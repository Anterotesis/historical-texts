AT Mr. Burke's time of life, and in his di&s;po|&s;itions, <HI>petere hone&s;tam dimi&s;&s;ionem</HI> was all he had to do with his political a&s;&s;ociates. This boon they have not cho&s;en to grant him. With many ex|pre&s;&s;ions of good-will, in effect they tell him he has loaded the &s;tage too long. They conceive it, tho' an har&s;h yet a nece&s;&s;ary office, in full parliament to declare to the pre&s;ent age, and to as late a po&s;teri|ty, as &s;hall take any concern in the proceedings of our day, that by one book he has di&s;graced the whole tenour of his life.&mdash;Thus they di&s;mi&s;s their old partner of the war. He is advi&s;ed to retire, whil&s;t they continue to &s;erve the public upon wi&s;er principles, and under better au&s;pices.</P>
<P>Whether Diogenes the Cynic was a true phi|lo&s;opher, cannot ea&s;ily be determined. He has written nothing. But the &s;ayings of his which are handed down by others, are lively; and may be ea&s;ily and aptly applied on many occa&s;ions by tho&s;e who&s;e wit is not &s;o perfect as their me|mory. This Diogenes (as every one will recollect) was citizen of a little bleak town &s;ituated on the coa&s;t of the Euxine, and expo&s;ed to all the buffets of that unho&s;pitable &s;ea. He lived at a great di&s;tance
<PB N="2" REF="3">
from tho&s;e weather-beaten walls, in ca&s;e and indo|lence, and in the mid&s;t of literary lei&s;ure, when he was informed that his town&s;men had condemned him to be bani&s;hed from Sinope; he an&s;wered coolly, <Q>&startq;And I condemn them to live in Sinope.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The gentlemen of the party in which Mr. Burke has always acted, in pa&s;&s;ing upon him the &s;entence of retirement <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>News-paper intelligence ought always to be received with &s;ome degree of caution. I do not know that the following pa|ragraph is founded on any authority; but it comes with an air of authority. The paper is profe&s;&s;edly in the intere&s;t of the modern Whigs, and under their direction. The para|graph is not di&s;claimed on their part. <Q>It profe&s;&s;es to be the deci&s;ion of tho&s;e whom its author calls &startq;The great and firm body of the Whigs of England.&endq;</Q> Who are the Whigs of a different compo&s;ition, which the promulgator of the &s;entence con&s;iders as compo&s;ed of fleeting and un&s;ettled particles, I know not, nor whether there be any of that de&s;cription. <Q>The de&s;initive &s;entence of &startq;the great and firm body of the Whigs of England&endq; (as this paper gives it out) is as follows:</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The great and firm body of the Whigs of England, true to their principles, have decided on the di&s;pute between Mr. Fox and Mr. Burke; and the former is declared to have maintained the pure doc|trines by which they are bound together, and upon which they have invariably acted. The con&s;equence is, that Mr. Burke retires from parliament.&endq;</Q> <HI>Morning Chronicle, May</HI> 12, 1791.</P></NOTE>, have done nothing more than to confirm the &s;entence which he had long before pa&s;&s;ed upon him&s;elf. When that retreat was choice, which the tribunal of his peers inflict as puni&s;h|ment, it is plain he does not think their &s;entence intolerably &s;evere. Whether they who are to con|tinue in the Sinope which &s;hortly he is to leave, will &s;pend the long years which, I hope, remain to them, in a manner more to their &s;atisfaction, than he &s;hall &s;lide down, in &s;ilence and ob&s;curity, the &s;lope of his declining days, is be&s;t known to him who mea&s;ures out years, and days, and for|tunes.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="4">
The quality of the &s;entence does not however decide on the ju&s;tice of it. Angry friend&s;hip is &s;ometimes as bad as calm enmity. For this rea|&s;on the cold neutrality of ab&s;tract ju&s;tice, is, to a good and clear cau&s;e, a more de&s;irable thing than an affection liable to be any way di&s;turbed. When the trial is by friends, if the deci&s;ion &s;hould happen to be favorable, the honor of the acquittal is le&s;&s;en|ed; if adver&s;e, the condemnation is exceedingly embittered. It is aggravated by coming from lips profe&s;&s;ing friend&s;hip, and pronouncing judgment with &s;orrow and reluctance. Taking in the whole view of life, it is more &s;afe to live under the juri&s;|diction of &s;evere but &s;teady rea&s;on, than under the empire of indulgent, but capricious pa&s;&s;ion. It is certainly well for Mr. Burke that there are impartial men in the world. To them I addre&s;s my&s;elf, pending the appeal which on his part is made from the living to the dead, from the mo|dern Whigs to the antient.</P>
<P>The gentlemen, who, in the name of the party, have pa&s;&s;ed &s;entence on Mr. Burke's book, in the light of literary critici&s;m are judges above all challenge. He did not indeed flatter him&s;elf, that as a writer, he could claim the approbation of men who&s;e talents, in his judgment and in the public judgment, approach to prodigies; if ever &s;uch per&s;ons &s;hould be di&s;po&s;ed to e&s;timate the merit of a compo&s;ition upon the &s;tandard of their own ability.</P>
<P>In their critical cen&s;ure, though Mr. Burke may find him&s;elf humbled by it as a writer, as a man and as an Engli&s;hman, he finds matter not only of con|&s;olation, but of pride. He propo&s;ed to convey to a foreign people, not his own ideas, but the prevalent opinions and &s;entiments of a nation, renowned for wi&s;dom, and celebrated in all ages for a well under|&s;tood
<PB N="4" REF="5">
and well regulated love of freedom. This was the avowed purpo&s;e of the far greater part of his work. As that work has not been ill received, and as his critics will not only admit but contend, that this reception could not be owing to any excellence in the compo&s;ition capable of perverting the public judgment, it is clear that he is not di&s;avowed by the nation who&s;e &s;entiments he had undertaken to de&s;cribe. His repre&s;entation is authenticated by the verdict of his country. Had his piece, as a work of &s;kill, been thought worthy of commenda|tion, &s;ome doubt might have been entertained of the cau&s;e of his &s;ucce&s;s. But the matter &s;tands exactly as he wi&s;hes it. He is more happy to have his fidelity in repre&s;entation recognized by the body of the people, than if he were to be ranked in point of ability (and higher he could not be ranked) with tho&s;e who&s;e critical cen&s;ure he has had the misfortune to incur.</P>
<P>It is not from this part of their deci&s;ion which the author wi&s;hes an appeal. There are things which touch him more nearly. To abandon them would not argue diffidence in his abilities, but treachery to his cau&s;e. Had his work been recognized as a pattern for dextrous argument, and powerful eloquence, yet if it tended to e&s;tabli&s;h maxims, or to in&s;pire &s;entiments, adver&s;e to the wi&s;e and free con&s;titution of this kingdom, he would only have cau&s;e to lament, that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed qualities fitted to perpetuate the memory of his offence. Oblivion would be the only means of his e&s;caping the re|proaches of po&s;terity. But, after receiving the com|mon allowance due to the common weakne&s;s of man, he wi&s;hes to owe no part of the indulgence of the world to its forgetfulne&s;s. He is at i&s;&s;ue with the party, before the pre&s;ent, and if ever he can reach it, before the coming, generation.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="6">
The author, &s;everal months previous to his pub|lication, well knew, that two gentlemen, both of them po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hed abilities, and of a mo&s;t deci&s;ive authority in the party, had differed with him in one of the mo&s;t material points relative to the French revolution; that is in their opinion of the behaviour of the French &s;oldiery, and its re|volt from its officers. At the time of their public declaration on this &s;ubject, he did not imagine the opinion of the&s;e two gentlemen had extended a great way beyond them&s;elves. He was however well aware of the great probability, that per&s;ons of their ju&s;t credit and influence would at length di&s;po&s;e the greater number to an agreement with their &s;entiments; and perhaps might induce the whole body to a tacit acquie&s;cence in their declara|tions, under a natural, and not always an improper, di&s;like of &s;hewing a difference with tho&s;e who lead their party. I will not deny, that in general this conduct in parties is defen&s;ible; but within what li|mits the practice is to be circum&s;cribed, and with what exceptions the doctrine which &s;upports it is to be received, it is not my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to define. The pre&s;ent que&s;tion has nothing to do with their motives; it only regards the public expre&s;&s;ion of their &s;entiments.</P>
<P>The author is compelled, however reluctantly, to receive the &s;entence pronounced upon him in the Hou&s;e of Commons as that of the party. It pro|ceeded from the mouth of him who mu&s;t be regard|ed as its authentic organ. In a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion which con|tinued for two days, no one gentleman of the oppo&s;i|tion interpo&s;ed a negative, or even a doubt, in favour of him or of his opinions. If an idea con&s;onant to the doctrine of his book, or favourable to his conduct, lurks in the minds of any per&s;ons in that de&s;cription, it is to con&s;idered only as a peculiarity which they
<PB N="6" REF="7">
indulge to their own private liberty of thinking. The author cannot reckon upon it. It has nothing to do with them as members of a party. In their public capacity, in every thing that meets the public ear, or public eye, the body mu&s;t be con&s;idered as una|nimous.</P>
<P>They mu&s;t have been animated with a very warm zeal again&s;t tho&s;e opinions, becau&s;e they were under no <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of acting as they did, from any ju&s;t cau&s;e of apprehen&s;ion that the errors of this writer &s;hould be taken for theirs. They might di&s;ap|prove; it was not nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould <HI>di&s;avow</HI> him, as they have done in the whole, and in all the parts of his book; becau&s;e neither in the whole nor in any of the parts, were they, directly, or by any implication, involved. The author was known in|deed to have been warmly, &s;trenuou&s;ly, and affec|tionately, again&s;t all allurements of ambition, and all po&s;&s;ibility of alienation from pride, or per&s;onal picque, or peevi&s;h jealou&s;y, attached to the Whig party. With one of them he has had a long friend|&s;hip, which he mu&s;t ever remember with a me|lancholy plea&s;ure. To the great, real, and ami|able virtues, and to the unequalled abilities of that gentleman, he &s;hall always join with his country in paying a ju&s;t tribute of applau&s;e. There are others in that party for whom, without any &s;hade of &s;orrow, he bears as high a degree of love as can enter into the human heart; and as much veneration as ought to be paid to human creatures; becau&s;e he firmly believes, that they are endowed with as many and as great virtues, as the nature of man is capable of producing, joined to great clearne&s;s of intellect, to a ju&s;t judgment, to a wonderful temper, and to true wi&s;dom. His &s;enti|ments with regard to them can never vary, with|out &s;ubjecting him to the ju&s;t indignation of man|kind,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
who are bound, and are generally di&s;po&s;ed, to look up with reverence to the be&s;t patterns of their &s;pecies, and &s;uch as give a dignity to the na|ture of which we all participate. For the whole of the party he has high re&s;pect. Upon a view indeed of the compo&s;ition of all parties, he finds great &s;atisfaction. It is, that in leaving the &s;er|vice of his country, he leaves parliament without all compari&s;on richer in abilities than he found it. Very &s;olid and very brilliant talents di&s;tingui&s;h the mini&s;terial benches. The oppo&s;ite rows are a &s;ort of &s;eminary of genius, and have brought forth &s;uch and &s;o great talents as never before (among&s;t us at lea&s;t) have appeared together at any one period. If their owners are di&s;po&s;ed to &s;erve their country, (he tru&s;ts they are) they are in a condition to ren|der it &s;ervices of the highe&s;t importance. If, through mi&s;take or pa&s;&s;ion, they are led to contribute to its ruin, we &s;hall at lea&s;t have a con&s;olation denied to the ruined country that adjoins us&mdash;we &s;hall not be de&s;troyed by men of mean or &s;econdary capacities.</P>
<P>All the&s;e con&s;iderations of party attachment, of per&s;onal regard, and of per&s;onal admiration, rendered the author of the Reflections extremely cautious, le&s;t the &s;lighte&s;t &s;u&s;picion &s;hould ari&s;e of his having undertaken to expre&s;s the &s;entiments even of a &s;ingle man of that de&s;cription. His words at the out&s;et of his Reflections are the&s;e:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;In the fir&s;t letter I had the honour to write to you, and which at length I &s;end, I wrote neither <HI>for,</HI> nor <HI>from</HI> any de&s;cription of men; nor &s;hall I in this. My errors, if any, are <HI>my own.</HI> My reputation <HI>alone</HI> is to an&s;wer for them.&endq;</Q> In another place, he &s;ays (p. 126.) <Q>&startq;I have <HI>no man's</HI> proxy. I &s;peak <HI>only</HI> from <HI>my&s;elf;</HI> when I di&s;claim, as I do, with all po&s;&s;ible earne&s;tne&s;s, all commu|nion with the actors in that triumph, or with the
<PB N="8" REF="9">
admirers of it. When I a&s;&s;ert any thing el&s;e, as concerning the people of England, I &s;peak from ob&s;ervation, <HI>not from authority.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
<P>To &s;ay then, that the book did not contain the &s;enti|ments of their party, is not to contradict the author, or to clear them&s;elves. If the party had denied his doctrines to be the current opinions of the majo|rity in the nation, they would have put the que&s;|tion on its true i&s;&s;ue. There, I hope and believe, his cen&s;urers will find on the trial, that the author is as faithful a repre&s;entative of the general &s;entiment of the people of England, as they can be of the ideas of their own party.</P>
<P>The French Revolution can have no connexion with the objects of any parties in England formed before the period of that event, unle&s;s they choo&s;e to imitate any of its acts, or to con&s;olidate any princi|ples of that revolution with their own opinions. The French revolution is no part of their original con|tract. The matter, &s;tanding by it&s;elf, is an open &s;ubject of political di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, like all the other re|volutions (and there are many) which have been attempted or accompli&s;hed in our age. But if any con&s;iderable number of Briti&s;h &s;ubjects, taking a factious intere&s;t in the proceedings of France, begin publicly to incorporate them&s;elves for the &s;ubver&s;ion of nothing &s;hort of the <HI>whole</HI> con&s;titution of this kingdom; to incorporate them&s;elves for the utter overthrow of the body of its laws, civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical, and with them of the whole &s;y&s;tem of its manners, in favour of the new con&s;titution, and of the modern u&s;ages of the French nation, I think no party principle could bind the author not to expre&s;s his &s;entiments &s;trongly again&s;t &s;uch a faction. On the contrary, he was perhaps bound to mark his di&s;&s;ent, when the leaders of the party were daily go|ing out of their way to make public declarations in
<PB N="9" REF="10">
parliament, which, notwith&s;tanding the purity of their intentions, had a tendency to encourage ill|de&s;igning men in their practices again&s;t our con|&s;titution.</P>
<P>The members of this faction leave no doubt of the nature and the extent of the mi&s;chief they mean to produce. They declare it openly and deci|&s;ively. Their intentions are not left equivocal. They are put out of all di&s;pute by the thanks which, formally and as it were officially, they i&s;&s;ue, in order to recommend, and to promote the cir|culation of the mo&s;t atrocious and trea&s;onable li|bels, again&s;t all the hitherto cheri&s;hed objects of the love and veneration of this people. Is it con|trary to the duty of a good &s;ubject, to reprobate &s;uch proceedings? Is it alien to the office of a good member of parliament, when &s;uch practices en|crea&s;e, when the audacity of the con&s;pirators grows with their impunity, to point out in his place their evil tendency to the happy con&s;titution which he is cho&s;en to guard? Is it wrong in any &s;en&s;e, to render the people of England &s;en&s;ible how much they mu&s;t &s;uffer if unfortunately &s;uch a wicked fac|tion &s;hould become po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in this country of the &s;ame power which their allies in the very next to us have &s;o perfidiou&s;ly u&s;urped, and &s;o outra|geou&s;ly abu&s;ed? Is it inhuman to prevent, if po&s;&s;i|ble, the &s;pilling of <HI>their</HI> blood, or imprudent to guard again&s;t the effu&s;ion of <HI>our own?</HI> Is it con|trary to any of the hone&s;t principles of party, or re|pugnant to any of the known duties of friend&s;hip for any &s;enator, re&s;pectfully, and amicably, to cau|tion his brother members again&s;t countenancing by incon&s;iderate expre&s;&s;ions a &s;ort of proceeding which it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould deliberately approve?</P>
<P>He had undertaken to demon&s;trate, by arguments which he thought could not be refuted, and by do|cuments, which he was &s;ure could not be denied,
<PB N="10" REF="11">
that no compari&s;on was to be made between the Bri|ti&s;h government, and the French u&s;urpation.&mdash;That they who endeavoured madly to compare them, were by no means making the compari&s;on of one good &s;y&s;tem with another good &s;y&s;tem, which va|ried only in local and circum&s;tantial differences; much le&s;s, that they were holding out to us a &s;upe|rior pattern of legal liberty, which we might &s;ub|&s;titute in the place of our old, and, as they de&s;cribe it, &s;uperannuated con&s;titution. He meant to de|mon&s;trate, that the French &s;cheme was not a com|parative good, but a po&s;itive evil.&mdash;That the que&s;|tion did not at all turn, as it had been &s;tated, on a parallel between a monarchy and a republic. He denied that the pre&s;ent &s;cheme of things in France, did at all de&s;erve the re&s;pectable name of a republic: he had therefore no compari&s;on be|tween monarchies and republics to make.&mdash;That what was done in France was a wild attempt to me|thodize anarchy; to perpetuate and fix di&s;order.&mdash;That it was a foul, impious, mon&s;trous thing, whol|ly out of the cour&s;e of moral nature. He un|dertook to prove, that it was generated in trea|chery, fraud, fal&s;ehood, hypocri&s;y, and unprovoked murder.&mdash;He offered to make out, that tho&s;e who have led in that bu&s;ine&s;s, had conducted them&s;elves with the utmo&s;t perfidy to their colleagues in func|tion, and with the mo&s;t flagrant perjury both to|wards their king and their con&s;tituents; to the one of whom the a&s;&s;embly had &s;worn fealty, and to the other, when under no &s;ort of violence or con&s;traint, they had &s;worn a full obedience to in&s;tructions.&mdash;That by the terror of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination they had driven away a very great number of the members, &s;o as to produce a fal&s;e appearance of a majority.&mdash;That this fictitious majority had fabricated a con&s;titution, which as now it &s;tands, is a tyranny far beyond any example that can be found in the civilized
<PB N="11" REF="12">
European world of our age; that therefore the lovers of it mu&s;t be lovers, not of liberty, but, if they at all under&s;tand it, of the lowe&s;t and ba&s;e&s;t of all &s;ervitude.</P>
<P>He propo&s;ed to prove, that the pre&s;ent &s;tate of things in France is not a tran&s;ient evil, productive, as &s;ome have too favourably repre&s;ented it, of a la&s;ting good; but that the pre&s;ent evil is only the means of producing future, and (if that were po&s;&s;ible) wor&s;e evils.&mdash;That it is not, an undige&s;ted, imper|fect, and crude &s;cheme of liberty, which may gradu|ally be mellowed and ripened into an orderly and &s;ocial freedom; but that it is &s;o fundamentally wrong, as to be utterly incapable of correcting it&s;elf by any length of time, or of being formed into any mode of polity, of which a member of the hou&s;e of commons could publicly declare his approba|tion.</P>
<P>If it had been permitted to Mr. Burke, he would have &s;hewn di&s;tinctly, and in detail, that what the a&s;&s;embly calling it&s;elf national, had held out as a large and liberal toleration, is in reality a cruel and in|&s;idious religious per&s;ecution; infinitely more bitter than any which had been heard of within this cen|tury.&mdash;That it had a feature in it wor&s;e than the old per&s;ecutions.&mdash;That the old per&s;ecutors acted, or pretended to act, from zeal towards &s;ome &s;y&s;tem of piety and virtue: they gave &s;trong preferences to their own; and if they drove people from one religion, they provided for them another, in which men might take refuge, and expect con&s;olation.&mdash;That their new per&s;ecution is not again&s;t a variety in con&s;cience, but again&s;t all con&s;cience.&mdash;That it profe&s;&s;es contempt towards its object; and whil&s;t it treats all religion with &s;corn, is not &s;o much as neutral about the modes: It unites the oppo&s;ite evils of intolerance and of indifference.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">
He could have proved that it is &s;o far from re|jecting te&s;ts (as unaccountably had been a&s;&s;erted) that the a&s;&s;embly had impo&s;ed te&s;ts of a peculiar hard&s;hip, ari&s;ing from a cruel and premeditated pecuniary fraud: te&s;ts again&s;t old principles, &s;anctioned by the laws, and binding upon the con&s;cience.&mdash;That the&s;e te&s;ts were not impo&s;ed as titles to &s;ome new honour or &s;ome new benefit, but to enable men to hold a poor com|pen&s;ation for their legal e&s;tates, of which they had been unju&s;tly deprived; and, as they had before been reduced from affluence to indigence, &s;o on refu&s;al to &s;wear again&s;t their con&s;cience, they are now driven from indigence to farnine, and treated with every po&s;&s;ible degree of outrage, in&s;ult, and inhumanity.&mdash;That the&s;e te&s;ts, which their impo&s;ers well knew would not be taken, were intended for the very purpo&s;e of cheating their mi&s;erable victims out of the compen&s;ation which the tyrannic im|po&s;tors of the a&s;&s;embly had previou&s;ly and pur|po&s;ely rendered the public unable to pay. That thus their ultimate violence aro&s;e from their origi|nal fraud.</P>
<P>He would have &s;hewn that the univer&s;al peace and concord among&s;t nations, which the&s;e common enemies to mankind had held out with the &s;ame frau|dulent ends and pretences with which they had uni|formly conducted every part of their proceedings, was a coar&s;e and clum&s;y deception, unworthy to be propo&s;ed as an example, by an informed and &s;a|gacious Briti&s;h &s;enator, to any other country.&mdash;That far from peace and good-will to men, they meditated war again&s;t all other governments; and propo&s;ed &s;y&s;tematically to excite in them all the very wor&s;t kind of &s;editions, in order to lead to their com|mon de&s;truction.&mdash;That they had di&s;covered, in the few in&s;tances in which they have hitherto had the power of di&s;covering it, (as at Avignon, and in
<PB N="13" REF="14">
the Comtat, at Cavailhon and at Carpentras) in what a &s;avage manner they mean to conduct the &s;editions and wars they have planned again&s;t their neighbours for the &s;ake of putting them&s;elves at the head of a con&s;$d$$ation of republics as wild and as mi&s;chievous as their own. He would have &s;hewn in what manner that wicked &s;cheme was carried on in tho&s;e places, without being directly either owned or di&s;claimed, in hopes that the un|done people &s;hould at length be obliged to fly to their tyrannic protection, as &s;ome &s;ort of refuge from their barbarous and treacherous ho&s;tility. He would have &s;hewn from tho&s;e examples, that neither this nor any other &s;ociety could be in &s;afety as long as &s;uch a public enemy was in a condition to continue directly or indirectly &s;uch practices again&s;t its peace.&mdash;That Great Britain was a principal ob|ject of their machinations; and that they had be|gun by e&s;tabli&s;hing corre&s;pondences, communica|tions, and a &s;ort of federal union with the factious here.&mdash;That no practical enjoyment of a thing &s;o imperfect and precarious, as human happine&s;s mu&s;t be, even under the very be&s;t of governments, could be a &s;ecurity for the exi&s;tence of the&s;e govern|ments, during the prevalence of the principles of France, propagated from that grand &s;chool of every di&s;order, and every vice.</P>
<P>He was prepared to &s;hew the madne&s;s of their declaration of the pretended rights of man; the childi&s;h futility of &s;ome of their maxims; the gro&s;s and &s;tupid ab&s;urdity and palpable fal&s;ity of others; and the mi&s;chievous tendency of all &s;uch declara|tions to the wellbeing of men and of citizens, and the &s;afety and pro&s;perity of every ju&s;t commonwealth. He was prepared to &s;hew that, in their conduct, the a&s;&s;embly had directly violated not only every ju&s;t principle of government, but every one, without exception, of their own fal&s;e or futile maxims; and
<PB N="14" REF="15">
indeed every rule they had pretended to lay down for their own direction.</P>
<P>In a word, he was ready to &s;hew, that tho&s;e who could, after &s;uch a full and fair expo&s;ure, con|tinue to countenance the French in&s;anity, were not mi&s;taken politicians, but bad men; but he thought that in this ca&s;e, as in many others, ignorance had been the cau&s;e of admiration.</P>
<P>The&s;e are &s;trong a&s;&s;ertions. They required &s;trong proofs. The member who laid down the&s;e po&s;itions was and is ready to give, in his place, to each po|&s;ition deci&s;ive evidence, corre&s;pondent to the na|ture and quality of the &s;everal allegations.</P>
<P>In order to judge on the propriety of the interrup|tion given to Mr. Burke, in his &s;peech on the com|mittee of the Quebec bill, it is nece&s;&s;ary to enquire, fir&s;t, whether, on general principles, Mr. Burke, ought to have been &s;uffered to prove his allegations? Secondly, whether the time he had cho&s;en was &s;o very un&s;ea&s;onable as to make his exerci&s;e of a par|liamentary right productive of ill effects on his friends or his country? Thirdly, whether the opi|nions delivered in his book, and which he had begun to expatiate upon that day, were in contra|diction to his former principles, and incon&s;i&s;tent with the tenor of his conduct? They who have made eloquent panegyrics on the French Revolution, and who think a free di&s;cu&s;&s;ion &s;o very advan|tageous in every ca&s;e, and under every circum|&s;tance, ought not, in my opinion, to have pre|vented their eulogies from being tried on the te&s;t of facts. If their panegyric had been an&s;wered with an invective (bating the difference in point of eloquence) the one would have been as good as the other: that is, they would both of them have been good for nothing. The panegyric and the &s;atire ought to be &s;uffered to go to trial; and that
<PB N="15" REF="16">
which &s;hrinks from it, mu&s;t be contented to &s;tand at be&s;t as a mere declamation.</P>
<P>I do not think Mr. Burke was wrong in the cour&s;e he took. That which &s;eemed to be recom|mended to him by Mr. Pitt, was rather to extol the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, than to attack the French. I do not determine what would be be&s;t for Mr. Pitt to do in his &s;ituation. I do not deny that <HI>he</HI> may have good rea&s;ons for his re&s;erve. Perhaps they might have been as good for a &s;imilar re&s;erve on the part of Mr. Fox, if his zeal had &s;uffered him to li&s;ten to them. But there were no motives of mini&s;terial prudence, or of that prudence which ought to guide a man perhaps on the eve of being mini&s;ter, to re&s;train the author of the Reflections. He is in no office under the crown; he is not the organ of any party.</P>
<P>The excellencies of the Briti&s;h con&s;titution had already exerci&s;ed and exhau&s;ted the talents of the be&s;t thinkers, and the mo&s;t eloquent writers and &s;peakers, that the world ever &s;aw. But in the pre|&s;ent ca&s;e, a &s;y&s;tem declared to be far better, and which certainly is much newer (to re&s;tle&s;s and un|&s;table minds no &s;mall recommendation) was held out to the admiration of the good people of Eng|land. In that ca&s;e, it was &s;urely proper for tho&s;e, who had far other thoughts of the French con&s;titu|tion, to &s;crutinize that plan which has been recom|mended to our imitation by active and zealous fac|tions, at home and abroad. Our complexion is &s;uch that we are palled with enjoyment, and &s;timu|lated with hope; that we become le&s;s &s;en&s;ible to a long-po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed benefit, from the very circum|&s;tance that it is become habitual. Specious, un|tried, ambiguous pro&s;pects of new advantage re|commend them&s;elves to the &s;pirit of adventure, which more or le&s;s prevails in every mind. From this temper, men, and factions, and nations too,
<PB N="16" REF="17">
have &s;acrificed the good, of which they had been in a&s;&s;ured po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in favour of wild and irrational expectations. What &s;hould hinder Mr. Burke, if he thought this temper likely, at one time or other, to prevail in our country, from expo&s;ing to a mul|titude, eager to game, the fal&s;e calculations of this lottery of fraud?</P>
<P>I allow, as I ought to do, for the effu&s;ions which come from a <HI>general</HI> zeal for liberty. This is to be indulged, and even to be encouraged, as long as the <HI>que&s;tion is general.</HI> An orator, above all men, ought to be allowed the full and free u&s;e of the prai&s;e of liberty. A common place in favour of &s;lavery and tyranny delivered to a popular a&s;&s;embly, would indeed be a bold defiance to all the princi|ples of rhetoric. But in a que&s;tion whether any particular con&s;titution is or is not a plan of ra|tional liberty, this kind of rhetorical flouri&s;h in favour of freedom in general, is &s;urely a little out of its place. It is virtually a begging of the que&s;tion. It is a &s;ong of triumph, before the battle.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;But Mr. Fox does not make the panegyric of the new con&s;titution; it is the de&s;truction only of the ab&s;olute monarchy he commends.&endq;</Q> When that namele&s;s thing which has been lately &s;et up in France was de&s;cribed as <Q>&startq;the mo&s;t &s;tupendous and glorious edifice of liberty, which had been erect|ed on the foundation of human integrity in any time or country,&endq;</Q> it might at fir&s;t, have led the hearer into an opinion, that the con|&s;truction of the new fabric was an object of admi|ration, as well as the demolition of the old. The gentleman, however, has explained him&s;elf; and it would be too like that captious and cavilling &s;pirit, which I &s;o perfectly dete&s;t, if I were to pin down the language of an eloquent and ardent mind, to the punctilious exactne&s;s of a pleader. Then Mr. Fox did not mean to applaud that mon&s;trous thing,
<PB N="17" REF="18">
which, by the courte&s;y of France, they call a con|&s;titution. I ea&s;ily believe it. Far from meriting the prai&s;es of a great genius like Mr. Fox, it can|not be approved by any man of common &s;en&s;e, or common information. He cannot admire the change of one piece of barbari&s;m for another, and a wor&s;e. He cannot rejoice at the de&s;truction of a monar|chy, mitigated by manners, re&s;pectful to laws and u&s;ages, and attentive, perhaps but too attentive to public opinion, in favour of the tyranny of a licen|tious, ferocious, and &s;avage multitude, without laws, manners, or morals, and which &s;o far from re&s;pect|ing the general &s;en&s;e of mankind, in&s;olently endea|vours to alter all the principles and opinions, which have hitherto guided and contained the world, and to force them into a conformity to their views and actions. His mind is made to better things.</P>
<P>That a man &s;hould rejoice and triumph in the de&s;truction of an ab&s;olute monarchy; that in &s;uch an event he &s;hould overlook the captivity, di&s;|grace, and degradation of an unfortunate prince, and the continual danger to a life which exi&s;ts only to be endangered; that he &s;hould overlook the utter ruin of whole orders and cla&s;&s;es of men, extending it|&s;elf directly, or in its neare&s;t con&s;equences, to at lea&s;t a million of our kind, and to at lea&s;t the temporary wretchedne&s;s of an whole community, I do not de|ny to be in &s;ome &s;ort natural: Becau&s;e, when people &s;ee a political object, which they ardently de&s;ire, but in one point of view, they are apt extremely to pal|liate, or underrate the evils which may ari&s;e in ob|taining it. This is no reflection on the humanity of tho&s;e per&s;ons. Their good-nature I am the la&s;t man in the world to di&s;pute. It only &s;hews that they are not &s;ufficiently informed, or &s;ufficiently con&s;iderate. When they come to reflect &s;eriou&s;ly on the tran&s;action, they will think them&s;elves bound to examine what that object is that has been ac|quired by all this havock. They will hardly a&s;&s;ert
<PB N="18" REF="19">
that the de&s;truction of an ab&s;olute monarchy, is a thing good in it&s;elf, without any &s;ort of reference to the antecedent &s;tate of things, or to con&s;equences which re&s;ult from the change; without any con&s;ider|ation whether a country was, to a con&s;iderable de|gree, flouri&s;hing and populous, highly cultivated, and highly commercial; and whether, under that domination, though per&s;onal liberty had been pre|carious and in&s;ecure, property at lea&s;t was ever violated. They cannot take the moral &s;ympathies of the human mind along with them, in ab&s;tractions &s;eparated from the good or evil condition of the &s;tate, from the quality of actions, and the character of the actors. None of us love ab&s;olute and un|controlled monarchy&mdash;but we could not rejoice at the &s;ufferings of a Marcus Aurelius, or a Trajan, who were ab&s;olute monarchs, as we do when Nero is condemned by the &s;enate to be puni&s;hed <HI>more majorum:</HI> Nor when that mon&s;ter was obliged to fly with his wife Sporus, and to drink puddle, were men affected in the &s;ame manner, as when the ve|nerable Galba, with all his faults and errors, was murdered by a revolted mercenary &s;oldiery? With &s;uch things before our eyes our feelings contradict our theories&mdash;and when this is the ca&s;e, the feel|ings are true, and the theory is fal&s;e. All I con|tend for is, that in commending the de&s;truction of an ab&s;olute monarchy, <HI>all the circum&s;tances</HI> ought not to be wholly overlooked, as con&s;iderations fit only for &s;hallow and &s;uperficial minds.</P>
<P>The &s;ubver&s;ion of a government, to de&s;erve any prai&s;e, mu&s;t be con&s;idered but as a &s;tep preparatory to the formation of &s;omething better, either in the &s;cheme of the government it&s;elf, or in the per&s;ons who admini&s;ter in it, or in both. The&s;e events can|not in rea&s;on be &s;eparated. For in&s;tance, when we prai&s;e our revolution of 1688, though the nation, in that act, was on the defen&s;ive, and was ju&s;tified
<PB N="19" REF="20">
in incurring all the evils of a defen&s;ive war, we do not re&s;t there. We always combine with the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the old government the happy &s;ettlement which followed. When we e&s;timate that revolu|tion, we mean to comprehend in our calculation both the value of the thing parted with, and the value of the thing received in exchange.</P>
<P>The burthen of proof lies heavily on tho&s;e who tear to pieces the whole frame and contexture of their country, that they could find no other way of &s;ettling a government fit to obtain its rational ends, except that which they have pur&s;ued by means unfavourable to all the pre&s;ent happine&s;s of millions of people, and to the utter ruin of &s;everal hundreds of thou&s;ands. In their political arrangements, men have no right to put the well-being of the pre&s;ent generation wholly out of the que&s;tion. Perhaps the only moral tru&s;t with any certainty in our hands, is the care of our own time. With regard to futurity, we are to treat it like a ward. We are not &s;o to attempt an improvement of his fortune, as to put the capital of his e&s;tate to any hazard.</P>
<P>It is not worth our while to di&s;cu&s;s, like &s;ophi&s;ters, whether, in no ca&s;e, &s;ome evil, for the &s;ake of &s;ome benefit is to be tolerated. Nothing univer&s;al can be rationally affirmed on any moral, or any politi|cal &s;ubject. Pure metaphy&s;ical ab&s;traction does not belong to the&s;e matters. The lines of morality are not like the ideal lines of mathematics. They are broad and deep as well as long. They admit of ex|ceptions; they demand modifications. The&s;e ex|ceptions and modifications are not made by the proce&s;s of logic, but by the rules of prudence. Pru|dence is not only the fir&s;t in rank of the virtues poli|tical and moral, but &s;he is the director, the regu|lator, the &s;tandard of them all. Metaphy&s;ics can|not live without definition; but prudence is cau|tious how &s;he defines. Our courts cannot be more
<PB N="20" REF="21">
fearful in &s;uffering fictitious ca&s;es to be brought be|fore them for eliciting their determination on a point of law, than prudent morali&s;ts are in putting ex|treme and hazardous ca&s;es of con&s;cience upon emer|gencies not exi&s;ting. Without attempting there|fore to define, what never can be defined, the ca&s;e of a revolution in government, this, I think, may be &s;afely affirmed, that a &s;ore and pre&s;&s;ing evil is to be removed, and that a good, great in its amount, and unequivocal in its nature, mu&s;t be probable almo&s;t to certainty, before the ine&s;timable price of our own morals, and the well-being of a number of our fellow-citizens, is paid for a revolution. If ever we ought to be oeconomi&s;ts even to par&s;imony, it is in the voluntary production of evil. Every revolution contains in it &s;omething of evil.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t always be, to tho&s;e who are the greate&s;t amateurs, or even profe&s;&s;ors of revolutions, a mat|ter very hard to prove, whether the late French government was &s;o bad, that nothing wor&s;e, in the infinite devices of men, could come in its place. They who have brought France to its pre&s;ent con|dition ought to prove al&s;o, by &s;omething better than prattling about the Ba&s;tile, that their &s;ubverted government was as incapable, as the pre&s;ent cer|tainly is, of all improvement and correction. How dare they to &s;ay &s;o who have never made that expe|riment? They are experimentors by their trade. They have made an hundred others, infinitely more hazardous.</P>
<P>The Engli&s;h admirers of the forty-eight thou&s;and republics which form the French federation, prai&s;e them not for what they are, but for what they are to become. They do not talk as politicians but as prophets. But in whatever character they choo&s;e to found panegyric on prediction, it will be thought a little &s;ingular to prai&s;e any work, not for its own merits, but for the merits of &s;omething el&s;e which
<PB N="21" REF="22">
may &s;ucceed to it. When any political in&s;titution is prai&s;ed, in &s;pite of great and prominent faults of every kind, and in all its parts, it mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;omething excellent in its fundamental prin|ciples. It mu&s;t be &s;hewn that it is right though imperfect; that it is not only by po&s;&s;ibility &s;u&s;cep|tible of improvement, but that it contains in it a principle tending to its melioration.</P>
<P>Before they attempt to &s;hew this progre&s;&s;ion of their favourite work, from ab&s;olute pravity to fini&s;hed perfection, they will find them&s;elves engaged in a civil war with tho&s;e who&s;e cau&s;e they maintain. What! alter our &s;ublime con&s;titution, the glory of France, the envy of the world, the pattern for man|kind, the ma&s;ter-piece of legi&s;lation, the collected and concentrated glory of this enlightened age! Have we not produced it ready made and ready armed, ma|ture in its birth, a perfect godde&s;s of wi&s;dom and of war, hammered by our black&s;mith midwives out of the brain of Jupiter him&s;elf? Have we not &s;worn our devout, profane, believing, infidel people, to an allegiance to this godde&s;s, even before &s;he had bur&s;t the <HI>dura mater,</HI> and as yet exi&s;ted only in embryo? Have we not &s;olemnly declared this con&s;titution unalterable by any future legi&s;lature? Have we not bound it on po&s;terity for ever, though our abettors have declared that no one generation is competent to bind another? Have we not obliged the members of every future a&s;&s;embly to qualify them&s;elves for their &s;eats by &s;wearing to its con|&s;ervation?</P>
<P>Indeed the French con&s;titution always mu&s;t (if they do not change all their principles and funda|mental arrangements) be a government wholly by popular repre&s;entation. It mu&s;t be this or nothing. The French faction con&s;iders as an u&s;urpation, as an atrocious violation of the indefea&s;ible rights of man, every other de&s;cription of government. Take it
<PB N="22" REF="23">
or leave it; there is no medium. Let the irrefra|gable doctors fight out their own controver&s;y in their own way, and with their own weapons; and when they are tired let them commence a treaty of peace. Let the plenipotentiary &s;ophi&s;ters of Eng|land &s;ettle with the diplomatic &s;ophi&s;ters of France in what manner right is to be corrected by an infu|&s;ion of wrong, and how truth may be rendered more true by a due intermixture of fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>Having &s;ufficiently proved, that nothing could make it <HI>generally</HI> improper for Mr. Burke to prove what he had alledged concerning the object of this di&s;pute, I pa&s;s to the &s;econd que&s;tion, that is, whe|ther Mr. Burke was ju&s;tified in choo&s;ing the com|mittee on the Quebec bill as the field for this di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion? If it were nece&s;&s;ary, it might be &s;hewn, that Mr. Burke was not the fir&s;t to bring the&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ions into parliament, nor the fir&s;t to renew them in this &s;e&s;&s;ion. The fact is notorious. As to the Quebec bill, they were introduced there for two plain rea|&s;ons; fir&s;t, that as he thought it <HI>then</HI> not advi&s;eable to make the proceedings of the factious &s;ocieties the &s;ubject of a direct motion, he had no other way open to him. Nobody has attempted to &s;hew, that it was at all admi&s;&s;ible into any other bu&s;ine&s;s before the hou&s;e. Here every thing was favourable. Here was a bill to form a new con&s;titution for a French province under Engli&s;h dominion. The que&s;tion naturally aro&s;e, whether we &s;hould &s;ettle that con|&s;titution upon Engli&s;h ideas, or upon French. This furni&s;hed an opportunity for examining into the value of the French con&s;titution, either con&s;ider|ed as applicable to colonial government, or in its own nature. The bill too was in a committee. By the privilege of &s;peaking as often as he plea&s;ed, he hoped in &s;ome mea&s;ure to &s;upply the want of &s;upport, which he had but too much rea&s;on to apprehend. In a committee it was always in his power to bring
<PB N="23" REF="24">
the que&s;tions from generalities to facts; from de|clamation to di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. Some benefit he actually found from this privilege. The&s;e are plain, ob|vious, natural rea&s;ons for his conduct. I believe they are the true, and the only true ones.</P>
<P>They who ju&s;tify the frequent interruptions, which at length wholly di&s;abled him from proceeding, attri|bute their conduct to a very different interpretation of his motives. They &s;ay, that through corruption, or malice, or folly, he was acting his part in a plot to make his friend Mr. FOX pa&s;s for a republican; and thereby to prevent the gracious intentions of his &s;o|vereign from taking effect, which at that time had began to di&s;clo&s;e them&s;elves in his favour <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>To explain this, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to advert to a para|graph which appeared in a paper in the minority intere&s;t &s;ome time before this debate. <Q>&startq;A very dark intrigue has lately been di&s;covered, the authors of which are well known to us; but until the glorious day &s;hall come, when it will not be a LIBEL to tell the TRUTH, we mu&s;t not be &s;o regardle&s;s of our own &s;afety, as to publi&s;h their names. We will, how|ever, &s;tate the fact, leaving it to the ingenuity of our readers&endq; to di&s;cover what we dare not publi&s;h.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Since the bu&s;ine&s;s of the armament again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia has been&endq; under di&s;cu&s;&s;ion, a great per&s;onage has been heard to &s;ay,</Q> <Q>&startq;that he was not &s;o wedded to Mr. PITT, as not to be very willing to give his confidence to Mr. FOX, if the latter &s;hould be able, in a cri&s;is like the pre&s;ent, to conduct the government of the country with greater advantage to the public.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;This patriotic declaration immediately alarmed the &s;warm of courtly in&s;ects that live only in the &s;un&s;hine of mini&s;terial favour. It was thought to be the forerunner of the di&s;mi&s;|&s;ion of Mr. PITT, and every engine was &s;et at work for the purpo&s;e of preventing &s;uch an event. The principle engine employed on this occa&s;ion, was CALUMNY. It was whi&s;|pered in the ear of a great per&s;onage, that Mr. FOX was the la&s;t man in England to be tru&s;ted by a KING, becau&s;e he was by PRINCIPLE a REPUBLICAN, and con&s;equently an&endq; enemy to MONARCHY.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;In the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the Quebec bill which &s;tood for ye&s;ter|day, it was the intention of &s;ome per&s;ons to connect with this &s;ubject the French Revolution, in hopes that Mr. FOX would be warmed by a colli&s;ion with Mr. Burke, and induced to de|fend that revolution in which &s;o much power was taken&endq; from, and &s;o little left in, the crown.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Had Mr. Fox fallen into the &s;nare, his &s;peech on the occa|&s;ion would have been laid before a great per&s;onage, as a proof that a man who could defend &s;uch a revolution, might be a very good republican, but could not po&s;&s;ibly be a friend&endq; to monarchy.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;But tho&s;e who laid the &s;nare were di&s;appointed; for Mr. Fox, in the &s;hort conver&s;ation which took place ye&s;terday in the hou&s;e of commons &s;aid, that he confe&s;&s;edly had thought favorably of the French revolution; but that mo&s;t certainly he never had, either in parliament or out of parliament, pro|fe&s;&s;ed or defended republican principles.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Argus, April 22d, 1791.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke cannot an&s;wer for the truth, nor prove the fal&s;e|hood of the &s;tory given by the friends of the party in this paper. He only knows that an opinion of its being well or ill authen|ticated had no influence on his conduct. He meant only, to the be&s;t of his power, to guard the public again&s;t the ill de&s;igns of factions out of doors. What Mr. Burke did in parliament could hardly have been intended to draw Mr. Fox into any declara|tions unfavourable to his principles, &s;ince (by the account of tho&s;e who are his friends) he had long before effectually pre|vented the &s;ucce&s;s of any &s;uch &s;candalous de&s;igns; they have them&s;elves done away that imputation on Mr. Burke.</P></NOTE>.This
<PB N="24" REF="25">
is a pretty &s;erious charge. This, on Mr. Burke's part, would be &s;omething more than mi&s;take; &s;omething wor&s;e than formal irregularity. Any contumely, any outrage is readily pa&s;&s;ed over, by the indulgence which we all owe to &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion. The&s;e things are &s;oon forgot upon occa&s;ions in which all men are &s;o apt to forget them&s;elves. De|liberate injuries, to a degree mu&s;t be remembered, becau&s;e they require deliberate precautions to be &s;ecured again&s;t their return.</P>
<P>I am authorized to &s;ay for Mr. Burke, that he con&s;iders that cau&s;e a&s;&s;igned for the outrage offered to him, as ten times wor&s;e than the outrage it&s;elf. There is &s;uch a &s;trange confu&s;ion of ideas on this &s;ubject, that it is far more difficult to under&s;tand the nature of the charge, than to refute it when under&s;tood. Mr. Fox's friends were, it &s;eems, &s;eized with a &s;udden panic terror le&s;t he &s;hould
<PB N="25" REF="26">
pa&s;s for a republican. I do not think they had any ground for this apprehen&s;ion. But let us admit they had. What was there in the Quebec bill, ra|ther than in any other, which could &s;ubject him or them to that imputation? Nothing in a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the French con&s;titution, which might ari&s;e on the Quebec bill, could tend to make Mr. Fox pa&s;s for a republican; except he &s;hould take oc|ca&s;ion to extol that &s;tate of things in France, which affects to be a republic or a confederacy of re|publics. If &s;uch an encomium could make any unfavourable impre&s;&s;ion on the king's mind, &s;urely his voluntary panegyrics on that event, not &s;o much introduced as intruded into other debates, with which they had little relation, mu&s;t have produced that effect with much more certainty, and much greater force. The Quebec bill, at wor&s;t, was only one of tho&s;e opportunities, carefully &s;ought, and in|du&s;triou&s;ly improved by him&s;elf. Mr. Sheridan had already brought forth a panegyric on the French &s;y&s;tem in a &s;till higher &s;train, with full as little de|mand from the nature of the bu&s;ine&s;s before the hou&s;e, in a &s;peech too good to be &s;peedily forgot|ten. Mr. Fox followed him without any direct call from the &s;ubject matter, and upon the &s;ame ground. To canva&s;s the merits of the French con&s;titution on the Quebec bill could not draw forth any opi|nions which were not brought forward before, with no &s;mall o&s;tentation, and with very little of ne|ce&s;&s;ity, or perhaps of propriety. What mode, or what time of di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the conduct of the French faction in England would not equally tend to kindle this enthu&s;ia&s;m, and afford tho&s;e occa&s;ions for pane|gyric, which, far from &s;hunning, Mr. Fox has always indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought? He him&s;elf &s;aid very truly, in the debate, that no artifices were nece&s;&s;ary to draw from him his opinions upon that &s;ubject. But to fall upon Mr. Burke for making an u&s;e, at wor&s;t
<PB N="26" REF="27">
not more irregular, of the &s;ame liberty, is tan|tamount to a plain declaration, that the topic of France is <HI>tabooed</HI> or forbidden ground to Mr. Burke, and to Mr. Burke alone. But &s;urely Mr. Fox is not a republican; and what &s;hould hinder him, when &s;uch a di&s;cu&s;&s;ion came on, from clearing him|&s;elf unequivocally (as his friends &s;ay he had done near a fortnight before) of all &s;uch imputations? In&s;tead of being a di&s;advantage to him, he would have defeated all his enemies, and Mr. Burke, &s;ince he has thought proper to reckon him among&s;t them.</P>
<P>But it &s;eems, &s;ome news-paper or other had im|puted to him republican principles, on occa&s;ion of his conduct upon the Quebec bill. Suppo&s;ing Mr. Burke to have &s;een the&s;e news-papers (which is to &s;uppo&s;e more than I believe to be true) I would a&s;k, when did the news-papers forbear to charge Mr. Fox, or Mr. Burke him&s;elf, with republican principles, or any other principles which they thought could render both of them odious, &s;ometimes to one de&s;cription of people, &s;ometimes to another. Mr. Burke, &s;ince the publication of his pamphlet, has been a thou&s;and times charged in the news-papers with holding de|&s;potic principles. He could not enjoy one moment of dome&s;tic quiet, he could not perform the lea&s;t particle of public duty, if he did not altogether di&s;regard the language of tho&s;e libels. But how|ever his &s;en&s;ibility might be affected by &s;uch abu&s;e, it would in <HI>him</HI> have been thought a mo&s;t ridicu|lous rea&s;on for &s;hutting up the mouths of Mr. Fox, or Mr. Sheridan, &s;o as to prevent their delivering their &s;entiments of the French revolution,&mdash;that for&s;ooth, <Q>&startq;the news-papers had lately charged Mr. Burke with being an enemy to liberty.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I allow that tho&s;e gentlemen have privileges to which Mr. Burke has no claim. But their friends ought to plead tho&s;e privileges; and not to a&s;&s;ign bad
<PB N="27" REF="28">
rea&s;ons, on the principle of what is fair between man and man, and thereby to put them&s;elves on a level with tho&s;e who can &s;o ea&s;ily refute them. Let them &s;ay at once that his reputation is of no value, and that he has no call to a&s;&s;ert it; but that theirs is of infinite concern to the party and the public; and to that con&s;ideration he ought to &s;acrifice all his opinions, and all his feelings.</P>
<P>In that language I &s;hould hear a &s;tyle corre|&s;pondent to the proceeding; lofty, indeed, but plain and con&s;i&s;tent. Admit, however, for a moment, and merely for argument, that this gentleman had as good a right to continue as they had to begin the&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, in candour and equity they mu&s;t allow that their voluntary de&s;cant in prai&s;e of the French con&s;titution was as much an oblique attack on Mr. Burke, as Mr. Burke's enquiry into the foundation of this encomium could po&s;&s;ibly be con&s;trued into an imputation upon them. They well knew, that he felt like other men; and of cour&s;e he would think it mean and unworthy, to decline a&s;&s;erting in his place, and in the front of able adver&s;aries, the principles of what he had penned in his clo&s;et, without an opponent before him. They could not, but be convinced, that declamations of this kind would rouze him; that he mu&s;t think that coming from men of their <HI>calibre,</HI> they were highly mi&s;|chievous; that they gave countenance to bad men, and bad de&s;igns; and, though he was aware that the handling &s;uch matters in parliament was delicate, yet he was a man very likely, whenever much again&s;t his will they were brought there, to re&s;olve that there they &s;hould be thoroughly &s;ifted. Mr. Fox, early in the preceding &s;e&s;&s;ion, had public notice from Mr. Burke of the light in which he con|&s;idered every attempt to introduce the example of France into the politics of this country; and of his re&s;olution to break with his be&s;t friends,
<PB N="28" REF="29">
and to join with his wor&s;t enemies to prevent it. He hoped, that no &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity would ever exi&s;t. But in ca&s;e it &s;hould, his determination was made. The party knew perfectly that he would at lea&s;t defend him&s;elf. He never intended to attack Mr. Fox, nor did he attack him directly or indirectly. His &s;peech kept to its matter. No per&s;onality was employed even in the remote&s;t allu&s;ion. He never did impute to that gentlemen any republican prin|ciples, or any other bad principles or bad conduct what&s;oever. It was far from his words; it was far from his heart. It mu&s;t be remembered, that not|with&s;tanding Mr. Fox, in order to fix on Mr. Burke an unju&s;tifiable change of opinion, and the foul crime of teaching a &s;et of maxims to a boy, and afterwards, when the&s;e maxims became adult in his mature age, of abandoning both the di&s;ciple and the doctrine, Mr. Burke never attempted, in any one particular, either to criminate or to recrimi|nate. It may be &s;aid, that he had nothing of the kind in his power. This he does not controvert. He certainly had it not in his inclination. That gentleman had as little ground for the charges which he was &s;o ea&s;ily provoked to make upon him.</P>
<P>The gentlemen of the party (I include Mr. Fox) have been kind enough to con&s;ider the di&s;pute brought on by this bu&s;ine&s;s, and their con&s;equent &s;eparation of Mr. Burke from their corps, as a matter of regret and unea&s;ine&s;s. I cannot be of opinion, that by his exclu&s;ion they have had any lo&s;s at all. A man who&s;e opinions are &s;o very ad|ver&s;e to theirs, adver&s;e, as it was expre&s;&s;ed, <Q>as pole to pole,</Q> &s;o mi&s;chievou&s;ly as well as &s;o di|rectly adver&s;e, that they found them&s;elves under the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;olemnly di&s;claiming them in full parlia|ment, &s;uch a man mu&s;t ever be to them a mo&s;t un|&s;eemly and unprofitable incumbrance. A co-opera|tion with him could only &s;erve to embarra&s;s them in
<PB N="29" REF="30">
all their councils. They have be&s;ides publickly re|pre&s;ented him as a man capable of abu&s;ing the doci|lity and confidence of ingenuous youth; and, for a bad rea&s;on, or for no rea&s;on, of di&s;gracing his whole public life by a &s;candalous contradiction of every one of his own acts, writings, and declarations. If the&s;e charges be true, their exclu&s;ion of &s;uch a per&s;on from their body is a circum&s;tance which does equal honour to their ju&s;tice and their prudence. If they expre&s;s a degree of &s;en&s;ibility in being obliged to execute this wi&s;e and ju&s;t &s;entence, from a con&s;i|deration of &s;ome amiable or &s;ome plea&s;ant quali|ties which in his private life their former friend may happen to po&s;&s;e&s;s, they add, to the prai&s;e of their wi&s;dom and firmne&s;s, the merit of great tenderne&s;s of heart, and humanity of di&s;po&s;ition.</P>
<P>On their ideas, the new Whig party have, in my opinion, acted as became them. The author of the Reflections, however, on his part, cannot, with|out great &s;hame to him&s;elf, and without entailing everla&s;ting di&s;grace on his po&s;terity, admit the truth or ju&s;tice of the charges which have been made upon him; or allow that he has in tho&s;e Reflections di&s;covered any principles to which hone&s;t men are bound to declare, not a &s;hade or two of di&s;&s;ent, but a total fundamental oppo&s;ition. He mu&s;t believe, if he does not mean wilfully to abandon his cau&s;e and his reputation, that principles fundamentally at variance with tho&s;e of his book, are fundamentally fal&s;e. What tho&s;e principles, the antipodes to his, really are, he can only di&s;cover from that contrariety. He is very unwilling to &s;uppo&s;e, that the doctrines of &s;ome books lately circulated are the principles of the party; though, from the vehement declara|tions again&s;t his opinions, he is at &s;ome lo&s;s how to judge otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>For the pre&s;ent, my plan does not render it ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;ay any thing further concerning the me|rits
<PB N="30" REF="31">
either of the one &s;et of opinions or the other. The author would have di&s;cu&s;&s;ed the merits of both in his place, but he was not permitted to do &s;o pa&s;s to the next head of charge, Mr. Burke's incon&s;i&s;tency. It is certainly a great aggravation of the fault of embracing fal&s;e opinions, that in doing &s;o, in his ca&s;e, he is not &s;uppo&s;ed to fill up a void, but that he is guilty of a dereliction of opinions that are true and laudable. This is the great gi&s;t of the charge again&s;t him. It is not &s;o much that he is wrong in his book (that however is alledged al&s;o) as that he has therein belyed his whole life. I believe (if he could venture to va|lue him&s;elf upon any thing) it is on the virtue of con&s;i&s;tency that he would value him&s;elf the mo&s;t. Strip him of this, and you leave him naked indeed.</P>
<P>In the ca&s;e of any man who had written &s;ome|thing, and &s;poken a great deal, upon very multifa|rious matter, during upwards of twenty-five years public &s;ervice, and in as great a variety of import|ant events as perhaps have ever happened in the &s;ame number of years, it would appear a little hard, in order to charge &s;uch a man with incon&s;i&s;tency, to &s;ee collected by his friend, a &s;ort of dige&s;t of his &s;ayings, even to &s;uch as were merely &s;portive and jocular. This dige&s;t, however, has been made, with equal pains and partiality, and without bringing out tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages of his writings which might tend to &s;hew with what re&s;trictions any ex|pre&s;&s;ions, quoted from him, ought to have been under&s;tood. From a great &s;tate&s;man he did not quite expect this mode of inqui&s;ition. If it only appeared in the works of common pamphleteers, Mr. Burke might &s;afely tru&s;t to his reputation. When thus urged, he ought, perhaps, to do a little more. It &s;hall be as little as po&s;&s;ible, for I hope not much is wanting. To be totally &s;ilent on his
<PB N="31" REF="32">
charges would not be re&s;pectful to Mr. Fox. Ac|cu&s;ations &s;ometimes derive a weight from the per|&s;ons who make them, to which they are not en|titled from their matter.</P>
<P>He that thinks that the Briti&s;h con&s;titution ought to con&s;i&s;t of the three members, of three very dif|ferent natures, of which it does actually con&s;i&s;t, and thinks it his duty to pre&s;erve each of tho&s;e mem|bers in its proper place, and with its proper pro|portion of power, mu&s;t (as each &s;hall happen to be attacked) vindicate the three &s;everal parts on the &s;everal principles peculiarly belonging to them. He cannot a&s;&s;ert the democratic part on the princi|ples on which monarchy is &s;upported; nor can he &s;upport monarchy on the principles of democracy; nor can he maintain ari&s;tocracy on the grounds of the one or of the other, or of both. All the&s;e he mu&s;t &s;upport on grounds that are totally differ|ent, though practically they may be, and happily with us they are, brought into one harmonious body. A man could not be con&s;i&s;tent in defending &s;uch various, and, at fir&s;t view, di&s;cordant parts of a mixed con&s;titution, without that &s;ort of incon&s;i&s;t|ency with which Mr. Burke &s;tands charged.</P>
<P>As any one of the great members of this con&s;titu|tion happen to be endangered, he that is a friend to all of them choo&s;es and pre&s;&s;es the topics nece&s;&s;ary for the &s;upport of the part attacked, with all the &s;trength, the earne&s;tne&s;s, the vehemence, with all the power of &s;tating, of argument, and of colouring, which he happens to po&s;&s;e&s;s, and which the ca&s;e demands. He is not to embarra&s;s the minds of his hearers, or to encumber, or overlay his &s;peech, by bringing into view at once (as if he were reading an aca|demic lecture) all that may and ought, when a ju&s;t occa&s;ion pre&s;ents it&s;elf, to be &s;aid in favour of the other members. At that time they are out of the court; there is no que&s;tion concerning them.
<PB N="32" REF="33">
Whil&s;t he oppo&s;es his defence on the part where the attack is made, he pre&s;umes, that for his regard to the ju&s;t rights of all the re&s;t, he has credit in every candid mind. He ought not to apprehend, that his rai&s;ing fences about popular privileges this day, will infer that he ought, on the next, to concur with tho&s;e who would pull down the throne: becau&s;e on the next he defends the throne, it ought not to be &s;up|po&s;ed that he has abandoned the rights of the people.</P>
<P>A man who, among various objects of his equal regard, is &s;ecure of &s;ome, and full of anxiety for the fate of others, is apt to go to much greater lengths in his preference of the objects of his imme|diate &s;olicitude than Mr. Burke has ever done. A man &s;o circum&s;tanced often &s;eems to undervalue, to vilify, almo&s;t to reprobate and di&s;own, tho&s;e that are out of danger. This is the voice of nature and truth, and not of incon&s;i&s;tency and fal&s;e pretence. The danger of any thing very dear to us, removes, for the moment, every other affection from the mind. When Priam had his whole thoughts em|ployed on the body of his Hector, he repels with indignation, and drives from him with a thou&s;and reproaches, his &s;urviving &s;ons, who with an officious piety crouded about him to offer their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. A good critic (there is no better than Mr. Fox) would &s;ay, that this is a ma&s;ter-&s;troke, and marks a deep under&s;tanding of nature in the father of poetry. He would de&s;pi&s;e a Zoilus, who would conclude from this pa&s;&s;age that Homer meant to repre&s;ent this man of affliction as hating or being indifferent and cold in his affections to the poor reliques of his hou&s;e, or that he preferred a dead carca&s;e to his living children.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke does not &s;tand in need of an allowance of this kind, which, if he did, by candid critics ought to be granted to him. If the principles of a mixed
<PB N="33" REF="34">
con&s;titution be admitted, he wants no more to ju&s;tify to con&s;i&s;tency every thing he has &s;aid and done during the cour&s;e of a political life ju&s;t touching to its clo&s;e. I believe that gentleman has kept him|&s;elf more clear of running into the fa&s;hion of wild vi&s;ionary theories, or of &s;eeking popularity through every means, than any man perhaps ever did in the &s;ame &s;ituation.</P>
<P>He was the fir&s;t man who, on the hu&s;tings, at a popular election, rejected the authority of in&s;truc|tions from con&s;tituents; or who, in any place, has argued &s;o fully again&s;t it. Perhaps the di&s;|credit into which that doctrine of compul&s;ive in|&s;tructions under our con&s;titution is &s;ince fallen, may be due, in a great degree, to his oppo&s;ing him&s;elf to it in that manner, and on that occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The reforms in repre&s;entation, and the bills for &s;hortening the duration of parliaments, he uniformly and &s;teadily oppo&s;ed for many years together, in contradiction to many of his be&s;t friends. The&s;e friends, however, in his better days, when they had more to hope from his &s;ervice and more to fear from his lo&s;s than now they have, never cho&s;e to find any incon&s;i&s;tency between his acts and ex|pre&s;&s;ions in favour of liberty, and his votes on tho&s;e que&s;tions. But there is a time for all things.</P>
<P>Again&s;t the opinion of many friends, even again&s;t the &s;olicitation of &s;ome of them, he oppo&s;ed tho&s;e of the church clergy, who had petitioned the Hou&s;e of Commons to be di&s;charged from the &s;ub&s;crip|tion. Although he &s;upported the di&s;&s;enters in their petition for the indulgence which he had refu&s;ed to the clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church, in this, as he was not guilty of it, &s;o he was not reproached with incon&s;i&s;tency. At the &s;ame time he promoted, and again&s;t the wi&s;h of &s;everal, the clau&s;e that gave the di&s;&s;enting teachers another &s;ub&s;cription in the
<PB N="34" REF="35">
place of that which was then taken away. Neither at that time was reproach of incon&s;i&s;tency brought again&s;t him. People could then di&s;tingui&s;h between a difference in conduct, under a variation of cir|cum&s;tances, and an incon&s;i&s;tency in principle. It was not then thought nece&s;&s;ary to be freed of him as of an incumbrance.</P>
<P>The&s;e in&s;tances, a few among many, are pro|duced as an an&s;wer to the in&s;inuation of his having pur&s;ued high popular cour&s;es, which in his late book he has abandoned. Perhaps in his whole life he has never omitted a fair occa&s;ion, with whatever ri&s;que to him of obloquy as an indivi|dual, with whatever detriment to his intere&s;t as a member of oppo&s;ition, to a&s;&s;ert the very &s;ame doc|trines which appear in that book. He told the Hou&s;e, upon an important occa&s;ion, and pretty early in his &s;ervice, <Q>that &startq;being warned by the ill effect of a contrary procedure in great examples, he had taken his ideas of liberty very low; in order that they &s;hould &s;tick to him, and that he might &s;tick to them to the end of his life.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>At popular elections the mo&s;t rigorous ca&s;ui&s;ts will remit a little of their &s;everity. They will allow to a candidate &s;ome unqualified effu&s;ions in favour of freedom, without binding him to adhere to them in their utmo&s;t extent. But Mr. Burke put a more &s;trict rule upon him&s;elf than mo&s;t morali&s;ts would put upon others. At his fir&s;t offering him&s;elf to Bri&s;tol, where he was almo&s;t &s;ure he &s;hould not obtain, on that or any oc|ca&s;ion, a &s;ingle Tory vote, (in fact he did obtain but one) and re&s;ted wholly on the Whig intere&s;t, he thought him&s;elf bound to tell to the electors, both before and after his election, exactly what a repre|&s;entative they had to expect in him.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;The <HI>di&s;tingui&s;hing</HI> part of our con&s;titution (he
<PB N="35" REF="36">
&s;aid) is its liberty. To pre&s;erve that liberty in|violate, is the <HI>peculiar</HI> duty and <HI>proper</HI> tru&s;t of a member of the hou&s;e of commons. But the li|berty, the <HI>only</HI> liberty I mean, is a liberty con|nected with <HI>order,</HI> and that not only exi&s;ts <HI>with</HI> order and virtue, but cannot exi&s;t at all <HI>without</HI> them. It inheres in good and &s;teady govern|ment, as in <HI>its &s;ub&s;tance and vital principle.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
<P>The liberty to which Mr. Burke declared him|&s;elf attached, is not French liberty. That liberty is nothing but the rein given to vice and confu&s;ion. Mr. Burke was then, as he was at the writing of his Reflections, awfully impre&s;&s;ed with the difficulties ari&s;ing from the complex &s;tate of our con&s;titution and our empire, and that it might require, in dif|ferent emergencies different &s;orts of exertions, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive call upon all the various principles which uphold and ju&s;tify it. This will appear from what he &s;aid at the clo&s;e of the poll.&mdash;</P>
<P><Q>&startq;To be a good member of parliament is, let me tell you, no ea&s;y ta&s;k; e&s;pecially at this time, when there is &s;o &s;trong a di&s;po&s;ition to run into the perilous extremes of <HI>&s;ervile</HI> compliance, <HI>or wild popularity.</HI> To unite circum&s;pection with vigour, is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary; but it is extreme|ly difficult. We are now members for a rich commercial <HI>city;</HI> this city, however, is but a part of a rich commercial <HI>nation,</HI> the intere&s;ts of which are <HI>various, multiform, and intricate.</HI> We are members for that great <HI>nation</HI> which, however, is it&s;elf but part of a great <HI>empire,</HI> extended by our virtue and our fortune to the farthe&s;t limits of the ea&s;t and of the we&s;t. <HI>All</HI> the&s;e wide-&s;pread intere&s;ts mu&s;t be <HI>con&s;idered;</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>compared;</HI> mu&s;t be <HI>reconciled,</HI> if po&s;&s;ible.

<PB N="36" REF="37">

We are members in a <HI>great and an|tient</HI> MONARCHY; <HI>and we mu&s;t pre&s;erve religiou&s;ly the true legal rights of the &s;overeign, which form the key-&s;tone that binds together the noble and well|con&s;tructed arch of our empire and our con&s;titution.</HI> A con&s;titution made up of <HI>balanced powers,</HI> mu&s;t ever be a critical thing. As &s;uch I mean to touch that part of it which comes within my reach.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>In this manner Mr. Burke &s;poke to his con&s;ti|tuents &s;eventeen years ago. He &s;poke, not like a partizan of one particular member of our con&s;ti|tution, but as a per&s;on &s;trongly, and on principle, attached to them all. He thought the&s;e great and e&s;&s;ential members ought to be pre&s;erved, and pre|&s;erved each in its place; and that the monarchy ought not only to be &s;ecured in its peculiar ex|i&s;tence, but in its pre-eminence too, as the pre&s;id|ing and connecting principle of the whole. Let it be con&s;idered, whether the language of his book, printed in 1790, differs from his &s;peech at Bri&s;tol in 1774.</P>
<P>With equal ju&s;tice his opinions on the American war are introduced, as if in his late work he had belied his conduct and opinions in the debates which aro&s;e upon that great event. On the Ameri|can war he never had any opinions which he has &s;een occa&s;ion to retract, or which he has ever retracted. He indeed differs e&s;&s;entially from Mr. Fox as to the cau&s;e of that war. Mr. Fox has been plea&s;ed to &s;ay, that the Americans rebelled, <Q>becau&s;e they thought they had not enjoyed liberty enough.</Q> This cau&s;e of the war <HI>from him</HI> I have heard of for the fir&s;t time. It is true that tho&s;e who &s;timulated the nation to that mea&s;ure, did frequently urge this topic. They contended, that the Americans had from the begin|ning aimed at independence; that from the begin|ning
<PB N="37" REF="38">
they meant wholly to throw off the authority of the crown, and to break their connection with the parent country. This Mr. Burke never believed. When he moved his &s;econd conciliatory propo&s;ition in the year 1776, he entered into the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of this point at very great length; and from nine &s;e|veral heads of pre&s;umption, endeavored to prove the charge upon that people not to be true.</P>
<P>If the principles of all he has &s;aid and wrote on the occa&s;ion, be viewed with common tem|per, the gentlemen of the party will perceive, that on a &s;uppo&s;ition that the Americans had re|belled merely in order to enlarge their liberty, Mr. Burke would have thought very differently of the American cau&s;e. What might have been in the &s;ecret thoughts of &s;ome of their leaders it is im|po&s;&s;ible to &s;ay. As far as a man, &s;o locked up as Dr. Franklin, could be expected to communicate his ideas, I believe he opened them to Mr. Burke. It was, I think, the very day before he &s;et out for Ame|rica, that a very long conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed between them, and with a greater air of openne&s;s on the Doc|tor's &s;ide, than Mr. Burke had ob&s;erved in him be|fore. In this di&s;cour&s;e Dr. Franklin lamented, and with apparent &s;incerity, the &s;eparation which he feared was inevitable between Great Britain and her colonies. He certainly &s;poke of it as an event which gave him the greate&s;t concern. America, he &s;aid, would never again &s;ee &s;uch happy days as &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed under the protection of England. He ob&s;erved, that ours was the only in&s;tance of a great empire, in which the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts and members had been as well governed as the metropolis and its vicinage: But that the Americans were going to lo&s;e the means which &s;ecured to them this rare and precious advan|tage. The que&s;tion with them was not whether they were to remain as they had been before the troubles, for better, he allowed they could not hope to be;
<PB N="38" REF="39">
but whether they were to give up &s;o happy a &s;itua|tion without a &s;truggle? Mr. Burke had &s;everal other conver&s;ations with him about that time, in none of which, &s;oured and exa&s;perated as his mind certainly was, did he di&s;cover any other wi&s;h in favour of America than for a &s;ecurity to its <HI>ancient</HI> condi|tion. Mr. Burke's conver&s;ation with other Ameri|cans was large indeed, and his enquiries exten&s;ive and diligent. Tru&s;ting to the re&s;ult of all the&s;e means of information, but tru&s;ting much more in the pub|lic pre&s;umptive indications I have ju&s;t referred to, and to the reiterated &s;olemn declarations of their a&s;&s;emblies, he always firmly believed that they were purely on the defen&s;ive in that rebellion. He con|&s;idered the Americans as &s;tanding at that time, and in that controver&s;y, in the &s;ame relation to Eng|land, as England did to king James the Second, in 1688. He believed, that they had taken up arms from one motive only; that is our attempting to tax them without their con&s;ent; to tax them for the purpo&s;es of maintaining civil and military e&s;tabli&s;hments. If this attempt of ours could have been practically e&s;tabli&s;hed, he thought with them, that their a&s;&s;emblies would become totally u&s;ele&s;s; that under the &s;y&s;tem of policy which was then pur&s;ued, the Americans could have no &s;ort of &s;e|curity for their laws or liberties, or for any part of them; and, that the very circum&s;tance of <HI>our</HI> free|dom would have augmented the weight of <HI>their</HI> &s;lavery.</P>
<P>Con&s;idering the Americans on that defen&s;ive foot|ing, he thought Great Britain ought in&s;tantly to have clo&s;ed with them by the repeal of the taxing act. He was of opinion that our general rights over that country would have been pre&s;erved by this timely conce&s;&s;ion <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See his &s;peech on American taxation, the 19th of April, 1774.</NOTE>. When, in&s;tead of this,

a Bo&s;ton port bill, a Ma&s;&s;achu&s;et's charter bill, a Fi&s;hery bill, an Intercour&s;e bill, I know not how many ho&s;tile bills ru&s;hed out like &s;o many tempe&s;ts from all points of the compa&s;s, and were accompanied fir&s;t with great fleets and ar|mies of Engli&s;h, and followed afterwards with great bodies of foreign troops, he thought that their cau&s;e grew daily better, becau&s;e daily more defen|&s;ive; and that ours, becau&s;e daily more offen&s;ive, grew daily wor&s;e. He therefore in two motions, in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive years, propo&s;ed in parliament many conce&s;&s;ions beyond what he had rea&s;on to think in the beginning of the troubles would ever be &s;eriou&s;ly demanded.</P>
<P>So circum&s;tanced, he certainly never could and never did wi&s;h the coloni&s;ts to be &s;ubdued by arms. He was fully per&s;uaded, that if &s;uch &s;hould be the event, they mu&s;t be held in that &s;ubdued &s;tate by a great body of &s;tanding forces, and per|haps of foreign forces. He was &s;trongly of opinion, that &s;uch armies, fir&s;t victorious over Engli&s;hmen, in a conflict for Engli&s;h con&s;titutional rights and privileges, and afterwards habituated (though in America) to keep an Engli&s;h people in a &s;tate of abject &s;ubjection, would prove fatal in the end to the liberties of England it&s;elf; that in the mean time this military &s;y&s;tem would lie as an oppre&s;&s;ive burthen upon the national finances; that it would con&s;tantly breed and feed new di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, full of heat and acrimony, leading po&s;&s;ibly to a new &s;eries of wars; and that foreign powers, whil&s;t we con|tinued in a &s;tate at once burthened and di&s;tracted, mu&s;t at length obtain a decided &s;uperiority over us. On what part of his late publication, or on what expre&s;&s;ion that might have e&s;caped him in that work, is any man authorized to charge Mr. Burke with a contradiction to the line of his conduct, and to the current of his doctrines on the American

war? The pamphlet is in the hands of his accu&s;ers, let them point out the pa&s;&s;age if they can.</P>
<P>Indeed, the author has been well &s;ifted and &s;cru|tinized by his friends. He is even called to an account for every jocular and light expre&s;&s;ion. A ludicrous picture which he made with regard to a pa&s;&s;age in the &s;peech of a <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Lord Lan&s;down.</NOTE> late mini&s;ter, has been brought up again&s;t him. That pa&s;&s;age con|tained a lamentation for the lo&s;s of monarchy to the Americans, after they had &s;eparated from Great Britain. He thought it to be un&s;ea&s;onable, ill judged, and ill &s;orted with the circum&s;tances of all the parties. Mr. Burke, it &s;eems, con&s;idered it ridiculous to lament the lo&s;s of &s;ome monarch or other, to a rebel people, at the moment they had for ever quitted their allegiance to theirs and our &s;overeign; at the time when they had broken off all connexion with this nation, and had allied them|&s;elves with its enemies. He certainly mu&s;t have thought it open to ridicule: and, now that it is recalled to his memory, (he had, I believe, whol|ly forgotten the circum&s;tance) he recollects that he did treat it with &s;ome levity. But is it a fair infe|rence from a je&s;t on this un&s;ea&s;onable lamentation, that he was then an enemy to monarchy either in this or in any other country? The contrary per|haps ought to be inferred, if any thing at all can be argued from plea&s;antries good or bad. Is it for this rea&s;on, or for any thing he has &s;aid or done re|lative to the American war, that he is to enter into an alliance offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive with every rebellion, in every country, under every circum|&s;tance, and rai&s;ed upon whatever pretence? Is it becau&s;e he did not wi&s;h the Americans to be &s;ub|dued by arms, that he mu&s;t be incon&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf, if he reprobates the conduct of tho&s;e &s;o|cieties

Is he obliged, from the conce&s;&s;ions he wi&s;hed to be made to the colonies, to keep any terms with tho&s;e clubs and federations, who hold out to us as a pattern for imitation, the proceedings in France, in which a king, who had voluntarily and formally di|ve&s;ted him&s;elf of the right of taxation, and of all other &s;pecies of arbitrary power, has been dethroned?&mdash;Is it becau&s;e Mr. Burke wi&s;hed to have America rather conciliated than vanqui&s;hed, that he mu&s;t wi&s;h well to the army of republics which are &s;et up in France; a country wherein not the people, but the mo|narch was wholly on the defen&s;ive (a poor, indeed, and feeble defen&s;ive) to pre&s;erve <HI>&s;ome fragments</HI> of the royal authority again&s;t a determined and de&s;perate body of con&s;pirators, who&s;e object it was, with whatever certainty of crimes, with whatever hazard of war and every other &s;pecies of calamity, to anni|hilate the <HI>whole</HI> of that authority; to level all ranks, orders, and di&s;tinctions in the &s;tate; and utterly to de&s;troy property, not more by their acts than in their principles?</P>
<P>Mr. Burke has been al&s;o reproached with an in|con&s;i&s;tency between his late writings and his former conduct, becau&s;e he had propo&s;ed in parliament &s;everal oeconomical, leading to &s;everal con&s;titutional reforms. Mr. Burke thought, with a majority of the Hou&s;e of Commons, that the influence of the crown at one time was too great; but after his Ma|je&s;ty had by a gracious me&s;&s;age, and &s;everal &s;ub&s;e|quent acts of parliament, reduced it to a &s;tandard which &s;atisfied Mr. Fox him&s;elf, and, apparently at lea&s;t, contented whoever wi&s;hed to go farthe&s;t in that reduction, is Mr. Burke to allow that it would be right

for us to proceed to indefinite lengths upon that &s;ub|ject? that it would therefore be ju&s;tifiable in a people owing allegiance to a monarchy, and profe&s;&s;ing to maintain it, not to <HI>reduce,</HI> but wholly to <HI>take away all</HI> prerogative, and <HI>all</HI> influence what&s;oever?&mdash;Mu&s;t his having made, in virtue of a plan of oeconomical re|gulation, a reduction of the influence of the crown, that it would be right in the French or in us to bring a king to &s;o abject a &s;tate, as in function not to be &s;o re&s;pectable as an under &s;heriff, but in per|&s;on not to differ from the condition of a mere pri|&s;oner? One would think that &s;uch a thing as a me|dium had never been heard of in the moral world.</P>
<P>This mode of arguing from your having done <HI>any</HI> thing in a certain line, to the nece&s;&s;ity of do|ing <HI>every</HI> thing, has political con&s;equences of other moment than tho&s;e of a logical fallacy. If no man can propo&s;e any diminution or modification of an invidious or dangerous power or influence in go|vernment, without entitling friends turned into adver&s;aries, to argue him into the de&s;truction of all prerogative, and to a &s;poliation of the whole patronage of royalty, I do not know what can more effectually deter per&s;ons of &s;ober minds from engaging in any reform; nor how the wor&s;t enemies to the liberty of the &s;ubject could contrive any method more fit to bring all correc|tives on the power of the crown into &s;u&s;picion and di&s;repute.</P>
<P>If, &s;ay his accu&s;ers, the dread of too great influence in the crown of Great Britain could ju&s;tify the degree of reform which he adopted, the dread of a return under the de&s;poti&s;m of a monarchy might ju&s;tify the people of France in going much further, and reduc|ing monarchy to its pre&s;ent nothing. Mr. Burke does not allow, that a &s;ufficient argument <HI>ad hominem</HI> is inferable from tho&s;e premi&s;es. If the horror of the exce&s;&s;es of an ab&s;olute monarchy furni&s;hes a rea&s;on for
<PB N="43" REF="44">
aboli&s;hing it, no monarchy once ab&s;olute (all have been &s;o at one period or other) could ever be limited. It mu&s;t be de&s;troyed; otherwi&s;e no way could be found to quiet the fears of tho&s;e who were formerly &s;ub|jected to that &s;way. But the principle of Mr. Burke's proceeding ought to lead him to a very different conclu&s;ion;&mdash;to this conclu&s;ion,&mdash;that a monar|chy is a thing perfectly &s;u&s;ceptible of reform; per|fectly &s;u&s;ceptible of a balance of power; and that, when reformed and balanced, for a great country, it is the be&s;t of all governments. The example of our country might have led France, as it has led him, to perceive that monarchy is not only reconcila|ble to liberty, but that it may be rendered a great and &s;table &s;ecurity to its perpetual enjoyment. No correctives which he propo&s;ed to the power of the crown could lead him to approve of a plan of a republic (if &s;o it may be reputed) which has no correctives, and which he believes to be inca|pable of admitting any. No principle of Mr. Burke's conduct or writings obliged him, from con&s;i&s;tency, to become an advocate for an ex|change of mi&s;chiefs; no principle of his could compel him to ju&s;tify the &s;etting up in the place of a mitigated monarchy, a new and far more de&s;potic power, under which there is no trace of liberty, except what appears in confu&s;ion and in crime.</P>
<P>Mr. Burke does not admit that the faction pre|dominant in France have aboli&s;hed their monarchy and the orders of their &s;tate, from any dread of arbi|trary power that lay heavy on the minds of the peo|ple. It is not very long &s;ince he has been in that country. Whil&s;t there he conver&s;ed with many de|&s;criptions of its inhabitants. A few per&s;ons of rank did, he allows, di&s;cover &s;trong and manife&s;t tokens of &s;uch a &s;pirit of liberty, as might be expected one day to break all bounds. Such gentlemen have
<PB N="44" REF="45">
&s;ince had more rea&s;on to repent of their want of fore&s;ight than I hope any of the &s;ame cla&s;s will ever have in this country. But this &s;pirit was far from general even among&s;t the gentlemen. As to the lower orders and tho&s;e a little above them, in who&s;e name the pre&s;ent powers domineer, they were far from di&s;covering any &s;ort of di&s;&s;atisfaction with the power and prerogatives of the crown. That vain people were rather proud of them: they rather de&s;pi&s;ed the Engli&s;h for not having a mo|narch po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch high and perfect authority. <HI>They</HI> had felt nothing from <HI>Lettres de Cachet.</HI> The Ba&s;tile could in&s;pire no horrors into <HI>them.</HI> This was a treat for their betters. It was by art and impul&s;e; it was by the &s;ini&s;ter u&s;e made of a &s;ea|&s;on of &s;carcity; it was under an infinitely diver&s;ified &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of wicked pretences, wholly foreign to the que&s;tion of monarchy or ari&s;tocracy, that this light people were in&s;pired with their pre&s;ent &s;pirit of levelling. Their old vanity was led by art to take another turn: It was dazzled and &s;educed by mi|litary liveries, cockades, and epaulets, until the French populace was led to become the willing, but &s;till the proud and thoughtle&s;s in&s;trument and victim of another tyranny. Neither did that peo|ple de&s;pi&s;e, or hate, or fear their nobility. On the contrary, they valued them&s;elves on the generous qualities which di&s;tingui&s;hed the chiefs of their na|tion.</P>
<P>So far as to the attack on Mr. Burke, in con&s;e|quence of his reforms.</P>
<P>To &s;hew that he has in his la&s;t publication abandoned tho&s;e principles of liberty which have given energy to his youth, and in &s;pite of his cen&s;ors will afford repo&s;e and con&s;olation to his declining age, tho&s;e who have thought proper in parliament to declare again&s;t his book, ought to have produced &s;omething in it, which di|rectly
<PB N="45" REF="46">
or indirectly militates with any rational plan of free government. It is &s;omething extraordinary, that they who&s;e memories have &s;o well &s;erved them with regard to light and ludicrous expre&s;&s;ions which years had con&s;igned to oblivion, &s;hould not have been able to quote a &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age in a piece &s;o lately publi&s;hed, which contradicts any thing he has formerly ever &s;aid in a &s;tyle either ludicrous or &s;erious. They quote his former &s;peeches, and his former votes, but not one &s;yllable from the book. It is only by a collation of the one with the other that the alledged incon&s;i&s;tency can be e&s;tabli&s;hed. But as they are unable to cite any &s;uch contradictory pa&s;&s;age, &s;o neither can they &s;hew any thing in the general tendency and &s;pirit of the whole work un|favourable to a rational and generous &s;pirit of li|berty; unle&s;s a warm oppo&s;ition to the &s;pirit of levelling, to the &s;pirit of impiety, to the &s;pirit of pro&s;cription, plunder, murder, and cannibali&s;m, be adver&s;e to the true principles of freedom.</P>
<P>The author of that book is &s;uppo&s;ed to have pa&s;&s;ed from extreme to extreme; but he has always kept him&s;elf in a medium. This charge is not &s;o wonderful. It is in the nature of things, that they who are in the centre of a circle &s;hould appear directly oppo&s;ed to tho&s;e who view them from any part of the circumference. In that middle point, however, he will &s;till remain, though he may hear people who them&s;elves run beyond Aurora and the Ganges, cry out, that he is at the extremity of the we&s;t.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame debate Mr. Burke was repre&s;ented as arguing in a manner which implied that the Bri|ti&s;h con&s;titution could not be defended, but by abu|&s;ing all republics antient and modern. He &s;aid no|thing to give the lea&s;t ground for &s;uch a cen&s;ure. He never abu&s;ed all republics. He has never pro|fe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a friend or an enemy to republics or
<PB N="46" REF="47">
to monarchies in the ab&s;tract. He thought that the circum&s;tances and habits of every country, which it is always perilous and productive of the greate&s;t cala|mities to force, are to decide upon the form of its government. There is nothing in his nature, his temper, or his faculties, which &s;hould make him an enemy to any republic modern or antient. Far from it. He has &s;tudied the form and &s;pirit of republics very early in life; he has &s;tudied them with great attention; and with a mind undi&s;turbed by affection or prejudice. He is indeed convinced that the &s;ci|ence of government would be poorly cultivated without that &s;tudy. But the re&s;ult in his mind from that inve&s;tigation has been, and is, that neither England nor France, without infinite detriment to them, as well in the event as in the experiment, could be brought into a republican form; but that every thing republican which can be introduced with &s;afety into either of them, mu&s;t be built upon a monarchy; built upon a real, not a nominal mo|narchy, <HI>as its e&s;&s;ential ba&s;is;</HI> that all &s;uch in&s;titu|tions, whether ari&s;tocratic or democratic, mu&s;t ori|ginate from their crown, and in all their proceed|ings mu&s;t refer to it; that by the energy of that main &s;pring alone tho&s;e republican parts mu&s;t be &s;et in ac|tion, and from thence mu&s;t derive their whole le|gal effect, (as among&s;t us they actually do) or the whole will fall into confu&s;ion. The&s;e republican members have no other point but the crown in which they can po&s;&s;ibly unite.</P>
<P>This is the opinion expre&s;&s;ed in Mr. Burke's book. He has never varied in that opinion &s;ince he came to years of di&s;cretion. But &s;urely, if at any time of his life he had entertained other no|tions, (which however he has never held or profe&s;&s;ed to hold) the horrible calamities brought upon a great people, by the wild attempt to force their country into a republick, might be more than &s;ufficient to
<PB N="47" REF="48">
undeceive his under&s;tanding, and to free it for ever from &s;uch de&s;tructive fancies. He is certain, that many, even in France, have been made &s;ick of their theories by their very &s;ucce&s;s in realizing them.</P>
<P>To fortify the imputation of a de&s;ertion from his principles, his con&s;tant attempts to reform abu&s;es, have been brought forward. It is true, it has been the bu&s;ine&s;s of his &s;trength to reform abu&s;es in government; and his la&s;t feeble efforts are em|ployed in a &s;truggle again&s;t them. Politically he has lived in that element; politically he will die in it. Before he departs, I will admit for him that he de&s;erves to have all his titles of merit brought forth, as they have been, for grounds of con|demnation, if one word, ju&s;tifying or &s;upporting abu&s;es of any &s;ort, is to be found in that book which has kindled &s;o much indignation in the mind of a great man. On the contrary, it &s;pares no exi&s;ting abu&s;e. Its very purpo&s;e is to make war with abu&s;es; not, indeed, to make war with the dead, but with tho&s;e which live, and flouri&s;h, and reign.</P>
<P>The <HI>purpo&s;e</HI> for which the abu&s;es of govern|ment are brought into view, forms a very ma|terial con&s;ideration in the mode of treating them. The complaints of a friend are things very differ|ent from the invectives of an enemy. The charge of abu&s;es on the late monarchy of France, was not intended to lead to its reformation, but to ju&s;tify its de&s;truction. They who have raked into all hi&s;tory for the faults of kings, and who have ag|gravated every fault they have found, have acted con&s;i&s;tently; becau&s;e they acted as enemies. No man can be a friend to a tempered monarchy who bears a decided hatred to monarchy it&s;elf. He who, at the pre&s;ent time, is favourable, or even fair to that &s;y&s;tem, mu&s;t act towards it as towards a friend with frailties, who is under the pro&s;ecution
<PB N="48" REF="49">
of implacable foes. I think it a duty in that ca&s;e, not to inflame the public mind again&s;t the obnoxi|ous per&s;on, by any exaggeration of his faults. It is our duty rather to palliate his errors and defects, or to ca&s;t them in the &s;hade, and indu&s;triou&s;ly to bring forward any good qualities that he may hap|pen to po&s;&s;e&s;s. But when the man is to be amend|ed, and by amendment to be pre&s;erved, then the line of duty takes another direction. When his &s;afety is effectually provided for, it then becomes the office of a friend to urge his faults and vices with all the energy of enlightened affection, to paint them in their mo&s;t vivid colours, and to bring the moral patient to a better habit. Thus I think with regard to individuals; thus I think with regard to antient and re&s;pected governments and orders of men. A &s;pirit of reformation is never more con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, than when it refu&s;es to be rendered the means of de&s;truction.</P>
<P>I &s;uppo&s;e that enough is &s;aid upon the&s;e heads of accu&s;ation. One more I had nearly forgotten, but I &s;hall &s;oon di&s;patch it. The author of the Re|flections, in the opening of the la&s;t parliament, en|tered on the Journals of the Hou&s;e of Commons a motion for a remon&s;trance to the crown, which is &s;ub&s;tantially a defence of the preceding parlia|ment, that had been di&s;&s;olved under di&s;plea&s;ure. It is a defence of Mr. Fox. It is a defence of the Whigs. By what connection of argument, by what a&s;&s;ociation of ideas, this apology for Mr. Fox and his party is, by him and them, brought to cri|minate his and their apologi&s;t, I cannot ea&s;ily di|vine. It is true, that Mr. Burke received no previous encouragement from Mr. Fox, nor any the lea&s;t countenance or &s;upport at the time when the motion was made, from him or from any gentleman of the party, one only excepted, from who&s;e friend&s;hip, on that and on other occa&s;ions, he derives an honour
<PB N="49" REF="50">
to which he mu&s;t be dull indeed to be in&s;en&s;ible. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Mr. Windham.</NOTE> If that remon&s;trance therefore was a fal&s;e or feeble defence of the mea&s;ures of the party, they were in no wi&s;e affected by it. It &s;tands on the Journals. This &s;ecures to it a permanence which the author cannot expect to any other work of his. Let it &s;peak for it&s;elf to the pre&s;ent age, and to all po&s;te|rity. The party had no concern in it; and it can never be quoted again&s;t them. But in the late debate it was produced, not to clear the party from an im|proper defence in which they had no &s;hare, but for the kind purpo&s;e of in&s;inuating an incon&s;i&s;tency be|tween the principles of Mr. Burke's defence of the di&s;&s;olved parliament, and tho&s;e on which he pro|ceeded in his late Reflections on France.</P>
<P>It requires great ingenuity to make out &s;uch a parallel between the two ca&s;es, as to found a charge of incon&s;i&s;tency in the principles a&s;&s;umed in arguing the one and the other. What relation had Mr. Fox's India bill to the con&s;titution of France? What relation had that con&s;titution to the que&s;tion of right, in an hou&s;e of commons, to give or to withhold its confidence from mini&s;ters, and to &s;tate that opinion to the crown? What had this di&s;cu&s;|&s;ion to do with Mr. Burke's idea in 1784, of the ill con&s;equences which mu&s;t in the end ari&s;e to the crown from &s;etting up the commons at large as an oppo&s;ite intere&s;t to the commons in parliament? What has this di&s;cu&s;&s;ion to do with a recorded warning to the people, of their ra&s;hly forming a precipitate judgment again&s;t their repre&s;entatives? What had Mr. Burke's opinion of the danger of in|troducing new theoretic language unknown to the records of the kingdom, and calculated to excite vexatious que&s;tions, into a parliamentary proceed|ing,
<PB N="50" REF="51">
to do with the French a&s;&s;embly, which defies all precedent, and places its whole glory in realizing what had been thought the mo&s;t vi&s;ionary theories? What had this in common with the abolition of the French monarchy, or with the principles upon which the Engli&s;h revolution was ju&s;tified? a revolution in which parliament, in all its acts and all its decla|rations, religiou&s;ly adheres to 'the form of &s;ound words,' without excluding from private di&s;cu&s;&s;ions, &s;uch terms of art as may &s;erve to conduct an inquiry for which none but private per&s;ons are re&s;pon&s;ible? The&s;e were the topics of Mr. Burke's propo&s;ed re|mon&s;trance; all of which topics &s;uppo&s;e the exi&s;t|ence and mutual relation of our three e&s;tates; as well as the relation of the Ea&s;t India Company to the crown, to parliament, and to the peculiar laws, rights, and u&s;ages of the people of Hindo&s;tan? What reference, I &s;ay, had the&s;e topics to the con&s;titution of France, in which there is no king, no lords, no commons, no India company to injure or &s;up|port, no Indian empire to govern or oppre&s;s? What relation had all or any of the&s;e, or any que&s;tion which could ari&s;e between the prerogatives of the crown and the privileges of parliament, with the cen&s;ure of tho&s;e factious per&s;ons in Great Britain, whom Mr. Burke &s;tated to be engaged, not in favour of privilege again&s;t prerogative, or of pre|rogative again&s;t privilege, but in an open attempt again&s;t our crown and our parliament; again&s;t our con&s;titution in church and &s;tate; again&s;t all the parts and orders which compo&s;e the one and the other?</P>
<P>No per&s;ons were more fiercely active again&s;t Mr. Fox, and again&s;t the mea&s;ures of the hou&s;e of commons di&s;&s;olved in 1784, which Mr. Burke de|fends in that remon&s;trance, than &s;everal of tho&s;e re|volution-makers, whom Mr. Burke condemns alike
<PB N="51" REF="52">
in his remon&s;trance, and in his book. The&s;e revo|lutioni&s;ts indeed may be well thought to vary in their conduct. He is, however, far from accu&s;ing them, in this variation, of the &s;malle&s;t degree of incon&s;i&s;t|ency. He is per&s;uaded, that they are totally indif|ferent at which end they begin the demolition of the con&s;titution.&mdash;Some are for commencing their ope|rations with the de&s;truction of the civil powers, in order the better to pull down the eccle&s;ia&s;tical; &s;ome wi&s;h to begin with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical, in order to facilitate the ruin of the civil; &s;ome would de|&s;troy the hou&s;e of commons through the crown; &s;ome the crown through the hou&s;e of commons; and &s;ome would overturn both the one and the other through what they call the people. But I believe that this injured writer will think it not at all in|con&s;i&s;tent with his pre&s;ent duty, or with his former life, &s;trenuou&s;ly to oppo&s;e all the various partizans of de&s;truction, let them begin where, or when, or how they will. No man would &s;et his face more determinedly again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;hould attempt to deprive them, or any de&s;cription of men, of the rights they po&s;&s;e&s;s. No man would be more &s;teady in preventing them from abu&s;ing tho&s;e rights to the de&s;truction of that happy order under which they enjoy them. As to their title to any thing further, it ought to be grounded on the proof they give of the &s;afety with which power may be tru&s;ted in their hands. When they attempt without di&s;gui&s;e, not to win it from our affections, but to force it from our fears, they &s;hew, in the character of their means of obtaining it, the u&s;e they would make of their do|minion. That writer is too well read in men, not to know how often the de&s;ire and de&s;ign of a tyrannic domination lurks in the claim of an extravagant liberty. Perhaps in the beginning it <HI>always</HI> di&s;plays it&s;elf in that manner. No man has ever affected
<PB N="52" REF="53">
power which he did not hope from the favour of the exi&s;ting government, in any other mode.</P>
<P>The attacks on the author's con&s;i&s;tency relative to France, are (however grievous they may be to his feelings) in a great degree external to him and to us, and comparatively of little moment to the people of England. The &s;ub&s;tantial charge upon him is concerning his doctrines relative to the Revolution of 1688. Here it is, that they who &s;peak in the name of the party have thought proper to cen|&s;ure him the mo&s;t loudly, and with the greate&s;t a&s;perity. Here they fa&s;ten; and, if they are right in their fact, with &s;ufficient judgment in their &s;elec|tion. If he be guilty in this point he is equally blameable, whether he is con&s;i&s;tent or not. If he endeavours to delude his countrymen by a fal&s;e re|pre&s;entation of the &s;pirit of that leading event, and of the true nature and tenure of the government formed in con&s;equence of it, he is deeply re&s;pon|&s;ible; he is an enemy to the free con&s;titution of the kingdom. But he is not guilty in any &s;en&s;e. I maintain that in his Reflections he has &s;tated the Revolution and the &s;ettlement upon their true prin|ciples of legal rea&s;on and con&s;titutional policy.</P>
<P>His authorities are the acts and declarations of parliament given in their proper words. So far as the&s;e go, nothing can be added to what he has quoted. The que&s;tion is, whether he has under|&s;tood them rightly. I think they &s;peak plain enough. But we mu&s;t &s;ee whether he proceeds with other authority than his own con&s;tructions; and if he does, on what &s;ort of authority he proceeds. In this part, his defence will not be made by argument, but by wager of law. He takes his compurgators, his vouchers, his guarantees, along with him. I know, that he will not be &s;atisfied with a ju&s;tification proceeding on general rea&s;ons of policy. He mu&s;t
<PB N="53" REF="54">
be defended on party grounds too; or his cau&s;e is not &s;o tenable as I wi&s;h it to appear. It mu&s;t be made out for him, not only, that in his con&s;truction of the&s;e public acts and monuments he conforms him|&s;elf to the rules of fair, legal, and logical interpre|tation; but it mu&s;t be proved that his con&s;truc|tion is in perfect harmony with that of the ancient Whigs, to whom, again&s;t the &s;entence of the mo|dern, on his part, I here appeal.</P>
<P>This July, it will be twenty-&s;ix years <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">July 17th 1765.</NOTE> &s;ince he became connected with a man who&s;e memory will ever be precious to Engli&s;hmen of all parties, as long as the ideas of honour and virtue, public and private, are under&s;tood and cheri&s;hed in this nation. That memory will be kept alive with par|ticular veneration by all rational and honourable Whigs. Mr. Burke entered into a connexion with that party, through that man, at an age, far from raw and immature; at tho&s;e years when men are all they are ever likely to become; when he was in the prime and vigour of his life; when the powers of his under&s;tanding, according to their &s;tandard, were at the be&s;t; his memory exerci&s;ed; his judg|ment formed; and his reading, much fre&s;her in the recollection, and much readier in the application, than now it is. He was at that time as likely as mo&s;t men to know what were Whig and what were Tory principles. He was in a &s;ituation to di&s;cern what &s;ort of Whig principles they enter|tained, with whom it was his wi&s;h to form an eter|nal connexion. Fooli&s;h he would have been at that time of life (more fooli&s;h than any man who undertakes a public tru&s;t would be thought) to ad|here to a cau&s;e, which he, among&s;t all tho&s;e who were engaged in it, had the lea&s;t &s;anguine hopes of, as a road to power.</P>
<P><PB N="54" REF="55">
There are who remember, that on the removal of the Whigs in the year 1766, he was as free to choo&s;e another connexion as any man in the king|dom. To put him&s;elf out of the way of the nego|ciations which were then carrying on very eagerly, and through many channels, with the Earl of Chat|ham, he went to Ireland very &s;oon after the change of mini&s;try, and did not return until the meeting of parliament. He was at that time free from any thing which looked like an engagement. He was further free at the de&s;ire of his friends; for the very day of his return, the Marquis of Rockingham wi&s;hed him to accept an employment under the new &s;y&s;tem. He believes he might have had &s;uch a &s;ituation; but again he cheerfully took his fate with the party.</P>
<P>It would be a &s;erious imputation upon the pru|dence of my friend, to have made even &s;uch trivial &s;acrifices as it was in his power to make, for prin|ciples which he did not truly embrace, or did not perfectly under&s;tand. In either ca&s;e the folly would have been great. The que&s;tion now is, whether, when he fir&s;t practically profe&s;&s;ed Whig principles, he under&s;tood what principles he profe&s;&s;ed; and whether, in his book, he has faithfully expre&s;&s;ed them.</P>
<P>When he entered into the Whig party, he did not conceive that they pretended to any di&s;coveries. They did not affect to be better Whigs, than tho&s;e were who lived in the days in which principle was put to the te&s;t. Some of the Whigs of tho&s;e days were then living. They were what the Whigs had been at the Revolution; what they had been during the reign of queen Anne; what they had been at the acce&s;&s;ion of the pre&s;ent royal family.</P>
<P>What they were at tho&s;e periods is to be &s;een. It rarely happens to a party to have the opportunity of a
<PB N="55" REF="56">
clear, authentic, recorded, declaration of their poli|tical tenets upon the &s;ubject of a great con&s;titutional event like that of the Revolution. The Whigs had that opportunity, or, to &s;peak more properly, they made it. The impeachment of Dr. Sacheverel was undertaken by a Whig Mini&s;try and a Whig Hou&s;e of Commons, and carried on before a preva|lent and &s;teady majority of Whig Peers. It was carried on for the expre&s;s purpo&s;e of &s;tating the true grounds and principles of the Revolution; what the Commons emphatically called their <HI>foundation.</HI> It was carried on for the purpo&s;e of condemning the principles on which the Revolution was fir&s;t op|po&s;ed, and afterwards calumniated, in order by a juridical &s;entence of the highe&s;t authority to con|firm and fix Whig principles, as they had operated both in the re&s;i&s;tance to King James, and in the &s;ub&s;equent &s;ettlement; and to fix them in the ex|tent and with the limitations with which it was meant they &s;hould be under&s;tood by po&s;terity. The mini&s;ters and managers for the Commons were per|&s;ons who had, many of them, an active &s;hare in the Revolution. Mo&s;t of them had &s;een it at an age capable of reflection. The grand event, and all the di&s;cu&s;&s;ions which led to it, and followed it, were then alive in the memory and conver&s;ation of all men. The managers for the Commons mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;poken on that &s;ubject the pre|valent ideas of the leading party in the Commons, and of the Whig mini&s;try. Undoubtedly they &s;poke al&s;o their own private opinions; and the private opinions of &s;uch men are not without weight. They were not <HI>umbratiles doctores,</HI> men who had &s;tudied a free con&s;titution only in its anatomy, and upon dead &s;y&s;tems. They knew it alive and in action.</P>
<P>In this proceeding, the Whig principles, as ap|plied to the Revolution and &s;ettlement, are to be
<PB N="56" REF="57">
found, or they are to be found no where. I wi&s;h the Whig readers of this appeal fir&s;t to turn to Mr. Burke's Reflections from p. 20 to p. 50; and then to attend to the following extracts from the trial of Dr. Sacheverel. After this, they will con&s;ider two things; fir&s;t, whether the doctrine in Mr. Burke's Reflections be con&s;onant to that of the Whigs of that period; and &s;econdly, whether they choo&s;e to abandon the principles which belong|ed to the progenitors of &s;ome of them, and to the predece&s;&s;ors of them all, and to learn new principles of Whiggi&s;m, imported from France, and di&s;&s;emi|nated in this country from di&s;&s;enting pulpits, from federation &s;ocieties, and from the pamphlets, which (as containing the political creed of tho&s;e &s;ynods) are in|du&s;triou&s;ly circulated in all parts of the two king|doms. This is their affair, and they will make their option.</P>
<P>The&s;e new Whigs hold, that the &s;overeignty, whether exerci&s;ed by one or many, did not only ori|ginate <HI>from</HI> the people (a po&s;ition not denied, nor worth denying or a&s;&s;enting to) but that, in the people the &s;ame &s;overeignty con&s;tantly and unalien|ably re&s;ides; that the people may lawfully depo&s;e kings, not only for mi&s;conduct, but without any mi&s;|conduct at all; that they may &s;et up any new fa&s;hion of government for them&s;elves, or continue without any government at their plea&s;ure; that the people are e&s;&s;entially their own rule, and their will the mea&s;ure of their conduct; that the tenure of ma|gi&s;tracy is not a proper &s;ubject of contract; becau&s;e magi&s;trates have duties, but no rights: and that if a contract <HI>de &s;acto</HI> is made with them in one age, allowing that it binds at all, it only binds tho&s;e who were immediately concerned in it, but does not pa&s;s to po&s;terity. The&s;e doctrines concerning the <HI>people</HI> (a term which they are far from accurately defining, but by which, from many circum&s;tances, it is plain
<PB N="57" REF="58">
enough they mean their own faction, if they &s;hould grow by early arming, by treachery, or violence, into the prevailing force) tend, in my opinion, to the utter &s;ubver&s;ion, not only of all government, in all modes, and to all &s;table &s;ecurities to rational freedom, but to all the rules and principles of morality it&s;elf.</P>
<P>I a&s;&s;ert, that the ancient Whigs held doctrines, totally different from tho&s;e I have la&s;t mentioned. I a&s;&s;ert, that the foundations laid down by the Com|mons, on the trial of Doctor Sacheverel, for ju&s;ti|fying the revolution of 1688, are the very &s;ame laid down in Mr. Burke's Reflections; that is to &s;ay,&mdash;a breach of the <HI>original contract,</HI> implied and expre&s;&s;ed in the con&s;titution of this country, as a &s;cheme of government fundamentally and invio|lably fixed in King, Lords,. and Commons.&mdash;That the fundamental &s;ubver&s;ion of this antient con&s;titu|tion, by one of its parts, having been attempted, and in effect accompli&s;hed, ju&s;tified the Revolu|tion. That it was ju&s;tified <HI>only</HI> upon the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> of the ca&s;e; as the <HI>only</HI> means left for the reco|very of that <HI>antient</HI> con&s;titution, formed by the <HI>ori|ginal contract</HI> of the Briti&s;h &s;tate; as well as for the future pre&s;ervation of the <HI>&s;ame</HI> government. The&s;e are the points to be proved.</P>
<P>A general opening to the charge again&s;t Dr. Sache|verel was made by the Attorney General, Sir John Montagu; but as there is nothing in that opening &s;peech which tends very accurately to &s;ettle the prin|ciple upon which the Whigs proceeded in the pro|&s;ecution (the plan of the &s;peech not requiring it) I proceed to that of Mr. Lechmere, the manager who &s;poke next after him. The following are ex|tracts, given not in the exact order in which they &s;tand in the printed trial, but in that which is thought mo&s;t fit to bring the ideas of the Whig Commons di&s;tinctly under our view.</P>

<P>Mr. Walpole (afterwards Sir Robert) was one of the managers on this occa&s;ion. He was an honourable man and a &s;ound Whig. He was not, as the Jacobites and di&s;contented Whigs of his time have repre&s;ented him, and as ill-informed people &s;till repre&s;ent him, a prodigal and corrupt mini&s;ter. They charged him in their libels and &s;editious conver&s;a|tions as having fir&s;t reduced corruption to a &s;y&s;tem. Such was their cant. But he was far from governing by corruption. He governed by party attachments. The charge of &s;y&s;tematic corruption is le&s;s appli|cable to him, perhaps, than to any mini&s;ter who ever &s;erved the crown for &s;o great a length of
<PB N="64" REF="65">
time. He gained over very few from the Oppo|&s;ition. Without being a genius of the fir&s;t cla&s;s, he was an intelligent, prudent, and &s;afe mini&s;ter. He loved peace; and he helped to commu|nicate the &s;ame di&s;po&s;ition to nations at lea&s;t as warlike and re&s;tle&s;s as that in which he had the chief direction of affairs. Though he &s;erved a ma&s;ter who was fond of martial fame, he kept all the e&s;tabli&s;hments very low. The land tax continued at two &s;hillings in the pound for the greater part of his admini&s;tration. The other impo&s;itions were moderate. The profound re|po&s;e, the equal liberty, the firm protection of ju&s;t laws during the long period of his power, were the principal cau&s;es of that pro&s;perity which afterwards took &s;uch rapid &s;trides towards per|fection; and which furni&s;hed to this nation abi|lity to acquire the military glory which it has &s;ince obtained, as well as to bear the burthens, the cau&s;e and con&s;equence of that warlike reputation. With many virtues, public and private, he had his faults; but his faults were &s;uperficial. A carele&s;s, coar&s;e, and over familiar &s;tyle of di&s;cour&s;e, without &s;ufficient regard to per&s;ons or occa&s;ions, and an almo&s;t total want of political decorum, were the errours by which he was mo&s;t hurt in the public opinion: and tho&s;e through which his enemies obtained the greate&s;t advantage over him. But ju&s;tice mu&s;t be done. The prudence, &s;teadine&s;s, and vigilance of that man, joined to the greate&s;t po&s;&s;ible lenity in his character and his politics, pre&s;erved the crown to this royal family; and with it, their laws and li|berties to this country. Walpole had no other plan of defence for the Revolution, than that of the other managers, and of Mr. Burke; and he gives full as little countenance to any arbitrary at|tempts, on the part of re&s;tle&s;s and factious men, for framing new governments according to their fancies.</P>

<P><Q>&startq;But to return to the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions; I mu&s;t ap|peal to your lord&s;hips, whether they are not a <HI>total departure</HI> from the Doctor's an&s;wer.&endq;</Q></P>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>I now proceed to &s;hew that the Whig managers for the Commons meant to pre&s;erve the government on a firm foundation, by a&s;&s;erting the perpetual vali|dity of the &s;ettlement then made, and its coercive power upon po&s;terity. I mean to &s;hew that they gave no &s;ort of countenance to any doctrine tending to impre&s;s the <HI>people,</HI> taken &s;eparately from the legi&s;|lature which includes the crown, with an idea that <HI>they</HI> had acquired a moral or civil competence to alter (without breach of the original compact on the part of the king) the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown, at their plea&s;ure; much le&s;s that they had acquired any right, in the ca&s;e of &s;uch an event as cau&s;ed the Revolution, to &s;et up any new form of govern|ment. The author of the Reflections, I believe, thought that no man of common under&s;tanding could oppo&s;e to this doctrine, the ordinary &s;ove|reign power, as declared in the act of queen Anne. That is, that the kings or queens of the realm,
<PB N="69" REF="70">
with the con&s;ent of parliament, are competent to regulate and to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown. This power is and ever was inherent in the &s;upreme &s;overeignty; and was not, as the political divines vainly talk, acquired by the revolution. It is de|clared in the old &s;tatute of Queen Elizabeth. Such a power mu&s;t re&s;ide in the complete &s;overeignty of every kingdom; and it is in fact exerci&s;ed in all of them. But this right of <HI>competence</HI> in the legi&s;lature, not in the people, is by the legi&s;lature it&s;elf to be exer|ci&s;ed with <HI>&s;ound di&s;cretion;</HI> that is to &s;ay, it is to be exerci&s;ed or not, in conformity to the fundamental principles of this government; to the rules of moral obligation; and to the faith of pacts, either con|tained in the nature of the tran&s;action, or entered into by the body corporate of the kingdom; which body, in juridical con&s;truction, never dies; and in fact never lo&s;es its members at once by death.</P>
<P>Whether this doctrine is reconcileable to the modern philo&s;ophy of government, I believe the author neither knows nor cares; as he has little re&s;pect for any of that &s;ort of philo&s;ophy. This may be becau&s;e his capacity and knowledge do not reach to it. If &s;uch be the ca&s;e, he cannot be blamed, if he acts on the &s;en&s;e of that incapacity; he cannot be blamed, if in the mo&s;t arduous and critical que&s;tions which can po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e, and which affect to the quick the vital parts of our con&s;titu|tion, he takes the &s;ide which leans mo&s;t to &s;afety and &s;ettlement; <Q>that he is re&s;olved not &startq;to be wi&s;e beyond what is written&endq; in the legi&s;lative record and practice;</Q> that when doubts ari&s;e on them, he endeavours to interpret one &s;tatute by another; and to reconcile them all to e&s;tabli&s;hed recognized morals, and to the general antient known policy of the laws of England. Two things are equally evident, the fir&s;t is, that the legi&s;lature po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the
<PB N="70" REF="71">
power of regulating the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown; the &s;econd, that in the exerci&s;e of that right it has uniformly acted as if under the <HI>re&s;traints</HI> which the author has &s;tated. That author makes what the antients call <HI>mos majorum,</HI> not indeed his &s;ole, but certainly his principal rule of policy, to guide his judgment in whatever regards our laws. Unifor|mity and analogy can be pre&s;erved in them by this proce&s;s only. That point being fixed, and laying fa&s;t hold of a &s;trong bottom, our &s;pecula|tions may &s;wing in all directions, without public de|triment; becau&s;e they will ride with &s;ure anchorage.</P>
<P>In this manner the&s;e things have been always con&s;idered by our ance&s;tors. There are &s;ome in|deed who have the art of turning the very acts of parliament which were made for &s;ecuring the here|ditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the pre&s;ent royal family by ren|dering it penal to doubt of the validity of tho&s;e acts of parliament, into an in&s;trument for defeating all their ends and purpo&s;es: but upon grounds &s;o very fooli&s;h, that it is not worth while to take further notice of &s;uch &s;ophi&s;try.</P>
<P>To prevent any unnece&s;&s;ary &s;ubdivi&s;ion, I &s;hall here put together what may be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the perfect agreement of the Whigs with Mr. Burke, in his a&s;&s;ertions, <Q>that the Revolution made no &startq;e&s;&s;ential change in the con&s;titution of the mo|narchy, or in any of its ancient, &s;ound, and legal principles; that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was &s;ettled in the Hanover family, upon the idea, and in the mode of an hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion qualified with Prote&s;tanti&s;m; that it was not &s;ettled upon <HI>elective</HI> principles, in any &s;en&s;e of the word <HI>elective,</HI> or under any modification or de&s;cription of <HI>election</HI> what&s;oever; but, on the contrary, that the nation, after the Revolution, renewed by a fre&s;h compact the &s;pirit of the original compact of the &s;tate,

<P><Q>&startq;The re&s;i&s;tance at the Revolution, which was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolution no prece|dent for voluntary cancelling allegiance.</NOTE> founded in <HI>unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity,</HI> could be no de|fence to a man that was attacked <HI>for a&s;&s;erting that the people might cancel their allegiance at plea|&s;ure, or dethrone and murder their &s;overeign by a judiciary &s;entence.</HI> For it can never be inferred from the lawfulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;tance, at a time when <HI>a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the government both in church and &s;tate was intended,</HI> that a people may take up arms, and <HI>call their &s;overeign to account at plea&s;ure;</HI> and, therefore, &s;ince <HI>the Revolution could be of no &s;ervice in giving the lea&s;t colour for a&s;&s;erting</HI>
<PB N="74" REF="75">
<HI>any &s;uch wicked principle,</HI> the Doctor could never intend to put it into the mouths of tho&s;e new preachers, and new politicians, for a defence; unle&s;s it be his opinion, that the re&s;i&s;tance at the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Revolution not like the ca&s;e of Charles the Fir&s;t.</NOTE> Revolution can bear any parallel with the <HI>execra|ble murder of the royal martyr, &s;o ju&s;tly dete&s;ted by the whole nation.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is plain that the Doctor is not impeached for preaching a general doctrine, and enforcing the general duty of obedience, but for preaching again&s;t an <HI>excepted ca&s;e, after he has &s;tated the ex|ception.</HI> He is not impeached for preaching the general doctrine of obedience, and the utter ille|gality of re&s;i&s;tance upon any pretence what&s;oever; but becau&s;e, having fir&s;t laid down the general doctrine as true, without any exception, <HI>he &s;tates the excepted ca&s;e,</HI> the Revolution, in expre&s;s terms, as an objection; and then a&s;&s;uming the con&s;ide|ration of that excepted ca&s;e, denies there was any re&s;i&s;tance in the Revolution; and a&s;&s;erts, that to impute re&s;i&s;tance to the Revolution, would ca&s;t black and odious colours upon it. This is not preaching the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance, in the <HI>general</HI> terms u&s;ed by the homilies, and the fa|thers of the church, where ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity may be <HI>under&s;tood to be excepted by a tacit implication, as the coun&s;el have allowed;</HI> but is preaching directly again&s;t the re&s;i&s;tance at the Revolution, which, in the cour&s;e of this debate, has been all along ad|mitted to <HI>be nece&s;&s;ary and ju&s;t,</HI> and can have no other meaning than to bring a di&s;honour <NOTE PLACE="marg">Sacheve|rel's doc|trine in|tended to bring an odium on the Revo|lution.</NOTE> upon the Revolution, and an odium upon tho&s;e great and illu&s;trious per&s;ons, <HI>tho&s;e friends to the monarchy and the church, that a&s;&s;i&s;ted in bringing it about.</HI> For had the Doctor intended any thing el&s;e, he would have treated the ca&s;e of the Revolution in a different manner, and have given <HI>it the true and fair an&s;wer;</HI> he would have &s;aid, that the re|&s;i&s;tance <NOTE PLACE="marg">True de|fence of theRevolution on ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity.</NOTE>
<PB N="75" REF="76">
at the Revolution was <HI>of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, and the only means left to revive the con&s;titution; and mu&s;t therefore be taken as an excepted ca&s;e,</HI> and could never come within the reach and inten|tion&endq; of the general doctrine of the church.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Your lord&s;hips take notice on what grounds the Doctor continues to a&s;&s;ert the &s;ame po&s;ition in his an&s;wer. But is it not mo&s;t evident, that the ge|neral exhortations to be met with in the homilies of the church of England, and &s;uch like decla|rations in the &s;tatutes of the kingdom, are meant only as rules for the civil obedience of the &s;ubject to the legal admini&s;tration of the &s;upreme power in <HI>ordinary ca&s;es?</HI> And it is equally ab&s;urd, to con|&s;true any words in a po&s;itive law to authorize the de&s;truction of the whole, as to expect that king, lords, and commons &s;hould, in expre&s;s terms of law, declare <HI>&s;uch an ultimate re&s;ort as the right of re&s;i&s;tance, at a time when the ca&s;e &s;uppo&s;es that the&endq; force of all law is cea&s;ed.</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Reflections, p. 42, 43.</NOTE>.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The Commons mu&s;t always re&s;ent, with the ut|mo&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">Commons abhor what|ever &s;hakes the &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion of po&s;|terity to the &s;ettlement of the crown.</NOTE> dete&s;tation and abhorrence, every po&s;ition that may &s;hake the authority of that act of par|liament, whereby the crown is &s;ettled upon her maje&s;ty, <HI>and whereby the lords &s;piritual and temporal and commons do, in the name of all the people of Eng|land, mo&s;t humbly and faithfully &s;ubmit them&s;elves, their heirs and po&s;terities, to her maje&s;ty,</HI> which this general principle of ab&s;olute non-re&s;i&s;tance mu&s;t&endq; certainly &s;hake.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;For, if the re&s;i&s;tance at the Revolution was ille|gal, the Revolution &s;ettled in u&s;urpation, and this act can have no greater force and authority than&endq; an act pa&s;&s;ed under an u&s;urper.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;And the Commons take leave to ob&s;erve, that the authority of the parliamentary &s;ettlement is a
<PB N="76" REF="77">
matter of the greate&s;t con&s;equence to maintain, in a ca&s;e where the hereditary right to the crown is&endq; conte&s;ted.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It appears by the &s;everal in&s;tances mentioned in the act declaring the rights and liberties of the &s;ubject, and &s;ettling the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the crown, that at the time of the Revolution there was <HI>a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the con&s;titution of government both in church and &s;tate, which is a ca&s;e that the laws of England could never &s;uppo&s;e, provide for, or have in view.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P>Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl, &s;o often quoted, con&s;idered the pre&s;ervation of the monarchy, and of the rights and prerogatives of the crown, as e&s;&s;ential objects with all &s;ound Whigs; and that they were bound, not on|ly to maintain them when injured or invaded, but to exert them&s;elves as much for their re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, if they &s;hould happen to be over thrown by popular fu|ry, as any of their own more immediate and popu|lar rights and privileges, if the latter &s;hould be at any time &s;ubverted by the crown. For this rea&s;on he puts the ca&s;es of the <HI>Revolution</HI> and the <HI>Re&s;tora|tion,</HI> exactly upon the &s;ame footing. He plainly marks, that it was the object of all hone&s;t men, not to &s;acrifice one part of the con&s;titution to an|other; and much more, not to &s;acrifice any of them to vi&s;ionary theories of the rights of man; but to pre&s;erve our whole inheritance in the con&s;titution, in all its members and all its relations, entire, and unimpaired, from generation to generation. In this Mr. Burke exactly agrees with him.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SIR JOSEPH JEKYL,</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;Nothing is plainer than that the people have a right to the laws and the con&s;titution. This <NOTE PLACE="marg">What are the rights of the people.</NOTE>
<PB N="77" REF="78">
right the nation hath a&s;&s;erted, and recovered out of the hands of tho&s;e who had di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them of it at &s;everal times. There are of this <HI>two famous in&s;tances</HI> in the knowledge of the pre&s;ent age; I mean that of the <HI>Re&s;tauration,</HI> and that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;toration and Revo|lution.</NOTE> of the <HI>Revolution;</HI> in both of the&s;e great events were the <HI>regal power,</HI> and the <HI>rights of the people</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">People have an equal in|tere&s;t in the legal rights of the crown and of their own.</NOTE> recovered. And it is <HI>hard to &s;ay in which the people have the greate&s;t intere&s;t; for the commons are &s;en&s;ible that there is not one legal power be|longing to the crown, but they have an intere&s;t in it; and I doubt not but they will always be as careful to &s;upport the rights of the crown, as their own privileges.&endq;</HI></Q></P>
<P>The other Whig managers regarded (as he did) the overturning, of the monarchy by a republican faction with the very &s;ame horror and dete&s;tation with which they regarded the de&s;truction of the privileges of the people by an arbitrary mo|narch.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>MR. LECHMERE,</HEAD>
<P><Q>Speaking of our con&s;titution, &s;tates it as &startq;a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;titu|tion reco|vered at the re&s;toration and revolu|tion.</NOTE> con&s;titution which happily recovered it&s;elf, at the Re&s;toration, from the confu&s;ions and di&s;|orders which <HI>the horrid and dete&s;table proceed|ings of faction and u&s;urpation had thrown it into,</HI> and which, after many convul&s;ions and &s;truggles, was providentially &s;aved at the late happy Revo|lution; and, by the many good laws pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince that time, &s;tands now upon a firmer foundation: together with the mo&s;t comfortable pro&s;pect of <HI>&s;ecurity to all po&s;terity,</HI> by the &s;ettlement of the crown in the Prote&s;tant line.&endq;</Q></P>
</DIV2>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<P><PB N="78" REF="79">
I mean now to &s;hew that the Whigs, (if Sir Jo&s;eph Jekyl was one) and if he &s;poke in conformity to the &s;en&s;e of the Whig hou&s;e of commons and the Whig mini&s;try who employed him, did care|fully guard again&s;t any pre&s;umption that might ari&s;e from the repeal of the non-re&s;i&s;tance oath or Charles the &s;econd, as if, at the Revolution, the an|tient principles of our government were at all chang|ed&mdash;or that republican doctrines were countenanced,&mdash;or any &s;anction given to &s;editious proceedings upon general undefined ideas of mi&s;conduct&mdash;or for changing the form of government&mdash;or for re&s;i&s;tance upon any other ground than the <HI>nece&s;&s;ity</HI> &s;o often mentioned for the purpo&s;e of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation. It will &s;hew &s;till more clearly the equal care of the then Whigs, to prevent either the regal power from being &s;wallowed up on pretence of popular rights, or the popular rights from being de&s;troyed on pretence of regal prerogatives.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>SIR JOSEPH JEKYL.</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;Further, I de&s;ire it may be con&s;idered, that <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mi&s;chief of broaching antimonar|chical prin|ciples.</NOTE> the&s;e legi&s;lators [the legi&s;lators who framed the non-re&s;i&s;tance oath of Charles the Second] were guarding again&s;t the con&s;equences of tho&s;e <HI>per|nicious and antimonarchical principles, which had been broached a little before in this nation;</HI> and tho&s;e large declarations in favour of <HI>non-re&s;i&s;tance</HI> were made to encounter or obviate the <HI>mi&s;chief</HI> of tho&s;e principles; as appears by the preamble to the fulle&s;t of tho&s;e acts, which is the <HI>militia act,</HI> in the 13th and 14th of King Charles the Second. The words of that act are the&s;e: <HI>And, during the</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Two ca&s;es of re&s;i&s;t|ance, one to pre&s;erve the crown, the other the rights of the &s;ubject.</NOTE> <HI>late u&s;urped governments, many evil and rebellious principles have been in&s;tilled into the minds of the people of this kingdom, which may break forth, unle&s;s prevented, to the di&s;turbance of the peace and quiet</HI>

<HI>thereof: Be it therefore enacted, &amp;c.</HI> Here your lord&s;hips may &s;ee the rea&s;on that inclined tho&s;e legi&s;lators to expre&s;s them&s;elves in &s;uch a manner again&s;t re&s;i&s;tance. <HI>They had &s;een the regal rights &s;wallowed up, under the pretence of popular ones;</HI> and it is no imputation on them that they did not then fore&s;ee a <HI>quite different ca&s;e,</HI> as was that of the Re|volution; where, under the pretence of regal au|thority, a total &s;ubver&s;ion of the rights of the &s;ubject was advanced, and in a manner effected. And this may &s;erve to &s;hew, that it was not the de&s;ign of tho&s;e legi&s;lators to condemn re&s;i&s;tance, in a ca&s;e <HI>of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, for pre&s;erving the con&s;titution,</HI> when they were guarding again&s;t principles which had &s;o&endq; lately de&s;troyed it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;As to the truth of the doctrine in this declara|tion <NOTE PLACE="marg">Non-re&s;i&s;t|ance oath not repeal|ed, becau&s;e (with the re&s;triction of nece&s;&s;ity) it was taken but to prevent fal&s;e inter|pretations.</NOTE> which was repealed, <HI>I will admit it to be as true as the Doctor's coun&s;el a&s;&s;ert it; that is, with an exception of ca&s;es of nece&s;&s;ity;</HI> and it was not re|pealed becau&s;e it was fal&s;e, <HI>under&s;tanding it with that re&s;triction;</HI> but it was repealed becau&s;e it might be interpreted in <HI>an unconfined &s;en&s;e, and ex|clu&s;ive of that re&s;triction;</HI> and being &s;o under&s;tood, would reflect on the ju&s;tice of the Revolution: and this the legi&s;lature had at heart, and were very jealous of; and by this repeal of that decla|ration, gave a parliamentary or legi&s;lative admo|nition, again&s;t a&s;&s;erting this doctrine of non-re|&s;i&s;tance <HI>in an unlimited &s;en&s;e.&endq;&mdash;</HI></Q></P>

<P>Another of the managers for the hou&s;e of com|mons, Sir John Holland, was not le&s;s careful in guarding again&s;t a confu&s;ion of the principles of the revolution, with any loo&s;e general doctrines of a right in the individual, or even in the people, to under|take for them&s;elves, on any prevalent tempo|rary opinions of convenience or improvement, any fundamental change in the con&s;titution, or to fabricate a new government for them&s;elves, and thereby to di&s;turb the public peace, and to un&s;ettle the antient con&s;titution of this kingdom.</P>

<DIV1>
<P>In the &s;pirit, and upon one occa&s;ion in the words <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Declaration of Right.</NOTE>, of this declaration, the &s;tatutes pa&s;&s;ed in that reign made &s;uch provi&s;ions for preventing the&s;e dangers, that &s;carcely any thing &s;hort of combination
<PB N="83" REF="84">
of king, lords, and commons for the de&s;truction of the liberties of the nation, can in any probability make us liable to &s;imilar perils. In that dreadful, and, I hope, not to be looked for ca&s;e, any opinion of a right to make revolutions, grounded on this pre|cedent, would be but a poor re&s;ource.&mdash;Dreadful indeed would be our &s;ituation.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the doctrines held by <HI>the Whigs of the Revolution,</HI> delivered with as much &s;olemnity, and as authentically at lea&s;t, as any political dog|mas were ever promulgated from the beginning of the world. If there be any difference between their tenets and tho&s;e of Mr. Burke it is, that the old Whigs oppo&s;e them&s;elves &s;till more &s;trongly than he does again&s;t the doctrines which are now propagated with &s;o much indu&s;try by tho&s;e who would be thought their &s;ucce&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>It will be &s;aid perhaps, that the old Whigs, in order to guard them&s;elves again&s;t popular odium, pretended to a&s;&s;ert tenets contrary to tho&s;e which they &s;ecretly held. This, if true, would prove, what Mr. Burke has uniformly a&s;&s;erted, that the extrava|gant doctrines which he meant to expo&s;e, were di&s;|agreeable to the body of the people; who, though they perfectly abhor a de&s;potic government, cer|tainly approach more nearly to the love of mitigated monarchy, than to any thing which bears the ap|pearance even of the be&s;t republic. But if the&s;e old Whigs deceived the people, their conduct was unaccountable indeed. They expo&s;ed their power, as every one conver&s;ant in hi&s;tory knows, to the greate&s;t peril, for the propagation of opinions which, on this hypothe&s;is, they did not hold. It is a new kind of martyrdom. This &s;uppo&s;ition does as little credit to their integrity as their wi&s;dom: It makes them at once hypocrites and fools. I think of tho&s;e great men very differently. I hold them to have been, what the world thought them,
<PB N="84" REF="85">
men of deep under&s;tanding, open &s;incerity, and clear honour. However, be that matter as it may; what the&s;e old Whigs pretended to be, Mr. Burke is. This is enough for him.</P>
<P>I do indeed admit, that though Mr. Burke has proved that his opinions were tho&s;e of the old Whig party, &s;olemnly declared by one hou&s;e, in effect and &s;ub&s;tance by both hou&s;es of parliament, this te&s;timony &s;tanding by it&s;elf will form no proper defence for his opinions, if he and the old Whigs were both of them in the wrong. But it is his pre&s;ent concern, not to vindicate the&s;e old Whigs, but to &s;hew his agreement with them.&mdash;He appeals to them as judges: he does not vindicate them as culprits. It is current that the&s;e old politicians knew little of the rights of men; that they lo&s;t their way by groping about in the dark, and fum|bling among rotten parchments and mu&s;ty records. Great lights they &s;ay are lately obtained in the world; and Mr. Burke, in&s;tead of &s;hrowding him&s;elf in ex|ploded ignorance, ought to have taken advantage of the blaze of illumination which has been &s;pread about him. It may be &s;o. The enthu&s;ia&s;ts of this time, it &s;eems, like their predece&s;&s;ors in another faction of fanatici&s;m, deal in lights.&mdash;Hudibras plea|&s;antly &s;ays of them, they</P>
<Q><L>Have <HI>lights,</HI> where better eyes are blind,</L>
<L>As pigs are &s;aid to &s;ee the wind.</L></Q>
<P>The author of the Reflections has <HI>heard</HI> a great deal concerning the modern lights; but he has not yet had the good fortune to <HI>&s;ee</HI> much of them. He has read more than he can ju&s;tify to any thing but the &s;pirit of curio&s;ity, of the works of the&s;e illuminators of the world. He has learn|ed nothing from the far greater number of them, than a full certainty of their &s;hallowne&s;s, levity, pride, petulance, pre&s;umption and ignorance.
<PB N="85" REF="86">
Where the old authors whom he has read, and the old men whom he has conver&s;ed with, have left him in the dark, he is in the dark &s;till. If others, however, have obtained any of this extraor|dinary light, they will u&s;e it to guide them in their re&s;earches and their conduct. I have only to wi&s;h, that the nation may be as happy and as pro&s;perous under the influence of the new light, as it has been in the &s;ober &s;hade of the old ob&s;curity. As to the re&s;t, it will be difficult for the author of the Re|flections to conform to the principles of the avowed leaders of the party, until they appear otherwi&s;e than negatively. All we can gather from them is this, that their principles are diametrically oppo&s;ite to his. This is all that we know from authority. Their negative declaration obliges me to have re|cour&s;e to the books which contain po&s;itive doc|trines. They are indeed, to tho&s;e Mr. Burke holds, diametrically oppo&s;ite; and if it be true, (as they have &s;aid, I hope ha&s;tily) that their opinions differ &s;o widely, it &s;hould &s;eem they are the mo&s;t likely to form the creed of the modern Whigs.</P>
<P>I have &s;tated what were the avowed &s;entiments of the old Whigs, not in the way of argu|ment, but narratively; it is but fair to &s;et before the reader, in the &s;ame &s;imple manner, the &s;enti|ments of the modern, to which they &s;pare neither pains nor expence to make pro&s;elytes. I choo&s;e them from the books upon which mo&s;t of that in|du&s;try and expenditure in circulation have been em|ployed; I choo&s;e them not from tho&s;e who &s;peak with a politic ob&s;curity; not from tho&s;e who only controvert the opinions of the old Whigs, without advancing any of their own, but from tho&s;e who &s;peak plainly and affirmatively. The Whig reader may make his choice between the two doctrines.</P>
<P>The doctrine then propagated by the&s;e &s;ocieties, which gentlemen think they ought to be very

tender in di&s;couraging, as nearly as po&s;&s;ible in their own words, is as follows: that in Great Britain we are not only without a good con&s;titu|tion, but that we have <Q>no con&s;titution.</Q> <Q>That, &startq;tho' it is much talked about, no &s;uch thing as a con&s;titution exi&s;ts, or ever did exi&s;t; and con&s;e|quently that <HI>the people have a con&s;titution yet to form;</HI> that &s;ince William the Conqueror, the country has never yet <HI>regenerated it&s;elf,</HI> and is therefore without a con&s;titution. That where it cannot be produced in a vi&s;ible form, there is none.

That <HI>every thing</HI> in the Engli&s;h government is the rever&s;e of what it ought to be, and what it is &s;aid to be in England. That the right of war and peace re&s;ides in a metaphor &s;hewn at the Tower, for &s;ix pence or a &s;hilling a-piece.&mdash;That it &s;ig|nifies not where the right re&s;ides, whether in the crown or in parliament.

<P>As to our law of primogeniture, which with few and incon&s;iderable exceptions is the &s;tanding law of all our landed inheritance, and which without que&s;|tion has a tendency, and I think a mo&s;t happy tendency, to pre&s;erve a character of con&s;equence, weight, and prevalent influence over others in the whole body of the landed intere&s;t, they call loudly for its de&s;truction.

<P>As to our monarchy, they had formerly been more tender of that branch of the con&s;titution, and for a good rea&s;on.

what are its merits? Doth the virtue con&s;i&s;t in the metaphor, or in the man? Doth the gold|&s;mith that makes the crown make the virtue al|&s;o? Doth it operate like Fortunatus's wi&s;hing|cap, or Harlequin's wooden &s;word? Doth it make a man a conjuror? In fine, what is it? It ap|pears to be a &s;omething going much out of fa&s;hion, falling into ridicule, and rejected in &s;ome countries both as unnece&s;&s;ary and expen&s;ive.

<P><Q>&startq;Mr. Burke talks about what he calls an here|ditary crown, as if it were &s;ome production of Nature; or as if, like Time, it had a power to operate, not only independently, but in &s;pite of man; or as if it were a thing or a &s;ubject uni|ver&s;ally con&s;ented to.

<P>The Revolution and Hanover &s;ucce&s;&s;ion had been objects of the highe&s;t veneration to the old Whigs.

<P><Q>&startq;Mr. Burke (&s;ay they) has done &s;ome &s;ervice, not to his cau&s;e, but to his country, by bringing tho&s;e clau&s;es into public view.

It &s;hews that the rights of man were but imperfectly under&s;tood at the Revolution; for, certain it is, that the right which that parliament &s;et up by <HI>a&s;&s;umption</HI> (for by delegation it had it not, and could not have it, becau&s;e none could give it) over the per&s;ons and freedom of po&s;terity for ever, was of the &s;ame tyrannical unfounded kind which

James attempted to &s;et up over the parliament and the nation, and for which he was expelled.

<P>The&s;e &s;ocieties of modern Whigs pu&s;h their in|&s;olence as far as it can go. In order to prepare the minds of the people for trea&s;on and rebellion, they repre&s;ent the king as tainted with principles of de&s;|poti&s;m, from the circum&s;tance of his having domi|nions in Germany. In direct defiance of the mo&s;t notorious truth, they de&s;cribe his government there to be a de&s;poti&s;m; whereas it is a free con&s;titution, in which the &s;tates of the electorate have their part in the government; and this privilege has never been infringed by the king, or, that I have heard of, by any of his predece&s;&s;ors. The con&s;ti|tution of the electoral dominions has indeed a dou|ble control, both from the laws of the empire, and from the privileges of the country. Whatever rights the king enjoys as elector, have been always pa|rentally exerci&s;ed, and the calumnies of the&s;e &s;can|dalous &s;ocieties have not been authorized by a &s;ingle complaint of oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>

up the million &s;terling a year, which the country gives the per&s;on it &s;tiles a king.

This &s;pecies of government comes from Germany; and re|minds me of what one of the Brun&s;wick &s;oldiers told me, who was taken pri&s;oner by the Ameri|cans&endq; in the late war:</Q> 'Ah!' &s;aid he, <Q>&startq;America is a fine free country, it is worth the people's fighting for; I know the difference by knowing my own: in my country, <HI>if the prince &s;ays, Eat &s;traw, we eat &s;traw.&endq;</HI></Q> <Q>&startq;God help that country, thought I, be it England or el&s;ewhere, who&s;e li|berties are to be protected by <HI>German principles of government, and princes of Brun&s;wick!&endq;</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is &s;omewhat curious to ob&s;erve, that although the people of England have been in the habit of talking about kings, it is always a Foreign Hou&s;e of kings; hating Foreigners, yet governed by them.&mdash;It is now the Hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, one of the petty tribes of Germany.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;If Government be what Mr. Burke de&s;cribes it, 'a contrivance of human wi&s;dom,' I might a&s;k him, if wi&s;dom was at &s;uch a low ebb in Eng|land, that it was become nece&s;&s;ary to import it from Holland and from Hanover? But I will do the country the ju&s;tice to &s;ay, that was not the ca&s;e; and even if it was, it mi&s;took the cargo.

<P>The&s;e are the notions which, under the idea of Whig principles, &s;everal per&s;ons, and among them per&s;ons of no mean mark, have a&s;&s;ociated them|&s;elves to propagate.

This will probably be done (if &s;uch writings &s;hall be thought to de&s;erve any other than the refutation of criminal ju&s;tice) by others, who may think with Mr. Burke, and with the &s;ame zeal. He has performed his part. I &s;hall content my&s;elf with &s;hewing, as &s;hortly as the matter will admit, the danger of giving to them, either avowedly or tacitly, the &s;malle&s;t countenance.</P>
<P>There are times and circum&s;tances, in which not to &s;peak out is at lea&s;t to connive.

Certainly they are not owned. But are they condemned with the &s;ame zeal as Mr. Burke and his book are con|demned? Are they condemned at all? Are they rejected or di&s;countenanced in any way what&s;oever? Is any man who would fairly examine into the de|meanour

and principles of tho&s;e &s;ocieties, and that too very moderately, and in the way rather of ad|monition than of puni&s;hment, is &s;uch a man even decently treated? Is he not reproached as if, in condemning &s;uch principles, he had belied the con|duct of his whole life, &s;ugge&s;ting that his life had been governed by principles &s;imilar to tho&s;e which he now reprobates? The French &s;y&s;tem is in the mean time, by many active agents out of doors, rap|turou&s;ly prai&s;ed; The Briti&s;h con&s;titution is coldly tolerated. But the&s;e con&s;titutions are different, both in the foundation and in the whole &s;uper&s;tructure; and it is plain, that you cannot build up the one but on the ruins of the other. After all, if the French be a &s;upe|rior &s;y&s;tem of liberty, why &s;hould we not adopt it? To what end are our prai&s;es? Is excellence held out to us only that we &s;hould not copy after it? And what is there in the manners of the people, or in the climate of France, which renders that &s;pecies of re|public fitted for them, and un&s;uitable to us? A &s;trong and marked difference between the two nations ought to be &s;hewn, before we can admit a con&s;tant affected panegyrick, a &s;tanding annual commemo|ration, to be without any tendency to an example.</P>
<P>But the leaders of party will not go the length of the doctrines taught by the &s;editious clubs. I am &s;ure they do not mean to do &s;o. God forbid! Perhaps even tho&s;e who are directly carrying on the work of this pernicious foreign faction, do not all of them intend to produce all the mi&s;chiefs which mu&s;t inevitably follow from their having any &s;ucce&s;s in their proceedings. As to leaders in par|ties, nothing is more common than to &s;ee them blindly led. The world is governed by go-be|tweens. The&s;e go-betweens influence the per&s;ons with whom they carry on the intercour&s;e, by &s;tating their own &s;en&s;e to each of them as the &s;en&s;e of the other; and thus they reciprocally ma&s;ter both &s;ides. It is fir&s;t buzzed about the ears of leaders, <Q>&startq;that their friends without doors
<PB N="97" REF="98">
are very eager for &s;ome mea&s;ure, or very warm about &s;ome opinion&mdash;that you mu&s;t not be too rigid with them. They are u&s;eful per&s;ons, and zealous in the cau&s;e. They may be a little wrong; but the &s;pirit of liberty mu&s;t not be damped; and by the influence you obtain from &s;ome degree of concurrence with them at pre&s;ent, you may be enabled to &s;et them right hereafter.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Thus the leaders are at fir&s;t drawn to a conni|vance with &s;entiments and proceedings, often to|tally different from their &s;erious and deliberate notions. But their acquie&s;cence an&s;wers every purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>With no better than &s;uch powers, the go-be|tweens a&s;&s;ume a new repre&s;entative character. What at be&s;t was but an acquie&s;cence, is magnified into an authority, and thence into a de&s;ire on the part of the leaders; and it is carried down as &s;uch to the &s;ubordinate members of parties. By this artifice they in their turn are led into mea&s;ures which at fir&s;t, perhaps, few of them wi&s;hed at all, or at lea&s;t did not de&s;ire vehemently or &s;y&s;tematically.</P>
<P>There is in all parties, between the principal lead|ers in parliament, and the lowe&s;t followers out of doors, a middle &s;ort of men; a &s;ort of eque&s;trian order, who, by the &s;pirit of that middle &s;ituation, are the fitte&s;t for preventing things from running to exce&s;s. But indeci&s;ion, though a vice of a totally different character, is the natural accomplice of vi|olence. The irre&s;olution and timidity of tho&s;e who compo&s;e this middle order, often prevents the effect of their controlling &s;ituation. The fear of differing with the authority of leaders on the one hand, and of contradicting the de&s;ires of the multitude on the other, induces them to give a carele&s;s and pa&s;&s;ive a&s;|&s;ent to mea&s;ures in which they never were con&s;ulted: and thus things proceed, by a &s;ort of activity of inertne&s;s, until whole bodies, leaders, middle men,
<PB N="98" REF="99">
and followers, are all hurried, with every appear|ance, and with many of the effects, of unanimity, into &s;chemes of politics, in the &s;ub&s;tance of which no two of them were ever fully agreed, and the origin and authors of which, in this circular mode of communication, none of them find it po&s;&s;ible to trace. In my experience I have &s;een much of this in affairs, which, though trifling in compa|ri&s;on to the pre&s;ent, were yet of &s;ome importance to parties; and I have known them &s;uffer by it. The &s;ober part give their &s;anction, at fir&s;t through inattention and levity; at la&s;t they give it through nece&s;&s;ity. A violent &s;pirit is rai&s;ed, which the pre|&s;iding minds, after a time, find it impracticable to &s;top at their plea&s;ure, to control, to regulate, or even to direct.</P>
<P>This &s;hews, in my opinion, how very quick and awakened all men ought to be, who are looked up to by the public, and who de&s;erve that confi|dence, to prevent a &s;urpri&s;e on their opinions, when dogmas are &s;pread, and projects pur&s;ued, by which the foundations of &s;ociety may be affected. Before they li&s;ten even to moderate alterations in the govern|ment of their country, they ought to take care that principles are not propagated for that purpo&s;e, which are too big for their object. Doctrines limit|ed in their pre&s;ent application, and wide in their general principles, are never meant to be confined to what they at fir&s;t pretend. If I were to form a progno&s;tic of the effect of the pre&s;ent machinations on the people, from their &s;en&s;e of any grievance they &s;uffer under this con&s;titution, my mind would be at ea&s;e. But there is a wide difference between the multitude, when they act again&s;t their government from a &s;en&s;e of grievance, or from zeal for &s;ome opinions. When men are thoroughly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with that zeal, it is difficult to calculate its force. It is certain, that its power is by no means in exact
<PB N="99" REF="100">
proportion to its rea&s;onablene&s;s. It mu&s;t always have been di&s;coverable by per&s;ons of reflection, but it is now obvious to the world, that a theory con|cerning government may become as much a cau&s;e of fanatici&s;m as a <HI>dogma</HI> in religion. There is a boundary to men's pa&s;&s;ions when they act from feeling; none when they are under the influence of imagination. Remove a grievance, and, when men act from feeling, you go a great way towards quieting a commotion. But the good or bad con|duct of a government, the protection men have en|joyed, or the oppre&s;&s;ion they have &s;uffered under it, are of no &s;ort of moment, when a faction proceeding upon &s;peculative grounds, is thoroughly heated again&s;t its form. When a man is, from &s;y&s;tem, furious again&s;t monarchy or epi&s;copacy, the good conduct of the monarch or the bi&s;hop has no other effect than further to irritate the adver&s;ary. He is provoked at it as furni&s;hing a plea for pre&s;erving the thing which he wi&s;hes to de&s;troy. His mind will be heated as much by the &s;ight of a &s;ceptre, a mace, or a verge, as if he had been daily brui&s;ed and wounded by the&s;e &s;ymbols of authority. Mere &s;pectacles, mere names, will become &s;ufficient cau&s;es to &s;timulate the people to war and tumult.</P>
<P>Some gentlemen are not terrified by the facility with which government has been overturned in France. The people of France, they &s;ay, had no|thing to lo&s;e in the de&s;truction of a bad con&s;titu|tion; but though not the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible, we have &s;till a good &s;take in ours, which will hinder us from de&s;perate ri&s;ques. Is this any &s;ecurity at all again&s;t tho&s;e who &s;eem to per&s;uade them&s;elves, and who labour to per&s;uade others, that our con&s;titution is an u&s;urpation in its origin, unwi&s;e in its contrivance, mi&s;chievous in its effects, contrary to the rights of man, and in all its parts a perfect nui&s;ance? What motive has any rational man, who thinks in that
<PB N="100" REF="101">
manner, to &s;pill his blood, or even to ri&s;que a &s;hilling of his fortune, or a moment of his lei&s;ure, to pre&s;erve it? If he has any duty relative to it, his duty is to de&s;troy it. A con&s;titution on &s;ufferance is a con&s;titution condemned. Sentence is already pa&s;&s;ed upon it. The execution is only delayed. On the principles of the&s;e gentlemen it neither has, nor ought to have, any &s;ecurity. So far as regards them, it is left naked, without friends, partizans, a&s;&s;er|tors, or protectors.</P>
<P>Let us examine into the value of this &s;ecurity upon the principles of tho&s;e who are more &s;ober; of tho&s;e who think, indeed, the French con&s;titution better, or at lea&s;t as good, as the Briti&s;h, without going to all the lengths of the warmer politicians in reprobating their own. Their &s;ecurity amounts in reality to nothing more than this;&mdash;that the dif|ference between their republican &s;y&s;tem and the Briti&s;h limited monarchy is not worth a civil war. This opinion, I admit, will prevent people, not very enterpri&s;ing in their nature, from an active un|dertaking again&s;t the Briti&s;h con&s;titution. But it is the poore&s;t defen&s;ive principle that ever was in|fu&s;ed into the mind of man again&s;t the attempts of tho&s;e who will enterpri&s;e. It will tend totally to remove from their minds that very terror of a civil war which is held out as our &s;ole &s;ecurity. They who think &s;o well of the French con&s;titution, cer|tainly will not be the per&s;ons to carry on a war to prevent their obtaining a great benefit, or at wor&s;t a fair exchange. They will not go to battle in favour of a cau&s;e in which their defeat might be more advantageous to the public than their victory. They mu&s;t at lea&s;t tacitly abet tho&s;e who endeavour to make converts to a &s;ound opinion; they mu&s;t di&s;|countenance tho&s;e who would oppo&s;e its propaga|tion. In proportion as by the&s;e means the enter|pri&s;ing party is &s;trengthened, the dread of a &s;truggle
<PB N="101" REF="102">
is le&s;&s;ened. See what an encouragement this is to the enemies of the con&s;titution! A few a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tions, and a very great de&s;truction of property, we know they con&s;ider as no real ob&s;tacles in the way of a grand political change. And they will hope, that here, if antimonarchical opinions gain ground, as they have done in France, they may, as in France, accompli&s;h a revolution without a war.</P>
<P>They who think &s;o well of the French con&s;titu|tion cannot be &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed by any progre&s;s made by its partizans. Provi&s;ions for &s;ecurity are not to be received from tho&s;e who think that there is no danger.&mdash;No! there is no plan of &s;ecurity to be li&s;tened to but from tho&s;e who entertain the &s;ame fears with our&s;elves; from tho&s;e who think that the thing to be &s;ecured is a great ble&s;&s;ing; and the thing again&s;t which we would &s;ecure it a great mi&s;chief. Every per&s;on of a different opinion mu&s;t be carele&s;s about &s;ecurity.</P>
<P>I believe the author of the Reflections, whe|ther he fears the de&s;igns of that &s;et of people with rea&s;on or not, cannot prevail on him&s;elf to de&s;pi&s;e them. He cannot de&s;pi&s;e them for their numbers, which, though &s;mall, compared with the &s;ound part of the community, are not incon&s;idera|ble: he cannot look with contempt on their influ|ence, their activity, or the kind of talents and tem|pers which they po&s;&s;e&s;s, exactly calculated for the work they have in hand, and the minds they chiefly apply to. Do we not &s;ee their mo&s;t con&s;iderable and accredited mini&s;ters, and &s;everal of their party of weight and importance, active in &s;preading mi&s;|chievous opinions, in giving &s;anction to &s;editious writings, in promoting &s;editious anniver&s;aries? and what part of their de&s;cript on has di&s;owned them or their proceedings? When men, circum&s;tanced as the&s;e are, publickly declare &s;uch admiration of a foreign con&s;titution, and &s;uch contempt of our own,
<PB N="102" REF="103">
it would be, in the author of the Reflections, think|ing as he does of the French con&s;titution, infamou&s;ly to cheat the re&s;t of the nation to their ruin, to &s;ay there is no danger.</P>
<P>In e&s;timating danger, we are obliged to take into our calculation the character and di&s;po&s;ition of the enemy into who&s;e hands we may chance to fall. The genius of this faction is ea&s;ily di&s;cerned by ob&s;erving with what a very different eye they have viewed the late foreign revolutions. Two have pa&s;&s;ed be|fore them. That of France and that of Poland. The &s;tate of Poland was &s;uch, that there could &s;carcely exi&s;t two opinions, but that a reformation of its con&s;titution, even at &s;ome expence of blood, might be &s;een without much di&s;approbation. No confu|&s;ion could be feared in &s;uch an enterprize; becau&s;e the e&s;tabli&s;hment to be reformed was it&s;elf a &s;tate of confu&s;ion. A king without authority; nobles without union or &s;ubordination; a people without arts, indu&s;|try, commerce, or liberty; no order within; no defence without; no effective publick force, but a foreign force, which entered a naked country at will, and di&s;po&s;ed of every thing at plea&s;ure. Here was a &s;tate of things which &s;eemed to invite and might perhaps ju&s;tify bold enterprize and de&s;perate experi|ment. But in what manner was this chaos brought into order? The means were as &s;triking to the imagination, as &s;atisfactory to the rea&s;on, and &s;ooth|ing to the moral &s;entiments. In contemplating that change, humanity has every thing to rejoice and to glory in; nothing to be a&s;hamed of, nothing to &s;uffer. So far as it has gone, it probably is the mo&s;t pure and defecated public good which ever has been conferred on mankind. We have &s;een anarchy and &s;ervitude at once removed; a throne &s;trengthened for the protection of the people, with|out trenching on their liberties; all foreign cabal bani&s;hed, by changing the crown from elective to
<PB N="103" REF="104">
hereditary; and what was a matter of plea&s;ing wonder, we have &s;een a reigning king, from an heroic love to his country, exerting him&s;elf with all the toil, the dexterity, the management, the intrigue, in favour of a family of &s;trangers, with which ambitious men labour for the aggrandi&s;ement of their own. Ten millions of men in a way of being freed gradually, and therefore &s;afely to them&s;elves and the &s;tate, not from civil or political chains, which, bad as they are, only fetter the mind, but from &s;ub&s;tantial per|&s;onal bondage. Inhabitants of cities, before without privileges, placed in the con&s;ideration which belongs to that improved and connecting &s;ituation of &s;o|cial life. One of the mo&s;t proud, numerous, and fierce bodies of nobility and gentry ever known in the world, arranged only in the foremo&s;t rank of free and generous citizens. Not one man incurred lo&s;s, or &s;uffered degradation. All, from the king to the day-labourer, were improved in their condi|tion. Every thing was kept in its place and order; but in that place and order every thing was bet|tered. To add to this happy wonder (this unheard|of conjunction of wi&s;dom and fortune) not one drop of blood was &s;pilled; no treachery; no out|rage; no &s;y&s;tem of &s;lander more cruel than the &s;word; no &s;tudied in&s;ults on religion, morals, or manners; no &s;poil; no confi&s;cation; no citizen beg|gared; none impri&s;oned; none exiled: the whole was effected with a policy, a di&s;cretion, an unanimity and &s;ecrecy, &s;uch as have never been before known on any occa&s;ion; but &s;uch wonderful conduct was re|&s;erved for this glorious con&s;piracy in favour of the true and genuine rights and intere&s;ts of men. Happy people, if they know to proceed as they have begun! Happy prince, worthy to begin with &s;plendor, or to clo&s;e with glory, a race of patriots and of kings: and to leave
<Q><L>A name, which every wind to heav'n would bear,</L>

To fini&s;h all&mdash;this great good, as in the in&s;tant it is, contains in it the &s;eeds of all further improvement; and may be con&s;idered as in a regular progre&s;s, be|cau&s;e founded on &s;imilar principles, towards the &s;table excellence of a Briti&s;h con&s;titution.</P>
<P>Here was a matter for congratulation and for fe&s;tive remembrance through ages. Here morali&s;ts and divines might indeed relax in their temperance to exhilarate their humanity. But mark the cha|racter of our faction. All their enthu&s;ia&s;m is kept for the French revolution. They cannot pretend that France had &s;tood &s;o much in need of a change as Po|land. They cannot pretend that it has not obtained a better &s;y&s;tem of liberty or of government than it en|joyed before. They cannot a&s;&s;ert, that it co&s;t more dearly to the intere&s;ts and feelings of multitudes of men. But the cold and &s;ubordinate light in which they look upon the one, and the pains they take to preach up the other of the&s;e revolutions, leave us no choice in fixing on their motives. Both revolutions profe&s;s liberty as their object; but in obtaining this object the one proceeds from anarchy to order: the other from order to anarchy. The fir&s;t &s;ecures its li|berty by e&s;tabli&s;hing its throne; the other builds its freedom on the &s;ubver&s;ion of its monarchy. In the one their means are un&s;tained by crimes, and their &s;ettlement favours morality. In the other, vice and confu&s;ion are in the very e&s;&s;ence of their pur&s;uit and of their enjoyment. The circum&s;tances in which the&s;e two events differ, mu&s;t cau&s;e the dif|ference we make in their comparative e&s;timation. The&s;e turn the &s;cale with the &s;ocieties in favour of France. <HI>Ferrum e&s;t quod amant.</HI> The frauds, the violences, the &s;acrileges, the havock and ruin of fa|milies, the di&s;per&s;ion and exile of the pride and flower of a great country, the di&s;order, the confu|&s;ion, the anarchy, the violation of property, the cruel murders, the inhuman confi&s;cations, and in the
<PB N="105" REF="106">
end the in&s;olent domination of bloody, ferocious, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s clubs.&mdash;The&s;e are the things which they love and admire. What men admire and love, they would &s;urely act. Let us &s;ee what is done in France; and then let us undervalue any the &s;lighte&s;t danger of falling into the hands of &s;uch a mercile&s;s and &s;avage faction!</P>
<P><Q>&startq;But the leaders of the factious &s;ocieties are too wild to &s;ucceed in this their undertaking.&endq;</Q> I hope &s;o. But &s;uppo&s;ing them wild and ab&s;urd, is there no danger but from wi&s;e and reflecting men? Per|haps the greate&s;t mi&s;chiefs that have happened in the world, have happened from per&s;ons as wild as tho&s;e we think the wilde&s;t. In truth, they are the fitte&s;t beginners of all great changes. Why en|courage men in a mi&s;chievous proceeding, becau&s;e their ab&s;urdity may di&s;appoint their malice? <Q>&startq;But noticing them may give them con&s;equence.&endq;</Q> Cer|tainly. But they are noticed; and they are noticed, not with reproof, but with that kind of countenance which is given by an <HI>apparent</HI> concurrence (not a <HI>real</HI> one, I am convinced) of a great party, in the prai&s;es of the object which they hold out to imita|tion.</P>
<P>But I hear a language &s;till more extraordinary, and indeed of &s;uch a nature as mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e, or leave, us at their mercy. <Q>It is this &startq;You know their promptitude in writing, and their diligence in caballing; to write, &s;peak, or act again&s;t them, will only &s;timulate them to new efforts.&endq;</Q>&mdash;This way of con&s;idering the principle of their conduct pays but a poor compliment to the&s;e gentlemen. They pretend that their doctrines are infinitely beneficial to mankind; but it &s;eems they would keep them to them&s;elves, if they were not greatly provoked. They are benevolent from &s;pite. Their oracles are like tho&s;e of <HI>Proteus</HI> (whom &s;ome people think they re&s;emble in many particulars) who never would
<PB N="106" REF="107">
give his re&s;pon&s;es unle&s;s you u&s;ed him as ill as po&s;&s;ible. The&s;e cats, it &s;eems, would not give out their electrical light without having their backs well rubbed. But this is not to do them perfect ju&s;tice. They are &s;ufficiently communicative. Had they been quiet, the propriety of any agitation of to|pics on the origin and primary rights of government, in oppo&s;ition to their private &s;entiments, might po&s;|&s;ibly be doubted. But as it is notorious, that they were proceeding as fa&s;t, and as far, as time and circum&s;tan|ces would admit, both in their di&s;cu&s;&s;ions and cabals&mdash;as it is not to be denied, that they had opened a cor|re&s;pondence with a foreign faction, the mo&s;t wicked the world ever &s;aw, and e&s;tabli&s;hed anniver&s;aries to commemorate the mo&s;t mon&s;trous, cruel, and per|fidious of all the proceedings of that faction&mdash;the que&s;tion is, whether their conduct was to be re|garded in &s;ilence, le&s;t our interference &s;hould render them outrageous? Then let them deal as they plea&s;e with the con&s;titution. Let the lady be pa&s;|&s;ive, le&s;t the ravi&s;her &s;hould be driven to force. Re&s;i&s;tance will only increa&s;e his de&s;ires. Yes, truly, if the re&s;i&s;tance be feigned and feeble. But they who are wedded to the con&s;titution will not act the part of wittols. They will drive &s;uch &s;e|ducers from the hou&s;e on the fir&s;t appearance of their love-letters, and offered a&s;&s;ignations. But if the author of the Reflections, though a vigilant, was not a di&s;creet guardian of the con&s;titution, let them who have the &s;ame regard to it, &s;hew them&s;elves as vigilant and more &s;kilful in repelling the attacks of &s;eduction or violence. Their freedom from jealou&s;y is equivocal, and may ari&s;e as well from indifference to the object, as confidence in her virtue. On their principle, it is the re&s;i&s;tance, and not the a&s;&s;ault, which produces the danger. I admit, indeed, that if we e&s;timated the danger by the value of the writings, it would be little worthy of our attention: contemptible

the&s;e writings are in every &s;en&s;e. But they are not the cau&s;e, but the di&s;gu&s;ting &s;ymptoms, of a frightful di&s;temper. They are not otherwi&s;e of con&s;equence, than as they &s;hew the evil habit of the bodies from whence they come. In that light the meane&s;t of them is a &s;erious thing. If however I &s;hould under-rate them; and that they are not the re&s;ult, but the cau&s;e of the di&s;orders I &s;peak of, &s;till tho&s;e who circulate operative poi&s;ons, and give, to what|ever force they have by their nature, the further operation of their authority and adoption, are much to be cen&s;ured, watched, and, if po&s;&s;ible, repre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>At what di&s;tance the direct danger from &s;uch factions may be, it is not ea&s;y to fix. An adapta|tion of circum&s;tances to de&s;igns and principles is ne|ce&s;&s;ary. But the&s;e cannot be wanting for any long time in the ordinary cour&s;e of &s;ublunary affairs. Great di&s;contents frequently ari&s;e in the be&s;t-con&s;ti|tuted governments, from cau&s;es which no human wi&s;dom can fore&s;ee, and no human power can pre|vent. They occur at uncertain periods, but at pe|riods which are not commonly far a&s;under. Go|vernments of all kinds are admini&s;tered only by men; and great mi&s;takes, tending to inflame the&s;e di&s;|contents, may concur. The indeci&s;ion of tho&s;e who happen to rule at the critical time, their &s;upine ne|glect, or their precipitate and ill-judged attention, may aggravate the public misfortunes. In &s;uch a &s;tate of things, the principles, now only &s;own, will &s;hoot out and vegetate in full luxuriance. In &s;uch circum&s;tances the minds of the people become &s;ore and ulcerated. They are put out of humour with all public men, and all public parties; they are fatigued with their di&s;&s;en&s;ions; they are irritated at their coali|tions; they are made ea&s;ily to believe, (what much pains are taken to make them believe) that all oppo|&s;itions are factious, and all courtiers ba&s;e and &s;ervile. From their di&s;gu&s;t at men, they are &s;oon led to quar|rel

with their frame of government, which they pre&s;ume gives nouri&s;hment to the vices, real or &s;uppo&s;ed, of tho&s;e who admini&s;ter in it. Mi&s;|taking malignity for &s;agacity, they are &s;oon led to ca&s;t off all hope from a good admini&s;tration of affairs, and come to think that all reformation depends, not on a change of actors, but upon an alteration in the machinery. Then will be felt the full effect of en|couraging doctrines which tend to make the citi|zens de&s;pi&s;e their con&s;titution. Then will be felt the plenitude of the mi&s;chief of teaching the people to believe, that all antient in&s;titutions are the re&s;ults of ignorance; and that all pre&s;criptive government is in its nature u&s;urpation. Then will be felt, in all its energy, the danger of encouraging a &s;pirit of litigation in per&s;ons of that immature and imper|fect &s;tate of knowledge which &s;erves to render them &s;u&s;ceptible of doubts but incapable of their &s;olution. Then will be felt, in all its aggravation, the per|nicious con&s;equence of de&s;troying all docility in the minds of tho&s;e who are not formed for finding their own way in the labyrinths of political theory, and are made to reject the clue, and to di&s;dain the guide. Then will be felt, and too late will be acknow|ledged, the ruin which follows the disjoining of re|ligion from the &s;tate; the &s;eparation of morality from policy; and the giving con&s;cience no concern and no coactive or coercive force in the mo&s;t mate|rial of all the &s;ocial ties, the principle of our obliga|tions to government.</P>
<P>I know too, that be&s;ides this vain, contradic|tory, and &s;elf-de&s;tructive &s;ecurity, which &s;ome men derive from the habitual attachment of the peo|ple to this con&s;titution, whil&s;t they &s;uffer it with a &s;ort of &s;portive acquie&s;cence to be brought into contempt before their faces, they have other grounds for removing all apprehen&s;ion from their minds. They are of opinion, that there are too many men

of great hereditary e&s;tates and influence in the king|dom, to &s;uffer the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the levelling &s;y&s;tem which has taken place in France. This is very true, if in order to guide the power, which now attends their property, the&s;e men po&s;&s;e&s;s the wi&s;dom which is involved in early fear. But if through a &s;upine &s;ecurity, to which &s;uch fortunes are peculiarly liable, they neglect the u&s;e of their influence in the &s;ea&s;on of their power, on the fir&s;t derangement of &s;ociety, the nerves of their &s;trength will be cut. Their e&s;tates, in&s;tead of being the means of their &s;ecurity, will become the very cau&s;es of their danger. In&s;tead of be&s;towing influence they will excite rapacity. They will be looked to as a prey.</P>
<P>Such will be the impotent condition of tho&s;e men of great hereditary e&s;tates, who indeed di&s;like the de|&s;igns that are carried on, but who&s;e di&s;like is rather that of &s;pectators, than of parties that may be con|cerned in the cata&s;trophe of the piece. But riches do not in all ca&s;es &s;ecure even an inert and pa&s;&s;ive re|&s;i&s;tance. There are always, in that de&s;cription, men who&s;e fortunes, when their minds are once vitia|ted by pa&s;&s;ion or by evil principle, are by no means a &s;ecurity from their actually taking their part again&s;t the public tranquillity. We &s;ee to what low and de&s;picable pa&s;&s;ions of all kinds many men in that cla&s;s are ready to &s;acrifice the patri|monial e&s;tates, which might be perpetuated in their families with &s;plendor, and with the fame of hereditary benefactors to mankind from generation to generation. Do we not &s;ee how lightly people treat their fortunes when under the influence of the pa&s;&s;ion of gaming? The game of ambition or re&s;entment will be played by many of the rich and great, as de&s;perately, and with as much blindne&s;s to the con&s;equences, as any other game. Was he a man of no rank or fortune, who fir&s;t &s;et on foot

the di&s;turbances which have ruined France? Pa&s;|&s;ion blinded him to the con&s;equences, &s;o far as they concerned him&s;elf; and as to the con&s;equences with regard to others, they were no part of his con&s;i|deration; nor ever will be with tho&s;e who bear any re&s;emblance to that virtuous patriot and lover of the rights of man.</P>
<P>There is al&s;o a time of in&s;ecurity, when in|tere&s;ts of all &s;orts become objects of &s;peculation. Then it is, that their very attachment to wealth and importance will induce &s;everal per&s;ons of opulence to li&s;t them&s;elves, and even to take a lead with the party which they think mo&s;t likely to prevail, in order to obtain to them&s;elves con&s;ideration in &s;ome new order or di&s;order of things. They may be led to act in this manner, that they may &s;ecure &s;ome portion of their own property; and perhaps to be|come partakers of the &s;poil of their own order. Tho&s;e who &s;peculate on change, always make a great number among people of rank and fortune, as well as among&s;t the low and the indigent.</P>
<P>What &s;ecurity again&s;t all this?&mdash;All human &s;ecu|rities are liable to uncertainty. But if any thing bids fair for the prevention of &s;o great a calamity, it mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t in the u&s;e of the ordinary means of ju&s;t influence in &s;ociety, whil&s;t tho&s;e means conti|nue unimpaired. The public judgment ought to re|ceive a proper direction. All weighty men may have their &s;hare in &s;o good a work. As yet, not|with&s;tanding the &s;trutting and lying independence of a braggart philo&s;ophy, nature maintains her rights, and great names have great prevalence. Two &s;uch men as Mr. Pitt and Mr. Fox, adding to their authority in a point in which they concur, even by their di&s;union in every thing el&s;e, might frown the&s;e wicked opinions out of the kingdom. But if the influence of either of them, or the influ|ence of men like them, &s;hould, again&s;t their &s;erious
<PB N="111" REF="112">
intentions, be otherwi&s;e perverted, they may counte|nance opinions which (as I have &s;aid before, and could wi&s;h over and over again to pre&s;s) they may in vain attempt to control. In their theory, the&s;e doctrines admit no limit, no qualification what&s;oever. No man can &s;ay how far he will go, who joins with tho&s;e who are avowedly going to the utmo&s;t extremities. What &s;ecurity is there for &s;topping &s;hort at all in the&s;e wild conceits? Why, neither more nor le&s;s than this&mdash;that the mo|ral &s;entiments of &s;ome few among&s;t them do put &s;ome check on their &s;avage theories. But let us take care. The moral &s;entiments, &s;o nearly con|nected with early prejudice as to be almo&s;t one and the &s;ame thing, will a&s;&s;uredly not live long under a di&s;cipline, which has for its ba&s;is the de&s;truction of all prejudices, and the making the mind proof again&s;t all dread of con&s;equences flowing from the pretended truths that are taught by their philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>In this &s;chool the moral &s;entiments mu&s;t grow weaker and weaker every day. The more cautious of the&s;e teachers, in laying down their maxims, draw as much of the conclu&s;ion as &s;uits, not with their premi&s;es, but with their policy. They tru&s;t the re&s;t to the &s;agacity of their pupils. Others, and the&s;e are the mo&s;t vaunted for their &s;pirit, not only lay down the &s;ame premi&s;es, but boldly draw the conclu&s;ions to the de&s;truction of our whole con&s;titution in church and &s;tate. But are the&s;e conclu&s;ions truly drawn? Yes, mo&s;t cer|tainly. Their principles are wild and wicked. But let ju&s;tice be done even to phren&s;y and villainy. The&s;e teachers are perfectly &s;y&s;tematic. No man who a&s;&s;umes their grounds can tolerate the Briti&s;h con&s;titution in church or &s;tate. The&s;e teachers profe&s;s to &s;corn all mediocrity; to engage for per|fection; to proceed by the &s;imple&s;t and &s;horte&s;t cour&s;e. They build their politics, not on conve|nience
<PB N="112" REF="113">
but on truth; and they profe&s;s to conduct men to certain happine&s;s by the a&s;&s;ertion of their undoubted rights. With them there is no com|promi&s;e. All other governments are u&s;urpations, which ju&s;tify and even demand re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Their principles always go to the extreme. They who go with the principles of the ancient Whigs, which are tho&s;e contained in Mr. Burke's book, never can go too far. They may indeed &s;top &s;hort of &s;ome hazardous and ambiguous excellence, which they will be taught to po&s;tpone to any rea&s;onable degree of good they may actually po&s;&s;e&s;s. They will be taught that in every action of importance a duty is included. The opinions maintained in that book never can lead to an extreme, becau&s;e their foundation is laid in an oppo&s;ition to extremes. The foundation of govern|ment is there laid, not in imaginary rights of men, (which at be&s;t is a confu&s;ion of judicial with civil principles) but in political convenience, and in human nature; either as that nature is univer&s;al, or as it is modified by local habits and &s;ocial aptitudes. The foundation of government, (tho&s;e who have read that book will recollect) is laid in a provi&s;ion for our wants, and in a conformity to our duties; it is to purvey for the one; it is to enforce the other. The&s;e doctrines do of them&s;elves gravitate to a mid|dle point, or to &s;ome point near a middle. They &s;uppo&s;e indeed a certain portion of liberty to be e&s;&s;en|tial to all good government; but they infer that this liberty is to be blended into the government; to harmonize with its forms and its rules; and to be made &s;ubordinate to its end. Tho&s;e who are not with that book are with its oppo&s;ite. For there is no medium be&s;ides the medium it&s;elf. That medium is not &s;uch, becau&s;e it is found there; but it is found there, becau&s;e it is conformable to truth and nature. In this we do not follow the author; but we and the author travel together upon the &s;ame &s;afe and middle path.</P>

<P>Place, for in&s;tance, before your eyes, &s;uch a man as Monte&s;quieu. Think of a genius not born in every country, or every time; a man gifted by nature with a penetrating aquiline eye; with a judgment prepared with the mo&s;t exten&s;ive erudition; with an herculean robu&s;tne&s;s of mind, and nerves not to be broken with labour; a man who could &s;pend twenty years in one pur&s;uit. Think of a man, like the univer&s;al patriarch in Milton (who had drawn up before him in his prophetic vi&s;ion the whole &s;eries of the generations which were to i&s;&s;ue from his loins) a man capable of placing in review, after having brought together, from the ea&s;t, the we&s;t, the north, and the &s;outh, from the coar&s;ene&s;s of the rude&s;t bar|bari&s;m to the mo&s;t refined and &s;ubtle civilization, all the &s;chemes of government which had ever prevailed among&s;t mankind, weighing, mea&s;uring, collating, and comparing them all, joining fact with theory, and calling into council, upon all this infinite a&s;&s;em|blage of things, all the &s;peculations which have fa|tigued the under&s;tandings of profound rea&s;oners in all times!&mdash;Let us then con&s;ider, that all the&s;e were but &s;o many preparatory &s;teps to qualify a man, and &s;uch a man, tinctured with no national preju|dice, with no dome&s;tic affection, to admire, and to hold out to the admiration of mankind the con&s;titution of England!

<P><PB N="116" REF="117">
Different from them are all the great critics. They have taught us one e&s;&s;ential rule. I think the excellent and philo&s;ophic arti&s;t a true judge, as well as a perfect follower of nature, Sir Jo&s;hua Reynolds has &s;omewhere applied it, or &s;omething like it, in his own profe&s;&s;ion. It is this, That if ever we &s;hould find our&s;elves di&s;po&s;ed not to admire tho&s;e writers, Livy and Virgil for in&s;tance, whom all the learned had admired, not to follow our own fancies, but to &s;tudy them until we know how and what we ought to admire; and if we cannot arrive at this combination of admiration with knowledge, rather to believe that we are dull, than that the re&s;t of the world has been impo&s;ed on. It is as good a rule, at lea&s;t, with regard to this admired con&s;ti|tution. We ought to under&s;tand it according to our mea&s;ure; and to venerate where we are not able pre&s;ently to comprehend.</P>
<P>Such were our fathers to whom we owe this &s;plendid inheritance. Let us improve it with zeal, but with fear. Let us follow our ance&s;tors, men not without a rational, though without an exclu&s;ive confidence in them&s;elves; who, by re&s;pecting the rea&s;on of others, who, by looking backward as well as forward, by the mode&s;ty as well as by the energy of their minds, went on, in&s;en&s;ibly drawing this con&s;titution nearer and nearer to its perfection by never departing from its fundamental principles, nor introducing any amendment which had not a &s;ub|&s;i&s;ting root in the laws, con&s;titution, and u&s;ages of the kingdom. Let tho&s;e who have the tru&s;t of political or of natural authority ever keep watch again&s;t the de&s;perate enterprizes of innovation: Let even their benevolence be fortified and armed.

vile&s;t of all populace; him&s;elf three times dragged by the&s;e wretches in an infamous triumph; his children torn from him, in violation of the fir&s;t right of nature, and given into the tuition of the mo&s;t de&s;perate and impious of the leaders of de&s;perate and impious clubs; his revenues dilapidated and plundered; his magi&s;trates murdered; his clergy pro&s;cribed, per&s;ecuted, fami&s;hed; his nobility de|graded in their rank, undone in their fortunes, fu|gitives in their per&s;ons; his armies corrupted and ruined; his whole people impoveri&s;hed, di&s;united, di&s;&s;olved; whil&s;t through the bars of his pri&s;on, and amid&s;t the bayonets of his keepers, he hears the tu|mult of two conflicting factions, equally wicked and abandoned, who agree in principles, in di&s;po&s;itions, and in objects, but who tear each other to pieces about the mo&s;t effectual means of obtaining their common end; the one contending to pre&s;erve for a while his name and his per&s;on, the more ea&s;ily to de&s;troy the royal authority&mdash;the other clamouring to cut off the name, the per&s;on, and the monarchy together, by one &s;acrilegious execution. All this accumulation of calamity, the greate&s;t that ever fell upon one man, has fallen upon his head, be|cau&s;e he had left his virtues unguarded by caution; becau&s;e he was not taught that where power is con|cerned, he who will confer benefits mu&s;t take &s;ecu|rity again&s;t ingratitude.</P>

But there is one topic upon which I hope I &s;hall be excu&s;ed in going a little beyond my de&s;ign. The factions, now &s;o bu&s;y among&s;t us, in order to dive&s;t men of all love for their country, and to remove from their minds all duty with re|gard to the &s;tate, endeavour to propagate an opini|on,
<PB N="118" REF="119">
that the <HI>people,</HI> in forming their commonwealth, have by no means parted with their power over it. This is an impregnable citadel, to which the&s;e gen|tlemen retreat whenever they are pu&s;hed by the battery of laws, and u&s;ages, and po&s;itive conven|tions. Indeed it is of &s;uch and of &s;o great force, that all they have done in defending their out|works is &s;o much time and labour thrown away. Di&s;cu&s;s any of their &s;chemes&mdash;their an&s;wer is&mdash;It is the act of the <HI>people,</HI> and that is &s;ufficient. Are we to deny to a <HI>majority</HI> of the people the right of altering even the whole frame of their &s;ociety, if &s;uch &s;hould be their plea&s;ure? They may change it, &s;ay they, from a monarchy to a republic to-day, and to-morrow back again from a republic to a monarchy; and &s;o backward and forward as often as they like. They are ma&s;ters of the common|wealth; becau&s;e in &s;ub&s;tance they are them&s;elves the commonwealth. The French revolution, &s;ay they, was the act of the majority of the people; and if the majority of any other people, the people of England for in&s;tance, wi&s;h to make the &s;ame change, they have the &s;ame right.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t the &s;ame undoubtedly. That is, none at all. Neither the few nor the many have a right to act merely by their will, in any matter connected with duty, tru&s;t, engagement, or obligation. The con&s;titution of a country being once &s;ettled upon &s;ome compact, tacit or expre&s;&s;ed, there is no power exi&s;ting of force to alter it, without the breach of the covenant, or the con&s;ent of all the parties. Such is the nature of a contract. And the votes of a majority of the people, whatever their infamous flatterers may teach in order to corrupt their minds, cannot alter the moral any more than they can alter the phy&s;ical e&s;&s;ence of things. The people are not to be taught to think lightly of their engagements to their go|vernors;
<PB N="119" REF="120">
el&s;e they teach governors to think light|ly of their engagements towards them. In that kind of game in the end the people are &s;ure to be lo&s;ers. To flatter them into a contempt of faith, truth, and ju&s;tice, is to ruin them; for in the&s;e virtues con&s;i&s;ts their whole &s;afety. To flatter any man, or any part of mankind, in any de&s;cription, by a&s;&s;erting, that in engagements he or they are free whil&s;t any other hu|man creature is bound, is ultimately to ve&s;t the rule of morality in the plea&s;ure of tho&s;e who ought to be rigidly &s;ubmitted to it; to &s;ubject the &s;overeign rea|&s;on of the world to the caprices of weak and giddy men.</P>
<P>But, as no one of us men can di&s;pen&s;e with public or private faith, or with any other tie of moral ob|ligation, &s;o neither can any number of us. The number engaged in crimes, in&s;tead of turning them into laudable acts, only augments the quantity and the inten&s;ity of the guilt. I am well aware, that men love to hear of their power, but have an ex|treme di&s;reli&s;h to be told of their duty. This is of cour&s;e; becau&s;e every duty is a limitation of &s;ome power. Indeed arbitrary power is &s;o much to the depraved ta&s;te of the vulgar, of the vulgar of every de&s;cription, that almo&s;t all the di&s;&s;en&s;ions which lacerate the commonwealth, are not concerning the manner in which it is to be exerci&s;ed, but concerning the hands in which it is to be placed. Somewhere they are re&s;olved to have it. Whether they de|&s;ire it to be ve&s;ted in the many or the few, de|pends with mo&s;t men upon the chance which they imagine they them&s;elves may have of partaking in the exerci&s;e of that arbitrary &s;way, in the one mode or in the other.</P>
<P>It is not nece&s;&s;ary to teach men to thir&s;t after power. But it is very expedient that, by moral in&s;truction, they &s;hould be taught, and by their civil con&s;titutions they &s;hould be compelled, to put many
<PB N="120" REF="121">
re&s;trictions upon the immediate exerci&s;e of it, and the inordinate de&s;ire. The be&s;t method of obtaining the&s;e two great points forms the important, but at the &s;ame time the difficult problem to the true &s;tate&s;man. He thinks of the place in which politi|cal power is to be lodged, with no other attention, than as it may render the more or the le&s;s practi|cable, its &s;alutary re&s;traint, and its prudent direc|tion. For this rea&s;on no legi&s;lator, at any period of the world, has willingly placed the &s;eat of active power in the hands of the multitude: Becau&s;e there it admits of no control, no regulation, no &s;teady direction what&s;oever. The people are the natural control on authority; but to exerci&s;e and to control together is contradictory and impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As the exorbitant exerci&s;e of power cannot, un|der popular &s;way, be effectually re&s;trained, the other great object of political arrangement, the means of abating an exce&s;&s;ive de&s;ire of it, is in &s;uch a &s;tate &s;till wor&s;e provided for. The democratick com|monwealth is the foodful nur&s;e of ambition. Un|der the other forms it meets with many re&s;traints. Whenever, in &s;tates which have had a democratick ba&s;is, they have endeavoured to put re&s;traints upon ambition, their methods were as violent, as in the end they were ineffectual; as violent indeed as any the mo&s;t jealous de&s;poti&s;m could invent. The o&s;traci&s;m could not very long &s;ave it&s;elf, and much le&s;s the &s;tate which it was meant to guard, from the attempts of ambition, one of the natural inbred in|curable di&s;tempers of a powerful democracy.</P>
<P>But to return from this &s;hort digre&s;&s;ion, which however is not wholly foreign to the que&s;tion of the effect of the will of the majority upon the form or the exi&s;tence of their &s;ociety. I cannot too often recommend it to the &s;erious con&s;ideration of all men, who think civil &s;ociety to be within the pro|vince of moral juri&s;diction, that if we owe to it any
<PB N="121" REF="122">
duty, it is not &s;ubject to our will. Duties are not voluntary. Duty and will are even contradictory terms. Now though &s;ociety might be at fir&s;t a voluntary act (which in many ca&s;es it undoubtedly was) its continuance is a covenant. Men without their choice derive benefits from it, without their will are &s;ubjected to duties, and enter into a virtual obligation as binding as any that is actual; indeed more &s;o, as we derive from it benefits of much lon|ger continuance, and much greater and more e&s;|&s;ential than the fir&s;t contracting parties could have obtained from their agreement. Indeed much the greate&s;t and &s;tronge&s;t moral obligations are &s;uch as were never the re&s;ults of our choice. If indeed there exi&s;ts no &s;upreme ruler, wi&s;e to form and potent to enforce the moral law, I know of no &s;anction to any contract, actual or virtual, again&s;t the will of prevalent power. The fir&s;t que&s;tion decides upon the la&s;t. Into that que&s;tion indeed all the re&s;t re&s;olve themelves ultimately. We have but this one appeal again&s;t irre&s;i&s;tible power:</P>

<P>Taking it for granted that I do not write to the di&s;ciples of the Pari&s;ian philo&s;ophy, I may a&s;&s;ume, that the awful author of our being is the author of our place in the order of exi&s;tence; and that having di&s;|po&s;ed and mar&s;halled us by a divine tactick, not ac|cording to our will, but according to his, he has, in and by that di&s;po&s;ition, virtually &s;ubjected us to act the part which belongs to the place a&s;&s;igned us. We have obligations to mankind at large, which are not in con&s;equence of any &s;pecial voluntary pact. On the contrary, the force of all the pacts which we enter into with any of them, depends upon tho&s;e prior ob|ligations. When we marry, the choice is voluntary, but the duties are not matter of choice. They are
<PB N="122" REF="123">
dictated by the nature of the &s;ituation. Dark and in&s;crutable are the ways by which we come into the world. The in&s;tincts which give ri&s;e to this my&s;|terious proce&s;s of nature are not of our making. But out of phy&s;ical cau&s;es, unknown to us, perhaps unknowable, ari&s;e moral duties, which, as we are able perfectly to comprehend, we are bound indi&s;|pen&s;ably to perform. Children are not con&s;enting to their relation, but their relation, without their actual con&s;ent, binds them to its duties; or rather it implies their con&s;ent, becau&s;e the pre&s;umed con&s;ent of a rational creature is in uni&s;on with the predi&s;|po&s;ed order of things. Men come in that manner into a community with the &s;ocial &s;tate of their pa|rents, endowed with all the benefits, loaded with all the duties of their &s;ituation. If the &s;ocial ties and ligaments, &s;pun out of tho&s;e relations which are the elements of the commonwealth, in mo&s;t ca&s;es begin, and always continue independently of our will, &s;o does that relation called our country, which comprehends (as it has been well &s;aid) <Q>&startq;all the charities of all,&endq;</Q> bind us to it without any &s;ti|pulation on our part. Nor are we left without powerful in&s;tincts to make this duty as dear and grateful to us, as it is awful and coercive. Our country is not a thing of mere phy&s;ical locality. It con&s;i&s;ts, in a great mea&s;ure, in the antient order into which we are born. We may have the &s;ame geographical &s;ituation, but another country; as we may have the &s;ame country in another &s;oil. The place that determines our duty is a &s;ocial, civil relation.</P>

<P>I admit, indeed, that in morals, as in all things el&s;e, difficulties will &s;ometimes occur. Duties will &s;ometimes cro&s;s one another. Then que&s;tions will ari&s;e, which of them is to be placed in &s;ubordina|tion; which of them may be entirely &s;uper&s;eded? The&s;e doubts give ri&s;e to that part of moral &s;ci|ence called <HI>ca&s;ui&s;try;</HI> which, though nece&s;&s;ary to be well &s;tudied by tho&s;e who would become expert in that learning, who aim at becoming what, I think Cicero &s;omewhere calls, <HI>artifices officiorum;</HI> it re|quires a very &s;olid and di&s;criminating judgment, great mode&s;ty and caution, and much &s;obriety of mind in the handling; el&s;e there is a danger that it may totally &s;ubvert tho&s;e offices which it is its object only to methodize and reconcile. Duties, at their extreme bounds, are drawn very fine, &s;o as to become almo&s;t evane&s;cent. In that &s;tate, &s;ome &s;hade of doubt will always re&s;t on the&s;e que&s;tions, when they are pur&s;ued with great &s;ubtilty. But the
<PB N="124" REF="125">
very habit of &s;tating the&s;e extreme ca&s;es is not very laudable or &s;afe: becau&s;e, in general, it is not right to turn our duties into doubts. They are impo&s;ed to govern our conduct, not to exerci&s;e our ingenuity; and therefore, our opinions about them ought not to be in a &s;tate of fluctuation, but &s;teady, &s;ure, and re&s;olved.</P>
<P>Among&s;t the&s;e nice, and therefore dangerous, points of ca&s;ui&s;try may be reckoned the que&s;tion &s;o much agitated in the pre&s;ent hour&mdash;Whether, after the people have di&s;charged them&s;elves of their original power by an habitual delegation, no occa|&s;ion can po&s;&s;ibly occur which may ju&s;tify their re|&s;umption of it? This que&s;tion, in this latitude, is very hard to affirm or deny: but I am &s;atisfied that no occa&s;ion can ju&s;tify &s;uch a re&s;umption, which would not equally authorize a di&s;pen&s;ation with any other moral duty, perhaps with all of them together. However, if in general it be not ea&s;y to determine concerning the lawfulne&s;s of &s;uch devious proceedings, which mu&s;t be ever on the edge of crimes, it is far from difficult to fore&s;ee the perilous con&s;equences of the re&s;u&s;cita|tion of &s;uch a power in the people. The practical con&s;equences of any political tenet go a great way in deciding upon its value. Political problems do not primarily concern truth or fal&s;ehood. They relate to good or evil. What in the re&s;ult is likely to produce evil, is politically fal&s;e: that which is productive of good, politically is true.</P>
<P>Believing it therefore a que&s;tion at lea&s;t ar|duous in the theory, and in the practice very critical, it would well become us to a&s;certain, as well as we can, what form it is that our incantations are about to call up from darkne&s;s and the &s;leep of ages. When the &s;upreme authority of the people is in que&s;tion, before we attempt to extend or to confine it, we ought to fix in our minds, with &s;ome degree
<PB N="125" REF="126">
of di&s;tinctne&s;s, an idea of what it is we mean when we &s;ay the PEOPLE.</P>
<P>In a &s;tate of <HI>rude</HI> nature there is no &s;uch thing as a people. A number of men in them&s;elves have no collective capacity. The idea of a people is the idea of a corporation. It is wholly artificial; and made like all other legal fictions by common agreement. What the particular nature of that agreement was, is collected from the form into which the particular &s;ociety has been ca&s;t. Any other is not their covenant. When men, there|fore, break up the original compact or agreement which gives its corporate form and capacity to a &s;tate, they are no longer a people; they have no longer a corporate exi&s;tence; they have no longer a legal coactive force to bind within, nor a claim to be recognized abroad. They are a number of vague loo&s;e individuals, and nothing more. With them all is to begin again. Alas! they little know how many a weary &s;tep is to be taken before they can form them&s;elves into a ma&s;s, which has a true politic per&s;onality.</P>
<P>We hear much from men, who have not ac|quired their hardine&s;s of a&s;&s;ertion from the profun|dity of their thinking, about the omnipotence of a <HI>majority,</HI> in &s;uch a di&s;&s;olution of an ancient &s;ociety as hath taken place in France. But among&s;t men &s;o di&s;banded, there can be no &s;uch thing as majority or minority; or power in any one per&s;on to bind another. The power of acting by a majority, which the gentle|men theori&s;ts &s;eem to a&s;&s;ume &s;o readily, after they have violated the contract out of which it has ari&s;en, (if at all it exi&s;ted) mu&s;t be grounded on two a&s;&s;ump|tions; fir&s;t, that of an incorporation produced by unanimity; and &s;econdly, an unanimous agreement, that the act of a mere majority (&s;ay of one) &s;hall pa&s;s with them and with others as the act of the whole.</P>
<P>We are &s;o little affected by things which are habi|tual,
<PB N="126" REF="127">
that we con&s;ider this idea of the deci&s;ion of a <HI>ma|jority</HI> as if it were a law of our original nature: But &s;uch con&s;tructive whole, re&s;iding in a part only, is one of the mo&s;t violent fictions of po&s;itive law, that ever has been or can be made on the principles of artifi|cial incorporation. Out of civil &s;ociety nature knows nothing of it; nor are men, even when arranged ac|cording to civil order, otherwi&s;e than by very long training, brought at all to &s;ubmit to it. The mind is brought far more ea&s;ily to acquie&s;ce in the pro|ceedings of one man, or a few, who act under a general procuration for the &s;tate, than in the vote of a victorious majority in councils in which every man has his &s;hare in the deliberation. For there the beaten party are exa&s;perated and &s;our|ed by the previous contention, and mortified by the conclu&s;ive defeat. This mode of deci&s;ion, where wills may be &s;o nearly equal, where, ac|cording to circum&s;tances, the &s;maller number may be the &s;tronger force, and where apparent rea&s;on may be all upon one &s;ide, and on the other little el&s;e than impetuous appetite; all this mu&s;t be the re&s;ult of a very particular and &s;pecial convention, confirmed afterwards by long habits of obedience, by a &s;ort of di&s;cipline in &s;ociety, and by a &s;trong hand, ve&s;ted with &s;tationary permanent power, to enforce this &s;ort of con&s;tructive general will. What organ it is that &s;hall declare the corporate mind is &s;o much a matter of po&s;itive arrangement, that &s;everal &s;tates, for the validity of &s;everal of their acts, have required a pro|portion of voices much greater than that of a mere majority. The&s;e proportions are &s;o entirely governed by convention, that in &s;ome ca&s;es the minority decides. The laws in many countries to <HI>condemn</HI> require more than a mere majority; le&s;s than an equal number to <HI>acquit.</HI> In our judicial trials we require unani|mity either to condemn or to ab&s;olve. In &s;ome in|corporations one man &s;peaks for the whole; in
<PB N="127" REF="128">
others, a few. Until the other day, in the con&s;ti|tution of Poland, unanimity was required to give validity to any act of their great national council or diet. This approaches much more nearly to rude nature than the in&s;titutions of any other country. Such, indeed, every commonwealth mu&s;t be, with|out a po&s;itive law to recognize in a certain number the will of the entire body.</P>
<P>If men di&s;&s;olve their antient incorporation, in or|der to regenerate their community, in that &s;tate of things each man has a right, if he plea&s;es, to re|main an individual. Any number of individuals, who can agree upon it, have an undoubted right to form them&s;elves into a &s;tate apart and wholly inde|pendent. If any of the&s;e is forced into the fellow|&s;hip of another, this is conque&s;t and not compact. On every principle, which &s;uppo&s;es &s;ociety to be in virtue of a free covenant, this compul&s;ive incorpo|ration mu&s;t be null and void.</P>
<P>As a people can have no right to a corporate ca|pacity without univer&s;al con&s;ent, &s;o neither have they a right to hold exclu&s;ively any lands in the name and title of a corporation. On the &s;cheme of the pre|&s;ent rulers in our neighbouring country, regenerated as they are, they have no more right to the ter|ritory called France than I have. I have a right to pitch my tent in any unoccupied place I can find for it; and I may apply to my own maintenance any part of their unoccupied &s;oil. I may purcha&s;e the hou&s;e or vineyard of any individual proprietor who refu&s;es his con&s;ent (and mo&s;t proprietors have, as far as they dared, refu&s;ed it) to the new incorpo|ration. I &s;tand in his independent place. Who are the&s;e in&s;olent men calling them&s;elves the French nation, that would monopolize this fair domain of nature? Is it becau&s;e they &s;peak a certain jargon? Is it their mode of chattering, to me unintelli|gible,
<PB N="128" REF="129">
that forms their title to my land? Who are they who claim by pre&s;cription and de&s;cent from certain gangs of banditti called Franks, and Burgundians, and Vi&s;igoths, of whom I may have never heard, and ninety-nine out of an hundred of them&s;elves certainly never have heard; whil&s;t at the very time they tell me, that pre&s;cription and long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion form no title to property? Who are they that pre&s;ume to a&s;&s;ert that the land which I purcha&s;ed of the individual, a natural per&s;on, and not a fiction of &s;tate, belongs to them, who in the very capacity in which they make their claim can exi&s;t only as an imaginary being, and in virtue of the very pre&s;cription which they reject and di&s;own? This mode of arguing might be pu&s;hed into all the detail, &s;o as to leave no &s;ort of doubt, that on their principles, and on the &s;ort of footing on which they have thought proper to place them&s;elves, the crowd of men on the other &s;ide of the channel, who have the impudence to call them&s;elves a people, can never be the lawful exclu&s;ive po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ors of the &s;oil. By what they call rea&s;oning without prejudice, they leave not one &s;tone upon another in the fabric of human &s;ociety. They &s;ub|vert all the authority which they hold, as well as all that which they have de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>As in the ab&s;tract, it is perfectly clear, that, out of a &s;tate of civil &s;ociety, majority and minority are re|lations which can have no exi&s;tence; and that in civil &s;ociety, its own &s;pecific conventions in each incor|poration, determine what it is that con&s;titutes the people, &s;o as to make their act the &s;ignification of the general will, &s;o it is, in particular, equally clear, that neither in France nor in England has the ori|ginal, or any &s;ub&s;equent compact of the &s;tate, ex|pre&s;&s;ed or implied, con&s;tituted <HI>a majority of men, told by the head,</HI> to be the acting people of their &s;everal
<PB N="129" REF="130">
communities. And I &s;ee as little of policy or uti|lity as there is of right, in laying down a principle that a majority of men told by the head are to be con&s;idered as the people, and that as &s;uch their will is to be law. What policy can there be found in arrangements made in defiance of every political principle? To enable men to act with the weight and character of a people, and to an&s;wer the ends for which they are incorporated into that capacity, we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e them (by means immediate or con&s;e|quential) to be in that &s;tate of habitual &s;ocial di&s;ci|pline, in which the wi&s;er, the more expert, and the more opulent, conduct, and by conducting enlighten and protect the weaker, the le&s;s knowing, and the le&s;s provided with the goods of fortune. When the mul|titude are not under this di&s;cipline, they can &s;carcely be &s;aid to be in civil &s;ociety. Give once a certain con&s;titution of things, which produces a variety of conditions and circum&s;tances in a &s;tate, and there is in nature and rea&s;on a principle which, for their own benefit, po&s;tpones, not the intere&s;t but the judgment, of tho&s;e who are <HI>numero plures,</HI> to tho&s;e who are <HI>vir|tute et honore minores.</HI> Numbers in a &s;tate (&s;uppo&s;ing, which is not the ca&s;e of the French, that a &s;tate does exi&s;t) are always of con&s;ideration&mdash;but they are not the whole con&s;ideration.

<P>A true natural ari&s;tocracy is not a &s;eparate intere&s;t in the &s;tate, or &s;eparable from it. It is an e&s;&s;ential integrant part of any large people rightly con&s;ti|tuted. It is formed out of a cla&s;s of legitimate pre&s;umptions, which, taken as generalities, mu&s;t be admitted for actual truths.

<P>The &s;tate of civil &s;ociety, which nece&s;&s;arily ge|nerates this ari&s;tocracy, is a &s;tate of nature; and much more truly &s;o than a &s;avage and incoherent mode of life; for man is by nature rea&s;onable, and he is never perfectly in his natural &s;tate, but when he is placed where rea&s;on may be be&s;t cultivated, and mo&s;t predominates. Art is man's nature. We are as much, at lea&s;t, in a &s;tate of nature in formed manhood, as in immature and helple&s;s infancy. To

give no more importance, in the &s;ocial order, to &s;uch de&s;criptions of men as I have &s;tated, than that of &s;o many units, is an horrible u&s;urpation. Men &s;o qua|lified form in nature, as &s;he operates in the common modification of &s;ociety, the leading, guiding, and governing part. It is the &s;oul to the body, without which the man does not exi&s;t.</P>
<P>When great multitudes act together, under that di&s;cipline of nature, I recognize the PEOPLE. I acknowledge &s;omething that perhaps equals, and ought always to guide, the &s;overeignty of conven|tion. In all things the voice of this grand chorus of national harmony ought to have a mighty and deci&s;ive influence. But when you di&s;turb this har|mony; when you break up this beautiful order, this array of truth and nature, as well as of habit and prejudice; when you &s;eparate the common &s;ort of men from their proper chieftains &s;o as to form them into an adver&s;e army, I no longer know that venerable object called the people in &s;uch a di&s;|banded race of de&s;erters and vagabonds. For a while they may be terrible indeed; but in &s;uch a manner as wild bea&s;ts are terrible. The mind owes to them no &s;ort of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. They are, as they have always been reputed, rebels. They may law|fully be fought with, and brought under, when|ever an advantage offers. Tho&s;e who attempt by outrage and violence to deprive men of any ad|vantage which they hold under the laws, and to de&s;troy the order of life, proclaim war again&s;t them.</P>
<P>We have read in hi&s;tory of that furious in&s;urrec|tion of the common people in France called the <HI>Jacquerie;</HI> for this is not the fir&s;t time that the people have been enlightened into trea&s;on, murder, and rapine. Its object was to extirpate the gentry.

the&s;e deluded wretches: It was, however, his right and his duty to make war upon them, and after|wards, in moderation, to bring them to puni&s;hment for their rebellion; though in the &s;en&s;e of the French revolution, and of &s;ome of our clubs, they were the <HI>people;</HI> and were truly &s;o, if you will call by that appellation <HI>any majority of men told by the head.</HI></P>
<P>At a time not very remote from the &s;ame pe|riod (for the&s;e humours never have affected one of the nations without &s;ome influence on the other) happened &s;everal ri&s;ings of the lower commons in England. The&s;e in&s;urgents were certainly the ma|jority of the inhabitants of the counties in which they re&s;ided; and Cade, Ket, and Straw, at the head of their national guards, and fomented by cer|tain traitors of high rank, did no more than exert, according to the doctrines of ours and the Pari&s;ian &s;ocieties, the &s;overeign power inherent in the ma|jority.</P>
<P>We call the time of tho&s;e events a dark age. Indeed we are too indulgent to our own profici|ency. The Abb&eacute; John Ball under&s;tood the rights of man as well as the Abb&eacute; Gregoire. That reverend patriarch of &s;edition, and prototype of our modern preachers, was of opinion with the national a&s;&s;em|bly, that all the evils which have fallen upon men had been cau&s;ed by an ignorance of their <Q>&startq;having been born and continued equal as to their rights.&endq;</Q> Had the populace been able to repeat that profound maxim all would have gone perfectly well with them. No tyranny, no vexation, no oppre&s;&s;ion, no care, no &s;orrow, could have exi&s;ted in the world. This would have cured them like a charm for the tooth-ach. But the lowe&s;t wretches, in their mo&s;t ignorant &s;tate, were able at all times to talk &s;uch &s;tuff; and yet at all times have they &s;uffered many evils and many oppre&s;&s;ions, both before and &s;ince the republication by the national a&s;&s;embly of this
<PB N="133" REF="134">
&s;pell of healing potency and virtue. The enlighten|ed Dr. Ball, when he wi&s;hed to rekindle the lights and fires of his audience on this point, cho&s;e for the text the following couplet:
<Q><L>When Adam delved and Eve &s;pan,</L>
<L>Who was then the gentleman?</L></Q>
Of this &s;apient maxim, however, I do not give him for the inventor. It &s;eems to have been handed down by tradition, and to have been in &s;ome &s;ort proverbial; but whether then compo&s;ed, or only ap|plied, thus much mu&s;t be admitted, that in learning, &s;en&s;e, energy, and comprehen&s;ivene&s;s, it is fully equal to all the modern di&s;&s;ertations on the equality of mankind; and it has one advantage over them,&mdash;that it is in rhyme.</P>
<P>There is no doubt, but that this great teacher of the rights of man decorated his di&s;cour&s;e on this valuable text, with lemmas, theorems, &s;cholia, corollaries, and all the apparatus of &s;cience, which was furni&s;hed in as great plenty and perfection out of the dogmatic and polemic magazines, the old hor&s;e-armory, of the &s;choolmen, among whom the Rev. Dr. Ball was bred, as they can be &s;upplied from the new ar&s;enal at Hackney. It was no doubt di&s;po&s;ed with all the adjutancy of definition and divi&s;ion, in which (I &s;peak it with &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion) the old mar&s;hals were as able as the modern martinets. Neither can we deny, that the philo&s;o|phic auditory, when they had once obtained this knowledge, could never return to their former ig|norance; or after &s;o in&s;tructive a lecture be in the &s;ame &s;tate of mind as if they had never heard it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the wi&s;e remark on this &s;ubject, in the Defence of Rights of Man, circulated by the &s;ocieties.</NOTE>. But the&s;e poor people, who were not to be envied
<PB N="134" REF="135">
for their knowledge, but pitied for their delu&s;ion, were not rea&s;oned (that was impo&s;&s;ible) but beaten out of their lights. With their teacher they were delivered over to the lawyers; who wrote in their blood the &s;tatutes of the land, as har&s;hly, and in the &s;ame &s;ort of ink, as they and their teachers had written the rights of man.</P>
<P>Our doctors of the day are not &s;o fond of quoting the opinions of this antient &s;age as they are of imitating his conduct; Fir&s;t, becau&s;e it might ap|pear, that they are not as great inventors as they would be thought; and next, becau&s;e, unfortunately for his fame, he was not &s;ucce&s;sful. It is a remark, liable to as few exceptions as any generality can be, that they who applaud pro&s;perous folly, and adore triumphant guilt, have never been known to &s;uc|cour or even to pity human weakne&s;s or offence when they become &s;ubject to human vici&s;&s;itude, and meet with puni&s;hment in&s;tead of obtaining power. Abating for their want of &s;en&s;ibility to the &s;ufferings of their a&s;&s;ociates, they are not &s;o much in the wrong: for madne&s;s and wickedne&s;s are things foul and deformed in them&s;elves; and &s;tand in need of all the coverings and trappings of fortune to recommend them to the multitude. Nothing can be more loath&s;ome in their naked nature.</P>
<P>Aberrations like the&s;e, whether antient or mo|dern, un&s;ucce&s;sful or pro&s;perous, are things of pa&s;|&s;age. They furni&s;h no argument for &s;uppo&s;ing <HI>a multitude told by the head to be the people.</HI> Such a multitude can have no &s;ort of title to alter the &s;eat of power in the &s;ociety, in which it ever ought to be the obedient, and not the ruling or pre&s;id|ing part. What power may belong to the whole ma&s;s, in which ma&s;s, the natural <HI>ari&s;tocracy,</HI> or what by convention is appointed to repre&s;ent and &s;trengthen it, acts in its proper place, with its proper weight, and without being &s;ubjected to violence, is
<PB N="135" REF="136">
a deeper que&s;tion. But in that ca&s;e, and with that concurrence, I &s;hould have much doubt whether any ra&s;h or de&s;perate changes in the &s;tate, &s;uch as we have &s;een in France, could ever be effected.</P>
<P>I have &s;aid, that in all political que&s;tions the con&s;equences of any a&s;&s;umed rights are of great moment in deciding upon their validity. In this point of view let us a little &s;crutinize the effects of a right in the mere majority of the inhabitants of any country of &s;uper&s;eding and altering their government <HI>at plea&s;ure.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;um total of every people is compo&s;ed of its units. Every individual mu&s;t have a right to ori|ginate what afterwards is to become the act of the majority. Whatever he may lawfully originate, he may lawfully endeavour to accompli&s;h. He has a right therefore in his own particular to break the ties and engagement which bind him to the country in which he lives; and he has a right to make as many converts to his opinions, and to obtain as many a&s;&s;ociates in his de&s;igns, as he can pro|cure: For how can you know the di&s;po&s;itions of the majority to de&s;troy their government, but by tampering with &s;ome part of the body? You mu&s;t begin by a &s;ecret con&s;piracy, that you may end with a national confederation. The mere plea&s;ure of the beginner mu&s;t be the &s;ole guide; &s;ince the mere plea&s;ure of others mu&s;t be the &s;ole ultimate &s;anction, as well as the &s;ole actuating prin|ciple in every part of the progre&s;s. Thus arbi|trary will (the la&s;t corruption of ruling power) &s;tep by &s;tep, poi&s;ons the heart of every citizen. If the undertaker fails, he has the misfortune of a rebel, but not the guilt. By &s;uch doctrines, all love to our country, all pious veneration and at|tachment to its laws and cu&s;toms, are obliterated from our minds; and nothing can re&s;ult from this opinion, when grown into a principle, and
<PB N="136" REF="137">
animated by di&s;content, ambition, or enthu&s;ia&s;m, but a &s;eries of con&s;piracies and &s;editions, &s;ome|times ruinous to their authors, always noxious to the &s;tate. No &s;en&s;e of duty can prevent any man from being a leader or a follower in &s;uch en|terprizes. Nothing re&s;trains the tempter; nothing guards the tempted. Nor is the new &s;tate, fabri|cated by &s;uch arts, &s;afer than the old. What can prevent the mere will of any per&s;on, who hopes to unite the wills of others to his own, from an attempt wholly to overturn it? It wants nothing but a di&s;|po&s;ition to trouble the e&s;tabli&s;hed order, to give a title to the enterprize.</P>
<P>When you combine this principle of the right to change a fixed and tolerable con&s;titution of things at plea&s;ure, with the theory and practice of the French a&s;&s;embly, the political, civil, and moral ir|regularity are if po&s;&s;ible aggravated. The a&s;&s;embly have found another road, and a far more commo|dious, to the de&s;truction of an old government, and the legitimate formation of a new one, than through the previous will of the majority of what they call the people. Get, &s;ay they, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of power by any means you can into your hands; and then a &s;ub&s;equent con&s;ent (what they call an <HI>addre&s;s of ad|he&s;ion)</HI> makes your authority as much the act of the people as if they had conferred upon you origi|nally that kind and degree of power, which, without their permi&s;&s;ion, you had &s;eized upon. This is to give a direct &s;anction to fraud, hypo|cri&s;y, perjury, and the breach of the mo&s;t &s;acred tru&s;ts that can exi&s;t between man and man. What can &s;ound with &s;uch horrid di&s;cordance in the mo|ral ear, as this po&s;ition, That a delegate with limited powers may break his &s;worn engagements to his con&s;tituent, a&s;&s;ume an authority, never committed to him, to alter all things at his plea&s;ure; and then, if he can per&s;uade a large number of men to flatter him
<PB N="137" REF="138">
in the power he has u&s;urped, that he is ab&s;olved in his own con&s;cience, and ought to &s;tand acquitted in the eyes of mankind? On this &s;cheme the maker of the experiment mu&s;t begin with a determined per|jury. That point is certain. He mu&s;t take his chance for the expiatory addre&s;&s;es. This is to make the &s;ucce&s;s of villainy the &s;tandard of innocence.</P>
<P>Without drawing on, therefore, very &s;hocking con&s;equences, neither by previous con&s;ent, nor by &s;ub&s;equent ratification of a <HI>mere reckoned majority,</HI> can any &s;et of men attempt to di&s;&s;olve the &s;tate at their plea&s;ure. To apply this to our pre&s;ent &s;ub|ject. When the &s;everal orders, in their &s;everal bailliages, had met in the year 1789, &s;uch of them, I mean, as had met peaceably and con&s;titutionally, to choo&s;e and to in&s;truct their repre&s;entatives, &s;o organized, and &s;o acting, (becau&s;e they were or|ganized and were acting according to the conventions which made them a people) they were the <HI>people</HI> of France. They had a legal and a natural capacity to be con&s;idered as that people. But ob&s;erve, that whil&s;t they were in that &s;tate, that is, whil&s;t they were a people, in no one of their in&s;tructions did they charge or even hint at any of tho&s;e things, which have drawn upon the u&s;urping a&s;&s;embly, and their ad|herents, the dete&s;tation of the rational and thinking part of mankind. I will venture to affirm, without the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of being contradicted by any per&s;on who knows the then &s;tate of France, that if any one of the changes were propo&s;ed, which form the fundamental parts of their revolution, and com|po&s;e its mo&s;t di&s;tingui&s;hing acts, it would not have had one vote in twenty thou&s;and in any order. Their in&s;tructions purpo&s;ed the direct contrary to all tho&s;e famous proceedings, which are defended as the acts of the people. Had &s;uch proceedings been expected, the great probability is, that the peo|ple would then have ri&s;en, as to a man, to prevent
<PB N="138" REF="139">
them. The whole organization of the a&s;&s;embly was altered, the whole frame of the kingdom was changed, before the&s;e things could be done. It is long to tell, by what evil arts of the con&s;pirators, and by what extreme weakne&s;s and want of &s;teadine&s;s in the lawful government, this equal u&s;urpation on the rights of the prince and people, having fir&s;t cheated, and then offered violence to both, has been able to triumph, and to employ with &s;ucce&s;s the forged &s;ignature of an impri&s;oned &s;overeign, and the &s;pu|rious voice of dictated addre&s;&s;es, to a &s;ub&s;equent ratification of things that had never received any previous &s;anction, general or particular, expre&s;&s;ed or implied, from the nation (in whatever &s;en&s;e that word is taken) or from any part of it.</P>
<P>After the weighty and re&s;pectable part of the peo|ple had been murdered, or driven by the menaces of murder from their hou&s;es, or were di&s;per&s;ed in exile into every country in Europe; after the &s;oldiery had been debauched from their officers; after pro|perty had lo&s;t its weight and con&s;ideration, along with its &s;ecurity; after voluntary clubs and a&s;&s;ocia|tions of factious and unprincipled men were &s;ub&s;titu|ted in the place of all the legal corporations of the kingdom arbitrarily di&s;&s;olved; after freedom had been bani&s;hed from <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The primary a&s;&s;emblies.</NOTE> tho&s;e popular meetings, who&s;e &s;ole recommendation is freedom&mdash;After it had come to that pa&s;s, that no di&s;&s;ent dared to appear in any of them, but at the certain price of life; after even di&s;&s;ent had been anticipated, and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ina|tion was as quick as &s;u&s;picion; &s;uch pretended rati|fication by addre&s;&s;es could be no act of what any lover of the people would choo&s;e to call by their name. It is that voice which every &s;ucce&s;sful u&s;ur|pation, as well as this before us, may ea&s;ily pro|cure, even without making (as the&s;e tyrants have
<PB N="139" REF="140">
made) donatives from the &s;poil of one part of the citizens to corrupt the other.</P>
<P>To clo&s;e all&mdash;The pretended <HI>rights of man,</HI> which have made this havock, cannot be the rights of the people. For to be a people, and to have the&s;e rights, are things incompatible. The one &s;uppo&s;es the pre|&s;ence, the other the ab&s;ence of a &s;tate of civil &s;o|ciety. The reader has &s;een, that in this country at lea&s;t, our Whig ance&s;tors proceeded on no &s;uch principles. The Whigs of this day have before them, in this Appeal, their con&s;titutional ance&s;tors: They have the doctors of the modern &s;chool. They will choo&s;e for them&s;elves. The author of the Reflections has cho&s;en for him&s;elf. If a new or|der is coming on, and all the political opinions mu&s;t pa&s;s away as dreams, which our ance&s;tors have wor&s;hipped as revelations, I &s;ay for him, that he would rather be the la&s;t (as certainly he is the lea&s;t) of that race of men, than the fir&s;t and great|e&s;t of tho&s;e who have coined to them&s;elves Whig principles from a French die, unknown to the im|pre&s;s of our fathers in the con&s;titution.</P>
