<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lord,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Beg leave to pre&s;ent to
your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> this
Treati&s;e, which, while
in <HI>Manu&s;cript,</HI> you &s;o
kindly and warmly
de&s;ired to &s;ee in <HI>Print.</HI>
The chief De&s;ign of the&s;e Sheets is to
recommend to my Fellow Creatures
that plain <HI>Diet</HI> which is mo&s;t agreeable
to the Purity and Simplicity of uncor|rupted
<HI>Nature,</HI> and unconquer'd <HI>Rea&s;on.</HI>
Ill would it &s;uit, <HI>my Lord,</HI> with &s;uch
a De&s;ign to introduce it with a Dedi|cation
<PB REF="3">
cook'd up to the Height of a
<HI>French</HI> or <HI>Italian</HI> Ta&s;te. Addre&s;&s;es of
this Kind are generally a Sort of <HI>Ra|gous</HI>
and <HI>Olios,</HI> compounded of Ingre|dients
as pernicious to the Mind as &s;uch
unnatural Meats are to the Body. Ser|vile
Flattery, ful&s;ome Compliments,
and <HI>bomba&s;t Panegyrick</HI> make up the
<HI>nau&s;eous</HI> Compo&s;ition. But I know
that your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI>'s Ta&s;te is too deli|cate,
and your Judgment too cha&s;te to
be able to bear &s;uch <HI>Cookery.</HI> Your
taking the&s;e Sheets into your Patronage
will probably be a Po&s;t not to be main|tained
without &s;ome Difficulty. <HI>Pre|judice,
Intere&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Appetite</HI> are power|ful
Antagoni&s;ts, which nothing but
good Sen&s;e, &s;olid Virtue, and true
<HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> Courage are capable of op|po&s;ing.
Was not your <HI>Lord&s;hip</HI> emi|nently
endued with tho&s;e invaluable
Qualities, I &s;hould not have been &s;o
fond of thru&s;ting this, almo&s;t <HI>Orphan-Work</HI>
out into the World under your
&s;afe Conduct. But your Practice, <HI>my
Lord,</HI> has long engaged you on the
<PB REF="4">
Side of Temperance, Sobriety, and
Virtue, and I hope you will not think
it a di&s;agreeable Task to avow and
ju&s;tify tho&s;e Principles to the Publick,
by which you have hitherto been guided
&s;o much to your Advantage in private.
I dare a&s;&s;ert, <HI>my Lord,</HI> that in defend|ing
this Cau&s;e you will fight under the
Banner of Truth: and be the Oppo&s;ition
of Prejudice, Error, or Malice, ever &s;o
mighty, I know that Patience and Per|&s;everance
will be &s;ufficient to render the
Conque&s;t &s;ecure. The promoting, ac|cording
to my be&s;t Abilities, the Ea&s;e,
Health, and Welfare of Mankind in ge|neral,
and of my fellow-&s;uffering <HI>Vale|tudinarians</HI>
in particular, has been the
whole and &s;ole View with which I have
once more dared to appear in <HI>Print.</HI>
Your Love of the De&s;ign will, I hope,
make you blind to the Imperfections
and Weakne&s;s of the Execution. The
Protection of &s;uch a Work, <HI>my Lord,</HI>
is properly yours. Your <HI>Humanity</HI> and
<HI>Benevolence</HI> are always engaging you
in the Pur&s;uit of the &s;ame Ends, tho'
<PB REF="5">
by different means. If you &s;till think,
after a mature Revi&s;al of the&s;e Papers,
that the&s;e my poor Endeavours may be
u&s;eful to the <HI>Publick,</HI> I know you will
be their generous Advocate, merely
upon Principle, and even in Oppo&s;ition
to Party. The Continuance of your
Approbation will give me a mo&s;t &s;incere
Plea&s;ure, as your Conde&s;cen&s;ion in per|mitting
me to do my&s;elf this <HI>Honour,</HI>
will always be e&s;teemed one of the many
Obligations you have &s;o kindly conferred

<HEAD>PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Title <HI>I have cho&s;en for
this</HI> Treati&s;e, <HI>is a</HI> Re|proach
<HI>univer&s;ally thrown
on this</HI> I&s;land <HI>by Foreign|ers,
and all our Neighbours on the</HI> Con|tinent,
<HI>by whom</HI> nervous <HI>Di&s;tempers,</HI>
Spleen, Vapours, <HI>and</HI> Lowne&s;s of Spi|rits,
<HI>are in Deri&s;ion, called the ENG|LISH
MAL ADY. And I wi&s;h
there were not &s;o good Grounds for this
Reflection. The</HI> Moi&s;ture <HI>of our</HI> Air,
<HI>the Variablene&s;s of our</HI> Weather, (<HI>from
our Situation amid&s;t the</HI> Ocean) <HI>the</HI>
Rankne&s;s <HI>and</HI> Fertility <HI>of our Soil, the</HI>
Richne&s;s <HI>and</HI> Heavine&s;s <HI>of our Food,
<PB N="ii" REF="7">
the</HI> Wealth <HI>and</HI> Abundance <HI>of the In|habitants
(from their univer&s;al Trade)
the</HI> Inactivity <HI>and</HI> &s;edentary <HI>Occupations
of the better Sort (among whom this</HI>
Evil <HI>mo&s;tly rages) and the Humour of
living in great populous and con&s;e|quently
unhealthy Towns, have brought
forth a</HI> Cla&s;s <HI>and</HI> Set <HI>of Di&s;tempers,
with atrocious and frightful</HI> Symptoms,
<HI>&s;carce known to our Ance&s;tors, and never
ri&s;ing to &s;uch fatal</HI> Heights, <HI>nor afflicting
&s;uch</HI> Numbers <HI>in any other known Na|tion.
The&s;e</HI> nervous <HI>Di&s;orders being
computed to make almo&s;t one</HI> third <HI>of the
Complaints of the People of</HI> Condition
<HI>in</HI> England.</P>
<P>II. THIS Work <HI>has lain fini&s;h'd by
me, as it now appears (at lea&s;t in the
main) the&s;e &s;everal Years pa&s;t, and
was intended as a</HI> Legacy <HI>and</HI> Dying-Speech,
<HI>only to my</HI> Fellow-Sufferers
<HI>under the&s;e Complaints. And had
certainly never appear'd (till its Au|thor
had di&s;appear'd) had it not been
for the perhaps indi&s;creet</HI> Zeal <HI>of
<PB N="iii" REF="8">
&s;ome of my warme&s;t Friends, who
(upon the late Frequency and daily
Encrea&s;e of wanton and uncommon
Self-murderers, produc'd mo&s;tly by this</HI>
Di&s;temper, <HI>and their</HI> bla&s;phemous <HI>and</HI>
frantick Apologies <HI>grafted on the Prin|ciples
of the</HI> Infidels, <HI>and propagated by
their</HI> Di&s;ciples) <HI>extorted it from me,
to try what a little more ju&s;t and &s;olid</HI>
Philo&s;ophy, <HI>join'd to a Method of</HI> Cure,
<HI>and proper Medicines could do, to put
a Stop to &s;o univer&s;al a</HI> Lunacy <HI>and</HI>
Madne&s;s.</P>
<P>III. SOME <HI>good natur'd and inge|nious
Retainers to the</HI> Profe&s;&s;ion, <HI>on
my Publication of my</HI> Book <HI>of</HI> long Life
and Health, <HI>proclaim'd every where
that I was turn'd mere</HI> Enthu&s;ia&s;t, <HI>and
re&s;olv'd all Things into</HI> Allegory <HI>and</HI>
Analogy, <HI>advis'd People to turn</HI>
Monks, <HI>to run into De&s;arts, and to
live on</HI> Roots, Herbs <HI>and</HI> wild Fruits;
<HI>in fine, that I was at Bottom a mere</HI>
Leveller, <HI>and for de&s;troying</HI> Order,
Ranks <HI>and</HI> Property, <HI>every one's but
<PB N="iv" REF="9">
my own. But that Sneer had its
Day, and vani&s;h'd into Smoak. Others
&s;wore I had eaten my</HI> Book, <HI>recanted
my</HI> Doctrine <HI>and</HI> Sy&s;tem <HI>(as they were
plea&s;ed to term it) and was returned
again to the</HI> Devil, <HI>the</HI> World <HI>and the</HI>
Fle&s;h <HI>This Joke I have al&s;o &s;tood.
I have been &s;lain again and again, both
in</HI> Ver&s;e <HI>and</HI> Pro&s;e; <HI>but I thank GOD
I am &s;till alive and well.</HI></P>
<P>IV. BUT <HI>to cut off all Occa&s;ions of
Mi&s;take, and every Handle of Mi&s;re|pre&s;entation
of my Meaning and Inten|tion,
as far as in me lies, I here
&s;olemnly declare it, as my</HI> Judgment
<HI>and</HI> Opinion (<HI>if it be worth the know|ing)
founded on the Experience and
Ob&s;ervation of many Years:</HI> 1&s;t, <HI>That
the</HI> Diet <HI>and</HI> Manner of Living <HI>of the
middling Rank, who are but moderate
and temperate in Foods of the common
and natural Product of the Country,</HI>
to wit <HI>in</HI> animal Foods <HI>plainly dre&s;s'd,
and Liquors purify'd by</HI> Fermentation
<HI>only, without the</HI> Tortures of the Fire,
<PB N="v" REF="10">
or without being turned into Spirits, <HI>is
that intended by the Author of Nature
for this</HI> Climate <HI>and</HI> Country, <HI>and
con&s;equently the mo&s;t whole&s;ome and
fitte&s;t in general, for</HI> prolonging Life,
<HI>and</HI> preventing Di&s;tempers, <HI>that the</HI>
Ends of Providence <HI>and the</HI> Conditions
<HI>of</HI> Mortality <HI>will admit.</HI> 2dly, <HI>That
no</HI> wi&s;e Man, <HI>who is but moderate and
temperate in this manner, ought</HI> on any
Account <HI>to alter the Kind and Quality
of his</HI> Diet <HI>while his</HI> Health <HI>and</HI> Ap|petite
<HI>are good.</HI> 3dly, <HI>That</HI> no wi&s;e
Man, <HI>even when he has fallen into, or
is threatened with a</HI> Di&s;temper, <HI>ought
to change the</HI> Quality <HI>of his</HI> Diet, <HI>till
he has duly and &s;ufficiently try'd, what</HI>
proper Medicines <HI>can do, by the Advice
of the mo&s;t experienced and knowing</HI>
Phy&s;icians. 4. <HI>That the Changes that
are advis'd to be made, ought to be
duly and maturely con&s;ider'd, and enter'd
upon by</HI> Degrees, <HI>whether from a</HI> higher
<HI>to a</HI> lower, <HI>or from a</HI> lower <HI>to a</HI> higher
Diet. 5. <HI>That &s;trong high</HI> animal
Foods <HI>and</HI> generous defecated &s;pirituous
<PB N="vi" REF="11">
Liquors, <HI>as begetting warm, full, and
enliven'd Juices, urgeing on the Cir|culation
with Force, and the Secre|tions
with Vigour, in young, robu&s;t,
healthy Con&s;titutions, are fitte&s;t and
mo&s;t effectual for Mechanical and ani|mal
Strength, Force, Action and
Labour: And &s;o ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for
Handy-Crafts, great Fatigue, and mili|tary
Prowe&s;s. But the&s;e are not the
Matter in Que&s;tion here, which is
about preventing and cureing Di&s;tem|pers
already brought on, brightening
the Faculties, and fitting them for intel|lectual
and &s;edentary Purpo&s;es, and
lengthening the natural Life.</HI> 6. <HI>That
a</HI> proper <HI>and</HI> &s;pecifick Diet <HI>for each</HI>
Di&s;temper, <HI>is as nece&s;&s;ary to be known
and pre&s;crib'd by an hone&s;t and faithful</HI>
Phy&s;ician, <HI>as proper and &s;pecifick Me|dicines;
(for in the&s;e two</HI> only, <HI>the very</HI>
E&s;&s;ence <HI>of the Science con&s;i&s;ts, not &s;epa|rately
but conjointly); and 7. That only
in tho&s;e Di&s;tempers commonly reckon'd</HI>
incureable, <HI>the Reproach of</HI> Phy&s;ick <HI>and</HI>
Phy&s;icians, <HI>and which are in their own
<PB N="vii" REF="12">
Nature, either</HI> mortal <HI>or in&s;upportably
painful, &s;uch as tortureing,</HI> habitual
Gouts, <HI>confirm'd</HI> Cancers, <HI>ob&s;tinate Ve|nereal
Di&s;tempers, the</HI> Stone <HI>in the</HI>
Kidneys, <HI>or in the</HI> Bladder (<HI>when Li|thotomy
cannot be admini&s;trated); a</HI>
Pulmonick Phthi&s;is, <HI>a</HI> Nervous Atrophy,
<HI>the</HI> Epilep&s;y, <HI>and the other higher and
inconquerable hy&s;terick and hypochon|driack
Di&s;orders, a &s;ettled</HI> Hectick
<HI>(from Ulcers) an</HI> Elephantia&s;is <HI>and</HI> Le|pro&s;y,
<HI>a humorous</HI> A&s;thma, <HI>a chronical</HI>
Diabetes, <HI>an incurable</HI> Scrophula <HI>and
a deep</HI> Scurvy. <HI>I &s;ay, in the&s;e only,
and only in the&s;e when they are be|come
manife&s;t, have re&s;i&s;ted all other
common Methods, and the Patients
are rather growing wor&s;e than bet|ter
under them, is a</HI> total <HI>and</HI> &s;trict
Milk, Seed <HI>and</HI> Vegetable Diet, <HI>proper
or to be attempted; and that in other
more &s;imple and &s;light Ca&s;es, and even
in the fir&s;t Stages of the&s;e mentioned
Di&s;tempers, a common moderate and
temperate animal Diet, and well-cho&s;en
Medicines, will be &s;ufficient. Now if
<PB N="viii" REF="13">
after all this, any one is di&s;pos'd to
be merry with me, I ought not, I
&s;hall not grudge them their Diver|&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>V. <HI>I think truly, a thin, poor, cool,
low Diet as improper and unnatural to
a</HI> robu&s;t, active, &s;trong, healthy Man,
<HI>as a gro&s;s, full, high Diet, is for a poor,
thin, low, valetudinary Creature. For
the whole Art of Phy&s;ick, and the
Wi&s;dom of animal Life, con&s;i&s;ts in ad|ju&s;ting
Diet and Medicines to the
Habit and the Di&s;tempers. For the
Diet that wou'd make a Nightingale
healthy and gay, wou'd &s;tarve and kill
a Kite, and on the contrary: But it
is odds if a Free-drinking, or Free-think|ing
Phy&s;ician be not as improper to advi&s;e
a poor weak, low, dying Creature, as
a Free-drinking, Free-thinking Ca&s;ui&s;t is
to advi&s;e a &s;crupulous and tender Con|&s;cience.
Men of all Profe&s;&s;ions</HI> think; write
<HI>and</HI> advi&s;e Them&s;elves, <HI>and their own
Characters, and impre&s;s their own</HI> Sig|natures
<HI>on every thing they do, &s;ay,
<PB N="ix" REF="14">
and advi&s;e; which, I hope, may be an</HI>
Apology <HI>for Me, if in any thing I have
over-&s;hot the</HI> Golden Mean, <HI>which I
am pretty certain I have not, to tho&s;e,
who rea&s;on and think, and prefer Health,
Cheerfulne&s;s, and long Life, to a &s;hort
Life and a merry.</HI></P>
<P>VI. AFTER <HI>all, I would not have it
thought, that I am of Opinion that none
ever fail'd or died, who enter'd on a</HI>
Milk, Seed, <HI>and</HI> Vegetable Diet <HI>under
the&s;e mention'd</HI> Di&s;tempers. <HI>The noble</HI>
Organs <HI>may be &s;poilt or irretrievably
ob&s;tructed, which the wi&s;e&s;t Phy&s;ician
alive cannot ab&s;olutely foreknow; the
Time remaining and nece&s;&s;ary for a total
Cure of &s;uch tedious Di&s;ea&s;es, may not
be &s;ufficient in the common</HI> Duration of
Life. <HI>All I affirm therefore, is, that
&s;uch a Diet in the</HI> mention'd Di&s;tem|pers,
<HI>with the u&s;ual proper Medicines,
duly per&s;i&s;ted in, will do the Whole that</HI>
Art <HI>can po&s;&s;ibly do, or Mortality will
admit; and infinitely more than the
&s;ame Medicines under a</HI> full <HI>and free</HI>
<PB N="x" REF="15">
Diet of Animal Foods <HI>and</HI> Spirituous
Liquors; <HI>and at the very lea&s;t, will
make their Pains and Sufferings le&s;s
both in</HI> Life <HI>and</HI> Death.</P>
<P>VII. WHAT <HI>I pretend to have done
in &s;ome Degree in the following Trea|ti&s;e,
is, That I hope I have explain'd
the Nature and Cau&s;es of</HI> Nervous Di&s;|tempers
<HI>(which have hitherto been rec|kon'd</HI>
Witchcraft, Enchantment, Sor|cery
<HI>and</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>and have been the
con&s;tant Re&s;ource of Ignorance) from
Principles ea&s;y, natural and intelligible,
deduc'd from the be&s;t and &s;ounde&s;t</HI> Na|tural
Philo&s;ophy; <HI>and have by the
plaine&s;t Rea&s;oning, drawn from the&s;e</HI>
Cau&s;es <HI>and this</HI> Philo&s;ophy, <HI>a</HI> Method
of Cure <HI>and a</HI> Cour&s;e of Medicines
<HI>&s;pecifically obviating the&s;e Cau&s;es, con|firm'd
by long Experience and repeated
Ob&s;ervations, and conformable to the
Practice of the able&s;t and be&s;t Writers
on the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xi" REF="16">
VIII. THE <HI>mo&s;t material Objection
my</HI> able&s;t Friends <HI>have made to this</HI> Piece
<HI>is, That much of it is a Repetition of
what I have already &s;aid in Print, and
&s;ome of it but a</HI> lame and imperfect
Repre&s;entation <HI>of what is much better
&s;aid by others. But as this</HI> Objection
<HI>regards only my&s;elf and my Reputation
as an</HI> Author, <HI>I will &s;uffer it to have
its whole Effect. There can be no
greater Evidence of the</HI> Truth <HI>of</HI> Prin|ciples,
<HI>than their being</HI> &s;imple <HI>and</HI> few,
<HI>and readily applicable to &s;olve all the
po&s;&s;ible Appearances. Nature produces
many and various Effects in different
Circum&s;tances, from one and the &s;ame
Cau&s;e.</HI> Truth <HI>is &s;imple and one in its
Root and Source, but various and mani|fold
in different Situations and Circum|&s;tances.
And I &s;hall not think it</HI> Tau|tology,
<HI>to pre&s;s and inculcate the &s;ame</HI>
Methods of Cure, <HI>even in different
Di&s;tempers, from the &s;ame Cau&s;es, if it
be done from different Views and Con&s;i|derations.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="17">
IX. THERE <HI>are two Sorts of Rea|ders
I have not the mo&s;t remote Hopes
of convincing or giving Satisfaction to;</HI>
viz. <HI>the</HI> Voluptuous <HI>and</HI> Unthinking.
<HI>Tho&s;e who value Life only for the Sake
of</HI> good Eating and Drinking, <HI>and tho&s;e
who&s;e</HI> thinking <HI>Faculties and</HI> Organs
<HI>have never been truly</HI> form'd <HI>or duly</HI>
cultivated; <HI>neither of</HI> the&s;e <HI>will ever
bear or can receive any Conviction or
Rea&s;oning from &s;uch</HI> Principles <HI>as I lay
down. But the</HI> Laws of Nature, <HI>and
the immutable</HI> Relations of Things, <HI>are
too &s;tubborn to bend to &s;uch</HI> Gentlemen;
<HI>and I &s;hould not chu&s;e to &s;tudy &s;uch a
Sort of</HI> Particulars, <HI>to learn incorrupted
Nature, its</HI> Laws <HI>and</HI> Order, <HI>no more
than I &s;hould apply to a</HI> mon&s;trous
Production <HI>to learn the</HI> Genius <HI>of a</HI>
Tribe, <HI>or a</HI> Species <HI>either of</HI> Vegetables
<HI>or</HI> Animals. <HI>Po&s;&s;ibly even they them|&s;elves
may be convinc'd, at lea&s;t in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, when their</HI> proper Time <HI>is
come; and &s;ooner or later it may come,
unle&s;s the</HI> Minute Philo&s;ophy <HI>prevail,
<PB N="xiii" REF="18">
and become the</HI> Standard. <HI>For probably
when they begin to feel violent</HI> Pain,
<HI>long</HI> Sickne&s;s, <HI>habitual</HI> Low Spirits, <HI>or
enter upon the</HI> Limits of both Worlds,
<HI>they may be convinced. For, in the
main, I believe the Cau&s;e of the&s;e Di&s;|tempers
here a&s;&s;ign'd,</HI> ju&s;t <HI>and</HI> adequate,
<HI>and on the Succe&s;s of the</HI> Methods of
Cure <HI>laid down in general (in Ca&s;es
where any thing would &s;ucceed) I could
venture my</HI> Reputation, Fortune <HI>and</HI>
Life.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Spirit of a Man can bear his
Infirmities, but a wounded Spirit
who can bear? &s;aith a Prophet.
As this is a great Truth in the <HI>In|tellectual
World,</HI> &s;o it may allude
to the <HI>Human Machin,</HI> to in&s;inuate, that a
Per&s;on of &s;ound Health, of &s;trong Spirits,
and firm Fibres, may be able to combat,
&s;truggle with, and nobly to bear and even
brave the Misfortunes, Pains, and Mi&s;eries
of this mortal Life, when the &s;ame Per&s;on,
broken, and di&s;pirited by Weakne&s;s of <HI>Nerves,
Vapours, Melancholy,</HI> or <HI>Age,</HI> &s;hall become
<PB N="2" REF="40">
dejected, oppre&s;s'd, peevi&s;h, and &s;unk even
below the Weakne&s;s of a Green&s;ickne&s;s Maid,
or a Child. Of this every one who has liv'd
any time in the World may have &s;een In&s;tances,
from the <HI>Hero</HI> to the City Girl. This I have
often ob&s;erv'd, and reflected on within my&s;elf,
with much Pity of the Folly and Mi&s;ery, the
Pride and Pre&s;umption of <HI>Human Nature,</HI>
which could value, or think to &s;upport it&s;elf,
upon its own natural Courage and Force. To
expect <HI>Fortitude, Patience, Tranquillity,</HI> and
<HI>Re&s;ignation,</HI> from the mo&s;t <HI>Heroick</HI> of the
Children of Men, under &s;uch Circum&s;tances,
from their natural Force or Faculties alone,
is equally ab&s;urd as to expect to fly without
Wings, or walk without Legs; the Strength
of the <HI>Nerves, Fibres,</HI> or <HI>Animal Spirits</HI> (as
they are call'd) being the nece&s;&s;ary In&s;truments
of the former, as the&s;e Members are of the
latter, Different natural Complexions of the
<HI>Soul</HI> and <HI>Intellectual</HI> Faculties, and different
Improvements from Education, <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> or
<HI>Religion,</HI> may make &s;ome &s;mall Odds in the
Behaviour of different Per&s;ons under the&s;e
Di&s;orders. But this depends much upon the
Degrees of the Di&s;temper, and the original
Frame and Make of the Body, even more
than can be readily imagin'd, as I have often
had undeniable Evidences to conclude. And,
of all the Mi&s;eries that afflict Human Life,
and relate principally to the Body, in this
Valley of Tears, I think, <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders,
<PB N="3" REF="41">
in their extream and la&s;t Degrees; are the
mo&s;t deplorable, and, beyond all compari&s;on;
the wor&s;t. It was the Ob&s;ervation of a learned
and judicious <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> that he had &s;een Per|&s;ons
labouring under the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Pains
of <HI>Gout, Stone, Cholick, Cancer,</HI> and all the
other Di&s;tempers that can tear the human
Machin, yet had he ob&s;erv'd them all willing
to prolong their wretched Being, and &s;carce
any ready to lay down chearfully the <HI>Load</HI> of
<HI>Clay,</HI> (we will except tho&s;e who were &s;uperna|turally
&s;upported) but &s;uch as labour'd under
a con&s;tant, internal Anxiety, meaning tho&s;e
mo&s;t &s;inking, &s;uffocating, and &s;trangling <HI>Ner|vous</HI>
Di&s;orders; it is truly the only Mi&s;ery
almo&s;t, to be dreaded and avoided in Life, if,
by any means, it can po&s;&s;ibly. Tho' other Evils
be Burdens, yet an erected Spirit may bear
them, but when the Supports are fallen, and
cover the Man with their Ruins, the De&s;ola|tion
is perfect. I greatly &s;u&s;pect, (and have
actually &s;een it in &s;ome) that mo&s;t of tho&s;e
who make away with them&s;elves, are under
the Influence of this di&s;tracting <HI>Evil,</HI> if it pro|ceeds
not &s;ometimes from high Pa&s;&s;ions ari&s;ing
in Con&s;titutions naturally too &s;en&s;ible, and
&s;uch are the mo&s;t readily expos'd to the In&s;ults
of the&s;e Di&s;tempers. Having &s;uffer'd once
and again under all the Varieties of the Symp|toms
of this Di&s;order, partly from my own
Indi&s;cretion, and partly from a gro&s;s Habit of
Body, and an original State of weak Nerves,
<PB N="4" REF="42">
and having tried in my own Per&s;on almo&s;t all
the po&s;&s;ible Means, Reliefs, or Medicines, that
<HI>Phy&s;icians, Books of Phy&s;ick,</HI> or <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI>
could &s;ugge&s;t, be&s;ides my own Ob&s;ervations
on many others, who have come to <HI>this Place</HI>
for Relief for the&s;e Thirty Years, and being
once and again perfectly re&s;cu'd from them by
the &s;ame Means, it will be a great Satisfaction
to me, if I can at lea&s;t alleviate and mitigate
the Sorrows and Mi&s;eries of my <HI>Fellow-Suffer|ers,</HI>
by the Experience I have &s;o dearly bought.</P>
<P>THOSE who are de&s;irous to read the en&s;u|ing
Treati&s;e only for their Relief and Cure,
may pa&s;s over tho&s;e Parts (which may be learned
by the Index) that are merely <HI>Philo&s;ophical,</HI> and
de&s;ign'd only to gratify their Curio&s;ity, they
having no nece&s;&s;ary Connection with what is
<HI>Directory</HI> or <HI>Practical.</HI></P>
<P>THESE need only &s;uppo&s;e, that the Human
Body is a Machin of an infinite Number and
Variety of different Channels and Pipes, filled
with various and different Liquors and Fluids,
perpetually running, glideing, or creeping for|ward,
or returning backward, in a con&s;tant
<HI>Circle,</HI> and &s;ending out little Branches and Out|lets,
to moi&s;ten, nouri&s;h, and repair the Ex|pences
of Living. That the Intelligent Prin|ciple,
or <HI>Soul,</HI> re&s;ides &s;omewhere in the Brain,
where all the Nerves, or In&s;truments of Sen&s;a|tion
terminate, like a <HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> in a finely
<PB N="5" REF="43">
fram'd and well-tun'd Organ-Ca&s;e; that the&s;e
Nerves are like <HI>Keys,</HI> which, being &s;truck on
or touch'd, convey the Sound and Harmony
to this &s;entient Principle, or <HI>Mu&s;ician.</HI></P>
<P>OR, in a more gro&s;s Similitude, the Intelli|gen
Principle is like a Bell in a Steeple, to which
there are an infinite Number of Hammers all
around it, with Ropes of all Lengths, termina|ting
or touching at every Point of the Surface of
the Trunk or Ca&s;e, one of who&s;e Extremities
being pull'd or touch'd by any <HI>Body</HI> what&s;oever,
conveys a mea&s;ur'd, and proportion'd Impul&s;e
or Stroke to the Bell, which gives the proper
Sound. The&s;e, or &s;uch like Similitudes, tho'
Lame and Imperfect, are all, I doubt, was
ever de&s;ign'd for the Generality of Mankind
in the Knowledge nece&s;&s;ary towards HEALTH
and LIFE, in &s;uch Matters. Tho&s;e acquainted
with the be&s;t <HI>Philo&s;ophy, Natural Hi&s;tory,</HI> The
<HI>Laws</HI> con&s;tantly ob&s;erv'd by <HI>Bodies</HI> in their
Actions on one another, and the e&s;tabli&s;h'd
Relations of Things, will, I hope, meet with
fuller Satisfaction, if they con&s;ider the follow|ing

<P>&sect; I. THE mo&s;t univer&s;al and com|prehen&s;ive
Sources and Cau&s;es
of Chronical Di&s;tempers are,
1<HI>&s;t.</HI> A <HI>Glewine&s;s, Sizyne&s;s,
Vi&s;cidity,</HI> or <HI>Gro&s;sne&s;s</HI> in the Fluids, either
accidental, or acquir'd by tho&s;e Per&s;ons who
were born with &s;ound or good condition'd
Juices; or original and hereditary, in tho&s;e
who have brought them &s;o di&s;pos'd into the
World with them, from the ill State of Health
and bad State of Humours of the Parents,
which, po&s;&s;ibly, <HI>they</HI> may have had tran&s;mitted
to them from theirs, and &s;o on for many Ge|nerations
backwards. A rotten and corrupt
Tree can produce nothing but bad Fruit, nor
can any natural Cau&s;e have a better Effect than
its Principles, or Natural Qualities can pro|duce.
<PB N="7" REF="45">
2<HI>dly,</HI> Some Sharpne&s;s or corro&s;ive Qua|lity
in the Fluids, ari&s;ing from a <HI>&s;aline</HI> or
other de&s;tructive Mixture thrown into them,
or from &s;ome gro&s;s Concretions not &s;ufficient|ly
broken and divided by the dige&s;tive Powers
in the <HI>Alimentary</HI> Tube, retarding or &s;top|ping
the Circulation in the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els,
whereby the &s;tagnant Juices become &s;harp
and corro&s;ive, and the Salts have Time, by
their innate attractive Quality, to cry&s;talize
or unite in greater Clu&s;ters, and exert their
de&s;tructive Force on the Solids; and this will
be &s;till more pernicious and fatal, if the Food
is not only in too great a Quantity for the
concoctive Powers to break and divide it &s;uf|ficiently,
but is likewi&s;e too high, &s;trong,
and full of Salts, from which the mo&s;t ter|rible
Symptoms will en&s;ue. 3<HI>dly,</HI> A too great
Laxity or Want of due Tone, Ela&s;ticity and
Force in the <HI>Fibres</HI> in general, or the <HI>Nerves</HI> in
particular. There is a due Degree of Strength,
Power and Springyne&s;s required in the Fibres
or Solids, not only to make the Juices circu|late,
and carry on their Motions backwards
and forwards in a continual <HI>Rotation</HI> thro'
the whole Habit, but al&s;o to break, divide,
and &s;ubtilize them further, that they may be
able ea&s;ily to pa&s;s, not only thro' the &s;lender
and finer Tubes of the capillary Ve&s;&s;els, but
al&s;o through the Strainers of the <HI>Glands,</HI> either
to throw off tho&s;e Recrements and gro&s;&s;er
<PB N="8" REF="46">
Parts, which are not required for the ani|mal
Functions, or to &s;eparate tho&s;e Juices
which are required for the Pre&s;ervation of
the Individual. The&s;e are the mo&s;t effectual,
general and immediate Cau&s;es of all chronical
Di&s;tempers, of which, when any one is, in
any eminent Degree, become habitual, the
other two &s;pring up, or follow very &s;oon, and
join with it in producing the various Symp|toms
of the&s;e Di&s;orders. Other Specialities
and Circum&s;tances may concur with them,
but they would have little Effect, if the&s;e
could be &s;uppo&s;ed ab&s;ent or removed.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. THE <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Cau&s;e mentioned will ob|&s;truct
and po&s;&s;ibly bur&s;t the &s;mall and capil|lary
Ve&s;&s;els that carry about the Fluids, pro|ducing
<HI>Tumours, Swellings,</HI> and <HI>Ulcers,</HI> and
will not only tumify and afterwards relax and
&s;poil the whole almo&s;t infinite Set of <HI>Glands,</HI>
external and internal, but e&s;pecially tho&s;e
which are properly called <HI>Emunctory</HI> ones,
and &s;o &s;top the Secretions, and fill the Body
with vicious and morbid Juices. This Di&s;|tention,
Swelling and Hardne&s;s of the <HI>Glands</HI>
and &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, will likewi&s;e pre&s;s upon the
Nerves, &s;top and intercept their <HI>Vibrations</HI> or
<HI>Tremors,</HI> or whatever el&s;e be their Action, and
con&s;equently &s;poil their natural Functions.
The <HI>&s;econd</HI> will not only rend, tear and &s;poil
the Ve&s;&s;els, creating acute Pains, and produce|ing
<PB N="9" REF="47">
corrofive, <HI>Scorbutick</HI> and <HI>Cancerous</HI> Ulcers
and Sores, in all Parts of the Body, but will
al&s;o, by twitching and vellicating the <HI>Nerves</HI>
or nervous Fibres, produce Convul&s;ions, Spa&s;ms,
and all the terrible Symptoms of that Tribe
of nervous Di&s;tempers. The <HI>la&s;t</HI> mentioned
Cau&s;e will not only weaken and de&s;troy volun|tary
Motion, and the Force and Freedom of
the <HI>intellectual</HI> Operations (for the Exerci&s;e of
which, as long as the Union la&s;ts, material Or|gans
and their Soundne&s;s and Integrity &s;eems to
be required as well as for the animal Functions)
but will al&s;o retard and weaken the Circu|lation,
&s;top the Per&s;piration, and confound and
di&s;order the Secretions, and all the Functions
that belong to either Part of the Com|pound.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the General Cau&s;es of the Di&s;|orders
of the Nerves.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; 1. THE Solids, and con&s;equently
the Fibres and <HI>Nerves</HI> whereof,
they are woven and compli|cated,
are &s;ubject to &s;everal
Di&s;orders which may interrupt and entirely
ruin their Functions. As, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> by become|ing
either too dry, or too moi&s;t, that is by
Want, or Exce&s;s of Humidity, Moi&s;ture or
Nouri&s;hment to keep their Parts in a due or
proper <HI>Tone</HI> or <HI>Ela&s;ticity.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> general|ly
ari&s;es from a too hot, dry, and as it were
corro&s;ive Nouri&s;hment, which renders them
too cri&s;p, over <HI>ela&s;tick,</HI> and brittle, and &s;o
forces on the Circulation, and &s;ends about
the Juices with too great Force, Rapidity,
and Violence, in&s;tead of that calm and uni|form
manner, in which the Functions, and
Secretions of the animal <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> are natu|rally
perform'd, and that due Balance, which
ought, naturally to be between the Solids and
<PB N="11" REF="49">
Fluids. And this probably has a great Share
in the Production of inflammatory Di&s;orders,
high Fevers, and the other acute Di&s;tempers
of &s;trong Con&s;titutions. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> from too
great a Quantity of oily and nutritious Juices
thrown on them more than the Expences of
living require, &s;oaking and relaxing the So|lids,
renders their Action languid, and has a
greater Share in the Productions of &s;low and
cold Di&s;ea&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. <HI>Secondly,</HI> BY improper, hard, &s;olid and
noxious Particles getting into their Sub&s;tan|ces,
which may gradually alter, &s;poil and &s;top
their natural Texture and Functions what|ever
that happen to be, whether <HI>Vibration,
Inte&s;tine Action,</HI> and <HI>Reaction</HI> or <HI>Colli&s;ion</HI> of
their &s;mall Parts, or however they act or
are acted upon, to convey and propagate the
Sen&s;ations or Influences of external Bodies, to
the Seat of the <HI>intelligent Principle:</HI> For
when the Juices are &s;poil'd, and the Blood de|clines
from its due Fluidity and <HI>Balmyne&s;s,</HI>
the nutritive Juices mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily partake
of their general Nature, and become crowd|ed
and filled with hard, large Concretions,
of a different Nature from the genuine and
natural Condition of the Blood and Juices, in
their healthy State, which whence&s;oever they
may ari&s;e, or whatever different Qualities
they may be endued with; I choo&s;e to call
by the general Name of <HI>Animal Salts.</HI> The
<PB N="12" REF="50">
<HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Fibres</HI> being thus unnaturally
nouri&s;hed and repair'd, mu&s;t, in &s;uch a State,
either entirely &s;top and bring no Sen&s;ation at
all to the intelligent Principle, and convey no
Action from it to the Mu&s;cles and Organs of
Animal Motion, or at lea&s;t fal&s;e, imperfect and
delu&s;ory ones; for the&s;e Salts, and &s;uch like
hard, &s;olid, compact and angular Particles, will
be more readily in&s;inuated into the tender
Threads of the Solids, having a greater De|gree
of <HI>Attraction</HI> in proportion to their
Bulks, than the more rare, &s;oft, and &s;pongy
ones.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> FROM the Interruption, In|terception
and Stoppage of their <HI>Vibrations,
Tremors,</HI> and the inte&s;tine Action of their
component Particles, by the greater Pre&s;&s;ure
of too vi&s;cid Juices in the Blood Ve&s;&s;els, and
the other Tubes that contain the animal Juices,
&s;urrounding the&s;e Fibres or <HI>Nerves:</HI> For it's
well known, that a more glutinous and vi&s;cid
Fluid, circulating in an ela&s;tick or di&s;tractile
Canal, will bulge it up, and pre&s;s upon its
Sides more &s;trongly than a thinner and more
rare Fluid one, and &s;o the Sides of the Canal
will become more &s;trait and tumified, pre&s;|&s;ing
thereby on the <HI>Nerves,</HI> as if it were
a <HI>Wedge</HI> or &s;olid Body, and interrupting
their natural Actions. The &s;ame is to be
concluded from the Tumefaction, Indura|ration,
and Swelling of the <HI>Glands,</HI> which
<PB N="13" REF="51">
being extremely numerous over all the Body,
mu&s;t greatly endamage the <HI>Nervous Sy&s;tem.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. IV. <HI>Fourthly,</HI> FROM the natural or ac|quired
Weakne&s;s and Laxity of their <HI>Tone</HI>
and <HI>Ela&s;ticity,</HI> whether from a natural or ac|cidental
ill Structure or Formation of them|&s;elves
or the other Organs of the Body, or
from any external Injury received on them:
And &s;uch is the Ca&s;e of tho&s;e who are born
of weakly or old Parents, or who&s;e Parents
have long labour'd under the <HI>Gout, Scurvy,
Elephantia&s;is, Lepro&s;y, Venereal</HI> or <HI>Nervous</HI>
Di&s;orders; tho&s;e who have had a Cont$&s;ion
on the Head, Back-bone, or any other Part
of the Body, where there are the greate&s;t
Collection of <HI>Nerves;</HI> and <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> tho&s;e who
have a Hump, or any preternatural Di&s;tor|tion
or Excre&s;cence, e&s;pecially on the Trunk
of the Body.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. AND tho' all the&s;e general Cau&s;es,
mentioned in the former and this <HI>Chapter,</HI>
concur in all chronical and nervous Di&s;tempers
what&s;oever, in &s;ome Degree or other, and
perhaps &s;ome other more minute Circum|&s;tances,
which are not &s;o readily found out,
or much to be regarded, yet Di&s;ea&s;es differ
and have received their Names by <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI>
according as the Symptoms ari&s;ing from this
or that general Cau&s;e mentioned, are more
evident, numerous or &s;tronger. But the&s;e
<PB N="14" REF="52">
Di&s;ea&s;es are chiefly and properly called <HI>Ner|vous,</HI>
who&s;e Symptoms imply that the Sy&s;tem
of the <HI>Nerves</HI> and their Fibres, are evident|ly
relax'd and broken. The Brevity I intend
in this Treati&s;e, will not allow me to detail
all the Kinds of Nervous Di&s;tempers that
have been ob&s;erv'd and named; they are &s;uf|ficiently
known, or may be learned from
Books of <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> and I think may be re|duced
to the following general Heads.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3 N="3" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the General Divi&s;ion of Nervous
Di&s;tempers.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. I. ALL Nervous Di&s;tempers what|&s;oever
from Yawning and
Stretching, up to a mortal
Fit of an Apoplexy, &s;eems to me to be but
one continued Di&s;order, or the &s;everal
Steps or Degrees of it, ari&s;ing from a Re|laxation
or Weakne&s;s, and the Want of a
&s;ufficient Force and Ela&s;ticity in the Solids
in general, and the <HI>Nerves</HI> in particular, in
Proportion to the Re&s;i&s;tance of the Fluids, in
<PB N="15" REF="53">
order to carry on the Circulation, remove Ob|&s;tructions,
carry off the Recrements, and make
the Secretions. In treating of Nervous Di&s;|tempers,
the Di&s;orders of the <HI>Solids</HI> are chiefly
what are to be had regard to; yet they rare|ly
or never happen alone (except perhaps in
tho&s;e Nervous Di&s;orders that proceed from
acute Di&s;ea&s;es, preternatural Evacuations, ex|ternal
Injuries, or a wrong and unnatural
Make and Frame) but even in original ner|vous
Di&s;tempers there is always &s;ome Vi&s;ci|dity
or Sharpne&s;s attending them from the
bad Con&s;titutions of the Parents, from whom
they have derived their material Organs. This
is evident from the nervous Di&s;orders that at|tend
&s;crophulous and &s;corbutick Per&s;ons. And
from long and con&s;tant Ob&s;ervation, I am un|der
a Conviction, that no deep and eminent
Degree of nervous Di&s;orders happens to young
Per&s;ons, but from a manife&s;t or latent &s;cro|phulous
or &s;corbutick Taint, which implies
both Vi&s;cidity and Sharpne&s;s in the Juices: nor
any great Degree to adult Per&s;ons, originally
&s;ound, but from an acquired &s;corbutick Habit
or <HI>Cachexy.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. II. THE mo&s;t natural and general Di|vi&s;ion
of nervous Di&s;tempers will therefore be
thus. 1<HI>&s;t,</HI> Into tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es, that be&s;ides
their other Symptoms, are attended with a
partial or total Lo&s;s of Sen&s;ation for &s;ome
Time. This Branch will not only compre|hend
<PB N="16" REF="54">
all tho&s;e nervous Di&s;orders from Low|ne&s;s
of Spirits, lethargick Dullne&s;s, Melan|cholly
and Moping, up to a compleat <HI>Apo|plexy,</HI>
but al&s;o tho&s;e fainting Fits, &s;o com|mon
in Per&s;ons of weak Nerves. As a Con|&s;equence
from this Interruption of Sen&s;ation,
partial or total, there will nece&s;&s;arily follow a
Su&s;pen&s;ion of voluntary Motion. The intel|ligent
Principle, under this Inability of the
<HI>Nervous Sy&s;tem</HI> being bereaved of proper Or|gans
to convey its Orders to the Mu&s;cles, tho'
the&s;e la&s;t &s;hould remain &s;ufficiently fitted for
their proper Offices. This Cla&s;s of nervous
Di&s;orders &s;eems chiefly to ari&s;e from a <HI>Gro&s;s|ne&s;s,
Glewyne&s;s</HI> or <HI>Vi&s;cidity</HI> of the animal
Juices (&s;etting a&s;ide at pre&s;ent the Con&s;idera|tion
of their Sharpne&s;s and Acrimony, which
is never totally ab&s;ent, when the&s;e others are
in any eminent Degree, e&s;pecially in our
<HI>Northern</HI> Climates) which ob&s;tructs the <HI>Glands,</HI>
the &s;erous Pipes, and the capillary Blood|ve&s;&s;els,
and thereby breaks, interrupts and
weakens the Vibrations and Tremors, or what|ever
el&s;e is the Action of the nervous Fibres
properly &s;o called.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. <HI>Secondly,</HI> THOSE nervous Di&s;orders,
which are attended with a Lo&s;s of voluntary
Motion or Shakeing, in any particular Organ
or Limb, or in all the In&s;truments of volun|tary
Motion. Such are all tho&s;e of the para|lytick
Kind. From an univer&s;al <HI>Pal&s;y,</HI> a
<PB N="17" REF="55">
<HI>Hemiplegia</HI> (or Pal&s;y of half the Body) or
of a particular Limb, to a Deadne&s;s, Numb|ne&s;s,
Weakne&s;s, or Coldne&s;s upon any of
the Parts, external or internal. This Cla&s;s
of Di&s;ea&s;es &s;eems to ow its Origin to a
Weakne&s;s, Imbecility, and Lo&s;s of due <HI>Tone</HI>
in the Nervous Sy&s;tem, or an Interruption
of their Vibrations or proper Action, (what|ever
it be) whereby the Soul is di&s;abled to
communicat its <HI>Energy</HI> or Principle of Mo|tion
to the Mu&s;cular Fibres.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. THOSE Nervous Di&s;tempers that
are attended with <HI>Spa&s;ms,</HI> Cramps, Convul|&s;ions,
or violent Contractions of the Mu&s;cles.
Of this kind are all of the <HI>Convul&s;ive</HI> Tribe
from <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>Hy&s;terical</HI> Fits, or
the Convul&s;ions of the <HI>Epileptick</HI> Kind,
down to Yawning and Stretching. The&s;e
&s;eem to be produced by &s;ome hard-pointed
Concretions, &s;aline Particles, or &s;ome noxi|ous
Acid or acrimonious Steam, Wind, or ob|&s;tructed
Per&s;piration, lodged in the &s;mall
Ve&s;&s;els, or upon any Place where there are
the greate&s;t Collections of <HI>Nerves, viz.</HI> in
the Alimentary Tubes, the Cavities of the
Brain, the Trunk of the Body, or the Inter|&s;tices
of the Mu&s;cles, where twitching, &s;timu|lating,
and wounding the Nerves, or their
<HI>Membranes,</HI> it rai&s;es a general Di&s;order in the
whole nervous or &s;en&s;ible Fibres, whence the
&s;ame is derived upon the whole Mu&s;cular
<PB N="18" REF="56">
Sy&s;tem, and there provokes violent Throws,
Contractions, Cramps, and Spa&s;ms, until tor|menting
and wearying out the ela&s;tick Fibres,
at la&s;t, by their Strugglings and Efforts, the
de&s;tructive Matter is di&s;charged or removed:
Much in the manner of that Struggle which
we ob&s;erve from fulphureous, bituminous,
vitriolick, and ferrugineous Particles, uni|ting,
and fermenting in the Bowels of the
Earth, and thereby acquiring &s;uch Force,
Violence, and Impetuo&s;ity, as to make
Hou&s;es, Palaces, and Cities &s;hake and
tremble, overturn Hills and Mountains, and
make Rivers, Lakes, and the Sea it&s;elf, to
boil and heave (till they have forced a
Breach and Rupture for their Pa&s;&s;age into
the Air and Day,) &s;wallowing up all around,
and &s;preading De&s;olation and Ruin, as far as
their Influence can reach. But (to return
to my Subject) where the offending Matter
is &s;o pent up in &s;uch great Quantity, or &s;o
violent (as in the violent Hy&s;terick or Epilep|tick
Fits) as quite to overpower the weak
and feeble Solids, fainter Strugglings &s;uc|ceed,
and the Patient lies almo&s;t dead,
with few or languid Motions, and &s;ometimes
foaming at the Mouth: till the Di&s;ea&s;e is quite
&s;pent, or after a few repeated Struggles, the
Conte&s;t ends in Death.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. THERE is another common Divi&s;ion,
or rather Di&s;tinction of Nervous Di&s;orders,
<PB N="19" REF="57">
into <HI>original</HI> and <HI>acquir'd:</HI> But the&s;e differ|ing
only as old Age does from Manhood. I
&s;hall ju&s;t mention them. It is to be &s;up|po&s;ed
(at lea&s;t, at the mo&s;t remote Di&s;tance
of Time) that Mankind were originally
made &s;o, as not to differ (in any eminent
Degree, at lea&s;t, below that Standard re|quired
for good Health) in their Con&s;titutions.
Original Nervous Di&s;orders, therefore, mu&s;t
have had the &s;ame Source and Cau&s;e with
acquir'd ones. The Children, as to their
Bodies and bodily Di&s;ea&s;es being puni&s;hed
for the Faults, Follies, and Indi&s;cretions of
their Parents. The Streams or Outlets mu&s;t
partake of the &s;ame Qualities with the Spring
or Fountain Head. The wi&s;e Author of
Nature, in the pre&s;ent State of Things,
&s;eems to have e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws and Orders,
by which &s;econd Cau&s;es are to act upon, and
influence one another; which Laws, natu|ral
and material Bodies con&s;tantly ob&s;erve in
their Effects and Productions, and which <HI>He</HI>
never &s;eems to violate by any uncommon
or &s;upernatural Influence, except for intel|lectual
or moral Purpo&s;es; and therefore to
govern and direct the&s;e Laws, <HI>He</HI> has given to
his intelligent Creatures, Under&s;tanding and
free Will. So that a poor Creature, born &s;ubject
to Nervous Di&s;tempers, has no more Rea&s;on
to complain, than a Child, who&s;e Father has
&s;pent his worldly Fortune, and left him
poor, and de&s;titute.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="58">
&sect;. VI. IT is a Misfortune indeed, to be
born with weak Nerves, but if rightly us'd
and manag'd, even in the pre&s;ent State of
Things, (I meddle no further) it may be
the Occa&s;ion of greater Felicity: For, at
lea&s;t, it is (or ought to be) a Fence and
Security again&s;t the Snares and Temptations
to which the Robu&s;t and Healthy are ex|pos'd,
and into which they &s;eldom fail to
run; and thereby reduce them&s;elves to the
&s;ame, or, perhaps, a wor&s;e State than tho&s;e
who&s;e Misfortune happen'd to be, the being
born thus originally &s;ubject to Nervous Di&s;|orders.
Tho&s;e who have originally bad
Nerves, I &s;hall direct in the be&s;t Manner I
can afterwards.</P>
<P>&sect;. VII. I SHALL only here ob&s;erve two
things in regard to them. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, that
they are never to expect the &s;ame Force,
Strength, Vigour, and Activity, nor to be
made capable of running into the &s;ame In|di&s;cretions
or Exce&s;s of &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures
(without &s;uffering pre&s;ently, or on the Spot)
with tho&s;e of &s;trong Fibres and robu&s;t Con|&s;titutions.
No Art hitherto known, can make
an Eagle of a Wren, (for tho' a Wren, by Art
and Management, may be made, as it were, a
Nightingale, yet never a Carrion Crow or
Kite); but for all the innocent Enjoyments of
Life, (at lea&s;t, for Freedom from Pain and tor|turing
<PB N="21" REF="59">
Di&s;tempers, for Chearfulne&s;s and Free|dom
of Spirits, for intellectual Plea&s;ures,
mental Enjoyments, and Length of Days)
they (con&s;idering the Temptations and Mi|&s;eries
of this mortal State) generally have,
and may always have, the Advantage of
the&s;e others. (I always except extreme De|grees
of Nervous Di&s;ea&s;es.) As for intel|lectual
Plea&s;ures, the Ca&s;e is without all
manner of doubt, (without &s;ome notable
Error, or in extreme Ca&s;es) po&s;&s;ibly, be|cau&s;e
the Organs of the&s;e Operations being
in their own Nature delicate and fine, when
wa&s;ted or &s;crap'd, (by Chronical Di&s;ea&s;es
not mortal) and thus communicated to their
Po&s;terity, the&s;e naturally &s;ubtil Parts <HI>thus</HI>
become more fine and &s;en&s;ible, are hinder'd
by the natural Weakne&s;s of Children, in
their tender Years, to incra&s;&s;ate and grow
clum&s;y, and &s;o are longer pre&s;erv'd in
their Sen&s;ibility and Refinement; at lea&s;t
the Ca&s;e is generally in fact &s;o, (as I have
ob&s;erv'd in mo&s;t originally tender Per&s;ons,
well educated and di&s;ciplin'd) Infinite Good|ne&s;s
and Power bringing Good out of inno|cent
Evil. (For the common Proverb is ju&s;t
and true, that a <HI>Venice Gla&s;s</HI> will la&s;t as long,
if well look'd after, and even &s;hine more
bright, than a more gro&s;s and coar&s;e one.)
But to leave the&s;e Po&s;&s;ibilities, and pa&s;s
to,</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="60">
&sect;. VIII. THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> thing, which is, that
tho&s;e who have originally weak Solids, and
have carefully avoided the Exce&s;&s;es and Sen|&s;ual
Plea&s;ures which reduce the Robu&s;t to
that Ca&s;e, and have follow'd the Directions
that may be learn'd, for &s;trengthening their
Fibres and pre&s;erving them from being over|laid,
if they get over the Meridian of Life
(or their thirty-fifth or thirty-&s;ixth Year)
without any mortal Di&s;temper, have a fair
Chance to get into a firm State of Health,
Vigour, and Spirits afterwards, and to hold
it on without any Rub (if they be &s;o wi&s;e
then to keep from Exce&s;&s;es, or immoderate
Sen&s;ual Plea&s;ures) to a great and <HI>green old
Age,</HI> as I have con&s;tantly ob&s;erv'd. So true is
the common Ob&s;ervation, that every wi&s;e Man
has a <HI>Youthhood</HI> once in his Life, if not in his
early and tender Years, at lea&s;t, in his old Age:
And this &s;eems not only con&s;i&s;tent with the
Wi&s;dom of Providence, but the Nece&s;&s;ity of
Things, and the Order of Nature; for let us
&s;uppo&s;e that crazy putrified Parents &s;hould
bring into the World &s;uch a Child as I have
mentioned, the Parent's Juices, for want of
&s;ufficient Time, or proper Means, are not
rectified. The Child's, on the contrary,
from the Nece&s;&s;ity of its low Diet, and the
Length of its Nonage, (e&s;pecially if proper
Methods be us'd, and proper Medicines
join'd) mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become &s;weeter and
<PB N="23" REF="61">
purer: And if none of the great Organs be
&s;poil'd-&s;o, as gradually to infect the whole
(which generally begins to &s;hew it&s;elf, when
the Growth or Unfolding of the Solids comes
to its greate&s;t Heighth and Exten&s;ion, or
about the mention'd Period of the Meridian
of Life) the Juices then becoming &s;weet, will,
by Degrees, have their Effect upon the
Solids, &s;o that about the Time when others
decline, the&s;e, on the contrary, begin to re|vive
and &s;pring; and enjoy that <HI>Youth</HI> which
others have &s;urviv'd: And thus Age (which
naturally hardens and &s;tiffens the Fibres in
others) recompences the Caution, Care, and
Sufferings of their younger Days, by a
greater Degree of Strength, more Chearful|ne&s;s,
&s;tronger Spirits, and a greater Length
of Days than is common.</P>
<P>&sect;. IX. THOSE, who being born &s;ound
and healthy, of a &s;trong Con&s;titution, and a
firm State of Nerves, have acquir'd the con|trary
State, may have brought it on either,
<HI>fir&s;t,</HI> by <HI>Accidents,</HI> as I have before men|tion'd,
&s;uch as a Wound, Brui&s;e, Di&s;loca|tion;
or Fracture, which may introduce
Humps, Di&s;tortions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and alter the na|tural
good Configurations of the Parts, who&s;e
Cure mu&s;t depend upon the <HI>Surgeon</HI>'s Art,
by his endeavouring to reduce the&s;e to their
original State: to which likewi&s;e Remedies
may be &s;ugge&s;ted for the pre&s;ent Relief of
<PB N="24" REF="62">
the Nervous Di&s;tempers thence depending,
in the Directions afterwards to be given.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> By a bad, corrupt, or a too poor and
low Diet, indi&s;creet Exce&s;s of bodily Labour,
or having expos'd them&s;elves too much to
the Injuries of the Weather, whereby the
Juices have been defrauded of that due Pro|portion
of Heat, Nouri&s;hment, and Bal&s;am,
the Fibres become weak and relax'd, the
Mu&s;cles flabby and flaccid, and Lowne&s;s of
Spirits, Melancholy, and all the Degrees and
Complications .of Nervous Di&s;tempers have
en&s;ued. Such are tho&s;e of the poorer Sort,
who are deprived of the due Nece&s;&s;aries and
Conveniencies of Life, tho&s;e who have gone
long and dangerous Voyages, who live in
Pri&s;ons, or travel in De&s;arts, or tho&s;e who are
confin'd to Mona&s;teries and Hermitages. But
as this Country is pretty free from &s;uch
Ca&s;es, and the Remedy is obvious, I need
&s;ay no more of them, <HI>Thirdly,</HI> By Intem|perance,
want of due Exerci&s;e, rioting in
&s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures, ca&s;ual exce&s;&s;ive Evacua|tions
of any Kind, Fevers and other acute
Di&s;ea&s;es not duly manag'd, by which the
Juices have been made &s;izy or corro&s;ive,
and the due Tone, Spring and Ela&s;ticity of
the Nerves or Solids relax'd and broken,
whereby the true acquir'd Nervous Di&s;orders
are produc'd. To re&s;tore &s;uch to a &s;ound
State of Health, and a good Con&s;titution, or,
at lea&s;t, to relieve their Symptoms, as far
<PB N="25" REF="63">
as my poor Abilities can effect, &s;hall be
my &s;incere Endeavour in the following

that this terre&s;trial Globe, and
the State of Things in it, and
about it at pre&s;ent, is not de&s;ign'd merely

carrying about us corruptible Bodies, in
their own Nature peri&s;hable, &s;ubject to Ac|cidents,
Di&s;ea&s;es, and, at la&s;t, to Death it|&s;elf;

to. But as the Influence and Operation of
the&s;e Cau&s;es is &s;eldom &s;o long continued,
as that of the other Cau&s;es I have formerly
mention'd, &s;o tho&s;e who are mo&s;t &s;ubject
to the unhappy Con&s;equences of &s;uch Ex|ce&s;&s;es,
are generally well guarded and pro|tected
again&s;t any Hurt from the&s;e men|tioned
Accidents, which accordingly hap|pen
more frequently to tho&s;e of the lower
Rank. It is is true indeed, when the &s;ame
Exce&s;&s;es of tho&s;e of a high Condition,
are join'd to the other Perils and Hard|&s;hips
<PB N="32" REF="70">
of the lower Rank now mentioned, it
makes the Di&s;tre&s;s and Pain the greate&s;t of
all, and is the proper <HI>Scene</HI> where &s;uch <HI>Tra|gedies</HI>
are acted to the utmo&s;t Perfection of
Mi&s;ery and Woe. But as &s;uch extraordi|nary
Circum&s;tances rarely fall out, they are
not properly the &s;ubject Matter of what we
are chiefly concern'd about. To proceed
then, let us &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch a Per&s;on as I have
de&s;crib'd, rioting and wallowing in Luxury
for &s;ome con&s;iderable Time, his Fibres,
Nerves, and Motive Organs being yet firm
and unbroken. The mo&s;t natural Effect of
&s;uch a Cour&s;e, will be, to fill the Blood and
Juices with an Exce&s;s of &s;uch oily, &s;ulphu|reous,
and inflammatory Particles, as are
mo&s;t readily turn'd into red Globules, which
make the fibrous Part of the Blood. Such
an inflammatory Blood (the Solids being yet
ten&s;e and firm) will nece&s;&s;arily be driven about
with too great Force and Violence, and forced
into the &s;mall and capillary Ve&s;&s;els, de&s;ign'd
for the Lymph or thinner Fluids only, and
thus inflammatory and <HI>acute</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es are
produc'd, with all the Varieties and Degrees
of their Symptoms: &s;uch as <HI>Fevers</HI> of all
Sorts and Kinds, the <HI>Gout, Ery&s;ipelas, Rheu|mati&s;m,</HI>
and the like. If the&s;e &s;mall lym|phatick
Ve&s;&s;els, by the Force of the Circu|lation,
and the Gro&s;sne&s;s of the Fluid, driven
into them, are broken and torn, then fol|low

<PB N="33" REF="71">
and all their Train of Mi&s;eries, e&s;pecially,
if, together with the&s;e mention'd Conditions,
great Store of <HI>animal</HI> or <HI>urinous Salts</HI> are
brought together in great Quantities (which
never fails under &s;uch a Cour&s;e) and unite
and combine in larger Clu&s;ters and Concre|tions,
whereby the Solids are corroded, eaten
and de&s;troy'd, the natural Functions of the
Nerves &s;poil'd and perverted, and the ex|treme
Degrees of Torture, Malignity, and
Duration are added to the other Symptoms
of the&s;e inflammatory Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. THIS will nece&s;&s;arily be the Ca&s;e in
a young robu&s;t Body and Con&s;titution, when
&s;uch Exce&s;&s;es are violent, quick, and long
continued, and the Solids have not yet lo&s;t
their Tone and Vigour, whereby the Indi|vidual
will be quickly brought into tho&s;e
acute, inflammatory, and violent Di&s;tem|pers;
and then, by continu'd violent Con|flicts,
Nature, after many Struggles, will
either break, divide, and &s;ubtilize the&s;e
numerous, fiery, and inflammatory Globules,
and tho&s;e &s;harp-pointed, hard, and acrimo|nious
Salts, and drive them out of the Habit
by &s;uch <HI>Cri&s;es</HI> as I have de&s;crib'd; and the
Con&s;titution being purified, the Patient will
gradually return to his former Health and
Soundne&s;s: Or if this cannot be effected, by
rea&s;on of the Strength of the Di&s;ea&s;e, or the
Greatne&s;s of the Ob&s;truction in the &s;mall
<PB N="34" REF="72">
Ve&s;&s;els, the Per&s;on mu&s;t unavoidably &s;ub|mit
to Fate. But if &s;uch a Cour&s;e be pur|&s;ued
more &s;lowly, and by more moderate
Degrees, and <HI>Lazine&s;s</HI> or Want of Exerci&s;e
is joined with it, &s;o that the Acrimony of
the Salts, and the Stock of the Humours,
gradually encrea&s;e as the Solids are relaxed
and weakened: then the flower, colder, more
humorous and chronical Di&s;ea&s;es are produced,
with all the Pains, Mi&s;eries, and Torments
ari&s;ing in this low, &s;unk, and dejected State
of the Con&s;titution. From all which it is
evident, that the&s;e mon&s;trous and extreme
<HI>Tortures,</HI> are entirely the Growth of our
own Madne&s;s and Folly, and the Product of
our own wretched Inventions, from the

&sect;. III. IT is plain there is a Mineral
Source of Salts lodged in the Bowels of the
Earth, (to which the Sea owes its Saltne&s;s)
which tran&s;mits its Steams or &s;maller Par|ticles
to Minerals, Plants, and Vegetables,
and &s;eems to be the common <HI>Mother</HI> and
Origin of all the &s;everal Kinds of form'd Salts
or &s;aline Concretions, according to its different
Mixture with the other Elements, to wit,
tho&s;e of Earth, Water, Sulphur, (or perhaps
impri&s;on'd Light) and Air: There are like|wi&s;e,
po&s;&s;ibly, two Kinds of mo&s;t active Fluids,
(Air, Water, and Mercury, being combin'd
with the other pa&s;&s;ive Sub&s;tances) one we
know very little of, more than what I &s;hall
mention in a following <HI>Chapter.</HI> The
other is that of <HI>Light,</HI> which actuates and
enlivens the whole material <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of Bodies
here below, without which they would
langui&s;h, deaden, chill, and be motionle&s;s, and
this &s;eems to be the active <HI>energetick</HI> Principle,
(together with that other, which is &s;uppos'd
to be the Cau&s;e of their attractive Quality, as
well as that of all Matter, and of all the &s;ub|tile
Appearances of &s;mall Bodies on our Globe.)
Salts of one Kind or another, &s;eem to be its
pa&s;&s;ive In&s;truments, which being driven and
actuated by it, (and the other active Fluid
mention'd) produce the Appearances we ob|&s;erve
from them. Form'd <HI>Salts</HI> al&s;o are hard,
and di&s;&s;olvible only by Water, and from it,
<PB N="39" REF="77">
po&s;&s;ibly, in a great mea&s;ure, they originally
&s;pring<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Newton's</HI> Opticks.</NOTE>. They generally form them&s;elves
into regular, and &s;harp, or angular Figures,
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Gulielmini de Salium Natura.</NOTE> whereby they become more piercing and
penetrating: And this Regularity of their
Figures makes it probable, that their Parti|cles
have plain Surfaces, which accounts for
their extreme Degree of Union, or their
running eagerly into one another's Embraces,
as is evident from their Congelations and
<HI>Cry&s;talizations.</HI> The Volatility and Acti|vity
of Salts, &s;eems to ari&s;e from &s;everal
Sources: As fir&s;t, from the Smallne&s;s of their
Parts, and the Sharpne&s;s of their Angles:
Secondly, from their greater Degree of <HI>At|traction,</HI>
than is common to other Bodies of
the &s;ame Bulk: And thirdly, from their
Union with <HI>Light, Sulphur,</HI> and other <HI>&s;ul|phureous</HI>
Bodies, when they become <HI>Urinous</HI>
or <HI>Animal.</HI> It is not my Affair to detail
their Laws, or the <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> of all their
Actions, my De&s;ign being only to give &s;uch
a Sketch of the Matter, from the be&s;t Ac|counts
of Philo&s;ophy, as may be &s;ufficient to
give my Reader a general Notion of the
Force of this Argument.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. MINERAL (or the Mother) Salt
is, probably, &s;imple, and of the plaine&s;t
<PB N="40" REF="78">
Figure (perhaps a <HI>Tetrahedron</HI> of an equila|teral,
triangular <HI>Ba&s;e</HI>) which, with its Di&s;|&s;olubility
in Water, and the Influence of the
active Principle of Light, fits it to be readily
introduc'd fir&s;t into the Sub&s;tance of Vegeta|bles,
where, by the Action and <HI>Attraction</HI> of
their Tubes and Solids, and its Union with the
Sulphurs and Earths of Plants, it is advanced
one Degree farther in Activity and Volati|lity,
its Angles are rendered more Acute,
and it becomes, by Cry&s;talization a Vegetable
or fix'd Salt: But 2dly, it acquires a yet fur|ther
Degree of Smallne&s;s and Agility, when
introduc'd into animal Bodies as Food, being
there again ground and &s;ubtiliz'd by the Force
of animal Fibres and Solids, and blended with
animal Oils and Sulphurs, and thereby becom|ing
what we call properly <HI>urinous</HI> Salt: And
3dly, the la&s;t and highe&s;t Degree of Subtility
and Volatility is produc'd, when this <HI>Salt,</HI> now
in its <HI>urinous</HI> Form, becomes Food for Birds
and Bea&s;ts of Prey, or for human Creatures,
being there mix'd with, and agitated by the
lighte&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ubtil of all Oils and Sul|phurs:
And when introduced into the Habit,
in great Quantities, and urg'd or actuated
by the highe&s;t Oils and Spirits, (as happen
to the <HI>European</HI> Nations chiefly, and to tho&s;e
of the <HI>Ea&s;tern,</HI> who follow their Methods,
in Riots and Exce&s;&s;es of animal Food and
&s;pirituous Liquors) they become too &s;trong
and powerful for the tender and delicate
<PB N="41" REF="79">
Fibres, and produce the di&s;mal<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Vide Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;.</HI> No 433. A Letter from <HI>Micheli Pinelli.</HI></NOTE> Appearance
I have de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. THE Rea&s;on why <HI>mineral</HI> and
<HI>vegetable</HI> Salts, <HI>Poi&s;ons</HI> and <HI>Cau&s;ticks,</HI> have
&s;uch immediate and &s;en&s;ible Effects beyond
animal Salts, &s;eems chiefly to be owing to
their Firmne&s;s and Solidity, whereby a
greater Quantity of Salts is contain'd in the
&s;ame Space or Volume, than can po&s;&s;ibly be
of animal Salts, becau&s;e the Cement of the
fir&s;t (even when &s;ubtiliz'd) being Earth or
earthy Particles, a greater Quantity of them
are combin'd in a &s;maller Space than can be
of animal Salts, which are united with a
great Quantity of a poro&s;e and light Sulphur
only, and &s;o can neither become &s;o com|pact,
nor lodge &s;o great a Quantity of Salts
or attractive Particles in an equal Space.
For the&s;e others, when admitted into animal
Bodies, become true <HI>Cau&s;ticks,</HI> and burn up
the internal, as <HI>Cau&s;ticks</HI> do the external
Parts of Animals, as we &s;ee in <HI>Ar&s;enick,
Vitriol, Alum,</HI> &amp;c. But after the &s;everal
Degrees of <HI>Alcoholization</HI> and <HI>Subtilization</HI>
formerly mention'd, the natural Salt being
thus levigated and refin'd, and its Angles
thereby render'd more acute, and its <HI>at|tractive</HI>
Quality greater, (by the le&s;&s;ening
of its Bulk) when Motion and Volatility is
<PB N="42" REF="80">
added to it, by its Mixture with the &s;everal
Oils and Bal&s;ams, of Animals, Vegetables,
and <HI>Cannibals,</HI> (pardon the Expre&s;&s;ion) it
becomes &s;o &s;ubtil and agile, as to be able
ea&s;ily to enter into the &s;malle&s;t Tubes,
and there exert its Fury, which the gro&s;&s;er
Salts, e&s;pecially when mix'd with Earths,
are either, by their Gro&s;&s;ne&s;s, incapable of,
or, by the Violence of their Action on the
Parts they fir&s;t touch, are thrown out, upon
their fir&s;t Approach, by the dige&s;tive Organs
in convul&s;ive Vomitings.</P>
<P>&sect;. VI. THE Sum of this pre&s;ent Argument
is thus, <HI>that</HI> Salt, in its Origin, is but one;
<HI>that</HI> by Divi&s;ion its Angles are made &s;maller
and &s;harper, and its attractive Virtue greatly
increa&s;ed; <HI>that</HI> though it be the mo&s;t pene|trating
and attractive among little Bodies,
or their <HI>Sy&s;tems,</HI> and becomes, as it were,
like a <HI>Lancet</HI> or <HI>Razor,</HI> yet can neither hurt
nor de&s;troy, when &s;heath'd, or not put in
Action by &s;ome <HI>moving</HI> Principle; <HI>that</HI> this
Motion or Action is communicated to it by
the mo&s;t active and <HI>energetick</HI> of all Fluids,
Light or Sulphur, Oils or Spirits; <HI>that</HI>
when its Particles are cemented only by an
earthy Matter, &s;o that the greate&s;t Number
of them po&s;&s;ible, may be crowded into the
&s;malle&s;t Volume; it has its mo&s;t deleterious
or de&s;tructive Power on animal Bodies, but
under that Form is incapable of being re|ceiv'd
<PB N="43" REF="81">
or retain'd long in the Body for that
Effect; <HI>that</HI> after two or three Divi&s;ions
and Subtilizations, its Parts become &s;o ex|ceeding
fine, that it is thereby render'd
capable to be readily introduc'd into the
inmo&s;t Rece&s;&s;es of animal Bodies, (when
thus &s;heath'd with animal and vegetable
Oils) and in &s;mall Quantities, is not only
&s;afe, but ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for exciting
the innate Action of the Fibres and Solids,
to wit, Contraction: But <HI>that</HI> when crowded
in great or infinite Numbers and Quantities,
and received into the &s;malle&s;t and fine&s;t
Tubes, and there having Time and Lei&s;ure
to drop its Oils, it unites and cry&s;talizes in
greater Volumes and Clu&s;ters, and it thereby
acquires the Nature and Qualities of the
fir&s;t mention'd Salts or Poi&s;ons, that is, be|comes
hard, compact, and deleterious, and
acts as <HI>Poi&s;ons,</HI> or a <HI>Cau&s;tick,</HI> upon animal
Fibres and Con&s;titutions. But I am weary
of this Subject, and its tedious Detail; tho&s;e
who have Philo&s;ophy enough to under&s;tand
or receive this Doctrine, will be convinced

and few Oils or Spirits at all, at lea&s;t, that
can in any Quantity be extracted out of
them; that Plants have them only when
they come to Maturity, or rather in their
Decline, and Animals mo&s;t as they advance
from Youth, thro' Maturity towards old
Age, and &s;o are more or le&s;s grateful to the

of them, when the gro&s;&s;er Parts are thrown
off by Fermentation and Di&s;tillations. Now
if all the&s;e Con&s;iderations put together, are not
&s;ufficient to make out the true remote Cau&s;e,
and give an Account of the Origin of the&s;e

(tho' a great deal more of the &s;ame
Kind might be added) I de&s;pair of any Suc|ce&s;s
with my Reader on this Subject. To

&s;eem ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to carry on the
Animal Life and Functions in the be&s;t Manner
po&s;&s;ible for our pre&s;ent Situation on this Globe;
and it is not po&s;&s;ible to have any Food with|out
them, &s;ince even Water it&s;elf, with a Parti|cle
of Earth, if not the Origin and &s;ole Matter of
Salt, yet, at lea&s;t, is never without it; but whe|ther<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Plutarch de Sanitate tuenda &amp; de E&s;u. Carnium.</NOTE>
Animal or Vegetable Salts are mo&s;t pro|per,
every one mu&s;t judge from his own Feel|ings,
his Con&s;titution, and the Di&s;ea&s;es he is
mo&s;t &s;ubject to, or from the Judgment of his
Phy&s;ician; to make which Judgment I &s;hall
a&s;&s;i&s;t the Reader in the be&s;t Manner I can
afterwards; I think there is no Doubt to be
made, that Salts of any Kind, when too
many in too large Clu&s;ters, and of the mo&s;t
<PB N="46" REF="84">
pungent, provoking, and deleterious Nature,
have the greate&s;t Share in the Production of
tho&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es to which Mankind are expos'd
in this Life. And that therefore, in &s;ome
Di&s;ea&s;es, it is extremely fit and convenient,
to &s;upport Nature with tho&s;e Foods which
abound in them lea&s;t, and where they are of
the mo&s;t benign Nature.</P>
<P>&sect;. VIII. BUT left any one &s;hould mi&s;un|der&s;tand
what has been here &s;aid, by &s;up|po&s;ing
that I con&s;ider <HI>Salts,</HI> according to the
particular Qualities that di&s;tingui&s;h one Kind
of Salts from another, or their different Pro|perties,
whether <HI>Acid, Alkalin,</HI> or having this,
or that particular Effect upon the Palat: or the
Appearances ari&s;ing upon the Actions of the
&s;everal Kinds of Salts upon one another, and
the other Appearances ob&s;erv'd from <HI>chymical</HI>
Managements (all which peculiar and di&s;tin|gui&s;hing
Properties and Appearances, pro|bably
ari&s;e only from the different Mixtures
and Proportions of the other Elements in
their particular Compo&s;ition, or their dif|ferent
Degrees of <HI>Attraction.</HI>) For &s;ince <HI>that</HI>
particular Formation or Union with the other
Elements, and the&s;e different Qualities re&s;ult|ing
thereupon, are mo&s;tly de&s;troy'd as &s;oon
as they enter into an animal Body, and are
mix'd and blended with the animal Juices;
(at lea&s;t, no &s;uch different Kinds of Salts are
to be extracted out of the&s;e Juices) or <HI>that</HI>
<PB N="47" REF="85">
have &s;uch particular Appearances and Effects,
as they had before they were received into
the Habit: Therefore, I &s;ay, that there
may be no Room to mi&s;take my Meaning on
this Head, I &s;hall here add, that I con&s;ider
Salts only in their general Nature, as Angular,
Hard, and Attractive, and con&s;equently active
&s;olid Particles of Matter, and make u&s;e of
tho&s;e general Properties only, that are exi&s;tent
in all Kinds of Salts, whatever other pecu|liar
and di&s;tingui&s;hing Qualities any particu|lar
Kinds may have, &s;ince tho' the&s;e may
remain in them while they are in the Stomach
and Guts, where they are &s;ometimes to be
found, yet (as I have ju&s;t now &s;aid) they
are all confounded, &s;oon after they have
enter'd the Habit, and mix'd with the
Juices; for which Rea&s;on I have rejected
the Con&s;ideration of the violent and &s;udden
Effects of &s;ome Kinds of Salts, and have
only ob&s;erv'd of <HI>Salts</HI> in general, that they
are Hard, Solid, Sharp, and Angular Bo|dies,
highly Attractive, and di&s;&s;olvible by
watery Fluids, and capable of being &s;ubti|lized
or divided into &s;maller Parts, and ren|der'd
&s;harper and more volatile by different
Mixtures and Managements, which are equal|ly
applicable to all Kinds of Salts, and from
thence deduce the Effects they have, or
produce in the Fluids, or upon the Solids of
Animals, when receiv'd into the Habit. The
other Con&s;ideration of &s;pecifick Salts may
<PB N="48" REF="86">
have their &s;pecifick Effects on one another
without the Animal. But they &s;eem more
proper and adapted for philo&s;ophical than
medical Di&s;qui&s;ition.</P>

<P>&sect;. I. IF what I have advanced in the for|mer

<HI>Veri&s;imilitude,</HI> it well be no hard
Matter to account for the Frequency of
Nervous Di&s;tempers ob&s;erv'd of late Years,
beyond what they have been in former
Times. There is nothing more common,
than to hear Men (even tho&s;e, who, on
other Subjects, rea&s;on ju&s;tly and &s;olidly)
a&s;cribe their Di&s;tempers, <HI>acute</HI> or <HI>chronical,</HI>
to a wet Room, damp Sheets, catching
Cold, ill or under-dre&s;s'd Food, or eating
too plentifully of this or the other Di&s;h at a
certain Time, and to &s;uch like trivial Cir|cum&s;tances,
being unwilling to own the true
Cau&s;e, to wit, their continu'd Luxury and Lazi|ne&s;s,
becau&s;e they would gladly continue this
<PB N="49" REF="87">
Cour&s;e and yet be well, if po&s;&s;ible. And
there have not wanted learned Phy&s;icians,
who have a&s;crib'd the Frequency of the&s;e
Nervous Di&s;tempers of late, e&s;pecially among
the Fair Sex, to <HI>Coffee, Tea, Chocolate,</HI> and
<HI>Snuff:</HI> I would not affirm, that there could
be no Abu&s;es of the&s;e, otherwi&s;e innocent
Foods or Amu&s;ements, or that the&s;e men|tion'd
Circum&s;tances, and Accidents may
have no Effects, but they are &s;o Weak, In|&s;en&s;ible,
and Tran&s;itory, if they meet with
Con&s;titutions tolerably Clean and Healthy,
that whoever would attribute any con&s;ider|able
Di&s;order to them, argues with as much
Rea&s;on and true Philo&s;ophy, as he who a&s;cribes
his good Liquor intirely to the Ye&s;t or other
Helps of its Fermentation, or the Death of
a Man kill'd by a Gun-&s;hot to the Paper or
Tow that held down the Bullet: Health
and Life, however Frail and Brittle, are too
&s;trong Forts to be taken or de&s;troy'd by
&s;uch puny and in&s;ufficient Pop-gun Artillery.
The Matter, as I take it, &s;tands thus:</P>
<P>&sect;. II. SINCE our Wealth has increas'd,
and our Navigation has been extended, we
have ran&s;ack'd all the Parts of the <HI>Globe</HI> to
bring together its whole Stock of Materials
for <HI>Riot, Luxury,</HI> and to provoke <HI>Exce&s;s.</HI> The
Tables of the Rich and Great (and indeed
of all Ranks who can afford it) are furni&s;h'd
with Provi&s;ions of Delicacy, Number, and
<PB N="50" REF="88">
Plenty, &s;ufficient to provoke, and even gorge,
the mo&s;t large and voluptuous Appetite. The
whole <HI>Controver&s;y</HI> among us, &s;eems to lie in
out-doing one another in &s;uch Kinds of
Pro$u&s;ion. <HI>Invention</HI> is rack'd, to furni&s;h
the Materials of our Food the mo&s;t Delicate
and Savoury po&s;&s;ible: In&s;tead of the plain
<HI>Simplicity</HI> of leaving the Animals to range
and feed in their proper <HI>Element,</HI> witht heir
natural Nouri&s;hment, they are phy&s;ick'd
almo&s;t out of their Lives, and made as great
<HI>Epicures,</HI> as tho&s;e that feed on them; and
by <HI>Stalling, Cramming, Bleeding, Lameing,
Sweating, Purging,</HI> and <HI>Thru&s;ting</HI> down &s;uch
unnatural and high-&s;ea&s;on'd Foods into them,
the&s;e Nervous Di&s;ea&s;es are produced in the
<HI>Animals</HI> them&s;elves, even before they are
admitted as Food to tho&s;e who complain of
&s;uch Di&s;orders. Add to all this, the <HI>tor|turing</HI>
and <HI>lingering</HI> Way of taking away
the Lives of &s;ome of them, to make them
more delicious: and the Dre&s;&s;ing of them,
by culinary Torments while alive, for their
Purcha&s;er's Table: All which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;a|rily
&s;harpen, impoi&s;on, corrupt, and putrify
their natural Juices and Sub&s;tances. The
<HI>Liquors</HI> al&s;o that are u&s;ed for <HI>Vehicles</HI> to
&s;uch Food, are the highe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;piri|tuous,
the mo&s;t &s;corched by the <HI>Solar</HI> Beams,
or inflam'd by repeated Di&s;tillations, to carry
off the pre&s;ent Load, and leave a Di&s;po&s;ition
and Craving for a new one in the &s;horte&s;t
<PB N="51" REF="89">
Time po&s;&s;ible. Any one who has but a
tolerable Knowledge in <HI>Philo&s;ophy,</HI> or is
acquainted with the Animal <HI>OEconomy,</HI> can
ea&s;ily tell what the nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;equence
of &s;uch a <HI>Diet</HI> mu&s;t be in naturally weak
Habits.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. NOT only the Materials of <HI>Luxury,</HI>
are &s;uch as I have de&s;crib'd, but the Manner
of Dre&s;&s;ing or Cooking them, is carried on
to an exalted Height. The ingenious
mixing and compounding of <HI>Sauces</HI> with
foreign <HI>Spices</HI> and Provocatives, are con|triv'd,
not only to rouze a &s;ickly Appetite
to receive the unnatural Load, but to ren|der
a natural good one incapable of know|ing
when it has enough. Since <HI>French
Cookery</HI> has been in &s;uch Repute in <HI>England,</HI>
and has been improv'd from <HI>Spain, Italy,
Turkey,</HI> and every other Country that has
any thing remarkably delicious, high, or
favoury in Food; &s;ince <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Pickles and
Sauces have been brought to embelli&s;h our
continual Fea&s;ts. Dre&s;&s;ing, which was de|&s;ign'd
to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Labour of Dige&s;tion, as it
is now manag'd, not only counter-acts that
De&s;ign, but is become the mo&s;t <HI>difficult,

<P><PB N="52" REF="90">
&sect;. IV. SUCH a Cour&s;e of Life mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
beget an Ineptitude for Exerci&s;e, and
accordingly <HI>A&s;&s;emblies, Mu&s;ick Meetings,
Plays, Cards</HI> and <HI>Dice,</HI> are the only Amu&s;e|ments,
or perhaps Bu&s;ine&s;s follow'd by &s;uch
Per&s;ons as live in the Manner mention'd,
and are mo&s;t &s;ubject to &s;uch Complaints, on
which all their Thoughts and Attention,
nay, their Zeal and Spirits, are &s;pent. And
to convey them with the lea&s;t Pain and Un|ea&s;ine&s;s
po&s;&s;ible from Motion, or &s;lavi&s;h La|bour,
to the&s;e &s;till and bewitching Employ|ments:
<HI>Coaches</HI> are improv'd with Springs,
<HI>Hor&s;es</HI> are taught to pace and amble,
<HI>Chairmen</HI> to wriggle and &s;wim along, to
render the Ob&s;tructions more firm and fix'd
in the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, and to prevent all the
Secretions that would any ways lighten the
Burthen. Is it any Wonder then, that the
Di&s;ea&s;es which proceed from <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> and
<HI>Fulne&s;s</HI> of Bread, &s;hould increa&s;e in Propor|tion,
and keep equal Pace with tho&s;e Im|provements
of the Matter and Cau&s;e of Di&s;|ea&s;es?</P>
<P>&sect;. V. It is a common Ob&s;ervation, (and,
I think, has great Probability on its Side)
that <HI>Fools, weak</HI> or <HI>&s;tupid</HI> Per&s;ons, <HI>heavy</HI> and
<HI>dull Souls,</HI> are &s;eldom much troubled with
Vapours or Lowne&s;s of Spirits. The intel|lectual
Faculty, without all manner of
<PB N="53" REF="91">
Doubt, has material and animal Organs, by
which it mediately works, as well as the
animal Functions. What they are, and
how they operate, as, I believe, very few
know, &s;o it is very little nece&s;&s;ary to know
them for my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e. As a philo|&s;ophical
Mu&s;ician may under&s;tand Propor|tions
and Harmony, and yet never be in a
Condition to gratify a Company with a fine
Piece of Mu&s;ick, without the Benefit of
Sounds from proper Organs, &s;o the intel|lectual
Operations (as long as the pre&s;ent
Union between the Soul and Body la&s;ts) can
never be perform'd in the be&s;t Manner with|out
proper In&s;truments. The Works of <HI>Ima|gination</HI>
and <HI>Memory,</HI> of <HI>Study, Thinking,</HI> and
<HI>Reflecting,</HI> from whatever Source the Prin|ciple
on which they depend &s;prings, mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily require bodily Organs. Some
have the&s;e Organs finer, quicker, more agile,
and &s;en&s;ible, and perhaps more numerous
than others; <HI>Brute</HI> Animals have few o$
none, at lea&s;t, none that belong to <HI>Re|flection;</HI>
Vegetables certainly none at all.
There is no Account to be given how a
<HI>Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Fall,</HI> a <HI>Blow,</HI> a <HI>Debauch, Poi&s;ons,
violent Pa&s;&s;ions, a&s;tral</HI> and <HI>aerial</HI> Influences,
much Application, and the like, &s;hould
po&s;&s;ibly alter or de&s;troy the&s;e intellectual
Operations without this Suppo&s;ition. It is
evident, that in <HI>nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers, and a
great many other bodily Di&s;ea&s;es, the&s;e
<PB N="54" REF="92">
Faculties, and their Operations, are impair'd,
nay, totally ruin'd and extingui&s;hed to all
Appearance; and yet, by proper Remedies,
and after Recovery of Health, they are
re&s;tor'd and brought to their former State.
Now &s;ince this pre&s;ent Age has made Efforts
to go beyond former Times, in all the Arts
of <HI>Ingenuity, Invention, Study, Learning,</HI> and
all the contemplative and &s;edentary Pro|fe&s;&s;ions,
(I &s;peak only here of our own Na|tion,
our own Times, and of the better Sort,
who&s;e chief Employments and Studies the&s;e
are) the Organs of the&s;e Faculties being
thereby worn and &s;poil'd, mu&s;t affect and
deaden the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> and lay a Foun|dation
for the Di&s;ea&s;es of Lowne&s;s and
Weakne&s;s. Add to this, that tho&s;e who
are likelie&s;t to excel and apply in this Man|ner,
are mo&s;t capable, and mo&s;t in hazard of
following that Way of Life which I have
mention'd, as the likelie&s;t to produce the&s;e
Di&s;ea&s;es. <HI>Great Wits</HI> are generally great
<HI>Epicures,</HI> at lea&s;t, Men of <HI>Ta&s;te.</HI> And the
Bodies and Con&s;titutions of one Generation,
are &s;till more corrupt, infirm, and di&s;eas'd,
than tho&s;e of the former, as they advance in
Time, and the U&s;e of the Cau&s;es a&s;&s;ign'd.</P>
<P>&sect;. VI. To all the&s;e Con&s;iderations, if we
add the pre&s;ent Cu&s;tom of Living, &s;o much
in great, populous, and over-grown Cities;
<HI>London</HI> (where nervous Di&s;tempers are mo&s;t
<PB N="55" REF="93">
frequent, outrageous, and unnatural) is, for
ought I know, the greate&s;t, mo&s;t capacious,
clo&s;e, and populous City of the <HI>Globe,</HI> the
infinite Number of Fires, Sulphureous and
Bituminous, the va&s;t Expence of Tallow and
foetid Oil in Candles and Lamps, under and
above Ground, the Clouds of &s;tinking Breaths,
and Per&s;piration, not to mention the Or|dure
of &s;o many di&s;eas'd, both intelligent
and unintelligent Animals, the crouded
Churches, Church-yards and Burying Places,
with putrifying Bodies, the <HI>Sinks, Butcher-Hou&s;es,
Stables, Dunghils,</HI> &amp;c. and the
nece&s;&s;ary Stagnation, Fermentation, and
Mixture of &s;uch Variety of all Kinds of
Atoms, are more than &s;ufficient to putrify,
poi&s;on, and infect the Air for twenty Miles
round it, and which, in Time, mu&s;t alter,
weaken, and de&s;troy the healthie&s;t Con&s;titu|tions
of Animals of all Kinds; and accord|ingly
it is in &s;uch like Cities, that the&s;e
Di&s;tempers are to be found in their highe&s;t
and mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing Symptoms, and &s;eldom
any la&s;ting or &s;olid Cure is perform'd till the
Di&s;ea&s;ed be <HI>ru&s;ticated</HI> and purified from the
infectious Air and Damps, tran&s;ub&s;tantiated
into their Habits, by a great City, and till
they have &s;uck'd in and incorporated the
&s;weet, balmy, clear Air of the Country,
and driven the other out of their Habit.
For by innumerable Experiments it is cer|tain,
that the Nitre or Acid of fre&s;h, new
<PB N="56" REF="94">
Air, is as nece&s;&s;ary towards Life and Health
as fre&s;h balmy Food.</P>
<P>&sect;. VII. ALL the&s;e together will, I think,
be &s;ufficient to account for the Frequency
of <HI>Nervous Di&s;tempers</HI> of late. And, in
fact, the &s;ame Cau&s;es pretty near, have been
a&s;&s;ign'd by all Ob&s;ervers, Phy&s;icians, and
Philo&s;ophers, in all Ages and Countries, to
have produc'd &s;imilar Effects. The <HI>Egyptians,</HI>
as they &s;eem to have been the fir&s;t who cul|tivated
the Arts of Ingenuity and Politene&s;s,
&s;o they &s;eem likewi&s;e to have been the fir&s;t
who brought <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> to any tolerable Degree
of Perfection. The antient <HI>Greeks,</HI> while they
lived in their Simplicity and Virtue were
Healthy, Strong, and Valiant: But afterwards,
in Proportion as they advanced in Learning,
and the Knowledge of the Sciences, and
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves from other Nations
by their Politene&s;s and Refinement, they
&s;unk into <HI>Effeminacy, Luxury,</HI> and <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es,</HI>
and began to &s;tudy <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> to remedy tho&s;e
Evils which their Luxury and Lazine&s;s had
brought upon them. In like manner, the
<HI>Romans</HI> fell from their former Bravery,
Courage, and <HI>$eroick Virtue,</HI> which had
gain'd them the Empire of the World. As
<HI>Cel&s;us</HI> ob&s;erves, where he is giving &s;ome
Account of the Ri&s;e and Improvement of
Phy&s;ick, according to the Prevalency of the&s;e

<PB N="57" REF="95">
<HI>Intemperance; That the&s;e two had fir&s;t &s;poil'd
the Con&s;titutions of the</HI> Greeks, <HI>and after|wards
tho&s;e of his own Countrymen the</HI> Ro|mans,
<HI>when become Ma&s;ters of the Luxury as
well as the Country of tho&s;e polite People.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. VIII. IT were ea&s;y to &s;hew, from the
be&s;t Philo&s;ophy, confirm'd by the mo&s;t
&s;olid Experience, that Di&s;tempers of all
Kinds ow their more remote Origin, Cau&s;e,
and Ri&s;e to the &s;ame Principles: And that
the Pains and Trouble &s;ome have taken
to &s;earch and di&s;cover from <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> the
Occa&s;ions and Times of the Appearance of
&s;uch and &s;uch Di&s;tempers, ends only in
gathering and collecting &s;ome new Names,
which Mankind have arbitrarily be&s;tow'd
upon &s;ome particular Symptoms, Degrees,
or Paroxy&s;ms of univer&s;ally known Di&s;ea&s;es;
and that the&s;e Enquiries tho' they may
divert and amu&s;e the Enquirer and the Rea|der,
like any other Pieces of Hi&s;tory: are of
no further U&s;e or Advantage to the World,
than in &s;o far as they at the &s;ame Time di&s;|cover
the Means and Medicines by which
&s;uch Symptoms or Degrees of Di&s;tempers
were remedied or overcome. For, I think,
it is plain to a Demon&s;tration, that all Di&s;|ea&s;es
what&s;oever, by whatever Names or
Titles dignified or di&s;tingui&s;h'd, &s;o far as
they are natural and internal Di&s;tempers,
and not caus'd by Accident, mu&s;t in the
<PB N="58" REF="96">
main proceed (if we &s;uppo&s;e, as we mu&s;t,
that Mankind at fir&s;t, were Healthy and
Sound) from Intemperance, or &s;ome Error
in the Quantity or Quality of their Food,
and Lazine&s;s or Neglect of due Exerci&s;e: by
which as the Solids and Juices of the Parents
have been &s;poil'd, &s;o their Po&s;terity by con|tinuing
the &s;ame Cour&s;es have gradually &s;uf|fer'd
higher and more extreme Di&s;orders or
Symptoms, ari&s;ing from the &s;ame general
Cau&s;es: which upon their fir&s;t Appearance
receiving new Names by their Ob&s;ervers, as
new and particular Di&s;tempers, have in|creas'd
to &s;uch a Number, as to exhibit that
numerous Train of Mi&s;eries with which our
<HI>Books of Phy&s;ick</HI> and <HI>Bills of Mortality</HI> are
fill'd: And as the Age grew wor&s;e, and
the &s;ame Cau&s;es have been continued, and
con&s;equently the Con&s;titutions more de|prav'd,
not only more numerous, but higher
and more terrible Symptoms have ari&s;en, till
they have come at la&s;t to &s;uch a Degree of

Climates, a&s;tral</HI> and <HI>aerial</HI> Influences,
and many other Circum&s;tances, had any Effect
or Influence in begetting or propagating
the&s;e Di&s;tempers, but that the&s;e are &s;light,

Arguments to draw the &s;ame Conclu&s;ions.</P>

Times, at lea&s;t, might have been, if the
efficient Cau&s;es, <HI>Idlene&s;s</HI> and <HI>Luxury,</HI> had
been &s;ufficiently &s;et to <HI>work,</HI> which were
chiefly in the Power of Men them&s;elves.
What we call Nervous Di&s;tempers, were
certainly, in &s;ome &s;mall Degree, known
and ob&s;erv'd by the <HI>Greek, Roman,</HI> and
<HI>Arabian</HI> Phy&s;icians, tho' not &s;uch a Number
of them as now, nor with &s;o high Symptoms,
&s;o as to be &s;o particularly taken Notice of,
except tho&s;e call'd <HI>Hy&s;terick,</HI> which &s;eem to
have been known in <HI>Greece,</HI> from whence
they have deriv'd their Name: But as they
were probably a &s;tronger People, and liv'd
in a warmer Climate, the &s;low, cold, and
nervous Di&s;ea&s;es were le&s;s known and ob|&s;erv'd;
the Di&s;tempers of all the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI>
and <HI>Southern</HI> Countries being mo&s;tly <HI>acute.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. X. WHEN the&s;e general Cau&s;es I
have mention'd, came to exi&s;t in &s;ome more
con&s;iderable Degree, and operate in the
more <HI>Northern</HI> Climates, then the&s;e Nervous
Di&s;ea&s;es began to &s;hew them&s;elves more
eminently, and appear with higher and more
numerous, and atrocious Symptoms. <HI>Syden|ham,</HI>
our Countryman, was the Phy&s;ician of
<PB N="60" REF="98">
Note who made the mo&s;t particular and full
Ob&s;ervations on them, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd them
into a particular Cla&s;s and Tribe, with a
proper, tho' different, Method of Cure from
other chronical and humorous Di&s;tempers,
tho' their true Nature, Cau&s;e, and Cure has
been le&s;s univer&s;ally laboured and known,
than that of mo&s;t other Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;o that
tho&s;e who could give no tolerable Account
of them have call'd them <HI>Vapours, Spleen,
Flatus, Nervous, Hy&s;terical,</HI> and <HI>Hypochon|driacal</HI>
Di&s;tempers.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the true Nature of the Fibres and
Nerves.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. 1. THE Fibres are <HI>&s;mall, tran&s;pa|rent,
&s;olid,</HI> and <HI>ela&s;tick,</HI> or
&s;pringy Threads or Filaments.</P>
<P>BY <HI>Fibres,</HI> I mean here the lea&s;t and
&s;malle&s;t Threads in the Compo&s;ition, of
which many unite to make one &s;en&s;ible
<HI>Fibre.</HI> Our Hairs, which are a Kind of
<HI>Fibres,</HI> may be divided and &s;plit into a great
<PB N="61" REF="99">
Number of &s;mall ones, evident to the naked
Eye; but <HI>Leewenhoeck,</HI> by his Gla&s;&s;es, has
di&s;cover'd five or &s;ix hundred of them in
one vi&s;ible <HI>Fibre.</HI> They are <HI>tran&s;parent,</HI>
as is evident, when &s;ufficiently wa&s;h'd and
cleans'd from the Skins, Humours and Fluids
that adhere to them. The <HI>la&s;t</HI> and ultimate
<HI>Fibres</HI> mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be <HI>Solid;</HI> for a <HI>Fibre</HI>
that has a Cavity mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal
others that go to make up its Coat; but
even the &s;malle&s;t compound <HI>Fibres</HI> may be
likewi&s;e <HI>&s;olid,</HI> and con&s;i&s;t of the &s;imple ones,
as a Silk Thread is made up of the Filaments
of the raw Silk; for the be&s;t Gla&s;&s;es di&s;co|ver
no Cavity in them, at lea&s;t, they are
not fairly prov'd to be Tubular or Hollow
by the Appearance they give of &s;ome Cavi|ties,
when view'd thro' a Micro&s;cope, &s;ince
what appears to &s;ome to be &s;o, may be no
other than the Inter&s;tices between them; as
&s;eems highly probable from their lying ob|lique
to the Length of the <HI>Fibres,</HI> to which
they ought to run parallel, if the&s;e <HI>Fibres</HI>
were Tubular. But other Arguments to
confirm this &s;hall be a&s;&s;ign'd in their proper
Place. They are <HI>ela&s;tick</HI> or &s;pringy, as ap|pears
by a <HI>Fibre,</HI> or a Mu&s;cle's contracting
(when divided) towards both Extremities;
and that Heat and Puncture &s;timulate them
into involuntary Spa&s;ms and Convul&s;ions.</P>
<P><PB N="62" REF="100">
&sect;. II. ALL the Solids of the Body, when
duly prepar'd, re&s;olve them&s;elves, or may
be &s;eparated into &s;uch <HI>Fibres</HI> at la&s;t. They
are probably platted and twi&s;ted together in
the Manner I have de&s;crib'd, to make the
larger &s;en&s;ible <HI>Fibres:</HI> And the&s;e again are
either united in Bundles to form the <HI>Mu&s;cles,
Tendons, Ligaments,</HI> &amp;c. or woven into a
fine <HI>Web,</HI> like Cloth, to make the <HI>Mem|branes,</HI>
the Coats of the Ve&s;&s;els, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> only in
&s;ome the longitudinal, in others the tran&s;|ver&s;e
<HI>Fibres</HI> are larger and &s;tronger; or
the&s;e la&s;t are rolled <HI>&s;pirally,</HI> according to the
particular Office or Function de&s;ign'd to be
perform'd by them. The Structure of the
Bones &s;eems to be like that of a Piece of
Linen roll'd upon a <HI>Cylinder,</HI> thro' which
a va&s;t Number of Pins are &s;tuck perpendi|cular
to the Surface, to keep it from unrol|ling.
The&s;e, and doubtle&s;s many other,
Methods of Texture are made u&s;e of by the
Infinitely-wi&s;e Author of Nature, in the Fa|brick
of the Solids of the Animal Machin.
We mu&s;t content our &s;elves, in the Explica|tion
of the Works of Nature, with Allu|&s;ions
to tho&s;e of Art, that come neare&s;t the
Ca&s;e where philo&s;ophick Nicety is not in|tended.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. THE &s;en&s;ible or compound <HI>Fibres,</HI>
as they are found in the Structure of an Ani|mal
<PB N="63" REF="101">
Machin, are of three Kinds. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI>
Some are of a loo&s;er and &s;ofter Texture, or
of a weaker Spring and Ela&s;ticity, contract|ing
ea&s;ily and readily, and requiring only a
&s;mall Force to di&s;tend them, being moi&s;tened
with a greater Quantity of Blood; (which
makes them look red) and &s;uch are all the
<HI>Mu&s;cular Fibres,</HI> which are employed in the
Compo&s;ition of the In&s;truments of voluntary
or animal Motion, who&s;e greater Action
requires a greater Quantity of balmy, warm
Moi&s;ture, to pre&s;erve their due Degree of
<HI>Ten&s;ion,</HI> and repair their ca&s;ual and ordinary
Decays. <HI>Secondly,</HI> Others are of a clo&s;er and
more compact Di&s;po&s;ition, the &s;maller <HI>Fibres</HI>
whereof they are compos'd, being more
firmly and intimately united, and crowded
or compre&s;s'd into a &s;maller Space, in con|&s;equence
of which their <HI>ela&s;tick</HI> Force is
greater, they contract with greater Strength
and Quickne&s;s, and are with more Difficulty
di&s;tended, being moi&s;ten'd with a thinner,
more rare, milky and watery Fluid, becau&s;e
of their &s;olid Texture, to keep them from
growing rigid or hard, and &s;uch are the
Fibres of the Membranes, Tendons and
Nerves, who&s;e Compactne&s;s and clo&s;er Union
of Parts, &s;eems to be the Rea&s;on of the
greater Degree of Sen&s;ibility they are evi|dently
endued with above tho&s;e of the fir&s;t
Kind. The Motion or Impre&s;&s;ion commu|nicated
to them, being thereby le&s;s inter|rupted,
<PB N="64" REF="102">
broken or lo&s;t; and the la&s;t of the&s;e
particularly, to wit, the <HI>Nerves,</HI> are made u&s;e
of to communicate the Impre&s;&s;ion they receive
from outward Objects, or the mu&s;cular Fibres
to the <HI>Sen&s;orium</HI> in the Brain, and by it to the
&s;entient Principle or <HI>Mu&s;ician,</HI> and from it to
the Organs. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> There is yet another
Sort of the&s;e compound Fibres of a hard and
rigid Make, who&s;e <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> is like that of
Steel, and not of the &s;o di&s;tractile Kind,
like tho&s;e before mention'd, and con&s;equent|ly,
being neither fit for Sen&s;ation or Action,
they are only employ'd as a Support or
Security for the tender Solids, requiring only
a little Oil to keep them from growing too
dry or brittle; and of this Kind are the
Fibres of the Bones. Every &s;ingle Fibre has
a particular Membran involving it, like the
Bark on a Tree, and &s;ome particular Clu&s;ters
have another Membran binding the Whole.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. FROM this Account of the <HI>Fibres</HI>
in general, if ju&s;t, it is plain, that in their
original Con&s;titutions they are much the
&s;ame, and that their different Properties and
Appearances ari&s;e only out of the various
Methods of Texture employ'd in their Com|po&s;ition,
according to the U&s;es they were
intended for. It is likewi&s;e probable, that
all the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the Body (except tho&s;e of
the hard and rigid Kind, whereof the Bones
are compos'd) are &s;en&s;ible, more or le&s;s,
<PB N="65" REF="103">
according to their Den&s;ity or Clo&s;ene&s;s of
their Texture, or the Degrees of their <HI>ela&s;tick</HI>
or <HI>di&s;tractile</HI> Force, con&s;equent thereupon,
and their Communication with the Brain;
the <HI>Nerves</HI> being only &s;ome of the&s;e Fibres
the mo&s;t &s;u&s;ceptible, by their Structure of
communicating Action and Motion, made
u&s;e of to convey &s;uch Impre&s;&s;ions, as they
receive from outward Objects, or the other
Fibres (however this Intercour&s;e is carried
on between them, whether by Engrafting,
like the Blood Ve&s;&s;els, or otherwi&s;e, I &s;hall
not determin) to the Seat of the Intelligent
or &s;en&s;itive Principle, and to carry back from
thence the fir&s;t Tendency of Action to the
<HI>Mu&s;cular Fibres,</HI> when they contract or relax,
in order to the &s;everal Functions of the <HI>Ani|mal
OEconomy.</HI> To tell preci&s;ely in what
Manner this is perform'd, is, perhaps, impo&s;|&s;ible,
I am &s;ure very difficult; nor do I
think it any ways nece&s;&s;ary to what I have
to propo&s;e, concerning the Nature and Cure
of <HI>Nervous Di&s;tempers,</HI> commonly &s;o call'd.
I am of Opinion, that the&s;e Di&s;orders do not
&s;o properly depend upon one Kind of <HI>Animal
Fibres,</HI> that particularly of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> as
is commonly &s;uppos'd, unle&s;s it be in &s;mall
and Topical Di&s;orders of the nervous Kind:
but that when there are general internal
Di&s;ea&s;es, and that many of the <HI>Fibres</HI> and
<HI>Nerves</HI> &s;uffer, the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> or all the
Solids of the Body (except tho&s;e which are
<PB N="66" REF="104">
firm and hard) &s;uffer together in &s;ome De|gree
or other.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. THAT there is a certain <HI>Tone, Con|&s;i&s;tence,</HI>
and Firmne&s;s, and a determin'd
Degree of <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> and <HI>Ten&s;ion</HI> of the Nerves
or Fibres, how &s;mall &s;oever that be, (for it
mu&s;t be in &s;ome Degree even in Fluids them|&s;elves)
nece&s;&s;ary to the perfect Performance
of the <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> is, I think, with|out
all Que&s;tion, from an Exce&s;s <HI>over</HI> or
Defect <HI>under</HI> which, in &s;ome eminent De|gree,
Di&s;ea&s;es of one Kind or another
certainly ari&s;e. Tho&s;e I am chiefly con|cern'd
for in the following Treati&s;e, are
what proceeds from the Defect, or that De|gree
which falls below the ju&s;t Mediocrity
nece&s;&s;ary for perfect Health: That is, tho&s;e
Di&s;ea&s;es that en&s;ue upon a too lax, &s;eeble,
and <HI>unela&s;tick</HI> State of the <HI>Fibres</HI> or <HI>Nerves:</HI>
And that every one may, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
judge whither this be their Ca&s;e, I &s;hall
hereafter enumerate the Signs and Symptoms
that determin it, after giving the Reader
&s;ome Conjectures concerning the U&s;e of the
Fibres, and the Manner of their Functions.</P>

much greater Stre&s;s upon the Experience
<PB N="68" REF="106">
and Ob&s;ervations them&s;elves, than upon any
<HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> Rea&s;ons I, or any other, can
&s;ugge&s;t; tho', I think, they may not be
without their Evidence, when drawn from
the real Nature of Things, or from the be&s;t
Accounts of the <HI>Animal OEconomy</HI> we have
hitherto gain'd, and may &s;ometimes ap|proach
near to a Demon&s;tration in Subjects
more &s;imple, and more obvious to Sen&s;e and

<P>&sect;. II. IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, I take it for
granted, that the <HI>intelligent Principle</HI> is of a
very different, if not quite contrary, Nature
from this organical Machin which contains it;
and has &s;carce any thing in common to them,
but as they are Sub&s;tances. It is well
known to <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> what wonderful Effects,
the <HI>Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> excited by lucky or unlucky
Accidents, (which are ju&s;tly reckon'd <HI>Intel|lectual</HI>

innumerable In&s;tances demon&s;trate. I have
felt a Pul&s;e langui&s;hing, interrupting, and
ju&s;t dying away, render'd &s;trong, full, and
free by a joyful Surprize, and on the con|trary.
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Dr. <HI>Bryan Robin&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Animal OEconomy,</HI> Prop. xxi.</NOTE> Dr. <HI>Bryan Robin&s;on</HI>'s Rea&s;oning is

conclu&s;ive, and yet I &s;hall give one In|&s;tance,

an <HI>Effort</HI> of the <HI>Mind</HI> re&s;tor'd to Life once

both Parts of the Compound were one, or if
the Whole had but a material or organical
Principle, or if there were only an external
Spring of Motion and Action, the Functions
dying, expireing, and going down, the Whole
would always die and extingui&s;h. But &s;urely
no different or independent Internal Princi|ple,
could re&s;tore, invigorate and actuate the
dead or ju&s;t dying material and animal Func|tions,
as in this la&s;t Ca&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Part 3d, the Ca&s;e of Col. <HI>Town&s;hend.</HI></NOTE>. I have for|merly
&s;ugge&s;ted, that the be&s;t <HI>Similitude</HI> I
can form of the Nature and Actions of this
<HI>Principle</HI> upon the <HI>Organs</HI> of its Machin, is
that of a skilful <HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> playing on a well|tun'd
In&s;trument. So long as the In&s;trument
is in due Order, &s;o long is the Mu&s;ick perfect
and compleat in its Kind. As it weakens
or breaks, the <HI>Harmony</HI> is &s;poil'd or &s;top'd.
Some of the Parts of this In&s;trument being
more delicate than others, are &s;ooner di&s;or|der'd
or broken. The great and principal
ones, which pre&s;ide over and actuate the le&s;&s;er,
are Strong and Durable, and require a greater
<PB N="70" REF="108">
Force and Violence to di&s;order them; but
when once they are worn out, &s;poil'd, and
ruin'd, the le&s;&s;er and dependent ones are in|volv'd
in their Fate, and the <HI>Mu&s;ician</HI> mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily &s;hift his Place and Scene. It is
the Nature of all material Organs to decay
and be worn out by Time. The Divi&s;ibi|lity
of Matter, the Friction of the Parts upon
one another, and the Action of the Bodies
that &s;urround them, make this inevitable;
but Accidents, Violence, and Mi&s;manage|ment
will quicken and forward their Ruin.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. MATERIAL Objects can act no
otherwi&s;e upon material In&s;truments, than
by communicating their Action and Motion
to them, or, at lea&s;t, to the <HI>Medium,</HI> Fluid,
or &s;ubtil Matter that &s;urrounds them; that
is, material Objects can act no otherwi&s;e
upon animal Organs, but either immediately
by communicating their Action and Motion
to the&s;e Organs, and putting their con&s;ti|tuent
Parts into particular Vibrations, in|te&s;tine
Action and Reaction upon one an|other:
or mediately by the Intervention of
&s;ome <HI>&s;ubtil Fluid</HI> or Matter on which they
impre&s;s their Actions and Motions, which
are tran&s;mitted by the <HI>Medium,</HI> in the &s;ame
Manner to the Organ. Small Bodies act
upon one another in the &s;ame Manner, and
by the &s;ame Laws and Mechani&s;m, that the
<HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> of greater ones do: And he who
<PB N="71" REF="109">
would under&s;tand the Effects of little Bodies,
Fluids, or material Spirits upon greater Bo|dies,
and the Nature of the Action of their
Particles upon one another, has nothing to
do, (if he rea&s;ons ju&s;tly) but to re&s;emble
&s;mall Bodies to great, under particular Laws
and Conditions. To apply this general
Doctrine to the Ca&s;e in Hand: We may
conclude, that <HI>Smelling,</HI> for Example, is
nothing but the Action of an odorous Body,
or the Steam or Vapour emitted from it,
giving a determin'd Impul&s;e to the Nerves
or Fibres of the No&s;trils, which, by their
<HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> propagate this Vibration and
Impul&s;e, thro' their Length to the intelli|gent
or <HI>&s;entient Principle</HI> in the Brain (which
I re&s;emble to the <HI>Mu&s;ician</HI>). Again, <HI>Feeling</HI>
is nothing but the Impul&s;e, Motion, or
Action of Bodies, gently or violently im|pre&s;&s;ing
the Extremities or Sides of the
Nerves, of the Skin, or other Parts of the
Body, which by their Structure and <HI>Mecha|ni&s;m,</HI>
convey this Motion to the <HI>Sentient</HI> Prin|ciple
in the Brain, or the <HI>Mu&s;ician.</HI> La&s;tly,
<HI>Seeing,</HI> or the Perception of the Bulk,
Di&s;tance, Situation, or Colour of Objects, is
nothing but the Action of Light (a Fluid of
its own Kind) reflected or refracted from the
Surfaces of Bodies or outward Objects (&s;ome
of which &s;catter the Rays from one another,
in an infinite Variety of <HI>Angles,</HI> and &s;o by
<HI>Experience</HI> determin their <HI>Di&s;tance</HI> and
<PB N="72" REF="110">
<HI>Bulk:</HI> And tran&s;mit one Kind of Rays
more copiou&s;ly than another, to determin
their <HI>Colour</HI>) which being variou&s;ly re|fracted
in the Humours of the <HI>Eyes,</HI> are at la&s;t
united on the <HI>Retina,</HI> &s;o as there to form an
<HI>Image</HI> analogous to that of the outward Ob|ject,
which by &s;triking the Nerves of the
<HI>Retina,</HI> (in the &s;ame Manner that the Object
it &s;elf would have done) is by them tran&s;|mitted
to the <HI>&s;entient Principle.</HI> It is much
after the &s;ame Manner in all the other In|&s;truments
of the Sen&s;ations.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. WHAT is the true Cau&s;e of <HI>Ela&s;ti|city</HI>
in general, or that of the <HI>animal Fibres</HI>
and <HI>Nerves</HI> in particular, is, I think, an un|explicable
<HI>Problem,</HI> unle&s;s we admit of a
centrifugal or repelling Fluid. Even the
true Nature and Cau&s;e of <HI>Cohe&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Con|tinuity</HI>
it &s;elf was uncertain till of late, and
as yet is too general, as far as this Kind of
Fluid or &s;ubtile Spirit explains it. The
Principle of <HI>Attraction</HI> both in great and
little Bodies, is evident from innumerable
Experiments; but what the Laws of this
general Principle may be, in all <HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> of
Bodies; or what Limitations or Re&s;trictions
it may undergo, to &s;olve the particular Ap|pearances,
is, I fear, as yet imperfect. Per|haps
Generals, in Natural Philo&s;ophy, (as
well as &s;ome other Sciences) are all that we
can attain to in our pre&s;ent State (for it
<PB N="73" REF="111">
&s;eems Preci&s;ion is a Contradiction to Fini|tude).
We &s;ee indeed that Bodies of plain,
&s;mooth Surfaces, or in which many Points
come into Contact, cohere mo&s;t &s;trongly,
which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow from the
Principle of <HI>Attraction.</HI> Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI>
has &s;hewn the <HI>Analogy</HI> of Bodies flying from
one another; or their having a Principle of
<HI>Repul&s;ion,</HI> to <HI>negative Quantities,</HI> in <HI>Algebra</HI>
and <HI>Geometry,</HI> and to &s;ome other Appear|ances
in Nature: whereby he hints a proba|ble
Account of the Ela&s;ticity and the Com|pre&s;&s;ion
of the Air: And the &s;ame Manner of
Philo&s;ophi&s;ing, duly applied and &s;uited to
Circum&s;tances, will equally account for the
<HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> of all Fluids what&s;oever, and per|haps
of Solids too. There are &s;ome Experi|ments
upon Bodies, that &s;eem to prove
the real Exi&s;tence of &s;uch a Principle in Na|ture
as <HI>Repul&s;ion:</HI> for Example, (not to men|tion
others, of which there are a great
Number, that enforce the &s;ame Conclu&s;ion)
<HI>That</HI> whereby a &s;mooth <HI>Pri&s;m,</HI> rubb'd &s;trong|ly,
drives Lea&s;-Gold from it, and &s;u&s;pends
it till its Influence is withdrawn, <HI>Hawsbee</HI>'s
Experiments on an exhau&s;ted Gla&s;s <HI>Sphere</HI> or
<HI>Cylinder</HI> violently turn'd on an <HI>Axis:</HI> Water
ri&s;ing in a <HI>hyperbolick</HI> Line above the Sur|face,
and <HI>Mercury</HI> &s;ub&s;iding below it in the
&s;ame Curve, and a great many other &s;uch
Experiments. We &s;ee al&s;o, that a Body
under a circular Rotation, has a con&s;tant
<PB N="74" REF="112">
Tendency to fly off in the Tangent, which
a certain <HI>late Author</HI> has made U&s;e of to
explain <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> by (tho', I think, with
indifferent Succe&s;s). Now tho' all the&s;e
Appearances may po&s;&s;ibly be accounted for
from other Principles, different from that of
<HI>Ela&s;ticity,</HI> yet, I think, they may be &s;uffi|cient
to illu&s;trate this Principle of <HI>Repul&s;ion.
Animal</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Sub&s;tances, &s;uch as
<HI>Ivory, Whale-Bone,</HI> the <HI>Tendons</HI> and <HI>mu&s;cular</HI>
Sub&s;tances of Animals, <HI>Cork, Sponge,</HI> &amp;c.
are the mo&s;t perfectly <HI>ela&s;tick</HI> of any Bodies
known, which makes it highly probable,
that the Actions, Sen&s;ations, and Functions
of Animals and Vegetables, are owing, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, to this <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> in the Solids:
And <HI>Metalick</HI> and <HI>Mineral</HI> Bodies (as is well
known) have their ela&s;tick Properties in|creas'd
and augmented by <HI>Animal</HI> and <HI>Vege|table
Salts</HI> united with them while they are
in <HI>Fu&s;ion</HI> by Fire.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. THE mo&s;t difficult Problem in all
the Animal OEconomy, is, to give any
tolerable Account of <HI>Mu&s;cular Action</HI> or
<HI>Animal Motion.</HI> The Similitude of a Ma|chin
put into Action and Motion by the
Force of Water convey'd in Pipes, was the
readie&s;t Re&s;emblance the <HI>Lazy</HI> could find to
explain <HI>Mu&s;cular Motion</HI> by. It was ea&s;y,
from this Re&s;emblance, to forge a thin, im|perceptible
Fluid, pa&s;&s;ing and re-pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="75" REF="113">
through the Nerves, to blow up the Mu&s;|cles,
and thereby to lengthen one of their
Dimen&s;ions, in order to &s;horten the other.
On &s;uch a &s;lender and imaginary Similitude,
the precarious <HI>Hypothe&s;is</HI> of <HI>Animal Spirits</HI>
&s;eems to be built. But as their Exi&s;tence is,
I fear, precarious, &s;o, were it real, they
are not &s;ufficient to &s;olve the Appear|ances,
as &s;hall be more particularly con|&s;ider'd
hereafter. All I &s;hall further &s;ay
here, is, that this and the other ab&s;tru&s;e
Appearances in the Animal and Vegetable
Kingdoms, particularly <HI>Vegetation, Ela&s;ti|city,
Cohe&s;ion,</HI> the Emi&s;&s;ion, Reflexions and
Refractions of <HI>Light, Attraction</HI> in the
greater and le&s;&s;er Bodies, and all the other
&s;ecret and internal Actions of the Parts of
Matter upon one another, are with &s;ome
&s;hew of Po&s;&s;ibility &s;u&s;pected, and by &s;ome
Ob&s;ervations (not otherwi&s;e to be accounted
for) made not improbable by the late <HI>&s;aga|cious
and learned Sir</HI> I&s;aac Newton<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Opticks, Book III.</NOTE>, to be
owing to an infinitely &s;ubtil, ela&s;tick Fluid,
or Spirit, (as he &s;trongly expre&s;&s;es that &s;ubtil
Matter) di&s;tended thro' this whole <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI>
penetrating all Bodies with the greate&s;t
Facility, infinitely active and volatile, but
more condens'd in <HI>Vacuo,</HI> or Spaces void of
gro&s;&s;er Matter, than towards the Surfaces of
<PB N="76" REF="114">
Bodies, or in them: And by this <HI>Aether,
Spirit,</HI> or mo&s;t &s;ubtile Fluid, the Parts of
Bodies are driven forcibly together, and their
mutual attractive Virtue ari&s;es, and the other
beforemention'd Appearances are produced.
The Exi&s;tence of this <HI>&s;ubtil Fluid</HI> or <HI>Spirit,</HI>
is made probable by what he has ob&s;erv'd
of Liquors, <HI>heating</HI> and <HI>cooling,</HI> Mercury
ri&s;ing and continuing rais'd, and &s;mooth
Bodies clinging together, and requiring an
equal Force to &s;eparate them in <HI>Vacuo,</HI> or
in an exhau&s;ted Receiver, as in Air: And a
great many other Experiments have been &s;ug|ge&s;ted
not otherwi&s;e to be &s;o readily ac|counted
for. And it is probable, that tho&s;e
other mention'd Appearances may be owing
to the &s;ame Cau&s;e, &s;ince we find always
<HI>&s;imilar</HI> Effects have <HI>&s;imilar</HI> Cau&s;es, and that
Nature is frugal in <HI>Cau&s;es,</HI> but various and
manifold in <HI>Effects:</HI> But Sir <HI>I&s;aac</HI> not having
been able to make a &s;ufficient Number of
Experiments to determin all the Laws of
this Fluid, nor indeed &s;ufficient ab&s;olutely to
prove its Exi&s;tence, he leaves it to the Saga|city
of future Ages to determin them, and
to apply them to the Appearances; and
finding nothing in the Writings of other
<HI>Philo&s;ophers, Mathematicians,</HI> or <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI>
of equal Probability with this, tho' imperfect
Account of the&s;e Difficulties, I will offer the
Reader no other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Exi&s;tence of animal Spirits, and
of their U&s;e to account for animal
Motion, and the other animal Fun|ctions.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. I. THE Doctrine of Spirits, to ex|plain
the animal Functions and
their Di&s;ea&s;es, has been &s;o
readily and univer&s;ally receiv'd from the
Days of the <HI>Arabian</HI> Phy&s;icians (and higher)
down to our pre&s;ent Times, that &s;carce one
(except here and there a <HI>Heretick</HI> of late)
has call'd this <HI>Catholick</HI> Doctrine in que&s;tion.
And tho&s;e who perhaps had Courage or
Curio&s;ity enough to doubt of, or examine
the Matter, either out of Lazine&s;s, or to
avoid a tedious Way of expre&s;&s;ing them|&s;elves,
have implicitly gone into the com|mon
Dialect which is now very convenient.
The <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> at fir&s;t was but rude and imper|fect,
but having been adopted by <HI>Philo&s;o|phers</HI>
and <HI>Mathematicians,</HI> as well as <HI>Phy|&s;icians,</HI>
they have brought it to a more con|&s;i&s;tent
<PB N="78" REF="116">
and le&s;s ab&s;urd <HI>Theory. Borelli</HI> gave
it a great Countenance, by receiving it to
explain <HI>mu&s;cular</HI> Motion, in his Book <HI>De
Motu Animalium. Willis</HI> gave it all the
Advantages of Eloquence and Metaphor.
<HI>John Bernoulli</HI> has added to it a Kind of
Geometry and Calculation. And la&s;t of
all Mon&s;. <HI>des Molieres,</HI> in the <HI>Memoirs de
l'Academie Royal</HI> for 1724, has added Plain|ne&s;s,
and &s;ome Conformity to the Natural
Appearances, and taken off mo&s;t of the
common Objections. I &s;hall not tire my&s;elf,
nor the Reader, by detailing the <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> at
length, nor the &s;everal Steps by which it
has been reformed and amended. <HI>Goelike,</HI>
Profe&s;&s;or at <HI>Frankfort,</HI> in a &s;mall Treati&s;e,
has &s;olidly expos'd and ridicul'd it as far as
<HI>Borelli</HI> went, or the precedent or co-tempo|rary
Phy&s;icians: And that admirable Geo|meter
Dr. <HI>Pemberton,</HI> has, I believe, <HI>geome|trically</HI>
&s;hewn the In&s;ufficiency of what <HI>Ber|noulli</HI>
has advanced to mend the Matter, in
his Preface to Mr. <HI>Cowper</HI>'s Book on the
<HI>Mu&s;cles.</HI> I &s;hall therefore only &s;ugge&s;t
&s;ome general Reflexions, which perhaps
equally di&s;tre&s;s this <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> however improv'd
or amended.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. I WILL not urge, that the be&s;t Eyes
or Sen&s;es, however a&s;&s;i&s;ted, have not hither|to
been able to di&s;cover any Cavity in the
Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> or in the &s;mall
<PB N="79" REF="117">
Filaments into which they are divided.
That, on the contrary, as far as <HI>Leewen|hoeck</HI>
(the be&s;t Ob&s;erver doubtle&s;s) or others
who have examin'd the Matter with great
Accuracy, could perceive: they appear &s;olid,
tran&s;parent, and with broken Reflexions, even
when dry, like crack'd <HI>Gla&s;s-Wire, Horn,</HI> or
any other &s;olid Sub&s;tance, without any ap|parent
Cavity. Nor that by compre&s;&s;ing
them by <HI>Ligatures,</HI> &s;topping the Influx, or
by &s;troaking and milching their Lengths,
are any Appearances to be ob&s;erv'd like
tho&s;e in other Ve&s;&s;els, which we know do
carry Fluids in them, more than mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
happen from compre&s;&s;ing the &s;mall
Arteries that go along by them. It is true,
that by &s;topping and tying the Trunks of
the greater Nerves, the Mu&s;cle it &s;elf will
turn <HI>Paralytick</HI> and Motionle&s;s, but it will
equally do &s;o upon intercepting the Motion
or Influx of the Blood, which concludes
nothing but this, that the&s;e <HI>Nerves</HI> are
nece&s;&s;ary towards the Action of the Mu&s;cles,
whether from their carrying a Fluid, or
from their own <HI>Tonick</HI> Nature, their internal
Configuration, or any other Manner they
may act, is not thereby determin'd. And
if Probabilities could any way influence a
Fact, they mu&s;t lie on the other Side of the
Que&s;tion, &s;ince that thin and &s;oft Liquor,
which &s;eems only fit to keep them moi&s;t and
lax, rather derogates from the Exi&s;tence of
<PB N="80" REF="118">
any &s;pirituous Fluid in them proper for the
intended End. Nor, <HI>thirdly,</HI> will I urge
again&s;t it Dr. <HI>Gli&s;&s;on</HI>'s Experiment of putting
the Arm of a &s;trong, brawny Porter into a
large Tube full of Water, and fixing it clo&s;e
to his Shoulder, that the Water might not
get out, but a&s;cend into a &s;mall <HI>conical</HI> Tube,
pa&s;&s;ing out of the Side of the larger one:
whereby he found, that upon the &s;tronge&s;t
Action of the Mu&s;cles, the Water &s;ub&s;ided
and fell in the &s;mall Tube, and ro&s;e
again upon their cea&s;ing to act; from
whence he concludes, that <HI>Mu&s;cular Mo|tion</HI>
is not performed by the Inflation or
Swelling of the Mu&s;cles, but that, on the
contrary, when they are mov'd, they are
contracted into a le&s;&s;er Figure, and more com|pact
Sub&s;tance, or are hardened: which would
&s;carcely happen, if any Matter, how &s;ubtil &s;o
ever, flow'd in the Nerves, and thereby was
added to the Sub&s;tance of the Mu&s;cles: For
&s;ince the <HI>Impenetrability</HI> of Matter is demon|&s;trable,
the lea&s;t &s;uch an Addition could
effect, was, that tho' the Fluid, by its Sub|tilty,
would not &s;en&s;ibly increa&s;e the Bulk,
yet &s;urely it could not le&s;&s;en it. I &s;ay, I &s;hall
not urge the&s;e obvious Objections again&s;t this
Doctrine; becau&s;e, tho' I think they cannot
be &s;olidly an&s;wer'd, yet they may be evaded;
but &s;hall proceed to offer a few Con&s;idera|tions,
which I think equally di&s;tre&s;s it, in
<PB N="81" REF="119">
all the Improvements that have been made
on it.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. SOME have imagin'd the Nature
of this Fluid of <HI>animal Spirits,</HI> to have &s;ome
Re&s;emblance with that of Light, (the mo&s;t
&s;ubtil, active and penetrating Fluid appa|rent
in this our <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI>) which would make
them quickly penetrate, fly through, tear,
break; and con&s;ume their rare and tender
Pri&s;ons, which would be of no more U&s;e
to them, to determin them to regular
and uniform Motions, than Gla&s;s Tubes are
to Light. And were they like <HI>urinous</HI> or
<HI>inflammable Spirits;</HI> yet neither would &s;uch
&s;lender Pri&s;ons contain them any Time, or
convey them uniformly for regular Purpo&s;es.
And <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> if they were like Water or
aqueous Fluids, they could neither have
Activity nor Subtilty &s;ufficient to &s;olve the
Appearances, nor could they move with
Velocity enough to an&s;wer the Purpo&s;es of
Volition, Sen&s;ation, and voluntary or invo|luntary
Motions, under that more gro&s;s and
&s;luggi&s;h Form, and would even then ouze
thro' their containing Tubes.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. IN a Word, give them what Na|ture
you will, they will never an&s;wer the
<HI>animal Functions</HI> and Appearances. For
&s;uppo&s;e them to have any Re&s;emblance to
the other Fluids in our <HI>Sy&s;tem;</HI> if extremely
<PB N="82" REF="120">
volatile and active, they would fly away
and tear in a very &s;hort Time their contain|ing
Tubes and Canals the <HI>Nerves,</HI> and could
not receive regular Determinations from
them; and yet &s;uch they mu&s;t be, to an&s;wer
the Ends of Volition and Sen&s;ation: And
if they were gro&s;&s;er, den&s;er and le&s;s refin'd,
they would not an&s;wer quick and &s;udden
Motion, and its Ce&s;&s;ation. And they can
never be &s;uppos'd to be extremely active
and volatile, and gro&s;s, and thick at the
&s;ame Time. We find in <HI>Drop&s;ies,</HI> that a
gro&s;&s;er Fluid, than they can be &s;uppos'd to
be, will ouze in great Quantities thro' Ve&s;|&s;els
of as clo&s;e a Texture as theirs; not to
mention the &s;udden Effects of all Kinds of
Spirits (taken inwardly) upon the <HI>Nerves,</HI>
which from this Appearance mu&s;t even be
&s;uppos'd to penetrate the Sub&s;tance of the&s;e
<HI>Nerves,</HI> and yet the nervous Fluid mu&s;t
be, at lea&s;t, as &s;ubtil and penetrating as
they.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. QUICK and in&s;tantaneous, &s;trong,
and violent Motions (increas'd by adding
great Weights, as we know by Experience)
&s;eem ab&s;olutely to have determin'd the Na|ture
of animal Spirits, to that of the mo&s;t
active and volatile Kind of Fluids imaginable,
becau&s;e none el&s;e is capable of &s;o quick and
&s;trong Actions, in order to determin the
in&s;tantaneous Obedience of the Mu&s;cles to the
<PB N="83" REF="121">
Orders of the Will: And &s;uch &s;trong, violent,
and quick Motions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily make a
great Wa&s;te and Expence of the&s;e animal
Spirits, &s;o as to require a con&s;tant Supply of
&s;uch fine and &s;ubtil Parts from the Food:
And yet we find that aqueous, vegetable, and
earthy Sub&s;tances only, make up mo&s;t of
the Nouri&s;hment of tho&s;e who have the be&s;t
and &s;tronge&s;t Spirits, and live in a con&s;tant
Cour&s;e of &s;uch Action; and the animal Heat,
employ'd to generate them, ri&s;es no higher
than that of Vegetation or Incubation only,
which is not &s;ufficient for any other Kinds of
Spirits, inflammatory or urinous. <HI>But</HI> how
any Fluid at all, of what Kind &s;oever, can be
&s;uppos'd or imagin'd to go backwards and for|wards
in the &s;ame indivi&s;ible In&s;tant almo&s;t,
(to convey Pain, for Example, to the &s;entient
Principle, and mu&s;cular Action at the &s;ame
In&s;tant, to &s;hut the Eyes upon Appearances
of Danger, or to actuate all the Mu&s;cles
nece&s;&s;ary for running away under a <HI>Panick,</HI>
and a thou&s;and other In&s;tances that may be
given) &s;eems very hard to explain from the
Nature of Fluids known here below.</P>
<P>&sect;. VI. THE Exi&s;tence of animal Spirits,
has been chiefly contriv'd to &s;olve the Appear|ances
of <HI>nervous Di&s;tempers, viz.</HI> Ob&s;tructions
of the Nerves, or their Incapacity to act
under &s;ome Circum&s;tances. Now if the&s;e
Appearances can be accounted for, more
<PB N="84" REF="122">
conformably to the <HI>Analogy</HI> of Nature without
this Suppo&s;ition than by it, then the Di&s;pute
will be at an End, and they u&s;ele&s;s. Of this
la&s;t the Reader will be a better Judge, when
he has con&s;ider'd the whole of this Treati&s;e.
As to the Ob&s;tructions of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> &s;ince
they are plainly <HI>cylindrical,</HI> (or nearly &s;uch)
it does not &s;eem agreeable to <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> that
any Fluid &s;hould readily be ob&s;tructed in
them. For whatever Fluid, of whatever
Nature, can enter the one Extremity in the
<HI>Brain,</HI> will move on by the &s;ame Impul&s;e to
the other. For <HI>Example,</HI> a Ball of the &s;ame
or le&s;s <HI>Diameter</HI> than the Cavity of a <HI>cylin|drical</HI>
Tube will move (by the Force fir&s;t im|pre&s;s'd)
from one End to the other, without
Stop or Hindrance from the Tube; unle&s;s it
be from external Accidents or Brui&s;es altering
the Figure of the Tube; and the &s;ame may
be concluded of any Fluid: which makes <HI>Ob|&s;tructions</HI>
pretty unaccountable in <HI>cylindrical</HI>
Tubes: Be&s;ides, it is no &s;mall Prejudice
again&s;t any Fluids moving in the nervous
Fibres, even that their Figure is <HI>cylindrical;</HI>
for we &s;ee in all Tubes that contain Fluids,
(as the <HI>Veins, Arteries,</HI> and <HI>Lympheducts</HI>)
to accelerate the Motion of the Fluid,
their internal Figure is <HI>conical,</HI> or tapering,
or nearly &s;o, which readily accounts for the
Ob&s;tructions in the&s;e la&s;t mention'd Ve&s;&s;els;
and it is not improbable, that Nature, which
is always &s;imilar or con&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf, had
<PB N="85" REF="123">
the Nerves been de&s;ign'd to carry a Fluid,
would have hollow'd them in this Form.
And, on the contrary, the frequent Ob&s;truc|tions
that happen in tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, which are
of this mention'd <HI>conical</HI> Figure, and the
Hardne&s;s of &s;uch Ob&s;tructions, may be &s;uffi|cient
to account for the Ob&s;tructions of the
<HI>Nerves</HI> them&s;elves. From all which we may,
I think, pretty firmly conclude, that the No|tion
of <HI>animal Spirits</HI> is of the &s;ame Leaven
with the <HI>&s;ub&s;tantial Forms</HI> of <HI>Ari&s;totle,</HI> and
the <HI>coele&s;tial Sy&s;tem</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. VII. PERHAPS there may be in Nature
material Sy&s;tems of Fluids of &s;everal Degrees
of Rarity and Subtilty, even indefinitely many
and different. What makes it not impo&s;&s;ible,
that there may be more &s;uch <HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> of &s;ubtil,
ela&s;tick Fluids, than that mention'd <HI>Aether</HI>
de&s;crib'd by Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> is, that the
<HI>Ela&s;ticity, Attraction,</HI> and other Qualities of
this <HI>Newtonian aether,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be
caus'd by &s;ome other more <HI>aetherial</HI> and &s;ubtil
Fluid, el&s;e we mu&s;t admit <HI>Ela&s;ticity, Attrac|tion,</HI>
and <HI>Activity</HI> in the Particles con&s;titute|ing
this <HI>Newtonian Aether</HI> without a Cau&s;e;
or we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the&s;e Qualities innate to
them, and to have been impre&s;s'd on them
immediately by the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> and <HI>&s;upreme Cau&s;e.</HI>
And thus we are nece&s;&s;arily thrown into one
or other of the two <HI>Horns</HI> of this <HI>Dilemma,</HI>
either to admit of Fluids de&s;cending <HI>in infi|nitum,</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="124">
in Tenuity and Subtilty, to produce
<HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> and <HI>Attraction,</HI> or allow Particles
of Matter impre&s;s'd with the&s;e Qualities in
their Creation immediately by the <HI>&s;upreme
Being.</HI> It is true, this <HI>Newtonian Aether</HI>
advances us one Step further into the Nature
of Things; but here we mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
&s;top, the Works of <HI>God</HI> appearing literally
In&s;crutable to Perfection. A few of the fir&s;t
Steps we may go in this <HI>infinit Progre&s;&s;ion,</HI>
but in all the Works of <HI>God</HI> there is a <HI>ne plus
ultra;</HI> perhaps it may be in the inanimate
material <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of Things, as it is mo&s;t cer|tainly
in the <HI>Animal</HI> Kingdom, that Nature and
its Author, to di&s;tingui&s;h it&s;elf from finite
<HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> always operates by <HI>Sy&s;tems</HI> and
<HI>Organs</HI> in Number even infinite, if not <HI>infinite</HI>
in the highe&s;t Sen&s;e, yet certainly indefinite or
<HI>infinite</HI> in a <HI>relative</HI> Sen&s;e, and in Regard to a
finite Capacity; and thus he leaves <HI>Images</HI> and
<HI>Signatures</HI> of him&s;elf on all his Works, as is
manife&s;t in <HI>Quantity, Time,</HI> and <HI>Motion,</HI> and

&sect;. VIII. To conclude this dark Subject of
<HI>animal Spirits,</HI> if they mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd, we
may affirm they cannot be of the Nature of
any Fluid we have a Notion of, from what
we &s;ee or know. Indeed, the large Size, the
wonderful Texture, and the great Care and
Security Nature has employ'd about the <HI>Brain,</HI>
makes it probable it has been de&s;ign'd for the
<HI>noble&s;t</HI> U&s;es, <HI>viz.</HI> to be the Temple or <HI>Sen|&s;orium</HI>

that it may have U&s;es <HI>analogous</HI> to
tho&s;e. But how to a&s;&s;ign them, explain, or
accord them with what has been &s;ugge&s;ted

not the infinite Windings, Convolutions, and
Complications of the Beginning of the Nerves
which con&s;titute the Brain, &s;erve to determin
their particular <HI>Tone, Ten&s;ion,</HI> and con&s;e|quently
the Inte&s;tin Vibrations of their Parts?
May they not have interwoven Blood Ve&s;&s;els

&s;often, moi&s;ten, and continue their <HI>Ela&s;ticity,</HI>
and innate Mechanick Powers through the

<HI>Vibrations</HI> be propagated through their Lengths
by a &s;ubtile, &s;pirituous, and infinitely ela&s;tick

they fall not into nervous Di&s;orders, which
anointing their Hair with &s;weet Oils, or
<PB N="101" REF="139">
wa&s;hing their Heads with Honey-Water
will &s;carce prevent.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. OTHER things being equal, tho&s;e
of the faire&s;t, cleare&s;t, and brighte&s;t colour'd
Hair, are of the loo&s;e&s;t and weake&s;t State
of Fibres and Nerves, not only becau&s;e the
faire&s;t and lighte&s;t is the mo&s;t rare, tran&s;pa|rent,
and fungous, but becau&s;e Bodies of
the lighte&s;t Parts, con&s;i&s;t of Parts of a weaker
Union, which adhere with le&s;s Force, and
con&s;equently are le&s;s ela&s;tick, firm, and
&s;pringy than tho&s;e of the darker and more
opake Colours. We generally ob&s;erve, that
People of very fine and white Hair, e&s;pe|cially
if &s;o after they are come to Maturity, are
of weak, tender, and delicate Con&s;titutions:
And tho&s;e who deal in making artificial
Covers for the Heads of Men or Women,
find that &s;uch Hair will never, with any
Credit to them, &s;erve the&s;e Purpo&s;es, and
&s;eldom hone&s;tly employ it for that End.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. THOSE of large, full, and (as
they are call'd) ma&s;tiff Mu&s;cles, and of big
and &s;trong Bones, are generally of a firmer
State of Fibres, than tho&s;e of little Mu&s;cles
and &s;mall Bones, becau&s;e the Mu&s;cles and
Bones being &s;imilar to the Fibres, and made
of them, the&s;e being bigger and &s;tronger,
&s;o mu&s;t tho&s;e be; and, on the contrary,</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="140">
&sect;. V. SOFT and yielding, loo&s;e and
flabby Fle&s;h and Mu&s;cles, are &s;ure Symp|toms
of weak and relaxed Nerves or Fibres,
as hard, firm, prominent and brawny Mu&s;|cles
and Fle&s;h are con&s;tant Signs of firm
Fibres.</P>
<P>&sect;. VI. A WHITE, fair, blanch'd, wax
or a&s;hen-colour'd Complexion, con&s;tantly
indicates a weaker State of Fibres, than a
ruddy, brown, or dark Hue.</P>
<P>&sect;. VII. A FAT, corpulent, and phlegma|tick
Con&s;titution is always attended with
loo&s;e, flabby, and relax'd Fibres, by their
being di&s;&s;olv'd and over-&s;oak'd in Moi&s;ture
and Oil, e&s;pecially if it belong to young
Per&s;ons, or happen long before the <HI>Meridian</HI>
of Life; for in the Decline, when the Fibres
have acquir'd their utmo&s;t Degree of Ten|&s;ion,
Hardne&s;s, and Firmne&s;s, it then &s;erves
to pre&s;erve them in that State, from the
Dryne&s;s that old Age always introduces.
But tho&s;e of a dry, firm, clean, and brawny
Make have generally the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t
ten&s;e Fibres.</P>
<P>&sect;. VIII. THOSE who are &s;ubject to Eva|cuations
of any Kind, in any Degree greater
than what is natural and common to &s;ound
Con&s;titutions; or tho&s;e, who by any Acci|dent,
<PB N="103" REF="141">
a Fever, or any acute Di&s;temper what|&s;oever,
have &s;uffer'd long under any preter|natural
Evacuation, are already, or &s;oon
will, become &s;ubject to a loo&s;e, relax'd, or
weak State of Fibres and Nerves: Tho&s;e
who frequently run into Purging and Co&s;tive|ne&s;s
alternately, or into Floods of pale
Water, or into profu&s;e Sweatings, upon little
or no Exerci&s;e, into a con&s;tant Spitting or
Salivation at the Mouth, or too plentiful
Di&s;charges from the No&s;e and Eyes: Tho&s;e
who have lo&s;t much Blood, or frequently
fall into <HI>Haemorrhages:</HI> Tho&s;e who have
labour'd long under an ob&s;tinate <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI>
or Loo&s;ene&s;s: Or tho&s;e of the Sex who have
purified long in greater Quantities, or oftener
than is u&s;ual or natural: All the&s;e originally
are, or commonly become of weak and relax'd
Nerves, and &s;uffer under them.</P>
<P>&sect;. IX. THOSE who are naturally of a
cold Con&s;titution, are apt to fall into Chil|ling
and Coldne&s;s on their Extremities, or
feel frequently like the trickling of cold
Water over &s;ome Parts of the Body, are
ready to catch Cold, upon the &s;lighte&s;t Oc|ca&s;ions,
are apt to run into Rigours and
Shiverings upon a &s;harp North-Ea&s;t Wind;
are too &s;en&s;ibly and violently affected, and
feel too much Pain and Unea&s;ine&s;s from cold
or fro&s;ty Weather; who want too much
Covering, Cloaths, or Heat; or, on the
<PB N="104" REF="142">
contrary, are too much &s;unk and di&s;-&s;pirited,
&s;pent and wa&s;ted with exce&s;&s;ive hot Wea|ther,
are all of loo&s;e and weak Fibres. For
all the&s;e are Signs of a too &s;low Circulation and
Per&s;piration which manife&s;t a weak Spring
in the Fibres of the Coats of the Ve&s;&s;els, and
of the other Solids, and &s;hew too great a
Degree of Sen&s;ibility or Ea&s;ine&s;s of being
acted upon by external Objects, which
argues a Weakne&s;s or Slenderne&s;s in them,
either natural or acquir'd.</P>
<P>&sect;. X. THOSE who are &s;ubject to acute
or chronical Di&s;tempers of the cold and vi&s;cid
Kind, tho' they have not commonly their
Denomination from nervous Di&s;tempers, &s;uch
as an <HI>Atrophy, Drop&s;y, Diabetes, Diarrhoea,</HI>
white and <HI>leucophlegmatick</HI> Swellings upon
the Joints or other Parts of the Body; glan|dulous
and <HI>&s;chirrous</HI> Tumours, the <HI>Scrophula,</HI>
vi&s;cid Quin&s;eys or Swellings in the Glands
of the Eyes, &s;uch (be&s;ides all tho&s;e who are
&s;ubject to Di&s;ea&s;es denominated Nervous in
their Kind) are all of weak Nerves and
Fibres.</P>
<P>&sect;. XI. THOSE who Stutter, Stammer,
have a great Difficulty of Utterance, &s;peak
very Low, lo&s;e their Voice without catch|ing
Cold, grow Dumb, Deaf, or Blind, with|out
an Accident or an Acute Di&s;temper; are
quick, prompt, and pa&s;&s;ionate; are all of
<PB N="105" REF="143">
weak Nerves; have a great Degree of Sen&s;i|bility;
are quick Thinkers, feel Plea&s;ure or
Pain the mo&s;t readily, and are of mo&s;t lively
Imagination.</P>
<P>&sect;. XII. THESE are, at lea&s;t, the mo&s;t mate|rial
of the Signs and Symptoms of a relax'd
State of Solids or Fibres; &s;o that whoever
labours under them for any Time, or in any
eminent Degree, may certainly conclude,
whatever other Di&s;orders he may labour
under, that the&s;e are certainly attended with
a State of loo&s;e and relax'd Fibres, and
con&s;equently, that in pre&s;cribing Medicines
for &s;uch, whatever their Di&s;ea&s;e otherwi&s;e
may be, or may be call'd, great Care is
always to be had, both in do&s;ing the proper
Medicines for &s;uch particular Di&s;orders, and
joining with them &s;uch Medicines as may
keep up the due Ten&s;ion of the Solids, as
much as po&s;&s;ible, while they are under the
Cure, and al&s;o ordering &s;uch Remedies as
may corroborate and &s;trengthen them, when
the Cure is effected. For in all &s;uch Ca&s;es,
where the Solids are greatly relax'd, the
Con&s;titution of the Patient differs as much
from the &s;ame Ca&s;e in &s;trong and robu&s;t Per|&s;ons,
as the Con&s;titution of a Child, from
that of a grown Per&s;on.</P>
<P>&sect;. XIII. BUT the fundamental Propo&s;ition,
on which the Manner of treating &s;uch Di&s;tem|pers
<PB N="106" REF="144">
is, and ought in Rea&s;on to be grounded,
and which Experience always ju&s;tifies, is,
that a Laxity, Weakne&s;s and Want of due
Tone and Ela&s;ticity in the Solids, produce
vi&s;cid, &s;harp, and ill-condition'd Juices. And,
on the contrary, that ill-condition'd, &s;harp,
and vi&s;cid Juices, nece&s;&s;arily produce weak
and unela&s;tick Solids, &s;o that they mutually
exa&s;perate each other, and differ only as
Cau&s;e and Effect, tho' the Fault of the Fluids
always precedes that of the Solids. Put the
Ca&s;e, that the Blood and Juices are vi&s;cid,
&s;harp, and ill-condition'd, the Fibres &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ing
nearly in their proper Ten&s;ion and due
Degree of <HI>Tone</HI> and Ela&s;ticity, that they
ought to be in perfectly &s;ound and robu&s;t
Per&s;ons, the nece&s;&s;ary Effect of &s;uch a State
of Juices, would be a Retardment of their
Circulation by a greater Pre&s;&s;ure upon the
Sides of the Ve&s;&s;els, and the forming of Ob|&s;tructions
in the &s;mall and capillary Tubes,
which by rendering the&s;e impervious, forces
a greater Quantity upon the pervious ones,
than they are accu&s;tomed or able to drive
about, and &s;o by Degrees break and loo&s;en
the Texture, and relax the Tone of all the&s;e
Solids. For when once the Ballance be|tween
the Force and Strength of an In&s;tru|ment,
and the Body to be moved by it,
comes to be de&s;troy'd, and the Advantage
thrown upon the Side of the Body to be
moved, the In&s;trument mu&s;t be &s;oon &s;hatter'd
<PB N="107" REF="145">
and broken. On the other hand, &s;uppo&s;ing
the Juices &s;ound and good, and of a due
Con&s;i&s;tence and Bal&s;am, but that the Solids
are of a laxer, weaker and le&s;s ela&s;tick Make
than they &s;hould be, it mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fol|low,
that the Circulations, Per&s;piration, the
Dige&s;tions and Secretions mu&s;t be weaker
and more langui&s;hingly perform'd than they
ought to be, by which neither will the Food
be &s;ufficiently broken and dige&s;ted in the
alimentary Tubes, nor the Size of the Par|ticles
of the Blood &s;ufficiently &s;mall nor
divided by the Force of the Circulation, nor
its Recrements thrown off with due Force
and in &s;ufficient Quantity, that the Juices
may be duly purified, in&s;omuch, that they
mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily become vi&s;cid and &s;harp;
and their Parts nece&s;&s;arily increa&s;e in Bulk
and Hardne&s;s, e&s;pecially under a <HI>mal-Regi|men.</HI>
From all which it is evident that a
weak State of Nerves or Fibres mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
imply a bad State of Juices, and &s;o on
the other Hand, and that they mutually at|tend
or produce one another, unle&s;s a proper
Regimen of Dyet come in to their Relief.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the general Method of Cure of
Nervous Di&s;tempers.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. I. _THERE are &s;ome Per&s;ons,
who, being far advanced in
Age, have not &s;ufficient Time
remaining for a perfect Cure;
and others, in whom the Di&s;|ea&s;e
is &s;o deeply rooted, by a bad Con&s;titu|tion,
derived to them from their Parents,
that they are not capable of a total Cure;
and both the&s;e mu&s;t be contented to &s;ubmit
to the <HI>Orders of Providence,</HI> and make the
<PB N="112" REF="148">
be&s;t of their Misfortunes, re&s;ting &s;atisfied
with a <HI>Partial</HI> or <HI>Palliative</HI> Cure, and re|lieving
the Symptoms as they ari&s;e. But
tho&s;e who are in better Circum&s;tances, will
have better Succe&s;s, by following with Pa|tience
and Per&s;everance, the Directions here
to be laid down.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. FROM what has been &s;aid in the
former Part of this Treati&s;e, concerning the
Sources and Cau&s;es of Chronical Di&s;tempers,
and the general Cau&s;es of the Di&s;orders of the
<HI>Nerves</HI> or <HI>Solids,</HI> there will ari&s;e three <HI>Indi|cations</HI>
in the Cure of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers,
from the three principal <HI>Cau&s;es</HI> concurring
towards their Production.</P>
<P>1<HI>&s;t,</HI> THE fir&s;t <HI>Intention,</HI> and that which
has the greate&s;t Influence on all the re&s;t, and
will often, in &s;maller Degrees of this Di&s;tem|per,
or when the Solids are not much weaken'd
or &s;poil'd, render the other two unnece&s;&s;ary:
(at lea&s;t, in a great mea&s;ure) The fir&s;t <HI>Inten|tion,</HI>
I &s;ay, will be to thin, dilute, and &s;weeten
the whole Ma&s;s of the Fluids, to de&s;troy their
Vi&s;cidity and Glewine&s;s, to open the Ob&s;truc|tions
thereby generated, make the Circulation
full and free, the Per&s;piration current, and the
Secretions flow in their due Proportion and
Tenor. This, if fully obtained, lays the
Foundation of all the re&s;t of the Cure, and
will even, during that Time, take off the
<PB N="113" REF="149">
Violence of the <HI>Symptoms,</HI> and make their
Intervals greater.</P>
<P>2<HI>dly,</HI> THE <HI>&s;econd Intention</HI> will be to
divide, break and di&s;&s;olve the &s;aline, acrid
and hard <HI>Concretions,</HI> generated in the &s;mall
Ve&s;&s;els, and to de&s;troy all <HI>Sharpne&s;s</HI> and
<HI>Acrimony</HI> lodged in the Habit, and to make
the Juices &s;oft, &s;weet, and bal&s;amick. This
will be more readily effected, if the fir&s;t <HI>In|tention</HI>
has been &s;ufficiently and &s;ucce&s;sfully
pur&s;ued; and, indeed, will, in a great mea|&s;ure,
be fulfilled by it; for as it is the Sizy|ne&s;s
and Sharpne&s;s of the Juices, that retards
the Circulation, ob&s;tructs the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els,
and thereby leaves the &s;tagnated Juices to
corrupt and putrify, by giving Time and
Occa&s;ion for the &s;maller <HI>&s;aline</HI> Particles to
approach nearer one another, exert their in|nate
Quality of <HI>Attraction</HI> and <HI>Cry&s;tallization,</HI>
and unite in greater Clu&s;ters and larger <HI>Con|cretions,</HI>
(which, tho' never &s;en&s;ible, yet,
from the Nece&s;&s;ity of Nature and its Laws,
is never the le&s;s real) &s;o when the Blood is
made &s;ufficiently thin and fluid, the&s;e &s;aline
Concretions, will be either di&s;&s;olv'd or bro|ken,
by the Thinne&s;s of the Juices, and the
Force of the Circulation, and &s;o fitted to be
thrown out of the Habit, by the proper
Di&s;charges, or will be kept at a due Di&s;tance
from one another, or more ea&s;ily reach'd,
<PB N="114" REF="150">
and then remedied by &s;uch Medicines as will
produce this Effect.</P>
<P>3<HI>dly,</HI> THE <HI>third</HI> and la&s;t <HI>Intention</HI> in
order, is to re&s;tore the <HI>Tone</HI> and <HI>ela&s;tick</HI>
Force, to cri&s;p, wind up, and contract the
<HI>Fibres</HI> of the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem,</HI> which is the la&s;t,
and indeed the mo&s;t imperfect Part of the
Cure, and the lea&s;t, I am afraid, in the
Power of <HI>Art.</HI> It is much like the Ca&s;e of
<HI>Hair</HI> that has lo&s;t its Buckle, by Length of
Time and much U&s;e; tho' by <HI>Art</HI> it may
be harden'd, &s;tiffen'd, and reduced in &s;ome
Degree to a greater Firmne&s;s and proper
Figure, yet will not retain it long, nor bear
the Injuries of the Weather &s;o readily, with|out
returning to its former Laxity: If this
could be always and totally effected, the
Cure would be a true <HI>Rejuvene&s;cence,</HI> and no
Body needed grow Old or Die. But the
Laws of Mortality will &s;uffer this Intention
to ri&s;e only to a certain Height, and no
further; for this, if &s;olidly and fully effected,
would be the true <HI>Cyclus Meta&s;yncriticus</HI> of the
Antients, &s;o little under&s;tood. However, there
are not wanting Means to effect this Purpo&s;e in
&s;ome Degree, if duly and judiciou&s;ly cho&s;en,
e&s;pecially if the Per&s;on is under the <HI>Meridian</HI>
of Life, while Nature has Warmth and Vi|gour
to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Art.</HI> After that <HI>Date</HI> the Dif|ficulty
is greater, there remaining little more
than the A&s;&s;i&s;tances of <HI>Art,</HI> upon the Signs
<PB N="115" REF="151">
of Laxity, to cri&s;p, wind up, corrugat, and
contract the Fibres of the feeble and relax'd
Solids from Time to Time as they drop.
There is certainly an innate <HI>Firmne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Force</HI>
in the Solids, which, tho' Age hardens and
&s;tiffens, yet the <HI>Tone</HI> and <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> is not
augmented thereby in Proportion: But this
<HI>Tone</HI> is &s;carce ever &s;o much broken and lo&s;t,
but that it is &s;ufficient to circulate well-thin'd
and &s;weeten'd Juices, and to perform all the
animal and intellectual <HI>Functions:</HI> and if Care
be taken to keep up the Juices in this middling
State of Fluidity and Sweetne&s;s, the Party will
be free from all great Pain or violent Di&s;order,
and will be &s;ubject only to &s;ome tran&s;ient
Lowne&s;s or Weakne&s;s, which may be pre|&s;ently
remedied, or to the unavoidable Infir|mities
of <HI>Age</HI> and <HI>Mortality.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. III. THESE are the general <HI>Intentions,</HI> to
be pur&s;ued towards a <HI>total</HI> and perfect Cure
of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders of whatever Sort or
Kind; nor are they ever to be confounded
or blended, at lea&s;t, not in the fir&s;t Attempts
towards &s;uch a Cure: For as in diluting
the Juices, unle&s;s the Solids are left to
their innate Force only, the Medicines em|ployed
for that Purpo&s;e, being <HI>active</HI> or <HI>pon|derous,</HI>
and tho&s;e which are employed to
re&s;tore the <HI>Tone</HI> of the Solids being a&s;tringent,
mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure again thicken the
Juices, and &s;o if mixed and blended toge|ther,
<PB N="116" REF="152">
mu&s;t unavoidably interfere with, coun|ter-act,
and de&s;troy the Effects of each other.
And therefore the&s;e three <HI>Intentions</HI> I have
mention'd mu&s;t religiou&s;ly follow one another,
in the order I have propos'd them, in deep <HI>Ca|chexy</HI>'s
e&s;pecially, to effect this Purpo&s;e of a
<HI>total</HI> Cure: Not that I mean, that they &s;hould
never be interrupted nor combined with each
other, for &s;ome &s;mall Time at lea&s;t, and as
it were, &s;or the Patient to take Breath and
recover Spirits a little, in order to the fur|ther
pro&s;ecuting the &s;everal Intentions. Nor
that they may not be gone on with entirely,
in a mix'd and blended Manner, both in Me|thod
and Medicines, in &s;light Ca&s;es, and the
low Degrees of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders, with good
Succe&s;s; but that in ob&s;tinate, deep, and
dangerous Ca&s;es of this Kind, from an univer|&s;ally
&s;poilt Con&s;titution, every <HI>Intention</HI> is
to be pur&s;ued, by it &s;elf for a due Time,
without Confu&s;ion or interfering with one
another, more than the Pro&s;ecution of the
then <HI>Intention</HI> requires, till the Effect is
obtained.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. WHAT the Time nece&s;&s;ary for
each <HI>Intention</HI> mu&s;t be, it is impo&s;&s;ible ab|&s;olutely
to determine; that mu&s;t be pro|portion'd
to the Violence of the <HI>Symptoms,</HI>
and the Ob&s;tinacy of the Di&s;temper. But
to give &s;ome general Idea or Notion of the
Time: That which is nece&s;&s;ary for the fir&s;t
<PB N="117" REF="153">
<HI>Intention,</HI> may be conjectur'd from the State
of the Blood. If the Size on the Top is
much gone, if the Colour and its ea&s;ily
yielding to any dividing In&s;trument, and
the Proportion of the <HI>Serum</HI> to the globular
Part, upon bleeding (a few Ounces only for
the Trial) be &s;uch as they are found com|monly
in &s;ound Per&s;ons, and if the <HI>Serum</HI>
be clear, or not too tawny, then may it be
concluded, that the fir&s;t <HI>Intention</HI> has been
pur&s;ued &s;ufficiently. The <HI>&s;econd</HI> may al&s;o
be gue&s;s'd from the healing up and cicatri|zing
of any Ulcers, Sores, or the Cure of any
<HI>cutaneous</HI> Foulne&s;&s;es, and the Removal of
any acute Pains and <HI>Paroxy&s;ms,</HI> principally
caus'd by the Sharpne&s;s, and <HI>Acrimony,</HI> and
<HI>Saline</HI> Quality of the Juices. The <HI>la&s;t</HI> is ob|vious,
after the&s;e two are a&s;certain'd by the
<HI>Strength, Vigour, Vivacity,</HI> and <HI>Freedom of
Spirits,</HI> the natural and ea&s;y Performance of
all the <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> nece&s;&s;arily follow|ing
upon the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Intention's being pro&s;ecuted
for a due Time, and in a proper Manner. But
that every one may more certainly judge of
the State and Condition of the Blood and
Juices, and the Nece&s;&s;ity of pro&s;ecuting the
<HI>Intentions</HI> I have propos'd, I &s;hall here give
&s;ome general Account of the different Changes
that happen in them under Di&s;ea&s;es of all

&sect;. V. THE <HI>Blood</HI> as it flows in the greater
or larger Ve&s;&s;els by the ordinary Cour&s;e of
the <HI>Circulation,</HI> &s;eems to be a pretty uniform
Ma&s;s, much like Cow-Milk; but when
drawn out of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els, and left without
Heat or Motion to &s;ettle in the Air, it
&s;eparates into two Parts, one of a more gluti|nous
and Solid Texture, call'd the <HI>Globular,</HI>
and the other of a more thin and fluid Na|ture,
called the <HI>Serous</HI> Part; and both the&s;e
are found in different Proportions, and of
different Natures, Con&s;i&s;tence, and Colours,
according to the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Per&s;ons in
whom they are found. I &s;hall only here
mention <HI>three</HI> of the&s;e different States, where|in
the di&s;tingui&s;hing Marks are mo&s;t evident,
tho' there are many intermediate Degrees
between the&s;e, which it were endle&s;s to enu|merate;
but the&s;e will include them all, and
are the mo&s;t general, remarkable, and u&s;e|ful:
1<HI>&s;t.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, when the <HI>globular</HI> Part
is of a Moderate Cohe&s;ion and Firmne&s;s of
Parts, in a pretty equal Proportion to its
<HI>Serum,</HI> and of a red and &s;carlet Colour,
when expos'd a due Time to the Air; and
the <HI>Serum</HI> is about the Con&s;i&s;tence of com|mon
Water, pretty clear, and almo&s;t in&s;ipid,
or, at lea&s;t, not biting &s;alti&s;h. This I take
to be pretty near the State of the &s;ounde&s;t
and be&s;t Blood. 2<HI>dly,</HI> The <HI>&s;econd</HI> State I
would mention, is, when the <HI>globular</HI> and
<PB N="119" REF="155">
grumous Part is in a far greater Proportion
than the <HI>Serum,</HI> more thick and vi&s;cid, having
a Glue or Size on its Top (of a bluei&s;h
at fir&s;t, and afterwards of a whiti&s;h or tal|low
Colour, increa&s;ing &s;ometimes to half or
more the Thickne&s;s of the Whole) the <HI>Serum</HI>
being in a &s;maller Quantity, and of a yel|lowi&s;h
or tawny Ca&s;t, &s;harp, acrid, and &s;alti&s;h
to the Ta&s;te. This &s;eems to be of a middling
Nature, (I &s;peak not here of that acci|dental
Size, generated by the Nitre of the
Air in catching Cold, which evani&s;hes in
a few Days by proper Management) between
the be&s;t and the wor&s;t, and is common to
<HI>Pleuri&s;ies, Rheumati&s;ms,</HI> &amp;c. 3<HI>dly,</HI> The
la&s;t State of the Blood, I &s;hall &s;peak of, is
where the <HI>fibrous</HI> or <HI>globular</HI> Part is &s;carce
any at all, and the <HI>Serum</HI> above ten or a
dozen times the Quantity of it, where the
globular Part &s;wims like an <HI>I&s;land</HI> amid&s;t the
Ocean, the <HI>Serum</HI> being &s;harp, &s;alti&s;h and
urinous, to the highe&s;t Degree in its Ta&s;te.
This I take to be the wor&s;t State, when the
Sharpne&s;s and <HI>Acrimony</HI> have arriv'd at their
utmo&s;t Height, like that of tho&s;e in a con|firm'd
<HI>Con&s;umption</HI> or <HI>Drop&s;y,</HI> and &s;ome
other mortal Di&s;tempers. But in all the&s;e
three <HI>States</HI> of the Blood, the <HI>Sharpne&s;s,
Heat,</HI> and <HI>Acrimony</HI> may ari&s;e almo&s;t to an
equal Degree, even to that of the wor&s;t
State, of which we have no Means of judg|ing,
but by the Ta&s;te, which is but gro&s;s
<PB N="120" REF="156">
and inaccurate, and therefore we mu&s;t be
contented with Probability. The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> of the&s;e
is commonly call'd <HI>good Blood,</HI> the <HI>&s;econd rich
Blood,</HI> and the third <HI>poor Blood.</HI> The <HI>Blood
Globules</HI> (con&s;i&s;ting probably of Parts of an
equal Degree of <HI>Attraction,</HI> and equal Den|&s;ity)
&s;eem to be form'd of the more &s;olid
Parts of the Food, by the Action of the
dige&s;tive Powers in the <HI>alimentary Tubes,</HI>
the Force of the Circulation, and the Grind|ing
of the Blood Ve&s;&s;els, and to receive their
<HI>globular</HI> Figure from the equal Pre&s;&s;ure, on
all Sides of the watery Fluid wherein they
&s;wim, and the equal Degree of Attraction in
their Parts. When the Quality and Quan|tity
of &s;uch Food is duely proportion'd, the
<HI>red Globules</HI> and <HI>Serum</HI> are pretty near of an
equal Quantity, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> being perfectly red
in the Air, and the <HI>&s;econd</HI> mo&s;tly limpid,
like that of the fir&s;t State. But when the
&s;olid Food is in too great a Proportion in the
whole Ma&s;s, either in Quantity or Quality,
a greater Proportion of <HI>Blood Globules</HI> will
nece&s;&s;arily be generated: And if the Solids
be &s;trong, &s;o as to comminute them &s;uffi|ciently,
and drive them about with a due
Force, they will produce an inflammatory
State of Blood, from whence <HI>acute Fevers,
Inflammations, Pleuri&s;ies,</HI> and the other hot
and inflammatory Ob&s;tructions and Di&s;ea&s;es
will ari&s;e. But if the &s;ame Proportion of
Food, both in Quantity and Quality, is
<PB N="121" REF="157">
thrown in, where the Solids are lax and
feeble, and con&s;equently, the <HI>Dige&s;tive Or|gans</HI>
weak, and the <HI>Circulation</HI> languid, the
Blood thence ari&s;ing will be vi&s;cid and &s;izy
in Proportion, and exhibit the Appearances
de&s;crib'd in the <HI>&s;econd</HI> State, from whence
Ob&s;tructions and Di&s;ea&s;es of the cold, <HI>chro|nical,</HI>
or <HI>nervous</HI> Kind will ari&s;e. On the
other hand, when the <HI>Drink</HI> is in too
great a Proportion to the &s;olid Food, when
great Quantities of &s;trong and &s;pirituous
Liquors are thrown into the Habit, and the
&s;mall Quantity of Food that is taken is
al&s;o &s;trong and full of <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> the
<HI>fibrous</HI> Part of the Blood will be produc'd in
a &s;maller Proportion to the <HI>&s;erous,</HI> or will be
con&s;um'd and burnt up by the greater Quan|tity
of <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Oils</HI> in the <HI>Serum</HI> proceeding
from &s;uch Nouri&s;hment, and &s;o the <HI>la&s;t</HI> State
of the Blood I have taken notice of will be
produc'd: whereby the Solids being &s;timu|lated
and corroded, and the Circulation car|ried
about with too great Hurry and Vio|lence,
or &s;ome great noble <HI>Bowel</HI> attack'd,
de&s;troy'd and &s;poil'd, various Di&s;ea&s;es of the
inflammatory-chronical kind will en&s;ue, as
<HI>Hectick Fevers, Con&s;umptions,</HI> &amp;c. the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els
being bur&s;t or corroded will occa&s;ion
<HI>Haemorrhages,</HI> or the Solids being weaken'd,
relax'd and broken, will &s;uffer this thin and
acrid Serum <HI>to ouze</HI> thro' their Sub&s;tances,
and thus beget a partial <HI>Drop&s;y,</HI> or a true
<PB N="122" REF="158">
<HI>A&s;cites.</HI> Something like the &s;ame State of
Blood may be occa&s;ion'd by a <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI>
or any great Lo&s;s of Blood, tho' tolerably
good, in what manner &s;oever it happens,
either by a Wound or otherwi&s;e: the re|maining
Part being robb'd of its <HI>red Globules,</HI>
or of too great a Quantity of the Compound
to be &s;oon repair'd, it will be unable to re|&s;i&s;t
the Force of the Solids, but will be re|duc'd
to a poor, thin, watery State, &s;o as, if
not pre&s;ently or &s;peedily re&s;tor'd to its for|mer
<HI>Bal&s;am</HI> and Texture, to end in a <HI>Drop&s;y,</HI>
in the Manner I have ju&s;t now de&s;crib'd,
e&s;pecially if a <HI>Mal-Regimen</HI> has proceeded or
&s;ucceeds it.</P>
<P>&sect;. VI. But to apply this more particularly
to the Di&s;ea&s;es I am now treating of: In all
<HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders produc'd by Exce&s;&s;es,
e&s;pecially after the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life, the
Blood is generally vi&s;cid and &s;izy, like that
of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> State, which I have de&s;crib'd.
I have not for the&s;e many Years let Blood
of any one (if it were but an Ounce or
two to make Ob&s;ervation on, of which I
have had innumerable In&s;tances) who being
&s;ubject to <HI>Nervous Di&s;tempers, Lowne&s;s, Va|pours,</HI>
or <HI>Melancholy,</HI> have not had it <HI>Sizy,
Rheumatick</HI> and <HI>Vi&s;cid,</HI> with a &s;harp yellow
<HI>Serum</HI> in &s;ome Degree or other. I have
always ob&s;erv'd the Blood of the younger
and tho&s;e under the <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life, in the&s;e
<PB N="123" REF="159">
who were violently &s;ubject to Nervous Di&s;|orders,
to be hot, fiery, inflam'd, acrid and
&s;harp, tho' the Colour and Con&s;i&s;tence might
be tolerably good, and then found it occa|&s;ion'd
by dealing too much in hot Liquors,
in Proportion to the original Weakne&s;s of
their Solids. But if the Vi&s;cidity of the
Juices was produc'd, as I have &s;aid, by an
Over-proportion of Food receiv'd into the
Habit, the Weakne&s;s of the Solids, and Slow|ne&s;s
of the Circulation being con&s;equent there|upon,
Ob&s;tructions mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be form'd
in the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els and <HI>Glands</HI> e&s;pecially of
the Liver, the Me&s;entery, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and then the
&s;tagnant Juices putrify, corrupt, turn acrid
and corro&s;ive (like what we &s;ee in &s;ome
other Ca&s;es of Ob&s;tructions that lie more
immediately under our Ob&s;ervation, parti|cularly
that produc'd by a Blow on the
Brea&s;t, which terminates in a <HI>Cancer</HI>); and the
urinous or <HI>animal Salts</HI> being let loo&s;e, tear,
corrode, and de&s;troy the Solids, from whence
the highe&s;t Degrees of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders
&s;pring: Indeed, in the la&s;t Stages of <HI>Nervous</HI>
Di&s;tempers, the Blood &s;ometimes approaches
to that which I have de&s;crib'd as the la&s;t
and wor&s;t State; but then the Ca&s;e is gone,
I think, beyond the Reach of human Means
or Art to remedy, &s;ince it generally attends
the entire Corruption of &s;ome of the great
<HI>Vi&s;cera;</HI> or the highe&s;t Degrees of &s;uch Ob|&s;tructions,
whereby the whole Ma&s;s of Blood
<PB N="124" REF="160">
is infected with the Poi&s;on, and the Juices
di&s;&s;olv'd and fus'd into a putrid Thinne&s;s,
like what is found in the la&s;t Stages of the
<HI>Black Jaundice,</HI> or &s;ome other mortal Di&s;|tempers.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Method and Medicines proper

<P>&sect;. I. IN order to attenuate the Juices, to

to de&s;troy their <HI>Vi&s;cidity</HI> and <HI>Glew|ine&s;s,</HI>
and to make them &s;ufficiently thin,
and fit to flow in the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els with

which either by their own Nature are

Force and <HI>Momentum;</HI> or la&s;tly, which by
Experience are found (without knowing a
Rea&s;on why) to be the mo&s;t effectual for
producing the&s;e Ends.</P>
<P><PB N="125" REF="161">
&sect;. II. I need not mention here the Nece&s;|&s;ity
before any Cour&s;e be enter'd upon for
this Purpo&s;e, of premi&s;ing the common and
proper univer&s;al Evacuations, as <HI>Bleeding,
Purging, Vomiting,</HI> &amp;c. &s;ome one or more
of which will always be found nece&s;&s;ary to
be fir&s;t of all perform'd, not only to le&s;&s;en
the Quantity of the corrupt Fluids in gene|ral,
but to clean&s;e the Alimentary Tubes,
that the proper Medicines may be more
ea&s;ily and readily convey'd into the Blood.
But as the&s;e Evacuations are never to be
undertaken without the Advice and A&s;&s;i&s;t|ance
of &s;ome skilful and hone&s;t <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI>
&s;o it is by his Direction that the <HI>Repetition
Do&s;e</HI> and Materials are to be adju&s;ted: For
the&s;e Evacuations are &s;o e&s;&s;ential in this
Ca&s;e in its fir&s;t Stage, that by going about
them indi&s;creetly, or neglecting to do them
as the Symptoms require, the Patient may
be ruin'd, by tru&s;ting to his own Judgment,
or relying upon general Rules, which in all
&s;evere, but particularly in <HI>Nervous</HI> Ca&s;es, are
both precarious and uncertain.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. AMONG the chief and principal of
&s;uch Medicines, are <HI>Mercury</HI> and its Prepara|tions,
<HI>Calomel, Mercury alcali&s;ated, precipitat</HI> per
&s;e, <HI>Quick&s;ilver, Silver-Water, Aethiops Mine|ral,
Cinnabar of Antimony, Antimony Diapho|retick,
Bezoar Mineral, Crude Antimony, Be|zoardicum
Joviale, Salt of Tin, Ens Veneris,</HI> and
<PB N="126" REF="162">
the like, who&s;e chief Efficacy &s;eems to lie in
their Weight, after they have dropt their
Salts in the Alimentary Tube. <HI>Next</HI> to
the&s;e are the Woods <HI>Guajacum, Sa&s;&s;afras, Sar|&s;aparilla,
Lignum Nephriticum,</HI> the &s;everal
Sorts of <HI>Saunders,</HI> Wood of <HI>Aloes,</HI> &amp;c. In
the <HI>third</HI> Order are the <HI>fix'd Salts,</HI> &s;uch as
<HI>Salt of Tartar, Salt of Wormwood, Broom,
Fern,</HI> &amp;c. The <HI>la&s;t</HI> Cla&s;s contains &s;uch
Vegetables, as are of an acrid and au&s;tere
Ta&s;te, &s;uch as are all the <HI>Ante&s;corbutick</HI>
Plants, of which there is Choice and Variety
in all the Modern Writers and Collectors of
the <HI>Materia Medica;</HI> &s;o that it is needle&s;s
here to detail them. The&s;e may be com|pounded
or combined in the be&s;t manner
po&s;&s;ible, to make them ea&s;y and agreeable
to the Stomach, by the Skill of the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI>
in ordinary: and if given in a proper Do&s;e,
and for a Time &s;ufficient, will &s;carce fail of
their Effect.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. IN the Admini&s;tration of <HI>Calomel,</HI>
for &s;uch a Purpo&s;e, it may be nece&s;&s;ary to
ob&s;erve, that however it may be manag'd
in Ca&s;es of another Nature, yet where it is
intended for the Cure of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es,
which &s;uppo&s;e weak Solids, and con&s;equently
tender Bowels, it will always be nece&s;&s;ary
to give it in the &s;malle&s;t Do&s;e, as an <HI>Alte|rative</HI>
only, and not an Evacuant; for <HI>Ex|ample,</HI>
In two, three, or four Grains, once,
<PB N="127" REF="163">
twice, or three times a day, becau&s;e thus it
may be given with Safety for a much longer
Time, and will not be thrown off by the
greater Conduits of Evacuation, nor meerly
circulate thro' the greater Blood-Ve&s;&s;els,
but gently and gradually in&s;inuate it&s;elf into
the &s;malle&s;t <HI>Capillary</HI> ones, where its Virtue
and Efficacy is mo&s;t wanted, and where it
can do the mo&s;t Service. For this Rea&s;on it is
chiefly, that in many deep <HI>Venereal</HI> Ca&s;es,
<HI>Salivation</HI> by the internal Exhibition of
Mercurials only, &s;eldom &s;ucceeds: whereas
by <HI>Inunction</HI> it &s;eldom fails; <HI>viz.</HI> that when
it happens to be perform'd on People of weak
Nerves, and tender Con&s;titutions, and patent
Glands, it is generally thrown off by the
greater Out-lets, with great Danger to the
Patient; &s;o that a few Grains commonly rai&s;e
a Scorbutick <HI>Ptyali&s;m,</HI> which few can di|&s;tingui&s;h
from a Mercurial Salivation, and &s;o
they are &s;carce able to go on: or at be&s;t, it
circulates only thro' the Trunk of the greater
Arteries and Veins, to be thrown off by the
more patent and larger <HI>Glands,</HI> and &s;eldom
or never gets Admittance into the Capillary
Ve&s;&s;els: whereas by <HI>Inunction,</HI> or in &s;mall
and often repeated Do&s;es, it is receiv'd into
the&s;e la&s;t immediately or gradually, and
there does its Work. In <HI>Nervous</HI> Ca&s;es the
&s;ame Effect is obtain'd by the longer Time,
and le&s;&s;er Do&s;es, the&s;e Con&s;titutions neither
admitting nor requiring &s;o violent and quick
<PB N="128" REF="164">
a Deob&s;truent. But even this Method, in
its gentle&s;t Degree will fit none but the
<HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders, of the &s;tronger and
robu&s;ter Con&s;titutions, which having been
originally &s;ound, have contracted the&s;e Di&s;|orders
by a <HI>Mal-Regimen.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. V. THE Medicines next to this the mo&s;t
effectual for the fir&s;t Intention, are <HI>Aethiops
Mineral,</HI> the <HI>Aethiops Antimoniatum, Cinna|bar,</HI>
but e&s;pecially <HI>Mercurius Alcali&s;atus,</HI> or
the other Preparations of Quick&s;ilver, with
the various Preparations of <HI>Antimony,</HI> of which
there is great Variety (and might be more).
And this <HI>Aethiops Mineral</HI> is indeed an excel|lent
Remedy, both from the Weight of the
<HI>Mercury,</HI> and the clean&s;ing Nature of the
<HI>Sulphur</HI> entring its Compo&s;ition, and would
do the whole in Time nece&s;&s;ary for this
Intention, were it not that even few, but
tho&s;e of the &s;tronger Sort, can bear the
Slipperine&s;s, and violent Cholicks and
Gripes, which it brings on their Bowels:
which not only &s;inks them more, but occa|&s;ions
the Medicine to be carry'd off before
it enters the Habit; and therefore when it
is us'd in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, I &s;hould always ad|vi&s;e
an A&s;tringent or warm Medicine, &s;uch
as <HI>Dia&s;cordium, Mithridate, Venice Treacle,</HI>
and the like, to be join'd with it: perhaps
a le&s;s Quantity of <HI>Sulphur</HI> in the Preparation
would mend it, and make it go further than
<PB N="129" REF="165">
the Alimentary Tube. But tho&s;e who are
&s;trong, and who&s;e Bowels are firm, bear
it ea&s;ily; and in &s;ome I join <HI>Gum Guajac</HI> to
it, with <HI>Salt of Wormwood,</HI> to make it more
clean&s;ing, attenuating and deob&s;truent, with
great Succe&s;s. <HI>Bello&s;t</HI>'s Quick&s;ilver Pills are
of the &s;ame Nature and Virtue for this fir&s;t
<HI>Intention,</HI> as well as for <HI>A&s;thmatick</HI> Ca&s;es, and,
I think, the Be&s;t way of taking <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI>
inwardly.</P>
<P>&sect;. VI. THAT which I generally prefer in
vi&s;cid Juices, in Per&s;ons &s;ubject to Nervous
Di&s;orders, in very low Ca&s;es, is <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of
<HI>Antimony,</HI> both becau&s;e it creates fewer Tu|mults
in the Stomach and Bowels, pa&s;&s;es more
readily into the Blood, and &s;eldom keeps the
Bowels &s;lippery, unle&s;s it be in exceeding low
Ca&s;es. Tho&s;e who are robu&s;t, or &s;till in a great
mea&s;ure &s;trong, may bear the <HI>Aethiops;</HI> but
both the very Young and very Weak, if their
Juices be either too vi&s;cid or too &s;harp, will
find the greate&s;t Relief from this Medicine,
duly fitted to their Con&s;titution, and conti|nued
for a long Time, if any of the whole
Tribe of the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> (in my Judg|ment)
can po&s;&s;ibly do it. Its Efficacy in
Childrens <HI>Epileptick</HI> and <HI>Convul&s;ive</HI> Fits, and
indeed in all their <HI>Chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers, is
&s;ufficiently known and acknowledg'd. And
I have found the &s;ame Effects in many Ca&s;es
both <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Chronical,</HI> even in adult
Per&s;ons, both to my Surprize and Admira|tion.
<PB N="130" REF="166">
If it has fail'd, it is becau&s;e it has not
been long enough continu'd. A <HI>Patient</HI> of
mine, now alive, has us'd it the&s;e twenty
years. It fir&s;t (by my Advice) cured him of
his <HI>Nervous</HI> Complaints; and whenever he
ails, he has recour&s;e to it on occa&s;ions to this
Day. It ought to be given fre&s;h, or the lea&s;t
&s;tale po&s;&s;ible, otherwi&s;e it may become tur|bulent
in the Bowels; and it ought to be as
finely levigated as Art can make it, to enter
more readily into the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els. And in|deed,
when I con&s;ider that mo&s;t other <HI>Mer|curial</HI>
Medicines, tho' they are the mo&s;t
powerful Attenuants of the Juices, yet (as all
ponderous and very active Medicines mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily do) they, with the Salts united,
&s;crape thin and relax the Solids. I think this
the &s;afe&s;t and mo&s;t effectual of all the Atte|nuants,
in very low Ca&s;es, e&s;pecially if a little
of the <HI>Re&s;in</HI> or <HI>Extract</HI> of the Je&s;uits Bark
be added to it, to keep up the Force of
the Solids, at the &s;ame time that it is di&s;&s;ol|ving
the Vi&s;cidity of the Juices, and opening
the Ob&s;tructions in the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els: for it
is impo&s;&s;ible to get any <HI>Mercurial</HI> Medicine
that has not &s;ome Tendency to weaken them.</P>
<P>&sect;. VII. THERE is nothing I could more
earne&s;tly wi&s;h were brought into the com|mon

and general (but cautious) U&s;e of the Prepa|rations

<PB N="131" REF="167">
join'd to a thin, cool, &s;oft and mild Diet, to
an&s;wer this <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Intention of a total Cure. Dr.
<HI>Charlton,</HI> who had the licen&s;ing of the <HI>Quacks</HI>
in King <HI>Charles</HI> II. Time, told on his Death-Bed
(as I am well inform'd) that all the u&s;e|ful
or &s;ucce&s;sful Cures perform'd by the
<HI>Mountebanks</HI> of his Time, were owing to the
Preparations of <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Antimony</HI> only;
and it is a great Pity, that &s;uch glorious Re|medies
&s;hould be in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion chiefly (I
mean the Preparations of <HI>Mercury</HI>) of &s;uch
unskilful, unprincipled Wretches. For a re|gular
reputable Phy&s;ician may endanger his
Reputation among the weak and prejudiced,
who deals freely in it, tho' it be a Remedy
only fit to bear the Name. <HI>Mercury</HI> is the
only Fluid in Nature (except Water) fit to
circulate thro' hollow Animal Tubes; (Two
of the others, Light and Aether, can &s;carce
be retain'd in them) its greater Weight than
any other Kinds of Matter (except <HI>Gold</HI>) makes
it the mo&s;t capable to force its way: But then
<HI>Gold</HI> and all other Minerals having no innate
<HI>Fluidity,</HI> nor Natural Rotundity of Particles,
mu&s;t be always carry'd on Water to be intro|duc'd
into an Animal Habit, with which they
never kindly mix. <HI>Mercury,</HI> in all its Divi|&s;ions,
Mixtures and Unions with other Bodies,
is &s;till reduceable to Liquid <HI>Quick&s;ilver:</HI> which
makes it not improbable, that when it has
dropp'd its Mixtures in Animal Ve&s;&s;els, in the
<HI>Alimentary Duct</HI> e&s;pecially, it returns to its
primitive <HI>Fluidity,</HI> and acts with the united
<PB N="132" REF="168">
Force of the whole then collected Ma&s;s of
Particles; and we know what Efficacy Shot
and &s;mall Bullets of Lead have in cleaning
foul Bottles or &s;mall Tubes.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Boerhaave</HI>'s Chymi&s;try.</NOTE> The Rotundity
of its Particles (in all its vi&s;ible and &s;en&s;ible
Divi&s;ions, and even in its A&s;cent in the <HI>Retort,</HI>
and in all its other Preparations, apparent by
fine Gla&s;&s;es) with its <HI>Fluidity,</HI> makes them
probably &s;mooth, and &s;o without any Injury
to the <HI>Capillaries,</HI> except from their Weight
only. The infinite Smallne&s;s of its Particles,
evident by its ready A&s;cent in a Retort from
the lea&s;t even a Sand-Heat only, and its
almo&s;t infinite Force of <HI>Attraction</HI> (from
the&s;e general Principles of its Weight and
Quantity of Matter, and from many Expe|riments)
makes it always run into a fluid
Ma&s;s, when its <HI>&s;pherical</HI> Particles are brought
near enough: whereby its Force is greatly
increas'd. From all which Con&s;iderations
(obvious even to common Sen&s;e, without
<HI>fine&s;&s;ing</HI>) it is evident what a <HI>Noble Medi|cine</HI>
it might be made in <HI>Chronical</HI> Ca&s;es of
all Kinds, vi&s;cid Juices and Ob&s;tructions of
the Organs, if duly prepar'd, do&s;ed and fitted
to the Patient and the Di&s;temper. The <HI>Mer|curius
Alcali&s;atus</HI> (of <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> and <HI>Crabs-Eyes
prepar'd,</HI> and rubb'd together till the
fir&s;t di&s;appear) is an admirable <HI>Medicin,</HI> and
in a &s;mall Do&s;e gives no Trouble or Unea&s;i|ne&s;s,
<PB N="133" REF="169">
and is &s;pecifick in <HI>Cutaneous Foulne&s;&s;es,</HI>
and almo&s;t all other Chronical Ca&s;es, e&s;peci|ally
<HI>Nervous,</HI> to this Fir&s;t Intention, as well
as is the <HI>Precipitate per &s;e:</HI> I have often us'd
them both with great Succe&s;s, even in <HI>Ner|vous</HI>
Ca&s;es, &s;ince they have been &s;o univer|&s;ally
known. Liquid <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> will do great
Service in beginning <HI>Plicatures</HI> of the Inte|&s;tines,
Ob&s;tructions of their Glands and Valves,
and in Foulne&s;&s;es and hard Concretions or
Ob&s;tructions, bred in the Mouths of the
<HI>Lacteals</HI> (which are often Ca&s;es where the
Symptoms common to other Di&s;ea&s;es, will not
admit a certain Di&s;tinction) but eminently &s;o
in <HI>A&s;thmatic</HI> Ca&s;es, above all other Medicines.
By its Weight only, forcing open the ob&s;truc|tive
Mouths of the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> and its Steams
thereby entring the Habit, attenuate the vi&s;|cid
Juices of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and render them
pervious, and &s;o promotes <HI>Expectoration;</HI> and,
I think, other more appropriated and &s;pecifick
Medicines not &s;ucceeding, this ought to be
try'd in all Ca&s;es of the <HI>Alimentary Tube,</HI> &s;ince
it is as innocent and &s;afe as A&s;&s;es Milk. And
even the <HI>Aq. Mercurialis</HI> or Silver Water, as
it &s;ucceeds beyond any thing in Childrens
Worm Ca&s;es: &s;o I am &s;atisfy'd, were it try'd in
other Ca&s;es, might do Wonders: e&s;pecially in
<HI>Decoctions of the Woods, Anti&s;corbutick</HI> Waters,
or other appropriated Liquors; for as it nei|ther
alters Ta&s;te, Smell, nor any other &s;en&s;i|ble
Quality of the Liquid, it may be &s;afely
us'd as long, and in as great Quantities as one
<PB N="134" REF="170">
plea&s;es, without any Trouble, Pain, or Danger.
I am therefore of the Opinion, that the mo&s;t
effectual Remedies in Nature in Chronical
Ca&s;es and their fir&s;t Stages, is the Prepara|tions
of <HI>Mercury,</HI> of one Kind or other, toge|ther
with <HI>Diet.</HI> Where it has not &s;ucceeded,
it is chiefly becau&s;e proper <HI>Diet</HI> has not
been join'd; and, I believe, there are few
Ca&s;es and Con&s;titutions, where &s;ome of the&s;e
mention'd Preparations may not agree in
proper Do&s;es; and, if duly continu'd, are
not of wonderful Benefit, where the <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI>
are not quite &s;poil'd. But the Management
mu&s;t be in the Hands of a &s;ober, careful and
experienc'd <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> who well under&s;tands
and con&s;iders what Nature will bear, and
what not; for it is not an indifferent or tri|fling
Medicine, but a <HI>Divine Antidote,</HI> or a
certain <HI>Poi&s;on,</HI> according to the <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> in which,
and the <HI>Per&s;on</HI> by whom, it is pre&s;crib'd; and
I &s;carce willingly ever advi&s;e it at a Di&s;tance
in any Preparation, for it ought always to be
watch'd. Where the Ve&s;&s;els are very lax,
putrify'd, or thin: or the Ob&s;truction very
hard or <HI>&s;chirrous,</HI> the more active Prepara|tions
mu&s;t be cautiou&s;ly avoided, and nothing
but the gentle&s;t Preparations try'd, <HI>viz.</HI> the
<HI>Aethiops,</HI> the <HI>Cinnabars,</HI> the <HI>Mercurius Alca|li&s;atus,</HI>
the <HI>Precipitat per &s;e, Aq. Argentea,</HI>
and the like. For as to the Opinion of &s;ome,
<HI>viz.</HI> that the&s;e mention'd Preparations get no
further than the Alimentary <HI>Duct,</HI> I think it
without all Foundation, either from Philo&s;o|phy
<PB N="135" REF="171">
or Experience: when we &s;ee the <HI>Aethiops</HI>
and the <HI>Cinnabars,</HI> Liquid <HI>Quick&s;ilver</HI> and
the <HI>Silver Water,</HI> cure Cutaneous Di&s;tem|pers,
Inflammations of the Eyes, <HI>St. Anthony's
Fire,</HI> the <HI>Itch,</HI> the <HI>Piles,</HI> and the like; and
when they will &s;oil the Silver and Gold about
the Patient. Nay, as I am &s;atisfy'd all the
Kinds of them will at la&s;t rai&s;e a kind of a
<HI>Ptyali&s;m.</HI> But even tho' then its principal
Action were only on the <HI>Glands</HI> of the Sto|mach
and Inte&s;tines, yet the opening the&s;e,
and enabling them to perform their <HI>Functions,</HI>
may be &s;ufficient, by <HI>Derivation</HI> to propagate
a proportional Benefit over the whole Habit.
<HI>La&s;tly,</HI> when we &s;ee Mercury boil'd in Water
only, without lo&s;ing the lea&s;t e&s;timable Weight,
have &s;uch &s;en&s;ible Effects, as in Time to do all
that any other Preparation can, as I am con|vinced
it will: we can ea&s;ily conceive how any
Preparation of it, impregnating the Chyle
with its infinite &s;mall Particles, may enter the
<HI>Lacteals</HI> and pervade the whole Habit, and
when long continu'd, may have wonderful
Efficacy on the mo&s;t di&s;tant Parts of the
Body; for the even actually almo&s;t infi|nite
Smallne&s;s of its Parts, the <HI>Sphericity</HI> of
its Particles, and its exceeding great <HI>Weight,</HI>
will make it in any <HI>Shape</HI> pa&s;s readily thro'
any Animal Sub&s;tance in Time. The Pre|parations
of Antimony may po&s;&s;ibly be of
great Virtue, if &s;ufficiently try'd and examin'd;
but I having us'd none but the common Shop
ones, finding the Preparations of <HI>Mercury</HI> &s;uf|ficient,
<PB N="136" REF="172">
can &s;ay nothing of them. The Pre|parations
of <HI>Mercury,</HI> &s;ome one or other,
&s;eem much more proper for this Intention.</P>
<P>&sect;. VIII. I SHALL &s;ay nothing of the other
<HI>Attenuants,</HI> e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Vegetable
Kind, who&s;e Virtues may be ea&s;ily learn'd from
the Books of the <HI>Materia Medica</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Phytoba&s;anos of Sir</HI> John Floyer.</NOTE>. As for
tho&s;e of the Mineral Kind, of which I have
&s;aid nothing in particular, I leave them to the
Judgment of tho&s;e Phy&s;icians, who have had
more Experience of them; my Practice and
Ob&s;ervation having confin'd me pretty much
to tho&s;e I have remark'd on, finding them the
mo&s;t ready, &s;ufficient, and, by their Nature,
fitte&s;t. I &s;hall only add a Word or two con|cerning
the <HI>Wild Valerian</HI> (&s;o much com|mended
by <HI>Fabius Columna</HI>) in all <HI>Nervous</HI>
Ca&s;es, but e&s;pecially the wor&s;t and highe&s;t
Degrees of them. It is certainly one of the
mo&s;t <HI>active</HI> and <HI>volatile</HI> of the Vegetable
Kingdom, and &s;eems to act chiefly by pro|moting
the Per&s;piration, and a gentle <HI>Dia|phore&s;is.</HI>
The Root powder'd and given with
<HI>Cinnabar of Antimony</HI> and Powder of <HI>Black
Hellebor,</HI> has frequently good Succe&s;s; and a
Tea made of its Leaves, is an admirable Di|luter,
and may be long continu'd with Ad|vantage
in the&s;e Ca&s;es. I will &s;ay nothing
here of the <HI>Mi&s;letoe,</HI> it belonging (in my
<PB N="137" REF="173">
Opinion) to another Cla&s;s of Medicines (to

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Medicines proper for the Second
Intention.</HEAD>
<P>&sect;. I. WHEN the former <HI>Intention</HI> has
been &s;ufficiently and &s;ucce&s;sfully
pur&s;u'd, &s;o that the Blood is re|turn'd
to its due Degree of Thinne&s;s, Fluidity
and <HI>Bal&s;am;</HI> when the Acutene&s;s of the Pains,
and the Violence of the Symptoms are le&s;&s;en'd
by the ponderous Remedies, and the <HI>Fits</HI> or
<HI>Paroxy&s;ms</HI> are le&s;s &s;evere or frequent: then the
Medicines of <HI>this</HI> Cla&s;s may be united and com|pounded
with tho&s;e of the <HI>former,</HI> to &s;heath
and blunt the <HI>Acrimony</HI> of the Salts, and the
Sharpne&s;s of the Juices, di&s;charg'd from the
&s;mall Ve&s;&s;els: to &s;cour and clean&s;e the internal
Sides of the&s;e Ve&s;&s;els yet further: and drive
the ponderous Medicines into the mo&s;t remote
<HI>Capillaries,</HI> where the Di&s;order fir&s;t begins,
and is mo&s;t rooted: there to open a Pa&s;&s;age
<PB N="138" REF="174">
for the Circulation and Per&s;piration, and re|move
any Ob&s;tructions, putrid or &s;tagnant
Juices, and &s;o to bring all the Secretions to a
regular Order, and the whole Ma&s;s of the
Fluids to a due Degree of Sweetne&s;s and <HI>Bal|&s;am.</HI>
This Method and Order mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily
be follow'd, where a total and ab&s;olute Cure is
intended or expected: But where a <HI>Palliative</HI>
Cure only is de&s;ign'd, the&s;e may be blended
with the former, even from the beginning of
the Cure. And where the Blood is in that
Condition, which I have mention'd as the
la&s;t and wor&s;t State: they may even take the
Place of the former and go before them, if
there be any rea&s;onable Hopes of Succe&s;s;
becau&s;e the great Degree of Acrimony dif|fus'd
thro' the whole Ma&s;s of Blood, requires
a more immediate Attention and Application,
than the removing of Ob&s;tructions; (which
is often the Ca&s;e in many <HI>Scorbutick, Hectick,
Icterical, Scrophulous</HI> and <HI>Cancerous</HI> Habits:)
at lea&s;t the Medicines for the Second Inten|tion,
are the ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary: and the only
Means that can effectuate a <HI>Palliative</HI> Cure,
and relieve the Symptoms then.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. WATER is acknowledg'd to be the
mo&s;t univer&s;al <HI>Di&s;&s;olver</HI> of Salts of all Kinds,
and would certainly di&s;&s;olve the&s;e mention'd
<HI>Concretions</HI> in the greater Ve&s;&s;els, and help to
carry them out of the Habit; but it not
having Activity or Agility enough to get into
<PB N="139" REF="175">
the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els, where the Danger is greate&s;t,
and the Want mo&s;t, it cannot alone be &s;uffi|cient
here. Tho&s;e Medicines therefore that
are of the mo&s;t <HI>active</HI> and <HI>volatile</HI> Kind,
which have, as it were, a <HI>penetrating</HI> Steam
or Vapour flowing out of them, like that of
Fire or Light: which can mo&s;t readily per|vade
the Solids, and get into the inmo&s;t Re|ce&s;&s;es
of the Habit, &s;eem to be the mo&s;t effe|ctual
for this Purpo&s;e; e&s;pecially if a &s;oft
Bal&s;am be added to the&s;e Qualities, which
may both &s;heath the Salts in the great Ve&s;&s;els,
as it goes along to the &s;mall ones, or &s;o guard
again&s;t their Irritation and Acrimony, as to
hinder their otherwi&s;e de&s;tructive Effects.
Of this Kind all the <HI>foetid</HI> and <HI>volatile</HI> Sub|&s;tances
&s;eem to be the chief: or tho&s;e which
emit the &s;tronge&s;t <HI>Effluvia,</HI> or in the greate&s;t
Quantity, &s;uch are particularly the <HI>volatile
Gums</HI> and Juices, the volatile <HI>Salts</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI>
which are nothing but &s;olid or liquid Natural
<HI>Pho&s;phori,</HI> or Fire Sub&s;tances. To the&s;e may
be join'd the Soaps, and <HI>Saponaceous</HI> Sub|&s;tances.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. THE principal Medicines of this
<HI>Tribe</HI> are, <HI>Gum Ammoniacum, Galbanum, A&s;&s;a
foetida, Sagapenum, Myrrh, Guajacum, Cam|phire,
Ca&s;tor, Amber, Salt of Hart&s;horn, Salt
of Amber, Salt</HI> and <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Human Skulls,</HI>
and of <HI>Raw Silk, Ca&s;tile Soap, Saffron, Gar|lick,
Hor&s;e-Radi&s;h,</HI> and the like, of which
<PB N="140" REF="176">
there is &s;ufficient Variety; but the&s;e &s;eem to
be the mo&s;t powerful.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. AMONG the&s;e I &s;hould prefer the
<HI>Ammoniacum, Galbanum, Sagapenum,</HI> but e&s;pe|cially
the <HI>A&s;&s;a faetida,</HI> &s;ince we are at the la&s;t
come to judge of and ea&s;ily find out the true,
from, and in the Adulterated, by its cutting
white, and turning afterwards of a Pink-Blo&s;&s;om
Colour, according to the De&s;cription
of it by the <HI>Antients</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide <HI>Plinii Hi&s;t. Nat.</HI> Lib. XIX. Cap. 3.</NOTE>, by whom its Virtues
are celebrated with Prai&s;es, even above the
Merit of any natural Remedy. It certainly
de&s;erves (as a pre&s;ent Relief in extreme Ca&s;es)
as much as any one Thing in the <HI>Materia
Medica</HI> in &s;uch Ca&s;es, it having all the kindly
Effects of quieting <HI>Anxiety</HI> and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI>
procuring Re&s;t, and all the other Benefits of
<HI>Opium,</HI> without leaving that Lowne&s;s and
Depre&s;&s;ion behind it, which this la&s;t, when
its Force is wrought off, does in mo&s;t Per&s;ons,
like Brandy or Inflammatory Spirits: in&s;omuch,
that in a great many Ca&s;es and Con&s;titutions
it is a great Que&s;tion, whether the pre&s;ent
Relief be &s;ufficient to balance the &s;ub&s;equent
<HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Anxiety:</HI> for which there is
no other Remedy, but repeating one Do&s;e as
another wears off, as the <HI>Turks</HI> do, or as
Drunkards do with their Drams, till both
<PB N="141" REF="177">
come to be without Mea&s;ure or End, and
have made the Di&s;ea&s;e perhaps irremediable
by any Means, but the Death which it cer|tainly
brings on. But this natural <HI>Pho&s;phorus</HI>
having Light and Activity without Fire or
Heat, ea&s;ily pervades the whole Habit, and
penetrates the &s;malle&s;t Ve&s;&s;els, and makes the
Per&s;piration flow readily, as<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Medicina Statica,</HI> Sect. 3. Aph. 82.</NOTE> <HI>Sanctorius</HI> ob|&s;erves,
and thus gives a Relief for &s;ome con|&s;iderable
Time; and when other proper Me|thods
are join'd with it, will help forward a
la&s;ting Cure. The <HI>Soots</HI> of &s;ome or any Woods
are, or &s;eem to me to be, of the &s;ame Nature
and Efficacy, and are, I think, <HI>Pho&s;phorus</HI>'s,
(where the remaining Fire is actually, but lies
hid under the A&s;hes) which by their Activity
and <HI>Volatility</HI> getting into the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els,
the Joints and Mu&s;cular Sub&s;tances, di&s;&s;olves
and melts the Jelly and Size, (as actual Fire
does Hart&s;horn Jelly and Glew) and thereby
enables them to circulate for &s;ome Time, and
&s;o become at be&s;t but Reliefs and Reprieves,
but no Cures; for accordingly, if not con|&s;tantly
repeated, the Complaints return, as
a Man of a chilly Con&s;titution, mu&s;t be
always hovering over the Fire.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. I SHOULD &s;ay &s;omething of <HI>Ammo|niacum,</HI>
but that its Virtues are &s;ufficiently
<PB N="142" REF="178">
known in <HI>A&s;thmatick</HI> and <HI>Pulmonick</HI> Ca&s;es,
(where it is the &s;overeign Remedy, and mo&s;t
effectually attenuates vi&s;cid Phlegm) to make
its Efficacy believ'd in the Ca&s;es of vi&s;cid
Juices I am &s;peaking of. <HI>Sagapenum</HI> likewi&s;e
and <HI>Galbanum</HI> are very effectual for the &s;ame
Purpo&s;e. Nor ought the Product of our own
Country, <HI>Garlick</HI> and <HI>Hor&s;e-Radi&s;h,</HI> to be
neglected, the fir&s;t of which is as effectual in
<HI>Lung</HI> Ca&s;es, as the mention'd <HI>Ammoniacum.</HI>
The only Inconvenience of the&s;e <HI>foetid</HI> Medi|cines
is the di&s;agreeable Ta&s;te and Scent they
leave, which is &s;o offen&s;ive to delicate Per|&s;ons;
but that may be, in a great mea&s;ure,
overcome by proper Mixtures, or mu&s;t be
born with in extreme Ca&s;es. Under this <HI>Cla&s;s,</HI>
and chiefly to an&s;wer this <HI>Intention,</HI> the <HI>Aci|dulae</HI>
or <HI>Mineral Waters</HI> ought to be rank'd,
but mo&s;t eminently the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, becau&s;e
of their <HI>Sulphur</HI> as well as <HI>Steel;</HI> and it is
becau&s;e the ponderous and active Remedies
have not been &s;ufficiently ply'd before, in
habitual and ob&s;tinate <HI>Nervous</HI> Ca&s;es, that
<HI>Bath Waters</HI> have not always the&s;e &s;en&s;ible
and la&s;ting Effects, as they mo&s;t infallibly
would have, if duly cla&s;s'd and manag'd; and
in all &s;uch <HI>Cachectical</HI> and <HI>Nervous</HI> Ca&s;es,
<HI>Mineral</HI> Waters, <HI>the&s;e</HI> e&s;pecially, are the be&s;t

advancing gradually without Fear or Danger
of Relap&s;e, unle&s;s the Patient return to tho&s;e

This Plea&s;ure I have enjoy'd my&s;elf once and

<P>&sect;. II. THE Medicines which an&s;wer this
Intention, will be tho&s;e of the Strength|ning
and A&s;tringent Kind, which <HI>contract,
corrugate,</HI> wind up and give Firmne&s;s and
Force to the weak and relaxed Solids, Fibres
and Nerves. Of this <HI>Tribe</HI> are all the <HI>Bitters,
Aromaticks</HI> and <HI>Chalybeats:</HI> &s;uch as the
<HI>Je&s;uit's Bark, Steel, Gentian, Zedoary, Ca&s;|&s;amunair,
Calamus aromaticus, Snakeweed,
Contrayerva, Cinamon, Winter's Bark, Cha|momile
Flowers, Wormwood</HI> and <HI>Centaury-Tops,
Terra Japanica,</HI> &amp;c. Here likewi&s;e the <HI>Oak
Bark,</HI> and its Offspring the <HI>Mi&s;letoe</HI> and
<HI>Acorns,</HI> &s;eem to have their proper Place, and
every thing that is &s;ubacid, whether Mineral
or Vegetable.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. I THINK there is not a more won|derful
Strengthner of the Solids in all the
Compa&s;s of Medicine, than the <HI>Je&s;uits Bark.</HI>
The fir&s;t time I us'd it my&s;elf as a Strengthner
and bitter A&s;tringent (after having diluted and
thinn'd my Juices &s;ufficiently by Medicine and
<PB N="145" REF="181">
Diet) I can &s;ay it with Truth, never any thing
in Nature (Medicinal) affected me in &s;o &s;en|&s;ible
and &s;urprizing a Manner, or gave me &s;o
quick an Appetite, &s;uch Activity, and &s;o &s;erene
clear Spirits, as the <HI>Bark</HI> did, after taking it
for &s;ome Time. It is true, the&s;e Effects did
not la&s;t in their greate&s;t Heighth always, but
they were &s;till con&s;iderable for a long Time:
and I went on gaining Ground by it in that
<HI>Period</HI> (for I continu'd it near a Year) till I
had a perfect Recovery. I have &s;een pretty
near the &s;ame Effects from it in others, and
in the like <HI>Nervous</HI> Ca&s;es: tho' it had not the
&s;ame Degree of good Succe&s;s in my next Re|lap&s;e,
as was not to be expected in a further
advanc'd Age; but &s;till it had better than any
other, and I take it univer&s;ally to be the be&s;t
and only cool bitter A&s;tringent known to
Men. I have known People labouring under
an internal <HI>Gouti&s;h</HI> Humour (even tho&s;e be|longing
to the <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion of Phy&s;ick</HI>) who have
affirm'd to me, that they were never vapour'd
or low-&s;pirited to any Degree, while they con|tinu'd
the U&s;e of the <HI>Bark</HI> under the <HI>Gout,</HI> which
they had interrupted only, becau&s;e they had been
a&s;&s;ur'd, that it confin'd and ty'd up the <HI>Gouty</HI>
Humour from being thrown outward: than
which there is nothing more &s;al&s;e and ab&s;urd;
for nothing &s;o much promotes the <HI>Gouty</HI>
Humour towards the Extremities, becau&s;e it
&s;trengthens the Solids: And I have frequently
<PB N="146" REF="182">
given a Fit of the <HI>Gout</HI> with it and <HI>Steel,</HI>
when nothing el&s;e would effect it; and I
always found it the mo&s;t effectual of all Me|dicines,
to recover Appetite, Strength and
Spirits, after a &s;evere Fit was over, as is
now univer&s;ally experienc'd and acknow|ledg'd.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. NEXT to the <HI>Bark</HI> (or even be|yond
it) is <HI>Steel,</HI> or <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Medicines and
<HI>Mineral Chalybeat</HI> Waters, which act prin|cipally
by con&s;tricting, cri&s;ping, and wind|ing
up the relax'd Solids. Weak and young
Per&s;ons, and &s;light Ca&s;es, do well with liquid
Steel, &s;uch as the <HI>Vinum Chalybeatum, Tinc|tura
Martis,</HI> the Solution of <HI>Sal Martis</HI> in
common Water, <HI>Elixir Vitrioli,</HI> and the like.
But tho&s;e who are &s;tronger and older, re|quire
<HI>Steel Ru&s;t,</HI> join'd with Aromaticks and
Bitters, and the <HI>Bark;</HI> for they are all
of one <HI>Tribe</HI> and <HI>Cla&s;s</HI> of Medicines, and
differ only in Degree: in which the Prepa|rations
of <HI>Iron</HI> is the &s;tronge&s;t, as is evident
from its <HI>Energy</HI> in Externally &s;topping Haemor|rhages,
and corrugating tender Fibres, and its
partaking the Nature of Vitriol and Acids.
Where the&s;e do not relieve at lea&s;t, the Ca&s;e
mu&s;t be very bad, or the Medicines apply'd
much out of Time, while the Juices were
too vi&s;cid, or not &s;ufficiently thin and &s;weet.
<HI>Sydenham</HI> &s;eem'd to doubt, whether Purga|tives
<PB N="147" REF="183">
ought to be join'd with <HI>Chalybeats</HI> in
the &s;ame Cour&s;e; but that can be no Diffi|culty
to tho&s;e who have under&s;tood what has
been before &s;aid, or are well acquainted with
true Philo&s;ophy and the Animal <HI>OEconomy.</HI>
For the Purgatives are either &s;imply de&s;ign'd
(in &s;uch a Ca&s;e) to clean&s;e the <HI>Primae Viae,</HI>
or to <HI>fu&s;e</HI> and thin the Blood: in the fir&s;t
Ca&s;e they are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and in the
&s;econd more &s;o, if the <HI>fir&s;t Intention</HI> has not been
fully pur&s;u'd before: As we find by <HI>Lower</HI>'s
bitter Tincture, e&s;pecially when a Purgative
and Chalybeat with the <HI>Bark</HI> is combin'd, which
&s;ucceeds wonderfully in &s;uch Ca&s;es, where
the Habit is pretty full, and the Solids not
much relax'd. But a long Cour&s;e of <HI>Cha|lybcat</HI>
Mineral Waters is &s;till the mo&s;t effe|ctual
for the Purpo&s;e: <HI>Spaw, Pyrmont,</HI> or
<HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in the hot Weather; and <HI>Bath</HI> in
the temperate and cold Weather. Some fearful
and apprehen&s;ive People have been di&s;&s;uaded,
by intere&s;ted Per&s;ons, from the U&s;e of the
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters in <HI>Lowne&s;s, Oppre&s;&s;ion,</HI> and <HI>Va|pours;</HI>
and &s;ome unexperienced People have
even imagin'd they have had more Vapours
than ordinary under the U&s;e of them. But the&s;e
may as well affirm, that <HI>Opium</HI> purges, and
<HI>Jallap</HI> binds. For if they mend the Faults
and Weakne&s;&s;es of the Stomach and Bowels,
(as all the World acknowledges they do, and
mu&s;t do by their Nature and Compo&s;ition)
they mu&s;t then infallibly be mo&s;t beneficial
<PB N="148" REF="184">
in the&s;e Di&s;orders, as from my own, and the
Experience of many thou&s;and others, can be
te&s;tified, who will affirm them to be the mo&s;t
certain Relief of any in &s;uch Ca&s;es. And
indeed, as by their <HI>Sulphur</HI> thus di&s;&s;olv'd in
hot Water, they are the mo&s;t clean&s;ing and
diluting of all Medicines, &s;o their <HI>Steel</HI> (as I
have already &s;aid) is the mo&s;t effectual for bra|cing
the Solids: And with &s;uch a Compo&s;ition
it would be pretty &s;trange they &s;hould not (if
any Means could) be &s;ucce&s;sful in &s;uch Ca&s;es.
They may rai&s;e &s;ome Mi&s;t and Dimne&s;s be|fore
the Eyes in foul Stomachs, nay even occa|&s;ion
&s;ome Head-Aches and Flatulence, which
may properly enough be call'd <HI>Vapouri&s;h</HI> or
<HI>Nervous;</HI> but the &s;ame every active Remedy
will produce; and the&s;e may be ea&s;ily reme|died,
by joining &s;ome <HI>Volatiles, Aromaticks</HI>
or <HI>Bitters</HI> along with them. If they have
not the greate&s;t Benefit is expected, it is be|cau&s;e
the <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicines mention'd, and
tho&s;e for the <HI>fir&s;t Intention,</HI> have not before,
upon fir&s;t drinking them, been &s;ufficiently
and long enough per&s;i&s;ted in; for certainly
they are the mo&s;t agreeable and beneficial
<HI>Vehicle</HI> for &s;uch Medicines, and the mo&s;t
&s;ure Remedy, after &s;uch a Cour&s;e, to be found
on the <HI>Globe,</HI> as I have long experienced. The
greate&s;t Misfortune is, that their Relief does
not la&s;t for a very long Time, at lea&s;t not at
an equal Heighth. But that is the Misfortune
of all Remedies in bad Ca&s;es and Con&s;titu|tions,
<PB N="149" REF="185">
and their beneficial Effects will la&s;t
longer than that of any other Remedy, under
the Management I have mention'd.</P>

Method of Cure of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;|tempers,
the &s;everal <HI>Intentions</HI> to be follow'd
in the Pro&s;ecution of it, and the be&s;t Medi|cines
I can &s;ugge&s;t from Experience, Ob&s;er|vation,
or the Nature of Things, for fulfilling
each of the&s;e <HI>Intentions;</HI> I come now to the
<HI>Diaetetick</HI> Management, <HI>that Part</HI> which
has the greate&s;t Influence in the Cure of
<HI>Chronical Di&s;tempers,</HI> without which the be&s;t
and &s;ure&s;t Remedies fail of their Effect, and
yet in the&s;e later Ages the lea&s;t <HI>cultivated</HI> and
mo&s;t neglected of all the curative Parts of
Phy&s;ick in <HI>England,</HI> (till of late, that <HI>my wor|thy,

<PB N="150" REF="186">

he executes every thing he undertakes) in&s;o|much
that he hazards the Charge of intro|ducing
new and whim&s;ical Opinions, who
would pretend to &s;tand up in its Defence,
or bring it into his Practice. And yet, if we
will make but a &s;lender Enquiry into the
Practice of the early and pure&s;t Ages of <HI>Phy|&s;ick,</HI>
or the great and univer&s;ally approv'd
<HI>Writers</HI> in the healing <HI>Art,</HI> we &s;hall find
<HI>Diet</HI> no &s;uch contemptible Help towards the
Prevention or Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es, as it is now
held or imagin'd. On the contrary, we &s;hall
find the Works of all the mo&s;t judicious and
celebrated Practitioners full of particular Di|rections
and Advices on this <HI>Topick</HI> in every
Di&s;ea&s;e they treat of; and demon&s;trating that
their <HI>Authors,</HI> as they did not find, &s;o they
did not imagine, that any (at lea&s;t habitual
and rooted) Di&s;temper, could be remov'd
without &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance. We are certainly
provided with a greater Choice of more

Forms of Medicines, than the <HI>Antients;</HI> and
this probably will &s;till increa&s;e, by length of
Time, with <HI>Arts,</HI> the Knowledge of Nature,
and even of our Di&s;ea&s;es; but what is, and
will be ever admired among the <HI>Antients,</HI> is
their <HI>Method of Cure,</HI> the Truth and Ju&s;t|ne&s;s

of their <HI>Intentions</HI> in following the Di|rections
of Nature in the Way &s;he intends or
<PB N="151" REF="187">
points out. <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> the Father of the
<HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> thought a <HI>Regimen of Diet</HI> of &s;uch
Con&s;equence, both to the <HI>Healthy</HI> and the
<HI>Sick,</HI> that of about <HI>ninety Books</HI> of his which
remain, or that pa&s;s under his Name, there
are eight of them which treat of that Matter
only or principally; and thro' all the re&s;t of
his Works, he mentions much more of his
<HI>Diaetetick</HI> Management, than any A&s;&s;i&s;tance
he took from the <HI>Materia Medica.</HI> He com|plains,
that<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Epidem. lib. 6.</NOTE> tho&s;e who went before him,
had written nothing concerning the <HI>Diet</HI> of
&s;ick Per&s;ons, which was neverthele&s;s one of
the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Parts of <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> even in
his Time, which we may ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;e
wanted it le&s;s than later Ages. <HI>Galen,</HI> tho'
more abounding in Medicines, yet is far
from depriving Diet of its due Place. On
the contrary he declares,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De u&s;u Theriaces ad Pamphylianum.</NOTE> <HI>&startq;That Phy&s;ick has
no Remedy &s;o effectual as to be able to bring
its wanted Relief where the Regimen of

And in another Place he &s;ays,<NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 5. De Sanitate tuenda.</NOTE> <HI>&startq;That by
means of that part of Phy&s;ick which pre|&s;cribes
a proper Diet, tho&s;e who have
deriv'd too tender and weakly a Con&s;titution
from their Parents, have brought them&s;elves
on to extreme old Age, without any Weak|ne&s;s
<PB N="152" REF="188">
of their Sen&s;es, free from all Pain and
Di&s;ea&s;es.&endq;</HI> He adds afterwards concerning
him&s;elf, <HI>&startq;Even I, tho' I had not a healthy
Con&s;titution from my Birth, nor led a Life
of much Freedom and Ea&s;e of Mind, yet by
the Precepts of this mo&s;t u&s;eful part of Phy|&s;ick,
which I practi&s;ed after the 28th Year
of my Age, I never fell into any Di&s;temper,
except a &s;light Fever of 24 Hours through
Wearine&s;s or Exce&s;s of Labour.&endq;</HI> The
<HI>Methodi&s;ts,</HI> a celebrated <HI>Sect</HI> among the An|tient
Phy&s;icians, laid the main Stre&s;s of the
Cure upon <HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Evacuations;</HI> and &s;ome
of them carry'd this to an extravagant Heighth.
But <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> who &s;eems to have judiciou&s;ly
di&s;tingui&s;h'd, and kept in a proper <HI>Medium</HI>
between the Extremes, that the different <HI>Sects</HI>
of <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> in his Time, had carry'd each their
particular and favourite Doctrines to, was yet
&s;ufficiently &s;en&s;ible and convinc'd of the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of a proper <HI>Diet</HI> in the Cure of Di&s;|ea&s;es;
for he is not only large and full in his
Directions and Regulations about it, in every
particular Di&s;ea&s;e he treats of: but where he
di&s;tingui&s;hes between internal and external
Di&s;orders, he calls the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> tho&s;e in which
the Regulation of <HI>Diet</HI> is the principal Part
of the Cure, and the <HI>latter</HI> tho&s;e where <HI>Me|dicines</HI>
make the chief Part of it. Even in
the &s;ame Place, where he takes &s;ome Pains
to refute the Doctrine of <HI>A&s;clepiades,</HI> who
maintain'd that all Di&s;ea&s;es were to be cured
<PB N="153" REF="189">
by <HI>Diet</HI> alone, and to re&s;tore Medicines to their
proper Place. He goes further, to enjoin
<HI>ab&s;olute Fa&s;ting</HI> in the fir&s;t Attacks of a Di&s;|order,
and a &s;trict Moderation in the Quan|tity
as well as Quality of the Food, during
all the Time that the Di&s;ea&s;e continues; for
nothing, <HI>he &s;ays,</HI> is more beneficial to a &s;ick
Per&s;on, than <HI>timely Ab&s;tinence.</HI> Then he pro|ceeds
to &s;hew the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch a
Conduct, and to blame and reprove tho&s;e
luxurious Per&s;ons, who will allow their <HI>Phy|&s;icians</HI>
to determine the Kind and Quantity
of their Food, but re&s;erve to them&s;elves the
Times of taking it; or who think they act
very generou&s;ly if they &s;ubmit to his Regula|tions
in every thing be&s;ides the Kinds or Qua|lities
of it: and ends with a&s;&s;uring them of
the extreme Hurtfulne&s;s of any Error, either
in the Quality, the Quantity, or the Times
of taking their Nouri&s;hment. It were end|le&s;s
to produce Authorities for a Thing that
makes a great Part of the Works of all the
&s;tandard Writers in Phy&s;ick, I mention the&s;e
only, becau&s;e they are acknowledg'd the great
Ma&s;ters in this <HI>Science,</HI> and who&s;e Evidences
mu&s;t of Con&s;equence, include the Suffrages
of all their Approvers and Admirers; and as
they will be &s;ufficient to give the Reader, who
is not conver&s;ant in the&s;e Matters, a ju&s;t Notion
of the Con&s;equence of <HI>Diet</HI> in the Cure of
Di&s;ea&s;es. For I do not pretend to add (by
what I have here &s;aid) any thing to the Know|ledge
<PB N="154" REF="190">
of tho&s;e who&s;e Study or Profe&s;&s;ion has
led them to &s;earch into the&s;e Affairs, &s;ince
they will not want Conviction. But here one
will naturally inquire how &s;o nece&s;&s;ary and
e&s;&s;ential a Part of <HI>Phy&s;ick</HI> comes to be in &s;uch
Di&s;grace, and &s;o little regarded, as it is at
pre&s;ent, &s;ince it was &s;o much recommended,
and made up &s;o great a Part of the Practice
of the mo&s;t admired <HI>Phy&s;icians.</HI> The Origi|nal
of this Evil &s;eems to be owing to &s;ome
over-zealous Abettors of <HI>Chymi&s;try.</HI> The <HI>Al|chymi&s;ts,</HI>
or more conceited and whim&s;ical
&s;ort of <HI>Chymi&s;ts,</HI> were the great Men, that,
depending &s;olely upon Medicines, endeavour'd
to di&s;credit <HI>Diet</HI> in the Cure of Di&s;ea&s;es,
bragging and ranting in Honour of their <HI>Pa|nacaea's,
Elixirs of Life,</HI> and other wonderful
<HI>Secrets,</HI> which, if you will believe the In|ventors
and Admirers of them, were &s;uffi|cient,
without any other Means, even a <HI>Re|gimen
of Diet,</HI> or whatever all Phy&s;icians be|fore
had thought mo&s;t indi&s;pen&s;ible, to work
infallible Cures in the mo&s;t de&s;perate Di&s;ea&s;es.
It was this, and nothing el&s;e, they pretended
to. When once &s;uch an ill Practice is &s;et
on foot, the Patients them&s;elves, as <HI>Cel&s;us</HI>
ob&s;erv'd in his Time, are &s;o aver&s;e to being
confin'd by di&s;agreeable Re&s;traints, that they are
prepar'd to believe every Impo&s;tor, that will
take upon him to di&s;pen&s;e with the mo&s;t ne|ce&s;&s;ary
Condition of Cure, and entertain a

Truth. But where the <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI>
<PB N="157" REF="193">
of all the Nations on the <HI>Globe</HI> are brought
together, mingled and blended, and perhaps
heighten'd by the Difference of <HI>Climates,</HI> there
is an ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity that the <HI>Materials of
Phy&s;ick,</HI> and the Methods of Cure, &s;hould be
various and extended in an equal Proportion:
which is the Cau&s;e of the Multiplicity of our
Medicines, and the Nece&s;&s;ity that <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI>
are under to know almo&s;t every Thing that
is knowable in Nature, for the U&s;e of <HI>Phy&s;ick:</HI>
and to bring from each <HI>Country</HI> and <HI>Climate</HI>
the proper <HI>Antidote</HI> for the Di&s;temper brought
from thence.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. THERE is al&s;o another <HI>infinitely wi&s;e</HI>
Contrivance in Nature, that <HI>Loathing</HI> and <HI>In|appetency,</HI>
or at lea&s;t a Difficulty in Dige&s;tion,
always attends, in &s;ome Degree or other, all
Di&s;orders what&s;oever. Were every one that
is a little ill, capable of the &s;ame <HI>Riot</HI> and <HI>Ex|ce&s;s</HI>
during their Di&s;temper that they were
when in perfect Health, when they laid in
the Materials of their Di&s;orders, they would
infallibly and quickly ruin them&s;elves, and
peri&s;h without Re&s;ource: Whereas by this
wi&s;e Nece&s;&s;ity, they are not only hinder'd
from adding <HI>Oil</HI> to the <HI>Flame,</HI> but find a new
Increa&s;e of their Pains and Puni&s;hments, up|on
the &s;malle&s;t Exce&s;s, which puts them un|der
the Nece&s;&s;ity of forbearing: if the Plea|&s;ure
of gratifying their Sen&s;uality is not greater
than the Sen&s;e of the Pain. And in &s;ome
<PB N="158" REF="194">
Ca&s;es, where there has been a great Di&s;po|&s;ition
towards <HI>Luxury</HI> in the Patient, and
where the Cure depended only or chiefly
upon <HI>Ab&s;tinence,</HI> I have with Plea&s;ure ad|mired
the Art and Ingenuity of a <HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI>
who, to keep up his Patient's Spirits during
the tedious Cure, and gain the Advantages
of Temperance and Ab&s;tinence as much as
he was able, has pre&s;crib'd a Cour&s;e of in|nocent,
tho' neither palatable nor appetizing
Medicines, for a long time, without teazing
his Patient with the di&s;piriting and mortify|ing
Doctrine of <HI>Self-Denial,</HI> which either he
had de&s;pi&s;ed, or not receiv'd in its proper
Degree and Manner, and thus effected the
Cure, which otherwi&s;e had been impo&s;&s;i|ble.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. THERE is no &s;urer or more gene|ral
<HI>Maxim</HI> in <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> than that Di&s;ea&s;es are
cured by the contrary or oppo&s;ite Methods
to that which produc'd them. If <HI>Nervous</HI>
Di&s;orders are the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Wealthy,
the Voluptuous, and the Lazy, (as I have
already &s;hewn) and are mo&s;tly produc'd, and
always aggravated and increa&s;ed, by <HI>Luxury</HI>
and <HI>Intemperance</HI> (tho' perhaps not always
an ab&s;olute and outragious Intemperance, yet
certainly by one relative to the particular
Con&s;titution and Strength of the Patient)
there needs no great Depth of Penetration to
find out that <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Ab&s;tinence</HI> is
<PB N="159" REF="195">
nece&s;&s;ary towards their <HI>Cure.</HI> But as there
are different Stages or Degrees of the&s;e Di&s;|orders,
and even &s;eemingly different <HI>Kinds</HI>
of them, according to the Prevalency of this
or that particular Quality in the Materials of
the general Cau&s;e: whereby different Effects,
Appearances, and Symptoms are produc'd
with greater or le&s;&s;er Violence, and longer
or &s;horter Duration; &s;o different Regulations
in the Quantity and Quality of the Food, is
nece&s;&s;ary towards their Removal: I &s;hall
therefore fir&s;t give &s;ome <HI>general</HI> Directions in
the&s;e two la&s;t Particulars, and afterwards
&s;ubjoin &s;ome Con&s;iderations, to be made in
the Application to particular Ca&s;es.</P>

it is nece&s;&s;ary, 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> That it be &s;oft and ten|der,
light and ea&s;y of Dige&s;tion, and afford|ing
a mild or <HI>Bal&s;amick Chyle;</HI> that its Ma|terials
be &s;ound and good in their Kind, and
fitted for U&s;e, without the artful Compo&s;ures
of <HI>Cookery,</HI> or the Means us'd commonly in
making it more <HI>lu&s;cious and palatable;</HI> and
likewi&s;e, that it be the mo&s;t &s;imple and un|compounded,
and that fewe&s;t different Mate|rials
po&s;&s;ible be receiv'd into the &s;ame Meal;
for as they will only &s;erve to provoke Exce&s;s,

<P>&sect;. VI. THE Quantity of the Food mu&s;t
be proportion'd to the Strength of the Dige|&s;tion,
and the Wa&s;te or Decay of the Fluids,
from Exerci&s;e or bodily Action, or to the
pre&s;ent Fulne&s;s of the Habit, and Ob&s;truction
of the natural <HI>Secretions.</HI> But as it is impo&s;|&s;ible
to give <HI>general Rules</HI> in the&s;e Ca&s;es,
wherein almo&s;t every individual Per&s;on differs
<PB N="161" REF="197">
from another, or even from him&s;elf at diffe|rent
Times, &s;o the preci&s;e Regulation of this
mu&s;t be left to the Patient's own Feelings,
and the Hone&s;ty and Experience of his <HI>Phy|&s;ician.</HI>
A few Ob&s;ervations upon the Quan|tity
that agrees be&s;t, &s;its ea&s;ie&s;t and lighte&s;t
on the Stomach, gives no Oppre&s;&s;ion, Heavi|ne&s;s,
Heat or Feveri&s;hne&s;s, while it is dige&s;t|ing,
and pa&s;&s;es off without any ill Effects,
will mo&s;t readily determine it for the Patient;
and it is of &s;o great Con&s;equence to the Wel|fare
of the Patient, that no Pains ought to
be &s;par'd for attaining the Knowledge of this
preci&s;e and precious <HI>Mediocrity,</HI> which ought,
as &s;eldom as po&s;&s;ible, to be tran&s;gre&s;s'd either
way.</P>
<P>&sect;. VII. THOSE who have only a few
tran&s;ient Symptoms of the&s;e Di&s;orders: who&s;e
Con&s;titution is yet &s;ound, and their Juices
good and &s;weet: if they live with a due De|gree
of Temperance &s;uited to their Con&s;titu|tions,
and take care not to increa&s;e their Di&s;|orders
by Exce&s;&s;es, will need no other Re|&s;triction,
than to abate of their Quantity while
they are more immediately under the&s;e <HI>Symp|toms:</HI>
will gradually get rid of their Di&s;tem|per,
and avoid violent Shocks, or great
Sufferings: and be re&s;tor'd to their former
Health and Freedom of Spirits, by the other
A&s;&s;i&s;tances of Medicine and Exerci&s;e. Tho&s;e
who have deeper, more habitual and violent
<PB N="162" REF="198">
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> will need a greater Degree of
Care and Caution; and their Stomach being
weaker, and their Dige&s;tion going on &s;lower,
will be nece&s;&s;itated to choo&s;e the lighte&s;t and
mo&s;t ea&s;ily dige&s;ted Foods, and the &s;malle&s;t
Quantity of <HI>&s;pirituous Liquors:</HI> and will &s;uf|fer
in Proportion as they exceed the Quantity
that is determin'd by the mentioned Ob&s;er|vations.
For &s;uch the lighte&s;t, young, and
<HI>white</HI> Animal Foods only, are nece&s;&s;ary, and
the&s;e al&s;o only at Dinner. And if they are
&s;ubject to violent and acute <HI>Paroxy&s;ms,</HI> they
mu&s;t be more than ordinary careful about the&s;e
Times, and then even u&s;e a cooler, &s;ofter,
and more liquid Diet. In general, they mu&s;t
govern them&s;elves by their Feelings, and
take no more at a Time than their Stomach
will ea&s;ily bear, but rather repeat it oftner;
and they ought always to wait till their Ap|petite
returns in its u&s;ual Degree, and they
will even find, however moderate or ab&s;te|mious
they may &s;eem, that upon any Low|ne&s;s,
Heavine&s;s, or Want of Spirits, &s;till
lighter Meals will re&s;tore their Chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect;. VIII. BUT as for all tho&s;e who&s;e
Con&s;titutions are &s;poiled, who have bad or
corrupted Juices, violent and dangerous
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> great <HI>Ob&s;tructions,</HI> are &s;ubject to the
great and eminent Degrees of the&s;e Di&s;orders,
are threaten'd with <HI>Hectic</HI> or <HI>Con&s;umption</HI> (o$
a De&s;truction of &s;ome of the great <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI>
<PB N="163" REF="199">
and who have tried all the other Methods
and Medicines that could be &s;ugge&s;ted with|out
Succe&s;s) for the&s;e I have found no
other Relief than a <HI>total Ab&s;tinence</HI> from
Animal Foods of all Kinds, and all Sorts of
&s;trong and fermented Liquors, keeping only
to Milk, with Seeds or Grains, and the dif|ferent
Kinds of Vegetable Food, according
to the Nature of the Di&s;temper: from which
they have never fail'd to find a pre&s;ent Re|lief,
and a con&s;iderable Abatement of the
Violence of their Symptoms. Many have
been led into this Method without any Ad|vice
or Direction, but merely from their
own Feelings, and ob&s;erving what they were
ea&s;ie&s;t under. And many more have been
ab&s;olutely cur'd and free'd from all their
Di&s;orders by it: &s;ome even from a very
&s;hort Time after they enter'd upon it, and
others in a longer or &s;horter Time, accord|ing
to the Ob&s;tinacy of their Di&s;temper, if
the Di&s;ea&s;e has not been &s;o far gone, as to be
part all po&s;&s;ible Relief from natural Means.
In the&s;e la&s;t Ca&s;es it has done all that was in
the Power of <HI>Art,</HI> has le&s;&s;en'd their Mi&s;eries,
and protracted their Fate, and has given
more Ea&s;e and Quiet than they could re|ceive
from any other Method they could
turn to, except <HI>Opiates</HI> and <HI>Anodyn's:</HI> to
which one is never to give him&s;elf, till he
has given up all Hopes of a total Cure.
Where the <HI>Nerves</HI> or Solids are naturally
<PB N="164" REF="200">
weak, or the Per&s;on &s;ubject to <HI>nervous
Di&s;orders</HI> from their Infancy, there is no
Method will ab&s;olutely free them from &s;ome
&s;light Returns of their former Symptoms; but
this <HI>Diet</HI> I have found to do more than any
other Method whatever: however, no one
ought to undertake this Regimen, without
the Advice of &s;ome hone&s;t, able, and expe|rienced
<HI>Phy&s;ician,</HI> who has con&s;ider'd his
Ca&s;e and Con&s;titution, and can direct him
aright in the proper Management of it, and
the Methods of keeping up the due <HI>Ten&s;ion</HI>
of his Solids, which &s;uch a <HI>Diet</HI> may pro|bably
&s;omewhat relax, while it is purifying
the Juices, and clean&s;ing the Habit: and ca$$
likewi&s;e judge of his Con&s;tancy, Firmne&s;s,
and Re&s;olution to go through with it, &s;ince
in &s;ome deep rooted and confirm'd Di&s;tem|pers
of this Kind, though the Patient may
find a con&s;iderable Relief for many Months
yet po&s;&s;ibly when the gro&s;s Impurities,
the <HI>Choler, Phlegm,</HI> and <HI>Salts</HI> &s;tor'd up in
the Habit, come to be thrown off on the
<HI>Alimentary Tube,</HI> as into the common
Shore, and all the <HI>Emunctory</HI> Glands be|come
loaded with the <HI>De&s;pumation</HI> of the
whole Habit: rai&s;ing Sickne&s;s, Lowne&s;s of
Spirits, and a Return of all, or many, of the
former Di&s;orders; this may bla&s;t all his
Hopes, and mightily di&s;courage him, and
make him condemn the Method, and blame
the Phy&s;ician who advis'd him. But if he
<PB N="165" REF="201">
&s;tands this Shock with Firmne&s;s and Pa|tience
(which will be readily relieved by pro|per
<HI>Evacuations, Volatiles</HI> and <HI>A&s;tringents</HI>) he
may be a&s;&s;ured of Succe&s;s, and his perfect Re|covery
is at Hand. But as there are incurable
Di&s;orders, which no Method or Medicine will
reach, &s;o it frequently happens in this: And
even after the Patient is recover'd by this Me|thod,
he mu&s;t re&s;olve to continue in it ever after,
at lea&s;t, not to indulge him&s;elf in a much
higher Degree of Food, without &s;uffering
pre&s;ently, or hazarding a Return of all his
Di&s;orders; for as <HI>Cel&s;us</HI> ob&s;erves, in all Di&s;|orders
of the Stomach, <HI>by whatever Methods
the Patient is recover'd, he mu&s;t continue in
the &s;ame when he is well, for the Di&s;ea&s;e will
return, unle&s;s Health be protected by the &s;ame
Means that re&s;tor'd it.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. IX. I WOULD not be under&s;tood here
(as &s;ome have maliciou&s;ly and artfully mi&s;|repre&s;ented
me, contrary to my mo&s;t deli|berate
Intention) to recommend a <HI>total Milk</HI>
or a <HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI> or indeed any particu|lar
one, to every one that is &s;ick, or out of
Order: I never once had &s;uch a Dream. I
have given the Preference in my <HI>E&s;&s;ay on the
Gout,</HI> to the common Diet of well-cho&s;en
Fle&s;h Meat, and good middling ripe Wine,
even in that ob&s;tinate and painful Di&s;temper,
commonly treated by a Milk Diet. And in
my <HI>E&s;&s;ay on Health and Long Life,</HI> I have
<PB N="166" REF="202">
endeavour'd, as far as I could, to enable the
Patient to make the proper Choice of Animal
Foods fit for his Con&s;titution, and the Di&s;|orders
he labours under; and have, from con|&s;idering
the Nature of the Di&s;temper, actually
order'd &s;ome who were in a <HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI>
to change it for an <HI>Animal</HI> one. A total
<HI>Milk and Vegetable</HI> Diet, be&s;ides its being
<HI>particular</HI> and inconvenient in a Country
where Animal Food is the common Diet,
and affording no &s;ufficient Store of Animal or
Mechanical Strength (to Per&s;ons naturally
weak, or who have not been habituated to
it from their Cradles) may bring the Patient
into &s;uch a State, that, without the utmo&s;t
Ri&s;que or Danger, he can never leave it off
again. And even while he is under it, by
relaxing and &s;oftening the Solids, (in &s;ome
Degree) when it is a &s;weetening the Juices,
it brings him under a Nece&s;&s;ity of keeping up
their Ten&s;ion with proper a&s;tringent, warm,
and cordial Medicines, (which are of the
&s;ame Nature with a more generous Diet) and
ince&s;&s;ant Labour and Exerci&s;e: And in gro&s;s
foul Bodies, or tho&s;e &s;ubject to <HI>gouti&s;h, &s;cor|butick,</HI>
or other <HI>inflammatory Di&s;orders</HI> and
<HI>Paroxy&s;ms:</HI> requires the utmo&s;t Care and
Caution that the Di&s;ea&s;e be not thereby at
fir&s;t, thrown inwards, and &s;o the extreme De|grees
of Vapours, Lowne&s;s, and other <HI>Ner|vous</HI>
Di&s;orders en&s;ue, which this <HI>Diet</HI> is de|&s;ign'd
to prevent. Indeed there are &s;ome
<PB N="167" REF="203">
Ca&s;es wherein a <HI>Vegetable</HI> and <HI>Milk Diet</HI>
&s;eems ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, as in <HI>&s;evere</HI> and
<HI>habitual Gouts, Rheumati&s;ms, Cancerous, Le|prous,</HI>
and <HI>Scrophulous</HI> Di&s;orders, extreme
<HI>Nervous Cholicks, Epilep&s;ies,</HI> violent <HI>Hy|&s;terick
Fits, Melancholly, Con&s;umptions,</HI>
and the like Di&s;ea&s;es mentioned in the Pre|face,
and towards the la&s;t Stages of all chro|nical
Di&s;tempers; in &s;uch Di&s;tempers I have
&s;eldom &s;een &s;uch a <HI>Diet</HI> fail of a good Effect
at la&s;t. But in mo&s;t other <HI>Chronical Di&s;tem|pers,
Nervous</HI> or <HI>Humourous,</HI> and in all their
tolerable Degrees, and fir&s;t or &s;econd Stages,
a common middling, plain and moderate
Diet is certainly the be&s;t and &s;afe&s;t; a little
<HI>Animal</HI> Food of the younge&s;t, lighte&s;t, ten|dere&s;t,
thinne&s;t, and &s;weete&s;t Kind, and a
&s;mall Proportion of generous Liquors, to
keep up the due <HI>Ten&s;ion</HI> of the Solids, under
the Regulations I have mention'd; weak
Broths and Soops made of tender young
Animal Sub&s;tances, without Fat or Butter,
and thicken'd with a due Proportion of Ve|getable
Seeds or Grains, &s;uch as tho&s;e of
Wheat, Barley, Rice, Sage, Oats, Millet,
and the like: Such a <HI>Diet,</HI> I &s;ay, will, in my
Opinion, an&s;wer all the Ends of pure <HI>Milk</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables;</HI> and as I have often found
&s;uch an one le&s;s dangerous, &s;o it is a more
ea&s;y Regulation, as things now &s;tand: and
wants only a few Months in the &s;ame
Cour&s;e, of that Cure that might be gain'd
<PB N="168" REF="204">
perhaps by going into &s;uch a particular Me|thod
of Diet. I am never for entering up|on
<HI>extreme</HI> or uncommon Means of <HI>Diet</HI> or
<HI>Medicines,</HI> but in extreme and mortal Ca&s;es;
for I always think that <HI>common Sen&s;e</HI> is the
be&s;t Indication of a &s;ound Mind, and <HI>common
Life</HI> the be&s;t Means of temporal Happine&s;s,
el&s;e they had never been common.</P>
<P>&sect;. X. ONE great <HI>Advantage</HI> that a <HI>Milk</HI>
and <HI>Vegetable Diet</HI> has over a Fle&s;h or <HI>Ani|mal</HI>
one, lies principally in this, that one
may thereby avoid the Loading the Juices
with too many <HI>Salts</HI> of any Kind, or thicken|ing
them with more gro&s;s and hard earthy
Particles, or &s;uch as cannot be broken and
comminuted by the natural Force of the
weak Solids: and by it Patients will not be
&s;o readily led into Errors in the Quantity;
Nature not being tempted to receive or
retain &s;uch unprovoking and impoignant
Viands, whereby they avoid the <HI>Snare</HI> and
<HI>Temptation</HI> that Liquori&s;hne&s;s and high Re|li&s;h
throws many into. <HI>Another</HI> Advantage
is, that it effectually dilutes and cools too
thick or hot Juices, and that a &s;ufficient Quan|tity
of it may be taken to keep the Bowels
and Blood Ve&s;&s;els full, and &s;ufficiently turgid,
whereby the <HI>Circulation</HI> and natural Evacua|tions
and Secretions will be more uniformly
carried on in &s;uch weak Habits, than can po&s;|&s;ibly
be under an <HI>Animal Diet</HI> of &s;o &s;mall a
<PB N="169" REF="205">
Quantity as mu&s;t be nece&s;&s;ary in &s;uch Ca&s;es,
unle&s;s it be extremely diluted with Water,
and the farinaceous Vegetables, which brings
it to the &s;ame State: And therefore, in great|ly
depraved Habits, and &s;uch deep and dan|gerous
Di&s;ea&s;es as I have mention'd, it is the
mo&s;t proper and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary Regi|men
to carry on the natural Functions with|out
Pain and Unea&s;ine&s;s, and to pre&s;erve the
Sides of the Capillary Ve&s;&s;els from <HI>coale&s;cing</HI>
and growing together, and &s;o preventing
irremediable Ob&s;tructions; tho' in other
more &s;light Ca&s;es, it may be not only not ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
but even &s;ometimes inconvenient and
hurtful: For tho' it will always produce at
length Freedom from Pain, and Freedom of
Spirits, and a greater Capacity for intellectual
Functions, yet it will never beget <HI>mechani|cal</HI>
Force and Strength, or a hardy, &s;trong
Con&s;titution, which in &s;ome Circum&s;tances,
Employments, Trades, and Profe&s;&s;ions, is
indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary; &s;o that &s;uch a
Cour&s;e and <HI>Regimen</HI> is only proper for tho&s;e
who follow <HI>Intellectual</HI> Occupations, and ex|pect
chiefly mental Plea&s;ures, Freedom from
Pain, Chearfulne&s;s and Length of Days, or,
in &s;hort, for the Studious and Sedentary.</P>
<P>&sect;. XI. THE Sum of the Whole, in my
Opinion, is this: Our Di&s;tempers generally
ari&s;e from <HI>Oils, Salts,</HI> and <HI>Spirits,</HI> carried
into the Habit by our Food; nothing el&s;e but
<PB N="170" REF="206">
the&s;e, in the Nature of Things, having <HI>Force</HI>
enough to produce them. Some certain
Proportion of the&s;e is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to
excite, rouze, and carry on the <HI>Circulation,
Per&s;piration,</HI> and all the <HI>Secretions</HI> with their
proper Force and Vigour: When the Juices
are too vi&s;cid or acrimonious, or the Ob|&s;tructions
many and great, <HI>Diet</HI> offers us
one of the &s;ure&s;t Means to cure the&s;e ill
Qualities. All <HI>Salts,</HI> in their general Na|ture,
are of the &s;ame Kind, Hard, and
highly Attractive, and differ only as they
are &s;maller or greater in their Parts, and
according to the Earths, Oils, and other
Mixtures that unite them, or mix with them.
<HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> have but little &s;aline
Matter in Proportion to their Bulk, and
therefore a <HI>total Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI>
may, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, defraud the Con&s;titu|tion
of that due Proportion of <HI>Salts</HI> nece&s;&s;ary
for the mention'd Purpo&s;es, and for want of
which the Solids may become too lax and
feeble. But, on the other hand, too great a
Quantity of Fle&s;h Meat, and hot fermented
Liquors, or that which is of too <HI>&s;aline</HI> and
<HI>&s;pirituous</HI> a Nature, will load the <HI>Habit</HI> with
too many of the&s;e Salts and Oils, and &s;o
beget the mention'd Di&s;tempers. The great
<HI>Art of Life</HI> then, in <HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers, is
to a&s;certain the <HI>Mediocrity</HI> of &s;uch a <HI>Diet</HI> as
neither makes the Salts and Oils too many
to increa&s;e the Di&s;temper, nor too few, to
<PB N="171" REF="207">
let the Solids become too much relax'd.
Animal Food then, and Spirituous Liquors
become more tolerable in <HI>Northern Climates,</HI>
where the Want of &s;ufficient <HI>Sun,</HI> and the
Moi&s;ture of the <HI>Air,</HI> makes the Solids of
&s;omewhat too loo&s;e and flabby a Nature, and
&s;o require a greater Proportion of Salts and
Oils, needful to rouze and twitch them,
than in more <HI>Southern Climates.</HI> Suppo&s;e,
for Example, a Dram of Salts, and Oils or
Spirits in twenty-four Hours was nece&s;&s;ary;
then certainly that <HI>Diet</HI> which conveys this
Dram of Salts and Oils in the whole Sub&s;tance
of the Food, according to the Bulk, Age,
and Expences of the Life of the Patient,
into the Habit, will be the be&s;t, of whatever
Kind it may be. But if, by an Over-charge
of Salts and Oils, Di&s;ea&s;es are brought on,
and are to be remedied by a <HI>Diet</HI> wherein
one half of this Quantity is found; then &s;uch
Food is to be cho&s;en, or &s;uch a Quantity
of it taken, as will convey into the Habit
only half a Dram of &s;uch: and if that End
can be obtain'd by following the common
and ordinary <HI>Diet</HI> of the Country and Cli|mate,
and of the healthie&s;t People in it, then
that is, beyond di&s;pute, the be&s;t Regimen
in general to pre&s;erve Health. Under Di&s;|ea&s;es
the Ca&s;e is different. So that there can
be no Room for mi&s;taking the proper Kind
of <HI>Diet,</HI> nor the Validity of the Rea&s;ons on
which it is founded. The only Difficulty
<PB N="172" REF="208">
that remains, will be in choo&s;ing &s;uch Kinds,
and that Quantity of <HI>Animal Food</HI> which be&s;t
&s;uits the Age, Bulk, and Con&s;titution of the
Patient, and conveys only the nece&s;&s;ary
Quantity of <HI>Salts</HI> and Oils. To determine
which was the chief De&s;ign of my <HI>E&s;&s;ay on
Health and Long Life,</HI> and of Dr. <HI>Arbuthnott</HI>'s
<HI>Book of Aliments,</HI> and which is evidently of
the greate&s;t Con&s;equence to all who would

<PB N="173" REF="209">
In the <HI>Southern</HI> Climates, as there is &s;carce
any, at lea&s;t few, <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers of
the lingering and <HI>chronical</HI> Kind, &s;o there
is very little Room for <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> merely for
Health: The Warmth and Action of the
<HI>Sun,</HI> keeping the Blood and Juices &s;ufficient|ly
fluid, the <HI>Circulation</HI> free, and all the
<HI>Secretions</HI> in their due Degree and Plenty,

Thinne&s;s, Coolne&s;s, and Lightne&s;s of their
almo&s;t <HI>Vegetable Diet</HI> contributes not a little.
But in the more <HI>Northern</HI> and colder Cli|mates,
where the Food is more gro&s;s, higher
and harder of Dige&s;tion, being mo&s;tly Ani|mal;
where the <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> is &s;mall, or
&s;carce any at all, e&s;pecially in <HI>Nervous</HI> or
<HI>chronical</HI> Di&s;tempers, there is an ab&s;olute

For it would be ab&s;urd to propo&s;e to
them to take long continued Journies in
their &s;corching <HI>Climate</HI> for the Cure of
Di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. WHEN Mankind was &s;imple, plain,
hone&s;t, and frugal, there were few or no
Di&s;ea&s;es. <HI>Temperance, Exerci&s;e, Hunting,
Labour,</HI> and <HI>Indu&s;try</HI> kept the Juices &s;weet,
and the Solids brac'd. The <HI>Spiritual</HI> Pa&s;|&s;ions,
however, raged and boiled high;
tho&s;e, to wit, of <HI>Ambition, Malice, Re|venge,</HI>
and <HI>Pride,</HI> which beget <HI>U&s;urpation,
Conque&s;ts, Murder,</HI> and <HI>Wars: Labour</HI> and
<HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> were ob&s;erv'd to beget Firmne&s;s,
Strength, and Activity for the&s;e Purpo&s;es.
It was afterwards introduc'd into the <HI>Reli|gious
Wor&s;hip. Rewards</HI> and <HI>Honours</HI> were
appointed for the <HI>Victors</HI> in the&s;e <HI>&s;acred</HI>
Conte&s;ts. But Luxury and Intemperance
having gain'd Ground, thro' Peace, Security,
Ea&s;e, and Plenty, Di&s;ea&s;es &s;prang up and
multiplied. <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> and <HI>Labour</HI> were intro|duc'd
into their Cure by <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> who
had ob&s;erv'd the Health and Vigour of the
<PB N="175" REF="211">
Laborious and Active.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Galen. Cap. 58. lib. ad Thra&s;ybulum.</NOTE> <HI>Hippocrates, Diocles,
Paraxagoras,</HI> and <HI>Era&s;i&s;tratus</HI> fir&s;t introduc'd
it into <HI>Rules, Laws,</HI> and <HI>Order;</HI> appointing
the Times and Kinds of it, appropriated to
each particular Di&s;temper. The <HI>Grecians</HI> in
general, the <HI>Athenians</HI> and <HI>Lacedemonians</HI> in
particular, erected <HI>Academies, Gymna&s;ia,</HI> or
publick Places, for the common Conveniency
of all Kinds of Exerci&s;e, with all proper Ac|commodations
and Services for that End,
both to train up the People for <HI>War,</HI> and to
pre&s;erve them from, and cure their Di&s;ea&s;es.
The&s;e <HI>Gymna&s;ia</HI> were dedicated to <HI>Apollo,</HI> as
<HI>God</HI> of <HI>Phy&s;ick,</HI> and thither the <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI>
&s;ent all tho&s;e who laboured under chronical
Di&s;tempers, of which <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> and <HI>Diet,</HI>
limited and managed according to the Na|ture
of the Ca&s;e, made up all the Cure. By
Degrees it &s;pread over all the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> and
<HI>Southern</HI> Countries, and at la&s;t had &s;o gene|ral
an Approbation, as to be univer&s;ally
received all the World over, where Health
was regarded, or the Cure of Di&s;tempers
&s;tudied. Such has been the original Ri&s;e,
Reception, and Approbation of <HI>Exerci&s;e,</HI> as
is evident from antient Hi&s;tory and univer|&s;al
Tradition. Whoever will con&s;ult <HI>Le
Clerc,</HI> will be abundantly &s;atisfied in this
Matter.</P>

&sect;. III. THE <HI>Romans</HI> (as wi&s;e and brave a
People as ever was formed upon the Foot of
mere Nature) received it with all their other
<HI>Arts</HI> from the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and thought it &s;o
nece&s;&s;ary, tho' in a much warmer Climate,
than ours of <HI>England,</HI> that they founded a
great Part of the Cure of Di&s;tempers, as well
as the pre&s;ervative Means of Health, upon it,
in its various Degrees and Kinds. Tho&s;e
who are curious may find all the Learning
of the Antients, collected to entertain them
on this Subject, with the be&s;t Rea&s;ons and
Philo&s;ophy of the Times; and the Account
of the Origin of new Di&s;ea&s;es among the
<HI>Romans,</HI> by <HI>H. Mercurialis,</HI> in his Trea$$$$
<HI>de Arte Gymna&s;tica,</HI> in which every thing
u&s;eful, ingenious, or that has been invented
for this Purpo&s;e, is brought together. <HI>Sy|denham,</HI>

its Prai&s;es, as one of the mo&s;t &s;overeign Re|medies
hitherto known; and mentions &s;eve|ral
In&s;tances of its wonderful Succe&s;s, and
of its conquering the &s;everal Effects of <HI>Ner|vous</HI>
Di&s;tempers by long and con&s;tant Jour|nies

has done what he could, to en|courage

di&s;puted. As to my own Experience, I
never &s;aw any thing done to the Purpo&s;e,
in Nervous Ca&s;es, or with a Succe&s;s com|plete,
and &s;ub&s;i&s;ting for any long time with|out
the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the&s;e two, <HI>Diet</HI> and
<HI>Exerci&s;e.</HI> I have even found the Nece&s;&s;ity
of adding to the&s;e, in &s;ome Ca&s;es, to make
the Recovery durable and &s;olid, Change of
a thicker Air and of a colder Climate, to
that of a <HI>warmer Sun</HI> and <HI>purer</HI> Air; which
have &s;eldom ever failed, when any thing
would &s;ucceed. But that not being in every
one's Power, they mu&s;t be contented with
u&s;ing the Means they can find within their
Reach. The Benefit and ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity
of a pure, fragrant, fre&s;h Air, and the Balm,
Nitre, or Acid of it, both to Health and
Life, are demon&s;trably proved from the Ex|periments
of Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hales,</HI>
and Dr. <HI>Bryan Robin&s;on,</HI> both in the Vege|table
and Animal Kingdom.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. THO' Experience, which extreme|ly
confirms the Benefit of this Remedy, is
the only &s;olid Foundation to go upon, in
the Cure of Di&s;tempers, yet the Rea&s;on of
the thing &s;peaks &s;o loudly, that it cannot
<PB N="178" REF="214">
but be hearken'd to by every rea&s;onable
Per&s;on. As <HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>proper Medicines,</HI> in
due Time, will certainly rectify the <HI>Juices,</HI>
&s;o Labour and Exerci&s;e will mo&s;t infallibly
&s;trengthen the Solids, by promoting and
continuing their con&s;tant Action and Mo|tions.
It is much like the con&s;tant Buckling
of Hair, (I mean as to its Vertue and Effi|cacy,
however different the <HI>Mechanicks</HI> of
the&s;e Effects may be) or keeping it for &s;ome
time fixed in a certain Po&s;ition, to give the
internal Parts new <HI>Contacts</HI> and <HI>Cohe&s;ions,</HI>
and to confirm and &s;ettle them in the&s;e,
which makes them retain the Form and Fi|gure
we de&s;ign. 'Tis true, it is very hard,
if not impo&s;&s;ible to give a &s;trong and la&s;ting
Union and Cohe&s;ion to the weak, disjoined,
and di&s;continued <HI>Fibres</HI> of People of weak
and relaxed Solids; but <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> con&s;tantly
continued does this (and will do it always)
as much as the Nature of Things will admit
of. There is an <HI>innate</HI> Power of <HI>Contrac|tion,</HI>
a <HI>Spring</HI> and <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> in all Animal
Solids, as being contrived and de&s;igned a$
In&s;truments of Action and Motion; by Ac|tion
and Motion only, this innate Power i$
nouri&s;hed, pre&s;erved, increa&s;ed, and reco|vered.
And on the contrary, without them
it grows languid, feeble, and weak. No$
only is the Circulation promoted, the Pe$|&s;piration
and all the other Secretions for
warded by <HI>Exerci&s;e;</HI> but by the <HI>Mu&s;cul$</HI>
<PB N="179" REF="215">
Actions, the Blood and Juices are kept in a
due State of Fluidity, their Vi&s;cidity broken
and di&s;&s;olved, and all Ob&s;tructions hindered
or removed. There &s;eems likewi&s;e, as it
were, new Particles to be forced by this
Action, into the Inter&s;tices and Ruptures of
the Solids, to knit and &s;older them, and re|cover
their lo&s;t Union, Cohe&s;ion, and Spring:
So that <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> &s;eems the only, at lea&s;t,
the &s;overeign Remedy, in relaxed and
weakened Solids. And as a low, light, and
temperate Diet is nece&s;&s;ary, and the be&s;t
means of diluting and &s;weetening the Juices:
and as at the &s;ame Time, it &s;ometimes
weakens and relaxes the Solids, &s;o <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI>
is more eminently u&s;eful in that Ca&s;e, to
keep up the due Force and Strength of the
<HI>Fibres,</HI> el&s;e the Patient can never receive the
full Benefit of &s;uch a <HI>Diet.</HI> All tho&s;e in a
<HI>low Diet,</HI> who have long pre&s;erved them|&s;elves
in any Degree of Force and Spirits,
have been con&s;tantly great Followers of Exer|ci&s;e,
without which, even their <HI>low Diet</HI> would
not have been &s;o beneficial, e&s;pecially after
$he <HI>Meridian</HI> of Life, when there is little
Hopes of an <HI>adventitious Force.</HI> And one
Rea&s;on why <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>Hy&s;terical</HI>
$er&s;ons relap&s;e &s;o frequently, after having
$een &s;o wonderfully recovered by the Force
$f <HI>Diet, Exerci&s;e,</HI> and Change of Air, is,
$ecau&s;e they either intermit their <HI>Regimen of
Diet,</HI> their <HI>Exerci&s;e,</HI> or perhaps both: and
<PB N="180" REF="216">
therefore he who, under <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders
and Complaints, would continue tolerably
well after he is got better, mu&s;t continue
both his <HI>Regimen of Diet,</HI> and his <HI>Exerci&s;e,</HI>
in &s;ome certain Degree ever after. It is
true, <HI>Diet</HI> will do infinitely more than Ex|erci&s;e,
and have more la&s;ting Effects, but
both &s;hould be joined.</P>
<P>&sect; V. It is of no great Con&s;equence of
what Sort or Kind the <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> be, provided
it be but <HI>Bodily Exerci&s;e</HI> and Action; cer|tainly
<HI>riding</HI> on Hor&s;e-back is the be&s;t of all,
becau&s;e of the almo&s;t erect Po&s;ture, the
le&s;&s;er Wearine&s;s, and the more univer&s;al
and natural Motion of all the Organs, with
the con&s;tant Change of Air: and that the lower
Regions of the Body, and the alimentary
In&s;truments and <HI>Hypochondres</HI> are thereby
mo&s;t &s;haken and exerci&s;ed. Next to that, is
riding in a <HI>Chai&s;e</HI> or <HI>Chariot. Walking,</HI> tho'
it will an&s;wer the &s;ame End and Purpo&s;e as
well as any, and may be more readily and
ea&s;ily u&s;ed, becau&s;e it may be equally fol|lowed
within Doors and without, in Winter
as well as Summer, yet it is more laborious
and tire&s;ome. Next to the&s;e are the active
Games and Sports, &s;uch as <HI>Hunting, Shoot|ing,
Bowls, Billiards, Shuttle-cock,</HI> and the
like. I have known tho&s;e who have exer|ci&s;ed
them&s;elves by &s;trongly working their
Arms backward and forward; and &s;ome
<PB N="181" REF="217">
have u&s;ed Weights for that Purpo&s;e, &s;wing|ing
and &s;haking them in their Hands. And
&s;ome have done it with a <HI>Cane,</HI> rubbing
it &s;trongly over the whole Mu&s;cles of the
Body and Limbs. The <HI>Fle&s;h-Bru&s;h</HI> has
&s;upplied tho&s;e who could not afford, or
were not able to u&s;e any other Kind of
<HI>Exerci&s;e.</HI> But certainly the be&s;t of all is,
where <HI>Amu&s;ement</HI> or <HI>Entertainment</HI> of the
Mind is joined with Bodily Labour, and con|&s;tant
Change of Air, as in <HI>Hunting, Bowls,
Billiards,</HI> and the like, and riding Journies
about Bu&s;ine&s;s: For the Entertainment of
the Mind, and keeping it agreeably diverted
from reflecting on its Misfortunes or Mi&s;ery,
makes Exerci&s;e infinitely more beneficial, as
<HI>Thoughtfulne&s;s, Anxiety,</HI> and <HI>Concern</HI> render
it quite u&s;ele&s;s.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. IT is upon this Account that I
would earne&s;tly recommend to all tho&s;e af|flicted
with <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers, always to
have &s;ome innocent entertaining <HI>Amu&s;ement</HI>
to employ them&s;elves in, for the Re&s;t
of the Day, after they have employed a
&s;ufficient time upon <HI>Exerci&s;e,</HI> towards the
Evening, to prepare them for their Night's
quiet Re&s;t. It &s;eems to me ab&s;olutely im|po&s;&s;ible,
without &s;uch a Help, to keep the
Mind ea&s;y, and prevent its wearing out the
Body, as the Sword does the Scabbard; it
is no matter what it is, provided it be but a
<PB N="182" REF="218">
<HI>Hobby-Hor&s;e,</HI> and an Amu&s;ement, and &s;top
the Current of Reflexion and inten&s;e Think|ing,
which Per&s;ons of weak Nerves are
apte&s;t to run into. The common Divi&s;ion
of Mankind, into <HI>Quick Thinkers, Slow
Thinkers,</HI> and <HI>No Thinkers,</HI> is not without
Foundation in Nature and true Philo&s;ophy.
Per&s;ons of &s;lender and weak Nerves are ge|nerally
of the fir&s;t Cla&s;s: the Activity, Mo|bility,
and Delicacy of their intellectual Or|gans
make them &s;o, and thereby weakens
and relaxes the <HI>Material Organs</HI> of the in|tellectual
Faculties; and therefore ingenious
Flattering, ea&s;y and agreeable Amu&s;ements,
and Intervals of No-thinking and <HI>Swi&s;s-Me|ditation,</HI>
(as it is maliciou&s;ly called) is as
nece&s;&s;ary for &s;uch, as Sleep to the Weary, or
Meat to the Hungry, el&s;e the Spring will
break, and the Sword wear out the Scabbard.
<HI>Study</HI> of difficult and intricate Matters will
infallibly do Hurt. <HI>Reading</HI> mu&s;t be light,
entertaining, and diverting, as well as Food.
<HI>Conver&s;ation</HI> mu&s;t be ea&s;y and agreeable,
without Di&s;putes or Contradiction. The
<HI>Diver&s;ion</HI> innocent and inexpen&s;ive, el&s;e the
Remor&s;e and Reflexion afterwards will do
infinitely more Prejudice than the pre&s;ent
<HI>Amu&s;ement</HI> can recompen&s;e; and it mu&s;t
end at &s;ea&s;onable Hours, without leaving a
<HI>Hurry</HI> and <HI>Fatigue</HI> upon the Spirits of the
Patient. To determine ab&s;olutely the Kinds
and Quantities of the <HI>Exerci&s;e, Amu&s;ement,</HI>
<PB N="183" REF="219">
or even <HI>Diet,</HI> or the Times mo&s;t proper for
&s;uch, is impo&s;&s;ible to any but the <HI>Patient</HI>

that as <HI>Nervous Di&s;tempers</HI> and <HI>Old Age</HI> re|duce
Men to the Weakne&s;s, the Tenderne&s;s,
and Delicacy of Children, or very young
Per&s;ons, they mu&s;t be treated, and treat
them&s;elves as &s;uch, 'till Strength and a per|fect
Recovery come, if ever they are &s;o
lucky as to arrive at it, much in the &s;ame
way, as a Child mu&s;t be treated in his <HI>Non|age,</HI>

&s;poil'd, and perhaps all the&s;e together; and
it may be very ju&s;tly affirmed, that no habi|tual
and grievous, or great <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;or|ders,
ever happened to any one who la|boured
not under &s;ome real <HI>Glandular</HI> Di&s;|temper,
either <HI>&s;crophulous</HI> or <HI>&s;corbutical,</HI>
original or acquired. So that in general,
great Nervous Di&s;orders may ju&s;tly and pro|perly
be termed <HI>Glandular.</HI> The Stomach is
often the fir&s;t and principal Organ (or at
lea&s;t by Con&s;ent and Con&s;equence) in the
Fault: Either it is too thin and weak by
Nature, or the inner <HI>villous</HI> Membrane is
worn off by Luxury, &s;o that it cannot con|tract
clo&s;e enough to embrace the Food; or
it is become too &s;oft, flabby, and relaxed,
&s;o that it cannot, with &s;ufficient Spring,
&s;queeze its Contents; or its <HI>Glands</HI> are grow|ing
<HI>&s;chirrous, hard,</HI> and <HI>knotted,</HI> &s;o that its
Action is weak and languid, and interrupted,
or <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> there may actually be a di&s;covera|ble
<HI>Impo&s;thume, Schirro&s;ity,</HI> or <HI>Cancer</HI> al|ready
extant in it. And hence the Nece&s;|&s;ity
of frequent, but gentle Vomits (at lea&s;t
in all the&s;e Ca&s;es but the la&s;t) to empty
the&s;e weak <HI>Glands,</HI> when full of indige&s;ted
<HI>Flegm, Wind,</HI> or <HI>Choler,</HI> in &s;uch <HI>Nervous</HI>
Ca&s;es, and a thin, light, cool, and balmy
<HI>Diet,</HI> proportioned to the Weakne&s;s and In|firmities
of the Stomach and Solids (to give
it the lea&s;t Labour, and mo&s;t Re&s;t po&s;&s;ible,
as we cure broken Bones, by u&s;ing them

more Infection in them all, without Excep|tion.</P>
<P>&sect; II. A VITIOUS <HI>Liver</HI> &s;eems to be one of
the primary and immediate Cau&s;es of <HI>Nervous</HI>
Di&s;tempers. I never once in my Life &s;aw
an <HI>Hy&s;teric</HI> or <HI>Hypochondriac</HI> Ca&s;e, of a deep
Nature, or extreme Degree, in &s;trong Per|&s;ons
e&s;pecially, where the <HI>Liver,</HI> and it's
Appendages were not eminently faulty,
either by a praeternatural <HI>Size, Tumefaction,
Ob&s;truction,</HI> or <HI>Schirro&s;ity;</HI> and when by
<HI>ponderous,</HI> alterative, active Medicines, join'd
with a cool thin Diet, the Ob&s;tructions have
been opened, the <HI>Gall Bladder</HI> and <HI>Porus
Biliarius</HI> pervious, then, either <HI>green, yellow,</HI>
or <HI>black Choler</HI> has poured out abundantly
into the Stomach. The <HI>Liver</HI> is the <HI>Organ</HI>
de&s;igned by Nature (or, at lea&s;t, Nature
makes U&s;e of it) to &s;uck out, draw off, and
convey into the common <HI>Shore</HI> of the Body
(the <HI>Guts</HI>) all the Poi&s;on, Malignity, and
de&s;tructive Part of high rank Foods, and too
great a Quantity of rich Liquors, taken into
the Habit. This wi&s;e and bountiful Con|trivance
of Nature becomes an <HI>Antidote,</HI> or
is a Receptacle (for &s;ome time) for the de|&s;tructive
Effects of <HI>Luxury</HI> and <HI>Intemperance.</HI>
And hence it comes to pa&s;s that gluttonous
and voluptuous Animals, whether <HI>Brutal</HI> or
<HI>Rational,</HI> have always overgrown <HI>Livers,</HI>
<PB N="186" REF="222">
and accordingly among the <HI>Romans,</HI> tho&s;e
Animals who&s;e <HI>Livers</HI> were delicious, had
their whole Entrails almo&s;t turned into <HI>Liver,</HI>
by unnaturally cramming them with high
and generous Foods; and no plentiful and
<HI>full Feeder</HI> was ever opened, but he was
found with &s;ome gro&s;s Fault in his <HI>Liver&punc;</HI>
It has indeed a noble and indi&s;pen&s;ible U&s;e
in all Animals (the human more e&s;pecially)
who live on Animal Foods and fermented
Liquors, even beyond any Organ of the
Body, next to the <HI>Heart, Brain,</HI> and <HI>Lungs:</HI>
for it not only &s;ucks out all the Venom, as
it were, of the whole Ma&s;s of Blood, and
carries it into the Guts (<HI>the common Shore,</HI>
to be thence carried out of the Habit in
Part) but there al&s;o the <HI>Bile,</HI> by its natural
Acrimony and Stimulation, is the great
Spring and Cau&s;e of the <HI>Peri&s;taltic</HI> Motion:
(that Function &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Dige&s;tion and
throwing off the Redundancy and Fecu|lence);
be&s;ides that it unites, by its <HI>&s;oapy</HI>
Nature, the various Particles of which the
<HI>Chile</HI> is compounded, and renders it a <HI>&s;imilar</HI>
and <HI>uniform</HI> Fluid: and by its Bitterne&s;s, and
this <HI>Saponaceous</HI> Quality, it clean&s;es and
&s;cowers the Mouths of the &s;mall and delicate
<HI>Lacteal Tubes,</HI> from their Ob&s;tructions and
Filth. But as all good Things, perverted
and abu&s;ed, have Pains and Puni&s;hments an|nexed
to them, in Proportion to their Ad|vantages
and Benefits, &s;o the <HI>Liver,</HI> when
<PB N="187" REF="223">
praeternaturally large, tumified, ob&s;tructed,
or <HI>&s;chirrous,</HI> becomes the Cau&s;e of the mo&s;t
terrible and frightful Mi&s;eries incident to
human Nature; from hence generally and
chiefly &s;pring all our horrible and dire <HI>Hy|&s;terics</HI>
and <HI>Hypochondriacs,</HI> our <HI>Epilep&s;ies,
Apoplexies,</HI> and our <HI>Manias,</HI> our <HI>Cholicks,

or make <HI>Choler (Adu&s;t, Black, Yellow,</HI> or
<HI>Green</HI>) an innocent, acid, active Liquor only
(as it is in the Animals that live only on
Vegetables) it would infallibly cure the&s;e
Di&s;orders; but I believe there is none, nor
can be any &s;uch Art or Medicine, con&s;ider|ing
the e&s;tabli&s;hed Laws of Nature, and
tho&s;e of the <HI>Animal Oeconomy:</HI> but the pon|derous
Remedies which open Ob&s;tructions
(&s;uch as Preparations of <HI>Antimony</HI> and <HI>Mer|cury</HI>)
gentle <HI>Emeticks,</HI> which pump up the
peccant Humour as it flows (for <HI>Catharticks</HI>
do little or nothing in &s;uch Ca&s;es, it being
impo&s;&s;ible to carry forcibly vitiated <HI>Choler</HI>
&s;o great a Length without Violence to Na|ture,
be&s;ides that all Kind of Purges pa&s;s
through this gro&s;s Fluid, when vitiated, and
leave it much as they found it) and a thin,
mild Diet, that cuts off the Sources of the
Evil. What is here &s;aid of the <HI>Liver,</HI> may
be readily applied to the <HI>Spleen,</HI> in a certain
Degree, and therefore 'tis needle&s;s to add
any more of either.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="224">
&sect; III. THE <HI>Glands</HI> of the <HI>Me&s;entery,</HI> or
of the <HI>Guts,</HI> being knotted or ob&s;tructed, are
le&s;s obvious by any other Symptoms, than
the&s;e of a general <HI>Weakne&s;s, Thinne&s;s</HI> of
Habit, a Tendence to <HI>Hectical</HI> Heats after
Meals, and e&s;pecially an Inappetence and
Weakne&s;s of Dige&s;tion, Faintings, cold
Sweats, Lowne&s;s of Spirits, and Oppre&s;&s;ions,
and the other <HI>Nervous</HI> Complaints to be de|&s;cribed,
tho&s;e particularly of thin and <HI>vale|tudinary</HI>
Per&s;ons. And tho&s;e who continue
weak, thin, and valetudinary, after Youth|hood
is over, are much to be &s;u&s;pected of
<HI>knotted Glands</HI> in the <HI>Me&s;entery,</HI> which ob|&s;truct
and hinder the free and ea&s;y Pa&s;&s;age of
the <HI>Chyle</HI> thro' the <HI>Lacteals,</HI> who&s;e common
<HI>Ba&s;on</HI> is in, and mo&s;t general Cour&s;e is thro'
that <HI>Membrane;</HI> or of <HI>knotted Guts,</HI> and
their ob&s;tructed Valves, which hinder the
free Play of the <HI>Peri&s;taltick</HI> Motion, &s;o ne|ce&s;&s;ary
towards the Progre&s;s of the Dige&s;tion,
and the Expul&s;ion of the Feculence; and all
the&s;e more immediate Cau&s;es of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;|tempers
&s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity, Expedience,
and Benefit of ponderous Remedies, in the
Beginning of a Cure: gentle Evacuations
upwards or downwards, in the Proce&s;s; and
mild A&s;tringents and Strengtheners to fini&s;h
it; and an univer&s;al thin and low Diet in the
whole Progre&s;s, and for future Pre&s;ervation.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="225">
&sect; IV. IT is very po&s;&s;ible, neither the
<HI>ponderous</HI> Remedies, nor the Evacuations
may di&s;&s;olve, or even much &s;often knotted,
<HI>&s;chirrous,</HI> or ob&s;tructed <HI>Glands</HI> in any Part
of the Habit; but a cool, thin, &s;oft, <HI>bal|&s;amick
Diet</HI> will always make the Juices cir|culate
ea&s;y, and without Rubs and Re&s;i&s;t|ance;
as a clear, thin, equable Stream of
running Water will glide gently and calmly
by the Sides of <HI>implanted I&s;lands:</HI> and the&s;e
<HI>Knots</HI> and <HI>Tubercles</HI> may thereby lie as ea&s;ily
and quietly in the Body, as the Nails on our
Fingers and Toes, or as Bones &s;urrounded
with Mu&s;cles; and we know &s;weet thin
Blood will make its way into the Circula|tion,
through the lateral Branches, when the
Trunk of the Artery is cut through: and
that is all <HI>Art</HI> can do, or the Laws of the
Animal <HI>Oeconomy</HI> will admit. And it is
highly probable, when any one of the&s;e
more immediate Cau&s;es of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders
happen, they are all together in greater or
le&s;&s;er Degrees. Cutaneous Di&s;orders al&s;o,
&s;uch as the <HI>Lepro&s;y, Elephantia&s;is, Impetigo,
Itch, Scurvy,</HI> and <HI>Eri&s;ipelas,</HI> have a mo&s;t
powerful Influence in producing tho&s;e
violent, inveterate, and high, <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;|orders.
But the Rea&s;on of the violent <HI>Fits</HI>
under them is, that the <HI>Glands</HI> and great
<HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> are loaded more than ordinary by
<HI>Debauches, high Diet,</HI> and too great Fulne&s;s:
<PB N="190" REF="226">
&s;o that the Circulation is thereby hindered and
&s;top'd, and this makes the&s;e cutaneous Foul|ne&s;&s;es
recoil inwards, for Want of due Force
and Freedom in the Circulation, to pre&s;s
them out, where they are &s;afe&s;t; and none
will be perfectly and &s;afely cured under
them, but by a long Cour&s;e of the <HI>ponderous</HI>
Medicines, and a thin, cool, &s;oft Diet.</P>
<P>&sect; V. IT is al&s;o po&s;&s;ible, that none of all
the&s;e mentioned immediate Cau&s;es may be
the true one, and yet <HI>Lowne&s;s of Spirits,</HI>
Sickne&s;s, and even <HI>Fits, Fainting,</HI> and <HI>Con|vul&s;ions</HI>
may happen: and when there may
be none of the&s;e mentioned great Cau&s;es, by
particular and &s;pecial Symptoms to be &s;u&s;|pected
or ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed, a <HI>Polypus</HI> in the
Heart, or <HI>Great Artery,</HI> or &s;ome praeterna|tural
Formation, <HI>Excre&s;cence,</HI> or <HI>Mal-Forma|tion,</HI>
in &s;ome nece&s;&s;ary Organ, may be the
Cau&s;e of them; or <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> the Juices may be
&s;o thick, <HI>vi&s;cid,</HI> and <HI>glewy,</HI> as may interrupt
the Circulation, and the ea&s;y Performance
of the Animal Functions. But as &s;uch Ca&s;es
are more <HI>rare,</HI> they do not &s;o immediately
come under &s;uch general Directions as my
De&s;ign mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily confine me to, and
can therefore receive here no particular Con|&s;ideration.
It is, in my Opinion, that it is
here as in the great <HI>Venereal</HI> Ca&s;es, where,
if the <HI>Grand Remedy</HI> be &s;ufficiently and
duely pur&s;ued, there will be little or no
<PB N="191" REF="227">
need of Application to particular and <HI>Topical</HI>
Complaints, which will drop off, and evani&s;h
of them&s;elves, as &s;triking at, and cutting
the Root of a Tree, will render the lopping
of the Branches u&s;ele&s;s. In all <HI>Chronical,
Cachectical,</HI> and ob&s;tinate Ca&s;es, I can allow
of, and could never learn or di&s;cover, but
<HI>two</HI> univer&s;al, certain, and natural <HI>Antidotes,
Remedies,</HI> or <HI>Methods of Cure, viz.</HI> the pon|derous
and Mineral Medicines (the chief of
which are <HI>Mercury, Antimony,</HI> and <HI>Steel,</HI>
with Evacuations) and <HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Regimen</HI>
(the &s;econdary A&s;&s;i&s;tants of which are <HI>Air</HI>
and <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI>) and both skilfully joined to|gether,
and duty per&s;i&s;ted in, is the highe&s;t
Pitch <HI>Art</HI> can, in my Judgment, ari&s;e to,
under the pre&s;ent Laws of Nature, and of
the <HI>Animal Oeconomy:</HI> the Application, tho'
to particular Ca&s;es and Con&s;titutions, will
require the Skill, Addre&s;s, and Attention of

<P>&sect; I. THE Title of this Chapter is &s;o
large a Field, that it would re|quire
a <HI>Volume</HI> of it&s;elf, to de|tail
every thing that may be &s;aid, even with
Advantage to the &s;uffering Patient on this

Patient in every Particular, but to give a
general <HI>Scheme</HI> of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders, founded
upon Rea&s;on, Philo&s;ophy, and Experience;
and it being both ab&s;urd and even impo&s;&s;ible

to particular Ca&s;es, which I mu&s;t &s;up|po&s;e
applicable only to &s;uch individual
Ca&s;es by the <HI>Phy&s;ician</HI> in ordinary.</P>
<P>&sect; II. ALL the Symptoms and Di&s;orders of
a <HI>&s;plenetick</HI> Per&s;on will naturally and readily
be deduced from too thick and glewy or &s;harp
Juices, &s;ome great Bowel &s;poil'd, or &s;trong
Ob&s;tructions form'd, and the regorging Fluids
thereby brought on, &s;truggling and labour|ing

feeble, and unela&s;tick Solids. Perfect Health,
free Spirits, Ea&s;e, and Chearfulne&s;s con&s;i&s;t

of the <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> in a full
<HI>Circulation,</HI> free <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI> and <HI>regular
Secretions.</HI> When by the mentioned Cir|cum&s;tances,
all the&s;e become forced, labour'd,
and unea&s;y, the Symptoms we commonly
a&s;cribe to the <HI>Spleen,</HI> mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily ari&s;e:
even tho' they be attended with no really
form'd Di&s;ea&s;e, or no noble Organ entirely
&s;poil'd; and the true Rea&s;on of the Multi|plicity,
Variety, and Incon&s;tancy of the&s;e
Symptoms, is the va&s;t Multitude of the Com|binations
po&s;&s;ible, of the&s;e natural F$$|ctions,
every one of which makes a new
<HI>Symptom,</HI> and who&s;e uniform, equable Per|formance
is &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to Health.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="230">
&sect; III. THE <HI>Spleen</HI> or <HI>Vapours,</HI> as the
Word is u&s;ed in <HI>England,</HI> is of &s;o general
and loo&s;e a Signification, that it is a common
Subterfuge for meer Ignorance of the Na|ture
of Di&s;tempers. All <HI>Lowne&s;s of Spirits,
Swelling of the Stomach, frequent Eructation,
Noi&s;e in the Bowels or Ears, frequent Yawn|ing,
Inappetency, Re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s, Inquietude,
Fidgeting, Anxiety, Peevi&s;hne&s;s, Di&s;content,
Melancholy, Grief, Vexation, Ill-Humour,
Incon&s;tancy, lethargick</HI> or <HI>watchful Di&s;orders,</HI>
in &s;hort, every Symptom, not already cla&s;&s;ed
under &s;ome particular limited Di&s;temper, is
called by the general Name of <HI>Spleen</HI> and
<HI>Vapours:</HI> of which there are various and
different Symptoms, according to the dif|ferent
Con&s;titutions, Tempers of Mind, and
common Di&s;ea&s;es, Per&s;ons &s;ubject to &s;uch
Symptoms labour under. In general, <HI>Vapours</HI>
(as it is a Di&s;temper &s;ubject to the Rules of
<HI>Art</HI>) are bad, &s;harp, thick, and vi&s;cid Juices,
attended with weak and relaxed <HI>Nerves, Fi|bres,</HI>
or <HI>Solids:</HI> Where-ever the&s;e mentioned
Symptoms are, in any eminent Degree, the&s;e
<HI>Conditions</HI> mu&s;t be. And on the other
Hand, where-ever the&s;e <HI>Conditions</HI> are, &s;ome
more or fewer of the&s;e mentioned Symptoms
mu&s;t be, according to the Degree of the&s;e
Conditions. <HI>Vapours</HI> therefore are either
<HI>original</HI> and &s;imple, or not attended with
any other real Di&s;ea&s;e or Malady, as yet appa|rent
<PB N="195" REF="231">
(except the Conditions or Cau&s;es men|tioned)
or <HI>Symptomatick,</HI> being cau&s;ed or
produced by &s;ome other real determined Di&s;|temper,
which is attended with, or pro|duces
tho&s;e mentioned Conditions, of which
Di&s;temper this Kind of <HI>Vapours</HI> is only a
<HI>Symptom</HI> or Effect, and in which they al|ways
terminate in their la&s;t Stage or Degree.
From whence it is pretty evident, that this
la&s;t Kind of Vapours can never be cured,
unle&s;s the original Di&s;temper, on which they
depend, be cured, when it is become ma|nife&s;t.
It is well known, that every bodily
Di&s;temper is attended with, or produces
Lowne&s;s of Spirits, and &s;ome others of the
<HI>Symptoms</HI> I have mentioned. When the Di&s;|temper
is removed, the&s;e Symptoms gradu|ally
vani&s;h, and <HI>Health</HI> and <HI>Freedom of Spi|rits</HI>
return: So that my pre&s;ent Affair is not
with the&s;e <HI>Symptomatick Vapours,</HI> unle&s;s they
$word$ too long after the original Di&s;temper
$word$ $$moved, and then they are to be treated
$word$ &s;ame manner with the&s;e genuine, $word$
and original <HI>Vapours,</HI> whereof I am
treating.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. To enumerate all the almo&s;t in|finite
Symptoms, Degrees, and Kinds of
<HI>Vapours</HI> is impo&s;&s;ible, and perhaps very little
to the Purpo&s;e. In general, when the
Symptoms are <HI>many, various, changeable,</HI>
&s;hifting from one Place to another, and imi|tating
<PB N="196" REF="232">
the <HI>Symptoms</HI> of almo&s;t every other
Di&s;temper de&s;cribed, if they are attended
with no other apparent, real, determined ori|ginal
Di&s;temper (though they be generally
the Beginnings of a real Di&s;temper, and, if
neglected, terminating in one always.) Then
they may be properly called <HI>Vapours;</HI> for
Di&s;tinction's Sake, I will divide them into
three Degrees, though the Reader is neither
here to expect Accuracy nor Certainty, that
may be depended upon, in &s;uch a <HI>Proteus|like</HI>
Di&s;temper, becau&s;e &s;ome of the Symp|toms
of what I call the <HI>&s;econd Degree,</HI> may
happen in the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> and &s;o on the contrary;
and though in general they grow and ri&s;e
in their <HI>Degrees,</HI> as naturally and gradually
as Plants or Vegetables do, yet we are not
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of proper Names and Mea&s;ures for
the&s;e Degrees, any more than we are of the
Degrees of Heat that cau&s;e Flame or Light,
it being for Brevity's Sake that I chiefly ma$$
the Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. THE <HI>fir&s;t Degree,</HI> which $span$
to be called <HI>Vapours</HI> (if that Name be proper
at all) is when the Cau&s;e and Di&s;order is
chiefly confined to the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Bowels,</HI>
or the <HI>Alimentary Ducts,</HI> and the Blood and
Juices are in a pretty tolerable Condition,
but the Solids &s;omewhat relaxed, loo&s;e, and
flabby: the <HI>Alimentary Tubes</HI> being the fir&s;t
&s;en&s;ible Sufferers in all Bodily Maladies
<PB N="197" REF="233">
what&s;oever. The Symptoms then, be&s;ides
Lowne&s;s of Spirits, are <HI>Wind, Belching,
Yawning, Heart-burning, Croaking of the
Bowels</HI> (like the Noi&s;e of <HI>Frogs</HI>) a <HI>Pain</HI> in
the <HI>Pit of the Stomach</HI> (which is &s;ometimes
mi&s;taken for a Lung Ca&s;e, e&s;pecially if at|tended
with <HI>Shortne&s;s of Breath,</HI> and a tick|ling
Cough, from a Wind in the Cavity
pre&s;&s;ing on the Diaphragm, and thereby
pre&s;&s;ing on the <HI>Lungs,</HI> which is common,
and goes very ju&s;tly by the Name of an
<HI>Hy&s;terick,</HI> or <HI>Nervous</HI> Cough) and &s;ome|times
there is an <HI>Inflation,</HI> and an actual vi|&s;ible
Swelling, to a very con&s;iderable Big|ne&s;s,

of them, and a great many more; but a
Tendency to <HI>Spitting, Ptyali&s;m,</HI> or a Di&s;|charge

Throat, &s;eldom fails to attend all the <HI>Sym|ptoms</HI>

equal Time to fill, and di&s;charge the turgid

the general Cau&s;e of all <HI>Periods</HI> in Di&s;ea&s;es.

People. I only &s;ugge&s;t the&s;e Things to awaken
the Attention of others, and &s;hew the Uni|formity
of Nature in all Things.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> Stage of this Di&s;tem|per
is attended with all the&s;e Symptoms, in
a much higher and more eminent Degree,
and &s;ome new ones, which were not felt,
and con&s;equently not de&s;cribed under the
<HI>fir&s;t</HI> Stage: &s;uch as are in&s;tead of Lowne&s;s
of Spirits: a deep and fixed <HI>Melancholy, wan|dering</HI>
and <HI>delu&s;ory Images</HI> on the Brain, and
<HI>In&s;tability</HI> and <HI>Un&s;ettledne&s;s</HI> in all the intel|lectual
Operations, <HI>Lo&s;s of Memory, De&s;pon|dency,
Horror</HI> and <HI>De&s;pair,</HI> a <HI>Vertigo, Gid|dine&s;s</HI>
or <HI>Staggering, Vomittings</HI> of <HI>Yellow,
Green,</HI> or <HI>Black Choler:</HI> &s;ometimes unac|countable
Fits of <HI>Laughing,</HI> apparent <HI>Joy,
Leaping</HI> and <HI>Dancing;</HI> at other Times, of
<HI>Crying, Grief,</HI> and <HI>Angui&s;h;</HI> and the&s;e ge|nerally
terminate in <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> or <HI>Hy&s;|terical
Fits</HI> (I mean <HI>Convul&s;ive</HI> ones) and
<HI>Faintings,</HI> which leave a Drow&s;ine&s;s, <HI>Le|thargy,</HI>
and extreme Lowne&s;s of Spirits for &s;ome
Time afterwards. Perhaps the <HI>Fits</HI> return often,
<PB N="200" REF="236">
if they be weak and partial ones; or if they
are &s;trong and &s;evere, their Intervals are
longer: The State of the Blood is generally
vi&s;cid (if the Symptoms are not occa&s;ioned
by Accident, or &s;poil'd Bowels) with all the
Con&s;equences which I remarked when I
&s;poke of what I called the &s;econd State of
that Fluid. I think this <HI>&s;econd</HI> Degree of
<HI>Vapours</HI> may always be denominated from
<HI>Fits, Convul&s;ions,</HI> or violent <HI>Paroxy&s;ms</HI> of
the Kind mentioned: and from the antece|dent
or &s;ub&s;equent <HI>Bilious,</HI> Vomitings that
attend &s;uch; and indeed when they are come
to this Degree, there is generally a beginning
Ob&s;truction, or &s;poiling of &s;ome of the great
Bowels, &s;uch as the <HI>Liver,</HI> the <HI>Lungs,</HI> the
<HI>Kidnies,</HI> the <HI>Me&s;entery,</HI> the <HI>Cawl,</HI> the <HI>Spleen,</HI>
or &s;ome other Part nece&s;&s;ary towards the
Animal Functions; attending them, and &s;o a
real Di&s;temper immediately follows: of
which, the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Degree I have mentioned
is the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Step, this la&s;t is the <HI>&s;econd:</HI> and
if not cured in either of the&s;e two, by the
Struggling and Efforts of Nature, joined with
<HI>Art;</HI> the <HI>third</HI> State begins, which is gene|rally
&s;ome <HI>mortal</HI> and incurable Di&s;temper,
&s;uch as <HI>Drop&s;y, Black Jaundice, Con&s;ump|tion,
Pal&s;y, Epilep&s;y,</HI> or <HI>Apoplexy, &amp;c.</HI> To
make which more plain, let us con&s;ider the
Tendency of Nature in its whole Progre&s;s,
with this View.</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="237">
&sect; VII. WHEN, by <HI>Food</HI> of <HI>ill</HI> Qualities,
or an immoderate Quantity of even whole|&s;ome
<HI>Food,</HI> the <HI>Humours</HI> are vitiated, the
Structure of the <HI>Animal Machine</HI> is &s;uch,
that Nature (<HI>i. e.</HI> the <HI>Mechani&s;m of the Body</HI>)
is pre&s;ently rouz'd to &s;truggle with all its
Might, to attenuate (or concoct, as we com|monly
&s;ay) the gro&s;s and vitious Humours,
and &s;o bring them to an healthy State (<HI>i. e.</HI>
one agreeable to Nature) and drive out, by
the mo&s;t proper <HI>Outlets</HI> of the Body, what
cannot be reduc'd to that State. This <HI>Struggle</HI>
is the one only proper and real Di&s;ea&s;e of the
Body, ari&s;ing from the Habit (for I &s;ay no|thing
of tho&s;e from external Injuries) the
va&s;t Variety of particular Di&s;ea&s;es, &s;poken of
by <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> being only &s;o many particular
or various <HI>I&s;&s;ues</HI> of this general Struggle of
Nature. The State of the <HI>Fibres</HI> or <HI>Solids</HI> of
the Body in Strength and Firmne&s;s, at the
Beginning, is the Foundation of the grand
Divi&s;ion of Di&s;ea&s;es into <HI>acute</HI> and <HI>chronical:</HI>
But, Strength being a relative Thing, it is
impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ettle preci&s;ely the Bounds of
the&s;e two <HI>Cla&s;&s;es.</HI> When the Conflict it&s;elf
is very <HI>hot, brisk</HI> and <HI>eager,</HI> we all agree to
call it a <HI>Fever;</HI> when it is &s;low and languid,
I know no receiv'd Name for it, but the
Name of <HI>Vapours,</HI> or <HI>Nervous Di&s;orders,</HI> (a
Word us'd in a very indi&s;tinct Manner, being
a&s;crib'd to all or each of the Appearances
<PB N="202" REF="238">
that ari&s;e in the Progre&s;s of this &s;lower Con|flict.)
It were not ami&s;s to re&s;train the unde|termin'd
Meaning of this <HI>Word,</HI> to &s;ignify all
the Di&s;orders of Nature under the Conflict
of the Di&s;ea&s;e when the Solids are weak, as
the Name of <HI>Fever</HI> is appropriated to all the
<HI>Symptoms</HI> that appear during the Conflict, in
a &s;trong State of the <HI>Solids.</HI> This &s;uppos'd,
let us next con&s;ider the &s;everal Events of this
<HI>Conflict,</HI> which mu&s;t be either an intire, or a
partial Victory of Nature, or a partial or
total Prevalency of the Di&s;ea&s;e. The Events
are call'd <HI>Cri&s;es,</HI> or Solutions of the Di&s;ea&s;e,
by <HI>Phy&s;icians.</HI> The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Sort is <HI>Health,</HI> the
la&s;t <HI>Death,</HI> the middle ones are call'd <HI>Di&s;|ea&s;es;</HI>
of which again there are many Divi|&s;ions
very different from the two <HI>primary</HI> ones,
to wit, <HI>Vapours</HI> and a <HI>Fever.</HI> For 1<HI>&s;t.</HI> it is
very common for Nature to get an intire
Conque&s;t over the Di&s;ea&s;e, in a few Days,
when the Solids are &s;trong, that is, for the
<HI>Fever</HI> to end by a <HI>Critical</HI> Di&s;charge, &s;uch as
<HI>Sweating,</HI> a <HI>Diur&s;is,</HI> or <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> and the
like; &s;o that there remains nothing but to
recruit the Solids weaken'd in the Struggle.
2<HI>dly.</HI> At other Times when the <HI>Fibres</HI> are
tolerably firm, tho' Nature carries on the
Conflict with Vigour at fir&s;t, to make a quick
End, yet it is &s;ometimes oblig'd to com|pound
with the Di&s;ea&s;e, by giving up a <HI>Pe&s;t</HI>
which was not tenable, that is, to throw the
Di&s;ea&s;e upon &s;ome particular <HI>Organ,</HI> and &s;o
<PB N="203" REF="239">
the <HI>Fever</HI> terminates in a critical <HI>Ab&s;ce&s;s,</HI> &amp;c.
3<HI>dly.</HI> When the Solids are &s;o weak, that
Nature carries on the Struggle but faintly for
a long time, without tending to either of
the&s;e two mention'd <HI>Cri&s;es,</HI> and the morbid
Matter, thro' the Feeblene&s;s of the Conflict,
is never &s;ufficiently broken and divided, or
fitted to be carried out of the Habit, by
either of the two mention'd Ways, the Di&s;|ea&s;e
ends in an univer&s;al Weakne&s;s and
Feeblene&s;s of Nature, a general <HI>Cachexy,</HI> or
a continued bad State of the Juices and re|lax'd
Solids, if not in <HI>Death</HI> it&s;elf; and this
gives Ground for the Di&s;tinction between
<HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Acute Fevers.</HI> But <HI>la&s;tly,</HI> if the
Solids are &s;o weak, and the Fluids &s;o bad,
that the Struggle is but very faint, imperfect,
or &s;carce di&s;cernable, at lea&s;t compared with
the former, the fir&s;t Attempts and Beginnings
of this Struggle produce tho&s;e Symptoms
which are properly call'd <HI>Vapours</HI> of the fir&s;t
Kind: And if proper Means or Remedies be
not u&s;ed in due Time, they may grow higher
and &s;tronger, with many additional Symptoms
of the &s;ame Kind.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. From this Deduction, it is evident,
that <HI>Vapours</HI> are the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Symptoms of a real
chronical Di&s;ea&s;e, which, if neglected, will
terminate in &s;poiling &s;ome of the great Bowels,
and &s;o in putting a Period to Animal Life.
Some may be born with &s;uch a Con&s;titution;
<PB N="204" REF="240">
but if by no Mi&s;management they increa&s;e or
exa&s;perate the&s;e <HI>Symptoms,</HI> Nature may thus
go on to its common Period, as well as an
Animal may with a broken or wa&s;ted Limb:
But neglecting the Means, or fuelling the
Di&s;ea&s;e by a <HI>Mal-Regimen,</HI> it will certainly
terminate &s;ooner or later in tho&s;e real Di&s;|tempers,
which have Names and Determi|nations,
&s;uch as a <HI>Drop&s;y, A&s;thma,</HI> or <HI>Con|&s;umption,</HI>
and &s;o may be attended with the
Symptoms that the&s;e mortal Di&s;tempers are
de&s;cribed by, and at la&s;t end in <HI>Death.</HI> So
that it is needle&s;s to enumerate the <HI>Symptoms</HI>
of this <HI>Stage,</HI> they being commonly known
and de&s;cribed by the <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> that treat of
&s;uch mortal Di&s;tempers, for being irreme|diable,
as they are in <HI>this</HI> Stage; they admit
of nothing but a <HI>palliative</HI> Cure, to make the
Symptoms ea&s;y; which how it is to be done,
I &s;hall &s;hew in the next <HI>Chapter.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Cure of the Symptoms of Vapours
Hy&s;terical and Hypochondriacal Di&s;|orders.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; I. WHAT I have formerly &s;aid
about the general Cure of
<HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers by a <HI>Re|gimen
of Diet, Exerci&s;e,</HI> and the three Cla&s;&s;es
of Medicines mentioned, is not only the
&s;olid Foundation of a &s;ub&s;tantial and la&s;ting
Cure, but is al&s;o the mo&s;t effectual Means
for weakning the Symptoms, and making their
Intervals longer, and without which all the
other Attempts for that Purpo&s;e will be in|effectual,
at lea&s;t procure only temporary
Relief, &s;ince the&s;e Symptoms will return more
frequently, and with greater Violence, as
the State of the Fluids and Solids grow
wor&s;e, which they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily do, under
a Neglect of the&s;e Means, alone &s;ufficient to
e&s;tabli&s;h a &s;olid and perfect Cure. So that
they who would effectually relieve or le&s;&s;en
the Symptoms of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders, have
<PB N="206" REF="242">
nothing more to do, but to accommodate
the&s;e general Directions to particular Con&s;ti|tutions
and Circum&s;tances. But becau&s;e,
while this general Cure is going forward, the
Symptoms may be &s;o <HI>di&s;piriting</HI> and <HI>painful,</HI>
that Life becomes an u&s;ele&s;s Burthen, it is
ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary by all means po&s;&s;ible,
to gain a <HI>Reprieve,</HI> from the&s;e Symptoms, if
not for a long Time, at lea&s;t for as long a
Time as can be, to give Room for the&s;e uni|ver&s;al
Means to operate.</P>
<P>&sect; II. I know not in Nature a more uni|ver&s;al
and effectual Remedy for mo&s;t, if
not all the Symptoms of the&s;e Di&s;orders when
they ri&s;e to any high Degree, than gentle
<HI>Vomits</HI> &s;uited to the Strength and Con&s;titution
of the Patient, not only as they di&s;charge the
<HI>Choler,</HI> or <HI>Bile,</HI> and <HI>Phlegm</HI> from the <HI>Liver</HI>
and <HI>Alimentary Ducts,</HI> but as by their <HI>Succu&s;|&s;ions</HI>
and Action, they open the Ob&s;tructions
of that va&s;t Number of <HI>Glands</HI> &s;ituated in the
inner Side of the&s;e Ducts (which too are
either the Cau&s;e of, or certainly attend mo&s;t
of the violent <HI>Nervous</HI> Symptoms) and pro|mote
the Circulation and Per&s;piration. The&s;e
<HI>Vomits,</HI> in weak Per&s;ons, may be effected by
a Decoction or Tea of <HI>C$rduus, Chamomik
Flowers, Hor&s;e Radi&s;h,</HI> or any bitter or
acrid Plant, or by <HI>Ipecacuanha</HI> or its Tin|cture
alone; but in the &s;tronger Con&s;titutions
nothing is to be depended on without join|ing
<PB N="207" REF="243">
&s;ome Preparation of Antimony. I never
found either in my own Ca&s;e, or my Practice
on others, that I could &s;o quickly and effe|ctually
relieve either violent Paroxy&s;ms of
<HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers, or the other &s;inking
Symptoms attending them, as by &s;uch an
Evacuation; and I have been always forc'd
to repeat it as often as the&s;e Symptoms re|turn'd,
till the Di&s;temper was quite overcome.
I have extremely reliev'd &s;ome, and have
totally cured others by every Morning drink|ing
large Draughts of <HI>Chamomile</HI> Flower
Tea, to throw off the Flegm, and then
drinking <HI>Bath</HI> Waters after the Stomach was
&s;ettled, and pur&s;uing a <HI>Regimen</HI> and <HI>Exer|ci&s;e</HI>
in the Day-time. Tho&s;e who are young
land &s;trong, and to whom the&s;e Symptoms
are not become habitual, and who&s;e Con&s;ti|tution
is yet &s;ound, and not loaded with
gro&s;s Humours, may &s;ometimes get them off
at a le&s;&s;er Expence, as by frequent Do&s;es of
<HI>Hiera Picra, Tincture</HI> of <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> the <HI>Ruffi</HI>
or the <HI>Stomach</HI> Pills, but chiefly the <HI>Pilul.
Gummos cum Aloe-lota,</HI> in equal Quantities,
frequently, if not every Night, repeated, or as
Occa&s;ion requires. I have never found any
great Relief from Bli&s;ters, I&s;&s;ues, or even
Bleeding it&s;elf, in this Ca&s;e, unle&s;s it was in
very full Habits, or when premis'd to a general
Cour&s;e for the Cure, becau&s;e the <HI>Cachexy</HI>
was univer&s;al; much le&s;s is any thing to be
expected from lying a-bed and &s;weating
<PB N="208" REF="244">
(a late celebrated Method in the Cure of
<HI>Vapours</HI>) which I have always found to relax
much more.</P>
<P>&sect; III. RESTLESSNESS, <HI>Inquietude</HI> of
Spirits, and Want of natural <HI>Sleep</HI> is one of
the mo&s;t trouble&s;ome and di&s;piriting Symp|toms
attending this Di&s;temper. When it is
extreme, nothing is to be done without <HI>Lau|danum</HI>
or <HI>Opiates,</HI> but the&s;e ought always to
be blended with &s;ome &s;mall Proportion of
the <HI>Volatile</HI> and <HI>Aromatick</HI> Medicines, which
encrea&s;e their benign, and po&s;&s;ibly may
hinder their de&s;tructive Effects, if they have
any; however Recour&s;e is never to be had
to them, but in extreme Ca&s;es, and when
other Things will not do, becau&s;e of their
<HI>deleterious</HI> Effects on the Solids, which very
po&s;&s;ibly they may relax more and more.
There are &s;ome with whom doubtle&s;&s;ly
<HI>Opiates</HI> agree much better than others; and
they are &s;uch, I think, who&s;e Solids are yet
pretty firm, and where the Fluids are mo&s;t
in Fault, or &s;ome of the great Bowels only
weakened. There are others, to whom they
give a little <HI>do&s;ing</HI> or dead Sleep, yet when
their Force is worn off, they leave a <HI>Lowne&s;s,
Di&s;piritedne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Anxiety,</HI> that even over|balances
the Relief or Quiet they bring; and
they are tho&s;e who are entirely <HI>Cachectick,</HI>
as well as &s;ubject to <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders, &s;uch
I &s;hould per&s;uade to u&s;e <HI>A&s;&s;a-foetida</HI> in Pills,
<PB N="209" REF="245">
Morning and Night, or the <HI>Gum Pills</HI> of the
<HI>London</HI> or <HI>Edinburgh</HI> Di&s;pen&s;atory (both
which are excellent Medicines for this Pur|po&s;e)
they having often all the good Ef|fects
of <HI>Opium,</HI> without the bad ones, tho'
both are but temporary <HI>Reliefs</HI> and not
<HI>Cures:</HI> and who&s;e Virtues will be worn out
by long U&s;e, and therefore ought to be con|tinued
no longer than ab&s;olute Nece&s;&s;ity re|quires,
and not repeated upon too &s;light
Occa&s;ions, for both <HI>Opiates</HI> and <HI>Volatiles</HI> or
<HI>Foetids</HI> are of the Nature of <HI>Drams</HI> and <HI>Cor|dialss;</HI>
and Exerci&s;e will procure Sleep better
than either of the&s;e Medicines, no <HI>Opiate</HI>
being like that of the <HI>Day-Labourers.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; III. MEER Lowne&s;s and Di&s;piritedne&s;s,
not attended with Sickne&s;s or Pain, ari&s;es
from the Want of a brisk <HI>Circulation</HI> and
<HI>Per&s;piration.</HI> The&s;e will always be pro|moted
by <HI>volatile Spirits,</HI> an <HI>Aromatick Cor|dial,</HI>
and generous Wines, or any thing that
will <HI>&s;timulate, rouze,</HI> and <HI>&s;pur</HI> the dead and
langui&s;hing Solids, to pu&s;h forwards the
$luggi&s;h <HI>Circulation</HI> and <HI>Per&s;piration;</HI> but
$he Force of the&s;e Remedies, like all other
Helps and Reliefs of this Nature, is &s;oon
&s;pent and worn out; and they will often
$eave the &s;ame Effects with <HI>Opiates,</HI> the Na|ture
of which they partake: and therefore,
nothing is to be expected from them, but as a
$re&s;ent <HI>Relief</HI> in Extremities, nor are they to
<PB N="210" REF="246">
be u&s;ed but then only. The mo&s;t &s;olid and
la&s;ting Relief I ever found, for Lowne&s;s
of Spirits, comes from the a&s;tringent Cla&s;s of
Medicines, <HI>Steel, Bark, Japan Earth, &amp;c.</HI>
with <HI>Mineral</HI> and <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Waters, the <HI>Bath</HI>
e&s;pecially, in the temperate and cold Sea&s;ons,
and the <HI>cold Steel Waters,</HI> as <HI>Spaw, Pyrmont,</HI>
or <HI>Tunbridge,</HI> in the hot Weather; but
where none of the&s;e Waters can be had,
from the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Patient's Circum|&s;tances,
<HI>Steel Ru&s;t</HI> with the <HI>Extract</HI> or <HI>Pow|der</HI>

&amp;c.</HI> joined with Aromaticks, &s;uch as the
<HI>Species Diambrae,</HI> and wa&s;h'd down with an
agreeable Bitter, fitted to the Patient's
Strength and Con&s;titution: <HI>Elixir of Vitriol,</HI>
or <HI>Tincture of Steel,</HI> with <HI>Elixir Proprietatis</HI>
in common Water; the&s;e will in a great
mea&s;ure &s;upply the Want of <HI>Mineral Waters,</HI>
and give a due <HI>Reprieve,</HI> to carry on the Cure,
which is only to be attained by the general
Methods already de&s;cribed, without which
nothing effectual is to be done, nor the Re|turn
of the&s;e Di&s;orders prevented; and in|deed
the <HI>Paroxy&s;ms</HI> of this Di&s;temper, when
deep rooted, are &s;o many or &s;o frequent, and
the general Methods require &s;o long Time,
that all the&s;e Medicines, and <HI>Mineral Waters</HI>
al&s;o, will be wanted in their Turns.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. ONE of the mo&s;t <HI>di&s;piriting</HI> Symp|toms
of this Di&s;temper, and one of the mo&s;t
<PB N="211" REF="247">
certain Signs of it, is a frequent Di&s;charge
of thin, limpid, pale Water, by <HI>Urine:</HI>
which, when in great Quantities, and fre|quently
di&s;charged, does &s;o &s;ink and di&s;pirit
the poor Patient, that Life is in&s;upportable,
at lea&s;t, if he is not otherwi&s;e &s;trong and
hearty. Some, to explain this Appearance,
have run into I don't know what <HI>Fu&s;ion</HI> of the
Blood, and <HI>Relaxation</HI> of the Glands of the
<HI>Kidneys.</HI> But having now done with <HI>Theory,</HI>
I &s;hall &s;ay nothing directly to confute this
$b&s;urd <HI>Hypothe&s;is,</HI> it being, I think, pretty
evident, and confirmed by many Experi|ments,
e&s;pecially tho&s;e of <HI>Sanctorius</HI> and
$r. <HI>Keil,</HI> that it is principally owing to a
partial or total Ob&s;truction of the <HI>Per&s;pi|$ation,</HI>
which is &s;o common in this Ca&s;e,
from the Weakne&s;s of the <HI>Nerves</HI> and <HI>Solids:</HI>
and that con&s;equently nothing el&s;e can po&s;&s;i|$ly
cure its returning Fits, or remove it,
$ut what makes the <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> good: and
accordingly this Symptom is always relieved
by tho&s;e of the <HI>warm, cordial,</HI> and <HI>diapho|$$tick</HI>
Kind, &s;uch as <HI>Ga&s;coign Powder, Spe|$$es
Diambrae, Aromaticum Gariophyllatum,
$onfectio Alkermes, Dia&s;cordium, Venice
$$eacle, Sir Walter Raleigh's Cordial,</HI> and
the like, or by a Combination of the&s;e, with
<HI>Volatiles</HI> and <HI>foetid Gums,</HI> and appropriated
<HI>$uleps;</HI> the&s;e Medicines however ought not to
be given, &s;o as to rai&s;e an actual <HI>Diaphore&s;is</HI>
$word$ Sweating, for that will be to carry on the
<PB N="212" REF="248">
Expence, Lowne&s;s, and Sinking by other
Conduits: but only to procure a little
Breathing or freer <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI> and to di|vide
the Evacuation more equally through the
whole Habit.</P>
<P>&sect; V. AS to the <HI>Spitting</HI> or <HI>Salivation,</HI> &s;o
common in <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers (e&s;pecially
of a <HI>Scorbutick</HI> Origin, as is commonly &s;aid)
and cold Di&s;ea&s;es, tho' it generally ari&s;es
from the &s;ame Cau&s;es, and may be relieved
by the &s;ame Medicines, as the Symptom la&s;t
mentioned, yet &s;ince it is generally a critical
Di&s;charge, or follows &s;ome Exce&s;s in the
Diet or Nouri&s;hment, it ought never to be
&s;topped at fir&s;t by a&s;tringent or warm Medi|cines,
no more than a critical <HI>Diarrhoea,</HI> but
ought rather to be promoted and encouraged
by &s;ome gentle <HI>Ma&s;ticatory</HI> (&s;uch as <HI>Ma&s;tick,
Pellitory, Tobacco,</HI> or the like) as the Patient
can bear it, or has been accu&s;tomed. If it
is exceeding plentiful, with Sickne&s;s, Reach|ing,
and Head-aches, nothing will carry it
off &s;o effectually as a gentle <HI>Vomit,</HI> both as
this will promote the Di&s;charge, and quicken
the <HI>Circulation</HI> and <HI>Per&s;piration:</HI> or by
gentle Stomach Purges, that may be fre|quently
repeated, &s;uch as <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> the <HI>Sto|mach
Pills,</HI> and the like. And thus after
this Di&s;charge has been &s;ufficiently carried
off, the Solids may be &s;trengthened with
A&s;tringents, Bitters, or an Infu&s;ion of the
<PB N="213" REF="249">
<HI>Bark,</HI> with <HI>Aromaticks,</HI> e&s;pecially if made on
Lime Water; and after that, a Cour&s;e of
<HI>Chalybeats</HI> and <HI>Aromaticks,</HI> &s;uch as I have
mentioned in the former <HI>Section,</HI> with Mine|ral
Waters of one Kind or another.</P>
<P>&sect;. VI. THERE are &s;ome other Symptoms
exceedingly trouble&s;ome in <HI>Vapours,</HI> or <HI>Ner|vous</HI>
Di&s;tempers, to wit, <HI>Choaking</HI> and <HI>Gulp|ing,</HI>
the <HI>Symptomatick A&s;thma, Swelling of the
Throat and Stomach, Inflation of the Bowels
with Rumbling and Noi&s;e.</HI> The <HI>Young</HI> are
not &s;o much troubled with the&s;e Symptoms
as the Old and Declining, but they all pro|ceed
from one Cau&s;e, to wit, the Weakne&s;s
and Ob&s;truction of the <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> from the
Imperfection of the <HI>Dige&s;tions,</HI> whereby the
in&s;en&s;ible Steams and Vapours, which ought
to pa&s;s through the Skin freely, are thrown
back into the Cavities of the Body; and
where high and &s;trong Foods are u&s;ed, the&s;e
Steams acquire &s;uch an <HI>Acrimony</HI> and Stimu|lation
as to produce &s;everal other more vio|lent
Symptoms. The Cure of the&s;e is the
&s;ame with that of the already mentioned
Symptoms, to wit, gentle and repeated <HI>Vo|mits</HI>
and Stomach <HI>Purges,</HI> e&s;pecially of the
<HI>Aloetick</HI> Kind (which in <HI>Nervous</HI> Ca&s;es are by
far preferable to all other Purgatives, becau&s;e
of their active a&s;tringent Bitter) <HI>Aromaticks,
Bitters,</HI> warm <HI>cordial</HI> Medicines, <HI>A&s;tringents,</HI>
and whatever el&s;e will carry off the offend|ing
<PB N="214" REF="250">
Matter, forward the Per&s;piration, and
&s;trengthen the <HI>Dige&s;tion</HI> and <HI>Solids.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. VII. THERE is a tran&s;ient Spice of <HI>Va|pours,</HI>
which very commonly &s;eizes even
young and temperate Per&s;ons, otherwi&s;e
&s;trong and healthy, of pretty &s;ound Juices
and firm Solids, which affects with a Di&s;gu&s;t
of every thing that u&s;ed to plea&s;e or amu&s;e
them, a certain <HI>Tediou&s;ne&s;s of Life,</HI> a <HI>Low|ne&s;s
of Spirits, Re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, Heavyne&s;s,</HI> and
<HI>Anxiety,</HI> an Aver&s;ion to <HI>Exerci&s;e,</HI> either of
the Mind or Body, and &s;ometimes with a
violent <HI>Head-ach,</HI> and Dimn$$s of Sight,
which Symptoms, as they will come on un|accountably,
without any imaginable or di&s;|coverable
Cau&s;e, &s;o they will go off as un|accountably,
in &s;ome &s;hort Time, without
any Medicine or Means u&s;ed for their Cure:
tho' in Strictne&s;s of Rea&s;oning, they have a
real material Cau&s;e, either from Catching of
Cold, and thereby &s;topping the Per&s;piration
&s;uddenly, from the Moi&s;ture of the Weather,
relaxing the Solids, or from &s;ome Intem|perance
or Exce&s;s that they had not heeded,
and were not aware of, or from taking &s;ome
Food too hard for their dige&s;tive Powers.
The common and ordinary Way of treating
&s;uch <HI>tran&s;itory Symptoms,</HI> is, the eating next
Meal &s;ome &s;alt, &s;avoury, and reli&s;hing Deli|cacy,
and drinking a good large Do&s;e of &s;ome
&s;carce, active, generous, and &s;pirituous Li|quor,
<PB N="215" REF="251">
that may briskly rou&s;e and &s;timulate
the &s;luggi&s;h and unactive Solids, and rarefy,
warm, and enliven the heavy and dull
Fluids (or, as the Expre&s;&s;ion is, to give
Nature a <HI>Fillip</HI>) to quicken the Circulation,
forward the Per&s;piration, and carry on all
the nece&s;&s;ary Secretions in their due Degree
and Order. The Fact and Experiment is
undeniable, (and has been too often tried
and repeated, to admit of a Doubt) and
I think the Rea&s;on of the Succe&s;s is pretty
plain from what has been &s;aid, and, I am
afraid, has given Occa&s;ion to &s;ome <HI>un|philo&s;ophical</HI>
and unexperienced Per&s;ons to
advi&s;e it as a certain and never-failing
Remedy, even in more frequent, deeper, and
more habitual Symptoms of the&s;e Di&s;orders:
and I fear has been the Cau&s;e of the com|mon
Advice to Per&s;ons of <HI>weak Nerves</HI> and
low Spirits, <HI>to drink a Bottle heartily every
Day,</HI> to take frequent <HI>Drams,</HI> or a <HI>Bowl of
Punch,</HI> and to the U&s;e of <HI>&s;alt Sturgeon, red
Herring, Anchovies, pickled Oy&s;ters, Salmon-gundy,
Ham, pickled</HI> and <HI>potted Foods</HI> of all
Kinds, for a <HI>Provocative.</HI> All I &s;hall &s;ay on this
Head, is, to caution People not to u&s;e this
Cure too frequently, or to expect any great
Feats from it, when &s;uch Symptoms grow
&s;tronger, more frequent, or more deeply
rooted in the Con&s;titution, or towards the
<HI>Decline</HI> of Life; for tho' it may give a &s;hort
<HI>temporary</HI> Relief, and la&s;h the &s;luggi&s;h and
<PB N="216" REF="252">
re&s;ty Solids to perform their Functions for a
&s;hort Time, yet it will infallibly aggravate
and increa&s;e their future <HI>Symptoms,</HI> and at
la&s;t render them dangerous and incurable.
The much &s;afer, and even more infallible,
tho' perhaps, le&s;s quick Remedy, would
be to take &s;ome gentle <HI>Stomach</HI> Purge, that
might not interrupt Bu&s;ine&s;s, and, the next
Night, &s;ome ea&s;y <HI>Diaphoretick,</HI> a lighter
Diet than ordinary, for a few Days, or u&s;e
a greater Degree of Exerci&s;e, by a Journey,
Hunting, and the like.</P>
<P>&sect; VIII. THESE are the mo&s;t material, mo&s;t
trouble&s;ome, and oppre&s;&s;ing <HI>Symptoms</HI> of
<HI>Vapours.</HI> Others le&s;s material may be re|duc'd
to the&s;e mention'd, or are &s;ome Ap|pendages
of them; or, if omitted here, per|haps
may be taken Notice of in treating of
the higher Degrees of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders,
or may be entirely neglected as in&s;ignificant.
I have &s;ugge&s;ted nothing in treating the&s;e, but
the common and well known Medicines, not
only becau&s;e by long Experience, I have found
them the mo&s;t effectual, but even becau&s;e
they are common, and univer&s;ally known
and approved. For it is in <HI>Medicines</HI> as in
<HI>Food</HI> (Medicines being only a more <HI>rare</HI> and
le&s;s natural Kind of Food) that which is
<HI>common</HI> to the middling Sort of every Coun|try,
and which has the Approbation of the
Generality of the Inhabitants, and is &s;uited
<PB N="217" REF="253">
to the Con&s;titution of the Community, is
generally the mo&s;t <HI>beneficial;</HI> &s;ince it is the
Experience and Ob&s;ervation of the Gene|rality
that makes them common: and &s;pe|cial
or particular Things, or Rarities, are
ju&s;tly to be &s;u&s;pected.</P>

<P>&sect; I. AS mo&s;t of tho&s;e Di&s;orders which
are commonly called <HI>Nervous,

Degrees, and to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Stage of <HI>Vapours,</HI>
which I have denominated or di&s;tingui&s;hed
by the&s;e Symptoms chiefly: I &s;hall here
treat of the&s;e Di&s;orders in general, &s;hewing
<PB N="218" REF="254">
the Nature of all <HI>Convul&s;ions,</HI> but particu|larly
tho&s;e incident to &s;uch Con&s;titutions, and
attending the&s;e Di&s;tempers that I am princi|pally
treating of, and laying down the pro|per
and peculiar Method of Cure, for each
Kind or Degree.</P>
<P>&sect; II. IT is well known, that whatever
will prick, wound, tear, or violently &s;timu|late
the Solids, will thereby produce <HI>Spa&s;ms,
Convul&s;ions,</HI> and violent <HI>Contractions,</HI> fir&s;t
and chiefly in the Part affected: which, by
Con&s;ent, and the <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> of the Parts,
may be communicated further and further
over the whole <HI>Machine;</HI> and, when vehe|ment
and continu'd, may be propagated
through all the <HI>Limbs, Mu&s;cles, Tendons</HI> and
<HI>Membranes</HI> of the Body, and this where-ever
the Wound, or whatever Part of the Solids
the Puncture or Stimulation happens to be
made in; but mo&s;t readily where there is
the greate&s;t Collection of <HI>Nerves.</HI> This is
evident from the Effects of a Fall, a Blow, a
Brui&s;e, the Puncture of a <HI>Lancet,</HI> a <HI>Thorn,</HI> a
<HI>Pin,</HI> a <HI>Nail,</HI> or any other wounding In&s;tru|ment,
or from &s;harp and corroding Steams,
Humours, or Matter (which are as it were a
Collection of &s;mall Pins, Needles, Lancets,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI>) upon any of the more &s;en&s;ible Solids. I
have before &s;hew'd, that there is in all Ani|mal
<HI>Fibres</HI> an innate Power of Contraction,
or an original <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> of <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> or
<PB N="219" REF="255">
<HI>Spring,</HI> by which they exert a natural
Power of Contraction, however they are &s;ti|mulated
or &s;olicited thereto, whether by the
Command of the Will, (beginning the Mo|tion
by an inexplicable Effort) or &s;elf-motive
Power: or by the Action of &s;ome material
appropriated Agent on them, and this in
every <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> as well as <HI>Nervous Fibre</HI> of
the Body. I have &s;een a <HI>fi&s;tulous Tube,</HI> of a
very con&s;iderable Length, holding &s;ome
Quarts of <HI>Pus</HI> or <HI>Matter,</HI> opening only to|wards
the Middle of the Back, and pa&s;&s;ing
down from thence between the Inter&s;tices of
the <HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI> to the Thigh; which when the
Matter contain'd in it, was arriv'd to its full
Degree of <HI>Quantity</HI> and <HI>Acrimony,</HI> &s;o as to
produce a <HI>Symptomatick</HI> Fever; the Solids
of the whole Machine, but particularly tho&s;e
near the <HI>fi&s;tulous Canal,</HI> were &s;timulated and
put in Action, &s;o that it threw out that va&s;t
Quantity of its Contents, upwards and again&s;t
the Force of their own Gravity; tho' &s;uch a
<HI>Canal</HI> was not made naturally, or with the
greate&s;t Advantage for &s;uch an Action: From
whence it is evident, that every Point and
Particle of the <HI>Solids</HI> is <HI>ela&s;tick,</HI> and acts for the

<P>&sect; III. THIS being premi&s;ed, it is evident,
that any acrid, &s;harp, or corroding Juice,
<HI>Vapour,</HI> or <HI>Steam</HI> that will &s;timulate and
v$llicate the <HI>Fibres</HI> where-ever placed, may

occa&s;ion <HI>Convul&s;ions, Spa&s;ms, Gripes</HI> or Pains
on that Part fir&s;t and chiefly, and may be

the adjacent Parts, and even thro' the whole
Habit, continuing till the offending Matter

off, or removed: in the &s;ame Manner as the

rai&s;es tho&s;e Vomitings and Reachings that

&s;harp</HI> and <HI>porracious</HI> Juices, occa&s;ion tho&s;e
<HI>Fits</HI> and <HI>Convul&s;ions</HI> in the Bowels (like <HI>Ver|juice,

that are common in <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. As to <HI>Childrens Convul&s;ions,</HI> if they
proceed from the &s;hooting the Teeth, whereby
the <HI>Gums</HI> and their <HI>Membranes</HI> are di&s;tended,
<PB N="221" REF="257">
torn, and lacerated, they are ea&s;ily cured by
<HI>Inci&s;ion;</HI> but if they ari&s;e from &s;harp Juices
in the Stomach or Bowels (as they mo&s;t
commonly do) and the Child is about the
fir&s;t Year of its Age, they may be cur'd by
a <HI>Bli&s;ter</HI> between the Shoulders; gentle <HI>Rhu|barb</HI>
Purges, frequently repeated; and the
<HI>Te&s;taceous Powders</HI> taken two or three times
a day in a little black Cherry Water or Brea&s;t
Milk, but e&s;pecially by <HI>Cinnabar</HI> in Pow|ders,
with the <HI>te&s;taceous</HI> Powders and <HI>Rhu|barb</HI>
interchangeably: Sometimes a few
Drops of <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>Hart&s;horn,</HI> or <HI>Goddards
Drops,</HI> taken two or three times a Day in
common Water, if the Con&s;titution, Juices,
and Solids are pretty &s;ound, will do the
Bu&s;ine&s;s. But if their <HI>Fits</HI> be &s;tronger, and
they further advanc'd in Life, they mu&s;t be
overcome, by gentle <HI>Vomits</HI> fitted to their
Age and Strength. <HI>Cinnabar of Antimony,</HI>
with the <HI>Pulvis ad Guttetam,</HI> and the&s;e <HI>Rhu|barb</HI>
Purges, interchangeably us'd, as has
been &s;aid. But it is to be ob&s;erv'd during
the whole Cour&s;e, that if the Child is on
the Brea&s;t, it ought to be fed with nothing
but its <HI>Nur&s;e</HI>'s <HI>Milk,</HI> or, if wean'd, with
nothing but thin <HI>Pap,</HI> at lea&s;t till it has
gone over its <HI>Teething;</HI> and, to give a due
Force and Strength afterwards, the <HI>Quin|quina</HI>
ought to be us'd either in <HI>Extract</HI> or
<HI>Decoction,</HI> e&s;pecially after it has acquir'd
&s;ome Years. This Method will not only
<PB N="222" REF="258">
cure their <HI>Fits,</HI> but their <HI>Rickets</HI> likewi&s;e,
both proceeding from the &s;ame Cau&s;e, to wit,
<HI>acrid Humours</HI> lodged in the Stomach or
Bowels, or &s;ome other Part of the Body, and
a <HI>Relaxation</HI> of the Solids.</P>
<P>&sect; V. IF &s;uch <HI>Convul&s;ions</HI> happen to the
younger Part of the Sex about a certain
Time of their Lives (as they often do) then
they generally proceed from &s;ome Di&s;order
in that great Affair, which ought, if po&s;|&s;ible,
to be &s;et to Rights. But &s;ince, before
that can be anyways executed, there gene|rally
happens a great Quantity of <HI>Choler,</HI>
either generated through the Defect of that
Evacuation, or in whatever other Manner:
or from whatever Cau&s;e: this is by all po&s;|&s;ible
Means to be fir&s;t remov'd; which is only
or mo&s;t readily and effectually to be per|formed,
by frequent <HI>Vomits</HI> fitted to the
Strength of the Patient, and of the Di&s;ea&s;e.
While that is doing, the <HI>volatile</HI> active <HI>Gums,</HI>
with the <HI>volatile alcaline Salts,</HI> are to be com|bin'd
with <HI>Cinnabar</HI> of Antimony in &s;ome
Form or other. This Method is to be car|ried
on till the Fits are weakened, the Quan|tity
of the <HI>Bile</HI> le&s;&s;en'd, and the <HI>primae Viae</HI>
pretty clear; and then, and not till then,
will proper <HI>Emmenagogues,</HI> with <HI>Steel, Cha|lybeat
Mineral Waters, Bitters,</HI> and <HI>Aroma|ticks</HI>
take Place. In the Fits them&s;elves
there is little to be done but by <HI>Volatiles</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="259">
and <HI>Opiates,</HI> in appropriated <HI>Juleps</HI> to le&s;&s;en
their Violence, and to quiet their <HI>Spa&s;ms;</HI>
but by a &s;teady Continuance in this Method,
and a proper <HI>Regimen of Diet,</HI> I &s;carce ever
&s;aw the Patient mi&s;carry.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. AS to the <HI>Fits</HI> of grown Per&s;ons,
<HI>Hy&s;terical</HI> or <HI>Hypochondriacal,</HI> though they
proceed generally from the general Cau&s;es
mention'd, and are to be treated much after
the &s;ame Manner, yet they are infinitely
more ob&s;tinate and difficult to be remov'd:
the Habit of Body being more deprav'd, and
the Di&s;ea&s;es more rooted and confirm'd, thro'
a long Train of <HI>Mi&s;management,</HI> and Neglect
of the Means by which Health is to be pre|&s;erv'd;
and in the higher Degrees of the&s;e,
there are commonly &s;ome one or other of the
great Bowels (as the <HI>Liver</HI> and its Appendages,
the <HI>Me&s;entery,</HI> the <HI>Cawl,</HI> the <HI>Spleen</HI> or the
<HI>Stomach</HI>) if not quite &s;poil'd, yet much
weaken'd and ob&s;tructed, and all the <HI>Glands</HI>
&s;tuff'd and render'd u&s;ele&s;s. To le&s;&s;en the
Violence of the <HI>Fits,</HI> at lea&s;t in the fir&s;t In|&s;tance,
all the great Evacuations are to be
attempted, e&s;pecially <HI>Bleeding, Vomiting,
Bli&s;ters, Gly&s;ters,</HI> and the like; and then
the <HI>Spa&s;ms</HI> and <HI>Convul&s;ions</HI> are to be quieted
by <HI>Opiates,</HI> with warm and <HI>volatile</HI> Medicines
and <HI>Foetid Gums,</HI> according to the Strength of
the Patient and the Nece&s;&s;ity of the Di&s;ea&s;e.
If the&s;e Evacuations cannot be conveniently
<PB N="224" REF="260">
made, or do not &s;oon enough take Effect,
there is nothing el&s;e to be done under the
Fits, but by the&s;e mention'd <HI>Opiates,</HI> with
the <HI>volatile Gums</HI> and <HI>Salts, Pulvis ad Gut|tetam,
Aromaticks</HI> and <HI>Alcaline Spirits,</HI> in
proper <HI>Juleps,</HI> till a convenient Interval be
obtain'd, or the Violence of the <HI>Convul&s;ions</HI>
cea&s;es, and then rouzing <HI>Vomits</HI> are to be
thrown down, and after that &s;harp <HI>Gly&s;ters</HI>
(with <HI>Emetick</HI> Wine, and <HI>volatile Spirits</HI> in
them, which will check their further Return
for &s;ome time.) This Method is to be re|peated
as often as the&s;e <HI>Paroxy&s;ms</HI> return.
During the Intervals <HI>Cinnabarine Medicines,</HI> or
<HI>Aethiops Mineral,</HI> the <HI>Mercurius Dulcis,</HI> or
<HI>Alcali&s;atus,</HI> with the <HI>volatile Gums</HI> and <HI>Salts,</HI>
are to be taken once or twice a Day, with <HI>Cha|lybeat</HI>
Waters, and <HI>Aromatick</HI> Bitters, and at
Night the <HI>Gum Pills</HI> compounded with the
<HI>volatile Salts,</HI> the general Method already laid
down, being at the &s;ame time regularly pur|&s;ued.
Which Method and Medicines, if duly
continu'd for a &s;ufficient Time, cannot fail of
Succe&s;s, if any thing will &s;ucceed, and the
Patient not too far advanc'd in Life, or &s;ome
of the great <HI>Organs</HI> are not quite &s;poiled. But
in my Judgment and Ob&s;ervation, the greate&s;t
Stre&s;s is to be laid (e&s;pecially in gro&s;s Habits,
or Symptoms produced even by <HI>relative</HI>
Intemperance only) in the Medicinal Way
upon <HI>Vomits</HI> often repeated, <HI>Quinquina Bit|ters,
Aloetick Purges,</HI> and <HI>Mineral</HI> or <HI>Cha|lybeat</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="261">
Waters; which not &s;ucceeding, little
is to be expected from <HI>Art,</HI> the other le&s;s
effectual Methods being too weak for &s;uch
Ca&s;es and Con&s;titutions, and therefore they
mu&s;t be entirely left to the <HI>Palliative</HI> Re|medies
of warm <HI>Opiates,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Venice Treacle,</HI>
the <HI>Philonium Romanum,</HI> with high and
&s;trong <HI>Cordial Juleps</HI> and <HI>Volatiles,</HI> &s;uch as I
have already mention'd. Tho&s;e who are of
thinner Habits, and who&s;e Bowels therefore
are not probably &s;o much <HI>&s;tuff'd</HI> and <HI>ob&s;tru|cted,</HI>
will have a fairer Chance, and be
re&s;tored with gentler Evacuations, &s;maller
Do&s;es of <HI>Opiates, volatile,</HI> or <HI>cordial</HI> Medi|cines,
and more ea&s;ily recover'd by <HI>Diet,
Air, Exerci&s;e, Chalybeat</HI> and <HI>Mineral</HI> Waters,
with <HI>Aromatick</HI> and <HI>Quinquina</HI> Bitters, and
tho&s;e other Things I have &s;o often men|tioned.</P>
<P>&sect; VII. As to the <HI>Fits</HI> attending other
<HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders, as the <HI>Apoplexy, Epilep&s;y,</HI>
and the like, that Part of them which is <HI>con|$ul&s;ive,</HI>
depending entirely on the <HI>primary</HI>
Di&s;temper, being the Struggle of Nature to
throw off the peccant Cau&s;e, if it were po&s;|&s;ible
to &s;eparate them, they were to be treated
in the &s;ame Manner, and by the &s;ame
Medicines: But intending to &s;ay &s;omething
of them in particular, I &s;hall here pa&s;s them
by, and only add, that the &s;everal <HI>Forms,
Do&s;es,</HI> and other Circum&s;tances in u&s;ing the&s;e
<PB N="226" REF="262">
Medicines, I have already mentioned in the
proper Ca&s;es, requires the Attention of the
wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t experienced Phy&s;ician, to
whom the&s;e Means and Medicines may be
familiar, and are never to be tru&s;ted to any
one not duly and regularly in&s;tructed and
educated in the&s;e Matters, much le&s;s to the
Patient him&s;elf, who, let his Knowledge and
even Experience be ever &s;o great, yet under
them, he is not capable to judge for him|&s;elf,
and therefore there will be no Occa&s;ion
for being more particular and circum&s;tan|tial.</P>

<P>&sect; I. HAVING, I hope, &s;olidly and
ju&s;tly e&s;tabli&s;hed the Cau&s;e
and Principles, on which the
Differences between <HI>Nervous</HI> and humorous
or inflammatory Di&s;orders (as they are

Matter to apply this general Doctrine to par|ticular
<PB N="227" REF="263">
Di&s;tempers, to &s;hew wherein their
true and e&s;&s;ential Nature and Difference con|&s;i&s;ts,
and thereby the Solid Intention to be
followed in their particular Cure. For the
only real Difference lies in the Firmne&s;s or
Laxity of the Solids; to wit, that the&s;e Di&s;|tempers
are or ought to be called <HI>Nervous</HI>
only, when they are attended with a loo&s;e

they are or ought to be deemed humorous,
hot, or inflammatory, when the Solids are
as yet ten&s;e and firm, the Symptoms high,
and the State of the Blood inflammatory;
for tho' in both Ca&s;es, the great differential
Marks of the Di&s;temper will appear, yet the
Symptoms will be higher and more acute, or
weaker and &s;lower, and will be attended
with &s;ome other Appearances, con&s;equent
upon the Strength or Weakne&s;s of the Con|&s;titution,
tho' in both of them, the &s;ame Ma|terials
&s;hould be thrown in, to produce the

Con&s;titution of a <HI>Nervous</HI> (or, as it is &s;ome|times

had &s;ome of the Symptoms and Marks
which I have a&s;&s;igned, in a former <HI>Chapter,</HI>
to belong to weak <HI>Nerves</HI> or <HI>Fibres:</HI> The
Symptoms of &s;uch a <HI>Fever</HI> are the&s;e follow|ing;
the <HI>Rigour</HI> and <HI>Chilline&s;s,</HI> tho' not &s;o
&s;trong or violent at fir&s;t, yet is longer, more
&s;low and imperceptible; the <HI>Burning Heat</HI>
afterwards is not &s;o inten&s;e, nor the <HI>Head|ach</HI>

Sicki&s;hne&s;s; the <HI>Pul&s;e</HI> is neither &s;o quick,
&s;trong, or full, as in the <HI>inflammatory</HI> Kinds,
but &s;mall, oppre&s;&s;ed, and &s;ometimes inter|rupted;
the <HI>Sleep</HI> re&s;embles a <HI>Lethargick</HI>

pale, and in great Quantity, without any
great <HI>Sediment</HI> at fir&s;t; In &s;hort, the <HI>Fever</HI>
rather creeps in, than attacks or &s;urprizes,
and the whole Duration of the <HI>Exordium</HI> or
fir&s;t Stage, is more &s;low and tedious, than
in acute, inflammatory, or depuratory <HI>Fevers,</HI>
in&s;omuch that it is &s;ometimes &s;ix, &s;even, or
perhaps nine Days before it comes to its
<HI>State,</HI> by which any one may judge of the
<HI>Duration</HI> of the whole (for the &s;ooner a
<HI>Fever</HI> comes to its <HI>State,</HI> the &s;horter is it$
<HI>Duration</HI>) and of its Danger, which is always
<PB N="229" REF="265">
greater from its Nature, and al&s;o becau&s;e it
is long before A&s;&s;i&s;tance is called, or Means

the <HI>Head</HI> is &s;tupid, confu&s;ed, and incapable,

leaping and jumping: and Pul&s;ations from
Flatulency, like what is vulgarly called the
<HI>Life-Blood,</HI> in &s;everal Parts of the Body;
and during this whole <HI>Period,</HI> uncertain
Fits of Coldne&s;s and Rigour, with &s;ucceed|ing
Glowings, and broken, coldi&s;h, faint
Sweats, and con&s;tant <HI>Exacerbations</HI> towards
Night, or after Sun-&s;et; the <HI>Belly,</HI> tho'
perhaps it might be open, and tending to|wards
a <HI>Diarrhoea</HI> at fir&s;t, becomes now
quite con&s;tipate and tumified with Flatu|lencies;
the <HI>Tip</HI> of the No&s;e and the Ears
often cold with an <HI>Ichor,</HI> and &s;ometimes an

<PB N="230" REF="266">
Po&s;ture of the Body, with &s;imple childi&s;h

This State continues, or grows wor&s;e, from
the <HI>fifteenth</HI> to the <HI>twentieth,</HI> or <HI>thirtieth,</HI>
or &s;ometimes the <HI>fortieth</HI> Day, if they live
&s;o long (as generally the Time of the <HI>Cri&s;e</HI>
of all Fevers is as long as the <HI>Exordium,</HI> and
the <HI>Duration</HI> of the <HI>State,</HI> is equal to that of
both fir&s;t and la&s;t Periods together). Towards
the End of this <HI>Fever,</HI> they either &s;leep, as it

happens, it is either into a meer <HI>Languor</HI>

This <HI>Fever</HI> (which always ari&s;es
from a <HI>Cachexy</HI> and great Ob&s;tructions, as
well as weak Solids, and which enters,
in &s;ome Degree, into our <HI>Malignant Fevers</HI>
of all Kinds) has infinite Degrees and Va|riety,
according to the original Strength of
the <HI>Fibres,</HI> or the Time of the Patient's Life,
but tho&s;e I have de&s;cribed are the mo&s;t com|mon,
and perhaps the wor&s;t Symptoms, as
any one who has &s;een and ob&s;erved them
mu&s;t know.</P>
<P>&sect; III. FROM this De&s;cription of the
Di&s;ea&s;e, and what I have already &s;aid about
<PB N="231" REF="267">
the Symptoms of <HI>Vapours,</HI> it is pretty evi|dent,
what will be the principal <HI>Intention,</HI>
and the be&s;t manner of treating it, <HI>viz.</HI> the
Grinding, Breaking, and Di&s;&s;olving the Co|he&s;ion,
Vi&s;cidity, and Sharpne&s;s of the
Fluids, and throwing them off by the &s;afe&s;t
and mo&s;t patent Outlets. All the Eva|cuations
mu&s;t be gentle, except <HI>Vomiting,</HI>
which may be repeated freely thro' all the
Stages (if the Symptoms require, and
Strength permit, but e&s;pecially in the Be|ginning)
and <HI>Bli&s;tering,</HI> which nece&s;&s;arily
mu&s;t be as exten&s;ive and univer&s;al as po&s;&s;ible,
tho' not violent, or all at once, but gradually
applying one or more Bli&s;ters on different
Parts, as the others dry up: As to <HI>Bleeding,</HI>
I think it ought to be done once, and but
cautiou&s;ly repeated, be the Blood ever &s;o
<HI>&s;izy</HI> and <HI>Rheumatick,</HI> becau&s;e the Ve&s;&s;els
mu&s;t be kept full, tho' not turgid, in order
to pre&s;erve their <HI>Ten&s;ion,</HI> for grinding or
concocting the Morbid Matter. The much
better Way is to endeavour by all the Means
po&s;&s;ible in <HI>Art,</HI> to thin and dilute, to re|move
the Ob&s;tructions, and to rou&s;e the
weak and langui&s;hing Solids into a more
hearty Struggle, both by <HI>Diet</HI> and Medi|cines,
to conquer the Di&s;ea&s;e. This is to be
done by the <HI>Cinnabarin, Antimonial,</HI> and
<HI>Mineral</HI> Medicines chiefly, &s;uch as <HI>Antimony
Diaphoretick, Bezoar Mineral, Cinnabar,</HI>
and the like, joined with volatile and urinous
<PB N="232" REF="268">
Salts, &s;uch as that of <HI>Hart&s;horn, Amber, &amp;c.</HI>
and the&s;e again compounded with gentle
<HI>Diaphoreticks,</HI> as <HI>Saffron, Contrayerva, Goa
Stone, Oriental Bezoar, Ga&s;coign Powder,</HI> or
the warmer Compounds, as <HI>Confectio Alker|mes,
Venice Treacle, Dia&s;cordium</HI> without
<HI>Opium, Confectio Rawleiana, Electuarium de
Sa&s;&s;afras, &amp;c.</HI> wa&s;h'd down with appropriated
Juleps, and quickened with volatile Spirits, as
tho&s;e of <HI>Hart&s;horn, Sal-volatile,</HI> or <HI>Goddard</HI>'s
Drops, for here univer&s;ally Liquid Forms
are to be preferred to Solid ones; and thus
to try to overcome the Vi&s;cidity of the Juices,
and to rouze the Sluggi&s;hne&s;s of the Solids
to a brisker <HI>Circulation</HI> and Struggle, for
which Purpo&s;e the <HI>Diet,</HI> at lea&s;t the Li|quids
are allowed commonly a little &s;tronger
and higher than in <HI>inflammatory Fevers;</HI>
tho' I &s;hall ever be of Opinion, where there
is any Degree of quick Pul&s;e or praeter|natural
Heat, <HI>Diluents</HI> and <HI>Coolers</HI> are
directly indicated, whether in <HI>Fevers inflam|matory</HI>
or <HI>nervous:</HI> and <HI>Cordials</HI> and high
Food only as the Pul&s;e and Spirits &s;ink too
low. I allow that if <HI>Art</HI> could always <HI>prompt,
whip, &s;pur,</HI> and <HI>&s;timulate</HI> the <HI>Animal Oeco|nomy</HI>
to grind the &s;izy Juices by a &s;trong
and brisk Circulation, the <HI>Fever</HI> would be
&s;horter, and the <HI>Cri&s;e</HI> more complete, and
the <HI>diluting, cooling</HI> Method of Cure le&s;s ne|ce&s;&s;ary:
But as that is both uncertain and
un&s;afe, becau&s;e none alive can a&s;certain the
<PB N="233" REF="269">
preci&s;e Degree of Strength in the Patient,
nor of the Malignity in the Di&s;ea&s;e, and
that the <HI>Cri&s;e,</HI> (if attainable) under &s;uch a
Method, is almo&s;t ever with the quite De|&s;truction
of the whole <HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> of the <HI>Nerves,</HI>
the <HI>Brain,</HI> the <HI>Faculties,</HI> the <HI>Limbs,</HI> or the
whole rational <HI>Man:</HI> and therefore the cool
Method, tho' tedious, yet is ever without
Danger, and the Recovery, when obtained
(which the cool Method will always obtain
at la&s;t, if the Di&s;temper is not &s;tronger than
the Patient, as well in <HI>Acute</HI> as <HI>Chronical</HI>
Ca&s;es) always complete, full, and pro|ductive
of &s;trong Health after. This is all
I need to &s;ay of <HI>Nervous Fevers,</HI> as di&s;|tingui&s;hed
from hot and depuratory ones.
How to fetch up the Patient, if he re|covers,
to Health and Spirits, I have &s;hewn
already.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. THE <HI>Nervous Cholick,</HI> as di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
from the <HI>Bilious,</HI> ari&s;ing chiefly in
&s;uch Con&s;titutions as I have de&s;cribed, dif|fers
principally, if not only, from that, in
the Violence and Duration of its <HI>Paroxy&s;ms,</HI>
and there being more of the <HI>Convul&s;ive</HI> or
<HI>Spa&s;modick</HI> Kind in them: produced chiefly
by the &s;ame Kind of acrid and &s;harp Juices;
but as the Solids, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Ca&s;e, are more
&s;en&s;ible and irritable, a le&s;s Quantity of this
$rritating Matter throws them into more vio|$ent
<HI>Tumults</HI> and <HI>Convul&s;ions,</HI> which la&s;ts
<PB N="234" REF="270">
&s;ometimes two or three Days with violent
<HI>Tortures, Reachings,</HI> and <HI>Vomitings,</HI> throw|ing
up every thing that is taken down, till
at la&s;t the morbifick Matter being quite
&s;pent and ejected for this Time, Nature,
almo&s;t overlaid and worn out, &s;inks down
into a <HI>lethargick</HI> Do&s;ing, which leaves the
Patient quite feeble and di&s;pirited. A Cold|ne&s;s
upon the Extremities, <HI>Yawning, Anxiety,</HI>
a <HI>Nau&s;ea,</HI> and Sicki&s;hne&s;s, are the Signs of
the Approach of this Kind of <HI>Cholick,</HI> and
&s;uch recover but &s;lowly, and at fir&s;t their
Intervals are but &s;hort. I generally &s;u&s;pect
that the <HI>Liver</HI> of &s;uch is beginning to be
faulty, bigger and larger than ordinary, or
ob&s;tructed: becau&s;e of the great Quantity of
<HI>Bile</HI> that is con&s;tantly thrown off, and the
<HI>Jaundice,</HI> that always &s;ucceeds it for &s;ome
Days, which probably may have been occa|&s;ioned
by a <HI>Mal-Regimen,</HI> or too great a
Quantity of high Food, at lea&s;t, for &s;uch
Con&s;titutions: for it is well known, that
Cramming and Over-feeding with higher
than a natural Food, as I have &s;aid, will
&s;well and increa&s;e the <HI>Livers</HI> of all Ani|mals.</P>
<P>&sect; V. THE Cure of this Di&s;temper is al|mo&s;t
intirely the &s;ame with that mentioned
in a former <HI>Chapter</HI> of the Symptoms of
Vapours. If the <HI>Fits</HI> are not prevented by
frequent <HI>Vomits,</HI> proportioned to the Strength
<PB N="235" REF="271">
of the Patient, or gentle <HI>Stomach Purges</HI> to
throw off the peccant bilious Humour as
collected, nothing can be done in the Fit,
but by repeated Do&s;es of <HI>Opiates,</HI> with pro|per
<HI>Cordials,</HI> as often as they are thrown
up, either in a &s;olid or liquid Form: to &s;top
and allay the <HI>Torture</HI> till the Fit is quite
&s;pent; and a gentle Stomach Purge, (if the
Bowels can bear it without too much Irri|tation)
with a Do&s;e of <HI>Laudanum</HI> to quiet
them afterwards; the Intervals are to be
filled up with <HI>Chalybeats, Aromaticks, Bit|ters,
Mineral Waters,</HI> a &s;trict Regimen of
Diet, and much Exerci&s;e, or a <HI>total</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Sydenham Di&s;&s;ert. Epi&s;t. de Affectione Hy&s;terica.</NOTE> <HI>Milk
Diet,</HI> which &s;eldom fails to cure this Di&s;|order,
if the Patient is not too far gone in
Life, or &s;ome of the great <HI>Vi&s;cera</HI> &s;poiled,
and irremediably ruined, in which Ca&s;e, it
terminates in one of the incurable Di&s;tem|pers
I have &s;o often mentioned.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. As to Nervous <HI>Gouts, Rheuma|ti&s;ms,</HI>
and <HI>A&s;thma's,</HI> they being generally
denominated thus from tho&s;e Con&s;titutions I
have mentioned to be mo&s;t &s;ubject to <HI>Nervous</HI>
Di&s;tempers, it were a needle&s;s Repetition to
&s;ay any thing of the&s;e Di&s;ea&s;es; in general,
they being to be met with in tho&s;e Authors
that have treated profe&s;&s;edly of them, and
<PB N="236" REF="272">
what regards them &s;pecially as they are
<HI>Nervous,</HI> being ea&s;ily deduced from the ge|neral
Doctrine of <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers, and
what has been &s;aid of the &s;everal Symptoms
in particular: only in <HI>Nervous A&s;thma</HI>'s with
Flegm, or perhaps, (as I have already in&s;i|nuated)
in <HI>Humorous A&s;thma</HI>'s, both of Per|&s;ons
of firm and lax Solids, Liquid Quick&s;ilver,
(or <HI>Bello&s;t</HI>'s Pills made with <HI>Gum Ammoniac</HI>)
will be found a &s;overeign Remedy, if di&s;|cretely
managed, half an Ounce taken once
or twice a Day, with a thin, light, fluid Diet,
will do more than <HI>Ammoniacum</HI> alone, and all
the Cla&s;s of the <HI>Volatile</HI> and <HI>Foetid</HI> Medicines,
to di&s;&s;olve the Flegm, a&s;&s;i&s;t Expectoration,
and to make the Expiration and In&s;piration
ea&s;y; whether this be done by the Weight of

<P>&sect; II. THESE I am principally concerned
about, are &s;uch as happen in the <HI>Decline of
Life,</HI> to Per&s;ons of vitiated Juices and weak
<PB N="240" REF="276">
<HI>Nerves,</HI> where <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders have
preceded, or in which <HI>Vapours</HI> commonly
terminate, who have &s;poiled their Habits, at
lea&s;t, by <HI>relative Intemperance</HI> (which is
always to be under&s;tood when I &s;peak of
Exce&s;&s;es producing Di&s;ea&s;es) &s;uch <HI>Pal&s;ies</HI> are
either a general Seizure of mo&s;t, if not all
the <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> and <HI>Nerves</HI> of the whole Ma|chine,
or of one half of the Body only, as
of the right or left Side, or of the upper
Part of the Body on one Side, with the
lower Part on the other Side, or la&s;tly, of
&s;ome particular <HI>Limb</HI> or <HI>Mu&s;cle.</HI> There
is generally Rea&s;on to conclude from
the Appearances, that be&s;ides a <HI>Laxity</HI> of
the <HI>Nerves,</HI> or a Defect in their innate
Power of Contraction and <HI>Tonical</HI> Nature,
there are likewi&s;e Ob&s;tructions of the Capil|lary
Blood Ve&s;&s;els, from &s;ome Fault in the

the <HI>Pal&s;y.</HI> This is manifect, from the Cure
of a great many inveterate Pal&s;ies, while the
Patient is &s;trong, by <HI>Salivation</HI> or <HI>Mercurial</HI>
Medicines, and yet there is nothing more
evident, than that much <HI>Mercury</HI> or <HI>frequent
Salivations,</HI> in weak Con&s;titutions, will give
<HI>Paralytick Symptoms;</HI> witne&s;s the <HI>Tremor
Mercurialis,</HI> &s;o common in Per&s;ons of weak
<HI>Nerves,</HI> under &s;uch an Operation, from
whence is further confirmed (what was
pretty manife&s;t before, from other Appear|ances)
that towards animal Motion, the In|flux
<PB N="241" REF="277">
of a &s;ound bal&s;amick Blood, to moi&s;ten
and cheri&s;h the fle&s;hy Fibres, is as much
or more nece&s;&s;ary, even than the Integrity
and innate Action of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> or <HI>animal
Spirits</HI> (if you plea&s;e). And as the Faulti|ne&s;s
of both concurs towards producing all
<HI>nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers, &s;o more e&s;pecially to
tho&s;e call'd <HI>Paralytick.</HI> There can be no
Difficulty to one, acquainted with Nature,
and the <HI>animal Oeconomy,</HI> why the &s;ame Cau&s;e,
<HI>Mercury,</HI> for Example, &s;hould cure, and yet
cau&s;e and produce in different Degrees and
Quantities, the very &s;ame Di&s;ea&s;e, to wit, a
<HI>Pal&s;y.</HI> We know, a certain Degree of Heat,
which will only produce <HI>Smoak,</HI> rais'd to a
higher Degree, will produce <HI>Light</HI> and
<HI>Flame:</HI> A certain Degree of Heat, in the
&s;ame <HI>Fomentation,</HI> will di&s;&s;olve and di&s;&s;ipate
a <HI>Tumor,</HI> and a higher Degree of it will
harden and make it <HI>&s;chirrous;</HI> and thus,
<HI>Mercury,</HI> in moderate Do&s;es, will break,
di&s;&s;olve, and attenuate the Blood and Juices,
who&s;e Vi&s;cidity and con&s;equent <HI>Compre&s;&s;ion</HI>
on the <HI>Nerves,</HI> interrupt their Vibrations
and Action, and &s;o produce a <HI>Pal&s;y,</HI> which
a gentle Salivation will remedy and antidote.
But when the <HI>active Steams</HI> and &s;mall <HI>pon|derous
Particles</HI> of <HI>Mercury</HI> have penetrated
and &s;aturated the Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Nerves</HI>
and <HI>Solids,</HI> they will &s;poil and alter their
whole Sub&s;tance and Action, and &s;o cau&s;e
an univer&s;al <HI>Pal&s;y.</HI> But the Juices &s;eem
<PB N="242" REF="278">
to be the principal Cau&s;e of the Difficulty of
the Cure of <HI>Pal&s;ies</HI> in the Decline of Life;
becau&s;e towards old Age the Solids &s;tiffen
and harden at a greater Rate, than in the
younger Part of Life, &s;o the &s;poil'd Juices
are then more hard to be remedied.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. IF a Per&s;on, at or about the <HI>Meri|dian</HI>
of Life, be &s;eiz'd with &s;uch <HI>paralytick</HI>
Di&s;orders, and they are not cur'd, or at lea&s;t
prevented from &s;ettling or confirming at fir&s;t,
they are &s;eldom ever afterwards totally freed
from them, whatever Methods be tried with
them: And therefore, as &s;oon as the Di&s;ea&s;e
is di&s;cover'd, <HI>Bleeding</HI> at fir&s;t, if the Patient is
&s;trong, and the Pul&s;e full, and then <HI>Bli&s;ters,</HI>
fir&s;t over all the Head, then on the Nape of
the Neck, the Legs and Arms, and e&s;pecially
on the Parts affected, and in the Intervals, or
when the Effects of the&s;e are pretty much
worn off; active warm Purges, e&s;pecially
of <HI>Hellebore</HI> and <HI>Sena,</HI> on a vinous <HI>Men&s;truum,</HI>
ought to be u&s;ed and repeated as often as the
Strength of the Patient will bear, with &s;ome
<HI>cordial</HI> Medicines, as that of Sir <HI>Walter
Raleigh, Electuarium de Sa&s;&s;afras,</HI> &amp;c. (at
Night, after the Operation is over) wa&s;h'd down
with a <HI>nervous Julep,</HI> mix'd with <HI>Volatile Spi|rits.</HI>
When the&s;e Evacuations have thus
been duly made, a Cour&s;e of <HI>Chalybeats,
Aromaticks</HI> and <HI>Bitters,</HI> is to be pre&s;crib'd,
to recruit the Strength of the Solids, and
<PB N="243" REF="279">
warm and active <HI>Oils</HI> and <HI>Ointments,</HI> e&s;pecially
the <HI>Opodeldoc:</HI> and &s;timulating Fomentations
applied to the Parts affected, they being fir&s;t
well curried with a <HI>Fle&s;h Bru&s;h. Cold Bath|ing</HI>
may be al&s;o tried on &s;ound Con&s;titutions,
but <HI>hot Bathing</HI> of any Sort or Kind, will, I
fear, be of little U&s;e, and may, in &s;ome deep
rooted Ca&s;es, do hurt by a temporary, at lea&s;t
greater Relaxation, unle&s;s the Juices be
extremely well thinn'd by <HI>ponderous</HI> Medi|cines
fir&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. IF the&s;e Medicines are duly and
effectually tried, under the Direction of a
proper Per&s;on, and with little or no Succe&s;s,
the Ca&s;e may be deem'd incurable. Not that
it is always mortal, for I have known them
la&s;t as many Years under a <HI>paralytick</HI> Stroke,
as under an Amputation, e&s;pecially if the
<HI>Pal&s;y</HI> had not followed after an <HI>Apoplectick,
Epileptick,</HI> or &s;ome &s;trong <HI>nervous</HI> Paroxy&s;m
or Fit: And even then, if the Con&s;titution
was tolerable, and the general Method of
Cure of <HI>nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers has been duly
and &s;teadily pur&s;ued, &s;eldom any thing
wor&s;e has happen'd from it than the Lo&s;s of
that Organ or Limb, which the Di&s;temper
had &s;eiz'd, and di&s;abled: Life in other
Re&s;pects, and under &s;uch a Management,
having gone on pretty tolerably.</P>

<P>&sect; I. THE <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> in its <HI>Fit</HI> and
<HI>Paroxy&s;m,</HI> is one of the mo&s;t
frightful and fatal Di&s;tempers
belonging to the <HI>nervous</HI> Cla&s;s of Di&s;ea&s;es,
few out-living the fir&s;t Fit, fewer the &s;econd,
and, as it is commonly &s;aid, none at all the

without Exceptions; for it is in this, as in

&s;trong and robu&s;t, and in whom the Cau&s;e
is but ju&s;t beginning to operate, and meets
with a greater Re&s;i&s;tance from the State of
the Solids, will hold it longer, and &s;truggle
more than the weak and tender. Few are
ever &s;eiz'd with this Di&s;temper, if it comes
naturally, and without an Accident, till
towards the <HI>Decline of Life,</HI> unle&s;s they
have been much troubled, with violent
and acute <HI>Head-aches,</HI> or Inflammations
upon the <HI>Brain,</HI> or its <HI>Membranes,</HI> or have
&s;ome inflammatory Di&s;temper tran&s;lated from

<HI>Gout, Rheumati&s;m, Ery&s;ipelas,</HI> and the like:
tho&s;e who are &s;eiz'd with a deep Stroak of
it, have &s;carce any Warning, but a &s;udden
violent <HI>Head-ach,</HI> a Sickne&s;s at the Stomach,

without Sen&s;e or Motion, and have &s;carce

<P>&sect; II. THERE are three kinds of <HI>Apoplexies</HI>
di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the different Cau&s;es that pro|duce
them; as <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> a <HI>Symptomatick Apoplexy,</HI>
&s;uch as I have mention'd, from a Tran&s;lation
of the <HI>Gout, Rheumati&s;m,</HI> &amp;c. 2<HI>dly,</HI> An
accidental one, from a <HI>Fall, Brui&s;e, Wound,</HI>

from an <HI>Apoplectick</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition or <HI>Di&s;|$ra&s;y,</HI>
proceeding from Intemperance and
<PB N="247" REF="283">
Exce&s;&s;es, Lazine&s;s, and Neglect of the <HI>Non|naturals</HI>
in Per&s;ons of the abovemention'd
particular Make and Con&s;titution of Body.
It is of this <HI>la&s;t</HI> chiefly that I intend to &s;ay
any thing here, the Treatment of the others
being obvious. As to the immediate <HI>Cau&s;e</HI>
of the <HI>Apoplectick Fit,</HI> I think it mu&s;t be one
of the&s;e two, <HI>viz.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Philo&s;oph. Tran&s;act. N&deg; 313.</NOTE> either a <HI>Rupture</HI> of the
Blood-Ve&s;&s;els in the <HI>Brain,</HI> whereby a great
Quantity of <HI>Blood</HI> being extrava&s;ated upon
its including <HI>Membranes,</HI> or into its Cavities,
pre&s;&s;es upon the <HI>Origin</HI> of the <HI>Nerves,</HI> &s;o as
to intercept their Operation and <HI>Functions,</HI>
from whence the mention'd Appearances may
be ea&s;ily deduc'd. And this may be either
occa&s;ion'd by a <HI>Fall,</HI> a <HI>Brui&s;e,</HI> a <HI>Wound,</HI> or
any other violent Accident upon the <HI>Skull,</HI>
or by too great a Quantity of <HI>Blood,</HI> or its
being overheated by &s;trong Liquors, violent
Exerci&s;e, or immoderate &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures,
in tho&s;e who have the Configuration I have
de&s;cribed. This &s;eems to be the Ca&s;e of
tho&s;e <HI>Apoplexies</HI> that happen in <HI>Southern
Countries,</HI> where, tho' the <HI>Climate</HI> confines
them to a very moderate <HI>Diet,</HI> yet as they
wallow in <HI>&s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures</HI> of another
Nature, and deal &s;ometimes pretty freely
with <HI>&s;pirituous</HI> Liquors, and <HI>Opiates</HI> (which
have the &s;ame <HI>deleterious</HI> Effects) the&s;e things
<PB N="248" REF="284">
in a &s;corching <HI>Climate,</HI> may kindle a Flame
in the Blood &s;ufficient to produce the&s;e men|tion'd
Effects.</P>
<P>&sect; III. THE other kind of <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> which
happens naturally, and is mo&s;t frequent in
<HI>Northern</HI> Countries and colder <HI>Climates,</HI>
&s;eems to ari&s;e chiefly from an <HI>Extrava&s;a|tion,</HI>
or rather <HI>Ouzing</HI> out thro' the Sides of
the relax'd and worn out Capillary Blood-Ve&s;&s;els,
of a thin <HI>putrid Serum,</HI> upon the
mention'd Parts, which I have hinted in the
former Ca&s;e. This chiefly happens to <HI>gro&s;s</HI>
and <HI>full Feeders,</HI> to tho&s;e who are too free
with &s;trong and <HI>&s;pirituous</HI> Liquors, and are
con&s;equently very unactive and lazy. I
have formerly &s;hewn how &s;uch a <HI>Cour&s;e</HI> and
<HI>Regimen</HI> will almo&s;t, or altogether, de&s;troy
the red or grumous Part of the <HI>Blood,</HI> and
turn the whole Ma&s;s of the Fluids into a
<HI>dirty Puddle</HI> of thin <HI>alcaline &s;alti&s;h Serum,</HI>
which Corrodes or <HI>Ouzes</HI> thro' the flabby
and relax'd Capillaries. That this is pretty
near the Truth, is evident from opening the
<HI>Heads</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Boneti Sepulchret. Anatom. Lib. I.</NOTE> of tho&s;e who have died of a natural
<HI>Apoplexy,</HI> the Cavities of the Brain having
been found generally quite filled, either
with <HI>extrava&s;ated Blood,</HI> or &s;uch a <HI>Serum,</HI>
as I have mention'd. Tho&s;e who want fur|ther
<PB N="249" REF="285">
Light in this Affair may con&s;ult <HI>Wep&s;er.</HI>
The milde&s;t apoplectick Fits, of all, where
the Patient e&s;capes for once or twice, &s;eem
to ari&s;e only from an Ob&s;truction or <HI>Tume|faction</HI>
of the Blood-Ve&s;&s;els, or <HI>Glands</HI> in the
Cavity of the <HI>Skull,</HI> upon the Removal of
which Ob&s;truction, by the Struggle and Effort
of Nature, in the <HI>Paroxy&s;m,</HI> it cea&s;es. This
Degree is what &s;eems only capable of be|ing
cured; but if it is &s;uffer'd to go on
without any effectual Method, us'd to re|move
the <HI>apoplectick</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition by rectifying
the Juices, two or three more &s;uch <HI>Pa|roxy&s;ms</HI>
bur&s;t the Ve&s;&s;els, and bring on the
incurable Kinds mention'd.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. IF the Account here given of this
terrible Di&s;temper be ju&s;t, there will be no
Difficulty in forming the true <HI>Indications,</HI>
and the mo&s;t effectual Method of <HI>Cure,</HI> as
far as it is po&s;&s;ible. Which of the&s;e Cau&s;es
have the Prevalency in a particular Ca&s;e,
will be evident, from the Manner of Life,
the Age and Con&s;titution of the Patient, and
the Symptoms of the <HI>Fit.</HI> There is very
little Hope of Succe&s;s in either Ca&s;e, unle&s;s
the Cau&s;e be but ju&s;t beginning and very
weak; or the Per&s;on very &s;trong and young,
and otherwi&s;e &s;ound. To rouze them out
of the pre&s;ent Fit; in the <HI>fir&s;t Ca&s;e,</HI> the
mo&s;t plentiful <HI>Bleeding</HI> that can po&s;&s;ibly be
ventur'd upon, is to be attempted at the
<PB N="250" REF="286">
Arm, in the <HI>temporal</HI> Artery, or the <HI>jugu|lar</HI>
Vein, in the Foot, and by Cupping
on the Nape of the Neck, together with
&s;harp, cooling and acid <HI>Gly&s;ters,</HI> while
Bli&s;ters are laid on in every Place where
they can conveniently be. In tho&s;e <HI>Fits</HI>
produced by &s;uch a <HI>Serum</HI> as I have
mention'd, or from an Ob&s;truction in the
<HI>Glands, Vomits</HI> are al&s;o immediately to be
forc'd down, (but avoided in tho&s;e occa|&s;ion'd
by a <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> becau&s;e in
this la&s;t, the great Affair is to &s;top the
Violence of the <HI>Haemorrhage,</HI> and to
draw it off by all po&s;&s;ible Means from
the <HI>Brain</HI>): And Care is likewi&s;e to be
taken, neither by inward Medicines nor
outward Application, to increa&s;e the Hurry,
Heat, or <HI>Inflammation</HI> of the Blood: and
therefore the Solids are not to be &s;timu|lated
to too violent Efforts. Whereas, in
the <HI>other Ca&s;e,</HI> neither of the&s;e can be
done too much: and therefore, not only
&s;harp <HI>Sternutatories, foetid Smells,</HI> and <HI>vola|tile

but (other Things not &s;ucceeding) even
actual <HI>Cauteries</HI> are to be applied to the
Soles of the Feet, and Crown of the Head,

&sect; V. AS to the <HI>Apoplectick</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition,
in tho&s;e of the inflammatory Kind, all pro|per
Means are to be u&s;ed that tend to cool
the Blood, and allay its <HI>Fermentation</HI> and
Heat, &s;uch as <HI>Acids, acidulated</HI> Draughts,
mild <HI>Bal&s;amicks,</HI> gentle <HI>Catharticks,</HI> with an
extremely cool, moderate, and &s;pare <HI>Diet,</HI>
ab&s;taining from violent Exerci&s;e, and every
thing that may heat and inflame the Blood.
The other <HI>Apoplectick</HI> Di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t be
treated much after the &s;ame Manner, with
this Difference only, that the Medicines mu&s;t
be &s;tronger and warmer, the Exerci&s;e greater
and more con&s;tant, that continual Drains, by
<HI>Bli&s;ters, I&s;&s;ues, Setons,</HI> and the like, be &s;et a
going, and that the <HI>Diet</HI> be &s;omewhat
higher in Quality, tho' not in Quantity, and
the other general Methods for the Cure of
the <HI>Nervous</HI> Symptoms that &s;ucceed upon it,
be pur&s;ued according to the Directions for|merly
given.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. NEXT to the <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> the <HI>Epi|lep&s;y</HI>
is the mo&s;t dangerous, terrible, and
di&s;heartening Di&s;temper that belongs to the
<HI>Nervous</HI> or <HI>cold</HI> Cla&s;s of Di&s;ea&s;es; &s;eldom
any, or, at lea&s;t very few, e&s;cape from it,
unle&s;s they be otherwi&s;e very &s;trong and
vigorous, without a Stroke of an <HI>Apoplexy,</HI>
which generally ends their Lives: a <HI>partial</HI> or
<HI>half-Body Pal&s;y,</HI> or a total Demolition of the
<PB N="252" REF="288">
<HI>Intellectual Faculties.</HI> Young Children, well
treated, may be recovered, and get &s;trong
and lu&s;ty, by &s;tronger <HI>Do&s;es,</HI> and a longer
Cour&s;e of the &s;ame Medicines and Methods
I have advi&s;ed for their <HI>Convul&s;ive</HI> Fits. The
Symptoms that attend grown Per&s;ons are,
their <HI>dropping down</HI> &s;uddenly, as if &s;hot; but
&s;ometimes with violent <HI>Convul&s;ions</HI> and
<HI>Throws</HI> in the <HI>Belly, Brea&s;t,</HI> and <HI>Limbs;</HI>
beating and tearing them&s;elves, <HI>clinching</HI>
their <HI>Fi&s;ts, biting</HI> their <HI>Tongues, grinding</HI>
their <HI>Teeth,</HI> and <HI>foaming</HI> at the Mouth, with
a &s;mall <HI>Trembling, unequal</HI> and &s;ometimes
<HI>interrupted Pul&s;e,</HI> and an involuntary Secre|tion
of all the natural Di&s;charges: having
&s;carce any Sen&s;e or Knowledge of what they
do, or what is done to them: but the mo&s;t
dangerous of all, are their violent <HI>Convul&s;ions</HI>
and involuntary Motions, by which they
would tear, brui&s;e, and de&s;troy them&s;elves,
if not with-held: the <HI>Fit</HI> generally terminates
in a Do&s;ing or <HI>Lethargy,</HI> which continues
longer or &s;horter, according to the Violence
of the <HI>Paroxy&s;m,</HI> and then by Degrees their
Spirits and Strength return, tho' with a
greater Degree of Lowne&s;s and Confu&s;ion,
or Stupidity. This Di&s;temper &s;ometimes
follows the Periods of the<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Vide Mead de Imperio Solis &amp; Lunae.</NOTE> <HI>Luminaries,</HI>
e&s;pecially their <HI>Conjunctions</HI> and <HI>Oppo&s;itions;</HI>
<PB N="253" REF="289">
but this is uncertain, and in &s;ome Ca&s;es
only, as all <HI>Periods</HI> are in our incon&s;tant
<HI>Climate.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; VII. FROM this Account of the Symp|toms
of this Di&s;temper, I think it is pretty
evident, that it differs very little, or not at
all, or at mo&s;t, in a few Circum&s;tances only,
from <HI>Hypochondriacal</HI> and <HI>Hy&s;terick Fits:</HI>
which la&s;t, when violent, terminate always
in the&s;e <HI>Epileptick</HI> Fits, as they, on the
other Hand, when they become weak,
dwindle into the <HI>Hy&s;terick</HI> Kind: So that
having treated of the&s;e la&s;t &s;o fully, it will
be needle&s;s to &s;ay any thing further about
the&s;e others; only this, that the Diet mu&s;t
be much more &s;trict, cool, and moderate,
and the Medicines &s;tronger and oftner re|peated,
e&s;pecially <HI>Vomits, Steel,</HI> and <HI>Bitters.</HI>
Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> of <HI>Croydon</HI> cured him&s;elf intirely
and ab&s;olutely, of the mo&s;t violent, con&s;tant,
and habitual <HI>Epilep&s;y</HI> that perhaps ever was
known, after having, in vain, tried all the
Methods and Medicines advi&s;ed by the mo&s;t
eminent <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> of his Time, by a <HI>total
Diet of Milk,</HI> without Bread, or any other
Vegetable, or any thing (be&s;ides a Spoonful
of compound <HI>Peony Water</HI> &s;ometimes, to
prevent its Curdling) confining him&s;elf to a
<HI>Pint</HI> in a Morning, a <HI>Quart</HI> at Noon, and a
<HI>Pint</HI> at Night, of the Milk of <HI>Gra&s;s-fed</HI>
<PB N="254" REF="290">
Cows in the <HI>Summer,</HI> and of tho&s;e fed with
<HI>Hay</HI> in the <HI>Winter,</HI> the <HI>Milk</HI> of Cows fed
with <HI>Grains</HI> always inflating him, and lying
unea&s;y on his Stomach. He had continued
in perfect Health and Vigour (having had
&s;everal Children) &s;eventeen Years when I &s;aw
him, and received this Account from him,
in&s;omuch that he could have play'd four or
five Hours at <HI>Cricket,</HI> on <HI>Ban&s;tead Downs,</HI>
without Wearine&s;s or profu&s;e Sweating, and
probably might have continued many Years
longer in perfect Health (as he did &s;even or
eight Years more) had he not entered upon
a different <HI>Regimen of Diet</HI> (as I am in|formed
&s;ince I fir&s;t wrote this Hi&s;tory, in
my <HI>Treati&s;e of the Gout,</HI> by a Per&s;on of
great Credit) and come to eat <HI>Animal Food,</HI>
by which, in a <HI>&s;hort</HI> Time, he was de&s;troyed.
Some others have been cured by me, by a
<HI>Regimen of Diet</HI> le&s;s &s;trict, and the Medi|cines
already &s;ugge&s;ted; but I believe none
ever were cured who have been come to
<HI>Maturity,</HI> without a very exact <HI>low Regimen,</HI>
continued during all their Lives, the tran&s;|gre&s;&s;ing
it for any long time, always bring|ing
their Di&s;orders back, if not &s;omething
wor&s;e: and I believe a total Milk, and
Vegetable Diet, as ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for
the total Cure of the <HI>Epilep&s;y,</HI> as it is for the
<HI>Gout</HI> or a <HI>Con&s;umption.</HI> Here were the pro|per
Place to &s;ay &s;omething of <HI>Lunacy</HI> and
<HI>Madne&s;s,</HI> being &s;atisfied that the Methods
<PB N="255" REF="291">
here laid down are &s;ufficient, and the mo&s;t
effectual for the&s;e Di&s;tempers; but de&s;igning
this principally for common intelligent
Readers, and tho&s;e who &s;uffer under <HI>Nervous</HI>
Di&s;tempers, tho' not regularly bred to the
Practice of <HI>Phy&s;ick:</HI> and People under the&s;e
mentioned Di&s;tempers being incapable of
Reading, or at lea&s;t, of &s;erious and clo&s;e
Application, and the&s;e Di&s;orders being the
Province of particular <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI> or tho&s;e

<HEAD>ADVERTISEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS La&s;t, has been by far
the mo&s;t difficult and un|plea&s;ant
Part <HI>of my Work.
The obvious</HI> Sneer <HI>of its
being a</HI> Quack's Bill, <HI>has been the lea&s;t
Part of that Difficulty; for when I &s;et
about fini&s;hing this Work, for the Be|nefit
of the Sedentary, Tender and De|cay'd,
I made a</HI> Sacrifice <HI>of &s;ome part of
my Vanity and Intere&s;t. But among
the very many In&s;tances I could have
adduced, I was obliged to lay a&s;ide all
tho&s;e who&s;e</HI> Ca&s;es <HI>were pretty much
alike, and to pick out &s;uch only, as
<PB N="260" REF="294">
&s;eem'd to me, to be more particular,
or which were mo&s;t proper to illu&s;|trate
and confirm the &s;everal Steps
of the preceding Doctrine, and to
direct the</HI> Valetudinarian, <HI>in the le&s;s
obvious and uncommon Symptoms. But
that which di&s;tre&s;s'd me mo&s;t, was, the</HI>
Names <HI>of the Per&s;ons, who&s;e</HI> Ca&s;es <HI>I
was oblig'd to mention, mo&s;t of them
being &s;till</HI> alive, <HI>and few caring to be
made</HI> Examples <HI>of in any Re&s;pect. The</HI>
Di&s;tempers of Patients are &s;acred, (Res
&s;acra mi&s;er) <HI>and</HI> nervous <HI>Di&s;tempers
e&s;pecially, are under &s;ome Kind of</HI>
Di&s;grace <HI>and</HI> Imputation, <HI>in the Opi|nion
of the</HI> Vulgar <HI>and</HI> Unlearned;
<HI>they pa&s;s among the Multitude, for
a lower Degree of</HI> Lunacy, <HI>and the
fir&s;t Step towards a</HI> di&s;temper'd Brain:
<HI>and the be&s;t Con&s;truction is</HI> Whim, Ill-Humour,
Peevi&s;hne&s;s <HI>or</HI> Particularity;
<HI>and in the</HI> Sex, Daintine&s;s, Fanta&s;tical|ne&s;s
<HI>or</HI> Coquetry. <HI>So that often when I
have been con&s;ulted in a Ca&s;e, before I
<PB N="261" REF="295">
was acquainted with the</HI> Character
<HI>and Temper of the Patient, and
found it to be what is commonly
call'd</HI> Nervous, <HI>I have been in the
utmo&s;t Difficulty, when de&s;ir'd to
define or name the Di&s;temper, for
fear of affronting them, or fixing a
Reproach on a</HI> Family <HI>or</HI> Per&s;on.
<HI>If I call'd the Ca&s;e</HI> Glandular <HI>with</HI>
nervous <HI>Symptoms, they concluded I
thought them</HI> pox'd, <HI>or had the</HI> King's-Evil.
<HI>If I &s;aid it was</HI> Vapours, Hy&s;te|rick
<HI>or</HI> Hypochondriacal <HI>Di&s;orders, they
thought I call'd them</HI> Mad <HI>or</HI> Fan|ta&s;tical:
<HI>and if they were &s;uch as
valued them&s;elves, on fearing neither</HI>
God <HI>nor</HI> Devil, <HI>I was in Ha|zard
of a</HI> Drubbing <HI>for &s;eeming to
impeach their Courage: and was
thought as rude, as if I had given
them the</HI> Lye; <HI>and even the very
be&s;t has been, I my&s;elf was thought
a Fool, a weak and ignorant Cox|comb,
and perhaps di&s;mi&s;s'd in Scorn;
<PB N="262" REF="296">
and &s;ome I have actually lo&s;t by it.
Notwith&s;tanding all this, the Di&s;|ea&s;e
is as much a bodily Di&s;tem|per
(as I have demon&s;trated) as the</HI>
Small-Pox <HI>or a</HI> Fever; <HI>and the
Truth is, it &s;eldom, and I think
never happens or can happen, to any
but tho&s;e of the livelie&s;t and quicke&s;t
natural Parts, who&s;e Faculties are
the brighte&s;t and mo&s;t &s;piritual, and
who&s;e Genius is mo&s;t keen and pe|netrating,
and particularly where
there is the mo&s;t delicate Sen&s;ation
and Ta&s;te, both of Plea&s;ure and
Pain. So equally are the good and
bad Things of this mortal State di|&s;tributed!
For I &s;eldom ever ob&s;erv'd a</HI>
heavy, dull, earthy, clod-pated Clown,
<HI>much troubled with</HI> nervous <HI>Di&s;orders,
or at lea&s;t, not to any eminent Degree;
and I &s;carce believe the Thing po&s;&s;i|ble,
from the</HI> animal Oeconomy <HI>and
the pre&s;ent Laws of Nature.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="297">
BUT <HI>be&s;ides this, when I was
determin'd to publi&s;h this Work, the
Per&s;ons who&s;e</HI> Ca&s;es <HI>I had pick'd
out for my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, were
all &s;catter'd and at great Di&s;tances
from me, &s;ome being in other</HI> King|doms
<HI>and</HI> foreign Parts, <HI>and mo&s;t of
them were in &s;uch Circum&s;tances and
Situation, that it was by no means
convenient or proper to publi&s;h, their</HI>
Names <HI>without Leave; and I was un|willing
to put my</HI> Friends <HI>and</HI> Patients
<HI>to the Pain, either of a Con&s;ent or Re|fu&s;al,
and re&s;olved even to bear the
Slur of</HI> Forgery, <HI>and let the Whole
re&s;t on my own Credit, rather than
contend with &s;uch Difficulties. I have
therefore mentioned their</HI> Names, <HI>only
in tho&s;e Ca&s;es where I was ab&s;olutely at
Liberty; but &s;olemnly declare, that the
others were &s;uch</HI> in the main, <HI>as I have
repre&s;ented them; and in any particular</HI>
Ca&s;e, <HI>if called upon, I am ready to
a&s;&s;ign the</HI> Per&s;on, <HI>under proper Con|ditions,
<PB N="264" REF="298">
and have always de&s;crib'd the</HI>
Ca&s;e <HI>from the</HI> Name <HI>and</HI> Character <HI>of
the</HI> Patient, <HI>and the</HI> Hi&s;tory <HI>of the
Di&s;temper placed before my Eyes.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE <HI>cla&s;&s;ed the</HI> Ca&s;es, <HI>as I
had done the &s;everal Stages of this
Di&s;temper in the</HI> former Part, <HI>viz.
into the</HI> three <HI>different Orders. The</HI>
fir&s;t Cla&s;s <HI>and</HI> Chapter <HI>contains Ex|amples
of tho&s;e who&s;e</HI> nervous <HI>Di&s;|orders
being chiefly confin'd to the</HI>
alimentary Tube, <HI>the Juices being
tolerably &s;ound and good, and the Solids
pretty firm, a Regulation only of com|mon
Diet, as to Quantity and Qua|lity,
and a general Cour&s;e of</HI> ner|vous
<HI>Evacuants, for Prevention, and</HI>
Volatiles <HI>on</HI> Paroxy&s;ms, <HI>has been &s;uf|ficient.
The</HI> &s;econd Cla&s;s <HI>and</HI> Chap|ter
<HI>contains In&s;tances of tho&s;e who&s;e</HI>
Ca&s;es <HI>being deeper and more ob&s;ti|nate,
where the Juices have been
either</HI> &s;izy, thick <HI>or</HI> inflam'd, <HI>or
<PB N="265" REF="299">
&s;ome noble</HI> Organ <HI>beginning to be
&s;poil'd: more powerful</HI> Evacuants <HI>and</HI>
Alteratives, <HI>e&s;pecially of the</HI> ponde|rous
<HI>Medicines, have been nece&s;&s;ary;
and a</HI> trimming <HI>middling Diet, of</HI>
alternate <HI>Days of young tender Fle&s;h
Meat, and Milk and Vegetables, with
Wine and Water for Drink, were
requir'd. The</HI> la&s;t Cla&s;s <HI>and</HI> third
Chapter <HI>is of &s;uch, where the Ca&s;e
being almo&s;t incurable otherwi&s;e, ex|tremely
frightful and painful, from
&s;ome of the nece&s;&s;ary</HI> Organs <HI>vi&s;ibly
&s;poil'd and decay'd, and the Juices verge|ing
towards</HI> Putrefaction: <HI>the &s;trong|e&s;t</HI>
Evacuants <HI>and</HI> Alteratives, <HI>with a</HI>
total Milk and Vegetable Diet, <HI>long
per&s;i&s;ted in, was indi&s;pen&s;ably nece&s;&s;ary.
The Medicines I have only</HI> hinted <HI>at,
to prevent the</HI> Quacking <HI>of Patients
them&s;elves, but have pointed them out
&s;o clearly, in General, that no Body
of common Sen&s;e and liberal Educa|tion

that none but a regularly-bred</HI> Phy|&s;ician

preventive or extirpative ones. It

<P>A <HI>Gentleman</HI> of <HI>Scotland,</HI> of an <HI>Antient</HI>
and <HI>Honourable</HI> Family, loving, and be|lov'd
of, all Mankind, was early in Life
&s;ubject to <HI>Nervous</HI> Di&s;orders, which, tho'
univer&s;al, did chiefly affect his <HI>Auditory Or|gans,</HI>
&s;o as to impair his Hearing. For this
he had try'd a great many <HI>Active</HI> and <HI>Dan|gerous</HI>
Remedies, which, I think, had damag'd
an otherwi&s;e naturally clean and firm Con&s;ti|tution.
After having &s;erv'd his Country long
in eminent Employments, he was &s;eiz'd,
about the Sixty-&s;eventh Year of his Age,
with <HI>Nervous, Hypochondriacal,</HI> and <HI>Convul|&s;ive
Fits</HI> and <HI>Paroxy&s;ms,</HI> the mo&s;t &s;evere,
terrible, and ob&s;tinate that I had ever &s;een.
At fir&s;t, they return'd three or four times

tho' all the Time his <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> and <HI>Fa|culties</HI>

for the Space of almo&s;t two Years: The

<HI>Ipecacuhana</HI> Vomits mix'd, which always
weaken'd or &s;top'd the <HI>Fits,</HI> (the Ca&s;e, in
my Opinion, being chiefly an ob&s;tructed
<HI>&s;chirrous Liver</HI>) with <HI>Calomel</HI> Purges, <HI>Gum</HI>

and &s;ometimes <HI>Foetids</HI> and <HI>Volatiles,</HI> only as
a pre&s;ent Relief. The&s;e were the principal
Remedies which reliev'd, and, at la&s;t, cur'd
him; but what chiefly accompli&s;h'd the Cure,
was that (of his own Accord, I not daring
to offer &s;uch an Advice to one who was &s;o far
advanc'd in Life) he enter'd into a <HI>Trimming
Diet,</HI> chiefly of <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> with weak

twenty-four Hours, in&s;omuch that ignorant
People thought it <HI>Witchcraft</HI> and <HI>Inchant|ment.</HI>
Various <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Antihy&s;terical</HI>
Medicines had been pre&s;crib'd by the <HI>Phy|&s;ician</HI>
in Ordinary at <HI>London,</HI> which had
reliev'd and eas'd her for a Time, but &s;till
&s;he relaps'd in a Month or two; and <HI>Ride|ing,
Country Air,</HI> and even Changes of that
<HI>Air</HI> were try'd with little or no Succe&s;s.
At la&s;t, her Parents being under the greate&s;t
Concern about her, and fearing le&s;t her Fa|culties
(which were above <HI>Mediocrity</HI>) might
be impair'd by &s;o tedious and unaccountable

with an ab&s;olute Power to do by her, both in
<HI>Diet</HI> and <HI>Medicines,</HI> as I &s;hould think be&s;t.
I fir&s;t try'd all the common <HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>An|tihy&s;terical</HI>

and a con&s;tant Cour&s;e of <HI>Cinnabar,</HI> fre&s;h

was perfectly cured of all her Complaints,

<HEAD>CASE II.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Young Lady</HI> of an Honourable and Opu|lent

Merit, and the fine&s;t Parts I ever knew in
the Sex, had from her <HI>Parents</HI> inhe|rited
<PB N="287" REF="321">
<HI>weak Nerves,</HI> which, for want of
due Care and proper Management, brought
on at la&s;t the mo&s;t violent, extreme, and
ob&s;tinate <HI>Nervous Paroxy&s;ms,</HI> (with their
whole Circle of <HI>Symptoms</HI>) I had ever &s;een.
She had been naturally of a <HI>thin Habit,</HI> but
of a &s;udden had grown exce&s;&s;ively Fat; and
had had often Threatnings, and &s;ometimes
pretty long Seizures of the &s;ame Cla&s;s of Di&s;|orders
before; which from time to time other
Phy&s;icians, and often I, had cured by the com|mon
Medicines, <HI>viz. Vomits, Volatiles, Cha|lybeats,
Bitters, Pyrmont and Bath Waters,</HI>
with gentle <HI>Evacuations.</HI> But at la&s;t all
the&s;e <HI>Nervous Symptoms</HI> became &s;o extremely
ob&s;tinate, frightful, and painful, that nei|ther
I, nor any other of her <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> (of
whom &s;he had con&s;ulted many) could pro|cure
her any la&s;ting Reprieve. She came
at la&s;t to <HI>Bath,</HI> where I had often had the
Honour to direct her, and the re&s;t of the
Family for many Years; the Waters with
<HI>Quinquinated Bitters,</HI> and <HI>Pilul. Gummo&s;.
cum Aloe lot&acirc;,</HI> at fir&s;t gave her the mo&s;t &s;en|&s;ible
and longe&s;t Relief, but at la&s;t they
fail'd al&s;o. I afterwards try'd the greate&s;t
and mo&s;t exten&s;ive Variety of <HI>Nervous</HI> Me|dicines,
I had ever us'd in any &s;uch Ca&s;e,
&s;ince I fir&s;t practi&s;ed Phy&s;ick. I try'd over
and over all the Tribe of the <HI>Nervous, An|tihy&s;terical,</HI>
and <HI>De-ob&s;truent</HI> Medicines,
<PB N="288" REF="322">
<HI>Bitters, Volatiles, Chalybeats, Foetids, Al|teratives;</HI>
all Kinds of <HI>Evacuations,</HI> (as
<HI>Bleeding, Bli&s;tering, Vomiting</HI> again and
again) together with the <HI>Ponderous, Mineral</HI>
and <HI>Mercurial</HI> Medicines of all the proper
Preparations, and at la&s;t even <HI>Opiates</HI> them|&s;elves,
combined with all the <HI>Antihy&s;tericks:</HI>
Indeed every thing I had ever u&s;ed, heard of,
or read in approv'd Authors, and each of the&s;e
for a Time &s;ufficient for Trial. Notwith|&s;tanding
all this, her torturing <HI>Headachs,</HI>
her con&s;tant <HI>&s;creaming Fits, burning Heats,
&s;leeple&s;s Nights, Terrors,</HI> and other inex|pre&s;&s;ible
Sufferings, were intolerable and in|&s;upportable.
I was in the utmo&s;t Concern
and Anxiety about her, and knew not what
Hand to turn me: for tho' other <HI>Phy&s;i|cians</HI>
had been join'd, yet, I having been
hitherto always &s;ucce&s;sful in the Family, they
did me the Honour to place a particular
Confidence in me, and I was as heartily and
warmly de&s;irous of &s;erving them &s;ucce&s;sful|ly.
At la&s;t (after above a Year &s;pent un|der
this Method and the&s;e Medicines) I
told them and her, that I had but one
thing more to propo&s;e, which I had done
long before, but that &s;he had been often
and &s;trongly caution'd and warn'd again&s;t
it, and I was afraid neither &s;he nor her
Friends would willingly come into it, after
&s;o many, &s;o weighty Remon&s;trances a|gain&s;t
it, and from tho&s;e who&s;e Duty it
<PB N="289" REF="323">
was to direct her, &s;o that I was willing to have
effected the Cure by the common Means and
Medicines, but found they would not do;
and therefore I told her at la&s;t plainly,
that the only Hopes of her Recovery was
from a total <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Diet, and
Ab&s;tinence from all fermented Liquors, but
as a <HI>Cordial.</HI> I met indeed with a readier
Compliance on all &s;ides than I had expected;
and accordingly the <HI>Lady</HI> went chearfully
into a total <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Diet, and in
le&s;s than three Months &s;he was much better,
in &s;ix Months tolerably well, and in nine
Months almo&s;t perfectly well; this chiefly
by her cool Diet, for after &s;he enter'd upon
it, &s;he had occa&s;ion to take very few Me|dicines,
&s;o that &s;he went away with no
other Directions, but the Continuance of
<HI>gentle Vomits</HI> when required, <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Wa|ters
for her common Drink, and Per&s;eve|rance
in her <HI>Diet:</HI> with the <HI>Gum and Aloe|tick
Pills</HI> on tran&s;ient Di&s;orders. The <HI>pon|derous</HI>
Medicines &s;he had long taken at fir&s;t,
had made the <HI>Liver</HI> pervious, (which had
been evidently ob&s;tructed before,) &s;o that
there was con&s;tantly <HI>Choler</HI> poured out into
the Stomach for a long Time after, which made
<HI>Vomits</HI> &s;ometimes nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;charge it.
I hear &s;he continues extremely well, without
any means but her <HI>Diet</HI> and the&s;e few
Medicines on Occa&s;ions with Exerci&s;e, and
grows more hardy, active, and chearful, as
<PB N="290" REF="324">

<HEAD>CASE III.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Gentleman of Fortune,</HI> and an <HI>Officer</HI> of
<HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> in the <HI>Army,</HI> was afflicted with
the mo&s;t painful and frightful <HI>Colicks</HI> I had
ever known, which often terminated in <HI>Epi|leptick
Fits.</HI> Some of his Family, about the
&s;ame Time (<HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Meridian</HI>) of Life, had
died of the &s;ame Sort of <HI>convul&s;ive</HI> and <HI>ner|vous
Colick,</HI> which had ju&s;tly made him the
more cautious and careful. He came here
to <HI>Bath,</HI> to put him&s;elf under my Di|rection:
I at fir&s;t try'd with the Waters,
all the common <HI>Nervous</HI> Medicines, as <HI>Quin|quinated
Bitters, Volatiles, Foetids,</HI> and <HI>Al|teratives</HI>
of the <HI>mineral</HI> Tribe of all
Kinds, and in all the Shapes I could con|trive;
be&s;ides con&s;tant riding, on <HI>Chalybeats</HI>
(which always makes them more effec|tual)
but all without Succe&s;s: So that
I have often &s;een him rolling on the
Ground in <HI>Agonies,</HI> crying out to put an
End to his Pains any how. Nothing gave
him Ea&s;e, except great Do&s;es of warm
<HI>Opiats</HI> in &s;trong <HI>Nervous Cordials,</HI> and
they always left him di&s;pirited, low, and
re&s;tle&s;s, even to Extremity. I was willing
to try every thing fir&s;t, before I propo|&s;ed
the <HI>la&s;t Remedy;</HI> for I never found
<PB N="291" REF="325">
any one would come into it, till their
Sufferings were <HI>extreme,</HI> and that they
found nothing el&s;e would do, and &s;o were
brought to be willing to purcha&s;e Ea&s;e at
any Rate. <HI>Gold may be bought too dear;</HI> and
as long as <HI>common Remedies,</HI> and <HI>common
Life</HI> will do, I own, it is not rea&s;onable to
expect that any &s;hould &s;ubmit to <HI>uncommon
and extraordinary Methods. Dying</HI> alone, is
not &s;o terrible to an hone&s;t and good Man;
tho' all the <HI>Bounces</HI> about it, I have &s;ome|times
heard, &s;eem really <HI>unnatural,</HI> and pa&s;s
with me for nothing; the <HI>Author</HI> of our
<HI>Nature</HI> has wi&s;ely implanted the <HI>Terror of
Death</HI> in us, to &s;upport our Endeavours of
living under the many Mi&s;eries and Misfor|tunes
of our pre&s;ent Impri&s;onment; the only
Misfortune is, when we come too late in the
Application of this <HI>la&s;t Remedy,</HI> and the
Time is elaps'd for a perfect Recovery.
This <HI>Gentleman,</HI> being one of finely <HI>cultiva|ted
Parts,</HI> as well as of good, &s;ound natural
Sen&s;e, comply'd more readily than I expected
from a Gentleman of his <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion:</HI> when I
propos'd a <HI>Milk and Vegetable Diet,</HI> as the
<HI>&s;ole Means</HI> left for his total Recovery from
all his Complaints, and for a firm State of
future Health. When he enter'd upon it at
fir&s;t, his <HI>Appetite</HI> was quite gone, &s;o that
he lived in it for &s;ome time on the lea&s;t I ever
knew a Man do. I have known him pa&s;s
<HI>many Weeks,</HI> and <HI>&s;ome Months,</HI> with a little
<PB N="292" REF="326">
<HI>Bohea Tea,</HI> and a &s;mall Cup of <HI>Milk,</HI> with
about half a Penny Roll, without Butter, for
<HI>Breakfa&s;t:</HI> and about a <HI>Pint</HI> of boil'd Milk,
with &s;carce a whole <HI>Roll</HI> for <HI>Dinner;</HI> and
his <HI>Supper</HI> (if any) was two or three Spoon|fuls
of <HI>Honey</HI> boil'd and skim'd in a <HI>Pint</HI> of
Water, with a Slice or two of a <HI>Penny Roll</HI>
toa&s;ted; and he told me, he found <HI>Honey</HI>
thus boil'd in Water, and thus <HI>skim'd</HI> and
<HI>defaecated,</HI> one of the mo&s;t <HI>heartening</HI> and
enlivening Meals he could then take; and
certainly this is an excellent Method to take
off the <HI>Rawne&s;s, Crudity,</HI> and <HI>Colicking</HI>
Quality of <HI>Honey,</HI> which being a Kind of Na|tural
Bal&s;am or <HI>in&s;pi&s;&s;ated Juice</HI> of the Meal
of young <HI>Vegetables</HI> on the <HI>Blo&s;&s;oms of Plants;</HI>
is con&s;equently, when thus boil'd, skim'd,
and diluted, a mo&s;t excellent tender Food
for weak Stomachs. After pa&s;&s;ing a <HI>Winter</HI>
at <HI>Bath,</HI> to inure him to this <HI>Regimen,</HI> re|peating
<HI>Vomits</HI> and <HI>warm Opiats</HI> on <HI>Pa|roxy&s;ms,</HI>
Rideing, and Drinking the <HI>Bath</HI>-Waters,
I &s;ent him through the <HI>South of

Way of Temptation, and an <HI>ingenious, well-educated
Gentleman,</HI> he pa&s;&s;ed his Time both
agreeably and u&s;efully; and after about two
Years &s;tay, he brought Home with him a
&s;ound, firm <HI>Vegetable</HI> Con&s;titution, and a

<P>A <HI>Gentleman of Wales,</HI> of &s;trong <HI>natural

with that Di&s;order, which in a few Years
ro&s;e to &s;uch Height, that he was almo&s;t con|&s;tantly
confined to his Bed by it, at lea&s;t for
<HI>eight</HI> or <HI>ten</HI> Months in the Year; and when
his <HI>Hands, Feet, Knees, Hips</HI> or <HI>Shoul|der
Joints</HI> were not affected, it was in his
<HI>Head, Stomach,</HI> or <HI>Bowels,</HI> &s;o that he had
no Ea&s;e but from pouring down con&s;tantly
great <HI>Do&s;es</HI> of &s;trong <HI>Wines, Drams,</HI> or
<HI>Cordials.</HI> Thus wearied out, crippled, and
crucified, he came here to <HI>Bath,</HI> to be un|der
my Direction; ready and willing to &s;ub|mit
to any <HI>Di&s;cipline</HI> or <HI>Self-denial</HI> I &s;hould
pre&s;cribe, to get, at lea&s;t Ea&s;e, if not rid, of
&s;o tormenting a Di&s;temper. As he was in
this Di&s;po&s;ition, I put him immediately on a
<HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI> (it being in Summer, and he
then in his <HI>lucid Interval.</HI>) Be&s;ides the <HI>Diet,</HI>
I gave him a medicated opening Wine, with
<HI>Rhubarb, Quinquina, Aromaticks</HI> and <HI>Bitters;</HI>
(or a Kind of <HI>Lower's Tincture,</HI> without <HI>Steel</HI>)
this, with the Waters, I de&s;igned &s;hould
clean&s;e the <HI>Primae Viae</HI> throughly, and le&s;&s;en
the Quantity and <HI>Acrimony</HI> of the <HI>Arthritick
<PB N="294" REF="328">
Salts</HI> by degrees. He continued here four or
five Months, drinking the Waters, and u&s;eing
this Medicine, by which his next <HI>Fit</HI> was le&s;s
painful and dureable; and he has kept to this
<HI>Regimen,</HI> and the&s;e Medicines, under &s;ome
Form or other, at times, ever &s;ince. In the <HI>Fit</HI>
I ordered him to drink plentifully of <HI>&s;mall
Sack Whey</HI> or <HI>Sage Po&s;&s;et,</HI> with <HI>Hart&s;horn</HI>
Drops, and to live mo&s;tly on the Seed and
Meal Meats then, (as <HI>Bread, Pudding, Water-Gruel,
Panada, Rice,</HI> and <HI>Sago,</HI> with or
without Milk;) in the <HI>Intervals</HI> of the <HI>Fits,</HI>
on <HI>Milk, Fruit, Roots,</HI> and <HI>Herbs,</HI> and to
take often the <HI>medicated Wine</HI> I have men|tioned,
and on Occa&s;ions the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters,
with the con&s;tant U&s;e of the <HI>Fle&s;h Bru&s;h.</HI>
By this Method he has not only recovered
the U&s;e of his Limbs in a great Degree, and
in the long Intervals, is as <HI>light&s;ome, chearful,</HI>
and <HI>happy</HI> as any Man can be, after having
been &s;o long <HI>crippled</HI> by &s;o violent <HI>Hereditary</HI>
a Di&s;temper. His <HI>Fits</HI> are with very mode|rate
Pain and little <HI>Inflammation,</HI> and their
coming on and going off, is with little or no
Sickne&s;s. He looks <HI>healthy, hearty,</HI> and
<HI>chearful,</HI> and, I believe, would not change
his pre&s;ent Life, for his pa&s;t, for the greate&s;t
&s;en&s;ual Gratifications; he is now yearly grow|ing
better, and is like to hold it out to a <HI>great</HI>

Oppre&s;&s;ion, Lowne&s;s, and Anxiety to a great
Degree, by which he had been long op|pre&s;&s;ed.
He had been always very tempe|rate,
of a &s;light tender Make, but of late
had grown very thin, dry, and was run|ning
almo&s;t into a <HI>Scorbutical</HI> and <HI>Nervous

been much reliev'd; but at la&s;t none of

<HEAD>CASE VI.</HEAD>
<P>A <HI>Gentleman's Lady of Oxford&s;hire,</HI> of as
much <HI>Virtue, Piety, Charity,</HI> and good
Sen&s;e, as any one I ever was acquainted
with, came here to <HI>Bath,</HI> for <HI>&s;chirrous Knots</HI>
and <HI>Tumors</HI> in her Brea&s;t, which both I and
other <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> believed to be a Threatning
or Beginning <HI>Cancer.</HI> I tried here with her
<HI>Cinnabar, Milliped, Lenitive Electuary, Dia|ca&s;&s;ia
cum Manna,</HI> and other cooling and &s;oft
<HI>Openers,</HI> with a regulated young <HI>Animal
Food Diet,</HI> and a very little <HI>Wine,</HI> under
the Cour&s;e of the <HI>Bath</HI> Waters, which &s;he
pur&s;ued here for many Weeks with great
Exactne&s;s and con&s;iderable Benefit. I ad|vi&s;ed
her to continue the &s;ame Medicines at
Home, with <HI>A&s;&s;es Milk</HI> and <HI>Bri&s;tol Waters,</HI>
which &s;he per&s;i&s;ted in all that <HI>Winter;</HI> but
<PB N="297" REF="331">
towards <HI>Spring</HI> her <HI>Pains</HI> and <HI>Shootings</HI> be|came
more inten&s;e and frequent, being
attended with a Cough, by which &s;he began
to be alarmed, as far as one of her admirable
<HI>Patience</HI> and <HI>Re&s;ignation</HI> could be. I then
told her plainly, that nothing but a <HI>total
Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable Diet</HI> could &s;ave her from
a <HI>Cancer,</HI> which &s;he mo&s;t implicitly &s;ubmit|ted
to, and has continued in ever &s;ince, and
is now become the mo&s;t <HI>lively, ea&s;y,</HI> and

<P>I. MANY more Ca&s;es I could men|tion,
of &s;uch as, in the like
<HI>Di&s;tempers</HI> with the&s;e here &s;pe|cified,
have actually obtained under my
Direction a <HI>la&s;ting and &s;olid Cure,</HI> by a Regi|men
<PB N="298" REF="332">
of <HI>Diet</HI> and &s;uch <HI>Medicines,</HI> as I have
hinted. But if the&s;e will not &s;atisfy my Rea|der,
<HI>Volumes</HI> of <HI>Ca&s;es</HI> would not; they will
be &s;ufficient for the <HI>Candid Mi&s;erable</HI> and <HI>Sin|cere;</HI>
the <HI>Captious Healthy,</HI> and the <HI>Diffident,</HI>
nothing I can &s;ay will &s;atisfy. It is certain
none will undertake &s;uch a <HI>Method,</HI> till they
have found all others vain and ineffectual;
nor can I blame any one for &s;o doing: If the
Gratification of their <HI>Palate</HI> and <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> be of
greater Plea&s;ure to them than their Sufferings
are of Pain, they are as yet unfit for any &s;uch
Regimen or <HI>Method;</HI> they mu&s;t be <HI>wor&s;e,</HI> be|fore
they can be <HI>better.</HI> I think it pretty cer|tain
from the Way of Living of the <HI>lower</HI> Rank
of all Nations, that &s;uch a <HI>Regimen</HI> will not
directly <HI>kill</HI> or <HI>&s;tarve</HI> any thing but <HI>Di&s;tem|pers:</HI>
Unle&s;s the <HI>Wound</HI> be actually <HI>mortal</HI> and

even then it will prolong their <HI>Days,</HI> and make
their <HI>Pa&s;&s;age</HI> le&s;s mi&s;erable and painful, than
any other Method; and I daily &s;ee many
wretched Per&s;ons <HI>complaining, grumbling,</HI> and
inwardly cur&s;ing the <HI>Creator</HI> of the <HI>Univer&s;e</HI>
for their Mi&s;eries and Sufferings, who I am
<HI>morally</HI> and <HI>medically</HI> certain, bring all their
Wretchedne&s;s on them&s;elves, by con&s;tantly
over-loading, bur&s;ting and cramming the <HI>poor
pa&s;&s;ive Machine:</HI> and who, by the Methods and
Medicines I have mentioned, might be made
<HI>ea&s;y, chearful,</HI> and <HI>happy,</HI> tho' not perhaps al|ways
at <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> (unle&s;s they have few <HI>Humours</HI>
<PB N="299" REF="333">
or <HI>Salts</HI> in their Juices) yet &s;urely in <HI>&s;ome Time.</HI>
A <HI>vegetable Patient</HI> of mine, very ju&s;tly ob|&s;erved
to me, that whereas before, he could
never tru&s;t his Appetite's Longings or Craving,
while on an <HI>animal high Diet,</HI> without &s;uffer|ing
to Extremity: Now he found, he might
&s;afely and &s;ecurely tru&s;t Nature and Appe|tite,
without Danger, Fear or Suffering.
Others I have known, who having entered
upon, and being in &s;ome Degree recovered by
this Method and the&s;e Medicines, yet have
continued Weak, Poor, and Valetudinary all
their Days, for Want of <HI>Re&s;olution</HI> and <HI>Per|&s;everance</HI>
in it, by being divided and frightened
by the unexperienced <HI>Gain&s;ayers.</HI> But in about
thirty Years <HI>Practice,</HI> in which I have in &s;ome
Degree or other, advi&s;ed this Method in pro|per
Ca&s;es, I have had but two <HI>Patients,</HI> in
who&s;e total Recovery, I have been mi&s;taken,
and theirs were both <HI>&s;crophulous Ca&s;es,</HI> where
the <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Tubercules</HI> were &s;o many, &s;o
<HI>hard</HI> and <HI>impervious,</HI> that even the <HI>ponderous</HI>
Remedies and <HI>Diet</HI> joined, could not di&s;cu&s;s
them, and they were <HI>both</HI> al&s;o too far gone
before they entered upon them; and I have
found deep <HI>&s;crophulous</HI> Vapours, the mo&s;t ob|&s;tinate
and perver&s;e of any of this <HI>Tribe</HI> of the&s;e
Di&s;tempers: and indeed nothing can po&s;&s;ibly
reach &s;uch, but the <HI>ponderous</HI> Medicines, joined
with a <HI>liquid, cool, &s;oft Milk and Seed Regi|men;</HI>
and if the&s;e <HI>two</HI> do not in due Time,
I can boldly affirm it, nothing ever will.</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="334">
II. ONE of the mo&s;t terrible Objections, &s;ome
weak Per&s;ons make again&s;t this <HI>Regimen</HI> and
<HI>Method,</HI> is, that upon accidental <HI>Trials,</HI> they
have always found <HI>Milk, Fruit,</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI>
&s;o inflate, blow them up, and rai&s;e &s;uch <HI>Tu|mults</HI>
and <HI>Tempe&s;ts</HI> in their Stomach and Bow|els,
that they have been terrified and affrighted
from going on. I own the <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Fact</HI> to
be &s;uch in &s;ome as is repre&s;ented: And that in
<HI>Stomachs</HI> and <HI>Entrails</HI> inured only to hot and
high Meats and Drinks, and con&s;equently in an
<HI>inflammatory</HI> State, and full of <HI>Choler</HI> and
<HI>Phlegm,</HI> this <HI>Sen&s;ation</HI> will &s;ometimes happen;
ju&s;t as a Bottle of <HI>Cyder</HI> or <HI>fretting Wine,</HI> when
the Cork is pulled out, will fly up, fume, and
rage: And if you throw in a little <HI>Ferment</HI> or
<HI>Acid,</HI> (&s;uch are <HI>Milk, Seeds, Fruit</HI> and <HI>Vege|tables</HI>
to them) the <HI>Efferve&s;cence</HI> and <HI>Tempe&s;t</HI>
will exa&s;perate to a <HI>Hurricane.</HI> But what is
Wind, Flatulence, Flegm, and Choler? But
&s;topp'd <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI> &s;uperfluous Nouri&s;hment,
inconcocted <HI>Chyle</HI> of high Food and &s;trong Li|quors,
fermenting and putrifying? And when
the&s;e are &s;hut up and cork'd, with &s;till more and
more &s;olid, &s;trong, hot, and <HI>&s;typtick</HI> Meats and
Drinks, is the Corruption and Putrefaction
thereby le&s;&s;ened? Will it not then at la&s;t
either bur&s;t the Ve&s;&s;el or throw out the Cork
or Stoples, and rai&s;e more la&s;ting and cruel
<HI>Tempe&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Tumults?</HI> Are <HI>Milk and Vegeta|bles,</HI>
Seeds and Fruits, harder of Dige&s;tion,
<PB N="301" REF="335">
more <HI>Corro&s;ive,</HI> or more capable of producing
<HI>Chyle, Blood,</HI> and Juices, le&s;s fit to <HI>circulate,</HI>
to <HI>per&s;pire,</HI> and be <HI>&s;ecreted?</HI> But what is to be
done? The <HI>Cure</HI> is obvious. Begin by De|grees,
Eat le&s;s <HI>Animal</HI> Food: the mo&s;t tender
and young, and drink le&s;s &s;trong fermented Li|quors
for a Month or two; then proceed to a
<HI>trimming</HI> Diet, of one Day <HI>Seed</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI>
and another, tender young <HI>Animal</HI> Food; in
the mean Time take frequent gentle <HI>Wa&s;h-Vo|mits,</HI>
and <HI>Rhubarb</HI> and <HI>Bark</HI> Stomach Purges;
drink <HI>Mineral</HI> and <HI>Chalybeat</HI> Waters, and <HI>Aque|ous
Bitters;</HI> take <HI>Te&s;taceous</HI> Powders and <HI>Al|kaline
Earths,</HI> and then by Degrees &s;lide into a
total <HI>Milk, Seed, and Vegetable Diet:</HI> Cooling
the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Entrails</HI> gradually, to fit
them for this &s;oft, mild, &s;weetening <HI>Regimen;</HI>
and in Time your Diet will give you all the
<HI>Gratification</HI> you ever had from <HI>&s;trong, high,
and rank</HI> Foods and <HI>&s;pirituous</HI> Liquors: And
you will enjoy to the Bargain at la&s;t,
<HI>Ea&s;e, free Spirits, perfect Health,</HI> and <HI>long
Life. Milk</HI> of all Kinds, and <HI>Seeds,</HI> are
fitte&s;t to begin with in &s;uch Ca&s;es, when
dried, finely ground and dre&s;s'd, and con|&s;equently
the lea&s;t <HI>flatulent.</HI> Le&s;&s;en the
Quantity even of the&s;e, under what your
Appetite would require, at lea&s;t for a Time.
<HI>Bear a little, and forbear, Virtue</HI> and <HI>good
Health</HI> are not to be obtain'd without &s;ome
Labour and Pains again&s;t contrary Habits.
It was a wild <HI>Bounce</HI> of a <HI>Pythagorean,</HI> who
<PB N="302" REF="336">
defy'd any one, to produce an In&s;tance of a
Per&s;on who had long lived on <HI>Milk and
Vegetables:</HI> who ever <HI>cut</HI> his own <HI>Throat,
hang'd</HI> or <HI>made away</HI> with him&s;elf; who had
ever &s;uffered at <HI>Tyburn,</HI> gone to <HI>Newgate,</HI>
or to <HI>Moorfields,</HI> (and he added profanely)
or would go to <HI>Hell</HI> hereafter.</P>
<P>III. ANOTHER <HI>doughty</HI> Objection again&s;t a
<HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI> I have heard has been made
by <HI>learned Gentlemen:</HI> And is, that <HI>Vegeta|bles</HI>
require great <HI>Labour,</HI> &s;trong <HI>Exerci&s;e,</HI>
and much <HI>Action,</HI> to dige&s;t and turn them
into proper <HI>Nutriment,</HI> as (&s;ay they) is evi|dent
from its being the common <HI>Diet</HI> of
<HI>Day-Labourers, Handy-Craft&s;men,</HI> and <HI>Farm|ers:</HI>
This Objection I &s;hould have been
a&s;hamed to mention, but that I have heard it
came from the Men of Learning; and they
might have as ju&s;tly &s;aid, that <HI>Free-&s;tone</HI>
is harder than <HI>Marble,</HI> and that the Juice of
<HI>Vegetables</HI> makes &s;tronger Glew than that of
<HI>Fi&s;h</HI> or <HI>Beef!</HI> Do not <HI>Children</HI> and young
Per&s;ons, <HI>that is,</HI> tender Per&s;ons, live on
<HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Seeds,</HI> even before they are capa|ble
of much Labour and Exerci&s;e? Do not
all the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> and <HI>Southern</HI> People, live in|tirely
almo&s;t on them? The <HI>A&s;iaticks,
Moors,</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> who&s;e <HI>Climates</HI> incapa|citate
them for much Labour, and who&s;e
<HI>Indolence</HI> is &s;o ju&s;tly a Reproach to them?
Are there lazier and le&s;s laborious Men than
<PB N="303" REF="337">
the <HI>Highlanders</HI> and <HI>Native Iri&s;h?</HI> The
Truth is, <HI>Hardne&s;s</HI> of <HI>Dige&s;tion</HI> does princi|pally
depend on the Minutene&s;s of the Com|ponent
<HI>Particles:</HI> as is evident in <HI>Marble</HI> and
<HI>precious Stones;</HI> and <HI>Animal</HI> Sub&s;tances be|ing
made of Particles that pa&s;s through innu|merable,
very little, or <HI>infinitely &s;mall excre|tory
Ducts,</HI> mu&s;t be of a much finer <HI>Texture,</HI>
and con&s;equently harder and tougher in their
Compo&s;ition, than any <HI>Vegetable</HI> Sub&s;tance
can be: And the <HI>Fle&s;h</HI> of <HI>Animals</HI> that
live on <HI>Animals</HI> are like double di&s;till'd
Spirits, and &s;o require much more La|bour
to break, grind and dige&s;t them:
And indeed, if <HI>Day-Labourers</HI> and <HI>Handy-Craft&s;men</HI>
were allowed the high, &s;trong
Food of Men of <HI>Condition:</HI> And the <HI>quick</HI>
and much <HI>thinking</HI> Per&s;ons were confined to
the <HI>Farmer</HI> and <HI>Ploughmens</HI> Food, it
would be much happier for both.</P>
<P>IV. THE <HI>la&s;t Objection</HI> I &s;hall take Notice
of again&s;t a <HI>Milk and Vegetable Diet,</HI> is, that
it breeds <HI>Phlegm,</HI> and &s;o is unfit for tender
Per&s;ons of cold Con&s;titutions, e&s;pecially
tho&s;e who&s;e predominant Failing is too much
<HI>Phlegm:</HI> But this Objection has as little
Foundation as any of the precedent; <HI>Phlegm</HI>
is nothing but &s;uperfluous <HI>Chyle</HI> and Nou|ri&s;hment,
or the taking down more Food,
than the <HI>Expences</HI> of Living, and the <HI>Wa&s;te</HI>
of the <HI>Solids</HI> and <HI>Fluids</HI> require; the People
<PB N="304" REF="338">
that live mo&s;t on &s;uch Foods, (the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI>
and <HI>Southern</HI> People, and tho&s;e of the <HI>Nor|thern</HI>
I have mentioned) breed le&s;s <HI>Phlegm</HI>
than any others. <HI>Superfluity</HI> will always
produce <HI>Redundancy,</HI> whether it be of <HI>Phlegm</HI>
or <HI>Choler;</HI> and that which will Dige&s;t the
mo&s;t readily, will breed the le&s;t <HI>Phlegm,</HI> (as
is evident from infinite <HI>Experiment</HI> and the
be&s;t <HI>Philo&s;ophy</HI>) &s;uch are <HI>Milk, Seeds,</HI> and
<HI>Vegetables.</HI> Generally &s;peaking, the <HI>Phlegm</HI>
in the <HI>Glands,</HI> in the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and on the
<HI>Stomach,</HI> is nothing but the <HI>Vi&s;co&s;ity</HI> of the
<HI>Serum</HI> of the Blood, and that which will
lea&s;t produce <HI>Vi&s;co&s;ity,</HI> will produce lea&s;t
<HI>Phlegm;</HI> it is true, by cooling and relaxing
the Solids, the <HI>Phlegm</HI> will be more readily
thrown up and di&s;charged; more, I &s;ay, by
&s;uch a <HI>Diet,</HI> than by a hot, high, <HI>cau&s;tick,</HI>
and re&s;tringent one; but that Di&s;charge is a
Benefit to the Con&s;titution, and will help it
the &s;ooner and fa&s;ter to <HI>di&s;pumate</HI> and <HI>purify,</HI>
and &s;o to get into perfect good Health;
whereas by &s;huting the&s;e up, the <HI>Ca&s;e</HI> or
Cask mu&s;t fly and bur&s;t &s;o much the &s;ooner.</P>
<P>V. THE only material and &s;olid Objections
again&s;t a <HI>Milk, Seed,</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI> Diet
are, <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That it is <HI>particular</HI> and <HI>un&s;ocial,</HI>
in a Country where the common Diet is of
another Nature: But I am &s;ure <HI>Sickne&s;s,
Lowne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion</HI> is much more &s;o;
and I &s;hould never advi&s;e any one to &s;uch a
<PB N="305" REF="339">
<HI>Diet,</HI> who can do tolerably under a <HI>common</HI>
one: Tho' the&s;e Difficulties happen only at
fir&s;t, while the <HI>Cure</HI> is about: for when good
Health comes, the&s;e <HI>Oddne&s;&s;es</HI> and <HI>Speciali|ties</HI>
will vani&s;h, and then all the contrary to
the&s;e will be the Ca&s;e. <HI>Secondly,</HI> That it is
<HI>weakening,</HI> and gives a Man le&s;s Strength and
Force than common Diet. It is true, that
may happen at fir&s;t al&s;o, while the <HI>Cure</HI> is im|perfect;
but then the greater <HI>Activity</HI> and
<HI>Gayety</HI> which will en&s;ue on Health, under a
<HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable Diet,</HI> will liberally &s;upply
that Defect, if real; and I &s;hould never advi&s;e
any one to &s;uch a <HI>Diet,</HI> who&s;e Manner of
Living and <HI>Occupation</HI> requires great <HI>Mecha|nical</HI>
Force, Labour, and Strength; for they
&s;eldom or never can want &s;o poor and low a
<HI>Diet</HI> for this Di&s;temper, becau&s;e their <HI>Labour</HI>
and <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> drawing off and <HI>antidoting</HI> the
Faults and Inconveniencies of a full, &s;trong,
and free Manner of Living, will pre&s;ervethem;
&s;o it will never be required or be nece&s;&s;ary or
fit for the <HI>governed,</HI> but the <HI>governing;</HI> never
for tho&s;e who&s;e Excellence lies in their <HI>Limbs,</HI>
but tho&s;e who&s;e Superiority lies in their <HI>Heads</HI>
and <HI>thinking Faculties;</HI> never for the <HI>Active,</HI>
but for the <HI>Sedentary.</HI> But <HI>thirdly,</HI> The mo&s;t
material Objection again&s;t &s;uch a Diet, is, that
it <HI>cools, relaxes, &s;oftens,</HI> and <HI>unbends</HI> the Solids
at fir&s;t, fa&s;ter than it <HI>corrects, thins,</HI> and
<HI>&s;weetens</HI> the Juices, and &s;o brings on greater
Degrees of Lowne&s;s, than it is de&s;igned to
<PB N="306" REF="340">
Cure, and &s;o &s;inks in&s;tead of rai&s;ing. But this
Objection is not univer&s;ally true, for there
are many I have treated, who without any
<HI>Rub, Inconvenience,</HI> or con&s;equent <HI>Lowne&s;s,</HI>
have gone into this <HI>Regimen,</HI> and have been
free from any <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion, Sinking,</HI> or any
Degree of Weakne&s;s ever after; and they
were not only tho&s;e who have been gene|rally
Temperate and <HI>Clean,</HI> free from Hu|mours
and Sharpne&s;&s;es; but who on the
<HI>Decline</HI> of Life, or from a naturally weak
Con&s;titution or Frame, have been oppre&s;s'd
and &s;unk, from their Weakne&s;s and their
Incapacity to <HI>dige&s;t</HI> common <HI>Animal Food,</HI>
and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors. Tho&s;e who have
been very <HI>Voluptuous,</HI> or very <HI>Gro&s;s,</HI> when
this cooling <HI>Diet</HI> has loo&s;ened their gro&s;s
<HI>Humours, acrid Bile</HI> and <HI>&s;harp Serum,</HI> mu&s;t
&s;uffer in throwing the&s;e off; but I have &s;ug|ge&s;ted
Means con&s;tantly to relieve the&s;e
Symptoms. <HI>Bark, Rhubarb, Bitters, Steel,</HI>
and <HI>Chalybeat Mineral Waters,</HI> will always
keep up the Ten&s;ion of the Solids in a De|gree
&s;ufficient for &s;uch a Diet; and I
very much que&s;tion if any <HI>Diet,</HI> either
<HI>hot</HI> or <HI>cool,</HI> has any great Influence on the
<HI>Solids,</HI> after the Fluids have been intirely
&s;weetened and <HI>balmified.</HI> For then I have
always found the <HI>Solids</HI> return to much
the &s;ame State of <HI>Strength</HI> and <HI>Spring,</HI>
they were in before the Di&s;temper; and
all the Functions return to the &s;ame <HI>Tenor:

<P><HI>COlonel Town&s;hend,</HI> a Gentleman of excel|lent

afflicted with a <HI>Nephritick</HI> Complaint, at|tended
with con&s;tant <HI>Vomitings,</HI> which had
made his Life painful and mi&s;erable. Dure|ing
the whole Time of his <HI>Illne&s;s,</HI> he had
ob&s;erved the &s;tricte&s;t <HI>Regimen,</HI> living on the
&s;ofte&s;t Vegetables and lighte&s;t <HI>Animal Foods,</HI>
drinking <HI>A&s;&s;es Milk</HI> daily, even in the Camp:
and for common Drink <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Water, which,
the Summer before his <HI>Death,</HI> he had drunk
on the <HI>Spot.</HI> But his Illne&s;s increa&s;ing, and
his Strength decaying, he came from <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI>
to <HI>Bath</HI> in a Litter, in Autumn, and lay at
the <HI>Bell-Inn.</HI> Dr. <HI>Baynard</HI> (who is &s;ince

him twice a Day for about the Space of a

<PB N="308" REF="342">
we de&s;paired of his <HI>Recovery.</HI> While
he was in this Condition, he &s;ent for us
early one Morning: we waited on him, with
Mr. <HI>Skrine</HI> his <HI>Apothecary</HI> (&s;ince dead al&s;o);
we found his <HI>Sen&s;es</HI> clear, and his <HI>Mind</HI>

<HI>odd Sen&s;ation,</HI> he had for &s;ome Time ob|&s;erved
and felt in him&s;elf: which was,
that compo&s;ing him&s;elf, he cou'd <HI>die</HI> or
<HI>expire</HI> when he pleas'd, and yet by
an <HI>Effort,</HI> or &s;ome how, he could come
to Life again: which it &s;eems he had
&s;ometimes tried before he had &s;ent for
<HI>us.</HI> We heard this with <HI>Surprize,</HI> but
as it was not to be accounted for from now
<HI>common Principles,</HI> we could hardly be|lieve
the <HI>Fact</HI> as he related it, much le&s;s
give any Account of it: unle&s;s he &s;hould
plea&s;e to make the <HI>Experiment</HI> before us,
which we were unwilling he &s;hould do,
la&s;t, in his weak Condition, he might
carry it too far. He continued to talk very
di&s;tinctly and &s;en&s;ibly above a Quarter
of an Hour about this (to Him) &s;ur|pri&s;ing
<HI>Sen&s;ation,</HI> and in&s;i&s;ted &s;o much
on our &s;eeing the <HI>Trial</HI> made, that we
were at la&s;t forced to comply. We all
<HI>three</HI> felt his Pul&s;e fir&s;t: it was di&s;tinct, tho'
&s;mall and <HI>threedy:</HI> and his <HI>Heart</HI> had
<PB N="309" REF="343">
its u&s;ual Beating. He compos'd him&s;elf
on his Back, and lay in a &s;till Po&s;ture
&s;ome time: while <HI>I</HI> held his right Hand,
Dr. <HI>Baynard</HI> laid his Hand on his Heart,
and Mr. <HI>Skrine</HI> held a clean Looking-gla&s;s
to his Mouth. I found his <HI>Pul&s;e</HI>
&s;ink gradually, till at la&s;t I could not
feel any, by the mo&s;t exact and nice
Touch. Dr. <HI>Baynard</HI> could not feel the
lea&s;t Motion in his <HI>Heart,</HI> nor Mr. <HI>Skrine</HI>
the lea&s;t Soil of Breath on the bright
<HI>Mirror</HI> he held to his Mouth; then each
of us by <HI>Turns</HI> examin'd his <HI>Arm, Heart</HI>
and <HI>Breath,</HI> but could not by the nice&s;t
<HI>Scrutiny</HI> di&s;cover the lea&s;t <HI>Symptom</HI> of
<HI>Life</HI> in him. We rea&s;on'd a long Time
about this odd <HI>Appearance</HI> as well as
we could, and all of us judging it in|explicable
and unaccountable, and finding
he &s;till continued in that Condition, we
began to conclude that he had indeed
carried the <HI>Experiment</HI> too far, and at
la&s;t were &s;atisfied he was actually dead,
and were ju&s;t ready to leave him. This
continued about half an Hour, by Nine
a'Clock in the Morning in <HI>Autumn.</HI> As we
were going away, we ob&s;erv'd &s;ome Motion
about the Body, and upon Examination,
found his <HI>Pul&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Motion</HI> of his
<HI>Heart</HI> gradually returning: he began to
<HI>breath</HI> gently and &s;peak &s;oftly: we were
all a&s;toni&s;h'd to the la&s;t Degree at this
<PB N="310" REF="344">
unexpected Change, and after &s;ome fur|ther
Conver&s;ation with him, and among
our&s;elves, went away fully &s;atisfy'd as
to all the Particulars of this Fact, but
confounded and puzled, and not able to
form any rational <HI>Scheme</HI> that might ac|count
for it. He afterwards called for
his <HI>Attorney,</HI> added a <HI>Codicil</HI> to his <HI>Will,</HI>
&s;ettled Legacies on his Servants, re|ceived
the <HI>Sacrament,</HI> and calmly and
compo&s;edly expir'd about five or &s;ix a'Clock
that Evening. Next Day he was opened,
(as he had ordered) his Body was the
founde&s;t and be&s;t made I had ever &s;een;
his <HI>Lungs</HI> were fair, large and found, his
<HI>Heart</HI> big and &s;trong, and his <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI>
&s;weet and clean; his <HI>Stomach</HI> was of a
due Proportion, the <HI>Coats</HI> &s;ound and thick,
and the villous <HI>Membrane</HI> quite entire.
But when we came to examine the <HI>Kid|neys,</HI>
tho' the <HI>left</HI> was perfectly &s;ound
and of a ju&s;t <HI>Size,</HI> the <HI>right</HI> was about
four Times as big, di&s;tended like a blown
<HI>Bladder,</HI> and yielding as if full of Pap;
he having often pa&s;s'd a <HI>Wheyi&s;h</HI> Liquor
after his Urine, dureing his Illne&s;s. Upon
opening this <HI>Kidney,</HI> we found it quite
full of a white <HI>Chalky</HI> Matter, like <HI>Plai&s;ter
of Paris,</HI> and all the fle&s;hy Sub&s;tance di&s;|&s;olved
and worn away, by what I called
a <HI>Nephritick Cancer.</HI> This had been the
Source of all his Mi&s;ery; and the <HI>&s;ympto|matick</HI>
<PB N="311" REF="345">
Vomitings from the Irritation on
the con&s;entient <HI>Nerves,</HI> had quite &s;tarved
and worn him down. I have narrated the
<HI>Facts,</HI> as I &s;aw and ob&s;erved them deli|berately
and di&s;tinctly, and &s;hall leave to
the <HI>Philo&s;ophick Reader</HI> to make what In|ferences
he thinks fit; the Truth of the
material Circum&s;tances I will warrant.</P>

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOURS of <HI>May</HI> la&s;t was mo&s;t agree|able:
I am much oblig'd to, and at the
&s;ame Time charm'd with, that <HI>ma&s;terly</HI>
Rea&s;oning in &s;uch <HI>ma&s;&s;y</HI> Expre&s;&s;ions, as
brings the mo&s;t &s;ubtile <HI>Speculations</HI> in a
Manner to the Sen&s;es, in plain Concep|tions,
va&s;tly like the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of <HI>Nature,</HI>
which is never perplex'd, however much
<PB N="312" REF="346">
&s;o our Accounts of it may be. What
you are plea&s;ed to communicate, of a
<HI>Treati&s;e</HI> you de&s;ign for the Pre&s;s, gives
me great Plea&s;ure. A <HI>Cla&s;s</HI> of Di&s;ea&s;es
&s;o univer&s;ally frequent, and &s;o peculiarly
the <HI>Cloud</HI> and <HI>Bane</HI> of the mo&s;t worthy
and valuable <HI>Lives; deep</HI> &s;et in the <HI>Oeco|nomy,</HI>
and &s;o little gained upon by
<HI>Medicine: &s;uperficially</HI> treated by its <HI>Pro|fe&s;&s;ors,</HI>
and <HI>carele&s;ly</HI> or <HI>weakly</HI> trifled with
by the Patients; demands and well de|&s;erves
a <HI>Ma&s;ter's Hand.</HI> I rejoice to find
the Task undertaken, by one equally
qualify'd to do Ju&s;tice to the Subject,
and Good to Mankind. For my own
Part I &s;hall never reflect upon the mi&s;e|rable
<HI>Di&s;tre&s;s</HI> I have &s;uffer'd, but with
grateful Remembrance of that kind Hu|manity,
wherewith you communicated your
frank and friendly Advice. The clear
di&s;tinct Knowledge, from &s;mall imperfect
<HI>Hints,</HI> you had at fir&s;t of my Di&s;temper,
was equally &s;urprizing, with the po&s;itive
A&s;&s;urance of Succe&s;s, with which you pre&s;&s;ed
to per&s;uade and encourage my following
your <HI>Method of Cure;</HI> nothing but ma|ture
Experience and well-taken Ob&s;erva|tions,
upon certain Principles of <HI>Science,</HI>
cou'd have warranted, or &s;upported a Predic|tion
more like <HI>prophetick Security,</HI> than
<HI>phy&s;ical Progno&s;tick,</HI> which hitherto has
an&s;wer'd; as I have faithfully the Con|dition.
<PB N="313" REF="347">
And now Dr. Dr. <HI>Infandum!&mdash;Jubes
renovare Dclorem.</HI> But as &s;o good a Friend's
Commands are &s;acred, if it may in the
lea&s;t be &s;erviceable to your Purpo&s;e, I
&s;hall, be&s;ide what you know already,
give a &s;hort <HI>Ab&s;tract,</HI> as I can now re|collect,
of the Origin and Progre&s;s of
my Di&s;ea&s;e, wherein, without the lea&s;t
Rea&s;oning, Conjecture or Term of <HI>Art,</HI>
I &s;hall confine it to a &s;imple Narration
of mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential Matters of <HI>Fact,</HI> without
troubling you with every Circum&s;tance
and <HI>Symptom,</HI> which however proper to
the true <HI>Hi&s;tory of a Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> would be
too tedious and perhaps &s;uperfluous here.
And tho', at be&s;t, I'm always at a va&s;t
Lo&s;s for Language and Expre&s;&s;ion, I mu&s;t
beg you'll forgive my carele&s;s Freedom
in this: While I write with Ea&s;e and
Openne&s;s to a Friend: if you can but take the
Meaning, I hope whatever U&s;e you plea&s;e to
make of it, you'll be &s;o kind as to treat
me and it as your own.</P>
<P>(1) A Con&s;titution rather <HI>tractable</HI> than
&s;trong, nor &s;ubject to con&s;iderable Di&s;or|ders,
except &s;uch tran&s;ient <HI>Symptoms</HI> of a
<HI>Colluvies Sero&s;a,</HI> upon Cold or Errors in
Life, as commonly denominate a <HI>&s;curbu|tick
Habit,</HI> never afflicted &s;ince Childhood
with any formed Di&s;ea&s;e, till at <HI>Leyden,</HI>
I got an <HI>autumnal Quartan</HI> in 1719, <HI>then
<PB N="314" REF="348">
Epidemical in Holland;</HI> which gave ea&s;y
Way to the <HI>Cortex,</HI> and the whole &s;uc|ceeding
Winter had no Relap&s;e; but that
&s;ame Winter I fir&s;t &s;uffer'd by Gripes and
Purging, which always &s;eiz'd me early in
the Morning without the lea&s;t further
Trouble through the Day. The follow|ing
Spring Sea&s;on, a Return of the <HI>Ague</HI>
in a tertian <HI>Type,</HI> carried off that <HI>Symp|tom,</HI>
which never return'd more for &s;e|veral
Years, to interrupt good Health,
in pur&s;uing my Bu&s;ine&s;s with con&s;idera|ble
Fatigue, carele&s;s altogether of either
<HI>Diet,</HI> or Expo&s;ures to all Airs in all Sea&s;ons
without much Inconvenience.</P>
<P>(2) ABOUT <HI>Spring</HI> Time 1727, I began
to be vi&s;ited now and then with an odd
unea&s;y Sen&s;ation in the right Side, between
the fal&s;e Ribs and <HI>Spine</HI> of the <HI>Ilium,</HI> or, as
I judged, at the Seat of the <HI>Coecum,</HI> which
&s;eldom came up to acute Pain: but of
various Feelings, &s;ometimes of Coldne&s;s,
at other Times of Heat, and often it felt
like <HI>vermicular</HI> Motions, or <HI>&s;pa&s;modick</HI>
Workings in that Part; and the&s;e <HI>Symp|toms</HI>
would &s;ometimes be communicated
to the external <HI>Teguments,</HI> at other Times
&s;pread inward to the <HI>Bowels</HI> in different
Commotions. This Trouble, without much
further affecting the Body, came and went
at fir&s;t a long Time, but, always irri|tated
<PB N="315" REF="349">
by Cold, became at la&s;t more con|&s;tant
through the whole Summer, when
I <HI>dragg'd</HI> about with a great deal of Trouble;
now become more univer&s;al, as frequent <HI>chilly
cold Horrors,</HI> &s;ick <HI>Periods,</HI> with a quick
&s;mall Pul&s;e and dry Mouth, in&s;uperable
Coldne&s;s in the <HI>Extremities,</HI> even in the
hotte&s;t Days, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE Beginning of <HI>Autumn</HI> 1727, after
being much expos'd to cold rainy Wea|ther,
my former Complaints formed more
directly into <HI>Gripes,</HI> and &s;ick <HI>Throws</HI> in
the Guts; which often aro&s;e from, or at
lea&s;t mo&s;t affected that fir&s;t Seat of Trou|ble
in the right Side, and &s;ettled into
<HI>periodical</HI> Returns, which were about the
Evening Sun-&s;et: and the &s;ame Hours in
the Morning: which <HI>Periods,</HI> or I may
call them <HI>Paroxy&s;ms,</HI> continued always
till by repeated Evacuations of crude <HI>Foe|ces</HI>
and glutinous <HI>Lentor</HI> the <HI>Inte&s;tines</HI>
were throughly evacuated. But retaining
an Appetite &s;harp enough, and being to|lerable
ea&s;y in the Intervals, without mind|ing
its Progre&s;s or Con&s;equence, I per&s;i|&s;ted
in my ordinary Cour&s;e of Living and
Bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' with &s;evere Incommodement,
and daily Aggravations from Cold: till
the Middle of <HI>October,</HI> when the Sea&s;on
turning Bitter Cold and Wet, all the
<HI>Symptoms</HI> increa&s;ed, attended with a <HI>La|tent
<PB N="316" REF="350">
Fever,</HI> I was di&s;abled at once and
confin'd.</P>
<P>(3) THUS, tho' better and wor&s;e, I con|tinued
after the &s;ame Manner all the <HI>Win|ter</HI>
in great Di&s;tre&s;s; oppre&s;s'd with in|numerable
<HI>Symptoms,</HI> which partly aro&s;e
from the <HI>Genius</HI> of the Di&s;ea&s;e, and partly
from its Effects on the <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> and
&s;o more common to an exhau&s;ted Con|&s;titution
and debilitated <HI>Nerves;</HI> which need
not be enumerated here. When the Di&s;|ea&s;e
was not diverted from its Cour&s;e by
<HI>Medicine, Management</HI> or an exce&s;&s;ive <HI>Fever,</HI>
that &s;ometimes made its Violence conti|nual
without Regularity; the <HI>Dy&s;enterick
Symptoms</HI> &s;eem'd generally inclined to pe|riodical
<HI>Exacerbations,</HI> which commonly be|gan
in the Morning early about four or five,
and kept near the &s;ame Evening Hours.
The <HI>Gripes</HI> and <HI>Purging</HI> were u&s;hered
in with a <HI>mortified</HI> Coldne&s;s, e&s;pecially
in the Extremities; deep felt in the <HI>ten|denous</HI>
Parts: the <HI>Gripes</HI> thro' all the <HI>Guts,</HI>
but chiefly the <HI>Colon,</HI> and that on the
right Side, which &s;oon after affected the
<HI>Rectum</HI> with wringing Violence, and rigid
<HI>Pre&s;&s;ure</HI> on Dejection; after one Motion,
no more quiet, but by repeated Irritation
all the <HI>mucous</HI> and crude Contents were
di&s;charged, after which the &s;ucceeding Stools
were &s;urprizingly different, at different
<PB N="317" REF="351">
Times: liquid purely, or <HI>Cra&s;s,</HI> in all the malig|nant
Variety of Colours and Con&s;i&s;tence that
has ever been ob&s;erved in that Di&s;charge; and
while that Matter was moving in its De&s;cent
thro' the <HI>Guts,</HI> the horrid Sen&s;ations, <HI>Rigors,</HI>
Heart-&s;ick Throws, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which attended its
Progre&s;s, always <HI>progno&s;ticated</HI> the virulent
Appearance.</P>
<P>AFTER this Cour&s;e of &s;everal Hours was
fini&s;hed, there was &s;ome Re&s;pite till the <HI>Inte|&s;tines</HI>
were again replete, or the new Time of
Acce&s;s approached, when the &s;ame <HI>Scene</HI> was
repeated. In the mean Time the <HI>Urine</HI> was
variable, of a deep <HI>&s;aturate</HI> Colour, when the
<HI>Fever</HI> was &s;en&s;ibly high, with a <HI>lateritious,</HI>
dusky or dark Sediment &s;ometimes, e&s;peci|ally
when the Purging was retarded or aba|ted;
good Quantities of crude, limpid, or
greeni&s;h tinctur'd <HI>Urine,</HI> of a bitter acrid Pun|gency;
often attended with <HI>nervous</HI> Affec|tions,
for ordinary about 10 or 12 a'Clock of the
Day, the <HI>Urine</HI> would come to &s;ome Seperation:
towards the Evening more crude and limpid,
and the &s;ame again at the Morning <HI>Period.</HI></P>
<P>FOR Ordinary, when the Fever was
moderate and no immediate <HI>Nau&s;ea</HI> affect|ing
the Stomach, the Appetite was to|lerable;
&s;ometimes &s;harp and an unnatural
Craving, with an ungrateful acid Ta&s;te in
the Mouth; but eating was but laying
<PB N="318" REF="352">
in a new Load, rather to be pre&s;&s;ed
down in new Commotions than dige&s;ted.
Little Thir&s;t, except &s;ometimes, when a
<HI>Dryne&s;s</HI> of the Mouth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> or <HI>feveri&s;h</HI>
internal Heat, made it unquenchable. Com|monly
a rigid Dryne&s;s of the Skin, tho'
oft-times <HI>Symptomatick</HI> Flu&s;hes of Sweat,
rarely univer&s;al and natural: which when
it happen'd of a <HI>critical</HI> kindly Sort with
gentle urinous Di&s;charge, &s;eldom fail'd of
doing Service. By labouring thus thro'
the whole Winter, you may believe I
was pretty much exhau&s;ted and emacia|ted,
with con&s;iderable Swelling, of the
Legs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P><HI>MEDICINES,</HI> I us'd &s;everal to little
Effect, <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> or the gentle&s;t <HI>Stimulus</HI> enra|ged
all the <HI>Symptoms;</HI> all ea&s;y gentle
A&s;tringents of every kind had no Effect,
and &s;trong ones, as <HI>Decoct. Dia&s;cord.</HI> with
<HI>Terra Japonica,</HI> proved violent <HI>Catharticks;
Injections</HI> of any kind, when the Di&s;ea&s;e
rag'd, promoted it; <HI>Opiats</HI> only, tho' not
always, check'd the Purging; but only
by &s;i&s;ting the Action of irritate <HI>Fibres,</HI>
the Load was accumulated for a redoubled
Di&s;charge: and in the mean Time mo&s;t
always produced a <HI>Nau&s;ea,</HI> Vomiting, with
many other <HI>nervous Symptoms,</HI> till their
retentive Power was gone, and never failed
<PB N="319" REF="353">
effectually to debar Sleep, tho' by quieting
Pain, it gave ea&s;y <HI>watching Re&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>(4) ABOUT <HI>March</HI> 1728, with the A&s;&s;i|&s;tance
of <HI>Opiats,</HI> the Di&s;ea&s;e began to abate,
and at la&s;t the Purging went off, but left the
<HI>Sy&s;tem</HI> va&s;tly debilitated; and &s;ubject to
many Di&s;orders, proper to &s;uch a State;
however I pa&s;s'd the <HI>Summer</HI> and next
<HI>Winter</HI> without the <HI>Dy&s;entery;</HI> but in con|tinual
Hazard of a <HI>Relap&s;e,</HI> and little Con|firmation
of Health or Strength. All that
Time I made choice of the mo&s;t <HI>drying</HI>
Food, and red Wines in &s;mall Quanti|ties;
with a &s;imple Intention to ab&s;tract
from the <HI>Materies Morbi,</HI> and corroborate
the <HI>primae Viae,</HI> ab&s;taining from whatever
might be &s;aid to moi&s;ten or relax.</P>
<P>(5) TOWARDS the End of <HI>Summer</HI> 1729,
the old <HI>Symptoms</HI> (2) began to recur. I
neglected them, &s;till expo&s;ing to the <HI>au|tumnal</HI>
Colds, till all came to the &s;ame
Heights as before; (3) went through the
&s;ame Cour&s;e of Di&s;tre&s;s that Winter with
little e&s;&s;ential Variation, &s;ave what might
ari&s;e from the greater Violence of the
Di&s;ea&s;e, and le&s;s equal Strength in the
Subject. Except a few Weeks of Re&s;pite
from the <HI>Dy&s;entery</HI> that <HI>Spring,</HI> without
which it is likely Nature had yielded. I
had no more Intermi&s;&s;ion all the <HI>Summer</HI>
<PB N="320" REF="354">
1730, the Di&s;ea&s;e rag'd with more Heat
and Thir&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the warm Sea&s;on allow'd me to drag
a feeble and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Body abroad, and
that as far as <HI>Tunbridge;</HI> I made Trial of
the Waters there, you know, without any
Succe&s;s, returning to <HI>London</HI> in as great Di|&s;tre&s;s
as ever; I wanted much to be deter|min'd,
doubtful if I &s;hould be carried towards
<HI>Bath</HI> or Home: I then fir&s;t made free with
a <HI>Character</HI> I was a little acquainted with by
the <HI>Pre&s;s,</HI> and asked your Opinion: by a
&s;peedy and kind Return, you di&s;&s;uaded me
from <HI>Bath,</HI> upon good Rea&s;ons, confirmed
by Experience, and with a <HI>friendly Warmth,</HI>
advis'd a <HI>Method</HI> of <HI>Living,</HI> as the only Cure
remaining, pre&s;&s;ed by mo&s;t encouraging A&s;|&s;urance
of Succe&s;s, if I was not beyond the
Power of <HI>natural Agents.</HI> I obey'd, came
Home through a Journey of the greate&s;t Di|&s;tre&s;s
ever one travelled, and immediately be|gan
<HI>your Method,</HI> of a <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>vegetable Diet,</HI>
but the Di&s;ea&s;e rag'd with &s;uch Violence,
and natural Strength was &s;o far gone, that
I was not able to ob&s;erve any <HI>Rules</HI> with
Exactne&s;s. All the <HI>Symptoms</HI> (3) formerly
mentioned were aggravated with &s;everal
Changes, which I cannot particularly re|late,
only, in general, more &s;en&s;ible Heat,
Thir&s;t, and evident <HI>Fever,</HI> then had ever
been before.</P>
<P><PB N="321" REF="355">
AT this Time, <HI>Jan.</HI> 1731. when exhau&s;|ted
more than ever, the Purging, by a little
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Opiats,</HI> after a Day's <HI>Nau&s;ea</HI>
and <HI>Vomiting,</HI> was abated, which pre&s;erved
the remaining Life. I then began to be
exact in <HI>Diet,</HI> re&s;tricting it only to <HI>Milk</HI> and
<HI>Grains of Rice, Millet,</HI> &amp;c. and abdicated all
<HI>animal</HI> Food; in about &s;ix Weeks or two
Months, the <HI>Dy&s;entery</HI> gave Truce, in which
Time I was often fretted with <HI>&s;trangurious Sym|ptoms.</HI>
I &s;ometimes took Notice of one <HI>Phae|nomenon</HI>
in the <HI>Urine,</HI> which I never remem|ber
to have &s;een, or heard, or ob&s;erv'd before,
which was the <HI>Pellicle,</HI> which it commonly
carry'd on the Top, was powdered with ex|ceeding
&s;mall <HI>&s;hineing Particles,</HI> like <HI>Gold-du&s;t;</HI>
the Sides of the Gla&s;s be&s;et with the

<P>(6.) THE Beginning of next <HI>March</HI> 1731.
the Sea&s;on being a &s;harp Fro&s;t, after &s;ome
Days of chilly mortify'd Cold, I was &s;eiz'd
with a heavy <HI>Stupor</HI> and <HI>feveri&s;h</HI> Heat, with
a Return of the <HI>Dy&s;entery;</HI> by this Time,
feeble, and little able to &s;tand the Shock: the
<PB N="322" REF="356">
<HI>Stomach</HI> felt loaded, which came to a Vomit|ing
of a heavy <HI>Pituit:</HI> the Sen&s;e of a &s;tuf|fing
Load &s;till remaining, I took a Vomit,
which di&s;charg'd a va&s;t Quantity of <HI>crude
Flegm,</HI> clear and gla&s;&s;y, ju&s;t as the unbroken
White of Eggs; &s;till the Weight at <HI>Stomach</HI>
continued, the <HI>Fever</HI> increa&s;ed with biteing
Heat and great Thir&s;t, a <HI>Pul&s;e</HI> feeble, <HI>unequal,</HI>
and <HI>quick;</HI> at the &s;ame time a languid In|flammation
&s;eized my Throat, and Parts
about it: A little after appeared an Eruption
of <HI>Apthae</HI> in the Mouth, e&s;pecially on the
Tongue, which was all over thick &s;et, with
very &s;mall <HI>pellucid Pearl-coloured Pu&s;tles:</HI>
the&s;e were attended with a great <HI>Salivation</HI> of
crude, in&s;ipid cra&s;s Stuff, &s;uch as I had vo|mitted;
the <HI>Apthae</HI> remained con&s;tant, the
Sinking and Ri&s;ing as the <HI>Fever</HI> varied, mo&s;t
Part highe&s;t at Night. After about a Week,
the <HI>Apthae</HI> changed their Colour to pale-red,
then darker, &s;ometimes livid, and at la&s;t a
black Depre&s;&s;ion on the Top of every one of
them. By this Time, natural Strength was
ju&s;t a going, mo&s;tly &s;upported by <HI>A&s;&s;es
Milk,</HI> which too I was re&s;trained from by
rea&s;on of the great Effu&s;ion of Urine, which
it provok'd. Scarce able to move out of Bed,
after two or three Weeks thus on the Brin$
of Di&s;&s;olution, it plea&s;ed God to &s;et the
Bounds! The <HI>Symptoms</HI> all gradually, &s;lowly
and in&s;en&s;ibly declined, and the <HI>Dy&s;entery</HI>
went off at the &s;ame Time.</P>
<P><PB N="323" REF="357">
VII. I re&s;olutely, as &s;oon as capable of a

<HI>bland vegetable Food,</HI> and <HI>elementary Drink;</HI>
and, without any other Medicine, &s;ave fre|quent
chewing of <HI>Rhubarb,</HI> and &s;ometimes
a little <HI>Cortex.</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed la&s;t Winter and this
Summer without a <HI>Relap&s;e</HI> of the <HI>Dy&s;entery;</HI>
and, tho' by a very &s;low Advance, I find
now more Re&s;titution of the Body, and Re|gularity
in the <HI>Oeconomy,</HI> on this <HI>primitive
Aliment,</HI> than ever I knew from the Begin|ning

not ta&s;ted any thing that had <HI>animal Life.</HI>
There is Plenty in the <HI>vegetable</HI> Kingdom,

may be convinced of the great
Influence that <HI>Aliment</HI> mu&s;t have on the
<HI>Cra&s;is</HI> and Con&s;titution of our Bodies, which
it daily &s;upplies, and of which, at la&s;t, it
becomes <HI>con&s;tituent Materials.</HI> And yet for
want of due Attention to this <HI>noble Branch</HI> of
<HI>Medicine,</HI> or from a vicious Indulgence, and
Weakne&s;s of Re&s;olution, how often is our

<P>I HAVE too much tried your Patience with
an unpoli&s;hed but faithful Relation of <HI>Facts,</HI>

<P>WHEN it is not mi&s;pending your Time,

<HEAD>The CASE of the Author.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; I. I Was born of healthy Parents, in
the <HI>Prime</HI> of their Days, but di&s;|pos'd
to <HI>Corpulence,</HI> by the whole
Race of one Side of my <HI>Family.</HI> I pa&s;&s;ed
my <HI>Youth</HI> in clo&s;e Study, and almo&s;t con|&s;tant
Application to the <HI>ab&s;tracted Scien|ces,</HI>
(wherein my chief Plea&s;ure con&s;i&s;ted)
and con&s;equently in great <HI>Temperance</HI> and a
<HI>&s;edentary Life;</HI> yet not &s;o much but that I
&s;ometimes kept <HI>Holiday,</HI> diverted my&s;elf
with the Works of <HI>Imagination,</HI> and rou&s;ed
<HI>Nature</HI> by agreeable Company and <HI>good
Cheer;</HI> but, upon the &s;lighte&s;t <HI>Exce&s;&s;es,</HI> I
always found &s;lippery Bowels, or a Spitting
to be the <HI>Cri&s;e;</HI> whence afterwards, on Re|flection,
I concluded, that my <HI>Glands</HI> were
naturally <HI>lax,</HI> and my <HI>Solids feeble;</HI> in which
Opinion I was confirmed, by an early <HI>Shakeing</HI>
of my <HI>Hands,</HI> and a Di&s;po&s;ition to be ea&s;ily
ruffled on a <HI>Surprize.</HI> Upon my coming to <HI>Lon|don,</HI>
I all of a &s;udden changed my whole Man|ner
of Living; I found the <HI>Bottle-Companions,</HI>
the <HI>younger Gentry,</HI> and <HI>Free-Livers,</HI> to be
<PB N="326" REF="360">
the mo&s;t ea&s;y of <HI>Acce&s;s,</HI> and mo&s;t quickly
&s;u&s;ceptible of <HI>Friend&s;hip and Acquaintance,</HI>
nothing being nece&s;&s;ary for that Purpo&s;e, but
to be able to <HI>Eat</HI> lu&s;tily, and &s;wallow down
much <HI>Liquor;</HI> and being naturally of a large
<HI>Size,</HI> a cheerful Temper, and tolerable lively
<HI>Imagination,</HI> and having, in my Country Re|tirement,
laid in Store of <HI>Ideas</HI> and <HI>Facts,</HI> by
the&s;e Qualifications I &s;oon became care&s;&s;ed
by them, and grew daily in <HI>Bulk,</HI> and in
Friend&s;hip with the&s;e gay Gentlemen and
their Acquaintances: I was tempted to con|tinue
<HI>this Cour&s;e,</HI> no doubt, from a <HI>Likeing,</HI>
as well as to force a <HI>Trade,</HI> which Method I
had ob&s;erv'd to &s;ucceed with &s;ome others;
and thus con&s;tantly Dineing and Supping in
<HI>Taverns,</HI> and in the Hou&s;es of my Acquain|tances
of <HI>Ta&s;te</HI> and <HI>Delicacy,</HI> my Health was
in a few Years brought into great Di&s;tre&s;s,
by &s;o &s;udden and violent a Change. I grew
exce&s;&s;ively <HI>$at, &s;hort-breath'd, Lethargic</HI> and
<HI>Li&s;tle&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; II. THE fir&s;t &s;en&s;ible <HI>Shock</HI> I had, was
an <HI>autumnal intermittent Fever;</HI> this I con|quer'd
in a few Weeks with the <HI>Bark,</HI>
which, at that time, I found exceeding
<HI>fre&s;h, thin, Cinnamon-coloured,</HI> and <HI>curled:</HI>
This &s;ort (as I know from long Experience)
greatly contributing to the Speed and Cer|tainty
of the <HI>Cure</HI> of &s;uch Di&s;tempers, being
more ea&s;ily dige&s;ted, and entering more rea|dily
<PB N="327" REF="361">
into the Ma&s;s of the Blood, while the
Stomach is &s;poilt by a <HI>Di&s;ea&s;e,</HI> and the Juices
under a <HI>praeternatural Ferment.</HI> For one
Year I went on tolerably well, tho' as it
were <HI>jumbled</HI> and <HI>turbid,</HI> and neither &s;o <HI>clear</HI>
in my Faculties, nor &s;o <HI>gay</HI> in my Temper:
But next Autumn I was &s;uddenly &s;eized with
a <HI>vertiginous Paroxy&s;m,</HI> &s;o extreamly fright|ful
and terrible, as to approach near to a <HI>Fit</HI>
of an <HI>Apoplexy,</HI> and I was forced in it to lay
hold on the Po&s;ts of my Bed, for fear of
tumbling out, as I apprehended. After im|mediate
<HI>Bleeding</HI> and <HI>Vomiting</HI> (whereby its
Violence was abated) I thought it might be
owing to an <HI>anomalous</HI> Fit of my relap&s;ing <HI>In|mittent,</HI>
and thereupon took about four Oun|ces
of this fine <HI>Bark</HI> in 48 Hours, but with|out
any &s;en&s;ible Benefit or Injury. I found
after this, &s;ome &s;mall Returns of my <HI>Vertigo</HI>
(in Bed e&s;pecially) on lying on a particular
Side, or pre&s;&s;ing upon a particular Part of my
Head; but by Degrees it turned to a con|&s;tant
violent <HI>Head-ach, Giddine&s;s, Lowne&s;s,
Anxiety</HI> and <HI>Terror,</HI> &s;o that I went about
like a <HI>Malefactor</HI> condemn'd, or one who ex|pected
every Moment to be cru&s;hed by a
<HI>ponderous</HI> In&s;trument of Death, hanging
over his Head. At this time I left off
<HI>Suppers</HI> of all kinds, and have never re&s;um'd
them &s;ince; then, even at <HI>Dinner,</HI> eating
but a &s;mall Quantity of <HI>animal Food,</HI> and
drinking very little fermented Liquor, well
<PB N="328" REF="362">
knowing, that <HI>Di&s;ea&s;es</HI> mu&s;t always be
cur'd by their <HI>Contraries.</HI> On this Occa&s;ion,
all my <HI>Bouncing, prote&s;ting, undertaking</HI> Com|panions
for&s;ook me, and dropt off like <HI>au|tumnal
Leaves:</HI> They could not bear, it &s;eems,
to &s;ee their Companion in &s;uch Mi&s;ery and
Di&s;tre&s;s, but retired to comfort them&s;elves
with a <HI>cheer-upping</HI> Cup, leaving me to pa&s;s
the melancholy Moments with my own <HI>Ap|prehen&s;ions</HI>
and <HI>Remor&s;e.</HI> Even tho&s;e who
had &s;har'd the be&s;t Part of my Profu&s;ions,
who, in their Nece&s;&s;ities, had been a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
my fal&s;e Genero&s;ity, and in their Di&s;orders
relieved by my Care, did now entirely relin|qui&s;h
and abandon me; &s;o that I was forc'd
to retire into the Country quite alone, being
reduc'd to the State of <HI>Cardinal Wol&s;ey,</HI> when
he &s;aid, that if he had &s;erv'd his <HI>Maker</HI> as
faithfully and warmly as he had his <HI>Prince,</HI>
he would not have for&s;aken him in that Ex|tremity;
and &s;o will every one find, when
<HI>Union</HI> and <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> is not founded on <HI>&s;olid
Virtue,</HI> and in Conformity to the <HI>Divine
Order,</HI> but in <HI>&s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ures</HI> and mere
<HI>Jollity.</HI> This &s;illy Circum&s;tance I mention,
becau&s;e I thought then, it had &s;ome Share in
my &s;ucceeding <HI>Melancholy.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; III. I RETIR'D, I &s;ay, to the Country,
into a fine Air, and liv'd very low: I had a
<HI>Seton</HI> made in my Neck, which I carried
about for many Months; I took frequent
<PB N="329" REF="363">
<HI>Vomits,</HI> and gentle <HI>Purges,</HI> try'd <HI>Volatiles,
Foetids, Bitters, Chalybeats,</HI> and <HI>Mineral
Waters,</HI> and had the Advice of all my <HI>Phy|&s;ical
Friends,</HI> but with little or no &s;en&s;ible
Benefit; my <HI>Head-ach, Giddine&s;s, Watchings,
Lowne&s;s,</HI> and <HI>Melancholy</HI> rather increa&s;ing on
me. I had by chance heard of the great Be|nefit,
which one of my particular Acquain|tances
had reap'd from &s;ome active <HI>mercurial</HI>
Medicines (tho' pre&s;crib'd by a very in&s;uffi|cient
<HI>Practitioner</HI>) in a violent &s;tupifying
<HI>Head-ach,</HI> which I had Rea&s;on to believe came
by the &s;ame Intemperance; the&s;e I re&s;olv'd
to try. I <HI>fir&s;t</HI> took 20 Grains of what is call'd
the <HI>Princes Powder,</HI> which gave me twelve
<HI>Vomits,</HI> and near twice the Number of
Stools; and I had certainly peri&s;hed under
the Operation, but for an <HI>Over-do&s;e</HI> of <HI>Lau|danum</HI>
after it. In two or three Days more,
I took 12 Grains of <HI>Turbith-mineral,</HI> which
had not quite &s;o violent an Effect; after
that I took 10 Grains of <HI>Calomel,</HI> twice a
Day, for about ten Days together; this put
me into a <HI>Petit Flux de Bouche:</HI> After which
in three Weeks Time I got abroad light&s;omer
indeed, and le&s;s confus'd, tho' &s;till very bad,
and &s;carce any thing better, but not wor&s;e;
but two Months after that, I found an extream
Sickne&s;s in my <HI>Stomach,</HI> which obliged me to
take frequent <HI>Vomits,</HI> the&s;e now pumping up
<HI>Oceans</HI> of <HI>Choler,</HI> which they had never done
in any Degree before: Whence I concluded,
<PB N="330" REF="364">
that the <HI>ponderous Remedies</HI> I had taken, had
opened my ob&s;tructed <HI>Liver, Gall-bladder,</HI>
and <HI>Porus Biliarius,</HI> and broken the Cohe|&s;ion
of the vi&s;cid Juices.</P>
<P>&sect; IV. WHILE I was thus (as I have &s;aid)
for&s;aken by my <HI>Holiday</HI> Friends, and my
Body was, as it were, melting away like a
<HI>Snow-ball</HI> in Summer, being dejected, <HI>me|lancholy,</HI>
and much confin'd at home, by my
Cour&s;e of <HI>mineral</HI> Medicines, and Country
Retirement, I had a long Sea&s;on for undi|&s;turbed
<HI>Meditation</HI> and <HI>Reflection</HI> (my Fa|culties
being then as clear and quick as ever)
which I was the more readily led into, that
I concluded my&s;elf infallibly entering into an
<HI>Unknown State of Things.</HI> Having had a <HI>liberal</HI>
and <HI>regular Education,</HI> with the In&s;truction and
Example of pious Parents (who, at fir&s;t, had
de&s;igned me for the <HI>Church</HI>) I had pre&s;erv'd
a firm Per&s;wa&s;ion of the great and fundamen|tal
Principles of all <HI>Virtue</HI> and <HI>Morality:</HI>
viz. the <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> of a <HI>&s;upreme and infinitely
perfect Being,</HI> the <HI>Freedom</HI> of the <HI>Will,</HI> the
<HI>Immortality</HI> of the Spirits of all intelligent
Beings, and the Certainty of <HI>future Rewards</HI>
or <HI>Puni&s;hments.</HI> The&s;e Doctrines I had ex|amined
carefully, and had been confirmed in,
from <HI>ab&s;tracted</HI> Rea&s;onings, as well as from
the be&s;t <HI>natural Philo&s;ophy,</HI> and &s;ome clearer
Knowledge of the <HI>material Sy&s;tem</HI> of the
World in general, and the <HI>Wi&s;dom, Fitne&s;s</HI>
<PB N="331" REF="365">
and beautiful Contrivance of particular
Things <HI>animated</HI> and <HI>inanimated;</HI> &s;o that the
Truth and Nece&s;&s;ity of the&s;e <HI>Principles</HI> was
&s;o riveted in me (which may be &s;een by the
fir&s;t Edition of my <HI>Philo&s;ophical Principles,</HI>
publi&s;hed &s;ome Years before that happened)
as never after to be &s;haken in all my <HI>Wander|ings</HI>
and <HI>Follies:</HI> And I had then the Con&s;o|lation
to reflect, that, in my loo&s;e&s;t Days, I
had never <HI>pimp'd</HI> to the <HI>Vices</HI> or <HI>Infidelity</HI> of
any, but was always a determined Adver|&s;ary
to both. But I found, that <HI>the&s;e</HI> alone
were not &s;ufficient to <HI>quiet</HI> my Mind at that
Juncture, e&s;pecially when I began to reflect
and con&s;ider &s;eriou&s;ly, whether I might not
(through <HI>Carele&s;&s;ne&s;s</HI> and <HI>Self-&s;ufficiency, Vo|luptuou&s;ne&s;s</HI>
and Love of <HI>Sen&s;uality,</HI> which
might have impaired my <HI>Spiritual</HI> Nature)
have neglected to examine with &s;ufficient
Care: If there might not be more required of
tho&s;e, who had had proper <HI>Opportunities</HI> and
<HI>Lei&s;ure; if</HI> there might not, I &s;ay, be higher
more noble, and more enlightening <HI>Prin|ciples</HI>
revealed to Mankind <HI>&s;omewhere;</HI> and <HI>if</HI>
there were not more encouraging and enliven|ing
<HI>Motives</HI> propo&s;ed, to form a more exten|&s;ive
and <HI>Heroic</HI> Virtue upon, than tho&s;e ari|&s;ing
from <HI>natural</HI> Religion only (for then I
had gone little farther than to have taken
<HI>Chri&s;tianity</HI> and <HI>Revelation</HI> on <HI>Tru&s;t</HI>) and <HI>la&s;tly,
if</HI> there were not likewi&s;e &s;ome clearer Ac|counts
di&s;coverable of that <HI>State</HI> I was then
<PB N="332" REF="366">
(I thought) apparently going into, than
could be obtained from the mere Light of
<HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Philo&s;ophy.</HI> Such were my Re|flections
in this my <HI>melancholy</HI> Retirement,
and this led me to call to Mind, <HI>which,</HI> of
all my numerous and various Acquaintances,
I could wi&s;h to re&s;emble <HI>mo&s;t,</HI> now in the&s;e
my (to me &s;eemingly) approaching <HI>la&s;t</HI> Mo|ments;
and who among all tho&s;e of my par|ticular
Acquaintances, was <HI>He,</HI> who being of
&s;ound <HI>natural,</HI> and duly <HI>cultivated</HI> Parts, had
mo&s;t &s;trictly and con&s;tantly liv'd up to their
Convictions, under the commonly received
Principles, and plain Con&s;equences of <HI>Chri|&s;tianity.</HI>
In a Word, who it was I could re|member
to have had received, and lived up to
the plain Truths and Precepts contain'd in
the <HI>Go&s;pels,</HI> or more particularly in our <HI>Savi|our's
Sermon</HI> on the <HI>Mount.</HI> At that Time
among many whom my Memory &s;ugge&s;ted to
me, I fix'd on one, a worthy and learned
<HI>Clergyman</HI> of the <HI>Church of England,</HI> &s;uffici|ently
known and di&s;tingui&s;hed in the <HI>Philo|&s;ophical</HI>
and <HI>Theological</HI> World (whom I dare
not name, becau&s;e he is &s;till living, tho' now
extreamly old); and as in &s;tudying <HI>Mathe|maticks,</HI>
and in running over (as I was able)
Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton's Philo&s;ophical</HI> Works, I
had always pickt out, and mark'd down the
<HI>Authors</HI> and Writings mo&s;tly u&s;ed and
recommended by tho&s;e others, and by him,
becau&s;e I thought they could be&s;t judge of
<PB N="333" REF="367">
&s;uch; &s;o in this Ca&s;e the more quickly to
&s;ettle my <HI>Mind,</HI> and quiet my <HI>Con&s;cience,</HI> I
re&s;olved to purcha&s;e, &s;tudy, and examine
carefully &s;uch <HI>Spiritual</HI> and <HI>Dogmatic Authors,</HI>
as I knew this <HI>venerable Man</HI> did mo&s;t ap|prove
and delight in. In this Manner I col|lected
a <HI>Set of religious Books</HI> and <HI>Writers,</HI> of
mo&s;t of the <HI>fir&s;t Ages</HI> &s;ince <HI>Chri&s;tianity,</HI> recom|mended
by him, with a few others of the
mo&s;t <HI>Spiritual</HI> of the <HI>Moderns,</HI> which have
been my <HI>Study, Delight</HI> and <HI>Entertainment</HI>
in my Retirements ever &s;ince; and on the&s;e I
have formed my <HI>Ideas, Principles</HI> and <HI>Senti|ments:</HI>

<HI>late,</HI> and <HI>&s;ince</HI> the <HI>Earlie&s;t Ages,</HI> have been

atrocious a <HI>nervous</HI> Ca&s;e) ari&s;es, or, at
lea&s;t, is exa&s;perated from &s;uch Reflections,
being once &s;ettled and quieted, <HI>That</HI> after
becomes an excellent <HI>Cordial,</HI> and a con&s;tant
Source of <HI>Peace, Tranquillity</HI> and <HI>Cheerful|ne&s;s,</HI>
and &s;o greatly contributes to forward
the Cure of &s;uch <HI>nervous</HI> Di&s;ea&s;es: For I ne|ver
found any &s;en&s;ible <HI>Tranquillity</HI> or A|mendment,
<PB N="334" REF="368">
till I came to this firm and &s;ettled
<HI>Re&s;olution</HI> in the Main, <HI>viz. To neglect nothing
to &s;ecure my eternal Peace, more than if I had
been certified I &s;hould die within the Day: nor
to mind any Thing that my &s;ecular Obligations
and Duties demanded of me le&s;s, than if I had
been en&s;ured to live fifty Years more.</HI> This,
tho' with infinite Weakne&s;s and Imperfection,
has been much my &s;ettled Intention in the
Main &s;ince.</P>
<P>&sect; V. THE Spring following I was advi&s;ed
and pre&s;&s;ed by all my Friends, and the <HI>Phy|&s;icians</HI>
I con&s;ulted, to try the <HI>Bath Waters.</HI>
I went there accordingly, for the fir&s;t Time,
as a <HI>Patient;</HI> and, for many Weeks, was
much relieved both in my <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Spi|rits</HI>
by them: And tho' in the Opinion of
the World, I liv'd very temperately, yet by
increa&s;ing the Quantity of my <HI>Animal</HI> Food,
and <HI>&s;trong</HI> Liquors (my Appetite being now
&s;tronger and more craving, and my Spirits
brisker, from the drinking of the Waters (in
the Space of four or five Months, I was
heated &s;o, as to apprehend a <HI>Hectic.</HI> I then
changed the <HI>Bath</HI> for <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Waters, re|trenched
my <HI>Diet,</HI> and increa&s;ed my daily
Rideing and Exerci&s;e, and continued &s;ome|times
gentle <HI>Vomits:</HI> by which I pa&s;t that
Year better than the former, tho' far from
well; but, on the Return of the next Spring,
&s;ome <HI>Symptoms</HI> were exa&s;perated, in&s;omuch
that their Severity, the Continuance of my
<PB N="335" REF="369">
Mi&s;eries, and the con&s;tant Complaints, com|mon
to <HI>Hypi&s;h</HI> People, made Life a Burden
to my&s;elf, and a Pain to my Friends. I ac|cidentally
met with a Clergyman, who told
me of a wonderful Cure, which Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> of
<HI>Croydon</HI> had wrought on him&s;elf in an <HI>Epi|leptick
Ca&s;e,</HI> by a total <HI>Milk Diet.</HI> This <HI>Hint</HI>
accidentally dropt, wrought &s;o on me, that
I began to recollect a great many Things,
that before had e&s;caped me without much
Reflection. I had read in Dr. <HI>Sydenham,</HI>
that in violent and ob&s;tinate <HI>Hy&s;terick Fits</HI>
and <HI>Colicks,</HI> he had, with great Succe&s;s, pre|&s;cribed
a <HI>total Milk Diet,</HI> as the la&s;t and
&s;ure&s;t Remedy. Dr. <HI>Pitcairn,</HI> my Ma&s;ter and
Friend, in his <HI>Dictates</HI> had recommended it as
the only <HI>infallible Cure</HI> in an inveterate <HI>Scur|vy,
Cacochimy</HI> and totally vitiated Juices: And
I my&s;elf knew it to be the only Remedy in the
<HI>Gout,</HI> a confirmed <HI>Hectic</HI> and <HI>Con&s;umption,</HI>
and had &s;een Miracles wrought by it in &s;uch
Ca&s;es; be&s;ides, I knew <HI>nervous</HI> Di&s;tempers
of all Kinds, differed only in Degrees. All
the&s;e Con&s;iderations determined me, next
Day, in the Middle of Winter, to ride to
<HI>Croydon</HI> to advi&s;e with Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI> per&s;onally.
I found him at home, at his full Quart of
Cow's Milk (which was all his Dinner.) He
told me, he had had the Advice of all the
mo&s;t eminent <HI>Phy&s;icians</HI> of his Time about
<HI>London,</HI> and had taken all their Medicines,
and all he had ever read or heard of, for his
<PB N="336" REF="370">
<HI>Epilep&s;y,</HI> but with &s;o little Succe&s;s, that he
u&s;ed frequently to be &s;eized with it on the
Road, while he was rideing in the Country
about the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Profe&s;&s;ion, &s;o that
dropping from his Hor&s;e, he remained &s;en&s;e|le&s;s,
till by the next Waggoner or Pa&s;&s;enger
he was carried to the neare&s;t Hou&s;e; and that
both his <HI>Life</HI> and <HI>Faculties</HI> had been in the
utmo&s;t Danger by it; but that, on reading
<HI>Sydenham,</HI> he had fir&s;t dropt all fermented
Liquors, whereby his <HI>Fits</HI> became le&s;s vio|lent
and frequent, and then, by Degrees, he
had given over all <HI>animal Food,</HI> living in|tirely
on <HI>Cow-Milk,</HI> with which, at fir&s;t, he
u&s;ed only to take a few Drops of <HI>Sal volatile</HI>
or <HI>Harts-horn,</HI> or a Spoonful of <HI>compound
Poeony</HI> Water, to prevent its curdling; that,
in a Year or two his <HI>Fits</HI> had entirely left
him: and that now, for <HI>&s;eventeen Years,</HI> he
had enjoyed as good Health as human Na|ture
was capable of, except that once in a
damp Air and foggy Weather, rideing thro'
<HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> he had been &s;eized with an <HI>Ague,</HI>
which he had got over, by chewing the <HI>Bark.</HI>
He told me, he could then play &s;ix Hours at
<HI>Cricket</HI> on <HI>Ban&s;tead-Down,</HI> without Fatigue
or Lowne&s;s, and was more <HI>active</HI> and <HI>clear</HI> in
his <HI>Faculties and Sen&s;es</HI> than ever he had been
in his Life before. He informed me al&s;o of
a great many Per&s;ons he had cured of invete|rate
Di&s;tempers by this <HI>Diet,</HI> and particularly
that he had removed the <HI>Barrenne&s;s</HI> of &s;ome
<PB N="337" REF="371">
great Families by it, who before had wanted
<HI>Heirs.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. VI. HAVING thus fully &s;atisfy'd all
my Doubts and Difficulties, I return'd to
<HI>London,</HI> fully determin'd to enter upon this
Cour&s;e, for which I was &s;ufficiently before
prepared, by the low <HI>Animal Diet,</HI> and
&s;mall Quantity of fermented Liquors, I had
of a long Time been accu&s;tomed to. I
drank <HI>Cow-Milk</HI> from the <HI>Park</HI> every Morn|ing,
and engag'd a Milk Woman, at a
higher Price than ordinary, to bring me
every Day as much pure and unmix'd, as
might be &s;ufficient for <HI>Dinner</HI> and <HI>Breakfa&s;t;</HI>
(for, as I mentioned before, I had given over
all Kinds of <HI>Suppers,</HI> and never after re|&s;um'd
them, having always found my&s;elf
wor&s;e on the &s;lighte&s;t Attempts that way at
Night, tho' even in Milk and Vegetables.)
I u&s;ed <HI>Seeds, Bread, mealy Roots,</HI> and <HI>Fruit</HI>
with my Milk indifferently, taking them all
to be pretty near of the &s;ame Nature and
Cla&s;s of Foods: <HI>Milk</HI> being <HI>Vegetables</HI> im|mediately
cook'd by <HI>Animal Heat</HI> and <HI>Organs,</HI>
and directly (without going the Circulation)
drawn from their <HI>Chyle,</HI> or from an <HI>Emul&s;ion</HI> of
Vegetables in the Stomach. I thought &s;carce any
grown Per&s;on was &s;o delicately fram'd by Na|ture,
or that I was not reduced to &s;uch extreme
Weakne&s;s, that <HI>infinite&s;imal</HI> Errors, could do
great Hurt; and therefore I continued all the&s;e,
<PB N="338" REF="372">
for a little Variety, le&s;t I &s;hould be cloy'd by
only one Kind of Food; and ever &s;ince have
u&s;ed and pre&s;cribed <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> indif|ferently,
in extreme low and dangerous Ca&s;es
only, when &s;ufficiently prepared by <HI>Culinary
Heat and Organs,</HI> and am per&s;uaded they differ
little in their Nature. In five or &s;ix Months
I was con&s;iderably recovered; only upon the
<HI>Glands</HI> being loaded, and the peccant Matter
of the old Habit being thrown upon the <HI>chyli|$erous</HI>
Duct, and the con&s;tantly en&s;uing Op|pre&s;&s;ion
and Re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s thereupon; I was forced
to clean&s;e them often by a gentle <HI>Vomit,</HI> or an
<HI>Aloetick Pill,</HI> which as con&s;tantly re&s;tored me
to my u&s;ual clear and free Spirits, and to a
good Appetite for my then Food.</P>
<P>&sect;. VII. BY this Time I had been ex|tremely
reduced in my Fle&s;h, and was be|come
Lank, Fleet and Nimble; but &s;till,
upon any Error even in this low Diet, I
found more or le&s;s Oppre&s;&s;ion and Lowne&s;s.
Next Spring tho' I began to feel a con&s;tant
Pain, fix'd in the <HI>Pit</HI> of my <HI>Stomach,</HI> which I
mi&s;took for a <HI>Pulmonary</HI> Ca&s;e, and therefore
became &s;till more temperate and ab&s;temious
even in this my Milk and Seed Diet. Dure|ing
all this Time, I generally rode a
Hor&s;eback ten, or fifteen Miles a Day,
both Summer and Winter; in Summer on
the <HI>Downs</HI> at <HI>Bath,</HI> and in Winter on the
<HI>Oxford Road</HI> from <HI>London.</HI> I began more fre|quently
<PB N="339" REF="373">
then to take an <HI>Aloetick Pill,</HI> once
in ten or fourteen Days, (for <HI>Rhubarb</HI> never
agreed with me) which always gave me
great pre&s;ent Relief in my <HI>Stomach,</HI> and
con&s;equently in my <HI>Spirits.</HI> All this Time
I followed the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI>
with great Diligence and Attention, in Sum|mer
at <HI>Bath,</HI> and in Winter at <HI>London,</HI> ap|plying
my&s;elf more particularly to <HI>chroni|cal,</HI>
and e&s;pecially to low and nervous <HI>Ca&s;es,</HI>
they &s;eeming more immediately to concern
my &s;elf, and offering more frequently at
<HI>Bath,</HI> where all of that Kind, in both
<HI>I&s;lands,</HI> arrive fir&s;t or la&s;t, who can afford it.</P>
<P>&sect;. VIII. THE Pain in the <HI>Pit</HI> of my <HI>Sto|mach,</HI>
being now con&s;tant, violent, and
&s;eeming to increa&s;e, I began to think of
Dr. <HI>Taylor</HI>'s Chewing the <HI>Bark</HI> to cure his
Ague; and knowing it to be &s;o &s;overeign a
Remedy in <HI>Stomach and Nervous</HI> Ca&s;es, I
got &s;ome of the fine&s;t, and chewed about
half a <HI>Dram</HI> of it twice or three times a
Day, on an empty <HI>Stomach;</HI> and in ten Days
or three Weeks at mo&s;t, I found &s;o wonderful
a Change on my whole Man, as to <HI>Spirits,
Chearfulne&s;s, Strength</HI> and <HI>Appetite,</HI> by it, that
I thought it <HI>Enchantment,</HI> and could &s;carce
believe I was my&s;elf; and had I been much
<HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;tically</HI> given, would have accounted
it <HI>Miraculous,</HI> being naturally one of the&s;e
<HI>Quick-Thinkers,</HI> who have a great Sen&s;ibi|lity
<PB N="340" REF="374">
either of Plea&s;ure or Pain. My Juices
being thin, &s;weet, and fluid by the <HI>Diet,</HI> it
&s;eems there was nothing wanting to the per|fecting
Health, but the winding up and
bracing the Solids, for which the <HI>Bark</HI> was
<HI>&s;pecifick.</HI> From that Time forward I en|creas'd
in <HI>Spirits, Strength, Appetite</HI> and
<HI>Gaiety,</HI> till I began to find a Craving and
in&s;ufferable Longing for more Solid and
Tooth&s;ome Food, and for higher and
&s;tronger Liquors; but being well appri&s;ed
of the Danger of too &s;udden and quick a
<HI>Tran&s;ition,</HI> from a low to a high and fuller
<HI>Diet;</HI> I proceeded at fir&s;t with great Cau|tion
and Warine&s;s, eating only the Wing
of a &s;mall Chick, and drinking but one
Gla&s;s of white Wine (for I found all red,
and e&s;pecially <HI>French,</HI> by a grating on my
lax <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Guts,</HI> keep me awake
three or four Hours in the Night) all that
Summer and the next Winter (which I pa&s;s'd
at <HI>London</HI>) I enjoyed perfect good Health
and Spirits, tho' I had u&s;ed little or no Ex|erci&s;e;
but notwith&s;tanding all my Caution,
I had certainly gone too fa&s;t and too far
into this new <HI>animal Diet;</HI> for the Spring
following I was &s;eized with a <HI>depuratory
Fever,</HI> which notwith&s;tanding all the Skill
and Care of my Brethren, the <HI>Phy&s;icians,</HI>
la&s;ted above 20 Days, and the Medicine
(after the univer&s;al Evacuations) that had
the greate&s;t Share in my Recovery, was, I
<PB N="341" REF="375">
think, large Draughts of warm <HI>Barley</HI> Water or
&s;mall <HI>Sack-Whey, acidulated</HI> with <HI>Gas Sulph.</HI>
which was advis'd by Dr. <HI>Baynard,</HI> towards the
latter End of my <HI>Fever;</HI> this, at la&s;t, threw me
into a profu&s;e <HI>Sweat,</HI> which la&s;ted above three
or four Days, and reduc'd me &s;o extremely
low, that for &s;ome Time I liv'd chiefly on
<HI>French</HI> Claret, with Water and toa&s;ted Bread,
this being the only Food I could reli&s;h; and
tho' I never exceeded half a <HI>Pint,</HI> or at
mo&s;t a <HI>Pint</HI> of Wine a day, mixed with Wa|ter,
yet having u&s;ed my&s;elf to &s;o little for a
great while before, this &s;mall Quantity kept
me perpetually <HI>Hectical</HI> and Re&s;tle&s;s for
many Weeks, even after the <HI>Cri&s;e:</HI> &s;o that
I began to think I had done wrong before,
in u&s;eing my&s;elf to &s;o little Wine; and
therefore to &s;ecure again&s;t &s;uch an Accident
for the future, I began (after my perfect
Recovery) to inure my&s;elf by Degrees to
more Wine, gradually dropping or le&s;&s;ening
the Quantity of my <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> and
by &s;low Degrees and in moderate Quantities,
living only on the lighte&s;t and tendere&s;t
animal Food for &s;ome Time, and at la&s;t
gradually went into common Life, with great
<HI>Freedom,</HI> but exact common <HI>Temperance.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. IX. But the long and violent <HI>depuratory
Fever,</HI> which I did not get over entirely in
le&s;s than &s;ix Months, had &s;o drain'd, drench'd
and wa&s;ted me, that upon my total Recovery
<PB N="342" REF="376">
my Appetite being in&s;atiable, I &s;uck'd up
and retain'd the <HI>Juices</HI> and <HI>Chyle</HI> of my Food
like a <HI>Sponge,</HI> and thereby &s;uddenly grew
<HI>plump, fat</HI> and <HI>hale</HI> to a Wonder; but indeed
too fa&s;t. However, for near twenty Years, I
continued <HI>$ober, moderate</HI> and <HI>plain</HI> in my
Diet, and in my greate&s;t Health drank not
above a Quart, or three Pints at mo&s;t, of
<HI>Wine</HI> any Day, (which I then ab&s;urdly thought
nece&s;&s;ary in my Bulk and <HI>Stowage,</HI> tho' cer|tainly
by far an over <HI>Do&s;e</HI>) and that at Din|ner
only, one half with my Meat, with
Water, the other after, but none more that
Day, never ta&s;ting any Supper, and at Break|fa&s;t
nothing but Green Tea, without any
<HI>Eatable;</HI> but by the&s;e Means every Dinner
nece&s;&s;arily became a <HI>Surfeit</HI> and a <HI>Debauch,</HI>
and in ten or twelve Years, I &s;well'd to &s;uch
an enormous Size, that upon my la&s;t Weigh|ing
I exceeded 32 <HI>Stone.</HI> My Breath became
&s;o &s;hort, that upon &s;tepping into my Chariot
quickly, and with &s;ome Effort, I was ready
to faint away, for want of Breath, and my Face
turn'd Black. At <HI>Aynhoe</HI> (waiting on the late
Honourable Mrs. <HI>Cartwright</HI>) and going up
only one Pair of Stairs, with high Steps,
ha&s;tily, by pu&s;hing my Breath a little too
violently, to make room for tho&s;e that were
following, I was immediately &s;eiz'd with a
<HI>Convul&s;ive A&s;thma,</HI> returning by repeated
and &s;trong In&s;pirations, <HI>Fits</HI> and &s;mall In|tervals,
which la&s;ted above a Quarter of an
<PB N="343" REF="377">
Hour, &s;o that I thought to have died on the
Spot; but by <HI>Evacuations</HI> and <HI>low Living,</HI>
I got rid of this Di&s;order al&s;o, in &s;ome De|gree,
tho' after that, I was not able to walk
up above one Pair of Stairs at a Time,
without extreme Pain and Blowing, being
forced to ride from Door to Door in a Cha|riot
even here at <HI>Bath;</HI> and if I had but an
Hundred Paces to walk, was oblig'd to have
a Servant following me with a Stool to re&s;t on.</P>
<P>&sect;. X. ABOUT this Time (twelve Years
after my fir&s;t Recovery) my Legs broke
out all over in <HI>&s;corbutick Ulcers,</HI> the <HI>Ichor</HI>
of which corroded the very Skin, where it
lay any Time, and the fore Parts of both
Legs were one continued Sore. I had the
Advice and Care of many of the mo&s;t emi|nent
<HI>Surgeons</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> none of whom
could heal them up even in three Years.
Tir'd out at la&s;t, I took <HI>Aethiops Mineral</HI>
for four Months, in the mid&s;t of Winter:
half an Ounce at lea&s;t twice a Day, and a
Purge with twelve Grains of <HI>Calomel</HI> once a
Week, ob&s;erving a much lower Diet than
before; I found that the <HI>Mercury</HI> had not
only colour'd the <HI>Money</HI> in my Pocket, and
the <HI>Buttons</HI> in my Shirt; but to all my Ob|&s;ervation,
the very Sub&s;tance of the <HI>Aethiops</HI>
was tran&s;pir'd upon the <HI>Plai&s;ter,</HI> every
Day, when my Legs were dre&s;s'd, <HI>viz.</HI> to|wards
the End of the Cure; at lea&s;t, the Ap|pearances
&s;eem'd to me, on the Plai&s;ters, like
<PB N="344" REF="378">
a Steam or Smoke from <HI>Sulphur</HI> and <HI>Mercury,</HI>
and was quite different from what it had been
before I began that Cour&s;e: This I was per|fectly
a&s;&s;ured of, tho' I did not then think of
making &s;uch a <HI>critical</HI> Ob&s;ervation, as that
<HI>this</HI> In&s;tance might &s;erve as a Proof, that the
<HI>Aethiops</HI> pa&s;&s;ed through the Habit; tho' I am
certain &s;ince, from repeated <HI>Ob&s;ervations,</HI> that
every Preparation of <HI>Mercury,</HI> and even the
<HI>Crude</HI> it&s;elf, in Time, and in &s;ome lax Habits,
will <HI>Salivate</HI> in &s;ome Degree or another: and
that <HI>Mercury,</HI> in its <HI>minute&s;t Particles</HI> and in|&s;en&s;ible
<HI>Steams,</HI> does penetrate the &s;olid Parts of
all <HI>living Animals,</HI> as <HI>inflammable Spirits</HI> mo&s;t
certainly do. After this Cour&s;e, my Legs heal|ed
perfectly, with common Dre&s;&s;ings, and have
continued &s;ound ever &s;ince; my Health was
likewi&s;e very good for four or five Years after,
But continuing the &s;ame full, tho' (commonly
accounted) <HI>temperate Diet,</HI> and u&s;ing little
or no Exerci&s;e, I became at la&s;t <HI>Heavy,
Dull</HI> and <HI>Lethargick</HI> to an extream Degree,
e&s;pecially after Dinner; and the <HI>Mid&s;ummer</HI>
1723. I was &s;eiz'd with a &s;evere <HI>Symptoma|tick
Fever,</HI> which terminated in the mo&s;t
violent <HI>Eri&s;ipelas,</HI> and with the large&s;t and
fulle&s;t Bli&s;ters all over my Thighs, that I had
ever &s;een. I &s;uffered extremely in the Sympto|matick
<HI>Fever,</HI> by violent <HI>Headaches,</HI> great <HI>Sick|ne&s;&s;es</HI>
and <HI>Sinking;</HI> and having lately had two
full-bodied Patients, who had died of <HI>Mor|tifications</HI>
from that Di&s;temper, I was much
frightened at mine. My Blood was then, I
<PB N="345" REF="379">
found, one continued <HI>impenetrable Ma&s;s</HI> of
<HI>Glew,</HI> and my <HI>Eri&s;ypelatous</HI> Inflammations
were &s;o painful (and attended with <HI>Lowne&s;s,
Sinking</HI> and <HI>Inquietude</HI>) as reduc'd me to the
very la&s;t Degree of Mi&s;ery. I had always
re&s;olv'd, upon any great Change in my
Health, to return to my <HI>old Friends, Milk</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables,</HI> and to ab&s;tain from Wine in
a great mea&s;ure, provided I had but &s;uffici|ent
Warning by any <HI>Chronical</HI> Illne&s;s. I
then made a long Journey in a Coach, and
liv'd on <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>white Meats,</HI> drinking
<HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> Water, and only a <HI>Pint</HI> of Wine a
Day, by which I was &s;omewhat relieved,
tho' not &s;o much as to conquer my Fears or
my Sufferings; &s;o that having continued this
Method for two Months, I began gradually
to le&s;&s;en the Quantity of my <HI>Animal</HI> Food
&s;till more, and at la&s;t, to live entirely on <HI>Milk</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables:</HI> This, in &s;ome Time, made my
Spirits va&s;tly better; but &s;till, for two Years,
I was regularly and <HI>periodically</HI> &s;eiz'd every
third Month, almo&s;t to a Day, with this <HI>Eri|&s;ypelas,</HI>
the Symptoms of which were indeed
not &s;o grievous as at fir&s;t, tho' &s;till attended
with violent <HI>Headaches,</HI> a <HI>Symptomatick Fe|ver</HI>
for forty-eight Hours before the <HI>Erup|tion,</HI>
large Bli&s;ters full of <HI>Scorbutick Ichor,</HI>
and great Lowne&s;s for the Space of a Week;
after which I recovered my <HI>pri&s;tine</HI> State.
But I was always obliged to <HI>vomit</HI> before
the Eruption, to pu&s;h it out: And relieve
the <HI>Headach</HI> and <HI>Fever:</HI> and to purge after
<PB N="346" REF="380">
it was over. Thus I went on for &s;even or
eight Months, wa&s;ting daily, but at the &s;ame
Time recovering Spirits, Activity, and the
U&s;e of my Limbs. I had all that Winter had
a &s;light Pain in the back <HI>Tendon</HI> of my left
Leg, reaching down to my Heel, which in
<HI>March</HI> following terminated in a regular Fit
of the <HI>Gout,</HI> in the Joint of my <HI>big Toe;</HI>
this confin'd me a Fortnight or three Weeks,
and it had no &s;ooner left that Place, than
it &s;eiz'd my <HI>Shoulder Joints,</HI> where it con|tinued
for above a Month. I pa&s;s'd the
re&s;t of the Summer pretty tolerably, but
for the&s;e <HI>periodical</HI> Returns of that <HI>Eri&s;ypelas,</HI>
which continued very regular, above two
Years. About the <HI>Michaelma&s;s</HI> of that Sum|mer,
I was &s;eiz'd with &s;uch a perpetual
<HI>Sickne&s;s, Reaching, Lowne&s;s, Watchfulne&s;s,
Eructation,</HI> and <HI>Melancholy,</HI> continuing &s;ix
or eight Months: that Life was no longer
&s;upportable to me, and my Mi&s;ery was al|mo&s;t
extreme.</P>
<P>&sect; XI. At la&s;t, my Sufferings were not
to be expre&s;&s;ed, and I can &s;carce de&s;cribe,
or reflect on them without <HI>Horror.</HI> A <HI>per|petual
Anxiety</HI> and <HI>Inquietude,</HI> no <HI>Sleep</HI> nor
Appetite, a con&s;tant <HI>Reaching, Gulping,</HI> and
fruitle&s;s Endeavour to <HI>pump</HI> up <HI>Flegm, Wind,</HI>
or <HI>Choler</HI> Day and Night: A <HI>con&s;tant Colick,</HI>
and an ill Ta&s;te and Savour in my Mouth and
Stomach, that overcame and <HI>poi&s;oned</HI> every
<PB N="347" REF="381">
Thing I got down; a <HI>melancholy Fright</HI> and
<HI>Pannick,</HI> where my Rea&s;on was of no U&s;e to
me: So that I could &s;carce bear the Sight of my
Patients, or Acquaintances, that had not been
daily about me, and yet could not bear being
a Moment alone, every In&s;tant expecting the
Lo&s;s of my <HI>Faculties</HI> or <HI>Life;</HI> and &s;urely no|thing
but <HI>Almighty Power</HI> pre&s;erved them
both, &s;uch as they are. I had a con&s;tant
violent Pain in the <HI>Neck</HI> of my <HI>Stomach,</HI> and
was obliged almo&s;t every Week to take a
&s;trong <HI>Emetick,</HI> without which I could not
enjoy a Moment's Ea&s;e, be&s;ides daily urging
with my Finger, or chewing <HI>Tobacco.</HI> I had
Recour&s;e to my old Friend the <HI>Quinquina</HI> in
&s;everal Shapes, but to no Purpo&s;e. I drank
<HI>Bath</HI> Waters without &s;en&s;ible Relief. I
went out in my Chariot, in the colde&s;t Winter
Weather, for four Hours every Day; but
nothing mitigated my Suffering. At la&s;t I
tried the <HI>Foetids,</HI> the <HI>Gums,</HI> the <HI>Volatiles</HI> and
<HI>Vipers</HI> Powders (not indeed regularly and
&s;teadily) but all in vain. In $ine, I had Re|cour&s;e
to <HI>Opiats,</HI> which I knew were a &s;low
<HI>Poi&s;on;</HI> but one wil &s;tick at nothing for
even a Moment's Re&s;pite in &s;uch Extremi|ties.
This, in&s;tead of relieving, aggravated
my Mi&s;eries; for &s;o &s;oon as the &s;tupifying
and confounding Effects of them were over,
my Anxiety and Sinking was &s;o extream
after, that I was forced to repeat them &s;o
often, and in &s;o large Do&s;es, that I was ju&s;t|ly
<PB N="348" REF="382">
afraid, le&s;t by their becoming &s;o familiar,
they would, at la&s;t, lo&s;e even the poor, di|&s;tracting,
uncomfortable Relief they afforded
me; yet all this Time, I attended indeed (in
a Manner) the Bu&s;ine&s;s of my <HI>Profe&s;&s;ion,</HI> and
took <HI>Air</HI> and <HI>Exerci&s;e</HI> regularly in the Day|time;
but in &s;uch a wretched, dying Condi|tion
as was evident to all that &s;aw me. I had
many different and contradictory Advices,
from my Friends and Acquaintances, who
ob&s;erved my Mi&s;ery; but I neither could,
from the Nature of my Di&s;temper, nor from
the ill Effects the &s;malle&s;t Tryals of any
Thing propo&s;ed, were attended with, conti|nue
them any time. I well knew my Ca&s;e was
the <HI>Gouty</HI> and <HI>Eri&s;ypelatous</HI> Matter retired, and
drawn into my Stomach and Bowels: I like|wi&s;e
knew, that if I took hot and &s;trong
Medicines and <HI>Cordials</HI> to drive them out (as
is u&s;ual) I &s;hould thereby lo&s;e all the Pains
I had taken, and the Benefit of the Ab&s;ti|nence
I had gone through, to thin and &s;weeten
my Blood and Juices, to open the Ob&s;truc|tions,
and to obtain an <HI>Extirpative Cure,</HI> if
po&s;&s;ible there might be Time enough remain|ing
for it; but the wor&s;t was, my <HI>Stomach</HI>
would not retain any Medicine, for they
had a pre&s;ent ill Effect, by making my Suf|ferings
more inten&s;e; however, I was per|&s;waded
then to take a little &s;trong warm Wine
made with <HI>Spices,</HI> and to have Bread and
this Wine mixed for my Dinner: Conti|nuing
<PB N="349" REF="383">
Tea, with boiled Milk, and toa&s;ted
Bread for Breakfa&s;t; but all this time I had
no &s;en&s;ible Relief. My <HI>Family</HI> and <HI>Relations</HI>
pre&s;&s;ed me extreamly to go for <HI>London</HI> (where
I had not been for many Years) to pa&s;s the
Dead of the Winter among my old Acquaint|ances
and Friends, for Amu&s;ement and Diver|&s;ion
only: but to this I was extreamly aver&s;e,
apprehending I might be teized to change
my <HI>Regimen,</HI> and &s;neer'd at by the Free-livers;
and being convinced, from former
Experience, that if my Life was to be &s;av'd,
it was only by this <HI>Regimen,</HI> at lea&s;t, if
my Time of <HI>Di&s;&s;olution</HI> was come, I knew
I &s;hould die under le&s;s Mi&s;ery by it, than
by any other Means.</P>
<P>&sect;. XII. HOWEVER, at la&s;t, to prevent
<HI>Friendly Teazing,</HI> and the <HI>Character</HI> of Ob&s;ti|nacy,
I promi&s;ed to be <HI>pa&s;&s;ive,</HI> and to be go|verned
by them; &s;o in the Beginning of <HI>De|cember</HI>
1725, I &s;et out, and with great Diffi|culty
got to <HI>London.</HI> Next Day after my Arri|val,
I &s;ent to the very <HI>learned, ingenious,</HI> my very
<HI>worthy Friends,</HI> Dr. <HI>Arbuthnot,</HI> and Dr. <HI>Brox|holm,</HI>
who, at my De&s;ire, brought with them
Dr. <HI>Mead</HI> and the <HI>late</HI> Dr. <HI>Freind,</HI> with Dr.
<HI>Douglas</HI> and Dr. <HI>Campbel,</HI> all <HI>Gentlemen</HI> of
great Learning, Worth and Experience.
They unanimou&s;ly advi&s;ed me to try a warm
<HI>chalybeat</HI> Electuary, with <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Waters,
and by all Means to drop my <HI>Opi$ts;</HI> for as
<PB N="350" REF="384">
to <HI>Cathartics,</HI> which were mentioned, they
&s;o exceedingly &s;unk and ruffled me, that I
was always dying under them. This <HI>Method</HI>
being rea&s;onable and ju&s;t, I followed &s;ome
time, continuing tho' the &s;ame <HI>Regimen of
Diet:</HI> And tho' &s;ome of tho&s;e <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and
others thought I might have then, with
Safety, changed my <HI>Diet,</HI> very &s;lowly, at lea&s;t.
Yet having pa&s;&s;ed through the &s;ame <HI>Cour&s;e</HI>
twenty Years before, and having &s;uffered to
&s;uch Extremity, and in a younger and more
vigorous Part of my Life, and run the utmo&s;t
Hazard, even by a very &s;low and gradual
<HI>Change:</HI> And knowing the Danger others had
undergone by the like <HI>Change;</HI> I was firmly
re&s;olved to continue my <HI>Regimen,</HI> happen
what wou'd; and indeed when all this was
repre&s;ented to the&s;e <HI>Gentlemen</HI> and <HI>my other
Friends,</HI> none had the Courage to pre&s;s it;
much le&s;s to urge it, in &s;o <HI>in&s;olent</HI> and <HI>&s;neer|ing</HI>
a <HI>Manner</HI> as &s;ome, who ridicule all <HI>Shame</HI>
and <HI>Truth,</HI> have thought fit fal&s;ly to repre|&s;ent
it. I have once or twice, in nine or ten
Years, been tempted to eat an Ounce or two
of young tender <HI>animal</HI> Food, but with &s;uch
&s;en&s;ible Suffering and Oppre&s;&s;ion after, that I
have re&s;olved never more to make the Tryal:
And I have known others much younger than
I, on whom a <HI>potch'd Egg,</HI> under &s;o long and
&s;trict a <HI>vegetable Diet,</HI> for an <HI>Epileptick</HI> Ca&s;e,
has had a di&s;agreeable Effect. As the Winter
advanced, meeting with &s;ome true <HI>Sylphi$m</HI>
<PB N="351" REF="385">
to join with the&s;e other Medicines, I became
&s;omewhat ea&s;ier and more chearful by the
Spring, though almo&s;t every Month I was
forc'd to have Recour&s;e to a &s;trong <HI>Vomit</HI> to
clear the <HI>Glands:</HI> But by the&s;e warm <HI>chaly|beat</HI>
Medicines, and the <HI>vitriolick</HI> Waters,
and drinking near half a Pint, or rather
a Gill of <HI>Port</HI> a Day, I had, by the <HI>May</HI>
following, forced out &s;uch a Fit of an
<HI>Eri&s;ypelas,</HI> as the be&s;t and mo&s;t experienced
Surgeons (who then treated me) had never
&s;een the like: the whole <HI>Leg, Thigh,</HI> and
<HI>Abdomen</HI> being <HI>tumified, incru&s;ted,</HI> and <HI>burnt</HI>
almo&s;t like the Skin of a <HI>roa&s;ted Pig:</HI> And
&s;uch a Quantity of <HI>Ichor</HI> i&s;&s;ued from it, as
was not to be expre&s;&s;ed; at la&s;t it ended in
a <HI>&s;inuous Ulcer</HI> in my Leg, which confined me
near two Months, and the <HI>&s;inking Effects</HI>
were not quite worn off in almo&s;t &s;ix; how|ever
I pa&s;&s;ed the next Winter again in <HI>Lon|don</HI>
much better, and in the Spring was ex|treamly
<HI>ea&s;y, active</HI> and <HI>gay;</HI> for from the
Time of this la&s;t and mo&s;t &s;evere <HI>eri&s;ipelatous
Paroxy&s;m,</HI> I reckon I mended daily: For this
had the &s;ame Effect upon my whole Con&s;ti|tion
now, as the <HI>depuratory Fever</HI> before-mentioned
had then, both being the <HI>Cri&s;$e</HI>
and <HI>Period</HI> of my Di&s;temper, and the Begin|ning
of my perfect Recovery. This was
above &s;ix Years &s;ince, tho' I became not per|fectly
well till the Spring following, and in|deed
<PB N="352" REF="386">
not ab&s;olutely &s;o, till about four Years
ago.</P>
<P>&sect;. XIII. UPON the Whole, as in my
<HI>Nervous</HI> and <HI>Scorbutical</HI> Di&s;order, I had
continued my <HI>Milk, Seed,</HI> and <HI>Vegetable</HI>
Diet, with proper Evacuations, for above
two Years, before I obtain'd a compleat Re|covery,
&s;o in this la&s;t Illne&s;s, I had ob&s;erv'd
the &s;ame Regimen near twice as long, be|fore
my Health was perfectly e&s;tabli&s;hed;
being in the fir&s;t Ca&s;e twenty Years younger
than in the la&s;t; tho' my Exce&s;&s;es were
much more violent in the Time preceding
my fir&s;t Illne&s;s, than between that and the
la&s;t, having, during all that Interval, &s;carce
once been heated with Wine, and never eat|ing
<HI>Animal Food</HI> but once a Day. But my
exceeding Bulk and Want or Inability of
nece&s;&s;ary Exerci&s;e, and a continued, tho' tem|perate
Fulne&s;s, with the Difference of twenty
Years in my Age, concurred to make the
<HI>Paroxy&s;ms</HI> even more di&s;tracting and painful,
as well as more durable in this la&s;t <HI>Ca&s;e.</HI>
And after all I have &s;aid of my Exce&s;&s;es,
e&s;pecially in Liquor, if it be con&s;idered, that
I was near <HI>thirty</HI> Years Old before I drank
&s;carce any thing &s;trong, at lea&s;t, for a Con|tinuance:
and that for near one half of the
Time &s;ince, <HI>viz.</HI> from <HI>Thirty</HI> to <HI>Sixty,</HI> I
&s;carce drank any &s;trong Liquor at all: It
will be found, that upon the Whole, I
<PB N="353" REF="387">
drank very little above a Pint of Wine, or
at mo&s;t, not a Quart one Day with ano|ther,
&s;ince I was near thirty: And I was ne|ver
&s;ix times in my Life overtaken with
Wine, and &s;carce ever ta&s;ted any di&s;tilled
Liquors, but as a Medicine, however mix'd
or brew'd. Always believing them to be
actual <HI>Cauteries,</HI> and almo&s;t direct <HI>Poi&s;on</HI>
to an Animal Habit, from their Nature,
and the Delicacy of the <HI>animal Machine:</HI>
And during that whole Time, I &s;carce
ever eat <HI>Animal</HI> Food above once a Day. But
Temperance is a mere <HI>relative</HI> Thing; and
by much Ob&s;ervation I find, that notwith|&s;tanding
my <HI>large Size,</HI> I was not made to
bear <HI>Animal Food</HI> and fermented Liquors in
any Quantity, without &s;uffering to the la&s;t De|gree.
But I believe none will ever be brought
to &s;uch a <HI>Regimen</HI> as mine is now, without
having been fir&s;t extremely Mi&s;erable; and
I think Common Life, with Temperance,
is be&s;t for the Generality, el&s;e it would not
be Common. But extreme Ca&s;es require ex|traordinary
Remedies.</P>
<P>&sect;. XIV. I FOUND I never began to reco|ver
fully and la&s;tingly, either fir&s;t or la&s;t,
till my Blood had entirely lo&s;t its <HI>Size</HI> (which
I came to know by an accidental Occa&s;ion
for opening a Vein) and all the former Ha|bit
(except the mere <HI>Organical Membranes
and Solids</HI>) was wa&s;ted, wore away, and
<PB N="354" REF="388">
di&s;charged by <HI>Evacuations,</HI> Diet and Exer|ci&s;e;
for I had wa&s;ted and lo&s;t of my former
Size and Bulk, in this la&s;t Illne&s;s, almo&s;t one
third in Weight and Mea&s;ure: and had pa&s;s'd
through a State of entire bodily <HI>Purification,</HI>
and a true <HI>Cyclus Meta&s;yncriticus,</HI> both fir&s;t and
la&s;t, before I began to recover and fill up
again. <HI>Vomits</HI> were the fir&s;t Evacuations
that with any Relief, or without infinite
<HI>Ruffling,</HI> I could bear: and &s;o &s;oon as I could
endure gentle Stomach <HI>Cathartics,</HI> I began
already to mend; but no &s;ooner had I reco|vered
any Degree of Ea&s;e and Freedom, but
my Appetite and Dige&s;tion returned to their
u&s;ual Stint towards my new Food, and <HI>Vomits</HI>
were no longer nece&s;&s;ary nor indeed u&s;eful,
they being only required to &s;queeze the in|ternal
<HI>Glands,</HI> open <HI>Ob&s;tructions,</HI> and pump
up the <HI>Wind, Choler,</HI> and <HI>Phlegm</HI> from the
<HI>Alimentary Tube</HI> when lodged there.</P>
<P>&sect;. XV. UPON any Accident, Di&s;order,
or any greater Oppre&s;&s;ion or Anxiety than
ordinary, ari&s;ing naturally in the Cour&s;e of
the Cure, I found that living even much
<HI>$ower</HI> under my <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>Vegetable Diet</HI> for
two or three Days at lea&s;t, would always
help me out again, and re&s;tore me to my
u&s;ual <HI>Serenity</HI> and <HI>Freedom,</HI> (for I found
Temperance nece&s;&s;ary even in this, as well
as a higher Diet, tho' Exce&s;&s;es were not at|tended
with &s;uch <HI>extreme Suffering</HI>) and
<PB N="355" REF="389">
&s;carce any time le&s;s than three Days would do
it; for tho' all my Symptoms were le&s;s &s;evere
under it, yet I found by indulging a <HI>fal&s;e
Appetite,</HI> or a <HI>liquori&s;h Palate</HI> even in it,
that I exa&s;perated the&s;e <HI>milder Symptoms,</HI> at
lea&s;t to &s;uch a Degree, as was &s;ufficient to
convince me, that the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>dige&s;tive
Organs</HI> were the primary and principal <HI>De|linquents,
Sufferers,</HI> and <HI>Patients,</HI> in mo&s;t, if
not in all <HI>nervous</HI> Symptoms, tho' this was
not always &s;en&s;ible and manife&s;t: And that
by u&s;ing them tenderly, and ab&s;temiou&s;ly, all
the re&s;t of the <HI>Animal Functions</HI> were propor|tionably
reliev'd. And, I think, I never once
departed from the <HI>Simplicity</HI> of the <HI>Alimentary
Go&s;pel,</HI> and indulged in <HI>Onions</HI> and <HI>Garlick,
viz.</HI> the <HI>poignant, hard, &s;picy,</HI> or <HI>unctuous</HI> Vege|tables,
with much Butter or Oil, or in a greater
Quantity than u&s;ual, even of the common ones
for any Time, but that I &s;uffered Pains and
Penalties in Proportion.</P>
<P>&sect;. XVI. I FOUND all my <HI>Re&s;tle&s;ne&s;s, Watch|ings,</HI>
and want of Tranquillity or found
Sleep, to be owing entirely to <HI>Inflation,</HI> &s;tored
up <HI>Wind</HI> and <HI>Flatulence,</HI> con&s;tantly urge|ing
and &s;timulating as it were with its <HI>Spring,
Ela&s;ticity</HI> and <HI>Points,</HI> the tender &s;en&s;ible
<HI>Membranes</HI> of the <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>Guts,</HI> and
the whole <HI>Glands</HI> and <HI>Membranes</HI> of the
<HI>Abdomen;</HI> for upon <HI>Fa&s;ting</HI> &s;ome Time, <HI>Eating</HI>
very little, or very thin, light and &s;oft Food,
<PB N="356" REF="390">
or on u&s;ing a great deal of more <HI>Exerci&s;e,</HI> to
urge the <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI> and to throw off and
di&s;charge this <HI>Wind, Vapour,</HI> or <HI>&s;harp Steams,</HI>
I found my Sleep return in a greater Degree;
and I am bold to &s;ay, where no manife&s;t
<HI>Fever, acute Pain, interrupted Circulation,</HI>
or <HI>&s;poil'd Organ</HI> is the Ca&s;e, that want of
Sleep and natural Re&s;t proceeds from the
Di&s;orders of the <HI>Alimentary Tube,</HI> continual|ly,
tho' perhaps not &s;en&s;ibly, &s;timulated by
this <HI>Vapour.</HI> And hence it is, that <HI>A&s;&s;$|foetida,
Volatiles, Foetid Gums,</HI> gentle <HI>Diapho|reticks</HI>
and <HI>Opiats,</HI> procure Sleep; merely
by encrea&s;ing and promoting <HI>Per&s;piration,</HI>
and expelling this twitching <HI>Vapour</HI> or <HI>Steam,</HI>
for which they ought chiefly to be u&s;ed;
and this &s;erves to &s;hew the Nece&s;&s;ity, and
infinite Preference of Exerci&s;e to all <HI>Anodyne</HI>
Medicines what&s;oever, and even to <HI>Cordials,
Diaphoreticks</HI> and <HI>Volatiles,</HI> except as a pre|&s;ent
Relief, <HI>Whip</HI> or <HI>Spur</HI> only.</P>
<P>&sect;. XVII. WANT of Appetite and Dige&s;tion
mo&s;tly proceeds from the Thickne&s;s, Gro&s;&s;|ne&s;s,
and Vi&s;cidity of the Juices and of the
whole Ma&s;s of Blood; every <HI>Vein</HI> and <HI>Ar|tery</HI>
thereby becoming like &s;o many <HI>Black-Puddings,</HI>
or leathern Pipes, &s;tuff'd with a
<HI>glewy</HI> or tenacious Fluid: by which all
the <HI>Secretions</HI> being more &s;canty, and le&s;s
being expended by them, le&s;s can be re|ceived
thro' the <HI>Lacteals</HI> into the Blood;
<PB N="357" REF="391">
which &s;hews the Nece&s;&s;ity and Preference of
the <HI>ponderous</HI> and deob&s;truent Medicines to
procure an Appetite and Dige&s;tion, even to
<HI>Bitters, Cordials</HI> or <HI>Chalybeats</HI> them&s;elves:
who&s;e Efficacy principally lies in &s;trengthen|ing
the Solids, and winding up and contract|ing
the <HI>Fibres,</HI> to make them play, and com|pre&s;s
with greater Force the circulating Fluids,
which can never &s;olidly an&s;wer the Intention
of <HI>Dige&s;tion</HI> and <HI>Appetite.</HI> And accordingly
by <HI>Quick&s;ilver, Aethiops, Cinnabar,</HI> but e&s;pe|cially
by <HI>Mercurius Alcali&s;atus,</HI> and other <HI>mer|curial</HI>
Preparations, I have been always able to
cure the Di&s;orders of the <HI>Alimentary Tube,</HI> In|appetency,
and even <HI>Colicks,</HI> when &s;carce any
other Method or Medicine could effect it.
And &s;eeing, by a thin, cool <HI>Milk</HI> and <HI>vegetable
Diet</HI> long continued, I found my Appetite
full as good as before, and likewi&s;e my
<HI>Strength, Activity, Fle&s;h</HI> and <HI>Complexion,</HI> and
every <HI>Power, Organ</HI> and <HI>Faculty</HI> re&s;tor'd to as
great a Degree as I could ju&s;tly expect at my
Time of Life, had no &s;uch Di&s;order ever hap|pen'd;
it appears that the <HI>Fluids</HI> are chiefly
and primarily the Seat of Di&s;orders: and
that when they are &s;ufficiently <HI>&s;weetened</HI> and
<HI>diluted,</HI> they generally leave the <HI>Solids</HI> with a
&s;ufficient Force and Spring to play &s;uch
Fluids off, and circulate them fully and free|ly;
and then all the <HI>Animal Functions,</HI> and
the Exerci&s;e of the Faculties will again be
plea&s;antly and regularly performed, as in
<PB N="358" REF="392">
perfect Health; for good Health &s;uppo&s;es
this State: which does not depend on the Kind
of the <HI>Diet,</HI> though <HI>mechanical</HI> Strength does&punc;
So that &s;uch a <HI>Diet</HI> is only proper for the
<HI>thinking, &s;peculative</HI> and <HI>&s;edentary</HI> Part of
Mankind, and not for the <HI>active, laborious</HI>
and <HI>mechanical.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. XVIII. AFTER I began to recover, I
found little Alteration from <HI>Cold</HI> or <HI>Heat,
Wet</HI> or <HI>Dry, Summer</HI> or <HI>Winter</HI> Sea&s;ons,
e&s;pecially as to my <HI>Appetite, Spirits</HI> or
<HI>Sleep;</HI> at lea&s;t not near &s;o much as I u&s;ually
found in my be&s;t Health on the&s;e Occa&s;ions,
under a full <HI>animal</HI> and <HI>fermented</HI> Liquor
<HI>Diet;</HI> &s;o that I can &s;it, and walk, and be
abroad in all Weathers, Sea&s;ons or Times of
the Year, Day or Night, without much
Dread or Hazard of Cold, and with little
Difference of Cloathing, providing I keep
my <HI>Stomach</HI> and <HI>chiliferous Tube</HI> clear and
clean; which often put me in mind of the
Saying of a <HI>Roman Emperor,</HI> who affirmed,

<P>&sect;. XIX. AFTER I had perfectly recovered,
ob&s;erving, that &s;till, on <HI>liquid, &s;lippery</HI> Stools,
from craming I was &s;omewhat le&s;s lively and
chearful, and rather more <HI>grip'd</HI> and <HI>in|flated,</HI>
I re&s;olved to change my <HI>half Pint</HI> or
<PB N="359" REF="393">
<HI>Gill</HI> of <HI>Port</HI> at Dinner, into the &s;ame Quan|tity
of <HI>Florence,</HI> thinking it more binding
and <HI>a&s;tringent.</HI> I ate at the &s;ame Time a
good deal of more <HI>Butter</HI> with my Ve|getables,
and Plenty of <HI>old rich Chee&s;e;</HI>
and likeing <HI>Nuts</HI> extremely, I procur'd
from Abroad and at Home, great Plenty of
all Kinds, as <HI>Filberts, Wallnuts, Che&s;nuts,
Almonds,</HI> &amp;c. eating them in great Quanti|ties
after Dinner, by way of <HI>De&s;ert.</HI> I
went on all Winter, and for eight or ten
Months in this <HI>Regimen</HI> extremely well; and
out of <HI>Wantonne&s;s,</HI> to try what my Con&s;titu|tion
could now bear, I indulged freely (tho'
in the&s;e only) together with my u&s;ual <HI>Milk</HI>
and <HI>Vegetable Diet.</HI> But after my common,
&s;light, vegetable Fit of the <HI>Gout,</HI> (which I &s;till
have in the <HI>Spring,</HI> without nece&s;&s;ary Confine|ment,
tho' for an Hour, or altering either <HI>Re|gimen</HI>
or <HI>Cloathing,</HI> or any other Circum&s;tance,
but a Lamene&s;s for a few Days) I had fir&s;t a
Touch of my <HI>Eri&s;ypelas</HI> on my Leg; after that
I &s;eemingly catch'd Cold, and began to be &s;ick
at my Stomach, <HI>Reaching, Inflated, Low-&s;pi|rited</HI>
and <HI>Colick'd,</HI> with re&s;tle&s;s Nights, and al|mo&s;t
all tho&s;e di&s;mal <HI>Symptoms</HI> I had gone
through in my late long Illne&s;s. I &s;oon found
my <HI>Error,</HI> and that my Con&s;titution could not
bear even that &s;light <HI>Alteration</HI> without &s;evere
Sufferings. I had a violent <HI>humorous</HI> Cough,
and threw up great Quantities of gro&s;s vi&s;cid
Flegm, which I knew to be the <HI>Nuts,</HI> not
<PB N="360" REF="394">
&s;o &s;ufficiently dige&s;ted and attenuated, as to
become thin enough to circulate freely thro'
the &s;mall Ve&s;&s;els: but were thrown off, and
de&s;pumated upon the larger <HI>Emunctory</HI> and
open <HI>Glands.</HI> In a Word, I &s;uffer'd all the
Kind of Mi&s;ery I had formerly, tho' not
with quite &s;o much Violence and Duration.
I went through the former le&s;&s;er <HI>Purgation</HI>
again: Repeated <HI>Vomits,</HI> took frequent Sto|mach
<HI>Purges,</HI> chew'd <HI>Bark,</HI> return'd to the
Simplicity of my former <HI>Regimen,</HI> le&s;&s;ening
their Quantities, and drinking no Wine
(which I now have dropped for ever, but as
others u&s;e <HI>Spirits,</HI> for a <HI>Cordial,</HI> if wanted)
and drinking fir&s;t <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and then <HI>Bath,</HI> and
after <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water, as the Defluxion abated;
by the&s;e Means I got quite well in about three
Months, <HI>viz.</HI> in the <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> after; and &s;ince
that Time, I thank GOD, I have gone on in
one con&s;tant <HI>Tenor</HI> of Diet, and enjoy as good
Health, as, at my Time of Life (being now
<HI>Sixty</HI>) I, or any Man, can rea&s;onably expect,
and have learned that young tender animal
Food is le&s;s dangerous, in a &s;mall Quantity,
than <HI>hard, hot, &s;picy</HI> and <HI>oily</HI> Vegetables.</P>
<P>&sect;. XX. I KNOW not if it be worth the
mentioning, that during my <HI>Recovery,</HI> about
four Years ago, I was thrown, or rather
threw my&s;elf, out of my <HI>Chariot</HI> (upon the
Fore-Hor&s;es being frighted, and the Coach|man
being thrown off his Box) and falling
<PB N="361" REF="395">
on my Head, was taken up dead and &s;en&s;e|le&s;s,
being wounded in my <HI>Temple,</HI> and the
Wheels of the Chariot having entirely &s;hav'd
my <HI>Eye-Brow.</HI> But on being blooded, I
found my Spirits and Stomach mo&s;tly affected
with it. I grew, for &s;ome &s;hort Time, low,
feeble, and lo&s;t my Appetite; but in two or
three Months recovered to a <HI>Miracle,</HI> from
what would have kill'd another with bad Juices,
and have continued perfectly well ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>&sect;. XXI. MY <HI>Regimen,</HI> at pre&s;ent, is Milk,
with <HI>Tea, Coffee, Bread</HI> and <HI>Butter, mild
Chee&s;e, Salladin, Fruits,</HI> and <HI>Seeds</HI> of all
Kinds, with tender <HI>Roots</HI> (as <HI>Potatoes, Tur|nips,
Carrots</HI>) and, in &s;hort, every Thing
that has not <HI>Life,</HI> dre&s;s'd, or not, as I like
it; (in which there is as much, or a
greater Variety than in <HI>animal</HI> Foods:) &s;o that
the Stomach need never be cloyed. I drink no
<HI>Wine,</HI> nor any <HI>fermented</HI> Liquors, and am
rarely dry, mo&s;t of my Food being liquid,
moi&s;t, or juicy; only, after Dinner,
I drink either <HI>Coffee</HI> or <HI>green Tea,</HI> but
&s;eldom both in the &s;ame Day, and &s;ome|times
a Gla&s;s of &s;oft &s;mall <HI>Cyder.</HI> The thinner
my <HI>Diet</HI> is, the ea&s;ier, more cheerful and
light&s;ome I find my&s;elf; my Sleep is al&s;o the
founder, tho' perhaps &s;omewhat &s;horter than
formerly under my full <HI>animal</HI> Diet: But then I
am more alive than ever I was, as &s;oon as I awake
and get up. I ri&s;e commonly at <HI>Six,</HI> and go to
<PB N="362" REF="396">
Bed at <HI>Ten.</HI> The Order I find in this <HI>Diet,</HI>
from much Experience, is, that <HI>Milk</HI> is the
lighte&s;t and be&s;t of all Foods, being a <HI>Medium</HI>
between <HI>animal</HI> Sub&s;tances and <HI>Vegetables;</HI>
dre&s;s'd <HI>Vegetables,</HI> le&s;s <HI>windy</HI> and griping, than
<HI>raw; ripe</HI> Fruit than <HI>unripe;</HI> the <HI>mealy</HI> Roots
more than the <HI>fibrous;</HI> and the <HI>dry</HI> than the
<HI>crude Vegetables.</HI> I find much <HI>Butter, Cream,
$at</HI> and oily Vegetables, and e&s;pecially <HI>Nuts,</HI>
both hard of Dige&s;tion, &s;tuffing and <HI>inflating.</HI>
When I am dry (which is rarely) I drink
<HI>Bath, Bri&s;tol</HI> or <HI>Pyrmont</HI> Water.</P>

a better than any other Method (I mean

certainly <HI>reprieve,</HI> and make the Sufferings

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AFTER all the Pains I have taken, I
have not yet got &s;o large a Share of
<HI>Enthu&s;ia&s;m,</HI> as to hope, by the&s;e my
poor <HI>Labours,</HI> to do Good to any, except, per|haps,
to a few poor, low, <HI>valetudinary, dying,
mi&s;erable</HI> Creatures, who have not the Cou|rage
<HI>magnanimou&s;ly and gloriou&s;ly</HI> to &s;uffer,
pine, and putrify. The <HI>Brave,</HI> the <HI>Bold,</HI> the
<HI>Intrepid,</HI> the <HI>Heroic,</HI> who value not <HI>Pain,</HI>
who can &s;uffer for <HI>Diver&s;ion,</HI> and who prefer
<HI>Death</HI> with a <HI>Bounce,</HI> to Life, on &s;uch Con|ditions
as I propo&s;e: and choo&s;e rather to
<HI>extingui&s;h</HI> now, than <HI>forty</HI> or <HI>fifty</HI> Years
hence, will heartily de&s;pi&s;e and pity me and
my <HI>Lucubrations. Nunquam per&s;uadebis etiam&s;i
per&s;ua&s;eris.</HI> You &s;hall never convince tho' you
convict me. I have heard of a great <HI>modern
Philo&s;opher,</HI> celebrated for his <HI>Wit, Wealth,</HI> and
<HI>high Living,</HI> who u&s;ed, in the <HI>Sun-&s;hine</HI> of his
Days, to boa&s;t, that if <HI>Temperance</HI> and <HI>Ab&s;ti|nence</HI>
could make a Man live half a <HI>Century</HI>
longer, in Gayety and Mirth, it were worth
the While then to <HI>deny</HI> one's Appetites; but
for <HI>Ten</HI> or a <HI>Dozen</HI> of Years more, it was but
a poor <HI>Purcha&s;e;</HI> and yet I have been told,
that the &s;ame <HI>Hero,</HI> when his <HI>Time came,</HI> would
<PB N="366" REF="400">
have parted with his great E&s;tate for a <HI>Re|prieve</HI>
of a few Years. I own I am one of
tho&s;e poor <HI>mean-&s;pirited Wretches,</HI> who am
contented to live as long as <HI>Nature</HI> de&s;ign'd me
to la&s;t, and de&s;ire to &s;ubmit with the utmo&s;t
<HI>Peace</HI> and <HI>Re&s;ignation</HI> I can arrive at when
that <HI>Period</HI> is expired; but for <HI>Pain, Sickne&s;s,</HI>
and e&s;pecially for <HI>Oppre&s;&s;ion, Anxiety</HI> and <HI>Low|ne&s;s</HI>
avoidable, they are my <HI>mortal Aver&s;ion,</HI> and
no Means would I refu&s;e to avoid them, but
tho&s;e, which, I am convinced, would infal|libly
bring me into greater <HI>Mi&s;ery and Suf|fering;</HI>
and yet, if I mi&s;take not my own
Nature, I have the <HI>Appetites, Pa&s;&s;ions,</HI> and
<HI>Feelings</HI> common to other Men; and I u&s;u|ally
ask my&s;elf the Que&s;tion, and look into
my own <HI>Heart</HI> for an <HI>An&s;wer,</HI> to any thing
propo&s;ed concerning human <HI>Appetites, Pa&s;|&s;ions</HI>
and <HI>Feelings</HI> that are <HI>natural</HI> and not
forced: and give little Credit to what others
&s;ay contrary to &s;uch <HI>Sentiments.</HI> It is true
indeed, there are as many and as different De|grees
of <HI>Sen&s;ibility</HI> or of <HI>Feeling,</HI> as there are De|grees
of <HI>Intelligence</HI> and Perception in <HI>human</HI>
Creatures; and the <HI>Principle</HI> of both may be
perhaps one and the &s;ame. One &s;hall &s;uffer more
from the Prick of a <HI>Pin,</HI> or <HI>Needle,</HI> from their
extreme Sen&s;ibility, than others from being run
thro' the Body; and the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> &s;ort, &s;eem to be
of the <HI>Cla&s;s</HI> of the&s;e <HI>Quick-Thinkers</HI> I have

<PB N="367" REF="401">

of his <HI>Nature,</HI> and is already determined; and
both are as various as the <HI>Faces</HI> and <HI>Forms</HI> of

be required a <HI>particular Make</HI> and <HI>Frame,</HI> both
of <HI>Mind</HI> and <HI>Body,</HI> to determine any one to
receive heartily and pur&s;ue &s;teadily this (as it

great and extream <HI>Mi&s;ery, Pain, Lowne&s;s,</HI> and
