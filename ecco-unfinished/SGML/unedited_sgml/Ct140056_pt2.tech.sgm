<P>&startq;WILL my lovely I&s;abella pardon
a deceit which had its origin in her beau|ty?
&s;uch charms would ju&s;tify the black|e&s;t
crimes. Then frown not, my fair,
on the innocent &s;tratagem which procur|ed
us perfect happine&s;s.&mdash;I married
Lady Mary purely to oblige the Earl;
&s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es but the empty title of a wife,
while my fortune, heart, and per&s;on

are devoted to my I&s;abella. Come, my
&s;weet girl, throw off this peevi&s;h virtue,
and own with me you have the better bar|gain.
Settlements are needle&s;s, when
all I call my own is yours; but I inclo&s;e
you a deed which entitles you to two
hundred pounds per ann. for your life.&mdash;As
&s;oon as I can quit this hou&s;e of
jollity, I &s;hall be with you. I&s;abella, as
you value your future happine&s;s, let no

<P>&startq;This in&s;olent epi&s;tle rou&s;ed my re|&s;entment,
and &s;ilenced each &s;ofter impul&s;e.
I went directly to Mrs. M&mdash;'s. It is im|po&s;&s;ible,
Madam, to imagine my indigna|tion,
while, with the mo&s;t dauntle&s;s ef|frontery,
&s;he unfolded the blacke&s;t &s;cene
of villainy, a &s;ham marriage, and all the
<PB N="5" REF="4">
helli&s;h arts this practi&s;ed deluder could in|vent.
She openly avowed that the cu&s;|tomer
who &s;ent for her was but pretended;
that &s;he went to inform my father, and,
by enraging a temper already too much ex|a&s;perated,
ea&s;ily induced him to accompa|ny
her, and be him&s;elf the witne&s;s of my
di&s;obedience. It was &s;he, likewi&s;e, who
prevailed upon him to bar his doors again&s;t
an unfortunate and deluded daughter.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Con&s;cious that apparent &s;toici&s;m would
deprive this malicious woman of the plea|&s;ure
&s;he promi&s;ed her&s;elf, I endeavoured to
appear as indifferent as po&s;&s;ible, while &s;he
gloried in the &s;ucce&s;sful &s;tratagem.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I left her, and $ent my faltering &s;teps
to the peaceful &s;anctuary of perfect inno|cence,
flattering my&s;elf it would afford a
ready a&s;ylum to a friendle&s;s, repentant
daughter, and tru&s;ting that a father would
forgive.&mdash;I knocked at the door, but was
inexpre&s;&s;ibly di&s;appointed to &s;ee it opened
by a &s;tranger, who told me, that Mr.
<PB N="6" REF="5">
L&mdash;had left the hou&s;e &s;ome months, and
that he believed he was gone abroad, as he
ordered all parcels brought there for him to
be &s;ent to Port&s;mouth. This was all he
could inform me. Though I had not &s;een
my father &s;ince my marriage, and he had
returned all my letters unopened, yet this
blow was entirely unexpected. Alas, I
was de&s;tined a melancholy proof, that
what we think the greate&s;t misfortune,
may be followed by a &s;till greater; and in
the lo&s;s of this offended parent, I was a &s;e|cond
time deceived. Robbed of the only
friend who could &s;creen me from an ill-na|tured
world, or admini&s;ter a ray of com|fort
to my bleeding heart, together with
the wounding reflection that I had con&s;ign|ed
him to &s;orrow, and imbittered every
moment of his future life, augmented all
my pangs. I had no friend, no home, no
&s;helter from the &s;torms of life. Perhaps,
Madam, to this exce&s;&s;ive cruelty of for|tune,
I owe a mi&s;erable exi&s;tence. The
mind, obliged to exert it&s;elf, and con&s;ci|ous
it leans not on another for &s;upport, col|lects
<PB N="7" REF="6">
all its force; or, perhaps, all-pity|ing
heaven, in this trying hour, lent invi|&s;ible
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and enabled me to &s;u&s;tain
the mo&s;t acute afflictions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I returned to Mr. O&s;nay's lodgings,
and ordered my faithful Betty to pack up
all the things I brought from my father's.
When &s;he had fulfilled my de&s;ire, I paid
her what I owed her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Madam, &s;aid this unalterable
friend, believe not your Betty can for&s;ake
you: &s;till &s;uffer her attendance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My good girl, I go I know not
where; but whatever my &s;ituation, your
partaking my &s;ufferings will but the more
increa&s;e them; nor &s;hall you connect your
fortunes with the ruined happine&s;s of your
afflicted mi&s;tre&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In vain &s;he remon&s;trated, I was inex|orable;
<PB N="8" REF="7">
and, embracing with a flood of
tears, we parted.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Soon after &s;he was gone, I put up all
the baubles, once highly valued, as the
dear te&s;timonies of a pa&s;&s;ion I then
thought innocent, as it was delightful, and
enclo&s;ing them with his letters, and all the
remaining money I had received from him,
&s;ent it to the Earl's by a porter, whom I
ordered not to wait, even if commanded.
I then left the hou&s;e, re&s;olving never to en|ter
it, or &s;ee this faithle&s;s betrayer more.
Ordering a hackney coach to follow with
my trunk, I &s;et out in &s;earch of a ready
furni&s;hed lodging. I went into the fir&s;t
hou&s;e where I &s;aw a bill on the window,
and agreed for a two pair of &s;tai$s apart|ment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Madam, what a fate was mine,
with but one &s;hilling in my pocket, friend|le&s;s,
de&s;titute, for&s;aken! I hoped by &s;ell|ing
<PB N="9" REF="8">
my cloathes, to &s;upport my&s;elf till I
could get into &s;ervice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My landlady, a good kind of woman,
made it her bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire; and
through her a&s;&s;i&s;tance and recommendati|on,
I was received into Lady Beverley's
&s;ervice, to whom &s;he was very well known.
Since that time, my life has glided on,
though without plea&s;ure, yet exempt from
additional angui&s;h, and I wait in calm ex|pectation
of that period which will relea&s;e
me at once from life and mi&s;ery.&endq;</P>

<P>MY Fanny, were we di&s;po&s;ed to mora|lize,
where &s;hall we find a fairer &s;ubject?&mdash;That
we are le&s;s mi&s;erable, is it not
becau&s;e we are le&s;s perfect, that we have
not adorned afflictions by &s;u&s;taining them?</P>
<P>Let tho&s;e who, exulting in their own
goodne&s;s, their virtue, or their fortitude,
condemn the amiable I&s;abella; let them
con&s;ider how vain the triumph of that good|ne&s;s
which never &s;uccoured the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed;
let them glory in that virtue which never
&s;tood temptation, or that fortitude never
exerci&s;ed with &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>I have &s;ent you the whole of I&s;abella's
hi&s;tory in one packet, and am certain you
will agree with me, that it is infinitely more
<PB N="11" REF="10">
intere&s;ting than it would have been in &s;e|parate

<P>My Fanny, favour me with your reflec|tions:
<HI>I</HI> think of nothing but the faithle&s;s
Harcourt. But does not the lovely I&s;abella de|mon&s;trate,
that what we call fate or chance,
is the direction of an all-ruling provi|dence?
Of that providence, my friend,
fore&s;eeing future mi&s;ery from the &s;weet
connection, has taught me, through Har|court's
incon&s;tancy, to think no more of
him. Ah, Fanny, can your Eliza then e|ver

<OPENER>Edmond Harcourt, E&s;&abque; to Lord Charles

<P>WHY, faith, &startq;'tis &s;trange, 'tis pa&s;|&s;ing
&s;trange, 'tis pitiful, 'tis wonderous
pitiful,&endq; that I, Edmond Harcourt, till
now the mo&s;t renowned in the world for
<HI>bagatelle</HI> and <HI>gaiet&eacute; de coeur,</HI> am over head
and ears in a confounded &s;crape, which
even half the whining devils this and the
la&s;t age have produced, would have been
a&s;hamed of having fallen into. In good
truth, though tho&s;e whining devils would
find it no very melancholy affair to have a
lovely, amiable, accompli&s;hed girl, of
fortune &s;uperior to their own, declare an
attachment to them; or you perhaps,
Rainsford, at fir&s;t &s;ight, may not find any
thing in it, to de&s;troy the <HI>gaiet&egrave; de coeur</HI>
<PB N="13" REF="12">
I boa&s;ted. But marked ye not, I &s;aid of
<HI>&s;uperior fortune?</HI> and know ye not, that I
have &s;worn never to accept from a wife,
tho&s;e riches my own inheritance could not
give me? There's my pride, my feelings,
and my misfortune; but, &s;uch is my ob&s;ti|nacy,
no power on earth can make me
change my re&s;olution.</P>
<P>And yet am I not, in this &s;elf-denial,
this pride of mine, &s;hewing the ab&s;olute
incon&s;i&s;tency of human nature? Three
months ago, while I believed it impo&s;&s;ible
to make the &s;lighte&s;t impre&s;&s;ion on Mi&s;s
Montfort's heart, I was a&s;&s;iduous to exce&s;s
in my endeavours to gain it.&mdash;A letter
of hers has now fallen into my hands, in
which &s;he owns &s;he loves me&mdash;and I treat
her with indifference:</P>
<Q><L>&startq;I choo&s;e the colde&s;t words my heart to hide,</L>
<L>And cure her &s;ex's weakne&s;s thro' it's pride.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>The poor girl &s;eems rather unhappy up|on
the occa&s;ion, and hardly knows whether
or not to think it <HI>honour.</HI></P>
<Q><PB N="14" REF="13">
<L>&startq;It comes in &s;uch a que&s;tionable &s;hape.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>But tru&s;t that thirty years hence, &s;itting
with &s;ome humble friend in the man&s;ion
hou&s;e of a large e&s;tate, ju&s;t charmed with
her &s;on's alliance, or her daughter's &s;uitors,
&s;he will tell the follies of her youth, and
own&mdash;Hey, Rainsford, What &s;hall
&s;he own?&mdash;that &startq;Brutus was an honoura|ble
man.&endq; Ha! ha! ha!</P>
<P>You a&s;k what I laugh at. Why, faith,
'tis more than I can tell you; but finding
in my&s;elf a &s;trange propen&s;ity to yawn,
and concluding your ideas mu&s;t be pretty
much in the &s;ame &s;ituation, I was deter|mined
to make an attempt at the <HI>der&aacute;ng&eacute;,</HI>
and I have practi&s;ed it too much, during
the whole cour&s;e of my life, to entertain
the lea&s;t doubt of &s;ucce&s;s. That &s;ame de|rangement,
Rainsford, is the very &s;oul of
&s;ociety: who would wi&s;h for an exi&s;tence
which &s;hould &startq;one even tenor keep?&endq;
<PB N="15" REF="14">
&mdash;Not I, upon my &s;oul.&mdash;And of all
<HI>orders</HI> of beings, let me <HI>&s;hine</HI> in the di&s;|orderly.
There's my <HI>ignis fatuus,</HI> though
it mu&s;t be a devili&s;h dark night indeed
which can make it glitter.</P>
<P>Rainsford, did&s;t ever &s;ee a &s;et of &s;troll|ing
players, the head of which, deter|mined
to outdo all predece&s;&s;ors, &s;truts on
as Julius Cae&s;ar&mdash;and him&s;elf, forgetting
his razor and his ba&s;on, imagines all his
hearers do the &s;ame? But his companions
in toil cannot &s;o ea&s;ily lo&s;e the recollection
of what he was&mdash;and though deceived
him&s;elf, and <HI>generally</HI> deceiving tho&s;e who
knew the facetious Dick John&s;on, excellent
as a barber, and a companion, would ill-relinqui&s;h
him for the awkward hero.&mdash;So
I, &s;ometimes imagine the charming
Eliza preferred the &startq;Man of Feeling,&endq; to
the &startq;Man of Honour.&endq;</P>
<P>I pa&s;s my time, though very agreeably&mdash;very
much at my ca&s;e too, for a man in
<PB N="16" REF="15">
love. Edwards, William&s;on, and &s;ome
other very good &s;ort of fellows, are in
town: I traver&s;e the park, and lounge in
the coffee-hou&s;e with them: &s;ometimes e&s;|cort
the ladies to Vauxhall and Mary-bone:
pretty often contrive to meet the
Montforts; then &s;wear it was the luckie&s;t
accident in the world; teaze the poor girl
a little, not from ill-nature upon my &s;oul,
for I doat upon her, but for the dear de|light
of &s;eeing &s;he &s;till loves me; in return
for which I let her &s;ee that I treat no other
woman with more attention.</P>
<P>One would &s;wear, Rainsford, you had
fallen in love with me too, that I &s;hould
thus think my&s;elf at liberty to plague you.
I am convinced my letter mu&s;t be extreme|ly

<P>YES, Richmond, I have this moment
wrote the important letter, which invites
my Emilia to my arms, and have unfold|ed
thy too &s;ucce&s;sful plot. Dare not to re|dicule
the remaining honour that dictated
the avowal, Had you been witne&s;s to the
a&s;toni&s;hing alteration in my lovely girl,
even thy hardened heart mu&s;t have relent|ed,
and have dried the mi&s;taken tear which
flowed for a friend's unkindne&s;s. The

were it po&s;&s;ible to place my Emilia in the
&s;ituation from which my arts occa&s;ioned
her removal, to rein&s;tate her in Lady A&s;h|by's
favour, I would with tran&s;port forego
<PB N="18" REF="17">
every gratification I promi&s;e my&s;elf; but
Mrs. Burton informs me, that my mother,
finding we &s;et off together, vowed never
more to receive her.&mdash;&startq;Receive who?&endq;

the deluded Emilia, while the malicious
part of the world, ever ready to &s;atirize
the virtue they cannot imitate, condemn
the amiable girl.&mdash;I am all impatience

you too deceived by the injurious calumny
of a malevolent world?&mdash;Cruel girl!
this is indeed a barbed arrow that has &s;unk
deeper into the &s;oul of your once favoured
Emilia than all her other misfortunes: a
misfortune too clearly evident to admit a
&s;hadow of hope; for had illne&s;s prevented
your writing, &s;ome friend had undertaken
the ta&s;k of comfort, and alleviated the &s;or|rows
of an ill-fated girl, alike unknowing
real guilt, and imputed crimes.</P>
<P>Why do I take up my pen, &s;ince I have
no rea&s;on to expect you will receive my

George A&s;hby has made di&s;honour|able

<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
Unpracti&s;ed in the deceits of man. My
fond imagination pictured his mind lovely

<P>Engaged to Lady Harriet, what had I

<P>In the fir&s;t emotion Sir George's letter

was he who, through the means of Mrs.
Burton, infu&s;ed &s;u&s;picions of my carrying
on an intrigue with him, into the mind of
Lady A&s;hby&mdash;and it was <HI>he</HI> intercepted
my tale of &s;orrow to you. But when I
<PB N="24" REF="23">
reflected on the balm the confe&s;&s;ion poured
into my &s;oul, that Lady A&s;hby would one
day be undeceived, and that my Henriet|ta

but I could not re&s;i&s;t the de&s;ire I felt of
wounding him to the very &s;oul.</P>

dropping from my trembling hand&mdash;Sleep

read, or walk, or eat with &s;atisfaction,
and I feel within me an a&s;&s;urance of a
&s;peedy deliverance from this &s;cene of trou|ble.
Still is my re&s;olution of not letting
this reach you till after my decea&s;e, the
&s;ame. The &s;ight of you, was you kind
enough to fly to my a&s;&s;i&s;tance, would only
make me regret leaving a world which

<P>I &s;aid, I was not yet in the &s;tate I wi&s;h|ed,
begged he would not yet think of &s;ee|ing
me.&mdash;That when it was out of the

me, which would &s;oon be the ca&s;e, a note

expect him in&s;tantly to obey the &s;ummons.</P>

<OPENER>Mr. Willmott to Mi&s;s Lucy Montfort.</OPENER>
<P>AFTER &s;o long an ab&s;ence, will Mi&s;s
Montfort &s;till own her once loved Will|mott?
Has &s;he not rather yielded to a
more amiable, a wealthier victor, and for|got
the hone&s;t court&s;hip of the heart, in
elegance, in pomp, and plea&s;ure?</P>
<P>Your &s;i&s;ter, I hope, is as well and as
&s;prightly as ever. Your friend, Charlotte
Wat&s;on, likewi&s;e, is &s;he &s;till my advo|cate?
And is my charming Lucy as lively
and as tender as in tho&s;e delightful hours
of happine&s;s we lately knew? Say, my
love, are the &s;hades of Montfort-Hall &s;till
beautiful as when every tree afforded a
&s;helter for innocence and truth?</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
You de&s;ired an account of Bengal:
would it were in my power to obey you,
but your Willmott was never a nice ob|&s;erver.</P>
<P>Calcutta is a very populous place, and
in that part of it inhabited by the natives,
the hou&s;es are much crowded. Our Euro|peans,
indeed, live more agreeably, and
are careful to build in the mo&s;t airy &s;ituati|ons.
The &s;oil is fruitful, and the culti|vated
part, inclo&s;ed for rice grounds, makes
a very pretty appearance. The more de|&s;art
part of India, is much covered with
&s;mall &s;hrubs, which lead me to imagine
the &s;oil capable of affording many valuable
products, if it were properly managed&mdash;but
I am in expectation of being &s;oon &s;ent
up the country, when I &s;hall be able to
give you a clearer idea of this part of the
world.</P>
<P>We live here much at our ea&s;e, take ex|erci&s;e
in our verrandos, and have palan|quins
<PB N="29" REF="28">
at command; and I am &s;o well con|vinced
that it is impo&s;&s;ible, after &s;pend|ing
much time in Calcutta, to be happy
in England, that I am not ambitious of
returning.</P>
<P>I have been unfortunate, my &s;weet
friend, in all my undertakings. How,
indeed, could I be otherwi&s;e, when my
luckie&s;t planet had withdrawn its chearing
influence?</P>
<P>By the treachery of a tru&s;ted friend, I
was deprived of the wealth I had ama&s;&s;ed
with the mo&s;t careful diligence, cheated
of that which I doubted not would prove
my highe&s;t happine&s;s, as I flattered my&s;elf
the trea&s;ure would be &s;weetened by my Lu|cy's
participation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Winter, a widow of excellent for|tune,
ble&s;t with great &s;weetne&s;s of temper,
and in all the bloom of beauty, with hu|manity
peculiar to her&s;elf, relieved my
<PB N="30" REF="29">
woes. O, Mi&s;s Montfort, were it not for
her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, your Willmott had indeed
been mi&s;erable.&mdash;A thou&s;and little inad|vertencies
declare &s;he does not hate him,
declare her heart is his, her hand and for|tune
at his di&s;po&s;al&mdash;but &s;till I hope to be
happy in my Lucy's &s;ociety. O, Madam,
do not hate the man who, to maintain his
con&s;tancy for Mi&s;s Montfort, &s;acrifices
youth, beauty, and fortune.</P>
<P>I find, from my father's letters, that it
is reported I am going to be married.
Perhaps my &s;weet Lucy is mi&s;erable
through the groundle&s;s report: but do not
believe it. Were it even po&s;&s;ible for the La|dy
to whom I am given to be more amiable,
more lovely than her who fir&s;t received my
vows, I &s;hould blu&s;h to have it &s;aid Harry
Willmott was incon&s;tant.&mdash;Convinced of
this, you have no longer cau&s;e to be un|ea&s;y.
I can &s;uffer, but I will never forfeit
my word: the hand I once offered Mi&s;s
Montfort is &s;till at her di&s;po&s;al.</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="30">
It is a charming evening, and Mrs.
Winter de&s;ires I will accompany her in a
walk.&mdash;You &s;ee, my dear Lucy, we live
perfectly <HI>a l' Angloi&s;e.</HI> This the more tem|perate
part of the year is ab&s;olutely de|lightful;
and there needs but yours, and
the company of a few more female friends,
to render it a perfect <HI>paradis terre&s;tre.</HI> We
dance, we pay and receive the mo&s;t &s;ocia|ble
vi&s;its, laugh ince&s;&s;antly, and have even
our theatrical amu&s;ements. Your Henry
flouri&s;hes a perfect Theodo&s;ius, while the
lovely widow &s;hines in all the &s;ofter beau|ties
of his Athenais. But &s;he appears near
the window in her walking dre&s;s, and
looks a fairer Helen.</P>
<P>Adieu, my dear Lucy, remember me

<OPENER>Edmond Harocurt, E&s;&abque; to Lord Charles
Rainsford.</OPENER>
<P>HUZZA! Rainsford! Here's tran&s;|port
for you, my boy!&mdash;Not the &s;ober
refinements of delicate &s;en&s;ibility, with
all the long et-cetera of fine-&s;pun &s;en&s;a|tions,
but real and &s;ub&s;tantial happine&s;s:
&s;uch as none but thy mad friend can feel;
for none, before, was ever ble&s;&s;ed like him.
But if I could de&s;cend a little from the&s;e al|titudes,
and recount the&s;e amazing chan|ges,
I pre&s;ume it would be more accepta|ble
to a fellow of your gravity.</P>
<P>You know then the little expectation my
uncle's marriage left me of his fortune;
but the faithle&s;s Caroline, as if willing, by
her crimes, to occa&s;ion me that felicity her
virtue had not been great enough to ac|compli&s;h,
di&s;obliged the old gentleman &s;o
much by a <HI>faux-pas,</HI> that he has left <HI>her</HI> no|thing,
<PB N="52" REF="51">
and his e&s;tate entirely to <HI>me.</HI>&mdash;Be|hold
me then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of three thou&s;and a
year, and doubt whether I have thrown
my&s;elf at my Eliza's feet.&mdash;Yes, Rains|ford,
I flew to Lady Beverley's; and, hav|ing
the good fortune to find Mi&s;s Mont|fort
alone, poured out my whole &s;oul be|fore
her.&mdash;But gue&s;s my confidence in
her affection, when I did not, till her lips
had ratified the dear confe&s;&s;ion of her love,
declare to her my increa&s;e of riches. It
&s;eemed, I thought, rather to mortify her;
and &s;he was evidently charmed that, by
my not di&s;clo&s;ing it before, it had given
her an opportunity of evincing the &s;inceri|ty
of her affection. Dear girl! my whole
life, devoted to a return of thy goodne&s;s,
would be in&s;ufficient to accompli&s;h it.&mdash;Lady
Beverley is &s;o obliging as to appear
much plea&s;ed with the alliance, and a few
days will compleat my happine&s;s.&mdash;Do,
my Lord, quit tho&s;e groves and rivulets
which, I am &s;ure, mu&s;t have grown wea|ry
of your &s;ighs; come and be a witne&s;s
of my joys: your heart is too good not to
<PB N="53" REF="52">
bear a part in them.&mdash;Lucy Montfort
enquires for you; can you refu&s;e to come
and le&s;&s;en <HI>her &s;orrows,</HI> if you are deaf to
the entreaty of heightening <HI>my enjoyments?</HI></P>
<P>As for Caroline, I &s;hould be &s;orry if
the remembrance of the faithle&s;s mi&s;tre&s;s
&s;hould de&s;troy the re&s;pect due to the widow
of him to whom I owe my fortune, and,
what is infinitely dearer me, my Eliza.
I have therefore, in&s;i&s;ted on her accepting
five hundred a year, and a pretty little
hou&s;e enough in the town of D&mdash;,which
fell to me by my uncle's death.
She profe&s;&s;es gratitude; but it is a virtue,
and as &s;uch, never could find entrance in
<HI>her</HI> brea&s;t.</P>
<P>Adieu, Rainsford; &s;uffer me to entreat
you to be pre&s;ent at my nuptials, and ac|company
my to my &s;eat, where I &s;hall go
immediately after that ceremony which is

<P>WELL, Maria, the Marquis is at

<OPENER>Edmond Harcourt E&s;&abque; to Lord Charles
Rainsford.</OPENER>
<P>STILL Rainsford, in expectation of
the happy morn, how provoking the&s;e
lawyers! Not all my entreaties can rouze
their &s;tupidity; and they &s;ettle the deeds
with as much caution and compo&s;ure as if
I were going to marry my grandmother.
Eliza laughs at my impetuo&s;ity, and I dare
not hint a &s;u&s;picion that &s;he too regrets the
delay.&mdash;The ladies however, are &s;olicitous
to amu&s;e me (good &s;ouls!) while I receive
all their a&s;&s;iduities with the <HI>hauteur</HI> and ma|je&s;ty
of the grand Signior.&mdash;The&s;e ne|ce&s;&s;ary
delays, Rainsford, give a man infi|nite
importance. Then I lay all the blame
upon Eliza. &startq;What occa&s;ion for writings?
my whole e&s;tate is your's.&endq; I then throw
her a <HI>carte blanche</HI>&mdash;pretend to be exceed|ingly
out of humour&mdash;&s;wear at the &s;coun|drels&mdash;while
the poor girl &s;ays the kinde&s;t
<PB N="59" REF="58">
things to di&s;pel my chagrin&mdash;it vani&s;hes
in a moment, and I pre&s;s the attractive
charmer to my heart.</P>
<P>Though this a&s;&s;umed petti&s;hne&s;s may to
you appear the mo&s;t errant folly; yet, let
me tell thee, it is a &s;ource of inconceivable
plea&s;ure to thy friend. There would be no
&s;upporting the delay without it.&mdash;How|ever,
Charles, I will endeavour to atone
the former part of this letter, by relating
the prettie&s;t adventure&mdash;quite in your own
&s;tile too, your &s;hades, your brooks, your
flower-enamelled meads.</P>
<P>Know then that, on Tue&s;day la&s;t, Lady
Beverley and Lucy Montfort left Brook-Street,
and in a chai&s;e and four &s;et off for
Lady Beverley's &s;eat at Beaufort Hall, fol|lowed
by your Edmond and his Eliza.
The journey was delightful. Could it be
otherwi&s;e, in <HI>t&ecirc;te &aacute; t&ecirc;te</HI> with the lovelie&s;t
woman in the world?</P>
<P>About ten miles from Beaufort Hall, the
wheel of our chai&s;e flew off. My Eliza
<PB N="60" REF="59">
was alarmed, and the po&s;tillion, fortu|nately
di&s;covering a &s;mall thatched cottage,
within a few yards of us, I &s;upported her
thither in my arms.</P>
<P>We found the good man and his wife,
like Baucis and Philemon, happy in each
other, and &s;urveying, with plea&s;ed atten|tion,
the infant amu&s;ements of two bloom|ing
children. The hone&s;t pair gave us the
warm welcome of &s;ocial ho&s;pitality, and, re|commending
my lovely charge to their care,
I returned to look after the chai&s;e. The
&s;ervants a&s;&s;ured me it could not be well re|paired,
and that if we ventured further in
it, we were liable to more dangerous acci|dents.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagine how di&s;agreea|ble
this delay, but it was unavoidable, and
I was obliged to &s;end to the next town
(about five miles di&s;tant) for a fre&s;h equi|page.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="60">
At my return to the cottage, I found
my Eliza with a &s;miling cherub on either
knee, li&s;tening to their innocent prattle,
while the woman of the hou&s;e was bu&s;ily
preparing her frugal repa&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;Harcourt,&endq; &s;aid the &s;weet girl, I find,
&startq;by what I can gather from the&s;e little
chatterers, that they are the grand chil|dren
of our good ho&s;te&s;s.&mdash;Their mo|ther
lives near: &s;hall we accompany
them home? Surely there is &s;omething
very intere&s;ting in the&s;e little innocents!&endq;</P>
<P>I readily agreed to the propo&s;al, and
with the old woman's permi&s;&s;ion, we fol|lowed
our pretty guides.</P>
<P>We had not proceeded far, ere we
reached a cottage, mo&s;t romantically &s;eat|ed
on the declivity of a hill.&mdash;You
know, Rainsford, I have no hand at the
picture&s;que; your lively imagination, there|fore,
mu&s;t &s;upply the deficiency.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="61">
The melodious warblings of the fea|thered
&s;ong&s;ters, the fre&s;hne&s;s of the air,
the rural beauty of the &s;ituation, in&s;pired
inconceivable delight;</P>
<Q><L>&startq;For nature, here, wanton'd as in her prime,</L>
<L>And play'd at will her virgin fancies,</L>
<L>Wild beyond rule or art.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>My Eliza was never more enchanting,
never &s;o tender; and, in this &s;weet retreat,
we exchanged mutual vows of everla&s;ting
love.</P>
<P>&startq;My Eliza,&endq; &s;aid I, &startq;how delightful

&s;eem ambitious to outvie each o|ther,
and put on their gaye&s;t beauties to
attract yon roving butterfly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A pretty pa&s;toral &s;peech!&mdash;On my

in the country,&endq; and the Sylvan pen
<PB N="63" REF="62">
of rural lovers, that every tree may record
Eliza's charms.&endq;</P>
<P>By this time we had reached the arbour,
and were entering it, when Eliza &s;tarted
back, &s;urpri&s;ed at the appearance of a wo|man,
who ro&s;e immediately and acco&s;ted
us with a politene&s;s which would have en|gaged
our attention, had her &s;ituation been
le&s;s intere&s;ting. &startq;A faultle&s;s form, &s;hap|ed
by the hand of harmony,&endq; an inexpre&s;|&s;ible
elegance, rendered her infinitely at|tractive.&mdash;Our
pretty friends ran to their
delighted mother, who tenderly care&s;&s;ed
them, and led us to her cottage.&mdash;It is
impo&s;&s;ible to de&s;cribe rhe neatne&s;s of her
habitation, or the &s;implicity of her dre&s;s.</P>
<P>Her rooms were hung with her own draw|ings,
and furni&s;hed with her work: in|deed
every thing around her &s;eemed to bor|row
propriety and grace from its lovely
mi&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="63">
Eliza related our accident, and I inform|ed
her of the happine&s;s I expected.</P>
<P>She fixed her eyes upon me, and &s;ud|denly
&s;tarting up, under pretence of look|ing
out of the window, endeavoured to
conceal her emotion.</P>
<P>My Eliza followed her, begged to know
the rea&s;on of her tears, a&s;&s;ured this
charming afflicted of her fonde&s;t friend&s;hip,
and of the intere&s;t &s;he took in her con|cerns.</P>

<P>&startq;Ah, Mi&s;s Montfort, ju&s;t &s;uch was my

<P>We &s;taid with her &s;ome time, and, at part|ing,
received an affectionate invitation to
renew our vi&s;it.</P>
<P><PB N="65" REF="64">
At our return to the cottage, we found
the chai&s;e waiting, and, after rewarding
our ho&s;te&s;s for the trouble we had given,
&s;et off for Beaufort-Hall.</P>

<P>IF you po&s;&s;e&s;s an equal &s;hare of curio&s;i|ty

obliged to him for the earlie&s;t accounts
of the fair cottager.</P>
<P>Eliza went to &s;ee her la&s;t Thur&s;day, but
I was not permitted to be of the party.</P>
<P>Clarinda received her with the highe&s;t
plea&s;ure, thanked her for her generous
friend&s;hip, which &s;he acknowledged her|&s;elf
unable to return, but by di&s;clo&s;ing her
motives for this clo&s;e retirement. She de|&s;ired
I might accompany her in the ne$t
vi&s;it, and &s;he would relate her hi&s;tory;
<PB N="67" REF="66">
con&s;cious that, though prudence might
condemn, Mi&s;s Montfort and Colonel Har|court,
judging from their own hearts,
would approve her conduct. Eliza &s;taid
with her above an hour, and fixed the
next morning for $he recital.</P>
<P>We &s;et out very early, and found the
amiable Clarinda in&s;tructing her lovely
children. She de&s;ired we would excu&s;e her
ab&s;ence for a &s;hort time, as it was her in|variable
rule, to &s;pend three hours, every
morning, in the improvement of her little

<P>In a covered walk, leading to the hou&s;e,
we met Clarinda, who came in &s;earch of

<PB N="68" REF="67">
we reque&s;ted the performance of

&s;he had no claim to our friend&s;hip till &s;he

<P>We &s;eated our&s;elves beneath a &s;pread|ing

her artle&s;s tale.</P>
<P>&startq;MY parents formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an
e&s;tate, which, though it could not rai&s;e
them to luxurious affluence, afforded the
gratification of every rea&s;onable de&s;ire.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Naturally ambitious, they were not
contented with their lot, and infinitely
exceeded their income. One extrava|gance
prepared them for another, and
every repeated exce&s;s weakened re&s;i&s;t|ance.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="68">
&startq;Convinced, at la&s;t, that a longer con|tinuance
in this fatal cour&s;e, would en|tirely
deprive them of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, they
collected the remains of their &s;hattered
fortune, and intended &s;ettling in &s;ome
country village.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Chance directed them to this rural
&s;pot; it caught the youthful fancy, and,
at my pre&s;&s;ing &s;olicitation, they bought
the farm.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My father determined to devote his
hours to hu&s;bandry, while my mother
&s;pent her time between hou&s;hold oecono|my
and her daughter's education.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I was then twelve years of age. Eve|ry
&s;cene was new; and I rambled from
field to field, as inclination directed;
played with the bleating lamb, and
thought my happine&s;s unbounded.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Four years pa&s;&s;ed in this delightful
calm, when, returning home one even|ing
<PB N="70" REF="69">
later than u&s;ual, my father chid me
for delay, and told me they had a young
nobleman at the cottage, who had met
with an unfortunate accident, and by a
fall from his hor&s;e was rendered incapa|ble
of pur&s;uing his journey; adding,
that he had &s;ent his &s;ervants to a neigh|bouring
village, as his moving might
be dangerous.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My Mother never left his room; and
I prepared every medicine, and a&s;&s;i&s;ted
her as much as po&s;&s;ible, without enter|ing
the chamber.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He recovered much &s;ooner than we
expected, and in le&s;s than a fortnight
ventured down &s;tairs. It was then I
fir&s;t &s;aw him.&mdash;Ah! my friends, an

me in his fate, and from that moment
my life &s;eemed to depend on his reco|very.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="70">
&startq;He was &s;urpri&s;ed at my appearance;
wondered &s;uch charms were</P>

<P>&startq;My parents now re&s;umed their do|me&s;tic

He directed my ta&s;te in drawing, read
to me, and by his melodious voice and
agreeable manner, every &s;ubject a&s;&s;umed
fre&s;h beauties. Our evening rambles
were delightful, he vowed eternal friend|&s;hip,
and I was too artle&s;s to di&s;gui&s;e
the plea&s;ure this a&s;&s;urance gave me.
Every field wore fre&s;her verdure at his
approach, while every pro&s;pect di&s;co|vered
ten thou&s;and charms, till then
unknown.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I gave my&s;elf up to the&s;e delightful
&s;en&s;ations without re&s;erve, nor blu&s;hed
to own the innocent partiality.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My friend rewarded my parents for
<PB N="72" REF="71">
their trouble, and agreed for his board
till his health was perfectly re-e&s;tabli&s;h|ed.
How unnece&s;&s;ary the feint, while
a blooming countenance contradicted
his preten&s;ions!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;One evening my father congratulated
me on the conque&s;t of a neighbouring

as if ambitious to di&s;cover every emoti|on

<P>&startq;I begged my father to allow me a few
hours for con&s;ideration, before I returned
a deci&s;ive an&s;wer.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="72">
&startq;The reque&s;t, he &s;aid, was rea&s;onable;

<P>&startq;I curt&s;ied and withdrew, flew to an

<P>&startq;In my return to the hou&s;e, I met this

<P>&startq;My own &s;orrows vani&s;hed at the
&s;ight, or gave place to a concern for his
apparent di&s;&s;atisfaction. I ran to him,
but was unable to &s;peak. He gazed on me
for &s;ome moments with the mo&s;t flatter|ing
tenderne&s;s, then &s;eizing my trem|bling
hand, he pre&s;&s;ed it to his heart.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My Clarinda,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;how cruel
<PB N="74" REF="73">
my &s;ituation!&mdash;and, with a deep &s;igh,
hurried from me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;aw him not again that evening,
and the next morning when we were all
a&s;&s;embled at breakfa&s;t, I declared my
aver&s;ion to the thoughts of marriage;
begged my parents to indulge their
daughter, and they &s;hould find her in
all things el&s;e ever obedient to their
will.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My noble friend &s;eemed rejoiced at
the declaration, and the livelie&s;t tran&s;|port
revelled in his eyes.&mdash;My father
too kindly a&s;&s;ured me he never would
controul my inclinations; and happi|ne&s;s
was again re&s;tored to our little
circle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Our rambles were more frequent than
u&s;ual: we carried our books to the ar|bour,
and I employed my&s;elf with my
needle, while this tender friend ennobled
<PB N="75" REF="74">
my heart with examples of heroi&s;m, or
&s;oftened it with tales of love, and each
recital inforced conviction of our mutual
&s;entiments.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But why, my friends, do I dwell
with &s;uch plea&s;ure on the avowal of a
guilty pa&s;&s;ion?&mdash;Can Colonel Harcourt,
can Mi&s;s Montfort maintain a friend&s;hip
for the unwedded woman who owns her|&s;elf
a mother, nor can complain of hav|ing
been deceived?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Marquis, alarmed at his &s;on's
long ab&s;ence, wrote to him at the villa;
my friend had &s;ent his &s;ervants there,
with orders to bring his letters to our
cottage. He immediately an&s;wered his
father's letter, and gave an account of
his accident, with a promi&s;e of being
&s;oon in town. Unfortunately, the me&s;|&s;enger
he had &s;ent, informed the Mar|quis
of his &s;on's habitation, and gave a
circum&s;tantial de&s;cription of the family.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="75">
&startq;A girl about &s;eventeen, if beautiful as
the man de&s;cribed her, mu&s;t certainly
have great influence with his Forte&s;cue.
He trembled at the idea of a di&s;propor|tionate
marriage, and was alarmed for
the cottager's peace.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Marquis ordered his chai&s;e, and,
conducted by this faithle&s;s &s;ervant, ar|rived
in the evening at our peaceful ha|bitation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We were at &s;upper when he entered.&mdash;Judge,
my friends of our con&s;ter|nation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He &s;taid but a few minutes, and in|&s;i&s;ted
on my lover's accompanying him
to town.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was in vain to refu&s;e, we parted
without the power of taking a fond
farewell; and our eyes were the only
vouchers of eternal con&s;tancy.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="77" REF="76">
&startq;Every po&s;t brought letters from my
noble lover, which breathed the very
&s;oul of tenderne&s;s; and &s;ome months
after our affection was encrea&s;ed by the
mo&s;t endearing cement.&endq;</P>
<P>Here the &s;weet girl &s;hed a flood of tears,
and fondly embraced her twin prattlers.
The little innocents wondering at their
mother, jumped upon her knee; and,
with the corner of their frocks, wiped off
the pearly drops. Delighted with this art|le&s;s
te&s;timony of their love,</P>

<P>&s;he &s;eated them on the gra&s;s, and thus re|&s;umed
her narrative.</P>
<P>&startq;Soon after this, the Marqui&s;s died&mdash;and,
when I expected to &s;ee this tender

my &s;ufferings at receiving the following

<P>&startq;My affliction was too poignant to be
endured, and I was for &s;ome weeks con|fined
to my bed. Maternal love &s;till
bound me to the world. My Forte&s;cue's
<PB N="80" REF="79">
children were inconceivably dear to me,
and I re&s;olved to &s;pare no expen&s;e in
their education. This generous man has
amply provided for us, and inclo&s;ed a
deed of &s;ettlement, for five hundred
pounds a year.&mdash;I bought this little cot|tage,
and for the&s;e &s;ix years pa&s;t can
boa&s;t of perfect happine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He &s;ends for the children frequently:
and you cannot imagine the plea&s;ure I
take in preparing them for their vi&s;it,
or my ambition to unfold the opening
thought, and make &s;ome new improve|ment
again&s;t the returning day: while
my Forte&s;cue, obliged by this cruel

to teach the little prattlers &s;ome
pretty le&s;&s;on, &s;ome &s;oft me&s;&s;age of eter|nal
love, which, while they repeat, I
pre&s;s them in my arms, and &s;natch their
father's ki&s;&s;es from their lips.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thus, my friends, we live, we love
<PB N="81" REF="80">
at &s;econd hand: and if our plea&s;ures are
not &s;o tumultuous, they are infinitely
more delightful than the tran&s;ports of

<P>The &s;weet girl might have talked for

<P>We pre&s;&s;ed her to give us the plea&s;ure
of her company at H&mdash;, and I &s;aw
the propo&s;al was not di&s;agreeable to her&mdash;as
&s;he might make London in the way,
and fix her children's tutors.</P>
<P>Now Rainsford, what think you of our

<P>You are greatly obliged to me for this

<OPENER>Mi&s;s Lucy Montfort, to Mi&s;s Charlotte Wat&s;on.</OPENER>
<P>I KNOW my dear Charlotte takes &s;o
large a part in all that concerns her friends,
that my &s;i&s;ter's happine&s;s will give her the
&s;incere&s;t plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>My la&s;t informed you, that fortune had
for once reconciled love with honour,
and was to lead them la&s;t Tue&s;day to the
temple of Hymen, in the form of Ed|mond
Harcourt.</P>
<P>The bride and bridegroom were in white
for the day, the next was to &s;ee them rea&s;|&s;ume
the &s;able garb, which cu&s;tom has
rendered nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;pect.</P>
<P>I flattered my&s;elf with the plea&s;ure of
our &s;ociety being agreeably encrea&s;ed by
<PB N="84" REF="83">
Lord Charles Rainsford. Colonel Har|court
pre&s;&s;ed him much for that purpo&s;e;
but the plea he urged was, indeed, too
good a one to allow a renewed application.
It would but have revived the remembrance
of all his &s;orrows, in reminding him of
the &s;cene he &s;o lately pa&s;&s;ed in joy and tri|umph
with his Delia. His place, there|fore,
was &s;upplied by an old acquaintance
of my brother's; more elegant in per&s;on
than Lord Charles, but of a mind le&s;s amia|ble.&mdash;Let
me &s;ee if I can give you any
idea of him.</P>
<P>The well known Augu&s;tus Richmond
then, is much above the common &s;ize ra|ther
thin than otherwi&s;e, but a&s;toni&s;hingly
well formed. His face is long, his com|plexion
extremely good, and his mouth
and teeth beautiful to a degree. His no&s;e
aquiline; his eyes rather large, and of a
dark hazle; a prodigious quantity of the
fine&s;t auburn hair, which he is too fond of
to di&s;gui&s;e with powder in the country:
<PB N="85" REF="84">
add to all this, an ea&s;y elegance of man|ners;
an animated expre&s;&s;ion in his counte|nance;
lively wit in his conver&s;ation; and
you mu&s;t own, that even the mo&s;t con|&s;ummate
vanity mu&s;t leave him a divinity.</P>
<P>Who can wonder that, left in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of a large e&s;tate, ju&s;t come from the uni|ver&s;ity,
and ma&s;ter of his actions, though
not of his pa&s;&s;ions, Augu&s;tus Richmond
&s;hould have &startq;followed the multitude to do
evil;&endq; and, hurried away by the torrent
of admiration and applau&s;e his per&s;onal
attractions gained him, &s;hould forget how
much more &s;olid were the &s;atisfactions of a
well regulated mind.</P>
<P>Thus, Charlotte, did tho&s;e &s;ame per&s;onal
attractions, which, by prejudicing all
the world in his favour, would have ren|dered
their love an ea&s;ier acqui&s;ition, tend
only to render him de&s;pi&s;ed in the end; as
they taught him to re&s;t content with <HI>admi|ration,</HI>
when nothing le&s;s than <HI>adoration</HI>
<PB N="86" REF="85">
would have been his due. The former, by
its glitter, a&s;toni&s;hed the multitude; but
the latter would have rendered him dear
only to the di&s;cerning few.</P>
<P>Talk to the thoughtle&s;s Richmond of
his faults, and he will tell you,</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Great wits, &s;ometimes, may gloriou&s;ly offend,</L>
<L>And ri&s;e to faults, true critics dare not mend;</L>
<L>From vulgar bounds, with brave di&s;order part,</L>
<L>And &s;natch a grace beyond the reach of art.&endq;</L></Q>
<P>Talk to him of marriage, and he will
&s;wear he loves the whole &s;ex &s;o well he
knows not which to &s;elect from it; and
will not, for the &s;ake of particularizing
one, offend the re&s;t.</P>
<P>Talk to him of religion, and he will
a&s;k you if Cae&s;ar and Alexander were Ca|tholics;
if Alfred, the Henry's, the Ed|wards,
were Prote&s;tants; if the Duke
of Marlborough was a Mahometan.</P>
<P><PB N="87" REF="86">
Such then is Augu&s;tus Richmond, and
&s;uch as a friend, nobody can be de&s;irous of
his acquaintance; but as a companion, as
a vi&s;iter, every one mu&s;t be charmed with
him.</P>
<P>He was dre&s;&s;ed, (for dre&s;s is one of his
accompli&s;hments) the day of the wedding,
in a coat almo&s;t white, with a light tint of
&s;almon colour, frogs the &s;ame, lined with
<HI>&s;erge de &s;ois</HI> of lead colour; the wai&s;tcoat
and breeches of the &s;ame &s;ilk, worked with
two chains of gold &s;pangles thrown over
each other, and &s;ome flowers of twi&s;t,
the colour of the coat, ran carele&s;sly over
them. I a&s;&s;ure you nothing could be more
attractive than his appearance; except that
namele&s;s charm, that carele&s;s elegance,
which renders Edmond Harcourt, where|ever
he appears, the mo&s;t plea&s;ing object.
Lively before, his good fortune &s;eems
to have thrown down all bounds to his vi|vacity.
My &s;i&s;ter loves him, he doats up|on
her, and their happine&s;s &s;eems com|plete.
Amid&s;t all the&s;e joys, can I find
<PB N="88" REF="87">
time to &s;igh? Yes, my friend, the idea of
Willmott would find entrance even into
Paradi&s;e, and ca&s;t dejection there. Rich|mond,
by his good humour, tries to keep
up my &s;pirits; Harcourt &s;wears my &s;olem|nity
has checked many of his brighte&s;t
ideas; Eliza endeavours to con&s;ole me;
Lady Harriet and the fair cottager pity
me; and Lord Charles Rainsford is ex|pected
here &s;oon.&mdash;Ah, Charlotte!&mdash;But
they have &s;ent for me to accompany them
upon the water. We are to land at a de|lightful
little &s;ummer-hou&s;e, in a grove
near which the feathered &s;ong&s;ters are to
find their &s;weete&s;t notes, rivalled by the
clarinets and French horns.</P>

melancholy ideas!</P>

<P>Willing to amu&s;e my&s;elf in pa&s;&s;ing
through a country with which I was before
exceedingly plea&s;ed, I began my rout
through Burgundy. Frederick, if you was
never in that delightful province, during

region where nature has been mo&s;t profu&s;e|ly

to the town I intended, as one of the hor&s;es
was unable to go above a mile farther. To
reproach the poor devil, would have been
u&s;ele&s;s: and as I &s;aw a cottage about two

doubting &s;helter for the night. Ah! Fre|derick,
the mo&s;t inclement &s;kies had been

long remain in uncertainty? No, Frede|rick;

<P>THY friend, Frederick, was not mi&s;|taken
in his conjectures. Could he be &s;o,
when elegance was &s;tampt on every word
Lavinia uttered, and every graceful action
declared her noble birth?&mdash;My &s;weet

daughter of Lord&mdash;, who died a rebel
to his king and country.&mdash;His e&s;tate was
confi&s;cated, and his widow and child, with
a narrow income, retired to grace a cot|tage.&mdash;Here,
Frederick, they might have
lived unknown, and buried in ob&s;curity

<P>In the height of his fever, he raved in|ce&s;&s;antly
of his Emilia, and now frequent|ly
mentions her; but he talks of her, as
of a pure angelic &s;pirit, or Being of ce|le&s;tial
race.</P>
<P>I have endeavoured to engage him in
&s;ome &s;light attachment, &s;ome plea&s;ing fro|lic,
which too light to &s;ink into the heart,
<PB N="97" REF="96">
might rouze its dormant feelings: but the
attempt is vain. Shew him a fine woman,
&s;he but reminds him of Emilia: carry
him into the &s;ociety of wits, of <HI>belles e&s;prit,</HI>
and he di&s;covers &s;ome feint traces of his
Emilia: lead him to the more attractive
fair ones, where wit is tempered with di&s;|cretion,
and beauty heightened by mo|de&s;ty;
where &s;oftne&s;s is refined by &s;enti|ment,
and vivacity endeared by &s;en&s;ibility&mdash;it
is there his Emilia &s;hines&punc;</P>
<P>He delights in &s;olitary rambles, in which
I am his only companion. He plucks the
fre&s;he&s;t ro&s;e-buds, and &s;ays, &startq;My Bevill,
they boa&s;t the blooming beauties of Emilia&mdash;as
bright, almo&s;t as tran&s;ient.&endq;</P>
<P>Thus, Madam, Sir George A&s;hby &s;ome|times
gives vent to his melancholy: but
in his gayer hours, he talks with plea&s;ure
of returning to London, of &s;eeing your
Lady&s;hip, and revi&s;iting his old a&s;&s;ociates;
but Lady Harriet &s;eems bani&s;hed from his
remembrance.</P>
<P><PB N="98" REF="97">
In one of our excur&s;ions I ventured to
mention her, and hinted how much you
wi&s;hed the alliance.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Frederick,&endq; &s;aid he, would I
&startq;could oblige Lady A&s;hby!&endq; but &s;till

her! &s;he is my &s;weet companion; and

retain his hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion, or once freed,
can never prove again the fading plea&s;ure.&endq;</P>
<P>I fear, Madam, we mu&s;t give up our
flattering hopes. He &s;eems aver&s;e to mar|riage:
his Emilia was formed by nature to
enchant, and time alone can di&s;&s;ipate his
woes.</P>
<P>Sir George A&s;hby is the univer&s;al fa|vourite
in every place he vi&s;its. The

<OPENER>Mi&s;s Lucy Montfort to Mi&s;s Charlotte Wat&s;on.</OPENER>
<P>MY dear Mi&s;s Wat&s;on, in&s;truct your
friend,&mdash;teach her to refu&s;e the&s;e pre&s;&s;ing
&s;olicitations.&mdash;Lady Harriet, Clarinda, even
Harcourt and his Eliza, combine again&s;t
me, and are warm in Lord Charles Rain&s;|ford's
prai&s;es.&mdash;I own with them his Lord|&s;hip
amiable; his mind humane; while
the tendere&s;t affection dwells in his heart,
and points to &s;ocial happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Cut off from joy in the full blo&s;&s;om of
his expectations, I have learnt to pity him&mdash;But,
Ah, Charlotte, can your Lucy love
again?&mdash;yet &s;o they have decreed it.&mdash;Why,
my friend, may I not prove the &s;in|gle

is yet exempt from mi&s;ery, knows not the
<PB N="101" REF="100">
angui&s;h of contempt, the torments of ne|glected
love?</P>
<P>Since my la&s;t, our little coterie has been
agreeably encrea&s;ed. How &s;hall I intro|duce
our new acquaintance, any otherwi&s;e
than by informing you that the Marquis
of&mdash;, an admirer of Lady Harriet Som|ners,
called at H&mdash;, in the way to his
feat, to &s;ee her Lady&s;hip?</P>
<P>We were all a&s;&s;embled in the library,
and Richmond entertaining us with infinite
plea&s;antry, when our fair cottager came
running to us, with a ne&s;t of wood-pigeons
&s;he had brought from a neighbouring
grove.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted on entering the room, and
the birds fell from her trembling hand.</P>
<P>The Marquis ran to her, and threw him|&s;elf
at her feet.</P>
<P><PB N="102" REF="101">
&startq;My Clarinda!&endq;&mdash;&startq;My Forte&s;cue!&endq;
was all they could di&s;tinctly utter; and he
&s;u&s;tained the almo&s;t lifele&s;s beauty in his
arms.</P>
<P>Our attention was drawn from the lo|vers
by Lady Harriet, who ro&s;e with maje&s;|tic
loveline&s;s; and,</P>
<Q><L>&startq;Supremely happy in th'awakened power,</L>
<L>Of giving joy,&endq;</L></Q>
<P>went up to the a&s;toni&s;hed Marquis. &startq;My
friend,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;you have often a&s;&s;ured
me this hand is at my di&s;po&s;al: now e|vince
the &s;incerity of your profe&s;&s;ions.&mdash;I
give it to Clarinda; and be a&s;&s;ured that
providence, by this heaven-directed
meeting, has de&s;tined you for each other,
and cancels the guilty oath.&endq;</P>
<P>She took Clarinda's hand, and putting it
into the amiable Forte&s;cue's, &startq;my friends,&endq;
added &s;he, &startq;give me the &s;atisfaction of
hearing your lips confirm my wi&s;hes.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="102">
The Marquis gazed on Lady Harriet
with the mo&s;t grateful admiration, and once
more throwing him&s;elf on his knees, vowed
to make the fair cottager his wife. We
took the earlie&s;t opportunity of leaving the
room, and it being a charming morning,
we wandered in the wood till joined by
Forte&s;cue, Clarinda and the children. The
delighted parents &s;eemed to vie with each
other in care&s;&s;ing their little innocents.</P>
<P>Clarinda had informed the Marquis of our
fir&s;t acquaintance; and he was lavi&s;h in ac|knowledging
his obligations for our friend|&s;hip.
&mdash;Harcourt in&s;i&s;ted on his remaining
with us; and the day following was to con|firm
their union.&mdash;Lord Charles Rainsford
comes. He reque&s;ts a few minutes conver|&s;ation.&mdash;Ah,
my prophetic heart!</P>
<P>In Continuation.</P>
<P>MY God! to be mi&s;tre&s;s of the world, I
would not prove again the mournful inter|view.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="103">
He acco&s;ted me with an air of tenderne&s;s&mdash;of
expectation&mdash;an air which &s;eemed to
&s;ay, &startq;My Lucy, make me happy&mdash;yet
think not I forget the lovely Delia.&endq;&mdash;He
pre&s;&s;ed me to make a double wedding.</P>
<P>Ah, Charlotte! how much like Will|mott's
his melodious accents!</P>
<P>My heart, already &s;oftened by the dear
recollection of tho&s;e tender vows, (alas! too
fond for permanence); could I do other|wi&s;e
than weep?</P>
<P>Rainsford caught me in his arms, and
ki&s;&s;ed off the flowing tears.&mdash;&startq;My Lucy,
what means this concern? Ah, how ami|able
this tender weakne&s;s!&mdash;Your lover,
my angel re&s;pects your &s;orrows, and had
rather forfeit happine&s;s, than recall the
&s;ad remembrance.&endq;</P>
<P>I di&s;engaged my&s;elf from him.&mdash;&startq;Leave
me, my Lord&mdash;&endq;</P>

The ri&s;ing &s;igh prevented utterance; and
I could &s;ay no more. He obeyed; but</P>

If this ill-placed tenderne&s;s has

<P>LISTEN with a&s;toni&s;hment, Bevill, to
the narration of an accident which will per|haps
con&s;titute the future felicity of your
friend.</P>
<P>I was indulging my melancholy, on one
of the fine&s;t mornings you ever beheld, in
a retired part of Ken&s;ington Gardens,
when rai&s;ing my eyes (which had for &s;ome
time been bent upon the ground) at the
&s;ound of foot&s;teps, I &s;aw Lady Harriet,
the once loved Harriet, gazing at me with
a look of the mo&s;t tender concern.&mdash;With
an involuntary emotion I &s;ei$ed her hand,
and pre&s;&s;ing it between mine&mdash;&startq;Ah,
Lady Harriet,&endq; &s;aid I, &startq;is it po&s;&s;ible

<P><PB N="108" REF="107">
Surprized at my addre&s;s, &s;he fainted in
my arms.</P>
<P>Accu&s;ing my&s;elf for my indi&s;cretion, I
looked wildly round for help, and perceiv|ing
Lady Harriet's woman who was at|tending
her at a little di&s;tance, I gave her
my hat and bid her run with it to the
neare&s;t water: in the mean time I ki&s;&s;ed
tho&s;e beauteous lips a hundred times, which
had &s;o often confe&s;&s;ed they loved me&mdash;tho&s;e
dear eyes, which owned they loved
me &s;till.</P>
<P>The water &s;ucceeded as I expected; but
endeavouring by averting her face to con|ceal
her blu&s;hes&mdash;&startq;Ah, Sir George,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;why this needle&s;s concern, this
cruel caution, to re&s;tore me to an exi&s;t|ence
which I had lo&s;t with plea&s;ure in
your arms?&endq;</P>
<P>Apprehen&s;ive &s;he had &s;aid too much,
&s;he di&s;engaged her&s;elf from my embrace,

and was retiring.</P>
<P>&startq;Hold,&endq; &s;aid I, &startq;my deare&s;t Harriet;
is it &s;o lately I have found you, and will
you puni&s;h me with the lo&s;s of your
company?&endq;</P>
<P>I then entreated to e&s;cort her home, to
which &s;he con&s;ented, and ordering her
coach to drive &s;lowly, we walked by the
&s;ide of the rail, through Hyde Park. Her
&s;pirits &s;eemed to gain additional &s;trength,
and &s;he made no u&s;e of her carriage. We
parted at her door, after I had gained her
permi&s;&s;ion to attend her in the evening.</P>
<P>I flew to her before the u&s;ual hour of
vi&s;iting, and found her dre&s;&s;ed mo&s;t ele|gantly.
Never did &s;he appear &s;o lovely.</P>
<P>I entered upon the &s;ubject of my incon|&s;tancy.
She kindly &s;topped me; and, in
pity for my poor Emilia, &s;eemed to forget
<PB N="110" REF="109">
my crime. Charmed with her goodne&s;s,
I entreated her permi&s;&s;ion to devote the
re&s;t of my life to a return for it.&mdash;She
generou&s;ly accepted this divided heart;
and, oh Bevill, &s;ince the fatal a&s;&s;ignation,
never has a gleam of joy found entrance
in my brea&s;t till now.&mdash;A few days will,
I hope, entirely re&s;tore that peace to Lady
Harriet, that bli&s;s to me, which have &s;o

will bring me to the altar, where ju&s;tice
has long demanded my appearance. Time,
by bani&s;hing Emilia from my remem|brance,
will &s;trengthen Lady Harriet in

chain of diamonds, at the botttom of
