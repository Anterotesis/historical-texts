Arguments, but your Charity and our
Nece&s;&s;ity; of the former, you have given us
$word$ Proof$ as we acknowledge with all
Thankfulne&s;&s;. And of the latter, we have
too much, through the Misfortunes of the
Work. The Deceitfulne&s;s of the Ground fir&s;t
$span$ Bell-Founder lo&s;e his ca&s;t|ing
the hour bigge&s;t, to the Damage of 30 $.
and now his Error in over&s;izing the Eight
$word$, he hath ca&s;t&punc; &s;o far that they have &s;wal|lowed
up all the Metal for the Ten; and that
<PB N="99" REF="103">
requires 80 l. more to be added to our poor
Fund for the two other Bells, proportionable
to that Bigne&s;s. But yet an Error &s;o much
on the better Hand, that would make extream|ly
for the Advantage and Glory of the Ca|thedral
(the Bigne&s;s of &s;uch a Ring far more
be&s;itting the Place; and the&s;e Eight being
judged &s;o very good, that all are loth to have
them broken, and ca&s;t into le&s;s) if po&s;&s;ibly
that additional Sum could be rai&s;ed. To this
Purpo&s;e E&s;&abque; <HI>Diot,</HI> Mr. <HI>Walmi&s;ley,</HI> the Sub-Chantor,
and other Vicars, and Ringers are
mo&s;t indu&s;triou&s;ly undertaking a new Colle|ction,
and We and &s;everal others are willing
a-new to contribute, and if you will plea&s;e to
put to the helping Hand of your Piety and
Munificence; you will add &s;ignally to tho&s;e In|&s;tances
thereof already in our publick Cata|logue
of Benefactors, and will highly oblige
both tho&s;e zealous Undertakers, and e&s;pecially,</P>
