<OPENER><DATELINE>Hall'<HI>s</HI> Chocolate-Hou&s;e, <DATE>Augu&s;t the 18th. 1718.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_I Receiv'd Your's Dated the 3d. In&s;tant,
wherein you inform me of having
read in <HI>Applebee</HI>'s Weekly Journal an
Account of the Lo&s;s of Mr. KEENE
the late emin$nt Tragedian; and have
intimated, that you &s;hou'd be glad to
know &s;ome Pa&s;&s;ages in relation to his Life. Ac|cordingly
at Your Reque&s;t, I have Collected the fol|lowing
<PB N="ii" REF="3">
Narrative from the Hands of one of his
neare&s;t Relations, in order to oblige you, and the
Curious part of the World.</P>
<P>As to the Character of his private Life in relati|on
to his Morals, I &s;hall here take but very little
Notice, le&s;t whil&s;t in reality I &s;hou'd be giving
him his due Prai&s;es, I might be Cen&s;ured by tho&s;e
that were not intimately Acquainted with him to be
guilty of Flattery.</P>
<P>To proceed then to an Account of his Life. He
was Born of <HI>Di&s;&s;enting</HI> Parents, Educated at the
<HI>Presbyterian Academy</HI> in <HI>Little-Britain,</HI> and de&s;ign'd
by his Friends for a <HI>Di&s;&s;enting</HI> Teacher. He
acquired by his Studies a Knowledge of Men
and Books; the former of which was a di&s;creet
Guide to his Actions, and the latter an Ornament
to the natural Beauties of his Mind, which was no
&s;mall Advantage to him in his Profe&s;&s;ion. He cou'd
not have given a greater Proof of his Judgment
than by renouncing tho&s;e Errors in his Maturity,
which he had been train'd up in from his Youth;
and indeed he &s;how'd as great an in&s;tance of his
Hone&s;ty, when he cho&s;e, rather to quit a Fortune
among&s;t his Wealthy Relations, than to act con|trary
to the Sentiments of his Soul, or in plain
Terms, to di&s;&s;emble his Principles.</P>
<P>WHETHER Nece&s;&s;ity or Inclination led him
to the Stage, I cannot po&s;&s;ibly learn, but I believe
Both, for we may gue&s;s the Probability of the for|mer
from his being abandon'd by his Friends upon
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
Account of his Principles, and of the latter from
tho&s;e admirable Performances that &s;o often gain'd
him an univer&s;al Applau&s;e, and e&s;tabli&s;h'd him &s;o
great a Reputation in the Town. Where his fir&s;t
Appearance in his Profe&s;&s;ion was, I could never
hear; but it is certain, he Acted &s;everal Years in
the Countries as one of the Company that was
Govern'd by Mr. <HI>Coy&s;h,</HI> who was an eminent Actor
in the time of Mr. <HI>Hart,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Mohun:</HI> From
him we may believe he received his fir&s;t In&s;tru|ctions
in the Bu&s;ine&s;s, which his own Judgment
and con&s;tant Practice improv'd to &s;o great a Per|fection.
During this part of his Life, he married
one Mrs. <HI>Wilmot,</HI> a Per&s;on endow'd with uncom|mon
Qualifications; but to Sum up all, a tender
Wife, and a very &s;orrowful Widow. After ha|ving
left Mr. <HI>Coy&s;h</HI>'s Company, I am inform'd he
appeared upon the Stage in <HI>Dublin,</HI> from thence
he returned to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;oon got a Reputati|on
from his Performances here. The fir&s;t part in
which he &s;ignaliz'd him&s;elf to the Town, was
that of Ju&s;tice <HI>Ballance</HI> in the <HI>Recruiting Officer,</HI>
of which he was the Original.&mdash;When there was
no other Company of Comedians but his Maje&s;ty's,
he Acted at the Theatre Royal as one of tho&s;e,
and got a very great Reputation by the Parts of
<HI>Montezuma</HI> in the <HI>Indian Emperor, Creon</HI> in <HI>Oedipus,</HI>
Sir <HI>Edward Belfond</HI> in the Squire of <HI>Al&s;atia,</HI> Sir
<HI>Solomon Single, Jago</HI> in <HI>Othello, Aecius</HI> in <HI>Valentinian,
Henry</HI> the Fourth, and &s;everal Others. When Mr.
<HI>Rich</HI> Open'd his Hou&s;e in <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</HI> he
went over to that Company with &s;everal Others,
<PB N="iv" REF="5">
and appear'd &s;till to a greater Advantage; he
Acted the Parts of <HI>Hannibal, Dorax</HI> in <HI>Don Se|ba&s;tian,
Clitus</HI> in <HI>Alexander the Great, Diocle&s;ian,
Gerrard</HI> in the <HI>Beggar</HI>'s <HI>Bu&s;h,</HI> and Sir <HI>John Brute</HI>
in the <HI>Provok'd Wife</HI> with great Applau&s;e; how|ever
he was &s;ometimes, for want of principal Peo|ple,
forc'd to perform Parts out of his manner of
Playing; for as he carried the Stamp of Maje&s;ty
in his Pre&s;ence, and the &s;tern Roughne&s;s of
a Soldier in his Voice; the Softne&s;s of a Lover
cou'd not con&s;equently &s;it &s;o Natural upon him,
tho' indeed, his Performance even of tho&s;e Parts,
&s;poke that admirable Judgment which he was &s;o
much Ma&s;ter of.&mdash;In the beginning of the Year
1717, he joyn'd with Mr. <HI>Chri&s;topher Bullock,</HI> in
taking the Ma&s;ter-&s;hip of that Company for Four
Years from Mr. <HI>Rich,</HI> by an Agreement &s;ettled
between 'em.&mdash;This Crown'd the Reputation he
had before gain'd: In the mid&s;t of the fir&s;t Sea|&s;on
he had a very great Fit of Illne&s;s, of which
he afterwards Recovered: But before the begin|ning
of the Second, he had the fatal Misfortune
of a Fall from his Hor&s;e, by which, gaining a
mortal Hurt, he lay &s;ome few Days, and then expir'd
about the 38th. Year of his Age.&mdash;As a Proof
of his Genero&s;ity to People of Merit in Di&s;tre&s;s,
I can't but take Notice of an odd Accident that
happen'd &s;ince his Death. An Eminent Divine
that is now under &s;ome Afflictions, asking for
him at his Hou&s;e, (being ignorant of his Illne&s;s)
the Maid told him her Ma&s;ter was above Stairs,
he de&s;ired to &s;ee him; whereupon the Maid, without
informing him farther, Conducted the Gentleman to
<PB N="v" REF="6">
the Chamber where Mr. KEENE lay Dead, but
$t his Entrance he was &s;o &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee the
Corp&s;e of one he &s;o much lov'd, that he Swoon|ed,
and lay &s;ome time before he cou'd be brought
to him&s;elf; but upon his Recovery he bur&s;t in|to
Tears, and declared he had lo&s;t the only
Friend that had &s;uccour'd him amid&s;t his Mis|fortunes.</P>
<P>HIS Death being on a <HI>Saturday,</HI> on the <HI>Wed|ne&s;day</HI>
following he was carried from his Hou&s;e
in <HI>Cooks-Court</HI> by <HI>Lincolns-Inn-Fields,</HI> to be Interr'd
in the Pari&s;h Church of St. <HI>Clement Danes,</HI> the
Pall was held up by three Gentlemen from each
Theatre, <HI>viz.</HI> Mr. <HI>Booth,</HI> Mr. <HI>John&s;on,</HI> and Mr.
<HI>Mills</HI> from the Old Hou&s;e, and Mr. <HI>Bullock</HI> Sen.
Mr. <HI>Spiller,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Corey</HI> from the New: Mr.
<HI>Chri&s;topher Bullock</HI> appeared as Chief Mourner,
and the Corp&s;e was follow'd by the Actors of
each Theatre (mo&s;t of 'em in Black) in great De|cency.&mdash;Thus
they proceeded to the Church,
where there was a very fine Anthem perform'd;
afterwards he was Buried in a Vault, where lye
Mr. <HI>Mountford,</HI> Mr. <HI>Horden,</HI> and Mr. <HI>Powel,</HI> who
were all Eminent in the &s;ame Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, having fini&s;h'd my Relation, I now
recommend you to the peru&s;al of &s;ome Ver&s;es
here prefix'd, Written by different Hands upon this
Occa&s;ion, and I don't $ue&s;tion but the Subject
