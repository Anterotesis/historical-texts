<HEAD>A
SERIOUS INQUIRY
INTO THE
Unrea&s;onablene&s;s of a LAW
AGAINST
Occa&s;ional Conformity, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THe&s;e Sheets having been wrote during the late
Agitation between the two Hou&s;es, relating to
a Law again&s;t Occa&s;ional Conformity; upon
the demi&s;e of that Law, had been buried in
the Grave with it, had not the re&s;tle&s;s endeavours, both
of the Pre&s;s and the Pulpit been &s;et on foot to revive it.</P>
<P>The end of this Paper is not &s;o much in hopes to re|claim
a Party, who&s;e Malice is a con&s;tant Spurr to their
Heads, again&s;t Di&s;&s;enters; as to let the Ignorant, and
Well-meaning among them, if any &s;uch are to be found,
&s;ee a little what they are a doing.</P>
<P>As for the Di&s;&s;enters, tho' perhaps they have not
Power to prevent the Mi&s;chief, 'tis convenient to let the
World know, upon what Foot their Enemies Act; and
that tho' they may have the Misfortune to feel the Con|&s;equences,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
they may not pa&s;s for Fools too; but as their
Enemies trample upon the Honour and Character of
their Sovereign, they may let them &s;ee they know it.</P>
<P>A Worthy Author of a Penny &s;heet, &s;pread about
very indu&s;triou&s;ly, and Entitled, <HI>Rea&s;ons for this Law,</HI>
would prove it ought to Pa&s;s, becau&s;e of Her Maje&s;ty's
Promi&s;es of Maintaining the Church, and Encouraging
&s;uch as were mo&s;t Zealous for Her Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>This I take to be a de&s;ign of making Her Maje&s;ty's
Promi&s;es cla&s;h one again&s;t another, which they may
come off from, if they can.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, That the&s;e Gentlemen mi&s;took Her Maje|&s;ty's
Meaning, in the Promi&s;e &s;he made, of <HI>Encouraging
the mo&s;t Zealous Men of the Church of England;</HI> by &s;up|po&s;ing
Her Maje&s;ty meant thereby&punc; Such who&s;e Zeal
run highe&s;t again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters: Whereas Her Maje|&s;ty,
by declaring Her &s;elf &s;ince, the great Promoter of
Peace and Union among Her Subjects; and by Repeat|ing
to the Di&s;&s;enters Her Re&s;olution of Maintaining the
Toleration, has told them plainly what &s;he meant.</P>
<P>It looks a little &s;trange, That the Gentlemen, who
are &s;o hot for this Law, &s;hould think the Di&s;&s;enters &s;o
blind, as not to &s;ee the Toleration &s;truck at, in its mo&s;t
E&s;&s;ential Parts; and, as if they would hoodwink them
with the Vapour of the <HI>Aenigma,</HI> all the Pamphlets and
Sermons at the &s;ame time, that they would &s;tigmatize
Occa&s;ional Conformity, as the Badge of a Hypocrite;
joyn this &s;hadow for a Covering, <HI>Let them enjoy
their Toleration on God's Name,</HI> and <HI>No-body meddles with
Toleration,</HI> New A&s;&s;ociation. p.&mdash;. Now if the&s;e
Gentlemen will tell us, how a Law again&s;t Occa&s;ional
Conformity can be pa&s;s'd, and yet the Toleration Main|tain'd
entire, then I &s;hall give up the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>The be&s;t Argument that has been yet brought, to
prove the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of a Law again&s;t Occa&s;ional
<PB N="5" REF="4">
Conformity, is, <HI>That the Di&s;&s;enters have made u&s;e of it to
qualify them&s;elves for Publick Employments.</HI></P>
<P>That the Di&s;&s;enters think Occa&s;ional Communion
Lawful in it &s;elf, has been publickly declar'd, and
whether <HI>it be or not,</HI> does not &s;eem any part of the
Di&s;pute.</P>
<P>But the declar'd De&s;ign and Intention of tho&s;e who
Contend for an Occa&s;ional Bill, <HI>as we call it,</HI> is more Ef|fectually
to keep the Di&s;&s;enters out of Offices, and Pub|lick&punc;
Employments in the State.</P>
<P>Whether either of the&s;e be Lawful, whether a Di&s;|&s;enter
Occa&s;ionally may Conform to the Church of <HI>Eng|land;</HI>
Or whether it be ju&s;t, that a Di&s;&s;enter, as &s;uch,
ought to be Excluded from the Publick Tru&s;t, and made
uncapable of Serving the Government, tho' they are
great Points, and well worth Con&s;ideration, are yet no
part of the Que&s;tion in debate.</P>
<P>But whether it be rea&s;onable, that the Di&s;&s;enters <HI>&s;hou'd
either way be forc'd,</HI> be Excluded from Communion with
the Church, or with their Private Congregations, under
the Penalty of avoiding all Publick Employments, being
rendred uncapable to Serve the Government, and of the
Advantage of their Fellow <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> in the Service of
their Native Country; This is the Ca&s;e before us.</P>
<P>If any Man is to &s;cruple the Lawfulne&s;s of Conformi|ty
to the Church, it is the Di&s;&s;enter, and not the Church|man;
the Conformi&s;t cannot pretend 'tis Unlawful to
Conform, he would then become a Di&s;&s;enter him&s;elf.
But if the Di&s;&s;enter not Agreeing in all things, can yet
Conform in &s;ome, why &s;hould he be obliged, as by
&s;uch a Law he would be, either to Conform wholly, or
not Conform at all, and this under a &s;evere Penalty?</P>
<P>It may be an&s;wer'd, the Te&s;t was made to keep the
Whiggs out of Place, and they Defeat the end of that
Law, by taking the Sacrament; and 'tis ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
not to Tru&s;t them with Employments in
the Government, and therefore this Law is ab&s;olutely
Nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>This would be the Natural way of expre&s;&s;ing it, if
the High Churchmen would &s;peak their Minds hearti|ly;
and this may pa&s;s for a true Expo&s;ition of what
they have otherwi&s;e expre&s;s'd, and as it may ea&s;ily be
prov'd to be their end, &s;o it may ea&s;ily be prov'd.</P>
<Q><P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> That 'tis an Uunju&s;t De&s;ign.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> That 'tis an Unrea&s;onable Method.</P></Q>
<P>I. 'Tis an Unju&s;t De&s;ign to deprive the Di&s;&s;enters of
Publick Employments, and Unqualify them for the Ser|vice
of their Country, without any Offence Committed.
The Law Suppo&s;es every Man a good Man, till &s;ome|thing
appears to the contrary; now Di&s;&s;enting from the
Communion of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> is <HI>no Offence a|gain&s;t
the Law,</HI> but is, by a &s;pecial Law, <HI>Permitted and
made Legal;</HI> no Man therefore can ju&s;tly be made Un|capable
of the Service of his Country, till he is found
Guilty of the Breach of &s;ome Law.</P>
<P>II. No Law can Ju&s;tly be made to deprive a Man of
any Right, for an Action which is not unlawful, either
in it &s;elf or Circum&s;tances. <HI>Laws made again&s;t Right</HI>
and <HI>Ju&s;tice</HI> are Unju&s;t Laws, Oppre&s;&s;ions and Tyrannies
upon the People; and tho' we mu&s;t &s;ubmit when they
are made, becau&s;e they are made by a Lawful Autho|rity,
yet they are not the more Ju&s;t in their own Na|ture.</P>
<P>'Tis
therefore an Unju&s;t De&s;ign to deprive us of our
Birth-right, as <HI>Engli&s;hmen,</HI> for our Di&s;agreement in Mat|ters
of Religion; e&s;pecially while this Di&s;agreement is
Legal, and made &s;o by an Act of Parliament.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
But after all, if it were to be Granted, which yet no
Wi&s;e Man will Grant, that it is ab&s;olutely Nece&s;&s;ary to
the Safety of the Government to keep the Di&s;&s;enters
out of Places, a thing no Man could ever prove&mdash;yet
<HI>the Method,</HI> which is Profe&s;s'd by tho&s;e Gentlemen,
who are of that Opinion, is very Unrea&s;onable and Un|ju&s;t;
and <HI>this is the Argument I have undertaken to make
good.</HI></P>
<P>I have no De&s;ign hereby, to &s;ay any thing relating to
the Bill lately depending in the Hou&s;e; or to the De|bates
between the Two Hou&s;es on that Head; nor &s;hall I
Concern them in this Di&s;cour&s;e any farther, than to
Quote Matter of Fact from them; which I hope may
be done without Offence.</P>
<P>But I have numberle&s;s Authors to bring upon the
Stage, to prove the thing I alledge, of which this is the
Ab&s;tract.</P>
<P>That the High Churchmen have, and for many Years
have had, a De&s;ign, if po&s;&s;ible, to procure an Act of Par|liament,
to prevent the Di&s;&s;enters from Holding, Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing,
or Enjoying Places, Offices, or Employments in the Go|vernment,
by obliging them to a Strict, Total, and Ab|&s;olute
Conformity to the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now tho' Occa&s;ional Communion is not hereby
Condemn'd or Defended; yet 'tis plain, that a Law to
Oblige the Di&s;&s;enters to a Total Conformity, or el&s;e to
&s;uffer &s;uch and &s;uch Penalties, is Unju&s;t and Unrea&s;o|nable
in its own Nature.</P>
<P>1. All <HI>Force upon the Con&s;cience is &V;nchri&s;tian and &V;n|rea&s;onable;</HI>
to Compell any one to Act again&s;t their Con|&s;ciences,
is Unrea&s;onable and Unju&s;t; becau&s;e the Scri|pture
fays 'tis mo&s;t rea&s;onable <HI>to obey God rather than
Man;</HI> I think 'tis a Matter &s;o long ago decided, even
by the Church of <HI>England</HI> it &s;elf, <HI>That thc Laws of Man
have no Sovereignty over the Con&s;cience,</HI> that it would be
<PB N="8" REF="7">
a needle&s;s Vanity in me, to mention any thing of it;
and the Martyrs in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>'s Reign, are my Pre|cedents
to back the Argument.</P>
<P>If then 'tis Unlawful to Compell me again&s;t my Con|&s;cience
to Comply, 'tis Unlawful to Puni&s;h me for
not Complying; for it cannot be Lawful to Puni&s;h me,
for refu&s;ing what you have no Power to Command
me to do.</P>
<P>The Act of Parliament which oblig'd the Di&s;&s;enters
to qualify them&s;elves, by taking the Sacrament, mu&s;t
imply, that it was Lawful for them to take it, or el&s;e
it had been an Unlawful Act in its own Nature; for a
Law Commanding a Sin, is a Contradiction in its &s;elf,
and no Law, but a Libel: but &s;ay &s;ome, when we made
this Act, 'twas believ'd the Di&s;&s;enters would not have
complied with it, and &s;o have been kept out.</P>
<P>Very good; So that 'twas a Trick put upon them,
pre&s;uming upon their &s;crupulous Con&s;ciences; this may
be true, but 'twas never the hone&s;ter in the De&s;ign; and
this is the occa&s;ion of the New Method now in hand,
and is a farther Proof of the Matter alledg'd, that 'tis
not Conformity, or Non-Conformity; 'tis not Con&s;tant
or Occa&s;ional Conformity is the Que&s;tion, but the keep|ing
the Di&s;&s;enters out of Offices, <HI>that they may get in:</HI>
'Tis Supplanting their Neighbours, and Incapacitating
their Brethren; This is the Matter in hand.</P>
<P>Total Conformity then being a Sin, in the Opinion
of a Di&s;&s;enter, to Compell him to it, is forcing him to
Sin, which is directly again&s;t the Scripture.</P>
<P>But, &s;ays the Objector, This is not Compelling them,
for they may let Places and Preferments alone, and then
they may let Conformity alone, and Welcome.</P>
<P>This is a Chri&s;tianlike Argument indeed, and makes
it plain, that 'tis neither the Advantage of the Church,
which is &s;ought, nor the Good of the Di&s;&s;enter; not
<PB N="9" REF="8">
the Advantage of the Church, by bringing over Pro&s;e|lytes
to her Communion; nor the Good of the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
by bringing them off from their Mi&s;takes; but 'tis
the Profits, the Honours, the Employments in the State,
which are the things;
<Q><L>And all the Strife is plainly to be &s;een,</L>
<L>To get &s;ome Men put out, and &s;ome put in.</L></Q>
And this is the handle to the &s;econd Head.</P>
<P>II. <HI>Yhat 'tis downright Per&s;ecution.</HI> To Puni&s;h on Ac|count
of Con&s;cience, is Per&s;ecution in the mo&s;t Inten&s;e
degree.</P>
<P>Shall they tell us we are not Compell'd to Conform;
and that here is no force put on the Con&s;cience, but
Puni&s;h us if we do not? Incapacitate us for the Service
of our Queen and Country; &s;hut us out from a &s;hare in
the Favours of our Prince, and in the Rights and Pri|vileges
of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men? This is Puni&s;hment for Non|conformity;
Puni&s;hment for Con&s;cience &s;ake, is Per&s;cu|tion
for Con&s;cience &s;ake; and it is allow'd without Con|tradiction,
by all the Prote&s;tant Churches in <HI>Europe,</HI> that
Per&s;ecution for Con&s;cience &s;ake, is Unchri&s;tian, and con|&s;equently
Unrea&s;onable and Unju&s;t.</P>
<P>The <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI> which is from <HI>on high,</HI> in &s;ome Tran&s;la|tions
call'd the <HI>Spirit</HI> of <HI>God,</HI> is de&s;cribed in Scripture
to be fir&s;t, <HI>Pure,</HI> then <HI>Peaceable, Gentle,</HI> and <HI>ea&s;y</HI> to be
<HI>entreated;</HI> by the Spirit of God here, Commentators
agree, is meant, not the Holy Gho&s;t, frequently in Scri|pture,
call'd the Spirit of God, or God the Spirit; But
the Chri&s;tian Temper, wrought by the Spirit of God;
and if this Temper be of the Spirit, a Temper of Cruel|ty,
Force and Per&s;ecution, mu&s;t not be of the &s;ame Spi|rit,
and con&s;equently Unju&s;t and Unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="9">
<HI>III.</HI> This is an Infraction upon the Act of Toleration, and
therefore an &V;nrea&s;onable Law; that Act being founded up|on
the highe&s;t Rea&s;on in the World.</P>
<P>The Rea&s;onablene&s;s of the Act of Toleration, is found|ed
upon two Principal Articles.</P>
<P>1. Its being every Man's Native Right to enjoy the
Benefit and Liberty of Serving God, his Maker, in that
Way or Method, which in his Con&s;cience he believes
to be mo&s;t agreeable to his reveal'd Will, and which
he al&s;o finds to be mo&s;t Beneficial to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>It has been a Controverted Point, whether it be
Lawful to Compel any Man to be a Chri&s;tian, or to
&s;erve God at all; I think 'tis needle&s;s to be concern'd
in this Di&s;pute; for he who &s;uffers, becau&s;e he will
have no Religion at all, cannot be Per&s;ecuted for his
Religion, but his Athei&s;m and Irreligion.</P>
<P>But that in Matters relating to the manner of Wor|&s;hip,
and the different ways of &s;erving the &s;ame God;
St. <HI>Peter</HI> has left a Memorable, and mo&s;t Deci&s;ive Pre|cedent
in <HI>Acts</HI> 5. 29. when they Charg'd them, that
they &s;hould Preach no more in that Name, that was,
the Name of Chri&s;t; they &s;o much the more Proclaim'd
the Go&s;pel in all the Parts of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P><HI>'Tis remarkable in this Place, who it was Charged
them; 'twas the Elders, the High Prie&s;ts, and the Rulers
of the</HI> Jews; <HI>the Great</HI> Sanhedrim: <HI>'Twas a Vote of their
Parliament, and their An&s;wer was in &s;hort,</HI> &startq;'Tis a &s;hame
you &s;hould pretend to Countermand what God has Com|manded;
no Human Power can pretend to be Obey'd in
&s;uch a Ca&s;e: We de&s;ire you to put it to the Vote in
plain words, whet her we &s;hall Obey God or You.&endq;</P>
<P>On this Account the Act of Toleration is founded upon
the mo&s;t Rea&s;onable Con&s;ideration in the World; 'tis a
Conce&s;&s;ion of Natural Right; 'tis an Acknowledgement
<PB N="11" REF="10">
that we ought to Obey the Dictates of Con&s;cience, ra|ther
than an Act of Parliament; 'tis a Law made, that
we may Obey God rather than Man, as it was our Na|tive
as well as Chri&s;tian Right to do before; 'tis in &s;hort
only an Act of Ju&s;tice, not an Act of Grace; 'tis an Act,
by which the Church of <HI>England</HI> is clear'd from being
of a per&s;ecuting Spirit, which they were but too Guilty
of before.</P>
<P>2. The Rea&s;onablene&s;s of this Act of Toleration
appears, as it is a Purcha&s;e of the Di&s;&s;enters, and con|&s;equently
their own, their due; 'tis a debt to the Ca|pitulations,
made in the Name of the whole People of
<HI>England,</HI> with the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> which has been
&s;ufficiently prov'd in another Place.</P>
<P>The Act of Toleration being then an Act of the high|e&s;t
Ju&s;tice to the Di&s;&s;enters, and built on Foundations
of <HI>Rea&s;on and Right;</HI> any Sub&s;equent Law made in Pre|judice
of the Liberty, Granted by the Toleration, is high|ly
Unju&s;t and Unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>It remains to this Head, That a Law again&s;t Occa&s;i|onal
Conformity, be prov'd to be an Infraction of the
Toleration.</P>
<P>The Act of Toleration is a Liberty given by Act of
Parliament, That all &s;uch, who&s;e Con&s;ciences will not
permit them to Conform to the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
may Wor&s;hip God, according to their &s;everal Judg|ments
and Opinions, without Di&s;turbance, and Exem|pting
them from all Penalties and Puni&s;hments for the
&s;ame; for which we refer them to the Act it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Now as there are &s;everal kinds of Di&s;&s;enters, as well
as &s;everal &s;orts of Conformi&s;ts, &s;ome Di&s;&s;ent entirely
from the Church, and own neither her Doctrine nor
Wor&s;hip; &s;ome can Conform to &s;omething, &s;ome to
none at all; it &s;eems a Contradiction to Rea&s;on, and
<PB N="12" REF="11">
reflects upon the Church-Mens Uunder&s;tanding, as
well as Hone&s;ty, that they &s;hould make the Law to
Puni&s;h tho&s;e who can Conform in part, and let tho&s;e a|lone
who will not Conform at all; this is far from a
Chri&s;tian Endeavour, to bring the Di&s;&s;enters home,
into the Bo&s;om of the Church, and Unite the Flock
under one Shepherd; for it Encourages tho&s;e who are
the farthe&s;t off, to continue where they are, and tho&s;e
who are neare&s;t, and in part brought in, and by Oc|ca&s;ional
Complying, are in a fair way to a total Con|formity,
<HI>if not in them&s;elves, in their Po&s;terity without
fail;</HI> the&s;e are to be puni&s;h'd for what they do, and
either compelled to Conform farther than they can&mdash;Commanded
not to Conform at all, or Puni&s;h'd for
the middle way, their own Inclinations Dictate to them.</P>
<P>'Tis mo&s;t Certain, the Nature of the thing, even
the meaning of the Word Toleration, <HI>viz. a Permi&s;&s;ion
for &s;uch as cannot Conform,</HI> Implies all &s;orts of Di&s;&s;ent|ing;
and if any are to be thought Excluded in the
Meaning of the Act, it mu&s;t be &s;uch as are wide&s;t in
their Scruples, and at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from Con|formity,
not &s;uch as Di&s;&s;ent but in a few &s;mall mat|ters,
and can Conform in the main Points.</P>
<P>But this Law is prepared to Puni&s;h &s;uch as can Con|form
in Part, and Encourage them and all others to a
farther and a total Non-Conformity; and is therefore ex|pre&s;ly
contrary to the Intent and Meaning of the
Act of Toleration, and in its &s;elf ab&s;urd and unrea|&s;onable.</P>
<P>As the Act of Toleration is an Exempting the Di&s;&s;en|ters
from all Penalties and Puni&s;hments for Di&s;&s;enting,
this lays a Forfeiture or Penalty on their Di&s;&s;enting
again; and I know not for my Life, what to call that,
but a Repealing Part of the Toleration. I wi&s;h &s;ome
wi&s;er Body, would find me out another Name for it.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="12">
IV. <HI>'Tis again&s;t the general Right of Chri&s;tians;</HI>
for as the Sovereignty of Con&s;cience has been &s;uffi|ciently
Afferted, and even the very Act of Toleration
acknowleges it to be Superior to Law, Independent of all
Human Power, and ought not to be either forc'd or
re&s;trained, &s;o it can no more be ju&s;t, to compel me
not to Conform in part, than it can be to oblige me
to a total Conformity.</P>
<P>I call that Compelling, Forcing, and the like, which
however plau&s;ible, the pretence of leaving it in my
Choice, may be, makes a Depriving me of any thing
which I Enjoy'd before, and had a Right to Enjoy,
the penalty of my pur&s;uing the Dictates of my Con|&s;cience:
This is forcing me, as far as it is in the Pow|er
of any Man to force another, for no Man can force
another any farther than by Inflicting a Puni&s;hment
for not Complying; The Law does not force a Man
not to Murther his Neighbour, only tells him he &s;hall
be Hang'd if he does: If I am obliged totally to Con|form,
or totally to Di&s;&s;ent, when my Con&s;cience di|rects
me to Di&s;&s;ent in &s;ome things, and <HI>to Conform in
all things I can,</HI> this is as much Impo&s;ing upon my
Con&s;cience, as Compelling me to a total Conformity
would be; this is Force, and Force is Per&s;ecution, and
both are Unju&s;t and Unrea&s;onable.</P>
<P>V. <HI>'Tis again&s;t her Maje&s;ties Gracious Promi&s;es of
continuing the Toleration to the Di&s;&s;enters.</HI> The Royal
Veracity of the Queen, more than once Repeated on
this Head, is a Satisfaction to the Di&s;&s;enters, that they
&s;hall Enjoy the full Benefit of the Act of Toleration;
her Maje&s;ty in her late Speeches to the Parliament, has
redoubl'd her A&s;&s;urances on this Head, and it &s;eems to
me, that the Safety of the Di&s;&s;enters has a greater
<PB N="14" REF="13">
Dependance upon this Head, than upon the Act of
Toleration it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Acts of Parliament depend upon the Opinons of dif|ferent
Men, who&s;e Breath, like them&s;elves, is Frail
and Uncertain; they are frequently chang'd, and fre|quently
change their Opinions; one Hou&s;e often Re|peals
what a former Hou&s;e Enacts, they very often al|ter
and di&s;&s;anull what they have Enacted them&s;elves;
but if forty Hou&s;es attempt to alter or di&s;&s;anull the
Toleration, &s;o as to deprive the Di&s;&s;enters of the Be|nefit

&s;uch a Law; for &s;he has given us her Royal Pro|mi&s;e,
that &s;he will continue her Protection of the Di&s;|&s;enters
in their Enjoyment of the Toleration E&s;ta|bli&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Now for any People to de&s;ire to deprive the Di&s;&s;ent|ers
of their Liberty of Con&s;cience, to deprive them
of the Benefit of the Toleration, or of any part of
it, is it not to de&s;ire the Queen to break her Word?
is it not to de&s;ire Her Maje&s;ty to le&s;&s;en the Liberty
given us before? and I wonder tho&s;e Gentlemen who
are &s;o Violent for &s;uch a thing, do not &s;ee, or at lea&s;t
Con&s;ider what it is they are driving at.</P>
<P>Can they think that her Maje&s;ty can weaken or
limit the Toleration, and not &s;ee that 'tis an A&s;&s;aul$
upon the Honour of her Parole; has She not told
them that they &s;hall always find her have a Sacred
Regard to her Promi&s;es? have they not &s;een <HI>her Ma|je&s;ty
Profe&s;s a Spotle&s;s Veracity?</HI> can they find her Injur|ing
her own Honour, or her Subjects Confidence in this
ca&s;e? and why &s;hould they Imagin <HI>&s;o Vilely</HI> of their
Sovereign? does it not &s;eem a want of Manners, as well
as a want of their Confidence in the Queen?</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="14">
It is Objected, but this is not an Act again&s;t the
Toleration, but only Explanatory, to tell the World
what was, and was not meant by it; and it has always
been granted that the Hou&s;e of Commons are the
proper Expo&s;itors of Law.</P>
<P>In Doubtful Ca&s;es, 'ts true the Hou&s;e are the Explain|ers
of their own Meaning, but <HI>Toleration is an Ex|plicit
Term,</HI> wants no Explication of its Meaning, and
the Conditions of it are exactly Expre&s;s'd in the Act of
Parliament, its Extent is limited to Prote&s;tant Di&s;&s;en|tors,
only to &s;uch and to all &s;uch.</P>
<P>Now the De&s;ign I am upon, is not an Expo&s;ition, but
a Limitation; and to Limit the Extent of the Tolera|tion,
is to Repeal part of the Law; and con&s;equently
to Intrench upon her Maje&s;ties Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>The Queen has not given her Word to the Di&s;&s;en|ters,
to pre&s;erve part of the Toleration, <HI>but the Tole|ration,</HI>
which mu&s;t be under&s;tood of the whole, or
el&s;e by the &s;ame Rule they may obtain the Repeal of
all or any the Enacting Clau&s;es in the Bill, and yet
pretend the Promi&s;es of the Queen remain untouch'd.</P>
<P>This would be making her Maje&s;ty Equivocate
with her Subjects, which is below her Thoughts; and
as &s;he has told us, we &s;hall always find her a Re|ligious
Ob&s;erver of her Word; I cannot Imagin
her Maje&s;ty can ever a&s;&s;ent to Limit the Tolerati|on
without offering a horrid Affront to the Honour
of her Maje&s;ties Word, and making her a Deluder of
her Subjects.</P>
<P>Some People have taken upon them to State the
Matter of the Queen's Promi&s;e, and to Di&s;tingui&s;h
Nicely between an Act of her Maje&s;ties Will, and a
Conce&s;&s;ion to an Act of Parliament; and tell us from
this Head, that her Maje&s;ty will not fail to be as
good as her Word, as far as Concerns her &s;elf, but that
<PB N="16" REF="15">
if it be done by an Act of Parliament, that is a gene|ral
thing, is the Act and Deed of the People of <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
that 'tis their own doing, not hers; even the
Di&s;&s;enters them&s;elves do it, for they are properly &s;aid
to Act in their Repre&s;entatives. Now tho' the Queen
did promi&s;e to maintain the Toleration, yet &s;he did
not Promi&s;e to do it again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters Will, and
if they come and ask her to do it, &s;he is by that
Reque&s;t ab&s;olv'd from her Promi&s;e, and free to Grant
what they De&s;ire.</P>
<P>This is a way, by which any Body may di&s;tingui&s;h
them&s;elves out of their Promi&s;es, but an Hone&s;t An|&s;wer
puts an End to it.</P>
<P>The Queen's Promi&s;e is not Negative, that &s;he will
<HI>not take away</HI> the Toleration, but it is po&s;itive, that <HI>&s;he
will pre&s;erve it,</HI> and Protect the Di&s;&s;enters in the En|joyment
of their Liberty.</P>
<P>As to <HI>the Parliament De&s;iring</HI> it to be taken away,
which is as if the Di&s;&s;enters did it, their Repre&s;en|tatives
being in Parliament; I An&s;wer, this is a Sophi&s;m
in Argument; 'tis true the Di&s;&s;enters are Repre&s;ented
in Parliament, as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men&punc; But not as Di&s;&s;enters;
and therefore the Ca&s;e differs, had the Di&s;&s;enters Cho&s;en
a Repre&s;entative of them&s;elves, as Di&s;&s;enters, and the&s;e
in the Name of the re&s;t, had come and told her Ma|je&s;ty,
they de&s;ired the Toleration &s;hould be Repealed;
I Grant in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, her Maje&s;ty was clear of her
Promi&s;e; but for a Parliament, they Repre&s;ent the Di&s;|&s;enters
in their Civil, but not in their Religious Ca|pacity;
this Promi&s;e is made to them as Di&s;&s;enters;
<HI>as &s;uch,</HI> they are no where Repre&s;ented, and therefore
cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed to Act in a Repeal of &s;uch a Law,
nor can the Actions of any Hou&s;e Di&s;engage her Ma|je&s;ty
from her Promi&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="17" REF="16">
For if, a Subject may not Interpret the Queen's Pro|mi&s;e,

<P>I hope this Explication can be no Detriment to the
Honour or Veracity of the Queen; &s;ince no Body can
have the Impudence to &s;ay, &s;he has yet done any
thing to Infringe this Sacred A&s;&s;urance; nor can any
of her People, without having &s;candalous Thoughts
of their Sovereign, Imagin &s;he will break her Word.</P>
<P>How then, can our Church of <HI>England</HI> Brethren,
look her Maje&s;ty in the Face, when they are every
Day expo&s;ing the Toleration, as a thing not fit to
be Continued?</P>
<P>The telling us, &startq;That this is Complimenting the

<P>To make a &s;hort Comment on this worthy Text.</P>
<P>Every Man, or <HI>every one,</HI> for the Queen is a Ma&s;cu|line
in her Politick Capacity, every one that wi&s;hes the
Churches Welfare, Ought, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Mark,</P>
<P>From hence I draw this Argument.</P>
<P>The Queen has not Hung out the Bloody Flag of
Defyance; what then, one of the&s;e two things follows.</P>
<P>I. Either the Queen does not do as &s;he Ought to do;</P>
<P>II. Or the Queen does not Wi&s;h the Welfare of the
Church.</P>
<P>If any Man can make another, or more proper
Inference from the Words, he is welcome to do it;
for my Part I acknowlege I cannot.</P>
<P>If this be the Opinion, this Worthy Gentleman has
of her Maje&s;ties Conduct; If the Vice C&mdash;r of <HI>Ox|ford</HI>
thinks to Licen&s;e &s;uch Language as this to be
Printed on the Queen; Never let the Pillory be E|rected
for an Author, for Affronting her Maje&s;ty a|gain.
If this be not the <HI>Shorte&s;t Way;</HI> If this be not
a Method by it &s;elf; If ever Queen was thus Bantred
before; Let them tell us the Time.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty has Promi&s;ed to Protect the Di&s;&s;enters,
continue the Toleration, and bids them not be appre|hen&s;ive
of any Danger; but here comes Mr. <HI>S&mdash;ll</HI>
with a Voucher from a whole Univer&s;ity, and &s;ays, that if
her Maje&s;ty wi&s;hes well to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> She
mu&s;t not Tolerate them, but hang out the Bloody
Flag and Banner of Defyance again&s;t them; that is, the
Queen, if She wi&s;hes well to the Church of <HI>England,</HI>
mu&s;t break her Promi&s;e with the Di&s;&s;enters, and Con|&s;ent
to Demoli&s;h the Toleration-Act; Deprive them
<PB N="19" REF="18">
of their Liberty, and Proceed again&s;t them <HI>the Shorte&s;t
Way.</HI></P>
<P>In &s;hort, according to the be&s;t Judgment I can
make of this matter, This way of Treating the Di&s;|&s;enters,
is the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Abu&s;e upon the Queen, as can
po&s;&s;ibly be put upon her; and they mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e her
Maje&s;ty to be &s;omething, that I have more Manners
than to mention, if She does not take &s;ome more than
ordinary Notice of it&mdash;.</P>
<P>I think, I may Challenge them all to &s;hew one
In&s;tance, when ever the Di&s;&s;enters, <HI>tho&s;e Spawn of
Rebels, and Vermin not fit to Live,</HI> as the Worthy
Dr. <HI>H&mdash;h</HI> calls them; when ever they offered any &s;uch
Affront to her Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>But the&s;e Gentlemen, pre&s;uming upon her Goodne&s;s,
at the &s;ame time abu&s;e either her Under&s;tanding, or
her Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Either they abu&s;e her Under&s;tanding; as if her Ma|je&s;ty
could not &s;ee when &s;he was Bantred; or they Im|po&s;e
upon her Ju&s;tice, as if her Maje&s;ty would allow
the &s;ame In&s;olence in a Church Clergy Man, which
in another Man &s;hall be Puni&s;ht with the Pillory.</P>
<P>To Sum up all, It &s;eems clear to me, that her Ma|je&s;ty
can pa&s;s no Law, that &s;hall le&s;&s;en the Di&s;&s;enters
Liberty of Conforming, or not Conforming, as they
now Enjoy it, by Vertue of the late Act of Parliament,
without Intrenching upon her Royal Promi&s;e, more
than once made to the Di&s;&s;enters, without le&s;&s;ening the
Opinion the World has entertained of her Royal Word,
and the Hone&s;ty of her Maintaining it.</P>
<P>And whereas Duty as well as Charity, obliges us
to believe, that her Maje&s;ty will not fail to Maintain
that Religious, Regard which &s;he has told us &s;he will
have to her Word, we may at the &s;ame time con|clude,
'tis Impo&s;&s;ible &s;he &s;hould ever be brought to
<PB N="20" REF="19">
Pa&s;s a Law, that in the lea&s;t offers to Infringe, or
Intrench upon that Sacred Promi&s;e, &s;he has made the
Di&s;&s;enters, of Maintaining the Toleration.</P>
<P>'Tis Impo&s;&s;ible her Maje&s;ty can A&s;&s;ent to any Act,
which &s;hall le&s;&s;en the Liberty given the Di&s;&s;enters, by
the Act of Toleration; 'tis Impo&s;&s;ible She can agree
to Limit the Term of that Act, for that would be to
Repeal part of the Act, and con&s;equently break her
Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>However, &s;ince 'tis plain there is a Party in the Church,
who are &s;o eager to pull down the Di&s;&s;enters, who are
for <HI>Bloody Flags, and Banners of Defyance again&s;t them,</HI>
who have Beat <HI>Hudibras</HI>'s Eccle&s;ia&s;tick Drum, to Rai&s;e
the Mob again&s;t them, and who are willing to Mortgage
the Hone&s;ty of their Sovereign.</P>
<P>If I might be allow'd to give advice to the Di&s;&s;enters,
it &s;hould be to throw them&s;elves at her Maje&s;ties Royal
Feet, and Humbly ask her Protection, in Terms like the&s;e.</P>

Nor can the Di&s;&s;enters be blam'd for taking her

<P>VI. I come now to Argue, that this way of limit|ing
of Toleration, by a Law to prevent Occa&s;ional
Conformity, <HI>is again&s;t the Intere&s;t of the Church of</HI> Eng|land.</P>
<P>'Tis
certainly the Intere&s;t of the Church, as a Church,
to bring back all her Children into her own Bo&s;om,
that we &s;hould have all one Di&s;cipline, as well as
Doctrine; one Mode of Wor&s;hip, as we have one Ob|ject
of Wor&s;hip; and therefore all Laws which tend
to drive People farther from the Communion of the
Church, are again&s;t her Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>They who are for E&s;tabli&s;hing the Church, by keep|ing
all the Di&s;&s;enters out of her Communion, are cer|tainly
the mo&s;t Impolitick People in the World; for</P>
<P>The Strength and Glory of a Church, as of a Go|vernment,
is the Number of its Subjects, Pro&s;elytes and
Converts; and to make a Law that &s;hall &s;hut out of
her Protection, &s;uch as are Conforming to them, is
the mo&s;t Impolitick thing in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
1. <HI>'Tis contrary to the General Practice of all Churches
in the World;</HI> All are for bringing over People to con|form
to their Way of Wor&s;hip; if they cannot conform
wholly, they are willing to have them conform as far as
they can, in hopes to bring them up to higher degrees
and at la&s;t to compleat Conformity.</P>
<P>Some Churches have u&s;ed Violence, to bring People
to conform to their Way of Wor&s;hip, and per&s;ecuted
them for not do$ng it; and where they could not force
a thorow Compliance, have accepted a Compliance for
a time, or in part; but the Church of <HI>England</HI> is the
only Church in the World that puni&s;h'd any becau&s;e
they would not wholly conform, by a Forcing them
not to conform at all.</P>
<P>2. <HI>'Tis contrary to Humane Policy;</HI> for in all probability
the Po&s;terity of tho&s;e People, who now conform in
part, will be total Conformi&s;ts; and to promote a &s;trict
total Di&s;&s;ent, by rejecting a partial Conformity, is to
&s;hut out the Po&s;terity of tho&s;e who are &s;hut out now,
and con&s;equently le&s;&s;en all pro&s;pect of a General Union,
by fixing the <HI>Di&s;&s;ent</HI> of tho&s;e who would conform, and
thereby &s;trengthen the Party, by Encrea&s;ing their
Numbers.</P>
<P>It has been in&s;inuated by &s;ome, that the pre&s;ent Lea|ding
Party in the Church, do not de&s;ire the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI>
&s;hould conform, becau&s;e they would &s;trengthen the
<HI>Low-Church Party,</HI> and promote <HI>Moderation</HI> in the
Church. This is a Helli&s;h Notion; 'tis a piece of In|fernal
Polity; &s;avours of the Spirit which reigns in that
dark Region, and &s;ubjects the Work of the Mini&s;try to
a Scandal of <HI>State-Trick Priest-Craft,</HI> and all that's Vil|lainous
and Ba&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
As if any Chri&s;tian Mini&s;ter of the Church of <HI>England</HI>
could be &s;o vile, to wi&s;h the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> not to be United
if po&s;&s;ible to the Church, to wi&s;h the Number of Or|thodox
Catholick Chri&s;tians not to encrea&s;e, or the
Peace and Union of the&s;e Nations in matters of Reli|gion,
not to be brought to pa&s;s, and all upon a de&s;ign
of State-policy.</P>
<P>And yet this certainly &s;eems to be True, &s;ince the&s;e
Gentlemen pu&s;h at a Law to bring them to a total
Conformity, or exclude them from any Conformity at
all.</P>
<P>For &s;till I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that dive&s;ting them of Pla|ces,
unle&s;s they do totally conform, is forcing them to
a total Di&s;&s;ent, as far as Force is in the power of the
Parties we mean.</P>
<P>To this ble&s;&s;ed Pa&s;s is Religion brought; <HI>when Prie&s;ts
turn States-Men, 'tis always thus;</HI> the Policy of the&s;e
Gentlemen prevails over their Con&s;ciences, and they
are Now &s;ettling their Intere&s;t in the Government, at
the Expence of their Religion; in &s;hort, they are Li&s;ted
in a Religious Plot, and are a Party-making, not a
Chri&s;tian-making. The Cure of Souls mu&s;t give way
to the &s;ettling an Intere&s;t, and they &s;u&s;pend the Clergy-Men
to put on the States-Men; 'tis not the Di&s;&s;enter
they would Covert, but 'tis the Whig they would Con|vert;
If the Occa&s;ional Conformi&s;t would leave off
his Party in Politicks, they would Embrace him, they
could ea&s;ily bear with his Conformity; but they cannot
bear with his being a Whig: Thus Religion is made the
Pimp of a Party; and the Sacred In&s;titutions of Chri&s;t
Je&s;us, are Pro&s;tituted to &s;erve for Marks of Di&s;tinction,
between Factions in the State.</P>
<P>If this be not the Ca&s;e, 'tis Impo&s;&s;ible for any Man
to a&s;&s;ign me a Rea&s;on, why the Church of <HI>England</HI>
&s;hould not de&s;ire to bring all the Di&s;&s;enters in to her Com|munion,
<PB N="24" REF="23">
and, as far as in her lies, to Encourage them to
come in.</P>
<P>It can never be An&s;wer'd, why they &s;hould not ac|cept
of &s;ome as well as of all and Encourage Confor|mity
in all the Particulars; &s;ince they who can Con|form
in part, may in time be brought to Conform in
the whole.</P>
<P>He that de&s;ires a Reformation, de&s;ires all the degrees
of Reformation; and it cannot con&s;i&s;t with a true de|&s;ire
to bring over the Di&s;&s;enters to the Church, not to
Encourage tho&s;e who are in part brought over; &s;ince
if they had any Regard to Po&s;terity, 'tis more than
probable, the Occa&s;ional Conformity of the pre&s;ent Di&s;|&s;enters,
is a great &s;tep towards Reconciling their Po&s;te|rity
Ab&s;olutely.</P>
<P>The&s;e Arguments would certainly be moving, were
not the whole a State Trick, a Machine of Govern|ment,
to prevent a Union between the Low Church-Men
and the Di&s;&s;enters, which the other Party Indu|&s;triou&s;ly
avoid, le&s;t &s;uch a Conjunction &s;hould prove
fatal to them, and they &s;hould by that means be out

is perfected, <HI>and the Bloody Flag Hung out,</HI> what ought
the Di&s;&s;enters to expect?</P>
<P>Will they tell us, this may be done, and our Tole|ration
not injur'd? Are we to &s;it &s;till under it all, and
own this is no Per&s;ecution? Are we to care&s;s the
Church, and &s;ay, Peace, Peace, are we to own they go
on with the Queen's <HI>Peace and &V;nion?</HI></P>
<P>Are we under all this to &s;ay, That the Lenity and
Mercy of the Church is con&s;picuous, in granting us Leave
to go to our Meetings and &s;erve God our own Way; and
grant, that Suffering the Lo&s;s of Civil Rites to obtain or
to maintain this, is no Suffering for Religion, nor in the
Impo&s;er is no Oppre&s;&s;ion?</P>
<P>When we are thus pa&s;&s;ive, it mu&s;t be own'd they do
us no Wrong, who tell us, we are of the Tribe of <HI>I&s;&s;a|char,</HI>
and give us for our Coat of Arms, an A&s;s Cou|chant
under a Church Rampant.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters may indeed have the Misfortune to be
oppre&s;s'd, and oblig'd to bear the&s;e things; but it &s;hall ne|ver
be &s;aid they did not fore&s;ee it, and complain of the
<PB N="26" REF="25">
Wrong; they &s;hall not be taxt with Blindne&s;s, tho' they
may with Weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The <HI>Oxford</HI> Getleman they &s;ay, has again appear'd,
in the World to advance the Rites of the Church, in
An&s;wer to a late Pamphlet, call'd <HI>The Rights of the Di&s;|&s;enters.</HI></P>
<P>As to his Arguments, I leave him for the pre&s;ent to
his proper Adver&s;ary.&mdash;So far as he treats me with ill
Language, I &s;ay nothing to him, for a Railing Accu|&s;ation
is the Part of the Devil, Bear-Garden Language
is his particular Talent; and they that would have a far|ther
Character of him, are refer'd to a Certain Reverend
Bi&s;hop in <HI>England,</HI> who when he denyed him Orders,
not for his want of Learning, &s;o much as his want of
<HI>Manners</HI> and <HI>Morals,</HI> gave him al&s;o the Title he De|&s;erved,
by which he will be known to his Friends,
and to us, he is known in his Books, as a Pulpit Incen|diary,
the Churches Bloody Standard Bearer, the Trum|peter
&s;ent out by High Church Authority, in &s;pight of
the Queen and her Summons, <HI>to Preach again&s;t &V;nion,</HI> to
Proclaim open <HI>War between Parties,</HI> to Hang out <HI>Flags
of Defyance,</HI> and to tell her Maje&s;ty, &s;he cannot have a
true Zeal for the Church, unle&s;s &s;he plea&s;es <HI>to Break
her Word, and do &s;o too.</HI></P>
<P>Now among the Rights of the Church, if they can
bring it out, and prove to us, the Church of <HI>England</HI>
has a right of <HI>Coertion</HI> upon Con&s;cience, has a right to
per&s;ecute their Di&s;&s;enting Brethren, they gain their
point.</P>
<P>If they have a right to Compel us to come in, and
to force our Con&s;ciences; then 'tis certain we can have
no right to the Toleration, and the Queen in her Promi&s;es
to maintain it, Invaded the rights of the Church; for
we can have no right to that Freedom, which they have
a right to Limit, or Pre&s;cribe, and the Queen cannot
<PB N="27" REF="26">
promi&s;e to Maintain us, in that which they have a Right to
re&s;train and prevent,&mdash;Thus as the Di&s;&s;enters are brought
in, Claiming a Liberty, they have no Right to, the Queen
is al&s;o brought in, E&s;tabli&s;hing and Promi&s;ing us to Maintain
that Liberty, they have a Right to take away, and by con&s;e|quence
Invading the Rights of the Church.</P>
<P>And thus the Right of preventing Occa&s;ional Conformity,
will be pre&s;ently decided; and I am free to Challenge, all the
Advocates for it, to enter into the Argument, of which this is
the Ab&s;tract.</P>
<Q><P><HI>If the Church has a Right to Per&s;ecute for Con&s;cience;</HI> Then the
<HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have no Right to Toleration.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Church</HI> has a Right to <HI>Per&s;ecute;</HI> Ergo.</P></Q>
</DIV1>
<DIV1>
<HEAD>ECONTRA.</HEAD>
<Q><P>If the <HI>Church</HI> has no Right to <HI>Per&s;ecute for Con&s;cience Sake;</HI>
Then the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have a Right to the <HI>Liberty</HI> they now
Enjoy, by the <HI>Toleration;</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Church</HI> has no Right to <HI>Per&s;ecute,</HI> as it is prov'd
from the Apo&s;tles Words, <HI>whether it be Right to Obey God,
rather than Man, judge ye.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Ergo,</HI>&mdash;The <HI>Di&s;&s;enters</HI> have a Right to <HI>Liberty of Con|&s;cience,</HI>
and <HI>Toleration.</HI></P></Q>
<P>If the Church has a Right to Per&s;ecute, then the Queen can
have no Right to Tolerate; for two Contraries, cannot be E|rected
upon one Foundation of Right.</P>
<P>If then the Queen had no Right to Tolerate the Di&s;&s;enters,
by promi&s;ing to do &s;o, She promi&s;es to do what She cannot Le|gally
perform; and that Promi&s;e ought not to be kept.</P>
<P>But if the Church has no Right to Per&s;ecute, then had the
Queen a Right to give them a Toleration; and what it is
Lawful to Grant, it mu&s;t be Lawful to Continue; and there|fore
Her Maje&s;ty's Gracious Promi&s;e, mu&s;t be a Sacred Secu|rity
to us, becau&s;e She had an Undoubted Right to make
it.</P>
<P>So that the whole Argument mu&s;t Turn upon this, whe|ther
the Church, has a Right to force the Con&s;cience, or in
plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to Per&s;ecute for Con&s;cience Sake.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="27">
If they can get over this, the Argument is at an End, and
we mu&s;t Submit to any thing they plea&s;e to Inflict; they having
an Undoubted Right to Inflict it.</P>
<P>All the Di&s;&s;enters dependance therefore, and all their Moral
Security is plac'd, not in the Act of Toleration, for that may
be Mortal, but in Her Maje&s;ty's Sacred Promi&s;e.</P>
<P>And the Care Her Maje&s;ty has taken, to make us Ea&s;y on this
Head, is very Remarkable; and ought to Di$courage the
Party from the Attempt. We have a Promi&s;e, within a Promi&s;e;
The Queen, as if her Maje&s;ty had &s;een Occa&s;ion for more than
ordinary a&s;&s;urance, has given us fir&s;t a Promi&s;e, that She will
pre&s;erve the Toleration, and Protect the Di&s;&s;enters in their
Liberty of Con&s;cience; and She has Clinch'd this En|gagement,
by another as Solemn, wherein She Promi&s;es, to be
always a Religious Ob&s;erver of her Word.</P>
<P>What hopes then can any Party of Men entertain, of ma|king
the lea&s;t attack upon the Di&s;&s;enters Liberty, without
a barefac'd Pre&s;umption, that they &s;hall obtain upon Her Ma|je&s;ty
to break her Word?</P>
<P>Upon this Account it is, I would have the Di&s;&s;enters Ea&s;ie;
tho&s;e Endeavours which have been made u&s;e of to Ruine them,
have been in Vain; Her Maje&s;ty has kept her Promi&s;e hitherto,
and there is no need to fear, but She will keep it.</P>
<P>Some People perhaps pretend to &s;ay, when Her Maje&s;ty
made this Promi&s;e, She did not expect to be taken in &s;o large
a Sence; I can &s;ay nothing to that, further than that I don't
believe them.</P>
<P>But I believe, before the Late King's Death, had we told tho&s;e
Gentlemen, the Queen would have made &s;uch a Promi&s;e, they
would have &s;aid, <HI>we were mi&s;taken,</HI> when She did make it, they
found <HI>them&s;elves mi&s;taken.</HI> If the Queen thinks they like it,
<HI>Her Maje&s;ty is mi&s;taken,</HI> and if ever Her Maje&s;ty breaks it,
<HI>we &s;hall be all mi&s;taken.</HI></P>
