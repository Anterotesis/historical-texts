<HEAD>AN
ADDRESS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<OPENER>GENTLEMEN,</OPENER>
<P>HAD the que&s;tion of ye&s;terday been de|cided
in a manner more favourable to
our wi&s;hes, which however the previous inti|mations
of your temper in the bu&s;ine&s;s left us
little room to expect, we &s;hould have addre&s;&s;ed
our thanks to you on the occa&s;ion. As it is,
we addre&s;s to you our thanks for much ca&s;ual
light thrown upon the &s;ubject, and for many
incidental te&s;timonies of your e&s;teem (whe|ther
voluntary or involuntary we will not &s;top
to examine) which in the cour&s;e of this di&s;|cu&s;&s;ion
you have favoured us with. We thank
you for the compliment paid the Di&s;&s;enters,
when you &s;uppo&s;e that the moment they are
eligible to places of power and profit, all &s;uch
<PB N="4" REF="4">
places will at once be filled with them. Not
content with confounding, by an artful &s;o|phi&s;m,
the right of eligibility with the right
to offices, you again confound that right with
the probable fact, and then argue accordingly.
Is then the Te&s;t Act, your boafted bulwark, of
equal nece&s;&s;ity with the dykes in Holland;
and do we wait, like an impetuous &s;ea, to ru&s;h
in and overwhelm the land? Our preten|&s;ions,
Gentlemen, are far humbler. <HI>We</HI> had
not the pre&s;umption to imagine that, incon|&s;iderable
as we are in numbers, compared to
the e&s;tabli&s;hed Church; inferior too in for|tune
and influence; labouring, as we do,
under the frown of the Court, and the ana|thema
of the orthodox; we &s;hould make our
way &s;o readily into the &s;ecret rece&s;&s;es of royal
favour; and, of a &s;udden, like the frogs of
Egypt, &s;warm about your barns, and under
your canopies, and in your kneading troughs,
and in the chamber of the King. We rather
<PB N="5" REF="5">
wi&s;hed this act as a removal of a &s;tigma than
the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a certain advantage, and we
might have been cheaply plea&s;ed with the
acknowledgment of the right, though we had
never been fortunate enough to enjoy the
emolument.</P>
<P>Another compliment for which we offer
our acknowledgements may be extracted from
the great ferment, which has been rai&s;ed by
this bu&s;ine&s;s all over the country. What
&s;tir and movement has it occa&s;ioned among
the different orders of men! How quick
the alarm has been taken, and &s;ounded from
the Church to the Senate, and from the
pre&s;s to the people; while fears and fore|bodings
were communicated like an electric
&s;hock! The old cry of, <HI>the Church is in
danger,</HI> has again been made to vibrate in
our ears. Here too if we gave way to im|pre&s;&s;ions
of vanity, we might &s;uppo&s;e our|&s;elves
<PB N="6" REF="6">
of much greater importance in the
political &s;cale than our numbers and &s;i|tuation
&s;eem to indicate. It &s;hews at lea&s;t
we are feared, which to &s;ome minds would
be the next grateful thing to being beloved.
We, indeed, &s;hould only wi&s;h for the latter;
nor &s;hould we have ventured to &s;uppo&s;e, but
from the information you have given us,
that your Church <HI>was</HI> &s;o weak. What!
fenced and guarded as &s;he is with her ex|clu&s;ive
privileges and rich emoluments, &s;tately
with her learned halls and endowed colleges,
with all the attraction of her wealth, and
the thunder of her cen&s;ures; all that the
orator calls <HI>the maje&s;ty of the Church</HI> about
her, and does &s;he, re&s;ting in &s;ecurity under
the broad buckler of the State, does &s;he
tremble at the naked and unarmed &s;ectary?
he, who&s;e early connections, and phra&s;e
uncouth, and unpopular opinions &s;et him at
a di&s;tance from the means of advancement;
<PB N="7" REF="7">
he, who in the intercour&s;es of neighbourhood
and common life, like new &s;ettlers, finds
it nece&s;&s;ary to clear the ground before him,
and is ever obliged to root up a prejudice
before he can plant affection. He is not of
the world, Gentlemen, and the world loveth
her own. All that di&s;tingui&s;hes him from
other men to common ob&s;ervation, operates
in his disfavour. His very advocates, while
they plead his cau&s;e, are ready to blu&s;h for
their client; and in ju&s;tice to their own cha|racter
think it nece&s;&s;ary to di&s;claim all know|ledge
of his ob&s;cure tenets. And is it from
his hand you expect the demolition of &s;o
ma&s;&s;y an edifice? Does the &s;imple removal
of the Te&s;t Act involve its de&s;truction?
The&s;e were not <HI>our</HI> thoughts. <HI>We</HI> had too
much reverence for your e&s;tabli&s;hment to
imagine that the &s;tructure was &s;o loo&s;ely put
together, or &s;o much &s;haken by years, as that
the removal of &s;o &s;light a pin &s;hould endanger
<PB N="8" REF="8">
the whole fabric&mdash;or is the Te&s;t Act the <HI>tali&s;|man</HI>
which holds it together, that, when it is
broken, the whole mu&s;t fall to pieces like the
magic palace of an enchanter? Surely no &s;pecies
of regular architecture can depend upon &s;o
&s;light a &s;upport.&mdash;After all what is it
we have a&s;ked?&mdash;to &s;hare in the rich be|nefices
of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church? to have
the gates of her &s;chools and univer&s;ities
thrown open to us? No, let her keep her
golden prebends, her &s;carfs, her lawn,
her mitres. Let her dignitaries be &s;till a&s;|&s;ociated
to the honours of legi&s;lation; and,
in our courts of executive ju&s;tice, let her
inqui&s;itorial tribunals continue to thwart the
&s;pirit of a free con&s;titution by a heterogeneous
mixture of prie&s;tly juri&s;diction. Let her
&s;till gather into barns, though &s;he neither
&s;ows nor reaps. We de&s;ire not to &s;hare
in her good things. We know it is the
children's bread, which mu&s;t not be given
<PB N="9" REF="9">
to dogs. But <HI>having</HI> the&s;e good things, we
<HI>could</HI> wi&s;h to hear her &s;ay with the generous
&s;pirit of E&s;au, <HI>I have enough, my brother.</HI>
We could wi&s;h to be con&s;idered as children
of the State, though we are not &s;o of the
Church. She mu&s;t excu&s;e us if we look
upon the alliance between her and the State
as an ill &s;orted union, and her&s;elf as a mother-in-law
who, with the too frequent arts of
that relation, is ever endeavouring to prejudice
the State, the common parent of us all,
again&s;t a part of his offspring, for the &s;ake
of appropriating a larger portion to her own
children. We claim no &s;hare in the dowry
of her who is not our mother, but we may
be pardoned for thinking it hard to be de|prived
of the inheritance of our father.</P>
<P>But it is objected to us that we have
&s;inned in the manner of making our reque&s;t;
we have brought it forward as a claim in&s;tead
<PB N="10" REF="10">
of a&s;king it as a favour. We &s;hould have
&s;ued, and crept, and humbled our&s;elves.
Our preachers and our writers &s;hould not
have dared to expre&s;s the warm glow of
hone&s;t &s;entiment, or, even in a foreign country
glance at the downfall of a haughty ari&s;|tocracy.
As we were &s;uppliants, we &s;hould
have behaved like &s;uppliants, and then per|haps
&mdash;No, Gentlemen, we wi&s;h to have
it under&s;tood, that we <HI>do</HI> claim it as a right.
It lo&s;es otherwi&s;e half its value. We claim
it as men, we claim it as citizens, we claim
it as good &s;ubjects. We are not con&s;cious
of having brought the di&s;qualification upon
our&s;elves by a failure in any of the&s;e cha|racters.</P>
<P>But we already enjoy a complete toleration
&mdash;It is time, &s;o near the end of the eighteenth
century, it is &s;urely time to &s;peak with pre|ci&s;ion,
and to call things by their proper
<PB N="11" REF="11">
names. What you call toleration, we call the
exerci&s;e of a natural and unalienable right.
We do not conceive it to be toleration, fir&s;t
to &s;trip a man of all his deare&s;t rights, and
then to give him back a part; or even if it
were the whole. You tolerate us in wor|&s;hipping
God according to our con&s;ciences
&mdash;and why not tolerate a man in the u&s;e of
his limbs, in the di&s;po&s;al of his private pro|perty,
the contracting his dome&s;tic engage|ments,
or any other the mo&s;t acknowledged
privileges of humanity? It is not to the&s;e
things that the word toleration is applied
with propriety. It is applied, where from
lenity or prudence we forbear doing all which
in ju&s;tice we might do. It is the bearing
with what is confe&s;&s;edly an evil, for the
&s;ake of &s;ome good with which it is con|nected.
It is the Chri&s;tian virtue of long
&s;uffering; it is the political virtue of adapting
mea&s;ures to times and &s;ea&s;ons and &s;ituations.
<PB N="12" REF="12">
<HI>Abu&s;es</HI> are tolerated, when they are &s;o inter|woven
with the texture of the piece, that the
operation of removing them becomes too deli|cate
and hazardous. <HI>Unju&s;t claims</HI> are tole|rated,
when they are complied with for the &s;ake
of peace and con&s;cience. The failings and
imperfections of tho&s;e characters in which
there appears an evident preponderancy of
virtue, are tolerated. The&s;e are the proper
objects of toleration, the&s;e exerci&s;e the pa|tience
of the Chri&s;tian and the prudence of
the State&s;man; but if there be a power that
advances pretences which we think un|founded
in rea&s;on or &s;cripture, that exerci&s;es
an empire within an empire, and claims &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
from tho&s;e naturally her equals; and
if we, from a &s;pirit of brotherly charity, and
ju&s;t deference to public opinion, and a &s;alu|tary
dread of innovation, acquie&s;ce in the&s;e
preten&s;ions; let her at lea&s;t be told that the
virtue of forbearance &s;hould be transferred,
<PB N="13" REF="13">
and that it is we who tolerate her, not &s;he
who tolerates us.</P>
<P><HI>Complete Toleration,</HI> though an expre&s;&s;ion
often adverted to by both parties, is in truth
a &s;oleci&s;m in terms; for all that is tolerated
ought to be done away whenever it is found
practicable and expedient. Complete Conva|le&s;cence
is no longer Convale&s;cence, but
Health; and complete Toleration is no longer
Toleration, but Liberty. Let the term there|fore
be di&s;carded, which, however &s;oftened,
involves in it an in&s;ult with regard to us, and
however extended, an ab&s;urdity with regard to
your&s;elves. Sen&s;ible that a &s;pirit of liberality
requires the indulgence to be <HI>complete,</HI> and
de&s;irous at the &s;ame time to retain the idea of
our holding it through &s;ufferance and not of
right, you have been betrayed into this incon|gruity
of expre&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e are always liable
to be betrayed into &s;uch, who have not the
<PB N="14" REF="14">
courage to embrace a &s;y&s;tem in its full extent,
and to follow a principle wherever it may lead
them. Hence the <HI>progre&s;s</HI> from Error to
Truth, and from Bigotry to the mo&s;t enlarged
freedom of &s;entiment, is marked with greater
<HI>incon&s;i&s;tencies</HI> than that &s;tate in which the mind
quietly re&s;ts in the former po&s;ition. It is
only when we view objects by a dubious and
uncertain twilight that we are apt to mi&s;take
their figure and di&s;tances, and to be di&s;turbed
by groundle&s;s terrors; in perfect darkne&s;s we
form no judgment about them.&mdash;It has ever
been the untoward fate of your Church to
partake largely of the&s;e incon&s;i&s;tencies. Placed
between the Catholics on one &s;ide, and the
Di&s;&s;enters on the other, &s;he has not been able
to defend either her re&s;i&s;tance or her re&s;traints,
and lies equally open to cen&s;ure for her per|&s;ecution
and her di&s;&s;ent. Pre&s;&s;ed by the dif|ficulties
of her peculiar &s;ituation, &s;he is con|tinually
obliged in the cour&s;e of her polemic
<PB N="15" REF="15">
warfare to change her ground, and alter her
mode of defence; and like the poor Bat in the
fable, to tell a different &s;tory upon every new
attack; and thus it mu&s;t be, till &s;he &s;hall
have the magnanimity to make u&s;e of all her
light, and follow her rea&s;on without re&s;erve.</P>
<P>For Truth is of a nature &s;trangely encroach|ing,
and ought to be kept out entirely if we
are not di&s;po&s;ed to admit her with perfect
freedom. You cannot &s;ay to her, Thus far
&s;halt thou go, and no further. Give her the
lea&s;t entrance, and &s;he will never be &s;atisfied
till &s;he has gained entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Allow
her but a few plain axioms to work with, and
&s;tep by &s;tep, &s;yllogi&s;m after &s;yllogi&s;m, &s;he
in&s;en&s;ibly mines her way into the very heart
of her enemy's entrenchments. Truth is of a
very intolerant &s;pirit. She will not make any
compromi&s;e with Error, and if &s;he be obliged
to hold any fellow&s;hip with her, it is &s;uch
<PB N="16" REF="16">
fellow&s;hip as light has with darkne&s;s, a per|petual
warfare and oppo&s;ition. Every con|ce&s;&s;ion
made by her antagoni&s;t is turned into a
fre&s;h weapon again&s;t her, and being her&s;elf in|vulnerable,
&s;he is &s;ure to gain by each &s;ucce&s;|&s;ive
conte&s;t, till her adver&s;ary is driven from
every &s;helter and lurking-hole, and fairly
obliged to quit po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the field.</P>
<P>But this, it is again imputed to us, is no
conte&s;t for religious liberty, but a conte&s;t for
power, and place, and influence. We want
civil offices&mdash;And why &s;hould citizens <HI>not</HI>
a&s;pire to civil offices? Why &s;hould not the
fair field of generous competition be freely
opened to every one!&mdash;A contention for
power&mdash;It is not a contention for power be|tween
Churchmen and Di&s;&s;enters, nor is it as
Di&s;&s;enters we wi&s;h to enter the li&s;ts; we wi&s;h
to bury every name of di&s;tinction in the com|mon
appellation of Citizen. We wi&s;h not
<PB N="17" REF="17">
the name of Di&s;&s;enter to be pronounced, ex|cept
in our theological re&s;earches and religious
a&s;&s;emblies. It is you, who by con&s;idering us
as Aliens, make us &s;o. It is you who force
us to make our di&s;&s;ent a prominent feature in
our character. It is you who give relief, and
cau&s;e to come out upon the canvas what we
mode&s;tly wi&s;hed to have &s;haded over, and
thrown into the back ground. If we are a
party, remember it is you who force us to be
&s;o.&mdash;We &s;hould have &s;ought places of tru&s;t&mdash;
By no unfair, uncon&s;titutional methods &s;hould
we have &s;ought them, but in the open and
honourable rival&s;hip of virtuous emulation;
by trying to de&s;erve well of our King and our
Country. Our attachment to both is well
known.</P>
<P>Perhaps however we have all this while
mi&s;taken the matter, and what we have taken
for bigotry and a narrow-minded &s;pirit is
<PB N="18" REF="18">
after all only an affair of calculation and arith|metic.
Our fellow-&s;ubjects remember the
homely proverb, &startq;the fewer the better
cheer,&endq; and, very naturally, are glad to &s;ee
the number of candidates le&s;&s;ened for the ad|vantages
they are them&s;elves &s;triving after.
If &s;o, we a&s;k their excu&s;e, their conduct is
quite &s;imple, and if, from the number of
concurrents, Government were to &s;trike out
all above or under five feet high, or all who&s;e
birth-days happened before the Summer Sol|&s;tice,
or, by any other mode of di&s;tinction
equally arbitrary and whim&s;ical were to reduce
the number of their rivals, <HI>they</HI> would be
equally plea&s;ed, and equally unwilling to ad|mit
an alteration. We are a mercantile peo|ple,
accu&s;tomed to con&s;ider chances, and we
can ea&s;ily perceive that in the lottery of life, if
a certain proportion are by &s;ome means or other
excluded from a prize, the adventure is ex|actly
&s;o much the better for the remainder.
<PB N="19" REF="19">
If this indeed be the ca&s;e, as I &s;u&s;pect it may,
we have been accu&s;ing you wrongfully. Your
conduct is founded upon principles as &s;ure and
unvarying as mathematical truths; and all
further di&s;cu&s;&s;ion is needle&s;s. We drop the
argument at once. Men have now and then
been rea&s;oned out of their prejudices, but it
were a hopele&s;s attempt to rea&s;on them out of
their intere&s;t.</P>
<P>We likewi&s;e beg leave to apologize to tho&s;e
of the clergy, whom we have unwittingly of|fended
by endeavouring to include <HI>them</HI> as
parties in our cau&s;e. &startq;Pricked to it by
fooli&s;h hone&s;ty and love,&endq; we thought that
what appeared &s;o grievous to us could not be
very plea&s;ant to them: but we are convinced
of our mi&s;take, and &s;orry for our officiou&s;ne&s;s.
We own it, Sirs, it was a fond imagination
that becau&s;e <HI>we</HI> &s;hould have felt unea&s;y under
the obligation impo&s;ed upon you, it &s;hould
<PB N="20" REF="20">
have the &s;ame effect upon your&s;elves. It was
weak to impute to you an idle delicacy of
con&s;cience, which perhaps can only be pre|&s;erved
at a di&s;tance from the &s;plendid &s;cenes
which you have continually in pro&s;pect. But
you will pardon us. We did not con&s;ider the
force of early di&s;cipline over the mind. <HI>We</HI>
are not accu&s;tomed to tho&s;e &s;alvos, and glo&s;&s;es,
and accommodating modes of rea&s;oning with
which you have been long familiarized. You
have the happy art of making ea&s;y to your|&s;elves
greater things than this. You are re|gularly
di&s;ciplined troops, and under&s;tand every
nice manoeuvre and dextrous evolution which
the nature of the ground may require. We
are like an unbroken hor&s;e; hard mouthed,
and apt to &s;tart at &s;hadows. Our conduct
towards you in this particular we acknowledge
may fairly provoke a &s;mile at our &s;implicity.
Be&s;ides, upon reflection what &s;hould you &s;tartle
at? The mixture of &s;ecular and religious
<PB N="21" REF="21">
concerns cannot to you appear extraordinary;
and in truth nothing is more rea&s;onable than
that, as the State has been drawn in to the
aggrandizement of your Church, your Church
&s;hould in return make it&s;elf &s;ub&s;ervient to the
convenience of the State. If we are wi&s;e, we
&s;hall never again make our&s;elves unea&s;y about
your &s;hare of the grievance.</P>
<P>But we were enumerating our obligations
to you, Gentlemen, who have thwarted our
reque&s;t, and we mu&s;t take the liberty to in|form
you that if it be any object of our am|bition
to exi&s;t and attract notice as a &s;eparate
body, you have done us the greate&s;t &s;ervice in
the world. What we de&s;ired, by blending us
with the common ma&s;s of citizens, would
have &s;unk our relative importance, and con|&s;igned
our di&s;cu&s;&s;ions to oblivion. You have
refu&s;ed us; and by &s;o doing, you keep us
under the eye of the public, in the intere&s;ting
<PB N="22" REF="22">
point of view of men who &s;uffer under a depri|vation
of their rights. You have &s;et a mark
of &s;eparation upon us, and it is not in our
power to take it off, but it is in our power to
determine whether it &s;hall be a di&s;graceful
&s;tigma or an honourable di&s;tinction. If, by
the continued peaceablene&s;s of our demeanour,
and the &s;uperior &s;obriety of our conver&s;ation,
a &s;obriety for which we have not yet quite
cea&s;ed to be di&s;tingui&s;hed; if, by our attention
to literature, and that ardent love of liberty
which you are pretty ready to allow us, we de|&s;erve
e&s;teem, we &s;hall enjoy it. If our ri&s;ing
&s;eminaries &s;hould excel in whole&s;ome di&s;ci|pline
and regularity, if <HI>they</HI> &s;hould be &s;chools
of morality, and yours, unhappily, &s;hould be
corrupted into &s;chools of immorality, you will
entru&s;t us with the education of your youth,
when the parent, trembling at the profligacy
of the times, wi&s;hes to pre&s;erve the blooming
and ingenuous child from the degrading taint
<PB N="23" REF="23">
of early licentiou&s;ne&s;s. If our writers are
&s;olid, elegant, or nervous, you will read our
books and imbibe our &s;entiments, and even
your Preachers will not di&s;dain, occa&s;ionally, to
<HI>illu&s;trate</HI> our morality. If we enlighten the
world by philo&s;ophical di&s;coveries, you will
pay the involuntary homage due to genius,
and boa&s;t of our names when, among&s;t foreign
&s;ocieties, you are inclined to do credit to your
country. If your re&s;traints operate towards
keeping us in that middle rank of life where
indu&s;try and virtue mo&s;t abound, we &s;hall
have the honour to count our&s;elves among
that cla&s;s of the community which has ever
been the &s;ource of manners, of population and
of wealth. If we &s;eek for fortune in that
track which you have left mo&s;t open to us,
we &s;hall increa&s;e your commercial importance.
If, in &s;hort, we render our&s;elves worthy of
re&s;pect, you cannot hinder us from being
re&s;pected&mdash;you cannot help re&s;pecting us&mdash;
<PB N="24" REF="24">
and in &s;pite of all names of opprobrious &s;epa|ration,
we &s;hall be bound together by mutual
e&s;teem and the mutual reciprocation of good
offices.</P>
<P>One good office we &s;hall mo&s;t probably
do you is rather an invidious one, and &s;el|dom
meets with thanks. By laying us under
&s;uch a marked di&s;qualification, you have
rendered us&mdash;we hope not uncandid&mdash;we
hope not di&s;affected&mdash;May the God of love
and charity pre&s;erve us from all &s;uch acrimo|nious
di&s;po&s;itions! But you certainly have,
as far as in you lies, rendered us quick &s;ighted
to encroachment and abu&s;es of all kinds. We
have the feelings of men; and though we
&s;hould be very blameable to &s;uffer our&s;elves to
be bia&s;&s;ed by any private hard&s;hips, and hope
that, as a body, we never &s;hall, yet this you
will con&s;ider, that we have at lea&s;t no bias on
the other &s;ide. We have no favours to blind
<PB N="25" REF="25">
us, no golden padlock on our tongues, and
therefore it is probable enough, that, if cau&s;e
is given, we &s;hall cry aloud and &s;pare not.
But in this you have done your&s;elves no di&s;|&s;ervice.
It is perfectly agreeable to the jealous
&s;pirit of a free con&s;titution that there &s;hould
be &s;ome who will &s;ea&s;on the ma&s;s with the
whole&s;ome &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition. Without a
little of that bitter leaven there is great danger
of its being corrupted.</P>
<P>With regard to our&s;elves, you have by
your late determination given perhaps a &s;alu|tary,
perhaps a &s;ea&s;onable check to that &s;pirit
of worldline&s;s, which of late has gained but
too much ground among&s;t us. Before you&mdash;before
the world&mdash;we have a right to bear the
brow erect, to talk of rights and &s;ervices;
but there is a place and a pre&s;ence where it
will become us to make no boa&s;t. We, as
well as you, are infected. We, as well
<PB N="26" REF="26">
as you, have breathed in the univer&s;al
contagion&mdash;a contagion more noxious, and
more difficult to e&s;cape, than that which on
the plains of Cher&s;on has ju&s;t &s;wept from
the world the martyr of humanity; the con|tagion
of &s;elfi&s;h indifference, and fa&s;hionable
manners has &s;eized us: and our langui&s;hing
virtue feels the debilitating influence.&mdash;If you
were more conver&s;ant in our a&s;&s;emblies than
your prejudices will permit you to be, you
would &s;ee indifference, where you fancy there
is an over proportion of zeal: you would &s;ee
principles giving way, and families melting
into the bo&s;om of the church under the warm
influence of pro&s;perity. You would &s;ee that
e&s;tabli&s;hments, without calling coercive mea|&s;ures
to their aid, po&s;&s;e&s;s attraction enough
&s;everely to try the virtue and &s;teadine&s;s of tho&s;e
who &s;eparate from them. You need not &s;trew
thorns, or put bars acro&s;s our path; your
golden apples are &s;ufficient to make us turn
<PB N="27" REF="27">
out of the way. Believe me, Gentlemen,
you do not <HI>know</HI> us &s;ufficiently to aim your
cen&s;ure where we &s;hould be mo&s;t vulnerable.</P>
<P>Nor need you apprehend from us the &s;lighte&s;t
danger to your own e&s;tabli&s;hment. If you
will needs have it that it <HI>is</HI> in danger, we wi&s;h
you to be aware that the danger ari&s;es from
among your&s;elves. If ever your creeds and
formularies become as grievous to the gene|rality
of your Clergy as they already are to
many delicate and thinking minds among&s;t
them; if ever any material articles of your
profe&s;&s;ed belief &s;hould be generally di&s;believed,
or that order which has been accu&s;tomed to
&s;upply faithful pa&s;tors and learned enquirers
after truth &s;hould become a burden upon a
generous public; and if her dignities and
emoluments, in&s;tead of being graced by merit
or genius, and thus in &s;ome mea&s;ure balancing
the weight of hereditary honour and in|fluence,
<PB N="28" REF="28">
&s;hould be con&s;idered as appendages
to them, the cry for reformation would
then be loud and prevailing. It <HI>would</HI>
be heard. Doctrines which will not &s;tand
the te&s;t of argument and rea&s;on will not always
be believed, and when they have cea&s;ed to be
generally believed they will not long be arti|cles
of belief. If therefore there is any weak
place in your &s;y&s;tem, any thing which you
are obliged to glo&s;s over, and touch with a
tender hand, any thing which &s;hrinks at in|ve&s;tigation
&mdash;Look ye to it, its extinction is
not far off. Doubts and difficulties, that
ari&s;e fir&s;t among&s;t the learned, will not &s;top
there; they inevitably &s;pread downwards from
cla&s;s to cla&s;s; and if the people &s;hould ever
find that your articles are generally &s;ub&s;cribed
as articles of peace, they will be apt to re|member
that they are articles of expence too.
If all the Di&s;&s;enters in the kingdom, &s;till be|lieving
as Di&s;&s;enters do, were this moment,
<PB N="29" REF="29">
in order to avoid the reproach of &s;chi&s;m, to
enter the pale of your church, they would do
you mi&s;chief; they would ha&s;ten its decline;
and if all who in their hearts di&s;&s;ent from
your profe&s;&s;ions of faith were to cea&s;e making
them, and throw them&s;elves among&s;t the
Di&s;&s;enters, you would &s;tand the firmer for it.
Your church is in no danger becau&s;e we are of
a different church; they might &s;tand together
to the end of time without interference; but
it will be in great danger whenever it has
within it&s;elf many who have thrown a&s;ide its
doctrines, or even, who do not embrace them
in the &s;imple and obvious &s;en&s;e. All the
power and policy of man cannot continue a
&s;y&s;tem <HI>long</HI> after its truth has cea&s;ed to be
acknowledged, or an e&s;tabli&s;hment <HI>long</HI> after
it has cea&s;ed to contribute to utility. It is
equally vain, as to expect to pre&s;erve a tree,
who&s;e roots are cut away. It may look as
green and flouri&s;hing as before for a &s;hort
<PB N="30" REF="30">
time, but its &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed, its principle
of life is gone, and death is already within it.
If then you think the church in danger, be
not backward to pre&s;erve the &s;ound by &s;acri|ficing
the decayed.</P>
<P>To return to our&s;elves, and our feelings
on the bu&s;ine&s;s lately in agitation&mdash;
You will excu&s;e us if we do not appear
with the air of men baffled and di&s;ap|pointed.
Neither do we blu&s;h at our defeat;
we may blu&s;h, indeed, but it is for our coun|try;
but we lay hold on the con&s;oling per&s;ua|&s;ion,
that rea&s;on, truth and liberality mu&s;t finally
prevail. We appeal from Philip intoxicated
to Philip &s;ober. We know you will refu&s;e us
while you are narrow minded, but you will
not always be narrow minded. You have too
much light and candour not to have more.
We will no more attempt to pluck the green
unripe fruit. We &s;ee in you our future friends
<PB N="31" REF="31">
and brethren, eager to confound and blend
with ours your intere&s;ts and your affections.
You will grant us all we a&s;k. The only
que&s;tion between us is, whether you will do
it to-day&mdash;To-morrow you certainly will.
You will even intreat us, if need were, to allow
you to remove from your country the &s;tigma of
illiberality. We appeal to the certain, &s;ure
operation of increa&s;ing light and knowledge,
which it is no more in your power to &s;top,
than to repel the tide with your naked hand,
or to wither with your breath the genial in|fluence
of vegetation. The &s;pread of that
light is in general gradual and imperceptible;
but there are periods when its progre&s;s is ac|celerated,
when it &s;eems with a &s;udden fla&s;h
to open the firmament, and pour in day at
once. Can ye not di&s;cern the &s;igns of the
times? The minds of men are in movement
from the Bory&s;thenes to the Atlantic. Agi|tated
with new and &s;trong emotions, they
<PB N="32" REF="32">
&s;well and heave beneath oppre&s;&s;ion, as the
&s;eas within the Polar Circle, when, at the
approach of Spring, they grow impatient to
bur&s;t their icy chains; when what, but an
in&s;tant before, &s;eemed &s;o firm, &s;pread for
many a dreary league like a floor of &s;olid mar|ble,
at once with a tremendous noi&s;e gives
way, long fi&s;&s;ures &s;pread in every direction,
and the air re&s;ounds with the cla&s;h of floating
fragments, which every hour are broken
from the ma&s;s. The genius of Philo&s;ophy is
walking abroad, and with the touch of Ithu|riel's
&s;pear is trying the e&s;tabli&s;hments of the
earth. The various forms of Prejudice, Su|per&s;tition
and Servility &s;tart up in their true
&s;hapes, which had long impo&s;ed upon the
world under the revered &s;emblances of Ho|nour,
Faith, and Loyalty. Whatever is loo&s;e
mu&s;t be &s;haken, whatever is corrupted mu&s;t
be lopt away; whatever is not built on the
broad ba&s;is of public utility mu&s;t be thrown
<PB N="33" REF="33">
to the ground. Ob&s;cure murmurs gather,
and &s;well into a tempe&s;t; the &s;pirit of En|quiry,
like a &s;evere and &s;earching wind, pe|netrates
every part of the great body politic;
and whatever is un&s;ound, whatever is infirm,
&s;hrinks at the vi&s;itation. Liberty, here with
the lifted cro&s;ier in her hand, and the crucifix
con&s;picuous on her brea&s;t; there led by Phi|lo&s;ophy,
and crowned with the civic wreath,
animates men to a&s;&s;ert their long forgotten
rights. With a policy, far more liberal and
comprehen&s;ive than the boa&s;ted e&s;tabli&s;hments
of Greece and Rome, &s;he diffu&s;es her ble&s;|&s;ings
to every cla&s;s of men; and even extends
a &s;mile of hope and promi&s;e to the poor Afri|can,
the victim of hard, impenetrable avarice.
Man, <HI>as</HI> man, becomes an object of re&s;pect.
Tenets are transferred from theory to practice.
The glowing &s;entiment and the lofty &s;pecula|tion
no longer &s;erve &startq;but to adorn the pages
of a book;&endq; they are brought home to men's
<PB N="34" REF="34">
bu&s;ine&s;s and bo&s;oms; and, what &s;ome cen|turies
ago it was daring but to think, and
dangerous to expre&s;s, is now realized, and
carried into effect. Sy&s;tems are analy&s;ed into
their fir&s;t principles, and principles are fairly
pur&s;ued to their legitimate con&s;equences. The
enemies of reformation, who palliate what
they cannot defend, and defer what they dare
not refu&s;e; who, with Fe&s;tus, put off to a
more convenient &s;ea&s;on what, only becau&s;e it
is the pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on is inconvenient, &s;tand
agha&s;t; and find they have no power to put
back the important hour, when nature is la|bouring
with the birth of great events. Can
ye not di&s;cern&mdash;But you do di&s;cern the&s;e
&s;igns; you di&s;cern them well, and your alarm
is apparent. You &s;ee a mighty empire break|ing
from bondage, and exerting the energies
of recovered freedom: and England&mdash;which
was u&s;ed to glory in being the a&s;&s;ertor of li|berty,
and refuge of the oppre&s;&s;ed&mdash;Eng|land,
<PB N="35" REF="35">
who with generous and re&s;pectful &s;ym|pathy,
in times not far remote from our own
memory, has afforded an a&s;ylum to &s;o many
of the &s;ubjects of that very empire, when
cru&s;hed beneath the iron rod of per&s;ecution;
and, by &s;o doing, circulated a livelier abhor|rence
of tyranny within her own veins&mdash;
England, who has long reproached her with
being a &s;lave now cen&s;ures her for daring to
be free. England, who has held the torch
to her, is mortified to &s;ee it blaze brighter in
her hands. England, for whom, and for
who&s;e manners and habits of thinking, that
empire has, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, felt even an
enthu&s;ia&s;tic prediliction; and to whom, as a
model of laws and government, &s;he looks
up with affectionate reverence&mdash;England,
nur&s;ed at the brea&s;t of liberty, and breathing
the pure&s;t &s;pirit of enlightened philo&s;ophy,
views a &s;i&s;ter nation with affected &s;corn and
real jealou&s;y, and pre&s;umes to a&s;k whether &s;he
<PB N="36" REF="36">
yet exi&s;ts&mdash;Yes, all of her exi&s;ts that is
worthy to do &s;o. Her dungeons indeed exi&s;t
no longer, the iron doors are forced, the ma&s;&s;y
walls are thrown down; and the liberated
&s;pectres, trembling between joy and horror,
may now blazon the infernal &s;ecrets of their
pri&s;on hou&s;e. Her cloi&s;tered Monks no longer
exi&s;t, nor does the &s;oft heart of &s;en&s;ibility beat
behind the grate of a convent, but the be&s;t
affections of the human mind permitted to
flow in their natural channel, diffufe their
friendly influence over the brightening pro&s;|pect
of dome&s;tic happine&s;s. Nobles, the
creatures of Kings, exi&s;t there no longer; but
Man, the creature of God, exi&s;ts there.
Millions of men exi&s;t there who, only now,
truly begin to exi&s;t, and hail with &s;houts of
grateful acclamation the better birth-day of
their country. Go on, generous nation, &s;et
the world an example of virtues as you have
of talents. Be our model, as we have been
<PB N="37" REF="37">
yours. May the &s;pirit of wi&s;dom, the &s;pirit
of moderation, the &s;pirit of firmne&s;s, guide
and ble&s;s your coun&s;els. With intelligence to
di&s;cern the be&s;t po&s;&s;ible, may you have pru|dence
to be content with the be&s;t practicable.
Overcome our wayward perver&s;ene&s;s by your
&s;teadine&s;s and temper. Silence the &s;coff of your
enemies, and the mi&s;giving fears of your timo|rous
well-wi&s;hers. Go on to de&s;troy the empire
of prejudices, that empire of gigantic &s;hadows,
which are only formidable while they are not
attacked. Cau&s;e to &s;ucceed to the mad am|bition
of conque&s;t the pacific indu&s;try of
commerce, and the &s;imple, u&s;eful toils of
agriculture. While your corn &s;prings up under
the &s;hade of your Olives, may bread and peace
be the portion of the Hu&s;bandman; and when
beneath your ardent &s;un, his brow is bathed in
hone&s;t &s;weat, let no one dare any longer with hard
and vexatious exactions to wring from him the
bitter drop of angui&s;h. In&s;tructed by the expe|rience
<PB N="38" REF="38">
of pa&s;t centuries, and by many a &s;ad and
&s;anguine page in your own hi&s;tories, may you
no more attempt to blend what God has made
&s;eparate; but may religion and civil polity, like
the two nece&s;&s;ary but oppo&s;ite elements of fire
and water, each in its province do &s;ervice to
mankind, but never again be forced into di&s;cor|dant
union. Let the wandering pilgrims of
every tribe and complexion, who in other
lands find only an a&s;ylum, find with you a
country, and may you never &s;eek other proof
of the purity of your faith than the large|ne&s;s
of your charity. In your manners, your
language, and habits of life, let a manly &s;im|plicity,
becoming the intercour&s;e of equals
with equals, take the place of over&s;trained re|finement
and adulation. Let public reforma|tion
prepare the way for private. May the
abolition of dome&s;tic tyranny introduce the
mode&s;t train of hou&s;hold virtues, and purer
incen&s;e be burned upon the hallowed altar of
<PB N="39" REF="39">
conjugal fidelity. Exhibit to the world the
rare phoenomenon of a patriot mini&s;ter, of a
philo&s;ophic &s;enate. May a pure and perfect
&s;y&s;tem of legi&s;lation proceed from their form|ing
hands, free from tho&s;e irregularities and
abu&s;es, the wear and tear of a con&s;titution,
which in a cour&s;e of years are nece&s;&s;arily ac|cumulated
in the be&s;t formed States; and
like the new creation in its fir&s;t glo&s;s and
fre&s;hne&s;s, yet free from any taint of corrup|tion,
when its Maker ble&s;t and called it good.
May you never lo&s;e &s;ight of the great prin|ciple
you have held forth, the natural equality
of men. May you never forget that without
public &s;pirit there can be no liberty; that
without virtue there may be a confederacy,
but cannot be a community. May you, and
may we, con&s;igning to oblivion every le&s;s ge|nerous
competition, only conte&s;t who &s;hall
