<HEAD>The PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THis &s;mall Treati&s;e is only levell'd again&s;t tho&s;e
Opera's which are entirely Mu&s;ical; for tho&s;e
which are Drammatical may be partly defended by
the Examples of the Ancients. We have endeavour'd
to &s;hew in the following Treati&s;e, that the Engli&s;h Stage
is like to be overthrown by the Progre&s;s of the&s;e new
Opera's; it would be ea&s;ie here to &s;hew the Importance
of that Stage to the Publick: That People mu&s;t and will
have Diver&s;ions, and that a great and flouri&s;hing Peo|ple
will have publick Diver&s;ions, that if the Govern|ment
does not take care to provide rea&s;onable Diver&s;ions
for them, they will not fail to provide &s;uch for them|&s;elves
as are without Rea&s;on. That unrea&s;onable ones
are pernicious to Government, and that rea&s;onable ones
are advantagious to it; that plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e being
too much indulged, makes Rea&s;on cea&s;e to be a Plea&s;ure,
and by con&s;equence is contrary both to publick and pri|vate
Duty. That the Drama of all rea&s;onable Diver|&s;ions
is the be&s;t that has ever been invented at once
to delight and in&s;truct the World, that it has never
flouri&s;h'd but in Three or Four of the brave&s;t Nations
that have been &s;ince the World began, and that in the
mo&s;t flouri&s;hing States of tho&s;e Nations, and that
<PB REF="3">
a People mu&s;t have a very good &s;hare of Virtue as well
at Under&s;tanding before they can receive it among them,
that it is &s;o very agreeable to good Government, that mo&s;t
of the great Men who have writ of the Art of Govern|ing,
from <HI>Plato</HI> down to <HI>Harrington,</HI> have writ
either Plays or Directions, or Rules for the Stage.
That &s;ome of the greate&s;t Monarchs and greate&s;t Mi|ni&s;ters
of State have not only encourag'd Plays, but
have writ them them&s;elves; that &s;ome of the greate&s;t
Philo&s;ophers have done the &s;ame, that here in <HI>England</HI>
indeed Two or Three formal affected Bigots have en|deavour'd
to contradict all the&s;e and the common Sen&s;e
of Men, and upon a pretence of making all Men good
Chri&s;tians, which Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles have &s;o often
told us never will be, have actually made Thou&s;ands
ten times wor&s;e than they would have been without them.
That the con&s;equence of their Writings has been, that
Plays have been for &s;ome Years di&s;courag'd, and Diver|&s;ions
e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the room of them, that have really
been and are like to be ten times more prejudicial to the
Publick than ever Plays were pretended to be. That
one of tho&s;e Diver&s;ions has been gaming, which has done
un&s;peakable harm to bath Sexes in every part of the
Town: That gaming, &s;ince the publi&s;hing the Books
again&s;t the Stage has increas'd Ten-fold, and that the
number of Bankrupts during that time has been as much
augmented; that the number of Cuckolds in all likely|hood
has advanced proportionably; That gaming, by
<PB REF="4">
giving Men a privilege to be familiar with, and
&s;ometimes rude to Women, removes that awe which
Nature has plac'd between the Sexes as the &s;tronge&s;t
Bulwark of Cha&s;tity; that when a young Lady ev'n
of the &s;tricte&s;t and mo&s;t unblemi&s;h'd Honour, loo&s;es a
Summ of Money, which &s;he dares not own to her Re|lations,
and which &s;he cannot pay without them, and
loo&s;es it to a young agreeable Fellow, who perhaps loves
her, and has a &s;ecret De&s;ign upon her, &s;he finds a
Temptation that tries her utmo&s;t Virtue.</P>
<P>We have endeavour'd to &s;hew in the following Trea|ti&s;e,
by the force of Rea&s;on, that the <HI>Italian Opera,</HI>
another Entertainment, which is about to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd
in the room of Plays, is a Diver&s;ion of more pernicious
con&s;equence, than the mo&s;t licentious Play that ever has
appear'd upon the Stage. It would be no hard matter
to &s;upport tho&s;e Proofs by the Authorities of &s;ome of the
mo&s;t celebrated Authors among the Ancients and Mo|derns,
but we &s;hall content our &s;elves with that of
<HI>Boileau,</HI> becau&s;e he is equally fam'd for Judgment
and Sincerity, excepting Matters in which his King is
concern'd, and is known by all the World to be perfectly
Ma&s;ter of the Subject. Let us &s;ee then what this ce|lebrated
Author, who has approv'd of Plays, in &s;o &s;o|lemn
and publick a manner, &s;ays in relation to Opera's.
The Pa&s;&s;age is in his Tenth Satyr, which is writ
by way of Letter to a Friend to advi&s;e him not
to marry.</P>

<P>The Wife of whom thou art about to make choice, having been
hitherto unblemi&s;h;d in her Conduct, and brought up, as they tell
us within Port Royal, in the Practice of every Virtue, regulates
her Pa&s;&s;ions by Rea&s;ons &s;evere Rule; but who can a&s;&s;ure thee that
&s;he will &s;till remain victorious over Plea&s;ure, and &s;till pre&s;erve her
original Innocence, when thou ha&s;t once made her Mi&s;tre&s;s of her
own Conduct? As &s;oon as &s;he is u&s;her'd by her Uxorious Husband
to the Opera, with what Air do&s;t thou think the young Saint will
behold the Harmonious Pomp of an enchanting Spectacle, tho&s;e
$$anton Dances, tho&s;e Heroes with luxurious Voices? With what
Air do&s;t thou think &s;he will li&s;ten to a Di&s;cour&s;e that rowls upon
<PB REF="6">
Love alone, to tho&s;e mad Orlandos, and tho&s;e melting Rinaldo's;
hearing from them that we ought to &s;acrifice all, nay, ev'n Virtue
it&s;elf, to Love, as to the only &s;upreme Divinity; that we can never
&s;uffer our &s;elves to take Fire too &s;oon, that bounteous Heaven has
be&s;tow'd a Heart upon us only that we might love; and all tho&s;e
common places of &s;lippery Morals, to which <HI>Lully</HI> has given fre&s;h
Fire by the Charms of his Mu&s;ick. Then how will &s;he be melted,
how tran&s;ported, how will every Sen&s;e be &s;haken in her? I dare not
a&s;&s;ure thee, that as &s;he comes back, throwing off that Awe which
has hitherto been a re&s;traint upon her, and having all her Soul
po&s;&s;e&s;t with tho&s;e melting Sounds, &s;he does not in&s;tantly withdraw
to &s;ome convenient Retirement, and with &s;ome young Medoro bring
the&s;e fine Speculations to practi&s;e. Yet let us &s;uppo&s;e for once, that
&s;he comes back as faithful and cha&s;t as &s;he went from this dange|rous
Shock, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Nothing can be fuller than this Pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Boileau;</HI>
we could ea&s;ily make it appear that <HI>Plato</HI> and <HI>Cicero</HI>
are of the &s;ame Opinion, but what need can there be
of Authorities, when we can &s;hew by experience what
Influence the &s;oft and effeminate Mea&s;ures of the
<HI>Italian Opera</HI> has upon the Minds and Manners of
Men. The Modern Italians have the very &s;ame Sun
and Soil which the Antient Romans had, yet are their
Manners directly oppo&s;ite; their Men are neither Ver|tuous,
nor Wi&s;e, nor Valiant, and they who have rea|&s;on
to know their Women, never tru&s;t them out of their
&s;ight. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible to give any rea&s;on of &s;o great a
Difference between the Ancient Romans, and the
Modern Italians but only Luxury, and the Reigning
Luxury of <HI>Modern Italy,</HI> is that &s;oft and effeminate
Mu&s;ick which abounds in the <HI>Italian Opera.</HI> And
if Mu&s;ick of the &s;ame Nature has not as yet had the
<PB REF="7">
&s;ame Influence on <HI>France,</HI> it is becau&s;e the French
Mu&s;ick is by no means &s;o meltingly moving as the
Italian, and that the effect of the Charm has been in
&s;ome mea&s;ure retarded by the whole Nation's having
been in Arms for &s;o many Tears together.</P>
<P>There is one Ob&s;ervation which naturally occurs
here, and with which we &s;hall conclude this Pre|face;
and that is, that the Alterations which have
been made in the Entertainment of the Stage for the&s;e
la&s;t Ten Years, &s;eem to have had &s;ome influence
ev'n upon common Society. For as Sen&s;e upon the
Stage &s;eems to have given place to Sound, the &s;ame
thing appears to have happen'd in familiar Conver&s;a|tion,
which is reduc'd to &s;uch a Level among all &s;orts
of People, as perhaps never was known in the World
before. For go where you will, either among Citts
or Courtiers, among Men of Sen&s;e or Blockheads, the
Conver&s;ation rolls mo&s;t upon Two Points, which are
News and Toa&s;ting. Now this is certain, that a
very &s;olemn dull Fool makes a very pretty News|monger;
and a very empty, errant Coxcomb, a very
accompli&s;h'd Toa&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>E&s;&s;ay on the Opera's.</HEAD>
<P>THere appears to have been of late Years, a Com|bination
of all &s;orts of People, to &s;et up Opera's,
and Entertainments of Singing and Dancing
in the room of Dramatick Poems. At a time
when we are contending with our Enemies for our ve|ry
Being; we are aukwardly Aping their Luxuries and
their Vices, which we neglected or contemn'd while
we were at full Peace with them; as if by a certain
foreboding Delu&s;ion we were preparing our &s;elves for
Slavery, and endeavouring to make our &s;elves agreeable
to our new Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>But that &s;o many People of great Quality, and of
greater Parts, Lovers of their Country, and Encoura|gers
of Art, and of Poetry more particularly, &s;hould
prove &s;o zealous in the encouraging and promoting
Entertainments, which tend &s;o directly to the Detri|ment
of the Publick, to the Detriment of Arts, and
e&s;pecially of expiring Poetry; Entertainments which
are &s;o directly contrary to their Nobler Plea&s;ures, and
their real Intere&s;ts, can proceed from nothing but from
that Weight of Affairs which oppre&s;&s;es them, and de|prives
them of time and lei&s;ure to con&s;ider deliberate|ly
of the&s;e things.</P>
<P>There is no Man living, who has either a higher
e&s;teem than my &s;elf for their natural and acquir'd En|dowments,
or a greater Veneration for their re&s;tle&s;s
Endeavours to promote the real good of their Country
<PB N="2" REF="9">
in all other things. And I depend upon tho&s;e great
Qualities, upon their exqui&s;ite Di&s;cernment, their exact
Ju&s;tice, and their magnanimous Spirit of Liberty, when
I pre&s;ume to oppo&s;e a popular and prevailing Caprice, and
to defend the Engli&s;h Stage, which together with our
Engli&s;h Liberties has de&s;cended to us from our Ance|&s;tors,
to defend it again&s;t that Deluge of Mortal Foes,
which have come pouring in from the Continent, to
drive out the Mu&s;es, its Old Inhabitants, and &s;eat
them&s;elves in their &s;tead; that while the Engli&s;h Arms
are every where Victorious abroad, the Engli&s;h Arts
may not be vanqui&s;h'd and oppre&s;s'd at home by the In|va&s;ion
of Foreign Luxury.</P>
<P>There is no Man living who is more convinc'd than
my &s;elf of the Power of Harmony, or more penetra|ted
by the Charms of Mu&s;ick. I know very well that
Mu&s;ick makes a con&s;iderable Part both of Eloquence
and of Poetry; and therefore to endeavour to decry it
fully, would be as well a fooli&s;h, as an ungrateful
Task, &s;ince the very efforts which we &s;hould make
again&s;t it, would only &s;erve to declare its Excellence,
it being impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ucceed in them, but by &s;upplies
which we &s;hould borrow from its own Harmony. Mu|&s;ick
may be made profitable as well as delightful, if it
is &s;ubordinate to &s;ome nobler Art, and &s;ub&s;ervient to
Rea&s;on; but if it pre&s;umes not only to degenerate
from its ancient Severity, from its &s;acred Solemnity,
but to &s;et up for it&s;elf, and to grow independant, as it
does in our late Opera's, it becomes a meer &s;en&s;ual
Delight, utterly incapable of informing the Under|&s;anding,
or of reforming the Will; and for that very
Rea&s;on utterly unfit to be made a publick Diversion$
and then the more charming it grows, it becomes the
more pernicious. Since when it is once habitual, $word$
<PB N="3" REF="10">
mu&s;t &s;o far debauch the Minds of Men, as to make them
incapable of tho&s;e rea&s;onable Diver&s;ions, which have
got the ju&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Stage.</P>
<P>Thus unle&s;s we u&s;e timely Prevention, the Briti&s;h
Mu&s;e is like to meet with the &s;ame Fate that <HI>Tithonus</HI>
is &s;aid to have done of old, who had no other Fruit of
his Immortality, than to &s;ee him&s;elf depriv'd by the
length of Days, of all his Strength, his Spirit, and his
Tow'ring Thoughts, and eaten and con&s;um'd by the
Jaws of Time, till nothing remain'd of him but an
empty Voice.</P>
<P>'Tis undeniable, that in whatever Countries Opera's
have been e&s;tabli&s;h'd after the manner of <HI>Italy,</HI> they
have driven out Poetry from among that People. 'Tis
now more than a Hundred Years &s;ince the very &s;pecies
of Poets has di&s;appear'd in <HI>Italy;</HI> and at pre&s;ent there
is not &s;o much as one Poet in &s;o va&s;t a Kingdom as
<HI>France,</HI> allowing <HI>Boileau</HI> to be &s;uperannuated.</P>
<P>In the beginning of this War, we were perhaps the
only People in <HI>Europe,</HI> who could ju&s;tly boa&s;t of Free|dom
or of Poetry. We have indeed very bravely de|fended
our Liberties, but we have at the &s;ame time
abandon'd our Poetry to the very Nations who have
attack'd the other, and by I know not what Whim&s;ey
of Fate, while in the Field we have been knocking
their braved Men on the Head, we have been care&s;|&s;ing
and hugging the Off-&s;cowring of them at home.</P>
<P>That Poetry is like from the Progre&s;s of Mu&s;ick, to
have the &s;ame Fate in <HI>England,</HI> that it met with in
<HI>France</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> we have very good rea&s;on to believe,
when we con&s;ider that of late Years, they who have
had &s;ome Talent for writing, have, for the mo&s;t part,
&s;till writ wor&s;e and wor&s;e, and when that which has
been well writ, has been wor&s;e received by our Au|diences;
<PB N="4" REF="11">
when tho&s;e Audiences will hardly &s;uffer a Play,
that is not interlarded with Singing and Dancing,
whereas the&s;e are become Theatrical Entertainments,
without any thing of the Drama, when our People of
Quality utterly neglecting Engli&s;h Comedy and Trage|dy,
give &s;uch Encouragement to Italian Mu&s;ick, that if
they gave but the like to the proper Entertainments
of the Stage, the Engli&s;h would infallibly excell both
Ancients and Moderns.</P>
<P>That this Alteration in the Writers and Audiences
is to be a&s;crib'd to the Progre&s;s of Mu&s;ick, rather than
attributed to any unknown Cau&s;e, or imputed to Fan|cy,
or the Incon&s;tancy of the People, we &s;hall now
very clearly &s;hew.</P>
<P>Man is &s;o very Fanta&s;tical a Creature, that perhaps
he owes his be&s;t and his worthie&s;t Actions to what may
be properly called his Weakne&s;s, that is, to his Vanity,
or his Love of Glory. For tho' that depends upon an
Opinion of Excellence, which is almo&s;t always fal&s;e,
and is therefore truly a Weakne&s;s, yet it gives the Mind
a Force, an Elevation and an Enthu&s;ia&s;m, which it has
not without it, and which make it capable of quite other
things than it was before. Now the greater the Action
is that any one de&s;igns, the more is requir'd of &s;o impe|tuous
a Motive to execute it; but the writing a Tragedy,
or an Epick Poem, being perhaps the greate&s;t thing that
a Man can de&s;ign, and it being impo&s;&s;ible to &s;ucceed in
Poetry without Enthu&s;ia&s;m, the Epick, the Tragick,
and indeed all Poets who a&s;pire to the greater Poetry,
have occa&s;ion for &s;o enthu&s;ia&s;tick a Motive as the Love of
Glory; if they write with any other view than to be
prai&s;ed, than to be admired, they mu&s;t certainly write
contemptibly, nay, they ought to propo&s;e to them&s;elves
to rai&s;e their Reputations equal to the fir&s;t of Men, to
<PB N="5" REF="12">
place them&s;elves among the Benefactors of Mankind,
and rank their Glory with the deathle&s;s Fame of the
Heroes whom they celebrate. But that this Vanity may
be nouri&s;h'd and &s;upported in them, they mu&s;t actually
find them&s;elves prais'd by the be&s;t of Men, and meet with
an Admiration equal to the Idea which they conceive of
their Labours. But if either that Prai&s;e is wanting, or
if it is &s;har'd by the Profe&s;&s;ors of inferior or illiberate
Arts; if upon the very Stage the Capital of the Mu&s;es
<HI>Dominion,</HI> and the Poets <HI>Domain,</HI> not only Compo&s;ers, but
ev'n Singers and Dancers, meet with greater Applau&s;e,
and greater Encouragement, what wonder if their
Pride is immediately mortify'd, and their Fire extin|gui&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Thus Mu&s;ick has caus'd &s;o great a Change in our Wri|ters,
becau&s;e it has wrought &s;o great a one in our Au|diences,
and it will certainly work a greater in both if it
goes on Triumphantly; for the generality of our Au|diences
are far more capable of a Plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e than
of a Delight of Rea&s;on. Now Mu&s;ick that is not &s;ub|&s;ervient
to Rea&s;on, e&s;pecially if it be &s;oft and effeminate,
is a meer Delight of Sen&s;e; and as &s;ome body has ob|&s;erv'd
that Friend&s;hip grows in&s;ipid to tho&s;e who have
ta&s;ted of Love, it grows exceeding difficult, ev'n for tho&s;e
who are capable of the &s;evere Delights of Rea&s;on to make
a plea&s;ing Return to them, if they have at any time
left them for the bewitching Plea&s;ure of Sen&s;e. Man
naturally pur&s;ues Plea&s;ure and flies from Pain, and en|deavours
to be happy at as little Expence as he can, and
therefore the Delights of Sen&s;e are preferred to rea&s;ona|ble
Plea&s;ures, becau&s;e the Soul takes in the fir&s;t without
any effort, but the la&s;t require &s;evere Preparation, or at
the lea&s;t Attention. In &s;hort, if 'tis &s;o hard to part
with &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;urer, after they are once become ha|bitual,
<PB N="6" REF="13">
tho' all a Man's Intere&s;t and his whole Reputation
require it, how much more difficult mu&s;t it be, when
the&s;e two powerful Motives are wanting.</P>
<P>Perhaps too the Pride and Vanity that is in Mankind,
may determine the generality to give into Mu&s;ick at
the expence of Poetry. Men love to enjoy their Plea|&s;ures
entirely, and not to have them re&s;train'd by Awe,
or curb'd by Mortification. Now there are but few
judicious Spectators at our Dramatick Repre&s;entations,
&s;ince none can be &s;o, but who with great Endowments
of Nature have had a very generous Education, and the
re&s;t are frequently mortify'd by pa&s;&s;ing fooli&s;h Judg|ments;
but in Mu&s;ick the Ca&s;e is va&s;tly different, to
judge of that requires only U&s;e and a fine Ear, which
the Footman often has a great deal finer than his Ma|&s;ter.
In &s;hort, a Man without common Sen&s;e may very
well judge of what a Man writes without common Sen&s;e,
and without common Sen&s;e compo&s;es.</P>
<P>Since then we have made it appear &s;o plainly, that
by introducing Entertainments of meer Mu&s;ick among
us, we mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity bani&s;h Poetry; let us now en|quire
of what con&s;equence the doing that mu&s;t be to
the Reputation and the Intere&s;t of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>Now the Intere&s;t and Reputation of any Nation con|&s;i&s;ts
in Power, as Power con&s;i&s;ts in the Wi&s;dom, Num|bers,
and Spirit of the People, but the chiefe&s;t of the&s;e
i$ the Spirit, &s;ince that is capable of making the other
two, but without that the other two are of no &s;igni|ficancy.</P>
<P>Now publick Spirit includes two things, Zeal and
Affection, for the Honour and Intere&s;t of ones Coun|try,
and Courage and Re&s;olution to put any thing in
Practice that may promote its Service or Glory.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="14">
Now if we can &s;hew that Poetry augments this Spi|rit
where-ever it finds it, and &s;ometimes begets it where
it was not before, and that meer Mu&s;ick, &s;uch as is that
of our Opera's, is &s;o far from begetting this Spirit where
it was not before, or from augmenting it where it meets
with it, that it has a natural tendency to the dimini&s;hing
it, and de&s;troying it, then I hope it will be readily gran|ted,
that &s;ince publick Entertainments of meer Mu&s;ick
and Poetry are incompatible, and that we mu&s;t bani&s;h
one and retain the other, it will be rea&s;onable to bani&s;h
the Opera and not Poetry.</P>
<P>If the Entertainment which we have from our Opera's
is a meer &s;en&s;ual Plea&s;ure, which &s;ays nothing either to
enlighten the Under&s;tanding or to convert the Will, it
is impo&s;&s;ible to conceive, how it can either rai&s;e the Pa&s;|&s;ions
to correct them, or infu&s;e generous &s;entiments into
the Soul, to exalt and confirm the Rea&s;on, or to in&s;pire
publick Spirit, and publick Virtue, and elevated notions
of Liberty.</P>
<P>It belongs to Poetry only, to teach publick Virtue
and publick Spirit, and a noble contempt of Death,
with an Expre&s;&s;ion and with an Air becoming of its
God-like Notions. That alone can worthily tell Man|kind
that we were not born for our &s;elves; that we
were fram'd and contriv'd for Society by an All-wi&s;e
Maker; and that the greate&s;t of Men are Mi&s;erable if
they are long in Solitude. That &s;o great is the &s;ym|pathy
of Souls, that it is impo&s;&s;ible for a thinking Man
to be Happy, but in the common Felicity of his Fellow
Creatures; that He who never did any thing to pro|mote
that, never felt perfect Plea&s;ure; that Man has
infinitely more Plea&s;ure, ev'n of Sen&s;e, from tho&s;e acts
by which he maintains his Species, than he has from
tho&s;e by which he pre&s;erves him&s;elf. What Raptures
<PB N="8" REF="15">
of mind mu&s;t tho&s;e Heroes feel, who&s;e Virtue has been
the pre&s;erver of Nations, and made a World Happy?
That great Minds bravely contemn Death to further that
Felicity; that Fate is unavoidable to Mankind, and that
Thirty, Forty, Fifty Years is &s;o very much nothing
in the view of a comprehen&s;ive Soul, that a Hero mu&s;t
e&s;teem it wi&s;er as well as nobler, rather than langui&s;h|ingly
to expect Death, to go out and meet him for the
publick good, and &s;o to make a &s;ublime Virtue ev'n of
the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity: That what we call Life here is not pro|perly
the Hero's Life, that almo&s;t half of it is pa&s;s'd in
ab&s;olute Death, and the re&s;t in De&s;ire, in Grief, in Love,
in Rage, in Pain. And that the bright and eternal
Fame, to which great Minds a&s;pire, is never fully attain'd
to here; that the Names of the greate&s;t Heroes are cir|cum&s;crib'd
by narrow bounds both of time and &s;pace;
and that their be&s;t and their brave&s;t Actions, are mi&s;taken
and mi&s;interpreted by &s;ome, ev'n of tho&s;e who have the
fortune to hear of them, that they are traduced by others
envyed by more, that that is properly the Hero's Life,
when &s;et free from the&s;e mortal Bonds, he &s;hall arrive at
that bli&s;sful Man&s;ion which is on purpo&s;e prepar'd for
tho&s;e illu&s;trious Souls, who by making it their bu&s;ine&s;s
here below to do good to their Country and Mankind,
have practis'd the noble&s;t and mo&s;t exten&s;ive Charity that
divine&s;t Poets can teach or God Him&s;elf can in&s;pire; that
there they &s;hall enjoy a Life, which &s;hall be for ever &s;et
free from Death, there their Happine&s;s &s;hall far &s;urpa&s;s
ev'n what the Heart of Man can conceive, and their
Glory tran&s;cend ev'n their own a&s;piring Wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>The&s;e Godlike Sentiments exalted Poetry in&s;tills into
Mankind, and by infu&s;ing the&s;e in&s;pires us with a Zeal
and Affection for our Country's Service, and with a ge|nerous
contempt of Death in time of the publick Dan|ger.
<PB N="9" REF="16">
And as there is no other principle of humane
Action but Sentiment, it is wholly impo&s;&s;ible but that a
People habituated to the&s;e Heroick Notions mu&s;t be pre|par'd
and form'd for the performing Heroick Actions.</P>
<P>The&s;e un&s;peakable advantages has lofty Poetry over
empty &s;ounds, and harmonious trifles, which, as the
plea&s;ure that they give us is a &s;en&s;ual Delight, utterly in|dependant
of Rea&s;on, mu&s;t do &s;omething directly oppo&s;ite
to this, &s;ince 'tis natural to &s;en&s;e to bring a Man home to
him&s;elf, and confine him there, as 'tis natural to Rea&s;on
to expand the Soul, if I may have leave to u&s;e the expre&s;|&s;ion,
and throw it out upon the Publick: And as &s;oft and
delicious Mu&s;ick by &s;oothing the Sen&s;es, and making a
Man too much in Love with him&s;elf, makes him too lit|tle
fond of the publick, &s;o by ema&s;culating and di&s;&s;olving
the mind, it &s;hakes the very foundation of Fortitude,
and &s;o is de&s;tructive of both branches of the publick
Spirit.</P>
<P>But if any one objects that an Opera may be &s;o con|triv'd
and Writ, as to in&s;pire us with an affection for the
Publick, and with a generous contempt of Death; to
him I an&s;wer, that an Opera &s;o de&s;ign'd, mu&s;t be writ
with force or without it. If 'tis writ with force 'tis in|compatible
with Mu&s;ick, e&s;pecially in &s;o ma&s;culine a Lan|guage
as ours; for force in our Language cannot be ex|pre&s;t
without a great many Con&s;onants, and Words that
terminate in Con&s;onants, but a great many Con&s;onants
and e&s;pecially Con&s;onants terminating Words, cannot be
pronounced without very frequently &s;hutting the mouth,
which is diametrically oppo&s;ite to the expre&s;&s;ing of Mu|&s;ick.</P>
<P>But if an Opera &s;o de&s;ign'd is not writ with force, I
leave it to any one to judge, whether the weakne&s;s of the
expre&s;&s;ion and of the &s;entiments, are like to make Im|pre&s;&s;ion
<PB N="10" REF="17">
enough to work any change in the Souls of an
Audience; or if they are not like to be wholly lo&s;t in the
&s;oftne&s;s of lu&s;cious &s;ounds; or if the mind is fit to attend
to its duty, while the whole Man is di&s;&s;olv'd in the wan|tonne&s;s
of effeminate Airs.</P>
<P>After what has been &s;aid, I appeal to any Lover of his
Country, if Poetry which begets a publick Spirit, ought
to be bani&s;h'd for Mu&s;ick which de&s;troys it, which as it
corrupts Mankind has a natural tendency to the In&s;laving
them; and indeed where-ever Opera's have been a con|&s;tant
Entertainment they have been attended with &s;lave|ry.
We are at pre&s;ent contending for Liberty, and hard
is the Contention, and the event doubtful, and we can|not
&s;o much as hope to &s;ucceed, but by the Virtue of that
magnanimous Spirit, which Poetry exalts, and which
effeminate Mu&s;ick deba&s;es.</P>
<P>I know not by what Fate it has happen'd, that when
in &s;ome late Reigns, in which Arbitrary Pow'r was the
thing that was aim'd at, the Stage the Protector of Liber|ty
was chiefly encourag'd, in a Reign like this which De|&s;igns
and Breaths forth nothing but Liberty; Plea&s;ures
&s;hould be encourag'd ev'n by Lovers of Liberty,
which are Independant of Rea&s;on, and tend to nothing
but Slavery. A long experience has told us, that what
My Lord <HI>Ro&s;common</HI> has &s;aid in his E&s;&s;ay on translated
Ver&s;e is true.</P>
<Q><L>True Poets are the Guardians of a State,</L>
<L>And when they fail portend approaching Fate.</L>
<L>For that which <HI>Rome</HI> to Conque&s;t did in&s;pire,</L>
<L>Was not the Ve&s;tal but the Mu&s;es Fire;</L>
<L>Heav'n Joyns the Ble&s;&s;ings, no declining Age</L>
<L>E're felt the Raptures of Poetick Rage.</L></Q>
<P>The Declen&s;ion of Poetry in <HI>Greece</HI> and Ancient <HI>Rome</HI>
was &s;oon follow'd by that of Liberty and Empire. And
<PB N="11" REF="18">
the very Spirit of Prophe&s;ie, which was the Spirit of He|brew
Poetry, departing from the Jews in the Babyloni&s;h
Captivity, was a fatal Omen that Liberty and Empire
were never to flouri&s;h more with them.</P>
<P>That the Declen&s;ion of Poetry &s;hould portend the fall
of Empire is not without very good Rea&s;on. Becau&s;e it
&s;hews a &s;lackning of the publick Spirit, and an increa&s;e
of univer&s;al Corruption, which prepares the Fate of
Empires, as a &s;preading mortification fore-runs the Fate
of Men. If a Poet is not admir'd, tho' the Man may
live, the Spirit of the Poet dies, but a People to admire
tho&s;e generous Sentiments which abound in Poetry, mu&s;t
at lea&s;t have &s;omething in them that an&s;wers to them:
If they once grow wholly immer&s;t and &s;unk in Plea&s;ures
of &s;en&s;e, tho&s;e elevated Notions appear as &s;o many Li|bels
upon them, and their &s;ickly Souls either turn away
from them, or very feebly an&s;wer to them. In &s;hort,
where-ever there is either the Love of Liberty or the Love
of Glory, a true Poet may well be admir'd, and in how
wretched a condition mu&s;t the Nation be where both
tho&s;e Qualities are wanting. From what has been &s;aid
'tis manife&s;t that it behoves us to think, before we fully
re&s;olve upon bani&s;hing &s;o u&s;eful an Entertainment as that
of the <HI>Drama,</HI> for the pernicious Amu&s;ement of Opera's.</P>
<P>The <HI>Drama</HI> was e&s;tabli&s;h'd here in <HI>England</HI> at the &s;ame
time with Reformation and Liberty: For the <HI>Drama</HI> was
&s;et up in the Reign of Qu. <HI>Elizabeth,</HI> in who&s;e Reign the
Reformation was fully e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and before which the
People of <HI>England,</HI> for Rea&s;ons too long to be In&s;erted
here, could hardly be &s;aid to be entirely free. As the
<HI>Drama</HI> came in with them, it has flouri&s;h'd with them,
and gone a good way towards the &s;upporting that Spirit
of Liberty on which the Reformation depends. It would
here be ea&s;ie to make an odd Remark, and that is, that
<PB N="12" REF="19">
the <HI>Drama</HI> had never like to have fall'n, but that and Li|berty
&s;tumbled almo&s;t together.</P>
<P>In the time of the late Civil Wars, when the Bigo|try
of Hypocritical Zeal had once &s;uppre&s;s'd our Theatres,
a Military Government &s;oon follow'd, which is the
wor&s;t or Slaveries.</P>
<P>And when in the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI> II, upon the
breaking out of the Popi&s;h Plot, the Theatres were both
abandon'd, it was not long before all the Charters were
&s;urrender'd.</P>
<P>And yet tho' the Reformation and Liberty and the
Drama were e&s;tabli&s;h'd among us together, and have
flouri&s;h'd among us together, and have &s;till been like
to have fall'n together; notwith&s;tanding all this, at this
pre&s;ent Juncture, when Liberty, and the Reformation
are in the utmo&s;t Danger, we are going very bravely to
oppre&s;s the Drama, in order to e&s;tabli&s;h the luxurious
Diver&s;ions of tho&s;e very Nations, from who&s;e Attempts
and De&s;igns both Liberty and the Reformation are in
the utmo&s;t Danger.</P>
<P>That &s;o unhappy a Change will be as little conducive
to the Glory of <HI>England,</HI> as it will be to its Intere&s;t, is
not in the lea&s;t to be doubted; for what mu&s;t tho&s;e
Strangers &s;ay who arrive among us, if they have any
ta&s;te, when they behold a People &s;o lofty, &s;o fierce,
and formerly &s;o famous for their Contempt of Foreign
Manners, forgetting their old Pride to &s;o &s;trange a de|gree,
that very Pride by which they have &s;o long main|tain'd
their Liberties, to imitate the prodigious Luxury
of <HI>Italy</HI> with an awkward and vile Imitation, and &s;ome
Men of the greate&s;t Parts in the Kingdom, applauding
and encouraging that vile Imitation with all their In|du&s;try
and all their Diligence, and in order to that di&s;|$ountenancing
in&s;tructive Comedy, in which the En|gli&s;h
<PB N="13" REF="20">
excel Mankind, and neglecting the mo&s;t noble and
mo&s;t beneficial of all Entertainments, Tragedy; in
which Nature has qualify'd us to excel all the Moderns.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t tho&s;e Strangers &s;ay, when they behold
Engli&s;hmen applaud an Italian for Singing, or a French|man
for Dancing, and the very Moment afterwards ex|plode
an Engli&s;hman for the very &s;ame things? What
mu&s;t they &s;ay, unle&s;s they have Candour enough to in|terpret
it this way, that an Englishman is de&s;ervedly
&s;corned by Engli&s;hmen, when he de&s;cends &s;o far be|neath
him&s;elf, as to Sing or to Dance in publick, be|cau&s;e
by doing &s;o he practi&s;es Arts which Nature has
be&s;tow'd upon effeminate Nations, but denied to him,
as below the Dignity of his Country, and the Maje&s;ty
of the Briti&s;h Genius.</P>
<P>What mu&s;t tho&s;e Strangers &s;ay, when they &s;ee that
we leave &s;o rea&s;onable and &s;o in&s;tructive an Entertain|ment
as Tragedy, for one &s;o pernicious and &s;o extreme|ly
ab&s;urd; for there is &s;omething in the Italian Opera,
which is Barbarous and Gothick, and &s;o contrary to a
true Ta&s;te, that an Opera in any Country can be only
advanc'd by the &s;ame Degrees that the Ta&s;te of Men is
debauch'd for more generous Arts. Thus in <HI>Italy,</HI>
where an Opera is mo&s;t advanc'd, there is no one who
can write either Ver&s;e or Pro&s;e, nor any one who can
judge of them. For when once the Italians were fal'n
&s;o low, as to prefer Sound to Sen&s;e, they quickly grew
to write &s;uch Sen&s;e that Sound de&s;erv'd to be preferr'd
to it.</P>
<P>If that is truly the mo&s;t Gothick, which is the mo&s;t
oppos'd to Antick, nothing can be more Gothick than
an Opera, &s;ince nothing can be more oppos'd to the an|cient
Tragedy, than the modern Tragedy in Mu&s;ick,
becau&s;e the one is rea&s;onable, the other ridiculous;
<PB N="14" REF="21">
the one is artful, the other ab&s;urd; the one beneficial,
the other pernicious; in &s;hort, the one natural, and the
other mon&s;trous. And the modern Tragedy in Mu&s;ick,
is as much oppos'd to the Chorus, which is the Mu&s;i|cal
part of the Ancient Tragedy, as it is to the <HI>Epi&s;odique;</HI>
becau&s;e in the Chorus the Mu&s;ick is always great and
&s;olemn, in the Opera 'tis often mo&s;t trifling and mo&s;t
effeminate; in the Chorus the Mu&s;ick is only for the &s;ake
of the Sen&s;e, in the Opera the Sen&s;e is mo&s;t apparently
for the &s;ake of the Mu&s;ick.</P>
<P>When I affirm that an Opera after the Italian Man|ner
is mon&s;trous, I cannot think that I deal too &s;everely
with it; no not tho' I add, that it is &s;o prodigiou&s;ly
unnatural, that it could take its beginning from no
Country, but that which is renowned throughout the
World, for preferring mon&s;trous abominable Plea&s;ures
to tho&s;e which are according to Nature.</P>
<P>But yet this mu&s;t be allow'd, that tho' the Opera in
<HI>Italy</HI> is a Mon&s;ter, 'tis a beautiful harmonious Mon&s;ter,
but here in <HI>England</HI> 'tis an ugly howling one. What
then mu&s;t not only Strangers, but we our &s;elves &s;ay,
with all our Partiality to our &s;elves, when we con&s;ider
that we not only leave a reasonable Entertainment for
a ridiculous one, an artful one for an ab&s;urd one, a be|neficial
one for a de&s;tructive one, and a very natural
one for one that is very mon&s;trous; but that we for|&s;ake
a mo&s;t noble Art, for &s;ucceeding in which we are
perhaps the be&s;t qualify'd of any Peeple in <HI>Europe,</HI> for a
very vile one for which Heaven and Nature have not
at all de&s;ign'd us, as having given us, neither Ears, nor
Voices, nor Languages, nor Climate proper to it. <HI>En|gland</HI>
may certainly with a little Encouragement pro|duce
the greate&s;t Tragick Poets in <HI>Europe,</HI> but there is
&s;carce one Nation in the Chri&s;tian World, but is quali|fy'd
<PB N="15" REF="22">
to &s;urpa&s;s us in Opera's, &s;ince they are almo&s;t all &s;ci|tuated
under a &s;erener Sky.</P>
<P>If a private Man who mi&s;takes his Talent, and applies
him&s;elf to things, for which neither God nor Nature
have qualify'd him, does by that very choice deface all
his good Qualities, and render him&s;elf contemptible to
the World, how much more dishonourable mu&s;t it be
for a whole Nation?</P>
<P>As all Kingdoms that are in different Latitudes, have
Plants with very different Properties, &s;o have they Na|tives
with very different Talents. If any Yeoman of
<HI>Kent</HI> or <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> &s;hould neglect to &s;ow his Wheat or his
Barley, &s;hould grub up his Fruit Trees, and demoli&s;h
his Hop Grounds, and fall a planting the Olive of Lucca,
the Orange of Naples, and the Mu&s;catello of Monte-Fia&s;cone,
or of Mont-Alchin; what would his Neigh|bours
think of &s;uch a Proceeding? And yet that Per&s;on
would plainly a&s;pire in his choice. What then, mu&s;t
not the French and Italians think of us, who de&s;pi&s;e the
mo&s;t generous Productions of our own Minds, and indeed
of the Mind of Man, for the vile&s;t of theirs of which we
are not capable. Let us take heed, that as we have ta|ken
the Opera from the Nations which we de&s;pi&s;e, it
renders us not contemptible to tho&s;e very Nations.</P>

<P>SInce the Printing of this E&s;&s;ay, I have been inform'd
by very good Hands, that a young Lady of the
fir&s;t Quality, equally famous for her Beauty, her Spirit,
and her Virtue, did lately to the Glory of her own Sex,
and the Shame of ours, give very &s;trict Order, that
the <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> of <HI>Shake&s;pear,</HI> which was acted at her
Reque&s;t, &s;hould be done without any Performance ei|ther
of Singing or Dancing. Which Order has &s;hewn
that &s;he is as much di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Beauty of her
Mind, as by that of her Per&s;on; and as every Grace
has been always a con&s;tant Attendant on her, 'tis be|come
the Duty of every Mu&s;e to wait on her, and to
return her Thanks for making way by her illu&s;trious
Example, for the delivering Engli&s;h Poetry from the
Oppre&s;&s;ion of Foreign Luxury, as every Engli&s;hman is
bound to extol the Heroe from whom &s;he &s;prung, for

Emulation in her Sex, and a ju&s;t Confu&s;ion in ours.
May &s;he be follow'd by every fair one, as <HI>Venus</HI> is by
