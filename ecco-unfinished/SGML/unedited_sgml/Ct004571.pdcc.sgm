<HEAD>CONTENTS.</HEAD>
<LIST>
<ITEM><HI>Ver. 1.</HI> Introduction. Addre&s;s. The earlie&s;t Ages knew nothing of Ridicule. The Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of it. The pre&s;ent Age extremely addicted to it. Tho&s;e mo&s;t &s;o who have no great Talents of their own. Ill Effects of it, in Religion, in common Life.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ver. 87.</HI> The Pretence on which our Fondne&s;s for Ridicule is founded, <HI>i. e.</HI> its being the Te&s;t of Truth. It is not the Te&s;t of Truth. There is nothing but what may be &s;o di&s;gui&s;ed as to appear ridiculous. Examples of &s;everal Kinds.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ver. 163.</HI> Ridicule on the Sciences con&s;idered. A Fondne&s;s for a particular Science and Ignorance of the re&s;t generally the Cau&s;es of it. All Arts u&s;eful, and therefore not to be ridiculed. Even ju&s;t Ridicule on the Sciences attended with ill Effects.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ver. 215.</HI> Ridicule in common Life. To be handled cautiou&s;ly. Per&s;onal Defects not the Object of it. Vice above Ridicule, and the Danger of laughing at it. The good Succe&s;s of the middle Comedy. Made u&s;e of to ill Purpo&s;es, and de&s;pi&s;ed. The new Comedy imitated by our Poets. The &s;mall Effects it has; the ill Effects it may have in making Men Hypocrites. Virtues and Vices &s;ometimes &s;o blended, that the one cannot be laughed at without injuring the other. Example.</ITEM>
<ITEM><HI>Ver. 334.</HI> Affectation the allowed Object of Ridicule. Tho&s;e mo&s;t Ridiculous who affect Follies and Vices. Affectations often found among great Virtues. To be repre&s;s'd however, but with Good-nature Goodnature the only thing that can make Ridicule u&s;e|ful. Recommended to the Satiri&s;ts. Conclu&s;ion.</ITEM>
