</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Sir Cha.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why this comes now of Intriguing in <HI>Spain&mdash;</HI>A Man can't carry on an Amour, but he mu&s;t cut the Throat of &s;ome jealous Coxcomb or other to Cure him of his Impertinence&mdash;But what other News?

<P>I am afraid Madam, that he knows &s;ome of your Haunts, and therefore I'd advi&s;e you to be Cautious.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis hard that a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Woman can't have an Amour, but &s;ome jealous pated Father, or Brother mu&s;t interfere with the Honour of his Fa|mily: Now I have heard, that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Women may take what Diver&s;ion they plea&s;e, and be ra|ther Celebrated for their Beauty, than Cen&s;ur'd.&mdash;Nay, that the very Wives may have a whole Equipage of Lovers, and be the more admir'd by their Husbands.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Flo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis the Nature of the Climate, Madam, as in <HI>France</HI> the Coquet is rather Admired for her Airs, then Cen&s;ur'd for her Inclinations. Not but there's detraction in both Climates, but there 'tis a plea&s;ure peculiar to the Women, where
<PB N="10" REF="150">
Scandal pa&s;&s;es for Wit, and one Beauty ri&s;es on the falling Reputation of another. The Men un|le&s;s the Beaus, having nothing to do with it; and tho&s;e no farther, then a little Raillery for their Diver&s;ion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>I cou'd be as free as they had I the Power&mdash;For I have cho&s;e a Per&s;on of my own Liking, and my Father has Contracted me to one that is indifferent to me. Now methinks there's &s;uch a plea&s;ure in the Di&s;obedience, that it adds an Elo|quence to the Suit of a Lover.</P>

<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis want of Courage in our Lovers to put a good Cu&s;tom in practice, otherwi&s;e the Jealous fury of a <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Don might in time be moderated to the Content of a <HI>London</HI> Citizen.</P>

<P>Oh what a hideous Compari&s;on have you made! the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Cavalier! Is he not all that a Woman can wi&s;h for? A Man of Gallantry&mdash;Beautiful in his Per&s;on, and agreeable in his Con|ver&s;ation? are not all the Per&s;wa&s;ive Charms of Wit upon his Tongue?

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Leo.</SPEAKER>
<P>Aye, but then he is to be my Husband, <HI>Flora;</HI> and the Pro&s;pect of a forc'd Marriage E|clip&s;es the Worth of a Suitor&mdash;Be&s;ides my Mo|ther was an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Woman&mdash;Therefore I am of &s;o Gay a Temper, and &s;o naturally Fond of Li|berty,
