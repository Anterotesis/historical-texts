<P>I Cannot commit this Tragedy to the pre&s;s without availing my&s;elf of the opportu|nity to acknowledge the &s;upport you gave it on the &s;tge. I felt my&s;elf under the weight of a re&s;pon&s;ibility during its trial before the Public, which made tho&s;e moments extremely anxious; for had I been adjudged guilty of mi&s;employing your talents, I mu&s;t have &s;unk under the &s;entence without appeal, con&s;cious of having conceived the fable, and addre&s;&s;ed every feature and expre&s;&s;ion of the prevailing character profe&s;&s;edly to you: in &s;hort there was no po&s;&s;ible &s;helter for &s;elf-prejudice (had that been among&s;t my failings) to re&s;ort to, where all the Performers &s;tood &s;o ably in the &s;cene, and where the &s;pectacle was &s;o fully
<PB N="iv" REF="3">
furni&s;hed by the liberality of the Proprietors, that I can hone&s;tly declare my endeavours, antecedent to the exhibition, had not been employed to urge their &s;pirit to expence, but on the contrary to re&s;train it.</P>
<P>I am deeply grateful to a generous and can|did Audience for their reception of this Tra|gedy; and though I am not to learn how much of their applau&s;e re&s;ts per&s;onally with you and your a&s;&s;ociates in the ca&s;t, I am no le&s;s penetrated with a &s;en&s;e of the favours I am to transfer to others, than of tho&s;e which I may be permitted to retain to my&s;elf.</P>
<P>The character of our Drama in its be&s;t ex|amples is &s;o clo&s;e to Nature, that you, Madam, who are apt to give &s;o perfect a reflection of her image, &s;eem born for the elevation of the Briti&s;h &s;tage. The Author, who &s;hall write for you, mu&s;t copy from no other model but Nature; every thing mu&s;t be addre&s;&s;ed to the &s;pectator's heart, and of cour&s;e mu&s;t flow from his own; artificial &s;ituations, tricking inci|dents and &s;tudied declamations, mu&s;t be thrown a&s;ide where you are to appear; it will not be his aim to make you loquacious
<PB N="v" REF="4">
in the &s;cene, becau&s;e he has &s;uch fine recita|tion to re&s;ort to, nor will he call you out into &s;tarts and attitudes, merely becau&s;e he has a form &s;o &s;triking to di&s;play at his command; glittering pa&s;&s;ages and traps for plaudits will be beneath his attention; he will lead &s;im|plicity in his hand, and keep &s;ublimity in his eye.</P>
<P>To &s;uch a Poet may I now con&s;ign you!&mdash;Yet before I make over &s;o valuable a convey|ance, let me appri&s;e him of the extent of his good fortune; and that it is not only in the public repre&s;entation of his &s;cenes where he will find your importance, but in every &s;tage of the bu&s;ine&s;s preparatory to their exhibition. To add one voice to a multitude is a &s;mall tribute to your talents; but to bear te&s;timony to your zeal, diligence, and punctuality in all tho&s;e duties of your profe&s;&s;ion, which, though of equal moment, are of le&s;s notoriety, falls fir&s;t to my lot; and if my &s;ucce&s;&s;or &s;hall feel the&s;e offices as &s;en&s;ibly as I do, he will ac|knowledge &s;tronger rea&s;ons to e&s;teem you for the good qualities originating with your&s;elf, than for the brilliant gifts which you derive from nature.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="5">
Proceed in your cour&s;e, and depend upon a generous Public. It would be living to an evil purpo&s;e indeed, if it were for no other purpo&s;e but to depre&s;s them we live with; and your contemporaries will not fail to &s;ee how much it is their concern to fo&s;ter and pro|tect a genius, which contributes to render their own times and their own country &s;uperior to all others.</P>

<LG>
<L>OLD Drury's dock prepares a launch this night,</L>
<L>New from the keel, (fair &s;peed The Carmelite!)</L>
<L>True Briti&s;h-built, and from the Tragic &s;lip;</L>
<L>She mounts great guns&mdash;tho' not a fir&s;t-rate &s;hip:</L>
<L>A gallant Knight commands, of ancient fame</L>
<L>And Norman blood, <HI>Saint Valori</HI> his name;</L>
<L>On his main-top the Chri&s;tian Cro&s;s he bears,</L>
<L>From Holy Land he comes, and Pagan wars:</L>
<L>Twenty long years his lady mourns him dead,</L>
<L>And bathes with faithful tears a widow'd bed;</L>
<L>Our &s;cene pre&s;ents him &s;hip-wreck'd on her coa&s;t&mdash;</L>
<L>No &s;ign, we hope, our venture will be lo&s;t.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet bold the Bard, to mount ambition's wave,</L>
<L>And launch his wit upon a watery grave;</L>
<L>Sharp critic rocks beneath him lie in wait,</L>
<L>And envious quick&s;ands bar the Mu&s;e's &s;traight;</L>
<L>Wild o'er his head Detraction's billows break,</L>
<L>Doubt chills his heart, and terror pales his cheek:</L>
<L>Hungry and faint, what cordials can he bring</L>
<L>From the cold nymph of the Pierian &s;pring?</L>
<L>What &s;tores collect from bare Parna&s;&s;us' head,</L>
<L>Where blooms no vineyard, where no beeves are fed?</L>
<L>And great Apollo's laurels, which impart</L>
<L>Fame to his head, are famine to his heart.&mdash;</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Yet on he toils, and eager bends his eyes,</L>
<L>Where Fame's bright temple glitters to the &s;kies.</L>
<L>Ah, Sirs, 'tis ea&s;y work, to &s;it on &s;hore</L>
<L>And tutor him who tugs the labouring oar:</L>
<L>Whil&s;t he amid&s;t the &s;urging ocean &s;teers,</L>
<L>Now here, now there, as fa&s;hion's current veers:</L>
<L>Rou&s;e, rou&s;e for his protection! you, who &s;it</L>
<L>Rang'd in deep phalanx, arbiters of wit!</L>
<L>And you aloft there, keep your beacon bright,</L>
<L>Oh, make your Eddy-&s;tone &s;hew forth it's light;</L>
<L>So &s;hall our Bard &s;teer to its friendly blaze,</L>
<L>And anchor in the haven of your prai&s;e.</L>

<L>Fix now his living image: there, as time</L>
<L>Shook not the faithful witne&s;s from my &s;oul,</L>

<L>And guard my con&s;tancy in both extremes.</L>

<LG>
<L>LADIES, we now have &s;hewn a faithful wi&s;e,</L>
<L>And tru&s;t our &s;cene prevails in real life;</L>
<L>We hope that nupital truth's your reigning pa&s;&s;ion,</L>
<L>If not&mdash;why let the &s;tage begin the fa&s;hion:</L>
<L>'Tis c$rs to paint you innocent and true;</L>
<L>To be what we de&s;cribe depends on you&mdash;</L>
<L>Two $ragic ma&s;ters grac'd th' Athenian &s;tage,</L>
<L>One &s;$$ctch'd with caudour, t'$her da&s;h'd with rage:</L>
<L>Old Sephocles's dames were heav$nly creatures,</L>
<L>His rival $rew them all in &s;ury features;</L>
<L>Both err'd, perhaps.&mdash;The $ilder urg'd this plea,</L>
<L>"I paint my women as they ou$ht to be:"</L>
<L>The angry bard, relentle&s;s to the Fair,</L>
<L>Sternly replied, "I paint mine as they are."</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Our Author (pardon if he brings his name</L>
<L>Too near to the&s;e of an immortal &s;ame)</L>
<L>At humble di&s;tance takes the milder plan,</L>
<L>Le&s;s proud to be a poet than a man:</L>
<L>Scorns fir&s;t to forge and then enforce a crime,</L>
<L>Or poli&s;h libels into truth by rhyme.</L>
<L>If you have faults, alas! he bids me &s;ay,</L>
<L>Oh! that his wi&s;h cou'd charm them all away!</L>
<L>For if no cure but cau&s;tics can be found,</L>
<L>He will not make a &s;ore to heal a wound;</L>
<L>If you have &s;aults, they're faults he won't di&s;cover,</L>
<L>To your own &s;ex he legs to bind you over.</L>
<L>So many ladies now there are who write,</L>
<L>You'll hear of all your trips &s;ome winter's night:</L>
<L>Since Pega&s;us has learn'd the jadi&s;h trick</L>
<L>To bear a &s;ide &s;adale, you'll final him hick.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>But let no &s;aty$i&s;t touch my lips with gall,</L>
<L>Lips from which none but grateful words &s;hall fall.</L>
<L>Can I forget?&mdash;But I mu&s;t here be dumb,</L>
<L>So va&s;t my debt. I cannot count the &s;um;</L>
<L>Words would int fail me, and I claim no art,</L>
<L>I bea&s;t in eloquence&mdash;but of the heart.</L>
