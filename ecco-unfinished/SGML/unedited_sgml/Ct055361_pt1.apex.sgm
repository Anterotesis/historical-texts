<HEAD>PLAN OF THE PRESENT STATE of ALL NATIONS.</HEAD>
<P>IN this frivolous age, when the powers of the under&s;tanding are all unbraced by idlene&s;s, and the mind (as it were) overborne by tides of vanity and di&s;&s;ipation, it requires &s;ome addre&s;s to reclaim the at|tention to &s;ubjects of real utility, and to render the voice of in&s;truction agreeable to the votaries of plea&s;ure: for to exerci&s;e the faculties of rea&s;on, and amu&s;e the imagi|nation at the &s;ame time, is the quinte&s;&s;ence of that happy talent which di&s;tingui&s;hes the works of genius from the dull efforts of inanimated learning.</P>
<P>One great &s;tep towards the accompli&s;h|ment of this laudable aim of mingling en|tertainment with in&s;truction, is the judici|ous choice of a &s;ubject: then follows the arrangement of the matter; and all the
<PB N="4" REF="40">
re&s;t depends upon the art of conveying ideas agreeably; an art, which may be truly &s;tiled the gift of heaven; ina&s;much as it never yet was acquired by dint of meer indu&s;try and application.</P>
<P>The &s;ubject we propo&s;e to exhibit to the Public, is in it&s;elf &s;o important, copious, and intere&s;ting, that it cannot fail to attract the notice of all tho&s;e who are de&s;irous of improvement, entertained with novelty, or plea&s;ed with the &s;tudy of human nature.</P>
<P>Indeed it is no other than a general view of Nature in all her amazing varieties di&s;|played through the animal, vegetable, and mineral kingdoms; including every diffe|rent &s;y&s;tem of &s;ociety, and &s;pecifying every invention of art for the &s;upport and enjoy|ment of life.</P>
<P>Here the naturali&s;t will find an infinity of food for philo&s;ophy and contemplation. The politician may choo&s;e modes of go|vernment, and adopt hints of legi&s;lation; and tho&s;e who employ their talents in the u&s;eful arts, will acquire di&s;tinct ideas of all the improvements which have been made by ingenuity a&s;&s;i&s;ted by experience.
<PB N="5" REF="50">
Finally, tho&s;e who have nothing in view but amu&s;ement, will here find a thou&s;and particulars to gratify the mo&s;t eager and capricious curio&s;ity.</P>
<P>The advances which mankind are daily making in u&s;eful knowledge, and the de|tached labours of the ingenious, added, from time to time, to the general &s;tock of improve|ment, enable us to pre&s;ent the Public with a work more complete and comprehen&s;ive than any production of the &s;ame nature which hath hitherto appeared: in the exe|cution of which it hath been our particu|lar care to &s;tudy per&s;picuity and preci&s;ion; to retrench &s;uperfluities; and to avoid tho&s;e dry di&s;cu&s;&s;ions which are &s;o apt to give di&s;|gu&s;t, di&s;couraging the timorous inquirer on the very thre&s;hold of &s;cience.</P>
<P>In methodizing the &s;ubject, it was judged proper to dige&s;t it into &s;eparate articles, ranged under certain heads or titles, which not only direct the view, and a&s;&s;i&s;t the com|prehen&s;ion, but al&s;o &s;erve as pau&s;es of re|po&s;e to the eye and the attention.</P>
<P>Thus, for example, in di&s;cu&s;&s;ing the ar|ticle of <HI>England:</HI> Under the fir&s;t head, its

<HEAD>SPITZBERGEN.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Its SITUATION. BOUNDARIES.</HEAD>
<P>IN taking a view of the terraqueous globe, from the North Pole, the fir&s;t land that meets the eye is the country of Spitzbergen, or Greenland, extending from the &s;eventy-&s;ixth to the eighty-&s;econd degree of north latitude. The name of Greenland was be&s;towed upon it by Sir Hugh Willoughby, who di&s;covered it in the year 1553, and &s;uppo&s;ed it to be a continuation of old Groenland: but it derived the name of Spitzbergen, or Sharp Mountains, from William Barentz and John Cor|nelius, two Dutch men, who pretended to have di&s;covered this country in the year 1595; and alledged, that the coa&s;t which Sir Hugh Wil|loughby vi&s;ited was another country, which the Hollanders accordingly have &s;et down in their maps and charts under the name of Willoughby Land; whereas, in fact, no &s;uch land ever exi&s;ted.
<PB N="2" REF="100">
But, long before the voyage of tho&s;e Dutch ad|venturers, Stephen Barrows, an Engli&s;h &s;hipma&s;ter, failed to the &s;eventy-eighth degree of latitude, and coa&s;ted along a de&s;olate country covered with blue ice, and abounding with water-fowl, as far as the latitude of eighty degrees eleven minutes. This was undoubtedly Spitzbergen, which exhibits a very wild and rugged appearance of &s;harp, icy rocks, piled one upon another. Whether this be a continent or an i&s;land, is not yet di&s;covered; nor how far it extends to the northward. Some navi|gators have conjectured, that it joins to Nova Zembla on the &s;outh-ea&s;t; while others believe, that between them there is a pa&s;&s;age into the Tar|tarean &s;ea. On the other hand, it has been ima|gined, that Spitzbergen on the we&s;t is contiguous to Groenland: this, however, is not a very probable conjecture. On the we&s;t &s;ide of Spitzbergen we find Charles I&s;land, divided from the main land by a narrow &s;treight, called Foreland Ford: between this place and Mu&s;cle Haven appear the highe&s;t mountains of Spitzbergen: the&s;e are chiefly of a red colour, and reflect the &s;un-beams &s;o as to &s;eem all on fire. There are &s;even, however, of a fine &s;ky-blue tinct, that &s;hoot up with &s;piral points re|markably &s;harp and conical. The mo&s;t commo|dious place on the i&s;land is South Haven, &s;o large as to admit forty &s;ail of &s;hips, &s;ecurely riding at anchor: here the leaks and other damages may be conveniently repaired, and the whole fleet be &s;up|plied with fre&s;h water from the melting of the &s;nows. This harbour is &s;urrounded by high mountains, and in the middle of it lies Deadman's I&s;land, &s;o denominated, becau&s;e here were buried the bodies of the &s;eamen and fi&s;hers who died in the voyage. The coa&s;t in this neighbourhood is al&s;o &s;tudded with &s;everal little i&s;les, known by the name of Fowl I&s;lands, from the va&s;t numbers of
<PB N="3" REF="110">
&s;ea-birds hatched upon them. The next large harbour has acquired the name of Maurice Bay, from the Dutch mariners, &s;ome of whom have wintered in this place. Here they have built a few huts for the convenience of making oil, and the&s;e they call Smearburg, or the Haerlem Cookery. There is likewi&s;e a north bay, in which we find an i&s;land which the Hollanders call Vogel&s;ang, from the great noi&s;e made by the water-fowl in their flight. The other known harbours of Spitzbergen are Deer Sound and Mu&s;cle Haven.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The cold at Spitzbergen, even in the &s;ummer, is inten&s;e; but in the winter altogether intolerable: it is mo&s;t rigorous when the wind blows from the north or ea&s;t; but &s;outh and we&s;t winds bring &s;now and rain, by which it is moderated. In the months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, the weather is u&s;ually calm, particularly in July, when the &s;un &s;hines &s;o hot as to melt the tar between the &s;eams of the &s;hip: this, however, is not the ca&s;e except in a dead calm; for the wind, even at this &s;ea&s;on, blows incredibly cold, and the fro&s;t continues with|out intermi&s;&s;ion. The &s;ea-water is not &s;o &s;alt here as in more &s;outherly latitudes, and is ob&s;erved to change its colour with the &s;ky. In a clear air the &s;ea is blue: when the atmo&s;phere is overca&s;t with clouds, the water appears green: in fogs it is yel|low; and quite black in &s;tormy weather. When the air is &s;erene, the ocean is &s;o tran&s;parent, that one may &s;ee to the depth of twelve or fourteen fathom.</P>
<P>In this country the &s;un appears about the middle of February, and di&s;appears about the fir&s;t of Oc|tober. From the beginning of May to the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t, he continues above the horizon without &s;etting: then the night and day are di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="4" REF="120">
by his appearing in the we&s;t, or in the ea&s;tern part of the heavens.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The face of Spitzbergen exhibits nothing but rugged rocks and bare mountains, who&s;e tops are lo&s;t among the clouds; or narrow valleys, choaked up with &s;tones and ice, that tumble from the&s;e mountains. There is, indeed, &s;ome low land about Deer Sound and Mu&s;cle Haven, generally covered with &s;now; which, in &s;ome &s;ummers, di&s;&s;olving, di&s;covers a barren coat of heath and mo&s;s, inter|&s;per&s;ed with a few plants: this is likewi&s;e the ca&s;e with the &s;ides of &s;ome mountains expo&s;ed to the reflection of the &s;un.</P>
<P>The rivers of this country, &s;o far as they have been di&s;covered, are all bracki&s;h; and no &s;prings have yet been found: but this inconvenience is remedied by the great plenty of &s;now-water, which is found to be both agreeable and &s;alubrious.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PRODUCTIONS: VEGETABLES and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>The dung of tho&s;e birds which inhabit the clifts of the rocks, being, together with the mo&s;s, wa&s;hed down by the melted &s;now, forms a rich mould in &s;ome level places near the &s;hore. The&s;e produce a variety of plants; among which we number excellent &s;curvy-gra&s;s, a kind of wild let|tuce, &s;orrel, &s;nake-root, mou&s;e-ear, ground-ivy, lime-wort, heart's-ea&s;e, &s;ea-buglo&s;s, wild &s;traw|berries, hou&s;e-leek, and wall-pepper. The&s;e are con&s;idered as effectual remedies, &s;upplied by the hand of Providence, for the cure of the &s;curvy, and other di&s;ea&s;es, incident to the adventurers who yearly vi&s;it this inho&s;pitable country. The &s;curvy|gra&s;s here, as in many other northern climates, has no pungency to the ta&s;te; but is mild and e&s;culent, grateful to the palate, and &s;uch an excellent anti|&s;corbutic,
<PB N="5" REF="130">
that the &s;eamen term it <HI>the gift of God.</HI> Although the &s;hips employed in the whale-fi&s;hery are, of all others, the be&s;t &s;upplied with good pro|vi&s;ion and plenty of fre&s;h water; yet the mariners are, in the&s;e northern latitudes, much more &s;ubject to the &s;ea-&s;curvy than in any &s;outhern voyage. The attack of the malady is here more &s;udden, and the progre&s;s of it more rapid. The patient feels his &s;ymptoms increa&s;e as he advances nearer the Pole; nor does he enjoy the lea&s;t alleviation, until the weather &s;oftens in the month of July, which is very moderate, and indeed the only interruption of winter. Then the &s;curvy-gra&s;s appears in plenty, as an infallible cure, and performs wonders; re|&s;toring in a few days, to health and vigour, tho&s;e who were &s;eemingly in the la&s;t and mortal &s;tage of the di&s;temper. Spitzbergen likewi&s;e produces dande|lion, &s;axifrage, mountain-heath, poppies, hellebore, and dwarf-willow, with many other plants, found likewi&s;e in Scotland and Wales, as well as &s;ome non|de&s;cripts; but all of them are &s;mall and &s;tunted, the natural con&s;equence of a &s;canty &s;oil and inclement &s;ky. Corn, kitchen-herbs, and fruit-trees, have never been &s;own or planted in this &s;oil; nor would the experiment &s;ucceed in &s;uch a rigorous climate.</P>
<P>From the nature of the rocks, which have been &s;plit by fro&s;t, and tumbled down in fragments, hard, ponderous, and &s;parry, naturali&s;ts have con|jectured that Spitzbergen abounds with iron: nor is this de&s;olate country de&s;titute of more valuable metals. About the year 1737, Mr. Cracraft, a well-known commander in the Greenland trade, brought to England &s;everal pieces of gold ore, which he found accidentally in a hunting excur|&s;ion, among the rocks of Spitzbergen. In con&s;e|quence of this di&s;covery, and the large proportion of metal found in a&s;&s;aying the ore, he next year provided him&s;elf with tools and implements for
<PB N="6" REF="140">
digging and working: but this avocation inter|fering with the fi&s;hery, which was the principal aim of his voyage, and &s;ome other difficulties ari&s;ing, the di&s;covery was not pro&s;ecuted with that vigour which its importance &s;eemed to require. Here we likewi&s;e find &s;ome <HI>lapis &s;picularis,</HI> ala|ba&s;ter, and &s;elenites.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The native animals of Spitzbergen are bears, deer, foxes, &s;eals, and &s;ea-hor&s;es. The bears have long &s;nouts, and bark like dogs that are hoar&s;e. They are all white, lean, &s;wift, extremely fierce, and incredibly large. One bear has been found &s;ix feet high, fourteen feet long, and yielded one hundred weight of fat. The large&s;t are called water-bears, becau&s;e they live upon what the &s;ea affords, and have been &s;een fourteen miles from &s;hore. When a bear is attacked, and begins to roar, his fellows run to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and the dam will &s;uffer her&s;elf to be killed, rather than abandon her cubs: neverthele&s;s, when a bear is found dead by his fellows, they eat him without &s;cruple. They are commonly killed with mu&s;kets and lances; yet &s;o very tenacious of life, that a bear has often made his e&s;cape with &s;everal &s;hots in his body. The&s;e creatures are &s;o &s;timulated with hunger, that they frequently attack whole armed crews: nay, they have been known to take the water, and endea|vour to board large ve&s;&s;els. When the bear is at bay, he ri&s;es on his hind legs, and often breaks in pieces the lances of his a&s;&s;ailants; &s;o that he is not attacked without imminent danger. He lives upon &s;eals and dead whales, in que&s;t of which he is &s;ometimes &s;een thirty leagues at &s;ea, on floats of ice. He takes the water naturally, and, when attacked, will dive like an otter.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="150">
The deer of Greenland, or Spitzbergen, are large, grey, and &s;haggy, with long ears, &s;hort tails, and branching horns. By feeding on the yellow mo&s;s in the &s;ummer, they grow exceeding fat; and their fle&s;h, when roa&s;ted, is of an exqui&s;ite flavour. This &s;tore of fat enables them to &s;ub&s;i&s;t in the winter; during which, however, many are &s;tarved, and all of them are exceedingly meagre in the &s;pring <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In all probability the&s;e ani|mals &s;leep in caverns during the winter, like the bears in Norway: perhaps the abun|dance of poppies in this coun|try may di&s;po&s;e them to a le|thargy, which &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary for their pre&s;ervation; as little or no nouri&s;hment is required for animals that have no exer|ci&s;e, and a languid circula|tion.</NOTE>. They fly at &s;ight of a human crea|ture; but &s;top when he &s;tops, and thus are &s;hot without difficulty. Here are many foxes of va|rious colours, black, grey, and white; and prodi|gious numbers of &s;eals and &s;ea-hor&s;es, which we &s;hall have occa&s;ion to de&s;cribe in the &s;equel. Of land-birds, few are to be &s;een in Greenland; ex|cept the partridge, which re&s;embles our grow&s;e, and &s;ome &s;mall birds, that &s;ometimes are heard to warble &s;weetly, even in this dreary climate: but of water-fowl innumerable &s;warms, &s;uch as are common to all the northern countries of Europe, and will be particularly de&s;cribed in our accounts of Iceland, Norway, and the Hebrides.</P>
<P>The produce of the &s;ea in the&s;e parts de&s;erves particular attention, as this alone has induced the more &s;outhern nations to &s;end annual fleets to the bleak coa&s;t of Spitzbergen. The northern &s;ea is the native country of the whale, which is ju&s;tly deemed the mo&s;t important fi&s;h that &s;wims, whe|ther we con&s;ider its enormous &s;ize, or the profits it yields to the fi&s;herman in the articles of oil and whalebone: over and above the&s;e advan|tages accruing to &s;ociety from the whale-fi&s;hery, it
<PB N="8" REF="160">
employs and maintains a great number of people, and breeds the be&s;t and hardie&s;t &s;eamen that be|long to the community.</P>
<P>Of the whale &s;pecies there are many different kinds, known by various denominations, and ap|pearing of very different &s;izes and configurations. The Spitzbergen whale, which is the large&s;t and mo&s;t valuable, generally extends to the length of &s;ixty feet; though &s;ome are found more than twice as long. The true whale of &s;ixty feet is commonly about forty feet in circumference at the &s;houlders, from whence he tapers to the tail, which is forked and horizontal. He is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed from the other kinds by his want of teeth; in&s;tead of which he is &s;upplied with that &s;ub&s;tance called the whale-bone, growing on each &s;ide of his upper jaw, in four or five hundred blades, di&s;|po&s;ed at equal di&s;tances: &s;ome of the&s;e exceed twelve feet in length, and are one foot broad at bottom, from whence they grow narrower up|wards, like the &s;ticks of a fan inverted: the large&s;t of them weighs about twenty pounds each. The opening between the&s;e blades is contracted when he &s;huts, and dilated when he opens his mouth; and &s;erves to &s;train the water from the &s;hrimps, prawns, and other &s;mall in&s;ects on which the whale is &s;uppo&s;ed chiefly to &s;ub&s;i&s;t: but a percolation &s;till more fine is performed by a quantity of hair, adhering to the in&s;ide of the jaw, next the tongue. His throat is very &s;mall, in proportion to his bulk; as are likewi&s;e his eyes, which mea&s;ure each about &s;ix inches over, provided with eyelids and la&s;hes, like tho&s;e of a human creature. His bones are hard, porous, and full of marrow: his back and belly are of a du&s;ki&s;h red colour: his fle&s;h is coar&s;e, hard, lean, dry, and &s;inewy: the fat or blubber is contained in a cellular membrane, immediately under the &s;kin. A great number of &s;trong ten|dons
<PB N="9" REF="170">
are united at the tail, with which he turns and winds him&s;elf, as a &s;hip is guided by the rud|der. Be&s;ides the &s;kin, he is covered with a &s;ort of cuticle, or &s;carf-&s;kin, which is very thin and ten|der. The whale &s;wims with &s;urpri&s;ing celerity, and plows the &s;ea like a &s;hip under &s;ail. He is very &s;ubject to be tormented by a &s;pecies of lice, that bite &s;o &s;everely as to make him flounce and flounder, and even &s;pring above the &s;urface of the ocean: he is likewi&s;e &s;uppo&s;ed to feel cramps, and unea&s;y &s;en&s;ations in his body, on a &s;udden change of weather, as he generally tumbles about with great agitation immediately before a &s;torm. But, notwith&s;tanding his &s;trength, he is remarkably timorous, and very ea&s;ily ma&s;tered. An ordinary whale yields from &s;eventy to an hundred barrels of blubber, which is the fat contained in ve&s;icles im|mediately under the &s;kin.</P>
<P>A de&s;cription of the method practi&s;ed in killing and catching whales, will not be di&s;agreeable to the reader. A whale is no &s;ooner perceived &s;pouting the water from the two &s;pout-holes, that open on his neck, than every &s;hip's long-boat is hoi&s;ted out, and manned with &s;ix or &s;even &s;eamen, who row directly towards the fi&s;h; which when they approach, the har|pooner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">When the harpoon is u&s;ed in this manner, the boat is row|ed full upon the whale's back, and the in&s;trument is thru&s;t in by the weight of the harpoon|er's body; but now it is cu&s;|tomary to &s;hoot the harpoon from a mu&s;quetoon, at &s;ome di&s;tance from the whale: a me|thod much more effectual than the other.</NOTE> &s;tanding in the bow of the boat, &s;trikes him with his harpoon. This is a kind of a lance, headed with iron, in the manner of an arrow, and fa&s;tened to a line of great length. The bones of the head are extremely hard; but near the &s;pout-holes there is a ma&s;s of mu&s;cular fle&s;h, which the harpoon penetrates to a great depth. The whale being &s;truck, flies through the water with &s;uch celerity,

that, were he not indulged with a &s;cope of line, he would inevitably &s;ink the boat. The fi&s;hermen, therefore, are very careful in having the rope un|intangled, and water it as it runs, otherwi&s;e it would fire the boat. The fir&s;t &s;ix or &s;even fathom are made of the fine&s;t and &s;ofte&s;t hemp, that it may run the more ea&s;ily; and this portion they call the fore-runner: but the length of the whole line extends to ninety or an hundred fathoms. When the harpoon takes place, the boat follows the line; and the other long-boats row on before, to ob&s;erve which way it turns, that the whale's track may be the more ea&s;ily di&s;covered. They &s;ometimes feel the line, and, if there is a &s;trong re&s;i&s;tance, they conclude that the whale's &s;trength is not yet abated: but, when it floats loo&s;e upon the water, they know he is either weak or dead, and take it in gently with caution, &s;o as that it may be ready for him, in ca&s;e he &s;hould recover, and pull again. Even in the vigour of his career, they are careful in keeping the line tight; for, when they indulge him with a &s;uperfluity, it is &s;ometimes intangled about a rock, and the whale, by continuing to pull, di&s;engages the harpoon. As &s;oon as he begins to &s;pout blood, they know he is near his end, and prepare for the operation of cutting him in pieces. A lean whale &s;inks when dead, and does not float again for &s;everal days, until the juices, putrefying and fermenting, di&s;tend the ve&s;&s;els, and increa&s;e the volume of the body, &s;o that it becomes &s;pecifically lighter than the &s;ea|water. Soon as the whale expires he begins to &s;tink; and the putrid &s;teams that ri&s;e from his body are &s;o acrid, as to inflame the eyes of the fi&s;hermen. When the carca&s;e begins to float, it is hauled clo&s;e to the &s;tern of the &s;hip, and the men begin to cut it into &s;lices with great knives. The&s;e large flakes, containing the blubber, being hoi&s;ted
<PB N="11" REF="190">
on board, are &s;trung upon ropes, and hauled on &s;hore; where they are again chopped into &s;maller pieces, on a block made of the whale's tail. The&s;e being again &s;ubdivided into portions no larger than a trencher, are thrown into coppers, fixed for the purpo&s;e: and in the&s;e the oil is melted from the cells. The membranous parts, beginning to look brown, acquire the name of fritters, and are thrown away, becau&s;e this appearance declares that they are wholly deprived of the oil; which is now laded out of the coppers into a boat half filled with water, in which it is cooled and clean&s;ed: from hence it is conveyed through long troughs into hog&s;heads, or barrels, ranged upon the &s;hore. The whale's head being cut off, and carried on &s;hore, the fi&s;hermen extract the whalebone, which they tie up in fillets; and then the re&s;t of the head is boiled for the benefit of the oil. The tongue of an ordinary whale is as large as an woolpack, and will yield &s;ix hog&s;heads of oil: it is drawn a&s;hore, cut up, and boiled in the &s;ame manner practi&s;ed upon the other parts that contain the blubber. Such was the antient way of procuring the oil on the &s;pot: but now the blubber is bar|relled up in &s;mall pieces, and brought over to England or Holland to be boiled at lei&s;ure. The huts on Spitzbergen are quite neglected; and many &s;hips return from the whale-fi&s;hing without ever having been in &s;ight of that country. They &s;ail to a certain latitude frequented by the whales, and fi&s;h at &s;ea, without being mole&s;ted by a lee|&s;hore, ice, or currents.</P>
<P>Ships employed in the whale-fi&s;hery ought to be very large, remarkably &s;trong, to &s;u&s;tain &s;hocks from the floating ice, and manned each with thirty or forty bold hardy mariners. Every &s;hip ought to be provided with five or &s;ix &s;tout boats, well &s;upplied with healthy provi&s;ions, plenty of &s;pirits,
<PB N="12" REF="200">
a great number of lances, harpoons, and fi&s;h-gigs, and at lea&s;t thirty lines of an hundred fathoms in length. In this latitude the adventures often meet with another &s;pecies of the whale, which they denominate the fin-fi&s;h. This animal is as long, but not half &s;o thick as the other whale: yet he blows the water higher, and from this cir|cum&s;tance has acquired the name of Trumpeter. His lips are twi&s;ted like a cable, and the whale|bone hangs from his upper lip. In colour he re|&s;embles the teneh, is extremely nimble, and &s;o &s;trong, that the fi&s;hermen dare not &s;trike him near the edge of the ice, le&s;t, by a &s;udden jerk with his tail, he &s;hould pull them and the boat under it. The&s;e fi&s;h, however, do not appear until the other whales have quitted the coa&s;t. Here likewi&s;e they find in plenty the whale-ru&s;h, mor&s;e, or &s;ea-hor&s;e, re&s;embling the &s;eal in &s;hape, but as large as an ox. The head is thick, round, and compact: the neck is covered with a thick &s;kin and &s;hort hair: on the re&s;t of the body the &s;kin is thicker, and the hair longer. In the upper jaw are two tu&s;ks, about &s;ix and twenty inches long, which are equal, in whitene&s;s and poli&s;h, to the teeth of the elephant. This creature feeds upon herbs and fi&s;h, and is amphibious. They are often &s;een in multitudes lying on the rocks, and ba&s;king in the &s;un. The mor&s;e is a bold and fierce animal: when attacked, he turns upon the boat; and &s;ometimes &s;trikes his teeth through the &s;ides of it, or endeavours to leap on board. He is not ea&s;ily killed either with &s;hot or blows, and therefore the &s;eamen commonly di&s;|patch him with lances. When whales are &s;carce, the adventures make up their voyage with the teeth and oil of this animal. Of the whale kind there are al&s;o the dragon-fi&s;h, long, thin, grey, and glittering, with two fins on his back, and two holes, through which he &s;pouts the water; the
<PB N="13" REF="210">
But&s;horf, or lace-head, &s;ixteen feet long, with a &s;pout-hole in his neck, a brown back, and a white belly; and the white-fi&s;h, as long as the but&s;horf, but much fatter: the &s;ea-unicorn, from &s;ixteen to twenty feet in length, with a &s;pout-hole in his neck, and projecting from his &s;nout a fine wreathed horn, for which he is chiefly valued. The throne of his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty is entirely compo&s;ed of the&s;e horns, which were formerly deemed &s;pecificks again&s;t poi&s;on. All the&s;e fi&s;h &s;wim again&s;t the wind, and are ob&s;erved to tumble immediately before &s;torms; a circum&s;tance from which &s;ome naturali&s;ts have concluded, that from the change in the atmo&s;phere they were &s;eized with the cramp in their bellies. The whale is harra&s;&s;ed by a va|riety of enemies. Be&s;ides the vermin that adhere to his body like lice, he is pur&s;ued by the &s;aw-fi&s;h, or &s;word-fi&s;h, &s;ome of which &s;pecies are twenty feet long: he is &s;haped like a man's arm, and his eyes are very prominent: his &s;word projects from his &s;nout, of different lengths, according to the different &s;izes of the fi&s;h; &s;ometimes &s;mooth and &s;harp, like a real &s;word; &s;ometimes indented like a &s;aw: hence the creature is called either &s;word-fi&s;h or &s;aw-fi&s;h. A very few of the&s;e ani|mals will attack and ma&s;ter a great whale; yet, when they have &s;lain him, they eat no part of him but the tongue. In calm weather the fi&s;hermen lie upon their oars as &s;pectators of this combat, until they perceive the whale at the la&s;t ga&s;p: then they row towards him, and his enemies retiring at their approach, they enjoy the fruits of the victory. There is another more de&s;perate enemy of the whale, known by the name of hay, a kind of &s;hark, of different &s;izes, from one to three fathoms; &s;o vo|racious, that it tears large pieces of fle&s;h from the whale, as if they had been dug with &s;hovels. The liver of this fi&s;h is very large, and abounds
<PB N="14" REF="220">
with oil: the fle&s;h of the back, when dried, is counted tolerable provi&s;ion, either boiled or roa&s;ted. The hay is caught by a large hook, baited with fle&s;h, and fa&s;tened to a &s;trong iron chain, in&s;tead of a line, which he could ea&s;ily bite a&s;under. If a man &s;hould fall overboard when this animal is at hand, he would attack and devour him in an in&s;tant.</P>

The&s;e are &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;wept down by the great Tartarean rivers, which annually overflow, and di&s;embogue them&s;elves into the ocean, where the timber is frozen all the win|ter, and &s;et afloat again by the thaw in the &s;pring.</P>
<P>Directly &s;outh of Spitzbergen, between this land and the continent of Europe, we find Cherry I&s;land, lying in the latitude of &s;eventy-four degrees and five minutes; &s;o called in honour of Sir Francis Cherry, who equipped the ve&s;&s;el by which it was di&s;covered in the year 1603. The i&s;land abounds with wild fowl, &s;eals, and &s;ea-hor&s;es, which have been killed in va&s;t numbers by Engli&s;h ad|venturers. The Ru&s;&s;ian company took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the year 1610; and di&s;covered upon it, as well as upon other &s;mall i&s;lands by which it is &s;ur|rounded, mines of lead and coal, which might be wrought to great advantage if a colony was &s;ettled, &s;o as that the people would winter on the &s;pot: and &s;urely, with proper precautions and conve|niences, this country is as habitable as &s;ome parts of Hud&s;on's Bay, where the company's officers and &s;ervants re&s;ide all the winter. In con&s;equence of &s;ome un&s;ucce&s;sful voyages to Cherry I&s;land, the Ru&s;&s;ian company de&s;i&s;ted from &s;ending &s;hips thi|ther; and this place has been de&s;erted for the la&s;t hundred years.</P>

<HEAD>Its SITUATION and APPEARANCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE country that was fir&s;t in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this name, lies but forty miles to the we&s;tward of Iceland, beginning in fifty-nine degrees and fifty minutes of northern latitude. The ea&s;tern coa&s;t is &s;uppo&s;ed to extend northerly as far as Spitzbergen, which &s;ome navigators have conjectured to be an i&s;land &s;eparated by a narrow channel from the con|tinent of Greenland. The we&s;tern &s;hore has been di&s;covered even beyond the &s;eventieth degree: but, whether it be a large i&s;land, or contiguous to North America, co&s;mographers have not yet been able to determine. This que&s;tion, indeed, cannot be de|cided, until &s;ome adventurers &s;hall have penetrated into the bottom of Davis's Streights, or rather Baffin's Bay, which is a continuation of the&s;e Streights: and here it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve of the Streight of Frobi&s;her in Greenland, that the reverend Mr. Egede, who re&s;ided fifteen years in this country, and &s;eems to have taken great pains in extending his inquiries, declares that he could find no &s;uch Streight, nor any place like Bear Sound in the coa&s;t of Groenland, though the&s;e are laid down in all the &s;ea-charts, as forming two large i&s;lands adjacent to the main land. If we may be|lieve what information has been gleaned from tho&s;e natives who inhabit the mo&s;t northern parts of Groenland, there is but a very narrow pa&s;&s;age be|tween
<PB N="17" REF="250">
this country and America. They affirm they have &s;poken with the people of the other &s;ide, who&s;e language re&s;embles their own; and they al|ledge the &s;treight is &s;o contracted in one place, that two per&s;ons can &s;hoot at the &s;ame fi&s;h from oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the channel. In all probability, however, this narrow &s;treight is no more than a &s;mall body of water that divides Groenland from one of the le&s;&s;er i&s;lands; and that if there is no north-we&s;t pa&s;&s;age towards the bottom of Ba&s;&s;in's Bay, Groenland it&s;elf is part of the American continent.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, Groenland is a mountainous country, &s;o high as to be di&s;cerned thirty leagues at &s;ea. The inland mountains, hills, and rocks, are covered with eternal &s;now: but the low lands on the &s;ea-&s;ide are in &s;ummer cloathed with verdure. The coa&s;t abounds with inlets, bays, and large rivers; and is &s;urrounded with a va&s;t number of i&s;lands of different dimen&s;ions: but what ren|ders it in many places inacce&s;&s;ible, are the moun|tains and i&s;lands of ice floating and fixed, that ap|pear like in&s;uperable barriers along the &s;hore, and &s;eem to interdict all manner of approach. The principal river, called Baal, falls into the &s;ea in the latitude of &s;ixty-four, where the fir&s;t Dani&s;h lodge was &s;ettled in the year 1721, and has been navi|gated above forty miles up the country.</P>

<HEAD>FIRST SETTLEMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Groenland was &s;ettled in the eighth century by a company of Icelanders headed by Ericke Rande, who had been driven by accident on the coa&s;t, and repre&s;ented the country in &s;uch a favourable light to his countrymen, that &s;ome families followed him thither, and &s;ettled on the ea&s;tern part, where they happily increa&s;ed and multiplied; be&s;towing on their new habitation the name of Greenland or
<PB N="18" REF="260">
Greenland, on account of its verdant appearance. This colony was converted to chri&s;tianity by a mi&s;|&s;ionary prie&s;t from Norway, &s;ent thither by the ce|labrated Olaf, the fir&s;t Norwegian &s;overeign who embraced the doctrines of Chri&s;t. The Groenland &s;ettlement throve under his protection; and in a little time, the country was provided with many towns, churches, convents, bi&s;hops, and a regu|lar clergy, &s;uffragans to the archbi&s;hop of Dron|theim. A con&s;iderable commerce was carried on between them and Norway, and a regular inter|cour&s;e maintained till the year 1406, when the la&s;t bi&s;hop was &s;ent over to Groenland: from that period, all corre&s;pondence was cut off, and all knowledge of Groenland con&s;igned to oblivion. This &s;trange and abrupt ce&s;&s;ation of trade and intercour&s;e has been a&s;cribed partly to the change and tran&s;lation of the Norwegian government in the reign of queen Margaret; partly to the en&s;u|ing wars between Denmark and Sweden, which could not fail to interrupt the maritime commerce; and partly to the difficulty and danger which at|tended the navigation to Groenland: but the mo&s;t probable cau&s;e of &s;uch a &s;udden privation is found in another event. The inland colony, from its fir&s;t &s;ettlement, had been harra&s;&s;ed by the Abori|gines of Groenland, a &s;avage barbarous people, agreeing in cu&s;toms, garb, and appearance, with tho&s;e Americans who have &s;ince been found to the northward of Hud&s;on's Bay. This nation, called Schrellings, at length prevailed again&s;t the Iceland &s;ettlers who had cho&s;en their habitation in the we&s;t|ern di&s;trict, and exterminated them in the fourteenth century: in&s;omuch that when their brethren of the ea&s;tern di&s;trict came to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they found nothing alive but &s;ome cattle and flocks of &s;heep running wild about the fields and meadows. Perhaps they them&s;elves afterwards experienced
<PB N="19" REF="270">
the &s;ame fate, and were totally de&s;troyed by tho&s;e Schrellings, who&s;e de&s;cendants &s;till inhabit the we&s;tern parts of Groenland, and from tradition con|firm this conjecture. They affirm, that the hou&s;es and villages who&s;e ruins &s;till appear, were inhabited by a nation of &s;trangers whom their ance&s;tors de|&s;troyed. There are &s;ome rea&s;ons, however, for believing that there may be &s;till &s;ome de&s;cendants of the antient Iceland colony remaining in the ea&s;tern di&s;trict, though they cannot be vi&s;ited by land on account of the &s;tupendous mountains, perpetually covered with fro&s;t and &s;now, which divide the two parts of Groenland; while they have been rendered inacce&s;&s;ible from &s;ea, by the va&s;t quantity of ice driven from Spitzbergen and other northern coa&s;ts upon this ea&s;tern &s;hore, to which it adheres, form|ing an in&s;uperable barricado. One would imagine there mu&s;t have been &s;ome con&s;iderable alteration in the terraqueous globe &s;ince the fifteenth century, in con&s;equence of which tho&s;e coa&s;ts became inac|ce&s;&s;ible, that were antiently vi&s;ited without much peril. The reader too will naturally a&s;k by what means the people of the ea&s;tern colony &s;urmounted the above-mentioned ob&s;tacles when they went to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of their we&s;tern friends; how they re|turned to their own country, and in what manner hi&s;torians learned the &s;ucce&s;s of their expedition. All that we gather from authentic records, is, that Groenland was divided into two di&s;tricts, called We&s;t Bygd, and Ea&s;t Bygd; that the we&s;tern divi|&s;ion contained four pari&s;hes, and one hundred vil|lages; that the ea&s;tern di&s;trict was &s;till more flou|ri&s;hing, as being nearer to Iceland, &s;ooner &s;ettled, and more frequented by &s;hipping from Norway. That this colony is not yet extinct, has been con|jectured from the following circum&s;tances: if we may believe Thormoder in his hi&s;tory of Groen|land, Amand, bi&s;hop of Shalholt in Iceland, re|turning
<PB N="20" REF="280">
from Norway, about the year 1530, was driven upon the coa&s;t of Groenland, along which he &s;ailed northerly as far as Herjol&s;ne&s;s, where, being clo&s;e in &s;hore, he and all the people on board could ea&s;ily de&s;cry the inhabitants driving their flocks in the pa&s;ture grounds: but, the wind proving fair, the bi&s;hop, in&s;tead of landing, directed his cour&s;e for Iceland, and next morning came to anchor in the bay of St. Patrick. The ma&s;ter of an Hamburgh ve&s;&s;el, being forced al&s;o by adver&s;e winds on the coa&s;t of this country, where he had well nigh peri&s;hed among the ice, at la&s;t entered a fine bay, where he found &s;everal green i&s;lands inhabited. After &s;ome he&s;itation he went a&s;hore in his boat, and vi&s;ited the neare&s;t hou&s;e, which was very &s;mall, mean, and inconvenient. Here he found all the tackle belonging to a fi&s;hing-boat. At a little di&s;tance was a hut, or booth, built of &s;tones, for the conveniency of drying fi&s;h, accord|ing to the method practi&s;ed in Iceland. In this hut he &s;aw the dead body of a man, extended on the ground, with his face downwards, and a &s;ewed cap on his head: his garb con&s;i&s;ted partly of coar&s;e cloth, and partly of &s;eal-&s;kin; and by his &s;ide lay a ru&s;ty knife, which the captain brought to Iceland as a te&s;timony of what he had &s;een. This di&s;co|very mu&s;t have been made above a century; as the annals in which we find it, were compo&s;ed about fifty years ago, by Beorno of Skar&s;aa. The &s;ame author affirms, that on the &s;ea-&s;hore of Ice|land, the inhabitants often find old broken pieces of deal-boards, which had been part of boats, payed with a &s;ort of pitch or glue made of &s;eal|blubber; which kind of glue is u&s;ed in no coun|try but Groenland. In the year 1625, an intire boat was thrown upon a point of land near Riechi|&s;trand, of a very artificial &s;tructure; the boards being joined together by wooden pegs or nails,
<PB N="21" REF="290">
and further &s;ecured with the &s;inews of animals. Beorno likewi&s;e, in his book <HI>de Novitiis Groen|landorum Indiciis,</HI> gives us to under&s;tand, that even &s;ince this event an oar was found on the ea&s;tern &s;hore of Iceland, in&s;cribed with the&s;e words in Runic characters, <Q><HI>Oft var ek da&s;cedar ek dro dick;</HI> &s;ignifying, &startq;Often was I tired, when I carried thee.&endq;</Q> Dithmarus Blefkenius, a German writer, tells us, he was acquainted in Norway with a monk of Groenland, who accompanied his bi&s;hop thither in the year 1564: but, if all intercour&s;e was cut off with Groenland in the year 1406, how could a monk and bi&s;hop of that country be in Norway, above a whole century after this period? Be&s;ides, Arngrim Jona refutes this relation of Blefkenius, in a treati&s;e intituled <HI>Anatome Blefkeniana.</HI> In confirmation, however, of what that monk was &s;uppo&s;ed to have related, Era&s;mus Franci&s;cus, in his book called <HI>the Ea&s;t and We&s;t India State-garden,</HI> treating of Groenland, &s;ays, that one Jacob Hall, captain of a Dani&s;h &s;hip, had conver&s;ed with &s;uch a monk in Iceland, remarkable for his broad and tawny face. The friar informed him of a Groen|land convent of Dominicans, dedicated to St. Thomas; to which belonged a well of boiling hot water, which warmed all the cells, by being con|veyed through each in leaden pipes. That there was &s;uch a convent and &s;uch a &s;pring of hot water in Groenland, appears al&s;o from the relation of Nicholas Zenetur, a Venetian captain in the &s;ervice of Denmark, tran&s;mitted to us by Kercherus. According to his account, the water &s;erved not only to warm the cells and apartments of the con|vent, but likewi&s;e for boiling meat, and baking bread. Hard by was a volcano, which had di&s;|charged a quantity of pumice-&s;tones &s;ufficient to build the convent, which was provided with a fine large garden, that, by means of this water, pro|duced
<PB N="22" REF="300">
all &s;orts of flowers and fruit. The warm water, having watered the garden, di&s;charged it&s;elf into an adjoining bay, which never froze; but abounded with fi&s;h and wild fowl, yielding plenty of provi&s;ion to the inhabitants. Though this ac|count &s;eems altogether romantic, and but very in|differently atte&s;ted, we &s;till have a right to &s;uppo&s;e that there may be &s;ome remains of the antient ea&s;tern colony, which certainly comprehended twelve exten&s;ive pari&s;hes, one hundred and ninety villages, a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and two mona&s;teries. The pre&s;ent inhabitants of the we&s;tern di&s;trict are en|tirely ignorant of this part, from which they are divided by rocks, mountains, and de&s;erts; and &s;till more effectually by their apprehen&s;ion: for they believe the ea&s;tern Groenlanders to be a cruel barbarous nation, that de&s;troy and eat all &s;trangers who fall into their hands. About a century after all intercour&s;e between Norway and Groenland had cea&s;ed, &s;everal &s;hips were &s;ent &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by the kings of Denmark, in order to di&s;cover the ea&s;tern di&s;trict; but all of them mi&s;carried. Among the&s;e adventurers, Mogens Hein&s;on, after having &s;ur|mounted many difficulties and dangers, got &s;ight of the land, which however he could not approach. At his return he pretended that the &s;hip was ar|re&s;ted in the middle of her cour&s;e, by certain rocks of load&s;tone at the bottom of the &s;ea. The &s;ame year, 1576, in which this attempt was made, has been rendered remarkable by the voyage of captain Martin Forbi&s;her, &s;ent upon the &s;ame errand by queen Elizabeth. He likewi&s;e de&s;cribed the land, but could not reach it, and therefore returned to England; yet not before he had &s;ailed &s;ixty leagues in the &s;treight which &s;till retains his name, and landed on &s;everal i&s;lands, where he had &s;ome com|munication with the natives. He had likewi&s;e taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country in the name of

In the en&s;uing &s;pring he undertook a &s;econd voyage, at the head of a &s;mall &s;quadron, equipped at the ex|pence of the publick; entered the &s;treights a &s;econd time; di&s;covered upon an i&s;land a gold and &s;ilver mine; be&s;towed names upon different bays, i&s;lands, and headlands; and brought away a lading of ore, together with two natives, a male and a female, whom the Engli&s;h kidnapped.</P>
<P>Such was the &s;ucce&s;s of this voyage, that another armament was fitted out under the au&s;pices of ad|miral Forbi&s;her, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen &s;ail, including a con&s;iderable number of &s;oldiers, miners, &s;mel|ters, carpenters, and bakers, to remain all the winter near the mines in a wooden fort, the dif|ferent pieces of which they carried out in the tran&s;ports. They met with boi&s;terous weather, impenetrable fogs, and violent currents upon the coa&s;t of Groenland, which retarded their opera|tions until the &s;ea&s;on was far advanced. Part of their wooden fort was lo&s;t at &s;ea; and they had neither provi&s;ion nor fuel &s;ufficient for the winter. The admiral therefore determined to return with as much ore as he could procure: of this they ob|tained large quantities out of a new mine, to which they gave the name of the counte&s;s of Su&s;|&s;ex. They likewi&s;e built an hou&s;e of &s;tone and lime, provided with ovens; and here, with a view to conciliate the affection of the natives, they left a quantity of &s;mall morrice-bells, knives, beads, looking-gla&s;&s;es, leaden pictures, and other toys, together with &s;everal loaves of bread. They bu|ried the timber of the fort where it could be ea&s;ily found next year, and &s;owed corn, pea&s;e, and other grain, by way of experiment, to know what the country would produce.

<P>Chri&s;tian IV. king of Denmark, being de&s;irous of di&s;covering the old Greenland &s;ettlement, &s;ent three &s;hips thither, under the command of captain God&s;ke Lindenow; who is &s;aid to have reached the ea&s;t coa&s;t of Groenland, where he traded with the &s;avage inhabitants, &s;uch as they are &s;till found in the we&s;tern di&s;trict, but &s;aw no &s;igns of a civi|lized people. Had he actually landed in the ea&s;tern divi&s;ion, he mu&s;t have perceived &s;ome re|mains of the antient colony, even in the ruins of their convents and villages. Lindenow kidnapped two of the natives, who were conveyed to Copen|hagen; and the &s;ame cruel fraud <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Nothing can be more in|human and repugnant to the dictates of common ju&s;tice, than this practice of tearing away poor creatures from their country, their families, and connexions; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e them altogether de&s;titute of natural affection: that this was not the ca&s;e with tho&s;e poor Greenlanders, &s;ome of whom were brought alive to Copen|hagen, appears from the whole tenour of their conduct, upon their fir&s;t capture, and during their confinement in Denmark. When fir&s;t captivated, they rent the air with their cries and lamentations: they even leaped into the &s;ea, and when taken on board, for &s;ome time refu&s;ed all &s;u&s;tenance. Their eyes were continually turned towards their dear country, and their faces always bathed in tears. Even the counte|nance of his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty, and the care&s;&s;es of the court and people, could not alle|viate their grief. One of them was perceived to &s;hed tears al|ways when he &s;aw an infant in the mother's arms: a circum|&s;tance from whence it was na|turally concluded, that he had left his wife with a young child in Groenland. Two of them went to &s;ea in their little canoes, in hope of reaching Groenland; but one of them was retaken. Other two made the &s;ame attempt; but were driven by a &s;torm on the coa&s;t of Schonen, where they were apprehended by the pea&s;ants, and reconveyed to Copen|hagen. One of them after|wards died of a fever, caught in fi&s;hing pearl, during the winter, for the governor of Kolding.

Streights, where they di&s;covered divers fine har|bours, and delightful meadows covered with ver|dure. In &s;ome places they are &s;aid to have found a con&s;iderable quantity of ore, every hundred pounds of which yielded twenty-&s;ix ounces of &s;ilver. The &s;ame admiral Lindenow made another voyage to the coa&s;t of Greenland in the year 1606, directing his cour&s;e to the we&s;tward of Cape Fare|well. He coa&s;ted along the Streight of Davis; and having made &s;ome ob&s;ervations on the face of the country, the harbours and i&s;lands, returned to Denmark. Car&s;ten Richards, being detached with two &s;hips on the &s;ame di&s;covery, de&s;cried the high land on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of Groenland; but was hindered by the ice from approaching the &s;hore.</P>
<P>Other expeditions of the &s;ame nature have been planned and executed with the &s;ame bad &s;ucce&s;s, under the au&s;pices of a Dani&s;h company of mer|chants. Two &s;hips returned from the we&s;tern part of Groenland loaded with a kind of yellow &s;and, &s;uppo&s;ed to contain a large proportion of gold. This being a&s;&s;ayed by the gold&s;miths of Copen|hagen, was condemned as u&s;ele&s;s, and thrown overboard: but from a &s;mall quantity of this &s;and, which was re&s;erved as a curio&s;ity, an expert chy|mi&s;t afterwards extracted a quantity of pure gold. The captain, who brought home this adventure, was &s;o chagrined at his di&s;appointment, that he died of grief, without having left any directions concerning the place where the &s;and had been di&s;|covered. In the year 1654, Henry Muller, a rich Dane, equipped a ve&s;&s;el under the command of David De Nelles, who &s;ailed to the we&s;t coa&s;t of Groenland, from which he carried off three women

of the country. Other efforts have been made, under the encouragement of the Dani&s;h king, for the di&s;covery and recovery of the old Iceland co|lony in Greenland: but all of them mi&s;carried, and people began to look upon &s;uch expeditions as wild and chimerical. At length the Greenland company at Bergen in Norway, tran&s;ported a co|lony to the we&s;tern coa&s;t, about the &s;ixty-fourth degree of latitude; and the&s;e Norwegians &s;ailed in the year 1712, accompanied by the reverend Hans Egede, to who&s;e care, ability, and preci|&s;ion, we owe the be&s;t and mo&s;t authentic account of modern Groenland. This gentleman endea|voured to reach the ea&s;tern di&s;trict, by coa&s;ting &s;outhwards, and advanced as far as the States Pro|montory: but the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and con|tinual &s;torms, obliged him to return; and as he could not even find the Streight of Forbi&s;her, he concluded that no &s;uch place ever exi&s;ted. In the year 1724, a &s;hip, being equipped by the com|pany, &s;ailed on this di&s;covery, with a view to land on the ea&s;t &s;ide oppo&s;ite to Iceland: but the va&s;t &s;hoals of ice, which barricadoed that part of the coa&s;t, rendered this &s;cheme impracticable. His Dani&s;h maje&s;ty, in the year 1728, cau&s;ed hor&s;es to be tran&s;ported to Greenland, in hope that the &s;et|tlers might by their means travel over land to the ea&s;tern di&s;trict; but the icy mountains were found impa&s;&s;able. Finally, lieutenant Richards, in a &s;hip which had wintered near the new Dani&s;h coiony, attempted, in his return to Denmark, to land on the ea&s;tern &s;hore; but all his endeavours proved abortive.</P>
<P>Mr. Egede is of opinion, that the only prac|ticable method of reaching that part of the coun|try, will be to coa&s;t north-about in &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, between the great flakes of ice and the &s;hore; as the Groenlanders have declared, that the currents
<PB N="27" REF="350">
continually ru&s;hing from the bays and inlets, and running &s;outh-we&s;twards along the &s;hore, hinder the ice from adhering to the land; &s;o that there is always a channel open, through which ve&s;&s;els of &s;mall burden might pa&s;s, e&s;pecially if lodges were built at convenient di&s;tances on the &s;hore, for the convenience and direction of the adventurers.</P>
<P>After this &s;hort detail of the fir&s;t di&s;covery and &s;ettlement of Groenland, the lo&s;s of that colony, and the pains that have been taken to retrieve it; we &s;hall now proceed to de&s;cribe that part of the country which is now known, vi&s;ited and &s;ettled by the Danes and Norwegians.</P>

<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>Between the &s;ixty-fourth and &s;ixty-eighth de|grees of latitude, the climate of Groenland, with re&s;pect to heat and cold, is not di&s;agreeable. In the &s;ummer, which continues from the latter end of May to the middle of September, the weather is warm and comfortable, and the &s;ky &s;erene while the wind blows ea&s;terly: nay, the heat is &s;ometimes &s;o violent, as to exhale the &s;ea-water which had been left in the hollows of the rocks, and leave a white &s;alt behind. It mu&s;t be owned, however, that the &s;ea-co&s;t is infe&s;ted with fogs, which are equally di&s;agreeable and unhealthy; and that even the &s;ummer is roughened with frequent &s;torms, which rage to an incredible degree of vio|lence: yet &s;ome &s;ea&s;ons have pa&s;&s;ed in delightful weather, without any &s;uch boi&s;terous interruption. Near the &s;hore, and in the bays and inlets, the low land is cloathed with the mo&s;t charming verdure: but the inland mountains are perpetually covered with ice and &s;now. To the northward of the &s;ix|ty-eighth degree, the cold is &s;o inten&s;e, even in &s;ummer, that &s;pirituous liquors will freeze at the fire-&s;ide. By the latter end of Augu&s;t, the &s;ea is
<PB N="28" REF="360">
covered with ice, which never thaws till April or May, and &s;ometimes remains till the latter end of June. Nothing can exhibit a more dreadful, and at the &s;ame time a more dazzling appearance than tho&s;e prodigious ma&s;&s;es of ice that &s;urround the whole coa&s;t, in the different forms of rocks, ca&s;tles, towers, and &s;pires, reflecting a variety of colours, according to the nature of the concrete, and float|ing from place to place, as if the whole &s;cene was the effect of illu&s;ion or inchantment. Such are the pro&s;pects they yield in calm weather: but when the wind begins to blow, and the &s;ea to &s;well in va&s;t &s;ucce&s;&s;ive billows, the conflict of tho&s;e con|gregated bodies of ice encountering, da&s;hing, cracking, bur&s;ting, and &s;hivering into ten thou|&s;and fragments, fills the eye and ear with terror and a&s;toni&s;hment. Thunder and lightning &s;eldom di&s;turb the air of Groenland, which however is &s;ubject to meteors of various kinds, and is in a particular manner illuminated by the <HI>Aurora Bo|realis,</HI> or northern light, &s;o little under&s;tood by natural philo&s;ophers. In the &s;pring of the year, and about the new moon, this phaenomenon gene|rally appears &s;o bright and univer&s;al over the whole face of the &s;ky, darting, gleaming, and commix|ing with inconceivable rapidity, that one may &s;ee to read by the light which it diffu&s;es. At the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice the &s;un continues all night above the horizon; and in the depth of winter he does not appear: neverthele&s;s, people have light enough to travel and work, from moon&s;hine or &s;tarlight, re|flected by the ice and &s;now with which both &s;ea and land are covered. The air of Groenland is rendered unhealthy by thick mi&s;ts and fogs in the &s;ummer, which produce di&s;ea&s;es of the brea&s;t, and the &s;curvy &s;eems to be endemial. In the winter, while the cold is exce&s;&s;ive, they are trou|bled with a fro&s;t-&s;moak, or thick vapour ri&s;ing
<PB N="29" REF="370">
from the &s;ea, &s;o acrimonious as to corrode the &s;kin of tho&s;e that approach it: this quality, however, cea&s;es as &s;oon as the per&s;on is wholly involved in the vapour, which then feels &s;oft and warm, and leaves an hoar-fro&s;t on the cloaths and hair. At the new and full moon, e&s;pecially in the &s;pring and fall, the tide upon this coa&s;t ri&s;es about three fathoms; and it is remarkable, that the &s;prings and fountains on &s;hore ri&s;e and fall with the flux and reflux of the ocean.</P>

<HEAD>SOIL: PRODUCTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;oil of Groenland varies like that of all other mountainous countries. The hills are bar|ren, and indeed frozen all the year: the vallies and low grounds, e&s;pecially towards the &s;ea, are rich and fruitful. We are informed by antient chro|nicles, that the Groenland colonies bred a great number of cattle, which produced butter and chee&s;e in &s;uch abundance, that con&s;iderable quantities of both were exported to Norway, and, on account of their peculiar excellency, &s;et apart for the king's kitchen. We read in the &s;ame hi&s;tories, that &s;ome parts of Groenland yielded the choice&s;t wheat|corn; and to this day the marks of ploughed land are ea&s;ily perceived. The &s;oil brought forth &s;tately oaks, that yielded acorns as large as apples; and &s;ome of the&s;e &s;till remain in the &s;outhern parts, near the States Promontory. The woods afforded plenty of game, &s;uch as rein-deer, hares, and par|tridges; and the bays abounded with fi&s;h for home-con&s;umption and commerce. Though at pre&s;ent this country is de&s;titute of corn and cattle, it produces in many places excellent pa&s;ture; and were it properly manured, would in all probability yield plentful crops of grain. The reverend Mr. Egede &s;owed &s;ome barley in a bay adjoining to the Dani&s;h colony, where it &s;prang up &s;o fa&s;t, that
<PB N="30" REF="380">
towards the latter end of July it was in the full ear; but being nipped by a night-fro&s;t, it never arrived at maturity. This &s;eed was brought from Bergen, where the &s;ummer is of greater heat and duration; but, in all probability, the corn which grows in the more northern parts of Norway, would thrive in Groenland, as the two climates are more congenial. Turnips and coleworts, of an excellent ta&s;te and flavour, are ea&s;ily rai&s;ed in Groenland; and the gra&s;s is remarkably rich in meadows. Among the bays and inlets there is plenty of underwood, and &s;hrubs of birch, elm, and willow, that afford &s;ufficient fuel for the inha|bitants. In the latitude of &s;ixty, the birch-trees ri&s;e to the height of two and three fathoms. Small juniper-trees grow here in abundance, and bear va&s;t quantities of large berries. The herb ange|lica &s;hoots up in every field, as well as the wild ro&s;emary, endued with the ta&s;te and flavour of turpentine: from this a fine aromatic oil and &s;pirit are extracted by di&s;tillation. The &s;ea-&s;ide is co|vered with &s;curvy-gra&s;s, agreeable to the ta&s;te, and remarkably &s;alutiferous: here al&s;o we find a &s;pecies of gra&s;s bearing yellow flowers, with a root that &s;mells in the &s;pring like ro&s;es. The &s;ides of the mountains near the bays, are cloathed with wild thyme, which, after &s;un-&s;et, diffu&s;es a fragrant odour. The herb tormentil is common in this country, as are many other plants and vegetables not yet denominated or de&s;cribed. Among the fruits of Groenland we number juniperberries, blueberries, bilberries, and brambleberries.</P>
<P>Groenland no doubt produces metals of various kinds, although no mines are actually di&s;covered and wrought in that country. There are &s;ome appearances of copper ore to the &s;outhward of the Dani&s;h colony: Mr. Egede once received a lump of ore from a Groenlander; and here he found
<PB N="31" REF="390">
calamine of a yellow colour. He &s;ent a con&s;ider|able quantity of yellow &s;and, mixed with vermi|lion &s;treaks, to the company of Bergen, who pro|bably found their account in this pre&s;ent: for they de&s;ired him, by a letter, to procure as much of that &s;and as po&s;&s;ible; but he was never able to find the place where he &s;aw the fir&s;t &s;pecimen. It was one of the &s;malle&s;t among a great clu&s;ter of i&s;lands, and the mark he had &s;et up was blown down by a &s;torm. Perhaps this was the &s;ame mineral of which &s;everal hundred tons were brought to Eng|land by Sir Martin Forbi&s;her. Groenland pro|duces rock-chry&s;tals, both red and white; and whole mountains of the a&s;be&s;tos, containing long filaments, which, when beaten and &s;eparated from the rocky dro&s;s and fragments, may be &s;pun and woven into cloth that will endure the fire, without being con&s;umed. Around the colony of Danes, which is known by the name of Good Hope, they find a kind of ba&s;tard marble of various colours, which the natives form into bowls, lamps, pots, and crucibles. In the &s;ea, be&s;ides a great variety of &s;hells, they find &s;ome beautiful trees of coral. All that has been &s;aid of the fertility of the Groen|land &s;oil, mu&s;t be under&s;tood only of that which lies between the &s;ixtieth and &s;ixty-fifth degrees of latitude: for the mo&s;t northern parts are almo&s;t de&s;titute of herbs and plants. The wretched people, who re&s;ide in this de&s;olate country, cannot find gra&s;s enough to &s;tuff into their &s;hoes, that their feet may be kept warm; but are obliged to buy it from the more &s;outhern inhabitants.</P>

<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>No toads, newts, lizards, or &s;erpents, are &s;een in Greenland; nor any in&s;ect more venomous than gnats, which however &s;warm in the &s;ummer, and are extremely trouble&s;ome. There is not even a
<PB N="32" REF="400">
ravenous animal in this country, except the great white bear, which very &s;eldom appears near the Dani&s;h colony. The quadrupeds of Groenland are the rein-deer, foxes, hares, and dogs. The rein|deer feed in great herds, and are hunted all the &s;ummer by the natives; who, in this exerci&s;e, pe|netrate to the innermo&s;t bays, and pur&s;ue the deer from place to place, accompanied by their wives and children. The hares are found in great plenty, of a white colour, very fat in &s;ummer, and of ex|qui&s;ite flavour. The Groenland foxes appear of different colours, white, grey, and blui&s;h; but &s;maller than tho&s;e of Denmark and Norway, and not &s;o hairy. Arngrim Jona, in his hi&s;tory of this country, mentions &s;ables, martens, wolves, le&s;&s;es, and ermines; but none of the&s;e animals have been &s;een by Mr. Egede. The natives are provided with a great number of dogs, large, rough, white, or &s;peckled, with ears &s;tanding upright, which is the ca&s;e with all the curs peculiar to cold climates. The Groenland dogs are timorous and &s;tupid: they neither bay nor bark, but &s;ometimes howl di&s;mal|ly. In the northern parts the natives yoke them in &s;ledges, which, though heavy laden, they will draw upon the ice at the rate of &s;eventy miles in a &s;hort winter's day. The&s;e poor animals are very ill rewarded for their &s;ervice, being left to provide for them&s;elves, except when their ma&s;ters take a great number of &s;eals: on the&s;e occa&s;ions, the dogs are regaled with the blood or entrails: at other times they &s;ub&s;i&s;t, like wild bea&s;ts, upon mu&s;cles and berries.</P>
<P>Among the land-fowls and birds of Groenland, we reckon a kind of large partridges, white in winter, and grey in &s;ummer, which are found in great abundance; &s;parrows, &s;now-birds, ice-birds, and a kind of linnet that warbles very melodiou&s;ly. Ravens, in great numbers, are &s;een continually
<PB N="33" REF="410">
about the huts of the Groenlanders, hovering over the carca&s;es of the &s;eals, with which the ground is commonly &s;trewed. Here are al&s;o eagles of a pro|digious &s;ize, faulcons of different colours, and large &s;peckled owls. Of the in&s;ect &s;pecies there are &s;piders, flies, humble-bees, and wa&s;ps; but neither frogs, beetles, nor ants: neither are the people plagued with rats, mice, or any &s;uch ver|mine.</P>

<HEAD>SEA-ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ea of Groenland teems with the &s;ame &s;pe|cies of animals which have been already de&s;cribed in the article of Spitzbergen. Here we find the whale, the fin-whale, the north-cape whale, and the cachelot, or pot-fi&s;h, that yields the <HI>&s;perma ceti;</HI> the unicorn, the &s;word-fi&s;h, the white-fi&s;h, the but-head, the hay, and porcpi&s;ce.</P>
<P>It may be ob&s;erved, that the whale is furni&s;hed with a bunch on the back-part of his head, per|forated with two openings parallel to each other, through which he &s;ucks in the air, and &s;pouts out the water. The <HI>penis</HI> of the male is a &s;trong &s;inew, from eight to fourteen feet in length, ac|cording to the &s;ize of the fi&s;h, included in a &s;heath or cap&s;ula. The parts of generation proper to the female, re&s;emble tho&s;e of quadrupeds: &s;he has two brea&s;ts furni&s;hed with teats, like a cow, at which &s;he &s;uckles her young; and never brings forth above two at a time. The whale's food chiefly con&s;i&s;ts of the <HI>pulmo marinus,</HI> a &s;ort of blub|ber re&s;embling a jelly, with two brims or flaps; but, in fact, an animal of the polypus kind, that moves &s;lowly on the &s;urface of the water. The &s;ea of Groenland abounds with this &s;ub&s;tance, which is counted a dainty to the whale; though he feeds occa&s;ionally on in&s;ects and &s;mall fi&s;h. The north-cape whale, &s;o called becau&s;e he appears
<PB N="34" REF="420">
generally on the northern coa&s;t of Norway, has been found to have above a tun of herrings in his belly. The cachelot, or pot-fi&s;h, differs from other whales in many particulars: his &s;cull is larger and &s;tronger; his &s;pouts are placed on the forehead; his lower jaw is armed with teeth; his tongue is thin, pointed, and of a yellowi&s;h colour: he has but one eye, fixed on the &s;ide of the head; &s;o that he is ea&s;y of acce&s;s to the Groenlanders, who attack him on his blind &s;ide. The <HI>&s;perma ceti</HI> is prepared from the oil of his head, of which one fi&s;h will yield from twenty to four and twenty tons. The length of the cachelot is from &s;ixty to &s;eventy feet. The fle&s;h of the white-fi&s;h, when pickled with vinegar and &s;alt, is as well ta&s;ted as pork; and the fins, with the tail, when prepared in the &s;ame manner, are counted delicious eating. The&s;e fi&s;h are from twelve to &s;ixteen feet long, of a yellow colour, and are taken in great numbers by the inhabitants of Groenland. The butt, or blunt-head, &s;o called from the form of its &s;nout, is of the &s;ame &s;ize, furni&s;hed with one air-pipe on the hinder part of the head: he follows &s;hips under &s;ail, as if he vied with them in &s;wiftne&s;s; and is one of tho&s;e fi&s;hes that tumble before a &s;torm.</P>
<P>The &s;ea-unicorn we have already de&s;cribed; and the porcpi&s;ce, or porpoi&s;e, is &s;o univer&s;ally known, that it &s;carce needs any de&s;cription.</P>
<P>This coa&s;t likewi&s;e abounds with the mor&s;e, which is &s;o fierce and courageous, that he will maintain a battle with the great white bear, and &s;ometimes obtains the victory, by means of his mighty tu&s;ks. The&s;e animals frequently fight to|gether until both expire.</P>
<P>Of the merman, mermaid, kranken, marmel, and other &s;ea-mon&s;ters and phantoms, we &s;hall treat at large in our account of Norway. But of all the animals upon this coa&s;t, that which chiefly
<PB N="35" REF="430">
contributes to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and convenience of the natives, is the &s;eal. There are different &s;orts of this creature; but the mo&s;t remarkable is the <HI>clap-my&s;s,</HI> &s;o called from a cap or cowl with which he covers his head occa&s;ionally. The &s;eal's head re&s;embles that of a dog with cropped ears: his &s;nout is bearded like a cat; his eyes are large, and his teeth &s;harp: his &s;kin is covered with a &s;hort thick fur, white, black, brown, or tawny: he is web-footed, for the convenience of &s;wimming; and &s;eems to drag him&s;elf along, rather than to walk: his &s;ize is from five to eight feet in length; and his fat yields better train-oil than that of any other &s;ea-animal. The Groenlanders feed on the fle&s;h of this creature: the &s;kin &s;erves them as cloaths for their bodies, and covering for their boats and tents; and the fat they not only burn in their lamps for light, but al&s;o u&s;e for fuel to cook their provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>Mr. Egede declares, that, in the year 1734, the &s;ea-&s;erpent was &s;een off the new Dani&s;h colony, and rai&s;ed its head ma&s;t-high above the &s;urface of the &s;ea. For further particulars relating to this prodigious animal, &s;ee our account of Norway.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the fi&s;h already mentioned, the Groen|land &s;eas abound with holybut, turbut, cod, had|dock, &s;cate, and &s;mall &s;almon, which la&s;t are found very fat and well-flavoured in all inlets and mouths of rivers. The natives chiefly feed on cat-fi&s;h, of which there is great plenty, both in winter and &s;ummer. In the month of April they catch abun|dance of the roe-fi&s;h, called rogneals, or &s;tone|biter; and in May great numbers of lyds or &s;tents. Both the&s;e are good and &s;avoury, and frequent the bays in prodigious &s;hoals. Here too we find abundance of whiting, and a fi&s;h re&s;embling a bream, with prickles all over its body, counted good eating: but no herrings vi&s;it this coa&s;t.</P>

Among the te&s;taceous fi&s;hes of Groenland, we find large delicate mu&s;&s;els in great quantities, &s;ome of them containing &s;mall pearls of no great value. The &s;hore al&s;o produces crabs and &s;hrimps; but neither crawfi&s;h nor oy&s;ters. On the &s;outhern coa&s;t the inhabitants are &s;aid to have taken &s;ome tortoi&s;es; but this creature can hardly be deemed a native of the Groenland &s;eas.</P>

<HEAD>SEA-BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>The principal &s;ea-fowl of Groenland, is the edder|fowl, which &s;warms in &s;uch numbers, that they &s;eem to cover the whole &s;urface of the ocean. In the winter they hover about the Dani&s;h colony in myriads; &s;tanding in for the bay every evening, and taking their flight to &s;eaward in the morning. In the &s;pring they retire to the i&s;lands that &s;ur|round the coa&s;t, in order to lay their eggs, and hatch their young; and afterwards return to the main land in the months of June and July. The natives rob them of their eggs and young; but ignorantly leave in the ne&s;ts the fine down-feathers, &s;o much valued in other countries. Of the duck &s;pecies, there are three &s;orts common to this cli|mate: one re&s;embles the tame duck in its broad bill, and is adorned with a fine &s;peckled plumage. This creature, as well as the edder-fowl, builds upon the i&s;lands. The &s;econd &s;ort is of a &s;maller &s;ize, with a long pointed bill, re&s;iding chiefly in bays and fre&s;h waters, where they hatch among the reeds. The third &s;pecies is called the wood|duck, re&s;embling the fir&s;t, though larger in &s;ize, with a black brea&s;t and a grey body. The&s;e ani|mals are &s;aid to deviate from the common cour&s;e of generation, and to be produced from a &s;limy matter in the &s;ea, which adheres to old pieces of &s;loating wood: of this a kind of mu&s;&s;el is gene|rated, in which is bred a little maggot or worm,

that, in proce&s;s of time, is formed into a bird. Such a theory of propagation will, by the &s;en&s;ible part of mankind, be always rejected as unphilo&s;o|phical and ab&s;urd. There is another &s;ea-fowl called alkes, which, in the winter &s;ea&s;on, the Groenlanders drive in large flocks to the &s;hore, where they catch them with their hands, and kill them for provi&s;ion. This bird is not &s;o large as the duck, and the fle&s;h is oily and rancid: there is, however, a &s;maller kind of the &s;ame &s;pecies, much more palatable. The mo&s;t beautiful bird on this coa&s;t re&s;embles a lark in &s;ize and form; but is arrayed in very gorgeous feathers, and known by the natives under the name of <HI>tungo|viar&s;eck.</HI> The northern parts of Groenland abound with wild gee&s;e, which come hither from more &s;outhern climates in the &s;pring to breed, and re|turn to them again in the beginning of winter. Among the &s;ea-fowl of Groenland we likewi&s;e number all kinds of &s;ea-mews, that build in the clifts of the highe&s;t rocks; the bird called terne, which lays its eggs on the i&s;lands, where they are found among the &s;tones in great abundance; the lundes, or Groenland parrot, &s;o called on account of its &s;peckled bill and beauteous plumage; the &s;ea-emms, a large fowl with very &s;mall wings; and great plenty of &s;nipes. Here are many others common to different countries, and &s;ome peculiar to Groenland, which have not yet been denomi|nated or de&s;cribed.</P>

found a &s;trong affinity between the cu&s;toms of different nations living in the &s;ame kind of cli|mate, expo&s;ed to the &s;ame wants and nece&s;&s;ities, and involved in the &s;ame ignorance and brutality. The Groenlanders are &s;hort, brawny, and inclined to corpulency, with broad faces, flat no&s;es, thick lips, black hair and eyes, and a yellowi&s;h tawny complexion. They are, for the mo&s;t part, vigor|ous and healthy, but remarkably &s;hort-lived; few of them reaching the grand climacterick, and many dying in their infancy, and in the prime of youth. They are &s;ubject to a weakne&s;s in the eyes, occa&s;ioned by the &s;harp and piercing winds, as well as by the white glare reflected from the ice and &s;now with which the whole country is covered. The lepro&s;y is likewi&s;e known among them, but not contagious. Tho&s;e that dwell in the northern parts are mi&s;erably plagued with dy&s;enteries, rheums, and pulmonary di&s;orders, boils and epi|lep&s;y. The &s;mall-pox, being imported among them from Copenhagen in the year 1734, made terrible havock among tho&s;e poor people, who are the more to be pitied when under the hand of di&s;|temper, as they are utterly ignorant of medicine, and intirely depend upon the &s;pells of their <HI>ange|kuts,</HI> or conjurers. When they chance to be hurt, they &s;ew or &s;titch up the wound. They even pre|&s;ume to cure blindne&s;s, by pulling off the film from the eye, with a hook, needle, or knife. When a child is troubled with worms, the mother is &s;aid to &s;uck them out by the <HI>anus.</HI> The inner|mo&s;t rind of a tree, or burned mo&s;s, mixed with train-oil, is counted a &s;pecific plai&s;ter for the mo&s;t dangerous wounds.</P>
<P>The Groenlanders are in their di&s;po&s;itions cold, phlegmatic, indolent, and &s;low of apprehen&s;ion; but very quiet, orderly, and good-natured. Though they are &s;ubject to no laws, or regular di&s;cipline,

they live peaceably together like brothers, with|out envy, &s;trife, or animo&s;ity. If a murder &s;hould be committed, which is very &s;eldom the ca&s;e, no cognizance is taken of the murderer, unle&s;s the neare&s;t kin&s;man of the decea&s;ed thinks proper to revenge his death. They think it is meritorious to kill tho&s;e old women who pretend to be witches, becau&s;e they are &s;uppo&s;ed to do mi&s;chief by their conjurations. Far from &s;tealing from one another, they look upon theft with abhorrence; and, indeed, have every thing in common: but they are not &s;o &s;crupulous with re&s;pect to &s;trangers, whom they think it is no crime to pillage. Fornication is al|together unknown among the&s;e &s;avages, except upon &s;ome occa&s;ions, when they are permitted to conver&s;e with each other's wives promi&s;cuou&s;ly. They are, in general, mode&s;t, civil, and ho&s;pitable; but &s;lovenly, even to a degree of bea&s;tline&s;s. The men never wa&s;h them&s;elves; but, in imitation of the cat, lick their fingers, with which they rub off the &s;alt &s;pray which the &s;ea throws into their faces and eyes: they even lick up the &s;weat, which they &s;crape from their faces with knives. They eat after their dogs, without clean&s;ing their bowls and platters; and do not &s;cruple to devour the lice, and other vermin, which they find on their own bodies. The women wa&s;h them&s;elves in their own urine, which, in their opinion, cau&s;es the hair to grow, and diffu&s;es a fragrant odour all around them. A virgin, thus be&s;prinkled and perfumed, is complimented with the epithet <HI>niviar&s;iar &s;ua|nerks,</HI> implying, maiden &s;weetne&s;s; and &s;he goes out into the cold air, to let the urine freeze upon the &s;urface of her &s;kin. They u&s;e no ceremony in complying with the calls of nature, which they obey without &s;cruple in the mid&s;t of company; and every family is &s;upplied with an urine tub, placed before the entry, for the u&s;e of every indi|vidual.

The contents of this precious re&s;ervoir are kept until they become intolerably offen&s;ive, and the &s;mell is reinforced by raw &s;kins &s;oaked in this tub for dre&s;&s;ing: if we add the &s;cent ari&s;ing from pieces of corrupted fle&s;h and fat, thrown carele&s;ly under the benches, the reader will own that nothing can be le&s;s delicate than a Groen|lander's habitation. The&s;e people, both men and women, are dre&s;&s;ed in garments made of the &s;kins of &s;eals and rein-deer; and, by way of finery, they &s;ometimes wear jackets of birds &s;kin, nicely prepared. The man wears a coat reaching down to the knees, with the hairy &s;ide of the &s;kin turned inwards for warmth; and to this coat or jacket is &s;ewed a cap or hood, to cover the head and &s;houl|ders. The breeches and &s;tockings are made of the &s;ame &s;tuff, and their boots of &s;eal-&s;kin, well tanned and nicely wrought. Over the jacket he puts on a large frock of dre&s;&s;ed &s;eal-&s;kin, to keep out the water: between the frock and the under|coat he &s;ometimes u&s;es a &s;hirt of linnen, or of &s;eal|guts, the better to defend him from the water. Since their communication with the Danes, how|ever, the Groenlanders &s;ometimes appear in linnen &s;hirts, cloth coats and breeches; but &s;till fa&s;hioned according to their own mode: they likewi&s;e pur|cha&s;e coar&s;e wor&s;ted &s;tockings of various colours. There is no great difference between the dre&s;s of the man and the woman in Groenland. The fe|males wear wider and longer coats, for the conve|nience of carrying their infants at their backs, wrapped up in the &s;kirts of them; for they u&s;e neither cradles nor &s;waddling cloaths. Their drawers reach to the middle of the thigh; but their breeches come down to the knees. Next to the body they wear wai&s;tcoats made of fawns &s;kin, with the hair inwards.

Their necks, arms, and ears, they adorn with beads, corals, pendants, and bracelets of black &s;kin &s;et with pearls. With the &s;ame view they &s;tain their fore|heads, chins, arms, legs, and thighs with black &s;treaks, indented in the &s;kin by means of a needle and coloured thread. The women are hard fa|voured, &s;lutti&s;h, and filthy, e&s;pecially tho&s;e wives who have borne children, becau&s;e they know they cannot be repudiated by their hu&s;bands. The Groenlanders feed upon the fle&s;h of rein-deer, whales, &s;eals, hares, partridges, and all &s;orts of &s;ea-fowl. Their fle&s;h-meat they &s;ometimes eat raw, and &s;ometimes boiled or dried in the &s;un and wind. Their fi&s;h is always thoroughly boiled, or well dried: thus they pre&s;erve their &s;almon, roe|fi&s;h, holybut, and &s;mall &s;tents: the&s;e they catch in the months of May and June, and pre&s;erve for winter provi&s;ion, as the &s;eals are not ea&s;ily taken in the &s;evere &s;ea&s;on, except in the northern parts, where they are killed on the ice. The inhabitants likewi&s;e provide &s;tore of the&s;e animals in the &s;um|mer, and bury them under the &s;now; from whence they are dug out frozen in the winter, to be eaten without any farther preparation. Their drink is the &s;imple element, cooled with lumps of ice and &s;now. They never clean&s;e their kettles, pots, or di&s;hes; but eat their victuals off the dirty ground, and devour rotten fle&s;h with the utmo&s;t avidity. They have no &s;et meals, but occa&s;ionally obey the calls of appetite; except at their return from &s;ea, when they indulge them&s;elves with a plentiful &s;up|per: even then the women eat &s;eparately by them|&s;elves. In times of &s;carcity the Groenlanders will &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon pieces of old &s;kin, reeds, &s;ea-weed,

The dung of rein-deer, taken from the inte&s;tines, the intrails of partridges, and all &s;orts of offal, are counted dainties among the&s;e &s;avages; and of the &s;crapings of &s;eal-&s;kins they make deli|cate pancakes. In &s;ummer they u&s;e wood for fuel to cook their victuals: in winter they boil them over the flame of their lamps in &s;mall kettles, manufactured by them&s;elves, of bra&s;s, copper, or marble. Their fires, when extingui&s;hed, they re|kindle by the friction of a piece of hard wood upon a block of dried fir-tree.</P>
<P>The Groenlanders at fir&s;t could not ta&s;te the Dani&s;h provi&s;ions without marks of abhorrence; but now they are become extremely fond of bread and butter: yet they &s;till retain their aver&s;ion to &s;pirituous liquors and tobacco; in this particular differing from the Laplanders and Samoiedes. A Groenlander commonly contents him&s;elf with one wife; though a great number is indulged to he|roes, and extraordinary per&s;onages; and the hu&s;|band enjoys the prerogative of repudiating at his plea&s;ure. The&s;e people are &s;o far from being jea|lous, that, at &s;ome of their fe&s;tivals, in the mid&s;t of their fea&s;ting and revelry, a man retires with his neighbour's wife behind a curtain made of &s;kins; and all the gue&s;ts, thus coupled, withdraw in their turns. The&s;e privileges, however, are enjoyed by married per&s;ons only; and he is ac|counted the be&s;t man, who, with the be&s;t grace, can oblige his friend in this manner. The married women think them&s;elves happy if an angekut, or prophet, will honour them with his care&s;&s;es. The young women are remarkably cha&s;te and ba&s;hful; though &s;ometimes their mode&s;ty is overcome, and they give way to the frailty of human nature. The&s;e people never marry within the prohibited degrees of con&s;anguinity; nor is it counted decent

in a couple to marry, who have been educated to|gether in the &s;ame family. The form of their marriages is very &s;imple: the man propo&s;es the match to the parents or relations of the female, and, having obtained their con&s;ent, goes to fetch the bride, accompanied and a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two old women. The young woman is obliged, for de|cency's &s;ake, to &s;truggle; and, when brought by force to the hou&s;e of the bridegroom, &s;its retired in a corner, with her hair di&s;hevelled, and cover|ing her face as if &s;he were a&s;hamed. Mean while the man u&s;es all his eloquence and addre&s;s in per|&s;uading her to comply with his wi&s;hes: the good creature, melted by his rhetoric, yields at length, and the con&s;ummation immediately en&s;ues. If the bridegroom's father is wealthy, he fea&s;ts his neigh|bours on this occa&s;ion, and entertains them with a variety of games, throwing out poles, rafts, knives, and toys, by way of prizes, to the winners. The Groenland wives &s;ubmit to cha&s;ti&s;ement from their hu&s;bands with great re&s;ignation; but they never correct their children or &s;ervants. <Q>As &s;oon as a child is born, the mother, dipping her finger in water, rubs the infant's lips; or putting a bit of &s;now in its mouth, pronounces the word <HI>imo|kautit,</HI> &s;ignifying &startq;thou ha&s;t drank a good deal.&endq;</Q> <Q>In eating, &s;he rubs the child's mouth with a bit of fi&s;h, &s;aying, <HI>aiparpotit,</HI> i. e. &startq;Thou ha&s;t eaten, and kept me company.&endq;</Q> The umbilical cord is either cut with a mu&s;&s;el-&s;hell, or bit off with the teeth, and carefully pre&s;erved as an amulet. When the child is a year old, the mother licks and &s;lab|bers it all over, in order to render it the more &s;trong and hardy. While a woman is in labour, the go&s;&s;ips hold a chamber-pot over her head, as a charm to ha&s;ten the delivery. The child being born, the mother is &s;wathed round the belly with a broad belt, and next day returns to her wonted

occupation. She always carries her child at her back, wrapped up in the &s;kirt of her coat, even when &s;he is at labour, and &s;uckles it to the third or fourth year. Very little education is be&s;towed upon the children, who naturally follow the ex|ample of their parents; and, even after marriage, dwell in the &s;ame hou&s;e with the re&s;t of their fa|mily. When a Groenlander dies, the relations throw all his uten&s;ils, furniture, and cloaths into the field, as impure and unpropitious. All who live in the &s;ame hou&s;e are al&s;o obliged to carry out their effects, which, however, are brought back in the evening, as by that time they imagine the effluvia from the dead body are intirely di&s;&s;ipated. They mourn for the defunct with tears and hideous howling: they bury him under a heap of &s;tones, dre&s;&s;ed in his be&s;t apparel, with his legs bent un|der his back, and well wrapped up in the &s;kins of &s;eals and rein-deer. Near the place of interment they depo&s;ite the uten&s;ils and implements that be|longed to the decea&s;ed, whether male or female; le&s;t, by their being kept at home, they &s;hould recal the remembrance of their departed friend, and con&s;equently renew their &s;orrow and affliction.

Their &s;ongs are &s;atirical ballads, &s;ung extempore at their a&s;&s;em|blies, and accompanied with a kind of drum beaten by the &s;inger, who performs very &s;trange ge&s;ticu|lations at the &s;ame time for the entertainment of the company. When any per&s;on thinks him&s;elf injured by his neighbour, in&s;tead of fighting with the arm of fle&s;h, he challenges the party to bandy &s;atire with him in public, and his antagoni&s;t pre|pares for the conte&s;t, which is always decided in favour of him who can the longe&s;t per&s;evere in this kind of altercation.</P>
<P>The Groenlanders are employed all the year either in fi&s;hing or hunting. Their game at &s;ea con&s;i&s;ts of whales, mor&s;es, &s;eals, fi&s;h for eating, and &s;ea-fowl. On &s;hore they hunt the rein-deer, in different parts of the country: for this purpo&s;e they and their families penetrate into the interior parts of the bay, where the&s;e animals feed in large herds. There they are driven into a narrow circle, or defile, by the cries and &s;houts of the Groen|landers, and, thus &s;traitened, are ea&s;ily killed with arrows. Their bow is made of fir-tree, wound about with the twi&s;ted &s;inews of animals: the &s;tring is compo&s;ed of the &s;ame &s;tuff, or of &s;eal-&s;kin: the arrow is a good fathom in length, pointed with a bearded iron, or a &s;harp-pointed bone; but tho&s;e they kill birds with, are blunt at the head, that they may not tear the fle&s;h of the game. Sea-fowls they &s;hoot with lances, which they throw at a great di&s;tance with &s;urpri&s;ing dex|terity. Their manner of catching whales is quite different from that practi&s;ed by other Europeans. About fifty per&s;ons, men and women, &s;et out in
<PB N="46" REF="550">
one long boat, which is called a kone-boat, from <HI>kone,</HI> a woman, becau&s;e it is rowed by females only. When they find a whale, they &s;trike him with har|poons; to which are fa&s;tened, with long lines, &s;ome blown &s;eal-&s;kins, filled with wind like blad|ders. The&s;e, by floating on the &s;urface, not only di&s;cover the track of the whale, but hinder him from diving under water for any length of time. They continue to pur&s;ue him; and when he is fa|tigued, or lo&s;es &s;trength, they renew their attack with &s;pears and lances, until he expires. On this occa&s;ion they are clad in their &s;pring-coats, con|&s;i&s;ting of one piece, with gloves, boots, and caps made of &s;eal-&s;kins, &s;o tightly laced and &s;ewed to|gether as to keep out the water. Thus accoutred, they leap into the &s;ea, and begin to &s;lice off the fat, even under water, before the whale is dead; nay, &s;ometimes they are &s;o bold as to mount upon his back, and &s;carify him while he is &s;till alive. They have many different ways of killing &s;eals; namely, by &s;triking them with a &s;maller harpoon, equipped al&s;o with an air-bag: by watching them when they come to breathe at the air-holes in the ice, and &s;triking them with &s;pears: by approach|ing them in the di&s;gui&s;e of their own &s;pecies, that is, covered with a &s;eal-&s;kin, creeping upon the ice, and moving the head from &s;ide to &s;ide, ac|cording to the manner of this animal: by &s;uch a &s;tratagem the Groenlander moves towards the un|&s;u&s;pecting &s;eal, and kills him with a &s;pear. Be|fore the &s;now falls, the natives can &s;ee the &s;eals through the ice, and follow their cour&s;e to the fir&s;t opening, where they are ea&s;ily killed: they are likewi&s;e &s;urpri&s;ed while they ba&s;k them&s;elves in the &s;un, either upon rocks or floating pieces of ice. The Groenlanders angle with lines made of whale-bone, cut very &s;mall, by means of which they &s;ucceed wonderfully: but the holybut is
<PB N="47" REF="560">
caught with lines of hemp, or &s;eal-&s;kin. The &s;mall &s;almon and roe-fi&s;h they take in little wares, or &s;tone inclo&s;ures, which the fi&s;h enter with the flood, and at low water are left upon dry land. The lad, or &s;tent-fi&s;h, which they open and dry upon the rocks for winter provi&s;ion, are caught in va&s;t &s;hoals by &s;ieves fixed to the end of long poles. The&s;e the natives eat with melted fat, or train-oil. The Groenland canoe, like that u&s;ed in Nova Zembla and Hud&s;on's Bay, is about three fathoms in length, pointed at both ends, three quarters of a yard in breadth, compo&s;ed of thin rafts fa&s;tened together with the &s;inews of animals, covered with dre&s;&s;ed &s;eal-&s;kins, both below and above, in &s;uch a manner, that a circular hole is left in the middle, large enough to admit the body of one man. Into this the Groenlander thru&s;ts him&s;elf up to the wai&s;te, and fa&s;tens the &s;kin &s;o tight about him, that no water can enter. Thus &s;ecured, and armed with a &s;hort paddle broad at both ends, he will venture out to &s;ea, in the mo&s;t &s;tormy weather, to catch &s;eals and &s;ea-fowl; and if he is over&s;et, he can ea&s;ily rai&s;e him&s;elf by means of his paddle. A Groenlander, in one of the&s;e canoes, which was brought with him to Copenhagen, out&s;tripped a pinnace of &s;ixteen oars, manned with choice ma|riners. The kone-boat is made of the &s;ame mate|rials; but more durable, and &s;o large as to con|tain fifty per&s;ons, with all their tackle, baggage, and provi&s;ions. She is fitted with a ma&s;t, which carries a triangular &s;ail, made of the membranes and intrails of &s;eals, and managed without the help of braces and bowlings.

their hou&s;es, while the men employ them&s;elves wholly in preparing their hunting implements and fi&s;hing-tackle. This country is but thinly inha|bited. During the winter &s;ea&s;on the people live in low huts, built of &s;tone and turf: on one &s;ide are the windows covered with the tran&s;parent membranes of &s;eals and holybuts, to admit the light: on the other &s;tand their beds or benches, on which they lie covered with the &s;kins of &s;eals and rein-deer. Several families live in one of the&s;e hou&s;es, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing each a &s;eparate apartment, before which is a hearth, with a great lamp placed on a trevit, over which hangs their kettle: above is a rack or &s;helf, on which their wet clothes are dried. They burn train oil in their lamps, and, in&s;tead of wick, u&s;e a kind of dry mo&s;s, which very well an&s;wers the purpo&s;e: the&s;e fires are not only &s;ufficient to boil their victuals, but likewi&s;e produce &s;uch a heat, that the whole hou&s;e is as warm as a bagnio. The door is very low, that as little cold air as po&s;&s;ible may be admitted. The hou&s;e within is lined with old &s;kins, and &s;ur|rounded with benches for the convenience of the family, as well as of &s;trangers. When the men and women &s;it at work on the&s;e benches, they turn their backs to each other. In the &s;ummer they dwell in tents, made of long poles fixed in a conical form, covered with deer-&s;kins internally, and outwardly with &s;eal-&s;kins dre&s;&s;ed, &s;o as that the rain cannot pierce them. Every ma&s;ter of a family is provided with a tent, and a kone-boat to tran&s;port his luggage from place to place, accord|ing to his occa&s;ions.</P>

<HEAD>LANGUAGE. RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>All the Groenlanders, hitherto known, &s;peak the &s;ame language, though different dialects pre|vail in different di&s;tricts. It abounds with double
<PB N="49" REF="580">
con&s;onants; and is &s;o guttural, that the pronun|ciation of many words is not to be learned, ex|cept by tho&s;e who&s;e organs have been accu&s;tomed to it from their infancy. The letters C, D, F, Q, X, are not known in their alphabet. Like the North Americans, they have a great number of long poly&s;yllables. Their words, verbs as well as nouns, are inflected at the end by varying the ter|minations, without the help of articles; but their language being found defective, they have adopted a good number of words from the Norwegian dialect. Notwith&s;tanding the pious endeavours of the chri&s;tian mi&s;&s;ionaries from Denmark, they have no great rea&s;on to boa&s;t of the pro&s;elytes they have made among the natives of Groenland. The&s;e &s;avages pay great deference and re&s;pect to the Danes, whom, indeed, they obey as their ma&s;|ters; and hear the truths of the chri&s;tian religion expounded, without doubting the veracity of their teachers: but, at the &s;ame time, they li&s;ten with the mo&s;t mortifying indifference, without retaining the lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion of the Go&s;pel. Though many have &s;uffered them&s;elves to be in&s;tructed and bap|tized, they &s;eem altogether unaffected by the &s;ub|lime doctrine and my&s;teries of their new religion, and continue &s;till &s;lavi&s;hly bigotted to the ab&s;urdi|ties of their antient &s;uper&s;tition. They believe in the immortality of the &s;oul, and in the exi&s;tence of a &s;pirit called Torngar&s;uk; of which, however, they have formed the mo&s;t ridiculous ideas. The Angekuts, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to be his immediate mini&s;ters, differ in their opinions concerning his principles. One &s;ays he is without form or &s;hape: another affirms, that he a&s;&s;umes the likene&s;s of a bear: a third pretends he has a large body, and but one arm; and, according to a fourth, he is no larger than a man's finger. Some hold him to be immortal, and others declare he may be killed

by an eruption of wind backwards. He is &s;aid to re&s;ide in the lower regions of the earth, or in the water. They likewi&s;e believe in a &s;pirit that in|habits the air, called <HI>Innirirrirfok,</HI> or the Re|&s;trainer, becau&s;e he is &s;uppo&s;ed, by the mouth of the Angekuts, to re&s;train people from certain kinds of food, or actions that might be attended with mi&s;chievous con&s;equences. They adore an|other &s;pirit re&s;ident in the air, which they deno|minate <HI>Erlocr&s;ortok,</HI> &s;ignifying a gutter, becau&s;e he is thought to gut the dead, and feed on their inte&s;tines. He is repre&s;ented as having a lean meagre body, haggard, hollow eyes, and a gha&s;tly countenance. According to their mythology, all the elements are filled with &s;pirits; from among which every Angekut is &s;upplied with a familiar, called <HI>Torngak,</HI> who is always ready when &s;um|moned to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The per&s;on who a&s;pires to the office of Angekut, retires to &s;ome unfre|quented place, where he invokes the &s;pirit Torn|gar&s;uk; which appears to him in &s;uch a terrible form, that he &s;ickens, &s;woons, dies, and conti|nues bereft of life for three days: then he revives, and returns to his own home, in&s;pired by the &s;pirit of conjuration. The&s;e impo&s;tors pretend to cure di&s;ea&s;es by &s;pells and charms; to commune with the god Torngar&s;uk, and promulgate his commands; to vi&s;it heaven occa&s;ionally, and de|&s;cend to the court of Torngar&s;uk in the lower regions. In a word, they play a thou&s;and jug|gling tricks to puzzle and deceive their poor ig|norant fellow-creatures, over whom they acquire &s;uch influence, that they act with the mo&s;t de&s;potic authority, both as prie&s;ts and legi&s;lators. It would be tedious, and unentertaining, to recount all the ridiculous fables which the&s;e Angekuts have in|vented for the purpo&s;es of deceit, concerning the creation of man, the origin of fi&s;hes, the &s;tate of

<P>THE North Cape, antiently called <HI>Rutu|bae Promontorium,</HI> &s;ituated in the i&s;land of Maggero, about five degrees and a half beyond the Polar Circle, is the farthe&s;t extremity of Norway, inhabited by the Finmarks or Laplanders, a &s;avage people, to whom Nature &s;eems to have acted as a &s;evere &s;tep-mother; whether we con&s;ider their external form, their brutality, their want of nece&s;&s;a|ries, or their &s;ituation amid&s;t dreary mountains, woods, and de&s;erts covered with the keene&s;t fro&s;t and drifting &s;nows in the winter, and &s;warm|ing in the &s;ummer with myriads of vermin, much more intolerable than all the horrors of inten&s;e cold and famine. As the country, which the&s;e wretched people inhabit, is divided into three &s;eparate portions, appended to the dominions of Denmark, Sweden, and Ru&s;&s;ia, we &s;hall in&s;ert a particular account of them in the article of Swedi&s;h Lapland, and begin our work with a de|&s;cription of the other parts of Norway, inhabited by a different nation.</P>

<HEAD>SITUATION.</HEAD>
<P>Norway lies between the fifty-&s;eventh and &s;e|venty-&s;econd degrees of north latitude, and between the fifth and thirty-fir&s;t degrees of longitude, ea&s;t from London; extending in length about one thou&s;and miles, in a direct line from Linde&s;naes, in the dioce&s;e of Chri&s;tian&s;and, to the North Cape, at the extremity of Finmark. Its breadth, from the frontiers of Sweden we&s;tward to Cape Statt, may amount to about three hundred miles; but from thence the country becomes gradually nar|rower towards the north. On the &s;outh it is bounded by the Schagen-rack, or Categate, the entrance into the Baltic: on the ea&s;t it is divided from Sweden by a long ridge of high mountains; and on the we&s;t and north it is wa&s;hed by the northern ocean.</P>
<P>The coa&s;t of Norway, extending above three hundred leagues, is &s;tudded with a multitude of &s;mall i&s;lands, affording habitation to fi&s;hermen and pilots, and pa&s;ture to a few cattle. They form an infinite number of narrow channels, and a natural barrier of rocks, which renders Norway inacce&s;&s;ible to the naval power of its enemies. Attempts of this kind are the more dangerous, as the &s;hore is generally bold, &s;teep, and impending; &s;o that clo&s;e to the rocks the depth of the &s;ea amounts to one, two, or three hundred fathoms. The perils of the north &s;ea are moreover increa&s;ed by &s;udden &s;torms, &s;unk rocks, violent currents, and dreadful whirlpools. The mo&s;t remarkable vortex on this coa&s;t is called Mo&s;koe&s;trom, from the &s;mall i&s;land Mo&s;koe, belonging to the di&s;trict of Lofoden, in the province of Nordland. In time of flood, the &s;tream runs up between Lofoden and Mo&s;koe with the mo&s;t boi&s;terous rapidity; but in its ebb to the &s;ea, it roars like a thou&s;and cataracts, &s;o as to be
<PB N="54" REF="630">
heard at the di&s;tance of many leagues. The &s;ur|face exhibits different vortices; and if in one of the&s;e any &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el is ab&s;orbed, it is whirled down to the bottom, and da&s;hed in pieces again&s;t the rocks. The&s;e violent whirlpools continue with|out intervals, except for a quarter of an hour, at high and low water, in calm weather; for the boiling gradually returns as the flood or ebb ad|vances. When its fury is heightened by a &s;torm, no ve&s;&s;el ought to venture within a league of it. Whales have been frequently ab&s;orbed within the vortex, and howled and bellowed hideou&s;ly in their fruitle&s;s endeavours to di&s;engage them&s;elves. A bear, in attempting to &s;wim from Lofoden to Mo&s;koe, was once hurried into this whirlpool, from whence he &s;truggled in vain for deliverance, roar|ing &s;o loud as to be heard on &s;hore; but, notwith|&s;tanding all his efforts, he was borne down and de|&s;troyed. Large trees being ab&s;orbed by the cur|rent, are &s;ucked down, and ri&s;e again all &s;hattered into &s;plinters. There are three vortices of the &s;ame kind near the i&s;lands of Ferroe.</P>

<HEAD>DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>Norway is divided into the four governments of Aggerhus, Bergen, Drontheim, and Wardhus, be|&s;ides that of Bahus, which is now &s;ubject to Sweden. The province of Aggerhus comprehends the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of Norway, extending in length about three hundred miles. Its chief towns are Chri&s;tia|nia, the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan to the metropo|litan &s;ee of Drontheim, where the &s;overeign court of ju&s;tice is held, in pre&s;ence of the viceroy, and the governor of the province; Aggerhus, about fifteen miles to the &s;outh-we&s;t of Chri&s;tiania; Fre|derick&s;hall, or Frederick&s;tadt, in the &s;iege of which Charles XII. of Sweden lo&s;t his life by a cannon|ball;
<PB N="55" REF="640">
Saltzberg, Ton&s;berg, Alleen, Hammar, and Hollen.</P>
<P>The government of Bergen lies in the mo&s;t &s;outherly and we&s;terly part of Norway, including the city of the &s;ame name, which is an epi&s;copal &s;ee, and a place of con&s;iderable trade; and Staff|hanger, &s;ituated in the bay of Buckenfior, about eighty miles to the &s;outhward of Bergen. The third province, called Drontheim or Trontheim, extends about five hundred miles along the coa&s;t; and is but thinly peopled. The chief town Dron|theim, &s;eated on a little gulph at the mouth of the river Nider, is the only metropolitan &s;ee in Nor|way; and carries on a con&s;iderable trade in ma&s;ts, deals, tar, copper, and iron. Leet&s;ttrand, Stron|den, Scoerdale, Opdal, Rom&s;dael, and Solendael, are likewi&s;e places of &s;ome traffic. The northern divi&s;ion of Drontheim, called the &s;ub-government of Salten, comprehends the towns of Melanger and Scheen. The province of Wardhus, extend|ing to the North Cape, and including the i&s;lands, is divided into two parts; namely, Finmark and Norwegian Lapland. The chief town, which is very incon&s;iderable, &s;tands upon an i&s;land, called Ward, from whence the place and the government derive their name. The province of Bahus, though now yielded to the Swedes, is reckoned part of Norway, being a narrow tract of land, about ninety miles in length, lying on the coa&s;t of the Categate.</P>

<HEAD>MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>The great chain of Norway mountains, running from north to &s;outh, called indifferently Rudfield, Sudefield, Skarsfield, and Scoreberg, is known in different parts by other appellations; &s;uch as Do|frefield,
<PB N="56" REF="650">
Lamsfield, Sagnefield, Filefield, Halne|field, Hardangerfield, Jocklefield, Byglefield, Hicklefield, and Hangfield. The heighth and breadth of this exten&s;ive chain likewi&s;e vary in different parts. To pa&s;s the mountain Hardanger, a man mu&s;t travel about &s;eventy Engli&s;h miles; whereas Filefield may be about fifty over. This la&s;t ri&s;es about two miles and a half in perpendi|cular height: but Dofrefield is counted the highe&s;t mountain of Norway, if not of Europe. The river Drivane winds along the &s;ide of it in a &s;erpentine cour&s;e, &s;o as to be met nine times by tho&s;e who travel the winter-road to the other &s;ide of the chain. The bridges are thrown over roaring cataracts, and but indifferently fa&s;tened to the &s;teep rocks on either &s;ide; &s;o that the whole exhibits a very dreadful appearance, &s;ufficient to deter the traveller from hazarding &s;uch a dangerous pa&s;&s;age: for which rea&s;on, people generally choo&s;e the road over File|field, which is much more tedious. This, how|ever, is the po&s;t-road u&s;ed by the king's carriages. The way is di&s;tingui&s;hed by po&s;ts fixed at the di&s;|tance of two hundred paces from each other, that, in &s;nowy or dark weather, the traveller may not be bewildered. For the convenience of re&s;ting and refre&s;hing, there are two mountain-&s;toves or hou&s;es maintained on Filefield, as well as upon other mountains, at the expence of the publick, and furni&s;hed with fire, light, and kitchen uten&s;ils. Nothing can be more di&s;mal and dreary than the&s;e mountains, covered with eternal &s;now, where neither hou&s;e, tree, nor living creature is to be &s;een, but here and there a &s;olitary rein-deer, and perchance a few wandering Laplanders.</P>
<P>In travelling from Sweden to Nordenfields, there is only one way of avoiding this chain of moun|tains; and that is, where it is interrupted by a long
<PB N="57" REF="660">
deep valley, extending from Rom&s;dale to Guld|brand&s;dale. In the year 1612, a body of one thou|&s;and Scots, commanded by Sinclair, and &s;ent over as auxiliaries to the Swedes, were put to the &s;word in this defile, by the pea&s;ants of Guldbrand, who never give quarter.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides this chain, there is a great number of detached mountains over all the country, that form valleys and ridges, inhabited by the pea&s;ants. Some of the&s;e are of incredible height, and others exhibit very remarkable appearances. In &s;ailing up Joering Creek, on the left hand, the &s;ight is a&s;toni&s;hed with a groupe of mountains, re&s;embling the pro&s;pect of a city, with old Gothick towers and edifices. In the pari&s;h of Oer&s;kong is the high mountain Skop&s;horn, the top of which repre&s;ents the figure of a fortification, with regular walls and ba&s;tions. In the di&s;trict of Hilgeland appears a very high range of mountains, with &s;even pin|nacles or cre&s;ts, known by the appellation of the Seven Si&s;ters, di&s;cernible a great way off at &s;ea. To the &s;outhward of this range, though in the &s;ame di&s;trict, ri&s;es the famous mountain Torghat|ten, &s;o called becau&s;e the &s;ummit re&s;embles a man's head with a hat on, under which appears a &s;ingle eye, formed by an aperture through the mountain, one hundred and fifty ells high, and three thou&s;and ells in length. The &s;un may be &s;een through this &s;urpri&s;ing cavity, which is pa&s;&s;able by the foot of travellers. On the top of the mountain we find a re&s;ervoir of water, as large as a moderate fi&s;h-pond: in the lower part is a cavern, through which a line, four hundred fathoms in length, being let down, did not reach the bottom. At Herroe in Sund|moer is another cavern, called Dol&s;teen, &s;uppo&s;ed to reach under the &s;ea to Scotland <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This, however, is no more than an idle tradition.</NOTE>. In the year
<PB N="58" REF="670">
1750, two clergymen entered this &s;ubterranean cavity, and proceeded a con&s;iderable way, until they heard the &s;ea da&s;hing over their heads: the pa&s;&s;age was as wide and high as an ordinary church, the &s;ides perpendicular, and the roof vaulted. They de&s;cended one flight of natural &s;tairs; but, arriving at another, they were afraid to penetrate farther: they had gone &s;o far, how|ever, that two candles were con&s;umed in their pro|gre&s;s and return. A cavern of a very curious na|ture, &s;erving as a conduit to a &s;tream of water, penetrates through the &s;ides of the mountain Li|mur. In the di&s;trict of Rake, in the neighbour|hood of Frederick&s;hall, are three cavities in a rock; one of which is &s;o deep, that a &s;mall &s;tone dropped down, does not reach the bottom in le&s;s than two minutes; and then the &s;ound it produces is plea&s;ant and melodious, not unlike the &s;ound of a bell.</P>
<P>The va&s;t mountains and rugged rocks that de|form the face of this country, are productive of numberle&s;s inconveniences. They admit of little arable ground: they render the country in &s;ome parts impa&s;&s;able, and every where difficult to tra|vellers: they afford &s;helter to wild bea&s;ts, which come from their lurking holes, and make terrible havock among the flocks of cattle: they expo&s;e the &s;heep and goats, as well as the pea&s;ant, to daily accidents of falling over precipices: they occa&s;ion &s;udden torrents, and falls of &s;now, that de&s;cend with incredible impetuo&s;ity, and often &s;weep away the labours of the hu&s;bandman; and they are &s;ub|ject to dreadful di&s;ruptions, by which huge rocks are rent from their &s;ides, and, hurling down, over|whelm the plains below with inevitable ruin. The pea&s;ants frequently build their hou&s;es on the edge of a &s;teep precipice, to which they mu&s;t climb by ladders, at the hazard of their lives; and when a per&s;on dies, the corp&s;e mu&s;t be let down with ropes,
<PB N="59" REF="680">
before it can be laid in the coffin. In winter the mail is often drawn up the &s;ides of &s;teep moun|tains. Even in the king's road, travellers are ex|po&s;ed to the frequent ri&s;ques of falling over tho&s;e dreadful rocks; for they are obliged to pa&s;s over narrow pathways, without rails or ri&s;ing on the &s;ides, either &s;hored up with rotten po&s;ts, or &s;u&s;|pended by iron bolts, fa&s;tened in the mountains. In the narrow pa&s;s of Naeroe is a remarkable way of this kind, which, above &s;ix hundred years ago, the famous king Suerre cau&s;ed to be made for the pa&s;&s;age of his cavalry; and even this would have been found impa&s;&s;able by any other hor&s;es than tho&s;e of Norway, which are u&s;ed to climb the rocks like goats. Another very difficult and dangerous road is that between Shog&s;tadt and Vang in Vol|ders, along the &s;ide of a &s;teep mountain, in &s;ome places &s;o narrow, that if two travellers on hor&s;e|back &s;hould meet in the night, they would find it impracticable either to pa&s;s each other, or turn back. In &s;uch a ca&s;e their lives could not be &s;aved, unle&s;s one of them &s;hould alight, and throw his hor&s;e headlong into the lake below, and then cling to the rock, until the other could pa&s;s. When a &s;heep or goat makes a fal&s;e &s;tep to the projection of a rock, from whence it can neither a&s;cend nor de&s;cend, the owner hazards his own life to pre&s;erve that of the animal. He directs him&s;elf to be lowered down from the top of the mountain, &s;itting on a cro&s;s &s;tick, tied to the end of a long rope; and when he arrives at the place where the creature &s;tands, he fa&s;tens it to the &s;ame cord, and it is drawn up with him&s;elf. Perhaps the other end of the rope is held by one per&s;on only; and there are &s;ome in&s;tances in which the a&s;&s;i&s;tant has been dragged down by the weight of his friend, &s;o that both have peri&s;hed. When either man or bea&s;t has had the misfortune to fall over very high pre|cipices,
<PB N="60" REF="690">
they have not only been &s;uffocated by the repercu&s;&s;ion of the air, but their bodies have been always bur&s;t before they reached the ground. Sometimes intire cre&s;ts of rocks, many fathoms in length and breadth, have fallen down at once, creating &s;uch a violent agitation of the air as &s;eemed a prelude to the world's di&s;&s;olution. At Steenbroc in Laerdale, a &s;tupendous ma&s;s, larger than any ca&s;tle in the univer&s;e, appears to have been &s;evered and tumbled from the mountain in large, &s;harp, and ragged fragments, through which the river roars with hideous bellowing. In the year 1731, a promontory on Sundmoer, called Rammersfield, that hung over Nordal Creek, &s;uddenly gave way, and plunged into the water; which &s;welled to &s;uch a degree, that the church of Strand, though half a league on the other &s;ide of the bank, was over|flowed: the creek, however, was not filled up; on the contrary, the fi&s;hermen declare they find no difference in the depth, which is &s;aid to exceed nine hundred fathoms.</P>

<HEAD>RIVERS.</HEAD>
<P>The remarkable rivers of Norway are the&s;e: the Nied, i&s;&s;uing from Tydalen, on the borders of Sweden, runs we&s;tward into the lake Selboe; and afterwards, turning to the northward, pa&s;&s;es by the city of Drontheim, to which it antiently gave the name of Nideros and Nidro&s;ia: Sule Ely, that, de&s;cending from Sulefield, runs with a rapid cour&s;e through Nordale into the &s;ea: Gulen, which ri&s;es near Skarsfield in the north; and running twenty leagues we&s;tward, through Aalen, Hlotaalen, Sto|ren, and Melhuus, di&s;charges it&s;elf into the &s;ea, about a league to the we&s;t of Drontheim. In the year 1344, this river buried it&s;elf under ground; from whence it again bur&s;t forth with &s;uch vio|lence, that the earth and &s;tones thrown up by the
<PB N="61" REF="700">
eruption, filled the valley, and formed a dam, which, however, was &s;oon broken and wa&s;hed away by the force of the water. Divers churches, eight and forty farm-hou&s;es, with two hundred and fifty per&s;ons, were de&s;troyed on this occa&s;ion. Otte|roen, a large river, taking its ri&s;e from the moun|tain Agde, runs about thirty leagues through Seet|terdale and Efie, and di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the cataract of Wiland. The river Syre ri&s;es near the mountain Lang, and winds its cour&s;e through the vale of Syre into the lake of Lunde, in the dioce&s;e of Chri&s;tian&s;and: thence it continues its way to the &s;ea, into which it di&s;charges it&s;elf through a nar|row &s;trait formed by two rocks. This contraction augments its impetuo&s;ity, &s;o that it &s;hoots like an arrow into the &s;ea, in which it produces a very great agitation. Nid and Sheen are two con&s;iderable rivers, i&s;&s;uing out of Tillemark. Their water|falls have been diverted, with infinite labour, by canals and pa&s;&s;ages cut through the rocks, for the convenience of floating down the timber. Tyre|fiord, or Dramme, is in the neighbourhood of Ho|nifo&s;&s;e, joined by two rivers from Oedale and Ha|deland, and di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the &s;ea, near Bragne&s;s. Loven ri&s;es in the highe&s;t part of Num|medal, and runs through Kong&s;berg to the &s;ea near Laurwig. Glaamen is the large&s;t river of Norway, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Stor-Elven, or the great river. It derives its origin from the moun|tain Dofre, from whence it winds all along the plains of Oe&s;terdale and Soloe; then joins the Vorme, another con&s;iderable river ri&s;ing out of Mioes and Guld&s;brand&s;dale. The&s;e being joined, traver&s;e the lake Oeyeren; and thence i&s;&s;uing, run on to Sarp near Frederick&s;tadt.</P>

Snaa&s;en, Selboe, the greater and le&s;&s;er Mioes, Slirevand, Sperdille, Rand, Ve&s;ten, Saren, Mo|dum, Lund, Nor&s;oe, Huid&s;oe, Fari&s;vand, and Oe|yevand: all the&s;e are well &s;tocked with fi&s;h, and navigable for large ve&s;&s;els. Wars have been for|merly maintained on the&s;e inland &s;eas; in &s;ome of which are &s;mall floating i&s;lands, or parcels of earth, with trees on them, &s;eparated from the main land, and probably pre&s;erved in compact ma&s;&s;es by the roots of trees, &s;hrubs, and gra&s;s, interwoven in the &s;oil. In the year 1702, the family-&s;eat of Borge, near Frederick&s;tadt, being a noble edifice, with lofty towers and battlements, &s;uddenly &s;unk into an aby&s;s one hundred fathoms in depth, which was in&s;tantaneou&s;ly filled with a piece of water, form|ing a lake three hundred ells in length, and about half as broad. Fourteen per&s;ons, with two hun|dred head of cattle, peri&s;hed in this cata&s;trophe, which was occa&s;ioned by the river Glaamen preci|pitating it&s;elf down a water-fall near Sarp, and undermining the foundation. Of all the water|falls in Norway, this of Sarp is the mo&s;t dangerous for its height and rapidity. The current drives &s;eventeen mills; and roars along with &s;uch vio|lence, that the water, being da&s;hed and commi|nuted among the rocks, ri&s;es in the form of rain, where a beautiful rainbow may be always &s;een when the &s;un &s;hines. In antient times this cataract was u&s;ed for the execution of traitors, and other male|factors: they were thrown down alive, that they might be da&s;hed in pieces on the points of rocks, and die in a dreadful commotion, analogous to tho&s;e they had endeavoured to excite in the com|munity.</P>

commerce in this country. They chiefly con&s;i&s;t of fir and pine, for which great &s;ums are received from foreigners, who export an immen&s;e number of ma&s;ts, beams, planks, and boards. Be&s;ides, an incredible quantity is con&s;umed at home, in building hou&s;es, &s;hips, bridges, piles, moles, and fences, over and above the va&s;t demand for char|coal to the founderies, and fuel for dome&s;tic u&s;es. Nay, in &s;ome places, the trees are felled for no other purpo&s;e but to clear the ground, and be burned into a&s;hes for manure. A good quantity of timber is yearly exported from the we&s;tern coa&s;t to Scotland and Spain: but this is incon&s;iderable, when compared to the immen&s;e exports from Dram|men, Frederick&s;hall, Frederick&s;tadt, Chri&s;tiania, Skeen, Arendal, Chri&s;tian&s;and, Chri&s;tian's Bay, and Drontheim. The ma&s;ts and large beams are floated down the rivers, and the re&s;t is divided into boards at the &s;aw-mills. The&s;e works &s;upply an infinite number of families with a comfortable &s;ub&s;i&s;tence: a tenth of all &s;awed timber belongs to his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty, and makes a con&s;iderable branch of his revenue. The fore&s;ts in Norway are &s;o va&s;t and thick, that the people &s;eem to think there can never be a &s;carcity of wood, e&s;pecially as the &s;oil is peculiarly adapted for the production of timber: they therefore de&s;troy it with a wa&s;teful hand; in|&s;omuch that more wood rots in Norway, than is burned in the whole kingdom of Denmark. The be&s;t timber grows in the provinces of Saltan, Helle|land, Rom&s;dale, Guldbrand&s;dale, Oe&s;terdale, Soloe, Valders, Hallingdal, Sognifiord, Tellemark, and the lord&s;hip of Nedene.</P>

<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The climate and atmo&s;phere of Norway are va|rious in different parts of the kingdom. At Ber|gen the winter is &s;o moderate, that the &s;eas are
<PB N="64" REF="730">
always open and practicable both to mariners and fi&s;hermen, except in creeks and bays, that reach far up into the country towards Filefield, when the keen north-ea&s;t wind blows from the land. On the ea&s;t-&s;ide of Norway, from the frontiers of Swe|den to Filefield, the cold generally &s;ets in about the middle of October with great &s;everity, and la&s;ts till the middle of April; during which interval the waters are frozen to a con&s;iderable thickne&s;s, and the face of the country is covered with &s;now. In the year 1719, &s;even thou&s;and Swedes, who intended to attack Drontheim, peri&s;hed in the &s;now on the mountain of Ruden or Tydal, which &s;eparates Jempteland in Sweden from the dioce&s;e of Dron|theim. A company of two hundred Norwegian &s;ledgemen, under major Emahus, found them all frozen to death on the ridge of the mountain, where they had been &s;urpri&s;ed by a &s;torm accom|panied with &s;now, hail, and extreme cold. Some of tho&s;e unhappy victims appeared &s;itting, &s;ome lying, and others kneeling in a po&s;ture of praying. They had cut in pieces their mu&s;kets, and burned the little wood they afforded. The generals La|barre and Zoega lo&s;t their lives; and of the whole body, con&s;i&s;ting originally of ten thou&s;and, not above two thou&s;and five hundred &s;urvived this dreadful ca|ta&s;trophe. This hard weather enabbles the pea&s;ants to convey the timber they have felled to the next rivers, along which they likewi&s;e carry their corn, butter, and other commodities to market upon &s;ledges.</P>
<P>The cold is &s;till more inten&s;e in that part of Norway called Finmark, &s;ituated in the Frigid Zone, near the Polar Circle. But, if the winter is generally cold, the &s;ummer is often exce&s;&s;ively hot in Norway. The rays of the &s;un are rever|berated from the &s;ides of the mountains, &s;o as to render the weather clo&s;e and &s;ultry in the vallies: be&s;ides, the &s;un's ab&s;ence below the horizon, is &s;o
<PB N="65" REF="740">
&s;hort, that the atmo&s;phere and mountains have not time to cool. The heat is &s;o great, that all vegetation is remarkably quick. Barley is &s;own, grows, ripens, and is reaped in the &s;pace of &s;ix weeks, or two months.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to light, the longe&s;t day at Ber|gen con&s;i&s;ts of nineteen hours; the &s;un ri&s;ing at half an hour after two, and &s;etting at half an hour after nine. The &s;horte&s;t day does not ex|ceed &s;ix hours; for the &s;un ri&s;es at nine in the morning, and &s;ets about three in the afternoon. In the beginning of the year, the day-light increa&s;es with remarkable celerity, and at the approach of winter decrea&s;es in the &s;ame proportion; phaeno|mena owing to the earth's inclination towards the Poles. In &s;ummer, one may read and write at midnight by the light of the &s;ky. Chri&s;tian V. while he re&s;ided at Drontheim, u&s;ed to &s;up at mid|night without candles. In the di&s;trict of Trom&s;en, at the extremity of Norway, the &s;un is continually in view at mid&s;ummer. It is &s;een to circulate day and night round the North Pole, contracting its orbit, and then gradually enlarging it, until at length it leaves the horizon. In the depth of win|ter, therefore, it is for &s;ome weeks invi&s;ible; and all the light perceived at noon is a faint glimmer|ing for about an hour and an half, proceeding from the reflection of the &s;un's rays on the highe&s;t moun|tains. But the inhabitants of the&s;e northern pro|vinces are &s;upplied with other lights, that enable them to exerci&s;e their fi&s;hery and other employ|ments in the open air. The &s;ky being generally &s;erene, the moon&s;hire is remarkably bright, and, being reflected from the mountains, illuminates the vallies: the people are moreover a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the north light, called Aurora Borealis, which is very frequent in the northern parts of Europe.</P>
<P>The air of Norway, with re&s;pect to health, is gene|rally pure and &s;alubrious. On the &s;ea coa&s;ts, indeed,
<PB N="66" REF="750">
it is rendered moi&s;t by vapours and exhalations: but, in the midland parts of the country, towards the mountains, the climate is &s;o dry and purified, that meal may be kept for many years, without being worm-eaten or damaged in the lea&s;t. The inha|bitants have no idea of &s;ickne&s;s, except that which is contracted from exce&s;&s;es. It is &s;aid, that in the vale of Guldbrand the pea&s;ants live to &s;uch extreme old age, that they become weary of life, and cau&s;e them&s;elves to be removed to a le&s;s &s;alubrious cli|mate, whereby they may have a chance for dying the &s;ooner. In con&s;umptions, however, the moi&s;t air on the &s;ea-&s;ide is found more agreeable to the lungs in re&s;piration. Norway, being a mountain|ous country, inter&s;ected by creeks, abounding with lakes, rivers, and &s;now, mu&s;t be &s;ubject to fre|quent rains. From &s;udden thaws, the inhabitants are &s;ometimes expo&s;ed to terrible di&s;a&s;ters. Va&s;t ma&s;&s;es of &s;now, falling from precipices, overwhelm men, cattle, boats, hou&s;es, nay, even whole vil|lages. About two centuries ago a whole pari&s;h, &s;ituated between Quindhorret and Hardanger, was by a &s;now-fall covered and de&s;troyed. Several dome&s;tic uten&s;ils, as &s;ci&s;&s;ars, knives, and ba&s;ons, have been at different times brought to light by a rivulet that runs under the &s;now, which has been gradually hardened and increa&s;ed by repeated fro&s;ts and annual acce&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>The winds that chiefly prevail on the we&s;tern coa&s;t, are tho&s;e that blow from the &s;outh; where|as, on the other &s;ide of Filefield, the winds that produce and continue the hard fro&s;ts, are al|ways northerly. In the &s;ummer there is a kind of regular trade-wind on the coa&s;t of Bergen. In the forenoon the &s;ea begins to be cooled with a we&s;terly breeze, which continues till mid|night: then the land-breeze begins from the ea&s;t, and blows till about ten in the morning. The
<PB N="67" REF="760">
coa&s;t is likewi&s;e &s;ubject to &s;udden &s;qualls and &s;torms. Hurricanes &s;ometimes ri&s;e at &s;ea; and in the&s;e lati|tudes the phaenomenon called a Water-&s;pout, is not uncommon. One of the&s;e vortices, in the neighbourhood of Ferro, is &s;aid to have &s;ucked up with the water &s;ome la&s;ts of herrings, which were afterwards dropped on Kolter, a mountain twelve hundred feet high.</P>

<HEAD>SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;oil of Norway varies in different places, according to the &s;ituation of rock or valley. The mountains here, as in every other country, are bare and barren: but the &s;poils of them, wa&s;hed down by torrents, &s;now and rain, enrich and fertilize the valleys. In the&s;e the &s;oil generally con&s;i&s;ts of black mould, &s;and, loom, chalk, and gravel, lying over each other in unequal &s;trata, and &s;ometimes in three or four &s;ucce&s;&s;ions: the mould that lies up|permo&s;t is very fine and mellow, and fit to nouri&s;h all &s;orts of vegetables. There is al&s;o clay found in different parts of this kingdom, of which the in|habitants begin to make earthen ware; but bricks and tiles are not u&s;ed in building. The face of the country is, in many places, deformed by large &s;wamps and mar&s;hes, very dangerous to the tra|veller. Near Lee&s;&s;oe, in the dioce&s;e of Chri&s;tian|&s;and,

a wooden cau&s;eway is extended near a mile over a mora&s;s; and if a hor&s;e, or any other animal, &s;hould make a fal&s;e &s;tep, he will &s;ink at once into the aby&s;s, never to ri&s;e again.</P>

<HEAD>PRODUCTIONS: VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<P>In a cold country, like Norway, roughened with rocks and mountains, inter&s;per&s;ed with bogs, and covered with fore&s;ts, we cannot expect to find agri|culture in perfection. The plowed lands, in re&s;pect to mountains, woods, meadows, and wa&s;tes, do not exceed the proportion of one to eighty; &s;o that the whole country does not produce corn to maintain above half the number of its inhabitants. The pea&s;ants are di&s;couraged from the practice of hu&s;|bandry, by the frequency of accidents that &s;eem peculiar to the climate. Even in the mo&s;t fruitful provinces of Guldbrand&s;dale, Oe&s;terdale, and Soloer, as well as in other places, when the corn appears in the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing condition, the whole hope of the harve&s;t is &s;ometimes de&s;troyed in one night by a &s;udden fro&s;t, that nips the blade and extin|gui&s;hes the vegetation. The kingdom is more|over vi&s;ited by &s;ome unfavourable years, in which the &s;un &s;eems to have lo&s;t his genial power; the vegetables are &s;tunted; the trees bud and bloom, yet bear no fruit; and the grain, though it ri&s;es, will produce nought but empty ears and &s;traw. This calamity, however, rarely occurs; and, in general, the cultivated parts of Norway yield plen|tiful crops of excellent rye, barley, and oats. The mo&s;t fruitful provinces are Nordland, Inderberre, and Numedale, in the dioce&s;e of Drontheim; Sog+nifiord and Vaas, in that of Bergen; Jedderen, Ryefylk, Raabygdelag, and the lord&s;hip of Ne|denes, in the dioce&s;e of Chri&s;tian&s;and; Hedemark, in the dioce&s;e of Aggerhuus; Hadeland, Toten, Romerige, Ringerige, and Guldbrand&s;dale: the&s;e
<PB N="69" REF="780">
territories not only produce grain enough for their own con&s;umption, but likewi&s;e &s;upport their neigh|bours, and even &s;upply part of Sweden. Peas are likewi&s;e propagated in this country, together with wheat, buck-wheat, hops, hemp, and flax; but not to any con&s;iderable advantage. The meadows are liberally &s;tored with rich pa&s;turage for &s;heep and cattle, and the fields are productive of tho&s;e vegetables which are common in other northern countries. Among the other kinds of gra&s;s here found, is what botani&s;ts call <HI>viola canina,</HI> with &s;hort broad leaves; a plant which contributed, in a very &s;urpri&s;ing manner, to the pre&s;ervation of two Nor|way youths in the year 1652. The&s;e brothers, on the fir&s;t day of Augu&s;t, made an excur&s;ion from their father's hou&s;e, of about twenty Engli&s;h miles, to enjoy the diver&s;ions of &s;hooting and fi&s;hing, in the mountains that &s;eparate Guldbrand&s;dale from the province of Valders. After having &s;tayed four days fi&s;hing in the lake of Rif, they rowed in a &s;kiff to a very &s;mall i&s;land of this lake, about &s;ix|teen paces in length. Here while they remained, the &s;kiff broke loo&s;e, in con&s;equence of a &s;udden &s;quall, and was driven to the other &s;hore, where their dog &s;tood waiting for his ma&s;ters. As neither of the youths could &s;wim, they &s;aw them&s;elves thus abandoned to famine, on a de&s;olate i&s;land, &s;eque&s;tered from all intercour&s;e with mankind. Their fir&s;t care was to build a kind of hut of &s;mall &s;tones, that they might, in &s;ome degree, be &s;creened from the inclemency of the weather. Towards the clo&s;e of the &s;econd day, their appetite being whetted to the keene&s;t &s;en&s;e of hunger, they indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;ought &s;ome vegetable food, and ventured to eat the <HI>viola canina,</HI> each to the amount of an ounce, twice a day; and this was all they could find at one &s;earch. Their &s;tomachs were ea&s;ed, their &s;pirits refre&s;hed, and the acute pains which had begun to
<PB N="70" REF="790">
&s;eize their arms and &s;houlders, immediately abated. Eleven days did they &s;ub&s;i&s;t on this vegetable; but it failed on the twelfth, and they were reduced to the brink of de&s;pair, when they accidentally found a little &s;pot overgrown with &s;orrel, which they con|&s;umed at one meal: neverthele&s;s, it was reproduced in le&s;s than four and twenty hours; and the devout young men, with tears of gratitude, and due ac|knowledgments to heaven, owned it as an interpo|&s;ition of Providence in their behalf. During the fir&s;t days of their &s;uffering, they had called and beckoned to their dog, and u&s;ed every po&s;&s;ible al|lurement to induce that animal to &s;wim over, that they might kill him for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; but he would not obey their &s;ignals. They were now re|duced to &s;uch a weak condition, that they could not &s;tand, and hardly made &s;hift to creep from their hut in que&s;t of the &s;orrel. The elde&s;t was &s;eized with a violent palpitation of the heart, which throbbed &s;o loud as to be heard at &s;ome di&s;tance, and he appeared to be in extremity. The younger, with his knife, engraved upon a piece of timber a &s;hort account of their unhappy fate, and pointed out a text in the P&s;alms, on which he reque&s;ted that their funeral &s;ermon might be preached. Then they joined in fervent prayer, and, embracing one another, re&s;igned them&s;elves to death without mur|muring. Their dog had tarried eight days with their baggage on the &s;hore, and then returned to their father's hou&s;e, where he refu&s;ed food; but howled and moaned ince&s;&s;antly. From the grief of this faithful animal, the parents concluded that their children had met with &s;ome misfortune, and di&s;patched a man in &s;earch of them to the moun|tain. He arrived on the eleventh day at the lake, where he found their cloaths, and, concluding they were drowned, returned with the&s;e melancholy tidings. On the thirteenth day of their famine,
<PB N="71" REF="800">
the youths, having by this time given up all hope of relief, heard the &s;ound of hor&s;es travelling up the mountains. They forthwith rai&s;ed their voices, and, being heard, the travellers ha&s;tened to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The &s;kiff being happily found on the &s;hore undamaged, the humane &s;trangers put off to the little i&s;land, where they found the brothers al|mo&s;t exhau&s;ted. When food was offered to the elder brother, his &s;tomach could hardly bear the &s;malle&s;t portion; and after he was conveyed to his father's hou&s;e, he continued &s;ome days in a very dangerous di&s;order; of which however he reco|vered, and &s;urvived this di&s;a&s;ter &s;even and thirty years. The other &s;oon retrieved his &s;trength and health; and in the year 1691 drew up this narra|tion, as a pious acknowledgment of God's pro|vidence.</P>
<P>Within the&s;e forty years the people of Norway have be&s;towed &s;ome attention to the culture of gardens, which in former times was &s;o neglected, that the cities and towns were &s;upplied with leeks, cabbage, and roots from England and Holland. At pre&s;ent, however, the Norwegians rai&s;e their own culinary and garden roots and vegetables, which thrive there as well as in any other country. Among the plants that grow wild in this kingdom, there are &s;ome &s;aid to be peculiar to the &s;oil; &s;uch as a &s;pecies of the <HI>nummularia &s;ylve&s;tris,</HI> of which the inhabitants drink an infu&s;ion like tea, as a noble pectoral; the <HI>piper aquaticum</HI> of Lange, and many others, which are not to be found in any Herbal. The &s;curvy being a di&s;ea&s;e that prevails on the &s;ea|coa&s;t, Nature has &s;cattered all along it a variety of herbs, efficacious in the cure of that di&s;temper; &s;uch as angelica, ro&s;e-wort, gentian, cre&s;&s;es, tre|foils, &s;orrels, &s;curvy-gra&s;s, and a plant called erich's gra&s;s, that grows in great plenty on the i&s;lands of Northland; from whence the people of the con|tinent
<PB N="72" REF="810">
fetch away boat-loads of it, to be pre&s;erved in barrels, as a &s;uccedaneum for cabbage. There are al&s;o a few noxious vegetables, little known in any other country but Norway. In Guldbrand&s;dale is a &s;pecies of gra&s;s, called &s;el&s;nape; the root of which is &s;o poi&s;onous, that any bea&s;t which eats of it dies immediately, the belly bur&s;ting: nay, the carnivorous fowls that prey upon the carca&s;e of the bea&s;t, meet with the &s;ame fate. Children have been more than once poi&s;oned by taking this root, which neverthele&s;s is &s;ometimes u&s;ed externally, as an amulet for arthritic di&s;orders. Another ve|getable, pernicious to the cattle, is the <HI>gramen o&s;&s;i|fragum Norwegien&s;e,</HI> which is &s;aid to mollify the benes of tho&s;e animals by whom it is eaten. Among the noxious plants of Norway we may al&s;o rank the igle-gra&s;s, fatal to &s;heep and goats; the tour-gra&s;s, which affects hor&s;es and cows with a toroor or lethargy; and the plant torboe, or hi&s;te|&s;pring, which produces nearly the &s;ame effect on hor&s;es, but is not at all prejudicial to cows, &s;heep, or any ruminating animals. The herb turte, not unlike angelica, operates nearly in the &s;ame man|ner: yet the bears are &s;aid to feed upon it with peculiar reli&s;h; and when their hair begins to fall off, in con&s;equence of eating this plant, they have recour&s;e for relief to the fle&s;h of animals.</P>
<P>The common fruit-trees thrive tolerably well in Norway, the inhabitants of which have plenty of cherries, apples, and pears. Some kinds of plumbs attain to maturity, which is very &s;eldom the ca&s;e with grapes, apricots, and peaches: but even the apples and pears that ripen here are &s;ummer-fruit: that which grows till the winter, &s;eldom comes to per|fection. Great variety of agreeable berries are pro|duced in different parts of this kingdom; &s;uch as the hagebar, a kind of &s;loes, an infu&s;ion of which in wine makes a plea&s;ant cooling liquor; juniper-berries, co|rinths,
<PB N="73" REF="820">
red and white; &s;oelbar, or &s;un-berries; ra&s;p|berries, goo&s;eberries, blackberries, barberries, bil|burnes, cranberries, &s;trawberries, and many other &s;pe|cies, that &s;eem to be natives of Norway and Sweden. Among the&s;e are the tranaeber, the produce of the myrtillus repens, red and au&s;tere, found in the &s;pring in perfection under the &s;now, and much re|li&s;hed by the rein-deer; crakebeer, re&s;embling bil|berries, deemed a powerful anti-&s;corbutic; ager|beer, larger and blacker than bilberries, of a plea|&s;ant acid, ripened by cold, and u&s;ed as cherries for an infu&s;ion in wine: and, finally, tyltebeer, a red plea&s;ant berry, growing on a &s;hort &s;tem, with leaves like tho&s;e of box: they are plucked off by hand|fulls, and &s;ent to Denmark to be pre&s;erved for the table, where they are eaten by way of de&s;ert.</P>
<P>Of the trees that grow wild in Norway, the principal are the fir and the pine. The fir&s;t yields an annual revenue, amounting to a million of rix|dollars, if we include the advantages re&s;ulting from the &s;aw-mills and the ma&s;ts; one of which la&s;t has been known to &s;ell for two hundred rix|dollars. The red fir-tree, which grows on the mountains, is &s;o rich in turpentine as to be almo&s;t incorruptible. Some of the hou&s;es belonging to the Norway pea&s;ants, built of this timber, are &s;up|po&s;ed to be above four hundred years &s;tanding. In Guldbrand&s;dale the hou&s;e is &s;till to be &s;een &s;tand|ing in which king Olaf lodged five nights, above &s;even hundred years ago, when he travelled round the kingdom to convert the people to the chri&s;tian faith. Even an hundred years after the trunk of the fir-tree has been cut down, the pea&s;ants burn the roots for tar, which is a very profitable com|modity. In the fens, the re&s;in of the fir-tree is by nature transformed into a &s;ub&s;tance, which may be termed Norway frankincen&s;e. The buds or pine|apples of this tree, boiled in &s;tale beer, make an
<PB N="74" REF="830">
excellent medicine for the &s;curvy; not &s;o unplea|&s;ant to the ta&s;te, though counted as efficacious as tar-water. The pine-tree is more tall and beauti|ful than the fir; but far inferior to it in &s;trength and quality: therefore the boards or planks of it are &s;old at a lower rate, and the pea&s;ant wa&s;tes it without remor&s;e. Norway likewi&s;e produces &s;ome fore&s;ts of oak, which is found to be excellent for &s;hip-building. Here al&s;o we find the elm, who&s;e bark, being powdered, is boiled up with other food to fatten hogs, and even mixed by the poor among their meal; the a&s;h, from which the pea&s;ants di&s;til a bal&s;am u&s;ed in certain di&s;orders, both externally and internally; barlind, a kind of yew; beenved, a &s;pecies of the privet, very hard and &s;olid; birch, that in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner re&s;i&s;ts putrefaction, and yields a whol&s;ome juice, not inferior to palm-wine; beech, alder, juniper; from the fruit of which la&s;t a valuable oil is extracted; the a&s;per, the cornel, the bullace or &s;loe, the hazle, which grows here in &s;uch abundance, that an hundred ton of nuts are yearly exported from Bergen alone; the elder, the lime, the maple, the &s;pina chri&s;ti, the wild prune|tree, and the axel, another of the &s;ame &s;pecies, peculiar to Norway and Sweden. The bottom of the Norwegian &s;ea affords al&s;o a variety of &s;ub|marine weeds, trees, corals, and corallines.</P>

<P>A diver&s;ity of &s;tones is found in Norway, and &s;ome of a &s;urpri&s;ing texture. Several mountains chiefly con&s;i&s;t of a brown pebble, which decays with age; nay, it di&s;&s;olves, and &s;ometimes drops into the &s;ea: the cement being thus loo&s;ened, a terrible di&s;ruption often en&s;ues. In &s;ome places, the grey and black pebbles are intermixed with iron, copper, lead, &s;ilver, and gold. The ground, in certain di&s;tricts, is covered with the fragments
<PB N="75" REF="840">
of rocks, that have been precipitated from the &s;ummits of mountains, and broken in their fall into innumerable &s;hivers. About twenty years ago, in the neighbourhood of Bergen, a man was &s;uddenly overwhelmed with &s;uch a ma&s;s, which formed a kind of vault around him. In this dread|ful tomb he remained alive for &s;everal weeks: by his loud cries, the place of his confinement was di&s;covered; but it was found impracticable to re|move the huge &s;tones by which he was inclo&s;ed. All that his friends could do for his relief, was to lower down meat and drink to him, through &s;ome crevices; but, at length, the &s;tones fell in and cru&s;hed him to death.</P>
<P>Here are inexhau&s;tible quarries of excellent marble, black, white, blue, grey, and variegated; together with &s;ome detached pieces of alaba&s;ter, &s;everal kinds of &s;par, chalk-&s;tone, cement-&s;tone, &s;and-&s;tone, mill-&s;tone, baking-&s;tone, &s;late, talc, the magnet or load-&s;tone, found in the iron-mines; &s;wine-&s;tone, a production natural to Norway and Sweden, of a brown colour, fetid &s;mell, in texture re&s;embling cry&s;tal, and deriving its name from its efficacy in a di&s;temper incident to &s;wine; amian|thus, or a&s;be&s;tos, the &s;tone-flax or &s;tone-&s;ilk, con|&s;i&s;ting of fine fibres or threads, which are &s;pun and woven into a kind of cloth: this, when &s;oiled, is made clean by being thrown into the fire.

<HEAD>METALS AND MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ubterranean mineral trea&s;ures of Norway are immen&s;e. Gold has been heretofore found, in a &s;mall quantity, in the dioce&s;e of Chri&s;tian&s;and, and coined into ducats. There is at pre&s;ent a very con&s;iderable &s;ilver mine worked at Kong&s;berg, on
<PB N="76" REF="850">
the account and ri&s;que of his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty: the ore is &s;urpri&s;ingly rich, but interrupted in &s;uch a manner, that the vein is often lo&s;t. Many ma&s;&s;es of pure &s;ilver have been found; and among the re&s;t one piece weighing five hundred and &s;ixty pounds, pre&s;erved in the royal mu&s;aeum at Copen|hagen. Such is the almo&s;t incredible richne&s;s of the&s;e mines, that the annual produce amounts in value to a ton and a half of gold. About five thou&s;and per&s;ons are daily employed, and earn their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, in the&s;e &s;tupendous works. Other &s;ilver mines are pro&s;ecuted at Jarl&s;berg, but not to the &s;ame advantage; and here the ore is mixed with lead and copper. In many parts of this coun|try copper mines have been di&s;covered; but the principal, and perhaps the riche&s;t in all Europe, is at Roraas, about an hundred Engli&s;h miles from Drontheim. This work yields annually about eleven hundred &s;hip-pounds of pure copper: the founderies belonging to it con&s;ume yearly about fourteen thou&s;and la&s;ts of coal, and five hundred fathoms of wood. The next, in importance, is the copper-work at Lykken, about twenty miles from Drontheim. A third mine is carried on at Ind&s;et, or Quickne, at the di&s;tance of thirty miles from the &s;ame place; and here they precipitate the cop|per from its men&s;truum, by means of iron. There is a fourth copper-work at Silboe, about thirty miles di&s;tant from Drontheim, though the lea&s;t con&s;iderable of the four. Other copper mines of le&s;s note are worked in different parts of the king|dom. Iron is &s;till in greater plenty, and was the fir&s;t metal wrought in this country. Many hun|dred thou&s;and quintals are annualy exported, chiefly in bars, and part of it in &s;toves, pots, kettles, and cannon: the national profit ari&s;ing from this metal is e&s;timated at three hundred thou&s;and rixdollars. There is a &s;pecies called moor-iron, found in large
<PB N="77" REF="860">
lumps among the mora&s;&s;es: of this the pea&s;ants make their own dome&s;tic tools and uten&s;ils, &s;uch as knives, &s;cythes, and axes. The lead, found mixed in the &s;ilver ore, is an article of &s;mall im|portance in Norway: yet &s;ome mines of this metal have been lately opened in the di&s;trict of Soloer, by the proprietors of the copper-work at Oudal. A vitriol work has been begun near Kong&s;berg: the mines yield great plenty of &s;ulphur, which however the Norwegians will not take the trouble to melt and depurate, becau&s;e immen&s;e quantities are found at a cheaper rate in the i&s;land of Iceland. Allum is found between the &s;late-&s;lakes, near Chri&s;tiania, in &s;uch plenty, that works have been &s;et up for refining this mineral, though they have not yet brought it to any degree of tran&s;parency. His Dani&s;h maje&s;ty has e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;alt-works in the penin&s;ula of Valoe, about &s;ix Engli&s;h miles from Ton&s;berg, where this mineral is extracted in large quantities from the &s;ea-water.</P>

<HEAD>ANIMALS: QUADRUPEDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Norwegian hor&s;es, though generally &s;mall, are well proportioned, &s;wift, &s;pirited, hardy, and in good condition; yet they &s;eldom ta&s;te corn, living chiefly on gra&s;s and hay. As they are &s;eldom or never gelded, their mettle is the more la&s;ting: they are not, however, very fit for draught; but they trot ea&s;ily, are &s;ure-footed, and climb the mountains with &s;urpri&s;ing agility. Such is their courage, that they will &s;ight with wolves and bears, and generally have the advantage. When the hor&s;e perceives the&s;e animals near him, while he is accompanied by a mare or a gelding, he advances before his weaker con&s;ort, and attacks his anta|goni&s;t with his fore-legs, which he u&s;es like drum|&s;ticks. If, in an encounter with a bear, he turns about to kick with his hind-legs, he is ruined; for,
<PB N="78" REF="870">
in that ca&s;e, the bear leaps upon his back, and &s;ticks fa&s;t, until he has wounded him to death.</P>
<P>The oxen and cows of Norway are of a little breed, and the&s;e la&s;t produce but a &s;mall quantity of milk; yet, in the beginning of winter, they are &s;ufficiently fat for the market; and their fle&s;h is very tender, delicate, and juicy. As the cows yield but little milk, the farmers keep the greater number. The&s;e bea&s;ts are turned out in the &s;ummer to graze, &s;ometimes at a great di&s;tance, among the rocks and mountains; and are tended by a woman &s;ervant, who lives in a hut built for the purpo&s;e, and milks them every day. In the &s;pring, when they are fir&s;t unhou&s;ed, the dairy-maid kindles a large fire in the fields, to which the cattle re&s;ort in the night, and lie round it, for the &s;ake of the warmth. In winter they are fed with dried leaves and boughs, prepared as provender; and in the &s;pring they feed upon buds, &s;prouts, and young &s;hoots. In the manor of Northland, the people, who have large fi&s;heries, mix cods heads and fi&s;h-bones among the provender, which the cows eat with a good reli&s;h; but by this food the milk is di&s;agreeably affected: nay, the Norwegian cows will greedily eat fle&s;h, and gnaw the bones with their teeth, like dogs and other carnivorous animals. The pea&s;ants admi|ni&s;ter a little &s;alt daily to their cows, and &s;ometimes regale them with pickled herrings.</P>
<P>There is a great number of &s;mall &s;heep in Nor|way, and on the little verdant i&s;lands that &s;urround the coa&s;t. The mutton is delicious, and the fleeces are profitable.</P>
<P>All the rocks are covered with goats and kids, in&s;omuch that, from Bergen alone, &s;eventy thou&s;and raw &s;kins are exported, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e which are manufactured in the country. A Norway goat is not afraid of a &s;ingle wolf: he is &s;ometimes bit
<PB N="79" REF="880">
by a &s;erpent, and, in that ca&s;e, he revenges him&s;elf by eating the aggre&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>Few hogs are reared in Norway.</P>
<P>Of dogs there is a variety, as in other nations: &s;ome are trained to watch and protect the &s;heep and cattle; &s;ome are kept as dome&s;tic guards; &s;ome are bred to bear-hunting; and &s;ome are taught to catch birds on the rocks and mountains.</P>
<P>Of cats there is plenty, both tame and wild; the&s;e la&s;t re&s;iding upon trees, and living upon bird|catching. Their &s;kins bring a good price, and are u&s;ed for winter lining.</P>
<P>The wild bea&s;ts that are natives of Norway de|&s;erve a particular de&s;cription, in the different &s;pecies of the elk, the rein-deer, the hare, the rabbit, the bear, the lynx, the glutton, the leming, the er|mine, the martin, and the beaver.</P>
<P>The elk is a tall animal, of an a&s;h colour, in &s;hape and make partaking of the hor&s;e and the &s;tag, having long legs, flat horns, and cloven hoofs. It is a harm|le&s;s creature, and lives near hou&s;es in the winter: the fle&s;h ta&s;tes like veni&s;on, and the hide is tanned into &s;trong leather.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the red deer is almo&s;t de&s;troyed by the wolves: neverthele&s;s, there are &s;till a few on the continent and in the i&s;lands. The farmers &s;hoot them in winter, pre&s;erve them in the &s;now, live upon the fle&s;h, and &s;ell the hide and horns. Sometimes &s;mall herds of the&s;e animals &s;wim over from i&s;land to i&s;land, and, when tired, re&s;t their heads upon the rumps of each other: that which is foremo&s;t, finding it&s;elf fatigued, retreats to the la&s;t; and thus they are alternately a&s;&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>The rein-deer is a &s;pecies of the &s;tag, peculiar to the&s;e northern countries; and, according to the re|peated experiment of tran&s;planting him, this crea|ture will not live in any other climate, whether the mo&s;s which he feeds upon is not to be found el&s;e|where,
<PB N="80" REF="890">
or he cannot retain his health, except in his native air.</P>
<P>Norway abounds with &s;mall hares, which, in the &s;evere &s;ea&s;on, change their colour from brown to white: they live upon mice, which they pur&s;ue under the &s;now; or, in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity, feed upon the birch-catkins.</P>
<P>Rabbits are found in a few places of this kingdom.</P>
<P>Bears appear in every part of Norway, but chiefly in the di&s;tricts of Bergen and Drontheim. This animal is generally of a dark or light brown colour, very &s;trong and &s;agacious; his great|e&s;t &s;trength re&s;iding in his fore-legs and paws. While a &s;he-bear &s;uckles her young, it is danger|ous to meet, her in the fields: at other times &s;he will fly from the human &s;pecies. One of tho&s;e women who tend the flocks, will drive a bear be|fore her with a &s;tick, and often oblige him to quit his prey: but the&s;e animals will at any time attack a woman who is pretty far advanced in pregnancy; yet there is no in&s;tance of a bear's devouring a child. He feeds occa&s;ionally on roots, gra&s;s, plants, particularly angelica, and different &s;orts of berries: but he delights mo&s;t in animal food, the fle&s;h of &s;heep, goats, cows, and hor&s;es. He a&s;|&s;aults his prey with his fore-paws, and u&s;es not his teeth until he has ma&s;tered the creature: then he &s;ucks the blood on the &s;pot, and drags the carca&s;e to his den. If the road is uphill, or difficult, he will take up the body in his arms, and walk upon his hind-legs only. He will not touch the dead carca&s;e of any animal which he him&s;elf has not killed. He corrects the wolf, which, indeed, does not like to re&s;ide in his neighbourhood. A large bear in Roy&s;und was for many years known to follow the herds as their keeper: he &s;tood tamely by the dairy-maid, while &s;he was milking the cows, and often drove the wolf away; till at the end of
<PB N="81" REF="900">
autumn, when he began to provide his winter's den, he took a kid or &s;heep, as if by agreement in lieu of wages. The Norwegian bear, from a whole flock, &s;ingles out the cow that wears the alarm-bell: he is &s;o incen&s;ed at this uten&s;il, that he often &s;trikes it flat with his paw, when it is made of hammered metal; and when it is ca&s;t, breaks it in pieces. He has been known to take a gun from the hunt&s;man, and fire it off. When he is attacked by two or three hunters, and the fir&s;t fires without wounding him mortally, he &s;eizes the man before he can load again, and, hugging him in his fore-paws, retreats backward upon his hind-legs, well knowing that the others will not fire, for fear of wounding their companion. If he finds him&s;elf mortally wounded in the neigh|bourhood of the &s;ea, or any deep water, he lays hold on a large &s;tone, with which he plunges into it, that he may &s;ink to the bottom, and deprive the hunt&s;man of his &s;kin. His broad paws being well adapted for rowing, he ventures into rivers and creeks to catch fi&s;h. When he finds him&s;elf tired with &s;wimming, and &s;pies a boat near him, he will endeavour to board it; and if his attempt &s;ucceeds, will &s;it peaceably in the &s;tern to be fer|ried over. The boatman, however, does not much reli&s;h his pa&s;&s;enger, and plies his oars lu&s;tily, that he may not be overtaken: or if he is provided with an ax, the bear's paws &s;mart for his pre&s;ump|tion. In the latter end of autumn the bear pitches upon his winter-quarters in &s;ome cave or cavern, where he prepares for him&s;elf a &s;oft bed of mo&s;s and leaves: he likewi&s;e covers up the opening with boughts in &s;uch a manner, that when the &s;now falls no entrance appears, and no &s;ign remains of an animal inclo&s;ed within. Here he is &s;eized with a deep &s;leep, or lethargic di&s;order, from which he cannot ea&s;ily be wakened, even by wounds, when
<PB N="82" REF="910">
his den is di&s;covered. If he e&s;capes detection, he will lie in a kind of &s;lumber the whole winter, without eating or drinking: but he is &s;aid to &s;uck his paws. The&s;e are certainly &s;ore and tender when he comes forth in the &s;pring, &s;o that he hops about for &s;ome time, and the hunt&s;man takes ad|vantage of his lamene&s;s. When he for&s;akes his den, he is likewi&s;e &s;ick at &s;tomach; and goes in que&s;t of an ant's hillock, which he &s;wallows at one do&s;e. This operates as a purge and &s;tomachic, &s;cours his in&s;ide, and &s;trengthens his bowels.</P>
<P>The Norway bear is hunted with &s;mall dogs, trained up to the &s;port. They never venture to grapple with him; but harra&s;s him with running about, barking, leaping, and endeavouring to &s;eize him by the genitals. When he is thus tired, he retreats to a rock, or a tree; and, &s;etting his back again&s;t it, tears up the &s;tones and earth, which he throws about him in his own defence: then the hunt&s;man fires at him with a brace of bails from a rifled gun; and if the &s;hot enters his che&s;t, his &s;houlder, or his ear, he falls imme|diately: but, if he is only &s;lightly wounded, he flies with &s;urpri&s;ing fury upon the mark&s;man, who mu&s;t defend him&s;elf with the bayonet, which is commonly fixed in the muzzle of the piece. If this implement be wanting, he &s;natches the knife or dagger, which the Norwegian farmer always wears hanging at his &s;ide by a bra&s;s chain, and holding it cro&s;s-ways in his hand, endeavours to thru&s;t it down the bear's throat. Should he mi&s;s his aim, his life is lo&s;t. The bear will flea him, and pull his &s;kin over his ears with amazing dex|terity. Sometimes, however, he beats the con|quered hunt&s;man with his paws until he appears to be dead, and then retires. If the farmer triumphs, the head of his antagoni&s;t is fixed upon his hou&s;e as a trophy. The hide will fetch five or
<PB N="83" REF="920">
&s;ix rix-dollars. The fle&s;h is eaten by the vulgar; and at every wedding a bear's ham appears as a dainty.</P>
<P>The wolves in Norway traver&s;e in troops the woods, mountains, and de&s;erts, and prey upon every creature they can conquer. In hard winters they will enter the farmer's yards, and devour his dogs, even in the kennel. The wolf, though ex|tremely fierce, is not courageous. When a deer &s;tands upon the defen&s;ive, this animal is afraid to attack him: even a cow and a goat has been known to turn again&s;t him, and put him to flight: yet he is &s;ometimes rendered &s;o bold and &s;avage by hunger, that he will attack a hor&s;e while he is drawing a &s;ledge upon the ice: for which rea&s;on the pa&s;&s;engers are always provided with &s;mall arms. As the wolf's prey is very un|certain, his organs are &s;o framed that he can fa&s;t a long time: but at length his hunger becomes &s;o intolerable, that, for want of fle&s;h, he is obliged to eat clay; which, though it appea&s;es the rage of appetite, lies undige&s;ted in his &s;tomach, until it is expelled by the force of nature, with the ex|crement of other food. This expul&s;ion is &s;o pain|ful, that he howls di&s;mally during the operation. Wolves, as well as bears in Norway, are frightened by the &s;ound of a horn, which the &s;hepherde&s;&s;es blow for that purpo&s;e. The &s;ame in&s;trument, to|gether with pipes and drums, are &s;ounded in hunt|ing the wolf. A great variety of &s;nares are laid for this animal: &s;ometimes he is blown up by a train of gunpowder; &s;ometimes &s;hot by a loaded mu&s;|ket, laid ready primed and cocked upon a car|ca&s;e: &s;ometimes he is poi&s;oned with a kind of yel|low mo&s;s, which grows upon the fir-tree; and &s;ometimes he is caught in a hole dug in the ground, and concealed by a fal&s;e cover, which, when he touches it, falls down like a trap-door,
<PB N="84" REF="930">
and &s;huts again by means of a &s;pring. In the&s;e pits the wolf is often found, with other animals which through fear he will not attack: nay, &s;ome times a pea&s;ant has been &s;een &s;itting along with him in this &s;ubterraneous pri&s;on. In order to avoid &s;uch accidents, the per&s;on who digs the &s;nare is obliged by law to give intimation of it through the whole di&s;trict.</P>
<P>The lo&s;&s;en, or lynx, is &s;maller than a wolf though as fierce and dangerous; and its &s;kin is more beautiful and valuable. There are three &s;orts of the&s;e animals in Norway, different in &s;ize: but all of the cat-kind. They have &s;harp claws formed like tho&s;e of the tyger: their backs are likewi&s;e bended, and they &s;pring upon their prey, which they can &s;ee at a great di&s;tance. They dig deep and winding habitations for them&s;elves in the earth, from whence they are driven by fire and &s;moke. They &s;eldom eat more than the head o$ udder of the &s;heep: they feed but &s;paringly during the moon's increa&s;e; but, in her wane, they are &s;aid to be more ravenous, and to bury the car|ca&s;es, like the bear, for future provi&s;ion. They are particularly &s;agacious in undermining &s;heep|folds, where they make terrible havock. And ex|perienced he-goat, perceiving a lynx at work in this manner, watched him narrowly until his head came forth: then he attacked him with his horns &s;o effectually, that he laid him dead upon the &s;pot, before he could di&s;engage his body from the earth.</P>
<P>Foxes of different colours, white, red, and black, abound in Norway. The black fur is the mo&s;t valuable: four thou&s;and fox-&s;kins are annually ex|ported from Bergen. The cunning of this animal is well known: among other &s;tratagems, the Nor|way fox catches crabs with his long bu&s;hy tail. He dips into the &s;tream, and the crab, which is
<PB N="85" REF="940">
naturally fond of any hairy &s;ub&s;tance, laying fa&s;t hold of it, he draws him a&s;hore. When he per|ceives the otter employed in fi&s;hing, he hides him|&s;elf behind a &s;tone; and the fi&s;her coming a&s;hore to eat his prey, &s;prings upon him all of a &s;udden. The otter is not afraid of the fox; but &s;o di&s;con|certed by the &s;urprize, that he quits his booty and runs away. The fox will lay a parcel of cods heads in a heap, and conceal him&s;elf behind it, until he has the opportunity of catching the fir&s;t crow that comes to feed upon them.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t remarkable quadrupeds in Norway is the erven, or vielfras, which &s;ignifies the glutton: in &s;hape and &s;ize it re&s;embles a turn|&s;pit dog, having a long body, thick legs, with &s;harp claws and teeth. His fur is variegated, and &s;hines like dama&s;k, being very fine and pre|cious; in&s;omuch that he is &s;hot with blunt ar|rows, that the &s;kin may not be injured. The erven is extremely bold and ravenous, and of &s;uch an in&s;atiable appetite, that he will eat a whole carca&s;e much bigger than him&s;elf. When he finds him&s;elf gorged, he &s;queezes him&s;elf be|tween two trees &s;tanding clo&s;e together, and exo|nerates his &s;tomach; and while he is in this con|dition, he is the mo&s;t ea&s;ily taken. Should he be taken alive, and chained to a wall, he will eat the very &s;tones and mortar.</P>
<P>The marten, or haaren, re&s;embles a great brown fore&s;t cat: its bite is &s;evere, and it &s;mells di&s;|agreeably; neverthele&s;s, the &s;kin has a fine glo&s;s, and is very valuable. It lives in hollow trees, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ts upon wild mice and birds, which it pur|&s;ues by leaping from bough to bough.</P>
<P>Norway is likewi&s;e productive of &s;quirrels, which are &s;hot with blunt arrows, or taken in &s;nares. This creature will embark on a piece of wood, floating in a &s;mall lake or river. It will hoi&s;t its
<PB N="86" REF="950">

<P>The ermin, or hermelin, which is a kind $$ weazle, re&s;ides in the clefts of rocks, and amon$ heaps of &s;tones. The nature of his elegant f$$ needs no de&s;cription. The&s;e animals hunt mice but they delight chiefly in eggs: for which rea&s;on they &s;wim in calm weather to the little i&s;land$ where the water-fowl hatch their young. Th$ ermin will &s;ometimes de&s;troy the elk, or the bea$ by creeping into his ear while he lies a&s;leep, an$ fa&s;tening upon it with his &s;harp teeth. The land$ animal is then without re&s;ource: he runs about roaring until he is quite exhau&s;ted; at length h$ faints, and dies. The ermin is likewi&s;e &s;aid t$ kill the large&s;t eagle, by &s;tealing upon his back i$ the &s;ame manner. The bird feeling him&s;elf thu$ attacked, flies away, while the ermin continue$ gnawing, until, in con&s;equence of the effu&s;ion o$ blood, the bird drops down dead upon the ground&punc; The ermin &s;tinks like the pole-cat; yet he is $$ cleanly, that, according to report, he will rather run through the fire than pa&s;s through any mu$$ or dirt, that might defile his white and preciou$ covering.

<P>Among the Norwegian quadrupeds we numbe$ the beaver or ca&s;tor, the otter, the badger or brock$ the hedge-hog, the mole, the wood and water rat$ the mou&s;e, and the leming or lumhund, which la&s;t is peculiar to the&s;e northern countries. The beaver &s;hall be particularly de&s;cribed in our account of North America. The otter is well known to live in holes, and &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon fi&s;hing: the eagle and crow attend his meals, and are content to eat his leavings. This creature, when young, may be tamed, and taught to fi&s;h for its ma&s;ter. The mole frequently takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the bear's den,
<PB N="87" REF="960">
and, by means of his prickles, proves &s;uch a trou|ble&s;ome gue&s;t, that the right owner, who cannot do him&s;elf ju&s;tice on an adver&s;ary &s;o fortified again&s;t his re&s;entment, is obliged to quit his lodgings. But the mo&s;t &s;ingular of all the&s;e animals is the lemming, the native country of which is &s;aid to be the mountains of Kolen in Lapland. This creature &s;eems to be a &s;pecies of the rat, with a &s;hort tail, very &s;hort legs, large whi&s;kers, &s;mall eyes and ears, and long &s;harp teeth. About once or twice in twenty years they appear in va&s;t num|bers, advancing along the ground, and devouring every thing that is green, like a pe&s;tilence. Some flocks of them march from the Kolen, through Nordland and Finmark, to the we&s;tern ocean, which they enter, and, after having &s;wam about for &s;ome time, peri&s;h. Other bodies take their route through Swedi&s;h Lapland to the Sinus Both|nicus, where they drown in the &s;ame manner. They advance in a direct line; and if they are obliged to go round a large &s;tone or rock, they &s;eek their former line of direction, in which they proceed. If they are oppo&s;ed by the pea&s;ants, they will &s;tand and bark at them: neverthele&s;s, great numbers of them are de&s;troyed and eaten by the Lapland dogs. If a boat happens to be in their way, lying in a river or creek which they intend to pa&s;s, they march in at one end or &s;ide of the ve&s;&s;el, and out at the other. The appearance of the&s;e vermin is looked upon as an omen of a bad harve&s;t, and heretofore there was a form of exorci&s;m u&s;ed again&s;t them by the Romi&s;h clergy: but if they progno&s;ticate a &s;canty crop, they make amends in occa&s;ioning a good hunting &s;ea&s;on; for they are followed by great numbers of bears, foxes, and other animals, which eat them as the mo&s;t de|licious food. The common people &s;uppo&s;e that the&s;e vermin are tran&s;ported through the air; and

<HEAD>INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>Among the reptiles, in&s;ects, and venomous creatures found in Norway, we reckon &s;nakes of different colours, that live upon the land, water|&s;nakes, lizzards, toads, frogs, &s;nails, gra&s;hoppers, plow-worms, &s;low-worms, clu&s;ter-worms peculiar to this country, centipes, and frog-worms, brought thither by the we&s;t wind in the &s;ummer. They fall on trees and greens, and de&s;troy the vegeta|tion: the honey dew is likewi&s;e impregnated with in&s;ects, or their eggs: a third &s;ort, larger and more mi&s;chievous, falls down with the &s;now in the &s;pring, con&s;umes every thing that is green, and is con&s;i|dered as a plague, or the in&s;trument of divine ven|geance. Norway al&s;o produces the &s;pider, the caterpillar, the butterfly, common fly, gnat, wood|lou&s;e, flea, beetle, and ant. The water too has its beetle and red worms; which la&s;t &s;warm on the coa&s;t of the we&s;tern ocean. They re&s;emble the fine&s;t &s;ewing &s;ilk, are about half an inch in length, and do infinite damage to the fi&s;hery, by fixing upon the roes of the herring. There is another pernicious &s;ea-in&s;ect, called the bear-fi&s;h, about an inch long, which fa&s;tens on the cod while he hangs upon the hook, and &s;ucks his fat and juices in &s;uch a manner as to render him &s;carce eatable. The &s;almon is likewi&s;e per&s;ecuted by a kind of flat lice, &s;omething like bugs, which in&s;inuate them|&s;elves between his fins, and drive him up rivers to water-falls, where he may have the opportunity of being wa&s;hed clean of this vermin. The &s;ea|beaver is another larger in&s;ect, peculiar to the north &s;ea: this is the &s;ame with the Mediterranean hippo-campus, cavallo marino, or &s;ea-hor&s;e, &s;o called from the figure of its head, which re&s;embles
<PB N="89" REF="980">
that of an hor&s;e: the body is vermicular, and &s;ometimes extends to the length of five or &s;ix inches. The &s;ea, in this latitude, produces like|wi&s;e a remarkable worm, for which there is no name: it is as long and thick as an ordinary finger, of a white colour, without head or tail, having an opening at one end, which probably &s;erves as a canal both to the aliment and excre|ment. Finally, we may add the little in&s;ect ge|nerated in the conchae avitificae, that &s;tick to the &s;ides and bottoms of &s;hips, and are known by the name of barnacles.</P>

<HEAD>BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>Be&s;ides the birds common to other European countries, &s;uch as the dunghill fowls, the grow&s;e, the quail, the corncrake, finches, pidgeons, &s;nipes, the thru&s;h, the owzle, the nightingale, the eagle, the hawk, the kite, the heron, the raven, cormo|rant, cuckow, bat, &amp;c. the &s;ea-coa&s;ts of Nor|way are over&s;pread with innumerable flights of aquatic fowls, that build among the rocks and cliffs in the i&s;lands and on the continent, and feed upon fi&s;h or &s;ea-weed. Among the&s;e we enu|merate a great variety of wild gee&s;e and ducks; the alk, a bird peculiar to this country, that builds in the mo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible rocks, flying in &s;uch num|bers as even to darken the air, while the noi&s;e of their wings is like the roaring of a &s;torm; the berg-ugle; the bafiar, not larger than the thru&s;h; the &s;trand-&s;neppe, the gagl, the hav-aare, the hav-he&s;t, the hav-&s;ule; the imber, or great northern diver; the jo-fugl, the krage, the krykkie, the lax-tite, the lom, the gull or maage, the &s;avor|ren, the &s;kare or loon, the &s;kue, the tre&s;t, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The common people among the Norwegians, who live near the &s;ea-coa&s;t, are employed at one &s;ea&s;on of the year in climbing the &s;teep rocks, with equal
<PB N="90" REF="990">
danger, &s;kill, and intrepidity, to catch the&s;e airy inhabitants. Their fle&s;h, feathers, down, and eggs, afford a good maintenance to tho&s;e pea&s;ants, over and above the extraordinary crops of gra&s;s pro|duced from their dung upon the i&s;lands. Some of the eggs are as good as hen-eggs, and great quan|tities are carried to market: the meat, though in general it has a fi&s;hy ta&s;te, is parboiled in vinegar, or pickled for the tables of the common people: but the principal advantage is yielded by the fea|thers and down, which are annually &s;old to the merchants at Bergen. In &s;ome of the Nordland di&s;tricts, the farmers train dogs to &s;pring the &s;hore and &s;trand birds from their holes, which are almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. The&s;e are auxiliaries to the bird-men or climbers, who either &s;cramble up the face of perpendicular rocks with the mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing cou|rage and dexterity, or are lowered down by ropes, &s;ometimes above one hundred fathom, over pro|jecting precipices. Some of the birds will allow them&s;elves to be &s;eized in their ne&s;ts; others are taken in a net, fixed to the end of a pole, which the bird-man applies to the mouths of the holes from whence they take their flight. In climbing up the rocks, two bird-men tie them&s;elves toge|ther with a rope of a moderate length. The fir&s;t being pu&s;hed up by the other's pole to a proper &s;tanding-place, or projection, fixes him&s;elf to the rock; and the &s;econd clambers up, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the rope which is tied round the wai&s;t of his fellow. In this manner they proceed alternately until they arrive at the birding places: but &s;ometimes, in &s;pite of all their &s;kill and precaution, one &s;lips, and dragging the other after him, both peri&s;h. Some per&s;ons al&s;o lo&s;e their lives yearly, in the other operation of de&s;cending from the &s;ummits: loo&s;e fragments of the rock, being moved in the de&s;cent, &s;ometimes fall upon and kill the bird|man;
<PB N="91" REF="1000">
and &s;ometimes the rope being cut by the &s;harp-pointed &s;tones, he is precipitated and da&s;hed in pieces among the rocks.</P>
<P>Before we leave this article of birds, it may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that Norway produces two very remarkable birds, namely, the nord-wind's-pipe, of a grey colour, &s;omething le&s;s than a &s;tarling, which makes a particular noi&s;e before the north wind begins to blow; and the &s;ouden-wind's-fugl, or &s;outh wind-fowl, which never ap|pears but before a &s;outherly wind. At the head of the game-fowl in this country is the tiur, urae|gallus major, or cock of the wood, of a black or dark-grey colour, with &s;ome red about the eyes. He is the large&s;t of all the eatable birds, and re|&s;embles the wild turkey-cock in the bill and feet. The Norwegian eagle is &s;o large and &s;trong, that he has been known to carry away a child two years old. The land-eagle preys upon land-animals; &s;uch as hares, lambs, kids, and &s;heep, exclu&s;ive of birds: but the fi&s;h-eagle, which is larger than the other, lives chiefly on the produce of the &s;ea and rivers. When he &s;trikes a fi&s;h at &s;ea with his talons, which are long, &s;harp, and crooked, &s;o as that he cannot ea&s;ily di&s;engage him&s;elf, he is &s;ome|times dragged down to the bottom by the &s;trength of his antagoni&s;t: he generally meets with this misfortune when he &s;trikes the fi&s;h helleflynder, who&s;e back is high and prominent, and appears a little above the &s;urface. In the neighbourhood of Bergen, an eagle, &s;tanding on the bank of a river, perceived a &s;almon clo&s;e by the edge: he forth-with &s;truck the talons of one foot into the root of an elm, and darted tho&s;e of the other into the &s;al|mon, which, being large and &s;trong, &s;prung away with &s;uch force, that the eagle was &s;plit and torn a&s;under. The &s;wallows in Norway, about the lat|ter end of autumn, take wing in large flights, and
<PB N="92" REF="1010">
plunge them&s;elves into fre&s;h-water lakes, generally among reeds and bu&s;hes, where they remain all the winter in a &s;tate of in&s;en&s;ibility, and revive again in the &s;pring. Whole flocks of them, in this benumbed condition, have been found by fi&s;hermen coupled together, with their legs and bills intangled. If brought into a warm apart|ment, they will in half an hour begin to move; in a little more time they will flutter, and even fly about; yet in le&s;s than an hour they die outright.</P>

<HEAD>FISHES.</HEAD>
<P>The rivers and fre&s;h-water lakes in Norway af|ford the eel, the lamprey, the perch, the bleak, the bream, the elveritze, the gedde, the &s;audert, the trout, the &s;almon, the &s;almon-trout, the hor, the karud&s;e, the kollie, the krokle, the kullebars, the dove, the &s;iik, the &s;kale, or alburnus, the &s;turgeon, &amp;c. The northern ocean is the great repo&s;itory for fi&s;h of all kinds, and &s;ea-animals, which &s;warm in myriads near the Pole; &s;ome for the convenience of prey, and others for the benefit of protection yielded by perennial bulwarks of ice. Under this cover the herring, cod, mackarel, whiting, &amp;c. breed without mole&s;tation from the unwieldy whale, who, on account of his re&s;pira|tion, will not venture far below the ice. Never|thele&s;s, tho&s;e kinds of fi&s;h which are generated of &s;pawn, approach the coa&s;ts of Norway annually, and di&s;charge their &s;pawn in narrow creeks and channels. The &s;ea, in the&s;e parts, abounds with the rock-fi&s;h, the blue-fi&s;h, the blanken&s;teen, the herring, the anchovy, the fin-fi&s;h, the bro&s;mer, the fi&s;kekong, the flounder, plaice, turbot, thorn|back, helle-flynder, hollibut, maids, and &s;oles, the flying-fi&s;h, &s;harks of various kinds, the horn-fi&s;h, or muraena, the whiting, the mackarel, the gur|nard, the cod, the ling, the herring, the haddock,

the needle-fi&s;h, the raate or &s;ea-carp, the razor|fi&s;h, the rod-fi&s;h, the &s;quare-fi&s;h or o&s;tracion, the lyr, the &s;ey, the &s;ea-cat, the &s;oly-fi&s;h, the &s;tone|biter or lupus, the &s;word-fi&s;h, the &s;ea-hor&s;e, the &s;ea-&s;corpion, the whale, the grampus, the naraval or &s;ea-unicorn, the porcpi&s;ce, the &s;eale or &s;ea-calf, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Some of the mo&s;t &s;triking peculiarities ob|&s;ervable in the&s;e different &s;pecies, well de&s;erve our attention. There is one &s;pecies of the &s;hark, called haac-moeren, ten fathoms in length, who&s;e liver yields three ca&s;ks of train-oil. The helle|flynder, or large turbot, which will cover a broad table, has been known to exhibit &s;ymptoms of re|venge again&s;t mankind. A fi&s;herman, in &s;triking at one of the&s;e animals, chanced to fall overboard, and &s;unk to the bottom in two or three fathoms water. The helle-flynder immediately de&s;cended, and &s;pread his huge body upon the man to keep him from ri&s;ing; and in that po&s;ture he remained, until his companions, who &s;aw what pa&s;&s;ed, drove away the fi&s;h with their boat-hooks.</P>
<P>Of the whale kind there are &s;even different &s;pecies: all of them follow the &s;hoals of herrings, and other &s;mall fi&s;h, to the coa&s;ts of Norway; and when the pea&s;ant ob&s;erves them, at the di&s;tance of &s;everal miles, &s;pouting up the water through the openings in their heads, he joyfully hails the &s;ignal of the approaching fi&s;hery. Some thou&s;ands of the&s;e whales appear &s;tretching along the coa&s;t, from Karm&s;und to Chri&s;tian&s;and in the dioce&s;e of Tron|theim, an extent of three hundred and &s;ixty miles. The large whale &s;ometimes over-&s;hoots him&s;elf, runs a-ground, and expires: then he is found &s;tretched to the length of &s;eventy feet, and be|comes the property of him who owns the land. He pretty much re&s;embles a cod, with &s;mall eyes, a &s;mooth, dark, marbled &s;kin, white under the
<PB N="94" REF="1030">
belly. Through the two holes or openings in the head, the&s;e creatures &s;pout out the water which they take in in&s;piration; for their lungs are formed like tho&s;e of any other animal. Their throats are very narrow, in proportion to their &s;ize: their tails are horizontal; and they copulate like land-ani|mals, &s;tanding upright in the &s;ea. The female brings forth one or two at a birth, about nine or ten feet long when fir&s;t produced. The&s;e &s;uck the teats of the mother, who, when they are tired with &s;wimming, takes them between her great fins, and conveys them from place to place. Un|der the &s;kin the whale is covered with two or three feet thickne&s;s of fat, the blubber from which the oil is extracted. The fle&s;h is of a redi&s;h colour, accounted very coar&s;e food, though &s;ometimes eaten: but the tongue and tail are admired as dainties. An old whale is attended with a di&s;|agreeable &s;cent, owing to weeds, mu&s;cles, and other foulne&s;&s;es that gather and &s;tick to his back. He feeds upon &s;mall in&s;ects, not larger than flies, that float in myriads upon the water. He likewi&s;e devours a great variety of &s;mall fi&s;h, particularly herrings and cod, which he drives together in great &s;hoals, and &s;wallows in &s;uch prodigious quan|tities, that his belly is di&s;tended almo&s;t to bur&s;t|ing. When this is the ca&s;e, he roars hideou&s;ly with pain. The &s;ame noi&s;e, re&s;embling a clap of thunder, he makes when he is pur&s;ued by his ene|mies, or frightened by falling into the nets of fi&s;hermen, which, however, he carries off with great facility. The whale is a timorous animal; and, when he approaches a boat, may be ea&s;ily &s;cared away by &s;triking on the gunwale with an oar. At the time of their pairing, however, they are &s;aid to be more bold and dangerous.&mdash;For the manner of catching whales, and an account of

<P>The whale is per&s;ecuted by a variety of fi&s;h and fowl. The thre&s;her fa&s;tens on his back, and beats him without cea&s;ing; while another fi&s;h, with &s;harp horns on his back, a&s;&s;aults him from below, and &s;ometimes tears open his belly. The tuke|fi&s;h, or &s;epia, is &s;aid to burrow in his fle&s;h. The &s;pekhuggeren, a fi&s;h about four feet long, a kind of porcpi&s;ce, provided with very long and &s;harp teeth, bites and tears the fle&s;h from the whale's body; and, when he comes up to the &s;urface, he is attacked by divers birds of prey. Thus tortured, he bellows dreadfully, and leaps &s;o as to rai&s;e him|&s;elf perpendicular above the &s;urface of the &s;ea: then he plunges down again with &s;uch violence, that if his head &s;trikes again&s;t a hidden rock, where the water is not deep, his &s;kull is fractured, and he comes floating up a dead carca&s;e. Be&s;ides this great whale, a va&s;t number of a &s;maller kind, vi&s;it the coa&s;t of Norway in different forms, and are by the fi&s;hermen frightened and driven a&s;hore, where they peri&s;h.</P>
<P>The &s;eale, or phocas, is an animal &s;o well known that it needs no de&s;cription. They re&s;ide in caverns and upon rocks in the north-&s;ea, where they are &s;een in thou&s;ands. They litter on &s;hore twice a year; and great numbers of them are caught &s;leeping on the flakes of ice near the coa&s;t of Groenland. They are ea&s;ily &s;urpri&s;ed and killed by the fi&s;hermen, who &s;trike them with a &s;tick over the no&s;e. The fat, which is flea'd off with the &s;kin, the fi&s;hermen barrel up in ca&s;ks for train|oil: the &s;kins being &s;prinkled with &s;alt, are rolled up &s;ingly. One &s;hip has been known to carry off eight hundred ca&s;ks of &s;eal-fat in a &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The female &s;almon ejects its roe at the mouths of rivers, through an aperture under the belly:
<PB N="96" REF="1050">
during this operation &s;he bends her body, and thru&s;ts her head into the &s;and. The male coming after|wards, bends his head towards the tail, and di&s;|charges his &s;pawn upon the other's roe. All the different &s;pecies of fi&s;h, that have roes, probably breed in the &s;ame manner.</P>
<P>The herrings annually vi&s;it the we&s;tern coa&s;t of Norway, chiefly Nordland, in &s;uch amazing &s;warms as exceed all belief. The innumerable &s;hoal that comes forth from their &s;helter under the ice at the North Pole, divide them&s;elves into three bodies about the latitude of Iceland. One of the&s;e directs its cour&s;e to the we&s;tward, &s;teering round the He|brides and coa&s;t of Scotland, towards Newfound|land: the &s;econd cour&s;es round the ea&s;tern part of Great-Britain, down the Channel; and the third, keeping to the left along the coa&s;t of Norway, enters through the Sound into the Baltic. The herring and cod are driven in &s;hoals upon the coa&s;t by the great herring-whale; and as he dares not venture in between the i&s;lands and the rocks, he remains about &s;ix weeks watching for their re|turn, on the back of a great &s;and-bank parallel to the &s;hore, extending about three hundred Engli&s;h miles in length. In the mean time the &s;harks, porcpi&s;ces, and &s;maller fi&s;h of prey, pur&s;ue the cod and herrings along &s;hore into inlets and creeks, where they croud in &s;uch a manner, that they may be taken up in pail-fulls. A &s;hoal not only ex|tends a con&s;iderable way in length and breadth, but al&s;o reaches from the bottom to the &s;urface, even in the depth of two hundred fathoms. Se|veral hundred &s;hip-loads of pickled herrings are yearly exported from Bergen only, be&s;ides the great quantity con&s;umed at home by the common people. The large&s;t and fatte&s;t appear upon the coa&s;t from Chri&s;tmas to Candlemas. At that &s;ea|&s;on the country-people a&s;&s;emble on the &s;hore by
<PB N="97" REF="1060">
thou&s;ands, with their fi&s;hing-tackle, boats, ca&s;ks, and &s;alt. In the compa&s;s of one mile three hun|dred boats may be &s;een employed a whole month, without intermi&s;&s;ion. In each not, about twenty feet long, the fi&s;hermen will often catch five thou|&s;and large herrings. At one &s;ingle ca&s;t the fi&s;her|man frequently takes more than he can di&s;po&s;e of. At Sundifiord ten thou&s;and ton are &s;aid to have been taken at one haul. There is likewi&s;e a &s;um|mer vi&s;itation, con&s;i&s;ting of large and &s;mall her|rings, which are likewi&s;e caught in &s;urpri&s;ing num|bers. The fat and large kind are pickled and ex|ported: the other &s;ort are con&s;umed by the pea|&s;ants.</P>
<P>The cod, ling, kabeliau, and tor&s;k, follow the herrings to feed upon their &s;pawn. They are caught in large &s;trong nets, four hundred fathoms long, in fifty or &s;ixty fathoms water; and &s;ome|times they are taken by long lines: on each of the&s;e are fixed two or three hundred hooks, baited with herring; and when the line is drawn, a fi&s;h is frequently found hanging to every hook. The cod, being thus taken in great numbers, are either pickled with French and Spani&s;h &s;alt, or dried in different ways, and exported to Bremen, Ham|burgh, and Am&s;terdam. Many thou&s;and ca&s;ks of the roe, &s;alted, are &s;old annually to the French, who &s;trew it in the &s;ea by way of bait, when they catch a &s;ort of fi&s;h, called &s;ardeller, &s;omething like herrings. A great quantity of train-oil is extracted from the cod's liver; and the &s;ounds are dried, and barrelled up for exportation.</P>
<P>The cod and herring-fi&s;hery of Norway em|ploys and maintains above one hundred and fifty thou&s;and people.</P>
<P>The rana pi&s;catrix, or &s;ea-devil, is &s;ometimes &s;een on this coa&s;t, about &s;ix feet in length. The head makes above one half of the fi&s;h: the body

tapers into a &s;harp-pointed tail, the eyes are large, and the jaws, wide and horrible, &s;et with different rows of &s;harp teeth: the tongue is likewi&s;e fur|ni&s;hed with teeth, or &s;harp protuberances, &s;o that his bite is terrible; and all round the under-jaw, which projects beyond the upper, there are hang|ing &s;lips, or gri&s;tly fins, about four inches long. The &s;ea-devil, fixing him&s;elf at the edge of a rock, opens his jaws very wide, and lies in wait for his prey.

He is ex|tremely voracious, and has been known to de&s;troy a man that was bathing in the &s;ea, by &s;eizing his genitals, and dragging him to the bottom.</P>
<P>The &s;corpio marinus, or &s;ea-&s;corpion, found on this coa&s;t, is a fi&s;h about four feet long, with a head larger than the whole body, of a hideous a&s;pect, wide mouth, mon&s;trous jaws, and &s;mall &s;cales of a redi&s;h colour. It is a voracious animal, and its bite is &s;aid to be poi&s;onous.</P>

<HEAD>EXANGUIOUS FISHES.</HEAD>
<P>Of exanguious fi&s;h, whether cru&s;taceous, te&s;ta|ceous, or in&s;ect, there is a great variety in the Norwegian &s;ea. Among the&s;e we number oy&s;ters, cockles, and mu&s;cles, lob&s;ters, crabs, &s;hrimps, &s;ea|hedgehogs, &s;cuttle-fi&s;h, different kinds of &s;tar-fi&s;h, the wilk, the &s;ea-&s;nail, the hermit-fi&s;h, the &s;epia, loligo or ink-fi&s;h, the urtica marina, or &s;ea-nettle, the pearl-band, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The rock-oy&s;ters of Norway are large and delicious. The crab and &s;tar-fi&s;h feeds upon the common oy&s;ter: when the &s;hell is open at low-water, the crab throws in a &s;tone to keep it from clo&s;ing, and then the creature be|comes an ea&s;y prey. The fox, notwith&s;tanding
<PB N="99" REF="1080">
his boa&s;ted &s;agacity, is often taken pri&s;oner by the oy&s;ter, by putting his paw or his tongue into the &s;hell, which in&s;tantly clo&s;es: thus he is detained, and &s;ometimes drowned by the &s;pring-tides.</P>
<P>On the we&s;t-&s;ide of Norway the pearl-mu&s;cle is found in &s;everal brooks and rivers. The right of this fi&s;hery belongs to the king of Denmark, and is carried on at his expence. The pearls, which are annually taken about Mid&s;ummer, become the property of the queen, as part of the regalia of Norway. Some of the&s;e Norwegian pearls are of a good lu&s;tre, little inferior to tho&s;e of the Ea&s;t; but the number of the&s;e is very incon&s;iderable. Thirty or forty lob&s;ter-bu&s;&s;es, from London and Am&s;terdam, are loaded every Spring in the ports of Norway. Every bu&s;s is provided with a well, pierced with holes, to let in the &s;ea-water, and large enough to contain ten thou&s;and lob&s;ters: their claws are tied up with packthread, that they may not fight and maim one another. The Nor|wegian cray-fi&s;h, found in the rivers of Agger|huus, is different from that of other countries.</P>
<P>If we may believe the te&s;timony of many cre|ditable Norwegians, the northern ocean produces &s;ome very extraordinary animals, the exi&s;tence of which has been doubted by mankind in general; namely, the mer-man and mer-maid, the great &s;ea-&s;nake, and the kraken or korven. The mer|man and mer-maid are &s;ea-animals, that bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to the human form. In the year 1719, one of the males of this &s;pecies was found dead on a point of land in Nordland. His colour was of a dark grey; the face re&s;embled that of a man, with a large mouth and flat no&s;e: the arms were attached to the &s;ide by a thin membrane, and terminated in paws like tho&s;e of the &s;ea-calf: the body tapered into a fi&s;h's tail, like that of a porc|pi&s;ce; and the length extended to three fathoms.
<PB N="100" REF="1090">
The mer-maid is formed in the &s;ame manner, bating the difference of &s;ex, which is di&s;tingui&s;hed like that of the human race. The&s;e creatures have been &s;een in many different parts of the north &s;ea, and have appeared of various magnitude, from two feet to three fathoms.</P>
<P>In the year 1723, three fi&s;hermen of El&s;eneur, in Denmark, being examined upon oath before the privy coun&s;ellor Frederick Van Gram, de|clared, that in the month of July, in calm weather, between Hveen and Saedland, they approached in their boat &s;omething that floated on the &s;urface like a dead body, which lay without motion, until they were within &s;even or eight fathoms of it; then &s;unk in&s;tantaneou&s;ly, and ro&s;e again nearly in the &s;ame place. There he &s;tood a quarter of an hour &s;taring at them, and was &s;een above the water, down to his brea&s;t. They being terrified at &s;ight of this mon&s;ter, began to row away: then he blew up his cheeks, uttered a kind of muttering roar, and dived under water. He appeared like an old man, with broad &s;houlders, and a &s;mall head, co|vered with &s;hort black curled hair. His eyes were hollow, his face was meagre and weather-beaten, and his chin furni&s;hed with a black bu&s;hy beard, that looked as if it had been cut: his &s;kin was coar&s;e and hairy. One of the&s;e deponents further declared, that about twenty years before he had &s;een a mer-maid, with long hair and large brea&s;ts.</P>
<P>The mar-miele, or mar-mate, belongs to the &s;ame cla&s;s, and is perhaps the young of this family. It is found of different &s;izes, and often caught on hooks by the fi&s;hermen of Norway. Some are no bigger than infants half a year old; others are as large as children of three years. The pea&s;ants are &s;aid to carry them home to their hou&s;es, and regale them with milk, in hope they will foretel
<PB N="101" REF="1100">
&s;omething favourable in return for their entertain|ment: but they never detain them longer than four and twenty hours, &s;uper&s;titiou&s;ly believing them&s;elves bound to row back to &s;ea with them, and relea&s;e them near the &s;pot where they were taken.</P>
<P>The &s;ea-&s;nake is &s;aid to be peculiar to the Nor|wegian &s;ea, where it has been &s;een by many hun|dreds of people, mariners, fi&s;hermen, and others. In the year 1746, captain Laurence de Ferry, of Bergen, &s;hot at a &s;ea-&s;nake, which immediately di&s;appeared; and when the boat was rowed near the place, the water appeared tinged with blood. The head of this animal, which it held at lea&s;t two feet above the &s;urface of the water, was of a greyi&s;h colour, and re&s;embled the head of a hor&s;e. The mouth was very large and black; the eyes were of the &s;ame colour; and a long white main hung down from its neck, and floated on the &s;ea. Be&s;ides the head, they &s;aw &s;even or eight coils of this &s;nake, about the di&s;tance of a fathom one from another.</P>
<P>In Egede's journal of the Greenland mi&s;&s;ion, we find, that on the 6th day of July, 1734, a large and frightful &s;ea-mon&s;ter rai&s;ed it&s;elf &s;o high out of the water, that its head reached above the main|top-ma&s;t of the &s;hip: that it had a long &s;harp &s;nout, broad paws, and &s;pouted water like a whale: that the body &s;eemed to be covered with &s;cales; the &s;kin was uneven and wrinkled, and the lower part was formed like a &s;nake. It plunged it&s;elf backwards in the water, and the rai&s;ed its tail above the &s;ur|face a whole &s;hip's length from the head. Though the exact dimen&s;ions of the &s;ea-&s;nake cannot be a&s;certained, we may conclude, from the concurring te&s;timony of tho&s;e who have &s;een it at &s;ea, that he is an hundred fathoms in length; and that his body is as large as a hog&s;head. His &s;kin, unlike that of
<PB N="102" REF="1110">
the Greenland mon&s;ter, is &s;mooth without wrinkle, of a dark-brown colour, &s;peckled and variegated like tortoi&s;e-&s;hell; and this &s;kin he is &s;aid to &s;hed annually. That his &s;en&s;e of &s;melling is very acute, the fi&s;hermen conjecture from the circum&s;tance of his avoiding the &s;cent of ca&s;tor; a quantity of which they therefore provide them&s;elves with, when they go out to fi&s;h in the Summer, and when they meet with the &s;ea-&s;nake, they throw a &s;mall por|tion of it over-board. This huge animal is &s;aid to have &s;unk or overturned many large ve&s;&s;els, and even to have rai&s;ed him&s;elf up and &s;natched men out of boats. The fi&s;hermen practi&s;e different methods of avoiding this calamity, be&s;ides the ex|periment of ca&s;tor: they &s;ometimes row full again&s;t tho&s;e volumes of him that appear above water, or throw a light piece of wood upon him: in that ca&s;e he dives immediately. Sometimes they tack about, in order to gain the &s;un, who&s;e beams the eyes of this creature cannot bear: but, if they are near the &s;hore, they row into creeks where they cannot be pur&s;ued. The excrement or &s;pawn of this animal, which floats upon the &s;urface like a vi&s;cid &s;lime, is &s;o corro&s;ive, that if it &s;hould touch the hands of the fi&s;herman, they will be in&s;tantly bli&s;tered and inflamed.</P>
<P>But the mo&s;t &s;urpri&s;ing creature in this &s;ea, and perhaps in the whole world, is the kraken, or kor|ven, an animal of the polypus kind, &s;eemingly a mile and a half in circumference. The Norwe|gian fi&s;hermen &s;ometimes, in a hot &s;ummer-day, find no more than twenty or thirty fathoms water, where the depth u&s;ed to be eighty or an hundred; and here they catch great plenty of cod and ling. They know the kraken is below them, and that they are fi&s;hing upon his back: when they per|ceive, by their lines, that the water grows more and more &s;hallow, they judge he is ri&s;ing &s;lowly to
<PB N="103" REF="1120">
the &s;urface, and row away with great expedition. At a proper di&s;tance they lie upon their oars, and in a few minutes part of him appears above water, like a number of &s;mall i&s;lands and &s;and-banks, covered with &s;ea-weeds, and abounding with a great variety of fi&s;h, that leap about, and roll off his &s;ides into the water. At length a great number of pellucid antennae ri&s;e upon his back, as large and as high as the ma&s;ts of moderate ve&s;&s;els: by means of the&s;e in&s;truments, or tentacula, he moves him&s;elf and gathers in his food, which con&s;i&s;ts of &s;mall fi&s;hes. After he has remained a little time at the &s;urface, he begins to &s;ink again gradually, and this motion produces a dangerous &s;well and whirlpool in the water. A few years ago two fi&s;hermen, near Frederick&s;tadt, had the misfortune to be left aground on the back of a kraken, and their boat was cru&s;hed to pieces by one of his an|tennae; neverthele&s;s they e&s;caped upon the wreck. In the year 1680, a young kraken intangled it&s;elf among the rocks and cliffs in the pari&s;h of Al&s;ta|hong, and there it peri&s;hed. The carca&s;e putre|fying, filled that narrow channel with &s;uch a &s;tench, that for a long time it was impa&s;&s;able. In all pro|bability the floating i&s;lands, which have been de|&s;cribed by &s;o many voyage-writers, were no other than the back of this huge mon&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>PEOPLE: their LANGUAGE, RELIGION, LAWS, and GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Many Dani&s;h, Engli&s;h, Scotch, Dutch, and Ger|man families have &s;ettled in Norway, and now form no incon&s;iderable part of the trading people: but the original inhabitants are the de&s;cendants of tho&s;e ferocious Normanni, who harra&s;&s;ed almo&s;t all the coa&s;ts of Europe with piratical armaments in the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries. They &s;peak the &s;ame language that is u&s;ed in Denmark,
<PB N="104" REF="1130">
though their original tongue is the dialect now &s;poken in Iceland. They profe&s;s the Lutheran re|ligion, under an archbi&s;hop e&s;tabli&s;hed at Dron|theim, with four &s;uffragans; namely, of Bergen, Staffanger, Hammer, and Chri&s;tiania. By the union of Calmar, the two kingdoms of Norway and Denmark were united under one monarch; and then the people of both nations enjoyed con&s;iderable pri|vileges: but the Dani&s;h government is now become ab&s;olute, and Norway is ruled de&s;potically by a viceroy, who re&s;ides in the capital, and pre&s;ides in the &s;upreme court, to which appeals are made from the &s;ubordinate courts of judicature.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHARACTER of the PEOPLE: their MAN|NERS, CUSTOMS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The Norwegians are generally well-formed, tall, &s;turdy and robu&s;t, brave, hardy, hone&s;t, ho&s;pitable, and ingenious; yet &s;avage, ra&s;h, quarrel&s;ome, and litigious. The &s;ame character will nearly &s;uit the inhabitants of every mountainous country in the northern climates. Their women are well-&s;haped, tall, comely, remarkably fair and obliging. The nobility of Norway have been chiefly removed by the kings of Denmark, in order to prevent faction, and oppo&s;ition to the court; or are long ago de|generated into the rank of pea&s;ants: &s;ome fami|lies, however, have been lately rai&s;ed to that dig|nity. Every freeholder in Norway enjoys the right of primogeniture, and power of redemption; and it is very u&s;ual to &s;ee a pea&s;ant inhabiting the &s;ame hou&s;e which has been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed four hundred years by his ance&s;tors. The odels-gads, or freehold, cannot be alienated by &s;ale, or otherwi&s;e, from the right heir, called odels-mand: if he is not able to redeem the e&s;tate, he declares his incapacity every tenth year at the &s;e&s;&s;ions; and if he, or his heirs, to the third generation, &s;hould acquire wealth
<PB N="105" REF="1140">
enough for that purpo&s;e, the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or <HI>pro tempore</HI> mu&s;t re&s;ign his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The mountaineers acquire &s;urpri&s;ing &s;trength and dexterity by hard living, cold, laborious ex|erci&s;e, climbing rocks, &s;kating on the &s;now, and handling arms, which they carry from their youth, to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the wild bea&s;ts of the fore&s;ts. Tho&s;e who dwell in the maritime parts of Norway exerci&s;e the employments of fi&s;hing and navigation, and become very expert mariners.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants of Norway never employ any handicraft&s;men for nece&s;&s;aries to them&s;elves and families: they are their own hatters, &s;hoe-makers, taylors, tanners, weavers, carpenters, &s;miths, and joiners: they are even expert at &s;hip-building; and &s;ome of them make excellent violins. But their general turn is for carving in wood, which they execute in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner, with a com|mon knife of their own forging. They are taught in their youth to wre&s;tle, ride, &s;wim, &s;kate, climb, &s;hoot, and forge iron. Their amu&s;ements con&s;i&s;t in making ver&s;es, blowing the horn, or playing upon a kind of a guitarre, and the violin: this la&s;t kind of mu&s;ick they perform even at funerals. The Norwegians have evinced their valour and fidelity in a thou&s;and different in&s;tances. The country was always di&s;tracted by inte&s;tine quarrels, which raged from generation to generation. Even the farmers &s;tand upon their punctilio, and chal|lenge one another to &s;ingle combat with their knives. On &s;uch occa&s;ions they hook them&s;elves together by their belts, and fight until one of them is killed or mortally wounded. At weddings and public fea&s;ts they drink to intoxication, quarrel, fight, and murder generally en&s;ues. The very common people are likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ionate, ambitious of glory and independence, and vain of their pe|digree. The nobility and merchants of Norway
<PB N="106" REF="1150">
fare &s;umptuou&s;ly; but the pea&s;ant lives with the utmo&s;t temperance and frugality, except at fe&s;ti|vals: his common bread is made of oat-meal, rolled into broad thin cakes, like tho&s;e u&s;ed in Scotland. In time of &s;carcity they boil, dry, and grind the bark of the fir-tree into a kind of flour, which they mix with oat-meal: the bark of the elm-tree is u&s;ed in the &s;ame manner. In tho&s;e parts where a fi&s;hery is carried on, they knead the roes of cod with their oat-meal. Of the&s;e la&s;t, mixed with barley-meal, they make ha&s;ty-pudding, and &s;oup, enriched with a pickled herring or &s;alted mackarel. Fre&s;h fi&s;h they have in plenty on the &s;ea-coa&s;t. They hunt and eat grow&s;e, partridge, hare, red deer, and rein-deer. They kill cows, &s;heep, and goats for their winter &s;tock: the&s;e they pickle, or &s;moak, or dry for u&s;e. They make chee&s;e of their milk, and a liquor called &s;yre of their four whey: this they commonly drink mixed with water; but they provide a &s;tore of &s;trong ale for Chri&s;tmas, weddings, chri&s;tenings, and other entertainments. From their temperance and exer|ci&s;e, joined to the purity and ela&s;ticity of their air, they enjoy good health, and often attain to a &s;ur|pri&s;ing degree of longevity. Nothing is more common than to &s;ee a hearty Norwegian turned of an hundred. In the year 1733, four couples danced before his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty at Frederick&s;hall: their ages, when joined, exceeded eight hundred years. Neverthele&s;s, the Norwegians are &s;ubject to various di&s;ea&s;es; &s;uch as the &s;cab, the lepro&s;y, the &s;curvy, the catarrh, the rheumati&s;m, gout, and epilep&s;y. The dre&s;s of the Norway pea&s;ants con|&s;i&s;ts or a wide loo&s;e jacket, made of coar&s;e cloth, wai&s;tcoat and breeches of the &s;ame. Their heads are covered with flapped hats, or caps ornamented with ribbons. They wear &s;hoes without &s;oles, and in the winter leathern bu&s;kins. They have like-wi&s;e
<PB N="107" REF="1160">
&s;now-&s;hoes and long &s;kates, with which they travel at a great pace, either on the land or ice. There is a corps of &s;oldiers thus accoutred, who can out-march the &s;wifte&s;t hor&s;es. The Norwegian pea&s;ant never wears a neckcloth, except on extra|ordinary occa&s;ions: he opens his neck and brea&s;t to the weather, and lets the &s;now beat into his bo&s;om. His body is girt round with a broad leathern belt, adorned with bra&s;s plates, from which depends a bra&s;s chain that &s;u&s;tains a large knife, gimlet, and other tackle. The women are dre&s;&s;ed in clo&s;e laced jackets, having leathern girdles, decorated with ornaments of &s;ilver. They likewi&s;e wear &s;ilver chains round their necks, to the ends of which are fixed gilt medals. Their caps and handkerchiefs are almo&s;t covered with &s;mall plates of &s;ilver, bra&s;s, and tin, large rings and buttons. A maiden bride appears with her hair platted, and, together with her cloaths, hung full of &s;uch gingling trinkets.</P>
<P>The churches, public edifices, and many private hou&s;es in Norway, are built of &s;tone: but the people in general live in wooden hou&s;es, made of the trunks of fir and pine-tree laid upon each other, and joined by mortices at the corners. The&s;e are counted more dry, warm, and healthy than &s;tone or brick-buildings. In the whole dioce&s;e of Ber|gen, one hardly &s;ees a farm-hou&s;e with a chimney or windows: they are generally lighted by a &s;quare hole in the top of the hou&s;e, which lets in the light, and lets out the &s;moak. In &s;ummer this hole is left quite open: in the winter it is covered with what they call a &s;iau; that is, the membrane of &s;ome animal, &s;tretched upon a wooden frame that fits the hole, and tran&s;mits the rays of light. It is fixed or removed with a long pole, occa&s;ional|ly. Every per&s;on that enters the hou&s;e, upon bu&s;i|ne&s;s or court&s;hip, takes hold on this pole, accord|ing
<PB N="108" REF="1170">
to antient cu&s;tom. The ceiling is about eight feet high in the middle, and, being arched like a cupola, the &s;moke of the fire underneath rolls about, until it finds a vent at the hole, which is called liur. Under this opening &s;tands a thick table with benches, and an high &s;eat at the upper end for the ma&s;ter of the family: he has likewi&s;e a &s;mall cupboard for his own u&s;e, in which he locks up his mo&s;t valuable effects. The boards of the roof are coated with the bark of birch-trees, which is counted incorruptible: this again is covered with turf, which yields a good crop of gra&s;s for goats and &s;heep, and is often mowed as hay by the farmer.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The Norwegians carry on a con&s;iderable trade with foreign nations. The duty on the produce of their own country exported, amounts annually to one hundred thou&s;and rix-dollars. The&s;e commo|dities are, copper wrought and unwrought; iron, ca&s;t into cannon, &s;toves, and pots, or forged into bars; lead, in &s;mall quantity; ma&s;ts, timber, deal|boards, planks, marble, mill-&s;tones, herring, cod, ling, &s;almon, lob&s;ters, flounders, cow-hides, goat|&s;kins, &s;eal-&s;kins, the furs of bears, wolves, foxes, beavers, ermins, martens, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> down, feathers, butter, tallow, train-oil, tar, juniper, and other &s;orts of berries and nuts; &s;alt, allum, gla&s;s, vitriol, and pot-a&s;hes. All other commodities, and articles of luxury, the Norwegians import from different nations. The nature of the ground does not ad|mit of much improvement in agriculture: never|thele&s;s, the farmers are not deficient in indu&s;try and skill to drain mar&s;hes, and render the ground arable, or fit for pa&s;ture. Many are employed in grazing and breeding cattle: but a much greater number is engaged in felling wood, floating tim|ber,
<PB N="109" REF="1180">
burning charcoal, and extracting tar from the roots of the trees which have been cut down; in the &s;ilver, copper, and iron mines; in the naviga|tion and fi&s;hery. A con&s;iderable number of people earn a comfortable livelihood by hunting, &s;hooting, and bird-catching. Every individual is at liberty to pur&s;ue the game, e&s;pecially in the mountains and commons: therefore every pea&s;ant is expert in the u&s;e of fire-arms; and there are excellent mark&s;|men among the mountains, who make u&s;e of the bow to kill tho&s;e animals who&s;e skins, being valu|able, would be damaged by the &s;hot of fire-arms.</P>

<HEAD>Its SITUATION, EXTENT, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>OF the i&s;lands belonging to Norway, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable as well as the mo&s;t northerly, is Iceland, I&s;landia, &s;ituated in the Atlantic ocean be|tween Norway and Scotland, lying between 63 and 68 degrees of north latitude, and between 10 and 26 degrees of longitude we&s;t, from the meridian of London. It extends from ea&s;t to we&s;t about &s;even hundred and twenty miles: the breadth, at a me|dium, may be computed at three hundred. It is divided into four quarters, ea&s;t, we&s;t, north, and &s;outh; and the&s;e again are &s;ubdivided into eighteen &s;y&s;&s;els, or &s;hires, in which ju&s;tice is admini&s;tered by their re&s;pective &s;heriffs or judges.</P>

<HEAD>MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>The face of the country is mountainous, like that of Norway; but the coa&s;t is not crowded with i&s;lands and rocks: a few of the&s;e, however, appear to the &s;outhward; and there the &s;ea-fowl build in amazing numbers. They are very fertile, and bear excellent crops of gra&s;s, though not inhabited. Through the interior parts of Iceland runs a chain of huge mountains, both in length and acro&s;s the country; &s;ome of which are eternally covered with ice and &s;now: yet they are generally pa&s;&s;able to men and hor&s;es; and on the tops of &s;ome of them there are plains extending five and twenty miles. The mountains covered with ice and &s;now are called Jokeler, from which a great river continually flows of dark, muddy, &s;tinking water: the jokells are &s;udden interruptions of the road by large ponds or lakes of water frozen; which in a few days va|ni&s;h, &s;o as that the path re-appears. Several mountains in this country are volcanoes, &s;ubject, though &s;eldom, to violent eruptions. Of the&s;e, the mo&s;t remarkable are Krafle and Hecla; the fir&s;t &s;ituated in the north, and the other in the &s;outhern part of the i&s;land. Even the&s;e do not frequently emit fire, though they certainly have burned with great violence, di&s;charging va&s;t quantities of that melted matter which the Italians call Lava. Their &s;ides are &s;till covered with calcined &s;tones and a&s;hes. When the ice and &s;now are gathered around, and con&s;olidated to &s;uch a degree as to &s;top the holes through which the fire and vapour tran&s;pire, the earth begins to &s;hake, and fiery erup|tions commonly en&s;ue.

In the year 1726, a frightful rumbling noi&s;e was heard in the mountain Krafle: this was &s;oon fol|lowed by a dreadful eruption of fire and &s;moke, and a va&s;t di&s;charge of &s;tones and a&s;hes. It con|tinued burning, at intervals, till the year 1728, when the flames increa&s;ed &s;o as to melt the &s;ul|phureous matter in the mountain. This was di&s;|charged in a &s;tream that ran &s;lowly down the &s;ide of the hill, and continued its cour&s;e eighteen miles to a great lake, called My-vatne, in which it pro|duced a horrible hi&s;&s;ing and crackling. It ran till the year 1730, when it cea&s;ed of it&s;elf, after having in its cour&s;e overflowed and de&s;troyed a few hou&s;es and farms. The lake was in one place filled up with this lava, and the fi&s;h for &s;ome time di&s;ap|peared; but they afterwards returned, and at pre|&s;ent they &s;warm in this piece of water.</P>
<P>In the year 1721, &s;everal &s;hocks of an earth|quake were felt upon a mountain called Katlegan, on the &s;outhern part of the i&s;land, about &s;ix and thirty miles from the &s;ea, near Portland's Bay. Then a great quantity of fire was di&s;gorged, which melting the ice, gave ri&s;e to a dreadful torrent. This ru&s;hed down with &s;uch impetuo&s;ity, as to carry along with it &s;tones, &s;and, mould, and every thing in its way to the &s;ea, which it filled up with the&s;e materials to the di&s;tance of three miles from the &s;hore.</P>
<P>An eruption of the &s;ame kind, which had hap|pened many years before, produced &s;uch a violent agitation in the &s;ea, that the water ro&s;e to a prodi|gious height at the i&s;land of We&s;tman, which lies &s;eventy-two miles from the &s;hore of Iceland. The eruption of &s;moak, &s;and, and a&s;hes, eclip&s;ed the &s;un in &s;uch a manner, that he did not appear for a whole day; and the&s;e ruins were &s;trewed by the wind over the whole &s;urface of the i&s;land.</P>
<P><PB N="112" REF="1210">
Eruptions of the &s;ame &s;ort, though not quite &s;o terrible, have happened in different parts of the country. As to Hecla, it has not burned the&s;e &s;ixty years; and is now remarkable for nothing but its great height, and &s;everal cracks or cha&s;ms in its &s;ides and &s;ummits, filled with boiling water.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Iceland is well watered with large and &s;mall rivers, that flow from the moun|tains; be&s;ides rivulets, &s;treams, and large lakes, &s;ome of them thirty miles in circumference. All the&s;e abound with excellent fi&s;h. The country is defective in point of fore&s;ts; though there are &s;ome woods in the northern di&s;tricts, as well as in other parts of the i&s;land, and almo&s;t every farm has an adjoining nur&s;ery of young trees. Their want of fore&s;ts is in a great mea&s;ure compen&s;ated by large quantities of fine timber, that come float|ing a&s;hore in different parts of the &s;ea-coa&s;t. There is likewi&s;e plenty of &s;hrubs and bu&s;hes, which the inhabitants burn into charcoal for their forges.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The climate of Iceland is as temperate as that of Norway, and even purer than that of the &s;ea-coa&s;t in this kingdom, being oftener bru&s;hed and ventilated by high winds and &s;torms. The winter &s;ets in about the latter end of October, and the &s;pring appears in the middle of April. It &s;ome|times, however, &s;nows and hails in &s;ummer, but in &s;mall quantities: the weather in this &s;ea&s;on is ge|nerally warm, both by night and by day; for then the &s;un is but three hours below the horizon. At the northern extremity of the i&s;land the &s;un is &s;een, about the &s;ummer-&s;ol&s;tice, perpetually above the horizon. In the &s;horte&s;t day of winter the &s;un is &s;een no longer than one hour above the horizon;
<PB N="113" REF="1220">
yet the inhabitants, even there, enjoy three hours of day, be&s;ides twilight. In the &s;outhern parts, the &s;un is three hours above the horizon at the winter-&s;ol&s;tice, and the day is full &s;ix hours in length. The dawn and twilight continue much longer in Iceland than in Denmark, becau&s;e the circle, de&s;cribed by the &s;un under the horizon, is more oblique in this than in &s;outhern latitudes. The Aurora Borealis is frequent here, as in other northern climates, and the &s;ky is generally &s;erene. The &s;ea is never covered with ice, except that which comes floating from Greenland, extending &s;everal miles about the north coa&s;t, and exhibiting the re&s;emblance of another country, inter&s;per&s;ed with hill and dale; through which a good number of live animals, &s;uch as bears, foxes, and faulcons, may be &s;een running, clambering, and flying.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>The greater part of the mountains in Iceland are covered with excellent gra&s;s, and the interme|diate valleys are extremely fruitful in herbage. The interior parts of the i&s;land are not inhabited; but in the&s;e the natives graze their cattle, which are tended by per&s;ons employed for that purpo&s;e, who build &s;ummer-huts for their own convenience. The ground, naturally fruitful, is enriched by the &s;oil wa&s;hed from the mountains. In different places, mould, clay, and &s;and predominate. The mar&s;hes, when drained, yield good pa&s;ture; and turf is to be found in almo&s;t every part of the i&s;land.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>WATER.</HEAD>
<P>The water of Iceland is generally light, pure, and free from mineral impregnation; not but that, in &s;ome places, we meet with chalybeate &s;prings: but the mo&s;t remarkable circum&s;tance of the Ice|land water is, that in a great many parts of the
<PB N="114" REF="1230">
&s;land there are hot &s;prings, of various degrees of warmth. On the north &s;hore, and in the pari&s;h of Hun&s;evig, about fifty miles from the mountain Krafle, are three hot &s;prings, at the di&s;tance of thirty fathoms from each other. In the&s;e the water boils up and &s;inks alternately, in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner. One of the&s;e wells empties it&s;elf, by a &s;mall aper|ture, into a natural &s;tone ba&s;on, as large as a brew|ing copper. Here the water ri&s;es at three different ebullitions: at the third it &s;urmounts the brim of the ba&s;on about twelve feet; then &s;inks down four feet within the re&s;ervoir; and immediately another ebullition en&s;ues. The water being poured into bottles, will continue for &s;ome time to ri&s;e and fall in the&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ebullitions, keeping time with that which remains in the fountain or re&s;ervoir: if the bottles be corked up as &s;oon as filled, whenever the water ri&s;es in the well, they will bur&s;t in pieces. A &s;tone, or even a piece of wood, thrown into the well, while the water is &s;ub&s;iding, will be carried down to the bottom, and ca&s;t up again with great force when the water boils over. When cold, it is very plea&s;ant to the ta&s;te, and may be drank with &s;afety. The cows of a neighbouring farm drink it as it runs from the ci&s;tern, while it is blood|warm, and yield an extraordinary quantity of milk. The inhabitants, who live near tho&s;e hot baths, employ them for &s;everal u&s;es: they boil their meat, by &s;inking their pots, covered, to a certain depth in the ci&s;tern: they boil their tea-kettles in the &s;ame manner; bend hoops for barrels, by dipping them in the hot water; and make u&s;e of it for bathing, a practice that conduces to their health and longevity. The &s;ea-water on the coa&s;t of Ice|land is more impregnated with &s;alt, than are mo&s;t parts of the northern ocean, and, for this rea&s;on, le&s;s liable to be frozen.</P>

<HEAD>PRODUCTIONS: VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<P>Iceland produces rich crops of gra&s;s, upon the mountains as well as in the valleys and meadows; and part of this the farmers mow down for their winter &s;upply. The herbs and roots common in other northern countries, are found here in abun|dance; particularly the cochlearia, or &s;curvy-gra&s;s, the aceto&s;a, or &s;orrel, and the angelica, which la&s;t is eaten by the Icelanders: but one of their mo&s;t delicate di&s;hes is made of the mu&s;cus catharticus i&s;landiae, or mountain-gra&s;s, that grows on the rocks in great abundance, and is both whol&s;ome and palatable. Many of the natives, who are &s;tocked with this herb, make no provi&s;ion of flour or meal. All kitchen-herbs and roots are ea&s;ily brought to maturity in Iceland, which is not colder than Denmark; and this is likewi&s;e the ca&s;e with the common fruit-trees, which thrive exceedingly well in the gardens belonging to the king's hou&s;es, the bi&s;hops, ju&s;tices, and other per&s;ons of note in the i&s;land. The country would certainly produce corn, and all &s;orts of grain; and formerly it has been cultivated for that purpo&s;e: but at pre&s;ent this branch of hu&s;bandry is di&s;u&s;ed, though his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty has lately &s;ent thither &s;ome expert farmers from Norway to introduce tillage, and in|&s;truct the Icelanders to manure and cultivate their lands. The &s;ea of Iceland yields a vegetable called the alga marina &s;accharifera, but by the natives &s;ol. The cattle and &s;heep are &s;o fond of this weed, that they are often lo&s;t by going too far from the &s;hore in que&s;t of it, at low water. The inhabitants, finding it nouri&s;hing and tooth&s;ome, gather it for their own eating, and &s;ell it for half the price of fi&s;h to tho&s;e who live in the more interior parts of the i&s;land. The &s;ea likewi&s;e produces other ve|getables;
<PB N="116" REF="1250">
and &s;ome pieces of coral are dragged up on the hooks and in the nets of fi&s;hermen.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>STONES, METALS, and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>There are &s;tones of various colours found in Iceland; but to marble. It likewi&s;e produces a kind of chry&s;tal, a large quantity of pumice-&s;tones, and near the volcanoes, two &s;orts of agate: one of the&s;e will burn like a candle, and is undoubtedly a &s;pecies of bitumen: the other is tran&s;parent, and &s;eems to be a kind of vitrification. It is found in great quantities at the mountain Krafle, &s;ome pieces weighing each an hundred pounds. Iceland is certainly rich in minerals, though there are no mines worked in the country. The people find, even above ground, large lumps of &s;ilver, copper, and iron ore, &s;o rich, that they are melted by a common wood-fire, and the metal made into various uten&s;ils. But the principal mineral of this i&s;land is &s;ulphur, di&s;covered by a &s;trong &s;ubterra|neous heat that &s;mokes through the ground, in the rocks, mountains, and plains. It is generally found in the neighbourhood of hot &s;prings, co|vered with a layer of &s;and and clay, white, yel|low, blue, or green. This being removed, the &s;ulphur is taken up with &s;hovels, in &s;uch abun|dance, that in one hour four&s;core hor&s;es may be loaded. The be&s;t veins are rai&s;ed in banks; and, when uncovered, appear like candied &s;ugar, in intire hard lumps, not ea&s;ily broken; but at a little di&s;tance from the middle it may be &s;hovelled up in du&s;t. The labourers are obliged to tie woollen rags about their &s;hoes, to prevent them from burn|ing; nor can they bear the work in hot weather. The &s;ulphur, when fir&s;t taken up, is &s;o hot, that it can hardly be handled. In two or three years the veins, which have been exhau&s;ted, will be again
<PB N="117" REF="1260">
filled with &s;ulphur: &s;o quick is the vegetation or regeneration of this mineral. Great quantities of &s;ulphur have been exported from hence to Copen|hagen, and other countries; but at pre&s;ent that branch of trade has entirely cea&s;ed. There is no manufacture of &s;alt in Iceland, though the coun|try is &s;aid to afford &s;aline &s;prings as well as &s;al petre.</P>

<HEAD>ANIMALS: QUADRUPEDS.</HEAD>
<P>The bear is not a native of Iceland, but &s;ome|times imported thither on floats of ice from Green|land. The people are very vigilant in watching for the&s;e gue&s;ts; whom they no &s;ooner di&s;cover, either in coming a&s;hore, or by the marks of their paws on the &s;now, than they forthwith pur&s;ue and attack them boldly, &s;ome with guns, and others with &s;pears. There was an old Icelander in the northern di&s;trict, who had &s;lain a great number of bears with his &s;ingle arm: he always u&s;ed a &s;pear, and charged the bea&s;t in front. The Greenland bear is extremely fierce and large; and his natural ferocity is generally increa&s;ed by the pangs of hun|ger, which he has &s;u&s;tained in his voyage from that country. His fur is counted better than that of any other bear, being &s;ometimes white as &s;now. Should he &s;uddenly attack a native, who is unpre|pared for defence, the Icelander throws &s;omething at him for his amu&s;ement. When a glove is &s;acri|ficed for this purpo&s;e, the bear will not &s;tir until he has turned every finger in&s;ide out. Iceland is productive of a great number of foxes; but the black fox is a &s;tranger from Greenland, and very &s;carce in this country. The&s;e animals, however, appear in different colours; &s;uch as red, white, and grey: and the inhabitants are at great pains to de&s;troy them, not only on account of their &s;kins, but al&s;o in defence of their flocks. They are ge|nerally
<PB N="118" REF="1270">
allured by the &s;tinking carca&s;e of a hor&s;e; and while they prey upon it in great numbers, the people &s;hoot them with fowling-pieces. The Ice|land hor&s;es are of the Norwegian or Scotti&s;h breed, well-&s;haped, hardy, mettle&s;ome, though very do|cile, and of different &s;izes. Great numbers run wild in the mountains: tho&s;e that are trained to labour have no &s;helter or provender, even in the winter; during which they &s;crape away the &s;now and ice with their hoofs, until they dig to the earth for nouri&s;hment. As for the &s;addle-hor&s;es, they are hou&s;ed and fed in the &s;evere weather. The &s;heep of this country are of the &s;ame &s;ize and nature with tho&s;e of Norway, Denmark, and Swe|den. In mo&s;t parts of Iceland the &s;heep, mares, and cows are hou&s;ed in the winter: for this pur|po&s;e every farmer is provided with folds and &s;tables. Some flocks, however, range about in all weathers, and take &s;helter occa&s;ionally in caves in the moun|tains. Here, as in all other mountainous and cold countries, they are apt to be buried in wreaths of &s;now, and hurried into the &s;ea by &s;udden tor|rents. They are provided with an extraordinary coat of long hair, which covers the fleece, and is &s;pun into coar&s;e thread. The wool they &s;hed yearly towards the beginning of the &s;ummer. The farmers, perceiving the coat ready to drop, pull it clean away, and, turning the &s;heep adri&s;t, they are provided with a new fleece before the re|turn of the cold weather. In the northern di&s;trict the goats are much more numerous than the &s;heep, and thrive remarkably on the heath and bu&s;hes.</P>
<P>The cows and oxen of Iceland re&s;emble tho&s;e of Norway, from whence the breed was imported. The inhabitants make con&s;iderable quantities of chee&s;e and butter; though this la&s;t is never &s;alted, therefore proves rancid, and offen&s;ive to the &s;en&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="1280">
of &s;melling. Of the whey they make &s;yre, which they keep and drink like the Norwegians. Such is their aver&s;ion to &s;alt, that when they &s;laughter bea&s;ts for winter provi&s;ion, in&s;tead of pickling, they dry the meat in the &s;moke to pre&s;erve it from putrefaction. Hogs are very &s;carce in Iceland. Of dogs, cats, and mice, there is great plenty.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>Iceland is not deficient in poultry and pigeons; though the inhabitants do not breed them in great numbers, partly on account of the &s;carcity of grain, and partly becau&s;e their wild fowl produce a greater quantity of eggs than the natives can con&s;ume. Among the wild land-fowl of Iceland, we number partridges, &s;nipes, owzels, and becca|&s;ines. The land-birds of prey are eagles, faulcons, &s;mall hawks, and ravens. The faulcons of Iceland are &s;o excellent for &s;port, that his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty &s;ends thither a per&s;on every year, to buy up, at a con&s;iderable price, tho&s;e that the natives have caught in nets and &s;nares made for that purpo&s;e. No crows, magpies, or owls, are ever &s;een in Ice|land. The cliffs, rocks, and &s;mall i&s;lands about the coa&s;t are covered with &s;ea-birds, that come hither to breed, and prey upon the innumerable myriads of fi&s;h that &s;warm through the northern ocean. Swans and wild ducks frequent the fre&s;h|water lakes and rivers in the &s;ummer, and there they breed in the &s;pring; but when the&s;e are frozen they re&s;ort to the &s;ea, which is always open. The &s;wan-eggs are eaten as delicacies; but the bird is hunted for his down and feathers, which are &s;old to great advantage. Wild gee&s;e are here birds of pa&s;&s;age: they arrive in the &s;pring, hatch their young, and depart about the latter end of autumn: of the&s;e there are five different &s;pecies;
<PB N="120" REF="1290">
but we reckon ten different kinds of wild ducks, five of which are fit to be eaten, and well-flavoured. Of the&s;e the down-bird is the mo&s;t e&s;teemed and cheri&s;hed. The duck is of the common &s;ize, and a dark-brown colour, except on the brea&s;t, which is of a lighter hue: the drake is as large as a goo&s;e, and has a great number of white feathers. They delight to build in little lonely i&s;lands: but the people have inticed them to the main land by tender u&s;age, and &s;creening them from all di&s;|turbance. Thus treated, they will &s;it upon their eggs when vi&s;ited, and even &s;uffer them to be taken away, once or twice in a &s;ea&s;on. The duck will continue to lay others, until &s;he is allowed to hatch a brood: in that ca&s;e they will return next year, and multiply on the &s;ame &s;pot. In making their ne&s;ts, the&s;e birds pluck the down from their own brea&s;ts, that on this bed their eggs may lie &s;oft and warm. The duck lays four large green eggs, which are delicious to the palate: the&s;e the natives take away, together with the down, and de&s;troy the ne&s;t. The duck goes to work again in the &s;ame manner, and is robbed the &s;econd time. She renews her labour; but her brea&s;t being by this time bare, the drake &s;upplies the ne&s;t with down, which, as it is white, is the more valuable. If the duck is three times deprived of her eggs, &s;he quits that part of the country, and looks out for a new habitation: for that rea&s;on a prudent farmer will allow her to hatch her la&s;t produce; and he may be certain &s;he and her young will re|turn next &s;ea&s;on, when he will have three ne&s;ts in&s;tead of one. When the young quit the ne&s;t, the people gather the down; &s;o that every pair yields eight eggs, and three parcels of down, in one &s;ea&s;on: this down they export, and &s;ell to great advantage. The plongeon and northern
<PB N="121" REF="1300">
diver we have de&s;cribed in our account of Norway. The geirs, or vultures, build in great numbers among cliffs and rocks in the &s;ea, from whence the natives bring their eggs in boat-loads. This is likewi&s;e the ca&s;e with a va&s;t variety of other &s;hore-birds, that dwell among the &s;teep rocks. Here their ne&s;ts are robbed, and them&s;elves taken, by the &s;ame methods we have de&s;cribed as practi&s;ed in Norway. The eggs of the&s;e &s;ea and &s;hore birds are generally &s;potted, of a greeni&s;h colour, with a very thick &s;hell; thus contrived by Providence, that it may the longer retain the heat of incubation, as the bird is obliged to roam, in que&s;t of food, at a great di&s;tance from its habitation. Though the&s;e birds build in &s;warms innumerable clo&s;e to each other, in the cliffs and cavities of the rocks; yet, after they have been di&s;turbed, and incredible flights are &s;een to hover on the wing, each individual at once di&s;tingui&s;hes and re&s;umes its own ne&s;t, by a never-erring in&s;tinct.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FISHES.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;ea of Iceland abounds with infinite mul|titudes of the &s;ame kinds of fi&s;hes which we have numbered in our de&s;cription of Norway; and the fi&s;hery is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable branch of com|merce in which the people of this country are em|ployed. Herrings are driven in va&s;t &s;hoals by the whales, and other fi&s;hes of prey, into the creeks and harbours of Iceland, during their annual pro|gre&s;&s;ion from the North Pole; but the Icelanders neither know how to cure this fi&s;h, nor have they &s;alt &s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e: be&s;ides, the large fat herrings, proper for pickling, &s;eldom come in great numbers to this coa&s;t, except when they are chaced by accident. At all other times, indeed, va&s;t multitudes of pilchards and &s;prats arrive with the cod, and are preyed upon by this fi&s;h, by the
<PB N="122" REF="1310">
whale, and other mon&s;ters of the deep, as well as by the fowls of heaven, that hover over them in amazing numbers, and dart upon them with in|credible velocity. But the inhabitants of Iceland apply them&s;elves chiefly to the cod-fi&s;hery; though this is in a great mea&s;ure confined to the &s;outh and we&s;tern quarters of the i&s;land. This branch of traffick they are the more encouraged to pur&s;ue, as they can catch and cure the cod, without any con&s;iderable expence but that of labour.</P>
<P>Towards the &s;pring of the year the cod fir&s;t ap|pears to the ea&s;tward of the i&s;land, then to the &s;outhward, and afterwards about the great creek or bay between Reckene&s;s and We&s;ter-jokel, which is twenty leagues broad, and runs up &s;ixteen miles into the country. Here the greate&s;t fi&s;heries are e&s;tabli&s;hed, and to this place the natives come to fi&s;h from all quarters of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>The fi&s;h is caught on hooks, baited with mu&s;|cles, and fixed to long lines like tho&s;e of Norway. The &s;ea&s;on begins in May, and continues till the end of autumn. The be&s;t fi&s;h are caught in deep water; therefore the fi&s;hermen are obliged to put out &s;ometimes eight leagues to &s;ea, where they often remain eight and forty hours in their open boats, almo&s;t without &s;u&s;tenance. When the cod are brought on &s;hore, the fi&s;herman goes to work on the &s;pot; heads, guts, &s;lits them open, extracts the greater part of the back-bone, then folds them together, and next day &s;preads them out to dry, if the weather be fair: but, if the day be cloudy or wet, they lay the fi&s;h one over another, with the &s;kin upwards: in this po&s;ture, however, they mu&s;t not lie above four and twenty hours, otherwi&s;e they would be apt to putrefy. If the damp weather continues, or a fro&s;t intervenes, the fi&s;h are laid in little heaps, the &s;le&s;hy parts applied to each other, and the &s;kins externally; and thus they
<PB N="123" REF="1320">
lie until the weather is fit for drying: then they &s;pread them out &s;ingly upon &s;tones along the &s;hore; and the women turn them &s;everal times a-day, that on every &s;ide they may imbibe equal portions of the &s;un and air. If the weather holds good, they are thoroughly dried in fourteen days. What is intended for home-con&s;umption, the people carry home to their re&s;pective hou&s;es: tho&s;e that are de|&s;igned for export, they pile up in &s;eparate &s;tacks as high as hou&s;es. The&s;e are bought by the mer|chants, who cover them from the rain, until they can be conveniently &s;towed on board of their &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els. The Dani&s;h merchants in Iceland pickle &s;everal hundred ca&s;ks of cod yearly, and ex|port them to Copenhagen; but this way of curing is little practi&s;ed by the natives. The Danes like|wi&s;e cure a con&s;iderable quantity in another man|ner, which gives the denomination of clip-fi&s;h; whereas the other is called flat-fi&s;h. In order to make clip-fi&s;h, the cod mu&s;t lie three days in pickle, then be wa&s;hed in the &s;ea-water, pickled again, laid out to dry like the flat-fi&s;h, made up in heaps, towards the evening pre&s;&s;ed with heavy &s;tones, and covered from the weather. The ling is a long narrow &s;pecies of cod, dre&s;&s;ed and cured as the others, though more e&s;teemed. The ti&s;ling, or titling, is a &s;mall cod, and perhaps the young of that &s;pecies; which the Icelanders find in great plenty, and cure in the u&s;ual manner for exporta|tion. The cole-fi&s;h, which the Icelanders call ypre, belongs likewi&s;e to the &s;ame family, being almo&s;t as large as the cod, though not equal to it in flavour.</P>
<P>The Iceland fi&s;hermen dry the heads of their cod, and &s;ell them for a good price in the country. The bones are u&s;ed for firing, where there is a &s;carcity of fuel; and they are likewi&s;e given as food to the cattle, after having been &s;oftened in
<PB N="124" REF="1330">
boiling water. The livers are re&s;erved in a ve&s;&s;el, and, being boiled together, yield a con&s;iderable proportion of train-oil.</P>
<P>In the we&s;tern parts of Iceland the fi&s;h are &s;lit open by the back; and, a pole being thru&s;t through them, they are hung up to dry in hou&s;es made of lath, and &s;o open, that there is a thorough circulation of air from one end to the other. This is the way of curing hang-fi&s;h, which the people re&s;erve for dome&s;tic u&s;e, when the fi&s;hing &s;ea&s;on is over: while that continues, they regale them&s;elves with the be&s;t of the fre&s;h fi&s;h which is taken. The &s;hores of Iceland abound with haddock, which is by the natives e&s;teemed equal to cod, and cured in the manner of clip-fi&s;h. The Iceland whiting excels in &s;ize, fatne&s;s, and flavour. The flounders of Iceland, being fat, large, and numerous, are taken and dried for winter provi&s;ion. Plenty of large turbot, &s;ix feet in length, and broad in pro|portion, are caught by the&s;e people, who cut them in long &s;lices, dry, and afterwards cook them into a delicate me&s;s, which they call reklengur. The lupus marinus is here caught in great numbers, and much e&s;teemed; as is another fi&s;h nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize and figure, which the Icelanders de|nominate klir. Here is a delicious fi&s;h called the r&auml;d-mave, or red belly, generally found in &s;hallow water: it is caught in great abundance with nets, hooks, and &s;pears. Of the &s;ame form and &s;hape is the graae-maven, or grey belly, though &s;ome|what larger: it is thought to be the female of the r&auml;d-mave: they are delicate when eaten fre&s;h, and much e&s;teemed when &s;alted, dried, and &s;moaked. The thorn-back, or &s;kate, is here counted excel|lent, and cured in the manner of clip-fi&s;h. There is another &s;mall fi&s;h, analagous to the perch, which is caught in Iceland, under the denomination of kerve.</P>

Among the whales, that &s;port in great numbers on the Iceland coa&s;t, we find the great Greenland whale, with a &s;mooth back, &s;ometimes two hun|dred and forty feet in length. In the belly of a Greenland whale, which ran him&s;elf aground, and was killed, the Icelanders found &s;ix hundred fine live cod, together with a great quantity of herrings, and &s;ome birds. The people of this country are not very expert at whale-fi&s;hing. They approach him in a boat, and &s;triking him with an iron har|poon, &s;tamped with the owner's mark, row away with the utmo&s;t expedition. If the fi&s;h be pro|perly &s;truck, he will die, and float to &s;ome part of the coa&s;t, unle&s;s the wind &s;ets from &s;hore; in which ca&s;e he is carried out to &s;ea, and lo&s;t. When he is found dead upon the beach, a certain &s;hare is, by the laws of Iceland, the property of him who owns the harpoon: the re&s;t belongs to the pro|prietor of the land. The fins and blubber are &s;old to the Dani&s;h merchants: the boiled fle&s;h, left in the pot, they macerate in &s;yre, which is as &s;our as vinegar, and then it becomes very good eating. The fle&s;h of tho&s;e whales that have teeth is, how|ever, rejected as improper food. The &s;pring whale, about eighteen feet long, delights in pur&s;uing boats, and will jump &s;urpri&s;ingly out of the water, in order to overwhelm them; but their eyelids fall down &s;o as to blind them, as &s;oon as they leap above the &s;urface. The Icelanders catch plenty of porcpi&s;ces eight feet long, which &s;wim very &s;lowly, are ea&s;ily frightened, and killed wth harpoons: their fle&s;h is eaten by the natives. The &s;ea-calf, or white &s;hark, which the Icelanders call haakal, is &s;ometimes found eighteen feet long, with a liver that will yield &s;ixty gallons of oil: they are caught in great numbers by means of a machine, fur|ni&s;hed with large baited hooks, &s;ecured by iron chains, and fa&s;tened to a buoy that floats upon the
<PB N="126" REF="1350">
&s;urface. The fle&s;h is accounted good eating; but never u&s;ed until it has been hung up for a twelve|month: then it ta&s;tes like &s;moaked &s;almon. Here is the &s;word or &s;aw-fi&s;h; and a great number of &s;eals, di&s;tingui&s;hed into the different cla&s;&s;es of the land-&s;eal, the i&s;land-&s;eal, and the Greenland-&s;eal. The fir&s;t is the &s;malle&s;t, and harbours among the rocks on different parts of the coa&s;t, at the mouths of creeks and rivers. The other two &s;pecies are from four to ten feet in length. The i&s;land-&s;eals are &s;o called becau&s;e they re&s;ide upon de&s;olate i&s;lands round the coa&s;t. The &s;eals from Green|land arrive annually at the northern parts of the country in the month of December, and tarry till May. They are caught in a kind of labyrinth formed by large nets, in which they &s;ometimes find two hundred at one draught. Tho&s;e that ba&s;k them&s;elves on the uninhabited i&s;lands are knocked down with clubs; and the land-&s;eals are generally &s;hot from a rifled barrel. All the&s;e ani|mals yield a great proportion of train-oil, and their &s;kins are &s;old at a good price. The fre&s;h-water fi&s;h of Iceland are trout, &s;almon, and eels, which are taken in great quantities in lakes and rivers that communicate with the &s;ea. The &s;almon &s;wims again&s;t the &s;tream; and when he arrives at a water|fall, will jump to an incredible height, with a view to &s;urmount this ob&s;truction. Of delicate trout there is &s;uch abundance in &s;ome parts of Iceland, that the natives make them into flat-fi&s;h, and live upon them during the winter.</P>

<P>No &s;nakes are ever &s;een in Iceland; nor is any country on the globe le&s;s troubled with in&s;ects and vermin. Flies and gnats, indeed, are trouble&s;ome in the &s;ummer: and a &s;ort of worm appears in wet

<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE.</HEAD>
<P>Iceland is &s;o far from being populous, that the whole number of inhabitants does not exceed four|&s;core thou&s;and. In the fourteenth century the i&s;land was almo&s;t depopulated by a pe&s;tilential di&s;|temper, called &s;orte-dod, which extended it&s;elf to Norway, Sweden, and Denmark. The people of Iceland likewi&s;e &s;uffered grievou&s;ly by the &s;mall|pox, and other calamities, in&s;omuch that not one tenth part of the i&s;land is now inhabited. The natives, for the mo&s;t part, live along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, though there are &s;ome families likewi&s;e &s;ettled above one hundred miles up in the country. There are two and twenty harbours in Iceland; and at each of the&s;e is built a factory, or little town, where the company of merchants trade with the inhabitants. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are many &s;mall villages, con&s;i&s;ting of forty or fifty hou&s;es, huts, and cottages: but the i&s;land is divided into pari&s;hes, and, in general, every family lives apart from its neighbour, in a detached farm.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Their LANGUAGE and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Icelanders, who were originally a colony from Norway, &s;till &s;peak the old Norwegian dia|lect, though they have adopted a great number of words and terms from the Scots, with whom they heretofore maintained a con&s;iderable traffick. The Lutheran doctrine is the only religion here tole|rated. The country is divided into two bi&s;hop|ricks; namely, the &s;ee of Skalholt for the &s;outh, and that of Hoolum for the north. Each of the&s;e is provided with a Latin &s;chool, governed by a rector, and other a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who teach the lan|guages,
<PB N="128" REF="1370">
theology, and other branches of litera|ture, &s;o as to qualify youth for the mini&s;try, and that they may be ordained prie&s;ts in the i&s;land: many, however, pro&s;ecute their &s;tudies at the uni|ver&s;ity of Copenhagen. The revenue of each bi&s;hop amounts to about two thou&s;and rixdollars; from which, however, he mu&s;t maintain the rector and corrector, the mini&s;ter of the cathedral church, and a certain number of &s;cholars. At the time of the reformation great part of the church revenues was &s;ecularized, and now belong to the king. The livings are generally moderate, and &s;ome of them very poor. The clergy here have no tythes; but &s;ome &s;mall dues are payed to them, either in merchandize or money. Some of the&s;e mini&s;ters are &s;o needy, that they are obliged to earn a hard &s;ub&s;i&s;tence by fi&s;hing, or other manual labour: they are generally per&s;ons of good morals, and po&s;|&s;e&s;s a tolerable &s;hare of &s;chool learning. The churches are generally low, and but indifferently decorated: neverthele&s;s they are clean, decent, and commodious. For the mo&s;t part they belong to individuals, who make no &s;cruple of &s;towing their che&s;ts of merchandize in the loft over the place of wor&s;hip, which is always neatly wain&s;cotted, and furni&s;hed with pulpit, altar, de&s;k, and pews.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>GOVERNMENT and LAWS.</HEAD>
<P>The Icelanders are ruled by a governor called Staffts-amptmand, or rather by his deputy the Amptmand: the former is generally cho&s;en by the king from the Dani&s;h nobility, and re&s;ides at Co|penhagen; but the amptmand always lives in Ice|land at the king's palace of Re&s;&s;e&s;ted, on a &s;alary of four hundred rixdollars. His maje&s;ty likewi&s;e appoints a receiver, who collects all the taxes and revenues, and tran&s;mits them to the trea&s;ury. Be|&s;ides the &s;teward there are &s;u&s;&s;elmen, who farm
<PB N="129" REF="1380">
the king's taxes in certain di&s;tricts, and act as ju&s;|tices of the peace, each within his own province. The king's revenues in Iceland ari&s;e from taxes and dues, an annual &s;um payed by the company of merchants, &s;ecularized abbey-lands, and other royal deme&s;nes farmed out to the natives.</P>
<P>Law-&s;uits concerning freehold property, are de|termined by the Norwegian law: but in every di&s;|pute relating to <HI>meum</HI> and <HI>tuum,</HI> the old Iceland law takes place. The old eccle&s;ia&s;tical law is aboli&s;hed; and ca&s;es of tythes, or other &s;piritual matters, are decided by the law of Norway, or by royal edicts: the&s;e likewi&s;e obtain in criminal proce&s;&s;es. There are two judges, called langmaend, that pre&s;ide over the &s;outhern and northern divi&s;ions, and &s;ome|times deputies are allowed. Actions are fir&s;t brought in the court of the Sy&s;&s;elman, from whence they may be evoked to the Langret, or general court, held at Oxeraae, under one of the judges: from this again an appeal may be lodged at the high court, in which the deputy-governor pre&s;ides, with the other judge, and eleven &s;y&s;&s;el|men as his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. If the cau&s;e be of great con|&s;equence, the la&s;t re&s;ource is the &s;upreme court at Copenhagen. In &s;piritual ca&s;es the deputy gover|nor &s;its as judge, with the deans and clergy as his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. In Iceland there is no other legal way of puni&s;hing men with death than beheading with an ax, and hanging: the women, condemned to die, are &s;ewed in a &s;ack and drowned.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHARACTER, MANNERS, and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>The Icelanders are generally &s;ober, hone&s;t, do|cile, and indu&s;trious. They amu&s;e them&s;elves with cards and che&s;s: they &s;ing rude &s;ongs, re|citing the exploits of their ance&s;tors, and dance in a ru&s;tic manner to the &s;ound of a fiddle, at their fe&s;tivals. They are, like all other people who
<PB N="130" REF="1390">
dwell in cold countries, fond of drinking &s;pirituous liquors, though few are in a condition to purcha&s;e any con&s;iderable quantity: but the mo&s;t di&s;agree|able part of their character is their litigious di&s;po|&s;ition, which they inherit from their Norwegian forefathers. The people of this country are well|formed by nature, and endowed with a con&s;ider|able &s;hare of bodily &s;trength; though they &s;eldom attain to a very old age. While children, they are tenderly nur&s;ed at home; but, as &s;oon as they are &s;trong enough to row a boat, they engage in the fi&s;hery. This is a life of toil and hard&s;hip, to which they quickly become inured. In the exer|ci&s;e of this profe&s;&s;ion they are &s;o hardy, and care|le&s;s of health, that they frequently leap into the &s;ea, in order to &s;ave their boats from the rocks, and never dream of &s;hifting their wet clothes, even in fro&s;ty weather. The&s;e practices, however, have an evident effect upon their con&s;titutions. About the age of fifty they begin to decay, and are &s;ub|ject to various di&s;tempers. The rheumati&s;m, fe|vers, a&s;thma, and con&s;umption are incident to the Icelanders: but the lepro&s;y, or rather a kind of hereditary &s;curvy, is the prevailing di&s;ea&s;e. Nor are they exempted from cholicks, hypochondriacy, and other di&s;orders; and their women are very &s;ubject to hard and dangerous labours. The&s;e calamities are the more felt, as there is neither phy&s;ician nor &s;urgeon on the i&s;land. When the natives are &s;eized with any di&s;temper, they ab&s;tain from the u&s;e of tobacco and &s;pirituous liquors, drink large quantities of boiled whey, and leave the cure to Nature. The women are rather deli|cate than healthy: except at the &s;ea&s;on of hay|making, they are u&s;ed to a &s;edentary life, in clean|ing and combing wool, &s;pinning or knitting gloves or &s;tockings, and in weaving coar&s;e cloth, of which they make &s;hoes and apparel. The chil|dren
<PB N="131" REF="1400">
are mo&s;tly bred up by hand, fed with cows milk, which they &s;uck through a horn, rocked in cradles, dre&s;&s;ed up in &s;waddling cloaths, and nur&s;ed with a degree of tenderne&s;s not at all conform|able to the hard, toil&s;ome, penurious lives they are doomed to lead.</P>
<P>The Icelanders con&s;ume great quantities of fre&s;h fi&s;h, and mutton, which is generally overboiled. They u&s;e a great deal of butter in their &s;auce, as well as milk in their common diet. In the &s;our whey, called &s;yre, they pickle &s;heeps-heads, after the &s;kin has been well &s;inged and &s;craped; and the&s;e they fry occa&s;ionally. Every creditable farmer kills at the rate of twenty &s;heep for his winter pro|vi&s;ion, be&s;ides the fi&s;h which he cures for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. As no corn is rai&s;ed in Iceland, the common people &s;eldom eat bread, except at fea&s;ts and fe&s;tivals. Yet there is &s;ome wild corn that grows in the di&s;trict of Skaftefield, of which the natives make good flour and bread, equally nou|ri&s;hing and agreeable to the palate. This kind of corn &s;hoots up in deep &s;and, two feet and a half in height, with long ears, re&s;embling the wheat of Denmark. The people being ill provided with mills, dry it before the fire, until it is &s;corched, that it may be the more ea&s;ily brayed; therefore the bread is blacker than that which is made of rye in Denmark. In lieu of bread, the Icelanders u&s;e dried fi&s;h, well beaten, and eaten unboiled with butter &s;pread upon it: dried trout and whiting are very delicious when dre&s;&s;ed in this manner. The common drink of the Icelanders is water alone, or water mixed with &s;yre. The better &s;ort import malt and hops, with which they brew their own beer; and at the factories they purcha&s;e French wine and brandy: but the&s;e are u&s;ed very &s;paring|ly. The vulgar cannot afford to buy them in any quantity, all their merchandize being barely
<PB N="132" REF="1410">
&s;ufficient to purcha&s;e meal, timber, fi&s;hing-lines, and hooks, iron, cloth, and other indi&s;pen&s;ible nece&s;&s;aries.</P>
<P>The Iceland women are commonly clad in pet|ticoats, and aprons of coloured Dani&s;h cloth. The better &s;ort of both &s;exes wear cloth jackets: the men have wide breeches, or trow&s;ers, in the Dani&s;h fa&s;hion, and great coats, which they wear in win|ter. The women likewi&s;e u&s;e an upper garment of black cloth, with narrow &s;leeves that reach down to the wri&s;t, which, in common with the man's great coat, is called <HI>hempe:</HI> &s;ometimes the&s;e robes are faced with black velvet, and adorned with &s;ilver or gilt cla&s;ps and buttons. Their coloured petti|coats and aprons are bordered with velvet, or co|loured &s;ilk ribbands; and three great worked &s;ilver or bra&s;s buttons are fixed before. Their jackets are laced down the &s;eams in the &s;ame manner, and the &s;leeve is &s;ecured near the wri&s;t with two or three &s;ilver or bra&s;s buttons. Their head-dre&s;s is compo&s;ed of three handkerchiefs, formed like a tuft on the top of the head, a foot and a half high, and a fourth handkerchief of &s;ilk or cotton is pinned round their necks. A bride on her wedding|day wears a crown of &s;ilver under the white linnen tuft, together with three &s;ilver chains, one of which hangs down behind, and the other two dangle on her brea&s;t: to one of the&s;e is fixed a box of per|fumes, with &s;everal partitions, and open on both &s;ides. An Iceland lady &s;hall &s;ometimes po&s;&s;e&s;s trinkets to the value of four hundred rixdollars. The women of this country make their own &s;hoes of ox-hide or &s;heeps-&s;kin. The &s;hirts and &s;hifts of the Icelanders are generally of thin bays, or &s;lannel, though the better &s;ort wear them of a kind of coar&s;e linnen. The men, in fi&s;hing, wear a garment of &s;heep-&s;kin over their cloaths, and this they frequently &s;often by daubing it with fi&s;h-liver.
<PB N="133" REF="1420">
The habitations in Iceland nearly re&s;emble tho&s;e of Norway; with this difference, that as they are not &s;o well &s;upplied with timber, they make more u&s;e of &s;tones, turf, and mud-walls. The better &s;ort po&s;&s;e&s;s tolerable hou&s;es, well furni&s;hed. The farmers are ill-provided with gla&s;s, in lieu of which they commonly u&s;e the membranes of &s;heep for their windows; and the&s;e tran&s;mit a tolerable de|gree of light, by which they &s;ee to work within doors. Their roofs are either boarded or thatched, and their walls are comfortably thick and warm.</P>
<P>The Icelanders are remarkably ingenious and docile. The country not only affords a great num|ber of able boat-carpenters and handicraft&s;men, but has likewi&s;e produced many men of di&s;tin|gui&s;hed learning. Such is their genius or capacity for the mechanic arts, that many per&s;ons make great progre&s;s in different branches, without having received the lea&s;t in&s;truction. As there are no public &s;chools in this country, the children are taught to read and in&s;tructed in the articles of religion at home by their own parents, or by the mini&s;ters of the different pari&s;hes, in the cour&s;e of their vi&s;itations. The people of Iceland do not mea&s;ure time by the clock or hour; but take their ob&s;ervations from the &s;un, &s;tars, or tide, which la&s;t is always regular, and parcel out the day into different divi&s;ions, each of the&s;e having its own appellation; &s;uch as midnight, twilight, broad-day, forenoon, noon, afternoon, evening, mid-evening, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> They weave, mill, and full their coar&s;e bays, called vadmel, in a very auk|ward, laborious, and imperfect manner. The women u&s;e neither &s;oap nor lye in wa&s;hing their cloaths; but &s;ave urine alone for this purpo&s;e. By means of urine too they extract verdigrea&s;e from copper ve&s;&s;els, and with this they dye their wool|len
<PB N="134" REF="1430">
yarn. Thus they are enabled to make pretty &s;triped &s;tuffs of various colours.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The exports of Iceland con&s;i&s;t of dried fi&s;h, &s;alted mutton and lamb, beef, butter, tallow, train|oil, coar&s;e woollen cloth, &s;tockings, gloves, raw wool, &s;heep-&s;kins, lamb-&s;kins, fox furs of various colours, edder-down, feathers, and formerly &s;ul|phur; but there is no longer a demand for this mineral. On the other hand, the Icelanders im|port timber, fi&s;hing-lines and hooks, tobacco, bread, hor&s;e-&s;hoes, brandy, wine, &s;alt, linnen, a little &s;ilk, and a few other nece&s;&s;aries, as well as &s;uperfluities for the better &s;ort. The whole trade of Iceland is engro&s;&s;ed by a monopoly of Danes, indulged with an exclu&s;ive charter. This com|pany maintains factories at all the harbours of Ice|land, where they exchange their foreign goods for the merchandize of the country; and, as the bal|lance is in favour of the Icelanders, pay the over|plus in Dani&s;h money, which is the only current coin in this i&s;land. All their accompts and pay|ments are adju&s;ted according to the number of fi&s;h: two pounds of fi&s;h are worth two &s;killings in &s;pe|cie, and eight and forty fi&s;h amount to one rix|dollar. A Dani&s;h crown is computed at thirty fi&s;h: what falls under the value of twelve fi&s;h, cannot be payed in money; but mu&s;t be bartered either for fi&s;h or roll-tobacco, an ell of which is equal to one fi&s;h.

The &s;pace in which they are &s;cat|tered extends about &s;ixty miles in length, and forty in breadth, to the we&s;tward of Norway; having Shetland and the Orkneys on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and Greenland and Iceland upon the north and north|we&s;t.

In Stromoe there is a very high hill, called Skellingsfels, that &s;erves as a direction for &s;ailors bound to the north en|trance of Thor&s;haven, on the &s;outhermo&s;t part of the i&s;land, which is the chief &s;eat of trade. The &s;mall i&s;land Kolter boa&s;ts a mountain, that ri&s;es two hundred fathoms above the &s;urface of the water. The i&s;land Store-diemen, being of a round figure, and about a large mile in diameter, is quite &s;ur|rounded by perpendicular rocks, except at one place, where one man at a time can hardly gain admittance; &s;o that it might, with very little ex|pence, be rendered an impregnable fortre&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>CURRENTS, WHIRLPOOLS, LAKES, and FOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>The currents and &s;treams that run between the i&s;lands are extremely violent; and when the wind blows &s;trongly again&s;t them, the conflict produces a very turbulent agitation of the &s;ea. Here are
<PB N="137" REF="1460">
&s;everal whirlpools; but the mo&s;t dangerous of all is that near the rock called the Monk, in which divers &s;hips have been &s;wallowed down, &s;hattered to pieces, and thrown up again in fragments. In the middle of this gulph the water is not above twelve fathoms deep: the ground is rocky, pointed, and circumvoluted like a conch-&s;hell, with &s;harp prominences or cliffs about eight fathoms long, and twelve fathoms di&s;tant one from another. At a little di&s;tance from this inner vortex, the &s;ea is be|tween twenty-five and thirty fathoms in depth; and farther out, a great deal deeper. In the very center there is a deep hole, the bottom of which is about &s;ixty fathoms from the &s;urface. On the ea&s;t &s;ide there is a gulph, through which the &s;ea runs in as through a &s;luice. When any ve&s;&s;el is &s;ucked within the central cliffs, it is whirled round four circles with &s;uch rapidity, that the people on board lie down, to avoid being giddy; and, on this occa&s;ion, the compa&s;s being &s;poiled, runs round with the whirlpool. The&s;e circum&s;tances have been learned in very calm weather, and at low water, when people have ventured upon it, in their way to the rock called the Monk, on which they catch abundance of &s;ea-fowl. They likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that on the top of this rock the air is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive cold, even in the hotte&s;t day of &s;ummer, that they can &s;carce endure it, and the fowl are &s;o lean as to yield nothing but feathers. This cold is &s;up|po&s;ed to proceed from &s;ome magnetic virtue in the rock, which likewi&s;e affects the needle of the compa&s;s.</P>
<P>The Farroe i&s;lands are well &s;upplied with fre&s;h whol&s;ome water from plenty of fountains, &s;ome of them on the tops of the highe&s;t mountains; from whence they trickle down, and form rivu|lets to water the &s;ubjacent plains. There is one medicinal &s;pring in the i&s;land of O&s;teroe, &s;up|po&s;ed to flow over a bed of &s;ulphur, becau&s;e
<PB N="138" REF="1470">
the water is warmer in winter than that of other fountains. In Suderoe, pretty high up in a moun|tain, we find a &s;mall lake, the water of which ebbs and flows with the &s;ea.</P>

<HEAD>LIGHT, AIR, and CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>At the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice there is no night for a whole month in the&s;e i&s;lands, the &s;un being but a few degrees under the horizon. In the longe&s;t day the &s;un ri&s;es &s;even minutes after two in the morning, and &s;ets fifty-three minutes after nine: but the light is continued in the twilight and dawn. In the &s;horte&s;t day the &s;un ri&s;es fifty-three minutes after nine in the morning, and &s;ets &s;even minutes after two in the afternoon: the dawn and twilight, however, eke out this &s;hort day, in &s;uch a manner, that the people can &s;ee to work from eight in the morning till four in the afternoon.</P>
<P>The air is moi&s;t, as in all hilly countries, en|vironed by the &s;ea; and &s;o temperate, with re&s;pect to heat and cold, that the natives allow their hor&s;es and &s;heep to graze abroad all the winter. But the number, height, and arrangement of their mountains, rocks, and hills, collect &s;uch enormous clouds, and break the current of the air in &s;uch a manner, as produces the mo&s;t violent and &s;udden bla&s;ts, &s;torms, and whirlwinds. Nay, the tops of the mountains are frequently &s;ubject to terrible agitations of wind, when the atmo&s;phere is &s;o calm in the valleys, that the inhabitants carry lighted candles from hou&s;e to hou&s;e, without any danger of their being extingui&s;hed. The whirlwinds are &s;o &s;udden and dangerous, that the people, being forewarned of their approach, by a dreadful noi&s;e among the rocks, take immediate precautions to elude their fury. The mariner forthwith furls his &s;a$ls: the traveller at land alights from his hor&s;e,
<PB N="139" REF="1480">
throws him&s;elf flat on his face, and clings to gra&s;s, bu&s;hes, or &s;tones, until the bla&s;t be over.</P>

<HEAD>SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, VEGETABLES, and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>The rocks in the&s;e i&s;lands are, for the mo&s;t part, covered with a thin coat of earth, that yields &s;ome pa&s;ture for the &s;heep. In the valleys we find a rich mould, about two feet in thickne&s;s, which produces plenty of gra&s;s and barley; the only &s;pecies of corn that will here come to maturity. Their pa&s;tures are &s;o fat, that a &s;mall ox frequently yields an hundred pounds of tallow. It is ob&s;erved, that the vegetation of the corn and gra&s;s is &s;carce perceivable at the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice, when there is no darkne&s;s; but that they grow apace as the night begins to lengthen. Here are no trees but willows, and &s;ome low &s;hrubs of ju|niper. The natives have planted fruit-trees with|out &s;ucce&s;s. Their chief fuel is turf; though coal is found in &s;ome parts, but worked with great difficulty. No mines have as yet been di&s;covered on the i&s;lands of Farroe: but they yield &s;ome talc, a &s;mall quantity of &s;orry chry&s;tal, and a mean &s;ort of yellow &s;tones re&s;embling the topaz. Here like|wi&s;e are found a few pearl mu&s;cles.</P>

<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The farmers of the&s;e i&s;lands breed hor&s;es, horned cattle, and &s;heep. The&s;e are all of &s;mall &s;ize, and generally provide for them&s;elves in the fields during winter, as well as &s;ummer, except when the &s;now lies very deep. The hor&s;es are &s;trong, &s;wift, and &s;o &s;ure-footed, that in climbing hills and rocks, a man thinks him&s;elf much more &s;ecure on hor&s;eback than a-foot. They are never &s;hod; and the natives train them to hunt wild &s;heep: for &s;ome of their flocks roam wild upon
<PB N="140" REF="1490">
the hills and mountains; and &s;ome are kept tame in &s;eparate inclo&s;ures: yet even the&s;e have nothing but earthen dykes to defend them from the north winds in winter. A number of &s;heep are &s;ome|times covered with a wreath of &s;now, and remain in this condition for two or three weeks; during which they dig for the roots of the gra&s;s, and even eat the wool off one another. The&s;e i&s;lands are haunted by &s;warms of land and &s;ea-fowls, which yield them great &s;tore of fle&s;h and eggs for food; of down and feathers for &s;ale. But the article in which the natives heretofore found their greate&s;t advantage was the fi&s;hery, which is now greatly decayed. Neverthele&s;s, they &s;till catch abundance of cod, whiting, flounders, pilchards, and other fi&s;h, that &s;warm in the northern &s;ea: but having no &s;alt, they cannot cure them for exportation. Of &s;eals they kill a great number every year: the&s;e animals are &s;ometimes taken by dogs, trained to the &s;port. They &s;wim towards the &s;eal again&s;t the wind, that the &s;mell may not be perceived, then &s;eize him by the throat, and hold him until the ma&s;ter can come up and put him to death. They are likewi&s;e caught in nets, and knocked down with clubs, in caverns where they litter. The &s;kin is made into &s;hoes, pouches, and other kinds of furniture. The fle&s;h is eaten: part of the fat is melted into train-oil; and part of it &s;alted up for food with a &s;ort of coar&s;e black &s;alt, extracted from the a&s;hes of burnt &s;ea-weed.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the&s;e i&s;lands likewi&s;e kill many &s;mall whales, from &s;ix to &s;ixteen feet in length: they approach the land in great numbers, when the wea|ther is dark or hazy: then the fi&s;hermen a&s;&s;emble in their boats, and, by &s;houting and throwing &s;tones, drive them into creeks and inlets, where they are killed with whale-&s;pears, and hauled on &s;hore. The tythe being fir&s;t deducted, one fi&s;h
<PB N="141" REF="1500">
is allotted as a premium to him who fir&s;t di&s;covered the &s;hoal: the re&s;t are divided into two equal parts, one for the fi&s;hermen, and the other for the pro|prietor of the land where the whales are brought a&s;hore. The fat is either melted into oil, &s;alted up as bacon, or u&s;ed as butter. The fle&s;h is eaten, and ta&s;tes like beef: part of it they cut into long &s;lices, and dry in the wind: the tail eats like cow|heel, and is often pickled by the people of different nations.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The LANGUAGE, RELIGION, LAWS, and GOVERNMENT of the&s;e ISLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>The people of Farroe &s;peak the Norwegian dia|lect, with a mixture of Dani&s;h idioms. They profe&s;s the Lutheran religion, under the eccle&s;ia&s;|tical juri&s;diction of a provo&s;t. The whole country is divided into &s;even di&s;tricts, containing thirty|nine pari&s;hes. Their churches are mean, their livings very &s;mall, and the inhabitants of the little remote i&s;lands very ill &s;erved, on account of the boi&s;terous weather, and dangerous &s;treams by which they are divided. There is but one &s;chool, which is e&s;tabli&s;hed at their chief town Thor&s;haven: the prie&s;t of that place is ma&s;ter, and has an ex|traordinary &s;alary from the king for this office. Some &s;tudents from this i&s;land are entertained gratis, and bred up as clergymen, at the univer&s;ity of Copenhagen.</P>
<P>The Farroe i&s;lands are &s;ubject to the king of Denmark, who confers the government of them upon &s;ome per&s;on of quality at court. The go|vernor appoints a deputy, and &s;heriffs, to admi|ni&s;ter ju&s;tice, and &s;uperintend the commerce of the&s;e i&s;lands, which are divided into &s;ix di&s;tricts or provinces. Each of the&s;e is provided with a &s;heriff, who determines &s;mall cau&s;es in his own
<PB N="142" REF="1510">
province: but matters of importance are referred to the great annual &s;e&s;&s;ion at Thor&s;haven, in which the deputy-governor pre&s;ides. There is likewi&s;e a &s;pring &s;e&s;&s;ion in every di&s;trict, held by this deputy, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the &s;ix &s;heriffs, a &s;worn recorder, and the clergy of the province. The &s;ame gentleman is, moreover, pre&s;ident of the &s;ynod held annually for the determination of eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, with the advice and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the provo&s;t and his clergy. The laws of Denmark prevail in the&s;e i&s;lands: yet they have particular &s;tatutes of their own, and among others the <HI>&s;heep ordinance,</HI> relating to the oeconomy of their flocks, a&s;certaining their property in the &s;heep as well as in the inclo&s;ures for pa&s;ture.</P>

<HEAD>Their CHARACTER, MANNERS, CUS|TOMS, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>The people of the&s;e i&s;lands are mild, humble, extremely ho&s;pitable, religious, and temperate: they live commonly on fle&s;h, fi&s;h, milk, or gruel, without ta&s;ting either bread, &s;alt, or beer, except at Chri&s;tmas, when they indulge them&s;elves with extraordinary cheer. Their u&s;ual cloathing is of coar&s;e flannel. The men wear &s;hort wide coats: their women appear in boddice and petticoats, &s;ewed together; but the holiday garments are of a better &s;tuff, and different colours: linnen, how|ever, is &s;eldom u&s;ed. They make all their own cloaths, and indeed every thing for which they have occa&s;ion. They are univer&s;al handicraft&s;men, and excel the Norwegians in the branch of boat|carpenters. They are not only par&s;imonious in their meals, and frugal in their apparel, but al&s;o utter &s;trangers to every elegance of life. They lie upon beds of hay, covered with blankets. They a&s;&s;ign to their female &s;ervants a certain quantity of
<PB N="143" REF="1520">
wool, which mu&s;t be knit or &s;pun within the day. Both &s;exes are almo&s;t continually employed: the women in weaving, knitting, and dying; the men in all other kinds of work. They very &s;eldom in|dulge them&s;elves with che&s;s, or any other pa&s;time, except on holidays, fe&s;tivals, and weddings: then they &s;ing p&s;alms, or ballads, amu&s;e them&s;elves with the che&s;s-board, or gambol in ru&s;tic dances. They naturally ob&s;erve the &s;tars, and are particularly acquainted with the con&s;tellation Ur&s;a Major, by which they di&s;tingui&s;h the hours in the winter-mornings. The age of the moon they know by the increa&s;e and decrea&s;e of the tides, and thus compute the fixed and moveable fea&s;ts with great preci&s;ion.</P>

<HEAD>The COMMERCE, STRENGTH, and RE|VENUE of the FARROE ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>Their commerce, which is very incon&s;iderable, con&s;i&s;ts in their exporting to the neare&s;t continent of Norway or Denmark, wool, woollen-cloths of different finene&s;s, knit caps, gloves, and &s;tockings, butter, train-oil, tallow, boats, down and feathers. The&s;e i&s;lands having been &s;ubject to piratical inva|&s;ions, king Chri&s;tian IV. built a ca&s;tle at Thor&s;|haven in the i&s;land of Stromoe, for the defence of that town, which is their chief &s;eat of traffick. The court of Denmark arbitrarily impo&s;es a tri|bute, or tax, in which the&s;e poor i&s;landers are obliged to acquie&s;ce: but this mu&s;t be a meer trifle, if at all proportionable to the lowne&s;s of their circum&s;tances.</P>

<P>THE antient <HI>Dania,</HI> or Denmark, properly &s;o called, con&s;i&s;ts of Jutland, the Cher&s;o|ne&s;us Cimbrica of the antients, which is part of the continent, and &s;everal i&s;lands in the Baltic. Jutland lies between the 54th and 59th degrees of north latitude, and from the 8th to the 15th degrees of longitude ea&s;t from London, &s;tretching from &s;outh to north about two hundred and twenty-four miles; being in breadth about twenty-four miles, at its broade&s;t part: on the we&s;t and north it is wa&s;hed by the German ocean: it is bounded on the ea&s;t by the Schager-rock, or Cate|gate, and the Middle-fort Sound, or Le&s;&s;er Belt; and on the &s;outh the river Elbe divides it from the dutchies of Bremen and Lunenburg. This part of the continent includes the dutchies of Sle&s;wic and Hol&s;tein, though this la&s;t is a fief of the empire. The other part, reckoned the mo&s;t con&s;iderable half of Denmark, is con&s;tituted by the i&s;lands of

<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>Jutland is encumbered with barren mountains; but the interjacent vallies abound with excellent pa&s;turage; yet the country, in general, produces very little corn. The mo&s;t remarkable river of Denmark is the Eyder; which takes its ri&s;e near Segeberg, runs by Rend&s;bourg, and di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the &s;ea at Tonningen, after having di|vided Sle&s;wick from Hol&s;tein. There is not, how|ever, one river in Denmark navigable to &s;hips of any con&s;iderable burthen; for the Elbe does not properly belong to this country, though it forms one of the confines. There are &s;ome fre&s;h-water lakes in the continental part of the kingdom, well repleni&s;hed with delicious fi&s;h, and plenty of pure fountains and rivulets: the fre&s;h water in the i&s;lands, however, is extremely foul and di&s;agree|able. The face of the country is al&s;o &s;haded with large fore&s;ts, well &s;tocked with a variety of game. But, notwith&s;tanding the maritime &s;ituation of this kingdom, there is neither upon the continent, nor on the i&s;lands, one tolerable harbour, except that of Copenhagen, which is an excellent &s;ea-port.</P>

<P>The cold in Denmark is not &s;o &s;evere as in &s;ome other parts of Germany, that are more to the &s;outh|ward. The air is here tempered by the vapours from the &s;ea, that &s;urrounds it almo&s;t on every part. The &s;ame neighbourhood contributes to the mitigation of the &s;ummer's heat, by ventilating breezes. Here, however, we perceive no gradual &s;pring, nor intermediate autumn; but a &s;udden
<PB N="146" REF="1550">
tran&s;ition from cold to heat, and from &s;ultry wea|ther again to all the rigors of winter; &s;o that in fact, there are but two &s;ea&s;ons in Denmark. In the months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, the heat is very trouble&s;ome, the atmo&s;phere being clo&s;e, gloomy, and &s;urcharged with vapours. At this period, the city of Copenhagen is &s;o pe&s;tered with flies, that the people have recour&s;e to a poi&s;oned water, with which they &s;prinkle their kitchens and apartments.

<HEAD>SOIL: PRODUCTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;oil varies in different places on the conti|nent, and in the i&s;lands. There are good pa&s;|tures in all parts of the kingdom: the mountains here, as every where el&s;e, are barren; the vallies, fertile; but the &s;oil in the i&s;lands is commonly &s;andy, and requires frequent rains, to produce even tolerable crops of rye.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The Danes breed va&s;t herds of kine, flocks of &s;heep, hogs, and an excellent race of hor&s;es; but their cattle are &s;mall and meagre, except in the &s;ummer, when the beef is &s;weet and juicy. We|ther mutton was heretofore unknown in Denmark; and therefore this &s;pecies was generally eaten in lamb. The woods and fore&s;ts are inhabited by &s;tags, elks, and boars, hares, and all the quadru|peds found in other mild countries. Here is great plenty of poultry and wild fowl; and the &s;ea &s;warms with a variety of fi&s;h, &s;uch as we have de&s;cribed in our account of Norway: but on the &s;ide of the Baltic, the Danes are very ill &s;upplied, whether from the indolence and want of &s;kill of the inhabi|tants, or (which is more likely) from the nature of

</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE, RELIGION, LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>The language of Denmark is a dialect of the Teutonic, and bears a &s;trong affinity to the Nor|wegian tongue; but is di&s;agreeable to &s;trangers, on account of the drawling tone with which it is pro|nounced. They have borrowed many words from the Germans; and, indeed, the high Dutch is u&s;ed in common di&s;cour&s;e by the court, the gentry, and the burghers. The better &s;ort likewi&s;e under&s;tand French, and &s;peak it fluently. The Lutheran doctrine is univer&s;ally embraced through all Den|mark, Sweden, and Norway; &s;o that there is not another &s;ect in the&s;e kingdoms. Denmark is di|vided into &s;ix dioce&s;es, one in Zealand, one in Fu|nen, and four in Jutland: but the bi&s;hops are, properly &s;peaking, no other than &s;uperintendants, or <HI>primi inter pares.</HI> They have no cathedrals, ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical courts, or temporalities. Their bu&s;ine&s;s is to in&s;pect the doctrine and morals of the inferior clergy. They are not di&s;tingui&s;hed from other mi|ni&s;ters by their habit, which con&s;i&s;ts of a black gown with &s;hort &s;leeves, a large ruff about the neck, and a round cap with edges, like tho&s;e worn by our ma&s;ters of arts. The revenue of the bi&s;hop of Copenhagen amounts to about two thou&s;and rixdollars; and this is the riche&s;t benefice in the kingdom. The clergy are wholly dependent on the government. They never intermeddle, nor are employed or con&s;ulted in civil affairs. They, neverthele&s;s, have acquired great influence, and erected a &s;ort of &s;piritual tyranny over the minds of the common people, by whom they are much revered. They preach without notes, and inveigh &s;everely again&s;t the vices of the great, whom they &s;cruple not to attack per&s;onally. The commonalty
<PB N="148" REF="1570">
admire their courage, and the government con|nives at their pre&s;umption, while they confine them|&s;elves to their own province of preaching. They are, generally &s;peaking, men of exemplary lives, and &s;ome erudition. Their churches are kept more clean, and better adorned than tho&s;e of England: the people are great lovers of mu&s;ick, and their or|gani&s;ts commonly entertain the congregation for half an hour before or after &s;ervice. The &s;tate of literature is very low in Denmark. There is, in|deed, an univer&s;ity at Copenhagen, but meanly endowed, and very ill &s;upplied with ma&s;ters. Ta&s;te and the belles lettres are utterly unknown in this country, which yet has produced &s;ome men of great eminence in mathematics and medicine; &s;uch as Tycho Brahe, Borrichius, and the Bartho|lines.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION, GOVERNMENT, and LAWS.</HEAD>
<P>The con&s;titution of Denmark was heretofore of the free Gothic original. The convention of the e&s;tates, even including the repre&s;entatives of the boors or pea&s;ants, elected a king for his per&s;onal virtues, having &s;till a regard to the &s;on of their late monarch, whom, however, they made no &s;cruple of &s;etting a&s;ide, if they deemed him un|worthy of the royal dignity. They enacted laws, conferred the great offices of &s;tate, debated all af|fairs relating to commerce, peace, war, and alli|ances, and occa&s;ionally gave their con&s;ent to the im|po&s;ition of nece&s;&s;ary taxes. The king was no other than chief magi&s;trate, generali&s;&s;imo, and as it were prime mini&s;ter to his people. His bu&s;ine&s;s was to &s;ee ju&s;tice admini&s;tered impartially; to command the army in time of war; to encourage indu&s;try, religion, arts, and &s;ciences; and to watch over the
<PB N="149" REF="1580">
intere&s;ts of his &s;ubjects. He had no public reve|nue from the &s;tate, but lived like a private noble|man from the produce of his own lands and de|me&s;nes. Such was the con&s;titution of Denmark, till the year 1660, when it underwent a very &s;trange and &s;urpri&s;ing revolution. At the conclu&s;ion of the peace with Sweden, the nation re&s;ounded with the clamour of mi&s;ery and di&s;content. There was nothing left in the public trea&s;ury, to pay off and di&s;band the army, which therefore became in&s;olent and licentious. The common people, and even the burghers, were exhau&s;ted by the long, expen|&s;ive war: the clergy were un&s;atisfied with their condition and want of importance; and the nobi|lity were become proud and tyrannical. When the e&s;tates a&s;&s;embled to deliberate and redre&s;s the grivances of the nation, the commons propo&s;ed that an equal tax &s;hould be laid upon all per&s;ons, without di&s;tinction, in proportion to their circum|&s;tances. The nobles pleaded their privilege of be|ing exempted from all impo&s;ition. The burghers alledged, that as the nobility engro&s;&s;ed all the lands and riches of the kingdom, it was rea&s;onable that they &s;hould bear their &s;hare of the common burthen: violent di&s;putes en&s;ued. At length a nobleman, called Otto Craeg, &s;tood up, and, in a tran&s;port of pa&s;&s;ion, told the commons, that they neither under&s;tood the privileges of the nobility, who were always exempted from &s;uch impo&s;itions, nor the condition of them&s;elves, who were no other than their &s;laves. This inglorious term produced an immediate ferment in the a&s;&s;embly; and the hall re&s;ounded with murmurs and altercation. Nan&s;on, &s;peaker of the commons, &s;tarting up in a rage of indignation, &s;wore that the nobility &s;hould repent their having branded the commons with &s;uch an opprobrious epithet. He had previou&s;ly concerted the de&s;ign with the bi&s;hop of Copenha|gen,
<PB N="150" REF="1590">
and the court was not ignorant of their inten|tion. The clergy and burghers, breaking up in di&s;order, marched under the au&s;pices of the&s;e lea|ders to the brewer's hall, where, after much de|bate, they agreed to make a &s;olemn tender of their freedom and &s;ervices to the king, that he might become ab&s;olute monarch of the realm, and &s;ee the right of hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion e&s;tabli&s;hed in his fa|mily. Next morning they marched in couples, each burgher being paired with a clergyman, through the &s;treets, which were filled with the po|pulace, who &s;houted as they pa&s;&s;ed, to the coun|cil-hall, where the nobles had rea&s;&s;embled. There Nan&s;on, in a &s;hort harangue, &s;ignified the intention of the clergy and commons, demanded the concur|rence of the nobles, and threatened that, in ca&s;e of a refu&s;al, they would forthwith proceed without them to the palace. The nobles were confounded and aba&s;hed. They endeavoured to gain time: they profe&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of concurring with the other &s;tates; but de&s;ired that an affair of &s;uch con&s;e|quence might not be precipitated. The others be|ing deaf to their remon&s;trances and intreaties, con|tinued their proce&s;&s;ion to the palace, where they were met by the prime mini&s;ter, who conducted them to the hall of audience. There the bi&s;hop of Copenhagen, in a florid &s;peech, as deputy from the two orders, made a &s;olemn tender to the king of an ab&s;olute and hereditary dominion; a&s;&s;uring his maje&s;ty, that he might command their pur&s;es and arms, to &s;upport a mea&s;ure &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to the welfare of his people. The king received them graciou&s;ly, a&s;&s;ented to the propo&s;al, thanked them for their zeal and confidence, and a&s;&s;ured them they might depend upon his royal favour and protection. The city-gates were immediately &s;hut, that none of the &s;enators &s;hould e&s;cape: a precau|tion by which the nobles were &s;o intimidated, that
<PB N="151" REF="1600">
they immediately &s;ignified their readine&s;s to concur with the &s;tep which the other two orders had taken. Preparations were forthwith made for this &s;trange inauguration. Scaffolds were rai&s;ed in the open &s;pace before the ca&s;tle; and the troops and burghers received orders to appear in arms, under their re|&s;pective officers. On the &s;ixteenth day of October, in the year 1660, the king, queen, and royal family, a&s;cended an open theatre, and placing them&s;elves on chairs of &s;tate, under canopies of velvet, received in public the homage of all the &s;enators, nobility, clergy, and commons, couched in an oath of al|legiance compo&s;ed for the purpo&s;e. Thus the people, with a ra&s;h and de&s;perate hand, from mo|tives of revenge, fomented by an artful mini&s;try and ambitious clergy, re&s;igned their liberty and independence, and inve&s;ted their &s;overeign with a de&s;potic power over their lives and fortunes. The king of Denmark is now &s;o ab&s;olute, that he not only can impo&s;e what tolls and taxes he &s;hall think convenient; but al&s;o, by a maxim in the pre&s;ent juri&s;prudence of that nation, he enjoys the prero|gative of explaining the law, and even of altering it occa&s;ionally.</P>
<P>The laws of Denmark are ju&s;t, equitable, per|&s;picuous, and &s;o conci&s;e that the whole body is contained in one quarto volume, written in the language of the country. Every man may plead his own cau&s;e, without employing either council or attorney: but there are a few advocates for the benefit of tho&s;e who cannot or will not &s;peak in their own defence. The proceedings are &s;o &s;ummary, that a &s;uit may be carried through all the courts, and finally decided in thirteen months. There are three courts in Denmark, and an appeal lies from the inferior to the &s;uperior tribunal. The lowe&s;t of the&s;e is in cities and towns, denominated
<PB N="152" REF="1610">
the <HI>Byfoglids Court,</HI> and in the country the <HI>Herred&s;|fougds.</HI> Cau&s;es may be appealed from this to the <HI>Land&s;tag,</HI> or general head court for the province: but the final appeal lies to the court of <HI>High-right</HI> in Copenhagen, where the king pre&s;ides in per|&s;on, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the prime nobility. The judges of the two other courts are appointed by his ma|je&s;ty's letters patent, to &s;it and determine cau&s;es <HI>durante bene placito.</HI> The&s;e are puni&s;hable for any mi&s;demeanours of which they may be guilty; and when convicted of having pa&s;&s;ed an unju&s;t &s;entence, they are condemned to make reparation to the in|jured party. Their &s;alaries are very incon&s;iderable, and paid out of the king's trea&s;ury, from the fines of delinquents, be&s;ides a &s;mall gratuity from the plaintiff and defendant when &s;entence is pa&s;&s;ed. In a word, here is no encouragement for chica|nery, and no countenance given to corruption. Such is the peculiar privelege enjoyed by the city of Copenhagen, that cau&s;es appealed from the <HI>Byfoglids Court,</HI> in&s;tead of pa&s;&s;ing through the provincial court, are tried by the burgoma&s;ter and common council; from whence they proceed im|mediately to the highe&s;t court, as the la&s;t re&s;ource. Affairs relating to the revenue are determined in the rent-chamber of Denmark, which is analogous to our court of exchequer. To another tribunal, compo&s;ed of &s;ome members from this rent-chamber, from the admiralty, and college of commerce, mer|chants appeal for redre&s;s, when their commodities are &s;eized for non-payment of duties. All di&s;|putes relating to the &s;ea are determined by the court of admiralty, con&s;tituted of commi&s;&s;ioners appointed for the&s;e purpo&s;es. The chancellary may be more properly termed a &s;ecretary's office. It con&s;i&s;ts of clerks, who write and i&s;&s;ue all the king's decrees and citations, tran&s;cribe papers,
<PB N="153" REF="1620">
and, according to the directions they receive, make draughts of treaties and alliances with other na|tions. The government of Denmark is very com|mendable for the excellent policy it maintains. Ju&s;tice is executed upon criminals with great &s;e|verity; and &s;uch regulations are e&s;tabli&s;hed as effec|tually prevent tho&s;e outrages that are daily com|mitted in other countries. No man pre&s;umes to wag his tongue again&s;t the government, far le&s;s to hatch &s;chemes of trea&s;on. All the &s;ubjects are, or &s;eem to be, attached to their &s;overeign by the ties of affection. Robbery on the highway, bur|glary, coining or clipping, are crimes &s;eldom or never heard of in Denmark. The capital crimes u&s;ually committed are theft and man&s;laughter. Such offenders are beheaded very dexterou&s;ly with one &s;troke of a &s;word. The executioner, though infamous, is commonly rich: becau&s;e, over and above the functions of his office, he is employed in other &s;candalous occupations, which no other per&s;on will undertake. He, by means of his un|der&s;trapper, called the Pracher, empties all the jakes, and removes from hou&s;es, &s;tables, or &s;treets, dead dogs and hor&s;es, which no other Dane will vouch&s;afe to touch on any con&s;ideration what&s;o|ever.</P>
<P>In Copenhagen there is a ma&s;ter of the police, who &s;uperintends the oeconomy of that city. He in&s;pects all &s;orts of merchandize, and compromi&s;es the differences that ari&s;e between traders and handicraft&s;men, when they interfere with the pro|fe&s;&s;ions of each other. He takes care that the public buildings, draw-bridges, and canals be kept in repair; that the &s;treets are well paved, clean&s;ed, and free of incumbrances. He prevents the prac|tice of &s;muggling prohibited goods; regulates the price of bread, and the rates of travelling; puni&s;hes extortioners and poachers; &s;uppre&s;&s;es riots, and
<PB N="154" REF="1630">
provides immediate a&s;&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;e of fire. There are &s;elect companies appointed for this purpo&s;e. The chimney-&s;weepers are bound to keep a regi&s;|ter of all the chimnies they &s;weep, that in ca&s;e of an accident from a foul vent the owner may be convicted, and puni&s;hed for his avarice or neglect. No torches are allowed to be carried through the &s;treets of this city, becau&s;e great part of the hou&s;es are of timber, and the wind is generally high. In lieu of flambeaux, the court and quality u&s;e large round lanthorns, fixed to the end of long poles. In a word, the ma&s;ter of the police regulates every thing that relates to the decency, good order, quiet, and &s;ecurity of the capital. The apothecaries in this kingdom are under excellent regulations: their number at Copenhagen is re&s;tricted to two; and one is allowed to every other town of importance. They are examined and appointed by the college of phy&s;icians, and confirmed by the king him&s;elf; otherwi&s;e they cannot exerci&s;e the profe&s;&s;ion. Their &s;hops are vi&s;ited three times a year by the magi&s;|trates, accompanied with phy&s;icians, who in&s;pect their medicines and regulate the prices. They are obliged to keep an exact account of every thing they &s;ell, to &s;pecify the name of the per&s;on who bought it, and that of the doctor by whom it was pre&s;cribed; &s;o that accidents are prevented, and murders by poi&s;on ea&s;ily di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Denmark is divided into &s;even di&s;tricts, four of which are included in Jutland, and the other three in the i&s;lands: each of the&s;e is &s;ubdivided into three le&s;&s;er juri&s;dictions, called <HI>Ampts.</HI> Over every di&s;trict the king appoints a governor, or <HI>Stifts|ampts-man,</HI> of the be&s;t quality: his deputy the <HI>Ampts-man</HI> is u&s;ually a gentleman, who re&s;ides in the principal town of the di&s;trict, and takes all the trouble from his &s;uperior: he collects the king's revenues, a&s;&s;igns quarters to the &s;oldiers,
<PB N="155" REF="1640">
provides for them on the march, and employs the pea&s;ants in public works. The governor enjoys a yearly &s;alary of a thou&s;and crowns from the king's trea&s;ury; and his deputy is gratified with four hun|dred: but they enjoy other privileges, which are nece&s;&s;arily annexed to their office. In the regula|tion of public taxes, they find means to &s;hift the burthen from their own e&s;tates: they po&s;&s;e&s;s great power and authority in their &s;everal di&s;tricts, and fleece the pea&s;ants with impunity. The&s;e offices are commonly be&s;towed upon the favourites of the court, and tho&s;e who are intitled to &s;ome provi&s;ion for their faithful &s;ervices.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHARACTER of the PEOPLE: Their MAN|NERS and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>The nobility and gentry of Denmark are all in|cluded in the term Noble&s;&s;e, and formerly there was no di&s;tinctions of title: but, within the&s;e &s;ixty years, &s;ome few favourites have been dignified with the titles of Count and Baron. The&s;e, and the&s;e only, enjoy the privilege to di&s;po&s;e of their e&s;tates by will, otherwi&s;e than in the manner which the law directs. Others, indeed, may make parti|cular di&s;po&s;itions, provided they have intere&s;t &s;uf|ficient to procure the king's approbation and &s;ig|nature. The Dani&s;h noble&s;&s;e, heretofore, lived at their own &s;eats with great magnificence and ho&s;pi|tality; and, at the convention of the e&s;tates, met their king with numerous and &s;uperb retinues: but, &s;ince he became ab&s;olute, they have &s;unk to a very low condition. They are &s;o impoveri&s;hed by exorbitant taxes, that they can hardly procure the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; and, for the mo&s;t part, live ob&s;curely in &s;ome corner of their ruined coun|try palaces, unle&s;s they have intere&s;t enough to obtain a civil or military employment at court. For this purpo&s;e they exert all their indu&s;try, influence,
<PB N="156" REF="1650">
and addre&s;s, that their e&s;tates may be &s;heltered from the exactions of collectors, and find means to defray the expence of their living. They no longer inherit the &s;pirit and virtues of their an|ce&s;tors; but are become &s;ervile, indolent, o&s;ten|tatious, extravagant, and oppre&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>Their general character is a &s;trange compo&s;ition of pride and meanne&s;s, in&s;olence and poverty. If any gentleman can find a purcha&s;er for his e&s;tate, the king, by the Dani&s;h law, has a right to one third of the purcha&s;e-money: but the lands are &s;o burthened with impo&s;itions, that there would be no danger of alienation, even if this re&s;triction was not in force: no per&s;on would offer money for an e&s;tate to be held on &s;uch terms; and &s;ome gen|tlemen have actually offered to make a &s;urrender to the king of large tracts of fertile land, &s;ituated in the i&s;land of Zealand. Con&s;cious that they en|joy their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, thus encumbered, at the nod of an arbitrary &s;overeign, they are at little or no pains to improve their e&s;tates; and they look upon trade as an employment beneath their dignity. They therefore rack their tenants with the utmo&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion, in order to procure the immediate means of gratifying their vanity, gluttony, and extrava|gance. They maintain &s;plendid equipages, wear fine cloaths, drink a va&s;t quantity of French wine, and indulge them&s;elves with eating to exce&s;s. Tho&s;e courtiers who derive money from their em|ployments, in&s;tead of purcha&s;ing land in Den|mark, remit their ca&s;h to the banks of Hamburgh and Am&s;terdam. The merchant and burgher treads in the foot&s;teps of their &s;uperiors: they &s;pend all their gains in luxury and plea&s;ure, with an impa|tient avidity, as if they are afraid of incurring the &s;u&s;picion of affluence, and of being &s;tripped by taxation. The pea&s;ant or boor follows the &s;ame example: no &s;ooner has he earned a rixdollar than
<PB N="157" REF="1660">
he makes ha&s;te to expend it in brandy, le&s;t it &s;hould fall into the hand of his oppre&s;&s;ive land|lord. This lower cla&s;s of people are as ab&s;olute &s;laves as the negroes in the We&s;t-Indies, and &s;ub|&s;i&s;t upon much harder fare. The value of e&s;tates is not computed by the number of acres, but by the &s;tock of boors, who, like the timber, are reckoned parcel of the freehold. Heretofore the Dani&s;h pea&s;ants lived comfortably: they were lodged warm, wore good cloaths, fed upon whol|&s;ome fre&s;h provi&s;ion, and every hou&s;e could pro|duce a parcel of plate, with gold rings, and other ornaments, which they are ambitious of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing even at this day: but now they are quite impo|veri&s;hed, and nothing can be more wretched than their condition. They feed upon &s;tock-fi&s;h, &s;alted meats, and other coar&s;e diet: there is not the lea&s;t piece of furniture of any value in their hou&s;es, except feather-beds, which are excellent, and in great plenty in Denmark: the&s;e are not only u&s;ed as beds to lie upon, but al&s;o as coverings in lieu of blankets. After the boor has laboured like a drudge to rai&s;e the king's taxes, he mu&s;t pay the overplus of his toil to his needy landlord. Should he improve his ground, and repair his farm-hou&s;e, his cruel ma&s;ter will immediately tran&s;plant him from thence to a barren farm, and a naked habi|tation, that he may let the improved ground at a higher price to another tenant. This barbarous practice is &s;uch a di&s;couragement to indu&s;try, that in a little time there will be no farm-hou&s;es in the country, unle&s;s they are rebuilt or repaired at the landlord's expence. The pea&s;ants likewi&s;e &s;u&s;tain abundance of damage and violence from the licen|tious &s;oldiers, that are quartered in their hou&s;es. They are moreover obliged to furni&s;h hor&s;es and waggons for the royal family, and all their at|tendants, when the king makes a progre&s;s through
<PB N="158" REF="1670">
the country, or removes his re&s;idence from one palace to another. On &s;uch occa&s;ions the neigh|bouring boors are &s;ummoned to a&s;&s;emble with their cattle and carriages; and not only obliged to live at their own expence, but al&s;o to bear every &s;pecies of outrage and abu&s;e from the lowe&s;t lacquies of tho&s;e who attend his maje&s;ty. All per&s;ons, of any rank above the vulgar, dre&s;s in the French ta&s;te, and affect finery; but the winter-dre&s;s of the ladies is peculiar to the country, very neat, warm, and becoming. The common people are likewi&s;e re|markably neat, and pride them&s;elves in different changes of linnen. They are very little addicted to jollity and diver&s;ion: their whole amu&s;ements con&s;i&s;t in running at the goo&s;e on Shrove-Tue&s;day, and in being drawn in &s;leds upon the ice during winter: they, moreover, fea&s;t and make merry at weddings and funerals. With re&s;pect to marriage, the man and woman frequently cohabit together on contract, long before the ceremony is per|formed. The nobility and gentry pique them|&s;elves upon &s;umptuous burials and monuments for the dead: the corp&s;e is very often kept in a vault, or the chancel of a church, for &s;everal years, before a proper opportunity occurs for celebrating the funeral.</P>
<P>The warlike genius of the Danes no longer &s;ub|&s;i&s;ts: the common people are mean-&s;pirited, &s;u&s;pi|cious, and deceitful; nor have they that talent for mechanics, and natural ingenuity, &s;o remarkable in &s;ome other northern nations.</P>
<P>While the pea&s;ants are employed without doors in their country labour, the women are occupied at home in &s;pinning yarn for linnen, which is here made to great perfection. The people of Den|mark are very &s;ubject to apoplexies and epilep&s;ies, probably owing to hard drinking, and poor un|whol&s;ome diet; though they frequently die of a
<PB N="159" REF="1680">
&s;pecies of apoplexy, called the <HI>&s;lacht,</HI> which pro|ceeds from grief and anxiety of mind. Con&s;ump|tions, coughs, and catarrhs, are &s;o little known at Copenhagen, that, even in the mid&s;t of winter, there is not the lea&s;t noi&s;e in their churches to di&s;|turb the attention of the audience. The exemp|tion from the&s;e maladies, in &s;uch a cold moi&s;t cli|mate, they probably owe to the purity of their fuel, which con&s;i&s;ts wholly of beech-wood, to their warm &s;toves, and to the comfortable furs they wear as pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the &s;everity of the winter. Strangers are but indifferently lodged in their towns. The taverns are poorly &s;upplied; and he who diets in them mu&s;t be contented to eat in a public room, which is often filled with promi&s;cuous company, unle&s;s he will conde&s;cend to pay an ex|travagant price for a &s;eparate apartment. The me|tropolis is but indifferently furni&s;hed with game. The wild ducks and plover are hardly eatable; but the hares are good, and the markets &s;ometimes pro|duce tolerable roebuck. We have already ob&s;erved that their &s;ea-fi&s;h is not to be commended; but their rivers yield plenty of delicious carp, perch, and craw-fi&s;h. The gardens of the gentry are well &s;tocked with melons, grapes, peaches, and all &s;orts of greens and &s;allads in perfection. Their butter is &s;weet; but their chee&s;e intolerable.</P>
<P>People of fa&s;hion drink French wine, Rheni&s;h, and cherry-brandy: the common people indulge them&s;elves with bad beer, and a hot &s;pirit di&s;tilled from barley.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The commerce of Denmark begins to lift up its head, under the protection and encouragement of a &s;overeign who is the real father of his people. The bloody and expen&s;ive wars by which the two northern crowns of Sweden and Denmark were
<PB N="160" REF="1690">
mutually exhau&s;ted, are now happily concluded; and will &s;carce be revived, while their &s;overeigns continue to pur&s;ue the real intere&s;t of their &s;ubjects. Ru&s;&s;ia has e&s;tabli&s;hed a new power in the Baltic, in order to ballance which they will find it conve|nient to unite for their own pre&s;ervation. The trade of Denmark was formerly confined to a very incon&s;iderable export of fi&s;h, planks, timber, &s;kins, tallow, and live cattle. Their money is reckoned in rixdollars and &s;tivers; the fir&s;t, not quite equal in value to an Engli&s;h crown; the la&s;t, rather more than an Engli&s;h penny. The li&s;pound of Den|mark is equivalent to a &s;tone, and twenty of the&s;e are included in one &s;hip-pound: but the Dani&s;h ell amounts to no more than two thirds of the Engli&s;h mea&s;ure known by that denomination.</P>
<P>About the year 1612, an Ea&s;t-India company was e&s;tabli&s;hed at Copenhagen, under the pro|tection of king Chri&s;tiern IV. and in four years after their e&s;tabli&s;hment the company equipped four &s;hips, which &s;et &s;ail for the Ea&s;t-Indies. The&s;e adventurers made a &s;ettlement on the coa&s;t of Co|romandel, at a place called Tranquebar, which they &s;till retain. Here they built a fort, which is counted the &s;tronge&s;t in the Indies, and even for|tified the town, which is a place of con&s;iderable traffick. A great number of Indians, whom the Dani&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries have converted to the Lutheran religion, &s;ettle and grow rich in Tranquebar. The&s;e form a di&s;tinct colony, able to &s;upport it&s;elf in a flouri&s;hing condition, and to pay a yearly tribute of ten thou&s;and rixdollars to the Dani&s;h company. During the civil wars in England, this commerce was carried on to great advantage: but, &s;ince that period, it has undergone various vici&s;&s;itudes. From the very origin of their e&s;tabli&s;hment the Danes have been embroiled with the neighbouring &s;tates of India, as well as with the other European &s;et|tlements.
<PB N="161" REF="1700">
The&s;e were envious of their &s;trength, and their diamond-trade; a branch of traffick which they pro&s;ecuted to great advantage. In the clo&s;e of the la&s;t century the Rajah of Tanjour, an Indian prince, who&s;e territories bordered on Tran|quebar, was in&s;tigated by the Dutch to declare war again&s;t the Dani&s;h &s;ettlement. He inve&s;ted Tran|quebar with a great army; and, by dint of incre|dible labour, had in five months reduced the gar|ri&s;on to extremity, when they were &s;uccoured by the genero&s;ity of Mr. Pit, the Engli&s;h governor of Fort St. George. This gentleman reinforced them with a body of Engli&s;h troops, who, in repeated &s;allies, harra&s;&s;ed the Indians to &s;uch a degree, that the Rajah, de&s;pairing of being able to reduce the place, rai&s;ed the &s;iege, and marched away. Since that period the Danes have enjoyed their Ea&s;t-India commerce without let or mole&s;tation: they po&s;&s;e&s;s Tranquebar, and the fortre&s;s of Danebourg, which is a regular citadel; together with an adjoining territory, peopled with Moors and Indians, who are their &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of a &s;cheme formed by Jo&s;hua Van A&s;peren, a merchant of the Low Countries, for increa&s;ing the capital and extending the trade of the Dani&s;h Ea&s;t-India company, Frederick IV. in the year 1728, transferred the &s;eat of it from Copenhagen to Altena, a town of great traffick belonging to Denmark, and &s;ituated in the neigh|bourhood of Hamburgh; and granted a new char|ter to the company for promoting their commerce to China, Bengal, and the Indies. The capital was con&s;iderably enlarged, for the&s;e purpo&s;es, by a &s;pirited &s;ub&s;cription, which alarmed France and the Maritime Powers. The Dutch rai&s;ed a proce&s;s again&s;t the projector Van A&s;peren, who, being a &s;ubject of the States, was condemned and executed in effigy. Every objection that could be &s;tarted
<PB N="162" REF="1710">
again&s;t the execution of the &s;cheme, was publi&s;hed in the news-papers of Paris, London, and Am&s;ter|dam, with a view to di&s;courage people from en|gaging in the commerce. The mini&s;ters of Great Britain and Holland, who re&s;ided at the court of Denmark, were ordered to make remon&s;trances to his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty again&s;t this new charter, which they apprehended would interfere with the Ea&s;t-India trade of their &s;ubjects. The king wi&s;ely an|&s;wered, that he was not re&s;tricted by any treaty whatever from &s;upporting and extending the traf|fick of his &s;ubjects by all the means in his power, provided he did not infringe the laws of nature and nations, which he had no intention to violate. The Maritime Powers, finding their repre&s;enta|tions produced no effect, forbade their &s;ubjects to be concerned in the Dani&s;h company; and this prohibition hindered them from executing the &s;cheme in its utmo&s;t extent: neverthele&s;s, they have extended their commerce, and now pro&s;ecute an advantageous trade from Copenhagen to China and the Indies, under the protection and particular encouragement of the reigning king. Their credit is exten&s;ive; their funds are con&s;iderable; their warehou&s;es, magazines, yards, and docks, in com|plete order; and they &s;end annually two or three &s;hips richly loaded to the Ea&s;t-Indies.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tian VI. even in his father's life-time, was very attentive to the intere&s;t of the Ea&s;t-India company; and, indeed, when he a&s;cended the throne, he fully an&s;wered the hopes and expecta|tions of his people, in ea&s;ing them of their &s;evere burthens, and taking every &s;tep for their improve|ment and advantage. He aboli&s;hed a grievous monopoly, which his father had e&s;tabli&s;hed, for the &s;ale of wine, brandy, &s;alt, and tobacco. He agreed to pay a million of rixdollars to the duke of Hol|&s;tein, upon that prince's re&s;igning all preten&s;ions
<PB N="163" REF="1720">
to the dutchy of Sle&s;wick. He terminated an old di&s;pute between the crown of Denmark and the city of Hamburgh; by which agreement he ob|tained half a million of marks of &s;ilver for him&s;elf, and &s;ome valuable conce&s;&s;ions in favour of his people. He in&s;tituted a council of trade, to examine all propo&s;als for the exten&s;ion and encouragement of commerce: he invited arti&s;ts and workmen from foreign countries, and e&s;tabli&s;hed manufactures at his own expence: he erected a bank for the pur|po&s;e of circulation: he maintained a re&s;pectable fleet and army; and, that the&s;e might not become burthen &s;ome to his &s;ubjects, he, from time to time, concluded treaties of &s;ub&s;idy with foreign powers, which always kept his finances in a flouri&s;hing con|dition. In a word, he acted on all occa&s;ions with equal fortitude and di&s;cretion, as a great king, a wi&s;e politician, and a prince who had always at heart the intere&s;ts of his people. His &s;on Frede|rick V. father to the pre&s;ent king of Denmark, wi&s;ely trod in the foot&s;teps of his father. He maintained peace with all his neighbours, encou|raged indu&s;try, promoted trade and manufactures: by means of a well regulated oeconomy, he was en|abled to make con&s;iderable &s;avings; &s;o that he payed off a heavy debt due by the crown, and re|&s;erved con&s;iderable &s;ums to be expended for the good of his kingdom. Between the acce&s;&s;ion of his father to the throne, and that of his &s;on, the pre&s;ent king, the face of affairs has been altered much for the better in Denmark. New channels of trade, and new ports, have been opened: the number of &s;hipping has been doubled, and the revenue in|crea&s;ed in proportion. The court is &s;plendid, with|out profu&s;ion; the king is rich, without oppre&s;&s;ion; re&s;pected abroad as a wi&s;e and powerful monarch, beloved and adored at home as the father and pa|tron of his people. Be&s;ides the Ea&s;t-India trade,
<PB N="164" REF="1730">
the Danes have extended their commerce to the We&s;t-Indies, where they have &s;ettled the i&s;lands of St. Thomas; to the coa&s;t of Guinea, where they maintain the fort of Chri&s;tianburg; to the Mediterranean; and to Greenland.</P>

<HEAD>STRENGTH and REVENUE.</HEAD>
<P>The forces of Denmark, including five thou&s;and re&s;erves, which form a kind of militia, amount to near forty thou&s;and men, hor&s;e, dragoons, and in|fantry. The&s;e la&s;t, officers as well as &s;oldiers, con&s;i&s;t chiefly of &s;trangers, Germans, Poles, Cour|landers, Dutch, Swedes, Scots, and Iri&s;h. The cavalry are generally natives: every pea&s;ant is obliged to maintain a trooper and his hor&s;e, not only in meat, drink, and hou&s;e-room, but likewi&s;e in money to the amount of &s;ix &s;hillings a month; one half of which is payed to the colonel, to de|fray the expence of mounting his men. In Nor|way the foot-&s;oldiers live upon free-quarter among the boors. The pay of a captain amounts to twenty rixdollars a month; that of a lieutenant to eleven: to each common &s;oldier is allotted two rixdollars and thirty-two &s;tivers; but of this he receives no more than &s;eventeen &s;tivers a week: the re&s;t is de|tained for bread, quarters, and cloaths. In time of peace the pay of the hor&s;e-officers is no more than that of the infantry. The dragoons are not obliged to keep hor&s;es, except in time of war; and extraordinary pay is allowed to tho&s;e that are quar|tered in Hol&s;tein. The Dani&s;h troops, though not de&s;picable, have been generallyfoiled by the Swedes, who have wre&s;ted from them &s;ome of their be&s;t provinces, which they &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s; namely, Scho|nen, Halland, Bleking, and Yempterland. The navy of Denmark is numerous and re&s;pectable: it con&s;i&s;ts of about thirty &s;hips of the line, be&s;ides frigates, bombs, tenders, and yachts. That this
<PB N="165" REF="1740">
fleet may be the more ea&s;ily manned on any emer|gency, three thou&s;and &s;eamen are maintained a|&s;hore in time of peace; a certain di&s;trict in the out-&s;kirts of Copenhagen has been allotted to them for their habitation, and there they live rent free with their families in little hou&s;es, built like bar|racks, at the king's expence. Their bu&s;ine&s;s, while on &s;hore, is to work in the holm, or great dock, in which the &s;hips of war are built and re|paired. The pay of the&s;e mariners does not exceed eight rixdollars a year for each; but they have be|&s;ides a weekly allowance of provi&s;ion. All the of|ficers of the navy are con&s;tantly paid, in peace as well as in war. The Danes are tolerable naviga|tors; but their be&s;t &s;eamen are natives of Norway. There is a good number of fortre&s;&s;es in Denmark kept in repair. The fortifications of Copenhagen are &s;trong and regular, though built of earth. The ca&s;tle of Cronenburg, near El&s;ineur, is of con&s;iderable &s;trength, though irregular. Altena, on the Elbe, is well fortified. Rend&s;burg, that &s;tands on the river Eyder, is a royal fortification, deemed the &s;tronge&s;t place in Denmark. Frede|ricia, in Jutland, is a well fortified town, and a pa&s;s over the Little Belt; and there are &s;everal other &s;trong holds of le&s;s con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The revenues of his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty ari&s;e from the taxes and impo&s;itions laid on his own &s;ubjects, from the duties payed by foreigners, from his own e&s;tate, crown-lands, and confi&s;cations. The taxes are altogether arbitrary, and therefore fluctuating; but they are always grievous to the &s;ubject. They commonly con&s;i&s;t of cu&s;toms or toll for import and export; of exci&s;e upon the con&s;umption of wine, &s;alt, tobacco, eatables, and drinkables; of taxes upon marriages, paper, brewing, grinding, and the exerci&s;e of different profe&s;&s;ions; of impo&s;itions on
<PB N="166" REF="1750">
land, poll-money, ground-rent for all hou&s;es in Copenhagen, and el&s;ewhere; money rai&s;ed for maintaining fortifications, and a portion for the king's daughter, when &s;he happens to be married; but this &s;eldom exceeds one hundred thou&s;and rix|dollars.</P>
<P>One con&s;iderable article in the revenue of Den|mark is the toll payed by foreign &s;hips that pa&s;s through the Sound, or Ore-Sound, into the Baltic. This is a narrow &s;treight between Schonen and the i&s;land of Zealand. At its narrowe&s;t part, on the continent-&s;ide, the town of El&s;ineur and the for|tre&s;s of Cronenburg are &s;ituated: on the &s;ide of Sweden is the town of Hel&s;ingburg; &s;o that the Swedes command both &s;ides of the pa&s;&s;age, and are exempted from the toll which the &s;hips of all other nations pay to the king of Denmark. This was originally no other than a &s;mall contribution, which trading nations agreed to make for main|taining lights at certain places, to direct their cour&s;e through the pa&s;&s;age in dark and &s;tormy wea|ther. At the &s;ame time tho&s;e trading nations agreed that every &s;hip &s;hould pa&s;s this way, and pay its &s;hare of the expence, rather than u&s;e the Great Belt, which is the other pa&s;&s;age, but unpro|vided with &s;uch conveniency. In proce&s;s of time the Danes converted this voluntary contribution into an exorbitant toll, and even exacted arbitrary &s;ums, in proportion to the weakne&s;s of the nation who&s;e &s;hips they vi&s;ited. The&s;e exactions &s;ome|times involved the Danes in quarrels with their neighbours, and the toll was regulated in repeated treaties. The Swedes have freed them&s;elves from this impo&s;ition, which is levied according to cer|tain &s;tipulated rates, in proportion to the &s;ize of the &s;hip and the value of the cargo. The Engli&s;h and Dutch vouch&s;afe to pay it, and other &s;tates
<PB N="167" REF="1760">
trading to the Baltic make no &s;cruple to follow their example. But the Danes know their title to this revenue &s;tands upon a very precarious footing; for, as the Swedes command the pa&s;&s;age, the others have no power to enforce payment; and &s;hould the Maritime Powers di&s;pute their claim to this impo&s;ition, they would &s;oon be obliged to give up the advantage, which has in &s;ome years a|mounted to three hundred thou&s;and rixdollars: at pre&s;ent however the rates are more rea&s;onable, and the whole does not rai&s;e one third of that &s;um. In a word, the whole revenue of Denmark, com|prehending Norway, Iceland, Oldenburg, and Delmenhor&s;t, will not exceed three millions of rix|dollars. Con&s;idering the &s;plendour of the Dani&s;h court, the numerous army, fleet, and fortifications, which this monarch maintains, he would find this income in&s;ufficient to defray his expence, were not his finances managed with oeconomy. The French court, by its in&s;idious arts and unwearied emi&s;|&s;aries, formerly introduced their modes and cu&s;|toms, their language, and their policy, into Den|mark. They &s;oothed and flattered the Dani&s;h kings into extravagant notions of ambition and arbitrary power; &s;educed them into profu&s;ion by a glare of idle pomp and pageantry, and per&s;uaded them to keep on foot &s;uch a &s;tanding army as they could not maintain with their own finances. By the&s;e means they nece&s;&s;arily became needy and de|pendent; and the French, taking advantage of their nece&s;&s;ity, were at hand with the temptation. They offered the &s;ub&s;idy, and the Dane had not power to re&s;i&s;t, even when the conditions of the treaty were unfavourable to the intere&s;t of his kingdom. This, however, is no longer the ca&s;e: the reigning king is altogether independent, and having, by marrying his Britannic maje&s;ty's &s;i&s;ter,
<PB N="168" REF="1770">
entered into clo&s;e connections with England, there can be no doubt but that the ballance of power in the North will be no longer affected by French influence.</P>
<P>The king of Denmark determines all the public affairs of his kingdom, with the advice of a privy|council, compo&s;ed of a few mini&s;ters. There are be|&s;ides four &s;ecretaries of &s;tate; one for the affairs of Denmark, one for Norway, a third for foreign affairs, and a fourth for the regulations and oeco|nomy of war.</P>
<P>To the court of Copenhagen belong two orders of knighthood; namely, that of the Elephant, and that of Danebrug: the badge of the former, which they deem the mo&s;t honourable, is an ele|phant, &s;urmounted with a ca&s;tle, &s;et in diamonds, and &s;u&s;pended to a &s;ky-coloured watered ribbon, worn like the George in England. This order was in&s;tituted by Chri&s;tian I. at his &s;on's wedding, and is conferred only on per&s;ons of the highe&s;t quality and the mo&s;t extraordinary merit: the number of the companions amounts to thirty, be&s;ide the &s;ove|reign. The order of Danebrug is much more antient, &s;o that the origin of it is lo&s;t in fable: it is be&s;towed as an honorary reward upon the noble&s;&s;e of an inferior rank, who have di&s;tin|gui&s;hed them&s;elves in the &s;ervice. Its in&s;ignia con&s;i&s;t of a white ribbon with red edges, worn over the left &s;houlder, from which depends a &s;mall cro&s;s of diamonds, and an embroidered &s;tar on the brea&s;t of the coat, &s;urrounded with the motto <HI>pietate &amp; ju&s;titia.</HI></P>
<P>The court of Denmark generally makes an annual progre&s;s to Sle&s;wick and Hol&s;tein, as well as &s;mall ex|cur&s;ions to different country palaces in the &s;ummer: of the&s;e the mo&s;t remarkable is Frederick&s;burg, about twenty Engli&s;h miles from Copenhagen,
<PB N="169" REF="1780">
&s;ituated in the mid&s;t of a lake, over which are thrown &s;everal draw-bridges. To this belongs a fine park, well planted, and &s;tocked with red deer; but the &s;ituation is cold, moi&s;t, uncomfortable, and unhealthy, and the apartments are very ill|contrived: neverthele&s;s, it is infinitely preferable to the other hou&s;es of the king, who is, upon the whole, wor&s;e lodged than any monarch in Eu|rope.</P>
<P>While the king re&s;ides at this palace, the pa&s;time of the court is &s;tag - hunting; during which diver&s;ion his late maje&s;ty &s;eemed to lay a&s;ide the trappings of royalty, and mingle as an equal with his noblemen and attendants. Even the do|me&s;ticks are indulged with very extraordinary free|doms. About &s;ix in the evening the hunting|a&s;&s;izes are held in the great court before the palace: there the &s;tag is broken up with great ceremony by the hunt&s;men, cloathed in red, having great hunt|ing-horns about their necks, while the hounds at|tend with the mo&s;t clamorous impatience. Pro|clamation is made, that if any per&s;on has that day tran&s;gre&s;&s;ed the laws of hunting, he &s;hould be im|mediately accu&s;ed. Some individual is always &s;e|lected for this purpo&s;e, tried and found guilty. Then he is led by two gentlemen towards the &s;tag, where he fir&s;t kneels down between the horns: he is afterwards obliged to rai&s;e up his po&s;teriors, on which the king him&s;elf, with a long wand, u&s;ed to inflict a certain number of &s;tripes, to the in|finite diver&s;ion of the queen, ladies, and other &s;pectators; while the hounds opened, and the hunt&s;men blew their horns, to proclaim the king's ju&s;tice. The criminal, having undergone this ludicrous cha&s;ti&s;ement, ro&s;e up, and made a pro|found obei&s;ance: then the hounds were permitted to regale upon the &s;tag they had run down. Swan|hunting
<PB N="170" REF="1790">
is another royal diver&s;ion, which the court enjoys in a &s;mall i&s;land near Copenhagen, where tho&s;e birds breed in great numbers. Before the cygnets are &s;ufficiently fledged to take their flight, the king, queen, courtiers, ladies, and foreign mini&s;ters, &s;et out for this i&s;land in a great number of pinnaces, inclo&s;e the haunt of the &s;wans, and with fowling-pieces de&s;troy them by thou&s;ands. The feathers and down belong to the king: the fle&s;h is never eaten.</P>
<P>On Shrove-Tue&s;day the &s;ame great per&s;onages appear in the habit of the boors in North-Hol|land. The men wear great French ho&s;e, blue thrum caps, and &s;hort doublets: the ladies put on blue petticoats, and fanta&s;tic head-dre&s;&s;es. In this garb they embark in waggons for a country-village, called Amak, about three Engli&s;h miles from Copenhagen: there they dance to the &s;ound of bagpipes and fiddles, and eat a country-dinner with wooden &s;poons out of earthen platters. Having pa&s;&s;ed the day in mirth, without any form or ceremony, they return in the &s;ame manner to Copenhagen, where they are treated with a come|dy, and magnificent &s;upper, by &s;ome per&s;on of the fir&s;t quality, and &s;pend the remainder of the night in the &s;ame ru&s;tic manner of dancing.</P>
<P>In the beginning of winter, when the &s;now is &s;ufficiently frozen to bear a carriage, the king and court betake them&s;elves to their &s;leds, drawn by hor&s;es gaily capari&s;oned, and furni&s;hed with a number of &s;mall bells, to give warning of their approach, that the way may be cleared. In the&s;e machines they make &s;everal tours round the city, attended with kettle-drums and trum|pets.</P>
<P>The court has no &s;ooner retired from this di|ver&s;ion than the burghers renew it, and trot about
<PB N="171" REF="1800">
the &s;treets all night long, wrapped up in fur-gowns, each accompanied by his female, whether wife or mi&s;tre&s;s. This, of all others, is the mo&s;t favou|rite diver&s;ion in Denmark.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>POLITICAL INTEREST.</HEAD>
<P>Denmark has not much to hope or to fear from the Empire. Sle&s;wick is a good barrier to her dominions on the continent; and her i&s;lands can|not be invaded without a maritime power. She has di&s;putes with the hou&s;e of Hol&s;tein about the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that dutchy; and as that hou&s;e is now connected with Ru&s;&s;ia, it may be con&s;idered as a more formidable rival than it has hitherto been: but &s;o long as the two northern crowns continue attached to their own intere&s;t, they will be able to ballance the power of that empire in the Baltic; or &s;hould they find them&s;elves unequal to the ta&s;k, they would be &s;upported by England and the States General, which will never &s;it tamely and &s;ee the Ru&s;&s;ian power preponderate in the North. Be&s;ides, in that ca&s;e, the Danes would be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, the elector of Hanover, and other princes who have territories in that part of Germany; princes, who, while they continue &s;teady to their own intere&s;t, will never allow the Ru&s;&s;ians to obtain any footing in the Em|pire.</P>
<P>The late king of Denmark ob&s;erved a &s;crupulous neutrality in the quarrels that di&s;tracted Germany: in keeping aloof at that juncture, he acted as a &s;age politician. He received a &s;ub&s;idy from France, and his &s;ubjects enjoyed particular advantages in trade with that kingdom, as well as in a free commerce to other parts of the world, while that of the nations at war was nece&s;&s;arily interrupted.
<PB N="172" REF="1810">
He found him&s;elf courted by the belligerant powers as an ally, and he acted as a mediator be|tween France and the electorate of Hanover.</P>
<P>With regard to Great Britain, the pre&s;ent king of Denmark, tho' young, &s;eems to enter more than any of his predece&s;&s;ors ever did, into the pur&s;uit of his true intere&s;t; and as his Britannic maje&s;ty di&s;|covers no predilection for Hanover, it is more than probable that means may be found to de&s;troy all ve&s;tiges of the dependence which Denmark former|ly had upon France.</P>

<HEAD>JUTLAND.</HEAD>
<P>HAving treated of the Danes in general, with re&s;pect to their power, policy, commerce, character, and cu&s;toms, we &s;hall now &s;pecify the &s;everal members that compo&s;e the kingdom of Denmark. Its continental territories include Jut|land, Sle&s;wick, and Hol&s;tein: but this la&s;t being a fief held of the Empire, we &s;hall refer it to our de&s;cription of Germany. Jutland, or Jutia Sep|tentrionalis, is bounded on the &s;outh by the dutchy of Sle&s;wick; on the north and we&s;t it is wa&s;hed by the German ocean: its boundaries on the ea&s;t and north-ea&s;t are the Le&s;&s;er Belt, the Baltic, and the Categate. The country is divided into four dio|ce&s;es; namely, Ripen to the &s;outh, Arhu&s;en to the ea&s;t, Aalburg to the north, and Wibourg in the middle. Ripen contains thirty bailiwicks, two hundred and eighty-two pari&s;hes, ten royal palaces, and the &s;even following cities: Ripin, or Ripa, &s;ituated on the river Nip&s;aw, a place of con&s;ider|able
<PB N="173" REF="1820">
trade, governed by two burgo-ma&s;ters and a &s;enate: here are two public &s;chools, a college for divinity, and a public library: Colding, which &s;tands on the banks of the river Aa, a &s;mall town, remarkable for nothing but its bridge; over which all the black cattle and hor&s;es, driven from Jutland to Sle&s;wick, mu&s;t pa&s;s, and pay a toll, which con|&s;titutes a con&s;iderable article in the revenue of his Dani&s;h maje&s;ty: Frederick's-ode, &s;eated on the banks of the Le&s;&s;er Belt, or Middle-fort Sound, a place formerly well fortified; but now the works are in ruins, and indeed the town is of very little importance in any re&s;pect: Weille, a &s;mall, neat, well built city, &s;tanding on a little river about &s;ix miles to the north-we&s;t of Frederick's-ode: Warde, about two and twenty miles from Weille, conve|niently &s;ituated for trade, on a river that falls into the German ocean: Kingcoping, at the di&s;tance of forty-five miles from Ripen, &s;tanding in a bay of the German ocean, and provided with a very &s;afe harbour: Lemwick, in the gulph of Limford; and Ho&s;tlebro, an inland town, of little con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The dioce&s;e of Arhu&s;en comprehends thirty|one bailiwicks, three hundred and four pari&s;hes, five ca&s;tles, and eight fortified towns; of which Aarhus, or Aarhu&s;en, is the capital, &s;tanding near the Categate, at the mouth of the river Gude, an agreeable place, with a commodious harbour, and well &s;upplied with provi&s;ion and ne|ce&s;&s;aries. Six miles higher up the river is Scan|derberg, a &s;trong fortre&s;s. On the &s;ame river is &s;ituated the town of Randers, a place of &s;ome commerce, and famous for the be&s;t &s;almon in Jut|land. Hor&s;ens is a &s;mall town, &s;tanding on the &s;ide of a little gulph that di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Baltic. Ebel&s;tat &s;tands in the bottom of a bay formed by the Categate. Mariager and Hobro are &s;ituated in another bay of the &s;ame Categate;
<PB N="174" REF="1830">
and the Gren&s;tadt is built upon the cape of a penin|&s;ula, that likewi&s;e juts out into this opening.</P>
<P>The dioce&s;e of Wibourg, tho' inland, is not de&s;titute of the conveniency of navigation: the land is inter&s;ected by large branching lakes, which, by means of the gulph of Limford, communi|cate with the Baltic. This dioce&s;e contains &s;ix|teen bailiwicks, two hundred and eighteen pa|ri&s;hes, three garri&s;ons, and three towns. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e is Wibourg, a place of great re&s;ort, on account of its being a &s;eat of ju|dicature, to which appeals are made from inferior tribunals. It continues &s;till to be the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, though he and his chapter are of the Aug&s;burgh confe&s;&s;ion. The town &s;tands near a branch of Limford, is very antient, and was here|tofore called Cimmer&s;burg, as being the chief city of the Cimbri. The other towns of this province are Scheve and Nybe, incon&s;iderable places, that do not merit a particular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The dioce&s;e of Aalburg extends about &s;eventy miles in length, from the &s;outh we&s;t to the far|the&s;t point of the Schager-riff in the north-ea&s;t. It is &s;urrounded by the &s;ea on all &s;ides but the &s;outh, where it is divided from Wibourg and Ripen by the gulph of Limford, running from the Baltic fifty miles a cro&s;s the country. This di&s;|trict is naturally fertile, and the inhabitants carry on a con&s;iderable commerce. It comprehends thirteen bailiwicks, one hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even pari&s;hes, and &s;ome towns of note. Aalburg &s;tands on the gulph of Limford and is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop. Wen&s;u&s;zel, formerly Burglaw, is &s;ituated on the river Ryaa. Schagen, &s;eated on the cape to which it lends its name, though formerly called Cimbro|rum Promontorium, is frequented by merchants from all parts of Europe, who touch at this place in their way to the Sound. Nikropingis, a con&s;i|derable

town, built on the i&s;le of Mors, formed by the gulph of Limford. Ty&s;ted, &s;tanding in the middle of an i&s;thmus, made by that gulph and the German ocean, is noted for nothing but a mean univer&s;ity, founded by Chri&s;tiern III. king of Denmark. Seeby is a &s;mall &s;ea-port town on the ea&s;tern &s;hore. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable i&s;lands belonging to Jutland, are Le&s;&s;ow and Sam&s;oe, to|lerably fertile, and pretty well peopled by hunters and fi&s;hermen.</P>

<HEAD>SLESWICK.</HEAD>
<P>THE duchy of Sel&s;wick was once partly &s;ubjected to the duke of Hol&s;tein-Gottorp, from who&s;e hou&s;e the reigning family of Denmark is de&s;cended; but now the Dane po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the whole. The length of Sel&s;wick amounts to about eighty-&s;ix miles, the breadth to three&s;core. It is bounded by Jutland, the Baltic, the dutchy of Hol&s;tein, and the German ocean. It is well watered by ri|vers, which fertilize the &s;oil, in&s;omuch that it pro|duces corn in great plenty. It is divided into the four circles of Hader&s;leben, Tonderen, Flen&s;burg, and Gottorp. The nobility are rich, and the com|mon people independent. The capital city, Sel&s;|wick, &s;eated on a &s;mall arm of the &s;ea, called the Sley, was formerly very con&s;iderable, opulent, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop. At pre&s;ent the trade is de|cayed; yet the town is well &s;upplied with nece&s;&s;a|ries from the neighbouring country, which is re|markably fruitful.</P>

At the di&s;tance of a few miles from this city, appear the ruins of the famous wall, or rampart, called Danewark; which the Danes, in antient times, built from &s;ea to &s;ea, as a bulwark again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Saxons.</P>
<P>Gottorp, which likewi&s;e &s;tands upon the Sley, is famous for the palace belonging to the dukes of Hol&s;tein. This edifice is built in the middle of a &s;mall lake, in form of an oblong &s;quare, fortified with four earthen ba&s;tions. The magnificence of the building, the long bridge thrown over the lake, the garden diver&s;ified and adorned with terra&s;&s;es, walks, arbours, parterres, orangeries, nur&s;eries, &s;tatues, &s;ummer-hou&s;es, fi&s;h-ponds, ba&s;ons, water|works and ca&s;cades, render it by far the mo&s;t noble and delightful habitation in the northern part of Europe. In one of the &s;ummer-hou&s;es, we &s;ee a globe, con&s;tructed by the celebrated Tycho-Brahe, contrived to repre&s;ent his planetary &s;y&s;tem. Here likewi&s;e is a copper-globe, ten feet and an half in diameter, with a &s;phere exhibiting the &s;un moving in the ecliptic, and all the heavenly bodies re|volving by means of certain wheels, which are turned with water conveyed from the nighbour|ing mountain. Adjoining to the garden is a fine park, or fore&s;t, laid out in plea&s;ant walks and openings, and abounding with fallow deer, wild boars, and every &s;pecies of the game.</P>

<P>Hu&s;um, on the gulph of Hover, at the di&s;tance of ten miles from Tonningen, was formerly rich and flouri&s;hing; but now the town is quite decayed, having &s;uffered grievou&s;ly by conflagration, war, and inundation.</P>

<P>To Sle&s;wick belong &s;everal i&s;lands, both in the Ocean and in the Baltic. Of the former the chief was North&s;trand, oppo&s;ite to the town of Hu&s;um, and &s;aid to have been &s;eparated from the continent by a violent &s;torm. The length of it extended to twelve miles, and the breadth to four in &s;ome places. The &s;oil was fruitful, both in pa&s;ture and corn. The number of inhabitants amounted to eight thou&s;and, divided into one and twenty pa|ri&s;hes. They bred a con&s;iderable number of black cattle, &s;heep, and poultry, and made great quan|tities of butter: but the i&s;land has been ruined by repeated inundations. In the year 1300, &s;everal churches and villages, with a great number of people and cattle, were de&s;troyed. In 1532, the whole i&s;land was overflowed, and nineteen hundred per&s;ons peri&s;hed. In 1615, three hundred men, women, and children, were drowned. In 1634, the whole i&s;land was laid under water, and above &s;ix thou&s;and per&s;ons lo&s;t their lives: fifty thou&s;and head of cattle peri&s;hed, and the dykes were broken in four and forty different places: of all the inha|bitants fifteen hundred only were &s;aved, with diffi|culty.

<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e, which lies over-again&s;t the towns of Flen&s;burg and Apenrade, extends four|teen miles in length from north to &s;outh, and near twelve in breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t. It is fertile and populous, containing, be&s;ides &s;everal villages, two con&s;iderable towns, called Sunderburg and Northburg. The&s;e have given titles to two branches of the Hol&s;tein family. Sunderburg, which &s;tands at the &s;outhern end of the i&s;land, where the duke of that name re&s;ided, is a hand|&s;ome town, &s;ecured by a &s;tately ca&s;tle. The place is &s;o &s;trong as to have been able to &s;u&s;tain the at|tack of an army under general Wrange, who met with &s;uch a warm reception, that he thought pro|per to abandon the i&s;land. The duke of North|burg re&s;ided at the town of that name, &s;ituated in the northern part, which was built in the twelfth century by king Sweno, &s;urnamed Gratten-hode, or Great Head.</P>
<P>Arroe is a very &s;mall i&s;land, lying in the Le&s;&s;er Belt, between Funen and the coa&s;t of Sle&s;wick: there is another of the &s;ame name, that properly belongs to Denmark.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="1890">
The principal i&s;lands that compo&s;e this king|dom it will be nece&s;&s;ary to particularize.</P>
<P>Zealand, which is by far the mo&s;t fertile and exten&s;ive i&s;land in the Baltic, is bounded on the ea&s;t by the Sound, which divides it from Schonen; on the we&s;t by the Greater Belt, that &s;eparates it from Funen: the i&s;lands of Moon, Fal&s;ter, and Laland, lie to the &s;outh; and on the north are the Categate and Schager-rack. It &s;tretches &s;ixty-eight miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and its breadth may amount to &s;ixty. The land is generally flat, and exceedingly fertile; and its woods and fore&s;ts abound with game. The coa&s;t is indented by gulphs, bays, and inlets, affording commodious harbours, by means of which a con&s;iderable trade might be carried on by the natives: but they are, for the mo&s;t part, dull, di&s;pirited, and inactive. Zealand is divided into &s;ix and twenty bailiwicks, called herrits: the&s;e contain three hundred and forty-&s;ix pari&s;hes, and &s;everal con&s;iderable cities, of which Copenhagen is the capital. It lies very low, in a round form, which is chiefly owing to a circuit of fortifications; and contains about five and thirty thou&s;and inhabitants. The hou&s;es were formerly of wood; but in the year 1728 the whole city was reduced to a&s;hes, and &s;ince that time it has been rebuilt of brick and free&s;tone. The late king expended con&s;iderable &s;ums in rai&s;ing a &s;u|perb palace; and the town is adorned with elegant hou&s;es belonging to the nobility, magnificent churches, and &s;umptuous public edifices. The harbour, which we reckon one of the be&s;t in the known world, is &s;ecured by the i&s;le of Amack, that breaks off the waves, and &s;helters it from the &s;urge of the &s;ea. Here &s;tand the ar&s;enal, the mint, the exchange, and the ca&s;tle, with about five hun|dred hou&s;es, known by the name of the new town. It is &s;eparated from Zealand by a canal, over which
<PB N="181" REF="1900">
they have thrown &s;everal bridges, that afford an ea&s;y communication, without ob&s;tructing the pa&s;|&s;age of the &s;hips in their ingre&s;s or egre&s;s. The entrance to the harbour is &s;o narrow as to deny ad|mittance to more than one &s;hip at a time; and this pa&s;&s;age is &s;ecured every night with a &s;trong boom: the mouth of it is commanded by the citadel on one &s;ide, and a block-hou&s;e on the other, well fur|ni&s;hed with artillery. Five hundred &s;ail of &s;hips may ride at ea&s;e in the harbour, &s;ecure alike from the weather and the enemy. Here the royal navy of Denmark may be &s;een, each &s;hip riding in its proper berth or &s;tation; and, round the whole in|clo&s;ure, a wooden gallery projects over the water. The external road affords good anchorage, being fenced from the &s;ea by a large &s;and-bank, the &s;hal|lows of which are di&s;tingui&s;hed by two floating buoys.</P>
<P>The i&s;land of Amack, or Amagar, lies ea&s;t from the city, on the other &s;ide of the harbour, about &s;ix miles in length, and of an oval form. It was chiefly planted by Hollanders, &s;ent thither by Margaret dutche&s;s of Savoy, while &s;he acted as governe&s;s of the Low Countries. Chri&s;tern II. e&s;pou&s;ed her niece, who was &s;i&s;ter to the emperor Charles V. and that this lady might have plenty of pul&s;e and kitchen-herbs, which were but little known in Denmark, her aunt &s;upplied her with a little colony of Hollan|ders, to whom half the i&s;land was granted, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Holland&s;by. Their po&s;terity &s;till retain the language and the cu&s;toms of the Dutch. They &s;upply Copenhagen with milk, chee&s;e, and butter: they are an indu&s;trious &s;et of people, and their hou&s;es are neat and com|modious. Be&s;ides pul&s;e and wheat, this i&s;land produces barley, oats, and hares in abundance.</P>

and particularly defended by the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Cronenburg, which commands one &s;ide of the Sound. This ca&s;tle, which is now fallen to decay, was formerly very &s;trong, &s;pacious, and magnifi|cent, built by Frederick II. at his own expence; that is, from his own private revenue, without the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of his &s;ubjects.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to Hel&s;ineur appears the i&s;land of Huen, ri&s;ing like a hill in the middle of the &s;ea, and commanding a pro&s;pect over all the neigh|bouring country. It was upon this i&s;land that the famous Tycho Brahe built the ca&s;tle of Uraniburg, and his ob&s;ervatory. Frederick II. be&s;towed upon him the i&s;land for life, as a commodious &s;pot for this purpo&s;e, the air being generally free from fogs, and the &s;ky perfectly &s;erene. Uraniburg was fini&s;hed in four years, &s;o as to be deemed the mo&s;t curious edifice in the world. He afterwards built another hou&s;e on the &s;outhern part of the i&s;land, and conferred upon it the appellation of Stelburg. Both the&s;e &s;tructures were compleatly provided with all the in&s;truments and apparatus nece&s;&s;ary in the different re&s;earches of a&s;tronomy, chymi&s;try, and natural philo&s;ophy; and he was en|abled to defray the expence by a pen&s;ion of two thou&s;and golden crowns, a con&s;iderable fief in Nor|way, and a prebend in the church of Ro&s;child. Uraniburg is now decayed, and the i&s;land belongs to the Swedes.</P>

<P>Ro&s;child, which was formerly the capital, &s;tands at the bottom of the bay of I&s;efiord, about eigh|teen miles to the we&s;tward of Copenhagen. Since the kings of Denmark have removed their re&s;i|dence from this place, it has dwindled greatly in wealth, commerce, and importance. Of twenty|&s;even churches that formerly adorned this town, two only are now &s;tanding: it continues, however, to be the burying-place of the royal family. Among the tombs of the Dani&s;h kings, &s;ome of which are very magnificent, &s;tands a fair marble pillar, erected by queen Margaret, as a &s;upport to the whet&s;tone &s;ent to her by Albert king of Swe|den to &s;harpen her needles, in deri&s;ion of her &s;ex. He &s;uffered &s;everely for this &s;arca&s;m: he was taken pri&s;oner by the queen, detained &s;even years in cu&s;|tody, and obliged to relinqui&s;h all his preten&s;ions to the crown of Sweden. Here is a convent of Lutheran nuns, belonging to the be&s;t families: they wear no particular habit, are re&s;tricted by no vows, and, when a good match offers, may leave the cloi&s;ter and marry. The college of the univer|&s;ity is by no means in a flouri&s;hing condition, and the whole town exhibits evident marks of poverty and decay. It was here that, in the year 1658, the famous treaty of peace was concluded between Denmark and Sweden.</P>

Hither Frederick removed his academy from Frederick&s;burg, and the foundations of the uni|ver&s;ity were augmented by his &s;on Chri&s;tiern IV. The celebrated Meur&s;ius was profe&s;&s;or of hi&s;tory and politics in the college of Sora, where he died, and lies buried. Charles-Gu&s;tavus king of Swe|den was here educated, and retained &s;uch venera|tion for the place, that when he invaded Zealand he would not &s;uffer his &s;oldiers to enter the town. The revenues of this academy have &s;ince been an|nexed to the crown of Denmark, and the place is almo&s;t wholly unknown.</P>

<HEAD>ITS SITUATION, EXTENT, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we may leave nothing behind us, we &s;hall now proceed to the de&s;cription of Lapland; the whole of which, extending from the North Cape in 71 degr. 30&Prime;'; of northern latitude to the White Sea, under the Artic Circle, is inhabited by the &s;ame people, though different parts of the country are &s;ubject to different powers. Norwe|gian Lapland, under the dominion of the Dane, included in the government of Wardhus, which we have already de&s;cribed, lies between the northern &s;ea, the river Pais, and the lake Enarak. Swedi&s;h Lapland, comprehending all the country from the Baltic to the mountains that &s;eparate Norway from Sweden, is divided into &s;ix di&s;tricts, denominated Marck, or Territory; and the&s;e are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of rivers, &s;uch as Aungner-man|land, Uma, Peta, Lula, Torna, and Kiemi. The ea&s;tern part, &s;ubject to the czar of Mu&s;covy, &s;ituated between the lake Enarak and the White Sea, is divided into three di&s;tinct prefectures; namely, that of the &s;ea-coa&s;t, towards the north, called Mourmankoi Leporie, in which is the port of Kola, well known to the European navigators; the Ter&s;koi Leporie, upon the coa&s;t of the White
<PB N="190" REF="2010">
Sea; and the third or inland, known by the name of Bellamore&s;koi Leporie. In Swedi&s;h Lapland, which is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the three, the provinces or marcks are &s;ubdivided into &s;maller di&s;|tricts, called Biars, con&s;i&s;ting each of a certain number of families; among which the land is par|celled out by the government, or prefect of the di&s;trict, appointed by the king of Sweden. This di&s;mal country is but thinly inhabited by a wretched people, &s;aid to have been originally natives of Fin|land, from whence they were driven into the&s;e de|&s;arts. Hence they derived the name of Lappes, which, in the Finland language, &s;ignifies exiles; but this appellation they reject as a reproach, and call them&s;elves <HI>Sabmienlanti.</HI></P>

<HEAD>MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>Lapland may be termed a huge congeries of frightful rocks and &s;tupendous mountains; among which the winter &s;eems to rage with redoubled and uncea&s;ing fury, in fro&s;t and &s;now, and &s;torm and whirlwind: yet inter&s;per&s;ed among the&s;e dreadful mountains are many plea&s;ant vallies, watered by an infinite number of rivulets, that run into the rivers and lakes, which di&s;charge them&s;elves into the gulph of Bothnia. The principal rivers we have already named: the particular lakes &s;hall be men|tioned in the de&s;cription of the &s;everal di&s;tricts. Suffice it to &s;ay, that the chief among them are the&s;e, the Great Uma, the Great Windel, the Orea|van, the Stor-awan, the Great Lula; the lakes of Kartom, Kali, Torno, Enara, and Kimi. Some of the&s;e extend &s;ixty leagues in length, and con|tain a great number of i&s;lands: three hundred and &s;ixty-five are &s;aid to be contained in the lake Stor|awan; and Enara forms an archipelago of i&s;lands &s;o large, that no Laplander has lived long enough
<PB N="191" REF="2020">
to vi&s;it each particular i&s;land. The natives believe this country to be the terre&s;trial paradi&s;e; and in|deed nothing could be more inchanting than &s;uch va&s;t and agreeable pro&s;pects of mountains, hills, fore&s;ts, lakes, rivers, and rivulets, if the country was &s;ituated in a moderate climate: yet even here, in &s;ummer, the ro&s;es are &s;een blowing wild on the banks of the lakes and rivers, with all the vermi|lion glow that appears in tho&s;e which are cultivated in our gardens. But all the intervals between the mountains are not engro&s;&s;ed by the&s;e agreeable rivulets, rivers, lakes, and vallies: great part of the flat country is covered with brown du&s;ky fore&s;ts of fur and pine-tree; and the&s;e are often &s;kirted by wide extended mora&s;&s;es, the &s;tagnating water of which putrefies in the &s;ummer, and produces myriads of mi&s;chievous in&s;ects, that are much more intolerable than the cold of winter.</P>
<P>In winter the lips are often frozen to the cup, when a man attempts to drink; and even brandy can &s;carce be pre&s;erved in a &s;tate of fluidity. The mercury in Reaumur's thermometer &s;inks to 37 degrees below the freezing point; though in the mo&s;t inten&s;e fro&s;t, ever known in Paris, it did not de&s;cend above fourteen. The &s;pirit of wine in other thermometers is converted into ice. The very breath freezes in expiration; and the limbs of people are very often mortified, and peri&s;h. All the lakes and rivers are frozen to a prodigious thickne&s;s; and the whole face of the country is covered with &s;now to the depth of four or five feet: while this continues loo&s;e, it is impo&s;&s;ible to travel; for a man's eyes are not only blinded with it, but, if a &s;trong wind &s;hould ri&s;e, he will be buried in the drifts of &s;now: yet, &s;hould a partial thaw take place for a few hours, the &s;urface of this &s;now is formed by the &s;ucceeding fro&s;t into a hard impe|netrable cru&s;t, over which the Laplander travels in
<PB N="192" REF="2030">
his &s;ledge with amazing rapidity. While the thaw prevails the air is &s;urcharged with vapours, and the climate is rainy; but while the north wind blows the &s;ky is beautifully &s;erene, and exhibits the mo&s;t gorgeous appearance.</P>

<P>This being the mo&s;t northern country on the continent of Europe, the cold mu&s;t be extreme in the winter; but the rigour of the winter is not more &s;evere than the heats of &s;ummer are exce&s;&s;ive. At the northern extremity, the &s;un in &s;ummer never &s;ets for three months; and in winter there is an uninterrupted night of the &s;ame duration: but this is qualified in &s;uch a manner, by a con&s;tant re|volution of dawn and twilight, by a &s;erene &s;ky, moon-light, and <HI>aurora borealis,</HI> reflected from the white &s;urface of the earth covered with &s;now, that the inhabitants are enabled to hunt, fi&s;h, and pro|ceed with their ordinary occupations. The coun|try abounds with excellent &s;prings, and is remark|able for &s;ome &s;urpri&s;ing cataracts, in which the water rumbles over frightful precipices, and da&s;hes among rocks with amazing impetuo&s;ity and tre|mendous noi&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, and VEGETABLES.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;oil of Lapland is generally &s;o chilled and barren, that it produces little or no &s;ort of grain, nor fruit-trees of any kind: this &s;terility, however, is not &s;o much owing to the &s;oil, which is in many places of a rich mould, as to want of indu&s;try; for, in &s;ome di&s;tricts, the Swedes have tilled and manured pieces of ground, that bear plentiful crops of rye. There is al&s;o great plenty of ber|ries, &s;uch as black currants, what is called the Nor|wegian mulberry, growing upon a creeping plant,
<PB N="193" REF="2040">
and much e&s;teemed as an anti&s;corbutick; ra&s;p|berries, cranberries, juniperberries, and bilberries. The juniper-tree ri&s;es to a great height in this country. The tops of the mountains are &s;o much expo&s;ed to inten&s;e cold, and tempe&s;ts of &s;now and hail, that no tree will grow near the &s;ummit: but in parts that are more &s;heltered, we &s;ee fine woods of birch, pine, and fur, di&s;po&s;ed by nature as if they had been planted by art in rows at regular di&s;tances, without any under-growth or incum|brance below. Be&s;ides the&s;e trees, &s;ome parts of Lapland produce the &s;ervice-tree, the willow, the poplar, the elder, and the corneil. Among the plants of this country the principal is the angelica, greatly e&s;teemed by the natives, who u&s;e it in their food. Here is likewi&s;e the aceto&s;a, or &s;orrel, in great plenty, and much u&s;ed by the Laplanders. They have al&s;o other herbs peculiar to them&s;elves, different kinds of gra&s;s, heath, and fern: the&s;e are all enumerated in a work of the celebrated Linnaeus, intituled <HI>Flora Laponica.</HI> But the ve|getable which is in the greate&s;t plenty, and mo&s;t exten&s;ive u&s;e among them, is the mo&s;chus, or mo&s;s; of which &s;pecies there are many different genera, either adhering to trees, or growing on the &s;urface of the earth. The rein-deer is almo&s;t wholly &s;u&s;tained by this vegetable, which indeed he prefers to all others, and without which he can|not &s;ub&s;i&s;t. The Laplanders not only u&s;e it as forage to their cattle, but boil it in broth, as a cordial and re&s;torative. They likewi&s;e u&s;e one &s;ort of it as a &s;oft, ea&s;y, and whol&s;ome bed to their new-born children.</P>

<HEAD>METALS and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>Some &s;ilver and lead mines have been di&s;co|vered in the provinces of Pitha and Lula; and two of copper, together with excellent veins of
<PB N="194" REF="2050">
iron, in the di&s;trict of Torna: but they are not at pre&s;ent worked to any con&s;iderable advantage. At Sltangliware, in the march or di&s;trict of Torno, there is a vein of gold and &s;ilver mixed; another of lead and &s;ilver at Keck&s;ca&s;ware, in the &s;ame di|vi&s;ion; a third of copper at Swappaware, in this di&s;trict al&s;o. They have rai&s;ed another copper|work at Wordnacka, in the province of Lula: they dig for iron at Gelliware in this di&s;trict, and at Jo|nu&s;vando in Torno, where there is a foundery. The &s;ilver found in the mines of Na&s;afraell, in Pita, is &s;melted in the foundery of Silbojock; and that which they dig at Kendkeware, in the di&s;trict of Lula, is refined in the furnaces at Queckjock. But the&s;e mines are worked only for a few months in the &s;ummer, becau&s;e the fro&s;t hinders the en|gines from playing.</P>
<P>Here are found beautiful chry&s;tals, of a &s;ur|pri&s;ing magnitude, &s;o hard and fine, that, when poli&s;hed, they re&s;emble real diamonds. One, as large as a child's head, was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the count Gabriel de la Gardre, at one time chancellor of Sweden. Lapland al&s;o affords amethy&s;ts and topazes, but pale and cloudy; and a great quan|tity of very curious &s;tones, which are too hard to be worked by the tool of the ma&s;on. Some of the&s;e, found on the banks of rivers and lakes, when they happen to bear the lea&s;t re&s;emblance to the figures of animals, the Laplanders remove to more con&s;picuous places, and adore as deities. The province of Torno affords &s;ome curious mi|neral &s;tones, of an octagonal &s;hape, regular, &s;hin|ing, and poli&s;hed by the hand of Nature. In &s;ome rivers they fi&s;h for pearls, which are generally pale; but &s;ome of them are as bright as the oriental pearls, and much larger and rounder. Scheffer tells us, that a lapidary &s;old one of the&s;e to a lady of Stockholm for one hundred and twenty crowns;
<PB N="195" REF="2060">
and prote&s;ted, that if he had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed another to match it, he would not have parted with the two for le&s;s than five hundred. The Lapland pearls are found in mu&s;cle-&s;hells, and the fi&s;hery is not in the &s;ea, but in rivers.</P>

<HEAD>ANIMALS, QUADRUPEDS, BIRDS, FISHES, and INSECTS.</HEAD>
<P>Lapland, in common with Norway, is infe&s;ted by a great number of grey wolves and bears, with which the inhabitants are at perpetual war. The mo&s;t honourable exploit among the Laplanders is that of killing a bear, and the heroes adorn their caps with a &s;mall plate of lead or pewter for every bear they have &s;lain. The country abounds with elks, beavers, and otters, which live here unmo|le&s;ted, and find plenty of fi&s;h for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Among other bea&s;ts it likewi&s;e produces the glut|ton, which we have de&s;cribed in our account of Norway. The black foxes of Lapland are in &s;uch e&s;timation for their furs, that one &s;kin will &s;ell for twelve golden crowns at Mo&s;cow. The fore&s;ts of Lapland furni&s;h haunts to a great number of beau|tiful martens and &s;quirrels; which la&s;t change their colour every winter, from brown to grey. The&s;e animals frequently migrate in troops innumerable. When they arrive at the &s;ide of a lake, they em|bark upon pieces of bark or timber, which they find afloat, and are generally drowned in their pa&s;|&s;age: the bodies, in&s;tead of &s;inking, are ca&s;t a&s;hore, and the &s;kin becomes a prize to the fir&s;t finder. What &s;hould induce the&s;e animals to quit the country, and undertake &s;uch a hazardous voyage, has not yet been di&s;covered.</P>
<P>Lapland is al&s;o the native country of the zibel|ing, a creature re&s;embling the marten, who&s;e &s;kin, whether black or white, if glo&s;&s;y, is extremely valuable, and often given in pre&s;ents by the am|ba&s;&s;adors
<PB N="196" REF="2070">
of Mu&s;covy to the princes at who&s;e courts they re&s;ide. Here are likewi&s;e ermins, weazels, hares, which are &s;aid to grow white in the winter; large black cats, which attend the Laplanders in hunting, and little prick-eared curs, trained to the game. But the mo&s;t remarkable animal of Lap|land is the rein-deer, which we have already de|&s;cribed in the article of Norway: he is larger and &s;tronger than a &s;tag, and naturally wild; but the Laplanders find means to tame and convert him into a bea&s;t of burthen.</P>
<P>The woods, mountains, and rivers, are well &s;tocked with wild fowl; &s;uch as bu&s;tard, partridge, grow&s;e, heathcock, phea&s;ants, lapwings, &s;wans, wild gee&s;e, wild ducks, including the lumme, or northern diver, and all &s;orts of aquatic birds that build and breed in northern climates. In the be|ginning of the &s;pring the &s;wans go thither in numerous flights from the German ocean: the lapwings follow in &s;uch &s;warms, that they darken the day as they pa&s;s along, and &s;cream &s;o loud, that they may be heard at a league's di&s;tance. The rocks and mountains are likewi&s;e frequented by eagles, hawks, faulcons, kites, and other birds of prey.</P>
<P>The rivers and lakes of Lapland abound with delicious &s;almon from the gulph of Bothnia, trout, bream, and perch, of exqui&s;ite flavour and amazing magnitude. The Laplanders of Wardhus are well &s;upplied with &s;ea-fi&s;h from the northern ocean.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to in&s;ects, the &s;lies hatched in the mora&s;&s;es and woods in &s;ummer are &s;o numerous, that they often ob&s;cure the face of day; &s;o venom|ous, trouble&s;ome, and intolerable, that the rein|deer fly to the tops of the highe&s;t mountains for &s;helter; and the Laplanders betake them&s;elves to the &s;ea-&s;ide, which is the lea&s;t infe&s;ted by the&s;e pe&s;tilent vermin. The celebrated M. de Mauper|tuis, in his account of the voyage he made to Lap|land,
<PB N="197" REF="2080">
in company with the other mathematicians, &s;ent thither by the French king to mea&s;ure a de|gree of the meridian, gives us to under&s;tand, that on the tops of the mountains in Torno the flies were &s;o trouble&s;ome, that even the Finland &s;ol|diers, who are counted the mo&s;t hardy troops in the &s;ervice of Sweden, were obliged to cover their faces with the &s;kirts of their coats, from the attacks of the&s;e animals; which &s;warmed to &s;uch a degree, that the moment a piece of fle&s;h appeared it was blackened all over. Some of the&s;e flies are very large, with green heads, and fetch blood from the &s;kin whenever they &s;trike. The Laplanders &s;hroud them&s;elves in the impenetrable &s;moke of a large fire, kindled for that purpo&s;e: yet even this di&s;|agreeable expedient was not &s;ufficient to defend the French philo&s;ophers: they were obliged, notwith|&s;tanding the exce&s;&s;ive heat, to wrap up their heads in garments made of the &s;kins of rein-deer, called in that country <HI>lapmudes,</HI> and to cover them&s;elves with a thick rampart of fir-boughs: yet all the&s;e precautions proved ineffectual. M. de Mauper|tuis ob&s;erved a large lake quite covered with little yellowi&s;h grains, re&s;embling millet-&s;eed, which he &s;uppo&s;ed to be the chry&s;ali&s;es of &s;ome of the&s;e in&s;ects.</P>

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their LANGUAGE, RELIGION LAWS, and GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>We have already ob&s;erved that the Laplanders were expelled from Finland; but whence their language is derived, we cannot &s;o ea&s;ily determine. Scheffer is of opinion, that it is the &s;ame with that &s;poken by the Finlanders, and gives a catalogue of words that have the &s;ame &s;ignification among both the&s;e nations: but this argument is altogether in|conclu&s;ive, ina&s;much as the &s;ame analogy might be found among all the languages of Europe and
<PB N="198" REF="2090">
A&s;ia. Be&s;ides, it is not at all likely that the Lap|landers &s;hould u&s;e the &s;ame language that was &s;poken by their conquerors, who came from an|other country. Be that circum&s;tance as it may, certain it is the Laplanders &s;peak a very barbarous tongue, which varies in different parts of the coun|try, according to the corre&s;pondence which the natives maintain with different nations; &s;uch as the Norwegians, Swedes, Finlanders, and Mu&s;covites. They are, generally &s;peaking, totally ignorant of letters; and, we may &s;ay, of arts, except &s;uch as nece&s;&s;ity has taught them for their own pre&s;er|vation.</P>
<P>In the la&s;t century the people of Lapland were converted to chri&s;tianity, by mi&s;&s;ionaries from Nor|way, Sweden, and Mu&s;covy. Several churches were built in different parts of the country, and &s;upplied with mini&s;ters chiefly from Sweden. A public &s;chool was in&s;tituted in the town of Pitha, to in&s;truct the children of the Laplanders in the chri&s;tian religion, and in letters; and the ma&s;ters tran&s;lated &s;ome Swedi&s;h books into the language of this country; &s;uch as the Catechi&s;m, with &s;ome prayers, and the Manual, containing the p&s;alms of David, the Evangeli&s;ts, the proverbs of Solomon, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The king of Sweden founded another col|lege of this &s;ame kind at Lik&s;ala, in the province of Uma: but, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e endea|vours, the majority of the Laplanders adhere to their ancient idolatry: even tho&s;e who profe&s;s the chri&s;tian religion, have blended it &s;trangely with their old heatheni&s;h rites, and &s;till retain all their former &s;uper&s;tition. They are great ob&s;ervers of times, &s;ea&s;ons, and omens; and di&s;tingui&s;h a great number of days into black and white, that is, lucky or unfortunate. The day after Chri&s;t|mas, the fe&s;tivals of St. Catherine, St. Clement, and St. Mark, they deem unlucky. The wor&s;hip
<PB N="199" REF="2100">
of the true God they have mingled with the rites of adoration offered to imaginary deities. They believe in a good and evil principle, which they &s;uppo&s;e to be at continual variance; and which, according to the prevalence of either, are produc|tive of happine&s;s or mi&s;ery to mankind. They likewi&s;e adore the gods Thor, Storjunkare, and Bacwe, which la&s;t is the &s;un; and the&s;e they wor|&s;hip in the figures of &s;tones, trunks, and fire. They likewi&s;e pay great reverence to the manes, or &s;pirits of their departed friends; and dread them extremely, in the belief that they delight in mi&s;|chief, until they reanimate other bodies. Thus they maintain the doctrine of the metemp&s;ycho&s;is, or tran&s;migration of &s;ouls. They likewi&s;e pay their offerings and &s;upplications to certain daemons, &s;uppo&s;ed to frequent the mountains and lakes, as well as to other genii, called Juhles, that inhabit the air, and are thought to have the power to do either good or evil, e&s;pecially at the time of the Chri&s;tmas-holidays: of the&s;e the Laplander has neither image nor &s;tatue; but offers &s;acrifice to them at the root of &s;ome tree. They fa&s;t on Chri&s;tmas-eve, which they call the fea&s;t of Juhles. They &s;et apart a portion of their victuals next day, when they have extraordinary chear, in order to be offered as a &s;acrifice. Two days after the fe&s;tival they put this portion into a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el, made of birch-bark in the form of a &s;hip, with &s;ails and oars. This they carry to a tree near the hut, and, after &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious ceremonies, hang up on a bough, for the u&s;e of the Juhles that traver&s;e the air, the fore&s;ts, and the mountains. Sacrifices of the &s;ame nature they offer to the manes, or dead, which they di&s;tingui&s;h by the appellation of <HI>Sittes.</HI> They have implicit faith in magic and divination, and pretend to progno&s;ticate events by means of
<PB N="200" REF="2110">
figures drawn upon drums <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The drum is made of the hollowed trunk of a fir, pine, or birch-tree, one end of which is covered with a &s;kin: on this they draw, with a kind of red colour, the figures of their own gods, as well as of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, the apo&s;tles, the &s;un, moon, &s;tars, birds, bears, and rivers. On the&s;e they place one or two bra&s;s rings, which, when the drum is beaten with a little hammer, dance over the fi|gures, and according to their progre&s;s the &s;orcerer progno&s;|ticates.</NOTE>, made for that pur|po&s;e: nay, tho&s;e that live upon the Ocean, and the banks of the White Sea, are bold enough to drive a traffick in winds, with &s;uch &s;hip-ma&s;ters as are &s;o credulous to go to market for this commodity. When a &s;hip is wind-bound at Wardhus, or Kiemi, and the pilot has faith in the&s;e incantations, he ad|dre&s;&s;es him&s;elf to a Lapland wizard; who, for a rea&s;onable con&s;ideration, pre&s;ents him with a magic cord, on which are a certain number of knots, to be untied occa&s;ionally, as the wind may happen to fail about certain capes, or promontories. This impo&s;ition, however, is too gro&s;s to be &s;wallowed by any per&s;on who&s;e faculties are not wholly ob|&s;cured with ignorance and &s;uper&s;tition. The pre|tended diviner u&s;ed to chaffer and di&s;pute about the price, until he perceived certain &s;igns in the atmo&s;phere, which always foretold an alteration of weather: then he made ha&s;te to conclude his bar|gain, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the captain with his knotted tali&s;man, leaving the completion of his prophecy to accident.</P>
<P>Lapland is &s;o far from being populous, that the whole nation is not equal in number to one petty province in France. The Laplanders are very low in &s;tature <NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Generally about a head &s;horter than other Europeans. They are likewi&s;e remarkable for having large heads. M. de Maupertuis mea&s;ured a female Laplander, who &s;uckled her own child; and found her &s;ta|ture did not exceed four feet two inches and five lines.</NOTE>, ill-&s;haped, and ugly; yet &s;trong, hardy,

and robu&s;t, in&s;omuch that they will bear incredible fatigue; and it is remarked that the &s;toute&s;t Nor|wegian is not able to bend the bow of a Laplander. The women, however, are much le&s;s homely than the men, and many of them are noted for a deli|cate and florid complexion. In all probability they are &s;tunted in their growth by the extreme cold, and the wretched nouri&s;hment on which they &s;ub&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>But, before we proceed to de&s;cribe their manners and cu&s;toms, it will be proper to take &s;ome notice of the nature of their government. The Laplanders are governed, in different parts, by prefects or governors, &s;ent from the three powers to which they are &s;ubject. In Swedi&s;h Lap|land, which is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, the laws of that kingdom are ob&s;erved. There is a tribunal, or court of ju&s;tice, e&s;tabli&s;hed for Angermand-Lapmark; a &s;econd for Uma, Pitha, and Lula-Lapmark; and a third for Torno, and Kiemi-Lapmark. In each of the&s;e a prefect pre&s;ides, and the prie&s;t is his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. The&s;e judges, how|ever, have &s;eldom an opportunity to exert their judicial power; for theft, robbery, murder, and adultery, are crimes almo&s;t utterly unknown among tho&s;e people, who are equally ignorant of letters and of vice. They &s;eldom tran&s;gre&s;s the law, ex|cept in the practice of &s;orcery, which is prohibited on pain of death; yet, notwith&s;tanding this pro|hibition, the art of divination by the drum is exer|ci&s;ed in &s;ecret, both by men and women.</P>

<HEAD>CHARACTER, MANNERS, and CUSTOMS of the LAPLANDERS.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e people are &s;imple, hone&s;t, ho&s;pitable, and ti|morous: their timidity, however, re&s;pects war alone; for to many other &s;pecies of danger they expo&s;e them&s;elves with &s;urpri&s;ing intrepidity, whether in

a&s;cending and de&s;cending mountains and preci|pices with their &s;now-&s;hoes and in &s;ledges, or in venturing amid&s;t whirlpools and cataracts in little &s;lender boats made of thin fir-boards, fa&s;tened to|gether with thongs of leather, &s;inews of wild bea&s;ts, or tough and flexible twigs of willow and o&s;ier. The&s;e boats are of different &s;izes, from two to &s;ix yards in length, managed with oars, and caulked with mo&s;s, &s;o tight as to keep out the water.</P>
<P>The Laplanders are more or le&s;s civilized as they communicate with &s;trangers, or live among woods and fore&s;ts, &s;eque&s;tered from all corre&s;pon|dence. The mountaineers live chiefly on the fle&s;h and the milk of the rein-deer. The fle&s;h they dry in the cold, and the milk produces abundance of chee&s;e. Tho&s;e who live in the low country, feed on veni&s;on and fi&s;h. They have neither bread nor &s;alt; but, in lieu of both, u&s;e the inner rind of the pine-tree, dried and ground, and dried fi&s;h re|duced to powder. They make confections and decoctions of berries, angelica, and &s;orrel, which they deem pre&s;ervatives again&s;t the &s;curvy. They make broth of fi&s;h and fle&s;h boiled together; and their u&s;ual drink is water heated in a kettle, which hangs continually over the fire in winter: but their greate&s;t dainty is bears-fle&s;h, which they eat on all great fe&s;tivals. On the&s;e occa&s;ions likewi&s;e they indulge them&s;elves with brandy, and never think them&s;elves &s;o happy as when they can enjoy a pipe of tobacco. The&s;e commodities, together with a few cows and &s;heep for their winter-&s;tore, the bet|ter &s;ort of Laplanders purcha&s;e in Norway.</P>
<P>They lodge in wretched hou&s;es, compo&s;ed of rafters joined together, and covered partly with turf, and partly with the boughs or bark of pine|trees, and a coar&s;e kind of cloath. Each hut is furni&s;hed with two doors, one &s;maller than the
<PB N="203" REF="2140">
other: at the former the men &s;ally forth to their hunting, or other occupations; but no woman is permitted to make u&s;e of this entry, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould meet the man in his out-going; a circum&s;tance in|terpreted into a very bad omen. They have neither chimney nor window; but a hole at the top of the hut, which lets in the light, and lets out the &s;moke. In a word, the&s;e habitations are no more than mi&s;erable hovels, without conve|nience or comfort; in which the people &s;it or lie promi&s;cuou&s;ly, like bea&s;ts, around the fire, inve|loped in a thick impenetrable gloom of acrid &s;moke, that corrodes their eyes, and renders the atmo|&s;phere altogether unfit for re&s;piration. Yet, even here, the poor Laplander is content with his &s;itua|tion, and enjoys life with &s;ome degree of reli&s;h: he has his fea&s;ts, his feats, his diver&s;ions, and his amours. He is &s;ecured in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of unin|terrupted health by temperance and exerci&s;e, which, together with the &s;everity of the climate, brace his nerves to a very unu&s;ual pitch of &s;trength, and fortify his con&s;titution in &s;uch a manner, that he often lives to the age of an hun|dred, without feeling the lea&s;t pang of di&s;temper, or even perceiving his vigour impaired; for it is not uncommon to &s;ee a Laplander in extreme old age hunting, fowling, &s;kaiting, and performing all the &s;evere&s;t exerci&s;es with undimini&s;hed agility.</P>
<P>The &s;ummer-garb of the men con&s;i&s;ts of a long coat of coar&s;e cloth, reaching down to the middle of the leg, and girded round the wai&s;t with a belt or girdle; from which depend a Norway knife, and a pouch, containing &s;lints, matches, and to|bacco, with other nece&s;&s;aries; the girdle it&s;elf being decorated with bra&s;s rings and chains. Their caps are made of the &s;kin of the lumme, or northern diver, with the feathers on; and their &s;hoes are of the rein-deer &s;kin, with the hair outwards. They wear
<PB N="204" REF="2150">
no linnen; but the garments of the better &s;ort are of a finer cloth, and they delight in a variety of colours; though red, as being the mo&s;t glaring, is the mo&s;t agreeable. In winter they are totally ca&s;ed up in coats, caps, boots, and gloves, made of the rein-deers &s;kin, with the hair inwards. The women's apparel differs very little from that of the other &s;ex; only their girdles are more ornamented with rings, chains, needle-ca&s;es, and toys, that &s;ometimes weigh twenty pounds. In winter both men and women lie in their furs: in &s;ummer they cover them&s;elves intirely with coar&s;e blankets, to defend them from the gnats, which are intolerable. The Laplanders are not only well di&s;po&s;ed, but naturally ingenious. They make all their own furniture, their boats, their &s;ledges, their bows and arrows. They form neat boxes of thin birch|boards, and inlay them with the horn of the rein|deer. The Swedes are very fond of the Lapland ba&s;kets, made of the roots of trees, &s;lit in long thin pieces, and twi&s;ted together &s;o nicely that they will hold water. Among the manufactures of that country we likewi&s;e number curious horn-&s;poons, and moulds in which they ca&s;t the tin-jewels that adorn their girdles. Over and above the&s;e do|me&s;tic occupations, the men within doors perform the office of cooks, in dre&s;&s;ing victuals for the family. The women act as taylors and embroi|derers: they make cloaths, &s;hoes, and boots, and harne&s;s for the rein-deer: they &s;pin thread of fur, and knit it into caps and gloves, that are &s;oft and warm: they draw tin into wire through a horn, and with this they cover their thread, which they u&s;e in embroidering the figures of bea&s;ts, flowers, trees, and &s;tars upon their caps and girdles.</P>
<P>The Laplanders make &s;urpri&s;ing excur&s;ions upon the &s;now in their hunting expeditions. They pro|vide them&s;elves each with a pair of &s;kates, or &s;now|&s;hoes,
<PB REF="2160">
<FIGURE>
<HEAD>$Span$</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="205" REF="2170">
which are no other than fir-boards covered with the rough &s;kin of the rein-deer, turned in &s;uch a manner, that the hair ri&s;es again&s;t the &s;now, otherwi&s;e they would be too &s;lippery. One of the&s;e &s;hoes is u&s;ually as long as the per&s;on who wears them; the other is about a foot &s;horter. The feet &s;tand in the middle, and to them they are fa&s;tened by thongs, or withs. The Laplander, thus equipped, wields a long pole in his hand, near the end of which there is a round ball of wood, to prevent its piercing too deep in the &s;now; and with this he &s;tops him&s;elf occa&s;ionally. By means of the&s;e accou|trements he will travel at the rate of &s;ixty miles a-day, without being fatigued: he will a&s;cend &s;teep moun|tains, and &s;lide down again with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Laplander not only travels a-foot, but is provided with a carriage drawn by the rein|deer, in which he journeys with &s;till greater rapi|dity. This &s;ledge, called pulkha, is made in the form of a &s;mall boat, with a convex bottom, that it may &s;lide the more ea&s;ily over the &s;now: the prow is &s;harp and pointed; but the &s;ledge is flat behind. The, traveller is &s;wathed in this carriage like an infant in a cradle, with a &s;tick in his hand, to &s;teer the ve&s;&s;el, and di&s;engage it from pieces of rock or &s;tumps of trees, that may chance to en|counter it in the route. He mu&s;t al&s;o ballance the &s;ledge with his body, otherwi&s;e he will be in dan|ger of being overturned. The traces, by which this carriage is fa&s;tened to the rein-deer, are fixed to a collar about the animal's neck, and run down over the brea&s;t, between the fore and hind legs, to be connected with the prow of the &s;ledge: the reins, managed by the traveller, are tied to the horns; and the trappings are furni&s;hed with little bells, the &s;ound of which is agreeable to the ani|mal. With this draught at his tail, the rein-deer
<PB N="206" REF="2180">
will fly like lightning over hill and dale, &s;o as to run at the rate of two hundred miles a-day: before he &s;ets out the Laplander whi&s;pers in his ear the way he is to follow, and the place at which he is to halt; firmly per&s;uaded, that the bea&s;t under&s;tands his meaning: but, in &s;pite of this intimation, he frequently &s;tops &s;hort, long before he has reached the journey's end; and &s;ometimes he over&s;hoots the mark by &s;everal leagues. When the traveller endeavours to manage him by the reins, he very often proves re&s;tif, and is &s;o much incen&s;ed, that he kicks the carriage with great fury. In that ca&s;e the Laplander overturns it for his own pre&s;erva|tion, and lies under it, like a tortoi&s;e in his &s;hell, until the animal has gratified his revenge. Not|with&s;tanding all the boa&s;ted docility of the rein|deer, it mu&s;t be owned, that his &s;urpri&s;ing pro|gre&s;s with the&s;e &s;ledges, is no more than a con&s;tant endeavour to di&s;engage him&s;elf from an incum|brance: nor is this way of travelling either ea&s;y, or exempted from the mo&s;t imminent danger, from the uncertainty of the roads, and the drifts of loo&s;e &s;now, which, if the wind blows high, are driven about with incredible fury. The po&s;ture of a man in one of the&s;e pulkhas is half &s;itting, and half lying, &s;o as to be extremely confined and unea&s;y. In the beginning of winter the Laplanders mark the mo&s;t frequented roads, by &s;trewing them with fir-boughs; and, indeed, the&s;e roads are no other than pathways made through the &s;now by the rein|deer and the pulkhas: their being frequently co|vered with new &s;now, and alternately beaten by the carriage, con&s;olidates them into a kind of cau&s;e|way; which is the harder, if the &s;urface has felt a partial thaw, and been cru&s;ted by a &s;ub&s;equent fro&s;t. It requires great caution to follow the&s;e tracks; for, if the carriage deviates to the right
<PB N="207" REF="2190">
or left, the traveller is plunged into an aby&s;s of &s;now. In le&s;s frequented parts, where there is no &s;uch beaten road, the Laplander directs his cour&s;e by certain marks which he has made on the trees; but, notwith&s;tanding all his caution, the rein-deer very often &s;inks up to the horns in &s;now. Should a hurricane ari&s;e, the &s;now would be whirled about in &s;uch a manner as to blind and overwhelm the traveller, unle&s;s he &s;hould be provided with a tent, to &s;creen him in &s;ome mea&s;ure from the fury of the tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>The Laplanders recount many &s;tories of per&s;ons, who, together with their pulkhas and rein-deer, have been whirled aloft in the air by tho&s;e hurri|canes; and &s;ometimes da&s;hed again&s;t rocks, and &s;ometimes precipitated into the mid&s;t of lakes and rivers.</P>
<P>In winter the rein-deer is weak, meagre, and di&s;pirited, &s;o that he does not travel with alacrity: his ma&s;ter is obliged to halt from time to time, that the animal may re&s;t him&s;elf; and in the&s;e in|tervals he is fed with a kind of cake, made of mo&s;s and &s;now, which &s;erves him both for drink and provender. While the &s;now is loo&s;e, the rein-deer will dig with his feet to a prodigious depth, in que&s;t of this vegetable; but when the &s;urface of the earth is cru&s;ted with ice, the natives mu&s;t be at the pains to break it, for the benefit of the&s;e animals. Neverthele&s;s, the Laplanders have great rea&s;on to cheri&s;h this creature with uncommon re|gard, as the be&s;t gift of Providence; for, without &s;ubjecting them to the lea&s;t expence, the rein-deers &s;upply them with almo&s;t every nece&s;&s;ary of life. From this animal the Laplander is furni&s;hed with milk and chee&s;e: he eats the fle&s;h, and pre&s;erves it for winter-&s;tore. The &s;kin affords caps, cloaths, boots, &s;hoes, bedding, thongs, and many other conveniences. The nerves and &s;inews are twi&s;ted
<PB N="208" REF="2200">
into thread: their bows and arrows are tipped with the bones, and their boxes inlaid with the horn, which is likewi&s;e formed into curious &s;poons, toys, and uten&s;ils. The&s;e animals, when alive, not only &s;erve the purpo&s;es already mentioned, but are like|wi&s;e u&s;ed as bea&s;ts of draught and burthen; and, far from demanding a provi&s;ion of provender, dig with their own feet among the &s;now for the mo&s;s, which they prefer to all other provi&s;ion.</P>
<P>The chief occupation of the Laplanders is hunt|ing, and this exerci&s;e they perform in various ways. In &s;ummer they hunt the wild bea&s;ts with &s;mall dogs, trained to the diver&s;ion. In winter they pur&s;ue them by their tracks upon the &s;now, &s;kat|ing with &s;uch velocity, that they very often run down the prey. They catch ermines in traps, and &s;ometimes with dogs. They kill &s;quirrels, mar|tens, and &s;ables with blunt darts, to avoid wound|ing the &s;kin. Foxes and beavers are &s;lain with &s;harp-pointed darts and arrows, in &s;hooting which they are accounted the be&s;t mark&s;men in the world. The larger bea&s;ts, &s;uch as bears, wolves, elks, and wild rein-deer, they either kill with fire-arms, pur|cha&s;ed in Sweden or Norway, or take in &s;nares, and pits dug in the fore&s;ts. Their particular laws, relating to the chace, are ob&s;erved with great punctuality. The bea&s;t becomes the property of the man in who&s;e &s;nare or pit he is caught; and he who di&s;covers a bear's den has the exclu&s;ive pri|vilege of hunting him to death. The conque&s;t of a bear is the mo&s;t honourable atchievement that a Laplander can perform; and the fle&s;h of this ani|mal they account the greate&s;t delicacy on earth. The bear is always di&s;patched with a fu&s;il, &s;ome|times laid as a &s;nare, ready cocked and primed; but more frequently in the hands of the hunter, who runs the mo&s;t imminent ri&s;que of his life, &s;hould he mi&s;s his aim of wounding the bea&s;t mor|tally.
<PB N="209" REF="2210">
The death of a bear is celebrated by the Laplanders as a &s;ignal victory. The carca&s;e is drawn to the cabin or hut of the victor by a rein|deer, which is kept &s;acred from any other work for a whole year after this &s;ervice. The bear is &s;urrounded by a great number of men, women, and children, reciting a particular hymn, or &s;ong of triumph; in which they thank the vanqui&s;hed enemy for having allowed him&s;elf to be overcome, without doing any mi&s;chief to his conqueror, and welcome his arrival: then they make an apo&s;trophe to heaven, expre&s;&s;ing their acknowledgment to God, that he has created bea&s;ts for the u&s;e of men, and endued mankind with &s;trength and courage to overcome and attack the fierce&s;t of the brute crea|tion. The hero is &s;aluted by the women, who &s;pit chewed elder-bark in his face. He is fea&s;ted three days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, and his cap is decorated with an additional figure wrought in tin-wire.</P>
<P>The manner in which the young Laplander chu&s;es a wife is equally remarkable and ludicrous. When he has pitched upon a female, he employs &s;ome friends as mediators with the father; and the&s;e being provided with &s;ome bottles of brandy, the &s;uitor accompanies them to the hut of his fu|ture father-in-law, who invites the mediators to enter; but the lover is left without, until the liquor be drank, and the propo&s;al di&s;cu&s;&s;ed: then he is called in, and entertained with &s;uch fare as the hut affords, yet without &s;eeing his mi&s;tre&s;s, who retires, and goes out on this occa&s;ion. Having obtained leave of her parents to make his addre&s;&s;es in per&s;on, he puts on his be&s;t apparel, is admitted to the lady, whom he &s;alutes with a ki&s;s: then he pre&s;ents her with the tongue of a rein-deer, a piece of beaver's fle&s;h, or &s;ome other &s;ort of provi&s;ion. She declines the offer, which is made in pre&s;ence of her &s;i&s;ters and relations; but makes a &s;ignal to
<PB N="210" REF="2220">
the lover to follow her into the fields, where &s;he accepts the pre&s;ents. Thus encouraged, he begs her permi&s;&s;ion to &s;leep with her in the hut: if &s;he con&s;ents, there is no further difficulty: if &s;he di&s;|approves of the propo&s;al, &s;he drops his pre&s;ents on the ground. When the lovers are agreed, the youth is permitted to vi&s;it his inamorata as often as he &s;hall think proper; but every time he comes, he mu&s;t purcha&s;e this plea&s;ure with a fre&s;h bottle of brandy: a perqui&s;ite &s;o agreeable to the father, that he often po&s;tpones the celebration of the nup|tials for two or three years. At length the cere|mony is performed at church, by the prie&s;t of the pari&s;h. Even after this event, the hu&s;band is obliged to &s;erve his father-in-law a whole year; at the expiration of which he retires to his own habi|tation with his wife, and her patrimony of rein|deer, and receives pre&s;ents from all his friends and relations. From this period he &s;eque&s;ters his wife from the company of all &s;trangers, e&s;pecially of the male &s;ex, and watches over her conduct with the mo&s;t jealous vigilance.</P>
<P>Many Lapland women are barren, and none of them are very fruitful. A woman, immediately after delivery, &s;wallows a draught of whale-fat: the child is wa&s;hed with &s;now, or cold water, and wrapped up in a hare-&s;kin. The mother is &s;eldom above five days in the &s;traw, and in fourteen is generally quite recovered: then &s;he carries the child to church to be baptized. Before &s;he can reach the re&s;idence of the prie&s;t, &s;he is often obliged to traver&s;e large fore&s;ts, mountains, lakes, and wide-extended wa&s;tes of &s;now. The infant is fa&s;tened in a hollowed piece of wood, &s;tretched naked on a bed of fine mo&s;s, covered with the &s;oft &s;kin of a young rein-deer, and &s;lung by two &s;traps to the back of the mother, who always &s;uckles her own child. At home this little cradle is hung to
<PB N="211" REF="2230">
the roof of the hut, and the child lulled a&s;leep by &s;winging it from one &s;ide to the other. The boys, from their infancy, practi&s;e the bow; and are not al|lowed to break their fa&s;t, until they have hit the mark. The female children are as early initiated in the bu&s;ine&s;s peculiar to their &s;ex.</P>
<P>The&s;e people, though for the mo&s;t part vigor|ous and healthy, are not altogether exempted from di&s;temper. They are &s;ubject to &s;ore eyes, and even to blindne&s;s, from the &s;moke of their huts, and the fire to which they are almo&s;t continually expo&s;ed. Some wa&s;te away in con&s;umptions; others are af|flicted with rheumatic pains, and the &s;curvy; and a few are &s;ubject to vertigo and apoplexy. For the cure of all their internal di&s;orders, they u&s;e no other medicine than the decoction of a certain &s;pe|cies of mo&s;s; and, when this cannot be procured, they boil the &s;talk of angelica in the milk of the rein-deer. In order to remove a fixed pain, they apply a large mu&s;hroom, burning hot, to the part affected; and this produces a bli&s;ter, which is &s;up|po&s;ed to draw off the peccant humour. To their wounds they apply nothing but the turpentine that drops from the fir-tree. When they are fro&s;t|bitten, they thru&s;t a red hot iron into a chee&s;e, made of rein-deer's milk, and with the fat that drops from it anoint the frozen member, which generally recovers. When a Laplander is &s;up|po&s;ed to be on his death-bed, his friends exhort him to die in the faith of Chri&s;t, and bear his &s;uf|ferings with re&s;ignation, by remembering the pa&s;|&s;ion of our Saviour. They are not, however, very ready to attend him in his la&s;t moments; and as &s;oon as he expires quit the place with precipita|tion, apprehending &s;ome injury from his &s;pirit or gho&s;t, which they believe remains with the corp&s;e, and takes all opportunities of doing mi&s;|chief to the living. The decea&s;ed is wrapped up
<PB N="212" REF="2240">
in woollen or linnen, according to his circum|&s;tances, and depo&s;ited in a coffin by a per&s;on &s;e|lected for that purpo&s;e: but this office he will not perform, unle&s;s he is fir&s;t &s;ecured from the ill|offices of the manes, by a con&s;ecrated bra&s;s ring fixed on his left arm. The chri&s;tian religion in this country has not yet di&s;pelled all the rites of heatheni&s;h &s;uper&s;tition: together with the body they put in the coffin an ax, a flint, and &s;teel, a fla&s;k of brandy, &s;ome dried fi&s;h and veni&s;on. With the ax the decea&s;ed is &s;uppo&s;ed to hew down the bu&s;hes or boughs that may ob&s;truct his pa&s;&s;age in the other world: the &s;teel and flint are de&s;igned for &s;triking a light, &s;hould he find him&s;elf in the dark at the day of judgment; and on the provi&s;ion they think he may &s;ub&s;i&s;t during his journey.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;covite Laplanders ob&s;erve other cere|monies, that bear an affinity to the &s;uper&s;titions of the Greek church. They not only &s;upply the de|funct with money, but likewi&s;e provide him with money for the porter of Paradi&s;e, and a certificate &s;igned by the prie&s;t, and directed to St. Peter, &s;pecifying that the bearer had lived like a good Chri&s;tian, and ought to be admitted into heaven. At the head of the coffin they place a little image of St. Nicholas, who is greatly reverenced in all parts of Mu&s;covy as a friend to the dead. Before the interment, the friends of the decea&s;ed kindle a fire of fir-boughs near the coffin, and expre&s;s their &s;orrow in tears and lamentations. They walk in proce&s;&s;ion &s;everal times round the body, de|manding, in a whining tone, the rea&s;on of his leaving them on earth. They a&s;k whether he was out of humour with his wife; whether he was in want of meat, drink, cloathing, or other nece&s;&s;a|ries; and whether he had not &s;ucceeded in hunt|ing and fi&s;hing? The&s;e and other &s;uch interroga|tions, to which the defunct makes no reply, are
<PB N="213" REF="2250">
intermingled with groans and hideous howlings; and, between whiles, the prie&s;t &s;prinkles the corp&s;e and the mourners alternately with holy water. Finally, the body is conveyed to the place of in|terment on a &s;ledge, drawn by a rein-deer; and this, together with the cloaths of the decea&s;ed, are left as the prie&s;t's perqui&s;ite. Three days after the burial, the kin&s;men and friends of the defunct are invited to an entertainment, where they eat the fle&s;h of the rein-deer which conveyed the corp&s;e to the burying-ground. This being a &s;acrifice to the manes, the bones are collected into a ba&s;ket, and interred. Two thirds of the effects of the decea&s;ed are inherited by his brothers, and the remainder divided among his &s;i&s;ters: but the lands, lakes, and rivers, are held in coparceny by all the chil|dren of both &s;exes, according to the divi&s;ion made by Charles IX. of Sweden, when he a&s;&s;igned a cer|tain tract of land to each family.</P>

<HEAD>COMMERCE, STRENGTH, and REVENUE.</HEAD>
<P>The commerce of the Laplanders is more con|&s;iderable than one would expect in a de&s;art coun|try, inhabited by a &s;avage ignorant people. They export great quantities of fi&s;h to the northern parts of Bothnia and White Ru&s;&s;ia. They likewi&s;e trade with the neighbouring countries of Norway, Swe|den, Mu&s;covy, and Finland, by &s;elling rein-deer, fine furs, ba&s;kets, and toys of their own manufac|ture, dried pikes, and chee&s;e made of the rein|deer's milk. In return for the&s;e commodities they receive rixdollars, woollen cloths, linnen, copper, tin, flour, oil, hides, needles, knives, &s;pirituous liquors, tobacco, and other nece&s;&s;aries. The Lap|landers march in caravans to the fairs in Finland and Norway: the&s;e are compo&s;ed of a long &s;tring of thirty or forty rein-deer and pulkhas, tied to one another, the foremo&s;t being led by a Lap|lander
<PB N="214" REF="2260">
a-foot. When they have cho&s;en a &s;pot for an encampment, which is often in the mid&s;t of a river, they form a large circle of their rein-deer and pulkhas ready yoked; and the animals, lying down quietly on the &s;now, are fed with mo&s;s by their ma&s;ters. The people kindle great fires, around which men, women, and children &s;it, and &s;up on dried fi&s;h: but the more voluptuous pitch their tents on the ice, and &s;pread their bear-&s;kins, on which they lie at their ea&s;e, and &s;moke tobacco.</P>
<P>The revenue ari&s;ing from this country is of no great con&s;equence: it is payed partly in rixdollars, but chiefly in furs: nay, &s;ome, that can procure neither, pay the tribute in dried pikes. The pro|duce of the mines forms likewi&s;e a con&s;iderable article. Fifty &s;quirrel &s;kins, or one fox-&s;kin, with a pair of Lapland &s;hoes, are valued at one rixdollar. Part of the taxes is allotted for the maintenance of the Lapland clergy.</P>
<P>The frightful a&s;pect of this country has been deemed a more effectual defence than artificial bul|works and garri&s;ons, of which here are none; or than the arms and courage of the natives, who are neither warlike in them&s;elves, nor in the lea&s;t tinc|tured with di&s;cipline.</P>

<HEAD>THE PARTICULAR DISTRICTS OF SWEDISH LAPLAND.</HEAD>
<P>ANgermandland-Lapmark is the mo&s;t &s;outhern province of Lapland, and the principal town is Ao&s;alko. The whole country, however, is inter|&s;per&s;ed, though at great di&s;tances, with little vil|lages that de&s;erve no particular de&s;cription. Uma-Lapmark,
<PB N="215" REF="2270">
&s;ituated more northerly, is denominated from the river Uma, which traver&s;es the di&s;trict from we&s;t to ea&s;t, through &s;everal exten&s;ive lakes, receiving in its cour&s;e the river Wendela, which is very con&s;iderable. In the middle of this province &s;tands the hamlet Lai&s;by; and another, called Se|misjerfie, is &s;ituated on the confines of Pytha. The next di&s;trict is Pytha-Lapmark, bounded on the we&s;t by the Norwegian mountains, by Bothnia on the ea&s;t, and Lula-Lapmark on the north. This province is remarkable for a great number of large lakes, and contains three villages; namely, Sitonia, in the north, near the Dofrine mountains; Ar|roitzerfs, in the middle of the di&s;trict; and Loch|tari, near the confines of Bothnia. Lula-Lapmark lies between the mountains of Norway and Both|nia, to the northward of Pitha-Lapmark, and to the &s;outhward of Torno. The rivers of this di&s;|trict are the Great and Little Lula, which run through different lakes, cro&s;&s;ing the Polar Circle, and join near the village of Jackmath, in the &s;outh|we&s;t part of the di&s;trict. Towards the north are the villages of Torpajour and Sirkeflucht, &s;ituated at the di&s;tance of thirty miles from each other.</P>
<P>Torno-Lapmark is the mo&s;t northern province of Swedi&s;h Lapland, bounded on the north-we&s;t by the Dofrine mountains, by Dani&s;h Lapland on the north, by Lula-Lapmark on the &s;outh, and on the ea&s;t by part of Bothnia and Kimi-Lapmark. Its chief rivers are Calix, Torno, and Kengis, which la&s;t di&s;embogues it&s;elf in the Torno, at a place called Kengis. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable lake of this di&s;trict is al&s;o denominated Torno; near which &s;tands the village of Tingavara; and there is a copper-mine about eighty miles towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t of this place. The other villages of Torno-Lapmark are Rounala and Sandewara, to
<PB N="216" REF="2280">
the ea&s;tward of Tingavara; and Titi&s;ara, a few miles to the &s;outhward. It was in this di&s;trict that four members of the French academy mea&s;ured a degree of the meridian, in the year 1736, in order to a&s;certain the figure of the earth.</P>
<P>Kimi Lapmark lies between the gulph of Both|nia, Mu&s;covite Lapland, and Dani&s;h Lapland. The northern part of this province is remarkable for the great lake Encure, which gives ri&s;e to a river that runs into the Frozen Sea, a little beyond the &s;eventeenth degree of north latitude. The principal places of this di&s;trict are Soniby, Kimibi, and Kalajeriui, &s;ituated at the foot of the moun|tains which divide this country from Dani&s;h and Mu&s;covite Lapland. Solden-Kyli, and Kitijor|fuilye, are more to the &s;outhward; and the town of Kimi &s;tands at the mouth of the river &s;o called, on the gulph of Bothnia.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CURIOSITIES of NATURE, and of ART.</HEAD>
<P>In the province of Torno there is a &s;pring of pure water i&s;&s;uing from the mountain Kittis, which, in the &s;evere&s;t winter, &s;till pre&s;erves its fluidity. About thirty leagues to the northward of this place, in the middle of a va&s;t fore&s;t, be|tween the Ocean and the gulph of Bothnia, is a &s;tone monument, which the Laplanders revere as the greate&s;t wonder of their country. This is a &s;tone about three feet in length, of an irregular form, appearing one foot and an half above ground. The &s;urface, which &s;lopes a little, exhibits two lines of what re&s;embles letters, about an inch long, and very deep, that &s;eem to have been cut by the tool of a ma&s;on: below the&s;e lines are &s;ome cha|racters, &s;till larger; but whether they are the work of Nature, or of Art, it is not ea&s;y to determine.
<PB N="217" REF="2290">
The &s;tone appears to be compo&s;ed of different layers: that on which the characters are engraven is a kind of flint; but the interval between the lines is much more &s;oft and &s;caly. Mr. Brunnius, curate of the place, has publi&s;hed a de&s;cription of Torno and its neighbourhood, in which he de|&s;cribes this &s;tone; and affirms, that the in&s;cription is in the Runic character: he likewi&s;e declares, that the &s;tone formerly exhibited the figures of three crowns, which time has now effaced. But Mr. Cel&s;ius, who was a connoi&s;&s;eur in that lan|guage, could not read the characters, which were quite different from tho&s;e he had &s;een in Sweden; and of the crowns there is not the lea&s;t ve&s;tige to be perceived. It would be a difficult ta&s;k to ac|count for an in&s;cription in the heart of Lapland, a country &s;carce acce&s;&s;ible to foreigners; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e it a kind of tomb-&s;tone, erected to the memory of &s;ome per&s;on, who perhaps having been &s;hipwrecked in the gulph of Bothnia, penetrated thus far with &s;ome attendants in que&s;t of &s;uccour, and in this place expired. There is &s;omething ex|travagantly improbable in the notion of Mauper|tuis, who thinks that this monument was erected at a time when Lapland enjoyed a more favourable climate, before &s;ome of tho&s;e grand revolutions by which the po&s;ition of the earth has been altered. <Q>&startq;The Polar Circles (&s;ays he) were then perhaps what the Tropics are now; and the Torrid Zone occupied the place of what is now called the Temperate Zones.&endq;</Q></P>

<HEAD>SITUATION and EXTENT.</HEAD>
<P>THE kingdom of Sweden, or Suecia, in|cluding the greate&s;t part of Scandinavia, extends from 55 degrees and 20 minutes, to 69 degrees and 30 minutes northern latitude, lying between the 12th and 32d degrees of longi|tude ea&s;t from London. On the &s;outh it is bounded by the Baltic, the Sound, and the Scha|ger-rack, or Categate; on the north by Dani&s;h Lapland; on the ea&s;t by Mu&s;covy; and on the we&s;t by the mountains of Norway. The country is twice as large as France; but great part of it being en|gro&s;&s;ed by &s;eas, lakes, mountains, hills, woods, heaths, and mar&s;hes, the number of inhabitants bears a very &s;mall proportion to the extent of its boundaries.</P>

<PB N="219" REF="2310">
<HEAD>DIVISION, MOUNTAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>Sweden is divided into &s;even parts, namely, Sweden, properly &s;o called, bounded by Norway and the gulph of Bothnia, Gothland, Livonia, In|gria, Finland, Lapland, and the i&s;lands in the Bal|tic. The&s;e, and the &s;ubdivi&s;ions, we &s;hall parti|cularly de&s;cribe, after having given a general ac|count of the whole.</P>
<P>The remarkable mountains, rivers, lakes, and fore&s;ts, will enter into that de&s;cription: &s;uffice it to ob&s;erve in general, that the mountains are nu|merous, huge, and hoary; that the kingdom is watered by many navigable rivers; that the lakes are of prodigious extent and incredible depth, not only &s;upplying &s;warms of delicious fi&s;h, but al&s;o affording the convenience of carriage, in boats in the &s;ummer, and on &s;leds in the winter; that in the&s;e lakes, and along the &s;ea-coa&s;t, there are in|numerable i&s;lands, of which above &s;ix thou&s;and are actually inhabited: the re&s;t are either bare rocks, or &s;mall i&s;les covered with wood: that the face of the country is in a great mea&s;ure over&s;pread by va&s;t fore&s;ts of pine, fir, beech, birch, alder, juniper, and &s;ome oak. The&s;e trees grow &s;o clo&s;e together, and &s;uch a number of tho&s;e that fall are left to rot where they lie, that in many places the woods are altogether impa&s;&s;able. The timber is, in general, as good as that of Norway; and there is &s;uch abun|dance of it, that firing is very cheap and plentiful.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE, LIGHT, and SEASONS.</HEAD>
<P>If the winter's cold in Sweden be inten&s;e, the heat of the &s;ummer is exce&s;&s;ive. The &s;un, at the highe&s;t, continues above the horizon of Stockholm eighteen hours and a half, and produces an unin|terrupted
<PB N="220" REF="2320">
day of &s;everal weeks; and in winter day|light is proportionably defective: yet this defect is tolerably well &s;upplied by the moon, the &s;tars, and the northern lights, reflected from the &s;now, thro' the medium or a &s;ky remarkably &s;crene.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to &s;ea&s;ons, there is no regular &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion of &s;pring and &s;ummer. The winter &s;ets in early, without any intervention of mild weather analogous to our autumn; and the &s;ummer &s;eems to bur&s;t at once from the embraces of winter, with|out being gradually di&s;engaged by the interpo&s;i|tion of &s;pring. The productions of the earth ve|getate and ripen more &s;peedily than in &s;outhern climates, becau&s;e they are warmed by an uninter|rupted &s;un, which is &s;o hot as often to &s;et the woods on fire, and produce dreadful conflagrations. On the other hand, &s;uch is the &s;everity of the win|ter's cold, that people are very apt to lo&s;e their limbs, no&s;es, and even life it&s;elf, if they neglect the proper precautions of wearing warm furs and &s;heep-&s;kins abroad, and of keeping their apart|ments comfortably warm with &s;toves, and other contrivances. When the no&s;e, or any extremity of a limb, begins to be affected by the fro&s;t, it ex|hibits a livid colour, as a &s;ymptom of a beginning mortification: in that ca&s;e the mo&s;t &s;peedy and ef|fectual remedy they have hitherto di&s;covered, is the &s;udden application of &s;now to the part affected.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL, VEGETABLES, and FRUITS.</HEAD>
<P>Where the face of the country is &s;o covered with rocks and mountains, the &s;oil cannot be in general fertile. There are, however, very fruitful &s;pots between the hills; and, even where the &s;oil is not more than half a foot from the &s;urface, the ground, if properly cultivated, would yield plenty of corn: but agriculture is very little under&s;tood in this country. The land is generally tilled with a &s;light
<PB N="221" REF="2330">
wooden plough, drawn by a &s;ingle ox, and con|ducted by one female &s;ervant. In barren parts the Swedi&s;h farmers burn a number of trees, and the &s;eed-corn being raked among the a&s;hes, produces good increa&s;e, without further cultivation. The Swedes are &s;o little &s;killed in hu&s;bandry, and &s;o little addict&egrave;d to this kind of labour, that they do not rai&s;e grain &s;ufficient for the occa&s;ions of the kingdom. Great quantities are imported from Livonia, and other countries bordering on the Bal|tic: the poorer &s;ort, in the remote parts of the kingdom, are obliged, in imitation of their Nor|wegian neighbours, to grind the inner bark of birch-trees, and u&s;e it in bread, mixed with a &s;mall proportion of flour. This &s;carcity, however, is owing rather to the idlene&s;s of the people, than to want of fertility in the land.</P>
<P>In &s;ummer the fields are cloathed with verdure, intermingled with a variety of flowers; and the whole face of the country, even the rocks included, is over&s;pread with &s;trawberries, ra&s;pberries, cur|rants, and other fruits of the &s;ame nature, &s;pon|taneou&s;ly produced. Their kitchen-gardens yield plenty of pot-herbs and roots. Melons are here brought to perfection in dry &s;ea&s;ons. Cherries of different kinds, and agreeable flavour, are found in their orchards. Their apples, pears, and plumbs, are more common than delicate: but apricots, peaches, and nectarines, are but little cultivated in this kingdom.</P>
<P>Sweden has native plants and vegetables, in common with other cold mountainous countries: a catalogue of them may be &s;een in the works of the celebrated Linnaeus, that great improver of botany.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<PB N="222" REF="2340">
<HEAD>ANIMALS: QUADRUPEDS.</HEAD>
<P>The cattle, hor&s;es, and &s;heep of Sweden re&s;emble tho&s;e of Norway in &s;ize and nature. Their beef and mutton is &s;mall, but &s;weet and juicy. Their wool is &s;o coar&s;e, that it can be u&s;ed for nothing but cloathing to the pea&s;ants. Their hor&s;es are hardy, nimble, &s;ure-footed, and &s;o &s;trong, that, if we may believe the Swedes, they are able to re&s;i&s;t and even break the be&s;t German cavalry.</P>
<P>Among the wild bea&s;ts of Sweden we number the elk, the deer, the bear, the hare, the wolf, the fox, the wild cat, the &s;quirrel, and other animals, which we have already de&s;cribed in our account of Denmark. The&s;e are hunted for their fle&s;h or fur, or both: the Swedi&s;h hunters generally kill their prey with guns, and are accounted excellent mark&s;|men.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>BIRDS.</HEAD>
<P>All &s;orts of poultry are reared in Sweden as in other countries. Of game there is great plenty, both land-birds and &s;ea-fowl. Be&s;ides partridges, and other birds called yerpers, which re&s;emble this &s;pecies, there is the orra, as large as a hen, and the keder, equal in &s;ize to a turkey. In winter the Swedi&s;h &s;port&s;men kill great numbers of thru&s;hes, blackbirds, and &s;yden&s;wans; which la&s;t are about the &s;ize of fieldfares, but of more exqui&s;ite flavour. They are gorgeou&s;ly arrayed in feathers, tipped with &s;carlet, and &s;uppo&s;ed to come from Lapland. Here too are pigeons, though very &s;carce in the woods, on account of the birds of prey which fre|quent this country; &s;uch as eagles, vultures, hawks, and kites. Some years ago a hawk is &s;aid to have been killed in Finland, having upon one leg a &s;mall plate of gold with this in&s;cription, <HI>Je</HI>
<PB N="223" REF="2350">
<HI>&s;uis au Roy;</HI> and on the other a plate of &s;ilver thus in&s;cribed, <HI>Le Duc de Chevreu&s;e me gard&eacute;.</HI></P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FISHES.</HEAD>
<P>The lakes and rivers of Sweden abound with &s;almon, trout, perch, tench, pikes, eels, and a fi&s;h called the &s;treamling, &s;maller than the pilcher, caught in great quantities, pickled, barrelled, and di&s;tributed through all parts of the kingdom. The gulph of Finland harbours va&s;t numbers of &s;eals, from which the natives extract a con&s;iderable quan|tity of train-oil for exportation. The lakes of this country are &s;o repleni&s;hed with pikes, that they are &s;alted and dried for &s;ale in great numbers.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>METALS and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>Sweden is famous for its mines of &s;ilver, cop|per, and iron; &s;ome of which have been worked from time immemorial: but the natives are either little acquainted with metallurgy, or the ore yields a very &s;mall proportion of metal. There is one &s;ilver mine, the fir&s;t gallery of which is above one hundred fathoms below the &s;urface of the earth: here is a &s;pace as large and as high as a church, and the roof is &s;upported by va&s;t arches of oak: from hence they de&s;cend above forty fathoms to the lowe&s;t vein. The mine produces about twenty thou&s;and crowns yearly in fine &s;ilver, which the king has the privilege of purcha&s;ing for one fourth le&s;s than the real value. The chief copper-mine is about eighty fathoms in depth, extending a great way under ground, and yielding a prodigious quantity of ore. The copper yearly produced, amounts to about two hundred thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; of which one fourth part, payed in kind, is the king's property: the remainder, if exported unwrought, is &s;addled with an additional duty of
<PB N="224" REF="2360">
five and twenty per centum. In the mountainous parts of Sweden, which afford water-falls for the conveniency of turning mills, the natives have erected forges, and pro&s;ecute the work of iron|mines with great indu&s;try. Over and above the con&s;umption of Sweden it&s;elf, the&s;e works have been known to &s;upply yearly iron for exportation to the value of three hundred thou&s;and pounds. But the bu&s;ine&s;s was at length over&s;tocked; and the foreign demand for iron being con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened, the commodity grew &s;o cheap, that the manufacturers could no longer proceed with any tolerable degree of advantage; &s;o that many forges were de&s;erted, and a great number of poor people, who depended upon the&s;e works, were deprived of their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their LANGUAGE, and RELI|GION.</HEAD>
<P>The Swedi&s;h language is a dialect of the antient Gothic or Teutonic, and bears a near affinity with that of Denmark. This language is a dialect of the Moe&s;o-gothic, &s;poken antiently by the inha|bitants of Moe&s;ian Tartary, from whence the northern parts of Europe are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been peopled. The only &s;pecimen of the language then &s;poken by the Scythian Goths in Moe&s;ia, is pre|&s;erved in the &s;ilver book at Up&s;al, being a tran&s;la|tion of the four Go&s;pels, by Ulphilas bi&s;hop of the Goths, &s;eated upon the <HI>Palus Moeotis.</HI> The pure&s;t dialect of this antient tongue is now found among the Dalekarlians, or Highlanders of Sweden, and in the i&s;land of Iceland; in which places curious people have ob&s;erved a &s;urpri&s;ing conformity with the Engli&s;h, both in language and pronunciation.</P>
<P>The Lutheran doctrine was e&s;tabli&s;hed in Swe|den &s;oon after it began to prevail in the prote&s;tant
<PB N="225" REF="2370">
parts of Germany. Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a, the founder of the pre&s;ent royal family in Sweden, was the prince who fir&s;t introduced the tenets of Luther. He a&s;cended the throne in the year 1523, and not only rendered the regal dignity hereditary in his own family, but e&s;tabli&s;hed the reformed religion in Sweden, where it &s;till continues to flouri&s;h with &s;urpri&s;ing uniformity. This is partly owing to the rigorous execution of the laws, which prohibit all &s;ects, and puni&s;h all di&s;&s;enters; partly to the na|ture and di&s;po&s;ition of the people, who are dull, ignorant, and entirely re&s;igned to the &s;piritual direction of their clergy, without any de&s;ire to in|quire or di&s;pute about controverted points of faith and doctrine; and, la&s;tly, to the care, a&s;&s;iduity, and regular lives of the clergy, by which they acquire a &s;urpri&s;ing influence over the minds of their au|dience. An attempt was once made to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Roman catholick religion in Sweden, and the peace of the country was not a little di&s;turbed: but the &s;cheme proved abortive; and now the go|vernment is &s;o much upon its guard again&s;t any future effort of the &s;ame kind, that no popi&s;h prie&s;t can enter the kingdom, without running the ri&s;que of ca&s;tration.</P>
<P>The Swedi&s;h church is governed by one arch|bi&s;hop and thirteen &s;uffragans, who confine them|&s;elves intirely to the occupations of their own function: they are, indeed, pre&s;ent at the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates; but are never called to council, nor do they ever intermeddle in the admini&s;tration of &s;tate-affairs. Their revenues are very moderate; that of the metropolitan not exceeding four hun|dred pounds &s;terling: tho&s;e of the bi&s;hops are pro|portionably &s;maller. Under the&s;e are &s;even or eight &s;uperintendants, ve&s;ted with the power, though not the name of bi&s;hops; and over each ten churches a provo&s;t or rural dean pre&s;ides, to &s;uperintend
<PB N="226" REF="2380">
the conduct of the inferior clergy; the number of whom, including chaplains and curates, may amount to four thou&s;and: for there may be about half that number of churches in Sweden and Finland.</P>
<P>Up&s;al is the metropolitan &s;ee of Sweden: the inferior dioce&s;es are tho&s;e of Linkopings, Skara, Strengnas, We&s;teros, Weg&s;io, Abo, Lund, Borgo, Gothembourg, Calmar, Carl&s;tad, Herno&s;and, and Wi&s;by. In the election of the archbi&s;hop all the con&s;i&s;tories or chapters of the kingdom give their votes; but the &s;uffragans are cho&s;en in the follow|ing manner: Three per&s;ons are pre&s;ented by the chapter to the king, who confers the dioce&s;e on one of them, with the advice of the &s;enate. Simple benefices are be&s;towed in Sweden, as in England, by right of pre&s;entation; which is &s;ometimes ve&s;ted in the crown, and &s;ometimes in the nobility. The inferior clergy are generally of the lower cla&s;s of people, &s;ons of pea&s;ants, or poor burghers; &s;o that they live the more contented with their &s;mall income, which ari&s;es from certain incon&s;iderable dues, glebe-lands, and one third of the tythes: the other two thirds are ve&s;ted in the crown, to be employed in pious and charitable u&s;es. Notwith|&s;tanding their poverty, the Swedi&s;h prie&s;ts are ex|tremely ho&s;pitable, in entertaining poor &s;trangers and travellers. The churches of Sweden are well ornamented with gilding, painting, and &s;culpture. They are kept neat and clean, in good repair, and furni&s;hed with rich altar-cloths and ve&s;tments. The church is governed according to a body of eccle&s;ia&s;tical laws and canons, revi&s;ed by a com|mittee cho&s;en from the different &s;tates that com|po&s;e the diet, and approved by the &s;overeign. By the&s;e it is decreed, that if any Swedi&s;h &s;ubject changes his religion, he &s;hall be bani&s;hed the king|dom, and lo&s;e all right of inheritance for him&s;elf and his de&s;cendants: that if any per&s;on continues

excommunicated above a year, he &s;hall be impri|&s;oned a month, during which he &s;hall be fed with bread and water only, and then bani&s;hed: that if any per&s;on &s;hall introduce into Sweden teachers of another religion, he &s;hall be fined and bani&s;hed: that foreign mini&s;ters &s;hall enjoy the free exerci&s;e of their religion for them&s;elves and families only: that &s;trangers &s;hall not be allowed to exerci&s;e a dif|ferent religion publickly; but their children &s;hall be baptized by Lutheran mini&s;ters, and educated in their communion, otherwi&s;e they &s;hall not enjoy the privileges of Swedi&s;h &s;ubjects. Thus the laity are obliged to a &s;trict attendance on the duties of religion; and, indeed, the civil magi&s;trate is im|powered to puni&s;h, with impri&s;onment, all tho&s;e who ab&s;ent them&s;elves from divine &s;ervice, with|out a proper excu&s;e. But the clergy are not in|tru&s;ted with the execution of their own laws; nor can they tran&s;act matters of any importance, with|out the concurrence of the civil power. Many cau&s;es, formerly cognizable in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, are now tried in &s;ecular tribunals. They are not even permitted to pronounce the &s;entence of excommunication without the king's permi&s;&s;ion, becau&s;e, in that ca&s;e, the &s;tate is deprived of a &s;ubject.</P>

<HEAD>Their LAWS and COURTS of JUDICATURE.</HEAD>
<P>The laws of Sweden con&s;i&s;t of a code which was compiled one hundred and fifty years ago, for the direction of the whole kingdom; and to the&s;e were joined po&s;terior edicts, and ordinances: but this code being defective, cau&s;es are very often decided by the civil law, as well as by the dictates of equity; and, if they are of any con&s;equence, they may be appealed to the king's &s;upreme court of revi&s;ion. There are four great tribunals of ju&s;tice, or par|liaments:
<PB N="228" REF="2400">
one e&s;tabli&s;hed at Stockholm for Swe|den, properly &s;o called: another at Jonkoping for Gothland: a third at Abo, for the principality of Finland: and a fourth at Wi&s;mar, in the circle of Lower Saxony, for tho&s;e German provinces that are &s;ubject to the Swedi&s;h dominions. In each of the&s;e tribunals or parliaments, which are &s;upreme, there is one pre&s;ident, and a certain number of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors: the four elde&s;t of the&s;e a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, in the parliament of Sweden, enjoy the title of coun&s;ellors of the ju&s;ticiary; but, in the other tribunals, two of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors only are honoured with this appellation. The&s;e national courts take cognizance of all actions that re&s;pect the life and honour of the &s;ubject, as well as of civil cau&s;es, which may be appealed to them from inferior courts of judicature. Their bu&s;ine&s;s likewi&s;e is to in&s;pect the conduct of infe|rior judges, whether provincial or territorial: for there is a court in every di&s;trict and corporation of the kingdom, ve&s;ted with a power to take exami|nations <HI>in loco,</HI> and try petty actions. In corpora|tions this court con&s;i&s;ts of an alderman, or coun|&s;ellor, as judge, and a certain number of his bre|thren as a&s;&s;i&s;tants. In provincial courts the go|vernor of the di&s;trict pre&s;ides, and determines by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a &s;tanding jury: his tribunal is ambulatory, and generally held on or near the &s;pot where the tre&s;pa&s;s was committed. Here exami|nations are taken, and trifling cau&s;es decided; but actions of any con&s;equence are evoked to the next &s;uperior court, of which there is one or more in every province, as well as in every corporation. The provincial judge is known by the name of Laghman. In the &s;uperior courts of cities, or cor|porations, the burgoma&s;ter pre&s;ides, and his alder|men are a&s;&s;i&s;tant. From the&s;e courts all cau&s;es of blood mu&s;t be transferred to the national tribunals, where they are determined without further appeal.
<PB N="229" REF="2410">
The &s;alaries of the judges being &s;mall, and their places often filled with men of mean talents, ex|po&s;ed to the temptations of corruption, as well as to the errors of ignorance, the &s;ubject would fre|quently have rea&s;on to complain of their mi&s;takes and partiality, were not all the &s;entences they pa&s;s in civil cau&s;es of any importance, &s;ubject to a re|view in the court of revi&s;ion, where the king in per&s;on pre&s;ides, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the pre&s;ident of the chancery, the chancellor of the court, and two or three privy coun&s;ellors.</P>
<P>Cau&s;es relating to the &s;ea are cognizable in the ordinary courts of ju&s;tice, and tried according to their marine laws, founded upon the antient &s;ea|laws of Wi&s;by in the i&s;le of Gothland, which were formerly as famous in the Baltic, as were the laws of Rhodes and Oleron in the places where the&s;e prevailed.</P>
<P>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es ought to be tried in the con&s;i&s;tory of each dioce&s;e. There the bi&s;hop, as pre&s;ident, tries ca&s;es of ba&s;tardy, contracts of mar|riage, and &s;uits of &s;candal; and denounces the church cen&s;ures of pennance or divorce: but this court has no power to admini&s;ter an oath, or to inflict any corporal puni&s;hment; and from it there lies an ap|peal to the national tribunal.</P>
<P>For di&s;putes relating to the mines there are in|ferior courts and officers, e&s;tabli&s;hed in tho&s;e parts of the country where the&s;e works are carried on; and from them cau&s;es of any importance are ap|pealed to a general tribunal, called the college of the mines, fixed at Stockholm. Of this the pre|&s;ident of the trea&s;ury is commonly the chief judge, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a vice-pre&s;ident, and other a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>The expence of law-&s;uits is very moderate in Sweden. Every man is permitted, and in criminal actions compelled to plead his own cau&s;e. The law is practi&s;ed by none but per&s;ons of an inferior
<PB N="230" REF="2420">
rank: the number of lawyers is but &s;mall, and they are generally in mean circum&s;tances. A jury of twelve men is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been originally a Swedi&s;h in&s;titution. At pre&s;ent, however, it is di&s;u&s;ed, except in the lowe&s;t courts in the country, where the jurymen are cho&s;en for life, and enjoy &s;alaries. In other courts the cau&s;e is determined by a majority of voices; but here the twelve mu&s;t be unanimous.</P>
<P>Titles to e&s;tates in Sweden are rendered the more &s;ecure, and le&s;s &s;ubject to conte&s;t, by the re|gi&s;ters of &s;ales, mortgages, and alienations, which are kept by every tribunal.</P>
<P>The governors of provinces, and the &s;tadt|holders of Stockholm and other towns, po&s;&s;e&s;s the power of executing all judicial &s;entences in their re&s;pective juri&s;dictions; and this power they occa|&s;ionally delegate to inferior officers, who are ac|countable to the national tribunals, before whom they may be &s;ummoned, and puni&s;hed, upon plain proof of default or delinquency. In crimi|nal matters, when the proof is deficient, and the judge favourable, the defendant is allowed to purge him&s;elf by oath, which mu&s;t be &s;upported by the oaths of twelve re&s;pon&s;ible men, as vouchers for his innocence. This very in&s;titution did Alfred introduce and e&s;tabli&s;h in England.</P>
<P>The crimes of trea&s;on, murther, adultery, wil|ful burning, and witchcraft, are puni&s;hed with death. The criminal, if a male, is hanged; if a woman, beheaded. Sometimes, according to the aggravation of the guilt, they are burned, quar|tered, or hung in chains. Criminals of a &s;uperior rank are commonly &s;hot to death. The puni&s;h|ment annexed to theft has been changed from death to a kind of perpetual &s;lavery. The crimi|nal$s condemned to work for his life at fortifica|tions, or other public labour. He is di&s;tingui&s;hed
<PB N="231" REF="2430">
by an iron collar round his neck, and a bell fa&s;tened to the end of a bow ri&s;ing over his head, which bell rings as he moves along. When the death of one party is the con&s;equence of a duel, the &s;urvivor is condemned to die, and a note of infamy is at|tached to the memory of both. If neither party falls in the combat, both are impri&s;oned, and fed for two years on bread and water: they are be&s;ides fined in a thou&s;and crowns each; or in two thou|&s;and crowns, if the impri&s;onment is limited to one year. An affront is referred to the re&s;pective na|tional court, where recantation, and begging par|don in public, are commonly awarded as a &s;uffi|cient reparation of honour.</P>
<P>E&s;tates de&s;cend by inheritance, in equal por|tions, to the children: of the&s;e portions a &s;on in|herits two, and a daughter one. This is nearly the old Briti&s;h cu&s;tom of gavel-kind. No parent can alter this di&s;po&s;ition, without a judicial &s;entence obtained, in ca&s;e any child &s;hould prove vitious or di&s;obedient: but he may bequeath one tenth of his acquired e&s;tate upon any particular favourite among his children. Upon the death of a man, who&s;e e&s;tate is incumbered with debts, the heir is allowed by the law two or three months, to inquire into and con&s;ider the circum&s;tances of the defunct, that he may either accept of the inheritance, or leave it to the law, which, in this ca&s;e, admini&s;ters.</P>

<HEAD>GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>The throne of Sweden was heretofore elective. In the year 1682 it became hereditary, and Charles XII. erected an ab&s;olute power. At his death a change of government immediately en&s;ued. His &s;i&s;ter and &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the prince&s;s Ulrica-Eleonora, no &s;ooner received information of his being killed at the &s;iege of Frederick&s;hal, in Norway, than &s;he
<PB N="232" REF="2440">
a&s;&s;embled the &s;enate, and was proclaimed queen of Sweden: perceiving, however, with what unea&s;i|ne&s;s and impatience the nation bore the de&s;potic government of her brother, &s;he re&s;olved to antici|pate the wi&s;hes of her &s;ubjects, in re&s;toring them to the fruition of their antient freedom. She forth|with i&s;&s;ued a proclamation, declaring &s;he would re|e&s;tabli&s;h the old form of government, and aboli&s;h|ing and renouncing, for her&s;elf and her &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, all ab&s;olute power and dominion. Nay, &s;he took &s;teps &s;till more extraordinary for the &s;atisfaction of her people: the &s;tates of Sweden being a&s;&s;embled at Stockholm, in the month of February, 1719, &s;he not only made a &s;olemn renunciation of all claim to ab&s;olute power, but declared &s;he would accept the crown upon no other condition than that of election. In con&s;equence of this welcome inti|mation, the &s;tates declared the throne vacant, and then &s;he was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en their &s;overeign. This important mea&s;ure being taken, they &s;pent &s;ome time in &s;ettling the form of admini&s;tration, according to the antient con&s;titution. A motion was then made to a&s;&s;ociate with the queen her ma|je&s;ty's con&s;ort, the prince of He&s;&s;e; but this met with &s;uch oppo&s;ition, that it was thought proper to drop the &s;ubject. At the next meeting of the diet, however, the queen recommended her hu&s;|band to a &s;hare of the royal dignity, in a letter addre&s;&s;ed to each of the orders that compo&s;e the diet. A &s;elect committee was appointed to deli|berate on the propo&s;al; and violent di&s;putes ari&s;ing, her maje&s;ty wrote another letter to the &s;tates, &s;ig|nifying, that if any difficulty was made of ad|mitting her con&s;ort to a &s;hare of the throne, &s;he was willing to re&s;ign the whole in his favour. At the &s;ame time the prince &s;ent a remon&s;trance to each order, declaring, that &s;hould they think pro|per to ve&s;t him with the royal dignity, he would
<PB N="233" REF="2450">
confirm and ratify whatever re&s;trictions and limita|tions they &s;hould propo&s;e: that he would conform to the national church, and inviolably maintain its di&s;cipline as by law e&s;tabli&s;hed: that as he had ad|vi&s;ed the queen to renounce all preten&s;ions to ab&s;o|lute power, &s;o he would faithfully ob&s;erve all the rules pre&s;cribed by the form of regency e&s;tabli&s;hed in the la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion: that he would tran&s;act nothing relating to Swedi&s;h affairs, without the advice and approbation of Swedi&s;h coun&s;ellors: that he would promote no foreigners to any employment, either civil or military: that he would encourage com|merce, and exert all his endeavours for the glory and advantage of the Swedi&s;h nation.</P>
<P>The &s;tates immediately re&s;olved to acquie&s;ce in the queen's reque&s;t; and this re&s;olution was inti|mated to her maje&s;ty by a &s;elect committee of each order. The prince was accordingly cho&s;en king of Sweden, and the act of election pre&s;ented to him by a deputation of the &s;tates, in pre&s;ence of all the foreign mini&s;ters. His royal highne&s;s had previou&s;ly &s;igned an in&s;trument, in which he &s;o|lemnly promi&s;ed to ob&s;erve inviolably the condi|tions on which he was rai&s;ed to the throne. Having heard the act of election recited, he was pre&s;ented with the &s;ceptre by count Horn, &s;peaker of the hou&s;e of nobles, at the head of the committee. His maje&s;ty forthwith re&s;tored the &s;ceptre, and made a &s;hort &s;peech on the occa&s;ion. He recapi|tulated the promi&s;es he had already made, and a&s;&s;ured them he would endeavour to live with them not only as their king, but as their friend and brother.</P>
<P>At this period Sweden was involved in a dan|gerous war with all its neighbours: but the new king in a little time concluded three different trea|ties of peace; one with Denmark, another with Pru&s;&s;ia; and a third with the czar of Mu&s;covy. In
<PB N="234" REF="2460">
con&s;equence of the&s;e treaties, the Swedes recovered part of Pomerania, and the town of Wi&s;mar; but his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty retained the dutchy of Stetin: while tho&s;e of Bremen and Verden were left in the hands of the elector of Hanover; and the Czar kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all his conque&s;ts. In the year 1720, the kings of Sweden and Poland were re|conciled.</P>
<P>Thus the crown of Sweden, from being the mo&s;t ab&s;olute, became the mo&s;t limited in Europe; and the e&s;tates recovered all their former power and privileges. Though they &s;ettled the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion upon the heirs male of the queen; yet they &s;tipu|lated, that no prince &s;hould a&s;cend the throne, un|til he &s;hould have attained the age of twenty-one, given his &s;olemn a&s;&s;urance in the a&s;&s;embly of the e&s;tates, and taken the oaths which the law of Swe|den pre&s;cribes. They even re&s;erved to them&s;elves the power of appointing governors and preceptors, to &s;uperintend the education of the prince de&s;tined to wield the &s;ceptre of their government. In a word, the king of Sweden is no more than the fir&s;t magi&s;trate of the kingdom, re&s;tricted by the law, and depending on the diet. He can levy neither toll, tax, nor &s;oldier; engage in war, conclude peace, nor pa&s;s the frontiers, without the know|ledge and approbation of the &s;tates. All the great officers of the &s;tate are appointed by the diet. All con&s;iderable employments, whether eccle&s;ia&s;tical, civil, or military, are conferred by the king, with the approbation of the &s;enate. The e&s;tates of Sweden are compo&s;ed of deputies, that repre&s;ent the four different orders; the nobility, clergy, burghers, and pea&s;ants. The&s;e are cho&s;en by the different bodies, of which they are the repre&s;en|tatives. With tho&s;e of the nobility, con&s;i&s;ting of one member out of every family, are a&s;&s;ociated the colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, and &s;enior cap|tain
<PB N="235" REF="2470">
of each regiment in the &s;ervice. The clergy is repre&s;ented by the bi&s;hops and &s;uperintendants, and one member from each rural deanery, or ten pari&s;hes, maintained at the charge of his electors. The repre&s;entatives of the burghers are elected by the magi&s;trates and council of every corporation. Stockholm, the capital, &s;ends four members to the diet: other towns have the privilege of chu&s;ing two repre&s;entatives each, and &s;ome can &s;end one only. The pea&s;ants of each di&s;trict elect a mem|ber of their own order, whom they in&s;truct with re&s;pect to the redre&s;s of grievances, and maintain during the &s;e&s;&s;ion. The repre&s;entatives of the no|bility may amount in number to one thou&s;and; tho&s;e of the clergy to two hundred; the burghers to about one hundred and fifty; and the pea&s;ants to two hundred and fifty. They are a&s;&s;embled in con&s;equence of the king's letters to the governors of provinces and the bi&s;hops. They meet in a large hall of the ca&s;tle of Stockholm, where his maje&s;ty is &s;eated on the throne. Here the &s;ecretary communicates the king's propo&s;als, makes them acquainted with the &s;tate of affairs, and informs them of the occa&s;ion of their pre&s;ent meeting. To the&s;e propo&s;itions di&s;tinct an&s;wers are made by the mar&s;hal of the nobility, in behalf of that order; by the archbi&s;hop for the clergy, the fir&s;t burgoma&s;ter of Stockholm for the burghers, and by one of the pea&s;ants for his brethren. The mar&s;hal of the diet, or &s;peaker of the upper hou&s;e, is cho&s;en by the nobility; and every other order nominates its own orator. Then they &s;eparate into four different hou&s;es, and each order chu&s;es a &s;ecret committee for di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, which, from time to time, receives directions and information from the mini|&s;try. Every point in debate is decided by a ma|jority in each hou&s;e; and the four orders mu&s;t be unanimous, otherwi&s;e the affair is left unfini&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="2480">
The king's propo&s;itions being con&s;idered and di&s;cu&s;&s;ed, each body or hou&s;e pre&s;ents a detail of its grievances, to which his maje&s;ty returns a par|ticular an&s;wer, of which an authentic copy is deli|vered to every member of the three inferior orders. This, together with a written account of the diet's re&s;olutions, he carries home to his electors. Every order elects its own orator at the beginning of the &s;e&s;&s;ion; and each is provided with a &s;ecretary, to record the tran&s;action. Every deputy mu&s;t be turned of four and twenty: during the &s;e&s;&s;ion his per&s;on is &s;acred from arre&s;t, unle&s;s he be di&s;covered in the commi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome flagrant crime; and, even in that ca&s;e, intimation mu&s;t be immediately given to the diet. Any per&s;on who a&s;&s;aults and mal-treats a member, either in going to, or in re|turning from the diet, is liable to be puni&s;hed, as having committed a capital crime.</P>
<P>In con&s;equence of the ordinance or con&s;titution e&s;tabli&s;hed in the year 1723, the diet is to a&s;&s;emble every three years in the month of January, or oftener, if they &s;hould be convoked by the king, with the advice of the &s;enate; or if they them|&s;elves &s;hould have fixed a &s;horter day at their la&s;t &s;itting. If the king is either ab&s;ent from the realm, indi&s;po&s;ed, or decea&s;ed, or &s;ome other un|fore&s;een event happens, in which the pro&s;perity of the kingdom and the liberty of the e&s;tates are in|tere&s;ted, then the &s;enate has a right to a&s;&s;emble the diet. If neither the king nor the &s;enate &s;hould a&s;&s;emble the &s;tates by the u&s;ual time, and no writ of &s;ummons appears by the fifteenth day of No|vember, in that ca&s;e the governor of Stockholm, and the bailiffs of the provinces, mu&s;t give notice that the diet may, by its own authority, a&s;&s;emble at Stockholm by the middle of January. Should the throne become vacant by the death of the reigning prince, this event mu&s;t be forthwith com|municated
<PB N="237" REF="2490">
to all concerned by the admini&s;trators of the higher hou&s;e, the con&s;i&s;tory of Up&s;al, and the magi&s;trates of Stockholm: at the &s;ame time the bailiffs are obliged, under &s;evere penalties, to &s;end expre&s;s notice of it through all parts of their re&s;pective bailiages, or governments, that a &s;uffi|cient number of deputies may be forthwith a&s;&s;em|bled, for the immediate protection of the liberty of the kingdom, until the more di&s;tant members ar|rive and complete the diet, which mu&s;t imme|diately deliberate upon a new election. In the mean time the &s;enate mu&s;t pitch upon &s;ome place, at a di&s;tance from Stockholm, where the foreign mini&s;ters and their families may re&s;ide during the election.</P>
<P>The e&s;tates of Sweden regulate every thing of importance that relates to the admini&s;tration, and take cognizance of every circum&s;tance in which the welfare and advantage of the community is intere&s;ted. The &s;e&s;&s;ion cannot continue longer than three months; but it may break up &s;ooner, if all the different orders con&s;ent to the &s;eparation. In that ca&s;e the mar&s;hal of the nobility, and the &s;peakers of the other orders, wait upon the king, and de&s;ire he would convene and di&s;mi&s;s the dif|ferent bodies that compo&s;e the diet. They are ac|cordingly a&s;&s;embled before his maje&s;ty in the great hall of the e&s;tates, where, after the mar&s;hal and the other &s;peakers have &s;everally thanked him for his care and attention to the public weal, and pro|mi&s;ed to &s;erve him with the mo&s;t zealous and loyal affection, the re&s;olutions of the diet are recited: then the king him&s;elf, or the pre&s;ident of the chancery in his name, &s;ignifies his maje&s;ty's appro|bation of what has been concluded; promi&s;es the continuance of his favour to the e&s;tates, and of his care and attention for the advantage of his people;
<PB N="238" REF="2500">
and, finally, di&s;mi&s;&s;es the diet, wi&s;hing all the de|puties a happy return to their &s;everal habitations. Neverthele&s;s, before they di&s;per&s;e, each order &s;ends a deputation to take leave of the king and the royal family.</P>
<P>Next to the diet, the &s;enate of Sweden de&s;erves our con&s;ideration. The members of this venerable body are cho&s;en in the following manner: the knights and nobility appoint a deputation of four and twenty individuals: twelve are &s;ent by the clergy, and the like number by the burghers. The&s;e joining together, and taking an oath of &s;e|crecy, con&s;ult, deliberate, and pitch upon &s;uch a number of per&s;ons, that there &s;hall be three pre|&s;ented, every way capable of, and qualified for fill|ing the vacant &s;eats of &s;enators. The&s;e, being ap|proved by the different orders of the diet, are recommended to the king, who, by his own au|thority, fills the vacant &s;eat with one of the three who have been thus pre&s;ented. The &s;enate is com|po&s;ed of &s;ixteen members, be&s;ides the chief go|vernors of the provinces, including always the pre&s;ident of the chancery, and the grand mar&s;hal; and out of the&s;e are cho&s;en the pre&s;idents of the courts of ju&s;tice and colleges, as well as that of the grand governor. In the &s;enate there mu&s;t not be above two brothers, or two per&s;ons of the &s;ame family. In a word, the &s;enate is the great council, by the help of which the king manages the reins of government. The &s;enate not only acts as coun|cil to his maje&s;ty, but al&s;o as a check upon the prerogative, and a re&s;ource to the people, who conceive them&s;elves aggrieved by &s;entences pro|nounced in different courts of judicature. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of the &s;enate to watch, to fore&s;ee, and prevent every intrigue or enterprize tending to the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of ab&s;olute monarchy, and the
<PB N="239" REF="2510">
diminution of the privileges enjoyed by the e&s;tates of the kingdom. Each &s;enator is re&s;pon&s;ible to the diet, and obliged to give an account of his conduct, relating to every affair in which his ad|vice or vote was given.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ence of &s;even or more members con&s;titutes a &s;enate, for what is called the Revi&s;ion of Ju&s;tice. This comprehends their deliberations and re&s;olu|tions, touching every object that regards the &s;ervice of the king and of the &s;tate, &s;uppo&s;ed to be in&s;epar|able. When the voices on each &s;ide are equal in the revi&s;ion of ju&s;tice, or when there is only a majority of two, the king ca&s;ts the ballance by his acce&s;&s;ion to either party. When the king is ab&s;ent, or &s;o indi&s;|po&s;ed that he cannot as u&s;ual bear the burthen of the admini&s;tration, the management of the helm de|volves to the &s;enate, in which every thing is carried by a plurality of voices; and, in ca&s;e of equality, the ca&s;ting vote is ve&s;ted in the per&s;on of the olde&s;t &s;enator. The &s;enate, in like manner, takes charge of the admini&s;tration until the diet can be a&s;&s;em|bled, when the throne becomes vacant by the death of the reigning prince, in ca&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion be not previou&s;ly &s;ettled. One half of the &s;enate is always employed in the revi&s;ion of &s;entences, the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, and the regulation of foreign affairs: the other half is occupied with matters of le&s;s importance.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e &s;enators who are pre&s;idents for life of the colleges, are obliged to attend daily in their re&s;pective offices for di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s. The great governor regulates the whole police of the city of Stockholm: the pre&s;ident of the college of chancery, however, is exempted from &s;itting in that college: on the con|trary, he is obliged to give his daily attendance in the &s;enate. Such members al&s;o as do not &s;it in the revi&s;ion of ju&s;tice, or in the colleges, mu&s;t attend in the &s;enate, to take cognizance of all affairs pro|po&s;ed
<PB N="240" REF="2520">
by the &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, of war, and of foreign affairs, in concurrence with his maje&s;ty: but in matters of great con&s;equence, &s;uch as the maintenance of fortifications, the conclu&s;ion of a peace, truce, or alliance, preparations for war by land or by &s;ea, the nomination to the chief offices of the &s;tate, the choice of deputies and mini&s;ters, and the regulation of the national finances; the king takes the advice of the whole &s;enate, a&s;&s;em|bled for the&s;e purpo&s;es. All offices of importance are conferred by the king, with the advice of the &s;enate, or in con&s;equence of a pre&s;entation from the different colleges, who enjoy this privilege: but, after all, there is a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s left to the deliberation of the king him&s;elf, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by two &s;enators, cho&s;en in their turn for this purpo&s;e. The&s;e likewi&s;e attend the king in all his journeys and excur&s;ions: but neither the pre&s;idents of the chancery, the colleges, and the courts of ju&s;tice, nor the grand governor of Stockholm, can be of this number.</P>
<P>For the more ea&s;y management of the admini&s;|tration, and the more di&s;tinct di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s, there are certain colleges e&s;tabli&s;hed in Sweden, to act under the king's commi&s;&s;ion, with full power to &s;ummon, to command and govern all tho&s;e that appertain to their re&s;pective departments, and to &s;upply his maje&s;ty with all nece&s;&s;ary informations. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is the college of war, con&s;i&s;ting of a pre&s;ident, a great ma&s;ter of the artillery, a quarter-ma&s;ter-general, four coun&s;ellors, in time of war, and two in peace, employed in making calcu|lations, and &s;ettling accompts. This college ma|nages the concerns of the army, the ordnance, forts, and garri&s;ons, founderies, armouries, ammunition, the levies, reviews, and cloathing of regiments: but the payment of them is a province belonging to another office, under the in&s;pection of the chamber
<PB N="241" REF="2530">
of finances. The college of admiralty, con&s;i&s;ting of a pre&s;ident, with all the admirals and &s;ea-com|manders that are a&s;hore, as his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, holds its &s;e&s;&s;ions at Carl&s;crone, a town in the province of Blekinge, on the Baltic. This board regulates every thing relating to the navy; the building of &s;hips and galliots, the levy, provi&s;ion and pay of the mariners, the arms, cannon, and ammunition u&s;ed in the &s;ea-&s;ervice. The&s;e expences are de|frayed from the trea&s;ury of the admiralty, and the pay-office is accountable to the chamber of finances. The next college is the chancery of the kingdom, in which one of the &s;enators always pre&s;ides, with another member of the &s;enate, a chancellor of the court, three &s;ecretaries of &s;tate, and four coun&s;el|lors of the chancery, for his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors. In this col|lege, all edicts, ordinances, and records concern|ing the kingdom in general, and the particular privileges of certain towns or per&s;ons, their let|ters patent, orders and in&s;tructions, are drawn up and expedited. To this board al&s;o belong the memorials and documents of diets and a&s;|&s;emblies, alliances with foreign powers, treaties of peace; the pre&s;entation and in&s;tructions of en|voys; and the care of giving audience to foreign mini&s;ters. Here are regi&s;tered the re&s;olutions taken by the king, with the advice of the &s;enate, and here are i&s;&s;ued all the acts that pa&s;s in the name and &s;ignature of his maje&s;ty. This college, more|over, regulates all the po&s;ts throughout the king|dom, and maintains them in good order under the in&s;pection of a po&s;tma&s;ter general. The bu&s;ine&s;s is divided into three different departments allotted to the three &s;ecretaries. One takes cognizance of foreign affairs: the province of another is war; and the third manages the interior bu&s;ine&s;s of the king|dom. If any of the&s;e &s;hould be found acting ac|cording to the king's private in&s;tructions, without

the concurrence of the &s;enate, he would not only forfeit his place, but be puni&s;hed with the utmo&s;t &s;everity. No per&s;ons are admitted to places in the chancery, but &s;uch as have given unque&s;tionable proofs of their under&s;tanding, diligence, and ca|pacity.</P>
<P>The chamber of finances, compo&s;ed of a pre&s;i|dent and four ordinary coun&s;ellors, i&s;&s;ues orders and directions to all tho&s;e who have any concern with the revenue. It is likewi&s;e the province of this board to collect the revenues, and augment them occa&s;ionally; to encourage agriculture; to take e&s;pecial care that the e&s;tates and deme&s;nes, known by the name of <HI>Regalia Fi&s;ci,</HI> &s;hall not be pillaged or neglected, but duly improved; that the public money &s;hall be collected in good time, frugally managed, and faithfully applied; and that the public credit &s;hall be punctually maintained. The cu&s;toms, duties, and exci&s;e, are &s;ubjected to the care and management of directors appointed for that purpo&s;e, under the in&s;pection of this cham|ber, which may be denominated a board of trea|&s;ury. But it belongs to the State-office, another college, con&s;i&s;ting of a pre&s;ident and two commi&s;|&s;ioners, to i&s;&s;ue out the public money for the dif|ferent applications; to pay the &s;everal officers who receive their appointments from the trea&s;ury, and to keep a regular accompt of all the&s;e di&s;bur&s;e|ments. Here is re&s;erved a certain &s;um, to be at the private di&s;po&s;al of his maje&s;ty, as well as an|other &s;um, of which he may di&s;po&s;e, with the ad|vice of the &s;enate.</P>
<P>The college of the mines is con&s;tituted of a pre&s;ident, two coun&s;ellors, and four a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, who, by their knowledge and experience, are not only enabled to perform the office of judges, but are likewi&s;e &s;killed in all the different branches of me|tallurgy. This is a board of great importance,
<PB N="243" REF="2550">
ina&s;much as upon the conduct of the miners the foreign trade of Sweden in a great mea&s;ure de|pends. Their province is to take every fea&s;ible &s;tep for the maintenance and improvement of the mining works of the kingdom; and they are au|thorized to try and decide all cau&s;es that may be appealed to them from the inferior courts of the mines, the judges of which courts are under their immediate juri&s;diction.</P>
<P>The college of commerce is compo&s;ed of a pre|&s;ident, two coun&s;ellors of trade, four a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors per|fectly well acquainted with all the branches of traf|fick, and two commi&s;&s;ioners. In all important af|fairs, concerning commerce, this college is obliged, either directly, or by the intervention of the ma|gi&s;trates, to con&s;ult the principal burghers, traders, and manufacturers in all the great towns of the kingdom, before any re&s;olution can be taken. The members of this board mu&s;t take every nece&s;|&s;ary &s;tep for extending the commerce of the king|dom, for improving, e&s;tabli&s;hing, and maintaining manufactures; and for the vigorous execution of all the regulations and ordinances touching the duties and cu&s;toms which have been impo&s;ed by the diet.</P>
<P>All the&s;e colleges are obliged to produce before the diet, during every &s;e&s;&s;ion, a complete detail of what has pa&s;&s;ed in their &s;everal departments; and all tho&s;e who depend upon the colleges, &s;uch as the governors-general, the grand governor, the bai|liffs, colonels, and others, mu&s;t give an account of their conduct as often as it &s;hall be required by their &s;uperiors.</P>
<P>The great mar&s;hal is a member of the &s;enate, ve&s;ted with the charge of every thing that concerns the court, the palace, and king's hou&s;hold. The grand governor's province is to have a watchful eye over the ca&s;tle, and the king's hou&s;hold within

<HEAD>The General CHARACTER, MANNERS, and CUSTOMS of the SWEDES.</HEAD>
<P>The people of Sweden, from the &s;everity of their air, the poorne&s;s of their food, and the bar|renne&s;s of their country, are generally &s;trong, hardy, patient of labour and fatigue; and, in all re&s;pects, well qualified to perform the duties of a military life; in&s;omuch that the Swedes have, at many different aeras, been reputed the be&s;t &s;oldiers in Chri&s;tendom: yet, with all their courage and per&s;everance, they are &s;low and phlegmatic, and make a much better figure in the day of battle than in the conduct of a campaign. With re&s;pect to their mental faculties, they are &s;aid to be &s;low of comprehen&s;ion, and of narrow capacity. They are very little troubled with the &s;pirit of inquiry, and &s;eldom amu&s;e them&s;elves in the regions of &s;peculative philo&s;ophy. To this want of curio&s;ity is originally owing that unanimity in religion, pro|ductive of &s;uch happy con&s;equences to the com|monwealth. What the Swedes want in genius, they make up by an uncommon exertion of in|du&s;try and application. Tho&s;e that are employed in the admini&s;tration have, by dint of indefatigable &s;tudy, acquired a perfect knowledge of the bu&s;i|ne&s;s in which they are engaged. The nation has pro|duced many excellent &s;tate&s;men, and &s;ome learned men; at the head of which cla&s;s &s;tand the cele|brated Puffendorf, hi&s;torian, civilian, and philo|&s;opher; and of our days the famous Linnaeus, the prince of botani&s;ts, and one of the be&s;t natu|rali&s;ts now alive. No country in Europe has been more productive than Sweden of great generals, both &s;overeigns and &s;ubjects. Gu&s;tavus Eric&s;on,
<PB N="246" REF="2580">
Gu&s;tavus Adolphus, Charles Gu&s;tavus, and Charles XII. have left immortal monuments of military fame.</P>
<P>The nobility of Sweden are brave, ho&s;pitable, fond of glory, and &s;crupulou&s;ly ob&s;ervant of the punctilios of honour: at the &s;ame it mu&s;t be owned they are proud, o&s;tentatious, jealous, and vindictive. The common people are quiet and indu&s;trious, &s;ober, loyal, and religious; yet furious and ungovernable when intoxicated. They live in great poverty, and rudely practi&s;e &s;everal me|chanical arts, which nece&s;&s;ity teaches them to exer|ci&s;e: for example, the pea&s;ants make their own &s;hoes, cloaths, tools, and in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry. The trading part of the nation plod on in a beaten track, without ingenuity to di&s;cover, or &s;pirit to pur&s;ue, new branches of commerce; notwith&s;tand|ing all the care and encouragement be&s;towed by the legi&s;lature. They are &s;aid to be over-reaching, rapacious, envious, and extremely aver&s;e to fo|reigners. Heretofore no per&s;on of family would conde&s;cend to exerci&s;e any of the learned profe&s;|&s;ions, or even to take the command of a trading ve&s;&s;el: but the&s;e ridiculous prejudices are wearing out a-pace.</P>
<P>Marriages in Sweden are generally founded on mercenary motives of parents, without, in the lea&s;t, con&s;ulting the inclinations of the parties them&s;elves. The children of noble families are often turned of thirty before their marriage, be|cau&s;e the parents are &s;eldom in a condition to part with any part of their own fortunes in their life|time. The women are generally fair, and well|&s;haped, reputed more eminent for cha&s;tity before, than for fidelity after wedlock. They are very fruitful; and, from the highe&s;t to the lowe&s;t, kept by their hu&s;bands under &s;uch authority, as would be deemed oppre&s;&s;ion in France or England. The
<PB N="247" REF="2590">
meaner &s;ort, be&s;ides the offices peculiar to their &s;ex, &s;toop to all &s;orts of drudgery. They plow the fields, thre&s;h the corn, row in boats, and carry burdens. In wedding, as well as in funeral enter|tainments, the Swedes affect pomp and &s;uperfluity, and both are commonly attended with riot and ex|ce&s;s. The Swedes are, in general, of a large &s;ta|ture, with white or yellow hair. Per&s;ons of fa&s;hion are dre&s;&s;ed in the French mode: and the com|monalty here, as in Denmark, wear cloaths made of coar&s;e &s;tuff, lined with &s;heep-&s;kin, to &s;creen them from the winter's cold. Their diver&s;ions are likewi&s;e the &s;ame with tho&s;e of their neighbours, namely, &s;kating, running races in &s;ledges, and even &s;ailing in yachts upon the ice; exerci&s;es which they perform with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s and dexterity.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>UNIVERSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Though learning has been but of little e&s;teem among this warlike people, they have not been altogether without &s;eminaries, even in antient times. The univer&s;ity at Up&s;al was in&s;tituted near four hundred years ago, and patronized by &s;everal &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ive monarchs, particularly by the great Gu&s;ta|vus Adolphus, and his daughter queen Chri&s;tina, who piqued her&s;elf upon being the patrone&s;s of learning. It con&s;i&s;ts of a chancellor, a vice-chan|cellor, a rector, and twenty profe&s;&s;ors, provided with comfortable &s;alaries. The number of &s;tudents u&s;ed to amount to &s;even or eight hundred, fifty of whom are maintained by the king. There is an|other univer&s;ity at Abo in Finland, but not &s;o well endowed, nor &s;o flouri&s;hing: and there was a third at Lunden in Schonen, which is now fallen into decay. Every dioce&s;e is provided with a free|&s;chool, in which boys are qualified for &s;he univer|&s;ity, as well as with inferior &s;chools, where chil|dren
<PB N="248" REF="2600">
are taught to read, write, and &s;ing their prayers. But the provi&s;ion for the poor in Swe|den is very &s;canty: there are not above five or &s;ix ho&s;pitals in the whole kingdom, be&s;ides a little alms-hou&s;e in each pari&s;h, maintained by the cha|rity of the inhabitants.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The trade of Sweden depends chiefly on its mines, and its manufactures of iron, hard-ware, bra&s;s, and copper. The&s;e metals they export, both wrought and unwrought; together with great quantities of timber, ma&s;ts, and deal-boards, pitch, tar, naval &s;tores, and even &s;hips ready built and rigged. They carry on with England a very con|&s;iderable traffick for &s;ome of the&s;e articles, which might be &s;upplied as well from the Briti&s;h planta|tions; and in that ca&s;e the nation would &s;ave a very large ballance of money, which is now payed to Sweden. The parliament of England, aware of this di&s;advantage, has lately enacted a law, per|mitting pig-iron to be imported duty free to any part of Great Britain, and even bar-iron to be im|ported into London: but, notwith&s;tanding this indulgence, the ballance of trade continues &s;till greatly in favour of Sweden. This kingdom, in exchange for its own produce, receives cloths from England; &s;ugars, wines, and &s;ilk from France; and &s;pices from the Dutch; and manages its ad|vantages &s;o ill, that, upon the whole, the imports exceed the exports in value.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>STRENGTH.</HEAD>
<P>The kingdom of Sweden is in little or no dan|ger from the power of the &s;tanding army, which, indeed, is no other than a well regulated militia, under the immediate command of freeholders,
<PB N="249" REF="2610">
who&s;e intere&s;t is intimately connected with the liberty of their fellow-&s;ubjects. The cavalry is rai&s;ed and maintained by the nobility and gentry, in proportion to the value of their e&s;tates, under &s;uch regulations, that neither man nor hor&s;e, after having been once li&s;ted in the &s;ervice, can be put to any other employment but tho&s;e &s;pecified in the&s;e regulations; and both mu&s;t be kept, with proper arms and equipage, in continual readine&s;s for &s;ervice. The infantry is maintained at the ex|pence of the yeomen. Every farm, amounting in value to &s;eventy pounds &s;terling a year, is charged with one foot-&s;oldier, who is either &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, cloathed with ordinary dre&s;s, and payed by the farmer, or lives with his family in a little wooden hou&s;e, built by his landlord; who, moreover, cul|tivates for him as much ground as will &s;upply him with bread, and furni&s;hes him with a &s;ufficient quantity of hay and pa&s;turage for the maintenance of one cow. The officers, both of the hor&s;e and infantry, live upon certain lands appropriated by the public for that purpo&s;e. Every officer is pro|vided with a neat convenient hou&s;e, &s;ituated in that part of the country where his regiment is quar|tered, together with a competent portion of ground for his own u&s;e, and his pay ari&s;es from the rent of neighbouring farms; &s;o that he receives it punc|tually in money, corn, or other commodities, and lives upon the footing of a country gentleman. A colonel of infantry enjoys, in this manner, an e&s;tate of about three hundred pounds <HI>per annum;</HI> and the inferior officers are accommodated with pro|portionable appointments. The uniform cloath|ing of the troops is defrayed from the public trea|&s;ury. Every officer, upon his removal or promo|tion, is obliged to leave his hou&s;e and farm in as good condition as that in which he found it; and for this purpo&s;e he &s;ub&s;cribes an inventory, when
<PB N="250" REF="2620">
he fir&s;t takes po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. In time of peace the civil magi&s;trate takes cognizance of all crimes and tre&s;|pa&s;&s;es committed by the &s;oldiery; but in camp and garri&s;on they are &s;ubject to martial law. Every company is exerci&s;ed once a month; and every regiment reviewed twice or thrice in a year: on the&s;e occa&s;ions only they wear the king's cloaths, which, when the &s;ervice is over, are carefully depo|&s;ited in the churches. Thus the army is part of the con&s;titution: the officers are landholders, and generally men of good families. They and their &s;oldiers derive their property from the con&s;titution, which therefore they will the more zealou&s;ly defend again&s;t all the incroachments of arbitrary power, and &s;ini&s;ter influence.</P>
<P>The land-forces of Sweden may amount to about forty thou&s;and men, hor&s;e and foot. For maimed, infirm, and &s;uperannuated &s;oldiers, there is one general ho&s;pital, well endowed; the reve|nue of which is con&s;iderably reinforced by a cer|tain gratuity paid to it by every officer, when he is promoted in the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>The Swedi&s;h navy con&s;i&s;ts of forty &s;ail of the line of battle; but neither &s;hips nor docks are kept in proper order and repair.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the arms con&s;tantly u&s;ed by the &s;oldiery, there is a con&s;iderable magazine at Stockholm, and another in the ca&s;tle of Jencoping, near the frontiers of Denmark. The&s;e are &s;upplied from a con&s;iderable iron-work at Oerbro in Nericia. In this ca&s;tle too, which is one of the few inland for|tre&s;&s;es of Sweden, there is a fine train of artillery, kept always ready for &s;ervice. On the borders of Norway there are &s;ome &s;mall forts, that defend the pa&s;&s;es of the mountains. The city of Gotten|burgh, the town of Maer&s;trand, and the ca&s;tle of Elf&s;burg, are tolerably well fortified. Waerburgh, Helm&s;tadt, Land&s;crone, and Malmo, near the Da|ni&s;h
<PB N="251" REF="2630">
borders, are places of good defence; as are Carle&s;crone and Calmar on the Baltic, with two &s;mall forts at the entrance of the river leading to Stockholm.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUE, and COIN.</HEAD>
<P>The revenue of Sweden, ari&s;ing from crown|lands, poll-money, tythes, &s;ilver, copper, and iron|mines, proceedings at law, and other more incon|&s;iderable articles, formerly amounted to a million &s;terling yearly. Of this about one third was de|rived from the produce of the lands, and almo&s;t one fourth from the cu&s;toms. The poll-tax is impo&s;ed on the pea&s;ants only: every individual of that cla&s;s above &s;ixteen, and under &s;ixty, pays about twelve pence a year. The revenue of Swe|den has been con&s;iderably le&s;&s;ened by the unfor|tunate events of the war maintained by Charles XII. as well as of that which was lately carried on again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia. Neverthele&s;s, the expences of the &s;tate have been dimini&s;hed in the &s;ame pro|portion; and while the finances are regularly and frugally managed, they will be found &s;ufficient to maintain the government in a re&s;pectable condi|tion, without any reinforcement of foreign &s;ub&s;i|dies.</P>
<P>The current coin of Sweden con&s;i&s;ts of gold ducats, eight-mark pieces of &s;ilver, valued each at five &s;hillings and two pence; four-mark pieces, and copper coins of different &s;ize and value: &s;ome of the&s;e are as large as tiles, and, when payments are made in this &s;pecies, the merchant is often obliged to receive them in a cart or wheel-barrow.</P>

<HEAD>INTEREST and POLITICKS of SWEDEN.</HEAD>
<P>It is undoubtedly the intere&s;t of Sweden to live on terms of friend&s;hip with all her neighbours; to improve her internal advantages, extend her trade, and cultivate a good under&s;tanding with the Mari|time Powers, which, by &s;ending &s;quadrons into the Baltic, are always able to defend her from the de&s;igns of Ru&s;&s;ia, her neare&s;t and mo&s;t formidable rival.

<P>In the year 1739, a French &s;quadron arrived at Stockholm, under the command of the duc d'An|tin. <Q>Being favoured with an audience, the king pre&s;ented him with his own &s;word, &s;aying, &startq;This, Sir, I give you with the greater plea&s;ure, as I am certain you will draw it on all occa&s;ions for our defence; and I and my &s;ubjects will draw our &s;words for the intere&s;t and glory of France.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The de&s;ign of the French mini&s;try was to in&s;ti|gate the Swedes again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia: for this purpo&s;e they employed all the arts which that crown has &s;o long practi&s;ed, as the common di&s;turber of Eu|rope, to embroil one nation with another. They, by their emi&s;&s;aries, &s;oothed, flattered, promi&s;ed, and inflamed. They &s;cattered gold among the mini&s;ters, and granted &s;ub&s;idies to the crown. Their endeavours at length produced an univer&s;al clamour again&s;t Ru&s;&s;ia, and the nation ran head|long into a war, which was unfortunate and inglo|rious. All the country of Finland was lo&s;t, and the greater part of their army taken pri&s;oners, by an enemy whom, in former times, they had &s;o often defeated.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="2650">
In the mid&s;t of the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters the diet re&s;olved to &s;ettle the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as the reigning king had no i&s;&s;ue. The duke of Hol&s;tein-Gottorp, prince Frederick of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, nephew to the king, the prince of Denmark, and the duke of Deux|points, were the four competitors. After warm debates, the duke of Hol&s;tein was declared &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or by a majority of two votes only. But this prince had already embraced the Greek religion, with a view to the throne of Ru&s;&s;ia; the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to which was &s;ettled upon him accordingly. He promi&s;ed, however, to re&s;ign his preten&s;ions to the crown of Sweden in favour of his uncle prince Adolphus Frederick, admini&s;trator of Hol&s;tein and bi&s;hop of Lubeck. In con&s;equence of this pro|po&s;al, the conferences for peace, which had been interrupted, were renewed at Abo, under the me|diation of his Britannic maje&s;ty. By the treaty of peace, which was in a little time concluded, Ru&s;&s;ia con&s;ented to re&s;tore all the conque&s;ts &s;he had made, except a &s;mall di&s;trict in Finland; and duke Adol|phus was declared hereditary prince, and &s;ucce&s;&s;or to the crown of Sweden. The pea&s;ants of Dale|karlia took arms, and rebelled again&s;t this di&s;po|&s;ition; but they were defeated and di&s;armed. The king of Denmark took umbrage at his &s;on's being excluded from the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and began to make preparations of war, as if he had intended by force of arms to overthrow the late e&s;tabli&s;hed &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in Sweden; but the Czarina giving him to under|&s;tand, that &s;he would maintain it with all her power, he thought proper to de&s;i&s;t. The prince &s;ucce&s;&s;or e&s;pou&s;ed the prince&s;s Loui&s;a Ulrica, &s;i&s;ter to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, with whom Sweden concluded a treaty, to which the court of France acceded. Count Gyllembourg and count Te&s;lin &s;oon gained the a&s;cendant over the mind of the &s;ucce&s;&s;or; and the French intere&s;t &s;till triumphed at Stockholm,
<PB N="254" REF="2660">
to the manife&s;t di&s;&s;atisfaction of the Czarina, and other powers, who endeavoured, though in vain, to detach him from that &s;y&s;tem of politicks. The old king, who had been for &s;ome time pa&s;&s;ive in the admini&s;iration, dying in the year 1751, the &s;ucce&s;&s;or a&s;cended the throne without oppo&s;ition, and immediately e&s;tabli&s;hed a good under&s;tanding with the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. Since that period a &s;trange revolution happened in the politicks of Europe. The rival hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Bourbon united, during the late war, with the Czarina in al|liances offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive again&s;t the king of Pru&s;&s;ia; and the French intere&s;t in Sweden, being thus reinforced, hurried that nation into the confe|deracy, even though their &s;overeign is &s;aid to have been aver&s;e to a rupture with his brother-in-law. The Swedes, however, met with very indifferent &s;ucce&s;s in their military efforts again&s;t his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty; and as they had never entered heartily into the war, readily acceded to the emperor of Ru&s;&s;ia's propo&s;al for a pacification with that monarch, in 1762. Since the conclu&s;ion of this treaty, they have applied them&s;elves with great diligence to the cultivation of a new di&s;covered fi&s;hery on their coa&s;ts.</P>

<HEAD>A DESCRIPTION OF THE PARTICULAR PARTS That compo&s;e the KINGDOM OF SWEDEN.</HEAD>
<P>THIS kingdom is con&s;tituted of Sweden, properly &s;o called, Gothland, Livonia, In|gria, Finland, Lapland, and divers i&s;lands in the Baltic. Sweden, properly &s;o called, is bounded on the &s;outh by Gothland, on the north by Lap|land, on the ea&s;t by the gulph of Bothnia, and on the we&s;t by the Norwegian mountains. It is &s;ub|divided into eleven parts, namely, Uplandia, Su|dermania, We&s;tmania, Nericia, Ge&s;tricia, Hel|&s;ingia, Dalekarlia, Midelpadia, Angermania, Jemp|tia, and We&s;t Bothnia.</P>
<P>Upland, or Uplandia, extends about &s;eventy|five miles from north to &s;outh, between the Baltic and Ge&s;tricia; from which la&s;t province it is &s;epa|rated by the river Dala. From ea&s;t to we&s;t it &s;tretches above &s;ixty miles, betwixt the Baltic and the province of We&s;tmania. The country is fer|tile, producing excellent wheat; and here are found mines of iron, lead, and &s;ilver; but this la&s;t in &s;mall quantity. The capital of this province, and indeed of the whole kingdom, is Stockholm, in Latin <HI>Holmia,</HI> which derives its name from <HI>Stock,</HI> wood, and <HI>holm,</HI> and i&s;land, alluding to the timber u&s;ed in building the city. It is &s;ituated on a clu&s;ter of &s;mall i&s;lands, and the hou&s;es are founded upon
<PB N="256" REF="2680">
piles. Including the two &s;uburbs, one of which &s;tands on the penin&s;ula of Toren, and the other in Athundria, the town is as large and populous as Bri&s;tol. Here the king u&s;ually re&s;ides; and here the e&s;tates always a&s;&s;emble. The i&s;land on which the greate&s;t part of Stockholm &s;tands, is &s;ur|rounded by two branches of a river, that runs with great rapidity out of the lake Maeler; and over each of the&s;e arms there is a wooden bridge: from the city the eye is regaled with the pro&s;pect of the lake on one &s;ide, and the &s;ea on the other. The &s;ea-water is here potable, the fre&s;hne&s;s being owing to the great quantity which the lake di&s;charges. The ca&s;tle, or palace, is a &s;pacious building, with|out ta&s;te or magnificence, furni&s;hing lodging-room not only to the royal family, but likewi&s;e to the greater part of the officers belonging to the hou&s;e|hold. It likewi&s;e comprehends the national or &s;upreme court of ju&s;tice, the colleges of war, chancery, trea&s;ury, and commerce; a chapel, ar|moury, library, and office for the public records: but the greater number of inferior officers and &s;ervants belonging to the court are, with the foot|guards, quartered on the burghers. The ca&s;tle, and all the &s;tately edifices in the kingdom, are covered with copper. The palace of the nobility, in which this order &s;its during the &s;e&s;&s;ion of the diet, is an elegant building, adorned on the out|&s;ide with marble &s;tatues and columns, and on the in&s;ide with painting and &s;culpture. This and three other palaces &s;tand on the banks of the lake, and are built on the &s;ame model, &s;o as to compo&s;e an uniform piece of architecture. The bank, built at the expence of the city, is a noble edifice, and joins with many &s;umptuous hou&s;es, belonging to the nobility, in exhibiting a &s;plendid appearance. The hou&s;es of the burghers are generally built of brick in the city; but in the &s;uburbs they are
<PB N="257" REF="2690">
commonly made up of timber, and therefore very &s;ubject to conflagrations. The&s;e hou&s;es are often framed in Finland, according to the plan and di|men&s;ions pre&s;cribed: from thence they are tran&s;|ported in pieces to Stockholm by water, and there &s;et up by the carpenters. The&s;e wooden habita|tions, if kept in proper repair, will la&s;t thirty or forty years, and are deemed warmer, neater, and more healthy than tho&s;e of brick or &s;tone. To prevent the danger of conflagrations, the city is divided into twelve wards. In each of the&s;e there is a ma&s;ter and four a&s;&s;i&s;tants, who forthwith re|pair to the place where the fire breaks out; and all porters and labourers are obliged to range them|&s;elves under the ma&s;ter of the ward to which they belong. A fire-watch patroles the &s;treets by night, to give warning or a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as it may be wanted; and a centinel is maintained in the &s;teeple of every church, to toll the bell on the fir&s;t appearance of any &s;uch accident. The police of Stockholm is intirely &s;ubjected to the regulations of the grand governor, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a deputy and bailiff of the ca&s;tle. There is an inferior juri&s;diction, compo&s;ed of four burgoma&s;ters, who &s;it with the coun&s;ellors of the city, to take care that ju&s;tice &s;hall be duly admini&s;tered; to take cognizance of every thing relating to the commerce, the police, and the pub|lic as well as private buildings of the city. The&s;e receive &s;alaries from the revenues of Stockholm, which likewi&s;e pays all its own officers and &s;er|vants, keeps all the public edifices in repair, and maintains a guard of three hundred mu&s;quereers. The&s;e expences are defrayed by a duty on all mer|chandize imported and exported, and a yearly tax upon the burghers, impo&s;ed by the magi&s;trates and common council. This city is the &s;taple of Sweden, to which all the commodities of the king|dom are brought for exportation, and where almo&s;t
<PB N="258" REF="2700">
all the imports from abroad are depo&s;ited. The port or haven formed by the lake Maeler, is large enough to contain a thou&s;and &s;ail of &s;hipping, and furni&s;hed with a key or wharf about an Engli&s;h mile in length, to which the ve&s;&s;els may lie with their broad&s;ides. The greate&s;t inconveniency at|tending this &s;ituation is the di&s;tance from the &s;ea, which is not within le&s;s than ten miles of the town, the want of tides, and winding of the river, which is remarkably crooked. It opens into the Baltic; and the entrance, which is dangerous and rocky, the Swedes have &s;ecured with two &s;mall forts: within it is perfectly &s;afe and commodious. The northern &s;uburbs are remarkable for the king's gardens, and for the great number of arti&s;ans who have cho&s;en their habitations in this quarter. In the &s;outhern &s;uburbs the Mu&s;covite commodities are &s;old; and here is a magnificent exchange, where the merchants daily a&s;&s;emble. The two warlike monarchs, Gu&s;tavus Adolphus and Charles Gu&s;tavus, are buried in chapels belonging to the church of Redderholm, which formerly belonged to the Cordeliers, and is &s;till known by the name of Cloo&s;ter-kirk.</P>
<P>Up&s;al, in Latin <HI>Up&s;alia,</HI> &s;tands on the banks of the river Sala, about two and forty miles to the north-we&s;t of Stockholm. It is a very antient city, heretofore capital of the kingdom, where the &s;o|vereigns u&s;ually re&s;ided. The town, which is large, &s;tands upon both &s;ides of the river, which is pretty broad, and &s;o hard frozen in the winter, that an annual fair is kept upon the ice in the month of February. The place is but indifferently fortified; but the cathedral is the mo&s;t magnificent church in the whole kingdom, covered with copper, and adorned with &s;everal royal monuments. The ca&s;tle &s;tands on a hill that commands the city. It is tolerably fortified, very &s;pacious, and elegantly
<PB N="259" REF="2710">
built in the Italian manner. Up&s;al was erected into a metropolitan &s;ee by pope Eugenius III. and the Roman catholic prelates of this archbi&s;hopric lived in great &s;plendour, never &s;tirring abroad without a retinue of five hundred hor&s;e. It was in the ca&s;tle of Up&s;al that queen Chri&s;tina abdi|cated the crown in the year 1654; and here Gu&s;|tavus I. a&s;&s;embled the e&s;tates, in order to aboli&s;h the Roman catholic religion. The univer&s;ity of this city has been already de&s;cribed. The other towns of note in Upland are the&s;e: Engkoping, in Latin <HI>Encopia,</HI> a place of &s;ome trade, on the lake Maeler, about five and twenty miles to the we&s;tward of Stockholm; O&s;thammar, Oregrund, Elfkarlby, Sal&s;tad, Sigtuna, Norr-talge, and Ro|torbo.</P>
<P>Sudermania, &s;eparated from Upland on the north by the lake Maeler, bounded on the &s;outh by Ea&s;t Gothland, on the we&s;t by Nericia, and by the Baltic on the ea&s;t, is a populous country, ex|tending &s;ixty miles in length, and forty-five in breadth, fruitful in corn, mines, and timber; of which la&s;t many &s;hips are built in this province. It is commonly &s;ubdivided into Sudermania, pro|perly &s;o called, and the i&s;land of Foren, formed by the lake Maeler, and Rekarne. The principal towns are Nicoping, or Nicopia, the capital, &s;tand|ing on the &s;hore of the Baltic, eight and forty miles to the &s;outhward of Stockholm, a place of &s;ome trade, with a commodious harbour, and a ca&s;tle, in which the dukes of Sudermania u&s;ed to re&s;ide; Strengne&s;s, in Latin <HI>Strengne&s;ia,</HI> a &s;mall town on the &s;outh &s;ide of the lake Maeler, the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan to the metropolitan of Up|&s;al. That the place is very antient appears from &s;ome Gothic in&s;criptions, found upon large &s;tones in the Runic character, importing, That heathen idols had been wor&s;hipped on that &s;pot, which
<PB N="260" REF="2720">
was likewi&s;e the &s;cene on which the warriors and wre&s;tlers of old exhibited proofs of their courage, &s;trength, and dexterity. King Charles IX. lies buried in the cathedral, which is an antient Gothic edifice. Oppo&s;ite to the town an annual fair is held upon the ice, when the lake Maeler is frozen. Tre&s;en, or Tro&s;a, &s;ituated on the Baltic, about forty miles from Stockholm, having the advantage of a good harbour: Telgen, or Soder-telga, a place of con&s;iderable commerce on the &s;outhern &s;ide of the lake Maeler, at the di&s;tance of twenty miles from Stockholm; and Tor&s;ilia, on the &s;ame &s;ide of the lake, about eighteen miles to the we&s;t|ward of Strengne&s;s.</P>
<P>The province of We&s;tmania, or We&s;tmanland, lying between Upland, Wermeland, Dalekarlia, part of Nericia, and part of Sudermania, is a bar|ren country, &s;tretching about ninety miles in length from &s;outh-ea&s;t to north-we&s;t, and about three&s;core miles in breadth from &s;outh to north. It was formerly con&s;iderable for its &s;ilver mines, which are now exhau&s;ted, or di&s;u&s;ed. The capital town of this province is Aro&s;en, or We&s;teras, in Latin <HI>Aro&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Ve&s;tera&s;ium,</HI> &s;ituated on the &s;ide of the lake Maeler, between Koping and Enkoping, about thirty-five miles from Stockholm. It is a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, rendered con&s;iderable by its ca&s;tle as well as by its &s;ituation. Here was concluded the hereditary union or convention in the year 1544, by which the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown of Sweden was &s;ettled in the family of Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a. Before this event the Danes had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the ca&s;tle; but that great prince, at the head of the Dalekarlians, defeated their army in this neigh|bourhood, and retook the fortre&s;s. Some other in&s;criptions are found in the cathedral of Aro&s;en. Among the other towns of this province we num|ber Arbogen, in Latin <HI>Arbogia,</HI> on the little river
<PB N="261" REF="2730">
Arbou, which falls into the lake Maeler, &s;ituated above &s;ixty miles to the we&s;tward of Stockholm. Koping, a &s;mall town between Aro&s;en and Ar|bogen, in the neighbourhood of which there are good mines of iron and copper: Nora, another &s;mall town, eight and twenty miles to the we&s;t|ward of Arbogen; and Linde&s;zas, an incon&s;ider|able place, built on the &s;ide of a rivulet, which lo&s;es it&s;elf in the lake Maeler. This town &s;tands to the ea&s;tward of the mountains, famous for the mines of Lindenberg.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict of Nericia, bounded on the north by We&s;tmania, on the ea&s;t by Sudermania, on the &s;outh by Ea&s;t Gothland and the northern extremity of the lake Vetter, and on the we&s;t partly by We&s;t Gothland, and partly by Wermeland, is remark|able for &s;everal large lakes and rivers; of which la&s;t the Tro&s;a divides the country in two parts from we&s;t to ea&s;t. Some &s;ilver mines have been for|merly dug in this province; but at pre&s;ent the in|habitants work none but tho&s;e of iron, alum, and &s;ulphur. The chief town is Orebro, in Latin <HI>Ore|brogia,</HI> built on the banks of the Tro&s;a, which here falls into the lake Hielmer, otherwi&s;e called the Yelmer Sea, about twenty miles to the &s;outh|we&s;t of Arbogen. The other places of any con|&s;equence are A&s;ker&s;und, on the northern extre|mity of the lake Vetter; Hillmer&s;berg, on the lake Hielmer; and Glan&s;hammer: the&s;e three are little towns of &s;mall importance.</P>
<P>The divi&s;ion of Ge&s;tricia, lying between the little river Tynea, the gulph of Bothnia, the river Dala, and Dalekarlia, is a barren country; yet productive of iron mines, and divided into two equal parts by the river Ha&s;unda. The chief town is Gevalia, or Gafle, at the mouth of that river, which forms a gulph that &s;erves as a harbour, by means of which the place enjoys a tolerable &s;hare
<PB N="262" REF="2740">
of trade. The other places of this province are Borna and Coperberget.</P>
<P>One of the mo&s;t exten&s;ive provinces of Sweden is Hel&s;ingia, or Hel&s;ingland, bounded on the north by Jemptia and Medelpadia, on the we&s;t and &s;outh|we&s;t by Dalekarlia, on the &s;outh by Ge&s;tricia, and on the ea&s;t by the gulph of Bothnia. The country is covered with mountains and fore&s;ts, and the in|habitants employ them&s;elves chiefly in hunting and fi&s;hing. The length of the province amounts to one hundred and thirty-&s;even miles from &s;outh|ea&s;t to north-we&s;t, and the breadth to &s;eventy and eight. It is divided lengthways by the river Liu&s;|na, which receives the Woxna a little before it di&s;|embogues it&s;elf into the gulph of Bothnia. The cour&s;e of the river Eck&s;und is a little more norther|ly. The capital, Hudwick&s;wald, in Latin <HI>Huding|&s;ualdia,</HI> &s;tands on the &s;ide of the Bothnic gulph, near the mouth of the river Eck&s;und, between the i&s;lands of Agan and Bal&s;oon, and carries on a con|&s;iderable traffick in timber, pitch, ro&s;in, corn and hides. Soderhamn, near the mouth of the Liu&s;na, is provided with a good haven. The other towns of Hien, Swegh, Korbole, and Lu&s;dal, are either &s;ituated on the &s;ame river, or in its neighbour|hood; but Alta is an inland town, twenty miles to the we&s;tward of Soderhamn.</P>
<P>The province of Dalekarlia &s;tretches one hun|dred and &s;ixty-five miles in length, and one hun|dred in breadth, having for its confines the Nor|wegian mountains on the we&s;t and north, Hel&s;ingia and Ge&s;tricia on the ea&s;t, and on the &s;outh We&s;|termania and Wermeland. It is divided into three valleys, and, in lieu of towns, can only boa&s;t of a few indifferent villages. It is covered with moun|tains, which abound with mines of iron and cop|per, and &s;ome of the&s;e are incredibly deep. Here|tofore the inhabitants of Dalekarlia were remark|able
<PB N="263" REF="2750">
for their courage, ferocity, and &s;pirit of inde|pendance. Almo&s;t all the revolutions of Sweden have begun or ended in this province. Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a, having e&s;caped from his confinement at Co|penhagen, retired to Dalekarlia, encouraged and per&s;uaded tho&s;e highlanders to take arms and &s;hake off the Dani&s;h yoke. By dint of their valour, and his own conduct, he freed his country from the tyranny of Chri&s;tiern II. and having mounted the throne of Sweden, e&s;tabli&s;hed the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his own family. The chief villages are the&s;e: Idra, &s;ituated on the river El&s;inam, one of the &s;ources of the Dala, which runs into the Silian lake; Lima, &s;ix and thirty miles farther &s;outh; and Hedemora, built on the river Dala, near the confines of We&s;termania, about forty miles from Up&s;al.</P>
<P>Medelpadia, a mountainous country, covered with fore&s;ts, lying between the Bothnic gulph, Angermania, Jempterland, and Hel&s;ingia, is wa|tered by the three rivers, of which Indal and Ne&s;a|rund are the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. At the mouth of this la&s;t &s;tands the capital, Sund&s;wald, the harbour of which is pretty commodious: to the &s;outhward is a rocky coa&s;t, extending forty miles. In this province are the &s;ea-ports of Ha&s;io on the Indal, and Nirunda on the Ni&s;arund: Trop and Tuna &s;tand higher up on the &s;ame river. Tors, Indal, and Carlobec, are &s;ituated on the river Indal; and on the coa&s;t are the towns of Anas, Sion, and Guarp.</P>
<P>Angermania, bounded on the north by We&s;t Bothnia and Lapland, by the gulph of Bothnia on the ea&s;t, by Medelpadia on the &s;outh, and on the we&s;t by Jempterland, is an extent of about ninety miles &s;quare, watered by the river Angerman|flodt. The country is mountainous, woody, and of cour&s;e thinly inhabited. The only towns of
<PB N="264" REF="2760">
note in this di&s;trict are Herno&s;and and Natra: the former &s;tands on the Bothnic gulph, and, having the advantage of a good harbour, enjoys a &s;mall &s;hare of commerce: Natra is &s;ituated in a bay of the &s;ame gulph, about five and forty miles more northerly.</P>
<P>The province of Jemptia, or Jempterland, one of the mo&s;t northerly in Sweden, is a wild coun|try, watered by the Indal, which forms a large lake in the middle of the province, and runs into Medelpadia, and the Hamerdal, that runs from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, and enters Angermania. Here are no cities or towns of any con&s;ideration. There is a fortre&s;s at Re&s;&s;und, about three&s;core miles to the we&s;tward of Herno&s;and; and the chief village, called Lida, &s;tands about twenty miles further to the northward.</P>
<P>We&s;t Bothnia, lying along the northern &s;ide of the Bothnic gulph, bounded on the &s;outh by An|germania, and on the we&s;t and north by Swedi&s;h Lapland, is pretty well peopled, abounds with vil|lages, and is watered by the Lapland rivers Uma, Skelefta, Pitha, Lula, Rana, Torno, and Rimi, which di&s;charge them&s;elves into the gulph, and give names to the towns &s;ituated at their re&s;pective mouths. Torno &s;tands at the bottom of the gulph, near the confines of Lapland, has a good harbour, and is a place of &s;ome trade.</P>
<P>The &s;econd divi&s;ion of Sweden, called Gothia, or Gothland, comprehends Ea&s;t Gothland, We&s;t Gothland, and South Gothland: Ea&s;t Gothland in|cludes the country properly &s;o called, Smaland, and the i&s;land of Oeland. Ea&s;t Gothland is bounded on the north by Sudermania, on the ea&s;t by the Baltic, on the &s;outh by Smaland, and on the we&s;t by the lake Vetter. The country is flat and fertile, producing plenty of corn, cattle, fi&s;h, fowl, and veni&s;on. The chief town, Norkoping,
<PB N="265" REF="2770">
or Norcopia, &s;ignifying the northern market, &s;tands about &s;eventy-five miles to the &s;outhward of Stock|holm, on the bank of a large rivulet, which, run|ning from the lake Vetter, falls into the gulph of Brawiken. The town is large, and pretty po|pulous; and the inhabitants carry on a tolerable trade in the way of a &s;almon-fi&s;hery. The &s;econd town of this di&s;trict is Sudercopia, or Suderkoping, &s;tanding at the bottom of an arm of the &s;ea, about &s;ixteen miles we&s;t from the &s;hore of the Baltic: though de&s;titute of walls or fortifications, it enjoys &s;ome degree of trade; and &s;ome curious chry&s;tal &s;tones are found in the neighbourhood. About ten miles to the ea&s;tward &s;tands Stegeburg, on the &s;hore of the Baltic; a &s;mall town, with a conve|nient harbour, from which it derives &s;ome com|merce. Wa&s;tena, or Vad&s;ten, is &s;ituated on the ea&s;tern bank of the lake Vetter, five and twenty miles to the we&s;tward of Norkoping, remarkable for nothing but the ruins of a royal palace.</P>
<P>Smaland, or Smalandia, lying between Ea&s;t Gothland, the Baltic, Bleking, and Halland, &s;tretches about one hundred and twenty miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, being about &s;eventy-five miles in breadth. It abounds in wood and cattle, in mines of copper, lead, and iron. The capital, Calmar, is a con&s;iderable city, about one hundred and &s;ixty miles to the &s;outhward of Stockholm, built upon a &s;treight of the Baltic called Calmar|&s;and, oppo&s;ite to the i&s;le of Oeland. The old city, famous for the union of Calmar, by which the three northern crowns were fixed on the head of queen Margaret, was often taken and pillaged; and, finally, burned to the ground in the year 1547. After this misfortune the new city was built in the little i&s;land of Owernholm, upon a large, &s;pacious, and uniform plan. The &s;treets are broad and &s;treight, and the hou&s;es well-built: neverthele&s;s,
<PB N="266" REF="2780">
the place is far from being populous. Though the fortifications are out &s;lender, the town is ren|dered &s;trong by its &s;ituation; &s;urrounded on the the land-&s;ide by mora&s;&s;es and canals, and towards the &s;ea with dangerous rocks and intermediate whirlpools; except along the mole, which is built of &s;tone, and defended by the fortre&s;s of Grim|&s;kar, founded on a rock, and &s;ecured with a good garri&s;on. Behind the old town &s;tands the ca&s;tle, &s;trongly fortified, and of difficult acce&s;s. Calmar is a town of con&s;iderable trade, and the pa&s;s from Sweden into Germany. Here at pre&s;ent re&s;ides a &s;uperintendant for the government of the clergy. The other towns of this di&s;trict are Wexco, or Vexca; We&s;terwick, or Ve&s;trovicum; Eke&s;io, or Eke&s;ium; and Jenekoping, or Jenecopia. Wexco is a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, on the banks of the lake Salen, about five and forty miles to the north-we&s;t of Cal|mar. We&s;terwick is a &s;ea-port town of con&s;ider|able trade on the Baltic, about &s;eventy miles to the northward of Calmar. Eke&s;io &s;tands five and forty miles to the we&s;t of Calmar. Jenekoping is &s;ituated on the lake Vetter, &s;ixty miles to the north-we&s;t of Calmar: it enjoys &s;ome trade, and is defended by a citadel. Oeland &s;hall be de&s;cribed in our ac|count of the i&s;les belonging to Sweden.</P>
<P>The province of We&s;t Gothland Proper, is bounded on the &s;outh-ea&s;t by Smaland, on the &s;outh-we&s;t by Halland, on the north-we&s;t by the river Gothelba and the province of Dulia, on the north by the lake Wenner and part of Vermeland, and on the ea&s;t by part of Nericia and the lake Vetter, that divides it from Ea&s;t Gothland. This exten&s;ive province is well watered with lakes and rivers; abounds with excellent pa&s;tures, in which the inhabitants breed numerous herds of black cattle, and are enriched by the &s;ale of this com|modity. The capital, Gottenburg, in Latin <HI>Gothe|burgum,</HI>
<PB N="267" REF="2790">
is &s;ituated in the Schager-rack, or Cate|gate, on the &s;outh branch of the river Gothelba, which here falls into the &s;ea, forming a commo|dious harbour for the city. Gottenburg was built in the year 1607, under the reign of Charles IX. who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ors indulged it with many extraordi|nary privileges, in con&s;equence of which it is be|come a place of con&s;iderable commerce. In the year 1644, the Danes exerted their utmo&s;t endea|vours for the de&s;truction of this city, which, how|ever, they could not reduce. At pre&s;ent it is one of the &s;tronge&s;t maritime towns in the kingdom. Skaren, or Skara, a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, above four&s;core miles to the north-we&s;t of Gottenburg, was the &s;eat of the antient kings of Sweden. The ruins of their palace are &s;till to be &s;een, and, if we may judge from the &s;ituation, the walls, and the &s;truc|ture, it appears to have been one of the mo&s;t &s;tately edifices in all Europe. In the neighbourhood of this antient palace &s;tands the mountain Kenda|kulle, remarkable for its height and fertility. It is covered with a variety of trees, &s;hrubs, herbs, and plants, which not only afford a delightful pro|&s;pect to the eye, but likewi&s;e yield food and &s;helter to an infinite number of birds, that in the &s;um|mer ince&s;&s;antly warble among the&s;e delicious groves. Skara, though once the metropolis of We&s;t Goth|land, is now a poor incon&s;iderable town, open and defencele&s;s. Fifteen miles to the north-we&s;t of this place &s;tands Lidkoping, called in Latin <HI>Lidae|forum,</HI> at the mouth of the river Lida, where it falls into the lake Wenner. The other towns of this province are Falcoping, &s;ituated on the bank of a &s;mall lake, which empties it&s;elf into the river Lida; and Marie&s;tadt, founded by Mary-Anne, con&s;ort to king Charles IX. on the ea&s;tern bank of the lake Wenner: but all the&s;e places are at pre&s;ent poor and incon&s;iderable.</P>

The di&s;trict of Wermeland, or Vermelandia, having for its boundaries Dalekarlia on the north, We&s;termania and Nericia on the ea&s;t, the lake Wenner on the &s;outh, and on the we&s;t Norway, with part of Dalia; extends about one hundred and forty-four miles from north to &s;outh, and near one hundred in breadth, abounds with lakes and mar&s;hes, is thinly peopled, produces &s;ome mines of iron, and one of copper. The chief towns are Carlo&s;tad, built by Charles IX. in the place where &s;tood the antient city of Tingivalla, on the northern bank of the lake Wenner, about one hundred and twenty miles we&s;t from Stockholm; Philip&s;tad, five and twenty miles to the north-ea&s;t of Carlo&s;tad, a place of difficult acce&s;s, &s;ituated among&s;t brooks and mora&s;&s;es; and Ru&s;coy, about the &s;ame di&s;tance from Philip&s;tad to the &s;outhward.</P>
<P>Dalia, or Daal, a &s;mall province, bounded by the lake Wenner on the ea&s;t, We&s;t Gothland Pro|per on the &s;outh-ea&s;t, by the government of Bahus and part of Aggerhus on the we&s;t and north-we&s;t, and by Wermeland on the north-ea&s;t, &s;tretches from north to &s;outh about four&s;core miles, and not above four and twenty in breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t. The country is barren and mountainous, abounding with lakes and rivers, that fall into the lake Wenner; but affords good pa&s;ture for cattle, which are of a larger breed here than in any other part of Sweden. The mo&s;t noted towns are Dale|burg and Tweta: the fir&s;t on the we&s;tern bank of the Wenner; the other &s;ituated on the &s;ame lake, but thirty miles farther north.</P>
<P>South Gothland is &s;urrounded every where by the &s;ea, except on the north, where it is bounded by Ea&s;t and We&s;t Gothland: it is &s;ubdivided into the three di&s;tricts of Halland, Schonen, and Ble|kinge. Halland, lying between Schonen, the two Gothlands, and the &s;ea of Denmark, extends a &s;ea|coa&s;t
<PB N="269" REF="2810">
of about &s;eventy-five miles, though the breadth does not exceed two and twenty. This country, which is plea&s;ant and fertile, formerly belonged to Denmark; but, in the year 1645, was mortgaged to Sweden as a &s;ecurity for the free pa&s;&s;age of the Sound, and afterwards yielded to that kingdom for ever by the treaty of Ro&s;child. Helm&s;tad, or Hilmo&s;tadium, the capital of the province, &s;tanding upon the Categate, has the ad|vantage of a good harbour; in con&s;equence of which it enjoys a con&s;iderable trade. The other towns of this di&s;trict are Laholm, at the mouth of the river Laga, a &s;mall place, with a good harbour and a citadel; Tralkenberg, another incon&s;iderable town, &s;ituated at the mouth of a large river, from which it derives its name, a &s;ea-port of &s;ome trade, defended by a ca&s;tle; and Warberg, a petty place, about &s;even and twenty miles to the north of Helm|&s;tad, provided with a large harbour, and &s;ecured by a &s;trong ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>Schonen, in Latin <HI>Scania,</HI> a penin&s;ula, &s;eparated by the Sound from Zealand, is bounded on the north by Halland and Smaland, on the ea&s;t and &s;outh by Blekinge and the Baltic. This province, extending about eighty miles in length, and &s;ixty in breadth, is the mo&s;t &s;outhern and the mo&s;t fruit|ful country in Sweden, abounding with mines of &s;ilver, lead, and iron, corn, cattle, and all the conveniences of life. It formerly belonged to Denmark; but was finally annexed to Sweden by a treaty, concluded in the year 1679. Since that period, however, Schonen has been often the theatre of war, kindled among the powers of the North. The capital city, Lunden, called in Latin <HI>Lundinum, Scoenorum,</HI> &s;tands at &s;ome di&s;tance from the &s;ea-&s;hore, about four and twenty miles to the ea&s;tward of Copenhagen. It was formerly an arch|bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and the &s;eat of an univer&s;ity, at which
<PB N="270" REF="2820">
the celebrated Samuel Puffendorf was educated: but the metropolitan dignity was removed to Co|penhagen, and the univer&s;ity &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The city was once large and con&s;iderable, adorned with two and twenty churches. The cathedral of St. Laurence, which &s;till remains, is a magnificent &s;tructure, remarkable for a very lofty &s;pire, that &s;erves as a land-mark to &s;ailors, and for a curious clock, &s;aid to have been contrived by Ca&s;par Bar|tholinus. This machine not only exhibits the hour, day, month, year, and fe&s;tivals; but is &s;o artfully con&s;tructed, that when the hour revolves, two figures of armed men on hor&s;eback come forth, and, encountring each other, give as many blows as the hammer is to &s;trike on the bell: then a door opening, di&s;covers the Virgin Mary &s;itting on a throne, with Chri&s;t in her arms, and the wi&s;e men paying their homage to him, while two trum|peters &s;ound a note of triumph. In the neigh|bourhood of this city we ob&s;erve the hill on which, in antient times, the kings u&s;ed to be elected. Malmoe, or, as the Dutch term it, Ellebogen, is a &s;mall but populous town, &s;ituated on the Sound, and enjoying a con&s;iderable &s;hare of commerce. Land&s;kroon, in Latin <HI>Coronea,</HI> &s;tanding likewi&s;e on the Sound, is a &s;trong well fortified town, with a commodious harbour, productive of commerce. The ca&s;tle is a place of great &s;trength and impor|tance. It was in this neighbourhood that Chri&s;|tiern V. of Denmark was defeated in a pitched battle by Charles XI. of Sweden, in the year 1677. El&s;ingburg, or Hel&s;ingburgum, is &s;ituated al&s;o on the &s;hore of the Sound, oppo&s;ite to Croonenburg in Zealand. It is a place of con&s;iderable trade, and was formerly fortified; but no part of its for|tifications now remain, except an old ca&s;tle, with a &s;quare high tower, that &s;erves as a direction for mariners</P>

The province of Blekinge, lying between Sma|land, Schonen, and the Baltic, &s;tretching above four&s;core miles in length from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and fifty at its broade&s;t part; is mountainous, woody, and barren, though watered by &s;everal rivers. The &s;outhern coa&s;t is rendered very diffi|cult and dangerous, by a great number of rocks and i&s;lands. The principal towns of this province are Chri&s;tian&s;tadt, Chri&s;tianople, Ahuys, Carl|&s;croon, and Car&s;holmn. Chri&s;tian&s;tadt is &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of mora&s;&s;es, on the banks of a river that falls into the Baltic at Ahuys, at the di&s;tance of eight miles from the &s;ea. This place, though &s;trong by its &s;ituation, has been &s;everal times taken in the cour&s;e of wars with Denmark. Chri&s;tian|ople, at the ea&s;tern point of this province, was once the capital, and enjoyed the advantage of a good harbour; but Charles XI. levelled it with the ground. Ahuys, or Ahau&s;en, &s;tands on the Baltic, at the mouth of the river Hellean, having a &s;afe capacious, and much frequented harbour. Carl&s;croon, or Caroli Corona, was built by Charles XI. on a little i&s;land, which a long bridge joins to the continent. The town, which covers the whole i&s;land, &s;tands about five and forty miles to the ea&s;t of Ahuys, and enjoys an excellent harbour, well fortified, in which a con&s;iderable part of the royal navy commonly rides &s;ecure. Car&s;holmn is a &s;ea-port town, between Carl&s;croon and Ahuys.</P>
<P>The third great divi&s;ion of Sweden is Livonia, or Leifland, bounded on the north by the gulph of Finland, on the we&s;t by that part of the Baltic called the gulph of Riga, on the ea&s;t by Mu&s;covy and Ingria, on the &s;outh by the dutchy of Cour|land and &s;ome part of Lithuania. This province is extremely well &s;ituated for commerce, being &s;urrounded on the we&s;t and north by the &s;ea, on the ea&s;t by the great lake of Pepus, and on the
<PB N="272" REF="2840">
&s;outh by the river Dwina, which, taking its ri&s;e in Mu&s;covy, pa&s;&s;es by the confines of Livonia, di|viding it from Courland; and then falls into the gulph of Livonia at Dunemund. There are, be|&s;ides, three lakes, and many &s;mall rivers, which, by affording water-carriage, greatly favour and fa|cilitate the commerce of the country. The length of Livonia, from north to &s;outh, extends to one hundred and fifty miles; the breadth to one hun|dred and ten. This province, though in many places mar&s;hy, is neverthele&s;s fruitful, producing corn, pa&s;ture, and honey in abundance.</P>
<P>In the twelfth century the Livonians were wild, &s;avage, and involved in the darkne&s;s of pagan &s;uper&s;tition; from which they were converted, with fire and &s;word, by their neighbours of Ger|many. Albert, canon of Bremen, who built Riga, held Livonia as a fief of the Empire, obtained of the Emperor a power to coin money, and was ve&s;ted with authority to in&s;titute a new order of knights, under the denomination of Sword-Bearers. The&s;e military apo&s;tles &s;hed oceans of blood in propa|gating the doctrines of Chri&s;t, the pattern of meek|ne&s;s, and prince of peace: even cru&s;ades were preached up and maintained again&s;t tho&s;e infidels of the North. In the year 1234, the&s;e knights were re-united to the Pru&s;&s;ian or Teutonick Order; and, for a long &s;eries of years, maintained bloody wars, &s;ometimes with the Poles, and &s;ometimes with the Mu&s;covites. In the &s;ixteenth century Al|bert of Brandenburg, the grand ma&s;ter, e&s;pou&s;ed the doctrines of Luther: then the order of Livo|nia was &s;eparated from that of Pru&s;&s;ia, and a &s;chi&s;m among the knights en&s;ued. About the year 1535, the majority of the Livonians declared for the pro|te&s;tant religion, in &s;pite of all the threats and in|trigues of Charles V. emperor of Germany. This country has been alternately a prey to the Ger|mans,
<PB N="273" REF="2850">
the Swedes, the Poles, and the Mu&s;covites. In 1660, it was intirely ceded to the Swedes by the treaty of Oliva. They kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the pro|vince till the beginning of the pre&s;ent century, when, during the unfortunate war in which the celebrated Charles XII. was engaged, his great rival the czar Peter &s;ubdued the whole dutchy of Livonia, as well as Ingria. The&s;e conque&s;ts were afterwards confirmed to Ru&s;&s;ia by the treaty of Ny&s;tadt, and now con&s;titute part of the Mu&s;covite empire; though they are generally de&s;cribed as provinces of Sweden, to which they formerly be|longed.</P>
<P>The Livonians, though they profe&s;s the religion of Luther, are extremely ignorant, and addicted to many ridiculous ceremonies, which are the re|licks of their antient &s;uper&s;tition. They &s;eem to entertain a very faint notion of a future life: they &s;till &s;acrifice on the tops of hills, and in fore&s;ts. When they kill any bea&s;t, they throw part of it away to the fiend: when they brew, they pour a libation of beer on the ground, as an offering to the &s;ame beings. When a child &s;ickens within &s;ix weeks after bapti&s;m, it is chri&s;tened again under another name, which they &s;uppo&s;e will be more fortunate. At the marriage of a pea&s;ant, the bride rides before the bridegroom, and is preceded by a bagpiper and two friends on hor&s;eback: each of the&s;e friends carries a drawn &s;word, with which he makes a cro&s;s over the door of the bridegroom's hou&s;e: then one of the &s;words is &s;tuck in a beam, over the head of the new-married man, to prevent his being di&s;armed by charms and incantation: for the &s;ame rea&s;on the bride &s;catters red rags along the highway, and over the graves of unbaptized infants. She &s;its at table with her face veiled, un|til the gue&s;ts are &s;eated: then &s;he and her wedded &s;pou&s;e retire to bed, and in two hours return to
<PB N="274" REF="2860">
the company, who fea&s;t, dance, and drink, until every individual drops down with wearine&s;s and intoxication.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants of Livonia are mi&s;erable &s;laves to the nobility, who rule and puni&s;h them with the mo&s;t arbitrary rigour; in&s;omuch that the kings of Sweden have interpo&s;ed in their behalf, that they might be treated with more humanity. The nobles are vain, proud, haughty, and ferocious. They enjoy certain privileges, of which they were de|prived by Charles XI. of Sweden, to whom they made a very bold and &s;pirited remon&s;trance, in con&s;equence of which the famous count Patkul was condemned to death and confi&s;cation. This nobleman, however, found means to e&s;cape, and entered into the &s;ervice of Peter czar of Mu&s;covy. In the cour&s;e of the &s;ucceeding war between Ru&s;|&s;ia and Sweden, he fell into the hands of Charles XII. who ordered the &s;entence to be executed upon him, with all the circum&s;tances of the mo&s;t barbarous &s;everity, to the di&s;grace of royalty and reproach of humanity: for he had been guilty of no crime, but that of &s;upporting the intere&s;t of his country with the courage and fortitude of an old Roman: even Charles XI. though he had, from rea&s;ons of &s;tate, been prevailed upon to &s;ign his &s;entence, yet he could not help applauding his pa|trioti&s;m, and was &s;aid to have given him private notice to withdraw.</P>
<P>Livonia is divided into the two provinces of E&s;torna, or E&s;tlandia, and Letten, or Litland.</P>
<P>E&s;tonia, the mo&s;t northern part of the country, is bounded on the &s;outh by Letten, on the ea&s;t by Mu&s;covy, on the north by the gulph of Finland, and on the we&s;t by the gulph of Riga. Revel, the capital, &s;tands on the gulph of Finland, about two hundred and twenty-five miles to the ea&s;tward of Stockholm. It is &s;ituated partly in a level plain,
<PB N="275" REF="2870">
and partly on a mountain, at the top of which is a &s;trong ca&s;tle. Revel was founded by Waldemar II. king of Denmark, who &s;old it, together with the towns of Narva and We&s;emberg, to the grand ma&s;ter of the Teutonic Order. About the middle of the &s;ixteenth century the city put it&s;elf under the protection of Eric king of Sweden, that he might defend it again&s;t the Mu&s;covites, by whom it was be&s;ieged without &s;ucce&s;s. Revel was one of the fir&s;t places admitted into the confederacy of the han&s;e-towns, and carried on a very con&s;iderable traffick till the year 1550; when the Mu&s;covites, having reduced Narva, e&s;tabli&s;hed in this town the commerce they had formerly maintained at Revel: but the trade was brought back into the old channel, when the &s;ame people took Revel in the year 1711; and &s;ince that period the town has enjoyed a con&s;iderable &s;hare of commerce. The inha|bitants &s;till pre&s;erve the privileges which were granted by their patrons the grand ma&s;ters, and the kings of Sweden; and, to this day, maintain the free exerci&s;e of religion. In a word, though the city is &s;ecured by a Mu&s;covite garri&s;on, the people &s;till enjoy their own forms of government, and all other marks of independency. They even hire a guard of their own, to which they commit the keeping of their great market-place. They profe&s;s the prote&s;tant religion, according to the confe&s;&s;ion of Aug&s;burgh; and the government of the city is democratic, con&s;i&s;ting of elective ma|gi&s;trates and coun&s;ellors, who, in deliberating on affairs of importance, are obliged to con&s;ult occa|&s;ionally the chiefs of the people. The pea&s;ants that were formerly tran&s;ported hither from Den|mark, &s;till di&s;tingui&s;h them&s;elves from the original natives of the country by their manners, cu&s;toms, and habit. In the neighbourhood of Revel ap|pear the ruins of a noble mona&s;tery, founded by a
<PB N="276" REF="2880">
citizen in the beginning of the fifteenth century. The friars and nuns of this convent are &s;aid to have conver&s;ed together at a di&s;tance, by means of certain &s;igns, of which they compo&s;ed a dictio|nary. During the la&s;t &s;iege of Revel fifty thou|&s;and inhabitants died of the plague, which was probably owing to the want of room, fre&s;h air, and provi&s;ions; for great numbers of people from the country had taken &s;helter in the city.</P>
<P>The &s;econd town of Livonia is Narva, or Nerva, &s;ituated on a river of the &s;ame name, which divides Livonia from Ingria. It was built by Waldemar II. king of Denmark, taken by John Ba&s;ilowitz czar of Mu&s;covy, retaken by the Swedes, and, finally, reduced by the czar Peter. In the year 1700, it was be&s;ieged by an army of eighty thou|&s;and Ru&s;&s;ians under the command of the duke de Croy: Charles XII. of Sweden advanced to its relief at the head of eight thou&s;and men, attacked the Mu&s;covites in their lines, defeated them en|tirely, &s;lew twenty thou&s;and on the &s;pot, made the general pri&s;oner, and indeed took all their prin|cipal officers; together with one hundred and ninety cannons or mortars, one hundred and &s;even|ty-one colours or &s;tandards, and the whole bag|gage of their army.</P>
<P>Oppo&s;ite to Narva, on the other &s;ide of the river, is the fortre&s;s of Iwanogorod, built upon a &s;teep rock, which the river almo&s;t &s;urrounds. At the foot of this rock &s;tands a little town, called Ru&s;&s;ian Narva, inhabited by Mu&s;covites only. The&s;e people, among other &s;uper&s;titious rites and ceremonies, ob&s;erve the eye of Whit&s;unday as a fe&s;tival &s;acred to the dead. On this occa&s;ion the women a&s;&s;emble in the church-yard, and, &s;pread|ing napkins on the graves and tomb-&s;tones, cover them with a variety of di&s;hes of broiled and fried fi&s;h, cakes, cu&s;tards, and painted eggs: then the
<PB N="277" REF="2890">
prie&s;t perfumes them with frankincen&s;e, and holds forth in long prayers; during which the women weep and wail, with the mo&s;t piteous outcries and lamentations. In the mean while the clerk, who follows the prie&s;t, gathers up the offerings for the u&s;e and entertainment of his principal.</P>
<P>The river Nerva, which flows from the lake Peibus, and di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the gulph of Finland, is extremely rapid. About half a league above the city there is a cataract that de&s;erves par|ticular notice: the water ru&s;hes down a &s;teep pre|cipice with the mo&s;t hideous roaring, and with &s;uch violence da&s;hes again&s;t the rocks, that it is broken and comminuted into a vapour, which con|tinually ri&s;es like a mi&s;t; and, when the &s;un &s;hines a&s;lant upon it in the morning, produces a beautiful rainbow. At pre&s;ent Nerva belongs to the Mu&s;|covites, who returned to the &s;iege of it in the year 1704; and, after two months open trenches, car|ried it by a&s;&s;ault. On this occa&s;ion they committed the mo&s;t &s;hocking barbarities: general Horn, who commanded the garri&s;on, was &s;ent pri&s;oner to Mo&s;cow, where he was confined in a dungeon, with his wife and family, and underwent a thou|&s;and indignities.</P>
<P>E&s;tonia abounds with towns and fortre&s;&s;es. Nie|&s;lat is a &s;trong fort on the we&s;tern bank of the river Narva, near the place where it i&s;&s;ues from the lake Peibus. Wei&s;enberg, on the river Wei&s;s, about one hundred and twenty miles to the we&s;t|ward of Narva, is a &s;trong fortification, in which Charles XII. erected magazines for his expedition into Livonia. Wi&s;&s;en&s;tein, or Witten&s;tein, is a &s;trong ca&s;tle, &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of a mora&s;s, about thirty miles to the &s;outhward of Wi&s;enberg. Tol&s;burg is a &s;mall &s;ea-port town on the gulph of Finland, at the mouth of the river Seni&s;teback, about ninety miles to the ea&s;tward of Narva. Ba|dis,
<PB N="278" REF="2900">
or Padis, is a fortre&s;s on the river A&s;&s;a, twenty miles to the we&s;tward of Revel. Hap&s;al, or Hap|&s;el, &s;ituated on a &s;mall gulph of the Baltic, about thirty miles to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Revel, was formerly a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and &s;ubject to Denmark: it has been &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the hands of the Mu&s;covites and the Swedes; but the Ru&s;&s;ians gained po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it again in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century. Lehal, &s;tanding on the gulph of Riga, &s;ixty miles to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Hap&s;al, is a place of &s;trength, defended by a well fortified ca&s;tle. Parnaw, in Latin <HI>Parnavia,</HI> &s;ituated at the mouth of the river from whence it derives its name, on the gulph of Riga, &s;ixty-five miles to the &s;outhward of Revel, was formerly one of the hans-towns, and capital of a Poli&s;h palatinate: the town is pretty well for|tified, and &s;till enjoys a good &s;hare of trade, great quantities of corn being here &s;hipped for the Ne|therlands. It boa&s;ts a &s;trong ca&s;tle, and an univer|&s;ity, which however is but little frequented. In the year 1710, it fell under the dominion of the Mu&s;covites. Derpt, called by the Mu&s;covites Ju|nogorod, is a large and antient city, &s;tanding on the river Eimbeck, between the lakes Peibus and Wortzi, about &s;ixty miles to the &s;outhward of Narva. It was formerly a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, as well as the &s;eat of an univer&s;ity, founded by Gu&s;tavus Adolphus; but, in the &s;equel, removed from hence to Parnaw. The hou&s;es of Derpt are built of &s;tone and brick; and the town, which is not very populous, &s;tands under the protection of a &s;trong ca&s;tle. The place has &s;ucce&s;&s;ively belonged to many different ma&s;ters, and is at pre&s;ent &s;ubject to the empire of Ru&s;&s;ia. Felin, a town provided with a ca&s;tle or citadel, &s;tands on a &s;mall river that i&s;&s;ues from the lake Wortzi, about &s;eventy miles to the we&s;tward of Derpt. Ringen and Tarne&s;t
<PB N="279" REF="2910">
are two fortre&s;&s;es: the former five and thirty miles to the &s;outhward of Felin: the other was hereto|fore remarkably &s;trong; but has been often demo|li&s;hed, and the fortifications were never wholly re|paired.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict of Letten is bounded on the we&s;t by the Baltic, on the north by E&s;tonia, on the ea&s;t by Mu&s;covy, and on the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t by the river Dwina; though, even beyond this river, there is a narrow tract of land belonging to Letten, to which likewi&s;e are annexed the i&s;lands of Oe&s;el and Daglio.</P>
<P>Riga, the capital not only of this province, but of all Livonia, is a very con&s;iderable city, &s;tand|ing in a large plain on the we&s;tern bank of the river Dwina, about &s;ix miles above the place where it di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Baltic, at the gulph of Riga, being one hundred and twenty miles to the &s;outhward of Revel. This town was heretofore po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Teutonic Order, and here the grand ma&s;ter re&s;ided: it afterwards engaged in the han&s;eatique confederacy, and for many years con|tinued a free town, under the protection of the German emperors. In the &s;ixteenth century the inhabitants unanimou&s;ly embraced the religion of Luther, expelled the Roman catholic clergy, and &s;eized upon their e&s;tates. Since that period Riga has been &s;everal times reduced, and alternately &s;ubject to the Mu&s;covites, the Poles, and the Swedes. In the month of July, 1710, it was final|ly taken by the Ru&s;&s;ians, after they had reduced it to a heap of rubbi&s;h, and &s;till continues under their dominion. The city has ri&s;en more beautiful and commodious from its a&s;hes; is large, popu|lous, and carries on a very con&s;iderable trade in corn, hemp, flax, pitch, tar, planks, furs, Ru&s;&s;ian leather, and pot-a&s;hes: the&s;e articles are exchanged for the commodities of more &s;outhern countries.
<PB N="280" REF="2920">
The harbour is guarded by the fort of Dunamun|der-&s;chans, built about &s;ix miles below the city, near the mouth of the river Dwina. The town it&s;elf is well fortified with walls, ba&s;tions, a large and deep fo&s;&s;e, a &s;trong ca&s;tle on the river, in which the governor re&s;ides, and a fortre&s;s oppo&s;ite to the town on the other &s;ide of the river.</P>
<P>The other remarkable places of this province are Kokenhau&s;en, on the river Dwina, about nine|ty miles to the ea&s;tward of Riga; Nieuhaus, on the frontiers of Mu&s;covy; Marienburg, about five and twenty miles to the &s;outh-we&s;t of Nieuhaus; Warbeck, at the mouth of the river Eimbeck, near the lake Peibus; Treiden, on the river of that name, about forty-five miles to the ea&s;tward of Riga; Sewold, on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river; and Wolmer, which &s;tands on the &s;ame river, eighty miles to the north-ea&s;t of Riga.</P>
<P>Ingria, or Ingermerland, lying to the northward of Livonia, is bounded by the bottom of the gulph of Finland, the river Nieva, and the lake Ladoga, to the northward; by the river Luga on the &s;outh; on the we&s;t by part of the lake Peibus, and the river Narva, dividing it from that part of Livonia; and on the ea&s;t by an imaginary line, drawn from the town of Luba to the river Luga. This coun|try, &s;tretching about one hundred and thirty miles in length, and &s;eventy in breadth, is very fruitful, and abounds with cattle. Here likewi&s;e is found a great number of wild bea&s;ts, including elks, which, during the &s;ummer, &s;wim the river Nieva into Carelia, and return at the approach of winter. The czar Peter, being de&s;irous of opening an ea&s;y communication between Archangel and the Baltic, by means of the gulph of Finland, in order to fa|cilitate and improve the commerce of his domi|nions, re&s;olved to obtain po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ingria, which accordingly he reconquered from Sweden in the
<PB N="281" REF="2930">
beginning of this century. The capital of Ingria is Peter&s;burg, one of the mo&s;t &s;tupendous efforts of human re&s;olution. It is &s;ituated between Fin|land and Ingria, about one hundred and eighty miles to the ea&s;tward of Revel, and three hundred and eighty-&s;even miles from Stockholm. The czar Peter, that amazing compound of greatne&s;s and barbarity, fired with the ambition of becoming a maritime power in the Baltic, re&s;olved to found this city, which is now the re&s;idence of the Ru&s;&s;ian court, and the centre of trade for all the Mu&s;co|vite dominions. The &s;pot he pitched upon was a low, fenny, uncultivated i&s;land, formed by the branches of the river Nieva, before they fall into the gulph of Finland. In the &s;ummer this i&s;land was covered with mud; and in winter became a frozen pool, rendered almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible by dreary fore&s;ts and deep mora&s;&s;es, the haunts of bears, wolves, and other &s;avage animals. Such was the natural &s;tate of the ground on which Peter has rai&s;ed an unexampled monument of greatne&s;s and policy. Having taken the fort of Nattebourg, and the town of Nei&s;chanz, in the year 1703, this mighty conqueror a&s;&s;embled in Ingria above three hundred thou&s;and men, Ru&s;&s;ians, Tartars, Co&s;|&s;acks, Livonians, and others, even from the mo&s;t di&s;tant parts of his empire, and laid the founda|tion of the citadel and fortifications, which were fini&s;hed in four months, almo&s;t in de&s;pite of Na|ture. He was obliged to open ways through fo|re&s;ts, drain bogs, rai&s;e dykes, and lay cau&s;eways, before he could pretend to found the new city. The workmen were ill provided with nece&s;&s;ary tools and implements, &s;uch as &s;pades, pick-axes, &s;hovels, planks, and wheel-barrows: they were even obliged to fetch the earth from a great di&s;|tance in the &s;kirts of their garments, or in little
<PB N="282" REF="2940">
bags, made of old mats and rags &s;ewed together. They had neither huts nor hou&s;es to &s;helter them from the &s;everity of the weather: the country, which had been de&s;olated by war, could not accom|modate &s;uch a multitude with provi&s;ions; and the &s;upplies by the lake Ladoga were often retarded by contrary winds. In con&s;equence of the&s;e hard|&s;hips, above one hundred thou&s;and men are &s;aid to have peri&s;hed: neverthele&s;s the work proceeded with incredible vigour and expedition; while Peter, for the &s;ecurity of his workmen, formed a great camp, in &s;uch a manner, that his infantry con|tinued in Finland, and his cavalry were quartered in Ingria. Some Swedi&s;h cruizers being de&s;cried in the neighbourhood, the Czar po&s;ted a body of troops in the i&s;le of Rutzari, by whom the Swedes were repul&s;ed, and the work met with no further interruption. The buildings of the city kept pace with the fortre&s;s, which is in the centre of the town, &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by the Nieva; and, in little more than a year, above thirty thou|&s;and hou&s;es were erected. At pre&s;ent there may be about double that number in Peter&s;bourg, though many of them are paultry and incon&s;ider|able. In order to people this city, Peter invited hither merchants, artificers, mechanicks, and &s;ea|men, from all the different countries of Europe: he demoli&s;hed the town of Nieu&s;chans, and brought hither not only the materials of the hou&s;es, but the inhabitants them&s;elves. A thou&s;and families were drawn from Mo&s;cow: he obliged his nobility to quit their palaces and their villas in and about Mo&s;|cow, and take up their re&s;idence at Peter&s;bourg, in a much more cold and comfortle&s;s climate. Finally, re&s;olving to remove hither the trade of Archangel, he i&s;&s;ued an ordonnance, importing, That all &s;uch merchandize as had been conveyed

to Archangel, in order to be &s;old to foreigners, &s;hould now be &s;ent to Peter&s;bourg, where they &s;hould pay no more than the u&s;ual duties. The&s;e endeavours and regulations have rendered this one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t flouri&s;hing cities in Eu|rope. The Ru&s;&s;ian boyars and nobility have built magnificent palaces, and are now reconciled to their &s;ituation. At fir&s;t many hou&s;es were built of timber; but the&s;e being &s;ubject to &s;udden confla|grations, in &s;pite of all the precautions that could be taken, the Czar, in the year 1714, i&s;&s;ued an order, that all new hou&s;es &s;hould be walled with brick, and covered with tiles. The fort is an ir|regular hexagon, with oppo&s;ite ba&s;tions. This, together with all the re&s;t of the fortifications, was in the beginning formed of earth only; but in the &s;equel they were faced with &s;trong walls, and pro|vided with ca&s;emates, which are bomb-proof. In the curtain of the fort, on the right-hand &s;ide, is a noble di&s;pen&s;ary, well &s;upplied with excellent medicines, and enriched with a great number of porcelain va&s;es from China and Japan. From one of the gates of the fort a draw-bridge is thrown over an arm of the river, in which the Czar's gal|leys, and other &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, are &s;heltered in the winter. The mo&s;t remarkable building within the fort is the cathedral, built by the direction of an Italian architect. Peter&s;bourg is partly built on little i&s;lands, &s;ome of which are connected by draw-bridges, and partly on the continent. In the highe&s;t part, on the bank of the Nieva, the Czar fixed his habitation, or ordinary re&s;idence, built of free-&s;tone, and &s;ituated &s;o as to command a pro&s;pect of the greater part of the city. Here likewi&s;e is a royal foundery; together with the &s;uperb hou&s;es of many noblemen. One di&s;agree|able circum&s;tance in Peter&s;bourg is, that none of
<PB N="284" REF="2970">
the numerous &s;treets have names, &s;o that it is very difficult for a &s;tranger to find out particular places. The mar&s;hy ground on which the city is built, being found extremely &s;lippery, dirty, and incom|modious, the Czar ordered every inhabitant to pave a certain &s;pace before his own door. In the year 1716, Peter, taking a fancy to the i&s;land Wa&s;ili-O&s;terno, which he had given as a pre&s;ent to prince Menzikoff, re&s;umed the grant, and ordered the city to be extended into this quarter. He even obliged the boyars, or nobles, to build &s;tone|hou&s;es on this &s;pot, though they were already in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of others on the &s;ide of Ingria: accord|ingly this is now the mo&s;t magnificent part of the city. On the other &s;ide of a branch of the Nieva &s;tands the Czar's country or &s;ummer palace, pro|vided with a fine garden and orangerie. On the bank of the &s;ame river is the &s;laboda, or &s;uburbs, in which the Germans generally chu&s;e their habita|tion. Peter&s;bourg is very much &s;ubject to dan|gerous inundations. In the year 1715, all the ba&s;tions and draw-bridges were either overwhelmed, or carried away. The breadth, depth, and rapidity of the Nieva, have rendered it extremely difficult, if not impracticable, to join the i&s;lands and the continent by bridges. Be&s;ides, Peter was aver&s;e to this expedient for another rea&s;on: re&s;olved to accu&s;tom his &s;ubjects to navigation, he not only rejected the project of a bridge, but al&s;o ordered, that no boat &s;hould pa&s;s between the i&s;lands and the continent, except by the help of &s;ails only. In con&s;equence of this &s;trange regulation many lives were lo&s;t: but at length he gained his point; and by habituating his &s;luggi&s;h Mu&s;covites to the dan|gers of the &s;ea, in a little time produced a breed of hardy &s;ailors. The adjacent country is &s;o bar|ren, that the town mu&s;t be &s;upplied with provi|&s;ions
<PB N="285" REF="2980">
from a great di&s;tance; con&s;equently they are extremely dear. Here are woods in plenty, con&s;i&s;ting of pine, fir, alder, birch, poplar, and elm; but the oak and the beech are generally brought from Ca&s;an. In winter the weather is ex|tremely cold, and exce&s;&s;ive hot in the &s;ummer. In June the length of the night does not exceed three hours, during which the natives enjoy a con|tinued twilight: but in December the &s;un is not vi&s;ible more than three hours above the horizon.</P>
<P>The czar Peter, who was indefatigable in his endeavours to improve and civilize his &s;ubjects, neglected nothing which he thought could contri|bute to the&s;e purpo&s;es. He conde&s;cended even to in&s;titute and regulate a&s;&s;emblies at Peter&s;bourg: the&s;e were opened at five in the afternoon, and the hou&s;e was &s;hut at ten: between the&s;e hours the fa&s;hionable people of both &s;exes met without cere|mony, danced, conver&s;ed, or played either at cards or at che&s;s, this la&s;t being a favourite diver&s;ion among the Ru&s;&s;ians. There was likewi&s;e an apart|ment &s;et apart for drinking brandy and &s;moaking tobacco. Plays and operas were likewi&s;e intro|duced for the &s;ame purpo&s;es: but as Peter had little reli&s;h, and le&s;s ta&s;te, for tho&s;e entertain|ments, they were performed in a very aukward manner in his life-time: however, &s;ince his death, the&s;e performances have been brought to a greater degree of art and decorum.</P>
<P>This great northern legi&s;lator e&s;tabli&s;hed, in the neighbourhood of Peter&s;bourg, manufactures of linnen, paper, &s;altpetre, &s;ulphur, gun-powder, and bricks, together with water-mills for &s;awing tim|ber. He in&s;tituted a marine academy, and obliged every con&s;iderable family in Ru&s;&s;ia to &s;end at lea&s;t one &s;on or kin&s;man, between the ages of ten and eighteen, to this &s;eminary, where he was in&s;tructed in navigation, learned the languages, was taught
<PB N="286" REF="2990">
to perform his exerci&s;es, and to live under the &s;e|vere&s;t di&s;cipline. To crown his other plans of re|formation, he granted letters-patent for founding an academy, upon a very liberal endowment; and though he did not live to execute this &s;cheme, his empre&s;s, who &s;urvived him, brought it to perfec|tion. It was modelled on the plans of the royal &s;ociety in London, and the academy of France. Mr. Bullfinger opened it in the year 1726, with an eloquent &s;peech on the de&s;ign and utility of an academy of &s;ciences; and the profe&s;&s;ors, who have always di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their merit and erudition, publi&s;h an annual collection of their tran&s;actions: a ta&s;k the more ea&s;y, as they have the benefit of printing pre&s;&s;es, well managed, at Peter&s;bourg.</P>
<P>The czar Peter, having laid the foundations, and made &s;ome progre&s;s in building his new city, bethought him&s;elf of a convenient harbour, in which the &s;hipping might be &s;ecure, and pitched upon the i&s;land of Retu&s;ari, or Rutzari, at the mouth of the gulph of Finland. There he built a new town, called Cron&s;ladt, and &s;ecured it with the ca&s;tle of Cron&s;ladt, &s;ituated on a &s;and-bank near the &s;ide of Ingria; &s;o that, between the ca&s;tle and the town, the &s;hipping ride in a &s;afe, deep, and &s;pacious harbour. The ca&s;tle is built in the form of a round tower, &s;urrounded with three tire of galleries, well furni&s;hed with cannon. There are likewi&s;e two &s;mall batteries on the oppo&s;ite i&s;land; and, in ca&s;e of emergency, a large train of artillery may be mounted on the piers of the harbour.</P>
<P>Along the banks of the river, from Cron&s;ladt to Peter&s;bourg, the country is adorned with ele|gant hou&s;es. Among the&s;e the chief are Orangen|baum, belonging to prince Menzikoff; and the Czar's plea&s;ure-hou&s;e, called Peter&s;hoff, which &s;tands on a ri&s;ing ground, is furni&s;hed in the Dutch
<PB N="287" REF="3000">
ta&s;te, and provided with gardens, plantations, fi&s;h|ponds, and ca&s;cades. At the foot of the a&s;cent on which the palace is &s;ituated, there is a canal &s;ixteen miles in length, &s;o large as to admit con&s;i|derable ve&s;&s;els from the &s;ea: it is filled by the con|junction of three rivulets, and was completed in two months. This body of water repleni&s;hes a large re&s;ervoir, from which all the ponds, ca&s;cades, and water-works in the neighbourhood are &s;up|plied. Noteburg, called by the Mu&s;covites Ore&s;|ca, is a &s;ea-port, and &s;trong fortre&s;s, &s;ituated on an i&s;land formed by the river Nieva, near the we&s;tern bank of the lake Ladoga. It was retaken from the Swedes by the czar Peter in the year 1702, improved in its fortifications, and denominated Slentelburg, from <HI>&s;lentel,</HI> a key, becau&s;e it is the key from Finland. Nieu&s;chans is demoli&s;hed. Iwanogorod is a &s;trong ca&s;tle, oppo&s;ite to Narva. Coporio is a fort &s;ituated on the bank of a &s;mall river, above five and forty miles to the north-ea&s;t of Iwanogorod. Jama is another fortre&s;s, built on a river of the &s;ame name, fifteen miles to the north-ea&s;t of Iwanogorod. All the&s;e towns and forts had been ceded by the Mu&s;covites to the Swedes, in a treaty concluded in the year 1618; but were retaken by the Czar in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century.</P>
<P>Finland, Finlandia, Finnonia, Fennia, or Fe|ningia, extends from the gulph of Finland to the Poli&s;h Circle, about three hundred and eighty-&s;ix miles in length from north to &s;outh, and two hun|dred and fifteen from ea&s;t to we&s;t, bounded by Mu&s;covy, part of Lapland, and the gulph of Both|nia. The country produces &s;ome grain, abounds with pa&s;tures and cattle, and the lakes are well &s;tocked with fi&s;h: the&s;e they export to Sweden, together with a con&s;iderable quantity of butter and
<PB N="288" REF="3010">
chee&s;e. The people &s;peak a language peculiar to them&s;elves, though it has a &s;trong affinity with that which is &s;poken in Sweden; and the Lutheran doctrine is the only e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. Of old the Finlanders were governed by kings of their own, until the middle of the thirteenth century, when they were conquered by Eric IX. of Sweden. Since that period Finland, under the title of the Grand Dutchy, has been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as an inheri|tance by the brothers of the Swedi&s;h monarchs; but now it is united to the crown. In Finland, however, part of the province of Savolaxia, the whole of Kexholm, the be&s;t part of Carelia, toge|ther with the town and fortre&s;s of Ny&s;lot, were ceded for ever to Ru&s;&s;ia, by the treaty concluded at Abo in the year 1743. Finland is divided into &s;even provinces: Finland Proper, Nyland, Carelia, Kexholm, Savolax, Tava&s;tia, and Cajania. The capital of Finland Proper, and indeed of the whole dutchy, is Abo, or Aboa, &s;ituated on the Bothnic gulph, at the mouth of the river Aurojoki, over|again&s;t the i&s;le of Aland. The town is a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and is provided with an univer&s;ity, founded and liberally endowed by queen Chri&s;tina. It de|rives a con&s;iderable trade from its convenient har|bour; in the neighbourhood of which is a rock, &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, which when any &s;hip ap|proaches, the needle of the compa&s;s no longer points to the north: a circum&s;tance from which it is conjectured that the rock contains a mine of load&s;tones. The other towns of Finland Proper are the&s;e: Biorno, an incon&s;iderable place, about twelve miles to the north-we&s;t of Abo; Hangout, or Hango, a celebrated &s;ea-port on the gulph of Finland; Biorneburg, a paultry town, &s;tanding on the river Kume, in the gulph of Bothnia; Ny|&s;tadt, or Neo&s;tadium, a &s;mall town in a little bay
<PB N="289" REF="3020">
of the Bothnic gulph, famous for the peace which was concluded at this place in the year 1721, be|tween the late Czar and the king of Sweden. The province of Nyland is parted from Carelia on the ea&s;t by the river Kymen, and on the &s;outh is wa&s;hed by the gulph of Finland. The chief town is Hel|&s;ingfors, or Hel&s;ingford, an incon&s;iderable place, &s;ituated at the mouth of the river Winda, which here falls into the gulph of Finland. The other towns of this di&s;trict are Burgo, Ra&s;eburg, and Ekenes. Burgo is an antient town, &s;tanding on the coa&s;t of the Finland gulph: Ra&s;eburg &s;tands on the &s;ame gulph, and is capital of an earldom: Ekenes is &s;ituated on a penin&s;ula of the &s;ame gulph, and is by rocks and &s;helves rendered of very diffi|cult acce&s;s.</P>
<P>The province of Carelia is a fruitful country, &s;tretching from ea&s;t to we&s;t about one hun|dred and fifty miles. The mo&s;t noted towns are Wyburg, Wekelax, Wilman&s;trand, and Mala. Wyburg, &s;ituated at the bottom of a bay in the Finnic gulph, is a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, a place of con&s;i|derable trade, with a convenient harbour, well &s;ecured with fortifications and a ca&s;tle, which how|ever could not re&s;i&s;t the attacks of the czar Peter, by whom it was reduced. Wekelax is a wretched town on the &s;ame gulph. Wilman&s;trand, &s;ituated in a mora&s;s near a lake, about thirty miles to the northward of Wyburg, belongs to the Mu&s;covites, and has been made famous by the victory which the Ru&s;&s;ians obtained over the Swedes in the year 1741. Mala &s;tands on a &s;mall bay that commu|nicates with the lake Ladoga.</P>
<P>The di&s;trict of Kexholm comprehends a large tract of land, but chiefly roughened with mountains, or co|vered with lakes. There are but two places of any note in this province; namely, Kexholm, a &s;mall ci|ty, &s;tanding among mar&s;hes on the we&s;tern bank of

The di&s;trict of Savolax, bounded on the north by Cajania, on the ea&s;t by Kexholm, on the &s;outh by Carelia, and on the we&s;t by Tava&s;tia, is a barren country, thinly inhabited, abounding with lakes and fore&s;ts. The towns are Ko&s;kimpe, Ny&s;lot, Runal, and Saminge.</P>
<P>The country of Tava&s;tia is mar&s;hy, covered with lakes, and ill peopled. The capital, Ta|va&s;tus, otherwi&s;e called Croneburg, &s;tands in the &s;outhern part of the province, on a &s;mall river that falls into the lake Wana: the place, though incon&s;iderable, is &s;trong by its &s;ituation. The other towns are Sermake, Hattula, Mahatan, Rautalanby, Jem&s;e, Si&s;me, and Padasjoki. All the&s;e are places of &s;mall importance; the greater part &s;ituated on the lake Peinde, or Pejinde, which extends about four&s;core miles in length, commu|nicating with other lakes, particularly with that called Rotzlain; by means of which its waters i&s;&s;ue in the river Kymen, that di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the gulph of Finland. The province of Cajania lies along the gulph of Bothnia, which receives a great number of rivers, by which the di&s;trict is watered. The large&s;t of its numerous lakes is called Ula-tre&s;k, extending about forty-five miles in length, and twenty-four in breadth, and i&s;&s;ues into the &s;ea by the river Ula. In the middle of this piece of water &s;tands the i&s;land Ula, about fifteen miles long, and nine in breadth. The ea&s;tern and northern parts of this province are mountainous; but the re&s;t is tolerably fruitful. Among its towns we number Cajaneburg, the capital, that &s;tands on the lake Ula-tre&s;k, about thirty miles from the confines of Lapland, and is &s;ecured by a &s;trong citadel; Ula and Ulaburg, the

On the &s;ame coa&s;t is &s;ituated Lochto, near the mouth of the river Lochtoa, that &s;prings from a ridge of mountains, which divide Cajania from Tava&s;tia, and, being &s;welled by the waters of the lake Le&s;tjerwi, runs northerly into the gulph of Bothnia. Wa&s;a, or Mu&s;ta&s;ar, is a &s;ea-port on the &s;ame gulph, famous for being the birth-place of the celebrated Gu&s;tavus Va&s;a: Chri&s;tian&s;tadt &s;tands likewi&s;e on the Bothnic gulph, about fifteen miles to the &s;outhward of Wa&s;a; but this mu&s;t not be confounded with the town of Chri&s;tian&s;tadt, &s;ituated in the province of Bleking, which we have already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>The con&s;iderable i&s;lands belonging to Sweden are Gothland, Oeland, Oefel, Dago, Aland, and Hogland.</P>
<P>Gothland, lying in the Baltic, oppo&s;ite to the coa&s;t of Ea&s;t Gothland, extends about fifty-&s;ix miles in length, and about eighteen in breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t. This i&s;land is fertile and po|pulous, producing rich pa&s;tures, cattle, fi&s;h, fowl, timber, excellent water, and beautiful marble. The only con&s;iderable town is Wi&s;by, or Wi&s;burg, built in the we&s;tern &s;ide, on the declivity of a rock, near the &s;ea-&s;hore, &s;urrounded with a &s;trong wall, and &s;ecured by a ca&s;tle near the harbour, where the governor of the i&s;land u&s;ually re&s;ides. This city was con&s;iderable as early as the eighth cen|tury, and in the &s;equel became extremely populous and powerful. The foreigners who traded at Wi&s;|by were &s;o numerous, that, in the thirteenth cen|tury, they were able to make head again&s;t the natives, by whom however they were defeated in

a pitched battle. The place is famous for its laws relating to trade and navigation, which as they are &s;aid to have been taken from tho&s;e of the i&s;le of Oleron in France, have been al&s;o copied and im|proved by the deputies of the han&s;e-towns, and &s;ent to Lubeck in the &s;ixteenth century, on pur|po&s;e to compile a body of laws for the regulation of commerce, which laws are &s;till ob&s;erved through|out the whole Baltic. Wi&s;by was heretofore a very large, &s;uperb, and flouri&s;hing city; but now it is greatly decayed, both in the number and wealth of its inhabitants, and in the importance of its traffick: they &s;till boa&s;t that they were the fir&s;t who invented and compo&s;ed &s;ea-charts and hydro|graphical tables.</P>
<P>The i&s;le of Oeland, lying over-again&s;t the con|tinent of South Gothland, from which it is &s;epa|rated by the narrow &s;treight called Calmar&s;undt, is a long &s;hip of land, extending &s;eventy miles in length, though not above twelve miles at its great|e&s;t breadth. The &s;oil produces good pa&s;tures, on which are fed many herds of oxen, hor&s;es, and fallow-deer. On the we&s;tern coa&s;t there are only two villages, and the town of Borkholm, which is the capital of the i&s;land, a &s;mall place, defended by a ca&s;tle. On the ea&s;tern coa&s;t we find the towns of Boda, Koning&s;gard, Hogaby, Kilda, Stapeling, Gen&s;tala, Rema&s;ten, Mokleby, Stena&s;a, and divers populous villages. Oeland, which has been often attacked, is &s;ecured by many forts and ca&s;tles. Oe&s;el, lying off the coa&s;t of Livonia, ju&s;t before the gulph of Riga, is about forty miles in length, and tolerably fertile. It was conquered from the Swedes by the Mu&s;covites, who &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s this, with all the other appendages of Livonia. The chief town is Aren&s;burg, &s;ituated on the &s;outhern coa&s;t of the i&s;land, and defended by a ca&s;tle. On

<P>MUSCOVY is a va&s;t country, lying be|tween the 47th and 72d degrees of north latitude, and between the 23d and 65th degrees of ea&s;t longitude from London. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to extend fifteen hundred leagues from we&s;t to ea&s;t, and &s;ix hundred from north to &s;outh: but the limits of it ea&s;terly cannot be ea&s;ily a&s;cer|tained, as this part is a meer de&s;ert, abandoned on account of the incur&s;ions of the Tartars; and as for the northern parts, the cold has rendered them almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. Mu&s;covy, likewi&s;e known by the name of White Ru&s;&s;ia, on account of the &s;now by which it is covered for the greate&s;t part of the year, and of Great Ru&s;&s;ia, alluding to its prodi|gious

extent, &s;tretches from the Frozen Sea, or Northern Ocean, as far ea&s;t as Great Tartary and the &s;ea of Japan: on the &s;outh it is bounded by the Calmuck and Cuban Tartary, Per&s;ia, Georgia, the Ca&s;pian and Euxine Seas; and on the we&s;t by Poland and Sweden. Ru&s;&s;ia is divided into four parts, namely, Mu&s;covy Proper, or We&s;tern Mu&s;|covy, Ea&s;tern Mu&s;covy, Mu&s;covite Tartary, and Mu&s;covite Lapland. The&s;e are &s;ubdivided into provinces northern, &s;outhern, ea&s;tern, and we&s;tern, amounting to a very con&s;iderable number, includ|ing &s;ome kingdoms and dutchies, which have been conquered and &s;ubdued by the Czars of Ru&s;&s;ia.</P>

<HEAD>FACE of the COUNTRY, exhibiting MOUN|TAINS, RIVERS, LAKES, and FORESTS.</HEAD>
<P>In the province of Vogulezi is a ridge of moun|tains, called Zimnopoias, or the Girdle of the Earth, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>Montes Riphaei</HI> of the antients. There are likewi&s;e large tracts of de&s;ert &s;ands, that produce nothing but vermin.</P>
<P>Mu&s;covy is in general a flat level country, ex|cept towards the north, where it is rough and moun|tainous. Fore&s;ts abound every where throughout this empire. The plains are mar&s;hy, or flooded with a great number of lakes, &s;ome of which ex|tend above forty leagues in length. The Ladoga and Onega, on the borders of Finland, are the large&s;t in Europe. The Ladoga is formed by four ri|vers; the principal of which are the Voxen, or Corela the Fair, which flows into it from the lake of One|ga, and the Volchova, which runs into it from the &s;outh: the overplus is di&s;charged by a channel into the gulph of Finland. The lake Onega is al&s;o filled by a con&s;iderable number of rivers, near the mouths of which many towns and cities are built, for the convenience of commerce. The other
<PB N="296" REF="3090">
noted lakes are Brela-ozera, from whence a pro|vince derives its name; Iwano&s;ero-cargapol, which lends its name to another province; and Honent, in the neighbourhood of the Great Novogorod.</P>
<P>Mu&s;covy likewi&s;e boa&s;ts a con&s;iderable number of large and famous rivers. The Oby, formed by the junction of the Tobal and the Irtis, in the 65th degree of northern latitude, runs northward into the Frozen Ocean, oppo&s;ite to Nova Zembla, and is the boundary between Europe and A&s;ia: the Manga Sea runs parallel to the Oby, and di&s;em|bogues it&s;elf into the &s;ame &s;ea, which likewi&s;e re|ceives the Pezara, or Petzara, i&s;&s;uing from the lake Petzarcoe in the province of Vagulizi, running the &s;ame cour&s;e. The Dwina takes its orgin in Wolog|da, runs a northerly cour&s;e, and falls into the White Sea below Archangel. The Wolga, or Vol|ga, formerly known by the name of Rha, owes its origin to the lake Uranow, near the frontiers of Lithuania; directs its cour&s;e &s;outh-ea&s;terly through European Ru&s;&s;ia, receiving in its route the rivers Mologo, Mo&s;co, Kioma, Ocka, Samar, and above thrity more; then enters A&s;iatic Ru&s;&s;ia, and by &s;everal channels di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Ca&s;pian Sea, below A&s;tracan: this is the large&s;t and deep|e&s;t river in Ru&s;&s;ia. The Don, formerly called the Tanais, takes its ri&s;e in the middle of Ru&s;&s;ia, is &s;welled by the Weronetz, runs in a &s;outh-ea&s;t di|rection to Kami&s;inka; then winding to the &s;outh-we&s;t, receives the Donets, and falls into the <HI>Palus Moeotis,</HI> or &s;ea of Azoph. The Nieper, heretofore the Bori&s;thenes, ri&s;es in the province of Mo&s;cow, runs through Poland, re-enters Mu&s;covy, pa&s;&s;es Kiof, waters the Ukraine, and, after a &s;outherly cour&s;e through Tartary, falls into the Euxine Sea at Oczakow. The Lower Dwina, ri&s;ing al&s;o in the province of Mo&s;cow, runs through Poland, which it divides from Livonia, and di&s;charges it&s;elf
<PB N="297" REF="3100">
into the Baltic, below Riga. Some of the&s;e mighty rivers run a &s;urpri&s;ing length of cour&s;e: that of the Wolga exceeds two thou&s;and miles: it wa&s;hes the walls of near four&s;core towns, and &s;up|plies the country with prodigious quantities of &s;turgeon, &s;almon, pikes, and other fi&s;hes of &s;tu|pendous &s;ize and exqui&s;ite delicacy. Along its banks are found troufles, and wild a&s;paragus, of a mo&s;t delicious ta&s;te and flavour: here likewi&s;e grow the only oaks that are produced in Mu&s;covy. This country enjoying the benefit of a fruitful &s;oil, with the&s;e other advantages, was &s;o much &s;ubject to the incur&s;ions of the Cuban Tartars, that the greater part of it lay uncultivated, until it was &s;e|cured by an intrenchment made by the direction of the czar Peter, extending from the Volga near the city of Zaritza, to the river Don in the neigh|bourhood of Twia: yet a large tract of land, on the out&s;ide of this work, lies open to the inva&s;ion of tho&s;e freebooters. Though the length of the Don, or Tanais, which ri&s;es in the province of Re|zan, does not exceed four hundred miles in a direct line from its &s;ource to the <HI>Palus Moeotis,</HI> in which it is lo&s;t, it will be found to run above a thou&s;and, if traced in all its windings; in the cour&s;e of which it is &s;welled by many rivers, waters many cities, and forms a great number of beautiful i&s;lands, in one of which is &s;ituated Tckerca&s;ke, the metro|polis of Circa&s;&s;ia.</P>

<HEAD>CLIMATE, SOIL, PRODUCTIONS, VE|GETABLES, and MINERALS.</HEAD>
<P>In &s;uch a va&s;t extent of country, &s;tretching from the Temperate &s;o far into the Frigid Zone, the cli|mate mu&s;t vary con&s;iderably in different places. In the &s;outhern parts of Mu&s;covy the longe&s;t day does not exceed fifteen hours and a half; whereas
<PB N="298" REF="3110">
in the mo&s;t northern the &s;un in &s;ummer is &s;een two months above the horizon. The country in general, though lying under different climates, is exce&s;&s;ively cold in the winter. Towards the north the ground is covered near three quarters of the year with &s;now and ice; and by the &s;everity of the cold many unfortunate per&s;ons are maimed, or peri&s;h. This &s;ort of weather commonly &s;ets in about the latter end of Augu&s;t, and continues till the month of May; in which interval the rivers are frozen to the depth of four or five feet. Water, thrown up into the air, will fall down in i&s;icles: birds are frozen in their flight, and travellers in their &s;ledges. In &s;ome provinces the heats of &s;ummer are as &s;corching as the winter colds are rigorous.</P>
<P>The &s;oil of Mu&s;covy varies &s;till more than the climate, according to the influence of the &s;un and the &s;ituation of the country. The warmer pro|vinces produce wheat, oats, barley, pea&s;e, and rye, together with a variety of herbs and fruits; and the vegetation is &s;o quick, that corn is commonly reaped in two months after it begins to appear above the &s;urface of the ground. The natives u&s;e no other manure than the &s;now, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to enrich the ground, and to cheri&s;h and &s;helter the grain that is &s;own immediately after harve&s;t. The great variety of mu&s;hrooms produced &s;pon|taneou&s;ly in Ru&s;&s;ia, may be con&s;idered as a com|fortable relief to the poor, while they appear as delicacies at the tables of the rich. Above a thou|&s;and waggon-loads of them u&s;ed to be &s;old annual|ly in Mo&s;cow. Perhaps it is on account of the &s;carcity of provi&s;ions, that &s;uch a number of fa&s;ts are in&s;tituted in the Mu&s;covite religion: certainly nothing will &s;o effectually reconcile people to hun|ger, as a conviction that fa&s;ting is a religious duty, plea&s;ing in the &s;ight of heaven.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="3120">
Be&s;ides &s;ome oaks, a great quantity of fir, and tho&s;e productions we have mentioned, Mu&s;co|vy yields rhubarb, flax, hemp, pa&s;ture for cattle, wax, and honey. Among other vegetables we find in Ru&s;&s;ia a particular kind of rice, called p&s;yntha, plenty of excellent melons, and, in the neighbour|hood of A&s;tracan, the famous zoophyton, or animal plant, which the Mu&s;covites call <HI>bonnaret,</HI> or lamb|kin, from its re&s;emblance to a lamb.</P>
<P>Agriculture in general was but little under&s;tood, and le&s;s pro&s;ecuted, in this country, until it was improved under the encouragement and influence of that great patriot the czar Peter, who was in|defatigable in executing his plans of reformation. The natural ignorance, &s;loth, and ob&s;tinacy of the people, together with the tyranny of the nobles, by whom they are mi&s;erably en&s;laved, were &s;uch ob&s;tructions to the improvement of hu&s;bandry, as nothing but his genius could have &s;urmounted. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable articles in the oeconomy of a Ru&s;&s;ian farm are wax and honey, by which the pea&s;ant is often enriched. He cuts down a great number of trees in the fore&s;t, and &s;awing the trunks into a number of parts, bores each of the&s;e, and &s;tops up the hollow at both ends, leaving only a little hole for the admittance of the bees: thus the honey is &s;ecured from all the attempts of the bear, who is extremely fond of it, and tries many different experiments for making him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the lu&s;cious trea&s;ure. Of this honey the Ru&s;|&s;ians make a great quantity of &s;trong metheglin, for their ordinary drink. They likewi&s;e extract from rye a &s;pirit, which they prefer to brandy. Mu&s;covy is very rich in mines of &s;ilver, lead, and iron, which are worked in different parts of the country, and yield a very con&s;iderable revenue to the &s;overeign.</P>

<P>The wild bea&s;ts in the northern part of Ru&s;&s;ia, are the &s;ame with tho&s;e we have mentioned in the articles of Norway and Lapland; &s;uch as rein|deer, bears, foxes, ermins, martens, &s;ables, hares, and &s;quirrels. In the more &s;outhern provinces the Mu&s;covites breed black cattle, &s;mall but hardy hor&s;es, &s;heep, goats, and camels. The breed of cattle and hor&s;es has been enlarged by the care, and under the protection of Peter. The whole empire abounds with wild fowl and game of all &s;orts, and a variety of birds of prey; be&s;ides the different kinds of poultry, which are rai&s;ed in this as well as in other countries. A few particular birds will be de&s;cribed in the account of the re|&s;pective provinces to which they are peculiar. The external parts and provinces of Mu&s;covy are well &s;upplied with &s;ea-fi&s;h from the Northern Ocean, the Baltic, or gulph of Finland, the White Sea, the Black Sea, and the Ca&s;pian: but the whole empire is plentifully provided with fre&s;h-water fi&s;h from the numerous lakes and rivers, yielding im|men&s;e quantities of &s;almon, trout, pike, &s;turgeon, and beluga; the la&s;t being a large fi&s;h, of who&s;e roe the be&s;t caviare is made. Innumerable in&s;ects, like tho&s;e of Lapland, are hatched by the &s;ummer's heat in the &s;ands, mora&s;&s;es, and fore&s;ts, with which this empire abounds, and are &s;o trouble&s;ome as to render great part of the country altogether unin|habitable.</P>

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their CHARACTER, MANNERS, and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>Mu&s;covy is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive its name from the river Mo&s;cka, which waters Mo&s;cow, the ca|pital of the empire, was in all probability peopled
<PB N="301" REF="3140">
from Tartary by wandering tribes, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the appellation of Ro&s;&s;i, &s;ignifying, in the Scla|vonic language, a collected nation; or deriving the name of Ru&s;&s;ians from <HI>Ro&s;&s;eia,</HI> di&s;per&s;ed, or &s;cattered. Be that as it may, this va&s;t empire is but thinly inhabited, in proportion to its extent; great part of it con&s;i&s;ting in dreary wa&s;tes of &s;and, de&s;ert, fore&s;t, and mora&s;s. Many parts of it are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by people who are, in all re&s;pects, dif|ferent from the native Mu&s;covites. The kingdom of Siberia, including the province of Dauria, was originally peopled with Tartars, who lived in little hordes or tribes, under di&s;tinct governments, and &s;hifted their habitations occa&s;ionally: but &s;ince the e&s;tabli&s;hment of Ru&s;&s;ian colonies in the&s;e countries, they have learned to dwell in hou&s;es, to till the ground, and pay an annual tribute of furs to the Czar, or Emperor. There are other Tartars, how|ever, who &s;till live in tents, leading a vagrant life, without acknowledging the Czar's &s;overeignty. Ca&s;an and A&s;tracan were Tartarean kingdoms, and &s;till contain a great number of the&s;e people, though they are not allowed to re&s;ide within the cities which have been built by the Mu&s;covites. A large tract of land, between Ni&s;e-Novogorod and Ca&s;an, on both &s;ides of the river Volga, is occupied by the Zeremi&s;&s;es and Morduars, who live peaceably, employing them&s;elves in agriculture, and pay taxes like the other &s;ubjects of Ru&s;&s;ia; but they never furni&s;h recruits for the army. From Ca&s;an to the frontiers of Siberia the country is inhabited by the Ba&s;kirs, a powerful nation, who have &s;ome villages, and enjoy certain privileges, of which they are very tenacious. The re&s;t of this tract, as far as A&s;tracan and the frontiers of the U&s;becks, is fre|quented by the wandering Khalmucks, who re|move with their tents, according to the &s;ea&s;on, for the convenience of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. They receive an|nually
<PB N="302" REF="3150">
from the Czar pre&s;ents of cloth, money, and arms, in return for which they are obliged to &s;erve in his army without pay. This, however, is ill &s;aved; for they plunder friend and foe, without di&s;tinction; and are, on the whole, barbarous, brutal, and &s;avagely cruel. The Co&s;&s;acks are di&s;|tingui&s;hed into three tribes, known by the places where they made their fir&s;t &s;ettlements; though they are all of the &s;ame nation, &s;peak the &s;ame language, profe&s;s the &s;ame religion, and live un|der the &s;ame form of government. They were originally Poli&s;h pea&s;ants, formed into a militia, under their own officers, and po&s;ted in the Ukraine, to &s;ecure the frontiers of the Republic again&s;t the incur&s;ions of the Tartars. In proce&s;s of time they took arms again&s;t the Poli&s;h nobility, who treated them like &s;laves, and &s;everal battles en&s;ued. The Co&s;&s;acks being wor&s;ted in one of the fir&s;t engage|ments, a certain number of them retired to the unfrequented banks of the Don, or Tanais, where they e&s;tabli&s;hed a colony. In the year 1637, an|other detachment, re&s;olving to penetrate as far as the Ca&s;pian Sea, were per&s;uaded to join their coun|trymen on the Don, in an attempt upon A&s;oph, which they accordingly reduced; but the Turks approaching with a great army, they abandoned the place, after having reduced it to a&s;hes; and built the town of Circa&s;ky on an i&s;land in the Don, putting them&s;elves under the protection of the Mu&s;covites. Their &s;ettlement &s;oon increa&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, that they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed thirty-nine towns on both &s;ides of the river, from Rybna to A&s;oph. The country is fruitful; but they &s;ow very little corn. They feed mo&s;tly on fi&s;h, fle&s;h, and fruits. Their wealth con&s;i&s;ts in cattle, hor&s;es, dromeda|ries, and camels. They are more neat in their hou&s;es and garb than the Mu&s;covites. They pro|fe&s;s the Greek religion, and delight in arms, which
<PB N="303" REF="3160">
they exerci&s;e occa&s;ionally again&s;t the Khalmuck, Cuban, and Crim Tartars; and, in time of war, harra&s;s the Turks on the <HI>Palus Moeotis.</HI> Their go|vernment is military and democratic. Their chief hetman, or general, re&s;ides at Circa&s;ky; is elected by the captains and civil officers of the nation, confirmed by the Czar, and enjoys his employ|ment for life. Every town is like a &s;eparate com|monwealth, ruled by its own hetman, who is an|nually cho&s;en, and acts as captain of his own com|munity. The&s;e Co&s;&s;acks enjoy their own laws and cu&s;toms: they neither pay tribute, nor furni&s;h re|cruits; but are bound to appear in arms at their own charge, when &s;ummoned by the czar of Mu&s;|covy. In the reign of Peter they revolted, on ac|count of &s;ome grievances, and were not reduced without great difficulty. Many of their towns were burned, and the inhabitants ma&s;&s;acred, with|out di&s;tinction of age or &s;ex; &s;o that now their number is greatly dimini&s;hed. The Co&s;&s;acks of the Ukraine are much more numerous and con&s;i|derable; their dominions extending &s;everal hun|dred miles, between the rivers Nieper and Don. In the year 1654, they and their hetman revolted from Poland, and had recour&s;e to the Czar's pro|tection, which they purcha&s;ed by ceding to him Chioff, Czernichoff, and &s;everal other &s;trong places, as pledges of their fidelity. Their coun|try is populous, and well cultivated, abounding with fortified towns, and large villages, neatly built of wood. They carry on a con&s;iderable traf|fick in hemp, pot-a&s;hes, wax, corn, and cattle, and claim the &s;ame privileges that are enjoyed by the Don Co&s;&s;acks. The Mu&s;covite nobility having encroached upon their liberties, their chief, Ma|zeppa, revolted to Charles XII. king of Sweden. But they had concerted their mea&s;ures &s;o ill, that their town of Bathurin was burned, and &s;ix thou|&s;and
<PB N="304" REF="3170">
of the inhabitants put to the &s;word. Another colony of the&s;e people, known by the name of the Zaparovian Co&s;&s;acks, who &s;ettled about the falls of the river Nieper, or Bory&s;thenes, declared for Mazeppa, when their brethren of the Ukraine were afraid to &s;tir. Three thou&s;and followed his fortune to Bender, and engaged in the &s;ervice of Sweden: the re&s;t were cut in pieces.</P>

<P>The empire of Ru&s;&s;ia, including all the&s;e dif|ferent nations, is not &s;uppo&s;ed to contain above &s;even millions of &s;ouls, the bulk of which number is compo&s;ed by the native Ru&s;&s;ians; a people whom we &s;hall now endeavour to de&s;cribe.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians are &s;tigmatized by their neigh|bours as an ignorant brutal people, totally re&s;igned to &s;loth, and addicted to drunkenne&s;s, even in the mo&s;t bea&s;tly exce&s;s: nay, they are accu&s;ed of being arbitrary, perfidious, inhuman, and de&s;titute of every &s;ocial virtue. The &s;everity of the country they inhabit, their want of letters, polity, and commercial intercour&s;e, joined to the de&s;poti&s;m of their government, and the tyranny of the grandees, may doubtle&s;s have an unhappy effect on the di&s;|po&s;itions and morals of the people, which, how|ever, have been meliorated and improved by the care, a&s;&s;iduity, and example of &s;ome of their late &s;overeigns. Certain it is, the vice of drunkenne&s;s was &s;o univer&s;ally prevalent among them, that Peter I. was obliged to re&s;train it by very &s;evere edicts, which however have not produced much effect. They numbered in the city of Mo&s;cow no fewer than four thou&s;and brandy-&s;hops, in which the inhabitants u&s;ed to &s;ot away their time in drink|ing &s;trong liquors, and &s;moaking tobacco. This la&s;t practice became &s;o dangerous among per&s;ons, in the mo&s;t bea&s;tly &s;tate of intoxication, that a very
<PB N="305" REF="3180">
&s;evere law was found nece&s;&s;ary to prevent the per|nicious con&s;equences, otherwi&s;e the whole city might have been con&s;umed by conflagrations.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;covites boa&s;t of their being de&s;cended from the Greeks, though they have no good rea|&s;on to give in &s;upport of this preten&s;ion. The nobility were heretofore very powerful, each com|manding a great number of va&s;&s;als, whom they ruled with the mo&s;t de&s;potic and barbarous autho|rity: but their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions have been gradually cir|cum&s;cribed, and their power transferred in a great mea&s;ure to the Czar, on whom they are now wholly dependant. At pre&s;ent there is no other degree of the nobility, but that of the boyars: the&s;e are admitted to the council, and from among them the waivodes, governors, and other great officers, are nominated. A Ru&s;&s;ian boyar is very proud of being corpulent, believing that nothing gives &s;uch a dignified air as does a broad face, or portly belly. Their &s;urnames are no other than patronimics: for examples, the &s;on of Alexis calls him&s;elf Alexio|witz. They formerly wore long beards, and long robes, with &s;trait &s;leeves dangling down to their ancles: their collars and &s;hirts were generally wrought with &s;ilk of different colours: in lieu of hats, they covered their heads with furred caps; and, in&s;tead of &s;hoes, wore red or yellow leathern bu&s;kins. The dre&s;s of the women nearly re|&s;embled that of the other &s;ex, with this difference, that their garments were more loo&s;e, their caps fanta&s;tical, and their &s;hift-&s;leeves three or four ells in length, gathered up in folds from the &s;houlder to the fore-arm. By this time, however, the French fa&s;hions prevail among the better &s;ort throughout all Mu&s;covy.</P>
<P>The common people are generally tall, healthy, and robu&s;t, patient of cold and hunger, inured to hard&s;hip, and remarkably capable of bearing the

mo&s;t &s;udden tran&s;ition from the extremes of hot or cold weather. Nothing is more cu&s;tomary than to &s;ee a Ru&s;&s;ian, who is over-heated and &s;weating at every pore, &s;trip him&s;elf naked, and plunge into a river: nay, when their pores are all opened in the hot bath, to which they have daily recour&s;e, they either practi&s;e this immer&s;ion, or &s;ubject them&s;elves to a di&s;charge of &s;ome pailfuls of cold water. This is the cu&s;tom both of men and wo|men, who enter the baths promi&s;cuou&s;ly, and ap|pear naked to each other, without &s;cruple or he&s;i|tation.</P>
<P>A Ru&s;&s;ian will &s;ub&s;i&s;t for many days upon a little oatmeal and water, and even raw roots: an onion is a regale; but the food they generally u&s;e in their journeys is a kind of rye-bread, cut into &s;mall &s;quare pieces, and dried again in the oven: the&s;e, when they are hungry, they &s;oak in water, and eat as a very comfortable repa&s;t. Both &s;exes are re|markably healthy and robu&s;t, and accu&s;tom them|&s;elves to &s;leep every day after dinner.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian women are remarkably fair, comely, &s;trong, and well-&s;haped, obedient to their lordly hu&s;bands, and patient under di&s;cipline: they are even &s;aid to be fond of correction, which they con|&s;ider as an infallible mark of their hu&s;bands con|jugal affection; and they pout and pine if it be with-held, as if they thought them&s;elves treated with contempt and di&s;regard. Of this neglect, however, they have very little cau&s;e to complain; the Ru&s;&s;ian hu&s;band is &s;o very well di&s;po&s;ed, by nature and inebriation, to exert his arbitrary power. Some writers ob&s;erve, that, on the wedding-day, the bride pre&s;ents the bridegroom with a whip of her own making, in token of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion; and this he fails not to employ as the in&s;trument of his au|thority. Very little ceremony is here u&s;ed in match-making, which is the work of the parents.
<PB N="307" REF="3200">
Perhaps the bridegroom never &s;ees the woman, un|til he is joined to her for life. The marriage being propo&s;ed, and agreed to, the lady is examined, &s;tark naked, by a certain number of her female relations; and if they find any bodily defect, they endeavour to cure it by their own &s;kill and expe|rience. This is a very wi&s;e and laudable cu&s;tom, which, if it prevailed in other parts of Europe, would prevent many unhappy marriages. The bride, on her wedding-day, is crowned with a gar|land of wormwood, implying the bitterne&s;s that often attends the married &s;tate: when the prie&s;t has tied the nuptial knot at the altar, his clerk or &s;exton throws upon her head an handful of hops, wi&s;hing that &s;he may prove as fruitful as the plant thus &s;cattered. She is muffled up, and led home by a certain number of old women, the pari&s;h|prie&s;t carrying the cro&s;s before; while one of his &s;ubalterns, in a rough goat-&s;kin, prays all the way, that &s;he may bear as many children as there are hairs on his garment. The new-married couple, being &s;eated at table, are pre&s;ented with bread and &s;alt; and a chorus of boys and girls &s;ing the epi|thalamium, which is always gro&s;ly ob&s;cene. This ceremony being performed, the bride and bride|groom are conducted to their own chamber by an old woman, who exhorts the wife to obey her hu&s;|band, and retires. Then the bridegroom de&s;ires the lady to pull off one of his bu&s;kins, giving her to under&s;tand, that in one of them is contained a whip, and in the other a jewel, or a pur&s;e of money. She takes her choice; and if &s;he finds the pur&s;e, interprets it into a good omen; whereas &s;hould &s;he light on the whip, &s;he con&s;trues it into an unhappy pre&s;age, and in&s;tantly receives a la&s;h, as a &s;pecimen of what &s;he has to expect. After they have remained two hours together, they are interrupted by a deputation of old women, who
<PB N="308" REF="3210">
come to &s;earch for the &s;igns of her virginity: if the&s;e are apparent, the young lady ties up her hair, which, before con&s;ummation, hung loo&s;e over her &s;houlders; and vi&s;its her mother, of whom &s;he demands the marriage-portion. It is generally agreed, that the Mu&s;covite hu&s;bands are barbar|ous, even to a proverb: they not only admini&s;ter frequent and &s;evere correction to their wives, but &s;ometimes even torture them to death, without being &s;ubject to any puni&s;hment for the murder. If a woman dies, in con&s;equence of the correction &s;he has received from her hu&s;band, the law of Ru&s;&s;ia interprets it not an offence, but an accident. A trade&s;man of Mo&s;cow has been known to burn his wife to death, by &s;etting fire to a &s;mock which had been &s;oaked in &s;pirits of wine; and no cogni|zance was taken of the murder. A man &s;ome|times ties up his wife to a beam by the hair of her head, and &s;courges her to death: but &s;uch puni&s;h|ments have been re&s;erved for tho&s;e who were guil|ty of adultery or drunkenne&s;s, &s;eldom inflicted, and now wholly laid a&s;ide. Indeed precautions are commonly taken again&s;t &s;uch barbarous practices by the marriage-articles, in which the bridegroom obliges him&s;elf, under certain penalties, to treat his wife according to her quality, &s;upply her with good and whol&s;ome provi&s;ion, and to refrain from manual cha&s;ti&s;ement, either by whipping, boxing, kicking, or &s;cratching. If a woman, provoked by hard u&s;age, takes away the life of her hu&s;band, a ca&s;e that &s;ometimes happens, &s;he is fixed alive in the earth, up to her neck, and in this po&s;ture &s;uf|fered to die of hunger: a puni&s;hment incredibly &s;hocking, under which &s;ome of tho&s;e wretched objects langui&s;h for &s;everal days in the mo&s;t dread|ful mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>The canon law of Mu&s;covy forbids the conjugal commerce on Mondays, Wedne&s;days, and Fridays;
<PB N="309" REF="3220">
and whoever trangre&s;&s;es this law, mu&s;t bathe him|&s;elf before he enters the church-porch. He that marries a &s;econd wife, the fir&s;t being alive, is not admitted farther than the church-door; and if any man e&s;pou&s;es a third, he is excommunicated: &s;o that though bigamy is tolerated, they neverthele&s;s count it infamous. If a woman is barren, the hu&s;|band generally per&s;uades her to retire into a con|vent: if fair means will not &s;ucceed, he is at li|berty to whip her into conde&s;cen&s;ion. If, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, the wife had the privilege of demanding a fair &s;crutiny, perhaps the hu&s;band would often ap|pear impotent, in&s;tead of the woman's being found barren. When the Czar, or Emperor, has an inclination for a wife, the mo&s;t beautiful maidens of the empire are pre&s;ented to him for his choice.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the arbitrary power and brutal di&s;po&s;ition of the Mu&s;covite hu&s;bands, the women are &s;aid to be very free of their favours, and even to tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of conjugal fidelity, in or|der to incur the re&s;entment of their hu&s;bands, when the whip is too &s;paringly admini&s;tred. This di&s;|cipline took its origin, many centuries ago, among the Scythian Sarmates, the ance&s;tors of the Mu&s;|covites. The&s;e people, going in que&s;t of a better &s;ettlement, left their wives under the care of their &s;laves, and made an irruption into Greece, part of which they &s;ubdued. The&s;e conque&s;ts, however, detained them &s;o long, that the women, de&s;pairing of their return, married the &s;laves, who were &s;trong enough to make head again&s;t their ma&s;ters, when at length they returned from Greece. Both &s;ides were already drawn up in order of battle, when one of the Sarmatians, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to his fellows, ob&s;erved, that they &s;hould deba&s;e them|&s;elves by u&s;ing the &s;word and &s;pear again&s;t &s;laves, whom they had formerly over-awed with the &s;ound of a whip: he therefore propo&s;ed, that every man
<PB N="310" REF="3230">
&s;hould arm him&s;elf with this weapon only: the advice was immediately pur&s;ued, and they attacked the enemy with &s;courges. The &s;laves had been &s;o accu&s;tomed to dread this in&s;trument, that they were in&s;tantly &s;eized with a panic, and fled with the utmo&s;t precipitation. The pri&s;oners were pu|ni&s;hed with death, and great part of the women made away with them&s;elves: the re&s;t &s;ubmitted to fla|gellation, which was &s;everely exerci&s;ed. In memory of this event, and as a warning to Mu&s;covite wives, the whip or &s;courge is the fir&s;t wedding pre&s;ent, and hung up in the mo&s;t con&s;picuous part of the hou&s;e, that, by pre&s;enting it&s;elf continually to the good woman's eyes, it may never &s;lip from her re|membrance.</P>
<P>The education of the Czarowitz, or prince royal, is intru&s;ted to the care of a few per&s;ons, by whom he is &s;trictly kept from the eyes of the vulgar, un|til he hath attained the fifteenth year of his age: then he is publickly expo&s;ed in the market-place, that the people, by viewing him attentively, may remember his per&s;on, in order to a&s;certain his iden|tity; for they have more than once been deceived by impo&s;tors.</P>
<P>Such is the &s;lavery in which the Mu&s;covites of both &s;exes are kept by their parents, their patrons, and the emperor, that they are not allowed to di&s;pute any match that may be provided for them by the&s;e directors, how&s;oever di&s;agreeable or odious it may be. Officers of the greate&s;t rank in the army, both natives and foreigners, have been &s;ad|dled with wives by the &s;overeign in this arbitrary manner. A great general, lately decea&s;ed, who was a native of Britain, having been pre&s;&s;ed by the reigning Czarina to wed one of her ladies, &s;aved him&s;elf from a very di&s;agreeable marriage, by pretending his con&s;titution was &s;o un&s;ound,
<PB N="311" REF="3240">
that the lady would be irreparably injured by his compliance.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;covites are fond of the bagpipe, and have a kind of violin, with a large belly, like that of a lute: but their mu&s;ick is very barbarous and defective. Neverthele&s;s there are public &s;chools, in which the children are regularly taught to &s;ing. The very beggars a&s;k alms in a whining cadence and ridiculous &s;ort of recitative. <Q>A Ru&s;&s;ian am|ba&s;&s;ador at the Hague, having been regaled with the be&s;t concert of vocal and in&s;trumental mu&s;ick that could be procured, was a&s;ked how he liked the entertainment, and replied, &startq;Perfectly well: the beggars in my country &s;ing ju&s;t in the &s;ame manner.&endq;</Q> The warlike mu&s;ick of the Ru&s;&s;ians con&s;i&s;ts in kettledrums and trumpets: they like|wi&s;e u&s;e hunting-horns; but they are not at all expert in the performance. The Mu&s;covites think it is beneath them to dance; but they call in their Poli&s;h or Tartarean &s;laves to divert them with this exerci&s;e, in their hours of di&s;&s;ipation.</P>

<HEAD>LANGUAGE, and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Mu&s;covites &s;peak a dialect of the old Scla|vonic, mixed with barbari&s;ms from the Poli&s;h and other languages: but the pure Sclavonic is &s;till retained in their Bibles and Homilies, and even &s;poken by tho&s;e who affect to be thought men of letters. The Ru&s;&s;ians have adopted the Greek characters, which, however, they have corrupted and altered in the &s;hape, and increa&s;ed the letters to the number of thirty-eight. The whole empire was overwhelmed with the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ignorance: in|deed human learning was in &s;o little reque&s;t, that the nobility them&s;elves were wholly illiterate; and even the clergy could hardly read their prayers. They had neither univer&s;ity nor &s;chool for the in|&s;truction
<PB N="312" REF="3250">
of youth, until Peter, their great re|former, in &s;ome mea&s;ure di&s;pelled tho&s;e clouds of ignorance, by inviting foreigners into his domi|nions, encouraging the liberal arts and &s;ciences, obliging his nobles to &s;end their &s;ons to more civi|lized countries for their improvement, and in&s;ti|tuting academies and &s;eminaries in Mo&s;cow and Peter&s;burg. The&s;e &s;teps were &s;o contrary to the natural di&s;po&s;ition of the Mu&s;covites, that no other prince could have taken them with any pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s. Nay, &s;ince the death of this great man, they &s;eem returning to their old bigotry. Fo|reigners are di&s;couraged at the court of Peter&s;|burg; a gaudy tin&s;el pomp is &s;ub&s;tituted in the room of real grandeur and magnificence; little or no progre&s;s has been made in pro&s;ecuting the wi&s;e plans projected by the czar Peter; and perhaps the whole nation will relap&s;e into its pri&s;tine barbarity: though &s;uch a relap&s;e can hardly happen, con&s;ider|ing the great commerce with different nations which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be carried on at Peter&s;burg, and other Ru&s;&s;ian ports in the Baltic.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians were converted to the chri&s;tian religion towards the latter end of the tenth cen|tury, by a bi&s;hop and &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tics, &s;ent with a grand emba&s;&s;y by Ba&s;ilius, emperor of Con&s;tan|tinople, to Voldomir, duke of Ru&s;&s;ia. Since that period they have confe&s;&s;ed the articles of the Greek church, mingled with certain &s;uper&s;titious cere|monies of their own. They do not believe in tran&s;ub&s;tantiation, purgatory, or the pope's infal|libility, or &s;upremacy: they u&s;e auricular confe&s;|&s;ion, communicate in both kinds, adopt the Atha|na&s;ian creed, and adhere to the e&s;tabli&s;hed liturgy of St. Ba&s;il. They wor&s;hip the Virgin Mary, and other &s;aints, and pay their adorations to cro&s;&s;es and reliques. They ob&s;erve four great fa&s;ts in the year, during which they ta&s;te neither fi&s;h, fle&s;h,
<PB N="313" REF="3260">
nor any animal production: they will not drink after a man who has eaten fle&s;h, nor u&s;e a knife that has cut meat in le&s;s than twenty-four hours after it has been u&s;ed; nor will they, even though their health is at &s;take, touch any thing in which hart&s;horn, or any animal &s;ub&s;tance, has been in|fu&s;ed. While this kind of Lent continues, they &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon cabbage, cucumbers, and rye-bread, drinking nothing &s;tronger than a &s;ort of &s;mall beer, called qua&s;&s;i. They likewi&s;e fa&s;t every Wedne&s;day and Friday. Their common penance is to ab&s;tain from every &s;pecies of food and drink, but bread, &s;alt, cucumbers, and water. They are ordered to bend their bodies, and continue in that painful po&s;ture, and, between whiles, to &s;trike their heads again&s;t an image.</P>
<P>The Mu&s;covites, at all times, reject as impure hor&s;efle&s;h, elk, veal, hare, rabbit, a&s;s's milk, mare's milk, Venice treacle, becau&s;e the fle&s;h of vipers is an ingredient, and every thing that contains even the &s;malle&s;t quantity of mu&s;k, civer, and ca&s;tor; yet they have no aver&s;ion to &s;wine's fle&s;h: on the contrary, the country produces excellent bacon. Six thou&s;and flitches were con&s;umed in one of the Czar's magazines, which was burned by accident.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians celebrate fifteen grand fe&s;tivals in the year. On Palm-&s;unday there is a magnificent proce&s;&s;ion, at which the Czar a&s;&s;i&s;ts in per&s;on and on foot. He is apparelled in cloath of gold: his train is borne up by the prime of the nobility, and he is attended by his whole court. He is imme|diately preceded by the officers of his hou&s;hold, one of whom carries his handkerchief on his arm, lying upon another of the riche&s;t embroidery. He halts at a &s;ort of platform of free-&s;tone, where, turning to the ea&s;t, and bending his body almo&s;t
<PB N="314" REF="3270">
double, he pronounces a &s;hort prayer: then he proceeds to the church of Jeru&s;alem, where he re|news his devotion. This exerci&s;e being performed, he returns to his palace, the bridle of the patri|arch's hor&s;e re&s;ting upon his arm. The hor&s;e's head, being covered with white linnen, is held by &s;ome nobleman; while the patriarch, &s;itting &s;ide|ways, and holding a cro&s;s in his hand, di&s;tributes benedictions as he moves along: on his head he wears a cap edged with ermine, adorned with loops and buttons of gold, and precious &s;tones: before him are di&s;played banners of con&s;ecrated &s;tuff, in a variety of colours. Above five hundred prie&s;ts walk in the proce&s;&s;ion; tho&s;e who are near the patriarch bearing pictures of the Virgin Mary, richly ornamented with gold, jewels, and pearls, together with cro&s;&s;es, reliques, and religious books, including a copy of the Go&s;pels, which they reckon to be of ine&s;timable value. In the mid&s;t of this proce&s;&s;ion is borne a triumphal arch, and on the top an apple-tree covered with fruit, which &s;everal little boys, inclo&s;ed in the machine, endea|vour to gather. The lawyers and laity carry branches of willow, the guards and the &s;pectators pro&s;trate them&s;elves on the ground, while the pro|ce&s;&s;ion halts; and, after the ceremony, the patri|arch pre&s;ents a pur&s;e of an hundred rubles to the Czar, who perhaps invites him to dine at his table. <Q>During the &s;ea&s;on of Ea&s;ter the whole empire is filled with mirth and rejoicing: at meeting they &s;ay, &startq;Chri&s;t is ri&s;en;&endq;</Q> <Q>and the an&s;wer is, &startq;Yea, he is ri&s;en.&endq;</Q> They pre&s;ent one another with eggs, finely painted: &s;uch are the pre&s;ents made by the patriarch to tho&s;e per&s;ons, of the fir&s;t qua|lity, who have the honour to ki&s;s his hand on this &s;olemn occa&s;ion. Their mirth and rejoicing, how|ever, never fails to degenerate into heat and de|bauchery:

They plunge the child three times over head and ears in water, and give it the &s;acrament of the Lord's Supper in one &s;pe|cies, until it hath attained the age of &s;even; after which the child is indulged with it in both kinds. They likewi&s;e admini&s;ter the &s;acrament to dying per&s;ons, together with Extreme Unction; and, if this be neglected, the body is denied chri&s;tian burial. Soon as the per&s;on expires, the body is depo&s;ited in a coffin, with a luncheon of bread, a pair of &s;hoes, &s;ome few pieces of money, and a certificate &s;igned by the pari&s;h-prie&s;t, and directed to St. Nicholas, who is one of their great patrons. They likewi&s;e hold St. Andrew in great veneration, and ridiculou&s;ly pretend they were converted by him to Chri&s;tianity. But, next to St. Nicholas, they adore St. Anthony of Padua, who is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;ailed upon a mill-&s;tone through the Medi|terranean and Atlantic, and over the lakes Ladoga and Onega, as far as Novogorod. Every hou&s;e is furni&s;hed with an image of St. Nicholas, carved in the mo&s;t rude and fanta&s;tic manner; <Q>and when it becomes old and worm-eaten, the owner either throws it into the river with a few pieces of coin,

&s;aying, &startq;Adieu, Brother;&endq;</Q> or returns it to the maker, who accommodates him with a new image for a proper con&s;ideration. The good women are very careful in adorning their private St. Nichola&s;es with rich cloaths and jewels; but, on any emer|gency, the&s;e are re&s;umed, and the &s;aint left as naked as he came from the hands of the carpenter.</P>
<P>There are mona&s;teries in Ru&s;&s;ia; but neither the monks nor the nuns are &s;ubject to &s;evere re&s;tric|tions. The friars are either hor&s;e-jockeys, or trade in hops, wheat, and other commodities: the &s;i&s;ters are at liberty to go abroad when they plea&s;e, and indulge them&s;elves in all manner of freedoms.</P>
<P>Heretofore liberty of con&s;cience was denied, and every convicted heretick was committed to the flames; but &s;ince the reign of Peter all religions and &s;ects are tolerated throughout the empire. Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, Arme|nians, Jews, and Mahometans, enjoy the free ex|erci&s;e of their re&s;pective forms of wor&s;hip: though it was not without great difficulty, and by dint of extraordinary &s;olicitation from different powers, that the Romi&s;h religion was allowed. Peter, knowing the dangerous tenets of a religion that might &s;et the &s;piritual power of the pope at va|riance with the temporal power of the emperor, and being well acquainted with the meddling ge|nius of its profe&s;&s;ors, held out for &s;ome time again&s;t the interce&s;&s;ion of Germany, France, and Poland; and though at length he yielded to their joint interpo&s;ition, he would by no means &s;uffer any je&s;uit to enter his dominions.</P>
<P>The government of the church of Ru&s;&s;ia was formerly ve&s;ted in a patriarch, archbi&s;hops, and bi&s;hops; and this patriarch was ordained by him of Con&s;tantinople, till about the latter end of the &s;ixteenth century, when Hieronymo, patriarch of Con&s;tantinople, having been degraded by the Greek
<PB N="317" REF="3300">
clergy for his &s;candalous morals, repaired to Mo&s;|cow. There, in con&s;ideration of a &s;um of money offered to him by the czar Theodore Iwanowitz, he re&s;igned his patriarchal dignity to Jacob, metro|politan of Ru&s;&s;ia. He, in the church of the ble&s;&s;ed Virgin, after a laboured harangue, delivered the &s;taff and tiara to Jacob in public; and afterwards confirmed this tran&s;action by a writing under his own hand and &s;eal, which was carefully depo&s;ited among the archives of the cathedral. As Hiero|nymo had been formally and legally degraded, he had no right to convey a dignity of which he was no longer po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed: neverthele&s;s, the Czar payed the price he demanded, in order to &s;ave to his &s;ub|jects a con&s;iderable &s;um of money, which was an|nually remitted to Con&s;tantinople, by way of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical tribute: he accordingly authenticated the election of Jacob, and the Ru&s;&s;ian clergy ac|quie&s;ced in the alteration. Since that period they have acknowledged none but their own patriarch. Be&s;ides the patriarch, there were four archbi&s;hops; one of Novogorod Veliki, another of Ro&s;tow, a third of Ca&s;an, and a fourth at Scar&s;cow. This hierarchy was, in effect, equal to the papal power in the Mu&s;covite dominions, and therefore gave umbrage to Peter the Great; who, upon the death of the la&s;t incumbent, declared that no other pre|late &s;hould be rai&s;ed to that dignity, but that he him&s;elf would be &s;upreme head of the Ru&s;&s;ian church. Such violent oppo&s;ition was made to this &s;cheme, that Peter, in order to intimidate the clergy, ordered the metropolitan of Re&s;an to de|grade one of the bi&s;hops; and this &s;acrifice terri|fied the re&s;t into compliance. The Czar, in con|&s;equence of the character he a&s;&s;umed, began forth|with to reform his clergy, who were gro&s;ly igno|rant. In&s;tead of preaching to their congregations, they u&s;ed to read &s;hort homilies of the Greek &s;aints,
<PB N="318" REF="3310">
&s;ing a p&s;alm or hymm, and conclude the &s;ervice with the Athana&s;ian creed and the Litany. Peter introduced learning into the church; obliged the illiterate to &s;tudy, and every beneficed eccle&s;ia&s;tic to preach &s;ermons of his own compo&s;ing. Their churches are built in the Greek fa&s;hion, and adorned with pictures. Image-wor&s;hip was formerly al|lowed; but now is counted idolatry: neither genu|flexion before images, nor the u&s;e of mu&s;ical in|&s;truments, is permitted in the church of Ru&s;&s;ia. Every prie&s;t is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Papa, or Father: he keeps the crown of his head always clo&s;e &s;haven, lets his beard grow, wears a red leather cap on his head, and two &s;tripes of &s;tuff pinned or tacked on each &s;ide of the brea&s;t. He is allowed to wed one woman; but, &s;hould he &s;ur|vive her, he mu&s;t lead the re&s;t of his life in a &s;tate of widowhood. In con&s;equence of this regulation, the prie&s;t's wife is commonly u&s;ed with great ten|derne&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>GOVERNMENT and LAWS.</HEAD>
<P>The government of Ru&s;&s;ia is meer de&s;poti&s;m. The whole empire is ruled by the arbitrary will and plea&s;ure of the &s;overeign, who is &s;tiled the Czar, a title which is probably a corruption of Cae|&s;ar. Heretofore he was &s;tyled Grand Duke of Mu&s;covy: but &s;ince the reign of Peter he is dig|nified with the appellation of Emperor of Ru&s;&s;ia.
<PB N="319" REF="3320">
He is ab&s;olute lord, not only of all the e&s;tates in the empire, but al&s;o of the lives of his &s;ubjects: the greate&s;t <HI>knez,</HI> or noblemen, call them&s;elves his <HI>galopes,</HI> or &s;laves, and execute his commands with the mo&s;t implicit obedience. The common people revere him as &s;omething &s;upernatural: they never mention his name, or any thing immediately be|longing to him, without marks of the mo&s;t pro|found re&s;pect and awful veneration. <Q>A man a&s;k|ing a carpenter, at work upon one of the Czar's warehou&s;es, what the place was intended for, an|&s;wered, &startq;None but God and the Czar knows.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The nobility of Ru&s;&s;ia were formerly rich and powerful, and ruled de&s;potically over their infe|riors: but their wealth and influence are now &s;wal|lowed up by the importance and authority of the crown, and they are become venal dependants on the government. The Czar appoints waivodes, or governors of provinces; and be&s;tows all offices of con&s;equence, whether eccle&s;ia&s;tical, civil, or military. In a word, he is ve&s;ted with the whole legi&s;lative and executive power, and all his &s;ubjects are &s;laves, exi&s;ting at his will.</P>
<P>The people of Ru&s;&s;ia are di&s;tingui&s;hed into three degrees; namely, the nobility, called knez, or kneas; the gentry, known by the name of duor|nins; and the pea&s;ants. The knez, or dukes, were antiently the palatines of Ru&s;&s;ia, who exer|ci&s;ed &s;upreme power, each in his own territory, as an independent prince; but all of them either &s;ubmitted, or were &s;ubdued by the princes of Vol|domir, who tran&s;lated their re&s;idence to Mo&s;cow, and a&s;&s;umed the title of Weliki Kneas, or Great Duke. The de&s;cendants of the&s;e noblemen &s;till retain their antient appellation, though many of them are reduced to the mo&s;t abject poverty and contempt. In the beginning of this century above three hundred knez &s;erved as common troopers in
<PB N="320" REF="3330">
the regiment of dragoons commanded by prince Menzikoff. The czar Peter introduced the titles of Count and Prince of the Empire, and in&s;tituted an order of kinghthood in honour of St. Andrew, di&s;tingui&s;hed by a blue ribbon and &s;tar, in imita|tion of the Garter. The Duormins are country gentlemen, who generally hold their lands by knight's &s;ervice; and, in time of war, are obliged to appear in arms on hor&s;eback. Tho&s;e are the mo&s;t happy who live at the greate&s;t di&s;tance from court, becau&s;e there they may enjoy their e&s;tates, unknown and unmole&s;ted. In general, they are extremely in&s;olent and oppre&s;&s;ive to the pea&s;ants, and meanly &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to the nobility.</P>
<P>All the pea&s;ants in the empire are con&s;idered as immediate &s;laves belonging to the Czar, to the boyars, or to the mona&s;teries. The value of e&s;tates is computed not by the extent or quality of the land, but from the number of tho&s;e pea&s;ants, who may be &s;old, alienated, or given away, at the plea|&s;ure of their ma&s;ters. The number of the&s;e hu&s;|bandmen, whether living in villages, or in the open country, being known, the Czar, by re|quiring a certain proportion of each lord or pro|prietor, can rai&s;e three hundred thou&s;and men in le&s;s than forty days.</P>
<P>The admini&s;tration is managed by a grand coun|cil, called Dumnoy Boyaren, or Council of the Boyars, who are the grandees of the empire, and act as privy coun&s;ellors. To this are &s;ub&s;ervient &s;ix inferiors chambers and courts of judicature, provided each with a pre&s;ident. The fir&s;t regu|lates every thing relating to amba&s;&s;adors, and fo|reign negotiations: the &s;econd takes cognizance of military affairs: the third manages the public revenues of the empire: the bu&s;ine&s;s of the fourth is to encourage, protect, and improve trade and
<PB N="321" REF="3340">
commerce. The two la&s;t hear and determine in all cau&s;es, whether civil or criminal.</P>
<P>Peter divided the empire into the eight govern|ments of Mo&s;co, Archangel, A&s;oph, Ca&s;an, and A&s;tracan, Chioff and the Ukraine, Siberia, Livo|nia, comprehending Ingria, Ple&s;cow, and Novo|gorod, Smolen&s;ko, and Veronitz. The governors or waivodes were ve&s;ted with power to di&s;po&s;e of all employments, civil and military, and receive the revenues. They were directed to defray all expences in their re&s;pective governments, and &s;end a certain yearly &s;um to the great trea&s;ury. In a word, they enjoyed ab&s;olute power in every thing but what related to the regular troops, which, though quartered in their juri&s;diction, were neither payed nor directed by them, but received their orders immediately from the Czar or his generals.</P>
<P>The deci&s;ion of cau&s;es heretofore depended upon the opinion and equity of the judge; but about the middle of the la&s;t century a code of laws was compiled in one volume, intituled, <HI>Sabrona Ulo&s;ci|nia,</HI> &s;ignifying, Univer&s;al Law; and according to this the &s;entences are now regulated.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e tribunals, there is an inferior court of judicature, or proce&s;s, e&s;tabli&s;hed in every pro|vince, having a pre&s;ident, chancellor, and &s;ecre|tary or diack. The law-&s;uits are neither tedious nor expen&s;ive, as all the proceedings are &s;ummary: but the judge is very &s;eldom incorruptible; and, unle&s;s he is tampered with before-hand, the plain|tiff generally obtains the &s;entence in his favour.</P>
<P>Few crimes are capital in Ru&s;&s;ia: murder may be atoned by paying a &s;um of money; nay, the civil magi&s;trate takes no cognizance of murder, without having previou&s;ly received information at the &s;uit of &s;ome individual. No man can be con|victed of a capital crime, except upon his own confe&s;&s;ion: but the means u&s;ed to extort that con|fe&s;&s;ion
<PB N="322" REF="3350">
are &s;uch as human nature can hardly re&s;i&s;t. The pri&s;oner undergoes the &s;courge, the &s;trappado, and the knout; which la&s;t is a puni&s;hment in|flicted with a thong of a buffalo's hide, managed in &s;uch a manner, that the executioner can either cut the &s;carf-&s;kin only, or this and the &s;kin toge|ther, or &s;kin, mu&s;cles, and membranes to the bone, ju&s;t as he is commanded. The mo&s;t &s;evere in|fliction of this puni&s;hment is denominated the Pine: the patient is &s;u&s;pended by his two arms, pulled up behind, until the &s;houlder-joints are di&s;|located; and, in this &s;ituation of unutterable pain, is flead with the knout from the neck to the loins. If the wretched caitiff bears the&s;e tortures without confe&s;&s;ing, his fle&s;hy parts are &s;eared or pierced with red-hot irons: nay, his bones are &s;corched, and his mu&s;cles broiled over a &s;low fire. Should he &s;till per&s;i&s;t in denying the charge, molten lead is poured upon his bare head; and thus the wretch expires.</P>
<P>Traitors, after having undergone the mo&s;t &s;e|vere tortures, are &s;ometimes &s;ent to Siberia with|out their eyes and ears, and often left to peri&s;h on the road.</P>
<P>A coiner is &s;entenced to &s;wallow the molten metal of the coin which he counterfeited.</P>
<P>Hanging was formerly prohibited in Ru&s;&s;ia, from a notion that the &s;oul, being forced through the fundament, could not e&s;cape that way without being defiled: but that objection is now over|ruled, and the Ru&s;&s;ians are hanged occa&s;ionally, like their neighbours. The criminal is obliged to fa&s;ten the noo&s;e about his own neck, and to fling him&s;elf off, at the command of the executioner.</P>
<P>The puni&s;hment decreed again&s;t robbers, thieves, and tho&s;e guilty of common crimes, is &s;courg|ing. Neither &s;odomy nor bea&s;tiality were deemed capital crimes in Ru&s;&s;ia, before the reign of Peter.
<PB N="323" REF="3360">
The&s;e abominable vices were grown to &s;uch a pitch of &s;hamele&s;s brutality, that people did not &s;cruple to practi&s;e them even in the open day.</P>
<P>Every lord or ma&s;ter has a right to inflict the batogs on his &s;ervant: this puni&s;hment con&s;i&s;ts in &s;tretching the offender naked on the ground, and cau&s;ing him to be beaten with &s;ticks by two of his fellows. The inferior officers of &s;tate are &s;ome|times puni&s;hed in this manner, by their &s;uperiors, for little frauds and mi&s;demeanours; and this cor|rection is admini&s;tered arbitrarily, without any form of trial.</P>

<HEAD>The COMMERCE, COIN, REVENUE, and STRENGTH of RUSSIA.</HEAD>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians drive a con&s;iderable traffick with different nations, both of A&s;ia and Europe. One of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable articles is the iron manu|facture, in its different branches of ca&s;t cannon, mortars, bombs, anchors, and &s;mall arms. They have likewi&s;e at Peter&s;burg large magazines of naval &s;tores, leather, tallow, and pot-a&s;hes. The &s;outhern parts furni&s;h great quantities of caviar: the north-ea&s;tern provinces &s;upply plenty of &s;per|ma ceti, &s;ea-hor&s;es teeth, i&s;ingla&s;s, and train-oil; and Ru&s;&s;ia produces an infinite number of the be&s;t furs in the world, together with abundance of honey, ca&s;tor, rhubarb, and &s;ome other drugs.</P>
<P>At the port of Peter&s;burg a thou&s;and &s;hips are loaded yearly, by foreigners, with the commodi|ties produced in the northern parts of this great empire. But the Mu&s;covites likewi&s;e carry on a con&s;iderable commerce by land with China and the Ea&s;t Indies for gold, &s;ilk, tea, and porcelaine. The court monopolizes this trade, and imports the&s;e commodities by caravans of camels.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="3370">
With re&s;pect to the revenue of Ru&s;&s;ia, it conti|nually fluctuates according to the increa&s;e of com|merce, or the plea&s;ure of the Czar, who has all the wealth of the empire at his di&s;po&s;al. He mo|nopolizes all the be&s;t furs, the mines, minerals, and trade by land to the Ea&s;t Indies: he farms out all the tobacco, wine, brandy, beer, mead, and other liquors; the inns, taverns, public hou&s;es, baths, and &s;weating hou&s;es. The cu&s;toms upon merchandize, the impo&s;ts upon corn, and toll ex|acted from cities, towns, and villages, are very con|&s;iderable. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es deme&s;nes to a very great value: he inherits the effects of all tho&s;e that die inte&s;tate, or under accu&s;ation of capital crimes: he derives a duty from all law-&s;uits; and, to &s;um up the whole, can command the fortunes of all his &s;ubjects. All the&s;e articles, added together, are &s;aid to produce about three millions &s;terling: but then the intrin&s;ic value of money is at lea&s;t three times greater in Mu&s;covy than in England. The czar Peter &s;eized the lands of the church, and an|nexed them to his own deme&s;nes; but the greater part was re&s;tored in the &s;equel. As for the lands belonging to the dignity and office of patriarch, they were di&s;tributed among the mona&s;teries and nobility.</P>
<P>The &s;tanding army of Ru&s;&s;ia is computed at two hundred and fifty thou&s;and men: be&s;ides the&s;e, the Ru&s;&s;ians can a&s;&s;emble a body of forty thou&s;and irregulars, Calmucks, Co&s;&s;acks, and other Tar|tars, who live under their dominion. But the number may be doubled on any emergency. The Czarina has likewi&s;e a con&s;iderable fleet in the Bal|tic, amounting to about thirty &s;hips of the line; and a great number of formidable gallies, frigates, fire-&s;hips, and bomb-ketches. This, however, is at pre&s;ent in very indifferent order.</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="3380">
The coins peculiar to Ru&s;&s;ia are the&s;e: the cher|vonitz, a piece of gold, equal in value to a ducat; the ruble, a &s;ilver coin, valued at four &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence; the half and quarter ruble; and the copec, or penny. Rixdollars are likewi&s;e cur|rent through this whole empire.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ians compute their roads by wer&s;ts, one of which is equal to about two thirds of an Engli&s;h mile. Their commodities are weighed by lotes and poods: two and thirty lotes are equal to one pound: forty pounds con&s;titute one pood, and &s;ixty-three poods make one tun: but the Engli&s;h hundred weight generally amounts to one hundred and twenty-three Ru&s;&s;ian pounds and a half.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REFORMATIONS effected by the CZAR PETER.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Ru&s;&s;ia being over&s;pread with fore&s;ts, lakes, rivers, fens, mar&s;hes, and moun|tains, and the ground covered with ice or &s;now for three parts of the year, travelling was equally dif|ficult and dangerous. The accommodations were very bad, and very &s;carce, on account of the great di&s;tance between towns and villages: the roads were almo&s;t impa&s;&s;able: the traveller ran the ri&s;que of being frozen to death, of peri&s;hing by wild bea&s;ts, by water, and precipices, in the winter; and in the &s;ummer was &s;o annoyed by the venom|ous in&s;ects, which breed in the &s;tagnating waters, that nothing could be more dreadful than a long journey. Peter, &s;en&s;ible of the&s;e inconveniences, ordered the roads to be mended; cau&s;ed po&s;ts to be fixed at the end of every mile, in&s;cribed with proper directions; built hou&s;es of entertainment at proper di&s;tances, and improved the carriages or vehicles in which people travel from one city to another. This is a kind of coach, fixed upon a
<PB N="326" REF="3390">
&s;ledge, drawn by hor&s;es with &s;uch di&s;patch, that a man may travel four hundred miles in three days. The coach is provided with a kind of couch, on which the traveller may repo&s;e him&s;elf: the hor&s;es are changed every fifteen miles; and the vehicle proceeds, night and day, from one end of the jour|ney to the other. Sometimes the&s;e &s;leds are drawn upon the ice by rein-deer.</P>
<P>Commodities are either conveyed from one place to another by navigable lakes, rivers, and canals, or upon larger &s;ledges drawn by hor&s;es and dro|medaries; or, la&s;tly, carried on the backs of the&s;e animals.</P>
<P>Peter, having travelled through other countries for his improvement, not only civilized his people, as we have already ob&s;erved, by encouraging arts and &s;ciences, inviting foreigners into his domi|nions, in&s;tituting academies, &s;chools, and &s;emina|ries for youth; building a navy, promoting navi|gation, and extending commerce: but moreover di&s;ciplined his army, which, before his time, was the contempt of his neighbours, until at length it became a match for the mo&s;t warlike forces in Eu|rope. There was indeed, in former reigns, no &s;tanding corps in his dominions, except the Czar's guards, a body of twenty thou&s;and men entertained at Mo&s;cow, under the name of <HI>&s;trelitzes,</HI> re&s;embling the janizaries of Con&s;tantinople in their power, in|&s;olence, and ferocity. A particular quarter was a&s;&s;igned to them at Mo&s;cow, and they enjoyed other privileges that were grievous to the people: they committed violence and outrages with impu|nity: they engaged in cabals; they broke out into mutiny and &s;edition. In a word, they became &s;o ungovernable, licentious, and intolerable, that Pe|ter &s;uppre&s;&s;ed them by dint of force, and in&s;ti|tuted a new body of guards, which he and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have taken care to re&s;train within the
<PB N="327" REF="3400">
limits of proper di&s;cipline. One of the greate&s;t enterprizes which this monarch undertook was the canal of Woronitz, dug between the rivers Don and Wolga, through which the navigation or water-carriage might have been extended above a thou&s;and miles through his dominions, and a com|munication opened between the Baltic, Euxine, and Ca&s;pian &s;eas: but this va&s;t work was inter|rupted, and, for that time, fru&s;trated by the Na|gayan Tartars, who then po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the kingdom of A&s;tracan, as well as by the continual wars and avo|cations in which the emperor was engaged. Con|&s;iderable progre&s;s was made in this canal by Capt. Perry, an Engli&s;h engineer, who was but ill re|warded for his trouble.</P>
<P>Such was the vigour of mind and per&s;everance with which this great reformer pro&s;ecuted his plans of improvement, that a &s;quadron of &s;hips of war was here built, in the middle of his dominions, and &s;ent down the river Don or Tanais into the Euxine &s;ea, after he had made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the Palus Moeotis.</P>
<P>Peter's reformation de&s;cended even to the dre&s;s of his &s;ubjects. In&s;tead of the conical caps lined with fur, the long beards and gowns, which they wore in imitation of the A&s;iatics, he obliged them to &s;have their beards, and wear their garments in the European fa&s;hion. This reformation he began and carried on with circum&s;tances of good humour and ridicule, which proved much more palatable and effectual than an arbitrary command. He fir&s;t of all per&s;uaded the boyars or grandees, and military officers, to imitate his own example in wearing cloaths made in the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion: then he cau&s;ed a &s;uit, in the &s;ame mode, to be hung up as a pattern at every gate of the city, and publi&s;hed an edict, that every per&s;on pa&s;&s;ing through the&s;e gates with long garments, &s;hould either pay a &s;e|vere fine, or allow their coats to be curtailed on
<PB N="328" REF="3410">
the &s;pot: an operation which was often performed, and occa&s;ioned abundance of mirth. He more|over in&s;tituted ma&s;querades and mock proce&s;&s;ions, in which the courtiers of both &s;exes appeared in the ancient garb, decked out with ludicrous exag|gerations and extravagancies, which &s;oon brought it into contempt. It was not, however, without the utmo&s;t reluctance that the Ru&s;&s;ians re&s;igned their beards, for which they entertained a religious kind of veneration.</P>
<P>The Ru&s;&s;ian aera u&s;ed to be the creation of the world, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to have been fifteen hundred years more early than it is fixed by other nations: they likewi&s;e began the year with Sep|tember, alledging, it was more probable that God created the earth in autumn, when it was &s;tored with fruits in full maturity, than in March, when it was covered with &s;now. The Czar, however, compelled them to adopt the Roman calculation, tho' this was not introduced without great difficulty; for his people were very tenacious of their antient cu&s;toms.</P>
<P>This celebrated hero and legi&s;lator, who a&s;&s;umed the title of Imperial Maje&s;ty, and ju&s;tly acquired the appellation of Peter the Great, died at Peter&s;burgh in the year 1725, leaving the crown to his empre&s;s Catherine, who had been the widow of a &s;erjeant.</P>
<P>The &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the throne of Ru&s;&s;ia has been always counted lineal; though the next heir of blood has been often &s;et a&s;ide by the arbitrary will of the Czar, the intrigues of the nobles, or the rebellions of the people.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>The only natural curio&s;ity in this empire, which de&s;erves particular notice, is the boranets, or plant, re&s;embling a lamb, that grows in the neighbour|hood of A&s;tracan, Ca&s;an, Samara, and in &s;ome other provinces. This vegetable is covered with
<PB N="329" REF="3420">
a &s;kin that bears white curled wool, which &s;kin the natives dre&s;s like tanned leather, and u&s;e it for lining to wai&s;tcoats. The bears and hares, and other animals that grow white in the winter, are generally numbered among the rarities of Ru&s;&s;ia; but they are not peculiar to this empire. We might likewi&s;e take notice of the va&s;t lakes, and the enormous &s;ize of the pike, trout, &s;turgeon, and belluga, which they contain: but curio&s;ities of this nature have been already de&s;cribed in our accounts of other countries.</P>
<P>Among the rarities of art, we reckon the cathe|dral at Mo&s;cow, the great bell, the city of Peter&s;|burgh, the canal between the Wolga and the Don, the communication by water from Peter&s;burg to Mo&s;cow, and the great road between the&s;e cities, projected and partly fini&s;hed by Peter, running, for a tract of four hundred and eighty-&s;even miles, through fore&s;ts and mora&s;&s;es, over hills and moun|tains, being a &s;urpri&s;ing cau&s;eway of timber. But, perhaps, the greate&s;t curio&s;ity that Mu&s;covy ever produced was the character of the Czar, in all re|&s;pects the object of our admiration.</P>

<HEAD>POLITICAL INTERESTS.</HEAD>
<P>The late empre&s;s (Elizabeth) of Ru&s;&s;ia, com|mi&s;erating the &s;tate of her &s;i&s;ter empre&s;s queen of Hungary, and &s;educed by French promi&s;es and politics, joined with the hou&s;es of Au&s;tria and Bourbon again&s;t Great Britain and Pru&s;&s;ia. Her arms undoubtedly turned the &s;cale of war again&s;t his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty; and unle&s;s her death had not happened &s;o critically as it did, it is hard to &s;ay what might have been the event.</P>
<P>Her &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the late emperor Peter the Third, broke off the unnatural alliance, and notwith|&s;tanding his unhappy fate, which was partly owing to his connections with Pru&s;&s;ia, his plan of conduct

has &s;ince been adopted and improved by his wife, the pre&s;ent empre&s;s. She has particularly attached her&s;elf to the friend&s;hip of Great Britain, as the only means of &s;upplying the deficiency of her finances by cultivating the commerce of her dominions, which mu&s;t be always &s;afe, when protected by the Briti&s;h marine. She has laid out many great plans for the civilization, as well as aggrandizement of her empire; but though &s;he is naturally magnifi|cent, &s;he is obliged to be frugal, in order to put them into execution. Though &s;he is at a con&s;iderable expence upon her navy, and though perhaps it is &s;uperior to that either of Denmark or Sweden, yet the genius of her people does not &s;eem to incline towards maritime affairs; for it has been ob&s;erved that &s;he has many &s;ailors, but few &s;eamen. She acts a capital part in the pre&s;ent di&s;tractions of Poland, the crown of which &s;he not only be&s;towed upon its pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, but &s;till keeps it on his head, in which it is thought &s;he will be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by his Pru&s;&s;ian maje&s;ty. Upon the whole, as to her political inter|e&s;ts, &s;he has nothing to dread but from Great Britain.</P>
<P>The trade carried on between Mo&s;cow and China is of very little con&s;equence to Ru&s;&s;ia, con&s;idering the va&s;t length of land-carriage, the great expence and &s;low return, the nature of the commodities imported, and the danger to which the caravans are expo&s;ed from rivers, &s;ands, de&s;erts, and Tartarean robbers. A commerce &s;ettled with Per&s;ia over the Ca&s;pian &s;ea, from A&s;tracan and Derbent, would be much more ea&s;y, &s;afe, expeditious, and profitable.</P>
<P>Hitherto we have only &s;poken of the Ru&s;&s;ians in general, without particularizing the different na|tions and tribes that inhabit this va&s;t empire, ex|cept tho&s;e of the country of Livonia, which we have de&s;cribed in the article of SWEDEN, and the inhabitants of Mu&s;covite Lapland, who are the &s;ame people of whom we have treated in our ac|count of SWEDISH LAPLAND.

<P>We&s;tern Mu&s;covy is comprehended in the two and twenty provinces of Ple&s;kow, or P&s;kow, Great Novogorod Veleki, Twere, Rzeva, or Re&s;chow, Biela, or Biel&s;ki, Smolen&s;ko, Severia, Czernichow, Vorotin, Rezan, Bielgorod, Mordoa, Ni&s;i-novogo|rod, Volodimer, Su&s;dal, Mo&s;cow, Ro&s;tow, Yero|&s;lawla, Bileje&s;ora, or Belozero, Vologda, Cargapol, and Dwina.</P>
<P>Ple&s;kow, or P&s;kow, formerly a republic, and afterwards a dutchy, lies between Novogorod on the ea&s;t, Ingria and E&s;tonia on the north, Livonia on the we&s;t, and the palatinate of Polockz on the &s;outh. In the &s;ixteenth century it was &s;ubdued by Iwan Ba&s;ilowitz. The country is tolerably fertile, and remarkable for the lake of Ple&s;kow, which empties it&s;elf into that of Peibus. The capital, of the &s;ame name, &s;eated on the mouth of the river Muldaw, is a metropolitan &s;ee, populous, and con|&s;iderable, divided into four quarters, each &s;ur|rounded with its own walls, and the whole &s;ecured by a &s;trong ca&s;tle, &s;ituated on a high rock, almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. The other principal towns of this di&s;trict are Abdova, Petzar, O&s;trova, Fieburgh, Voronecks, and Po&s;tarzova. There is nothing re|markable in the&s;e and &s;ome other paultry places of this lord&s;hip, except the fortifications, which are kept in repair for the &s;ecurity of the frontier.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Novogorod Veleki, lying to the ea&s;tward of Ple&s;kow, is divided into five di&s;tricts, watered by four lakes and &s;ixteen rivers. In the &s;outhern part we meet with the famous lake Ilmen, i&s;&s;uing in the river Wolohawa, which runs through part of this province into the lake Ladoga. The country of Novogorod Veleki, extending about one hundred and fifty miles in length, produces corn,
<PB N="332" REF="3450">
hemp, flax, leather, honey, and wax; and former|ly, when governed by its own princes, drove a con|&s;iderable trade in the&s;e commodities; but, in con|&s;equence of its &s;ubjection to the Czar, its commerce has greatly decayed. Novogorod, the capital, called by the French Neugard, and by the Dutch Newgarten, is a large, populous, and well forti|fied city, &s;tanding on the banks of the Wolohawa: the hou&s;es, however, are mean, and all built of wood and timber, and the walls are compo&s;ed of the &s;ame materials. From the ruins of towers, &s;teeples, and old walls, without the circuit of the pre&s;ent city, it appears that the place was once much more magnificent and exten&s;ive. <Q>Such was the flouri&s;hing condition of Novogorod, that it be|came proverbial to &s;ay, &startq;Who can hurt God and Novogorod?&endq;</Q> But the city &s;u&s;tained many rude &s;hocks from the arms of the Poles, Ru&s;&s;ians, and other nations. John Ba&s;ilicus Grot&s;den, tyrant of Mu&s;covy, made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of Novogorod in the year 1477: he afterwards went thither in per&s;on, and pillaged the city, from whence he car|ried to Mo&s;cow many hundred waggons loaded with gold, &s;ilver, precious &s;tones, rich &s;tuffs, and other valuable moveables: he likewi&s;e removed the principal inhabitants to Mo&s;cow, and peopled No|vogorod with Ru&s;&s;ians. Since it became &s;ubject to the czar of Mu&s;covy, its trade and &s;plendour have been greatly dimini&s;hed. It is, however, the &s;eat of an archbi&s;hop, and &s;till carries on a tolerable &s;hare of commerce. The cathedral, called St. Sophia, is a &s;pacious beautiful Gothic edifice: the ca&s;tle, or citadel, on the other &s;ide of the river, is joined to the city by a long bridge; over which many thou&s;ands of the citizens, including a great number of eccle&s;ia&s;tics, were precipitated into the Wolohawa by command of the tyrant Iwan Ba&s;i|lowitz, on the bare &s;u&s;picion of an intended revolt.

He pillaged all the churches, and the archbi&s;hop's palace: he ordered the me|tropolitan to be &s;et upon a white hor&s;e, with his legs fettered, a cymbal hanging about his neck, and a flagelet in his hand. In this equipage he was conducted to Mo&s;cow, and e&s;caped with this affront in lieu of puni&s;hment: but all the abbots and monks were either put to the &s;word, or drowned in the river. At pre&s;ent the vaivode re|&s;ides in the ca&s;tle, in the neighbourhood of which appear the archiepi&s;copal palace, and a mona&s;tery dedicated to St. Anthony of Padua. Here like|wi&s;e is another convent, &s;aid to have been built on the ruins of an antient temple, dedicated to Perun, the God of Fire, heretofore wor&s;hipped in this place under the figure of a Deity weilding a thun|derbolt. There are be&s;ides about an hundred churches, and &s;eventy mona&s;teries, in Novogorod; the roofs and &s;pires of which are covered with gilt copper, &s;o as to exhibit a very dazzling appear|ance. Novogorod &s;tands about one hundred miles to the &s;outhward of Peter&s;burg, and above two hundred to the north-we&s;t of Mo&s;cow. In a word, Novogorod was once the emporeum of the north, frequented by merchants from all the different parts of Europe. At pre&s;ent it is much dimini&s;hed both in people and extent, and may be about two leagues in circumference.</P>
<P>The other towns of this di&s;trict are Staraia, Stara Ru&s;&s;a, or Old Ru&s;&s;ia, &s;tanding on the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore of the lake Ilmen, who&s;e outlet is the river Lovat, from the water of which the inha|bitants make a con&s;iderable quantity of &s;alt for ex|portation; New Ru&s;&s;a, &s;ituated on the &s;ame river;

<P>Twere is a &s;mall dutchy, but fertile and popu|lous, taking its name from the river Twezza, by which it is watered. It lies to the &s;outhward and ea&s;tward of Great Novogorod; is bounded on the ea&s;t by the dutchy of Ro&s;tow, on the &s;outh by Mo&s;cow, and the province of Rzeva. This dutchy was once able to furni&s;h forty thou&s;and hor&s;emen armed, and the like number of infantry, for the &s;ervice of the Czar. The capital, Twere, &s;tands on the confluence of the Twezza and Wolga, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground, about twenty-five leagues to the north-we&s;t of Mo&s;cow, is large, rich, and populous; an epi&s;copal &s;ee, adorned with above three&s;core &s;tately churches, and provided with a mint for the coinage of money. Upon the &s;ame river, and about twenty miles to the northward of Twere, we meet with Ter&s;ack, Tor&s;ak, or Tar&s;ack, a populous place of con&s;i|derable extent. The other towns are known by the names of Wolkofkoi, Starica, Preze&s;ta, Ole&s;ch|na Co&s;&s;ia, Sattrite, Geroden al Gorodna, Clin, Mac|grova, Czornaia Sloboda, and Mitre.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Rzeva, or Re&s;chow, lies to the &s;outhward of Twere and of Mo&s;cow, and to the northward of Biela and the principality of Vitep&s;k. The former capital, now called Rzeva the De&s;ert, &s;tood on the we&s;tern &s;ide of the province; but is now abandoned in favour of Rzeva Volodemer&s;ki, agreeably &s;ituated on the Wolga, at a &s;mall di&s;|tance from the lake of this name, which is one of
<PB N="335" REF="3480">
the &s;ources of the river. The hou&s;es are mean; but the place is well peopled, and carries on &s;ome commerce in hemp, flax, and fi&s;h. It &s;tands on the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the province, about eighteen leagues to the we&s;tward of Mo&s;cow. Toropeckz is a &s;mall neat town, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on a little river that falls into the Dwina. The other towns of this di&s;trict are Veliki-Loaki, Borgocove, Bo|roveo, Zari, Lubiekze, and Dudure, places of very little note or con&s;equence.</P>
<P>The principality of Biela, or Biel&s;ki, lies to the &s;outhward and we&s;tward of Rzeva, to the ea&s;tward of Lithuania and the palatinate of Witepetz, and to the northward of Smolen&s;ko. It was formerly a dukedom, governed by its own princes, though &s;ubject to Lithuania. The capital, Biela, &s;ituated on the river O&s;ca, which falls into the Dwina, was a con&s;iderable town, until &s;ubdued by the czar Ba&s;ilowitz; but now it is decayed and contemptible in all re&s;pects.</P>
<P>The province of Smolen&s;ko, extending about two hundred miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is commonly &s;tiled the Great Dutchy, or Palatinate. It is bounded on the north by the principality of Biela, on the &s;outh by the dutchy of Severia, on the ea&s;t by Mo&s;cow, and on the we&s;t by Lithuania, to which it was formerly &s;ubject; but it hath &s;hifted ma&s;ters, and been alternately &s;ubdued by the Poles and the Mu&s;covites, until it was finally yielded to the Czar by treaty about the latter end of the la&s;t century. The ground of this province, though watered by the Nieper, or Bori&s;thenes, which ri&s;es on the north-ea&s;t border, is generally barren; but it abounds with wild bea&s;ts, and their &s;kins yield a good profit. The capital, Smolen&s;ko, agreeably &s;eated on the banks of the Nieper, near the con|fines of Lithuania, is a large, populous, and well fortified city, containing about eight thou&s;and
<PB N="336" REF="3490">
hou&s;es, generally well built, and &s;urrounded with woods, which produce the be&s;t firs in all Mu&s;co|vy. It &s;tands two hundred and ten miles to the we&s;tward of Mo&s;cow, was formerly a metropolitan, but now is a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, and is &s;ecured with a &s;trong citadel and numerous garri&s;on Dragobu&s;a is the next town of any con&s;equence, &s;ituated on the &s;ame river, fifteen miles above Smolen&s;ko.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Severia, or Sever&s;ki, lies to the &s;outhward of Smolen&s;ko, to the ea&s;tward of Czer|nikow, to the northward of Bielgorod, and to the we&s;tward of Little Ru&s;&s;ia. It was formerly po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by princes de&s;cended of Demetrius, &s;ur|named the Great; but was wre&s;ted from that hou&s;e by the czar Ba&s;ilowitz. It afterwards fell into the hands of Sigi&s;mund III. king of Poland, who in|corporated it with his dominions; but was again re&s;tored to Mu&s;covy. The province is watered by the rivers Ubick, Dzwina, and Nevin; is fertile and populous, though great part of it is covered with woods. In the &s;outhern part of it is a fore&s;t, computed to extend an hundred miles &s;quare. The chief town is known by the different appellations of Novogrodeck, Novogorod, and Novogorod-Siwer&s;ki, or Seef&s;ki. It &s;tands on the river Do|niza, and is well fortified, according to the Ru&s;&s;ian manner. Bran&s;ki, or Bran&s;zo, is another &s;mall, neat, and &s;trong town, &s;ituated on the river Dez|na. Demetriowick &s;tands on the river Ugra, which was once the boundary between Mu&s;covy and Lithuania: it is a place of &s;mall import. Such al&s;o are Pock&s;op, Rodohop, Starazangra, Neun, Ser&s;pkoi-Gorodoc, Starodub, Seren&s;k, Carakzef, Sie&s;k, Krupuc, and Putiol.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Czernichow, or Czernikow, is bounded on the north and ea&s;t by Severia and part of Lithuania, and on the we&s;t and &s;outh by the Nieper and palatinate of Kiow. It extends about
<PB N="337" REF="3500">
one hundred and twenty miles in length, and, though watered by the river Dezna, the land is barren and unprofitable. Be&s;ides the chief town, called Czernichow, which is neither large nor con|&s;iderable, there are &s;everal paultry places, &s;uch as Omby, Perecop, Vibbi, So&s;nica, Kwale&s;in, and Pu&s;ia.</P>
<P>The principality of Vorotin, or Vorotin&s;ki, is bounded on the north by the river Ugra and part of Rhezan; on the &s;outh by the Le&s;&s;er Tartary, or the land of the Co&s;&s;acks, to who&s;e incur&s;ions it lies &s;o much expo&s;ed, that this part of it is almo&s;t de&s;olate, though on the other &s;ide it is fertile and populous, being watered by the river Occa. On the banks of this river is &s;ituated the capital, Vo|rotin, a &s;mall town, &s;ecured by a ca&s;tle, and other fortifications. Bolgoff, Starol, and Cromarc, are &s;trong places, &s;tanding on the &s;ame river.</P>
<P>The province of Rhezan comprehends a large tract of land, lying between the Don and the Occa, extending near an hundred leagues, and counted by the Ru&s;&s;ians the mo&s;t fertile &s;oil in the whole world. According to the&s;e, the corn grows &s;o thick and &s;o &s;trong, that a hor&s;e can hardly make his way through the &s;talks. Great plenty and va|riety of fruits are likewi&s;e produced in this pro|vince. The people are &s;aid to be warlike, civi|lized, and &s;o numerous, that they can, without dif|ficulty, rai&s;e an army of &s;ixty thou&s;and men, hor&s;e and infantry, in due proportion. The dutchy is watered by the river Don, or Tanais, which takes its ri&s;e within the province, and is increa&s;ed by &s;everal &s;treams, which yield plenty of delicious fi&s;h. This country was governed by its own dukes, un|til &s;ubdued by the czar of Mu&s;covy. Rezan, the antient capital, was formerly a large and populous city, advantageou&s;ly &s;eated on the Occa. This place made a noble re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the Tartars,
<PB N="338" REF="3510">
by which the whole empire was pre&s;erved from ruin, though they at length de&s;troyed the city, and ravaged the whole province. The archiepi&s;copal &s;ee is all that now remains of the grandeur of the antient Rezan. The di&s;per&s;ed inhabitants, a&s;&s;em|bling together, conveyed the materials of the ruined city to the di&s;tance of about eight leagues, and, in conjunction with a great number of people from Pere&s;ta, built the new town of Pere&s;ta Re|zan&s;ki. But the mo&s;t con&s;iderable town of this dutchy is Voronitz, or Woronitz, commonly called Veronis, &s;ituated on a &s;mall river of the &s;ame name, which falls into the Don, or Tanais. It was here that Peter the Great cau&s;ed a &s;quadron of &s;hips of war to be built, and hence they were conveyed by the Don into the Black Sea. The town &s;tands on a hill, &s;urrounded with a decayed wooden wall, and is divided into three parts; in one of which, called Jakatoff, the Ru&s;&s;ian merchants commonly re&s;ide. Without the walls there are exten&s;ive rope|walks, and a large &s;ubterranean powder-magazine. The declivity of the hill, and the &s;ide of the river, are adorned with magnificent hou&s;es, belonging to the Ru&s;&s;ian admirals and per&s;ons of di&s;tinction. The greater part of the&s;e face the citadel, which is joined to the town by a large bridge of communi|cation. Behind tho&s;e hou&s;es are &s;treets, inhabited by the people employed in &s;hip-building. The town, which &s;tands about &s;ixty-eight leagues to the &s;outhward of Mo&s;cow, is beautified with &s;everal hand&s;ome churches, and contains about ten thou|&s;and &s;ouls. The citadel is a large quadrangular fort, flanked with four towers, in&s;tead of ba&s;tions, &s;urrounded by a va&s;t fo&s;&s;e and &s;trong palli&s;adoes, and defended by a numerous garri&s;on. It is fur|ni&s;hed with large and numerous apartments for the u&s;e of the officers, as well as with warehou&s;es, in which were contained great quantities of naval
<PB N="339" REF="3520">
&s;tores. This, indeed, is the chief magazine for this part of Ru&s;&s;ia, in which about one hundred and fifty pieces of cannon are kept unmounted, for the more &s;peedy carriage. In the neighbour|hood of the town is a remarkable mountain, cracked in many different places, and almo&s;t moul|dered away. Here we &s;ee remains of many antient monuments, and abundance of human bones are &s;cattered on the top, and about the &s;ides of the mountain. Donkarod is a large town, &s;ituated about fourteen leagues to the &s;outhward of Rezan, near the &s;ources of the Tanais and the Tula, de|fended by a &s;trong ca&s;tle, built by order of the czar Ba&s;ilowitz. The other towns of this province are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of Toul, Czarpa|cof, Cochira, Michailof, Grematzeff, Pere&s;lanli-Re&s;an&s;ki, Tmer&s;caia, Slobada, Prone&s;k, Rae&s;col, Tamboff, Co&s;toff, Donco, Lebedan, Talecz, Voro|necks, Sercot, Bagat&s;i Satoon, Tzernaca, Ozeri|&s;taia, Pran&s;i, Epifan, Veret&s;a, Toula, Caprivora, and Baela.</P>
<P>The province of Bielgorod, formerly known by the name of Organia, lies to the &s;outhward of Re|zan, and to the northward of Nogay and the Don Co&s;&s;acks: on the ea&s;t it is bounded by the river Don, and on the we&s;t by the Ukraine and palati|nate of Kiow. Being watered by &s;everal &s;treams, and lying under a mild climate, the &s;oil is naturally fertile; but being expo&s;ed to the continual inroads of the Don Co&s;&s;acks, it is neither populous nor well cultivated. This country formerly belonged to the&s;e Tartars, from whom it was conquered by the Mu&s;covites: but the inhabitants &s;till retain the cu&s;toms and manners of the Tartarians, chu&s;ing rather to &s;ub&s;i&s;t by free-booting than by cultivating the lands, and living &s;ociably in towns or cities. Of the&s;e la&s;t there is none but the capital, Biel|gorod, which is a place of very little con&s;ideration.
<PB N="340" REF="3530">
The &s;maller towns, of which there is a good num|ber, are either half ruined, or totally abandoned.</P>
<P>To the northward of Le&s;&s;er Tartary and Rezan, and to the ea&s;tward of Mo&s;cow, Volodomir, and Ni&s;inovogorod, lies the province of Mordoa, bounded on the north by the river Wolga. The country is tolerably well cultivated, abounding with fore&s;ts; and the inhabitants are &s;aid to be the mo&s;t civilized of all Tartarian Mu&s;covy. The chief towns are Adema and Mortima: the people wor&s;hip one good and one evil principle; the fir&s;t through love, the other from apprehen|&s;ion; but they have neither prie&s;ts nor temples.</P>
<P>The province of Czeremi&s;&s;e, lying to the ea&s;t|ward of Mordoa, is a va&s;t tract of land, extending to the length of three hundred miles, and divided by the river Wolga, into the &s;outhern and northern di&s;tricts: the fir&s;t, adjoining to Mordva, is called Nagornoi, &s;ignifying mountainous: the &s;outhern is known by the name of Logowai, or Low Land. Here great herds of cattle are bred by the inha|bitants, who are counted the mo&s;t &s;avage of all the Tartars. They are faithle&s;s, cruel, and &s;uper&s;ti|tious: they have no towns; but live in wretched huts, &s;ub&s;i&s;ting on wild honey, the milk of their cattle, and the game they kill in their fore&s;ts. The&s;e people, in general, are ignorant alike of Chri&s;tianity and Mahometani&s;m, though &s;ome of them are &s;aid to be Mu&s;&s;elmans. They have no idea of a future &s;tate; but believe they are rewarded or puni&s;hed in this, according to their merit or demerit, by the good and evil &s;pirit. They repair to a mar&s;hy &s;pot, about forty leagues from Cazan, to pay their devotions in the open fields, and carry offerings to the evil &s;pirit, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;ide near the brook Shock&s;heim, which never freezes in the colde&s;t weather: this phaenomenon they impute to the power of that &s;pirit, and will
<PB N="341" REF="3540">
not venture to approach the rivulet, though they often &s;ee it cro&s;&s;ed by the Mu&s;covites. To the &s;upreme Being they &s;acrifice an hor&s;e, an ox, or a ram, roa&s;ted and ba&s;ted with a preparation of honey. They likewi&s;e pay adoration to the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, and even wor&s;hip living crea|tures. Their language is peculiar to them&s;elves, and not under&s;tood either by Mu&s;covites or Tar|tars. They indulge them&s;elves in polygamy, and live in a very brutal manner. The dre&s;s of their women con&s;i&s;ts of a long coar&s;e linnen gown, with a &s;ort of head-dre&s;s ri&s;ing up in the &s;hape of an horn, at the top of which a little bell is &s;u&s;pended by a &s;ilken &s;tring of various colours. The men wear nearly the &s;ame &s;ort of garment, with drawers under it: tho&s;e that are married &s;have their heads; for batchelors let their hair grow to a con&s;iderable length. This nation is &s;ubject to the Czar, in who&s;e armies they are obliged to &s;erve, when re|quired; but they pay no tribute, except a &s;mall voluntary contribution.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Ni&s;i-novogorod, lying to the we&s;tward of Ca&s;an, and to the ea&s;tward of Mo&s;cow and Wolodimer, is a large tract of fruitful ground, watered by the Wolga and the Occa, abounding with fore&s;ts, yet plea&s;ant and populous. The ca|pital, Ni&s;i-novogorod, Ni&s;en, or Ni&s;en-newgarten, is &s;ituated on a rock at the confluence of the Wol|ga and the Occa, &s;urrounded by a wall of &s;tone, and defended by a &s;trong citadel. Without the &s;tately gate called Iwanof&s;ki, near the river|&s;ide, we meet with a &s;pacious bazar, or market, through which we pa&s;s into the town: within the gate we enter a noble &s;treet, that runs by a gentle a&s;cent through the whole length of the town to the oppo&s;ite gate Diawetro&s;ki, and is inter&s;ected by a good number of wooden bridges. The ca|thedral is a &s;tately edifice, with five cupolas, built
<PB N="342" REF="3550">
after the model of Santa Sophia at Con&s;tantinople. Every cupola is painted with a green varni&s;h, and adorned on the top with little elegant cro&s;&s;es. Hard by this cathedral &s;tands the archiepi&s;copal palace, a magnificent &s;tone-building, including a church and &s;pire within its walls. The chancery, the governor's palace, and other hou&s;es of note, are large and commodious, but generally built of timber. The city it&s;elf is &s;mall; but the &s;uburbs, e&s;pecially tho&s;e on the river-&s;ide, are large and populous containing &s;everal churches. The towers that flank the city-walls, the high hill adorned with &s;tructures of different kinds, the river covered with barges and trading ve&s;&s;els, concur to form a delightful pro&s;pect. What renders the place the more agreeable, there is plenty of good provi&s;ion, extremely cheap. Four fla&s;ks of wine are here &s;old for twenty pence: a fat lamb may be bought for fourteen pence, two ducks for one penny, and every other article in the &s;ame proportion. The city is inhabited by Ru&s;&s;ians, who avail them&s;elves of this plenty, to eat and drink to the mo&s;t bea&s;tly exce&s;s. On holidays both men and women may be &s;een carou&s;ing at tables in the open &s;treets, and great numbers of them lying drunk and a&s;leep in different parts of the city; which &s;tands about five and thirty miles to the ea&s;tward of Mo&s;cow, though the cour&s;e by water extends to an hundred. The confluence of the Wolga and the Occa, at this place, forms a body of water about four thou&s;and feet in breadth.</P>
<P>Ba&s;iligorod, or Wa&s;iligorod, is a large village, built of wood, on the right &s;hore of the river Wolga, at the foot of a ri&s;ing ground. It was founded and fortified by the czar Ba&s;ilius, as a check upon the Tartars; but, &s;ince the territories of Ru&s;&s;ia have been enlarged on that &s;ide, the for|tifications being no longer u&s;eful, were &s;uffered to
<PB N="343" REF="3560">
fall into decay. The other towns of this province are Slaboda, Pa&s;toff, and Balagna, places of no note or importance.</P>
<P>The province of Wolodimer is bounded by the river Wolga on the north, by Ni&s;i-novogorod on the ea&s;t, by Mo&s;cow on the &s;outh, and on the we&s;t by the dutchies of Su&s;dal and Ro&s;tow. The coun|try is full of fens and fore&s;ts, watered by the rivers Cle&s;ma, Wolga, and Occa, on each &s;ide of which rivers the flats are exceedingly fertile. The ca|pital, Wolodimer, &s;tands about five and twenty leagues to the north-ea&s;t of Mo&s;cow, on the face of a high hill, inter&s;ected with vallies. The na|ture of its &s;ituation, with its white churches, lofty &s;pires, and the cour&s;e of the river Cle&s;ma-recca, which winds along the foot of the hill, exhibit a very noble appearance: but within there is nothing an&s;werable to this external magnificence. It was built by prince Wolodimer in the beginning of the tenth century; and here he and his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors re|&s;ided, until the court was removed to Mo&s;cow. Since that period the grandeur of Wolodimer has been gradually decaying. Many &s;tately hou&s;es, and great part of the fortifications, are now in ruins: neverthele&s;s the place is &s;till con&s;iderable and populous, contains a good number of churches, &s;even or eight built of &s;tone, and the adjacent ter|ritory is remarkably fruitful. Be&s;ides Wolodimer, we reckon the towns of Sle&s;s, Gorachowitz, and Baluchna: the fir&s;t &s;ituated on the Cle&s;ma; the two la&s;t on the Wolga.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Su&s;dal, bounded on the north by the Wolga, and on the &s;outh by Wolodimer, extends about forty-five leagues from ea&s;t to we&s;t, is watered by &s;everal rivers, that fertilize the low grounds; and great part of it is covered with large fore&s;ts, &s;tocked with fallow deer, and other game, as well as with wild bea&s;ts, who&s;e furs are valuable.
<PB N="344" REF="3570">
This whole country was &s;ubdued by John Ba&s;ilo|witz. Su&s;dal, the capital, is &s;ituated on the river Cle&s;ma, about twenty leagues north north-ea&s;t from Mo&s;cow, was formerly the metropolis of Ru&s;|&s;ia, and is &s;till the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop. The town is chiefly built of wood, in the Ru&s;&s;ian man|ner, and retains very little of its former magni|ficence, except a &s;tately mona&s;tery of nuns, and &s;ome few antient edifices.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Mo&s;cow is the chief province of this great empire, deriving its name from the river Mu&s;cova, or Mo&s;ka, on which the capital is &s;ituated. It was from this dutchy that the Czars of old took the title of Dukes of Mu&s;covy. The province is bounded on the north by the dutchies of Twere, Ro&s;tow, Su&s;dal, and Wolodimer; on the &s;outh by Rezan, from which it is &s;eparated by the river Occa; on the ea&s;t by the principality of Cachine, and the &s;ame river Occa parting it from Ni&s;i-novo|gorod; and on the we&s;t by the dutchies of Rzeva, Biela, and Smolen&s;ko. It extends about two hun|dred miles in length, and about one hundred in breadth; and is watered by the Mo&s;ka, Occa, and Cle&s;ma, which fall into the Wolga: neverthele&s;s the &s;oil is not very fertile. The air, however, tho' &s;harp, is &s;alubrious; and this con&s;ideration, with the advantage of its being &s;ituated in the mid&s;t of the be&s;t provinces in the empire, induced the Czars to make it their chief re&s;idence. In the we&s;tern part of Mo&s;cow is a large fore&s;t, from whence flows the celebrated river Nieper, or Bory&s;thenes, which, traver&s;ing the dutchy of Smolen&s;ko, winds in a &s;er|pentine cour&s;e to Ukrania, Lithuania, and Poland. The capital, Mo&s;cow, or Mo&s;kova, is the metro|polis and large&s;t city of the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, &s;ituated in a &s;pacious plain on the banks of the river Mu&s;|kova; over which the prince Gafi&s;chin built a &s;tately bridge, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve arches of pro|digious
<PB N="345" REF="3580">
heighth, breadth, and &s;olidity; becau&s;e the river is &s;o apt to overflow its banks: it was de|&s;igned by a Poli&s;h monk, and is the only &s;tone|bridge in all Ru&s;&s;ia. Mo&s;cow is &s;eated on a whol-&s;ome gravelly &s;oil, and divided into four quarters, each &s;urrounded with a di&s;tinct wall. The&s;e di&s;|tricts are known by the names of Cataigorod, Cza|rogorod, Skorodum, and Strelitze-&s;laboda. The Cataigorod, &s;urrounded with a brick-wall, is the middle of the city; in which &s;tands the citadel, about two miles in circuit, fortified with a triple wall, flanked with towers, and a fo&s;&s;e. It contains two imperial palaces, the one of timber, and the other of &s;tone, built after the Italian architecture; the patriarchal palace, which is a large antient edi|fice; the exchequer, chancery, and other offices; two noble mona&s;teries; five large churches, in|cluding that of St. Michael, famous for its fabrick and ornaments, as well as for the monuments of the Grand Dukes and Czars, who have been here interred; the grand magazine, and many other &s;tately buildings. Without the citadel-gate &s;tands that noble edifice the church of Jeru&s;alem, fini&s;hed by the czar John Ba&s;ilides, who ordered the archi|tect to be deprived of his eye-&s;ight, that he might never contrive, or at lea&s;t behold its equal. In the great market that fronts the citadel we &s;ee the &s;tupendous bell, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the large&s;t in the whole world. It was hung in a tower built for the purpo&s;e, which tower was con&s;umed by fire in the beginning of the pre&s;ent century. The weight of the bell amounts to three hundred and thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and pounds. It is in heighth nineteen feet, in diameter twenty-three, in circumference &s;eventy, and the &s;ides are two feet in thickne&s;s. One hun|dred men were employed in moving this mon&s;trous machine, which was only rung on extraordinary occa&s;ions: for example, when the Czar conde&s;|cended
<PB N="346" REF="3590">
to &s;hew him&s;elf to his people, and when he conver&s;ed with his wife, that the &s;ubjects might know when to petition heaven that a male child &s;hould be the i&s;&s;ue of the conjugal embrace. This di&s;trict is watered by the rivers Negliga and Mo&s;ka, and is called Cataigorod from <HI>Catai,</HI> the Ru&s;&s;ian name for China, becau&s;e here the merchandizes of that empire are chiefly &s;old. The Czarogorod, or ducal city, encompa&s;&s;es the Cataigorod, and is it&s;elf fortified with a white &s;tone-wall, called Biela|&s;tena, whence it has acquired the appellation of Bielagorod, or the White City. The mo&s;t remark|able building in this divi&s;ion is the great ar&s;enal. The Skorodum Quarter &s;tands to the north-we&s;t of the Czarogorod, and is chiefly inhabited by timber-merchants and carpenters, who &s;ell wooden hou&s;es ready made. It is &s;urrounded with a mud|wall, and di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Scorodum, which &s;ignifies <HI>done in ha&s;te,</HI> becau&s;e, on an alarm from the Tartars, it was fini&s;hed in four days, though it is fifteen miles in circuit, and the earth is every where &s;upported by planks and beams of timber. It is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be &s;uch a magazine of hou&s;es ready made, to &s;up|ply the lo&s;s of tho&s;e that peri&s;h almo&s;t every day by conflagrations, owing to the carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, rage, and intoxication of the inhabitants. On the ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;ides of the Cataigorod and citadel &s;tands the Strelitze-&s;laboda, &s;o called from the guards of that name, who were formerly lodged in this quarter, which is fortified with wooden ramparts, and divided from the other parts of the city by the river Mo&s;ka. The hou&s;es of the com|monalty are no better than mean paultry wooden huts, without neatne&s;s and furniture: but the merchants &s;ecure their commodities in vaults of &s;tone or brick, which are proof again&s;t the acci|dents of fire. There are three thou&s;and &s;tone or
<PB N="347" REF="3600">
brick hou&s;es in the city of Mo&s;cow; but they &s;tand at &s;uch di&s;tances from one another, are &s;o in|termingled with rows of wooden hou&s;es, and &s;uch a number of them &s;tand detached from, and, as it were, behind the &s;treet, &s;urrounded with high walls, that the effect of them is almo&s;t lo&s;t in the general pro&s;pect. The &s;treets, in&s;tead of being paved with &s;tones, are boarded with fir-planks; &s;o that in conflagrations the ground &s;eems to burn, and it becomes impo&s;&s;ible to approach the &s;cene of di&s;a&s;ter. Among the churches and chapels of this city, which are &s;aid to amount in number to fif|teen hundred, that in the Krimelin, or palace of the citadel, is a very antient and remarkable edi|fice. On the right-hand &s;ide of the altar is the Czar's throne, and on the left is that of the patri|arch. The body of the church is lighted by a &s;ilver chandelier of immen&s;e weight and value. The jewels and ornaments belonging to an image of the Virgin Mary, are valued at half a tun weight in gold: but ine&s;timable is the value of an infinite number of chalices, pixes, patens, &s;tatues, and other church-uten&s;ils of gold and &s;ilver, curiou&s;ly wrought and enriched with precious &s;tones, a pro|digious number of rich prie&s;tly ve&s;tments, be&s;ides innumerable donatives, and pre&s;ents offered to the reliques of three eminent Ru&s;&s;ian &s;aints interred in this place. In a word, the trea&s;ure contained in this church is &s;aid to equal, at lea&s;t, that of any cathedral in Europe. Hard by the church of St. Michael, which we have mentioned above, is the &s;tately abbey of nuns, called Tzudoff-mona&s;ter: here the bodies of the prince&s;&s;es of the blood are interred; and in a &s;eparate chapel we &s;ee the tombs of tho&s;e princes who never a&s;cended the throne. Nothing can be more rich and magnifi|cent than the palls with which their coffins are co|vered on holidays. Of the &s;everal mona&s;teries that
<PB N="348" REF="3610">
appear in Mo&s;cow, and its neighbourhood, the mo&s;t remarkable is the Dewitze-mona&s;ter, about a mile from the city, where Peter confined his am|bitious &s;i&s;ter the prince&s;s Sophia, who had hatched &s;o many con&s;piracies again&s;t his government. This mona&s;tery, which is &s;ituated in an exten&s;ive plain, contains three hundred nuns, who are kept under &s;evere re&s;trictions, contrary to the freedom with which other Mu&s;covite nuns are indulged. The only liberty the&s;e enjoy is in holiday-time, when they are permitted to walk on the terraces of the garden, which overlook the adjacent plain.</P>
<P>Peter the Great founded at Mo&s;cow three col|leges, and &s;elected for them able profe&s;&s;ors. In the fir&s;t they taught humanity, rhetoric, and phi|lo&s;ophy; in the &s;econd mathematicks; and in the third navigation and a&s;tronomy. To the&s;e colleges he added a di&s;pen&s;atory, which is one of the no|ble&s;t &s;tructures in Mo&s;cow, compleatly furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of drugs and medicines, under the care of &s;ome Germans well &s;killed in the art of pharmacy and chymi&s;try. The yearly revenue of this di&s;pen&s;atory amounts to two thou&s;and rubles, allotted for fre&s;h &s;upplies of the <HI>materia medica;</HI> and from hence not only the army, but likewi&s;e all the chief cities of the empire are furni&s;hed.</P>
<P>The courts of judicature, cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, gaols, and other public edifices, are built of &s;tone, large, &s;trong, and ma&s;&s;y. The city of Mo&s;cow was founded in the year 1334, and in proce&s;s of time gradually enlarged it&s;elf to &s;uch a degree, that it is &s;aid to have contained eighty thou&s;and hou&s;es: but in the &s;equel it &s;uffered greatly, both from the enemy and &s;ucce&s;&s;ive conflagrations. Neverthele&s;s, in the reign of Charles II. of England, while lord Carlile was amba&s;&s;ador at that court, the city was twelve miles in compa&s;s, and the number of hou&s;es computed at forty thou&s;and. Notwith&s;tanding the
<PB N="349" REF="3620">
&s;everity and vigilance of the magi&s;tracy in Mo&s;|cow, the city &s;warms with &s;turdy beggars and va|gabonds, who render it very un&s;afe to walk through the &s;treets in the dark. Some of the&s;e, being armed with &s;hort truncheons, lurk in ob&s;cure corners, from whence they throw their weapons at the heads of pa&s;&s;engers with &s;uch dexterity, that they &s;eldom fail to knock them down: then they rob and murder them, and make off with the booty. The body of the per&s;on thus murdered is expo&s;ed in public for a certain time; and, if not owned, the magi&s;trates order it to be thrown into a large deep pit, dug on purpo&s;e for the interment of all tho&s;e who lo&s;e their lives in this manner: thither &s;ome prie&s;ts repair on Whit&s;untide-holidays, to &s;ay ma&s;s for the &s;ouls of the decea&s;ed. The antient &s;plendour and opulence of Mo&s;cow was greatly dimini&s;hed by the building of Peter&s;burg, and the removal of the court to that city. Never|thele&s;s the place is &s;till populous; and there is plenty of all kinds of provi&s;ion, extremely good, and &s;urpri&s;ingly cheap, except the article of fi&s;h, for which there is a very great demand, occa&s;ioned by the four great Lents, and weekly fa&s;ts ob&s;erved by the Ru&s;&s;ians. The canal between Mo&s;cow and Peter&s;burg is one of the mo&s;t &s;tupendous works of the czar Peter: it begins at the Nieva, and is con|tinued from lake to lake, and river to river, for near one hundred leagues, until it reaches Mo&s;cow. What is properly deemed the artificial canal, com|mences at the city of Novogorod, and is carried on with incredible labour and expence through the territories of Brognitz, Chri&s;titz, Chilolova, Wit&s;|chora, Volo&s;cha, Tor&s;chock, the province of Twere, and the di&s;trict of Kiln. The city of Mo&s;cow &s;tands about &s;ix hundred and fifty miles from Caffa, the capital of Crim Tartary; nine hundred and fifty miles from Con&s;tantinople; &s;even hundred
<PB N="350" REF="3630">
and twenty from Cracow in Poland; &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty from Stockholm; and one thou&s;and three hundred and twenty from London; in 55 degrees 42 minutes of north latitude.</P>
<P>Treytza, or Treytzki, is a &s;mall elegant town, about forty Engli&s;h miles to the northward of Mo&s;cow. It is famous for a &s;tately mona&s;tery, or convent, dedicated to the Trinity, and accommo|dated with a &s;pacious church, &s;tanding in the middle of the &s;quare. Sixty thou&s;and pea&s;ants are &s;aid to be dependant on this abbot, who is like|wi&s;e enriched with other revenues. Within the precincts of this convent is an imperial palace, &s;trongly fortified; to which the czar Peter, in his younger days, retired from the fury of the boyar Convan&s;ki, who, at the head of the Strelitzes, plundered or murdered all tho&s;e in the metropolis who pretended to oppo&s;e his ambitious and trea|&s;onable project, in concert with the Czar's &s;i&s;ter the prince&s;s Sophia.</P>
<P>Kolumna, &s;ituated on the we&s;tern bank of the river Occa, near the confines of the dutchy of Re&s;an, is a &s;mall town, formerly well fortified, though the walls and towers are now in ruins. It is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, and exhibits nothing remarkable but a noble church, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the archiepi&s;copal palace.</P>
<P>Colomen&s;ko, or Kolopimen&s;ki, a &s;mall town in the neighbourhood of Mo&s;cow, &s;tanding on an eminence that commands a fine pro&s;pect, is re|markable for little el&s;e than a large church, with two &s;tately towers, and a magnificent mona&s;tery. In approaching it by two avenues, the river Mo&s;ka mu&s;t be cro&s;&s;ed on a float of timber, contrived &s;o as to open and divide in the middle, and allow ve&s;&s;els to pa&s;s and repa&s;s. Mo&s;ac&s;ch, Wie&s;ma, Golutwina-&s;laboda, and Dmitroff, are little incon|&s;iderable

towns, that do not de&s;erve any particular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Ro&s;tow, lying between Mo&s;cow and Zaro&s;law, is a fertile country, bounded on the ea&s;t by Su&s;dal, and on the we&s;t by Twere. It was formerly the &s;econd dutchy of all Ru&s;&s;ia, governed by its own princes; the la&s;t of whom was &s;ubdued, taken, and put to death by the czar Iwan Ba&s;ilo|witz, who annexed this territory to his own de|me&s;nes. It was afterwards commonly a&s;&s;igned as an appanage for the maintenance of the Czarowitz, or heir apparent. Ro&s;tow abounds with corn, herbs, and fruits, and produces great variety of game; for the &s;ake of which the czar Peter fre|quently made an excur&s;ion hither in the hunting|&s;ea&s;on. The capital, Ro&s;tow, is a large town and metropolitan &s;ee, &s;ituated on the lake Ro&s;trow; from whence i&s;&s;ues the &s;mall river Cobris, or Ko|loper, that runs into the Wolga. There are &s;ome elegant &s;tone-churches in this city, which &s;tands about forty leagues to the northward of Mo&s;cow.</P>
<P>Uglitz, &s;eated on the Wolga, about &s;even and twenty leagues we&s;t of Ro&s;tow, is noted for its ex|cellent bread; but &s;till more famous for the mur|der of the young prince Demetrius, &s;on of the czar Iwan Ba&s;ilowitz. He was here &s;lain by order of his brother-in-law Frederowitz Godanow, during a tumult, occa&s;ioned by a conflagration rai&s;ed on purpo&s;e. The murderer u&s;urped the throne, and was &s;ucceeded by his &s;on of the &s;ame name, who proved an intolerable tyrant. He oppre&s;&s;ed the nobility in &s;uch a manner, that they countenanced an impo&s;tor, who pretended to be the prince De|metrius, and was crowned without oppo&s;ition in the year 1605; but in a little time the cheat was di&s;covered, and the Ru&s;&s;ians put him to death. Chlopigorod, &s;tanding on the &s;ame river Wolga, was formerly a place of con&s;iderable trade; but is
<PB N="352" REF="3650">
now almo&s;t ruined and abandoned. Peri&s;law is a large and populous city, &s;tanding at an equal di&s;|tance between Mo&s;cow and Ro&s;tow, well &s;upplied with game; on account of which it was often vi|&s;ited by the Czar and his attendants. There is nothing remarkable in the other towns of this pro|vince, known by the names of Mologa, Semebra|taff, Gna, Imbilowa-nova, and Ba&s;ma-nova.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Jaro&s;law, or Yero&s;law, lies be|tween Mo&s;cow and Vologda; is a fertile country, abounding with corn, cattle, and honey, and wa|tered by the river Wolga, which runs through the heart of the province. Jaro&s;law, the capital, is a large populous city, &s;aid to contain forty thou&s;and inhabitants, &s;trongly fortified, enjoying a con&s;ider|able commerce in corn, cattle, leather, and honey, &s;ituated on the river Wolga, about twelve leagues to the northward of the city of Ro&s;tow. The other towns of this di&s;trict, worth mentioning, are Roma-nova and Damelofke: the fir&s;t &s;tands on the Wolga, about &s;even leagues to the we&s;tward of Jaro&s;law, and on the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the river.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Bilejezora, or Belozero, is a &s;mall province, almo&s;t circular, deriving its name from a lake called Biele-ozoro, or the White Lake, on the banks of which &s;tands the capital of the &s;ame name. This country, bounded by Jaro&s;law on the ea&s;t, by Wologda on the north, by Great Novo|gorod on the we&s;t, and by the dutchy of Twere on the &s;outh, is &s;o encumbered with woods, lakes, and fens, that the roads are impa&s;&s;able, except in the winter, when the waters are frozen. The lakes are well &s;tored with fi&s;h; nay, &s;ome parts of the province are well inhabited, producing plenty of corn and good pa&s;ture. The lake of Biele-ozoro extends thirteen leagues in length, and in &s;ome places is &s;even leagues broad.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="3660">
The capital, Belozero, is large, populous, well fortified, and particularly &s;ecured by a ca&s;tle, which is &s;urrounded by the water of the lake, and e&s;teemed impregnable. There is no other con&s;iderable town in this dutchy but Geblowa-&s;laboda, &s;tanding on the river Mologa; by means of which, and its con|fluence with the Volga a little below the town, the inhabitants enjoy a good &s;hare of traffick.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Wologda, bounded on the we&s;t by Bilejezora, on the north by the dutchies of Gar|gapol and Ou&s;tiong, on the &s;outh by Jaro&s;law, and on the ea&s;t by the river Dwina, is a large, woody, and mountainous province, inter&s;per&s;ed with lakes and fens: the fore&s;ts abound with all &s;orts of game, and the waters with fi&s;h; but the people labour under a &s;carcity of other provi&s;ions. Wologda, the capital, &s;ituated on both &s;ides of a river of the &s;ame name, is a large and populous city, inhabited by a rich trading people. This is the pa&s;s through which all commodities mu&s;t be conveyed to and from Archangel; and here is a good number of magazines and &s;tores, kept by the merchants of England, Holland, and other nations. The city is &s;urrounded with a &s;trong wall of &s;tone, and de|fended by a fortre&s;s &s;o &s;trong, that, in times of danger, the Czars &s;end hither their mo&s;t valuable effects, as to a place of &s;afety. Wologda &s;tands about &s;eventy-five leagues to the northward of Mo&s;cow, and is one of the mo&s;t antient archiepi&s;|copal &s;ees in all Ru&s;&s;ia. The hou&s;es are well built, the &s;treets open and regular, and the bazars or markets well furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of merchan|dize. Every article, however, is &s;old in its own peculiar quarter; the furs in one, the fle&s;h in an|other, the wood in a third, and the cloths in a fourth. The river, which is broad and navigable, contributes in a great mea&s;ure to the traffick of the city. Be&s;ides the cathedral, called Saboor, which
<PB N="354" REF="3670">
is a magnificent &s;tructure, having five &s;tately cu|polas covered with tin, and &s;urmounted with cro&s;&s;es finely gilt; there are twenty churches in this city built of &s;tone, and forty-three of timber. There are moreover three nunneries, each pro|vided with an elegant &s;tone chapel, built in the centre. Dwinitza, &s;ituated on a river of the &s;ame name, which falls into the Wologda, is a &s;mall town, well peopled. Soo&s;ka and Stralitz are towns of &s;ome little importance, &s;tanding on the river Wologda: but there is no other place in this pro|vince that de&s;erves notice.</P>
<P>The province of Kargapol, lying to the north|ward of Wologda, is a large tract of land, &s;tretch|ing almo&s;t to the White Sea, covered with fore&s;ts, fens, and &s;mall lakes, and inter&s;ected by a great number of rivers: the chief of the&s;e is the One|ga, taking its ri&s;e in this province, and running into the White Sea. The inhabitants of this di&s;|trict are extremely ignorant, rude, and barbarous, little more civilized than the Laplanders, and living pretty much in their manner. They have no towns worth mentioning but the capital Kargapol, &s;ituat|ed on the we&s;tern bank of the Onega, about &s;ix|teen German leagues to the ea&s;tward of the great lake which bears that name.</P>
<P>The province of Waga, lying to the north-we&s;t of Kargapol, is of con&s;iderable extent, but woody, wild, and de&s;olate. Here are no towns that de|&s;erve the lea&s;t notice but Waga and Wied, both &s;ituated on the &s;ame river Waga, which falls into the Dwina.</P>
<P>Onega, lying to the we&s;tward of Waga, is a long, narrow, barren province, covered with woods, and thinly inhabited, without any city or town of im|portance, except Korel&s;koi, which &s;tands near the mouth of the river Onega, on the &s;outhern coa&s;t of the White Sea.</P>
<P><PB N="355" REF="3680">
Of much more importance is the province of Dwina, extending it&s;elf near one hundred leagues, in form of a lozenge; bounded on the north by the White Sea, and part of Ingria; on the we&s;t by Waga and Onega, from which it is parted by the river Dwina; on the &s;outh by the province of Ou|&s;tiong; and on the ea&s;t by part of Zirania. It is watered by &s;everal rivers, be&s;ides the Dwina; but woody, mountainous, and barren. The ground produces no corn, and but very little pa&s;ture, &s;o that few cattle are bred in this province. The in|habitants live chiefly on dried fi&s;h; and their &s;taple commodity is &s;alt, the &s;ale of which con&s;tituted their &s;ole traffick until the Engli&s;h extended their commerce to Archangel. Since that period this town became one of the chief marts for all the commodities of Mu&s;covy: the city &s;oon grew rich, and its wealth was diffu&s;ed through the whole pro|vince, which abounds with large towns, wealthy, and well inhabited. The capital, Archangel, or St. Michael the Archangel, by the Ru&s;&s;ians called Archania, is &s;ituated on the ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Dwina, about &s;ix leagues above the place where that river falls into the White Sea. The city extends about two miles in length, is rich, populous, and built in the modern ta&s;te. It is a metropolitan &s;ee, and &s;tands between the &s;ixty-fourth and &s;ixty-fifth de|grees of northern latitude. Archangel owed its wealth and importance originally to the Engli&s;h, by whom it was di&s;covered in the year 1553. Richard Chancellor, ma&s;ter of one of the &s;hips fitted out under the command of Sir Hugh Wil|loughby, who had received a commi&s;&s;ion to go in que&s;t of the north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age to China, was &s;epa|rated from the re&s;t of the fleet, and obliged by &s;tre&s;s of weather to put into the bay of St. Nicho|las, on the White Sea. The czar Iwan Ba&s;ilowitz, being informed of his arrival, invited him to his
<PB N="356" REF="3690">
court, where he was ho&s;pitably entertained; and the Czar indulged the Engli&s;h with a free trade in his dominions: in con&s;equence of this permi&s;&s;ion, a company of merchants was incorporated in Lon|don; and, being encouraged by particular privi|leges from the Czar, &s;et on foot a con&s;iderable commerce, to the mutual advantage of both na|tions. Before this period, the Ru&s;&s;ian commodities were u&s;ually conveyed to Narva, in the gulph of Finland: but the channel of trade was &s;oon turned to Archangel, and this traffick the Engli&s;h for &s;ome time enjoyed without competition. The Dutch, however, and other nations, gradually in&s;inuated them&s;elves into this commerce, which they carried on to a very great di&s;advantage, as not being fa|voured with tho&s;e privileges which the Czar had granted to the Engli&s;h company: the&s;e were at length unhappily lo&s;t, in the time of the great re|bellion. When the Czar heard that the Engli&s;h na|tion had brought their &s;overeign to the &s;caffold, he was &s;o exa&s;perated again&s;t them, that he forthwith deprived them of the immunities in trade which they had hitherto enjoyed in the dominions of Ru&s;|&s;ia; nor could our company, with all its efforts, retrieve them in the &s;equel, &s;o that our merchants were obliged to trade at Archangel on the footing of other European nations.</P>
<P>The commodities chiefly imported into Arch|angel were gold and &s;ilver &s;tuffs and laces, gold wire, cochineal, indigo, and other drugs for dy|ing; wine, brandy, and other di&s;tilled &s;pirits. The cu&s;toms ari&s;ing to the Czar were computed at two hundred thou&s;and rubles a year, and the number of foreign &s;hips at four hundred annually: but &s;ince the ports of Peter&s;burg and Riga were open|ed, great part of the trade has been removed to the Baltic, and the commerce of Archangel is greatly decayed.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="3700">
The hou&s;es of Archangel are generally of wood, but well contrived; and every chamber is pro|vided with a &s;tove, as a fence again&s;t the cold, which is here exce&s;&s;ive in the winter. The &s;treets are paved with broken pieces of timber and rub|bi&s;h, di&s;po&s;ed &s;o un&s;kilfully, that one cannot walk over it without running the ri&s;que of falling, ex|cept when the &s;treets are rendered &s;mooth and equal by the &s;now that falls, and freezes in the winter. Notwith&s;tanding the &s;everity of the cold in this place, there is always plenty of good pro|vi&s;ions: butcher's meat, poultry, wild fowl, and fi&s;h, in great variety, are &s;old &s;urpri&s;ingly cheap. A brace of partridges may be bought for four pence. The&s;e birds, as well as the hares of this country, grow white in the winter; and when the weather becomes more mild, re&s;ume their natural colour.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable edifice in Archangel is a large town-hou&s;e, built of &s;quare &s;tones in the Italian manner, and divided into three parts: one of the&s;e con&s;i&s;ts of large commodious apartments, for the accommodation of merchants, &s;trangers as well as natives: here they are permitted to re&s;ide with their merchandize till the month of October, when all the foreign &s;hips &s;et &s;ail for the re&s;pective countries to which they belong. Then the traders are obliged to remove their quarters from the town-hou&s;e or palace, which hath a &s;pacious court, that reaches down to the river.</P>
<P>The government of Archangel was lodged in the governor till the fir&s;t year of the pre&s;ent cen|tury, when the Czar appointed four burgoma&s;ters to regulate all civil and mercantile affairs; &s;o that now the governor's power is confined to the militia. The court &s;ends hither yearly a commi&s;&s;ioner to receive the cu&s;toms, which are collected by four deputies in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P><PB N="358" REF="3710">
St. Nicholas, another &s;ea-port, &s;tands upon the White Sea, about &s;even leagues we&s;t of Archangel. From this place the whole bay of St. Nicholas de|rived its name; but at pre&s;ent-the town and trade are very incon&s;iderable.</P>
<P>Next to Archangel, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable town in this province is Colmogorod, the &s;eat of a Ru&s;|&s;ian archbi&s;hop. It is &s;ituated on the we&s;tern bank of the Dwina, about ten leagues above Archangel, near the place where the Pinega falls into that river.</P>
<P>Neva Dwin&s;ka is a &s;trong fortre&s;s, lately built to defend the mouth of the new canal, or the mo&s;t northern opening of the Dwina on the White Sea. It is furni&s;hed with a large wooden bridge over the river, the middle part of which can be drawn up occa&s;ionally for the pa&s;&s;age of ve&s;&s;els.</P>
<P>Sottotitza, otherwi&s;e Sottowitzogda, is a large city, &s;tanding on the &s;outhern confines of this pro|vince, inhabited by many con&s;iderable merchants and curious mechanicks. In the neighbourhood there is a territory of very con&s;iderable extent, called Wollo&s;tu&s;gy; the inhabitants of which are a civilized people, who &s;peak a language peculiar to them&s;elves, profe&s;s the doctrines of the Greek church, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to have come originally from Livonia.</P>
<P>We &s;hall conclude this article by mentioning the i&s;land Martinowitz, lying on the north-we&s;t coa&s;t of the province called Ingoria, from which it is parted by an oblong lake, terminating at each end in a narrow &s;treight. The i&s;land &s;tretches about forty-five leagues in length, and eighteen in breadth, lying between the forty-third and forty|&s;eventh degrees of ea&s;t longitude from London. It extends near two degrees to the northward of the Artic Circle, is covered with woods and fore&s;ts, and watered by &s;everal rivers, &s;uch as the Toyna,

Carana, Colcowa, &amp;c. and in &s;ome of the be&s;t maps is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of O&s;trow Kan|deno&s;s. Here is likewi&s;e a town and a cape, well known by the names of Kandeno&s;s and Candenora; but the &s;everity of the climate is &s;carce tolerable.</P>
<P>Still farther to the northward we meet with an|other &s;maller i&s;land, called Kalgew, or Kolgow, of which we can give no particular account.</P>
<P>Having thus taken a &s;ummary view of the we&s;tern provinces in Ru&s;&s;ia, we &s;hall now proceed to de|&s;cribe tho&s;e that con&s;titute the ea&s;tern divi&s;ion, namely, Mezen, Ingora, Candora, and Tee&s;ca Pet|zora, the country of the Vogali&s;e, Permia, Ou|&s;tiong, Zirania, and Viatka. We &s;hall afterwards di&s;tingui&s;h the provinces of Mu&s;covian Tartary, Ca&s;an, Bulgara, Bo&s;kiria, A&s;tracan, Siberia, and Samoieda, as well as tho&s;e that are comprehended in Ru&s;&s;ian Lapland.</P>
<P>The territory of Mezen lies to the northward of Dwina and the river Prega, and extends northerly to Ingora and the &s;treights of Kandeno&s;s, a long narrow tract of land, abounding with fore&s;ts, fens, and mountains, barren, cold, and comfortle&s;s. The chief town, called Mezzen, and the other villages belonging to this di&s;trict, are wretched places, un|worthy of particular de&s;cription.</P>
<P>The next province, of Ingora, is equally cold, barren, mar&s;hy, woody, and mountainous, bounded on the north by the Frozen Ocean, and on the &s;outh by the provinces of Ou&s;tiong and Permia. It is a large tract of country, extending a con&s;iderable way beyond the Polar Circle, and watered by a great number of rivers, among which we number the Fitza, Golocbentza, Golocbicca, Otmas Oy|metza, Pietza, &amp;c. which flow northwards into the gulph of Tee&s;ca. The inhabitants are as brutal as the Samoiedes, whom they re&s;emble in their feed|ing on the raw guts and garbage of animals; but
<PB N="360" REF="3730">
their language is different. In the middle of the province is the territory of Vaconitza Volo&s;t, in|cluding a few &s;cattered towns or villages. On the &s;outhern part it is divided from Zirania by the Ju|gorian mountains, which are always covered with ice and &s;now. The chief town, Jugora, or Juhora, &s;tands on a bay of the &s;ame name on the northern coa&s;t, between the i&s;le of Kandeno&s;s and the gulph of Petzer&s;kaia. The other places of this province are too incon&s;iderable to be mentioned.</P>
<P>Permia, one of the large&s;t provinces in the Ru&s;|&s;ian empire, is bounded on the north by the coun|try of the Vogulizi, on the ea&s;t by Siberia, on the &s;outh by the province of Vaitka, and on the we&s;t by Ou&s;tiong. It extends near nine degrees of la|titude in length, and is in &s;ome places &s;ixty leagues broad; is watered by &s;ome large rivers, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of which is the Kama, ri&s;ing from a long chain of mountains, which &s;eparates the pro|vince from Siberia, and &s;tretch them&s;elves from the kingdom of Ca&s;an to the coa&s;t of the Frozen Sea. This country is full of lakes and mountains, and the &s;oil &s;o unkindly, that it produces nothing but peas, beans, and other pul&s;e, which the natives eat in&s;tead of bread. They &s;peak a language pe|culiar to them&s;elves, have their own cu&s;toms and religion, and pay to the Ru&s;&s;ian emperor a yearly tribute in furs and hor&s;es. The capital, Solikam|&s;koi, is &s;aid to be a large and opulent city, inha|bited by many con&s;iderable merchants, who traffick in &s;alt; of which commodity great quantities are here made, and &s;hipped in large ve&s;&s;els built for that purpo&s;e. The&s;e ve&s;&s;els &s;ail down the Kama into the Volga, which di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Ca&s;pian Sea below A&s;tracan. Other geographers and travellers &s;ay the chief city of this province is Permia Velikaia, &s;ituated near the confluence of the Kama and the Wi&s;&s;ora, in the latitude of &s;ixty-two:
<PB N="361" REF="3740">
they likewi&s;e enumerate a great number of other cities and towns, of which we know very few particulars.</P>
<P>The country of U&s;ting, or Ou&s;tiough, lies to the we&s;tward of Permia, and to the &s;outhward of Waga and Dwina, a &s;mall barren province, covered with impenetrable woods, that afford &s;helter to a great number of black foxes, which yield valuable furs. The rivers Jugh and Suchana ri&s;e in dif|ferent parts of this province, and, meeting near the middle, form the Dwina, &s;o called from its being compo&s;ed of a double &s;tream: but before the&s;e two rivers join, the Suchana is &s;welled by many different &s;treams: at the mouth of one of the&s;e &s;tands the mona&s;tery of Teelego. Some of the frontiers of this province are watered by the Waga, which falls into the Dwina. The river Ou&s;tiong &s;prings in this province, and di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Suchana. The capital, Ou&s;tiough, from O&s;tium Jugae, &s;tands on the we&s;tern banks of the Suchana, into which the Jugh falls, a little below the town. This place is a metropolitan &s;ee, and was formerly thought &s;o &s;trong, that in times of danger the Czars &s;ent hither their mo&s;t valuable effects. The city is &s;till con&s;iderable, extending about a league, in form of a cre&s;cent. The mo&s;t remarkable building is the archiepi&s;copal palace, which is large and gloomy. There are ten or twelve churches built of &s;tone, and covered with tin: the other churches, and the hou&s;es in general, are of timber. It is &s;urrounded with &s;tone walls; &s;tands about two hundred and twenty miles to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Archangel, and is chiefly noted for a yearly fair of fox-&s;kins, and other peltry. The other towns are Wiod, Sana&s;terwa, Wid&s;ogkaia&s;al, Totma, Totma-Starmia, Woltazemeetz-Godorick, Brou&s;inkoi-Godorick, and Dwina: but all the&s;e are incon&s;iderable.</P>

The province of Zirania, or Zarani, is a long narrow tract of land, &s;tretching from the &s;ixtieth to the &s;ixty-fifth degree of latitude, almo&s;t totally covered with impenetrable woods, and haunted by an incredible number of wild bea&s;ts: the land mu&s;t of con&s;equence be barren, and thinly inhabited. The people live &s;cattered in villages, compo&s;ed of wretched huts; are fierce, bruti&s;h, and intractable. They live by hunting, clothe them&s;elves with part of the &s;kins, and exchange the overplus with their neighbours for tho&s;e nece&s;&s;aries without which they cannot well &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Their chief villages are known by the names of Zericow, Touria, Ou&s;twina, Ookla, Vey&s;ema, Laren&s;coi, Ou&s;oy, Relencitz, Ou&s;i&s;&s;oli, and Ker&s;a; all of them mi&s;erable places, unworthy of further notice.</P>
<P>The dutchy of Viatka, or Wiad&s;ki, is the la&s;t province of ea&s;tern Mu&s;covy, bounded on the &s;outh by the kingdom of Ca&s;an, and on the ea&s;t by part of Siberia. It was conquered from the Tartars by the czar Iwan Ba&s;ilowitz, and was then almo&s;t de|&s;erted, on account of the incur&s;ions of the Schire|mi&s;&s;e Tartars; but now it fares much better, as both nations have been &s;ubdued by the Ru&s;&s;ians. This province, though woody, mar&s;hy, and bar|ren, produces a great quantity of honey, wax, and furs. It is watered by the river Vaitka, which takes its ri&s;e within the province, and wa&s;hing &s;e|veral towns, after a &s;hort cour&s;e, falls into the Kama. On that river &s;tands the capital, Viatka, a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, provided with a &s;trong ca&s;tle, built by the czar Ba&s;ilowitz, to check the incur&s;ions of the Tartars. The place can boa&s;t of nothing el&s;e remarkable, except two roads leading from hence to Mo&s;cow; one of which, though &s;horter, is much more dangerous than the other, becau&s;e it runs through va&s;t mora&s;&s;es, and is infe&s;ted by the Schi|remi&s;&s;e free-booters. Colclinitz is another con&s;i|derable
<PB N="363" REF="3760">
town of this dutchy, &s;ituated on the &s;ame river, near the frontiers of the kingdom of Ca&s;an. Slaboda &s;tands more to the north-we&s;t, on the bor|ders of the Schiremi&s;&s;e Tartars. Be&s;ides the&s;e, the province includes Clinow, Ortow, and Kaigorod, all fortified after the Ru&s;&s;ian manner: but the Czars having enlarged their dominions by conque&s;t, the&s;e fortifications are become u&s;ele&s;s, and neglected ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>Mu&s;covian Tartary, in Europe, comprehends Ca&s;an, Bulgaria, Ba&s;kiria, A&s;tracan, Siberia, and Samoieda. Ca&s;an, called by the Ru&s;&s;ians Czar&s;ti|no Cazan&s;koi, is a kingdom, formerly governed by its own monarchs, who were rich and powerful. The czar Ba&s;ilowitz &s;ubdued the greater part of it, after a long and bloody war; and the conque&s;t was fini&s;hed in the year 1554, by his &s;on Iwan Ba&s;ilo|witz, who likewi&s;e added the kingdom of A&s;tracan to his dominions. Since that period, the&s;e two kingdoms have been con&s;idered as the riche&s;t jewels in the Ru&s;&s;ian diadem; Ca&s;an for its ferti|lity, and A&s;tracan on account of its commerce. Ca&s;an is bounded on the north by the provinces of Vaitka and Permia; on the ea&s;t by Tumaean Tar|tary; on the &s;outh by Ba&s;keria, Bulgaria, and A&s;|tracan; on the we&s;t by the Lower Novogorod and Mu&s;covy Proper. The &s;oil, naturally fertile, is watered by the two great rivers, Volga and Kama, which not only render the ground &s;till more fertile, but enrich the province with traffick. Cazan, or Cazanum, the capital, &s;tands in the latitude of fifty-&s;ix degrees, fifty-four minutes, on the river Ca&s;anka, in the mid&s;t of a &s;pacious and fruitful plain. It is a large and populous city, the &s;eat of a Ru&s;&s;ian metropolitan, abounding with a great number of churches, mona&s;teries, and &s;pires, which yield a magnificent pro&s;pect, both from the land, and from the ve&s;&s;els that are continually &s;ailing up
<PB N="364" REF="3770">
and down the Volga, into which the Ca&s;anka falls about four miles below the city. The hou&s;es in general, as well as the ramparts and towers, are built of wood. The ca&s;tle, however, is fortified with &s;tone walls, &s;urrounded by the river, which forms a formidable fo&s;&s;e, well &s;tored with artillery and ammunition, &s;ecured by a &s;trong garri&s;on of Ru&s;&s;ian &s;oldiers, under the command of its own waiwode, independent of the governor of the city. At the confluence of the Ca&s;anka and the Volga, there is a large commodious dock for building &s;hipping, and other ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable bur|then, to carry on the commerce of the Volga and the Ca&s;pian Sea. Ca&s;an is well &s;upplied, by land and water, with all &s;orts of nece&s;&s;aries and provi|&s;ions, &s;old very cheap, and in great abundance. Wine and fruits are brought hither from Turkey: Mo&s;cow &s;upplies the inhabitants with groceries, and European commodities: they receive furs and iron work from Siberia and Tartary: tea is im|ported by the annual caravans that arrive from China. It is admirably &s;ituated for the commerce of the &s;outhern parts of this empire, and accord|ingly we reckon it the third great magazine in Ru&s;&s;ia for all &s;orts of merchandize. The merchants of Ca&s;an formerly maintained a con&s;iderable com|merce with Khieva, Bokhara, and other places of Tartary, which is now lo&s;t; but the trade with Per&s;ia &s;till continues. Here are &s;everal manufac|tures of red Ru&s;&s;ia leather, large quantities of which are &s;ent annually to Peter&s;burg. The terri|tory abounds with oaks, which yield plenty of bark for tanning: the timber u&s;ed for the navy is felled in the neighbourhood of the city, and is counted excellent for the purpo&s;e of &s;hip-building.

the lake of Ladoga: but two &s;ummers are com|monly &s;pent in this tedious conveyance. A great number of Tartars live in the neighbourhood of Ca&s;an, which is a plea&s;ant and fruitful country. They are neat and cleanly in their per&s;ons, and &s;upply the markets with hor&s;es, &s;heep, and all other kinds of cattle, which produce abundance of tal|low. Provi&s;ions are &s;ent in great quantities from hence to A&s;tracan, and to all the towns and &s;ettle|ments on the Volga. About twenty-four leagues we&s;t of Ca&s;an &s;tands the &s;mall city of Kock&s;chaga, on the bank of the Volga, where &s;ometimes there is not water enough to float large ve&s;&s;els. Mal|mi&s;has, a paultry town on the &s;ide of the river Ca|&s;anka, near the frontiers of Bulgaria, &s;urrounded with a wooden wall, and thinly peopled with in|digent inhabitants. About three miles from the Volga are the ruins of Scrulier&s;ki, &s;aid to have been a large opulent city, between Ca&s;an and A&s;tracan, de&s;troyed by the great Tamerlane. The re&s;t of the towns in this kingdom are Lai&s;off, Sabackzar, Pagantzina, Swat&s;k, Kolcis, Tetul, Karakul, Sun|der, Batula, Bur, and Uza; but none of them de&s;erve particular regard.</P>
<P>The kingdom of Bulgaria, otherwi&s;e known by the name of Horda, or region of the Zavolani, was antiently inhabited by the Bulgares, who made an irruption into the&s;e parts from A&s;ia, and con|ferred their name on this country, which is divided into Great and Little, or A&s;ian and European Bul|garia. European Bulgaria lies along the &s;outhern coa&s;ts of the Danube, and was heretofore annexed to the kingdom of Hungary; from which, how|ever, it was conquered by &s;ultan Amurath II. and then it became part of Turkey in Europe: as &s;uch it will be de&s;cribed in its proper place. <Q>Bulgaria the Great, which was &s;ubdued by the czars of Mu&s;|covy, is bounded on the north by the kingdom of

Ca&s;an; on the ea&s;t by Ba&s;kiria; on the &s;outh by the river Sumara, which divides it from the king|dom of A&s;tracan; and on the we&s;t by the Volga. This country is watered by the Kama, Belema, Adroba, Volga, Cami&s;amar, and Semmiour. Near the centre of the kingdom are the de&s;arts of Ufa. It is terminated on the ea&s;t by a ridge of high mountains; part of which, being the mountains of Caf, yield abundance of iron, chry&s;tal, and other valuable &s;tones. On the &s;outhern &s;ide is the large lake Kerghewl; and a mona&s;tery of the order of St. Ba&s;il on the &s;ide of the river Beleia. We are little acquainted with the nature of the &s;oil, and the produce of the country; but the province mu&s;t be populous, if we may be allowed to judge from the number and &s;ize of the cities it contains. Bul|gar, or Bulgara, the capital, &s;tands on the Volga, and is counted one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable cities in Ru&s;&s;ia: Samara, &s;ituated on the river of the &s;ame name, which falls into the Volga, is built on the declivity of a mountain, and the &s;uburbs &s;tretch along the banks of the river: the place is large; but the hou&s;es are generally wretched, they, as well as the walls and fortifications, being built of timber. The city of Samara is &s;aid to have been rai&s;ed in one month, by thirty thou&s;and men &s;ent thither, in the reign of the czar Peter. The work was directed by prince Gali&s;chin; and the place proved of excellent u&s;e, not only in repre&s;&s;ing the incur&s;ions of the Tartars and Co&s;&s;acks, but like|wi&s;e in affording magazines to &s;upply the army in that province with all kinds of provi&s;ion and nece&s;|&s;aries. Simberka, or Simber&s;kaigoras, a large and opulent city, advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, was, with many others, de&s;troyed by Tamerlane. We are told by John Struits, in his Voyages, that, going a&s;hore at this place, he a&s;cended a mountain, where formerly &s;tood the city of Abuchim, and there di&s;|covered

<P>Ba&s;kiria, inhabited by the Ba&s;kiri Tartars, lies to the &s;outhward of Bulgaria and the Tumaean Tar|tary; but the country is &s;o little known, that we can give no account of its &s;oil, produce, cities, or inhabitants. Here however is the mount Albater, from whence i&s;&s;ue the two rivulets called Vye and Lo&s;trama. The&s;e, after a cour&s;e of &s;ome leagues, joining, form the river Tobol, which runs into Si|beria, and gives its name to the city Tobol&s;koi, capital of that province. From part of Bulgaria this province is divided by a ridge of mountains, that produce iron and chry&s;tal: here al&s;o is the lake Jakaia, i&s;&s;uing in the river Jaick, which wa|ters part of this country, and falls into the Ca&s;pian Sea.</P>
<P>The kingdom of A&s;tracan is the mo&s;t ea&s;tern province in Europe, bounded on the north by Bul|garia and Ba&s;kiria; on the &s;outh by the Ca&s;pian Sea; on the we&s;t by the Volga, which divides it from the Nagayan Tartars and Don Co&s;&s;acks; and on the ea&s;t by the great ridge of mountains which part it from Great Tartary. The province extends from the forty-&s;ixth to the fifty-&s;econd degree of latitude. The &s;ummer is long, and inten&s;ely hot: the winter continues about three months &s;o &s;evere, that the Volga is frozen hard enough to bear loaded &s;ledges. The &s;oil is rich and fertile; but the Tar|tars
<PB N="368" REF="3820">
who inhabit it are &s;trangers to agriculture. On the we&s;tern and &s;outhern &s;ides of the Volga are heaths of a prodigious extent, &s;andy, de&s;art, and uncultivated: the&s;e, however, produce va&s;t quan|tities of fine tran&s;parent &s;alt in pits, where the &s;un bakes and incru&s;tates it to the thickne&s;s of an inch on the &s;urface of the water. There are pits in the neighbourhood of A&s;tracan which yield this excel|lent &s;alt in &s;uch abundance, that any per&s;on may carry it off, paying at the rate of one farthing a poo&s;t, which is equal to forty pounds. The me|tropolis, A&s;tracan, is &s;ituated within the bounda|ries of A&s;ia, on an i&s;land called Dolgoi, about &s;ixty Engli&s;h miles above the place where the Vol|ga di&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Ca&s;pian Sea. The city derives its name from Hadgee Tarken, a Tar|tar, by whom it was founded. It was conquered by Iwan Ba&s;ilowitz, recovered by the Tartars in the year 1668, and retaken by the Czar, who em|ployed for this purpo&s;e a great number of flat|bottomed ve&s;&s;els, in which he tran&s;ported his forces down the Volga from Ca&s;an. The city of A&s;tra|can is about two miles and a half in circumference, &s;urrounded by a brick wall, which is now in a ruin|ous condition: but, if we comprehend the &s;uburbs, the circuit will be near five miles. The number of inhabitants amounts to &s;eventy thou&s;and, in|cluding Armenians and Tartars, as well as a few Per&s;ians and Indians. The garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix regiments of the be&s;t Ru&s;&s;ian troops, who, when this place was alarmed from the &s;ide of Per&s;ia, had in the adjacent plain erected a great number of &s;mall batteries, to &s;cour the fields, and ob&s;truct the approach of the enemy. The hou&s;es of A&s;tracan are built of wood, and generally mean and incon|venient. The higher parts of the city command a pro&s;pect of the Volga, which is here about three miles in breadth, and exhibits a noble appearance.

The mar&s;hy lands on the banks of it render the place very &s;ickly in the &s;ummer: the earth, being impregnated with &s;alt, is extremely fertile, and produces abundance of fruit, the immoderate u&s;e of which is attended with epidemical di&s;tempers. Sickne&s;s is likewi&s;e the con&s;equence of tho&s;e annual changes in the atmo&s;phere, produced by the floods in &s;pring and autumn. All round the city of A&s;|tracan, at the di&s;tance of two miles, we &s;ee a great number of gardens, orchards, and vineyards, pro|ducing all &s;orts of herbs and roots, (except cauli|flowers,) artichoaks, and potatoes, apples, pears, cherries, grapes, and excellent water-melons; which la&s;t, though remarkably juicy, grow be&s;t in a &s;andy &s;oil. The grapes are counted &s;o delicious, that they are pre&s;erved in &s;and, and tran&s;ported to court by land-carriage, at a prodigious ex|pence: yet the wine of A&s;tracan is very indiffe|rent. The &s;ummer being generally dry, the in|habitants water their gardens by means of large wheels worked by wind or hor&s;es, which rai&s;e the water to the highe&s;t part of the garden, from which it runs in trenches to refre&s;h the roots of every &s;ingle tree and plant. The neighbouring country produces hares and partridges, plenty of quails in &s;ummer, with wild, and water fowl of all &s;orts in abundance. About ten miles below A&s;|tracan is a &s;mall i&s;land, called Bo&s;maife, on which are built large &s;tore-hou&s;es for the &s;alt which is made about twelve miles to the ea&s;tward, and, being brought hither in boats, is conveyed up the Volga, in order to &s;upply the country as far as Mo&s;cow and Twere. The quantity of &s;alt an|nually dug for the&s;e purpo&s;es amounts to &s;ome millions of pounds, the exclu&s;ive property of which is claimed by the crown, and yields a con&s;iderable revenue; for the &s;oldiers and bulk of the people live almo&s;t intirely on bread and &s;alt. The neigh|bourhood
<PB N="370" REF="3850">
of the&s;e &s;alt-works is of great advan|tage to the fi&s;heries, which extend from hence to the Ca&s;pian Sea, and reach to the &s;outh-ea&s;t as far as Yack, and even an hundred miles above Zarit|zen. The principal fi&s;h here caught are &s;turgeon, &s;tarlett, belluga, and a&s;&s;otra. The&s;e, being &s;alted, are put on board of ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ent away in the &s;pring, for the u&s;e of the whole empire, even as far as Peter&s;burg: but, as fi&s;h may be kept fre&s;h &s;o long as it is frozen, the winter is no &s;ooner &s;et in, than they tran&s;port great quantities of it by land, through all the provinces of Ru&s;&s;ia. Of the roes of the fi&s;h called belluga, which are white, tran&s;parent, and of an agreeable flavour, the fi&s;hers here prepare the caviare, which is in &s;o much e&s;teem all over Europe. The&s;e fi&s;heries were fir&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed by one Tikon Demedoff, a carrier, who &s;ettled in this place about half a century ago, his whole wealth con&s;i&s;ting of two hor&s;es. By dint of &s;kill and indu&s;try, he &s;oon grew the riche&s;t merchant in this country: but his &s;ucce&s;s became &s;o alluring to the crown, that of late years it hath engro&s;&s;ed &s;ome of the fi&s;heries, as well as the &s;alt|works. From the latter end of July to the be|ginning of October, the country about A&s;tracan is frequently infe&s;ted with myriads of locu&s;ts, which darken the air in their progre&s;&s;ion from the north to the &s;outhward; and wherever they fall, con&s;ume the whole verdure of the earth. The&s;e in&s;ects can even live for &s;ome time under water: for when the wind blows acro&s;s the Volga, va&s;t num|bers of them fall in clu&s;ters, and are rolled a&s;hore; and their wings are no &s;ooner dry, than they ri&s;e and take flight again. Heretofore the inhabitants of A&s;tracan traded to Khuva and Bokhara; but at pre&s;ent the&s;e branches are lo&s;t, and their com|merce is limited to Per&s;ia and the dominions of Ru&s;&s;ia. Even the trade to Per&s;ia is much dimi|ni&s;hed
<PB N="371" REF="3860">
by the troubles of that country: neverthe|le&s;s, the commerce of A&s;tracan is &s;till con&s;iderable. A few years ago, the city maintained about forty ve&s;&s;els, from one to two hundred tons burthen, for the Ca&s;pian traffick. Some of the&s;e belong to the government, and are commanded by a com|modore, under the direction of the admiralty. This office is generally well &s;tocked with naval &s;tores, which are &s;old occa&s;ionally to the mer|chants. The trading &s;hips convey provi&s;ions to the frontier towns of Terkie and Ki&s;lar, &s;ituated on the Ca&s;pian Sea; and tran&s;port merchandize to &s;everal parts of Per&s;ia. Some years ago, the Engli&s;h Ru&s;&s;ian company opened a trade from A&s;tracan to Per&s;ia over the Ca&s;pian Sea, and &s;hips were built for that purpo&s;e; but this commerce was &s;oon prohibited by the Czarina, in con&s;e|quence of the mi&s;management of an Engli&s;h factor, and the jealou&s;y of the Ru&s;&s;ians. The merchants of A&s;tracan export to Per&s;ia, chiefly on account of the Armenians, red leather, linnens, woollen cloths, and other European manufactures. In return, they import the commodities of Per&s;ia, particularly tho&s;e manufactured at Ca&s;an; &s;uch as &s;ilk &s;a&s;hes intermixed with gold, for the u&s;e of the Poles; wrought &s;ilks and &s;tuffs mixed with cotton; rice, cotton, rhubarb, and a &s;mall quantity of other drugs; but the chief commodity is raw &s;ilk. The government has engro&s;&s;ed the article of rhubarb, the greater part of which is brought into Ru&s;&s;ia by the Tartars of Yakut&s;ki, bordering on the ea&s;tern Tartars belonging to China. They travel through Siberia to Samura, thence to Ca&s;an, and la&s;tly to Mo&s;cow. The revenue of A&s;tracan is computed at one hundred and fifty thou&s;and rubles, or thirty-three thou&s;and pounds, ari&s;ing chiefly from &s;alt and fi&s;h. The city is ruled by a governor, under the check of a chancery. He
<PB N="372" REF="3870">
is neverthele&s;s arbitrary enough, and exerci&s;es oppre&s;&s;ion with impunity. The officers of the admiralty and cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, having very &s;mall &s;a|laries, are open to corruption, and extremely ra|pacious. At chri&s;tening-fea&s;ts, which are attended with great intemperance, the gue&s;ts drink a kind of cherry-brandy out of large goblets, and every per&s;on invited throws a pre&s;ent of money into the bed of the mother, who &s;its up with great forma|lity to be &s;aluted by the company.</P>
<P>The Indians have a pagan temple at A&s;tracan, in which they pay their adoration, and make offerings of fruit to a very ugly deformed idol. The prie&s;ts of this pagod u&s;e incen&s;e, beads, cups, and pro&s;trations. The Tartars, on the contrary, hold image-wor&s;hip in the utmo&s;t abomination. In the neighbourhood of this city, there are &s;eve|ral &s;ettlements of the Crim Tartars, who pay tri|bute to the Ru&s;&s;ians. They are a civil, indu&s;trious people, who cultivate the ground, which pro|duces manna-&s;eed, oats, mu&s;k-melons, and water|melons: but their chief wealth con&s;i&s;ts in their daughters, &s;heep, hor&s;es, and cattle. When a Tartar's daughter becomes marriageable, her tent is covered with white linnen, and to the top is fixed a painted cloth tied with red &s;trings; at one &s;ide of the tent &s;tands a painted waggon, and the&s;e con&s;titute her marriage portion: in con&s;equence of this &s;ignal, the young men make their addre&s;&s;es to the father, who be&s;tows the maiden in marriage upon him who offers the mo&s;t valuable pre&s;ent. The&s;e Tartars are of the mu&s;&s;ulman religion, and &s;eem to be extremely nice in their burial-places. Their graves are dug very deep, lined with bricks, white-wa&s;hed, vaulted, and &s;urrounded with mud|walls, on the top of which they plant white flags, in honour of the decea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="3880">
Along the &s;ide of the Volga, between A&s;tracan and Yerkie, there are &s;ome &s;ettlements of the Khalmucks, who dwell in round tents, called Khabithus, rai&s;ed with canes in the form of a cone, and covered with willocks, which is a very thick felt made of camel's hair. Some of the&s;e tents are fifteen yards in circumference, and about twelve feet high. The fire is made in the centre, and the &s;moke i&s;&s;ues through a hole at the top. The&s;e people are wretchedly poor, and almo&s;t naked. They &s;ub&s;i&s;t on the fi&s;h they take in the Volga, through which they paddle in &s;mall canoes; for the governor of A&s;tracan deprived them of their large boats, in which they u&s;ed to rob and murder pa&s;&s;engers, and di&s;turb the peace of the govern|ment. They choo&s;e to live on the banks of the river, among the tall flags and ru&s;hes, which in &s;ome mea&s;ure protect them from the rigours of the winter. We &s;eldom &s;ee above &s;even or eight tents in one place; and the&s;e contain about thirty or forty per&s;ons, who live in di&s;tinct families, un|der the direction of one chief, elected as a ma|gi&s;trate. There are other tribes of the Khalmucks, who live a wandering life, like the antient Scy|thians, moving &s;outherly or northerly, according to the coldne&s;s or heat of the &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>The navigation of the Volga is a &s;ubject of &s;uch con&s;equence to the empire of Ru&s;&s;ia, that the reader will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to &s;ee &s;ome of its pe|culiarities de&s;cribed. We have already ob&s;erved, that this celebrated river, formerly known by the name of the Rha, takes its ri&s;e in the province of Re&s;koff, i&s;&s;uing from the lake Fernaff, and, in a cour&s;e of near three thou&s;and Engli&s;h miles, re|ceives a great number of con&s;iderable rivers, among which are the Twer&s;a from Twere, the Mo&s;ka from Mo&s;cow, the Occa from Kolumna, the Kuma, and the Samar. Thus enlarged by
<PB N="374" REF="3890">
tributary &s;treams, it runs with a maje&s;tic cour&s;e into the Ca&s;pian Sea. Tho&s;e tributary rivers being &s;welled by torrents from the mountains, when the &s;now melts in the &s;pring, mu&s;t of con&s;equence rai&s;e the waters of the Volga at this &s;ea&s;on. It accordingly begins to ri&s;e in March, increa&s;es in April and May, continues above its u&s;ual mark till the end of June, and then decrea&s;es apace. It is again &s;welled by the autumnal rains in Septem|ber; but this increa&s;e is neither &s;o great, nor &s;o regular. At A&s;tracan, the ri&s;e u&s;ually amounts to &s;even or eight feet, unle&s;s it be augmented by the &s;outherly wind blowing the water up the Ca&s;pian Sea. At Zazitzen, which &s;tands four hundred wer&s;ts above A&s;tracan, the &s;tream ri&s;es to twenty feet; and much higher at Ca&s;an, which is twelve hundred wer&s;ts nearer the &s;ource of the river. The ice breaks up at different times in dif|ferent parts of the river, according to the climates through which it runs. At A&s;tracan, the thaw begins about the end of February; but the fro&s;t continues a month longer at Ca&s;an. The channel is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, altered every year by the force of the current, and the &s;ands which are blown into it from the adjacent country. The &s;tream, in its common cour&s;e, runs at the rate of a mile an hour; but, in time of floods, it flows with three times that velocity. For large ve&s;&s;els the navigation is difficult, except when the river is &s;welled: at the&s;e &s;ea&s;ons it floats ve&s;&s;els of &s;ix hundred tons <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The &s;ailors on this river are &s;o expert in warping, that they will, in one day, warp a ve&s;&s;el thirty miles again&s;t the &s;tream.</NOTE>. The trade of the Volga is very great and exten&s;ive, e&s;pecially from Yan&s;law and Ca&s;an. Be&s;ides the great quantity of fi&s;h taken in the river, and exported to all parts of the em|pire, the caviare alone con&s;titutes a con&s;iderable article of commerce. It is made (as we have &s;aid
<PB N="375" REF="3900">
above) of the roes of &s;turgeon and belluga, and the Ru&s;&s;ians call it Jecra. The fibrous parts being taken away, they are mixed with a kind of puri|fied &s;alt brine, then drained from the oily parts, and pre&s;&s;ed into a con&s;i&s;tence, which may be pre|&s;erved for two or three years. The grain is of a darki&s;h grey colour, almo&s;t as big as a pepper|corn, and when cut, appears tran&s;parent. In the winter it is conveyed fre&s;h to all parts of the em|pire, being greatly e&s;teemed as a tooth&s;ome re&s;to|rative. A large quantity is exported to Italy, and con&s;umed by the Chri&s;tians of the Levant. The be&s;t method of preparing it, is practi&s;ed by the Armenians, who have been known to bring above three hundred tons in one year to market.</P>
<P>The &s;econd town in the province of A&s;tracan is Saratow, or Saratof, &s;ituated on a branch of the Volga, on a ri&s;ing ground, from whence the &s;ub|urbs extend them&s;elves along the &s;ide of the river. Though this place is &s;tiled a fortre&s;s, the upper part of the town has no other fortifications than wooden towers; but it is always &s;ecured by a &s;trong garri&s;on, to &s;uppre&s;s the incur&s;ions of the Khalmuck Tartars, a &s;avage and rapacious race, who&s;e territory begins in the neighbourhood of this city. The country around Saratof is open and fertile; and at one of the gates is the begin|ning of a beaten highway, which runs as far as Mo&s;cow. The town is beautified by a good num|ber of wooden churches; but the hou&s;es are ge|nerally mean and inconvenient. The inhabitants are all Ru&s;&s;ians, and the greater part &s;oldiers, un|der the command of the governor. The city has &s;uffered greatly from conflagrations: but the greate&s;t misfortune is its being &s;ubject to the in|cur&s;ions of the Tartars, whom the Mu&s;covites have driven from this province towards the &s;hore of the Ca&s;pian Sea, and the river Jaick. The&s;e are,
<PB N="376" REF="3910">
properly &s;peaking, either out-laws, or va&s;&s;als who $ave de&s;erted from their ma&s;ters. Their fortune being de&s;perate, they turn robbers and pirates, and commonly herd in gangs of thirty and forty. They procure row-boats that will hold twenty or thirty men, provided with fire-arms, and, board|ing the ve&s;&s;els on the Volga, ma&s;&s;acre the pa&s;|&s;engers, and plunder their effects. The Arme|nians are generally intrepid, and fight bravely in defence of their property: but the bourlacks, or Ru&s;&s;ian water-men, are &s;eized with a pannic at the fir&s;t appearance of tho&s;e barbarians, who, they imagine, are rendered invincible by compact with the devil. Detachments of &s;oldiers are often &s;ent in que&s;t of tho&s;e ruffians, and a very &s;evere pu|ni&s;hment is inflicted upon them, if they be taken. A gibbet is erected on a float, and furni&s;hed with hooks, according to the number of the malefactors, who are &s;tripped and fa&s;tened to them alive by the ribs: then the float is launched into the &s;tream; and the inhabitants of the towns and villages on the banks of the river are forbid, on pain of death, to give them any &s;u&s;tenance or relief. They &s;ometimes live four or five days in this mi|&s;erable &s;ituation, howling and bla&s;pheming in a delirium produced by the pain, and between whiles imploring a draught of water, with the mo&s;t piteous lamentation. If any of their confe|derates find them in this condition, and think there is a probability of their recovering, they take them down, and relieve them at the ri&s;que of their own lives: but if they perceive them in extremity, they di&s;patch them in&s;tantly with their fire-arms. One of the&s;e mi&s;creants having di&s;en|gaged him&s;elf from the hook, &s;wam a&s;hore, half dead with lo&s;s of blood, cold, and famine.

In the neighbour|hood of this fortre&s;s may be &s;een the trench or canal between the rivers Laola and Cami&s;hinka, by means of which the czar Peter propo&s;ed to open a communication between the Don and the Volga. The di&s;tance between the neare&s;t parts of the two great rivers did not exceed an hun|dred miles: but that between the &s;mall river Laola, which falls into the Don, and the Cami&s;hinka, which runs into the Volga, was not much above three miles: &s;luices were to be placed on the&s;e &s;mall rivers, in order to render them navigable, and a canal of communication was to be cut from the one to the other. Upon this work, about fif|teen thou&s;and men were employed three &s;ummers &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, under the direction of captain Perry; and one half of the canal was actually made, when the work was interrupted in con&s;equence of the battle of Narva, in which the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;u&s;tained a terrible defeat, and on account of other pre&s;&s;ing emergencies. Perry was afterwards employed at Veronize, in rai&s;ing the river by means of &s;luices, &s;o as to place the Czar's &s;hips of war upon dry blocks, above the ordinary &s;urface of the water. This work he performed to the &s;atisfaction of the Czar; but had the misfortune to incur the re&s;ent|ment of &s;ome mini&s;ters, and was very ill rewarded for his &s;ervices. The country between Cami|&s;hinka and Terki is the mo&s;t plea&s;ant and fertile, and enjoys one of the be&s;t climates in the world. The &s;now does not lie above three months on the ground; and immediately after it vani&s;hes, the warm weather &s;ucceeds: then the ground is im|mediately covered with tulips, ro&s;es, lillies of the
<PB N="378" REF="3930">
valley, pinks, &s;weet-williams, and other fragrant flowers, and herbs in great variety, &s;o as to exhi|bit the appearance of a delicious garden. The very be&s;t a&s;paragus grows &s;o thick, that in &s;ome places it may be mowed down. The common gra&s;s in the meadows is &s;o high as to reach up to a hor&s;e's belly: the fields produce abundance of liquorice, almonds, and cherries; but the trees are low, and the fruit is &s;mall. Corn and other fruits of the earth ri&s;e and ripen almo&s;t without culti|vation. The woods and plains abound with fallow|deer, rein-deer, elks, wild boars, wild hor&s;es, and wild &s;heep. The wool of the&s;e is very &s;hort and coar&s;e; but the mutton is tender, delicate, and of a delicious flavour: the &s;kin of the wild hor&s;e is a thick warm fur, u&s;ed for the lining and cover of &s;leds and carriages. The long gra&s;s drying on the ground is &s;ometimes &s;et on fire by accident, in &s;pots where travellers halt for refre&s;hment; and &s;ometimes it is kindled on purpo&s;e, to produce ve|getable a&s;hes as a manure for the ground. Upon the&s;e occa&s;ions, it &s;preads with great rapidity through a va&s;t tract of country, &s;ometimes extend|ing thirty or forty miles in all different directions, rolling in a dark cloud by day, and in a blaze of flame reflected on the clouds by night: thus it continues with a &s;wift progre&s;s, until it is &s;topped by a river or a fore&s;t of tall trees. About forty wer&s;ts below Czaritza, we perceive the ruins of a large city, called Czaragorod, plea&s;antly &s;ituated. It is &s;aid to have been the re&s;idence of a Scythian king, and was de&s;troyed by Tamerlane. Lower &s;till on the &s;ide of the Volga &s;tands Tzornogorod, a &s;mall town &s;trongly fortified, and &s;ecured by a good Ru&s;&s;ian garri&s;on, to repre&s;s the incur&s;ions of the Khalmucks: it &s;tands upon an eminence, and is provided with watch-towers on all &s;ides, from whence they can de&s;cry the enemy at a di&s;tance.
<PB N="379" REF="3940">
The&s;e precautions are ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, to fru&s;|trate the de&s;igns of a people who carry on their &s;udden enterprizes with incredible expedition. They often make an irruption as far as Sumara, from whence they carry off the cattle, and every thing that falls in their way. Tzornogorod was built in con&s;equence of their having ma&s;&s;acred and plundered a caravan of Mu&s;covite merchants, who had unfortunately lingered behind their e&s;cort. The town was accordingly built about two miles lower than the place on which it now &s;tands; but being almo&s;t de&s;troyed by the overflowing of the Volga, the &s;ituation was changed.</P>
<P>The remaining provinces of Ru&s;&s;ia are generally termed A&s;iatic Mu&s;covy, though great part of them are confined within the limits of Europe. As they lie contiguous on the map to the coun|tries we have already de&s;cribed, and belong to the &s;ame &s;overeign, we &s;hall proceed to give an ac|count of them, as provinces belonging to the Ru&s;&s;ian empire. They are known by the names of Siberia, Samoiedia, Ru&s;&s;ian Tartary, Lapland, and Nova Zembla. The kingdom of Siberia is a va&s;t tract of land, &s;tretching eighteen degrees from north to &s;outh, beginning at the fiftieth, and extending to the &s;ixty-eighth degree of northern latitude. On the we&s;t, it is parted from Ru&s;&s;ia by the great chain of mountains reaching from Cauca&s;us to the Northern Ocean, or Frozen Sea, which bounds it on the north: to the ea&s;tward and &s;outhward, it is terminated by the Japanic ocean, and part of Great Tartary. The whole length of Siberia, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, amounts to nine hundred German leagues, its provinces &s;tretching even as far as the river Argun, which is within a few days journey of the famous wall of China: but the breadth from north to &s;outh does not exceed four hundred German leagues.
<PB N="380" REF="3950">
This country is thinly inhabited by people of the Tartarian race, &s;cattered in various tribes, and di|&s;tingui&s;hed by different appellations: but that of Siberia, be&s;towed upon it &s;ince it was conquered by the Ru&s;&s;ians, is derived from a Sclavonic word, &s;ignifying a pri&s;on, &s;o called, becau&s;e it is the place to which the Czar exiles tho&s;e who incur his di&s;|plea&s;ure. State-pri&s;oners are &s;ent hither, either for their whole lives, or for a certain term of years, according to the nature of their crimes, or rather the re&s;entment and caprice of their &s;overeign. Some are indulged with a very &s;mall allowance for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence; others are left to live upon pur|cha&s;e; but all of them are obliged to bring in a weekly tribute of furs to the Czar, otherwi&s;e they are &s;everely puni&s;hed by their ta&s;k-ma&s;ters. Thus circum&s;tanced, they often lie in the open fields, amid&s;t all the rigours of the mo&s;t &s;evere winter; and they find it nece&s;&s;ary to learn the utmo&s;t dex|terity in &s;hooting the wild bea&s;ts in the head with a &s;ingle ball: for, &s;hould the furs be pierced with &s;hot-holes, or &s;tained with blood, the delinquent will be puni&s;hed with great cruelty. The country of Siberia is wild, de&s;olate, inten&s;ely cold, barren, and poorly inhabited; roughened with huge mountains and impenetrable fore&s;ts, and abound|ing with frozen lakes, fens, and mora&s;&s;es: yet, even amid&s;t the&s;e dreary wa&s;tes, &s;ome beautiful plantations have been made by the art and in|du&s;try of the unhappy exiles, bani&s;hed to this remote and inho&s;pitable corner of the earth. Siberia was di&s;covered and conquered by the Ru&s;&s;ians, in the reign of Iwan Ba&s;ilowitz. A notorious robber, called Temefoiewitz, obtained his pardon by the interce&s;&s;ion of one Straginaff, a man of great opulence, on condition that he &s;hould reduce Siberia to the Czar's &s;ubjection. He forthwith a&s;&s;embled his companions, the ban|ditti,

with whom he had a&s;&s;ociated, and being &s;up|plied with arms, boats, and other nece&s;&s;aries, by Straginaff, &s;et out upon this expedition. After having pa&s;&s;ed many rivers, and performed fa|tiguing marches through a cold and de&s;art coun|try, he arrived at the fortre&s;s of Tumeen, &s;ituated on the river Toru, about the forty-fifth degree of latitude. Having made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of this confine, he proceeded up the river by water as far as the city of Tobol&s;ki, which he likewi&s;e re|duced. This adventurer being accidentally drown|ed in the &s;equel, the Czar &s;ent thither a &s;trong army, which fini&s;hed the conque&s;t of the whole country. Ever &s;ince that period, Siberia has been tributary to the Ru&s;&s;ian empire, and governed by a waiwode, or vice-roy. Tobol&s;ki, the capital, is &s;ituated at the confluence of the Tobol and Ir|ti&s;k, in the latitude of fifty-eight. The city &s;tands upon the a&s;cent of a high hill, the lower part of which is inhabited by Mahometan Tartars, who carry on a con&s;iderable traffick up the river Irti&s;k, and convey their merchandize quite acro&s;s Great Tartary, as far as China. The river Irti&s;k is reckoned as rapid as the Danube; runs from the &s;outh, and empties it&s;elf into the Oby: the Tobol wa&s;hes the other &s;ide of the town, and a little be|low it, falls into the Irti&s;k. By means of the&s;e two rivers, there is a con&s;tant flow of merchandize into the city during the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on. Tobol&s;ki is therefore a great mart for the commodities of Mu&s;covy, Tartary, and other countries; and here is a great concour&s;e of merchants. All &s;orts of provi&s;ion are plentiful and cheap. An hundred weight of rice is &s;old for &s;ixteen copecs, equal to about eight-pence &s;terling; a &s;turgeon, weighing forty pounds, for half that money; an ox for two rix-dollars, and every other article in pro|portion: the adjacent country abounds with game

in great variety. The &s;upreme court of judicature for all Siberia is held in this city, which is al&s;o the &s;eat of a metropolitan, &s;ent hither from Mo&s;|cow to exerci&s;e &s;piritual juri&s;diction over the whole kingdom. Tobol&s;ki is well fortified, and defended by a &s;trong garri&s;on, under the com|mand of the waiwode, who re&s;ides in the place, and takes charge of the fur tribute, which is here depo&s;ited in proper magazines. This governor enjoys a very exten&s;ive command, and can occa|&s;ionally bring into the field nine thou&s;and men, be&s;ides a &s;trong body of Tartars on hor&s;eback, to make head again&s;t the Khalmucks and Co&s;&s;acks, in their repeated incur&s;ions. A &s;ufficient number of Ru&s;&s;ians, called Jem&s;koiks, are kept in conti|nual pay by the government, on the banks of the Irti&s;k, to &s;upply travellers on the Czar's account with men, boats, or carriages, to convey them as far as Surgut on the Oby, a voyage of two hun|dred leagues by water. This is the common me|thod of travelling in the &s;ummer; but in winter the journey by land is not half &s;o long, being per|formed in &s;leds over the ice and &s;now, with which the country is covered. The&s;e &s;leds are moved by a pair of dogs, which will draw a load of three hundred pounds with &s;urpri&s;ing expedition. They are hired at ea&s;y rates, and during one half of the year, may be &s;een flying over the &s;now in great numbers.</P>
<P>On the river Irti&s;k, about fifty leagues north of Tobol&s;ki, is the town of Demian&s;koi, a place of con&s;iderable traffick, and well fortified in the Ru&s;&s;ian manner. On the &s;ame river, about twen|ty leagues above its confluence with the Oby, &s;tands the town of Somaro&s;koi-jam. There was another place in this neighbourhood, called Ol&s;|coygorod; but it was de&s;troyed by order of the governor of Siberia, for what rea&s;on we cannot

declare. They have built, however, another town, called Zergolt, about fifty leagues below Ol&s;coy|gorod, in a &s;ort of an i&s;land formed by the Oby. About fifteen days journey northward from To|bol&s;ki, near the confines of Petzora, &s;tands the fortre&s;s of Pohem, on the &s;ide of a river that runs into the Tobol. Here is likewi&s;e a town inhabited by Mu&s;covites, &s;ent hither from &s;everal parts of Siberia, to make a con&s;iderable &s;ettlement, on account of the fertility of the &s;oil, and of the woods, which are &s;tocked with a variety of wild bea&s;ts; &s;uch as foxes, &s;ables, wolves, and leopards, that yield valuable furs. Tumeen, &s;ituated on the river Tora, in the fifty-fifth degree of latitude, is a &s;trong and populous city, chiefly inhabited by Ru&s;&s;ians. The country around it is fertile and well cultivated, well &s;haded with woods, and in|ter&s;per&s;ed with a great number of villages. The&s;e fore&s;ts produce red foxes, wolves, bears, and the choice&s;t grey &s;quirrels of the whole Ru&s;&s;ian em|pire. They are not &s;old to the merchants, but wholly &s;et apart for the u&s;e of the Czarina. Ja|panzin &s;tands on the &s;ame river, about five-and-forty leagues to the north-we&s;t of Tumeen; built in the latter end of the &s;ixteenth century, as a &s;tage or halting place for travellers. Here the Czarina maintains a numerous garri&s;on, under the command of a governor, who di&s;tributes from hence corn and other provi&s;ions to tho&s;e garri|&s;ons and fortre&s;&s;es that are &s;ituated in de&s;art, un|cultivated countries. Tora is a place of con&s;ide|rable trade, built by the Mu&s;covites on the river Irti&s;k, about forty-&s;ix leagues to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Tobol&s;ki. Surgut, &s;ituated on the river Oby, is a paultry town, wretchedly built, and thinly in|habited by people &s;o indigent, that they can hardly procure cloaths to defend them from the &s;everity of the weather. The inhabitants of the adjacent
<PB N="384" REF="4020">
territory are &s;till more mi&s;erable. They are very little acquainted with agriculture; but $Span$ hunting &s;ables, ermines, black foxes $Span$ and hyenas. The ermines of this di&s;trict $Word$ counted the be&s;t in all Siberia: the &s;kin of a black fox will &s;ell for two or three hundred rubles: the hyena is a fierce rapacious animal, that will lurk among the boughs of a tree, and dart it&s;elf occa|&s;ionally at a hart, elk, or rein-deer; on the back of which it will fa&s;ten it&s;elf by its claws and teeth, and there continue until the animal drops down, either with the lo&s;s of blood, or the fatigue of running: the beavers are well known for their &s;a|gacity and ingenuity in cutting timber, and build|ing habitations of different &s;tories. If we may be|lieve the Siberians, one nation of the&s;e animals declare war again&s;t another, and the victors en|&s;lave the vanqui&s;hed, compelling them to labour hard for their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In the latitude of 58&deg;&deg; 50&prime;, about an hundred and ten leagues to the ea&s;t|ward of Tobol&s;ki, &s;tands Narim, capital of a ter|ritory that bears the &s;ame name, a large and po|pulous town, &s;ituated on the Oby, &s;ecured by a &s;trong fortre&s;s, and defended by a &s;trong garri&s;on of Co&s;&s;acks. The woods in this di&s;trict yield plenty of furs; but the country is cold, barren, and very thinly inhabited by the O&s;tiacks, a bru|tal, ignorant, and &s;lothful people. They wor&s;hip deformed wooden idols of very rude workman|&s;hip. They cloath them&s;elves in the &s;kins of &s;tur|geon, with which this river abounds. They are &s;ubject to certain chiefs, by them &s;tiled Kne&s;cas, who collect the tribute which is yearly paid to the Empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia. Among other articles, they are &s;aid to pay a certain quantity of gold, which is gathered on the &s;ides of rivers after torrents. They live in wretched huts, which are partly under-ground; but they have no con&s;iderable
<PB N="385" REF="4030">
towns or villages. Thirty leagues to the &s;outh|ward of Narim &s;tands Tom&s;koi, a &s;trong frontier town, and capital of a province, &s;ituated on the river Tora, near the place where it falls into the Oby. Be&s;ides the&s;e cities, which we have de|&s;cribed, there are &s;everal other towns and fortre&s;&s;es built on the confines and rivers of this kingdom. In the pre&s;ent century, a certain number of Sibe|rians, being &s;ent upon di&s;coveries, travelled ea&s;t|ward in &s;ledges through wa&s;te and de&s;art tracts, in which, however, they found abundance of trees, plants, and rivers; and, at the end of three weeks, arrived in a level champain country, inhabited by a &s;avage people, who called them|&s;elves Tingoe&s;i. Their language was hardly arti|culate, but &s;o guttural, that it re&s;embled the gabbling of a turkey-cock. They dwell in huts along the great river Jeni&s;cea, which takes its ri&s;e from the lake Bagkal, and, running northward five-and-twenty degrees, di&s;&s;embogues it&s;elf into the Northern Ocean. In &s;ummer it overflows the flat country, like the Nile, to the extent of &s;eventy leagues. Whenever it begins to &s;well, the Tin|goe&s;e remove, with all their cattle and effects, to the mountains, where they remain till the inun|dation &s;ub&s;ides: then they return to the place of their former re&s;idence, and feed their flocks on the rich pa&s;ture produced by the &s;lime which the river has left upon the lands. In the year after this excur&s;ion, a company of Mu&s;covites, attend|ed by &s;ome Samoiedes and Tingoe&s;e, as their guides and interpreters, took the &s;ame route to the ea&s;tward, and proceeded as far as the river Pe&s;ida, which is not quite &s;o large, but as rapid as the Jeni&s;cea. On the hither banks of this Pe&s;ida, they found a race of &s;avage people, brawny and robu&s;t, with great heads and little eyes. They gave the Ru&s;&s;ians to under&s;tand by &s;igns, that on
<PB N="386" REF="4040">
the other &s;ide of the river, they frequently heard the &s;ound of bells, which they expre&s;&s;ed by re|peating om, om. The curio&s;ity of the waiwode of Siberia being excited by the report of the&s;e tra|vellers, he, in the following year, detached &s;e|ven hundred men to pro&s;ecute the di&s;covery. They encamped on the banks of the Pe&s;ida, in order to wait the return of &s;pring; and confirmed the truth of the former reports. When the wind &s;et towards them, they could di&s;tinctly hear the &s;ound of bells, and even the noi&s;e of hor&s;es tra|velling on the other &s;ide of the river. They like|wi&s;e fancied they &s;aw ve&s;&s;eis with &s;quare &s;ails, &s;uch as are common in India. In the month of April, the ice began to thaw, and in a little time the country was covered with a variety of flowers, fruits, and verdure: bea&s;ts of different kinds ap|peared in the fields, and the birds began to warble in every grove. The&s;e agreeable circum&s;tances, one would imagine, &s;hould have induced them to cro&s;s the river, and pur&s;ue their de&s;ign: but, like true Mu&s;covites, they returned by &s;low marches, and arrived, in the autumn, at Tobol&s;ki. The river Pe&s;ida is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the boundary of Cathai on that &s;ide; and the court of Ru&s;&s;ia &s;till re&s;olved to make further di&s;coveries. The go|vernor of Siberia &s;ent thither another caravan by land, and a good number of &s;eamen, in covered ve&s;&s;els, down the river Oby into the Northern Sea, that they might &s;urvey the coa&s;ts of it as far as the mouth of the Jeni&s;cea. He gave them in|&s;tructions, importing, that the fir&s;t who arrived at this mouth, whether by land or water, &s;hould wait a whole year for the others, and then return by the different routes they had followed. The en|terprize was atchieved by both companies, who &s;ent their &s;everal journals &s;ealed to the court of Mo&s;cow, where, however, they &s;eem to have met
<PB N="387" REF="4050">
with little or no regard, ina&s;much as no u&s;e has been made of their di&s;coveries. The indolence of the Ru&s;&s;ians, with re&s;pect to di&s;coveries in this quarter, is the le&s;s excu&s;able, as they may be conveyed through the greater part of this va&s;t tract of land by means of navigable rivers.</P>

<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e is the Jeni&s;cea, which takes its ri&s;e from &s;ome lakes near a ridge of high mountains, in the &s;outhern part of Siberia, and running towards the north-we&s;t, traver&s;es the land of Kurge&s;&s;es: by this time it is become con&s;iderable by the addition of many brooks and rivers, particularly by the Angura, which i&s;&s;uing from the lake Baykal, waters the city of Jeni&s;cea, or Jeni&s;koi; and by the Pedkamena and Ton|gu&s;ca: thus &s;welled, it enters Samoiedia, where it receives many other &s;treams, and, among the re&s;t, the river Nizaia Tongu&s;ca, which runs through the territories of the Tongu&s;ci, famous for the mona&s;tery of Troit&s;iogo, and the town of Tur|gan&s;coi. The Jeni&s;cea is afterwards augmented by the Schoriga, Core&s;iga, Gataka, Ubo, and the Gu&s;ina, two branches of which form the i&s;land of that name. The Jeni&s;cea, being inlarged by all the&s;e bodies of water, winds along the ea&s;tern &s;ide of the great ridge of mountains; then dividing it&s;elf, falls into the Frozen Sea, forming an i&s;land oppo&s;ite to Nova Zembla. Between the Ni&s;naia Tongu&s;ca, and the Godkama Zongu&s;ca, there are &s;ome volcanoes, that have been known to di&s;charge &s;moke and flame, even in this climate, bound by eternal fro&s;t. On the banks of this great river, near the confines of the O&s;tiacks and Tongu&s;i, is &s;ituated the town of Jeni&s;cea, a large, &s;trong, and populous place, well &s;upplied with fle&s;h, fowl, game, fi&s;h, corn, millet, rue and
<PB N="388" REF="4060">
other grain. The&s;e productions, however, the inhabitants mu&s;t import from other countries; for the climate is &s;o inten&s;ely cold, that &s;carce any thing can be brought to maturity. The common fruit-trees bear nothing but leaves, nor do we find any thing produced &s;pontaneou&s;ly in this territory, except &s;ome goo&s;eberries and &s;trawberries. This city of Jeni&s;cea, or Jeni&s;koi, is the capital of the province of Dauria, bordering on the ea&s;tern part of Tartary, and conquered by the Mu&s;covites: it is now &s;ubjected to the wai|wode, or governor of Siberia, and counted part of that kingdom. Along the banks of the river, as well as in the adjacent meadows, the inhabitants dig out of the ground a kind of ivory, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the teeth of the behemoth, which &s;ome au|thors have repre&s;ented as an animal that lives under-ground, without being able to bear the light of day: but this de&s;cription does not at all &s;uit the character of the hippotamos, which is often &s;een in the rivers of Africa, particularly in the upper parts of the Gambia and Niger.</P>

<P>Siberia is peopled by three different nations, namely, the Ru&s;&s;ians &s;ent hither from Mu&s;covy, either as officers, &s;oldiers, planters, or exiles; the native Siberians, and colonies of Tartars: indeed Siberia was originally peopled from Tar|tary, or the ancient Scythia. The Tongu&s;ci, or proper inhabitants of Siberia, are divided into four tribes; the Podkamena Tongou&s;i, who live be|tween the rivers Jeni&s;cea and Lena; the Sabatzki Tongou&s;i, who inhabit the country lying between the Lena and the bay of Kamtzechatka, to the northward of the river Aldan; the Oleuni Ton|gou&s;i, who live near the &s;ources of the Lena and
<PB N="389" REF="4070">
the Aldan, to the northward of the Amur; and the Conni Tongou&s;i, &s;eated between the lake Bag|kal, and the city of Nerzen&s;koi, along the river Amur. The&s;e four tribes &s;till retain, in their cu&s;toms and phy&s;iognomy, evident marks of their Tartarian extract; though they are not &s;o &s;quat, flat no&s;ed, and ugly as the Khalmucks; on the contrary, they are tall, &s;tout, and active beyond all the Siberian Tartars. The tribes of Podka|mena and Sabatzki differ very little in their way of living from their ea&s;tern and we&s;tern neigh|bours, the O&s;tiacks and Samoiedes, except in this particular; in &s;ummer, both men and women ap|pear without any other covering than a leathern girdle about the middle, intended not &s;o much for decency, as in order to &s;creen tho&s;e tender parts from the &s;tings of in&s;ects generated in the lakes and mar&s;hes, &s;o as to &s;warm in every part of this country, during the hot weather. In the winter, they are clad like their neighbours, in the &s;kins of rein-deer, with the hair outwards, the &s;hoes, &s;tockings, and breeches being all formed of one piece. The head is covered with a cap of &s;ome other fur, variou&s;ly fa&s;hioned, according to the ta&s;te or fancy of the wearer. In &s;ummer, they &s;ub&s;i&s;t on fi&s;h; and in winter, on the game they kill: but they have not &s;agacity enough to breed cattle; nor do they u&s;e any animal but rein-deer and dogs. Per&s;ons of di&s;tinction are known by a number of black &s;ports, with which they &s;tain the &s;kin of their faces and hands, by way of orna|ment. Their dead they hang upon trees, until the fle&s;h rots off, and then they inter the &s;kele|ton. The Oleuni Tongou&s;i are not quite &s;o bar|barous and bruti&s;h as the other tribes: they breed cattle, u&s;e the milk, and fea&s;t upon them occa|&s;ionally; yet their method of admini&s;tering an oath is altogether bea&s;tly.

Part of the country inhabited by this tribe is under the Chine&s;e dominion; but all the re&s;t be|longs to Mu&s;covy, and the natives are obliged annually to &s;end a tribute of furs to the grand magazine of Siberia. The chief weapon they u&s;e in war is the hatchet, though, of late years, they have imported a kind of broad-&s;word, or cutla&s;s, from their neighbours of Mu&s;covy. The&s;e are worn by both &s;exes, which are trained alike to the exerci&s;e of arms. Both men and women are courageous, nimble, active, manage their wea|pons and ride with uncommon dexterity; yet they are naturally pacific, and the different tribes live amicably with one another. They dwell in moveable huts, which they can &s;hift occa&s;ionally; either for plea&s;ure or convenience. In the &s;ummer, they travel along the lakes and rivers in canoes; and in winter, on &s;ledges drawn by dogs or rein|deer. Polygamy obtains among the&s;e people, to the mo&s;t unbounded extent; and the hu&s;band is &s;o ab&s;olute, that he can &s;ell, barter, or exchange his wives at plea&s;ure.</P>

<P>The Siberian &s;avages acknowledge a Supreme Being; but all their adoration is paid to wooden images of their own carving, rudely notched with knives, and as deformed as imagination can re|pre&s;ent. In all probability, the de&s;ign of tho&s;e who invented &s;uch idols, was to in&s;pire fear and terror, which are the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions that influ|ence and agitate the human mird.

<HEAD>PRODUCE and COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The country of Siberia lies in general unculti|vated, and not a &s;talk of corn is to be &s;een. In|&s;tead of bread, the inhabitants u&s;e onions boiled up into a kind of pap or pudding, with a meal made of the roots of yellow lillies, dried and pounded. Va&s;t quantities of fi&s;h are caught in their lakes and rivers, particularly &s;almon, &s;tur|geon, and bellugas: the&s;e la&s;t are frequently found twelve and fifteen feet long; the fle&s;h is as white as veal, and extremely delicate. When the &s;now begins to melt, and increa&s;e the rapidity of the rivers, the &s;turgeons are &s;aid to &s;wallow a con&s;ider|able quantity of &s;tones, to ballance their bodies again&s;t the violence of the current, which &s;tones they throw up as &s;oon as the floods are abated. The be&s;t iron in Mu&s;covy is produced from the mines and forges of Siberia; but the great re|venue of this province ari&s;es from the article of furs, which amounts to an immen&s;e value. Among the productions of Siberia, we likewi&s;e enumerate the ivory manufactured from the teeth of the animal, which we have de&s;crib|ed above, under the denomination of behemoth. The great caravan, between Mo&s;cow and China, pa&s;&s;es through this province, the merchants of which barter the&s;e furs, together with commodities brought from Archangel, for the merchandize of China, &s;uch as tea, &s;ilks, and a kind of &s;tuff made of linnen and cotton, much worn by the Ru&s;&s;ian women. Another advantage, which the Ru&s;&s;ian emperor derives from the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Siberia, is a con&s;tant &s;upply of recruits for his army, from the large and numerous garri&s;ons of this country, con&s;idered as nur&s;eries for the mo&s;t hardy and intrepid &s;oldiers of the Mu&s;covite empire.

<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their MANNERS and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>The people who inhabit this dreary wa&s;te, are known by the denomination of <HI>Samoiedes,</HI> which is a Ru&s;&s;ian epithet, &s;ignifying <HI>man-eaters,</HI> though very unju&s;tly applied to the&s;e poor, mi&s;erable &s;a|vages. They re&s;emble the Laplanders in their lowne&s;s of &s;tature, their broad flat faces, &s;mall eyes, and large heads: their complexion is of a dark, grea&s;y, olive hue; their features, both in men and women, are coar&s;e, and their limbs ill turned; &s;o that on the whole they exhibit a very di&s;agreeable appearance. Their hair is black, thick and woolly: that of the women is plaited on each &s;ide of the face, and ornamented with bra&s;s trin|kets. The head, in both &s;exes, is covered with a fur cap, white on the in&s;ide, and black without. They are clad from head to foot in deer &s;kins with the hair outwards in &s;ummer, and inwards in win|ter; and their finery con&s;i&s;ts in &s;lips of red, yel|low, and blue cloth &s;ewed upon the&s;e garments. The men wear breeches and &s;tockings of one piece: the women have &s;hort petticoats of fur, reaching half way down the leg, which is covered with a kind of bu&s;kin of the &s;ame &s;kin: in winter, both men and women u&s;e a kind of long &s;kates, with which they glide over the &s;now and ice with &s;ur|pri&s;ing
<PB N="394" REF="4120">
ea&s;e and expedition. Their con&s;titutions are hardened by the &s;everity of the climate. They are &s;trong, active, and &s;o laborious, that they very often work them&s;elves into a pro&s;u&s;e &s;weat, in &s;pite of the inten&s;e cold; in that ca&s;e they wipe them&s;elves with an handful of the thin &s;havings of fir, which they carry about with them for this purpo&s;e, as well as to perform the other offices of an handkerchief. The&s;e poor &s;avages feed upon raw fle&s;h, guts, garbage, and even &s;tinking carrion, and are na&s;ty beyond all concep|tion. They eat dried fi&s;h in&s;tead of bread; and the wild bea&s;ts which they kill in hunting &s;upply them with meat for immediate u&s;e, as well as with winter &s;tore. No town or village is to be &s;een in this de&s;olate province: the people dwell in tents or caverns. During the &s;ummer they wander from place to place, for the conveniency of pa&s;ture to their rein-deer, or in que&s;t of their game which they kill with arrows. They are counted excel|lent archers, as being trained up to the exerci&s;e of the bow from their infancy. In a word, they bear a &s;trong affinity to the Laplanders in their per|&s;ons, their education, and their way of living; but are, if po&s;&s;ible, more ignorant and brutal. Their country too re&s;embles Lapland, whether we con&s;i|der its climate, &s;oil, appearance or productions. The Samoiedes travel like the Laplanders in &s;ledges drawn by rein-deer, which draw with &s;uch vigour and activity, that a man may travel in this manner above two hundred miles in one day. In the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, which la&s;ts about three months, they lodge in occa&s;ional tents made of the green &s;kins of the bea&s;ts they kill, and the&s;e, for want of dre&s;&s;ing, &s;tink abominably. At the approach of winter they retire to their holes or caverns, dug under the &s;urface of the earth, and covered with a conical roof made of boughs or fi&s;h bones &s;ecured
<PB N="395" REF="4130">
by thongs, and lined with the &s;kins of rein-deer. In this &s;ort of habitation the Samoiedes &s;hut them|&s;elves up for the winter, amid&s;t the &s;tench of their provi&s;ion, and the &s;moke of the fuel which they burn. This has no other vent but a hole at the top, which, when their wood is burnt to a coal, they &s;top with a cake of ice; this tran&s;mits a faint glimmering of light: when they have occa&s;ion to &s;ee more di&s;tinctly, they light a lamp, which they feed with fi&s;h oil, that diffu&s;es a mo&s;t abominable odour. It is not ea&s;y to conceive a &s;ituation more wretched than that of the&s;e unhappy people, half &s;tarved with cold, half &s;tifled with the &s;moke of green wood, half &s;uffocated with &s;tench, and half dead with hunger; for their whole winter food con&s;i&s;ts of a little dried fi&s;h, and &s;canty meals of the veni&s;on they kill and pre&s;erve in the &s;ummer, by hanging it up in the wind: yet the&s;e people, mi&s;erable as they may &s;eem to be, are not without their enjoyments. Their families maintain a &s;o|cial intercour&s;e one with another, even in the win|ter, by means of trenches drawn between the tents or caverns, which trenches are covered and vault|ed with ice and &s;now in &s;uch a manner as to form a kind of &s;ubterranean gallery, &s;ecurely defended from the rigour of the external air. They are even &s;o infatuated as to believe their country is the earthly paradi&s;e, and their climate the mo&s;t agree|able in the world. Two of their deputies that were &s;ent to the court of Mo&s;cow &s;crupled not to declare, that if the Czar knew the charms of their country, he would certainly fix his re&s;idence in Samoiedia. They beheld the pomp and magni|ficence of the Ru&s;&s;ian court with &s;urprize and ad|miration; but they preferred their own way of living to all the luxury of the court, and longed impatiently to revi&s;it their own &s;tinking habitati|ons. The Samoiedes lived formerly in obedience
<PB N="396" REF="4140">
to certain chiefs, who exerci&s;ed a &s;ort of patriar|chal authority over them, and received a tribute from every family. This kind of police &s;till re|mains in force among them, though they own them&s;elves &s;ubjects to the empire of Ru&s;&s;ia, and pay a yearly tax of furs to the emperor. They may likewi&s;e appeal for ju&s;tice and protection to the Mu&s;covite waiwode and officers appointed for that purpo&s;e. A man who is inclined to marry, purcha&s;es the bride of her parents for three or four rein-deer, which are counted equal in value to the be&s;t lady in Samoiedia. He can purcha&s;e as many wives as he chu&s;es to maintain, and repu|diate them at will, without any ceremony. When per&s;ons grow old and u&s;ele&s;s to the community, they are relea&s;ed from the mi&s;eries of life, by be|ing drowned or di&s;patched in &s;ome other manner, and their bones are pre&s;erved as reliques. When a &s;ucking infant dies, the parents &s;u&s;pend it on a tree, where it rots and putrefies by degrees: but children that die after being weaned, are interred.</P>

This whole country re&s;embles that of Swedi&s;h Lapland, which we have already de&s;cribed, and is inhabited by the very &s;ame people, from whom they differ in nothing but in the rites of the Greek church, which the Chri&s;tians of Mu&s;covite Lapland profe&s;s. In or|der the more ea&s;ily to govern, civilize, and fleece the&s;e people, the Czars have built towns in their

country, and &s;ent thither governors, prie&s;ts, and collectors, who admini&s;ter ju&s;tice, preach the Chri&s;|tian religion according to the rites of the Greek communion, and gather the yearly tribute or re|venue of furs. The&s;e towns, however, both in Lapland and Samoiedia, are no other than Mu&s;|coviti&s;h colonies, that &s;ub&s;i&s;t by traffick with the &s;avages, as well as with the merchants of different nations that vi&s;it the coa&s;t: accordingly all, or the greater part of their towns, are &s;ituated on the &s;ea|&s;ide.

Terr&s;koi Leporia, or the ea&s;tern part of Ru&s;&s;ian Lapland, is almo&s;t &s;ur|rounded with the &s;ea, and forms indeed the gulph of the White Sea.

Bel|lamoure&s;koi Leporia lies at the bottom of the White Sea, and is as cold, mountainous, and barren as the other parts of Lapland. The chief town is Soma, &s;tanding on the frontiers of Mu&s;coviti&s;h Ca|relia, and may be termed the key of Ru&s;&s;ian Lap|land on the White Sea.

Whether Nova Zembla be an i&s;land, or joined to the continent of Greenland on the we&s;t, or Tartary on the ea&s;t, is not yet deter|mined. This country was di&s;covered in the year 1553 by captain Hugh Willoughby, an Engli&s;h mariner, who was obliged, by &s;tre&s;s of weather, to

About three years after this unfortunate expedition, captain Bur|roughs of the &s;ame nation doubled the north cape, and di&s;covered the Streights of Weygatz, which hath &s;ince been vi&s;ited by &s;hips of different nations, that &s;ailed thither in hope of di&s;covering a north-ea&s;t pa&s;&s;age through the&s;e &s;treights into China.

The &s;hore is almo&s;t one con|tinued rock of ice, or rather mountains piled to a prodigious height, on one another, and huge float|ing fragments continually da&s;hing again&s;t their ba&s;e, which the &s;ea has undermined in many places, forming hideous cha&s;ms and caverns, effecting dreadful di&s;ruptions, and leaving prodigious ma&s;&s;es of rugged ice that &s;eem to hang in the air, and threaten in&s;tantaneous ruin.

The male wears an ax on his &s;houlder, a bow in his hand, and a quiver with arrows &s;lung at his back: the female wields a dart in her hand, appears with her long hair twi&s;ted, her chin and forehead painted with blue &s;treaks, and her ears and no&s;e loaded with jewels of blue &s;tones and fi&s;h-bone. The fi&s;herman is clad in a dre&s;s entirely compo&s;ed of &s;eal-&s;kin, the tails hang|ing dangling between his legs. His canoe is made of fi&s;h bones artfully joined, and neatly covered with $$ns &s;ewed together. It is entirely clo&s;e abo$e, except one hole about the middle, in which the owner &s;its &s;o as to fill up the whole cavity by means of a &s;kin laced about his body, that will not admit one drop of water. Thus equipped he will venture to &s;ea in very rough weather, and &s;hould be chance to be over&s;et, he can right him&s;elf imme|diately, the ballance between his body and the ca|noe is &s;o nicely adju&s;ted. By means of a paddle he makes his way through the water with incon|ceivable expedition: when he comes a&s;hore, he throws his b$at upon his &s;houlder, and, thus en|cumbered, can run with amazing &s;wiftne&s;s. The&s;e people have an aver&s;ion to &s;pirits and tobacco, which are &s;o acceptable to the Laplanders and Sa|moiedes. They live upon the bea&s;ts they kill in hunting, and the fi&s;h they catch along &s;hore: their drink is the &s;imple element; but they look upon train-oil as a dainty. They have no regular &s;y&s;tem of religion, but wor&s;hip the &s;un, moon, and &s;tars, together with certain wooden idols in human

&s;hape, rudely formed by the work of their own hands. The wooden work of their bows and darts is aukward and clum&s;y: their arrows are well fea|thered, and neatly armed with fi&s;h-bone, of which likewi&s;e they make their needles and other in&s;tru|ments. Yet from this country, inho&s;pitable as it may &s;eem to be, the Emperor of Mu&s;covy may derive great advantages, not only in the article of furs, which are always valuable in proportion to the coldne&s;s of the climate in which they are procured; but likewi&s;e in the fi&s;hery of the &s;ea|hor&s;e <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This animal, known by the name of Mor&s;e, is about the &s;ize of an ordinary hor&s;e, with large tu&s;ks, which are counted preferable to tho&s;e of the elephant.

<HEAD>THE ISLANDS OF SHETLAND and ORKNEY.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Their NUMBER and SITUATION.</HEAD>
<P>THAT we may leave no land behind us in the northern latitudes, we will now return to the Briti&s;h i&s;les, beginning with the mo&s;t northerly, which are tho&s;e of Shetland, or Zetland, lying from the 59th to the 61&s;t degree of latitude, in the mid-&s;eas, between Norway, Hud&s;on's Bay, and the north-coa&s;t of Scotland; the mo&s;t &s;outhern point of Shetland, called Swinburgh-Head, being at the di&s;tance of twenty leagues from Sunda, one of the mo&s;t northern i&s;les of Orkney. Shetland is compo&s;ed of about forty-&s;ix &s;eparate i&s;lands, be&s;ides about forty &s;maller holmes, and thirty barren rocks &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, and this clu&s;ter is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Thule of the antients, who placed here their Ely&s;ium, on account of the great length of their days in &s;ummer.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE.</HEAD>
<P>The air of the&s;e i&s;lands is keen, piercing, and &s;alutary, in&s;omuch that the people live to an un|common old age, and are very little &s;ubject to di&s;tempers. During the months of June and
<PB N="405" REF="4230">
July, they can &s;ee to read at midnight, and the air is generally &s;erene through the whole &s;ummer. This is their &s;ea&s;on both of plea&s;ure and emolu|ment; for their &s;ea is then covered with fi&s;hing|ve&s;&s;els, &s;ent from different nations, to catch her|rings, which &s;warm along the coa&s;t; and their towns are filled with a concour&s;e of foreigners, who drive a con&s;iderable traffic on &s;hore. To ballance the&s;e advantages, they undergo a winter of eight months, during which they are involved in darkne&s;s, &s;torms, and tempe&s;ts: not a &s;hip vi&s;its them in this dreary &s;ea&s;on: but they are cut off from all communication with other countries, from the month of October till May. The revo|lution of 1688, which happened in November, was not known in Shetland till the en&s;uing May, when that event was &s;ignified to them by a fi&s;her|man from Scotland. They were &s;o far from be|lieving the news, that they committed the man to pri&s;on, as a &s;preader of trea&s;onable reports; and had not his tidings been &s;peedily confirmed by the arrival of other &s;trangers, in all probability they would have co&s;t him his life.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their CUSTOMS, LANGUAGE, and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Shetlanders were originally a colony from Norway, to which they were long &s;ubject, and paid a kind of tribute, called <HI>&s;chat,</HI> from whence the country derived the name of Schetland: but the i&s;lands were ceded by treaty to the King of Scotland, for a valuable con&s;ideration, &s;ome cen|turies ago, and &s;ince that period have been an|nexed to the Scotti&s;h crown, forming, with the i&s;les of Orkney, one &s;tewardry, or &s;hire, which &s;ends one member to parliament. The people of Shetland were &s;oon intermixed with the Low|landers
<PB N="406" REF="4240">
of Scotland, &s;o as to become quite a Scotti&s;h colony: they now &s;peak the language, wear the dre&s;s, and follow the cu&s;toms of that country: yet, in &s;ome of the mo&s;t northern i&s;les, the commonalty u&s;e the old Norwegian dialect, which they call Nor&s;e; many learn Dutch of the Hollanders, by whom they are annually vi&s;ited on the fi&s;hery; and they retain &s;ome old cu&s;toms that plainly denote their original. They are ge|nerally &s;imple, hone&s;t, religious, ho&s;pitable, and humane. They live amicably one with another, and &s;hould any accidental quarrel produce animo|mo&s;ity, one of the neighbours commonly makes a fea&s;t, in order to compromi&s;e the di&s;pute, and reconcile the parties. Their chief nouri&s;hment is fi&s;h, which not only &s;upplies them with food, but likewi&s;e with oil, which they burn in lamps dur|ing the winter &s;ea&s;on. Wood they have none; but plenty of turf, peat, and heath, which &s;erves them for fuel. Their common drink is whey, which they barrel up and depo&s;ite in cellars, after it has undergone a kind of fermentation, which gives it a vinous quality: they likewi&s;e drink butter-milk mixed with water. The inhabitants of the le&s;&s;er i&s;les &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon the eggs and fle&s;h of &s;ea-fowl, to who&s;e ne&s;ts they climb with great dexterity, or are lowered down by ropes over precipices, at the imminent danger of their lives: they are like|wi&s;e very expert at fire-arms. Tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s e&s;tates in Shetland, are of Scotch families, and live elegantly, like the gentry of that kingdom. Their hou&s;es are neat and fa&s;hionable; their tables well &s;upplied with a variety of di&s;hes; and they commonly have a good &s;tock of wine, beer, and brandy in their cellars: they wear Engli&s;h cloth, made in the Briti&s;h fa&s;hion, and are remarkable for fine linnen. The Shetlanders have very little occa&s;ion for phy&s;icians: they cure the jaundice
<PB N="407" REF="4250">
with the powder of &s;nail-&s;hells, and the &s;curvy, to which they are &s;ubject, with the cochlearia, or &s;curvy-gra&s;s, found in great plenty on the&s;e i&s;lands. Much more care is taken of their &s;piritual welfare. They profe&s;s the prote&s;tant religion, according to the form and di&s;cipline of the kirk of Scotland, by which they are &s;upplied with pa&s;tors; and the people, on the whole, are &s;ober, religious, and exemplary. The &s;ame government prevails here as in the Orkneys, which we &s;hall de&s;cribe in the next article.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SOIL.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;oil of this country is, for the mo&s;t part, barren, rocky, or &s;andy. Wheat will not ripen, and oats do not thrive in the&s;e i&s;lands: but they produce good crops of barley, which is made into bread for common u&s;e, and found both whole&s;ome and palatable. Here are no trees, and hardly any &s;hrubs, except tho&s;e planted and che|ri&s;hed in gardens, where, however, they can rai&s;e apples, pears, plumbs, goo&s;eberries, &s;trawberries, corinths, all kinds of pot-herbs and roots for the kitchen. The vallies, and even the hills, produce excellent pa&s;ture, and a great variety of plants that are common to all the northern countries of Europe. No venomous creature is found on the&s;e i&s;lands; nor was a wea&s;el to be &s;een, until a faulconer, in revenge to the inhabitants, who had refu&s;ed him the cu&s;tomary due, imported a male and female, which have bred prodigiou&s;ly.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>The Shetland hor&s;es, called <HI>&s;chelties,</HI> though very &s;mall, are neverthele&s;s &s;trong, hardy, well &s;haped, nimble, and &s;ure footed. They are fit for the plough and the &s;addle, and &s;tout enough
<PB N="408" REF="4260">
to carry double, though &s;o light, that an ordinary man may lift one of them from the ground: they are never hou&s;ed, either in winter or &s;ummer, and have no other provender than the gra&s;s they can nibble: when this fails, they vi&s;it the &s;ea-&s;hore regularly, every ebb, and feed upon &s;ea-ware. The &s;ame &s;hift is practi&s;ed by their black cattle and &s;heep, while the ground is covered with &s;now. The&s;e are likewi&s;e of a very &s;mall breed; but juicy, of a delicate flavour, and very fat in the &s;ummer. Their &s;heep are &s;o prolific, that they bring forth two, and &s;ometimes three at a time; but their lambs very often become a prey to the eagle: all dome&s;tic animals, and poultry, are rai&s;ed as ea&s;ily here as in any other country. Fowl of all &s;orts, particularly gee&s;e and ducks of various kinds, abound in the&s;e i&s;lands; we mu&s;t, however, except heath-cocks, grow&s;e, and par|tridges, which Shetland does not produce. Birds of prey are not wanting, &s;uch as eagles, hawks, kites, and crows of different kinds. The &s;ea|fowl &s;warm to &s;uch a degree, as even to darken the &s;ea, and the inhabitants make advantage of their down and feathers. They arrive in the month of February, build among the rocks, where they &s;it very clo&s;e together to hatch their eggs; and when their young are fledged, retreat to &s;ome other country. The &s;ea produces whales, &s;eals, and otters, and all &s;orts of fi&s;h in great abundance. Among the&s;e we number the cod, the ling, the tu&s;k, and, above all, the herring, which is the chief &s;ource of advantage to the&s;e people, and brings con&s;iderable wealth to Holland, and might be an inexhau&s;tible &s;ource of riches to Great Britain. No &s;ooner does the mild &s;ea&s;on begin in this latitude, than the &s;ea is covered with ve&s;&s;els, &s;ometimes to the amount of two thou&s;and. All the ports of Shetland are crowded
<PB N="409" REF="4270">
with &s;trangers: every creek, &s;ound, and channel is over&s;pread with nets, which likewi&s;e appear on every hand at &s;ea, to intercept the innumerable &s;hoals of herrings, which annually migrate from the North Pole towards the more &s;outherly lati|tudes, and divide into two &s;quadrons off the i&s;lands of Shetland. The Dutch only have been known to employ three thou&s;and bu&s;&s;es at once on this herring-fi&s;hery; and they, it mu&s;t be owned, have enriched the towns of Shetland. During the &s;ummer &s;ea&s;on, they &s;et up booths on &s;hore, in which they traffick with the i&s;landers, giving them wine, brandy, &s;pices, and other commodities, as well as a con&s;iderable ballance of money, for their fi&s;h, live &s;tock, ho&s;e, and mittens, which are the manufactures of Shetland. The &s;ame kind of commerce is carried on by the people of Ham|burgh and Bremen, who go thither in May, and open &s;hops in the principal towns and villages. Be&s;ides the fi&s;hes we have mentioned, the Shet|landers catch great abundance of a &s;pecies called &s;eths, large, thick, and &s;o fat, that one liver will produce two quarts of oil, which is exported for &s;oap-making.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PARTICULAR ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The principal i&s;lands of Shetland are the&s;e: Mainland, Bra&s;&s;a, the Skerries, Burray, Whal&s;ey, Vu&s;t, Yell, Fi&s;lar, Foula, Papaflour, and the Lyre Skerries. Mainland, extending &s;ixty miles in length, and twenty in breadth, is indented by a great number of bays, and abounds with mo&s;&s;es, bogs, and mountains, &s;o that it is more adapted for pa&s;turage than corn: neverthele&s;s, the low grounds, near the &s;hore, produce oats and barley. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land &s;tands the princi|pal town, Lerwick, con&s;i&s;ting of about three
<PB N="410" REF="4280">
hundred families. Towards the we&s;t is &s;ituated Scalloway, which, though very &s;mall, is the &s;eat of judicature; and here likewi&s;e the pre&s;bytery of Shetland a&s;&s;embles. It was formerly &s;ecured by a ca&s;tle, now fallen into decay, in which there was once a garri&s;on of Engli&s;h &s;oldiers, &s;ent thither by Oliver Cromwell. The i&s;land of Bra&s;&s;a, &s;itu|ated to the ea&s;tward of Mainland, is about five miles long, and two in breadth; has &s;ome arrable ground, and two churches; but is chiefly re|markable for its &s;ound, in which the great herring|fi&s;hery is carried on. The landlords here are con|&s;iderable gainers, by letting out their ground and hou&s;es for &s;hops to the Dutch and Hamburghers. The Skerries, Burray, Whal&s;ey, and Vu&s;t, are incon&s;iderable i&s;lands, the large&s;t and la&s;t not ex|ceeding eight miles in length: but all of them are provided with churches; and in Vu&s;t, there are three good harbours. Yell in length amounts to &s;ixteen miles, is indented like the figure of eight, has three churches and &s;everal chapels; but the country is moori&s;h and barren. Fe&s;lar, or Fetlor, five miles in length, is remarkable for nothing, but the ruins of &s;ome watch-towers, which the na|tives call Picts hou&s;es. The&s;e are from twenty to thirty feet high, twelve broad, and tapering to the top. The entries are very low, the windows long and narrow, the &s;tairs run up between the walls, and under them are cells vaulted. They were built for watch-towers, or beacons, on the top of which the natives made &s;ignals, by fire, when they were alarmed by inva&s;ion. Foula, about three miles long, is remarkable for a rock, &s;o high, that it may be &s;een in Orkney, and is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome writers to have been the <HI>Ultima Thule</HI> of the antients. Papaflour is a &s;mall plea|&s;ant i&s;land, not exceeding two miles in length, having four commodious harbours, and abound|ing
<PB N="411" REF="4290">
with corn, pa&s;ture, rabbits, and fuel. The Lyre Skerries are &s;o called, becau&s;e frequented by a &s;pecies of fowl &s;o named, which we &s;hall de&s;cribe in the next article.</P>

<HEAD>ISLANDS of ORKNEY: Their NUMBER, and SITUATION.</HEAD>
<P>The Orkney i&s;les, called by the antients Or|cades, lying in the Caledonian Sea, eighteen leagues from Shetland, between the fifty-eighth and &s;ixtieth degrees of latitude, and in longitude from London, between 1&deg; 30&prime;, and 2&deg; 50&prime;, are divided on the &s;outh from Caithne&s;s, the mo&s;t northern point of Scotland, by the Pentland, or Pictland Frith, from twelve to &s;ixteen miles in breadth. They are in number about thirty; but not all inhabited, the greater part being &s;mall holmes that produce nothing but pa&s;turage for &s;heep and goats. The principal i&s;lands are known by the&s;e denominations: South Ronald&s;ha, Swinna, Hoy, Burra, Lambholm, Flotta, Faira, Cava, Gram&s;ey, Mainland, Copin&s;ha, Strupen&s;ha, Dam|&s;ey, Inhallo, Stron&s;a, Papa-Stron&s;a, Sanda, North Ronald&s;ha, Eda, Rou&s;a, Wyre, Gar&s;a, Egle&s;ha, North Faira, We&s;tra, Papa-We&s;tra. The&s;e terminations in a, ey, or ha, were, in the Teutonic, generally given to places &s;urrounded with water. The cur|rents and tides flowing between the i&s;lands, are extremely rapid; and in the neighbourhood of Swinna, are two great whirlpools, called the wells of Swinna, which are counted dangerous by ma|riners, e&s;pecially in a calm. When &s;ailors find them&s;elves &s;ucked into the vortex, they throw overboard a barrel, or &s;ome bulky &s;ub&s;tance, which is &s;aid to &s;mooth the vortex, until the ve&s;&s;el hath pa&s;&s;ed, to be &s;wept down to the bottom, and thrown up again at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance:
<PB N="412" REF="4300">
when there is a breeze of wind, however, &s;hips cro&s;s them without fear or he&s;itation.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CLIMATE, SOIL, PRODUCTIONS VEGETABLE.</HEAD>
<P>The air is pure and penetrating in &s;ummer: the winter, in this latitude, is cold, rainy, and tempe&s;tuous, not without fro&s;t and &s;now, which, however, are of &s;hort duration. The longe&s;t day in &s;ummer exceeds eighteen hours; and, for the greate&s;t part of June, one may &s;ee to read at mid|night, without a candle: at the winter &s;ol&s;tice, the days are dark and &s;hort in proportion. The &s;oil of the Orkneys is, in general, more fertile than that of Shetland: but differs in different i&s;lands, and indeed, in the &s;ame i&s;land, according to the variations in the face of the country. In &s;ome places the country is bare and mountainous; in others, low and mar&s;hy; and great part of the &s;oil is found extremely dry and &s;andy. The&s;e i&s;lands bear plentiful crops of oats and barley, of which they make their bread; but they have no wheat, rye, or pul&s;e, except what grows in well|enclo&s;ed gardens. The&s;e, when duly cultivated, produce all manner of kitchen herbs, roots, &s;alla|dine, and even bring fruit-trees to maturity: but, in the open country, there is &s;carce a tree or &s;hrub to be &s;een, except juniper, wild myrtle, heath, and the cyur-hodon: yet this deficiency cannot be imputed to the poverty of the &s;oil, or the nature of the climate; for the trunks of large oaks are frequently dug up in the mar&s;hes. This is like|wi&s;e the ca&s;e in the mo&s;t barren parts of the Highlands of Scotland, where not a &s;hrub is to be &s;een above the &s;urface of the earth: nay, the inhabitants frequently find, deep in the earth, the roots of large trees, evidently exhibiting marks
<PB N="413" REF="4310">
of the ax, by which they were felled: &s;o that the&s;e northern parts mu&s;t have undergone &s;ome &s;trange revolutions. The Orkneys produce great variety of herbs and berries, gra&s;s and corn, which la&s;t is exported as far as Edinburgh. In &s;ome of the i&s;lands, the natives have di&s;covered mines of tin, lead, and &s;ilver, though none of them are wrought to any advantage: in others, we find abundance of marl, grey and red &s;late, quarries of free&s;tone, and even of marble and alaba&s;ter: when the wind rages to any violence, the &s;ea throws in plenty of timber, torn from other coun|tries, and, not unfrequently, the people find large pieces of ambergrea&s;e. The fre&s;h water in the&s;e i&s;lands is very pure and limpid, and, though there are no large rivers in the Orkneys, the ground is well watered with lakes and plea&s;ant rivulets, that not only &s;erve to turn their mills, but al&s;o abound with trout of the mo&s;t delicate flavour.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANIMALS.</HEAD>
<P>Be&s;ides abundance of little hor&s;es, black cattle, &s;heep, &s;wine, and rabbits, the inhabitants of the Orkneys rear all &s;orts of dome&s;tic animals, and tame poultry. Their heaths and commons yield plenty of red deer, and all &s;orts of game; par|tridges, grow&s;e, heath-cocks, plover, duck, teal, and widgeon: the &s;ea-coa&s;t teems with &s;eals and otters; and are vi&s;ited by whales, cod, ling, tu&s;k, herrings, and all manner of fi&s;h: on the &s;hore, they find &s;perma ceti, os &s;epiae, and a great va|riety of &s;hells and coralines, with a multitude of oy&s;ters, remarkably large mu&s;cles, crabs, and cockles. The rocks are covered with &s;ea-fowl, wild gee&s;e, Solan gee&s;e, barnacles, lyres, eagles, hawks, and kites. With re&s;pect to the barnacles, or, as the natives call them, the cleck gee&s;e,
<PB N="414" REF="4320">
they are &s;aid to be found in &s;hells &s;ticking by the bills to trees, in &s;everal i&s;lands. Martin affirms he has &s;een them in this &s;ituation, but could not perceive them alive; and indeed the whole account of their generation and production, exhibited by the northern naturali&s;ts, is ab&s;urd and unphilo&s;o|phical. The Orkney eagles are &s;o &s;trong, that, ac|cording to the reports of the country, they have been known to carry away young children in their talons. Certain it is, they make &s;uch havock a|mong the lambs, that he who kills an eagle is en|titled by law to a hen from every hou&s;e in the pa|ri&s;h where it was killed. The king's falconer vi|&s;its the&s;e i&s;lands every year, in order to fetch away the young hawks and falcons from their ne&s;ts among the precipices: he enjoys a yearly &s;alary of twenty pounds, and may claim a hen, or a dog, from every hou&s;e in the country, except tho&s;e that are expre&s;sly exempted from this impo&s;ition.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PEOPLE: Their LANGUAGE, and CUSTOMS.</HEAD>
<P>The Orkneys, as well as the hills of Shetland, were originally peopled from Norway, in the ninth, tenth, or eleventh century; and the commonal|ty &s;till retain the language of that kingdom, di|&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Norns: they likewi&s;e pre&s;erve &s;ome cu&s;toms and mea&s;ures of the&s;e Nor|wegian ance&s;tors. The i&s;lands of Orkney have been at different times &s;ubdued by the Scots, and re|covered by the Norwegians: at length they were &s;old by Magnus, king of Norway, to Alexander of Scotland, for the &s;um of four thou&s;and marks &s;terling, and a yearly acknowledgment of one hun|dred marks. Since that period, the Orkneys have continued annexed to the crown of Scotland. The gentry of the Orkneys are civilized, polite, and ho&s;pitable, and live like tho&s;e of Scotland, from
<PB N="415" REF="4330">
whom they are chiefly de&s;cended. They live com|fortably, are remarkably courteous to &s;trangers, and drink a great quantity of wine, with which their cellars are generally well &s;tored. Indeed the inhabitants of the Orkneys may be now ju&s;tly deemed a Scotch colony. They &s;peak the lan|guage, profe&s;s the religion, follow the fa&s;hions, and are &s;ubject to the laws of that people. They are frugal, &s;agacious, circum&s;pect, religious, and ho&s;pitable. Their mariners are remarkably bold, active, dextrous, and hardy. Many &s;urprizing in|&s;tances of longevity occur here, as well as in Shet|land, of per&s;ons living to the age of one hundred and forty. The Orkney women are generally hand&s;ome and well &s;haped, and bring forth chil|dren at a very advanced age. In the pari&s;h of Evie, and the year 1683, one Margery Bimha&s;ter was delivered of a boy at the age of three&s;core and three. In the Orkneys, &s;ome particular lands are held by a tenure, called <HI>Udal Right,</HI> from Ulcius or Olaus king of Norway, who farmed the lands, on condition of receiving one-third of the pro|duce; and this right devolved in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, with|out any charter granted by the &s;overeign. The inhabitants of Orkney, in&s;tead of mea&s;uring their corn, weigh it in pi&s;mores or pundlers. Their lea&s;t denomination is a mark, con&s;i&s;ting of eighteen ounces, and twenty-four marks make a li&s;pound, which is a Dani&s;h quantity. The poorer &s;ort of people in the Orkneys appear very meanly habited, with a piece of &s;eal-&s;kin in&s;tead of &s;hoes; and, liv|ing chiefly on &s;alt-fi&s;h, are &s;ubject to the &s;curvy. They are very much addicted to &s;uper&s;titious rites; in particular, interpreting dreams and omens, and believing in the force of idle charms. On a par|ticular day in harve&s;t, they ab&s;tain from work, in con&s;equence of a notion handed down from tradi|tion, that &s;hould they employ this day in gathering

in their harve&s;t, the ridges of the field would bleed with agony. For the cure of &s;undry di&s;tempers, e&s;pecially an haemorrhage or bleeding, either in man or bea&s;t, they &s;end the name of the patient to the conjurer, who, by means of a charm or &s;pell, removes the di&s;order, though the patient and he are many miles a&s;under. The i&s;lands of Orkney, we have already ob&s;erved, produce very bold, able, and hardy mariners. The common people, in ge|neral, are inured to fatigue, and remarkably ad|venturous, both in fi&s;hing, during rough weather, and in climbing the rocks for the fle&s;h, eggs, and down of &s;ea-fowl. Formerly, while they were ex|po&s;ed to the inva&s;ions of the Norwegians, or we&s;|tern i&s;landers, every village was obliged to equip a large boat well manned; and all the fencible men appeared in arms, when the alarm was given by the beacons lighted on the tops of the rocks and highe&s;t mountains. The&s;e beacons, known by the name of ward-hills, are &s;till to be &s;een in every i&s;land. Their corn land they enclo&s;e with mud or &s;tone walls, to pre&s;erve it from the ravages of their &s;heep, &s;wine, and cattle, which wander about at random, without being attended by herd&s;|men: their ordinary manure, e&s;pecially near the &s;ea-coa&s;t, is &s;ea-weed, which they carefully gather and divide into equal portions. Their &s;heep are marked on the ears and no&s;e; but &s;o wild, that when they have occa&s;ion to &s;heer them in the month of May, they are obliged to hunt every in|dividual, with dogs trained for that purpo&s;e. Their manner of catching &s;ea-fowl is curious and parti|cular. Under the rock where the&s;e fowls build they row their boat, provided with a large net, to the upper corners of which are fa&s;tened two ropes, lowered down from the top of the mountain by men placed in that &s;tation. The&s;e hoi&s;ting up the net, until it be &s;pread oppo&s;ite to the cliffs in which
<PB N="417" REF="4350">
the fowls are &s;itting, the boatmen below make a noi&s;e with a rattle, by which the fowls, be|ing frightened, fly forwards into the bo&s;om of the net, in which they are immediately enclo&s;ed and lowered down into the boat: others practi&s;e the method u&s;ed in Iceland and Norway, and are low|ered down by a &s;ingle rope from the &s;ummit of the mountain; this is the con&s;tant way of robbing the hawk's ne&s;t. In the&s;e i&s;lands &s;ome &s;trange effects are produced by thunder and lightning. In the year 1680 the lightning entering a cow|hou&s;e, in which twelve cows &s;tood in a row, killed every &s;econd bea&s;t as &s;he &s;tood, and left the re&s;t untouched. The di&s;tempers that prevail mo&s;tly in the Orkneys are agues, con&s;umptions, &s;curvy, and itch. The agues, which abound in the &s;pring, the natives cure with a diet-drink of bitters and anti&s;corbutics infu&s;ed in ale: for phthi&s;ical com|plaints they u&s;e the plant arby, and the caryophyl|lus marinus boiled with &s;weet milk. In&s;tead of the common method of cupping, the Orkney &s;urgeon &s;carifies the part with a knife, and, applying a horn, &s;ucks the air out at the &s;mall end with his mouth. Others pretend to remove pains and aches by ex|tracting worms from the part affected: but charms and amulets are mo&s;t con&s;tantly u&s;ed for many di&s;ea&s;es incident to the common people.</P>

<HEAD>GOVERNMENT, LAWS, RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The i&s;les of Orkney and Shetland compo&s;e one &s;tewartry, and &s;end one member to the Briti&s;h parlia|ment. The right of &s;uperiority to the Orkneys was di&s;membered from the crown by the union parlia|ment, and granted for a certain yearly con&s;ideration to the earl of Moreton, by queen Anne, who ap|pointed him hereditary &s;teward and ju&s;ticiary. This nobleman po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the power of creating certain
<PB N="418" REF="4360">
judges called bailiffs. There is one of the&s;e e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in every i&s;land and pari&s;h, with power to &s;u|perintend the manners of the inhabitants, to hold courts and determine civil cau&s;es, according to the laws of Scotland, to the value of ten pounds Scotch money, amounting to &s;ixteen &s;hillings and eight-pence: but all conte&s;ts of higher import are referred to the deci&s;ion of the &s;teward or his depu|ty, who re&s;ides at Kirkwall, which is the &s;eat of ju&s;tice. Sub&s;ervient to the bailiffs are &s;ix or &s;even of the mo&s;t reputable and intelligent inhabitants, who over&s;ee the conduct of their fellows, acting as con&s;tables, and make report of all enormi|ties to the bailiff, who cau&s;es the delinquent to be apprehended and puni&s;hed, if the crime be within the extent of his judicial power; other|wi&s;e he tran&s;mits him to Kirkwall, where he is tried by the &s;teward. The&s;e inferior civil officers are known by the name of law-right-men, and enjoy a very extraordinary privilege. When any theft is committed, and any particular per|&s;on lies under &s;u&s;picion of the crime, the&s;e men, accompanied by &s;ome of their neighbours, have power to make a <HI>ran&s;alling</HI> or &s;earch of the &s;u&s;|pected hou&s;e, for what has been &s;tolen; and if the thief be detected, they bring him to ju&s;tice without further warrant or ceremony. The pro|te&s;tant religion prevails in the i&s;les of Orkney, according to the rites and di&s;cipline of the kirk, the&s;e, and the i&s;les of Shetland, con&s;tituting one pre&s;bytery, which a&s;&s;embles at Kirkwall. The country is divided into eighteen pari&s;hes, con|taining thirty-one churches, and above one hun|dred chapels.</P>

<HEAD>COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>The trade of the Orkneys is not at pre&s;ent very con&s;iderable, though it might be extended to great advantage. They &s;upply with fre&s;h provi&s;ions, for ready money, the &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els that touch up|on the coa&s;t, in the cour&s;e of northern voyages, or in their pa&s;&s;age from the Ea&s;t-Indies, when they go north about Ireland and Scotland, in time of war, to avoid the privateers of the enemy. They are al&s;o vi&s;ited by tho&s;e engaged in the herring fi&s;hery, tho' there is not &s;uch a re&s;ort on this account to the&s;e i&s;lands, as to the i&s;les of Shetland. Neverthele&s;s, a good number of boats from the we&s;tern parts of Scotland, as well as from Londonderry, Belfa&s;t, and other ports of Ireland, fi&s;h for herring as far north as the Leuze, and &s;upply the Orkneys with tobacco, wine, brandy, and other &s;pirituous li|quors, cloths, and divers manufactures. The&s;e they exchange for fi&s;h and oil extracted from por|poi&s;es, &s;eals, and other &s;ea animals. The people of Orkney export annually great numbers of black cattle, &s;wine, and &s;heep; together with large quan|tities of corn, butter, tallow, &s;alt, and &s;tuffs made in the country, over and above the &s;kins of &s;eals, otters, lambs, and rabbits, down, feathers, writ|ing quills, hams, and wool: yet all the&s;e articles would, in point of profit, fall infinitely &s;hort of their herring-fi&s;hery, were it pro&s;ecuted with indu&s;try, oeconomy, and vigour. As there are no merchants in the Orkneys at pre&s;ent, who export fi&s;h on their own account, what herrings are taken they &s;ell to the Dutch or Scotch dealers in and about Inverne&s;s. They generally fi&s;h for herring on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Orkneys, and are therefore more remote from markets, than tho&s;e who are employ|ed in the &s;ame manner on the coa&s;t of Shetland.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>We may reckon among the curio&s;ities of the Orkneys, the <HI>Pha&s;eoli,</HI> commonly known by the name of Molucca beans, which are thrown upon the &s;hore after &s;torms of we&s;terly wind, and are &s;uppo&s;ed to be driven thus far north from the We&s;t-Indies, where they grow. Many &s;trange fi&s;hes and curious &s;hells are al&s;o frequently ca&s;t up by the ocean; of the&s;e la&s;t a va&s;t variety for adorning the cabinets of modern naturali&s;ts. Some|times exotic fowls are driven upon the Orkneys by tempe&s;tuous weather: fi&s;h, as large as whitings, have been thrown a&s;hore to a con&s;iderable di&s;tance within the land. At Cantick-head, in the i&s;land Waes, and &s;ome other places, huge &s;tones are often heaved up by the violence of the &s;ea and wind, and ca&s;t over high rocks upon the land. A &s;ingle Laplander has been &s;een more than once on this coa&s;t, in his &s;lender canoe, covered with &s;kins, being driven hither by adver&s;e winds and &s;torms. In the pari&s;h of Harn, in the main land, a large piece of a &s;tag's horn was found very deep in the earth where the natives were digging for marle. In the pari&s;h of Evie, near the &s;ea-coa&s;t, are divers &s;mall hillocks that &s;ometimes appear as if covered with flame in the night: the &s;ame phaenomenon is ob&s;ervable in the pari&s;h church called St. Nicho|las, and is probably nothing el&s;e but &s;ome bitu|minous exhalation. At the noup-head in We&s;tra there is a rock, called Li&s;s, &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, &s;uppo&s;ed to be endued with a very &s;urpri&s;ing pro|perty. The i&s;landers believe that if a man, having a piece of iron about him, &s;hould land on this rock, the &s;ea would in&s;tantly &s;well and foam with incre|dible fury, which would not abate until the iron &s;hould be thrown away. This, however, is no more than a tale of idle &s;uper&s;tition. The Orkneys are
<PB N="421" REF="4390">
not altogether de&s;titute of antient monuments and curio&s;ities of art. In Hoy we find an entire &s;tone, thirty-&s;ix feet long, eighteen in breadth, and nine in thickne&s;s, lying between two hills, and known by the name of dwarfic &s;tone. It is hollowed with|in by the tools of a ma&s;on, the marks of which are &s;till apparent. The entrance is a &s;quare hole about two feet high, with a &s;tone, by way of door, &s;tanding before it. Within we find a bed with a pillow cut out of the &s;tone; at the other end is a couch of the &s;ame kind; and in the middle a hearth, above which there is a hole or vent for the exit of the &s;moke. This curio&s;ity is found in the mid&s;t of a de&s;olate heath, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the re&s;idence of a hermit: in the very neighbourhood of this &s;tone there is a very high and &s;teep mountain, called the <HI>wart hill of Hoy,</HI> near the &s;ummit of which, in the months of May, June, and July, &s;omething at noon-day is &s;een to &s;hine and &s;parkle with remarkable lu&s;tre, &s;uppo&s;|ed by the common people to be an inchanted car|buncle, many per&s;ons have clambered up the hill in que&s;t of it, but found nothing. Perhaps this &s;plendour is produced by the reflexion of the &s;un on a &s;mall &s;tream of water &s;liding over the face of a &s;mooth rock. At Stennis, in the main land, there is a cau&s;eway of &s;tones over a loch or lake, at the &s;outh end of which we ob&s;erve a circle of &s;tones, ri&s;ing about twenty feet above ground, each being &s;ix feet in breadth, and from one to two feet in thickne&s;s: between this circle and the cau&s;eway two &s;tones of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions &s;tand by them&s;elves, and one of them is perforated in the middle. At the di&s;tance of half a mile from the other end of the cau&s;eway appears a larger circle of the &s;ame kind of &s;tones, the diametet of which may amount to one hundred and ten paces; &s;ome of the&s;e &s;tones are fallen; and to the ea&s;t and
<PB N="422" REF="4400">
we&s;t of the larger circle are two artificial green mounts. Both rounds are &s;urrounded with a ditch; and one cannot view them without admiration, con&s;idering the art that mu&s;t have been u&s;ed to bring &s;uch unwieldy ma&s;&s;es together in this order. They were probably temples and places of &s;acri|fice u&s;ed in times of pagan &s;uper&s;tition; and &s;eem to bear a great affinity with the celebrated monu|ment, called Stonehenge, on Sali&s;bury Plain in Eng|land. In one of the mounts, at the north end of the cau&s;eway, the natives found nine <HI>Fibulae,</HI> or cla&s;ps of &s;ilver, formed into a circle, and re&s;embling a hor&s;e-&s;hoe. In many different places of the Ork|neys we find rude obeli&s;ks or &s;ingle &s;tones of a great height, &s;et up either as memorials of battles, trea|ties, or the decea&s;e of remarkable per&s;onages. In Rou&s;ay, between two high mountains, there is a place which the natives di&s;tingui&s;h by the appel|lation of the camp of <HI>Jupiter Fring:</HI> but the mean|ing of this name, handed down by tradition, is not known. At the we&s;t end of the main land, near Skeal, we find a &s;urpri&s;ing cau&s;eway, above a quar|ter of a mile in length, on the &s;ummit of high hills, compo&s;ed of reddi&s;h &s;tones of different mag|nitude, impre&s;&s;ed with various figures, both on the upper and under &s;urface. Some gentlemen in the neighbourhood have carried off the mo&s;t beau|tiful of the&s;e &s;tones, to be &s;et in their chimnies by way of ornament, like the painted tiles of Hol|land. This country produces many &s;epulchres of different nations. In the plains or links of Skeal, the &s;and being blown away from the &s;ur|face of the ground, &s;everal &s;quare catacombs ap|pear built of &s;tones well cemented together, con|taining &s;ome parcels of black earth, and each &s;e|cured by a large &s;tone at the mouth. Sepulchres of the &s;ame kind are found at Rou&s;um in Strou|&s;a, which is likewi&s;e remarkable for a different
<PB N="423" REF="4410">
kind of monument, con&s;i&s;ting of one intire &s;tone cylinder hollowed, with a bottom like that of a barrel, and a round &s;tone to fill up the entrance: above the &s;tone was &s;harpened into an edge; with|in were found &s;ome burned bones and red clay; and over it was placed a large flat &s;tone for the pre&s;ervation of the whole. The&s;e, in all probabi|lity, were Roman caracombs. In We&s;tra divers Dani&s;h graves have been di&s;covered: in one of the&s;e appeared the &s;keleton of a man, with a &s;word on one &s;ide, and a Dani&s;h ax on the other. Some have been found buried with dogs, combs, knives, and other uten&s;ils. In many places of the coun|try we find round hillocks or barrows, here known by the name of Brogh, &s;ignifying, in the Teuto|nic language, burying place, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the cimeteries of the antient Saxons. In different parts of the&s;e i&s;lands we &s;ee the remains of great buildings, believed to have been fortre&s;&s;es erected by the Danes or Norwegians when they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the country. One of the&s;e in the i&s;le of Wyre, called the ca&s;tle of Coppi-row, &s;ignifying a town of &s;ecurity, is &s;urrounded by a fo&s;&s;e, and the fir&s;t floor &s;till remains above ground, a perfect &s;quare of &s;tone wall very thick, &s;trongly built, and cemented with lime, the area within not exceeding ten feet in length. Of this Coppi-row the com|mon people relate many idle fables. In the cha|pel of Clet, in the i&s;le of Sanda, there is a grave nineteen feet long, in which was found part of a man's back bone, larger than that of a hor&s;e. Hu|man bones, of nearly the &s;ame &s;ize, have been dug up in We&s;tra; and indeed this country is remark|able for producing men of a gigantic &s;tature. With|in the antient fabrick of Lady Kirk in South Ro|nal&s;haw, there is a &s;tone four feet long, and two feet broad, on which the print of two $eet are en|graven,

<HEAD>PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION of the PARTICULAR ISLANDS.</HEAD>
<P>The Orkneys are commonly divided into &s;outh and north i&s;lands, according to their &s;ituation. The mo&s;t &s;outhern, called South Ronal&s;haw, ex|tending &s;ix miles in length and five in breadth, is fine land, fruitful in corn, pa&s;ture, and cat|tle; indented with divers bays, and ble&s;&s;ed with two good harbours. There are two churches at different ends of the i&s;land; one of the&s;e is Lady Kirk, an old ruinous building, for which the na|tives entertain the mo&s;t &s;uper&s;titious veneration. From Burray, at the &s;outh point of Ronal&s;haw, there is a ferry to Duncan's bay in Caithne&s;s on the coa&s;t of Scotland. This i&s;land is &s;eparated by a narrow channel on the ea&s;t from Flatta, and the i&s;le of Waes lies to the we&s;tward.</P>
<P>A little farther to the &s;outh ri&s;es the i&s;le of Swen|na or Sound, remarkable for the wells or whirl|pools which we have de&s;cribed above. Though the length of it does not exceed two miles, and the breadth half as much, it produces good crops of corn; is inhabited by hu&s;bandmen chiefly; yields a good quarry of &s;lates; and plenty of fi&s;h are caught along the coa&s;t. Pentland, or Pightland Skerries, is a &s;mall i&s;land &s;urrounded by dangerous rocks abounding with &s;eals and wild fowl. The mo&s;t romantic of all the&s;e i&s;lands is Hoy, the ea&s;t|ern part of which is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of Waes. It extends about twelve miles in length, and in breadth &s;ix, where broade&s;t. The Waes is fertile and populous; but the re&s;t mountainous, and thinly inhabited. Adjoining to this i&s;land, on the we&s;t, by a very narrow i&s;thmus, is a rock
<PB N="425" REF="4430">
called Bradbrugh, that forms a &s;trong, natural for|tre&s;s. Hoy is provided with &s;ome good harbours, though they are very little frequented; and it like|wi&s;e affords a ferry from Snell-&s;etter to Ham in Caithne&s;s. The country is watered by &s;everal lakes and &s;treams that abound with trout. From the tops of the monntains in Hoy the reflexion of the &s;un is &s;een all night at the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice. The&s;e mountains abound with wild &s;heep, and hares as white as &s;now. Here are deep vallies, dark and narrow, overhung with impending rocks that half exclude the day, and &s;trike the eye of a traveller with awe and terror. The mini&s;ter of Hoy, be&s;ides his own church, officiates in another, &s;ituated on the &s;mall, but plea&s;ant i&s;le of Gram|&s;ey, to the northward of Hoy. He that belongs to the kirk of Waes, has likewi&s;e another in the little i&s;land of Flotta; and his charge likewi&s;e in|cludes the two &s;mall i&s;lands of Faira and Cava, that lie to the ea&s;tward of Waes. Flotta lying to the we&s;tward of Hoy is about five miles long, two and a half in breadth where broade&s;t, and almo&s;t &s;urrounded with high rocks. It abounds with game and fi&s;h of all &s;orts, is provided with one church, but produces little corn, and is thinly inhabited. Burra, nearly of the &s;ame &s;ize, is a plea|&s;ant i&s;land, affording plenty of corn, pa&s;turage, hor&s;es, black cattle, &s;heep, rabbits, together with excellent turf and peat for fewel.</P>
<P>Pomona, as being the large&s;t of the Orkney i&s;lands, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the epithet of the main land. The length of it amounts to twenty-four miles, and the breadth to nine in &s;ome places. It contains nine pari&s;h churches; has four excellent harbours, namely, Kirkwall, Deer Sound, Gra|ham&s;hall, and Kaer&s;ton. It is well watered by di|vers lakes and rivulets abounding with trout and &s;almon; the country produces &s;everal mines of
<PB N="426" REF="4440">
black lead; is generally fruitful and populous; and the coa&s;t is di&s;tingui&s;hed by divers bays and promontories. The ea&s;tern part, called Deerne&s;s, is a penin&s;ula joined to the main land by a very narrow i&s;thmus, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been formerly a fore&s;t for deer, whence it derived its name. This di&s;trict is plea&s;ant and populous, provided with a church, and adorned with the &s;eats of &s;everal gen|tlemen. The capital of this i&s;land, and indeed the only remarkable town belonging to the Orkneys, is Kirkwall, built upon an inlet of the &s;ea, near the middle of the i&s;land, having a very &s;afe road and harbour for &s;hipping. This is a royal borough, go|verned by a provo&s;t, four bailiffs, and a common|council. It was formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Nor|wegians, who be&s;towed upon it the name of Cru|coviaca, and e&s;tabli&s;hed the corporation about the latter end of the fifteenth century. From king James III. of Scotland they obtained a new char|ter, confirming their antient privileges, impow|ering them to elect their own magi&s;trates yearly, to hold borough courts, arre&s;t, impri&s;on, make laws and ordinances for the right government of the town; to have a weekly market and three fairs annually at certain fixed terms: he moreover granted to them &s;ome lands adjoining to the town, with the cu&s;toms and &s;hore dues, the power of a pit and gallows, and exempted them from the ex|pence of &s;ending commi&s;&s;ioners to parliament. This charter has been confirmed by &s;ucceeding monarchs. At pre&s;ent Kirkwall is the &s;eat of ju&s;|tice, where the &s;teward, &s;heriff, and commi&s;&s;ary hold their &s;everal courts of juri&s;diction: here is likewi&s;e a public grammar-&s;chool, endowed with a competent &s;alary for the ma&s;ter. The town con|&s;i&s;ts of one narrow &s;treet about a mile in length. The hou&s;es are chiefly covered with &s;late, though not at all remarkable for neatne&s;s or convenience.
<PB N="427" REF="4450">
The principal edifices are the cathedral church, and the bi&s;hop's palace. The former called St. Magnus, from Magnus king of Norway, the &s;up|po&s;ed founder of the town, is a large, gothic &s;tructure. The roof is &s;upported by fourteen pil|lars on each &s;ide, and the &s;pire is built upon four large columns. The gates are decorated with a kind of mo&s;aic work, of red and white &s;tones ele|gantly carved and flowered. By the ruins of the king's ca&s;tle, or citadel, it appears to have been a &s;trong and &s;tately fortre&s;s. At the north end of the town there is a &s;ort of a fortification built by the Engli&s;h in the time of Oliver Cromwell. It is &s;urrounded with a ditch and rampart, and &s;till mounted with &s;ome cannon for the defence of the harbour. In the we&s;t end of this i&s;land &s;till ap|pear the ruins of the king's palace, built by Ro|bert Stuart, earl of Orkney, about the year 1574. The edifice &s;eems to have been two &s;tories high; and &s;everal apartments were curiou&s;ly painted with incidents taken from the &s;cripture.</P>
<P>At the north-we&s;t corner of Pomona is the &s;mall i&s;le Alhallow, noted for a good fi&s;hery. To the ea&s;t lies Copin&s;ha, &s;mall, but fruitful, with its holm called the Hor&s;e of Copin&s;ha. On the north &s;ide of Pomona are &s;ituated the northern i&s;les Sha|pen&s;ha, Strou&s;a, Papa-Strou&s;a, Sanna, North Ro|nal&s;a, Eda, Dam&s;ey, Rou&s;ay, Egli&s;ha, We&s;tra, Papa-We&s;tra, Wegre, Ou&s;kerrie, and Fair I&s;land. Shapen&s;ha, lying over-again&s;t Kirkwall, &s;tretching &s;ix miles in length and three in breadth, has the advantage of a &s;afe harbour at Elwick, is provid|ed with a church, and abounds with turf and wild fowl. Strou&s;a, lying to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, of nearly the &s;ame &s;ize, has two convenient harbours. One of the&s;e, at Lenga&s;ound, is formed by a holm: the other, at Strynic, is &s;ecured by the little i&s;land Papa-Strou&s;a, plea&s;ant, populous, and fertile. To

the northward of the&s;e lies Sanda, a narrow i&s;land extending twelve miles in length, abounding with corn and rabbits, and counted the mo&s;t beautiful as well as the mo&s;t fruitful of all the Orcades. It has the advantage of two roads for &s;hipping; one at Kettletoft, fenced by the little holm called El|ne&s;s; the other at Otter&s;wick, guarced by the lit|tle fruitful i&s;land of North Ronal&s;a, the mo&s;t north|ern of all the Orkneys. Sanda produces black cattle, &s;heep, rabbits, and fi&s;h in abundance. There is likewi&s;e plenty of corn, hay, and pa&s;ture: but the poor people have no other fuel but the dung of cattle dried, &s;traw, and the wrecks of ve&s;&s;els, which are often ca&s;t away on the northern &s;ide of this i&s;land, which is very low, and con&s;equently dangerous to mariners.</P>
<P>To the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Sanda we find the i&s;le of Eda, ten miles long, and near five in breadth, co|vered with hills and mora&s;&s;es, thinly inhabited, but abounding with game. On the north &s;ide there is a &s;afe road, called Calf &s;ound, defended by a large holm, on which there is a &s;alt pan. Near the harbour is a high promontory, famous for a breed of excellent hawks. Dam&s;ey is a &s;mall i&s;land at the bottom of a large bay, to the we&s;t-ward of Kirkwall, having on one &s;ide a holm as big as it&s;elf. Rou&s;a to the north-we&s;t, &s;tretching eight miles in length and &s;ix in breadth, abounds with hills covered with heath; and is well &s;tored with rabbits, plover, and moor game; but is thinly inhabited, except upon the coa&s;t, where the &s;oil produces good corn. Egle&s;ha is a &s;mall fertile i&s;land about three miles long, having the advan|tage of a commodious road for &s;hipping. Here is a neat little church with a high &s;teeple, &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome per&s;ons to be the place where St. Mag|nus, patron of the Orkneys, lies buried. We&s;tra, to the northward of Egle&s;ha, is a fruitful and po|pulous

i&s;land &s;even miles long, with a convenient harbour defended by a &s;trong ca&s;tle. A little far|ther to the northward lies Papa-We&s;tra, about three miles in length, agreeable and fertile, and abound|ing with corn and rabbits. The inhabitants of this i&s;land are remarkable for courage, longevity, and gigantic &s;tature. Martin mentions one William Muir, of Papa-We&s;tra, who had arrived at the age of one hundred and forty. Here, as we have ob|&s;erved above, many Dani&s;h graves have been di&s;|covered. Weyre is a very &s;mall i&s;land, which, neverthele&s;s, produces good corn, and is remark|able for the ruins of a con&s;iderable fort, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built by the Picts or Danes. Ou&s;|kerrie is a &s;mall rocky i&s;land to the north-ea&s;t of Strou&s;a, where abundance of fi&s;h is caught.</P>
<P>Midway, between Orkney and Shetland, ri&s;es the fair i&s;land in three high promontories, envi|roned with rocks, and inacce&s;&s;ible, except on the north-ea&s;t, where the land flattens, and forms a convenient harbour. This i&s;land produces good corn and cattle, and the coa&s;t abounds with a va|riety of excellent fi&s;h; the hawks that breed here are counted excellent; and the country is well &s;ituated for trade: neverthele&s;s it is but thinly inhabited, becau&s;e the inhabitants are apt to be plundered by foreign mariners and fi&s;hermen. It obtained the name of Fair I&s;land from its lying in the fair way, that is, in the direct channel between the Orkneys and Shetland. In time of war the Dutch convoys commonly crui&s;e in the neighbour|hood of this i&s;land, to wait for their &s;hips from Ea&s;t-India that come north about.</P>

<PB N="432" REF="4500">
in their ignorance of luxury and ambition, they live without pride, avarice, and almo&s;t without contention, enjoying the hard-earned nece&s;&s;aries of life with a &s;urprizing &s;erenity of temper; adher|ing to the duties of nature, undebauched; ble&s;&s;ed with good natural capacities, faithful, mild, humane, and remarkably ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers, whom they cultivate even with a religious veneration. Perhaps the&s;e people might be ju&s;tly deemed the happie&s;t of mortals, were not their felicity invaded by the horrors of &s;uper&s;tition, to which they are mi&s;erably &s;ubject, &s;uch as &s;igns, tokens, charms, omens, dreams, and a p&s;eudophrotic &s;pirit, which they di&s;tingui&s;h by the appellation of the &s;econd &s;ight. Some of their particular cu&s;toms will be mentioned and explained in the cour&s;e of de|&s;cribing the different i&s;lands. Their habit, like that of the other Highlanders of Scotland, con&s;i&s;ts of a &s;hort coat made of plaid, which they call tar|tan, and, by way of a cloak or upper covering, a piece of loo&s;e drapery of the &s;ame &s;tuff, twelve yards in width, worn over the &s;houlder like the Roman toga, and fa&s;tened round the middle with a leather belt, in &s;uch a manner that part of the plaid hangs down before and behind, like a petticoat, &s;upplying the want of breeches. This way of wearing the plaid is called the kilt; but &s;ometimes, in lieu of the kilt, they wear a kind of petticoat of the &s;ame variegated &s;tuff, buckled round the wai&s;t, and this they denomi|nate the philebeg. In&s;tead of knit &s;tockings, they wear tartan ho&s;e, tied under the knee with garters, finely &s;triped and curiou&s;ly knotted in a bunch, or to&s;&s;el, by way of ornament: their feet are ca&s;ed in brogues of ill-dre&s;&s;ed leather, and their heads are covered with flat blue caps, which they call bonnets. The dre&s;s of the women con&s;i&s;ts of a petticoat and jerkin, with &s;trait &s;leeves, &s;ometimes of &s;carlet

trimmed with gold lace, and buttoned at the wri&s;t; of a plaid by way of upper garment, fa&s;tened on the brea&s;t with a buckle of &s;ilver or bra&s;s, &s;ome|times as large as an ordinary trencher, curiou&s;ly cha&s;ed or embo&s;&s;ed, and containing a le&s;&s;er buckle in the center, &s;et with chry&s;tal or other precious &s;tones. This plaid is tied round the wai&s;t by a leathern belt, adorned with plates of &s;ilver, and ending in a long piece of the &s;ame metal, adorned with precious &s;tones, or red coral. The head is covered with a kerchief of fine linnen, tied flat over the forehead, with the ends hanging down the neck behind: a ringlet of hair flows down the cheek as far as the bo&s;om, and the lower end is ornamented with a knot of ribbons. This dre&s;s, however, is now laid a&s;ide by per&s;ons of any rank or fa&s;hion, in favour of that which is worn in the more civilized parts of Great-Britain. Before the late rebellion, &s;carce a Highlander was to be &s;een without a curious iron pi&s;tol &s;lung in his belt, a broad &s;word under his arm, and a large leathern pur&s;e, decorated with &s;ilver, hanging before him: but the Briti&s;h parliament hath thought proper to forbid this peculiarity of dre&s;s, which was &s;uppo&s;ed to keep up odious and dangerous di&s;tinctions among his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, and maintain a mar|tial &s;pirit, to the prejudice of the public peace. Several regiments, however, compo&s;ed of this people, &s;till retain the antient garb, which is not only agreeable to the eye, but admirably adapted for the u&s;e of a &s;oldier. The feet, legs, and thighs, are kept cool, by a con&s;tant undulation of air, in marching, as well as &s;trengthened and &s;teeled, by being expo&s;ed to the weather; the joints are un|fettered and unincumbered by unnece&s;&s;ary dra|pery; and the plaid &s;erves occa&s;ionally to &s;creen his military arms from the rain, and him&s;elf from all the inclemencies of the air. An Highlander,
<PB N="434" REF="4530">
provided with a plaid, &s;ets night and cold and &s;torms at defiance. Wherever darkne&s;s overtakes him, whether in wood or heath, or hut or den, he lays him down, &s;ecurely wrapped in his plaid, and &s;leeps as &s;ound as if he were in a palace: nay, in the common cour&s;e of travelling, he will not take the trouble to go half a mile out of his way, tho', by &s;o doing, he is certain of finding a good bed and warm lodging. The&s;e people, being ac|cu&s;tomed to the u&s;e of arms from their infancy, are bold, re&s;olute, and intrepid; and though na|turally lazy, yet when their occa&s;ions require ex|ertion, remarkably active, and patient of hunger and fatigue. This martial turn, joined to a cho|leric di&s;po&s;ition, hot, fiery, and vindictive, has produced abundance of mi&s;chief among families, and indeed between whole clans, or tribes, exciting mortal feuds, and even inte&s;tine war: but, in pro|portion as they have been civilized, this barbarous &s;pirit hath &s;ub&s;ided; and no family quarrels of any con&s;equence now remain, except in the &s;ongs of their bards, whom they di&s;tingui&s;h by the name of <HI>&s;hanachies.</HI> Every laird, or chief, entertains one or more of the&s;e &s;hanachies, who, in old bal|lads, or extempore rhimes, recites the exploits of his patron's ance&s;tors, in which he never fails to mingle extravagant flattery and fiction. Another con&s;tant menial of the hou&s;hold is the mu&s;ician, or bag-piper, who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s and privilege it is to wake the laird and his family in the morning with the &s;ound of his in&s;trument; to play for a certain length of time in the great hall, with a &s;ilken flag, or broad ribbon, affixed to his chanter-pipe; to walk in proce&s;&s;ion before his ma&s;ter to church, &s;ounding the march, or pi|broch, of the family; to entertain him and his gue&s;ts at all fe&s;tal meetings; in time of war, to march at the head of the clan, and animate them
<PB N="435" REF="4540">
to battle with martial tunes, compo&s;ed for that purpo&s;e. Such is the power and influence of this &s;imple min&s;trel&s;y over the&s;e people, that the piper, by varying his airs, can melt them into &s;orrow and de&s;pondence, and again rou&s;e them to rage and revenge, and a total contempt of danger and of death. Nay, in the greate&s;t emergency of war, they will not march a furlong, nor draw a &s;word, without being cheared by the mu&s;ick of this in&s;trument. Many cu&s;toms of the antient Highlanders are now laid a&s;ide. Every young chieftain, when he a&s;&s;umed the reins of go|vernment, was placed on a heap of &s;tones, &s;ur|rounded by his adherents, and by one of his prin|cipal friends, inve&s;ted with the &s;word of his father, and a white rod, in token of &s;overeignty: there he was harangued by the &s;hanachie, or orator, who expatiated upon the valour and virtues of his an|ce&s;tors; but the young chieftain was never rai&s;ed to this eminence, until he had made an incur&s;ion into the lands of &s;ome other clan, with which he was at variance, and exhibited undoubted proofs of valour and conduct: upon &s;uch a military expe|dition, it was cu&s;tomary to kill the fir&s;t animal that chanced to meet them on the enemy's ground, and &s;prinkle its blood on their colours as an omen of &s;ucce&s;s. Some of tho&s;e lairds have hereditary offices e&s;tabli&s;hed in their families; &s;uch as &s;tandard-bearer and quarter-ma&s;ter; and this la&s;t enjoys, as a perqui&s;ite, the hides of all the cattle which are taken and killed in their military expe|ditions. Every hou&s;e or ca&s;tle of a chief was furni&s;hed with a centinel, called cockman, who &s;tood all night in a watch-tower, and challenged every per&s;on that approached. The chief was al|ways attended, in his expeditions, with a kind of life-guard, compo&s;ed of young gentlemen, who were trained up in the exerci&s;e of the &s;word and
<PB N="436" REF="4550">
target, and taught to wre&s;tle, &s;hoot with bow and arrow, leap, dance, climb, &s;wim, and navigate their ve&s;&s;els. His armour-bearer, called gallo|glach, was always at his &s;ide, by night and by day, to prevent &s;urprize, and him he gratified with a double portion of meat at every meal: among the officers that were hereditary, we may likewi&s;e reckon the cup-bearer, the pur&s;e-bearer, and two &s;tewards, or merchants, the &s;uperior of whom, be|ing &s;killed in the pedigrees of all the Highland chieftains, adju&s;ted the ceremony, with re&s;pect to precedency at the table, by means of a white wand, with which he mar&s;halled the gue&s;ts in &s;ilence. The&s;e, and a great many other peculiar cu&s;toms, are now laid a&s;ide; but an incredible number of &s;uper&s;titious rites are &s;till retained by the vulgar. The &s;urprizing attachment of the clans to their re|&s;pective chieftains was not only founded upon the nature of their tenures, by which, in effect, they were bound &s;ervants to their lords; but likewi&s;e flowed from inclination, inculcated from father to &s;on, and cheri&s;hed from their tender years by ex|hortation and example. The Highlanders are ad|dicted to exce&s;&s;ive drinking, a practice which they indulge to a great degree of emulation, as a proof of their ho&s;pitality and prowe&s;s. The gen|tlemen regale them&s;elves with French wines, or brandy, which are &s;muggled in great quantities on this coa&s;t; and tho&s;e who cannot afford to pur|cha&s;e the&s;e imports, content them&s;elves with a corn-&s;pirit, di&s;tilled in their own country, under the name of whi&s;ky, which, though &s;trong and fiery, they are enabled, by long u&s;e and habit, to &s;wallow in great do&s;es, without any prejudice to their health. Many cu&s;toms prevail in the i&s;lands, which are now forgot in the neighbouring conti|nent. If a cow drops two calves, or a &s;heep brings forth two lambs at a birth, one of each is the pro|perty
<PB N="437" REF="4560">
of the tenant's ma&s;ter; and if any tenant's wife bears twins, one of them is brought up at the laird's expence. Martin tells us, that he knew &s;ixteen of the&s;e twins, at one time, in a gentle|man's family; an argument of the prolific con&s;ti|tutions of the&s;e people. Leagues of friend&s;hip between individuals were antiently cemented with the blood of both parties, a drop of which, drawn from the little finger, they mutually &s;wallowed. This confirmation was held &s;o &s;acred, that neither could violate the alliance, without expo&s;ing him&s;elf to contempt and infamy. When a tenant dies, the lord has his choice of all the hor&s;es belonging to the farm: this prerogative is called <HI>eachfuin ho|rozeilda,</HI> or a lord's gift. No woman was formerly in&s;tructed in the art of writing, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould en|gage in a literary corre&s;pondence that might be dangerous to her virtue and reputation. After the extinction of the Druids, who are &s;uppo&s;ed to have had groves and rece&s;&s;es of old in &s;ome of the&s;e i&s;lands, the orators and bards &s;ucceeded to their influence. They &s;at among the nobles and chieftains in the &s;treah, or circle, at public a&s;&s;em|blies; their hou&s;es were &s;anctuaries; and they pronounced occa&s;ional harangues at all meetings, whether formal or fe&s;tal. At all weddings, where the poet, bard, or orator, &s;poke the epithalamium, he was intitled to the bridegroom's upper garb, namely, the plaid and bonnet: nay, if he de|manded the habit, arms, or hor&s;e of any chief|tain, his reque&s;t was immediately granted, while the&s;e literati maintained their original dignity. At pre&s;ent, however, they are much degenerated in point of e&s;timation, in&s;omuch that a bard is al|mo&s;t as much de&s;pi&s;ed in the Highlands of Scot|land, as he is neglected in the metropolis of Great-Britain. The Highlanders hold their chiefs in &s;uch veneration, that they conclude the grace after
<PB N="438" REF="4570">
every meal with a prayer for the laird's welfare and pro&s;perity: they even &s;wear by his hand: they chearfully devote them&s;elves to death for his &s;afety; and, &s;hould he decline into the vale of misfortunes, they think it their duty to &s;upport him and his family by voluntary contribution. The Highlanders are very expert in managing the broad-&s;word and target, an exerci&s;e to which they are trained from their youth; and the&s;e were the arms they wielded in battle, together with a &s;hort dirk, or dagger, until they were re-inforced with mu&s;kets and pi&s;tols, the u&s;e of which they now perfectly under&s;tand. Their method of fighting is to ad|vance within gun-&s;hot of the enemy, pour in a vol|ley of &s;mall-arms, then throw down their pieces, draw their broad-&s;words, and attack with incredi|ble impetuo&s;ity, in a wedge, or column, which they naturally form with &s;urprizing dexterity. When they happen to be &s;o hampered, that they have not room to u&s;e the broad-&s;word, they un|&s;heath their dirks, and, mingling with the adver|&s;ary, make terrible havock. Such were the me|thods practi&s;ed by the Highlanders, before they were formed into regular regiments for the &s;ervice of the public. At pre&s;ent the&s;e regiments retain their old dre&s;s, and the broad-&s;word; but in other re&s;pects they conform to the exerci&s;e and di&s;cipline of the other troops in the Briti&s;h army, and always behave with remarkable &s;obriety, order, and intre|pidity.</P>
<P>The better &s;ort of the Highlanders live like their neighbours; but the common people are wretch|edly lodged, in paultry cottages or cabins, built of loo&s;e &s;tones and mud, and thatched with &s;traw; their partitions are no other than a kind of hurdle, pla&s;tered with clay; they have neither gla&s;s in their windows, nor any other chimney than a hole in the middle of the roof, through which the &s;moke finds its way: immediately under this aperture,
<PB N="439" REF="4580">
there is a hearth made of &s;tone, upon which they burn wood, peat, or turf, the &s;moke of which fills the whole hou&s;e in &s;uch a manner, that a &s;tranger, unaccu&s;tomed to the annoyance, would be in dan|ger of &s;uffocation. Around the hearth, in cold weather, the family &s;it or lie, and work or &s;leep, as the occa&s;ion requires: at the farther end of the &s;ame hou&s;e, the cattle are &s;talled; and it is not at all uncommon to &s;ee the calves, the pigs, and the children, lying together promi&s;cuou&s;ly. The&s;e people are utter &s;trangers to cleanline&s;s; they are extremely &s;lutti&s;h in their hou&s;es, and na&s;ty in their per&s;ons; and this impurity is, in all likeli|hood, one great cau&s;e of that inveterate itch, with which they are &s;o generally infe&s;ted.</P>
<P>The men are exce&s;&s;ively fond of tobacco, which they u&s;e in all the different ways, of chewing, &s;moking, and &s;nuff. Their food con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of oatmeal, chee&s;e, butter, milk, and whey; though they likewi&s;e eat fle&s;h meat, namely, beef, mutton, goat, kid, and veni&s;on, and that much oftener than their neighbours of the Lowlands, becau&s;e they have greater plenty of cattle and &s;heep, and can maintain them at a very &s;mall ex|pence.

<P>With re&s;pect to the diver&s;ions of this country, both &s;exes are much addicted to dancing, and ge|nerally very expert and agile at this exerci&s;e, which they perform with great vivacity to bri&s;k tunes, plaid in very quick time, according to the genius and activity of the people. The men amu&s;e them|&s;elves al&s;o in running, leaping, wre&s;tling, throw|ing huge &s;tones, fencing, &s;hooting, hunting, and fi&s;hing, by which means they acquire dexterity, &s;trength, and a remarkable degree of ela&s;ticity in all their members.</P>

<HEAD>LANGUAGE, GOVERNMENT, LAWS, and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The language u&s;ed in the Highlands of Scot|land, and We&s;tern I&s;les, is called Er&s;e, a dialect of the Iri&s;h, and is &s;uppo&s;ed to be derived from the an|tient Celtic. It abounds with gutturals and na&s;als; is pronounced with a remarkable twang, or ca|dence, and, though not very grateful to the ear, is &s;aid to be expre&s;&s;ive, lofty, and well adapted to poetry.

<P>The pre&s;byterian di&s;cipline and form of church government prevails through all the Highlands, and We&s;tern I&s;lands. The mini&s;ters of a certain di&s;trict con&s;titute a pre&s;bytery, which, at &s;tat|ed meetings, takes cognizance of all ca&s;es of &s;candal, and every thing relating to the kirk, within its own particular province. In matters of great con&s;equence, appeals are made to the &s;ynod, which is held in different quarters of the kingdom, at particular &s;ea&s;ons of the year; but the final re|&s;ource, and regulation of the national church, lies with the general a&s;&s;embly, to which a certain num|ber of lay-elders are admitted, and in which the king's commi&s;&s;ioner pre&s;ides in great &s;tate and magnificence.</P>

<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURE.</HEAD>
<P>The people of this country are generally re|puted idle and lazy; but this lazine&s;s is probably owing to their want of employment, and the means of exerci&s;ing their indu&s;try; for when they &s;ettle in other countries, they become remarkable for their diligence and oeconomy. The commodities which may be deemed the &s;taples of this country, are black cattle, &s;heep, and fi&s;h, which they &s;ell to their fellow-&s;ubjects of Scotland. Part of the wool they work up into knit &s;tockings, coar&s;e cloth, and that variegated &s;tuff called tartan. They likewi&s;e &s;alt mutton in the hide, and export it in boats, or barklings, to different parts of the main land. Cod, ling, mackarel, whiting, had|dock, and &s;oles, are here caught in abundance, together with a &s;mall red cod, remarkably vora|cious, of a very delicate flavour: there are like|wi&s;e two kinds of white fi&s;h, which &s;eem to be peculiar to this coa&s;t, known by the names of lithe and cea, e&s;teemed good eating: but the greate&s;t trea&s;ure the ocean pours forth, is the prodigious quantity of herrings, which, at one &s;ea&s;on of the year, &s;warm in all the creeks and bays along the we&s;tern &s;hore of Scotland. The&s;e are counted the large&s;t, fatte&s;t, and fine&s;t herrings, caught in any part of the Northern Seas. This fi&s;hery employs a great number of hands, and brings a con&s;idera|ble advantage to the kingdom. The fi&s;h are caught, cured, barrelled up, and exported: but whether from want of &s;kill, or a proper &s;alt for pickling, the Scotch-cured herrings of this coa&s;t, though &s;uperior to all others in their natural &s;tate, are counted inferior to tho&s;e which are dre&s;&s;ed and pickled by the Dutch fi&s;hermen.</P>
<P><PB N="442" REF="4610">
How mean and contracted &s;oever the commerce and produce of the&s;e i&s;lands may be at pre&s;ent, they are, perhaps, more capable of improvement, in both articles, than any part of the Briti&s;h domi|nions in Europe. The inhabitants are &s;o little &s;killed in hu&s;bandry, that the &s;oil, though generally good in the low grounds, yields nothing but &s;canty crops of oats and barley; and great tracts of land lie altogether uncultivated. If a very &s;mall num|ber of judicious farmers would &s;ettle in &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable i&s;lands, they would &s;oon rai&s;e &s;uch harve&s;ts as would enrich them&s;elves, employ and maintain all the idle people, a great number of whom are obliged to repair to foreign countries for &s;ub&s;i&s;tence, afford &s;ufficient bread for the inhabitants, and even &s;upply the barren parts of the oppo&s;ite continent. The &s;oil, in many places, would produce wheat, and almo&s;t every where would give good pa&s;turage, in&s;omuch that, with proper culture, the people might provide hay and fodder for their cattle, which, during the &s;everity of the winter, die in great numbers for want of provi&s;ion. Improvements of this kind would be the more ea&s;ily made, as the &s;ea-&s;hore abounds with &s;hells for lime, and &s;ea-weed for ma|nure; and the labourers would be ea&s;ily &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by the fi&s;h that &s;warm, not only in the ocean which &s;urrounds the&s;e i&s;lands, but likewi&s;e in the numerous lakes and rivers of fre&s;h water. Martin declares, that he knew an hundred families in this country maintained by &s;o many little farms, the rent of each not exceeding five &s;hillings, one &s;heep, and a few pecks of oats. We repeat it, therefore, that a few judicious and &s;ub&s;tantial hu&s;bandmen might accumulate large fortunes, by taking long lea&s;es in &s;ome of the We&s;tern I&s;les, in order to improve the wa&s;te land by planting, inclo&s;ing, manuring, and draining. If any family, reduced to low cir|cum&s;tances,
<PB N="443" REF="4620">
can give up the follies and bu&s;tle of life, and enjoy it&s;elf in an agreeable retreat, let it retire to one of the&s;e &s;eque&s;tered i&s;lands, where, at a very incon&s;iderable expence, it may be furni&s;hed with the nece&s;&s;aries, and even comforts of life, amid&s;t the mo&s;t agreeably romantic &s;cenes that di&s;|po&s;e the mind to philo&s;ophical tranquillity, in a pure, &s;alubrious climate, and among a harmle&s;s people, remarkable for innocence of heart, and &s;implicity of manners.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to the commerce of the&s;e i&s;lands, it might be extended &s;o as to render them a &s;taple of trade, and an excellent nur&s;ery for &s;eamen. They are furni&s;hed with an infinite number of bays, creeks, and harbours, for the convenience of na|vigation: the inhabitants are numerous, &s;trong, active, and every way qualified for the life of a mariner. The &s;ea affords myriads of fi&s;h for ex|portation: the lands might afford plenty of pa&s;tur|age for black cattle, hor&s;es, and &s;heep, as well as plenteous harve&s;ts of corn, and other grain: woollen and linnen manufactures might be pro&s;ecuted to great advantage, where labour is cheap and pro|vi&s;ions are rea&s;onable. The i&s;lands afford good &s;tone and lime, and &s;ome parts of the oppo&s;ite main land, timber for building: they have plenty of fuel, not only for the ordinary purpo&s;es of life, but al&s;o for &s;alt-pans, which might be erected on different parts of the coa&s;t; and for burning &s;ea|ware for the u&s;e of a gla&s;s, or &s;oap manufacture. Finally, the &s;ituation of the&s;e i&s;lands is &s;o com|modious for trade, that the navigator is immedi|ately in the open &s;ea, and almo&s;t in the neighbour|hood of Denmark, Sweden, Hamburgh, Holland; nay, with a favourable wind, he can reach the coa&s;ts of France and Spain in a week's &s;ailing; if he is bound for the Briti&s;h plantations, or indeed for any part of the known globe, he is at once di&s;|encumbered

<HEAD>DESCRIPTION OF ST. KILDA.</HEAD>
<P>ST. Kilda, called by the inhabitants Hirt, is a &s;o|litary &s;mall i&s;land, about five miles in circumfe|rence, ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea, in the fifty-eighth de|gree of northern latitude, &s;ixty miles due we&s;t from the middle of the Lewis, which is the ex|treme&s;t range of the Hebrides: but even &s;ixty leagues to the we&s;tward of St. Kilda, the ocean exhibits the rock of Rokol, or Rokabarra. The little i&s;le of Soa lies within half a mile of St. Kil|da on the we&s;t &s;ide, that of Borrera two leagues to the northward, and the rock Levanus, Cackeluc, and Stacknarmin. The whole i&s;land of St. Kilda is one hard rock, divided into four high mountains, thinly covered with black mould, except on the tops, where the &s;oil is three feet deep. The hills are clothed with &s;hort gra&s;s, which yields good pa&s;turage to the hor&s;es, cattle, and &s;heep; and their vallies of arable land give large crops of ex|cellent
<PB N="445" REF="4640">
barley. The whole i&s;land is naturally fen|ced with perpendicular rocks, except at one bay to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, about half a mile broad, where there is generally &s;uch a tumbling &s;urf and raging &s;ea, that no ve&s;&s;el can anchor here with any &s;ecu|rity: the only landing-place is on the north &s;ide of this bay, extremely hazardous; for it is with great difficulty that a boat can be brought to the &s;ide of a &s;lippery rock, on which he that lands mu&s;t jump with uncommon exertion. There is, more|over, a &s;mall bay on the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, in which &s;ome ve&s;&s;els take &s;helter when the wind is at &s;outh, or blows from the north-ea&s;t: but the &s;ea is generally &s;o impetuous all round, that it frequently removes fragments of rocks and &s;tones of a prodigious weight. On the whole, St. Kilda is one of the &s;tronge&s;t natural fortre&s;&s;es in the known world, being inacce&s;&s;ible in every place but at that rock, which might be defended again&s;t any force by loo&s;e &s;tones hurled from the impend|ing mountain of Oterveaul. The i&s;land is well &s;upplied with wells of excellent water, &s;o light and pure, that the &s;tomach u&s;ed to it can hardly af|terwards accommodate it&s;elf to the fine&s;t water of the other i&s;lands: on the we&s;t &s;ide there is a valley or bottom, through the middle of which a rivu|let runs into the &s;ea. On the external part of the i&s;le, towards the &s;outh and north-we&s;t, there are &s;ome natural vaults or arches through which the &s;ea pa&s;&s;es. There is a violent current upon the coa&s;ts of St. Kilda and the le&s;&s;er i&s;les and rocks; and this is more impetuous with the &s;pring tides than at any other time; and the&s;e are always at the full and new moon. No mineral ores have as yet been di&s;covered in St. Kilda; but pieces of chry&s;tal, of an hexangular &s;hape, are found in a bed of &s;and that lies under the rock at the landing|place. In the bottom we have already mentioned,
<PB N="446" REF="4650">
there is a circular edifice built with &s;tone without lime or mortar, ri&s;ing in form of a cone to the top, which is open, and &s;erves as a chimney. It is u&s;ed as a &s;ummer-hou&s;e by the inhabitants, who affirm, from tradition, that it is of great antiquity, and belonged to a famous warlike Amazon. There is a building of the &s;ame kind in one of the neigh|bouring i&s;lands, and may perhaps have been tem|ples dedicated to the god Terminus by the Ro|man general Agricola, who, we know from hi&s;to|ry, embarked on board a fleet, and vi&s;ited the We&s;tern I&s;les of Scotland. Among the plants pro|duced in St. Kilda, we reckon the common dock, the round, large, &s;weet &s;curvy-gra&s;s, millefoil, &s;hepherd's pur&s;e, &s;ilver-weed, plantane, &s;age, chick|weed, &s;orrel, allheal, the &s;ea-pink, tormentil, and mo&s;s of different kinds and di&s;tinctions: but there is neither &s;hrub nor tree on the whole i&s;land. The quadrupeds are hor&s;es, black cattle, &s;heep, goats, and dogs. Of land fowls there are hawks, eagles, plover, land-rails, cuckoos, wrens, and &s;tone-chak|ers. The &s;ea-fowl, which are here innumerable, may be di&s;tingui&s;hed into the&s;e different &s;pecies: the guerfowl, larger than a goo&s;e, of a black co|lour, red about the eyes, with &s;hort wings, and a broad bill, lays a very large &s;potted egg, and hatches it on the bare rock; comes hither about the fir&s;t of May, and departs about the middle of June. The Solan goo&s;e equals the common goo&s;e in &s;ize, and re&s;embles it in &s;hape and colour, with this difference, that the tips of the wings are black, and the top of the head yellow: the bill is long, &s;trait, and crooked at the point; the legs are black and &s;hort, and the bird is web|footed. It comes hither in March, builds its ne&s;t among the rocks with gra&s;s, lays its eggs, hatches its young, and, when they are fledged, retires in Augu&s;t or September. The Solan goo&s;e feeds up|on
<PB N="447" REF="4660">
herring, mackarel, and other fi&s;h, and, going twenty leagues in que&s;t of prey, will &s;tore its craw with herrings for its young, and, upon its return to its ne&s;t, the mate will pull them out as with a pincer. This bird, in order to build its ne&s;t, collects a great heap of gra&s;s, and any other &s;tuff which it finds floating in the &s;ea. The &s;tew|ard of St. Kilda told Martin, that in one ne&s;t he had found a red coat, a bra&s;s &s;un-dial, and an ar|row; and a quantity of Molucca beans in another: nay, Engli&s;h hooks have been found &s;ticking to the bones of fi&s;hes which they had devoured, al|though the&s;e hooks are not u&s;ed within twenty leagues of St. Kilda. It is remarkable that they never pull gra&s;s, except in windy weather, when they cannot employ them&s;elves in fi&s;hing. When they go to roo&s;t at night, they &s;leep with their heads under their wings: but one of the number &s;tands centinel, to prevent &s;urprize. When this bird per|ceives any noi&s;e at a di&s;tance, he calls &s;oftly <HI>grog, grog;</HI> but if he &s;ees the fowler approaching, he cries aloud <HI>bir, bir,</HI> which the re&s;t no &s;ooner hear, than they take wing in a body: if the fowler can &s;ecure this centinel, he catches the re&s;t, as they &s;tand, without difficulty. The&s;e gee&s;e are likewi&s;e caught in gins made of hor&s;e-hair, and in lakes, by floating pieces of wood, on each of which a herring is fixed. The bird no &s;ooner perceives the bait, than he darts upon it with &s;uch force, that he &s;trikes his bill into the board, from whence he cannot di&s;engage it, and thus fixed he is taken. The fulmar is in &s;ize equal to a mall of the &s;econd order, is a grey bird with a white brea&s;t, &s;harp claws, though web-footed, and a thick bill, about two inches long, and crooked at the end. It arrives in the beginning of winter, accompanied by hail, rain, &s;now, and &s;torms at we&s;t. It lays in the be|ginning of May one egg, which is larger than that
<PB N="448" REF="4670">
of the Solan goo&s;e, and the young are ready to fly by the latter end of July. It feeds upon dead and even living whales, and qualifies this food with &s;orrel, which is always found in its ne&s;t; and it di&s;appears during the months of September and October. The young fulmar, when approached by the fowler, &s;quirts from his bill a quantity of pure oil, which he can &s;pout to the di&s;tance of &s;even paces. This oil, which is of a yellowi&s;h colour, is in high e&s;timation among the inhabitants, who catch it in a wooden di&s;h tied to the end of a pole, which they hold before the fulmar. When they &s;urprize him behind, they tie up his bill with a thread until they reach home, where they have a ve&s;&s;el for receiving the oil, which flows out when his jaws are &s;et at liberty. The fle&s;h of the ful|mar they prefer to all other dainties, and indeed it is of a delicate ta&s;te, finely marled with fat and lean intermixed: their young are remarkably fat: the oil is e&s;teemed a catholicon for deep-&s;eated pains and &s;titches, being rubbed on the part affect|ed. Some per&s;ons in this i&s;land u&s;e it as a purge, and &s;ome take it as an emetic, but the operation is &s;evere: certain it is, the oil is hot and penetrat|ing. The &s;craber, puffin, or puffinet, is as large as a pigeon, of a black colour, with a white &s;pot on each wing, and a &s;mall &s;harp bill, with a little curvature at the end. It comes in the month of March, digs a ne&s;t under ground, where it lays its eggs, fi&s;hes all day at &s;ea, picking food from the whale, which, like the fulmar, it eats with &s;orrel, and having hatched and reared their young, which are very fat, they take wing and leave the i&s;land in Augu&s;t. The guillem, guillamot, or lavy, is not quite &s;o large as a duck, with a brown neck and back, white brea&s;t, and &s;trait &s;harp-pointed bill. Their eggs, which are &s;potted, the inhabi|tants u&s;e as ordinary food, and prefer to all others.
<PB N="449" REF="4680">
They come with a &s;outh wind in February: but the time of their departure is uncertain. When this bird remains three days at land without in|termi&s;&s;ion, the natives expect a &s;outherly wind, and fair weather: but their going to &s;ea within that &s;pace, is counted the infallible pre&s;age of a &s;torm. The falk or razor bill is in &s;ize &s;maller than the lavy, of a black colour with a crooked bill, the upper mandible hanging over the lower. It lays a &s;potted egg in May, and is ready to depart with its young by the middle of July. The bow|ger, coulterneb or pope, is a white bird of the &s;ize of a pidgeon, with a &s;hort, broad, triangular bill, red towards the point, which is curved, yel|low feet and blue claws. The&s;e birds arrive with a &s;outh-we&s;t wind about the latter end of March, lay their eggs in holes underground, and hatch their young by the twentieth day of May. The a&s;&s;ilag is a &s;mall bird, not larger than a linnet, with a black, crooked bill, and wide no&s;trils, comes about the end of March, lays its egg about the twentieth of May, produces its young, which is fledged by the middle of October, and departs to|wards the end of November. Here are three &s;orts of &s;ea-mews, of different colours and &s;izes. The &s;ea-pye, which is not web-footed, con&s;equently does not &s;wim, arrives in May, and departs in Augu&s;t. All the &s;ea-fowls, the &s;olan gee&s;e excepted, are perceived to be fatte&s;t during the time of hatch|ing. Before the main body of the &s;olan gee&s;e ar|rives they detach a few harbingers to reconnoitre the i&s;lands, and the&s;e having viewed them with great attention, fly away, as if on purpo&s;e to re|port the ob&s;ervations they have made: in two or three days the whole tribe are &s;een hovering about the coa&s;t; but the inhabitants know not in what country the &s;ea-fowls of pa&s;&s;age &s;pend the winter. The guer-fowl and the fulmar lay but one egg in
<PB N="450" REF="4690">
one year: the re&s;t will lay three times, provided their fir&s;t and &s;econd eggs be taken away.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of St. Kilda, amounting to about two hundred &s;ouls, are originally de&s;cended from the people of the Harries and adjacent i&s;les: like the&s;e they &s;peak the Er&s;e language in great purity, and profe&s;s the Chri&s;tian religion in all its primitive &s;implicity. They are provided with three chapels, in one of which there lies upon the altar a &s;mall brazen crucifix, which, though they do not wor&s;hip it, they hold in great venera|tion; but never touch it, except when they &s;wear a &s;olemn oath, or incur the matrimonial obliga|tion. They ob&s;erve the fe&s;tivals of Chri&s;tmas, Ea&s;ter, Good-Friday, St. Columba, and All Saints. On this la&s;t they perform an anniver&s;ary cavalcade: the whole number of their hor&s;es does not exceed twenty: the&s;e they mount and ride by turns, u&s;ing neither &s;addle nor bridle of any kind, ex|cept a &s;traw rope with which the bea&s;t is ma|naged. The marriage ceremony is performed by the officer who pre&s;ides over them, and is ex|tremely &s;imple. He convenes all the inhabitants of both &s;exes, and demands in public whether they know any lawful impediment that &s;hould prevent the match of the man and woman, who de&s;ire to be married. They an&s;wering in the negative, he a&s;ks the parties if they are contented to live to|gether in weal and woe, as man and wife. When they &s;ignify their a&s;&s;ent he declares them married, and the bride and bridegroom putting their hands upon the crucifix &s;olemnly promi&s;e in the pre&s;ence of Almighty God, to be true to one another. Af|ter this ceremony the wedding is celebrated with mu&s;ic, dancing, and fea&s;ting. The officer al&s;o bap|ti&s;es the children, on which occa&s;ion &s;uch a friend|&s;hip en&s;ues between the parent and &s;pon&s;or or god|father, as no accident can di&s;&s;olve. The natives
<PB N="451" REF="4700">
of this i&s;land, of both &s;exes, are remarkably fair and well featured: the men are delicately propor|tioned, healthy, and reputed &s;tronger than any other i&s;landers belonging to the Hebrides. They marry very young, and their children are &s;uckled two years. They u&s;e proper exerci&s;e, and are very temperate in diet; yet here are few in&s;tances of longevity. Their eye-&s;ight is remarkably keen: their under&s;tanding is &s;olid. They are &s;en&s;ible, hone&s;t, cha&s;te, and ho&s;pitable; very circum&s;pect in traffic, and united in intere&s;t: they are fond of poetry and mu&s;ic, though they have no other in|&s;trument than the jews-harp, and their voices are naturally clear, though they are &s;aid to improve them by &s;wallowing the raw eggs of the &s;olan goo&s;e. With re&s;pect to their manners they are a model of innocence and &s;implicity; and perhaps the happine&s;s of the golden age was never &s;o much realized as in St. Kilda. Unknown to envy and ambition, ignorant of luxury and vice, and remote from the contention, the turmoils and di&s;appoint|ments of life, they obtain the nece&s;&s;aries of na|ture without money, of which they are wholly de&s;|titute: they enjoy health of body, peace of mind, and nothing is wanting to their felicity, but their knowing the mi&s;ery and vexation to which their fellow creatures are expo&s;ed. They have no idea of any prince more powerful than their ma&s;ter the laird of Macleod, who being proprietor of the i&s;land, be&s;tows the &s;teward&s;hip of it upon one of his friends or adherents. This &s;uperintendant vi|&s;its the i&s;land every &s;ummer in order to collect the rents, which are paid in barley, fowls, and fea|thers; and during the time of his re&s;idence upon it, which continues from the begining of &s;um|mer until the &s;olan gee&s;e are ready to fly, he and his retinue are maintained at the expence of the inhabitants by a daily allowance of mutton, &s;ea|fowl,
<PB N="452" REF="4710">
eggs, milk, butter, chee&s;e, oatmeal, and barley. A native of St. Kilda being removed out of his own narrow world, is lo&s;t in a maze of a&s;|toni&s;hment. One of them landing on the large i&s;le of Harries, and a&s;king who was proprietor of all the&s;e exten&s;ive lands: when he under&s;tood they belonged to Macleod, he lifted up his hands and eyes in amazement; but when he afterwards travelled to the i&s;le of Sky, and was told this al&s;o belonged to the &s;ame per&s;on, he could not help exclaiming in a tran&s;port, <Q>&startq;O mighty prince! who art ma&s;ter of &s;uch immen&s;e territories.&endq;</Q> He was &s;truck with wonder at the &s;ight of looking|gla&s;&s;es and pictures, which he imagined were the effect of enchantment: he admired the growth and beauty of trees, which he had never &s;een in his own country; and &s;eeing the oppo&s;ite main|land of Inverne&s;s &s;hire, enquired if that was the border of England.</P>
<P>In the year 1746, when &s;ome ve&s;&s;els repaired to St. Kilda in que&s;t of the young pretender, the in|habitants had heard nothing of him, or the pro|gre&s;s he had made, and knew no further of the times, than that the laird of Macleod was at war with the French king. A native of St. Kilda, having been conveyed by water from Harries to Gla&s;gow, was a&s;toni&s;hed at the length of the voyage; but when he entered that city &s;eemed like one dropped from the clouds. The language of the people, their dre&s;s, and numbers, filled him with amazement. He could not imagine that the hou&s;es were made by the hands of men: when he &s;aw a coach he gaped with admiration; but wondered mo&s;t at the mechani&s;m of the wheel, the motion of which he could not comprehend. The great church, which is a gothic cathedral, he &s;uppo&s;ed to be a natural rock, and ob&s;erved that there were &s;ome &s;till higher in St. Kilda, though
<PB N="453" REF="4720">
he never &s;aw caves &s;o regular and beautiful as tho&s;e formed by the pillars and arches within. He believed that the ladies who wore ma&s;ks had been guilty of &s;ome atrocious crime, in con&s;equence of which they were a&s;hamed to &s;hew their faces. Patches he &s;uppo&s;ed to be &s;pots remaining after bli&s;ters; &s;ilk dre&s;s in women he deemed indecent: he looked upon earings as of all things the mo&s;t ridiculous; laughed at periwigs, and &s;till more at powder. When the church bells rang he was &s;eized with con&s;ternation, as if the whole fabric of the univer&s;e had been in di&s;order. In a word, he condemned, not without judgment, every &s;u|perfluity he &s;aw, and pa&s;&s;ionately longed to re|vi&s;it his own country. The people of St. Kilda are immediately under the direction of an officer or mayor, whom they them&s;elves choo&s;e with the approbation of the &s;teward. His bu&s;ine&s;s is to adju&s;t the re&s;pective proportion of land among the inhabitants, according to the lea&s;e granted by the &s;teward; to repre&s;ent the grievances of the community, and plead in their behalf before Mac|leod or his &s;ub&s;titute; to pre&s;ide in their councils, determine their di&s;putes, maintain the impartiality of the lots by which they &s;hare their booty of eggs and wild-fowl, impo&s;e fines for faults, which the &s;teward either exacts or forgives at his arrival, admi|ni&s;ter oaths on the crucifix, and perform the cere|monies of marriage and bapti&s;m. By virtue of his office, he is obliged in point of honour to ex|po&s;e him&s;elf to the greate&s;t danger in managing the boat, and climbing the rocks in que&s;t of booty. As a compen&s;ation for his trouble, and the perqui|&s;ites of his office, the &s;teward gratifies him with an extraordinary proportion of acres, with his own bonnet when he leaves the I&s;land; on which occa|&s;ion the &s;teward's wife compliments the officer's

<P>The inhabitants live together in a &s;mall village, &s;ituated in a bottom among hills, and compo&s;ed of low wretched cottages, the thatch and roof be|ing &s;ecured by &s;traw-ropes, with &s;tones hang|ing at the end of them. The number of &s;heep on this and the neighbouring i&s;lands, may amount to two thou&s;and: and their cows, which are very &s;mall, do not exceed one hundred. All the animals on the main land, including dogs, cats, and even wild-fowl, are &s;potted. Their arable land is divided into ten equal parts, and the&s;e again are &s;ubdivided, according to the number of fa|milies. They manure the land with a compo&s;t of turf-a&s;hes, mixed with &s;traw and urine, and add to this the bones and intrails of the &s;ea-fowl. They plough with a &s;mall crooked in&s;trument; &s;ow their barley very thick, and reap an harve&s;t of twenty-fold. The &s;ea-coa&s;t furni&s;hes them with plenty of cod, ling, mackarel, turbot, herring, and all the other &s;pecies of fi&s;h common to the &s;ea; here are likewi&s;e otters and &s;eals: but their chief dependance for food, and profit, is upon the &s;ea|fowl, which they catch in many different ways; but this employment &s;ubjects them to the mo&s;t imminent dangers; for they are obliged to climb rocks, the very &s;ight of which, to a &s;tranger, fills him with horror. They have attained to &s;uch a wonderful dexterity in this exerci&s;e, that they will run along the face of a rock, where a goat would hardly find footing. A native of St. Kilda will turn his back to a mountain, almo&s;t perpendicular, and mount to the top upon his knees and elbows, to the terror and a&s;toni&s;hment of the &s;pectator, who has rever before &s;een this feat performed: but the mo&s;t dangerous of all their exploits, is
<PB N="455" REF="4740">
that of climbing the Stack-donn, which ri&s;es like a &s;teeple between the We&s;t point of St. Kilda, and the i&s;le of Soar. Every part of it appears un&s;ur|mountable; but that which is called the Thumb, is &s;o difficult, that the climber mu&s;t poi&s;e him&s;elf upon his thumb for the &s;pace of a minute, during which he has no other hold with his hands or feet, and is obliged to rai&s;e up his body with a &s;pring to the &s;harp point of a rock; which, when he can gra&s;p, he climbs him&s;elf out of danger: by the help of a long rope tied round his middle, he then draws up his companions one after an|other. He receives four fowls above his propor|tion, as a recompence for his valour and activity; and is ever after honoured as one of the heroes of St. Kilda. Notwith&s;tanding all their dexterity and addre&s;s in climbing, they &s;ometimes lo&s;e their lives by falling from the rocks; and then they are lamented in &s;ongs by their relations and neigh|bours. One man in traver&s;ing the face of a rock was caught by the foot in a hor&s;e-hair g$n, which had been placed for the de&s;truction of the wild fowl, and hung with his head downwards over a &s;teep precipice for &s;everal hours; until, at length, a per&s;on hearing his cries came to his relief, and drew him up by the legs. The natives are taught to climb from their childhood, and encouraged to emulation by the con&s;tant di&s;|cour&s;e of both &s;exes, who are &s;till recounting the exploits of their ance&s;tors, for the purpo&s;e of climbing. The community is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of three ropes, each twenty-four fathoms in length; the&s;e are covered with thongs of cow-hide &s;alted, to pre&s;erve them from being cut by the rocks; and joined together occa&s;ionally, according to the height of the rock on which they are to be u&s;ed. The commonwealth has but one boat about &s;ix|teen cubits long, which &s;erves them in all their
<PB N="456" REF="4750">
expeditions of fi&s;hing and fowling. It is divided into different &s;paces, proportioned to the divi&s;ion of the lands and rocks po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by every individual, and in the&s;e &s;paces the re&s;pective owners &s;tow their own booty. There was but one &s;teel and tinder|box in the whole community, until Martin taught them to &s;trike fire with a piece of chry&s;tal and the back of a knife. When a native of St. Kilda has caught a con&s;iderable number of fowls, he &s;its down on the &s;ummit of the rock, and plucking the fatte&s;t, brings them home to his wife or mi&s;|tre&s;s. A batchelor, in making his addre&s;&s;es to a female, is obliged to exhibit a &s;pecimen of his courage and agility; as a proof of his affection, he a&s;cends the top of a perpendicular precipice, about forty fathoms high, and &s;tanding on the extreme&s;t verge on his left foot, half of which is over the rock, he brings his right heel to his left toe, and bending his body, joins his two fi&s;ts to the point of his right foot. When the boat breaks from its fa&s;tenings, or is &s;tove to pieces on the rocks, the men that chance to be on board or landed, are &s;ometimes reduced to great di&s;tre&s;s. Twenty natives of St. Kilda, from an accident of this kind, were left &s;everal days on the rock Stack Warmin, and their lives were &s;aved by the in|genuity of one individual, who made fi&s;hing hooks $om the handles of their knives, by beating them on a &s;tone, and working with the blade and handle of dagger. The&s;e occa&s;ional hooks they fa&s;tened to &s;ome &s;orry lines, and baiting them with limpets, $Span$ fi&s;h &s;ufficent for their maintenance. Nine of the St. Kilda men having made a voyage to the $Word$ of Borrera for a cargo of fowl and eggs, had the misfortune to lo&s;e their boar, and were confined $$ this exile without a cru&s;t of bread, from the $Word$ of March, till the latter end of May. Their wives and countrymen &s;uppo&s;ed they had
<PB N="457" REF="4760">
all peri&s;hed, and their fate was celebrated in &s;ongs and lamentations as a grievous national calamity. At length the nine exiles bethought them&s;elves of an expedient to inform their friends of their being alive: they kindled nine di&s;tinct fires at night on the top of an eminence: the&s;e were no &s;ooner perceived, and the number of lights counted by the inhabitants of St. Kilda, than they perceived the meaning of the au&s;picious &s;ignal, and their &s;orrow forthwith vani&s;hed. The wives of the ab|&s;entees began to labour their grounds with the &s;pade, and Providence ble&s;&s;ed their indu&s;try with a very extraordinary harve&s;t. Meanwhile their hu&s;bands &s;ub&s;i&s;ted on fi&s;h, fowl, and mutton, of which they had plenty in Borrera, until the &s;teward arrived at St. Kilda; when being made acquainted with their fate, he &s;ent his own boat to bring them home. Nothing could be more affecting than the mutual tran&s;ports of joy which were ex|pre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e poor creatures, their wives, rela|tions, and countrymen, when they were re&s;tored to their native i&s;land, after &s;uch a di&s;agreeable exile. The tender pa&s;&s;ions reign here in full empire, without any ferocity; envy, ambition, avarice, jealou&s;y, and revenge, have no &s;cope nor field for exerci&s;e on this contracted &s;cene. The people, bred up in innocent and &s;ocial affection, are mild, &s;edate, compa&s;&s;ionate, and humane. They relieve all &s;trangers to the utmo&s;t of their power, with|out re&s;pect to country, without any hope of re|compen&s;e, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who have the misfor|tune to &s;uffer &s;hipwreck. Per&s;ons in &s;uch di&s;tre&s;s they con&s;ider as objects immediately recommended by Providence to their friend&s;hip and a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and the&s;e they entertain with a warmth of ho&s;pi|tality, which does honour to human nature. They look upon it as their duty to perform the&s;e good office to their fellow-creatures, even after having &s;u&s;|tained
<PB N="458" REF="4770">
repeated acts of ingratitude, violence, and brutality from mariners, who have plundered their hou&s;es, and deflowered their virgins. In con&s;e|quence of &s;uch in&s;ults, however, they have laid down a re&s;olution to allow no more than ten men, and the&s;e unarmed, to land at one time from any &s;hip or ve&s;&s;el.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of St. Kilda are but meanly habited in the Highland fa&s;hion. They wear ho&s;e made of coar&s;e cloth, but no &s;hoes in &s;ummer: their &s;hirts are of coar&s;e flannel, which they put off when they go to bed. The ordinary &s;hoes and &s;tockings of the women con&s;i&s;t of the necks of Solan gee&s;e, which they &s;lit open towards the brea&s;t; &s;o that the foot is thru&s;t down into it, and the creature's head &s;erves for the heel of the &s;hoe; this contrivance, however, is &s;o &s;light, that they mu&s;t have fre&s;h &s;hoes every five days. The&s;e people eat bread made of barley and oatmeal: they feed on mutton, beef, fi&s;h, wild fowl, and their eggs, and eat all their food without &s;alt: they are particularly fond of the fat of their fowls, which they call giben; this they u&s;e in all their &s;auces, and apply externally to wounds and brui&s;es. In &s;hort, it is their chief delicacy, and &s;o agreeable to their &s;tomachs, that a native of St. Kilda re|moved to another country where it cannot be ob|tained, pines for his giben; the want of which &s;ometimes intails upon him a dangerous di&s;temper, in the &s;ame manner as the Greenlanders and Zem|blans pine for train oil. With this giben, u&s;ed in&s;tead of butter, the St. Kilda people eat the &s;ea plant dul&s;e and &s;lake, the roots of dock and &s;ilver-weed boiled, as well as &s;tewed &s;curvy-gra&s;s, which in this i&s;land grows large, &s;weet, and &s;avoury. They &s;alt their chee&s;e with the a&s;hes of &s;ea-ware, and pre&s;erve the eggs of their &s;ea-fowl in the a&s;hes of turf: thus &s;ecured they will keep fre&s;h
<PB N="459" REF="4780">
for &s;ix, &s;even, and eight months. The&s;e eggs they eat in great numbers with a keen appetite, though to &s;trangers they prove co&s;tive and feveri&s;h. The number allotted as a daily maintenance to the crew of two boats, amounted in three weeks to &s;ixteen thou&s;and. They pre&s;erve their Solan gee&s;e a whole year without &s;alt, by &s;litting them down the back, and depo&s;iting them in &s;tone pyramids, of which they have built above five hundred on the tops of rocks and mountains in this and the neighbouring i&s;lands. Of the&s;e birds the i&s;landers con&s;ume about three and twenty thou&s;and annual|ly. Their ordinary drink is water or whey; yet upon extraordinary occa&s;ions they brew a kind of ale, fermented with the juice of nettle roots, and a kind of &s;our flummery made from barley meal. The men of St. Kilda amu&s;e them&s;elves in play|ing at a game of ball with wooden clubs, in leap|ing, &s;wimming, and climbing. The women a&s;|&s;emble in the middle of the village, where they di&s;cour&s;e of their affairs, joke, &s;ing, and make ver&s;es, &s;pinning all the time at their di&s;taffs. They are much addicted to &s;uper&s;titious charms, and &s;ome of them pretend to have the &s;econd &s;ight. The di&s;ea&s;e to which they are chiefly &s;ub|ject is the drop&s;y, in all probability owing to their gro&s;s feeding on the rancid oil of animals without &s;alt. When they are &s;eized with this di&s;|temper their appetites fail, their feet begin to totter, their faces grow red, bloated, and break out in pimples, the voice becomes hoar&s;e, the re&s;piration difficult, the hair falls off the crown of the head, and this is &s;oon covered with a kind of ulceration. Martin &s;agaciou&s;ly advi&s;ed one of the&s;e lepers to take example from the Fulmar, which qualifies his whale's fle&s;h with &s;orrel, to eat plenty of vegetables, ab&s;tain from the giben and fat fowls, and exerci&s;e him&s;elf every morning and
<PB N="460" REF="4790">
evening in climbing to the top of the high moun|tains Connagor. By following the&s;e directions, he in a few days recovered his appetite and voice, which he had almo&s;t lo&s;t, and was left in a fair way of recovery.</P>

<HEAD>Of the SECOND SIGHT.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;econd &s;ight, called tai&s;h in the Er&s;e lan|guage, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;upernatural faculty of &s;eeing vi&s;ions of events before they happen. This &s;pirit of prophecy, if we may believe Martin, is be&s;towed by heaven upon many individuals in all the inhabited we&s;tern i&s;lands of Scotland, and particularly in the i&s;le of Skie; and indeed the delu&s;ion is &s;o remarkable, that this author, in other re&s;pects a man of &s;en&s;e, learning, and cha|racter, relates &s;ome &s;urpri&s;ing in&s;tances of the tai&s;h on his own knowledge, and many others on the credit of &s;uch evidence, as in matters of an ordinary nature could not be doubted. It is after him that we &s;hall make the following remarks for the amu&s;ement of the reader. During this pre|ternatural communication, the &s;eer's eyes are &s;eem|ingly fixed and rivetted upon a vacant &s;pace, and his eye-lids rai&s;ed and di&s;torted as if he were in|tranced. If a vi&s;ion is &s;een early in the morn|ing, it will be reali&s;ed in a few hours; if at noon, it will happen that very day; if in the evening, probably that night; if after candles are lighted, it will certainly be accompli&s;hed before morning. Yet &s;everal times the &s;eer has vi&s;ions of circum|&s;tances that do not occur for whole weeks, months, and even years, after this intimation. When the image of a per&s;on appears in a &s;hroud, the man or woman &s;o repre&s;ented will certainly die &s;ooner or later, according to the manner in which the &s;hroud is put on: if it reaches no higher than the
<PB N="461" REF="4800">
middle, the de&s;tined victim may live &s;ome months, and even &s;urvive the end of the year; but if it a&s;cends towards the head, death is &s;uppo&s;ed to be at hand. Before a man's marriage, his future wife is often &s;een &s;tanding at his left-hand: the vi&s;ion of a &s;tranger is &s;een before his arrival, and accu|rately de&s;cribed by the &s;eer, though he had never heard of his name, and was quite ignorant of his coming. Martin declares, that he him&s;elf had been frequently &s;een at the di&s;tance of an hundred miles, by &s;eers of both &s;exes, with whom he had no per&s;onal acquaintance. A &s;park of fire &s;een to fall upon a man's arm or brea&s;t, is counted a &s;ure pre&s;age of a dead child. A &s;eat appearing empty while a per&s;on actually &s;its in it, is reckon|ed an infallible &s;ign of that per&s;on's approaching death. When a novice &s;ees a vi&s;ion without doors in the night, he no &s;ooner approaches a fire but he faints away. Vi&s;ions are not vi&s;ible to dif|ferent &s;eers when they chance to be together, until he who &s;ees the object touches his brethren; then it is perceived by the brethren. The &s;econd &s;ight is not confined to men, women, and children, but extends al&s;o to cows and hor&s;es, as appears by a very uncommon agitation in &s;ome of the&s;e animals, while the &s;eer contemplates his vi&s;ion. The&s;e people likewi&s;e pretend to foretel events by the &s;en&s;es of hearing and &s;melling. They hear loud cries re&s;embling the voice of &s;ome particular per&s;on, who&s;e death is thus &s;ignified: they fore|&s;mell fle&s;h or fi&s;h boiling or broiling, at the time when neither is in the hou&s;e, nor likely to be pur|cha&s;ed. Among a variety of incidents narrated by our Highland philo&s;opher, we &s;hall recite a few for their ridiculous &s;ingularity. A man in Lewis was haunted by a &s;pirit in his own likene&s;s, who attended him at work in the fields, and teized him with many impertinent que&s;tions: he likewi&s;e
<PB N="462" REF="4810">
appeared to him in his own hou&s;e, but there was always &s;ilent. The poor man, by the advice of a neighbour, to whom he revealed his affliction, threw a live coal at the &s;pirit at its next vi&s;itation. This a&s;&s;ault gave &s;uch offence, that next day in the field he was beaten by it mo&s;t unmercifully, &s;o as to be confined to his bed for a fortnight. An inhabitant of the pari&s;h of St. Mary's, in the i&s;le of Skie, being &s;uddenly taken with a vomit|ing, and falling back on the floor in a &s;ort of a fit, declared upon his recovery, that a certan wo|man, &s;uppo&s;ed to have a pa&s;&s;ion for him, which he treated with neglect, had appeared before him in all the rage and di&s;traction of a &s;lighted woman, pouring cur&s;es, reproaches, and threats, which had terrified him into that di&s;order of mind and body. Some inhabitants of Harries &s;ailing in a boat to the i&s;le of Skie, &s;aw the apparitions of two men hanging from their tackle. When they arrived at Broadford in Skie, they found Sir Do|nal Macdonald holding a &s;heriff's court, at which two criminals being condemned to die, the ropes of their boat were u&s;ed in the execution. Archi|bald Macdonald, in the village of Knockow, told his family one night, that he was troubled with a ridiculous vi&s;ion of a man with a long cap continually &s;haking his head, and bearing in his hand a &s;mall harp of four &s;trings, ornamented with two hart&s;horns. They laughed at his de&s;crip|tion as a fanta&s;tic chimera; but in three or four days the vi&s;ion was realized by the arrival of a &s;tranger buffoon playing upon &s;uch an in&s;trument, with a long cap, to which two bells were affixed; and the&s;e he rang by &s;haking his head, keeping time with the mu&s;ick of the harp, which exactly an&s;wered the de&s;cription of the &s;eer. The &s;ervants of Sir Norman Macleod, being a&s;&s;embled one night in his hall on the i&s;le of Skie, while he him|&s;elf
<PB N="463" REF="4820">
was ab&s;ent, one of them having the &s;econd &s;ight, told his fellow-&s;ervant that they mu&s;t re|move to another place, and leave that apartment to their betters. They were very little di&s;po&s;ed to credit this prediction, con&s;idering the darkne&s;s of the night, and the danger that their ma&s;ter would run from the rocks to which his boat mu&s;t be expo&s;ed. The &s;eer in&s;i&s;ted upon their leaving the hall, and in le&s;s than an hour a me&s;&s;enger ar|rived from the water &s;ide with an account of the laird's having landed. Sir Norman, being in|formed of this incident, examined the &s;eer, who told him that he had &s;een the &s;pirit called Browny in human &s;hape enter the hall, and &s;eem to carry off by neck and heels an old woman &s;ervant, who &s;at by the chimney-corner. Sir Norman playing one day at tables with another gentleman, was at a lo&s;s how to place his piece; and the butler, who &s;tood behind his chair, directed him how to di&s;po&s;e of it: his advice was taken, and his ma&s;ter won the game; but knowing that the butler could not play at tables, he a&s;ked by what means he had &s;tumbled on &s;uch a lucky expedient? The man an&s;wered, that he was directed by the &s;pirit Browny, which he &s;aw reach his hand over his honour's &s;houl|der, and point to the place where the piece was to be entered. This Browny was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a fa|cetious familiar, well known in all parts of Scot|land, re&s;iding in the hou&s;es of gentlemen, where it played a thou&s;and merry pranks for the enter|tainment of the family.</P>
<P>Sixty miles to the we&s;tward of St. Kilda, is the Lewis, or long i&s;land, extending one hundred miles in length from north to &s;outh, and from thirteen to fourteen in breadth, con&s;i&s;ting of a great number of i&s;les and rocks, and parted by the &s;ea into two divi&s;ions, called Lewis and Har|ries; the former lying to the we&s;tward of the
<PB N="464" REF="4830">
other. Lewis belongs to the &s;hire of Ro&s;s; is divided by &s;everal channels, di&s;tingui&s;hed by &s;e|veral names, and portioned out among different proprietors; but the Lewis, &s;trictly &s;o called, &s;tretches about &s;ix and thirty miles in length, from the north point of Bowling head to the &s;outhern extremity of Hu&s;&s;ine&s;s in Harries. The air is temperately cold, moi&s;t, and healthy; great part of the low ground is flooded with lakes; the re&s;t is arable in many places, and has been counted fruitful in oats, barley, rye, flax, and hemp. The &s;oil in the&s;e parts is a light &s;and, which the inhabitants manure with &s;oot and &s;ea|ware; but great part of the i&s;land is covered with heath. The labouring people dig the land with &s;pades, break the clods with &s;mall harrows, the foremo&s;t teeth of which are made of wood, and the remainder of rough heath, which &s;mooths what the others have broke; and this harrow is drawn by one man, having a &s;trong trace of hor&s;e|hair acro&s;s his brea&s;t. Of their corn they not only make malt for ale, but likewi&s;e a &s;trong &s;pirit called <HI>Tre&s;tareg,</HI> which is the whi&s;ky, or u&s;que|baugh, three times di&s;tilled. Lewis abounds with convenient bays and harbours, namely, Loch|&s;tornvay, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, the Birken i&s;les, about &s;even miles farther &s;outhward, Loch-crefort, three miles more to the &s;outh, Loch-&s;eafort about five miles &s;till farther in the &s;ame direction; Loch-Carlvay, a capacious and &s;ecure harbour, about four and twenty miles to the &s;outh-we&s;t, and Loch-rague four miles more &s;outherly on the &s;ame coa&s;t: all the&s;e bays abound with cod, ling, and herring: here are likewi&s;e whales of different &s;izes, which the natives drive into the bays and kill with harpoons. Fifty young whales have been killed on this coa&s;t, in one &s;ea&s;on; and their fle&s;h was eaten by the natives, who count it &s;alu|tary
<PB N="465" REF="4840">
and tooth&s;ome, di&s;tingui&s;hing it by the name of &s;ea-pork. The&s;e bays afford great plenty of &s;hell-fi&s;h; &s;uch as clams, oy&s;ters, cockles, mu&s;&s;els, lympits, wilks; and &s;uch a prodigious quantity of &s;pout-fi&s;h is &s;ometimes ca&s;t up from the &s;and off Loch-tua, that they infect the air, and render it unhealthy to the neighbouring inhabitants, who are not able to con&s;ume them, either by eating, or u&s;ing them as manure for the ground. Some of the&s;e lochs and bays likewi&s;e produce &s;mall coral and coralline. The fre&s;h-water lakes are well &s;tored with trout and eels, and the rivers yield plenty of &s;almon. Along the coa&s;t are found a great number of caves, which &s;erve as &s;helter for the &s;eals and otters, which are al&s;o eaten as dainties by the inhabitants; and va&s;t numbers of &s;ea|fowl build upon the rocks and promontories.</P>
<P>The land animals reared in this i&s;land, are cows, hor&s;es, &s;heep, goats, hogs, and deer; all the&s;e are of a diminutive &s;ize. The beef, mutton, and pork, are juicy and delicious; the hor&s;es are active and hardy; the deer, which are of the red kind, confine them&s;elves to the chace of O&s;er|vaul, about fifteen miles in compa&s;s, which af|fords tolerable pa&s;turage; but in the winter, when the ground is covered with fro&s;t and &s;now, the&s;e animals are forced to feed on &s;ea-ware, and endure all the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on, without any &s;helter from wood or cop&s;e, for there is not a tree to be &s;een; neverthele&s;s, the roots of very large trees, which have been cut by the ax, are found in different places. There is likewi&s;e a &s;mall grove of birch and hazle on the &s;outh-we&s;t &s;ide of Loch-Stornway.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Lewis, are in general well|proportioned, tall, fair, &s;anguine, &s;trong, and healthy. The &s;mall-pox &s;ometimes makes terri|ble havock among them. The other di&s;ea&s;es to

which they are &s;ubject, are the chin-cough in children, the fever, the diarrhaea, dy&s;entery, &s;ore|throats, jaundice, &s;titches, pleuri&s;ies, coughs, and rheums. As a medicine for the diarrhaea and dy&s;entery, they admini&s;ter the kernel of the black Molucca beans, powdered and drank in boiled milk; and &s;ometimes the patient &s;wallows a &s;mall do&s;e of their &s;trong whi&s;ky diluted with water. This is likewi&s;e pre&s;cribed to children in the &s;mall-pox, when the pul&s;e &s;inks and the pu&s;tules do not fill. Inflammatory di&s;orders they cure by repeated bleeding; coughs and colds are removed by drinking plentifully of warm brochan, or water-gruel, with butter or honey, taken at bed time; which not only acts as a bal&s;amic pecto|ral, but wonderfully promotes the di&s;charge of &s;weat and urine. When the uvula is elongated, they &s;nip off part of it with a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars: for the jaundice they &s;luice a pail full of cold water by &s;urprize on the patient's naked back, or &s;ear the vertebrae with an actual cautery, when he dreams of no application. Green wounds they cure with ointments made of vulnerary plants and fre&s;h butter.</P>
<P>The natives of Lewis are quick of apprehen|&s;ion, and ingenious in mechanics, much addicted to poetry and mu&s;ick, many of them learning to play on the bag-pipe and violin. They are in general &s;ober, circum&s;pect, and ho&s;pitable; dex|terous in &s;hooting, &s;wimming, leaping; bold and &s;kilful mariners; and &s;o temperate, that they will tug at the oar all day, without any other provi&s;ion than bread and water, with a &s;nu&s;h of tobacco.</P>
<P>Along this coa&s;t we &s;ee &s;everal natural mounts or forts, called <HI>Dun,</HI> &s;uch as Dunrowly, Dun-co|radel, and Dun-ei&s;ten. There are al&s;o the remains of &s;ome old ca&s;tles, and other monuments of an|tiquity. At Stornvay village we &s;ee the ruins of

a fortre&s;s de&s;troyed by the Engli&s;h garri&s;on &s;ent thither by Oliver Cromwell. To the northward of Brago there is a round tower built of large &s;tones, three &s;tories high, tapering towards the top, with a double wall, and a circular &s;tairca&s;e between, by which one may go quite round the building. On the heaths and &s;ummits of hills there are &s;everal cairns or heaps of &s;tones, which &s;erved either for graves or beacons. In the pari&s;h of Barvas we &s;ee a &s;ingle &s;tone called the Thru&s;hel, &s;tanding upright, above twenty feet high, and almo&s;t as much in breadth. Three &s;tones, about twelve feet high each, are &s;een &s;tanding on the north &s;ide of Loch-Carlvay; and many others &s;tand|ing &s;ingly at great di&s;tances, and in remote parts of the i&s;land. But the mo&s;t remarkable monu|ment of this kind appears by the village of Cla&s;|&s;erni&s;s. Here we find nine and thirty pyramidal &s;tones &s;tanding upright, about &s;ix or &s;even feet high from the &s;urface, each about two feet in breadth. They are placed in form of an avenue, eight feet wide; the di&s;tance between every &s;tone amounting to &s;ix feet, and a &s;ingle piece &s;tands at the entrance. This avenue leads to a circle of twelve &s;tones of the &s;ame dimen&s;ions, with one in the center thirteen feet in length, and &s;haped like a rudder: on the ea&s;t, &s;outh, and we&s;t &s;ides of this circle, are four &s;tones, &s;uch as tho&s;e that compo&s;e this round and avenue, forming three lines, or as it were rays, from the body of the circle. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been a Druid temple; and tradition reports, that the chief Druid &s;tood by the large &s;tone in the center, and harrangued the audience. At the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile there is another circle of the &s;ame nature; but, without the range and avenue. In all proba|bility, the&s;e, as well as the monuments we have de&s;cribed in our account of the Orkneys, and

Stone henge on Sali&s;bury-plain, were places of wor&s;hip erected by the Danes in the time of pagan &s;uper&s;tition. The chief town in Lewis is called Storn-Bay, from its &s;ituation at the head of the bay, known by this name: it is a village, con&s;i&s;t|ing of about &s;ixty families, with a church, a gram|mar-&s;chool, and &s;ome public-hou&s;es: here al&s;o re&s;ides the &s;teward for the laird of Mackleod, who is proprietor of the i&s;land.</P>
<P>There is a con&s;iderable number of inferior ad|jacent i&s;les and rocks, &s;ome of which hardly de|&s;erve to be mentioned; &s;uch as the &s;mall i&s;land Garve, at the mouth of Loch Carlvay, Berin&s;ay, Fladda, Bernera minor, and Bernera major, Kia$i&s;y, Cavay, Carvay, Grenim, Pabay, Shirem, Vexay, Wuya the larger and le&s;&s;er, and the Flan|nan i&s;lands, which the &s;eamen denominate the northern hunters. The&s;e are vi&s;ited every &s;um|mer by the inhabitants of the Lewis, who go thither in que&s;t of fowls, eggs, down, quills, and feathers, as well as to &s;heer or kill the &s;heep that are kept here for pa&s;ture. As the&s;e i&s;lands are very &s;teep and rocky, the vi&s;iters, after having landed and climbed up the rock by a ladder, un|cover their heads, and making a turn &s;un-ways, thank God for having e&s;caped the danger they have undergone. In the large&s;t i&s;land are the ruins of a chapel dedicated to St. Flannan, from whom the i&s;les derive their name. Thither the fowlers repairing, &s;trip them&s;elves of their upper garments, which being laid upon a &s;tone, they advance towards the altar, and repeat three prayers; an exerci&s;e which is performed every morning and evening. They ob&s;erve many other &s;uper&s;titious cu&s;toms during their re&s;idence on the&s;e rocks; and when they have landed their boat with their purcha&s;e, return to the larger i&s;lands. Among the i&s;lands belonging to the Lewis, we may like|wi&s;e

take notice of the &s;mall i&s;le of Pigmies, &s;o called, becau&s;e bones re&s;embling tho&s;e of human creatures, but of very &s;mall dimen&s;ions, have here been dug out of the ground. Dependant al&s;o upon Lewis, is the i&s;land Rona, about two miles in circuit, at the di&s;tance of twenty leagues from the north-ea&s;t point of Ne&s;s in Lewis. It was formerly inhabited by five families of natives, who lived in the mo&s;t amicable &s;implicity; igno|rant of vice, unacquainted with venality, having neither gold nor &s;ilver; but bartering the pro|duce of their farms for the little nece&s;&s;aries of life, which their indu&s;try could not otherwi&s;e &s;up|ply. Their hou&s;es were built of large &s;tones, thatched with &s;traw; the roofs being &s;ecured with ropes of the &s;ame &s;tuff, poi&s;ed with &s;tones, to pre|vent the tenement's being blown away. In this i&s;land there is a chapel dedicated to St. Ronan, where every Sunday morning the natives a&s;&s;embled, and repeated the Lord's prayer with the ten com|mandments, this being the &s;um of their religious di&s;cipline. They wore the &s;ame habit, and &s;poke the &s;ame language that is u&s;ed by the other High|landers. They admired greyhounds, and were a&s;toni&s;hed at the &s;ight of a hor&s;e, the neighing of which they mi&s;took for laughter. They were ex|tremely ho&s;pitable, and imagined them&s;elves po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of the gift of &s;econd &s;ight; which is in effect a pretence to fore&s;ight or prophecy, by &s;ee|ing apparitions of what will happen. The recep|tion which, according to Martin, they gave to Mr. Daniel Morri&s;on, mini&s;ter of Barvas, to who&s;e living their i&s;land belonged, was truly primitive and benevolent. <Q>Upon his landing, the natives ad|dre&s;&s;ed him to this effect: &startq;God &s;ave you, pilgrim, you are heartily welcome; we have had repeated apparitions of your per&s;on among us, and we heartily congratulate your arrival in this remote

country.&endq;</Q> Then they conducted him to their village, where he was &s;aluted by every individual inhabitant, and introduced into the hou&s;e a&s;&s;igned for his lodging, where he found a bundle of &s;traw laid on the floor for an ea&s;y &s;eat. After &s;ome con|&s;ultation, they left him to his repo&s;e, and the head of every family killed a &s;heep for his entertain|ment. <Q>The &s;kins being flayed off entire from the neck to the tail in form of a &s;ack, they filled them with barley-meal, of which they made a pre&s;ent to the mini&s;ter, while one of them har|rangued him in the&s;e words: &startq;Pilgrim, we are very &s;en&s;ible of the favour you have done us, in coming &s;o far, and venturing your life on the great ocean, purely with a de&s;ign to in&s;truct us in the way to happine&s;s; be plea&s;ed to accept of this &s;mall pre&s;ent, which we humbly offer as an expre&s;&s;ion of our &s;incere e&s;teem and affec|tion.&endq;</Q> This little, harmle&s;s community was afterwards de&s;troyed in con&s;equence of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive misfortunes. A &s;warm of rats, from whence no man could tell, landed upon the i&s;land, and de|voured all their corn. Some barbarous &s;eamen rowing a&s;hore robbed them of their bull; and during a whole year, they received no &s;upply from Lewis. It is not improbable that &s;ome pi|ratical &s;hip-ma&s;ter kidnapped the majority of the natives, otherwi&s;e they mu&s;t have died of famine; which was evidently the ca&s;e with a poor forlorn woman, who with a child lying on her brea&s;t, was found dead at the &s;ide of a rock, by the &s;tew|ard of St. Kilda, who happened to be driven into Rona by &s;tre&s;s of weather. In a few years after the extinction of this antient race, the mini&s;ter &s;ent a rew colony to the i&s;land with &s;uitable &s;up|plies. Four leagues to the ea&s;tward of Rona, appears the rock Souli&s;her, ri&s;ing out of the &s;ea, and almo&s;t covered with &s;ea-fowl; among which

we reckon the Solan goo&s;e, the guillamote, the coulter-neb, the puffin, and the bird called colk, &s;omewhat &s;maller than a goo&s;e, covered with down, and variegated feathers, with a tuft like that of a peacock on its head, and a tail longer than the train of a hou&s;e-cock: the hen, however, is not &s;o gaudily adorned. The i&s;land Scant, or as the natives call it <HI>More,</HI> lies about a league to the ea&s;tward of U&s;hine&s;s in Lewis, and in fact con&s;i&s;ts of three i&s;lands, &s;eparated by &s;pring-tides, or &s;mall channels, and about two miles in circum|ference. In one of the&s;e there is a chapel dedi|cated to the Virgin Mary; the &s;oil is here fruitful of corn and gra&s;s; but the others produce nothing but a &s;canty pa&s;turage. The lea&s;t of the&s;e is &s;ur|rounded with high rocks, &s;o as to be inacce&s;&s;ible, except in one place, where there is a natural &s;tair|ca&s;e in the rock, which might be defended by a few men again&s;t a whole army. Here Martin &s;aw two eagles, which the natives a&s;&s;ured him would not &s;uffer any other birds of the &s;ame &s;pecies to re&s;ide on that i&s;land. They were never known to make prey of any thing belonging to the people among whom they lived; though the natives had often found in and about their ne&s;ts the bones of wild fowl, fawns, and lambs, which they had killed in &s;ome of the neighbouring i&s;lands.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands of Lewis are divided into the two pari&s;hes of Barvas and Eye, and in each of the&s;e one mini&s;ter is &s;ettled; but there is a great num|ber of churches and chapels dedicated to different &s;aints, in the different i&s;les which compo&s;e this clu&s;ter. All the&s;e were &s;anctuaries before the Re|formation, but now they are dive&s;ted of that pri|vilege. The people of the&s;e i&s;lands are pre&s;by|terians, with a few prote&s;tants of the Engli&s;h com|munion, and a &s;till &s;maller number of Roman ca|tholics. The prote&s;tants ob&s;erve the fe&s;tivals of

Chri&s;tmas, Good Friday, Ea&s;ter and Michaelmas; on the la&s;t of which the individuals of both &s;exes perform an anniver&s;ary cavalcade.</P>
<P>The i&s;le of Harries, &s;eparated by a channel from Lewis, extends about four and twenty miles in length, and in &s;ome places about &s;ix miles in breadth. The air and climate are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Lewis: the face of the ground is rocky, and mountainous, covered with gra&s;s and heath: on the we&s;t &s;ide, however, the land is more flat and arable, producing naturally abundance of clover and dai&s;y, which in the &s;ummer perfume the air with an agreeable fragrance. The &s;oil is dry and &s;andy; but when manured with &s;ea-ware, yields very great harve&s;ts of oats, rye, and barley. There are divers fre&s;h water lakes in this i&s;land, abounding with trout, eels, and &s;almon; the over|plus of every lake being di&s;charged into the &s;ea, by an agreeable &s;erpentine river. The i&s;land is al&s;o furni&s;hed with &s;ome excellent &s;prings i&s;&s;uing from the mountains, as well as with &s;everal foun|tains, which are found to contain medicinal vir|tues. There is one well near the village of Borve, the water of which proves efficacious in the cholic, &s;titches, and the gravel: there is another on the ea&s;tern coa&s;t, near Mervag-hou&s;es, remarkable for re&s;toring lo&s;t appetites; but the waters of the w$lls d$g in plains near the &s;ea, is bracki&s;h and unwhol&s;ome.</P>
<P>The be&s;t harbour in Harries lies within the land, and is called Scalpa by the natives; but known by the name of Gla&s;s among the &s;ea-faring men. There are divers other commodious havens formed by inlets of the &s;ea, called lochs; &s;uch as $$ch Ta$b$$, loch Stokene&s;s, loch Fini&s;bay; which la&s;t is an excellent harbour, though little known: over and above the&s;e there are many convenien$ creek$, affording &s;ecure anchorage to $Word$ and &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. Harries produces the

&s;ame animals we have de&s;cribed in our account of Lewis, the &s;ame little birds, fi&s;hes, and amphibi|ous creatures, with the addition of the mertrick, a quadruped about the &s;ize of a cat, with a fine va|luable fur of a brown colour: the number of deer that run wild among the hills and mountains of this i&s;land amounts to two thou&s;and; no per&s;on is allowed to hunt them, without a licence from the fore&s;ter; and there is one particular &s;pot of ground re&s;erved for the laird of Mackleod him&s;elf, who is always &s;ure to find game enough when he is di&s;po&s;ed for this diver&s;ion: yet in this fore&s;t, or in the whole i&s;land, there is neither tree nor &s;hrub, except the heath, for the &s;helter of the&s;e poor animals. Here are two &s;orts of eagles, which do abundance of mi&s;chief among the flocks of &s;heep, deer, and poultry; and excellent hawks breed among the rocks of this i&s;land. No towns of any con&s;e|quence are &s;een on this, or any other of the He|brides; but here we find &s;ome populous villages, the chief of which are Borve and Rowdil. The country pre&s;ents the view of &s;everal Dani&s;h monu|ments made with &s;tones &s;tanding erect, round towers, and kairns, &s;uch as we have de&s;cribed in the former article: there are likewi&s;e divers arti|ficial caves on each &s;ide of the coa&s;t, &s;ome of which are very &s;trong, and almo&s;t impregnable by na|ture. The large&s;t and mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e is in the middle of a high rock on the hill of Ulweal, capable of containing fifty men, fur|ni&s;hed with two wells of water; and &s;o difficult of acce&s;s, that one man with a &s;taff in his hand may defend it again&s;t a thou&s;and a&s;&s;ailants; for one only can enter at a time, and he mu&s;t employ his hands in clambering, without being able to manage any &s;ort of offen&s;ive weapon. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the village of Rowdil, we &s;ee a circular &s;tone tower, about two &s;tories high, and three fathom under water: there is &s;uch another, but of &s;maller
<PB N="474" REF="4930">
dimen&s;ions, on the other &s;ide of the bay. In all probability, the &s;ea has gained upon the land in many places; for in the&s;e i&s;lands, fragments of old walls, and roots of large trees, have been di&s;covered within low-water mark: perhaps this kind of &s;ub&s;idence may have been the effect of earthquakes.</P>
<P>The &s;hore on the we&s;t coa&s;t of Harries affords a variety of curious &s;hells, <HI>Tellinae, Turbines, Pa|tellae, Pictines,</HI> Molucca beans, and great quan|tities of the <HI>Os Sepiae.</HI> This la&s;t the natives take in powder with boiled milk, as an effectual re|medy for the diarrhaea and dy&s;entery; they like|wi&s;e u&s;e it externally, to remove films from the eyes of &s;heep; the Molucca beans are worn as amulets again&s;t witchcraft. Ambergris is al&s;o found on the &s;hore among the&s;e i&s;lands. A wea|ver of Berrera found a lump of this &s;ub&s;tance, which he burned by night as a lamp, until the &s;trong &s;cent produced a &s;evere head-ach, and di&s;|covered its true nature.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid of the inhabitants of Lewis, their language, religion, and cu&s;toms, may be ap|plied to tho&s;e of Harries, with this difference, that they di&s;til no &s;pirit of their own, in lieu of which they purcha&s;e brandy: they u&s;e the &s;eeds of the wild carrot for hops in brewing, they &s;wal|low a decoction of the <HI>allium latifolium,</HI> or wild garlick, as a powerful lithontriptic in the &s;tone and gravel: they cure deafne&s;s by blowing pow|der of tobacco into the ear through a quill, and adopt &s;ome other medical experiments, which are peculiar to their own i&s;land.</P>
<P>Some of the inferior i&s;les of the Lewis and Har|ries, we have already mentioned. Bernera lies about two leagues to the &s;outhward of Harries, and is five miles in circumference. The &s;oil is &s;andy, and when manured with the alga marina,
<PB N="475" REF="4940">
extremely fertile, producing in &s;ome places an in|crea&s;e thirty fold of barley; nay, one grain has been known to produce fourteen ears, when the &s;ea&s;on was remarkably favourable. The face of the i&s;land is extremely agreeable in &s;ummer, ex|hibiting a plea&s;ing variety of corn fields and clover pa&s;ture. Here is a fre&s;h-water lake called Loch|bruis, diver&s;ified with &s;mall i&s;lands, and abound|ing with eels, which the natives, by the help of lights, catch in the night-time, as they fall down a rivulet towards the &s;ea, in heaps twi&s;ted toge|ther. There are two chapels in this i&s;land dedi|cated to St. A&s;aph and St. Columbus; and near the former is a &s;tone &s;tanding erect about eight feet above ground.</P>
<P>At the ea&s;t end of this i&s;le there is a &s;trange reciprocation of the flux and reflux of the &s;ea, and another no le&s;s remarkable upon the we&s;t &s;ide of the long i&s;land; the tides from the &s;outh|we&s;t run along northward, &s;o that during the or|dinary cour&s;e of the tides, the flood runs ea&s;t in the Frith, where Bernera lies, and the ebb runs we&s;t: thus the &s;ea ebbs and flows regularly for four days before, and as long after the full and change of the moon, the &s;pring tides generally ri&s;ing fourteen feet perpendicular, and the others proportionably; but for four days before, and as many after the quarter-moons, there is a &s;ingular variation: at that time, a &s;outherly moon making high-water, the cour&s;e of the tide being ea&s;tward, it begins to flow at half an hour after nine in the morning, and continues to flow till half an hour after three in the afternoon, when it is high|water; but when it begins to ebb, the current runs &s;till ea&s;tward, until it be low-water; &s;o that the tide runs ea&s;tward twelve hours together, that is from half pa&s;t nine in the morning, till half pa&s;t nine at night; yet when the night tide be|gins
<PB N="476" REF="4950">
to flow, the current turns, and runs we&s;t|ward all night for twelve hours, during both flood and ebb: thus, the reciprocations continue, one flood and ebb running twelve hours ea&s;tward, and another running twelve hours we&s;tward, till within four days of the full and new moon; then they re&s;ume their ordinary cour&s;e, running ea&s;t during the &s;ix hours of flood, and we&s;t during the &s;ix hours of ebb. There is yet another phenomenon in the&s;e tides, not le&s;s remarkable than that we have de&s;cribed. Between the vernal and autumnal equinox, that is during one half of the year, the tides, about the quarter moons, run all day ea&s;t|ward, and all night we&s;tward; and during the other &s;ix months, their cour&s;e is quite the rever&s;e, we&s;tward in the day, and ea&s;tward in the night.</P>
<P>In the &s;mall i&s;land of Pabbay, there are two chapels, one dedicated to the virgin Mary, and the other to St. Muluag; and here re&s;ides the &s;teward of St. Kilda. About half a league to the &s;outh|ward lies the i&s;le of Sellay, not more than a mile in circumference, yet yielding extraordinary pa&s;|turage. The i&s;le Taran&s;ay, a league farther to the northward, three miles round, is fruitful in corn and gra&s;s, produces a con&s;iderable quantity of yellow talc, and boa&s;ts of two chapels dedicated to St. Tarran and St. Keith. The i&s;lands of Ga&s;ker, Scarp, En&s;ay, Quedam, Hermetra, and a clu&s;ter of other &s;mall i&s;les on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Harries, are too incon&s;iderable to de&s;erve a parti|cular de&s;cription; mo&s;t of them, however, are in|habited, and the re&s;t &s;erve for pa&s;ture to &s;heep and black cattle. North Vi&s;t is &s;eparated from Har|ries, by a channel about three leagues in breadth, the navigation through which, is rendered difficult by rocks above and below water. It lies to the &s;outhward of Harries, in form of a &s;emi-circle, ex|tending about nine miles in length from north to
<PB N="477" REF="4960">
&s;outh, and thirty in circumference. To the ea&s;t|ward the country is mountainous and barren; but on the we&s;t &s;ide the ground is plain and arable, and the &s;oil exceedingly fertile, producing plenti|ful harve&s;ts of barley, oats, and rye; even the hilly parts afford good pa&s;turage for &s;heep and black cattle. They till the land fir&s;t with a &s;mall &s;harp plough called wre&s;tle, for drawing the line, and cutting the roots of the heath or bent; then fol|lows, in the &s;ame tracks, the larger plough drawn by four hor&s;es. In this long range of i&s;lands, we likewi&s;e reckon South Vi&s;t, Borrera, Hei&s;kir, Ille|ray, Valay, Benbecula, Lingay, Eri&s;ca, Barray, and many others of le&s;&s;er note, forming a &s;ur|pri&s;ing number of inlets, creeks, and harbours teeming with the riches of the ocean. On the we&s;tern coa&s;t of North Vi&s;t ri&s;es the rock Eou&s;mil, famous for being the &s;cene of an annual &s;eal fi&s;h|ing in the end of October. The fi&s;hermen row thither in their boat, again&s;t the wind, le&s;t they &s;hould be driven out into the ocean, or give notice of their approach to the &s;eals, which have the &s;en&s;e of &s;melling very acute. The crew, being landed on the rock, &s;ecure the pa&s;&s;es, and then attack the &s;eals with long &s;taves, as they lie ba&s;king in the &s;un. The&s;e animals, being thus a&s;&s;ailed, make the be&s;t of their way to the &s;ea, and very often force the pa&s;&s;es over the bellies of their antago|ni&s;ts, who endeavour to knock them down with their weapons, by &s;miting them on the forehead: &s;ometimes the &s;eal e&s;capes with a tumour on his forehead, which makes a very ferocious addition to his a&s;pect: &s;ometimes he &s;eizes his adver&s;ary's &s;taff in his teeth, and carries it to &s;ea as a trophy: many lo&s;e their lives, by endeavouring to &s;ave their young, which they tumble before them in their re|treat. The i&s;landers ob&s;erve &s;ome &s;trange peculi|arities in the&s;e amphibious animals. A &s;eal will
<PB N="478" REF="4970">
not eat any fi&s;h, until he has flea'd it with his nails and teeth. The males and females couple as regularly as if they were married: if any indi|vidual pre&s;umes to encroach upon a female al|ready di&s;po&s;ed of, her mate, at his return, di&s;co|vers the in&s;ult by a wonderful &s;agacity, and takes vengeance on the adulterer in a bloody conflict, which often gives a red tincture to the &s;ea. The &s;eal and his mate are often &s;een in the attitude of ki&s;&s;ing like lovers of the human &s;pecies: the mothers are very tender of their young, until they are capable to provide for them&s;elves, and then they drive them away with many hard blows. The natives of the&s;e i&s;lands pickle the fle&s;h of &s;eals with the a&s;hes of &s;ea-ware in&s;tead of &s;alt, and eat it occa&s;ionally with a good appetite. This meat is found to be a&s;tringent; but the liver being dried, pulverized, and given in milk, aqua vitae, or red wine, is counted an infallible cure in the dy&s;entery. Even per&s;ons of fa&s;hion will eat &s;eal's fle&s;h when cured in the manner of ham, and the vulgar Roman catholics on the&s;e i&s;lands are per|mitted to feed upon them in Lent as natives of the &s;ea. Their &s;kins are made into ropes, caps, pouches, and girdles, worn as preventatives of the &s;ciatica. Valay lies to the we&s;tward of North Vi&s;t, about four miles in circumference, flat and fruit|ful in corn and pa&s;ture, with three chapels and two &s;tone cro&s;&s;es about &s;even feet high. A league to the north-ea&s;t is the i&s;land of Borera, nearly of the &s;ame magnitude and fertility, with a large lake of fre&s;h water in the middle, and a burial place for the monks who died in the&s;e i&s;lands. In the i&s;land of Linguay by the &s;outh end of Bo|rera, the ground affords plenty of peats and turf for fuel, though in ancient times it was held &s;o &s;acred that no per&s;on would pre&s;ume to u&s;e this benefit of nature. Here likewi&s;e are produced

&s;heep, goats, hogs, hor&s;es, and black cattle; the&s;e la&s;t are killed, &s;alted in the hyde, and &s;ent to Gla&s;gow, where the merchants barrel them up in fre&s;h pickle, and export them to the We&s;t-Indies. In this i&s;land we find eagles of different kinds, hawks, phea&s;ants, grow&s;e, heath cock, pigeons, quails, plover, and a beautiful bird peculiar to the Highlands and Hebrides, called termogan, to|gether with crows, and &s;wans, and all the &s;ea|fowl common to tho&s;e latitudes. Some of the eagles &s;trike at &s;almon, and other fi&s;h that &s;wim near the &s;urface; &s;ome of them de&s;troy young deer, of which there are a few hundreds in this i&s;land. The eagle fixing his talons between the deer's horns, beats him about the eyes with his wings, and terrifies the poor animal in &s;uch a manner, that he fatigues him&s;elf to death in run|ning, and frequently falls over precipices. In the month of October the &s;wans come hither with a north-ea&s;terly wind, and live in the fre&s;h lakes till March, when they take their departure. The &s;ea-fowl con&s;i&s;t of the colk, which we have al|ready de&s;cribed, the gawlin, not quite &s;o large as the duck, which progno&s;ticates fair weather, by &s;inging in a melodious &s;train, from which the piper of St. Kilda compo&s;ed a pibroch; the rain goo&s;e, larger than a duck, &s;o called from its ut|tering a doleful noi&s;e before rainy weather; the bi&s;hop of Carrara, large as a goo&s;e, party-coloured, with a white &s;pot on the brea&s;t, &s;ometimes weigh|ing &s;ixteen pounds, well provided with fat, which the natives apply as a &s;overeign remedy for the &s;ciatica. This fowl &s;eldom flies, but dives with great celerity: wild gee&s;e re&s;ide here in great numbers, and prove very de&s;tructive to the barley, notwith&s;tanding all the methods which the farmers can contrive by gins, traps, and guns, to prevent the havock; the goyler, not larger than a &s;wallow,

which never lands but in the month of January; it floats on the &s;urface of the &s;ea, and dives with incredible &s;wiftne&s;s: a large number of the&s;e birds &s;een together is the infallible prelude to a &s;torm, after which they di&s;appear: for this rea&s;on the &s;eamen term them malifigres, a corruption of malae-effigies. The &s;creachan-aittin, about the &s;ize of a large mall, of a blui&s;h colour, with a bill of a carnation hue; it &s;hrieks hideou&s;ly, and when its mate is killed, makes a lamentable noi&s;e for &s;everal days, in the place where it lo&s;t its con&s;ort. The Fa&s;kedar, as large as a middling &s;ea-mew, flies with great rapidity, pur&s;ues le&s;&s;er birds, and forces them to drop their prey, which it nimbly &s;natches before it falls to the ground. Among the&s;e i&s;lands one may perceive flocks of barren fowls of different kinds, which live &s;eparate from the re&s;t of the &s;pecies on bare rocks, without any ne&s;ts or &s;helter.</P>
<P>Though the air in this place is exceedingly moi&s;t, the natives are neverthele&s;s &s;trong and healthy, and many attain to the age of one hun|dred. They delight much in riding, an exerci&s;e which is favoured by the planene&s;s of the country: at Michaelmas they have a cavalcade, fair, and races, when the natives of all ranks and &s;exes ap|pear at the rendezvous on hor&s;eback, every young man having his &s;weetheart behind him. On this fe&s;tal occa&s;ion, they give and receive pre&s;ents mu|tually; the men give knives and pur&s;es, and the women pre&s;ent curious garters and wild carrots. The i&s;land belongs to Mackdonald of Sleat: the inhabitants are chiefly Prote&s;tants, and beyond all other i&s;landers remarkable for charity and ho&s;pi|tality.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of two miles to the &s;outhward of North Vi&s;t, is the plain Benbecula, ten miles in compa&s;s, partly arable, partly covered with

heath, and exhibiting a number of fre&s;h-water lakes, well &s;tored with fi&s;h and fowl. Here are &s;ome &s;mall chapels and the ruins of a nunnery: the i&s;land belongs to Mr. Macdonald, who, with all the inhabitants, are Roman catholics.</P>
<P>At the &s;ame di&s;tance to the &s;outhward of Ben|becula, lies the i&s;land of South Vi&s;t, &s;tretching one and twenty miles in length, but no more than three or four in breadth. The ea&s;tern part is mountainous and heathy; but on the we&s;t there are large tracks of plain, arable land: the&s;e are often overflowed by inundations from fre&s;h|water lakes, which the inhabitants have not been able to re&s;train. Here are &s;een the ruins of divers forts, and a good number of kairns. The people are ho&s;pitable, &s;uper&s;titious, and famous for long life: about fifty years ago there was a man living on this i&s;land, &s;aid to be turned of one hundred and thirty, hale, &s;trong, with a clear under&s;tanding, and memory unimpaired. They are generally Roman catholics, though they live on good terms with the Prote&s;tant mini&s;ter.</P>
<P>The i&s;land Eri&s;ca, three miles in circuit, is partly arable, and yields good harve&s;ts, and be|longs to Macdonald of Moidart. Here are &s;everal churches and chapels: the people are &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak the Iri&s;h language in its original purity: one Fergus Beaton, a connoi&s;&s;eur in this dialect, was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Iri&s;h tran&s;lations of Hippocrates, Avicenna, Averroes, Johannes de Vigo, and Ber|nadus Gordonus. Many of them &s;till retain the ancient habit, and all of them are bigotted to the Roman catholic religion.</P>
<P>About two leagues and a half to the &s;outh|we&s;t of &s;outh Vi&s;t appears the i&s;le of Barray, or Barra, five miles in length and three in breadth, partly mountainous, and partly capable of cultiva|tion, having the advantage of a commodious har|bour
<PB N="482" REF="5010">
on the ea&s;t &s;ide, and a good fi&s;hery of cod, ling, and &s;almon; which la&s;t are &s;peckled, &s;urpri&s;ingly nimble and &s;hy, in&s;omuch that the fi&s;hermen are obliged to u&s;e three nets within one another, that if the fi&s;h &s;prings over two, it may be caught in the third. In the &s;outh end of Barray, there is an orchard planted with fruit-trees, though few of them produce fruit: but all &s;orts of pot-herbs and roots grow here in great perfection; nay, the natives even rai&s;ed tobacco: but it never an&s;wered their purpo&s;e or expectation. This i&s;land, to|gether with the adjacent &s;maller i&s;les, belongs to the laird of Macneil, &s;aid to be the thirty-&s;ixth in lineal de&s;cent from him of the &s;ame name, who fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this e&s;tate. He holds it however, in va&s;&s;alage, from Mackdonald of Slate, to whom he pays a yearly quit-rent. In the little i&s;le of Ker|mul, about a quarter of a mile to the &s;outhward of Barray, is the family-&s;eat, furni&s;hed with a watch-tower, and &s;urrounded by a kind of fortifi|cation. The cockman, or watchman, is con&s;tantly on the tower to reconnoitre and prevent &s;urprize; and the government of the ca&s;tle is ve&s;ted in a con&s;table, who is very cautious of admitting any &s;tranger in the ab&s;ence of Mackneil or his lady. The church on this i&s;land is dedicated to St. Barr, a wooden image of whom &s;tands on the altar, and of this patron they recite a legend of miracles: hard by is a little chapel in which Mackneil and his de&s;cendants are interred. The inhabitants are very courteous and ho&s;pitable: as &s;oon as any &s;tranger lands on the i&s;land, they oblige him to eat, on the &s;uppo&s;ition that the keen air of the ocean mu&s;t have &s;harpened his appetite. When three or four gue&s;ts arrive, each, by ancient cu&s;tom, is lodged in a &s;eparate hou&s;e; and thus man and wife are very often parted. The natives chiefly em|ploy them&s;elves in fi&s;hing and climbing rocks for
<PB N="483" REF="5020">
eggs and &s;ea fowl. The chief climber is di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by the name of <HI>gingich</HI> or hero, and pays dear for his pre-eminence. When the boat ap|proaches the rock the gingich fir&s;t leaps upon it, and, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of an hor&s;e-hair rope, draws his companions after him from one preci|pice to another. At their return to the boats with their booty of eggs and fowls, the gingich, at the hazard of his life, jumps into the ve&s;&s;el, which is generally to&s;&s;ed by a violent agitation of the &s;ea, and keeps her &s;teady to the rock, until the re&s;t enter: in compen&s;ation for his courage and dex|terity, he is gratified with a larger proportion of their plunder.</P>
<P>When a tenant's wife dies, the hu&s;band makes application to Mackneil, de&s;iring him to recom|mend another helpmate, and his reque&s;t is imme|diately granted: then he vi&s;its her, carrying along with him a bottle of &s;trong waters for the ce|lebration of the marriage, which is con&s;ummated without further ceremony. When the husband dies, the widow pre&s;ents the &s;ame petition, and is accommodated in the &s;ame manner. Should a te|nant lo&s;e his milch cows by the &s;everity of the &s;ea&s;on, or any other misfortune, Mackneil is obliged to &s;upply him with the like number; and when an old man is pa&s;t his labour, the laird maintains him in his own family, for the remain|ing part of his life. There are &s;everal &s;mall i&s;les to the &s;outhward of Barray, known by the name of the Bi&s;hop's i&s;les, becau&s;e they were held of the bi&s;hop: there are al&s;o divers &s;mall i&s;lands on the ea&s;t and north, which afford pa&s;turage, and the convenience of fi&s;hing. Mackneil of Barray, and all his dependants, are Roman catholics, and celebrate the fea&s;t of St. Barr with great &s;olemnity, on the twenty-&s;eventh day of September.</P>

Among the larger i&s;lands of the Hebrides we rank the i&s;le of Skie, &s;o called from Skianach, which, in the Er&s;e dialect, &s;ignifies winged, be|cau&s;e the two promontories of Valerne&s;s and Tro|terne&s;s, by which it is bounded on the north-we&s;t and north-ea&s;t, are &s;uppo&s;ed to re&s;emble wings. The i&s;land lies between the &s;hire of Ro&s;s and the we&s;tern part of Lewis, extending forty miles in length from north to &s;outh, in &s;ome places twenty, and in others, thirty in breadth, the cir|cumference of the whole amounting to about one hundred. This too is compo&s;ed of many differ|ent i&s;lands and rocks, the mo&s;t remarkable of which we &s;hall de&s;cribe in their turns. The i&s;land of Skie is divided between two proprietors: the &s;outhern part belongs to the laird of Macleod, &s;aid to be lineally de&s;cended from Leod, &s;on to the black prince of Man: the northern di&s;trict, or barony of Trotterne&s;s, is the property of Sir James Macdonald, who&s;e ance&s;tor was Donald, king or lord of the i&s;les, and chief of the nu|merous clan of Macdonalds, who are counted the mo&s;t warlike of all the Highlanders. Skie is part of the &s;hire of Inverne&s;s, and formerly be|longed to the dioce&s;e of the i&s;les: on the &s;outh, it is parted from the main land by a channel three leagues in breadth, though at the ferry of Glenelly it is &s;o narrow that a man may be heard calling for the boat, from one &s;ide to the other. Skie is well provided with a variety of excellent bays and harbours; for example, on the &s;outh, by the penin&s;ula Oron&s;a, otherwi&s;e called Diurman; to the ea&s;tward, between Skie and the i&s;land Scalpa; to the north, Lochs-legichan, and Loch-portry, which la&s;t is a capacious harbour; the i&s;land Tulm at the mo&s;t nothern extremity; on the we&s;t Loch-uge, Loch-&s;ni&s;ort or Loch-arni&s;ort, Loch-fallart, Loch-brackadil, Loch-einard, Loch|&s;lapan,
<PB N="485" REF="5040">
Loch-affort, and an anchoring place for barks, between Skie and the i&s;le of Soa. Some of the&s;e, however, are to be attempted with great caution, on account of rocks under water, and dangerous currents.</P>

<P>The face of the country is roughened with mountains, &s;ome of which are &s;o high, as to be covered with &s;now on the top, at Mid&s;ummer: in general their &s;ides are cloathed with heath and gra&s;s, which afford good pa&s;turage for &s;heep and black cattle. Between the mountains there are &s;ome fertile vallies, and the greater part of the land toward the &s;ea-coa&s;t, is plain and arable. Where there is &s;uch a number of hills, the coun|try mu&s;t abound with &s;prings and fountains, the water of which is remarkably pure, and in many wells counted medicinal. The i&s;land is well wa|tered with a great number of rivers, above thirty of which afford &s;almon; and &s;ome of them pro|duce black mu&s;&s;els, in which pearls are bred; particularly the rivers Kilmartin and Ord: Martin was a&s;&s;ured by the proprietor of the former, that a pearl had been found in it, valued at twenty pounds &s;terling. Here is a con&s;iderable number of fre&s;h-water lakes well &s;tored with trout and eels. The large&s;t of the&s;e lakes takes its denomi|nation from St. Columbus, to whom is dedicated a chapel that &s;tands upon a &s;mall i&s;le in the mid|dle of the lake. Skie likewi&s;e affords &s;everal ca|taracts that roar down the rocks with great im|petuo&s;ity. That the i&s;land has been formerly co|vered with woods, appears from the large trunks of fir, and other trees, daily dug out of the bogs and peat mar&s;hes in every part of this country. There are &s;till &s;everal coppices of woods &s;cattered

<P>The air is cold and moi&s;t; the climate rainy, but not unwhol&s;ome: indeed, the people pretend to qualify it by drinking large do&s;es of u&s;que|baugh. The ea&s;t wind is attended with fair wea|ther; the &s;outh-we&s;t with rain; the wind from the north is cold and pinching: in &s;ummer, the wind always blows &s;tronger by land than by &s;ea; but in winter the contrary phoenomenon is ob|&s;ervable. The wind, in &s;ummer, &s;ometimes blows from different quarters, at the &s;ame time, in&s;omuch that two boats will &s;ail in contrary directions within a league of each other. The tide of ebb runs &s;outherly, and the flood northerly, except where interrupted by headlands or promontories; in which ca&s;e, the tides hold a contrary cour&s;e. The ebb is always lowe&s;t with a north wind, and the flood highe&s;t when it blows from the &s;outh: the two chief &s;pring tides happen at or near the ver|nal and autumnal equinox.</P>
<P>The mould of this i&s;land is generally black, though it likewi&s;e affords clay of different co|lours; &s;uch as white, red, and blue, and in &s;ome places fuller's earth. At the villages of Borue and Glenmore, the natives dig very fine earth of various colours, of the con&s;i&s;tence of tallow; and, in different parts, they find abundance of fine white marl, which being &s;pread upon a piece of ground covered with heath, de&s;troyed this &s;hrub in a &s;hort time root and branch, and enriched the &s;oil to &s;uch a degree, that when &s;own with barley, it yielded an increa&s;e five and thirty fold. The i&s;le of Skie produces barley, oats, rye, pea&s;e, and
<PB N="487" REF="5060">
plenty of gra&s;s for pa&s;ture, together with pot-herbs and roots for the kitchen: in the article of fruit it is very defective; though there are &s;ome in the or|chards belonging to the proprietors. Among the plants which it brings forth in common with the other i&s;les, we reckon wild &s;age, wild thyme, the myrtillis, the erica baccifera, violets, tan&s;y, the myrrhis &s;ilve&s;tris, urtica, chickweed, foxglove, camomile, &s;curvy-gra&s;s, &s;orrel, flamula-jovis or &s;pirewort, crowfoot, wild garlick, cariophyleta alpina chamectreos foliis, found in no other part of Britain, carmel, or the argatilis &s;ylvaticus, di&s;|tingui&s;hed by a blue flower in Italy, plantane, hart's-tongue, maiden-hair, yarrow, St. John's|wort, golden-rod, and the herb &s;hunnis, peculiar to the&s;e i&s;lands and &s;ome parts of the oppo&s;ite main land. It is highly valued by the natives, who eat it raw and &s;odden, with fle&s;h, fi&s;h, and milk. Of the &s;ea plants, the chief are linarich, &s;lake, alga|marina, and dul&s;e: the medicinal u&s;es of all the&s;e plants are well known to the inhabitants.</P>
<P>The minerals found in the i&s;le of Skie are lead and iron ore, which, however, have never been wrought to any advantage. Near the village Sartle, the natives find black and white marca&s;ites, and variegated pebbles. The apple&s;glen, in the neighbourhood of Loch-fallart, produces beauti|ful agates of different &s;izes and colours: &s;tones of a purple hue are, after great rains, found in the rivulets: chry&s;tal, of different colours and forms, abounds in &s;everal parts of the i&s;land, as well as black and white marble, free-&s;tone, lime|&s;tone, cornua ammonis, velumnites, the lapis hecticus and talc: &s;mall red and white coral is found on the &s;outhern and we&s;tern coa&s;ts in great abundance; and there are divers caves in the i&s;land, from the roofs of which a petrifying fluid di&s;tils. The fuel of this i&s;land con&s;i&s;ts chiefly of
<PB N="488" REF="5070">
peat and turf, which are impregnated with iron ore and &s;alt-petre; and coal has been di&s;covered in &s;everal di&s;tricts.</P>
<P>The animals of Skie, are &s;uch as we have de|&s;cribed in the other larger i&s;lands, hor&s;es, hogs, &s;heep, goats, cows, and deer: the black cattle are here, as in other parts of this country, expo&s;ed to all the rigors of a &s;evere winter, without any other provender than the tops of the heath and the alga marina; &s;o that they appear like mere &s;keletons in the &s;pring, though as the gra&s;s grows up, they &s;oon become plump and juicy, the beef being &s;weet, tender, and finely interlarded. The&s;e animals di&s;tingui&s;h the time of ebb, by a &s;ure in|&s;tinct, even when they are not in &s;ight of the &s;hore, whither they ha&s;ten in a &s;tring one after another. Here are land and water fowl in abun|dance, eagles, hawks, heathcocks, grow&s;e, tar|magan, pidgeons, plover, wild gee&s;e, cranes, coulternebs, guillamots, malls, &s;ea cormorants, and carraras. The amphibious animals are &s;eals and otters. Among the reptiles they reckon vipers, a&s;ps, wea&s;els, frogs, toads, and three different kinds of &s;erpents; the fir&s;t &s;potted black and white, and very poi&s;onous; the &s;econd, yellow with brown &s;pots; and the third of a brown co|lour, the &s;malle&s;t and lea&s;t poi&s;onous. All the coa&s;t of Skie &s;warms with fi&s;h, cod, ling, mac|karel, whiting, haddock, thornback, turbot, grey lord, or blackmouth, as large as a &s;almon, and herrings, which they pre&s;erve without &s;alt, by gutting and hanging them to dry in the &s;moke. In the bays and anchoring places, the natives find &s;hell-fi&s;h of all kinds. The kyle of Scalpa teems with oy&s;ters in &s;uch a manner, that, after &s;ome &s;pring tides, twenty hor&s;e-loads of them are left upon the &s;ands. Near the village of Bern&s;till, the beach yields mu&s;&s;els &s;ufficient to maintain

&s;ixty per&s;ons per day; this providential &s;upply helps to &s;upport many poor families in times of &s;carcity. Shell-fi&s;h are plumper at the increa&s;e than at the decrea&s;e of the moon, as al&s;o while the wind blows from the &s;outh-we&s;t. Cockles and &s;pout-fi&s;h &s;ink deeper in the &s;and during a north wind. The limpits cling &s;o fa&s;t to the rocks, that it is nece&s;&s;ary to knock them off with a hammer, unle&s;s they are &s;urpri&s;ed in moving, and then the lea&s;t touch will pull them away. When eaten in June, they are &s;aid to be productive of the jaundice, but at all other times delicate food of ea&s;y dige&s;tion. The fi&s;h and &s;hell of the wilk and periwinkle are brui&s;ed and boiled together, and the broth being &s;trained and drank for &s;everal days &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, is accounted a good remedy for the &s;tone.</P>

regale them&s;elves with fle&s;h-meat: their or|dinary food con&s;i&s;ts of butter, chee&s;e, milk, po|tatoes, colewort, brochan, and a di&s;h called oon, which indeed is no other than the froth of boiled milk or whey rai&s;ed with a &s;tick like that u&s;ed in making chocolate. This kind of &s;yllabub they eat with &s;poons, and find it as nouri&s;hing as much more &s;ub&s;tantial food. Their bread is very often made of corn cut down for the purpo&s;e: they &s;et the &s;traw on fire, and the grain is left &s;corched on the ground: this is immediately ground and baked; and the bread thus produced, is called graddan, more palatable than that made in the other way, but not &s;o a&s;tringent and nouri&s;hing. Perhaps they are more than their neighbours di&s;|po&s;ed to ob&s;erve the moon's influence. They dig their peats, build up their earthen dykes, fell their wood, and even cut ru&s;hes always in the moon's decrea&s;e, having ob&s;erved that if the&s;e operations are performed in the increa&s;e, the peats will always continue moi&s;t and burn &s;moaking, the dykes will moulder, the timber rot, and the ru&s;hes tear.</P>
<P>Of all the i&s;landers, the natives of Skie are counted the be&s;t phy&s;icians, though they u&s;e no other remedies than tho&s;e that are naturally found in their own country. For inflammatory di&s;orders they let blood, admini&s;ter a kind of pti&s;an of violets boiled in water, and promote a diaphore&s;is, by directing the patient to put on a wet &s;hirt, which has been boiled, while it is yet &s;moking hot: but the ancient method of &s;weating practi&s;ed by the&s;e i&s;landers &s;eems to have been more effectual. They fir&s;t heated the earthen floor like an oven; then &s;wept away the fire, covered the place with &s;traw, upon which they poured water, and the patient lying down amid&s;t the &s;team, underwent a pro|fu&s;e &s;weat. To procure pa&s;&s;age by &s;tool or urine,
<PB N="491" REF="5100">
they give a decoction of the plant dul&s;e, with &s;ome fre&s;h butter: as a narcotic, they u&s;e a de|coction of chick-weed warm, by way of fomenta|tion, the feet, knees, and ancles; and likewi&s;e apply the plant in &s;ub&s;tance warm to the neck, and between the &s;houlders. As a frontal, for the &s;ame purpo&s;e, they mix the tops of nettles with the whites of eggs, and lay it in a poultice to the temples. The plant linarich brui&s;ed is likewi&s;e applied to the head and temples, as a cure for the megrim; as is likewi&s;e the erica baccifera boiled in water. For the &s;carlet fever, they pre&s;cribe brandy. The jaundice is cured by &s;earing the ver|tebra in the manner before de&s;cribed. The &s;ciatica is expelled by rubbing the part affected with the fat of the Carrara fowl; but the mo&s;t effectual me|thod of overcoming this di&s;temper, is by rai&s;ing a bli&s;ter on the part with the flamula jovis, or wild crowfoot. Some drink an infu&s;ion of the flamula jovis, as a purge; and in order, to &s;ave their throats from excoriation, &s;wallow it in a vehicle of melted butter. Water-gruel without &s;alt, the infu&s;ion of mountain garlic, and of dul&s;e, and the broth of wilks and limpets, are counted &s;pecifics in the &s;tone. Scurvy-gra&s;s boiled, and eaten with butter, is &s;uppo&s;ed to be a &s;overeign cure for the cholic, co&s;tivene&s;s, and &s;titches. An in|fu&s;ion of tan&s;y in whey or whi&s;ky, is thought to kill worms. The root of the plant carmel is an aromatic cordial, and carminative, with which the natives give a flavour to their aqua vitae. Wild &s;age is u&s;ed both in &s;ub&s;tance and decoc|tion, as a remedy again&s;t worms in hor&s;es; and is &s;aid to cure blindne&s;s in &s;heep and cattle, by being chewed and &s;tuffed into their ears. As remedies again&s;t fluxes, they give the &s;yrup of bilberries, a decoction of plantane and water, in which the hectic &s;tone, heated red hot, has been
<PB N="492" REF="5110">
quenched. For the tooth-ach they apply the flamula jovis to the temples in a limpet &s;hell; or a green turf heated among embers to the &s;ide of the head affected. In coughs and hoar&s;ene&s;s they bathe the feet in warm water, for the &s;pace of fifteen minutes; then rub a quantity of deer's grea&s;e into the &s;oals of the feet. For con&s;umptions they admini&s;ter ale, in the wort of which hart's tongue and maiden's hair have been infu&s;ed: they pre&s;cribe for ordinary drink milk or water, in which the hectic &s;tone has been quenched; the patients wa&s;h their hands and feet in the &s;ame infu&s;ion, and drink plentifully brochan and milk, in which the plant yarrow and the hectic &s;tone have been boiled. They pretend to cure the iliaca pa&s;&s;io, by giving a draught of cold water with a little oatmeal in it, and hanging the patient by the heels: a large handful of dul&s;e is exter|nally applied to the belly, again&s;t the &s;ame di&s;|order, as well as to expel the after-birth. For purges they take &s;trong infu&s;ions of &s;curvy-gra&s;s and dul&s;e, with a little fre&s;h butter; and for ape|rient ch&s;ters they inject the decoction of the plant mercury, or iris, with &s;alt butter. They make vulnerary ointments of St. John's wort, or golden rod, mixed with &s;heep's grea&s;e or fre&s;h butter; but the mo&s;t effectual is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the fat of fowls made into a pudding in the bird's own &s;tomach. The remedies they u&s;e for the bites of vipers and &s;erpents are the&s;e: they pluck the rump of a live hou&s;e-cock, and apply it to the wound, from whence it is believed to &s;uck the poi&s;on: the cock immediately &s;wells and dies, and no bea&s;t or bird of prey will touch his carca&s;e: they wa&s;h the wound with water, in which they have &s;teeped the forky &s;ting, which is no other than the tongue of the adder: they apply to the part affected the head of the &s;erpent that gave the wound: new chee&s;e
<PB N="493" REF="5120">
laid in time to the wound, is &s;uppo&s;ed to extract the poi&s;on: we may venture to &s;ay, that in many ca&s;es none of the&s;e remedies will prove effectual. When bones are broken they apply to the fractured part a pa&s;te made of barley-meal and the whites of eggs, and &s;u&s;tain the limb with &s;plinters. In|flammations of the eyes they cure by applying to them the plant fern, mixed up with the white of of an egg, and &s;pread on a pledget of tow: they ripen boils and tumours with a warm poultice of the female jacobea, malaxed with fre&s;h butter. Martin tells us of two brothers, natives of this i&s;land, who after they had been about nine or ten hours at &s;ea as fi&s;hermen, always found their bellies begin to &s;well; but never could force a pa&s;&s;age, either by &s;tool or urine, until they came a&s;hore, and then they evacuated both ways with|out any difficulty. At length one of their com|panions carried a green turf into the boat, which at fir&s;t was the &s;ource of a quarrel, but afterwards produced a very agreeable effect. When their bellies began to &s;well as u&s;ual, and they were racked with excruciating pains, the author of the expedient with difficulty prevailed on them to &s;tand on the turf; in which attitude they &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively obtained a free evacuation: and this con|trivance never failed in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>There are two fairs held annually at Portry, on the ea&s;t &s;ide of Skie; the fir&s;t on the middle of June, the other about the beginning of Septem|ber. The commodities here &s;old, are hor&s;es, cows, &s;heep, goats, hides, butter, chee&s;e, fi&s;h, and wool. The cattle &s;old in the&s;e fairs &s;wim over to the main land through a mile, or half a mile of &s;ea. Many thou&s;ands of the&s;e bea&s;ts are driven yearly up to England, where they are fatted for the market, and counted delicious eating.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="5130">
In Skie, as in the other i&s;lands, appear many ruins of Dani&s;h forts, watch-towers, beacons, temples, and &s;epulchral monuments; nor is there wanting a great number of caves or caverns, &s;ome of which are capacious, and almo&s;t impregnable. All the forts are known by the term <HI>Dun,</HI> &s;uch as Dun-Skudborg, Dun-Derig, Dun-Skerine&s;s, Dun-David, &amp;c.</P>
<P>Skie is &s;urrounded by inferior i&s;les. Soa-Bret|til, to the &s;outhward, is five miles in circum|ference, exhibiting a mixture of heath, wood, mora&s;s, and pa&s;ture ground, producing red garden corinths, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been carried thither by birds; but very little improved by agriculture. The i&s;land Oron&s;a, a penin&s;ula at low water, may be about a mile in circuit, and is remarkably fer|tile. The i&s;le of Pabbay, more to the northward, two miles in compa&s;s, produces excellent pa&s;ture, and the &s;hore affords plenty of crabs and lob&s;ters. Scalpa, in the &s;ame direction, is twice as large, generally mountainous, woody, and well watered with &s;prings and rivulets. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, a &s;tream running down the face of a rock petrifies into a white &s;ub&s;tance, of which the na|tives make excellent lime. Near the &s;ame place is a quarry of free-&s;tone. On the we&s;t &s;ide there are divers caves, which &s;erve for lodging to &s;ome families that go thither in the &s;ummer for the convenience of grazing, hunting, and fi&s;hing. All the inhabitants are fi&s;hermen; and a law pre|vails among them, that all their fi&s;hing lines mu&s;t be of an equal length. Here likewi&s;e are &s;ome Dani&s;h forts, one of which, called the ca&s;tle Vreokle, is three &s;tories high. The property of the i&s;land is ve&s;ted in Mr. Mackleod, a cadet from the laird of Mackleod: he lives in the village of Clachan, which is adorned with a &s;mall tower, and provided with an orchard that produces &s;ome
<PB N="495" REF="5140">
fruit and berries; he is re&s;pected with the utmo&s;t veneration by his tenants, who are all Prote&s;tants, remarkable for their ho&s;pitality. The &s;mall i&s;lands of Rona, Fladda, Altvig, Troda, Fladda-chican, with its &s;urrounding rocks, in which the monk Ogorgon lies buried; Tulm, A&s;crib, Timan, I&s;a, Mingoy, Bria, and Harlas, are too incon&s;iderable to de&s;erve a particular de&s;cription: it may &s;uffice to &s;ay, that, in general, they are fit for pa&s;ture, afford plenty of fi&s;h, and a great number of &s;ea|fowl.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of four leagues to the &s;outh|ward of Skie, is the &s;mall i&s;land of Cannay, which with Rum, Egg, Muck, and Aich, lie in a clu&s;ter oppo&s;ite to the coa&s;t of Lochaber. Cannay, about two miles in length, is &s;urrounded with rocks, pro|duces corn and pa&s;ture, affords a fi&s;hery of cod and ling, and good anchorage on the north-ea&s;t part of the i&s;land. The natives are Roman catholics, and have a church dedicated to St. Columbus: the i&s;le belongs to a gentleman of the name of Macdonald.</P>
<P>Rum extends five miles from north to &s;outh, is for the mo&s;t part mountainous and heathy; yet arable towards the &s;ea-coa&s;t, watered with rivers well &s;tored with trout and &s;almon. The hills afford pa&s;turage to &s;heep, cattle, and &s;ome hun|dreds of deer. The inhabitants are prote&s;tants, who u&s;e a &s;mall chapel for wor&s;hip, and the i&s;land belongs to Macklean, of Coll.</P>
<P>Egg, being three miles in length, is mountain|ous from the middle towards the we&s;t; but on the other &s;ide more plain and arable. On the &s;outh &s;ide there is a commodious harbour; on the &s;outh-we&s;t a large cave or cavern large enough to contain three hundred men; on the north-we&s;t we find a quarry of &s;oft, white &s;tone; to the &s;outhward is the high rock Skeer-egg, with a fre&s;h
<PB N="496" REF="5150">
water lake in the middle: this is a natural fort, becau&s;e there is no acce&s;s to it, but by one narrow pa&s;&s;age. Here are divers wells accounted medi|cinal, particularly one in the village of Froepen|nies, and that called St. Katharine's, on the &s;outh coa&s;t of the i&s;land: this fountain having been con&s;ecrated by a popi&s;h prie&s;t, is held in great ve|neration by the i&s;landers, who generally profe&s;s that religion, and are remarkably &s;uper&s;titious. They exerci&s;e their devotion in a church on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;le, dedicated to St. Donnan, who is their tutelar &s;aint. The proprietors of the i&s;land are Mackdonald, of Moydort, and Mack|donald, of Moron.</P>
<P>Muck may be four miles in circumference, mountainous and rocky, yet producing &s;ome corn and good pa&s;ture, which la&s;t &s;erves to feed abund|ance of &s;heep and black cattle. The rocks afford excellent hawks, and the &s;ea plenty of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Aich is a very &s;mall i&s;land, that merits no de|&s;cription.</P>
<P>At the di&s;tance of about four leagues to the north-ea&s;t, lie the i&s;lands of Coll and Tire-iy, di|vided by a channel half a league in breadth. Coll &s;tretches ten miles in length, and three in breadth, is rocky and mountainous; though towards the north &s;ide the ground admits of cultivation, and yields good crops of barley. It is watered with one lake, and divers rivers &s;tocked with trout and &s;almon. Cod and ling abound on this coa&s;t, of a larger &s;ize than are tho&s;e which frequent the ad|jacent i&s;les and continent. On the &s;outh-ea&s;t coa&s;t lie the ridge of rocks, called the Cairn of Coll, which have often proved fatal to mariners. To the &s;outh-ea&s;t &s;tands the ca&s;tle of Macklean of Coll, the proprietor, who profe&s;&s;es the Prote&s;tant religion, which is embraced by all the inhabitants. This i&s;le is much more healthy than that of Tire|iy
<PB N="497" REF="5160">
in the neighbourhood; and it is ob&s;ervable, that it produces a greater number of male than female children; whereas, the rever&s;e is remark|able in the other i&s;land.</P>
<P>Tire-iy, &s;o called from Tire, a country, and iy an i&s;thmus, &s;tretches four miles in length, affords no convenient harbour, is generally flat, low, fer|tile in corn, and its pa&s;ture grounds are believed to excel tho&s;e of any other i&s;le among the He|brides; yet the we&s;tern &s;ide is rocky and barren. The natives pre&s;erve their ale in large earthen ve&s;&s;els, which they prefer to wooden ca&s;ks. Small whales often run them&s;elves a&s;hore on this i&s;land, and are eaten by the inhabitants, who term it &s;ea|pork, and count it both whole&s;ome and &s;alutary. Here are &s;everal Dani&s;h forts and circles of &s;tones, like tho&s;e we have already de&s;cribed. The inha|bitants profe&s;s the prote&s;tant communion, and the pari&s;h church is called Soroby. The people are &s;ubject to the ague, and in the &s;outhern parts are mo&s;tly bald. The duke of Argyle is pro|prietor of the i&s;land, though it formerly belonged to the laird of Maclean.</P>
<P>Between the&s;e i&s;lands and the main land, lies Mull, over-again&s;t Lochaber, Swoonard, and Moy|dort, from which it is &s;eparated by a narrow chan|nel. This i&s;land, belonging to the &s;heriffdom of Argyle, extends about twenty-four miles in length, and is nearly of the &s;ame breadth. A large ridge of mountains runs through the mid|dle of the i&s;le, remarkably high in &s;ome places. The coa&s;t is rocky on the we&s;t; but there are anchoring places and bays in different corners of the i&s;land. The bay of Duart, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, is counted a good harbour, and much fre|quented by &s;trangers: Lochbuy, on the oppo|&s;ite &s;hore, affords but indifferent riding: there is likewi&s;e the Bloody Bay, oppo&s;ite to the north
<PB N="498" REF="5170">
end of I-colm-kill, fit only for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, to|gether with Loch-leven to the north-ea&s;t, Loch|lay, and Loch-&s;cafford. Near the north-ea&s;t end of Mull, lies the i&s;land Calve, above two miles in compa&s;s, and forming with the other a capa|cious bay, called Tonber-mory, in which the Flo|rida, one of the large&s;t &s;hips of the Spani&s;h ar|mada, was blown up by one Smollet of Dumbarton. It was &s;uppo&s;ed that &s;he had on board a large &s;um of money; a circum&s;tance which has induced &s;e|veral adventurers to dive upon the wreck, with the permi&s;&s;ion of the duke of Argyle. Pieces of gold and &s;ilver, beads, pins, toys, and &s;ome fine bra&s;s cannon have been recovered; but not enough to defray the expence of diving. Mull is remark|ably well watered with many &s;prings, brooks, rivers, and lakes, in which there is &s;tore of &s;almon and eeis. The &s;ea produces plenty of fi&s;h; the &s;hore harbours &s;eals and otters; and the moun|tains affords &s;helter to a numerous breed of foxes, that do infinite mi&s;chief among the lambs and poultry. Here are wild fowl within land, and &s;ea-birds on the &s;hore in great abundance. The ground yields excellent peat and turf for fewel: the hills and valleys are covered with gra&s;s and a variety of herbage, affording &s;u&s;tenance to nu|merous flocks of &s;heep, goats, and deer, be&s;ides great herds of black cattle, and &s;mall mettle&s;ome hor&s;es. The air being temperately cold and moi&s;t, the natives take large do&s;es of whi&s;ky by way of corrector, and chew the charmel root as an excellent re&s;torative. They have two pari&s;h churches and a little chapel, and generally pro|fe&s;s the prote&s;tant communion. There are three &s;eats or hou&s;es that belonged to gentlemen in different parts of the i&s;land. Ca&s;tle-Duart, on the ea&s;t, built upon a rock, and partly &s;urround|ed by &s;ea, belonged to Sir John Maclean, chief of
<PB N="499" REF="5180">
that ancient clan; but, he having forfeited his e&s;tate, this ca&s;tle, with the major part of the i&s;land, became the property of the duke of Argyle: on the we&s;t coa&s;t &s;tands the ca&s;tle of Moy, belonging to Maclean of Lochbuy: the third is called the ca&s;tle of Aros, &s;ituated in the middle of the i&s;land, but now in ruins. Here are likewi&s;e the remains of Dani&s;h forts and monuments. Mull is &s;ur|rounded by many &s;mall i&s;les, &s;uch as Eor&s;ce, Inch|kenneth, Vevay, Ulva, Fludday, Lungay, Bach and Call of Bach, together with the inlets Kairn-burg|more, and Kairn-burg-beg, which are natural fortre&s;&s;es, rendered almo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible by &s;teep rocks and violent currents.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t celebrated of all the we&s;tern i&s;lands is Jona, likewi&s;e called St. Columb-kill, from St. Columba, who came hither from Ireland, and here lies buried. The i&s;land &s;tretches two miles in length from &s;outh to north in the neighbourhood of Mull, and is about a mile broad from ea&s;t to we&s;t. One end of it is rocky and barren; the other, plain, arable, and fruitful. Columba having con|verted the nothern Picts by his preaching, their king is &s;aid to have be&s;towed upon him this i&s;land, where he erected two churches and two mona&s;te|ries, and in&s;tituted a &s;eminary that &s;oon became famous for learning and &s;anctity. The&s;e founda|tions were richly endowed by the kings of Scot|land and lords of the i&s;les: Jona became the ca|thedral of the bi&s;hop of the i&s;les, and, on account of its &s;uppo&s;ed &s;anctity, was cho&s;en as a burying|place for kings, heroes, and churchmen. St. Mary's church in this i&s;land is built in form of a cro&s;s, in the Gothic manner; on each &s;ide of the choir are two chapels, having, at the entrance, large pillars carved in ba&s;&s;o-relievo: the &s;teeple, doors, and windows are adorned with curious fret|work: the altar is large, magnificent, and com|po&s;ed
<PB N="500" REF="5190">
of fine poli&s;hed marble. Within the church &s;everal abbots are interred, and among the&s;e Mac|Ilikenich, who&s;e &s;tatue of black marble appears as big as the life, in an epi&s;copal habit, with the mi|tre and cro&s;ier: the re&s;t are repre&s;ented in the &s;ame manner, and &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hed by Latin in|&s;criptions. Behind the church are the ruins of a cloi&s;ter, library, and hall, in which la&s;t there u&s;ed to be public di&s;putations. At the we&s;t end of the church, in a little cell, we find the tomb of Co|lumba, but undi&s;tingui&s;hed by any in&s;cription. Hard by &s;tands the cro&s;s of St. Martin, an intire porphyry &s;tone, eight feet high above the ground, &s;tanding on a pede&s;tal, and exhibiting, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, the figure of a tree, and on the we&s;t, a large crucifix. A little di&s;tance from hence we &s;ee the ruins of Dun-ni Manich or Monks fort, built of &s;tone and lime, which &s;eems to have been a kind of rai&s;ed ba&s;tion, on which the monks enjoyed the cool air, and a pro&s;pect of the whole country. A little farther we&s;tward lie the black &s;tones, &s;o called, not for their colour, which is grey, but on account of the dreadful vengeance which was &s;aid to overtake all tho&s;e who &s;wore an oath on the&s;e &s;tones, and were afterwards guilty of perjury. Kneeling on the&s;e &s;tones with uplifted hands, Mac|donald, lord of the i&s;les, confirmed the grants of lands to his adherents and va&s;&s;als, &s;olemnly &s;wear|ing before witne&s;&s;es, that he would never revoke the rights and privileges he then be&s;towed.</P>
<P>The other church in Jona is called St. Ouran's, from the patron to which it is dedicated. The &s;tatelie&s;t tomb in this church belongs to the laird of Mac-kinnon. On the wall above appears a crucifix engraved with the family arms under|neath. On the tomb-&s;tone lies a &s;tatue as big as the life, in armour, a &s;hip under &s;ail, a lion at the head, and another at the feet, with this in&s;cription,
<PB N="501" REF="5200">
<HI>Hic e&s;t abbas Lachlan Much-fingone, et ejus filius, Abbates de I. Aetatis in Dno. Mo. CCCC. Ann.</HI> But the mo&s;t remarkable &s;pot is the coemetery on the &s;outh &s;ide, in which the king and chieftains lie buried under &s;hrines. Each particular vault was di&s;tingui&s;hed by an in&s;cription; but the&s;e are now not legible. In that on the right hand, four kings of Ireland were interred: on the left, eight kings of Norway lie buried; and in the middle|mo&s;t, eight and forty kings of Scotland. Here are likewi&s;e the tombs of Macdonald of Ila, Gil|bred, and Paul Sporran, ancient tribes of the &s;ame name; the Macleans of Duart, Lochbuy, and Coll, Macali&s;ter, likewi&s;e a branch of the Mac|donalds Mac-ouvery of Ulvay, and &s;everal digni|fied clergymen, one of which exhibits this in|&s;cription: <HI>Hic jacet Johannes Turnbull, quondam epi&s;copus Canterburien&s;is.</HI> All the&s;e monuments are of laymen, adorned with &s;tatues in armour, and armorial en&s;igns engraved in &s;tone.</P>
<P>About a quarter of a mile farther &s;outh, is the church of Ronad, the burying-place of &s;everal ab|be&s;&s;es, one of whom is thus in&s;cribed. <HI>Hic jacet Dna. Anna Terleti, filia quondam priore&s;&s;a de Jona, quae obijt anno Mo.

One copy of this apo&s;tle's life, written in the Iri&s;h character, which by the bye, is no other than the old Saxon, was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of John Macneil in the i&s;le of Barray; and another in the hands of Macdonald of Benbe|cula. The mona&s;tery of Jona furni&s;hed divers bi&s;hops to the dioce&s;es of Scotland and England; among others, the famous Aidanus, bi&s;hop of Lindisfairn, now Holy I&s;land.</P>
<P>The I&s;le of Jurah, lying oppo&s;ite to Knapdale in Argyle, belongs to the duke of that name, is four and twenty miles in length, and in &s;ome places &s;even miles broad. The face of the coun|try is generally mountainous, and remarkable for four hills, the two highe&s;t of which, being very con&s;picuous both at &s;ea and land, are called by mariners the paps of Jurah. On the coa&s;t there is &s;ome arable land, and on the hills, good pa&s;ture for hor&s;es, black cattle, &s;heep, goats, and deer. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, there is an an|choring place called Whitfarlan: towards the north end is the bay Da'l yaul; on the &s;ame coa&s;t ano|ther riding-place for ve&s;&s;els is formed by the &s;mall i&s;les of Jurah, Nin Gowir, and Coney i&s;le. The &s;hore on the we&s;t &s;ide affords coral and co|ralline. Between the north end of Jurah and the &s;mall i&s;le Scarba, we ob&s;erve the famous whirlpool called Cory-Vrekan, from Brecan, &s;on to a king of Denmark, who peri&s;hed in this gulph. His body being ca&s;t a&s;hore on the north &s;ide of Jurah, was buried in a cave, and his grave is &s;till di&s;tingui&s;hed by a tomb-&s;tone and altar. In this vortex, which extends about a mile in breadth, the &s;ea begins to boil and fer|ment with the tide of flood, increa&s;ing gradu|ally to a number of whirlpools, which, in the form of pyramids, &s;pout up the water with a great noi&s;e, as high as the ma&s;t of a &s;mall ve&s;&s;el,
<PB N="503" REF="5220">
agitated into &s;uch a foam as makes the &s;ea ap|pear white even at the di&s;tance of two leagues. About half flood the violence begins to decrea&s;e, and continues to &s;ub&s;ide, till about half an hour after high-water: then it boils till within an hour of low-water, when the &s;malle&s;t fi&s;hing boat may cro&s;s it without danger. An Engli&s;h ve&s;&s;el chanc|ing to pa&s;s this way when the vortex was in its mo&s;t violent agitation, the ma&s;ter and crew mi&s;|took it for breakers on &s;unken rocks, by which finding them&s;elves attracted in &s;pite of all their endeavours to tack about, they hoi&s;ted out their boat, and thought them&s;elves happy in reaching the &s;hore of Jurah. Mean while the &s;hip, being left to the mercy of the &s;eas and weather, was driven upon the coa&s;t of Knapdale, and entered a creek, where the people afterwards found her &s;afe, with all her &s;ails &s;tanding. Jurah is fur|ni&s;hed with many rivulets and &s;prings of ex|cellent water, and the air is remarkably healthy; its &s;alubrity being a&s;cribed to the high &s;ituation, perpetually fanned by breezes. The natives are hale, &s;trong, mo&s;tly of a black complexion, and long lived. One Gilouir Mackirain attained to the age of one hundred and four&s;core: a wo|man of the i&s;le of Scarba lived &s;even&s;core years, and here are &s;everal per&s;ons turned of one hundred. They are all Prote&s;tants, and have a church called Killcorn.</P>
<P>To the we&s;tward of Jurah lies the i&s;le of Ila, from which it is &s;eparated by a narrow channel. I&s;la extends twenty-four miles in length from north to &s;outh, and eighteen in breadth. On the ea&s;t &s;ide it is roughened with mountains and hills covered with heath: to the &s;outhward, the land is tolerably well cultivated. In &s;ome parts the inhabitants have found great plenty of lime&s;tone, and lead mines are worked in three
<PB N="504" REF="5230">
different places. The only harbour in I&s;la is at Lochdale, near the north end of the i&s;land. Here are &s;everal rivers and lakes well &s;tored with trout, eels, and &s;almon. In the center is Loch Finlagan about three miles in circuit, with the little i&s;le of that name in the middle. Here the great Macdonald, lord of the i&s;les, once re&s;ided in all the pomp of royalty; but his palace and offices are now in ruins. Here he held his &s;u|preme court of judicature, con&s;i&s;ting of fourteen judges, to which there was an appeal from all the le&s;&s;er tribunals. In&s;tead of a throne, Macdonald &s;tood on a &s;tone &s;even feet &s;quare, in which there was an impre&s;&s;ion made to receive his feet; here he was crowned and anointed by the bi&s;hop of Argyle and &s;even inferior prie&s;ts, in pre&s;ence of the chieftains, to whom he took a &s;olemn oath, importing that he would maintain their rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, and do ju&s;tice to all his va&s;&s;als. There are &s;everal &s;mall forts built on the i&s;les in fre&s;h-water lakes, and divers caverns in different parts of the i&s;land, which have been u&s;ed occa|&s;ionally as places of &s;trength. The air of I&s;la is not &s;o &s;alubrious as that of Jurah, becau&s;e it is more low and mar&s;hy: neverthele&s;s the peo|ple enjoy a good &s;hare of health: they are all Prote&s;tants and have a variety of churches and chapels. The property of the i&s;land is at pre|&s;ent ve&s;ted in Campbell of Shawfield. On the coa&s;t of Ila are &s;everal &s;mall i&s;les, &s;uch as Texa, Ouer&s;a, and Nave; nay, the natives pretend that there is an i&s;land four miles in length about thirty leagues to the &s;outh-we&s;t of Ila. They &s;ay it was di&s;covered by the ma&s;ter of an Engli&s;h &s;hip, who found it a low flat, covered with long gra&s;s, and watered by a river, on each &s;ide of which he &s;aw great heaps of fi&s;h bones. A great number of &s;eals lay ba&s;king on the rocks, and the cliffs
<PB N="505" REF="5240">
were covered with &s;ea-fowl. Finding many planks and boards which the &s;ea had ca&s;t on the &s;hore, he ordered his men to rai&s;e a pile about two &s;tories, as a land-mark for mariners. After his departure, the inhabitants of Collon&s;ay, in fair weather, di&s;cerned from the top of an emi|nence an object which they &s;uppo&s;ed to be land, which, however, vani&s;hed by next winter, when in all probability the pile was blown down by a &s;torm.</P>
<P>Two leagues to the northward of I&s;la, lies the i&s;land of Collon&s;a, comprehending Oron&s;ay, from which it is &s;eparated only in time of flood. Oron&s;ay is about four miles in circumference, a flat arable &s;urface, producing corn and pa&s;ture, adorned with a church, chapel, and mona&s;tery, built by the celebrated Columba, to whom they are dedicated: on the altar of the church there was a crucifix decorated with precious &s;tones, the mo&s;t valuable of which are in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the laird of Macduffie, in the village of Raimu&s;ed, who pre&s;erves them as reliques and &s;pecifics for all manner of di&s;ea&s;es. On the &s;outh &s;ide of the church are the tombs of this gentleman and the cadets of his family, ornamented in the Gothic manner, with trophies and figures in &s;culpture: At the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides of the church, &s;tood two &s;tone cro&s;&s;es, each twelve feet high; that on the we&s;t, of an entire &s;tone fixed on a pede&s;tal of three &s;teps, with a tree engraved on one &s;ide, and a crucifix on the other; there is an in&s;cription underneath, but &s;o effaced by time, as to be no longer legible. On the north &s;ide of the church, we ob&s;erve a &s;mall &s;quare &s;urrounded with a wall two &s;tories high, and within a le&s;&s;er &s;quare with a wall one &s;tory. Three &s;ides of it are adorned with &s;mall pillars vaulted above, and on two of the&s;e we &s;ee in&s;criptions, which the hand of time
<PB N="506" REF="5250">
has effaced. Without this &s;quare are &s;everal hou&s;es for the accommodation of the monks, with a garden at a &s;mall di&s;tance. The whole extent of Collon&s;a amounts to four miles in length and one in breadth. The inland part is mountainous, and the &s;oil of that which is ara|ble produces very &s;canty harve&s;ts; but the in|habitants breed plenty of &s;heep, hor&s;es, and black cattle. The country is watered with &s;ome fre&s;h|water lakes; and here are &s;een &s;everal Dani&s;h forts, like tho&s;e de&s;cribed in the other i&s;lands. The people are generally of a &s;warthy com|plexion, and all Prote&s;tants. The chief church is Kilouran, which communicated its name to the principal village. In the &s;ands adjoining to this place, &s;ome &s;tone coffins were found filled with human bones. The i&s;land belongs to the duke of Argyle.</P>
<P>On the we&s;t &s;ide of Kintyre, lies the i&s;le of Gigay, part of the &s;heriffdom of Argyle, &s;tretch|ing four miles in length and one in breadth, yielding good harve&s;ts of oats and barley, and excellent pa&s;turage for cattle. It affords no wood of any kind, but abundance of the mo&s;s corkir, which dyes cloth of a crim&s;on colour. Here, as in every other i&s;le, there is a well, &s;up|po&s;ed of great efficacy, exaggerated by the &s;u|per&s;tition of the people. The&s;e are all Pro|te&s;tants, and have a church called Kil-chattan, with an altar, and a great number of tomb-&s;tones, among which is the monument of the Macneils, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the greate&s;t part of the i&s;land. At the di&s;tance of a quarter of a mile &s;outh from Gigay, lies the &s;mall i&s;let Caray, about a mile in compa&s;s, affording a harbour for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, good pa&s;ture, abundance of rabbits, and belonging to Macala&s;ter of Lergy, a branch of the Macdonalds.</P>
<P><PB N="507" REF="5260">
About &s;ix leagues to the &s;outh-we&s;t of Arran, the remarkable rock of I&s;le&s;ay ri&s;es out of the &s;ea, in form of a &s;ugar-loaf; the top, however, is plain, and large enough to contain a thou&s;and men drawn up in battalia. In the mid&s;t of this plain there is a fre&s;h-water lake, on the &s;ide of which &s;tands a &s;mall tower three &s;tories high, a &s;tream of pure water gu&s;hes from the &s;ide of the rock, which lies altogether inacce&s;&s;ible, except on the we&s;t &s;ide, by a narrow &s;tair cut out of the &s;tone with great difficulty. Below the rock there is a place where the fi&s;hermen pitch their tents in the cod and ling &s;ea&s;on, and hard by there is good anchorage for their ve&s;&s;els. On the top we likewi&s;e find a chapel, and an ancient pavement. I&s;le&s;ay is, in the &s;ummer, covered with Solan gee&s;e, and other water fowl: it produces hogs, down, and fi&s;h, and belongs to the earl of Ca&s;&s;els. The little i&s;land Avon, about a mile in circumference, and affording a harbour on the north &s;ide, lies &s;outh of the mull of Kintyre.</P>
<P>The i&s;le of Bute, extending ten miles in length, appears on the we&s;t &s;ide of Cowal, from whence it is &s;eparated by a narrow channel. Part of it is rocky and barren; but from the mid|dle &s;outhwards, the ground is cultivated, and produces pea&s;e, oats, and barley. Here is a quarry of red &s;tone, which the natives have u&s;ed in building a fort and chapel in the neigh|bourhood of Roth&s;ay, which is a very ancient royal borough head town, of the &s;hire of Bute and Arran, but very thinly peopled, and main|tained chiefly by the herring-fi&s;hery, with the profits of which all the rents of this i&s;land are chiefly paid. On the north &s;ide of Roth&s;ay we &s;ee the ruins of an ancient fort, with its draw|bridge, chapel, and barracks. Here are like|wi&s;e
<PB N="508" REF="5270">
the remains of &s;ome Dani&s;h towers, &s;uch as Dun-owle and Dun-allin. The natives are healthy and indu&s;trious, &s;peak the Er&s;e and the dia|lect of the Lowlands indifferently, and profe&s;s the Prote&s;tant religion. The i&s;land is divided into two pari&s;hes, accommodated with four churches, and belongs chiefly to the earl of Bute, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an elegant &s;eat near Roth&s;ay: but &s;ome parts are the property of Stuart of E&s;tick, and Ballantine of Keams, who&s;e hou&s;es are well-built and plea&s;antly &s;ituated. To the &s;outhward of Roth&s;ay lie the two &s;mall i&s;lands of Cumbray, belonging to Montgomery of Skellmorly; on the larger is a chapel and a well, the water of which is believed to be a &s;pecific for certain di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>Between the i&s;le of Bute and Kintyre, the i&s;land of Arran pre&s;ents it&s;elf to the view, high and mountainous, affording good pa&s;turage, and extending four and twenty miles from north to &s;outh, the breadth &s;carce amounting to &s;even. This i&s;land produces no timber, yet a few cop|pices are &s;een in different places: here are &s;e|veral lochs and rivers &s;tocked with &s;almon, and wells of medicinal virtue. The herbage on the hills maintain abundance of &s;heep and black cattle, with a con&s;iderable herd of deer re&s;erved by the proprietor, duke Hamilton, for his own diver&s;ion: but as the i&s;land &s;lopes every way towards the coa&s;t, and &s;everal vallies intervene among the mountains, part of the land is cul|tivated and produces tolerable harve&s;ts. Here is plenty of game, though no per&s;on dares kill the heath-cock, without an expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion granted by the duke's &s;teward. This i&s;land af|fords fuller's earth, beautiful chry&s;tals and other pebbles of various colours, which are u&s;ed for &s;eals and jewels. Arran is provided with &s;everal
<PB N="509" REF="5280">
creeks and bays for the convenience of anchor|age; but the only good harbour is Lamla&s;h, on the &s;outh-ea&s;t end of the i&s;land, where cod and whiting are taken in great plenty. On different parts of the coa&s;t, we find caverns, which &s;erved as places of retreat in times of trouble; and various monuments of rude &s;tone, formed in the Dani&s;h manner. On the &s;ea-&s;hore, near the vil|lage of Druim-cruey, there is an eminence, about a thou&s;and paces in compa&s;s, fenced with a &s;tone wall, and formerly allowed as a &s;anctuary for men and cattle. On the we&s;t &s;ide of the bay of Brodick, &s;tands the ca&s;tle of that name, be|longing to the duke, four &s;tories high, provided with a tower, encompa&s;&s;ed with a high wall and wet ditch, having a ba&s;tion on the north &s;ide, and an area capable of holding a battalion of &s;oldiers. The duke's bailiff, or &s;teward, re&s;ides in this ca&s;tle, with full power, by deputation from his grace, to levy rents, grant lea&s;es, and hold courts of ju&s;tice. The proprietor has ano|ther ca&s;tle on the north &s;ide of the i&s;land, at the head of Loch Keni&s;til, in which there is a har|bour for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els. Among the curio&s;ities of this i&s;le, we mu&s;t not omit mentioning the &s;tone globe of St. Molingrus, who was chaplain to the great Macdonald. It is as large as a goo&s;e's egg, of a green colour, and globular &s;hape, &s;uppo&s;ed to contain the inherent virtue of curing &s;titches, if applied to the part affected, and in war, to di&s;concert the enemy, if thrown into the mid&s;t of their army: for this rea&s;on Macdonald is &s;aid to have carried it with him in all his expeditions, which were always crowned with &s;ucce&s;s. The keeping of this &s;tone is the peculiar priviledge of a certain family, known by the name of Mackinto&s;h. They pre&s;erve it carefully wrapped up in a double covering of
<PB N="510" REF="5290">
linen and woollen, and depo&s;ited under lock and key in the &s;ecret part of the hou&s;e, except when it is produced to exerci&s;e its healing qua|lity. The people of Arran are compo&s;ed of different tribes; but the mo&s;t ancient is that of Mac Louis, of French extraction, alias Ful|lerton. The head of this family re&s;ides at Kirk|michel, which is &s;aid to have been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by his ance&s;tors above &s;even hundred years ago. He is, by charter from the duke of Hamilton, hereditary coroner of the i&s;land, and enjoys the perqui&s;ites of that office, which con&s;i&s;t of a bu&s;hel of oats and a lamb from every village in the i&s;land. His bu&s;ine&s;s is to pur&s;ue and &s;ecure all malefactors, and to &s;eize &s;uch tenants as refu&s;e to pay their rents. In the execution of his of|fice, he is attended by three men; but &s;hould the&s;e prove in&s;ufficient, he &s;ummons all the in|habitants to his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and they are obliged to rendezvous at the place where he fixes his coroner's &s;taff. The natives of Arran are &s;trong, healthy, and ingenious, profe&s;s the Prote&s;tant re|ligion, &s;peak the Er&s;e and Engli&s;h languages, and have the convenience of &s;everal churches and chapels, round which they have built vil|lages, the chief being Kilmichel.</P>
