<HEAD>THE

OF THE
Lower Hou&s;e of Convocation of the
Engli&s;h-Clergy Examined, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE Pious Zeal and ju&s;t Concern of the Re|verend
Members of the Lower Hou&s;e of
Convocation, expre&s;s'd again&s;t the late Ex|ce&s;&s;ive
Growth of <HI>Infidelity, Here&s;y,</HI> and <HI>Pro|phanene&s;s,</HI>
in their late Repre&s;entation, and
otherwi&s;e, can never be &s;ufficiently Commended,
or Encouraged. It is hoped no Reader of the&s;e
Remarks, will be &s;o Uncharitable to imagine,
that we are entring the Li&s;ts again&s;t the Convo|cation,
in Defence of the afore&s;aid Abhor'd and
Abominable Crimes of <HI>Infidelity, Here&s;ie and Pro|fanene&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall not either, concern the&s;e Papers in any
part of the Rea&s;ons given by the Right Reverend
the Upper Hou&s;e of Convocation, for their di&s;|agreeing
with the Lower Hou&s;e in the &s;aid Re|pre&s;entation,
which in the Title of the Repre|&s;entation
is called <HI>Rejecting it by the &V;pper-Hou&s;e;</HI>
<PB N="4" REF="3">
otherwi&s;e than ju&s;t to Note in Defence of the &s;aid
Upper Hou&s;e; that however I do not enquire
what their Lord&s;hips Rea&s;ons <HI>were</HI> for the &s;aid Di&s;|agreeing
with the Lower Hou&s;e, which I doubt
not were very good, it may yet be allow'd to
&s;ay Negatively what they <HI>were not,</HI> (<HI>viz.</HI>) Not for
any want of Zeal in their Lord&s;hips again&s;t the
afore&s;aid Crimes, or that their Lord&s;hips were
in the lea&s;t willing to Favour or Encourage <HI>Infide|lity,
Here&s;ie</HI> or <HI>Prophanene&s;s,</HI> which they are very
&s;en&s;ible, have of late exce&s;&s;ively increa&s;ed in the&s;e
Nations, and which they have on all occa&s;ions
given Te&s;timony both of their Concern about,
and their Zeal again&s;t: Nor was it, as is hum|bly
advanc'd in their Lord&s;hip's behalf, that they,
the Upper Hou&s;e, &s;hould not be very willing
upon all Occa&s;ions to join in a regular manner,
and as far as they think their Duty, with the
Lower Hou&s;e, in duly Repre&s;enting to Her
Maje&s;ty the State of Religion, with re&s;pect as
well to the&s;e, as all other Evils that ob&s;truct
the Growth of the true Chri&s;tian Religion in
the&s;e Nations; altho' they could not join in the
&s;everal Additions, as well as &s;ome Circum&s;tances
in the manner, which their Lord&s;hips thought
they had ju&s;t Rea&s;on to di&s;like in the &s;aid Repre|&s;entation.</P>
<P>If any Man plea&s;es to Revi&s;e the Two Differ|ing
Repre&s;entations as they are Publi&s;hed, and
as they both pa&s;&s;ed in the re&s;pective Hou&s;e of
Convocation, they need not be at much Difficul|ty
to find out the Point in which the Two Hou&s;es
Di&s;agreed. And tho' the &s;aid Di&s;agreement is
perhaps the Principal Rea&s;on why the &s;aid Re|pre&s;entations
were re&s;pectively printed, by way
of Appeal to the World; and to give them op|portunity
<PB N="5" REF="4">
to judge of the &s;aid Difference; yet I
&s;hall rather take notice of &s;ome things wherein
the &s;aid Repre&s;entatation differs from the true
State of Religion in <HI>England,</HI> which it is &s;aid to
Repre&s;ent, than of &s;uch things wherein it differs
from the Opinion of the Upper Hou&s;e. Nor &s;hall
I take this by way of Paragraph, as if we were
going to give a particular An&s;wer to the Repre|&s;entation,
but rather Examine, agreeable to our
Title, what is the true State of Religion in this
Nation in the Ca&s;e Repre$ented; and &s;ay &s;ome|thing,
which, had the Reverend Convocation
look'd with an Impartial Eye, into the Circum&s;tan|ces
of the Church, they would have &s;een great
Cau&s;e to have added in the Body of their Re|pre&s;entation,
or to have alter'd the Sub&s;tance of
it, &s;o as that it might have Included the&s;e things
with (or perhaps in&s;tead of) &s;ome of tho&s;e on
which they lay the Great Stre&s;s of their humble
Complaint.</P>
<P>All Men will grant the Truth of the fir&s;t A&s;&s;er|tion
in the Repre&s;entation, (<HI>viz.</HI>) that &startq;a De|luge
of Impiety and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s hath broken
in upon us, and over&s;pread the Face of this
Church and Kingdom, and al&s;o that this is Mat|ter
of Un&s;peakable Grief.&endq;</P>
<P>But it is humbly Referr'd to the Con&s;ideration
of all Impartial Men, that the Source of this De|luge
is not thorowly Traced by the Convoca|tion;
and that had the Reverend Members of
the Committee not fainted in their Search, they
might have gone much farther back than the late
Rebellion, and indeed might have come to a full
&s;top, even at the Native, True, Undoubted
Spring, and Original, to which we all owe the
Progre&s;s of Satan's Kingdom, and the Mon|&s;trous
<PB N="6" REF="5">
Eruption of all manner of Wickedne&s;s i$
the Nation.</P>
<P>This the Reverend Committee &s;eems to own
them&s;elves &s;en&s;ible of, when in &s;peaking of the
<HI>Source</HI> afore&s;aid, they &s;ay with great Mode&s;ty&punc;
as far back as we have Trac'd it, &s;ignifying, tha$
they could have Trac'd it farther back; bu$
being rather willing to have it fix'd upon tho&s;e
Times, than Convinc'd that it ought not to b$$
look'd for &s;omewhere el&s;e, they &s;et down thi$
for its Original; re&s;erving neverthele&s;s a Doo$$
of E&s;cape at this Cautious Parenthe&s;is, (as fa$$
back as we have Trac'd it.) To which it had been
very happy, if they had thought fit to have &s;ub$
&s;ubjoin'd &s;ome Rea&s;ons, as no doubt they ha$
many very good ones to produce, why they Tra$$ced it no farther.</P>
<P>This had &s;erv'd to Silence tho&s;e Unquiet Pha$$
naticks, who alledge that the Convocation have
been Partial in fixing the Source of our <HI>Impiety</HI>
and <HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> at a wrong Period, in order
to blacken their Party, and the Times when they
had the Reins in their hands; while they (th$$
Convocation) knew the true Spring of them lay
father back, where they did not care to look
and that they did not Trace it back farther, for
fear of finding it where it was, and therefore
look for it, where it was not. At the &s;ame time
giving no other Rea&s;on why they place the &s;ai$
Source of our Evil there, than this, viz. (not that
they could not) but that have not Traced $word$
farther back.</P>
<P>Wherefore I humbly crave leave to Remar$$
that in Ju&s;tice to Truth, the Reverend the Co$$mittee of the Convocation, ought, and in Dut$
to the Nature of a True Repre&s;entation, we$$
<PB N="7" REF="6">
oblig'd, be&s;ides their Debt of Sincerity to their
Sovereign, before whom they were laying the
True State of Religion in this Nation, to have
Trac'd the Deluge of the&s;e Impieties, not to a
Suppo&s;ed, but to a True and Real <HI>Source.</HI> And I
<HI>think, with Submi&s;&s;ion,</HI> that it is not a &s;ufficient
Evidence to prove the <HI>Source</HI> of tho&s;e Impieties is
$ound in the late long unnatural Rebellion, to &s;ay
that they have Trac'd it no farther, <HI>&s;ince by that
Rule,</HI> for any thing that appears in this Repre&s;en|$ation,
the &s;aid Source may be any where el&s;e,
$s well as there; and perhaps may be &s;omewhere
$$e and not there.</P>
<P>And that I may with the mo&s;t Impartial Care
$$ther Repre&s;ent the Inju&s;tice of this placing our
$$pieties at the Period afore&s;aid, it is humbly
<HI>$ffered,</HI> That the true <HI>Source</HI> of all this <HI>Deluge of
$$piety,</HI> is rather to be plac'd at that Wretched
$word$ Unhappy Time, when Iniquity was E&s;tab|$$ed
by a Law; when the Sword of Authority,
$$ish God for <HI>the terror of Evil doers,</HI> had put in|$$the
Hands of the Supreme Magi&s;trate, and
which he ought not to <HI>have born in vain,</HI> being
$$tru&s;ted by his Sovereign Lord and Maker, to
$word$ Hands of King <HI>J&mdash;s</HI> the Fir&s;t, for the Pur|$$es
afore&s;aid, was Employ'd by him again&s;t the
$$d that gave him that Authority; and was
$$de an Encourager, and Maintainer of, (nay
$$n a Compeller <HI>of his Subjects</HI> by Violence to)
$word$ manner of <HI>Impiety</HI> and <HI>Licentiou&s;nes;</HI> particu|$$ by
the Publi&s;hing that <HI>Impious, Licentious,</HI>
$$d by all good Chri&s;tians, Adhor'd Proclamation
the Profanation of the Lord's Day, called the
$word$ BOOK OF SPORTS; Condemning as Puri|$$s,
Phanaticks, and Schi&s;maticks, and turning
$word$ of their Livings all tho&s;e Godly, Pious and
<PB N="8" REF="7">
Learned Mini&s;ters of the Church of <HI>England</HI>
&punc; who refu&s;ed to joyn in that War Proclaim'd
SSgain&s;t Heaven, by Reading, again&s;t their Con&s;ci|ences,
that Impious and Abominable Book $word$
their Churches.</P>
<P>Till this Time the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the
Kimgdom of <HI>England,</HI> as the Repre&s;entation &s;ay
well, was <HI>Eminent for Purity of Faith, and Sobri|ty
of Manners.</HI> But from this time forward, &s;h$
grew Noted for Corruption in both.</P>
<P>By this wicked Contrivance, the &s;hame and
Di&s;grace of that Reign, the Morals of the Nation
were entirely Debauch'd. and God's Holy D$$
Prophaned by the King's Commandment. <HI>Then $word$
was,</HI> that the Poor People were &s;et to Sports and
Pa&s;times, on the Day, in which God had Com|manded
<HI>that we &s;hould do no manner of Work.</HI> $word$
if when our Lawful Employments were forbi$den
us, Games and Sports could yet be made
Lawful. <HI>Then et was</HI> that the mo&s;t <HI>Impious</HI> Licen$
was given by the King, that ever was heard of $
this Nation, and which no Chri&s;tian Nation $word$
the World can &s;hew the Parallel to. Where of
Plea&s;urers were the Exerci&s;e of God's Holy Day
in defiance of his Expre&s;s Prohibition, and Con|tempt
of his Gracious Invitation to the &s;tri$$
Ob&s;ervance of that Day, in that Remakable Te$
<HI>I&s;a:</HI> 58. 13. 14. <HI>If thou turn away thy foot from $word$
Sabbath, from doing thy Plea&s;ure on my Holy day
and call the Sabbath a delight, the holy of the Lord
honourable, and &s;halt honour him, not doing thi$
own ways, nor finding thine own plea&s;ure, nor &s;pe$$ing
thine own words. Then &s;halt thou delight $word$
&s;elf in the Lord, and I will cau&s;e thee to ride up
the high places of the Earth, and feed thee with
the heritage of Jacob thy Father; for the mouth$
the Lord hath &s;poken it.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">
In&s;tead of the&s;e &s;trict ob&s;ervings of the Sab|bath,
the fore$aid Impious Proclamation pulls
down the Sacred Sen&s;e of God's Command, and
lays the Sabbath open to the Licentious and A|bominable
Practi&s;e of Sport and Pa&s;times; giving
Licen&s;e to the People to meet together for the
profe&s;s'd Publick horrid In&s;ulting of their Mak|er
in the&s;e very words.</P>
<P>&startq;Our Plea&s;ure likewi&s;e is that after the end
of Divine Service, our good People be not Di&s;|turbed,
Letted or Di&s;couraged from any Law|ful
Recreations on Sundays, or other Holidays;
&s;uch as Dancing, Men or Women, archery
Leaping Vaulting: nor from having may
Games, Whit&s;on-ales, and Morrie Dancing and
&s;etting up May-poles, and other Sports there|with
u&s;ed, &s;o as the &s;ame be had in Convenient
time, without Impediment or neglect of Di|vine
Service. <HI>Vid. Book of Sports, P. 6.&endq;</HI></P>
<P>We &s;hould cau&s;e more of this to be Quoted
but that the thing is &s;o abominable, it &s;eems grie|vous
to write, and a Melancholly thing to be
handed down to Po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Let our Reverend Fathers of the Convocation
be Judges for the Ju&s;tice of this pre&s;ent Remon|&s;trance,
that this is the mo&s;t palpable period of
time; and indeed the only one to which the
Source of the Great Deluge of Impiety and Li|centiou&s;ne&s;s
that is broke in upon us ought to be
trac'd. Nor can they Adjourn the beginning of
tho&s;e things from this time, to the late <HI>&V;nnatural
Rebellion,</HI> unle&s;s it be, becau&s;e that K. <HI>Ch&mdash;s</HI> I. the
Son of the afore&s;aid King <HI>Ja&mdash;s</HI> renew'd the &s;ame
<PB N="10" REF="9">
War again&s;t Heaven, which his Father had
wickedly begun, by Reprinting the &s;aid Procla|mation,
and adding his own Authority to renew
tho&s;e Sports and Pa&s;times, in the Ninth Year of
his Reign; which abominable Practi&s;e was not,
as may be ju&s;tly thought, the lea&s;t occa&s;ion of the
dreadful Plague of Civil War, and Rebellion
which broke out in a few Years after, and which
ended in the De&s;truction of that King, and for a
while in the Subver&s;ion of the Government.</P>
<P>I can not therefore but referr back to tho&s;e
Mi&s;erable Times, when all manner of Wicked|ne&s;s,
Profane&s;s, Contempt of God, and of his
Sabbath, broke in upon this Nation, partly by
the Connivance, and partly by the open Autho|rity
of the Crown.</P>
<P>From this wicked Practice we can not won|der,
if either on the one hand, Licentious People
the re&s;traint of the Law being taken away, took
their ful Liberty to provoke God with open Im|moralities,
or that the Enemies of Revealed Re|ligion
took an Advantage from hence to mock
and make a je&s;t of Religion in General; or that
all manner of Error crept in, where &s;o gro&s;s an
Error led the way, under the &s;helter of Royal
Authority.</P>
<P>From hence began the General Debauching of
the Clergy of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> the Sober,
Pious, Diligent and Learned Mini&s;ters being
every where Turn'd out of their Livings; which
they willingly and chearfully for&s;ook, rather
than Submit to Read that Abominable Book in
their Churches which they fore&s;aw would be <HI>the
Source of all Impiety and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> (the Con|vocations
own words) and likewi&s;e to be found
in Mr. <HI>Perkins</HI> Rea&s;on of the Separation of the
Puritans, <HI>pag.</HI> 16.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
It was, <HI>&s;ays that good Old Chri&s;tian,</HI> an inex|pre&s;&s;ible
Grief of Soul to tho&s;e good Men, to
&s;ee the &s;ame Pulpits, where they had with
Labour, Con&s;cience, and Diligence Unweari|ed,
Preached to their People the Sound Do|ctrines
of the Go&s;pel of Chri&s;t, and thundred
out the Cur&s;es of God's Righteous Law a|gain&s;t
<HI>Sabbath-Breakers,</HI> Riotous Per&s;ons, and
Profaners of God's Holy Ordinances, made
the Trumpetters to Proclaim Satan's King|dom,
to Licen&s;e what God had &s;trictly for|bidden,
under Severe Comination, and the
People Invited to Wickedne&s;s from the &s;ame
Places, and by the Mouths of the &s;ame Mi|ni&s;ters
that u&s;ed to Invite them to Holine&s;s,
and Chri&s;tian Purity; and therefore many
good Men cho&s;e to Suffer the lo&s;s of their
Livings, and for&s;ake their Churches; which
were now become the <HI>Source</HI> of <HI>Impiety</HI> and
<HI>Licentiou&s;ne&s;s.</HI></P>
<P>How unhappy now was it for our Convocati|on,
that being to Repre&s;ent to Her Maje&s;ty the
State of Religion, in their Enquiry into, and
Search after the Source of Impiety and Profane|ne&s;s,
they &s;hould &s;top &s;hort at the late Rebellion,
never look back to the true beginning of the
thing, and FOB Her Maje&s;ty off, only with tel|$ling
Her, they <HI>have</HI> Traced it no farther; which
any body might have known without their tel|ing
it, upon a bare looking over the Repre&s;en|tation.</P>

&s;uppo&s;e Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould have &s;aid to

<PB N="16" REF="15">
and Di&s;affected, being they would not o|bey
the Commands of their Prince, to go to the
Devil the Shorte&s;t Way.</P>
<P>Two things had their beginning at this Period;
and tho' I do not de&s;cend to the Proof of it, for
want of room in this Tract, yet I offer my &s;elf to$$
prove the Fact at any time.</P>
<Q><P>1. <HI>Di&s;&s;enting began here;</HI> and had it not been
for this Abominable Step, there had been no
&s;uch thing known in this Nation, <HI>as a breaking$$
off from the Church;</HI> For the Old <HI>Puritans,</HI> al|tho'
they did Di&s;like &s;ome things, yet they
made it a point of Con&s;cience, not to break
off in Communion from the Church; and
probably never had broken off, if this Vil$
Attempt, of &s;etting up an Allowed Prophana
tion of the Lord's Day had not been made
and they pu&s;h'd at to join in it; which the
refus'd to do, from the very &s;ame Principle
that the Glorious Mrtyrs in Queen <HI>Mary</HI>
Days refu&s;ed Popery; at the price of their
Lives, and the Penalty of Fire and Faggot.</P>
<P>2. The <HI>Deluge of Impiety and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s</HI> be|gan
here, which has &s;ince over&s;pread the
Face of this Nation; and here the Convoca|tion
<HI>might have found it,</HI> If they had thought
fit to have <HI>Trac'd it farder back.</HI> And a$$
the&s;e Reverend Gentlemen, cannot be igno
rant of the Fact, there is no doubt, but th$$
Knowledge they had of its being to be found$$
here, was one principal Rea&s;on, why the$$
<HI>Trac'd it no farther back</HI> than the late Rebe|lion.</P></Q>
<P>Come we next to Enquire Concerning the Pe|riod
where the&s;e Gentlemen have placed it
(<HI>Viz.</HI>) The late Rebellion; from which it ma
<PB N="17" REF="16">
be allowed it had an Addition; tho' I cannot al|low
the Source or beginning to be there, as the
Convocation has alledged; Now, tho' in &s;trict Rea|&s;oning,
this is nothing to the purpo&s;e; becau&s;e,
when People are Tracing a Stream to its Source,
the additional Channels that may add to and en|large
that Stream, are nothing to the Main En|quiry;
(<HI>viz.</HI>) its Source or beginning, which is
the Que&s;tion in hand; yet having fir&s;t prov'd un|denyably,
that the Source or Original of the&s;e
things was not rightly placed; and this I think
is plain, <HI>I &s;hall not &s;tick to grant them,</HI> that tho&s;e
beginnings of Mi&s;chief, <HI>tho' ri&s;en to a Deluge be|fore
the &s;aid War,</HI> yet receiv'd a Great Addition
from the Accident of the &s;aid <HI>Rebellion.</HI></P>
<P>But then it would be Natural to Enquire from
which Party, or from which Side, either of
King or Parliament, during that Unnatural Re|bellion,
the <HI>Deluge of Impiety</HI> afore&s;aid, receiv'd
the greate&s;t Addition: And tho' the mighty
Cry of <HI>Hypocri&s;y</HI> and <HI>Puritani&s;m</HI> which was rai&s;ed
again&s;t the Parliament Party, &s;eems to carry an
acknowledgement with it, that they had at lea&s;t
a greater &s;hew of Religion, and re&s;traint of Man|ners
than ordinary, <HI>whether &s;incere or not, is not
to my purpo&s;e;</HI> Yet it mu&s;t be own'd, the King's
Party were no Hypocrites, but gave them&s;elves
a Liberty in all manner of avowed Wickedne&s;s,
Bla&s;phemy, Oaths, Drunkenne&s;s, and Debauch|ry;
which all their Writers acknowledge, and
the King him&s;elf often &s;poke of with regret, <HI>but
could never re&s;train:</HI> This had certainly &s;ome
&s;hare in the Addition <HI>to the Deluge</HI> afore&s;aid;
&s;ince tho' there may be but little True Religion,
where there is <HI>a great &s;how</HI> of it, yet there is cer|tainly
le&s;s, where there is <HI>no &s;how at all:</HI> And it
<PB N="18" REF="17">
is better for a Nation, <HI>if one of the two Misfor|tunes
mu&s;t befall it,</HI> to have a fal&s;e appearance of$$
Religion, than no Ve&s;tiges or appearance of Re|ligion
at all; For they that pretend to Religion,
tho' fal&s;ly, will put on a &s;hew of Sanctity, and
&s;ome appearance of Morals, whereas the other
with their pretences to Religion, ca&s;t off all pre|tences
to Sobreity of Manners, or to the Rule
of Humanity it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Much of this was the Ca&s;e in the late Unnatu|ral
War; one Side pretended to Religion, '<HI>tis
nothing to me in this Enquiry, whether they did any$$
more than pretend or no,</HI> let that lie as it will$$
but the other pretended to nothing, but gave an
entire Loo&s;e to all manner of Profanene&s;s and
Impiety.</P>
<P>Now whether of the&s;e Contributed mo&s;t to$$
the Encrea&s;ing the Deluge, <HI>for that it was a De|luge
before, has been clearly proved,</HI> of Impiety and$$
Licentiou&s;ne&s;s which is broke in upon this Nati|on,
is for any body to determine.</P>
<P>The Sum of the Matter therefore &s;eems to lie$$
thus, and had the Convocation thought fit to
have acted Impartially, they would have Con|cluded
 it &s;o.</P>
<Q>That the Original and <HI>Source</HI> of that <HI>Deluge</HI> of
Impiety and Licentiou&s;ne&s;s which is broken in
upon this Nation, is to be found in the letting$$
loo&s;e the People to all manner of Liberty, in the
Prophanation of the Lords Day, and taking
off the Re&s;traint of the Laws from them, by the
<HI>Book of Sports;</HI> by which, the Wicked Na
ture of Men being left to its own full &s;wing, run
out into all manner of E$ce&s;s, and that the
&s;ame being Encrea&s;ed on both &s;ides, during the
late &V;nnatural Rebellion, has produc'd in the$$
<PB N="19" REF="18">
Minds of Men, a di&s;regard to the very ap|pearances
of Religion, and is ended in a Spirit of
down right Libertini&s;m and Profanene&s;s,
which have ever &s;ince too much prevail'd upon
us.</Q>
<P>Had the Reverend the Committee thought fit
to have given this hone&s;t account of the thing,
Her Maje&s;ty had then had a True and Im|partial
State of Religion in the Nation, and
all Men would have acquie&s;ced in the Ju&s;tice of
it, as what every good Man acknowledges with
regret.</P>
<P>But this is Prevaricating with Her Maje&s;ty, giv|ing
a partial Repre&s;entation of the Thing, a&s;&s;ign|ing
it to a fal&s;e, and apparently wrong Original,
concealing the Truth, and endeavouring to A|bu&s;e
Her Maje&s;ty, by Loading tho&s;e People with
the Beginnings and Cau&s;e of this Mi&s;chief, who
had no hand in it; and confidently giving &s;uch a
Rea&s;on for their fixing it there, as con&s;i&s;ts nei|ther
with Ju&s;tice to the Ca&s;e it &s;elf, <HI>or good Man|ners
to the Q&V;EEN;</HI> &s;eing to &s;ay they <HI>have
Traced it but &s;o far,</HI> is to imply, they did not
think them&s;elves obliged <HI>to Trace it thoroughly for
Her Maje&s;ties Satisfaction,</HI> but &s;o far only as
might be for their Purpo&s;e, in impo&s;ing upon her
Maje&s;ty, and the whole Nation.</P>
<P>After having thus found them Deficient in the
Searching or <HI>Tracing</HI> this Evil to its True <HI>Source;</HI>
it could not rea&s;onably be expected they &s;hould
give a True Account of its Progre&s;s, or Re&s;traint,
<HI>neither indeed have they done &s;o.</HI></P>
<P>In the Fir&s;t Place, the Repre&s;entation drops
the Subject, and as a thing, which indeed they
fore&s;aw would lie too heavy at la&s;t, where they
did not de&s;ire to feel the weight, they leave the
<PB N="20" REF="19">
Subject of their <HI>Inexpre&s;&s;ible Grief</HI> (viz.) the <HI>De|luge
of Impiety, Licentiou&s;ne&s;s and Profanene&s;s,</HI> and
lay the whole &s;tre&s;s of their Complaint, upon
the Publi&s;hing Bla&s;phemous and Heretical Books
&amp; Notions in the World, in prejudice of the Fun
damentall Doctrine of the Chri&s;tian Faith.</P>
<P>But they Err in the fir&s;t Step, Concerning
what has already, and would again put a check
to this Evil, (<HI>viz.</HI>) Laying it all upon Re&s;train|ing
the Liberty of the Pre&s;s.</P>
<P>This is &s;o Gro&s;s a Mi&s;take, and is aproved &s;o
by Experience and by the Temper and Cu&s;toms
of the People of this Nation, that on the contra|ry,
the Liberty of the Pre&s;s, &s;o far as it is Legal|ly
a Liberty, both is and may be the be&s;t &s;tep to
pull down and put a &s;top to Error, Here&s;ie and
Bla&s;phemous Principles.</P>
<P>The Chri&s;tian Religion, which is founded u|pon
Truth, and &s;eeks Demon&s;tration, has in all
Ages Flouri&s;hed by the Liberty of the Pre&s;s; and
the Re&s;training the Pre&s;s at this Day in Popi&s;h
Countries, by the great Labour of the Inqui&s;iti|on,
is the Rea&s;on why the Reformation can get
no footing in <HI>Spain,</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> in <HI>Portugal,</HI> or
in <HI>Italy.</HI> It has in all tho&s;e Places been the Com|plaint
of the Prote&s;tants, as it was of St. <HI>Augu&s;ting</HI>
in former times, That Chri&s;tians were not al|lowed
to Defend their Doctrine by Writing, and
by force of Rea&s;on and Argument; believing that
the Chri&s;tian, as al&s;o the Prote&s;tant Faith, would
ever gain ground of Error and Here&s;ies, if they
were admitted to Print freely, and di&s;per&s;e their
Writings in its Defence; and Publi&s;h their Expo|&s;itions;
by which the Eyes of the Common Peo|ple
would be Enlighned, and their Under&s;tand|ings
<PB N="21" REF="20">
freed from the Mi&s;ts of Darkne&s;s, Super&s;ti|tion
and Error.</P>
<P>This was the very Ca&s;e in the fir&s;t Reformati|on
in <HI>England;</HI> and the Papi&s;ts finding that the
Doctrine of the <HI>Lollards,</HI> as they call them, or
<HI>Walden&s;es,</HI> &s;pread among the Common People,
by the Reading of the Books of that Famous Man
<HI>John Wicklif,</HI> they immediatly applyed them|&s;elves
to the &s;ame Work now propo&s;ed (and
perhaps for the &s;ame Rea&s;on) (<HI>viz.</HI>) putting a
Re&s;traint upon the Pre&s;s, and de&s;troying all
tho&s;e Books, as far as they could lay their hands
upon them.</P>
<P>Our Clergy are not in&s;en&s;ible, that putting
Legal Re&s;traints upon the Pre&s;s in <HI>Spain,</HI> and in
<HI>Portugal,</HI> is the Rea&s;on that the Bible is kept from
the Laity, and the People kept from the Know|ledge
of the Scriptures; and the having but an
Heretical Book in a Family in tho&s;e Countries,
is enough to bring the Ma&s;ter of that Family in|to
the Inqui&s;ition.</P>
<P>Therefore there is no doubt but putting &s;uch
Re&s;traints upon the Pre&s;s, would &s;uppre&s;s very
much the PRINTING: But I mu&s;t tell them,
it might not &s;uppre&s;s at all the Publi&s;hing tho&s;e
Bla&s;phemous Errors of which they now Com|plain.</P>
<Q><P>1. Becau&s;e they could by no Power in <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
ever expect a Law to prevent Peoples
Reading &s;uch Books, or keeping them in
their Hou&s;es, they could never get leave to
Search Hou&s;es for them, and puni&s;h the
People where they were found; unle&s;s they
could &s;et up a kind of Prote&s;tant Inqui&s;ition
here.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">
2. The Temper of our People being &s;o Curi|ous
after Books, and particularly &s;o after
&s;uch as are Prohibit or forbid, the Searching
for &s;uch Books, would be the readie&s;t Step
they could take, to make People put a Va|lue
upon them, Enquire for them, and Pur|cha&s;e
them, whatever they Co&s;t: As was
Experienced by the Papi&s;ts, in the Ca&s;e of
<HI>Wickliff, Bilney,</HI> and <HI>Tindal</HI>'s Books, in the
14th, 15th, and 16th Century.</P></Q>
<P>But what are the&s;e Legal Re&s;traints they want
We may very well under&s;tand what they mean,
by their telling us what the Succe&s;s was of tho&s;e
they had. It is Evident, the Legal Re&s;traint
they had, was a LICENSER; that is, a
Tyrant of the Pre&s;s. This was cru&s;h'd after|ward,
on the following Rea&s;ons.</P>
<Q><P>1. Becau&s;e it was Illegal in its Nature, being
again&s;t the Right of the Engli&s;h Nation, to
be forbidden freedom of Speech, in their
own Lawful and Ju&s;t Defence. Since were
a Book ever &s;o Nece&s;&s;ary, or Ju&s;t, U&s;eful or
Profitable in a Publick on a Private Ca&s;e, it
lay in the Brea&s;t of &s;uch LICENSER to
Suppre&s;s it, and Silence the Author.</P>
<P>2. Becau&s;e the Management of the Engli&s;h
Government &s;o often &s;hifting Hands, it may
come to pa&s;s, that the Pre&s;s may come whol|ly
into &s;uch Hands, which may put the
&s;ame Oppre&s;&s;ive Injurious Re&s;traint upon
the CHURCH, as was likely to have hap|pen'd,
if King <HI>James</HI> had continued.</P></Q>
<P>3. Becau&s;e it Deprives the Subject of making
the National Oppre&s;&s;ions and Grievances, when
&s;uch happen, known to the People.</P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">
4. If error and Here&s;ie &s;hould ever get the
redominancy in the Government in <HI>England</HI>
which God forbid) the True Religion may
Suffer the &s;ame Yoak.</P>
<P>But after all, we &s;ay farther.</P>
<Q><P>1. There are Sufficient Legal Re&s;traints upon
the Pre&s;s already; &s;ince every Error, Schi&s;m
and Here&s;ie maintained in Print, may be
Pro&s;ecuted by our Laws, may be condemn'd
and the Per&s;on Cen&s;ured for the &s;ame, and
Puni&s;hed, whether Author, or Publi&s;her,
or both, as is evident in the Governments
daily Pro&s;ecuting Seditious Books; the &s;ame
Law being in Force again&s;t Heretical Bla&s;|phemous
Libels; and the Fault is rather the
Church not putting &s;uch Laws in Executi|on,
and duly Pro&s;ecuting &s;uch People, ra|ther
than want of Laws to Pro&s;ecute upon.</P>
<P>2. This is all a kind of a Tacit Acknowledg|ment
of the weakne&s;s of the Chri&s;tian Do|ctrine,
or the Incapacity of the Church of
<HI>England's</HI> Divines to Defend it; and the
Jealou&s;ie they &s;eem to have, that Error and
Here&s;ie &s;hould get Ground of them by Di&s;|putation.
The contrary to which is, what
our Divines of the Church of <HI>England</HI> have
all along pretended to; witne&s;s Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI>'s
Challenge to the Di&s;&s;enters, wherein he
&s;ays, All the Church of <HI>England</HI> Divines de|&s;ire
is, to have People come fairly and pro|po&s;e
their Doubts, and make due Enquiry
after Truth, that they may hear what both
Sides have to &s;ay, and Determine for them|&s;elves.</P></Q>
<P>But this Pretence of having the Pre&s;s Re&s;train|$is
Declaring the Church, of <HI>England</HI> is not
<PB N="24" REF="23">
able to &s;tand her Ground again&s;t Here&s;ie an
Schi&s;m in Matters of Di&s;pute; and therefor$
like Mon&s;ieur <HI>Jurieu</HI> at the <HI>Hague,</HI> Di&s;puti$$
with Mr. S&mdash;<HI>is,</HI> when he found his Adver&s;a$$
was too hard for him, he Petition'd the STATE
that Mr. <HI>S&mdash;is</HI> might not be permitted to Wri$
any more again&s;t him. Or, as the Examin|lately
against the <HI>Medley;</HI> who finding him&s;elf
Oppre&s;s'd with the <HI>Medly's</HI> Arguments, Cri$out
to have the Mini&s;try puni&s;h him for it.</P>
<P>Ju&s;t thus the Fam'd Dr. <HI>Calamy</HI> (a|bove-mentioned)
did by Mr. <HI>Delaun$</HI>
who Accepted the Doctor's Challenge
which, as I have Noted, he made t$
all the <HI>Di&s;&s;enters,</HI> to come and have
their Doubts fairly Di&s;cu&s;&s;ed. But
when the Dr. found his Challenge was
Accepted, by a Man of Superior Learn|ing
to him&s;elf, Cau&s;ed the Book to be
Cru&s;ed at the Printing-Hou&s;e, by the
&s;ame Legal Re&s;traint upon the Pre&s;s
which the Convocation now are De&s;i|ring,
and his Antagoni&s;t was mo&s;t Ef|fectually
Silenced, by Peri&s;hing in a
Jayle.</P>
<Q>This was the way that <HI>Stephen Gard|ner</HI>

the <HI>Prote&s;tant Doctrine,</HI> the Orthodox
Foundation of the Church of <HI>England
Principles,</HI> and the Ability of her D I|VINES
to <HI>Defend it,</HI> Contemn the
A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Force to Suppre&s;s Error;
and to An&s;wer Arguments with Vio|lence.</P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, they have on all
Occa&s;ions, powerfully Re&s;i&s;ted, and
Succe&s;sfully al&s;o, all the Errors of the
Times, to this Day; and have now &s;et
about that mo&s;t Effectual Step to fix a
good Foundation of RELIGION
in Po&s;terity, as the be&s;t Means to fix
them in the Truth, and Fortifie them
again&s;t Here&s;ie; <HI>and this is,</HI> the Early
In&s;truction of Youth, Breeding Chil|dren
up in a clear Under&s;tanding of the
<PB N="26" REF="25">
fir&s;t Principles of the Chri&s;tian Religi|on;
which, <HI>if well pur&s;ued,</HI> there would
be le&s;s Danger of the Corruption of Er|ror
taking Place among them. And
this will do more towards E&s;tabli&s;hing
the Minds of the People, again&s;t the
Contagion of Here&s;ie, than all the
Empty Negatives of keeping Ill Book
out of their Hands.</P>
<P>To this, <HI>they might have joyned</HI> a &s;teady
Pro&s;ecution of the Law again&s;t every
Erroneous Book, either in the Name o$
them&s;elves, or in the Name and Autho|rity
of the Government, which no

Direct and allow; would in
a few Years be totally and effectually
Di&s;couraged, and Suppre&s;s'd.</P>
<P>One Thing more might be added

that can be taken; towards the taking
away all Danger of the Peoples being
Debauched into Error; and the Omi&s;|&s;ion
of which, perhaps is at pre&s;ent the
Chief Rea&s;on why they are &s;o ea&s;ily led
<PB N="27" REF="26">
away from the Church. <HI>And this is</HI> the
Effectual Reformation of the Clergy of

how the State of Religion, which is $
pre&s;ent thus Declining, may be Re|&s;tored; the Number of Di&s;&s;enters Le|&s;ened,
the Bla&s;phemy, Errors and In|fidelity
of the Age Suppre&s;s'd, without
Running &s;uch Lengths as the Repre&s;en|tation
