<HEAD>MEMOIRS Of the LIFE of Mrs. <HI>Anne Oldfield</HI>.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Lo&s;s which the polite Part of the Town has &s;u&s;tained, in the Death of Mrs. OLDFIELD, mu&s;t be allowed to be irrepara|ble; becau&s;e, in Comedy, as &s;he never had, &s;o &s;he has not left, her Equal.</P>
<P>Mrs. ANNE OLDFIELD was born in <HI>Pall-Mall</HI>, in the Year 1683. Her Grandfather was a Vintner, but on her Mother's Side &s;he was well de&s;cended. Her Father rode in the Guards, and I have heard had a Commi&s;&s;ion under King JAMES before he died. By his free Way of Living, he not only run out his In|come, but likewi&s;e &s;pent a very pretty Paternal E&s;tate. His Daughter was put to Mrs. <HI>Wotton</HI>, a Semp&s;tre&s;s in <HI>King-&s;treet We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>, but her Genius for the Stage was predominant, as appeared by her continual reading and re|peating Parts of Plays. Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> being left in &s;trait Circum&s;tances, She and her Daughter lived for &s;ome time with her
<PB N="2" REF="3">
Si&s;ter Mrs. <HI>Vo&s;s</HI>, who kept the Mitre Ta|vern in St. <HI>James</HI>'s Market. She married a Second Husband, one <HI>Wood</HI>. Her Daughter Mrs. <HI>Anne Oldfield</HI> was introduced to Mr. CHRISTOPHER RICH, by the late Sir JOHN VANBRUGH, in the Year 1699. About which time Mrs. <HI>Cro&s;s</HI> having made an Excur&s;ion to <HI>France</HI>, with a certain Baronet, Mrs. <HI>Old|field</HI>'s <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Appearance on the Stage was in a Part of Her's, <HI>viz.</HI> CANDIOPE, in <HI>Secret Love:</HI> Or, the <HI>Maiden Queen</HI>; a Tragi-Comedy, writ|ten by Mr. DRYDEN.</P>
<P>HER <HI>Second</HI> Appearance was in a more Capital Part, ALINDA, in the <HI>Pilgrim</HI> of BEAUMONT and FLETCHER, in which Sir JOHN VANBRUGH made &s;ome <HI>Alterations</HI>, and Mr. DRYDEN wrote a <HI>Ma&s;que</HI>, to ren|der the Revival of this Play more agreeable to the Town, together with a New <HI>Prologue</HI> and <HI>Epilogue</HI>. The <HI>Pilgrim</HI> was indeed re|vived for the Benefit of Mr. DRYDEN, <HI>Ann.</HI> 1700, but he dying on the third Night of its Repre&s;entation, his Son attended the Run of it, and the Advantages accrued to his Fa|mily. About three Years after, upon the Decea&s;e of that eminent Actre&s;s Mrs. VER|BRUGGEN, who died in Child-bed, Mrs. <HI>Old|field</HI> &s;ucceeded her in the Part of Lady <HI>Lurewell</HI>, in the <HI>Con&s;tant Couple</HI>: Or, a <HI>Trip</HI> to the <HI>Jubilee</HI>, written by Mr. FAR|QUHAR, which run Fifty-two Nights. But
<PB N="3" REF="4">
the Part that render'd Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Ex|cellence chiefly known to the Town, was that of Lady <HI>Betty Modi&s;h</HI>, in the <HI>Carele&s;s Husband</HI>, a Comedy, written by Mr. CIBBER, in the Year 1704. In this Character it was that tho&s;e two Qualities, before ob&s;erved by Mr. CIBBER, of the <HI>Genteel</HI> and the <HI>Elegant</HI>, &s;hone out in Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> to their greate&s;t Degree of Perfection; and the Character was &s;o admirably &s;uited to the natural and agree|able Manner of Conver&s;ation peculiar to Mrs. OLDFIELD, that almo&s;t every Sen|tence, in the Part, may with Ju&s;tice be &s;aid to have been heard from her own Mouth be|fore &s;he pronounced it on the Stage. In &s;hort, it was not the Part of Lady <HI>Betty Mo|di&s;h</HI>, repre&s;ented by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>; but it was the real Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> who appeared in the Character of Lady <HI>Betty Modi&s;h</HI>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Year, the Royal Company of Comedians went down to <HI>Bath</HI>, where, among &s;everal Plays acted by them during the Sea&s;on, Mi&s;s <HI>Campion</HI>, not only by her Action, but her Singing and Dancing, had &s;o far captivated the mo&s;t noble WILLIAM Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>, Father of the late Duke, that he took her off the Stage. Of this Amour farther Mention will be hereafter made; becau&s;e it is intended that the&s;e Me|moirs &s;hall not only, with the utmo&s;t Fide|lity, con&s;i&s;t of a Recital of the peculiar Ex|cellencies of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, but likewi&s;e

contain a &s;hort digre&s;&s;ionary Hi&s;tory of the Fate and Fortunes of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable Actre&s;&s;es during the &s;ame Period of Time: an Attempt which I hope will not be le&s;s u&s;eful than entertaining to every Reader.</P>
<P>IT is well known, that about this Time, a &s;trict Alliance of Friend&s;hip had com|menced between <HI>Arthur Maynwaring</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>. Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI>, who wrote the Life of Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>, a&s;&s;ures the Public,
<Q>&startq;That each of them loved with a Pa&s;&s;ion, that could hardly have been &s;tronger, had it been both <HI>Hers</HI> and &endq;<HI>His</HI> fir&s;t Love.</Q>
<NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See Mr.</HI> Maynwaring<HI>'s</HI> Life, 8<HI>vo.</HI> pag. 43 &amp;c.</NOTE> It was doubtle&s;s ow|ing, in a great Mea&s;ure, to his In&s;tructions, that Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> became &s;o admirable a <HI>Player</HI>, for as no body under&s;tood the <HI>Action</HI> of the <HI>Stage</HI> better than him&s;elf, &s;o no body took greater Plea&s;ure than he to &s;ee her excel in it. He wrote &s;everal <HI>Prologues</HI> and <HI>Epilogues</HI> for her, and would always hear her rehear&s;e them in private before &s;he &s;poke them in public: I &s;hall in&s;ert Part of one, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The <HI>Epilogue</HI> to the <HI>Wife's Relief:</HI> Or, The <HI>Husband's Cure</HI>. A Comedy written by Mr. <HI>Charles John&s;on</HI>.</NOTE> to which in the Speaking &s;he gave an inimitable Turn of Humour; being an agreeable Di&s;play of the Manner how the Ladies would Go|vern under a <HI>Feminine Monarchy</HI>.</P>

<P>Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s Friends, &s;ome of whom were of the highe&s;t Rank, of both Sexes of|ten blamed him, nay, have had &s;uch Quarrels with him concerning this Affair, that even Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> her&s;elf has frequently repre&s;ented to him, that it was for his <HI>Honour</HI> and <HI>Inte|re&s;t</HI> to break off their <HI>Alliance</HI>, which open Frankne&s;s, on her Side, did as he has often confe&s;&s;ed, engage him to her the more firm|ly, and all his Friends at la&s;t, gave over im|portuning him to leave her. They &s;aw, by her mo&s;t engaging Manner, that &s;he daily, and hourly, more and more entangled him in <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Nets, and it mu&s;t be allowed that Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> is not the only wi&s;e Man who has fallen a Victim to <HI>Venus</HI>. He real|ly &s;u&s;tained a greater Weight of the public Affairs, than &s;ome who&s;e Po&s;ts more imme|diately load them with the Burthen. His very great Intimacy and Friend&s;hip with my Lord <HI>Godolphin</HI> and the Duke of <HI>Marl|borough</HI>,
<PB N="7" REF="8">
who were then at the Head of the Mini&s;try, could not but nece&s;&s;arily involve him in Political Re&s;earches, and it was to unbend his Mind that he took Delight to pa&s;s &s;ome Hours with a Woman, who&s;e Conver|&s;ation was both &s;oft and plea&s;ant, and exactly agreeable to his own. It is not to be &s;up|po&s;ed that two Per&s;ons under &s;uch an Affec|tionate Alliance, could meet without Con&s;um|mation; and all the Quarter that is de&s;ired for Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s Reputation in this Tran&s;action of his Life, is, that none but the Innocent would condemn him. For what Mr. <HI>Fenton</HI> has ob&s;erved of the <HI>Primitive State</HI>, may be ju&s;tly applied to the Satisfaction they en|joyed in each other.</P>
<Q><L>Pure from Deceit, devoid of Fear and Strife,</L>
<L>While Love was all the pen&s;ive Care of Life.</L></Q>
<P>IT cannot be denied, but this Amour was very expen&s;ive to Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>, tho' it was not the only erroneous In&s;tance of his Oeconomy. No Man could have a greater Contempt for Money, or abhorred what was mean and &s;ordid more than he did: And it was wholly owing to his Genero&s;ity and Negli|gence of his own Affairs, that after he had &s;o profitable a Po&s;t, as Auditor of the Impre&s;t conferred on him, yet he made no Addition to his Fortune. When he &s;old his E&s;tate of <HI>Ight|field</HI> in <HI>Shrop&s;hire</HI>, to my Lord <HI>Kilmurry</HI>, there
<PB N="8" REF="9">
was not, when the Mortgages were paid off, above four Thou&s;and Pounds left to be divided between him and his Si&s;ter. The Management of his Dome&s;tic Affairs he gave intirely up to his Si&s;ter and Servants; and tho&s;e that knew what was the Conduct of his Family at <HI>White|hall</HI>, never thought that he would be the richer for his Po&s;t. His Company was &s;o much the Delight of the <HI>Great</HI>, the <HI>Fair</HI> and the <HI>Gay</HI>, that he was very little at Home. However, we mu&s;t leave him for a while in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Po&s;t; made happy, at certain Intervals, by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, in who&s;e Conver&s;ation all his Political Fatigues were mo&s;t agreeably alle|viated.</P>
<P>ABOUT this Time, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Stage met with as much Oppo&s;ition as the <HI>State</HI>. No|thing would go down but <HI>Italian</HI> Operas, and indeed Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>, being a Lover of Mu|&s;ic, and a fine Performer him&s;elf, gave into this Polite Ta&s;te, and wrote the following <HI>Prologue</HI> to CAMILLA.</P>

<P>BUT let it here be ob&s;erved, that tho' Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>'s Love of Mu&s;ic made him give &s;ome Encouragement to the <HI>Italian</HI> Operas; yet he was a fa&s;t Friend and vigo|rou&s;ly pu&s;hed all his Intere&s;t, both for pro|moting and improving the Entertainment of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Theatre, being truly &s;en&s;ible of this Remark,

<P>WE mu&s;t now return to Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, ri&s;ing every Sea&s;on in Reputation, from her inimitable Performance, fir&s;t acquired under
<PB N="10" REF="11">
the Character of Lady <HI>Betty Modi&s;h</HI>, and in which &s;he &s;hone more, than in all the Parts wherein &s;he had hitherto appeared.</P>
<P>THE Author of the <HI>Carele&s;s Husband</HI>, thus impartially &s;tates the Ca&s;e, to his mo&s;t noble Pa|tron the Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI>:
<Q>&startq;The be&s;t Criticks have long and ju&s;tly complained, that the Coar&s;ene&s;s of mo&s;t Characters in our late Co|medies have been unfit Entertainments for <HI>People</HI> of <HI>Quality</HI>, e&s;pecially the <HI>Ladies:</HI> And therefore, <HI>&s;ays he</HI>, I was long in hopes that &s;ome able Pen, who&s;e Expectation did not hang upon the Profits of Succe&s;s, would ge|nerou&s;ly attempt to reform the Town into a <HI>better Ta&s;te</HI> than the World generally allows them: But nothing of that Kind having lately appeared, that would give an Opportunity of being wi&s;e at another's Expence, I found it impo&s;&s;ible any longer to re&s;i&s;t the &s;ecret Temptation of my Vanity, and &s;o e'en &s;truck the fir&s;t Blow my&s;elf: And the Event has now convinced me, <HI>that whoever &s;ticks clo&s;e to</HI> Na|ture, <HI>cannot ea&s;ily write above the Under&s;tand|ing of the</HI> Galleries, <HI>tho' at the &s;ame time he may may po&s;&s;ibly de&s;erve Applau&s;e of the</HI> &endq;Boxes.</Q></P>
<P>THIS <HI>Play</HI>, before its Tryal on the Stage, was examined by &s;everal People of Qua|lity, who came into the Duke of <HI>Argyll</HI>'s Opi|nion of its being a ju&s;t, a proper, and diverting
<PB N="11" REF="12">
Attempt in Comedy; but few of them carried the Compliment beyond their private Approba|tion:
<Q>&startq;For, &s;ays Mr. <HI>Cibber</HI>, when I was wi&s;hing for a little farther Hope, they &s;topt &s;hort of your <HI>Grace</HI>'s Penetration, and only <HI>wi&s;hed</HI> me what they &s;eemed to <HI>fear</HI>, and you a&s;&s;ured me of, a <HI>general Succe&s;s</HI>. And, if the Dialogue of <HI>this Comedy</HI> flows with a more ea&s;y Turn of Thought and Spirit, than what I have u&s;ually produced; I &s;hall not yet blame &s;ome People for &s;aying <HI>it is not my own</HI>, unle&s;s they know at the &s;ame Time I owe mo&s;t of it to the many &s;tolen Ob&s;erva|tions I have made from your <HI>Grace</HI>'s Manner &endq;of Conver&s;ing.</Q></P>
<P>I SHOULD not have dwelt &s;o long on this Play, were it not the Period from whence we may date the Birth of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> as an Actre&s;s. And, to demon&s;trate how exactly the Drama|tical-Pencil has delineated her <HI>real Character</HI>, under the <HI>imaginary one</HI> of Lady <HI>Betty Modi&s;h</HI>, I &s;hall, both for the Reader's Entertainment and Information, refer him to the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> Scene of the <HI>&s;econd</HI> Act of the Play, between Lady <HI>Mo|di&s;h</HI> and Lady <HI>Ea&s;y</HI>; wherein the De&s;criptions given of the Allurements of Dre&s;s, and other captivating Charms, of Wit, Raillery and Con|ver&s;ation, for which Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> was &s;o peculi|arly remarkable, make it appear &s;elf-eivdent, that none but <HI>&s;he</HI> could have &s;at for the Picture.</P>
<P><PB N="12" REF="13">IT mu&s;t here be noted, that, the Summer before the Appearance of the <HI>Carele&s;s Husband</HI> on the Stage, Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> and Mrs. <HI>Old|field</HI> &s;pent the Rece&s;s of a whole long Vacation at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI>, the Scene of that Comedy, where they lodged in the Ca&s;tle, at the Hou&s;e of Mr. <HI>John Sewell</HI>, Trea&s;urer and Chapter-Clerk to the Dean and College. The Application of this Hint, I &s;ubmit to the Reader's Judgment, when he has con&s;ider'd the <HI>Interview</HI> between the <HI>two Ladies</HI> abovementioned.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>Chit-chat</HI> of Lady <HI>Betty Modi&s;h</HI>, may be found the fine Raillery of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>. It was her Wit that made her Company always acceptable to Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Rank; and as to her outward Appearance, it was beautiful without Artifice, and her Addre&s;s engaging with|out Affectation.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t now return to Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>, who being made happy by Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> with the Birth of a Son, it was &s;uch a Rivet to <HI>Cupid</HI>'s Chains, as bound him much fa&s;ter to his <HI>Venus</HI>. However, Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> made a &s;erious Ap|plication of this natural Incident; and &s;et a firm Re&s;olution to him&s;elf of regula|ting his future Conduct. He reduced all his Expences to &s;tated Allowances, and laid by a con&s;iderable Part of the Income of his Audi|tor&s;hip, &s;aying, <HI>He had been &s;uch a Fool as to
<PB N="13" REF="14">
de&s;pi&s;e Money till then, but now he would do as other Men did, and endeavour to grow Rich</HI>. But this Re&s;olution was formed too late; for his Company was &s;o much the Delight of the Great, the Fair and the Gay, that he was very little at Home. He drank freely, and as his Wines were generally <HI>Champagne</HI> and <HI>Burgun|dy</HI>, it was to their corro&s;ive Qualities that he im|puted the ill State of Health he was fallen in|to; and has often &s;poken with Concern, of the Misfortune it had been to him, that People thought his Conver&s;ation &s;o agreeable, as to expo&s;e him to Intemperance. However, Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> by her Care, and tender Affection for him, pro|longed his Life &s;ome Years; and her Genero&s;i|ty has been &s;o great, towards his Son, that &s;he has, by her La&s;t Will and Te&s;tament, bequeathed him a Legacy much more than double the E&s;|tate his Father left, be&s;ides other Provi&s;ions made for him. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>See</HI> No. I. <HI>and</HI> II. <HI>of the</HI> Appendix.</NOTE></P>

The <HI>Number</HI> of Nights, and the common Method of filling the <HI>Hou&s;e</HI>, are not always the &s;ure&s;t Marks of judging what En|couragement a Play meets with: But the Ge|nero&s;ity of all the Per&s;ons of a refined Ta&s;te a|bout Town was remarkable on this Occa&s;ion: And it mu&s;t not be forgotten how zealou&s;ly Mr. <HI>Addi&s;on</HI> e&s;pou&s;ed its Intere&s;t, with all the elegant Judgment and diffu&s;ive Good-nature, for which that accompli&s;hed Gentleman was &s;o ju&s;tly valued by Mankind.

Concern for the unknown Offence, but he was too near Death, and in a few Hours after &s;he had left him, he expired in the Arms of his Servant Mr. <HI>Thomas Wood</HI>, now Trea&s;urer of the Theatre in <HI>Lincolns-Inn</HI> Fields, on the 12th of <HI>November</HI>, 1712, in the Prime of his Age, being but 44 Years old.</P>
<P>AFTER his Decea&s;e, a mo&s;t &s;candalous and fal&s;e Rumour was &s;pread, chiefly levelled at Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, that he died of a Venereal Malady. But to obviate &s;o ungenerous a Reflection, his Body, by her Direction, was opened by two Surgeons &mdash;Mr. <HI>Bu&s;&s;iere</HI> and Mr. <HI>Browne</HI>; in the Pre&s;ence of two Phy&s;icians, Dr. <HI>Bee&s;ton</HI> and Dr. <HI>We&s;t</HI>; and of his Apothecary Mr. <HI>Buck|eridge</HI>.</P>
<P>The&s;e Gentleman, all, declared, that there was not the lea&s;t Symptom of any thing <HI>Venere|al</HI>; but that he died of a Con&s;umption. He had in his Life-time, heard the Whi&s;perings of ma|licious Rumour, charging him with &s;uch an In|di&s;po&s;ition; but he once complained very pa|thetically to He, that he was not con&s;cious of any &s;uch Di&s;temper; confe&s;&s;ing at the &s;ame time, that, in the Reign of King <HI>William</HI>, he had made an unfortunate Sally in an Amour, which gave him a &s;light Taint at <HI>Paris</HI>, 1698; that he was only patcht up there, but afterwards perfectly cured at <HI>London</HI>, &s;ince which Time he never had any &s;uch Misfortune.</P>
<P>IT is the Duty of an Hi&s;torian to &s;peak the Truth, as far as it comes to his Knowledge,
<PB N="29" REF="30">
and as great a Veneration as I have for Mr. <HI>Mayn|waring</HI>'s Memory, I could not avoid mentioning even this Blemi&s;h of it, in Ju&s;tice, and to clear up the unju&s;t A&s;per&s;ion ca&s;t on Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>.</P>
<P>IT was not long before his Death, that he made his Will, all which he wrote with his own Hand, and to which his Apothecary Mr. <HI>Buckeridge</HI>, and his Servant Mr. <HI>Wood</HI>, were Witne&s;&s;es, when it wat executed at Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Hou&s;e in <HI>South|ampton-Street, Covent-Garden</HI>. He charged them not to take any Notice of what they knew; which however was little enough, for he intru&s;ted no body with the Secret of his having made Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> his Executrix, tho' by her Behaviour to him, he could not in Ju&s;tice do otherwi&s;e, on his Son's Account; nor could any Woman better de|&s;erve all that was in his Power to give; of which Truth his Son is a living Witne&s;s.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the Clamour his Will made, after his Decea&s;e; him&s;elf, who be&s;t knew what he had to leave her, could not im|gine &s;uch a Stir would have been made about &s;o &s;mall an E&s;tate. He was far from dying Rich, leaving evry little more than Three Thou&s;and Pounds behind him, which he divided equal|ly between his Si&s;ter, his Son's Mother, and the Child, who, in Feature and Vivacity, was very like his Father. Often have I heard Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> bemoan the Child, and &s;ay, <HI>What will become of the Boy when I am gone</HI>. This Anxiety proceeded from the <HI>Little</HI> he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed. It is true he had &s;uch a noble Contempt
<PB N="31" REF="31">
of the Goods of Fortune, that he never took Care to make one, nor ever re&s;olved to grow Rich.</P>
<P>HAD I a Talent for Panegyric, I could be proud of this Opportunity to do Ju&s;tice to the Memory of a Gentleman, who&s;e Name would be Immortal, had not his Mode&s;ty been as great as his Merit; had he not contented him|&s;elf with the <HI>Plea&s;ure</HI> of Writing, and re&s;igned the <HI>Glory</HI> of it to others. As to the Author of the <HI>Medley</HI>, the <HI>Examiner</HI> was obliged to allow that he wrote with <HI>a Tolerable Spirit, and in a Ma&s;terly Style</HI>. A <HI>Spirit</HI>, indeed, which has not many Equals, and a <HI>Style</HI> worthy the Imi|tation of the greate&s;t Ma&s;ters. His Learning was without Pedantry; his Wit Affectation; his Judgment, without Malice; his Friend&s;hip, without Intere&s;t; his Zeal, without Violence; in a Word, he was the be&s;t Subject, the be&s;t Relation, the be&s;t Ma&s;ter, the be&s;t Critic, and be&s;t Political Writer in <HI>Great-Britain</HI>.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after his Decea&s;e, was publi&s;h|ed <HI>a Defence of</HI> Mr. <HI>Maynwaring, in a Letter to a Friend</HI>. It was, Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> a&s;&s;erts <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See the <HI>Po&s;thumous Works</HI> of Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> publi&s;hed by him, <HI>pag. 351.</HI></NOTE>, &s;uppo&s;ed to be written by the Right Honourable <HI>Robert Walpole</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and is not unworthy &s;o good a Hand for its Genero&s;ity, Spirit; and Ele|gance, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I write to you upon a Circum&s;tance, for which it is the Intere&s;t of all Mankind to be concerned. The Public is under the Admini&s;|tration of its re&s;pective Mini&s;ters and Officers, who are obliged by their Po&s;ts to con&s;ult the true Welfare of it. But Incidents, which hap|pen alike to all, and from which no Man can be exempt, fall under every Man's Care, and are to be con&s;idered and laid home to the Bo|&s;om of every Man breathing. It is incumbent upon each individual Per&s;on, for his own &s;ake, to <HI>defend</HI> the <HI>Ab&s;ent</HI>; but much more &s;o to <HI>defend the Dead</HI>, who are to be <HI>ab&s;ent for ever</HI>. I have Rea&s;ons for thinking I am called to this Duty, upon the accidental Peru&s;al of a virulent Libel, <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>See the</HI> EXAMINER February 9<HI>th</HI>, 1712. 13.</NOTE> wherein the Author, after much Di&s;|cour&s;e about <HI>him&s;elf</HI>, has (alluding to a Gentle|man who lately departed this Life) the follow|ing Words, <HI>viz.</HI>
<Q>&startq;Suppo&s;e I were al&s;o to tell the World, That the mo&s;t active Enemy again&s;t this <HI>Paper</HI>, was <HI>one</HI> who got to be poor in the <HI>Jacobite Cau&s;e</HI>, and then run over in|to <HI>Two</HI> de&s;perate Extreams, and was re&s;olved at once to grow Rich and Hone&s;t in the Cau&s;e of the <HI>Whigs</HI>. That outlived his Works a little too long; till having parted with Religion and Morality, he threw away his Honour in a carele&s;s manner after it, together with his Humanity and natural Affection to
<PB N="32" REF="33">
a kind Si&s;ter, his E&s;tate, Fortune, and even the Vouchers belonging to his Office: All which were be&s;towed, as Monumental Le|gacies of <HI>Whig Hone&s;ty</HI>, on a celebrated ACTRSES, who is too much admired <HI>upon the Stage</HI>, to have any Enquiry made in her &endq;Conduct <HI>behind the Curtain</HI>.</Q></P>
<P>THE Per&s;on here levelled at, (Mr. <HI>Mayn|waring</HI>) was, in his younger Days, tinctured with <HI>Jacobiti&s;m</HI>; an Error no Man ever re|nounced more heartily, and with greater Ab|horrence of it than he did. He was a Man of great Mode&s;ty, and could not exert him&s;elf in Public Places, or in mixt Company; but when, in Proce&s;s of Time, his Talents grew con&s;picu|ous, in &s;pite of a ba&s;hful Nature, he was invit|ed and courted into a Familiarity with Men in the highe&s;t Power, and of the greate&s;t Abilities in the Kingdom, to whom his Conver&s;ation was both a Plea&s;ure and a Service. Then it was that his Words and Actions fir&s;t began to manife&s;t the Principles in which he lived and died. He had the highe&s;t Obligations to that great Mini&s;ter, <HI>Sidney</HI>, Ear of <HI>Godol|phin</HI>, Lord High Trea&s;urer, and enjoyed by his Favour, an Office for Life (<HI>Auditor of the Impre&s;t</HI>.) After the Removal of that noble Lord from the Trea&s;ury, the <HI>Examiner</HI> thought fit to di&s;parage his Services, by In&s;inuations and Reflections, which the Gentleman, of whom we are talking, had too much Gratitude to
<PB N="33" REF="34">
here without Indignation. This I take to be the Provocation which moved the <HI>Examiner</HI> to utter this reproachful Language again&s;t him; among which he falls into the Error of &s;aying, <HI>He outlived his Works; but Works of his, which outlive him</HI>, will let us into the <HI>Secret</HI> of this <HI>cruel Behaviour</HI>. The <HI>Medley</HI> was often writ|ten by (Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI>) this <HI>active Enemy</HI> of the <HI>Examiner</HI>, in which &s;o many gro&s;s <HI>Fal&s;|hoods</HI> of <HI>that</HI> Writer were detected, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>MEDLEY NO. 41,</HI> relating to the Act of <HI>Indemnity</HI>. See al&s;o <HI>MEDLEY NO. 443,</HI> concerning the <HI>State Loans</HI>.</NOTE> that he had recour&s;e to <HI>Detraction</HI> rather than a <HI>ju&s;t Defen&s;e</HI> of him&s;elf, for which he had been call|ed upon by Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> in &s;everal &s;ub&s;e|quent Papers.</P>
<P>FROM hence it appears, that the <HI>Examiner</HI>'s Treatment of this Gentleman, is as ju&s;t as it would be in a Felon to publi&s;h a Libel again&s;t the late Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Holt</HI>, for pa&s;&s;ing Sen|tence upon him to be burnt in the Cheek. The <HI>Examiner</HI> has Sen&s;e enough tho' not Grace enough, to know, that to <HI>de&s;erve</HI>, not to <HI>&s;uffer</HI> Puni&s;hment, is truly &s;hameful; but none but a Man enraged, as in the &s;uppo&s;ed Ca&s;e of the Fe|lon, and incapable of Remor&s;e and Shame, could forget all Regards to the Advantage his Adver|&s;ary had in the Di&s;pute, all Tenderne&s;s with Relation to a Man's private Affairs, &s;o far as to mention the Particulars of the Gentleman's <HI>Si&s;|Si&s;ter</HI>,
<PB N="34" REF="35">
and his Pa&s;&s;ion for an <HI>Actre&s;s</HI>. This Account with his <HI>Si&s;ter</HI>, I am very &s;ure the <HI>Examiner</HI> can be no Judge of, nor any one but the Gentleman him&s;elf. The Offence his Pa&s;&s;ions (for Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>) gave, to all who e&s;|teemed him, is to be lamented, but not to be mentioned with the&s;e Aggravations, e&s;pecially after his Death, and that when he who &s;peaks profe&s;&s;es him&s;elf an Enemy. But the <HI>Exami|ner</HI> takes upon him to be a <HI>Champion</HI> for the <HI>Church</HI>, and mu&s;t not allow &s;uch Sins to be ve|nial; yet at the &s;ame time he &s;hould have con&s;i|dered, that the other Party would recriminate, and have reflected, that there are too many of the <HI>Examiner</HI>'s <HI>Side</HI>, who do not behave them|&s;elves as if they were under <HI>Vows</HI> of <HI>Cha&s;tity</HI>. I know as <HI>&s;ly one</HI> among his great Friends, that loves a Wench as well as ever did old <HI>Rowley</HI>, (King <HI>Charles</HI> II.) Be&s;ides <HI>him</HI>, there is <HI>another</HI>, who finds Lei&s;ure from his weighty Affairs to &s;trole among the Stews, or, as &s;ome will have it, neglects his Writing now and then, to toy with the Bu&s;ine&s;s of a Nation. But this dull Fel|low, the <HI>Examiner</HI>, has &s;o little Sen&s;e of what the impartial World thinks of him and his Per|formance, that he gives him&s;elf an Air of Talking by way of good Humour. In the Beginning of the &s;ame Paper, <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Viz. <HI>The</HI> Examiner <HI>of</HI> Feb. 9<HI>th</HI>, 1712-13. <HI>abovementioned</HI>.</NOTE> the pretty Wanton is in a laughing Vein, and with a

<P>AMONG the many Apologies for the <HI>Stage</HI>, Mrs. <HI>Oldelfid</HI> always preferred that humorous one given by Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>, in his Di&s;cour&s;e upon Comedy, <HI>viz.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;POETRY alone, and chiefly the <HI>Drama</HI>, lies open to the In&s;ults of all Pretenders; &s;he was one of Nature's elde&s;t Offsprings, whence by her Birthright, and plain Simpli|city,
<PB N="50" REF="51">
&s;he pleads a genuine Likene&s;s to her Mother. Born in the Innocence of Time, &s;he provided not again&s;t the A&s;&s;aults of &s;uc|ceeding Ages; and, depending altogether on the generous End of her Invention, neg|lected tho&s;e &s;ecret Supports and &s;erpentine Devices u&s;ed by other Arts, that wind them&s;elves into Practice for more &s;ubtile and politick De&s;igns: <HI>Naked &s;he came into the World</HI>, and it is to be feared, like its Profe&s;|&endq;&s;ors, <HI>will go Naked out</HI>.</Q></P>
<P>I have often heard Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> mention the many agreeable Hours &s;he had &s;pent in Mr. <HI>Farquhar</HI>'s Company. The Original Parts &s;he had in his Plays, were only Two; <HI>Silvia</HI> in the <HI>Recruting Officer</HI>, and Mrs. <HI>Sullen</HI> in the <HI>Stra|tagem</HI>: Mo&s;t of his Comedies being written before Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s coming on the Stage; and in the Old Parts, as already ob&s;erved, &s;he &s;ucceeded Mrs. <HI>Verbruggen</HI>, who&s;e Maiden Name was <HI>Percival</HI>, and afterwards <HI>Mountfort</HI>.</P>
<P>Of this Gentlewoman, I am naturally led in|to the Relation of one melancholy Scene of her Life, in which I believe no Parallel can be found either in Ancient or Modern Hi&s;tory. Her Father Mr. <HI>Percival</HI> had the Misfortune to be drawn into the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination Plot again&s;t King <HI>William</HI>; for this he lay under Sentence of Death, which he received on the &s;ame Night that Lord <HI>Mohun</HI> killed her Husband Mr.
<PB N="51" REF="52">
<HI>Mountfort</HI>. Under this, almo&s;t in&s;uperable, Affliction, &s;he was introduced to the good Queen <HI>Mary</HI>, who being, as &s;he was plea&s;ed to &s;ay, <HI>&s;truck to the Heart</HI> upon receiving Mrs: <HI>Mount|fort</HI>'s Petition, immediately granted all that was in her Power, a Remi&s;&s;ion of her Father's Exe|cution for that of Tran&s;portation. But Fate had &s;o ordered it, that poor Mrs. <HI>Mountfort</HI> was to lo&s;e both Father and Husband. For as Mr. <HI>Percival</HI> was going abroad, he was &s;o weakened by his Impri&s;onment, that he was taken &s;ick on the Road, and died at <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI>.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Fatality</HI> which happens to the <HI>Shedders</HI> of <HI>Blood</HI>, I have alway remarked as a certain Effect of the Divine Vengance; and therefore all Gentlemen who are apt to draw their Swords upon the mo&s;t trivial Occa&s;ions, would do well to con&s;ider two or three Accidents I &s;hall here lay before them.</P>
<P N="1">1. That they would plea&s;e to remember Lord <HI>Mohun</HI>'s Cata&s;trophe; who, as Mr. <HI>Mountfort</HI> fell by his Hands, he fell in the Duel between him and Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI>, him&s;elf &s;ending the Challenge.</P>
<P N="2">2. At a Repre&s;entation of the <HI>Scornful La|dy</HI> &s;ome Years ago, for the Benefit of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, many Per&s;ons of Di&s;tinction were be|hind the Scenes. Among others Beau <HI>Fielding</HI> came, and being always mighty ambitious of &s;hewing his <HI>fine Make and Shape</HI>, as him&s;elf
<PB N="52" REF="53">
u&s;ed vainly to talk, he very clo&s;ely pre&s;&s;ed for|ward upon &s;ome Gentlemen, but in particular upon one Mr. <HI>Fulwood</HI>, a Barri&s;ter of <HI>Gray's-Inn</HI>, an Acquaintance of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>. Mr. <HI>Fulwood</HI> being a Gentleman of quick Re&s;ent|ment, told <HI>Fielding</HI> he u&s;ed him rudely; upon which, he laid his Hand upon his Sword, but Mr. <HI>Fulwood</HI> in&s;tantly drew and gave <HI>Fielding</HI> a Wound of twelve Inches deep in the Belly. This putting the Audience in|to the greate&s;t Con&s;ternation, <HI>Mr. Fulwood</HI> was with much Intreaty per&s;uaded to leave the Place. At length, out of Re&s;pect to Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> he did &s;o, and went to the Theatre in <HI>Lincoln's-Inn-Fields</HI>, where the &s;ame Eve|ning the <HI>Libertine</HI> was acted. Mr. <HI>Fulwood</HI> went into the Pit, and in a very few Minutes ca&s;t his Eye upon one Captain <HI>Cu&s;ack</HI>, to whom he had an old Grudge, and there demanded Satisfaction of him. Captain <HI>Cu&s;ack</HI> without the lea&s;t He&s;itation obeyed the Summons. They went into the Field, and in le&s;s than half an Hour, Word was brought into the Hou&s;e, that Mr. <HI>Fulwood</HI> was killed on the Spot, and Captain <HI>Cu&s;ack</HI> had made his E&s;ape.</P>
<P N="3">3. The la&s;t In&s;tance I &s;hall produce is in the Ca&s;e of the late Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Pine</HI>, of <HI>Ireland</HI>, who, when he was a Student of <HI>Lin|coln's-Inn</HI>, in tho&s;e Walks, killed the elde&s;t Son of one of the fine&s;t Gentleman in <HI>England</HI>. I
<PB N="53" REF="54">
beg to be excu&s;ed from naming, him becau&s;e he was my near Relation. However, the <HI>Weight</HI> of <HI>Blood</HI> hung &s;o heavy upon Mr. <HI>Pine</HI>, that he declared, he could not live in <HI>England</HI>, and went over to <HI>Ireland</HI>, in which Kingdom in|deed he made his Fortune; but an over-ruling Power dampt all his Joys, even to the Day of his Death, becau&s;e the Price of Blood was re|paid in his own Family, his elde&s;t Son being killed in a Duel in <HI>Ireland</HI>.</P>

<P>IT was under this Di&s;advantage that Doctor <HI>Kennet</HI> was called to preach a <HI>Funeral Ser|mon</HI> for the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>, from which he excu&s;ed him&s;elf, as a Stranger to that noble Family, and till then utterly unknown to them. But it appeared that a Reverend Prelate had re|commended him to that Duty, and had un|dertaken
<PB N="62" REF="63">
to give him &s;uch In&s;tructions, as might enable him to &s;peak with Truth and proper Ob&s;ervations of that Great Man. Upon this Encouragement, he complied with the im|portunate Reque&s;t, and upon a &s;hort Warning, amid&s;t the Nece&s;&s;ity of asking many Que&s;tions, and making many Vi&s;its, he drew up a &s;erious Sermon, and attended the very &s;olemn Funeral to <HI>Derby</HI>, delivering the Sermon before a very full Audience of the neighbouring Gentry, who could be&s;t judge of the Character given of that noble Peer; and in the &s;ame Evening, one of them at the Table, in the Name of the Re&s;t, thanked the Preacher, and told him that they, in that County, had been Witne&s;&s;es of the Truth of the mo&s;t material Things he had &s;o well &s;poken of the late Duke: And it was by their Report, and the concurrent Te&s;|timony of that Part of the Family that attend|ed tho&s;e Ob&s;equies, that his late Grace the Duke of <HI>Devon&s;hire</HI>, a Peer of great Prudence and Probity, generou&s;ly approved of that la&s;t Office and de&s;ired the Doctor to publi&s;h the Sermon; to which he &s;ubmitted with the le&s;s Fear of Of|fence, becau&s;e all he &s;aid relating to his Life was either &s;ugge&s;ted or allowed by the then Bi&s;hop of <HI>Sarum</HI>, who was intimately acquaint|ed with his Grace's Conduct; and all that he ob&s;erved concerning his Sickne&s;s and Death, was communicated to him by the Eye-Witne&s;s
<PB N="63" REF="64">
and faithful Judge of them, the then Lord Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Ely</HI>. Upon their Authority, and Appro|bation, the Doctor publi&s;hed his Sermon, and confirmed the main Subject of it, by ca&s;ting in &s;ome Hi&s;torical Collections relating to the De|&s;cent and Progre&s;s of that Noble Family; to which he made a mode&s;t Dedication to the late Duke; which he (who would have de&s;pi&s;|ed Flattery, and abhorred Fal&s;hood) was &s;o well plea&s;ed with, that he had a Re&s;pect and Favour for the Doctor, and &s;hewed it in a very kind Manner, by recommending him to the Queen for the Deanery of <HI>Peterborough</HI>, &s;oon after vacant by the Death of Dr. <HI>Freeman</HI>, which we may &s;uppo&s;e was the more ea&s;ily obtained of her Maje&s;ty, as being her Chaplain in Ordi|nary, by the Recommendation of the Lord Arch|bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Godolphin</HI>. This Preferment, tho' not &s;o much to be envied, rai&s;ed the fiercer Spite and Malice of the Party again&s;t him: Libels and peevi&s;h Sermons point|ed at him. They got young Men to tune the <HI>Oxford</HI> Pulpit, and let out their Univer&s;ity Pre&s;s to the Printing, or Reprinting a &s;orry Libel <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Hazard of a Death-Bed Repentance.</NOTE> of poor <HI>John Dunton</HI>'s again&s;t the decca&s;ed Duke and his Funeral Preacher. Some &s;aid that he had <HI>covered all the Vices</HI> of that great Man, which was &s;o far from being true, that he plain|ly intimated them. &mdash; "That this was the true Bottom of all the Clamour again&s;t Dean
<PB N="64" REF="65">
<HI>Kennet</HI>, both then and afterwards, is evident from the many violent Pamphlets and Libels pub|li&s;hed again&s;t him." And, it is meerly to &s;hew the Inveteracy of Prejudice on all Occa&s;ions, and of Party Malice in &s;ome, that the Reader has been troubled with this Digre&s;&s;ion; but, with candid Minds it will have its due Weight and U&s;e. For as to the Dean's palliating all the Duke's Vices, thereby in&s;inuating, that he was privy to his Grace's Amour with Mi&s;s <HI>Campion</HI>, and al&s;o that he was the Author of her Monumental In&s;cription;
<Q>&startq;The&s;e Ca|lumnies he was &s;o little concerned in, that he has often &s;aid, he had never before heard &endq;of them.</Q>

<Q>&startq;Per&s;ons who move in a Supe|rior Orb, will not be mewed up, nor be barred tho&s;e Plea&s;ures, which every Inferior &endq;Per&s;on thinks he has a Right to pur&s;ue.</Q>

<P>The Admirers of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> may ju&s;tly be &s;aid to be innumerable, as her Performance on the Stage was allowed to be inimitable.

The Gentleman who has lived with her &s;ince the Death of Mr. <HI>Maynwaring</HI> made it his &s;ole Bu&s;i|ne&s;s and Delight to place her in the &s;ame Rank of Reputation (to which her own natural Deportment greatly contributed,) with Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Condition; and the Mention &s;he has made of him, in her Will, &s;ufficiently confirms her ju&s;t Value for him.</P>
<P>Among the other <HI>Dramatical Memoirs</HI>, here|in recited, Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> having been mention|ed on Account of his mo&s;t excellent Writings; I think my &s;elf, in Ju&s;tice to <HI>his</HI> Memory (as well as to the <HI>Gentleman</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Capt.</HI> Shrimton.</NOTE> who married his Widow) to &s;et the Affair of his Marrying, <HI>ju&s;t at the Eve of his Death</HI>, (as Major <HI>Pack</HI> well expre&s;&s;es it) in a true Light.</P>

<Q>&startq;He had often told me, as I doubt not he did all his Acquaintance, that he would marry as &s;oon as his Life was de&s;paired of: Accord|ingly, a few Days before his Death he under|went the Ceremony; and joined together tho&s;e Two Sacraments, which wi&s;e Men &s;ay, &s;hould be the La&s;t we receive; for if you ob&s;erve, <HI>Matrimony</HI> is placed after <HI>Extream Unction</HI> in our <HI>Catechi&s;m</HI>, as a kind of Hint of the Order of Time in which they ought to be taken.

Some Hundred Pounds which he had with the Lady, di&s;charged tho&s;e Debts; a Jointure of 400 l. a Year mader Her a Recompence; and his Nephew he left to

comfort him&s;elf as well as he could, with the mi&s;erable Remains of a Mortgaged E&s;tate. I &s;aw our Friend twice after this was done, le&s;s peevi&s;h in his Sickne&s;s than he u&s;ed to be in his Health; neither much <HI>afraid</HI> of Dy|ing, nor (which in him had been more like|ly) much <HI>a&s;hamed</HI> of <HI>Marrying</HI>. The Eve|ning before he <HI>expired</HI>, he called his young Wife to the Bed-&s;ide, and earne&s;tly intreat|ed her not to deny him one Reque&s;t, the La&s;t he &s;hould make. Upon her A&s;&s;urance of Con&s;enting to it, he told her, <HI>My Dear, it is only this, that you will never marry an old Man again</HI>. I cannot help remarking, that <HI>Sickne&s;s</HI>, which often de&s;troys both <HI>Wit</HI> and <HI>Wi&s;dom</HI>, yet &s;eldom has Power to remove that Talent which we call <HI>Humour</HI>: Mr. <HI>Wycherley</HI> &s;hewed <HI>his</HI> even in this <HI>La&s;t Com|pliment</HI>; tho' I think his Reque&s;t a little hard, for <HI>why &s;hould he bar her from doubling her &endq;Jointure on the &s;ame ea&s;y Terms</HI>?</Q>

<P>We now come to the la&s;t Original Part of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield. James Thom&s;on</HI>, an ingeni|ous <HI>Scots</HI> Gentleman (Author of <HI>The Sea&s;ons</HI>) in the <HI>Preface</HI> to his Tragedy of <HI>Sophonisba</HI>, thus delivers him&s;elf:
<Q>&startq;I cannot conclude without owning my Obligations to tho&s;e concerned in the <HI>Repre&s;entation</HI>. They have indeed done me more than Ju&s;tice. What|ever was de&s;igned as amiable and engaging in <HI>Ma&s;&s;ini&s;&s;a</HI>, &s;hines out in Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>'s Ac|tion. Mrs. <HI>Olfideld</HI>, in the Character of <HI>So|phonisba</HI>, has excelled what, even in the Fond|ne&s;s of an Author, I could either wi&s;h or im|agine. The Grace, Dignity, and happy Variety of her Action, have been univer&s;ally &endq;applauded, and are truly admirable.</Q></P>
<P><HI>Sophonisba</HI> was the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Original Character in which She appeared on the Stage: But, the <HI>la&s;t</HI> Time of her Performance was on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 28th Day of <HI>April</HI>, 1730, when Sir <HI>John Vanbrugh</HI>'s excellent Comedy, The <HI>Provok'd Wife</HI>, was acted for the Benefit of Mr. <HI>Charke</HI>, wherein &s;he acted the Part of Lady <HI>Brute</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="75">I have been a&s;&s;ured by &s;ome of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s mo&s;t intimate Female-Friends, that &s;he had for &s;ome Years langui&s;hed under a very delcin|ing State of Health, tho' not from any Cau&s;e which Malice may &s;ugge&s;t. The natural Chear|fulne&s;s of her Temper made her ward off eve|ry Attack with the greate&s;t Alacrity. Yet, ma|ny times, when &s;he has been playing a Part, and received the univer&s;al Applau&s;e of an Au|dience, the Tears have fallen from her Cheeks with the Angui&s;h of Pain &s;he felt; &s;uch was her Willingne&s;s to oblige in her Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Upon the very Approach of her la&s;t Illne&s;s, &s;he mo&s;t earne&s;tly reque&s;ted her Phy&s;icians not to flatter her, but to give her their Opinions freely, <HI>what, they thought of her Ca&s;e</HI>. And when they told her, <HI>they feared the Fatality of it</HI>, &s;he replied, without the lea&s;t Shock, or Emotion, She <HI>acquie&s;ced in the Lot Providence had a&s;&s;igned her; and hoped &s;he &s;hould bear her Afflictions patiently</HI>.</P>
<P>Having this previous Notice of her Change, &s;he <HI>&s;et her Hou&s;e in Order</HI>, and made &s;uch an equitable Di&s;tribution of her E&s;tate, as is in eve|ry Re&s;pect highly commendable.</P>
<P>Her mo&s;t intimate and dear Friend, Mrs. <HI>Saunders</HI>, attended her almo&s;t from the Begin|ning to the End of her melancholy Six Months Langui&s;hment. This Gentlewoman was brought upon the Stage through the Recom|mendation of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, and in a mo&s;t a|greeable Manner entertained the Town for
<PB N="73" REF="76">
&s;ome Years, being e&s;teemed, <HI>in her Stile of Playing</HI>, one of the mo&s;t eminent Actre&s;&s;es. The Violence of an A&s;thmatical Indi&s;po&s;ition obliged her to leave the Stage. She retired to <HI>Watford</HI> in <HI>Hertford&s;hire</HI>, about fifteen Miles from <HI>London</HI>, where &s;he now lives, and from whence, upon my writing to her, &s;he has been plea&s;ed to favour me with the following Letter, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Received yours concerning Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>, who&s;e Memory, I hope, will never be forgotten by any that had the Plea&s;ure of being known to her.</P>
<P>The Account I can give of her Behaviour, during the Time of her Sickne&s;s, is but &s;hort, tho' &s;trictly true.</P>
<P>Her <HI>Funeral</HI> I never heard her once men|tion; but <HI>Chri&s;tian Fortitude</HI> &s;he had &s;ufficient; for tho' &s;he had no <HI>Prie&s;t</HI>, &s;he did the Office of one to the <HI>La&s;t</HI>.</P>
<P>When her <HI>Di&s;&s;olution drew nigh</HI>, and the <HI>Lamp of Life waxed dim</HI>, &s;he then expre&s;&s;ed her &s;elf in <HI>broken</HI> Words and <HI>pious</HI> Meditations, in the mo&s;t <HI>moving</HI> and <HI>&s;tronge&s;t</HI> Manner you can imagine.</P>
<P><PB N="74" REF="77">It may be ju&s;tly &s;aid &s;he <HI>prayed without cea&s;ing</HI>. She was all Goodne&s;s: The be&s;t of Daughters, the be&s;t of Mothers, and the be&s;t of Friends. Oh! that I had Words to &s;ound forth her Prai&s;e; but that, <HI>Sir</HI>, is a Task you have taken in hand, and I do not doubt your doing Ju&s;tice to her Memory.</P>
<P>As to my own Time on the Stage, to the be&s;t of my Remembrance, I came into the Hou&s;e in the Year 1702; and my ill State of Health obliged me to quit it in 1720.</P>
<P>A Copy of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s Picture is at your Service, and I &s;hall gladly accept of that ex|cellent Copy you are about to draw of her; it will give va&s;t Plea&s;ure to,</P>

<P>Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> was at length relea&s;ed from her Earthly Bonds, expiring very early on <HI>Friday</HI> Morning, <HI>October</HI> 23. 1730.</P>
<P>As the Nicety of Dre&s;s was her Delight when living, &s;he was as nicely dre&s;&s;ed after her De|cea&s;e; being by Mrs. <HI>Saunders</HI>'s Direction thus laid in her Coffin. She had on a very fine <HI>Bru&s;&s;els</HI> Lace Head; a Holland Shift with a Tucker, and double Ruffles of the &s;ame Lace; a Pair of New Kid-Gloves, and her Body wrapped up in a Winding Sheet.</P>
<P><PB N="75" REF="78">On her Coffin, was this In&s;cription:
<Q>ANNE OLDFIELD, Aetatis 47.</Q></P>
<P>On <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 27th of <HI>October</HI>, the Corps was carried from her Hou&s;e, in <HI>Gro&s;venor-Street</HI>, to the <HI>Jeru&s;alem-Chamber We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>, where it lay in State, and about Eleven o' Clock was conveyed to the Abbey: The Pall being &s;upported by the Lord <HI>Delawar</HI>, Lord <HI>Harvey</HI>, the Right Honourable <HI>George Bubb Doddington, Charles Hedges</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> <HI>Walter Carey</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> and Capt <HI>Elliot</HI>.</P>
<P>Her elde&s;t Son, <HI>Arthur Maynwaring</HI>, <ABBR>E&s;q</ABBR> was Chief Mourner. The Funeral Service was performed by the Reverend Dr. <HI>Barker</HI>, Senior Prebendary, then Re&s;ident.</P>
<P>Here I think my &s;elf obliged to expo&s;e the In&s;olence of that Weekly Libeller, the <HI>Grub|&s;treet</HI> Journali&s;t.</P>

This wretched Sneer can only af|fect the Writer of it; and I wi&s;h when he comes

to die, that a Te&s;timony as ample, and &s;incere, of his <HI>Chri&s;tian Virtues</HI>, may be produced, as Mrs. <HI>Saunders</HI> has given of Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI>'s; and as for her <HI>Moral Virtues</HI>, her <HI>La&s;t Will and Te&s;tament</HI> is a Demon&s;tration of her Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Some Folks, it &s;eems, much more <HI>&s;crupulous</HI> than <HI>con&s;cientious</HI>, would have laid hold on an ob&s;olete <HI>Popi&s;h</HI> Canon; which ordains, that <HI>no</HI> Stage Players <HI>&s;hould be buried in Churches</HI>. But I have been a&s;&s;ured by Dr. <HI>Barker</HI> him&s;elf that he buried Mrs. <HI>Oldfield</HI> very willingly, and with the greate&s;t Satisfaction.</P>
<P>The Place of her Interment is towards the <HI>We&s;t</HI> End of the <HI>South</HI> I&s;le, (near the Monu|ment of Secretary <HI>Craggs</HI> and Mr. <HI>Congreve</HI>) hard by the <HI>Con&s;i&s;tory</HI>, or Spiritual-Court.</P>
<P>Taking Occa&s;ion, from the&s;e <HI>Three</HI> eminent Per&s;ons having never been <HI>married</HI>, a certain Gentleman, well known at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI>, was very innocently witty; and threw down the&s;e Ver&s;es, written with a Pencil, upon Mrs. <HI>Old|field</HI>'s Grave, after the Ceremony was over, <HI>viz.</HI></P>

<Q>&startq;&s;uch infamous Reports ari&s;e, from her be|ing more lovely than the re&s;t of <HI>her Sex</HI>, &s;he was envied by &s;uch malicious Wretches; but all who knew her will confirm this Truth, that, &s;he was never guilty of any &endq;ba&s;e or ungenerous Action.</Q></P>
