<HEAD>AN ESSAY ON THE ART OF ACTING.</HEAD>
<P>THE fir&s;t dramatic principle (and it mu&s;t always be uppermo&s;t in a good actor's me|mory, if he hopes to reach perfection in his bu&s;ine&s;s) is the following:</P>
<P>To act a pa&s;&s;ion well, the actor never mu&s;t attempt its imitation, till his fancy has conceived &s;o &s;trong an image, or idea, of it, as to move the &s;ame im|pre&s;&s;ive &s;prings within his mind, which form that pa&s;&s;ion when it is unde&s;igned and natural.</P>
<P>This is an ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, and the only general rule. And let no actor ap|prehend it over difficult. The <HI>practice</HI> of
<PB N="10" REF="8">
it &s;hall be laid down clearly; and it will be found extremely ea&s;y and delightful, both in &s;tudy and execution. And the truth of its <HI>foundation</HI>, that it is wholly built on nature, is evident beyond di&s;|pute, upon examining its effects, in this deduction, from their cau&s;es.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t</HI>, The imagination mu&s;t conceive a <HI>&s;trong idea</HI> of the pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly</HI>, But that idea cannot <HI>&s;trongly</HI> be conceived, without impre&s;&s;ing its own form upon the mu&s;cles of the <HI>face</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly</HI>, Nor <HI>can</HI> the look be mu&s;cularly &s;tamped, without communicating, in&s;tant|ly, the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ions to the mu&s;cles of the <HI>body</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly</HI>, The mu&s;cles of the body (braced or &s;lack, as the idea was an active or pa&s;&s;ive $ne), mu&s;t, in their natural, and not-to-be-avoided con&s;equence, by impelling or $etarding the flow of the animal &s;pirits, $ran&s;mit their own conceived &s;en&s;ation to he &s;ound of the <HI>voice</HI>, and di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>ge&s;ture</HI>.</P>
<P>And this is a &s;hort ab&s;tract of the art, in its mo&s;t comprehen&s;ive and reduced idea.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="9">But there mu&s;t follow <HI>applications</HI> of the general rule, by particular references, for the practical u&s;e of the actor.</P>
<P>And, fir&s;t, it &s;hould be noted, that there are only <HI>ten</HI> dramatic pa&s;&s;ions; that is, pa&s;&s;ions which can be di&s;tingui&s;hed by their outward marks, in action; all others being relative to, and but varied degrees of, the foregoing.</P>
<P>The&s;e are the ten dramatic pa&s;&s;ions:
<Q>JOY, GRIEF, FEAR, ANGER, PITY, SCORN, HATRED, JEALOUSY, WONDER, LOVE.</Q></P>
<P>And now, for application of the rule to each of the&s;e in its particular di&s;tinction; <HI>in which an actor will be fully prepared for the expre&s;&s;ion of either, or all, of the above pa&s;&s;ions</HI>.</P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION I. Of JOY. DEFINITION. <HI>JOY is Pride, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of Triumph.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is a warm and con&s;cious expan&s;ion of the heart, indulging a &s;en&s;e of pre&s;ent
<PB N="12" REF="10">
plea&s;ure, and comparing it with pa&s;t af|fliction: It cannot, therefore, be expre&s;&s;ed without vivacity in look, air, and accent.</P>
<P>But it will be proper, for di&s;tingui&s;hing the modes of repre&s;enting this, and every other pa&s;&s;ion, to con&s;ider their effect on &s;peeches, wherein that particular pa&s;&s;ion governs, which is about to be attempted by the &s;peaker.</P>
<P>And, for ever, let it be the fir&s;t and chief care of an actor who a&s;pires to &s;hine in his profe&s;&s;ion, to di&s;cover where, in all his characters, the author has intended any change of pa&s;&s;ions. For, unle&s;s the pa&s;&s;ion is fir&s;t known, how is it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould be painted?</P>
<P><HI>Joy</HI>, for in&s;tance, is the pa&s;&s;ion, in the fol|lowing tran&s;port of <HI>Torri&s;mond</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>&mdash;"Oh heaven! &s;he pities me.</L>
<L>"And pity, &s;till, fore-runs approaching love;</L>
<L>"As lightning does the thunder.&mdash;Tune your harps,</L>
<L>"Ye angels! to that &s;ound: and thou, my heart!</L>
<L>"Make room&mdash;to entertain the flowing joy!</L></Q>
<P>When the actor has di&s;covered, that the pa&s;&s;ion in this place is <HI>joy</HI>, he mu&s;t not, upon any account, attempt the utterance of one &s;ingle word, till he has fir&s;t com|pelled
<PB N="13" REF="11">
his fancy to conceive an idea of joy. And it would be his natural, though mo&s;t difficult way, to endeavour the effacement of all note, or image of him&s;elf, and for|cibly bind down his fancy to &s;uppo&s;e, that he is, really, <HI>Torri&s;mond</HI>&mdash;that he is in love with <HI>Leonora</HI>, and has been ble&s;&s;ed, be|yond his hope, by her kind declaration in his favor.</P>
<P>But there is a &s;horter road to the &s;ame end, and it &s;hall, in due place, be &s;hewn him. When he believes him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch an idea of joy, that would not fail to warm a &s;trong conception; let him not imagine the impre&s;&s;ion rightly hit, till he has ex|amined both his face and air, in a long, upright, looking gla&s;s; for <HI>there</HI>, only, will he meet with a &s;incere and undeceiv|able te&s;t of his having &s;trongly enough, or too &s;lackly, adapted his fancy to the pur|po&s;e before him.</P>
<P>If, for example, his brow, in the gla&s;s, appears bent, or cloudy, his neck bowing, and relaxed, his brea&s;t not thrown grace|fully back, and elate; if he &s;ees his arm &s;wing languid, or hang motionle&s;s, his
<PB N="14" REF="12">
back-bone repo&s;ed, or un&s;traitened, and the joints of his hip, knee, and ancle, not &s;trong|braced, by &s;welling out the &s;inews to their full extent. All, or any of the&s;e &s;piritle&s;s &s;igns, in the gla&s;s, may convince him, that he has too faintly conceived the impre&s;&s;ion: and, at once, to <HI>prove</HI> it, to his own full &s;atisfaction, let him, at that time, endea|vour to &s;peak out, with a voice as high rai&s;ed as he plea&s;es, he will find, that, in that languid &s;tate of mu&s;cles, he can never bring it to &s;ound <HI>joy:</HI> no, not though the &s;en&s;e of the words were all rapture; but, in &s;pite of the utmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible &s;train upon his lungs, his tone will be too &s;ullen, or too mournful, and carry none of the mu&s;ic of &s;prightline&s;s. But if, on the contrary, he has hit the conception exactly, he will have the plea&s;ure, in that ca&s;e, to ob&s;erve, in the gla&s;s, that his forehead appears open, and rai&s;ed, his eye &s;miling, and &s;parkling, his neck will be &s;tretched and erect, without &s;tiffne&s;s, as if it would add new height to his &s;tature; his brea&s;t will be inflated, and maje&s;tically backened; his back-bone erect, and all the joints of
<PB N="15" REF="13">
his arm, wri&s;t, fingers, hip, knee, and ancle, will be high-&s;trung and braced boldly. And <HI>now</HI>, if he attempts to &s;peak <HI>joy</HI>, all the &s;pirit of the pa&s;&s;ion will a&s;|cend in his accents, and the very tone of his voice will &s;eem to out-rapture the meaning.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>rea&s;on</HI> of all this, it is as clear as the con&s;equence. For the&s;e are nature's own marks and impre&s;&s;ions on the body, in ca&s;es where the pa&s;&s;ion is produced by involuntary emotions.&mdash;And, when natural impre&s;&s;ions are imitated exactly by art, the effect of &s;uch art mu&s;t &s;eem natural.</P>
<P>But, becau&s;e difficulties would ari&s;e, in the practice of &s;o &s;trong a conception, before fancy is become ductile enough to a&s;&s;ume &s;uch impre&s;&s;ions at will (as in the in&s;tance of <HI>joy</HI>, now before us), the actor, taking the <HI>&s;horter road</HI>, above promi&s;ed him, may help his defective idea, in a moment, by annexing at once, the <HI>look</HI> to the <HI>idea</HI>, in the very in&s;tant, while he is bracing his nerves into &s;pringine&s;s: for &s;o, the image, the look, and the mu&s;cles, all concurring <HI>at once</HI>, to the purpo&s;e, their effect will be
<PB N="16" REF="14">
the &s;ame, as if each had &s;ucceeded another progre&s;&s;ively.</P>
<P>To convince him&s;elf of the natural truth of the&s;e principles, he has nothing to do but, fir&s;t, to &s;peak the foregoing example of <HI>joy</HI>, with his look grave, or idle, and his nerves ea&s;ed or languid; and immedi|ately afterwards repeat the &s;ame &s;peech, with a &s;mile of delight in his eye, with his joints all high-braced, and his &s;inews ex|tended&mdash;his own ear will become his ac|knowledged in&s;tructor.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION II. Of GRIEF. DEFINITION. GRIEF is Di&s;appointment, void of Hope.</HEAD>
<P>IT is a mournful and un&s;truggling re&s;ig|nation of defence, to apprehen&s;ion of ca|lamity: and therefore mu&s;t require, to expre&s;s it rightly, a &s;ad look, carele&s;s air, and voice unrai&s;ed, and indolent.</P>
<P>For a &s;peech, wherein this melancholy rever&s;e of the foregoing pa&s;&s;ion is expre&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="17" REF="15">
to the wi&s;h of an actor, we may borrow a &s;econd time from the &s;ame <HI>Torri&s;mond</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"But, I have been in &s;uch a di&s;mal place!</L>
<L>"Where joy ne'er enters, which the &s;un ne'er cheers,</L>
<L>"Bound in with darkne&s;s, over&s;pread with damps,</L>
<L>"Where I have &s;een&mdash;if I could &s;ay, I &s;aw&mdash;</L>
<L>"The good old king&mdash;maje&s;tic, ev'n in bands!</L>
<L>"And, 'mid&s;t his griefs, mo&s;t venerably great!</L>
<L>"By a dim, winking lamp, that feebly broke</L>
<L>"The gloomy vapors, he lay, &s;tretch'd along,</L>
<L>"Upon th' unwhol&s;ome ground, his eyes ca&s;t low;</L>
<L>"And, ever and anon, a &s;ilent tear</L>
<L>"Stole down, and trickled from his aged cheek."</L></Q>
<P>A &s;peaker, who would di&s;tre&s;s his imagi|nation into a complete a&s;&s;umption of the &s;orrow expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e lines, will fir&s;t con&s;ider, that <HI>grief</HI> being a pa&s;&s;ion the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite in nature to joy, his look, that was before enlivened, mu&s;t, now, in a moment, take a mournful and declined impre&s;&s;ion. His mu&s;cles mu&s;t fall loo&s;e, and be unbraced into the habit of languor. And, then, no &s;ooner &s;hall his nerves have formed them&s;elves to this lax di&s;po&s;ition, for complying with the melancholy de|mand of the &s;entiments, than his voice al&s;o will a&s;&s;ociate its &s;ound to the plaintive re|&s;ignation of his ge&s;ture, and the re&s;ult, both
<PB N="18" REF="16">
in air and accent, will be the mo&s;t moving re&s;emblance of a heart-felt and pa&s;&s;ionate &s;orrow. Whereas, let him endeavour with all po&s;&s;ible indu&s;try, &s;o to &s;adden his voice, without a previous accommodation of his look, and his &s;inews, to the faintne&s;s of the image intended, his tone will be hard, au&s;tere, and unfeeling&mdash;and more and more remote from the true &s;ound of di&s;tre&s;s, in exact proportion to the &s;pring he had re|tained on his nerves, and the vigor that had over-animated his eye, or too ardently quickened his ge&s;ture.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>APPLICATION III. Of FEAR. DEFINITION. FEAR is Grief, di&s;cerning and avoiding Danger.</HEAD>
<P>IT is an apprehen&s;ive, but un&s;inewed &s;truggle, betwixt caution and de&s;pair: It cannot therefore be expre&s;&s;ed but by a look alarmed and watchful, with a voice and air unanimated.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="17">Take, for example of this pa&s;&s;ion, the fol|lowing &s;hort &s;peech, from <HI>Clarence</HI>, in Shake&s;pear's <HI>Richard the Third</HI>.</P>
<Q><L>"O! I have pa&s;s'd a mi&s;erable night!</L>
<L>"So full of fearful dreams! of ugly &s;ights!</L>
<L>"That, as I am a chri&s;tian faithful man,</L>
<L>"I would not &s;pend another &s;uch a night,</L>
<L>"Tho' 'twere to buy a world of happy days!</L>
<L>"So full of di&s;mal terror was the time!"</L></Q>
<P>Here, an actor, who would impre&s;s his imagination with a natural idea of fear, will mo&s;t effectually repre&s;ent it, by a&s;|&s;uming the &s;ame languor, in look and in mu&s;cles, that was ju&s;t now de&s;cribed, as peculiar to <HI>grief</HI>. For then, if he would &s;trike out, in an in&s;tant, the di&s;tinction by which fear is diver&s;ified from &s;orrow, let him only, in place of that re&s;igned, plain|tive, pa&s;&s;ive di&s;tre&s;s, that is proper to <HI>grief</HI>, add (without altering the relax'd &s;tate of his nerves) a &s;tarting, apprehen&s;ive and li&s;tening alarm to his look, keeping his eyes widely &s;tretched, but unfixed; his mouth &s;till, and open; his &s;teps light and &s;hifting,&mdash;yet, his joints unbraced, faint, nervele&s;s. And, then will his whole air
<PB N="20" REF="18">
expre&s;s the true picture of Fear, and his voice, too, <HI>&s;ound</HI> it &s;ignificantly.</P>

<P>IT is expanded &s;oftne&s;s, in the heart; in|dulged attachment, in the fancy; and an awe (from fear to be di&s;ta&s;teful where we wi&s;h to plea&s;e), upon the &s;pirits. It can never, therefore, rightly be expre&s;&s;ed, with|out a look of apprehen&s;ive tenderne&s;s, that &s;oftens a high-braced and animated air, and ca&s;ts a mode&s;t cloud of diffidence over too quick a &s;en&s;e of tran&s;port. And thus we are come, at la&s;t, to a pa&s;&s;ion, the true
<PB N="39" REF="37">
name whereof might be <HI>Legion</HI>; for it in|cludes all the other, in all their degrees and varieties. It has therefore been po&s;t|poned, and kept to bring up the rear; tho' from the weight and extent of its influence, it ought to have taken place in the front of the number.</P>
<P>There is, however, independent of its au|xiliary and occa&s;ional pa&s;&s;ions, a di&s;tinct air, ge&s;ture, look, and manner of &s;peaking, peculiar to Love, in its &s;erene and unruf|fled impre&s;&s;ivene&s;s. And becau&s;e there are not many actors, in whom nature has done all that appears nece&s;&s;ary, for expre&s;&s;ing the genteelne&s;s and the &s;oftne&s;s, together with the freedom and the fire, which unite their contraries, of &s;etting off the &s;pirit of this pa&s;&s;ion, it is nece&s;&s;ary to reflect a little on the rea&s;on, why it is common to &s;ee Love unfeelingly, affectedly, and even ridicu|lou&s;ly acted in our theatres.</P>
<P>The lazy cau&s;e is, want of <HI>tenderne&s;s</HI>, or at lea&s;t of <HI>application</HI>, to conceive the true idea. For this pa&s;&s;ion, more than any other, lends a tongue to every look, and &s;heds an eloquence on every motion. It cannot
<PB N="40" REF="38" MS="Y">
bear, then, a cold, formal emptine&s;s; a big, broad, mellow troll of &s;mooth, unani|mated wordine&s;s. It a&s;ks for <HI>&s;oul</HI>, in thought, air, movement. It exacts &s;uch &s;trict confederacy between the heart, the mien, the eye, and tongue, that it di&s;|dains to pardon a bold, voluble, and lec|ture-like (however mu&s;ical and &s;ounding) in&s;ignificancy.</P>
<P>The idea then to be conceived by one, who would expre&s;s Love elegantly, is that of Joy, combined with Fear.</P>
<P>It is a con&s;cious and triumphant &s;well of <HI>hope</HI>, intimidated by re&s;pectful apprehen&s;ion of offending, where we long to &s;eem agree|able. It is the exhalation of a &s;oft de&s;ire, which, to the warmth in&s;pired by wi&s;hes, joins the mode&s;ty of a &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive doubt|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>It is complaint, made amiable by graceful|ne&s;s; reproach, endeared by tenderne&s;s; and rapture, awed by reverence.</P>
<P>Without a previous fixed idea of the pa&s;|&s;ion, in this native light, the fine&s;t of all human voices would in vain attempt to touch it tenderly. And this might be im|mediately
<PB N="41" REF="39" MS="Y">

<P>Here, if the nerves are braced, with proper warmth, to the high pitch of Joy, and the inclining <HI>look</HI> divided, gracefully, betwixt a tender <HI>fear</HI>, and a triumphant <HI>plea&s;ure</HI>, every accent will confe&s;s the pa&s;&s;ion, in a &s;oft, impre&s;&s;ive touchingne&s;s. Whereas, without &s;uch previous di&s;po&s;ition for at|taining the <HI>idea</HI>, the vague, undirected tone, would &s;ometimes &s;ound too faint, &s;ometimes too har&s;h; and always in&s;incere, declama|tory, and un&s;triking.</P>

<HEAD>QUESTIONS and ANSWERS Demon&s;trating the natural Cau&s;es of the Me|chani&s;m in the Rules foregoing.</HEAD>
<P><HI>QUESTION</HI> I. Why is Joy expre&s;&s;ed by mu&s;cles inten&s;e, and a &s;mile in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Joy is pride po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of triumph. Pride and triumph give inflated ideas, and high-rai&s;ed and bold conceptions.&mdash; But the mu&s;cles mu&s;t-be inten&s;e when they expre&s;s elevation; becau&s;e relaxed nerves are peculiar to depre&s;&s;ed conception.
<PB N="49" REF="47">
And the eye mu&s;t be &s;miling, before it can paint &s;atisfac|tion: becau&s;e a frown would imply di&s;content; and to con|ceive Joy, with di&s;plea&s;ure, is a fal&s;e, becau&s;e, an unnatural <HI>impre&s;&s;ion</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> II. Why is Anger expre&s;&s;ed with mu&s;cles inten&s;e, and a frown in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Anger is pride provoked beyond regard of caution&mdash; Uncautious pride exults in menaces and arrogance.&mdash;But, neither arrogance nor menaces can con&s;i&s;t with relaxation of the nerves; becau&s;e, &s;lack mu&s;cles, are a con&s;equence of weak and faint, not boa&s;tful and avowed ideas. The eye, too, in this pa&s;&s;ion, is over-clouded by a frown; becau&s;e, it catches &s;en&s;e of indignation, from vindictive and di&s;ta&s;teful images; and not to &s;how that outward mark of the mind, agitation, inwardly, would be a&s;&s;uming a DISGUISE, to cover &s;en&s;ibility;&mdash;a prudence, never natural in anger; becau&s;e, its great characteri&s;tic property, is ra&s;h and open in&s;ult.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> III. Why is Pity expre&s;&s;ed by mu&s;cles inten&s;e, and a &s;adne&s;s in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Pity is active grief, for another's afflictions. But we can never &s;incerely <HI>mourn</HI> di&s;tre&s;&s;es when we do not feel them touchingly.&mdash;Whatever we &s;o feel, we <HI>look</HI>&mdash;by natural in|clination, and nece&s;&s;ity. No vi&s;age, but a <HI>&s;ad</HI> one, therefore, can con&s;i&s;t with the di&s;tre&s;s of pity.&mdash;But the mu&s;cles, to ex|pre&s;s this pa&s;&s;ion, mu&s;t be braced; becau&s;e, whatever we pity, we inten&s;ely wi&s;h to give relief to; and, &s;ince the will, when active, compels active fibres; it remains a natural con&s;equence, that this &s;eeming contrariety between the ge&s;|ture and the look, is the true medium to expre&s;s compa&s;&s;ion; for being nature's own effect, when &s;he impre&s;&s;es marks of pity, in her u&s;ual manner; art, a&s;&s;uming the &s;ame out|ward &s;prings to work by, cannot fail to repre&s;ent <HI>her, with exactne&s;s</HI>.</P>
<P><PB N="50" REF="48" MS="Y"><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> IV. Why is Hatred expre&s;&s;ed by mu&s;cles inten&s;e, and aver&s;ion in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Hatred is re&s;trained, yet la&s;ting anger. Anger in|flames the will, and as the will, becoming active, actuates the <HI>mu&s;cles</HI>, they mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be &s;trained hard; and prompt to violent exertion, when they would expre&s;s this pa&s;&s;ion properly. But then, as it is anger not thrown out, but patient, covered, and re&s;trained; the <HI>eye</HI> withdraws it|&s;elf from a di&s;ta&s;teful object, to imply <HI>aver&s;ion</HI> in re&s;traint of fury. And herein con&s;i&s;ts the natural di&s;tinction that paints Hatred, on the <HI>outward</HI> lineaments.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> V. Why is Wonder expre&s;&s;ed by mu&s;cles inten&s;e, and an awful <HI>alarm</HI> in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Wonder is inqui&s;itive fear. As it is inqui&s;itive, it is &s;tedfa&s;t, and demands firm mu&s;cles. &mdash;But as it is fear, it cannot ju&s;tly be expre&s;&s;ed, without the marks of appre|hen&s;ion, and alarm&mdash;Were this alarm a too-di&s;turbed one, full of motion and anxiety; it would paint Fear, in&s;tead of Wonder; and would carry no con&s;i&s;tence with braced mu&s;cles. It is, therefore, firmly nerved, becau&s;e inqui|&s;itive with purpo&s;e of defence: And &s;o, this application of <HI>alarm</HI>, with re&s;olution to examine &s;tedfa&s;tly, mu&s;t con&s;titute a nervous, awful, fixed attentivene&s;s; and give the picture of the pa&s;&s;ion naturally.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> VI. Why is Love expre&s;&s;ed by mu&s;cles inten&s;e, and a re&s;pectful <HI>attachment</HI> in the eye?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Love is de&s;ire kept temperate by reverence&mdash;De&s;ire mu&s;t be attached; and as, in love, its object is a vi&s;ible one, de&s;ire of objects vi&s;ible mu&s;t &s;hew it&s;elf, mo&s;t plainly, in the eye.&mdash;But then, our fear to give di&s;ta&s;te, attempering de&s;ire with <HI>reverence</HI>, creates re&s;pectful &s;oftne&s;s in the look and attitude. And this external &s;oftne&s;s being &s;trengthened, by

an inward brace upon the nerves (the natural con&s;equence of hope and joy), enlivening reverence by effu&s;ion of a &s;park|ling plea&s;ure, there is tran&s;mitted to the eye, the ear, and heart, of an attentive audience, the &s;ame impre&s;&s;ion, which the actor's &s;pirits are impelled by.</P>

<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Grief is di&s;appointment void of hope. But mu&s;cles braced inten&s;e imply hope &s;trongly; and a &s;pirited vivacity in the eye is the effect of plea&s;ure and elevation.&mdash;The&s;e are naturally con&s;i&s;tent with a pa&s;&s;age that <HI>depre&s;&s;es</HI>, which grief manife&s;tly does: Becau&s;e, depre&s;&s;ion &s;lackens all the nerves, nerves unbraced deject the look, and air, in nece&s;&s;ary con|&s;equence; and, therefore, a relaxed mien, and languid eye, mu&s;t form the <HI>true&s;t picture</HI> of a <HI>natural &s;orrow</HI>.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> VIII. Why is Fear expre&s;&s;ed by languid look and mu&s;cles, with <HI>alarm</HI> in eye and motion?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Fear is grief di&s;cerning and avoiding danger.&mdash;As it is grief, it mu&s;t depre&s;s the &s;pirits, and unbrace the mu&s;cles; whence the languid air becomes adapted and characteri&s;tic.&mdash; But, as it is a grief, not carele&s;s and re&s;igned, but appre|hen&s;ive, fugitive and &s;tarting, it demands a lightne&s;s in the motion, with a watchful, though unanimated &s;harpne&s;s in the eye; becau&s;e, the fancy has conceived idea of threatening mi&s;chief; but the object, overcharging the imagination, has relaxed the unconcurring fibres into a debility, unable to obey the will, which, therefore, but <HI>evades</HI>, and not <HI>re&s;i&s;ts</HI> the danger.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> IX. Why is Scorn expre&s;&s;ed by languid mu&s;cles; with a <HI>&s;mile</HI> upon the eye in the light &s;pecies, or a <HI>frown</HI> to hit the &s;erious.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="50" MS="Y"><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Scorn is negligent anger. It in&s;inuates, therefore, by a voluntary &s;lackne&s;s, or di&s;arming of the nerves, a known, or a concluded ab&s;ence of all power in the in&s;ulted object, even to make defence &s;eem nece&s;&s;ary.&mdash;And the unbraced mu&s;cles are a&s;&s;i&s;ted in this &s;how of contemptuous di&s;regard, by an affected &s;mile upon the eye; becau&s;e &s;lack nerves, if, at the &s;ame time, the look were al&s;o languid, would too much re&s;emble <HI>&s;orrow</HI>, or even <HI>fear</HI>; whereas, the purpo&s;e is di&s;dain and in&s;ult&mdash;And though in more provoking, <HI>&s;erious</HI> ca&s;es, where the &s;corn admits di&s;turbance, it a&s;&s;umes &s;ome &s;en&s;e of <HI>anger</HI>; it mu&s;t, &s;till, retain the &s;lack, unguarded languor on the nerves, le&s;t it &s;hould &s;eem to have conceived impre&s;&s;ions of &s;ome e&s;timable, or important weightine&s;s, where its <HI>de&s;ign</HI> is <HI>utter</HI> di&s;regard and negligence.</P>
<P><HI>Que&s;t.</HI> X. Why is Jealou&s;y expre&s;&s;ed by mu&s;cles inten&s;e, and the look pen&s;ive&mdash;or by the look inten&s;e, and <HI>mu&s;cles languid</HI>, interchangeably?</P>
<P><HI>An&s;w.</HI> Jealou&s;y is doubtful anger &s;truggling again&s;t faith and pity&mdash;It is a tenderne&s;s re&s;i&s;ted by re&s;entment of &s;u&s;pected in|jury; and thence, the <HI>nerves</HI>, braced &s;trong, imply deter|mination of revenge and puni&s;hment.&mdash;While, at the &s;ame time, a &s;oft, pen&s;ive he&s;itation in the eye, confe&s;&s;es a reluc|tance at the heart to part with, or efface, a gentle and in|dulged idea.</P>
<P>Sometimes again, it is rage at a concluded infidelity&mdash;And then the eye receives, and fla&s;hes out the &s;parklings of in|flamed ideas; while the mu&s;cles, counteracting the will's violence, from a repre&s;&s;ive di&s;po&s;ition of the heart, grow &s;lack, and lo&s;e their &s;pring; and &s;o di&s;arm, or mollify, en|raged imagination.</P>
<P>And from this un&s;ettled wavering in the ballance of the pur|po&s;e, where the heart and judgment weigh each other, and both &s;cales, by turns, preponderate, is deduced a <HI>glowing</HI> picture of this pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="53" REF="51" MS="Y">I have travelled, now, through ten pa|thetic &s;tages, where an actor mu&s;t not &s;top for re&s;t, as in his other journies, but for labor; and &s;uch a labor will be truly find it (if he enters naturally into the demand of tho&s;e &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions), that neither mind nor body can be capable of chu&s;ing a more healthfully-fatiguing exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>And this remark brings into my remem|brance, a great and general mi&s;take among the players, at <HI>rehear&s;al</HI>, where it is their common practice to mutter over their parts inwardly, and keep <HI>in</HI> their voices, with a mis-imagined purpo&s;e of pre&s;erving them again&s;t their evening <HI>acting</HI>&mdash;Whereas, the &s;ure&s;t, natural means of &s;trengthening their delivery, would be, to warm, de|phlegm, and clarify the thorax and wind|pipe, by exerting (the more frequently the better) their fulle&s;t power of utterance; thereby to open and remove all he&s;itation, roughne&s;s, or ob&s;truction, and to tune their voices, by effect of &s;uch continual ex|erci&s;e, into habitual mellowne&s;s, and ea&s;e of compa&s;s and inflexion; ju&s;t from the &s;ame rea&s;on, that an active body is more &s;trong and healthy, than a &s;edentary one.</P>
