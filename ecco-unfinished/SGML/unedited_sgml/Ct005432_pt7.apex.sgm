<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Publi&s;her of the Surreptitious Edition, 1735.</HEAD>
<P>WE pre&s;ume we want no apology to the reader for this publication, but &s;ome may be thought needful to Mr. Pope: however he cannot think our offence &s;o great as theirs, who fir&s;t &s;eparately publi&s;hed what we have here but collected in a better form and order. As for the letters we have procured to be added, they &s;erve but to complete, explain, and &s;ometimes &s;et in a true light, tho&s;e others, which it was not in the writer's, or our power to recall.</P>
<P>This collection hath been owing to &s;everal cabi|nets: &s;ome drawn from thence by accidents, and others (even of tho&s;e to ladies) voluntarily given. It is to one of that &s;ex we are beholden for the whole corre&s;pondence with H. C. e&s;q. which let|ters being lent her by that gentleman, &s;he took the liberty to print; as appears by the following,

which we &s;hall give at length, both as it is &s;ome|thing curious, and as it may &s;erve for an apo|logy for our&s;elves.</P>

<P>AFTER &s;o long a &s;ilence as the many and great oppre&s;&s;ions I have &s;ighed un|der have occa&s;ioned, one is at a lo&s;s how to begin a letter to &s;o kind a friend as your&s;elf. But as it was always my re&s;olution, if I mu&s;t &s;ink, to do it as decently (that is, as &s;ilently) as I could; &s;o when I found my&s;elf plunged into unfore&s;een, and unavoidable ruin, I retreated from the world, and in a manner buried my|&s;elf in a di&s;mal place, where I knew none, and none knew me. In this dull unthinking way, I have protracted a lingring death (for life it cannot be called) ever &s;ince you &s;aw me, &s;e|que&s;tered from company, deprived of my books, and nothing left to conver&s;e with, but the letters of my dead or ab&s;ent friends; among which latter I always placed yours, and Mr. Pope's in the fir&s;t rank. I lent &s;ome of them indeed to an ingenious per&s;on, who was &s;o de|lighted with the &s;pecimen, that he importuned me for a &s;ight of the re&s;t, which having ob|tained,
<PB N="iii" REF="4">
he conveyed them to the pre&s;s, I mu&s;t not &s;ay altogether with my con&s;ent, nor wholly without it. I thought them too good to be lo&s;t in oblivion, and had no cau&s;e to apprehend the di&s;obliging of any. The public, viz. all per&s;ons of ta&s;te and judgment, would be plea&s;ed with &s;o agreeable an amu&s;ement; Mr. Cromwell could not be angry, &s;ince it was but ju&s;tice to his merit, to publi&s;h the &s;olemn and private profe&s;&s;ions of love, gratitude, and veneration, made him by &s;o celebrated an author; and &s;in|cerely Mr. Pope ought not to re&s;ent the publi|cation, &s;ince the early pregnancy of his genius was no di&s;honour to his character. And yet had either of you been a&s;ked, common mo|de&s;ty would have obliged you to refu&s;e, what you would not be di&s;plea&s;ed with, if done without your knowledge. And be&s;ides, to end all di&s;pute, you had been plea&s;ed to make me a free gift of them, to do what I plea&s;ed with them; and every one knows, that the per&s;on to whom a letter is addre&s;&s;ed, has the &s;ame right to di&s;po&s;e of it, as he has of goods pur|cha&s;ed with his money. I doubt not but your genero&s;ity and honour will do me the right, of owning by a line that I came hone&s;tly by them. I flatter my&s;elf, in a few months I &s;hall again be vi&s;ible to the world; and whenever thro' good providence that turn &s;hall happen,
<PB N="iv" REF="5">

<P>WHEN the&s;e letters were fir&s;t printed, I wondered how Curll could come by them, and could not but laugh at the pompous title; &s;ince whatever you wrote to me was hu|mour, and familiar raillery. As &s;oon as I came from Ep&s;om, I heard you had been to &s;ee me, and I writ you a &s;hort letter from Will's, that I longed to &s;ee you. Mr. D&mdash;s, about that time charged me with giving them to a mi|&s;tre&s;s, which I po&s;itively denied: not in the lea&s;t, at that time, thinking of it; but &s;ome time after, finding in the News papers Letters
<PB N="v" REF="6">
from Lady Packington, Lady Chudleigh, and Mr. Norris to the &s;ame Sappho or E. T. I be|gan to fear that I was guilty. I have never &s;een the&s;e Letters of Curll's, nor would go to his &s;hop about them; I have not &s;een this Sappho alias E. T. the&s;e &s;even years.&mdash;Her writing, <HI>That I gave her 'em, to do what I would with 'em,</HI> is &s;training the point too far. I thought not of it, nor do I think &s;he did then; but &s;e|vere nece&s;&s;ity which catches hold of a twig, has produced all this; which has lain hid, and forgot, by me &s;o many years. Curll &s;ent me a letter la&s;t week, de&s;iring a po&s;itive an&s;wer about this matter, but finding I would give him none, he went to E. T. and writ a po&s;t&s;cript in her long romantick letter, to direct my an|&s;wer to his hou&s;e; but they not expecting an an&s;wer, &s;ent a young man to me, who&s;e name, it &s;eems, is Patti&s;on. I told him I &s;hould not write any thing, but I believed it might be &s;o as &s;he writ in her letter. I am extremely con|cerned that my former indi&s;cretion in putting them into the hands of this <HI>Pretieu&s;e,</HI> &s;hould have given you &s;o much di&s;turbance; for the la&s;t thing I &s;hould do would be to di&s;oblige you, for whom I have ever pre&s;erved the greate&s;t e&s;teem, and &s;hall ever be, Sir,</P>

<P>THO' I writ my long narrative from Ep|&s;om 'till I was tired, yet was I not &s;a|tisfied; le&s;t any doubt &s;hould re&s;t upon your mind. I could not make prote&s;tations of my innocence of a grievous crime; but I was im|patient till I came to town, that I might &s;end you tho&s;e Letters, as a clear evidence that I was a perfect &s;tranger to all their proceeding. Should I have prote&s;ted again&s;t it, after the printing, it might have been taken for an at|tempt to decry his purcha&s;e; and as the little exception you have taken has &s;erved him to play his game upon us for the&s;e two years, a new incident from me might enable him to play it on for two more.&mdash;The great value &s;he expre&s;&s;es for all you write, and her pa&s;&s;ion for having them, I believe, was what prevailed upon me to let her keep them. By the inter|val of twelve years at lea&s;t, from her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to the time of printing them, 'tis manife&s;t, that I had not the lea&s;t ground to apprehend &s;uch a de&s;ign: but as people in great &s;traits, bring forth their hoards of old gold and mo&s;t valued

jewels; &s;o Sappho had recour&s;e to her hid trea|&s;ure of Letters, and played off not only your's to me, but all tho&s;e to her&s;elf (as the lady's la&s;t &s;take) into the pre&s;s.&mdash;As for me, I hope, when you &s;hall cooly con&s;ider the many thou|&s;and in&s;tances of our being deluded by the fe|males, &s;ince that great Original of Adam by Eve, you will have a more favourable thought of the unde&s;igning error of</P>

Nor has Mr. P. him&s;elf any great cau&s;e to think it much offence to his mode&s;ty, or reflection on his judgment; when we take care to inform the public, that there are few Letters of his in this collection, which were not writ|ten under twenty years of age: on the other hand, we doubt not the reader will be much

<HEAD>PREFACE</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Prefixed to the Fir&s;t Genuine Edition in quarto, 1737.</HEAD>
<P>IF what is here offered the reader, &s;hould happen in any degree to plea&s;e him, the thanks are not due to the author, but partly to his friends, and partly to his enemies: it was wholly owing to the affection of the for|mer, that &s;o many Letters, of which he never kept copies, were pre&s;erved; and to the ma|lice of the latter, that they were produced in this manner.</P>
<P>He had been very di&s;agreeably u&s;ed, in the publication of &s;ome Letters written in his youth, which fell into the hands of a woman who printed them, without his, or his corre&s;|pondent's con&s;ent, in 1727. This treatment, and the apprehen&s;ion of more of the &s;ame kind, put him upon recalling as many as he could from tho&s;e who he imagined had kept any. He was &s;orry to find the number &s;o great, but immediately le&s;&s;ened it by burning three parts in four of them: the re&s;t he
<PB N="xiii" REF="14">
&s;pared, not in any preference of their &s;tyle or writing, but merely as they pre&s;erved the me|mory of &s;ome friend&s;hips which will ever be dear to him, or &s;et in a true light &s;ome mat|ters of fact, from which the &s;criblers of the times had taken occa&s;ion to a&s;per&s;e either his friends or him&s;elf. He therefore lay'd by the Originals, together with tho&s;e of his corre&s;|pondents, and cau&s;ed a copy to be taken to de|po&s;ite in the library of a noble friend; that in ca&s;e either of the revival of &s;landers, or the publication of &s;urreptitious Letters, during his life or after, a proper u&s;e might be made of them.</P>
<P>The next year, the po&s;thumous works of Mr. Wycherley were printed, in a way di&s;repu|table enough to his memory. It was thought a ju&s;tice due to him, to &s;hew the world his bet|ter judgment; and that it was his la&s;t re&s;olu|tion to have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed tho&s;e poems. As &s;ome of the Letters which had pa&s;&s;ed between him and our author cleared that point, they were publi&s;hed in 1729, with a few marginal notes added by a friend.</P>
<P>If in the&s;e Letters, and in tho&s;e which were printed without his con&s;ent, there appear too much of a juvenile ambition of wit, or affe|ctation of gaiety, he may rea&s;onably hope it will be con&s;idered to <HI>whom,</HI> and at <HI>what age,</HI>
<PB N="xiv" REF="15">
he was guilty of it, as well as how &s;oon it was over. The re&s;t, every judge of writing will &s;ee, were by no means efforts of the genius, but emanations of the heart: and this alone may induce any candid reader to believe their publication an act of nece&s;&s;ity, rather than of vanity.</P>
<P>It is notorious, how many volumes have been publi&s;hed under the title of his corre&s;pon|dence, with promi&s;es &s;till of more, and open and repeated offers of encouragement to all per|&s;ons who &s;hould &s;end any letters of his for the pre&s;s. It is as notorious what methods were taken to procure them, even from the pub|li&s;her's own accounts in his prefaces, viz. by tran&s;acting with people in nece&s;&s;ities,<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See the Preface to vol. i. of a Book called Mr. Pope's Literary Corre&s;pondence.</NOTE> or of abandoned<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Po&s;t&s;cript to the Preface to vol. iv.</NOTE> characters, or &s;uch as dealt without names in the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Narrative and Anecdotes before vol. ii.</NOTE> dark. Upon a quarrel with one of the&s;e la&s;t, he betrayed him&s;elf &s;o far, as to appeal to the public in Narratives and Adverti&s;ements: like that Iri&s;h highway-man a few years before, who preferr'd a bill again&s;t his companion, for not &s;haring equally in the money, rings and watches, they had traded for in partner&s;hip upon Houn&s;low-heath.</P>
<P><PB N="xv" REF="16">
Several have been printed in his name which he never writ, and addre&s;&s;ed to per&s;ons to whom they never were written <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In Vol. iii. Letters from Mr. Pope to Mrs. Blount, &amp;c.</NOTE>; counterfeited as from bi&s;hop Atterbury to him, which neither that bi&s;hop nor he ever &s;aw <NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vol. ii. of the &s;ame, 8&deg;. pag. 20. and at the end of the Edition of his Letters in 12&deg;, by the book&s;ellers of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter; and of the la&s;t Edition in 12&deg;, printed for T. Cooper, 1725.</NOTE>; and advertized even after that period when it was made felony to corre&s;pond with him.</P>
<P>I know not how it has been this author's fate, whom both his &s;ituation and his temper have all his life excluded from rivalling any man, in any preten&s;ion, (except that of plea&s;ing by poetry) to have been as much a&s;per&s;ed and writ|ten at, as any Fir&s;t Mini&s;ter of his time: pam|phlets and news-papers have been full of him, nor was it <HI>there only</HI> that a private man, who never troubled either the world or common conver&s;ation with his opinions of Religion or Government, has been repre&s;ented as a danger|ous member of Society, a bigotted Papi&s;t, and an enemy to the E&s;tabli&s;hment. The unwar|rantable publication of his Letters hath at lea&s;t done him this &s;ervice, to &s;hew he has con&s;tant|ly enjoyed the friend&s;hip of worthy men; and that if a catalogue were to be taken of his
<PB N="xvi" REF="17">
friends and his enemies, he needs not to blu&s;h at either. Many of them having been written on the mo&s;t trying occurrences, and all in the openne&s;s of friend&s;hip, are a proof what were his real &s;entiments, as they flowed warm from the heart, and fre&s;h from the occa&s;ion; with|out the lea&s;t thought that ever the world &s;hould be witne&s;s to them. Had he &s;ate down with a de&s;ign to draw his own picture, he could not have done it &s;o truly; for whoever &s;its for it (whether to him&s;elf or another) will inevitably find the features more compo&s;ed, than his ap|pear in the&s;e letters. But if an author's hand, like a painter's, be more di&s;tingui&s;hable in a &s;light &s;ketch than in a fini&s;hed picture, this very carele&s;sne&s;s will make them the better known from &s;uch counterfeits, as have been, and may be imputed to him, either through a mercenary or a malicious de&s;ign.</P>
<P>We hope it is needle&s;s to &s;ay, he is not ac|countable for &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the &s;urreptiti|ous editions of tho&s;e Letters, which are &s;uch as no man of common &s;en&s;e would have pub|li&s;hed him&s;elf. The errors of the pre&s;s were almo&s;t innumerable, and could not but be ex|tremely multiplied in &s;o many repeated edi|tions, by the avarice and negligence of pira|tical printers, to not one of whom he ever
<PB N="xvii" REF="18">
gave the lea&s;t Title, or any other encourage|ment than that of not pro&s;ecuting them.</P>
<P>For the <HI>Cha&s;ms</HI> in the corre&s;pondence, we had not the means to &s;upply them, the Author having de&s;troyed too many Letters to pre&s;erve any Series. Nor would he go about to amend them, except by the omi&s;&s;ion of &s;ome pa&s;&s;ages, improper, or at lea&s;t impertinent, to be di|vulged to the publick: or of &s;uch entire Let|ters, as were either not his, or not approved of by him.</P>
<P>He has been very &s;paring of tho&s;e of his Friends, and thought it a re&s;pect &s;hown to their memory, to &s;uppre&s;s in particular &s;uch as were mo&s;t in his favour. As it is not to <HI>Vanity</HI> but to <HI>Friend&s;hip</HI> that he intends this Monu|ment, he would &s;ave his enemies the mortifi|cation of &s;howing any further how well their Betters have thought of him: and at the &s;ame time &s;ecure from their cen&s;ure his living Friends, who (he promi&s;es them) &s;hall never be put to the blu&s;h, this way at lea&s;t, for their partiality to him.</P>
<P>But however this Collection may be received, we cannot but lament the <HI>Cau&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Ne|ce&s;&s;ity</HI> of &s;uch a publication, and heartily wi&s;h no hone&s;t man may be reduced to the &s;ame.

<P>Therefore I will &s;ay no more now of them, than that your good wit never forfeited your good judgment, but in your partiality to me and mine; &s;o that if it were po&s;&s;ible for a hardened &s;cribler to be vainer than he is, what you write of me would make me more conceited than what I &s;crible my&s;elf: yet, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, I ought to be more humbled by your prai&s;e than exalted, which commends my little &s;en&s;e with &s;o much more of yours, that I am di&s;paraged and di&s;heartened by your commendations; who give me an example of your wit in the fir&s;t part of your letter, and a definition of it in the la&s;t; to make writing well (that is, like you) more difficult to me than ever it was before.

<P>WHEN I write to you, I fore&s;ee a long letter, and ought to beg your patience before-hand; for if it proves the longe&s;t, it will be of cour&s;e the wor&s;t I have troubled you with. Yet to expre&s;s my gratitude at large for your obliging letter, is not more my duty than my intere&s;t; as &s;ome people will abundantly thank you for one piece of kindne&s;s, to put you in mind of be&s;towing another. The more fa|vourable you are to me, the more di&s;tinctly I &s;ee my faults: Spots and blemi&s;hes, you know, are never &s;o plainly di&s;covered as in the bright|e&s;t &s;un&s;hine. Thus I am mortified by tho&s;e commendations which were de&s;igned to encou|rage me: for prai&s;e to a young wit, is like rain to a tender flower; if it be moderately be&s;tow|ed, it chears and revives; but if too lavi&s;hly, overcharges and depre&s;&s;es him. Mo&s;t men in years, as they are generally di&s;couragers of youth, are like old trees, that, being pa&s;t bear|ing

<P>YOUR letter of the twenty-fifth of March I have received, which was more wel|come
<PB N="10" REF="42">
to me than any thing could be out of the country, tho' it were one's rent due that day; and I can find no fault with it, but that it charges me with want of &s;incerity, or ju&s;tice, for giving you your due; who &s;hould not let your mode&s;ty be &s;o unju&s;t to your merit, as to reject what is due to it, and call that compli|ment, which is &s;o &s;hort of your de&s;ert, that it is rather degrading than exalting you. But if com|pliment be the &s;moke only of friend&s;hip (as you &s;ay) however, you mu&s;t allow there is no &s;moke but there is &s;ome fire; and as the &s;acrifice of incen&s;e offered to the Gods would not have been half &s;o &s;weet to others, if it had not been for its &s;moke; &s;o friend&s;hip, like love, cannot be without &s;ome incen&s;e, to perfume the name it would prai&s;e and immortalize. But &s;ince you &s;ay you do not write to me to gain my prai&s;e, but my affection, pray how is it po&s;&s;ible to have the one without the other? we mu&s;t admire before we love. You affirm, you would have me &s;o much your friend as to appear your ene|my, and find out your faults rather than your perfections; but (my friend) that would be &s;o hard to do, that I, who love no difficulties, can't be per&s;uaded to it. Be&s;ides, the vanity of a &s;cribler is &s;uch, that he will never part with his own judgment to gratify another's; e&s;pecially when he mu&s;t take pains to do it: and tho' I

<P>I Have received yours of the fifth, wherein your mode&s;ty refu&s;es the ju&s;t prai&s;es I give you, by which you lay claim to more, as a bi&s;hop gains his bi&s;hopric by &s;aying he will not epi&s;copate; but I mu&s;t confe&s;s, whil&s;t I di&s;plea&s;e you by commending you, I plea&s;e my&s;elf: ju&s;t as incen&s;e is &s;weeter to the offerer

<P>As to my enquiry after your intrigues with the Mu&s;es, you may allow me to make it, &s;ince no old man can give &s;o young, &s;o great, and able a favourite of theirs, jealou&s;y.

<P>I Cannot contend with you: You mu&s;t give me leave at once to wave all your compli|ments, and to collect only this in general from them, that your de&s;ign is to encourage me. But I &s;eparate from all the re&s;t that paragraph or two, in which you make me &s;o warm an offer of your Friend&s;hip. Were I po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that, it would put an end to all tho&s;e &s;peeches with which you now make me blu&s;h; and change them to whol&s;ome advices, and free &s;entiments, which might make me wi&s;er and happier. I know 'tis the general opinion, that friend&s;hip is be&s;t contracted betwixt per&s;ons of equal age; but I have &s;o much intere&s;t to be of another mind, that you mu&s;t pardon me if I can|not forbear telling you a few notions of mine, in oppo&s;ition to that opinion.</P>
<P>In the fir&s;t place 'tis ob&s;ervable, that the love we bear to our friends, is generally cau&s;ed by our finding the &s;ame di&s;po&s;itions in them, which we feel in our&s;elves. This is but &s;elf-love at the bottom: whereas the affection betwixt peo|ple of different ages cannot well be &s;o, the in|clinations of &s;uch being commonly various. The friend&s;hip of two young men is often oc|ca&s;ioned
<PB N="14" REF="46">
by love of plea&s;ure or voluptuou&s;ne&s;s, each being de&s;irous for his own &s;ake of one to a&s;&s;i&s;t or encourage him in the cour&s;es he pur|&s;ues; as that of two old men is frequently on the &s;core of &s;ome profit, lucre, or de&s;ign upon others. Now, as a young man who is le&s;s ac|quainted with the ways of the world, has in all probability le&s;s of intere&s;t; and an old man, who may be weary of him&s;elf, has, or &s;hould have le&s;s of &s;elf-love; &s;o the friend&s;hip between them is the more likely to be true, and un|mixed with too much &s;elf-regard. One may add to this, that &s;uch a friend&s;hip is of greater u&s;e and advantage to both; for the old man will grow gay and agreeable to plea&s;e the young one; and the young man more di&s;creet and prudent by the help of the old one: &s;o it may prove a cure of tho&s;e epidemical di&s;ea&s;es of age and youth, &s;ourne&s;s and madne&s;s. I hope you will not need many arguments to convince you of the po&s;&s;ibility of this; one alone abundantly &s;a|tisfies me, and convinces to the heart; which is, that<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Mr. Wycherley was at this time about &s;eventy years old, Mr. Pope under &s;eventeen. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> young as I am, and old as you are, I am your entirely affectionate, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Should believe my&s;elf happy in your good opinion, but that you treat me &s;o much in a &s;tyle of compliment. It hath been ob&s;erved of women, that they are more &s;ubject in their youth to be touched with vanity, than men, on account of their being generally treated this way; but the weake&s;t women are not more weak than that cla&s;s of men, who are thought to pique them&s;elves upon their Wit. The world is never wanting, when a coxcomb is accompli&s;hing him&s;elf, to help to give him the fini&s;hing &s;troke.</P>
<P>Every man is apt to think his neighbour over|&s;tock'd with vanity, yet, I cannot but fancy there are certain times, when mo&s;t people are in a di&s;po&s;ition of being informed; and 'tis incredi|ble what a va&s;t good a little truth might do, &s;poken in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons. A &s;mall alms will do a great kindne&s;s, to people in extreme nece&s;&s;ity.</P>
<P>I could name an acquaintance of yours, who would at this time think him&s;elf more obliged to you for the information of his faults, than the confirmation of his follies. If you would make tho&s;e the &s;ubject of a letter, it might be as long as I could wi&s;h your letters always were.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="48">
I do not wonder you have hitherto found &s;ome difficulty (as you are plea&s;ed to &s;ay) in writing to me, &s;ince you have always cho&s;en the ta&s;k of commending me: take but the other way, and, I dare engage, you will find none at all.</P>
<P>As for my ver&s;es, which you prai&s;e &s;o much, I may truly &s;ay they have never been the cau&s;e of any vanity in me, except what they gave me when they fir&s;t occa&s;ioned my acquaintance with you. But I have &s;everal times &s;ince been in danger of this vice; as often, I mean, as I re|ceived any letters from you. 'Tis certain, the greate&s;t magnifying gla&s;&s;es in the world are a man's own eyes when they look upon his own per&s;on; yet even in tho&s;e, I cannot fancy my|&s;elf &s;o extremely like Alexander the great, as you would per&s;uade me. If I mu&s;t be like him, 'tis you will make me &s;o, by compliment|ing me into a better opinion of my&s;elf than I de&s;erve: They made him think he was the &s;on of Jupiter, and you a&s;&s;ure me I am a man of parts. But is this all you can &s;ay to my ho|nour? you &s;aid ten times as much before, when you call'd me your friend. After having made me believe I po&s;&s;e&s;s'd a &s;hare in your affection, to treat me with compliments and &s;weet &s;ayings, is like the proceeding with poor Sancho Panca: they per&s;uaded him that he enjoy'd a great do|minion,
<PB N="17" REF="49">
and then gave him nothing to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon but wafers and marmalade. In our days the greate&s;t obligation you can lay upon a Wit, is to make a fool of him. For as when mad|men are found incurable, wi&s;e men give them their way, and plea&s;e them as well as they can; &s;o when tho&s;e incorrigible things, Poets, are once irrecoverably be-mus'd, the be&s;t way both to quiet them, and &s;ecure your&s;elf from the effects of their frenzy, is to feed their vanity; which indeed, for the mo&s;t part, is all that is fed in a poet.</P>
<P>You may believe me, I could be heartily glad that all you &s;ay were as true, applied to me, as it would be to your&s;elf, for &s;everal weighty rea&s;ons; but for none &s;o much as that I might be to you what you de&s;erve; whereas I can now be no more than is con&s;i&s;tent with the &s;mall tho' utmo&s;t capacity of &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Have now changed the &s;cene from the town to the country; from Will's coffee-hou&s;e to Wind&s;or-fore&s;t. I find no other difference than this, betwixt the common town-wits, and the downright country fools; that the fir&s;t are

pertly in the wrong, with a little more flouri&s;h and gayety; and the la&s;t neither in the right nor the wrong, but confirmed in a &s;tupid &s;et|tled medium betwixt both. However, me|thinks, the&s;e are mo&s;t in the right, who quietly and ea&s;ily re&s;ign them&s;elves over to the gentle reign of dulne&s;s, which the Wits mu&s;t do at la&s;t, tho' after a great deal of noi&s;e, and re&s;i&s;t|ance. Ours are a &s;ort of mode&s;t inoffen&s;ive people, who neither have &s;en&s;e, nor pretend to any, but enjoy a jovial &s;ort of dulne&s;s: They are commonly known in the world by the name of hone&s;t, civil gentlemen: They live, much as they ride, at random; a kind of hunting life, pur&s;uing with earne&s;tne&s;s and hazard &s;ome|thing not worth the catching; never in the way, nor out of it. I can't but prefer &s;olitude to the company of all the&s;e; for tho' a man's &s;elf may po&s;&s;ibly be the wor&s;t fellow to con|ver&s;e with in the world, yet one would think the company of a per&s;on whom we have the greate&s;t regard to and affection for, could not be very unplea&s;ant. As a man in love with a mi&s;tre&s;s, de&s;ires no conver&s;ation but hers, &s;o a man in love with him&s;elf (as mo&s;t men are) may be be&s;t plea&s;ed with his own. Be&s;ides, if the true&s;t and mo&s;t u&s;eful knowledge be the knowledge of our&s;elves, &s;olitude, conducing mo&s;t to make us look into our&s;elves, &s;hould be

the mo&s;t in&s;tructive &s;tate of life. We &s;ee no|thing more commonly, than men, who for the &s;ake of the circum&s;tantial part and mere out|&s;ide of life, have been half their days rambling out of their nature, and ought to be &s;ent into &s;olitude to &s;tudy them&s;elves over again. Peo|ple are u&s;ually &s;poiled, in&s;tead of being taught, at their coming into the world; whereas by be|ing more conver&s;ant with Ob&s;curity, without any pains, they would naturally follow what they were meant for. In a word, if a man be a coxcomb, Solitude is his be&s;t School; and if he be a fool, it is his be&s;t Sanctuary.</P>
<P>The&s;e are good rea&s;ons for my own &s;tay here, but I wi&s;h I could give you any for your com|ing hither, except that I earne&s;tly invite you. And yet I can't help &s;aying I have &s;uffered a great deal of di&s;content that you do not come, tho' I &s;o little merit that you &s;hould.</P>

Or if you mean to improve the wor&s;t pieces? which are &s;uch, as, to render them very good, would require great addi|tion, and almo&s;t the entire new writing of them. Or, la&s;tly, if you mean the middle &s;ort, as the Songs and Love-ver&s;es? For the&s;e will need only to be &s;hortened, to omit repetition; the words remaining very little different from what they were before. Pray let me know your mind in this, for I am utterly at a lo&s;s.

Yet I have try'd what I could do to &s;ome of the &s;ongs, and the poems on Lazine&s;s and Ig|norance, but can't (even in my own partial judgment) think my alterations much to the purpo&s;e. So that I mu&s;t needs de&s;ire you would apply your care wholly at pre&s;ent to tho&s;e which are yet unpubli&s;hed, of which there are more than enough to make a con&s;iderable volume, of full as good ones, nay, I believe, of better than any in Vol. I. which I could wi&s;h you would defer, at lea&s;t 'till you have fini&s;h'd the&s;e that are yet unprinted.</P>
<P>I &s;end you a &s;ample of &s;ome few of the&s;e; namely, the ver&s;es to Mr. Waller in his old age; your new ones on the Duke of Marlbo|rough, and two others.

<P>MR.

I am &s;orry you told the great man, whom you met in the court of reque&s;ts, that your papers were in my hands: no man alive &s;hall ever know any

<P>The method of the copy I &s;end you is very different from what it was, and much more re|gular: for the better help of your memory, I de&s;ire you to compare it by the figures in the margin, an&s;wering to the &s;ame in this letter. The poem is now divided into four parts, mark'd with the literal figures 1. 2. 3. 4. The fir&s;t contains the Prai&s;e of Dulne&s;s, and &s;hews how upon &s;everal &s;uppo&s;itions it pa&s;&s;es for 1. religion. 2. philo&s;ophy. 3. example. 4. wit. and 5. the cau&s;e of wit, and the end of it. The &s;econd part contains the Advantages of Dul|ne&s;s; 1&s;t, in bu&s;ine&s;s; and 2dly, at Court; where the &s;imilitudes of the Bya&s;s of a bowl, and the Weights of a clock, are directly tending to the &s;ubject, tho' introduced before in a place where there was no mention made of tho&s;e ad|vantages (which was your only objection to my adding them.) The third contains the Happine&s;s of Dulne&s;s in all &s;tations, and &s;hews in a great many particulars, that it is &s;o fortu|nate as to be e&s;teem'd &s;ome good quality or other in all &s;orts of people; that it is thought quiet, &s;en&s;e, caution, policy, prudence, maje&s;ty, valour, circum&s;pection, hone&s;ty, &amp;c. The
<PB N="30" REF="62">
fourth part I have wholly added, as a climax which &s;ums up all the prai&s;e, advantage, and happine&s;s of Dulne&s;s in a few words, and &s;trengthens them by the oppo&s;ition of the di&s;|grace, di&s;advantage, and unhappine&s;s of Wit, with which it concludes <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This is totally omitted in the pre&s;ent Edition: Some of the lines are the&s;e:

For you are &s;en&s;ible, the omi&s;&s;ion of Repetitions is but one, and the ea&s;ie&s;t part, of yours and my de|&s;ign; there remaining be&s;ides to rectify the Method, to connect the Matter, and to mend the Expre&s;&s;ion and Ver&s;ification.

<P>I Am glad you receiv'd the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jacob Ton&s;on's &s;ixth Vol. of Mi&s;cellany Poems. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> Mi&s;cellany, if it were only to &s;how you that there are as bad poets in this nation as your &s;ervant. This modern cu&s;tom of appearing in mi&s;cellanies, is very u&s;eful to the poets, who, like other thieves, e&s;cape by getting into a crowd, and herd toge|ther like Banditti, &s;afe only in their multitude. Methinks Strada has given a good de&s;cription of the&s;e kind of collections; <HI>Nullus hodie mor|talium aut na&s;citur, aut moritur, aut praeliatur, aut ru&s;ticatur, aut abit peregre, aut redit, aut nubit, aut e&s;t, aut non e&s;t, (nam etiam mortuis i&s;ti canunt) cui non illi extemplo cudant Epice|dia, Genethliaca, Protreptica, Panegyrica, Epi|thalamia, Vaticinia, Propemptica, Soterica, Pa|raenetica, Naenias, Nugas.</HI> As to the &s;ucce&s;s which, you &s;ay, my part has met with, it is to be attributed to what you was pleas'd to &s;ay of me to the world; which you do well to call your prophecy, &s;ince whatever is &s;aid in my favour, mu&s;t be a prediction of things that are not yet; you, like a true Godfather, engage on my part for much more than ever I can per|form.

My pa&s;toral Mu&s;e, like other country girls, is but put out of countenance, by what you courtiers &s;ay to her; yet I hope you would not deceive me too far, as knowing that a young &s;cribler's vanity needs no recruits from abroad: for nature, like an indulgent mother, kindly takes care to &s;upply her &s;ons with as much of their own, as is nece&s;&s;ary for their &s;atisfaction. If my ver&s;es &s;hould meet with a few flying commendations, Virgil has taught me, that a young author has not too much rea&s;on to be pleas'd with them, when he con&s;iders that the natural con&s;equence of prai&s;e is envy and calumny.

When once a man has appear'd as a poet, he may give up his preten&s;ions to all the rich and thriving arts: tho&s;e who have once made their court to tho&s;e mi&s;tre&s;&s;es without portions, the Mu&s;es, are never like to &s;et up for fortunes. But for my part, I &s;hall be &s;atisfy'd if I can lo&s;e my time agreeably this way, without lo&s;ing my re|putation: as for gaining any, I am as indiffer|ent in the matter as Fal&s;taffe was, and may &s;ay of fame as he did of honour, <Q>&startq;If it comes, it comes unlook'd for; and there's an end on't.&endq;</Q> I can be content with a bare &s;aving

<P>THE la&s;t I receiv'd from you was dated the 22d of May. I take your charitable hint to me very kindly, wherein you do like a true friend, and a true chri&s;tian, and I &s;hall en|deavour to follow your advice, as well as your example.&mdash;As for your wi&s;hing to &s;ee your friend an Hermit with you, I cannot be &s;aid to leave the world, &s;ince I &s;hall enjoy in your con|ver&s;ation all that I can de&s;ire of it; nay, can learn more from you alone, than from my

<P>As to the &s;ucce&s;s of your poems in the late mi&s;cellany, which I told you of in my la&s;t; upon my word I made you no compliment, for you may be a&s;&s;ur'd that all &s;ort of readers like them, except they are writers too; but for them (I mu&s;t needs &s;ay) the more they like them, they ought to be the le&s;s pleas'd with 'em: &s;o that you do not come off with a bare &s;aving game (as you call it) but have gain'd &s;o much credit at fir&s;t, that you mu&s;t needs &s;up|port it to the la&s;t: &s;ince you &s;et up with &s;o great a &s;tock of good &s;en&s;e, judgment, and wit, that your judgment en&s;ures all that your wit ven|tures at. The &s;alt of your wit has been enough to give a reli&s;h to the whole in&s;ipid hotch-potch it is mingled with; and you will make Jacob's Ladder rai&s;e you to immortality, by which others are turn'd off &s;hamefully to their dam|nation (for poetic thieves as they are) who think to be &s;av'd by others good works, how faulty &s;oever their own are: but the coffee|hou&s;e wits, or rather anti-wits the critics, prove their judgments by approving your wit; and even the news-mongers and poets will own, you have more invention than they; nay, the detracters or the envious, who never &s;peak well of any body (not even of tho&s;e they think well

<P>MY letters, &s;o much inferior to yours, can only make up their &s;carcity of &s;en&s;e by their number of lines; which is like the Spa|niards paying a debt of gold with a load of bra&s;s money. But to be a <HI>plain dealer,</HI> I mu&s;t tell you, I will revenge the raillery of your letters by printing them (as Dennis did mine) with|out your knowledge too, which wou'd be a re|venge upon your judgment for the raillery of your wit; for &s;ome dull rogues (that is the mo&s;t in the world) might be &s;uch fools as to think what you &s;aid of me was in earne&s;t: It is not the fir&s;t time, your great wits have gain'd reputation by their paradoxical or ironical prai&s;es; your forefathers have done it, Era&s;mus and others.

<P>I Have had yours of the 30th of the la&s;t month, which is kinder than I de&s;ire it &s;hould be, &s;ince it tells me you cou'd be better pleas'd to
<PB N="47" REF="79">
be &s;ick again in Town in my company, than to be well in the Country without it; and that you are more impatient to be depriv'd of hap|pine&s;s than of health. Yet, my dear friend, &s;et raillery or compliment a&s;ide, I can bear your ab&s;ence (which procures your health and ea&s;e) better than I can your company when you are in pain: for I cannot &s;ee you &s;o with|out being &s;o too. Your love to the Country I do not doubt, nor do you (I hope) my love to it or you, &s;ince there I can enjoy your com|pany without &s;eeing you in pain to give me &s;a|tisfaction and plea&s;ure; there I can have you without rivals or di&s;turbers; without the too civil, or the too rude: without the noi&s;e of the loud, or the cen&s;ure of the &s;ilent: and wou'd rather have you abu&s;e me there with the truth, than at this di&s;tance with your compli|ment: &s;ince now, your bu&s;ine&s;s of a friend, and kindne&s;s to a friend, is by finding fault with his faults, and mending them by your obli|ging &s;everity. I hope (in point of your good|nature) you will have no cruel charity for tho&s;e papers of mine, you are &s;o willing to be trou|bled with; which I take mo&s;t infinitely kind of you, and &s;hall acknowledge with gratitude, as long as I live. No friend can do more for his friend than pre&s;erving his reputation (nay, not by pre&s;erving his life) &s;ince by pre&s;erving
<PB N="48" REF="80">
his life he can only make him live about three|&s;core or four&s;core years; but by pre&s;erving his reputation, he can make him live as long as the world la&s;ts; &s;o &s;ave him from damning, when he is gone to the devil. Therefore, I pray, condemn me in private, as the Thieves do their accomplices in Newgate, to &s;ave them from condemnation by the public. Be mo&s;t kindly unmerciful to my poetical faults, and do with my papers, as you country-gentlemen do with your trees, &s;la&s;h, cut, and lop off the excre&s;|cencies and dead parts of my wither'd bays, that the little remainder may live the longer, and increa&s;e the value of them by dimini&s;hing the number. I have troubled you with my papers rather to give you pain than plea&s;ure, notwith&s;tanding your compliment, which &s;ays you take the trouble kindly: &s;uch is your ge|nero&s;ity to your friends, that you take it kind|ly to be de&s;ired by them to do them a kind|ne&s;s; and you think it done to you, when they give you an opportunity to do it them. Where|fore you may be &s;ure to be troubled with my letters out of intere&s;t, if not kindne&s;s; &s;ince mine to you will procure yours to me: &s;o that I write to you more for my own &s;ake than yours; le&s;s to make you think I write well, than to learn from you to write better. Thus you &s;ee intere&s;t in my kindne&s;s, which is like

the friend&s;hip of the world, rather to make a friend than be a friend; but I am yours, as a true Plain-dealer.</P>

<P>IF I can do part of my bu&s;ine&s;s at Shrew&s;|bury in a fortnight's time (which I propo&s;e to do) I will be &s;oon after with you, and trou|ble you with my company, for the remainder of the &s;ummer: in the mean time I beg you to give your&s;elf the pains of altering, or leaving out what you think &s;uperfluous in my papers, that I may endeavour to print &s;uch a number of them as you and I &s;hall think fit, about Mi|chaelmas next. In order to which (my dear friend) I beg you to be &s;o kind to me, as to be &s;evere to them; that the critics may be le&s;s &s;o; for I had rather be condemn'd by my friend in private, than expos'd to my foes in public, the critics, or common judges, who are made &s;uch by having been old offenders them&s;elves. Pray, believe I have as much faith in your friend&s;hip and &s;incerity, as I have de|ference to your judgment; and as the be&s;t mark
<PB N="50" REF="82">

Pray then take pity at once both of my readers and me, in &s;hort|ning my barren abundance, and increa&s;ing their patience by it, as well as the obligations I have to you: And &s;ince no madrigaller can enter|tain the head, unle&s;s he plea&s;es the ear; and &s;ince the crowded Opera's have left the be&s;t Comedies with the leaft audiences, 'tis a &s;ign &s;ound can prevail over &s;en&s;e; therefore &s;often my words, and &s;trengthen my &s;en&s;e, and

<P>I Receiv'd your mo&s;t extreme kind letter but ju&s;t now. It found me over tho&s;e papers you mention, which have been my employ|ment ever &s;ince Ea&s;ter-monday: I hope before Michaelmas to have di&s;charg'd my ta&s;k; which, upon the word of a friend, is the mo&s;t plea&s;ing one I cou'd be put upon. Since you are &s;o near going into Shrop&s;hire, (whither I &s;hall not care to write of this matter for fear of the mi&s;car|riage of any letters) I mu&s;t de&s;ire your leave to give you a plain and &s;incere account of what I have found from a more &s;erious application to them. Upon compari&s;on with the former volume, I find much more repeated than I till now imagin'd, as well as in the pre&s;ent vo|lume, which, if (as you told me la&s;t) you would have me da&s;h over with a line, will de|face the whole copy extremely, and to a de|gree that (I fear) may di&s;plea&s;e you. I have every where mark'd in the margins the page and line, both in this and the other part. But if you order me not to cro&s;s the lines, or would any way el&s;e limit my commi&s;&s;ion, you will oblige me by doing it in your next letter; for I am at once equally fearful of &s;paring you, and
<PB N="52" REF="84">
of offending you by too impudent a correction. Hitherto however I have cro&s;s'd 'em &s;o as to be legible, becau&s;e you bade me. When I think all the repetitions are &s;truck out in a copy, I &s;ometimes find more upon dipping in the fir&s;t vo|lume, and the number encrea&s;es &s;o much, that, I believe, more &s;hortning will be requi&s;ite than you may be willing to bear with, unle&s;s you are in good earne&s;t re&s;olv'd to have no thought repeated. Pray, forgive this freedom, which as I mu&s;t be &s;incere in this ca&s;e &s;o I could not but take; and let me know if I am to go on at this rate, or if you would pre&s;cribe any other method.</P>
<P>I am very glad you continue your re&s;olution of &s;eeing me in my Hermitage this &s;ummer; the &s;ooner you return, the &s;ooner I &s;hall be happy, which indeed my want of any company that is entertaining or e&s;teemable, together with fre|quent infirmities and pains, hinder me from being in your ab&s;ence. 'Tis (I am &s;ure) a real truth, that my &s;ickne&s;s cannot make me quite weary of my&s;elf when I have you with me; and I &s;hall want no company but yours, when you are here.</P>
<P>You &s;ee how freely and with how little care I talk rather than write to you: this is one of the many advantages of friend&s;hip, that one can &s;ay to one's friend the things that &s;tand in need
<PB N="53" REF="85">
of pardon, and at the &s;ame time be &s;ure of it. Indeed I do not know whether or no the let|ters of friends are the wor&s;e for being fit for none el&s;e to read. 'Tis an argument of the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in a friend's good nature, when one writes &s;uch things to him as require a good por|tion of it. I have experienced yours &s;o often and &s;o long, that I can now no more doubt of the greatne&s;s of it, than I hope you do of the greatne&s;s of my affection, or of the &s;incerity with which I am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>YOU give me an account in your letter of the trouble you have undergone for me, in comparing my papers you took down with you, with the old printed volume, and with one another, of that bundle you have in your hands; among&s;t which (you &s;ay) you find nu|merous Repetitions of the &s;ame thoughts and &s;ubjects; all which, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, my want of memory has prevented me from imagining, as well as made me capable of committing: &s;ince, of all figures, that of Tautology is the la&s;t I would
<PB N="54" REF="86">
u&s;e, or lea&s;t forgive my&s;elf for. But &s;eeing is believing; wherefore I will take &s;ome pains to examine and compare tho&s;e papers in your hands with one another, as well as with the former printed copies, or books of my damn'd Mi&s;cellanies; all which (as bad a memory as I have) with a little more pains and care I think I can remedy. Therefore I would not have you give your&s;elf more trouble about them, which may prevent the plea&s;ure you have, and may give the world in writing upon new &s;ubjects of your own, whereby you will much better entertain your&s;elf and others. Now as to your remarks upon the whole volume of my papers; all that I de&s;ire of you is to mark in the margin (without defacing the copy at all) either any repetition of words, matter, or &s;en&s;e, or any thoughts, or words too much re|peated; which if you will be &s;o kind as to do for me, you will &s;upply my want of Memory with your good one, and my deficiencies of &s;en&s;e, with the infallibility of yours; which if you do, you will mo&s;t infinitely oblige me, who almo&s;t repent the trouble I have given you, &s;ince &s;o much. Now as to what you call free|dom with me, (which you de&s;ire me to forgive) you may be a&s;&s;ur'd I would not forgive you unle&s;s you did u&s;e it; for I am &s;o far from thinking your plainne&s;s an offence to me, that

I will go on the &s;ame way, if you plea&s;e; tho' truly it is (as I have often told you) my &s;incere opinion, that the greater part would make a much better figure as Single Maxims and Reflections in pro&s;e, af|ter the manner of your favourite Rochefou|cault, than in ver&s;e <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"> Mr. Wycherley lived five years after, to Decem|ber, 1715, but little pro|gre&s;s was made in this de|&s;ign, thro' his Old age, and the increa&s;e of his infirmi|ties.

I find Menage in his ob&s;ervations up|on Ta&s;&s;o's Aminta, reckons up four&s;core pa|&s;toral plays in Italian: and in looking over my old Italian books, I find a great many pa&s;tor|ral and pi&s;catory plays, which, I &s;uppo&s;e, Me|nage reckons together. I find al&s;o by Menage, that Ta&s;&s;o is not the fir&s;t that writ in that kind, he mentioning another before him which he him&s;elf had never &s;een, nor indeed have I. But as the Aminta, Pa&s;tor Fido, and Filli di Sciro of Bonarelli are the three be&s;t, &s;o, I think, there is no di&s;pute but Aminta is the be&s;t of the three: not but that the di&s;cour&s;es in Pa&s;tor Fido are more entertaining and copious in &s;everal peo|ple's opinion, tho' not &s;o proper for pa&s;toral; and the fable of Bonarelli more &s;urprizing. I do not remember many in other languages, that have written in this kind with &s;ucce&s;s. Racan's <HI>Bergeries</HI> are much inferior to his lyric
<PB N="60" REF="92">
poems; and the Spaniards are all too full of conceits. Rapin will have the de&s;ign of pa&s;to|ral plays to be taken from the Cyclops of Eu|ripides. I am &s;ure there is nothing of this kind in Engli&s;h worth mentioning, and therefore you have that field open to your&s;elf. You &s;ee I write to you without any &s;ort of con&s;traint or method, as things come into my head, and therefore u&s;e the &s;ame freedom with me, who am, &amp;c.</P>

<P>I Cannot omit the fir&s;t opportunity of making you my acknowledgments for reviewing tho&s;e papers of mine. You have no le&s;s right to correct me, than the &s;ame hand that rais'd a tree has to prune it. I am convinced as well as you, that one may correct too much; for in poetry, as in painting, a man may lay colours one upon another, till they &s;tiffen and deaden the piece. Be&s;ides, to be&s;tow heightening on every part, is mon&s;trous: &s;ome parts ought to be lower than the re&s;t; and nothing looks more ridiculous than a work, where the

thoughts, however different in their own na|ture, &s;eem all on a level: 'tis like a meadow newly mown, where weeds, gra&s;s, and flowers, are all laid even, and appear undi&s;tingui&s;h'd. I believe too that &s;ometimes our fir&s;t thoughts are the be&s;t, as the fir&s;t &s;queezing of the grapes makes the fine&s;t and riche&s;t wine.</P>
<P>I have not attempted any thing of a Pa&s;toral comedy, becau&s;e, I think, the ta&s;te of our age will not reli&s;h a poem of that &s;ort. People &s;eek for what they call wit, on all &s;ubjects, and in all places; not con&s;idering that nature loves truth &s;o well, that it hardly ever admits of flouri&s;hing: Conceit is to nature what paint is to beauty; it is not only needle&s;s, but impairs what it would improve. There is a certain maje&s;ty in &s;implicity which is far above all the quaintne&s;s of wit: in&s;omuch that the critics have excluded wit from the loftie&s;t poetry, as well as the lowe&s;t, and forbid it to the Epic no le&s;s than the Pa&s;toral. I &s;hou'd certainly di&s;|plea&s;e all tho&s;e who are charm'd with Guarini and Bonarelli, and imitate Ta&s;&s;o not only in the &s;implicity of his Thoughts, but in that of the Fable too. If &s;urprizing di&s;coveries &s;hould have place in the &s;tory of a pa&s;troal comedy, I believe it would be more agreeable to probabi|lity to make them the effects of chance than of de&s;ign; intrigue not being very con&s;i&s;tent with
<PB N="62" REF="94">
that innocence, which ought to con&s;titute a &s;hepherd's character. There is nothing in all the Aminta (as I remember) but happens by mere accident; unle&s;s it be the meeting of Aminta with Sylvia at the fountain, which is the contrivance of Daphne; and even that is the mo&s;t &s;imple in the world: the contrary is ob&s;ervable in Pa&s;tor Fido, where Cori&s;ca is &s;o perfect a mi&s;tre&s;s of intrigue, that the plot could not have been brought to pa&s;s without her. I am inclin'd to think the pa&s;toral comedy has another di&s;advantage, as to the manners: its general de&s;ign is to make us in love with the innocence of a rural life, &s;o that to introduce &s;hepherds of a vicious character mu&s;t in &s;ome mea&s;ure deba&s;e it; and hence it may come to pa&s;s, that even the virtuous characters will not &s;hine &s;o much, for want of being oppos'd to their contraries. The&s;e thoughts are purely my own, and therefore I have rea&s;on to doubt them: but I hope your judgment will &s;et me right.</P>
<P>I would beg your opinion too as to another point: it is, how far the liberty of borrowing may extend? I have defended it &s;ometimes by &s;aying, that it &s;eems not &s;o much the perfection of &s;en&s;e <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">He &s;hould rather have &s;aid, <HI>the perfection of conception.</HI></NOTE>, to &s;ay things that had never been &s;aid before, as to expre&s;s tho&s;e be&s;t that have been

&s;aid oftene&s;t; and that writers, in the ca&s;e of borrowing from others, are like trees which of them&s;elves would produce only one &s;ort of fruit, but by being grafted upon others may yield variety. A mutual commerce makes poetry flouri&s;h; but then poets, like merchants, &s;hould repay with &s;omething of their own what they take from others; not, like pyrates, make prize of all they meet. I de&s;ire you to tell me &s;incerely, if I have not &s;tretch'd this li|cence too far in the&s;e Pa&s;torals? I hope to be|come a critic by your precepts, and a poet by your example. Since I have &s;een your Eclogues, I cannot be much pleas'd with my own; how|ever you have not taken away all my vanity, &s;o long as you give me leave to profe&s;s my&s;elf</P>

<P>I Had &s;ooner return'd you thanks for the fa|vour of your letter, but that I was in hopes of giving you an account at the &s;ame time of my journey to Wind&s;or; but I am now forced to put that quite off, being engaged to go to my

corporation of Richmond in York&s;hire. I think you are perfectly in the right in your notions of Pa&s;toral; but I am of opinion, that the redun|dancy of wit you mention, tho' 'tis what plea&s;es the common people, is not what ever plea&s;es the be&s;t judges. Pa&s;tor Fido indeed has had more admirers than Aminta; but I will ven|ture to &s;ay, there is a great deal of difference between the admirers of one and the other. Cori&s;ca, which is a character generally admir'd by the ordinary judges, is intolerable in a Pa|&s;toral; and Bonarelli's fancy of making his &s;hepherde&s;s in love with two men equally, is not to be defended, whatever pains he has taken to do it. As for what you a&s;k of the liberty of Borrowing; 'tis very evident the be&s;t Latin Poets have extended this very far; and none &s;o far as Virgil, who is the be&s;t of them. As for the Greek Poets, if we cannot trace them &s;o plainly, 'tis perhaps becau&s;e we have none be|fore them; 'tis evident that mo&s;t of them bor|rowed from Homer, and Homer has been ac|cus'd of burning tho&s;e that wrote before him, that his thefts might not be di&s;cover'd. The be&s;t of the modern Poets in all languages, are tho&s;e that have the neare&s;t copied the Ancients. Indeed in all the common &s;ubjects of Poetry, the thoughts are &s;o obvious (at lea&s;t if they are natural) that whoever writes la&s;t, mu&s;t write
<PB N="65" REF="97">
things like what have been &s;aid before: But they may as well applaud the Ancients for the arts of eating and drinking, and accu&s;e the mo|derns of having &s;tolen tho&s;e inventions from them; it being evident in all &s;uch ca&s;es, that whoever liv'd fir&s;t, mu&s;t fir&s;t find them out. 'Tis true, indeed, when
<Q><L>unus et alter</L>
<L>A&s;&s;uitur pannus,</L></Q>
when there are one or two bright thoughts &s;tolen, and all the re&s;t is quite different from it, a poem makes a very fooli&s;h figure: But when 'tis all melted down together, and the Gold of the Ancients &s;o mix'd with that of the Moderns, that none can di&s;tingui&s;h the one from the other, I can never find fault with it. I cannot however but own to you, that there are others of a different opinion, and that I have &s;hewn your ver&s;es to &s;ome who have made that objec|tion to them. I have &s;o much company round me while I write this, and &s;uch a noi&s;e in my ears, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible I &s;hould write any thing but non&s;en&s;e, &s;o mu&s;t break off abruptly.</P>

<P>AT my return from the North I receiv'd the favour of your letter, which had lain there till then. Having been ab&s;ent about &s;ix weeks, I read over your Pa&s;torals again, with a great deal of plea&s;ure, and to judge the better read Virgil's Eclogues, and Spen&s;er's Calendar, at the &s;ame time; and, I a&s;&s;ure you, I continue the &s;ame opinion I had always of them. By the little hints you take upon all occa&s;ions to improve them, 'tis probable you will make them yet better again&s;t winter; tho' there is a mean to be kept even in that too, and a man may correct his ver&s;es till he takes away the true &s;pirit of them; e&s;pecially if he &s;ubmits to the correction of &s;ome who pa&s;s for great Cri|tics, by mechanical rules, and never enter into the true de&s;ign and Genius of an author. I have &s;een &s;ome of the&s;e, that would hardly al|low any one good Ode in Horace, who cry Virgil wants fancy, and that Homer is very in|correct. While they talk at this rate, one would think them above the common rate of mortals: but generally they are great admirers of Ovid and Lucan; and when they write them&s;elves, we find out all the my&s;tery. They
<PB N="67" REF="99">
&s;can their ver&s;es upon their fingers; run after Conceits and glaring thoughts; their poems are all made up of Couplets, of which the fir&s;t may be la&s;t, or the la&s;t fir&s;t, without any &s;ort of prejudice to their works; in which there is no de&s;ign, or method, or any thing natural or ju&s;t. For you are certainly in the right, that in all writings what&s;oever (not poetry only) na|ture is to be follow'd; and we &s;hould be jealous of our&s;elves for being fond of Similies, Con|ceits, and what they call &s;aying fine Things. When we were in the North, my Lord Whar|ton &s;hew'd me a letter he had receiv'd from a certain great General in Spain <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">The Earl of Peterborow.</NOTE>; I told him I would by all means have that General recall'd, and &s;et to writing here at home, for it was im|po&s;&s;ible that a man with &s;o much Wit as he &s;hew'd, could be fit to command an Army, or do any other bu&s;ine&s;s <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mr. Wal&s;h's Remark will be thought very inno|cent, when the reader is in|formed that it was made on the Earl of Peterborow, ju&s;t before the glorious cam|paigns of Barcelona and Valentia. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. As for what you &s;ay of Expre&s;&s;ion: 'tis indeed the &s;ame thing to Wit, as Dre&s;s is to Beauty: I have &s;een many women over-dre&s;s'd, and &s;everal look better in a care|le&s;s night-gown, with their hair about their ears, than Mademoi&s;elle Spanheim dre&s;s'd for a ball.

<P>AFTER the thoughts I have already &s;ent you on the &s;ubject of Engli&s;h Ver&s;ifica|tion, you de&s;ire my opinion as to &s;ome farther particulars. There are indeed certain Niceties, which, tho' not much ob&s;erved even by correct ver&s;ifiers, I cannot but think, de&s;erve to be bet|ter regarded.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="69" REF="101">
1. It is not enough that nothing offends the ear, but a good Poet will adapt the very Sounds, as well as Words, to the things he treats of. So that there is (if one may expre&s;s it &s;o) a Style of Sound. As in de&s;cribing a gliding &s;tream, the numbers &s;hould run ea&s;y and flowing; in de&s;cribing a rough torrent or deluge, &s;onorous and &s;welling, and &s;o of the re&s;t. This is evident every where in Homer and Virgil, and no where el&s;e, that I know of, to any ob&s;ervable degree. The following ex|amples will make this plain, which I have taken from <HI>Vida.</HI></P>
<LG>
<L>Molle viam tacito lap&s;u per levia radit.</L>
<L>Incedit tardo molimine &s;ub&s;idendo.</L>
<L>Luctantes ventos, tempe&s;tate&s;que &s;onoras.</L>
<L>Immen&s;o cum praecipitans ruit Oceano Nox.</L>
<L>Telum imbelle &s;ine ictu, conjecit.</L>
<L>Tolle moras, cape &s;axa manu, cape robora, Pa&s;tor.</L>
<L>Ferte citi flammas, data tela, repellite pe&s;tem.</L>
</LG>
<P>This, I think, is what very few ob&s;erve in practice, and is undoubtedly of wonderful force in imprinting the image on the reader: We have one excellent example of it in our lan|guage, Mr. Dryden's Ode on St. Caecilia's day, entitled, <HI>Alexander's Fea&s;t.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. Every nice ear mu&s;t (I believe) have ob|&s;erv'd, that in any &s;mooth Engli&s;h ver&s;e of ten
<PB N="70" REF="102">
&s;yllables, there is naturally a <HI>Pau&s;e</HI> at the fourth, fifth, or &s;ixth &s;yllable. It is upon the&s;e the ear re&s;ts, and upon the judicious change and management of which depends the variety of ver&s;ification. For example, At the fifth.
<Q><L>Where'er thy navy &barline; &s;preads her canva&s;s wings,</L></Q>
At the fourth.
<Q><L>Homage to thee &barline; and peace to all &s;he brings.</L></Q>
At the &s;ixth.
<Q><L>Like tracts of leverets &barline; in morning &s;now.</L></Q></P>
<P>Now I fancy, that, to pre&s;erve an exact Har|mony and Variety, the Pau&s;e at the 4th or 6th &s;hould not be continued above three lines toge|ther, without the interpo&s;ition of another; el&s;e it will be apt to weary the ear with one conti|nued tone, at lea&s;t it does mine: That at the 5th runs quicker, and carries not quite &s;o dead a weight, &s;o tires not &s;o much, tho' it be conti|nued longer.</P>
<P N="3">3. Another nicety is in relation to Exple|tives, whether words or &s;yllables, which are made u&s;e of purely to &s;upply a vacancy: <HI>Do</HI> before verbs plural is ab&s;olutely &s;uch; and it is not improbable but future refiners may explode <HI>did</HI> and <HI>does</HI> in the &s;ame manner, which are al|mo&s;t always u&s;ed for the &s;ake of rhime. The &s;ame cau&s;e has occa&s;ioned the promi&s;cuous u&s;e
<PB N="71" REF="103">
of <HI>you</HI> and <HI>thou</HI> to the &s;ame per&s;on, which can never &s;ound &s;o graceful as either one or the other.</P>
<P N="4">4. I would al&s;o object to the irruption of Alexandrine ver&s;es, of twelve &s;yllables, which, I think, &s;hould never be allow'd but when &s;ome remarkable beauty or propriety in them atones for the liberty: Mr. Dryden has been too free of the&s;e, e&s;pecially in his latter works. I am of the &s;ame opinion as to Triple Rhimes.</P>
<P N="5">5. I could equally object to the Repetition of the &s;ame Rhimes within four or &s;ix lines of each other, as tire&s;ome to the ear thro' their Monotony.</P>
<P N="6">6. Mono&s;yllable Lines, unle&s;s very artfully managed, are &s;tiff, or langui&s;hing: but may be beautiful to expre&s;s Melancholy, Slowne&s;s, or Labour.</P>
<P N="7">7. To come to the Hiatus, or Gap between two words, which is caus'd by two vowels opening on each other (upon which you de&s;ire me to be particular) I think the rule in this ca&s;e is either to u&s;e the Cae&s;ura, or admit the Hiatus, ju&s;t as the ear is lea&s;t &s;hock'd by either: For the Cae&s;ura &s;ometimes offends the ear more than the Hiatus it&s;elf, and our language is naturally overcharg'd with con&s;onants: As for example; If in this ver&s;e,
<Q><PB N="72" REF="104">
<L>The old have Int're&s;t ever in their eye,</L></Q>
we &s;hould &s;ay, to avoid the Hiatus,
<Q><L>But th' old have int're&s;t.</L></Q></P>
<P>The Hiatus which has the wor&s;t effect, is when one word ends with the &s;ame vowel that begins the following; and next to this, tho&s;e vowels who&s;e &s;ounds come neare&s;t to each other, are mo&s;t to be avoided. O, A, or U, will bear a more full and graceful Sound than E, I, or Y. I know, &s;ome people will think the&s;e Ob&s;ervations trivial, and therefore I am glad to corroborate them by &s;ome great autho|rities, which I have met with in Tully and Quintilian. In the fourth book of Rhetoric to Herennius, are the&s;e words: <HI>Fugiemus crebras vocalium concur&s;iones, quae va&s;tam atque hiantem reddunt or ationem; ut hoc e&s;t, Baccae aeneae amoe|ni&s;&s;imae impendebant.</HI> And Quintilian l. ix. cap. 4. <HI>Vocalium concur&s;us cum accidit, hiat &amp; inter|&s;i&s;tit, &amp; qua&s;i laborat oratio. Pe&s;&s;imi longe quae ea&s;dem inter &s;e literas committunt, &s;onabunt: Praecipuus tamen erit hiatus earum quae cavo aut patulo ore efferuntur.</HI> E <HI>plenior litera e&s;t,</HI> I <HI>an|gu&s;tior.</HI> But he goes on to reprove the exce&s;s on the other hand of being too &s;olicitous in this matter, and &s;ays admirably, <HI>Ne&s;cio an negligen|tia in hoc, aut &s;olicitudo &s;it pejor.</HI> So likewi&s;e <HI>Tully (Orator. ad Brut.) Theopompum reprehen|dunt,</HI>
<PB N="73" REF="105">
<HI>quod eas literas tanto opere fugerit, et&s;i idem magi&s;ter ejus Socrates:</HI> which la&s;t author, as Turnebus on Quintilian ob&s;erves, has hardly one Hiatus in all his works. Quintilian tells us, that Tully and Demo&s;thenes did not much ob|&s;erve this nicety, tho' Tully him&s;elf &s;ays in his Orator, <HI>Crebra i&s;ta vocum concur&s;io, quam magna ex parte vitio&s;am, fugit Demo&s;thenes.</HI> If I am not mi&s;taken, Malherbe of all the moderns has been the mo&s;t &s;crupulous in this point; and I think Menage in his ob&s;ervations upon him &s;ays, he has not one in his poems. To con|clude, I believe the Hiatus &s;hould be avoided with more care in poetry than in Oratory; and I would con&s;tantly try to prevent it, unle&s;s where the cutting it off is more prejudicial to the &s;ound than the Hiatus it&s;elf.</P>

What a va&s;t reward is here for all the ink wa&s;ted by Writers, and all the blood &s;pilt by Princes? There was in old time one Severus a Roman Emperor.

What a prodigious wa&s;te of letters has time made! what a number have here dropt off, and left the poor &s;urviving &s;even unattended!

<P>I Had &s;ent you the inclos'd<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This was a tran&s;lation of the fir&s;t book of Statius, done when the author was but fourteen years old, as appears by an adverti&s;ement before the fir&s;t edition of it in a mi&s;cellany publi&s;h'd by B.

accuracy, but to the fidelity of the tran&s;lation; which I have not had time to compare with its original. And I de&s;ire you to be the more &s;e|vere, as it is much more criminal for me to make another &s;peak non&s;en&s;e, that to do it in my own proper per&s;on. For your better help in comparing, it may be fit to tell you, that this is not an entire ver&s;ion of the fir&s;t book. There is an omi&s;&s;ion from the 168th line&mdash;<HI>Jam mur|mura &s;erpunt Plebis Agenoreae</HI>&mdash;to the 312th&mdash;<HI>Interea patriis olim vagus exul ab oris</HI>&mdash;(between the&s;e<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">The&s;e he &s;ince tran&s;lated, and they are extant in the printed ver&s;ion. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> two Statius has a de&s;cription of the coun|cil of the Gods, and a &s;peech of Jupiter; which contain a peculiar beauty and maje&s;ty, and were left out for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e the con&s;equence of this machine appears not till the &s;econd book.) The tran&s;lation goes on from thence to the words <HI>Hic vero ambobus rabiem fortuna cruentam,</HI> where there is an odd ac|count of a battle at fifty-cuffs between the two Princes on a very &s;light occa&s;ion, and at a time when, one would think, the fatigue of their jour|ney, in &s;o tempe&s;tuous a night, might have ren|der'd them very unfit for &s;uch a &s;cuffle. This I had actually tran&s;lated, but was very ill &s;ati&s;|fied with it, even in my own words, to which an author cannot but be partial enough of con|&s;cience;
<PB N="83" REF="115">
it was therefore omitted in this copy, which goes on above eighty lines farther, at the words&mdash;<HI>Hic primum lu&s;trare oculis,</HI> &amp;c.&mdash;to the end of the book.</P>
<P>You will find, I doubt not, that Statius was none of the di&s;creete&s;t Poets, tho' he was the be&s;t verfifier next Virgil: In the very begin|ning he unluckily betrays his ignorance in the rules of Poetry (which Horace had already taught the Romans) when he a&s;ks his Mu&s;e where to begin his Thebaid, and &s;eems to doubt whether it &s;hould not be <HI>ab ovo Ledaeo.</HI> When he comes to the &s;cene of his Poem, and the prize in di&s;pute between the brothers, he gives us a very mean opinion of it&mdash;<HI>Pugna e&s;t de paupere regno.</HI>&mdash;Very different from the con|duct of his ma&s;ter Virgil, who at the entrance of his Poem informs his reader of the greatne&s;s of its &s;ubject.&mdash;<HI>Tantae molis erat Romanam con|dere gentem.</HI> [Bo&s;&s;u on Epic Poetry.] There are innumerable little faults in him, among which I cannot but take notice of one in this book, where, &s;peaking of the implacable hatred of the brothers, he &s;ays, <HI>The whole world would be too &s;mall a prize to repay &s;o much impiety.</HI></P>

I know not what extraordinary flux of rhyme upon me for three days together, in which time all the ver&s;es you &s;ee added, have been written; which I tell you, that you may more freely be &s;evere upon them. 'Tis a mercy I do not a&s;&s;ault you with a number of original Sonnets and Epigrams, which our modern bards put forth in the &s;pring-time, in as great abund|ance, as trees do blo&s;&s;oms, a very few where|of ever come to the fruit, and plea&s;e no longer than ju&s;t in their birth. They make no le&s;s ha&s;te to bring their flowers of wit to the pre&s;s, than gardeners to bring their other flowers to the market, which if they can't get off their hands in the morning are &s;ure to die before night. Thus the &s;ame rea&s;on that furni&s;hes Covent-garden with tho&s;e no&s;egays you &s;o de|light in, &s;upplies the <HI>Mu&s;es Mercury</HI> and <HI>Bri|ti&s;h Apollo</HI> (not to &s;ay <HI>Jacob</HI>'s Mi&s;cellanies) with ver&s;es.

I wi&s;h you all the plea&s;ures which the &s;ea&s;on and the nymph can afford; the be&s;t company, the be&s;t coffee, and the be&s;t news you can de&s;ire: and what more to wi&s;h you than this, I do not know; unle&s;s it be a great deal of patience to read and examine the ver&s;es I &s;end you: I promi&s;e you in return a great deal of deference to your judg|ment, and an extraordinary obedience to your &s;entiments for the future, (to which, you know, I have been &s;ometimes a little refractory.) If you will plea&s;e to begin where you left off la&s;t, and mark the margins, as you have done in the pages immediately before (which you will find corrected to your &s;en&s;e &s;ince your la&s;t peru&s;al) you will extremely oblige me, and improve my tran&s;lation.

<P>THE morning after I parted from you, I found my&s;elf (as I had prophe&s;ied) all alone, in an unea&s;y Stage-coach; a doleful change from that agreeable company I enjoy'd the night before! without the lea&s;t hope of en|tertainment but from my la&s;t recour&s;e in &s;uch ca&s;es, a book. I then began to enter into ac|quaintance with your Morali&s;ts, and had ju&s;t receiv'd from them &s;ome cold con&s;olation for the inconveniencies of this life, and the uncertainty of human affairs; when I perceiv'd my vehi|cle to &s;top, and heard from the &s;ide of it the

dreadful news of a &s;ick woman preparing to en|ter it. 'Tis not ea&s;y to gue&s;s at my mortifica|tion, but being &s;o well fortify'd with philo&s;o|phy, I &s;tood re&s;ign'd with a &s;toical con&s;tancy to endure the wor&s;t of evils, a &s;ick woman. I was indeed a little comforted to find, by her voice and dre&s;s, that &s;he was young and a gen|tlewoman; but no &s;ooner was her hood re|mov'd, but I &s;aw one of the fine&s;t faces I ever beheld, and, to increa&s;e my &s;urprize, heard her &s;alute me by my name. I never had more rea|&s;on to accu&s;e nature for making me &s;hort &s;ight|ed than now, when I could not recollect I had ever &s;een tho&s;e fair eyes which knew me &s;o well, and was utterly at a lo&s;s how to addre&s;s my&s;elf; till with a great deal of &s;implicity and innocence &s;he let me know (even before I di&s;|cover'd my ignorance) that &s;he was the daugh|ter of one in our neighbourhood, lately mar|ry'd, who having been con&s;ulting her phy&s;i|cians in town, was returning into the country, to try what good air and a hu&s;band could do to recover her. My father, you mu&s;t know, has &s;ometimes recommended the &s;tudy of phy|&s;ic to me, but I never had any ambition to be a doctor till this in&s;tant.

<P>IF I were to write to you as often as I think of you, my letters would be as bad as a rent-charge; but tho' the one be but too little for your good-nature, the other would be too much for your quiet, which is one ble&s;&s;ing good-nature &s;hould indi&s;pen&s;ably receive from mankind, in return for tho&s;e many it gives. I have been inform'd of late, how much I am indebted to that quality of yours, in &s;peaking well of me in my ab&s;ence; the only thing by which you prove your&s;elf no wit nor critic: tho' indeed I have often thought, that a friend will &s;how ju&s;t as much indulgence (and no more) to my faults when I am ab&s;ent, as he does &s;everity to 'em when I am pre&s;ent. To be

very frank with you, Sir, I mu&s;t own, that where I receiv'd &s;o much civility at fir&s;t, I could hard|ly have expected &s;o much &s;incerity afterwards. But now I have only to wi&s;h, that the la&s;t were but equal to the fir&s;t, and that as you have omitted nothing to oblige me, &s;o you would omit nothing to improve me.</P>
<P>I caus'd an acquaintance of mine to enquire twice of your welfare, by whom I have been inform'd, that you have left your &s;peculative angle in the Widow's Coffee-hou&s;e, and bid|ing adieu for &s;ome time to all the Rehear&s;als, Reviews, Gazettes, &amp;c. have march'd off into Lincoln&s;hire. Thus I find you vary your life in the &s;cene at lea&s;t, tho' not in the action; for tho' life for the mo&s;t part, like an old play, be &s;till the &s;ame, yet now and then a new &s;cene may make it more entertaining.

For the gene|rality of men, a true modern life is like a true modern play, neither tragedy, comedy, nor farce, nor one, nor all of the&s;e; every actor is much better known by his having the &s;ame face, than by keeping the &s;ame character: for we change our minds as often as they can their

<P>I have dwelt the longer upon this, becau&s;e I per&s;uade my&s;elf it might be u&s;eful, at a time when we have no theatre, to divert our&s;elves at this great one.

What now can they hope, di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of their ancient &s;eats, but to &s;erve as captives to the in&s;ulting victors of the Hay-market?

That Quiet, which Cow|ley calls the <HI>Companion of Ob&s;curity,</HI> was not wanting to me, unle&s;s it was interrupted by tho&s;e fears you &s;o ju&s;tly gue&s;s I had for our friend's welfare. 'Tis extremely kind in you to tell me the news you heard of him, and you have deliver'd me from more anxiety than he imagines me capable of on his account, as I am convinced by his long &s;ilence. However, the love of &s;ome things rewards it&s;elf, as of virtue, and of Mr. Wycherley. I am &s;urprized at the danger, you tell me, he has been in, and mu&s;t agree with you, that our nation would have lo&s;t in him, as much wit and probity, as would have remain'd (for aught I know) in the re&s;t of it. My concern for his friend&s;hip will excu&s;e me (&s;ince I know you honour him &s;o much, and &s;ince you know I love him above all men)
<PB N="101" REF="135">
if I vent a part of my unea&s;ine&s;s to you, and tell you, that there has not been wanting one, to in&s;inuate malicious untruths of me to Mr. Wy|cherley, which, I fear, may have had &s;ome ef|fect upon him. If &s;o, he will have a greater puni&s;hment for his credulity than I could wi&s;h him, in that fellow's acquaintance. The lo&s;s of a faithful creature is &s;omething, tho' of ever &s;o contemptible an one; and if I were to change my dog for &s;uch a man as the afore&s;aid, I &s;hould think my dog undervalued: (who fol|lows me about as con&s;tantly here in the country, as I was us'd to do Mr. Wycherley in the town.)</P>
<P>Now I talk of my Dog, that I may not treat of a wor&s;e &s;ubject, which my &s;pleen tempts me to, I will give you &s;ome account of him; a thing not wholly unprecedented, &s;ince Mon|taigne (to whom I am but a dog in compari|&s;on) has done the &s;ame thing of his Cat. <HI>Dic mihi quid melius de&s;idio&s;us agam?</HI> You are to know then, that as 'tis likene&s;s begets affection, &s;o my favourite dog is a little one, a lean one, and none of the fine&s;t &s;hap'd. He is not much a &s;paniel in his fawning, but has (what might be worth any man's while to imitate him in) a dumb &s;urly &s;ort of kindne&s;s, that rather &s;hows it&s;elf when he thinks me ill-us'd by others, than when we walk quietly and peaceably by
<PB N="102" REF="136">
our&s;elves. If it be the chief point of friend&s;hip to comply with a friend's motions and inclina|tions, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es this in an eminent degree; he lies down when I &s;it, and walks when I walk, which is more than many good friends can pretend to, witne&s;s our walk a year ago in St. James's Park.&mdash;Hi&s;tories are more full of examples of the fidelity of dogs than of friends, but I will not in&s;i&s;t upon many of them, becau&s;e it is po&s;&s;ible &s;ome may be almo&s;t as fabulous as tho&s;e of Pylades and Ore&s;tes, &amp;c. I will only &s;ay for the honour of dogs, that the two mo&s;t antient and e&s;teemable books, &s;acred and prophane, extant (viz. the Scripture and Ho|mer) have &s;hewn a particular regard to the&s;e animals. That of Toby is the more remark|able, becau&s;e there &s;eem'd no manner of rea|&s;on to take notice of the dog, be&s;ides the great humanity of the author. Homer's account of Uly&s;&s;es's dog Argus is the mo&s;t pathetic ima|ginable, all the circum&s;tances con&s;ider'd, and an excellent proof of the old bard's good|nature. Uly&s;&s;es had left him at Ithaca when he embark'd for Troy, and found him at his re|turn after twenty years (which by the way is not unnatural, as &s;ome critics have &s;aid, &s;ince I remember the dam of my dog was twenty-two years old when &s;he dy'd: May the omen of

This re&s;pect to a dog in the mo&s;t po|lite people of the world, is very ob&s;ervable.

<P>AFTER I had recover'd from a dangerous illne&s;s which was fir&s;t contracted in town, about a fortnight after my coming hither I trou|bled you with a letter, and<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ver&s;es on Silence, in imitation of the Earl of Ro|che&s;ter's poem on Nothing; done at fourteen years old. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE> paper inclos'd, which you had been &s;o obliging as to de&s;ire a &s;ight of when la&s;t I &s;aw you, promi&s;ing me in return &s;ome tran&s;lations of yours from Ovid. Since when, I have not had a &s;yllable from your hands, &s;o that 'tis to be fear'd that tho' I have e&s;cap'd death, I have not oblivion. I &s;hould at lea&s;t have expected you to have fini&s;h'd that elegy upon me, which, you told me, you was upon the point of beginning when I was &s;ick in London; if you will but do &s;o much for me
<PB N="110" REF="144">
fir&s;t, I will give you leave to forget me after|wards; and for my own part will die at di&s;cre|tion, and at my lei&s;ure. But I fear I mu&s;t be forced, like many learned authors, to write my own epitaph, if I would be remember'd at all. Mon&s;ieur de la Fontaine's would fit me to a hair, but it is a kind of &s;acrilege (do you think it is not?) to &s;teal epitaphs. In my pre&s;ent, liv|ing dead condition, nothing would be properer than <HI>Oblitu&s;que meorum, oblivi&s;cendus &amp; illis,</HI> but that unluckily I can't forget my friends, and the civilities I received from your&s;elf, and &s;ome others. They &s;ay indeed 'tis one quality of ge|nerous minds to forget the obligations they have conferr'd, and perhaps too it may be &s;o to for|get tho&s;e on whom they conferr'd 'em: Then indeed I mu&s;t be forgotten to all intents and purpo&s;es! I am, it mu&s;t be own'd, dead in a natural capacity, according to Mr. Bicker&s;taff; dead in a poetical capacity, as a damn'd author; and dead in a civil capacity as a u&s;ele&s;s member of the Commonwealth. But reflect, dear Sir, what melancholy effects may en&s;ue, if dead men are not civil to one another! If he who has nothing to do him&s;elf, will not comfort and &s;upport another in his idlene&s;s: If tho&s;e who are to die them&s;elves, will not now and then pay the charity of vi&s;iting a tomb and a dead friend, and &s;trowing a few flowers over him:
<PB N="111" REF="145">
In the &s;hades where I am, the Inhabitants have a mutual compa&s;&s;ion for each other; being all alike Inanes; we &s;aunter to one another's habi|tations, and daily a&s;&s;i&s;t each other in doing no|thing at all. This I mention for your edifica|tion and example, that all alive as you are, you may not &s;ometimes di&s;dain&mdash;<HI>de&s;ipere in loco.</HI> Tho' you are no Papi&s;t, and have not &s;o much regard to the dead as to addre&s;s your&s;elf to them (which I plainly perceive by your &s;ilence) yet I hope you are not one of tho&s;e heterodox, who hold them to be totally in&s;en&s;ible of the good offices and kind wi&s;hes of their living friends, and to be in a dull &s;tate of &s;leep, without one dream of tho&s;e they left behind them. If you are, let this letter convince you to the contrary, which a&s;&s;ures you, I am &s;till, tho' in a &s;tate of &s;eparation, Your, &amp;c.</P>
<P>P. S. This letter of deaths, puts me in mind of poor Mr. Betterton's; over whom I would have this &s;entence of Tully for an epitaph, which will &s;erve him as well in his Moral, as his Theatrical capacity.</P>

<P>'TIS very natural for a young friend, and a young lover, to think the per&s;ons they love have nothing to do but to plea&s;e them; when perhaps they, for their parts, had twenty other engagements before. This was my ca&s;e when I wonder'd I did not hear from you; but I no &s;ooner receiv'd your &s;hort letter, but I for|got your long &s;ilence: and &s;o many fine things as you &s;aid of me could not but have wrought a cure on my own &s;ickne&s;s, if it had not been of the nature of that, which is deaf to the voice of the charmer. 'Twas impo&s;&s;ible you could have better tim'd your compliment on my phi|lo&s;ophy; it was certainly propere&s;t to commend me for it just when I mo&s;t needed it, and when I could lea&s;t be proud of it; that is, when I was in pain. 'Tis not ea&s;y to expre&s;s what an ex|altation it gave to my &s;pirits, above all the cor|dials of my doctor; and 'tis no compliment to tell you, that your compliments were &s;weeter than the &s;weete&s;t of his juleps and &s;yrups. But if you will not believe &s;o much,</P>

Neverthele&s;s I would not have you entirely lay a&s;ide the thoughts of my epitaph, any more than I do tho&s;e of the probability of my be|coming (e're long) the &s;ubject of one. For death has of late been very familiar with &s;ome of my &s;ize; I am told my Lord Lumley and Mr. Litton are gone before me; and tho' I may now, without vanity, e&s;teem my&s;elf the lea&s;t thing like a man in England, yet I can't but be &s;orry, two heroes of &s;uch a make &s;hould die inglorious in their beds; when it had been a fate more worthy our &s;ize, had they met with their from an irruption of Cranes, or other warlike animals, tho&s;e ancient enemies to our Pygmaean ance&s;tors! You of a &s;uperior &s;pecies little regard what befals us <HI>homunciones &s;e&s;qui|pedales;</HI> however, you have no rea&s;on to be &s;o unconcern'd, &s;ince all phy&s;icians agree there is no greater &s;ign of a plague among men, than a mortality among frogs. I was the other day in company with a lady, who rally'd my per|&s;on &s;o much, as to cau&s;e a total &s;ubver&s;ion of my countenance: &s;ome days after, to be re|venged on her, I pre&s;ented her, among other company, the following Rondeau on that oc|ca&s;ion, which I de&s;ire you to &s;how Sappho.</P>
<LG>
<L>You know where you did de&s;pi&s;e</L>
<L>(T'other day) my little eyes,</L>
<L><PB N="114" REF="148">
Little legs, and little thighs,</L>
<L>And &s;ome things of little &s;ize,</L>
<L>You know where.</L>
<L>You, 'tis true, have fine black eyes,</L>
<L>Taper legs, and tempting thighs,</L>
<L>Yet what more than all we prize</L>
<L>Is a thing of little &s;ize,</L>
<L>You know where.</L>
</LG>
<P>This &s;ort of writing call'd the Rondeau is what I never knew practis'd in our nation, and, I verily believe, it was not in u&s;e with the Greeks or Romans, neither Macrobius nor Hyginus taking the lea&s;t notice of it. 'Tis to be ob|&s;erv'd, that the vulgar &s;pelling and pronouncing it Round O, is a manife&s;t corruption, and by no means to be allow'd of by critics. Some may mi&s;takenly imagine that it was a &s;ort of Rondeau which the Gallick &s;oldiers &s;ung in Cae&s;ar's triumph over Gaul&mdash;<HI>Gallias Cae&s;ar &s;ub|egit,</HI> &amp;c. as it is recorded by Suetonius in Ju|lio, and &s;o derive its original from the ancient Gauls to the modern French: but this is erro|neous; the words there not being ranged ac|cording to the Laws of the Rondeau, as laid down by Clement Marot. If you will &s;ay, that the &s;ong of the &s;oldiers might be only the rude beginning of this kind of poem, and &s;o con&s;equently imperfect, neither Hein&s;ius nor I
<PB N="115" REF="149">
can be of that opinion; and &s;o I conclude, that we know nothing of the matter.</P>
<P>But, Sir, I a&s;k your pardon for all this buf|foonery, which I could not addre&s;s to any one &s;o well as to you, &s;ince I have found by experi|ence, you mo&s;t ea&s;ily forgive my impertinencies. 'Tis only to &s;how you that I am mindful of you at all times, that I write at all times; and as nothing I can &s;ay can be worth your read|ing, &s;o I may as well throw out what comes uppermo&s;t, as &s;tudy to be dull.</P>

<P>AT la&s;t I have prevail'd over a lazy humour to tran&s;cribe this elegy: I have changed the &s;ituation of &s;ome of the Latin ver&s;es, and made &s;ome interpolations, but I hope they are not ab&s;urd, and foreign to my author's &s;en&s;e and manner; but they are refer'd to your cen|&s;ure, as a debt; whom I e&s;teem no le&s;s a cri|tic than a poet: I expect to be treated with the &s;ame rigour as I have practis'd to Mr. Dryden and you.</P>

<P>I Give you thanks for the ver&s;ion you &s;ent me of Ovid's elegy. It is very much an image of that author's writing, who has an agreeable|ne&s;s that charms us without correctne&s;s, like a mi&s;tre&s;s, who&s;e faults we &s;ee, but love her with them all. You have very judiciou&s;ly alter'd his methods in &s;ome places, and I can find nothing which I dare in&s;i&s;t upon as an error: what I have written in the margins being merely
<PB N="117" REF="151">
gue&s;&s;es at a little improvement, rather than cri|tici&s;ms. I a&s;&s;ure you I do not expect you &s;hould &s;ub&s;cribe to my private notions but when you &s;hall judge them agreeable to rea&s;on and good &s;en&s;e. What I have done is not as a critic, but as a friend; I know too well how many qualities are requi&s;ite to make the one, and that I want almo&s;t all I can reckon up; but I am &s;ure I do not want inclination, nor, I hope, capacity, to be the other. Nor &s;hall I take it at all ami&s;s, that another di&s;&s;ents from my opinion: 'Tis no more than I have often done from my own; and indeed, the more a man advances in under&s;tanding, he becomes the more every day a critic upon him&s;elf, and finds &s;omething or other &s;till to blame in his former notions and opinions. I could be glad to know if you have tran&s;lated the 11th elegy of lib. ii. <HI>Ad amicam navigantem.</HI> The 8th of book iii, or the 11th of book iii, which are above all others my particular favourites, e&s;pecially the la&s;t of the&s;e.</P>
<P>As to the pa&s;&s;age of which you a&s;k my opi|nion in the &s;econd Aeneid, it is either &s;o plain as to require no &s;olution; or el&s;e (which is very probable) you &s;ee farther into it than I can. Priam would &s;ay, that <Q>&startq;Achilles (whom &s;ure|ly you only feign to be your father, &s;ince your actions are &s;o different from his) did
<PB N="118" REF="152">
not u&s;e me thus inhumanly. He blu&s;h'd at his murder of Hector, when he &s;aw my &s;or|rows for him; and re&s;tored his dead body to me to be buried.&endq;</Q> To this the an&s;wer of Pyrrhus &s;eems to be agreeable enough. <Q>&startq;Go then to the &s;hades, and tell Achilles how I degenerate from him:&endq;</Q> granting the truth of what Priam had &s;aid of the difference be|tween them. Indeed Mr. Dryden's mention|ing here what Virgil more judiciou&s;ly pa&s;&s;es in &s;ilence, the circum&s;tance of Achilles's &s;elling <HI>for money</HI> the body of Hector, &s;eems not &s;o pro|per; it in &s;ome mea&s;ure le&s;&s;ening the character of Achilles's genero&s;ity and piety, which is the very point of which Priam endeavours in this place to convince his &s;on, and to reproach him with the want of. But the truth of this cir|cum&s;tance is no way to be que&s;tion'd, being expre&s;ly taken from Homer, who repre&s;ents Achilles weeping for Priam, yet receiving the gold, Iliad xxiv. For when he gives the bo|dy, he u&s;es the&s;e words, <Q>&startq;O my friend Patro|clus! forgive me that I quit the corp&s;e of him who kill'd thee; I have great gifts in ran&s;om for it, which I will be&s;tow upon thy funeral.&endq;</Q></P>

<P>YOUR Letters are a perfect charity to a man in retirement, utterly forgotten of all his friends but you; for &s;ince Mr. Wycherley left London, I have not heard a word from him; tho' ju&s;t before, and once &s;ince, I writ to him, and tho' I know my&s;elf guilty of no of|fence but of doing &s;incerely ju&s;t what he<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Correcting his ver&s;es.

<PB N="121" REF="155">
me in ignorance of his welfare, which I am always very &s;ollicitous for, and very unea&s;y in the fear of any indi&s;po&s;ition that may befal him. In what I &s;ent you &s;ome time ago, you have not ver&s;e enough to be &s;evere upon, in re|venge for my la&s;t critici&s;m: In one point I mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t, that is to &s;ay, my di&s;like of your Paradi&s;e, in which I take no plea&s;ure; I know very well that in Greek 'tis not only us'd by Xenophon, but is a common word for any gar|den; but in Engli&s;h it bears the &s;ignification and conveys the Idea of Eden, which alone is (I think) a rea&s;on again&s;t making Ovid u&s;e it; who will be thought to talk too much like a Chri&s;tian in your ver&s;ion at lea&s;t, whatever it might have been in Latin or Greek. As for all the re&s;t of my remarks, &s;ince you do not laugh at them as at this, I can be &s;o civil as not to lay any &s;tre&s;s upon them (as, I think, I told you before) and in particular in the point of <HI>trees enjoying,</HI> you have, I mu&s;t own, fully &s;atisfied me that the expre&s;&s;ion is not only defen&s;ible, but beautiful. I &s;hall be very glad to &s;ee your tran&s;lation of the elegy, <HI>Ad Amicam navigan|tem,</HI> as &s;oon as you can; for (without a compli|ment to you) every thing you write, either in ver&s;e or pro&s;e, is welcome to me; and you may be confident, (if my opinion can be of any &s;ort of con&s;equence in any thing) that I will never

be un&s;incere, tho' I may be often mi&s;taken. To u&s;e &s;incerity with you is but paying you in your own coin, from whom I have experienced &s;o much of it; and I need not tell you, how much I really e&s;teem you, when I e&s;teem no|thing in the world &s;o much as that quality. I know, you &s;ometimes &s;ay civil things to me in your epi&s;tolary &s;tyle, but tho&s;e I am to make allowance for, as particularly when you talk of <HI>admiring;</HI> 'tis a word you are &s;o us'd to in con|ver&s;ation of Ladies, that it will creep into your di&s;cour&s;e, in &s;pite of you, even to your friends.

<P>I Am glad to find by your la&s;t letter that you write to me with the freedom of a friend, &s;etting down your thoughts as they occur, and dealing plainly with me in the matter of my own trifles, which, I a&s;&s;ure you, I never valued half &s;o much as I do that &s;incerity in you which they were the occa&s;ion of di&s;covering to me; and which while I am happy in, I may be tru&s;t|ed with that dangerous weapon, Poetry; &s;ince
<PB N="127" REF="161">
I &s;hall do nothing with it but after a&s;king and following your advice. I value &s;incerity the more, as I find by &s;ad experience, the practice of it is more dangerous; writers rarely pardon|ing the executioners of their ver&s;es, even tho' them&s;elves pronounce &s;entence upon them.&mdash;As to Mr. Philips's Pa&s;torals, I take the fir&s;t to be infinitely the be&s;t, and the &s;econd the wor&s;t; the third is for the greate&s;t part a tran&s;lation from Virgil's Daphnis. I will not fore&s;tal your judgment of the re&s;t, only ob&s;erve in that of the Nightingale the&s;e lines (&s;peaking of the mu&s;ician's playing on the harp)</P>
<LG>
<L>Now lightly &s;kimming o'er the &s;trings they pa&s;s,</L>

</LG>
<P>To which nothing can be objected, but that they are too lofty for pa&s;toral, e&s;pecially being put into the mouth of a &s;hepherd, as they are here; in the poet's own per&s;on they had been (I believe) more proper. They are more af|ter Virgil's manner than that of Theocritus, whom yet in the character of pa&s;toral he rather &s;eems to imitate. In the whole, I agree with the Tatler, that we have no better Eclogues in
<PB N="128" REF="162">
our language. There is a &s;mall copy of the &s;ame author publi&s;h'd in the Tatler N^o 12. on the Dani&s;h winter: 'Tis poetical painting, and I recommend it to your peru&s;al.</P>
<P>Dr. Garth's poem I have not &s;een, but be|lieve I &s;hall be of that critic's opinion you men|tion at <HI>Will's,</HI> who &s;wore it was good: for, tho' I am very cautious of &s;wearing after cri|tics, yet I think one may do it more &s;afely when they commend, than when they blame.</P>
<P>I agree with you in your cen&s;ure of the u&s;e of &s;ea-terms in Mr. Dryden's Virgil; not only becau&s;e Helenus was no great prophet in tho&s;e matters, but becau&s;e no terms of Art or cant words &s;uit with the maje&s;ty and dignity of &s;tyle which epic poetry requires.&mdash;<HI>Cui mens divi|nior atque os magna &s;onaturum.</HI>&mdash;The Tar|pawlin phra&s;e can plea&s;e none but &s;uch <HI>qui au|rem habent Batavam;</HI> they mu&s;t not expect <HI>auribus Atticis probari,</HI> I find by you. (I think I have brought in two phra&s;es of Martial here very dextrou&s;ly.)</P>
<P>Tho' you &s;ay you did not rightly take my meaning in the ver&s;e I quoted from Juvenal, yet I will not explain it; becau&s;e, tho' it &s;eems you are re&s;olv'd to take me for a critic, I would by no means be thought a commentator.&mdash;And for another rea&s;on too, becau&s;e I have quite forgot both the ver&s;e and the application.</P>

I gue&s;s by yours he is yet with you, and beg you to do what you may with all truth and honour, that is, a&s;&s;ure him I have ever borne all the re&s;pect and kindne&s;s imaginable to him.

I could not have thought any man &s;o very cautious and &s;u&s;picious, as not to credit his own experience of a friend. Indeed to believe no body, may be a maxim of &s;afety, but not &s;o much of hone&s;ty. There is but one way I know of conver&s;ing &s;afely, with all men, that is, not by concealing what we &s;ay or do, but by &s;aying or doing nothing that de&s;erves to be conceal'd, and I can truly boa&s;t this com|fort in my affairs with Mr. Wycherley.

<P>I have (as I think I formerly told you) a very good opinion of Mr. Row's ix^t^h book of Lucan: Indeed he amplifies too much, as well as Breboeuf, the famous French imitator.

Row here &s;ays no more, than that he look'd down on the rays of the &s;un, which Pompey might do, even tho' the body of the &s;un were above him.</P>
<P>You can't but have remarked what a jour|ney Lucan here makes Cato take for the &s;ake of his fine de&s;criptions. From Cyrene he tra|vels by land, for no better rea&s;on than this;
<Q><L>Haec eadem &s;uadebat hiems, quae clau&s;erat aequor.</L></Q>
The winter's effects on the &s;ea, it &s;eems, were more to be dreaded than all the &s;erpents, whirl|winds, &s;ands, &amp;c. by land, which immediately after he paints out in his &s;peech to the &s;oldiers: Then he fetches a compa&s;s a va&s;t way round about, to the Na&s;amones and Jupiter Ammon's temple, purely to ridicule the oracles: and La|bienus mu&s;t pardon me, if I do not believe him when he &s;ays&mdash;<HI>&s;ors obtulit, &amp; fortuna viae</HI>&mdash;ei|ther Labienus or the map, is very much mi&s;|taken here.

<P>THE &s;y&s;tem of Tycho Brahe (were it true, as it is novel) could have no room here: Lucan with the re&s;t of the Latin poets, &s;eems to follow Plato; who&s;e order of the &s;pheres is clear in Cicero, <HI>De natura Deorum, De &s;omnio Scipionis,</HI> and in Macrobius, The &s;eat of the <HI>Semidei manes</HI> is Platonic too, for <HI>Apuleius De deo Socratis</HI> a&s;&s;igns the &s;ame to the Genii, viz. the region of the Air for their intercour&s;e with gods and men; &s;o that, I fancy, Rowe mi&s;took the &s;ituation, and I can't be reconcil'd to, <HI>Look down on the &s;un's rays.</HI> I am glad you a|gree with me about the latitude he takes; and wi&s;h you had told me, if the <HI>&s;ortilegi,</HI> and <HI>fa|tidici,</HI> could licen&s;e his invective again&s;t prie&s;ts; but, I &s;uppo&s;e, you think them (with Helena) unde&s;erving of your protection.

The&s;e cele&s;tial thoughts put me in mind of the prie&s;ts you mention, who are a &s;ort of Sortilegi in one &s;en&s;e, becau&s;e in their lottery there are more blanks than prizes; the adventurers being at be&s;t in an uncertainty, whereas the &s;etters-up are &s;ure of &s;omething.

<P>IT &s;eems that my late mention of Cra&s;haw, and my quotation from him, has mov'd your curio&s;ity. I therefore &s;end you the whole Author, who has held a place among my other books of this nature for &s;ome years; in which time having read him twice or thrice, I find him one of tho&s;e who&s;e works may ju&s;t de|&s;erve reading. I take this poet to have writ like a gentleman, that is, at lei&s;ure hours, and more to keep out of idlene&s;s, than to e&s;tabli&s;h a reputation: &s;o that nothing regular or ju&s;t can be expected from him. All that regards de&s;ign, form, fable (which is the &s;oul of poetry) all that concerns exactne&s;s, or con&s;ent of parts (which is the body) will probably be wanting; only pretty conceptions, fine metaphors, glit|tering expre&s;&s;ions, and &s;omething of a neat ca&s;t of ver&s;e (which are properly the dre&s;s, gems, or loo&s;e ornaments of poetry) may be found in the&s;e ver&s;es. This is indeed the ca&s;e of mo&s;t other poetical writers of mi&s;cellanies; nor can it well be otherwi&s;e, &s;ince no man can be a true poet, who writes for diver&s;ion only. The&s;e authors &s;hould be con&s;ider'd as ver&s;ifiers and witty men, rather than as poets; and under
<PB N="140" REF="174">
this head will only fall the thoughts, the ex|pre&s;&s;ion, and the numbers. The&s;e are only the plea&s;ing part of poetry, which may be judged of at a view, and comprehended all at once. And (to expre&s;s my&s;elf like a painter) their colouring entertains the &s;ight, but the lines and life of the picture are not to be in&s;pected too narrowly.</P>
<P>This Author form'd him&s;elf upon Petrarch, or rather upon Marino. His thoughts, one may ob&s;erve, in the main, are pretty; but oftentimes far fetch'd, and too often &s;train'd and &s;tiffen'd to make them appear the greater. For men are never &s;o apt to think a thing great, as when it is odd or wonderful; and incon&s;iderate authors would rather be admir'd than under&s;tood. This ambition of &s;urprizing a reader, is the true na|tural cau&s;e of all fu&s;tian, or bomba&s;t in poetry. To confirm what I have &s;aid, you need but look into his fir&s;t Poem of the Weeper, where the 2d, 4th, 6th, 14th, 21&s;t &s;tanza's are as &s;ublime|ly dull, as the 7th, 8th, 9th, 16th, 17th, 20th and 23d &s;tanza's of the &s;ame copy, are &s;oft and plea&s;ing: and if the&s;e la&s;t want any thing, it is an ea&s;ier and more unaffected expre&s;&s;ion. The remaining thoughts in that poem might have been &s;pared, being either but repetitions, or ve|ry trivial and mean. And by this example in the fir&s;t one may gue&s;s at all the re&s;t; to be
<PB N="141" REF="175">
like this, a mixture of tender gentle thoughts and &s;uitable expre&s;&s;ions, of forced and inextrica|ble conceits, and of needle&s;s fillers-up to the re&s;t. From all which it is plain, this author writ fa&s;t, and &s;et down what came uppermo&s;t. A reader may &s;kim off the froth, and u&s;e the clear underneath; but if he goes too deep will meet with a mouthful of dregs; either the top or bottom of him are good for little, but what he did in his own, natural, middle-way, is be&s;t.</P>
<P>To &s;peak of his numbers, is a little difficult, they are &s;o various and irregular, and mo&s;tly Pindaric; 'tis evident his heroic ver&s;e (the be&s;t example of which is his Mu&s;ic's Duel) is care|le&s;ly made up; but one may imagine from what it now is, that, had he taken more care, it had been mu&s;ical and plea&s;ing enough, not extreme|ly maje&s;tic, but &s;weet: and the time con&s;ider'd of his writing, he was (even as uncorrect as he is) none of the wor&s;t ver&s;ificators.</P>
<P>I will ju&s;t ob&s;erve, that the be&s;t pieces of this author are, a Paraphra&s;e on P&s;al. xxiii. On Le&s;|&s;ius, Epitaph on Mr. A&s;hton, Wi&s;hes to his &s;up|pos'd mi&s;tre&s;s, and the <HI>Dies Irae.</HI></P>

I know there are prudes in friend&s;hip, who expect di&s;tance, awe, and ado|ration, but I know you are not of them; and I for my part am no Idol-wor&s;hipper, tho' a Pa|pi&s;t. If I were to addre&s;s Jupiter him&s;elf in a heathen way, I fancy I &s;hould be apt to take hold of his knee in a familiar manner, if not of his beard like Diony&s;ius; I was ju&s;t going to &s;ay, of his buttons; but I think Jupiter wore none (however I won't be po&s;itive to &s;o nice a critic as you, but his robe might be &s;ubnected with a Fibula.)

There is a difference too betwixt laugh|ing <HI>about</HI> a thing and laughing <HI>at</HI> a thing: one may find the inferior man (to make a kind of ca&s;ui&s;tical di&s;tinction) provoked to folly at the &s;ight or ob&s;ervation of &s;ome <HI>circum&s;tance of a thing,</HI> when the <HI>thing it&s;elf</HI> appears &s;olemn and augu&s;t to the &s;uperior man, that is, our judg|ment and rea&s;on. Let an Amba&s;&s;ador &s;peak the be&s;t &s;en&s;e in the world, and deport him&s;elf in the mo&s;t graceful manner before a Prince, yet if the tail of his &s;hirt happen (as I have known it happen to a very wi&s;e man) to hang out behind, more people &s;hall laugh at that than at|tend to the other; 'till they recollect them&s;elves, and then they will not have a jot the le&s;s re&s;pect for the mini&s;ter. I mu&s;t confe&s;s the iniquity of my countenance before you; &s;everal mu&s;cles of my face &s;ometimes take an impertinent li|berty with my judgment, but then my judg|ment &s;oon ri&s;es, and &s;ets all right again about my mouth: and I find I value no man &s;o much, as him in who&s;e &s;ight I have been playing the fool.

<P>I Received the entertainment of your letter the day after I had &s;ent you one of mine, and I am but this morning returned hither. The news you tell me of the many difficulties you found in your return from Bath, gives me &s;uch a kind of plea&s;ure as we u&s;ually take in accom|panying our friends in their mix'd adventures; for, methinks, I &s;ee you labouring thro' all your inconveniencies of the rough roads, the hard &s;addle, the trotting hor&s;e, and what not? What an agreeable &s;urprize would it have been to me,
<PB N="147" REF="181">
to have met you by pure accident, (which I was within an ace of doing) and to have carried you off triumphantly, &s;et you on an ea&s;ier pad, and relieved the wandring knight with a night's lodg|ing and rural repa&s;t, at our ca&s;tle in the fore&s;t? But the&s;e are only the plea&s;ing imaginations of a di&s;appointed lover, who mu&s;t &s;uffer in a me|lancholy ab&s;ence yet the&s;e two months. In the mean time, I take up with the Mu&s;es for want of your better company; the Mu&s;es, <HI>quae nobi&s;|cum pernoctant, peregrinantur, ru&s;ticantur.</HI> Tho&s;e a&euml;rial ladies ju&s;t di&s;cover enough to me of their beauties to urge my pur&s;uit, and draw me on in a wandering maze of thought, &s;till in hopes (and only in hopes) of attaining tho&s;e favours from them, which they confer on their more happy admirers. We gra&s;p &s;ome more beauti|ful idea in our own brain, than our endeavours to expre&s;s it can &s;et to the view of others; and &s;till do but labour to fall &s;hort of our fir&s;t ima|gination.

<P>MR. Wycherley has, I believe, &s;ent you two or three letters of invitation; but you, like the fair, will be long &s;ollicited before you yield, to make the favour the more acceptable to the lover. He is much yours by his talk; for that unbounded genius which has rang'd at

Oh happy fa|vourite of the Mu&s;es! how <HI>pernoctare,</HI> all night long with them? but alas! you do but toy, but &s;kirmi&s;h with them, and decline a clo&s;e en|gagement. Leave Elegy and tran&s;lation to the inferior cla&s;s, on whom the Mu&s;es only glance now and then like our winter-&s;un, and then leave them in the dark. Think on the dignity of Tragedy, which is of the greater poetry, as Dennis &s;ays, and foil him at his other weapon, as you have done in Critici&s;m. Every one wonders that a genius like yours will not &s;up|port the &s;inking Drama; and Mr. Wilks (tho', I think, his talent is Comedy) has expre&s;s'd a fu|rious ambition to &s;well in your bu&s;kins.

<P>IF I have not writ to you &s;o &s;oon as I ought, let my writing now atone for the delay; as it will infallibly do, when you know what a &s;a|crifice I make you at this time, and that every moment my eyes are employ'd upon this pa|per, they are taken off from two of the fine&s;t faces in the univer&s;e. But indeed 'tis &s;ome con|&s;olation to me to reflect, that while I but write this period, I e&s;cape &s;ome hundred fatal darts from tho&s;e unerring eyes, and about a thou|&s;and deaths or better. Now you, that delight in dying, would not once have dreamt of an ab&s;ent friend in the&s;e circum&s;tances; you that are &s;o nice an admirer of beauty, or (as a Critic would &s;ay after Terence) <HI>&s;o elegant a &s;pectator of forms;</HI> you mu&s;t have a &s;ober di&s;h of coffee, and a &s;olitary candle at your &s;ide, to write an epi&s;tle lucubratory to your friend; whereas I can do it as well with two pair of radiant lights, that out&s;hine the golden god of day and &s;ilver godde&s;s of night, and all the refulgent eyes of

Indeed, in|deed, my friend, you could never have found &s;o improper a time to tempt me with intere&s;t or ambition: let me but have the reputation of the&s;e in my keeping, and as for my own, let the devil, or let Dennis, take it for ever. How gladly would I give all I am worth, that is to &s;ay, my Pa&s;torals, for one of them, and my E&s;|&s;ay for the other? I would lay out all my Poe|try in Love; an Original for a Lady, and a Tran&s;|lation for a Waiting-maid! Alas! what have I to do with Jane Gray, as long as Mi&s;s Molly, Mi&s;s Betty, or Mi&s;s Patty are in this world? Shall I write of beauties murdered long ago, when there are tho&s;e at this in&s;tant that murder me?

You are but too good a Painter already; and no picture of Raphael's was ever &s;o beautiful, as that which you have form'd in a certain heart of my acquaintance. Indeed it was but ju&s;t that the fine&s;t lines in nature &s;hould be drawn upon the

I may boldly &s;ay of it, that you will not find its fel|low in all the parts of the body in this book. But I mu&s;t complain to you of my hand, which is an arrant traitor to my heart; for having been copying your picture from thence and from Kneller the&s;e three days, it has done all po&s;&s;i|ble injury to the fine&s;t face that ever was made, and to the livelie&s;t image that ever was drawn.

morning I waked, very angry at your phantom for leaving me &s;o abruptly.&mdash;I know you de|light in my mortification. I dined with an old Beauty; &s;he appear'd at the table like a Death's head enamell'd. The Egyptians, you know, had &s;uch things at their entertainments; but do you think they painted and patched them? However, the la&s;t of the&s;e objections was &s;oon remov'd; for the lady had &s;o violent an appe|tite for a &s;almon, that &s;he quickly eat all the patches off her face. She divided the fi&s;h into three parts; not equal, God knows; for &s;he helped Gay to the head, me to the middle, and making the re&s;t much the large&s;t part took it her&s;elf, and cried very naively, I'll be content with my own tail.</P>
<P>My &s;upper was as &s;ingular as my dinner. It was with a great Poet and Ode-maker (that is, a great poet out of his wits, or out of his way.) He came to me very hungry; not for want of a dinner (for that I &s;hould make no je&s;t of) but, having forgot to dine. He fell mo&s;t furi|ou&s;ly on the broil'd relics of a &s;houlder of mut|ton, commonly call'd a blade-bone: he pro|fe&s;&s;ed he never ta&s;ted &s;o exqui&s;ite a thing! beg|ged me to tell him what joint it was; wondered he had never heard the name of this joint, or &s;een it at other tables; and de&s;ir'd to know how he might direct his butcher to cut out the &s;ame

<P>YOU &s;hould have my Day too, Sir, but in|deed I &s;lept it out, and &s;o I'll give you all that was left, my la&s;t Night's entertainment. You know the company. I went in late, in order to be better received; but unluckily came in, as Deuce-ace was flinging (Lord H. would &s;ay I came in the Nick.) The Lady colour'd, and the men took the name of the Lord in vain: No body &s;poke to me, and I &s;at down di&s;appointed; then affecting a carele&s;s air, gap'd, and cried &s;even or eight times, <HI>D'ye win or lo&s;e?</HI> I could &s;afely &s;ay at that moment I had no temptation to any one of the &s;even, lively &s;ins; and in the innocent way I was, happy had it been for me if I had died!

<P>YOU are to under&s;tand, Madam, that my pa&s;&s;ion for your fair &s;elf and your &s;i&s;ter, has been divided with the mo&s;t wonderful re|gularity in the world. Even from my infancy I have been in love with one after the other of you, week by week, and my journey to Bath fell out in the three hundred &s;eventy-&s;ixth week of the reign of my &s;overeign lady Sylvia. At the pre&s;ent writing hereof it is the three hun|dred eighty-ninth week of the reign of your mo&s;t &s;erene maje&s;ty, in who&s;e &s;ervice I was li&s;ted &s;ome weeks before I beheld your &s;i&s;ter. This Information will account for my writing to either of you hereafter, as either &s;hall hap|pen to be Queen-regent at that time.</P>
<P>Pray tell your &s;i&s;ter, all the good qualities and virtuous inclinations &s;he has, never gave me &s;o much plea&s;ure in her conver&s;ation, as that one vice of her ob&s;tinacy will give me mortification this month. Ratcliffe commands her to the Bath, and &s;he refu&s;es! indeed if I were in Berk&s;hire I &s;hould honour her for this ob&s;tinacy, and magnify her no le&s;s for di&s;obe|dience than we do the Barcelonians. But peo|ple change with the change of places (as we
<PB N="165" REF="199">
&s;ee of late) and virtues become vices when they cea&s;e to be for one's intere&s;t, with me, as with others.</P>
<P>Yet let me tell her, &s;he will never look &s;o finely while &s;he is upon earth, as &s;he would here in the water. It is not here as in mo&s;t other in&s;tances, for tho&s;e ladies that would plea&s;e extremely, mu&s;t go out of their own element. She does not make half &s;o good a figure on hor&s;eback as Chri&s;tina Queen of Swe|den; but were &s;he once &s;een in the Bath, no man would part with her for the be&s;t meirmaid in Chri&s;tendom. You know I have &s;een you often, I perfectly know how you look in black and in white, I have experienced the utmo&s;t you can do in colours; but all your movements, all your graceful &s;teps, de&s;erve not half the glory you might here attain, of a moving and ea&s;y behaviour in buckram: Something be|tween &s;wimming and walking, free enough, and more mode&s;tly-half-naked than you can appear any where el&s;e. You have conquer'd enough already by land; &s;how your ambition, and vanqui&s;h al&s;o by water. The buckram I mention is a dre&s;s particularly u&s;eful at this time, when, we are told, they are bringing over the fa&s;hion of German ruffs: You ought to u&s;e your&s;elves to &s;ome degrees of &s;tiffne&s;s be|forehand; and when our ladies chins have been

He had heard it was an excel|lent cure for love, to ki&s;s the Aunt of the per|&s;on beloved, who is generally of years and ex|perience enough to damp the fierce&s;t flame: he try'd this cour&s;e in his pa&s;&s;ion, and ki&s;&s;ed Mrs. E&mdash;at Mr. D&mdash;'s, but, he &s;ays, it will not do, and that he loves you as much as ever.</P>

What rai&s;es the&s;e de&s;ires in me, is an acquaintance I am beginning with my lady Sandwich, who has all the &s;pirit of the la&s;t age, and all the gay ex|perience of a plea&s;urable life. It were as &s;can|dalous an omi&s;&s;ion to come to the Bath and not to &s;ee my lady Sandwich, as it had formerly been to have travelled to Rome without vi&s;iting the Queen of Sweden. She is, in a word, the be&s;t thing this country has to boa&s;t of; and as &s;he has been all that a woman of &s;pirit could be, &s;o &s;he &s;till continues that ea&s;y and independent creature that a &s;en&s;ible woman always will be.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you a truth, which is not, however, much to my credit. I never thought &s;o much of your&s;elf and your &s;i&s;ter, as &s;ince I have been four&s;core miles di&s;tance from you. In the Fo|re&s;t I look'd upon you as good neighbours, at London as pretty kind of women, but here as divinities, angels, godde&s;&s;es, or what you will.

<P>I Return'd home as &s;low and as contemplative after I had parted from you, as my Lord* retired from the Court and glory to his Country &s;eat and wife, a week ago. I found here a di&s;|mal de&s;ponding letter from the &s;on of another great courtier who expects the &s;ame fate, and

who tells me the great ones of the earth will now take it very kindly of the mean ones, if they will favour them with a vi&s;it by day-light. With what joy would they lay down all their &s;chemes of glory, did they but know you have the genero&s;ity to drink their healths once a day, as &s;oon as they are fallen? Thus the unhappy, by the &s;ole merit of their misfortunes, become the care of Heaven and you.

<P>THE more I examine my own mind, the more romantic I find my&s;elf. Methinks it is a noble &s;pirit of contradiction to Fate and Fortune, not to give up tho&s;e that are &s;natched from us; but to follow them the more, the farther they are remov'd from the &s;en&s;e of it. Sure, Flattery never travelled &s;o far as three thou&s;and miles; it is now only for Truth, which overtakes all things, to reach you at this di|&s;tance. 'Tis a generous piece of Popery, that pur&s;ues even tho&s;e who are to be eternally ab|&s;ent, into another world; whether you think it right or wrong, you'll own the very extrava|gance a &s;ort of piety. I can't be &s;atisfied with &s;trowing flowers over you, and barely honour|ing you as a thing lo&s;t: but mu&s;t con&s;ider you as a glorious tho' remote being, and be &s;ending
<PB N="171" REF="205">
addre&s;&s;es after you. You have carried away &s;o much of me, that what remains is daily lan|gui&s;hing and dying over my acquaintance here, and, I believe, in three or four months more I &s;hall think <HI>Aurat Bazar</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">At Con&s;tantinople.</NOTE> as good a place as <HI>Covent Garden.</HI> You may imagine this is rail|lery, but I am really &s;o far gone as to take plea|&s;ure in reveries of this kind. Let them &s;ay I am romantic, &s;o is every one &s;aid to be, that either admires a fine thing or does one. On my con&s;cience, as the world goes, 'tis hardly worth any body's while to do one for the honour of it: Glory, the only pay of generous actions, is now as ill paid as other ju&s;t debts; and neither Mrs. Macfarland for immolating her lover, not you, for con&s;tancy to your lord, mu&s;t ever hope to be compared to Lucretia or Portia.</P>
<P>I write this in &s;ome anger; for having, &s;ince you went, frequented tho&s;e people mo&s;t, who &s;eemed mo&s;t in your favour, I heard nothing that concerned you talked of &s;o often, as that you went away in a black full-bottom'd wig; which I did but a&s;&s;ert to be a bob, and was an&s;wered, <HI>Love is blind.</HI> I am per&s;uaded your wig had never &s;uffered this critici&s;m, but on the &s;core of your head, and the two eyes that are in it.</P>
<P><PB N="172" REF="206">
Pray when you write to me, talk of your&s;elf; there is nothing I &s;o much de&s;ire to hear of: talk a great deal of your&s;elf; that &s;he who I al|ways thought talked be&s;t, may &s;peak upon the be&s;t &s;ubject. The &s;hrines and reliques you tell me of, no way engage my curio&s;ity; I had ten times rather go on pilgrimage to &s;ee one &s;uch face as yours, than both St. John Bapti&s;t's heads. I wi&s;h (&s;ince you are grown &s;o covetous of golden things) you had not only all the fine &s;tatues you talk of, but even the golden image which Nebuchadnezzar &s;et up, provided you were to travel no farther than you could carry it.</P>
<P>The court of Vienna is very edifying. The ladies, with re&s;pect to their hu&s;bands, &s;eem to under&s;tand that text literally, that commands to <HI>hear one another's burthens:</HI> but, I fancy, many a man there is like <HI>I&s;&s;achar,</HI> an <HI>a&s;s</HI> between <HI>two burthens.</HI> I &s;hall look upon you no more as a Chri&s;tian, when you pa&s;s from that charitable court to the land of jealou&s;y. I expect to hear an exact account how, and at what places, you leave one of the thirty-nine articles after another, as you approach to the lands of infidelity. Pray how far are you got already? amid&s;t the pomp of a high ma&s;s, and the ravi&s;hing trills of a Sunday opera, what did you think of the doc|trine and di&s;cipline of the church of England? had you from your heart a reverence for Stern|hold

How did your Chri&s;tian virtues hold out in &s;o long a voyage? you have, it &s;eems (without pa&s;&s;ing the bounds of Chri&s;t|endom) out-travelled the &s;in of fornication: in a little time you'll look upon &s;ome others with more patience, than the ladies here are capable of. I reckon, you'll time it &s;o well as to make your religion la&s;t to the verge of Chri&s;tendom, that you may di&s;charge your Chaplain (as hu|manity requires) in a place where he may find &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>I doubt not but I &s;hall be told (when I come to follow you through tho&s;e countries) in how pretty a manner you accommodated your&s;elf to the cu&s;toms of the true Mu&s;lemen. They will tell me at what town you practi&s;ed to &s;it on the Sopha, at what village you learned to fold a Turbant, where you was bathed and anointed, and where you parted with your black full-bot|tom. How happy mu&s;t it be for a gay young woman, to live in a country where it is a part of religious wor&s;hip to be <HI>giddy-headed?</HI> I &s;hall hear at Belgrade how the good Ba&s;haw received you with tears of joy, how he was charmed with your agreeable manner of pronouncing the words <HI>Allah</HI> and <HI>Muhamed;</HI> and how earn|e&s;tly you joined with him in exhorting your friend to embrace that religion.

I am growing fit, I hope, for a better world, of which the light of the &s;un is but a &s;hadow: for I doubt not but God's works here, are what come neare&s;t to his works there; and that a true reli&s;h of the beauties of nature is the mo&s;t ea&s;y preparation and gentle&s;t tran&s;ition to an enjoyment of tho&s;e of heaven: as on the con|trary, a true town-life of hurry, confu&s;ion,

The &s;epa|ration of my &s;oul and body is what I could think of with le&s;s pain; for I am very &s;ure he that made it will take care of it, and in what|ever &s;tate he plea&s;es it &s;hall be, that &s;tate mu&s;t be right: But I cannot think without tears of being &s;eparated from my friends, when their condition is &s;o doubtful, that they may want even &s;uch a&s;&s;i&s;tance as mine. Sure, it is more merciful to take from us after death all memory of what we lov'd or pur&s;ued here: for el&s;e what a torment would it be to a &s;pirit, &s;till to love tho&s;e creatures it is quite divided from? Unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e, that in a more exalted life, all that we e&s;teemed in this imperfect &s;tate will affect us no more, than what we lov'd in our infancy concerns us now.</P>

<P>THIS is a day of wi&s;hes for you, and I hope you have long known, there is not one good one which I do not form in your be|half. Every year that pa&s;&s;es, I wi&s;h &s;ome things more for my friends, and &s;ome things le&s;s for my&s;elf. Yet were I to tell you what I wi&s;h for you in particular, it would be only to repeat in pro&s;e, what I told you la&s;t year in rhyme (&s;o &s;incere is my poetry:) I can only add, that as I then wi&s;h'd you a friend <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">To Mrs.&mdash;on her Birth-day.

<P>Ab&s;ence is a &s;hort kind of death; and in ei|ther, one can only wi&s;h, that the friends we are &s;eparated from, may be happy with tho&s;e that are left them. I am therefore very &s;olli|citous that you may pa&s;s much agreeable time together: I am &s;orry to &s;ay I envy you no other companion; tho' I hope you have o|thers that you like; and I am always pleas'd in that hope, when it is not attended with any fears on your own account.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="215">
I was troubled to leave you both, ju&s;t as I fancy'd we &s;hould begin to live together in the country. 'Twas a little like dying the mo|ment one had got all one de&s;ir'd in this world. Yet I go away with one generous &s;ort of &s;atis|faction, that what I part with, you are to in|herit.</P>
<P>I know you would both be pleas'd to hear &s;ome certain news of a friend departed; to have the adventures of his pa&s;&s;age, and the new re|gions thro' which he travell'd, de&s;cribed; and, upon the whole, to know, that he is as happy where he now is, as while he liv'd among you. But indeed I (like many a poor unprepar'd &s;oul) have &s;een nothing I like &s;o well as what I left: No &s;cenes of Paradi&s;e, no happy bowers, equal to tho&s;e on the banks of the Thames. Where|ever I wander, one reflection &s;trikes me: I wi&s;h you were as free as I; or at lea&s;t had a tye as tender, and as rea&s;onable as mine, to a relation that as well de&s;erved your con&s;tant thought, and to whom you would be always pull'd back (in &s;uch a manner as I am) by the heart-&s;tring.

<P>YOU can't be &s;urpriz'd to find him a dull corre&s;pondent whom you have known &s;o long for a dull companion. And tho' I am pretty &s;en&s;ible, that, if I have any wit, I may as well write to &s;how it, as not; yet I'll con|tent my&s;elf with giving you as plain a hi&s;tory of my pilgrimage, as Purchas him&s;elf, or as John Bunyan could do of his <HI>walking through the wild|erne&s;s of this world,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t then I went by water to Hampton-Court, unattended by all but my own virtues; which were not of &s;o mode&s;t a nature as to keep them&s;elves, or me, conceal'd: For I met the Prince with all his ladies on hor&s;eback, coming from hunting. Mrs. B* and Mrs. L* took me into protection (contrary to the laws again&s;t harbouring Papi&s;ts) and gave me a dinner, with &s;omething I liked better, an opportunity of con|ver&s;ation with Mrs. H*. We all agreed that the life of a Maid of honour was of all things
<PB N="183" REF="217">
the mo&s;t mi&s;erable: and wi&s;h'd that every wo|man who envy'd it, had a &s;pecimen of it. To eat We&s;tphalia-ham in a morning, ride over hedges and ditches on borrowed hacks, come home in the heat of the day with a fever, and (what is wor&s;e a hundred times) with a red mark in the forehead from an unea&s;y hat; all this may qualify them to make excellent wives for fox-hunters, and bear abundance of ruddy complexion'd children. As &s;oon as they can wipe off the &s;weat of the day, they mu&s;t &s;im|per an hour and catch cold, in the Prince&s;s's apartment: from thence (as Shake&s;pear has it) to <HI>dinner, with what appetite they may</HI>&mdash;and af|ter that, till midnight, walk, work, or think, which they plea&s;e. I can ea&s;ily believe, no lone|hou&s;e in Wales, with a mountain and a rookery, is more contemplative than this Court; and as a proof of it I need only tell you, Mrs. L* walk'd with me three or four hours by moonlight, and we met no creature of any quality but the King, who gave audience to the vice-chamber|lain, all alone, under the garden-wall.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I heard of no ball, a&s;&s;embly, ba&s;|&s;et-table, or any place where two or three were gathered together, except Madam Kilman&s;egg's, to which I had the honour to be invited, and the grace to &s;tay away.</P>

I was heartily tired, and po&s;ted to&mdash;park: there we had an excellent di&s;cour&s;e of quackery; Dr. S* was mentioned with honour.

<P>I arrived in the fore&s;t by Tue&s;day noon, hav|ing fled from the face (I wi&s;h I could &s;ay the horned face) of Mo&s;es, who dined in the mid|way thither.

<P>NOthing could have more of that melan|choly which once u&s;ed to plea&s;e me, than my la&s;t day's journey; for after having pa&s;s'd through my favourite woods in the fore&s;t, with a thou&s;and reveries of pa&s;t plea&s;ures, I rid over hanging hills, who&s;e tops were edged with groves, and who&s;e feet water'd with winding rivers, li&s;tening to the falls of cataracts below, and the murmuring of the winds above: The gloomy verdure of Stonor &s;ucceeded to the&s;e; and then the &s;hades of the evening overtook me. The moon ro&s;e in the cleare&s;t &s;ky I ever &s;aw, by who&s;e &s;olemn light I paced on &s;lowly, without company, or any interruption to the range of my thoughts. About a mile before I reach'd Oxford, all the bells toll'd in different notes; the clocks of every college an&s;wered one another, and &s;ounded forth (&s;ome in a deeper, &s;ome a &s;ofter tone) that it was eleven at night. All this was no ill preparation to the life I have led &s;ince, among tho&s;e old walls, venerable galleries, &s;tone portico's, &s;tudious walks, and &s;olitary &s;cenes of the Univer&s;ity. I wanted nothing but a black gown and a &s;alary, to be as mere a bookworm as any there. I conform'd my&s;elf to the college hours, was roll'd up in
<PB N="186" REF="220">
books, lay in one of the mo&s;t ancient, du&s;ky parts of the Univer&s;ity, and was as dead to the world as any hermit of the de&s;art. If any thing was alive or awake in me, it was a little va|nity, &s;uch as even tho&s;e good men us'd to en|tertain, when the monks <HI>of their own order</HI> ex|toll'd their piety and ab&s;traction. For I found my&s;elf receiv'd with a &s;ort of re&s;pect, which this idle part of mankind, the Learned, pay to their own &s;pecies; who are as con&s;iderable here, as the bu&s;y, the gay, and the ambitious are in your world.</P>
<P>Indeed I was treated in &s;uch a manner, that I could not but &s;ometimes a&s;k my&s;elf in my mind, what college I was founder of, or what library I had built? Methinks, I do very ill to return to the world again, to leave the only place where I make a figure, and, from &s;eeing my&s;elf &s;eated with dignity on the mo&s;t con&s;pi|cuous &s;helves of a library, put my&s;elf into the ab|ject po&s;ture of lying at a lady's feet in St. James's &s;quare.</P>
<P>I will not deny, but that, like Alexander, in the mid&s;t of my glory I am wounded, and find my&s;elf a mere man. To tell you from whence the dart comes, is to no purpo&s;e, &s;ince neither of you will take the tender care to draw it out of my heart, and &s;uck the poi&s;on with your lips.</P>

I told him, 'twas what he could never have thought of, if it had not been his misfortune to be blind; and what I never could think of, while I had eyes to &s;ee both her and my&s;elf.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not conclude without telling you, that I will do the utmo&s;t in the affair you de|&s;ire.

<P>I Can &s;ay little to recommend the letters I &s;hall write to you, but that they will be the mo&s;t impartial repre&s;entations of a free heart, and the true&s;t copies you ever &s;aw, tho' of a very mean original. Not a feature will be &s;oftened, or any advantageous light employed to make the ugly thing a little le&s;s hideous; but
<PB N="195" REF="229">
you &s;hall find it in all re&s;pects, mo&s;t horribly like. You will do me an inju&s;tice if you look upon any thing I &s;hall &s;ay from this in&s;tant, as a com|pliment, either to you or to my&s;elf: Whatever I write will be the real thought of that hour; and I know you'll no more expect it of me to per|&s;evere till death, in every &s;entiment or notion I now &s;et down, than you would imagine a man's face &s;hould never change when once his picture was drawn.</P>
<P>The freedom I &s;hall u&s;e in this manner of <HI>thinking aloud,</HI> may indeed prove me a fool; but it will prove me one of the be&s;t &s;ort of fools, the hone&s;t ones. And &s;ince what folly we have, will infallibly buoy up at one time or other in &s;pite of all our art to keep it down; methinks, 'tis almo&s;t fooli&s;h to take any pains to conceal it at all, and almo&s;t knavi&s;h to do it from tho&s;e that are our friends. If Momus's project had taken, of having windows in our brea&s;ts, I &s;hould be for carrying it further, and making tho&s;e windows, ca&s;ements; that while a man &s;howed his heart to all the world, he might do &s;omething more for his friends; even give it them, and tru&s;t it to their handling. I think I love you as well as King Herod did Herodias (tho' I never had &s;o much as one dance with you) and would as freely give you my heart in a di&s;h, as he did another's head.
<PB N="196" REF="230">
But &s;ince Jupiter will not have it &s;o, I mu&s;t be content to &s;hew my ta&s;te in life, as I do my ta&s;te in painting, by loving to have as little dra|pery as po&s;&s;ible. Not that I think every body naked altogether &s;o fine a &s;ight, as your&s;elf and a few more would be, but becau&s;e 'tis good to u&s;e people to what they mu&s;t be acquainted with; and there will certainly come &s;ome day of judgment or other, to uncover every &s;oul of us. We &s;hall then &s;ee that the Prudes of this world owed all their fine figure only to their being &s;traiter-laced than the re&s;t; and that they are naturally as arrant &s;quabs as tho&s;e that went more loo&s;e, nay as tho&s;e that never girded their loins at all.&mdash;But a particular rea&s;on that may engage you to write your thoughts the more freely to me, is, that I am confident no one knows you better; for I find, when others ex|pre&s;s their thoughts of you, they fall very &s;hort of mine, and, I know, at the &s;ame time, theirs are &s;uch as you would think &s;ufficiently in your favour.</P>
<P>You may ea&s;ily imagine how de&s;irous I mu&s;t be of a corre&s;pondence with a per&s;on, who had taught me long ago that it was as po&s;&s;ible to e&s;teem at fir&s;t &s;ight, as to love: and who has &s;ince ruin'd me for all the conver&s;ation of one &s;ex, and almo&s;t all the friend&s;hip of the other. I am but too &s;en&s;ible thro' your means, that the
<PB N="197" REF="231">
company of men wants a certain &s;oftne&s;s to re|commend it, and that of women wants every thing el&s;e. How often have I been quietly go|ing to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that tranquillity and in|dolence I had &s;o long found in the Country; when one evening of your conver&s;ation has &s;poil'd me for a Solitaire! Books have lo&s;t their effect upon me, and I was convinced &s;ince I &s;aw you, that there is one alive wi&s;er than all the &s;ages. A plague of female wi&s;dom! it makes a man ten times more unea&s;y than his own. What is very &s;trange, Virtue her&s;elf (when you have the dre&s;&s;ing her) is too amiable for one's repo&s;e. You might have done a world of good in your time, if you had allowed half the fine gentlemen who have &s;een you, to have conver&s;ed with you; they would have been &s;trangely bit, while they thought only to fall in love with a fair lady, and you had bewitch'd them with Rea&s;on and Virtue (two beauties that the very fops pretend to no acquaintance with.)</P>
<P>The unhappy di&s;tance at which we corre|&s;pond, removes a great many of tho&s;e re&s;trictions and punctilious decorums, that oftentimes in nearer conver&s;ation prejudice truth, to &s;ave good-breeding. I may now hear of my faults, and you of your good qualities, without a blu&s;h; we conver&s;e upon &s;uch unfortunate ge|nerous
<PB N="198" REF="232">
terms, as exclude the regards of fear, &s;hame, or de&s;ign, in either of us. And, me|thinks it would be as paltry a part, to impo&s;e (even in a &s;ingle thought) upon each other in this &s;tate of &s;eparation, as for &s;pirits of a differ|ent &s;phere, who have &s;o little intercour&s;e with us, to employ that little (as &s;ome would make us think they do) in putting tricks and delu&s;ions upon poor mortals.</P>
<P>Let me begin then, Madam, by a&s;king you a que&s;tion, that may enable me to judge better of my own conduct than mo&s;t in&s;tances of my life. In what manner did I behave in the la&s;t hour I &s;aw you? What degree of concern did I di&s;cover when I felt a misfortune, which, I hope, you will never feel, that of parting from what one mo&s;t e&s;teems? for if my parting looked but like that of your common acquaintance, I am the greate&s;t of all the hypocrites that ever de|cency made.</P>
<P>I never &s;ince pa&s;s by your hou&s;e but with the &s;ame &s;ort of melancholy that we feel upon &s;ee|ing the tomb of a friend, which only &s;erves to put us in mind of what we have lo&s;t. I reflect upon the circum&s;tances of your departure, which I was there a witne&s;s of (your beha|viour in what I may call your la&s;t moments) and I indulge a gloomy kind of plea&s;ure in thinking that tho&s;e la&s;t moments were given to
<PB N="199" REF="233">
me. I would fain imagine this was not acci|dental, but proceeded from a penetration, which, I know, you have, in finding out the truth of people's &s;entiments; and that you were willing, the la&s;t man that <HI>would have</HI> parted from you, &s;hould be the la&s;t that <HI>did.</HI> I really looked upon you ju&s;t as the friends of Curtius might have done upon that Hero, at the in&s;tant when he was devoting him&s;elf to glory, and running to be lo&s;t out of genero&s;ity: I was obliged to admire your re&s;olution, in as great a degree as I deplored it; and had only to wi&s;h, that Heaven would reward &s;o much virtue as was to be taken from us, with all the felicities it could en|joy el&s;ewhere!</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<P>I Can never have too many of your letters. I am angry at every &s;crap of paper lo&s;t, and tho' it is but an odd compliment to compare a fine lady to a Sibyl, your leaves, methinks, like hers, are too good to be committed to the winds; tho' I have no other way of receiving them but by tho&s;e unfaithful me&s;&s;engers. I have had but three, and I reckon that &s;hort one
<PB N="200" REF="234">
from D&mdash;, which was rather a dying ejacu|lation than a letter.</P>
<P>You have contrived to &s;ay in your la&s;t the two things mo&s;t plea&s;ing to me: The fir&s;t, that whatever be the fate of your letters, you will continue to write in the di&s;charge of your con|&s;cience. The other is, the ju&s;tice you do me, in taking what I writ to you, in the &s;erious manner it was meant; it is the point upon which I can bear no &s;u&s;picion, and in which, above all, I de&s;ire to be thought &s;erious. It would be vexatious indeed, if you &s;hould pre|tend to take that for wit, which is no more than the natural overflowing of a heart im|proved by an e&s;teem for you: but &s;ince you tell me you believe me, I fancy my expre&s;|&s;ions have not been entirely unfaithful to my thoughts.</P>
<P>May your faith be encrea&s;ed in all truths, that are as great as this; and, depend upon it, to whatever degree it may extend, you can ne|ver be a bigot.</P>
<P>If you could &s;ee the heart I talk of, you would really think it a fooli&s;h good kind of thing, with &s;ome qualities as well-de&s;erving to be half-laughed at, and half-e&s;teemed, as mo&s;t hearts in the world.</P>
<P>Its grand <HI>foible</HI> in regard to you, is the mo&s;t like Rea&s;on of any <HI>foible</HI> in nature. Upon my
<PB N="201" REF="235">
word this heart is not like a great warehou&s;e, &s;tored only with my own goods, or with empty &s;paces to be &s;upplied as fa&s;t as Intere&s;t or Am|bition can fill them: but is every inch of it lett out into lodgings for its friends, and &s;hall never want a corner where your idea will always lie as warm, and as clo&s;e, as any idea in Chri&s;t|endom.</P>
<P>If this di&s;tance (as you are &s;o kind as to &s;ay) enlarges your belief of my friend&s;hip, I a&s;&s;ure you, it has &s;o extended my notion of your va|lue, that I begin to be impious upon that ac|count, and to wi&s;h that even &s;laughter, ruin, and de&s;olation may interpo&s;e between you and the place you de&s;ign for; and that you were re&s;tored to us at the expence of a whole people.</P>
<P>Is there no expedient to return you in peace to the bo&s;om of your country? I hear you are come as far as&mdash;: do you only look back to die twice? is Eurydice once more &s;natched to the &s;hades? If ever mortal had rea&s;on to hate the King, it is I, who&s;e particular misfortune it is, to be almo&s;t the only innocent per&s;on he has made to &s;uffer; both by his Government at home, and his Negotiations abroad.</P>
<P>If you mu&s;t go from us, I wi&s;h at lea&s;t you might pa&s;s to your bani&s;hment by the mo&s;t plea&s;ant way; that all the road might be ro&s;es
<PB N="202" REF="236">
and myrtles, and a thou&s;and objects ri&s;e round you, agreeable enough to make England le&s;s de&s;irable to you. It is not now my intere&s;t to wi&s;h England agreeable: It is highly probable it may u&s;e me ill enough to drive me from it. Can I think that place my country, where I cannot now call a foot of paternal <HI>Earth</HI> my own? Yet it may &s;eem &s;ome alleviation, that when the wi&s;e&s;t thing I can do is to leave my country, what was mo&s;t agreeable in it &s;hould fir&s;t be &s;natched away from it.</P>
<P>I could overtake you with plea&s;ure in&mdash;, and make that tour in your company. Every rea|&s;onable entertainment and beautiful view would be doubly engaging when you partook of it. I &s;hould at lea&s;t attend you to the &s;ea coa&s;ts, and ca&s;t a la&s;t look after the &s;ails that tran&s;ported you. But perhaps I might care as little to &s;tay behind you; and be full as unea&s;y to live in a country where I &s;aw others per&s;ecuted by the rogues of my own religion, as where I was per&s;ecuted my&s;elf by the rogues of yours. And it is not impo&s;&s;ible I might run into A&s;ia in &s;earch of liberty; for who would not rather live a freeman among a nation of &s;laves, than a &s;lave among a nation of freemen?</P>
<P>In good earne&s;t, if I knew your motions, and your exact time; I verily think, I &s;hould be once more happy in a &s;ight of you next &s;pring.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<P>YOU will find me more trouble&s;ome than ever Brutus did his evil Genius; I &s;hall meet you in more places than one, and often refre&s;h your memory before you arrive at your Philippi. The&s;e &s;hadows of me (my letters) will be haunting you from time to time, and putting you in mind of the man who has really &s;uffer'd very much from you, and whom you have robb'd of the mo&s;t valuable of his enjoy|ments, your conver&s;ation. The advantage of hearing your &s;entiments by di&s;covering mine, was what I always thought a great one, and even worth the ri&s;que I generally run of mani|fe&s;ting my own indi&s;cretion. You then re|warded my tru&s;t in you the moment it was given, for you pleas'd or inform'd me the mi|nute you an&s;wer'd. I mu&s;t now be contented with more &s;low returns. However, 'tis &s;ome plea&s;ure, that your thoughts upon paper will be a more la&s;ting po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion to me, and that I &s;hall no longer have cau&s;e to complain of a lo&s;s I have &s;o often regretted, that of any thing you &s;aid, which I happen'd to forget. In earne&s;t,
<PB N="204" REF="238">
Madam, if I were to write to you as often as I think of you, it mu&s;t be every day of my life. I attend you in &s;pirit thro' all your ways, I fol|low you through every &s;tage in books of tra|vels, and fear for you thro' whole folio's; you make me &s;hrink at the pa&s;t dangers of dead tra|vellers; and if I read of a delightful pro&s;pect, or agreeable place, I hope it yet &s;ub&s;i&s;ts to plea&s;e you. I enquire the roads, the amu&s;e|ments, the company, of every town and coun|try thro' which you pa&s;s, with as much dili|gence, as if I were to &s;et out next week to overtake you. In a word, no one can have you more con&s;tantly in mind, not even your Guardian-angel (if you have one) and I am willing to indulge &s;o much Popery as to fancy &s;ome Being takes care of you, who knows your value better than you do your&s;elf: I am willing to think that Heaven never gave &s;o much &s;elf|neglect and re&s;olution to a woman, to occa&s;ion her calamity; but am pious enough to believe tho&s;e qualities mu&s;t be intended to conduce to her benefit and her glory.</P>
<P>Your fir&s;t &s;hort letter only &s;erves to &s;how me you are alive: it puts me in mind of the fir&s;t dove that return'd to Noah, and ju&s;t made him know it had found no re&s;t abroad.</P>
<P>There is nothing in it that plea&s;es me, but when you tell me you had no &s;ea-&s;ickne&s;s. I
<PB N="205" REF="239">
beg your next may give me all the plea&s;ure it can, that is, tell me any that you receive. You can make no di&s;coveries that will be half &s;o va|luable to me as tho&s;e of your own mind. No|thing that regards the &s;tates or kingdoms you pa&s;s thro', will engage &s;o much of my curio|&s;ity or concern, as what relates to your&s;elf: Your welfare, to &s;ay truth, is more at my heart than that of Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>I am &s;ure I may defend the truth, tho' per|haps not the virtue, of this declaration. One is ignorant, or doubtful at be&s;t, of the merits of differing religions and governments: but pri|vate virtues one can be &s;ure of. I therefore know what particular Per&s;on has de&s;ert enough to merit being happier than others, but not what Nation de&s;erves to conquer or oppre&s;s an|other. You will &s;ay, I am not <HI>public-&s;pirited;</HI> let it be &s;o, I may have too many tenderne&s;&s;es, particular regards, or narrow views; but at the &s;ame time I am certain that whoever wants the&s;e, can never have a Public &s;pirit; for (as a friend of mine &s;ays) how is it po&s;&s;ible for that man to love twenty thou&s;and people, who ne|ver loved one?</P>
<P>I communicated your letter to Mr. C&mdash;, he thinks of you and talks of you as he ought, I mean as I do, and one always thinks that to be ju&s;t as it ought. His health and mine are
<PB N="206" REF="240">
now &s;o good, that we wi&s;h with all our &s;ouls you were a witne&s;s of it. We never meet but we lament over you: we pay a kind of weekly rites to your memory, where we &s;trow flowers of rhetoric, and offer &s;uch libations to your name as it would be profane to call Toa&s;ting. The Duke of B&mdash;m is &s;ometimes the High Prie&s;t of your prai&s;es; and upon the whole, I believe there are as few men that are not &s;orry at your departure, as women that are; for, you know, mo&s;t of your &s;ex want good &s;en&s;e, and therefore mu&s;t want genero&s;ity: You have &s;o much of both, that, I am &s;ure, you pardon them; for one cannot but forgive whatever one de&s;pi&s;es. For my part I hate a great many wo|men for your &s;ake, and undervalue all the re&s;t. 'Tis you are to blame, and may God revenge it upon you, with all tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings and earthly pro&s;perities, which, the Divines tell us, are the cau&s;e of our perdition; for if he makes you happy in this world, I dare tru&s;t your own vir|tue to do it in the other.</P>

<P>I Have this moment received the favour of yours of the 8th in&s;tant; and will make you a true excu&s;e (tho' perhaps no very good one) that I deferred the troubling you with a letter,
<PB N="211" REF="245">
when I &s;ent back your papers, in hopes of &s;ee|ing you at Binfield before this time. If I had met with any fault in your performance, I &s;hould freely now (as I have done too pre|&s;umptuou&s;ly in conver&s;ation with you) tell you my opinion; which I have frequently ventured to give you, rather in compliance with your de&s;ires than that I could think it rea&s;onable. For I am not yet &s;atisfied upon what grounds I can pretend to judge of poetry, who never have been practi&s;ed in the art. There may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ome happy genius's, who may judge of &s;ome of the natural beauties of a poem, as a man may of the proportions of a building, without having read Vitruvius, or knowing any thing of the rules of architec|ture: but this, tho' it may &s;ometimes be in the right, mu&s;t be &s;ubject to many mi&s;takes, and is certainly but a &s;uperficial knowledge; without entring into the art, the methods, and the par|ticular excellencies of the whole compo&s;ure, in all the parts of it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides my want of &s;kill, I have another rea&s;on why I ought to &s;u&s;pect my&s;elf, by rea|&s;on of the great affection I have for you; which might give too much bias to be kind to every thing that comes from you. But after all, I mu&s;t &s;ay (and I do it with an old-fa&s;hion|ed &s;incerity) that I entirely approve of your

tran&s;lation of tho&s;e pieces of Homer, both as to the ver&s;ification and the true &s;en&s;e that &s;hines thro' the whole: Nay I am confirmed in my former application to you, and give me leave to renew it upon this occa&s;ion, that you would proceed in tran&s;lating that incomparable Poet, to make him &s;peak good Engli&s;h, to dre&s;s his admirable characters in your proper, &s;ignifi|cant, and expre&s;&s;ive conceptions, and to make his works as u&s;eful and in&s;tructive to this de|generate age, as he was to our friend Horace, when he read him at <HI>Praene&s;te: Qui, quid &s;it pulchrum, quid turpe, quid utile, quid non,</HI> &amp;c. I break off with that <HI>quid non?</HI> with which I confe&s;s I am charm'd.</P>
<P>Upon the whole matter I intreat you to &s;end this pre&s;ently to be added to the Mi&s;cellanies, and, I hope, it will come time enough for that purpo&s;e.</P>

You have given me the true&s;t &s;atisfaction imaginable not only in making good the ju&s;t opinion I have ever had of your reach of thought, and my Idea of your comprehen&s;ive genius; but like|wi&s;e in that plea&s;ure I take as an Engli&s;hman to &s;ee the French, even Boileau him&s;elf in his Lutrin, out-done in your poem: for you de&s;|cend, <HI>leviore plectro,</HI> to all the nicer touches, that your own ob&s;ervation and wit furni&s;h, on &s;uch a &s;ubject as requires the fine&s;t &s;trokes and the livelie&s;t imagination. But I mu&s;t &s;ay no more (tho' I could a great deal) on what plea&s;es me &s;o much: and henceforth, I hope, you will ne|ver condemn me of partiality, &s;ince I only &s;wim

I now come to what is of va&s;t moment, I mean the pre&s;ervation of your health, and beg of you earne&s;tly to get out of all Tavern-company, and fly away <HI>tanquam ex incendio.</HI> What a mi&s;ery is it for you to be de&s;troy'd by the fool|i&s;h kindne&s;s ('tis all one whether real or pre|tended) of tho&s;e who are able to bear the poi|&s;on of bad wine, and to engage you in &s;o un|equal a combat?

<P>THough any thing you write is &s;ure to be a plea&s;ure to me, yet I mu&s;t own your la&s;t letter made me unea&s;y; you really u&s;e a
<PB N="215" REF="249">
&s;tyle of compliment, which I expect as little as I de&s;erve it. I know 'tis a common opinion that a young &s;cribler is as ill pleas'd to hear truth as a young lady. From the moment one &s;ets up for an author, one mu&s;t be treated as ceremoniou&s;ly, that is as unfaithfully,
<Q><L>As a King's Favourite, or as a King.</L></Q>
This proceeding, join'd to that natural vanity which fir&s;t makes a man an author, is certainly enough to render him a coxcomb for life. But I mu&s;t grant it is a ju&s;t judgment upon poets, that they, who&s;e chief pretence is Wit, &s;hould be treated as they them&s;elves treat Fools, that is, be cajol'd with prai&s;es. And, I believe, Poets are the only poor fellows in the world whom any body will flatter.</P>
<P>I would not be thought to &s;ay this, as if the obliging letter you &s;ent me de&s;erv'd this impu|tation, only it put me in mind of it; and I fancy one may apply to one's friend what Cae&s;ar &s;aid of his wife: <Q>&startq;It was not &s;ufficient that he knew her to be cha&s;te him&s;elf, but &s;he &s;he &s;hould not be &s;o much as &s;u&s;pected.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>As to the wonderful di&s;coveries, and all the good news you are pleas'd to tell me of my&s;elf, I treat it, as you who are in the &s;ecret, treat common news, as groundle&s;s reports of things at a di&s;tance; which I, who look into the true
<PB N="216" REF="250">
&s;prings of the affair, in my own brea&s;t, know to have no foundation at all. For Fame, tho' it be (as Milton finely calls it) <HI>the la&s;t infirmity of noble minds,</HI> is &s;carce &s;o &s;trong a temptation as to warrant our lo&s;s of time here: it can ne|ver make us lie down contentedly on a death|bed, (as &s;ome of the Ancients are &s;aid to have done with that thought.) You, Sir, have your|&s;elf taught me, that an ea&s;y &s;ituation at that hour can proceed from no ambition le&s;s noble than that of an eternal felicity, which is unat|tainable by the &s;tronge&s;t endeavours of the wit, but may be gain'd by the &s;incere intentions of the heart only. As in the next world, &s;o in this, the only &s;olid ble&s;&s;ings are owing to the goodne&s;s of the mind, not the extent of the capacity; friend&s;hip here is an emanation from the &s;ame &s;ource as beatitude there: the &s;ame benevolence and grateful di&s;po&s;ition that quali|fies us for the one, if extended farther, makes us partakers of the other. The utmo&s;t point of my de&s;ires in my pre&s;ent &s;tate terminates in the &s;ociety and good-will of worthy men, which I look upon as no ill earne&s;t and foreta&s;te of the &s;ociety and alliance of happy &s;ouls here|after.</P>
<P>The continuance of your favours to me is what not only makes me happy, but cau&s;es me to &s;et &s;ome value upon my&s;elf as a part of your

The whigs are unwilling to be di&s;tanc'd this way, and therefore de&s;ign a pre&s;ent to the &s;ame Cato very &s;peedily; in the mean time they are getting ready as good a &s;entence as the for|mer on their &s;ide: &s;o betwixt them, 'tis pro|bable that Cato (as Dr. Garth expre&s;s'd it) may have &s;omething to live upon, after he dies.</P>

<P>IT was one of the Enigma's of Pythagoras, <Q>&startq;When the winds ri&s;e, wor&s;hip the E|cho.&endq;</Q> A modern writer explains this to &s;ig|nify, <Q>&startq;When popular tumults begin, retire to &s;olitudes, or &s;uch places where Echo's are commonly found, rocks, woods, &amp;c.&endq;</Q> I am rather of opinion it &s;hould be interpreted, <Q>&startq;When rumours increa&s;e, and when there is abundance of noi&s;e and clamour, believe the &s;econd report:&endq;</Q> This I think agrees more exactly with the echo, and is the more natu|ral application of the &s;ymbol. However it be, either of the&s;e Precepts is extremely proper to be followed at this &s;ea&s;on; and I cannot but applaud your re&s;olution of continuing in what you call your cave in the fore&s;t, this winter; and preferring the noi&s;e of breaking ice to that

<P>I &s;incerely wi&s;h my&s;elf with you, to contem|plate the wonders of God in the firmament, ra|ther than the madne&s;s of man on the earth. But I never had &s;o much cau&s;e as now to com|plain of my poetical &s;tar, that fixes me, at this tumultous time, to attend the gingling of rhymes and the mea&s;uring of &s;yllables: to be almo&s;t the only trifler in the nation; and as ridiculous as the poet in Petronius, who, while all the re&s;t in the &s;hip were either labouring or praying for life, was &s;cratching his head in a little room, to write a fine de&s;cription of the tempe&s;t.</P>
<P>You tell me, you like the &s;ound of no arms but tho&s;e of Achilles: for my part I like them as little as any other arms. I li&s;ted my&s;elf in the battles of Homer, and I am no &s;ooner in war, but, like mo&s;t other folks, I wi&s;h my|&s;elf out again.</P>
<P>I heartily join with you in wi&s;hing Quiet to our native country: Quiet in the &s;tate, which, like Charity in religion, is too much the per|fection and happine&s;s of either, to be broken or violated on any pretence or pro&s;pect what|&s;oever. Fire and &s;word, and fire and faggot,

The few ob&s;ervations in my hand in the margins, are what a morning's lei&s;ure permitted me to make purely for your peru&s;al. For I am of opinion that &s;uch a cri|tic, as you will find him by the latter part of his Book, is but one way to be properly an&s;wer'd, and that way I would not take after what he informs me in his preface, that he is at this time

per&s;ecuted by fortune. This I knew not be|fore; if I had, his name had been &s;pared in the E&s;&s;ay, for that only rea&s;on. I can't conceive what ground he has for &s;o exce&s;&s;ive a re&s;ent|ment; nor imagine how tho&s;e <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><LG>

</LG></NOTE> three lines can be called a reflection on his per&s;on, which on|ly de&s;cribe him &s;ubject a little to anger on &s;ome occa&s;ions. I have heard of combatants &s;o very furious, as to fall down them&s;elves with that very blow which they de&s;ign'd to lay heavy on their antagoni&s;ts. But if Mr. Dennis's rage proceeds only from a zeal to di&s;courage young and unexperienced writers from &s;cribling, he &s;hould frighten us with his ver&s;e, not pro&s;e: for I have often known, that, when all the pre|cepts in the world would not reclaim a &s;inner, &s;ome very &s;ad example has done the bu&s;ine&s;s. Yet to give this man his due, he has objected to one or two lines with rea&s;on, and I will al|ter them in ca&s;e of another edition; I will make my enemy do me a kindne&s;s where he meant an injury, and &s;o &s;erve in&s;tead of a friend. What he ob&s;erves at the bottom of page 20 of his reflections, was objected to by your&s;elf, and had been mended but for the ha&s;te of the pre&s;s: I confe&s;s it what the Engli&s;h call a Bull, in the

<P>I &s;hall certainly never make the lea&s;t reply to him; not only becau&s;e you advi&s;e me, but becau&s;e I have ever been of opinion, that, if a book can't an&s;wer for it&s;elf to the public, 'tis to no &s;ort of purpo&s;e for its author to do it <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">In works of Poetry, and generally, in whatever con|cerns the <HI>Compo&s;ition</HI> of a book, this rule is a very good one. In controverted <HI>Opinions</HI> the ca&s;e is different. The advancement of truth, or the defence of an Au|thor's hone&s;t fame, may &s;ometimes make it nece&s;&s;a|ry, or expedient for him to an&s;wer the Objections made to his book.</NOTE>. If I am wrong in any &s;entiment of that E&s;&s;ay, I prote&s;t &s;incerely, I don't de&s;ire all the world &s;hould be deceived (which would be of very ill con&s;equence) merely that I my&s;elf may be thought right (which is of very little con&s;e|quence.) I would be the fir&s;t to recant, for the benefit of others, and the glory of my&s;elf; for (as I take it) when a man owns him&s;elf to have been in an error, he does but tell you in other words, that he is wi&s;er than he was.

The manner in which Mr. D. takes to pieces &s;everal particular lines, detached from their na|tural places, may &s;hew how ea&s;y it is to a ca|viller to give a new &s;en&s;e, or a new non&s;en&s;e to any thing.

<P>Our friend the Abbe is not of that &s;ort, who with the utmo&s;t candour and freedom has mo|de&s;tly told me what others thought, and &s;hewn him&s;elf one (as he very well expre&s;&s;es it) rather of a number than a party. The only difference between us in relation to the Monks, is, that he thinks mo&s;t &s;orts of learning flouri&s;hed among them, and I am opinion, that only &s;ome &s;ort of learning was barely kept alive by them: he be|lieves that in the mo&s;t natural and obvious &s;en&s;e, that line (A &s;econd deluge learning over-run) will be under&s;tood of learning in general; and I fancy 'twill be under&s;tood only (as 'tis meant) of polite learning, critici&s;m, poetry, &amp;c. which is the only learning concerned in the &s;ubject of the E&s;&s;ay.

can the &s;un of faith be &s;aid to &s;ublime the &s;outhern wits, and to ripen the genius's of northern climates? I fear, the&s;e gentlemen un|der&s;tand grammar as little as they do critici&s;m: and, perhaps, out of good-nature to the monks, are willing to take from them the cen&s;ure of ig|norance, and to have it to them&s;elves. The word <HI>they</HI> refers (as, I am &s;ure, I meant, and as I thought every one mu&s;t have known) to tho&s;e Critics there &s;poken of, who are partial to &s;ome particular &s;ett of writers, to the prejudice of all others.

<P>Yet after all, I promi&s;e you, Sir, if the alte|ration of a word or two will gratify any man of &s;ound faith tho' weak under&s;tanding, I will (though it were from no other principle than that of common good-nature) comply with it.

<P>THE concern which you more than &s;eem to be affected with for my reputation, by the &s;everal accounts you have &s;o obligingly given of what reports and cen&s;ures the holy Vandals have thought fit to pa&s;s upon me, makes me de&s;irous of telling &s;o good a friend my whole thoughts of this matter; and of &s;etting before you, in a clear light, the true &s;tate of it.</P>
<P>I have ever believed the be&s;t piece of &s;ervice one could do to our religion, was openly to ex|pre&s;s our dete&s;tation and &s;corn of all tho&s;e mean artifices and <HI>piae fraudes,</HI> which it &s;tands &s;o little in need of, and which have laid it un|der &s;o great a &s;candal among its enemies.</P>
<P>Nothing has been &s;o much a &s;carecrow to them, as that too peremptory and uncharitable
<PB N="234" REF="268">
a&s;&s;ertion of an utter impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;alvation to all but our&s;elves: invincible ignorance excepted, which indeed &s;ome people define under &s;o great limitations, and with &s;uch exclu&s;ions, that it &s;eems as if that word were rather invented as a &s;alvo, or expedient, not to be thought too bold with the thunder-bolts of God (which are hurl|ed about &s;o freely on almo&s;t all mankind by the hands of eccle&s;ia&s;tics) than as a real exception to almo&s;t univer&s;al damnation. For be&s;ides the &s;mall number of the truly faithful in our Church, we mu&s;t again &s;ubdivide; the Jan&s;e|ni&s;t is damned by the Je&s;uit, the Je&s;uit by the Jan&s;eni&s;t, the Scoti&s;t by the Thomi&s;t, and &s;o forth.</P>
<P>There may be Errors, I grant, but I can't think them of &s;uch con&s;equence as to de&s;troy utterly the Charity of mankind; the very great|e&s;t bond in which we are ingaged by God to one another: therefore, I own to you, I was glad of any opportunity to expre&s;s my di&s;like of &s;o &s;hocking a &s;entiment as tho&s;e of the reli|gion I profe&s;s are commonly charged with; and I hoped, a &s;light in&s;inuation, introduced &s;o ea&s;i|ly by a ca&s;ual &s;imilitude only, could never have given offence; but on the contrary mu&s;t needs have done good; in a nation and time, wherein we are the &s;maller party, and con&s;equently
<PB N="235" REF="269">
mo&s;t mi&s;repre&s;ented, and mo&s;t in need of vin|dication.</P>
<P>For the &s;ame rea&s;on, I took occa&s;ion to men|tion the &s;uper&s;tition of &s;ome ages after the &s;ub|ver&s;ion of the Roman Empire, which is too manife&s;t a truth to be denied, and does in no &s;ort reflect upon the pre&s;ent profe&s;&s;ors of our faith, who are free from it. Our &s;ilence in the&s;e points may, with &s;ome rea&s;on, make our adver&s;aries think we allow and per&s;i&s;t in tho&s;e bigotries; which yet in reality all good and &s;en|&s;ible men de&s;pi&s;e, tho' they are per&s;uaded not to &s;peak again&s;t them, I can't tell why, &s;ince now 'tis no way the intere&s;t even of the wor&s;t of our prie&s;thood (as it might have been then) to have them &s;mothered in &s;ilence: For, as the oppo&s;ite &s;ects are now prevailing, 'tis too late to hinder our church from being &s;lander'd; 'tis our bu&s;ine&s;s now to vindicate our&s;elves from being thought abettors of what they charge us with. This can't &s;o well be brought about with &s;erious faces; we mu&s;t laugh with them at what de&s;erves it, or be content to be laughed at, with &s;uch as de&s;erve it.</P>
<P>As to particulars: you cannot but have ob|&s;erved, that at fir&s;t the whole objection again&s;t the &s;imile of Wit and Faith lay to the word They: when that was beyond contradiction re|moved (the very grammar &s;erving to confute
<PB N="236" REF="270">
them) then the objection was again&s;t the &s;imile it&s;elf; or if that &s;imile will not be objected to (&s;en&s;e and common rea&s;on being indeed a little &s;tubborn, and not apt to give way to every bo|dy) next the mention of Super&s;tition mu&s;t be|come a crime; as if Religion and &s;he were &s;i&s;ters, or that it were &s;candal upon the family of Chri&s;t, to &s;ay a word again&s;t the devil's ba&s;tard. Afterwards, more mi&s;chief is di&s;cover'd in a place that &s;eemed innocent at fir&s;t, the two lines about <HI>Schi&s;matics.</HI> An ordinary man would imagine the author plainly declared again&s;t tho&s;e &s;chi&s;matics, for quitting the true faith out of a contempt of the under&s;tanding of &s;ome few of its believers: but the&s;e believers are called <HI>dull,</HI> and becau&s;e I &s;ay that tho&s;e &s;chi&s;|matics think &s;ome believers dull, therefore the&s;e charitable interpreters of my meaning will have it, that I think all believers dull. I was lately telling Mr. ** the&s;e objections: who a&s;|&s;ured me I had &s;aid nothing which a catholic need to di&s;own; and I have cau&s;e to know that gentleman's fault (if he has any) is not want of zeal: He put a notion into my head, which, I confe&s;s, I can't but acquie&s;ce in; that when a &s;ett of people are piqued at any truth which they think to their own di&s;advantage, their me|thod of revenge on the truth-&s;peaker is to attack his reputation a by-way, and not openly to ob|ject
<PB N="237" REF="271">
to the place they are really galled by: what the&s;e therefore (in his opinion) are in earne&s;t angry at, is, that Era&s;mus, whom their tribe oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted, &s;hould be vindicated after an age of obloquy by one of their own people, willing to utter an hone&s;t truth in be|half of the dead, whom no man &s;ure will flat|ter and to whom few will do ju&s;tice. Others, you know, were as angry that I mentioned Mr. Wal&s;h with honour; who as he never refu&s;ed to any one of merit of any party the prai&s;e due to him, &s;o hone&s;tly de&s;erved it from all others, tho' of ever &s;o different intere&s;ts or &s;entiments. May I be ever guilty of this &s;ort of liberty, and latitude of principle! which gives us the hardi|ne&s;s of &s;peaking well of tho&s;e whom envy op|pre&s;&s;es even after death. As I would always &s;peak well of my living friends when they are ab&s;ent, nay becau&s;e they are ab&s;ent, &s;o would I much more of the dead, in that eternal ab|&s;ence; and the rather becau&s;e I expect no thanks for it.</P>
<P>Thus, Sir, you &s;ee I do in my con&s;cience per&s;i&s;t in what I have written; yet in my friend&s;hip I will recant and alter whatever you plea&s;e, in ca&s;e of a &s;econd edition (which I think the book will not &s;o &s;oon arrive at, for Ton&s;on's printer told me he drew off a thou|&s;and copies in this fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and, I fancy,

<P>I Thank you for having given my poem of Wind&s;or Fore&s;t its greate&s;t ornament, that of bearing your name in the front of it.

Nay, tho' we &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon the demoli&s;hing of Boileau's works, the French, as long as they have writers of your form, might have as good an equivalent.</P>
<P>Upon the whole, I am really as proud, as our mini&s;ters ought to be, of the terms I have gain'd from abroad; and I de&s;ign, like them, to publi&s;h &s;peedily to the world the benefits ac|cruing from them; for I cannot re&s;i&s;t the tem|ptation of printing your admirable tran&s;lation here <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This was never done, for the two printed French ver&s;ions are neither of this hand.

<P>YOU have oblig'd me with a very kind letter, by which I find you &s;hift the &s;cene of your life from the town to the country, and enjoy that mix'd &s;tate which wi&s;e men both delight in, and are qualified for. Methinks the morali&s;ts and philo&s;ophers have generally run too much into extremes in commending entire|ly either &s;olitude, or publick life. In the for|mer, men for the mo&s;t part grow u&s;ele&s;s by too much re&s;t, and in the latter are de&s;troy'd by too much precipitation; as waters lying &s;till, pu|trify, and are good for nothing, and running violently on do but the more mi&s;chief in their pa&s;&s;age to others, and are &s;wallow'd up and lo&s;t the &s;ooner them&s;elves. Tho&s;e indeed who can be u&s;eful to all &s;tates, &s;hould be like gentle &s;treams, that not only glide thro' lonely val|leys and fore&s;ts amid&s;t the flocks and the &s;hep|herds, but vi&s;it populous towns in their cour&s;e, and are at once of ornament and &s;ervice to them. But there are another &s;ort of people who &s;eem de&s;ign'd for &s;olitude, &s;uch, I mean, as have more to hide than to &s;how. As for my own part, I am one of tho&s;e of whom Seneca &s;ays, <HI>I am</HI>

<P>YOU formerly ob&s;erv'd to me, that no|thing made a more ridiculous figure in a man's life, than the di&s;parity we often find in him &s;ick and well: thus one of an unfortunate con&s;titution is perpetually exhibiting a mi&s;era|ble example of the weakne&s;s of his mind, and of his body, in their turns. I have had fre|quent opportunities of late to con&s;ider my&s;elf in the&s;e different views, and, I hope, have receiv'd &s;ome advantage by it, if what Waller &s;ays be true, that
<Q><L>The &s;oul's dark cottage, batter'd and decay'd,</L>
<L>Lets in new light thro' chinks that time has made.</L></Q>
Then &s;urely &s;ickne&s;s, contributing no le&s;s than old age to the &s;haking down this &s;caffold|ing of the body, may di&s;cover the inward &s;tructure more plainly. Sickne&s;s is a &s;ort of early old age: it teaches us a diffidence in our earthly &s;tate, and in&s;pires us with the thoughts of a future, better than a thou&s;and volumes of philo&s;ophers and divines. It gives &s;o warning a concu&s;&s;ion to tho&s;e props of our vanity, our
<PB N="254" REF="288">
&s;trength and youth, that we think of fortifying our&s;elves within, when there is &s;o little depend|ance upon our out-works. Youth at the very be&s;t is but a betrayer of human life in a gen|tler and &s;moother manner than age: 'tis like a &s;tream that nouri&s;hes a plant upon a bank, and cau&s;es it to flouri&s;h and blo&s;&s;om to the &s;ight, but at the &s;ame time is undermining it at the root in &s;ecret. My youth has dealt more fair|ly and openly with me, it has afforded &s;everal pro&s;pects of my danger, and given me an ad|vantage not very common to young men, that the attractions of the world have not dazzled me very much; and I begin, where mo&s;t peo|ple end, with a full conviction of the empti|ne&s;s of all &s;orts of ambition, and the un&s;ati&s;|factory nature of all human plea&s;ures. When a &s;mart fit of &s;ickne&s;s tells me this &s;curvy tene|ment of my body will fall in a little time, I am e'en as unconcern'd as was that hone&s;t Hi|bernian, who being in bed in the great &s;torm &s;ome years ago, and told the hou&s;e would tum|ble over his head, made an&s;wer, What care I for the hou&s;e? I am only a lodger. I fancy 'tis the be&s;t time to die when one is in the be&s;t hu|mour; and &s;o exce&s;&s;ively weak as I now am, I may &s;ay with con&s;cience, that I am not at all unea&s;y at the thought, that many men, whom I never had any e&s;teem for, are likely to enjoy
<PB N="255" REF="289">
this world after me. When I reflect what an incon&s;iderable little atom every &s;ingle man is, with re&s;pect to the whole creation, methinks, 'tis a &s;hame to be concern'd at the removal of &s;uch a trivial animal as I am. The morning after my exit, the &s;un will ri&s;e as bright as ever, the flowers &s;mell as &s;weet, the plants &s;pring as green, the world will proceed in its old cour&s;e, people will laugh as heartily, and marry as fa&s;t, as they were us'd to do. The memory of man, (as it is elegantly expre&s;s'd in the Book of Wi&s;dom) pa&s;&s;eth away as the remembrance of a gue&s;t that tarrieth but one day. There are rea&s;ons enough, in the fourth chapter of the &s;ame book, to make any young man content|ed with the pro&s;pect of death. <Q>&startq;For honour|able age is not that which &s;tandeth in length of time, or is mea&s;ur'd by number of years. But wi&s;dom is the grey hair to men, and an un&s;potted life is old age.

<P>I Was the other day in company with five or &s;ix men of &s;ome learning; where chancing to mention the famous ver&s;es which the Em|peror Adrian &s;poke on his death-bed, they were all agreed that 'twas a piece of gaiety unwor|thy of that prince in tho&s;e circum&s;tances. I could not but differ from this opinion: me|thinks it was by no means a gay, but a very &s;erious &s;oliloquy to his &s;oul at the point of its departure; in which &s;en&s;e I naturally took the ver&s;es at my fir&s;t reading them, when I was very young, and before I knew what interpretation the world generally put upon them.</P>

<P>I confe&s;s I cannot apprehend where lies the trifling in all this: 'tis the mo&s;t natural and obvious reflection imaginable to a dying man: and if we con&s;ider the Emperor was a heathen, that doubt concerning the future fate of his &s;oul will &s;eem &s;o far from being the effect of want of thought, that 'twas &s;carce rea&s;onable he &s;hould think otherwi&s;e; not to mention that here is a plain confe&s;&s;ion included of his belief in its immortality. The diminutive epithets of <HI>vagula, blandula,</HI> and the re&s;t, appear not to me as expre&s;&s;ions of levity, but rather of en|dearment and concern; &s;uch as we find in Ca|tullus, and the authors of <HI>Hendeca-&s;yllabi</HI> after him, where they are u&s;ed to expre&s;s the ut|mo&s;t love and tenderne&s;s for their mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.&mdash;If you think me right in my notion of the la&s;t words of Adrian, be pleas'd to in&s;ert it in the Spectator; if not, to &s;uppre&s;s it.</P>

as things of this nature &s;eem) are yet of no &s;light con&s;equence, to people whom every body talks of and every body as he plea&s;es. 'Tis a &s;ort of Tax that attends an e&s;tate in Par|na&s;&s;us, which is often rated much higher than in proportion to the &s;mall po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion an author holds. For indeed an author, who is once come upon the town, is enjoy'd without being thanked for the plea&s;ure, and &s;ometimes ill|treated by tho&s;e very per&s;ons who fir&s;t debauch|ed him. Yet, to tell you the bottom of my heart, I am no way di&s;plea&s;ed that I have of|fended the violent of all parties already; and at the &s;ame time I a&s;&s;ure you con&s;cientiou&s;ly, I feel not the lea&s;t malevolence or re&s;entment again&s;t any of tho&s;e who mi&s;repre&s;ent me, or are di&s;&s;atisfied with me.

<P>As I hope, and would flatter my&s;elf, that you know me and my thoughts &s;o entirely as never to be mi&s;taken in either, &s;o 'tis a plea|&s;ure to me that you gue&s;s'd &s;o right in regard to the author of that Guardian you mentioned.

This, I know, you will laugh at as well as I do; yet I doubt not but many little calumniators and per&s;ons of &s;our di&s;po&s;itions will take occa&s;ion hence to be&s;patter me. I confe&s;s I &s;corn nar|row &s;ouls, of all parties, and if I renounce my rea&s;on in religious matters, I'll hardly do it in any other.</P>
<P>I can't imagine whence it comes to pa&s;s that the few Guardians I have written are &s;o gene|rally known for mine: that in particular which you mention I never di&s;covered to any man but the publi&s;her, till very lately: yet almo&s;t every body told me of it.</P>
<P>As to his taking a more Politic turn, I can|not any way enter into that &s;ecret, nor have I been let into it, any more than into the re&s;t of his politics. Tho' 'tis &s;aid, he will take into the&s;e papers al&s;o &s;everal &s;ubjects of the politer kind, as before: But, I a&s;&s;ure you, as to my|&s;elf, I have quite done with them for the fu|ture.

<P>I Have been lying in wait for my own ima|gination, this week and more, and watch|ing what thoughts came up in the whirl of the fancy, that were worth communicating to you in a letter. But I am at length convinced that
<PB N="271" REF="305">
my rambling head can produce nothing of that &s;ort; &s;o I mu&s;t e'en be contented with telling you the old &s;tory, that I love you heartily. I have often found by experience, that nature and truth, tho' never &s;o low or vulgar, are yet plea&s;ing when openly and artle&s;sly repre&s;ented: It would be diverting to me to read the very letters of an infant, could it write its innocent incon&s;i&s;tencies and tautologies ju&s;t as it thought them. This makes me hope a letter from me will not be unwelcome to you, when I am con|&s;cious I write with more unre&s;ervedne&s;s than ever man wrote, or perhaps talk'd to another. I tru&s;t your good-nature with the whole range of my follies, and really love you &s;o well, that I would rather you &s;hould pardon me than e&s;teem me; &s;ince one is an act of goodne&s;s and benevolence, the other a kind of con&s;trained deference.</P>
<P>You can't wonder my thoughts are &s;carce con&s;i&s;tent, when I tell you how they are di&s;|tracted. Every hour of my life my mind is &s;trangely divided; this minute perhaps I am above the &s;tars, with a thou&s;and &s;y&s;tems round about me, looking forward into a va&s;t aby&s;s, and lo&s;ing my whole comprehen&s;ion in the boundle&s;s &s;pace of Creation, in dialogues with Whi&s;ton and the A&s;tronomers; the next mo|ment I am below all trifles groveling with T*
<PB N="272" REF="306">
in the very centre of non&s;en&s;e: Now I am re|created with the bri&s;k &s;allies and quick turns of wit, which Mr. Steele in his livelie&s;t and free&s;t humours darts about him; and now le|velling my application to the in&s;ignificant ob|&s;ervations and quirks of Grammar of C* and D*.</P>
<P>Good God! what an incongruous animal is man! how un&s;ettled in his be&s;t part, his &s;oul; and how changing and variable in his frame of body? the con&s;tancy of the one &s;hook by eve|ry notion, the temperament of the other affect|ed by every bla&s;t of wind! What is he altoge|ther but one mighty incon&s;i&s;tency; &s;ickne&s;s and pain is the lot of one half of him: doubt and fear the portion of the other! What a bu&s;tle we make about pa&s;&s;ing our time, when all our &s;pace is but a point? what aims and ambi|tions are crowded into this little in&s;tant of our life, which (as Shake&s;pear finely words it) is rounded with a &s;leep? Our whole extent of be|ing is no more, in the eye of him who gave it, than a &s;carce perceptible moment of dura|tion. Tho&s;e animals who&s;e circle of living is limited to three or four hours, as the natura|li&s;ts tell us, are yet as long-lived and po&s;&s;e&s;s as wide a &s;cene of action as man, if we con&s;ider him with a view to all Space, and all Eternity. Who knows what plots, what atchievements a
<PB N="273" REF="307">
mite may perform in his kingdom of a grain of du&s;t, within his life of &s;ome minutes; and of how much le&s;s con&s;ideration than even this, is the life of man in the &s;ight of God, who is from ever, and for ever?</P>
<P>Who that thinks in this train, but mu&s;t &s;ee the world and its contemptible grandeurs, le&s;&s;en before him at every thought? 'Tis enough to make one remain &s;tupify'd in a poize of in|action, void of all de&s;ires, of all de&s;igns, of all friend&s;hips.</P>
<P>But we mu&s;t return (thro' our very condition of being) to our narrow &s;elves, and tho&s;e things that affect our&s;elves: our pa&s;&s;ions, our intere&s;ts flow in upon us, and unphilo&s;ophize us into mere mortals. For my part, I never return &s;o much into my&s;elf, as when I think of you, who&s;e friend&s;hip is one of the be&s;t comforts I have for the in&s;ignificancy of my&s;elf.</P>

give my&s;elf up for &s;ome time, unle&s;s when I &s;natch an hour to plea&s;e my&s;elf with a di&s;tant conver&s;ation with you and a few others, by writing. 'Tis no comfortable pro&s;pect to be reflecting, that &s;o long a &s;iege as that of Troy lies upon my hands, and the campagne above half over, before I have made any progre&s;s. Indeed the Greek fortification upon a nearer ap|proach does not appear &s;o formidable as it did, and I am almo&s;t apt to flatter my&s;elf, that Ho|mer &s;ecretly &s;eems inclined to a corre&s;pondence with me, in letting me into a good part of his intentions. There are, indeed, a &s;ort of un|derling auxiliars to the difficulty of a work, call'd Commentators and Critics, who would frighten many people by their number and bulk, and perplex our progre&s;s under pretence of fortifying their author. The&s;e lie very low in the trenches and ditches they them&s;elves have digged, encompa&s;&s;ed with dirt of their own heaping up; but, I think, there may be found a method of coming at the main works by a more &s;peedy and gallant way than by min|ing under ground, that is, by u&s;ing the poeti|cal engines, wings, and flying over their heads <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">There is a &s;trange con|fu&s;ion in this long continued metaphor: &s;ometimes the <HI>fortifications</HI> &s;poken of are to keep the ignorant out, &s;ome|times to let them in, and &s;ometimes only to quibble with, as in the words <HI>[un|der pretence of fortifying their author.]</HI> But it is no matter.

The former (the con&s;tant attendant upon all great and laudable enterprizes) I have already experienced. Some have &s;aid I am not a ma&s;ter in the Greek, who either are &s;o them|&s;elves or are not: if they are not, they can't tell; and if they are, they can't without hav|ing catechiz'd me. But if they can read (for, I know, &s;ome critics can, and others cannot) there are fairly lying before them &s;ome &s;peci|mens of my tran&s;lation from this Author in the Mi&s;cellanies, which they are heartily wel|come to. I have met with as much malignity another way, &s;ome calling me a Tory, becau&s;e the heads of that party have been di&s;tingui&s;h|ingly favourable to me; &s;ome a Whig, becau&s;e I have been favoured with yours, Mr. Con|greve's, and Mr. Craggs's friend&s;hip, and of late with my lord Hallifax's patronage. How much more natural a conclu&s;ion might be formed, by any good-natured man, that a per|&s;on who has been well u&s;ed by all &s;ides, has

I hope for my own part never to have more of either than is con&s;i&s;tent with common Ju&s;tice and Charity, and always as much as becomes a Chri&s;tian and hone&s;t man. Tho' I find it an unfortunate thing to be bred a Papi&s;t here, where one is obnoxious to four parts in five as being &s;o too much or too little; I &s;hall yet be ea&s;y under both their mi&s;takes, and be what I more than &s;eem to be, for I &s;uffer for it. God is my witne&s;s that I no more envy you Prote&s;tants your places and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, than I do our Prie&s;ts, their charity or learning. I am ambitious of nothing but the good opinion of good men, on both &s;ides; for I know that one virtue of a free &s;pi|rit is worth more than all the virtues put to|gether of all the narrow-&s;oul'd people in the world.</P>

Mr. Philips did expre&s;s him&s;elf with much indignation again&s;t me one evening at Button's Coffee-hou&s;e (as I was told) &s;ay|ing, that I was enter'd into a cabal with Dean Swift and others to write again&s;t the Whig-Intere&s;t, and in particular to undermine his own reputation, and that of his friends Steele and Addi&s;on: but Mr. Philips never opened his lips to my face, on this or any like occa&s;ion, tho' I was almo&s;t every night in the &s;ame room with him, nor ever offer'd me any indecorum. Mr. Addi&s;on came to me a night or two after Philips had talk'd in this idle manner, and a&s;|&s;ur'd me of his di&s;belief of what had been &s;aid, of the friend&s;hip we &s;hould always maintain, and de&s;ir'd I would &s;ay nothing further of it. My Lord Hallifax did me the honour to &s;tir in this matter, by &s;peaking to &s;everal people to obviate a fal&s;e a&s;per&s;ion, which might have done me no &s;mall prejudice with one party. How|ever Philips did all he could &s;ecretly to conti|nue the report with the Hanover Club, and kept in his hands the &s;ub&s;criptions paid for me to him, as Secretary to that Club. The heads of it have &s;ince given him to under&s;tand, that they take it ill; but (upon the terms I ought to be with &s;uch a man) I would not a&s;k him for this money, but commi&s;&s;ion'd one of the Players, his equals, to receive it.

<P>YOU mention the account I gave you &s;ome time ago of the things which Philips &s;aid in his fooli&s;hne&s;s: but I can't tell from any thing in your letter, whether you received a long one from me about a fortnight &s;ince. It was principally intended to thank you for the la&s;t obliging favour you did me; and perhaps for that rea&s;on you pa&s;s it in &s;ilence. I there launch'd into &s;ome account of my temporal af|fairs, and intend now to give you &s;ome hints of my &s;piritual. The conclu&s;ion of your let|ter draws this upon you, where you tell me, you prayed for me. Your proceeding, Sir, is contrary to that of mo&s;t other friends, who ne|ver talk of praying for a man after they have done him a &s;ervice, but only when they will do him none. Nothing can be more kind than the hint you give me of the vanity of human &s;ciences, which, I a&s;&s;ure you, I am daily more convinced of; and indeed I have, for &s;ome years pa&s;t, look'd upon all of them no better than amu&s;ements. To make them the ultimate end of our pur&s;uit, is a mi&s;erable and &s;hort am|bition, which will drop from us at every little di&s;appointment here, and even, in ca&s;e of no
<PB N="283" REF="317">
di&s;appointments here, will infallibly de&s;ert us hereafter. The utmo&s;t fame they are capable of be&s;towing, is never worth the pains they co&s;t us, and the time they lo&s;e us. If you at|tain the top of your de&s;ires that way, all tho&s;e who envy you will do you harm; and of tho&s;e who admire you, few will do you good. The un&s;ucce&s;sful writers are your declared enemies, and probably the &s;ucce&s;sful your &s;ecret ones: for tho&s;e hate not more to be excell'd, than the&s;e to be rival'd: And at the up&s;hot, after a life of perpetual application, you reflect that you have been doing nothing for your&s;elf, and that the &s;ame or le&s;s indu&s;try might have gain'd you a friend&s;hip that can never deceive or end, a &s;atisfaction, which prai&s;e cannot be&s;tow nor vanity feel, and a glory, which (tho' in one re&s;pect like fame, not to be had till after death) yet &s;hall be felt and enjoy'd to eternity. The&s;e, dear Sir, are unfeignedly my &s;entiments, when|ever I think at all: for half the things that em|ploy our heads de&s;erve not the name of thoughts, they are only &s;tronger dreams of impre&s;&s;ions upon the imagination: our &s;chemes of govern|ment, our &s;y&s;tems of philo&s;ophy, our golden worlds of poetry, are all but &s;o many &s;hadowy images, and airy pro&s;pects, which ari&s;e to us but &s;o much the livelier and more frequent, as
<PB N="284" REF="318">
we are more overca&s;t with the darkne&s;s, and di&s;turbed with the fumes, of human vanity.</P>
<P>The &s;ame thing that makes old men willing to leave this world, makes me willing to leave poetry, long habit, and wearine&s;s of the &s;ame track. Homer will work a cure upon me; fif|teen thou&s;and ver&s;es are equivalent to four&s;core years, to make one old in rhyme: and I &s;hould be &s;orry and a&s;hamed, to go on jingling to the la&s;t &s;tep, like a waggoner's hor&s;e, in the &s;ame road, and &s;o leave my bells to the next &s;illy animal that will be proud of them. That man makes a mean figure in the eyes of Rea&s;on, who is mea&s;uring &s;yllables and coupling rhymes, when he &s;hould be mending his own &s;oul, and &s;ecuring his own immortality. If I had not this opinion, I &s;hould be unworthy even of tho&s;e &s;mall and limited parts which God has given me; and unworthy of the friend&s;hip of &s;uch a man as you.</P>

<P>I Have no better excu&s;e to offer you, that I have omitted a ta&s;k naturally &s;o plea&s;ing to me as conver&s;ing upon paper with you, but
<PB N="285" REF="319">
that my time and eyes have been wholly em|ploy'd upon Homer, whom, I almo&s;t fear, I &s;hall find but one way of imitating, which is, in his blindne&s;s. I am perpetually afflicted with head-achs, that very much affect my &s;ight, and indeed &s;ince my coming hither I have &s;carce pa&s;t an hour agreeably, except that in which I read your letter. I would &s;eriou&s;ly have you think, you have no man who more truly knows to place a right value on your friend&s;hip, than he who lea&s;t de&s;erves it on all other accounts than his due &s;en&s;e of it. But, let me tell you, you can hardly gue&s;s what a ta&s;k you under|take, when you profe&s;s your&s;elf my friend; there are &s;ome Tories who will take you for a Whig, &s;ome Whigs who will take you for a Tory, &s;ome Prote&s;tants who will e&s;teem you a rank Papi&s;t, and &s;ome Papi&s;ts who will account you a Heretic.</P>
<P>I find by dear experience, we live in an age, where it is criminal to be moderate; and where no one man can be allowed to be ju&s;t to all men. The notions of right and wrong are &s;o far &s;train'd, that perhaps to be in the right &s;o very violently, may be of wor&s;e con&s;equence than to be ea&s;ily and quietly in the wrong. I really wi&s;h all men &s;o well, that, I am &s;atisfied, but few can wi&s;h me &s;o; but if tho&s;e few are &s;uch as tell me they do, I am content, for they are
<PB N="286" REF="320">
the be&s;t people I know. While you believe me what I profe&s;s as to religion, I can bear any thing the bigotted may &s;ay; while Mr. Con|greve likes my poetry, I can endure Dennis, and a thou&s;and more like him; while the mo&s;t hone&s;t and moral of each party think me no ill man, I can ea&s;ily bear that the mo&s;t violent and mad of all parties ri&s;e up to throw dirt at me.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t expect an hundred attacks upon the publication of my Homer. Whoever in our times would be a profe&s;&s;or of learning above his fellows, ought at the very fir&s;t to enter the world with the con&s;tancy and re&s;olution of a primitive Chri&s;tian, and be prepared to &s;uffer all &s;ort of public per&s;ecution. It is certainly to be lamented, that if any man does but en|deavour to di&s;tingui&s;h him&s;elf, or gratify others by his &s;tudies, he is immediately treated as a common enemy, in&s;tead of being looked upon as a common friend; and a&s;&s;aulted as generally as if his whole de&s;ign were to prejudice the State or ruin the Public. I will venture to &s;ay, no man ever ro&s;e to any degree of perfection in writing, but thro' ob&s;tinacy, and an inveterate re&s;olution again&s;t the &s;tream of mankind: So that if the world has received any benefit from the labours of the learned, it was in its own de&s;pite. For when fir&s;t they e&s;&s;ay their parts,
<PB N="287" REF="321">
all people in general are prejudiced again&s;t new beginners; and when they have got a little above contempt, then &s;ome particular per&s;ons, who were before unfortunate in their own at|tempts, are &s;worn foes to them only becau&s;e they &s;ucceed.&mdash;Upon the whole, one may &s;ay of the be&s;t writers, that they pay a &s;evere fine for their fame, which it is always in the power of the mo&s;t worthle&s;s part of mankind to levy upon them when they plea&s;e.</P>

<P>I Am ju&s;t enter'd upon the old way of life again, &s;leep and mu&s;ing. It is my employ|ment to revive the old of pa&s;t ages to the pre|&s;ent, as it is yours to tran&s;mit the young of the pre&s;ent, to the future. I am copying the great Ma&s;ter in one art, with the &s;ame love and di|ligence with which the Painters hereafter will copy you in another.</P>
<P>Thus I &s;hould begin my Epi&s;tle to you, if it were a Dedicatory one. But as it is a friend|ly letter, you are to find nothing mention'd in
<PB N="288" REF="322">
your own prai&s;e but what one only in the world is witne&s;s to, your particular good-natur'd of|fices to me.</P>
<P>I am cut out from any thing but common acknowledgments, or common di&s;cour&s;e: The fir&s;t you would take ill, though I told but half what I ought: &s;o in &s;hort the la&s;t only re|mains.</P>
<P>And as for the la&s;t, what can you expect from a man who has not talk'd the&s;e five days? who is withdrawing his thoughts as far as he can, from all the pre&s;ent world, its cu&s;toms, and its manners, to be fully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd and ab|&s;orpt in the pa&s;t? When people talk of going to Church, I think of &s;acrifices and libations; when I &s;ee the par&s;on, I addre&s;s him as Chry|&s;es prie&s;t of Apollo; and in&s;tead of the Lord's prayer, I begin,

While you in the world are concerned about the Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion, I con&s;ider only how Menelaus may recover Helen, and the Trojan war be put to a &s;peedy conclu&s;ion. I never in|quire if the Queen be well or not, but heartily wi&s;h to be at Hector's funeral. The only things I regard in this life, are whether my friends are well? whether my Tran&s;lation go well on? whether Dennis be writing criti|ci&s;ms?

<P>I Thank you for your good offices, which are numberle&s;s. Homer advances &s;o fa&s;t, that he begins to look about for the ornaments he is to appear in, like a modi&s;h modern author,
<Q><L>Picture in the front,</L>
<L>With bays and wicked rhyme upon't.</L></Q>
I have the greate&s;t proof in nature at pre&s;ent of the amu&s;ing power of Poetry, for it takes me up &s;o entirely, that I &s;carce &s;ee what pa&s;&s;es under my no&s;e, and hear nothing that is &s;aid about me. To follow poetry as one ought, one mu&s;t forget father and mother, and cleave to it alone. My R&ecirc;verie has been &s;o deep, that I have &s;carce had an interval to think my|&s;elf unea&s;y in the want of your company. I now and then ju&s;t mi&s;s you as I &s;tep into bed; this minute indeed I want extremely to &s;ee
<PB N="290" REF="324">
you, the next I &s;hall dream of nothing but the taking of Troy, or the recovery of Bri&s;eis.</P>
<P>I fancy no friend&s;hip is &s;o likely to prove la&s;ting as ours, becau&s;e, I am pretty &s;ure, there never was a friend&s;hip of &s;o ea&s;y a nature. We neither of us demand any mighty things from each other; what Vanity we have expects its gratification from other people. It is not I, that am to tell you what an Arti&s;t you are, nor is it you that are to tell me what a Poet I am; but 'tis from the world abroad we hope, (pi|ou&s;ly hope) to hear the&s;e things. At home we follow our bu&s;ine&s;s, when we have any; and think and talk mo&s;t of each other when we have none. 'Tis not unlike the happy friend|&s;hip of a &s;tay'd man and his wife, who are &s;eldom &s;o fond as to hinder the bu&s;ine&s;s of the hou&s;e from going on all day, or &s;o indolent as not to find con&s;olation in each other every evening. Thus well-meaning couples hold in amity to the la&s;t, by not expecting too much from human nature; while romantic friend|&s;hips, like violent loves, begin with di&s;quiets, proceed to jealou&s;ies, and conclude in animo&s;i|ties. I have lived to &s;ee the fierce advance|ment, the &s;udden turn, and the abrupt period, of three or four of the&s;e enormous friend&s;hips, and am perfectly convinced of the truth of a maxim we once agreed in, that nothing hinders
<PB N="291" REF="325">
the con&s;tant agreement of people who live to|gether, but merely vanity; a &s;ecret in&s;i&s;ting upon what they think their dignity of merit, and an inward expectation of &s;uch an Over|mea&s;ure of deference and regard, as an&s;wers to their own extravagant fal&s;e &s;cale; and which no body can pay, becau&s;e none but them&s;elves can tell, exactly, to what pitch it amounts.</P>

<P>I Have a particular to tell you at this time, which plea&s;es me &s;o much, that you mu&s;t expect a more than ordinary alacrity in every turn. You know I could keep you in &s;u&s;|pence for twenty lines, but I will tell you di|rectly, that Mr. Addi&s;on and I have had a con|ver&s;ation, that it would have been worth your while to have been placed behind the wain&s;cot, or behind &s;ome half-length picture, to have heard. He a&s;&s;ur'd me, that he would make u&s;e not only of his intere&s;t, but of his art to do you &s;ome &s;ervice; he did not mean his art of poetry, but his art at Court; and he is &s;en&s;ible
<PB N="292" REF="326">
that nothing can have a better air for him&s;elf than moving in your favour, e&s;pecially &s;ince in|&s;inuations were &s;pread, that he did not care you &s;hould pro&s;per too much as a poet. He pro|te&s;ts that it &s;hall not be his fault, if there is not the be&s;t intelligence in the world, and the mo&s;t hearty friend&s;hip, &amp;c. He owns, he was a|fraid Dr. Swift might have carried you too far among the enemy, during the heat of the ani|mo&s;ity; but now all is &s;afe, and you are e&s;|cap'd even in his opinion. I promis'd in your name, like a good Godfather, not that you &s;hould renounce the devil and all his works, but that you would be delighted to find him your friend merely for his own &s;ake; therefore prepare your&s;elf for &s;ome civilities.</P>
<P>I have done Homer's head, &s;hadow'd and heighten'd carefully; and I inclo&s;e the out-line of the &s;ame &s;ize, that you may determine whe|ther you would have it &s;o large, or reduced to make room for feuillage or laurel round the oval, or about the &s;quare of the Bu&s;to? perhaps there is &s;omething more &s;olemn in the image it&s;elf, if I can get it well perform'd.</P>

<P>I Am ju&s;t arrived from Oxford, very well di|verted and entertain'd there. Every one is much concern'd for the Queen's death. No panegyrics ready yet for the King.</P>
<P>I admire your whig-principles of re&s;i&s;tance exceedingly, in the &s;pirit of the Barcelonians: I join in your wi&s;h for them. Mr. Addi&s;on's ver&s;es on Liberty, in his letter from Italy, would be a good form of prayer in my opinion, <HI>O Li|berty! thou Godde&s;s heavenly bright!</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>What you mention of the friendly office you endeavour'd to do betwixt Mr. Addi&s;on and me, de&s;erves acknowledgments on my part. You thoroughly know my regard to his cha|racter, and my propen&s;ity to te&s;tify it by all ways in my power. You as thoroughly know the &s;candalous meanne&s;s of that proceeding which was u&s;ed by Philips, to make a man I &s;o highly value, &s;u&s;pect my di&s;po&s;itions toward him. But as, after all, Mr. Addi&s;on mu&s;t be the judge in what regards him&s;elf, and has &s;eem'd to be no very ju&s;t one to me; &s;o, I mu&s;t own to you, I expect nothing but civility from
<PB N="294" REF="328">
him, how much &s;oever I wi&s;h for his friend|&s;hip. As for any offices of real kindne&s;s or &s;er|vice which it is in his power to do me, I &s;hould be a&s;hamed to receive them from any man who had no better opinion of my Morals, than to think me a Party-man: nor of my Temper, than to believe me capable of maligning, or en|vying another's reputation as a poet. So I leave it to time to convince him as to both, to &s;hew him the &s;hallow depths of tho&s;e half-witted creatures who mi&s;-inform'd him, and to prove that I am incapable of endeavouring to le&s;&s;en a per&s;on whom I would be proud to imitate, and therefore a&s;ham'd to flatter. In a word, Mr. Addi&s;on is &s;ure of my re&s;pect at all times, and of my real friend&s;hip whenever he &s;hall think fit to know me for what I am.</P>
<P>For all that pa&s;s'd betwixt Dr. Swift and me, you know the whole (without re&s;erve) of our corre&s;pondence. The engagements I had to him were &s;uch as the actual &s;ervices he had done me, in relation to the &s;ub&s;cription for Homer, obliged me to. I mu&s;t have leave to be grateful to him, and to any one who &s;erves me, let him be never &s;o obnoxious to any par|ty: nor did the Tory-party ever put me to the hard&s;hip of a&s;king this leave, which is the greate&s;t obligation I owe to it; and I expect no greater from the Whig-party than the &s;ame li|berty

<P>I Lay hold of the opportunity given me by my Lord Duke of Shrew&s;bury, to a&s;&s;ure you of the continuance of that e&s;teem and affection I have long born you, and the memory of &s;o many agreeable conver&s;ations as we have pa&s;s'd together. I wi&s;h it were a compliment to &s;ay,
<PB N="301" REF="335">
&s;uch conver&s;ations as are not to be found on this &s;ide of the water: for the Spirit of di&s;&s;en&s;ion is gone forth among us: nor is it a wonder that Button's is no longer Button's, when old Eng|land is no longer old England, that region of ho&s;pitality, &s;ociety, and good humour. Party affects us all, even the wits, tho' they gain as little by politics as they do by their wit. We talk much of fine &s;en&s;e, refin'd &s;en&s;e, and ex|alted &s;en&s;e; but for u&s;e and happine&s;s, give me a little common &s;en&s;e. I &s;ay this in regard to &s;ome gentlemen, profe&s;s'd Wits of our acquaint|ance, who fancy they can make Poetry of con|&s;equence at this time of day, in the mid&s;t of this raging fit of Politics. For, they tell me, the bu&s;y part of the nation are not more divid|ed about Whig and Tory, than the&s;e idle fel|lows of the feather about Mr. T*'s and my Tran&s;lation. I (like the Tories) have the town in general, that is the mob, on my &s;ide; but it is u&s;ual with the &s;maller party to make up in indu&s;try what they want in number, and that is the ca&s;e with the little Senate of Cato. However, if our principles be well con&s;ider'd, I mu&s;t appear a brave Whig, and Mr. T. a rank Tory: I tran&s;lated Homer for the public in general, he to gratify the inordinate de&s;ires of one man only. We have, it &s;eems, a great Turk in poetry, who can never bear a brother
<PB N="302" REF="336">
on the throne; and has his mutes too, a &s;ett of nodders, winkers, and whi&s;perers, who&s;e bu|&s;ine&s;s is to &s;trangle all other offsprings of wit in their birth. The new tran&s;lator of Homer is the humble&s;t &s;lave he has, that is to &s;ay, his fir&s;t Mini&s;ter; let him receive the honours he gives me, but receive them with fear and trem|bling; let him be proud of the approbation of his ab&s;olute Lord, I appeal to the people, as my rightful judges and ma&s;ters; and if they are not inclined to condemn me, I fear no arbi|trary high-flying proceeding from the &s;mall Court-faction at Button's. But after all I have &s;aid of this great man, there is no rupture be|tween us. We are each of us &s;o civil and ob|liging, that neither thinks he is obliged: And I, for my part, treat with him, as we do with the Grand Monarch; who has too many great qualities not to be re&s;pected, though we know he watches any occa&s;ion to oppre&s;s us <NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">We find here mo&s;t of the &s;entiments he &s;oon after put into ver&s;e on this occa&s;ion.</NOTE>.</P>

<P>MEthinks when I write to you, I am mak|ing a confe&s;&s;ion; I have got (I can't tell how) &s;uch a cu&s;tom of throwing my&s;elf out upon paper without re&s;erve. You were not mi&s;|taken in what you judged of my temper of mind when I writ la&s;t. My faults will not be hid from you, and perhaps it is no di&s;prai&s;e to me that they will not: the cleanne&s;s and pu|rity of one's mind is never better proved, than in di&s;covering its own fault at fir&s;t view; as when a &s;tream &s;hews the dirt at its bottom, it &s;hews al&s;o the tran&s;parency of the water.</P>
<P>My &s;pleen was not occa&s;ioned, however, by any thing an abu&s;ive angry critic could write of me. I take very kindly your heroic manner
<PB N="304" REF="338">
of congratulation upon this &s;candal; for I think nothing more honourable, than to be involved in the &s;ame fate with all the great and the good that ever lived; that is, to be envied and cen|&s;ured by bad writers.</P>
<P>You do no more than an&s;wer my expecta|tions of you, in declaring how well you take my freedom, in &s;ometimes neglecting, as I do, to reply to your letters &s;o &s;oon as I ought. Tho&s;e who have a right ta&s;te of the &s;ub&s;tan|tial part of friend&s;hip, can wave the ceremo|nial: a friend is the only one that will bear the omi&s;&s;ion; and one may find who is not &s;o, by the very trial of it.</P>
<P>As to any anxiety I have concerning the fate of my Homer, the care is over with me: the world mu&s;t be the judge, and I &s;hall be the fir&s;t to con&s;ent to the ju&s;tice of its judgment, whatever it be. I am not &s;o arrant an Author as even to de&s;ire, that if I am in the wrong, all mankind &s;hould be &s;o.</P>
<P>I am mightily pleas'd with a &s;aying of Mon|&s;ieur Tourreil: <Q>&startq;When a man writes, he ought to animate him&s;elf with the thoughts of plea&s;|ing all the world: but he is to renounce that de&s;ire or hope, the very moment the book goes out of his hands.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>I write this from Binfield, whither I came ye&s;terday, having pa&s;s'd a few days in my way

<P>THE Farce of the What-d'ye-call-it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Written by Gay.</NOTE> has occa&s;ioned many different &s;peculations in the town. Some look'd upon it as a mere je&s;t upon the Tragic poets, others as a &s;atire upon the late War. Mr. Cromwell, hearing none of the words, and &s;eeing the action to be tragical, was much a&s;toni&s;hed to find the audience laugh;
<PB N="306" REF="340">
and &s;ays the Prince and Prince&s;s mu&s;t doubtle&s;s be under no le&s;s amazement on the &s;ame ac|count. Several templars and others of the more vociferous kind of critics, went with a re&s;olu|tion to hi&s;s, and confe&s;s'd they were forced to laugh &s;o much, that they forgot the de&s;ign they came with. The Court in general has in a very particular manner come into the je&s;t, and the three fir&s;t nights (notwith&s;tanding two of them were court-nights) were di&s;tingui&s;hed by very full audiences of the fir&s;t Quality. The com|mon people of the pit and gallery received it at fir&s;t with great gravity and &s;edatene&s;s, &s;ome few with tears; but after the third day they al&s;o took the hint, and have ever &s;ince been very loud in their claps. There are &s;till &s;ome &s;ober men who cannot be of the general opinion; but the laughers are &s;o much the majority, that one or two critics &s;eem determined to undeceive the town at their proper co&s;t, by writing grave di&s;&s;ertations again&s;t it: to encourage them in which laudable de&s;ign, it is re&s;olved a Preface &s;hall be prefix'd to the Farce, in vindication of the nature and dignity of this new way of writ|ing.</P>
<P>Ye&s;terday Mr. Steele's affair was decided: I am &s;orry I can be of no other opinion than yours, as to his whole carriage and writings of late. But certainly he has not only been puni&s;hed by

others, but &s;uffered much even from his own party in the point of character, nor (I believe) received any amends in that of intere&s;t, as yet, whatever may be his pro&s;pects for the future.</P>

I wi&s;h all violence may &s;ucceed as ill: but am really amazed that &s;o much of that &s;our and perni|cious quality &s;hould be joined with &s;o much natural good humour as, I think, Mr. Steele is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of.</P>

<P>MR. Pope is going to Mr. Jervas's, where Mr. Addi&s;on is &s;itting for his picture; in the mean time amid&s;t clouds of Tobacco at a coffee-hou&s;e I write this letter. There is a grand revolution at Will's; Morice has quitted for a coffee-hou&s;e in the city, and Titcomb is re&s;tored, to the great joy of Cromwell, who was at a great lo&s;s for a per&s;on to conver&s;e with upon the fathers and church-hi&s;tory; the
<PB N="308" REF="342">
knowledge I gain from him, is entirely in painting and poetry; and Mr. Pope owes all his &s;kill in a&s;tronomy to him and Mr. Whi&s;ton, &s;o celebrated of late for his di&s;covery of the longitude in an extraordinary copy of ver&s;es <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Call'd, <HI>An Ode on the Longitude,</HI> in Swift and Pope's Mi&s;cellanies. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>. Mr. Rowe's Jane Gray is to be play'd in Ea&s;ter-week, when Mrs. Oldfield is to per&s;on|ate a character directly oppo&s;ite to female na|ture; for what woman ever de&s;pi&s;ed Sove|reignty? You know Chaucer has a tale where a knight &s;aves his head, by di&s;covering it was the thing which all women mo&s;t coveted. Mr. Pope's Homer is retarded by the great rains that have fallen of late, which cau&s;es the &s;heets to be long a drying: this gives Mr. Lintot great unea&s;ine&s;s, who is now endeavouring to cor|rupt the Curate of his pari&s;h to pray for fair weather, that his work may go on. There is a &s;ix-penny Critici&s;m lately publi&s;hed upon the tragedy of the What-d'ye-call it, wherein he with much judgment and learning calls me a blockhead, and Mr. Pope a knave. His grand charge is again&s;t the Pilgrim's Progre&s;s being read, which, he &s;ays, is directly levell'd at Cato's reading Plato; to back this cen&s;ure, he goes on to tell you, that the Pilgrim's Progre&s;s being mentioned to be the eighth edition, makes the
<PB N="309" REF="343">
reflection evident, the Tragedy of Cato having ju&s;t eight times (as he quaintly expre&s;&s;es it) vi|&s;ited the pre&s;s. He has al&s;o endeavoured to &s;how, that every particular pa&s;&s;age of the play alludes to &s;ome fine part of tragedy, which, he &s;ays, I have injudiciou&s;ly and profanely abu&s;ed <NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">This curious piece was entituled, A compleat Key to the What-d'ye-call it, written by one Griffin a Player, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Lewis Theobald. <BIBL>P.</BIBL></NOTE>.

I fear I mu&s;t get the gout by drinking; purely for a fa&s;hionable pretence to &s;it &s;till long enough to tran&s;late four books of Homer. I hope you'll by that time be up again, and I may &s;ucceed to the bed and couch of my predece&s;&s;or: pray cau&s;e the &s;tuffing to be repaired, and the crutches &s;horten'd for me. The calamity of your gout is what all your friends, that is to &s;ay, all that know you, mu&s;t &s;hare in; we de&s;ire you in your turn to condole

<P>Mr. Thomas Burnet hath play'd the precur|&s;or to the coming of Homer, in a treati&s;e called Homerides.

<P>AS I take ingratitude to be a greater crime than impertinence, I chu&s;e rather to run the ri&s;que of being thought guilty of the lat|ter, than not to return you my thanks for a very agreeable entertainment you ju&s;t now gave me. I have accidentally met with your Rape of the Lock here, having never &s;een it before. Style, painting, judgment, &s;pirit, I had already admired in other of your writings; but in this I am charm'd with the magic of your inven|tion, with all tho&s;e images, allu&s;ions, and in|explicable
<PB N="314" REF="348">
beauties, which you rai&s;e &s;o &s;urpri&s;|ingly, and at the &s;ame time &s;o naturally, out of a trifle. And yet I cannot &s;ay that I was more pleas'd with the reading of it, than I am with the pretext it gives me to renew in your thoughts, the remembrance of one who values no happine&s;s beyond the friend&s;hip of men of wit, learning, and good-nature.</P>
<P>I remember to have heard you mention &s;ome half-form'd de&s;ign of coming to Italy. What might we not expect from a Mu&s;e that &s;ings &s;o well in the bleak climate of England, if &s;he felt the &s;ame warm &s;un and breathed the &s;ame air with Virgil and Horace?</P>
<P>There are here an incredible number of Poets, that have all the inclination, but want the genius, or perhaps the art, of the An|cients. Some among them, who under&s;tand Engli&s;h, begin to reli&s;h our Authors; and I am informed, that at Florence they have tran&s;lated Milton into Italian ver&s;e. If one who knows &s;o well how to write like the old Latin poets, came among them; it would pro|bably be a means to retrieve them from their cold, trivial conceits, to an imitation of their predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>As merchants, antiquaries, men of plea&s;ure, &amp;c. have all different views in travelling; I know not whether it might not be worth a

Poet's while, to travel, in order to &s;tore his mind with &s;trong images of Nature.</P>
<P>Green fields and groves, flowery meadows and purling &s;treams are no where in &s;uch per|fection as in England: but if you would know light&s;ome days, warm &s;uns, and blue &s;kies, you mu&s;t come to Italy: and to enable a man to de|&s;cribe rocks and precipices, it is ab&s;olutely ne|ce&s;&s;ary that he pa&s;s the Alps.</P>
<P>You will ea&s;ily perceive that it is &s;elf-inter|e&s;t makes me &s;o fond of giving advice to one who has no need of it. If you came into the&s;e parts I &s;hould fly to &s;ee you.

<P>IF I had not done my utmo&s;t to lead my life &s;o plea&s;antly as to forget all misfortunes, I &s;hould tell you I reckoned your ab&s;ence no &s;mall one; but I hope you have al&s;o had many good and plea&s;ant rea&s;ons to forget your friends on this &s;ide the world. If a wi&s;h could tran&s;port me to you and your pre&s;ent companions, I could do the &s;ame. Dr. Swift, I believe, is a very good landlord, and a chearful ho&s;t at his own table: I &s;uppo&s;e he has perfectly learnt him|&s;elf, what he has taught &s;o many others, <HI>rupta non in&s;anire lagena:</HI> el&s;e he would not make a proper ho&s;t for your humble &s;ervant, who (you know) tho' he drinks a gla&s;s as &s;eldom as any man, contrives to break one as often. But 'tis a con&s;olation to me, that I can do this, and many other enormities, under my own roof.</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="353">
But that you and I are upon equal terms, in all friendly lazine&s;s, and have taken an invio|lable oath to each other, always to do what we will; I &s;hould reproach you for &s;o long a &s;ilence. The be&s;t amends you can make for &s;aying no|thing to me, is by &s;aying all the good you can of me, which is, that I heartily love and e&s;teem the Dean and Dr. Parnelle.</P>
<P>Gay is yours and theirs. His &s;pirit is awak|ened very much in the cau&s;e of the Dean, which has broke forth in a courageous cou|plet or two upon Sir Richard Blackmore: He has printed it with his name to it, and bravely a&s;&s;igns no other rea&s;on, than that the &s;aid Sir Richard has abu&s;ed Dr. Swift. I have al&s;o &s;uffered in the like cau&s;e, and &s;hall &s;uffer more: unle&s;s Parnelle &s;ends me his Zoilus and Book|worm (which the Bi&s;hop of Clogher, I hear, greatly extols) it will be &s;hortly, <HI>concurrere Bellum atque Virum</HI>&mdash;I love you all, as much as I de&s;pi&s;e mo&s;t wits in this dull country. Ire|land has turned the tables upon England; and if I have no poetical friend in my own nation, I'll be as proud as Scipio, and &s;ay (&s;ince I am reduced to &s;kin and bone) <HI>Ingrata patria, ne</HI> o&s;&s;a <HI>quidem habeas.</HI></P>

<P>THAT you have not heard from me of late, a&s;cribe not to the u&s;ual lazine&s;s of your corre&s;pondent, but to a ramble to Oxford, where your name is mentioned with honour, even in a land flowing with Tories. I had the good fortune there to be often in the conver&s;ation of Doctor Clarke: He entertain'd me with &s;e|veral drawings, and particularly with the origi|nal de&s;igns of Inigo Jones's Whitehall. I there &s;aw and reverenced &s;ome of your fir&s;t pieces; which future painters are to look upon as we Poets do on the Culex of Virgil and Batrachom. of Homer.</P>

However, you have &s;tay'd long enough, methinks, to have painted all the numberle&s;s Hi&s;tories of old Ogygia. If you have begun to be hi&s;torical, I recommend to your hand the &s;tory which every pious Iri&s;h|man ought to begin with, that of St. Patrick; to the end you may be obliged (as Dr. P. was, when he tran&s;lated the Batrachomuomachia) to come into England, to copy the Frogs, and &s;uch other vermine as were never &s;een in that land &s;ince the time of that Confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>I long to &s;ee you a Hi&s;tory painter. You have already done enough for the private, do &s;omething for the public; and be not con|fined, like the re&s;t, to draw only &s;uch &s;illy &s;tories as our own faces tell of us. The An|cients too expect you &s;hould do them right; tho&s;e Statues from which you learned your beautiful and noble Ideas, demand it as a piece of gratitude from you, to make them truly known to all nations, in the account you intend to write of their Characters.

<P>LAST po&s;t brought me the favour of your letter of the 10th Aug. O. S. It would be taking too much upon me to decide, that it was a witty one; I never pretend to more judgment than to know what plea&s;es me, and can a&s;&s;ure you, it was a very agreeable one. The proof I can give you of my &s;incerity in this opinion, is, that I hope and de&s;ire you would not &s;top at this, but continue more of them.</P>
<P>I am in a place where plea&s;ure is continually flowing. The Princes &s;et the example, and the &s;ubjects follow at a di&s;tance. The Ladies are of all parties <NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>i. e.</HI> In all companies.</NOTE>, by which means the conver|&s;ation of the men is very much &s;oftened and fa&s;hioned from tho&s;e blunt di&s;putes on Politics, and rough je&s;ts, we are &s;o guilty of; while the

freedom of the women takes away all forma|lity and con&s;traint. I mu&s;t own, at the &s;ame time, the&s;e Beauties are a little too artificial for my ta&s;te: you have &s;een a French picture, the Original is more painted, and &s;uch a cru&s;t of powder and e&s;&s;ence in their hair, that you can &s;ee no difference between black and red. By di&s;u&s;ing Stays and indulging them&s;elves at table, they run out of all &s;hape; but as to that, they may give a good rea&s;on, they prefer Con|veniency to Parade, and are, by this means, as ready, as they are generally willing, to be cha|ritable.</P>
<P>I am &s;urpriz'd to find I have wrote &s;o much &s;candal; I fancy I am either &s;etting up for a wit, or imagine I mu&s;t write in this &s;tyle to a wit; I hope you'll prove a good-natur'd one, and not only let me hear from you &s;ometimes, but forgive the &s;mall encouragement you meet with.

<P>I Have long had it in my thoughts to trouble you with a letter, but was di&s;couraged for want of &s;omething that I could think worth &s;ending fifteen hundred miles. Italy is &s;uch an exhau&s;ted &s;ubject, that, I dare &s;ay, you'd ea&s;ily forgive my &s;aying nothing of it; and the ima|gination of a Poet is a thing &s;o nice and deli|cate, that it is no ea&s;y matter to find out images capable of giving plea&s;ure to one of the few, who (in any age) have come up to that cha|racter. I am neverthele&s;s lately returned from an i&s;land, where I pa&s;&s;ed three or four months; which, were it &s;et out in its true colours, might, methinks, amu&s;e you agreeably enough for a minute or two. The i&s;land Inarime is an epi|tome
<PB N="328" REF="362">
of the whole earth, containing within the compa&s;s of eighteen miles, a wonderful variety of hills, vales, ragged rocks, fruitful plains, and barren mountains, all thrown together in a mo&s;t romantic confu&s;ion. The air is in the hotte&s;t &s;ea&s;on con&s;tantly refre&s;hed by cool breezes from the &s;ea. The vales produce ex|cellent wheat and Indian corn, but are mo&s;tly covered with vineyards, intermix'd with fruit|trees. Be&s;ides the common kinds, as cherries, apricots, peaches, &amp;c. they produce oranges, limes, almonds, pomegranates, figs, water|melons, and many other fruits unknown to our climates, which lie every where open to the pa&s;&s;enger. The hills are the greater part co|vered to the top with vines, &s;ome with che&s;nut groves, and others with thickets of myrtle and lenti&s;cus. The fields in the northern &s;ide are divided by hedge-rows of myrtle. Several fountains and rivulets add to the beauty of this land&s;cape, which is likewi&s;e &s;et off by the va|riety of &s;ome barren &s;pots, and naked rocks. But that which crowns the &s;cene, is a large mountain, ri&s;ing out of the middle of the i&s;land (once a terrible Volcano, by the ancients called Mons Epomeus) its lower parts are adorned with vines, and other fruits; the middle affords pa&s;ture to flocks of goats and &s;heep; and the top is a &s;andy pointed rock, from which you

have the fine&s;t pro&s;pect in the world, &s;urveying at one view, be&s;ides &s;everal plea&s;ant i&s;lands ly|ing at your feet, a tract of Italy about three hun|dred miles in length, from the promontory of Antium to the cape of Palinurus: the greater part of which hath been &s;ung by Homer and Virgil, as making a con&s;iderable part of the travels and adventures of their two Heroes. The I&s;lands Caprea, Prochyta, and Parthenope, to|gether with Cajeta, Cumae, Monte Mi&s;eno, the habitations of Circe, the Syrens, and the Lae|&s;trigones, the bay of Naples, the promontory of Minerva, and the whole Campagnia felice, make but a part of this noble land&s;cape; which would demand an imagination as warm, and numbers as flowing as your own, to de&s;cribe it. The inhabitants of this delicious i&s;le, as they are without riches and honours, &s;o are they without the vices and follies that attend them; and were they but as much &s;trangers to re|venge, as they are to avarice and ambition, they might in fact an&s;wer the poetical notions of the golden age. But they have got, as an alloy to their happine&s;s, an ill habit of murdering one another on &s;light offences. We had an in&s;tance of this the &s;econd night after our arrival, a youth of eighteen being &s;hot dead by our door: and yet by the &s;ole &s;ecret of minding our own bu&s;i|ne&s;s, we found a means of living &s;ecurely among
<PB N="330" REF="364">
the&s;e dangerous people. Would you know how we pa&s;s the time at Naples? Our chief enter|tainment is the devotion of our neighbours: be&s;ides the gaiety of their Churches (where folks go to &s;ee what they call <HI>una bella Devo|tione</HI> (i. e.) a &s;ort of religious opera) they make fireworks almo&s;t every week, out of de|votion; the &s;treets are often hung with arras, out of devotion; and (what is &s;till more &s;trange) the ladies invite gentlemen to their hou&s;es and treat them with mu&s;ic and &s;weatmeats, out of devotion; in a word, were it not for this devo|tion of its inhabitants, Naples would have little el&s;e to recommend it, be&s;ide the air and &s;itua|tion. Learning is in no very thriving &s;tate here, as indeed no where el&s;e in Italy; however, among many pretenders, &s;ome men of ta&s;te are to be met with. A friend of mine told me not long &s;ince, that, being to vi&s;it Salvini at Flo|rence, he found him reading your Homer: he liked the notes extremely, and could find no other fault with the ver&s;ion, but that he thought it approached too near a paraphra&s;e; which &s;hews him not to be &s;ufficiently acquainted with our language. I wi&s;h you health to go on with that noble work, and when you have that, I need not wi&s;h you &s;ucce&s;s.

You are none of tho&s;e Lawyers who de&s;erve the motto of the de|vil, <HI>Circuit quoerens quem devoret.</HI> But your <HI>Circuit</HI> will at lea&s;t procure you one of the great|e&s;t of temporal ble&s;&s;ings, Health. What an advantageous circum&s;tance is it, for one that loves rambling &s;o well, to be a grave and repu|table rambler? while (like your fellow Cir|cuiteer, the Sun) you travel the round of the earth and behold all the iniquities under the heavens? You are much a &s;uperior genius to me in rambling; you, like a Pigeon (to which I would &s;ooner compare a Lawyer than to a Hawk) can fly &s;ome hundred leagues at a pitch; I, like a poor &s;quirrel, am continually in mo|tion indeed, but it is about a cage of three foot: my little excur&s;ions are but like tho&s;e of a &s;hop-keeper, who walks every day a mile or two be|fore his own door, but minds his bu&s;ine&s;s all the while. Your letter of the Cau&s;e lately be|fore

you, I could not but communicate to &s;ome ladies of your acquaintance. I am of opinion, if you continued a corre&s;pondence of the &s;ame &s;ort during a whole Circuit, it could not fail to plea&s;e the &s;ex, better than half the novels they read; there would be in them what they love above all things, a mo&s;t happy union of Truth and Scandal. I a&s;&s;ure you the Bath affords nothing equal to it: It is on the contrary full of <HI>grave and &s;ad</HI> men, Mr. Baron S. Lord chief Ju&s;tice A.

<OPENER><SALUTE>MY LORD,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IF your Mare could &s;peak, &s;he would give an account of what extraordinary company &s;he had on the road; which &s;ince &s;he cannot do, I will.</P>
<P>It was the enterprizing Mr. Lintott, the re|doubtable rival of Mr. Ton&s;on, who, mounted on a &s;tone-hor&s;e (no di&s;agreeable companion to
<PB N="337" REF="371">
your Lord&s;hip's mare) overtook me in Wind|&s;or-fore&s;t. He &s;aid, he heard I de&s;ign'd for Oxford, the &s;eat of the Mu&s;es, and would, as my book&s;eller, by all means, accompany me thither.</P>
<P>I a&s;k'd him where he got his hor&s;e? He an|&s;wer'd, he got if of his Publi&s;her: <Q>&startq;&endq;For that rogue my Printer (&s;aid he) di&s;appointed me: I hoped to put him in good-humour by a treat at the tavern, of a brown frica&s;&s;ee of rabbits, which co&s;t two &s;hillings, with two quarts of wine, be&s;ides my conver&s;ation. I thought my&s;elf cock&s;ure of his hor&s;e, which he readily promis'd me, but &s;aid that Mr. Ton&s;on had ju&s;t &s;uch another de&s;ign of going to Cambridge, expecting there the copy of a new kind of Horace from Dr.&mdash;, and if Mr. Ton&s;on went, he was preingaged to attend him, being to have the printing of the &s;aid copy.</Q></P>
<Q>&startq;So in &s;hort, I borrow'd this &s;tonehor&s;e of my publi&s;her, which he had of Mr. Oldmixon for a debt; he lent me too the pretty boy you &s;ee after me: he was a &s;mutty dog ye&s;terday, and co&s;t me near two hours to wa&s;h the ink off his face; but the Devil is a fair-condition'd Devil, and very forward in his Catechi&s;e: if you have any more baggs, he &s;hall carry them.&endq;</Q>
<P><PB N="338" REF="372">
I thought Mr. Lintot's civility not to be neg|lected, &s;o gave the boy a &s;mall bag, containing three &s;hirts and an Elzevir Virgil; and mount|ing in an in&s;tant proceeded on the road, with my man before, my courteous &s;tationer be&s;ide, and the afore&s;aid devil behind.</P>
<P>Mr. Lintot began in this manner. <Q>&startq;Now damn them! what if they &s;hould put it into the news-paper, how you and I went toge|ther to Oxford? what would I care? If I &s;hould go down into Su&s;&s;ex, they would &s;ay I was gone to the Speaker. But what of that? If my &s;on were but big enough to go on with the bu&s;ine&s;s, by G&mdash;d I would keep as good company as old Jacob.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Hereupon I enquir'd of his &s;on. <Q>&startq;The lad (&s;ays he) has fine parts, but is &s;omewhat &s;ick|ly, much as you are&mdash;I &s;pare for nothing in his Education at We&s;tmin&s;ter. Pray, don't you think We&s;tmin&s;ter to be the be&s;t &s;chool in England? mo&s;t of the late Mini&s;try came out of it, &s;o did many of this Mini&s;try; I hope the boy will make his fortune.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Don't you de&s;ign to let him pa&s;s a year at Oxford? <Q>&startq;To what purpo&s;e? (&s;aid he) the Univer&s;ities do but make Pedants, and I in|tend to breed him a man of bu&s;ine&s;s.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>As Mr. Lintot was talking, I ob&s;erv'd he &s;ate unea&s;y on his &s;addle, for which I expre&s;s'd
<PB N="339" REF="373">
&s;ome &s;ollicitude: Nothing, &s;ays he, I can bear it well enough; but &s;ince we have the day be|fore us, methinks it would be very plea&s;ant for you to re&s;t a-while under the woods. When we were alighted, <Q>&startq;See here, what a mighty pretty Horace I have in my pocket! what if you amus'd your&s;elf in turning an ode, till we mount again? Lord! if you pleas'd, what a clever Mi&s;cellany might you make at lei&s;ure hours?&endq;</Q> Perhaps I may, &s;aid I, if we ride on; the motion is an aid to my fancy, a round trott very much awakens my &s;pirits: then jog on a pace, and I'll think as hard as I can.</P>
<P>Silence en&s;ued for a full hour; after which Mr. Lintot lugg'd the reins, &s;top'd &s;hort, and broke out, <Q>&startq;Well, Sir, how far have you gone? I an&s;wer'd, Seven miles. Z&mdash;ds, Sir, &s;aid Lintot, I thought you had done &s;even &s;tan|za's. Old&s;worth, in a ramble round Wimble|ton-hill, would tran&s;late a whole ode in half this time. I'll &s;ay that for Old&s;worth (tho' I lo&s;t by his Timothy's) he tran&s;lates an ode of Horace the quicke&s;t of any man in Eng|land. I remember Dr. King would write ver&s;es in a tavern three hours after he could not &s;peak: and there's Sir Richard, in that rumbling old chariot of his, between Fleet|ditch and St. Giles's pound, &s;hall make you half a Job.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="374">
Pray, Mr. Lintot (&s;aid I) now you talk of Tran&s;lators, what is your method of managing them? <Q>&startq;Sir (reply'd he) tho&s;e are the &s;adde&s;t pack of rogues in the world: in a hungry fit, they'll &s;wear they under&s;tand all the lan|guages in the univer&s;e: I have known one of them take down a Greek book upon my counter and cry, Ay, this is Hebrew, I mu&s;t read it from the latter end. By G&mdash;d I can never be &s;ure in the&s;e fellows, for I neither under&s;tand Greek, Latin, French, nor Italian my&s;elf. But this is my way; I agree with them for ten &s;hillings per &s;heet, with a pro|vi&s;o, that I will have their doings corrected by whom I plea&s;e; &s;o by one or other they are led at la&s;t to the true &s;en&s;e of an author; my judgment giving the negative to all my tran&s;lators.&endq;</Q> But how are you &s;ecure tho&s;e correctors may not impo&s;e upon you? <Q>&startq;&endq;Why I get any civil gentleman, (e&s;pecially any Scotchman) that comes into my &s;hop, to read the original to me in Engli&s;h; by this I know whether my fir&s;t tran&s;lator be defi|cient, and whether my corrector merits his money or not?</Q></P>
<Q>&startq;I'll tell you what happen'd to me la&s;t month: I bargain'd with S* for a new ver|&s;ion of Lucretius to publi&s;h again&s;t Ton&s;on's; agreeing to pay the author &s;o many &s;hillings
<PB N="341" REF="375">
at his producing &s;o many lines. He made a great progre&s;s in a very &s;hort time, and I gave it to the corrector to compare with the Latin; but he went directly to Creech's tran&s;|lation, and found it the &s;ame word for word, all but the fir&s;t page. Now, what d'ye think I did? I arre&s;ted the tran&s;lator for a cheat; nay, and I &s;topt the corrector's pay too, upon this proof that he had made u&s;e of Creech in&s;tead of the original.&endq;</Q>
<P>Pray tell me next how you deal with the Critics? <Q>&startq;&endq;Sir (&s;aid he) nothing more ea&s;y. I can &s;ilence the mo&s;t formidable of them: the rich ones for a &s;heet a piece of the blotted ma|nu&s;cript, which co&s;ts me nothing; they'll go about with it to their acquaintance, and pretend they had it from the author, who &s;ubmitted to their correction: this has given &s;ome of them &s;uch an air, that in time they come to be con&s;ulted with, and dedicated to, as the top Critics of the town.&mdash;As for the poor critics, I'll give you one in&s;tance of my management, by which you may gue&s;s at the re&s;t. A lean man, that look'd like a very good &s;cholar, came to me t'other day; he turn'd over your Homer, &s;hook his head, &s;hrug'd up his &s;houlders, and pi&s;h'd at every line of it: One would wonder (&s;ays he) at the &s;trange pre&s;umption of &s;ome men; Ho|mer
<PB N="342" REF="376">
is no &s;uch ea&s;y ta&s;k, that every &s;tripling, every ver&s;ifier&mdash;He was going on, when my wife call'd to dinner: Sir, &s;aid I, will you plea&s;e to eat a piece of beef with me? Mr. Lintot, &s;aid he, I am &s;orry you &s;hould be at the expence of this great book, I am really concern'd on your account&mdash;Sir, I am much obliged to you: if you can dine upon a piece of beef, together with a &s;lice of pud|ding&mdash;Mr. Lintot, I do not &s;ay but Mr. Pope, if he would conde&s;cend to advi&s;e with men of learning&mdash;Sir, the pudding is upon the table, if you plea&s;e to go in&mdash;My critic complies, he comes to a ta&s;te of your poetry, and tells me in the &s;ame breath, that the book is commendable, and the pudding ex|cellent.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Now, Sir, (concluded Mr. Lintot) in return to the frankne&s;s I have &s;hewn, pray tell me, Is it the opinion of your friends at court that my Lord Lan&s;down will be brought to the bar or not?&endq;</Q> I told him I heard he would not, and I hop'd it, my Lord being one I had particular obligations to. <Q>&startq;That may be (re|ply'd Mr. Lintot) but by G-d if he is not, I &s;hall lo&s;e the printing of a very good Trial.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The&s;e, my Lord, are a few traits by which you may di&s;cern the genius of Mr. Lintot,
<PB N="343" REF="377">
which I have cho&s;en for the &s;ubject of a letter. I dropt him as &s;oon as I got to Oxford, and paid a vi&s;it to my Lord Carleton at Middleton.</P>
<P>The conver&s;ations I enjoy here are not to be prejudiced by my pen, and the plea&s;ures from them only to be equal'd when I meet your Lord&s;hip. I hope in a few days to ca&s;t my&s;elf from your hor&s;e at your feet.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To the Duke of BUCKINGHAM.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">(In an&s;wer to a Letter in which he inclo&s;ed the De|&s;cription of Buckingham-hou&s;e, written by him to the D. of Sh.)</HEAD>
<P>PLINY was one of tho&s;e few author, who had a warm hou&s;e over his heads nay two hou&s;es, as appears by two of his epi|&s;tles. I believe, if any of his contemporary authors dur&s;t have inform'd the public where they lodged, we &s;hould have found the gar|rets of Rome as well inhabited, as tho&s;e of Fleet-&s;treet; but 'tis dangerous to let creditors into &s;uch a &s;ecret, therefore we may pre&s;ume that then, as well as now-a-days, no body knew where they lived but their Book&s;ellers.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="378">
It &s;eems, that when Virgil came to Rome, he had no lodging at all: he fir&s;t introduc'd him&s;elf to Augu&s;tus by an epigram, beginning <HI>Nocte pluit tota</HI>&mdash;an ob&s;ervation which proba|bly he had not made, unle&s;s he had lain all night in the &s;treet.</P>
<P>Where Juvenal lived we cannot affirm; but in one of his &s;atyrs he complains of the exce&s;|&s;ive price of lodgings; neither do I believe he would have talk'd &s;o feelingly of Codrus's bed, if there had been room for a bedfellow in it.</P>
<P>I believe, with all the o&s;tentation of Pliny, he would have been glad to have changed both his hou&s;es for your Grace's one; which is a country-hou&s;e in the &s;ummer, and a town-hou&s;e in the winter, and mu&s;t be owned to be the pro|pere&s;t habitation for a wi&s;e man, who &s;ees all the world change every &s;ea&s;on without ever changing him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I have been reading the de&s;cription of Pli|ny's hou&s;e with an eye to yours, but, finding they will bear no compari&s;on, will try if it can be matched by the large country &s;eat I inhabit at pre&s;ent, and &s;ee what figure it may make by the help of a florid de&s;cription.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t expect nothing regular in my de|&s;cription, any more than in the hou&s;e; the whole va&s;t edifice is &s;o disjointed, and the &s;everal
<PB N="345" REF="379">
parts of it &s;o detach'd one from the other, and yet &s;o joining again, one cannot tell how, that, in one of my poetical fits, I imagined it had been a village in Amphion's time, where the cottages having taken a country dance together, had been all out, and &s;tood &s;tone-&s;till with amazement ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>You mu&s;t excu&s;e me, if I &s;ay nothing of the Front; indeed I don't know which it is. A &s;tranger would be grievou&s;ly di&s;appointed, who endeavour'd to get into this hou&s;e the right way. One would rea&s;onably expect after the entry through the Porch to be let into the hall: alas nothing le&s;s! you find your&s;elf in the hou&s;e of office. From the parlour you think to &s;tep into the drawing-room, but upon opening the iron|nail'd door, you are convinced by a flight of birds about your ears, and a cloud of du&s;t in your eyes, that it is the Pigeon-hou&s;e. If you come into the chapel, you find its altars, like tho&s;e of the Ancients, continually &s;moak|ing, but it is with the &s;teams of the adjoining kitchin.</P>
<P>The great hall within is high and &s;pacious, flank'd on one &s;ide with a very long table, a true image of ancient ho&s;pitality: the walls are all over ornamented with mon&s;trous horns of animals, about twenty broken pikes, ten or a dozen blunderbu&s;&s;es, and a ru&s;ty matchlock
<PB N="346" REF="380">
mu&s;quet or two, which we were inform'd had &s;erv'd in the civil wars. Here is one va&s;t arch'd window beautifully darken'd with divers &s;cut|cheons of painted gla&s;s: one &s;hining pane in particular bears date 1286, which alone pre|&s;erves the memory of a Knight who&s;e iron ar|mour is long &s;ince peri&s;hed with ru&s;t, and who&s;e alaba&s;ter no&s;e is moulder'd from his monument. The face of dame Eleanor in another piece owes more to that &s;ingle pane than to all the gla&s;&s;es &s;he ever con&s;ulted in her life. After this, who can &s;ay that gla&s;s is frail, when it is not half &s;o frail as human beauty, or glory! and yet I can't but &s;igh to think that the mo&s;t authentic record of &s;o ancient a family &s;hould lie at the mercy of every infant who flings a &s;tone. In former days there have dined in this hall gar|ter'd Knights, and courtly Dames, attended by u&s;hers, &s;ewers, and &s;ene&s;chals; and yet it was but la&s;t night, that an owl flew hither and mi&s;|took it for a barn.</P>
<P>This hall lets you (up and down) over a very high thre&s;hold into the great parlour. Its con|tents are a broken-belly'd virginal, a couple of cripled velvet chairs, with two or three mill|dew'd pictures of mouldy ance&s;tors, who look as di&s;mally as if they came fre&s;h from hell with all their brim&s;tone about them; the&s;e are care|fully &s;et at the farther corner, for the windows
<PB N="347" REF="381">
being every where broken make it &s;o convenient a place to dry poppies and mu&s;tard &s;eed, that the room is appropriated to that u&s;e.</P>
<P>Next this parlour, as I &s;aid before, lies the pigeon-hou&s;e, by the &s;ide of which runs an en|try, which lets you on one hand and t'other in|to a bed-chamber, a buttery, and a &s;mall hole call'd the chaplain's &s;tudy: then follow a brew|hou&s;e, a little green and gilt parlour, and the great &s;tairs, under which is the dairy; a little farther on the right the &s;ervants hall, and by the &s;ide of it up &s;ix &s;teps, the old lady's clo&s;et for her private devotions; which has a lettice into the hall, intended (as we imagine) that at &s;ame time as &s;he pray'd, &s;he might have an eye on the men and maids. There are upon the ground-floor in all twenty &s;ix apartments, among which I mu&s;t not forget a chamber which has in it a large Antiquity of timber, that &s;eems to have been either a bed&s;tead, or a cy|der-pre&s;s.</P>
<P>The kitchen is built in form of the Rotunda, being one va&s;t vault to the top of the Hou&s;e; where one overture &s;erves to let out the &s;moke, and let in the light. By the blackne&s;s of the walls, the circular fires, va&s;t cauldrons, yawn|ing mouths of ovens and furnaces, you would think it either the forge of Vulcan, the cave of Polypheme, or the temple of Moloch. The
<PB N="348" REF="382">
horror of this place has made &s;uch an impre&s;|&s;ion on the country people, that they believe the Witches keep their Sabbath here, and that once a year the Devil treats them with infernal veni&s;on, a roa&s;ted Tiger &s;tuff'd with ten-penny nails.</P>
<P>Above &s;tairs we have a number of rooms: you never pa&s;s out of one into another but by the a&s;cent or de&s;cent of two or three &s;tairs. Our be&s;t room is very long and low, of the exact proportion of a Band-box. In mo&s;t of the&s;e rooms there are hangings of the fine&s;t work in the world, that is to &s;ay, tho&s;e which Arachne &s;pins from her own bowels. Were it not for this only furniture, the whole would be a mi&s;erable &s;cene of naked walls, flaw'd cielings, broken windows, and ru&s;ty locks. The roof is &s;o de|cay'd, that after a favourable &s;hower we may expect a crop of mu&s;hrooms between the chinks of our floors. All the doors are as little and low as tho&s;e to the cabbins of Packet-boats. The&s;e rooms have for many years had no other inha|bitants than certain rats, who&s;e very age renders them worthy of this Seat, for the very rats of this venerable hou&s;e are grey: &s;ince the&s;e have not yet quitted it, we hope at lea&s;t that this an|cient man&s;ion may not fall during the &s;mall remnant the&s;e poor animals have to live, who are now too infirm to remove to another. There
<PB N="349" REF="383">
is yet a &s;mall &s;ub&s;i&s;tance left them in the few remaining books of the Library.</P>
<P>We had never &s;een half what I had de&s;cribed, but for a &s;tarch'd grey-headed Steward, who is as much an antiquity as any in this place, and looks like an old family picture walked out of its frame. He entertain'd us as we pa&s;s'd from room to room with &s;everal relations of the fa|mily; but his ob&s;ervations were particularly cu|rious when we came to the cellar: he inform|ed us where &s;tood the triple rows of buts of &s;ack, and where were ranged the bottles of tent, for toa&s;ts in a morning; he pointed to the &s;tands that &s;upported the iron-hoop'd hog&s;heads of &s;trong beer; then &s;tepping to a corner, he lugg'd out the tatter'd fragments of an unframed pic|ture; <Q>&startq;This (&s;ays he, with tears) was poor Sir Thomas! once ma&s;ter of all this drink. He had two &s;ons, poor young ma&s;ters! who ne|ver arrived to the age of his beer; they both fell ill in this very room, and never went out on their own legs.&endq;</Q> He could not pa&s;s by a heap of broken bottles without taking up a piece, to &s;how us the Arms of the family upon it. He then led us up the Tower by dark wind|ing &s;tone &s;teps, which landed us into &s;everal lit|tle rooms one above another. One of the&s;e was nail'd up, and our guide whi&s;per'd to us as a &s;ecret the occa&s;ion of it: It &s;eems the cour&s;e of
<PB N="350" REF="384">
this noble blood was a little interrupted about two centuries ago, by a freak of the lady Frances, who was here taken in the fact with a neigh|bouring Prior, ever &s;ince which the room has been nailed up, and branded with the name of the Adultery-Chamber. The gho&s;t of lady Frances is &s;uppo&s;ed to walk there, and &s;ome prying maids of the family report that they have &s;een a lady in a fardingale through the key-hole; but this matter is hu&s;ht up, and the &s;ervants are forbid to talk of it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t needs have tired you by this long de|&s;cription: but what engaged me in it, was a generous principle to pre&s;erve the memory of that, which it&s;elf mu&s;t &s;oon fall into du&s;t, nay perhaps part of it, before this letter reaches your hands.</P>
<P>Indeed we owe this old hou&s;e the &s;ame kind of gratitude that we do to an old friend, who harbours us in his declining condition, nay even in his la&s;t extremities. How fit is this retreat for uninterrupted &s;tudy, where no one that pa&s;&s;es by can dream there is an inhabitant, and even tho&s;e who would dine with us dare not &s;tay under our roof! Any one that &s;ees it will own I could not have cho&s;en a more likely place to con|ver&s;e with the dead in. I had been mad indeed if I had left your Grace for any one but Homer. But when I return to the living, I &s;hall have
<PB N="351" REF="385">
the &s;en&s;e to endeavour to conver&s;e with the be&s;t of them, and &s;hall therefore as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible tell you in per&s;on how much I am, &amp;c.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The D. of BUCKINGHAM to Mr. POPE.</HEAD>
<P>YOU de&s;ire my opinion as to the late di&s;|pute in France concerning Homer: And I think it excu&s;able (at an age alas! of not much plea&s;ure) to amu&s;e my&s;elf a little in taking no|tice of a controver&s;y, than which nothing is at pre&s;ent more remarkable (even in a nation who value them&s;elves &s;o much upon the Belles Let|tres) both on account of the illu&s;trious &s;ubject of it, and of the two per&s;ons, ingaged in the quarrel.</P>
<P>The one is extraordinary in all the Lyric kind of Poetry, even in the opinion of his very adver&s;ary. The other a Lady (and of more value for being &s;o) not only of great Learn|ing, but with a Genius admirably turn'd to that &s;ort of it which mo&s;t becomes her Sex for &s;oftne&s;s, genteelne&s;s, and promoting of virtue; and &s;uch as (one would think) is not &s;o liable as other parts of &s;cholar&s;hip, to rough di&s;putes, or violent animo&s;ity.</P>
<P><PB N="352" REF="386">
Yet it has &s;o happen'd, that no writers, even about Divinity it&s;elf, have been more out|ragious or uncharitable than the&s;e two polite authors; by &s;uffering their judgments to be a little warped (if I may u&s;e that expre&s;&s;ion) by the heat of their eager inclinations, to attack or defend &s;o great an Author under debate. I wi&s;h for the &s;ake of the public, which is now &s;o well entertained by their quarrel, it may not end at la&s;t in their agreeing to blame a third man who is &s;o pre&s;umptuous as to cen&s;ure both, if they &s;hould chance to hear of it.</P>
<P>To begin with matter of fact. M. D'Acier has well judg'd, that the be&s;t of all Poets cer|tainly de&s;erved a better tran&s;lation, at lea&s;t into French pro&s;e, becau&s;e to &s;ee it done in ver&s;e was de&s;pair'd of: I believe indeed, from a defect in that language, incapable of mounting to any degree of excellence &s;uitable to &s;o very great an undertaking.</P>
<P>She has not only perform'd this ta&s;k as well as pro&s;e can do it, (which is indeed but as the wrong &s;ide of tape&s;try is able to repre&s;ent the right <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">A thought of Cervantes.</NOTE>) &s;he has added to it al&s;o many learned and u&s;eful annotations. With all which &s;he mo&s;t obligingly delighted not only her own &s;ex, but mo&s;t of ours, ignorant of the Greek, and
<PB N="353" REF="387">
con&s;equently her adver&s;ary him&s;elf, who frank|ly acknowledges that ignorance.</P>
<P>'Tis no wonder therefore, if, in doing this, &s;he is grown &s;o enamour'd of that un&s;peakably-charming Author, as to have a kind of horror at the lea&s;t mention of a man bold enough to blame him.</P>
<P>Now as to M. de la Motte, he being already de&s;ervedly famous for all &s;orts of Lyric poetry, was &s;o far introduced by her into tho&s;e beauties of the Epic kind (tho' but in that way of tran&s;|lation) as not to re&s;i&s;t the plea&s;ure and hope of reputation, by attempting that in ver&s;e, which had been applauded &s;o much for the difficulty of doing it even in pro&s;e; knowing how this, well executed, mu&s;t extremely tran&s;cend the other.</P>
<P>But, as great Poets are a little apt to think they have an ancient right of being excus'd for vanity on all occa&s;ions, he was not content to out-do M. D'Acier, but endeavour'd to out-do Homer him&s;elf, and all that ever in any age or nation went before him in the &s;ame enterprize; by leaving out, altering, or adding whatever he thought be&s;t.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this pre&s;umptuous attempt, Homer has been in all times &s;o well defended, as not to need my &s;mall a&s;&s;i&s;tance; yet, I mu&s;t needs &s;ay, his excellencies are &s;uch, that for their &s;akes

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="353" REF="389">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE">
<PB N="354" REF="390">
he de&s;erves a much gentler touch for his &s;eem|ing errors. The&s;e if M. de la Motte had tran&s;|lated as well as the re&s;t, with an apology for having retain'd them only out of meer venera|tion; his judgment, in my opinion, would have appear'd much greater than by the be&s;t of his alterations, though I admit them to be written very finely. I join with M. de la Motte in wondering at &s;ome odd things in Homer, but 'tis chiefly becau&s;e of his &s;ublime ones, I was about to &s;ay his divine ones, which almo&s;t &s;ur|prize me at finding him any where in the falli|ble condition of human nature.</P>
<P>And now we are wondering, I am in a diffi|culty to gue&s;s what can be the rea&s;on of the&s;e exceptions again&s;t Homer, from one who has him&s;elf tran&s;lated him, contrary to the general cu&s;tom of tran&s;lators. Is there not a little of that in it? I mean to be &s;ingular, in getting above the title of a Tran&s;lator, tho' &s;ufficiently ho|nourable in this ca&s;e. For &s;uch an ambition no body has le&s;s occa&s;ion, than one who is &s;o fine a Poet in other kinds; and who mu&s;t have too much wit to believe, any alteration of an|other can intitle him to the denomination of an <HI>Epic Poet</HI> him&s;elf: tho' no man in this age &s;eems more capable of being a good one, if the French tongue would bear it. Yet in his tran&s;|lation he has done too well, to leave any doubt
<PB N="355" REF="391">
(with all his faults) that her's can be ever par|allel'd with it.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides he could not be ignorant, that find|ing faults is the mo&s;t ea&s;y and vulgar part of a critic; whereas nothing &s;hews &s;o much &s;kill and ta&s;te both, as the being throughly &s;en&s;ible of the &s;ublime&s;t excellencies.</P>
<P>What can we &s;ay in excu&s;e of all this? <HI>Hu|manum e&s;t errare:</HI> Since as good a Poet as, I be|lieve, the French language is capable of, and as &s;harp a Critic as any nation can produce, has by too much cen&s;uring Homer &s;ubjected a tran&s;|lation to cen&s;ure, that would have otherwi&s;e &s;tood the te&s;t of the &s;evere&s;t adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>But &s;ince he would needs chu&s;e that wrong way of critici&s;m, I wonder he mi&s;s'd a &s;tone &s;o ea&s;y to be thrown again&s;t Homer, not for his filling the Iliad with &s;o much flaughter (for that is to be excu&s;ed, &s;ince a War is not capable of being de&s;cribed without it) but with &s;o many various particulars of wounds and horror, as &s;hew the writer (I am afraid) &s;o delighted that way him|&s;elf, as not the lea&s;t to doubt his reader being &s;o al&s;o. Like Spanioletta, who&s;e di&s;mal pic|tures are the more di&s;agreeable for being always &s;o very movingly painted. Even Hector's la&s;t parting from his &s;on and Andromache hardly makes us amends for his body's being dragg'd thrice round the town. M. de la Motte in his
<PB N="356" REF="392">
&s;tronge&s;t objection about that di&s;mal combat, has &s;ufficient cau&s;e to blame his inraged adver|&s;ary; who here gives an in&s;tance that it is im|po&s;&s;ible to be violent without committing &s;ome mi&s;take; her pa&s;&s;ion for Homer blinding her too much to perceive the very gro&s;&s;e&s;t of his failings. By which warning I am become a lit|tle more capable of impartiality, though in a di&s;pute about that very Poet for whom I have the greate&s;t veneration.</P>
<P>M. D'Acier might have con&s;ider'd a little, that whatever were the motives of M. de la Motte to &s;o bold a proceeding, it could not darken that fame which I am &s;ure &s;he thinks &s;hines &s;ecurely even after the vain attempts of Plato him&s;elf again&s;t it: caus'd only perhaps by a like rea&s;on with that of Madam D'Acier's anger again&s;t M. de la Motte, namely, the finding that in pro&s;e his genius (great as it was) could not be capable of the &s;ublime heights of poetry, which therefore he bani&s;h'd out of his common-wealth.</P>
<P>Nor were the&s;e objections to Homer any more le&s;&s;ening of her merit in tran&s;lating him as well as that way is capable of, viz. fully, plainly, and elegantly, than the mo&s;t admira|ble ver&s;es can be any di&s;paragement to as ex|cellent pro&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="393">
The be&s;t excu&s;e for all this violence is, its being in a cau&s;e which gives a kind of reputa|tion even to &s;uffering, notwith&s;tanding ever &s;o ill a management of it.</P>
<P>The wor&s;t of defending even Homer in &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ionate manner, is its being more a proof of her weakne&s;s, than of his being liable to none. For what is it can excu&s;e Homer any more than Hector, for flying at the fir&s;t &s;ight of Achilles? who&s;e terrible a&s;pect &s;ure needed not &s;uch an inexcu&s;able fright to &s;et it off; and methinks all that account of Minerva's re&s;toring his dart to Achilles, comes a little too late, for excu&s;ing Hector's &s;o terrible apprehen&s;ion at the very fir&s;t.</P>

<P>I Am much honour'd by your Grace's com|pliance with my reque&s;t, in giving me your opinion of the French di&s;pute concerning Ho|mer. And I &s;hall keep my word, in fairly tel|ling wherein I di&s;agree from you. It is but in two or three very &s;mall points, not &s;o much of the di&s;pute, as of the parties concern'd in it. I
<PB N="358" REF="394">
cannot think quite &s;o highly of the Lady's learning, tho' I re&s;pect it very much. It is great complai&s;ance in that polite nation, to al|low her to be a Critic of equal rank with her hu&s;band. To in&s;tance no further, his remarks on Horace &s;hew more good Sen&s;e, Penetration, and a better Ta&s;te of his author, and tho&s;e up|on Ari&s;totle's Art of poetry more Skill and Science, than any of her's on any author what|ever <NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">This is a ju&s;t Character of that excellent Critic.</NOTE>. In truth, they are much more &s;light, dwell more in generals, and are, be&s;ides, for the mo&s;t part le&s;s her own; of which her Remarks upon Homer are an example, where Eu&s;tathius is tran&s;cribed ten times for once that he is quoted. Nor is there at all more depth of learning in tho&s;e upon Terence, Plautus, (or where they were mo&s;t wanted) upon Ari&s;tophanes, only the Greek &s;$holia upon the latter are &s;ome of the be&s;t extant.</P>
<P>Your Grace will believe me, that I did not &s;earch to find defects in a Lady; my employ|ment upon the Iliad forced me to &s;ee them; yet I have had &s;o much of the French complai&s;ance as to conceal her thefts; for wherever I have found her notes to be wholly another's (which is the ca&s;e in &s;ome hundreds) I have barely quoted the true Proprietor without ob&s;erving upon it. If Madam Dacier has ever &s;een my
<PB N="359" REF="395">
ob&s;ervations, &s;he will be &s;en&s;ible of this con|duct, but what effect it may have upon a Lady, I will not an&s;wer for.</P>
<P>In the next place, as to M. de la Motte, I think your Grace hardly does him right, in &s;up|po&s;ing he could have no Idea of the beauties of Homer's Epic Poetry, but what he learn'd from Madam Dacier's Pro&s;e-tran&s;lation. There had been a very elegant Pro&s;e-tran&s;lation before, that of Mon&s;ieur de la Valterie; &s;o elegant, that the &s;tyle of it was evidently the original and model of the famous Telemaque. Your Grace very ju&s;tly animadverts again&s;t the too great di&s;po|&s;ition of finding faults, in the one, and of con|fe&s;&s;ing none in the other: But doubtle&s;s, as to Violence, the Lady has infinitely the better of the Gentleman. Nothing can be more polite, di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate, or &s;en&s;ible, than M. de la Motte's manner of managing the di&s;pute: and &s;o much as I &s;ee your Grace admires the beauty of his ver&s;e (in which you have the &s;uffrage too of the Archbi&s;hop of Cambray) I will venture to &s;ay, his pro&s;e is full as good. I think therefore when you &s;ay, no di&s;putants even in Divinity could be more outragious and uncharitable than the&s;e two authors, you are a little too hard upon M. de la Motte. Not but that (with your Grace) I doubt as little of the zeal of Commentators as of the zeal of Divines, and am as ready to be|lieve
<PB N="360" REF="396">
of the pa&s;&s;ions and pride of mankind in general, that (did but the &s;ame intere&s;ts go along with them) they would carry the learn|ed world to as violent extremes, animo&s;ities, and even per&s;ecutions, about variety of opini|ons in Critici&s;m, as ever they did about Reli|gion: and that, in defect of Scripture to quarrel upon, we &s;hould have French, Italian, and Dutch Commentators ready to burn one another about Homer, Virgil, Terence, and Horace.</P>
<P>I do not wonder your Grace is &s;hock'd at the flight of Hector upon the fir&s;t appearance of Achilles in the twenty-&s;econd Iliad. However (to &s;hew my&s;elf a true Commentator, if not a true Critic) I will endeavour to excu&s;e, if not to defend it in my Notes on that book. And to &s;ave my&s;elf what trouble I can, in&s;tead of doing it in this letter, I will draw up the &s;ub|&s;tance of what I have to &s;ay for it in a &s;eparate paper, which I'll &s;hew your Grace when next we meet. I will only de&s;ire you to allow me, that Hector was in an ab&s;olute certainty of death, and depre&s;s'd over and above with the con&s;cience of being in an ill cau&s;e. If your heart be &s;o great, as not to grant the fir&s;t of the&s;e will &s;ink the &s;pirit of a Hero, you'll at lea&s;t be &s;o good, as to allow the &s;econd may.

My own time has been more melancholy, &s;pent in an attendance upon death, which has &s;eized one of our family: my mother is &s;omething better, though at her advanced age every day is a climacteric. There was joined to this an in|di&s;po&s;ition of my own, which I ought to look upon as a &s;light one compared with my mother's becau&s;e my life is not of half the con&s;equence to any body that her's is to me.

<P>The article you enquire of, is of as little concern to me as you de&s;ire it &s;hould; namely the railing papers about the Ody&s;&s;ey. If the book has merit, it will extingui&s;h all &s;uch na&s;ty &s;candal; as the Sun puts an end to &s;tinks, mere|ly by coming out.</P>

Not but malice and inju&s;tice have their day, like &s;ome poor &s;hort-lived vermine that die in &s;hooting their own &s;tings. Fal&s;hood is Folly (&s;ays Homer) and liars and calumniators at la&s;t hurt none but them&s;elves, even in this world: in the next, 'tis charity to &s;ay, God have mercy on them! they

<P>Net to trouble you at present with a $$cital of all my Obligations to you, I shall only mention $oe things, which Stake particularly kind of you: your desire that I should write to you, and your proposal of giving me twenty Guineas to change my Religion, which last you must give me leave $e make the subject of this Letter.</P>
<P>Sure $word$ Clergyman $ver offered so much out of his own purse for the sake of any Religion. $is al|most as many pieces of Gold, as an Apostle could get of Silver from the priests of old, $n a much more valuable consideration. I believe it will be better worth my white to propose a change of my Faith by &s;ubscription, than a tran&s;lation of Homer. And $word$ convince you, how well disposed I am to the re|formation, I shall be content, if you can prevail with my Lord Treasurer, and the ministry, to rise to the same Sum, each of them, on this pious account, as my Lord Hallifax has done on the pr$phane one. I am afraid there's no being at once a poet and a good Christian, and I am very much strai$ned
<PB N="370" REF="406">
between two, while the Whigs seem willing to contri|bute as much, to continue me the one as you would to make me the other. But, if you can move every man in the Government, who has above ten thou|sand pounds a Year, to subscribe as much as your|self, I shall become a convert, as most men do, when the Lord turns it to my Interest. I know they have the truth of Religion so much at Heart, that they'd certainly give more to have one good sub|ject, translated from Popery to the Church of Eng|land, than twenty heathenish authors out of any unknown tongue into ours. I therefore commi&s;sion you, M^r. Dean, with full authority, to transact this affair in my name, and to propose as f$llo$s. First, that as to the head of our Church, the Pope, I may engage to renounce his power, whensoever I shall receive any particular indulg$ncies from the head of your Church, the Queen.</P>
<P>As to communion in one kind, I shall also promise to change it for communion in both; as soon as the Ministry will allow me.</P>
<P>For invocations to Saints, mine shall be turned to dedications to sinners, when I shall find the great ones of this World as willing to do me any good, as I believe those of the other are.</P>
<P>You see I shall not be obstinate in the main points;
<PB N="371" REF="407" MS="Y">
but there is one article I must reserve, and which you seemed not unwilling to allow me, prayer for the dead. There are people to whose Souls I wish as well, as to my own; and I must $rave leave, humbly to lay before them, that though the &s;ubscriptions abovementioned will suffice for myself, there are nece&s;sary perquisites and Additions, which I must demand on the score of this charitable arti|cle. It is also to be considered, that the greater part of those, whose Souls I am most concerned for, were unfortunately hereties, $$hismaties, poets, painters, or persons of such lives and manners, as few or no Churches are willing to save. The expence will therefore be the greater, to make an effectual provision for the said Souls.</P>
<P>Old Dryden, though a Roman Catholic, was a Poet, and 'tis revealed in the visions of some anci|ent Saints, that no Poet was ever saved under some hundred of Ma&s;ses. I cannot set his delivery from purgatory at le&s;s than fifty Pounds Sterling.</P>
<P>Walsh was not only a Soci$$an, but (what you'll own is harder to be saved) a $hig. He cannot modestly be rated at le&s;s than an hundred.</P>
<P>L'Estrange, being a Jory, we compute him but at twenty Pounds which $o friend of the party can deny to give, to keep him from damning in
<PB N="372" REF="408">
the next life, considering they never gave him Six|pence to keep him from $arving in this.</P>
<P>All this together amounts to one hundred and seventy pounds.</P>
<P>In the next place, I must desire you to represent, that there are several of my friends yet living, when I design, God willing, to $word$ in consi|deration of Legacies; out of which it is a doctrine in the reformed Church, that not a farthing shall be allowed to save their Souls who gave them.</P>
<P>There is one **** who will dye within these few months, with ****** one M^r. $erras, who hath grievously offended in making the likene&s;s of almost all things in heaven above and earth below. And one M^r. Gay, an unhappy Youth, who writes pas|terals during the time of divine service, whose case is the more deplerable, as he hath miserably lavish|ed away all that silver he should have reserved for his Soul's health, in buttons and loops for his Coat.</P>
<P>I can't pretend, to have these people honestly saved un|der some hundred pounds, whether you consider the difficulty of such a work, or the extreme love and ten|derne&s;s I bear them, which will infallibly make me push this Charity as far as I am able. There is but one more whose salvation I insist upon, and then I have done: but indeed it may prove of so much
<PB N="373" REF="409">
greater charge than all the rest, that I will only lay the Case before you and the ministry, and lay to their prudence and generosity, what sum they shall think fit to b$ston upon it.</P>
<P>The person I mean, is D^r. Swift; a dignified cler|gyman, butone, who, by his own confe&s;sion, has composed m$r$ libels than sermons. If it be true, what I have heard often affirm'd by innocent peo|ple, That too much wit is dangerous to salvation, this unfortunate Gentleman must certainly be damned to all $t$rnity. But, I hope his long experi|ence in the world, and frequent conversation with great men, will cause him (as it has some others) to have le&s;s and le&s;s wit every day. Be it as it will, I should not think my own Soul deserved to be saved, if I did not endeavour to save his; for I have all the Obligations in nature to him. He has brought me into better company than I cared for, made me merrier when I was sick than I had a mind to be, and put me upon making poems on purpose, that he might alter them $word$.</P>
<P>$$nc$ thought I could never have discharged my debt to his kindne&s;s, but have lately been informed, to my unspeakable comfort that I have more than paid it all. For Monsieur de Montagne has a&s;sured me, "that the person who receives a
<PB N="374" REF="410">
benefit obliges the giver:" for since the chief endea|vour of one friend is to do good to the other, he who administers both the matter and occa&s;ion is the&mdash;man who is liberal. At this rate it is impo&s;sible D^r. Swift should be $v$r out of my debt, as matters stand already: and for the future, he may expect daily more obligations from</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">To a Lady, in the Name of her Brother.</HEAD>
<P>IF you have not a cha&s;te Ear, and a pure Heart, do not peru&s;e this Letter; for as <HI>Jeremy Taylor</HI> &s;ays, in his <HI>Holy Living and Dying,</HI> the fir&s;t thing a Virgin ought to endeavour, is to be ignorant of the <HI>Di&s;tinction</HI> of <HI>Sexes.</HI></P>
<P>It is in the Confidence I have, that you are thus inno|cent, that I endeavour to gratify your Curio&s;ity, in a Point which I am &s;en&s;ible none but a Brother could do with Decency.</P>
<P>I &s;hall entertain you with the mo&s;t reigning Curio&s;ity in the Town, I mean a Per&s;on who is equally the Toa&s;t of Gentlemen and Ladies, and is at pre&s;ent more uni|ver&s;ally admired than any of either Sex: You know few Proficients have a greater Genius for Mon&s;ters than my|&s;elf; but I never ta&s;ted a Mon&s;ter to that Degree I have done this Creature: It was not, like other Mon&s;ters, produced in the De&s;erts of <HI>Arabia,</HI> nor come from the Country of the <HI>Great Mogul,</HI> but is the Production of the Joint endeavours of a <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Par&s;on and his Spou&s;e, who intended, in the Singlene&s;s of Heart, to have begot a Chri&s;tian but of one Sex, and Providence has &s;ent them one of two.</P>
<P>There are various Opinions concerning the Creature about Town; Mr. <HI>Cromwell</HI> ob&s;erves, that the Age is very licentious, and the pre&s;ent Reign very lewd and corrupt, in permitting a Lady, <HI>by Authority,</HI> (as appears by the printed Bills) to expo&s;e her per&s;onal Curio&s;ities for a Shilling.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="412">
Mr. <HI>P.</HI> looks upon it as a Prodigy portending &s;ome great Revolution in the State: To &s;trengthen which Opi|nion, he produces the following Prophecy of <HI>No&s;trada|mus,</HI> which he explains politically.</P>
<LG>
<L>When as two Sexes join'd in one,</L>
<L>Shall in the Realm of <HI>Brute</HI> be &s;hewn;</L>
<L>Than Factions &s;hall unite, if I know,</L>
<L>To choo&s;e a Prince <HI>Jure Divino.</HI></L>
<L>This Prodigy of common Gender,</L>
<L>Is neither Sex, but a Pretender,</L>
<L>So the Lord &s;hield the Faith's Defender.</L>
</LG>
<P>Mrs. <HI>N</HI>&mdash;admires what People wonder at &s;o much, and &s;ays $he is ju&s;t &s;o her&s;elf: the Dutche&s;s of <HI>S</HI>&mdash;is of the &s;ame Opinion.</P>
<P>Among the&s;e various Conjectures, that I might be informed of the Truth, I took along with me a Phy&s;ici|an and a Divine; the one to in&s;pect the State of its Body, the other to examine that of its Mind: The Per&s;ons I made choice of, were the ingenious Dr. <HI>P</HI>&mdash;and the Reverend Mr.&mdash;. We were no &s;ooner in the Room, but the Party came to us, dre&s;s'd in that Habit in which the Ladies affect an Hermophroditical Imitation of Men&mdash;Your &s;harp Wit, my dear Si&s;ter, will immediately conclude that I mean a Riding-Habit.</P>
<P>I think it not material to inform you, whether the Doctor, the Divine, or my&s;elf looked fir&s;t. The Prie&s;t you will maliciou&s;ly fancy was in his Nature mo&s;t an Infidel, and doubted mo&s;t of this Miracle: We there|fore propo&s;ed to him to take the &s;ure&s;t Method of believ|ing, &s;eeing, and feeling: He complied with both Ad|monitions; and having taken a large Pinch of Snuff upon it, advi&s;ed us with a Nod, that we &s;hould by no
<PB N="20" REF="413">
means regard it as a Female, but as a Male; for by &s;o doing, we &s;hould be guilty of le&s;s Sinfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>The Doctor, upon In&s;pection, differed from this Opi|nion; he would by no means allow it a Miracle, or at mo&s;t a natural one: He &s;aid, upon the whole, it was a Woman; that whatever might give a Handle to think otherwi&s;e, was a Trifle, nothing being more common than for a Child to be marked with that thing which the Mother longed for.</P>
<P>As for this Party's Temper of Mind, it appears to be a mo&s;t even Di&s;po&s;ition, partaking of the good Qualities of both Sexes; for &s;he is neither &s;o inacce&s;&s;ible as other Ladies, nor is he &s;o impudent as other Gentlemen: Of how obliging and complai&s;ant a Turn appears by this, that he tells the Ladies he has the Inclinations of a Gen|tleman, and that &s;he tells the Gentlemen &s;he has the <HI>Tendre</HI> of a Lady. As a further Proof of this affable Di&s;po&s;ition, he formerly received Vi&s;its of the fair Sex in their Ma&s;ques, till an impertinent Fellow in a female Di&s;gui&s;e mingled with a Party of Ladies, and impudent|ly overheard their improving Speculations.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding this, &s;he civilly promi&s;ed at my Re|que&s;t, that my two Si&s;ters &s;hould be admitted privately, whenever you wou'd do her the Honour of your Con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>How agreeable &s;oever this Sight has been to me, I a&s;&s;ure you it cannot be &s;o plea&s;ing as the Sight of you in Town, and whatever you may &s;ee in the Country, I dare affirm, no Man or Woman can &s;hew you the like.</P>
<P>I therefore earne&s;tly de&s;ire you to make ha&s;te to this Place; for tho' indeed like mo&s;t other Brothers, I &s;hould be &s;orry you were married at my Expence, yet
<PB N="21" REF="414">
I would by no Means, like them, detain you in the Country from your Admirers; for, you may believe me, no Brother in the World ever lov'd a Si&s;ter as I do you.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<P>I Will not de&s;cribe <HI>Bl</HI>&mdash;in particular, not to fore&s;tal your Expectations before you &s;ee it: Only take a &s;hort Account, which, I will hazard my little Credit, is no unju&s;t one. I never &s;aw &s;o great a thing with &s;o much Littlene&s;s in it: I think the Architect built it entirely in Complai&s;ance to the Ta&s;te of its Owners: For it is the mo&s;t inho&s;pitable thing imagin|able, and the mo&s;t &s;elfi&s;h: It has, like their own Hearts, no room for Strangers, and no Reception for any Per|&s;on of &s;uperior Quality to them&s;elves. There are but ju&s;t two Apartments, for the Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, be|low; and but two Apartments above, (very much in|ferior to them) in the whole Hou&s;e. When you look upon the Out&s;ide, you'd think it large enough for a Prince; when you &s;ee the In&s;ide, it is too little for a Subject; and has not Conveniency to lodge a com|mon Family. It is a Hou&s;e of Entries and Pa&s;&s;ages; among which there are three Vi&s;ta's thro' the whole, very u&s;ele&s;sly hand&s;ome. There is what might have been a fine Gallery, but &s;poil'd by two Arches to|wards the End of it, which take away the Sight of &s;e|veral of the Windows. There are two ordinary Stair|ca&s;es in&s;tead of one great one. The be&s;t Things, with|in the Hou&s;e, are the Hall, which is indeed noble and well proportioned; and the Cellars and Offices under|ground, which are the mo&s;t commodious, and the be&s;t contrived of the whole. At the Top of the Building
<PB N="23" REF="416">
are &s;everal Cupola's and little Turrets that have but an ill E&s;&s;ect, and make the Building look at once finical and heavy. What &s;eems of the be&s;t Ta&s;te, is that Front towards the Gardens, which is not yet loaded with the&s;e Turrets. The two Sides of the Building are entirely &s;poiled by two mon&s;trous Bow-windows, which &s;tand ju&s;t in the middle, in&s;tead of Doors: And as if it were fatal, that &s;ome trifling Littlene&s;s &s;hould every where de&s;troy the Grandeur, there are in the chief Front two Semi-circles of a lower Structure than the re&s;t, that cut off the Angles, and look as if they were purpo&s;ely de|&s;igned to hide a loftier and nobler Piece of Building, the Top of which appears above them. In a Word, the whole is a mo&s;t expen&s;ive Ab&s;urdity; and the Duke of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> gave a true Character of it, when he &s;aid, it was a great <HI>Quarry of Stones above Ground.</HI></P>
<P>We paid a vi&s;it to the Spring, where <HI>Ro&s;amond</HI> bathed her&s;elf; on a Hill where remains only a Piece of a Wall of the old Palace of <HI>Henry</HI> II.
