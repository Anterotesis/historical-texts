THE Political Hi&s;tory OF THE DEVIL, AS WELL ANCIENT as MODERN: IN TWO PARTS.</P>
<P>PART I. Containing a State of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Circum&s;tances, and the various Turns of his Affairs, from his Expul&s;ion out of Heaven, to the <HI>Creation</HI> of Man; with Remarks on the &s;everal Mi&s;takes concerning the Rea&s;on and Manner of his Fall. Al&s;o his Proceedings with <HI>Mankind</HI> ever &s;ince <HI>Adam,</HI> to the fir&s;t planting of the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion in the World.</P>
<P>PART II. Containing his more private Conduct, down to the pre&s;ent Times: His Government, his Ap|pearances, his Manner of Working, and the Tools he works with.</P>
<L><HI>Bad as he is, the Devil may be abus'd,</HI></L>
<L><HI>Be fal&s;ly charg'd, and cau&s;ele&s;ly accus'd,</HI></L>

<HEAD>As concerning a DEDICATION.</HEAD>
<P>IT is not the ea&s;ie&s;t Thing in the Ca&s;e before me to determine who has the mo&s;t Right to a Dedication of this Work.</P>
<P>Antient U&s;age would have directed a &s;olemn Author to addre&s;s the&s;e Sheets to the great Maje&s;ty of Heaven, in Congratulation of his glorious Victory over the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Angels; but I decline that Method as prophane.</P>
<P>The &s;ame Rea&s;ons forbids me ad|dre&s;&s;ing to him who conquer'd him on Earth, and who when the <HI>Devil</HI> was &s;o in&s;olent as to a&s;&s;ault him, made him fly like a vanqui&s;h'd Rebel, with but the Word, <HI>Get thee behind me.</HI></P>
<P>I had then &s;ome Thoughts of in&s;crib|ing it to <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf, but I did not really know how to reli&s;h holding a Par|lee with the Devil, and talking to him in the fir&s;t Per&s;on; nay, and as it were, ma|king<HI><PB REF="4"></HI>all my Readers do &s;o too; and be&s;ides, as I knew there was &s;o very little in the whole Work, that Satan would be plea&s;ed with; I was loth to Compliment him, while I was expo&s;|&s;ing him; which would be to imitate the very Hypocri&s;y by which he is di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd, and you might &s;ay, I play'd the <HI>Devil</HI> with the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e Difficulties pre&s;enting, I think the giving my Rea&s;ons for the ma|king no Dedication, is Dedication e|nough.</P>

<HEAD>THE POLITICAL HISTORY OF THE DEVIL, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Being an Introduction to the whole Work.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Doubt not but the title of this book will amu&s;e &s;ome of my reading friends a little at fir&s;t; they will make a pau&s;e, perhaps, as they do at a witch's prayer, and be &s;ome time a re&s;ol|ving whether they had be&s;t look into it or no, le&s;t they &s;hould really rai&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> by reading his &s;tory.</P>
<P>Children and old women have told them&s;elves &s;o many frightful things <HI>of the Devil,</HI> and have form'd ideas of him in their minds, in &s;o many horrible and mon&s;trous &s;hapes, that really it were enough to fright the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, to meet him&s;elf in the dark, dre&s;s'd up in the &s;everal figures which imagi|nation has form'd for him in the minds of men; and as for them&s;elves, I cannot think by any means that the <HI>Devil</HI> would terrify them half
<PB N="2" REF="10">
&s;o much, if they were to conver&s;e face to face with him.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t certainly therefore be a mo&s;t u&s;eful un|dertaking to give the true hi&s;tory of this <HI>Tyrant of the air,</HI> this <HI>God of the world,</HI> this terror and aver|&s;ion of mankind, which we call <HI>Devil;</HI> to &s;hew what he IS, and what he IS NOT, where he IS, and where he IS NOT, when he is IN US, and when he IS NOT; for I cannot doubt but that the <HI>Devil</HI> is really and <HI>bona fide</HI> in a great many of our ho|ne&s;t weak-headed friends, when they them&s;elves know nothing of the matter.</P>
<P>Nor is the work &s;o difficult as &s;ome may ima|gine. The <HI>Devil</HI>'s <HI>hi&s;tory</HI> is not &s;o hard to come at, as it &s;eems to be; his original and the fir&s;t ri&s;e of his family is upon record, and as for his con|duct, he has acted indeed in the dark, as to me|thod in many things; but <HI>in general,</HI> as cunning as he is, he has been fool enough to expo&s;e him|&s;elf in &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable tran&s;actions of his life, and has not &s;hewn him&s;elf a politi|cian at all: Our old friend <HI>Matchiavel</HI> outdid him in many things, and I may in the proce&s;s of this work give an account of &s;everal of the &s;ons of <HI>Adam,</HI> and &s;ome &s;ocieties of 'em too, who have out-witted <HI>the Devil,</HI> nay, who have out-&s;in'd <HI>the Devil,</HI> and that I think may be call'd out|&s;hooting him in his own bow.</P>
<P>It may perhaps be expected of me in this hi|&s;tory, that &s;ince I &s;eem inclin'd to &s;peak favoura|bly of <HI>Satan,</HI> to do him ju&s;tice, and to write his &s;tory impartially, I &s;hould take &s;ome pains to tell you what religion he is of; and even this part may not be &s;o much a je&s;t, as at fir&s;t &s;ight you may take it to be; for <HI>Satan</HI> has &s;omething of reli|gion in him, I a&s;&s;ure you; nor is he &s;uch an un|profitable <HI>Devil</HI> that way, as &s;ome may &s;uppo&s;e him to be; for tho', in reverence to my brethren,
<PB N="3" REF="11">
I will not reckon him among the Clergy; yet I can|not deny, but that he often preaches, and if it be not profitably to his hearers; 'tis as much their fault, as it is out of his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>It has indeed been &s;ugge&s;ted that he has taken orders, and that a certain Pope, famous for being an extraordinary favourite of his, gave him both in&s;titution and induction; but as this is not up|on record, and therefore we have no authentic document for the probation, I &s;hall not affirm it for a truth, for I would not &s;lander the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>It is &s;aid al&s;o, and I am apt to believe it, that he was very familiar with that holy father Pope <HI>Silve&s;|ter</HI> II. and &s;ome charge him with per&s;onating Pope <HI>Hildebrand</HI> the infamous, on an extraordinary oc|ca&s;ion, and him&s;elf &s;tting in the chair apo&s;tolick, in a full congregation; and you may hear more of this hereafter: But as I do not meet with Pope <HI>Diabolus</HI> among the li&s;t; in all father <HI>Platina</HI>'s lives of the Popes, &s;o I am willing to leave it as I find it.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak to the point, and a nice point it is I acknowledge; <HI>namely,</HI> what religion <HI>the Devil</HI> is of; my an&s;wer will indeed be general, yet not at all ambiguous, for I love to &s;peak po&s;itively and with undoubted evidence.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>He is a believer.</HI> And if in &s;aying &s;o it &s;hould follow that even the <HI>Devil</HI> has more religion than &s;ome of our men of fame can at this time be charged with, I hope my Lord&mdash;and his Grace the&mdash;of&mdash;and &s;ome of the upper cla&s;s in the red-hot club, will not wear the coat, however well it may &s;it to their &s;hapes, or challenge the Satyr, as if it were pointed at them, becau&s;e 'tis due to them: In a word, whatever their Lord&s;hips
<PB N="4" REF="12">
are, I can a&s;&s;ure them that the <HI>Devil</HI> is no Infidel.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>He fears God.</HI> We have &s;uch abundant evi|dence of this in &s;acred Hi&s;tory, that if I were not at pre&s;ent, in common with a few others, talking to an infidel &s;ort of Gentlemen, with whom tho&s;e remote things call'd Scriptures are not allow'd in evidence, I might &s;ay it were &s;ufficiently prov'd; but I doubt not in the proce&s;s of this undertaking to &s;hew, that <HI>the Devil</HI> really <HI>&s;ears God,</HI> and that after ano|ther manner than ever he fear'd Saint <HI>Francis</HI> or Saint <HI>Dun&s;tan;</HI> and if that be proved, as I take upon me to advance, I &s;hall leave it to judgment, who's the better Chri&s;tian, <HI>the Devil</HI> who believes and trembles, or our mo|dern gentry of&mdash;who believe neither <HI>God or Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus brought <HI>the Devil</HI> within the <HI>Pale,</HI> I &s;hall leave him among you for the pre&s;ent; not but that I may examine in its order who has the be&s;t claim to his brotherhood, the Papi&s;ts or the Prote&s;tants, and among the latter the Lutherans or the Calvini&s;ts, and &s;o de&s;cending to all the &s;everal denominations of churches, &s;ee who has le&s;s of <HI>the Devil</HI> in them, and who more; and whether <HI>le&s;s</HI> or <HI>more</HI> the Devil has not a &s;eat in every &s;yna|gogue, a pew in every church, a place in every pulpit, and a vote in every &s;ynod; even from the Sanhedrim of the <HI>Jews,</HI> to our friends at the <HI>Bull and Mouth,</HI> &amp;c. from the greate&s;t to the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>It will, I confe&s;s, come very much within the compa&s;s of this part of my di&s;cour&s;e, to give an ac|count, <HI>or at lea&s;t make an e&s;&s;ay towards it,</HI> of the &s;hare <HI>the Devil</HI> has had in the &s;preading religion
<PB N="5" REF="13">
in the world, and e&s;pecially of dividing and &s;ubdi|viding opinions in religion; perhaps, to eke it out and make it reach the farther; and al&s;o to &s;hew how far he is or has made him&s;elf a mi&s;&s;ionary of the famous clan <HI>de propaganda fide;</HI> it is true, we find him heartily employ'd in almo&s;t every cor|ner of the world <HI>ad propagandum errorem:</HI> But that may require a hi&s;tory by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>As to his propagating religion, 'tis a little hard indeed, at fir&s;t &s;ight, to charge <HI>the Devil</HI> with propagating religion, that is to &s;ay, if we take it literally, and in the gro&s;s; but if you take it as the <HI>Scots</HI> in&s;i&s;ted to take the oath of fidelity, <HI>viz.</HI> with an <HI>explanation,</HI> it is plain <HI>Satan</HI> has very often had a &s;hare in the method, if not in the de|&s;ign of propagating <HI>chri&s;tian faith:</HI> For example.</P>
<P>I think I do no injury at all to the Devil, to &s;ay that he had a great hand in the old holy war, as it was ignorantly and enthu&s;ia&s;tically call'd, and in &s;tirring up the chri&s;tian princes and powers of <HI>Europe</HI> to run a madding after the <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Sara|cens,</HI> and make war with tho&s;e innocent people above a thou&s;and miles off, only becau&s;e they entred in|to God's heritage when he had for&s;aken it, graz'd upon his ground when he had fairly turn'd it into a common, and laid it open for the next comer; &s;pending the nation's trea&s;ure, and embark|ing their kings and people, I &s;ay, in a war above a thou&s;and mile off, filling their heads with that religious madne&s;s, call'd, in tho&s;e days, <HI>holy zeal</HI> to recover the <HI>terra &s;ancta,</HI> the &s;epulchers of Chri&s;t and the Saints, and as they call'd it fal&s;ly, the <HI>holy city,</HI> tho' true religion &s;ays it was the accur&s;ed city, and not worth &s;pending one drop of blood for.</P>
<P>This religious <HI>Bubble</HI> was certainly of <HI>Satan,</HI> who, as he craftily drew them in, &s;o like a true <HI>Devil</HI> he left them in the lurch when they came there, fac'd about to the <HI>Saracens,</HI> animated the
<PB N="6" REF="14">
immortal <HI>Saladin</HI> again&s;t them, and manag'd &s;o dexterou&s;ly that he left the bones of about thir|teen or fourteen hundred thou&s;and Chri&s;tians there as a trophy of his infernal politicks; and after the chri&s;tian world had run <HI>a la &s;anta terra,</HI> or in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> a <HI>&s;aunt'ring</HI> about a hundred year, he dropt it to play another game le&s;s fooli&s;h, but ten times wickeder than that which went before it, <HI>namely,</HI> turning the cru&s;adoes of the Chri&s;tians one again&s;t another; and, as <HI>Hudibra&s;s</HI> &s;aid in another ca&s;e,</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Made them fight like mad or drunk&endq; For dame religion as for punk.</Q></P>
<P>Of this you have a compleat account in the hi&s;tory of the Popes decrees again&s;t the Count <HI>de Thoulou&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Walden&s;es</HI> and <HI>Albigen&s;es,</HI> with the cru&s;adoes and ma&s;&s;acres which follow'd upon them, wherein to do <HI>the Devil</HI>'s politicks &s;ome ju&s;tice, he met with all the &s;ucce&s;s he could de|&s;ire, and the zealots of that day executed his in|fernal orders mo&s;t punctually, and planted religi|on in tho&s;e countries in a glorious and triumphant manner, upon the de&s;truction of an infinite num|ber of innocent people, who&s;e blood has fatten'd the &s;oil for the growth of the catholick faith, in a manner very particular, and to Satan's full &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P>I might, to compleat this part of his hi&s;tory, give you the detail of his progre&s;s in the&s;e fir&s;t &s;teps of his alliances with <HI>Rome,</HI> and add a long li&s;t of ma&s;&s;acres, wars, and expeditions in behalf of religion, which he has had the honour to have a vi&s;ible hand in; &s;uch as the <HI>Pari&s;ian</HI> ma&s;&s;acre, the <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> war under the Duke <HI>d' Alva,</HI> the <HI>Smith|field</HI> fires in the <HI>Marian days</HI> in <HI>England,</HI> and the ma&s;&s;acres in <HI>Ireland;</HI> all which would mo&s;t effec|tually convince us that <HI>the Devil</HI> has not been
<PB N="7" REF="15">
idle in his bu&s;ine&s;s; but I may meet with the&s;e again in my way, 'tis enough, while I am upon the generals only, to mention them thus in a &s;um|mary way; I &s;ay, 'tis enough to prove that <HI>the Devil</HI> has really been as much concerned as any body, in the methods taken by &s;ome people for propagating the chri&s;tian religion in the world.</P>
<P>Some have ra&s;hly, and I had almo&s;t &s;aid mali|ciou&s;ly charg'd <HI>the Devil</HI> with the great triumphs of his friends the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> and would place the conque&s;t of <HI>Mexico</HI> and <HI>Peru</HI> to the cre|dit of his account.</P>
<P>But I cannot join with them in this at all, I mu&s;t &s;ay, I believe <HI>the Devil</HI> was innocent of that matter; my rea&s;on is, becau&s;e, <HI>Satan</HI> was never &s;uch a fool as to &s;pend his time, or his politicks, or embark his allies to conquer nations who were already his own; that would be <HI>Satan</HI> again&s;t <HI>Beelzebub,</HI> a making war upon him&s;elf, and at lea&s;t doing nothing to the purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>If they &s;hould charge him, indeed, with de|luding <HI>Philip</HI> II. of <HI>Spain</HI> into that propo&s;terous at|tempt call'd <HI>the Armada, (anglice,</HI> the <HI>Spani&s;h Inva|&s;ion,)</HI> I &s;hould indeed more readily join with them; but whether he did it weakly, in hope, <HI>which was indeed not likely,</HI> that it &s;hould &s;ucceed; or wick|edly, to de&s;troy the great fleet of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and draw them in within the reach of his own do|minions, the elements; this being a que&s;tion which authors differ exceedingly about, I &s;hall leave it to decide it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But the greate&s;t piece of management, which we find <HI>the Devil</HI> has concern'd him&s;elf in of late, in the matter of religion, &s;eems to be that of the mi&s;&s;ion into <HI>China,</HI> and here indeed <HI>Sathan</HI> has acted his ma&s;ter-piece: It was, no doubt, much for his &s;er|vice, that <HI>the Chine&s;es</HI> &s;hould have no in&s;ight in|to matters of religion, I mean, that we call chri&s;|tian;
<PB N="8" REF="16">
and therefore, tho' <HI>Popery</HI> and the <HI>Devil</HI> are not at &s;o much variance as &s;ome may imagine, yet he did not think it &s;afe to let the general &s;y&s;tem of Chri&s;tianity be heard of among them in <HI>China.</HI> Hence when the name of the chri&s;tian religion had but been received with &s;ome &s;eeming appro|bation in the country of <HI>Japan, Satan</HI> imme|diately, as if alarm'd at the thing, and dread|ing what the con&s;equence of it might be, arm'd the <HI>Japone&s;es</HI> again&s;t it with &s;uch fury, that they expell'd it at once.</P>
<P>It was much &s;afer to his de&s;igns, when, if the &s;tory be not a fiction, he put that <HI>Dutch</HI> witici&s;m into the mouths of the States commanders, when they came to <HI>Japan;</HI> who having more wit than to own them&s;elves Chri&s;tians in &s;uch a place as that, when the que&s;tion was put to them, an&s;wer|ed negatively, <HI>That they were not,</HI> but that <HI>they were of another religion call'd</HI> Hollanders.</P>
<P>However, it &s;eems the diligent <HI>Je&s;uits</HI> out-wit|ted the Devil in <HI>China,</HI> and, as I &s;aid above, over|&s;hot him in his own Bow; for the mi&s;&s;ion being in danger <HI>by the Devil and the</HI> Chine&s;e <HI>Emperor</HI>'s <HI>joining together,</HI> of being wholly expell'd there too, as they had been in <HI>Japan,</HI> they cunningly &s;ell in with the ecele&s;ia&s;ticks of the country, and joining the prie&s;tcraft of both religions together, they brought <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t</HI> and <HI>Confucius</HI> to be &s;o reconcilable, that the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Roman</HI> ido|latry appeared capable of a confederacy, of go|ing on hand in hand together, and con&s;equent|ly of being very good friends.</P>
<P>This was a ma&s;ter-piece indeed, and, <HI>as they &s;ay,</HI> almo&s;t frighted <HI>Satan</HI> out of his wits; but he being a ready mannager, and particularly fa|mous for &s;erving him&s;elf of the rogueries of the prie&s;ts, fac'd about immediately to the mi&s;&s;ion, and making a virtue of nece&s;&s;ity, clapt in, with

<P>Nor has it been much di&s;advantage to him that this plan or &s;cheme of a new modell'd religion would not go down at <HI>Rome,</HI> and that the Inqui|&s;ition damn'd it with Bell, Book and Candle; di&s;|tance of place &s;erv'd his new allies, the mi&s;&s;iona|ries, in the &s;tead of a protection from the Inqui|&s;ition; and now and then a rich pre&s;ent well plac'd found them friends in the congregation it &s;elf; and where any Nuncio with his impudent zeal pretended to take &s;uch a long voyage to oppo&s;e them, <HI>Satan</HI> took care to get him &s;ent back <HI>re infecta,</HI> or in|&s;pir'd the mi&s;&s;ion to move him off the premi&s;&s;es, by methods of their own (that is to &s;ay, being interpreted) to <HI>murther him.</HI></P>
<P>Thus the mi&s;&s;ion has in it &s;elf been truly <HI>devili&s;h,</HI> and the Devil has intere&s;ted him&s;elf in the planting the chri&s;tian religion in <HI>China.</HI></P>
<P>The influence <HI>the Devil</HI> has in the Politicks of mankind, is another e&s;pecial part of his hi&s;tory, and would require, if it were po&s;&s;ible, a very exact de&s;cription; but here we &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily be obli|ged to inquire &s;o nicely into the Arcana of circum|&s;tances, and unlock the cabinets of &s;tate in &s;o many

<P>Be it that the Devil has had a &s;hare in &s;ome of the late councils of <HI>Europe,</HI> influencing them this way or that way, to his own advantage, what is it to us? For example, What if he has had any concern in the late affair of <HI>Thorn?</HI> What need we put it upon him, &s;eeing his confederates the <HI>Je&s;u|ites</HI> with the <HI>A&s;&s;e&s;&s;orial</HI> tribunal of <HI>Poland</HI> take it upon them&s;elves? I &s;hall leave that part to the i&s;&s;ue of time. I wi&s;h it were as ea&s;y to per&s;uade the world that he had no hand in bringing the injur'd Prote&s;tants to commit the arbitration of that af|fair to the very party, and leave the ju&s;tice due to the cries of prote&s;tant blood to the arbitrement of a popi&s;h power, who dare &s;ay that <HI>the Devil</HI> mu&s;t be in it, if ju&s;tice &s;hould be obtain'd that way: I &s;hould rather &s;ay, <HI>the Devil</HI> is in it, or el&s;e it would never be expected.</P>
<P>It occurs next to enquire from the premi&s;&s;es, whether <HI>the Devil</HI> has more influence or le&s;s in the affairs of the world NOW, than he had in former ages; and this will depend upon comparing as we go along, his methods and way of working in pa&s;t times, and the modern politicks by which he acts in our days; with the differing reception which has he met with among the men of &s;uch di&s;|tant ages.</P>

But there is &s;o much to enquire of about <HI>the Devil,</HI> before we can bring his &s;tory down to our modern times, that we mu&s;t for the pre|&s;ent let that drop, and look a little back to the remoter part of his hi&s;tory, and draw his picture that people may know him when they meet him, and &s;ee who and what he is, and what he has been doing ever &s;ince he got leave to act in the high &s;tation he now appears in.</P>
<P>In the mean time, if I might obtain leave to pre&s;ent an humble petition to <HI>Satan,</HI> it &s;hould be, that he would according to modern u&s;age oblige us all with writing <HI>the hi&s;tory of his own times;</HI> 'twould, as well as one that is gone before it, be a devili&s;h good one; for as to the &s;incerity of the performance, the authority of the particulars, the ju&s;tice of the characters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if they were no bet|ter vouch'd, no more con&s;i&s;tent with them&s;elves, with charity, with truth, and with the honour of an hi&s;torian, than the la&s;t of that kind which came abroad among us, it mu&s;t be a reproach to <HI>the Devil</HI> him&s;elf to be author of it.</P>
<P>Were <HI>Satan</HI> to be brought under the lea&s;t obligation to write truth, and that the matters of fact, which he &s;hould write, might be depended upon, he is certainly qualified by his knowledge of things to be a compleat hi&s;torian; nor could the Bi&s;hop him&s;elf, <HI>who, by the way, has given us already the devil of a hi&s;tory,</HI> come up to him: <HI>Milton</HI>'s <HI>pandemonium,</HI> tho' an excellent drama|tick performance, would appear a meer trifling &s;ing-&s;ong bu&s;ine&s;s, beneath the dignity of <HI>Chevy|cha&s;e:</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> could give us a true account of all the civil wars in Heaven; how and by whom, and in what manner he lo&s;t the day there, and was oblig'd to quit the field: The fiction of his refu&s;ing to acknowledge and &s;ubmit to the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> upon his being declar'd Generali&s;&s;imo of

<P>Then, who like him, could give a full and com|pleat account of the deluge, whether it was a meer vindictive, a bla&s;t from heaven, wrought by a &s;upernatural power in the way of miracle? or whether, according to Mr. <HI>Burnet</HI>'s <HI>Theory,</HI> it was a con&s;equence following antecedent cau&s;es by the meer nece&s;&s;ities of nature, &s;een in con&s;tituti|on, natural po&s;ition, and unavoidable working of things, as by the Theory publi&s;h'd by that learn'd enthu&s;ia&s;t it &s;eems to be?</P>
<P><HI>Satan</HI> could ea&s;ily account for all the difficul|ties of the <HI>Theory,</HI> and tell us whether, as there was a natural nece&s;&s;ity of the deluge, there is not the like nece&s;&s;ity and natural tendency to a conflagra|tion at la&s;t.</P>
<P>Would <HI>the Devil</HI> exert him&s;elf as an hi&s;torian, for our improvement and diver&s;ion, how glorious an account could he give us of <HI>Noah</HI>'s voyage

round the world, in the famous Ark! he could re|&s;olve all the difficulties about the building it, the fur|ni&s;hing it, and the laying up provi&s;ions in it for all the collection of kinds that he had made; He could tell us whether all the creatures came voluntier to him to go into the ark, or whether he went a hunting for &s;everal years before, in order to bring them together.</P>
<P>He could give us a true relation how he wheed|led the people of the next world into the ab&s;urd ridiculous undertaking of building a <HI>Babel;</HI> how far that &s;tupendous &s;tair-ca&s;e, which was in imagina|tion to reach up to Heaven, was carried, before it was interrupted and the builders confounded; how their &s;peech was alter'd, how many tongues it was divided into, or whether they were divided at all; and how many &s;ubdivi&s;ions or dialects have been made &s;ince that, by which means very few of God's creatures, except the Brutes, under&s;tand one another, or care one farthing whether they do or no.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e things <HI>Satan,</HI> who, no doubt, would make a very good chronologi&s;t, could &s;ettle every Epocha, correct ever Calendar, and bring all our accounts of time to a general agreement, as well the <HI>Grecian Olympiads,</HI> the <HI>Turki&s;h Heghira,</HI> the <HI>Chine&s;e</HI> fictitious accounts of the world's duration, as our blind Julian and Gregorian accounts, which put the world, to this day, in &s;uch confu&s;ion, that we neither agree in our holy days or working days, fa&s;ts or fea&s;ts, nor keep the &s;ame &s;abbath in any part of the &s;ame globe.</P>
<P>This great Antiquary could bring us to a certain|ty in all the difficulties of ancient &s;tory, and tell us whether the tale of the &s;iege of <HI>Troy,</HI> and the rape of <HI>Helen</HI> was a fable of <HI>Homer</HI> or a hi&s;tory; whether the fictions of the Poets are form'd from their own brain, or founded in facts, and whe|ther

letters were invented by <HI>Cadmus</HI> the <HI>Phoeni|cian,</HI> or dictated immediately from <HI>Heaven</HI> at mount <HI>Sinai.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, he could tell us how and in what manner he wheedled <HI>Eve,</HI> deluded <HI>Adam,</HI> put <HI>Cain</HI> into a pa&s;&s;ion, till he made him murther his own bro|ther; and made <HI>Noah,</HI> who was above 500 years a preacher of righteou&s;ne&s;s, turn &s;ot in his old age, di&s;honour all his mini&s;try, debauch him&s;elf with wine, and by getting drunk and expo&s;ing him&s;elf, become the je&s;t and laughing &s;tock of his children, and of all his po&s;terity to this day.</P>
<P>And would Satan, according to the modern practice of the late right reverend Hi&s;torian, enter into the characters of the great men of his age, how &s;hould we be diverted with the ju&s;t hi&s;tory of <HI>Adam,</HI> in paradi&s;e and out of it, his character, and how he behaved at and after his expul&s;ion; how <HI>Cain</HI> wandered in the land of <HI>Nod,</HI> what the mark was which <HI>God</HI> &s;et upon him, who&s;e daugh|ter his wife was, and how big the city was he built there, according to a certain poet of noble extraction,</P>

<P>He could certainly have drawn <HI>Eve</HI>'s picture, told us every feature in her face, and every inch in her &s;hape, whether &s;he was a perfect beauty or no, and whether with the fall &s;he did grow crook|ed, ugly, ill natur'd and a &s;cold; as the learned <HI>Valdemar</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts to be the effect of the cur&s;e.</P>

the characters of <HI>Belus,</HI> wor&s;hip'd under the name of <HI>Baal, Saturn</HI> and <HI>Jupiter,</HI> his &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors, who they were here, and how they behaved; with all the <HI>Pharaohs</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the <HI>Abimilechs</HI> of <HI>Canaan,</HI> and the monarchs of <HI>A&s;&s;yria</HI> and <HI>Ba|bylon.</HI></P>

<P>I could enlarge with a particular &s;atisfaction up|on the many fine things which <HI>Satan,</HI> rummaging that unexhau&s;tible &s;torehou&s;e of &s;lander, could &s;et down to blacken the characters of good men, and load the be&s;t princes of the world with infamy and reproach.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall never prevail with him, I doubt, to do mankind &s;o much &s;ervice as re&s;olving all tho&s;e difficulties would be; for he has an indelible grudge again&s;t us, as he believes, and perhaps is a&s;&s;ur'd that men were at fir&s;t created by his &s;overeign, to the intent that after a certain &s;tate of probation in life, &s;uch of them as &s;hall be approved, are appoin|ted to fill up tho&s;e vacancies in the Heavenly Ho&s;t, which were made by the abdication and expul&s;ion of him <HI>the Devil</HI> and his Angels; &s;o that man is appointed to come in <HI>Satan</HI>'s &s;tead, to make good the breach and enjoy all tho&s;e ineffable joys and beatitudes which <HI>Satan</HI> enjoy'd before his fall; no wonder then, that <HI>the Devil</HI> &s;wells with envy and rage at mankind in general, and at the be&s;t of them in particular; nay, the granting this point is giv|ing an unan&s;werable rea&s;on, why the <HI>Devil</HI> practi&s;es with &s;uch unwearied and indefatigable application upon the be&s;t men, if po&s;&s;ible, to di&s;appoint GOD

It is true indeed, <HI>the Devil,</HI> who we have rea&s;on to &s;ay is no fool, ought to know better than to &s;uppo&s;e that if he could &s;educe the whole race of mankind and make them as bad as him|&s;elf, he could, by the &s;ucce&s;s of his wickedne&s;s, thwart or di&s;appoint the determined purpo&s;es of heaven; but that tho&s;e which are appointed to inherit the thrones, which he and his fol|lowers abdicated and were depo&s;ed from, &s;hall certainly be pre&s;erv'd in &s;pite of all his Devices for that inheritance, and &s;hall have the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;e|cur'd to them, notwith&s;tanding all that <HI>the Devil</HI> and all the Ho&s;t of <HI>Hell</HI> can do to pre|vent it.</P>
<P>But, however he knows the certainty of this, and that when he endeavours the &s;educing the cho|&s;en &s;ervants of the mo&s;t High, he fights again&s;t GOD him&s;elf, &s;truggles with irre&s;i&s;tible grace, and makes war with infinite power, undermining the church of God and that faith in him which are fortified with the eternal promi&s;es of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, that the gates of <HI>Hell,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Devil</HI> and all his power &s;hall not prevail again&s;t them; I &s;ay, however he knows how impo&s;&s;ible it is that he &s;hould obtain his ends, yet &s;o blind is his rage, &s;o infatuate is his wi&s;dom, that he cannot refrain breaking him&s;elf to pieces again&s;t this mountain, and &s;plitting again&s;t this rock. <HI>qui Jupiter vult perdere hos dementat.</HI></P>

<P>This &s;hort Diologue happen'd between two men of quality, and both men of wit too; and the effect was, that the Lord brought the reality of <HI>the Devil</HI> into the que&s;tion, and the debate brought the profligate to be a penitent; &s;o in &s;hort, <HI>the Devil</HI> was made a preacher of repentance.</P>
<P>The Truth is, <HI>God</HI> and <HI>the Devil,</HI> however op|po&s;ite in their nature, and remote from one ano|ther in their place of abiding, &s;eem to &s;tand pret|ty much upon a level in our faith: For as to our believing the reality of their exi&s;tence, he that
<PB N="23" REF="31">
denies one generally denies both; and he that be|lieves one nece&s;&s;arily believes both.</P>
<P>Very few, if any of tho&s;e who believe there is a GOD, and acknowledge the debt of homage which mankind owes to the &s;upreme Governor of the World, doubt the exi&s;tence of <HI>the Devil,</HI> ex|cept here and there one, whom we call practical Athei&s;ts; and 'tis the character of an Athei&s;t, if there is &s;uch a creature on Earth, that like my <HI>Lord Duke,</HI> he believes neither GOD or <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>As the belief of both the&s;e &s;tands upon a level, and that GOD and the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;eem to have an equal &s;hare in our faith; &s;o the evidence of their exi&s;tence &s;eems to &s;tand upon a level too, in many things; and as they are known by their Works in the &s;ame particular ca&s;es, &s;o they are di&s;cover'd after the &s;ame manner of demon&s;tration.</P>
<P>Nay, in &s;ome re&s;pects 'tis equally criminal to deny the reality of them both, only with this difference, that to believe the exi&s;tence of a GOD is a debt to nature, and to believe the exi&s;tence of <HI>the Devil</HI> is a like debt to rea&s;on; one is a demon|&s;tration from the reality of vi&s;ible cau&s;es, and the other a deduction from the like reality of their effects.</P>
<P>One demon&s;tration of the exi&s;tence of GOD, is from the univer&s;al well-guided con&s;ent of all nations to wor&s;hip and adore a &s;upreme Power; One demon&s;tration of the exi&s;tence of the <HI>Devil,</HI> is from the avow'd ill-guided con&s;ent of &s;ome na|tions, who knowing no other GOD, make a GOD of the <HI>Devil</HI> for want of a better.</P>
<P>It may be true, that tho&s;e nations have no other ideas of the Devil than as of a &s;uperior Power; if they thought him a &s;upreme Power it would have other effects on them, and they will &s;ubmit to and wor&s;hip him with a different kind of fear.</P>
<P><PB N="24" REF="32">
But 'tis plain they have right notions of him as a Devil or evil Spirit, becau&s;e the be&s;t rea&s;on, and in &s;ome places the only rea&s;on they give for wor&s;hip|ing him is, that he may do them no hurt; having no notions at all of his having any power, much le&s;s any inclination to do them any good; &s;o that in|deed they make a meer <HI>Devil</HI> of him, at the &s;ame time that they bow to him as to a GOD.</P>
<P>All the ages of Pagani&s;m in the World have had this notion of <HI>the Devil:</HI> indeed in &s;ome parts of the World they had al&s;o &s;ome Deities which they honour'd above him, as being &s;uppo&s;ed to be beneficent, kind and inclin'd, as well as capable to give them good things; for this rea&s;on the more polite Heathens, &s;uch as the <HI>Graecians</HI> and the <HI>Romans,</HI> had their <HI>Lares</HI> or hou&s;hold Gods, who they paid a particular re&s;pect to, as being their Protectors from Hobgoblins, Gho&s;ts of the Dead, evil Spirits, frightful appearances, evil Ge|nius's and other noxious creatures from the invi|&s;ible World; or to put it into the language of the day we live in, from <HI>the Devil,</HI> in whatever &s;hape or appearance he might come to them, and from whatever might hurt them: and what was all this but &s;etting up <HI>Devils</HI> again&s;t <HI>Devils,</HI> &s;upplica|ting one <HI>Devil</HI> under the notion of a good Spirit, to drive out and protect them from another, whom they call'd a bad Spirit, the white <HI>Devil</HI> again&s;t the black <HI>Devil?</HI></P>
<P>This proceeds from the natural notions man|kind nece&s;&s;arily entertain of things to come; <HI>&s;upe|rior</HI> or <HI>inferior,</HI> GOD and the <HI>Devil,</HI> fill up all fu|turity in our thoughts; and 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for us to form any images in our minds of an immor|tality and an invi&s;ible World, but under the no|tions of perfect felicity, or extreme mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>Now as the&s;e two re&s;pect the Eternal &s;tate of man after life, they are re&s;pectively the object
<PB N="25" REF="33">
of our reverence and affection, or of our horror and aver&s;ion; but notwith&s;tanding they are plac'd thus in a diametrical oppo&s;ition in our affections and pa&s;&s;ions, they are on an evident level as to the cer|tainty of their exi&s;tence, and, as I &s;aid above, bear an equal &s;hare in our faith.</P>
<P>It being then as certain that there is <HI>a Devil,</HI> as that there is <HI>a God,</HI> I mu&s;t from this time forward admit no more doubt of his exi&s;tence, nor take any more pains to convince you of it; but &s;peak|ing of him as a reality in Being, proceed to enquire who he is, and from whence, in order to enter directly into the detail of his Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Now not to enter into all the metaphy&s;ical trum|pery of the Schools, nor wholly to confine my &s;elf to the language of the Pulpit; where we are told, that to think of GOD and of the <HI>Devil,</HI> we mu&s;t endeavour fir&s;t to form ideas of tho&s;e things which illu&s;trate the de&s;cription of rewards and puni&s;hments; in the one the eternal pre&s;ence of the highe&s;t good, and, as a nece&s;&s;ary attendant, the mo&s;t perfect, con&s;ummate, durable bli&s;s and felicity, &s;pringing from the pre&s;ence of that Being in whom all po&s;&s;ible Beatitude is inexpre&s;&s;ibly pre&s;ent, and that in the highe&s;t perfection; And on the contra|ry, to conceive of a &s;ublime fallen Arch-angel, attended with an innumerable ho&s;t of degenerate, rebel Seraphs or Angels ca&s;t out of Heaven toge|ther; all guilty of inexpre&s;&s;ible rebellion, and all &s;uffering from that time, and to &s;uffer for ever the eternal vengeance of the Almighty, in an in|conceivable manner; that his pre&s;ence, tho' ble&s;&s;ed in it &s;elf, is to them the mo&s;t compleat article of ter|ror; That they are in them&s;elves perfectly mi&s;erable; and to be with whom for ever, adds an inex|pre&s;&s;ible mi&s;ery to any &s;tate as well as place; and fills the minds of tho&s;e who are to be, or expect to
<PB N="26" REF="34">
be bani&s;h'd to them with inconceivable horror and amazement.</P>
<P>But when you have gone over all this, and a great deal more of the like, tho' le&s;s intelligible language, which the pa&s;&s;ions of men collect to amu&s;e one another with; you have &s;aid nothing if you omit the main article, namely, the per&s;onality of <HI>the Devil;</HI> and till you add to all the re&s;t &s;ome de&s;cription of the company with whom all this is to be &s;uffer'd, <HI>viz.</HI> the <HI>Devil and his Angels.</HI></P>
<P>Now who this <HI>Devil and his Angels</HI> are, what &s;hare they have either actively or pa&s;&s;ively in the eternal mi&s;eries of a future &s;tate, how far they are Agents in or Partners with the &s;ufferings of the Place, is a difficulty yet not fully di&s;cover'd by the mo&s;t learned; nor do I believe 'tis made le&s;s a difficulty by their medling with it.</P>
<P>But to come to the per&s;on and original of <HI>the Devil,</HI> or, as I &s;aid before, of <HI>Devils;</HI> I allow him to come of an antient family, for he is from Hea|ven, and more truly than the <HI>Romans</HI> could &s;ay of their idoliz'd <HI>Numa,</HI> he is of the race of the Gods.</P>
<P>That <HI>Satan</HI> is a fallen Angel, a rebel Seraph, ca&s;t out for his Rebellion, 'tis the general opini|on, and 'tis not my bu&s;ine&s;s to di&s;pute things uni|ver&s;ally receiv'd; as he was try'd, condemn'd and the &s;entence of expul&s;ion executed on him in Heaven, he is in this World like a tran&s;ported Fe|lon never to return; His crime, whatever par|ticular aggravations it might have, 'tis certain, amounted to High-trea&s;on again&s;t his Lord and Go|vernor, who was al&s;o his Maker, and again&s;t whom he ro&s;e in rebellion, took up arms, and in a word, rais'd a horrid and unnatural war in his domini|ons; but being overcome in battle and made pri|&s;oner, he and all his Ho&s;t, who&s;e numbers were

infinite, all glorious Angels like him&s;elf, lo&s;t at once their beauty and glory with their Innocence, and commenc'd <HI>Devils,</HI> being transform'd by crime into mon&s;ters and frightful objects; &s;uch as to de&s;cribe, human fancy is obliged to draw pictures and de&s;criptions in &s;uch forms as are mo&s;t hateful and frightful to the imagination.</P>
<P>The&s;e notions, I doubt not, gave birth to all the beauteous images and &s;ublime expre&s;&s;ions in <HI>Milton</HI>'s maje&s;tick Poem; where, tho' he has play'd the Poet in a mo&s;t luxuriant manner, he has &s;inn'd a|gain&s;t <HI>Satan</HI> mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly, and done the <HI>Devil</HI> a manife&s;t injury in a great many particulars, as I &s;hall &s;hew in its place. And as I &s;hall be oblig'd to do <HI>Satan</HI> ju&s;tice when I come to that part of his Hi&s;tory, Mr. <HI>Milton</HI>'s admirers mu&s;t pardon me, if I let them &s;ee, that tho' I admire Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> as a Poet, yet that he was greatly out in matters of Hi&s;tory, and e&s;pecially the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Devil;</HI> in &s;hort, That he has charged <HI>Satan</HI> fal&s;ly in &s;e|veral particulars; and &s;o he has <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> too: But that I &s;hall leave till I come to the Hi|&s;tory of the Royal Family of <HI>Eden;</HI> which I re|&s;olve to pre&s;ent you with when the <HI>Devil</HI> and I have done with one another.</P>
<P>But not to run down Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> neither, who&s;e poetry, nor his judgment, cannot be reproached without injury to our own; all tho&s;e bright ideas of his, which make his poem &s;o ju&s;tly valued, whether they are capable of proof as to the fact, are notwith&s;tanding, confirmations of my hypo|the&s;is; and are taken from a &s;uppo&s;ition of the Per&s;onality of the <HI>Devil,</HI> placing him at the head of the infernal ho&s;t, as a &s;overeign ele|vated Spirit and Monarch of Hell; and as &s;uch it is that I undertake to write his Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>By the word Hell I do not &s;uppo&s;e, or at lea&s;t not determine, that his re&s;idence or that of the
<PB N="28" REF="36">
whole army of <HI>Devils</HI> is yet in the &s;ame local HELL, to which the Divines tell us he &s;hall be at la&s;t chain'd down; or at lea&s;t that he is yet con|fin'd to it, for we &s;hall find he is at pre&s;ent a pri|&s;oner at large: of both which circum&s;tances of Satan I &s;hall take occa&s;ion to &s;peak in its cour&s;e.</P>
<P>But when I call the Devil the Monarch of <HI>Hell,</HI> I am to be under&s;tood as &s;uits to the pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e; that he is the Sovereign of all the race of Hell, that is to &s;ay of all the Devils or Spirits of the infernal Clan, let their numbers, quality and powers be what they will.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;uppo&s;ed per&s;onality and &s;uperiority of <HI>Satan,</HI> or, as I call it, the &s;overeignty and go|vernment of one Devil above all the re&s;t; I &s;ay, upon this notion are form'd all the &s;y&s;tems of the dark &s;ide of futurity, that we can form in our minds: And &s;o general is the opinion of it, that it will hardly bear to be oppos'd by any other argument, at lea&s;t that will bear to be rea&s;on'd upon: All the notions of a parity of Devils, or making a common-wealth among the black Divan, &s;eem to be enthu&s;ia&s;tick and vi&s;ionary, but with no con|&s;i&s;tency or certainty, and is &s;o generally exploded, that we mu&s;t not venture &s;o much as to debate the point.</P>
<P>Taking it then as the generality of mankind do, that there is a Grand Devil, a &s;uperior of the whole black race; that they all fell, together with their General <HI>Satan,</HI> at the head of them; that tho' he, <HI>Satan,</HI> could not maintain his high &s;ta|tion in Heaven, yet that he did continue his dig|nity among the re&s;t, who are call'd his &s;ervants, <HI>in Scripture his Angels;</HI> that he has a kind of do|minion or authority over the re&s;t, and that they were all, how many millions &s;oever in number, at his command; employ'd by him in all his helli&s;h
<PB N="29" REF="37">
de&s;igns, and in all his wicked contrivances for the de&s;truction of man, and for the &s;etting up his own kingdom in the world.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;ing then that there is &s;uch a &s;uperior Ma&s;ter-Devil over all the re&s;t, it remains that we enquire into his Character, and &s;omething of his Hi&s;tory; in which, tho' we cannot perhaps pro|duce &s;uch authentick documents as in the &s;tory of other great Monarchs, Tyrants, and Furies of the World; yet I &s;hall endeavour to &s;peak &s;ome things which the experience of mankind may be apt to confirm, and which the Devil him&s;elf will hardly be able to contradict.</P>
<P>It being then granted that there is &s;uch a thing or per&s;on, call him which we will, as a Ma&s;ter-Devil; that he is thus &s;uperior to all the re&s;t in power and in authority, and that all the other evil Spirits are his Angels, or Mini&s;ters, or Officers to execute his commands, and are employ'd in his bu&s;ine&s;s; it remains to enquire, whence he came? how he came hither into this World? what that bu&s;ine&s;s is which he is employ'd about? what his pre&s;ent &s;tate is, and where and to what part of the creation of God he is limited and re&s;trained? what the liberties are he takes or is allow'd to take? in what manner he works, and how his in|&s;truments are likewi&s;e allow'd to work? what he has done ever &s;ince he commenc'd Devil, and what he is now doing, and what he may yet do before his la&s;t and clo&s;er confinement? as al&s;o what he cannot do, and how far we may or may not be &s;aid to be expo&s;ed to him, or have or have not rea&s;on to be afraid of him? The&s;e, and whatever el&s;e occurrs in the Hi&s;tory and conduct of this Arch-devil and his Agents, that may be u&s;eful for information, caution or diver&s;ion, you may ex|pect in the proce&s;s of this work.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="38">
I know it has been que&s;tion'd by &s;ome, with more face than fear, how it con&s;i&s;ts with a compleat victory of the Devil, which they &s;ay was at fir&s;t obtain'd by the heavenly Powers over <HI>Satan</HI> and his apo&s;tate army in <HI>Heaven,</HI> that when he was ca&s;t out of the holy place, and da&s;h'd down into the aby&s;s of eternal darkne&s;s, as into a place of puni&s;hment, a condemn'd hold, or place of con|finement, to be re&s;erved there to the judgment of the great Day; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> how it con&s;i&s;ts with that entire victory, to let him loo&s;e again and give him liberty, like a thief that has broke pri&s;on, to range about God's creation, and there to continue his rebellion, commit new ravages, and acts of ho&s;tility again&s;t God, make new efforts at de|throning the almighty Creator; and in particular to fall upon the weake&s;t of his creatures MAN? how <HI>Satan</HI> being &s;o entirely vanqui&s;h'd, he &s;hould be permitted to recover any of his wicked powers, and find room to do mi&s;chief to mankind.</P>
<P>Nay they go farther, and &s;ugge&s;t bold things again&s;t the wi&s;dom of Heaven, in expo&s;ing man|kind, weak in compari&s;on of the immen&s;e extent of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s power, to &s;o manife&s;t an overthrow, to &s;o unequal a fight, in which he is &s;ure, if alone in the conflict, to be wor&s;ted, to leave him &s;uch a dreadful enemy to engage with, and &s;o ill fur|ni&s;h'd with weapons to re&s;i&s;t him.</P>
<P>The&s;e objections I &s;hall give as good an an|&s;wer to as the ca&s;e will admit in their cour&s;e, but mu&s;t adjourn them for the pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>That the Devil is not yet a clo&s;e pri&s;oner, we have evidence enough to confirm; I will not &s;ugge&s;t, that like our <HI>Nwgate</HI> thieves, (to bring little Devils and great Devils together) he is let out by connivance, and has &s;ome little latitudes and advantages for mi&s;chief, by that means; return|ing at certain &s;ea&s;ons to his confinement again.

This might hold, were it not, that the compari&s;on mu&s;t &s;ugge&s;t, that the power which has ca&s;t him down could be deluded, and the under-keepers or jaylors, under who&s;e charge he was in cu&s;tody, could wink at his excur&s;ions, and the Lord of the place know nothing of the matter.

<P>TO come to a regular enquiry into Satan's affairs, 'tis needful we &s;hould go back to his original, as far as hi&s;tory and the opinion of the learned World give us leave.</P>
<P>It is agreed by all Writers, as well &s;acred as pro|phane, that this creature we now call a Devil, was originally an Angel of light, a glorious Seraph; perhaps the choice&s;t of all the glorious Seraphs. See how <HI>Milton</HI> de&s;cribes his original glory:</P>
<Q><L><HI>Satan,</HI> &s;o call him now, his former name</L>
<L>Is heard no more in Heaven: He of the fir&s;t,</L>

<L>Of Angels, than that &s;tar the &s;tars among.</L>
<P><HI>lib.</HI> vii. <HI>fol.</HI> 189.</P></Q>
<P>The glorious figure which Satan is &s;uppo&s;ed to make among the <HI>Thrones</HI> and <HI>Dominions</HI> in Hea|ven is &s;uch, as we might &s;uppo&s;e the highe&s;t An|gel in that exalted train could make; and &s;ome think, <HI>as above,</HI> that he was the chief of the Arch-angels.</P>
<P>Hence that notion, and not ill founded, <HI>namely,</HI> that the fir&s;t cau&s;e of his di&s;grace, and on which en&s;ued his rebellion, was occa&s;ioned upon God's proclaiming his SON Generali&s;&s;imo, and with him&s;elf &s;upreme ruler in Heaven, giving the do|minion of all his works of creation, as well al|ready fini&s;h'd as not then begun, to him; which po&s;t of honour (&s;ay they) <HI>Satan</HI> expected to be conferr'd on him&s;elf, as next in honour, maje&s;ty and power to God the Supreme.</P>
<P>This opinion is follow'd by Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> too, as appears in the following lines, where he makes all the Angels attending at a general &s;ummons, and God the Father making the following de|claration to them:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Hear all ye Angels, prodigy of light, Thrones, dominions, princedoms, virtues, pow'rs! Hear my decree, which unrevok'd &s;hall &s;tand.

<HEAD>CHAP. IV. <HI>Of the name of the Devil, his original, and the nature of his circum&s;tances &s;ince he has been called by that name.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Scripture is the fir&s;t writing on earth where we find the <HI>Devil</HI> called by his own proper di&s;tingui&s;hing denomination, DEVIL,
<PB N="39" REF="47">
or the <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The meaning of the word Devil is De&s;troyer. See <HI>Pool</HI> upon <HI>Acts</HI> xiii. 10.</NOTE> <HI>De&s;troyer;</HI> nor indeed is there any other author of antiquity or of &s;ufficient authority which &s;ays any thing of that kind about him.</P>
<P>Here he makes his fir&s;t appearance in the world, and on that occa&s;ion he is called the <HI>Serpent;</HI> but the <HI>Serpent</HI> however &s;ince made to &s;ignify the <HI>Devil,</HI> when &s;poken of in general terms, was but the Devil's repre&s;entative, or the Devil <HI>in quovis vehiculo,</HI> for that time, clothed in a bodily &s;hape, acting under cover and in di&s;gui&s;e, or if you will the <HI>Devil</HI> in <HI>ma&s;querade:</HI> Nay, if we believe Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> the <HI>Angel Gabriel</HI>'s &s;pear had &s;uch a &s;ecret powerful influence, as to make him &s;trip of a &s;udden, and with a touch to unmask, and &s;tand upright in his naked original &s;hape, meer <HI>Devil,</HI> without any di&s;gui&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Now as we go to the Scripture for much of his hi&s;tory, &s;o we mu&s;t go there al&s;o for &s;ome of his names; and he has a great variety of names in|deed, as his &s;everal mi&s;chievous doings guide us to conceive of him. The truth is, all the antient names given him, of which the Scripture is full, &s;eem to be originals derived from and adapted to the &s;everal &s;teps he has taken, and the &s;everal &s;hapes he has appeared in to do mi&s;chief in the world.</P>

<P>But to &s;um them all up in one, he is called in the new Te&s;tament <HI>plain</HI> DEVIL; all his other names are varied according to the cu&s;tom of &s;peech, and the dialects of the &s;everal nations where he is &s;poken of; But in a word, <HI>Devil</HI> is the common name of the <HI>Devil</HI> in all the known languages of the earth. Nay, all the mi&s;chiefs he is empowered to do, are in Scripture placed to his account, un|der the particular title of the <HI>Devil,</HI> not of <HI>Devils</HI> in the plural number, though they are &s;ometimes mentioned too; but in the &s;ingular it is the iden|tical individual <HI>Devil,</HI> in and under whom all the little <HI>Devils,</HI> and all the great <HI>Devils,</HI> if &s;uch there be, are &s;uppo&s;ed to act; nay, they are &s;uppo&s;ed to be govern'd and directed by him. Thus we are told in Scripture of the works of <HI>the Devil,</HI> 1 John iii. 8. of ca&s;ting out <HI>the Devil,</HI> Mark i. 34. of re&s;i&s;ting <HI>the Devil,</HI> James iv. 5. of our Saviour being tempted of <HI>the Devil,</HI> Mat. iv. 1. of <HI>Si|mon Magus,</HI> a child of the <HI>Devil,</HI> Acts xiii. 10. The <HI>Devil</HI> came down in a great wrath, <HI>Rev.</HI> xii.
<PB N="41" REF="49">
12. <HI>and the like.</HI> And according to this u&s;age in &s;peech we go on to this day, and all the internal things we conver&s;e with in the world, are fathered upon the <HI>Devil,</HI> as one undivided &s;imple e&s;&s;ence, by how many agents &s;oever working: Every thing evil, frightful in appearance, wicked in its actings, horrible in its manner, mon&s;trous in its effects, is called the <HI>Devil;</HI> in a word, <HI>Devil</HI> is the common name for all <HI>Devils,</HI> that is to &s;ay, for all evil Spirits, all evil Powers, all evil Works, and even all evil things: Yet 'tis remarkable <HI>the Devil</HI> is no old Te&s;tament word, and we never find it u&s;ed in all the old Te&s;tament but four times, and then not once in the &s;ingular number, and not once to &s;ignify <HI>Satan</HI> as 'tis now under&s;tood.</P>
<P>It is true, the Learned give a great many differ|ing interpretations of the word <HI>Devil;</HI> the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Commentators tell us, it means <HI>a de&s;troyer,</HI> others that it &s;ignifies a deceiver, and the <HI>Greeks</HI> derive it from a <HI>Calumniator</HI> or fal&s;e witne&s;s; for we find that <HI>Calumnie</HI> was a <HI>Godde&s;s,</HI> to whom the <HI>Athenians</HI> built altars and offer'd &s;acrifices upon &s;ome &s;olemn occa&s;ions, and they call her <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, from whence came the ma&s;culine <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> which we tran&s;late <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Thus we take the name of <HI>Devil</HI> to &s;ignify not per&s;ons only, but actions and habits, making ima|ginary Devils, and transforming that &s;ub&s;tantial creature call'd DEVIL into every thing noxious and offen&s;ive: Thus St. <HI>Francis</HI> being tempted by the <HI>Devil</HI> in the &s;hape of a bag of money lying in the high way, <HI>the Saint</HI> having di&s;cover'd the fraud, whether &s;eeing his <HI>Cloven-foot</HI> hang out of the pur&s;e, or whether he di&s;tingui&s;h'd him by his &s;mell of <HI>&s;ulphur,</HI> or how otherwi&s;e, authors are not agreed; but, I &s;ay, the Saint having di&s;co|ver'd the cheat, and out-witted the <HI>Devil,</HI> took occa&s;ion to preach that eminent &s;ermon to his
<PB N="42" REF="50">
di&s;ciples, where his Text was, <HI>Money is</HI> THE DEVIL.</P>
<P>Nor upon the whole, is any wrong done to <HI>the Devil</HI> by this kind of treatment, it only gives him the &s;overeignty of the whole army of Hell, and making all the numberle&s;s legions of the bot|tomle&s;s pit &s;ervants; or <HI>as the Scripture calls them,</HI> Angels to <HI>Satan</HI> the grand <HI>Devil;</HI> all their ac|tions, performances and atchievements are ju&s;tly attributed to him, not as the prince of <HI>Devils</HI> only, but the Emperor of <HI>Devils,</HI> the prince of all the princes of <HI>Devils.</HI></P>
<P>Under this denomination then of DEVIL, all the Powers of Hell, all the Princes of the air, all the black armies of <HI>Satan</HI> are comprehended, and in this manner they are to be under&s;tood in this whole work, <HI>mutatis mutandis,</HI> according to the &s;everal circum&s;tances in which we are to &s;peak of them.</P>
<P>This being premis'd, and my authority being &s;o good, <HI>Satan</HI> mu&s;t not take it ill, if I treat him <HI>after the manner of men,</HI> and give him tho&s;e titles which he is be&s;t known by among us; for indeed having &s;o many, 'tis not very ea&s;y to call him out of his name.</P>
<P>However, as I am oblig'd by the duty of an Hi&s;torian to decency as well as impartiality, &s;o I thought it nece&s;&s;ary, before I u&s;ed too much free|dom with <HI>Satan,</HI> to produce authentick Docu|ments, and bring antiquity upon the &s;tage, to ju&s;ti|fy the manner of my writing, and let you &s;ee I &s;hall de&s;cribe him in no colours, nor call him by any name, but what he has been known by for many ages before me.</P>
<P>And now, tho' being writing to the common under&s;tanding of my Reader, I am oblig'd to treat <HI>Satan</HI> very coar&s;ly, and to &s;peak of him in the common acceptation, calling him plain <HI>Devil,</HI> a word which in this mannerly age is not &s;o <HI>&s;ono|$ous</HI>

as others might be, and which by the error of the Times is apt to prejudice us again&s;t his Per|&s;on; yet it mu&s;t be acknowleg'd he has a great many other names and &s;irnames which he might be known by, of a le&s;s obnoxious import than that of <HI>Devil,</HI> or <HI>De&s;troyer,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> indeed, wanting titles of honour to give to the Leaders of Satan's Ho&s;t, is oblig'd to borrow &s;everal of his Scripture names, and be&s;tow them upon his infernal <HI>Heroes,</HI> whom he makes the Generals and Leaders of the armies of Hell; and &s;o he makes <HI>Beelzebub, Lucifer Belial, Mam|mon</HI> and &s;ome others, to be the names of parti|cular Devils, members of <HI>Satan</HI>'s <HI>upper hou&s;e</HI> or <HI>Pandemonium;</HI> whereas indeed, the&s;e are all names proper and peculiar to <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The Scripture al&s;o has &s;ome names of a coar|&s;er kind, by which <HI>the Devil</HI> is under&s;tood, as particularly, as is noted already, in the Apoca|lyp&s;e he is call'd the <HI>Great Red Dragon,</HI> the <HI>Bea&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Old Serpent,</HI> and the like: But take it in the Scripture, or where you will in Hi&s;tory &s;acred or prophane, you will find that in general the <HI>De|vil</HI> is, as I have &s;aid above, his ordinary name in all languages and in all nations, the name by which he and his works are principally di&s;tingui&s;h'd: Al&s;o the Scripture, be&s;ides that it often gives him this name, &s;peaks of the works of <HI>the Devil,</HI> of the &s;ubtilty of <HI>the Devil,</HI> of ca&s;ting out <HI>De|vils,</HI> of being tempted of the <HI>Devil,</HI> of being po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd with a <HI>Devil,</HI> and &s;o many other expre&s;&s;ions of that kind, as I have &s;aid already, are made u&s;e of for us to under&s;tand the evil Spirit by, that in a word, <HI>Devil</HI> is the common name of all wicked Spirits: For <HI>Satan</HI> is no more <HI>the Devil,</HI> as if he alone was &s;o, and all the re&s;t were a diminutive &s;pecies who did not go by that name; But, I &s;ay, even in Scripture, every Spirit whether under his

<P>His Name then being thus a&s;certain'd, and his Exi&s;tence acknowledg'd, it &s;hould be a little en|quir'd <HI>what he is;</HI> we believe there is &s;uch a thing, &s;uch a creature as <HI>the Devil,</HI> and that he has been, and may &s;till with propriety of &s;peech, and without inju&s;tice to his Character be call'd by his antient name <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>But who is he? what is his original? whence came he? and what is his pre&s;ent &s;tation and con|dition? for the&s;e things and the&s;e enquiries are very nece&s;&s;ary to his Hi&s;tory, nor indeed can any part of his Hi&s;tory be compleat without them.</P>
<P>That he is of an antient and noble original mu&s;t be acknowledged, for he is <HI>Heaven-born,</HI> and of <HI>Angelic Race,</HI> as has been touch'd already: If Scripture-evidence may be of any weight in the que&s;tion, there is no room to doubt the genealogy of the <HI>Devil;</HI> he is not only &s;poken of as an <HI>An|gel,</HI> but as a <HI>fallen Angel,</HI> one that had been in <HI>Heaven,</HI> had beheld the face of GOD in his full effulgence of glory, and had &s;urrounded the Throne of the mo&s;t High; from whence, com|mencing rebel and being expell'd, he was ca&s;t down, down, down, GOD and the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf only knows where; for indeed we cannot &s;ay that any man on Earth knows it; and wherever it is, he has ever &s;ince man's creation been a plague to him, been a tempter, a deluder, a calumniator, an enemy and the object of man's horror and a|ver&s;ion.</P>
<P>As his original is <HI>Heaven-born,</HI> and his Race <HI>Angelic,</HI> &s;o the Angelic nature is evidently plac'd in a cla&s;s &s;uperior to the human, and this the Scrip|ture is expre&s;s in al&s;o; when &s;peaking of man,
<PB N="45" REF="53">
it &s;ays, he made him a little lower than the An|gels.</P>
<P>Thus <HI>the Devil,</HI> as mean thoughts as you may have of him, is of a better family than any of you, nay than the be&s;t Gentleman of you all; what he may be fallen to, is <HI>one thing,</HI> but what he is fallen from, <HI>is another,</HI> and therefore I mu&s;t tell my learned and reverend friend <HI>J. W.</HI> L L D. when he &s;poke &s;o rudely of <HI>the Devil</HI> lately, in my opinion he abus'd his betters.</P>
<P>Nor is the Scripture more a help to us in the &s;earch after <HI>the Devil</HI>'s Original, than it is in our &s;earch after his Nature; it is true, Authors are not agreed about his age, what time he was crea|ted, how many years he enjoy'd his &s;tate of ble&s;|&s;edne&s;s before he fell; or how many years he con|tinued with his whole army in a &s;tate of darkne&s;s be|fore the creation of man. 'Tis &s;uppo&s;ed it might be a con&s;iderable &s;pace, and that it was a part of his puni&s;hment too, being all the while unactive, un|employ'd, having no bu&s;ine&s;s, nothing to do but gnawing his own Bowels, and rolling in the ago|ny of his own &s;elf-reproaches, being a Hell to him&s;elf in reflecting on the glorious &s;tate from whence he was fallen.</P>
<P>How long he remain'd thus, 'tis true, we have no light into from Hi&s;tory, and but little from Tradi|tion; <HI>Rabbi Judah</HI> &s;ays, the <HI>Jews</HI> were of the opinion, that he remain'd twenty thou&s;and years in that condition, and that the World &s;hall con|tinue twenty thou&s;and more, in which he &s;hall find work enough to &s;atisfy his mi&s;chievous de|&s;ires; but he &s;hews no authority for his opi|nion.</P>
<P>Indeed, let the <HI>Devil</HI> have been as idle as they think he was before, it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd that now he is the mo&s;t bu&s;y, vigilant and diligent, of all
<PB N="46" REF="54">
GOD's creatures, and very full of employment too, <HI>&s;uch as it is.</HI></P>
<P>Scripture indeed, gives us light into the en|mity there is between the two natures, the dia|bolical and the human; the rea&s;on of it, and how and by what means the power of <HI>the Devil</HI> is re|&s;train'd by the <HI>Me&s;&s;ias;</HI> and to tho&s;e who are wil|ling to tru&s;t to Go&s;pel-light, and believe what the Scripture &s;ays of <HI>the Devil,</HI> there may much of his Hi&s;tory be di&s;cover'd, and therefore tho&s;e that li&s;t may go there for a fuller account of the matter.</P>
<P>But to re&s;erve all Scripture-evidence of the&s;e things, as a Magazine in &s;tore for the u&s;e of tho&s;e with whom Scripture-te&s;timony is of force, I mu&s;t for the pre&s;ent turn to other enquiries, being now directing my &s;tory to an age, wherein to be driven to Revelation and Scripture-a&s;&s;ertions is e&s;teem'd giving up the di&s;pute; people now-adays mu&s;t have demon&s;tration; and in a word, nothing will &s;atisfy the age, but &s;uch evidence as perhaps the na|ture of the que&s;tion will not admit.</P>
<P>It is hard, indeed, to bring demon&s;trations in &s;uch a ca&s;e as this: <HI>No man has &s;een</HI> GOD <HI>at any time,</HI> &s;ays the Scripture, 1 <HI>John</HI> iv. 12. So <HI>the Devil</HI> being a &s;pirit incorporeal, an Angel of light, and con&s;equently not vi&s;ible in his own &s;ub&s;tance, nature and form, it may in &s;ome &s;en&s;e be &s;aid, <HI>no man has &s;een the Devil at any time;</HI> all tho&s;e pretences of phrenziful and fanciful people, who tell us, they have &s;een <HI>the Devil,</HI> I &s;hall ex|amine, and perhaps expo&s;e by them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It might take up a great deal of our time here, to enquire whether <HI>the Devil</HI> has any particular &s;hape or per&s;onality of &s;ub&s;tance, which can be vi&s;ible to us, felt, heard or under&s;tood; and which he cannot alter, and then, what &s;hapes or appear|ances
<PB N="47" REF="55">
<HI>the Devil</HI> has at any time taken upon him? and whether he can really appear in a body which might be handled and &s;een, and yet &s;o as to know it to have been <HI>the Devil</HI> at the time of his ap|pearing; but this al&s;o I defer as not of weight in the pre&s;ent enquiry.</P>
<P>We have divers accounts of Witches conver|&s;ing with <HI>the Devil;</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> in a real body, with all the appearance of a body of a man or wo|man appearing to them; al&s;o of having a <HI>Familiar,</HI> as they call it, an <HI>Incubus</HI> or <HI>little Devil,</HI> which &s;ucks their bodies, runs away with them into the air, <HI>and the like:</HI> Much of this is &s;aid, but much more than it is ea&s;y to prove, and we ought to give but a ju&s;t proportion of credit to tho&s;e things.</P>
<P>As to his borrow'd &s;hapes and his &s;ubtile trans|formings, that we have &s;uch open te&s;timony of, that there is no room for any que&s;tion about it; and when I come to that part, I &s;hall be oblig'd ra|ther to give a hi&s;tory of the fact, than enter into any di&s;&s;ertation upon the nature and rea&s;on of it.</P>
<P>I do not find in any author, whom we can call cre|ditable, that even in tho&s;e countries where the do|minion of <HI>Satan</HI> is more particularly e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and where they may be &s;aid to wor&s;hip him in a more particular manner, as <HI>a Devil;</HI> which &s;ome tell us the <HI>Indians</HI> in <HI>America</HI> did, who wor&s;hip'd the <HI>Devil</HI> that he might not hurt them; yet, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> I do not find that even there the <HI>Devil</HI> appear'd to them in any particular con&s;tant &s;hape or per&s;ona|lity peculiar to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Scripture and Hi&s;tory therefore, giving us no light into that part of the que&s;tion, I conclude and lay it down, not as my opinion only, but as what all ages &s;eem to concur in, that the <HI>Devil</HI> has no particular body; that he is a &s;pirit, and that tho' he may, <HI>Proteus</HI> like, a&s;&s;ume the appearance of
<PB N="48" REF="56">
either man or bea&s;t, yet it mu&s;t be &s;ome borrow'd &s;hape, &s;ome a&s;&s;um'd figure, <HI>pro hac vice,</HI> and that he has no vi&s;ible body of his own.</P>
<P>I thought it needful to di&s;cu&s;s this as a prelimi|nary, and that the next di&s;cour&s;e might go upon a certainty in this grand point, namely, that the Devil, however, he may for his particular occa&s;ions put him&s;elf into a great many &s;hapes, and clothe him|&s;elf, perhaps, with what appearances he plea&s;es, yet that he is him&s;elf &s;till a meer Spirit, that he re|tains the &s;eraphic Nature, is not vi&s;ible by our eyes, which are human and Organic, neither can he act with the ordinary Powers, or in the ordinary manner as bodies do; and therefore, when he has thought fit to de&s;cend to the meanne&s;&s;es of di|&s;turbing and frightning children and old women, by noi&s;es and knockings, di&s;locating the chairs and &s;tools, breaking windows, and &s;uch like little ambulatory things, which would &s;eem to be below the dignity of his character, and which in parti|cular, is ordinarily performed by organic Powers, yet even then he has thought fit not to be &s;een, and rather to make the poor people believe he had a real &s;hape and body, with hands to act, mouth to &s;peak, <HI>and the like,</HI> than to give proof of it in common to the whole World, by &s;hewing him|&s;elf, and acting vi&s;ibly and openly, as a body u&s;ual|ly and ordinarily does.</P>
<P>Nor is it any di&s;advantage to the Devil, that his Seraphic nature is not confin'd or impri&s;on'd in a body or &s;hape, &s;uppo&s;e that &s;hape to be what mon&s;trous thing we would; for this would, indeed, confine his actings within the narrow &s;phere of the organ or body to which he was limited, and tho' you were to &s;uppo&s;e the body to have wings for a velocity of Motion equal to &s;pirit, yet if it had not a power of invi&s;ibility too, and a capacity of conveying it &s;elf, undi&s;cover'd, into all the &s;e|
<PB N="49" REF="57">
cret rece&s;&s;es of mankind, and the &s;ame &s;ecret art or capacity of in&s;inuation, &s;ugge&s;tion, accu&s;ation, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> by which his wicked de&s;igns are now propagated, and all his other devices a&s;&s;i&s;ted, by which he de|ludes and betrays mankind; I &s;ay, he would be no more a Devil, that is, a De&s;troyer, no more a De|ceiver, and no more a Satan, that is, a dangerous Arch-enemy to the &s;ouls of men; nor would it be any difficulty to mankind to &s;hun and avoid him, as I &s;hall make plain in the other part of his Hi|&s;tory.</P>
<P>Had the Devil from the beginning been embodi|ed, as he could not have been invi&s;ible to us, who&s;e &s;ouls equally &s;eraphic are only pre&s;crib'd by being embody'd and encas'd in fle&s;h and blood as we are; &s;o he would have been no more a Devil to any body but him&s;elf: The impri&s;onment in a body, had the powers of that body been all that we can con|ceive to make him formidable to us, would yet have been a Hell to him; con&s;ider him as a conquer'd exa&s;perated Rebel, retaining all that fury and &s;wel|ling ambition, that hatred of God, and envy at his creatures which dwells now in his enrag'd &s;pirits as a <HI>Devil:</HI> yet &s;uppo&s;e him to have been condemn'd to organic Powers, confin'd to corporeal motion, and re&s;train'd as a Body mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to re|&s;train a Spirit; it mu&s;t, at the &s;ame time, &s;uppo&s;e him to be effectually di&s;abled from all the me|thods he is now allow'd to make u&s;e of, for exert|ing his rage and enmity again&s;t God, any farther than as he might &s;uppo&s;e it to affect his Maker at &s;econd hand, by wounding his Glory thro' the &s;ides of his weake&s;t creature, MAN.</P>
<P>He mu&s;t, certainly, be thus confin'd, becau&s;e Body can only act upon Body, not upon Spirit; no &s;pecies being empower'd to act out of the com|pa&s;s of its own &s;phere: He might have been em|power'd, indeed, to have acted terrible and even de|&s;tructive
<PB N="50" REF="58">
things upon mankind, e&s;pecially if this body had any powers given it which mankind had not, by which man would be overmatch'd and not be in a condition of &s;elf-defence; for exam|ple, &s;uppo&s;e him to have had wings to have flown in the air; Or to be invulnerable, and that no human invention, art, or engine could hurt, en&s;nare, capti|vate, or re&s;train him.</P>
<P>But this is to &s;uppo&s;e the righteous and wi&s;e Creator to have made a creature and not be able to defend and pre&s;erve him, or have left him de|fencele&s;s to the mercy of another of his own creatures, whom he had given power to de&s;troy him; This indeed, might have occa&s;ion'd a gene|ral idolatry, and made mankind, as the <HI>Americans</HI> do to this day, wor&s;hip the <HI>Devil,</HI> that he might not hurt them; but it could not have prevented the de&s;truction of mankind, &s;uppo&s;ing the Devil to have had malice equal to his power: and he mu&s;t put on a new nature, be compa&s;&s;ionate, ge|nerous, beneficent, and &s;teadily good in &s;paring the rival enemy he was able to de&s;troy, or he mu&s;t have ruin'd mankind: <HI>In &s;hort,</HI> he mu&s;t have ceas'd to have been a Devil, and mu&s;t have rea&s;&s;um'd his orininal, Angelic, heavenly nature, fill'd with the principles of love, to delight in the Works of his Creator and bent to propagate his Glory and Inte|re&s;t; or he mu&s;t have put an end to the race of man, whom it would be in his Power to de&s;troy, and o|blige his Maker to create a new &s;pecies, or fortify the old with &s;ome kind of defence, which mu&s;t be invulnerable, and which his fiery darts could not penetrate.</P>
<P>On this occa&s;ion &s;uffer me to make an excur|&s;ion from the u&s;ual &s;tile of this Work, and with &s;ome &s;olemnity to expre&s;s my Thoughts thus:</P>
<P>How glorious is the wi&s;dom and goodne&s;s of the great Creator of the World! in thus re&s;train|ing
<PB N="51" REF="59">
the&s;e &s;eraphic OUTCASTS from the power of a&s;&s;uming human or organic bodies! which could they do, envigorating them with the &s;upernatural Powers, which, as Seraphs and Angels, they now po&s;&s;e&s;s and might exert, they would be able even to fright mankind from the face of the Earth, de|&s;troy and confound God's Creation; nay, <HI>even as they are,</HI> were not their power limited, they might de&s;troy the Creation it &s;elf, rever&s;e and over-turn nature, and put the World into a general confla|gration: But were tho&s;e immortal Spirits embodi|ed, tho' they were not permitted to confound na|ture, they would be able to harra&s;s poor, weak and defencele&s;s man out of his wits, and render him perfectly u&s;ele&s;s, either to his Maker or him&s;elf.</P>
<P>But the Dragon is chain'd, the Devil's Power is limited; he has indeed a va&s;tly extended Em|pire, being Prince of the Air, having, at lea&s;t, the whole Atmo&s;phere to range in, and how far that Atmo&s;phere is extended, is not yet a&s;certain'd by the nice&s;t ob&s;ervations; <HI>I &s;ay, at lea&s;t,</HI> becau&s;e we do not yet know how far he may be allow'd to make excur&s;ions beyond the Atmo&s;phere of this Globe into the planetary Worlds, and what power he may exerci&s;e in all the habitable parts of the <HI>&s;olar &s;y&s;tem;</HI> nay, of all the other <HI>&s;olar &s;y&s;tems,</HI> which, for ought we know, may exi&s;t in the mighty extent of created &s;pace, and of which you may hear farther in its order.</P>
<P>But let his power be what it will there, we are &s;ure 'tis limited here, and that in two particulars; fir&s;t, he is limited as above, from a&s;&s;uming body or bodily &s;hapes and &s;ub&s;tance; and &s;econdly, from exerting &s;eraphic Powers, and acting with that &s;u|pernatural force, which, as an Angel, he was cer|tainly ve&s;ted with before the fall, and which we are not certain is yet taken from him; or at mo&s;t, we do not know how much it may or may not be
<PB N="52" REF="60">
dimini&s;h'd by his degeneracy, and by the blow given him at his expul&s;ion: this we are certain, that be his Power greater or le&s;s, he is re&s;train'd from the exerci&s;e of it in this World; and he, who was once equal to the Angel who kill'd 180000 men in one night, is not able now, without a new commi&s;&s;ion, to take away the life of one <HI>Job,</HI> nor to touch anything he had.</P>
<P>But let us con&s;ider him then limited and re&s;train|ed as he is, yet he remains a mighty, a terrible, an immortal Being; infinitely &s;uperior to man, as well in the dignity of his nature, as in the dreadful powers he retains &s;till about him; and tho' the brain-&s;ick heads of our Enthu&s;ia&s;ticks paint him blacker than he is, and, as I have &s;aid, repre&s;ent him clothed with terrors that do not really be|long to him; as if the power of good and evil was wholly ve&s;ted in him, and that he was placed in the Throne of his Maker, to di&s;tribute both puni&s;hments and rewards; terrifying and deluding fanciful people about him, till they turn their heads, and fright them into a belief that the <HI>Devil</HI> will let them alone, if they do &s;uch and &s;uch good things, or carry them away with him they know not whither, if they do not; as if the <HI>Devil,</HI> who&s;e proper bu&s;ine&s;s is mi&s;chief, &s;educing and deluding mankind, and drawing him in to be a re|bel like him&s;elf, &s;hould threaten to &s;eize upon them, carry them away, and in a word, fall upon them to hurt them, if they did evil, and on the contrary, be favourable and civil to them, if they did well.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P><HI>Why no,</HI> that's true too, I don't know what to &s;ay to that; but what could it be; 'twas the Devil to be &s;ure, it could be nobody el&s;e?</P>

<P>No, no, 'twas neither the Devil, <HI>Thomas,</HI> nor any body el&s;e, but your own frighted ima|gination <HI>Thomas;</HI> you had lain with that wench, and being a young &s;inner of that kind, your Con|&s;cience terrified you, told you the Devil would fetch you away, and you would be damn'd; and you were &s;o per&s;uaded it would be &s;o, that you at la&s;t imagin'd he was come for you indeed; that you &s;aw him and heard him; whereas, you may depend upon it, if <HI>Jenny S&mdash;</HI>will let you lye with her every
<PB N="56" REF="64">
night, the Devil will hold the candle, or do any thing to forward it, but will never di&s;turb you; he's too much a friend to your wickedne&s;s, it could never be the Devil, <HI>Thomas;</HI> 'twas only your own guilt frighted you, and that was <HI>Devil</HI> enough too, if you knew the wor&s;t of it, you need no other enemy.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Tho.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why that's true, Ma&s;ter, one would think the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould not bid me repent, that's true; but certainly 'twas the Devil for all that.</P>
</SP>
<P>Now <HI>Thomas</HI> was not the only man that ha|ving committed a flagitious crime had been de|luded by his own imagination, and the power of fancy, to think the Devil was come for him; whereas the Devil, to give him his due, is too hone&s;t to pretend to &s;uch things; 'tis his bu&s;ine&s;s to per&s;uade men to offend, not to repent, and he profe&s;&s;es no other; he may pre&s;s men to this or that action, by telling them 'tis no &s;in, no offence, no breach of God's Law, and the like, when really 'tis both; but to pre&s;s them to repent, when they have offended, that's quite out of his way; 'tis none of his bu&s;ine&s;s, nor does he pretend to it; therefore, let no man charge the Devil with what he is not concern'd in.</P>
<P>But to return to his Per&s;on, he is, as I have &s;aid, notwith&s;tanding his lo&s;t glory, a mighty, a ter|rible and an immortal Spirit; he is him&s;elf call'd a Prince, <HI>the Prince of the Power of the Air;</HI> the Prince of Darkne&s;s, the Prince of <HI>Devils,</HI> and the like, and his attending Spirits are call'd <HI>his Angels:</HI> &s;o that however <HI>Satan</HI> has lo&s;t the glory and rectitude of his Nature, by his apo&s;tate &s;tate, yet he retains a greatne&s;s and magnificence, which places him above our rank, and indeed above our conception; for we know not what he is, any more than we know what the ble&s;&s;ed Angels are; of whom we can &s;ay no more than that they are
<PB N="57" REF="65">
<HI>mini&s;tring Spirits,</HI> &amp;c. as the Scripture has de|&s;crib'd them.</P>
<P>Two things, however, may give us &s;ome in|&s;ight into the nature of the Devil, in the pre&s;ent &s;tate he is in; and the&s;e we have a clear di&s;covery of in the whole &s;eries of his Conduct from the Beginning.</P>
<P N="1">1. That he is the vanqui&s;h'd but implacable ene|my of God his Creator, who has conquer'd him, and expell'd him from the habitati|ons of bli&s;s; on which account he is fill'd with envy, rage, malice, and all uncharitable|ne&s;s; would dethrone God and overturn the thrones of Heaven, if it was in his power.</P>
<P N="2">2. That he is man's irreconcilable Enemy; not as he is a man, nor on his own account &s;im|ply, nor for any advantage he (the Devil) can make by the ruin and de&s;truction of man, but in meer envy at the felicity he is &s;uppo&s;ed to enjoy as Satan's rival; and as he is appoin|ted to &s;ucceed Satan and his Angels in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e glories from which they are fallen.</P>
<P>And here I mu&s;t take upon me to &s;ay, Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> makes a wrong judgment of the rea&s;on of <HI>Satan</HI>'s re&s;olution to di&s;turb the felicity of man; He tells us it was meerly to affront God his Maker, rob him of the glory de&s;ign'd in his new work of creation, and to di&s;appoint him in his main de&s;ign, namely, the creating a new &s;pecies of creatures, in a perfect rectitude of &s;oul, and after his own image, from whom he might ex|pect a new Fund of glory &s;hould be rais'd, and who was to appear as the triumph of the Me&s;&s;iah's victory over the Devil. In all which Satan could not be fool enough not to know that he &s;hould
<PB N="58" REF="66">
be di&s;appointed by the &s;ame Power which had &s;o eminently counter-acted his rage before.</P>
<P>But, I believe, the Devil went upon a much more probable de&s;ign; and tho' he may be &s;aid to act upon a meaner principle than that of pointing his rage at the per&s;onal glory of his Creator; yet I own, that in my opinion, it was by much the more rational undertaking, and more likely to &s;uc|ceed, and that was, that whereas he perceived this new &s;pecies of creatures had a &s;ublime as well as a human part, and were made capable of po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the man&s;ions of eternal Beatitude, from whence, he <HI>(Satan)</HI> and his Angels were expell'd and irre|trievably bani&s;h'd; envy at &s;uch a rival mov'd him by all po&s;&s;ible artifice, <HI>for he &s;aw him deprived of capacity to do it by force,</HI> to render him unworthy like him&s;elf; and that bringing him to fall into re|bellion and di&s;obedience, he might &s;ee his rival damn'd with him; and tho&s;e who were intended to fill up the empty &s;paces in Heaven, made &s;o by the ab&s;ence of &s;o many millions of fallen Angels, be ca&s;t out into the &s;ame darkne&s;s with them.</P>
<P>How he came to know that this new &s;pecies of creatures were liable to &s;uch imperfection, is be&s;t explain'd by the <HI>Devil</HI>'s prying, vigilant di&s;po&s;i|tion, judging or leading him to judge by him&s;elf; for he was as near being infallible as any of God's creatures had been, and then inclining him to try whether it was &s;o or no.</P>
<P>Modern Naturali&s;ts, e&s;pecially &s;ome who have not &s;o large a charity for the fair &s;ex, as I have, tell us, that as &s;oon as ever Satan &s;aw the woman, and look'd in her face, he &s;aw it evidently that &s;he was the be&s;t form'd creature to make a fool of, and the be&s;t to make a hypocrite of, that could be made, and therefore the mo&s;t fitted for his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P N="1">1. He &s;aw by &s;ome thwart lines in her face, (legible, perhaps, to him&s;elf only) that there was
<PB N="59" REF="67">
a throne ready prepar'd for the &s;in of pride to &s;it in &s;tate upon, e&s;pecially if it took an early po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion: EVE you may &s;uppo&s;e was a perfect Beauty, if ever &s;uch a thing may be &s;uppo&s;ed in the human frame; her figure being &s;o extraordinary, was the groundwork of his project; there needed no more than to bring her to be vain of it, and to conceit that it either was &s;o, or was infinitely more &s;ub|lime and beautiful than it really was; and having thus tickl'd her vanity, to introduce Pride gradu|ally, till at la&s;t he might per&s;uade her, that &s;he was really Angelic, or of heavenly Race, and wanted nothing but to eat the forbidden fruit, and that would make her &s;omething more excel|lent &s;till.</P>
<P N="2">2. Looking farther into her Frame, and with a nearer view to her imperfections, he &s;aw room to conclude that &s;he was of a con&s;titution ea&s;y to be &s;educ'd, and e&s;pecially by flattering her, rai&s;|ing a commotion in her Soul, and a di&s;turbance among her pa&s;&s;ions; and accordingly he &s;et him|&s;elf to work, to di&s;turb her repo&s;e, and put dreams of great things into her head; together with &s;omething of a namele&s;s nature, which (however, &s;ome have been ill-natur'd enough to &s;ugge&s;t) I &s;hall not injure the Devil &s;o much as to men|tion, without better evidence.</P>
<P N="3">3. But, be&s;ides this, he found, upon the very fir&s;t &s;urvey of her out&s;ide, &s;omething &s;o very charming in her mein and behaviour, &s;o engag|ing as well as agreeable in the whole texture of her per&s;on, and withal &s;uch a &s;prightly wit, &s;uch a vivacity of parts, &s;uch a fluency of tongue, and above all, &s;uch a winning prevailing whine in her &s;miles, or at lea&s;t in her tears, that he made no doubt if he could but once delude her, &s;he would ea&s;ily be brought to delude <HI>Adam,</HI> whom he found &s;et not only a great value upon her per&s;on, but
<PB N="60" REF="68">
was perfectly captivated by her charms; in a word, he &s;aw plainly, that if he could but ruin her, he &s;hould ea&s;ily make a Devil of her, to ruin her husband, and draw him into any gulph of mis|chief, were it ever &s;o black and dreadful, that &s;he &s;hould fir&s;t fall into her&s;elf; how far &s;ome may be wicked enough, from hence, to &s;ugge&s;t of the <HI>fair &s;ex,</HI> that they have been Devils to their hus|bands ever &s;ince, I cannot &s;ay; I hope they will not be &s;o unmerciful to di&s;cover truths of &s;uch fatal con&s;equence, tho' they &s;hould come to their knowledge.</P>
<P>Thus &s;ubtle and penetrating has Satan been from the beginning; and who can wonder that upon the&s;e di&s;coveries made into the woman's in&s;ide, he went immediately to work with her, rather than with <HI>Adam?</HI> not but that one would think, if <HI>Adam</HI> was fool enough to be deluded by his wife, the Devil might have &s;een &s;o much of it in his countenance, as to have encourag'd him to make his attack directly upon him, and not go round about, beating the bu&s;h, and ploughing with the Heifer; &s;etting upon the woman fir&s;t, and then &s;etting her upon her husband, who might as ea&s;ily have been impo&s;ed upon as &s;he.</P>
<P>Other Commentators upon this critical Text &s;ugge&s;t to us, that <HI>Eve</HI> was not &s;o plea&s;ed with the hopes of being made a Godde&s;s; That the pride of a Seraphic Knowlegde did not &s;o much work upon her imagination to bring her to con&s;ent, as a certain &s;ecret Notion infus'd into her head by the &s;ame wicked in&s;trument, that &s;he &s;hould be wi&s;er than <HI>Adam,</HI> and &s;hould by the &s;uperio|rity of her under&s;tanding, nece&s;&s;arily have the government over him; which, at pre&s;ent, &s;he was &s;en&s;ible &s;he had not, he being ma&s;ter of a parti|cular air of gravity and maje&s;ty, as well as of &s;trength, infinitely &s;uperior to her.</P>
<P><PB N="61" REF="69">
This is an ill-natur'd &s;ugge&s;tion; but it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd the impatient de&s;ire of government, which (&s;ince that) appears in the general behaviour of the &s;ex, and particularly of governing husbands, leaves too much room to legitimate the &s;uppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>The Philo&s;ophers and Expo&s;itors, who are of this opinion, add to it, that this being her origi|nal crime, or the particular temptation to that crime; Heaven thought fit to &s;hew his ju&s;tice, in making her more entire &s;ubjection to her hus|band be a part of the Cur&s;e, that &s;he might read her &s;in in the puni&s;hment, <HI>(viz.) he &s;hall rule over thee.</HI></P>
<P>I only give the general hint of the&s;e things as they appear recorded in the annals of <HI>Satan</HI>'s fir&s;t Tyranny, and at the beginning of his govern|ment in the World; tho&s;e that would be more particularly inform'd, may enquire of him <HI>and know farther.</HI></P>
<P>I cannot however, but ob&s;erve here <HI>with &s;ome regret,</HI> how it appears by the con&s;equence, that the Devil was not mi&s;taken when he made an early judgment of Mrs. <HI>Eve;</HI> and how <HI>Satan</HI> really went the right way to work, to judge of her; 'tis certain the Devil had nothing to do but to look in her face, and upon a near &s;teady view he might ea&s;ily &s;ee there, an in&s;trument for his Turn; nor has he fail'd to make her a Tool ever &s;ince, by the very methods which he at fir&s;t pro|po&s;ed; to which, perhaps, he has made &s;ome ad|ditions in the corrupting her compo&s;ition, as well as her under&s;tanding; qualifying her to be a com|pleat &s;nare to the poor <HI>weaker ve&s;&s;el</HI> MAN; to wheedle him with her <HI>Syren</HI>'s voice, abu&s;e him with her &s;miles, delude him with her crocodile tears, and &s;ometimes cock her crown at him, and ter|rify him with the thunder of her TREBBLE; ma|king the effeminated <HI>Male Apple-eater</HI> tremble at the
<PB N="62" REF="70">
noi&s;e of that very Tongue, which at fir&s;t com|manded him to Sin. For it is yet a debate which the Learned have not decided, whether &s;he per|&s;uaded and entreated him, or like a true &s;he-ty|rant, exerci&s;ed her authority and oblig'd him to eat the forbidden fruit.</P>
<P>And therefore a certain author, who&s;e name, <HI>for fear of the Sex's re&s;entment</HI> I conceal, brings her in, calling to <HI>Adam</HI> at a great di&s;tance, in an Imperious haughty manner, beckoning to him with her hand, thus; <HI>Here,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>you coward|ly faint-hearted wretch, take this branch of heaven|ly fruit, eat and be a &s;tupid fool no longer; eat and be wi&s;e; eat and be a God; and know, to your eternal &s;hame, that your wife has been made an enlightn'd Godde&s;s before you.</HI></P>
<P>He tells you <HI>Adam</HI> hung back a little at fir&s;t, and trembl'd, <HI>afraid to tre&s;pa&s;s: What ails the</HI> SOT, &s;ays the new Termagant? <HI>what are you afraid of? did God forbid you! yes, and why? that we might not be knowing and wi&s;e like him&s;elf!

<HEAD>CHAP. V. <HI>Of the &s;tation Satan had in Heaven before he fell; the nature and original of his crime, and &s;ome of Mr.</HI> Milton<HI>'s mi&s;takes about it.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THUS far I have gone upon general ob&s;er|vation in this great affair of <HI>Satan</HI> and his Empire in this World; I now come to <HI>my Title,</HI> and &s;hall enter upon the hi&s;torical part, as the main work before me.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides what has been &s;aid Poetically, relating to the fall and wandering condition of the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Ho&s;t, which poetical part I offer only as an excur&s;ion, and de&s;ire it &s;hould be taken &s;o; I &s;hall give you what I think is deduc'd from good originals on the part of <HI>Satan</HI>'s &s;tory in a few words.</P>
<P>He was one of the created Angels, form'd by the &s;ame omnipotent hand and glorious power,
<PB N="64" REF="72">
who created the Heavens and the Earth, and all that is therein: This innumerable heavenly Ho&s;t, as we have rea&s;on to believe, contain'd Angels of higher and lower &s;tations, of greater and of le&s;&s;er degree, expre&s;s'd in the Scripture by <HI>Thrones, Do|minions,</HI> and <HI>Principalities:</HI> This, I think, we have as much rea&s;on to believe, as we have, that there are Stars in the Firmament (or &s;tarry Heavens) of greater and of le&s;&s;er magnitude.</P>
<P>What particular &s;tation among the immortal Choir of Angels, this Arch-&s;eraph, this Prince of <HI>Devils,</HI> call'd <HI>Satan,</HI> was plac'd in before his ex|pul&s;ion, that indeed, we cannot come at the knowledge of, at lea&s;t, not with &s;uch an Autho|rity as may be depended upon; but as from Scrip|ture-authority, he is plac'd at the head of all the Apo&s;tate armies, after he was fallen, we cannot think it in the lea&s;t a&s;&s;uming to &s;ay, that he might be &s;uppos'd to be one of the principal Agents in the <HI>Rebellion</HI> which happen'd in Heaven, and con&s;equently that he might be one of the highe&s;t in dignity there, before that Rebellion.</P>
<P>The higher his &s;tation, the lower, and with the greater precipitation, was his overthrow; and therefore, tho&s;e words, tho' taken in another &s;en&s;e, may very well be apply'd to him: <HI>How art thou fallen, O</HI> Lucifer! <HI>Son of the Morning!</HI></P>
<P>Having granted the dignity of his Per&s;on, and the high &s;tation in which he was placed among the heavenly Ho&s;t; it would come then nece&s;&s;ari|ly to inquire into the nature of his fall, and <HI>above all,</HI> a little into the rea&s;on of it; certain it is, <HI>he did fall,</HI> was guilty of Rebellion and Di&s;obedience, the ju&s;t effect of Pride, &s;ins, which, in that holy place, might well be call'd wonderful.</P>
<P>But what to me is more wonderful, and which, I think, will be very ill accounted for, is, how came &s;eeds of crime to ri&s;e in the Angelic Nature?
<PB N="65" REF="73">
created in a &s;tate of perfect, un&s;potted holine&s;s? how was it fir&s;t found in a place where no unclean thing can enter? how came ambition, pride, or envy to generate there? could there be offence where there was no crime? could untainted puri|ty breed corruption? could the nature contami|nate and infect, which was always partakingnouri|&s;hment from, and taking in principles of per|fection?</P>
<P>Happy 'tis to me, <HI>that</HI> writing the Hi&s;tory, <HI>not</HI> &s;olving the Difficulties of <HI>Satan</HI>'s Affairs, is my province in this Work; that I am to relate the Fact, not give rea&s;ons for it, or a&s;&s;ign cau&s;es; if it was otherwi&s;e, I &s;hould break off at this difficulty, for I acknowledge I do not &s;ee thro' it, neither do I think that the great <HI>Milton,</HI> after all his fine Ima|ges and lofty Excur&s;ions upon the Subject, has left it one jot clearer than he found it: Some are of opinion, and among them the great Dr. <HI>B&mdash;s,</HI> that crime broke in upon them at &s;ome interval, when they omitted but one moment fixing their eyes and thoughts on the glories of the divine face, to admire and adore, which is the full em|ployment of Angels; but even this, tho' it goes as high as imagination can carry us, does not reach it, nor, to me, make it one jot more comprehen|&s;ible than it was before; all I can &s;ay to it here, is, that <HI>&s;o it was,</HI> the fact was upon Record, and the re|jected Troop are in being, who&s;e circum&s;tances con|fe&s;s the Guilt, and &s;till groan under the Puni&s;hment.</P>

<P>Thus, as I told you, I only moralize upon the &s;ubject, but as to the difficulty, I mu&s;t leave it as I find it, unle&s;s, <HI>as I hinted at fir&s;t,</HI> I could pre|vail with Satan to &s;et pen to paper, and write this part of his own Hi&s;tory: No que&s;tion, but he could let us into the &s;ecret; but to be plain, I doubt I &s;hall tell &s;o many plain truths of the <HI>Devil,</HI> in this Hi&s;tory, and di&s;cover &s;o many of his &s;ecrets, which it is not for his intere&s;t to have di&s;|cover'd, that before I have done, the <HI>Devil</HI> and I may not be &s;o good friends as you may &s;uppo&s;e we are; at lea&s;t, not friends enough to obtain &s;uch a favour of him, tho' it be for public good; &s;o we mu&s;t be content till we come a t'other &s;ide the <HI>Blue-blancket,</HI> and then we &s;hall know the whole Story.</P>
<P>But now, tho', as I &s;aid, I will not attempt to &s;olve the difficulty, I may, I hope, venture to tell you, that there is not &s;o much difficulty in it, as at fir&s;t &s;ight appears, and e&s;pecially not &s;o much as &s;ome people would make us believe; let us &s;ee how others are mi&s;taken in it, perhaps, that may help us a little in the enquiry; for to know <HI>what it is not,</HI> is one help towards knowing <HI>what it is.</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> has indeed told us a great many mer|ry things of the Devil, in a mo&s;t formal, &s;olemn manner; till in &s;hort he has made a good PLAY of <HI>Heaven</HI> and <HI>Hell;</HI> and no doubt if he had liv'd in our times, he might have had it acted with our <HI>Pluto</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;erpine.</HI> He has made fine Speeches

<P>I confe&s;s I don't well know how far the do|minion of Poetry extends it&s;elf; it &s;eems the Buts and Bounds of <HI>Parna&s;&s;us</HI> are not yet a&s;certain'd; &s;o that for ought I know, by vertue of their an|tient privileges call'd <HI>Licentia Poetarum,</HI> there can be no <HI>Bla&s;phemy</HI> in <HI>Ver&s;e,</HI> as &s;ome of our Divines &s;ay there can be no <HI>Trea&s;on</HI> in the <HI>Pulpit.</HI> But they that will venture to write that way, ought to be better &s;atisfy'd about that Point than I am.</P>
<P>Upon this foot Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> to grace his Poem, and give room for his Towring Fancy, has gone a length beyond all that ever went before him, &s;ince <HI>Ovid</HI> in his <HI>Metamorpho&s;is.</HI> He has indeed complimented GOD <HI>Almighty</HI> with a flux of lofty words, and great &s;ounds, and has made a very fine Story of the <HI>Devil,</HI> but he has made a meer <HI>je ne &s;&ccedil;ay Quoi</HI> of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> In one line he has him riding on a <HI>Cherub,</HI> and in ano|ther &s;itting on a Throne, both in the very &s;ame moment of action. In another place he has brought him in making a Speech to his <HI>Saints,</HI> when 'tis evident he had none there; for we all know <HI>Man was not created till a long while after;</HI> and no body can be &s;o dull as to &s;ay the <HI>Angels</HI> may be called <HI>Saints,</HI> without the greate&s;t ab&s;ur|dity in nature. Be&s;ides, he makes CHRIST him|&s;elf di&s;tingui&s;h them, as in two &s;everal Bands, and of differing Per&s;ons and Species, as to be &s;ure they are.

So that CHRIST here is brought in drawing up his Army before the la&s;t Battel, and making a Speech to them, to tell them they &s;hall only &s;tand by in warlike order, but that they &s;hall have no oc|ca&s;ion to fight, for he alone will engage the Re|bels. Then in embattling his Legions, he places the Saints here, and the Angels there, as if one were the main Battel of Infantry, and the other the Wings of Cavalry. But who are tho&s;e Saints? they are indeed all of his own making, for 'tis certain there were no Saints at all in <HI>Heaven</HI> or <HI>Earth</HI> at that time; GOD and his <HI>Angels</HI> fill'd up the place; and till &s;ome of the <HI>Angels</HI> fell, and Men were created, had liv'd, and were dead, there could have been no <HI>Saints</HI> there. Saint <HI>Abel</HI> was certainly the <HI>Proto&s;aint</HI> of all that ever were &s;een in <HI>Heaven,</HI> as well as the Protomartyr of all that have been upon <HI>Earth.</HI></P>
<P>Ju&s;t &s;uch another Mi&s;take, not to call it a Blun|der, he makes about <HI>Hell;</HI> which he not only makes LOCAL, but gives it a being before the Fall of the <HI>Angels,</HI> and brings it in opening its mouth to receive them. This is &s;o contrary to the na|ture of the thing, and &s;o great an ab&s;urdity, that no poetic Licen&s;e can account for it; for tho' Poe&s;ie may form Stories, as Idea and Fancy may furni&s;h Materials, yet Poe&s;y mu&s;t not break in upon Chro|nology, and make things which in time were to exi&s;t, act before they exi&s;ted.</P>
<P>Thus a Painter may make a fine piece of Work, the fancy may be good, the &s;trokes ma&s;terly, and the beauty of the Workman&s;hip inimitably curi|ous and fine, and yet have &s;ome unpardonable im|proprieties which marrs the whole Work. So the famous Painter of <HI>Toledo</HI> painted the &s;tory of the three Wi&s;emen of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> coming to wor|&s;hip, and bring their pre&s;ents to our Lord upon his birth at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> where he repre&s;ents them as

three <HI>Arabian</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> Kings; two of them are white, and one black; But unhappily when he drew the latter part of them kneeling, which to be &s;ure was done after their faces; their legs being nece&s;&s;arily a little intermix'd, he made three black feet for the <HI>Negroe</HI> King, and but three white feet for the two white Kings, and yet never di&s;co|ver'd the mi&s;take till the piece was pre&s;ented to the King, and hung up in the great Church. As this is an unpardonable error in Sculpture or Lim|ning, it mu&s;t be much more &s;o in Poetry, where the Images mu&s;t have no improprieties, much le&s;s incon&s;i&s;tencies.</P>
<P>In a word, Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> has indeed made a fine Poem, but it is <HI>the Devil of a Hi&s;tory.</HI> I can ea|&s;ily allow Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> to make Hills and Dales, flowry Meadows and Plains (and the like) in Hea|ven; and places of Retreat and Contemplation in <HI>Hell;</HI> tho' I mu&s;t add it can be allow'd to no Poet on Earth but Mr. <HI>Milton.</HI> Nay, I will allow Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> if you plea&s;e, to &s;et the <HI>Angels</HI> a dancing in <HI>Heaven, lib.</HI> v. <HI>fo.</HI> 138. and the <HI>Devils</HI> a &s;ing|ing in Hell, <HI>lib.</HI> i. <HI>fo.</HI> 44. tho' they are in &s;hort, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, mo&s;t horrid Ab&s;urdities. But I cannot allow him to make their Mu&s;ic in <HI>Hell</HI> to be harmonious and charming as he does; &s;uch Images being incongruous, and indeed &s;hocking to Nature. Neither can I think we &s;hould allow things to be plac'd out of time in Poetry, any more than in Hi&s;tory; 'tis confu&s;ion of Images which is al|low'd to be di&s;allow'd by all the Criticks of what tribe or &s;pecies &s;oever in the world, and is indeed unpardonable. But we &s;hall find &s;o many more of the&s;e things in Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> that really taking notice of them all, would carry me quite out of my way, I being at this time not writing the Hi&s;tory of Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> but of the <HI>Devil:</HI> be&s;ides,

Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> is &s;uch a celebrated Man, that who but he that can write the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Devil</HI> dare meddle with him?</P>
<P>But to come back to the bu&s;ine&s;s. As I had cau|tion'd you again&s;t running to Scripture for &s;hel|ter in ca&s;es of difficulty, Scripture weighing ve|ry little among the people I am directing my Speech to, &s;o indeed Scripture gives but very lit|tle light into any thing of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Story before his Fall, and but <HI>to very little</HI> of it for &s;ome time after.</P>
<P>Nor has Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> &s;aid one word to &s;olve the main difficulty <HI>(viz.)</HI> How the <HI>Devil</HI> came to fall, and how Sin came into Heaven, and how the &s;potle&s;s &s;eraphic Nature could receive infection, whence the contagion proceeded, what noxious matter could emit corruption, how and whence any vapour to poi&s;on the Angelic Frame could ri&s;e up, or how it increas'd and grew up to crime. But all this he pa&s;&s;es over, and hurrying up that part in two or three words, only tells us,</P>

Here we mu&s;t bid Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> good night; for, in plain terms, he is in the dark about it, and &s;o we are all; and the mo&s;t that can be &s;aid, is, that we know the fact is &s;o, but nothing of the na|ture or rea&s;on of it.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="81">
But to come to the Hi&s;tory: The Angels fell, they &s;inn'd (wonderful!) in Heaven, and God ca&s;t them out; what their &s;in was is not explicit, but in general 'tis call'd a Rebellion again&s;t GOD; all &s;in mu&s;t be &s;o.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> here takes upon him to give the Hi|&s;tory of it, as particularly as if he had been born there, and came down hither on purpo&s;e to give us an account of it; (I hope he is better inform'd by this time;) but this he does in &s;uch a manner, as jo&s;tles with Religion, and &s;hocks our Faith in &s;o many points nece&s;&s;ary to be believ'd, that we mu&s;t forbear to give up to <HI>Milton,</HI> or mu&s;t &s;et a&s;ide part of the &s;acred Text, in &s;uch a manner, as will a&s;&s;i&s;t &s;ome people to &s;et it a&s;ide all.</P>
<P>I mean by this, his invented Scheme of the Son's being declared in Heaven to be begotten then, and then to be declar'd Generali&s;&s;imo of all the Armics of Heaven; and of the Father's &s;ummon|ing all the Angels of the heavenly Ho&s;t to &s;ub|mit to him, and pay him homage. The words are quoted already, page 32.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t own the Invention, indeed, is very fine, the Images exceeding magnificent, the Thought rich and bright, and, in &s;ome re&s;pect, truly &s;ub|lime: But the Authorities fail mo&s;t wretchedly, and the mi&s;s-timing of it is un&s;ufferably gro&s;s, as is noted in the Introduction to this Work; for Chri&s;t is not declar'd the Son of God but on Earth; 'tis true, 'tis &s;poken from Heaven, but then 'tis &s;poken as perfected on Earth; if it was at all to be a&s;&s;ign'd to Heaven, it was from Eterni|ty, and there, indeed, his eternal Generation is al|low'd; but to take upon us to &s;ay, that <HI>On a day, a certain day,</HI> for &s;o our Poet a&s;&s;umes, lib. v. &s;ol. 137.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&mdash;When on a day,&mdash;On &s;uch a day

As Heaven's great Year brings forth, the empy|real Ho&s;t Of Angels by imperial Summons call'd,&endq; Forthwith from all the ends of Heaven appear'd.</Q></P>
<P>This is, indeed, too gro&s;s; at this meeting he makes God declare the Son to be <HI>that day begot|ten,</HI> as before; had he made him not begotten that day, but declared General that day, it would be reconcileable with Scripture and with &s;en&s;e; for either the begetting is meant of ordaining to an office, or el&s;e the eternal Generation falls to the ground; and if it was to the office (Mediator) then Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> is out in a&s;cribing another fix'd day to the Work; &s;ee lib. x. fo. 194. But then the declaring him <HI>that day,</HI> is wrong chronology too, for Chri&s;t is declar'd <HI>the Son of God with power,</HI> only by the Re&s;urrection of the dead, and this is both a Declaration in Heaven and in Earth. <HI>Rom.</HI> i. 4. And <HI>Milton</HI> can have no authority to tell us, there was any Declaration of it in Heaven be|fore this, except it be that dull authority, call'd <HI>poetic Licen&s;e,</HI> which will not pa&s;s in &s;o &s;olemn an affair as that.</P>
<P>But the thing was nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>Milton,</HI> who wanted to a&s;&s;ign &s;ome cau&s;e or original of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Rebellion; and &s;o, <HI>as I &s;aid above,</HI> the de|&s;ign is well laid, it only wants two Trifles call'd <HI>Truth</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;tory;</HI> &s;o I leave it to &s;truggle for it &s;elf.</P>
<P>This Ground-plot being laid, he has a fair field for the <HI>Devil</HI> to play the Rebel in, for he imme|diately brings him in, not &s;atisfy'd with the Ex|altation of the Son of God. The ca&s;e mu&s;t be thus; <HI>Satan</HI> being an eminent <HI>Arch-angel,</HI> and perhaps, the highe&s;t of all the Angelic Train, hearing this &s;overeign Declaration, that the <HI>Son</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="83">
<HI>of God</HI> was declar'd to be Head or Generali&s;&s;imo of all the heavenly Ho&s;t, took it ill to &s;ee another put into the high &s;tation <HI>over his head,</HI> as the Sol|diers call it; he, perhaps, being the &s;enior Officer, and di&s;daining to &s;ubmit to any but to his former immediate Sovereign; in &s;hort, he threw up his Commi&s;&s;ion, and, in order not to be compel'd to obey, revolted and broke out in open Rebellion.</P>
<P>All this part is a Decoration noble and great, nor is there any objection to be made again&s;t the invention, becau&s;e a deduction of probable Events; but the Plot is wrong laid, as is ob&s;erv'd above, becau&s;e contradicted by the Scripture account, according to which Chri&s;t was declared in Hea|ven, not then, but from Eternity, and not decla|red with power, but on Earth, <HI>(viz.)</HI> in his victory over Sin and Death, by the Re&s;urrection from the dead; &s;o that Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> is not orthodox in this part, but lays an avow'd foundation for the cor|rupt Doctrine of <HI>Arius,</HI> which &s;ays, there was a time when Chri&s;t <HI>was not</HI> the Son of GOD.</P>
<P>But to leave Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> to his flights, I agree with him in this part, <HI>viz.</HI> that the wicked or &s;inning Angels, with the great Arch-angel at the head of them, revolted from their obedience, even in Heaven it &s;elf; that <HI>Satan</HI> began the wicked defection, and being a Chief among the Heavenly Ho&s;t, con&s;equently carry'd over a great party with him, who all together rebel'd again&s;t God; that upon this Rebellion they were &s;entenc'd, by the righteous judgment of God, to be expel'd the holy Habitation; this, be&s;ides the authority of Scripture, we have vi&s;ible te&s;timonies of, from the Devils them&s;elves; their influences and ope|rations among us every day, of which Mankind are witne&s;&s;es; in all the merry things they do in his name, and under his protection, in almo&s;t every &s;cene of life they pa&s;s thro', whether we talk of
<PB N="76" REF="84">
things done openly or in Ma&s;querade, things done in&mdash;or out of it, things done in earne&s;t or in je&s;t.</P>
<P>But then, what comes of the long and bloody War that Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> gives &s;uch a full and parti|cular account of, and the terrible Battels in Hea|ven between <HI>Michael</HI> with the royal Army of An|gels on one hand, and <HI>Satan</HI> with his rebel Ho&s;t on the other; in which he &s;uppo&s;es the numbers and &s;trength to be pretty near equal? but at length brings in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Army, upon doubling their rage and bringing new engines of war into the field, putting <HI>Michael</HI> and all the faithful Army to the wor&s;t; and, in a word, defeats them? For tho' they were not put to a plain flight, in which ca&s;e he mu&s;t, at lea&s;t, have given an account of two or three thou&s;and millions of Angels cut in pieces and wounded, yet he allows them to give over the fight, and make a kind of retreat; &s;o making way for the compleat victory of the Son of GOD: Now this is all invention, or at lea&s;t, a borrow'd thought from the old Poets, and the fight of the <HI>Giants</HI> again&s;t <HI>Jupiter,</HI> &s;o nobly de|&s;ign'd by <HI>Ovid,</HI> almo&s;t two thou&s;and year ago; and there 'twas well enough; but whether Poetic Fancy &s;hould be allow'd to fable upon <HI>Heaven,</HI> or no, and upon the King of Heaven too, that I leave to the Sages.</P>
<P>By this expul&s;ion of the <HI>Devils,</HI> it is allow'd by mo&s;t Authors, they are, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> &s;tript of the Rectitude and Holine&s;s of their Nature, which was their Beauty and Perfection; and being in|gulph'd in the aby&s;s of irrecoverable ruin, <HI>'tis no matter where,</HI> from that very time they lo&s;t their Angelic beautiful Form, and commenc'd ugly frightful Mon&s;ters and <HI>Devils,</HI> and became evil doers, as well as evil Spirits; fill'd with a horrid malignity and enmity again&s;t their Maker, and arm'd with a helli&s;h re&s;olution to &s;hew and ex|ert

it on all occa&s;ions; retaining however their exalted &s;pirituous Nature, and having a va&s;t ex|ten&s;ive power of Action, all which they can ex|ert in nothing el&s;e but doing evil, for they are en|tirely dive&s;ted of either Power or will to do good; and even in doing evil, they are under re&s;traints and limitations of a &s;uperior Power, which it is their Torment, and, perhaps, a great part of their Hell that they cannot break thro'.</P>

<P>HAVING thus brought the <HI>Devil</HI> and his innumerable Legions to the edge of the Bottomle&s;s-pit, it remains, before I bring them to action, that &s;ome enquiry &s;hould be made into the po&s;ture of their affairs immediately after their precipitate Fall, and into the place of their im|mediate Re&s;idence; for this will appear to be very nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>Satan</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, and indeed, &s;o as that without it, all the farther account we have to give of him will be incon&s;i&s;tent and imperfect.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, I take upon me to lay down &s;ome Fundamentals, which I believe I &s;hall be able to make out Hi&s;torically, tho', perhaps, not &s;o Geogra|phically as &s;ome have pretended to do.</P>
<P N="1">1. That <HI>Satan</HI> was not immediately, nor is yet lock'd down into the Aby&s;s of a <HI>local Hell,</HI> &s;uch as is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome, and &s;uch as he &s;hall be at la&s;t; or that,</P>
<P N="2"><PB N="78" REF="86">
2. If he was, he has certain liberties allowed him for excur&s;ions into the Regions of this Air, and certain &s;pheres of action, in which he can, and does move, to do <HI>like a very Devil as he is,</HI> all the mi&s;chief he can, and of which we &s;ee &s;o many examples both about us and in us; in the inquiry after which, I &s;hall take occa&s;i|on to examine whether the Devil is not in mo&s;t of us, &s;ometimes, if not in all of us one time or other.</P>
<P N="3">3. That <HI>Satan</HI> has no particular re&s;idence in this Globe or Earth where we live; that he rambles about among us, and marches over and over our whole country, he and his Devils in <HI>Camps volant;</HI> but that he pitches his grand Army or chief Encampment in our Adjacencies or Frontiers, which the Philo&s;o|phers call <HI>Atmo&s;phere,</HI> and whence he is call'd the Prince of the Power of that Ele|ment or part of the World we call <HI>Air;</HI> from whence he &s;ends out his Spies, his Agents and Emi&s;&s;aries, to get intelligence, and to carry his Commi&s;&s;ions to his tru&s;ty and well beloved Cou&s;ins and Coun&s;ellors on Earth, by which his bu&s;ine&s;s is done, and his affairs carried on in the World.</P>
<P>Here, again, I meet Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> full in my face, who will have it, that <HI>the Devil,</HI> immediately at his expul&s;ion, roll'd down directly into a Hell proper and local; nay, he mea&s;ures the very di|&s;tance, at lea&s;t gives the length of the journey by the time they were pa&s;&s;ing or falling, which, he &s;ays, was <HI>nine days;</HI> a good Poetical flight, but neither founded on Scripture or Philo&s;ophy, for he might every jot as well have brought <HI>Hell</HI> up to the Walls of <HI>Heaven,</HI> advanc'd to receive them, or he ought to have con&s;ider'd the &s;pace which

Hell is here &s;uppo&s;ed to be a place; nay a place created for the puni&s;hment of Angels and Men, and likewi&s;e created long before tho&s;e had fallen, or the&s;e had Being; this makes me &s;ay, Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> was a good Poet, but a bad Hi&s;torian: <HI>To|phet</HI> was prepar'd of old, indeed, but it was for the King, that is to &s;ay, it was prepar'd for tho&s;e who&s;e lot it &s;hould be to come there; but this does not at all &s;uppo&s;e it was prepar'd before it was re&s;olv'd whether there &s;hould be &s;ubjects for it, or no; el&s;e we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e both Men and An|gels were made by the glorious and upright Ma|ker

of all things, on purpo&s;e for de&s;truction, which would be incongruous and ab&s;urd.</P>
<P>But there is wor&s;e yet to come, for in the next place he adds, that <HI>Hell</HI> having receiv'd them, clos'd upon them; that is to &s;ay, took them in, clos'd or &s;hut its Mouth; and in a word, they were lock'd in, as it was &s;aid in another place, they were lock'd in, and the Key is carry'd up to Hea|ven and kept there, for <HI>we know</HI> the Angel came down from Heaven, having the Key of the Bot|tomle&s;s-pit; but fir&s;t, &s;ee Mr. <HI>Milton.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Nine days they fell, confounded chaos roar'd And felt ten-fold confu&s;ion in their fall:&mdash;Hell at la&s;t Yawning receiv'd them all, and on them clos'd; Down from the verge of Heaven, eternal wrath Burnt after them&mdash;&endq;Unquenchable.</Q></P>
<P>This Scheme is certainly deficient, if not ab|&s;urd, and I think is more &s;o than any other he has laid; 'tis evident, neither <HI>Satan</HI> or his Ho&s;t of <HI>Devils</HI> are, <HI>no not any of them,</HI> yet, even now, confin'd in the eternal Pri&s;on, where the Scrip|ture &s;ays, he &s;hall be <HI>re&s;erved in chains of darkne&s;s.</HI> They mu&s;t have mean thoughts of <HI>Hell,</HI> as a Pri|&s;on, a <HI>local</HI> Confinement, that can &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> able to break Gaol, knock off his Fetters, and come abroad, if he had been once lock'd in there, as Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> &s;ays he was: Now we know that he is abroad again, he pre&s;ented him&s;elf be|fore <HI>God,</HI> among his neighbours, when <HI>Job</HI>'s ca&s;e came to be di&s;cours'd of; and more than $hat, it's plain he was a pri&s;oner at large, by his an&s;wer to God's que&s;tion, which was, <HI>whence come&s;t thou?</HI> to which he an&s;wer'd, <HI>from going to and fro thro'</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="89">
<HI>the Earth,</HI> &amp;c. this, I &s;ay, is plain, and if it be as certain that Hell clo&s;ed upon them, I demand then, how got he out? and why was there not a Proclamation for apprehending him, as there u&s;ual|ly is, after &s;uch Rogues as break out of pri&s;on?</P>
<P>In &s;hort, the true Account of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Cir|cum&s;tances, &s;ince his Fall from <HI>Heaven,</HI> is much more likely to be thus: That he is more of a Vagrant than a Pri&s;oner, that he is a Wanderer in the wild unbounded Wa&s;t, where he and his Legions, like the Hoords of <HI>Tartary,</HI> who, in the wild Coun|tries of <HI>Karakathay,</HI> the De&s;arts of <HI>Barkan Ca&s;&s;an</HI> and <HI>A&s;tracan,</HI> live up and down where they find proper; &s;o Satan and his innumerable Legions rove about <HI>hic &amp; ubique,</HI> pitching their Camps (being Bea&s;ts of prey) where they find the mo&s;t Spoil; watching over this World, (and all the other Worlds for ought we know, and if there are any &s;uch,) I &s;ay watching, and &s;eeking who they may devour, <HI>that is,</HI> who they may deceive and delude, and &s;o de&s;troy, for devour they cannot.</P>
<P><HI>Satan</HI> being thus confin'd to a vagabond, wan|dring, un&s;ettl'd Condition, is without any certain Abode; For tho' he has, in con&s;equence of his An|gelic Nature, a kind of Empire in the liquid Wa&s;t or <HI>Air;</HI> yet, this is certainly part of his Puni&s;hment, that he is continually hovering over this inhabited Globe of Earth, &s;welling with the Rage of Envy, at the Felicity of his Rival, Man, and &s;tudying all the means po&s;&s;ible to injure and ruine him; but ex|tremely limited in Power, to his un&s;peakable Mor|tification: This is his pre&s;ent State, without any fix'd Abode, Place, or Space allow'd him to re&s;t the Sole of his Foot upon.</P>
<P>From his Expul&s;ion, I take his fir&s;t View of Horror to be that of looking back towards the Heaven which he had lo&s;t, and there to &s;ee the Cha&s;m or Opening made up, out at which, as at a
<PB N="82" REF="90">
Breach in the Wall of the holy Place, he was thru&s;t Head-long by the Power which expel'd him; I &s;ay, to &s;ee the Breach repair'd, the Mounds built up, the Walls gari&s;on'd with millions of Angels, and arm'd with Thunders; and, above all, made terrible by that Glory from who&s;e Pre&s;ence they were expel'd, as is Poetically hinted at before.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;ight, 'tis no wonder (if there was &s;uch a Place) that they fled till the Darkne&s;s might cover them, and that they might be out of the View of &s;o hated a Sight.</P>
<P>Wherever they found it, you may be &s;ure they pitch'd their fir&s;t Camp, and began, after many a four Reflection upon what was pa&s;s'd, to con&s;ider and think a little, upon what was to come.</P>
<P>If I had as much per&s;onal Acquaintance with the <HI>Devil,</HI> as would admit it, and could depend upon the Truth of what An&s;wer he would give me, the fir&s;t Que&s;tion I would ask him, &s;hould be, what Mea&s;ures they re&s;olv'd on at their fir&s;t A&s;&s;em|bly? and the next &s;hould be, how they were em|ploy'd in all that &s;pace of Time, between their &s;o flying the Face of their almighty Conqueror, and the Creation of Man? as for the Length of the Time, which, according to the Learn'd, was twenty thou&s;and Years, and according to the more Learn|ed, not a Quarter &s;o much, I would not concern my Curio&s;ity much about it; 'tis mo&s;t certain, there was a con&s;iderable time between, but of that immediately; fir&s;t let me enquire what they were doing all that time.</P>
<P>The Devil and his Ho&s;t being thus, I &s;ay, ca&s;t out of Heaven, and not yet confin'd &s;trictly to <HI>Hell,</HI> 'tis plain they mu&s;t be <HI>&s;ome where:</HI> Satan and all his Legions did not lo&s;e their Exi&s;tence, no, nor the Exi&s;tence of <HI>Devils</HI> neither; GOD was &s;o far from annihilating him, that he &s;till pre&s;erv'd
<PB N="83" REF="91">
his Being; and this not Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> only, but GOD him&s;elf has made known to us, having left his Hi&s;tory &s;o far upon record; &s;everal expre&s;&s;ions in Scripture al&s;o make it evident, as particularly the &s;tory of <HI>Job,</HI> mentioned before; the like in our Saviour's time, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>If Hell did not immediately ingulph them, as <HI>Mil|ton</HI> &s;ugge&s;ts, 'tis certain, I &s;ay, that they fled Some|where from the anger of Heaven, from the face of the Avenger; and his ab&s;ence, and their own guilt, <HI>wonder not at it,</HI> would make Hell enough for them wherever they went.</P>
<P>Nor need we fly to the Dreams of our <HI>A&s;trono|mers,</HI> who take a great deal of pains to fill up the va&s;t Spaces of the &s;tarry Heavens with in|numerable habitable Worlds, allowing as many <HI>&s;olar Sy&s;tems</HI> as there are fix'd Stars, and that not only in the known Con&s;tellations, but even in <HI>Gal|laxie</HI> it &s;elf; who, to every &s;uch Sy&s;tem allow a cer|tain number of Planets, and to every one of tho&s;e Planets &s;o many <HI>Satellites</HI> or <HI>Moons,</HI> and all the&s;e Planets and Moons to be Worlds, &s;olid, dark, o|paque Bodies, habitable, and (as they would have us believe) inhabited by the like Animals and rational Creatures as on this Earth; &s;o that they may, at this rate, find room enough for the <HI>Devil</HI> and all his Angels, without making a Hell on purpo&s;e; nay they may, for ought I know, find a World for every <HI>Devil</HI> in all the <HI>Devil</HI>'s <HI>Ho&s;t,</HI> and &s;o every one may be a Monarch or <HI>Ma&s;ter-Devil</HI> &s;eparately in his own Sphere or World, and play the <HI>Devil</HI> there by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And even if this were &s;o, it cannot be denied but that one <HI>Devil</HI> in a place would be enough for a whole &s;y&s;temary World, and be able, if not re&s;trained, to do mi&s;chief enough there too, and even to ruin and overthrow the whole body of People contain'd in it.</P>
<P><PB N="84" REF="92">
But, I &s;ay, we need not fly to the&s;e &s;hifts, or con&s;ult the A&s;tronomers in the deci&s;ion of this point; for wherever <HI>Satan</HI> and his defeated Ho&s;t went, at their expul&s;ion from <HI>Heaven,</HI> we think we are certain, none of all the&s;e Beautiful Worlds, or be they Worlds or no, I mean the fix'd Stars, Planets, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> had then any exi&s;tence; for the Be|ginning, as the Scripture calls it, was not yet Begun.</P>
<P>But to &s;peak a little by the rules of Philo&s;ophy, that is &s;o &s;ay, &s;o as to be under&s;tood by others, even when we &s;peak of things we cannot fully under&s;tand our&s;elves: Tho' in the Beginning of Time all this glorious Creation was form'd, the Earth, the &s;tarry Heavens, and all the Furniture thereof, and there was a Time when they were not; yet we cannot &s;ay &s;o of the Void, or that namele&s;s <HI>no-where,</HI> as I call'd it before, which now appears to be a <HI>&s;ome-where,</HI> in which the&s;e glorious Bodies are plac'd. That immen&s;e Space which tho&s;e take up, and which they move in at this Time, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, before they had Being, to be plac'd there: As God him&s;elf was, and exi&s;ted before all Being, Time, or Place, &s;o the Heaven of Heavens, or the Place where the Thrones and Dominions of his Kingdom then ex|i&s;ted, inconceivable and ineffable, had an exi&s;|tence before the glorious Scraphs, the innume|rable company of Angels which attended about the Throne of God exi&s;ted; the&s;e all had a Being long before, as the Eternal Creator of them all had before them.</P>
<P>Into this void or aby&s;s of Nothing, however unmea&s;urable, infinite, and even to tho&s;e Spirits them&s;elves Inconceiveable, they certainly launch'd from the bright Precipice which they fell from, and &s;hifted as well as they could.</P>
<P><PB N="85" REF="93">
Here expanding tho&s;e Wings which Fear, and Horror at their Defeat furni&s;h'd them, as I hin|ted before, they hurried away to the utmo&s;t Di&s;tance po&s;&s;ible, from the Face of GOD their Conqueror, and then mo&s;t dreaded Enemy, for|merly their Joy and Glory.</P>
<P>Be this utmo&s;t remov'd Di&s;tance <HI>where it will,</HI> Here, certainly, <HI>Satan</HI> and all his <HI>Gang of Devils,</HI> his numberle&s;s, tho' routed Armies retired.

<P>SEVERAL things have been &s;ugge&s;ted to &s;etus a calculating the number of this frightful throng of <HI>Devils,</HI> who with Satan, the <HI>Ma&s;ter-Devil,</HI> was thus ca&s;t out of <HI>Heaven;</HI> I cannot &s;ay, I am &s;o much Ma&s;ter of political Arithme|tick as to ca&s;t up the Number of the Bea&s;t, no, nor the Number of the Bea&s;ts <HI>or Devils,</HI> who make up this Throng. St. <HI>Francis,</HI> they tell us, or &s;ome other Saint, they do not &s;ay who, ask'd the <HI>Devil</HI> once, how &s;trong he was? for St. <HI>Francis,</HI> you mu&s;t know, was very familiar with him; <HI>the Devil,</HI> it &s;eems, did not tell him, but pre&s;ently rai&s;ed a great Cloud of Du&s;t, by the help, I &s;uppo&s;e, of a Gu&s;t of Wind, and bid that Saint count it; He was, I &s;uppo&s;e, a Calculator, that would be call'd grave, who dividing <HI>Satan's</HI> Troops into three Lines, ca&s;t up the Number of the <HI>Devils</HI> of all &s;orts in each Battalia, at ten hundred times a hundred thou&s;and millions of the fir&s;t Line, fifty millions of times as many in the &s;econd Line, and three hundred thou&s;and times as many as both in the third Line.</P>
<P>The Impertinence of this account would hard|ly have given it a place here, only to hint that it has always been the Opinion, that <HI>Satan's</HI> Name may well be call'd a Noun of Multitude, and that <HI>the Devil</HI> and his <HI>Angels</HI> are certainly no in|con&s;iderable
<PB N="87" REF="95">
Number: It was a &s;mart Repartee that a <HI>Venctian</HI> Nobleman made to a Prie&s;t who rallied him upon his refu&s;ing to give &s;omething to the Church, which the Prie&s;t demanded for the delivering him from Purgatory; when the Prie&s;t asking him, <HI>if he knew what an innumerable Num|ber of</HI> Devils <HI>there were to take him?</HI> he an&s;wer'd, <HI>yes, he knew how many</HI> Devils <HI>there were in all: How many?</HI> &s;ays the Prie&s;t, his curio&s;ity, I &s;uppo&s;e, being rais'd by the novelty of the an&s;wer. <HI>Why ten millions five hundred and eleven thou&s;and, &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy five Devils and a half,</HI> &s;ays the Nobleman: <HI>A half!</HI> &s;ays the Prie&s;t, <HI>pray what kind of a Devil is that? your &s;elf,</HI> &s;ays the Noble|man, <HI>for you are half a Devil already (and will be a whole one when you come there) for you are for deluding all you deal with, and bringing us Soul and Body into your Hands, that you may be paid for letting us go again.</HI> So much for their Num|ber.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o it would come in very aptly, to con|&s;ider the &s;tate of that long interval between the Time of their Expul&s;ion from <HI>Heaven,</HI> and the Creation of the World; and what the Po&s;ture of the Devil's Affairs might be, during that Time. The horror of their Condition can only be con|ceiv'd of at a Di&s;tance, and e&s;pecially by us, who being embodied Creatures, cannot fully judge of what is, or is not a Puni&s;hment to <HI>Seraphs</HI> and <HI>Spirits;</HI> But 'tis ju&s;t to &s;uppo&s;e they &s;uffer'd all that Spirits of a Seraphic Nature were capable to &s;u&s;tain; con&s;i&s;tent with their Exi&s;tence; not|with&s;tanding which they retain'd &s;till the <HI>Helli&s;h|ne&s;s</HI> of their rebellious Principle, namely, their Hatred and Rage again&s;t God, and their Envy at the Felicity of his Creatures.</P>
<P>As to how long their time might be I &s;hall leave the Search, no lights being given me that
<PB N="88" REF="96">
are either probable or rational, and we have &s;o little room to make a Judgment of it, that we may as well believe Father <HI>M&mdash;,</HI> who &s;uppo&s;es it to be a hundred thou&s;and Years, as tho&s;e who judge it one thou&s;and Years; 'tis enough that we are &s;ure, it was before the Creation, how long be|fore is not material to <HI>the Devil</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> unle&s;s we had &s;ome Records of what happen'd to him, or was done by him in the Interval.</P>
<P>During the wandring Condition the Devil was in at that Time, we may &s;uppo&s;e, he and his whole Clan to be employ'd in exerting their Hatred and Rage at the Almighty, and at the Happine&s;s of the remaining faithful Angels, by all the ways they had power to &s;hew it.</P>
<P>From this determin'd &s;tated Enmity of <HI>Satan</HI> and his Ho&s;t again&s;t <HI>God,</HI> and at every thing that brought Glory to his Name, Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> brings in <HI>Satan,</HI> (when fir&s;t he &s;aw <HI>Adam</HI> in <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and the Felicity of his Station there) &s;welling with Rage and Envy, and taking up a dreadful Re&s;o|lution to ruin <HI>Adam</HI> and all his Po&s;terity, meer|ly to di&s;appoint his Maker of the Glory of his Creation; I &s;hall come to &s;peak of that in its Place.</P>
<P>How <HI>Satan,</HI> in his remote Situation, got In|telligence of the Place where to find <HI>Adam</HI> out, or that any &s;uch thing as a Man was created, is Matter of ju&s;t Speculation, and there might be many rational Schemes laid for it: Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> does not undertake to tell us the Particulars, nor indeed could he find room for it; perhaps, the <HI>Devil</HI> having, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> a Liberty to range over the whole Void or Aby&s;s, which we want as well a Name for, as indeed Powers to conceive of; might have di&s;covered that the Al|mighty Creator had form'd a new and glorious Work, with infinite Beauty and Variety, filling
<PB N="89" REF="97">
up the immen&s;e Wa&s;t of Space, in which he, the <HI>Devil</HI> and his <HI>Angels,</HI> had rov'd for &s;o long a time, without finding any thing to work on, or to exert their Apo&s;tate Rage in again&s;t their Maker.</P>
<P>That at length they found the infinite untrod|den Space, on a &s;udden &s;pread full with glo|rious Bodies, &s;hining in &s;elf-exi&s;ting Beauty, with a new, and to them unknown Lu&s;tre, call'd Light: They found the&s;e luminous Bodies, tho' immen&s;e in Bulk, and infinite in Number, yet fixt in their wondrous Stations, regular and exact in their Motions, confin'd in their proper Orbits, tending to their particular Centers, and enjoying every one their peculiar Sy&s;tems, within which was contain'd innumerable Planets with their Satellites or Moons, in which <HI>(again)</HI> a reciprocal Influence, Motion and Revolution con&s;pired to Form the mo&s;t admirable Uniformity of the whole.</P>
<P>Surprized, to be &s;ure, with this &s;udden and yet glorious Work of the Almighty; for the Cre|ation was enough, with its Lu&s;tre, even to &s;ur|prize <HI>the Devils;</HI> they might rea&s;onably be &s;up|po&s;ed to &s;tart out of their dark Retreat, and with a Curio&s;ity not below the Seraphic Dignity; for <HI>the&s;e are</HI> &s;ome of <HI>the things which the Angels de|&s;ire to look into,</HI> to take a flight thro' all the ama|zing Sy&s;tems of the fix'd Suns or Stars, which we &s;ee now but at a Di&s;tance, and only make A&s;tronomical Gue&s;&s;es at.</P>
<P>Here the Devil found not &s;ubject of Wonder only, but matter to &s;well his revolted Spirit with more Rage, and to revive the Malignity of his Mind again&s;t his Maker, and e&s;pecially again&s;t this new encrea&s;e of Glory, which to his infinite Regret was extended over the whole Wa&s;t, and which he look'd upon, as we &s;ay in human Af|fairs,
<PB N="90" REF="98">
as a <HI>Pays conquis,</HI> or, if you will have it in the Language of the <HI>Devil,</HI> as an inva&s;ion upon their Kingdom.</P>
<P>Here it naturally occurr'd to them, in their State of Envy and Rebellion, that tho' they could not a&s;&s;ault the impregnable Walls of Heaven, and could no more pretend to rai&s;e War in the Place of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and Peace, yet that per|haps they might find Room in this new, and however glorious, yet inferior Kingdom or Cre|ation, to work &s;ome de&s;pite to their great Crea|tor, or to affront his Maje&s;ty in the Per&s;on of &s;ome of his new Creatures; and upon this they may be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to double their Vigilance, in the &s;urvey they re&s;olv'd to take of the&s;e new Worlds, however great, numberle&s;s and won|derful.</P>
<P>What Di&s;coveries they may have made in the other and greater Worlds, than this Earth, we have not yet had an account; po&s;&s;ibly they are conver&s;ant with other Parts of God's Creation, be&s;ides this little, little Globe, which is but as a Point in compari&s;on of the Re&s;t; and with other of God's Creatures be&s;ides Man, who may, according to the Opinion of our Philo&s;ophers, in|habit tho&s;e Worlds; but as no body knows that Part but the <HI>Devil,</HI> we &s;hall not trouble our &s;elves with the Enquiry.</P>
<P>But 'tis very rea&s;onable, and indeed probable, that <HI>the Devils</HI> were more than ordinarily &s;ur|priz'd at the Nature and Rea&s;on of all this glo|rious Creation, after they had, with the utmo&s;t Curio&s;ity, view'd all the parts of it; The Glories of the &s;everal Sy&s;tems; the immen&s;e &s;paces in which the glorious Bodies that were created and made part of it, were allow'd re&s;pectively to move; the innumerable fix'd Stars, as &s;o many Suns in the Center of &s;o many di&s;tant <HI>Solar Sy&s;tems;</HI> the

That GOD had made him indeed of the low|e&s;t and cour&s;e&s;t Materials, but that he had breath'd into him the Breath of Life, and that he became a living thing call'd SOUL, being a kind of an extraordinary heavenly and divine Emanation; and con&s;equently that Man, however mean and Terre&s;trial his Body might be, was yet, Heaven-born, in his &s;pirituous Part compleatly Seraphic; and after a Space of Life here, (determin'd to be a &s;tate of probation) he &s;hould be tran&s;|lated thro' the Regions of Death into a Life purely and truly Seraphic, and which &s;hould remain &s;o for ever; being capable of knowing and enjoying God his Maker, and &s;tanding in his Pre&s;ence, as the glorified Angels do.</P>
<P N="3">3. That he had the mo&s;t &s;ublime Faculties infu|&s;ed into him; was capable not only of know|ing and contemplating God, and which was &s;till more, of enjoying him, as above; but (which the <HI>Devil</HI> now was not) capable of honouring and glorifying his Maker; who al&s;o had conde&s;cended to accept of Ho|nour from him.</P>
<P N="4">4. And which was &s;till more, that being of an Angelic Nature, tho' mix'd with, and con|&s;in'd for the pre&s;ent in a Ca&s;e of mortal Fle&s;h; he was intended to be remov'd from
<PB N="93" REF="101">
this Earth after a certain time of Life here, to inhabit that Heaven, and enjoy that very Glory and Felicity, from which Satan and his Angels had been expell'd.</P>
<P>When he found all this it pre&s;ently occur'd to him, that God had done it all as an act of Triumph over him (Satan,) and that the&s;e Crea|tures were only created to people Heaven, depo|pulated or &s;tript of its Inhabitants by their Ex|pul&s;ion, and that the&s;e were all to be made <HI>An|gels</HI> in the <HI>Devils</HI> &s;tead.</P>
<P>If this thought encreas'd his Fury and Envy, as far as <HI>Rage of Devils</HI> can be capable of being made greater; it doubtle&s;s &s;et him on work to give a Vent to that Rage and Envy, by &s;earching into the Nature and Con&s;titution of this Crea|ture, call'd <HI>Man;</HI> and to find out whether he was invulnerable, and could by no means be hurt by the Power of Hell, or deluded by his Sub|tilty; or whether he might be beguil'd and delu|ded, and &s;o, in&s;tead of being pre&s;erv'd in Holi|ne&s;s and Purity, wherein he was certainly crea|ted, be brought to fall and rebell as he <HI>(Satan)</HI> had done before him; by which, in&s;tead of be|ing tran&s;planted into a glorious State, after this Life in Heaven, as his Maker had de&s;ign'd him to be, to fill up the Angelic Choir, and &s;up|ply the Place from whence he <HI>(Satan)</HI> had fallen, he might be made to fall al&s;o like him, and in a Word, be made a <HI>Devil</HI> like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This convinces us that the <HI>Devil</HI> has not lo&s;t his natural Powers by his Fall, and our learned Commentator Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> is of the &s;ame Opinion; tho' he grants that the <HI>Devil</HI> has lo&s;t his moral Power, or his Power of doing Good, which he can never recover. <HI>Vide</HI> Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> upon <HI>Acts</HI> xix. 17. where we may particularly ob&s;erve,

when the Man po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with an evil Spirit flew upon the &s;even Sons of <HI>Scaeva</HI> the <HI>Jew,</HI> who would have Exorcis'd them in the Name of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> without the Authority of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> or without Faith in him, He flew on them and ma&s;|ter'd them, &s;o that they fled out of the Hou&s;e from the Devil conquered, naked and wounded: But of this Power of the Devil I &s;hall &s;peak by it &s;elf.</P>
<P>In a Word, and to &s;um up all the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Story from his fir&s;t Expul&s;ion, it &s;tands thus: For &s;o many Years as were between his Fall and the Cre|ation of Man, tho' we have no <HI>Memoirs</HI> of his parti|cular Affairs, we have Rea&s;on to believe he was without any Manner of Employment, but a cer|tain tormenting Endeavour to be always expre&s;|&s;ing his Rage and Enmity again&s;t Heaven; I call it tormenting, Becau&s;e ever di&s;appointed; every thought about it proving empty; every attempt towards it abortive; Leaving them only Light enough to &s;ee &s;till more and more Rea&s;on to de|&s;pair of Succe&s;s; and that this made his Condi|tion &s;till more and more a Hell than it was before.</P>
<P>After a Space of Duration in this Mi&s;ery, which we have no light given us to mea&s;ure or judge of, He at length di&s;cover'd the new Crea|tion of Man, as above, upon which he &s;oon found Matter to &s;et him&s;elf to work upon, and has been bu&s;ily employ'd ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>And now indeed there may be room to &s;ug|ge&s;t a Local <HI>Hell,</HI> and the Confinement of Souls (made corrupt and degenerate by him) to it, as a Place; tho' he him&s;elf, as is &s;till apparent by his Actings, is not yet confin'd to it; of this Hell, its Locality, Extent, Dimen&s;ions, Continu|ance and Nature, as it does not belong to Satan's Hi&s;tory, I have a good excu&s;e for &s;aying nothing,

<P>CUnning Men have fabled, and tho' it be without either Religion, Authority or phy|&s;ical Foundation, it may be we may like it ne'er the wor&s;e for that; that when God made the Stars and all the Heavenly Luminaries, the <HI>Devil,</HI> to mimick his Maker, and in&s;ult his new Creation, made Comets, in Imitation of the fix'd Stars; but that the Compo&s;ition of them being combu&s;ti|ble, when they came to wander in the Aby&s;s, rol|ling by an irregular ill-grounded Motion, they took Fire, in their Approach to &s;ome of tho&s;e great Bodies of Flame, <HI>the fix'd Stars;</HI> and being thus kindled (like a Fire-work unskilfully let off) they then took wild and excentrick, as al&s;o different Motions of their own, out of Satan's Direction, and beyond his Power to regulate ever after.</P>
<P>Let this Thought &s;tand by it &s;elf, it matters not to our purpo&s;e whether we believe any thing of it, or no; 'tis enough to our Ca&s;e, that if Satan had any &s;uch Power then, he has no &s;uch Power now, and that leads me to enquire into his more recent Limitations.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="104">
I am to &s;uppo&s;e, he and all his Accomplices being confounded at the Di&s;covery of the new Creation, and racking their Wits to find out the meaning of it, had at la&s;t <HI>(no matter how)</HI> di&s;co|ver'd the whole Sy&s;tem, and concluded, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> that the Creature, <HI>call'd Man,</HI> was to be their Succe&s;&s;or in the Heavenly Man&s;ions; upon which, I &s;ugge&s;t that the fir&s;t Motion of Hell was to de&s;troy this new Work, and, if po&s;&s;ible, to overwhelm it; But when they came to make the Attempt, they found their Chains were not long enough, and that they could not reach to the Ex|tremes of the Sy&s;tem: They had no Power either to break the Order, or &s;top the Motion, di&s;lo|cate the Parts, or confound the Situation of Things; they traver&s;ed, no doubt, the whole Work, vi&s;ited every Star, landed upon every So|lid, and &s;ail'd upon every Fluid in the whole Scheme, to &s;ee what Mi&s;chief they could do; but upon a long and full Survey, came to this Point in their Enquiry, that in &s;hort they could do nothing by Force; that they could not di&s;|place any Part, annihilate any Atom, or de&s;troy any Life in the whole Creation; but that as Omnipotence had created it, &s;o the &s;ame Omnipo|tence had arm'd it at all Points again&s;t the utmo&s;t Power of Hell, had made the &s;malle&s;t Creature in it invulnerable, as to <HI>Satan;</HI> &s;o that without the Permi&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame Power which had made <HI>Heaven,</HI> and conquer'd the <HI>Devil,</HI> he could do nothing at all, as to de&s;troying any thing that God had made, no, not the little diminutive thing call'd Man, who <HI>Satan</HI> &s;aw &s;o much rea|&s;on to hate, as being created to &s;ucceed him in Happine&s;s in <HI>Heaven;</HI> Satan found him placed out of his Power to hurt, or out of his Reach to touch; and here, by the way, appears the &s;econd Conque&s;t of <HI>Heaven</HI> over the <HI>Devil;</HI> that having

plac'd his Rival, as it were, ju&s;t before his Face, and &s;hew'd the hateful &s;ight to him, he &s;aw writ|ten upon his Image, <HI>Touch him if you dare.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be doubted, but, had it not been thus, Man is &s;o far from being a Match for the <HI>Devil,</HI> that one of Satan's lea&s;t Imps or <HI>Angels</HI> could de&s;troy all the Race of them in the World, ay World and all in a moment; as he is Prince of the Power of the Air, taking the Air there for <HI>the Elemen|tary World;</HI> how ea&s;ily could he, at one Bla&s;t, &s;weep all the Surface of the Earth into the Sea, or drive the weighty immen&s;e Surges of the Oce|an over the whole Plane of the Earth, and deluge the Globe at once with a Storm? Or how ea&s;ily could he, who, by the Situation of his Empire, mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed able to manage the Clouds, draw them up, in &s;uch Po&s;ition as &s;hould naturally pro|duce Thunders and Lightnings, cau&s;e tho&s;e Light|nings to bla&s;t the Earth, da&s;h in Pieces all the fine Buildings, burn all the populous Towns and Cities, and lay wa&s;t the World; at the &s;ame time command &s;uited Quantities of &s;ublimated Air to bur&s;t out of the Bowels of the Earth, and overwhelm and &s;wal|low up, in the opening Cha&s;mas, all the Inhabi|tants of the Globe? In a Word, <HI>Satan</HI> left to him&s;elf as a Devil, and to the Power, which by virtue of his Seraphic Original he mu&s;t be ve&s;t|ed with, was able to have made Devili&s;h Work in the World, if by a &s;uperior Power he was not re&s;train'd.</P>
<P>But there is no doubt, <HI>at lea&s;t to me,</HI> but that with his Fall from Heaven, as he lo&s;t the Recti|tude and Glory of his Angelic Nature, I mean his Innocence, &s;o he lo&s;t the Power too that he had before; and that when he fir&s;t commenc'd Devil, he receiv'd the Chains of Re&s;traint too, as the Badge of his Apo&s;tacy, <HI>viz.</HI> a general Pro|hibition, to do any thing to the Prejudice of
<PB N="98" REF="106">
this Creation, or to act any thing by Force or Violence without &s;pecial Permi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This Prohibition was not &s;ent him by a Me&s;|&s;enger, or by an Order in Writing, or proclaimed from Heaven by a Law; but <HI>Satan,</HI> by a &s;trange, invi&s;ible and unaccountable Impre&s;&s;ion felt the Re&s;traint within him; and at the &s;ame time that his moral Capacity was not taken away, yet his Power of exerting that Capacity felt the Re|&s;traint, and left him unable to do, even what he was able to do at the &s;ame time.</P>
<P>I make no que&s;tion, but the Devil is &s;en&s;ible of this Re&s;traint, that is to &s;ay, <HI>not</HI> as it is a Re&s;traint only, or as an effect of his Expul&s;ion from <HI>Hea|ven;</HI> But as it prevents his Capital De&s;ign again&s;t Man, who, for the Rea&s;on I have given already, he entertains a mortal Hatred of, and would de|&s;troy with all his Heart, if he might; and there|fore, like a chain'd Ma&s;tiff, we find him often|times making a horrid helli&s;h Clamour and Noi&s;e, barking and howling, and frighting the People, letting them know, that if he was loo&s;e he would tear them to pieces; but at the &s;ame time his very Fury &s;hakes his Chain, which lets them know, to their Satisfaction, he can only Bark, but can|not Bite.</P>
<P>Some are of Opinion that the Devil is not re|&s;train'd &s;o much by the &s;uperior Power of his So|vereign and Maker; but that all his milder Mea|&s;ures with Man are the effect of a political Scheme, and done upon mature Deliberation; that it was re&s;olved to act thus, in the great Council or P&mdash;t of Devils, call'd upon this very Occa&s;ion, when they fir&s;t were inform'd of the Creation of Man; and e&s;pecially when they con&s;idered what kind of Creature he was, and what might probably be the Rea&s;on of making him, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to fill up the Vacancies in Heaven; I &s;ay, that then the
<PB N="99" REF="107">
<HI>Devils</HI> re&s;olv'd, that it was not for their Inte|re&s;t to fall upon him with Fury and Rage, and &s;o de&s;troy the Species, for that this would be no Benefit at all to them, and would only cau&s;e ano|ther original Man to be created; for that they knew GOD could, by the &s;ame Omnipotence, form as many new Species of Creatures as he plea&s;ed; and, if he thought fit, create them in Heaven too, out of the Reach of <HI>Devils</HI> or evil Spirits, and that therefore, to de&s;troy Man would no way an&s;wer their End.</P>
<P>On the other hand, examining &s;trictly the Mould of this new Creature, and of what Ma|terials he was form'd; how mixt up of a Nature convertible and pervertible, capable indeed of infinite Excellence, and con&s;equently of eternal Felicity; but &s;ubject likewi&s;e to Corruption and Degeneracy, and con&s;equently to eternal Mi&s;ery; That in&s;tead of being fit to &s;upply the Places of Satan and his rejected Tribe (the expell'd Angels) in Heaven, and filling up the Thrones or Stalls in the Cele&s;tial Choir, they might, if they could but be brought into Crime, become a Race of Re|bels and Traytors like the re&s;t, and &s;o come at la&s;t to keep them Company, as well in the Place of eternal Mi&s;ery, as in the Merit of it, and in a Word, become Devils in&s;tead of Angels.</P>
<P>Upon this Di&s;covery, I &s;ay, they found it infi|nitely more for the Intere&s;t of Satan's infernal Kingdom, to go another way to work with Man|kind, and &s;ee if it were po&s;&s;ible, by the &s;trength of all their infernal Wit and Councils, to lay &s;ome Snare for him, and by &s;ome Stratagem to bring him to eternal Ruin and Mi&s;ery.</P>
<P>This being then approv'd as their only Method, (and the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hew'd he was no Fool in the Choice) he next re&s;olved that there was no time to be lo&s;t; that it was to be &s;et about immediately, before the
<PB N="100" REF="108">
Race was Multiplied, and before, by that means the Work be not made greater only, but perhaps the more difficult too; accordingly the diligent Devil went in&s;tantly about it, agreeable to all the Story of <HI>Eve</HI> and the Serpent, as before; the be|lief of which, whether hi&s;torically or allegorically, is not at all ob&s;tructed by this Hypothe&s;is.</P>
<P>I do not affirm that this was the Ca&s;e at fir&s;t, becau&s;e being not pre&s;ent in that black <HI>Divan,</HI> at lea&s;t not that I know of, <HI>for who knows where he was or was not in his pre-exi&s;tent State?</HI> I can|not be po&s;itive in the Re&s;olve that pa&s;t there; but except for &s;ome very little Contradiction, which we find in the Sacred Writings, I &s;hould, I confe&s;s, incline to believe it Hi&s;torically; and I &s;hall &s;peak of tho&s;e things which I call Contra|dictions to it more largely hereafter.</P>
<P>In the mean time, be it one way or other, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> either that Satan had no Power to have proceeded with Man by Violence, and to have de|&s;troy'd him as &s;oon as he was made; or that he had the Power, but cho&s;e rather to proceed by other Methods to deceive and debauch him; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> be it which you plea&s;e, I am &s;till of the Opi|nion that it really was not the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s to de&s;troy the Species; that it would have been nothing to the purpo&s;e, and no Advantage at all to him, if he had done it; for that, as above, GOD could immediately have created another Species to the &s;ame end, whom he either could have made invulnerable, and not &s;ubject to the Devil's Power, or remov'd him out of <HI>Satan</HI>'s Reach, plac'd him out of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Ken, in Heaven or &s;ome other Place, where the Devil could not come to hurt him; and that therefore it is infi|nitely more his Advantage, and more &s;uited to his real De&s;ign of defeating the End of Man's Cre|ation, to debauch him and make a <HI>Devil</HI> of him,
<PB N="101" REF="109">
that he may be rejected like him&s;elf, and increa&s;e the infernal Kingdom and Company in the Lake of Mi&s;ery <HI>in aeternum.</HI></P>
<P>It may be true, for ought I know, that Satan has not the Power of De&s;truction put into his Hand, and that he cannot take away the Life of a Man; and it &s;eems probable to be &s;o, from the Story of <HI>Satan</HI> and <HI>Job,</HI> when <HI>Satan</HI> appear'd among the Sons of GOD, as the Text &s;ays, <HI>Job</HI> i. 6. Now when God gave &s;uch a Character of <HI>Job</HI> to him, and ask'd him <HI>if he had con&s;ider'd his Servant Job,</HI> #. 8. why did not the Devil go immedi|diately and exert his Malice again&s;t the good Man at once, to let his Maker &s;ee what would become of his Servant <HI>Job</HI> in his Di&s;tre&s;s? On the contrary, we &s;ee he only an&s;wers by &s;hewing the Rea&s;on of <HI>Job</HI>'s good Behaviour; that it was but common Gratitude for the Ble&s;&s;ing and Protection he enjoy'd, #. 10. and pleading that if his E&s;tate was taken away, and he was expos'd as he (Satan) was, to be a Beggar and a Vagabond, going <HI>to and fro in the Earth, and walking up and down therein,</HI> he would be a very Devil too, like him&s;elf, and cur&s;e God to his Face.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Text &s;ays, that God an&s;wer'd #. 11. <HI>Behold all that he hath is in thy Power;</HI> now 'tis plain here, that God gave up <HI>Job</HI>'s Wealth and E&s;tate, nay his Family, and the Lives of his Chil|dren and Servants into the Devil's Power; and accordingly, like a true mercile&s;s Devil, <HI>as he is,</HI> he de&s;troy'd them all; he mov'd the <HI>Sabeans</HI> to fall upon the Oxen and the A&s;&s;es, and carry them off; he mov'd the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> to fall upon the Cmels and the Servants, to carry off the fir&s;t, and murhter the la&s;t; he made Lightning fla&s;h upon the poor Sheep, and kill them all; and he blow'd the Hou&s;e down upon his poor Children, and buried them all in the Ruins.</P>

Now here is (1.) a Specimen of Satan's good Will to Mankind, and what Havock the <HI>Devil</HI> would make in the World, if he might; and here is a Te&s;timony too, that he could not do this without leave; &s;o that I cannot but be of the Opi|nion he has &s;ome Limitations, &s;ome Bounds &s;et to his natural Fury; a certain Number of Links in his Chain, which he cannot exceed, or, in a Word, that he cannot go a Foot beyond his <HI>Tether.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame kind of Evidence we have in the Go&s;pel, <HI>Math.</HI> viii. 31. where Satan could not &s;o much as po&s;&s;e&s;s the filthie&s;t and meane&s;t of all Creatures, <HI>the Swine,</HI> till he had ask'd leave; and that &s;till, to &s;hew his good Will, as &s;oon as he had gotten leave, he hurried them all into the Sea and choak'd them; the&s;e, I &s;ay, are &s;ome of the Rea&s;ons why I am not willing to &s;ay, the <HI>Devil</HI> is not re&s;train'd in Power; but on the other &s;ide, we are told of &s;o many mi&s;chievous things the Devil has done in the World, by virtue of his Domini|on over the Elements, and by other Te&s;timonies of his Power, that I don't know what to think of it; tho', upon the whole, the fir&s;t is the &s;afe&s;t Opinion; for if we believe the la&s;t, we may, for ought I know, be brought, like the <HI>American In|dians,</HI> to wor&s;hip him that he may do us no Harm.</P>
<P>And now I have nam'd tho&s;e People in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> I confe&s;s it would go a great way in favour of Satan's Genero&s;ity, as well as in Te&s;timony of his Power, if we might believe all the Accounts, which indeed Authors are pretty well agreed in the Truth of, namely, of the Mi&s;chiefs the <HI>Devil</HI> does in tho&s;e Countries, where his Dominion &s;eems to be e&s;tabli&s;h'd; how he u&s;es them when they deny him that Homage he claims of them as his Due; what Havock and Combu&s;tion he makes

<P>Likewi&s;e we &s;ee a Te&s;t of his wicked Subtilty in his Management of tho&s;e dark Nations, when he was more immediately wor&s;hip'd by them; namely, the making them believe that all their good Weather, Rains, Dews, and kind Influences upon the Earth, to make it fruitful, was from Him; whereas they really were the common Ble&s;&s;ings of a higher Hand, and came not from him, the <HI>Devil,</HI> but from him that made the <HI>Devil,</HI> and made him a Devil or fallen Angel by his Cur&s;e.</P>
<P>But to go back to the Method the Devil took with the fir&s;t of Mankind; 'tis plain the Policy of Hell was right, tho' the Execution of the Re|&s;olves they took did not fully an&s;wer their End neither; For <HI>Satan</HI> fa&s;tening upon poor, proud, ri|diculous Mother <HI>Eve,</HI> as I have &s;aid before, made pre&s;ently a true Judgment of her Capacities, and of her Temper; took her by the right Handle, and &s;oothing her Vanity (which is to this Day the &s;ofte&s;t Place in the Head of all the Sex) wheedl'd her out of her Sen&s;es, by prai&s;ing her Beauty, and promi&s;ing to make her a Godde&s;s.</P>
<P>The fooli&s;h Woman yielded pre&s;ently, and that we are told is the Rea&s;on why the &s;ame Method &s;o &s;trangely takes with all her Po&s;terity <HI>(viz.)</HI> that you are &s;ure to prevail with them, if you can but once per&s;uade them that you believe they are Witty and Hand&s;ome; for the Devil, you may ob&s;erve, never quits any Hold he gets, and having once found a way into the Heart, always takes care to keep the Door open, that any of his Agents may en|ter after him without any more Difficulty: Hence the &s;ame Argument, e&s;pecially the la&s;t, has &s;o be|witching an Influence on the Sex, that they never deny you any thing, after they are but weak
<PB N="104" REF="112">
enough and vain enough to accept of the Prai&s;es you offer them on that Head; on the other Hand you are &s;ure they never forgive you the unpardonable Crime of &s;aying they are Ugly or Di&s;agreeable: It is &s;ugge&s;ted that the fir&s;t Method the Devil took to in&s;inuate all tho&s;e fine things into <HI>Eve</HI>'s giddy Head, was by creeping clo&s;e to her <HI>one Night,</HI> when &s;he was a&s;leep, and laying his Mouth to her <HI>Ear,</HI> Whi&s;pering all the fine things to her, which he knew would &s;et her Fancy a Tip-toe, and &s;o made her receive them involuntarily into her Mind, knowing well enough that when &s;he had form'd &s;uch Ideas in her Soul, however they came there, &s;he would never be quiet till &s;he had work'd them up to &s;ome extraordinary thing or other.</P>
<P>It was evident what the <HI>Devil</HI> aim'd at, <HI>namely,</HI> that &s;he &s;hould break in upon the Command of GOD, and &s;o having corrupted her &s;elf, bring the Cur&s;e upon her &s;elf and all her Race, as GOD had threatn'd; but why the Pride of <HI>Eve</HI> &s;hould be &s;o ea&s;ily tickled by the Motion of her exqui&s;ite Beauty, when there then was no pro&s;pect of the u&s;e or want of tho&s;e Charms? that indeed makes a kind of Difficulty here, which the learn'd have not determined. for,</P>

cunning to do any thing that &s;ignifies No|thing, rather tempted her by the Hope of encrea&s;ing her Wit, than her Beauty.</P>
<P>But to come back to the Method of Satan's tempting her, <HI>viz.</HI> by Whi&s;pering to her &s;leep; 'twas a cunning Trick, that's the Truth of it, and by that means he certainly &s;et her Head a madding after <HI>Dei&s;m,</HI> and to be made a Godde&s;s, and then back'd it by the &s;ubtle talk he had with her afterward.</P>
<P>I am the more particular upon this Part, be|cau&s;e, however the Devil may have been the fir&s;t that ever practi&s;ed it, yet I can a&s;&s;ure him the Experiment has been tried upon many a Woman &s;ince, to the wheedling her out of her Mode&s;ty, as well as her Simplicity; and the Cunning Men tell us &s;till, that if you can come at a Woman when &s;he is in a deep &s;leep, and Whi&s;per to her clo&s;e to her Ear, &s;he will certainly Dream of the Thing you &s;ay to her, and &s;o will a Man too.</P>
<P>Well, be this &s;o to her Race or not, it was it &s;eems &s;o to her; for &s;he wak'd with her Head fill'd with plea&s;ing Ideas, and as &s;ome will have it, un|lawful De&s;ires; &s;uch, as to be &s;ure &s;he never had entertain'd before, fatally infu&s;ed in her Dream, and &s;ugge&s;ted to her waking Soul, when the Or|gan Ear which convey'd them was doz'd and in|&s;en&s;ible; &s;trange Fate of &s;leeping in <HI>Paradi&s;e!</HI> that we &s;eem to have Notice but of two Sleeps there, and that in one a <HI>Woman</HI> &s;hould go out of him, and in the other, the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould come into her.</P>
<P>Certainly, when Satan fir&s;t made the Attempt upon <HI>Eve,</HI> he did not think he &s;hould have &s;o ea&s;ily conquered her, or have brought his Bu&s;ine&s;s about &s;o &s;oon; the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf could not have imagined &s;he &s;hould have been &s;o &s;oon brought

to forget the Command given, or at lea&s;t who gave it, and have ventur'd to tran&s;gre&s;s again&s;t him, and made her forget that GOD had told her, it &s;hould be Death to her to touch it; and above all, that &s;he &s;hould a&s;pire to be as wi&s;e as him, who was &s;o ignorant before, as to believe it was for fear of her being like him&s;elf, that he had forbid it her.</P>
<P>Well might &s;he be &s;aid to be the weaker Ve&s;|&s;el, tho' <HI>Adam</HI> him&s;elf had little enough to &s;ay for his being the &s;tronger of the two, when he was over-per&s;uaded (if it were done by Per&s;ua&s;ion) by his Wife to do the &s;ame thing.</P>
<P>And mark how wi&s;e they were after they had Eaten, and what Fools they both acted like, even to one another; nay, even all the Knowledge they attain'd to by it was, for ought I &s;ee, only to know that they were Fools to be &s;en&s;ible of <HI>Sin</HI> and <HI>Shame;</HI> and &s;ee how &s;imply they acted, I &s;ay, upon their having committed the Crime, and be|ing detected in it.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;View them to Day conver&s;ing with their God, His Image both enjoy'd and under&s;tood, <HI>To Morrow</HI> skulking with a &s;ordid Flight, Among the Bu&s;hes from the <HI>Infinite, (Sight;</HI> As if that Power <HI>was blind</HI> which gave them With &s;en&s;ele&s;s Labour Tagging Fig-Leaf-Ve&s;ts,&endq; To hide their Bodies from the &s;ight of Bea&s;ts.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Hark! how the Fool pleads faint, for forfeit Life, Fir&s;t he reproaches Heaven, and then his Wife: The Woman which thou gav'&s;t, as if the Gift Could rob him of the little Rea&s;on left, A weak Pretence to &s;hift his early Crime, As if accu&s;ing her would excu&s;e him;

But thus encroaching Crime dethrones the Sen&s;e, And intercepts the Heavenly Influence, Debauches Rea&s;on, makes the Man a Fool,&endq; And turns his active Light to Ridicule.</Q></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd that it was unaccountable De|generacy, even of their common Rea&s;oning, which <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> both fell into upon the fir&s;t com|mitting the Offence of taking the forbidden Fruit: If That was their being made as Gods, it made but a poor Appearance in its fir&s;t coming, to hide their Nakedne&s;s when there was no body to &s;ee them, and cover them&s;elves among the Bu&s;hes from their Maker; but thus it was, and this the Devil had brought them to, and well might he, and all the Clan of Hell, as Mr. <HI>Mil|ton</HI> brings them in, laugh and triumph over the Man after the Blow was given, as having &s;o egre|giou&s;ly abu&s;ed and deluded them both.</P>
<P>But here, to be &s;ure, began the <HI>Devil</HI>'s new Kingdom; as he had now &s;educ'd the two fir&s;t Creatures, he was pretty &s;ure of Succe&s;s upon all the Race, and therefore prepar'd to attack them al&s;o, as &s;oon as they came on; nor was their en|crea&s;ing Multitude any Di&s;couragement to his At|tempt, but ju&s;t the contrary; for he had Agents enough to employ, if every Man and Woman that &s;hould be born was to want a <HI>Devil</HI> to wait upon them, &s;eparately and &s;ingly to &s;educe them; whereas &s;ome whole Nations have been &s;uch willing &s;ubjects to him, that one of his Seraphic Imps may, <HI>for ought we know,</HI> have been enough to guide a whole Country; the People being en|tirely &s;ubjected to his Government for many Ages; as in <HI>America, for example&punc;</HI> $Word$ &s;ome will have it, that he convey'd the $Span$, at lea&s;t

if he did not, we don't well know who did, or how they got thither.</P>
<P>And how came all the Communication to be &s;o entirely cut off between the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> from whence <HI>America</HI> mu&s;t certainly have been peopl'd, or el&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> mu&s;t have done it indeed? I &s;ay, how came the Communication to be &s;o entirely cut off between them, that except the time, <HI>whenever it was,</HI> that People did at fir&s;t reach from one to the other, none ever came back to give their Friends any account of their Succe&s;s, or invite them to follow? Nor did they hear of one another afterwards, as we have Rea&s;on to think: Did <HI>Satan</HI> politically keep them thus a&s;un|der, le&s;t News from Heaven &s;hould reach them, and &s;o they &s;hould be recover'd out of his Govern|ment? We cannot tell how to give any other rational Account of it, that a Nation, nay a Quarter of the World, or as &s;ome will have it be, half the Globe, &s;hould be peopled from <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>Africa,</HI> or both, and no body ever go after them, or come back from them in above three thou&s;and years after.</P>
<P>Nay, that tho&s;e Countries &s;hould be peopled when there was no Navigation in u&s;e in the&s;e Parts of the World, no Ships made that could carry Provi&s;ions enough to &s;upport the Peo|ple that &s;ail'd in them, but that they mu&s;t have been &s;tarved to death before they could reach the Shore of <HI>America;</HI> the Ferry from <HI>Europe</HI> or <HI>Africa,</HI> in any Part (which we have known Navi|gation to be practi&s;ed in) being at lea&s;t 1000 Miles, and in mo&s;t Places much more.</P>
<P>But as to the <HI>Americans,</HI> let the <HI>Devil</HI> and they alone to account for their coming Thither, this we are certain of, that we knew nothing of them for many hundred Years; and when we did, when the Di&s;covery was made, they that went from Hence &s;ound <HI>Satan</HI> in a full and quiet Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them,

ruling them with an arbitrary Government, parti|cular to him&s;elf; He had led them into a blind Sub|jection to him&s;elf, nay, I might call it Devotion, (for it was all of Religion that was to be found among them) wor&s;hiping horrible Idols in his Name, to whom he directed human Sacrifices continually to be made, till he deluged the Country with Blood, and ripen'd them up for the De&s;truction that fol|low'd, from the Inva&s;ion of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> who he knew would hurry them all out of the World as fa&s;t as he <HI>(the Devil)</HI> him&s;elf could de&s;ire of them.</P>
<P>But to go back a little to the Original of Things, It is evident that <HI>Satan</HI> has made a much better Market of Mankind, by thus &s;ubtilly attacking them, and bringing them to break with their Maker as he had done before them, Than he could have done by fulminating upon them at fir&s;t, and &s;ending them all out of the World at once; for now he has peopled his own Dominions with them, and tho' a Remnant are &s;natch'd as it were out of his Clutches, by the Agency of Invinci|ble Grace, of which I am not to di&s;cour&s;e in this Place; yet this may be &s;aid of the <HI>Devil,</HI> with|out Offence, that he has in &s;ome Sen&s;e carried his Point, and as it were forc'd his Maker to be &s;a|tisfied with a Part of Mankind, and the lea&s;t Part too, in&s;tead of the great Glory he would have brought to him&s;elf by keeping them all in his Service.</P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Milton,</HI> as I have noted above, brings in the <HI>Devil</HI> and all Hell with him, making a <HI>Feu de Joye</HI> for the Victory <HI>Satan</HI> obtain'd over one &s;illy Woman; indeed it was a Piece of Succe&s;s greater in its Con&s;equence than in the immediate Appearance; nor was the Conque&s;t &s;o compleat as Satan him&s;elf imagin'd to make, &s;ince the Pro|mi&s;e of a Redemption out of his Hands, which was immediately made to the Man, in behalf of

him&s;elf and his believing Po&s;terity, was a great Di&s;appointment to Satan, and as it were &s;natch'd the beil Part of his Victory out of his Hands.</P>
<P>It is certain the <HI>Devils</HI> knew what the mean|ing of that Promi&s;e was, and who was to be the <HI>Seed of the Woman,</HI> namely, the incarnate <HI>Son of God,</HI> and that it was a &s;econd Blow to the whole infernal Body; but as if they had re&s;olved to let that alone, <HI>Satan</HI> went on with his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s; and as he had introduc'd Crime into the common Parent of Mankind, and thereby &s;ecu|red the Contamination of Blood, and the De|&s;cent or Propagation of the corrupt Seed, he had nothing to do but to a&s;&s;i&s;t Nature in time to come, to carry on its own Rebellion, and act it &s;elf in the Brea&s;ts of <HI>Eve</HI>'s tainted Po&s;terity; and that in|deed has been the Devil's Bu&s;ine&s;s ever &s;ince his fir&s;t Victory upon the Kind, to this Day.</P>
<P>His Succe&s;s in this Part has been &s;uch, that we &s;ee upon innumerable Occa&s;ions a general De|fection has follow'd; a kind of a Taint upon Na|ture, <HI>call it what you will,</HI> a Bla&s;t upon the Race of Mankind; and were it not for one thing he had ruin|ed the whole Family; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> were it not for one thing, namely, a &s;elected Company or Number, who his Maker has re&s;olv'd he &s;hall not be able to corrupt, or if he does, the &s;ending the promis'd Seed &s;hall recover back again from him, by the Power of irre&s;i&s;tible Grace; which Number thus &s;elected or elected, call it which we will, are &s;till to &s;upply the Vacancies in Heaven, which <HI>Satan</HI>'s Defection left open; and what was before fill'd up with crea|ted Seraphs, is now to be re&s;tor'd by recover'd Saints, by whom infinite Glory is to accrue to the Kingdom of the Redeemer.</P>
<P>This glorious E&s;tabli&s;hment has robb'd Satan of all the Joy of his Victory, and left him ju&s;t where he was, defeated and di&s;appointed; nor

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Of the Progre&s;s of Satan in carrying on his Conque&s;t over Mankind, from the Fall of</HI> Eve <HI>to the Deluge.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Doubt if the Devil was ask'd the Que&s;tion plainly, he would confe&s;s, that after he had con|quer'd <HI>Eve</HI> by his own wicked Contrivance, and then by her A&s;&s;i&s;tance had brought <HI>Adam</HI> too, like a Fool as he was, into the &s;ame Gulph of Mi&s;ery, he thought he had done his Work, compa&s;&s;ed the whole Race, that they were now his own, and that he had put an End to the grand De&s;ign of their Creation; namely, of Peopling Heaven with a new Angelic Race of Souls, who when glori|fy'd, &s;hould make up the Defection of the Ho&s;t of Hell, that had been expung'd by their Crime; And that, in a Word, he had gotten a better Con|que&s;t than if he had de&s;troy'd them all.</P>
<P>But that in the mid&s;t of his Conque&s;t, he found a Check put to the Advantages he expected to reap from his Victory, by the immediate Promi&s;e of Grace to a Part of the Po&s;terity of <HI>Adam,</HI> who, notwith&s;tanding the Fall, were to be purcha|&s;ed by the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> and &s;natch'd out of his <HI>(Satan</HI>'s)
<PB N="112" REF="120">
Hands, and over whom he could make no final Conque&s;t; &s;o that his Power met with a new Limitation, and that &s;uch, as indeed fully di&s;ap|pointed him in the main thing he aim'd at, <HI>(viz.)</HI> preventing the Beatitudes of Mankind, which were thus &s;ecur'd; (And what if the Numbers of Mankind were upon this account encrea&s;ed in &s;uch a manner, that the &s;elected Number &s;hould, by Length of Time, amount to ju&s;t as many as the whole Race, had they not fallen, would have amounted to in all?) And thus, indeed, the World may be &s;aid to be upheld and continued for the Sake of tho&s;e few, &s;ince till their Number can be compleated, the Creation cannot fall, any more than, that without them, or but for them it would not have &s;tood.</P>
<P>But leaving this Speculation, and not having enquir'd of Satan what he has to &s;ay on that Sub|ject, let us go back to the Antediluvian World; The <HI>Devil,</HI> to be &s;ure, gain'd his Point upon <HI>Eve,</HI> and in her upon all her Race: He drew her in|to Sin; got her turn'd out of <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> and the Man with her: The next Thing was to go to work with her Po&s;terity, and particularly with her two Sons <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Adam</HI> having, notwith&s;tanding his Fall, repent|ed very &s;incerely of his Sin; receiv'd the Promi&s;e of Redemption and Pardon, with an humble but believing Heart, Charity bids us &s;uppo&s;e that he led a very religious and &s;ober Life ever after; and e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t Part of his Time; That he brought up his Children very &s;oberly, and gave them all the nece&s;&s;ary Advantages of a Religious Education, and a good Introduction into the World, that he was capable of, and that <HI>Eve</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted to both in her Place and Degree.</P>
<P>Their two elde&s;t Sons <HI>Cain</HI> and <HI>Abel;</HI> The one Heir apparent to the Patriarchal Empire, and the
<PB N="113" REF="121">
other Heir pre&s;umptive, I &s;uppo&s;e al&s;o, lived very &s;ober and religious Lives; and as the Principles of natural Religion dictated a Homage and Sub|jection due to the Almighty Maker, as an Acknow|ledgment of his Mercies, and a Recognition of their Obedience; &s;o the receiv'd U&s;age of Religi|on dictating at that Time that this Homage was to be paid by a Sacrifice, they either of them brought a Free-will-offering to be dedicated to God re|&s;pectively for them&s;elves and Families.</P>
<P>How it was, and for what Rea&s;on that God had re&s;pect to the Offering of <HI>Abel,</HI> which the Learn'd &s;ay, was <HI>a Lamb</HI> of the Fir&s;tlings of the Flo$k, and did not give any Te&s;timony of the like Re&s;pect to <HI>Cain</HI> and his Offering, which was of the fir&s;t Fruits of the Earth, the Offerings being equal|ly &s;uited to the re&s;pective Employment of the him, that is not my pre&s;ent Lu&s;ine&s;s; but this we find made Heart-burnings, and rai&s;ed Envy and Jealou&s;y in the Mind of <HI>Cain;</HI> and at that Doo$ the <HI>Devil</HI> immediately entred; for he, from the Beginning, was very diligent in his way, never &s;lip'd any Opportunity, or mi&s;s'd any Ad|vantages that the Circum&s;tances of Mankind of|fered him to do Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>What Shape or Appearance the Devil took up to enter into a Conver&s;ation with <HI>Cain</HI> upon the Subject, that Authors do not take upon them to determine; but 'tis generally &s;uppo&s;ed he per&s;o|nated &s;ome of <HI>Cain</HI>'s Sons or Grand&s;ons to begin the Di&s;cour&s;e, who attack'd their Father, or per|haps Grandfather, upon this Occa&s;ion, in the fol|lowing Manner, or to that Purpo&s;e.</P>

<SPEAKER>Cain.</SPEAKER>
<P>And &s;o I will; <HI>Abel</HI> &s;hall quickly know what 'tis to trample on his elder Brother; &s;hall know that he's thus &s;entenc'd by his Father, and I'm commi&s;&s;ion'd but to execute his high Com|mand, his Sentence, which is God's, and that he falls by the Hand of Heavenly Ju&s;tice.</P>
</SP>
<P>So now Satan had done his Work, he had de|luded the Mother to a Breach again&s;t the fir&s;t and only Command, he had drawn <HI>Adam</HI> to the &s;ame Snare, and now he brings in <HI>Cain</HI> prompted by his own Rage, and deluded by his, (Satan's,) Craft to commit Murder, nay a Fratricide, an ag|gravated Murther.</P>
<P>Upon this he &s;ends out <HI>Cain,</HI> while the bloody Rage was in its Ferment, and wickedly at the &s;ame Time bringing <HI>Abel,</HI> innocent and fearing no ill, ju&s;t in his Way, he &s;ugge&s;ts to his Thoughts &s;uch Words as the&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="122" REF="130">
Look you <HI>Cain,</HI> &s;ee how Divine Ju&s;tice con|curs with your Father's righteous Sentence, &s;ee there's thy Brother <HI>Abel</HI> directed by Heaven to fall into thy Hands unarm'd, unguarded, that thou may'&s;t do thy &s;elf Ju&s;tice upon him without Fear; &s;ee thou may'&s;t kill him, and if thou ha&s;t a Mind to conceal it, no Eyes can &s;ee, or will the World ever know it, &s;o that no Re&s;entment or Revenge upon thee, or thy Po&s;terity, can be apprehended, but it may be &s;aid &s;ome wild Bea&s;t had rent him; nor will any one &s;ugge&s;t that thou, his Brother and Superior, could po&s;&s;ibly be the Per&s;on.</P>
<P><HI>Cain</HI> prepar'd for the Fact, by his former a|vow'd Rage and Re&s;olution of Revenge, was &s;o much the le&s;s prepar'd to avoid the Snare thus artfully contriv'd by the Ma&s;ter of all Sub|tilty, the <HI>Devil;</HI> &s;o he immediately runs upon his Brother <HI>Abel,</HI> and after a little unarm'd Re&s;i&s;tance, the innocent poor Man expecting no &s;uch Mi&s;|chief, was conquer'd and murther'd; after which as is to be &s;uppo&s;ed, the exa&s;perated Crew of <HI>Cain</HI>'s outrageous Race, over-run all his Family and Hou&s;hold, killing Man, Woman and Child.</P>
<P>It is objected here that we have no Authority in Scripture to prove this Part of the Story; but I an&s;wer, 'tis not likely but that <HI>Abel,</HI> as well as <HI>Cain,</HI> being at Man's E&s;tate long before this, had &s;everal Children by their own Si&s;ters, for they were the only Men in the World who were al|low'd the Marrying their own Si&s;ters, there be|ing no other Women then in the World; and as we never read of any of <HI>Abel</HI>'s Po&s;terity, 'tis likewi&s;e as probable they were all murthe'd, as that they &s;hould kill <HI>Abel</HI> only, who&s;e Sons might immediately fall upon <HI>Cain</HI> for the Blood of their Father, and &s;o the World have been involv'd in a Civil War as &s;oon as there were two Families in it.</P>
<P><PB N="123" REF="131">
But be it &s;o or not, 'tis not doubted the Devil wrought with <HI>Cain</HI> in the horrid Murther, or he had never done it; whether it was directly or by Agents is not material, nor is the Latter unlike|ly; and if the Latter, then there is no Improba|bility in the Story, for why might not he that made U&s;e of the Serpent to tempt <HI>Eve,</HI> be as well &s;uppo|&s;ed to make a Tool of &s;ome of <HI>Cain</HI>'s Sons or Grand&s;ons to prompt him in the wicked Attempt of murthering his Brother? and why mu&s;t we be oblig'd to bring in a Miracle or an Apparition into the Story, to make it probable that the <HI>Devil</HI> had any Hand in it, when 'twas &s;o natural to a degenerate Race to act in &s;uch a Manner?</P>
<P>However it was, and by whatever Tool the <HI>Devil</HI> wrought, 'tis certain that this was the Con&s;e|quence, poor <HI>Abel</HI> was butcher'd, and thus the <HI>Devil</HI> made a &s;econd Conque&s;t in God's Creation; for <HI>Adam</HI> was now, as may be &s;aid, really Childle&s;s, for his two Sons were thus far lo&s;t, <HI>Abel</HI> was kill|ed, and <HI>Cain</HI> was cur&s;t and driven out from the Pre|&s;ence of the Lord, and his Race bla&s;ted with him.</P>
<P>It would be a u&s;eful Enquiry here, and worthy our giving an Account of, could we come to a Certainty in it, namely, what was the Mark that God &s;et upon <HI>Cain,</HI> by which he was kept from being fallen upon by <HI>Abel</HI>'s Friends or Relations? but as this does not belong to the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, and it was God's Mark, not the <HI>Devil</HI>'s, I have nothing to do with it here.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devil</HI> had now gain'd his Point, the King|dom of Grace, &s;o newly erected, had been as it were extinct without a new Creation, had not <HI>Adam</HI> and <HI>Eve</HI> been alive, and had not <HI>Eve,</HI> tho' now 130 Years of Age, been a breeding young Lady, for we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the Women, in that State of Longevity, bare Children till they were &s;even or
<PB N="124" REF="132">
eight hundred Year old: This Teeming of <HI>Eve</HI> peopled not the World &s;o much as it re&s;tor|ed the ble&s;&s;ed Race; for tho' <HI>Abel</HI> was kill'd, <HI>Cain</HI> had a numerous Offspring pre&s;ently, which had <HI>Seth, (Adam</HI>'s third Son) never been born, would &s;oon have repleni&s;h'd the World with People, &s;uch as they were; the Seed of a Murther|er, cur&s;ed of God, branded with a Mark of Infamy, and who afterwards fell all together in the univer&s;al Ruine of the Race by the Deluge.</P>
<P>But after the Murther of <HI>Abel, Adam</HI> had ano|ther Son born, namely, <HI>Seth,</HI> the Father of <HI>Enos,</HI> and indeed the Father of the holy Race; for du|ring his Time and his Son <HI>Enos,</HI> the Text &s;ays that Men began to call on the Name of the Lord; that is to &s;ay, they began to look back upon <HI>Cain</HI> and his wicked Race, and being convinc'd of the Wickedne&s;s they had committed, and led their whole Po&s;terity into, they began to &s;ue to Heaven for Pardon of what was pa&s;t, and to lead a new &s;ort of Life.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Devil</HI> had met with too much Succe&s;s in his fir&s;t Attempts, not to go on with his ge|neral Re&s;olution of debauching the Minds of Men, and bringing them off from God; and therefore as he kept his Hold upon <HI>Cain</HI>'s cur&s;ed Race, em|broil'd already in Blood and Murther; &s;o he pro|ceeded with his degenerate Offspring, till in a Word he brought both the holy Seed and the degenerate Race to join in one univer&s;al Con&s;ent of Crime, and to go on in it with &s;uch aggra|vating Circum&s;tances, as that it repented the Lord that he had made Man, and he re&s;olv'd to overwhelm them again with a general De&s;truc|tion, and clear the World of them.</P>
<P>The Succe&s;&s;ion of Blood in the royal original Line of <HI>Adam,</HI> is pre&s;erv'd in the &s;acred Hi&s;tories and brought down as low as <HI>Noah</HI> and his three

Sons, for a continu'd &s;eries of 1540 Years, &s;ay &s;ome, 1640 &s;ay others; in which Time Sin &s;pread it &s;elf &s;o generally thro' the whole Race, and <HI>the Sons of God,</HI> &s;o the Scripture calls the Men of the righteous Seed, the Progeny of <HI>Seth,</HI> came in unto the <HI>Daughters of Men,</HI> that is, join'd them|&s;elves to the curs'd Race of <HI>Cain,</HI> and married promi&s;cuou&s;ly with them, according to their Fan|cies, the Women it &s;eems being beautiful and tempting; and tho' the Devil could not make the Women hand&s;ome or ugly on one or other Families, yet he might work up the Gu&s;t of wicked Incli|nation on either Side, &s;o as to make both the Men and Women tempting and agreeable to one another, where they ought not to have been &s;o; and perhaps, as it is often &s;een to this Day, the more tempting for being under legal Re&s;traint.</P>
<P>It is objected here, that we do not find in the Scripture that the Men of either Race were at that Time forbid intermarrying with one another; and it is true, that literally it is not forbid; but if we did not &s;earch rather to make doubts than to explain them, we might &s;uppo&s;e it was forbid|den by &s;ome particular Command at that Time; &s;eeing we may rea&s;onably allow every Thing to be forbidden, which they are tax'd with a Crime in committing; and as the Sons of God taking them Wives as they thought fit to choo&s;e, tho' from among the Daughters of the cur&s;ed Race, is there charg'd upon them as a general Depravation, and a great Crime, and for which, 'tis &s;aid, GOD even repented that he had made them, we need go no farther to &s;atisfy our &s;elves that it was certainly forbidden.</P>
<P><HI>Satan</HI> no doubt too had a Hand in this Wick|edne&s;s, for as it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s to prompt Men to do every Thing which God had prohibited, &s;o the Rea&s;on given why the Men of tho&s;e Days
<PB N="126" REF="134">
did this Thing was, they &s;aw the Daughters of Men, that is of the wicked Race or forbidden Sort, <HI>were fair,</HI> he tempted them by the Lu&s;t of the Eye; in a Word, the Ladies were beautiful and agreeable, and the <HI>Devil</HI> knew how to make u&s;e of the Allurement; the Men liked and took them by the meer Direction of their Fancy and Appetite, without regarding the &s;upreme Pro|hibition; <HI>They took them Wives of all which they cho&s;e,</HI> or &s;uch as they lik'd to choo&s;e.</P>
<P>But the Text adds, that this promi&s;cuous Ge|neration went farther than the meer outward Crime of it, for it &s;hew'd that the Wickedne&s;s of the Heart of Man was great before God, and that he re&s;ented it; In &s;hort, God perceived a Dege|neracy or Defect of Virtue had &s;eiz'd upon the whole Race, that there was a general Corruption of Manners and a Depravity of Nature upon them, that even the holy Seed was tained with it, that the Devil had broken in upon them, and prevail'd to a great Degree; that not only the Practice of the Age was corrupt, for that God could ea&s;ily have re&s;train'd, but that the very Heart of Man was debauch'd, his De&s;ires wholly vitiated, and his Sen&s;es engag'd in it; &s;o that in a Word, it became nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew the divine Di&s;plea&s;ure, not in the ordinary Manner, by Judgment and Re|proo&s;s of &s;uch kind as u&s;ually reclaim Men, but by a general De&s;truction to &s;weep them away, clear the Earth of them, and put an End to the Wickedne&s;s at once, removing the Offence and the Offenders all together; this is &s;ignify'd at large, Gen. vi. 5. <HI>God &s;aw that the Wickedne&s;s of Man was great in the Earth, and that every Imagination of the Thoughts of his Heart was only evil continu|ally.</HI> And again $ 11, 12. <HI>The Earth al&s;o was corrupt before God; and the Earth was fill'd with Violence. And God look'd upon the Earth, and be|hold</HI>
<PB N="127" REF="135">
<HI>it was corrupt; for all Fle&s;h had corrupted his Way upon the Earth.</HI></P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd it was a &s;trange Conque&s;t the <HI>Devil</HI> had made in the Antediluvian World, that he had, as I may &s;ay, brought the whole Race of Mankind into a general Revolt from God; <HI>Noah</HI> was indeed a Preacher of Righte|ou&s;ne&s;s, and he had preach'd about 500 Years to as little Purpo&s;e as mo&s;t of the good Mini&s;ters ever did; for we do not read there was one Man converted by him, or at lea&s;t not one of them left, for that at the Deluge there was either none of them alive, or none &s;par'd but <HI>Noah</HI> and his three Sons, and their Wives; and even they are ('tis evi|dent) recorded, not &s;o much to be &s;av'd for their own Goodne&s;s, but becau&s;e they were his Sons; Nay, without Breach of Charity we may conclude, that at lea&s;t one went to the <HI>Devil</HI> even of tho&s;e three, namely, <HI>Canaan</HI> for triumph|ing in a brutal Manner over his Father's Drunk|enne&s;s; for we find the &s;pecial Cur&s;e reach'd to him and his Po&s;terity for many Ages; and whether it went no farther than the pre&s;ent State of Life with them, we cannot tell.</P>
<P>We will &s;uppo&s;e now that thro' this whole 1500 Years the Devil having &s;o effectually debauch'd Mankind, had advanc'd his infernal Kingdom to a prodigious Height; for the Text &s;ays, <HI>the whole Earth was fill'd with Violence;</HI> in a Word, Blood, Murder, Rape, Robbery, Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju&s;tice prevail'd every where, and Man, like the wild Bear in the Fore&s;t, liv'd by Prey, biting and devouring one another.</P>
<P>At this Time <HI>Noah</HI> begins to preach a new Doctrine to them, for as he had before been a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, now he becomes a Preacher of Vengeance; fir&s;t he tells them they &s;hall be all overwhelm'd with a Deluge, that
<PB N="128" REF="136">
that for their Sins God repented they were made, and that he would de&s;troy them all, adding, that to prevent the Ruin of him&s;elf and Family, he re&s;olv'd to build him a Ship to have recour&s;e to when the Water &s;hould come over the Re&s;t of the World.</P>
<P>What Je&s;ting, what Scorn, what Contempt did this Work expo&s;e the good old Man to $or above a 100 Year? for &s;o long the Work was building, as antient Authors &s;ay; let us repre&s;ent to our &s;elves in the mo&s;t lively Manner how the witty World at that Time behav'd to poor $'d <HI>Noah;</HI> how they took their Evening Walks to $Word$ what he was doing, and pa&s;&s;ed their Judgment upon it, and upon the Progre&s;s of it; I &s;ay, $o repre&s;ent this to our &s;elves, we need go no fu$|ther than to our own Witici&s;ms upon Religion, and upon the mo&s;t &s;olemn My&s;teries of Divine Wor&s;hip; how we damn the Serious for $Word$|&s;ia&s;ts, think the Grave mad, and the Sober me|lancholy; call Religion it &s;elf Flatus and Hyp|po; make the Devout ignorant, the Divine mer|cenary, and the whole Scheme of Divinity a Frame of Prie&s;tcraft; and thus no doubt the building an Ark or Boat, or whatever they call'd it, to float over the Mountains and dance over the Plains, what could it be but a religious Fren$y, and the Man that &s;o bu&s;ied him&s;elf, a Lunatick? and all this in an Age when divine Things came by immediate Revelation into the Minds of Men! the <HI>Devil</HI> mu&s;t therefore have made a &s;trange Conque&s;t upon Mankind to obliterate all the Reverence, which but a little before was &s;o &s;trangely impre&s;s'd upon them concerning their Maker.</P>

the univer&s;al Monarch, nay the God of this World; and as all Tyrants do, he governs them with an arbitrary ab&s;olute Sway; and had not God thought fit to give him a Writ of Ejectment, and afterwards drown him out of Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, I know not what would have been the Ca&s;e, he might have kept his Hold for ought I know till the Seed of the Woman came to brui&s;e his Head, that is to &s;ay, cripple his Government, Dethrone him and Depo&s;e his Power, as has been fulfill'd in the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Of the Devil's &s;econd Kingdom, and how he got footing in the renew'd World by his Victory over</HI> Noah <HI>and his Race.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THE Story of <HI>Noah,</HI> his building the Ark, his embarking him&s;elf and all Nature's Stock for a new World on board it; the long Voyage they took, and the bad Weather they met with, tho' it would embelli&s;h this Work very well, and
<PB N="130" REF="138">
come in very much to the Purpo&s;e in this Place; yet as it does not belong to the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Story, for I cannot prove what &s;ome &s;ugge&s;t <HI>(viz.)</HI> that he was in the Ark among the Re&s;t, I &s;ay, for that Rea&s;on I mu&s;t omit it.</P>
<P>And now having mention'd Satan's being in the Ark; as I &s;ay, I cannot prove it, &s;o there are, I think, &s;ome good Rea&s;ons to believe he was not there: <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I know no Bu&s;ine&s;s he had there; <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> we read of no Mi&s;chief done there, and the&s;e join'd together make me conclude he was ab|&s;ent; the la&s;t I chiefly in&s;i&s;t upon, that we read of no Mi&s;chief done there, which if he had been in the Ark, would certainly have happen'd; and there|fore I &s;uppo&s;e rather, that when he &s;aw his Kingdom di&s;&s;olv'd, his Subjects all ingulph'd in an inevitable Ruin and De&s;olation, a Sight &s;uitable enough to him, except as it might unking him for a Time; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> when he &s;aw this, he took care to &s;peed him&s;elf away as well as he could, and make his Retreat to a Place of Safety, where that was, is no more difficult to us, than it was to him.</P>
<P>It is &s;ugge&s;ted that as he is Prince of the Power of the Air, he retir'd only into that Region. It is mo&s;t rational to &s;uppo&s;e he went no farther on many Accounts, of which I &s;hall &s;peak by and by: Here he &s;tay'd hovering in the Earth's Atmo&s;|phere, as he has often done &s;ince, and perhaps now does; or if the Atmo&s;phere of this Globe was affected by the Indraft of the Ab&s;orption, as &s;ome think, then he kept him&s;elf upon the Watch, to &s;ee what the Event of the new Phaenomenon would be, and this Watch, wherever it was, I doubt not, was as near the Earth as he could place him&s;elf, perhaps in the Atmo&s;phere of the Moon, or in a Word, the next Place of Retreat he could find.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="139">
From hence I take upon me to in&s;i&s;t, that <HI>Sa|tan</HI> has not a more certain Knowledge of Events than we; I &s;ay, he has not a <HI>more certain Know|ledge;</HI> that he may be able to make &s;tronger Con|jectures and more rational Conclu&s;ions from what he &s;ees, I will not deny; and that which he mo&s;t outdoes us in is, that he &s;ees more to conclude from than we can, but I am &s;atisfied he knows no|thing of Futurity more than he can &s;ee by Ob&s;er|vation and Inference; nor, <HI>for Example,</HI> did he know whether God would repeople the World any more or no.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t therefore allow that he only waited to &s;ee what would be the Event of this &s;trange E|ruption of Water, and what God purpos'd to do with the Ark, and all that was in it.</P>
<P>Some Philo&s;ophers tell us, be&s;ides what I hinted above, that the <HI>Devil</HI> could have no Retreat in the Earth's Atmo&s;phere, for that the Air being wholly condens'd into Water, and having continual|ly pour'd down its Streams to deluge the Earth, that Body was become &s;o &s;mall, and had &s;uffer'd &s;uch Convul&s;ions, that there was but ju&s;t enough Air left to &s;urround the Water, or as might &s;erve by its Pre&s;&s;ure to pre&s;erve the natural Po&s;ition of Things, and &s;upply the Creatures in the Ark with a Part to breath in.</P>
<P>The Atmo&s;phere indeed might &s;uffer &s;ome &s;trange and unnatural Motions at that Time, but not (I be|live) to that Degree, however, I will not affirm that there could be room in it, or is now for the Devil, much le&s;s for all the numberle&s;s Legions of Sa|tan's Ho&s;t; but there was and now certainly is, &s;uf|ficient Space to receive him, and a &s;ufficient Body of his Troops for the Bu&s;ine&s;s he had for them at that Time, and that's enough to the Purpo&s;e; or if the Earth's Atmo&s;phere did &s;uffer any particular Convul&s;ion on that Occa&s;ion, he might make his
<PB N="132" REF="140">
Retreat to the Atmo&s;phere of the Moon, or of <HI>Mars,</HI> or of <HI>Venus,</HI> or of any of the other Pla|nets; or to any other Place, for he that is Prince of the Air could not want Retreats in &s;uch a Ca&s;e, from whence he might watch for the I&s;&s;ue of Things; certainly he did not go far, becau&s;e his Bu&s;ine&s;s lay here, and he never goes out of his Way of doing Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>In particular, his more than ordinary Concern was, to &s;ee what would become of the Ark; he was wi&s;e enough doubtle&s;s to &s;ee, that GOD, who had directed its making, nay even the very Struc|ture of it, would certainly take Care of it, pre&s;erve it upon the Water, and bring it to &s;ome Place of Safety or other; tho' where it &s;hould be, the <HI>Devil</HI> with all his Cunning could not re&s;olve, whether on the &s;ame Surface the Waters draw|ing off, or in any other created or to be created Place; and this State of Uncertainty being evi|dently his Ca&s;e, and which proves his Ignorance of Futurity, it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> to watch the utmo&s;t vigilance for the Event.</P>
<P>If the Ark was (as Mr. <HI>Burnet</HI> thinks) guided by two Angels, they not only held it from foun|dring or being &s;wallow'd up in the Water, but certainly kept the Waters calm about it, e&s;pecially when the Lord brought a &s;trong Wind to blow over the whole Globe, which by the Way was the fir&s;t, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, the only univer&s;al Storm that ever blew, for to be &s;ure it blew over the whole Surface at once; I &s;ay, if it was thus guided, to be &s;ure the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;aw it, and that with Envy and Regret that he could do it no Jnjury, for doubt|le&s;s had it been in the Devil's Power, as God had drown'd the whole Race of Man, except what was in the Ark, he would have taken care to have di&s;patch'd them too, and &s;o made an End of the Creation at once; but either he was not empowr'd
<PB N="133" REF="141">
to go to the Ark, or it was &s;o well guarded by Angels, that when he came near it he could do it no harm: So it re&s;ted at length, the Waters abating on the Mountains of <HI>Arrarat</HI> in <HI>Armenia,</HI> or &s;ome where el&s;e that Way, and where they &s;ay a Piece of the Keel is remaining to this Day, of which, however with Dr.&mdash;I &s;ay, I be|lieve not one Word.</P>
<P>The Ark being &s;afe landed, 'tis rea&s;onable to believe <HI>Noah</HI> prepar'd to go on Shore, as the Sea|men call it, as &s;oon as the dry Land began to ap|pear; and here you mu&s;t allow me to &s;uppo&s;e Satan, tho' him&s;elf cloth'd with a Cloud, &s;o as not to be &s;een, came immediately, and pearching on the Roof, &s;aw all the Heaven-kept Hou&s;hold &s;afely landed, and all the Ho&s;t of living Creatures di&s;per&s;ing them&s;elves down the Sides of the Moun|tain, as the Search of their Food or other proper Occa&s;ions directed them.</P>
<P>This Sight was enough; Satan was at no Lo&s;s to conclude from hence that the De&s;ign of God was to repeople the World by the Way of ordi|nary Generation, from the Po&s;terity of the&s;e eight Per&s;ons, without creating any new Species.</P>
<P>Very well, &s;ays the <HI>Devil,</HI> then my Advan|tage over them, by the Snare I laid for poor <HI>Eve,</HI> is good &s;till; and I am now ju&s;t where I was after <HI>Adam</HI>'s Expul&s;ion from the Garden, and when I had <HI>Cain</HI> and his Race to go to work with; for here is the old expung'd Corrupted Race &s;till, as <HI>Cain</HI> was the Object then, &s;o <HI>Noah</HI> is my Man now, and if I do not ma&s;ter him one way or another, I am mi&s;taken in my Mark. <HI>Pardon me for making a Speech for</HI> the Devil.</P>
<P><HI>Noah</HI> big with a Sen&s;e of his late Condition, and while the Wonders of the Deluge were fre&s;h in his Mind, &s;pent his fir&s;t Days in the Exta&s;ies of his Soul, giving Thanks, and prai&s;ing the Power

that had been his Protection, in and thro' the Flood of Waters, and which had in &s;o miraculous a Manner, &s;afely landed him on the Surface of the newly di&s;cover'd Land; and the Text tells us, as one of the fir&s;t Things he was employ'd in, <HI>He built an Altar unto the Lord, and offered Burnt-Of|frings upon the Altar.</HI> Gen. viii. 20.</P>
<P>While <HI>Noah</HI> was thus employ'd he was &s;afe, the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf could no where break in upon him; and we may &s;uppo&s;e very rea&s;onably, as he found the old Father invulnerable, he left him for &s;ome Years, watching notwith&s;tanding all po&s;&s;ible Advantages again&s;t his Sons and their Children; for now the Family began to encrea&s;e, and <HI>Noah</HI>'s Sons had &s;everal Children; whether him&s;elf had any more Children after the Flood or not, that we are not arriv'd to any Certainty about.</P>
<P>Among his Sons the <HI>Devil</HI> found <HI>Japhet</HI> and <HI>Shem,</HI> good, pious, religious, and very devout Per|&s;ons; &s;erving God daily, after the Example of their good old Father <HI>Noah,</HI> and he could make no|thing of them, or of any of their Po&s;terity; but <HI>Ham</HI> the &s;econd, or according to &s;ome, the young|er Son of <HI>Noah,</HI> had a Son who was nam'd <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> a loo&s;e young profligate Fellow, his Edu|cation was probably but cur&s;ory and &s;uperficial, his Father <HI>Ham</HI> being not near &s;o religious and &s;erious a Man as his Brothers <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet</HI> were; and as <HI>Canaan</HI>'s Education was defective, &s;o he prov'd, as untaught Youth generally do, a wild and in &s;hort a very wicked Fellow, and con|&s;equently a fit Tool for the <HI>Devil</HI> to go to work with.</P>
<P><HI>Noah,</HI> a diligent indu&s;trious Man, being with all his Family thus planted in the rich fruitful Plains of <HI>Armenia,</HI> or wherever you plea&s;e, let it be near the Mountains of <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> or <HI>Arrarat;</HI> went immediately to work, cultivating and improv|ing

the Soil, encrea&s;ing his Cattle and Pa&s;tures, &s;ow|ing Corn, and among other Things planting Trees for Food, and among the Fruit Trees he planted Vines, of the Grapes whereof he made no doubt, as they &s;till in the &s;ame Country do make mo&s;t excellent Wine, rich, lu&s;cious, &s;trong, and plea&s;ant.</P>
<P>I cannot come into the Notion of our Criticks, who to excu&s;e <HI>Noah</HI> from the Guilt of what follow|ed, or at lea&s;t from the Cen&s;ure, tell us, he knew not the Strength or the Nature of Wine, but that gathering the heavy Clu&s;ters of the Grapes, and their own weight cru&s;hing out their balmy Juices into his Hand, he ta&s;ted the tempting Li|quor, and that the <HI>Devil</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ting he was charm'd with the delicious Fragrance, and ta&s;ted again aad again, pre&s;&s;ing it out into a Bowl or Di&s;h; that he might take a larger Quantity, till at length the heady Froth a&s;cended and &s;eizing his Brain, he became intoxicate and drunk, not in the lea&s;t ima|gining there was any &s;uch Strength in the Juice of that excellent Fruit.</P>
<P>But to make out this Story, which is indeed very favourable for <HI>Noah,</HI> but in it &s;elf extremely ridiculous, you mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily fall into &s;ome Ab|&s;urdities, and beg the Que&s;tion mo&s;t egregiou&s;ly in &s;ome particular Ca&s;es, which way of arguing will by no means &s;upport what is &s;ugge&s;ted; at fir&s;t you mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e there was no &s;uch Thing as Wine made before the Deluge, and that no Body had been ever made drunk with the Juice of the Grape before <HI>Noah,</HI> which, I &s;ay, is beg|ging the Que&s;tion in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Manner.</P>
<P>If the Contrary is true, as I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to que&s;tion, if, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> it was true that there was Wine drank, and that Men were or had been drunk with it before, they cannot then but &s;up|po&s;e that <HI>Noah,</HI> who was a wi&s;e, a great and a good Man, and <HI>a Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> both
<PB N="136" REF="144">
knew of it, and without doubt had in his preach|ing again&s;t their Crimes, preach'd again&s;t this among the re&s;t, upbraided them with it, reprov'd them for it, and exhorted them again&s;t it.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> 'tis highly probable they had Grapes growing, and con&s;equently Wines made from them, in the Antediluvian World, how el&s;e did <HI>Noah</HI> come by the Vines which he planted? For we are to &s;uppo&s;e, he could plant no Trees or Shrubs, but &s;uch as he found the Roots of in the Earth, and which no doubt had been there before in their highe&s;t Perfection, and had con&s;equent|ly grown up and brought forth the &s;ame lu&s;ci|ous Fruit before.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as he found the Roots of the Vines, &s;o he under&s;tood what they were, and what Fruit they bore, or el&s;e it may be &s;uppo&s;ed al&s;o he would not have planted them; for he planted them for their Fruit, as he did it in the Provi&s;ion he was making for his Sub&s;i&s;tence, and the Sub|&s;i&s;tence of his Family; and if he did not know what they were, he would not have &s;et them, for he was not planting for Diver&s;ion but for Profit.</P>
<P>Upon the whole it &s;eems plain to me he knew what he did, as well when he planted the Vines as when he pre&s;&s;ed out the Grapes; and al&s;o when he drank the Juice that he knew it was Wine, was &s;trong and would make him drunk if he took enough of it: He knew that other Men had been drunk with &s;uch Liquor before the Flood, and that he had reprehended them for it; and there|fore it was not his Ignorance, but the <HI>Devil</HI> took him at &s;ome Advantage, when his Appetite was eager, or he thir&s;ty, and the Liquor cooling and plea&s;ant; and in &s;hort, as <HI>Eve</HI> &s;aid, <HI>the Serpent be|guiled her,</HI> and &s;he DID EAT, &s;o the Devil beguiled <HI>Noah</HI> and <HI>he</HI> DID DRINK; the Temptation was too &s;trong for <HI>Noah,</HI> not the Wine; he knew
<PB N="137" REF="145">
well enough what he did, but as the Drunkards &s;ay to this Day, it was &s;o good he could not for|bear it, and &s;o he got drunk before he was aware; or as our ordinary Speech expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>he was over|taken with drink;</HI> and Mr. <HI>Pool</HI> and other Expo|&s;itors are partly of the &s;ame Mind.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner was the poor old Man conquer'd, and the Wine had lightn'd his Head, but it may be &s;uppo&s;ed he falls off from the Chair or Bench where he &s;ate, and tumbling backward his Clothes, which in tho&s;e hot Countries were only loo&s;e open Robes, like the Ve&s;ts which the <HI>Armenians</HI> wear to this Day, flying abroad, or the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;o a&s;&s;i&s;ting on purpo&s;e to expo&s;e him, he lay there in a naked indecent Po&s;ture not fit to be &s;een.</P>
<P>In this juncture who &s;hould come by but young <HI>Canaan,</HI> &s;ay &s;ome; or as others think, this young Fellow fir&s;t attack'd him by way of Kindne&s;s and pretended Affection; prompted his Grandfather to drink, on Pretence of the Wine being good for him, and proper for the Support of his old Age, and &s;ubtilly &s;et upon him, drinking al&s;o with him, and &s;o (his Head being too &s;trong for the old Man's) drank him down, and then, <HI>Devil</HI> like, tri|umph'd over him; boa&s;ted of his Conque&s;t, in|&s;ulted the Body as it were dead, uncovered him on purpo&s;e to expo&s;e him, and leaving him in that indecent Po&s;ture, went and made Sport with it to his Father <HI>Ham,</HI> who in that Part, wicked like him&s;elf, did the &s;ame to his Brethren <HI>Japhet</HI> and <HI>Shem;</HI> but they like mode&s;t and good Men, far from carrying on the wicked In&s;ult on their Parent, went and cover'd him, as the Scripture expre&s;&s;es it, and as may be &s;uppo&s;ed inform'd him how he had been abus'd, and by who.</P>
<P>Why el&s;e &s;hould <HI>Noah,</HI> when he came to him|&s;elf, &s;hew his Re&s;entment &s;o much again&s;t <HI>Canaan</HI> his Grand&s;on, rather than again&s;t <HI>Ham</HI> his Father,
<PB N="138" REF="146">
and who 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed in the Story the guilt chief|ly lay upon? we &s;ee the Cur&s;e is (as it were) laid wholly upon <HI>Canaan</HI> the Grand&s;on, and not a Word of the Father is mention'd, Gen. ix. 25, 26, 27, <HI>Cur&s;ed be</HI> Canaan, <HI>a Servant of Servants &s;hall he be,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>That <HI>Ham</HI> was Guilty, that's certain from the Hi&s;tory of Fact, but I cannot but &s;uppo&s;e his Grand&s;on was the Occa&s;ion of it; and in this Ca&s;e the Devil &s;eems to have made <HI>Canaan</HI> the In&s;trument or Tool to delude <HI>Noah,</HI> and draw him in to Drunkenne&s;s, as he made the Serpent the Tool to beguile <HI>Eve,</HI> and draw her into Di&s;obe|dience.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly <HI>Canaan</HI> might do it without De&s;ign at fir&s;t, but might be brought in to ridicule and make a Je&s;t of the old Patriarch afterward, as is too frequent &s;ince in the Practice of our Days; but I rather believe he did it really with a wicked De&s;ign, and on Purpo&s;e to expo&s;e and in|&s;ult his Reverend old Parent; and this &s;eems more likely too, becau&s;e of the great Bitterne&s;s with which <HI>Noah</HI> re&s;ented it, after he came to be in|form'd of it.</P>
<P>But be that as it will, the <HI>Devil</HI> certainly made a great Conque&s;t here, and as to outward Ap|pearance no le&s;s than that which he gain'd be|fore over <HI>Adam;</HI> nor did the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Victory con|&s;i&s;t barely in his having drawn in the only righte|ous Man of the whole Antediluvian World, and &s;o beginning or initiating the new young Progeny with a Crime; but here was the great Oracle &s;ilenc'd at once; the Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, for &s;uch no doubt he would have been to the new World, as he was to the old, I &s;ay, the Preacher was turn'd out of Office, or his Mouth &s;topt, which was wor&s;e; nay, it was a &s;topping of his Mouth in the wor&s;t kind, far wor&s;e than &s;topping his Breath,
<PB N="139" REF="147">
for had he died, the Office had de&s;cended to his Sons <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> but he was dead to the Office of an In&s;tructor, tho' alive as to his Being; For of what Force could his Preachings be, who had thus fallen him&s;elf into the mo&s;t &s;hameful and bea&s;tly Exce&s;s?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides &s;ome are of the Opinion, tho' I hope without Ground, that <HI>Noah</HI> was not only over|taken once in his Drink, but that being fallen into that Sin it became habitual, and he continued in it a great while, and that it was this which is the meaning of his being uncovered in his Tent, and that his Son &s;aw his Nakedne&s;s; that is, he conti|nually expo&s;ed him&s;elf for a long Time, a hun|dred Years, &s;ay they, and that his Son <HI>Ham,</HI> and his Grand&s;on <HI>Canaan</HI> having drawn him into it, kept him in it, encourag'd and prompted it, and all the while Satan &s;till prompting them, join'd their Scoffs and contempt of him, with their wicked En|deavours to promote the Wickedne&s;s; and both with as much Succe&s;s as the Devil him&s;elf could wi&s;h for.</P>
<P>Then as for his two Sons mode&s;tly and decent|ly covering their Father, they tell us, that Repre|&s;ents <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet</HI> applying them&s;elves in an humble and dutiful Manner to their Father, to entreat and be&s;eech him to con&s;ider his antient Glory, his own pious Exhortations to the late drowned World, and to con&s;ider the Offence which he gave by his evil Cour&s;es to God, and the Scandal to his whole Family, and al&s;o that they are brought in effectually prevailing upon him; and that then <HI>Noah</HI> cur&s;ed the Wickedne&s;s of <HI>Ham</HI>'s degenerate Race, in Te&s;timony of his &s;incere Re|pentance after the Fact.</P>
<P>The Story is not &s;o very unlikely as it is cer|tain that it is not to be proved, and therefore we had better take it as we find it <HI>(viz.)</HI> for one &s;in|gle Act; but &s;uppo&s;e it was &s;o, 'tis &s;till certain
<PB N="140" REF="148">
that <HI>Noah</HI>'s Preaching was &s;adly interrupted, the Energy of his Words flatter'd, and the Force of his Per&s;ua&s;ions enervated and abated, by this &s;hame|ful Fall; that he was effectually &s;ilenc'd for an In&s;tructor ever after, and this was as much as the Devil had Occa&s;ion for; and therefore indeed we read little more of him, except that he lived three hundred and fifty Year after the Flood; nay, we do not &s;o much as read that he had any more Children, but the contrary, nor indeed could <HI>Noah</HI> have any more Children, except by his old and perhaps &s;uper-annuated Wife, who it was very likely he had had four or five hundred Year, unle&s;s you will &s;uppo&s;e he was allow'd to marry &s;ome of his own Progeny, Daughters or Gran|daughters, which we do not &s;uppo&s;e was allow'd, no not to <HI>Adam</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>This was certainly a Ma&s;ter-piece of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Policy, and a fatal In&s;tance of his unhappy Di|ligence <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the Door of the Ark was no &s;ooner open, and the Face of the World hardly dry from the univer&s;al De&s;truction of Mankind, but he was at work among them; and that not only to form a general Defection among the Race, upon the Foot of the original Taint of Nature, but like a bold <HI>Devil</HI> he &s;trikes at the very Root, and flies at the next general Repre&s;entative of Mankind, attacks the Head of the Family, that in his Mi&s;carriage the Ri&s;e and Progre&s;s of a Reformation of the new World &s;hould receive an early Check, and &s;hould be at once prevent|ed; I &s;ay, like a bold Devil, he &s;trikes at the Root, and <HI>alas!</HI> poor unhappy <HI>Noah,</HI> he proved too weak for him, <HI>Satan</HI> prevail'd in his very fir&s;t Attempt, and got the Victory over him at once.</P>
<P><HI>Noah</HI> thus overcome, and Satan's Conque&s;t carried on to the utmo&s;t of his own Wi&s;hes, the <HI>Devil</HI> had little more to do in the World

for &s;ome Ages, than to carry on an univer&s;al De|generacy among Mankind, and to fini&s;h it by a like diligent Application, in deluding the Generality of the Race, and them as they came on gradually into Life; this he found the le&s;s dif|ficult, becau&s;e of the fir&s;t Defection which &s;pread like a Contagion upon the Earth immediately after.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Evidence we have of his Succe&s;s in this mi&s;chievous De&s;ign was in the Building that great &s;tupendious Stair-ca&s;e, for &s;uch it &s;eems it was intended, call'd <HI>Babel,</HI> which if the whole World had not been drunk, or otherwi&s;e infatua|ted, they would never have undertaken; even Sa|tan him&s;elf could never have prevail'd with them to undertake &s;uch a prepo&s;terous Piece of Work, for it had neither End or Means, Po&s;&s;ibility or Probability in it.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t confe&s;s I am &s;ometimes apt to vindicate our old Ance&s;tors, in my Thoughts, from the Charge it &s;elf, as we generally under&s;tand it, name|ly, that they really de&s;ign'd to build a Tower which &s;hould reach up to Heaven, or that it &s;hould &s;ecure them in ca&s;e of another Flood; and Father <HI>Ca&s;aubon</HI> is of my Opinion, whether I am of his or no, is a Que&s;tion by it &s;elf; his opini|on is that the Confu&s;ion was nothing but a Breach among the Undertakers and Directors of the Work, and that the Building was de&s;ign'd chiefly for a Store-hou&s;e for Provi&s;ions, in Ca&s;e of a &s;e|cond Deluge; as to their Notion of its reaching up to Heaven, he takes the Expre&s;&s;ion to be alle|gorical rather than little, and only to mean that it &s;hould be exceeding high; perhaps they might not be A&s;tronomers enough to mea&s;ure the Di&s;|tance of Space between the Earth and Heaven, as we pretend to do now; but as <HI>Noah</HI> was then
<PB N="142" REF="150">
alive, and as we believe all his three Sons were &s;o too, they were able to have inform'd them how ab&s;urd it was to &s;uppo&s;e either the one or the other <HI>(viz.)</HI> (1.) that they could build up to Heaven, or (2.) that they could build firm enough to re&s;i&s;t, or high enough to overtop the Waters, &s;uppo&s;ing &s;uch another Flood &s;hould happen; I would ra|ther think it was only that they intended to build a mo&s;t glorious and magnificent City, where they might all inhabit together; and that this Tower was to be built for Ornament and al&s;o for Strength, or as above, and for a Store-hou&s;e to lay up va&s;t Magazines of Provi&s;ions, in Ca&s;e of extraordinary Floods or other Events, the City being built in a great Plain, namely, the Plains of <HI>Shinnar</HI> near the River <HI>Euphrates.</HI></P>
<P>But the Story, as it is recorded, &s;uits better with Satan's Mea&s;ures at that Time; and as he was from the Beginning prompting them to every Thing that was contrary to the Happine&s;s of Man, &s;o the more prepo&s;terous it was, and the more incon&s;i&s;tent with common Sen&s;e, the more to his Purpo&s;e; and it &s;hew'd the more what a compleat Conque&s;t he had gain'd over the Rea&s;on as well as the Religion of Mankind at that Time.</P>
<P>Again, 'tis evident in this Ca&s;e, they were not only acting contrary to the Nature of Things, but contrary to the De&s;ign and to the Command of Heaven; for God's Command was that they &s;hould repleni&s;h the Earth, that is, that they &s;hould &s;pread their Habitations over it, and People the whole Globe; whereas they were pitching in one Place, as if they were not to multiply &s;ufficient to take up any more.</P>
<P>But what car'd the Devil for that, or to put it a little hand&s;omer, that was what <HI>Satan</HI> aim|ed at; for it was enough to him, to bring Man|kind
<PB N="143" REF="151">
to act ju&s;t contrary to what <HI>Heaven</HI> had direct|ed or commanded them in any thing, and if po&s;&s;ible in every Thing.</P>
<P>But God him&s;elf put a &s;top to this fooli&s;h Piece of Work, and it was time indeed to do &s;o, for a madder thing the Devil him&s;elf never propo&s;ed to them; I &s;ay, God him&s;elf put a &s;top to this new Undertaking, and di&s;appointed the Devil; and how was it done? not in Judgment and An|ger, as perhaps the Devil expected and hop'd for, but as pitying the Simplicity of that dreaming Creature Man, he confu&s;ed their Speech, or as &s;ome &s;ay, divided and confu&s;ed their Councils, &s;o that they could not agree with one another, which would be the &s;ame Thing as not to under&s;tand one another; or he put a new Shibboleth upon their Tongues, thereby &s;eparating them into Tribes or Families, for by this every Family found them&s;elves under a Nece&s;&s;ity of keeping together, and this naturally encrea&s;ed that Differing Jargons of Language, for at fir&s;t it might be no more.</P>
<P>What a Confu&s;ion this was to them we all know, by their being oblig'd to leave off their building, and immediately &s;eparating one from another; but what a Surprize it was to the old Serpent, that remains to be con&s;idered of, for in|deed it belongs to his Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Satan had never met with any Di&s;appointment in all his wicked Attempts till now; for fir&s;t, he &s;ucceeded even to triumph upon <HI>Eve,</HI> he did the like upon <HI>Cain,</HI> and in &s;hort upon the whole World, <HI>one Man</HI> (Noah) <HI>excepted;</HI> when he blend|ed the Sons of God, and the Daughters of Hell, for &s;o the Word is under&s;tood, together, in pro|mi&s;cuous voluptuous Living as well as Genera|tion.</P>
<P>As to the Deluge, Authors are not agreed whe|ther it was a Di&s;appointment to the Devil or no,
<PB N="144" REF="152">
it might be indeed a Surprize to him, for tho' <HI>Noah</HI> had preach'd of it for a hundred Year toge|ther, yet as he <HI>(Satan)</HI> daily prompted the People not to heed or believe what that old Fellow <HI>Noah</HI> &s;aid to them, and to ridicule his whim&s;ical Build|ing a mon&s;trous Tub to &s;wim or float in, when the &s;aid Deluge &s;hould come; &s;o I am of the Opi|nion he did not believe it him&s;elf, and am po&s;itive he could not fore&s;ee it, by any in&s;ight into Fu|turity that he was Ma&s;ter of.</P>
<P>'Tis true the A&s;tronomers tell us, there was a very terrible Comet &s;een in the Air, that it ap|peared for 180 Days before the Flood continual|ly; and that as it approach'd nearer and nearer every Day all the while, &s;o that at la&s;t it bur&s;t and fell down in a continual Spout or Stream of Water, being of a watry Sub&s;tance, and the Quantity &s;o great, that it was forty Days a falling, &s;o that this Comet not only foretold the Deluge or drowning of the Earth, but actually perform'd it, and drown'd it from it &s;elf.</P>
<P>But to leave this Tale to them that told it, let us con&s;ider the Devil, &s;urpris'd, and a little amaz'd at the Ab&s;orption or Inundation, or what|ever we are to call it, of the Earth in the Deluge, not, I &s;ay, that he was much concern'd at it, per|haps ju&s;t the Contrary; and if God would drown it again, and as often as he thought fit, I do not &s;ee by any thing I meet with in Satan's Hi&s;tory, or in the Nature of him, that he would be at all di&s;turb'd at it; all that I can &s;ee in it, that could give Satan any Concern, would be that all his Fa|vourites were gone, and he had his Work to do over again, to lay a Foundation for a new Conque&s;t in the Generation that was to come; But in this his Pro&s;pect was fair enough, for why &s;hould he be di&s;couraged, when he had now eight People to work upon, who met with &s;uch Succe&s;s when he
<PB N="145" REF="153">
had but two? and why &s;hould he que&s;tion break|ing in now where Nature was already vitiated and corrupted, when he had before conquer'd the &s;ame Nature, when in its primitive Rectitude and Purity, ju&s;t come out of the Hands of its Maker, and fortify'd with the Awe of his high and &s;o|lemn Command ju&s;t given them, and the threat|ning of Death al&s;o annext to it, if broken?</P>
<P>But I go back to the Affair of <HI>Babel:</HI> This Confu&s;ion of Language or of Councils, take it which way you will, was the fir&s;t Di&s;appoint|ment that I find the Devil met with, in all his At|tempts and Practices upon Mankind, or upon the new Creation, which I mention'd above; for now he fore&s;aw what would follow; namely, that the People would &s;eparate and &s;pread them&s;elves over the whole Surface of the Earth, and a thou&s;and new Scenes of Action would appear, in which he therefore prepares him&s;elf to behave as he &s;hould &s;ee Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>How the Devil learn'd to &s;peak all the Lan|guages that were now to be u&s;ed, and how many Languages they were, the &s;everal antient Wri|ters of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Story have not yet determin|ed; &s;ome tell us they were divided only into fif|teen, &s;ome into &s;eventy two, others into one hun|dred and eighty, and others again into &s;everal Thou&s;ands.</P>
<P>It al&s;o remains a Doubt with me, and, I &s;uppo&s;e, will be &s;o with others al&s;o, whether Satan has yet found out a Method to conver&s;e with Mankind, without the Help of Language and Words, or not: &s;eeing Man has no other Medium of Con|ver&s;ing, no not with him&s;elf: This I have not time to enter upon here; however, this &s;eems plain to me <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;oon learn'd to make Mankind under&s;tand him, whatever Lan|guage he &s;poke, and no doubt but he found
<PB N="146" REF="154">
Ways and Means to under&s;tand them, whatever Language they &s;poke.</P>
<P>After the Confu&s;ion of Languages, the People nece&s;&s;arily &s;orted them&s;elves into Families and Tribes, every Family under&s;tanding their own particular Speech, and that only; and the&s;e Fa|milies multiplying grew into Nations, and tho&s;e Nations wanting Room, and &s;eeking out Habi|tations, wandred &s;ome this Way, &s;ome that, till they found out Countries re&s;pectively proper for their &s;ettling, and there they became a Kingdom, &s;preading and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing &s;till more and more Land as their People encrea&s;ed, till at la&s;t the whole Earth was &s;carce big enough for them: This pre|&s;ented <HI>Satan</HI> with an Opportunity to break in upon their Morals at another Door, <HI>(viz.)</HI> their Pride; for Men being naturally proud and envi|ous, Nations and Tribes began to jo&s;tle with one another for Room; either one Nation enjoy'd better Accommdoations, or had a better Soil or a more favourable Climate than another; and the&s;e being numerous and &s;trong thru&s;t the other out, and encroach'd upon their Land; the other liking their Situation, prepare for their Defence, and &s;o began Oppre&s;&s;ion, Inva&s;ion, War, Battle and Blood, Satan all the while beating the Drums, and his Attendants clapping their Hand, as Men do when they &s;et Dogs on upon one another.</P>
<P>The bringing Mankind thus to <HI>War</HI> and <HI>Con|fu&s;ion,</HI> as it was the fir&s;t Game the Devil play'd after the confounding of Languages and Divi&s;ions at <HI>Babel,</HI> &s;o it was a Conque&s;t upon Mankind, purely devili&s;h, born from Hell, and &s;o exactly tinctured with Satan's original Sin <HI>Ambition,</HI> that it really transform'd Men into meer Devils; for when is Man transform'd into the very Image of Satan him&s;elf, when is he turn'd into a meer Devil, if it is not when he is fighting with his
<PB N="147" REF="155">
fellow Creatures, and dipping his Hands in the Blood of his own Kind? Let his Picture be con&s;ider'd, the Fire of Hell flames or &s;parkles in his Eyes, a voracious Grin &s;its upon his Coun|tenance; Rage and Fury di&s;tort the Mu&s;cles of his Face; his Pa&s;&s;ions agitate his whole Body, and he is metamorphos'd from a comely Beauteous angelic Creature into a <HI>Fury,</HI> a <HI>Satyr,</HI> a terrible and frightful Mon&s;ter, nay, into a <HI>Devil;</HI> for <HI>Sa|tan</HI> him&s;elf is de&s;crib'd by the &s;ame Word which on his very Account is chang'd into a Sub&s;tan|tive, and the Devils are call'd <HI>Furies.</HI></P>
<P>This &s;owing the Seeds of Strife in the World, and bringing Nations to fight and make War upon one another, would take up a great Part of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, and abundance of extraor|dinary Things would occur in relating the par|ticulars; for there have been very great Conflagra|tions kindled in the World, by the Artifice of Hell, under this Head, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of making War; in which it has been the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Ma&s;ter-piece, and he has indeed &s;hewn him&s;elf a Workman in it, that he has wheedled Mankind into &s;trange un|natural Notions of Things, in order to propagate and &s;upport the fighting Principle in the World; &s;uch as Laws of War, fair fighting, behaving like Men of Honour, fighting to the la&s;t Drop, and the like, by which killing and murthering is under&s;tood to be ju&s;tifiable. Virtue and a true Greatne&s;s of Spirit is rated now by Rules which God never appointed, and the Standard of Ho|nour is quite different from that of Rea&s;on and of Nature: Bravery is denominated not from a fear|le&s;s undaunted Spirit in the ju&s;t Defence of Life and Liberty, but from a daring Defiance of God and Man, fighting, killing and treading under Foot his fellow Creatures, at the ordinary Com|mand of the Officer, whether it be right or wrong,
<PB N="148" REF="156">
and whether it be in a ju&s;t Defence of Life, and our Country's Life, that is Liberty, or whether it be for the Support of Injury and Oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>A prudent avoiding cau&s;ele&s;s Quarrel is call'd Cowardice, and to take an Affront Ba&s;ene&s;s, and Meanne&s;s of Spirit; to refu&s;e fighting, and putting Life at a Ca&s;t on the Point of a Sword, a Practice forbid by the Laws of God and of all good Government, is yet call'd Cowardice; and a Man is bound to die duelling, or live and be laugh'd at.</P>
<P>This trumping up the&s;e imaginary Things call'd Bravery and Gallantry, naming them Virtue and Honour, is all from the <HI>Devil</HI>'s new Management, and his &s;ubtil influencing the Minds of Men to fly in the Face of God and Nature, and to act again&s;t his Sen&s;es; nor but for his Artifice in the Management, could it be po&s;&s;ible that &s;uch In|con&s;i&s;tencies could go down with Mankind, or they could pa&s;s &s;uch ab&s;urd Things among them for rea&s;oning; for Example, A is found in Bed with B's Wife, B is the Per&s;on injur'd, and there|fore offended, and coming into the Chamber with his Sword in his Hand, A exclaims loudly, <HI>Why Sir, you won't murther me, will you? as you are a Man of Honour let me ri&s;e and take my Sword.</HI></P>
<P>A very good Story indeed! fit for no body but the Devil to put into any Man's Head; But &s;o it is, B being put in mind, for&s;ooth, that he is <HI>a Man of Honour,</HI> &s;tarts back and mu&s;t act the honourable Part; &s;o he lets A get up, put on his Clothes and take his Sword; then they fight, and B is kill'd for his Honour; whereas had the Laws of God, of Nature and of Rea&s;on taken Place, the Adulterer and the Adultre&s;s &s;hould have been taken Pri&s;oners and carried before the Judge, and being taken in the Fact, &s;hould have been immediately &s;entenc'd, he to the Block and &s;he to the Stake, and the innocent abus'd Hus|band
<PB N="149" REF="157">
had no Rea&s;on to have run any Ri&s;que of his Life for being made a Cuckold.</P>
<P>But thus has <HI>Satan</HI> abus'd the Rea&s;on of Man, and if a Man does me the greate&s;t Injury in the World, I mu&s;t do my &s;elf Ju&s;tice upon him, by venturing my Life upon an even Lay with him, and mu&s;t fight him upon equal Hazard, in which the injur'd Per&s;on is as often kill'd as the Per&s;on offering the Injury: Suppo&s;e now it be in the &s;ame Ca&s;e <HI>as above,</HI> a Man abu&s;es my Wife, and then to give me Satisfaction, tells me, he will fight me, which the <HI>French</HI> call <HI>doing me Rea&s;on; No Sir,</HI> &s;ay I, <HI>let me lie with your Wife too, and then if you de&s;ire it, I may fight you; then I am upon even Terms with you;</HI> but this indeed is the rea&s;oning which the <HI>Devil</HI> has brought Mankind too at this Day: But to go back to the Subject, <HI>viz.</HI> the Devil bringing the Nations to fall out, and to quarrel for Room in the World, and &s;o to fight in order to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s one another of their Settlements: This began at a Time when certainly there were Places enough in the World for every one to choo&s;e in, and therefore the <HI>Devil,</HI> not the want of Elbow|room, mu&s;t be the Occa&s;ion of it; and 'tis carried on ever &s;ince, as apparently from the &s;ame Intere&s;t, and by the &s;ame original.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall meet with this Part again very often in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Story, and as we bring him farther on in the Management of Mankind; I therefore lay it by for the Pre&s;ent, and come to the next Step the <HI>Devil</HI> took with Mankind after the Confu&s;ion of Languages, and this was in the Affair of Wor&s;hip; It does not appear yet that ever the <HI>Devil</HI> was &s;o bold, as either,</P>
<P N="1">1. To &s;et him&s;elf up to be wor&s;hip'd as a God, or which was &s;till wor&s;e,</P>
<P N="2">2. To per&s;uade Men to believe there was no God at all to wor&s;hip.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="158">
Both the&s;e are introduc'd &s;ince the Deluge, <HI>one</HI> indeed by the <HI>Devil,</HI> who &s;oon found Means to &s;et him&s;elf up for a God in many Parts of the World, and holds it to this Day; but the <HI>la&s;t</HI> is brought in by the Invention of Men, in which it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd Man has out-&s;in'd the Devil; for to do Satan Ju&s;tice, he never thought it could ever pa&s;s upon Mankind, or that any Thing &s;o gro&s;s would go down with them; &s;o that <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> the&s;e modern Ca&s;ui&s;ts, in the Reach of our Days, have, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> out-&s;in'd the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>As then both the&s;e are moderen Inventions, <HI>Sa|tan</HI> went on gradually, and being to work upon humane Nature by Stratagem, not by Force, it would have been too gro&s;s to have &s;et him&s;elf up as an Object of Wor&s;hip at fir&s;t, it was to be done Step by Step; <HI>for Example.</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. It was &s;ufficient to bring Mankind to a Neglect of God, to wor&s;hip him by halves, and give little or no Regard to his Laws, and &s;o grow loo&s;e and immoral, in direct Con|tradiction to his Commands; this would not go down with them at fir&s;t, &s;o the Devil went on gradually.</P>
<P N="2">2. From a Negligence in wor&s;hipping the true GOD, he by Degrees introduc'd the wor|&s;hip of fal&s;e GODS; and to introduce this he began with the <HI>Sun, Moon</HI> and <HI>Stars,</HI> call'd in the holy Text the Ho&s;t of Heaven; the&s;e had a greater Maje&s;ty upon them, and &s;eem'd fitter to command the Homage of Mankind; &s;o it was not the harde&s;t Thing in the World, to bring Men, when they had once forgotton the true God, to embrace the Wor&s;hip of &s;uch Gods as tho&s;e.</P>
<P N="3">3. Having thus debauch'd their Principles in Wor&s;hip, and led them from the true and
<PB N="151" REF="159">
only Object of Wor&s;hip to a fal&s;e, it was the ea&s;ier to carry them on; &s;o in a few Grada|tions more he brought them to downright Idolatry, and even in that Idolatry he proceed|ed gradually too; for he began with awful Names, &s;uch as were venerable in the Thoughts of Men, as BAAL or BELL, which, in <HI>Chaldaick</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> &s;ignifies Lord or Sovereign, or Mighty and Magnificent, and this was therefore a Name a&s;crib'd at fir&s;t to the true God, but afterwards they de|&s;cended to make Images and Figures to re|pre&s;ent him, and then they were call'd by the &s;ame Name as <HI>Baal, Baalim,</HI> and after|wards <HI>Bell,</HI> from which, by a helli&s;h Dege|neracy, Saturn brought Mankind to adore every Block of their own hewing, and to wor&s;hiping Stocks, Stones, Mon&s;ters, Hob|goblins, and every &s;ordid frightful Thing, and at la&s;t the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf.</P>
<P>What Notions &s;ome People may entertain of the Forwardne&s;s of the fir&s;t Ages of the World, to run into Idolatry, I do not enquire here; I know they tell us &s;trange Things, of its being the Product of meer Nature, one remove from its primitive State; but I, who pretend to have &s;o critically enquir'd into <HI>Satan</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, can a&s;&s;ure you, and that from very good Authority, that the <HI>Devil</HI> did not find it &s;o ea&s;y a task to obliterate the Know|ledge of the true God, in the Minds and Con|&s;ciences of Men, as tho&s;e People &s;ugge&s;t.</P>
<P>It is true he carried Things a great Length un|der the Patriarchal Government of the fir&s;t Ages, but &s;till he was &s;ixteen hundred Years bringing it to pa&s;s; and tho' we have Rea&s;on to believe the old World, before the Flood was arrived to a very great Height of Wickedne&s;s, and <HI>Ovid</HI>

very nobly de&s;cribes it by the War of the <HI>Titans</HI> again&s;t <HI>Jupiter,</HI> yet we do not read that ever Sa|tan was come to &s;uch a Length as to bring them to Idolatry; indeed we do read of Wars car|ried on among them, whether it was one Nati|on again&s;t another, or only Per&s;onal, we cannot tell; But the World &s;eem'd to be &s;wallow'd up in a Life of Wickedne&s;s, that is to &s;ay, of Luxury and Lewdne&s;s, Rapine and Violence, and there were <HI>Giants</HI> among them, and Men of Renown, that is to &s;ay, Men fam'd for their mighty Va|lour, great Actions in War we may &s;uppo&s;e, and their Strength, who per&s;onally oppre&s;s'd others.

<P>Thus far the old Antediluvian World went, and very wicked they were, there is no doubt of that; but we have Rea&s;on to believe there was no Idolatry, the <HI>Devil</HI> had not brought them to that Length yet; perhaps it would &s;oon have follow'd, but the Deluge interven'd.</P>
<P>After the Deluge, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> he had all his Work to do over again, and he went on by the &s;ame Steps; <HI>fir&s;t</HI> he brought them to violence and War, then to Oppre&s;&s;ion and Tyranny, then to neglect of true Wor&s;hip, then to fal&s;e wor&s;hip, and then Idolatry by the meer natural Con&s;e|quence of the Thing; who were the fir&s;t Na|tion or People that fell from the Wor&s;hip of the true God, is &s;omething hard to determine; the <HI>De|vil,</HI> who certainly of all <HI>God</HI>'s Creatures is be&s;t able

particularly &s;et up, as <HI>Baal Peor, Baal Zephon, Baal Phegor,</HI> and in other Places plain <HI>Baal,</HI> as <HI>Jupiter</HI> in after Times had the like Additions; as <HI>Jupiter Ammon, Jupiter Capitolinus, Jupiter Pi&s;|tor, Jupiter Feretrius,</HI> and about ten or twelve <HI>Jupi|ters</HI> more.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge, that I think it was a Ma&s;|ter-piece of Hell to bring the World to Idola|try &s;o &s;oon after they had had &s;uch an eminent Example of the infinite Power of the true God, as was &s;een in the Deluge, and particularly in the E&s;cape of <HI>Noah</HI> in the Ark, to bring them (even before <HI>Noah</HI> or his Sons were dead) to forget who&s;e Hand it was, and give the Homage of the World to a Name, and that a Name of a mortal Man dead and rotten, who was famous for no|thing when he was alive but Blood and War; I &s;ay, to bring the World to &s;et up this Nothing, this meer Name, nay the very Image and Picture of him for <HI>a God,</HI> it was <HI>fir&s;t</HI> a Mark of mo&s;t prodigious Stupidity in the whole Race of Men, a mon&s;trous Degeneracy from Nature, and even from common Sen&s;e; and in the next Place 'twas a token of an inexpre&s;&s;ible Craft and Subtilty in the <HI>Devil,</HI> who had now gotten the People into &s;o full and compleat a Management, that in &s;hort, he could have brought them, by the &s;ame Rule, to have wor&s;hip'd any thing; and in a little while more, did bring many of them to wor&s;hip him&s;elf, <HI>plain Devil as he was,</HI> and knowing him to be &s;uch.</P>
<P>As to the Antiquity of this horrible Defection of Mankind, tho' we do not find the beginning of it particularly recorded, yet we are certain it was not long after the Confu&s;ion of <HI>Babel;</HI> for <HI>Nimrod,</HI> as is &s;aid, was no more than <HI>Noah</HI>'s great Grand&s;on, and <HI>Noah</HI> him&s;elf, I &s;uppo&s;e, might be alive &s;ome Years after <HI>Nimrod</HI> was born; and as <HI>Nimrod</HI> was not long dead, before they forgot that
<PB N="155" REF="163">
he was a Tyrant and a Murtherer, and made a <HI>Baal,</HI> that is a Lord or Idol of him, I &s;ay, he was not long dead, for <HI>Nimrod</HI> was born in the Year of the World 1847, and built <HI>Babylon</HI> the Yeas 1879; and we find <HI>Terah</HI> the Father of <HI>A|bram,</HI> who liv'd from the Year 1879 was an Ido|later, as was doubtle&s;s <HI>Bethuel,</HI> who was <HI>Terah</HI>'s Grand&s;on; for we find <HI>Laban,</HI> who was <HI>Bethuel</HI>'s Son, was &s;o, and all this was during the Life of the fir&s;t Po&s;t-Diluvian Family, for <HI>Terah</HI> was born within one hundred ninety three Years after the Flood, and one hundred fifty &s;even Years before <HI>Noah</HI> was dead; and even <HI>Abram</HI> him&s;elf was eight and fifty Years old before <HI>Noah</HI> died, and yet Idolatry had been then, in all probability, above an hundred Years practi&s;ed in the World.</P>
<P>N. B. It is worth Remark here, what a ter|rible Advantage the Devil gain'd by the de|bauching poor <HI>Noah,</HI> and drawing him into the Sin of Drunkenne&s;s; for by this, as I &s;aid, he &s;ilenc'd and &s;top'd the Mouth of the great Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, that Father and Patriarch of the whole World, who not being able for the Shame of his own foul Mi&s;carriage, to pretend to in&s;truct or reprove the World any more, the <HI>Devil</HI> took hold of them immediately, and for want of a Prophet to warn and admoni&s;h, run that little of Religion which there might be left in <HI>Shem</HI> and <HI>Japhet,</HI> quite out of the World, and delug'd them all in IDOLATRY.</P>
<P>How long the whole World may be &s;aid to be thus overwhelm'd in Ignorance and Idolatry, we may make &s;ome tolerable gue&s;s at by the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Abraham;</HI> for it was not till God call'd him from his Father's Hou&s;e, that any &s;uch Thing as a
<PB N="156" REF="164">
Church was e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the World; nor even then, except in his own Family and Succe&s;&s;ors for al|mo&s;t four hundred Years after that Call; and till God brought the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> back out of <HI>Egypt,</HI> the whole World may be &s;aid to be involv'd in Ido|latry and <HI>Devil</HI> wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>So ab&s;olute a Conque&s;t had the <HI>Devil</HI> made over Mankind immediately after the Flood, and all taking its Ri&s;e and Beginning at the fatal De|feat of <HI>Noah,</HI> who had he liv'd untainted and in|vulnerable, as he had done for &s;ix hundred Years before, would have gone a great way to have &s;tem'd the Torrent of Wickedne&s;s which broke in upon Mankind; and therefore the <HI>Devil,</HI> I &s;ay, was very cunning and very much in the Right of it, take him as he is a meer <HI>Devil,</HI> to attack <HI>Noah</HI> per&s;onally, and give him a Blow &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>It is true, the <HI>Devil</HI> did not immediately ra&s;e out the Notion of Religion and of a GOD from the Minds of Men, nor could he ea&s;ily &s;uppre&s;s the Principle of Wor&s;hip and Homage to be paid to a Sovereign Being, the Author of Nature and Guide of the World; the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;aw this clear|ly in the fir&s;t Ages of the new World, and there|fore, as I have &s;aid, he proceeded politically and by Degrees: That it was &s;o, is evident from the Story of <HI>Job</HI> and his three Friends, who, if we may take it for a Hi&s;tory, not a Fable, and may judge of the Time of it by the Length of <HI>Job</HI>'s Life, and by the Family of <HI>Eliphaz</HI> the <HI>Temanite,</HI> who it is manife&s;t was at lea&s;t Grand&s;on or Great Grand&s;on to <HI>E&s;au I&s;aac</HI>'s elde&s;t Son, and by the Language of <HI>Abimelech</HI> King of <HI>Gerar</HI> to <HI>Abra|ham,</HI> and of <HI>Laban</HI> to <HI>Jacob,</HI> both the Latter being at the &s;ame Time Idolaters; I &s;ay, if we may judge of it by all the&s;e, there were &s;till very &s;ound Notions of Religion in the Minds of Men; nor could Satan with all his Cunning and Policy
<PB N="157" REF="165">
deface tho&s;e <HI>Ideas,</HI> and root them out of the Minds of the People.</P>
<P>And this put him upon taking new Mea&s;ures to keep up his Intere&s;t and pre&s;erve the Hold he got upon Mankind; and his Method was like him&s;elf, &s;ubtle and politick to the la&s;t De|gree, as his whole Hi&s;tory makes appear; for &s;ee|ing he found they could not but believe the Being of a God, and that they would needs wor&s;hip &s;ome|thing, it is evident, he had no Game left him to play but this, namely, to &s;et up wrong Notions of Wor&s;hip, and bring them to a fal&s;e Wor&s;hip in|&s;tead of a True, &s;uppo&s;ing the Object wor&s;hip'd to be &s;till the &s;ame.</P>
<P>To fini&s;h this Stratagem, he fir&s;t in&s;inuates that the true God was a terrible, a dreadful, unap|proachable Being; that to &s;ee him was &s;o fright|ful, that it would be pre&s;ent Death; that to wor|&s;hip him immediately, was a Pre&s;umption which would provoke his Wrath; and that as he was a <HI>con&s;uming Fire</HI> in him&s;elf, &s;o he would burn up tho&s;e in his Anger that dar'd to offer up any Sacrifice to him, but by the Interpo&s;ition of &s;ome Medium which might receive their Adorations in his Name.</P>
<P>Hence it occur'd pre&s;ently, that &s;ubordinate Gods were to be found out and &s;et up, to whom the People might pay the Homage due to the &s;upreme God, and who they might wor&s;hip in his Name; this I take from the mo&s;t antient Ac|count of Idolatry in the World; nor indeed could the Devil him&s;elf find out any other Rea&s;on why Men &s;hould Cannoni&s;e or rather Deify their Princes and Men of Fame, and wor&s;hip them after they were dead, as if they could &s;ave them $Span$ and Calamity, who were not able $Span$ them+&s;elves when they were alive; $Span$ <HI>Satan</HI> bring Men to &s;wallow &s;o $Span$ Thing as the bowing the Knee $Span$

has met with in his Progre&s;s in the World; the fir&s;t I have &s;poken of already.</P>
<P>It is true, Satan very well under&s;tood what was threatn'd to him in the original Promi&s;e to the Woman, immediately after the Fall, namely, <HI>thou &s;halt brui&s;e his Head,</HI> &amp;c. but he did not ex|pect it &s;o &s;uddenly, but thought him&s;elf &s;ure of Mankind, till the Fullne&s;s of Time when the Me&s;&s;iah &s;hould come; and therefore it was a great Surprize to him, to &s;ee that <HI>Abraham</HI> being call'd was &s;o immediately receiv'd and e&s;tabli&s;h'd, tho' he did not &s;o immediately follow the Voice that directed him, yet in him, in his Loins was all God's Church at that Time contain'd.</P>
<P>In the calling <HI>Abraham,</HI> it is ea&s;y to &s;ee that there was no other Way for God to form a Church, that is to &s;ay, to &s;ingle out a People to him&s;elf, as the World was then &s;tated, but by immediate Revolution and Voice from Heaven: All Mankind were gone over to the Enemy, over|whelm'd in Idolatry, in a Word, were engag'd to the <HI>Devil;</HI> God Almighty, or as the Scrip|ture di&s;tingui&s;hes him, <HI>the Lord,</HI> the true GOD, was out of the Que&s;tion; Mankind knew little or nothing of him, much le&s;s did they know any thing of his Wor&s;hip, or that there was &s;uch a Being in the World.</P>
<P>Well might it be &s;aid the <HI>Lord</HI> appeared to <HI>Abraham,</HI> Gen. xii. 7. for if God had not ap|pear'd him&s;elf, he mu&s;t have &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger from Heaven, <HI>and perhaps it was &s;o too,</HI> for he had not one true Servant or Wor&s;hiper that we know of then on Earth, to &s;end on that Errand; no Prophet, no Preacher of Righteou&s;ne&s;s, <HI>Noah</HI> was dead, and had been &s;o above &s;eventeen Year; and if he had not, his preaching, as I ob&s;erved after his great Mi&s;carriage, had but little Effect; we are indeed told, that <HI>Noah</HI> left behind him
<PB N="161" REF="171">
certain Rules and Orders for the true Wor&s;hip of GOD, which were call'd the Precepts of <HI>Noah,</HI> and remain'd in the World for a long Time; tho' how written, when neither any Letters, much le&s;s Writing were known in the World, is a Difficulty which Remains to be &s;olv'd; and this makes me look upon tho&s;e Laws call'd the Pre|cepts of <HI>Noah</HI> to be a modern Invention, as I do al&s;o the <HI>Alphabetum Noachi,</HI> which <HI>Bochart</HI> pretends to give an Account of.</P>
<P>But to leave that Fiction, and come back to <HI>Abraham;</HI> God call'd him, whether at fir&s;t by Voice without any Vi&s;ion, whether in a Dream or Night Vi&s;ion, which was very Significant in tho&s;e Days, or whether by &s;ome aw&s;ul Appearance, we know not; the &s;econd Time, 'tis indeed &s;aid ex|pre&s;sly GOD appeared to him; Be it which Way it will, GOD him&s;elf call'd him, &s;hew'd him the Land of <HI>Canaan,</HI> gave him the Promi&s;e of it for his Po&s;terity, and withal gave him &s;uch a Faith, that the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;oon found there was no room for him to meddle with <HI>Abraham.</HI> This is certain, we do not read that the <HI>Devil</HI> ever &s;o much as attempted <HI>Abraham</HI> at all; &s;ome will &s;ugge&s;t that the Command to <HI>Abraham</HI> to go and offer up his Son <HI>I&s;aac,</HI> was a Temptation of the <HI>Devil,</HI> if po&s;|&s;ible to defeat the glorious Work of GOD's call|ing a holy Seed into the World; for the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> if <HI>Abraham</HI> had di&s;obey'd that Call, the new Fa|vourite had been overcome and made a Rebel of, or <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> if he had <HI>obey'd,</HI> then the promis'd Seed had been cut off, and <HI>Abraham</HI> defeated; but as the Text is expre&s;s that GOD him&s;elf propo&s;ed it to <HI>Abraham,</HI> I &s;hall not &s;tart the Sugge&s;tions of the Criticks, in Bar of the &s;acred Oracle.</P>
<P>Be it one way or other, <HI>Abraham</HI> &s;hew'd a Hero-like Faith and Courage, and if the <HI>Devil</HI> had been the Author of it, he had &s;een him&s;elf
<PB N="162" REF="172">
di&s;appointed in both his Views; (1.) by <HI>Abraham</HI>'s ready and bold Compliance, as believing it to be GOD's Command; and (2.) by the divine Coun|termand of the Execution, ju&s;t as the fatal Knife was lifted up.</P>
<P>But if the <HI>Devil</HI> left <HI>Abraham,</HI> and made no attack upon him, &s;eeing him invulnerable, he made him&s;elf amends upon the other Branch of his Fa|mily, his poor <HI>Nephew</HI> LOT; who, notwith&s;tand|ing he was &s;o immediately under the particular Care of Heaven, as that the Angel who was &s;ent to de&s;troy <HI>Sodom,</HI> could do nothing till he was out of it; and who, tho' after he had left <HI>Zoar,</HI> and was retir'd into a Cave to dwell, yet the &s;ubtle <HI>Devil</HI> found him out, deluded his two Daughters, took an Advantage of the Fright they had been in about <HI>Sodom</HI> and <HI>Gomorrah,</HI> made them be|lieve the whole World was burnt too, as well as tho&s;e Cities, and that in &s;hort, they could never have any <HI>Husbands,</HI> &amp;c. and &s;o in their abundant Concern to repeople the World, and that the Race of Mankind might not be de&s;trov|ed, they go and lie with their own <HI>Father;</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> telling them doubtle&s;s how to do it, by in|toxicating his Head with Wine; in all which Story, whether they were not as drunk as their Father, &s;eems to be a Que&s;tion, or el&s;e they could not have &s;uppo&s;ed all the Men in the Earth were con&s;um'd, when they knew that the little City <HI>Zoar</HI> had been pre&s;erv'd for their Sakes.</P>
<P>This now was the third Conque&s;t <HI>Satan</HI> ob|tain'd by the Gu&s;t of humane Appetite; that is to &s;ay, once by Eating and twice by Drinking, or Drunkenne&s;s, and &s;till the la&s;t was the wor&s;t and mo&s;t &s;hameful; for <HI>Lot,</HI> however his Daughters manag'd him, could not pretend he did not un|der&s;tand what the Strength of Wine was; and one would have thought after &s;o terrible a Judg|ment
<PB N="163" REF="173">
as that of <HI>Sodom</HI> was, which was, as we may &s;ay, executed before his Face, his Thoughts &s;hould have been too &s;olemnly engag'd in prai&s;|ing God for &s;paring his Life, to be made drunk, and that two Nights together.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Devil</HI> play'd his Game &s;ure, he &s;et his two Daughters to work, and as the <HI>Devil</HI>'s In|&s;truments &s;eldom fail, &s;o he &s;ecur'd his by that helli&s;h Stratagem of deluding the Daughters, to think all the World was con&s;um'd but they two and their Father: To be &s;ure the old Man could not &s;u&s;pect that his Daughters De&s;ign was &s;o wicked as indeed it was, or that they intended to debauch him with Wine, and make him drink till he knew not what he did.</P>
<P>Now the <HI>Devil</HI> having carried his Game here, gain'd a great Point; for as there were but two re|ligious Families in the World before, from whence a twofold Generation might be &s;uppo&s;ed to ri&s;e religious and righteous like there Parents, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that of <HI>Abraham</HI> and this of <HI>Lot;</HI> this Crime ruin'd the Hopes of one of them; it could no more be &s;aid that ju&s;t <HI>Lot</HI> was in Being, who vex'd his <HI>righteous Soul</HI> from Day to Day with the wicked Behaviour of the People of <HI>Sodom;</HI> righteous <HI>Lot</HI> was degenerated into drunken in|ce&s;tuous <HI>Lot,</HI> LOT fallen from what he was, to be a wicked and unrighteous Man; no pattern of Virtue, no Reprover of the Age, but a poor fal|len Degenerate Patriarch, who could now no more reprove or exhort, but look down and be a&s;ham'd, and had nothing to do but to repent; and &s;ee the poor mean Excu&s;es of all the three.</P>

<HI>Noah</HI> only to pitch upon, and he quickly conquer'd him by the In&s;tigation of his <HI>Grand&s;on.</HI></P>
<P>At the Building of <HI>Babel</HI> he guided them by their acting all in a Body as one Man; &s;o that in &s;hort he manag'd them with ea&s;e, taking them as a Body politic; and we find they came into his Snare as one Man; but Now, the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> multi|plying in the Land of their Bondage, and God &s;eem|ing to &s;hew a particular Concern for them, the <HI>Devil</HI> was oblig'd to new Mea&s;ures, &s;tand at a Di&s;tance, and look on for &s;ome Time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Egyptians</HI> were plagued even without his Help, nor tho' the cunning Arti&s;t, as I &s;aid, &s;tood and looked on, yet he dur&s;t not meddle; nor could he make a few Lice, the lea&s;t and meane&s;t of the Armies of In&s;ects rai&s;ed to afflict the <HI>Egyptiaus.</HI></P>
<P>However, when he perceiv'd that God re&s;olv|ed to bring the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> out, he prepar'd to at|tend them, to watch them, and be at Hand up|on all the wicked Occa&s;ions that might offer, as if he had been fully &s;atisfied &s;uch Occa&s;ions would offer, and that he &s;hould not fail to have an Op|portunity to draw them into &s;ome Snare or another, and that therefore it was his Bu&s;ine&s;s not to be out of the Way, but to be ready (as we &s;ay) to make his Market of them in the be&s;t Manner he could: How many Ways he attempted them, nay, how many Times he conquer'd them in their Journey, we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t he put them in a fright at <HI>Baal-Zephon,</HI> where he thought he had drawn them into a Noo&s;e, and where he &s;ent <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his Army to block them up between the Mountains of <HI>Piahiroth</HI> and the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> but there indeed <HI>Satan</HI> was outwitted by <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> &s;o far as it appeared to be a humane Action, for he little thought of their going dry footed <HI>thro' the Sea,</HI> but depended up|on having them all cut in Pieces the next Morn|ing
<PB N="167" REF="177">
by the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> an eminent Proof, <HI>by the Way,</HI> that the <HI>Devil</HI> has <HI>no Knowledge of Events,</HI> or any In&s;ight into Futurity; nay, that he has not &s;o much as a &s;econd Sight, or knows to Day what his Maker intends to do to Morrow; for had <HI>Satan</HI> known that God intended to Ford them over the Sea, if he had not been able to have prevent|ted the Miracle, he would certainly have preven|ted the E&s;cape, by &s;ending out <HI>Pharoah</HI> and his Army time enough to have taken the Strand be|fore them, and &s;o have driven them to the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of travelling on Foot round the North Point of that Sea, by the Wilderne&s;s of <HI>Etan,</HI> where he would have pur&s;u'd and harra&s;s'd them with his Cavalry, and in all Probability have de&s;troy'd them: But the blind &s;hort-&s;ighted Devil, perfectly in the Dark, and unacquainted with Futurity, knew no|thing of the Matter, was as much deceiv'd as <HI>Pharoah</HI> him&s;elf, &s;tood &s;till flattering him&s;elf with the Hopes of his Booty, and the Revenge he &s;hould take upon them the next Morning; till he &s;aw the frighted Waves in an Uproar, and to his utter A&s;toni&s;hment and Confu&s;ion &s;aw the Pa&s;|&s;age laid open, and <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> leading his va&s;t Army in full March over the dry Space; nay even then 'tis very propable Satan did not know that if the <HI>Egyptians</HI> follow'd them, the Sea would return upon and overwhelm them; for I can hardly think &s;o hard of the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, that if he had, he would have &s;uffer'd much le&s;s prompted <HI>Pha|roah</HI> to follow the Cha&s;e at &s;uch an Expence; &s;o that either he mu&s;t be an ignorant unfore&s;eeing Devil, or a very ungrateful fal&s;e <HI>Devil</HI> to his Friends the <HI>Egyptians.</HI></P>
<P>I am enclin'd al&s;o to the more charitable Opini|on of Satan too, becau&s;e the E&s;cape of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> was really a Triumph over him&s;elf; for the War was certainly his, or at lea&s;t he was auxiliary to <HI>Pharoah,</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="178">
it was a Victory over <HI>Hell</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> toge|ther, and he would never have &s;uffer'd the Di&s;|grace, if he had known it beforehand; that is to &s;ay, tho' he could not have prevented the E|&s;cape of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> or the dividing the Water, yet he might have warn'd the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and caution|ed them not to venture in after them.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall &s;ee a great many weak Steps taken by the Devil in the Affair of this very Peo|ple and their forty Years Wandring in the Wil|derne&s;s; and tho' he was in &s;ome things &s;ucce&s;s|ful, and wheedled them into many fooli&s;h and mi&s;erable Murmurings and Wranglings again&s;t God, and Mutinies again&s;t poor <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> yet the <HI>Devil</HI> was oftentimes baulk'd and di&s;appointed; and 'tis for this Rea&s;on that I choo&s;e to fini&s;h the fir&s;t Part of his Hi&s;tory with the particular Relation of his Behaviour among the Jews, becau&s;e al&s;o, we do not find any extraordinary Things happen|ing any where el&s;e in the World for above one thou&s;and five hundred Years, no Variety, no Re|volutions; all the Re&s;t of Mankind lay &s;till under his Yoke, quietly &s;ubmitted to his Government, did ju&s;t as he bad them, wor&s;hip'd every Idol he &s;et up, and in a Word, he had no Difficulty with any Body but the <HI>Jews,</HI> and for this Rea&s;on, I &s;ay, this Part of his Story will be the more u&s;e|ful and in&s;tructing.</P>

But when he had Day-Light for it, and view'd the next Day's Work, I make no Que&s;tion but <HI>all Hell felt the Surpri&s;e,</HI> the Prey being thus &s;natch'd out of their Hands unexpectedly. 'Tis true the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Ho&s;t was &s;ent to him in their Room, but that was not what he aim'd at; for he was &s;ure enough of them his own Way, and if it was not <HI>ju&s;t at that Time,</HI> yet he knew what and who they were; but as he had devour'd the whole <HI>I&s;raeli|ti&s;h</HI> Ho&s;t in his Imagination, to the Tune of at lea&s;t a Million and a half of Souls; Men, Wo|men and Children; it was, no doubt, a great Di&s;|appointment to the Devil to mi&s;s of his Prey, and to &s;ee them all triumphing on the other Side in Safety.</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Satan</HI>'s Annals do not mention this Defeat, for Hi&s;torians are generally backward to regi&s;ter their own Misfortunes; but as we have an Account of the Fact from other Hands, &s;o as we cannot que&s;tion the Truth of it; the Na|ture of the Thing will tell us it was a Di&s;appoint|ment to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and a very great one too.</P>
<P>I cannot but ob&s;erve here, that I think this Part of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Story very entertaining, be|cau&s;e of the great Variety of Incidents which ap|pear in every Part of it; &s;ometimes he is like a hunted Fox, curvetting and counter-running to avoid his being pur&s;ued and found out, while at the &s;ame time he is carrying on his &s;ecret De&s;igns to draw the People he pretends to manage, into &s;ome Snare or other to their Hurt; at another time, tho' the Compari&s;on is a little too low for his Dignity, like a Monkey that has done Mi&s;|chief, and who making his own E&s;cape &s;its and chatters at a Di&s;tance, as if he had triumph'd in what he had done; &s;o Satan, when he had drawn them in to wor&s;hip a Calf, to offer &s;trange Fire, to &s;et up a Schi&s;m, and the like; and &s;o to bring the Divine Vengeance upon them&s;elves, leaving

them in their Di&s;tre&s;s, kept at a Di&s;tance, as if he look'd on with Satisfaction to &s;ee them Burnt, &s;wallow'd up, &s;wept away, and the like; as the &s;everal Stories relate.</P>
<P>His indefatigable Vigilance is, on the other hand, a u&s;eful Caveat, as well as an improving View to us; no &s;ooner is he routed and expos'd, defeated and di&s;appointed in one Enterprize, but he begins another, and, like a cunning Gladiator, warily defends him&s;elf, and boldly attacks his Ene|my at the &s;ame time. Thus we &s;ee him, up and down, conquering and conquered, thro' this whole Part of his Story, till at la&s;t he receives a total De|feat; of which you &s;hall hear in its place: In the mean time, let us take up his Story again at the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> where he receiv'd a great Blow, in&s;tead of which he expected a compleat Victory; for doubtle&s;s the Devil and the King of <HI>Aegypt</HI> too, thought of nothing but Conque&s;t at <HI>Piahiroth.</HI></P>
<P>However, tho' the Triumph of the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> over the <HI>Egyptians</HI> mu&s;t needs be a great Morti|fication to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and exa&s;perated him very much, yet the Con&s;equence was only this, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Satan,</HI> like an Enemy who is baulk'd and defeated, but not overcome, redoubles his Rage, and reinforces his Army, and what the <HI>Egyptians</HI> could not do for him, he re&s;olves to do for him|&s;elf; in order then to take his Opportunity for what Mi&s;chief might offer, being defeated, and provok'd, I &s;ay, at the Slur that was put upon him, he re&s;olves to follow them into the Wilderne&s;s, and many a vile Prank he plaid them there; as fir&s;t, he &s;traitens them for Water, and makes them murmur again&s;t GOD, and again&s;t <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> within a very few Days, nay, Hours, of their great Deliverance of all.</P>
<P>Nor was this all, but in le&s;s than one Year more we find them, (at his In&s;tigation too) &s;etting up

a <HI>golden Calf,</HI> and making all the People dance about it at Mount <HI>Sinai;</HI> even when God him&s;el had but ju&s;t before appear'd to them in the Ter|rors of a burning Fire upon the Top of the Mountain; <HI>and what was the Pretence?</HI> Truly, nothing but that they had lo&s;t <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> who u&s;ed to be their Guide, and he had hid him&s;elf in the Mount, and had not been &s;een in forty Days, &s;o that they could not tell what was become of him. This put them all into Confu&s;ion; a poor Pre|tence indeed, to turn them all back to Idolatry! but the <HI>watchful Devil</HI> took the Hint, pu&s;h'd the Advantage, and in&s;inuated that they &s;hould never &s;ee <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> again, that he was certainly devour'd by venturing too near the Fla&s;hes of Fire in the Mount, and pre&s;uming upon the Liberty he had taken before; in a word, that God had de&s;troyed <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> or he was &s;tarved to Death for want of Food, having been forty Days and forty Nights ab&s;ent.</P>
<P>All the&s;e were, it's true, in them&s;elves mo&s;t fooli&s;h Sugge&s;tions, con&s;idering <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> was ad|mitted to the Vi&s;ion of God, and that God had been plea&s;ed to appear to him in the mo&s;t inti|mate manner; that as they might depend God would not de&s;troy his faithful Servant, &s;o they might have concluded he was able to &s;upport his Being without Food as long as he thought fit; but to a People &s;o ea&s;y to believe any thing, what could be too gro&s;s for the <HI>Devil</HI> to per&s;uade them to?</P>
<P>A People who could dance round a Calf, and call it their God, might do any thing; that could &s;ay to one another, that this was the Great JE|HOVAH, <HI>that brought them out of the Land of E|gypt;</HI> and that within &s;o few Days after God's miraculous Appearance to them, and for them; I &s;ay, &s;uch a People were really fitted to be im|po&s;ed

<P>This was indeed his fir&s;t con&s;iderable Experi|ment upon them as <HI>a People,</HI> or as <HI>a Body;</HI> and the Truth is, his Affairs requir'd it, for <HI>Satan,</HI> who has been a &s;ucce&s;sful Devil in mo&s;t of his Attempts upon Mankind, could hardly doubt of Succe&s;s in any thing after he had carried his Point at Mount <HI>Sinai:</HI> To bring them to Idolatry in the very Face of their Deliverer, and ju&s;t after their Deliverance! It was more a&s;toni&s;hing in the main than even their pa&s;&s;ing <HI>the Red Sea:</HI> In a Word, the <HI>Devil</HI>'s whole Hi&s;tory does not furni&s;h us with a Story equally &s;urpri&s;ing.</P>
<P>And how was poor <HI>Aaron</HI> bewilder'd in it too? He that was <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Partner in all the great Things that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> did in <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Sight, and that was appointed to be his A&s;&s;i&s;tant and Oracle, <HI>or Ora|tor rather,</HI> upon all public Occa&s;ions; that he, above all the re&s;t, &s;hould come into this ab&s;urd and ridiculous Propo&s;al, he that was &s;ingled out for the &s;acred Prie&s;thood, for him to defile his holy Hands with a polluted abominable Sacrifice, and with making the Idol for them too, (for 'tis plain that he made it,) how mon&s;trous was it!</P>
<P>And &s;ee what an An&s;wer he gives to his Bro|ther <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> how weak! how &s;imple! <HI>I did &s;o and &s;o, indeed,</HI> I bad them bring the Ear-rings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and I ca&s;t the Gold into the Fire, and <HI>it came out this Calf.</HI> Ridiculous! as if the Calf came out by meer fortuitous Adventure, without a Mould to ca&s;t it in; which could not be &s;uppo&s;ed: And if it had not come out &s;o without a Mould, <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> would certainly have known of it; had <HI>Aaron</HI> been innocent, he would have an&s;wered after quite another manner, and told <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> hone&s;tly that the whole Body of the People came to him in a Fright, that they forced him to make them
<PB N="173" REF="183">
an Idol; which he did, by making fir&s;t a pro|per Mould to ca&s;t it in, and then taking the pro|per Metal to ca&s;t it from: That indeed he had &s;inn'd in &s;o doing, but that he was Mobb'd into it, and the People terrify'd him, perhaps they threatned to kill him; and if he had added, that the <HI>Devil</HI> prompting his Fear beguil'd him, he had &s;aid nothing but what was certainly true; for if it was in Satan's Power to make the People in|&s;olent and outrageous enough to threaten and bully the old venerable Prophet <HI>(for he was not yet a Prie&s;t)</HI> who was the Brother of their Oracle <HI>Mo|&s;es,</HI> and had been Partner with him in &s;o many of his Commi&s;&s;ions; I &s;ay, if he cou'd bring up the Pa&s;&s;ions of the People to a Height to be rude and unmannerly to him <HI>(Aaron),</HI> and perhaps to threa|ten and in&s;ult him, he may be ea&s;ily &s;uppos'd to be able to intimidate <HI>Aaron,</HI> and terrify him into a Compliance.</P>
<P>See this cunning Agent, when he has Man's De&s;truction in his View, how &s;ecurely he acts! he never wants a handle; the be&s;t of Men have one weak place or other, and he always finds it out, takes the Advantage of it, and conquers them by one Artifice or another; only take it with you as you go, 'tis always <HI>by Stratagem,</HI> never <HI>by Force;</HI> a Proof that he is not empower'd to u&s;e Violence: He may Tempt, and he does prevail; but 'tis all <HI>Legerdemain,</HI> 'tis all Cra&s;t and Artifice, he is &s;till <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the <HI>Calumniator</HI> and Deceiver, that is, the Mi&s;repre&s;enter; he mi&s;re|pre&s;ents <HI>Man</HI> to GOD, and mi&s;repre&s;ents GOD to <HI>Man;</HI> al&s;o he mi&s;repre&s;ents Things; he puts fal&s;e Colours, and then mannages the Eye to &s;ee them with an imperfect View, rai&s;ing Clouds and Fogs to intercept our Sight; in &s;hort, he deceives all our Sen&s;es, and impo&s;es upon us in Things which otherwi&s;e would be the ea&s;ie&s;t to di&s;cern and judge of.</P>

This indeed is in part the Benefit of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, to let us &s;ee that he has u&s;ed the &s;ame Me|thod all along; and that ever &s;ince he has had any thing to do with Mankind, he has practis'd upon them with Stratagem and Cunning; al&s;o 'tis ob&s;ervable that he has carried his Point bet|ter that way than he would have done by Fury and Violence, if he had been allowed to make u&s;e of it; for by his Power indeed he might have laid the World de&s;olate, and made a Heap of Rubbi&s;h of it long ago; but, as I have ob&s;erv'd before, that would not have an&s;wered his Ends half &s;o well, for by de&s;troying Men he would have made Martyrs, and &s;ent abundance of good Men to Heaven, who would much rather have died, than yielded to &s;erve him, and, as he aim|ed to have it, to fall down and wor&s;hip him; I &s;ay, he would have made Martyrs, and that not a few: But this was none of <HI>Satan</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s; his De&s;ign lies quite another Way; his Bu&s;ine&s;s is to make Men <HI>&s;in,</HI> not to make them <HI>&s;uffer;</HI> to make <HI>Devils</HI> of them, not <HI>Saints;</HI> to delude them, and draw them away from their Maker, not &s;end them away to him; and therefore he works by Stratagem, not by Force.</P>
<P>We are now come to his Story, as it relates to the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church in the Wilderne&s;s, and to the Children of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> in their travelling Circum&s;tan|ces; and this was the fir&s;t Scene of public Ma|nagement that the Devil had upon his Hands in the World; for, as I have &s;aid, <HI>till now,</HI> he dealt with Mankind either in their &s;eparate Condition, one by one, or el&s;e carried all before him, engro&s;|&s;ing whole Nations in his Sy&s;tems of Idolatry, and overwhelming them in an ignorant De&s;truction.</P>

View of a Kingdom being &s;et up independent of him, and &s;uperior to his Authority, it is not to be wondred at if he endeavour'd to overthrow them in the Infancy of their Con&s;titution, and tried all po&s;&s;ible Arts to bring them back into his own Hands again.</P>
<P>He found them not only carried away from the Country where they were even in his Clutches, &s;urrounded with Idols, and where we have Rea|&s;on to believe the greate&s;t part of them were pol|luted with the Idolatry of the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> for we do not read of any &s;tated Wor&s;hip which they had of their own, or if they did wor&s;hip the true God, we &s;carce know in what manner they did it; they had no Law given them, nothing but the Covenant of Circumci&s;ion, and even <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI> him&s;elf had not &s;trictly ob&s;erv'd that, till he was frighted into it; we read of no Sacrifices among them, no Fea&s;ts were ordain'd, no &s;olemn Wor|&s;hip appointed, and how, or in what manner they perform'd their Homage, we know not; the Pa&s;|&s;over was not ordain'd till ju&s;t at their coming a|way; &s;o that there was not much Religion among them, at lea&s;t that we have any Account of; and we may &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> was pretty ea&s;y with them all the while they were in the Hou&s;e of their Bondage.</P>
<P>But now, to have a Million of People fetch'd out of his Hands, as it were all at once, and to have the immediate Power of Heaven engaged in it, and that <HI>Satan</HI> &s;aw evidently God had &s;in|gled them out in a miraculous Manner to favour them, and call them <HI>his own;</HI> this allarm'd him at once, and therefore he re&s;olves to follow them, lay clo&s;e Siege to them, and take all the Mea&s;ures po&s;&s;ible to bring them to rebel again&s;t, and di&s;|obey GOD, that he might be provok'd to de&s;troy them; and how near he went to bring it to pa&s;s, we &s;hall &s;ec pre&s;ently.</P>

This making a Calf, and paying an idolatrous Wor&s;hip to it, (for they acted the Heathens and Idolaters, not in the &s;etting up the Calf only, but in the Manner of their Wor&s;hiping, <HI>viz. Dancing</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;ick,</HI> Things they had not been acquainted with in the Wor&s;hip of the true God) I mention here, to ob&s;erve how the Devil not only impo&s;ed upon their Principles, but upon their Sen&s;es too; as if the awful Maje&s;ty of Hea|ven, who&s;e Glory they had &s;een in Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> where they &s;tood, and who&s;e Pillar of Cloud and Fire was their Guide and Protection, would be wor&s;hip'd by dancing round a Calf! and that not a living Creature, or a real Calf, but the mere Image of a <HI>Calf</HI> ca&s;t in Gold, or, as &s;ome think, in Bra&s;s gilded over.</P>
<P>But this was the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Way with Mankind, namely, to impo&s;e upon their Sen&s;es, and bring them into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Follies and Ab&s;urdities; and then, having fir&s;t made them Fools, it was much the ea&s;ier to make them Offenders.</P>
<P>In this very Manner he acted with them thro' all the Cour&s;e of their Wilderne&s;s Travels; for as they were led by the Hand like Children, de|fended by Omnipotence, fed by Miracles, in|&s;tructed immediately from Heaven, and in all things had <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> for their Guide; they had no room to mi&s;carry, but by acting the greate&s;t Ab|&s;urdities, and committing the greate&s;t Follies in Nature; and even the&s;e, the <HI>Devil</HI> brought them to be guilty of, in a &s;urpri&s;ing manner: 1. As GOD him&s;elf reliev'd them in every Exigence, and &s;upply'd them in every Want, one would think 'twas impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be ever brought to que&s;tion either his Willingne&s;s or his Ability, and yet they really objected again&s;t both; which was indeed very provoking, and I doubt not, that when the <HI>Devil</HI> had brought them to act
<PB N="177" REF="187">
in &s;uch a prepo&s;terous Manner, he really hoped and believed God would be provok'd effectually: The Te&s;timonies of his Care of them, and Abi|lity to &s;upply them, were miraculous and unde|niable; he gave them Water from the Rock, Bread from the Air, &s;ent the Fowls to feed them with Fle&s;h, and &s;upported them all the Way by Miracles; their Health was pre&s;erv'd, none were &s;ick among them, their Clothes did not wear out, nor their Shoes grow old upon their Feet; could any thing be more ab&s;urd, than to doubt whether he could provide for them who had ne|ver let them want for &s;o many Years?</P>
<P>But the <HI>Devil</HI> managed them in &s;pight of Mi|racle; nor did he ever give them over till he had brought &s;ix hundred thou&s;and of them to pro|voke God &s;o highly that he would not &s;uffer a|bove two of them to go into the Land of Pro|mi&s;e; &s;o that in &s;hort, Satan gained his Point as to that Generation, for all their Carca&s;&s;es fell in the Wilderne&s;s. Let us take but a &s;hort View to what a Height he brought 'em, and in what a rude, ab&s;urd Manner they acted; how he &s;et them upon murmuring upon every Occa&s;ion, now for Water, then for Bread; nay, they mur|mured <HI>at their Bread</HI> when they had it; <HI>Our Soul loaths this light Bread.</HI></P>
<P>He &s;ow'd the Seeds of Church-Rebellion in the Sons of <HI>Aaron,</HI> and made <HI>Nadab</HI> and <HI>Abihu</HI> offer &s;trange Fire till they were &s;trangely con|&s;umed by Fire for the doing it.</P>

<P>But to look a little back upon this Part (for it cannot be omitted, it makes &s;o con&s;iderable a Part of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Hi&s;tory) I mean his drawing God's People, Kings and all, into all the Sins and Mi&s;chiefs which gradually contributed to their De&s;truction.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>(for he began immediately with the very be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t of the Race)</HI> he drew in King <HI>So|lomon,</HI> in the mid&s;t of all his Zeal for the build|ing God's Hou&s;e, and for the making the mo&s;t glorious and magnificent Appearance for God's Wor&s;hip that ever the World &s;aw; I &s;ay, in the middle of all this, he drew him into &s;uch im|moderate and in&s;atiable an Appetite for Women, as to &s;et up the fir&s;t, and perhaps the greate&s;t <HI>Se|raglio</HI> of Whores that ever any Prince in the World had, or pretended to before; nay, and to bring whoring &s;o much into Reputation, that, as the Text &s;ays, &s;even hundred of them were Prince&s;&s;es; that is to &s;ay, Ladies of Quality: Not as the Grand Seigniors, and Great Moguls, (other Princes of the Ea&s;tern World) have &s;ince practi&s;ed, namely, to pick up their mo&s;t beauti|ful Slaves; but the&s;e, it &s;eems, were Women of Rank, King's Daughters, as <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Daughter, and the Daughters of the Princes and prime Men among the <HI>Moabites, Ammenites, Zidonians, Hit|tites,</HI> &amp;c. 1 <HI>Kings</HI> xi. 1.</P>
<P>Nor was this all; but as he drew him in to the Love of the&s;e forbidden Women <HI>(for &s;uch they $$re, as to their Nation, as well as Number)</HI> &s;o he
<PB N="184" REF="194">
en&s;nar'd him by tho&s;e Women to a Familiarity with their Wor&s;hip; and by degrees brought that famous Prince (famous for his Wi&s;dom) to be the greate&s;t and mo&s;t-impos'd-upon old Fool in the World; Bowing down to tho&s;e Idols by the In|ticings of his Whores, whom he had abhor'd and dete&s;ted in his Youth, as di&s;honouring that God for whom, and for who&s;e Wor&s;hip he had fini&s;h'd and dedicated the mo&s;t magnificent Building and Temple in the World: Nothing but the invinci|ble Subtlety of this <HI>Arch Devil</HI> could ever have brought &s;uch a Man as <HI>Solomon</HI> to &s;uch a Dege|neracy of Manners, and to &s;uch Meanne&s;&s;es; no, not the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Whores, nor the Whores them&s;elves, without the <HI>Devil</HI> to help them.</P>
<P>As to <HI>Solomon, Satan</HI> had made Conque&s;t enough there, we need hear no more of him; the next Advance he made, was in the Per&s;on of his Son <HI>Rehoboam;</HI> had not the <HI>Devil</HI> prompted his Pride and tyrannical Humour, he would never have given the People &s;uch an An&s;wer as he did; and when he &s;aw a Fellow at the Head of them too whom he knew wanted and waited for an Occa&s;ion to rai&s;e a Rebellion, and had ripened up the Peo|ples Humour to the Occa&s;ion: Well might the Text call it <HI>li&s;tening to the Council of the young Heads;</HI> that it was indeed with a Vengeance! but tho&s;e young Heads too were acted by an old <HI>De|vil,</HI> who for his Craft is called, as I have ob&s;erv'd, the <HI>Old Serpent.</HI></P>
<P>Having thus pay'd the Way, <HI>Jeroboam</HI> revolts. So far God had directed him; for the Text &s;ays expre&s;ly, &s;peaking in the fir&s;t Per&s;on of GOD him&s;elf, <HI>This Thing is of Me.</HI></P>
<P>But tho' GOD might appoint <HI>Jeroboam</HI> to be King, (that is to &s;ay, of ten Tribes,) yet GOD did not appoint him to &s;et up the <HI>two Calves</HI> in
<PB N="185" REF="195">
the two extreme Parts of the Land, <HI>viz.</HI> in <HI>Dan,</HI> and in <HI>Bethel;</HI> that was <HI>Jeroboam</HI>'s own doing, and done on purpo&s;e to keep the People from falling back to <HI>Rehoboam,</HI> by being obliged to go to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to the publick Wor&s;hip: And the Text adds, <HI>Jeroboam made I&s;rael to &s;in.</HI> This was indeed a Ma&s;ter-Piece of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Policy, and it was effectual to an&s;wer the End, nothing could have been more to the Purpo&s;e; what Rea&s;on he had to expect the People would &s;o univer&s;ally come into it, and be &s;o well &s;atisfied with a couple of Calves, in&s;tead of the true Wor&s;hip of GOD at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> or what Arts and Management he <HI>(Satan)</HI> made u&s;e of afterwards, to bring the People in, to join with &s;uch a Delu&s;ion, that we find but little of in all the Annals of <HI>Satan;</HI> nor is it much to the Ca&s;e: 'Tis certain the <HI>Devil</HI> found a &s;trange kind of Propen&s;ity to wor&s;hip|ing Idols rooted in the Temper of that whole People, even from their fir&s;t breaking away from the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Bondage; &s;o that he had nothing to do but to work upon the old Stock, and propa|gate the Crime that he found was &s;o natural to them. And this is <HI>Satan</HI>'s general Way of work|ing, not with them only, but with us al&s;o, and with all the World, even then, and ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>When he had thus &s;ecur'd <HI>Jeroboam</HI>'s Revolt, we need not trace him among his Succe&s;&s;ors; for the &s;ame Rea&s;on of State that held for the &s;etting up the Calves at <HI>Bethel</HI> and <HI>Dan,</HI> held good for the keeping them up, to all <HI>Jeroboam</HI>'s Po&s;terity; nor had they one good King ever after; even <HI>Jehu,</HI> who call'd his Friends to come and &s;ee his <HI>Zeal for the Lord,</HI> and who fulfill'd the Threat|nings of God upon <HI>Ahab</HI> and his Family, and up|on Queen <HI>Jezabel</HI> and her Offspring, and knew all the while that he was executing the Judgment of the True God upon an Idolatrous Race; yet
<PB N="186" REF="196">
he would not Part with his Calves, but would have thought it to have been parting with his Kingdom, and that as the People would have gone up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to wor&s;hip, &s;o they would at the &s;ame Time have transfer'd their civil Obe|dience to the King of <HI>Judah,</HI> (who&s;e Right it really was, as far as they could claim by Birth and right Line); &s;o that by the Way, <HI>Satan</HI> any more than other Politicians, is not for the <HI>jus divinum</HI> of lineal Succe&s;&s;ion, or what we call Hereditary Right, any farther than &s;erves for his Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus Satan ridded his Hands of ten of the twelve Tribes; let us now &s;ee how he went on with the Re&s;t, for his Work was now brought into a narrower Compa&s;s; the Church of God was now reduc'd to two Tribes, except a few re|ligious People, who &s;eparated from the Schi&s;m of <HI>Jeroboam,</HI> and came and planted them&s;elves among the Tribes of <HI>Judah</HI> and <HI>Benjamin:</HI> The fir&s;t Thing the Devil did after this, was to Foment a War between the two Kings, while <HI>Judah</HI> was govern|ed by a Boy or Youth, <HI>Abija</HI> by Name, and he none of the be&s;t neither; but God's Time was not come, and the Devil receiv'd a great Di&s;ap|pointment; when <HI>Jeroboam</HI> was &s;o entirely over|thrown; that if the Records of tho&s;e Ages do not mi&s;take, no le&s;s than 500000 Men of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were kill'd, &s;uch a Slaughter, that one would think the Army of <HI>Judah,</HI> had they known how to improve as well as gain a Victory, might have brought all the Re&s;t back again, and have intirely reduc'd the Hou&s;e of <HI>Jeroboam</HI> and the ten Tribes that follow'd him to their Obedience; nay they did take a great deal of the Country from them, and among the Re&s;t <HI>Bethel</HI> it &s;elf; and yet &s;o cunningly did <HI>Satan</HI> manage, that the King of <HI>Judah,</HI> who was him&s;elf a wicked King, and perhaps an Ido|later in his Heart, did not take down the Golden
<PB N="187" REF="197">
Calf that <HI>Jeroboam</HI> had there, no nor de&s;troy the Idolatry it &s;elf, &s;o that in &s;hort, his Victory &s;igni|fied nothing.</P>
<P>From hence to the Captivity, we find the <HI>De|vil</HI> bu&s;y with the Kings of <HI>Judah,</HI> e&s;pecially the be&s;t of them; as for &s;uch as <HI>Mana&s;&s;eh</HI> and tho&s;e who tran&s;gre&s;s'd by the general Tenor of their Lives, tho&s;e he had no great trouble with.</P>
<P>But &s;uch as <HI>A&s;a, Jeho&s;haphat, Hezekiah,</HI> and <HI>Jo|&s;iah,</HI> he hung about them and their Courts, till he brought every one of them into &s;ome Mi&s;chief or another.</P>
<P>As fir&s;t, good King <HI>A&s;a,</HI> of whom the Scrip|ture &s;ays, his Heart was perfect all his Days, yet this &s;ubtle Spirit, that could break in upon him no where el&s;e, tempted him when the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> came out again&s;t him, to &s;end to hire <HI>Benhadad</HI> the King of <HI>Syria</HI> to help him; as if God who had before enabled him to conquer the <HI>Ethiopi|ans,</HI> with an Army of ten hundred thou&s;and Men, could not have &s;aved him from the King of the ten Tribes.</P>
<P>In the &s;ame Manner he tempted <HI>Jeho&s;haphat</HI> to join with that wicked King <HI>Ahab</HI> again&s;t the King of <HI>Syria,</HI> and al&s;o to marry his Son to <HI>Ahab</HI>'s Daughter, which was fatal to <HI>Jeho&s;haphat,</HI> and to his Po&s;terity.</P>
<P><HI>Again,</HI> He tempted <HI>Hezekiah</HI> to &s;hew all his Riches to the King of <HI>Babylon</HI>'s Me&s;&s;engers; and who can doubt, but that he <HI>(Satan)</HI> is to be un|der&s;tood by the wicked Spirit which &s;tood before the Lord, 2. <HI>Chron.</HI> xviii. 20. and offered his Service to entice <HI>Ahab</HI> the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> to come out to Battle to his Ruin, by being a lying Spi|rit in the Mouths of all his Prophets; and who for that Time had a&s;pecial Commi&s;&s;ion, as he had another Time in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Job?</HI> and indeed it was a Commi&s;&s;ion &s;it for no body but the <HI>Devil: Thou</HI>

<P>From the Death of this good King, the <HI>Devil</HI> prevail'd &s;o with the whole Nation of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and brought them to &s;uch an incorrigible Pitch of Wickedne&s;s, that <HI>God</HI> gave them up, for|&s;ook his Habitation of Glory, the Temple, which he &s;uffer'd to be &s;poil'd fir&s;t, then burnt and de|moli&s;h'd; de&s;troying the whole Nation of the <HI>Jews,</HI> except a &s;mall Number that were left, and tho&s;e the Enemy carried away into Captivity.</P>

<P>We come therefore to the Re&s;toration or Re|turn of the Captivity: Had <HI>Satan</HI> been able to have acted any thing by Force, <HI>as I have ob&s;erv'd before,</HI> all the Princes and Powers of the World, having been, as they really were at his Devotion,
<PB N="190" REF="200">
he might ea&s;ily have made u&s;e of them, arm'd all the World again&s;t the <HI>Jews,</HI> and prevented the Rebuilding the Temple, and even the Re|turn of the Captivity.</P>
<P>But now the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Power manife&s;tly receiv|ed a Check, and the Hand of God appear'd in it, and that he was re&s;olv'd to ree&s;tabli&s;h his People the <HI>Jews,</HI> and to have a &s;econd Temple built: the <HI>Devil,</HI> who knew the Extent of his own Power too well, and what Limitations were laid upon him, &s;tood &s;till as it were looking on, and not daring to oppo&s;e the Return of the Capti|vity, which he very well knew had been prophe|&s;ied, and would come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>He did indeed make &s;ome little Oppo&s;ition to the Building, and to the fortifying the City, but as it was to no Purpo&s;e, &s;o he was &s;oon oblig'd to give it over; and thus the Captivity being re|turn'd, and the Temple rebuilt, the People of the <HI>Jews</HI> encrea&s;ed and multiplied to an infinite Num|ber and Strength; and from this Time we may &s;ay, the Power of the <HI>Devil</HI> rather declin'd and decreas'd, than went on with Succe&s;s, as it had done before; It is true the <HI>Jews</HI> fell into Sects and Errors, and Divi&s;ions of many Kinds, after the Return from the Captivity, and no doubt the <HI>Devil</HI> had a great Hand in tho&s;e Divi&s;ions; but he could never bring them back to Idolatry, and his not being able to do that, made him turn his Hand &s;o many Ways to plague and oppre&s;s them; as particularly by <HI>Antiochus</HI> the Great, who brought the Abomination of De&s;olation into the holy Place; and there the Devil triumph'd over them for &s;ome Time; but they were deliver'd many Ways, till at la&s;t they came peaceably un|der the Protection rather than the Dominion of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire: When <HI>Herod</HI> the Great go|vern'd them as a King, and reedified, nay almo&s;t
<PB N="191" REF="201">
rebuilt their Temple, with &s;o great an Expence and Magnificence, that he made it, as &s;ome &s;ay, greater and more glorious than that of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s, tho' that I take to be a great&mdash;Fable, to &s;ay no wor&s;e of it.</P>
<P>In this Condition the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church &s;tood, when the Fullne&s;s of Time, as 'tis call'd in Scrip|ture, was come; and the <HI>Devil</HI> was kept at Bay, tho' he had made &s;ome Encroachments upon them as above; for there was a glorious Rem|nant of Saints among <HI>them,</HI> &s;uch as old <HI>Zacha|rias</HI> the Father of <HI>John</HI> the Bapti&s;t, and old <HI>Si|meon,</HI> who waited for the Salvation of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI> I &s;ay, in this Condition the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Church &s;tood when the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> came into the World, which was &s;uch another mortal Stab to the Thrones and Principalities Infernal, as that of which I have &s;po|ken already in Chap. III. at the Creation of Man; and therefore with this I break off the Antiquities of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, or the antient Part of his Kingdom; for from hence downward we &s;hall find his Empire has declin'd gradually, and tho' by his wonderful Addre&s;s, his prodigious Applica|tion, and the Vigilance and Fidelity of his In&s;tru|ments, as well humane as infernal and diabolical, and of the Humane as well the Eccle&s;ia&s;tic as the Secular; he has many Times retriev'd what he has lo&s;t, and &s;ometimes bid fair for recovering the univer&s;al Empire he once po&s;&s;e&s;s'd over Man|kind, yet he has been &s;till defeated again, repul&s;t and beaten back, and his Kingdom has greatly declin'd in many Parts of the World; and e&s;pe|cially in the Northern Parts, except <HI>Great Bri|tain;</HI> and how he has politically maintain'd his Intere&s;t and encrea&s;ed his Dominion among the wi&s;e and righteous Generation that we cohabit with and among, will be the Subject of the <HI>Mo|dern</HI> Part of <HI>Satan</HI>'s <HI>Hi&s;tory,</HI> and of which we are next to give an Account.</P>

<HEAD>PART II. OF THE MODERN HISTORY OF THE DEVIL.</HEAD>
<DIV2 N="1" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. I.</HEAD>
<P>I Have examined the Antiquities of Satan's Hi&s;tory in the former Part of this Work, and brought his Affairs down from the Crea|tion, as far as to our ble&s;&s;ed Chri&s;tian Times; e&s;pecially to the Coming of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> when one would think the <HI>Devil</HI> could have nothing to do among us. I have indeed but touch'd at &s;ome Things which might have admitted of a farther De&s;cription of Satan's Affairs, and the Particulars of which we may all come to a farther Knowledge of hereafter; yet I think I have &s;poken to the material Part of his Conduct, as it relates to his Empire in this World: what has happen'd to his more &s;ublimated Government, and his Ange|lic Capacities, I &s;hall have an Occa&s;ion to touch at in &s;everal &s;olid Particulars as we go along.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="203">
The <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> was now born, <HI>the Fulne&s;s of Time was come,</HI> that the old Scrpent was to have his <HI>Head broken,</HI> that is to &s;ay, his Empire or Domi|nion over Man, which he gain'd by the Fall of our fir&s;t Father and Mother in <HI>Paradi&s;e,</HI> receiv'd a Downfal or Overthrow.</P>
<P>It is worth ob&s;erving, in order to confirm what I have already mention'd of the Limitation of Satan's Power, that not only his Angelic Strength &s;eems to have received a farther Blow upon the Coming of the Son of God into the World, but he &s;eems to have had a Blow upon his Intellects; his Serpentine Craft and <HI>Devil-like</HI> Subtilty &s;eems to have been circum&s;crib'd and cut &s;hort; and in|&s;tead of his being &s;o cunning a Fellow as before, when, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> 'tis evident he outwitted all Man|kind, not only <HI>Eve, cain, Noah, Lot,</HI> and all the Patriarchs, but even Nations of Men, and that in their publick Capacity; and thereby led them into ab&s;urd and ridiculous Things, &s;uch as the Building of <HI>Babel,</HI> and deifying and wor&s;hip|ing their Kings, when dead and rotten; idolizing <HI>Bea&s;ts, Stocks, Stones, any Thing,</HI> and even <HI>Nothing;</HI> and in a Word, when he manag'd Mankind ju&s;t as he plea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Now and from this Time forward he appear|ed a weak, fooli&s;h, ignorant <HI>Devil,</HI> compar'd to what he was before; He was upon almo&s;t every Occa&s;ion re&s;i&s;ted, di&s;appointed, baulk'd and de|feated, e&s;pecially in all his Attempts to thwart or cro&s;s the Mi&s;&s;ion and Mini&s;try of the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah,</HI> while he was upon Earth, and &s;ometimes upon other and very mean Occa&s;ions too.</P>
<P>And fir&s;t, how fooli&s;h a Project was it, and how below Satan's celebrated Artifice in like Ca&s;es, to put <HI>Herod</HI> upon &s;ending to kill the poor in|nocent Children in <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> in hopes to de&s;troy the Infant? for I take it for granted, it was the
<PB N="194" REF="204">
<HI>Devil</HI> put into <HI>Herod</HI>'s Thoughts that Executi|on, how &s;imple and fooli&s;h &s;oever; now we mu&s;t allow him to be very ignorant of the Nativity him&s;elf, or el&s;e he might ea&s;ily have guided his Friend <HI>Herod</HI> to the Place where the Infant was.</P>
<P>This &s;hews that <HI>either</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> is in general ignorant as we are, of what is to come in the World, before it is really come to pa&s;s; and con|&s;equently can foretel nothing, no not &s;o much as our famous old <HI>Merlin</HI> or <HI>Mother Shipton</HI> did, <HI>or el&s;e</HI> that great Event was hid from him by an im|mediate Power &s;uperior to his, which I cannot think neither, con&s;idering how much he was con|cern'd in it, and how certainly he knew that it was once to come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>But be that as it will, 'tis certain the <HI>Dew</HI> knew nothing where Chri&s;t was born, or when; nor was he able to direct <HI>Herod</HI> to find him out, and therefore put him upon that fooli&s;h, as well as cruel Order, to kill all the Children, that he might be &s;ure to de&s;troy the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> among the re&s;t.</P>
<P>The next &s;imple Step that the <HI>Devil</HI> took, and indeed the mo&s;t fooli&s;h one that he could ever be charg'd with, unworthy the very Dig|nity of a <HI>Devil,</HI> and below the Under&s;tanding that he always was allow'd to act with, was that of coming to tempt the <HI>Me&s;&s;iah</HI> in the Wilder|ne&s;s; it is certain, and he own'd it him&s;elf after|wards, upon many Occa&s;ions, that the <HI>Devil</HI> knew our Saviour to be the Son of God; and 'tis as certain that he knew, that <HI>as &s;uch</HI> he could have no Power or Advantage over him; how fooli&s;h then was it in him to attack him in that Manner, <HI>if thou bee&s;t the Son of</HI> GOD? why he knew him to be the <HI>Son of</HI> GOD well enough; he &s;aid &s;o afterwards, <HI>I know thee who thou art, the holy One of</HI> GOD; how then could he be &s;o weak a Devil as to &s;ay, <HI>if thou art,</HI> then do <HI>&s;o</HI> and <HI>&s;o?</HI></P>
<P><PB N="195" REF="205">
The Ca&s;e is plain, the <HI>Devil,</HI> tho' he knew him to be the Son of GOD, did not fully know the My&s;tery of the Incarnation; nor did he know how far the <HI>Inanition</HI> of Chri&s;t extended, and whether, <HI>as Man,</HI> he was not &s;ubject to fall as <HI>Adam</HI> was, tho' his re&s;erv'd Godhead might be &s;till immaculate and pure; and upon this Foot, as he would leave no Method untried, he attempts him three Times, one immediately after another; but then, finding him&s;elf di&s;appointed he fled.</P>
<P>This evidently proves that the <HI>Devil</HI> was igno|rant of the great My&s;tery of Godline&s;s, <HI>as the Text calls it,</HI> God manife&s;t in the Fle&s;h, and there|fore made that fooli&s;h Attempt upon Chri&s;t, think|ing to have conquer'd his human Nature as ca|pable of Sin, which it was not; and at this Re|pul&s;e <HI>Hell</HI> groan'd, the whole Army of regimen|ted <HI>Devils</HI> receiv'd a Wound, and felt the Shock of it; 'twas a &s;econd Overthrow to them, they had had a long Chain of Succe&s;s, carried a <HI>devili&s;h</HI> Conque&s;t over the greate&s;t Part of the Creation of GOD; but now they were cut &s;hort, <HI>the Seed of the Woman</HI> was now come <HI>to break the Serpent's Head,</HI> that is, to cut &s;hort his Power, to con|tract the Limits of his Kingdom, and in a Word, to dethrone him in the World: No doubt the <HI>Devil</HI> receiv'd a Shock, for you find him always afterward, crying out in a horrible Manner, when|ever Chri&s;t met with him, or el&s;e very humble and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, as when he begg'd leave to go into the Herd of Swine, a Thing he has often done &s;ince.</P>
<P>Defeated here, the fir&s;t Stratagem I find him concern'd in after it, was his entring into <HI>Judas,</HI> and putting him upon betraying Chri&s;t to the Chief Prie&s;t; but here again he was entirely mi&s;|taken, for he did not &s;ee, <HI>as much a Devil as he was,</HI> what the Event would be; but when he
<PB N="196" REF="206">
came to know, that if Chri&s;t was put to Death, he would become a Propitiatory and be the great Sacrifice of Mankind, &s;o to re&s;cue the fallen Race from that Death they had incurr'd the Penalty of, by the Fall, that this was the fulfilling of all Scripture Prophe&s;y, and that thus it was that Chri&s;t was to be <HI>the End of the Law;</HI> I &s;ay, as &s;oon as he perceiv'd this, he &s;trove all he could to prevent it, and di&s;turb'd <HI>Pilate</HI>'s Wife in her Sleep, in order to &s;et her upon her Husband to hinder his delivering him up to the <HI>Jews;</HI> for then, and not till then, he knew how Chri&s;t was to vanqui&s;h Hell by the Power of his Cro&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Devil</HI> was di&s;appointed and expo&s;ed in every Step he took, and as he now plainly &s;aw his Kingdom declining, and even the tem|poral Kingdom of Chri&s;t, ri&s;ing up upon the Ruins of his <HI>(Satan</HI>'s) Power; he &s;eem'd to retreat into his own Region the Air, and to con&s;ult there with his fellow <HI>Devils,</HI> what Mea&s;ures he &s;hould take next to pre&s;erve his Dominion among Men; Here it was that he re&s;olv'd upon that truly hel|li&s;h Thing call'd Per&s;ecution, by which, <HI>tho' he prov'd a fooli&s;h Devil in that too,</HI> he flatter'd him|&s;elf he &s;hould be able to de&s;troy God's Church, and root out its Profe&s;&s;ors from the Earth, even almo&s;t as &s;oon as it was e&s;tabli&s;h'd; whereas on the contrary, Heaven counter-acted him there too, and tho' he arm'd the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire again&s;t the Chri&s;tians, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> the whole World, and they were fallen upon every where, with all the Fury and Rage of &s;ome of the mo&s;t flaming Tyrants that the World ever &s;aw, of whom <HI>Ne$</HI> was the fir&s;t; yet in &s;pite of Hell, GOD made all the Blood, which the Devil caus'd to be &s;pilt, to be <HI>&s;emen Eccle&s;iae,</HI> and the DEVIL had the Morti|fication to &s;ee, that the Number of Chri&s;tians en|crea&s;ed even under the very Means he made u&s;e
<PB N="197" REF="207">
of to root them out and de&s;troy them: This was the Ca&s;e thro' the Reign of all the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperors, for the fir&s;t three hundred Years after Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>Having thus tried all the Methods that be&s;t &s;uited his Inclination, I mean tho&s;e of Blood and Death, complicated with Tortures and all Kinds of Cruelty, and that for &s;o long a Stage of Time as above; the <HI>Devil</HI> all on a &s;uddain, as if glut|ted with Blood, and &s;atiated with De&s;truction, &s;its &s;till and becomes a peaceable Spectator for a good while; as if he either found him&s;elf unable, or had no Di&s;po&s;ition to hinder the Progre&s;s of Chri&s;tianity in the fir&s;t Ages of its Settlement in the World: In this interval the Chri&s;tian Church was e&s;tabli&s;h'd under <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> Re|ligion flouri&s;hed in Peace, and under the mo&s;t perfect Tranquillity: The <HI>Devil</HI> &s;eem'd to be at a Lo&s;s what he &s;hould do next, and Things began to look as if Satan's Kingdom was at an End; but he &s;oon let them &s;ee that he was the &s;ame indefa|tigable <HI>Devil</HI> that ever he was, and the Pro&s;peri|ty of the Church gave him a large Field of Ac|tion; for knowing the Di&s;po&s;ition of Mankind to Quarrel and Di&s;pute, the univer&s;al Pa&s;&s;ion rooted in Nature, e&s;pecially among the Church-Men for Precedency and Dominion, he fell to work with them immediately; &s;o that turning the Tables, and rea&s;&s;uming the Subtilty and Craft, which, I &s;ay, he &s;eem'd to have lo&s;t in the former four hundred Years, he gain'd more Ground in the next Ages of the Church, and went farther to|wards re&s;toring his Power and Empire in the World, and towards overthrowing that very Church which was &s;o lately e&s;tabli&s;h'd, than all he had done by Fire and Blood before.</P>
<P>His Policy now &s;eem'd to be edg'd with Re|&s;entment for the Mi&s;takes he had made; as if the
<PB N="198" REF="208">
Devil looking back with Anger at him&s;elf, to &s;ee what a Fool he had been to expect to cru&s;h Re|ligion by Per&s;ecution, rejoyc'd for having di&s;co|ver'd that Liberty and Dominion was the only way to ruin the Church, not Fire and Faggot; and that he had nothing to do but to give the zealous People their utmo&s;t Liberty in Religion, only &s;owing Error and Variety of Opinion among them, and they would bring Fire and Faggot in fa&s;t enough among them&s;elves.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd the&s;e were devili&s;h Poli|ticks; and &s;o &s;ure was the Aim, and &s;o certain was the <HI>Devil</HI> to hit his Mark by them, that we find he not only did not fail then, but the &s;ame helli&s;h Methods have prevail'd &s;till, and will do &s;o to the End of the World. Nor had the De|vil ever a better Game to play than this, for the Ruin of Religion, as we &s;hall have room to &s;hew in many Examples, be&s;ides that of the Di&s;|&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> who are evidently weaken'd by the late Toleration: Whether the <HI>Devil</HI> had any hand in baiting his Hook with an A&mdash;of Parlia|ment or no, Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent, but 'tis too evident he has catch'd the Fi&s;h by it; and if the hone&s;t Church of <HI>England</HI> does not in Pity and Chri&s;tian Charity to the Di&s;&s;enters, &s;traighten her Hand a little, I cannot but fear the <HI>Devil</HI> will gain his Point, and the Di&s;&s;enter will be undone by it.</P>
<P>Upon this new foot of Politicks the <HI>Devil</HI> began with the Emperors them&s;elves: <HI>Arius,</HI> the Father of the Hereticks of that Age, having broach'd his Opinions, and <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> the ortho|dox Bi&s;hop of the Ea&s;t oppo&s;ing him, the <HI>Devil</HI> no &s;ooner &s;aw the Door open to Strife and Impo|&s;ition, but he thru&s;t him&s;elf in, and rai&s;ing the Quarrel up to a &s;uited Degree of Rage and Spleen, he involv'd the good Emperor him&s;elf in it fir&s;t, and <HI>Athana&s;ius</HI> was bani&s;h'd and recall'd, and ba|ni&s;h'd
<PB N="199" REF="209">
and recall'd again, &s;everal times, as Error ran high, and as the <HI>Devil</HI> either got or lo&s;t Ground: After <HI>Con&s;tantine,</HI> the next Emperor was a Child of his own, <HI>(Arian)</HI> and then the Court came all into the Quarrel, as Courts often do, and then the <HI>Arians</HI> and the <HI>Orthodox</HI> per&s;ecuted one another as furiou&s;ly as the Pagans per&s;ecuted them all before. To &s;uch a Height the <HI>Devil</HI> brought his Conque&s;t in the very In|fancy of the Que&s;tion, and &s;o much did he pre|vail over the true Chri&s;tianity of the Primitive Church, even before they had enjoy'd the Li|berty of the pure Wor&s;hip twenty Years.</P>
<P>Flu&s;h'd with this Succe&s;s, the <HI>Devil</HI> made one Pu&s;h for the re&s;toring <HI>Pagani&s;m,</HI> and bringing on the old Wor&s;hip of the Heathen Idols and Tem|ples; but like our King <HI>James</HI> II. he drove too hard, and <HI>Julian</HI> had &s;o provok'd the whole <HI>Ro|man</HI> Empire, which was generally at that time become Chri&s;tian, that had the Apo&s;tate liv'd, he would not have been able to have held the Throne; and as he was cut off in his Begin|ning, Pagani&s;m expir'd with him, and the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf might have cry'd out, as <HI>Julian</HI> did, and with much more Propriety, <HI>Vici&s;ti Gali|lean.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Jovian,</HI> the next Emperor, being a glorious Chri&s;tian, and a very good and great Man, the <HI>Devil</HI> abdicated for a while, and left the Chri&s;ti|an Armies to re-e&s;tabli&s;h the Orthodox Faith; nor could he bring the Chri&s;tians to a Breach again among them&s;elves a great while after.</P>
<P>However, Time and a diligent <HI>Devil</HI> did the Work at la&s;t, and when the Emperors concern|ing them&s;elves one way or other, did not appear &s;ufficient to an&s;wer his End, he chang'd Hands again, and went to work with the Clergy: To &s;et the Doctors effectually together by the Ears, he
<PB N="200" REF="210">
threw in the new Notion of <HI>Primacy</HI> among them, for a Bone of Contention; the Bait took, the Prie&s;ts &s;wallow'd it eagerly down, and the <HI>Devil,</HI> a cunninger Fi&s;herman than ever St. <HI>Peter</HI> was, <HI>&s;truck them</HI> (as the Anglers call it) with a quick Hand, and hung them fa&s;t upon the Hook.</P>
<P>Having them thus in his Clutches, and they being now, as we may &s;ay, his own, they took their Mea&s;ures afterwards from him, and mo&s;t obediently follow'd his Directions; nay, I will not &s;ay but he may have had pretty much the Management of the whole Society ever &s;ince, of what Profe&s;&s;ion or Party &s;oever they may have been, with Exception only to the Reverend and Right Reverend among our &s;elves.</P>
<P>The Sacred, as above, being thus hook'd in, and the DEVIL being at the Head of their Af|fairs, Matters went on mo&s;t gloriou&s;ly his own way; fir&s;t, the Bi&s;hops &s;ell to bandying and Party-making for the Superiority, as heartily as ever Temporal Tyrants did for Dominion, and took as black and devili&s;h Methods to carry it on, as the wor&s;t of tho&s;e Tyrants ever had done before them.</P>
<P>At la&s;t Satan declar'd for the <HI>Roman</HI> Pontiff, and that upon excellent Conditions, in the Regin of the Emperor <HI>Mauritius;</HI> for <HI>Boniface,</HI> who had long contended for the Title of Supreme fell into a Treaty with <HI>Phocas,</HI> Captain of the Emperor's Guards; whether the Bargain was from Hell or not, let any one judge, the Condi|tions ab&s;olutely entitle the <HI>Devil</HI> to the Honour of making the Contract, <HI>viz.</HI> That <HI>Phocas</HI> fin$ murthering his Ma&s;ter (the Emperor) and his Sons <HI>Boniface</HI> &s;hould countenance the Trea&s;on, and declare him Emperor; and in Return, <HI>Phocas</HI> &s;hould acknowledge the Primacy of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI> and declare <HI>Boniface</HI> univer&s;al Bi&s;hop

A ble&s;&s;ed Compact! which at once &s;et the <HI>Devil</HI> at the Head of Affairs in the Chri&s;tian World, as well Spiritual as Temporal, Eccle&s;ia&s;tick and Civil. Since the Conque&s;t over <HI>Eve</HI> in Para|di&s;e, by which Death and the DEVIL, Hand in Hand, e&s;tabli&s;h'd their fir&s;t Empire upon Earth, the <HI>Devil</HI> never gain'd a more important Point than he gain'd at this time.</P>
<P>He had indeed pro&s;pered in his Affairs tolerably well for &s;ome time before this, and his Intere&s;t among the Clergy had got Ground for &s;ome Ages; but that was indeed a &s;ecret Management, was carried on privately, and with Difficulty; as in &s;owing Di&s;cord and Faction among the People, perplexing the Councils of their Princes, and &s;ecretly wheedling in with the dignified Clergy.</P>
<P>Al&s;o he had rai&s;ed abundance of little Church-Rebellions, by &s;etting up Hereticks of &s;everal Kinds, and rai&s;ing them Favourers among the Clergy, &s;uch as <HI>Ebion, Cerinthius, Pelagius,</HI> and others.</P>
<P>He had drawn in the Bi&s;hops of <HI>Rome</HI> to &s;et up the ridiculous Pageantry of the KEY; and while he, the DEVIL, &s;et open the Gates of Hell to them all, &s;et them upon locking up the Gates of Heaven, and giving the Bi&s;hop the Key; a Cheat which, as gro&s;s as it was, the DEVIL &s;o gilded over, or &s;o blinded the Age to receive it, that like <HI>Gideon</HI>'s <HI>Ephod,</HI> all the Catholick World went a whoring after the Idol; and the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome &s;em</HI> more Fools to the <HI>Devil</HI> by it than ever he pretended to let into Heaven, though he open'd the Door as wide as his Key was able to do.</P>
<P>The Story of this Key being given to the Bi|&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> by St. <HI>Peter,</HI> (who, by the way, never had it him&s;elf,) and of its being lo&s;t by Somebody or other, (the <HI>Devil</HI> it &s;eems did not

<P>Since this time indeed the Devil's Affairs went very merrily on, and the Clergy brought &s;o ma|ny Gewgaws into their Wor&s;hip, and &s;uch devili&s;h Principles were mixt with that which we call'd the Chri&s;tian Faith, that in a word, from this Time the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> commenc'd <HI>Whore of Babylon,</HI> in all the mo&s;t expre&s;s Terms that could be imagin'd: Tyranny of the wor&s;t Sort crept into the Pontificate, Errors of all Sorts into the Profe&s;&s;ion, and they proceeded from one thing to another, till the very Popes, for &s;o the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Rome</HI> was now called, by way of Di|&s;tinction; I &s;ay, the Popes them&s;elves, their &s;pi|ritual Guides, profe&s;s'd openly to confederate with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and to carry on a per&s;onal and private Corre&s;pondence with him at the &s;ame time, tak|ing
<PB N="203" REF="213">
upon them the Title of Chri&s;t's Vicar, and the infallible Guide of the Con&s;ciences of Chri&s;|tians.</P>
<P>This we have &s;undry In&s;tances of in &s;ome merry Popes, who, <HI>if Fame lies not,</HI> were Sorcerers, Magici|ans, had familiar Spirits, and immediate Conver|&s;ation with the Devil, as well vi&s;ibly as invi&s;ibly, and by this means became what we call <HI>Devils Incarnate:</HI> Upon this account it is that I have left the Conver&s;ation that pa&s;&s;es between <HI>Devils and Men</HI> to this Place, as well becau&s;e I believe it differs much now in his modern State, from what it was in his antient State, and therefore that which mo&s;t concerns us belongs rather to this part of his Hi&s;tory; as al&s;o becau&s;e, as I am now writing to the pre&s;ent Age, I choo&s;e to bring the mo&s;t &s;ignificant Parts of his Hi&s;tory, e&s;peci|ally as they relate to our &s;elves, into that Part of Time that we are mo&s;t concern'd in.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devil</HI> had once, as I ob&s;erv'd before, the univer&s;al Monarchy or Government of Mankind in him&s;elf, and I doubt not but in that flouri&s;h|ing State of his Affairs, he governed them like what he is <HI>(viz.)</HI> an ab&s;olute Tyrant; during this <HI>Theocracy</HI> of his, <HI>for</HI> Satan <HI>is call'd the God of this World,</HI> he did not familiarize him&s;elf to Man|kind &s;o much, as he finds Occa&s;ion to do now, there was not then &s;o much need of it; he govern|ed then with an ab&s;olute Sway; he had his Ora|cles, where he gave Audience to his Votaries like a Deity, and he had his Sub-Gods, who un|der his &s;everal Di&s;po&s;itions receiv'd the Homage of Mankind in their Names; &s;uch were all the Rabble of the Heathen Deities, from <HI>Jupiter</HI> the Supreme, to the <HI>Lares</HI> or Hou&s;hold Gods of every Family; the&s;e, I &s;ay, like Re&s;idents, received the Pro&s;trations, but the Homage was all Satan's; the Devil had the Sub&s;tance of it all, which was the Idolatry.</P>
<P><PB N="204" REF="214">
During this Admini&s;tration of <HI>Hell,</HI> there was le&s;s Witchcraft, le&s;s true literal Magic than there has been &s;ince; there was indeed no need of it, the DEVIL did not &s;toop to the Mechani&s;m of his more modern Operations, but rul'd as a Deity, and receiv'd the Vows and the Bows of his Subjects in more State, and with more Solemnity; whereas &s;ince that, he is content to employ more Agents and take more Pains him&s;elf too; now he runs up and down Hackney in the World, more like a Drudge than a Prince, and much more than he did then.</P>
<P>Hence all tho&s;e Things we call Apparitions and Vi&s;ions of Gho&s;ts, Familiar-Spirits and Dealings with the Devil, of which there is &s;o great a Va|riety in the World at this Time, were not &s;o much known among the People, in tho&s;e fir&s;t Ages of the Devil's Kingdom; <HI>in a Word,</HI> the Devil &s;eems to be put to his Shifts, and to fly to Art and Stratagem for the carrying on his Affairs, much more now than he did then.</P>
<P>One Rea&s;on for this may be, that he has been more di&s;cover'd and expos'd in the&s;e Ages, than he was before; Then he could appear in the World in his own proper Shapes, and yet not be known; when the Sons of God appear'd at the divine Summons, Satan came along with them; but now he has plaid &s;o many &s;curvy Tricks upon Men, and they know him &s;o well, that he is oblig'd to play quite out of &s;ight and act in Di&s;gui&s;e; Mankind will allow nothing of his Doing, and hear no|thing of his Saying, in his own Name; and if you propo&s;e any Thing to be done, and it be but &s;aid the <HI>Devil</HI> is to help in the doing it, or if you &s;ay of any Man he deals with the <HI>Devil,</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI> has a Hand in it, every Body flies him and &s;huns him, as the mo&s;t frightful Thing in the World.</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="215">
Nay, if any Thing &s;trange and improbable be done or related to be done, we pre&s;ently &s;ay the <HI>Devil</HI> was at the doing it: Thus the great Ditch at <HI>Newmarket Heath,</HI> is call'd the <HI>Devil</HI>'s <HI>Ditch;</HI> &s;o the <HI>Devil</HI> built <HI>Crowland</HI> Abby, and the Whi&s;|pering-Place in <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> Cathedral; nay, the Cave at <HI>Ca&s;tleton,</HI> only becau&s;e there's no getting to the farther End of it, is call'd the <HI>Devil's</HI> A&mdash;and the like: The poor People of <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> when you ask them how the great Stones at <HI>Stonehenge</HI> were brought thither? they'll all tell you the <HI>De|vil</HI> brought them: If any Mi&s;chief extraordinary befalls us, we pre&s;ently &s;ay the <HI>Devil</HI> was in it, and the <HI>Devil</HI> would have it &s;o; in a Word, the <HI>Devil</HI> has got an ill Name among us, and &s;o he is fain to act more <HI>in Tenebris,</HI> more <HI>incog.</HI> than he u&s;ed to do, play out of &s;ight him&s;elf, and work by the Sap, as the Engineers call it, and not open|ly and avowedly in his own Name and Per&s;on, as formerly, tho' perhaps not with le&s;s Succe&s;s than he did before; and this leads me to enquire more narrowly into the Manner of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Manage|ment of his Affairs &s;ince the Chri&s;tian Religion began to &s;pread in the World, which manife&s;tly differs from his Conduct in more antient Times; in which if we di&s;cover &s;ome of the mo&s;t con&s;um|mate Fool's Policy, the mo&s;t profound &s;imple Craft, and the mo&s;t &s;ubtle &s;hallow Management of Things that can by our weak Under&s;tandings be conceiv'd, we mu&s;t only re&s;olve it into this, that in &s;hort it is the DEVIL.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II. <HI>Of Hell as it is repre&s;ented to us, and how the</HI> Devil <HI>is to be under&s;tood, as being per|&s;onally in Hell, when at the &s;ame Time we find him at Liberty ranging over the World.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT is true, as that learn'd and plea&s;ant Author, the inimitable Dr. <HI>Brown</HI> &s;ays, the <HI>Devil</HI> is his own Hell; one of the mo&s;t con&s;tituting Parts of his In|felicity is, that he cannot act upon Mankind <HI>brevi Manu,</HI> by his own inherent Power, as well as Rage; that he cannot unhinge this Creation, which, <HI>as I have ob&s;erv'd in its Place,</HI> he had the utmo&s;t Aver&s;i|on to from its Beginning, as it was a &s;tated De&s;ign in the Creator to &s;upply his Place in Heaven with a new Species of <HI>Being</HI> call'd <HI>Man,</HI> and fill the Vacancies occa&s;ion'd by his Degeneracy and Re|bellion.</P>
<P>This fill'd him with Rage inexpre&s;&s;ible, and horrible Re&s;olutions of Revenge, and the Impo&s;|&s;ibility of executing tho&s;e Re&s;olutions torments him with De&s;pair; this added to what he was before, makes him a compleat <HI>Devil,</HI> with a Hell in his own Brea&s;t, and a Fire unquenchable burn|ing about his Heart.</P>
<P>I might enlarge here, and very much to the Purpo&s;e, in de&s;cribing &s;pherially and mathemati|cally that exqui&s;ite Quality call'd <HI>a devili&s;h Spi|rit,</HI> in which it would naturally occur to give you a whole Chapter upon the glorious Articles of <HI>Malice</HI> and <HI>Envy,</HI> and e&s;pecially upon that lu&s;cious, delightful, triumphant Pa&s;&s;ion call'd REVENGE; How natural to Man, nay even to both Sexes; How plea&s;ant in the very Contemplation, tho'
<PB N="207" REF="217">
there be not ju&s;t at that Time a Power of Exe|cution; How palatable it is in it &s;elf, and how well it reli&s;hes when di&s;h'd up with its proper Sauces, &s;uch as Plot, Contrivance, Scheme, and Confederacy, all leading on to Execution: How it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es humane Soul in all the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Parts; how it empowers Mankind to &s;in in I|magination, as effectually to all future Intents and Purpo&s;es (Damnation) as if he had &s;inned actually: How &s;afe a Practice it is too, as to Pu|ni&s;hment in this Life, namely, that it empowers us to cut Throats clear of the Gallows, to &s;lan|der Virtue, reproach Innocence, wound Honour and &s;tab Reputation; and in a Word, to do all the wicked Things in the World, out of the Reach of the Law.</P>
<P>It would al&s;o require &s;ome few Words to de|&s;cribe the &s;ecret Operations of tho&s;e nice Quali|ties when they reach the humane Soul; how ef|fectually they form a Hell within us, and how imperceptibly they a&s;&s;imilate and transform us in|to <HI>Devils,</HI> meer humane Devils, as really <HI>Devils</HI> as Satan him&s;elf, or any of his Angels; and that there|fore 'tis not &s;o much out of the Way, as &s;ome imagine, to &s;ay, &s;uch a Man is an <HI>incarnate</HI> Devil; for as Crime made Satan a <HI>Devil,</HI> who was before a bright immortal Seraph, or Angel of Light; how much more ea&s;ily may the &s;ame Crime make <HI>the &s;ame</HI> DEVIL, tho' every Way meaner and more contemptible, <HI>of a Man or</HI> a Woman either? But this is too grave a Subject for me at this Time.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devil</HI> being thus, I &s;ay, fir'd with Rage and Envy, in con&s;equence of his Jealou&s;y upon the Creation of Man, his Torment is encrea&s;ed to the highe&s;t by the Limitation of his Power, and his being forbid to act again&s;t Mankind by Force of Arms; this is, I &s;ay, Part of his <HI>Hell,</HI> which, as above, is within him, and which he
<PB N="208" REF="218">
carries with him wherever he goes; nor is it &s;o difficult to conceive of <HI>Hell,</HI> or of the <HI>Devil,</HI> either under this ju&s;t De&s;cription, as it is by all the u&s;ual Notions that we are taught to enter|tain of them, by (the old Women) our In&s;truc|tors; for every Man may, by taking but a com|mon View of him&s;elf, and making a ju&s;t Scrutiny into his own Pa&s;&s;ions, on &s;ome of their particular Excur&s;ions, &s;ee a <HI>Hell</HI> within him&s;elf, and him&s;elf a meer <HI>Devil</HI> as long as the Inflammation la&s;ts; and that as really, and to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, as if he had the Angel <HI>(Satan)</HI> before his Face, in his Lo|cality and Per&s;onality; that is to &s;ay, all Devil and Mon&s;ter in his Per&s;on, and an immaterial but inten&s;e Fire flaming about and from within him, at all the Pores of his Body.</P>
<P>The Notions we receive of the Devil, <HI>as a Per|&s;on</HI> being in Hell <HI>as a Place,</HI> are infinitely ab&s;urd and ridiculous; the fir&s;t we are certain is not true in Fact, becau&s;e he has a certain Liberty, <HI>(however limited</HI> that is not to the Purpo&s;e) is daily vi&s;ible, and to be trac'd in his &s;everal Attacks upon Man|kind, and has been &s;o ever &s;ince his fir&s;t Appear|ance in <HI>Paradi&s;e;</HI> as to his corporal Vi&s;ibility that is not the pre&s;ent Que&s;tion neither; 'tis enough that we can hunt him by the Foot, that we can follow him as Hounds do a Fox upon a hot Scent: We can &s;ee him as plainly by the Effect, by the Mi&s;chief he does, and more by the Mi&s;chief he puts us upon doing, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> as plainly, as if we &s;aw him by the Eye.</P>
<P>It is not to be doubted but the <HI>Devil</HI> can &s;ee us when and where we cannot &s;ee him; and as he has a Per&s;onality, tho' it be &s;piritous, he and his Angels too may be rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed to inhabit the World of Spirits, and to have free Acce&s;s from thence to the Regions of Life, and to pa&s;s and repa&s;s in the Air, as really, tho' not preceptible to
<PB N="209" REF="219">
us, as the Spirits of Men do after their relea&s;e from the Body, pa&s;s to the Place (wherever that is) which is appointed for them.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Devil</HI> was confin'd to a Place <HI>(Hell)</HI> as a Pri&s;on, he could then have no Bu&s;ine&s;s here; and if we pretend to de&s;cribe <HI>Hell,</HI> as not a Pri&s;on, but that the Devil has Liberty to be there, or not be there as he plea&s;ed, then he would certainly never be there, or <HI>Hell</HI> is not &s;uch a Place as we are taught to under&s;tand it to be.</P>
<P>Indeed according to &s;ome, <HI>Hell</HI> &s;hould be a Place of Fire and Torment to the Souls that are ca&s;t into it, but not to the <HI>Devils</HI> them&s;elves; who we make little more or le&s;s than Keepers and Turnkeys to Hell, as a Goal; that they are &s;ent about to bring Souls thither, lock them in when they come, and then away upon the Scent to fetch more: That one Sort of <HI>Devils</HI> are made to live in the World among Men, and to be bu&s;y continually debauching and deluding Mankind bringing them as it were to the Gates of <HI>Hell;</HI> and then another Sort are Porters and Carriers to fetch them in.</P>
<P>This is, <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> little more or le&s;s than the old Story of <HI>Pluto,</HI> of <HI>Cerberus,</HI> and of <HI>Charon;</HI> only that our Tale is not half &s;o well told, nor the Parts of the Fable &s;o well laid together.</P>
<P>In all the&s;e Notions of <HI>Hell</HI> and <HI>Devil,</HI> the Tor|ments of the fir&s;t, and the Agency of the la&s;t Tormenting, we meet with not one Word of the main and perhaps only Accent of Horror, which belongs to us to judge of about Hell, I mean the Ab&s;ence of Heaven; Expul&s;ion, and Exclu&s;ion from the Pre&s;ence and Face of the chief Ultimate, the only eternal and &s;ufficient Good; and this Lo&s;s &s;u&s;tain'd by a &s;ordid Neglect of our Concern in that excellent Part, in ex|change for the mo&s;t contemptible and ju&s;tly con|demn'd
<PB N="210" REF="220">
Trifles, and all this eternal and irreco|verable: The&s;e People tell us nothing of the eter|nal Reproaches of Con&s;cience, the Horror of De&s;|peration, and the Angui&s;h of a Mind hopele&s;s of ever &s;eeing the Glory, which alone con&s;titutes Heaven, and which makes all other Places dread|ful, and even Darkne&s;s it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And this brings me directly to the Point in Hand, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the State of that Hell which we ought to have in view when we &s;peak of the <HI>Devil</HI> as <HI>in Hell:</HI> This is the very Hell, which is the Tor|ment of the <HI>Devil;</HI> in &s;hort, the <HI>Devil</HI> is in HELL, and HELL is in the <HI>Devil;</HI> he is fill'd with this unquenchable Fire, he is expel'd the Place of Glory, bani&s;h'd from the Regions of Light, Ab&s;ence from the Life of all Beatitude is his Cur&s;e, De&s;pair is the reigning Pa&s;&s;ion in his Mind, and all the little Con&s;tituting Parts of his Tor|ment, &s;uch as Rage, Envy, Malice, and Jealou&s;y are con&s;olidated in this, to make his Mi&s;ery com|pleat, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Duration of it all, the Eternity of his Condition; that he is without Hope, with|out Redemption, without Recovery.</P>
<P>If any thing can inflame this <HI>Hell</HI> and make it hotter, 'tis this only, and this does add an inex|pre&s;&s;ible Horror to the Devil him&s;elf; <HI>namely,</HI> the &s;eeing Man (the only Creature he hates) placed in a State of Recovery, a glorious E&s;tabli&s;hment of Redemption form'd for him in Heaven, and the Scheme of it perfected on Earth; by which <HI>this Man,</HI> tho' even the <HI>Devil</HI> by his Art may have de|luded him, and drawn him into Crime, is yet in a State of Recovery, which the Devil is not; and that it is not in his <HI>(Satan)</HI> Power to prevent it: Now take the Devil as he is in his own Nature Angelic, a bright immortal Seraph, Heaven-born, and having ta&s;ted the eternal Beatitude, which the&s;e are appointed to enjoy; the Lo&s;s of that

State to him&s;elf, the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it granted to his Rival, tho' wicked like and as him&s;elf; I &s;ay, take the Devil as he is, having a quick Sen&s;e of his own Perdition, and a &s;tinging Sight of his Rival's Fe|licity, 'tis <HI>Hell enough,</HI> and more than enough, even for an Angel to &s;upport; nothing we can conceive of can be wor&s;e.</P>
<P>As to any other Fire than this, &s;uch and &s;o im|materially inten&s;e as to Torment a Spirit, which is it &s;elf Fire al&s;o; I will not &s;ay it cannot be, becau&s;e to Infinite every Thing is po&s;&s;ible, but I mu&s;t &s;ay, I cannot conceive rightly of it.</P>
<P>I will not enter here into the Wi&s;dom or Rea|&s;onablene&s;s of repre&s;enting the Torments of Hell to be Fire, and that Fire to be a Commixture of <HI>Flame</HI> and <HI>Sulphur;</HI> it has plea&s;ed God to let the Horror of tho&s;e eternal Agonies about <HI>a lo&s;t Heaven,</HI> be laid before us by tho&s;e Similitudes or Allegories, which are mo&s;t moving to our Sen&s;es and to our Under&s;tandings; nor will I di&s;pute the Po&s;&s;i|bility; much le&s;s will I doubt but that there is to be a Con&s;ummation of Mi&s;ery to all the Objects of Mi&s;ery when the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Kingdom in this World ending with the World it &s;elf, that Liberty he has now may be farther abridg'd; when he may be return'd to the &s;ame State he was in between the Time of his Fall and the Creation of the World; with perhaps &s;ome additional Vengeance on him, &s;uch as at pre&s;ent we cannot de&s;cribe, for all that Trea&s;on and tho&s;e high Crimes and Mi&s;demeanours which he has been guilty of here, in his Conver|&s;ation with Mankind.</P>

<P>It is the &s;ame thing as to the State of the <HI>Devil</HI> in tho&s;e Regions which he now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, and where he now more particularly inhabits; my pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s then is not to enter into tho&s;e grave Things &s;o as to make them ridiculous, as I think mo&s;t People do that talk of them; but as the <HI>Devil,</HI> let his Re&s;idence be where it will, has evidently free Leave to come and go, not into this World only; <HI>(I mean, the Region of our Atmo&s;phere,)</HI> but for ought we know, to all the other inhabited Worlds which God has made, where-ever they are, and by what&s;oever Names they are or may be known or di&s;tingui&s;hed; for if he is not confined in one Place, we have no Rea&s;on to believe he is excluded from any Place, Heaven only excepted, from whence he was ex|pell'd for his Trea&s;on and Rebellion.</P>
<P>His Liberty then being thus a&s;certain'd, three Things &s;eem to be material for us to give an Ac|count
<PB N="214" REF="224">
of, in order to form this Part of his Hi&s;|tory.</P>
<P N="1">1. What his Bu&s;ine&s;s is on this Globe of Earth which we vulgarly call the World, how he acts among us, what Affairs Mankind and he have together, and how far his Conduct here relates to Us, and Ours is, or may be influenc'd by him.</P>
<P N="2">2. Where his principal Re&s;idence is, and whe|ther he has not a particular Empire of his own, to which he retreats upon proper Occa&s;ions; where he entertains his Friends when they come under his particular Admi|ni&s;tration; and where, when he gets any Victory over his Enemies, he carries his Pri|&s;oners of War.</P>
<P N="3">3. What may probably be the great Bu&s;ine&s;s this black Emperor has at pre&s;ent upon his Hands, either in this World or out of it, and by what Agents he works.</P>
<P>As the&s;e Things may perhaps run promi&s;cuou&s;ly thro' the Cour&s;e of this whole Work, and fre|quently be touch'd at under other Branches of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, &s;o I do not propo&s;e them as Heads of Chapters or particular Sections, for the Order of Di&s;cour&s;e to be handled apart; for (by the way) as Satan's Actings have not been the mo&s;t regular Things in the World, &s;o in our Di&s;cour&s;e about him, it mu&s;t not be expected that we can always tie our &s;elves down to Order and Regularity, either as to Time, or Place, or Per|&s;ons; for Satan being <HI>hic &amp; ubique,</HI> a loo&s;e un|govern'd Fellow, we mu&s;t be content to trace him where we can find him.</P>
<P>It is true, in the foregoing Chapter, I &s;hew'd you the DEVIL entred into the Herd Eccle&s;ia&s;tick,
<PB N="215" REF="225">
and gave you &s;ome Account of the fir&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful Step he took with Mankind &s;ince the Chri&s;tian Epocha; how having &s;ecretly managed both Temporal and Spiritual Power apart, and by them&s;elves, he now united them in Point of Ma|nagement, and brought the Church U&s;urpation and the Army's U&s;urpation together; the Pope to ble&s;s the General in depo&s;ing and murthering his Ma&s;ter the Emperor; and the General to recog|ni&s;e the Pope in dethroning his Ma&s;ter Chri&s;t Je&s;us.</P>
<P>From this time forward you are to allow the <HI>Devil</HI> a my&s;tical Empire in this World; not an Action of Moment done without him, not a Trea&s;on but he has a Hand in it, not a Tyrant but he prompts him, not a Government but he has a&mdash;in it; not a Fool but he tickles him, not a Knave but he guides him; he has a Finger in every Fraud, a Key to every Cabinet, from the <HI>Divan</HI> at <HI>Con&s;tantinople,</HI> to the <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi</HI> in <HI>France,</HI> and to the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Cheats at&mdash;; from the fir&s;t Attack upon the Chri&s;tian World, in the Per&s;on of the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Antichri&s;t, down to the Bull <HI>Unigenitus;</HI> and from the Mixture of St. <HI>Pe|ter</HI> and <HI>Confucius</HI> in <HI>China,</HI> to the Holy Office in <HI>Spain;</HI> and down to the <HI>Emlins</HI> and <HI>Dodwells</HI> of the current Age.</P>
<P>How he has managed, and does manage, and how in all Probability he will manage till his Kingdom &s;hall come to a Period, and how at la&s;t he will probably be managed him&s;elf, <HI>En|quire within, and you &s;hall know farther.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the Manner of</HI> Satan<HI>'s acting and carry|ing on his Affairs in this World, and par|ticularly of his ordinary Workings in the dark, by</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion <HI>and</HI> Agitation.</HEAD>
<P>THE DEVIL being thus reduc'd to act upon Mankind by Stratagem only, it remains to enquire how he performs, and which way he di|rects his Attacks; the Faculties of Man are a kind of a Garri&s;on in a &s;trong Ca&s;tle, which as they defend it on the one hand under the Command of the rea&s;oning Power of Man's Soul, &s;o they are pre&s;cribed on the other hand, and can't fally out without Leave; for the Governor of a Fort does not permit his Soldiers to hold any Corre|&s;pondence with the Enemy, without &s;pecial Or|der and Direction. Now the great Enquiry be|fore us is, How comes the DEVIL to a Parle with us? how does he conver&s;e with our Sen&s;es, and with the Under&s;tanding? How does he reach us, which way does he come at the Affections, and which way does he move the Pa&s;&s;ions? 'Tis a little difficult to di&s;cover this trea&s;onable Corre|&s;pondence, and that Difficulty is indeed the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Advantage, and, for ought I &s;ee, the chief Ad|vantage he has over Mankind.</P>
<P>It is al&s;o a great Enquiry here, whether the <HI>Devil</HI> knows our Thoughts or no? If I may give my Opinion, I am with the negative; I deny that he knows any thing of our Thoughts, except of tho&s;e Thoughts which he puts us upon thinking, for I will not doubt but he has the Art to inject Thoughts, and to revive dormant Thoughts in us: It is not &s;o wild a Scheme as &s;ome take it to be,
<PB N="217" REF="227">
that Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> lays down, to repre&s;ent the <HI>Devil</HI> injecting corrupt De&s;ires and wandring Thoughts into the Head of <HI>Eve,</HI> by Dreams, and that he brought her to dream whatever he put into her Thoughts, by whi&s;pering to her vocally when &s;he was a&s;leep; and to this End, he imagines the DEVIL laying him&s;elf clo&s;e to her Ear, in the Shape of a Toad, when &s;he was fa&s;t a&s;leep; I &s;ay, this is not &s;o wild a Scheme, &s;eeing even now, if you can whi&s;per any thing clo&s;e to the Ear of a Per&s;on in a deep Sleep, &s;o as to &s;peak di&s;tinctly to the Per&s;on, and yet not awaken him, as has been frequently tried, the Per&s;on &s;leeping &s;hall dream di&s;tinctly of what you &s;ay to him; nay, &s;hall dream the very Words you &s;ay.</P>
<P>We have then no more to ask, but how the DEVIL can convey him&s;elf to the Ear of a &s;leep|ing Per&s;on, and it is granted then that he may have Power to make us dream what he plea&s;es: But this is not all, for if he can &s;o forcibly, by his invi&s;ible Application, cau&s;e us to dream what he plea&s;es, why can he not with the &s;ame Facility prompt our Thoughts, whether &s;leeping or waking? To dream, is nothing el&s;e but to think &s;leeping; and we have abundance of deep-headed Gentlemen among us, who give us ample Te&s;ti|mony that they dream waking.</P>
<P>But if the DEVIL can prompt us to dream, that is to &s;ay, to think, yet if he does not know our Thoughts, how then can he tell whether the Whi&s;per had its Effect? The An&s;wer is plain, the DEVIL, like the Angler, baits the Hook, if the Fi&s;h bite he lies ready to take the Advantage, he whi&s;pers to the Imagination, and then waits to &s;ee how it works; as <HI>Naomi</HI> &s;aid to <HI>Ruth,</HI> Chap. iii. 5, 18. <HI>Sit &s;till, my Daughter, until thou know how the Matter will fall, for the Man will not be at re&s;t until he have fini&s;hed the thing.</HI> Thus
<PB N="218" REF="228">
when the DEVIL had whi&s;per'd to <HI>Eve</HI> in her Sleep, <HI>according to Milton,</HI> and &s;ugge&s;ted Mi&s;chief to her Imagination, he only &s;at &s;till to &s;ee how the Matter would work, for he knew if it took with her, he &s;hould hear more of it; and then by finding her alone the next Day, without her ordinary Guard her Husband, he pre&s;ently con|cluded &s;he had &s;wallowed the Bait, and &s;o at|tack'd her afre&s;h.</P>
<P>A &s;mall deal of Craft, and le&s;s by far than we have rea&s;on to believe the <HI>Devil</HI> is Ma&s;ter of, will &s;erve to di&s;cover whether &s;uch and &s;uch Thoughts as he knows he has &s;ugge&s;ted, have taken Place or no; the Action of the Per&s;on pre&s;ently di&s;co|vers it, at lea&s;t to him that lies always upon the Watch, and has every Word, every Ge&s;ture, e|very Step we take &s;ub&s;equent to his Operation, open to him; it may therefore, for ought we know, be a great Mi&s;take, and what mo&s;t of us are guilty of, to tell our Dreams to one another in the Morning, after we have been di&s;turb'd with them in the Night; for if the <HI>Devil</HI> conver&s;es with us &s;o in&s;en&s;ibly as &s;ome are of the Opinion he does, <HI>that is to &s;ay,</HI> if he can hear as far as we can &s;ee, we may be telling our Story to him indeed, when we think we are only talking to one another.</P>
<P>This brings me mo&s;t naturally to the impor|tant Enquiry, whether the <HI>Devil</HI> can walk about the World invi&s;ibly or no? The Truth is, this is no que&s;tion to me; for as I have taken away his Vi&s;ibility already, and have denied him all Pre&s;cience of Futurity too, and have prov'd he cannot know our Thoughts, nor put any Force upon Per&s;ons or Actions, if we &s;hould take away his Invi&s;ibility too, we &s;hould <HI>undevil</HI> him quite, to all Intents and Purpo&s;es, as to any Mi&s;chief he could do; nay, it would bani&s;h him the World,
<PB N="219" REF="229">
and he might e'en go and &s;eek his Fortune &s;ome where el&s;e; for if he could neither be Vi&s;ible or Invi&s;ible, neither act in Publick or in Private, he could neither have Bu&s;ine&s;s or Being in this Sphere, nor cou'd we be any way concern'd with him.</P>
<P>The <HI>Devil</HI> therefore mo&s;t certainly has a Power and Liberty of moving about in this World, af|ter <HI>&s;ome manner or another;</HI> this is verify'd as well by way of Allegory, as by way of Hi&s;tory, in the Scripture it &s;elf; and as the fir&s;t &s;trongly &s;ugge&s;ts and &s;uppo&s;es it to be &s;o, the la&s;t po&s;i|tively a&s;&s;erts it; and, not to croud this Work with Quotations from a Book which we have not much to do with in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Story, at lea&s;t not much to his Satisfaction, I only hint his per&s;onal Appearance to our Saviour in the Wil|derne&s;s, where it is &s;aid, <HI>the Devil taketh him up to an exceeding high Mountain;</HI> and in another Place, <HI>the Devil departed from him.</HI> What Shape or Figure he appear'd in, we do not find men|tioned, but I cannot doubt his appearing to him there, any more than I can his talking to our Saviour in the Mouths, and with the Voices of the &s;everal Per&s;ons who were under the terrible Affliction of an actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e Things leave us no room to doubt of what is advanced above, namely, that he, (the <HI>Devil)</HI> has a certain Re&s;idence, or Liberty of re&s;iding in, and moving about upon the Surface of this Earth, as well as in the Compa&s;s of the Atmo&s;phere, vulgarly call'd the Air, in &s;ome man|ner or other: That is the general.</P>
<P>It remains to enquire into the manner, which I re&s;olve into two Kinds;</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Ordinary,</HI> which I &s;uppo&s;e to be his invi|&s;ible Motions as a Spirit; under which Con|&s;ideration
<PB N="220" REF="230">
I &s;uppo&s;e him to have an uncon|fin'd, unlimited, unre&s;train'd Liberty, as to the Manner of acting; and this either in Per&s;ons, by Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; or in Things, by Agitation.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>Extraordinary;</HI> which I under&s;tand to be his Appearances in borrowed Shapes and Bo|dies, or Shadows rather of Bodies; a&s;&s;uming Speech, Figure, Po&s;ture, and &s;everal Pow|ers, of which we can give little or no Ac|count; in which extraordinary Manner of Appearances, he is either limited by a &s;upe|rior Power, or limits him&s;elf $olicically, as being not the Way mo&s;t for his Intere&s;t or Purpo&s;e, to act in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, which is more effectually done in his State of Ob&s;cu|rity.</P>
<P>Hence we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> has it very much in his own Choice, whether to act in one Capacity, or in the other, or in both; that is to &s;ay, of appearing, and not appearing, as he finds for his Purpo&s;e: In this State of Invi&s;ibility, and under the Operation of the&s;e Powers and Liberties, he per&s;orms all his Functions and Offices, as <HI>Devil,</HI> as Prince of Darkne&s;s, as God of this World, as Tempter, Accu&s;er, Deceiver, and all what&s;oever other Names of Office, or Titles of Honour he is known by.</P>
<P>Now taking him in this large unlimited, or little limited State of Action, he is well call'd, <HI>the God of this World,</HI> for he has very much of the Attribute of Omnipre&s;ence, and may be &s;aid, <HI>either by him&s;elf or his Agents,</HI> to be every where, and &s;ee every thing; that is to &s;ay, every thing that is vi&s;ible; for I cannot allow him any Share of <HI>Omni&s;cience</HI> at all.</P>
<P><PB N="221" REF="231">
That he ranges about every where, is <HI>with us,</HI> and &s;ometimes <HI>in us,</HI> &s;ees when he is not &s;een, hears when he is not heard, comes in without Leave, and goes out without Noi&s;e, is neither to be &s;hut in or &s;hut out, that when he runs <HI>from us</HI> we can't catch him, and when he runs <HI>after us</HI> we can't e&s;cape him, is &s;een when he is not known, and is known when he is not &s;een; all the&s;e things, and more, we have Knowledge enough about to convince us of the Truth of them; &s;o that, as I have &s;aid above, he is certainly walking to and fro thro' the Earth, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> after <HI>&s;ome manner or other,</HI> and in &s;ome Figure or other, vi&s;ible or invi&s;ible, as he finds Occa&s;ion. Now in order to make our Hi&s;tory of him complete, the next Que&s;tion before us is, how, and in what man|ner he acts with Mankind? how his Kingdom is carried on, and by what Methods he does his Bu|&s;ine&s;s, for he certainly has a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s to do; he is not an idle Spectator, nor is he walk|ing about <HI>incognito,</HI> and cloth'd in Mi&s;t and Dark|ne&s;s, purely in Kindne&s;s to us, that we &s;hould not be frighted at him; but 'tis in Policy, that he may act undi&s;cover'd, that he may &s;ee and not be &s;een, may play his Game in the dark, and not be detected in his Roguery; that he may prompt Mi&s;chief, rai&s;e Tempe&s;ts, blow up Coals, kindle Strife, embroil Nations, u&s;e In&s;truments, and not be known to have his Hand in any thing, when at the &s;ame time he really has a hand in every thing.</P>
<P>Some are of Opinion, <HI>and I among the re&s;t,</HI> that if the <HI>Devil</HI> was per&s;onally and vi&s;ibly pre|&s;ent among us, and we conver&s;ed with him Face to Face, we &s;hould be &s;o familiar with him in a little time, that his ugly Figure would not affect us at all, that his Terrors would not fright us, or that we &s;hould any more trouble our &s;elves
<PB N="222" REF="232">
about him, than we did with the la&s;t great Co|met in 1678. which appear'd &s;o long and &s;o con|&s;tantly without any particular known Event, that at la&s;t we took no more Notice of it than of the other ordinary Stars which had appear'd before we or our Ance&s;tors were born.</P>
<P>Nor indeed &s;hould we have much Rea&s;on to be frighted at him, or at lea&s;t none of tho&s;e &s;illy Things could be &s;aid of him which we now amu&s;e our &s;elves about, and by which we &s;et him up like a Scare-Crow to fright Children and old Women, to fill up old Stories, make Songs and Ballads, and in a Word, carry on the low priz'd Buf|foonry of the common People; we &s;hould either &s;ee him in his Angelic Form, as he was from the Original, or if he has any Deformities entail'd upon him by the &s;upreme Sentence, and in Ju|&s;tice to the Deformity of his Crime, they would be of a &s;uperior Nature, and fitted more for our Contempt as well as Horror, than tho&s;e weak fan|cied Trifles contrived by our antient Devil-rai&s;ers and Devil-makers, to &s;eed the wayward Fancies of old Witches and Sorcerers, who cheated the ignorant World with a <HI>Devil</HI> of their own mak|ing, &s;et forth, <HI>in terrorem,</HI> with Bat's Wings, Horns, cloven Foot, long Tail, fork'd Tongue, and the like.</P>
<P>In the next Place, be his frightful Figure what it would, and his Legions as numerous as the Ho&s;t of Heaven, we &s;hould &s;ee him &s;till, as the Prince of <HI>De|vils,</HI> tho' mon&s;trous as a Dragon, flaming as a Co|met, tall as a Mountain, yet dragging his Chain after him equal to the utmo&s;t of his &s;uppo&s;ed Strength; always in Cu&s;tody of his <HI>Jailors</HI> the Angels, his Power overpower'd, his Rage cow'd and abated, or at lea&s;t aw'd and under Correction, limited and re&s;train'd; in a Word, we &s;hould &s;ee him a vanqui&s;h'd Slave, his Spirit broken,
<PB N="223" REF="233">
his Malice, tho' not abated, yet Hand-cuff'd and overpower'd, and he not able to work any Thing again&s;t us by Force; &s;o that he would be to us but like the Lions in the Tower, encag'd and lock'd up, unable to do the Hurt he wi&s;hes to do, and that we fear, or indeed any hurt at all.</P>
<P>From hence 'tis evident, that 'tis not his Bu|&s;ine&s;s to be public, or to walk up and down in the World vi&s;ibly, and in his own Shape; his Affairs require a quite different Management, as might be made apparent from the Nature of Things, and the Manner of our Actings, as Men, either with our&s;elves or to one another.</P>
<P>Nor could he be &s;erviceable in his Generation, as a public Per&s;on as now he is, or an&s;wer the End of his Party who employ him, and who, if he was to do their Bu&s;ine&s;s in public, as he does in private, would not be able to employ him at all.</P>
<P>As in our modern Meetings for the Propagation of Impudence and other Virtues, there would be no Entertainment and no Improvement for the Good of the Age, if the People did not all ap|pear in Ma&s;que, and conceal'd from the com|mon Ob&s;ervation; &s;o neither could <HI>Satan</HI> (from who&s;e Management tho&s;e more happy A&s;&s;em|blies are taken as Copies of a glorious Original) perform the u&s;ual and nece&s;&s;ary Bu&s;ine&s;s of his Profe&s;&s;ion, if he did not appear wholly in Covert and under needful Di&s;gui&s;es; how, but for the Convenience of his Habit, could he ca&s;t him&s;elf into &s;o many Shapes, act on &s;o many different Scenes, and turn &s;o many Wheels of State in the World, as he has done? as a meer profe&s;s'd <HI>De|vil</HI> he could do nothing.</P>
<P>Had he been oblig'd always to act the meer Devil in his own Clothes, and with his own Shape, appearing uppermo&s;t in all Ca&s;es and Places, he
<PB N="224" REF="234">
could never have preach'd in &s;o many Pulpits, pre&s;ided in &s;o many Councils, voted in &s;o many Committees, &s;at in &s;o many Courts, and influenc'd &s;o many Parties and Factions in Church and State, as we have Rea&s;on to believe he has done in our Nation, and in our Memories too, as well as in other Nations and in more antient Times. The Share Satan has had in all the weighty Confu&s;ions of the Times, ever &s;ince the fir&s;t Ages of Chri&s;ti|anity in the World, has been carried on with &s;o much Secre&s;y, and &s;o much with an Air of Ca|bal and Intrigue, that nothing can have been manag'd more &s;ubtilly and clo&s;ely, and in the &s;ame Manner has he acted in our Times, in order to conceal his Intere&s;t, and conceal the Influence he has had in the Councils of the World.</P>
<P>Had it been po&s;&s;ible for him to have rai&s;ed the Flames of Rebellion and War &s;o often in this Nation, as he certainly has done? Could he have agitated the Parties on both Sides, and inflam'd the Spirits of three Nations, if he had appear'd in his own Dre&s;s, a meer naked DEVIL? It is not the Devil as a <HI>Devil,</HI> that does the Mi&s;chief, but the <HI>Devil</HI> in Ma&s;querade, <HI>Satan</HI> in full Di&s;gui&s;e, and act|ing at the Head of civil Confu&s;ion and Di&s;traction.</P>
<P>If Hi&s;tory may be credited, the <HI>French</HI> Court at the Time of our old Confu&s;ions was made the Scene of Satan's Politicks, and prompted both Parties in <HI>England</HI> and in <HI>Scotland</HI> al&s;o to quarrel, and how was it done? Will any Man offer to &s;candalize the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;o much as to &s;ay, or &s;o much as to &s;ugge&s;t that <HI>Satan</HI> had no Hand in it all? Did not the <HI>Devil,</HI> by the Agency of Cardinal <HI>Richlieu,</HI> &s;end 400000 Crowns at one Time, and 600000 at another, to the <HI>Scots,</HI> to rai&s;e an Army and march boldly into <HI>England?</HI> and did not the &s;ame <HI>Devil,</HI> at the &s;ame time, by other Agents, remit 800000 Crowns to the other Party, in order to rai&s;e an Army to fall
<PB N="225" REF="235">
upon the <HI>Scots?</HI> nay, did not the <HI>Devil</HI> with the &s;ame Subtilty &s;end down the Archbi&s;hop's Order to impo&s;e the Service-Book upon the Peo|ple in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and at the &s;ame Time rai&s;e a Mob again&s;t it, in the great Church (at St. <HI>Giles</HI>'s)? Nay, did not he actually, in the Per&s;on of an old Woman (his favourite In&s;trument) throw the three-leg'd Stool at the Service-Book, and ani|mate the zealous People to take up Arms for Re|ligion, and turn Rebels for God Sake?</P>
<P>All the&s;e happy and &s;ucce&s;sful Undertakings, tho' 'tis no more to be doubted they were done by the Agency of <HI>Satan,</HI> and in a very &s;urpriz|ing Manner too, yet were all done in &s;ecret, by what I call Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion and Injection, and by the Agency and Contrivance of &s;uch In&s;truments, or by the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Di&s;gui&s;e of &s;uch Servants as he found out fitted to be employ'd in his Work, and who he took a more effectual Care in concealing of.</P>
<P>But we &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to touch all this Part over again, when we come to di&s;cour&s;e of the par|ticular Habits and Di&s;gui&s;es which the <HI>Devil</HI> has made u&s;e of, all along in the World, the bet|ter to cover his Actions, and to conceal his being concern'd in them.</P>
<P>In the mean Time the Cunning or Artifice the <HI>Devil</HI> makes u&s;e of in all the&s;e Things is in it &s;elf very con&s;iderable; 'tis an old Practice of his u&s;ing, and he has gone on in diver&s;e Mea&s;ures, for the better concealing him&s;elf in it; which Mea&s;ures, tho' he varies &s;ometimes, as his extraordinary Af|fairs require, yet they are in all Ages much the &s;ame, and have the &s;ame Tendency; namely, that he may get all his Bu&s;ine&s;s carried on by the In|&s;trumentality of Fools; that he may make Man|kind Agents in their own De&s;truction, and that he may have all his Work done in &s;uch a Manner

<P>INfinite Advantages attend the <HI>Devil</HI> in his re|tired Government, as they re&s;pect the Manage|ment of his Intere&s;ts, and the carrying on his ab&s;olute Monarchy in the World; particular|ly as it gives him room to act by the Agency of his inferior Mini&s;ters and Me&s;&s;engers, call'd on many Occa&s;ions <HI>his Angels,</HI> of whom he has an innumerable <HI>Multitude,</HI> at his Command, enough, for ought we know, to &s;pare one to attend every Man and Woman now alive in the World; and of whom, if we may believe our &s;econd &s;ight Chri&s;tians, the Air is always as full, as a Beam of the Evening Sun is of In&s;ects, where they are ever ready for Bu&s;ine&s;s, and to go and come as their great Governor i&s;&s;ues out Orders for their Directions.</P>

<P>How many Governments in the World are wholly in his Admini&s;tration? how many Divans and great Councils under his Direction? nay, I believe, 'twould be hard to prove that there is or has been one Council of State in the World for many hundred Years pa&s;t, down to the Year 1713, (we don't pretend to come nearer home) where the <HI>Devil</HI> by him&s;elf, or his Agents in one Shape or another, has not &s;at as a Member, if not taken the Chair.</P>

And tho' &s;ome learn'd Authors may di&s;pute this Point with me, by giving &s;ome Examples where the Councils of Princes have been acted by a better Hand, and where Things have been carried again&s;t <HI>Satan</HI>'s Intere&s;t, and even to his great Mortification, it amounts to no more than this; namely, that in &s;uch Ca&s;es the <HI>Devil</HI> has been out-voted; but it does not argue but he might have been pre&s;ent there, and have pu&s;h'd his In|tere&s;t as far as he could, only that he had not the Succe&s;s he expected; for I don't pretend to &s;ay that he has never been di&s;appointed; but tho&s;e Examples are &s;o rare, and of &s;o &s;mall Significa|tion, that when I come to the Particulars, as I &s;hall do in the Sequel of this Hi&s;tory you will find them hardly worth naming; and that, take it one Time with another, the <HI>Devil</HI> has met with &s;uch a Series of Succe&s;s in all his Affairs, and has &s;o &s;eldom been baulk'd; and where he has met with a little Check in his Politicks, has notwith|&s;tanding, &s;o &s;oon and &s;o ea&s;ily recover'd him&s;elf, regain'd his lo&s;t Ground, or replac'd him&s;elf in another Country when he has been &s;upplanted in one, that his Empire is far from being le&s;&s;en'd in the World, for the la&s;t thou&s;and Years of the Chri&s;tian E&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e we take an Ob&s;ervation from the Be|ginning of <HI>Luther,</HI> or from the Year 1420. and call the Reformation a Blow to the <HI>Devil</HI>'s King|dom, which before that was come to &s;uch a Height in Chri&s;tendom, that 'tis a Que&s;tion not yet thorowly decided, whether that Medley of Super&s;tition and horrible Here&s;ies, that Ma&s;s of Enthu&s;ia&s;m and Idols call'd the Catholick Hierar|chy, was a Church of God or a Church of the <HI>Devil;</HI> whether it was an A&s;&s;embly of Saints or a Synagogue of Satan: I &s;ay, take that Time to be the <HI>Epocha</HI> of Satan's Declen&s;ion and of Lu|cifer's

<P>To the&s;e Countries thus regain'd to Satan's infernal Empire, let us add his modern Conque&s;ts and the Encroachments he has made upon the Reformation in the pre&s;ent Age, which are, <HI>how|ever light we make of them,</HI> very con&s;iderable <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Electorate of the <HI>Rhine</HI> and the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> the one fallen to the Hou&s;e of <HI>Bavaria,</HI> and the other to that of <HI>Neuburgh,</HI> both Popi&s;h; the Dutchy of <HI>Deux Ponts</HI> fallen ju&s;t now to a popi&s;h Branch, the whole Electorate of <HI>Saxony</HI> fallen under the Power of popi&s;h Government by the Apo|&s;tacy of their Princes, and more likely to follow the Fate of <HI>Bohemia,</HI> whenever the diligent <HI>Devil</HI> can bring his new Project in <HI>Poland</HI> to bear, as 'tis more than probable he will do &s;ome time or other, by the growing Zeal as well as Power of (that Hou&s;e of Bigots) the Hou&s;e of <HI>A&mdash;.</HI></P>

But to &s;um up the dull Story; we mu&s;t add in the Roll of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Conque&s;ts, the whole King|dom of <HI>France,</HI> where we have in one Year &s;een, to the immortal Glory of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Politicks, that his Mea&s;ures have prevailed to the total Extirpation of the Prote&s;tant Churches without a War; and that Intere&s;t which for 200 Years had &s;upported it &s;elf in &s;pight of Per&s;ecutions, Ma&s;&s;acres, five civil Wars and innumerable Bat|tles and Slaughters, at la&s;t receiv'd its mortal Wound from its own Champion <HI>Henry</HI> IV. and &s;unk into utter Oblivion, by <HI>Satan</HI>'s mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Management under the Agency of his two prime Mini&s;ters Cardinal <HI>Richlieu</HI> and <HI>Lewis</HI> the XIV. whom he entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Thus far we have a melancholy View of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s new Conque&s;ts, and the Ground he has re|gain'd upon the Reformation, in which his &s;e|cret Management has been &s;o exqui&s;ite, and his Politicks &s;o good, that could he bring but one Thing to pa&s;s, which by his own former Mi&s;take, (for the <HI>Devil</HI> is not infallible) he has rendred im|po&s;&s;ible, he would bring the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t &s;o near its Ruin, that Heaven would be, <HI>as it were,</HI> put to the Nece&s;&s;ity of working by Mira|cle to prevent it; <HI>the Ca&s;e is thus.</HI></P>
<P>Antient Hi&s;torians tell us, and from good Au|thority, that the DEVIL finding it for his Intere&s;t to bring his favourite <HI>Mahomet</HI> upon the Stage, and &s;pread the victorious Half-Moon upon the Ruin of the Cro&s;s, having with great Succe&s;s rais'd fir&s;t the <HI>Saracen</HI> Empire, and then the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> to &s;uch a Height, as that the Name of Chri&s;tian &s;eem|ed to be extirpated in tho&s;e two Quarters of the World, which were then not the greate&s;t only, but by far the mo&s;t powerful, I mean <HI>A&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Afri|ca;</HI> having totally laid wa&s;t all tho&s;e antient and flouri&s;hing Churches of <HI>Africa,</HI> the Labours of
<PB N="231" REF="241">
St. <HI>Cyprian, Tertullian,</HI> St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> and 670 Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hops and Fathers, who govern'd there at once, al&s;o all the Churches of <HI>Smyrna, Phila|delphia, Ephe&s;us, Sardis, Antioch, Laodicea,</HI> and innumerable others in <HI>Pontus, Bithynia,</HI> and the Provinces of the le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Devil</HI> having, I &s;ay, fini&s;h'd the&s;e Con|que&s;ts &s;o much to his Satisfaction, began to turn his Eyes Northward, and tho' he had a con&s;idera|ble Intere&s;t in the <HI>Whore of Babylon,</HI> and had brought his Power by the Subjection of the <HI>Roman</HI> Hierarchy to a great Height, yet finding the Intere&s;t of <HI>Mahomet</HI> mo&s;t &s;uitable to his <HI>devili&s;h</HI> Purpo&s;es, as mo&s;t adapted to the De&s;truction of Mankind, and laying wa&s;t the World, he re&s;olv'd to e&s;pou&s;e the growing Power of the <HI>Turk,</HI> and bring him in upon <HI>Europe</HI> like a Deluge.</P>
<P>In order to this, and to make Way for an ea&s;y Conque&s;t, like a true <HI>Devil</HI> he work'd under Ground, and &s;ap'd the Foundation of the Chri&s;ti|an Power, by &s;owing Di&s;cord among the reigning Princes of <HI>Europe;</HI> that &s;o envying one another they might be content to &s;tand &s;till and look on while the <HI>Turk</HI> devour'd them one by one, and at la&s;t might &s;wallow them up all.</P>
<P>This <HI>devili&s;h</HI> Policy took to his Heart's Con|tent; the Chri&s;tian Princes &s;tood &s;till, &s;tupid, dozing, and unconcern'd, till the Turk con|quered <HI>Thrace,</HI> over-run <HI>Servia, Macedonia, Bul|garia,</HI> and all the Remains of the <HI>Grecian</HI> Em|pire, and at la&s;t the Imperial City of <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>Finding this politic Method &s;o well an&s;wer his Ends, the <HI>Devil,</HI> who always improves upon the Succe&s;s of his own Experiments, re&s;olv'd from that time to lay a Foundation for the making tho&s;e Divi&s;ions and Jealou&s;ies of the Chri&s;ti|an Princes immortal; whereas they were at
<PB N="232" REF="242">
fir&s;t only per&s;onal, and founded in private Quar|rels between the Princes re&s;pectively; &s;uch as <HI>Emulation</HI> of one another's Glory, <HI>Envy</HI> at the extraordinary Valour, or other Merit of this or that Leader, or <HI>Revenge</HI> of &s;ome little Affront; for which notwith&s;tanding, &s;o great was the Piety of Chri&s;tian Princes in tho&s;e Days, that they made no Scruple to &s;acrifice whole Armies, yea Nations, to their Piques and private Quarrels, <HI>a certain Sign who&s;e Management they were under.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e being the Cau&s;es by which the DEVIL fir&s;t &s;ow'd the Seeds of Mi&s;chief among them, and the Succe&s;s &s;o well an&s;wering his De&s;ign, he could not but wi&s;h to have the &s;ame Advantage always ready at his Hand; and therefore he re&s;olv'd to order it &s;o, that the&s;e Divi&s;ions, which, how|ever u&s;eful to him, were only per&s;onal, and con|&s;equently temporary, like an Annual in the Gar|den, which mu&s;t be rais'd anew every Sea&s;on, might for the future be national and con&s;equently durable and immortal.</P>
<P>To this End it was nece&s;&s;ary to lay the Foundati|on of eternal Feud, not in the Humours and Pa&s;|&s;ions of Men only, but in the Intere&s;ts of Nations: The Way to do this was to form and &s;tate the Do|minion of tho&s;e Princes, by &s;uch a Plan drawn in Hell, and laid out from a Scheme truly political, of which the <HI>Devil</HI> was chief Engineer; that the Divi&s;ions &s;hould always remain, being made a natural Con&s;equence of the Situation of the Country, the Temper of their People, the Na|ture of their Commerce, the Climate, the Man|ner of living, or &s;omething which &s;hould for ever render it impo&s;&s;ible for them to unite.</P>
<P>This, I &s;ay, was a Scheme truly infernal, in which the <HI>Devil</HI> was as certainly the principal Ope|rator, to illu&s;trate great Things by &s;mall, as ever <HI>John</HI> of <HI>Leyden</HI> was of the High <HI>Dutch</HI> Rebellion, or
<PB N="233" REF="243">
Sir <HI>John B&mdash;t</HI> of the late Project, called the <HI>South-Sea</HI> Stock. Nor did this Contrivance of the <HI>Devil</HI> at all di&s;honour its Author, or the Succe&s;s appear unworthy of the Undertaker; for we &s;ee it not only an&s;wer the End, and made the <HI>Turk</HI> victorious at the &s;ame time, and formidable to <HI>Europe</HI> ever after, but it works to this Day, the Foundation of the Divi&s;ions remains in all the &s;everal Nations, and that to &s;uch a Degree that it is impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould unite.</P>
<P>This is what I hinted before, in which the <HI>Devil</HI> was mi&s;taken, and is another In&s;tance that he knows nothing of what's to come; for this very Foundation of immortal Jealou&s;y and Di&s;cord between the &s;everal Nations of <HI>Spain, France, Germany,</HI> and others, which the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf with &s;o much Policy contriv'd, and which &s;erv'd his Intere&s;ts &s;o long, is now the only Ob|&s;truction to his De&s;igns, and prevents the entire Ruin of the Reformation; for tho' the reform'd Countries are very powerful, and &s;ome of them, as <HI>Great Britain</HI> and <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> in particular, more powerful than ever; yet it cannot be &s;aid that the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;ts in general are &s;tronger than formerly, or &s;o &s;trong as they were in 1632, under the victorious Arms of the <HI>Swede;</HI> On the other hand, were it po&s;&s;ible that the Popi&s;h Powers, to wit, of <HI>France, Spain, Germany, Ita|ly</HI> and <HI>Poland,</HI> which are entirely Popi&s;h, could heartily unite their Intere&s;ts, and &s;hould join their Powers to attack the Prote&s;tants, the latter would find it very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to de|fend them&s;elves.</P>
<P>But as fatal as &s;uch a Union of the Popi&s;h Powers would be, and as u&s;eful as it would be to the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Cau&s;e at this time, not the <HI>Devil</HI> with all his Angels are able to bring it to pa&s;s; no, not with all his Craft and Cunning; he divided
<PB N="234" REF="244">
them, but he can't unite them; &s;o that even ju&s;t as 'tis with Men, &s;o 'tis with <HI>Devils,</HI> they may do in an Hour what they can't undo in an Age.</P>
<P>This may comfort tho&s;e faint-hearted Chri&s;ti|ans among us, who cry out of the Danger of a religious War in <HI>Europe,</HI> and what terrible Things will happen when <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> and <HI>Ger|many,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> and <HI>Poland</HI> &s;hall all unite; let this An&s;wer &s;atisfy them, The <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf can ne|ver make <HI>France</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> or <HI>France</HI> and the Emperor unite; jarring Humours may be recon|cil'd, but jarring Intere&s;ts never can: They may unite &s;o as to make a Peace, <HI>tho' that can hardly be long,</HI> but never &s;o as to make Conque&s;ts toge|ther; they are too much afraid of one another, for one to bear, that any Addition of Strength &s;hould come to the other. But this is a Digre&s;&s;ion. We &s;hall find the <HI>Devil</HI> mi&s;taken and di&s;appointed too on &s;everal other Occa&s;ions, as we go along.</P>
<P>I return to Satan's Intere&s;t in the &s;everal Go|vernments and Nations, by vertue of his Invi&s;i|bility, and which he carries on by Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; 'tis by this Invi&s;ibility that he pre&s;ides in all the Councils of <HI>foreign Powers,</HI> (for we never mean our own, that we always premi&s;e;) and what tho' it is alledged by the Criticks, that he does not pre&s;ide, becau&s;e there is always a Pre&s;ident; I &s;ay, if he is not in the Pre&s;ident's Chair, yet if he be in the Pre&s;ident him&s;elf, the Difference is not much; and if he does not vote as a Coun|&s;ellor, if he votes in the Coun&s;ellor, 'tis much the &s;ame; and here, as it was in the Story of <HI>Ahab</HI> the King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as he was a <HI>lying Spirit</HI> in the Mouths of <HI>all his Prophets;</HI> &s;o we find him a Spirit of &s;ome particular evil Quality or other, in all the Tran&s;actions and Tran&s;actors on that Stage of Life we call the State.</P>

Even B<HI>&mdash;B&mdash;</HI>him&s;elf, tho' all the World knows him to have a fooli&s;h <HI>Devil</HI> in him, would not have been Fool enough to have taken him into his Service, if he had known him: And my Lord <HI>Simpleton</HI> al&s;o, who <HI>Satan</HI> has &s;et up for a cunning Fool, &s;eems to have it &s;it much better upon him now he pa&s;&s;es for a Fool of Art, than it would have done if the naked DEVIL had come and challenged him for a Fool in Nature.</P>
<P>Infinite Variety illu&s;trate the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Reign among the Sons of Men; all which he manages with admirable Dexterity, and a Slight particular to him&s;elf, by the mere Advantage of his pre&s;ent conceal'd Situation, and which, had he been ob|liged to have appear'd in Publick, had been all lo&s;t, and he capable of ju&s;t nothing at all, or at lea&s;t of nothing more than the other ordinary Po|liticians of Wickedne&s;s could have done without him.</P>
<P>Now, Authors are much divided as to the man|ner how the <HI>Devil</HI> manages his proper In&s;tru|ments for Mi&s;chief; for Satan has a great many Agents in the Dark, who neither have the DEVIL in them, nor are they much acquainted with him, and yet he &s;erves him&s;elf of them, whether of their Folly, or of that other Frailty call'd Wit, 'tis all one, he makes them do his Work, when

they think they are doing their own; nay, &s;o cunning is he in his guiding the weak Part of the World, that even when they think they are &s;erving God, they are doing nothing le&s;s or more than &s;erving the <HI>Devil;</HI> nay, 'tis &s;ome of the nice&s;t Part of his Operation, to make them be|lieve they are &s;erving God, when they do his Work. Thus tho&s;e who the Scripture foretold &s;hould per&s;ecute Chri&s;t's Church in the latter Days, were to think they did God <HI>good Service:</HI> Thus the Inqui&s;ition, (for Example,) it may be, at this time, in all the Acts of Chri&s;tian Cruelty which they are &s;o famous for (if any of them are ignorant enough not to know that they are <HI>De|vils</HI> incarnate) they may, for ought we know, go on for God's &s;ake; torture, murther, &s;tarve to Death, mangle and macerate, and all for God, and God's Catholic Church; and 'tis certainly the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Ma&s;ter-piece to bring Mankind to &s;uch a Perfection of Devili&s;m as that of the <HI>In|qui&s;ition</HI> is; for <HI>if the</HI> Devil <HI>had not been in them,</HI> could they chri&s;ten &s;uch a <HI>Hell-&s;ire</HI> Judicature as the <HI>Inqui&s;ition</HI> is, by the Name of <HI>the Holy Of|fice?</HI> And &s;o in Pagani&s;m, how could &s;o many Nations among the poor <HI>Indians</HI> offer human Sa|crifices to their Idols, and murther thou&s;ands of Men, Women and Children, to appea&s;e this God of the Air, when he is angry, if the <HI>Devil</HI> did not act in them under the Vizor of Devotion?</P>
<P>But we need not go to <HI>America,</HI> or to the In|qui&s;ition, not to Pagani&s;m or to Popery either, to look for People that are &s;acrificing to the <HI>Devil,</HI> or that give their Peace-offerings to him, while they are offer'd upon God's Altar; are not our Churches (ay, and Meeting-hou&s;es too, as much as they pretend to be more &s;anctified than their Neighbours) full of <HI>Devil</HI> Wor&s;hipers?

<P>Do not the Sons of God make A&s;&s;ignations with the Daughters of Men in the very Hou&s;e of Wor&s;hip? Do they not talk to them in the Language of the Eyes? And what is at the Bot|tom of it, while one Eye is upon the Prayer|book, and the other adju&s;ting their Dre&s;s? Are they not &s;acrificing to <HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mercury,</HI> nay, and to the very <HI>Devil</HI> they dre&s;s at.</P>
<P>Let any Man impartially &s;urvey the Church-Ge&s;tures, the Air, the Po&s;tures and the Behavi|our; let him keep an exact Roll, and if I do not &s;hew him two <HI>Devil</HI> Wor&s;hipers for one true Saint, then the Word <HI>Saint</HI> mu&s;t have another Signification than I ever yet under&s;tood it by.</P>
<P>The Church (as a Place) is the Receptacle of the Dead, as well as the A&s;&s;embly of the Living; what relates to tho&s;e below, I doubt Satan, if he would be &s;o kind, could give a better Account of than I can; but as to the Superficies, I pre|tend to &s;o much Penetration as to tell you, that there are more Spectres, more Apparitions always there, than you that know nothing of the matter may be aware of.</P>

<P>This is the Ca&s;e indeed, and Satan carries his Point on every Hand; for if the fair &s;peaking World, and the fair looking World are general|ly <HI>Devils,</HI> that is to &s;ay, are in his Management,

<P>But I return to the <HI>Devil</HI>'s managing our wicked Part, for this he does with mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Subtilty; and this is one Part of it, <HI>(viz.)</HI> he thru&s;ts our Vi|ces into our Virtues, by which he mixes the Clean and the Unclean, and thus by the Corruption of the one poi&s;ons and debauches the other, &s;o that the Slave he governs cannot account for his own common Actions, and is fain to be oblig'd to his Maker to accept of the Heart without the Hands and Feet; to take, as we vulgarly expre&s;s it, <HI>the Will</HI> for the <HI>Deed;</HI> and if Heaven was not &s;o good to come into that half in half Service, I don't &s;ee but the <HI>Devil</HI> would carry away all his Servants: Here indeed I &s;hould enter into a long Detail of involuntary Wickedne&s;s, which in &s;hort, is neither more or le&s;s than the <HI>Devil</HI> in every Body, ay, in every one of you, (our Go|vernors excepted) take it as you plea&s;e.</P>
<P>What is our Language when we look back with Reflection and Reproach on pa&s;t Follies? <HI>I think I was bewitch'd,</HI> I was <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, certainly the Devil was in me, or el&s;e I had never been &s;uch a Sot: Devil</HI> in you, Sir!

<P>In &s;hort, the <HI>Devil</HI> is too cunning for us, and manages us his own Way; he governs the Vices of Men by his own Methods; tho' every Crime will not make a Man a <HI>Devil,</HI> yet it mu&s;t be own|ed that every Crime puts the Criminal in &s;ome Mea&s;ure into the Devil's Power, gives him a Ti|tle
<PB N="242" REF="252">
to the Man, and he treats him magi&s;terially ever after.</P>
<P>Some tell us every &s;ingle Man, every indivi|dual has a <HI>Devil</HI> attending him, to execute the Or|ders of the (Grand Signior) Devil of the whole Clan; that this attending <HI>evil Angel,</HI> for &s;o he is call'd, &s;ees every Step you take, is with you in every Action, prompts you to every Mi&s;chief, and leaves you to do every Thing that is pernicious to your&s;elf; they al&s;o alledge that there is a good Spirit which attends him too, which latter is always acce&s;&s;ary to every Thing that we do that is good, and re|luctant to evil; If this is true, how comes it to pa&s;s that tho&s;e two oppo&s;ite Spirits do not quar|rel about it when they are pre&s;&s;ing us to contrary Actions, one good and the other evil? and why does the evil tempting Spirit &s;o often prevail? In&s;tead of an&s;wering this difficult Que&s;tion, I &s;hall only tell you, as to this Story of good and evil Angels attending every particular Per&s;on, 'tis a good Allegory indeed to repre&s;ent the Struggle in the Mind of Man between good and evil Incli|nations; but as to the re&s;t, the be&s;t Thing I can &s;ay of it is, <HI>that</HI> I think <HI>'tis a Fib.</HI></P>
<P>But to take Things as they are, and only talk by way of natural Con&s;equence, for to argue from Nature is certainly the be&s;t Way to find out the <HI>Devil's</HI> Story; If there are good and evil Spirits attending us, that is to &s;ay, a good Angel and a <HI>Devil,</HI> then 'tis no unju&s;t Reproach upon any Body to &s;ay, when they follow the Dictates of the latter, the <HI>Devil</HI> is in them; or they are <HI>Devils;</HI> nay, I mu&s;t carry it farther &s;till, namely, that as the Generality and greate&s;t Number of People do follow and obey the evil Spirit and not the good, and that the predominate Power is al|low'd to be the nominating Power; you mu&s;t then allow, that in &s;hort, the greater Part of Man|kind

<P>I Have adjourn'd, not fini&s;h'd, my Account of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s &s;ecret Management by <HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,</HI> and &s;hall rea&s;&s;ume it, in its Place; but I mu&s;t take leave to mention &s;ome other Parts of his retir'd Scheme by which he has hitherto manag'd Man|kind, and the fir&s;t of the&s;e is by that Fraud of all Frauds call'd Oracle.</P>
<P>Here his Trumpet yielded an uncertain Sound for &s;ome Ages, and like what he was, and accord|ing to what he practi&s;ed from the Beginning, he de|liver'd out Fal&s;hood and Delu&s;ion by Retale: The Prie&s;ts of <HI>Apollo</HI> acted this Farce for him to a great Nicety at <HI>Delphos;</HI> there were divers others at the &s;ame Time, and &s;ome, which to give the Devil his due, he had very little Hand in, as we &s;hall &s;ee pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>There were al&s;o &s;ome &s;maller &s;ome greater, &s;ome more &s;ome le&s;s, famous Places where tho&s;e Oracles were &s;eated, and Audience given to the Enquirers, in all which the <HI>Devil</HI> or &s;ome Body for him, <HI>Per|mi&s;&s;u Superiorum,</HI> for either vindictive or other hidden Ends and Purpo&s;es, was allow'd to make at lea&s;t a Preten&s;ion to the Knowledge of Things to come; but, as public Cheats generally do, they acted in Ma&s;querade, and gave &s;uch uncertain and incon&s;i&s;tent Re&s;pon&s;es, that they were oblig'd
<PB N="246" REF="256">
to u&s;e the utmo&s;t Art to reconcile Events to the Prediction, even after things were come to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Here the <HI>Devil</HI> was a <HI>lying Spirit,</HI> in a parti|cular and extraordinary Manner, in the Mouths of all the Prophets; and yet he had the Cunning to expre&s;s him&s;elf &s;o, that whatever happen'd, the Oracle was &s;uppo&s;ed to have meant as it fell out; and &s;o all their Augurs, Omens and Voices, by which the <HI>Devil</HI> amus'd the World, not at that Time only, but &s;ince, have been likewi&s;e inter|preted.</P>
<P><HI>Julian</HI> the Apo&s;tate dealt mightily in the&s;e A|mu&s;ements, but the <HI>Devil,</HI> who neither $i&s;h'd his Fall, or pre&s;ag'd it to him, evidenc'd that he knew nothing of <HI>Julian</HI>'s Fate; for that, as he &s;ent almo&s;t to all the Oracles of the Ea&s;t, and &s;ummon'd all the Prie&s;ts together to inform him of the Succe&s;s of his <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Expedition, they all, like <HI>Ahab</HI>'s <HI>Prophets,</HI> having a lying Spirit in them, encourag'd him and promis'd him Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>Nay, all the ill Omens which di&s;turb'd him, they pre&s;ag'd good from; <HI>for Example,</HI> he was at a prodigious Expence when he was at <HI>Antioch</HI> to buy up white Bea&s;ts, and white Fowls, for Sa|crifices, and for Predicting from the Entrails; from whence the <HI>Antiochians,</HI> in Contempt, call'd him <HI>Victimarius;</HI> but whenever the Entrails fore|boded Evil, the cunning <HI>Devil</HI> made the Prie&s;ts put a different Con&s;truction upon them, and pro|mi&s;e him Good: When he entred into the Temple of the <HI>Genij</HI> to offer Sacrifice, one of the Prie&s;ts dropt down dead; this, had it had any Signification more than a Man falling dead of an Apoplectic, would have &s;ignified &s;omething fatal to <HI>Julian,</HI> who made him&s;elf a Brother Sa|cri&s;t or Prie&s;t; whereas the Prie&s;ts turn'd it pre|&s;ently to &s;ignify the Death of his Colleague, the Con&s;ul <HI>Sallu&s;t,</HI> which happen'd ju&s;t at the &s;ame
<PB N="247" REF="257">
Time, tho' eight hundred Miles off; &s;o in ano|ther Ca&s;e, <HI>Julian</HI> thought it ominous that he, who was <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> &s;hould be nam'd with two other Names of Per&s;ons, both already dead; the Ca&s;e was thus, the Stile of the Emperor was <HI>Juli|anus Foelix Augu&s;tus,</HI> and two of his principal Of|ficers were <HI>Julianus</HI> and <HI>Foelix;</HI> now both <HI>Julianus</HI> and <HI>Foelix</HI> died within a few Days of one another, which di&s;turb'd Him much, who was the third of the three Names; but his flattering <HI>Devil</HI> told him it all imported Good to him <HI>(viz.)</HI> that tho' <HI>Julianus</HI> and <HI>Foelix</HI> &s;hould die, <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> &s;hould be immortal.</P>
<P>Thus whatever happen'd, and whatever was foretold, and how much &s;oever they differ'd from one another, the lying Spirit was &s;ure to recon|cile the <HI>Prediction</HI> and the <HI>Event,</HI> and make them at lea&s;t &s;eem to corre&s;pond in Favour of the Per&s;on enquiring.</P>
<P>Now we are told Oracles are cea&s;ed, and the <HI>Devil</HI> is farther limited for the Good of Mankind, not being allow'd to vent his Delu&s;ions by the Mouths of the Prie&s;ts and Augurs, as formerly: I will not take upon me to &s;ay how far they are really ceas'd, more than they were before; I think 'tis much more rea&s;onable to believe there was never any Reality in them at all, or that any Ora|cle ever gave out any An&s;wers but what were the Invention of the Prie&s;ts and the Delu&s;ions of the DEVIL; I have a great many antient Authors on my Side in this Opinion, as <HI>Eu&s;ebius, Tertullian, Ari&s;totle,</HI> and others, who as they liv'd &s;o near the Pagan Times, and when even &s;ome of tho&s;e Rites were yet in U&s;e, they had much more Rea&s;on to know, and could probably pa&s;s a better Judgment upon them; nay <HI>Cicero</HI> him&s;elf ridicules them in the opene&s;t Manner; again other Authors de|&s;cend to Particulars, and &s;hew how the Cheat was
<PB N="248" REF="258">
manag'd by the Heathen Sacri&s;ts and Prie&s;ts, and in what enthu&s;ia&s;tic Manner they &s;poke; namely, by going into the hollow Images, &s;uch as the bra|zen Bull and the Image of <HI>Apollo;</HI> and how &s;ub|tilly they gave out <HI>dubious</HI> and <HI>ambiguous</HI> An&s;wers; that when the People did not find their Expecta|tions an&s;wer'd by the Event, they might be im|po&s;ed upon by the Prie&s;ts, and confidently told they did not rightly under&s;tand the Oracle's Meaning: However, I cannot &s;ay but that indeed there are &s;ome Authors of good Credit too, who will have it that there was a real prophetic Spi|rit in the Voice or An&s;wers given by the Ora|cles, and that oftentimes they were miraculou&s;|ly exact in tho&s;e An&s;wers; and they give that of the <HI>Delphic</HI> Oracle an&s;wering the Que&s;tion which was given about <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> for an Example, <HI>viz.</HI> what <HI>Croe&s;us</HI> was doing at that time? <HI>to wit,</HI> that he was boiling a Lamb and the Fle&s;h of a Tor|toi&s;e together, in a bra&s;s Ve&s;&s;el, or Boiler, with a Cover of the &s;ame Metal; that is to &s;ay, in a Kettle with a bra&s;s Cover.</P>
<P>To affirm therefore, that they were all Cheats, a Man mu&s;t encounter with Antiquity, and for his private Judgment up again&s;t an e&s;tabli&s;h'd O|pinion; but 'tis no matter for that; if I do not &s;ee any thing in that receiv'd Opinion capable of E|vidence, much le&s;s of Demon&s;tration, I mu&s;t be allow'd &s;till to think as I do; others may believe as they li&s;t; I &s;ee nothing hard or difficult in the Thing; the Prie&s;ts, who were always hi&s;to|rically inform'd of the Circum&s;tances of the En|quirer, or at lea&s;t &s;omething about them, might ea&s;ily find &s;ome ambiguous Speech to make, and put &s;ome double Entendre upon them, which upon the Event &s;olv'd the Credit of the Oracle, were it one way or other; and this they certainly did, or we have room to think the DEVIL knows

le&s;s of Things now than he did in former Days.</P>
<P>It is true that by the&s;e Delu&s;ions the Prie&s;ts got infinite Sums of Money, and this makes it &s;till probable that they would labour hard, and u&s;e the utmo&s;t of their Skill to uphold the Cre|dit of their Oracles; and 'tis a full Di&s;covery, as well of the Subtlety of the Sacri&s;ts, as of the Ig|norance and Stupidity of the People, in tho&s;e early Days of <HI>Satan</HI>'s Witchcraft; to &s;ee what merry Work the <HI>Devil</HI> made with the World, and what gro&s;s Things he put upon Mankind: Such was the Story of the <HI>Dordonian</HI> Oracle in <HI>Epirus, viz.</HI> That two <HI>Pigeons</HI> flew out of <HI>Thebes (N.

<P>Wi&s;e <HI>Cicero</HI> contemned all this, and, as Authors tell us, ridiculed the An&s;wer which, as I have hinted above, the Oracle gave to <HI>Croe&s;us,</HI> prov|ing that the Oracle it &s;elf was a <HI>Lye;</HI> that it cou'd not come from <HI>Apollo,</HI> for that <HI>Apollo</HI> ne|ver &s;poke <HI>Latin:</HI> In a word, <HI>Cicero</HI> rejected them all, and <HI>Demo&s;thenes</HI> al&s;o mentions the Cheats of the <HI>Oracles;</HI> when &s;peaking of the Oracle of <HI>A|pollo,</HI> he &s;aid, <HI>Pithia Philippiz'd;</HI> that is, that
<PB N="250" REF="260">
when the Prie&s;ts were brib'd with Money, they always gave their An&s;wers in favour of <HI>Philip</HI> of <HI>Macedon.</HI></P>
<P>But that which is mo&s;t &s;trange to me is, that in this Di&s;pute about the Reality of Oracles, the Heathen who made u&s;e of them are the People who expo&s;e them, and who in&s;i&s;t mo&s;t po&s;itively upon their being Cheats and Impo&s;tors, as in par|ticular tho&s;e mentioned above; while the Chri&s;|tians who reject them, yet believe they did really foretel Things, an&s;wer Que&s;tions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> on|ly with this Difference, that the Heathen Authors who oppo&s;e them, in&s;i&s;t th$$ 'tis all Delu&s;ion and Cheat, and charge it upon the Prie&s;ts; and the Chri&s;tian Oppo&s;ers in&s;i&s;t that it was real, but that the <HI>Devil,</HI> not the Gods, gave the An&s;wers; and that he was permitted to do it by a &s;uperior Power, to magnify that Power in the total &s;i|lencing them at la&s;t.</P>
<P>But, as I &s;aid before, I am with the Heathen here, again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Writers, for I take it all to be a Cheat and Delu&s;ion: I mu&s;t give my Rea&s;on for it, or I do nothing; my Rea&s;on is this, I in&s;i&s;t Satan is as blind in Matters of Futurity, as we are, and can tell nothing of what is to come; the&s;e Oracles often pretend|ing to predict, could be nothing el&s;e therefore but a Cheat form'd by the Money-getting Prie&s;ts to amu&s;e the World, and bring Gri&s;t to their Mill: If I meet with any thing in my Way to open my Eyes to a better Opinion of them, I &s;hall tell it you as I go on.</P>
<P>On the other hand, whether the <HI>Devil</HI> really &s;pake in tho&s;e Oracles, or &s;et the cunning Prie&s;ts to &s;peak for him; whether they predicted, or only made the People believe they predicted; whether they gave An&s;wers which came to pa&s;s, or prevail'd upon the People to believe that
<PB N="251" REF="261">
what was &s;aid did come to pa&s;s, it was much at one, and fully an&s;wer'd the <HI>Devil</HI>'s End; namely, to amu&s;e and delude the World; and as to do, or to cau&s;e to be done, is the &s;ame Part of Speech, &s;o whoever did it, the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Intere&s;t was car|ried on by it, his Government pre&s;erv'd, and all the Mi&s;chief he could de&s;ire was effectually brought to pa&s;s, &s;o that every way they were the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Oracles, that's out of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Indeed I have wonder'd &s;ometimes why, &s;ince by this Sorcery the <HI>Devil</HI> perform'd &s;uch Won|ders, that is, play'd &s;o many Tricks in the World, and had &s;uch univer&s;al Succe&s;s, he &s;hould &s;et up no more of them; but there might be a great many Rea&s;ons given for that, too long to tire you with at pre&s;ent: 'Tis true, there were not many of them, and yet con&s;idering what a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s they di&s;patch'd, it was enough, for &s;ix or eight Oracles were more than &s;ufficient to a|mu&s;e all the World: The chief Oracles we meet with in Hi&s;tory are among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and the <HI>Ro|mans, viz.</HI></P>

<P>This Tale tells but indifferently, tho' indeed it looks more like <HI>a Chri&s;tian Fable,</HI> than a Pa|gan; becau&s;e it &s;eems as if made to honour the Chri&s;tian Wor&s;hip, and bla&s;t all the Pagan Ido|latry; and for that Rea&s;on I reject it, the Chri&s;|tian Profe&s;&s;ion needing no &s;uch fabulous Stuff to confirm it.</P>
<P>Nor is it true in fact, that the Oracles did cea&s;e immediately upon the Death of Chri&s;t; but, as I noted before, the Sum of the Matter is this; the Chri&s;tian Religion &s;preading it &s;elf univer&s;ally, as well as miraculou&s;ly, and that too <HI>by the Fooli&s;hne&s;s of Preaching,</HI> into all Parts of the World, the Oracles ceas'd; that is to &s;ay, their Trade ceas'd, their Rogueries were daily detected, the deluded People being better taught, came no more after them, and being a&s;ham'd, as well as di&s;courag'd, they &s;neak'd out of the World as well as they could; in &s;hort the Cu&s;|tomers fell off, and the Prie&s;ts, who were the Shopkeepers, having no Bu&s;ine&s;s to do, &s;hut up their Shops, Broke, and went away; the Trade and the Trade&s;men were hi&s;s'd off the Stage toge|ther; &s;o that the <HI>Devil,</HI> who, it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, got infinitely by the Cheat, became bankrupt, and was oblig'd to &s;et other Engines at work, as other Cheats and Deceivers do, who when one Trick grows &s;tale, and will &s;erve no longer, are forc'd to try another.</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="263">
Nor was the <HI>Devil</HI> to &s;eek of new Mea&s;ures; for tho' he could not give out his delu&s;ive Tra&s;h as he did before, in Pomp and State, with the Solemnity of a Temple and a Set of Enthu&s;ia&s;ts call'd Prie&s;ts, who plaid a thou&s;and Tricks to amu&s;e the World, he then had Recour&s;e to his old <HI>Egyptian</HI> Method, which indeed was more antient than that of Oracles; and that was by Magic, Sorcery, Familiars, Witchcraft, and the like.</P>
<P>Of this we find the People of the <HI>South,</HI> that is, of <HI>Arabia</HI> and <HI>Chaldea</HI> were the fir&s;t, from whence we are told the Wi&s;e Men, that is to &s;ay, Magicians, were call'd <HI>Caldeans</HI> and <HI>South|&s;ayers.</HI> Hence al&s;o we find <HI>Ahaziah</HI> the King of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> &s;ent to <HI>Baalzebub</HI> the God of <HI>Ekron,</HI> to enquire whether he &s;hould live or die? This &s;ome think was a kind of an Oracle, tho' others think it was only &s;ome over-grown Magician, who counterfeited him&s;elf to be a <HI>Devil,</HI> and obtain'd upon that Idol-hunting Age to make a Cunning Man of him; and for that Purpo&s;e he got him|&s;elf made the Prie&s;t of <HI>Baalzebub,</HI> the God of <HI>Ekron,</HI> and gave out An&s;wers in his Name. Thus tho&s;e merry Fellows in <HI>Egypt, Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres,</HI> are &s;aid to mimick <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> and <HI>Aaron,</HI> when they work'd the miraculous Plagues upon the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> and we have &s;ome In&s;tances in Scripture that &s;upport this, &s;uch as the Witch of <HI>Endor,</HI> the King <HI>Mana&s;&s;es,</HI> who dealt with the <HI>Devil</HI> openly, and had a Familiar; the Woman mentioned <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. who had a Spirit of <HI>Divi|nation,</HI> and who got Money by playing the Ora|cle; that is, an&s;wering doubtful Que&s;tions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which Spirit, or <HI>Devil,</HI> the Apo&s;tle ca&s;t out.</P>
<P>Now tho' it is true that the old Women in the World have fill'd us with Tales, &s;ome improba|ble, others impo&s;&s;ible; &s;ome weak, &s;ome ridicu|lous, and that this puts a general Di&s;credit upon all
<PB N="254" REF="264">
the graver Matrons, who entertain us with Sto|ries better put together; yet 'tis certain, and I mu&s;t be allow'd to affirm, that the <HI>Devil</HI> does not di&s;dain to take into his Service many Troops of good <HI>Old Women,</HI> and Old Women-Men too, who he finds 'tis for his Service to keep in con&s;tant Pay; to the&s;e he is found frequently to com|municate his Mind, and oftentimes we find them &s;uch Proficients, that they know much more than the <HI>Devil</HI> can teach them.</P>
<P>How far our antient Friend <HI>Merlin,</HI> or the grave Matron his (Satan's) mo&s;t tru&s;ty and well|beloved Cou&s;in and Coun&s;ellor, Mother <HI>Shipton,</HI> were commi&s;&s;ioned by him to give out their pro|phetic Oracles, and what degree of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion he may have arrived to in them upon their Midnight Excur&s;ions, I will not undertake to prove; but that he might be acquainted with them both, as well as with &s;everal of our modern Gentlemen, I will not deny neither.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s it is not very incongruous with the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Temper, or with the Nature of his Bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;hift hands; po&s;&s;ibly he found that he had tired the World with Oracular Cheats; that Men began to be &s;urfeited with them, and grew &s;ick of the Frauds which were &s;o fre|quently detected; that it was time to take new Mea&s;ures, and contrive &s;ome new Trick to Bite the World, that he might not be expos'd to Con|tempt; or perhaps he &s;aw the Approach of new Light, which the Chri&s;tian Doctrine bringing with it began to &s;pread in the Minds of Men; that it would out-&s;hine the dim burning <HI>i$$i fatui,</HI> with which he had &s;o long cheated Man-kind, and was afraid to &s;tand it, le&s;t he &s;hould be mobb'd off the Stage by his own People, when their Eyes &s;hould begin to open: That upon this foot he might in Policy withdraw from tho&s;e old

Retreats the Oracles, and re&s;train tho&s;e Re&s;pon&s;es before they lo&s;t all their Credit; for we find the People &s;eem'd to be at a mighty Lo&s;s for &s;ome time, for want of them, &s;o that it made them run up and down to Conjurers, and <HI>Man-Go&s;&s;ips,</HI> to brazen Heads, &s;peaking Calves, and innume|rable &s;imple Things, &s;o gro&s;s that they are &s;carce fit to be named, to &s;atisfy the Itch of having their Fortunes told them, as we call it.</P>
<P>Now as the DEVIL is very &s;eldom blind to his own Intere&s;t, and therefore thought fit to quit his old way of impo&s;ing upon the World by his Oracles, only becau&s;e he found the World began to be too wi&s;e to be impo&s;ed upon that way; &s;o on the other hand, finding there was &s;till a Po&s;|&s;ibility to delude the World, tho' by other In|&s;truments, he no &s;ooner laid down his Oracles, and the &s;olemn Pageantry, magnificent Appear|ances, and other Frauds of his Prie&s;ts and Vota|ries, in their Temples and Shrines; but he &s;et up a new Trade, and having, as I have &s;aid, Agents and In&s;truments &s;ufficient for any Bu&s;ine&s;s that he could have to employ them in, he begins in Cor|ners, as the learned and merry Dr. <HI>Brown</HI> &s;ays, and exerci&s;es his minor Trumperies by ways of his own contriving, li&s;ting a great Number of new-found Operators, &s;uch as Witches, Magi|cians, Diviners, Figure-ca&s;ters, A&s;trologers, and &s;uch inferior Seducers.</P>
<P>Now it is true, as that Doctor &s;ays, this was running into Corners, as if he had been expell'd his more triumphant way of giving Audience in Form, which for &s;o many Ages had been allow'd him; yet I mu&s;t add, that as it &s;eem'd to be the DEVIL's own doing, from a right Judgment of his Affairs, which had taken a new Turn in the World, upon the &s;hining of new Lights from the Chri&s;tian Doctrine, &s;o it mu&s;t be acknow|ledged
<PB N="259" REF="266">
the <HI>Devil</HI> made him&s;elf amends upon Man|kind, by the various Methods he took, and the Multitude of In&s;truments he employ'd, and per|haps deluded Mankind in a more fatal and &s;en&s;i|ble manner than he did before, tho' not &s;o uni|ver&s;ally.</P>
<P>He had indeed before more Pomp and Figure put upon it, and he cheated Mankind then in a Way of Magnificence and Splendor; but this was not in above eight or ten principal Places, and not fifty Places in all, public or private; whereas now fifty thou&s;and of his Angels and In&s;truments, vi&s;ible and invi&s;ible, hardly may be &s;aid to &s;uffice for one Town or City; but in &s;hort, as his invi|&s;ible Agents fill the Air, and are at hand for Mi&s;|chief on every Emergence, &s;o his vi&s;ible Fools &s;warm in every Village, and you have &s;carce a Hamlet or a Town but his Emi&s;&s;aries are at Hand for Bu&s;ine&s;s; and which is &s;till wor&s;e, in all Pla|ces he finds Bu&s;ine&s;s, nay even where Religion is planted and &s;eems to flouri&s;h, yet he keeps his Ground and pu&s;hes his Intere&s;t according to what has been &s;aid el&s;ewhere upon the &s;ame Subject, that wherever Religion plants, the Devil plants clo&s;e by it.</P>
<P>Nor, as I &s;ay, does he fail of Succe&s;s, Delu&s;ion &s;preads like a Plague, and the Devil is &s;ure of Vo|taries; like a true Mountebank, he can always bring a Croud about his Stage, and that &s;ome Times fa&s;ter than other People.</P>
<P>What I ob&s;erve upon this Subject is this, that the World is at a &s;trange Lo&s;s for want of the Devil; if it was not &s;o, what's the Rea&s;on, that upon the &s;ilencing the Oracles, and Religion tell|ing them that Miracles are ceas'd, and that God has done &s;peaking by Prophets, they never enquire whether Heaven has e&s;tabli&s;h'd any other or new Way of Revelation, but away they ran with

their Doubts and Difficulties to the&s;e Dreamers of Dreams, Tellers of Fortunes, and per&s;onal Oracles to be re&s;olv'd; as if when they acknow|ledge the Devil is dumb, the&s;e could &s;peak; and as if the wicked Spirit could do more than the Good, the <HI>Diabolical</HI> more than the <HI>Divine,</HI> or that Heaven having taken away the DEVIL's Voice, had furni&s;h'd him with an Equivalent, by allowing Scolds, Termagants, and old weak and &s;uperannuated Wretches to &s;peak for him; for the&s;e are the People we go to now in our Doubts and Emergencies.</P>
<P>While this Blindne&s;s continues among us, 'tis Non&s;en&s;e to &s;ay that Oracles are &s;ilenced, or the <HI>Devil</HI> is dumb, for the <HI>Devil</HI> gives Audience &s;till by his Deputies; only as <HI>Jeroboam</HI> made Prie&s;ts of the meane&s;t of the People, &s;o he is grown a little humble, and makes u&s;e of meaner In&s;tru|ments than he did before; for whereas the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Apollo,</HI> and of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> were &s;plendid in their Appearance, of grave and venerable A&s;pect, and &s;ometimes of no mean Quality; now he makes u&s;e of Scoundrels and Rabble, Beggars and Va|gabonds, old Hags, &s;uperannuated mi&s;crable Her|mits, Gyp&s;ies and Strollers, the Pictures of Envy and ill Luck.</P>
<P>Either the <HI>Devil</HI> is grown an ill Ma&s;ter, and gives but mean Wages, that he can get no better Servants; or el&s;e Common Sen&s;e is grown very low priz'd and contemptible; that &s;uch as the&s;e are fit Tools to continue the Succe&s;&s;ion of Fraud, and carry on the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Intere&s;t in the World: for were not the Pa&s;&s;ions and Temper of Man|kind deeply pre-engaged in favour of this dark Prince, we could never &s;uffer our &s;elves to accept of his Favours by the Hands of &s;uch contempti|ble Agents as the&s;e!

<P>Either the DEVIL u&s;es us more like Fools than he did our Ance&s;tors, or we really are wor&s;t Fools than tho&s;e Ages produced, for they were never deluded by &s;uch low-priz'd <HI>Devils</HI> as we are; by &s;uch de&s;picable <HI>Bridewell</HI> DEVILS, that are fitter for a Whipping-po&s;t than an Altar, and in&s;tead of being receiv'd as the Voice of an Ora|cle, &s;hould be &s;ent to the Hou&s;e of Correction for Pick-pockets.</P>
<P>Nor is this accidental, and here and there one of the&s;e Wretches to be &s;een, but in &s;hort, if it has been in other Nations as it is with us, I do not &s;ee that the DEVIL was able to get any better People into his Pay, or at lea&s;t very rarely: Where have we &s;een any thing above a Tinker turn Wizard? and where have we had a Witch of Quality a|mong us, Mother <HI>Je&mdash;gs</HI> excepted? and if the had not been more of &s;omething el&s;e than a Witch, 'twas thought &s;he had never got &s;o much Money by her Profe&s;&s;ion.</P>

<P>I have heard that in older Times, I &s;uppo&s;e in good Queen <HI>Be&s;s</HI>'s Days, or beyond, (for little is to be &s;aid here for any thing on this Side of her time) there were &s;ome Coun&s;ellors and State&s;men who merited the Character of <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> in the be&s;t Sen&s;e; that is to &s;ay, <HI>good,</HI> and <HI>wi&s;e,</HI> as they &s;tand in Conjunction; but as to what has hap|pen'd &s;ince that, or, as we may call it, from that Queen's Funeral to the late Revolution, I have little to &s;ay; but I'll tell you what hone&s;t <HI>An|drew Marvel</HI> &s;aid of tho&s;e Times, and by that you may, if you plea&s;e, make your Calculation or let it alone, 'tis all one.</P>

<P>Perhaps it is nece&s;&s;ary they &s;hould be thus ex|traordinary in their A&s;pect, that they might &s;trike an Awe into the Minds of their Votaries, as if they were Satan's true and real Repre&s;entatives; and that the &s;aid Votaries may think when they &s;peak to the Witches they are really talking to the <HI>Devil;</HI> or perhaps 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to the Witches them&s;elves, that they &s;hould be &s;o ex|qui&s;itely ugly, that they might not be &s;urpriz'd at whatever Figure the Devil makes when he fir&s;t appears to them, being certain they can &s;ee no|thing uglier than them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Some are of the Opinion that the Communica|tion with the <HI>Devil,</HI> or between the Devil and tho&s;e Creatures his Agents, has &s;omething a&s;|&s;imulating in it, and that if they were tolerable before, they are, <HI>ip&s;o facto,</HI> turn'd into DEVILS by talking with him; I will not &s;ay but that a

<P>But be it which of the&s;e the Enquirer plea&s;es, 'tis all one to the Ca&s;e in Hand; this is certain, that &s;uch deform'd <HI>Devil-like</HI> Creatures, mo&s;t of tho&s;e we call <HI>H$gs</HI> and <HI>Witches,</HI> are in their Shapes and A&s;pects, and that they give out their Senten|ces and frightful Me&s;&s;ages with an Air of Re|venge for &s;ome Injury receiv'd; for Witches are fam'd chiefly for doing Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>It &s;eems the <HI>Devil</HI> has always pick'd out the mo&s;t ugly and frightful old Women to do his Bu&s;ine&s;s; <HI>Mother Shipton,</HI> our famous <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Witch or Prophete&s;s, is very much wrong'd in her Picture, if &s;he was not of the mo&s;t terrible A&s;pect imaginable; and if it be true that <HI>Merlin,</HI> the famous <HI>Welch</HI> Fortune-Teller, was a fright|ful Figure, it will &s;eem the more rational to be|lieve, if we credit another Story, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that he was begotten by the Devil him&s;elf, of which I &s;hall &s;peak by it &s;elf: But to go back to the De|vil's In&s;truments being &s;o ugly; it may be ob|&s;erved, I &s;ay, that the Devil has always dealt in &s;uch &s;ort of Cattle; the <HI>Syblis,</HI> of whom &s;o many &s;trange prophetic Things are recorded, whether true or no is not to the Que&s;tion, are (if the <HI>Ita|lian</HI> Painters may have any Credit given them)

<P>As to the deriving his Gift of Prophe&s;y from the Devil, by that pretended Generation, I &s;hall omit that Part, becau&s;e, as I have all along in&s;i&s;|ted upon it, that Satan him&s;elf has no prophe|tic or predicting Powers of his own, it is not very clear to me that he could convey it to his Po&s;terity, <HI>nil dat quod not habet.</HI></P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI. <HI>Of the extraordinary Appearance of the</HI> Devil, <HI>and particularly of the Cloven-Foot.</HI></HEAD>
<P>SOme People would fain have us treat this Tale of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s appearing with a Cloven-Foot with more Solemnity than I believe the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf does; for Satan, who knows how much of a Cheat it is, mu&s;t certainly ridicule it, in his own Thoughts, to the la&s;t Degree; but as he is glad of any Way to hoodwink the Under|&s;tandings, and bubble the weak Part of the World; &s;o if he &s;ees Men willing to take every Scarecrow for a Devil, it is not his Bu&s;ine&s;s to undeceive them; on the other Hand, he finds it his In|tere&s;t to fo&s;ter the Cheat, and &s;erve him&s;elf of the Con&s;equence: Nor could I doubt but the De|vil, if any Mirth be allow'd him, often laughs at the many frightful Shapes and Figures we dre&s;s him up in, and e&s;pecially to &s;ee how willing we are fir&s;t to paint him as black, and make him ap|pear as ugly as we can, and then &s;tare and &s;tart at the Spectrum of our own making.</P>
<P>The Truth is, that among all the Horribles that we dre&s;s up Satan in, I cannot but think we &s;hew the lea&s;t of Invention in this of a Goat, or a Thing with a Goat's Foot, of all the re&s;t; for tho' a Goat is a Creature made u&s;e of by our Saviour in the Allegory of the Day of Judg|ment, and is &s;aid there to repre&s;ent the wicked rejected Party, yet it &s;eems to be only on Account of their Similitude to the Sheep, and &s;o to repre|&s;ent the ju&s;t Fate of Hypocri&s;y and Hypocrites, and in particular to form the nece&s;&s;ary Antithe|&s;is
<PB N="266" REF="276">
in the Story; for el&s;e, <HI>our whim&s;ical Fancies ex|cepted,</HI> a Sheep or a Lamb has a Cloven-Foot as well as a Goat; nay, if the Scripture be of any Value in the Ca&s;e, 'tis to the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Advantage, for the dividing the Hoof was the di&s;tingui&s;hing Character or Mark of a clean Bea&s;t, and how the Devil can be brought into that Number is pret|ty hard to &s;ay.</P>
<P>One would have thought if we had intended to have given a ju&s;t Figure of the <HI>Devil,</HI> it would have been more oppo&s;ite to have rank'd him a|mong the Cat-kind, and given him a Foot (if he is to be known by his Foot) like a Lion, or like a <HI>red Dragon,</HI> being the &s;ame Creatures which he is repre&s;ented by in the Text, and &s;o his Claws would have had &s;ome Terror in them as well as his Teeth.</P>
<P>But neither is the <HI>Goat</HI> a true Repre&s;entative of the Devil at all, for we do not rank the Goats among the &s;ubtle or cunning Part of the Brutes; he is counted a fierce Creature indeed of his Kind, tho' nothing like the&s;e other above mention'd; and he is emblematically u&s;ed to repre&s;ent a lu&s;tful Temper, but even that Part does not fully &s;erve to de&s;cribe the Devil, who&s;e Operation lies prin|cipally another Way.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides it is not the <HI>Goat</HI> him&s;elf that is made u&s;e of, 'tis the Cloven-Hoof only, and that &s;o particularly, that the <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> of a Ram or a Swine, or any other Creature, may &s;erve as well as that of a <HI>Goat,</HI> only that Hi&s;tory gives us &s;ome Cau&s;e to call it the <HI>Goat's Foot.</HI></P>
<P>In the next Place 'tis under&s;tood by us not as a bare Token to know <HI>Satan</HI> by, but as if it were a Brand upon him, and that like the Mark God put upon <HI>Cain,</HI> it was given him for a Puni&s;hment, &s;o that he cannot get leave to appear without it, nay cannot conceal it whatever other Dre&s;s or
<PB N="267" REF="277">
Di&s;gui&s;e he may put on; and as if it was to make him as ridiculous as po&s;&s;ible, they will have it be, that whenever <HI>Satan</HI> has Occa&s;ion to dre&s;s him|&s;elf in any humane Shape, be it of what Degree &s;oever, from the King to the Beggar, be it of a fine Lady or of an <HI>old Woman,</HI> (the Latter it &s;eems he oftene&s;t a&s;&s;umes) yet &s;till he not only mu&s;t have this <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> about him, but he is oblig'd to &s;hew it too; nay, they will not allow him any Dre&s;s, whether it be a Prince's Robes, a Lord Cha&mdash;r's Gown, or a Lady's Hoops and long Petticoats, but the Cloven-Foot mu&s;t be &s;hew'd from under them; they will not &s;o much as allow him an artifical <HI>Shoe</HI> or a <HI>Jack-Boot,</HI> as we often &s;ee contriv'd to conceal a <HI>Club-Foot</HI> or a <HI>Wooden-Leg;</HI> but that the <HI>Devil</HI> may be known where|ever he goes, he is bound to &s;hew his Foot; they might as well oblige him to &s;et a Bill upon his Cap, as Folks do upon a Hou&s;e to be let, and have it written in capital Letters, <HI>I am the</HI> DEVIL.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd this is very particular, and would be very hard upon the <HI>Devil,</HI> if it had not another Article in it, which is &s;ome Advantage to him, and that is, that <HI>the Fact is not true;</HI> but the Belief of this is &s;o univer&s;al, that all the World runs away with it; by which Mi&s;take the good People mi&s;s the <HI>Devil</HI> many times where they look for him, and meet him as often where they did not expect him, and when for want of this Cloven-Foot they do not know him.</P>
<P>Upon this very Account I have &s;ometimes thought, not that this has been put upon him by meer Fancy, and the Cheat of a heavy Imagination, propagated by Fable and Chymny-Corner Divi|nity, but that it has been a Contrivance of his own; and that, in &s;hort, the Devil rais'd this Scandal upon him&s;elf, that he might keep his Di&s;|gui&s;e the better, and might go a Vi&s;iting among
<PB N="268" REF="278">
his Friends without being known; for were it really &s;o, that he could go no where without this particular Brand of Infamy, he could not come into Company, could not dine with my Lord Mayor, nor drink Tea with the Ladies, could not go to the Drawing-R&mdash;at&mdash;, could not have gone to <HI>Fountainbleau</HI> to the King of <HI>France</HI>'s Wedding, or to the Diet of <HI>Poland,</HI> to prevent the Grandees there coming to an Agree|ment; nay, <HI>which would be &s;till wor&s;e than all,</HI> he could not go to the Ma&s;querade, nor to any of our Balls; the Rea&s;on is plain, he would be al|ways di&s;cover'd, expos'd and forc'd to leave the good Company, or which would be as bad, the Company would all cry out the <HI>Devil</HI> and run out of the Room as if they were frighted; nor could all the Help of Invention do him any Ser|vice, no Dre&s;s he could put on would cover him; not all our Friends at <HI>Tavi&s;tock Corner</HI> could fur|ni&s;h him with a Habit that would di&s;gui&s;e or con|ceal him, this unhappy Foot would &s;poil it all: Now this would be &s;o great a Lo&s;s to him, that I que&s;tion whether he could carry on any of his mo&s;t important Affairs in the World without it; for tho' he has acce&s;s to Mankind in his compleat Di&s;gui&s;e, I mean that of his Invi&s;ibility, yet the Learned very much agree in this, that his corpo|ral Pre&s;ence in the World is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary upon many Occa&s;ions, to &s;upport his Intere&s;t and keep up his Corre&s;pondences, and particularly to encourage his Friends when Numbers are requi|&s;ite to carry on his Affairs; but this Part I &s;hall have Occa&s;ion to &s;peak of again, when I come to con&s;ider him as a Gentleman of Bu&s;ine&s;s in his Locality, and under the Head of vi&s;ible Appa|rition; but I return to the <HI>Foot.</HI></P>
<P>As I have thus &s;ugge&s;ted that the Devil him|&s;elf has politically &s;pread about this Notion con|cerning

his appearing with <HI>a Cloven-Foot,</HI> &s;o I doubt not that he has thought it for his Purpo&s;e to paint this <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> &s;o lively in the Imaginations of many of our People, and e&s;pecially of tho&s;e clear &s;ighted Folks who &s;ee the <HI>Devil</HI> when he is not to be &s;een, that they would make no Scruple to &s;ay, nay and to make Affidavit too, even before <HI>Satan</HI> him|&s;elf, whenever he &s;at upon the Bench, that they had &s;een his Wor&s;hip's FOOT at &s;uch and &s;uch a Time; this I advance the rather becau&s;e 'tis very much for his Intere&s;t to do this, for if we had not many Witne&s;&s;es, <HI>viva voce,</HI> to te&s;tify it, we &s;hould have had &s;ome ob&s;tinate Fellows always among us, who would have denied the Fact, or at lea&s;t have &s;poken doubtfully of it, and &s;o have rais'd Di&s;putes and Objections again&s;t it, as impo&s;&s;ible, or at lea&s;t as improbable; buzzing one ridiculous Notion or other into our Ears, as if the Devil was not &s;o black as he was painted, that he had no more a <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> than a Pope, who&s;e Apo|&s;tolical Toes have &s;o often been reverentially ki&s;s'd by Kings and Emperors: but now alas this Part is out of the Que&s;tion, not the Man in the Moon, not the Groaning-Board, not the &s;peaking of Fryar <HI>Bacon</HI>'s Brazen-Head, not the In&s;piration of <HI>Mother Shipton,</HI> or the Miracles of Dr. <HI>Fau|&s;tus,</HI> Things as certain as Death and Taxes, can be more firmly believ'd: The Devil not have a Cloven-Foot! I doubt not but I could, in a &s;hort Time, bring you a thou&s;and old Women together, that would as &s;oon believe there was no Devil at all; nay, they will tell you, he could not be a Devil without it, any more than he could come into the Room, and the Candles not burn blew, or go out and not leave a &s;mell of Brim&s;tone behind him.</P>
<P>Since then the Certainty of the Thing is &s;o well e&s;tabli&s;h'd, and there are &s;o many good and
<PB N="270" REF="280">
&s;ub&s;tantial Witne&s;&s;es ready to te&s;tify that he has a Cloven-Foot, and that they have &s;een it too; nay, and that we have Antiquity on our Side, for we have this Truth confirm'd by the Te&s;timony of many Ages; why &s;hould we doubt it any lon|ger? we can prove that many of our Ance&s;tors have been of this Opinion, and divers learn'd Au|thors have left it upon Record, as particularly that learned Familiari&s;t Mother <HI>Hazel,</HI> who&s;e Writings are to be found in MS. in the famous Li|brary at <HI>Pye-Corner;</HI> al&s;o the admir'd <HI>Joan</HI> of <HI>Ames|bury,</HI> the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> Witches, and the Reverend Exorci&s;t of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> who&s;e Hi&s;tory is extant among us to this Day; all the&s;e and many more may be quoted, and their Writings referr'd to for the Confirmation of the Antiquity of this Truth; but there &s;eems to be no Occa&s;ion for farther Evidence, 'tis e|nough, <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf, if he did not rai&s;e the Re|port, yet tacitly owns the Fact, at lea&s;t he ap|pears willing to have it believ'd, and be receiv'd as a general Truth for the Rea&s;ons above.</P>
<P>But be&s;ides all this, and as much a Je&s;t as &s;ome unbelieving People would have this Story pa&s;s for, who knows but that if <HI>Satan</HI> is empower'd to a&s;&s;ume any Shape or Body, and to appear to us vi&s;ibly, as if really &s;o &s;hap'd; I &s;ay, who knows but he may, by the &s;ame Authority, be allow'd to a&s;&s;ume the Addition of the Cloven-Foot, or two or four Cloven-Feet, if he plea&s;ed? and why not a <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> as well as any other Foot, if he thinks fit? For if the <HI>Devil</HI> can a&s;&s;ume a Shape, and can appear to Mankind in a vi&s;ible Form, it may, I doubt not, with as good Authority be ad|vanc'd that he is left at Liberty to a&s;&s;ume what Shape he plea&s;es, and to choo&s;e <HI>what Ca&s;e of Fle&s;h and Blood he'll plea&s;e to wear,</HI> whether real or imaginary; and if this Liberty be allow'd him,
<PB N="217" REF="281">
it is an admirable Di&s;gui&s;e for him to come gene|rally with his <HI>Cloven-Foot,</HI> that when he finds it for his Purpo&s;e, on &s;pecial Occa&s;ions to come without it, as I &s;aid above, he may not be &s;u&s;|pected; <HI>but take this with you as you go,</HI> that all this is upon a Suppo&s;ition that the <HI>Devil</HI> can a&s;|&s;ume a vi&s;ible Shape, and can make a real Appea|rance, which however I do not yet think fit to grant or deny.</P>
<P>Certain it is, the fir&s;t People who be&s;tow'd a <HI>Clo|ven-Foot</HI> upon the Devil, were not &s;o de&s;picable as you may imagine, but were real Favourites of Heaven; for did not <HI>Aaron</HI> &s;et up the <HI>Devil</HI> of a Calf in the Congregation, and &s;et the People a dancing about it for a God? Upon which Occa|&s;ion, Expo&s;itors tell us, that particular Command was given, <HI>Levit.</HI> xvii. 7. <HI>They &s;hall no more offer their Sacrifices unto</HI> Devils, <HI>after whom they have gone a Whoring;</HI> likewi&s;e King <HI>Jerobo|am</HI> &s;et up the two Calves, one at <HI>Dan</HI> and the other at <HI>Bethel,</HI> and we find them charg'd after|wards with &s;etting up the Wor&s;hip of <HI>Devils</HI> in&s;tead of the Wor&s;hip of <HI>God.</HI></P>
<P>After this we find &s;ome Nations actually &s;acri|ficed to the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Form of a Ram, and others of a Goat; from which, and that above of the Calves at <HI>Horeb,</HI> I doubt not the Story of the <HI>Cloven Foot</HI> fir&s;t derived; and it is plain that the Wor&s;hip of that Calf at <HI>Horeb</HI> is meant in the Scripture quoted above, <HI>Levit.</HI> xvii. 7. <HI>Thou &s;halt no more offer Sacrifices unto Devils:</HI> The O|riginal is <HI>Seghnirim;</HI> that is, rough and hairy <HI>Goats</HI> or <HI>Calves;</HI> and &s;ome think al&s;o in this Shape the <HI>Devil</HI> mo&s;t ordinarily appeared to the <HI>Egyp|tians</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> from whence it was derived.</P>
<P>Al&s;o in the old Writings of the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> I mean their hieroglyphick Writing, before the U&s;e of Letters was known, we are told this was

<P>But be this as it will, I do not &s;ee that <HI>Satan</HI> could have been at a Lo&s;s for &s;ome extraordinary Figure to have banter'd Mankind with, tho' this had not been thought of; but thinking of the <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> fir&s;t, and the Matter being indiffe|rent, this took place, and ea&s;ily rooted it &s;elf in the bewildred Fancy of the People, and now 'tis riveted too fa&s;t for the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf to remove it if he was di&s;po&s;ed to try; but as I &s;aid above, 'tis none of his Bu&s;ine&s;s to &s;olve Doubts or re|move Difficulties out of our Heads, but to per|plex us with more, as much as he can.</P>
<P>Some People carry this Matter a great deal higher &s;till, and will have the <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> be like the great Stone which the <HI>Bra&s;illian Conju|rers</HI> u&s;ed to &s;olve all difficult Que&s;tions upon, after having u&s;ed a great many mon&s;trous and bar|barous Ge&s;tures and Di&s;tortions of their Bodies, and cut certain Marks or magical Figures upon the Stone; &s;o, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> they will have this Cloven-Foot be a kind of a Conjuring-Stone, and tells us, that in former Times, when <HI>Satan</HI> drove a greater Trade with Mankind in public, than he has done of late; he gave this <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> as a Token to his particular Favourites to work Wonders with, and to conjure by, and that Witches, Fairies, Hobgoblins, and &s;uch Things, of which the Antients had &s;everal Kinds, at lea&s;t in their Ima|gination, had all a <HI>Goat's Leg</HI> with a <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> to put on upon extraordinary Occa&s;ions; it &s;eems this Method is of late grown out of Practice,

<P>But neither is this all, for other wou'd-be-wi&s;e People take upon them to make farther and more con&s;iderable Improvements upon this Doc|trine of the <HI>Cloven-Foot,</HI> and treat it as a mo&s;t &s;ignificant In&s;trument of Satan's private Opera|tion, and that as <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> is &s;aid to <HI>Divine,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to <HI>conjure</HI> by his Golden Cup which was put into <HI>Benjamin</HI>'s Sack, &s;o the <HI>Devil</HI> has mana|ged &s;everal of his &s;ecret Operations, and Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions, and other helli&s;h Mechani&s;ms upon the Spi|rits as well as Bodies of Men, by the Medium or In&s;trumentality of the <HI>Cloven-Foot;</HI> according|ly it had a Kind of an helli&s;h In&s;piration in it, and a &s;eparate and magical Power by which he wrought his infernal Miracles; that the Clo|ven-Foot had a &s;uperior Sgnification, and was not only emblematic and &s;ignificative of the Con|duct of Men, but really guided their Conduct in the mo&s;t important Affairs of Life; and that the Agents the Devil employ'd to influence Mankind, and to delude them and draw them into all the Snares and Traps that he lays continually for their De&s;truction, were equipp'd with this Foot in Aid of their other Powers for Mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>Here they read us learn'd Lectures upon the &s;overeign Operations which the <HI>Devil</HI> is at pre|&s;ent Ma&s;ter of, in the Government of humane Affairs; and how the Cloven-Foot is an Emblem of the true <HI>double Entendre</HI> or divided A&s;pect, which the great Men of the World generally act with, and by which all their Affairs are di|rected; from whence it comes to pa&s;s that there is
<PB N="274" REF="284">

<P>Thus the divided Hoof is the Repre&s;entative of a divided double Tongue, and Heart, an Emblem of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Hypocri&s;y, the mo&s;t fawn|ing and fatally deceiving Flattery; and here they give us very diverting Hi&s;tories, tho' tragical in them&s;elves, of the Manner which &s;ome of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s in&s;pired Agents have manag'd them&s;elves under the e&s;pecial Influence of the <HI>Cloven-Foot;</HI> how they have made War under the Pretence of Peace, murther'd Garri&s;ons under the mo&s;t &s;acred Capitulations, ma&s;&s;acred innocent Multitudes af|ter Surrenders to Mercy.</P>
<P>Again, they tell us the <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> has been made u&s;e of in all Trea&s;ons, Plots, A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations, and &s;ecret as well as open Murthers and Rebel|lions.

<P>It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, the Cloven-Foot was in its full Exerci&s;e in the next Reign, and the Ge|neration that ro&s;e up immediately after them, ar|rived to the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite Skill for Management of it; here they fa&s;ted and pray'd, there they plundred and murther'd; here they rais'd War for the King, and there they fought again&s;t him, cutting Throats &s;or <HI>God's Sake,</HI> and depo&s;|ing both King and kingly Government according to Law.</P>
<P>Nor was the <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> unemploy'd on all Sides, for 'tis the main Excellency of this In&s;tru|ment of Hell, that it acts on every Side, it is its denominating Quality, and is for that Rea&s;on call'd a Cloven or divided Hoof.</P>
<P>This mutilated Apparition has been &s;o public in other Countries too, that it &s;eems to convince us the Devil is not confin'd to <HI>England</HI> only, but that as his Empire extended to all the &s;ub|lunary World, &s;o he gives them all Room to &s;ee he is qualified to manage them his own Way.</P>
<P>What abundant U&s;e did that Prince of Di&s;&s;em|blers, <HI>Charles</HI> V. make of this Foot? 'twas by the Help of this Apparition of the Foot that he baited his Hook with the City of <HI>Milan,</HI> and tickled <HI>Francis</HI> I,

of <HI>France</HI> &s;o well with it, that when he pa&s;s'd thro' <HI>France,</HI> and was in that King's Power, he let him go, and never got the Bait off of the Hook neither; it &s;eems the <HI>Foot</HI> was not on King <HI>Francis</HI>'s Side at that Time.</P>
<P>How cruelly did <HI>Philip</HI> II. of <HI>Spain</HI> manage this Foot in the Murther of the Nobility of the <HI>Spani&s;h Netherlands,</HI> the A&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> and at la&s;t in that of his own Son <HI>Don Carlos</HI> Infant of <HI>Spain?</HI> and yet &s;uch was the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Craft, and &s;o nicely did he be&s;tir his <HI>Cloven-Hoof,</HI> that this Monarch died con&s;o|lated (tho' impenitent) in the Arms of the Church, and with the Benediction of the Clergy too, <HI>tho&s;e &s;econd be&s;t Managers of the &s;aid Hoof in the World.</HI></P>
<P>I mu&s;t acknowledge, I agree with this Opinion thus far; namely, that the Devil acting by this Clo|ven-Foot, as a Machine, has done great Things in the World for the propagating his dark Em|pire among us; and Hi&s;tory is full of Ex|amples, be&s;ides the little low priz'd Things done among us; for we are come to &s;uch a Kind of Degeneracy in Folly, that we have even di&s;ho|nour'd the <HI>Devil,</HI> and put this glorious Engine the Cloven-Foot to &s;uch mean U&s;es, that the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf &s;eems to be a&s;ham'd of us.</P>
<P>But to return a little to foreign Hi&s;tory, be&s;ides what has been mention'd above, we find flaming Examples of mo&s;t glorious Mi&s;chief done by this Weapon, when put into the Hands of Kings and Men of Fame in the World: How many Games have the Kings of <HI>France</HI> play'd with this <HI>Cloven-Foot,</HI> and that within a few Years of one another? Fir&s;t, <HI>Charles</HI> IX. play'd the <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> upon <HI>Ga&s;par Coligni</HI> Admiral of <HI>France,</HI> when he ca|re&s;s'd him, complimented him, invited him to <HI>Paris,</HI> to the Wedding of the King of <HI>Navar,</HI> call'd him Father, ki&s;s'd him, and when he was

wounded &s;ent his own Surgeons to take Care of him, and yet three Days after order'd him to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated and murther'd, u&s;ed with a thou|&s;and Indignities, and at la&s;t thrown out of the Win|dow into the Street to be in&s;ulted by the Rabble?</P>
<P>Did not <HI>Henry</HI> III. in the &s;ame Country, play the Cloven-Foot upon the Duke of <HI>Gui&s;e,</HI> when he call'd him to his Council, and caus'd him to be murther'd as he went in at the Door? The <HI>Gui&s;es</HI> again plaid the &s;ame Game back upon the King, when they &s;ent out a <HI>Jacobin</HI> Friar to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;i|nate him in his Tent as he lay at the Siege of <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, this Opera of the <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> has been acted all over the Chri&s;tian World, ever &s;ince <HI>Judas</HI> betray'd the Son of God with a Ki&s;s; nay, our Saviour &s;ays expre&s;sly of him, <HI>One of you is a Devil;</HI> and the &s;acred Text &s;ays in another Place, <HI>The Devil enter'd into Judas.</HI></P>
<P>It would take up a great deal of Time and Paper too, to give you a full Account of the Travels of this <HI>Cloven-Foot;</HI> its Progre&s;s into all the Courts of <HI>Europe,</HI> and with what mo&s;t accu|rate Hypocri&s;y <HI>Satan</HI> has made u&s;e of it upon many Occa&s;ions, and with what Succe&s;s; but as in the elaborate Work of which I ju&s;t now gave you a Specimen I de&s;ign one whole Volume upon this Subject, and which I &s;hall call, <HI>The com|pleat Hi&s;tory</HI> of the <HI>Cloven-Foot;</HI> I &s;ay, for that Rea&s;on, and divers others, I &s;hall &s;ay but very little more to it in this Place.</P>
<P>It remains to tell you, that this merry Story of the <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> is very e&s;&s;ential to the Hi&s;tory which I am now writing, as it has been all along the great Emblem of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Government in the World, and by which all his mo&s;t con&s;iderable Engagements have been an&s;wer'd and executed; for as he is &s;aid not to be able to conceal this Foot, but that he carries it always with him, it
<PB N="278" REF="288">
imports mo&s;t plainly, that the <HI>Devil</HI> would be no <HI>Devil</HI> if he was not a Di&s;&s;embler, a Deceiver, and carried a <HI>double Entendre</HI> in all he does or &s;ays; that he cannot but &s;ay one Thing and mean another, promi&s;e one Thing and do another, engage and not perform, declare and not intend, and act like a true <HI>Devil</HI> as he is, with a Countenance that is no Index of his Heart.</P>
<P>I might indeed go back to Originals, and de|rive this <HI>Cloven-Foot</HI> from Satan's primitive State as a Cherubim or a cele&s;tial Being, which Che|rubims, as <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> is &s;aid to have &s;een them about the Throne of God in Mount <HI>Sinai,</HI> and as the &s;ame <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> from the original repre&s;ented them afterwards covering the Ark, had the Head and Face of a Man, Wings of an Eagle, Body of a Lion, and Legs and Feet of a Calf; but this is not &s;o much to our pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, for as we are to allow that whatever <HI>Satan</HI> had of heavenly Beau|ty before the Fall, he lo&s;t it all when he com|menc'd <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;o to fetch his Original &s;o far up would be only to &s;ay, that he retain'd nothing but the <HI>Cloven-Foot,</HI> and that all the re&s;t of him was alter'd and deform'd, become frightful and horri|ble as the DEVIL; But his Cloven-Foot, as we now under&s;tand it, is rather my&s;tical and emble|matick, and de&s;cribes him only as the Fountain of Mi&s;chief and Trea&s;on, and the Prince of Hy|pocrites, and as &s;uch we are now to &s;peak of him.</P>
<P>'Tis from this Original all the hypocritic World copy, he wears the Foot on their Account, and from this Model they act: This made our ble&s;&s;ed Lord tell them, <HI>the Works of your Father ye will do,</HI> meaning the <HI>Devil,</HI> as he had expre&s;s'd it ju&s;t before.</P>
<P>Nor does he deny the U&s;e of the <HI>Foot</HI> to the meaner Cla&s;s of his Di&s;ciples in the World, but
<PB N="279" REF="289">
decently equips them all upon every Occa&s;ion with a needful Proportion of Hypocri&s;y and De|ceit; that they may hand on the Power of pro|mi&s;cuous Fraud thro' all his temporal Dominions, and wear <HI>the Foot</HI> always about them as a Badge of their profe&s;s'd Share in whatever is done by that Means.</P>
<P>Thus every Di&s;&s;embler, every fal&s;e Friend, every &s;ecret Cheat, every Bearskin-Jobber has a <HI>Clo|ven-Foot,</HI> and &s;o far hands on the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Inte|re&s;t by the &s;ame powerful Agency of Art, as the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf u&s;es to act when he appears in Per|&s;on, or would act if he was ju&s;t now upon the Spot; for this <HI>Foot</HI> is a Machine which is to be wound up and wound down, as the Cau&s;e it ap|pears for requires; and there are Agents and En|gineers to act in it by Directions of <HI>Satan</HI> (the grand Engineer) who lies &s;till in his Retirement, only i&s;&s;uing out his Orders as he &s;ees convenient.</P>
<P>Again, every Cla&s;s, every Trade, every Shop|keeper, every Pedlar, nay, that meane&s;t of Trade&s;|men, that Church Pedlar the Pope, has a Cloven-Foot, with which he <HI>Paw wa's</HI> upon the World, wi&s;hes them all well, and at the &s;ame time cheats them; wi&s;hes them all fed, and at the &s;ame time &s;tarves them; wi&s;hes them all in Heaven, and at the &s;ame time marches before them directly to the <HI>Devil, alamode de Cloven-Foot.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, the very Bench, the everliving Foun|dation of Ju&s;tice in the World; how often has it been made the Tool of Violence, the Refuge of Oppre&s;&s;ion, the Seat of Bribery and Corruption, by this Mon&s;ter in Ma&s;querade, and that every where (our own Country always excepted)? They had much better wipe out the Picture of Ju&s;tice blinded, and having the Sword and Scales in her Hand, which in foreign Countries is generally painted over the Seat of tho&s;e who &s;it to do Ju&s;tice, and place in&s;tead thereof a naked unarm'd Cloven-Hoof, a
<PB N="280" REF="290">
proper Emblem of that Spirit that Influences the World, and of the Ju&s;tice we often &s;ee admini|&s;tred among them; humane Imagination cannot form an Idea more &s;uitable, nor the <HI>Devil</HI> pro|po&s;e an Engine more or better qualified for an O|peration of Ju&s;tice, by the Influence of Bribery and corruption; it is this magnipotent In&s;trument in the Hands of the <HI>Devil</HI> which under the clo&s;e&s;t Di&s;gui&s;e agitates every Pa&s;&s;ion, bribes every Affection, blackens every Virtue, gives a double Face to Words and Actions, and to all Per&s;ons who have any Concern in them, and in a Word, makes us all <HI>Devils</HI> to one another.</P>
<P>Indeed the <HI>Devil</HI> has taken but a dark Emblem to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd by, for this of a Goat was &s;aid to be a Creature hated by Mankind from the Beginning, and that there is a natural Antipathy in Mankind again&s;t them: Hence the Scape Goat was to bear the Sins of the People, and to go into the Wilderne&s;s with all that Burthen upon him.</P>
<P>But we have a Saying among us, in Defence of which we mu&s;t enquire into the proper Sphere of Action which may be a&s;&s;igned to this <HI>Cloven-Foot,</HI> as hitherto de&s;cribed: The Proverb is this; <HI>Every</HI> Devil <HI>has not a Cloven-Foot.</HI> This Pro|verb, in&s;tead of giving us &s;ome more favourable Thoughts of the <HI>Devil,</HI> confirms what I have &s;aid already, that the <HI>Devil</HI> rais'd this Scandal up|on him&s;elf; I mean, the Report that he cannot conceal or di&s;gui&s;e his Devil's Foot, or Hoof, but that it mu&s;t appear, under whatever Habit he &s;hews him&s;elf; and the Rea&s;on I gave holds good &s;till, <HI>namely,</HI> that he may be more effectu|ally conceal'd when he goes abroad without it: For if the People were fully per&s;uaded that the <HI>Devil</HI> could not appear without this Badge of his Honour, or Mark of his Infamy, <HI>take it as</HI>
<PB N="281" REF="291">
<HI>you will;</HI> and that he was bound al&s;o to &s;hew it upon all Occa&s;ions, it would be natural to con|clude, that whatever frightful Appearances might be &s;een in the World, if the Cloven Foot did not al&s;o appear, we had no Occa&s;ion to look for the <HI>Devil,</HI> or &s;o much as to think of him, much le&s;s to apprehend he was near us; and as this might be a Mi&s;take, and that the <HI>Devil</HI> might be there while we thought our &s;elves &s;o &s;ecure, it might on many Occa&s;ions be a Mi&s;take of very ill Con|&s;equence, and in particular, as it would give the <HI>Devil</HI> room to act in the Dark, and not be di&s;|cover'd, where it might be mo&s;t needful to know him.</P>
<P>From this &s;hort Hint, thus repeated, I draw a new The&s;is, namely, That <HI>Devil</HI> is mo&s;t dan|gerous that has no Cloven-Foot; or, if you will have it in Words more to the common Under|&s;tanding, the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;eems to be mo&s;t dangerous when he goes without his Cloven-Foot.</P>
<P>And here a learned Speculation offers it &s;elf to our Debate, and which indeed I ought to call a Council of Ca&s;ui&s;ts, and Men learned in the <HI>De|vil</HI>'s Politicks, to determine:</P>
<P>Whether is mo&s;t hurtful to the World, the <HI>Devil</HI> walking about without his Cloven-Foot, or the Cloven-Foot walking about without the <HI>De|vil?</HI></P>
<P>It is indeed a nice and difficult Que&s;tion, and merits to be well enquir'd into; for which Rea|&s;on, and divers others, I have referr'd it to be treated with &s;ome Decency, and as a Di&s;pute of Dignity &s;ufficient to take up a Chapter by it &s;elf.</P>

<P>IN di&s;cu&s;&s;ing this mo&s;t critical Di&s;tinction of Satan's private Motions, I mu&s;t, as the Pul|pit Gentlemen direct us, explain the Text, and let you know what I mean by &s;everal dark Expre&s;&s;i|ons in it, that I may not be under&s;tood to talk (as the <HI>Devil</HI> walks) in the dark.</P>

<P>NOW as I &s;tudy Brevity, and yet would be under&s;tood too, you may plea&s;e to under&s;tand me as I under&s;tand my &s;elf, thus.</P>
<P N="1">1. That I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> really has a full Intercour&s;e in, and through, and about this Globe, with Egre&s;s and Regre&s;s, for the carrying on his &s;pe|cial Affairs, when, how, and where, to his Maje&s;ty, in his great Wi&s;dom, it &s;hall &s;eem meet; that &s;ometimes he appears and be|comes vi&s;ible, and that, like a Ma&s;tiff with|out his Clog, he does not always carry his Cloven-Foot with him. This will nece&s;&s;a|rily bring me to &s;ome Debate upon the mo&s;t important Que&s;tion of Apparitions, Haunt|ings, Walkings, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> whether of <HI>Satan</HI> in
<PB N="283" REF="293">
human Shape, or of human Creatures in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Shape, or in any other manner what|&s;oever.</P>
<P N="2">2. I mu&s;t al&s;o be allow'd to tell you that Satan has a great deal of Wrong done him by the general embracing vulgar Errors, and that there is a Cloven-Foot oftentimes with|out a <HI>Devil;</HI> or, in &s;hort, that Satan is not guilty of all the &s;imple Things, no, or of all the wicked Things we charge him with.</P>
<P>The&s;e two Heads well &s;ettled will fully explain the Title of this Chapter, an&s;wer the Query men|tioned in it, and at the &s;ame time corre&s;pond ve|ry well with, and give us a farther Pro&s;pect into the main and original De&s;ign of this Work, <HI>namely, The Hi&s;tory of the Devil.</HI> We are &s;o fond of, and plea&s;ed with the general Notion of &s;eeing the <HI>Devil,</HI> that I am loth to di&s;oblige my Readers &s;o much as calling in que&s;tion his Vi&s;i|bility would do. Nor is it my Bu&s;ine&s;s, any more than it is his, to undeceive them, where the Belief is &s;o agreeable to them; e&s;pecially &s;ince upon the whole 'tis not one Farthing matter, ei|ther on one Side or on the other, whether it be &s;o or no, or whether the Truth of Fact be ever di&s;covered or not.</P>
<P>Certain it is, whether we &s;ee him or no, here he is, and I make no doubt but he is looking on while I am writing this Part of his Story, whe|ther behind me, or at my Elbow, or over my Shoulder, is not material to me, nor have I once turned my Head about to &s;ee whether he is there or no; for if he be not in the In&s;ide, I have &s;o mean an Opinion of all his extrava&s;ated Powers, that it &s;eems of very little Con&s;equence to me what Shape he takes up, or in what Po&s;ture he appears; nor indeed can I find in all my Enquiry
<PB N="284" REF="294">
that ever the <HI>Devil</HI> appear'd <HI>(Qua Devil)</HI> in an of the mo&s;t dangerous or important of his De+&s;igns in the World; the mo&s;t of his Projects e&s;pecially of the &s;ignificant Part of them, having been carried on another way.</P>
<P>However, as I am &s;atisfied no Body will be pleas'd if I &s;hould di&s;pute the Reality of his Ap|pearance, and the World runs away with it as $ receiv'd Point, and that admits no Di&s;pute, I &s;hall mo&s;t readily grant the General, and give you &s;ome Account of the Particulars.</P>
<P>Hi&s;tory is fruitful of Particulars, whether In|vention has &s;upply'd them or not, I will not &s;ay, where the <HI>Devil</HI> is brought upon the Stage in plain and undeniable Apparition: The Story of <HI>Samuel</HI> being rais'd by the Witch of <HI>Endor,</HI> I &s;hall leave quite out of my Li&s;t, becau&s;e there are &s;o many Scruples and Objections again&s;t that Story; and as I &s;hall not di&s;pute with the Scripture, &s;o on the other hand, I have &s;o much Deference for the Dignity of the <HI>Devil,</HI> as not to determine ra&s;hly how far it may be in the Power of every old <HI>(Witch)</HI> Woman, to call him up whenever &s;he plea&s;es, and that he mu&s;t come, whatever the Pretence is, or whatever Bu&s;ine&s;s of Con&s;equence he may be engaged in, as often as 'tis needful for her to <HI>Pa wa</HI> for half a Crown, or perhaps le&s;s than half the Money.</P>
<P>Nor will I undertake to tell you, till I have talk'd farther with him about it, how far the <HI>Devil</HI> is concern'd to di&s;cover Frauds, detect Murthers, reveal Secrets, and e&s;pecially to tell where any Money is hid, and &s;hew Folks where to find it; 'tis an odd thing that Satan &s;hould think it of Con&s;equence to come and tell us where &s;uch a Mi&s;er hid a Strong Box, or where &s;uch an old Woman buried her <HI>Chamber Pot</HI> full of Money, the Value of all which is perhaps but a

Trifle, when at the &s;ame time he lets &s;o many Veins of Gold, &s;o many unexhau&s;ted Mines, nay, Mountains of Silver, as, we may depend upon it, are hid in the Bowels of the Earth, and which it would be &s;o much to the Good of whole Na|tions to di&s;cover, lie &s;till there, and never &s;ay one Word of them to any Body. Be&s;ides, how does the <HI>Devil</HI>'s doing Things &s;o foreign to him|&s;elf, and &s;o out of his way, agree with the re&s;t of his Character; namely, &s;hewing a kind of a friendly Di&s;po&s;ition to Mankind, or doing bene|ficent Things? This is &s;o beneath <HI>Satan</HI>'s Quali|ty, and looks &s;o little, that I &s;carce know what to &s;ay to it; but that which is &s;till more pun|gent in the Ca&s;e is, the&s;e Things are &s;o out of his Road, and &s;o foreign to his Calling, that it &s;hocks our Faith in them, and &s;eems to cla&s;h with all the ju&s;t Notions we have of him, and of his Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World. The like is to be &s;aid of tho&s;e little merry Turns we bring him in acting with us, and upon us, upon trifling and &s;imple Occa&s;ions, &s;uch as tumbling Chairs and Stools about Hou&s;e, &s;etting Pots and Ve&s;&s;els Bot|tom upward, to&s;&s;ing the Gla&s;s and Crockery Ware about without breaking; and &s;uch like mean fooli&s;h Things, beneath the Dignity of the <HI>De|vil</HI> who, in my Opinion, is rather employ'd in &s;etting the World with the Bottom upward, tumbling Kings and Crowns about, and da&s;hing the Nations one again&s;t another; rai&s;ing Tem|pe&s;ts and Storms, whether at Sea, or on Shore; and, in a word, doing capital Mi&s;chiefs &s;uitable to his Nature, and agreeable to his Name, <HI>Devil;</HI> and &s;uited to that Circum&s;tance of his Condition, which I have fully repre&s;ented in the primitive Part of his exil'd State.</P>
<P>But to bring in the <HI>Devil</HI> playing at Pu&s;h-pin with the World, or like <HI>Domitian</HI> catching Flies,
<PB N="286" REF="296">
that is to &s;ay, doing nothing to the purpo&s;e; this is not only deluding our &s;elves, but putting a Slur upon the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf; and, I &s;ay, I &s;hall not di&s;honour Satan &s;o much as to &s;uppo&s;e any thing in it: However, as I mu&s;t have a care too how I take away the proper Materials of Winter Evening Frippery, and leave the good Wives nothing of the Devil to fright the Children with, I &s;hall carry the weighty Point no farther. No doubt the <HI>Devil</HI> and Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> were very inti|mate; I &s;hould rob you of a very &s;ignificant <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>As great as the Devil and Doctor</HI> Fau&s;tus. Vulg. Dr. <HI>Fo&s;ter.</HI></NOTE> Proverb, if I &s;hould &s;o much as doubt it; no doubt the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hew'd him&s;elf in the Gla&s;s to that fair Lady who look'd in it to &s;ee where to place her Patches; but then it &s;hould follow too that the <HI>Devil</HI> is an Enemy to the Ladies wear|ing Patches, and that has &s;ome Difficulties in it which we cannot &s;o ea&s;ily reconcile; but we mu&s;t tell the Story, and leave out the Con&s;equences.</P>
<P>But to come to more remarkable Things, and in which the <HI>Devil</HI> has thought fit to act in a Figure more &s;uitable to his Dignity, and on Oc|ca&s;ions con&s;i&s;tent with him&s;elf; take the Story of the Appearance of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar,</HI> or the <HI>Devil</HI> a&s;&s;uming that murthered <HI>Emperor,</HI> to the great <HI>Marcus Brutus,</HI> who, notwith&s;tanding all the good Things &s;aid to ju&s;tify it, was no le&s;s than a King-killer and an A&s;&s;a&s;&s;inator, which we in our Language call by a very good Name, and pecu|liar to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tongue, a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ian.</HI></P>
<P>The Spectre had certainly the Appearance of <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> with his Wounds bleeding fre&s;h, as if he had ju&s;t receiv'd the fatal Blow; he had re|proach'd him with his Ingratitude, with a <HI>Tu Brute! tu quoque, mi fili:</HI> <Q>&startq;What Thou <HI>Brutus!</HI>
<PB N="287" REF="297">
Thou, my adopted Son!&endq;</Q> Now Hi&s;tory &s;eems to agree univer&s;ally, not only in the Story it&s;elf, but in the Circum&s;tances of it; we have only to ob&s;erve that the <HI>Devil</HI> had certainly Power to a&s;&s;ume, not a human Shape only, but the Shape of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> in particular.</P>
<P>Had <HI>Brutus</HI> been a timorous <HI>Con&s;cience-harry'd,</HI> weak-headed Wretch, had he been under the Horror of the Guilt, and terrify'd with the Dan|gers that were before him at that time, we might &s;ugge&s;t that he was over-run with the Vapours, that the Terrors which were upon his Mind di&s;|order'd him, that his Head was delirious and pre|po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and that his Fancy only plac'd <HI>Cae&s;ar</HI> &s;o continually in his Eye, that it realiz'd him to his Imagination, and he believ'd he &s;aw him; with many other &s;ugge&s;ted Difficulties to inva|lidate the Story, and render the Reality of it doubtful.</P>
<P>But the contrary, to an Extreme, was the Ca&s;e of <HI>Brutus;</HI> his known Character plac'd him a|bove the Power of all Hypocondriacks, or fan|ciful Delu&s;ions; <HI>Brutus</HI> was of a true <HI>Roman</HI> Spirit, a bold Hero, of an intrepid Courage; one that &s;corn'd to fear even the <HI>Devil,</HI> as the Story allows: Be&s;ides, he glory'd in the Action; there cou'd be no Terror of Mind upon him; he valued him&s;elf upon it, as done in the Service of Liberty, and the Cau&s;e of his Country; and was &s;o far from being frighted at the <HI>Devil</HI> in the wor&s;t Shape, that he &s;poke fir&s;t to him, and ask'd him, <HI>What art thou?</HI> and when he was cited to &s;ee him again at <HI>Philippi,</HI> an&s;wer'd, with a Gal|lantry that knew no Fear, <HI>well, I will &s;ee thee there.</HI> Whatever the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s was with <HI>Brutus,</HI> this is certain, according to all the Hi&s;torians who give us the Account of it, that <HI>Brutus</HI> di&s;|cover'd no Fear; he did not, <HI>like Saul at Endor,</HI>
<PB N="288" REF="298">
fall to the Ground in a Swoon, 1 <HI>Sam.</HI> xxviii. 20. <HI>Then Saul fell all along upon the Earth, and there was no Strength in him, and was &s;ore afraid.</HI> In a word, I &s;ee no room to charge <HI>Brutus</HI> with be|ing over-run with the <HI>Hyppo,</HI> or with Vapours, or with Fright and Terror of Mind; but he &s;aw the <HI>Devil,</HI> that's certain, and with Eyes open, his Courage not at all daunted, his Mind re&s;olute, and with the utmo&s;t Compo&s;ure &s;poke to him, reply'd to his An&s;wer, and defy'd his Summons to Death, which indeed he fear'd not, as appear'd afterward.</P>
<P>I come next to an In&s;tance as eminent in Hi&s;|tory as the other; this was in <HI>Char.</HI> VI. of <HI>France,</HI> &s;irnamed, <HI>The Beloved;</HI> who riding over the Fo|re&s;t near <HI>Mans,</HI> a gha&s;tly frightful Fellow (that is to &s;ay, the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;o clothed in human Vizor) came up to his Hor&s;e, and taking hold of his Bridle, &s;top'd him, with the Addition of the&s;e Words, <HI>Stop King, whither go you? You are be|tray'd!</HI> and immediately di&s;appear'd. It is true, the King had been di&s;temper'd in his Head be|fore, and &s;o he might have been deceiv'd, and we might have charg'd it to the Account of a whim&s;ical Brain, or the Power of his Imagina|tion; but this was in the Face of his Attendants, &s;everal of his great Officers, Courtiers, and Prin|ces of the Blood being with him, who all &s;aw the Man, heard the Words, and immediately, to their A&s;toni&s;hment, lo&s;t Sight of the Spectre, who vani&s;h'd from them all.</P>
<P>Two Witne&s;&s;es will convict a Murtherer, why not a Traitor? This mu&s;t be the <HI>Old Gentleman,</HI> emblematically &s;o called, or who mu&s;t it be? nay, who el&s;e could it be? His Ugline&s;s is not the Ca&s;e, tho' <HI>ugly as the Devil,</HI> is a Proverb in his Favour; but vani&s;hing out of &s;ight is an E&s;&s;en|tial to a Spirit, and to an evil Spirit in our Times e&s;pecially.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="299">
The&s;e are &s;ome of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Extraordinaries, and it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd they are not the mo&s;t agreeable to Mankind, for &s;ometimes he takes upon him to di&s;order his Friends very much on the&s;e Occa&s;ions, as in the above Ca&s;e of <HI>Cha.</HI> VI of <HI>France;</HI> the King, they &s;ay, was really de|mented ever after; that is, as we vulgarly, but not always improperly, expre&s;s it, he was really <HI>frighted out of his Wits.</HI> Whether the malicious <HI>Devil</HI> intended it &s;o, or not, is not certain, tho' it was not &s;o foreign to his particular Di&s;po&s;ition if he did.</P>
<P>But where he is more intimate, we are told he appears in a manner le&s;s di&s;agreeable, and there he is more properly <HI>a familiar Spirit;</HI> that is, in &s;hort, a <HI>Devil</HI> of their Acquaintance: It is true, the Antients under&s;tand the Word, <HI>a familiar Spirit,</HI> to be one of the kinds of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but if it &s;erves our turn as well under the Denomina|tion of an intimate <HI>Devil,</HI> or a <HI>Devil</HI> vi&s;itant, it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd to be as near in the li|teral Sen&s;e and Acceptation of the Word, as the other; nay, it mu&s;t be allow'd 'tis a very great Piece of Familiarity in the <HI>Devil</HI> to make Vi&s;its, and &s;hew none of his Di&s;agreeables, not appear formidable, or in the Shape of what he is, re|&s;pectfully withholding his di&s;mal Part, in Com|pa&s;&s;ion to the Infirmities of his Friends.</P>
<P>It is true, <HI>Satan</HI> may be oblig'd to make dif|ferent Appearances, as the &s;everal Circum&s;tances of Things call for it; in &s;ome Ca&s;es he makes his publick Entry, and then he mu&s;t &s;hew him|&s;elf in his Habit of Ceremony; in other Ca&s;es he comes upon private Bu&s;ine&s;s, and then he ap|pears in Di&s;gui&s;e; in &s;ome publick Ca&s;es he may think fit to be <HI>incog.</HI> and then he appears dre&s;s'd <HI>a la Ma&s;que;</HI> &s;o they &s;ay he appear'd at the fa|mous St. <HI>Bartholomew</HI> Wedding at <HI>Paris,</HI> where
<PB N="290" REF="300">
he came in dre&s;s'd up like a Trumpeter, danc'd in his Habit, &s;ounded a <HI>Levet,</HI> and then went out and rung the Alarm-Bell (which was the Signal to begin the Ma&s;&s;acre) half an Hour before the Time appointed, le&s;t the King's Mind &s;hould al|ter, and his Heart fail him.</P>
<P>If the Story be not made upon him, (for we &s;hould not &s;lander the <HI>Devil)</HI> it &s;hould &s;eem, he was not thoroughly &s;atisfied in King <HI>Charles</HI> IX.'s Steadine&s;s in his Cau&s;e; for the King, it &s;eems, had relax'd a little once before, and Satan might be afraid he would fall off again, and &s;o prevent the Execution: Others &s;ay, the King did relent im|mediately after the ringing the <HI>Alarm-Bell,</HI> but that then it was too late, the Work was begun, and the Rage of Blood having been let loo&s;e a|mong the People, there was no recalling the Or|der. If the <HI>Devil</HI> was thus brought to the Ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a &s;ecret Management, it mu&s;t be own|ed he did it dexterou&s;ly; but I have not Autho|rity enough for the Story, to charge him with the Particulars, &s;o I leave it <HI>au croc.</HI></P>
<P>I have much better Vouchers for the Story following, which I had &s;o &s;olemnly confirm'd by one that liv'd in the Family, that I never doubt|ed the Truth of it. There liv'd, in the Pari&s;h of St. <HI>Bennet Fynk,</HI> near the <HI>Royal Exchange,</HI> an hone&s;t poor Widow Woman, who, <HI>her Husband being lately dead,</HI> took Lodgers into her Hou&s;e; that is, &s;he let out &s;ome of her Rooms in order to le&s;&s;en her own Charge of Rent; among the re&s;t, &s;he let her Garrets to a working Watch|wheel-maker, or one &s;ome way concern'd in making the Movements of Watches, and who work'd to tho&s;e Shop-keepers who &s;ell Watches; as is u&s;ual.</P>
<P>It happened that a Man and Woman went up, to &s;peak with this Movement-maker upon &s;ome

Bu&s;ine&s;s which related to his Trade, and when they were near the Top of the Stairs, the Garret-Door where he u&s;ually worked being wide open, they &s;aw the poor Man (the Watch-maker, or Wheel-maker) had hang'd him&s;elf upon a Beam which was left open in the Room a little lower than the Plai&s;ter, or Ceiling: Surpriz'd at the Sight, the Woman &s;top'd, and cried out to the Man who was behind her on the Stairs that he &s;hould run up, and cut the poor Creature down.</P>
<P>At that very Moment comes a Man ha&s;tily from another Part of the Room which they upon the Stairs could not &s;ee, bringing a Joint-Stool in his Hand, as if in great Ha&s;te, and &s;ets it down ju&s;t by the Wretch that was hang'd, and getting up as ha&s;tily upon it pulls a Knife out of his Pocket, and taking hold of the Rope with one of his Hands, beckon'd to the Woman and the Man behind her with his Head, as if to &s;top and not come up, &s;hewing them the Knife in his other Hand, as if he was ju&s;t going to cut the poor Man down.</P>
<P>Upon this, the Woman &s;topp'd a while, but the Man who &s;tood on the Joint-Stool continued with his Hand and Knife as if fumbling at the Knot, but did not yet cut the Man down; at which the Woman cried out again, and the Man behind her call'd to her, Go up, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> and help the Man upon the Stool! &s;uppo&s;ing &s;omething hindred. But the Man upon the Stool made Signs to them again to be quiet, and not come on, as if &s;aying, I &s;hall do it immediately; then he made two Strokes with his Knife, as if cutting the Rope, and then &s;topp'd again; and &s;till the poor Man was hanging, and con&s;equently dying: Upon this, the Woman on the Stairs cried out to him, What ails you? Why don't you cut the poor Man down? And the Man behind her,
<PB N="292" REF="304">
having no more Patience, thru&s;ts her by, and &s;aid to her, Let me come, I'll warrant you I'll do it; and with that runs up and forward into the Room to the Man; but when he came there, behold, the poor Man was there hanging; but no Man with a Knife, or Joint-Stool, or any &s;uch thing to be &s;een, all that was Spectre and Delu&s;ion, in order, no doubt, to let the poor Creature that had hang'd him&s;elf peri&s;h and expire.</P>
<P>The Man was &s;o frighted and &s;urpriz'd, that with all the Courage he had before, he drop'd on the Floor as one dead, and the Woman at la&s;t was fain to cut the poor Man down with a Pair of Sci&s;&s;ars, and had much to do to effect it.</P>
<P>As I have no room to doubt the Truth of this Story, which I had from Per&s;ons on who&s;e Ho|ne&s;ty I could depend, &s;o I think it needs very little Trouble to convince us who the Man upon the Stool mu&s;t be, and that it was the <HI>Devil</HI> who plac'd him&s;elf there in order to fini&s;h the Mur|ther of the Man who he had, <HI>Devil-like,</HI> tempt|ed before, and prevail'd with to be his own Ex|ecutioner. Be&s;ides, it corre&s;ponds &s;o well with the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Nature, and with his Bu&s;ine&s;s, <HI>viz.</HI> that of a <HI>Murtherer,</HI> that I never que&s;tion'd it; nor can I think we wrong the <HI>Devil</HI> at all to charge him with it.</P>
<P><HI>N. B.</HI> I cannot be po&s;itive in the remaining Part of this Story, <HI>viz.</HI> whether the Man was cut down &s;oon enough to be recover'd, or whether the <HI>Devil</HI> carry'd his Point, and kept off the Man and Woman till it was too late; but be it which it will, 'tis plain he did his Devili&s;h Endeavour, and &s;tay'd till he was forc'd to ab&s;cond again.</P>
<P>We have many &s;olid Tales well atte&s;ted, as well in Hi&s;tory as in the Reports of hone&s;t Peo|ple,
<PB N="293" REF="305">
who could not be deceived, intimating the <HI>Devil's</HI> per&s;onal Appearance, &s;ome in one Place, &s;ome in another; as al&s;o &s;ometimes in one Habit or Dre&s;s, and &s;ometimes in another; and it is to be ob&s;erved, that in none of tho&s;e which are mo&s;t like to be real, and in which there is lea&s;t of Fancy and Vapour, you have any Mention of the <HI>Cloven Foot,</HI> which rather &s;eems to be a mere Invention of Men (and perhaps chiefly of tho&s;e who had a cloven Under&s;tanding) I mean a &s;hal|low kind of Craft, the Effect of an empty and &s;imple Head, thinking by &s;uch a well-meant, tho' weak Fraud, to repre&s;ent the <HI>Devil</HI> to the old Women and Children of the Age, with &s;ome Addition &s;uitable to the Weakne&s;s of their Intel|lects, and &s;uited to making them afraid of him.</P>
<P>I have another Account of a Per&s;on who tra|vell'd upwards of four Years with the <HI>Devil</HI> in his Company, and convers'd mo&s;t intimately with him all the while; nay, if I may believe the Story, he knew mo&s;t part of the Time that he was the <HI>Devil,</HI> and yet convers'd with him, and that very profitably, for he perform'd many very u&s;eful Services for him, and con&s;tantly pre&s;erv'd him from the Danger of Wolves and wild Bea&s;ts, which the Country he travell'd thro' was intole|rably full of. Where, by the way, you are to un|der&s;tand, that the Wolves and Bears in tho&s;e Countries knew the <HI>Devil,</HI> whatever Di&s;gui&s;e he went in; or that the <HI>Devil</HI> has &s;ome Way to fright Bears and &s;uch Creatures, more than we know of. Nor could this <HI>Devil</HI> ever be prevail'd upon to hurt him or any of his Company. This Account has an innumerable Number of divert|ing Incidents attending it; but they are equal to all the re&s;t in Bulk, and therefore too long for this Book.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="306">
I find too upon &s;ome more ordinary Occa&s;i|ons the <HI>Devil</HI> has appear'd to &s;everal People at their Call: This indeed &s;hews abundance of good Humour in him, con&s;idering him as a <HI>Devil,</HI> and that he was mighty complai&s;ant: Nay &s;ome, they tell us, have a Power to rai&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> when|ever they think fit; this I cannot bring the <HI>De|vil</HI> to a Level with, unle&s;s I &s;hould allow him to be <HI>&s;ervus Servorum,</HI> as another <HI>Devil</HI> in Di&s;gui&s;e calls him&s;elf; &s;ubjected to every old Wizard's Call; or that he is under a Nece&s;&s;ity of appear|ing on &s;uch or &s;uch particular Occa&s;ions, who|ever it is that calls him; which would bring the <HI>Devil's</HI> Circum&s;tances to a Pitch of Slavery which I &s;ee no Rea&s;on to believe of them.</P>
<P>Here al&s;o I mu&s;t take Notice again, that tho' I &s;ay the <HI>Devil,</HI> when I &s;peak of all the&s;e Appa|ritions, whether of a greater or le&s;&s;er Kind, yet I am not oblig'd to &s;uppo&s;e Satan him&s;elf in Per|&s;on is concern'd to &s;hew him&s;elf, but that &s;ome of his <HI>Agents,</HI> Deputies and Servants, are &s;ent to that Purpo&s;e, and directed what Di&s;gui&s;e of Fle&s;h and Blood to put on, as may be &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>This &s;eems to be the only Way to reconcile all tho&s;e &s;imple and ridiculous Appearances which not <HI>Satan,</HI> but his Emi&s;&s;aries, (which we old Women call Imps) &s;ometimes make, and the mean and &s;orry Employment they are put to: Thus Fame tells us of a certain Witch of Qua|lity, who call'd the <HI>Devil</HI> once to carry her over a Brook where the Water was &s;well'd with a ha&s;ty Rain, and la&s;h'd him &s;oundly with her Whip for letting her Ladi&s;hip fall into the Wa|ter before &s;he was quite over. Thus al&s;o, as Fame tells us, &s;he &s;et the <HI>Devil</HI> to work, and made him build <HI>Crowland</HI> Abbey, where there was no Foundation to be found, only for di&s;|turbing
<PB N="295" REF="307">
the Workmen a little who were fir&s;t &s;et about it.

<P>Another Piece of Puni&s;hment no doubt it was, when the <HI>Devil</HI> was oblig'd to bring the Stones out of <HI>Wales</HI> into <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> to build <HI>Stone-heng:</HI> How this was ordered in tho&s;e Days, when it &s;eems they kept <HI>Satan</HI> to hard Labour, I know not; I believe it mu&s;t be regi&s;tred among the an|tient Pieces of Art which are lo&s;t in the World, &s;uch as melting of Stone, painting of Gla&s;s, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Certainly they had the <HI>Devil</HI> under Correction in tho&s;e Days; that is to &s;ay, tho&s;e le&s;&s;er Sorts of <HI>Devils;</HI> but I cannot think that the <HI>muckle Thief Devil,</HI> as they call him in the <HI>North,</HI> the Grand Seignior <HI>Devil</HI> of all, was ever reduced to Di&s;cipline. What <HI>Devil</HI> it was that <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI> took by the No&s;e with his red hot Tongs, I have not yet examin'd Antiquity enough to be certain of, any more than I can what Devil it was that St. <HI>Francis</HI> play'd &s;o many warm Tricks with, and made him run away from him &s;o often: How|ever, this I take upon me to &s;ay, in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Behalf, that it cou'd not be our <HI>Satan,</HI> the Arch <HI>Devil</HI> of all <HI>Devils,</HI> of whom I have been talk|ing &s;o long.</P>
<P>Nor is it unworthy the Occa&s;ion, to take no|tice that we really wrong the <HI>Devil,</HI> and &s;peak of him very much to his Di&s;advantage, when we &s;ay of &s;uch a Great Lord, or of &s;uch a Lady of Quality, <HI>I think the</HI> Devil <HI>is in Your Grace:</HI> No, no, Satan has other Bu&s;ine&s;s, he very rarely po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;es F&mdash;ls: Be&s;ides, &s;ome are &s;o far from hav|ing

and is far from being unju&s;t; <HI>her Grace</HI> (as &s;he, it may be, is now &s;tiled) has not acted, at lea&s;t that I ever heard of, &s;o unworthy her great and illu&s;trious Original, that we &s;hould think &s;he has lo&s;t any thing by walking about the World &s;o many Years in Apparition: But to give her the due Homage of her Quality, &s;he has acted as con&s;onant to the E&s;&s;ence and Nature of <HI>Devil,</HI> which &s;he has &s;uch a Claim to, as was con&s;i&s;tent with the needful Re&s;erve of her pre&s;ent Di&s;gui&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor &s;hall we lead the Reader into any Mi&s;take concerning this Part of our Work, as if this was or is meant to be a particular Satyr upon the D&mdash;&s;s of&mdash;, and upon her only, as if we had no DEVILS among us in the Pheno|mena of fair Ladies, but this one: If Satan would be &s;o hone&s;t to us as he might be (and 'twou'd be very ingenuous in him, that mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, to give us a little of his Illumi|nation in this Ca&s;e) we &s;hould &s;oon be able to unma&s;que a great many notable Figures among us, to our real Surprize.</P>
<P>Indeed 'tis a Point worth our farther Enquiry, and would be a Di&s;covery many ways to our Ad|vantage, were we ble&s;s'd with it, to &s;ee how ma|ny real <HI>Devils</HI> we have walking up and down the World in Ma&s;que, and how many Hoop-Petti|coats compleat the entire Ma&s;que that di&s;gui&s;es the Devil in the Shape of that Thing call'd Wo|man.</P>
<P>As for the Men, Nature has &s;atisfied her &s;elf in letting them be their own Di&s;gui&s;e, and in &s;uffering them to act the <HI>old Women,</HI> as old Women are vulgarly under&s;tood, in Matters of Council and Politicks; but if at any time they have Occa&s;ion for the <HI>Devil</HI> in Per&s;on, they are oblig'd to call him to their Aid in &s;uch Shape as he plea&s;es to make u&s;e of <HI>pro hac vice;</HI> and of

all tho&s;e Shapes, the mo&s;t agreeable to him &s;eems to be that of a Female of Quality, in which he has infinite Opportunity to act to Perfection, what Part &s;oever he is call'd in for.</P>
<P>How happy are tho&s;e People who they &s;ay have the particular Quality, or acquir'd Habit, call'd the <HI>Second Sight;</HI> one Sort of whom they tell us are able to di&s;tingui&s;h the <HI>Devil,</HI> in whatever Ca&s;e or Out&s;ide of Fle&s;h and Blood he is pleas'd to put on, and con&s;equently could know the <HI>De|vil</HI> wherever they met him? Were I ble&s;t with this excellent and u&s;eful Accompli&s;hment, how plea&s;ant would it be, and how would it particu|larly gratify my Spleen, and all that which I, in common with my fellow Creatures carry about me, call'd Ill-Nature, to &s;tand in the <HI>Mall,</HI> or at the Entrance to any of our <HI>A&s;&s;emblies of Beau|ties,</HI> and point them out as they pa&s;s by, with this particular Mark, That's a <HI>Devil;</HI> that fire young Toa&s;t is a <HI>Devil;</HI> There's a <HI>Devil</HI> dre&s;t in a new Habit for the Ball; There's a <HI>Devil</HI> in a Coach and Six, <HI>cum aliis.</HI> In &s;hort, it would make a merry World among us if we cou'd but enter upon &s;ome proper Method of &s;uch Di&s;cri|minations: but, <HI>Lawr'd,</HI> what a Hurricane would it rai&s;e, if, like&mdash;, who they &s;ay &s;courg'd the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;o often that he dur&s;t not come near him in any Shape whatever, we cou'd find &s;ome new Method out to make the <HI>Devil</HI> unmask, like the Angel <HI>Uriel,</HI> who, Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> &s;ays, had an enchanted Spear, with which if he did but touch the <HI>Devil,</HI> in whatever Di&s;gui&s;e he had put on, it oblig'd him immediately to &s;tart up, and &s;hew him&s;elf in his true original Shape, mere <HI>Devil</HI> as he was.</P>
<P>This would do nicely, and as I who am ori|ginally a Projector, have &s;pent &s;ome Time upon this Study, and doubt not in a little Time to fi|ni&s;h

my Engine, which I am contriving, to &s;crew the <HI>Devil</HI> out of every Body, or any Body; I que&s;tion not when I have brought it to Perfec|tion, but I &s;hall make mo&s;t excellent Di&s;coveries by it; and be&s;ides the many extraordinary Advan|tages of it to human Society, I doubt not but it will make good Sport in the World too; where|fore, when I publi&s;h my Propo&s;als, and divide it into Shares, as other le&s;s u&s;eful Projects have been done, I que&s;tion not, for all the &s;evere Act lately pa&s;s'd again&s;t Bubbles, but I &s;hall get Sub|&s;cribers enough, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, a &s;ecret Power of di&s;covering what Devils we have among us, and where and what Bu&s;ine&s;s they are doing, would be a va&s;t Advan|tage to us all; that we might know among the Crowd of <HI>Devils</HI> that walk about Streets, who are <HI>Apparitions,</HI> and who are not.</P>
<P>Now I, you mu&s;t know, at certain Inter|vals when the Old Gentleman's Illuminations are upon me, and when I have &s;omething of an <HI>E|clarici&s;&s;ement</HI> with him, have &s;ome Degrees of this di&s;criminating <HI>Second Sight,</HI> and therefore 'tis no &s;trange thing for me to tell a great many of my Acquaintance that they are really <HI>Devils,</HI> when they them&s;elves know nothing of the mat|ter: Sometimes indeed I find it pretty hard to convince them of it, or at lea&s;t they are very un|willing to own it, but it is not the le&s;s &s;o for that.</P>
<P>I had a long Di&s;cour&s;e upon this Subject one day, with a young beautiful Lady of my Acquaintance, who the World very much admired; and as the World judges no farther than they can &s;ee, (and how &s;hould they, you would &s;ay) they took her to be, as &s;he really was, a mo&s;t charming Crea|ture.</P>
<P>To me indeed &s;he di&s;cover'd her &s;elf many Ways, be&s;ides the Advantage I had of my extraordinary
<PB N="300" REF="312">
Penetraction by the magic Powers which I am ve&s;ted with: To me, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> &s;he appear'd a Fury, a Satyr, a fiery little Fiend as could po&s;&s;ibly be dre&s;s'd up in Fle&s;h; in &s;hort, &s;he appear'd to me what really &s;he was, a very DEVIL: It is natural to hu|man Creatures to de&s;ire to di&s;cover any extraordi|nary Powers they are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;uperior to others, and this Itch prevailing in me, among the re&s;t, I was impatient to let this Lady know that I un|der&s;tood her Compo&s;ition perfectly well, nay, as well as &s;he did her &s;elf.</P>
<P>In order to this, happening to be in the Fami|ly once for &s;ome Days, and having the Honour to be very intimate with her and her Husband too, I took an Opportunity on an extraordinary Occa&s;ion, when &s;he was in the Height of good Humour, to talk with her: You mu&s;t note, that, as I &s;aid, the Lady was in an extraordinary good Humour, and there had been a great deal of Mirth in the Family for &s;ome Days; but one Evening, Sir <HI>Ed&mdash;</HI>her Husband, upon &s;ome very &s;harp Turn &s;he gave to another Gentleman, which made all the Company plea&s;ant, run to her, and with a Pa&s;&s;ion of good Humour takes her in his Arms, and turning to me, &s;ays he, Jack, This Wife of mine is full of Wit and good Humour, but when &s;he has a Mind to be &s;mart, &s;he is the keene&s;t little <HI>Devil</HI> in the World: This was allu|ding to the quick Turn &s;he had given the other Gentleman.</P>
<P>Is that the be&s;t Language you can give your Wife, &s;ays my Lady? O Madam, &s;ays I, &s;uch <HI>Devils</HI> as you, are all <HI>Angels;</HI> ay, ay, &s;ays my Lady, I know that, he has only let a Truth fly out that he does not under&s;tand: Look ye there now, <HI>&s;ays Sir</HI> Edward, could any thing but &s;uch a dear <HI>Devil</HI> as this have &s;aid a thing &s;o pointed? Well, well, adds he, <HI>Devil</HI> to a Lady in a Man's Arms,

is a Word of divers Interpretations. Thus they rallied for a good while, he holding her fa&s;t all the while in his Arms, and frequently ki&s;&s;ing her, and at la&s;t it went off, all in Sun&s;hine and Mirth.</P>
<P>But the next Day, for I had the Honour to lodge in the Lady's Father's Hou&s;e, where it all happen'd; I &s;ay, the next Day my Lady begins with me upon the Subject, and that very &s;martly, &s;o that at fir&s;t I did not know whether &s;he was in je&s;t or earne&s;t: Ay, ay, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you Men make nothing of your Wives after you have them, <HI>al|luding to the Di&s;cour&s;e with</HI> Sir Edward <HI>the Night before.</HI></P>
<P>Why Madam, &s;ays I, <HI>we Men,</HI> as you are pleas'd to term it, if we meet with good Wives wor|&s;hip them, and make Idols of them, what would you have more of us?</P>
<P>No, no, &s;ays &s;he, before you have them they are Angels, but when you have been in Heaven, <HI>adds &s;he and &s;mil'd,</HI> then they are Devils.</P>
<P>Why Madam, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> Devils are Angels, you know, and were the highe&s;t Sort of Angels once.</P>
<P>Yes, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> very &s;martly, all <HI>Devils</HI> are Angels, but all Angels are not <HI>Devils.</HI></P>
<P>But Madam, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> you &s;hou'd never take it ill to be call'd <HI>Devil,</HI> you know.</P>
<P>I know, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> ha&s;tily, what d'ye mean by that?</P>
<P>Why Madam, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> and look'd very gravely and &s;erious, I thought you had known that I knew it, or el&s;e I would not have &s;aid &s;o, for I would not offend you; but you may depend I &s;hall never di&s;|cover it, unle&s;s you order me to do &s;o for your particular Service.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;he look'd har'd and wild, and bid me explain my &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="314">
I told her, I was ready to explain my &s;elf, if &s;he would give me her Word, &s;he would not re|&s;ent it, and would take nothing ill.</P>
<P>She gave me her Word &s;olemnly &s;he would not, tho' like a true <HI>Devil</HI> &s;he broke her Promi&s;e with me all at once.</P>
<P>Well however, being unconcern'd whether &s;he kept her Word or no, I began, by telling her that I had long &s;ince obtain'd the &s;econd &s;ight, and had &s;ome Years &s;tudied Magic, by which I could penetrate into many things, which to ordi|nary Preception were invi&s;ible, and had &s;ome Gla&s;&s;es, by the Help of which I could &s;ee into all vi&s;ionary or imaginary Appearances in a dif|ferent Manner than other People did.</P>
<P>Very well, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> &s;uppo&s;e you can, what's that to me?</P>
<P>I told her it was nothing to her any farther than that as &s;he knew her &s;elf to be originally not the &s;ame Creature &s;he &s;eem'd to be, but was of a &s;ublime angelic Original; &s;o by the Help of my recited Art I knew it too, and &s;o far it might re|late to her.</P>
<P>Very fine, &s;ays &s;he, &s;o you would make a <HI>De|vil</HI> of me indeed.</P>
<P>I took that Occa&s;ion to tell her, I would make nothing of her but what &s;he was; that I &s;uppos'd &s;he knew well enough God Almighty never thought fit to make any human Creature &s;o per|fect and compleatly beautiful as &s;he was, but that &s;uch were only re&s;erv'd for Figures to be a&s;&s;um'd by Angels of one Kind or another.</P>
<P>She rallied me upon that, and told me that would not bring me off, for I had not determined her for any thing Angelic, but a meer <HI>Devil;</HI> and how could I flatter her with being hand&s;ome and a <HI>Devil</HI> both at the &s;ame time?</P>
<P>I told her, as Satan, whom we abu&s;ively call'd
<PB N="303" REF="315">
<HI>Devil,</HI> was an immortal Seraph, and of an ori|ginal angelic Nature, &s;o ab&s;tracted from any thing wicked, he was a mo&s;t glorious Being; that when he thought fit to enca&s;e him&s;elf with Fle&s;h, and walk about in Di&s;gui&s;e, it was in his Power equally with the other Angels to make the Form he took upon him&s;elf be as he thought fit, beautiful or de|form'd.</P>
<P>Here &s;he di&s;puted the Po&s;&s;ibility of that, and after charging me faintly with flattering her Face, told me the Devil could not be repre&s;ented by any thing hand&s;om, alledging our con&s;tant picturing the <HI>Devil</HI> in all the frightful Appearances imagina|ble.</P>
<P>I told her we wrong'd him very much in that, and quoted St. <HI>Francis,</HI> to whom the <HI>Devil</HI> fre|quently appeared in the Form of the mo&s;t in|comparably beautiful naked Woman, to allure him, and what Means he u&s;ed to turn the Ap|pearance into a <HI>Devil</HI> again, and how he effected it.</P>
<P>She put by the Di&s;cour&s;e, and returned to that of Angels, and in&s;i&s;ted that Angels did not al|ways a&s;&s;ume beautiful Appearances; that &s;ome|times they appear'd in terrible Shapes, but that when they did not, it was at be&s;t only amiable Faces, not exqui&s;ite; and that therefore it would not hold, that to be hand&s;ome, &s;hould always render them &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>I told her the <HI>Devil</HI> had more Occa&s;ion to form Beauties than other Angels had, his Bu&s;i|ne&s;s being principally to deceive and en&s;nare Mankind. And then I gave her &s;ome Examples upon the whole.</P>
<P>I found by her Di&s;cour&s;e &s;he was willing e|nough to pa&s;s for an <HI>Angel,</HI> but 'twas the harde&s;t thing in the World to convince her that &s;he was a DEVIL, and &s;he would not come into that by any means; &s;he argued that I knew her Father,
<PB N="304" REF="316">
and that her Mother was a very good Woman, and was delivered of her in the ordinary Way, and that there was &s;uch and &s;uch Ladies who were pre&s;ent in the Room when &s;he was born, and that had often told her &s;o.</P>
<P>I told her that was nothing in &s;uch a Ca&s;e as hers; that when the Old Gentleman had occa|&s;ion to transform him&s;elf into a fine Lady, he could ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;e of a Child, and place him|&s;elf in the Cradle in&s;tead of it, when the Nur&s;e or Mother were a&s;leep; nay, or when they were broad awake either, it was the &s;ame thing to him; and I quoted <HI>Luther</HI> to her upon that Occa&s;ion, who affirms that it had been &s;o. However I &s;aid, to convince her that I knew it, (for I would have it that &s;he knew it already) if &s;he pleas'd I would go to my Chamber and fetch her my Magick Looking-gla&s;s, where &s;he &s;hould &s;ee her own Picture, not only as it was an angelick Picture for the World to admire, but a <HI>Devil</HI> al&s;o frightful enough to any Body but her &s;elf and me that under&s;tood it.</P>
<P>No, no, <HI>&s;aid &s;he,</HI> I'll look in none of your conjuring Gla&s;&s;es; I know my &s;elf well enough, and I de&s;ire to look no otherwi&s;e than I am.</P>
<P>No, Madam, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> I know that very well; nor do you need any better Shape than that you appear in, 'tis mo&s;t exqui&s;itely fine; all the World knows you are a compleat Beauty, and that is a clear Evidence what you would be if your pre&s;ent appearing Form was reduced to its proper Per&s;onality.</P>
<P><HI>Appearing Form!</HI> &s;ays &s;he, why, what would you make an <HI>Apparition</HI> of me?</P>
<P>An <HI>Apparition!</HI> Madam, &s;aid I, yes, to be &s;ure; why you know, you are nothing el&s;e but an <HI>Ap|parition;</HI> and what el&s;e would you be, when it is &s;o infinitely to your Advantage?</P>

With that, &s;he turn'd pale and angry, and then ro&s;e up ha&s;tily, and look'd into the Gla&s;s, <HI>(a large Peer-gla&s;s being in the Room)</HI> where &s;he &s;tood &s;urveying her &s;elf from Head to Foot, with Va|nity not a little.</P>
<P>I took that Time to &s;lip away, and running up into my Apartment, I fetch'd my <HI>Magic Gla&s;s,</HI> as I call'd it, in which I had a hol|low Ca&s;e &s;o framed behind a Looking-gla&s;s, that in the fir&s;t &s;he would &s;ee her own Face only; in the &s;econd, &s;he would &s;ee the <HI>De|vil</HI>'s Face, ugly and frightful enough, but dre&s;s'd up with a Lady's Head-Clothes in a Circle, the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Face in the Center, and as it were at a little Di&s;tance behind.</P>
<P>I came down again &s;o &s;oon that &s;he did not think the Time long, e&s;pecially having &s;pent it in &s;urveying her fair &s;elf; when I return'd, I &s;aid, Come, Madam, do not trouble your &s;elf to look there, that is not a Gla&s;s capable of &s;hewing you any thing; come, take this Gla&s;s.</P>
<P>It will &s;hew me as much of my &s;elf, <HI>&s;ays &s;he, a little &s;cornfully,</HI> as I de&s;ire to &s;ee; &s;o &s;he con|tinued looking in the Peer-gla&s;s; after &s;ome time more (for &s;eeing her a little out of Humour, I waited to &s;ee what Ob&s;ervations &s;he would make) I ask'd her if &s;he had view'd her &s;elf to her Sa|tisfaction? She &s;aid &s;he had, and &s;he had &s;een no|thing of <HI>Devil</HI> about her. Come, Madam, &s;aid I, look here; and with that I opened the Looking-gla&s;s, and &s;he look'd in it, but &s;aw nothing but her own Face; Well, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> the Gla&s;&s;es agree well enough, I &s;ee no Difference; what can you make of it? With that I took it a little away; Don't you? <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> then I &s;hou'd be mi&s;taken very much; &s;o I look'd in it my &s;elf, and giving it a Turn imperceptible to her, I &s;hew'd it her again, where &s;he &s;aw the <HI>Devil</HI> indeed, dre&s;s'd

<P>She &s;tarted, and cry'd out mo&s;t horribly, and told me, &s;he thought I was more of a <HI>Devil</HI> than &s;he, for that &s;he knew nothing of all tho&s;e Tricks, and I did it to fright her, &s;he believ'd I had rais'd the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>I told her it was nothing but her own natural Picture, and that &s;he knew well enough, and that I did not &s;hew it her to inform her of it, but to let her know that I knew it too; that &s;o &s;he might make no Pretences of being offended when I talk'd familiarly to her of a Thing of this Na|ture.</P>
<P>Very well; &s;o, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> I am a real frightful <HI>Devil,</HI> am I?</P>

<P>I had a great deal of farther Di&s;cour&s;e with her upon that Subject, tho' &s;he would fain have beat me off of it, and two or three times &s;he put the Talk off, and brought &s;omething el&s;e on; but I always found Means to revive it, and to attack her upon the Reality of her being a <HI>Devil,</HI> till at la&s;t I made her downright angry, and then &s;he &s;hew'd it.</P>

<P>I can't tell that, Madam, <HI>&s;aid I;</HI> that's as you agree among your &s;elves, this Kind does not go by Generation; that's a Di&s;pute foreign to the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="308" REF="320">
Then I entred into a Di&s;cour&s;e with her of the Ends and Purpo&s;es for which the <HI>Devil</HI> takes up &s;uch beautiful Forms as hers, and why it always gave me a Su&s;picion when I &s;aw a Lady hand|&s;omer than ordinary, and &s;et me upon the Search to be &s;atisfied whether &s;he was really a Woman or an <HI>Apparition?</HI> a Lady or a <HI>Devil?</HI> allowing all along that her being a <HI>Devil</HI> was quite out of the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Upon that very Foot, &s;he took me up again roundly, And &s;o, <HI>&s;ays &s;he,</HI> you are very civil to me through all your Di&s;cour&s;e, for I &s;ee it ends all in that, and you take it as a thing confe&s;t, that I am A <HI>Devil!</HI> A very pretty Piece of good U&s;age indeed! <HI>&s;ays &s;he; I thank you for it.</HI></P>
<P>Nay, Madam, <HI>&s;ays I,</HI> do not take it ill of me, for I only di&s;cover to you that I knew it; I do not tell it you as a Secret, for you are &s;atisfied of that another way.</P>
<P>Satisfied of what? &s;ays &s;he, that I am a <HI>Devil?</HI> I think the <HI>Devil</HI>'s in you: <HI>And &s;o began to be hot.</HI></P>
<P>A <HI>Devil!</HI> yes, Madam, &s;ays I, without doubt a meer DEVIL; take it as you plea&s;e, I can't help that: And &s;o I began to take it ill that &s;he &s;hould be di&s;gu&s;ted at opening &s;uch a well-known Truth to her.</P>
<P>With that &s;he di&s;covered it all at once, for &s;he turn'd <HI>Fury,</HI> in the very Letter of it; flew out in a Pa&s;&s;ion, rail'd at me, cur&s;t me mo&s;t hear|tily, and immediately di&s;appeard; which you know is the particular Mark of a Spirit or Ap|parition.</P>
<P>We had a great deal of Di&s;cour&s;e be&s;ides this, relating to &s;everal other young Ladies of her Ac|quaintance, &s;ome of which, I &s;aid, were mere <HI>Appa|ritions</HI> like her &s;elf; and told her which were &s;o, and which not; and the Rea&s;on why they were &s;o,
<PB N="309" REF="321">
and for what U&s;es and Purpo&s;es, &s;ome to delude the World one way, and &s;ome another; and &s;he was pretty well plea&s;ed to hear that, but &s;he could not bear to hear her own true Character, which however, as cunning as &s;he was, made her act the <HI>Devil</HI> at la&s;t, as you have heard; and then va|ni&s;h'd out of my &s;ight.</P>
<P>I have &s;een her in Miniature &s;everal Times &s;ince; but &s;he proves her &s;elf &s;till to be the <HI>Devil</HI> of a Lady, for &s;he bears Malice, and will never forgive me, that I would not let her be an Angel; but like a very <HI>Devil</HI> as &s;he is, &s;he endeavours to kill me at a Di&s;tance; and indeed the Poi&s;on of her Eyes, (Ba&s;ilisk-like) is very &s;trong, and &s;he has a &s;trange Influence upon me; but I that know her to be a <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;trive very hard with my &s;elf to drive the Memory of her out of my Thoughts.</P>
<P>I have had two or three Engagements &s;ince this, with other <HI>Apparitions</HI> of the &s;ame Sex, and I find they are all alike, they are willing enough to be thought Angels, but the Word <HI>Devil</HI> does not go down at all with them: But 'tis all one, whenever we &s;ee an <HI>Apparition,</HI> it is &s;o natural to &s;ay we have &s;een the <HI>Devil,</HI> that there's no pre|vailing with Mankind to talk any other Lan|guage. A Gentleman of my Acquaintance, the other Day, that had courted a Lady a long time, had the Misfortune to come a little &s;uddenly up|on her, when &s;he did not expect him, and found her in &s;uch a Rage at &s;ome of her Servants, that it quite di&s;order'd her, e&s;pecially a Footman; the Fellow had done &s;omething that was indeed pro|voking, but not &s;ufficient to put her into &s;uch a Pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;o out of her &s;elf; nor was &s;he able to re&s;train her &s;elf when &s;he &s;aw her Lover come in, but damn'd the Fellow, and rag'd like a Fu|ry at him.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="322">
My Friend did his be&s;t to compo&s;e her, and begg'd the Fellow's Pardon of her, but it would not do; nay, the poor Fellow made all the Sub|mi&s;&s;ions that could be expected, but 'twas the &s;ame thing: And &s;o the Gentleman, not caring to engage him&s;elf farther than became him, with|drew, and came no more at her for three Days, in all which time &s;he was hardly cool.</P>
<P>The next Day my Friend came to me, and talking of it in Confidence to me, I am afraid, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> I am going to marry a She <HI>Devil,</HI> and &s;o told me the Story; I took no Notice to him, but finding out his Mi&s;tre&s;s, and taking proper Mea&s;ures, with &s;ome of my particular Skill, I &s;oon found out that it was really &s;o, that &s;he was a mere <HI>Apparition;</HI> and had it not been for that accidental Di&s;order of her Pa&s;&s;ions, which di&s;co|ver'd her in&s;ide, &s;he might indeed have cheated any Man, for &s;he was a lovely <HI>Devil</HI> as ever was &s;een; &s;he talk'd like an Angel, &s;ung like a Syren, did every thing, and &s;aid every thing that was taking and charming: But what then? it $$s all Apparition, for &s;he was a mere <HI>Devil.</HI> It $Word$ true, my Friend marry'd her, and tho' &s;he was a <HI>De|vil</HI> without doubt, yet either &s;he behav'd &s;o well, or he was &s;o good, I never could hear him find Fault with her.</P>
<P>The&s;e are particular In&s;tances; but alas! I could run you a Length beyond all tho&s;e Exam|ples, and give you &s;uch a Li&s;t of <HI>Devils</HI> among the gay Things of the Town, that would fright you to think of; and you would pre&s;ently conclude, with me, that all the perfect Beauties are <HI>Devils,</HI> mere Apparitions; but Time and Paper fails, &s;o we mu&s;t only leave the Men the Caution, let them venture at their Peril. I return to the Sub|ject.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="323">
We have a great many charming <HI>Apparitions</HI> of like Kind go daily about the World in com|pleat Ma&s;querade, and, tho' we mu&s;t not &s;ay &s;o, they are in them&s;elves mere <HI>Devils,</HI> wicked dan|gerous murthering <HI>Devils,</HI> that kill various Ways, &s;ome, Ba&s;ilisk-like, with their Eyes; &s;ome, Sy|ren-like, with their Tongues; all <HI>Murtherers,</HI> even from the <HI>Beginning:</HI> It is true, 'tis pity the&s;e pretty <HI>Apparitions</HI> &s;hould be <HI>Devils,</HI> and be &s;o mi&s;chievous as they are; but &s;ince it is &s;o, I can do no le&s;s than to adverti&s;e you of it, that you may &s;hun the <HI>Devil</HI> in whatever Shape you meet with him.</P>
<P>Again, there are &s;ome half <HI>Devils,</HI> they &s;ay, like the <HI>Sagittarii,</HI> half Man, half Hor&s;e, or ra|ther, like the <HI>Satyr,</HI> who, <HI>they &s;ay,</HI> is half <HI>Devil,</HI> half Man; or, like my Lord Bi&s;hop, who, <HI>they &s;ay,</HI> was half-headed; whether they mean half-wit|ted or no, I do not find Authors agreed about it: But if they had voted him &s;uch, it had been as kind a thing as any they cou'd &s;ay of him, be|cau&s;e it would have clear'd him from the Scandal of being a <HI>Devil,</HI> or half a <HI>Devil,</HI> for we don't find the <HI>Devil</HI> makes any Alliance with F&mdash;ls.</P>
<P>Then as to merry Devils, there's my Ma&s;ter <HI>G&mdash;,</HI> he may indeed have the <HI>Devil</HI> in him, but it mu&s;t be &s;aid, to the Credit of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in general, that Satan would have &s;corn'd to have entred into a Soul &s;o narrow that there was not room to hold him, or to take up with &s;o di&s;cord|ing a Creature, &s;o abject, &s;o &s;coundrel, as never made a Figure among Mankind greater than that of a Thief, a <HI>Moroder,</HI> moulded up into Quality, and a Raparee dre&s;s'd up <HI>a-la-Ma&s;que,</HI> with a <HI>Robe</HI> and a <HI>Coronet.</HI></P>
<P>Some little Dog-kennel <HI>Devil</HI> may indeed take up his Quarters in or near him, and &s;o run into and out of him as his Drum beats a Call; but
<PB N="312" REF="324">
to him that was born a <HI>Devil,</HI> Satan, that never acts to no purpo&s;e, cou'd not think him worth being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by any thing better than a Devil of a dirty Quality; that is to &s;ay, a Spirit too mean to wear the Name of <HI>Devil,</HI> without &s;ome Badge or Addition of Infamy and Meanne&s;s to di&s;tingui&s;h it by.</P>
<P>Thus what <HI>Devil</HI> of Quality would be con|fin'd to a <HI>P&mdash;n,</HI> who inheriting all the Pride and In&s;olence of his Ance&s;tors, without one of their good Qualities; the Bully, the <HI>Bil|lingsgate,</HI> and all the hereditary ill Language of his Family, without an Ounce of their Courage; that has been re&s;cued five or &s;ix times from the Scandal of a Coward, by the Bravery, and at the Hazard of Friends, and never fail'd to be un|grateful; that if ever he committed a Murther, did it in cold Blood, becau&s;e no Body could prove he ever had any hot; who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Poltroon <HI>Devil,</HI> was always wickeder in the Dark, than he dur&s;t be by Day-light; and who, after innumer|able pa&s;&s;ive Sufferings, has been turned out of hu|man Society, becau&s;e he could not be kick'd or cuff'd either into good Manners or good Hu|mour.</P>
<P>To &s;ay this was a <HI>Devil,</HI> an Apparition, or even a half <HI>Devil,</HI> would be unkind to <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf, &s;ince tho' he (the <HI>Devil)</HI> has &s;o many Millions of inferior <HI>Devils</HI> under his Command, not one cou'd be found ba&s;e enough to match him, nor one <HI>Devil</HI> found but what would think him|&s;elf di&s;honour'd to be employ'd about him.</P>
<P>Some merry good-for-nothing <HI>Devils</HI> we have indeed, which we might, if we had room, &s;peak of at large, and divert you too with the Relation, &s;uch as my Lady <HI>Hatt</HI>'s <HI>Devil</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who up|on laying a Joiner's Mallet in the Window of a certain Chamber, would come very orderly and
<PB N="313" REF="325">
knock with it all Night upon the Window, or again&s;t the Wain&s;cot, and di&s;turb the Neighbour|hood, and then go away in the Morning, as well &s;atisfied as may be; whereas if the Mallet was not left, he would think him&s;elf affronted, and be as un&s;ufferable and terrifying as po&s;&s;ible, breaking the Windows, &s;plitting the Wain&s;cot, committing all the Di&s;orders, and doing all the Damage that he was able to the Hou&s;e, and to the Goods in it. And again, &s;uch as the Drum|ing <HI>Devil</HI> in the Well at <HI>Oundle</HI> in <HI>Northampton|&s;hire,</HI> and &s;uch like.</P>
<P>A great many antick <HI>Devils</HI> have been &s;een al|&s;o, who &s;eem'd to have little or nothing to do, but only to a&s;&s;ure us that they can appear if they plea&s;e, and that there is a Reality in the thing call'd Apparition.</P>
<P>As to Shadows of <HI>Devils,</HI> and imaginary Ap|pearances, &s;uch as appear, and yet are invi&s;ible at the &s;ame time, I had thought to have be&s;tow'd a Chapter upon them by them&s;elves, but it may be as much to the purpo&s;e to let them alone, as to meddle with them; 'tis &s;aid our old Friend <HI>Lu|ther</HI> u&s;ed to be exceedingly troubled with &s;uch invi&s;ible Apparitions, and he tells us much of them, in what they call his Table-talk; but with Ma&s;ter <HI>Luther</HI>'s Leave, tho' the <HI>Devil</HI> pa&s;&s;es for a very great Lyar, I could &s;wallow many things of his own proper making, as &s;oon as &s;ome of tho&s;e I find in a Book that goes by his Name, particularly the Story of the Devil in a Basket, the Child flying out of the Cradle, and the like.</P>
<P>In a word, the walking <HI>Devils</HI> that we have generally among us, are of the female Sex; whe|ther it be that the <HI>Devil</HI> finds le&s;s Difficulty to manage them, or that he lives quieter with them, or that they are fitter for his Bu&s;ine&s;s than the
<PB N="314" REF="326">
Men, I &s;hall not now enter into a Di&s;pute about that; perhaps he goes better di&s;guis'd in the fair Sex than otherwi&s;e; Antiquity gives us many Hi&s;tories of She-Devils, &s;uch as we can very &s;eldom match for Wickedne&s;s among the Men; &s;uch now as in the Text, <HI>Lot</HI>'s Daughters, <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI>'s Mi&s;tre&s;s, <HI>Samp&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Dallilah, Herod</HI>'s <HI>Hero|dias,</HI> the&s;e were certainly <HI>Devils,</HI> or play'd the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;ufficiently in their Turn; one Male Apparition indeed the Scripture furni&s;hes you with, and that is <HI>Judas;</HI> for his Ma&s;ter &s;ays ex|pre&s;ly of him, <HI>One of you is a Devil;</HI> not has the <HI>Devil,</HI> or is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the DEVIL; but really is a DEVIL, or is a real DEVIL.</P>
<P>How happy is it, that this great Secret comes thus to be di&s;cover'd to Mankind? Certainly the World has gone on in Ignorance a long time, and at a &s;trange rate, that we &s;hould have &s;o many <HI>Devils</HI> continually walking about among us in human Shape, and we know it not.</P>
<P>Philo&s;ophers tell us that there is a World of Spirits, and many learned Pieces of Gue&s;s-work they make at it, repre&s;enting the World to be &s;o near us, that the Air, as they de&s;cribe it, mu&s;t be full of Dragons and <HI>Devils,</HI> enough to fright our Imaginations with the very Thoughts of them; and if they &s;ay true, 'tis our great Felicity that we cannot &s;ee any farther into it than we do, which if we could, would appear as frightful as Hell it&s;elf; but none of tho&s;e Sages ever told us, till now, that half the People we conver&s;e with are <HI>Apparitions,</HI> e&s;pecially of the Women; and among them e&s;pecially this valu|able Part, the Women of Figure, the fair, the beautiful, or the patch'd and painted.</P>
<P>This unu&s;ual Phaenomenon has been &s;een but a little while, and but a little way, and the general Part of Mankind cannot come into the &s;ame No|tions
<PB N="315" REF="327">
about it; nay, perhaps they will all think it &s;trange; but be it as &s;trange as it will, the Na|ture of the Thing confirms it, this lower Sphere is full of <HI>Devils;</HI> and &s;ome of both Sexes have given &s;trange Te&s;timonies of the Reality of their pre-exi&s;tent <HI>Devili&s;m</HI> for many Ages pa&s;t, tho' I think it never came to that Height as it has now.</P>
<P>It is true, in former times Satan dealt much in old Women, and tho&s;e, as I have ob&s;erv'd alrea|dy, very ugly, <HI>Ugly as a Witch, Black as a Witch, I l$ok like a Witch,</HI> all proverbial Speeches, and which te&s;tify'd what Tools it was Satan generally work'd with; and the&s;e old Spectres, they tell us, us'd to ride thro' the Air in the Night, and upon Broom&s;ticks too, all mighty homely Doings; $Word$ &s;ay they us'd to go to vi&s;it their Grand beignior the <HI>Devil,</HI> in tho&s;e Nocturnal Perambu|lations: But be that as it will, 'tis certain the <HI>Devil</HI> has chang'd hands, and that now he walks $Word$ the World cloth'd in Beauty, cover'd with the Charms of the Lovely, and he fails not to di&s;gui&s;e him&s;elf effectually by it, for who would think a beautiful Lady could be a Ma&s;que to the Devil? and that a fine Face, a divine Shape, a heavenly A&s;pect, &s;hould bring the <HI>Devil</HI> in her Company, nay, &s;hould be her&s;elf an <HI>Apparition,</HI> a mere DEVIL?</P>
<P>The Enquiry is indeed worth our while, and therefore I hope all the enamour'd Beaus and Boys, all the Beauty-hunters and Fortune-hunters, will take heed, for I &s;uppo&s;e if they get the <HI>De|vil,</HI> they will not complain for want of a For|tune; and there's Danger enough, I a&s;&s;ure you, for the World is full of Apparitions, <HI>non ro&s;a &s;ine &s;pinis;</HI> not a Beauty without a <HI>Devil,</HI> the old Women Spectres, and the young Women Apparitions; the ugly ones Witches, and the

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Of the Cloven-Foot walking about the World without the</HI> Devil, (viz.) <HI>of Witches making Bargains for the</HI> Devil, <HI>and par|ticularly of &s;elling the Soul to the</HI> Devil.</HEAD>
<P>I Have dwelt long upon the <HI>Devil</HI> in Ma&s;que, as he goes about the World incog, and e&s;pe|cially without his Cloven-Foot, and have touch|ed upon &s;ome of his Di&s;gui&s;es in the Manage|ment of his Intere&s;t in the World; I mu&s;t &s;ay &s;ome of his Di&s;gui&s;es only, for who can give a full account of all his Tricks and Arts in &s;o nar|row a Compa&s;s as I am pre&s;crib'd to?</P>
<P>But as I &s;aid, that every <HI>Devil</HI> has not a Clo|ven-Foot, &s;o I mu&s;t add now for the pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, that every Cloven-Foot is not the Devil.</P>
<P>Not but that wherever I &s;hould meet the Clo|ven-Hoof, I &s;hould expect that the <HI>Devil</HI> was not far off, and &s;hould be apt to rai&s;e the Po&s;&s;e again&s;t him, to apprehend him; yet it may happen other|wi&s;e, that's certain; every Coin has its Counter|feit, every Art its Pretender, every Whore her Admirer, every Error its Patron, and every Day has its DEVIL.</P>
<P>I have had &s;ome Thought of making a full and compleat Di&s;covery here of that great Doubt which has &s;o long puzzl'd the World, namely, whether there is any &s;uch Thing, as &s;ecret making Bargains with the Devil, and the fir&s;t po&s;itive A&s;&s;urance I can give you in the Ca&s;e, is, that if
<PB N="317" REF="329">
there is not, 'tis not his Fault, 'tis not for want of his Endeavour, 'tis plain, if you will pardon me for taking &s;o mean a Step, as that of quoting Scripture; I &s;ay, 'tis evident he would fain have made a Contract with our Savour, and he bid boldly <HI>(give him his Due)</HI> namely, <HI>all the King|doms of the World</HI> for <HI>one bend of his Knee:</HI> Im|pudent Seraph! To think thy Lord &s;hould pay thee Homage! How many would agree with him here for a le&s;s Price! They &s;ay, <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> &s;truck a Bargain with him, and that he gave <HI>Oliver</HI> the Protector&s;hip, but would not let him call him&s;elf King, which &s;tuck &s;o clo&s;e to that <HI>Furio&s;o,</HI> that the Mortification &s;pread into his Soul, and 'tis &s;aid, he dy'd of a Gangreen in the Spleen. But take Notice and do <HI>Oliver</HI> Ju&s;tice; I do not vouch the Story, neither does the Bi|&s;hop &s;ay one Word of it.</P>
<P>Fame us'd to &s;ay, that the old famous Duke of <HI>Luxemburg</HI> made a Magic compact of this Kind; nay, I have heard many an (old Woman) Officer of the Troops, who never car'd to &s;ee his Face, de|clare that he carry'd the Devil at his Back. I re|member a certain Author of a News Paper in <HI>Lon|don</HI> was once taken up, and they &s;ay, it co&s;t him 50 <HI>l.</HI> for printing in his News, that <HI>Luxemburg</HI> was <HI>Humpback'd.</HI> Now if I have &s;olv'd the Dif|ficulty, namely, that he was not hump'd, only carry'd the <HI>Devil</HI> at his Back; I think the poor Man &s;hould have his 50 <HI>l.</HI> again, or I &s;hould have it for the Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s, I do not well under&s;tand this com|pacting with &s;uch a Fellow as can neither write nor read; nor do I know who is the Scrivener between them, or how the Indenture can be exe|cuted; but that which is wor&s;e than all the re&s;t is, that in <HI>the fir&s;t Place,</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> never keeps Articles; he will contract perhaps, and they &s;ay
<PB N="318" REF="330">
he is mighty forward to make Conditions; but who &s;hall bind him to the Performance, and where is the Penalty if he fails? if we agree with him, he will be apt enough to claim his Bargain and de|mand Payment; nay, perhaps before it is due; but who &s;hall make him &s;tand to his Word?</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, he is a Knave in his Dealing, for he really promi&s;es what he cannot perform; wit|ne&s;s his impudent Propo&s;al to our Lord mention|ed above, <HI>All the&s;e Kingdoms will I give</HI> thee! <HI>Lying Spirit!</HI> Why they were none of thine to give, no not one of them; for the Earth is the Lords and the Kingdoms thereof, nor were they in his Power any more than in his Right: So (I have heard that) &s;ome poor di&s;mal Creatures have &s;old them&s;elves to the Devil for a Sum of Money, for &s;o much Ca&s;h, and yet even in that Ca&s;e, when the Day of Payment came, I never heard that he brought his Money or paid the Purcha&s;e, &s;o that he is a Scoundrel in his Treaties, for you &s;hall tru&s;t for your Bargain, but not be able to get your Money; and yet for your Part, he comes for you to an Hour: <HI>Of which by it &s;elf.</HI></P>
<P>In a Word, let me caution you all, when you trade with the Devil, either get the Price or quit the Bargain; the <HI>Devil</HI> is a cunning Shaver, he will wriggle him&s;elf out of the Performance on his Side if po&s;&s;ible, and yet expect you &s;hould be punctual on your Side. They tell you of a poor Fellow in <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> that offer'd to &s;ell his Soul to him for a Cow, and though the <HI>De|vil</HI> promi&s;ed, and as they &s;ay, &s;ign'd the Writ|ings, yet the poor Countryman could never get the Cow of him, but &s;till as he brought a Cow to him, &s;ome body or other came and challeng'd it, proving that it was lo&s;t or &s;tolen from them; &s;o that the Man got nothing but the Name of a Cow-&s;tealer, and was at la&s;t carried to <HI>Hereford</HI>
<PB N="319" REF="331">
Jail, and condemn'd to be hang'd for &s;tealing two Cows, one after the other: The wicked Fellow was then in the greate&s;t Di&s;tre&s;s imaginable, he &s;ummon'd his <HI>Devil</HI> to help him out, but he fail|ed him, as the <HI>Devil</HI> always will; he really had not &s;tolen the Cows, but they were found in his Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and he could give no Account how he came by them; at la&s;t he was driven to confe&s;s the Truth, told the horrid Bargain he had made, and how the <HI>Devil</HI> often promis'd him a Cow, but never gave him one, except that &s;everal Times in the Morning early he found a Cow put into his Yard, but it always prov'd to belong to &s;ome of his Neighbours: Whether the Man was hang'd or no, the Story does not relate; but this Part is to my Purpo&s;e, that they make Bargains with the <HI>Devil,</HI> ought to make him give Secu|rity for the Performance of Covenants, and who the Devil would get to be bound for him, I can't tell, they mu&s;t look to that who make the Bar|gain: Be&s;ides, if he had not had a Mind to cheat or baffle the poor Man, what need he have taken a Cow &s;o near home? if he had &s;uch and &s;uch Fowers as we talk of, and as Fancy and Fable fur|ni&s;h for him, could not he have carried a Cow in the Air upon a Broom-&s;tick, as well as an old Woman? Could he not have &s;tole a Cow for him in <HI>Lincoln&s;hire,</HI> and &s;et it down in <HI>Hereford&s;hire,</HI> and &s;o have perform'd his Bargain, &s;av'd his Credit, and kept the poor Man out of Trouble? &s;o that if the Story is True, as I really believe it is, either it is not the Devil that makes tho&s;e Bargains, or the Devil has not &s;uch Power as we be&s;tow on him, except on &s;pecial Occa&s;ions he gets a Per|mit, and is bid go, as in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Job,</HI> the <HI>Gadaren Hogs,</HI> and the like.</P>
<P>We have another Example of a Man's &s;elling him&s;elf to the <HI>Devil,</HI> that is very remarkable, and
<PB N="320" REF="332">
that is in the Bible too, and even in that, I do not find, what the <HI>Devil</HI> did for him, in Payment of the purcha&s;e Price. The Per&s;on &s;elling was <HI>Ahab,</HI> of whom the Text &s;ays expre&s;sly, <HI>there was none like</HI> him, <HI>who did &s;ell him&s;elf to work Wickedne&s;s in the Sight of the</HI> LORD, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> xxi. 20, and the 25. I think it might have been ren|dred, if not tran&s;lated <HI>in Spight of the Lord,</HI> or <HI>in Defiance of God;</HI> for certainly that's the Mean|ing of it; and now allowing me to preach a lit|tle upon this Text, my Sermon &s;hall be very &s;hort. <HI>Ahab</HI> &s;old him&s;elf, who did he &s;ell him|&s;elf to? I an&s;wer that Que&s;tion by a Que&s;tion; who would buy him? who, <HI>as we &s;ay,</HI> would give any thing for him? and the An&s;wer to that is plain al&s;o, you may judge of the Purcha&s;er by the Work he was to do; he that buys a Slave in the Market, buys him to work for him, and to do &s;uch Bu&s;ine&s;s as he has for him to do: <HI>Ahab</HI> was bought to work Wickedne&s;s, and who would buy him for that but the <HI>Devil?</HI></P>
<P>I think there's no room to doubt but <HI>Ahab</HI> &s;old him&s;elf to the Devil; the Text is plain that he &s;old him&s;elf, and the Work he was &s;old to do points out the Ma&s;ter that bought him; what Price he agreed with the <HI>Devil</HI> for, that indeed the Text is &s;ilent in, &s;o we may let it alone, nor it much to our Purpo&s;e, unle&s;s it be to enquire whether the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;tood to his Bargain or not, and whether he paid the Money according to A|greement, or cheated him as he did the Farmer at <HI>Here&s;ord.</HI></P>
<P>This buying and &s;elling between the <HI>Devil</HI> and us, is, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, an odd kind of Stock-jobbing, and indeed the <HI>Devil</HI> may be &s;aid to &s;ell the <HI>Bear-skin,</HI> whatever he buys; but the &s;trange&s;t Part is when he comes to demand the tran&s;fer; for as I hint|ed before, whether he Performs or no, he expects
<PB N="321" REF="333">
his Bargain to a Tittle; there is indeed &s;ome Dif|ficulty in re&s;olving how and in what Manner Payment is made; the Stories we meet with in our Chimney-Corner Hi&s;tories, and which are &s;o many Ways made U&s;e of to make the <HI>Devil</HI> frightful to us and our Heirs for ever, are general|ly &s;o fooli&s;h and ridiculous, as, if true or not true, they have nothing Material in them, are of no Signification, or el&s;e &s;o impo&s;&s;ible in their Na|ture, that they make no Impre&s;&s;ion upon any body above twelve Years old and under &s;eventy; or el&s;e are &s;o tragical that Antiquity has fabled them down to our Ta&s;te, that we might be able to hear them and repeat them with le&s;s Horror than is due to them.</P>
<P>This Variety has taken off our Reli&s;h of the Thing in general, and made the Trade of Soul|&s;elling, like our late more eminent Bubbles, be taken to be a Cheat and to have little in it.</P>
<P>However, to &s;peak a little more gravely to it, I cannot &s;ay but that &s;ince, by the two eminent In&s;tances of it above in <HI>Ahab,</HI> and in Chri&s;t him|&s;elf, the Fact is evidently a&s;certain'd; and that the Devil has attempted to make &s;uch a Bargain on one, and actually did make it with the other, The Po&s;&s;ibility of it is not to be di&s;pu|ted; but then I mu&s;t explain the Manner of it a little, and bring it down, nearer to our Under|&s;tanding, that it may be more intelligible than it is; for as for this &s;elling the Soul, and making a Bargain to give the <HI>Devil</HI> Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion by Livery and Sei&s;in on the Day appointed, that I cannot come into by any Means; no nor into the other Part, namely, of the Devil coming to claim his Bar|gain, and to demand the Soul according to Agree|ment, and upon Default of a fair Delivery, taking it away by Violence <HI>Ca&s;e and all,</HI> of which we have many hi&s;torical Relations pretty current among
<PB N="322" REF="334">
us; &s;ome of which, <HI>for ought I know,</HI> we might have hop'd had been true, if we had not been &s;ure they were fal&s;e, and others we had Rea&s;on to fear were fal&s;e, becau&s;e it was impo&s;&s;ible they &s;hould be true.</P>
<P>The Bargains of this Kind, according to the be&s;t Accounts we have of them, u&s;ed to con&s;i&s;t of two main Articles, according to the ordinary Stipulations in all Covenants; namely,</P>
<P N="1">1. Something to be perform'd on the Devil's Part, buying.</P>
<P N="2">2. Something to be perform'd on the Man's Part, &s;elling.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Devil</HI>'s Part: This was generally &s;ome poor Trifle, for the Devil generally bought good Penny-worths, and oftentimes like a compleat Shar|per, agreed to give what he was not able to procure; that is to &s;ay, would bargain for a Price he could not pay, as in the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Hereford</HI> Man and the Cow; for Example, 1. <HI>Long Life:</HI> This tho' the deluded Chapman has often had folly enough to contract for, the Devil never had Power to make good; and we have a famous Story, how true I know not, of a Wretch that &s;old him&s;elf to the DEVIL on Condition he, <HI>Satan,</HI> &s;hould a&s;&s;ure him (1.) That he &s;hould never want Victu|als; (2.) That he &s;hould never be a cold; (3.) That he &s;hould always come to him when he call'd him; and (4.) That he &s;hould let him live one and twenty Years, and then Satan was at Liberty to have him; that is, I &s;uppo&s;e, to take him where|ever he could find him.</P>
<P>It &s;eems, the Fellow's de&s;ire to be a&s;&s;ur'd of 21 Years Life, was chiefly, that during that Time, he might be as wicked as he would, and &s;hould yet be &s;ure not to be hang'd, nay, to be free from all Puni&s;hment; upon this Foot 'tis &s;aid he com|menc'd Rogue, and committed a great many Rob|beries
<PB N="323" REF="335">
and other villanious Things; now it &s;eems the <HI>Devil</HI> was pretty true to his Bargain in &s;everal of tho&s;e things; particularly, that two or three times when the Fellow was taken up for petty Crimes, and call'd for his old Friend, he came and fright|ed the Con&s;tables &s;o, that they let the Offender get away from them: But at Length having done &s;ome capital Crime, a Set of Con&s;tables, or &s;uch like Officers, &s;eiz'd upon him, who were not to be frighted with the <HI>Devil,</HI> in what Shape &s;oever he appear'd; &s;o that they carry'd him off, and he was committed to <HI>Newgate</HI> or &s;ome other Pri&s;on as effectual.</P>
<P>Nor could Satan with all his Skill unlock his Fetters, much le&s;s the Pri&s;on Doors; But he was try'd, convicted, and executed. The Fel|low in his Extremity, <HI>they &s;ay,</HI> expo&s;tulated with the <HI>Devil</HI> for his Bargain, the Term of 21 Years it &s;eems not being expir'd. But the <HI>Devil,</HI> it is &s;aid, &s;huffl'd with him, told him a good while, he would get him out, bid him have Patience and &s;tay a little, and thus led him on, till he came as it were within Sight of the Gallows, that is to &s;ay, within a Day or two of his Execution; when the <HI>Devil</HI> cavill'd upon his Bargain, told him, he agreed to let him live 21 Years, and he had not hindred him, but that he did not Co|venant to cau&s;e him to live that Time; that there was a great deal of Difference between doing and &s;uffering; that he was to &s;uffer him to live, and that he did; but he could not make him live when he had brought him&s;elf to the Gallows.</P>
<P>Whether this Story were true or not, for you mu&s;t not expect we Hi&s;torians &s;hould an&s;wer for the Di&s;cour&s;e between the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Chaps, becau&s;e we were not privy to the Bargain: I &s;ay, whether it was true or not, the Inference is to our Purpo&s;e &s;everal Ways.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="324" REF="336">
1. It confirms what I have &s;aid of the Knavery of the <HI>Devil</HI> in his Dealings, and that when he has Stock - jobb'd with us on the be&s;t Conditions he can get, he very &s;eldom per|forms his Bargain.</P>
<P N="2">2. It confirms what I have likewi&s;e &s;aid, that the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Power is limited; with this Addi|tion, that he not only cannot de&s;troy the Life of Man, but that he cannot pre&s;erve it; <HI>in &s;hort,</HI> he can neither prevent or bring on our De&s;truction.</P>
<P>I may be allow'd, I hope, for the Sake of the pre|&s;ent Di&s;cour&s;e, to &s;uppo&s;e that the <HI>Devil</HI> would have been &s;o ju&s;t to this wicked, tho' fooli&s;h Crea|ture, as to have &s;av'd him from the Gallows if he could; but it &s;eems, he at la&s;t acknowledg'd that it was not in his Power; nay, he could not keep him from being taken and carry'd to Pri&s;on, af|ter he was gotten into the Hands of a bold Fel|low or two, that were not be &s;car'd with his Blu&s;ter, as &s;ome fooli&s;h Creatures had been before.</P>
<P>And how &s;imple, how weak, how unlike any Thing of an Angelic Nature, was it to attempt to &s;ave the poor Wretch, only by little Noi&s;es and &s;ham Appearances, putting out the Candles, ru&s;hing and jo&s;teling in the Dark, <HI>and the like!</HI> If the <HI>Devil</HI> was that mighty Seraph, which we have heard of, if he is a God of this World, a Prince of the Air, a Spirit able to de&s;troy Cities and make Havock in the World; if he can rai&s;e Tem|pe&s;ts and Storms, throw Fire about the World, and do wonderful Things, as an unchain'd <HI>Devil</HI> no Doubt could do; what need all this Frippery? and what need he try &s;o many ridiculous Ways, by the Emptine&s;s, nay, the &s;illy non&s;en&s;ical Manner, of which, he &s;hews, that he is able to do no better,
<PB N="325" REF="337">
and that his Power is extingui&s;h'd? <HI>In a Word,</HI> he would certainly act otherwi&s;e, if he could. <HI>Sed caret pedibus,</HI> he wants Power.</P>
<P>How weak a Thing is it then, for any Man to expect Performance from the <HI>Devil?</HI> If he has not Power to do Mi&s;chief, which is his Element, his very Nature, and on many Accounts, is the very &s;um of his De&s;ires. How &s;hould he have Power to do Good? how Power to deliver from Danger or from Death? which Deliverance would be in it&s;elf a Good, and we know it is not in his Nature to do Good to or for any Man?</P>
<P>In a Word, the <HI>Devil</HI> is &s;trangely impudent, to think that any Man &s;hould depend upon him for the Performance of an Agreement of any Kind whatever, when he knows him&s;elf, that he is not able, if he was hone&s;t enough, to be as good as his Word.</P>
<P>Come we next to his expecting our Perform|ance to him; tho' he is not &s;o ju&s;t to us, yet, it &s;eems, he never fails to come and demand Pay|ment of us at the very Day appointed: He was but a weak Trader in Things of this Nature, who having &s;old his Soul to the <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;o our old Women's Tales call the Thing, and when the <HI>Devil</HI> came to demand his Bargain, put it off as a Thing of no Force, for that it was done &s;o long ago, he thought he <HI>(the Devil)</HI> had forgot it. It was a better An&s;wer, which they tell us, a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Divine gave the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Name of a poor Wretch, who had &s;old him&s;elf to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and who was in a terrible Fright about his coming for his Bargain, as he might well be indeed, if the <HI>Devil</HI> has &s;uch a Power, as really to come and take it by Force. <HI>The Story (if you can bear a &s;erious one) is this.</HI></P>
<P>The Man was in great Horror of Mind, and the Family fear'd he would de&s;troy him&s;elf; at
<PB N="326" REF="338">
length they &s;ent for a <HI>Lutheran</HI> Mini&s;ter to talk with him, and who after &s;ome Labour with him, got out the Truth <HI>(viz.)</HI> that he had &s;old him&s;elf to the <HI>Devil,</HI> and that the Time was almo&s;t expir'd, when he expected the <HI>Devil</HI> would come and &s;etch him away, and he was &s;ure he would not fail coming to the Time to a Minute; the Mini&s;ter fir&s;t endeavour'd to convince him of the horrid Crime, and to bring him to a true Penitence for that Part; and having as he thought made him a &s;incere Penitent, he then began to encourage him, and particularly, de&s;ir'd of him, that when the Time was come, that the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hould fetch him away, he, the Mini&s;ter, &s;hould be in the Hou&s;e with him; accordingly, to make the Story &s;hort, the Time came, the <HI>Devil</HI> came, and the Mini&s;ter was pre&s;ent, when the <HI>Devil</HI> came; what Shape he was in, the Story does not &s;ay; the Man &s;aid he &s;aw him, and cry'd out; the Mini&s;ter could not &s;ee him, but the Man affirming he was in the Room, the Mini|&s;ter &s;aid aloud, <HI>in the Name of the</HI> living God, <HI>Satan, what come&s;t thou here for?</HI> The <HI>Devil</HI> an&s;wer'd, <HI>I come for my own;</HI> the Mini&s;ter an|&s;wer'd, <HI>He is not thy own, for Je&s;us Chri&s;t has re|deem'd him, and in his Name I charge thee to avoid and touch him not;</HI> at which, &s;ays the Story, the <HI>Devil</HI> gave a furious Stamp (with his Cloven-Foot I &s;uppo&s;e) and went away, and was never known to mole&s;t him afterward.</P>
<P>Another Story, tho' it be in it &s;elf a long one, I &s;hall abridge (for your reading with the le&s;s Unea&s;ine&s;s) as follows.</P>
<P>A young Gentleman of<HI>&mdash;berg,</HI> in the Elector of <HI>Brandenburgh</HI>'s (now the King of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI>'s) Dominions, being deeply in Love with a beautiful Lady, but &s;omething above his Fortune, and whom he could by no Means bring to love him again,
<PB N="327" REF="339">
apply'd him&s;elf to an <HI>old thing</HI> call'd <HI>a Witch,</HI> for her A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and promi&s;ed her great Things, if &s;he could bring the Lady to love him, or any how compa&s;s her, &s;o as he might have his Will of her; nay, at la&s;t he told her he would give up his Soul to her, if &s;he would an&s;wer his De&s;ire.</P>
<P>The old Hag, it &s;eems, having had &s;ome of his Money, had very hone&s;tly tried what &s;he could do, but all to no Purpo&s;e, the Lady would not comply; but when he offer'd &s;uch a great Price, &s;he told him, &s;he would con&s;ider farther again&s;t &s;uch a Time, and &s;o appointed him the next Even|ing.</P>
<P>At the Time appointed he comes, and the Witch made a long Speech to him upon the Ni|cety of the Affair; I &s;uppo&s;e to prepare him not to be &s;urpriz'd at what was to come; for &s;he &s;uppos'd he was not &s;o very de&s;perately bent as he appear'd to be; &s;he told him it was a Thing of very great Difficulty; but as he had made &s;uch a great Offer, of <HI>&s;elling his Soul for it,</HI> &s;he had an Acquaintance in the Hou&s;e, who was better skill'd (than &s;he was) in &s;uch particular Things, and would treat with him farther, and &s;he doubted not but that both together might an&s;wer his End. The Fellow it &s;eems was &s;till of the &s;ame Mind, and told her, he car'd not what he pawn'd or &s;old, if he could but obtain the Lady; well, &s;ays the old Hag, &s;it &s;till a while, and with that &s;he withdraws.</P>
<P>By and by &s;he comes in again with a Que&s;tion in her Mouth; pray, &s;ays &s;he, do you &s;eek this Lady for a Wife, or for a Mi&s;tre&s;s, would you marry her, or would you only lie with her? The young Man told her <HI>no, no,</HI> he did not expect &s;he would lie with him, therefore he would be &s;atisfied to marry her, but asks her the Rea&s;on of the Que&s;tion; why truly, &s;ays the old Hag, my
<PB N="328" REF="340">
Rea&s;on is very Weighty; for if you would have her for your Wife, I doubt, we can do you no Service; but if you have a Mind to lie with her, the Per&s;on, I &s;peak of, will undertake it.</P>
<P>The Man was &s;urpriz'd at that, only he objected that this was a tran&s;ient or &s;hort Felicity, and that he &s;hould perhaps have her no more; the old Hag bid him not fear, but that if &s;he once yielded to be his Whore, he might have her as often as he plea&s;ed; upon this he con&s;ents, for he was &s;tark mad for the Lady; He having con&s;ented, &s;he told him then, he &s;hould follow her, but told him, whoever he &s;aw, he mu&s;t &s;peak to no body but her, till &s;he gave him leave, and that he &s;hould not be &s;urpriz'd, whatever happen'd, for no hurt &s;hould befall him; all which he agreed to, and the old Woman going out he follow'd her.</P>
<P>Being upon this led into another Room, where there was but very little Light, yet enough to let him &s;ee that there was no body in it but him&s;elf and the Woman, he was de&s;ired to &s;it down in a Chair next to a Table, and the old Woman clapping the Door too after her, he asked her why &s;he &s;hut the Door, and where was the Per&s;on &s;he told him of? At which &s;he an&s;wer'd, <HI>there he is,</HI> pointing to a Chair at a lit|tle Di&s;tance: The young Gentleman turning his Head, &s;aw a grave Kind of a Man &s;itting in an Elbow-Chair, tho' he &s;aid, he could have &s;worn there was no body in the Chair when the old Wo|man &s;hut the Door; however, having promis'd not to &s;peak to any body but the old Woman, he &s;aid not a Word.</P>
<P>By and by the Woman making abundance of &s;trange Ge&s;tures and Motions, and mumbling over &s;everal Things which he could not under&s;tand, on a &s;uddain a large Wicker-Chair, which &s;tood by the Chimney, removes to the other End of
<PB N="329" REF="341">
the Table which he &s;at by, but there was no body in the Chair; in about two Minutes after that the Chair remov'd, there appear'd a Per&s;on &s;it|ting in that too, who, the Room being, as is &s;aid, almo&s;t dark, could not be &s;o di&s;tingui&s;h'd by the Eye, as to &s;ee his Countenance.</P>
<P>After &s;ome while, the fir&s;t Man, and the Chair he &s;at in, mov'd, as if they had been one Body, to the Table al&s;o; and the old Woman and the two Men &s;eem'd to talk together, but the young Man could not under&s;tand any Thing they &s;aid; after &s;ome Time the old Witch turn'd to the young Gentleman, told him his Reque&s;t was granted, but not for Marriage, but the Lady &s;hould love and receive him.</P>
<P>The Witch then gave him a Stick dipt in Tat at both Ends, and bid him hold it to a Candle, which he did, and in&s;tead of burning like a Stick it burnt out like a Torch; then &s;he bid him break it of in the Middle, and light the other End; he did that too, and all the Room &s;eem'd to be in a light Flame; then &s;he &s;aid, deliver one Piece here, pointing to one only of the Per&s;ons, &s;o he gave the fir&s;t Fire-&s;tick to the fir&s;t Man or <HI>Apparition;</HI> now &s;ays &s;he, deliver the other here, &s;o he gave the other Piece to the other Apparition, at which they both ro&s;e up and &s;poke to him Words, which he &s;aid he under&s;tood not, and could not repeat and immediately vani&s;h'd with the Fire-&s;ticks and all, leaving the Room full of Smoke: I do not remember that the Story &s;ays any Thing of Brim&s;tone, or the &s;mell of it, but it &s;ays the Door continu'd fa&s;t lock'd, and no body was left in the Room but the young Gentleman and the Witch.</P>
<P>Now the Ceremony being over, he ask'd the Witch if the Bu&s;ine&s;s was done? She &s;aid <HI>yes.</HI> Well, but &s;ays he, have I &s;old my Soul to the
<PB N="330" REF="342">
<HI>Devil?</HI> Yes, &s;ays &s;he, you have, and you gave him Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, when you deliver'd the two Fire-&s;ticks to him. <HI>To him!</HI> &s;ays he, why, was that the <HI>Devil?</HI> Yes, &s;ays the old Hag. At which the young Man was in a terrible Fright for a while, but it went off again.</P>
<P>And what's next, &s;ays he, when &s;hall I &s;ee the the Lady for who&s;e &s;ake I have done all this? You &s;hall know that pre&s;ently, &s;aid &s;he, and open|ing the Door, in the next Room &s;he pre&s;ents him with a mo&s;t beautiful Lady, but had charg'd him not to &s;peak a Word to her: She was exact|dre&s;s'd like, and he pre&s;ently knew her to be the La|dy he de&s;ir'd; upon which he flew to her and cla&s;p|ed her in his Arms, but that Moment he had her fa&s;t, as he thought, in his Arms, &s;he vani&s;h'd out of his &s;ight.</P>
<P>Finding him&s;elf thus di&s;appointed, he upbraids the old Woman with betraying him, and flew out with ill Language at her, in a great Rage; the <HI>Devil</HI> often deluded him thus, after this, with Shews and Appearances, but &s;till no Perform|ance; after a while he gets an Opportunity to &s;peak with the Lady her &s;elf in Reality, but &s;he was as po&s;itive in her Denial as ever, and even took away all Hopes of his ever obtaining her, which put him into De&s;pair; for now he thought he had given him&s;elf up to the <HI>Devil</HI> for nothing, and this brought him to him&s;elf; &s;o that he made a penitent Confe&s;&s;ion of his Crime to &s;ome Friends, who took great Care of him, and encourag'd him, and at la&s;t furni&s;h'd him with &s;uch an An|&s;wer as put the <HI>Devil</HI> into a Fright, when he came for the Bargain.</P>
<P>For Satan, it &s;eems, <HI>as the Story &s;ays,</HI> had the Impudence to demand his Agreement, notwith|&s;tanding he had fail'd in the Performance on his Part; what the An&s;wer was I do not pretend to

have &s;een, but it &s;eems it was &s;omething like what is mention'd above, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that he was in better Hands, and that he dur&s;t not touch him.</P>
<P>I have heard of another Per&s;on that had actual|ly &s;ign'd a Contract with the <HI>Devil;</HI> and upon a Fa&s;t kept by &s;ome Prote&s;tant or Chri&s;tian Di|vines, while they were praying for the poor Man, the Devil was oblig'd to come and throw the Contract in at the Window.</P>
<P>But I vouch none of the&s;e Stories, there may be much in them and much U&s;e made of them, even whether exactly &s;uch in Fact, as they are related, or no; the be&s;t U&s;e I can make of them, is this, if any wicked de&s;perate Wretches have made Bargain and Sale with <HI>Satan,</HI> their only Way is to repent, if they know how, and that before he comes to claim them; then batter him with his own Guns; play Religion again&s;t Devili&s;m, and perhaps they may drive the <HI>Devil</HI> out of their Reach; at lea&s;t he will not come at them, which is as well.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, how many Stories have we handed about of the Devil's really coming with a terrible Appearance at the Time appoin|ted, and powerfully or by violence carrying away tho&s;e, that have given them&s;elves thus up to him; nay, and &s;ometimes a Piece of the Hou&s;e along with them, as in the famous In&s;tance of <HI>Sudbury, Anno.</HI> 1662. It &s;eems he comes with Rage and Fury upon &s;uch Occa&s;ions, pretending he only comes to take his own, or as if he had leave given him to come and take his Goods, <HI>as we &s;ay,</HI> where he could find them, and would &s;trike a Terror into all that &s;hould oppo&s;e him.</P>
<P>The greate&s;t Part of the Terror we are u&s;ually in upon this Occa&s;ion, is from a Suppo&s;ition, that when this <HI>Hell-Fire Contract</HI> is once made, God allows the <HI>Devil</HI> to come and take the wick|ed
<PB N="332" REF="344">
Creature, how and in what Manner he thinks fit, as being given up to him by his own Act and Deed; but in my Opinion there's no Divinity at all in that; for as, in our Law we puni&s;h a <HI>Felo de &s;e</HI> or Self-murtherer, becau&s;e, <HI>as the Law &s;ugge&s;ts,</HI> he had no Right to di&s;mi&s;s his own Life; that he being a Subject of the Common-wealth, the Government claims the <HI>Ward</HI> or Cu&s;tody of him, and &s;o 'twas not Murther only, but Robbery, and is a Felony again&s;t the State, robbing the King of his Liege-Man, as <HI>'tis ju&s;tly call'd;</HI> &s;o neither has any Man a Right to di&s;po&s;e of his Soul, which belongs to his Maker in Property and in Right of Creation: The Man then having no Right to &s;ell, Satan has no Right to buy, or at be&s;t he has made a Purcha&s;e without a Title, and con|&s;equently has no ju&s;t Claim to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>It is therefore a Mi&s;take to &s;ay, that when any of us have been &s;o mad to make &s;uch a pretend|ed Contract with the <HI>Devil,</HI> that God gives him leave to take it as his Due; <HI>'tis no &s;uch thing;</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> has bought, what you had no Right to &s;ell, and therefore, as an unlawful Oath is to be re|pented of, and then broken; &s;o your Bu&s;ine&s;s is to repent of the Crime, and then tell the <HI>Devil,</HI> you have better con&s;ider'd of it, and that you won't &s;tand to your Bargain, for you had no Power to &s;ell; and if he pretends to Violence after that, I am mi&s;taken; I believe the <HI>Devil</HI> knows better.</P>
<P>It is true, our old Mothers and Nur&s;es have told us other Things, but they only told us what their Mothers and Nur&s;es told them, and &s;o the Tale has been handed down from one Generation of old Women to another; but we have no Vou|chers for the Fact other than Oral Tradition, the Credit of which, I confe&s;s, goes but a very little Way with me; nor do I believe it one Jot
<PB N="333" REF="345">
the more for all the frightful Addenda which they generally join to the Tale, for it never wants a great Variety of that Kind.</P>
<P>Thus they tell us the Devil carried away Dr. <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> and took a Piece of the Wall of his Gar|den along with them: Thus at <HI>Salisbury</HI> the <HI>De|vil,</HI> at it is &s;aid, and publickly printed, carried away two Fellows that had given them&s;elves up to him, and carried away the Roof of the Hou&s;e with them, <HI>and the like;</HI> all which I believe my Share of; be&s;ides, if the&s;e Stories were really true, they are all again&s;t the Devil's true Intere&s;t, <HI>Satan</HI> mu&s;t be a Fool, which is indeed what I never took him to be in the Main; this would be the Way not to encrea&s;e the Number of De&s;pe|radoes, who &s;hould thus put them&s;elves into his Hand, but to make him&s;elf a Terror to them; and this is one of the mo&s;t powerful Objec|tions, I have again&s;t the Thing, for the <HI>Devil,</HI> I &s;ay, is no Fool, that mu&s;t be acknowleged; he knows his own Game, and generally plays it &s;ure.</P>
<P>I might, before I quit this Point, &s;eriou&s;ly re|flect here upon our <HI>Beau mond (viz.)</HI> the gay Part of Mankind, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of the Times we live in, who walk about in a Compo&s;ure and Tranquillity inexpre&s;&s;ible, and yet as we all know, mu&s;t certain|ly have all &s;old them&s;elves to the <HI>Devil,</HI> for the Power of acting the fooli&s;he&s;t Things with the greater Applau&s;e; it is true, to be a Fool is the mo&s;t plea&s;ant Life in the World, if the Fool has but the particular Felicity, which few Fools want, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to think them&s;elves wi&s;e: The learned &s;ay, it is the Dignity and Perfection of Fools, that they never fail tru&s;ting them&s;elves; they believe them&s;elves &s;ufficient and able for every Thing; and hence their want or wa&s;te of Brains is no Grievance to them, but they hug them&s;elves
<PB N="334" REF="346">
in the Satiety of their own Wit; but to bring other People to have the &s;ame Notion of them, which they have of them&s;elves, and to have their api&s;h and ridiculous Conduct make the &s;ame Impre&s;&s;ion on the Minds of others, as it does on their own; this requires a general Infatuation, and mu&s;t either be a Judgment from Heaven, or a Mi&s;t of Hell; nothing but the Devil can make all the Men of Brains applaud a Fool, and can any Man believe, that the Devil will do this for nothing? no, no, he will be well paid for it, and I know no other Way, they have to compound with him, but this of Bargain and Sale.</P>
<P>'Tis the &s;ame thing with Rakes and Bullies, as 'tis with Fools and Beaus; and this brings me to the Subject of <HI>buying</HI> and <HI>&s;elling</HI> it &s;elf, and to examine what is under&s;tood by it in the World, what People mean by &s;uch and &s;uch a Man &s;elling him&s;elf to the Devil: I know the common Ac|ceptation of it is, that they make &s;ome Capitula|tion for &s;ome Indulgence in Wickedne&s;s, on Con|ditions of Safety and Impunity, which the De|vil promi&s;es them; tho', as I &s;aid above, he is a <HI>Bite</HI> in that too, for he can't perform the Con|ditions; however, I &s;ay, he promi&s;es boldly, and they believe him, and for this Privilege in Wick|edne&s;s, they con&s;ent, that he &s;hall come and fetch them for his own, at &s;uch or &s;uch a Time.</P>
<P>This is the State of the Ca&s;e in the general Acceptation of it; I do not &s;ay 'tis really &s;o, nay 'tis even an Incon&s;i&s;tency in it &s;elf; for one would think, they need not Capitulate with the Devil to be &s;o, and &s;o, &s;uperlatively wicked, and give him &s;uch a Price for it, &s;eeing, unle&s;s we have a wrong Notion of him, he is naturally enclin'd, as well as avow'dly, willing to have all Men be as &s;uperlative|ly wicked as po&s;&s;ibly they can, and mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be always ready to i&s;&s;ue out his Licen&s;es gratis, as
<PB N="335" REF="347">
far as his Authority will go in the Ca&s;e; and there|fore I do not &s;ee why the Wretches that deal with him, &s;hould article with him for a Price; but &s;uppo&s;e, for Argument &s;ake, that it is &s;o, then the next Thing is, &s;ome capital Crime follows the Contract, and then the Wretch is for&s;aken, for the <HI>Devil</HI> cannot protect him, as he promi|&s;ed; &s;o he is <HI>Tru&s;t up,</HI> and like <HI>Coleman</HI> at the Gallows, he exclaims that <HI>there is no Truth in</HI> Devils.</P>
<P>It may be true, however, that under the power|ful Guard and Protection of the <HI>Devil,</HI> Men do &s;ometimes go a great Way in Crime, and that per|haps farther in the&s;e our Days of boa&s;ted Morals than was known among our Fathers; the on|ly Difference that I meet with between the Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> in former Days, and tho&s;e of our Ages, &s;eems to be in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Management, not in theirs; the Sum of which amounts to this, that Satan &s;eems to act with more Cunning, and they with le&s;s; for in the former Ages of Satan's Dominion, he had much Bu&s;ine&s;s upon his Hands, all his Art and Engines, and Engineers al&s;o, were kept fully employ'd, to wheedle, allure, betray and circumvent People, and draw them into Crimes, and they found him, as we may &s;ay, a full Employment; I doubt not, he was call'd the Tempter on that very Account; but the Ca&s;e &s;eems quite alter'd now, the Tables are turned; then the Devil tempted Men to &s;in, <HI>But now, in &s;hort,</HI> they tempt the Devil; Men pu&s;h into Crimes before he pu&s;hes them; they out &s;hoot him in his own Bow, out run him on his own Ground, and, as we &s;ay of &s;ome hot Spurs who ride Po&s;t, they whip the Po&s;t-Boy; in a Word, the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;eems to have no Bu&s;ine&s;s now but to &s;it &s;till and look on.</P>
<P><PB N="336" REF="348">
This, I mu&s;t confe&s;s, &s;eems to intimate &s;ome &s;ecret Compact between the Devil and them; but then it looks, not as if they had contracted with the <HI>Devil</HI> for leave to &s;in, but that the <HI>Devil</HI> had contracted with them, that they &s;hould &s;in &s;o and &s;o, up to &s;uch a Degree, and that without giving him the Trouble of daily Solicitation, private Management, and artful &s;crewing up their Pa&s;|&s;ions, their Affections and their mo&s;t retir'd Fa|culties, as he was before oblig'd to do.</P>
<P>This al&s;o appears more agreeable to the Na|ture of the thing; and as it is a mo&s;t exqui&s;ite part of Satan's Cunning, &s;o 'tis an undoubted Te&s;timony of his Succe&s;s; if it was not &s;o, he could never bring his Kingdom to &s;uch a height of ab&s;olute Power as he has done; this al&s;o &s;olves &s;everal difficulties in the Affair of the World's pre&s;ent Way of &s;inning, which otherwi&s;e it would be very hard to under&s;tand; as particularly how &s;ome eminent Men of Quality among us, who&s;e upper Rooms are not extraordinary well furni&s;h|ed in other Ca&s;es, yet are &s;o very witty in their Wickedne&s;s, that they gather Admirers by hun|dreds and thou&s;ands; who, however heavy, lum|pi&s;h, &s;low and backward, even by Nature, and in force of Con&s;titution in better things, yet in their Race <HI>Devil-wards</HI> they are of a &s;uddain grown nimble, light of Foot, and outrun all their Neighbours; Fellows that are as Empty of Sen&s;e as Beggars are of Hone&s;ty, and as far from Brains as a Whore is of Mode&s;ty; on a &s;ud|dain you &s;hall find them dip into <HI>Polemicks,</HI> &s;tudy <HI>Michael Servetus, Socinus,</HI> and the mo&s;t learned of their Di&s;ciples; they &s;hall rea&s;on again&s;t all Religion, as &s;trongly as a Philo&s;opher; bla&s;pheme with &s;uch a Keenne&s;s of Wit, and &s;atyri&s;e God and Eternity, with &s;uch a Brightne&s;s of Fancy, as if the Soul of a <HI>Roche&s;ter</HI> or a <HI>Hobbs</HI> was tran&s;|migrated
<PB N="337" REF="349">
into them; in a little length of Time more they banter Heaven, burle&s;que the Trinity, and je&s;t with every &s;acred thing, and all &s;o &s;harp, &s;o ready, and &s;o terribly witty, as if they were born Buftoons, and were &s;ingl'd out by Nature to be Champions for the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Whence can all this come? how is the Change wrought? who but the Devil can inject Wit in Spight of natural Dullne&s;s, create Brains, fill emp|ty Heads, and &s;upply the Vacuities in the Un|der&s;tanding? and will Satan do all this for no|thing? <HI>No, no,</HI> he is too wi&s;e for that; I can never doubt a &s;ecret Compact, if there is &s;uch a thing in Nature; when I &s;ee a Head where there was no Head, Sen&s;e in <HI>Po&s;&s;e</HI> where there is no Sen&s;e in <HI>E&s;&s;e,</HI> Wit without Brains, and Sight without Eyes, 'tis all <HI>Devil-Work:</HI> Could <HI>G&mdash;</HI>write Satyrs, that could neither read <HI>Latin</HI> or &s;pell <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> like old Sir <HI>William Read,</HI> who wrote a Book of Opticks, which when it was printed, he did not know which was the right Side upper|mo&s;t, and which the wrong? Could this eminent uninform'd Beau turn Athei&s;t, and make wi&s;e Speeches again&s;t that Being, which made him a Fool, if the Devil had not &s;old him &s;ome Wit in exchange for that Trifle of his, call'd Soul? Had he not barter'd his In&s;ide with that Son of the Morning, to have his Tongue tip'd with Bla&s;phe|my, he that knew nothing of a God, but only to &s;wear by him, could never have &s;et up for a Wit, to burle&s;que his Providence and ridicule his Government of the World.</P>
<P>But the Devil, as he is God of the World, has one particular Advantage, and that is, that when he has Work to do he very &s;eldom wants In&s;truments; with this Circum&s;tance al&s;o, that the Degene|racy of human Nature &s;upplies him; as the late King of <HI>France,</HI> &s;aid of him&s;elf, when they
<PB N="338" REF="350">
told him what a Calamity was like to befall his Kingdom by the Famine: <HI>Well,</HI> &s;ays the King, then I &s;hall not want Soldiers; <HI>and it was &s;o,</HI> want of Bread &s;upplied his Army with Recruits; &s;o want of Grace &s;upplies the <HI>Devil</HI> with Repro|bates for his Work.</P>
<P>Another Rea&s;on why, I think, the <HI>Devil</HI> has made more Bargains of that Kind we &s;peak of, in this Age, is, becau&s;e he &s;eems to have lay'd by his Cloven-Foot; all his old Emi&s;&s;aries, the Tools of his Trade, the Engineers which he employ'd in his Mines, &s;uch as Witches, Warlocks, Magi|cians, Conjurers, A&s;trologers, and all the helli&s;h Train or Rabble of human <HI>Devil,</HI> who did his Drudgery in former Days, &s;eem to be out of Work: I &s;hall give you a fuller Enumeration of them in the next Chapter.</P>
<P>The&s;e, I &s;ay, &s;eem to be laid a&s;ide; not that his Work is abated, or that his Bu&s;ine&s;s with Mankind, for their Delu&s;ion and De&s;truction is not the &s;ame, or perhaps more than ever; but the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;eems to have chang'd Hands; the Tem|per and Genius of Mankind is alter'd, and they are not to be taken by Fright and Horror, as they were then: The Figures of tho&s;e Creatures was always di&s;mal and horrible, and that is it which I mean by the <HI>Cloven-Foot;</HI> but now Wit, Beauty and gay Things, are the Sum of his Craft, he manages by the Soft and the Smooth, the Fair and the Artful, the Kind and the Cunning, not by the Frightful and Terrible, the Ugly and the Odious.</P>
<LG>
<L>When the <HI>Devil</HI> for weighty Di&s;patches,</L>
<L>Wanted Me&s;&s;engers cunning and bold,</L>
<L>He pa&s;s'd by the Beautiful Faces,</L>

<HEAD>CHAP. IX. <HI>Of the Tools the</HI> Devil <HI>works with,</HI> (viz.) <HI>Witches, Wizards or Warlocks, Conjurers, Magicians, Divines, A&s;trologers, Inter|preters of Dreams, Tellers of Fortunes; and above all the re&s;t, his particular mo|dern Privy-Coun&s;ellors call'd Wits and Fools.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THO', as I have advanc'd in the foregoing Chapter, the <HI>Devil</HI> his very much chang'd Hands in his modern Management of the World,
<PB N="340" REF="352">
and that in&s;tead of the Rabble and long Train of Implements reckon'd up above, he now walks about in Beaus, Beauties, Wits and Fools; yet I mu&s;t not omit to tell you that he has not Di&s;|mi&s;s'd his former Regiments, but like Officers in Time of Peace, he keeps them all in half Pay, or like Extraordinary Men at the Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e, they are kept at a Call, to be ready to fill up Vacancies, or to employ when he is more than ordinarily full of Bu&s;ine&s;s; and therefore it may not be ami&s;s to give &s;ome brief Account of them, from Satan's own Memoirs, their Performance being no incon&s;iderable Part of his Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Nor will it be an unprofitable Digre&s;&s;ion to go back a little to the primitive In&s;titution of all the&s;e <HI>Orders,</HI> for they are very antient, and I a&s;&s;ure you, it requires great Knowledge of An|tiquity, to give a Particular of their Original; I &s;hall be very brief in it.</P>
<P>In order then to this Enquiry, you mu&s;t know that it was not for want of Servants, that Satan took this Sort of People into his Pay; he had, as I have ob&s;erv'd in its Place, Millions of dili|gent <HI>Devils</HI> at his Call, whatever Bu&s;ine&s;s, and however difficult, he had for them to do; but as I have &s;aid above, that our modern People are forwarder than even the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf can de&s;ire them to be; and that they come before they are call'd, run before they are &s;ent, and crowd them|&s;elves into his Service; &s;o it &s;eems it was in tho&s;e early Days, when the World was one uni|ver&s;al Monarchy under his Dominion, as I have at large de&s;crib'd in its Place.</P>
<P>In tho&s;e Days the Wickedne&s;s of the World keeping a ju&s;t Pace with their Ignorance, this in|ferior Sort of low priz'd In&s;truments, did the <HI>Devil</HI>'s work mighty well; they drudg'd on in his Black-Art, &s;o laboriou&s;ly, and with &s;uch
<PB N="341" REF="353">
good Succe&s;s, that he found it was better to em|ploy them as Tools to delude and draw in Man|kind, than to &s;end his invi&s;ible Implements a|bout, and oblige them to take &s;uch Shapes and Dre&s;&s;es as were nece&s;&s;ary upon every trifling Oc|ca&s;ion; which, perhaps, was more Co&s;t than Wor|&s;hip, more Pains than Pay.</P>
<P>Having then a Set of the&s;e Voluntiers in his Ser|vice, the true <HI>Devil</HI> had nothing to do but to keep an exact Corre&s;pondence with them, and communicate &s;ome needful Powers to them, to make them be and do &s;omething extraordinary, and give them a Reputation in their Bu&s;ine&s;s; and the&s;e, in a Word, did a great Part of, nay almo&s;t all the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World.</P>
<P>To this Purpo&s;e gave he them Power, if we may believe old <HI>Glanville, Baxter, Hicks,</HI> and other learn'd Con&s;ultors of Oracles, to walk invi&s;ible, to fly in the Air, ride upon Broom-&s;ticks, and other Wooden Gear, to interpret Dreams, an|&s;wer Que&s;tions, betray Secrets, to talk (Gibbe|ri&s;h) the univer&s;al Language, to rai&s;e Storms, &s;ell Winds, bring up Spirits, di&s;turb the Dead, and torment the Living, with a thou&s;and other need|ful Tricks to amu&s;e the World, keep them&s;elves in Veneration, and carry on the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Empire in the World.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Nations among whom the&s;e infernal Practices were found, were the <HI>Chaldeans;</HI> and that I may do Ju&s;tice in earne&s;t, as well as in je&s;t, it mu&s;t be allow'd that the <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> or tho&s;e of them &s;o call'd, were not Conjurers or Magicians, only Philo&s;ophers and Studiers of Nature, wi&s;e, &s;ober and &s;tudious Men at fir&s;t, and we have an extraordinary Account of them; and if we may believe &s;ome of our be&s;t Writers of Fame, <HI>Abraham</HI> was him&s;elf famous among them for &s;uch Magic, as Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI>
<PB N="342" REF="354">
expre&s;&s;es it, <HI>Qui Contemplatione Creaturarum Cog|novit Creatorem.</HI></P>
<P>Now granting this, it is all to my Purpo&s;e, name|ly, that the <HI>Devil</HI> drew the&s;e wi&s;e Men in, to &s;earch after more Knowledge than Nature could in&s;truct them in; and the Knowledge of the true God being at that Time &s;unk very low, he de|bauch'd them all with Dreams, Apparitions, Con|jurers, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> till he ruin'd the ju&s;t Notions they had, and made <HI>Devils</HI> of them all, like him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The learned <HI>Senen&s;is,</HI> &s;peaking of this <HI>Chaldean</HI> Kind of Learning, gives us an Account of five Sorts of them; you will pardon me for being &s;o grave as to go this Length back.</P>
<P N="1">1. <HI>Cha&s;cedin</HI> or <HI>Chaldeans,</HI> properly &s;o call'd, being A&s;tronomers.</P>
<P N="2">2. <HI>A&s;aphim</HI> or <HI>Magicians,</HI> &s;uch was <HI>Zoroa&s;tres</HI> and <HI>Balaam</HI> the Son of <HI>Beor.</HI></P>
<P N="3">3. <HI>Chatumim</HI> or Interpreters of Dreams and hard Speeches, Inchanters, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P N="4">4. <HI>Meca&s;phim</HI> or Witches, call'd at fir&s;t Pro|phets, afterwards Malefici or Venefici, Poi|&s;oners.</P>
<P N="5">5. <HI>Gazarim</HI> or Auru&s;pices, and Diviners, &s;uch as divin'd by the Entrails of Bea&s;ts, the Li|ver in particular; mention'd in <HI>Ezek.</HI> or as others, call'd Augurs.</P>
<P>Now, as to all the&s;e, I &s;uppo&s;e, I may do them no wrong, if I &s;ay, however ju&s;tifiable they were in the Beginning, the <HI>Devil</HI> got them all into his Service at la&s;t, and that brings me to my my Text again, from which the re&s;t was a Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P N="1">1. The <HI>Cha&s;cedin</HI> or <HI>Chaldean</HI> A&s;tronomers turn|ed A&s;trologers, Fortune-Tellers, Calculators

of Nativities, and vile Deluders of the Peo|ple, as if the Wi&s;dom of the holy God was in them, as <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> &s;aid of <HI>Daniel</HI> on that very Account.</P>

<P>The <HI>Arabians</HI> follow'd the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> in this Study, while it was kept within its due Bounds, and after them the <HI>Egyptians;</HI> and among the Latter we find that <HI>Jannes</HI> and <HI>Jambres</HI> were famous for their leading <HI>Pharoah</HI> by their pre|tended Magic Performances, to reject the real Miracles of <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> and Hi&s;tory tells us of &s;trange Pranks the Wi&s;e-Men, the Magicians and the South&s;ayers plaid to delude the People in the mo&s;t early Ages of the World.</P>
<P>But, as I &s;ay, now, the <HI>Devil</HI> has improv'd him&s;elf, &s;o he did then; for the <HI>Graecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Heathen Rites coming on, they outdid all the Magicians and South&s;ayers, by e&s;tabli&s;h|ing the <HI>Devil</HI>'s lying Oracles, which, as a Ma&s;|ter-Piece of Hell, did the <HI>Devil</HI> more Honour, and brought more Homage to him, than ever he had before, or could arrive to &s;ince.</P>

<P>Some &s;ay the evil Eye and the wicked Look were Parts of the Enchantment, and that the Witches, when they were in the height of their Bu&s;ine&s;s, had a powerful Influence with both; that by looking upon any Per&s;on they could be|witch them, and make the <HI>Devil, as the</HI> Scots <HI>expre&s;s it,</HI> ride through them booted and &s;purr'd; and that hence came that very &s;ignificant Saying, <HI>to look like a Witch.</HI></P>

<P>The&s;e Witches, 'tis &s;aid, are furni&s;h'd with Power &s;uitable to the Occa&s;ion that is before them, and particularly that which de&s;erves to be con&s;i|der'd, as Prediction, and foretelling Events, which I in&s;i&s;t the Author of Witchcraft is not accom|pli&s;h'd with him&s;elf, nor can he communicate it to any other: How then <HI>Witches</HI> come to be able to foretell Things to come, which, 'tis &s;aid, the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf cannot know, and which, as I have &s;hewn, 'tis evident he does not know him&s;elf, is yet to be determin'd; that Witches do foretell, is certain, from the Witch of <HI>Endor,</HI> who foretold Things to <HI>Saul,</HI> which he knew not before, namely, that he &s;hould be &s;lain in Battle the next Day, which accordingly came to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>There are, however, and notwith&s;tanding this particular Ca&s;e, many In&s;tances wherein the <HI>De|vil</HI> has not been able to foretell approaching Events, and that in Things of the utmo&s;t Con&s;equence, and he has given certain fooli&s;h or fal&s;e An&s;wers in &s;uch Ca&s;es; the DEVIL's Prie&s;ts, which were

&s;ummon'd in by the Prophet <HI>Elija,</HI> to decide the Di&s;pute between God and <HI>Baal,</HI> had the <HI>Devil</HI> been able to have inform'd them of it, would certainly have receiv'd Notice from him, of what was intended again&s;t them by <HI>Elija;</HI> that is to &s;ay, that they would be all cut in Pieces; for Satan was not &s;uch a Fool as not to know that <HI>Baal</HI> was a Non Entity, a Nothing, at be&s;t a dead Man, peri&s;h'd and rotting in his Grave; for <HI>Baal</HI> was <HI>Bell</HI> or <HI>Belus,</HI> an antient King of the <HI>A&s;&s;yri|an</HI> Monarchy, and he could no more an&s;wer by Fire to con&s;ume the Sacrifice, than he could rai&s;e him&s;elf from the dead.</P>
<P>But the Prie&s;ts of <HI>Baal</HI> were left of their Ma&s;ter to their ju&s;t Fate, namely, to be a Sa|crifice to the Fury of a deluded People; Hence I infer his Inability, for it would have been very unkind and ungrateful in him not to have an&s;wer'd them, if he had been able. There is another Argument rai&s;ed here mo&s;t ju&s;tily again&s;t the <HI>De|vil,</HI> with Relation to his being under Re&s;traint, and that of greater Eminence than we imagine, and it is drawn from this very Pa&s;&s;age, thus; 'tis not to be doubted but that <HI>Satan,</HI> who has much of the Element put into his Hands, as Prince of the Air, had a Power, or was able po|tentially &s;peaking, to have an&s;wer'd <HI>Baal</HI>'s Prie&s;ts by Fire; Fire being in Vertue of his airy Prin|cipality a Part of his Dominion; but he was certainly <HI>withheld</HI> by the Superior Hand, which gave him that Dominion, I mean <HI>withheld</HI> for the Occa&s;ion only: So in another Ca&s;e, it was plain that <HI>Baalam,</HI> who was one of tho&s;e Sorts of <HI>Chaldeans</HI> mention'd above, who dealt in <HI>Divi|nations</HI> and <HI>Inchantments,</HI> was withheld from cur&s;|ing <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>

There is another Piece of dark Practice here, which lies between Satan and his particular Agents, and which they may give us an An&s;wer to, when they can, which I think will not be in ha&s;te; and that is about the ob&s;equious <HI>Devil</HI> &s;ubmitting to be call'd up into Vi&s;ibility, whenever an old Woman has her Hand cro&s;s'd with a white Six-pence, <HI>as they Call it:</HI> One would think that in&s;tead of the&s;e vile Things call'd Witches, being &s;old to the <HI>Devil,</HI> the <HI>De|vil</HI> was really &s;old for a Slave to them; for how far &s;oever Satan's Re&s;idence is off of this State of Life, they have Power, it &s;eems, to fetch him from home, and oblige him to come at their Call.</P>
<P>I can give little Account of this, only that indeed &s;o it is; nor is the Thing &s;o &s;trange in its &s;elf, as the Methods to do it are mean, fooli&s;h, and ridiculous; as making a Circle and dancing in it, pronouncing &s;uch and &s;uch Words, &s;aying the Lord's Prayer backward, and the like; now is this agreeable to the Dignity of the Prince of the Air or Atmo&s;phere, that he &s;hould be command|ed forth with no more Pomp or Ceremony than that of muttering a few Words, &s;uch as the old Witches and he agree about? or is there &s;ome|thing el&s;e in it, which none of us or them&s;elves under&s;tand?</P>
<P>Perhaps, indeed, he is always with tho&s;e Peo|ple call'd Witches and Conjurers, or at lea&s;t &s;ome of his <HI>Camp Volant</HI> are always pre&s;ent, and &s;o upon the lea&s;t call of the Wizard, it is but putting off the mi&s;ty Cloak and &s;howing them|&s;elves.</P>

<P>But to come to the Bu&s;ine&s;s, without Cir|cumlocutions; I am to enquire how Satan i&s;&s;ues out his Orders, gives his In&s;tructions and fully delivers his Mind to his Emi&s;&s;aries, of whom I have mention'd &s;ome in the Title to Chap. IX. In order to this, you mu&s;t form an Idea of the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;itting in great State, in open Campaign, with all his Legions about him, in the height of the Atmo&s;phere; or if you will, at a certain Di&s;|tance from the Atmo&s;phere, and above it, that the Plan of his Encampment might not be hur|ried round its own Axis, with the Earth's diurnal Motion, which might be &s;ome Di&s;turbance to him.</P>
<P>By this fix'd Situation, the Earth performing its Rotation, he has every Part and Parc$l of $ brought to a direct Oppo&s;ition to him, and con|&s;equently to his View once in twenty four Hours: The la&s;t time I was there, if I remember right, he had this Quarter of the World, which we call Chri&s;tendom, ju&s;t under his Eye: and as the Motion is not &s;o &s;wift, but that his piercing Opticks can take a &s;trict View of it <HI>on pa&s;&s;ant;</HI> for the Circumference of it being but twenty one thou&s;and Miles, and its circular Motion being full twenty four Hours performing, he has &s;ome|thing more than an Hour to view every thou|&s;and Miles, which, to his &s;upernatural Penetration, is not worth naming.</P>
<P>As he takes thus a daily View of all the Cir|cle, and an hourly View of the Parts, he is fully Ma&s;ter of all Tran&s;actions, at lea&s;t &s;uch as are done above Board by all Mankind; and then he di&s;patches his Emi&s;&s;aries or <HI>Aid du Camps</HI> to every Part with his Orders and In&s;tructions: Now the&s;e Emi&s;&s;aries, you are to under&s;tand, are not the

<P>The&s;e are tho&s;e, who they tell us our Witches, Sorcerers, Wizards, and &s;uch Sorts of Folks con|ver&s;e freely with, and are therefore call'd their <HI>Familiars;</HI> and as they tell us, come to them in human Shapes, talk to them with articulate plain Voices, as if Men, and that yet the &s;aid Witches, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> know them to be <HI>Devils.</HI></P>
<P>Hi&s;tory has not yet enlighten'd us in this Part of u&s;eful Knowledge, or at lea&s;t not &s;ufficiently for a De&s;cription of the Per&s;ons or Habits of the&s;e Sorts of Appearances; as what Shapes they take up, what Language they &s;peak, and what particular Works they perform, &s;o we mu&s;t re|fer it to farther Enquiry; but if we may cre|dit Hi&s;tory, we are told many famous Stories of the&s;e Appearances; for Example, the famous Mother <HI>Lakland,</HI> who was burnt for a Witch
<PB N="356" REF="368">
at <HI>Ip&s;wich, Anno.</HI> 1645, confe&s;&s;ed at the Time of her Execution, or a little before it, that &s;he had frequent Conver&s;ation with the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf; that &s;he being very poor, and withall of a devi|li&s;h pa&s;&s;ionate, cruel and revengeful Di&s;po&s;ition be|fore, u&s;ed to wi&s;h &s;he had it in her Power to do &s;uch and &s;uch mi&s;chievous Things to &s;ome that &s;he hated, and that the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, who, it &s;eems, knew her Temper, came to her one Night as &s;he lay in her Bed, and was between &s;leeping and waking, and &s;peaking in a deep hollow Voice, told her; if &s;he would &s;erve him in &s;ome Things he would employ her to do, &s;he &s;hould have her Will of all her Enemies, and &s;hould want for nothing: That &s;he was much afraid at fir&s;t, but that he &s;olliciting her very often, bad her not be afraid of him, and &s;till urg'd her to yield, and as &s;he &s;ays, &s;truck his Claw into her Hand, and tho' it did not hurt her, made it bleed, and with the Blood wrote the Covenants, that is to &s;ay, the Bargain between them: being ask'd what was in them, and whether he requir'd her to cur&s;e or deny God or Chri&s;t? She &s;aid no.</P>
<P>N. B. I do not find &s;he told them whether the <HI>Devil</HI> wrote it with a Pen, or whether on Paper or Parchment, nor whether &s;he &s;ign'd it or no, but it &s;eems he carry'd it a|way with him. I &s;uppo&s;e, if Satan's Re|gi&s;ter were examin'd, it might be found among the Archives of Hell, the Rolls of his <HI>acta Publica;</HI> and when his Hi&s;toriogra|pher Royal publi&s;hes them, we may look for it among them.</P>
<P>Then he furni&s;h'd her with three <HI>Devils,</HI> to wait upon her (I &s;uppo&s;e) for &s;he confe&s;s'd they were to be employ'd in her Service; they attended in the Shapes of two little Dogs and a Mole: The
<PB N="357" REF="369">
fir&s;t &s;he bewitch'd was her own Husband, by which he lay a while in great Mi&s;ery and died; then &s;he &s;ent to one Captain <HI>Beal</HI> and burn'd a new Ship of his ju&s;t built, which had never been at Sea; the&s;e and many other horrid Things &s;he did and confe&s;s'd, and having been twenty Years a Witch, at la&s;t the <HI>Devil</HI> left her, and &s;he was burnt as &s;he de&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>That &s;ome extraordinary Occa&s;ions may bring the&s;e Agents of the <HI>Devil,</HI> nay, &s;ometimes the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf, to a&s;&s;ume human Shapes, and ap|pear to other People we cannot doubt; he did thus in the Ca&s;e of our Saviour <HI>as a Tempter,</HI> and &s;ome think he did &s;o to <HI>Mana&s;&s;es</HI> as a Familiar, who the Scripture charges with Sorcery and having a Familiar or Devil; Fame tells us that St. <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI> frequently conver&s;t with him, and finally, took him by the No&s;e; and &s;o of others.</P>
<P>But in the&s;e modern Ages of the World, he finds it much more to his Purpo&s;e to work under Ground as I have ob&s;erv'd, and to keep upon the Re&s;erve; &s;o that we have no authentick Account of his per&s;onal Appearance, but what are very antient or very remote from our Faith, as well as our Enquiry.</P>
<P>It &s;eems to be a Que&s;tion that would bear &s;ome debating, whether all Apparitions are not <HI>Devils</HI> or from the <HI>Devil?</HI> but there being &s;o many of tho&s;e Apparitions which we call Spirits, which really a&s;&s;ume Shapes and make Appearances in the World, upon &s;uch Accounts as we know <HI>Satan</HI> him&s;elf &s;corns to be employ'd in, that I mu&s;t di&s;mi&s;s the Que&s;tion in favour of the <HI>Devil;</HI> a&s;&s;uring them, that as he never willingly did any good in his Life, &s;o he would be far from giving him&s;elf the Trouble of &s;etting one Foot into the World, on &s;uch an Errand; and for that Rea&s;on we may be a&s;&s;ur'd tho&s;e certain Apparitions, which
<PB N="358" REF="370">
we are told came to detect a Murther in <HI>Glouce&s;ter|&s;hire,</HI> and others who appear'd to prevent the ruin|ing an Orphan for want of finding a Deed, that was not lo&s;t, was certainly &s;ome other Power equal|ly concern'd, and not the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>On the other Hand, neither will it follow that <HI>Satan</HI> never appears in human Shape; for tho' every Apparition may not be the <HI>Devil,</HI> yet it does not follow that the <HI>Devil</HI> never makes an Apparition: all I &s;hall &s;ay to it is, as I have men|tion'd before, that generally &s;peaking, the <HI>Devil</HI> finds it more for his Purpo&s;e, to have his Intere&s;t in the World propagated another Way; namely, in private, and his per&s;onal Appearances are re|&s;erv'd for Things only of extraordinary Con&s;e|quence, and, as I may &s;ay, of evident Nece&s;&s;ity, where his Honour is concern'd, and where his Inte|re&s;t could be carried on no other Way; not for|getting to take Notice that this is very &s;eldom.</P>
<P>It remains to enquire, what then tho&s;e Things are which we make &s;o much &s;tir about, and which are call'd <HI>Apparitions,</HI> or Spirits a&s;&s;um|ing human Shapes, and &s;hewing them&s;elves to People on particular Occa&s;ions? whether they are evil Spirits or Good? and tho', indeed, this is out of my Way at this Time, and does not relate at all to the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, yet I thought it not ami&s;s to mention it; (1.) Becau&s;e, as I have &s;aid, I do not wholly exclude Satan from all Concern in &s;uch Things; and (2.) Becau&s;e I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s the Que&s;tion with &s;o very &s;hort an An&s;wer, namely, that we may determine which are and which are not the <HI>Devil</HI>'s, by the Errand they come upon; every one to his own Bu&s;ine&s;s; if it comes of a good Errand, you may certainly acquit the <HI>Devil</HI> of it, conclude him innocent, and that he has no hand in it; If it comes of a wicked and devili&s;h Errand, you may e'en take him up upon
<PB N="359" REF="371">
Su&s;picion, 'tis ten to one but you find him at the Bottom of it.</P>
<P>Next to Apparitions, we find Mankind di&s;turb'd by abundance of little odd re&s;erv'd Ways which the <HI>Devil</HI> is &s;hrewdly &s;u&s;pected of having a Hand in, &s;uch as <HI>Dreams, Noi&s;es, Voices,</HI> &amp;c. &s;mells of Brim&s;tone, Candles burning Blew, and the like.</P>
<P>As to Dreams, I have nothing to &s;ay in Satan's Prejudice at all there; I make no Que&s;tion but he deals very much in that Kind of Intelligence, and why &s;hould he not? we know <HI>Heaven</HI> it &s;elf formerly conver&s;t very often with the greate&s;t of Men, by the &s;ame Method, and the <HI>Devil</HI> is known to mimick the Methods, as well as the Actions of his Maker; whether Heaven has not quite left off that Way of working, we are not certain; but we pretty well know the <HI>Devil</HI> has not left it, and I believe &s;ome In&s;tances may be given where his Wor&s;hip has been really &s;een and talk'd to in &s;leep, as much as if the Per&s;on had been awake with his Eyes open.</P>
<P>The&s;e are to be di&s;tingui&s;h'd too, pretty much by the Goodne&s;s or Badne&s;s of the Subject; how often have Men committed Murther, Robbery and Adultery in a Dream, and at the &s;ame time except an extraordinary Agitation of the Soul, and expre&s;s'd by extraordinary Noi&s;es in the Sleep, by violent Sweating and other &s;uch Ways, the Head has never been remov'd from the Pillow, or the Body &s;o much as turn'd in the Bed?</P>
<P>Whether in &s;uch Ca&s;es, the Soul with all the Pa&s;&s;ions and Affections being agitated, and giving their full a&s;&s;ent to the Facts, of whatever Kind &s;oever, the Man is not as Guilty as if the Sins &s;o dream'd of his committing, had been actually committed? tho' it be no Doubt to me, but that it is &s;o, yet as it is foreign to the pre&s;ent Affair, and not at all relating to the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Hi&s;tory, I
<PB N="360" REF="372">
leave it to the Reverend Doctors of the Church, as properly belonging to them to decide.</P>
<P>I knew a Per&s;on who the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;o haunted with naked Women, fine beautiful Ladies in Bed with him, and Ladies of his Acquaintance too, offering their Favours to him, and all in his Sleep; &s;o that he &s;eldom &s;lept without &s;ome &s;uch Entertainment; the Particulars are too gro&s;s for my Story, but he gave me &s;everal long Accounts of his Night's <HI>Amours,</HI> and being a Man of a vertuous Life and good Morals, it was the great|e&s;t Surprize to him imaginable; for you cannot doubt but that the cunning <HI>Devil</HI> made every thing be acted to the Life with him, and in a Manner the mo&s;t wicked; he own'd with Grief to me, that the very fir&s;t Attack the <HI>Devil</HI> made upon him, was with a very beautiful Lady of his Acquain|tance, who he had been really &s;omething freer than ordinary with in their common Conver&s;ation; This Lady he brought to him in a Po&s;ture for Wickedne&s;s, and wrought up his Inclination &s;o high in his Sleep, that he, as he thought, actually went about to debauch her, &s;he not at all re&s;i&s;ting; but that he wak'd in the very Moment, to his particular Satisfaction.</P>
<P>He was greatly concern'd at this Part, namely, that he really gave the Con&s;ent of his Will to the Fact, and wanted to know if he was not as Guilty of Adultery, as if he had lain with her; indeed he decided the Que&s;tion again&s;t him&s;elf, &s;o forcibly, that I, who was of the &s;ame Opinion before, had nothing to &s;ay again&s;t it; however, I con|firm'd him in it, by asking him the&s;e Que&s;tions.</P>
<P N="1">1. Whether he did not think the <HI>Devil</HI> had the chief Hand in &s;uch a Dream? he an|&s;wer'd, it could certainly be no body el&s;e, it mu&s;t be the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P N="2"><PB N="361" REF="373">
2. I then ask'd him what Rea&s;on the <HI>Devil</HI> could have for it, if his Con&s;ent to the Fact in Sleep had not been criminal? <HI>That's true indeed,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>I am an&s;wer'd:</HI> But then he ask'd another Que&s;tion, which, I confe&s;s is not &s;o ea&s;y to an|&s;wer, namely, How he &s;hould prevent being &s;erv'd &s;o again.</P>
<P>Nor could all my Divinity or his own keep the <HI>Devil</HI> from attacking him again; on the other Hand, as I have &s;aid, he worried him to that De|gree, that he injur'd his Health, bringing naked Women to him, &s;ometimes one, &s;ometimes ano|ther, &s;ometimes in one Po&s;ture of Lewdne&s;s, &s;ome|times in another, &s;ometimes into his very Arms, &s;ometimes with &s;uch Additions as I am not mer|ry enough, and &s;ometimes &s;uch as I am not wick|ed enough to put into your Heads; the Man, indeed, could not help it, and &s;o the <HI>Devil</HI> was more Faulty than he; but as I hinted to him, he might bring his Mind to &s;uch a &s;tated Habit of Virtue, as to prevent its a&s;&s;enting to any wick|ed Motion, even in Sleep, and that would be the Way to put an End to the Attempt; and this Advice he reli&s;h'd very well, and practi&s;ed, I be|lieve, with Succe&s;s.</P>
<P>By this &s;ame Method, the &s;ame <HI>Devil</HI> Injects powerful Incentives to other Crimes, provokes Avarice, by laying a great Quantity of Gold in your View, and no body pre&s;ent, giving you an Opportunity to &s;teal it, or &s;ome of it, at the &s;ame time, perhaps, knowing your Circum&s;tances to be &s;uch as that you are at that Time in a great want of the Money.</P>
<P>I knew another, who being a Trade&s;man, and in great Di&s;tre&s;s for Money in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, dream'd that he was walking all alone in a great Wood, and that he met a little Child with a Bag of Gold in its Hand, and a fine Necklace of
<PB N="362" REF="374">
Diamonds on its Neck, upon the Sight, his Wants pre&s;ently dictated to him to rob the Child; the little innocent Creature, (ju&s;t &s;o he dream'd) not being able to re&s;i&s;t; or to tell who it was, ac|cordingly he con&s;ented to take the Money from the Child, and then to take the Diamond Neck|lace from it too, and did &s;o.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Devil,</HI> (a full Te&s;timony, as I told him, that it was the <HI>Devil)</HI> not contented with that, hinted to him, that perhaps the Child might &s;ome time or other know him, and &s;ingle him out, by crying or pointing, or &s;ome &s;uch Thing, e&s;peci|ally if he was &s;u&s;pected and &s;hew'd to it, and therefore it would be better for him to kill the Child, prompting him to kill it for his own Safety, and that he need do no more but twi&s;t the Neck of it a little, or cru&s;h it with his Knee; He told me he &s;tood debating with him&s;elf, whe|ther he &s;hould do &s;o or not; but that in that In|&s;tant his Heart &s;truck him with the Word Mur|ther, and he entertain'd a Horror of it, refus'd to do it, and immediately waked.</P>
<P>He told me, that when he wak'd, he found him&s;elf in &s;o violent a Sweat as he never had known the like; that his Pul&s;e beat with that Heat and Rage, that it was like a Palpitation of the Heart to him, and that the Agitation of his Spirits was &s;uch, that he was not fully compo|&s;ed in &s;ome Hours; tho' the Satisfaction and Joy that attended him, when he found it was but a Dream, a&s;&s;i&s;ted much to return his Spirits to their due Temperament.</P>
<P>It is neither my Bu&s;ine&s;s or Inclination to turn Divine here, nor is the Age I write to &s;uffici|ently Grave to reli&s;h a Sermon, if I was di&s;po&s;ed to preach, tho' they mu&s;t allow the Subject would very well bear it; but I &s;hall only ask them, if they think this is not the <HI>Devil,</HI> what
<PB N="363" REF="375">
they think it is? If they believe it is the <HI>Devil,</HI> they will act accordingly I hope, or let it alone, as Satan and they can agree about it.</P>
<P>I &s;hould not oblige the <HI>Devil</HI> over much, what|ever I might do to tho&s;e that read it; if I &s;hould enter here upon a Debate of Intere&s;ts, <HI>(viz.)</HI> to enquire whether the <HI>Devil</HI> has not a va&s;t Advantage upon Mankind this Way, and whether it is not much his Intere&s;t to pre&s;erve it; and if I prove the Affirmative, I leave it to you to enquire who&s;e Intere&s;t it is to di&s;appoint and &s;upplant him.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, I take Dreams to be the &s;econd Be&s;t of the Advantages the <HI>Devil</HI> has over Mankind; the fir&s;t, I &s;uppo&s;e, you all know <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Treachery of the Garri&s;on within; by Dreams he may be &s;aid to get into the In&s;ide of us with|out Oppo&s;ition; here he opens and locks with|out a Key, and like an Enemy laying &s;iege to a fortified City, Rea&s;on and Nature, the Gover|nor of the City, keep him out by Day, and keep the Garri&s;on true to their Duty; but in the Dark he gets in and parlees with the Garri&s;on (the Af|fections and Pa&s;&s;ions) Debauches their Loyalty, &s;tirring up them to Di&s;loyalty and Rebellion, &s;o they betray their Tru&s;t, Revolt, Mutiny, and go over to the Be&s;ieger.</P>
<P>Thus he manages his Intere&s;t, I &s;ay, and in&s;i|nuates him&s;elf into the In&s;ide of us, without our Con&s;ent, nay, without our Knowledge; for whatever Speculation may do, 'tis evident De|mon&s;tration does not a&s;&s;i&s;t us to di&s;cover which Way he gets Acce&s;s to the Soul, while the Or|gan tied up, and dozed with Sleep has lock'd it up from Action; that it is &s;o is clear, but how he does it is a Secret which I do not find the Antients or Moderns have yet made a Di&s;covery of.</P>
<P><PB N="364" REF="376">
That Devil of a Creature, Mother <HI>Lakland,</HI> who&s;e Story I mention'd above, acknowledg'd that the fir&s;t Time the <HI>Devil</HI> attempted to draw her in to be a Witch was in a Dream, and even when &s;he con&s;ented, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he was between &s;leeping and waking; that is, &s;he did not know whether &s;he was awake or a&s;leep, and the cun|ning Devil it &s;eems was &s;atisfied with her A&s;&s;ent given &s;o, when &s;he was a&s;leep, or neither a&s;leep or awake, &s;o taking Advantage of her Incapaci|ty to act rationally.</P>
<P>The Stories of her bewitching &s;everal People, and the Manner in which they died, are &s;o formi|dable and extravagant, that I care not to put any ones Faith to the &s;tretch about them, tho' pub|li&s;h'd by Authority, and te&s;tified by abundance of Witne&s;&s;es, but this is recorded in Particular, and to my Purpo&s;e, whether from her own Mouth or not, I do not &s;ay, namely, the De&s;cription of a Witch, and the Difference between Witches, and tho&s;e other of Satan's Acquaintance who act in his Name.</P>
<P N="1">1. They have con&s;ulted and covenanted with a Spirit or <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P N="2">2. They have a Deputy <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;ometimes &s;e|veral to &s;erve and a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P N="3">3. The&s;e they employ as they plea&s;e, call them by Name, and command their Appearance in whatever Shape they think fit.</P>
<P N="4">4. They &s;end them abroad to or into the Per|&s;ons who they de&s;ign to bewitch, who they always torment, and often murther them, as Mother <HI>Lakland</HI> did &s;everal.</P>
<P>As to the Difference between the &s;everal De|vils that appear, it relates to the Office of the Per&s;ons who employ them; as Conjurers, who

&s;eem to command the particular <HI>Devil</HI> that waits upon them with more Authority, and rai&s;e them and lay them at Plea&s;ure, drawing Circles, ca&s;ting Figures and the like; but the Witch, in a more familiar Manner, whi&s;pers with the Devil, keeps the <HI>Devil</HI> in a Bag or a Sack, &s;ometimes in her Pocket, and the like, and like Mr. <HI>Faux</HI> &s;hews Tricks with him.</P>
<P>But all the&s;e Kinds deal much in Dreams, talk with the Devil in their Sleep, and make other People talk with him in their Sleep too; and 'tis on this Occa&s;ion I mention it here; in &s;hort, the <HI>Devil</HI> may well take this Opportunity with Mankind, for not half the World that came into his Mea&s;ures would comply, if they were awake; but of that hereafter.</P>
<P>And yet his thus in&s;inuating him&s;elf by Dream, does not &s;eem &s;ufficient, in my Opinion, to an&s;wer the <HI>Devil</HI>'s End, and to carry on his Bu&s;ine&s;s; and therefore we mu&s;t be forc'd to allow him a Kind of actual Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, in particular Ca&s;es, and that in the Souls of &s;ome People, by different Methods from others; <HI>Luther</HI> is of the Opinion that the <HI>Devil</HI> gets a Familiarity with &s;ome Souls ju&s;t at, or rather before their being embodied; as to the Manner and Method how he gets in, that is another Que&s;tion, and may be &s;poken of by it &s;elf; be&s;ides, he why may not he, that at Satan's Reque&s;t to enter into the Herd of Swine, &s;aid <HI>go,</HI> give the &s;ame Commi&s;&s;ion to po&s;&s;e&s;s a Sort of Creatures &s;o many Degrees below the Dignity of the <HI>Gadarenian</HI> Swine, and open the Door too? but as for that, when our Lord &s;aid <HI>go,</HI> the <HI>Devil</HI> never enquir'd which Way he &s;hould get in.</P>
<P>When then I &s;ee Nations, or indeed Herds of Nations &s;et on Fire of Hell, and as I may &s;ay, enflam'd by the <HI>Devil;</HI> when I &s;ee Towns, Par|ties,

Factions and Rabbles of People vi&s;ibly po&s;|&s;e&s;s'd; 'tis enough to me that the great Ma&s;ter of the Devils has &s;aid to him, GO; there's no need to enquire which Way he finds open, or at what po&s;tern Gate he gets in; as to his appearing, 'tis plain he often gets in without appearing, and therefore the Que&s;tion about his appearing &s;till remains a Doubt, and is not very ea&s;y to be re|&s;olv'd.</P>
<P>In the Scripture we have &s;ome Light into it, and that is all the Help I find from Antiquity, and it goes a great Way to &s;olve the Phaenomena of Satan's appearing; what I mean by the Scripture giving &s;ome Light to it, is this; 'tis &s;aid in &s;eve|ral Places, and of &s;everal Per&s;ons, God came to them in a Dream, <HI>Gen.</HI> xx. 3. <HI>God came to</HI> Abi|melech <HI>in a Dream by Night,</HI> Gen. xxxi. 24. <HI>And God came to</HI> Laban <HI>the</HI> Syrian <HI>in a Dream,</HI> Matt. ii. 13. <HI>The Angel of the Lord appear'd to</HI> Jo&s;eph <HI>in a Dream;</HI> &s;hort Conments are &s;ufficient to plain Texts, applying this to my Friend when he wanted to be &s;atisfied about the How, relating to his Dream <HI>(viz.)</HI> how he &s;hould come to Dream &s;uch wicked Things? I told him, in &s;hort, the Ca&s;e was plain, <HI>the Devil came to him in a Dream by Night:</HI> How and in what Manner he form'd the wicked Repre&s;entations, and &s;pread debauch'd Appearances before his Fancy, by real Whi&s;pers and Voice, according to <HI>Milton,</HI> or by what other Methods; the Learn'd are not arrived to any Cer|tainty about it.</P>
<P>This leads me nece&s;&s;arily to enquire whether the <HI>Devil</HI> or &s;ome of his Agents are not always in our Company, whether they make any vi&s;ible Appearances or no? for my Part I make no Que|&s;tion of it, how el&s;e could he come at the Know|ledge of what we do; for as I can allow him no Pre&s;cience at all, as for many Rea&s;ons I have ob|&s;erv'd
<PB N="367" REF="379">
already, he mu&s;t be able to &s;ee and know us, and what we are about when we know nothing of him, or el&s;e he could know nothing of us and our Affairs; which yet we find otherwi&s;e; and this gives him infinite Advantage to Influ|ence our Actions, to judge of our Inclinations, and to bring our Pa&s;&s;ions to cla&s;h with our Rea|&s;on, as they often do, and get the better of it too.</P>
<P>All this he obtains by his being able to walk about invi&s;ible, and &s;ee when he is not &s;een, of which I have &s;poken already; hence that mo&s;t wi&s;e and &s;olid Sugge&s;tion, that when the Candles burn blew the <HI>Devil</HI> is in the Room, which great Secret in Nature, that you may more fully be convinc'd of its imaginary Reality, I mu&s;t tell you the following Story which I &s;aw in a Letter directed to a particular Friend, take it Word for Word as in the Letter; becau&s;e I do not make my &s;elf accountable for the Facts, but take them <HI>ad referendum.</HI></P>

al&s;o &s;et on another Table, the Ladies being going to Cards, al&s;o there were two large Candles in Sconces over or near the Chimney, and one more in a Looking-Gla&s;s Sconce, on a Peer by the Window.</P>
<P>With all this <HI>Apparatus,</HI> the Company &s;epara|ting &s;at down, the Gentlemen at their Table, and the Ladies at theirs, to play <HI>as above;</HI> when after &s;ome time the Gentleman of the Hou&s;e &s;aid ha&s;tily to a Servant, <HI>what a P&mdash;ails the Can|dles,</HI> and turning to the Servant raps out an Oath or two, and bids him &s;nuff the Candles, for they burnt as if the Devil was in the Room.</P>
<P>The fellow going to &s;nuff one of the Candles, &s;nuffs it out, at which his Ma&s;ter being in a Pa&s;|&s;ion the Fellow lights it again immediately at the other Candle, and then being in a little hurry, going to &s;nuff the other Candle &s;nuffed that out too.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t Candle that was relighted (as is u&s;ual in &s;uch Ca&s;es) burn'd dim and dull for a good while, and the other being out, the Room was much darker than before, and a Wench that &s;tood by the Ladies Table, bawls out to her Mi&s;|tre&s;s, <HI>Law Madam!</HI> the Candles <HI>burn blew;</HI> an old Lady that &s;at by &s;ays, <HI>ay Betty!</HI> &s;o they do; upon this one of the Ladies &s;tarts up, <HI>Mercy upon us,</HI> &s;ays &s;he, <HI>what is the Matter!</HI> In this unlucky Moment another Servant, without Orders, went to the great Peer Sconce, and becau&s;e, <HI>as he thought,</HI> he would be &s;ure to &s;nuff the Candle well, he offers to take it down, but very unhap|pily, I &s;ay, the Hook came out and down falls the Sconce Candle and all, and the Looking-Gla&s;s broke all to Pieces, with a horrible Noi&s;e; how|ever, the Candle falling out of the Sconce did not go out, but lay on the Floor burning dully, and as it is u&s;ual on &s;uch Ca&s;es, all on one
<PB N="369" REF="381">
Side, <HI>Betty</HI> cries out again, <HI>Law Madam,</HI> that Candle burns blew too; the very Moment &s;he &s;aid this, the Footman that had thrown down the Sconce, &s;ays to his fellow Servant, that came to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, <HI>I think</HI> the Devil <HI>is in the Candles to Night,</HI> and away he run out of the Room, for fear of his Ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The old Lady, who, upon the Maid <HI>Betty</HI>'s Notion of the Candles burning blew, had her Head ju&s;t full of that old <HI>Chimney-Corner Story,</HI> the Candles <HI>burn blew when Spirits are in the Room,</HI> heard the Footman &s;ay the Word <HI>Devil,</HI> but heard nothing el&s;e of what he &s;aid; upon this &s;he ri&s;es up in a terrible fright and cries out that the Footman &s;aid the <HI>Devil was in the Room;</HI> as &s;he was, indeed, frighted out of her Wits, &s;he frighted the Ladies mo&s;t terribly, and they all &s;tarting up together, down goes the Card Table, and put the Wax-Candles out.</P>
<P>Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> that had frighted them all, runs to the Sconce next the Chimney, but that ha|ving a long Snuff, &s;he cried out it burnt blew too, and &s;he dur&s;t not touch it; in &s;hort, tho' there were three Candles left &s;till burning in the Room, yet the Ladies were all &s;o frighted, that they and the Maids too run out of the Parlour &s;creaming like mad Folks. The Ma&s;ter in a Rage kick'd his fir&s;t Man out of the Room, and the &s;econd Man was run out to avoid, as I &s;aid before, the like, &s;o that no Servant was to be had, but all was in Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P>The two other Gentlemen, who were &s;itting at the fir&s;t Table, kept their Seats compo&s;ed and ea$ enough, only concern'd to &s;ee all the Hou&s;e in &s;uch fright; it was true, they &s;aid, the Can|dles burnt dim and very oddly, but they could not perceive they <HI>burnt blew,</HI> except one of tho&s;e ever the Chimney, and that on the Table, which
<PB N="370" REF="382">
was relighted after the Fellow had &s;nufft it out.</P>
<P>However, the Maid, the old Lady and the Footman that pull'd down the Sconce, all in&s;i&s;t that the Candles <HI>burnt blew,</HI> and all pretend that the Devil was certainly in the Room, and was the Occa&s;ion of it; and they now came to me with the Story, to de&s;ire my Opinion of it.</P>
<P>This put me upon Enquiry into the Notion of Candles <HI>burning blew</HI> when Spirits are in a Room, which upon all the Search into Things, that I am able to make, amounts to no more than this; that upon any extraordinary Emi&s;&s;ion of &s;ulphurous or of nitrous Particles, either in a clo&s;e Room, or in any not very open Place, if the Quantity be great, a Candle or Lamp, or any &s;uch little Blaze of Fire will &s;eem to be, or to <HI>burn blew;</HI> and if then they can prove that any &s;uch E&s;&s;luvia attends or is emitted from a Spirit, then when SATAN is at Hand it may be &s;o.</P>
<P>But then 'tis begging the Que&s;tion gro&s;sly, be|cau&s;e no Man can a&s;&s;ure us that the Devil has any &s;uch &s;ulphurous Particles about him.</P>
<P>It is true, the Candles burn thus in Mines and Vaults, and damp Places; and 'tis as true that they will do &s;o upon Occa&s;ion of very damp, &s;tormy and moi&s;t Air, when an extraordinary Quantity of Vapours are &s;uppo&s;ed to be di&s;pers'd abroad, as was the Ca&s;e when this happen'd; and if there was any Thing of that in it on that <HI>Monday</HI> Night, the Candles might, perhaps, burn blew upon that Occa&s;ion; but that the <HI>Devil</HI> was a|broad upon any extraordinary Bu&s;ine&s;s that Night, that I cannot grant, unle&s;s I have &s;ome better Te&s;timony than the <HI>old Lady</HI> that heard the Foot|man's out-cry but by halves, or than Mrs. <HI>Betty,</HI> who fir&s;t fancied the Candles <HI>burnt blew;</HI> &s;o I mu&s;t &s;u&s;pend my Judgment till I hear farther.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="383">
This Story however may &s;olve a great many of tho&s;e Things which pa&s;s for Apparitions in the World, and which are laid to the Devil's Charge, tho' he really may know nothing of the Matter; and this would bring me to defend <HI>Satan</HI> in many Things, wherein he may truly be &s;aid to &s;uffer wrong|fully; and if I thought it would oblige him, I might &s;ay &s;omething to his Advantage this Way; however, I'll venture a Word or two for an in|jur'd <HI>Devil,</HI> take it as you will.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t it is certain, that as this invi&s;ibility of the <HI>Devil</HI> is very much to our Prejudice, &s;o the Doctrine of his Vi&s;ibility is a great Prejudice to him, as we make U&s;e of it.</P>
<P>By his invi&s;ibility he is certainly ve&s;ted with infinite Advantages again&s;t us; while he can be pre&s;ent with us, and we know nothing of the Matter, he informs him&s;elf of all our Mea|&s;ures, and arms him&s;elf in the be&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ui|table Manner to injure and a&s;&s;ault us, as he can counter-act all our &s;ecret concerted De&s;igns, di&s;|appoint all our Schemes, and except when Hea|ven apparently concerns it &s;elf to over-rule him, can defeat all our Enterprizes, break all our Mea|&s;ures, and do us Mi&s;chief in almo&s;t every Part of our Life, and all this, becau&s;e we are not privy to all his Motions, as he is to ours.</P>
<P>But now for his Vi&s;ibility and his real Appea|rance in the World, and particularly among his Di&s;ciples and Emi&s;&s;aries, &s;uch as Witches and Wizards, Demonai&s;ts, and the like: Here, I think Satan has a great deal of Lo&s;s, &s;uffers manife&s;t Jnjury, and has great Inju&s;tice done him; and, that therefore I ought to clear this Matter up a little, if it be po&s;&s;ible, to do ju&s;tice to Satan, and &s;et Matters right in the World about him, accor|ding to that u&s;eful old Maxim of &s;etting the Saddle upon the right Hor&s;e, or <HI>giving the</HI> De|vil <HI>his due.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="372" REF="384">
Fir&s;t, <HI>as I have &s;aid,</HI> we are not to believe every idle Head, who pretends even to conver&s;e Face to Face with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and who tell us, they have thus &s;een him and been acquainted with him every Day: Many of the&s;e Pretenders are manife&s;t Cheats; and, however, they would have the Honour of a private Intere&s;t in him, and boa&s;t how they have him at their Beck, can call him this Way, and &s;end him that, as they plea&s;e, rai&s;e him and lay him when and how, and as often as they find for their Purpo&s;e; I &s;ay, whatever Boa&s;ts they make of this Kind, they really have no|thing of Truth in them.</P>
<P>Now the Injuries and Inju&s;tice done to the <HI>De|vil,</HI> in the&s;e Ca&s;es, are manife&s;t, namely; that they entitle the <HI>Devil</HI> to all the Mi&s;chief they are plea&s;ed to do in the World; and if they commit a Murther or a Robbery, fire a Hou&s;e, or do any Act of Violence in the World, they pre&s;ently are &s;aid to do it by the Agency of the <HI>De|vil,</HI> and the <HI>Devil</HI> helps them; &s;o Satan bears the Reproach, and they have all the Guilt; this is, (1.) a grand Cheat upon the World, and (2.) a notorious Slander upon the <HI>Devil;</HI> and it would be a public Benefit to Mankind, to have &s;uch would|be-Devils as the&s;e turn'd in&s;ide out, that we might know when the <HI>Devil</HI> was really at work among us, and when not; what Mi&s;chiefs were of his doing, and which were not; and that the&s;e Fellows might not &s;lip their Necks out of the Halter, by continually laying the Blame of their Wickedne&s;s upon the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Not that the <HI>Devil</HI> is not very willing to have his Hand in any Mi&s;chief, or in all the Mi&s;chief that is done in the World; but there are &s;ome low priz'd Rogueries that are too little for him, be|neath the Dignity of his Operation, and which 'tis really a Scandal to the <HI>Devil</HI> to charge upon
<PB N="373" REF="385">
him. I remember the <HI>Devil</HI> had &s;uch a Cheat put upon him in <HI>Ea&s;t-Smithfield</HI> once, where a Per&s;on pretended to conver&s;e with the <HI>Devil</HI> Face to Face, and that in open Day too, and to cau&s;e him to tell Fortunes, foretell Good and Evil, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> di&s;cover &s;tollen Goods, tell where they were who &s;tole them, and how to find them again, nay, and even to find out the Thieves; but <HI>Satan</HI> was really &s;landred in the Ca&s;e, the Fellow had no more to do with the <HI>Devil</HI> than other People, and perhaps not &s;o much neither: This was one of tho&s;e they call'd CUNNING-MEN, or at lea&s;t he endeavour'd to pa&s;s for &s;uch a one, but 'twas all a Cheat.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, what had the <HI>Devil</HI> to do to detect Thieves, and re&s;tore &s;tollen Goods? Thieving and Robbing, Trick and Cheat are Part of the Craft of his Agency, and of the Employments which it is his Bu&s;ine&s;s to encourage; they greatly mi&s;take him, who think he will a&s;&s;i&s;t any Body in &s;up|pre&s;&s;ing and detecting &s;uch laudable Arts and &s;uch diligent Servants.</P>
<P>I won't &s;ay, but the <HI>Devil,</HI> to draw the&s;e Peo|ple we call <HI>Cunning-Men,</HI> into a Snare, and to pu&s;h on his farther De&s;igns, may encourage them privately, and in a Manner that they them&s;elves know nothing of, to make U&s;e of his Name, and abu&s;e the World about him, till at la&s;t they may really believe they do deal with the <HI>Devil,</HI> when indeed 'tis only he deals with them, and they know nothing of the Matter.</P>
<P>In other Ca&s;es he may encourage them in the&s;e little Frauds and Cheats, and give them leave, as above, to make U&s;e of his Name to bring them afterwards, and by Degrees to have a real Acquaintance with him; &s;o bringing the Je&s;t of their Trade into Earne&s;t, till at length prompt|ing them to commit &s;ome great Villany, he &s;e|cures
<PB N="374" REF="386">
them to be his own, by their very Fear of his leaving them to be expo&s;ed to the World; thus he puts a <HI>Johnathan Wild</HI> upon them, and makes them be the very Wretches they only pre|tended to be before: So old <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> of <HI>Clithroe,</HI> as Fame tells, was twenty five Year a <HI>Cunning-Man,</HI> and twenty two Year a Witch; that is to &s;ay, for five and twenty Year, he was only pretending to deal with the <HI>Devil,</HI> when Satan and he had no manner of Acquaintance, and he only put his <HI>Leger-de-main</HI> upon the People in the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Name, without his leave; But at length the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Patience being tir'd quite out, he told the old Counterfeit, that in &s;hort, he had been his &s;talking Hor&s;e long enough, and that now, if he thought fit to enter him&s;elf, and take a Com|mi&s;&s;ion, well and good; and he &s;hould have a Lea&s;e to carry on his Trade for &s;o many Years more, to his Heart's Content; but if not, he would expo&s;e his Knavery to the World, for that he &s;hould take away his Peoples Trade no lon|ger; but that he (Satan) would &s;et up another in his Room, that &s;hould make a meer Fool of him, and carry away all his Cu&s;tomers.</P>
<P>Upon this, the old Man con&s;ider'd of it, took the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Coun&s;el, and li&s;ted in his Pay; &s;o he, that had plaid his Pranks twenty five Years as a Conjurer, when he was no Conjurer, was then forc'd really to deal with the DEVIL, for fear the People &s;hould know he did not: Till now he had <HI>ambo dexter,</HI> cheated the <HI>Devil</HI> on one Hand, and the People on the other; but the <HI>De|vil</HI> gain'd his Point at la&s;t, and &s;o he was a real Wizard ever after.</P>
<P>But this is not the only way the <HI>Devil</HI> is in|jur'd neither, for we have often found People pretend upon him in other Ca&s;es, and of nearer Concern to him a great deal, and in Articles more
<PB N="375" REF="387">
Weighty, as in particular, in the great Bu&s;ine&s;s of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; it is true this Point is not thoro'ly under&s;tood among Men, neither has the <HI>Devil</HI> thought fit to give us tho&s;e Illuminations about it, as I believe he might do; particularly that great and important Article, is not, for ought I can &s;ee, rightly explain'd, namely; whether there are not two &s;everal Kinds of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, <HI>(viz.)</HI> &s;ome wherein the <HI>Devil</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es us, and &s;ome in which we really po&s;&s;e&s;s the <HI>Devil;</HI> the Nicety of which I doubt this Age, with all its Penetration, is not qualified to explain, and a Di&s;&s;ertation upon it being too long for this Work, e&s;pecially &s;o near its Conclu&s;ion, I am oblig'd to omit, as I am al&s;o all the practical Di&s;cour&s;es up|on the U&s;efulne&s;s and Advantages of real Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion, whether con&s;ider'd one Way or other to Mankind, all which I mu&s;t leave to hereafter.</P>
<P>But to come back to the Point in Hand, and to con&s;ider the Inju&s;tice done to the <HI>Devil,</HI> in the various Turns and Tricks which Men put up|on him very often in this one Article, <HI>(viz.)</HI> pretend|ing to Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and to have the <HI>Devil</HI> in them, when really it is not &s;o; certainly the Devil mu&s;t take it very ill, to have all their demented, luna|tick Tricks charg'd upon him; &s;ome of which, nay, mo&s;t of which are &s;o gro&s;s, &s;o &s;imple, &s;o empty, and &s;o little to the Purpo&s;e, that the <HI>Devil</HI> mu&s;t be a&s;ham'd to &s;ee &s;uch Things pa&s;s in his Name, or that the World &s;hould think he was concern'd in them.</P>
<P>It is true, that Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion being one of the principal Pieces of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Artifice in his managing Mankind, and in which, with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite skill he plays the <HI>Devil</HI> among us, he has the more Rea&s;on to be affronted when he finds him&s;elf invaded in this Part, and angry that any body &s;hould pretend to po&s;&s;e&s;s, or be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
<PB N="376" REF="388">
without his leave; and this may be the Rea&s;on, for ought we know, why &s;o many Blunders have been made, when People have pretended to it without him, and he has thought fit not to own them in it; of which we have many Ex|amples in Hi&s;tory, as in <HI>Simon Magus, the Devil of</HI> London, <HI>the fair Maid of</HI> Kent, and &s;everal others who&s;e Hi&s;tory it is not worth while to en|large upon.</P>
<P>In &s;hort, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions as I have &s;aid, are nice Things, and it is not &s;o ea&s;y to mimick the <HI>De|vil</HI> in that Part, as it may be in &s;ome other; de|&s;igning Men have attempted it often, but their Manner has been ea&s;ily di&s;tingui&s;h'd, even with|out the Devil's A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>Thus the People of <HI>Salem</HI> in <HI>New-England</HI> pretended to be bewitch'd, and that a black Man tormened them by the In&s;tigation of &s;uch and &s;uch, whom they re&s;olv'd to bring to the Gal|lows: This black Man they would have be the <HI>Devil,</HI> employ'd by the Per&s;on who they accus'd for a Witch: Thus making the <HI>Devil</HI> a Page or a Footman to the Wizard, to go and torment whoever the &s;aid Wizard commanded, till the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf was &s;o weary of the fooli&s;h Part, that he left them to go on their own Way, and at la&s;t they over-acted the murthering Part &s;o far, that when they confe&s;s'd them&s;elves to be Witches, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and that they had Corre&s;pondence with the Devil, <HI>Satan</HI> not appearing to vouch for them, no Jury would condemn them upon their own Evidence, and they could not get them&s;elves hang'd, whatever Pains they took to bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Thus you &s;ec the <HI>Devil</HI> may be wrong'd, and fal&s;ely accus'd in many Particulars, and often has been &s;o; there are likewi&s;e &s;ome other Sorts of counterfeit <HI>Devils</HI> in the World, &s;uch as <HI>Gyp|&s;ies,</HI>

<P>The&s;e I take to be Interlopers, or with the <HI>Guinea</HI> Merchants leave, Separate Traders, and who act under the Skreen and Protection of Sa|tan's Power, but without his Licen&s;e or Autho|rity; no Doubt the&s;e carry away a great deal of his Trade, that is to &s;ay, the Trade which other|wi&s;e the <HI>Devil</HI> might have carried on by Agents of his own; I cannot but &s;ay, that while the&s;e People would fain be thought <HI>Devils,</HI> tho' they really are not, it is but ju&s;t they &s;hould be real|ly made as much <HI>Devils</HI> as they pretended to be, or that <HI>Satan</HI> &s;hould do him&s;elf Ju&s;tice upon them, as he threaten'd to do upon old <HI>Par&s;ons</HI> of <HI>Clithroe</HI> above mention'd, and let the World know them.</P>

<P>Thus the Magi&s;trates of <HI>Bern</HI> in <HI>Switzerland,</HI> finding a Gang of <HI>French</HI> Actors of Puppet-&s;how open'd their Stage in the Town, upon hearing the &s;urprizing Accounts which the People gave of their wonderful Puppets, how they made them &s;peak, an&s;wer Que&s;tions, and di&s;cour&s;e, appear and di&s;appear in a Moment, pop up here, as if they ri&s;e out of the Earth, and down there, as if they vani&s;h'd, and abundance more Feats of Art, con&s;ur'd them as Demons; and if they had not pack'd up their Trinkets, and di&s;appear|ed almo&s;t as dextrou&s;ly as their Puppets, they had certainly condemn'd the poor Puppets to the Flames for <HI>Devils,</HI> and cen&s;ur'd, if not otherwi&s;e pu|ni&s;hed their Ma&s;ters.

<P>Wonderful Operations a&s;toni&s;h the Mind, e|&s;pecially where the Head is not over-burthen'd with Brains; and Cu&s;tom has made it &s;o natural to give the <HI>Devil</HI> either the Honour or Scandal of every Thing, that we cannot otherwi&s;e Ac|count for, that it is not po&s;&s;ible to put the Peo|ple out of the Road of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Magicians</HI> were, in the <HI>Chaldean</HI> Monar|chy, call'd the Wi&s;emen; and tho' they are join|ed with the Sorcerers and A&s;trologers in the &s;ame Place, <HI>Daniel</HI> ii. 4. yet they were gene|rally &s;o under&s;tood among tho&s;e People; but in our Language we under&s;tand them to be Peo|ple that have an Art to reveal Secrets, interpret Dreams, foretell Events, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> and that u&s;e En|chantments and Sorceries, by all which we un|der&s;tand the &s;ame Thing; which now in a more vulgar Way we expre&s;s by one general coar&s;e Ex|pre&s;&s;ion, <HI>Dealing with the</HI> DEVIL.</P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="395">
The Scripture &s;peaks of a Spirit of <HI>Divination, Acts</HI> xvi. 16. and a Wench that was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by this Spirit <HI>brought her Ma&s;ter much Gain by South|&s;aying,</HI> that is to &s;ay, according to the Learned, by <HI>Oracling</HI> or an&s;wering Que&s;tions; whence you will &s;ee in the Margin, that this &s;outh&s;aying <HI>Devil</HI> is there call'd <HI>Python,</HI> that is, <HI>Apollo,</HI> who is often call'd <HI>Python,</HI> and who at the Oracle of <HI>Del|phos</HI> gave out &s;uch An&s;wers and <HI>double Entendres,</HI> as this Weach po&s;&s;ibly did; and hence all tho&s;e Spirits which were call'd Spirits of Divination, were in another Sen&s;e call'd <HI>Pythons.</HI></P>
<P>Now when the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> came to &s;ee this Creature, this Spirit takes upon it to declare that <HI>tho&s;e Men,</HI> meaning St. <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Timo|theus, were the Servants of the mo&s;t high God, which &s;hew'd unto them the Way of Salvation;</HI> this was a good turn of the <HI>Devil,</HI> to pre&s;erve his Authority in the po&s;&s;e&s;s'd Girl; &s;he brought them Gain by South&s;aying, that is to &s;ay, re&s;olving dif|ficult Que&s;tions, an&s;wering Doubts, interpreting Dreams, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Among the&s;e Doubts, he makes her give Te&s;timony to <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Timotheus,</HI> to wheedle in with the new Chri&s;tians, and perhaps (tho' very ignorantly) even with <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Timo|theus</HI> them&s;elves, &s;o to give a Kind of Credit and Re&s;pect to her for &s;peaking.</P>
<P>But the <HI>Devil,</HI> who never &s;peaks Truth, but with &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter End, was di&s;cover'd here and detect|ed; his flattering Recognition not accepted, and he him&s;elf unkennel'd as he de&s;erv'd; There the <HI>Devil</HI> was over-&s;hot in his own Bow again.</P>
<P>Here now was a real Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and the evil Spirits who po&s;&s;e&s;s'd her, did &s;toop to &s;undry lit|tle Acts of Servitude, that we could give little or no Rea&s;on for, only that the Girl's Ma&s;ter might get Money by her; but perhaps this was a par|ticular Ca&s;e, and prepar'd to Honour the Au|thority
<PB N="382" REF="396">
and Power the Apo&s;tles had over evil Spirits.</P>
<P>But we find the&s;e Things carried a great Way farther in many Ca&s;es, that is to &s;ay, where the Parties are thus really po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; namely, the <HI>De|vil</HI> makes Agents of the po&s;&s;e&s;s'd Parties to do many Things for the Propagating his Intere&s;t and Kingdom, and particularly for the carrying on his Dominion in the World: But I am for the Pre&s;ent not &s;o much upon the real Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion as the pretended, and particularly we have had many that have believed them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, when the <HI>Devil</HI> never believed it of them, and perhaps knew them better; &s;ome of the&s;e are real|ly poor <HI>Devils</HI> to be pitied, and are what I call <HI>Diables Imaginaire;</HI> the&s;e have notwith&s;tanding done the <HI>Devil</HI> good Service, and brought their Ma&s;ters good Gain by South&s;aying.</P>
<P>We find Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions acknowledg'd in Scripture to be really and per&s;onally the <HI>Devil,</HI> or accor|ding to the Text, Legions of <HI>Devils</HI> in the Plu|ral. The <HI>Devil</HI> or <HI>Devils</HI> rather, which po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed the Man among the Tombs, is po&s;itively af|firm'd to be the <HI>Devil</HI> in the Scripture; all the Evangeli&s;ts agree in calling him &s;o, and his very Works &s;hew it; namely, the Mi&s;chief he did, as well to the poor Creature among the Tombs, who was made &s;o fierce, that he was the Terror of all the Country, as to the Herd of Swine and to the Country in the Lo&s;s of them.</P>
<P>I might preach you a Lecture here of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Terror upon the Approach of our Saviour, the Dread of his Government, and how he ac|knowledg'd that there was a Time for his Tor|ment, which was not yet come: <HI>Art thou come to Torment us before our Time?</HI> It is evident the De|vil apprehended that Chri&s;t would Chain them up before the Day of Judgment; and therefore &s;ome think the Devil here, being, as it were,
<PB N="383" REF="397">
caught out of his due Bounds, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing the poor Man in &s;uch a furious Manner, was afraid, and petition'd Chri&s;t not to Chain him up for it, and as the Text &s;ays, <HI>They be&s;ought him to &s;uffer them to go away,</HI> &amp;c. that is to &s;ay, when they &s;ay, art thou come to Torment us before the Time? the Meaning is, they begg'd he would not ca&s;t them into Torment before the Time, which was already fix'd; but that if he would ca&s;t them out of the Man, they would let them go away, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>The Evangeli&s;t St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays, the <HI>Devil be|&s;ought him that he would not command them to go out into the Deep:</HI> Our learned Annotators think that part is not rightly render'd; adding, that they do not believe the <HI>Devil</HI> fears drowning; but with Submi&s;&s;ion, I believe the meaning is, that they would not be confin'd to the va&s;t Ocean, where no Inhabitants being to be &s;een, they would be ef|fectually impri&s;on'd and tied down from doing Mi&s;|chief, which would be a Hell to them; as to their going into the Swine, that might afford us &s;ome Al|legory; but I am not di&s;po&s;ed to je&s;t with the Scrip|ture, no nor with the <HI>Devil</HI> neither, farther than needs mu&s;t.</P>
<P>It is evident the <HI>Devil</HI> makes U&s;e of very mean In&s;truments &s;ometimes, &s;uch as the Dam&s;el po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with a Spirit of Divination, and &s;everal others.</P>
<P>I remember a Story, how true I know not, of a weak Creature next Door to an Ideot, who was e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Country for an Oracle, and would tell People &s;trange Things that &s;hould be, long before they came to pa&s;s; when People were &s;ick, would tell them whether they &s;hould live or die; if People were married, tell how many Children they &s;hould have; and a hundred &s;uch Things as fill'd the People with Admiration, and they were the ea&s;ier brought to believe that the Girl was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; but then they were divided about
<PB N="374" REF="398">
her too, and that was the fine&s;t &s;pun Thread the Devil could Work, for he carried a great Point in it; &s;ome &s;aid &s;he had a good Spirit, and &s;ome a bad, &s;ome &s;aid &s;he was a Prophete&s;s, and &s;ome that &s;he was the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>Now had I been there to decide the Que&s;tion, I &s;hould certainly have given it for the Latter; if it were only upon this Account, namely, that the Devil has often found Fools very nece&s;&s;ary Agents for the Propagating his Intere&s;t and King|dom, but we never knew the good Spirits do &s;o; on the other Hand, it does not &s;eem likely that Heaven &s;hould deprive a poor Creature of its Sen&s;es, and as it were take her Soul from her, and then make her an In&s;trument of In&s;truction to others, and an Oracle to declare his Decrees by; this does not &s;eem to be rational.</P>
<P>But as far as this Kind of Divination is in U&s;e in our Days, yet I do not find Room to charge the Devil with making any great U&s;e of Fools, unle&s;s it be &s;uch as he has particularly qua|lified for his Work, for as to <HI>Ideots</HI> and <HI>Natu|rals,</HI> they are perfectly u&s;ele&s;s to him; but a Sort of Fools call'd the Magi, indeed, we have &s;ome Rea&s;on to think he often works with.</P>
<P>We are not arriv'd to a certainty yet, in the &s;et|tling this great Point, namely, what Magic is? whether a diabolical Art or a Branch of the Ma|thematicks? Our mo&s;t learned <HI>Lexicon Technicum</HI> is of the latter Opinion, and gives the <HI>Magic Square</HI> and the <HI>Magic Lantern,</HI> two Terms of Art.</P>
<P>The <HI>Magic Square</HI> is when Numbers in <HI>Arith|metical Proportion</HI> are di&s;po&s;s'd into &s;uch Parallels or equal Ranks, as that the Sums of each Row as well <HI>Diagonally</HI> as <HI>Laterally</HI> &s;hall be all equal; for Example, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10. Place the&s;e Nine in a Square of three, they will <HI>direct|ly</HI> and <HI>diagonally</HI> make 18. Thus,</P>

<P>This he calls the <HI>Magic Square,</HI> but gives no Rea&s;on for the Term, nor any Account of what infer|nal Operations are wrought by this Concurrence of the Num|bers; neither do I &s;ee that there can be any &s;uch U&s;e made of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Magic Lantern</HI> is an optic Machine, by the Means of which are repre&s;ented, on a Wall in the Dark, many Phanto&s;ms and terrible Appea|rances, <HI>but no</HI> Devil <HI>in all this,</HI> only that they are taken for the Effects of Magic, by tho&s;e that are not acquainted with the Secret.</P>
<P>All this is done by the Help of &s;everal little painted Pieces of Gla&s;s, only &s;o and &s;o &s;ituated, plac'd in certain Oppo&s;itions to one another, and painted with different Figures, the mo&s;t formida|ble being plac'd foremo&s;t, and &s;uch as are mo&s;t capable of terrifying the Spectators; and by this all the Figures may be repre&s;ented upon the op|po&s;ite Wall, in the large&s;t Size.</P>
<P>I cannot but take Notice, that this very Piece of Optic Delu&s;ion &s;eems too much akin to the mock Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and infernal Accompli&s;hments, which mo&s;t of the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ioni&s;ts of this Age pretend to, &s;o that they are mo&s;t of them meer Phanto&s;ms and Appearances and no more; Nor is the Spirit of Divination, the Magic, the Necromancing, and other Arts which were call'd Diabolical, found to be of any U&s;e in modern Practice, at lea&s;t, in the&s;e Parts of the World; but the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;eems to do mo&s;t of his Work him&s;elf, and by &s;horter Me|thods; for he has &s;o compleat an Influence among tho&s;e that he now Li&s;ts in his Service, that he brings all the common Affairs of Mankind into a narrower Compa&s;s in his Management, with a
<PB N="386" REF="400">
Dexterity particular to him&s;elf, and by which he carries on his Intere&s;t &s;ilently and &s;urely, much more to the Detriment of Virtue and good Go|vernment, and con&s;equently much more to his Satisfaction, than ever he did before.</P>
<P>There is a Kind of <HI>Magic</HI> or <HI>Sorcery,</HI> or what el&s;e you may plea&s;e to call it, which, tho' un|known to us, is yet, it &s;eems, &s;till very much en|courag'd by the <HI>Devil;</HI> but this is a great Way off, and in Countries where the politer In&s;truments, which he finds here, are not to be had; namely, a|mong the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>North-America;</HI> This is call'd <HI>Pawawing,</HI> and they have their Divines, which they call <HI>Pawaws</HI> or Witches, who u&s;e &s;trange Ge&s;tures, Di&s;tortions, horrid Smokes, Burnings, and Scents, and &s;everal &s;uch Things which the Sorcerers and Witches in antient Times are &s;aid to u&s;e in ca&s;ting Nativities, in Philtres, and in determining, or as they pretended, directing the Fate of Per&s;ons; by burning &s;uch and &s;uch Herbs and Roots, &s;uch as <HI>Helebore, Wormwood, Storax, Devilwort, Mandrake, Night&s;hade,</HI> and abun|dance more &s;uch, which are call'd noxious Plants, or the Product of noxious Plants; al&s;o melting &s;uch and &s;uch Minerals, Gums, and poi&s;onous Things, and by &s;everal helli&s;h Mutterings and Markings over them, the like do the&s;e <HI>Pawaws;</HI> and the <HI>Devil</HI> is plea&s;ed, it &s;eems, (or is permitted) to fall in with the&s;e Things, and as &s;ome People think, appears often to them for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance upon tho&s;e Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>But be that as it will, he is eas'd of all that Trouble here; he can <HI>Pawaw</HI> here him&s;elf, with|out their aid, and having laid them all a&s;ide, he ne|gotiates much of his Bu&s;ine&s;s without Amba&s;&s;adors; he is his own Plenipotentiary, for he finds Man &s;o ea&s;y to come at, and &s;o ea&s;y when he is come at, that he &s;tands in no need of &s;ecret Emi&s;&s;aries, or at lea&s;t not &s;o much as he u&s;ed to do.</P>

Upon the whole, as the World, within the Compa&s;s of a few pa&s;s'd Years is advanc'd in all Kinds of Knowledge and Arts, and every u&s;eful Branch of what they knew before improv'd, and innumerable u&s;eful Parts of Knowledge, which were conceal'd before are di&s;cover'd; why &s;hould we think the <HI>Devil</HI> alone &s;hould &s;tand at a &s;tay, has taken no Steps to his farther Accompli&s;h|ment, and made no u&s;eful Di&s;coveries in his Way? that he alone &s;hould &s;tand at a Stay, and be ju&s;t the &s;ame unimprov'd <HI>Devil</HI> that he was before? No, no, as the World is improv'd every Day, and every Age is grown wi&s;er and wi&s;er than their Fa|thers; &s;o, no doubt, he has be&s;tirr'd him&s;elf too, in order to an encrea&s;e of Knowledge and Di&s;co|very, and that he finds every Day a nearer Way to go to work with Mankind than he had before.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, as Men in general &s;eem to have alter'd their Manner, and that they move in a higher and more exalted Sphere, e&s;pecially as to Vice and Virtue; &s;o the <HI>Devil</HI> may have been obli|ed to change his Mea&s;ures, and alter his Way of working; particularly, tho&s;e Things which would take in former Times, and which a &s;tupid Age would come ea&s;ily into, won't go down with us now: As the ta&s;te of Vice and Virtue alters, the <HI>Devil</HI> is forc'd to bait his Hook with new Compo&s;itions; the very Thing call'd Temptation is alter'd in its Nature, and that which &s;erv'd to delude our Ance&s;tors, who&s;e gro&s;s Concep|tions of Things cau&s;ed them to be manageable with le&s;s Art, will not do now; the Ca&s;e is quite alter'd; in &s;ome Things, perhaps, as I hinted above; we come into Crime with ea&s;e, and may be led by a Finger; but when we come to a more refin'd Way of &s;inning, which our Ance&s;tors ne|ver under&s;tood, other and more refin'd Politics mu&s;t be made U&s;e of, and the <HI>Devil</HI> has been put
<PB N="388" REF="402">
upon many u&s;eful Projects and Inventions, to make many new Di&s;coveries and Experiments to carry on his Affairs; and to &s;peak impartially, he is &s;trangely improv'd either in Knowledge or Experiment, within the&s;e few Years; he has found out a great many new Inventions to &s;horten his own Labour, and carry on his Bu&s;ine&s;s in the World currently, which he never was ma&s;ter of before, or at lea&s;t we never knew he was.</P>
<P>No wonder then that he has chang'd Hands too, and that he has left off <HI>pawawing</HI> in the&s;e Parts of the World; that we don't find our Hou&s;es di&s;turb'd as they u&s;ed to be, and the Stools and Chairs walking about out of one Room into another, as formerly; that Children don't vomit crooked Pins and ru&s;ty &s;tub Nails, as of old, the Air is not full of Noi&s;es, nor the Church-Yard full of Hobgoblins; Gho&s;ts don't walk about in Winding-Sheets, and the good old &s;colding Wives vi&s;it and plague their Husbands after they are dead, as they did when they were alive.</P>
<P>The Age is grown too wi&s;e to be agitated by the&s;e dull &s;car-crow Things which their Fore-Fathers were tickled with; <HI>Satan</HI> has been obli|ged to lay by his Puppet-&s;hews and his Tum|blers, tho&s;e things are grown &s;tale; his morrice|dancing <HI>Devils,</HI> his mountebanking and quacking won't do now; tho&s;e Things, as they may be &s;up|po&s;ed to be very trouble&s;ome to him, (and but that he has Servants enough would be chargeable too) are now of no great U&s;e in the new Ma|nagement of his Affairs.</P>
<P><HI>In a Word,</HI> Men are too much <HI>Devils</HI> them|&s;elves, in the Sen&s;e that I have call'd them &s;o, to be frighted with &s;uch little low priz'd Ap|pearances as the&s;e; they are better acquainted with

the old Arch-Angel than &s;o, and they &s;eem to tell him they mu&s;t be treated after another Man|ner, and that then, as they are good natur'd and tractable, he may deal with them upon better Terms.</P>
<P>Hence the <HI>Devil</HI> goes to work with Mankind a much &s;horter Way; for in&s;tead of the Art of Wheedling and Whining, together with the la|borious Part of Tricking and Sharping, Hurry|ing and Driving, Frighting and Terrifying, all which the <HI>Devil</HI> was put to the Trouble of before; in &s;hort, he acts the GRAND MANNER as the Architects call it (I don't know whether our Free-Ma&s;ons may under&s;tand the Word) and therefore I may hereafter explain it, as it is to be Diaboli|cally as well as mathematically under&s;tood.</P>
<P>At pre&s;ent my meaning is, he acts with them immediately and per&s;onally by a magnificent Tran&s;|formation, making them meer <HI>Devils</HI> to them|&s;elves, upon all needful Occa&s;ions, and <HI>Devils</HI> to one another too, whenever he (Satan) has Need of their Service.</P>
<P>This Way of embarking Mankind in the <HI>De|vil</HI>'s particular Engagement, is really very mo|dern; and tho' the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf may have been long acquainted with the Method, and as I have heard, began to practi&s;e it towards the Clo&s;e of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, when Men began to act up|on very polite Principles, and were capable of the mo&s;t refin'd Wickedne&s;s, and afterwards with &s;ome Popes, who likewi&s;e were a kind of Church <HI>Devils,</HI> &s;uch as Satan him&s;elf could hardly expect to find in the World; yet I do not find that he was ever able to bring it into Practice, at lea&s;t, not &s;o univer&s;ally as he does now: But now the Ca&s;e is alter'd, and Men being generally more expert in Wickedne&s;s than they were formerly; they &s;uffer the &s;maller Alteration of the Species, in
<PB N="390" REF="404">
being tran&s;migrated; in a Word, they turn into <HI>Devils</HI> with no trouble at all hardly, either to the <HI>Devil</HI> or to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This Particular would want much the le&s;s Ex|planation, could I obtain a Licen&s;e from Sir <HI>Hel|lebore Wormwood,</HI> Bart. or from my Lord <HI>Thwart|over,</HI> Baron of <HI>Scoundrel Hall</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to write the true Hi&s;tory of their own Conduct; and how early, and above all, how ea&s;ily they commenc'd <HI>Devils,</HI> without the lea&s;t Impeachment of their Characters, as wi&s;e Men, and without any Diminution of that Part of their Denomination which e&s;tabli&s;h'd them for Fools.</P>
<P>How many mad Fellows appear among us every Day in the critical Juncture of their Tran&s;mi|gration, ju&s;t when they have &s;o much of the Man left as to be known by their Names, and enough of the <HI>Devil</HI> taken up to &s;ettle their Cha|racters? This Ea&s;ine&s;s of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s acce&s;s to the&s;e People, and the great Convenience it is to him in his general Bu&s;ine&s;s, is a Proof to me that he has no more Occa&s;ion of Diviners, Magi|cians, Sorcerers, and whatever el&s;e we plea&s;e to call tho&s;e People who were formerly &s;o great with him; for what Occa&s;ion has he to employ <HI>Devils</HI> and Wizards to confound Mankind, when he is arriv'd to &s;uch a Perfection of Art as to bring Men, at lea&s;t in the&s;e Parts of the World, to do it all them&s;elves; upon this Account we do not find any of the old Sorcerers and Diviners, Magici|ans or Witches appear among us; not that the <HI>Devil</HI> might not be as well able to employ &s;uch People as formerly, and qualify them for the Em|ployment too, but that really there is no need of them hereabout, the <HI>Devil</HI> having a &s;horter Way, and Mankind being much more ea&s;ily po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; not the old <HI>Herd of Swine</HI> were &s;ooner agitated, tho' there was full 2000 of them together; Na|ture

<P>Nor let any Man be alarm'd at this Alteration, in the Ca&s;e, as it &s;tands between Mankind and the <HI>Devil,</HI> and think the <HI>Devil</HI> having gain'd &s;o much Ground may in time, by Encroachment, come to a general Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole Race, and &s;o we &s;hould all come to be <HI>Devils</HI> incarnate; I &s;ay, let us not be alarm'd, for Satan does not get the&s;e Advantages by Encroachment, and by his infernal Power or Art, no not at all; but 'tis the Man him&s;elf does it by his Indolence and Neg|ligence on one Hand, and his Complai&s;ance to the <HI>Devil</HI> on the other; and both Ways he, as it were, opens the Door to him, beckons him with his very Hand to come in, and the Devil has nothing to do but enter and take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: Now if it be &s;o, and Man is &s;o frank to him; you know the <HI>Devil</HI> is no Fool not to take the Advantage when 'tis offer'd him, and therefore 'tis no won|der if the Con&s;equences which I have been ju&s;t now naming follow.</P>
<P>But let no Man be di&s;courag'd by this, from rea&s;&s;uming his natural and religious Powers, and venturing to &s;hut the <HI>Devil</HI> out; for the Ca&s;e is plain he may be &s;hut out; the Soul is a &s;trong Ca&s;|tle, and has a good Garri&s;on plac'd within to defend it; if the Garri&s;on behave well, and do their Duty, it is impregnable, and the cowardly <HI>Devil</HI> mu&s;t rai&s;e his Siege and be gone; nay, he mu&s;t fly, or, as we call it, make his E&s;cape, le&s;t he be lay'd by the Heels, that is, le&s;t his Weak|ne&s;s be expo&s;ed, and all his Lurking, lying in Wait, ambu&s;cade-Tricks; this Part would bear a great Enlargement, but I have not Room to be witty upon him, &s;o you mu&s;t take it in the Gro&s;s, the DEVIL lies at <HI>Blye Bu&s;h,</HI> as our Coun|try
<PB N="392" REF="406">
People call it, to watch your coming out of your Hold; and if you happen to go abroad un|arm'd he &s;eizes upon and ma&s;ters you with ea&s;e.</P>
<P>Unarm'd, you'll &s;ay, what Arms &s;hould I take? what Fence again&s;t a Flail? What Weapons can a Man take to fight the <HI>Devil?</HI> I could tell you what to fight him with, and what you might fright him with, for the <HI>Devil</HI> is to be fright|ed with &s;everal Things be&s;ides <HI>Holy Water;</HI> but 'tis too &s;erious for you, and you'll tell me I am a Preaching and a Canting, and the like; &s;o I mu&s;t let the <HI>Devil</HI> manage you rather than di&s;plea&s;e you with talking Scripture and Religion.</P>
<P>Well, but may not the <HI>Devil</HI> be fought, with &s;ome of his own Weapons? Is there no dealing with him in a Way of human Nature? This would require a long an&s;wer, and &s;ome Philo&s;o|phy might be acted, or at lea&s;t imitated, and &s;ome Magic, perhaps; for they tells us there are Spells to draw away even the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf; as in &s;ome Places they nail Hor&s;e-Shoes upon the Thre&s;hold of the Door, to keep him out; in other Places old Pieces of Flint, with &s;o many Holes and &s;o many Corners, and the like: But I mu&s;t an&s;wer in the Negative, I don't know what <HI>Satan</HI> might be &s;car'd at in tho&s;e Days, but he is either grown cunninger &s;ince or bolder, for he values none of tho&s;e Things now; I que&s;tion much whether he would value St. <HI>Dun&s;tan</HI> and his red hot Tongs, if he was to meet him now, or St. <HI>Francis</HI> or any of the Saints, no not the Ho&s;t it&s;elf in full Proce&s;&s;ion; and therefore, tho' you don't Care I &s;hould preach, yet in &s;hort, if you are afraid he &s;hould charge upon you and attack you, if you won't make U&s;e of tho&s;e Scripture Weapons I &s;hould have mention'd, and which you may hear of, if you enquire at <HI>Eph.</HI> vi. 16. you mu&s;t look for better where you think you can find them.</P>
<P><PB N="393" REF="407">
But to go on with my Work, the <HI>Devil,</HI> I &s;ay, is not to be &s;car'd with Maukins, nor does he employ his old In&s;truments, but does much of his Work him&s;elf without In&s;truments.</P>
<P>And yet I mu&s;t enter a Caveat here too, again&s;t being mi&s;under&s;tood in my &s;aying the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;tands in need of no Agents; for when I &s;peak &s;o, I am to be taken in a limited Sen&s;e; I don't &s;ay he needs them no where, but only that he does not need them in tho&s;e polite Parts of the World which I have been &s;peaking of, and perhaps not much here; but in many remote Countries 'tis otherwi&s;e &s;till; the <HI>Indians</HI> of <HI>America</HI> are particularly &s;aid to have Witches among them, as well in tho&s;e Countries where the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> and other Nations have planted them|&s;elves, as among&s;t tho&s;e where the <HI>European</HI> Nati|ons &s;eldom come: <HI>for Example,</HI> the People of <HI>Ca|nada,</HI> that is, of the Countries under the <HI>French</HI> Government of <HI>Quebeck,</HI> the Exquimeaux, and other Northern Climates, have Magicians, Wizards and Witches, who they call <HI>Pilloatas</HI> or <HI>Pillo|toas;</HI> the&s;e pretend they &s;peak intimately and fa|miliarly with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and receive from him the Knowledge of Things to come; all which, by the Way, I take to be little more than this; that the&s;e Fellows being a little more cunning than the re&s;t, think, that by pretending to &s;ome|thing more than human, they &s;hall make the &s;tronger Impre&s;&s;ions on the ignorant People; as <HI>Mahomet</HI> amus'd the World with his Pigeon, u&s;ing it to pick Peas out of his Ear, and per|&s;uaded the People it brought him &s;uperior Re|velations and In&s;pirations from Paradi&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus the&s;e <HI>Pillotoas</HI> gaining an Opinion among the People, behave like &s;o many Mountebanks of Hell, pretending to under&s;tand dark Things, cure Di&s;ea&s;es, practi&s;e Surgery, Phy&s;ick and
<PB N="394" REF="408">
Necromancy altogether; I will not &s;ay, but <HI>Sa|tan</HI> may pick out &s;uch Tools to work with, and I believe does in tho&s;e Parts, but I think he has found a nearer Way to the Wood with us, and that is &s;ufficient to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Some would per&s;uade me the <HI>Devil</HI> had a great Hand in the late religious Breaches in <HI>France,</HI> among the Clergy, <HI>(viz.)</HI> about the Pope's Con&s;ti|tution <HI>Unigentitus,</HI> and that he made a fair Attempt to &s;et the Pope and the <HI>Gallican</HI> Church together by the Ears, for they were all ju&s;t upon the Point of breaking out into a Church War, that for ought we knew might have gone far|ther than the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf car'd it &s;hould; now I am of the quite contrary Opinion, I believe the <HI>Devil</HI> really did not make the Breach, but rather heal'd it, for fear it &s;hould have gone &s;o far among them as to have &s;et them all in a Flame, and have open'd the Door to the Return of the <HI>Hugonots</HI> again, which it was in a fair Way to have done.</P>
<P>But be it one Way or t'other, the hi&s;torical Part &s;eems to be a little again&s;t me; for 'tis cer|tain, the <HI>Devil</HI> both wanted and made U&s;e of Legions of Agents, as well human as infernal, vi|&s;ible and invi&s;ible in that great and important Af|fair, and we cannot doubt but he has innumera|ble In&s;truments &s;till at work about it.</P>
<P>Like as in <HI>Poland,</HI> I make no Que&s;tion but the <HI>Devil</HI> has thou&s;ands of his Banditti at work at this Time, and in another Country not far from it, perhaps, preparing Matters for the next Gene|ral Diet, taking care to prevent giving any Re|laxation to the Prote&s;tants, and to ju&s;tify the moderate Executions at <HI>Thorn,</HI> to excite a Na|tion to quarrel with every Body who are able to fight with no body; to erect the apo&s;tate Race of <HI>S&mdash;y</HI> upon a Throne which they have no Ti|tle to, and turn an elective Throne into an here|ditary, in favour of Popery.</P>
<P><PB N="395" REF="409">
I might anticipate all your Objections, by granting the bu&s;y <HI>Devil</HI> at this Time employing all his Agents and In&s;truments, (for I never told you they were idle and u&s;ele&s;s) in &s;triving to en|flame the Chri&s;tian World, and bring a new War to over&s;pread <HI>Europe;</HI> I might, perhaps, point out to you &s;ome of the Mea&s;ures he takes, the Provocatives which his State Phy&s;icians Ad|mini&s;ter to the Courts and Coun&s;ellors of Princes, to foment and ferment the Spirits, and Members of Nations, Kingdoms, Empires and States in the World, in order to bring the&s;e glorious Ends of Blood and War to pa&s;s; for you cannot think but he that knows &s;o much of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Af|fairs, as to write his Hi&s;tory, mu&s;t know &s;ome|thing of all the&s;e Matters more than tho&s;e that do not know &s;o much as he.</P>
<P>But all this is remote to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, for this is no Impeachment of Satan's new Methods with Mankind, in this Part of the World, and in his private and &s;eparate Capacity; all this only &s;ignifies that in his more general and national Af|fairs, the <HI>Devil</HI> acts &s;till by his old Methods; and when he is to &s;educe or embroil Nations, he, like other Conquerors, &s;ubdues them by Armies, em|ploys mighty Squadrons of <HI>Devils,</HI> and &s;ends out &s;trong Detachments, with Generals and Gene|rali&s;&s;imos to lead them, &s;ome to one Part of the World, &s;ome to another; &s;ome to influence one Nation, &s;ome to manage and direct another, according as Bu&s;ine&s;s pre&s;ents, and his Occa&s;ions require, that his Affairs may be carried on cur|rently, and to his Satisfaction.</P>
<P>If it were not thus, but that the <HI>Devil</HI> by his new and exqui&s;ite Management, of which I have &s;aid &s;o much, had brought Mankind in General to be the Agents of their own Mi&s;chiefs, and that the World were &s;o at his Beck, that he
<PB N="396" REF="410">
need but command them to go and fight, declare War, rai&s;e Armies, de&s;troy Cities, Kingdoms, Countries and People; the World would be a Field of Blood indeed, and all Things would run into Confu&s;ion pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>But this is not the Ca&s;e at all, Heaven has not let go the Government of the Creation to his &s;ubdu'd Enemy, the <HI>Devil;</HI> that would over|turn the whole Sy&s;tem of God, and give Sa|tan more Power, than ever he was or will be ve&s;ted with; when, therefore, I &s;peak of a few forward Wretches in our Day, who are &s;o warm in their Wickedne&s;s, that they anticipate the <HI>Devil,</HI> &s;ave him the Trouble to tempt, turn <HI>Devils</HI> to them&s;elves, and gallop Hellward fa&s;ter than he drives; I &s;peak of them as &s;ingle Per|&s;ons, and acting in their own per&s;onal and pri|vate Capacity, but when I &s;peak of Nations and Kingdoms, there the <HI>Devil</HI> is oblig'd to go on in the old Road, and act by Stratagem, by his proper Machinery, and to make u&s;e of all his Arts, and all his Agents, ju&s;t as he has done in all Ages, from the Beginning of his politic Government to this Day.</P>
<P>And if it was not thus too, what would become of all his numberle&s;s Legions, of which all Ages have heard &s;o much, and all Parts of the World have had &s;o much fatal Experience? They would &s;eem to be quite out of Employment, and be render'd u&s;ele&s;s in the World of Spirits, where it is to be &s;uppo&s;ed they re&s;ide; not the <HI>Devil</HI> him|&s;elf could find any Bu&s;ine&s;s for them, which by the Way, to bu&s;y and mi&s;chievous Spirits, as they are, would be a Hell to them, even before their Time; they would be, as it were, doom'd to a State of Inactivity, which we may &s;uppo&s;e was one Part of their Expul&s;ion from Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s and the Creation of Man; or as they were for the &s;urpri&s;ing Interval between the De&s;truction of
<PB N="397" REF="411">
Mankind by the Deluge and <HI>Noah</HI>'s coming out of the Ark, when indeed they might be &s;aid to have nothing at all to do.</P>
<P>But this is not Satan's Ca&s;e, and therefore let me tell you too, that you may not think I treat the Ca&s;e with more Levity than I really do, and than I am &s;ure I intend to do; tho' it is too true that our modern and modi&s;h Sinners have arri|ved to more exqui&s;ite Ways of being wicked, than their Fathers, and really &s;eem, as I have &s;aid, to need no <HI>Devil</HI> to tempt them; nay, that they do Satan's Work for him as to others al&s;o, and make them&s;elves <HI>Devils</HI> to their Neighbours, tempting others to Crime even fa&s;ter than the <HI>Devil</HI> de&s;ires them, running before they are &s;ent, and going of the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Errands gratis; by which Means Satan's Work is, as to them, done to his Hand, and they may be &s;aid to &s;ave him a great deal of Trouble; yet after all, the <HI>Devil</HI> has &s;till a great deal of Bu&s;ine&s;s upon his Hands, and as well him&s;elf as all his Legions, find them|&s;elves a full Employment in di&s;turbing the World, and oppo&s;ing the Glory and Kingdom of their great Superior, who&s;e Kingdom it is their whole Bu&s;ine&s;s, however vain in its End, to overthrow and de&s;troy, if they were able, or at lea&s;t to en|deavour it.</P>
<P>This being the Ca&s;e, it follows of cour&s;e that the general Mi&s;chiefs of Mankind, as well national and public, as family Mi&s;chiefs, and even per&s;onal, (except as before excepted) lie all &s;till at the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Door, as much as ever, let his Advocates bring him off of it if they can; and this brings us back again to the manner of the Devil's Management, and the Way of his working by human Agents, or if you will, the Way of human <HI>Devils,</HI> working in Affairs of low Life, &s;uch as we call Divina|tion, Sorcery, Black-Art, Necromancy, and the
<PB N="398" REF="412">
like; all which I take to con&s;i&s;t of two material Parts, and both very nece&s;&s;ary for us to be right|ly inform'd of.</P>
<P N="1">1. The Part which Satan by him&s;elf or his infe|rior <HI>Devils</HI> empowers &s;uch People to do, as he is in Confederacy with here on Earth; to whom he may be &s;aid, like the Ma&s;ter of an Opera or Comedy, to give their Parts to act, and to qualify them to act it; whether he obliges them to a Rehear&s;al in his Pre&s;ence, to try their Talents, and &s;ee that they are capable of performing, that indeed I have not enquir'd into.</P>
<P N="2">2. That Part which the&s;e empower'd People do voluntier or beyond their Commi&s;&s;ion, to &s;hew their Diligence in the Service of their new Ma&s;ter, and either (1.) to bring Gri&s;t to their own Mill, and make their Market of their Employment in the be&s;t manner they can; or (2.) to gain Applau&s;e, be admir'd, wonder'd at, and applauded, as if they were ten Times more <HI>Devils</HI> than really they are.</P>
<P>In a Word, the Matter con&s;i&s;ts of what the <HI>Devil</HI> does by the Help of the&s;e People, and what they do in his Name without him; the Devil is &s;ometimes cheated in his own Bu&s;ine&s;s; there are Pretenders to Witchcraft and Black-Art, who Satan never made any Bargain with, but who he connives at, becau&s;e at lea&s;t they do his Cau&s;e no harm, tho' their Bu&s;ine&s;s is rather to get Money, than to render him any Service, of which I gave you a remarkable In&s;tance before.</P>
<P>But to go back to his real Agents, of which I reckon two.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="399" REF="413">
1. Tho&s;e who act by Direction and Confede|racy, as I have &s;aid already many do.</P>
<P N="2">2. Tho&s;e whom he acts in and by, and they (per|haps) know it not, of which Sort Hi&s;tory give us Plenty of Examples, from <HI>Machia|vel</HI>'s fir&s;t Di&s;ciple&mdash;to the famous Car|dinal <HI>Alberoni,</HI> and even to &s;ome more mo|dern than his Eminence, of whom I can &s;ay no more till farther Occa&s;ion offers.</P>
<P N="1">1. Tho&s;e who act by immediate Direction of the Devil, and in Confederacy with him; the&s;e are &s;uch as I mention'd in the Beginning of this Chap|ter, who&s;e Arts are truly black, becau&s;e really infernal; it will be very hard to decide the Di&s;|pute between tho&s;e who really act thus in Con|federacy with the <HI>Devil,</HI> and tho&s;e who only pretend to it; &s;o I &s;hall leave that Di&s;pute where I find it; but that there are, or at lea&s;t have been, a Set of People in the World, who really are of his Acquaintance, and very intimate with him; and tho', as I have &s;aid, he has much alter'd his Schemes and chang'd Hands of late; yet that there are &s;uch People, perhaps of all Sorts; and that the <HI>Devil</HI> keeps up his Corre&s;pondence with them; I mu&s;t not venture to deny that Part, le&s;t I bring upon me the whole Po&s;&s;e of the con|juring and bewitching Crew, Male and Female, and they &s;hould mob me for pretending to deny them the Honour of dealing with the <HI>Devil,</HI> which they are &s;o exceeding willing to have the Fame of.</P>
<P>Not that I am hereby oblig'd to believe all the &s;trange Things the Witches and Wizards, who have been allow'd to be &s;uch, nay, who have been hang'd for it, have &s;aid of them&s;elves; nay, that they have confe&s;s'd of them&s;elves, even at the Gallows; and if I come to have an Occa&s;ion to

&s;peak freely of the matter, I may perhaps con|vince you that the Devil's po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing Power is much le&s;&s;en'd of late, and that he either is limi|ted, and his Fetter &s;horten'd more than it has been, or that he does not find the old Way, (as I &s;aid before) &s;o fit for his Purpo&s;e as he did for|merly, and therefore takes other Mea&s;ures, but I mu&s;t adjourn that to a Time and Place by it &s;elf: But we are told that there are another Sort of Peo|ple, and, perhaps, a great many of them too, in whom and by whom the <HI>Devil</HI> really acts, and they know it not.</P>
<P>It would take up a great deal of Time and Room, too much for this Place, &s;o near the Clo&s;e of this Work, to de&s;cribe and mark out the in|voluntary <HI>Devils</HI> which there are in the World; of whom it may be truly &s;aid, that really the <HI>Devil</HI> is in them, and they know it not: Now, tho' the <HI>Devil</HI> is cunning and managing, and can be very &s;ilent where he finds it for his In|tere&s;t not to be known; yet it is very hard for him to conceal him&s;elf, and to give &s;o little Di&s;|turbance in the Hou&s;e, as that the Family &s;hould not know who lodg'd in it; yet, I &s;ay, the <HI>De|vil</HI> is &s;o &s;ubtil and &s;o mi&s;chievous an Agent, that he u&s;es all manner of Methods and Craft to re&s;ide in &s;uch People as he finds for his Purpo&s;e, whe|ther they will or no, and which is more, whether they know it or no.</P>
<P>And let none of my Readers be angry or think them&s;elves ill u&s;ed, when I tell them the <HI>Devil</HI> may be in them, and may act them, and by them, and they not know it; for I mu&s;t add, it may, perhaps, be one of the greate&s;t Pieces of human Wi&s;dom in the World, for a Man to know when the <HI>Devil</HI> is in him, and when not; when he is a Tool and Agent of Hell, and when he is not; in a Word, when he is doing the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Work, and under his Direction, and when not.</P>

It is true, this is a very weighty Point, and might de&s;erve to be handled in a more &s;erious Way than I &s;eem to be talking in all this Book; but give me leave to talk of Things my own way, and withall, to tell you, that there is no Part of this Work &s;o &s;eemingly ludicrous, but a grave and well weigh'd Mind may make a &s;e|rious and &s;olid Application of it, if they plea&s;e; nor is there any Part of this Work, in which a clear &s;ight and a good Sen&s;e may not &s;ee that the Author's De&s;ign is, that they &s;hould do &s;o; and as I am now &s;o near the End of my Book, I thought it was meet to tell you &s;o, and lead you to it as far as I can.</P>
<P>I &s;ay, 'tis a great Part of human Wi&s;dom to know when the <HI>Devil</HI> is acting in us and by us, and when not; the next and &s;till greate&s;t Part would be to prevent him, put a Stop to his Progre&s;s, bid him go about his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and let him know he &s;hould carry on his De&s;igns no farther in that Manner; that we will be his Tools no longer; in &s;hort, to turn him out of Doors, and bring a &s;tronger Power to take Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; but this, indeed, is too &s;olid a Subject, and too great to begin with here.</P>
<P>But now, as to the bare knowing when he is at work with us, I &s;ay this, tho' it is con&s;iderable, may be done, nor is it &s;o very difficult; <HI>for Example,</HI> you have no more to do but look a little into the Microco&s;m of the Soul, and &s;ee there how the Pa&s;&s;ions which are the Blood, and the Affections which are the Spirit, move in their particular Ve&s;|&s;els; how they circulate, and in what Temper the Pul&s;e beats there, and you may ea&s;ily &s;ee who turns the Wheel; if a perfect calm po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the Soul; if Peace and Temper prevail, and the Mind feels no Tempe&s;ts ri&s;ing; if the Affections are regular and exalted to vertuous and &s;ublime Ob|jects,

<P>But on the other Hand, if at any time the Mind is ruffled, if Vapours ri&s;e, Clouds gather, if Pa&s;&s;ions &s;well the Brea&s;t, if Anger, Envy, Re|venge, Hatred, Wrath, Strife; if the&s;e, or any of the&s;e hover over you, much more if you feel them within you; if the Affections are po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, and the Soul hurried down the Stream to em|brace low and ba&s;e Objects; if tho&s;e Spirits, which are the Life and enlivening Powers of the Soul, are drawn off to Parties, and to be engag'd in a vicious and corrupt Manner, &s;hooting out wild and wicked De&s;ires, and running the Man headlong into Crime, the Ca&s;e is ea&s;ily re&s;olv'd, the Man is po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, the <HI>Devil</HI> is in him; and having taken the Fort, or at lea&s;t the Counter&s;carp and Out-Works, is making his Lodgment to cover and &s;ecure him&s;elf in his Hold, that he may not be di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd.</P>
<P>Nor can he be ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd when he has got &s;uch hold as this; and 'tis no wonder, that being lodg'd thus upon the Out-Works of the Soul he continues to &s;ap the Foundation of the re&s;t, and by his ince&s;&s;ant and furious A&s;&s;aults, reduces the Man at la&s;t to a Surrender.</P>
<P>If the Allegory be not as ju&s;t and appo&s;ite as you would have it be, you may, however, &s;ee by it in a full View, the State of the Man, and how the <HI>Devil</HI> carries on his De&s;igns; nothing is more common, and I believe there are few

<P>Let not any Man then, who is a Slave to his Pa&s;&s;ions, or who is chain'd down to his Cove|tou&s;ne&s;s, pretend to take it ill, when I &s;ay he has the <HI>Devil</HI> in him, or that he is a <HI>Devil:</HI> what el&s;e can it be, and how comes it to pa&s;s that Pa&s;&s;ion and Revenge &s;o often di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the Man of him&s;elf, as to lead him to commit Mur|ther, to lay Plots and Snares for the Life of his Enemies, and &s;o to thir&s;t for Blood? How comes this but by the Devil's putting tho&s;e Spirits of the Soul into &s;o violent a Ferment, into a Fever? that the Circulation is precipitated to that Degree, and that the Man too is precipitated into Mi&s;chief, and at la&s;t into Ruin; 'tis all the <HI>Devil,</HI> tho' the Man does not know it.</P>
<P>In like Manner Avarice leads him to rob, plun|der and de&s;troy for Money, and to commit &s;ome|times the wor&s;t of Violences to obtain the wick|ed Reward. How many have had their Throats cut for their Money, have been murther'd on the High-Way, or in their Beds, for the De&s;ire of what they had? It is the &s;ame Thing in other Articles, every Vice is the Devil in a Man; Lu&s;t of Rule is the <HI>Devil</HI> of great Men, and that Am|bition
<PB N="404" REF="418">
is their <HI>Devil</HI> as much as whoring is Fa|ther&mdash;'s <HI>Devil;</HI> one has a <HI>Devil</HI> of one Cla&s;s acting him, one another, and every Man's reigning Vice is a <HI>Devil</HI> to him.</P>
<P>Thus the <HI>Devil</HI> has his involuntary In&s;truments, as well as tho&s;e who act in Confederacy with him; he has a very great Share in many of us, and acts us, and in us, unknown to our &s;elves tho' we know nothing of it, and indeed tho' we may not &s;u&s;pect it of our&s;elves; like <HI>Hazael</HI> the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian,</HI> who when the Prophet told him how he would act the <HI>Devil</HI> upon the poor <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> an&s;wer'd with Dete&s;tation, <HI>is thy Servant a Dog that he &s;hould do this Thing,</HI> and yet he was that Dog, and did all tho&s;e cruel Things for all that; the <HI>Devil</HI> acting him, or acting in him, to make him wickeder than ever he thought it was po&s;&s;ible for him to be.</P>

<HEAD>THE CONCLUSION. <HI>Of the</HI> Devil<HI>'s la&s;t Scene of Liberty, and what may be &s;uppo&s;ed to be his End, with what we are to under&s;tand of his being tormented for ever and ever.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the <HI>Devil</HI> is a Prince of the Power of the Air, his Kingdom is mortal, and mu&s;t have an End; and as he is call'd the God of this World, that is, the great U&s;urper of the Homage and Reverence which Mankind ought of right to pay to their Maker, &s;o his U&s;urpation al&s;o, like the World it &s;elf, mu&s;t have an End: Satan is call'd the God of the World, as Men
<PB N="405" REF="419">
too much pro&s;trate and pro&s;titute them&s;elves to him, yet he is not the Governor of this World; and therefore the Homage and Wor&s;hip he has from the World is an U&s;urpation; and this will have an End, becau&s;e the World it &s;elf will have an End; and all Mankind, as they had a Begin|ing in Time, &s;o mu&s;t expire and be remov'd before the End of Time.</P>
<P>Since then the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Empire is to expire and come to an End, and that the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf and all his Ho&s;t of <HI>Devils</HI> are immortal Seraphs, Spirits that are not embodied and cannot die, but are to remain in Being; the Que&s;tion before us next will be, what is to become of him? what is his State to be? whether is he to wander, and in what Condition is he to remain to that Eternity to which he is &s;till to Exi&s;t?</P>
<P>I hope no Man will mi&s;take me &s;o much in what I have &s;aid as to Spirits, which are all Flame, not being affected with Fire, as if I &s;uppo&s;ed there was no Place of Puni&s;hment for the <HI>Devil,</HI> nor any Kind of Puni&s;hment that could affect them; and &s;o of our Spirits al&s;o when transform'd into Flame.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t be allow'd to &s;peak there of that mate|rial Fire, by which, as by an Allegory, all the Ter|rors of an eternal State are repre&s;ented to us in Scripture, and in the Writings of the learned Commentators, and by which the Pain of Sen&s;e is de&s;crib'd; this, perhaps, I do not under&s;tand as they &s;eem to do, and therefore have &s;aid,</P>
<P>When we're all Flame (that is all Spirit) we &s;hall all Fire (that is, all &s;uch Fire as this) de&s;pi&s;e. And thus I claim to be under&s;tood.</P>
<P>It does not follow from hence, neither do I &s;ugge&s;t, or &s;o much as think that infinite Power cannot form a &s;omething (tho' inconceivable to as here) which &s;hall be as tormenting, and as in|&s;upportable
<PB N="406" REF="420">
to a Devil, an apo&s;tate Seraph, and to a Spirit, tho' exalted, unembodied and ra|rified into <HI>Flame,</HI> as Fire would be to other Bo|dies; in which I think I am orthodox, and do not give the lea&s;t Occa&s;ion to an Enemy to charge me with prophane Speaking, in tho&s;e Words, or to plead for thinking prophanely him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>It mu&s;t be Athei&s;tical to the la&s;t Degree to &s;ug|ge&s;t, that whereas the <HI>Devil</HI> has been heaping up and ama&s;&s;ing Guilt ever &s;ince the Creation of Man, encrea&s;ing in hatred of God and Rebellion again&s;t him, and in all po&s;&s;ible endeavour to de|throne and depo&s;e the Maje&s;ty of Heaven, that yet Heaven had not prepar'd, or could not pre|pare a ju&s;t Penalty for him; and that it &s;hould not all end in God's entire Victory over Hell, and in Satan's open Condemnation: Heaven could not be ju&s;t to its own Glory, if he &s;hould not avenge him&s;elf upon this Rebel, for all his &s;uperlative Wickedne&s;s in his modern as well as antient Station; for the Blood of &s;o many millions of his faithful Subjects and Saints whom he has de&s;troy'd; and if nothing el&s;e offer'd it &s;elf to prove this Part, it would appear undoubt|ed to me; but this, I confe&s;s, does not belong to Satan's Hi&s;tory, and therefore I have re&s;erv'd it to this Place, and &s;hall al&s;o be the &s;horter in it.</P>
<P>That his Condition is to be a State of Puni&s;h|ment, and that by Torment, the <HI>Devil</HI> him&s;elf has own'd, and his calling out to our ble&s;&s;ed Lord when he ca&s;t him out of the furious Man among the Tombs, is a Proof of it, <HI>What have we to do with thee,</HI> and <HI>art thou come to torment us before the Time?</HI> Luke viii. 28. where the <HI>Devil</HI> acknow|ledges four Things, and three of them are direct|ly to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, and if you won't believe the Word of God, I hope you will believe the
<PB N="407" REF="421">
<HI>Devil,</HI> e&s;pecially when 'tis an open Confe&s;&s;ion again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P N="1">1. He confe&s;t Chri&s;t to be the <HI>Son of God</HI> (that by the Way) and <HI>no Thanks to him,</HI> for that does not want the <HI>Devil</HI>'s Evidence.</P>
<P N="2">2. He acknowledges he may be tormented.</P>
<P N="3">3. He acknowledges Chri&s;t was able to tor|ment him.</P>
<P N="4">4. He acknowledges that there is a Time ap|pointed when he &s;hall be tormented.</P>
<P>As to <HI>how,</HI> in <HI>what Manner,</HI> and by <HI>what Means,</HI> this tormenting the Devil is to be perform|ed or executed, that I take to be as needle&s;s to us as 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to know, and being not at pre&s;ent enclined to fill your Heads and Thoughts with weak and imperfect Gue&s;&s;es, I leave it where I find it.</P>
<P>It is enough to us that this Torment of the <HI>De|vil</HI> is repre&s;ented to us by Fire, it being impo&s;&s;ible for our confin'd Thoughts to conceive of Tor|ment by any Thing in the World more exqui&s;ite; whence I conclude, that <HI>Devils</HI> &s;hall at la&s;t receive a Puni&s;hment &s;uitable to their &s;pirituous Nature, and as exqui&s;itely Tormenting as a burning Fire would be to our Bodies.</P>
<P>Having thus &s;ettl'd my own Belief of this Matter, and &s;tated it &s;o, as I think will let you &s;ee 'tis rightly founded, the Matter &s;tands thus.</P>
<P>Satan having been let loo&s;e to play his Game in this World, has improv'd his Time to the ut|mo&s;t; he has not fail'd on all Occa&s;ions to exert his Hatred, Rage, and Malice at his Conqueror and Enemy, <HI>namely, his Maker;</HI> he has not fail'd from Principles of meer Envy and Pride, to pur&s;ue Mankind with all po&s;&s;ible Rancour, in order to de|prive him of the Honour and Felicity which he was created for, namely, to &s;ucceed the <HI>Devil</HI> and his Angels in the State of Glory from which they fell.</P>
<P><PB N="408" REF="422">
This Hatred of God and Envy at Man, having broken out in &s;o many &s;everal Ways in the whole Series of Time from the Creation, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;ari|ly have greatly encrea&s;ed his Guilt; and as Hea|ven is righteous to judge him, mu&s;t terminate in an encrea&s;e of Puni&s;hment, adequate to his Crime, and &s;ufficient to his Nature.</P>
<P>Some have &s;ugge&s;ted, that there is yet a Time to come, when the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hall exert more Rage, and do more Mi&s;chief than ever yet he has been permitted to do; whether he &s;hall break his Chain, o$ be unchain'd for a Time, they cannot tell, nor I neither; and 'tis happy for my Work, that even this Part too does not belong to his Hi&s;|tory; if ever it &s;hall be given an Account of by Mankind, it mu&s;t be a$ter it is come to pa&s;s, for my Part is not Prophe&s;y or foretelling what the <HI>Devil</HI> &s;hall do, but Hi&s;tory of what he has done.</P>
<P>Thus, good People, I have brought the Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Devil</HI> down to <HI>your own Times;</HI> I have, as it were, <HI>rais'd him</HI> for you, and &s;et him in your View, that you may know him and have a Care of him.</P>
<P>If any cunninger Men among you think they are able now to <HI>lay him</HI> again, and &s;o di&s;po&s;e of him out of your Sight, that you &s;hall be troubl'd no more with him, either here or hereafter, let them go to work with him their own Way; you know Things future do not belong to an Hi&s;to|rian, &s;o I leave him among you, wi&s;hing you may be able to give no wor&s;e an Account of him for the Time to come, than I have done for the Time pa&s;t.</P>
