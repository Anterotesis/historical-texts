<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne &s;ur mer, <DATE>June 23, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>YOU laid your commands upon me at
parting, to communicate from time
to time the ob&s;ervations I &s;hould
make in the cour&s;e of my travels, and it
was an injunction I received with plea&s;ure.
In gratifying your curio&s;ity, I &s;hall find &s;ome
amu&s;ement to beguile the tedious hours, which,
without &s;ome &s;uch employment, would be
rendered in&s;upportable by di&s;temper and di&s;|quiet.</P>
<P>You knew, and pitied my &s;ituation, tra|duced
by malice, per&s;ecuted by faction, aban|doned
by fal&s;e patrons, and overwhelmed by the
<PB N="2" REF="4">
&s;en&s;e of a dome&s;tic calamity, which it was
not in the power of fortune to repair.</P>
<P>You know with what eagerne&s;s I fled from
my country as a &s;cene of illiberal di&s;pute, and
incredible infatuation, where a few worthle&s;s
incendiaries had, by dint of perfidious calum|nies
and atrocious abu&s;e, kindled up a flame
which threatened all the horrors of civil di&s;|&s;en&s;ion.</P>
<P>I packed up my little family in a hired
coach, and attended by my tru&s;ty &s;ervant,
who had lived with me a dozen of years, and
now refu&s;ed to leave me, took the road to Do|ver,
in my way to the South of France, where
I hoped the mildne&s;s of the climate would
prove favourable to the weak &s;tate of my lungs.</P>
<P>You advi&s;ed me to have recour&s;e again to
the Bath waters, from the u&s;e of which I had
received great benefit the preceding winter:
but I had many inducements to leave Eng|land.
My wife earne&s;tly begged I would con|vey
her from a country where every object
&s;erved to nouri&s;h her grief: I was in hopes that
a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of new &s;cenes would engage her
attention, and gradually call off her mind from
a &s;eries of painful reflections; and I imagined
<PB N="3" REF="5">
the change of air, and a journey of near a
thou&s;and miles, would have a happy effect
upon my own con&s;titution. But, as the &s;um|mer
was already advanced, and the heat too
exce&s;&s;ive for travelling in warm climates, I
propo&s;ed &s;taying at Boulogne till the begin|ning
of autumn, and in the mean time to
bathe in the &s;ea, with a view to &s;trengthen
and prepare my body for the fatigues of &s;uch
a long journey.</P>
<P>A man who travels with a family of five
per&s;ons, mu&s;t lay his account with a number
of mortifications; and &s;ome of the&s;e I have
already happily overcome. Though I was
well acquainted with the road to Dover, and
made allowances accordingly, I could not help
being chagrined at the bad accommodation
and impudent impo&s;ition to which I was ex|po&s;ed.
The&s;e I found the more di&s;agreeable,
as we were detained a day extraordinary on
the road, in con&s;equence of my wife's be|ing
indi&s;po&s;ed.</P>
<P>I need not tell you this is the wor&s;t road in
England, with re&s;pect to the conveniencies of
travelling, and mu&s;t certainly impre&s;s foreign|ers
with an unfavourable opinion of the nation
<PB N="4" REF="6">
in general. The chambers are in general cold
and comfortle&s;s, the beds paultry, the cookery
execrable, the wine poi&s;on, the attendance
bad, the publicans in&s;olent, and the bills ex|tortion;
there is not a drop of tolerable malt
liquor to be had from London to Dover.</P>
<P>Every landlord and every waiter harangued
upon the knavery of a publican in Canter|bury,
who had charged the French amba&s;&s;ador
forty pounds for a &s;upper that was not worth
forty &s;hillings. They talked much of ho|ne&s;ty
and con&s;cience; but when they pro|duced
their own bills, they appeared to be
all of the &s;ame family and complexion. If
it was a reproach upon the Engli&s;h nation, that
an innkeeper &s;hould pillage &s;trangers at that
rate; it is a greater &s;candal, that the &s;ame fel|low
&s;hould be able to keep his hou&s;e &s;till o|pen.
I own, I think it would be for the ho|nour
of the kingdom to reform the abu&s;es of
this road; and in particular to improve the
avenue to London by the way of Kent-Street,
which is a mo&s;t di&s;graceful entrance to &s;uch
an opulent city. A foreigner, in pa&s;&s;ing
through this beggarly and ruinous &s;uburb,
conceives &s;uch an idea of mi&s;ery and mean|ne&s;s,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
as all the wealth and magnificence of
London and We&s;tmin&s;ter are afterwards un|able
to de&s;troy. A friend of mine, who brought
a Pari&s;ian from Dover in his own po&s;t-chai&s;e,
contrived to enter Southwark after it was dark,
that his friend might not perceive the naked|ne&s;s
of this quarter. The &s;tranger was much
plea&s;ed with the great number of &s;hops full of
merchandize, lighted up to the be&s;t advantage.
He was a&s;toni&s;hed at the di&s;play of riches in
Lombard-Street and Cheap&s;ide. The badne&s;s
of the pavement made him find the &s;treets twice
as long as they were. They alighted in Upper
Brook-Street by Gro&s;venor-Square; and when
his conductor told him they were then about
the middle of London, the Frenchman de|clared,
with marks of infinite &s;urprize, that
London was very near as long as Paris.</P>
<P>On my arrival at Dover I payed off my
coachman, who went away with a heavy heart.
He wanted much to cro&s;s the &s;ea, and endea|voured
to per&s;uade me to carry the coach and
hor&s;es to the other &s;ide. If I had been re|&s;olved
to &s;et out immediately for the South,
perhaps I &s;hould have taken his advice. If
I had retained him at the rate of twenty
<PB N="6" REF="8">
guineas per month, which was the price he
demanded, and begun my journey without
he&s;itation, I &s;hould travel more agreeably
than I can expect to do in the carriages of
this country; and the difference of the ex|pence
would be a meer trifle. I would ad|vi&s;e
every man who travels through France to
bring his own vehicle along with him, or at
lea&s;t to purcha&s;e one at Calais or Boulogne,
where &s;econd-hand berlins and chai&s;es may
be generally had at rea&s;onable rates. I have
been offered a very good berlin for thirty gui|neas:
but before I make the purcha&s;e, I mu&s;t
be better informed touching the different me|thods
of travelling in this country.</P>
<P>Dover is commonly termed a den of thieves;
and I am afraid it is not altogether without
rea&s;on, it has acquired this appellation. The
people are &s;aid to live by piracy in time of
war; and by &s;muggling and fleecing &s;trangers
in time of peace: but I will do them the
ju&s;tice to &s;ay, they make no di&s;tinction be|tween
foreigners and natives. Without all
doubt a man cannot be much wor&s;e lodged
and wor&s;e treated in any part of Europe;
nor will he in any other place meet with more
<PB N="7" REF="9">
flagrant in&s;tances of fraud, impo&s;ition, and
brutality. One would imagine they had form|ed
a general con&s;piracy again&s;t all tho&s;e who
either go to, or return from the continent.
About five years ago, in my pa&s;&s;age from
Flu&s;hing to Dover, the ma&s;ter of the packet-boat
brought to all of a &s;udden off the South
Foreland, although the wind was as favour|able
as it could blow. He was immediately
boarded by a cu&s;tom-hou&s;e boat, the officer
of which appeared to be his friend. He then
gave the pa&s;&s;engers to under&s;tand, that as it
was low water, the &s;hip could not go into
the harbour; but that the boat would carry
them a&s;hore with their baggage.</P>
<P>The cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officer demanded a gui|nea
for this &s;ervice, and the bargain was made.
Before we quitted the &s;hip, we were obliged
to gratify the cabin-boy for his attendance,
and to give drink-money to the &s;ailors. The
boat was run aground on the open beach;
but we could not get a&s;hore without the a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
of three or four fellows, who in&s;i&s;ted
upon being paid for their trouble. Every
parcel and bundle, as it was landed, was
&s;natched up by a &s;eparate porter: one ran
<PB N="8" REF="10">
away with a hat-box, another with a wig-box,
a third with a couple of &s;hirts tied up
in a handkerchief, and two were employed in
carrying a &s;mall portmanteau that did not
weigh forty pounds. All our things were
hurried to the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e to be &s;earched,
and the &s;earcher was paid for di&s;ordering our
cloaths: from thence they were removed to
the inn, where the porters demanded half a
crown each for their labour. It was in vain
to expo&s;tulate; they &s;urrounded the hou&s;e like
a pack of hungry hounds, and rai&s;ed &s;uch
a clamour, that we were fain to comply. Af|ter
we had undergone all this impo&s;ition, we
were vi&s;ited by the ma&s;ter of the packet, who,
having taken our fares, and wi&s;hed us joy of
our happy arrival in England, expre&s;&s;ed his
hope that we would remember the poor ma&s;|ter,
who&s;e wages were very &s;mall, and who
chiefly depended upon the genero&s;ity of the
pa&s;&s;engers. I own I was &s;hocked at his mean|ne&s;s,
and could not help telling him &s;o. I told
him, I could not conceive what title he had
to any &s;uch gratification: he had &s;ixteen pa&s;|&s;engers,
who paid a guinea each, on the
&s;uppo&s;ition that every per&s;on &s;hould have a
<PB N="9" REF="11">
bed; but there were no more than eight beds
in the cabin, and each of the&s;e was occupied
before I came on board; &s;o that if we had
been detained at &s;ea a whole week by con|trary
winds and bad weather, one half of the
pa&s;&s;engers mu&s;t have &s;lept upon the boards,
how&s;oever their health might have &s;uffered
from this want of accommodation. Not|with&s;tanding
this check, he was &s;o very ab|ject
and importunate, that we gave him a
crown a piece, and he retired.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t thing I did when I arrived at Do|ver
this la&s;t time, was to &s;end for the ma&s;ter
of a packet-boat, and agree with him to
carry us to Boulogne at once, by which means
I &s;aved the expence of travelling by land from
Calais to this la&s;t place, a journey of four-and-twenty
miles. The hire of a ve&s;&s;el from
Dover to Boulogne is preci&s;ely the &s;ame as
from Dover to Calais, five guineas; but this
&s;kipper demanded eight, and, as I did not
know the fare, I agreed to give him &s;ix.
We embarked between &s;ix and &s;even in the
evening, and found our&s;elves in a mo&s;t
wretched hovel, on board what is called a
Folk&s;tone cutter. The cabin was &s;o &s;mall
<PB N="10" REF="12">
that a dog could hardly turn in it, and the
beds put me in mind of the holes de&s;cribed
in &s;ome catacombs, in which the bodies of
the dead were depo&s;ited, being thru&s;t in with
the feet foremo&s;t; there was no getting into
them but end-ways, and indeed they &s;eemed
&s;o dirty, that nothing but extreme nece&s;&s;ity
could have obliged me to u&s;e them. We &s;at
up all night in a mo&s;t uncomfortable &s;ituati|on,
to&s;&s;ed about by the &s;ea, cold, and cramped
and weary, and langui&s;hing for want of &s;leep.
At three in the morning the ma&s;ter came
down, and told us we were ju&s;t off the har|bour
of Boulogne; but the wind blowing
off &s;hore, he could not po&s;&s;ibly enter, and
therefore advi&s;ed us to go a&s;hore in the
boat. I went upon deck to view the coa&s;t,
when he pointed to the place where he &s;aid
Boulogne &s;tood, declaring at the &s;ame time we
were within a &s;hort mile of the harbour's
mouth. The morning was cold and raw,
and I knew my&s;elf extremely &s;ubject to catch
cold; neverthele&s;s we were all &s;o impatient
to be a&s;hore, that I re&s;olved to take his advice.
The boat was already hoi&s;ted out, and we
went on board of it, after I had paid the
<PB N="11" REF="13">
captain and gratified his crew. We had &s;carce
parted from the &s;hip, when we perceived a
boat coming towards us from the &s;hore; and
the ma&s;ter gave us to under&s;tand, it was
coming to carry us into the harbour. When
I objected to the trouble of &s;hifting from one
boat to another in the open &s;ea, which (by
the bye) was a little rough; he &s;aid it was a
privilege which the watermen of Boulogne
had, to carry all pa&s;&s;engers a&s;hore, and that
this privilege he dur&s;t not venture to infringe.
This was no time nor place to remon&s;trate.
The French boat came along&s;ide half filled
with water, and we were handed from the
one to the other. We were then obliged to
lie upon our oars, till the captain's boat
went on board and returned from the &s;hip
with a packet of letters. We were after|wards
rowed a long league, in a rough &s;ea,
again&s;t wind and tide, before we reached the
harbour, where we landed, benumbed with
cold, and the women exce&s;&s;ively &s;ick: from
our landing-place we were obliged to walk ve|ry
near a mile to the inn where we purpo&s;ed
to lodge, attended by &s;ix or &s;even men and
women, bare-legged, carrying our baggage.
<PB N="12" REF="14">
This boat co&s;t me a guinea, be&s;ides paying
exorbitantly the people who carried our things;
&s;o that the inhabitants of Dover and of Bou|logne
&s;eem to be of the &s;ame kidney, and in|deed
they under&s;tand one another perfectly
well. It was our hone&s;t captain who made
the &s;ignal for the &s;hore-boat before I went
upon deck; by which means he not only gra|tified
his friends, the watermen of Boulogne,
but al&s;o &s;aved about fifteen &s;hillings portage,
which he mu&s;t have paid had he gone into
the harbour; and thus he found him&s;elf at
liberty to return to Dover, which he reached
in four hours. I mention the&s;e circum&s;tances
as a warning to other pa&s;&s;engers. When a
man hires a packet-boat from Dover to Ca|lais
or Boulogne, let him remember that the
&s;tated price is five guineas; and let him in|&s;i&s;t
upon being carried into the harbour in the
&s;hip, without paying the lea&s;t regard to the
repre&s;entations of the ma&s;ter, who is gene|rally
a little dirty knave. When he tells you
it is low water, or the wind is in your teeth,
you may &s;ay you will &s;tay on board till it is
high water, or till the wind comes favourable.
If he &s;ees you are re&s;olute, he will find means
<PB N="13" REF="15">
to bring his &s;hip into the harbour, or at
lea&s;t to convince you, without a po&s;&s;ibility of
your being deceived, that it is not in his
power. After all, the fellow him&s;elf was a lo&s;er
by his fine&s;&s;e; if he had gone into the har|bour,
he would have had another fare im|mediately
back to Dover, for there was a
Scotch gentleman at the inn waiting for &s;uch
an opportunity.</P>
<P>Knowing my own weak con&s;titution, I took
it for granted this morning's adventure would
co&s;t me a fit of illne&s;s; and what added to
my chagrin, when we arrived at the inn, all
the beds were occupied; &s;o that we were o|bliged
to &s;it in a cold kitchen above two hours,
until &s;ome of the lodgers &s;hould get up. This
was &s;uch a bad &s;pecimen of French accom|modation,
that my wife could not help re|gretting
even the inns of Roche&s;ter, Sitting|bourn,
and Canterbury: bad as they are, they
certainly have the advantage, when compared
with the execrable auberges of this country,
where one finds nothing but dirt and impo|&s;ition.
One would imagine the French were
&s;till at war with the Engli&s;h, for they pillage
them without mercy.</P>
<P><PB N="14" REF="16">
Among the &s;trangers at this inn where we
lodged, there was a gentleman of the faculty,
ju&s;t returned from Italy. Under&s;tanding that
I intended to winter in the South of France,
on account of a pulmonic di&s;order, he &s;trongly
recommended the climate of Nice in Pro|vence,
which, indeed, I had often heard ex|tolled;
and I am almo&s;t re&s;olved to go thither,
not only for the &s;ake of the air, but al&s;o for
its &s;ituation on the Mediterranean, where I
can have the benefit of bathing; and from
whence there is a &s;hort cut by &s;ea to Italy,
&s;hould I find it nece&s;&s;ary to try the air of
Naples.</P>
<P>After having been ill accommodated three
days at our inn, we have at la&s;t found com|modious
lodgings, by means of Mrs. B&mdash;, a
very agreeable French lady, to whom we were
recommended by her hu&s;band, who is my
countryman, and at pre&s;ent re&s;ident in Lon|don.
For three guineas a month we have the
greate&s;t part of a hou&s;e tolerably furni&s;hed;
four bed-chambers on the fir&s;t floor, a large
parlour below, a kitchen, and the u&s;e of a
cellar.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="17">
The&s;e, I own, are frivolous incidents, &s;carce
worth committing to paper; but they may
&s;erve to introduce ob&s;ervations of more con|&s;equence;
and in the mean time I know no|thing
will be indifferent to you, that concerns</P>
<CLOSER>Your humble &s;ervant.</CLOSER>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne &s;ur mer, <DATE>July 15, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE cu&s;tom-hou&s;e officers at Boulogne,
though as alert, are rather more civil
than tho&s;e on your &s;ide of the water. I brought
no plate along with me, but a dozen and a half
of &s;poons, and a dozen tea&s;poons: the fir&s;t
being found in one of our portmanteaus, when
they were examined at the bureau, co&s;t me
&s;eventeen livres <HI>entr&eacute;e:</HI> the others being luckily
in my &s;ervant's pocket, e&s;caped duty free. All
wrought &s;ilver imported into France, pays at
the rate of &s;o much per mark: therefore
tho&s;e who have any quantity of plate, will
do well to leave it behind them, unle&s;s they
<PB N="16" REF="18">
can confide in the dexterity of the &s;hip|ma&s;ters;
&s;ome of whom will undertake to
land it without the ceremony of examination.
The ordonnances of France are &s;o unfavour|able
to &s;trangers, that they oblige them to
pay at the rate of five per cent. for all the
bed and table linen which they bring into
the kingdom, even though it has been u&s;ed.
When my trunks arrived in a &s;hip from the
river Thames, I underwent this ordeal: but
what gives me more vexation, my books have
been &s;topped at the bureau; and will be &s;ent
to Amiens at my expence, to be examined by
the <HI>chambere &s;yndicale;</HI> le&s;t they &s;hould con|tain
&s;omething prejudicial to the &s;tate, or to
the religion of the country. This is a &s;pecies
of oppre&s;&s;ion which one would not expect
to meet with in France, which piques it&s;elf
on its politene&s;s and ho&s;pitality: but the
truth is, I know no country in which &s;tran|gers
are wor&s;e treated, with re&s;pect to their
e&s;&s;ential concerns. If a foreigner dies in
France, the king &s;eizes all his effects, even
though his heir &s;hould be upon the &s;pot; and
this tyranny is called the <HI>droit d'aubaine</HI>
founded at fir&s;t upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that
<PB N="17" REF="19">
all the e&s;tate of foreigners re&s;iding in France
was acquired in that kingdom, and that,
therefore, it would be unju&s;t to convey it
to another country. If an Engli&s;h prote&s;tant
goes to France for the benefit of his health,
attended by his wife or his &s;on, or both, and
dies with effects in the hou&s;e to the amount
of a thou&s;and guineas, the king &s;eizes the
whole, the family is left de&s;titute, and the
body of the decea&s;ed is denied chri&s;tian burial.
The Swi&s;s, by capitulation, are exempted
from this de&s;poti&s;m, and &s;o are the Scots, in
con&s;equence of an ancient alliance between
the two nations. The &s;ame <HI>droit d'aubaine</HI> is
exacted by &s;ome of the princes in Germany:
but it is a great di&s;couragement to commerce,
and prejudices every country where it is ex|erci&s;ed,
to ten times the value of what it
brings into the coffers of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>I am exceedingly mortified at the detention
of my books, which not only deprives me of
an amu&s;ement which I can very ill di&s;pen&s;e
with; but, in all probability, will expo&s;e me
to &s;undry other inconveniencies. I mu&s;t be
at the expence of &s;ending them &s;ixty miles
to be examined, and run the ri&s;que of their
<PB N="18" REF="20">
being condemned; and, in the mean time,
I may lo&s;e the opportunity of &s;ending them
with my heavy baggage by &s;ea to Bourdeaux,
to be &s;ent up the Garonne to Tholou&s;e, and
from thence tran&s;mitted through the canal
of Languedoc to Cette, which is a &s;ea-port on
the Mediterranean, about three or four leagues
from Montpelier.</P>
<P>For the recovery of my books, I had recour&s;e
to the advice of my landlord, Mon&s;. B&mdash;.
He is a hand&s;ome young fellow, about twenty-five
years of age, and keeps hou&s;e with two
maiden &s;i&s;ters, who are profe&s;&s;ed devotees.
The brother is a little libertine, good na|tured
and obliging; but a true Frenchman
in vanity, which is undoubtedly the ruling
pa&s;&s;ion of this volatile people. He has an
incon&s;iderable place under the government,
in con&s;equence of which he is permitted to
wear a &s;word, a privilege which he does not
fail to u&s;e. He is likewi&s;e receiver of the
tythes of the clergy in this di&s;trict, an office
that gives him a command of money, and he,
moreover, deals in the wine trade. When I
came to his hou&s;e, he made a parade of all
the&s;e advantages: he di&s;played his bags of
<PB N="19" REF="21">
money, and &s;ome old gold which his father
had left him. He de&s;cribed his chateau in
the country; dropped hints of the fortunes
that were &s;ettled upon mademoi&s;elles his &s;i&s;|ters;
boa&s;ted of his connexions at court; and
a&s;&s;ured me it was not for my money that he
let his lodgings, but altogether with a view
to enjoy the plea&s;ure of my company. The
truth, when &s;tript of all embelli&s;hments, is
this: the &s;ieur B&mdash;is the &s;on of an hone&s;t
bourgeois lately dead, who left him the hou&s;e,
with &s;ome &s;tock in trade, a little money, and
a paltry farm: his &s;i&s;ters have about three
thou&s;and livres (not quite 140 l.) a-piece;
the brother's places are worth about fifty
pounds a year, and his connexions at court
are confined to a commis or clerk in the
&s;ecretary's office, with whom he corre&s;ponds
by virtue of his employment. My landlord
piques him&s;elf upon his gallantry and &s;uc|ce&s;s
with the fair-&s;ex: he keeps a <HI>fille de joye,</HI>
and makes no &s;ecret of his amours. He
told mi&s;s C&mdash;the other day, in broken Eng|li&s;h,
that, in the cour&s;e of the la&s;t year, he
had made &s;ix ba&s;tards. He owned, at the &s;ame
time, he had &s;ent them all to the ho&s;pital;
<PB N="20" REF="22">
but, now his father is dead, he would him|&s;elf
take care of his future productions. This,
however, was no better than a ga&s;conade.&mdash;
Yesterday the hou&s;e was in a hot alarm, on
account of a new windfall of this kind: the
&s;i&s;ters were in tears; the brother was vi&s;ited
by the <HI>cur&eacute;</HI> of the pari&s;h; the lady in the
&s;traw (a &s;emp&s;tre&s;s) &s;ent him the bantling
in a ba&s;ket, and he tran&s;mitted it by the
carriers to the <HI>Enfans trouv&eacute;s</HI> at Paris.</P>
<P>But to return from this digre&s;&s;ion: Mr.
B&mdash;advi&s;ed me to &s;end a <HI>requ&eacute;te</HI> or petition
to the chancellor of France, that I might ob|tain
an order to have my books examined
on the &s;pot, by the pre&s;ident of Boulogne,
or the <HI>procureur du roy,</HI> or the subdelegate
of the intendance. He recommended an
<HI>avocat</HI> of his acquaintance to draw up the
<HI>memoire,</HI> and introduced him accordingly;
telling me at the &s;ame time, in private, that
if he was not a drunkard, he would be at the
head of his profe&s;&s;ion. He had indeed all
the outward &s;igns of a &s;ot; a &s;leepy eye, a
$ubicund face, and carbuncled no&s;e. He
&s;eemed to be a little out at elbows, had mar|vellous
foul linen, and his breeches were
<PB N="21" REF="23">
not very &s;ound: but he a&s;&s;umed an air of
importance, was very courteous, and very
&s;olemn. I a&s;ked him if he did not &s;ome|times
divert him&s;elf with the mu&s;e: he &s;miled,
and promi&s;ed, in a whi&s;per, to &s;hew me
&s;ome <HI>chansonettes de &s;a fa&ccedil;on.</HI> Meanwhile he
compo&s;ed the <HI>requete</HI> in my name, which was
very pompous, very tedious, and very abject.
Such a &s;tile might perhaps be nece&s;&s;ary in a
native of France; but I did not think it was
at all &s;uitable to a &s;ubject of Great-Britain.
I thanked him for the trouble he had taken,
as he would receive no other gratification;
but when my landlord propo&s;ed to &s;end the
<HI>memoire</HI> to his corre&s;pondent at Paris, to be
delivered to the chancellor, I told him I had
changed my mind, and would apply to the
Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador. I have accordingly taken
the liberty to addre&s;s my&s;elf to the earl of
H&mdash;; and at the &s;ame time I have pre&s;umed
to write to the duche&s;s of D&mdash;, who
is now at Paris, to entreat her grace's advice
and interpo&s;ition. What effect the&s;e appli|cations
may have, I know not: but the &s;ieur
B&mdash;&s;hakes his head, and has told my &s;er|vant,
in confidence, that I am mi&s;taken if I
<PB N="22" REF="24">
think the Engli&s;h amba&s;&s;ador is as great
man at Paris as the chancellor of France.</P>
<P>I ought to make an apology for troubling
you with &s;uch an unentertaining detail, and
con&s;ider that the detention of my books mu&s;t
be a matter of very little con&s;equence to any
body, but to</P>
<CLOSER>Your affectionate humble &s;ervant.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER III.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne, <DATE>August 15, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am much obliged to you for your kind
enquiries after my health, which has
been lately in a very declining condition.
In con&s;equence of a cold, caught a few days
after my arrival in France, I was &s;eized with
a violent cough, attended with a fe$er, and
&s;titches in my brea&s;t, which tormented me all
night long without cea&s;ing. At the &s;ame time
I had a great di&s;charge by expectoration, and
&s;uch a dejection of &s;pirits as I never felt be|fore.
In this &s;ituation I took a &s;tep which
<PB N="23" REF="25">
may appear to have been de&s;perate. I knew there
was no impo&s;thume in my lungs, and I &s;uppo&s;ed
the &s;titches were &s;pa&s;modical. I was &s;en&s;ible
that all my complaints were originally derived
from relaxation. I therefore hired a chai&s;e,
and going to the beach, about a league from
the town, plunged into the &s;ea without he&s;i|tation.
By this de&s;perate remedy, I got a
fre&s;h cold in my head: but my &s;titches and
fever vani&s;hed the very fir&s;t day; and by a
daily repetition of the bath, I have dimini&s;hed
my cough, &s;trengthened my body, and
recovered my &s;pirits. I believe I &s;hould have
tried the &s;ame experiment, even if there had
been an ab&s;ce&s;s in my lungs, though &s;uch
practice would have been contrary to all the
rules of medicine: but I am not one of
tho&s;e who implicity believe in all the dog|mata
of phy&s;ic. I &s;aw one of the guides at
Bath, the &s;toute&s;t fellow among them, who
recovered from the la&s;t &s;tage of a con&s;ump|tion,
by going into the king's bath, contrary
to the expre&s;s injunction of his doctor. He
&s;aid, if he mu&s;t die, the &s;ooner the better,
as he had nothing left for his &s;ub&s;i&s;tance.
In&s;tead of immediate death, he found in&s;tant
<PB N="24" REF="26">
ea&s;e, and continued mending every day, till
his health was entirely re-e&s;tabli&s;hed. I my|&s;elf
drank the waters at Bath, and bathed,
in diametrical oppo&s;ition to the opinion of
&s;ome phy&s;icians there &s;ettled, and found my&s;elf
better every day, notwith&s;tanding their un|favourable
progno&s;tic. If I had been of the
rigid fibre, full of blood, &s;ubject to inflam|mation,
I &s;hould have followed a different
cour&s;e. Our acquaintance, doctor C&mdash;,
while he actually &s;pit up matter, and rode
out every day for his life, led his hor&s;e to
water, at the pond in Hyde-Park, one cold
fro&s;ty morning, and the bea&s;t, which hap|pened
to be of a hot con&s;titution, plunged
him&s;elf and his ma&s;ter over head and ears in
the water. The poor doctor ha&s;tened home,
half dead with fear, and was put to bed in
the apprehen&s;ion of a new impo&s;thume; in|&s;tead
of which, he found him&s;elf exceedingly
recruited in his &s;pirits, and his appetite much
mended. I advi&s;ed him to take the hint,
and go into the cold bath every morning:
but he did not chu&s;e to run any ri&s;que. How
cold water comes to be &s;uch a bugbear, I know
not: if I am not mi&s;taken, Hippocrates re|commends
<PB N="25" REF="27">
immer&s;ion in cold water for the
gout; and Cel&s;us expre&s;sly &s;ays, <HI>in omni tu&s;&s;i
utilis e&s;t natatio.</HI></P>
<P>I have conver&s;ed with a phy&s;ician of this
place, a &s;en&s;ible man, who a&s;&s;ured me he was
reduced to meer &s;kin and bone by a cough
and hectic fever, when he ordered a bath to
be made in his own hou&s;e, and dipped him|&s;elf
in cold water every morning. He at the
&s;ame time left off drinking and &s;wallowing
any liquid that was warm. He is now &s;trong
and lu&s;ty, and even in winter has no other
cover than a &s;ingle &s;heet. His notions about
the warm drink were a little whim&s;ical: he
imagined it relaxed the tone of the &s;tomach;
and this would undoubtedly be the ca&s;e if it
was drank in large quantities, warmer than
the natural temperature of the blood. He
alledged the example of the inhabitants of
the Ladrone i&s;lands, who never ta&s;te any
thing that is not cold, and are remarkably
healthy. But to balance this argument I
mentioned the Chine&s;e, who &s;carce drink
any thing but warm tea; and the Lap|landers,
who drink nothing but warm water;
yet the people of both the&s;e nations
<PB N="26" REF="28">
are remarkably &s;trong, healthy, and long-lived.</P>
<P>You de&s;ire to know the fate of my books.
My lord H&mdash;d is not yet come to France;
but my letter was tran&s;mitted to him from
Paris; and his lord&s;hip, with that generous
humanity which is peculiar to his charac|ter,
has done me the honour to a&s;&s;ure me,
under his own hand, that he has directed
Mr. N&mdash;lle, our re&s;ident at Paris, to apply
for an order that my books may be re&s;tored.</P>
<P>I have met with another piece of good
fortune, in being introduced to general Pa|ter&s;on
and his lady, in their way to Eng|land
from Nice, where the general has been
many years commandant for the king of Sar|dinia.
You mu&s;t have heard of this gentle|man,
who has not only eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
him&s;elf, by his courage and conduct
as an officer; but al&s;o by his probity and
humanity in the exerci&s;e of his office, and
by his remarkable ho&s;pitality to all &s;trangers,
e&s;pecially the &s;ubjects of Great-Britain, who&s;e
occa&s;ions called them to the place where he
commanded. Being pretty far advanced in
years, he begged leave to re&s;ign, that he
<PB N="27" REF="29">
might &s;pend the evening of his days in his
own country; and his Sardinian maje&s;ty
granted his reque&s;t with regret, after having
honoured him with very particular marks of
approbation and e&s;teem. The general talks
&s;o favourably of the climate of Nice, with
re&s;pect to di&s;orders of the brea&s;t, that I am
now determined to go thither. It would
have been happy for me had he continued in
his government. I think my&s;elf &s;till very
fortunate, in having obtained of him a let|ter
of recommendation to the Engli&s;h con&s;ul
at Nice, together with directions how to tra|vel
through the South of France. I propo&s;e
to begin my journey &s;ome time next month,
when the weather will be temperate to the
&s;outhward; and in the wine countries I &s;hall
have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing the vintage, which
is always a &s;ea&s;on of fe&s;tivity among all ranks
of people.</P>
<P>You have been very much mi&s;-informed,
by the per&s;on who compared Boulogne to
Wapping: he did a manife&s;t inju&s;tice to this
place, which is a large agreeable town, with
broad open &s;treets, excellently paved; and
the hou&s;es are of &s;tone, well built and com|modious.
<PB N="28" REF="30">
The number of inhabitants may
amount to &s;ixteen thou&s;and. You know this
was generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be the <HI>portus Itius,</HI>
and <HI>Ge&s;&s;oriacum</HI> of the antients: though it
is now believed that the <HI>portus Itius,</HI> from
whence Cae&s;ar &s;ailed to Britain, is a place
called <HI>Whit&s;and,</HI> about half way between this
place and Calais. Boulogne is the capital of the
Boulonnois, a di&s;trict extending about twelve
leagues, ruled by a governor independent of
the governor of Picardy; of which province,
however, this country forms a part. The
pre&s;ent governor is the duc d'Aumont. The
town of Boulogne is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop &s;uf|fragan
of Rheims, who&s;e revenue amounts
to about four-and-twenty thou&s;and livres, or
one thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. It is al&s;o the
&s;eat of a &s;ene&s;chal's court, from whence an
appeal lies to the parliament of Paris; and
thither all condemned criminals are &s;ent, to
have their &s;entence confirmed or rever&s;ed.
Here is likewi&s;e a bailiwick, and a court of
admiralty. The military juri&s;diction of the
city belongs to a commandant appointed by
the king, a &s;ort of &s;inecure be&s;towed upon
&s;ome old officer. His appointments are very
<PB N="29" REF="31">
incon&s;iderable: he re&s;ides in the Upper Town,
and his garri&s;on at pre&s;ent con&s;i&s;ts of a few
hundreds of invalids.</P>
<P>Boulogne is divided into the Upper and
Lower Towns. The former is a kind of ci|tadel,
about a &s;hort mile in circumference,
&s;ituated on a ri&s;ing ground, &s;urrounded by a
high wall and rampart, planted with rows
of trees, which form a delightful walk. It
commands a fine view of the country and
Lower Town; and in clear weather the coa&s;t
of England, from Dover to Folk&s;tone, ap|pears
&s;o plain, that one would imagine it
was within four or five leagues of the French
&s;hore. The Upper Town was formerly for|tified
with outworks, which are now in ru|ins.
Here is a &s;quare, a town-hou&s;e, the
cathedral, and two or three convents of nuns;
in one of which there are &s;everal Engli&s;h
girls, &s;ent hither for their education. The
&s;mallne&s;s of the expence encourages parents
to &s;end their children abroad to the&s;e &s;emina|ries,
where they learn &s;carce any thing that
is u&s;eful, but the French language; but they
never fail to imbibe prejudices again&s;t the
prote&s;tant religion, and generally return en|thu&s;ia&s;tic
<PB N="30" REF="32">
converts to the religion of Rome.
This conver&s;ion always generates a contempt
for, and often an aver&s;ion to, their own
country. Indeed it cannot rea&s;onably be ex|pected,
that people of weak minds, addict|ed
to &s;uper&s;tition, &s;hould either love or e&s;teem
tho&s;e whom they are taught to con&s;ider as
reprobated heretics. Ten pounds a year is
the u&s;ual pen&s;ion in the&s;e convents; but I
have been informed by a French lady, who
had her education in one of them, that no|thing
can be more wretched than their en|tertainment.</P>
<P>The civil magi&s;tracy of Boulogne con&s;i&s;ts
of a mayor and echevins; and this is the
ca&s;e in almo&s;t all the towns of France.</P>
<P>The Lower Town is continued from the gate
of the Upper Town, down the &s;lope of a hill,
as far as the harbour, &s;tretching on both
&s;ides to a large extent, and is much more
con&s;iderable than the Upper, with re&s;pect to
the beauty of the &s;treets, the convenience of
the hou&s;es, and the number and wealth of
the inhabitants. The&s;e, however, are all
merchants, or bourgeois; for the noble&s;&s;e o$
gentry live all together in the Upper Town
<PB N="31" REF="33">
and never mix with the others. The har|bour
of Boulogne is at the mouth of the
&s;mall river, or rather rivulet Liane, which is
&s;o &s;hallow, that the children wade through
it at low water. As the tide makes, the &s;ea
flows in, and forms a pretty exten&s;ive har|bour,
which, however, admits nothing but
&s;mall ve&s;&s;els. It is contracted at the mouth by
two &s;tone <HI>jetties</HI> or piers, which &s;eem to have
been con&s;tructed by &s;ome engineer, very little
acquainted with this branch of his profe&s;&s;ion;
for they are carried out in &s;uch a manner, as
to collect a bank of &s;and ju&s;t at the entrance
of the harbour. The road is very open and
un&s;afe, and the &s;urf very high when the
wind blows from the &s;ea. There is no forti|fication
near the harbour, except a paltry fort
mounting about twenty guns, built in the
la&s;t war by the prince de Cruy, upon a rock
about a league to the ea&s;tward of Boulogne.
It appears to be &s;ituated in &s;uch a manner,
that it can neither offend, nor be offended.
If the depth of water would admit a forty
or fifty gun &s;hip to lie within cannon-&s;hot of
it, I apprehend it might be &s;ilenced in half
an hour; but, in all probability, there will
<PB N="32" REF="34">
be no ve&s;tiges of it at the next rupture be|tween
the two crowns. It is &s;urrounded every
day by the &s;ea, at high water; and when it
blows a fre&s;h gale towards the &s;hore, the waves
break over the top of it, to the terror and
a&s;toni&s;hment of the garri&s;on, who have been
often heard crying piteou&s;ly for a&s;&s;i&s;tance. I
am per&s;uaded, that it will one day di&s;appear
in the twinkling of an eye. The neighbour|hood
of this fort, which is a &s;mooth &s;andy
beach, I have cho&s;en for my bathing place.
The road to it is agreeable and romantic,
lying through plea&s;ant corn-fields, &s;kirted by
open downs, where there is a rabbit warren,
and great plenty of the birds &s;o much ad|mired
at Tunbridge under the name of <HI>wheat|ears.</HI>
By the bye, this is a plea&s;ant corrup|tion
of <HI>white-a&mdash;&s;e,</HI> the tran&s;lation of their
French name <HI>cul-blanc,</HI> taken from their co|lour;
for they are actually white towards
the tail.</P>
<P>Upon the top of a high rock, which over|looks
the harbour, are the remains of an old
fortification, which is indi&s;criminately called,
<HI>Tour d'ordre,</HI> and <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar's fort.</HI> The
original tower was a light-hou&s;e built by
<PB N="33" REF="35">
<HI>Claudius Cae&s;ar,</HI> denominated <HI>Turris ardens,</HI>
from the fire burned in it; and this the French
have corrupted into <HI>Tour d'ordre:</HI> but no ve&s;|tiges
of this Roman work remain; what we
now &s;ee, are the ruins of a ca&s;tle built by
Charlemagne. I know of no other anti|quity
at Boulogne, except an old vault in
the Upper Town, now u&s;ed as a magazine,
which is &s;aid to be part of an antient temple
dedicated to I&s;is.</P>
<P>On the other &s;ide of the harbour, oppo|&s;ite
to the Lower Town, there is a hou&s;e built,
at a con&s;iderable expence, by a general offi|cer,
who lo&s;t his life in the late war. Never
was &s;ituation more inconvenient, unplea&s;ant,
and unhealthy. It &s;tands on the edge of an
ugly mora&s;s formed by the &s;tagnant water
left by the tide in its retreat: the very walks
of the garden are &s;o moi&s;t, that, in the drie&s;t
weather, no per&s;on can make a tour of it,
without danger of the rheumati&s;m. Be&s;ides,
the hou&s;e is altogether inacce&s;&s;ible, except at
low water, and even then the carriage mu&s;t
cro&s;s the harbour, the wheels up to the axle-tree
in mud: nay, the tide ru&s;hes in &s;o fa&s;t,
that unle&s;s you &s;eize the time to a minute,
<PB N="34" REF="36">
you will be in danger of peri&s;hing. The
apartments of this hou&s;e are elegantly fitted
up, but very &s;mall; and the garden, not|with&s;tanding
its unfavourable &s;ituation, af|fords
a great quantity of good fruit. The
ooze, impregnated with &s;ea &s;alt, produces, on
this &s;ide of the harbour, an incredible quan|tity
of the fine&s;t <HI>&s;amphire</HI> I ever &s;aw. The
French call it <HI>pa&s;&s;-pierre;</HI> and I &s;u&s;pect its
Engli&s;h name is a corruption of <HI>&s;ang-pierre.</HI>
It is generally found on the faces of bare
rocks that overhang the &s;ea, by the &s;pray of
which it is nouri&s;hed. As it grew upon a
naked rock, without any appearance of &s;oil,
it might be naturally enough called <HI>&s;ang du
pierre,</HI> or <HI>&s;ang-pierre,</HI> blood of the rock;
and hence the name <HI>&s;amphire.</HI> On the &s;ame
&s;ide of the harbour there is another new hou&s;e,
neatly built, belonging to a gentleman who
has obtained a grant from the king of &s;ome
ground which was always overflowed at high
water. He has rai&s;ed dykes at a con&s;ider|able
expence, to exclude the tide, and if he
can bring his project to bear, he will not only
gain a good e&s;tate for him&s;elf, but al&s;o $word$
the harbour, by increa&s;ing the depth at
$igh-water.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="37">
In the Lower Town of Boulogne there are
&s;everal religious hou&s;es, particularly a &s;emi|nary,
a convent of Cordeliers, and another
of Capuchins. This la&s;t, having fallen to de|cay,
was &s;ome years ago repaired, chiefly by
the charity of Briti&s;h travellers, collected by
father Graeme, a native of North-Britain,
who had been an officer in the army of king
James II. and is &s;aid to have turned monk
of this mendicant order, by way of volun|tary
penance, for having killed his friend in
a duel. Be that as it may, he was a well-bred,
&s;en&s;ible man, of a very exemplary life and
conver&s;ation; and his memory is much re|vered
in this place. Being &s;uperior of the
convent, he cau&s;ed the Briti&s;h arms to be
put up in the church, as a mark of gratitude
for the benefactions received from our na|tion.
I often walk in the garden of the
convent, the walls of which are wa&s;hed by
the &s;ea at high-water. At the bottom of the
garden is a little private grove, &s;eparated from
it by a high wall, with a door of communica|tion;
and hither the Capuchins retire, when
they are di&s;po&s;ed for contemplation. About
two years ago, this place was &s;aid to be con|verted
<PB N="36" REF="38">
to a very different u&s;e. There was among
the monks one <HI>pere Charles,</HI> a lu&s;ty friar, of
whom the people tell &s;trange &s;tories. Some
young women of the town were &s;een mount|ing
over the wall, by a ladder of ropes, in
the du&s;k of the evening; and there was an
unu&s;ual crop of ba&s;tards that &s;ea&s;on. In
&s;hort, <HI>pere Charles</HI> and his companions gave
&s;uch &s;candal, that the whole fraternity was
changed; and now the ne&s;t is occupied by
another flight of the&s;e birds of pa&s;&s;age. If
one of our privateers had kidnapped a Ca|puchin
during the war, and exhibited him, in
his habit, as a &s;hew in London, he would
have proved a good prize to the captors; for
I know not a more uncouth and grote&s;que a|nimal,
than an old Capuchin in the habit of
his order. A friend of mine (a Swi&s;s offi|cer)
told me, that a pea&s;ant in his country
u&s;ed to weep bitterly, whenever a certain
Capuchin mounted the pulpit to hold forth to
the people. The good father took notice of
this man, and believed he was touched by the
finger of the Lord. He exhorted him to en|courage
the&s;e acce&s;&s;ions of grace, and at the
&s;ame time to be of good comfort, as having
<PB N="37" REF="39">
received &s;uch marks of the divine favour.
The man &s;till continued to weep, as before,
every time the monk preached; and at la&s;t
the Capuchin in&s;i&s;ted upon knowing what it
was, in his di&s;cour&s;e or appearance, that
made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his heart.&mdash;
&startq;Ah, father! (cried the pea&s;ant) I never
&s;ee you but I think of a venerable goat,
which I lo&s;t at Ea&s;ter. We were bred up to|gether
in the &s;ame family. He was the very
picture of your reverence&mdash;one would &s;wear
you were brothers. Poor <HI>Baudouin!</HI> he died
of a fall&mdash;re&s;t his &s;oul! I would willingly
pay for a couple of ma&s;&s;es to pray him out
of purgatory.&endq;</P>
<P>Among other public edifices at Boulogne,
there is an ho&s;pital, or workhou&s;e, which
&s;eems to be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon a very good foun|dation.
It maintains &s;everal hundreds of poor
people, who are kept con&s;tantly at work, ac|cording
to their age and abilities, in making
thread, all &s;orts of lace, a kind of catgut,
and in knitting &s;tockings. It is under the
direction of the bi&s;hop; and the &s;ee is at
pre&s;ent filled by a prelate of great piety and
benevolence, though a little inclining to bi|gotry
<PB N="38" REF="40">
and fanatici&s;m. The churches in this
town are but indifferently built, and poorly
ornamented. There is not one picture in
the place worth looking at, nor indeed does
there &s;eem to be the lea&s;t ta&s;te for the liberal
arts.</P>
<P>In my next, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;atisfy you
in the other articles you de&s;ire to know.
Mean-while, I am ever</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IV.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne, <DATE>September 1, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am infinitely obliged to D. H&mdash;for the
favourable manner in which he has men|tioned
me to the earl of H&mdash;. I have at la&s;t
recovered my books, by virtue of a particular
order to the director of the douane, procured
by the application of the Engli&s;h re&s;ident to
the French mini&s;try. I am now preparing
<PB N="39" REF="41">
for my long journey; but, before I leave
this place, I &s;hall &s;end you the packet I men|tioned,
by Meriton. Mean-while I mu&s;t
fulfil my promi&s;e in communicating the ob|&s;ervations
I have had occa&s;ion to make upon
this town and country.</P>
<P>The air of Boulogne is cold and moi&s;t, and, I
believe, of con&s;equence unhealthy. La&s;t win|ter
the fro&s;t, which continued &s;ix weeks in
London, la&s;ted here eight weeks without in|termi&s;&s;ion;
and the cold was &s;o inten&s;e, that,
in the garden of the Capuchins, it &s;plit the
bark of &s;everal elms from top to bottom. On
our arrival here we found all kinds of fruit
more backward than in England. The fro&s;t,
in its progre&s;s to Britain, is much weakened
in cro&s;&s;ing the &s;ea. The atmo&s;phere, impreg|nated
with &s;aline particles, re&s;i&s;ts the opera|tion
of freezing. Hence, in &s;evere winters,
all places near the &s;ea-&s;ide are le&s;s cold than
more inland di&s;tricts. This is the rea&s;on
why the winter is often more mild at Edin|burgh
than at London. A very great degree
of cold is required to freeze &s;alt water. In|deed
it will not freeze at all, until it has de|po&s;ited
all its &s;alt. It is now generally al|lowed
<PB N="40" REF="42">
among philo&s;ophers, that water is no
more than ice thawed by heat, either &s;olar,
or &s;ubterranean, or both; and that this heat
being expelled, it would return to its natu|ral
con&s;i&s;tence. This being the ca&s;e, nothing
el&s;e is required for the freezing of water, than
a certain degree of cold, which may be ge|nerated
by the help of &s;alt, or &s;pirit of nitre,
even under the line. I would propo&s;e, therefore,
that an apparatus of this &s;ort &s;hould be pro|vided
in every &s;hip that goes to &s;ea; and in
ca&s;e there &s;hould be a deficiency of fre&s;h
water on board, the &s;ea-water may be ren|dered
potable, by being fir&s;t converted into
ice.</P>
<P>The air of Boulogne is not only loaded with
a great evaporation from the &s;ea, increa&s;|ed
by &s;trong gales of wind from the We&s;t and
South-We&s;t, which blow almo&s;t continually
during the greate&s;t part of the year; but it
is al&s;o &s;ubject to putrid vapours, ari&s;ing from
the low mar&s;hy ground in the neighbourhood
of the harbour, which is every tide over-flowed
with &s;ea-water. This may be one cau&s;e
of the &s;crofula and rickets, which are two
prevailing di&s;orders among the children in
<PB N="41" REF="43">
Boulogne. But I believe the former is
more owing to the water u&s;ed in the Lower
Town, which is very hard and unwhol&s;ome.
It curdles with &s;oap, gives a red colour to the
meat that is boiled in it, and, when drank
by &s;trangers, never fails to occa&s;ion pains in
the &s;tomach and bowels; nay, &s;ometimes
produces dy&s;enteries. In all appearance it is
impregnated with nitre, if not with &s;ome|thing
more mi&s;chievous: we know that
mundi$, or pyrites, very often contains a
proportion of ar&s;enic, mixed with &s;ulphur,
vitriol, and mercury. Perhaps it partakes of
the acid of &s;ome coal mine; for there are coal
works in this di&s;trict. There is a well of
purging water within a quarter of a mile of
the Upper Town, to which the inhabitants
re&s;ort in the morning, as the people of Lon|don
go to the Dog-and-duck, in St. George's
fields. There is likewi&s;e a fountain of ex|cellent
water, hard by the cathedral, in the
Upper Town, from whence I am daily &s;up|plied
at a &s;mall expence. Some modern
chemi&s;ts affirm, that no &s;aline chalybeate wa|ters
can exi&s;t, except in the neighbourhood of
coal damps; and that nothing can be more
<PB N="42" REF="44">
mild, and gentle, and friendly to the con|&s;titution,
than the &s;aid damps: but I
know that the place where I was bred &s;tands
upon a zonic of coal; that the water which
the inhabitants generally u&s;e is hard and
bracki&s;h; and that the people are remarka|bly
&s;ubject to the king's evil and con&s;umpti|on.
The&s;e I would impute to the bad water,
impregnated with the vitriol and brine of coal,
as there is nothing in the con&s;titution of the
air that &s;hould render &s;uch di&s;tempers en|demial.
That the air of Boulogne encou|rages
putrefaction, appears from the effect
it has upon butcher's meat, which, though
the &s;ea&s;on is remarkably cold, we can hardly
keep four-and-twenty hours in the coole&s;t
part of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Living here is pretty rea&s;onable; and the
markets are tolerably &s;upplied. The beef is
neither fat nor firm; but very good for &s;oup,
which is the only u&s;e the French make of it.
The veal is not &s;o white, nor &s;o well fed, as
the Engli&s;h veal; but it is more juicy, and
better ta&s;ted. The mutton and pork are very
good. We buy our poultry alive, and fatten
them at home. Here are excellent turkies,
<PB N="43" REF="45">
and no want of game: the hares, in parti|cular,
are very large, juicy, and high-flavour|ed.
The be&s;t part of the fi&s;h caught on this
coa&s;t is &s;ent po&s;t to Paris, in cha&s;&s;e-marines,
by a company of contractors, like tho&s;e of
Ha&s;tings in Su&s;&s;ex. Neverthele&s;s, we have
excellent &s;oles, &s;kaite, flounders and whit|ings,
and &s;ometimes mackarel. The oy&s;ters
are very large, coar&s;e, and rank. There is
very little fi&s;h caught on the French coa&s;t,
becau&s;e the &s;hallows run a great way from
the &s;hore; and the fi&s;h live chiefly in deep
water: for this rea&s;on the fi&s;hermen go a
great way out to &s;ea, &s;ometimes even as far as
the coa&s;t of England. Notwith&s;tanding all the
ha&s;te the contractors can make, their fi&s;h in the
&s;ummer is very often &s;poiled before it arrives
at Paris; and this is not to be wondered at,
con&s;idering the length of the way, which is
near one hundred and fity miles. At be&s;t it
mu&s;t be in &s;uch a mortified condition, that
no other people, except the negroes on the
coa&s;t of Guinea, would feed upon it.</P>
<P>The wine commonly drank at Boulogne
comes from Auxerre, is very &s;mall and mea|gre,
and may be had from five to eight &s;ols a
<PB N="44" REF="46">
bottle; that is, from two-pence halfpenny to
four-pence. The French inhabitants drink
no good wine; nor is there any to be had,
unle&s;s you have recour&s;e to the Briti&s;h wine-merchants
here e&s;tabli&s;hed, who deal in Bour|deaux
wines, brought hither by &s;ea for the
London market. I have very good claret
from a friend, at the rate of fifteen-pence
&s;terling a bottle; and excellent &s;mall beer as
rea&s;onable as in England. I don't believe there
is a drop of generous Burgundy in the place;
and the aubergi&s;tes impo&s;e upon us &s;hameful|ly,
when they charge it at two livres a bot|tle.
There is a &s;mall white wine, called <HI>pre|niac,</HI>
which is very agreeable and very cheap.
All the brandy which I have &s;een in Boulogne
is new, fiery, and &s;till-burnt. This is the tra&s;h
which the &s;mugglers import into England:
they have it for about ten-pence a gallon.
Butchers meat is &s;old for five &s;ols, or two-pence
halfpenny a pound, and the pound here
con&s;i&s;ts of eighteen ounces. I have a young tur|key
for thirty &s;ols; a hare for four-and-twenty;
a couple of chickens for twenty &s;ols, and a
couple of good &s;oles for the &s;ame price. Be|fore
we left England, we were told that there
<PB N="45" REF="47">
was no fruit in Boulogne; but we have
found our&s;elves agreeably di&s;appointed in
this particular. The place is well &s;upplied
with &s;trawberries, cherries, goo&s;eberries, co|rinths,
peaches, apricots, and excellent pears.
I have eaten more fruit this &s;ea&s;on, than I
have done for &s;everal years. There are ma|ny
well-cultivated gardens in the &s;kirts of the
town; particularly one belonging to our friend
Mrs. B&mdash;, where we often drink tea in a
charming &s;ummer-hou&s;e built on a ri&s;ing
ground, which commands a delightful pro&s;pect
of the &s;ea. We have many obligations
to this good lady, who is a kind neighbour,
an obliging friend, and a mo&s;t agreeable com|panion:
&s;he &s;peaks Engli&s;h prettily, and is
greatly attached to the people and the cu&s;toms
of our nation. They u&s;e wood for their
common fewel, though, if I were to live at
Boulogne, I would mix it with coal, which
this country affords. Both the wood and the
coal are rea&s;onable enough. I am certain that
a man may keep hou&s;e in Boulogne for about
one half of what it will co&s;t him in Lon|don;
and this is &s;aid to be one of the deare&s;t
places in France.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="48">
The adjacent country is very agreeable,
diver&s;ified with hill and dale, corn-fields,
woods, and meadows. There is a fore&s;t of a
con&s;iderable extent, that begins about a &s;hort
league from the Upper Town: it belongs to
the king, and the wood is farmed to diffe|rent
individuals.</P>
<P>In point of agriculture, the people in this
neighbourhood &s;eem to have profited by the
example of the Engli&s;h. Since I was la&s;t in
France, fifteen years ago, a good number of
inclo&s;ures and plantations have been made in
the Engli&s;h fa&s;hion. There is a good many
tolerable country-hou&s;es, within a few miles
of Boulogne; but mo&s;tly empty. I was of|fered
a compleat hou&s;e, with a garden of
four acres well laid out, and two fields for
gra&s;s or hay, about a mile from the town,
for four hundred livres, about &s;eventeen pounds
a year: it is partly furni&s;hed, &s;tands in an
agreeable &s;ituation, with a fine pro&s;pect of
the &s;ea, and was lately occupied by a Scotch
nobleman, who is in the &s;ervice of France.</P>
<P>To judge from appearance, the people of
Boulogne are de&s;cended from the Flemings,
who formerly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed this country; for, a
<PB N="47" REF="49">
great many of the pre&s;ent inhabitants have
fine &s;kins, fair hair, and florid complexions;
very different from the natives of France in
general, who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by black hair,
brown &s;kins, and &s;warthy faces. The people
of the Boulonnois enjoy &s;ome extraordinary
privileges, and, in particular, are exempted
from the gabelle or duties upon &s;alt: how
they de&s;erved this mark of favour, I do not
know; but they &s;eem to have a &s;pirit of in|dependence
among them, are very ferocious,
and much addicted to revenge. Many bar|barous
murders are committed, both in the
town and country; and the pea&s;ants, from
motives of envy and re&s;entment, frequently
&s;et their neighbours hou&s;es on fire. Several
in&s;tances of this kind have happened in the
cour&s;e of the la&s;t year. The interruption
which is given, in arbitrary governments, to
the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, by the interpo|&s;ition
of the great, has always a bad effect
upon the morals of the common people. The
pea&s;ants too are often rendered de&s;perate and
&s;avage, by the mi&s;ery they &s;uffer from the
oppre&s;&s;ion and tyranny of their landlords.
In this neighbourhood the labouring people
<PB N="48" REF="50">
are ill lodged and wretchedly fed; and they
have no idea of cleanline&s;s. There is a &s;ub|&s;tantial
burgher in the High Town, who was
&s;ome years ago convicted of a mo&s;t barba|rous
murder. He received &s;entence to be
broke alive upon the wheel; but was par|doned
by the interpo&s;ition of the governor
of the county, and carries on his bu&s;ine&s;s
as u&s;ual in the face of the whole commu|nity.
A furious <HI>abb&eacute;,</HI> being refu&s;ed orders
by the bi&s;hop, on account of his irregular
life, took an opportunity to &s;tab the prelate
with a knife, one Sunday, as he walked out
of the cathedral. The good bi&s;hop de&s;ired
he might be permitted to e&s;cape; but it was
thought proper to puni&s;h, with the utmo&s;t
&s;everity, &s;uch an atrocious attempt. He was
accordingly apprehended, and, though, the
wound was not mortal, condemned to be
broke. When this dreadful &s;entence was ex|ecuted,
he cried out, that it was hard he
&s;hould undergo &s;uch torments, for having
wounded a worthle&s;s prie&s;t, by whom he had
been injured, while &s;uch-a-one (naming the
burgher mentioned above) lived in ea&s;e and
&s;ecurity, after having brutally murdered a poor
<PB N="49" REF="51">
man, and a helple&s;s woman big with child,
who had not given him the lea&s;t provoca|tion.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Boulogne may be di|vided
into three cla&s;&s;es; the noble&s;&s;e or gen|try,
the burghers, and the canaille. I don't
mention the clergy, and the people belonging
to the law, becau&s;e I &s;hall occa&s;ionally trou|ble
you with my thoughts upon the religion
and eccle&s;ia&s;tics of this country; and as for
the lawyers, exclu&s;ive of their profe&s;&s;ion, they
may be con&s;idered as belonging to one or o|ther
of the&s;e divi&s;ions. The noble&s;&s;e are
vain, proud, poor, and &s;lothful. Very few
of them have above &s;ix thou&s;and livres a year,
which may amount to about two hundred
and fifty pounds &s;terling; and many of them
have not half this revenue. I think there is
one heire&s;s, &s;aid to be worth one hundred
thou&s;and livres, about four thou&s;and two
hundred pounds; but then her jewels, her
cloaths, and even her linen, are reckoned part
of this fortune. The noble&s;&s;e have not the
common &s;en&s;e to re&s;ide at their hou&s;es in the
country, where, by farming their own grounds,
they might live at a &s;mall expence, and im|prove
<PB N="50" REF="52">
their e&s;tates at the &s;ame time. They
allow their country-hou&s;es to go to decay,
and their gardens and fields to wa&s;te; and re|&s;ide
in dark holes in the Upper Town of Bou|logne,
without light, air, or convenience.
There they &s;tarve within doors, that they
may have wherewithal to purcha&s;e fine cloaths,
and appear dre&s;&s;ed once a day in the church,
or on the rampart. They have no education,
no ta&s;te for reading, no hou&s;ewifery, nor in|deed
any earthly occupation, but that of dre&s;|&s;ing
their hair, and adorning their bodies.
They hate walking, and would never go a|broad,
if they were not &s;timulated by the va|nity
of being &s;een. I ought to except indeed
tho&s;e who turn devotees, and &s;pend the great|e&s;t
part of their time with the prie&s;t, either
at church, or in their own hou&s;es. Other
amu&s;ements they have none in this place, ex|cept
private parties of card-playing, which
are far from being expen&s;ive. Nothing can
be more par&s;imonious than the oeconomy of
the&s;e people: they live upon &s;oupe and bou|ill$,
fi&s;h and &s;allad: they never think of giv|ing
dinners, or entertaining their friends;
they even &s;ave the expence of coffee and tea,
<PB N="51" REF="53">
though both are very cheap at Boulogne. They
pre&s;ume that every per&s;on drinks coffee at
home, immediately after dinner, which is
always over by one o'clock; and, in lieu of
tea in the afternoon, they treat with a gla&s;s
of &s;herbet, or capillaire. In a word, I know
not a more in&s;ignificant &s;et of mortals than
the noble&s;&s;e of Boulogne; helple&s;s in them|&s;elves,
and u&s;ele&s;s to the community; with|out
dignity, &s;en&s;e, or &s;entiment; contempti|ble
from pride, and ridiculous from vanity,
They pretend to be jealous of their rank,
and will entertain no corre&s;pondence with
the merchants, whom they term plebeians.
They likewi&s;e keep at a great di&s;tance from
&s;trangers, on pretence of a delicacy in the
article of punctilio: but, as I am informed,
this &s;tateliene&s;s is in a great mea&s;ure affected,
in order to conceal their poverty, which would
appear to greater di&s;advantage, if they ad|mitted
of a more familiar communication.
Con&s;idering the vivacity of the French peo|ple,
one would imagine they could not po&s;|&s;ibly
lead &s;uch an im&s;ipid life, altogether un|animated
by &s;ociety, or diver&s;ion. True it
is, the only profane diver&s;ions of this place
<PB N="52" REF="54">
are a puppet-&s;how and a mountebank; but
then their religion affords a perpetual come|dy.
Their high ma&s;&s;es, their fea&s;ts, their
proce&s;&s;ions, their pilgrimages, confe&s;&s;ions,
images, tapers, robes, incen&s;e, benedictions,
&s;pectacles, repre&s;entations, and innumerable
ceremonies, which revolve almo&s;t ince&s;&s;antly,
furni&s;h a variety of entertainment from one
end of the year to the other. If &s;uper&s;tition
implies <HI>fear,</HI> never was a word more mi&s;ap|plied
than it is to the mummery of the re|ligion
of Rome. The people are &s;o far from
being impre&s;&s;ed with awe and religious terror
by this &s;ort of machinery, that it amu&s;es their
imaginations in the mo&s;t agreeable manner,
and keeps them always in good humour.
A Roman catholic longs as impatiently for the
fe&s;tival of <HI>St. Suaire,</HI> or <HI>St. Croix,</HI> or <HI>St. Ve|ronique,</HI>
as a &s;chool-boy in England for the
repre&s;entation of punch and the devil; and
there is generally as much laughing at one
farce as at the other. Even when the de&s;cent
from the cro&s;s is acted, in the holy week, with
all the circum&s;tances that ought naturally to
in&s;pire the grave&s;t &s;entiments, if you ca&s;t your
eyes among the multitude that croud the
<PB N="53" REF="55">
place, you will not di&s;cover one melancholy
face: all is prattling, tittering, or laughing;
and ten to one but you perceive a number of
them employed in hi&s;&s;ing the female who
per&s;onates the Virgin Mary. And here it
may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that the Ro|man
catholics, not content with the infinite
number of &s;aints who really exi&s;ted, have
not only per&s;onified <HI>the cro&s;s,</HI> but made two
female &s;aints out of a piece of linen. <HI>Ve|ronique,</HI>
or <HI>Veronica,</HI> is no other than a cor|ruption
of <HI>vera icon,</HI> or <HI>vera effigies,</HI> &s;aid to
be the exact repre&s;entation of our Saviour's
face, impre&s;&s;ed upon a piece of linen, with
which he wiped the &s;weat from his forehead
in his way to the place of crucifixion. The
&s;ame is wor&s;hipped under the name of St.
<HI>Suaire,</HI> from the Latin word <HI>&s;udarium.</HI> This
&s;ame handkerchief is &s;aid to have had three
folds, on every one of which was the impre&s;&s;ion:
one of the&s;e remains at Jeru&s;alem, a &s;econd
was brought to Rome, and a third was con|veyed
to Spain. Baronius &s;ays, there is a very
antient hi&s;tory of the <HI>&s;ancta facies</HI> in the Va|tican.
Tillemont, however, looks upon the
whole as a fable. Some &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Veronica</HI> to
<PB N="54" REF="56">
be the &s;ame with St. Haemorrhoi&s;&s;a, the pa|trone&s;s
of tho&s;e who are afflicted with the piles,
who make their joint invocations to her and St.
Fiacre, the &s;on of a Scotch king, who lived and
died a hermit in France. The troops of Henry V.
of England are &s;aid to have pillaged the cha|pel
of this Highland &s;aint; who, in revenge,
a&s;&s;i&s;ted his countrymen, in the French &s;er|vice,
to defeat the Engli&s;h at Baug&eacute;, and af|terwards
afflicted Henry with the piles, of
which he died. This prince complained, that
he was not only plagued by the living Scots,
but even per&s;ecuted by tho&s;e who were dead.</P>
<P>I know not whether I may be allowed to
compare the Romi&s;h religion to comedy, and
Calvini&s;m to tragedy. The fir&s;t amu&s;es the
&s;en&s;es, and excites ideas of mirth and good-humour;
the other, like tragedy, deals in
the pa&s;&s;ions of terror and pity. Step into a
conventicle of di&s;&s;enters, you will, ten to
one, hear the mini&s;ter holding forth upon
the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, or the torments of
hell, and &s;ee many marks of religious hor|ror
in the faces of the hearers. This is per|haps
one rea&s;on why the reformation did not
&s;ucceed in France, among a volatile, giddy,
<PB N="55" REF="57">
unthinking people, &s;hocked at the mortified
appearances of the Calvini&s;ts; and accounts
for its rapid progre&s;s among nations of a
more melancholy turn of character and com|plexion:
for, in the conver&s;ion of the mul|titude,
rea&s;on is generally out of the que&s;ti|on.
Even the penance impo&s;ed upon the
catholics is little more than mock mortifica|tion:
a murderer is often quit with his con|fe&s;&s;or
for &s;aying three prayers extraordinary;
and the&s;e ea&s;y terms, on which ab&s;olution is
obtained, certainly encourage the repetition
of the mo&s;t enormous crimes. The pomp
and ceremonies of this religion, together with
the great number of holidays they ob&s;erve,
how&s;oever they may keep up the &s;pirits of
the commonalty, and help to dimini&s;h the
&s;en&s;e of their own mi&s;ery, mu&s;t certainly, at
the &s;ame time, produce a frivolous ta&s;te for
frippery and &s;hew, and encourage a habit of
idlene&s;s, to which I, in a great mea&s;ure,
a&s;cribe the extreme poverty of the lower
people. Very near half of their time,
which might be profitably employed in the
exerci&s;e of indu&s;try, is lo&s;t to them&s;elves
and the community, in attendance upon
<PB N="56" REF="58">
the different exhibitions of religious mum|mery.</P>
<P>But as this letter has already run to an
uncon&s;cionable length, I &s;hall defer, till ano|ther
occa&s;ion, what I have further to &s;ay on
the people of this place, and in the mean

<OPENER><DATELINE>Boulogne, <DATE>September 12, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>MY &s;tay in this place now draws to|wards
a period. 'Till within the&s;e
few days I have continued bathing, with &s;ome
advantage to my health, though the &s;ea&s;on
has been cold and wet, and di&s;agreeable.
There was a fine pro&s;pect of a plentiful har|ve&s;t
in this neighbourhood. I u&s;ed to have
great plea&s;ure in driving between the fields of
wheat, oats, and barley; but the crop has
been entirely ruined by the rain, and nothing
is now to be &s;een on the ground but the
<PB N="57" REF="59">
tarni&s;hed &s;traw, and the rotten &s;poils of the
hu&s;bandman's labour. The ground &s;carce
affords &s;ub&s;i&s;tence to a few flocks of meagre
&s;heep, that crop the &s;tubble, and the inter|vening
gra&s;s; each flock under the pro|tection
of its &s;hepherd, with his crook
and dogs, who lies every night in the mid&s;t
of the fold, in a little thatched travelling
lodge, mounted on a wheel-carriage. Here
he pa&s;&s;es the night, in order to defend his
flock from the wolves, which are &s;ometimes,
e&s;pecially in winter, very bold and de&s;pe|rate.</P>
<P>Two days ago we made an excur&s;ion with
Mrs. B&mdash;and Capt. L&mdash;to the village of
Samers, on the Paris road, about three leagues
from Boulogne. Here is a venerable abbey
of Benedictines, well endowed, with large
agreeable gardens prettily laid out. The monks
are well lodged, and well entertained. Tho'
re&s;tricted from fle&s;h meals by the rules of
their order, they are allowed to eat wild duck
and teal, as a &s;pecies of fi&s;h; and when they
long for a good <HI>bouillon,</HI> or a partridge, or
pullet, they have nothing to do but to &s;ay
they are out of order. In that ca&s;e the appe|tite
<PB N="58" REF="60">
of the patient is indulged in his own a|partment.
Their church is elegantly con|trived,
but kept in a very dirty condition.
The greate&s;t curio&s;ity I &s;aw in this place was
an Engli&s;h boy, about eight or nine years old,
from Dover, whom his father had &s;ent hither
to learn the French language. In le&s;s than
eight weeks, he was become captain of the
boys of the place, &s;poke French perfectly
well, and had almo&s;t forgot his mother
tongue. But to return to the people of Bou|logne.</P>
<P>The burghers here, as in other places, con|&s;i&s;t
of merchants, &s;hop-keepers, and arti&s;ans.
Some of the merchants have got fortunes, by
fitting out privateers during the war. A
great many &s;ingle &s;hips were taken from the
Engli&s;h, notwith&s;tanding the good look-out
of our crui&s;ers, who were &s;o alert, that the
privateers from this coa&s;t were often taken
in four hours after they &s;ailed from the French
harbour; and there is hardly a captain of
an <HI>armateur</HI> in Boulogne, who has not been
pri&s;oner in England five or &s;ix times in the
cour&s;e of the war. They were fitted out at
a very &s;mall expence, and u&s;ed to run over
<PB N="59" REF="61">
in the night to the coa&s;t of England, where
they hovered as Engli&s;h fi&s;hing &s;macks, until
they kidnapped some coaster, with which they
made the be&s;t of their way acro&s;s the Chan|nel.
If they fell in with a Briti&s;h cruizer,
they &s;urrendered without re&s;i&s;tance: the cap|tain
was &s;oon exchanged, and the lo&s;s of the
proprietor was not great: if they brought
their prize &s;afe into harbour, the advan|tage
was con&s;iderable. In time of peace the
merchants of Boulogne deal in wine, bran|dies,
and oil, imported from the South, and
export fi&s;h, with the manufactures of France,
to Portugal, and other countries; but the
trade is not great. Here are two or three
considerable hou&s;es of wine merchants from
Britain, who deal in Bourdeaux wine, with
which they supply London and other parts of
England, Scotland, and Ireland. The fi&s;hery
of mackarel and herring is so con&s;iderable on
this coast, that it is &s;aid to yield annually eight
or nine hundred thou&s;and livres, about thir|ty-five
thousand pounds sterling.</P>
<P>The &s;hop-keepers here drive a considerable
traffic with the Engli&s;h &s;mugglers, who&s;e cutters
are almo&s;t the only ve&s;&s;els one &s;ees in the har|bour
<PB N="60" REF="62">
of Boulogne, if we except about a do|zen
of tho&s;e flat-bottomed boats, which rai&s;ed
&s;uch alarms in England, in the cour&s;e of the
war. Indeed they &s;eem to be good for no|thing
el&s;e, and perhaps they were built for this
purpo&s;e only. The &s;mugglers from the coa&s;t
of Kent and Su&s;&s;ex pay Engli&s;h gold for great
quantities of French brandy, tea, coffee, and
&s;mall wine, which they run from this coun|try.
They likewi&s;e buy gla&s;s trinkets, toys,
and coloured prints, which &s;ell in England,
for no other rea&s;on, but that they come from
France, as they may be had as cheap, and
much better fini&s;hed, of our own manufacture.
They likewi&s;e take off ribbons, laces, linen,
and cambrics; though this branch of trade
is chiefly in the hands of traders that come
from London, and make their purcha&s;es at
Dunkirk, where they pay no duties. It is
certainly worth while for any traveller to lay
in a &s;tock of linen either at Dunkirk or Bou|logne;
the difference of the price at the&s;e
two places is not great. Even here I have
made a provi&s;ion of &s;hirts for one half of the
money they would have co&s;t in London. Un|doubtedly
the practice of &s;muggling is very
<PB N="61" REF="63">
detrimental to the fair trader, and carries con|&s;iderable
&s;ums of money out of the kingdom,
to enrich our rivals and enemies. The cu&s;|tom-hou&s;e
officers are very watchful, and
make a great number of &s;eizures: neverthele&s;s,
the &s;mugglers find their account in
continuing this contraband commerce; and
are &s;aid to indemnify them&s;elves, if they &s;ave
one cargo out of three. After all, the be&s;t
way to prevent &s;muggling, is to lower the
duties upon the commodities which are thus
introduced. I have been told, that the reve|nue
upon tea has encrea&s;ed ever &s;ince the
duty upon it was dimini&s;hed. By the bye,
the tea &s;muggled on the coa&s;t of Su&s;&s;ex is
mo&s;t execrable &s;tuff. While I &s;tayed at Ha&s;|tings,
for the conveniency of bathing, I mu&s;t
have changed my breakfa&s;t, if I had not lucki|ly
brought tea with me from London: yet
we have as good tea at Boulogne for nine
livres a pound, as that which &s;ells at four|teen
&s;hillings at London.</P>
<P>The bourgeois of this place &s;eem to live at
their ea&s;e, probably in con&s;equence of their
trade with the Engli&s;h. Their hou&s;es con&s;i&s;t
of the ground-floor, one &s;tory above, and
<PB N="62" REF="64">
garrets. In tho&s;e which are well furni&s;hed,
you &s;ee pier-gla&s;&s;es and marble &s;labs; but
the chairs are either paultry things, made
with &s;traw bottoms, which co&s;t about a &s;hil|ling
a-piece, or old-fa&s;hioned, high-backed
&s;eats of needle-work, &s;tuffed, very clum&s;y
and incommodious. The tables are &s;quare
fir boards, that &s;tand on edge in a corner, ex|cept
when they are u&s;ed, and then they are
&s;et upon cro&s;s legs that open and &s;hut occa|&s;ionally.
The king of France-dines off a
board of this kind. Here is plenty of table-linen
however. The poore&s;t trade&s;man in
Boulogne has a napkin on every cover, and
&s;ilver forks with four prongs, which are u&s;ed
with the right hand, there being very little
occa&s;ion for knives; for the meat is boiled o$
roa&s;ted to rags. The French beds are &s;o high$
that &s;ometimes one is obliged to mount the$
by the help of &s;teps; and this is al&s;o the ca$
in Flanders. They very &s;eldom u&s;e feather
$beds; but they lie upon a <HI>pailla&s;&s;e,</HI> or ba$
of &s;traw, over which are laid two, and &s;ome$
times three mattra&s;&s;es. Their te&s;ters are hig$
and old-fa&s;hioned, and their curtains ge|nerally
of thin bays, red, or green, laced wit$
<PB N="63" REF="65">
taudry yellow, in imitation of gold. In &s;ome
hou&s;es, however, one meets with furniture of
&s;tamped linen; but there is no &s;uch thing as
a carpet to be &s;een, and the floors are in a
very dirty condition. They have not even the
implements of cleanline&s;s in this country.
Every chamber is furni&s;hed with an <HI>armoire,</HI>
or clothes-pre&s;s, and a che&s;t of drawers, of
very clum&s;y workman&s;hip. Every thing
&s;hews a deficiency in the mechanic arts.
There is not a door, nor a window, that &s;huts
clo&s;e. The hinges, locks, and latches, are of
iron, coar&s;ely made, and ill contrived. The
very chimnies are built &s;o open, that they ad|mit
both rain and &s;un, and all of them &s;moke
intolerably. If there is no cleanline&s;s among
the&s;e people, much le&s;s &s;hall we find delicacy,
which is the cleanline&s;s of the mind. Indeed
they are utter &s;trangers to what we call common
decency; and I could give you &s;ome high-fla|voured
in&s;tances, at which even a native of
Edinburgh would &s;top his no&s;e. There are
certain mortifying views of human nature,
which undoubtedly ought to be concealed as
much as po&s;&s;ible, in order to prevent giving
offence: and nothing can be more ab&s;urd,
<PB N="64" REF="66">
than to plead the difference of cu&s;tom in dif|ferent
countries, in defence of tho&s;e u&s;ages
which cannot fail giving di&s;gu&s;t to the organs
and &s;en&s;es of all mankind. Will cu&s;tom ex|empt
from the imputation of gro&s;s indecency
a French lady, who &s;hifts her frow&s;y &s;mock
in pre&s;ence of a male vi&s;itant, and talks to
him of her <HI>lavement,</HI> her <HI>medicine,</HI> and her
<HI>bidet!</HI> An Italian <HI>&s;ignora</HI> makes no &s;cruple of
telling you, &s;he is &s;uch a day to begin a cour&s;e
of phy&s;ic for the <HI>pox.</HI> The celebrated re|former
of the Italian comedy introduces a
child befouling it&s;elf on the &s;tage, OE, NO
TI SENTI? BISOGNA DESFASSARLO, <HI>(fa cenno
che sentesi mal odore).</HI> I have known a lady
handed to the hou&s;e of office by her admirer,
who &s;tood at the door, and entertained her
with <HI>bons mots</HI> all the time &s;he was within.
But I &s;hould be glad to know, whether it is
po&s;&s;ible for a fine lady to &s;peak and act in this
manner, without exciting ideas to her own
di&s;advantage in the mind of every man who
has any imagination left, and enjoys the in|tire
u&s;e of his &s;en&s;es, how&s;oever &s;he may be
authori&s;ed by the cu&s;toms of her country&punc;
There is nothing &s;o vile or repugnant to na|ture,
<PB N="65" REF="67">
but you may plead pre&s;cription for it,
in the cu&s;toms of &s;ome nation or other. A
Pari&s;ian likes mortified fle&s;h: a native of
Legiboli will not ta&s;te his fi&s;h till it is quite
putrefied: the civilized inhabitants of Kam|&s;chatka
get drunk with the urine of their
gue&s;ts, whom they have already intoxicated:
the Nova Zemblans make merry on train-oil:
the Groenlanders eat in the &s;ame di&s;h
with their dogs: the Caffres, at the Cape of
Good Hope, pi&s;s upon tho&s;e whom they de|light
to honour, and fea&s;t upon a &s;heep's in|te&s;tines
with their contents, as the greate&s;t
dainty that can be pre&s;ented. A true-bred
Frenchman dips his fingers, imbrowned with
&s;nuff, into his plate filled with ragout:
between every three mouthfuls, he produces
his &s;nuff-box, and takes a fre&s;h pinch, with
the mo&s;t graceful ge&s;ticulations; then he
di&s;plays his handkerchief, which may be
termed the <HI>flag of abomination,</HI> and, in the
u&s;e of both, &s;catters his favours among tho&s;e
who have the happine&s;s to &s;it near him. It
mu&s;t be owned, however, that a Frenchman
will not drink out of a tankard, in which,
perhaps, a dozen of filthy mouths have &s;lab|bered,
<PB N="66" REF="68">
as is the cu&s;tom in England. Here
every individual has his own gobelet, which
&s;tands before him, and he helps him&s;elf oc|ca&s;ionally
with wine, or water, or both,
which likewi&s;e &s;tand upon the table. But I
know no cu&s;tom more bea&s;tly than that of
u&s;ing water-gla&s;&s;es, in which polite company
&s;pirit, and &s;quirt, and &s;pue the filthy &s;courings
of their gums, under the eyes of each
other. I knew a lover cured of his pa&s;&s;ion,
by &s;eeing this na&s;ty ca&s;cade di&s;charged from
the mouth of his mi&s;tre&s;s. I don't doubt but
I &s;hall live to &s;ee the day, when the ho&s;pita|ble
cu&s;tom of the antient Aegyptians will be
revived; then a conveniency will be placed
behind every chair in company, with a pro|per
provi&s;ion of wa&s;te paper, that individu|als
may make them&s;elves ea&s;y without part|ing
company. I in&s;i&s;t upon it, that this
practice would not be more indelicate than
that which is now in u&s;e. What then, you
will &s;ay, mu&s;t a man &s;it with his chops and
fingers up to the ears and knuckles in
grea&s;e? No; let tho&s;e who cannot eat with|out
defiling them&s;elves, &s;tep into another
room, provided with ba&s;ons and towels: but
<PB N="67" REF="69">
I think it be would better to in&s;titute &s;chools,
where youth may learn to eat their victuals,
without daubing them&s;elves, or giving of|fence
to the eyes of one another.</P>
<P>The bourgeois of Boulogne have commonly
&s;oup and bouill&eacute; at noon, and a roa&s;t, with
a &s;allad, for &s;upper; and at all their meals
there is a de&s;ert of fruit. This indeed is the
practice all over France. On meagre days
they eat fi&s;h, omelettes, fried beans, frica&s;|&s;ees
of eggs and onions, and burnt cream.
The tea which they drink in the afternoon is
rather boiled than infu&s;ed; it is &s;weetened all
together with coar&s;e &s;ugar, and drank with
an equal quantity of boiled milk.</P>
<P>We had the honour to be entertained the
other day by our landlord, Mr. B&mdash;, who
&s;pared no co&s;t on this banquet, exhibited for
the glory of France. He had invited a new-married
couple, together with the hu&s;band's
mother, and the lady's father, who was one
of the noble&s;&s;e of Montreuil, his name Mon&s;.
L&mdash;y. There were likewi&s;e &s;ome merchants
of the town, and Mon&s;. B&mdash;'s uncle, a fa|cetious
little man, who had &s;erved in the Eng|li&s;h
navy, and was as big and as round as a
<PB N="68" REF="70">
hog&s;head; we were likewi&s;e favoured with the
company of father K&mdash;, a native of Ireland,
who is <HI>vicaire,</HI> or curate of the pari&s;h; and
among the gue&s;ts was Mon&s;. L&mdash;y's &s;on, a
pretty boy, about thirteen or fourteen years
of age. The <HI>repas</HI> &s;erved up in three &s;er|vices,
or cour&s;es, with <HI>entre&eacute;s</HI> and <HI>hors
d'oeuvres,</HI> exclu&s;ive of the fruit, con&s;i&s;ted of
above twenty di&s;hes, extremely well dre&s;&s;ed
by the <HI>roti&s;&s;eur,</HI> who is the be&s;t cook I ever
knew, in France, or el&s;ewhere; but the <HI>plats</HI>
were not pre&s;ented with much order. Our
young ladies did not &s;eem to be much u&s;ed
to do the honours of the table. The mo&s;t
extraordinary circum&s;tance that I ob&s;erved
on this occa&s;ion was, that all the French who
were pre&s;ent ate of every di&s;h that appear|ed;
and I am told, that if there had been an
hundred articles more, they would have had
a trial of each. This is what they call doing
ju&s;tice to the founder. Mon&s;. L&mdash;y was
placed at the head of the table; and indeed
he was the oracle and orator of the compa|ny;
tall, thin, and weather-beaten, not un|like
the picture of Don Quixote after he had
lo&s;t his teeth. He had been <HI>garde du corps,</HI>
<PB N="69" REF="71">
or life-guardman at Ver&s;ailles; and by virtue
of this office he was perfectly well acquaint|ed
with the per&s;ons of the king and the dau|phin,
with the characters of the mini&s;ters
and grandees, and, in a word, with all the
&s;ecrets of &s;tate, on which he held forth with
equal &s;olemnity and elocution. He exclaim|ed
again&s;t the je&s;uits, and the farmers of the
revenue, who, he &s;aid, had ruined France.
Then, addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to me, a&s;ked, if
the Engli&s;h did not every day drink to the
health of <HI>madame la marqui&s;e?</HI> I did not at
fir&s;t comprehend his meaning; but an&s;wered
in general, that the Engli&s;h were not defici|ent
in complai&s;ance for the ladies. &startq;Ah!
(cried he) &s;he is the be&s;t friend they have in
the world. If it had not been for her, they
would not have &s;uch rea&s;on to boa&s;t of the
advantages of the war.&endq; I told him the on|ly
conque&s;t which the French had made in
the war, was atchieved by one of her gene|rals:
I meant the taking of Mahon. But I
did not choo&s;e to pro&s;ecute the di&s;cour&s;e, re|membering
that in the year 1749, I had like
to have had an affair with a Frenchman at
Ghent, who affirmed, that all the battles
<PB N="70" REF="72">
gained by the great duke of Marlborough
were purpo&s;ely lo&s;t by the French generals,
in order to bring the &s;chemes of madame de
Maintenon into di&s;grace. This is no bad
re&s;ource for the national vanity of the&s;e peo|ple:
though, in general, they are really per|&s;uaded,
that theirs is the riche&s;t, the brave&s;t,
the happie&s;t, and the mo&s;t powerful nation
under the &s;un; and therefore, without &s;ome
&s;uch cau&s;e, they mu&s;t be invincible. By the
bye, the common people here &s;till frighten
their wayward children with the name of
<HI>Marlborough.</HI> Mr. B&mdash;'s &s;on, who was
nur&s;ed at a pea&s;ant's hou&s;e, happening one
day, after he was brought home, to be in
di&s;grace with his father, who threatened to
correct him, the child ran for protection to
his mother, crying, &startq;<HI>faites &s;ortir ce vilaine
Malbroug.</HI>&endq; It is amazing to hear a &s;en&s;ible
Frenchman a&s;&s;ert, that the revenues of France
amount to four hundred millions of livres,
about twenty millions &s;terling, clear of all
incumbrances, when in fact their clear reve|nue
is not much above ten. Without all
doubt they have rea&s;on to inveigh again&s;t the
$span$, who oppre&s;s the people in
<PB N="71" REF="73">
rai&s;ing the taxes, not above two thirds of
which are brought into the king's coffers:
the re&s;t enriches them&s;elves, and enables them
to bribe high for the protection of the great,
which is the only &s;upport they have again&s;t
the remon&s;trances of the &s;tates and parlia|ments,
and the &s;ugge&s;tions of common &s;en&s;e;
which will ever demon&s;trate this to be, of
all others, the mo&s;t pernicious method of
&s;upplying the nece&s;&s;ities of government.</P>
<P>Mon&s;. L&mdash;y &s;ea&s;oned the &s;everity of his
political apothegms with intermediate &s;allies
of mirth and gallantry. He ogled the ve|nerable
gentlewoman his <HI>commere,</HI> who &s;at by
him. He looked, &s;ighed, and langui&s;hed,
&s;ung tender &s;ongs, and ki&s;&s;ed the old lady's
hand with all the ardour of a youthful ad|mirer.
I unfortunately congratulated him
on having &s;uch a pretty young gentleman to
his &s;on. He an&s;wered, &s;ighing, that the
boy had talents, but did not put them to a
proper u&s;e&mdash;&startq;long before I attained his age

his neck, when the duke's &s;cuilions in&s;i&s;ted
upon &s;having him; this &s;ea-wit, turning to
the boy, with a waggi&s;h leer, &startq;I &s;uppo&s;e
(&s;aid he) you don't under&s;tand the figure of
<HI>amplification</HI> &s;o well as Mon&s;ieur your father.&endq;
At that in&s;tant, one of the nieces, who
knew her uncle to be very tickli&s;h, touched
him under the &s;hort ribs, on which the little
man attempted to &s;pring up, but lo&s;t the
centre of gravity. He overturned his own
plate in the lap of the per&s;on that &s;at next to
him, and falling obliquely upon his own
chair, both tumbled down upon the floor to|gether,
to the great di&s;compo&s;ure of the
whole company; for the poor man would
have been actually &s;trangled, had not his
nephew loo&s;ed his &s;tock with great expedi|tion.
Matters being once more adju&s;ted, and
the captain condoled on his di&s;a&s;ter, Mon&s;.
L&mdash;y took it in his head to read his &s;on a
lecture upon filial obedience. This was min|gled
with &s;ome &s;harp reproof, which the boy
took &s;o ill that he retired. The old lady ob|&s;erved
that he had been too &s;evere: her daugh|ter-in-law,
who was very pretty, &s;aid her bro|ther
<PB N="73" REF="75">
had given him too much rea&s;on; hint|ing,
at the &s;ame time, that he was addicted
to &s;ome terrible vices; upon which &s;everal
individuals repeated the interjection, ah!
ah! &startq;Yes (&s;aid Mon&s;. L&mdash;y, with a rue|ful
a&s;pect) the boy has a pernicious turn for
gaming: in one afternoon he lo&s;t, at billi|ards,
&s;uch a &s;um as gives me horror to think
of it.&endq; &startq;Fifty &s;ols in one afternoon,&endq; (cri|ed
the &s;i&s;ter) &startq;Fifty &s;ols! (exclaimed the

Mon&s;. L&mdash;y&mdash;ah! vive la jeune&s;&s;e!&endq; &startq;et
l'amour!&endq; cried the father, wiping his eyes,
&s;queezing her hand, and looking tenderly
upon her. Mr. B&mdash;took this opportunity
to bring in the young gentleman, who was
admitted into favour, and received a &s;econd
exhortation. Thus harmony was re&s;tored,
and the entertainment concluded with fruit,
coffee, and <HI>liqueurs.</HI></P>
<P>When a bourgeois of Boulogne takes the
air, he goes in a one hor&s;e-chai&s;e, which is here
called <HI>cabriolet,</HI> and hires it for half-a-crown
a day. There are al&s;o travelling chai&s;es, which
<PB N="74" REF="76">
hold four per&s;ons, two &s;eated with their faces
to the hor&s;es, and two behind their backs;
but tho&s;e vehicles are all very ill made, and
extremely inconvenient. The way of riding
mo&s;t u&s;ed in this place is on a&s;sback. You
will &s;ee every day, in the &s;kirts of the town,
a great number of females thus mounted,
with the feet on either &s;ide occa&s;ionally, ac|cording
as the wind blows, &s;o that &s;ometimes
the right and &s;ometimes the left hand guides
the bea&s;t: but in other parts of France, as
well as in Italy, the ladies &s;it on hor&s;eback
with their legs a&s;tride, and are provided with
drawers for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>When I &s;aid the French people were kept
in good humour by the fopperies of their re|ligion,
I did not mean that there were no
gloomy &s;pirits among them. There will be
fanatics in religion, while there are people
of a saturnine di&s;po&s;ition, and melancholy
turn of mind. The character of a <HI>devotee,</HI>
which is hardly known in England, is very
common here. You &s;ee them walking to
and from church at all hours, in their hoods
and long camblet cloaks, with a &s;low pace,
demure a&s;pect, and downca&s;t eye. Tho&s;e who
<PB N="75" REF="77">
are poor become very trouble&s;ome to the
monks, with their &s;cruples and ca&s;es of con|&s;cience:
you may &s;ee them on their knees,
at the confe&s;&s;ional, every hour in the day.
The rich <HI>devotee</HI> has her favourite confe&s;&s;or,
whom &s;he con&s;ults and regales in private, at
her own hou&s;e; and this &s;piritual director
generally governs the whole family. For
my part, I never knew a fanatic that was
not an hypocrite at bottom. Their preten|&s;ions
to &s;uperior &s;anctity, and an ab&s;olute
conque&s;t over all the pa&s;&s;ions, which human
rea&s;on was never yet able to &s;ubdue, intro|duce
a habit of di&s;&s;imulation, which, like
all other habits, is confirmed by u&s;e, till at
length they become adepts in the art and
&s;cience of hypocri&s;y. Enthu&s;ia&s;m and hy|pocri&s;y
are by no means incompatible. The
wilde&s;t fanatics I ever knew, were real &s;en&s;u|ali&s;ts
in their way of living, and cunning
cheats in their dealings with mankind.</P>
<P>Among the lower cla&s;s of people at Bou|logne,
tho&s;e who take the lead, are the &s;ea-faring
men, who live in one quarter, divided
into cla&s;&s;es, and regi&s;tered for the &s;ervice of
the king. They are hardy and raw-boned,
<PB N="76" REF="78">
exerci&s;e the trade of fi&s;hermen and boatmen,
and propagate like rabbits. They have put
them&s;elves under the protection of a mira|culous
image of the Virgin Mary, which is
kept in one of their churches, and every
year carried in proce&s;&s;ion. According to the
legend, this image was carried off, with o|ther
pillage, by the Engli&s;h, when they took
Boulogne, in the reign of Henry VIII. The
lady, rather than re&s;ide in England, where
&s;he found a great many heretics, tru&s;ted her|&s;elf
alone in an open boat, and cro&s;&s;ed the
&s;ea to the road of Boulogne, where &s;he was
&s;een waiting for a pilot. Accordingly a boat
put off to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and brought her
&s;afe into the harbour: &s;ince which time &s;he
has continued to patronize the watermen of
Boulogne. At pre&s;ent &s;he is very black and
very ugly, be&s;ides being cruelly mutilated in
different parts of her body, which I &s;uppo&s;e
have been amputated, and converted into to|bacco-&s;toppers;
but once a year &s;he is dre&s;&s;ed
in very rich attire, and carried in proce&s;&s;ion,
with a &s;ilver boat, provided at the expence of
the &s;ailors. That vanity which characteri&s;es
the French extends even to the canaille,
<PB N="77" REF="79">
The lowe&s;t creature among them is &s;ure to
have her ear-rings and golden cro&s;s hanging
about her neck. Indeed this la&s;t is an imple|ment
of &s;uper&s;tition as well as of dre&s;s, with|out
which no female appears. The common
people here, as in all countries where they
live poorly and dirtily, are hard-featured,
and of very brown, or rather tawny com|plexions.
As they &s;eldom eat meat, their
juices are de&s;titute of that animal oil which
gives a plumpne&s;s and &s;moothne&s;s to the &s;kin,
and defends tho&s;e fine capillaries from the
injuries of the weather, which would other|wi&s;e
coale&s;ce, or be &s;hrunk up, &s;o as to im|pede
the circulation on the external &s;urface of
the body. As for the dirt, it undoubtedly
blocks up the pores of the &s;kin, and di&s;or|ders
the per&s;piration; con&s;equently mu&s;t con|tribute
to the &s;curvy, itch, and other cuta|neous
di&s;tempers.</P>
<P>In the quarter of the <HI>matelots</HI> at Boulogne,
there is a number of poor Canadians, who
were removed from the i&s;land of St. John,
in the gulph of St. Laurence, when it was
reduced by the Engli&s;h. The&s;e people are
maintained at the expence of the king, who
<PB N="78" REF="80">
allows them &s;oldier's pay, that is five &s;ols,
or two-pence halfpenny a day; or rather
three &s;ols and ammunition bread. How the
&s;oldiers contrive to &s;ub&s;i&s;t upon this wretched
allowance, I cannot comprehend: but, it
mu&s;t be owned, that tho&s;e invalids who do
duty at Boulogne betray no marks of want.
They are hale and &s;tout, neatly and de|cently
cloathed, and on the whole look bet|ter
than the pen&s;ioners of Chel&s;ea.</P>
<P>About three weeks ago I was favoured with a
vi&s;it by one Mr. M&mdash;, an Engli&s;h gentleman,
who &s;eems far gone in a con&s;umption. He pa&s;&s;ed
the la&s;t winter at Ni&s;mes in Languedoc, and
found him&s;elf much better in the beginning
of &s;ummer, when he embarked at Cette, and
returned by &s;ea to England. He &s;oon re|lap&s;ed,
however, and (as he imagines) in
con&s;equence of a cold caught at &s;ea. He told
me, his intention was to try the South again,
and even to go as far as Italy. I advi&s;ed him
to make trial of the air of Nice, where I
my&s;elf propo&s;ed to re&s;ide. He &s;eemed to re|li&s;h
my advice, and proceeded towards Pari$
in his own carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="81">
I &s;hall to-morrow &s;hip my great che&s;ts on
board of a &s;hip bound to Bourdeaux; they
are directed, and recommended to the care of
a merchant of that place, who will forward
them by Thoulou&s;e, and the canal of Lan|guedoc,
to his corre&s;pondent at Cette, which
is the &s;ea-port of Montpellier. The charge
of their conveyance to Bourdeaux does not
exceed one guinea. They con&s;i&s;t of two very
large che&s;ts and a trunk, about a thou&s;and
pounds weight; and the expence of tran&s;|porting
them from Bourdeaux to Cette, will
not exceed thirty livres. They are already
&s;ealed with lead at the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, that
they may be exempted from further vi&s;itation.
This is a precaution which every traveller
takes, both by &s;ea and land: he mu&s;t like|wi&s;e
provide him&s;elf with a <HI>pa&s;&s;e-avant</HI> at the
bureau, otherwi&s;e he may be &s;topped, and
rummaged at every town through which he
pa&s;&s;es. I have hired a berline and four hor&s;es
to Paris, for fourteen loui'dores; two of
which the <HI>voiturier</HI> is obliged to pay for a
permi&s;&s;ion from the farmers of the po&s;te;
for every thing is farmed in this country;
and if you hire a carriage, as I have done,
<PB N="80" REF="82">
you mu&s;t pay twelve livres, or half a guinea,
for every per&s;on that travels in it. The com|mon
coach between Calais and Paris, is &s;uch
a vehicle as no man would u&s;e, who has any
regard to his own ea&s;e and convenience; and
it travels at the pace of an Engli&s;h waggon.</P>
<P>In ten days I &s;hall &s;et out on my journey;
and I &s;hall leave Boulogne with regret. I have
been happy in the acquaintance of Mrs. B&mdash;,
and a few Briti&s;h families in the place; and
it was my good fortune to meet here with two
hone&s;t gentlemen, whom I had formerly
known in Paris, as well as with &s;ome of my
countrymen, officers in the &s;ervice of France.
My next will be from Paris. Remember me
to our friends at A&mdash;'s. I am a little hea|vy-hearted
at the pro&s;pect of removing to
&s;uch a di&s;tance from you. It is a moot poin$
whether I &s;hall ever return. My health is
very precarious.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>October 12, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>OF our journey from Boulogne I have
little to &s;ay. The weather was favour|able,
and the roads were in tolerable order. We
found good accommodation at Montreuil and
Amiens; but in every other place where we
&s;topped, we met with abundance of dirt,
and the mo&s;t flagrant impo&s;ition. I &s;hall not
pretend to de&s;cribe the cities of Abbeville and
Amiens, which we &s;aw only <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant;</HI> nor
take up your time with an account of the
&s;tables and palace of Chantilly, belonging
to the prince of Cond&eacute;, which we vi&s;ited the
la&s;t day of our journey; nor &s;hall I detain
you with a detail of the <HI>Tre&s;ors de St. De|nis,</HI>
which, together with the tombs in the
abbey church, afforded us &s;ome amu&s;ement
while our dinner was getting ready. All
the&s;e particulars are mentioned in twenty dif|ferent
books of tours, travels, and directi|ons,
<PB N="82" REF="84">
which you have often peru&s;ed. I &s;hall
only ob&s;erve, that the abbey church is the
lighte&s;t piece of Gothic architecture I have
&s;een, and the air within &s;eems perfectly free
from that damp and moi&s;ture, &s;o perceivable
in all our old cathedrals. This mu&s;t be ow|ing
to the nature of its &s;ituation. There are
&s;ome fine marble &s;tatues that adorn the tombs
of certain individuals here interred; but they
are mo&s;tly in the French ta&s;te, which is quite
contrary to the &s;implicity of the antients.
Their attitudes are affected, unnatural, and
de&s;ultory; and their draperies fanta&s;tic; or,
as one of our Engli&s;h arti&s;ts expre&s;&s;ed him|&s;elf,
<HI>they are all of a flutter.</HI> As for the trea|&s;ures,
which are &s;hewn on certain days to the
populace gratis, they are contained in a num|ber
of pre&s;&s;es, or armoires, and, if the &s;tones
are genuine, they mu&s;t be ine&s;timable: but
this I cannot believe. Indeed I have been
told, that what they &s;hew as diamonds are
no more than compo&s;ition: neverthele&s;s, ex|clu&s;ive
of the&s;e, there are &s;ome rough &s;tones
of great value, and many curio&s;ities worth
&s;eeing. The monk that &s;hewed them wa$
<PB N="83" REF="85">
the very image of our friend Hamilton, both
in his looks and manner.</P>
<P>I have one thing very extraordinary to
ob&s;erve of the French auberges, which &s;eems
to be a remarkable deviation from the gene|ral
character of the nation. The landlords,
ho&s;te&s;&s;es, and &s;ervants of the inns upon the
road, have not the lea&s;t da&s;h of complai&s;ance
in their behaviour to &s;trangers. In&s;tead of
coming to the door, to receive you as in Eng|land,
they take no manner of notice of you;
but leave you to find or enquire your way
into the kitchen, and there you mu&s;t a&s;k
&s;everal times for a chamber, before they &s;eem
willing to conduct you up &s;tairs. In gene|ral,
you are &s;erved with the appearance of
the mo&s;t mortifying indifference, at the very
time they are laying &s;chemes for fleecing you
of your money. It is a very odd contra&s;t
between France and England; in the former
all the people are complai&s;ant but the publi|cans;
in the latter there is hardly any com|plai&s;ance
but among the publicans. When
I &s;aid all the people in France, I ought al&s;o
to except tho&s;e vermin who examine the bag|gage
of travellers in different parts of the
<PB N="84" REF="86">
kingdom. Although our portmanteaus were
&s;ealed with lead, and we were provided with
a pa&s;&s;e-avant from the douane, our coach
was &s;earched at the gate of Paris by which
we entered; and the women were obliged to
get out, and &s;tand in the open &s;treet, till this
operation was performed.</P>
<P>I had de&s;ired a friend to provide lodg|ings
for me at Paris, in the Faux|bourg
St. Germain; and accordingly we
found our&s;elves accommodated at the Hotel
de Montmorency, with a fir&s;t floor, which
co&s;ts me ten livres a day. I &s;hould have put
up with it had it been le&s;s polite; but as I
have only a few days to &s;tay in this place,
and &s;ome vi&s;its to receive, I am not &s;orry
that my friend has exceeded his commi&s;&s;ion.
I have been guilty of another piece of extra|vagance
in hiring a <HI>caro&s;&s;e de remi&s;e,</HI> for which
I pay twelve livres a day. Be&s;ides the arti|cle
of vi&s;iting, I could not leave Paris, with|out
carrying my wife and the girls to &s;ee the
mo&s;t remarkable places in and about this
capital, &s;uch as the Luxemburg, the Palais-Royal,
the Thuilleries, the Louvre, the In|valids,
the Gobelins, &amp;c. together with Ver|&s;ailles,
<PB N="85" REF="87">
Trianon, Marli, Meudon, and Choi&s;&s;i;
and therefore, I thought the difference in
point of expence would not be great, be|tween
a caro&s;&s;e de remi&s;e and a hackney
coach. The fir&s;t are extremely elegant, if
not too much ornamented, the la&s;t are very
&s;habby and di&s;agreeable. Nothing gives me
&s;uch chagrin, as the nece&s;&s;ity I am under
to hire a <HI>valet de place,</HI> as my own &s;ervant
does not &s;peak the language. You cannot
conceive with what eagerne&s;s and dexterity
tho&s;e ra&s;cally valets exert them&s;elves in pillag|ing
&s;trangers. There is always one ready in
waiting on your arrival, who begins by a&s;&s;i&s;t|ing
your own &s;ervant to unload your bag|gage,
and intere&s;ts him&s;elf in your affairs
with &s;uch artful officiou&s;ne&s;s, that you will
find it difficult to &s;hake him off, even though
you are determined beforehand again&s;t hiring
any &s;uch dome&s;tic. He produces recommen|dations
from his former ma&s;ters, and the
people of the hou&s;e vouch for his hone&s;ty.
The truth is, tho&s;e fellows are very handy,
u&s;eful, and obliging; and &s;o far hone&s;t, that
they will not &s;teal in the u&s;ual way. You
<PB N="86" REF="88">
may &s;afely tru&s;t one of them to bring you
a hundred loui'dores from your banker; but
they fleece you without mercy in every other
article of expence. They lay all your trade&s;|men
under contribution; your taylor, bar|ber,
mantua-maker, milliner, perfumer, &s;hoe|maker,
mercer, jeweller, hatter, traiteur,
and wine-merchant: even the bourgeouis who
owns your coach pays him twenty &s;ols per
day. His wages amount to twice as much,
&s;o that I imagine the fellow that &s;erves me,
makes above ten &s;hillings a day, be&s;ides his
victuals, which, by the bye, he has no right
to demand. Living at Paris, to the be&s;t of
my recollection, is very near twice as dear
as it was fifteen years ago; and, indeed, this
is the ca&s;e in London; a circum&s;tance that
mu&s;t be undoubtedly owing to an increa&s;e of
taxes; for I don't find that in the articles of
eating and drinking, the French people are
more luxurious than they were heretofore. I
am told the <HI>entrees,</HI> or duties, payed upon
provi&s;ion imported into Paris, are very hea|vy.
All manner of butchers meat and poul|try
are extremely good in this place. The
beef is excellent. The wine, which is gene|rally
<PB N="87" REF="89">
drank, is a very thin kind of Burgun|dy.
I can by no means reli&s;h their cookery;
but one breakfa&s;ts deliciou&s;ly upon their <HI>petit
pains</HI> and their <HI>pat&eacute;s</HI> of butter, which la&s;t is
exqui&s;ite.</P>
<P>The common people, and even the bour|geois
of Paris live, at this &s;ea&s;on, chiefly on
bread and grapes, which is undoubtedly very
whol&s;ome fare. If the &s;ame &s;implicity of diet
prevailed in England, we &s;hould certainly
under&s;el the French at all foreign markets:
for they are very &s;lothful with all their viva|city;
and the great number of their holidays
not only encourages this lazy di&s;po&s;ition, but
actually robs them of one half of what their
labour would otherwi&s;e produce; &s;o that, if
our common people were not &s;o expen&s;ive in
their living, that is, in their eating and drink|ing,
labour might be afforded cheaper in
England than in France. There are three
young lu&s;ty hu&s;&s;ies, nieces or daughters of
a black&s;mith, that lives ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to my
windows, who do nothing from morning till
night. They eat grapes and bread from &s;e|ven
till nine, from nine till twelve they dre&s;s
their hair, and are all the afternoon gaping
<PB N="88" REF="90">
at the window to view pa&s;&s;engers. I don't
perceive that they give them&s;elves the trouble
either to make their beds, or clean their apart|ment.
The &s;ame &s;pirit of idlene&s;s and di&s;&s;i|pation
I have ob&s;erved in every part of France,
and among every cla&s;s of people.</P>
<P>Every object &s;eems to have &s;hrunk in its
dimen&s;ions &s;ince I was la&s;t in Paris. The
Louvre, the Palais Royal, the bridges, and
the river Seine, by no means an&s;wer the i|deas
I had formed of them from my former
ob&s;ervation. When the memory is not very
correct, the imagination always betrays her
into &s;uch extravagances. When I fir&s;t re|vi&s;ited
my own country, after an ab&s;ence of
fourteen years, I found every thing dimini&s;h|ed
in the &s;ame manner, and I could &s;carce
believe my own eyes.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the gay di&s;po&s;ition of the
French, their hou&s;es are all gloomy. In &s;pite
of all the ornaments that have been lavi&s;hed
on Ver&s;ailles, it is a di&s;mal habitation. The
apartments are dark, ill-furni&s;hed, dirty, and
unprincely. Take the ca&s;tle, chapel, and
garden all together, they make a mo&s;t fan|ta&s;tic
compo&s;ition of magnificence and little|ne&s;s,
<PB N="89" REF="91">
ta&s;te, and foppery. After all, it is
in England only, where we mu&s;t look for
cheerful apartments, gay furniture, neatne&s;s,
and convenience. There is a &s;trange incon|gruity
in the French genius. With all their
volatility, prattle, and fondne&s;s for <HI>bons mots,</HI>
they delight in a &s;pecies of drawling, me|lancholy,
church mu&s;ic. Their mo&s;t fa|vourite
dramatic pieces are almo&s;t without
incident; and the dialogue of their come|dies
con&s;i&s;ts of moral, in&s;ipid apophthegms,
intirely de&s;titute of wit, or repartee. I know
what I hazard by this opinion among the
implicit admirers of Lully, Racine, and Mo|liere.</P>
<P>I don't talk of the bu&s;ts, the &s;tatues, and
pictures which abound at Ver&s;ailles, and o|ther
places, in and about Paris, particularly
the great collection of capital pieces in the
Palais-royal, belonging to the duke of Or|leans.
I have neither capacity, nor inclina|tion,
to give a critique on the&s;e <HI>chef d'oeuvres,</HI>
which indeed would take up a whole vo|lume.
I have &s;een this great magazine of
painting three times, with a&s;toni&s;hment; but
I &s;hould have been better plea&s;ed, if there
<PB N="90" REF="92">
had not been half the number: one is
bewildered in &s;uch a profu&s;ion, as not to
know where to begin, and hurried a|way
before there is time to con&s;ider one
piece with any &s;ort of deliberation. Be&s;ides,
the rooms are all dark, and a great many of
the pictures hang in a bad light. As for
Trianon, Marli, and Choi&s;&s;i, they are no
more than pigeon-hou&s;es, in re&s;pect to pa|laces;
and, notwith&s;tanding the extravagant
eulogiums which you have heard of the
French king's hou&s;es, I will venture to affirm,
that the king of England is better, I mean
more comfortably, lodged. I ought, how|ever,
to except Fontainebleau, which I have
not &s;een.</P>
<P>The city of Paris is &s;aid to be five leagues,
or fifteen miles, in circumference; and if it
is really &s;o, it mu&s;t be much more populous
than London; for the &s;treets are very nar|row,
and the hou&s;es very high, with a diffe|rent
family on every floor. But I have mea|&s;ured
the be&s;t plans of the&s;e two royal cities,
and am certain that Paris does not take up
near &s;o much ground as London and We&s;t|min&s;ter
occupy; and I &s;u&s;pect the number
<PB N="91" REF="93">
of its inhabitants is al&s;o exaggerated by tho&s;e
who &s;ay it amounts to eight hundred thou|&s;and,
that is two hundred thou&s;and more
than are contained in the bills of mortality.
The hotels of the French noble&s;&s;e, at Paris,
take up a great deal of room, with their
court-yards and gardens; and &s;o do their
convents and churches. It mu&s;t be owned,
indeed, that their &s;treets are wonderfully
crouded with people and carriages.</P>
<P>The French begin to imitate the Engli&s;h,
but only in &s;uch particulars as render them
worthy of imitation. When I was la&s;t at
Paris, no per&s;on of any condition, male or
female, appeared, but in full dre&s;s, even
when obliged to come out early in the morn|ing,
and there was not &s;uch a thing to be
&s;een as a <HI>peruque ronde;</HI> but at pre&s;ent I &s;ee
a number of frocks and &s;cratches in a morn|ing,
in the &s;treets of this metropolis. They
have &s;et up a <HI>petite po&s;te,</HI> on the plan of our
penny-po&s;t, with &s;ome improvements; and
I am told there is a &s;cheme on foot for &s;up|plying
every hou&s;e with water, by leaden
pipes, from the river Seine. They have even
adopted our practice of the cold bath, which
<PB N="92" REF="94">
is taken very conveniently, in wooden hou&s;es,
erected on the &s;ide of the river, the water of
which is let in and out occa&s;ionally, by cocks
fixed in the &s;ides of the bath. There are
different rooms for the different &s;exes: the
accommodations are good, and the expence
is a trifle. The tape&s;try of the Gobelins is
brought to an amazing degree of perfection;
and I am &s;urpri&s;ed that this furniture is not
more in fa&s;hion among the great, who alone
are able to purcha&s;e it. It would be a mo&s;t
elegant and magnificent ornament, which
would always nobly di&s;tingui&s;h their apart|ments
from tho&s;e of an inferior rank; and
in this they would run no ri&s;que of being ri|valled
by the bourgeois. At the village of
Chaillot, in the neighbourhood of Paris, they
make beautiful carpets and &s;creen-work; and
this is the more extraordinary, as there are
hardly any carpets u&s;ed in this kingdom. In
almo&s;t all the lodging-hou&s;es, the floors are
of brick, and have no other kind of clean|ing,
than that of being &s;prinkled with wa|ter,
and &s;wept once a day. The&s;e brick
floors, the &s;tone &s;tairs, the want of wain|&s;cotting
in the rooms, and the thick party|walls
<PB N="93" REF="95">
of &s;tone, are, however, good pre&s;er|vatives
again&s;t fire, which &s;eldom does any
damage in this city. In&s;tead of wain&s;cot|ting,
the walls are covered with tape&s;try or
dama&s;k. The beds in general are very good,
and well ornamented, with te&s;ters and cur|tains.</P>
<P>Fifteen years ago the river Seine, within a
mile of Paris, was as &s;olitary as if it had run
through a de&s;ert. At pre&s;ent the banks of
it are adorned with a number of elegant
hou&s;es and plantations, as far as Marli. I
need not mention the machine at this place
for rai&s;ing water, becau&s;e I know you are well
acquainted with its con&s;truction; nor &s;hall I
&s;ay any thing more of the city of Paris, but
that there is a new &s;quare, built upon an ele|gant
plan, at the end of the garden of the
Thuilleries: it is called Place de Louis XV.
and, in the middle of it, there is a good e|que&s;trian
&s;tatue of the reigning king.</P>
<P>You have often heard that Louis XIV. fre|quently
regretted, that his country did not
afford gravel for the walks of his gardens,
which are covered with a white, loo&s;e &s;and,
very di&s;agreeable both to the eyes and feet of
<PB N="94" REF="96">
tho&s;e who walk upon it; but this is a vul|gar
mi&s;take. There is plenty of gravel on
the road between Paris and Ver&s;ailles, as
well as in many other parts of this king|dom;
but the French, who are all for glare
and glitter, think the other is more gay and
agreeable: one would imagine they did not
feel the burning reflexion from the white
&s;and, which in &s;ummer is almo&s;t intole|rable.</P>
<P>In the character of the French, con&s;idered
as a people, there are undoubtedly many cir|cum&s;tances
truly ridiculous. You know the
fa&s;hionable people, who go a hunting, are
equipped with their jack boots, bag wigs,
&s;words and pi&s;tols: but I &s;aw the other day
a &s;cene &s;till more grote&s;que. On the road to
Choi&s;&s;i, a <HI>fiacre,</HI> or hackney-coach, &s;topped,
and out came five or &s;ix men, armed with
mu&s;quets, who took po&s;t, each behind a &s;e|parate
tree. I a&s;ked our &s;ervant who they
were, imagining they might be <HI>archers,</HI> o$
footpads of ju&s;tice, in pur&s;uit of &s;ome male|factor.
But gue&s;s my &s;urpri&s;e, when the fel|low
told me, they were gentlemen <HI>&agrave; la cha&s;&s;e</HI>
They were in fact come out from Paris, i$$
<PB N="95" REF="97">
this equipage, to take the diver&s;ion of hare|hunting;
that is, of &s;hooting from behind
a tree at the hares that chanced to pa&s;s. In|deed,
if they had nothing more in view, but
to de&s;troy the game, this was a very effectual
method; for the hares are in &s;uch plenty in
this neighbourhood, that I have &s;een a dozen
together, in the &s;ame field. I think this way
of hunting, in a coach or chariot, might be
properly adopted at London, in favour of
tho&s;e aldermen of the city, who are too un|wieldy
to follow the hounds a hor&s;eback.</P>
<P>The French, however, with all their ab|&s;urdities,
pre&s;erve a certain a&s;cendancy over
us, which is very di&s;graceful to our nation;
and this appears in nothing more than in
the article of dre&s;s. We are contented to be
thought their apes in fa&s;hion; but, in fact,
we are &s;laves to their taylors, mantua-mak|ers,
barbers, and other trade&s;men. One would
be apt to imagine that our own trade&s;men
had joined them in a combination again&s;t us.
When the natives of France come to Lon|don,
they appear in all public places, with
cloaths made according to the fa&s;hion of their
own country, and this fa&s;hion is generally
<PB N="96" REF="98">
admired by the Engli&s;h. Why, therefore,
don't we follow it implicitly? No, we pique
our&s;elves upon a mo&s;t ridiculous deviation
from the very modes we admire, and plea&s;e
our&s;elves with thinking this deviation is a
mark of our &s;pirit and liberty. But, we
have not &s;pirit enough to per&s;i&s;t in this de|viation,
when we vi&s;it their country: other|wi&s;e,
perhaps, they would come to admire
and follow our example: for, certainly, in
point of true ta&s;te, the fa&s;hions of both
countries are equally ab&s;urd. At pre&s;ent,
the &s;kirts of the Engli&s;h de&s;cend from the
fifth rib to the calf of the leg, and give the
coat the form of a Jewi&s;h gaberdine; and
our hats &s;eem to be modelled after that which
Pi&s;tol wears upon the &s;tage. In France, the
haunch buttons and pocket-holes are within
half a foot of the coat's extremity: their
hats look as if they had been pared round
the brims, and the crown is covered with a
kind of cordage, which, in my opinion pro|duces
a very beggarly effect. In every other
circum&s;tance of dre&s;s, male and female, the
contra&s;t between the two nations, appears e|qually
glaring. What is the con&s;equence?
<PB N="97" REF="99">
when an Engli&s;hman comes to Paris, he can|not
appear until he has undergone a total
metamorpho&s;is. At his fir&s;t arrival he finds
it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end for the taylor, peruquier,
hatter, &s;hoemaker, and every other trade&s;|man
concerned in the equipment of the hu|man
body. He mu&s;t even change his buckles,
and the form of his ruffles; and, though at
the ri&s;que of his life, &s;uit his cloaths to the
mode of the &s;ea&s;on. For example, though
the weather &s;hould be never &s;o cold, he mu&s;t
wear his <HI>habit d'et&eacute;,</HI> or <HI>de mi-&s;ai&s;on,</HI> without
pre&s;uming to put on a warm dre&s;s before the
day which fa&s;hion has fixed for that purpo&s;e;
and neither old age nor infirmity will excu&s;e
a man for wearing his hat upon his head,
either at home or abroad. Females are (if
po&s;&s;ible) &s;till more &s;ubject to the caprices of
fa&s;hion; and as the articles of their dre&s;s are
more manifold, it is enough to make a man's
heart ake to &s;ee his wife &s;urrounded by a
multitude of <HI>cotturieres,</HI> milliners, and tire-women.
All her &s;acks and negligees mu&s;t be
altered and new trimmed. She mu&s;t have
new caps, new laces, new &s;hoes, and her hair
new cut. She mu&s;t have her taffaties for the
<PB N="98" REF="100">
&s;ummer, her flowered &s;ilks for the &s;pring and
autumn, her &s;attins and dama&s;ks for winter.
The good man, who u&s;ed to wear the <HI>beau
drap d'Angleterre,</HI> quite plain all the year
round, with a long bob, or tye perriwig,
mu&s;t here provide him&s;elf with a camblet &s;uit
trimmed with &s;ilver for &s;pring and autumn,
with &s;ilk cloaths for &s;ummer, and cloth laced
with gold, or velvet for winter; and he mu&s;t
wear his bag-wig <HI>a la pigeon.</HI> This variety
of dre&s;s is ab&s;olutely indi&s;pen&s;ible for all tho&s;e
who pretend to any rank above the meer
bourgeois. On his return to his own country,
all this frippery is u&s;ele&s;s. He cannot appear
in London until he has undergone another
thorough metamorpho&s;is; &s;o that he will have
&s;ome rea&s;on to think, that the trade&s;men of
Paris and London have combined to lay him
under contribution: and they, no doubt, are
the directors who regulate the fa&s;hions in
both capitals; the Engli&s;h, however, in a
&s;ubordinate capacity: for the puppets of
their making will not pa&s;s at Paris, nor in|deed
in any other part of Europe; whereas a
French petit maitre is reckoned a complete$
figure every where, London not excepted
<PB N="99" REF="101">
Since it is &s;o much the humour of the Eng|li&s;h
at pre&s;ent to run abroad, I wi&s;h they
had antigallican &s;pirit enough to produce
them&s;elves in their own genuine Engli&s;h dre&s;s,
and treat the French modes with the &s;ame
philo&s;ophical contempt, which was &s;hewn by
an hone&s;t gentleman, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the
name of Wig-Middleton. That un&s;haken
patriot &s;till appears in the &s;ame kind of &s;cratch
perriwig, &s;kimming-di&s;h hat, and &s;lit &s;leeve,
which were worn five-and-twenty years ago,
and has invariably per&s;i&s;ted in this garb, in
defiance of all the revolutions of the mode.
I remember a &s;tudent in the temple, who,
after a long and learned inve&s;tigation of the
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or <HI>beautiful,</HI> had re&s;olution enough
to let his beard grow, and wore it in all pub|lic
places, until his heir at law applied
for a commi&s;&s;ion of lunacy again&s;t him;
then he &s;ubmitted to the razor, rather than
run any ri&s;que of being found <HI>non compos.</HI></P>
<P>Before I conclude, I mu&s;t tell you, that
the mo&s;t reputable &s;hop-keepers and trade&s;|men
of Paris think it no di&s;grace to practi&s;e
the mo&s;t &s;hameful impo&s;ition. I my&s;elf
know an in&s;tance of one of the mo&s;t credi|table
<PB N="100" REF="102">
<HI>marchands</HI> in this capital, who demanded
&s;ix francs an ell for &s;ome lute&s;tring, laying
his hand upon his brea&s;t at the &s;ame time,
and declaring <HI>en con&s;cience,</HI> that it had co&s;t
him within three &s;ols of the money. Yet
in, le&s;s than three minutes, he &s;old it for four
and a half, and when the buyer upbraided
him with his former declaration, he &s;hrugged
up his &s;houlders, &s;aying, <HI>il faut marchander.</HI>
I don't mention this as a particular in&s;tance.
The &s;ame mean di&s;ingenuity is univer&s;al all
over France, as I have been informed by &s;e|veral
per&s;ons of veracity.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER VII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Mrs. M&mdash;.
<DATELINE>Paris, <DATE>October 12, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Shall be much plea&s;ed if the remarks I
have made on the characters of the French
people, can afford you the &s;atisfaction you
require. With re&s;pect to the ladies, I can
only judge from their exteriors: but, indeed,
the&s;e are &s;o characteri&s;tic, that one can hard|ly
judge ami&s;s; unle&s;s we &s;uppo&s;e that a wo|man
of ta&s;te and &s;entiment may be &s;o over|ruled
by the ab&s;urdity of what is called fa&s;hion,
as to reject rea&s;on, and di&s;gui&s;e nature,
in order to become ridiculous or frightful.
That this may be the ca&s;e with &s;ome indivi|duals,
is very po&s;&s;ible. I have known it hap|pen
in our own country, where the follies
of the French are adopted, and exhibited in
the mo&s;t aukward imitation: but the gene|ral
prevalence of tho&s;e prepo&s;terous modes,
<PB N="102" REF="104">
is a plain proof that there is a general want
of ta&s;te, and a general depravity of nature.
I &s;hall not pretend to de&s;cribe the particulars
of a French lady's dre&s;s. The&s;e you are
much better acquainted with than I can pre|tend
to be: but this I will be bold to affirm,
that France is the general re&s;ervoir from
which all the ab&s;urdities of fal&s;e ta&s;te, lux|ury,
and extravagance have overflowed the
different kingdoms and &s;tates of Europe.
The &s;prings that fill this re&s;ervoir, are no other
than vanity and ignorance. It would be &s;u|perfluous
to attempt proving from the nature
of things, from the fir&s;t principles and u&s;e
of dre&s;s, as well as from the con&s;ideration of
natural beauty, and the practice of the an|cients,
who certainly under&s;tood it as well as
the connoi&s;&s;eurs of the&s;e days, that nothing
can be more mon&s;trous, inconvenient, and
contemptible, than the fa&s;hion of modern
drapery. You your&s;elf are well aware of all
its defects, and have often ridiculed them in
my hearing. I &s;hall only mention one parti|cular
of dre&s;s e&s;&s;ential to the fa&s;hion in this
country, which &s;eems to me to carry hu|man
affectation to the very farthe&s;t verge of
<PB N="103" REF="105">
folly and extravagance; that is, the manner
in which the faces of the ladies are primed
and painted. When the Indian chiefs were
in England every body ridiculed their pre|po&s;terous
method of painting their cheeks
and eye-lids; but this ridicule was wrong
placed. Tho&s;e critics ought to have con&s;i|dered,
that the Indians do not u&s;e paint to
make them&s;elves agreeable; but in order to
be the more terrible to their enemies. It is
generally &s;uppo&s;ed, I think, that your &s;ex
make u&s;e of <HI>fard</HI> and vermillion for very
different purpo&s;es; namely, to help a bad or
faded complexion, to heighten the graces,
or conceal the defects of nature, as well as
the ravages of time. I &s;hall not enquire at
pre&s;ent, whether it is ju&s;t and hone&s;t to im|po&s;e
in this manner on mankind: if it is not
hone&s;t, it may be allowed to be artful and po|litic,
and &s;hews, at lea&s;t, a de&s;ire of being
agreeable. But to lay it on as the fa&s;hion
in France pre&s;cribes to all the ladies of con|dition,
who indeed cannot appear without
this badge of di&s;tinction, is to di&s;gui&s;e them|&s;elves
in &s;uch a manner, as to render them
odious and dete&s;table to every &s;pectator, who
<PB N="104" REF="106">
has the lea&s;t reli&s;h left for nature and propriety.
As for the <HI>fard,</HI> or <HI>white,</HI> with which their
necks and &s;houlders are plai&s;tered, it may be
in &s;ome mea&s;ure excu&s;able, as their &s;kins are
naturally brown, or &s;allow; but the <HI>rouge,</HI>
which is daubed on their faces, from the chin
up to the eyes, without the lea&s;t art or dex|terity,
not only de&s;troys all di&s;tinction of fea|tures,
but renders the a&s;pect really frightful,
or at be&s;t conveys nothing but ideas of di&s;|gu&s;t
and aver&s;ion. You know, that without
this horrible ma&s;que no married lady is ad|mitted
at court, or in any polite a&s;&s;embly;
and that it is a mark of di&s;tinction which
no bourgeoi&s;e dare a&s;&s;ume. Ladies of fa&s;hion
only have the privilege of expo&s;ing them&s;elves
in the&s;e ungracious colours. As their faces
are concealed under a fal&s;e complexion, &s;o
their heads are covered with a va&s;t load of
fal&s;e hair, which is frizzled on the forehead,
&s;o as exactly to re&s;emble the wooly heads of
the Guinea negroes. As to the natural hue
of it, this is a matter of no con&s;equence,
for powder makes every head of hair of the
&s;ame colour; and no woman appears in this
country, from the moment &s;he ri&s;es till night,
<PB N="105" REF="107">
without being compleatly whitened. Pow|der
or meal was fir&s;t u&s;ed in Europe by the
Poles, to conceal their &s;cald heads; but the
pre&s;ent fa&s;hion of u&s;ing it, as well as the mo|di&s;h
method of dre&s;&s;ing the hair, mu&s;t have
been borrowed from the Hottentots, who
grea&s;e their wooly heads with mutton &s;uet,
and then pa&s;te it over with the powder called
<HI>buchu.</HI> In like manner, the hair of our fine
ladies is frizzled into the appearance of ne|groes
wool, and &s;tiffened with an abominable
pa&s;te of hog's grea&s;e, tallow, and white pow|der.
The pre&s;ent fa&s;hion, therefore, of paint|ing
the face, and adorning the head, adopted
by the beau monde in France, is taken from
tho&s;e two polite nations the Chicke&s;aws of
America and the Hottentots of Afric. On
the whole, when I &s;ee one of tho&s;e fine crea|tures
&s;ailing along, in her taudry robes of
&s;ilk and gauze, frilled, and flounced, and
furbelowed, with her fal&s;e locks, her fal&s;e
jewels, her paint, her patches, and perfumes;
I cannot help looking upon her as the vil|e&s;t
piece of &s;ophi&s;tication that art ever pro|duced.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108">
This hideous ma&s;que of painting, though
de&s;tructive of all beauty, is, however favour|able
to natural homeline&s;s and deformity.
It accu&s;toms the eyes of the other &s;ex, and
in time reconciles them to frightful objects;
it di&s;ables them from perceiving any di&s;tinc|tion
of features between woman and woman;
and, by reducing all faces to a level, gives e|very
female an equal chance for an admirer;
being in this particular analagous to the prac|tice
of the antient Lacedemonians, who
were obliged to chu&s;e their help-mates in the
dark. In what manner the in&s;ides of their
heads are furni&s;hed, I would not pre&s;ume to
judge from the conver&s;ation of a very few
to whom I have had acce&s;s: but from the na|ture
of their education, which I have heard
de&s;cribed, and the natural vivacity of their
tempers, I &s;hould expect neither &s;en&s;e, &s;en|timent,
nor di&s;cretion. From the nur&s;ery
they are allowed, and even encouraged, to &s;ay
every thing that comes uppermo&s;t; by which
means they acquire a volubility of tongue,
and a &s;et of phra&s;es, which con&s;titutes what
is called polite conver&s;ation. At the &s;ame time
they obtain an ab&s;olute conque&s;t over all
<PB N="107" REF="109">
&s;en&s;e of &s;hame, or rather, they avoid acquir|ing
this trouble&s;ome &s;en&s;ation; for it is cer|tainly
no innate idea. Tho&s;e who have not
governe&s;&s;es at home, are &s;ent, for a few
years, to a convent, where they lay in a fund
of &s;uper&s;tition that &s;erves them for life: but
I never heard they had the lea&s;t opportunity
of cultivating the mind, of exerci&s;ing the
powers of rea&s;on, or of imbibing a ta&s;te for
letters, or any rational or u&s;eful accompli&s;h|ment.
After being taught to prattle, to dance
and play at cards, they are deemed &s;uffici|ently
qualified to appear in the <HI>grand monde,</HI>
and to perform all the duties of that high
rank and &s;tation in life. In mentioning cards,
I ought to ob&s;erve, that they learn to play
not barely for amu&s;ement, but al&s;o with a
view to advantage; and, indeed, you &s;eldom
meet with a native of France, whether male
or female, who is not a compleat game&s;ter,
well ver&s;ed in all the &s;ubtleties and fine&s;&s;es of
the art. This is likewi&s;e the ca&s;e all over
Italy. A lady of a great hou&s;e in Piedmont,
having four &s;ons, makes no &s;cruple to de|clare,
that the fir&s;t &s;hall repre&s;ent the fami|ly,
the &s;econd enter into the army, the third
<PB N="108" REF="110">
into the church, and that &s;he will breed
the fourth a game&s;ter. The&s;e noble adven|turers
devote them&s;elves in a particular man|ner
to the entertainment of travellers from
our country, becau&s;e the Engli&s;h are &s;uppo&s;ed
to be full of money, ra&s;h, incautious, and
utterly ignorant of play. But &s;uch a &s;har|per
is mo&s;t dangerous, when he hunts in
couple with a female. I have known a
French count and his wife, who found means
to lay the mo&s;t wary under contribution.
He was &s;mooth, &s;upple, officious, and atten|tive:
&s;he was young, hand&s;ome, unprinci|pled,
and artful. If the Engli&s;hman marked
for prey was found upon his guard again&s;t
the de&s;igns of the hu&s;band, then madam
plied him on the &s;ide of gallantry. She di&s;|played
all the attractions of her per&s;on. She
&s;ung, danced, ogled, &s;ighed, complimented,
and complained. If he was in&s;en&s;ible to all her
charms, &s;he flattered his vanity, and piqued
his pride, by extolling the wealth and gene|ro&s;ity
of the Engli&s;h; and if he proved
deaf to all the&s;e in&s;inuations, &s;he, as her la&s;t
&s;take, endeavoured to intere&s;t his humanity
and compa&s;&s;ion. She expatiated, with tears
<PB N="109" REF="111">
in her eyes, on the cruelty and indifference
of her great relations; repre&s;ented that her
hu&s;band was no more than the cadet of a
noble family; that his provi&s;ion was by no
means &s;uitable, either to the dignity of his
rank, or the genero&s;ity of his di&s;po&s;ition:
that he had a law-&s;uit of great con&s;equence
depending, which had drained all his fi|nances;
and, finally, that they &s;hould be
both ruined, if they could not find &s;ome ge|nerous
friend, who would accommodate them
with a &s;um of money to bring the cau&s;e to
a determination. Tho&s;e who are not actu|ated
by &s;uch &s;candalous motives, become
game&s;ters from meer habit, and, having no|thing
more &s;olid to engage their thoughts, or
employ their time, con&s;ume the be&s;t part of
their lives, in this wor&s;t of all di&s;&s;ipation.
I am not ignorant that there are exceptions
from this general rule: I know that France
has produced a Maintenon, a Sevign&ecirc;, a Scu|$eri,
a Dacier, and a Chatelet; but I would
no more deduce the general character of the
French ladies from the&s;e examples, than I
would call a field of hemp a flower-gar|den,
becau&s;e there might be in it a few <HI>lillies</HI>
<PB N="110" REF="112">
or <HI>renunculas</HI> planted by the hand of acci|dent.</P>
<P>Woman has been defined a weaker man;
but in this country the men are, in my opi|nion,
more ridiculous and in&s;ignificant than
the women. They certainly are more di&s;a|greeable
to a rational enquirer, becau&s;e they
are more trouble&s;ome. Of all the coxcombs
on the face of the earth, a French <HI>petit mai|tre</HI>
is the mo&s;t impertinent: and they are all
<HI>petit maitres,</HI> from the marquis who glitters
in lace and embroidery, to the <HI>gar&ccedil;on bar|bier</HI>
covered with meal, who &s;truts with his
hair in a long queue, and his hat under his
arm. I have already ob&s;erved, that vanity is
the great and univer&s;al mover among all ranks
and degrees of people in this nation; and as
they take no pains to conceal or controul it
they are hurried by it into the mo&s;t ridicu|lous
and indeed intolerable extravagance.</P>
<P>When I talk of the French nation, I mu&s;t
again except a great number of individuals
from the general cen&s;ure. Though I have $
hearty contempt for the ignorance, folly, and
pre&s;umption which characteri&s;e the generali+ty,
I cannot but re&s;pect the talents of man
<PB N="111" REF="113">
great men, who have eminently di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
them&s;elves in every art and &s;cience:
the&s;e I &s;hall always revere and e&s;teem as crea|tures
of a &s;uperior &s;pecies, produced, for the
wi&s;e purpo&s;es of providence, among the re|fu&s;e
of mankind. It would be ab&s;urd to con|clude
that the Welch or Highlanders are a
gigantic people, becau&s;e tho&s;e mountains may
have produced a few individuals near &s;even
feet high. It would be equally ab&s;urd to
&s;uppo&s;e the French are a nation of philo&s;o|phers,
becau&s;e France has given birth to a
Des Cartes, a Maupertuis, a Reaumur, and
a Buffon.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not even deny, that the French are
by no means deficient in natural capacity;
but they are at the &s;ame time remarkable
for a natural levity, which hinders their
youth from cultivating that capacity. This
is reinforced by the mo&s;t prepo&s;terous educa|tion,
and the example of a giddy people,
engaged in the mo&s;t frivolous pur&s;uits. A
Frenchman is by &s;ome Je&s;uit, or other monk,
taught to read his mother tongue, and to &s;ay
his prayers in a language he does not under|&s;tand.
He learns to dance and to fence, by
<PB N="112" REF="114">
the ma&s;ters of tho&s;e noble &s;ciences. He be|comes
a compleat connoi&s;&s;eur in dre&s;&s;ing hair,
and in adorning his own per&s;on, under the
hands and in&s;tructions of his barber and
valet de chambre. If he learns to play up|on
the flute or the fiddle, he is altogether ir|re&s;i&s;tible.
But he piques him&s;elf upon being
poli&s;hed above the natives of any other coun|try
by his conver&s;ation with the fair &s;ex. In
the cour&s;e of this communication, with which
he is indulged from his tender years, he learns
like a parrot, by rote, the whole circle of
French compliments, which you know are a
&s;et of phra&s;es, ridiculous even to a proverb;
and the&s;e he throws out indi&s;criminately to
all women, without di&s;tinction, in the exer|ci&s;e
of that kind of addre&s;s, which is here
di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of gallantry: it
is no more than his making love to every wo|man
who will give him the hearing. It is
an exerci&s;e, by the repetition of which he
becomes very pert, very familiar, and very
impertinent. Mode&s;ty, or diffidence, I have
already &s;aid, is utterly unknown among them,
and therefore I wonder there &s;hould be a term
to expre&s;s it in their language.</P>
<P><PB N="113" REF="115">
If I was obliged to define politene&s;s, I
&s;hould call it, the art of making one's &s;elf
agreeable. I think it an art that nece&s;&s;arily
implies a &s;en&s;e of decorum, and a delicacy
of &s;entiment. The&s;e are qualities, of which
(as far as I have been able to ob&s;erve) a
Frenchman has no idea; therefore he never
can be deemed polite, except by tho&s;e per|&s;ons
among whom they are as little under|&s;tood.
His fir&s;t aim is to adorn his own per|&s;on
with what he calls fine cloaths, that is
the frippery of the fa&s;hion. It is no wonder
that the heart of a female, unimproved by
rea&s;on, and untinctured with natural good
&s;en&s;e, &s;hould flutter at the &s;ight of &s;uch a
gaudy thing, among the number of her ad|mirers:
this impre&s;&s;ion is enforced by fu&s;tian
compliments, which her own vanity inter|prets
in a literal &s;en&s;e, and &s;till more con|firmed
by the a&s;&s;iduous attention of the gal|lant,
who, indeed, has nothing el&s;e to mind.
A Frenchman in con&s;equence of his mingling
with the females from his infancy, not only
becomes acquainted with all their cu&s;toms
and humours; but grows wonderfully alert
in performing a thou&s;and little offices, which
<PB N="114" REF="116">
are overlooked by other men, who&s;e time hath
been &s;pent in making more valuable acqui&s;i|tions.
He enters, without ceremony, a la|dy's
bed-chamber, while &s;he is in bed, reaches
her whatever &s;he wants, airs her &s;hift, and
helps to put it on. He attends at her toi|lette,
regulates the di&s;tribution of her patches,
and advi&s;es where to lay on the paint. If he
vi&s;its her when &s;he is dre&s;&s;ed, and perceives
the lea&s;t impropriety in her <HI>coeffure,</HI> he in&s;i&s;ts
upon adju&s;ting it with his own hands: if
he &s;ees a curl, or even a &s;ingle hair ami&s;s,
he produces his comb, his &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and
pomatum, and &s;ets it to rights with the
dexterity of a profe&s;&s;ed <HI>fri&s;eur.</HI> He &s;quires
her to every place &s;he vi&s;its, either on bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
or plea&s;ure; and, by dedicating his
whole time to her, renders him&s;elf nece&s;&s;ary
to her occa&s;ions. This I take to be the mo&s;t
agreeable &s;ide of his character: let us view
him on the quarter of impertinence. A French|man
pries into all your &s;ecrets with the mo&s;t
impudent and importunate curio&s;ity, and then
di&s;clo&s;es them without remor&s;e. If you are
indi&s;po&s;ed, he que&s;tions you about the &s;ymp|toms
of your di&s;order, with more freedom
<PB N="115" REF="117">
than your phy&s;ician would pre&s;ume to u&s;e;
very often in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t terms. He then
propo&s;es his remedy (for they are all quacks)
he prepares it without your knowledge, and
worries you with &s;olicitation to take it, with|out
paying the lea&s;t regard to the opinion of
tho&s;e whom you have cho&s;en to take care of
your health. Let you be ever &s;o ill, or a|ver&s;e
to company, he forces him&s;elf at all
times into your bed-chamber, and if it is ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to give him a peremptory refu&s;al, he
is affronted. I have known one of tho&s;e pe|tit
maitres in&s;i&s;t upon paying regular vi&s;its
twice a day to a poor gentleman who was
delirious; and he conver&s;ed with him on
different &s;ubjects, till he was in his la&s;t ago|nies.
This attendance is not the effect of at|tachment,
or regard, but of &s;heer vanity,
that he may afterwards boa&s;t of his charity
and humane di&s;po&s;ition: though, of all the
people I have ever known, I think the French
are the lea&s;t capable of feeling for the di&s;tre&s;|&s;es
of their fellow creatures. Their hearts
are not &s;u&s;ceptible of deep impre&s;&s;ions; and,
&s;uch is their levity, that the imagination has
not time to brood long over any di&s;agree|able
<PB N="116" REF="118">
idea, or &s;en&s;ation. As a Frenchman
piques him&s;elf on his gallantry, he no &s;ooner
makes a conque&s;t of a female's heart, than
he expo&s;es her character, for the gratification
of his vanity. Nay, if he &s;hould mi&s;carry
in his &s;chemes, he will forge letters and &s;to|ries,
to the ruin of the lady's reputation.
This is a &s;pecies of perfidy which one would
think &s;hould render them odious and dete&s;t|able
to the whole &s;ex; but the ca&s;e is other|wi&s;e.
I beg your pardon, Madam; but wo|men
are never better plea&s;ed, than when they
&s;ee one another expo&s;ed; and every individual
has &s;uch confidence in her own &s;uperior
charms and di&s;cretion, that &s;he thinks &s;he
can fix the mo&s;t volatile, and reform the mo&s;t
treacherous lover.</P>
<P>If a Frenchman is admitted into your fa|mily,
and di&s;tingui&s;hed by repeated marks
of your friend&s;hip and regard, the fir&s;t re|turn
he makes for your civilities is to make
love to your wife, if &s;he is hand&s;ome; if not,
to your &s;i&s;ter, or daughter, or niece. If he
&s;uffers a repul&s;e from your wife, or attempts
in vain to debauch your &s;i&s;ter, or your daugh|ter,
or your niece, he will, rather than not
<PB N="117" REF="119">
play the traitor with his gallantry, make his
addre&s;&s;es to your grandmother; and ten to
one, but in one &s;hape or another, he will
find means to ruin the peace of a family, in
which he has been &s;o kindly entertained. What
he cannot accompli&s;h by dint of compliment,
and per&s;onal attendance, he will endeavour
to effect, by reinforcing the&s;e with billets-doux,
&s;ongs, and ver&s;es, of which he always
makes a provi&s;ion for &s;uch purpo&s;es. If he is
detected in the&s;e efforts of treachery, and re|proached
with his ingratitude, he impudent|ly
declares, that what he had done was no
more than &s;imple gallanry, con&s;idered in
France as an indi&s;pen&s;ible duty on every man
who pretended to good breeding. Nay, he
will even affirm, that his endeavours to cor|rupt
your wife, or deflower your daughter,
were the mo&s;t genuine proofs he could give
of his particular regard for your family.</P>
<P>If a Frenchman is capable of real friend|&s;hip,
it mu&s;t certainly be the mo&s;t di&s;agree|able
pre&s;ent he can po&s;&s;ibly make to a man of
a true Engli&s;h character. You know, Ma|dam,
we are naturally taciturn, &s;oon tired of
impertinence, and much &s;ubject to fits of
<PB N="118" REF="120">
di&s;gu&s;t. Your French friend intrudes upon
you at all hours: he &s;tuns you with his lo|quacity:
he tea&s;es you with impertinent
que&s;tions about your dome&s;tic and private
affairs: he attempts to meddle in all your
concerns; and forces his advice upon you
with the mo&s;t unwearied importunity: he
a&s;ks the price of every thing you wear, and,
&s;o &s;ure as you tell him, undervalues it,
without he&s;itation: he affirms it is in
a bad ta&s;te, ill-contrived, ill-made; that
you have been impo&s;ed upon both with re|&s;pect
to the fa&s;hion and the price; that the
marqui&s;e of this, or the counte&s;s of that,
has one that is perfectly elegant, quite in the
<HI>b$n ton,</HI> and yet it co&s;t her little more than
you gave for a thing that nobody would
wear.</P>
<P>If there were five hundred di&s;hes at table,
a Frenchman will eat of all of them, and
then complain he has no appetite. This I
have &s;everal times remarked. A friend of mine
gained a con&s;iderable wager upon an experi|ment
of this kind: the petit maitre ate of
fourteen different <HI>plats,</HI> be&s;ides the de&s;ert;
then di&s;paraged the cook, declaring he was
<PB N="119" REF="121">
he was no better than a <HI>marmiton,</HI> or turn|&s;pit.</P>
<P>The French have a mo&s;t riduculous fond|ne&s;s
for their hair, and this I believe they
inherit from their remote ance&s;tors. The fir&s;t
race of French kings were di&s;tingui&s;hed by
their long hair, and certainly the people of
this country con&s;ider it as an indi&s;pen&s;ible
ornament. A Frenchman will &s;ooner part
with his religion than with his hair, which,
indeed, no con&s;ideration will induce him to
forego. I know a gentleman afflicted with a
continual head-ach, and a defluxion on his
eyes, who was told by his phy&s;ician that the
be&s;t chance he had for being cured, would be
to have his head clo&s;e &s;haved, and bathed e|very
day in cold water. &startq;How (cried he)
cut my hair? Mr. Doctor, your mo&s;t hum|ble
&s;ervant!&endq; He di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his phy&s;ician,
lo&s;t his eye-&s;ight, and almo&s;t his &s;en&s;es, and
is now led about with his hair in a bag, and
a piece of green &s;ilk hanging like a &s;creen be|fore
his face. Count Saxe, and other mili|tary
writers, have demon&s;trated the ab&s;urdity
of a &s;oldier's wearing a long head of hair;
neverthele&s;s, every &s;oldier in this country wears
<PB N="120" REF="122">
a long queue, which makes a delicate mark
on his white cloathing; and this ridiculous
foppery has de&s;cended even to the lowe&s;t cla&s;s
of people. The <HI>decrotteur,</HI> who cleans your
&s;hoes at the corner of the Pont Neuf, has a
tail of this kind hanging down to his rump,
and even the pea&s;ant who drives an a&s;s loaded
with dung, wears his hair <HI>en queue,</HI> though,
perhaps, he has neither &s;hirt nor breeches.
This is the ornament upon which he be&s;tows
much time and pains, and in the exhibition
of which he finds full gratification for his
vanity. Con&s;idering the har&s;h features of the
common people in this country, their dimi|nutive
&s;tature, their grimaces, and that long
appendage, they have no &s;mall re&s;emblance
to large baboons walking upright; and per|haps
this &s;imilitude has helped to entail upon
them the ridicule of their neighbours.</P>
<P>A French friend tires out your patience
with long vi&s;its; and, far from taking the
mo&s;t palpable hints to withdraw, when he
perceives you unea&s;y, he ob&s;erves you are low|&s;pirited,
and therefore declares he will keep
you company. This per&s;everance &s;hews that
he mu&s;t either be void of all penetration, or
<PB N="121" REF="123">
that his di&s;po&s;ition mu&s;t be truly diabolical.
Rather than be tormented with &s;uch a fiend,
a man had better turn him out of doors,
even though at the hazard of being run thro'
the body.</P>
<P>The French are generally counted in&s;in|cere,
and taxed with want of genero&s;ity.
But I think the&s;e reproaches are not well
founded. High-flown profe&s;&s;ions of friend|&s;hip
and attachment con&s;titute the language
of common compliment in this country, and
are never &s;uppo&s;ed to be under&s;tood in the
literal acceptation of the words; and, if
their acts of genero&s;ity are but very rare, we
ought to a&s;cribe that rarity, not &s;o much to
a deficiency of generous &s;entiments, as to
their vanity and o&s;tentation, which engro&s;|&s;ing
all their funds, utterly di&s;able them from
exerting the virtues of beneficence. Vanity,
indeed, predominates among all ranks, to
&s;uch a degree, that they are the greate&s;t <HI>ego|ti&s;ts</HI>
in the world; and the mo&s;t in&s;ignificant
individual talks in company with the &s;ame
conceit and arrogance, as a per&s;on of the
greate&s;t importance. Neither con&s;cious po|verty
nor di&s;grace will re&s;train him in the
<PB N="122" REF="124">
lea&s;t either from a&s;&s;uming his full &s;hare of
the conver&s;ation, or making his addre&s;&s;es to
the fine&s;t lady, whom he has the &s;malle&s;t op|portunity
to approach: nor is he re&s;trained
by any other con&s;ideration what&s;oever. It
is all one to him whether he him&s;elf has a
wife of his own, or the lady a hu&s;band;
whether &s;he is de&s;igned for the cloi&s;ter, or
pre-ingaged to his be&s;t friend and benefac|tor.
He takes it for granted that his addre&s;|&s;es
cannot but be acceptable; and, if he
meets with a repul&s;e, he condemns her ta&s;te;
but never doubts his own qualifications.</P>
<P>I have a great many things to &s;ay of their
military character, and their punctilios of
honour, which la&s;t are equally ab&s;urd and
pernicious; but as this letter has run to an
uncon&s;cionable length, I &s;hall defer them till

<HEAD>LETTER VIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER>To Mr. M&mdash;.
<DATELINE>Lyons, <DATE>October 19, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Was favoured with yours at Paris, and
look upon your reproaches as the proof
of your friend&s;hip. The truth is, I con&s;i|dered
all the letters I have hitherto written
on the &s;ubject of my travels, as written to
your &s;ociety in general, though they have
been addre&s;&s;ed to one individual of it; and
if they contain any thing that can either a|mu&s;e
or inform, I de&s;ire that henceforth all
I &s;end may be freely peru&s;ed by all the mem|bers.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to my health, about which
you &s;o kindly enquire, I have nothing new
to communicate. I had rea&s;on to think that
my bathing in the &s;ea at Boulogne produced
a good effect, in &s;trengthening my relaxed
fibres. You know how &s;ubject I was to colds
<PB N="124" REF="126">
in England; that I could not &s;tir abroad af|ter
&s;un-&s;et, nor expo&s;e my&s;elf to the &s;malle&s;t
damp, nor walk till the lea&s;t moi&s;ture ap|peared
on my &s;kin, without being laid up
for ten days or a fortnight. At Paris, how|ever,
I went out every day, with my hat un|der
my arm, though the weather was wet
and cold: I walked in the garden at Ver&s;ailles
even after it was dark, with my head unco|vered,
on a cold evening, when the ground
was far from being dry: nay, at Marli, I
&s;auntered above a mile through damp alleys,
and wet gra&s;s: and from none of the&s;e
ri&s;ques did I feel the lea&s;t inconvenience.</P>
<P>In one of our excur&s;ions we vi&s;ited the
manufacture for porcelain, which the king of
France has e&s;tabli&s;hed at the village of St.
Cloud, on the road to Ver&s;ailles, and which
is, indeed, a noble monument of his muni|ficence.
It is a very large building, both
commodious and magnificent, where a great
number of arti&s;ts are employed, and where
this elegant &s;uperfluity is carried to as great
perfection as it ever was at Dre&s;den. Yet,
after all, I know not whether the porcelain
made at Chel&s;ea may not vie with the pro|ductions
<PB N="125" REF="127">
either of Dre&s;den, or St. Cloud. If
it falls &s;hort of either, it is not in the de&s;ign,
painting, enamel, or other ornaments, but
only in the compo&s;ition of the metal, and
the method of managing it in the furnace.
Our porcelain &s;eems to be a partial vitrifica|tion
of levigated flint and fine pipe clay,
mixed together in a certain proportion; and
if the pieces are not removed from the fire
in the very critical moment, they will be ei|ther
too little, or too much vitrified. In the
fir&s;t ca&s;e, I apprehend they will not acquire a
proper degree of cohe&s;ion; they will be apt
to be corroded, di&s;coloured, and to crumble,
like the fir&s;t e&s;&s;ays that were made at Chel|&s;ea;
in the &s;econd ca&s;e, they will be little
better than imperfect gla&s;s.</P>
<P>There are three methods of travelling from
Paris to Lyons, which, by the &s;horte&s;t road
is a journey of about three hundred and
&s;ixty miles. One is by the <HI>diligence,</HI> or &s;tage|coach,
which performs it in five days; and
every pa&s;&s;enger pays one hundred livres, in
con&s;ideration of which, he not only has a
&s;eat in the carriage, but is maintained on the
road. The inconveniences attending this
<PB N="126" REF="128">
way of travelling are the&s;e. You are croud|ed
into the carriage, to the number of eight
per&s;ons, &s;o as to &s;it very unea&s;y, and &s;ome|times
run the ri&s;que of being &s;tifled among
very indifferent company. You are hurried
out of bed, at four, three, nay often at
two o'clock in the morning. You are o|bliged
to eat in the French way, which is
very di&s;agreeable to an Engli&s;h palate; and,
at Chalons, you mu&s;t embark upon the Soane
in a boat, which conveys you to Lyons, &s;o
that the two la&s;t days of your journey are
by water. All the&s;e were in&s;urmountable ob|jections
to me, who am in &s;uch a bad &s;tate
of health, troubled with an a&s;thmatic cough,
&s;pitting, &s;low fever, and re&s;tle&s;&s;ne&s;s, which
demands a continual change of place, as well
as free air, and room for motion. I was
this day vi&s;ited by two young gentlemen, &s;ons
of Mr. Gua&s;taldi, late mini&s;ter from Genoa
at London. I had &s;een them at Paris, at the
hou&s;e of the dutche&s;s of Douglas. They
came hither, with their conductor, in the
<HI>diligence,</HI> and a&s;&s;ured me, that nothing could
be more di&s;agreeable than their &s;ituation in
that carriage.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="129">
Another way of travelling in this country
is to hire a coach and four hor&s;es; and this
method I was inclined to take: but when I
went to the bureau, where alone the&s;e voitures
are to be had, I was given to under&s;tand,
that it would co&s;t me &s;ix-and-twenty guineas,
and travel &s;o &s;low that I &s;hould be ten days
upon the road. The&s;e carriages are let by
the &s;ame per&s;ons who farm the diligence;
and for this they have an exclu&s;ive privilege,
which makes them very &s;aucy and in&s;olent.
When I mentioned my &s;ervant, they gave
me to under&s;tand, that I mu&s;t pay two loui'|dores
more for his &s;eat upon the coach box.
As I could not reli&s;h the&s;e terms, nor brook
the thoughts of being &s;o long upon the road,
I had recour&s;e to the third method, which is
going po&s;t.</P>
<P>In England you know I &s;hould have had
nothing to do, but to hire a couple of po&s;t|chai&s;es
from &s;tage to &s;tage, with two hor&s;es
in each; but here the ca&s;e is quite otherwi&s;e.
The po&s;t is farmed from the king, who lays
travellers under contribution for his own be|nefit,
and has publi&s;hed a &s;et of oppre&s;&s;ive
ordonnances, which no &s;tranger nor native
<PB N="128" REF="130">
dares tran&s;gre&s;s. The po&s;tma&s;ter finds no|thing
but hor&s;es and guides: the carriage
you your&s;elf mu&s;t provide. If there are
four per&s;ons within the carriage, you are o|bliged
to have &s;ix hor&s;es, and two po&s;tilli|ons;
and if your &s;ervant &s;its on the out&s;ide,
either before or behind, you mu&s;t pay for a
&s;eventh. You pay double for the fir&s;t &s;tage
from Paris, and twice double for pa&s;&s;ing
through Fontainbleau when the court is there,
as well as at coming to Lyons, and at leav|ing
this city. The&s;e are called royal po&s;ts
and are undoubtedly a &s;candalous impo&s;i|tion.</P>
<P>There are two po&s;t roads from Paris to
Lyons, one of &s;ixty-five po&s;ts, by the way of
Moulins; the other of fifty-nine, by the way
of Dijon in Burgundy. This la&s;t I cho&s;e
partly to &s;ave &s;ixty livres, and partly to &s;e$
the wine harve&s;t of Burgundy, which, I wa$
told, was a &s;ea&s;on of mirth and jollity among
all ranks of people. I hired a very good
coach for ten loui'dores to Lyons, and &s;et out
from Paris on the thirteenth in&s;tant, with &s;i$
hor&s;es, two po&s;tillions, and my own &s;erva$$
on hor&s;eback. We made no &s;top at Fontain|bleau,
<PB N="129" REF="131">
though the court was there; but lay
at Moret, which is one &s;tage further, a very
paltry little town; where, however, we found
good accommodation.</P>
<P>I &s;hall not pretend to de&s;cribe the ca&s;tle or
palace of Fountainbleau, of which I had
only a glimp&s;e in pa&s;&s;ing; but the fore&s;t, in
the middle of which it &s;tands, is a noble
chace of great extent, beautifully wild and
romantic, well &s;tored with game of all &s;orts,
and abounding with excellent timber. It put
me in mind of the New Fore&s;t in Hamp|&s;hire;
but the hills, rocks, and mountains,
with which it is diver&s;ified, render it more
agreeable.</P>
<P>The people of this country dine at noon,
and travellers always find an ordinary pre|pared
at every <HI>auberge,</HI> or public-hou&s;e, on
the road. Here they &s;it down promi&s;cuou&s;ly,
and dine at &s;o much a head. The u&s;ual price
is thirty &s;ols for dinner, and forty for &s;up|per,
including lodging; for this moderate
expence they have two cour&s;es and a de&s;ert.
If you eat in your own apartment, you pay,
in&s;tead of forty &s;ols, three, and in &s;ome
places, four livres a head. I and my family
<PB N="130" REF="132">
could not well di&s;pen&s;e with our tea and toa&s;t
in the morning, and had no &s;tomach to eat
at noon. For my own part, I hate the French
cookery, and abominate garlick, with which
all their ragouts, in this part of the coun|try,
are highly &s;ea&s;oned: we therefore formed
a different plan of living upon the road. Be|fore
we left Paris, we laid in a &s;tock of tea,
chocolate, cured neats tongues, and <HI>&s;auci&s;&s;ons,</HI>
or Bologna &s;au&s;ages, both of which we found
in great perfection in that capital, where, in|deed,
there are excellent provi&s;ions of all
&s;orts. About ten in the morning we &s;top|ped
to breakfa&s;t at &s;ome auberge, where we
always found bread, butter, and milk. In
the mean time, we ordered a <HI>poulard</HI> or two to
be roa&s;ted, and the&s;e, wrapped in a napkin,
were put into the boot of the coach, toge|ther
with bread, wine, and water. About
two or three in the afternoon, while the
hor&s;es were changing, we laid a cloth upon
our knees, and producing our &s;tore, with a
few earthen plates, di&s;cu&s;&s;ed our &s;hort meal
without further ceremony. This was followed
by a de&s;ert of grapes and other fruit, which
we had al&s;o provided. I mu&s;t own I found
<PB N="131" REF="133">
the&s;e tran&s;ient refre&s;hments much more a|greeable
than any regular meal I ate upon the
road. The wine commonly u&s;ed in Burgun|dy
is &s;o weak and thin, that you would not
drink it in England. The very be&s;t which
they &s;ell at Dijon, the capital of the province,
for three livres a bottle, is in &s;trength, and
even in flavour, greatly inferior to what I have
drank in London. I believe all the fir&s;t
growth is either con&s;umed in the hou&s;es of
the noble&s;&s;e, or &s;ent abroad to foreign mar|kets.
I have drank excellent Burgundy at
Bru&s;&s;els for a florin a bottle; that is, little
more than twenty pence &s;terling.</P>
<P>The country from the fore&s;t of Fountain|bleau
to the Lyonnois, through which we
pa&s;&s;ed, is rather agreeable than fertile, being
part of Champagne and the dutchy of Bur|gundy,
watered by three plea&s;ant pa&s;toral ri|vers,
the Seine, the Yonne, and the Soane.
The flat country is laid out chiefly for corn;
but produces more rye than wheat. Almo&s;t
all the ground &s;eems to be ploughed up, &s;o
that there is little or nothing lying fallow.
There are very few inclo&s;ures, &s;carce any
meadow ground, and, &s;o far as I could ob|&s;erve,
<PB N="132" REF="134">
a great &s;carcity of cattle. We &s;ome|times
found it very difficult to procure half
a pint of milk for our tea. In Burgundy I
&s;aw a pea&s;ant ploughing the ground with a
jack-a&s;s, a lean cow, and a he-goat, yoked
together. It is generally ob&s;erved, that a
great number of black cattle are bred and
fed on the mountains of Burgundy, which
are the highe&s;t lands in France; but I &s;aw
very few. The pea&s;ants in France are &s;o
wretchedly poor, and &s;o much oppre&s;&s;ed by
their landlords, that they cannot afford to
inclo&s;e their grounds, or give a proper re|&s;pite
to their lands; or to &s;tock their farms
with a &s;ufficient number of black cattle to
produce the nece&s;&s;ary manure, without which
agriculture can never be carried to any de|gree
of perfection. Indeed, whatever efforts
a few individuals may make for the benefit
of their own e&s;tates, hu&s;bandry in France
will never be generally improved, until the
farmer is free and independent.</P>
<P>From the frequency of towns and villages,
I &s;hould imagine this country is very popu|lous;
yet it mu&s;t be owned, that the towns
are in general thinly inhabited. I &s;aw a good
<PB N="133" REF="135">
number of country &s;eats and plantations
near the banks of the rivers, on each &s;ide;
and a great many convents, &s;weetly &s;ituated,
on ri&s;ing grounds, where the air is mo&s;t
pure, and the pro&s;pect mo&s;t agreeable. It
is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee how happy the founders
of tho&s;e religious hou&s;es have been in their
choice of &s;ituations, all the world over.</P>
<P>In pa&s;&s;ing through this country, I was very
much &s;truck with the &s;ight of large ripe
clu&s;ters of grapes, entwined with the briars
and thorns of common hedges on the way|&s;ide.
The mountains of Burgundy are co|vered
with vines from the bottom to the top,
and &s;eem to be rai&s;ed by nature on purpo&s;e
to extend the &s;urface, and to expo&s;e it the
more advantageou&s;ly to the rays of the &s;un.
The <HI>vandange</HI> was but ju&s;t begun, and the
people were employed in gathering the
grapes; but I &s;aw no &s;igns of fe&s;tivity among
them. Perhaps their joy was a little damped
by the bad pro&s;pect of their harve&s;t; for
they complained that the weather had been &s;o
unfavourable as to hinder the grapes from
ripening. I thought, indeed, there was &s;ome|thing
uncomfortable in &s;eeing the vintage
<PB N="134" REF="136">
thus retarded till the beginning of winter:
for, in &s;ome parts, I found the weather ex|tremely
cold; particularly at a place called
Mai&s;on-neuve, where we lay, there was a hard
fro&s;t, and in the morning the pools were co|vered
with a thick cru&s;t of ice. My per&s;o|nal
adventures on the road were &s;uch as
will not bear a recital. They con&s;i&s;ted of
petty di&s;putes with landladies, po&s;t-ma&s;ters,
and po&s;tilions. The highways &s;eem to be
perfectly &s;afe. We did not find that any
robberies were ever committed, although we
did not &s;ee one of the <HI>marechau&s;&s;e</HI> from Paris
to Lyons. You know the <HI>marechau&s;&s;e</HI> are a
body of troopers well mounted, maintained
in France as &s;afe-guards to the public roads.
It is a reproach upon England that &s;ome &s;uch
patrol is not appointed for the protection of
travellers.</P>
<P>At Sens in Champagne, my &s;ervant, who
had rode on before to be&s;peak fre&s;h hor&s;es,
told me, that the dome&s;tic of another com|pany
had been provided before him, altho'
it was not his turn, as he had arrived later at
the po&s;t. Provoked at this partiality, I re|&s;olved
to chide the po&s;t-ma&s;ter, and accord|ingly
<PB N="135" REF="137">
addre&s;&s;ed my&s;elf to a per&s;on who &s;tood
at the door of the auberge. He was a jolly
figure, fat and fair, dre&s;&s;ed in an odd kind
of garb, with a gold laced cap on his head,
and a cambric handkerchief pinned to his
middle. The &s;ight of &s;uch a fanta&s;tic petit
maitre, in the character of a po&s;t-ma&s;ter, in|crea&s;ed
my &s;pleen. I called to him with an
air of authority, mixed with indignation,
and when he came up to the coach, a&s;ked in
a peremptory tone, if he did not under|&s;tand
the king's ordonnance concerning the
regulation of the po&s;ts? He laid his hand
upon his brea&s;t; but before he could make
any an&s;wer, I pulled out the po&s;t-book, and
began to read, with great vociferation, the
article which orders, that the traveller who
comes fir&s;t &s;hall be fir&s;t &s;erved. By this time
the fre&s;h hor&s;es being put to the carriage,
and the po&s;tilions mounted, the coach &s;et
off all of a &s;udden, with uncommon &s;peed.
I imagined the po&s;t-ma&s;ter had given the fel|lows
a &s;ignal to be gone, and, in this per&s;ua|&s;ion,
thru&s;ting my head out at the window,
I be&s;towed &s;ome epithets upon him, which
mu&s;t have &s;ounded very har&s;h in the ears of
<PB N="136" REF="138">
a Frenchman. We &s;topped for a refre&s;h|ment
at a little town called Joigne-ville, where
(by the bye) I was &s;candalou&s;ly impo&s;ed up|on,
and even abu&s;ed by a virago of a land|lady;
then proceeding to the next &s;tage, I
was given to under&s;tand we could not be &s;up|plied
with fre&s;h hor&s;es. Here I perceived at the
door of the inn, the &s;ame per&s;on whom I had
reproached at Sens. He came up to the coach,
and told me, that notwith&s;tanding what the
guides had &s;aid, I &s;hould have fre&s;h hor&s;es
in a few minutes. I imagined he was ma&s;|ter
both of this hou&s;e and the auberge at
Sens, between which he pa&s;&s;ed and repa&s;&s;ed
occa&s;ionally; and that he was now de&s;irous
of making me amends for the affront he
had put upon me at the other place. Ob|&s;erving
that one of the trunks behind was
a little di&s;placed, he a&s;&s;i&s;ted my &s;ervant in
adju&s;ting it: then he entered into conver&s;a|tion
with me, and gave me to under&s;tand,
that in a po&s;t-chai&s;e, which we had pa&s;&s;ed,
was an Engli&s;h gentleman on his return from
Italy. I wanted to know who he was, and
when he &s;aid he could not tell, I a&s;ked
him, in a very abrupt manner, why he
<PB N="137" REF="139">
had not enquired of his &s;ervant. He &s;hrug|ged
up his &s;houlders, and retired to the
inn door. Having waited about half an hour,
I beckoned to him, and when he approach|ed,
upbraided him with having told me that
I &s;hould be &s;upplied with fre&s;h hor&s;es in a
few minutes: he &s;eemed &s;hocked, and an|&s;wered,
that he thought he had rea&s;on for
what he &s;aid, ob&s;erving, that it was as di&s;|agreeable
to him as to me to wait for a relay.
As it began to rain, I pulled up the gla&s;s in
his face, and he withdrew again to the door,
&s;eemingly ruffled at my deportment. In a
little time the hor&s;es arrived, and three of
them were immediately put to a very hand|&s;ome
po&s;t-chai&s;e, into which he &s;tepped, and
&s;et out, accompanied by a man in a rich li|very
on hor&s;eback. A&s;toni&s;hed at this cir|cum&s;tance,
I a&s;ked the ho&s;tler who he was,
and he replied, that he was a man of fa&s;hi|on
(un &s;eigneur) who lived in the neigh|bourhood
of Auxerre. I was much morti|fied
to find that I had treated a nobleman &s;o
&s;curvily, and &s;colded my own people for not
having more penetration than my&s;elf. I
dare &s;ay he did not fail to de&s;cant upon the
<PB N="138" REF="140">
brutal behaviour of the Engli&s;hman; and
that my mi&s;take &s;erved with him to confirm
the national reproach of bluntne&s;s, and ill
breeding, under which we lie in this coun|try.
The truth is, I was that day more than
u&s;ually peevi&s;h, from the bad weather, as
well as from the dead of a &s;it of the a&s;th|ma,
with which I was threatened: and I
dare &s;ay my appearance &s;eemed as uncouth
to him, as his travelling dre&s;s appeared to
me. I had a grey mourning frock under a
wide great coat, a bob wig without powder,
a very large laced hat, and a meagre, wrin|kled,
di&s;contented countenance.</P>
<P>The fourth night of our journey we lay
at Macon, and the next day pa&s;&s;ed through
the Lyonnois, which is a fine country, full
of towns, villages, and gentlemen's hou&s;es.
In pa&s;&s;ing through the Maconnois, we &s;aw a
great many fields of Indian corn, which
grows to the height of &s;ix or &s;even feet: it
is made into flour for the u&s;e of the com|mon
people, and goes by the name of <HI>Turkey
wheat.</HI> Here likewi&s;e, as well as in Dau|phin&eacute;,
they rai&s;e a va&s;t quantity of very large
<PB N="139" REF="141">
pompions, with the contents of which they
thicken their &s;oup and ragouts.</P>
<P>As we travelled only while the &s;un was
up, on account of my ill health, and the
po&s;t hor&s;es in France are in bad order, we
&s;eldom exceeded twenty leagues a day.</P>
<P>I was directed to a lodging-hou&s;e at Ly|ons,
which being full they &s;hewed us to a
tavern, where I was led up three pair of
&s;tairs, to an apartment con&s;i&s;ting of three
paltry chambers, for which the people de|manded
twelve livres a day: for dinner and
&s;upper they a&s;ked thirty-two, be&s;ides three
livres for my &s;ervant; &s;o that my daily ex|pence
would have amounted to about forty-&s;even
livres, exclu&s;ive of breakfa&s;t and coffee
in the afternoon. I was &s;o provoked at this
extortion, that, without an&s;wering one word,
I drove to another auberge, where I now am,
and pay at the rate of two-and-thirty livres
a day, for which I am very badly lodged, and
but very indifferently entertained. I men|tion
the&s;e circum&s;tances to give you an idea
of the impo&s;ition to which &s;trangers are &s;ub|ject
in this country. It mu&s;t be owned,
however, that in the article of eating, I
<PB N="140" REF="142">
might &s;ave half the money by going to the
public ordinary; but this is a &s;cheme of
economy, which (exclu&s;ive of other di&s;a|greeable
circum&s;tances) neither my own
health, nor that of my wife permits me to
embrace. My journey from Paris to Lyons,
including the hire of the coach, and all ex|pences
on the road, has co&s;t me, within a
few &s;hillings, forty loui'dores. From Paris
our baggage (though not plomb&eacute;) was not
once examined till we arrived in this city, at
the gate of which we were que&s;tioned by one
of the &s;earchers, who, being tipt with half a
crown, allowed us to proceed without fur|ther
enquiry.</P>
<P>I purpo&s;ed to &s;tay in Lyons until I &s;hould
receive &s;ome letters I expected from London,
to be forwarded by my banker at Paris: but
the enormous expence of living in this man|ner
has determined me to &s;et out in a day or
two for Montpellier, although that place is a
good way out of the road to Nice. My rea|&s;ons
for taking that route I &s;hall communi|cate
in my next. Mean-while, I am ever,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER IX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Montpellier, <DATE>November 5, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE city of Lyons has been &s;o often
and &s;o circum&s;tantially de&s;cribed, that
I cannot pretend to &s;ay any thing new on the
&s;ubject. Indeed, I know very little of it, but
what I have read in books; as I had but one
day to make a tour of the &s;treets, &s;quares, and
other remarkable places. The bridge over
the Rhone &s;eems to be &s;o &s;lightly built, that I
&s;hould imagine it would be one day carried
away by that rapid river; e&s;pecially as the
arches are &s;o &s;mall, that after great rains
they are &s;ometimes <HI>bouch&eacute;es,</HI> &s;topped up;
that is, they do not admit a &s;ufficient pa&s;|&s;age
for the encrea&s;ed body of the water. In
order to remedy this dangerous defect, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, they found an arti&s;t &s;ome
years ago, who has removed a middle pier,
and thrown two arches into one. This al|teration
they looked upon as a ma&s;ter-piece
<PB N="142" REF="144">
in architecture, though there is a com|mon
ma&s;on in England, who would have un|dertaken
and performed the work, without
valuing him&s;elf much upon the enterprize.
This bridge, no more than that of St. E&s;prit,
is built, not in a &s;trait line acro&s;s the river,
but with a curve, which forms a convexity to
oppo&s;e the current. Such a bend is certainly
calculated for the better re&s;i&s;ting the general
impetuo&s;ity of the &s;tream, and has no bad
effect to the eye.</P>
<P>Lyons is a great, populous, and flouri&s;hing
city; but I am &s;urpri&s;ed to find it is counted a
healthy place, and that the air of it is e&s;teemed
favourable to pulmonic di&s;orders. It is &s;itu|ated
on the confluence of two large rivers,
from which there mu&s;t be a great epavoration,
as well as from the low mar&s;hy grounds,
which the&s;e rivers often overflow. This mu&s;t
render the air moi&s;t, frouzy, and even putrid,
if it was not well ventilated by winds from
the mountains of Swi&s;&s;erland; and in the lat|ter
end of autumn, it mu&s;t be &s;ubject to
fogs. The morning we &s;et out from thence,
the whole city and adjacent plains were cover|ed
with &s;o thick a fog, that we could not
<PB N="143" REF="145">
di&s;tingui&s;h from the coach the head of
the foremo&s;t mule that drew it. Lyons is
&s;aid to be very hot in &s;ummer, and very cold
in winter; therefore I imagine mu&s;t abound
with inflammatory and intermittent di&s;orders
in the &s;pring and fall of the year.</P>
<P>My rea&s;ons for going to Montpellier, which
is out of the &s;trait road to Nice, were
the&s;e. Having no acquaintance nor corre|&s;pondents
in the South of France, I had de|&s;ired
my credit might be sent to the &s;ame
hou&s;e to which my heavy baggage was con|&s;igned.
I expected to find my baggage at
Cette, which is the &s;ea-port of Montpellier;
and there I al&s;o hoped to find a ve&s;&s;el, in
which I might be tran&s;ported by &s;ea to Nice,
without further trouble. I longed to try
what effect the boa&s;ted air of Montpellier
would have upon my con&s;titution; and I had
a great de&s;ire to &s;ee the famous monuments
of antiquity in and about the ancient city of
Ni&s;mes, which is about eight leagues &s;hort
of Montpellier.</P>
<P>At the inn where we lodged, I found a
return berline, belonging to Avignon, with
three mules, which are the animals com|monly
<PB N="144" REF="146">
u&s;ed for carriages in this country
This I hired for five loui'dores. The coac$
was large, commodious, and well-fitted; the
mules were &s;trong and in good order; and
the driver, who&s;e name was Jo&s;eph, appeared
to be a &s;ober, &s;agacious, intelligent fellow
perfectly well acquainted with every place in
the South of France. He told me he was
owner of the coach: but I afterwards learn|ed,
he was no other than a hired &s;ervant
I likewi&s;e detected him in &s;ome knavery,
in the cour&s;e of our journey; and plainly per|ceived
he had a fellow-feeling with the inn-keepers
on the road; but, in other re&s;pects,
he was very obliging, &s;erviceable, and even
entertaining. There are &s;ome knavi&s;h
practices of this kind, at which a traveller
will do well to &s;hut his eyes, for his own
ea&s;e and convenience. He will be lucky if
he has to do with a &s;en&s;ible knave, like Jo|&s;eph,
who under&s;tood his intere&s;t too wel$
to be guilty of very flagrant pieces of impo|&s;ition.</P>
<P>A man impatient to be at his journey's
end, will find this a mo&s;t di&s;agreeable way
of travelling. In &s;ummer it mu&s;t be quite
<PB N="145" REF="147">
intolerable. The mules are very &s;ure, but
very &s;low. The journey &s;eldom exceeds eight
leagues, about four and twenty miles a day:
and as tho&s;e people have certain fixed &s;tages,
you are &s;ometimes obliged to ri&s;e in a morn|ing
before day; a circum&s;tance very grievous
to per&s;ons in ill health. The&s;e inconveniences,
however, were over-balanced by other <HI>agree|mens.</HI>
We no &s;ooner quitted Lyons, than we got
into &s;ummer weather, and travelling through a
mo&s;t romantic country, along the banks of the
Rhone, had opportunities (from the &s;lowne&s;s of
our pace) to contemplate its beauties at lei&s;ure.</P>
<P>The rapidity of the Rhone is, in a great
mea&s;ure, owing to its being confined within
&s;teep banks on each &s;ide. The&s;e are formed
almo&s;t through its whole cour&s;e, by a double
chain of mountains, which ri&s;e with an abrupt
a&s;cent from both banks of the river. The
mountains are covered with vineyards, inter|&s;per&s;ed
with &s;mall &s;ummer-hou&s;es, and in
many places they are crowned with churches,
chapels, and convents, which add greatly to the
romantic beauty of the pro&s;pect. The high-road,
as far as Avignon, lies along the &s;ide of
the river, which runs almo&s;t in a &s;traight line,
<PB N="146" REF="148">
and affords great convenience for inland
commerce. Travellers, bound to the &s;outhern
parts of France, generally embark in the
<HI>coche d'eau</HI> at Lyons, and glide down this river
with great velocity, pa&s;&s;ing a great number
of towns and villages on each &s;ide, where
they find ordinaries every day at dinner and
&s;upper. In good weather, there is no danger
in this method of travelling, 'till you come
to the Pont St. E&s;prit, where the &s;tream runs
through the arches with &s;uch rapidity, that
the boat is &s;ometimes over&s;et. But tho&s;e
pa&s;&s;engers who are under any apprehen&s;ion
are landed above-bridge, and taken in again,
after the boat has pa&s;&s;ed, ju&s;t in the &s;ame
manner as at London Bridge. The boats that
go up the river are drawn again&s;t the &s;tream
by oxen, which &s;wim through one of the
arches of this bridge, the driver &s;itting be|tween
the horns of the foremo&s;t bea&s;t. We
&s;et out from Lyons early $word$ $onday morn|ing,
and as a robbery had been a few day
before committed in that neighbourhood,
ordered my &s;ervant to load my mu&s;quetoo$
with a charge of eight balls. By the bye
this piece did not fail to attract the curio&s;it
<PB N="147" REF="149">
and admiration of the people in every place
through which we pa&s;&s;ed. The carriage no
&s;ooner halted, than a crowd immediately &s;ur|rounded
the man to view the blunderbu&s;s,
which they dignified with the title of <HI>petit
canon.</HI> At Nuys in Burgundy, he fired it in
the air, and the whole mob di&s;per&s;ed, and
&s;campered off like a flock of &s;heep. In our
journey hither, we generally &s;et out in a
morning at eight o'clock, and travelled 'till
noon, when the mules were put up and re&s;ted
a couple of hours. During this halt, Jo&s;eph
went to dinner, and we went to breakfa&s;t,
after which we ordered provision for our
refre&s;hment in the coach, which we took
about three or four in the afternoon, halting
for that purpo&s;e, by the &s;ide of &s;ome tran&s;pa|rent
brook, which afforded excellent water
to mix with our wine. In this country I was
almo&s;t poi&s;oned with garlic, which they mix
in their ragouts, and all their &s;auces; nay,
the &s;mell of it perfumes the very chambers,
as well as every per&s;on you approach. I was
al&s;o very &s;ick of <HI>beca ficas, grieves,</HI> and other
little birds, which are &s;erved up twice a day
at all ordinaries on the road. They make
<PB N="148" REF="150">
their appearance in vine-leaves, and are al|ways
half raw, in which condition the French
choo&s;e to eat them, rather than run the ri&s;que
of lo&s;ing the juice by over-roa&s;ting.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants on the South of France are
poorly clad, and look as if they were half
&s;tarved, diminutive, &s;warthy, and meagre;
and yet the common people who travel, live
luxuriou&s;ly on the road. Every carrier and
mule-driver has two meals a day, con&s;i&s;ting
each of a couple of cour&s;es and a de&s;ert, with
tolerable &s;mall wine.&mdash;That which is called
<HI>hermitage,</HI> and grows in this province of
Dauphin&eacute;, is &s;old on the &s;pot for three livres
a bottle. The common draught, which you
have at meals in this country, is remarkably
&s;trong, though in flavour much inferior to
that of Burgundy. The accommodation is
tolerable, though they demand (even in
this cheap country) the exorbitant price of
four livres a head for every meal, of tho&s;e
who choo&s;e to eat in their own apart|ments.
I in&s;i&s;ted, however, upon paying
them with three, which they received, though
not without murmuring and &s;eeming di&s;con|tented.
In this journey, we found plenty of
<PB N="149" REF="151">
good mutton, pork, poultry, and game, in|cluding
the red partridge, which is near twice
as big as the partridge of England. Their
hares are likewi&s;e &s;urpri&s;ingly large and juicy.
We &s;aw great flocks of black turkeys feeding
in the fields, but no black cattle; and milk
was &s;o &s;carce, that &s;ometimes we were obliged
to drink our tea without it.</P>
<P>One day perceiving a meadow on the &s;ide
of the road, full of a flower which I took to
be the crocus, I desired my &s;ervant to alight
and pull &s;ome of them. He delivered the
mu&s;quetoon to Jo&s;eph, who began to tamper
with it, and off it went with a prodigious
report, augmented by an eccho from the mountains
that &s;kirted the road. The mules
were &s;o frightened, that they went off at the
gallop; and Jo&s;eph, for &s;ome minutes, could
neither manage the reins, nor open his mouth.
At length he recollected him&s;elf, and the cattle
were &s;topt, by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;ervant,
to whom he delivered the mu&s;quetoon, with
a &s;ignificant &s;hake of the head. Then alight|ing
from the box, he examined the heads of
his three mules, and ki&s;&s;ed each of them in
his turn. Finding they had received no da|mage,
<PB N="150" REF="152">
he came up to the coach, with a pale
vi&s;age and &s;taring eyes, and &s;aid it was God's
mercy he had not killed his bea&s;ts. I an|&s;wered,
that it was a greater mercy he had
not killed his pa&s;&s;engers; for the muzzle of
the piece might have been directed our way
as well as any other, and in that ca&s;e Jo&s;eph
might have been hanged for murder. &startq;I had
as good be hanged (&s;aid he) for murder, as
be ruined by the lo&s;s of my cattle.&endq; This
adventure made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon him,
that he recounted it to every per&s;on we met;
nor would he ever touch the blunderbu&s;s
from that day. I was often diverted with the
conver&s;ation of this fellow, who was very
arch and very communicative. Every af|ternoon,
he u&s;ed to &s;tand upon the foot-board,
at the &s;ide of the coach, and di&s;cour&s;e
with us an hour together. Pa&s;&s;ing by the
gibbet of Valencia, which &s;tands very near
the high-road, we &s;aw one body hanging
quite naked, and another lying broken on
the wheel. I recollected, that Mandrin had
&s;uffered in this place, and calling to Jo&s;eph
to mount the foot-board, a&s;ked if he had ever
&s;een that famous adventurer. At mention of
<PB N="151" REF="153">
the name of Mandrin, the tear &s;tarted in
Jo&s;eph's eye, he di&s;charged a deep &s;igh, or
rather groan, and told me he was his dear
friend. I was a little &s;tartled at this declara|tion;
however, I concealed my thoughts, and
began to a&s;k que&s;tions about the character
and exploits of a man who had made &s;uch
noi&s;e in the world.</P>
<P>He told me, Mandrin was a native of Va|lencia,
of mean extraction: that he had &s;erved
as a &s;oldier in the army, and afterwards acted
as <HI>maltotier,</HI> or tax-gatherer: that at length
he turned <HI>contrebandier,</HI> or &s;muggler, and by
his &s;uperior qualities, rai&s;ed him&s;elf to the
command of a formidable gang, con&s;i&s;ting
of five hundred per&s;ons well armed with car|bines
and pi&s;tols. He had fifty hor&s;e for his
troopers, and three hundred mules for the
carriage of his merchandize. His head-quarters
were in Savoy: but he made incur|&s;ions
into Dauphin&eacute;, and &s;et the <HI>marechau&s;&s;ee</HI>
at defiance. He maintained &s;everal bloody
&s;kirmi&s;hes with the&s;e troopers, as well as
with other regular detachments, and in all
tho&s;e actions &s;ignalized him&s;elf by his cou|rage
and conduct. Coming up at one time
<PB N="152" REF="154">
with fifty of the <HI>marechau&s;&s;ee,</HI> who were in
que&s;t of him, he told them very calmly, he
had occa&s;ion for their hor&s;es and acoutre|ments,
and de&s;ired them to di&s;mount. At
that in&s;tant his gang appeared, and the
troopers complied with his reque&s;t, without
making the lea&s;t oppo&s;ition. Jo&s;eph &s;aid he
was a generous as he was brave, and never
mole&s;ted travellers, nor did the lea&s;t injury
to the poor; but, on the contrary, relieved
them very often. He u&s;ed to oblige the gen|tlemen
in the country to take his merchan|dize,
his tobacco, brandy, and mu&s;lins, at
his own price; and, in the &s;ame manner,
he laid the open towns under contribution.
When he had no merchandize, he borrowed
money of them upon the credit of what he
&s;hould bring when he was better provided.
He was at la&s;t betrayed, by his wench, to the
colonel of a French regiment, who went
with a detachment in the night to the place
where he lay in Savoy, and &s;urprized him in
a wood-hou&s;e, while his people were ab&s;ent
in different parts of the country. For this
intru&s;ion, the court of France made an apo|logy
to the king of Sardinia, in who&s;e ter|ritories
<PB N="153" REF="155">
he was taken. Mandrin being con|veyed
to Valencia, his native place, was for
&s;ome time permitted to go abroad, under a
&s;trong guard, with chains upon his legs;
and here he conver&s;ed freely with all &s;orts of
people, flattering him&s;elf with the hopes of
a pardon, in which, however, he was di&s;ap|pointed.
An order came from court to bring
him to his trial, when he was found guilty,
and condemned to be broke on the wheel.
Jo&s;eph &s;aid he drank a bottle of wine with
him the night before his execution. He bore
his fate with great re&s;olution, ob&s;erving that
if the letter which he had written to the King,
had been delivered, he certainly &s;hould have
obtained his Maje&s;ty's pardon. His execu|tioner
was one of his own gang, who was
pardoned on condition of performing this
office. You know, that criminals broke up|on
the wheel are fir&s;t &s;trangled, unle&s;s the
&s;entence imports, that they &s;hall be broke
alive. As Mandrin had not been guilty of
cruelty in the cour&s;e of his delinquency, he
was indulged with this favour. Speaking
to the executioner, whom he had formerly
commanded, &startq;Jo&s;eph (dit il) je ne veux
<PB N="154" REF="156">
pas que tu me touche, ju&s;q'u&agrave; ce que je &s;ois
roid mort.&endq; Jo&s;eph, &s;aid he, thou &s;halt not
touch me till I am quite dead.&mdash;Our driver
had no &s;ooner pronounced the&s;e words, than
I was &s;truck with a &s;u&s;picion, that he him|&s;elf
was the executioner of his friend Man|drin.
On that &s;u&s;picion, I exclaimed, &startq;ah! ah!
Jo&s;eph!&endq; The fellow blu&s;hed up to the eyes,
and &s;aid, <HI>oui, &s;on nom etoit Jo&s;eph au&s;&s;i bien que
$e mien.</HI> I did not think proper to pro&s;ecute
the inquiry; but did not much reli&s;h the
nature of Jo&s;eph's connexions. The truth
is, he had very much the looks of a ruffian;
though, I mu&s;t own, his behaviour was very
obliging and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive.</P>
<P>On the fifth day of our journey, in the
morning, we pa&s;&s;ed the famous bridge at
St. E&s;prit, which to be &s;ure is a great curio|&s;ity,
from its length, and the number of its
arches: but the&s;e arches are too &s;mall: the
pa&s;&s;age above is too narrow; and the whole
appears to be too &s;light, con&s;idering the force
and impetuo&s;ity of the river. It is not com|parable
to the bridge at We&s;tmin&s;ter, either
for beauty or &s;olidity. Here we entered Lan|guedoc,
and were &s;topped to have our baggage
<PB N="155" REF="157">
examined: but the &s;earcher being tipped
with a three-livre piece, allowed it to pa&s;s.
&mdash;Before we leave Dauphin&eacute;, I mu&s;t ob&s;erve,
that I was not a little &s;urprized to &s;ee figs
and che&s;nuts growing in the open fields, at
the di&s;cretion of every pa&s;&s;enger. It was this
day I &s;aw the famous Pont du Garde; but
as I cannot po&s;&s;ibly include, in this letter, a
de&s;cription of that beautiful bridge, and of
the other antiquities belonging to Ni&s;mes, I
will defer it till the next opportunity, being,
in the mean time, with equal truth and
affection,</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Montpellier, <DATE>November 10, 1763.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BY the Pont St. E&s;prit we entered the
province of Languedoc, and breakfa&s;ted
at Bagnole, which is a little paltry town;
from whence, however, there is an excellent
<PB N="156" REF="158">
road through a mountain, made at a great
expence, and extending about four leagues.
About five in the afternoon, I had the fir&s;t
glimp&s;e of the famous Pont du Garde, which
&s;tands on the right hand, about the di&s;tance
of a league from the po&s;t road to Ni&s;mes,
and about three leagues from that city. I
would not willingly pa&s;s for a fal&s;e enthu&s;ia&s;t
in ta&s;te; but I cannot help ob&s;erving, that
from the fir&s;t di&s;tant view of this noble mo|nument,
till we came near enough to &s;ee it
perfectly, I felt the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of
impatience that I had ever known; and
obliged our driver to put his mules to the
full gallop, in the apprehen&s;ion that it would
be dark before we reached the place. I ex|pected
to find the building, in &s;ome mea&s;ure,
ruinous; but was agreeably di&s;appointed, to
&s;ee it look as fre&s;h as the bridge at We&s;tmin|&s;ter.
The climate is either &s;o pure and dry,
or the free-&s;tone, with which it is built, &s;o
hard, that the very angles of them remain as
acute as if they had been cut la&s;t year. In|deed,
&s;ome large &s;tones have dropped out of
the arches; but the whole is admirably pre|&s;erved,
and pre&s;ents the eye with a piece of
<PB N="157" REF="159">
architecture, &s;o unaffectedly elegant, &s;o &s;imple,
and maje&s;tic, that I will defy the mo&s;t phleg|matic
and &s;tupid &s;pectator to behold it with|out
admiration. It was rai&s;ed in the Au|gu&s;tan
age, by the Roman colony of Ni&s;mes,
to convey a &s;tream of water between two
mountains, for the u&s;e of that city. It &s;tands
over the river Gardon, which is a beautiful
pa&s;toral &s;tream, brawling among rocks, which
form a number of pretty natural ca&s;cades,
and over&s;hadowed on each &s;ide with trees and
&s;hrubs, which greatly add to the rural beau|ties
of the &s;cene. It ri&s;es in the Cevennes,
and the &s;and of it produces gold, as we learn
from Mr. Reaumur, in his e&s;&s;ay on this &s;ub|ject,
in&s;erted in the French Memoirs, for the
year 1718.&mdash;If I lived at Ni&s;mes, or Avig|non
(which la&s;t city is within four &s;hort
leagues of it) I &s;hould take plea&s;ure in form|ing
parties to come hither, in &s;ummer, to
dine under one of the arches of the Pont
du Garde, on a cold collation.</P>
<P>This work con&s;i&s;ts of three bridges, or tire
of arches, one above another; the fir&s;t of
&s;ix, the &s;econd of eleven, and the third of
thirty-&s;ix. The height, comprehending the
<PB N="158" REF="160">
aqueduct on the top, amounts to 174 feet
three inches: the length between the two
mountains, which it unites, extends to 723.
The order of architecture is the Tu&s;can: but
the &s;ymmetry of it, is inconceivable. By
&s;cooping the ba&s;es of the pila&s;ters, of the &s;e|cond
tire of arches, they had made a pa&s;&s;age
for foot-travellers: but though the antients
far excelled us in beauty, they certainly fell
&s;hort of the moderns in point of conveniency.
The citizens of Avignon have, in this parti|cular,
improved the Roman work with a new
bridge by appo&s;ition, con&s;tructed on the &s;ame
plan with that of the lower tire of arches, of
which indeed it &s;eems to be a part, affording
a broad and commodious pa&s;&s;age over the
river, to hor&s;es and carriages of all kinds.
The aqueduct, for the continuance of which
this &s;uperb work was rai&s;ed, conveyed a &s;tream
of &s;weet water from the fountain of Eure,
near the city of Uz&eacute;s, and extended near &s;ix
leagues in length.</P>
<P>In approaching Ni&s;mes, you &s;ee the ruins
of a Roman tower, built on the &s;ummit of
a hill, which over-looks the city. It &s;eems
to have been intended, at fir&s;t, as a watch,
<PB N="159" REF="161">
or &s;ignal-tower, though, in the &s;equel, it was
u&s;ed as a fortre&s;s: what remains of it, is
about ninety feet high; the architecture of
the Doric order. I no &s;ooner alighted at the
inn, than I was pre&s;ented with a pamphlet,
containing an account of Ni&s;mes and its an|tiquities,
which every &s;tranger buys. There
are per&s;ons too who attend in order to &s;hew
the town, and you will always be acco&s;ted by
&s;ome &s;habby antiquarian, who pre&s;ents you
with medals for &s;ale, a&s;&s;uring you they are
genuine antiques, and were dug out of the
ruins of the Roman temple and baths. All
tho&s;e fellows are cheats; and they have of|ten
laid under contribution raw Engli&s;h tra|vellers,
who had more money than di&s;cre|tion.
To &s;uch they &s;ell the vile&s;t and mo&s;t
common tra&s;h: but when they meet with a
connoi&s;&s;eur, they produce &s;ome medals which
are really valuable and curious.</P>
<P>Ni&s;mes, antiently called Nemau&s;is, was
originally a colony of Roman, &s;ettled by
Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, after the battle of Actium.
It is &s;till of con&s;iderable extent, and &s;aid to
contain twelve thou&s;and families; but the
number &s;eems, by this account, to be greatly
<PB N="160" REF="162">
exaggerated. Certain it is, the city mu&s;t
have been formerly very exten&s;ive, as appears
from the circuit of the antient walls, the re|mains
of whieh are &s;till to be &s;een. Its pre|&s;ent
&s;ize is not one third of its former extent.
Its temples, baths, &s;tatues, towers, ba&s;ilica,
and amphitheatre, prove it to have been a
city of great opulence and magnificence. At
pre&s;ent, the remains of the&s;e antiquities are
all that make it re&s;pectable or remarkable;
though here are manufactures of &s;ilk and
wool, carried on with good &s;ucce&s;s. The
water nece&s;&s;ary for the&s;e works is &s;upplied
by a &s;ource at the foot of the rock, upon
which the tower is placed; and here were
di&s;covered the ruins of Romans baths, which
had been formed and adorned with equal
ta&s;te and magnificence. Among the rubbi&s;h
they found a va&s;t profu&s;ion of columns,
va&s;es, capitals, cornices, in&s;criptions, medals,
&s;tatues, and among other things, the finger
of a colo&s;&s;al &s;tatue in bronze, which, ac|cording
to the rules of proportion, mu&s;t
have been fifteen feet high. From the&s;e
particulars, it appears that the edifices mu&s;t
have been &s;pacious and magnificent. Part of
<PB N="161" REF="163">
a te&s;&s;elated pavement &s;till remains. The an|tient
pavement of the bath is &s;till intire; all
the rubbi&s;h has been cleared away; and the
baths, in a great mea&s;ure, re&s;tored on the
old plan, though they are not at pre&s;ent
u&s;ed for any thing but ornament. The wa|ter
is collected into two va&s;t re&s;ervoirs, and
a canal built and lined with hewn &s;tone.
There are three hand&s;ome bridges thrown
over this va&s;t canal. It contains a great body
of excellent water, which by pipes and other
&s;mall branching canals, traver&s;es the town,
and is converted to many different pur|po&s;es
of oeconomy and manufacture. Be|tween
the Roman bath and the&s;e great canals,
the ground is agreeably laid out in plea&s;ure-walks,
for the recreation of the inhabitants.
Here are likewi&s;e ornaments of architecture,
which &s;avour much more of French foppery,
than of the &s;implicity and greatne&s;s of the
antients. It is very &s;urprizing, that this
fountain &s;hould produce &s;uch a great body
of water, as fills the ba&s;in of the &s;ource, the
Roman ba&s;in, two large deep canals three
hundred feet in length, two va&s;t ba&s;ins that
make part of the great canal, which is
<PB N="162" REF="164">
eighteen hundred feet long, eighteen feet
deep, and forty-eight feet broad. When I
&s;aw it, there was in it about eight or nine
feet of water, tran&s;parent as cry&s;tal. It mu&s;t
be ob&s;erved, however, for the honour of
French cleanline&s;s, that in the Roman ba&s;in,
through which this noble &s;tream of water
pa&s;&s;es, I perceived two wa&s;hermen at work
upon children's clouts and dirty linnen. Sur|prized,
and much di&s;gu&s;ted at this filthy
phaenomenon, I a&s;ked by what means, and
by who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion, tho&s;e dirty hags had got
down into the ba&s;in, in order to contaminate
the water at its fountain-head; and under|&s;tood
they belonged to the commandant of
the place, who had the keys of the &s;ubterra|nean
pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>Fronting the Roman baths are the ruins
of an antient temple, which, according to
tradition, was dedicated to Diana: but it has
been ob&s;erved by connoi&s;&s;eurs, that all the
antient temples of this godde&s;s were of the
Ionic order; whereas, this is partly Corin|thian,
and partly compo&s;ite. It is about
&s;eventy foot long, and &s;ix and thirty in
breadth, arched above, and built of large
<PB N="163" REF="165">
blocks of &s;tone, exactly joined together with|out
any cement. The walls are &s;till &s;tand|ing,
with three great tabernacles at the fur|ther
end, fronting the entrance. On each
&s;ide, there are niches in the intercolumnia|tion
of the walls, together with pede&s;tals
and &s;hafts of pillars, cornices, and an enta|blature,
which indicate the former magnifi|cence
of the building. It was de&s;troyed
during the civil war that raged in the reign
of Henry III. of France.</P>
<P>It is amazing, that the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive irruptions
of barbarous nations, of Goths, Vandals,
and Moors; of fanatic croi&s;ards, &s;till more
&s;anguinary and illiberal than tho&s;e Barbarians,
&s;hould have &s;pared this temple, as well as
two other &s;till more noble monuments of
architecture, that to this day adorn the city
of Ni&s;mes: I mean the amphitheatre and
the edifice, called <HI>Mai&s;on Carr&eacute;e.</HI>&mdash;The for|mer
of the&s;e is counted the fine&s;t monu|ment
of the kind, now extant; and was
built in the reign of Antoninus Pius, who
contributed a large &s;um of money towards
its erection. It is of an oval figure, one
thou&s;and and eighty feet in circumference,
<PB N="164" REF="166">
capacious enough to hold twenty thou&s;and
&s;pectators. The architecture is of the Tu&s;can
order, &s;ixty feet high, compo&s;ed of two open
galleries, built one over another, con&s;i&s;ting
each of three&s;core arcades. The entrance
into the arena was by four great gates, with
porticos; and the &s;eats, of which there were
thirty, ri&s;ing one above another, con&s;i&s;ted of
great blocks of &s;tone, many of which &s;till
remain. Over the north gate, appear two
bulls, in <HI>alto relievo,</HI> extremely well executed,
emblems which, according to the cu&s;tom of
the Romans, &s;ignified that the amphitheatre
was erected at the expence of the people.
There are in other parts of it &s;ome work in
<HI>bas releif,</HI> and heads or bu&s;ts but indifferent|ly
carved. It &s;tands in the lower part of the
town, and &s;trikes the &s;pectator with awe and
veneration. The external architecture is al|mo&s;t
intire in its whole circuit; but the arena
is filled up with hou&s;es.&mdash;This amphithea|tre
was fortified as a citadel by the Vi&s;igoths,
in the beginning of the &s;ixth century. They
rai&s;ed within it a ca&s;tle, two towers of which
are &s;till extant; and they &s;urrounded it with
a broad and deep fo&s;&s;&eacute;e, which was filled up
<PB N="165" REF="167">
in the thirteenth century. In all the &s;ub&s;e|quent
wars to which this city was expo&s;ed,
it &s;erved as the la&s;t re&s;ort of the citizens, and
&s;u&s;tained a great number of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive attacks;
&s;o that its pre&s;ervation is almo&s;t miraculous.
It is likely, however, to &s;uffer much more
from the Gothic avarice of its own citizens,
&s;ome of whom are mutilating it every day,
for the &s;ake of the &s;tones, which they employ
in their own private buildings. It is &s;urpriz|ing,
that the King's authority has not been
exerted to put an end to &s;uch &s;acrilegious vio|lation.</P>
<P>If the amphitheatre &s;trikes you with an
idea of greatne&s;s, the <HI>Mai&s;on Carr&eacute;e</HI> enchants
you with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite beauties of archi|tecture
and &s;culpture. This is an edifice,
&s;uppo&s;ed formerly to have been erected by
Adrian, who actually built a ba&s;ilica in this
city, though no ve&s;tiges of it remain: but
the following in&s;cription, which was di&s;co|vered
on the front of it, plainly proves, that
it was built by the inhabitants of Ni&s;mes, in
honour of Caius and Lucius Cae&s;ar, the
grand-children of Augu&s;tus, by his daughter
Julia, the wife of Agrippa.</P>

PRINCIPIBVS IVVENTVTIS.</Q>
<P>This beautiful edifice, which &s;tands upon a
pediment &s;ix feet high, is eighty-two feet
long, thirty-five broad, and thirty-&s;even
high, without reckoning the pediment. The
body of it is adorned with twenty columns
engaged in the wall, and the peri&s;tyle, which
is open, with ten detached pillars that &s;up|port
the entablature. They are all of the
Corinthian order, fluted and embelli&s;hed
with capitals of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite &s;culpture:
the frize and cornice are much admired, and
the foliage is e&s;teemed inimitable. The pro|portions
of the building are &s;o happily united,
as to give it an air of maje&s;ty and grandeur,
which the mo&s;t indifferent &s;pectator cannot
behold without emotion. A man needs not
be a connoi&s;&s;eur in architecture, to enjoy the&s;e
beauties. They are indeed &s;o exqui&s;ite that
you may return to them every day with a
fre&s;h appetite for &s;even years together. What
<PB N="167" REF="169">
renders them the more curious, they are &s;till
entire, and very little affected, either by the
ravages of time, or the havoc of war. Car|dinal
Alberoni declared, that it was a jewel
that de&s;erved a cover of gold to pre&s;erve it
from external injuries. An Italian painter,
perceiving a &s;mall part of the roof repaired
by modern French ma&s;onry, tore his hair,
and exclaimed in a rage, &startq;Zounds! what
do I &s;ee? harlequin's hat on the head of Au|gu&s;tus!&endq;</P>
<P>Without all doubt it is ravi&s;hingly beau|tiful.
The whole world cannot parallel it;
and I am a&s;toni&s;hed to &s;ee it &s;tanding entire,
like the effects of inchantment, after &s;uch a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of ages, every one more barbarous
than another. The hi&s;tory of the antiqui|ties
of Ni&s;mes takes notice of a grote&s;que
&s;tatue, repre&s;enting two female bodies and
legs, united under the head of an old man;
but, as it does not inform us where it is
kept, I did not &s;ee it.</P>
<P>The whole country of Languedoc is
&s;haded with olive trees, the fruit of which
begins to ripen, and appears as black as &s;loes;
tho&s;e they pickle are pulled green, and &s;teeped
<PB N="168" REF="170">
for &s;ome time in a lye made of quick lime or
wood a&s;hes, which extracts the bitter ta&s;te,
and makes the fruit tender. Without this
preparation it is not eatable. Under the
olive and fig trees, they plant corn and vines,
&s;o that there is not an inch of ground unla|boured:
but here are no open fields, mea|dows,
or cattle to be &s;een. The ground is
overloaded; and the produce of it crowded to
&s;uch a degree, as to have a bad effect upon
the eye, impre&s;&s;ing the traveller with the ideas
of indigence and rapacity. The heat in &s;um|mer
is &s;o exce&s;&s;ive, that cattle would find no
green forage, every blade of gra&s;s being parched
up and de&s;troyed. The weather was extremely
hot when we entered Montpellier, and put up
at the <HI>Cheval Blanc,</HI> counted the be&s;t <HI>auberge</HI>
in the place, tho' in fact it is a mo&s;t wretched
hovel, the habitation of darkne&s;s, dirt, and
impo&s;ition. Here I was obliged to pay four
livres a meal for every per&s;on in my family,
and two livres at night for every bed, though
all in the &s;ame room: one would imagine that
the further we advance to the &s;outhward the
living is the dearer, though in fact every ar|ticle
of hou&s;ekeeping is cheaper in Languedoc
<PB N="169" REF="171">
than many other provinces of France. This
impo&s;ition is owing to the concour&s;e of En|gli&s;h
who come hither, and, like &s;imple birds
of pa&s;&s;age, allow them&s;elves to be plucked by
the people of the country, who know their
weak &s;ide, and make their attacks accord|ingly.
They affect to believe, that all the
travellers of our country are grand &s;eigneurs,
immen&s;ely rich and incredibly generous; and
we are &s;illy enough to encourage this opinion,
by &s;ubmitting quietly to the mo&s;t ridiculous
extortion, as well as by committing acts of
the mo&s;t ab&s;urd extravagance. This folly
of the Engli&s;h, together with a concour&s;e of
people from different quarters, who come hi|ther
for the re-e&s;tabli&s;hment of their health,
has rendered Montpellier one of the deare&s;t
places in the South of France. The city, which
is but &s;mall, &s;tands upon a ri&s;ing ground front|ing
the Mediterranean, which is about three
leagues to the &s;outhward: on the other &s;ide
is an agreeable plain, extending about the
&s;ame di&s;tance towards the mountains of the
Cevennes. The town is reckoned well built,
and what the French call <HI>bien perc&eacute;e;</HI> yet the
&s;treets are in general narrow, and the hou&s;es
<PB N="170" REF="172">
dark. The air is counted &s;alutary in catarrhous
con&s;umptions, from its dryne&s;s and ela&s;ticity:
but too &s;harp in ca&s;es of pulmonary impo&s;t|humes.</P>
<P>It was at Montpellier that we &s;aw for the
fir&s;t time any &s;igns of that gaiety and mirth
for which the people of this country are cele|brated.
In all other places through which we
pa&s;&s;ed &s;ince our departure from Lyons, we &s;aw
nothing but marks of poverty and chagrin.
We entered Montpellier on a Sunday, when
the people were all dre&s;&s;ed in their be&s;t appa|rel.
The &s;treets were crowded; and a great
number of the better &s;ort of both &s;exes &s;at up|on
&s;tone &s;eats at their doors, conver&s;ing with
great mirth and familiarity. The&s;e conver|&s;ations
la&s;ted the greate&s;t part of the night;
and many of them were improved with mu|&s;ick
both vocal and in&s;trumental: next day
we were vi&s;ited by the Engli&s;h re&s;iding in the
place, who always pay this mark of re&s;pect
to new comers. They con&s;i&s;t of four or five
families, among whom I could pa&s;s the win|ter
very agreeably, if the &s;tate of my health
and other rea&s;ons did not call me away.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="173">
Mr. L&mdash;had arrived two days before me,
troubled with the &s;ame a&s;thmatic di&s;order,
under which I have laboured &s;o long. He
told me he had been in que&s;t of me ever
&s;ince he left England. Upon comparing notes,
I found he had &s;topped at the door of a
country inn in Picardy, and drank a gla&s;s
of wine and water, while I was at dinner
up &s;tairs; nay, he had even &s;poke to my
&s;ervant, and a&s;ked who was his ma&s;ter,
and the man, not knowing him, replied, he
was a gentleman from Chel&s;ea. He had walk|ed
by the door of the hou&s;e where I lodged at
Paris, twenty times, while I was in that city;
and the very day before he arrived at Mont|pellier,
he had pa&s;&s;ed our coach on the road.</P>
<P>The garri&s;on of this city con&s;i&s;ts of two
battalions, one of which is the Iri&s;h regi|ment
of Berwick, commanded by lieutenant
colonel Tents, a gentleman with whom we
contracted an acquaintance at Boulogne. He
treats us with great politene&s;s, and indeed
does every thing in his power to make the
place agreeable to us. The duke of Fitz-James,
the governor, is expected here in a
little time. We have already a tolerable con|cert
<PB N="172" REF="174">
twice a week; there will be a comedy
in the winter; and the &s;tates of Provence
a&s;&s;emble in January, &s;o that Montpellier will
be extremely gay and brilliant. The&s;e very
circum&s;tances would determine me to leave
it. I have not health to enjoy the&s;e plea|&s;ures:
I cannot bear a croud of company,
&s;uch as pours in upon us unexpectedly at all
hours; and I fore&s;ee, that in &s;taying at Mont|pellier,
I &s;hould be led into an expence, which I
can ill afford. I have therefore forwarded the
letter I received from general P&mdash;n, to Mr.
B&mdash;d, our con&s;ul at Nice, &s;ignifying my
intention of going thither, and explaining
the kind of accommodation I would chu&s;e
to have at that place.</P>
<P>The day after our arrival, I procured to|lerable
lodgings in the High Street, for which
I pay fifty &s;ols, &s;omething more than two
&s;hillings per day; and I am furni&s;hed with
two meals a day by a <HI>traiteur</HI> for ten livres:
but he finds neither the wine nor the de&s;ert;
and indeed we are but indifferently &s;erved.
Tho&s;e families who re&s;ide here find their ac|count
in keeping hou&s;e. Every traveller
who comes to this, or any other, town in
<PB N="173" REF="175">
France with a de&s;ign to &s;tay longer than a
day or two, ought to write beforehand to his
corre&s;pondent to procure furni&s;hed lodgings,
to which he may be driven immediately, with|out
being under the nece&s;&s;ity of lying in an
execrable inn; for all the inns of this coun|try
are execrable.</P>
<P>My baggage is not yet arrived by the ca|nal
of Languedoc; but that gives me no
di&s;turbance, as it is con&s;igned to the care of
Mr. Ray, an Engli&s;h merchant and banker of
this place; a gentleman of great probity and
worth, from whom I have received repeated
marks of uncommon friend&s;hip and ho&s;pi|tality.</P>
<P>The next time you hear of me will be from
Nice: mean-while, I remain always,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Montpellier, <DATE>November 12.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Flattered my&s;elf with the hope of much
amu&s;ement during my &s;hort &s;tay at Mont|pellier.&mdash;
The Univer&s;ity, the Botanical Gar|den,
the State of Phy&s;ic in this part of the
world, and the information I received of a
curious collection of manu&s;cripts, among
which I hoped to find &s;omething for our
friend Dr. H&mdash;r; all the&s;e particulars pro|mi&s;ed
a rich fund of entertainment, which,
however, I cannot enjoy.</P>
<P>A few days after my arrival, it began to
rain with a &s;outherly wind, and continued
without cea&s;ing the be&s;t part of a week, leav|ing
the air &s;o loaded with vapours, that there
was no walking after &s;un-&s;et; without being
wetted by the dew almo&s;t to the &s;kin. I have
always found a cold and damp atmo&s;phere
the mo&s;t unfavourable of any to my con&s;ti|tution.
My a&s;thmatical di&s;order, which had
<PB N="175" REF="177">
not given me much di&s;turbance &s;ince I left
Boulogne, became now very trouble&s;ome, at|tended
with fever, cough, &s;pitting, and low|ne&s;s
of &s;pirits; and I wa&s;ted vi&s;ibly every
day. I was favoured with the advice of Dr.
Fitz-maurice, a very worthy &s;en&s;ible phy&s;ician
&s;ettled in this place: but I had the curio&s;ity
to know the opinion of the celebrated profe&s;|&s;or
F&mdash;, who is the Boerhaave of Mont|pellier.
The account I had of his private
character, and per&s;onal deportment, from &s;ome
Engli&s;h people to whom he was well known,
left me no de&s;ire to conver&s;e with him: but
I re&s;olved to con&s;ult with him on paper. This
great lanthorn of medicine is become very
rich and very in&s;olent; and in proportion as
his wealth increa&s;es, he is &s;aid to grow the
more rapacious. He piques him&s;elf upon be|ing
very &s;lovenly, very blunt, and very unman|nerly;
and perhaps to the&s;e qualifications he
owes his reputation rather than to any &s;upe|rior
&s;kill in medicine. I have known them
&s;ucceed in our own country&punc; and &s;een a doc|tor's
parts e&s;timated by his brutality and pre|&s;umption.</P>
<P><PB N="176" REF="178">
F&mdash;is in his per&s;on and addre&s;s not
unlike our old acquaintance Dr. Sm&mdash;ie; he
&s;toops much, dodges along, and affects to
&s;peak the <HI>Patois,</HI> which is a corruption of
the old <HI>Provencial</HI> tongue, &s;poken by the vul|gar
in Languedoc and Provence. Notwith|&s;tanding
his great age and great wealth, he
will &s;till &s;cramble up two pair of &s;tairs for a
fee of &s;ix livres; and without a fee he will
give his advice to no per&s;on what&s;oever. He
is &s;aid to have great practice in the venereal
branch, and to be frequented by per&s;ons of
both &s;exes infected with this di&s;temper, not
only from every part of France, but al&s;o from
Spain, Italy, Germany, and England. I need
&s;ay nothing of the Montpellier method of cure,
which is well known at London; but I have
&s;ome rea&s;on to think the great profe&s;&s;or F&mdash;,
has, like the famous Mrs. Mapp, the bone|&s;etter,
cured many patients that were never
di&s;ea&s;ed.</P>
<P>Be that as it may, I &s;ent my <HI>valet de place,</HI>

the &s;ervant to a&s;k when he &s;hould re|turn

another fee. He de&s;ired him to come next

gave him to under&s;tand, that whatever mon|&s;ieur
might &s;end, &s;hould be for his (the &s;er|vant's)
advantage. In all probability he did
not expect another gratification, to which,
indeed, he had no title. Mon&s;. F&mdash;was

recour&s;e to recrimination. In the paper which
he &s;ent me next day, he in&s;i&s;ted in general
that he had carefully peru&s;ed the ca&s;e (which
you will perceive was a &s;elf-evident untruth)
he &s;aid the theory it contained was idle; that
he was &s;ure it could not be written by a phy|&s;ician;

<P>I &s;hall make no other comment upon the
medicines, and the regimen which this great
Doctor pre&s;cribed; but that he certainly
mi&s;took the ca&s;e: that upon the &s;uppo&s;ition
I actually laboured under a purulent di&s;charge
from the lungs, his remedies &s;avour &s;trongly
of the old woman; and that there is a total
blank with re&s;pect to the article of exerci&s;e,
which you know is &s;o e&s;&s;ential in all pulmo|nary
di&s;orders. But after having peru&s;ed my
remarks upon his fir&s;t pre&s;cription, he could
not po&s;&s;ibly &s;uppo&s;e that I had turbercules, and
was &s;pitting up pus; therefore his per&s;i&s;ting
in recommending the &s;ame medicines he had
pre&s;cribed on that &s;uppo&s;ition, was a flagrant
<PB N="190" REF="192">
ab&s;urdity.&mdash;If, for example, there was no
<HI>vomica</HI> in the lungs; and the bu&s;ine&s;s was to
attenuate the lymph, what could be more
prepo&s;terous than to advi&s;e the chalk of Brian|&ccedil;on,
coral, antihecticum poterii, and the
balm of Canada? As for the turtle-&s;oupe, it
it is a good re&s;torative and bal&s;amic; but, I
apprehend, will tend to thicken rather than
attenuate the phlegm. He mentions not a
&s;yllable of the air, though it is univer&s;ally
allowed, that the climate of Montpellier is
pernicious to ulcerated lungs; and here I
cannot help recounting a &s;mall adventure
which our doctor had with a &s;on of Mr.
O&mdash;d, merchant in the city of London. I
had it from Mrs. St&mdash;e who was on the &s;pot.
The young gentleman, being con&s;umptive,
con&s;ulted Mr. F&mdash;, who continued vi&s;iting
and pre&s;cribing for him a whole month. At
length, perceiving that he grew daily wor&s;e,
&startq;Doctor (&s;aid he) I take your pre&s;criptions
punctually; but, in&s;tead of being the better
for them, I have now not an hour's remi&s;|&s;ion

&mdash;I cannot conceive the meaning of it.&endq;
F&mdash;, who perceived he had not long to live,
<PB N="191" REF="193">
told him the rea&s;on was very plain: the air of
Montpellier was too &s;harp for his lungs,
which required a &s;ofter climate. &startq;Then
you're a &s;ordid villain (cried the young man)
for allowing me to &s;tay here till my con&s;titu|tion

pay no regard to the &s;tate of the &s;olids
in chronical di&s;orders: that exerci&s;e and the

&s;eem to think the &s;curvy is entirely an Eng|li&s;h

often confound the &s;ymptoms of it, with

<HEAD>LETTER XII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>December 6, 176$.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE inhabitants of Montpellier are &s;o|ciable,
gay, and good tempered. They
have a &s;pirit of commerce, and have erected
&s;everal con&s;iderable manufactures in the neigh|bourhood
of the city. People a&s;&s;emble every
day to take the air on the e&s;planade, where
there is a very good walk, ju&s;t without the
gate of the citadel: but, on the other &s;ide of
the town, there is another &s;till more agreea|ble,
called the <HI>peirou,</HI> from whence there is
a pro&s;pect of the Mediterranean on one &s;ide,
and of the Cevennes on the other. Here is a
good eque&s;trian &s;tatue of Louis XIV. front|ing
one gate of the city, which is built in
form of a triumphal arch, in honour of the
&s;ame monarch. Immediately under the <HI>pierou</HI>
is the phy&s;ic garden, and near it an arcade ju&s;t
fini&s;hed for an aqueduct, to convey a &s;tream
of water to the upper parts of the city. Per|haps
<PB N="193" REF="195">
I &s;hould have thought this a neat piece
of work, if I had not &s;een the <HI>Pont du Garde:</HI>
but, after having viewed the Roman arches, I
could not look upon this but with pity and
contempt. It is a wonder how the architect
could be &s;o fanta&s;tically modern, having &s;uch
a noble model, as it were, before his eyes.</P>
<P>There are many prote&s;tants at this place,
as well as at Ni&s;mes, and they are no longer
mole&s;ted on the &s;core of religion. They
have their conventicles in the country, where
they a&s;&s;emble privately for wor&s;hip. The&s;e
are well known; and detachments are &s;ent
out every Sunday to intercept them; but
the officer has always private directions to
take another route. Whether this indulgence
comes from the wi&s;dom and lenity of the
government, or is purcha&s;ed with money
of the commanding officer, I cannot deter|mine:
but certain it is, the laws of France
puni&s;h capitally every prote&s;tant mini&s;ter
convicted of having performed the functions
of his mini&s;try in this kingdom; and one
was hanged about two years ago, in the
neighbourhood of Montauban.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="196">
The markets in Montpellier are well
&s;upplied with fi&s;h, poultry, butcher's
meat, and game, at rea&s;onable rates. The
wine of the country is &s;trong and har&s;h,
and never drank, but when mixed with wa|ter.
Burgundy is dear, and &s;o is the &s;weet
wine of Frontignan, though made in the
neighbourhood of Cette. You know it is
famous all over Europe, and &s;o are the
<HI>liqueurs,</HI> or drams of various &s;orts, com|pounded
and di&s;tilled at Montpellier. Cette
is the &s;ea-port, about four leagues from that
city: but the canal of Languedoc comes up
within a mile of it; and is indeed a great
curio&s;ity: a work in all re&s;pects worthy of
a Colbert, under who&s;e au&s;pices it was
fini&s;hed. When I find &s;uch a general tri|bute
of re&s;pect and veneration paid to the
memory of that great man, I am a&s;toni&s;hed
to &s;ee &s;o few monuments of public utility
left by other mini&s;ters. One would imagine,
that even the de&s;ire of prai&s;e would prompt
a much greater number to exert them&s;elves
for the glory and advantage of their coun|try;
yet, in my opinion, the French have
<PB N="195" REF="197">
been ungrateful to Colbert, in the &s;ame pro|portion
as they have over-rated the character
of his ma&s;ter. Through all France one
meets with &s;tatues and triumphal arches
erected to Louis XIV. in con&s;equence of his
victories; by which, likewi&s;e, he acquired
the title of Louis le Grand. But how were
tho&s;e victories obtained? Not by any per&s;onal
merit of Louis. It was Colbert who im|proved
his finances, and enabled him to pay
his army. It was Louvois that provided all
the nece&s;&s;aries of war. It was a Cond&ecirc;, a
Turenne, a Luxemburg, a Vendome, who
fought his battles; and his fir&s;t conque&s;ts,
for which he was deified by the pen of adu|lation,
were obtained almo&s;t without blood|&s;hed,
over weak, di&s;pirited, divided, and
defencele&s;s nations. It was Colbert that im|proved
the marine, in&s;tituted manufactures,
encouraged commerce, undertook works of
public utility, and patronized the arts and
&s;ciences. But Louis (you will &s;ay) had the
merit of choo&s;ing and &s;upporting tho&s;e mi|ni&s;ters,
and tho&s;e generals. I an&s;wer, no.
He found Colbert and Louvois already
<PB N="196" REF="198">
cho&s;en: he found Cond&ecirc; and Turenne in
the very zenith of military reputation. Lux|emburg
was Conde's pupil; and Vendome,
a prince of the blood, who at fir&s;t obtained
the command of armies in con&s;equence of
his high birth, and happened to turn out a
man of genius. The &s;ame Louis had the
&s;agacity to revoke the edict of Nantz; to
entru&s;t his armies to a Tallard, a Villeroy,
and a Mar&s;in. He had the humanity to
ravage the country, burn the towns, and
ma&s;&s;acre the people of the Palatinate. He
had the patrioti&s;m to impoveri&s;h and depo|pulate
his own kingdom, in order to pro&s;e|cute
&s;chemes of the mo&s;t lawle&s;s ambition.
He had the con&s;olation to beg a peace from
tho&s;e he had provoked to war by the mo&s;t
outrageous in&s;olence; and he had the glory
to e&s;pou&s;e Mrs. Maintenon in her old age,
the widow of the buffoon Scarron. Without
all doubt, it was from irony he acquired the
title <HI>le Grand.</HI></P>
<P>Having received a favourable an&s;wer from
Mr. B&mdash;, the Engli&s;h con&s;ul at Nice, and
recommended the care of my heavy baggage
<PB N="197" REF="199">
to Mr. Ray, who undertook to &s;end it by &s;ea
from Cette to Villefranche, I hired a coach
and mules for &s;even loui'dores, and &s;et out
from Montpellier on the 13th of November,
the weather being agreeable, though the air
was cold and fro&s;ty. In other re&s;pects there
were no &s;igns of winter: the olives were now
ripe, and appeared on each &s;ide of the road
as black as &s;loes; and the corn was already
half a foot high. On the &s;econd day of our
journey, we pa&s;&s;ed the Rhone on a bridge of
boats at Buccaire, and lay on the other &s;ide
at Tarra&s;cone. Next day we put up at a
wretched place called Orgon, where, how|ever,
we were regaled with an excellent &s;up|per;
and among other delicacies, with a di&s;h
of green pea&s;e. Provence is a plea&s;ant coun|try,
well cultivated; but the inns are not &s;o
good here as in Languedoc, and few of them
are provided with a certain convenience which
an Engli&s;h traveller can very ill di&s;pen&s;e with.
Tho&s;e you find are generally on the tops of
hou&s;es, exceedingly na&s;ty; and &s;o much
expo&s;ed to the weather, that a valetudina|rian
cannot u&s;e them without hazard of his
<PB N="198" REF="200">
life. At Ni&s;mes in Languedoc, where we
found the temple of Cloacina in a mo&s;t
&s;hocking condition, the &s;ervant-maid told
me her mi&s;tre&s;s had cau&s;ed it to be made on
purpo&s;e for the Engli&s;h travellers; but now
&s;he was very &s;orry for what &s;he had done,
as all the French who frequented her hou&s;e,
in&s;tead of u&s;ing the &s;eat, left their offerings
on the floor, which &s;he was obliged to have
cleaned three or four times a day. This is
a degree of bea&s;tline&s;s, which would appear
dete&s;table even in the capital of North-Bri|tain.
On the fourth day of our pilgrimage,
we lay in the &s;uburbs of Aix, but did not
enter the city, which I had a great curio&s;ity
to &s;ee. The villainous a&s;thma baulked me of
that &s;atisfaction. I was pinched with the
cold, and impatient to reach a warmer cli|mate.
Our next &s;tage was at a paltry vil|lage,
where we were poorly entertained. I
looked &s;o ill in the morning, that the good
woman of the hou&s;e, who was big with
child, took me by the hand at parting, and
even &s;hed tears, praying fervently that God
would re&s;tore me to my health. This was
<PB N="199" REF="201">
the only in&s;tance of &s;ympathy, compa&s;&s;ion,
or goodne&s;s of heart, that I had met with
among the publicans of France. Indeed, at
Valencia, our landlady under&s;tanding I was
travelling to Montpellier for my health,
would have di&s;&s;uaded me from going thither;
and exhorted me, in particular, to beware
of the phy&s;icians, who were all a pack of
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. She advi&s;ed me to eat frica&s;&s;ees of
chickens, and white meat, and to take a
good <HI>bouillon</HI> every morning.</P>
<P>A <HI>bouillon</HI> is an univer&s;al remedy among
the good people of France; in&s;omuch, that
they have no idea of any per&s;on's dying,
after having &s;wallowed <HI>un bon bouillon.</HI> One
of the Engli&s;h gentlemen, who were robbed
and murdered about thirty years ago between
Calais and Boulogne, being brought to the
po&s;t-hou&s;e of Boulogne with &s;ome &s;igns of
life, this remedy was immediately admini&s;|tred.
&startq;What &s;urpri&s;es me greatly, (&s;aid the
po&s;t-ma&s;ter, &s;peaking of this melancholy
&s;tory to a friend of mine, two years after
it happened) I made an excellent <HI>bouillon,</HI>
and poured it down his throat with my own
<PB N="200" REF="202">
hands, and yet he did not recover.&endq; Now,
in all probability, this <HI>bouillon</HI> it was that
&s;topped his breath. When I was a very
young man, I remember to have &s;een a per|&s;on
&s;uffocated by &s;uch impertinent officiou&s;|ne&s;s.
A young man of uncommon parts
and erudition, very well e&s;teemed at the
univer&s;ity of G&mdash;ow, was found early
one morning in a &s;ubterranean vault among
the ruins of an old archiepi&s;copal palace,
with his throat cut from ear to ear. Being
conveyed to a public-hou&s;e in the neighbour|hood,
he made &s;igns for pen, ink, and pa|per,
and in all probability would have ex|plained
the cau&s;e of this terrible cata&s;trophe,
when an old woman, &s;eeing the windpipe
which was cut, &s;ticking out of the wound,
and mi&s;taking it for the gullet, by way of
giving him a cordial to &s;upport his &s;pirits,
poured into it, through a &s;mall funnel, a
gla&s;s of burnt brandy, which &s;trangled him
in the tenth part of a minute. The ga&s;h
was &s;o hideous, and formed by &s;o many re|peated
&s;trokes of a razor, that the &s;urgeons
believed he could not po&s;&s;ibly be the perpe|trator
<PB N="201" REF="203">
him&s;elf; neverthele&s;s, this was certainly
the ca&s;e.</P>
<P>At Brignolles, where we dined, I was
obliged to quarrel with the landlady, and
threaten to leave her hou&s;e, before &s;he would
indulge us with any &s;ort of fle&s;h-meat. It
was meagre day, and &s;he had made her pro|vi&s;ion
accordingly. She even hinted &s;ome
di&s;&s;atisfaction at having heretics in her hou&s;e:
but, as I was not di&s;po&s;ed to eat &s;tinking
fi&s;h, with ragouts of eggs and onions, I in|&s;i&s;ted
upon a leg of mutton, and a brace of
fine partridges, which I found in the larder.
Next day, when we &s;et out in the morning
from Luc, it blew a north-we&s;terly wind &s;o
extremely cold and biting, that even a flan|nel
wrapper could not keep me tolerably
warm in the coach. Whether the cold had
put our coachman in a bad humour, or he
had &s;ome other cau&s;e of re&s;entment again&s;t
him&s;elf, I know not; but we had not gone
above a quarter of a mile, when he drove
the carriage full again&s;t the corner of a gar|den
wall, and broke the axle-tree, &s;o that
we were obliged to return to the inn on foot,
<PB N="202" REF="204">
and wait a whole day, until a new piece
could be made and adju&s;ted. The wind
that blew, is called <HI>Mae&s;tral,</HI> in the Provin|cial
dialect, and indeed is the &s;evere&s;t that
ever I felt. At this inn, we met with a
young French officer who had been a pri&s;oner
in England, and &s;poke our language pretty
well. He told me, that &s;uch a wind did not
blow above twice or three times in a winter,
and was never of long continuance: that in
general, the weather was very mild and
agreeable during the winter months; that
living was very cheap in this part of Pro|vence,
which afforded great plenty of game.
Here, too, I found a young Iri&s;h recollet, in
his way from Rome to his own country. He
complained, that he was almo&s;t &s;tarved by
the inho&s;pitable di&s;po&s;ition of the French
people; and that the regular clergy, in par|ticular,
had treated him with the mo&s;t crue
di&s;dain. I relieved his nece&s;&s;ities, and gave
him a letter to a gentleman of his own coun|try
at Montpellier.</P>
<P>When I ro&s;e in the morning, and opened
a window that looked into the garden,
thought my&s;elf either in a dream, or be
<PB N="203" REF="205">
witched. All the trees were cloathed with
&s;now, and all the country covered at lea&s;t a
foot thick. &startq;This cannot be the &s;outh of
France, (&s;aid I to my&s;elf) it mu&s;t be the
Highlands of Scotland!&endq; At a wretched
town called Muy, where we dined, I had a
warm di&s;pute with our landlord, which,
however, did not terminate to my &s;atisfac|tion.
I &s;ent on the mules before, to the next
&s;tage, re&s;olving to take po&s;t-hor&s;es, and be|&s;poke
them accordingly of the aubergi&s;te,
who was, at the &s;ame time, inn-keeper and
po&s;t-ma&s;ter. We were u&s;hered into the
common eating-room, and had a very indif|ferent
dinner; after which, I &s;ent a loui'dore
to be changed, in order to pay the reckoning.
The landlord, in&s;tead of giving the full
change, deducted three livres a head for din|ner,
and &s;ent in the re&s;t of the money by
my &s;ervant. Provoked more at his ill man|ners,
than at his extortion, I ferretted him
out of a bed-chamber, where he had con|cealed
him&s;elf, and obliged him to re&s;tore
the full change, from which I paid him at
the rate of two livres a head. He refu&s;ed
to take the money, which I threw down on
<PB N="204" REF="206">
the table; and the hor&s;es being ready,
&s;tepped into the coach, ordering the po&s;tili|ons
to drive on. Here I had certainly reck|oned
without my ho&s;t. The fellows declared
they would not budge, until I &s;hould pay
their ma&s;ter; and as I threatened them with
manual cha&s;ti&s;ement, they alighted, and
di&s;appeared in a twinkling. I was now &s;o
incen&s;ed, that though I could hardly breathe;
though the afternoon was far advanced, and
the &s;treet covered with wet &s;now, I walked
to the con&s;ul of the town, and made my
complaint in form. This magi&s;trate, who
&s;eemed to be a taylor, accompanied me to
the inn, where by this time the whole town
was a&s;&s;embled, and endeavoured to per&s;uade
me to compromi&s;e the affair. I &s;aid, as he
was the magi&s;trate, I would &s;tand to his
award. He an&s;wered, &startq;that he would not
pre&s;ume to determine what I was to pay.&endq;
I have already paid him a rea&s;onable price for
his dinner, (&s;aid I) and now I demand po&s;t-hor&s;es
according to the king's ordonnance.
The aubergi&s;te &s;aid the hor&s;es were ready,
but the guides were run away; and he could
not find others to go in their place. I argued
<PB N="205" REF="207">
with great vehemence, offering to leave a
loui'dore for the poor of the pari&s;h, pro|vided
the con&s;ul would oblige the ra&s;|cal
to do his duty. The con&s;ul &s;hrugged
up his &s;houlders, and declared it was not in
his power. This was a lie, but I perceived
he had no mind to di&s;oblige the publican.
If the mules had not been &s;ent away, I
&s;hould certainly have not only payed what I
thought proper, but corrected the landlord
into the bargain, for his in&s;olence and ex|tortion;
but now I was entirely at his
mercy, and as the con&s;ul continued to ex|hort
me in very humble terms, to comply
with his demands, I thought proper to ac|quie&s;ce.
Then the po&s;tilions immediately
appeared: the crowd &s;eemed to exult in the
triumph of the aubergi&s;te; and I was
obliged to travel in the night, in very &s;evere
weather, after all the fatigue and mortifica|tion
I had undergone.</P>
<P>We lay at Frejus, which was the <HI>Forum
Julianum</HI> of the antients, and &s;till boa&s;ts of
&s;ome remains of antiquity; particularly the
ruins of an amphitheatre, and an aqueduct.
The fir&s;t we pa&s;&s;ed in the dark, and next
<PB N="206" REF="208">
morning the weather was &s;o cold that I could
not walk abroad to &s;ee it. The town is at
pre&s;ent very incon&s;iderable, and indeed in a
ruinous condition. Neverthele&s;s, we were
very well lodged at the po&s;t-hou&s;e, and treated
with more politene&s;s than we had met with
in any other part of France.</P>
<P>As we had a very high mountain to
a&s;cend in the morning, I ordered the mules
on before to the next po&s;t, and hired &s;ix
hor&s;es for the coach. At the ea&s;t end of
Frejus, we &s;aw clo&s;e to the road on our left-hand,
the arcades of the antient aqueduct,
and the ruins of &s;ome Roman edifices, which
&s;eemed to have been temples. There was
nothing &s;triking in the architecture of the
aqueduct. The arches are &s;mall and low,
without either grace or ornament, and &s;eem
to have been calculated for mere utility.</P>
<P>The mountain of E&s;terelles, which is
eight miles over, was formerly frequent|ed
by a gang of de&s;perate banditti, who are
now happily exterminated: the road is very
good, but in &s;ome places very &s;teep and
bordered by precipices. The mountain is
covered with pines, and the <HI>laurus cerasus,</HI>
<PB N="207" REF="209">
the fruit of which being now ripe, made a
mo&s;t romantic appearance through the &s;now
that lay upon the branches. The cherries
were &s;o large that I at fir&s;t mi&s;took them for
dwarf oranges. I think they are counted
poi&s;onous in England, but here the people
eat them without he&s;itation. In the middle
of the mountain is the po&s;t-hou&s;e, where
we dined in a room &s;o cold, that the bare
remembrance of it makes my teeth chatter.
After dinner I chanced to look into another
chamber that fronted the &s;outh, where the
&s;un &s;hone; and opening a window perceiv|ed,
within a yard of my hand, a large tree
loaded with oranges, many of which were
ripe. You may judge what my a&s;toni&s;h|ment
was to find Winter in all his rigour
reigning on one &s;ide of the hou&s;e, and Sum|mer
in all her glory on the other. Certain
it is, the middle of this mountain &s;eemed to
be the boundary of the cold weather. As
we proceeded &s;lowly in the afternoon we
were quite enchanted. This &s;ide of the hill
is a natural plantation of the mo&s;t agreeable
ever-greens, pines, firs, laurel, cypre&s;s,
&s;weet myrtle, tamari&s;c, box, and juniper,
<PB N="208" REF="210">
inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;weet marjoram, lavender,
thyme, wild thyme, and &s;age. On the right-hand
the ground &s;hoots up into agreeable
cones, between which you have delightful
vi&s;tas of the Mediterranean, which wa&s;hes
the foot of the rock; and between two di|vi&s;ions
of the mountains, there is a bottom
watered by a charming &s;tream, which greatly
adds to the rural beauties of the &s;cene.</P>
<P>This night we pa&s;&s;ed at Cannes, a little
fi&s;hing town, agreeably &s;ituated on the beach
of the &s;ea, and in the &s;ame place lodged
Mon&s;ieur Nadeau d'Etrueil, the unfortunate
French governor of Guadeloupe, condemn|ed
to be impri&s;oned for life in one of the
i&s;les Muaguerite, which lie within a mile of
this coa&s;t.</P>
<P>Next day we journeyed by the way of
Antibes, a &s;mall maritime town, tolerably
well fortified; and pa&s;&s;ing the little river
Loup, over a &s;tone-bridge, arrived about
noon at the village of St. Laurent, the extre|mity
of France, where we pa&s;&s;ed the Var,
after our baggage had undergone examina|tion.
From Cannes to this village the road
lies along the &s;ea-&s;ide; and &s;ure nothing can
<PB N="209" REF="211">
be more delightful. Though in the morning
there was a fro&s;t upon the ground, the &s;un
was as warm as it is in May in England. The
&s;ea was quite &s;mooth, and the beach formed
of white poli&s;hed pebbles; on the left-hand
the country was covered with green olives, and
the &s;ide of the road planted with large trees
of &s;weet myrtle growing wild like the haw|thorns
in England. From Antibes we had
the fir&s;t view of Nice, lying on the oppo&s;ite
&s;ide of the bay, and making a very agree|able
appearance. The author of the Grand
Tour &s;ays, that from Antibes to Nice the
roads are very bad, through rugged moun|tains
bordered with precipices on the left, and
by the &s;ea to the right; whereas, in fact,
there is neither precipice nor mountain near
it.</P>
<P>The Var, which divides the county of
Nice from Provence, is no other than a tor|rent
fed chiefly by the &s;now that melts on
the maritime Alps, from which it takes its
origin. In the &s;ummer it is &s;welled to a
dangerous height, and this is al&s;o the ca&s;e
after heavy rains: but at pre&s;ent the middle
of it is quite dry, and the water divided into
<PB N="210" REF="212">
two or three narrow &s;treams, which, however,
are both deep and rapid. This river has
been ab&s;urdly enough by &s;ome &s;uppo&s;ed the
Rubicon, in all probability from the de&s;crip|tion
of that river in the Phar&s;alia of Lucan,
who makes it the boundary betwixt Gaul and
Italy&mdash;
<Q><L>&mdash;et Gallica certus</L>
<L>Limes ab Aufoniis di&s;terminat arva colonis;</L></Q>
whereas, in fact, the Rubicon, now called
Pi&s;atello, runs between Ravenna and Ri|mini.&mdash;
But to return to the Var. At the
village of St. Laurent, famous for its Mu&s;|cadine
wines, there is a &s;et of guides always
in attendance to conduct you in your pa&s;&s;age
over the river. Six of tho&s;e fellows, tucked
up above the middle, with long poles in
their hands, took charge of our coach, and
by many windings guided it &s;afe to the op|po&s;ite
&s;hore. Indeed there was no occa&s;ion for
any; but it is a &s;ort of a perqui&s;ite, and I did not
choo&s;e to run any ri&s;que, how &s;mall &s;oever
it might be, for the &s;ake of &s;aving half a
crown, with which they were &s;atisfied. If
you do not gratify the &s;earchers at St. Lau|rent
<PB N="211" REF="213">
with the &s;ame &s;um, they will rummage
your trunks, and turn all your cloaths
top&s;y turvy. And here, once for all, I would
advi&s;e every traveller who con&s;ults his own
ea&s;e and convenience, to be liberal of his mo|ney
to all that &s;ort of people; and even to
wink at the impo&s;ition of aubergi&s;tes on the
road, unle&s;s it be very flagrant. So &s;ure as
you enter into di&s;putes with them, you will
be put to a great deal of trouble, and fret
your&s;elf to no manner of purpo&s;e. I have
travelled with oeconomi&s;ts in England, who
declared they would rather give away a crown
than allow them&s;elves to be cheated of a
farthing. This is a good maxim, but requires
a great &s;hare of re&s;olution and &s;elf-denial to
put in practice in one excur&s;ion. My fellow-traveller
was in a pa&s;&s;ion, and of con&s;equence
very bad company from one end of the
journey to the other. He was ince&s;&s;antly
&s;colding either at landlords, landladies,
waiters, ho&s;tlers, or po&s;tilions. We had
bad hor&s;es, and bad chai&s;es; &s;et out from
every &s;tage with the cur&s;es of the people;
and at this expence I &s;aved about ten &s;hil|lings
in a journey of a hundred and fifty
<PB N="212" REF="214">
miles. For &s;uch a paltry con&s;ideration, he
was contented to be mi&s;erable him&s;elf, and
to make every other per&s;on unhappy with
whom he had any concern. When I came
la&s;t from Bath it rained &s;o hard, that the
po&s;tilion who drove the chai&s;e was wet to
the &s;kin before we had gone a couple of
miles. When we arrived at the Devizes, I
gave him two &s;hillings in&s;tead of one, out
of pure compa&s;&s;ion. The con&s;equence of
this liberality was, that in the next &s;tage we
&s;eemed rather to fly than to travel upon &s;olid
ground. I continued my bounty to the &s;e|cond
driver, and indeed through the whole
journey, and found my&s;elf accommodated
in a very different manner from what I had
experienced before. I had elegant chai&s;es,
with excellent hor&s;es; and the po&s;tilions of
their own accord u&s;ed &s;uch diligence, that
although the roads were broken by the rain,
I travelled at the rate of twelve miles an
hour; and my extraordinary expence from
Bath to London, amounted preci&s;ely to &s;ix
&s;hillings.</P>
<P>The river Var falls into the Mediterranean
a little below St. Laurent, about four miles
<PB N="213" REF="215">
to the we&s;tward of Nice. Within the me|mory
of per&s;ons now living, there have been
three wooden bridges thrown over it, and as
often de&s;troyed in con&s;equence of the jea|lou&s;y
&s;ub&s;i&s;ting between the kings of France
and Sardinia; this river being the boundary
of their dominions on the &s;ide of Provence.
However, this is a con&s;ideration that ought
not to interfere with the other advantages
that would accrue to both kingdoms from
&s;uch a convenience. If there was a bridge
over the Var, and a po&s;t-road made from
Nice to Genoa, I am very confident that all
tho&s;e &s;trangers who now pa&s;s the Alps in
their way to and from Italy, would choo&s;e
this road as infinitely more &s;afe, commodious,
and agreeable. This would al&s;o be the ca&s;e
with all tho&s;e who hire felucas from Mar|&s;eilles
or Antibes, and expo&s;e them&s;elves to
the dangers and inconveniences of travelling
by &s;ea in an open boat.</P>
<P>In the afternoon we arrived at Nice, where
we found Mr. M&mdash;e, the Engli&s;h gen|tleman
whom I had &s;een at Boulogne, and
advi&s;ed to come hither. He had followed
my advice, and reached Nice about a month
<PB N="214" REF="216">
before my arrival, with his lady, child, and
an old gouvernante. He had travelled with
his own po&s;t-chai&s;e and hor&s;es, and is now
lodged ju&s;t without one of the gates of the
city, in the hou&s;e of the count de V&mdash;n,
for which he pays five loui'dores a month.
I could hire one much better in the neighbour|hood
of London, for the &s;ame money. Un|le&s;s
you will &s;ubmit to this extortion, and
hire a whole hou&s;e for a length of time, you
will find no ready-furni&s;hed lodgings at Nice.
After having &s;tewed a week in a paltry inn,
I have taken a ground floor for ten months
at the rate of four hundred livres a year,
that is preci&s;ely twenty pounds &s;terling, for
the Piedmonte&s;e livre is exactly an Engli&s;h
&s;hilling. The apartments are large, lofty,
and commodious enough, with two &s;mall
gardens, in which there is plenty of &s;allad,
and a great number of oranges and lemons:
but as it required &s;ome time to provide fur|niture,
our con&s;ul Mr. B&mdash;d, one of the
be&s;t natured and mo&s;t friendly men in the
world, has lent me his lodgings, which are
charmingly &s;ituated by the &s;ea-&s;ide, and open
upon a terrace, that runs parallel to the
<PB N="215" REF="217">
beach, forming part of the town wall.
Mr. B&mdash;d him&s;elf lives at Villa Franca,
which is divided from Nice by a &s;ingle moun|tain,
on the top of which there is &s;mall
fort, called the ca&s;tle of Montalban. Im|mediately
after our arrival we were vi&s;ited
by one Mr. de Martines, a mo&s;t agreeable
young fellow, a lieutenant in the Swi&s;s regi|ment,
which is here in garri&s;on. He is a
Prote&s;tant, extremely fond of our nation,
and under&s;tands our language tolerably well.
He was particularly recommended to our
acquaintance by general P&mdash;and his lady;
we are happy in his conver&s;ation; find him
wonderfully obliging, and extremely &s;ervice|able
on many occa&s;ions. We have likewi&s;e
made acquaintance with &s;ome other indivi|duals,
particularly with Mr. St. Pierre, junior,
who is a con&s;iderable merchant, and con&s;ul
for Naples. He is a well-bred, &s;en&s;ible
young man, &s;peaks Engli&s;h, is an excellent
performer on the lute and mandolin, and has
a pretty collection of books. In a word, I
hope we &s;hall pa&s;s the winter agreeably
enough, e&s;pecially if Mr. M&mdash;e &s;hould
hold out; but I am afraid he is too far gone
<PB N="216" REF="218">
in a con&s;umption to recover. He &s;pent the
la&s;t winter at Ni&s;mes, and con&s;ulted F&mdash;at
Montpellier. I was impatient to &s;ee the
pre&s;cription, and found it almo&s;t verbatim
the &s;ame he had &s;ent to me; although I am
per&s;uaded there is a very e&s;&s;ential difference
between our di&s;orders. Mr. M&mdash;e has
been long afflicted with violent &s;pa&s;ms,
colliquative &s;weats, pro&s;tration of appetite,
and a di&s;order in his bowels. He is likewi&s;e
jaundiced all over, and I am confident his
liver is un&s;ound. He tried the tortoi&s;e &s;oup,
which he &s;aid in a fortnight &s;tuffed him up
with phlegm. This gentleman has got a
&s;mattering of phy&s;ic, and I am afraid tempers
with his own con&s;titution, by means of
Brookes's Practice of Phy&s;ic, and &s;ome di&s;|pen&s;atories,
which he is continually poring
over. I beg pardon for this tedious epi&s;tle,
and am,</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>January 15, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Am at la&s;t &s;ettled at Nice, and have lei&s;ure
to give you &s;ome account of this very
remarkable place. The county of Nice ex|tends
about four&s;core miles in length, and
in &s;ome places it is thirty miles broad. It
contains &s;everal &s;mall towns, and a great
number of villages; all of which, this ca|pital
excepted, are &s;ituated among moun|tains,
the mo&s;t exten&s;ive plain of the whole
country being this where I now am, in the
neighbourhood of Nice. The length of it
does not exceed two miles, nor is the breadth
of it, in any part, above one. It is bound|ed
by the Mediterranean on the &s;outh. From
the &s;ea-&s;hore, the maritime Alps begin with
hills of a gentle a&s;cent, ri&s;ing into moun|tains
that form a &s;weep or amphitheatre
ending at Montalban, which over-hangs the
town of Villa Franca. On the we&s;t &s;ide
of this mountain, and in the ea&s;tern extre|mity
of the amphitheatre, &s;tands the city of
<PB N="218" REF="220">
Nice, wedged in between a &s;teep rock and
the little river Paglion, which de&s;cends from
the mountains, and wa&s;hing the town-walls
on the we&s;t &s;ide, falls into the &s;ea, after
having filled &s;ome canals for the u&s;e of the
inhabitants. There is a &s;tone-bridge of three
arches over it, by which tho&s;e who come
from Provence enter the city. The channel
of it is very broad, but generally dry in
many places; the water (as in the Var) di|viding
it&s;elf into &s;everal &s;mall &s;treams. The
Paglion being fed by melted &s;now and rain
in the mountains, is quite dry in &s;ummer;
but it is &s;ometimes &s;welled by &s;udden rains
to a very formidable torrent. This was the
ca&s;e in the year 1744, when the French and
Spani&s;h armies attacked eighteen Piedmon|te&s;e
battalions, which were po&s;ted on the
&s;ide of Montalban. The a&s;&s;ailants were re|pul&s;ed
with the lo&s;s of four thou&s;and men,
&s;ome hundreds of whom peri&s;hed in repa&s;&s;ing
the Paglion, which had &s;welled to a &s;urpri&s;ing
degree during the battle, in con&s;equence of
a heavy continued rain. This rain was of
great &s;ervice to the Piedmonte&s;e, as it pre|vented
one half of the enemy from pa&s;&s;ing
<PB N="219" REF="221">
the river to &s;u&s;tain the other. Five hundred
were taken pri&s;oners: but the Piedmonte&s;e,
fore&s;eeing they &s;hould be &s;urrounded next
day by the French, who had penetrated be|hind
them, by a pa&s;s in the mountains, re|tired
in the night. Being received on board
the Engli&s;h fleet, which lay at Villa Franca,
they were conveyed to Oneglia. In examin|ing
the bodies of tho&s;e that were killed in
the battle, the inhabitants of Nice perceived,
that a great number of the Spani&s;h &s;oldiers
were circumci&s;ed; a circum&s;tance, from
which they concluded, that a great many
Jews engage in the &s;ervice of his Catholic
maje&s;ty. I am of a different opinion. The
Jews are the lea&s;t of any people that I know,
addicted to a military life. I rather imagine
they were of the Moori&s;h race, who have
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted in Spain, &s;ince the expul&s;ion of their
brethren; and though they conform exter|nally
to the rites of the Catholic religion,
&s;till retain in private their attachment to the
law of Mahomet.</P>
<P>The city of Nice is built in form of an
irregular i&s;o&s;celes triangle, the ba&s;e of which
fronts the &s;ea. On the we&s;t &s;ide it is &s;ur|rounded
<PB N="220" REF="222">
by a wall and rampart; on the
ea&s;t, it is over-hung by a rock, on which
we &s;ee the ruins of an old ca&s;tle, which, be|fore
the invention of artillery, was counted
impregnable. It was taken and di&s;mantled
by marechal Catinat, in the time of Victor
Amadaeus, the father of his Sardinian ma|je&s;ty.
It was afterwards finally demoli&s;hed
by the duke of Berwick towards the latter
end of queen Anne's war. To repair it
would be a very unnece&s;&s;ary expence, as it
is commanded by Montalban, and &s;everal
other eminences.</P>
<P>The town of Nice is altogether indefen&s;ible,
and therefore without fortifications. There
are only two iron guns upon a ba&s;tion that
fronts the beach; and here the French had
formed a con&s;iderable battery again&s;t the
Engli&s;h crui&s;ers, in the war of 1744, when
the Mare&s;chal Duke de Bellei&s;le had his head
quarters at Nice. This little town, &s;ituated
in the bay of Antibes, is almo&s;t equidi&s;tant
from Mar&s;eilles, Turin, and Genoa, the
fir&s;t and la&s;t being about thirty leagues from
hence by &s;ea; and the capital of Piedmont
at the &s;ame di&s;tance to the northward, over
<PB N="221" REF="223">
the mountains. It lies exactly oppo&s;ite to
Capo di Ferro, on the coa&s;t of Barbary; and
the i&s;lands of Sardinia and Cor&s;ica are laid
down about two degrees to the ea&s;tward, al|mo&s;t
exactly in a line with Genoa. This little
town, hardly a mile in circumference, is &s;aid to
contain twelve thou&s;and inhabitants. The
&s;treets are narrow; the hou&s;es are built of
&s;tone, and the windows in general are fitted
with paper in&s;tead of gla&s;s. This expedient
would not an&s;wer in a country &s;ubject to rain
and &s;torms; but here, where there is very little
of either, the paper lozenges an&s;wer tolera|bly
well. The bourgeois, however, begin to
have their hou&s;es &s;ha&s;hed with gla&s;s. Between
the town-wall and the &s;ea, the fi&s;hermen
haul up their boats upon the open beach;
but on the other &s;ide of the rock, where the
ca&s;tle &s;tood, is the port or harbour of Nice,
upon which &s;ome money has been expended.
It is a &s;mall ba&s;in, defended to &s;eaward by
a mole of free-&s;tone, which is much better
contrived than executed: for the &s;ea has al|ready
made three breaches in it; and in all
probability, in another winter, the extremity
of it will be carried quite away. It would
<PB N="222" REF="224">
require the talents of a very &s;kilful architect
to lay the foundation of a good mole, on an
open beach like this; expo&s;ed to the &s;well of
the whole Mediterranean, without any i&s;land
or rock in the offing, to break the force of
the waves. Be&s;ides, the &s;hore is bold, and
the bottom foul. There are &s;eventeen feet of
water in the ba&s;in, &s;ufficient to float ve&s;&s;els
of one hundred and fifty ton; and this is
chiefly &s;upplied by a &s;mall &s;tream of very fine
water; another great convenience for &s;hip|ping.
On the &s;ide of the mole, there is a
con&s;tant guard of &s;oldiers, and a battery of
&s;even cannon, pointing to the &s;ea. On the
other &s;ide, there is a curious manufacture
for twi&s;ting or reeling &s;ilk; a tavern, a
coffee-hou&s;e, and &s;everal other buildings,
for the convenience of the &s;ea-faring people.
Without the harbour, is a lazarette, where
per&s;ons coming from infected places, are
obliged to perform quarantine. The har|bour
has been declared a free-port, and it is
generally full of tartanes, polacres, and other
&s;mall ve&s;&s;els, that come from Sardinia, Ivica,
Italy, and Spain, loaded with &s;alt, wine,
and other commodities; but here is no trade
of any great con&s;equence.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="225">
The city of Nice is provided with a &s;enate,
which admini&s;ters ju&s;tice under the au&s;pices
of an avocat-general, &s;ent hither by the king.
The internal oeconomy of the town is ma|naged
by four con&s;uls; one for the noble&s;&s;e,
another for the merchants, a third for the
bourgeois, and a fourth for the pea&s;ants.
The&s;e are cho&s;en annually from the town-council.
They keep the &s;treets and markets in
order, and &s;uperintend the public works.
There is al&s;o an intendant, who takes care
of his maje&s;ty's revenue: but there is a di&s;|cretionary
power lodged in the per&s;on of the
commandant, who is always an officer of
rank in the &s;ervice, and has under his imme|diate
command the regiment which is here
in garri&s;on. That which is here now is a
Swi&s;s battalion, of which the king has five
or &s;ix in his &s;ervice. There is likewi&s;e a re|giment
of militia, which is exerci&s;ed once a
year. But of all the&s;e particulars, I &s;hall
&s;peak more fully on another occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>When I &s;tand upon the rampart, and look
round me, I can &s;carce help thinking my&s;elf
inchanted. The &s;mall extent of country
which I &s;ee, is all cultivated like a garden.
<PB N="224" REF="226">
Indeed, the plain pre&s;ents nothing but gar|dens,
full of green trees, loaded with oran|ges,
lemons, citrons, and bergamots, which
make a delightful appearance. If you exa|mine
them more nearly, you will find plan|tations
of green pea&s;e ready to gather; all
&s;orts of &s;allading, and pot-herbs, in perfec|tion;
and plats of ro&s;es, carnations, ranun|culas,
anemonies, and daffodils, blowing in
full glory, with &s;uch beauty, vigour, and
perfume, as no flower in England ever exhi|bited.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t tell you, that pre&s;ents of carna|tions
are &s;ent from hence, in the winter, to
Turin and Paris; nay, &s;ometimes as far as
London, by the po&s;t. They are packed up
in a wooden box, without any &s;ort of prepa|ration,
one pre&s;&s;ed upon another: the per|&s;on
who receives them, cuts off a little bit
of the &s;talk, and &s;teeps them for two hours
in vinegar and water, when they recover
their full bloom and beauty. Then he places
them in water-bottles, in an apartment where
they are &s;creened from the &s;everities of the
weather; and they will continue fre&s;h and
unfaded, the be&s;t part of a month.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="227">
Amid&s;t the plantations in the neighbour|hood
of Nice, appear a va&s;t number of white
<HI>ba&s;tides,</HI> or country-hou&s;es, which make a
dazzling &s;hew. Some few of the&s;e are good
villas, belonging to the noble&s;&s;e of this coun|ty;
and even &s;ome of the bourgeois are pro|vided
with pretty lodgeable <HI>ca&s;&s;ines;</HI> but in
general, they are the habitations of the pea|&s;ants,
and contain nothing but mi&s;ery and
vermin. They are all built &s;quare; and, be|ing
whitened with lime or plai&s;ter, contri|bute
greatly to the richne&s;s of the view.
The hills are &s;haded to the tops with olive-trees,
which are always green; and tho&s;e
hills are over-topped by more di&s;tant moun|tains,
covered with &s;now. When I turn my|&s;elf
towards the &s;ea, the view is bounded by
the horizon; yet, in a clear morning, one
can perceive the high lands of Cor&s;ica. On
the right hand, it is terminated by Antibes,
and the mountain of E&s;terelles, which I de|&s;cribed
in my la&s;t. As for the weather, you
will conclude, from what I have &s;aid of the
oranges, flowers, &amp;c. that it mu&s;t be won|derfully
mild and &s;erene: but of the cli|mate,
I &s;hall &s;peak hereafter. Let me only
<PB N="226" REF="228">
ob&s;erve, <HI>en pa&s;&s;ant,</HI> that the hou&s;es in gene|ral
have no chimnies, but in their kitchens;
and that many people, even of condition,
at Nice, have no fire in their chambers, du|ring
the whole winter. When the weather
happens to be a little more &s;harp than u&s;ual,
they warm their apartments with a <HI>bra&s;iere</HI>
of charcoal.</P>
<P>Though Nice it&s;elf retains few marks of
antient &s;plendor, there are con&s;iderable mo|numents
of antiquity in its neighbourhood.
About two &s;hort miles from the town, upon
the &s;ummit of a pretty high hill, we find
the ruins of the antient city Cemenelion,
now called Cimia, which was once the me|tropolis
of the Maritime Alps, and the &s;eat
of a Roman pre&s;ident. With re&s;pect to &s;itu|ation,
nothing could be more agreeable or
&s;alubrious. It &s;tood upon the gentle a&s;cent
and &s;ummit of a hill, fronting the Mediter|ranean;
from the &s;hore of which, it is di&s;|tant
about half a league; and, on the other
&s;ide, it overlooked a bottom, or narrow vale,
through which the Paglion (antiently called
Paulo) runs towards the walls of Nice. It
was inhabited by a people, whom Ptolomy
<PB N="227" REF="229">
an d Pliny call the <HI>Vedantij:</HI> but the&s;e were
undoubtedly mixed with a Roman colony,
as appears by the monuments which &s;till re|main;
I mean the ruins of an amphitheatre,
a temple of Apollo, baths, aqueducts, &s;e|pulchral,
and other &s;tones, with in&s;crip|tions,
and a great number of medals, which
the pea&s;ants have found by accident, in dig|ging
and labouring the vineyards and corn|fields,
which now cover the ground where
the city &s;tood. Touching this city, very
little is to be learned from the antient hi&s;to|rians:
but that it was the &s;eat of a Roman

<P>I &s;hall give you one more &s;epulchral in|&s;cription

over the gate of the church belonging to the
convent of St. Pont, a venerable building,
which &s;tands at the bottom of the hill, front|ing
the north &s;ide of the town of Nice. This
<PB N="229" REF="231">
St. Pont, or Pontius, was a Roman convert
to Chri&s;tianity, who &s;uffered martyrdom at
Cemenelion in the year 261, during the
reigns of the emperors Valerian and Galli|enus.
The legends recount &s;ome ridiculous
miracles wrought in favour of this &s;aint,
both before and after his death. Charles V.
emperor of Germany and king of Spain,
cau&s;ed this mona&s;tery to be built on the &s;pot
where Pontius &s;uffered decapitation. But to

<P>The amphitheatre of Cemenelion is but
very &s;mall, compared to that of Ni&s;mes. The
arena is ploughed up, and bears corn: &s;ome
of the &s;eats remain, and part of two oppo|&s;ite
porticos; but all the columns, and the
external fa&ccedil;ade of the building, are taken
<PB N="230" REF="232">
away; &s;o that it is impo&s;&s;ible to judge of
the architecture: all that we can perceive
is, that it was built in an oval form. About
one hundred paces from the amphitheatre
&s;tood an antient temple, &s;upposed to have
been dedicated to Apollo. The original roof
is demoli&s;hed, as well as the portico; the
ve&s;tiges of which may &s;till be traced. The
part called the Ba&s;ilica, and about one half
of the Cella Sanctior, remain, and are con|verted
into the dwelling-hou&s;e and &s;table of
the pea&s;ant who takes care of the count de
Gubernatis's garden, in which this monu|ment
&s;tands. In the Cella Sanctior, I found
a lean cow, a he-goat, and a jack-a&s;s; the
very &s;ame conjunction of animals which I
had &s;een drawing a plough in Burgundy.
Several mutilated &s;tatues have been dug up
from the ruins of this temple; and a great
number of medals have been found in the
different vineyards which now occupy the
&s;pace upon which &s;tood the antient city of
Cemenelion. The&s;e were of gold, &s;ilver,
and bra&s;s. Many of them were pre&s;ented
to Charles Emanuel I. duke of Savoy. The
prince of Monaco has a good number of
<PB N="231" REF="233">
them in his collection; and the re&s;t are in
private hands. The pea&s;ants, in digging,
have likewi&s;e found many urns, lachrymato|ries,
and &s;epulchral &s;tones, with epitaphs,
which are now di&s;per&s;ed among different
convents and private hou&s;es. All this ground
is a rich mine of antiquities, which, if pro|perly
worked, would produce a great num|ber
of valuable curio&s;ities. Ju&s;t by the tem|ple
of Apollo were the ruins of a bath,
compo&s;ed of great blocks of marble, which
have been taken away for the purpo&s;es of
modern building. In all probability, many
other noble monuments of this city have
been dilapidated by the &s;ame barbarous oeco|nomy.
There are &s;ome &s;ubterranean vaults,
through which the water was conducted to
this bath, &s;till extant in the garden of the
count de Gubernatis. Of the aqueduct that
conveyed water to the town, I can &s;ay very
little, but that it was &s;cooped through a
mountain: that this &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;age was
di&s;covered &s;ome years ago, by removing the
rubbi&s;h which choaked it up: that the peo|ple
penetrating a con&s;iderable way, by the
help of lighted torches, found a very plenti|ful
<PB N="232" REF="234">
&s;tream of water flowing in an aqueduct,
as high as an ordinary man, arched over
head, and lined with a &s;ort of cement. They
could not, however, trace this &s;tream to its
&s;ource; and it is again &s;topped up with earth
and rubbi&s;h. There is not a &s;oul in this
country, who has either &s;pirit or under&s;tand|ing
to conduct an inquiry of this kind.
Hard by the amphitheatre is a convent of
Recollects, built in a very romantic &s;ituation,
on the brink of a precipice. On one &s;ide of
their garden, they a&s;cend to a kind of e&s;pla|nade,
which they &s;ay was part of the citadel
of Cemenelion. They have planted it with
cypre&s;s-trees, and flowering-&s;hrubs. One of
the monks told me, that it is vaulted below,
as they can plainly perceive by the &s;ound of
their in&s;truments u&s;ed in houghing the
ground. A very &s;mall expence would bring
the &s;ecrets of this cavern to light. They
have nothing to do, but to make a breach
in the wall, which appears uncovered to|wards
the garden.</P>
<P>The city of Cemenelion was first &s;acked
by the Longobards, who made an irruption
into Provence, under their king Alboinus,
<PB N="233" REF="235">
about the middle of the &s;ixth century. It
was afterwards totally de&s;troyed by the Sara|cens,
who, at different times, ravaged this
whole coa&s;t. The remains of the people are
&s;uppo&s;ed to have changed their habitation,
and formed a coalition with the inhabitants
of Nice.</P>
<P>What further I have to &s;ay of Nice, you
&s;hall know in good time; at pre&s;ent, I have
nothing to add, but what you very well
know, that I am always your affectionate
humble &s;ervant.</P>

<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>January 20, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>LAST Sunday I cro&s;&s;ed Montalban on
hor&s;eback, with &s;ome Swi&s;s officers, on
a vi&s;it to our con&s;ul, Mr. B&mdash;d, who
lives at Ville Franche, about half a league
from Nice. It is a &s;mall town, built upon
the &s;ide of a rock, at the bottom of the
harbour, which is a fine ba&s;in, &s;urrounded
with hills on every &s;ide, except to the &s;outh,
where it lies open to the &s;ea. If there was a
&s;mall i&s;land in the mouth of it, to break off
the force of the waves, when the wind is
&s;outherly, it would be one of the fine&s;t har|bours
in the world; for the ground is ex|ceeding
good for anchorage: there is a &s;uffi|cient
depth of water, and room enough for
the whole navy of England. On the right
hand, as you enter the port, there is an ele|gant
fanal, or light-hou&s;e, kept in good re|pair:
but in all the charts of this coa&s;t which
<PB N="235" REF="237">
I have &s;een, this lanthorn is laid down to the
we&s;tward of the harbour; an error equally
ab&s;urd and dangerous, as it may mi&s;lead the
navigator, and induce him to run his &s;hip
among the rocks, to the ea&s;tward of the
light-hou&s;e, where it would undoubtedly pe|ri&s;h.
Oppo&s;ite to the mouth of the harbour
is the fort, which can be of no &s;ervice, but
in defending the &s;hipping and the town by
&s;ea; for, by land, it is commanded by
Montalban, and all the hills in the neigh|bourhood.
In the war of 1744, it was taken
and re-taken. At pre&s;ent, it is in tolerable
good repair. On the left of the fort, is the
ba&s;in for the gallies, with a kind of dock, in
which they are built, and occa&s;ionally laid
up to be refitted. This ba&s;in is formed by a
pretty &s;tone mole; and here his Sardinian
maje&s;ty's two gallies lie perfectly &s;ecure,
moored with their &s;terns clo&s;e to the jett&eacute;. I
went on board one of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els, and &s;aw
about two hundred mi&s;erable wretches, chain|ed
to the banks on which they &s;it and row,
when the galley is at &s;ea. This is a &s;ight
which a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, &s;en&s;ible of the ble&s;|&s;ing
he enjoys, cannot behold without hor|ror
<PB N="236" REF="238">
and compa&s;&s;ion. Not but that if we con|&s;ider
the nature of the ca&s;e, with coolne&s;s
and deliberation, we mu&s;t acknowledge the
ju&s;tice, and even &s;agacity, of employing for
the &s;ervice of the public, tho&s;e malefactors
who have forfeited their title to the privi|leges
of the community. Among the &s;laves
at Ville Franche is a Piedmonte&s;e count,
condemned to the gallies for life, in con&s;e|quence
of having been convicted of forgery.</P>
<P>He is permitted to live on &s;hore; and gets
money by employing the other &s;laves to knit
&s;tockings for &s;ale. He appears always in the
Turki&s;h habit, and is in a fair way of rai|sing
a better fortune than that which he has
forfeited. It is a great pity, however, and a
manife&s;t outrage again&s;t the law of nations,
as well as of humanity, to mix with tho&s;e
banditti, the Moori&s;h and Turki&s;h pri&s;oners
who are taken in the pro&s;ecution of open
war. It is certainly no ju&s;tification of this
barbarous practice, that the Chri&s;tian pri&s;o|ners
are treated as cruelly at Tunis and Al|giers.
It would be for the honour of Chri&s;|tendom,
to &s;et an example of genero&s;ity to
the Turks; and, if they would not follow
<PB N="237" REF="239">
it, to join their naval forces, and extirpate
at once tho&s;e ne&s;ts of pirates, who have &s;o
long infe&s;ted the Mediterranean. Certainly,
nothing can be more &s;hameful, than the
treaties which France and the Maritime
Powers have concluded with tho&s;e barbarians.
They &s;upply them with artillery, arms, and
ammunition, to di&s;turb their neighbours.
They even pay them a &s;ort of tribute, under
the denomination of pre&s;ents; and often put
up with in&s;ults tamely, for the &s;ordid con&s;ide|ration
of a little gain in the way of commerce.
They know that Spain, Sardinia, and almo&s;t
all the Catholic powers in the Mediterranean,
Adriatic, and Levant, are at perpetual war
with tho&s;e Mahometans; that while Algiers,
Tunis, and Sallee, maintain armed crui&s;ers
at &s;ea, tho&s;e Chri&s;tian powers will not run
the ri&s;que of trading in their own bottoms,
but rather employ as carriers the maritime
nations, who are at peace with the infidels.
It is for our &s;hare of this advantage, that we
cultivate the piratical States of Barbary, and
meanly purcha&s;e pa&s;&s;ports of them, thus ac|knowledging
them ma&s;ters of the Mediterra|nean.</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="240">
The Sardinian gallies are mounted each
with five-and-twenty oars, and &s;ix guns, &s;ix-pounders,
of a &s;ide, and a large piece of ar|tillery
a mid&s;hips, pointing a-head, which
(&s;o far as I am able to judge) can never be
u&s;ed point-blank, without demoli&s;hing the
head or prow of the galley. The accommo|dation
on board for the officers is wretched.
There is a paltry cabin in the poop for the
commander; but all the other officers lie be|low
the &s;laves, in a dungeon, where they
have neither light, air, nor any degree of
quiet; half &s;uffocated by the heat of the
place; tormented by fleas, bugs, and lice;
and di&s;turbed by the ince&s;&s;ant noi&s;e over
head. The &s;laves lie upon the naked banks,
without any other covering than a tilt. This,
however, is no great hard&s;hip, in a climate
where there is a &s;carce any winter. They are
fed with a very &s;canty allowance of bread,
and about fourteen beans a day; and twice
a week they have a little rice, or chee&s;e: but
mo&s;t of them, while they are in harbour,
knit &s;tockings, or do &s;ome other kind of
work, which enables them to make &s;ome ad|dition
to this wretched allowance. When
<PB N="239" REF="241">
they happen to be at &s;ea in bad weather,
their &s;ituation is truly deplorable. Every
wave breaks over the ve&s;&s;el, and not only
keeps them continually wet, but comes with
&s;uch force, that they are da&s;hed again&s;t the
banks with &s;urpri&s;ing violence: &s;ometimes
their limbs are broke, and &s;ometimes their
brains da&s;hed out. It is impo&s;&s;ible (they &s;ay)
to keep &s;uch a number of de&s;perate people
under any regular command, without exer|ci&s;ing
&s;uch &s;everities as mu&s;t &s;hock humanity.
It is almo&s;t equally impo&s;&s;ible to maintain
any tolerable degree of cleanline&s;s, where
&s;uch a number of wretches are crouded to|gether
without conveniences, or even the ne|ce&s;&s;aries
of life. They are ordered twice a
week to &s;trip, clean, and bathe them&s;elves in
the &s;ea: but, notwith&s;tanding all the precau|tions
of di&s;cipline, they &s;warm with vermin,
and the ve&s;&s;el &s;mells like an ho&s;pital, or
crouded jail. They &s;eem, neverthele&s;s, quite
in&s;en&s;ible of their mi&s;ery, like &s;o many con|victs
in Newgate: they laugh and &s;ing, and
&s;wear, and get drunk when they can. When
you enter by the &s;tern, you are welcomed by
a band of mu&s;ick &s;elected from the &s;laves;
<PB N="240" REF="242">
and the&s;e expect a gratification. If you walk
forwards, you mu&s;t take care of your pock|ets.
You will be acco&s;ted by one or other of
the &s;laves, with a bru&s;h and blacking-ball for
cleaning your &s;hoes; and if you undergo
this operation, it is ten to one but your pocket
is picked. If you decline his &s;ervice, and
keep aloof, you will find it almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
to avoid a colony of vermin, which the&s;e fel|lows
have a very dextrous method of convey|ing
to &s;trangers. Some of the Turki&s;h pri|&s;oners,
who&s;e ran&s;om or exchange is expected,
are allowed to go a&s;hore, under proper in|&s;pection;
and tho&s;e <HI>for&ccedil;ats,</HI> who have &s;erved
the be&s;t part of the time for which they were
condemned, are employed in public works,
under a guard of &s;oldiers. At the harbour
of Nice, they are hired by &s;hip-ma&s;ters to
bring balla&s;t, and have a &s;mall proportion of
what they earn, for their own u&s;e: the re&s;t
belongs to the king. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed
by an iron &s;hackle about one of their legs.
The road from Nice to Ville Franche is
&s;carce pa&s;&s;able on hor&s;eback: a circum&s;tance
the more extraordinary, as tho&s;e &s;laves, in
the &s;pace of two or three months, might
<PB N="241" REF="243">
even make it fit for a carriage, and the king
would not be one farthing out of pocket,
for they are quite idle the greate&s;t part of
the year.</P>
<P>The gallies go to &s;ea only in the &s;ummer.
In tempe&s;tuous weather, they could not live
out of port. Indeed, they are good for no|thing
but in &s;mooth water, during a calm;
when, by dint of rowing, they make good
way. The king of Sardinia is &s;o &s;en&s;ible of
their inutility, that he intends to let his gal|lies
rot; and, in lieu of them, has purcha&s;ed
two large frigates in England, one of fifty,
and another of thirty guns, which are now
in the harbour of Ville Franche. He has
al&s;o procured an Engli&s;h officer, one Mr.
A&mdash;, who is &s;econd in command on
board of one of them, and has the title of
captain <HI>con&s;ulteur,</HI> that is, in&s;tructor to the
fir&s;t captain, the marquis de M&mdash;i, who
knows as little of &s;eaman&s;hip as I do of
Arabic.</P>
<P>The king, it is &s;aid, intends to have two
or three more frigates, and then he will be
more than a match for the Barbary cor&s;airs,
provided care be taken to man his fleet in a
<PB N="242" REF="244">
proper manner: but this will never be done,
unle&s;s he invites foreigners into his &s;ervice,
officers as well as &s;eamen; for his own do|minions
produce neither at pre&s;ent. If he is
really determined to make the mo&s;t of the
maritime &s;ituation of his dominions, as well
as of his alliance with Great-Britain, he
ought to &s;upply his &s;hips with Engli&s;h mari|ners,
and put a Briti&s;h commander at the
head of his fleet. He ought to erect maga|zines
and docks at Villa Franca; or if there
is not conveniency for building, he may at
lea&s;t have pits and wharfs for heaving down
and careening; and the&s;e ought to be under
the direction of Engli&s;hmen, who be&s;t un|der&s;tand
all the particulars of marine oeco|nomy.
Without all doubt, he will not be
able to engage foreigners, without giving
them liberal appointments; and their being
engaged in his &s;ervice will give umbrage to
his own &s;ubjects: but, when the bu&s;ine&s;s is
to e&s;tabli&s;h a maritime power, the&s;e con&s;ide|rations
ought to be &s;acrificed to rea&s;ons of
public utility. Nothing can be more ab&s;urd
and unrea&s;onable, than the murmurs of the
Piedmonte&s;e officers at the preferment of fo|reigners,
<PB N="243" REF="245">
who execute tho&s;e things for the
advantage of their country, of which they
know them&s;elves incapable. When Mr.
P&mdash;n was fir&s;t promoted in the &s;ervice of
his Sardinian maje&s;ty, he met with great op|po&s;ition,
and numberle&s;s mortifications, from
the jealou&s;y of the Piedmonte&s;e officers, and
was obliged to hazard his life in many ren|counters
with them, before they would be
quiet. Being a man of uncommon &s;pirit,
he never &s;uffered the lea&s;t in&s;ult or affront to
pa&s;s uncha&s;ti&s;ed. He had repeated opportu|nities
of &s;ignalizing his valour again&s;t the
Turks; and by dint of extraordinary merit,
and long &s;ervices, not only attained the chief
command of the gallies, with the rank of
lieutenant-general, but al&s;o acquired a very
con&s;iderable &s;hare of the king's favour, and
was appointed commandant of Nice. His
Sardinian maje&s;ty found his account more
ways than one, in thus promoting Mr.
P&mdash;n. He made the acqui&s;ition of an ex|cellent
officer, of tried courage and fidelity,
by who&s;e advice he conducted his marine af|fairs.
This gentleman was perfectly well
e&s;teemed at the court of London. In the
<PB N="244" REF="246">
war of 1744, he lived in the utmo&s;t harmo|ny
with the Briti&s;h admirals who commanded
our fleet in the Mediterranean. In con&s;e|quence
of this good under&s;tanding, a thou|&s;and
occa&s;ional &s;ervices were performed by
the Engli&s;h &s;hips, for the benefit of his ma&s;|ter,
which otherwi&s;e could not have been
done, without a formal application to our
mini&s;try; in which ca&s;e, the opportunities
would have been lo&s;t. I know our admirals
had general orders and in&s;tructions, to co|operate
in all things with his Sardinian ma|je&s;ty;
but I know, al&s;o, by experience, how
little the&s;e general in&s;tructions avail, when
the admiral is not cordially intere&s;ted in the
&s;ervice. Were the king of Sardinia at pre|&s;ent
engaged with England in a new war
again&s;t France, and a Briti&s;h &s;quadron &s;ta|tioned
upon this coa&s;t, as formerly, he would
find a great difference in this particular. He
&s;hould therefore carefully avoid having at
Nice a Savoyard commandant, utterly igno|rant
of &s;ea affairs; unacquainted with the
true intere&s;t of his ma&s;ter; proud, and ar|bitrary;
re&s;erved to &s;trangers, from a pre|judice
of national jealou&s;y; and particularly
aver&s;e to the Engli&s;h.</P>
<P><PB N="245" REF="247">
With re&s;pect to the antient name of Villa
Franca, there is a di&s;pute among antiquarians.
It is not at all mentioned in the <HI>Itinerarium</HI> of
Antoninus, unle&s;s it is meant as the port of
Nice. But it is more &s;urpri&s;ing, that the ac|curate
Strabo, in de&s;cribing this coa&s;t, men|tions
no &s;uch harbour. Some people ima|gine
it is the Portus Herculis Monaeci. But
this is undoubtedly what is now called Mona|co;
the harbour of which exactly tallies with
what Strabo &s;ays of the Portus Monaeci&mdash;
<HI>neque magnas, neque multas capit naves.</HI> Pto|lomy,
indeed, &s;eems to mention it under the
name of Herculis Portus, different from the
Portus Monaeci. His words are the&s;e: <HI>po&s;t
vari o&s;tium ad Ligu&s;trium mare, ma&s;&s;ilien&s;ium
&s;unt</HI> Nicaea, <HI>Herculis Portus, Trophaea Augu&s;ti,
Monaeci Portus.</HI> In that ca&s;e, Hercules was
wor&s;hipped both here and at Monaco, and
gave his name to both places. But on this
&s;ubject, I &s;hall perhaps &s;peak more fully in
another letter, after I have &s;een the <HI>Trophaea
Augu&s;ti,</HI> now called Tourbia, and the town
of Monaco, which la&s;t is about three leagues
from Nice. Here I cannot help taking notice
of the following elegant de&s;cription from the
<PB N="246" REF="248">
Phar&s;alia, which &s;eems to have been in|tended
for this very harbour.</P>
<Q><L>Finis et He&s;periae promoto milite varus,</L>

<P>The pre&s;ent town of Villa Franca was
built and &s;ettled in the thirteenth century,
by order of Charles II. king of the Sicilies,
and count of Provence, in order to defend
the harbour from the de&s;cents of the Sara|cens,
who at that time infe&s;ted the coa&s;t.
The inhabitants were removed hither from
another town, &s;ituated on the top of a
mountain in the neighbourhood, which tho&s;e
pirates had de&s;troyed. Some ruins of the
old town are &s;till extant. In order to &s;e|cure
the harbour &s;till more effectually, Ema|nuel
Philibert, duke of Savoy, built the fort
in the beginning of the la&s;t century, toge|ther
with the mole where the gallies are
moored. As I &s;aid before, Ville Franche is
<PB N="247" REF="249">
built on the face of a barren rock, wa&s;hed
by the &s;ea; and there is not an acre of plain
ground within a mile of it. In &s;ummer, the
reflexion of the &s;un from the rocks mu&s;t
make it intolerably hot; for even at this
time of the year, I walked my&s;elf into a pro|fu&s;e
&s;weat, by going about a quarter of a
mile to &s;ee the gallies.</P>

<SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN your favour which I received by Mr.
M&mdash;1, you remind me of my promi&s;e,
to communicate the remarks I have &s;till to
make on the French nation; and at the &s;ame
time you &s;ignify your opinion, that I am too
&s;evere in my former ob&s;ervations. You even
hint a &s;u&s;picion, that this &s;everity is owing
<PB N="248" REF="250">
to &s;ome per&s;onal cau&s;e of re&s;entment; but,
I prote&s;t, I have no particular cau&s;e of
animo&s;ity again&s;t any individual of that
country. I have neither obligation to, nor
quarrel with, any &s;ubject of France; and
when I meet with a Frenchman worthy of
my e&s;teem, I can receive him into my friend|&s;hip
with as much cordiality, as I could feel
for any fellow citizen of the &s;ame merit. I
even re&s;pect the nation, for the number of
great men it has produced in all arts and
&s;ciences. I re&s;pect the French officers, in
particular, for their gallantry and valour;
and e&s;pecially for that generous humanity
which they exerci&s;e towards their enemies,
even amid&s;t the horrors of war. This libe|ral
&s;pirit is the only circum&s;tance of antient
chivalry, which I think was worth pre&s;erving.
It had formerly flouri&s;hed in England, but
was almo&s;t extingui&s;hed in a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
civil wars, which are always productive of
cruelty and rancour. It was Henry IV. of
France, (a real knight errant) who revived
it in Europe. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that greatne&s;s of
mind, which can forgive injuries of the
deepe&s;t dye: and as he had al&s;o the faculty
<PB N="249" REF="251">
of di&s;tingui&s;hing characters, he found his
account, in favouring with his friend&s;hip and
confidence, &s;ome of tho&s;e who had oppo&s;ed
him in the field with the mo&s;t inveterate per|&s;everance.
I know not whether he did more
&s;ervice to mankind in general, by reviving
the practice of treating his pri&s;oners with ge|nero&s;ity,
than he prejudiced his own country
by patronizing the ab&s;urd and pernicious
cu&s;tom of duelling, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a <HI>punto,</HI>
founded in diametrical oppo&s;ition to common
&s;en&s;e and humanity.</P>
<P>I have often heard it ob&s;erved, that a
French officer is generally an agreeable com|panion
when he is turned of fifty. Without
all doubt, by that time, the fire of his viva|city,
which makes him &s;o trouble&s;ome in his
youth, will be con&s;iderably abated, and in
other re&s;pects, he mu&s;t be improved by his
experience. But there is a fundamental error
in the fir&s;t principles of his education, which
time rather confirms than removes. Early
prejudices are for the mo&s;t part converted into
habits of thinking; and accordingly you will
find the old officers in the French &s;ervice
<PB N="250" REF="252">
more bigotted than their juniors, to the
punctilios of fal&s;e honour.</P>
<P>A lad of a good family no &s;ooner enters
into the &s;ervice, than he thinks it incumbent
upon him to &s;hew his courage in a rencon|tre.
His natural vivacity prompts him to
hazard in company every thing that comes
uppermo&s;t, without any re&s;pect to his &s;e|niors
or betters; and ten to one but he &s;ays
&s;omething, which he finds it nece&s;&s;ary to
maintain with his &s;word. The old officer,
in&s;tead of checking his petulance, either by
rebuke or &s;ilent di&s;approbation, &s;eems to be
plea&s;ed with his impertinence, and encou|rages
every &s;ally of his pre&s;umption. Should
a quarrel en&s;ue, and the parties go out, he
makes no efforts to compromi&s;e the di&s;pute;
but &s;its with a plea&s;ing expectation to learn
the i&s;&s;ue of the rencontre. If the young
man is wounded, he ki&s;&s;es him with tran&s;|port,
extols his bravery, puts him into the
hands of the &s;urgeon, and vi&s;its him with
great tenderne&s;s every day, until he is cured.
If he is killed on the &s;pot, he &s;hrugs up his
&s;houlders&mdash;&s;ays, <HI>quelle dommage! c'&eacute;toit un
aimable enfant! ah, patience!</HI> and in three
<PB N="251" REF="253">
hours the defunct is forgotten. You know,
in France, duels are forbid, on pain of
death: but this law is ea&s;ily evaded. The
per&s;on in&s;ulted walks out; the antagoni&s;t un|der&s;tands
the hint, and follows him into the
&s;treet, where they ju&s;tle as if by accident,
draw their &s;words, and one of them is either
killed or di&s;abled, before any effectual means
can be u&s;ed to part them. Whatever may
be the i&s;&s;ue of the combat, the magi&s;trate
takes no cognizance of it; at lea&s;t, it is in|terpreted
into an accidental rencounter, and
no penalty is incurred on either &s;ide. Thus
the purpo&s;e of the law is entirely defeated,
by a mo&s;t ridiculous and cruel connivance.
The meere&s;t trifles in conver&s;ation, a ra&s;h
word, a di&s;tant hint, even a look or &s;mile of
contempt, is &s;ufficient to produce one of
the&s;e combats; but injuries of a deeper dye,
&s;uch as terms of reproach, the lie direct, a
blow, or even the menace of a blow, mu&s;t
be di&s;cu&s;&s;ed with more formality. In any of
the&s;e ca&s;es, the parties agree to meet in the
dominions of another prince, where they
can murder each other, without fear of pu|ni&s;hment.
An officer who is &s;truck, or even
<PB N="252" REF="254">
threatened with a blow, mu&s;t not be quiet,
until he either kills his antagoni&s;t, or lo&s;es
his own life. A friend of mine, (a Ni&s;&s;ard)
who was in the &s;ervice of France, told me,
that &s;ome years ago, one of their captains,
in the heat of pa&s;&s;ion, &s;truck his lieutenant.
They fought immediately: the lieutenant
was wounded and di&s;armed. As it was an
affront that could not be made up, he no
&s;ooner recovered of his wounds, than he
called out the captain a &s;econd time. In a
word, they fought five times before the com|bat
proved deci&s;ive; at la&s;t, the lieutenant
was left dead on the &s;pot. This was an
event which &s;ufficiently proved the ab&s;urdity
of the punctilio that gave ri&s;e to it. The
poor gentleman who was in&s;ulted, and out|raged
by the brutality of the aggre&s;&s;or, found
him&s;elf under the nece&s;&s;ity of giving him a
further occa&s;ion to take away his life. Ano|ther
adventure of the &s;ame kind happened
a few years ago in this place. A French
officer having threatened to &s;trike another, a
formal challenge en&s;ued; and it being agreed
that they &s;hould fight until one of them
dropped, each provided him&s;elf with a cou|ple
<PB N="253" REF="255">
of pioneers to dig his grave on the &s;pot.
They engaged ju&s;t without one of the gates
of Nice, in pre&s;ence of a great number of
&s;pectators, and fought with &s;urpri&s;ing fury,
until the ground was drenched with their
blood. At length one of them &s;tumbled, and
fell; upon which the other, who found him|&s;elf
mortally wounded, advancing, and drop|ping
his point, &s;aid, &startq;<HI>Je te donne ce que tu
m'as ot&eacute;.</HI>&endq; &startq;I give thee that which thou
ha&s;t taken from me.&endq; So &s;aying, he dropped
dead upon the field. The other, who had
been the per&s;on in&s;ulted, was &s;o dangerou&s;ly
wounded, that he could not ri&s;e. Some of
the &s;pectators carried him forthwith to the
beach, and putting him into a boat, con|veyed
him by &s;ea to Antibes. The body of
his antagoni&s;t was denied Chri&s;tian burial,
as he died without ab&s;olution, and every
body allowed that his &s;oul went to hell: but
the gentlemen of the army declared, that he
died like a man of honour. Should a man
be never &s;o well inclined to make atonement
in a peaceable manner, for an in&s;ult given in
the heat of pa&s;&s;ion, or in the fury of intoxi|cation,
it cannot be received. Even an in|voluntary
<PB N="254" REF="256">
tre&s;pa&s;s from ignorance, or ab|&s;ence
of mind, mu&s;t be clean&s;ed with blood.
A certain noble lord, of our country, when
he was yet a commoner, on his travels, in|volved
him&s;elf in a dilemma of this &s;ort, at
the court of Lorrain. He had been riding
out, and &s;trolling along a public walk, in a
brown &s;tudy, with his hor&s;e-whip in his
hand, perceived a caterpillar crawling on the
back of a marquis, who chanced to be be|fore
him. He never thought of the <HI>petit
maitre;</HI> but lifting up his whip, in order to
kill the in&s;ect, laid it acro&s;s his &s;houlders
with a crack, that alarmed all the company
in the walk. The marquis's &s;word was pro|duced
in a moment, and the aggre&s;&s;or in
great hazard of his life, as he had no wea|pon
of defence. He was no &s;ooner waked
from his reverie, than he begged pardon,
and offered to make all proper conce&s;&s;ions
for what he had done through mere inad|vertency.
The marquis would have admitted
his excu&s;es, had there been any precedent of
&s;uch an affront wa&s;hed away without blood.
A conclave of honour was immediately a&s;|&s;embled;
and after long di&s;putes, they agreed,
<PB N="255" REF="257">
that an involuntary offence, e&s;pecially from
<HI>&s;uch a kind of man, d'un tel homme,</HI> might be
attoned by conce&s;&s;ions. That you may have
&s;ome idea of the &s;mall beginning, from
which many gigantic quarrels ari&s;e, I &s;hall
recount one that lately happened at Lyons,
as I had it from the mouth of a per&s;on who
was an ear and eye-witne&s;s of the tran&s;action.
Two Frenchmen, at a public ordinary,
&s;tunned the re&s;t of the company with their
loquacity. At length one of them, with a
&s;upercilious air, a&s;ked the other's name. &startq;I
never tell my name, (&s;aid he) but in a whi&s;|per.&endq;
&startq;You may have very good rea&s;ons
for keeping it &s;ecret,&endq; replied the fir&s;t. &startq;I
will tell you,&endq; (re&s;umed the other): with
the&s;e words, he ro&s;e; and going round to
him, pronounced, loud enough to be heard
by the whole company, &startq;<HI>Je m'appelle Pierre
Pay&s;an; et vous etes un impertinent.</HI>&endq; So &s;ay|ing,
he walked out: the interrogator fol|lowed
him into the &s;treet, where they ju&s;tled,
drew their &s;words, and engaged. He who
a&s;ked the que&s;tion was run through the
body; but his relations were &s;o powerful,
that the victor was obliged to fly his country.
<PB N="256" REF="258">
He was tried and condemned in his ab&s;ence;
his goods were confi&s;cated; his wife broke
her heart; his children were reduced to beg|gary;
and he him&s;elf is now &s;tarving in ex|ile.
In England, we have not yet adopted
all the implacability of the punctilio. A gen|tleman
may be in&s;ulted even with a blow,
and &s;urvive, after having once hazarded his
life again&s;t the aggre&s;&s;or. The laws of ho|nour
in our country do not oblige him ei|ther
to &s;lay the per&s;on from whom he re|ceived
the injury, or even to fight to the la&s;t
drop of his own blood. One finds no exam|ples
of duels among the Romans, who were
certainly as brave and as delicate in their no|tions
of honour, as the French. Cornelius
Nepos tells us, that a famous Athenian ge|neral,
having a di&s;pute with his colleague,
who was of Sparta, a man of a fiery di&s;po|&s;ition,
this la&s;t lifted up his cane to &s;trike
him. Had this happened to a French <HI>petit
maitre,</HI> death mu&s;t have en&s;ued: but mark
what followed.&mdash;The Athenian, far from
re&s;enting the outrage, in what is now called
a gentleman-like manner, &s;aid, &startq;do, &s;trike
if you plea&s;e; but hear me.&endq; He never
<PB N="257" REF="259">
dreamed of cutting the Lacedemonian's throat;
but bore with his pa&s;&s;ionate temper, as the
infirmity of a friend who had a thou&s;and
good qualities to overbalance that defect.</P>
<P>I need not expatiate upon the folly and the
mi&s;chief which are countenanced and pro|moted
by the modern practice of duelling.
I need not give examples of friends who have
murdered each other, in obedience to this &s;a|vage
cu&s;tom, even while their hearts were melt|ing
with mutual tenderne&s;s; nor will I par|ticularize
the in&s;tances which I my&s;elf know,
of whole families ruined, of women and chil|dren
made widows and orphans, of parents de|prived
of only &s;ons, and of valuable lives lo&s;t to
the community, by duels, which had been pro|duced
by one unguarded expre&s;&s;ion, uttered
without intention of offence, in the heat of
di&s;pute and altercation. I &s;hall not in&s;i&s;t upon
the hard&s;hip of a worthy man's being oblig|ed
to devote him&s;elf to death, becau&s;e it is his
misfortune to be in&s;ulted by a brute, a bully,
a drunkard, or a madman: neither will I
enlarge upon this &s;ide of the ab&s;urdity, which
indeed amounts to a contradiction in terms;
I mean the dilemma to which a gentleman
<PB N="258" REF="260">
in the army is reduced, when he receives an
affront: if he does not challenge and fight his
antagoni&s;t, he is broke with infamy by a
court-martial; if he fights and kills him, he
is tried by the civil power, convicted of mur|der,
and, if the royal mercy does not inter|po&s;e,
he is infallibly hanged: all this, ex|clu&s;ive
of the ri&s;que of his own life in the
duel, and his con&s;cience being burthened
with the blood of a man, whom perhaps he
has &s;acrificed to a fal&s;e punctilio, even con|trary
to his own judgment. The&s;e are reflec|tions
which I know your own good &s;en&s;e
will &s;ugge&s;t, but I will make bold to propo&s;e
a remedy for this gigantic evil, which &s;eems
to gain ground every day: let a court be in|&s;tituted
for taking cognizance of all breaches
of honour, with power to puni&s;h by fine,
pillory, &s;entence of infamy, outlawry, and
exile, by virtue of an act of parliament made
for this purpo&s;e; and all per&s;ons in&s;ulted,
&s;hall have recour&s;e to this tribunal: let every
man who &s;eeks per&s;onal reparation with
&s;word, pi&s;tol, or other in&s;trument of death,
be declared infamous, and bani&s;hed the king|dom:
let every man, convicted of having u&s;ed
<PB N="259" REF="261">
a &s;word or pi&s;tol, or other mortal weapon,
again&s;t another, either in duel or rencountre,
occa&s;ioned by any previous quarrel, be &s;ubject
to the &s;ame penalties: if any man is killed
in a duel, let his body be hanged upon a
public gibbet, for a certain time, and then
given to the &s;urgeons: let his antagoni&s;t be
hanged as a murderer, and di&s;&s;ected al&s;o;
and &s;ome mark of infamy be &s;et on the me|mory
of both. I apprehend &s;uch regulations
would put an effectual &s;top to the practice of
duelling, which nothing but the fear of in|famy
can &s;upport; for I am per&s;uaded, that
no being, capable of reflection, would pro|&s;ecute
the trade of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination at the ri&s;que
of his own life, if this hazard was at the
&s;ame time reinforced by the certain pro&s;pect
of infamy and ruin. Every per&s;on of &s;enti|ment
would in that ca&s;e allow, that an offi|cer,
who in a duel robs a de&s;erving woman
of her hu&s;band, a number of children of their
father, a family of its &s;upport, and the com|munity
of a fellow citizen, has as little me|rit
to plead from expo&s;ing his own per&s;on,
as a highwayman, or hou&s;ebreaker, who every
day ri&s;ques his life to rob or plunder that
<PB N="260" REF="262">
which is not of half the importance to &s;ociety.
I think it was from the Buccaneers of Ame|rica,
that the Engli&s;h have learned to aboli&s;h
one &s;oleci&s;m in the practice of duelling: tho&s;e
adventurers decided their per&s;onal quarrels
with pi&s;tols; and this improvement has been
adopted in Great Britain with good &s;ucce&s;s;
though in France, and other parts of the con|tinent,
it is looked upon as a proof of their
barbarity. It is, however, the only circum|&s;tance
of duelling, which &s;avours of common
&s;en&s;e, as it puts all mankind upon a level,
the old with the young, the weak with the
&s;trong, the unwieldy with the nimble, and
the man who knows not how to hold a &s;word
with the <HI>&s;pada&s;&s;in,</HI> who has practi&s;ed fenc|ing
from the cradle. What glory is there
in a man's vanqui&s;hing an adver&s;ary over
whom he has a manife&s;t advantage? To
abide the i&s;&s;ue of a combat in this ca&s;e, does
not even require that moderate &s;hare of re&s;o|lution
which nature has indulged to her com|mon
children. Accordingly, we have &s;een
many in&s;tances of a coward's provoking a
man of honour to battle. In the reign of
our &s;econd Charles, when duels flouri&s;hed in
<PB N="261" REF="263">
all their ab&s;urdity, and the &s;econds fought
while their principals were engaged, Villiers,
Duke of Buckingham, not content with hav|ing
debauched the counte&s;s of Shrew&s;bury,
and publi&s;hing her &s;hame, took all opportu|nities
of provoking the earl to &s;ingle combat,
hoping he &s;hould have an ea&s;y conque&s;t, his
lord&s;hip being a puny little creature, quiet,
inoffen&s;ive, and every way unfit for &s;uch per|&s;onal
conte&s;ts. He ridiculed him on all oc|ca&s;ions;
and at la&s;t declared in public com|pany,
that there was no glory in cuckolding
Shrew&s;bury, who had not &s;pirit to re&s;ent the
injury. This was an in&s;ult which could not
be overlooked. The earl &s;ent him a chal|lenge;
and they agreed to fight, at Barns-Elms,
in pre&s;ence of two gentlemen, whom
they cho&s;e for their &s;econds. All the four
engaged at the &s;ame time: the fir&s;t thru&s;t
was fatal to the earl of Shrew&s;bury; and his
friend killed the duke's &s;econd at the &s;ame
in&s;tant. Buckingham, elated with his ex|ploit,
&s;et out immediately for the earl's &s;eat
at Cliefden, where he lay with his wife, after
having boa&s;ted of the murder of her hu&s;band,
who&s;e blood he &s;hewed her upon his &s;word,
<PB N="262" REF="264">
as a trophy of his prowe&s;s. But this very
duke of Buckingham was little better than
a poltroon at bottom. When the gallant earl
of O&s;&s;ory challenged him to fight in Chel&s;ea
fields, he cro&s;&s;ed the water to Batter&s;ea, where
he pretended to wait for his lord&s;hip; and
then complained to the hou&s;e of lords, that
O&s;&s;ory had given him the rendezvous, and
did not keep his appointment. He knew the
hou&s;e would interpo&s;e in the quarrel, and he
was not di&s;appointed. Their lord&s;hips obliged
them both to give their word of honour, that
their quarrel &s;hould have no other con&s;e|quences.</P>
<P>I ought to make an apology for having
troubled a lady with &s;o many ob&s;ervations
on a &s;ubject &s;o un&s;uitable to the &s;oftne&s;s of

<HEAD>LETTER XVI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>May 2, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>A Few days ago, I rode out with two gen|tlemen
of this country, to &s;ee a &s;tream
of water which was formerly conveyed in an
aqueduct to the antient city of Cemenelion,
from whence this place is di&s;tant about a
mile, though &s;eparated by abrupt rocks and
deep hollows, which la&s;t are here honoured
with the name of vallies. The water, which
is exqui&s;itely cool, and light and pure, gu&s;hes
from the middle of a rock by a hole which
leads to a &s;ubterranean aqueduct carried
through the middle of the mountain. This
is a Roman work, and the more I con&s;idered
it, appeared the more &s;tupendous. A pea|&s;ant
who lives upon the &s;pot told us, he had
entered by this hole at eight in the morning,
and advanced &s;o far, that it was four in the
afternoon before he came out. He &s;aid he
walked in the water, through a regular ca|nal
<PB N="264" REF="266">
formed of a hard &s;tone, lined with a kind
of cement, and vaulted over-head; but &s;o
high in mo&s;t parts he could &s;tand upright,
yet in others, the bed of the canal was &s;o
filled with earth and &s;tones, that he was
obliged to &s;toop in pa&s;&s;ing. He &s;aid that
there were air-holes at certain di&s;tances (and
indeed I &s;aw one of the&s;e not far from the
pre&s;ent i&s;&s;ue) that there were &s;ome openings
and &s;tone &s;eats on the &s;ides, and here and
there figures of men formed of &s;tone, with
hammers and working tools in their hands.
I am apt to believe the fellow romanced a lit|tle,
in order to render his adventure the more
marvellous: but I am certainly informed, that
&s;everal per&s;ons have entered this pa&s;&s;age, and
proceeded a con&s;iderable way by the light of
torches, without arriving at the &s;ource, which
(if we may believe the tradition of the coun|try)
is at the di&s;tance of eight leagues from
this opening; but this is altogether incredi|ble.
The &s;tream is now called <HI>la fontaine de
muraille,</HI> and is carefully conducted by diffe|rent
branches into the adjacent vineyards and
gardens, for watering the ground. On the
&s;ide of the &s;ame mountain, more &s;outherly,
<PB N="265" REF="267">
at the di&s;tance of half a mile, there is ano|ther
&s;till more copious di&s;charge of the &s;ame
kind of water, called <HI>la &s;ource du temple.</HI> It
was conveyed through the &s;ame kind of pa&s;|&s;age,
and put to the &s;ame u&s;e as the other;
and I &s;hould imagine they are both from the
&s;ame &s;ource, which, though hitherto undi&s;|covered,
mu&s;t be at a con&s;iderable di&s;tance,
as the mountain is continued for &s;everal
leagues to the we&s;tward, without exhibiting
the lea&s;t &s;igns of water in any other part.
But, exclu&s;ive of the &s;ubterranean conduits,
both the&s;e &s;treams mu&s;t have been conveyed
through aqueducts extending from hence to
Cemenelion over &s;teep rocks and deep ravines,
at a prodigious expence. The water from
this <HI>&s;ource du temple,</HI> i&s;&s;ues from a &s;tone build|ing
which covers the pa&s;&s;age in the rock. It
&s;erves to turn &s;everal olive, corn, and paper
mills, being conveyed through a modern
aqueduct rai&s;ed upon a paultry arcade at
the expence of the public, and afterwards is
branched off in very &s;mall &s;treams, for the be|nefit
of this parched and barren country.
The Romans were &s;o u&s;ed to bathing, that
they could not exi&s;t without a great quan|tity
<PB N="266" REF="268">
of water; and this, I imagine, is one
rea&s;on that induced them to &s;pare no labour
and expence in bringing it from a di&s;tance,
when they had not plenty of it at home.
But, be&s;ides this motive, they had ano|ther:
they were &s;o nice and delicate in their
ta&s;te of water, that they took great pains to
&s;upply them&s;elves with the pure&s;t and lighte&s;t
from afar, for drinking and culinary u&s;es,
even while they had plenty of an inferior &s;ort
for their baths, and other dome&s;tic purpo&s;es.
There are &s;prings of good water on the &s;pot
where Cemenelion &s;tood: but there is a hard|ne&s;s
in all well-water, which quality is de|po&s;ited
in running a long cour&s;e, e&s;pecially
if expo&s;ed to the influence of the &s;un and
air. The Romans, therefore, had good rea|&s;on
to &s;often and meliorate this element, by
conveying it a good length of way in open
aqueducts. What was u&s;ed in the baths of
Cemenelion, they probably brought in leaden
pipes, &s;ome of which have been dug up very
lately by accident. You mu&s;t know, I made
a &s;econd excur&s;ion to the&s;e antient ruins, and
mea&s;ured the arena of the amphitheatre with
pack thread. It is an oval figure; the longe&s;t
<PB N="267" REF="269">
diameter extending to about one hundred and
thirteen feet, and the &s;horte&s;t to eighty-eight;
but I will not an&s;wer for the exactne&s;s of the
mea&s;urement. In the center of it, there was
a &s;quare &s;tone, with an iron ring, to which
I &s;uppo&s;e the wild bea&s;ts were tied, to pre|vent
their &s;pringing upon the &s;pectators. Some
of the &s;eats remain, with two oppo&s;ite en|trances,
con&s;i&s;ting each of one large gate,
and two lateral &s;maller doors, arched: there
is al&s;o a con&s;iderable portion of the external
wall; but no columns, or other ornaments
of architecture. Hard by, in the garden of
the count de Gubernatis, I &s;aw the remains
of a bath, fronting the portal of the temple,
which I have de&s;cribed in a former letter;
and here were &s;ome &s;hafts of marble pillars,
particularly a capital of the Corinthian order,
beautifully cut, of white alaba&s;ter. Here the
count found a large quantity of fine marble,
which he has converted to various u&s;es; and
&s;ome mutilated &s;tatues, bronze as well as
marble. The pea&s;ant &s;hewed me &s;ome bra&s;s
and &s;ilver medals, which he has picked up at
different times in labouring the ground; to|gether
with &s;everal oblong beads of coloured
<PB N="268" REF="270">
gla&s;s, which were u&s;ed as ear-rings by the
Roman ladies; and a &s;mall &s;eal of agate,
very much defaced. Two of the medals were
of Maximian and Gallienus; the re&s;t were
&s;o con&s;umed, that I could not read the le|gend.
You know, that on public occa&s;ions,
&s;uch as games, and certain &s;acrifices, hand|fuls
of medals were thrown among the peo|ple;
a practice, which accounts for the great
number which have been already found in
this di&s;trict. I &s;aw &s;ome &s;ubterranean pa&s;&s;a|ges,
which &s;eemed to have been common-&s;ewers;
and a great number of old walls &s;till
&s;tanding along the brink of a precipice,
which overhangs the Paglion. The pea&s;ants
tell me, that they never dig above a yard in
depth, without finding vaults or cavities.
All the vineyards and garden-grounds, for a
con&s;iderable extent, are vaulted underneath;
and all the ground that produces their grapes,
fruit, and garden-&s;tuff, is no more than the
crumbled lime and rubbi&s;h of old Roman
buildings, mixed with manure brought from
Nice. This antient town commanded a mo&s;t
noble pro&s;pect of the &s;ea; but is altogether
inacce&s;&s;ible by any kind of wheel carriage.
<PB N="269" REF="271">
If you make &s;hift to climb to it on hor&s;eback,
you cannot de&s;cend to the plain again, with|out
running the ri&s;k of breaking your neck.</P>
<P>About &s;even or eight miles on the other
&s;ide of Nice, are the remains of another
Roman monument, which has greatly &s;uf|fered
from the barbarity of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive ages.
It was a trophy erected by the &s;enate of
Rome, in honour of Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, when
he had totally &s;ubdued all the ferocious na|tions
of the&s;e Maritime Alps; &s;uch as the
Trumpilini Camuni, Vennonetes, I&s;narci,
Breuni, &amp;c. It &s;tands upon the top of a
mountain which overlooks the town of Mo|naco,
and now exhibits the appearance of an
old ruined tower. There is a de&s;cription of
what it was, in an Italian manu&s;cript, by
which it appears to have been a beautiful
edifice of two &s;tories, adorned with columns
and trophies in alto relievo, with a &s;tatue of
Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar on the top. On one of the
&s;ides was an in&s;cription, &s;ome words of which
are &s;till legible, upon the fragment of a mar|ble
found clo&s;e to the old building: but the
whole is pre&s;erved in Pliny, who gives it in
the&s;e words. lib. iii. cap. 20.</P>

of Turbia, with the mountains of which it
forms a bay, where there is a great and cu|rious

king of Sardinia. Upon this point there is
a watch-tower &s;till kept in repair, to give
notice to the people in the neighbourhood, in
ca&s;e any Barbary cor&s;airs &s;hould appear on
the coa&s;t. The catacombs were in all pro|bability
dug, in former times, as places of

<HEAD>LETTER XVII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>July 2, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>NICE was originally a colony from
Mar&s;eilles. You know the Phocians
(if we may believe Ju&s;tin and Polybius) &s;et|tled
in Gaul, and built Mar&s;eilles, during
the reign of Tarquinius Pri&s;cus at Rome.
This city flouri&s;hed to &s;uch a degree, that
long before the Romans were in a condition
to extend their dominion, it &s;ent forth colo|nies,
and e&s;tabli&s;hed them along the coa&s;t of
Liguria. Of the&s;e, Nice, or Nicaea, was one
of the mo&s;t remarkable; &s;o called, in all
probability, from the Greek word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, &s;ig|nifying
<HI>Victoria,</HI> in con&s;equence of &s;ome im|portant
victory obtained over the Salij and
Ligures, who were the antient inhabitants of
this country. Nice, with its mother city,
being in the &s;equel &s;ubdued by the Romans,
fell afterwards &s;ucce&s;&s;ively under the domi|nion
of the Goths, B$rgundians, and Fr$nks
<PB N="275" REF="277">
the kings of Arles, and the kings of Naples, as
counts of Provence. In the year one thou|&s;and
three hundred and eighty-eight, the
city and county of Nice being but ill pro|tected
by the family of Durazzo, voluntarily
&s;urrendered them&s;elves to Amadaeus, &s;ur|named
the Red, duke of Savoy; and &s;ince
that period, they have continued as part of
that potentate's dominions, except at &s;uch
times as they have been over-run and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
by the power of France, which hath
always been a trouble&s;ome neighbour to this
country. The ca&s;tle was begun by the Arra|gonian
counts of Provence, and afterwards
enlarged by &s;everal &s;ucce&s;&s;ive dukes of Savoy,
&s;o as to be deemed impregnable, until the
modern method of be&s;ieging began to take
place. A fruitle&s;s attempt was made upon
it in the year one thou&s;and five hundred and
forty-three, by the French and Turks in
conjunction: but it was reduced &s;everal times
after that period, and is now in ruins. The
celebrated engineer Vauban, being command|ed
by Louis XIV. to give in a plan for forti|fying
Nice, propo&s;ed, that the river Paglion
&s;hould be turned into a new channel, &s;o as
<PB N="276" REF="278">
to &s;urround the town to the north, and fall
into the harbour; that where the Paglion
now runs to the we&s;tward of the city walls,
there &s;hould be a deep ditch to be filled with
&s;ea-water; and that a fortre&s;s &s;hould be built
to the we&s;tward of this fo&s;&s;e. The&s;e particu|lars
might be executed at no very great ex|pence;
but, I apprehend, they would be in|effectual,
as the town is commanded by eve|ry
hill in the neighbourhood; and the exha|lations
from &s;tagnating &s;ea-water would in|fallibly
render the air unwhole&s;ome. Not|with&s;tanding
the undoubted antiquity of
Nice, very few monuments of that antiquity
now remain. The inhabitants &s;ay, they
were either de&s;troyed by the Saracens in their
&s;ucce&s;&s;ive de&s;cents upon the coa&s;t, by the bar|barous
nations in their repeated incur&s;ions,
or u&s;ed in fortifying the ca&s;tle, as well as in
building other edifices. The city of Ceme|nelion,
however, was &s;ubject to the &s;ame di&s;|a&s;ters,
and even entirely ruined; neverthe|le&s;s,
we &s;till find remains of its antient &s;plen|dor.
There have been likewi&s;e a few &s;tones
found at Nice, with antient in&s;criptions; but
there is nothing of this kind &s;tanding, un|le&s;s
<PB N="277" REF="279">
we give the name of antiquity to a mar|ble
cro&s;s on the road to Provence, about half
a mile from the city. It &s;tands upon a
pretty high pede&s;tal with &s;teps, under a pretty
&s;tone cupola or dome, &s;upported by four Ionic
pillars, on the &s;pot where Charles V. empe|ror
of Germany, Francis I. of France, and
pope Paul II. agreed to have a conference,
in order to determine all their di&s;putes. The
emperor came higher by &s;ea, with a power|ful
fleet, and the French king by land, at
the head of a numerous army. All the en|deavours
of his holine&s;s, however, could not
effect a peace; but they agreed to a truce
of ten years. Mezerai affirms, that the&s;e
two great princes never &s;aw one another on
this occa&s;ion; and that this &s;hyne&s;s was ow|ing
to the management of the pope, who&s;e
private de&s;igns might have been fru&s;trated,
had they come to a per&s;onal interview. In
the front of the colonade, there is a &s;mall
&s;tone, with an in&s;cription in Latin, which
is &s;o high, and &s;o much defaced, that I can|not
read it.</P>
<P>In the &s;ixteenth century there was a col|lege
erected at Nice, by Emanuel Philibert,
<PB N="278" REF="280">
duke of Savoy, for granting degrees to &s;tu|dents
of law; and in the year one thou&s;and
&s;ix hundred and fourteen, Charles Emanuel
I. in&s;tituted the &s;enate of Nice; con&s;i&s;ting
of a pre&s;ident, and a certain number of &s;e|nators,
who are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their pur|ple
robes, and other en&s;igns of authority.
They admini&s;ter ju&s;tice, having the power of
life and death, not only through the whole
county of Nice, but cau&s;es are evoked from
Oneglia, and &s;ome other places, to their tri|bunal,
which is the <HI>dernier re&s;ort,</HI> from
whence there is no appeal. The command|ant,
however, by virtue of his military power
and unre&s;tricted authority, takes upon him
to puni&s;h individuals by impri&s;onment, cor|poral
pains, and bani&s;hment, without con&s;ult|ing
the &s;enate, or indeed, ob&s;erving any
form of trial. The only redre&s;s again&s;t any
unju&s;t exerci&s;e of this ab&s;olute power, is by
complaint to the king; and you know, what
chance a poor man has for being redre&s;&s;ed in
this manner.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to religion, I may &s;afely &s;ay,
that here &s;uper&s;tition reigns under the darke&s;t
&s;hades of ignorance and prejudice. I think
<PB N="279" REF="281">
there are ten convents and three nunneries
within and without the walls of Nice; and
among them all, I never could hear of one
man who had made any tolerable advances
in any kind of human learning. All eccle|&s;ia&s;tics
are exempted from any exertion of
civil power, being under the immediate pro|tection
and authority of the bi&s;hop, or his
vicar. The bi&s;hop of Nice is &s;uffragan of
the archbi&s;hop of Ambrun in France; and
the revenues of the &s;ee amount to between
five and &s;ix hundred pounds &s;terling. We
have likewi&s;e an office of the inqui&s;ition,
though I do not hear that it pre&s;umes to
execute any acts of juri&s;diction, without the
king's &s;pecial permi&s;&s;ion. All the churches
are &s;anctuaries for all kinds of criminals, ex|cept
tho&s;e guilty of high trea&s;on; and the
prie&s;ts are extremely jealous of their privi|leges
in this particular. They receive, with
open arms, murderers, robbers, &s;mugglers,
fraudulent bankrupts, and felons of every
denomination; and never give them up, until
after having &s;tipulated for their lives and li|berty.
I need not enlarge upon the perni|cious
con&s;equences of this infamous prero|gative,
<PB N="280" REF="282">
calculated to rai&s;e and extend the
power and influence of the Roman church,
on the ruins of morality and good order. I
&s;aw a fellow, who had three days before mur|dered
his wife in the la&s;t month of preg|nancy,
taking the air with great compo&s;ure
and &s;erenity, on the &s;teps of a church in
Florence; and nothing is more common,
than to &s;ee the mo&s;t execrable villains divert|ing
them&s;elves in the cloy&s;ters of &s;ome con|vents
at Rome.</P>
<P>Nice abounds with noble&s;&s;e, marqui&s;&s;es,
counts, and barons. Of the&s;e, three or four
families are really re&s;pectable: the re&s;t are
<HI>novi homines,</HI> &s;prung from Bourgeois, who
have &s;aved a little money by their different
occupations, and rai&s;ed them&s;elves to the
rank of noble&s;&s;e by purcha&s;e. One is de|&s;$ended
from an avocat; another from an
apothecary; a third from a retailer of wine,
a fourth from a dealer in anchovies; and I
am told, there is actually a count at Ville|franche,
who&s;e father &s;old macaroni in the
&s;treets. A man in this country may buy a
marqui&s;ate, or a county, for the value of
three or four hundred pounds &s;terling, and
<PB N="281" REF="283">
the title follows the fief: but he may pur|cha&s;e
<HI>lettres de noble&s;&s;e</HI> for about thirty or forty
guineas. In Savoy, there are &s;ix hundred fa|milies
of noble&s;&s;e; the greater part of which
have not above one hundred crowns a year to
maintain their dignity. In the mountains of
Piedmont, and even in this county of Nice,
there are &s;ome repre&s;entatives of very antient
and noble families, reduced to the condition
of common pea&s;ants; but they &s;till retain the
antient pride of their hou&s;es, and boa&s;t of
the noble blood that runs in their veins. A
gentleman told me, that in travelling through
the mountains, he was obliged to pa&s;s a
night in the cottage of one of the&s;e ru&s;ticated
nobles, who called to his &s;on in the evening,
&startq;<HI>Chevalier, as tu donn&eacute; a manger aux cochons.</HI>&endq;
This, however, is not the ca&s;e with the no|ble&s;&s;e
of Nice. Two or three of them have
about four or five hundred a year: the re&s;t,
in general, may have about one hundred
pi&s;toles, ari&s;ing from the &s;ilk, oil, wine,
and oranges, produced in their &s;mall planta|tions,
where they have al&s;o country hou&s;es.
Some few of the&s;e are well built, commodi|ous,
and agreeably &s;ituated; but, for the
<PB N="282" REF="284">
mo&s;t part, they are mi&s;erable enough. Our
noble&s;&s;e, notwith&s;tanding their origin, and
the cheap rate at which their titles have been
obtained, are neverthele&s;s extremely tenacious
of their privileges, very delicate in maintain|ing
the <HI>etiquette,</HI> and keep at a very &s;tately
di&s;tance from the Bourgeoi&s;ie. How they
live in their families, I do not choo&s;e to en|quire;
but, in public, Madame appears in
her robe of gold, or &s;ilver &s;tuff, with her
powder and fri&s;ure, her per&s;umes, her paint
and her patches; while Mon&s;ieur Le Comte
&s;truts about in his lace and embroidery.
Rouge and fard are more peculiarly nece&s;&s;ary
in this country, where the complexion and
&s;kin are naturally &s;warthy and yellow. I
have likewi&s;e ob&s;erved, that mo&s;t of the fe|males
are pot-bellied; a circum&s;tance ow|ing,
I believe, to the great quantity of ve|getable
tra&s;h which they eat. All the hor&s;es,
mules, a&s;&s;es, and cattle, which feed upon
gra&s;s, have the &s;ame di&s;ten&s;ion. This kind
of food produces &s;uch acid juices in the &s;to|mach,
as excite a perpetual &s;en&s;e of hunger.
I have been often amazed at the voracious
appetites of the&s;e people. You mu&s;t not
<PB N="283" REF="285">
expect that I &s;hould de&s;cribe the tables and
the ho&s;pitality of our Ni&s;&s;ard gentry. Our
con&s;ul, who is a very hone&s;t man, told me,
he had lived four and thirty years in the
country, without having once eat or drank
in any of their hou&s;es.</P>
<P>The noble&s;&s;e of Nice cannot leave the
country without expre&s;s leave from the king;
and this leave, when obtained, is for a li|mited
time, which they dare not exceed, on
pain of incurring his maje&s;ty's di&s;plea&s;ure.
They mu&s;t, therefore, endeavour to find
amu&s;ements at home; and this, I appre|hend,
would be no ea&s;y ta&s;k for people of
an active &s;pirit or re&s;tle&s;s di&s;po&s;ition. True
it is, the religion of the country &s;upplies a
never-failing fund of pa&s;time to tho&s;e who
have any reli&s;h for devotion; and this is
here a prevailing ta&s;te. We have had tran|&s;ient
vi&s;its of a puppet-&s;hew, &s;trolling mu&s;i|cians,
and rope-dancers; but they did not
like their quarters, and decamped without
beat of drum. In the &s;ummer, about eight
or nine at night, part of the noble&s;&s;e may be
&s;een a&s;&s;embled in a place called the Parc;
which is, indeed, a &s;ort of a &s;treet formed
<PB N="284" REF="286">
by a row of very paltry hou&s;es on one &s;ide,
and on the other, by part of the town-wall,
which &s;creens it from a pro&s;pect of the &s;ea,
the only object that could render it agreeable.
Here you may perceive the noble&s;&s;e &s;tretched
in pairs upon logs of wood, like &s;o many
feals upon the rocks by moon-light, each
dame with her <HI>cici&s;beo:</HI> for, you mu&s;t un|der&s;tand,
this Italian fa&s;hion prevails at
Nice among all ranks of people; and there
is not &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion as jealou&s;y known. The
hu&s;band and the <HI>cici&s;beo</HI> live together as
&s;worn brothers; and the wife and the mi&s;|tre&s;s
embrace each other with marks of the
warme&s;t affection. I do not choo&s;e to enter
into particulars. I cannot open the &s;canda|lous
chronicle of Nice, without hazard of
contamination. With re&s;pect to delicacy and
decorum, you may peru&s;e dean Swift's de|&s;cription
of the Yahoos, and then you will
have &s;ome idea of the <HI>&s;porcherie,</HI> that di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
the gallantry of Nice. But the Parc
is not the only place of public re&s;ort for our
noble&s;&s;e in a &s;ummer's evening. Ju&s;t without
one of our gates, you will find them &s;eated
in ditches on the highway &s;ide, &s;erenaded
<PB N="285" REF="287">
with the croaking of frogs, and the bells and
braying of mules and a&s;&s;es continually pa&s;&s;ing
in a perpetual cloud of du&s;t. Be&s;ides the&s;e
amu&s;ements, there is a public <HI>conver&s;azione</HI>
every evening at the commandant's hou&s;e
called the Government, where tho&s;e noble
per&s;onages play at cards for farthings. In
carnival time, there is al&s;o, at this &s;ame go|vernment,
a ball twice or thrice a week, car|ried
on by &s;ub&s;cription. At this a&s;&s;embly
every per&s;on, without di&s;tinction, is per|mitted
to dance in ma&s;querade: but, after
dancing, they are obliged to unma&s;k, and if
Bourgeois, to retire. No individual can give
a ball, without obtaining a permi&s;&s;ion and
guard of the commandant; and then his
hou&s;e is open to all ma&s;ques, without di|&s;tinction,
who are provided with tickets,
which tickets are &s;old by the commandant's
&s;ecretary, at five &s;ols a-piece, and delivered
to the guard at the door. If I have a mind
to entertain my particular friends, I cannot
have more than a couple of violins; and, in
that ca&s;e, it is called a <HI>conver&s;azione.</HI></P>
<P>Though the king of Sardinia takes all op|portunities
to di&s;tingui&s;h the &s;ubjects of
<PB N="286" REF="288">
Great-Britain with particular marks of re|&s;pect,
I have &s;een enough to be convinced,
that our nation is looked upon with an evil
eye by the people of Nice; and this ari&s;es
partly from religious prejudices, and partly
from envy, occa&s;ioned by a ridiculous no|tion
of our &s;uperior wealth. For my own
part, I owe them nothing on the &s;core of
civilities; and therefore, I &s;hall &s;ay nothing

<SALUTE>DEAR DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Wrote in May to Mr. B&mdash;at Geneva,

<P>The journey from Calais to Nice, of four

a &s;ervant on hor&s;eback, travelling po&s;t, may
be performed with ea&s;e, for about one hun|dred

Ju&s;t without one of the gates, there are two

five loui'dores per month. As for the coun|try
hou&s;es in this neighbourhood, they are
damp in winter, and generally without chim|nies;
and in &s;ummer they are rendered unin|habitable
by the heat and the vermin. If
you hire a tenement in Nice, you mu&s;t take
it for a year certain; and this will co&s;t you
about twenty pounds &s;terling. For this price,
I have a ground floor paved with brick,
con&s;i&s;ting of a kitchen, two large halls, a
couple of good rooms with chimnies, three
large clo&s;ets that &s;erve for bed-chambers,

three apartments for &s;ervants lumber or
&s;tores, to which we a&s;cend by narrow wooden
&s;tairs. I have likewi&s;e two &s;mall gardens,
well &s;tocked with oranges, lemons, peaches,
figs, grapes, corinths, &s;allad, and pot-herbs.
It is &s;upplied with a draw-well of good wa|ter,
and there is another in the ve&s;tibule of
the hou&s;e, which is cool, large, and magni|ficent.
You may hire furniture for &s;uch a
tenement, for about two guineas a month:
but I cho&s;e rather to buy what was nece&s;&s;ary;
<PB N="289" REF="291">
and this co&s;t me about &s;ixty pounds. I &s;up|po&s;e
it will fetch me about half the money
when I leave the place. It is very difficult
to find a tolerable cook at Nice. A common
maid, who &s;erves the people of the country,
for three or four livres a month, will not
live with an Engli&s;h family under eight or
ten. They are all &s;lovenly, &s;lothful, and
uncon&s;cionable cheats. The markets at Nice
are tolerably well &s;upplied. Their beef,
which comes from Piedmont, is pretty good,
and we have it all the year. In the winter,
we have likewi&s;e excellent pork, and delicate
lamb; but the mutton is indifferent. Pied|mont,
al&s;o, affords us delicious capons, fed
with maiz; and this country produces excel|lent
turkeys, but very few gee&s;e. Chickens
and pullets are extremely meagre. I have
tried to fatten them, without &s;ucce&s;s. In
&s;ummer they are &s;ubject to the pip, and die
in great numbers. Autumn and winter are
the &s;ea&s;ons for game; hares, partridges,
quails, wild-pigeons, woodcocks, &s;nipes,
thru&s;hes, beccaficas, and ortolans. Wild-boar
is &s;ometimes found in the mountains:
<PB N="290" REF="292">
it has a delicious ta&s;te, not unlike that of
the wild-hog in Jamaica; and would make
an excellent barbecue, about the beginning
of winter, when it is in good ca&s;e: but,
when meagre, the head only is pre&s;ented at
tables. Phea&s;ants are very &s;carce. As for
the heath-game, I never &s;aw but one cock,
which my &s;ervant bought in the market, and
brought home; but the commandant's cook
came into my kitchen, and carried it off, af|ter
it was half plucked, &s;aying, his ma&s;ter
had company to dinner. The hares are large,
plump, and juicy. The partridges are gene|rally
of the red &s;ort; large as pullets, and of
a good flavour: there are al&s;o &s;ome grey par|tridges
in the mountains; and another &s;ort
of a white colour, that weigh four or five
pounds each. Beccaficas are &s;maller than
&s;parrows, but very fat, and they are generally
eaten half raw. The be&s;t way of dre&s;&s;ing
them, is to &s;tuff them into a roll, &s;cooped
of it's crum; to ba&s;te them well with butter,
and roa&s;t them, until they are brown and
cri&s;p. The ortolans are kept in cages, and
crammed, until they die of fat, then eaten
<PB N="291" REF="293">
as dainties. The thru&s;h is pre&s;ented with
the trail, becau&s;e the bird feeds on olives.
They may as well eat the trail of a &s;heep,
becau&s;e it feeds on the aromatic herbs of the
mountain. In the &s;ummer, we have beef,
veal, and mutton, chicken, and ducks;
which la&s;t are very fat, and very flabby. All
the meat is tough in this &s;ea&s;on, becau&s;e the
exce&s;&s;ive heat, and great number of flies, will
not admit of its being kept any time after it
is killed. Butter and milk, though not very
delicate, we have all the year. Our tea and
fine &s;ugar come from Mar&s;eilles, at a very
rea&s;onable price.</P>
<P>Nice is not without variety of fi&s;h; though
they are not counted &s;o good in their kinds
as tho&s;e of the ocean. Soals, and flat-fi&s;h
in general, are &s;carce. Here are &s;ome mul|lets,
both grey and red. We &s;ometimes &s;ee
the dory, which is called <HI>St. Pietro;</HI> with
rock-fi&s;h, bonita, and mackarel. The gur|nard
appears pretty often; and there is
plenty of a king of large whiting, which eats
pretty well; but has not the delicacy of that
which is caught on our coa&s;t. One of the
be&s;t fi&s;h of this country, is called <HI>Le Loup,</HI>
<PB N="292" REF="294">
about two or three pounds in weight; white,
firm, and well-flavoured. Another, no-way
inferior to it, is the <HI>Mou&s;tel,</HI> about the &s;ame
&s;ize; of a dark-grey colour, and &s;hort, blunt
&s;nout; growing thinner and flatter from the
&s;houlders downwards, &s;o as to re&s;emble a
&s;oal at the tail. This cannot be the <HI>mu&s;tela</HI>
of the antients, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the
&s;ea lamprey. Here too are found the <HI>vyvre,</HI>
or, as we call it, weaver; remarkable for its
long, &s;harp &s;pines, &s;o dangerous to the fin|gers
of the fi&s;hermen. We have abundance
of the <HI>&s;aepie,</HI> or cuttle-fi&s;h, of which the
people in this country make a delicate ragout;
as al&s;o of the <HI>polype de mer,</HI> which is an ugly
animal, with long feelers, like tails, which
they often wind about the legs of the fi&s;her|men.
They are &s;tewed with onions, and eat
&s;omething like cow-heel. The market &s;ome|times
affords the <HI>ecrivi&s;&s;e de mer,</HI> which is a
lob&s;ter without claws, of a &s;weeti&s;h ta&s;te;
and there are a few rock oy&s;ters, very &s;mall
and very rank. Sometimes the fi&s;hermen find
under water, pieces of a very hard cement,
like plai&s;ter of Paris, which contain a kind
of mu&s;cle, called <HI>la datte,</HI> from its re&s;em|blance
<PB N="293" REF="295">
to a date. The&s;e petrefactions are
commonly of a triangular form, and may
weigh about twelve or fifteen pounds each;
and one of them may contain a dozen of
the&s;e mu&s;cles, which have nothing extraor|dinary
in the ta&s;te or flavour, though ex|tremely
curious, as found alive and juicy,
in the heart of a rock, almo&s;t as hard as
marble, without any vi&s;ible communication
with the air or water. I take it for granted,
however, that the inclo&s;ing cement is po|rous,
and admits the finer parts of the &s;ur|rounding
fluid. In order to reach the mu&s;|cels,
this cement mu&s;t be broke with large
hammers; and it may be truly &s;aid, the ker|nel
is not worth the trouble of cracking the
&s;hell. Among the fi&s;h of this country, there
is a very ugly animal of the eel &s;pecies,
which might pa&s;s for a &s;erpent: it is of a
du&s;ky, black colour, marked with &s;pots of
yellow, about eighteen inches, or two feet
long. The Italians call it <HI>murena;</HI> but whe|ther
it is the fi&s;h which had the &s;ame name
among the antient Romans, I cannot pre|tend
to determine. The antient murena was
counted a great delicacy, and was kept in
<PB N="294" REF="296">
ponds for extraordinary occa&s;ions. Julius
Cae&s;ar borrowed &s;ix thou&s;and for one enter|tainment:
but I imagined this was the river
lamprey. The murena of this country is in
no e&s;teem, and only eaten by the poor peo|ple.
Craw-fi&s;h and trout are rarely found in
the rivers among the mountains. The &s;word-fi&s;h
is much e&s;teemed in Nice, and called
<HI>$empereur,</HI> about &s;ix or &s;even feet long: but
I have never &s;een it.<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Since I wrote the above letter, I have eaten &s;everal times of this fi&s;h, which is as white as the fine&s;t veal, and extremely delicate. The emperor a&s;&s;ociates with the tunny fi&s;h, and is always taken in their company.</NOTE> They are very &s;carce;
and when taken, are generally concealed,
becau&s;e the head belongs to the commandant,
who has likewi&s;e the privilege of buying the
be&s;t fi&s;h at a very low price. For which
rea&s;on, the choice pieces are concealed by
the fi&s;hermen, and &s;ent privately to Pied|mont
or Genoa. But, the chief fi&s;heries on
this coa&s;t, are of the &s;ardines, anchovies,
and tunny. The&s;e are taken in &s;mall quan|tities
all the year: but &s;pring and &s;ummer
is the &s;ea&s;on when they mo&s;tly abound. In
June and July, a fleet of about fifty fi&s;hing-boats,
<PB N="295" REF="297">
puts to &s;ea every evening about eight
o'clock, and catch anchovies in immen&s;e
quantities. One &s;mall boat &s;ometimes takes
in one night twenty-five rup, amounting to
&s;ix hundred weight; but it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved,
that the pound here, as well as in other
parts of Italy, con&s;i&s;ts but of twelve ounces.
Anchovies, be&s;ides their making a con&s;idera|ble
article in the commerce of Nice, are a
great re&s;ource in all families. The noble&s;&s;e
and bourgeois fup on &s;allad and anchovies,
which are eaten on all their meagre days.
The fi&s;hermen and mariners all along this
coa&s;t have &s;carce any other food but dry
bread, with a few pickled anchovies; and
when the fi&s;h is eaten, they rub their cru&s;ts
with the brine. Nothing can be more deli|cious
than fre&s;h anchovies fried in oil: I
prefer them to the &s;melts of the Thames. I
need not mention, that the &s;ardines and an|chovies
are caught in nets; &s;alted, barrelled,
and exported into all the different kingdoms
and &s;tates of Europe. The &s;ardines, how|ever,
are large&s;t and fatte&s;t in the month of
September. A company of adventurers have
farmed the tunny-fi&s;hery of the king, for
<PB N="296" REF="298">
&s;ix years; a monopoly, for which they pay
about three thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. They
are at a very con&s;iderable expence for nets,
boats, and attendance. Their nets are di&s;|po&s;ed
in a very curious manner acro&s;s the
&s;mall bay of St. Ho&s;pice, in this neighbour|hood,
where the fi&s;h chiefly re&s;ort. They
are never removed, except in the winter,
and when they want repair: but there are
avenues for the fi&s;h to enter, and pa&s;s, from
one inclo&s;ure to another. There is a man
in a boat, who con&s;tantly keeps watch.
When he perceives they are fairly entered,
he has a method for &s;hutting all the pa&s;&s;es,
and confining the fi&s;h to one apartment of
the net, which is lifted up into the boat,
until the pri&s;oners are taken and &s;ecured.
The tunny-fi&s;h generally runs from fifty to
one hundred weight; but &s;ome of them are
much larger. They are immediately gutted,
boiled, and cut in &s;lices. The guts and head
afford oil: the &s;lices are partly dried, to be
eaten occa&s;ionally with oil and vinegar, or
barrelled up in oil, to be exported. It is
counted a delicacy in Italy and Piedmont,
and ta&s;tes not unlike &s;turgeon. The famous
<PB N="297" REF="299">
pickle of the ancients, called garum, was
made of the gills and blood of the tunny,
or thynnus. There is a much more con&s;ide|rable
fi&s;hery of it in Sardinia, where it is
&s;aid to employ four hundred per&s;ons; but
this belongs to the duc de St. Pierre. In the
neighbourhood of Villa Franca, there are
people always employed in fi&s;hing for coral
and &s;ponge, which grow adhering to the
rocks under water. Their methods do not
&s;avour much of ingenuity. For the coral,
they lower down a &s;wab, compo&s;ed of what
is called &s;punyarn on board our &s;hips of war,
hanging in di&s;tinct threads, and &s;unk by
means of a great weight, which &s;triking
again&s;t the coral in its de&s;cent, di&s;engages it
from the rocks; and &s;ome of the pieces be|ing
intangled among the threads of the
&s;wab, are brought up with it above water.
The &s;ponge is got by means of a cro&s;s-&s;tick,
fitted with hooks, which being lowered
down, fa&s;tens upon it, and tears it from the
rocks. In &s;ome parts of the Adriatic and
Archipelago, the&s;e &s;ub&s;tances are gathered
by divers, who can remain five minutes be|low
water. But I will not detain you one
<PB N="298" REF="300">
minute longer; though I mu&s;t ob&s;erve, that
there is plenty of fine &s;amphire growing
along all the&s;e rocks, neglected and un|known.
Adieu.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XIX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>October 10, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>BEFORE I tell you the price of provi|&s;ions
at Nice, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay
&s;omething of the money. The gold coin of
Sardinia con&s;i&s;ts of the doppia di &s;avoia,
value twenty-four livres Piedmonte&s;e, about
the &s;ize of a loui'dore; and the mezzo dop|pia,
or piece of twelve livres. In &s;ilver,
there is the &s;cudo of &s;ix livres, the mezzo
&s;cudo of three; and the quarto, or pezza di
trenta &s;oldi: but all the&s;e are very &s;carce.
We &s;eldom &s;ee any gold and &s;ilver coin, but
the loui'dore, and the &s;ix, and three-livre
pieces of France; a &s;ure &s;ign that the
French &s;uffer by their contraband commerce
<PB N="299" REF="301">
with the Ni&s;&s;ards. The coin chiefly u&s;ed at
market is a piece of copper &s;ilvered, that
pa&s;&s;es for &s;even &s;ols and a half; another of
the &s;ame &s;ort, value two &s;ols and a half.
They have on one &s;ide the impre&s;&s;ion of
the king's head; and on the other, the
arms of Savoy, with a ducal crown, in&s;cribed
with his name and titles. There are of ge|nuine
copper, pieces of one &s;ol, &s;tamped on
one &s;ide with a cro&s;s fleuree; and on the re|ver&s;e,
with the king's cypher and crown,
in&s;cribed as the others: finally, there is ano|ther
&s;mall copper piece, called piccalon, the
&s;ixth part of a &s;ol, with a plain cro&s;s, and
on the rever&s;e, a &s;lip-knot &s;urmounted with
a crown; the legend as above. The im|pre&s;&s;ion
and legend on the gold and &s;ilver
coins, are the &s;ame as tho&s;e on the pieces of
&s;even &s;ols and a half. The livre of Piedmont
con&s;i&s;ts of twenty &s;ols, and is very near of
the &s;ame value as an Engli&s;h &s;hilling: ten
&s;ols, therefore, are equal to &s;ix-pence &s;terling.
Butcher's meat in general &s;ells at Nice for
three &s;ols a pound; and veal is &s;omething
dearer: but then there are but twelve ounces
in the pound, which being allowed for, &s;ix|teen
<PB N="300" REF="302">
ounces, come for &s;omething le&s;s than
twopence halfpenny Engli&s;h. Fi&s;h commonly
&s;ells for four &s;ols the twelve ounces, or five
for the Engli&s;h pound; and the&s;e five are
equivalent to three-pence of our money: but
&s;ometimes we are obliged to pay five, and
even &s;ix &s;ols for the Piedmonte&s;e pound of
fi&s;h. A turkey that would &s;ell for five or &s;ix
&s;hillings at the London market, co&s;ts me but
three at Nice. I can buy a good capon for
thirty &s;ols, or eighteen-pence; and the &s;ame
price I pay for a brace of partridges, or a
good hare. I can have a woodcock for
twenty-four &s;ols; but the pigeons are dearer
than in London. Rabbits are very rare;
and there is &s;carce a goo&s;e to be &s;een in the
whole county of Nice. Wild-ducks and teal
are &s;ometimes to be had in the winter; and
now I am &s;peaking of &s;ea-fowl, it may not
be ami&s;s to tell you what I know of the hal|cyon,
or king's-fi&s;her. It is a bird, though
very rare in this country, about the &s;ize of a
pigeon; the body brown, and the belly
white: by a wonderful in&s;tinct, it makes its
ne&s;t upon the &s;urface of the &s;ea, and lays it's
eggs in the month of November, when the
<PB N="301" REF="303">
Mediterranean is always calm and &s;mooth as
a mill-pond. The people here call them
martinets, becau&s;e they begin to hatch about
Martinma&s;s. Their ne&s;ts are &s;ometimes &s;een
floating near the &s;hore, and generally become
the prize of the boys, who are very alert in
catching them.</P>
<P>You know all &s;ea-birds are allowed by the
church of Rome to be eaten on meagre days,
as a kind of fi&s;h; and the monks e&s;pecially
do not fail to make u&s;e of this permi&s;&s;ion.
Sea turtle, or tortoi&s;es, are often found at
&s;ea by the mariners, in the&s;e latitudes: but
they are not the green &s;ort, &s;o much in re|que&s;t
among the aldermen of London. All
the Mediterranean turtle are of the kind cal|led
loggerhead, which in the We&s;t-Indies are
eaten by none but hungry &s;eamen, negroes,
and the lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people. One of the&s;e,
weighing about two hundred pounds, was
lately brought on &s;hore by the fi&s;hermen of
Nice, who found it floating a&s;leep on the &s;ur|face
of the &s;ea. The whole town was alarm|ed
at &s;ight of &s;uch a mon&s;ter, the nature of
which they could not comprehend. How|ever,
the monks, called <HI>minims,</HI> of St.
<PB N="302" REF="304">
France&s;co di Paolo, guided by a &s;ure in&s;tinct,
marked it as their prey, and &s;urrounded it
accordingly. The friars of other convents,
not quite &s;o hungry, crowding down to the
beach, declared it &s;hould not be eaten;
dropped &s;ome hints about the po&s;&s;ibility of
its being &s;omething praeternatural and diabo|lical,
and even propo&s;ed exorci&s;ms and a&s;per|&s;ions
with holy water. The populace were
divided according to their attachment to this,
or that convent: a mighty clamour aro&s;e;
and the police, in order to remove the cau&s;e
of their contention, ordered the tortoi&s;e to
be re-committed to the waves; a &s;entence
which the Franci&s;cans &s;aw executed, not
without &s;ighs and lamentation. The land-turtle,
or terrapin, is much better known at
Nice, as being a native of this county; yet
the be&s;t are brought from the i&s;land of Sar|dinia.
The &s;oup or <HI>bouillon</HI> of this animal
is always pre&s;cribed here as a great re&s;torative
to con&s;umptive patients. The bread of Nice
is very indifferent, and I am per&s;uaded very
unwhol&s;ome. The flour is generally mu&s;ty,
and not quite free of &s;and. This is either
owing to the particles of the mill-&s;tone rub|bed
<PB N="303" REF="305">
off in grinding, or to what adheres to
the corn it&s;elf, in being thre&s;hed upon the
common ground; for there are no thre&s;hing-floors
in this country. I &s;hall now take no|tice
of the vegetables of Nice. In the win|ter,
we have green pea&s;e, a&s;paragus, arti|choaks,
cauliflower, beans, French beans,
celery, and endive; cabbage, coleworts, ra|di&s;hes,
turnips, carrots, betteraves, &s;orrel,
lettuce, onions, garlic, and chalot. We
have potatoes from the mountains, mu&s;h|rooms,
champignons, and truffles. Piedmont
affords white truffles, counted the mo&s;t deli|cious
in the world: they &s;ell for about three
livres the pound. The fruits of this &s;ea&s;on,
are pickled olives, oranges, lemons, citrons,
citronelles, dried figs, grapes, apples, pears,
almonds, che&s;nuts, walnuts, filberts, med|lars,
pomegranates, and a fruit called aze|rolles,
about the &s;ize of a nutmeg, of an
oblong &s;hape, red colour, and agreeable acid
ta&s;te. I might likewi&s;e add the cherry of
the <HI>laurus cera&s;us,</HI> which is &s;old in the mar|ket;
very beautiful to the eye, but in&s;ipid
to the palate. In &s;ummer we have all tho&s;e
vegetables in perfection. There is al&s;o a kind
<PB N="304" REF="306">
of &s;mall courge, or gourd, of which the
people of the country make a very &s;avoury
ragout, with the help of eggs, chee&s;e, and
fre&s;h anchovies. Another is made of the
badenjean, which the Spaniards call beren|gena:
it is much eaten in Spain and the
Levant, as well as by the Moors in Barbary.
It is about the &s;ize and &s;hape of a hen's egg,
inclo&s;ed in a cup like an acorn; when ripe,
of a faint purple colour. It grows on a
&s;talk about a foot high, with long &s;pines or
prickles. The people here have different
ways of &s;licing and dre&s;&s;ing it, by broiling,
boiling, and &s;tewing, with other ingredients:
but it is at be&s;t an in&s;ipid di&s;h. There are
&s;ome caper-bu&s;hes in this neighbourhood,
which grow wild in holes of garden walls,
and require no &s;ort of cultivation: in one
or two gardens, there are palm-trees; but
the dates never ripen. In my regi&s;ter of the
weather, I have marked the &s;ea&s;ons of the
principal fruits in this country. In May we
have &s;trawberries, which continue in &s;ea&s;on
two or three months. The&s;e are of the wood
kind; very grateful, and of a good flavour;
but the &s;carlets and hautboys are not known
<PB N="305" REF="307">
at Nice. In the beginning of June, and
even &s;ooner, the cherries begin to be ripe.
They are a kind of bleeding hearts; large,
fle&s;hy, and high flavoured, though rather
too lu&s;cious. I have likewi&s;e &s;een a few of
tho&s;e we call Kenti&s;h cherries, which are
much more cool, acid, and agreeable, e&s;pe|cially
in this hot climate. The cherries are
&s;ucceeded by the apricots and peaches, which
are all &s;tandards, and of con&s;equence better
flavoured than what we call wall-fruit. The
trees, as well as almonds, grow and bear
without care and cultivation, and may be
&s;een in the open fields about Nice: but
without proper culture, the fruit degenerates.
The be&s;t peaches I have &s;een at Nice are
the almberges, of a yellow hue, and oblong
&s;hape, about the &s;ize of a &s;mall lemon.
Their con&s;i&s;tence is much more &s;olid than
that of our Engli&s;h peaches, and their ta&s;te
more delicious. Several trees of this kind I
have in my own garden. Here is likewi&s;e
plenty of other &s;orts; but no nectarines.
We have little choice of plumbs. Neither
do I admire the pears or apples of this
country: but the mo&s;t agreeable apples I
<PB N="306" REF="308">
ever ta&s;ted, come from Final, and are called
pomi carli. The greate&s;t fault I find with
mo&s;t fruits in this climate, is, that they are
too &s;weet and lu&s;cious, and want that agree|able
acid which is &s;o cooling and &s;o grate|ful
in a hot country. This, too, is the ca&s;e
with our grapes, of which there is great
plenty and variety, plump and juicy, and
large as plumbs. Nature, however, has not
neglected to provide other agreeable vegetable
juices to cool the human body. During the
whole &s;ummer, we have plenty of mu&s;k me|lons.
I can buy one as large as my head for
the value of an Engli&s;h penny: but one of
the be&s;t and large&s;t, weighing ten or twelve
pounds, I can have for twelve &s;ols, or about
eight-pence &s;terling. From Antibes and
Sardinia, we have another fruit called a
water-melon, which is well known in Ja|maica,
and &s;ome of our other colonies.
Tho&s;e from Antibes are about the &s;ize of an
ordinary bomb-&s;hell: but the Sardinian and
Jamaica water-melons are four times as large.
The &s;kin is green, &s;mooth, and thin. The
in&s;ide is a purple pulp, &s;tudded with broad,
flat, black &s;eeds, and impregnated with a juice
<PB N="307" REF="309">
the mo&s;t cool, delicate, and refre&s;hing, that
can well be conceived. One would imagine
the pulp it&s;elf di&s;&s;olved in the &s;tomach; for
you may eat of it until you are filled up to
the tongue, without feeling the lea&s;t incon|venience.
It is &s;o friendly to the con&s;titu|tion,
that in ardent inflammatory fevers, it
is drank as the be&s;t emul&s;ion. At Genoa,
Florence, and Rome, it is &s;old in the &s;treets,
ready cut in &s;lices; and the porters, &s;weating
under their burthens, buy and eat them as
they pa&s;s. A porter of London quenches his
thir&s;t with a draught of &s;trong beer: a por|ter
of Rome, or Naples, refre&s;hes him&s;elf
with a &s;lice of water-melon, or a gla&s;s of
iced-water. The one co&s;ts three half-pence&punc;
the la&s;t, half a farthing&mdash;which of them is
mo&s;t effectual? I am &s;ure the men are equally
plea&s;ed. It is commonly remarked, that beer
&s;trengthens as well as refre&s;hes. But the
porters of Con&s;tantinople, who never drink
any thing &s;tronger than water, and eat very
little animal food, will lift and carry heavier
burthens than any other porters in the
known world. If we may believe the mo&s;t
re&s;pectable travellers, a Turk will carry a
<PB N="308" REF="310">
load of &s;even hundred weight, which is more
(I believe) than any Engli&s;h porter ever at|tempted
to rai&s;e.</P>
<P>Among the refre&s;hments of the&s;e warm
countries, I ought not to forget mentioning
the &s;orbettes, which are &s;old in coffee-hou&s;es,
and places of public re$ort. They are iced
froth, made with juice of oranges, apricots,
or peaches; very agreeable to the palate, and
&s;o extremely cold, that I was afraid to &s;wal|low
them in this hot country, until I found
from information and experience, that they
may be taken in moderation, without any
bad con&s;equence.</P>
<P>Another con&s;iderable article in hou&s;e-keep|ing
is wine, which we have here good and
rea&s;onable. The wine of Tavelle in Lan|guedoc
is very near as good as Burgundy,
and may be had at Nice, at the rate of &s;ix-pence
a bottle. The &s;weet wine of St. Lau|rent,
counted equal to thast of Frontignan,
co&s;ts about eight or nine-pence a quart:
pretty good Malaga may be had for half the
money. Tho&s;e who make their own wine
choo&s;e the grapes from different vineyards,
and have them picked, pre&s;&s;ed, and fer|mented
<PB N="309" REF="311">
at home. That which is made by
the pea&s;ants, both red and white, is generally
genuine: but the wine-merchants of Nice
brew and balderda&s;h, and even mix it with
pigeons dung and quick-lime. It cannot
be &s;uppo&s;ed, that a &s;tranger and &s;ojourner
&s;hould buy his own grapes, and make his
own provi&s;ion of wine: but he may buy it
by recommendation from the pea&s;ants, for
about eighteen or twenty livres the charge,
con&s;i&s;ting of eleven rup five pounds; in
other words, of two hundred and eighty
pounds of this country, &s;o as to bring it for
&s;omething le&s;s than three-pence a quart. The
Nice wine, when mixed with water, makes
an agreeable beverage. There is an inferior
&s;ort for &s;ervants, drank by the common peo|ple,
which in the cabaret does not co&s;t above
a penny a bottle. The people here are not
&s;o nice as the Engli&s;h, in the management
of their wine. It is kept in flacons, or large
fla&s;ks, without corks, having a little oil at
top. It is not deemed the wor&s;e for having
been opened a day or two before; and they
expo&s;e it to the hot &s;un, and all kinds of
weather, without he&s;itation. Certain it is,
<PB N="310" REF="312">
this treatment has little or no effect upon its
ta&s;te, flavour, and tran&s;parency.</P>
<P>The brandy of Nice is very indifferent;
and the <HI>liqueurs</HI> are &s;o &s;weetened with coar&s;e
&s;ugar, that they &s;carce retain the ta&s;te or
flavour of any other ingredient.</P>
<P>The la&s;t article of dome&s;tic oeconomy
which I &s;hall mention is fuel, or wood for
firing, which I buy for eleven &s;ols (a little
more than &s;ix-pence halfpenny) a quintal,
con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and fifty pound
Nice weight. The be&s;t, which is of oak,
comes from Sardinia. The common &s;ort is
olive, which being cut with the &s;ap in it,
ought to be laid in during the &s;ummer;
otherwi&s;e, it will make a very uncomfortable
fire. In my kitchen and two chambers, I
burned fifteen thou&s;and weight of wood in
four weeks, exclu&s;ive of charcoal for the kit|chen
&s;toves, and of pine-tops for lighting
the fires. The&s;e la&s;t are as large as pine|apples,
which they greatly re&s;emble in &s;hape,
and to which, indeed, they give their name;
and being full of turpentine, make a won|derful
blaze. For the &s;ame purpo&s;e, the peo|ple
of the&s;e countries u&s;e the &s;arments, or
<PB N="311" REF="313">
cuttings of the vines, which they &s;ell made
up in &s;mall fa&s;cines. This great con&s;umption
of wood is owing to the large fires u&s;ed in
roa&s;ting pieces of beef, and joints, in the
Engli&s;h manner. The roa&s;ts of this country
&s;eldom exceed two or three pounds of meat;
and their other plats are made over &s;tove-holes.
But it is now high time to conduct
you from the kitchen, where you have been
too long detained by</P>
<CLOSER>Your humble &s;ervant.
<HI>P. S.</HI> I have mentioned the prices of al|mo&s;t
all the articles in hou&s;e-keeping, as
they are paid by the Engli&s;h: but exclu&s;ive
of butcher's meat, I am certain the natives
do not pay &s;o much by thirty per cent. Their
impo&s;ition on us, is not only a proof of
their own villany and hatred, but a &s;candal
on their government; which ought to inter|fere
in favour of the &s;ubjects of a nation,
to which they are &s;o much bound in point of
policy, as well as gratitude.</CLOSER>

<HEAD>LETTER XX.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>October 22, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>AS I have nothing el&s;e to do, but to &s;a|tisfy
my own curio&s;ity, and that of
my friends, I obey your injunctions with
plea&s;ure; though not without &s;ome appre|hen&s;ion
that my inquiries will afford you
very little entertainment. The place where
I am is of very little importance or con&s;e|quence
as a &s;tate or community; neither
is there any thing curious or intere&s;ting in the
character or oeconomy of its inhabitants.</P>
<P>There are &s;ome few merchants in Nice,
&s;aid to be in good circum&s;tances. I know
one of them, who deals to a con&s;iderable ex|tent,
and goes twice a year to London to at|tend
the &s;ales of the Ea&s;t-India company.
He buys up a very large quantity of muflins,
and other India goods, and freights a &s;hip in
the river to tran&s;port them to Villa Franca.
Some of the&s;e are &s;ent to Swi&s;&s;erland; but,
<PB N="313" REF="315">
I believe, the greater part is &s;muggled into
France, by virtue of counterfeit &s;tamps,
which are here u&s;ed without any ceremony.
Indeed, the chief commerce of this place is
a contraband traffick carried on to the di&s;advan|tage
of France; and I am told, that the far|mers
of the Levant company in that kingdom
find their account in conniving at it. Certain it
is, a great quantity of merchandize is brought
hither every week by mules from Turin and
other parts in Piedmont, and afterwards con|veyed
to the other &s;ide of the Var, either by
land or water. The mules of Piedmont are
exceeding &s;trong and hardy. One of them
will carry a burthen of near &s;ix hundred
weight. They are ea&s;ily nouri&s;hed, and re|quire
no other re&s;pite from their labour, but
the night's repo&s;e. They are the only car|riage
that can be u&s;ed in cro&s;&s;ing the moun|tains,
being very &s;ure-footed: and it is ob|&s;erved,
that in choo&s;ing their &s;teps, they al|ways
march upon the brink of the precipice.
You mu&s;t let them take their own way,
otherwi&s;e you will bein danger of lo&s;ing
your life; for they are ob&s;tinate, even to
de&s;peration. It is very dangerous to meet
<PB N="314" REF="316">
tho&s;e animals on hor&s;eback: they have &s;uch
an aver&s;ion to hor&s;es, that they will attack
them with incredible fury, &s;o as even to tear
them and their riders in pieces; and the be&s;t
method for avoiding this fate, is to clap
&s;purs to your bea&s;t, and &s;eek your &s;afety in
flight. I have been more than once obliged
to fly before them. They always give you
warning, by rai&s;ing a hideous braying as
&s;oon as they perceive the hor&s;e at a di&s;tance.
The mules of Provence are not &s;o mi&s;chie|vous,
becau&s;e they are more u&s;ed to the &s;ight
and &s;ociety of hor&s;es: but tho&s;e of Pied|mont
are by far the large&s;t and the &s;tronge&s;t
I have &s;een.</P>
<P>Some very fea&s;ible &s;chemes for improving
the commerce of Nice have been pre&s;ented
to the mini&s;try of Turin; but hitherto with|out
&s;ucce&s;s. The Engli&s;h import annually
between two and three thou&s;and bales of
raw &s;ilk, the growth of Piedmont; and this
is embarked either at Genoa or Leghorn.
We likewi&s;e take a con&s;iderable quantity of
fruit and oil at Oneglia, St. Remo, and
other places in this neighbourhood. All the&s;e
commodities might be embarked at a &s;maller
<PB N="315" REF="317">
expence at Nice, which is a free port, where
no duties are paid by the exporter. Be&s;ides,
the county of Nice it&s;elf produces a con&s;ide|rable
quantity of hemp, oranges, lemons,
and very good oil and anchovies, with &s;ome
&s;ilk and wine, which la&s;t is better than that of
Languedoc, and far excels the port drank in
England. This wine is of a &s;trong body, a
good flavour, keeps very well, and improves
by &s;ea-carriage. I am told, that &s;ome of the
wine-merchants here tran&s;port French wine
from Languedoc and Provence, and enter it
in England as the produce of Nice or Italy.
If the merchants of Nice would e&s;tabli&s;h
magazines of raw &s;ilk, oil, wine, &amp;c. at
Nice; and their corre&s;pondents at London
&s;end hither ships at &s;tated periods, laden
with India goods, hard-ware, and other
manufactures of England, which would find
a vent in this country, in Piedmont, Savoy,
Swi&s;&s;erland, and Provence, then the com|merce
of this town would flouri&s;h, more
e&s;pecially if the king would lay out the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
expence for rendering the harbour
more commodious and &s;ecure. But this is
not a matter of very great con&s;equence, as
<PB N="316" REF="318">
there is an excellent harbour at Ville Fran|che,
which is not more than a mile and a
half from that of Nice. But the great ob|jection
to the improvement of commerce at
Nice, is the want of money, indu&s;try, and
character. The natives them&s;elves are in ge|neral
&s;uch dirty knaves, that no foreigners
will tru&s;t them in the way of trade. They
have been known to fill their oil-ca&s;ks half
full of water, and their anchovy-barrels with
&s;tinking heads of that fi&s;h, in order to cheat
their corre&s;pondents.</P>
<P>The &s;hopkeepers of this place are generally
poor, greedy, and over-reaching. Many of
them are bankrupts of Mar&s;eilles, Genoa,
and other countries, who have fled from
their creditors to Nice; which, being a free|port,
affords an a&s;ylum to foreign cheats and
&s;harpers of every denomination. Here is like|wi&s;e
a pretty con&s;iderable number of Jews,
who live together in a &s;treet appropriated
for their u&s;e, which is &s;hut up every night.
They act as brokers; but are generally poor,
and deal in frippery, remnants, old cloaths,
and old hou&s;hold furniture. There is ano|ther
branch of traffick engro&s;&s;ed by the
<PB N="317" REF="319">
monks. Some convents have &s;uch a number
of ma&s;&s;es bequeathed to them, that they find
it impo&s;&s;ible to execute the will of the donors.
In this ca&s;e, they agree by the lump with the
friars of poorer convents, who &s;ay the ma&s;&s;es
for le&s;s money than has been allowed by the
defunct, and their employers pocket the dif|ference:
for example; my grandfather be|queaths
a &s;um of money to a certain con|vent,
to have &s;uch a number of ma&s;&s;es &s;aid
for the repo&s;e of his &s;oul, at the price of
ten &s;ols each; and this convent, not having
time to perform them, bargains with the fri|ars
of another to &s;ay them for &s;ix &s;ols a-piece,
&s;o that they gain four &s;ols upon every ma&s;s;
for it matters not to the &s;oul of the decea&s;ed
where they are &s;aid, &s;o they be properly au|thenticated.
A poor gentleman of Nice,
who piques him&s;elf much on the noble blood
that runs in his veins, though he has not a
pair of whole breeches to wear, complained
to me, that his great grandmother had foun|ded
a perpetual ma&s;s for the repo&s;e of her
own &s;oul, at the rate of fifteen &s;ols (nine-pence
Engli&s;h) a day; which indeed was all
that now remained of the family e&s;tate. He
<PB N="318" REF="320">
&s;aid, what made the hard&s;hip the greater on
him, &s;he had been dead above fifty years,
and in all probability her &s;oul had got out
of purgatory long ago; therefore the con|tinuance
of the ma&s;s was an unnece&s;&s;ary ex|pence.
I told him, I thought in &s;uch a ca&s;e,
the defunct &s;hould appear before the civil
magi&s;trate, and make affidavit of her being
at peace, for the advantage of the family.
He mu&s;ed a little, and &s;hrugging up his
&s;houlders, replied, that where the intere&s;t
of the church was at &s;take, he did not be|lieve
a &s;pirit's declaration would be held legal
evidence. In &s;ome parts of France, the cur&eacute;
of the pari&s;h, on All Soul's day, which is
called <HI>le jour des morts,</HI> &s;ays a <HI>libera domine</HI>
for two &s;ols, at every grave in the burying-ground,
for the relea&s;e of the &s;oul who&s;e
body is there interred.</P>
<P>The arti&s;ans of Nice are very lazy, very
needy, very aukward, and void of all inge|nuity.
The price of their labour is very
near as high as at London or Paris. Rather
than work for moderate profit, ari&s;ing from
con&s;tant employment, which would comfort|ably
maintain them and their families, they
<PB N="319" REF="321">
choo&s;e to &s;tarve at home, to lounge about
the ramparts, ba&s;k them&s;elves in the &s;un, or
play at bowls in the &s;treets from morning
'till night.</P>
<P>The lowe&s;t cla&s;s of people con&s;i&s;ts of
fi&s;hermen, day labourers, porters, and pea|&s;ants:
the&s;e la&s;t are di&s;tributed chiefly in the
&s;mall ca&s;&s;ines in the neighbourhood of the
city, and are &s;aid to amount to twelve thou|&s;and.
They are employed in labouring the
ground, and have all the outward &s;igns of
extreme mi&s;ery. They are all diminutive,
meagre, withered, dirty, and half naked;
in their complexions, not barely &s;warthy,
but as black as Moors; and I believe, in my
con&s;cience, many of them are de&s;cendants
of that people. They are very hard favoured;
and their women in general have the coar&s;e&s;t
features I have ever &s;een: it mu&s;t be owned,
however, they have the fine&s;t teeth in the
world. The nouri&s;hment of tho&s;e poor crea|tures
con&s;i&s;ts of the refu&s;e of the garden,
very coar&s;e bread, a kind of meal called
polenta, made of Indian corn, which is
very nouri&s;hing and agreeable, and a little
oil: but even in the&s;e particulars, they &s;eem

<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="319" REF="323">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="320" REF="324">
to be &s;tinted to very &s;canty meals. I have
known a pea&s;ant feed his family with the
&s;kins of boiled beans. Their hogs are much
better fed than their children. 'Tis pity they
have no cows, which would yield milk, but|ter,
and chee&s;e, for the &s;u&s;tenance of their
families. With all this wretchedne&s;s, one of
the&s;e pea&s;ants will not work in your garden
for le&s;s than eighteen &s;ols, about eleven-pence
&s;terling, <HI>per diem;</HI> and then he does not half
the work of an Engli&s;h labourer. If there
is fruit in it, or any thing he can convey,
he will infallibly &s;teal it, if you do not keep
a very watchful eye over him. All the com|mon
people are thieves and beggars; and I
believe this is always the ca&s;e with people
who are extremely indigent and mi&s;erable.
In other re&s;pects, they are &s;eldom guilty of
exce&s;&s;es. They are remarkably re&s;pectful and
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive to their &s;uperiors. The populace
of Nice are very quiet and orderly. They
are little addicted to drunkenne&s;s. I have
never heard of one riot &s;ince I lived among
them; and murder and robbery are alto|gether
unknown. A man may walk alone
over the county of Nice, at midnight, with|out
<PB N="321" REF="325">
danger of in&s;ult. The police is very
well regulated. No man is permitted to
wear a pi&s;tol or dagger, on pain of being
&s;ent to the gallies. I am informed, that
both murder and robbery are very frequent
in &s;ome parts of Piedmont. Even here,
when the pea&s;ants quarrel in their cups,
(which very &s;eldom happens) they draw
their knives, and the one infallibly &s;tabs the
other. To &s;uch extremities, however, they
never proceed, except when there is a wo|man
in the ca&s;e; and mutual jealou&s;y co|operates
with the liquor they have drank,
to inflame their pa&s;&s;ions. In Nice, the com|mon
people retire to their lodgings at eight
o'clock in winter, and nine in &s;ummer.
Every per&s;on found in the &s;treets after the&s;e
hours, is apprehended by the patrole; and,
if he cannot give a good account of him&s;elf,
&s;ent to pri&s;on. At nine in winter, and ten
in &s;ummer, there is a curfew-bell rung,
warning the people to put out their lights&punc;
and go to bed. This is a very nece&s;&s;ary
precaution in towns &s;ubject to conflagrations;
but of &s;mall u&s;e in Nice, where there is very
little combu&s;tible in the hou&s;es.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="326">
The puni&s;hments inflicted upon malefac|tors
and delinquents at Nice are hanging
for capital crimes; &s;lavery on board the gal|lies
for a limited term, or for life, according
to the nature of the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion; flagella|tion,
and the &s;trappado. This la&s;t is per|formed,
by hoi&s;ting up the criminal by his
hands tied behind his back, on a pulley
about two &s;tories high; from whence, the
rope being &s;uddenly &s;lackened, he falls to
within a yard or two of the ground, where
he is &s;topped with a violent &s;hock, ari&s;ing
from the weight of his body, and the velo|city
of his de&s;cent, which generally di&s;locates
his &s;houlders, with incredible pain. This
dreadful execution is &s;ometimes repeated in a
few minutes on the &s;ame delinquent; &s;o that
the very ligaments are tore from his joints,
and his arms are rendered u&s;ele&s;s for life.</P>
<P>The poverty of the people in this country,
as well as in the South of France, may be
conjectured from the appearance of their do|me&s;tic
animals. The draught-hor&s;es, mules,
and a&s;&s;es, of the pea&s;ants, are &s;o meagre,
as to excite compa&s;&s;ion. There is not a dog
to be &s;een in tolerable ca&s;e; and the cats
<PB N="323" REF="327">
are &s;o many emblems of famine, frightfully
thin, and dangerou&s;ly rapacious. I wonder
the dogs and they do not devour young
children. Another proof of that indigence
which reigns among the common people, is
this: you may pa&s;s through the whole
South of France, as well as the county of
Nice, where there is no want of groves,
woods, and plantations, without hearing the
&s;ong of black-bird, thru&s;h, linnet, gold-finch,
or any other bird what&s;oever. All is
&s;ilent and &s;olitary. The poor birds are de|&s;troyed,
or driven for refuge, into other
countries, by the &s;avage per&s;ecution of the
people, who &s;pare no pains to kill, and catch
them for their own &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. Scarce a
&s;parrow, red-brea&s;t, tom-tit, or wren, can
'&s;cape the guns and &s;nares of tho&s;e indefati|gable
fowlers. Even the noble&s;&s;e make par|ties
to go <HI>&agrave; la cha&s;&s;e;</HI> that is, to kill tho&s;e
little birds, which they eat as <HI>gibier.</HI></P>
<P>The great poverty of the people here, is
owing to their religion. Half of their time
is lo&s;t in ob&s;erving the great number of fe&s;ti|vals;
and half of their &s;ub&s;tance is given to
mendicant friars and pari&s;h prie&s;ts. But if
<PB N="324" REF="328">
the church occa&s;ions their indigence, it like|wi&s;e,
in &s;ome mea&s;ure, alleviates the horrors
of it, by amu&s;ing them with &s;hows, pro|ce&s;&s;ions,
and even tho&s;e very fea&s;ts, which
afford a rece&s;s from labour, in a country
where the climate di&s;po&s;es them to idlene&s;s.
If the pea&s;ants in the neighbourhood of any
chapel dedicated to a &s;aint, who&s;e day is to
be celebrated, have a mind to make a <HI>fe&s;tin,</HI>
in other words, a fair, they apply to the
commandant of Nice for a licence, which
co&s;ts them about a French crown. This
being obtained, they a&s;&s;emble after &s;ervice,
men and women, in their be&s;t apparel, and
dance to the mu&s;ick of fiddles, and pipe and
tabor, or rather pipe and drum. There are
huck&s;ters &s;tands, with pedlary ware and
knick-knacks for pre&s;ents; cakes and bread,
<HI>liqueurs</HI> and wine; and thither generally re|&s;ort
all the company of Nice. I have &s;een
our whole noble&s;&s;e at one of the&s;e <HI>fe&s;tins,</HI>
kept on the highway in &s;ummer, mingled
with an immen&s;e crowd of pea&s;ants, mules,
and a&s;&s;es, covered with du&s;t, and &s;weating
at every pore with the exce&s;&s;ive heat of the
weather. I &s;hould be much puzzled to tell
<PB N="325" REF="329">
whence their enjoyment ari&s;es on &s;uch occa|&s;ions;
or to explain their motives for going
thither, unle&s;s they are pre&s;cribed it for pen|nance,
as a $ore-ta&s;te of purgatory.</P>
<P>Now I am &s;peaking of religious in&s;titu|tions,
I cannot help ob&s;erving, that the an|tient
Romans were &s;till more &s;uper&s;titious
than the modern Italians; and that the
number of their religious fea&s;ts, &s;acrifices,
fa&s;ts, and holidays, was even greater than
tho&s;e of the Chri&s;tian church of Rome.
They had their <HI>fe&s;ti</HI> and <HI>profe&s;ti;</HI> their <HI>feriae
&s;tativae,</HI> and <HI>conceptivae,</HI> their fixed and
moveable fea&s;ts; their <HI>e&s;uriales,</HI> or fa&s;ting
days, and their <HI>precidaneae,</HI> or vigils. The
<HI>agonales</HI> were celebrated in January; the <HI>ca$|mentales,</HI>
in January and February; the <HI>lu|percales</HI>
and <HI>matronales,</HI> in March; the <HI>flo|ralia,</HI>
in May; the <HI>&s;aturnalia, robigalia,
venalia, vertumnalia, fornacalia, palilia,</HI> and
<HI>laralia.</HI> They had their <HI>latinae,</HI> their <HI>pa|ganales,</HI>
their <HI>&s;ementinae,</HI> their <HI>compitales,</HI>
and their <HI>imperativae;</HI> &s;uch as the <HI>novemda|lia,</HI>
in&s;tituted by the &s;enate, on account of
a &s;uppo&s;ed &s;hower of &s;tones. Be&s;ides, eve|ry
private family had a number of <HI>feriae,</HI>
<PB N="326" REF="330">
kept either by way of rejoicing for &s;ome bene|fit,
or mourning for &s;ome calamity. Every
time it thundered, the day was kept holy.
Every ninth day was a holiday, thence called
<HI>nundinae qua&s;i novendinae.</HI> There was the
<HI>dies denominalis,</HI> which was the fourth of
the kalends; nones and ides of every month,
over and above the anniver&s;ary of every
great defeat which the republic had &s;u&s;tained,
particularly the <HI>dies allien&s;is,</HI> or fifteenth of
the kalends of December, on which the
Romans were totally defeated by the Gauls
and Veientes; as Lucan &s;ays&mdash;<HI>et damnata
diu Romanis allia fa&s;tis.</HI> The va&s;t variety of
their deities, &s;aid to amount to thirty thou|&s;and,
with their re&s;pective rites of adoration,
could not fail to introduce &s;uch a number of
ceremonies, &s;hews, &s;acrifices, lu&s;trations, and
public proce&s;&s;ions, as mu&s;t have employed
the people almo&s;t con&s;tantly from one end of
the year to the other. This continual di&s;&s;i|pation
mu&s;t have been a great enemy to in|du&s;try;
and the people mu&s;t have been idle
and effeminate. I think it would be no dif|ficult
matter to prove, that there is very little
difference, in point of character, between the
<PB N="327" REF="331">
antient and modern inhabitants of Rome;
and that the great figure which this empire
made of old, was not &s;o much owing to the
intrin&s;ic virtue of its citizens, as to the bar|bari&s;m,
ignorance, and imbecility of the na|tions
they &s;ubdued. In&s;tances of public and
private virtue I find as frequent and as
&s;triking in the hi&s;tory of other nations, as in
the annals of antient Rome; and now that
the kingdoms and &s;tates of Europe are pretty
equally enlightened, and ballanced in the
&s;cale of political power, I am of opinion,
that if the mo&s;t fortunate generals of the
Roman commonwealth were again placed at
the head of the very armies they once com|manded,
in&s;tead of extending their conque&s;ts
over all Europe and A&s;ia, they would hardly
be able to &s;ubdue, and retain under their
dominion, all the petty republics that &s;ub&s;i&s;t
in Italy.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXI.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>November 10, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR DOCTOR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN my enquiries about the revenues of
Nice, I am obliged to tru&s;t to the infor|mation
of the inhabitants, who are much
given to exaggerate. They tell me, the reve|nues
of this town amount to one hundred
thou&s;and livres, or five thou&s;and pounds
&s;terling; of which I would &s;trike off at lea&s;t
one fourth, as an addition of their own va|nity:
perhaps, if we deduct a third, it will
be nearer the truth. For, I cannot find out
any other funds they have, but the butchery
and the bakery, which they farm at &s;o much
a year to the be&s;t bidder; and the <HI>droits
d'entr&eacute;e,</HI> or duties upon provi&s;ion brought in|to
the city; but the&s;e are very &s;mall. The
king is &s;aid to draw from Nice one hundred
thou&s;and livres annually, ari&s;ing from a free-gift,
amounting to &s;even hundred pounds
<PB N="329" REF="333">
&s;terling, in lieu of the taille, from which this
town and country are exempted; an incon&s;i|derable
duty upon wine &s;old in public-hou&s;es;
and the <HI>droits du port.</HI> The&s;e la&s;t con&s;i&s;t of
anchorage, paid by all ve&s;&s;els in proportion
to their tonnage, when they enter the har|bours
of Nice and Villa Franca. Be&s;ides,
all foreign ve&s;&s;els, under a certain &s;tipulated
burthen, that pa&s;s between the i&s;land of
Sardinia and this coa&s;t, are obliged, in going
to the ea&s;tward, to enter and pay a certain
regulated impo&s;ition, on pain of being ta|ken
and made prize. The prince of Monaco
exacts a talliage of the &s;ame kind; and both
he and the king of Sardinia maintain armed
crui&s;ers to a&s;&s;ert this prerogative; from
which, however, the Engli&s;h and French are
exempted by treaty, in con&s;equence of ha|ving
paid a &s;um of money at once. In all
probability, it was originally given as a con|&s;ideration
for maintaining lights on the
&s;hore, for the benefit of navigators, like the
toll paid for pa&s;&s;ing the Sound in the Baltic.
The fanal, or lanthorn, to the ea&s;tward of
Villa Franca, is kept in good repair, and &s;till
lighted in the winter. The toll, however,
<PB N="330" REF="334">
is a very trouble&s;ome tax upon &s;eluccas, and
other &s;mall craft, which are greatly retarded
in their voyages, and often lo&s;e the benefit of
a fair wind, by being obliged to run in &s;hore,
and enter tho&s;e harbours. The tobacco,
which is mo&s;tly from the Levant, the king
manufactures at his own expence, and &s;ells
for his own profit, at a very high price; and
every per&s;on convicted of &s;elling this commo|dity
in &s;ecret, is &s;ent to the gallies for life.
The &s;alt comes chiefly from Sardinia, and is
&s;tored up in the king's magazine; from
whence it is exported to Piedmont, and other
parts of his inland dominions. And here it
may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve, that Sardinia
produces very good hor&s;es, well-&s;haped,
though &s;mall; &s;trong, hardy, full of mettle,
and ea&s;ily fed. The whole county of Nice
is &s;aid to yield the king half a million of
livres, about twenty-five thou&s;and pounds
&s;terling, ari&s;ing from a &s;mall donative made
by every town and village: for the lands pay
no tax, or impo&s;ition, but the tithes to the
church. His revenue then flows from the
<HI>gabelle</HI> on &s;alt and wine, and the&s;e free-gifts;
&s;o that we may &s;trike off one fifth of the &s;um
<PB N="331" REF="335">
at which the whole is e&s;timated; and con|clude,
that the king draws from the county
of Nice, about four hundred thou&s;and livres,
or twenty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. That
his revenues from Nice are not great, appears
from the &s;mallne&s;s of the appointments al|lowed
to his officers. The pre&s;ident has about
three hundred pounds per annum; and the
intendant about two. The pay of the com|mandant
does not exceed three hundred and
fifty pounds: but he has certain privileges
called the <HI>tour du baton,</HI> &s;ome of which a man
of &s;pirit would not in&s;i&s;t upon. He who
commands at pre&s;ent, having no e&s;tate of
his own, enjoys a &s;mall commandery, which
being added to his appointments at Nice,
make the whole amount to about five hun|dred
pounds &s;terling.</P>
<P>If we may believe the politicians of Nice,
the king of Sardinia's whole revenue does
not fall &s;hort of twenty millions of Pied|monte&s;e
livres, being about one million of
our money. It mu&s;t be owned, that there
is no country in Chri&s;tendom le&s;s taxed than
that of Nice; and as the &s;oil produces the
nece&s;&s;aries of life, the inhabitants, with a
<PB N="332" REF="336">
little indu&s;try, might renew the golden age
in this happy climate, among their groves,
woods, and mountains, beautified with foun|tains,
brooks, rivers, torrents, and ca&s;cades.
In the mid&s;t of the&s;e pa&s;toral advantages,
the pea&s;ants are poor and mi&s;erable. They
have no &s;tock to begin the world with.
They have no lea&s;es of the lands they culti|vate;
but entirely depend, from year to year,
on the plea&s;ure of the arbitrary landholder,
who may turn them out at a minute's warn|ing;
and they are oppre&s;&s;ed by the mendi|cant
friars and pari&s;h prie&s;ts, who rob them
of the be&s;t fruits of their labour: after all,
the ground is too &s;canty for the number of
families which are crouded on it.</P>
<P>You de&s;ire to know the &s;tate of the arts
and &s;ciences at Nice; which, indeed, is al|mo&s;t
a total blank. I know not what men of
talents this place may have formerly produ|ced;
but at pre&s;ent, it &s;eems to be con&s;ecrated
to the reign of dulne&s;s and &s;uper&s;tition. It
is very &s;urpri&s;ing, to &s;ee a people e&s;tabli&s;hed
between two enlightened nations, &s;o devoid
of ta&s;te and literature. Here are no tolera|ble
pictures, bu&s;ts, &s;tatues, nor edifices: the
<PB N="333" REF="337">
very ornaments of the churches are wretch|edly
conceived, and wor&s;e executed. They
have no public, nor private libraries, that
afford any thing worth peru&s;ing. There is
not even a book&s;eller in Nice. Though they
value them&s;elves upon their being natives of
Italy, they are unacquainted with mu&s;ic. The
few that play upon in&s;truments, attend only
to the execution. They have no genius nor
ta&s;te, nor any knowledge of harmony and
compo&s;ition. Among the French, a Ni&s;&s;ard
piques him&s;elf on being Proven&ccedil;al; but in
Florence, Milan, or Rome, he claims the
honour of being born a native of Italy.
The people of condition here &s;peak both
languages equally well; or, rather, equally
ill; for they u&s;e a low, uncouth phra&s;eology;
and their pronunciation is extremely vitious.
Their vernacular tongue is what they call
<HI>Patois;</HI> though in &s;o calling it, they do it in|ju&s;tice.
&mdash;<HI>Patois,</HI> from the Latin word <HI>pata|vinitas,</HI>
means no more than a provincial
accent, or dialect. It takes its name from
<HI>Patavium,</HI> or Padua, which was the birth-place
of Livy, who, with all his merit as a
writer, has admitted into his hi&s;tory, &s;ome
<PB N="334" REF="338">
provincial expre&s;&s;ions of his own country.
The <HI>Patois,</HI> or native tongue of Nice, is no
other than the ancient Proven&ccedil;al, from
which the Italian, Spani&s;h, and French lan|guages,
have been formed. This is the lan|guage
that ro&s;e upon the ruins of the Latin
tongue, after the irruptions of the Goths,
Vandals, Huns, and Burgundians, by whom
the Roman empire was de&s;troyed. It was
&s;poke all over Italy, Spain, and the &s;outhern
parts of France, until the thirteenth century,
when the Italians began to poli&s;h it into the
language which they now call their own.
The Spaniards and French, likewi&s;e, im|proved
it into their re&s;pective tongues. From
its great affinity to the Latin, it was called
<HI>Romance,</HI> a name which the Spaniards &s;till
give to their own language. As the fir&s;t le|gends
of knight-errantry were written in Pro|ven&ccedil;al,
all &s;ub&s;equent performances of the
&s;ame kind, have derived from it the name of
romance; and as tho&s;e annals of chivalry
contained extravagant adventures of knights,
giants, and necromancers, every improbable
&s;tory or fiction is to this day called a romance.
Mr. Walpole, in his Catalogue of royal and
<PB N="335" REF="339">
noble Authors, has produced two &s;onnets in
the antient Proven&ccedil;al, written by our king
Richard I. &s;urnamed <HI>Caeur de Lion;</HI> and
Voltaire, in his Hi&s;torical Tracts, has fa|voured
the world with &s;ome &s;pecimens of
the &s;ame language. The <HI>Patois</HI> of Nice,
mu&s;t, without doubt, have undergone chan|ges
and corruptions in the cour&s;e of &s;o ma|ny
ages, e&s;pecially as no pains have been
taken to pre&s;erve its original purity, either
in orthography or pronunciation. It is ne|glected,
as the language of the vulgar; and
&s;carce any-body here knows either its origin
or con&s;titution. I have in vain endeavoured
to procure &s;ome pieces in the antient Pro|ven&ccedil;al,
that I might compare them with the
modern <HI>Patois:</HI> but I can find no per&s;on to
give me the lea&s;t information on the &s;ubject.
The &s;hades of ignorance, &s;loth, and &s;tupi|dity,
are impenetrable. Almo&s;t every word
of the <HI>Patois</HI> may &s;till be found in the Ita|lian,
Spani&s;h, and French languages, with
a &s;mall change in the pronunciation. <HI>Cavallo,</HI>
&s;ignifying a <HI>hor&s;e</HI> in Italian and Spani&s;h, is
called <HI>cavao; mai&s;on,</HI> the French word for a
<HI>hou&s;e</HI> is changed into <HI>maion; agua,</HI> which
<PB N="336" REF="340">
means <HI>water</HI> in Spani&s;h, the Ni&s;&s;ards call <HI>dai|gua.</HI>
To expre&s;s, <HI>what a &s;top is here!</HI> they &s;ay
<HI>acco fa lac aqui,</HI> which is a &s;entence com|po&s;ed
of two Italian words, one French,
and one Spani&s;h. This is nearly the pro|portion
in which the&s;e three languages will
be found mingled in the <HI>Patois</HI> of Nice;
which, with &s;ome variation, extends over all
Provence, Languedoc, and Ga&s;cony. I will
now treat you with two or three &s;tanzas of
a <HI>canzon,</HI> or hymn, in this language, to the
Virgin Mary, which was lately printed at

<HEAD>LETTER XXII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>November 10, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>I Had once thoughts of writing a complete
natural hi&s;tory of this town and county:
but I found my&s;elf altogether unequal to the
ta&s;k. I have neither health, &s;trength, nor
opportunity, to make proper collections of
the mineral, vegetable, and animal produc|tions.
I am not much conver&s;ant with the&s;e
branches of natural philo&s;ophy. I have no
books to direct my inquiries. I can find no
per&s;on capable of giving me the lea&s;t infor|mation
or a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and I am &s;trangely puz|zled
by the barbarous names they give to
many different &s;pecies, the de&s;criptions of
which I have read under other appellations;
and which, as I have never &s;een them be|fore,
I cannot pretend to di&s;tingui&s;h by the
eye. You mu&s;t therefore be contended with
&s;uch imperfect intelligence as my opportuni|ties
can afford.</P>
<P><PB N="339" REF="343">
The u&s;eful arts practi&s;ed at Nice, are the&s;e,
gardening and agriculture, with their con&s;e|quences,
the making of wine, oil, and cor|dage;
the rearing of &s;ilk-worms, with the
&s;ub&s;equent management and manufacture of
that production; and the fi&s;hing, which I
have already de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>Nothing can be more unpromi&s;ing than the
natural &s;oil of this territory, except in a very
few narrow bottoms, where there is a &s;tiff
clay, which when carefully watered, yields
tolerable pa&s;turage. In every other part, the
&s;oil con&s;i&s;ts of a light &s;and mingled with peb|bles,
which &s;erves well enough for the cul|ture
of vines and olives: but the ground
laid out for kitchen herbs, as well as for
other fruit, mu&s;t be manured with great care
and attention. They have no black cattle to
afford &s;uch compo&s;t as our farmers u&s;e in
England. The dung of mules and a&s;&s;es,
which are their only bea&s;ts of burthen, is of
very little value for this purpo&s;e; and the
natural &s;terility of their ground requires
&s;omething highly impregnated with nitre and
volatile &s;alts. They have recour&s;e therefore
to pigeon's dung and ordure, which fully
<PB N="340" REF="344">
an&s;wer their expectations. Every pea&s;ant
opens, at one corner of his wall, a public
hou&s;e of office for the reception of pa&s;&s;en|gers;
and in the town of Nice, every tene|ment
is provided with one of the&s;e receptacles,
the contents of which are carefully pre&s;erved
for &s;ale. The pea&s;ant comes with his a&s;&s;es
and ca&s;ks to carry it off before day, and pays
for it according to its quality, which he exa|mines
and inve&s;tigates, by the ta&s;te and fla|vour.
The jakes of a prote&s;tant family, who
eat <HI>gras</HI> every day, bears a much higher price
than the privy of a good catholic who lives
<HI>maigre</HI> one half of the year. The vaults be|longing
to the convent of Minims are not
worth emptying.</P>
<P>The ground here is not del$ed with &s;pades
as in England, but laboured with a broad,
&s;harp hough, with a &s;hort horizontal handle;
and the climate is &s;o hot and dry in the &s;um|mer,
that the plants mu&s;t be watered every
morning and evening, e&s;pecially where it is
not &s;haded by trees. It is &s;urpri&s;ing to &s;ee
how the productions of the earth are crouded
together. One would imagine they would
rob one another of nouri&s;hment; and more|over
<PB N="341" REF="345">
be &s;tifled for want of air; and doubt|le&s;s
this is the ca&s;e. Olive and other fruit-trees
are planted in rows very clo&s;e to each
other. The&s;e are connected by vines, and
the inter&s;tices, between the rows, are filled
with corn. The gardens that &s;upply the
town with &s;allad and pot-herbs, lye all on
the &s;ide of Provence, by the highway. They
are &s;urrounded with high &s;tone-walls, or
ditches, planted with a kind of cane or large
reed, which an&s;wers many purpo&s;es in this
country. The leaves of it afford &s;u&s;tenance
to the a&s;&s;es, and the canes not only &s;erve as
fences to the inclo&s;ures; but are u&s;ed to prop
the vines and pea&s;e: they are formed into ar|bours,
and wore as walking-&s;taves. All the&s;e
gardens are watered by little rills that come
from the mountains, particularly, by the &s;mall
branches of the two &s;ources which I have de|&s;cribed
in a former letter, as i&s;&s;uing from the
two &s;ides of a mountain, under the names of
<HI>Fontaine de Muraille,</HI> and <HI>Fontaine du Temple.</HI></P>
<P>In the neighbourhood of Nice, they rai&s;e
a con&s;iderable quantity of hemp, the large&s;t
and &s;tronge&s;t I ever &s;aw. Part of this, when
dre&s;&s;ed, is exported to other countries; and
<PB N="342" REF="346">
part is manufactured into cordage. How|ever
profitable it may be to the grower, it is
certainly a great nu&s;ance in the &s;ummer.
When taken out of the pits, where it has
been put to rot, the &s;trench it rai&s;es is quite
in&s;upportable; and mu&s;t undoubtedly be un|whole&s;ome.</P>
<P>There is &s;uch a want of land in this neigh|bourhood,
that terraces are built over one
another with loo&s;e &s;tones, on the faces of
bare rocks, and the&s;e being covered with
earth and manured, are planted with olives,
vines, and corn. The &s;ame &s;hift was prac|ti&s;ed
all over Pale&s;tine, which was rocky and
barren, and much more populous than the
country of Nice.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding the &s;mall extent of this
territory, there are &s;ome plea&s;ant meadows in
the &s;kirts of Nice, that produce excellent
clover; and the corn which is &s;own in open
fields, where it has the full benefit of the
$oil, &s;un, and air, grows to a &s;urprizing
height. I have &s;een rye &s;even or eight feet
high. All vegetables have a wonderful growth
in this climate. Be&s;ides wheat, rye, barley,
and oats, this country produces a good deal
<PB N="343" REF="347">
of Meliga, or Turki&s;h wheat, which is what
we call Indian corn. I have, in a former let|ter,
ob&s;erved that the meal of this grain goes
by the name <HI>polenta,</HI> and makes excellent
ha&s;ty-pudding, being very nouri&s;hing, and
counted an admirable pectoral. The pods
and &s;talks are u&s;ed for fuel; and the leaves
are much preferable to common &s;traw, for
making <HI>pailla&s;&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>The pea&s;e and beans in the garden appear
in the winter like beautiful plantations of
young trees in blo&s;&s;om; and perfume the air.
Myrtle, &s;weet-briar, &s;weet-marjoram, &s;age,
thyme, lavender, ro&s;emary, with many other
aromatic herbs and flowers, which with us
require the mo&s;t careful cultivation, are here
found wild in the mountains.</P>
<P>It is not many years &s;ince the Ni&s;&s;ards
learned the culture of &s;ilk-worms, of their
neighbours the Piedmonteze; and hitherto
the progre&s;s they have made is not very con|&s;iderable:
the whole county of Nice pro|duces
about one hundred and thirty-three
bales of three hundred pounds each, amount|ing
in value to four hundred thou&s;and livres.</P>
<P><PB N="344" REF="348">
In the beginning of April, when the mul|berry-leaves
begin to put forth, the eggs or
grains that produce the &s;ilk-worm, are hatch|ed.
The grains are wa&s;hed in wine, and
tho&s;e that &s;wim on the top, are thrown a|way
as good for nothing. The re&s;t being
depo&s;ited in &s;mall bags of linen, are worn
by women in their bo&s;oms, until the worms
begin to appear: then they are placed in
&s;hallow wooden boxes, covered with a piece
of white paper, cut into little holes, through
which the worms a&s;cend as they are hatched,
to feed on the young mulberry-leaves, of
which there is a layer above the paper.
The&s;e boxes are kept for warmth between two
mattra&s;&s;es, and vi&s;ited every day. Fre&s;h
leaves are laid in, and the worms that feed
are removed &s;ucce&s;&s;ively to the other place pre|pared
for their reception. This is an habi|tation,
con&s;i&s;ting of two or three &s;tories, about
twenty inches from each other, rai&s;ed upon
four wooden po&s;ts. The floors are made of
canes, and &s;trewed with fre&s;h mulberry-leaves:
the corner po&s;ts, and other occa&s;ional props,
for &s;u&s;taining the different floors, are covered
with a coat of loo&s;e heath, which is twi&s;ted
<PB N="345" REF="349">
round the wood. The worms when hatched
are laid upon the floors; and here you may
&s;ee them in all the different &s;tages of moult|ing
or ca&s;ting the &s;lough, a change which
they undergo three times &s;ucce&s;&s;ively before
they begin to work. The &s;ilk-worm is an
animal of &s;uch acute and delicate &s;en&s;ations,
that too much care cannot be taken to keep
its habitation clean, and to refre&s;h it from
time to time with pure air. I have &s;een
them langui&s;h and die in &s;cores, in con&s;e|quence
of an accidental bad &s;mell. The
&s;oiled leaves, and the filth which they nece&s;|&s;arily
produce, &s;hould be carefully &s;hifted
every day; and it would not be ami&s;s to
purify the air &s;ometimes with fumes of vine|gar,
ro&s;e, or orange-flower water. The&s;e
niceties, however, are but little ob&s;erved.
They commonly lie in heaps as thick as
&s;hrimps in a plate, &s;ome feeding on the
leaves, &s;ome new hatched, &s;ome intranced in
the agonies of ca&s;ting their &s;kin, &s;ome lan|gui&s;hing,
and &s;ome actually dead, with a lit|ter
of half eaten faded leaves about them, in
a clo&s;e room, crouded with women and chil|dren,
not at all remarkable for their cleanli|ne&s;s.
<PB N="346" REF="350">
I am a&s;&s;ured by &s;ome per&s;ons of credit,
that if they are touched, or even approached,
by a woman in her catamenia, they infallibly
expire. This, however, mu&s;t be under&s;tood
of tho&s;e females who&s;e &s;kins have naturally a
very rank flavour, which is generally height|ened
at &s;uch periods. The mulberry-leaves
u&s;ed in this country are of the tree which
bears a &s;mall white fruit not larger than a
dama&s;cene. They are planted on purpo&s;e,
and the leaves are &s;old at &s;o much a pound.
By the middle of June all the mulberry-trees
are &s;tripped; but new leaves &s;ucceed, and in
a few weeks, they are cloathed again with
fre&s;h verdure. In about ten days after the
la&s;t moulting, the &s;ilk-worm climbs upon the
props of his hou&s;e, and choo&s;ing a &s;ituation
among the heath, begins to &s;pin in a mo&s;t
curious manner, until he is quite inclo&s;ed,
and the cocon or pod of &s;ilk, about the &s;ize
of a pigeon's egg, which he has produced,
remains &s;u&s;pended by &s;everal filaments. It is
not unu&s;ual to &s;ee double cocons, &s;pun by
two worms included under a common cover.
There mu&s;t be an infinite number of worms
to yield any con&s;iderable quantity of &s;ilk.
<PB N="347" REF="351">
One ounce of eggs or grains produces four
rup, or one hundred Nice pounds of cocons;
and one rup, or twenty-five pounds of cocons,
if they are rich, gives three pounds of raw
&s;ilk; that is, twelve pounds of &s;ilk are got
from one ounce of grains, which ounce of
grains is produced by as many worms as are
inclo&s;ed in one pound, or twelve ounces of
cocons. In pre&s;erving the cocons for breed,
you mu&s;t choo&s;e an equal number of males
and females; and the&s;e are very ea&s;ily di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
by the &s;hape of the cocons; that
which contains the male is &s;harp, and the
other obtu&s;e, at the two ends. In ten or
twelve days after the cocon is fini&s;hed, the
worm makes its way through it, in the form
of a very ugly, unwieldy, aukward butter|fly,
and as the different &s;exes are placed by
one another on paper or linen, they imme|diately
engender. The female lays her eggs,
which are carefully pre&s;erved; but neither
&s;he nor her mate takes any nouri&s;hment, and
in eight or ten days after they quit the cocons,
they generally die. The &s;ilk of the&s;e cocons
cannot be wound, becau&s;e the animals in
piercing through them, have de&s;troyed the
<PB N="348" REF="352">
continuity of the filaments. It is therefore,
fir&s;t boiled, and then picked and carded like
wool, and being afterwards &s;pun, is u&s;ed in
the coar&s;er &s;tuffs of the &s;ilk manufacture.
The other cocons, which yield the be&s;t &s;ilk,
are managed in a different manner. Before
the inclo&s;ed worm has time to penetrate, the
&s;ilk is reeled off with equal care and inge|nuity.
A handful of the cocons are thrown
into a kettle of boiling water, which not only
kills the animal, but di&s;&s;olves the glutinous
&s;ub&s;tance by which the fine filaments of the
&s;ilk cohere or &s;tick together, &s;o that they are
ea&s;ily wound off, without breaking. Six or
&s;even of the&s;e &s;mall filaments being joined to|gether
are pa&s;&s;ed over a kind of twi&s;ting iron,
and fixed to the wheel, which one girl turns,
while another, with her hands in the boiling
water, di&s;entangles the threads, joins them
when they chance to break, and &s;upplies fre&s;h
cocons with admirable dexterity and di&s;patch.
There is a manufacture of this kind ju&s;t with|out
one of the gates of Nice, where forty or
fifty of the&s;e wheels are worked together, and
give employment for &s;ome weeks to double the
number of young women. Tho&s;e who ma|nage
<PB N="349" REF="353">
the pods that float in the boiling water
mu&s;t be very alert, otherwi&s;e they will &s;cald
their fingers. The &s;mell that comes from the
boiling cocons is extremely offen&s;ive. Hard
by the harbour, there is a very curious mill
for twi&s;ting the &s;ilk, which goes by water.
There is in the town of Nice, a well regu|lated
ho&s;pital for poor orphans of both &s;exes,
where above one hundred of them are em|ployed
in dre&s;&s;ing, dying, &s;pinning and weav|ing
the &s;ilk. In the villages of Provence, you
&s;ee the poor women in the &s;treets &s;pinning
raw &s;ilk upon di&s;taves: but here the &s;ame
in&s;trument is only u&s;ed for &s;pinning hemp
and flax; which la&s;t, however, is not of the
growth of Nice.&mdash;But le&s;t I &s;hould &s;pin this
letter to a tedious length, I will now wind
up my bottom, and bid you heartily fare|well.</P>

<HEAD>LETTER XXIII.</HEAD>
<OPENER><DATELINE>Nice, <DATE>December 19, 1764.</DATE></DATELINE>
<SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>IN may la&s;t, I gave you a &s;uccinct account
of the &s;ilk-worm, and the management
of that curious in&s;ect in this country. I &s;hall
now proceed to de&s;cribe the methods of mak|ing
wine and oil.</P>
<P>The vintage begins in September. The
grapes being cho&s;en and carefully picked, are
put into a large vat, where they are pre&s;&s;ed
by a man's naked feet, and the juices drawn
off by a cock below. When no more is pro|cured
by this operation, the brui&s;ed grapes
are put into the pre&s;s, and yield &s;till more
liquor. The juice obtained by this double
pre&s;&s;ure, being put in ca&s;ks, with their bungs
open, begins to ferment and di&s;charge its
impurities at the openings. The wa&s;te occa|&s;ioned
by this di&s;charge, is con&s;tantly &s;up|plied
with fre&s;h wine; &s;o that the ca&s;ks are
always full. The fermentation continues
<PB N="351" REF="355">
for twelve, fifteen, or twenty days, according
to the &s;trength and vigour of the grape. In
about a month, the wine is fit for drinking.
When the grapes are of a bad, meagre kind,
the wine dealers mix the juice with pigeons-dung
or quick-lime, in order to give it a
&s;pirit which nature has denied: but this is a
very mi&s;chievous adulteration.</P>
<P>The proce&s;s for oil-making is equally &s;im|ple.
The be&s;t olives are tho&s;e that grow wild;
but the quantity of them is very incon&s;idera|ble.
Olives begin to ripen and drop in the
beginning of November: but &s;ome remain
on the trees till February, and even till April,
and the&s;e are counted the mo&s;t valuable.
When the olives are gathered, they mu&s;t be
manufactured immediately, before they fade
and grow wrinkled, otherwi&s;e they will pro|duce
bad oil. They are fir&s;t of all ground
into a pa&s;te by a mill-&s;tone &s;et edge-ways in
a circular &s;tone-trough, and turned by water.
This pa&s;te is put into circular ca&s;es made of
gra&s;s woven, having a round hole at top and
bottom; when filled they re&s;emble in &s;hape
our Che&s;hire chee&s;es. A number of the&s;e
placed one upon another, are put in a pre&s;s,
<PB N="352" REF="356">
and being &s;queezed, the oil with all its im|purities,
runs into a receptacle below fixed
in the ground. From hence it is laded into a
wooden vat, half filled with water. The
&s;ordes or dirt falls to the bottom; the oil
&s;wims a-top; and being &s;kimmed off, is bar|re$$ed
up in &s;mall oblong ca&s;ks. What re|mains
in the vat, is thrown into a large &s;tone
ci&s;tern with water, and after being often &s;tirred,
and &s;tanding twelve or fourteen days, yields
a coar&s;er oil u&s;ed for lamps and manufac|tures.
After the&s;e proce&s;&s;es, they extract an
oil &s;till more coar&s;e and fetid from the refu&s;e
of the whole. Sometimes, in order to make
the olives grind the more ea&s;ily into a pa&s;te,
and part with more oil, they are mixed with a
little hot water: but the oil thus procured is
apt to grow rancid. The very fine&s;t, called
virgin oil, is made chiefly of green olives,
and &s;old at a very high price, becau&s;e a great
quantity is required to produce a very little
oil. Even the &s;tuff that is left after all the&s;e
operations, con&s;i&s;ting of the dried pulp, is
&s;old for fuel, and u&s;ed in <HI>bra&s;ieres</HI> for warm|ing
apartments which have no chimney.</P>
<P><PB N="353" REF="357">
I have now &s;pecified all the manufactures
of Nice which are worth mentioning. True
it is, there is &s;ome coar&s;e paper made in this
neighbourhood; there are al&s;o people here
who dre&s;s &s;kins and make leather for the u&s;e
of the inhabitants: but this bu&s;ine&s;s is very
ill performed: the gloves and &s;hoes are gene|rally
rotten as they come from the hands of
the maker. Carpenter's, joiner's, and black|&s;mith's
work is very coar&s;ely and clum&s;ily
done. There are no chairs to be had at
Nice, but crazy things made of a few &s;ticks,
with ru&s;h bottoms, which are &s;old for twelve
livres a dozen. Nothing can be more con|temptible
than the hard-ware made in this
place, &s;uch as knives, &s;ci&s;&s;ars, and candle-&s;nuffers.
All uten&s;ils in bra&s;s and copper are
very ill made and fini&s;hed. The &s;ilver-&s;miths
make nothing but &s;poons, forks, paultry
rings, and cro&s;&s;es for the necks of the wo|men.</P>
<P>The hou&s;es are built of a ragged &s;tone
dug from the mountains, and the inter&s;tices
are filled with rubble; &s;o that the walls would
appear very ugly, if they were not covered
with plai&s;ter, which has a good effect. They
<PB N="354" REF="358">
generally con&s;i&s;t of three &s;tories, and are co|vered
with tiles. The apartments of the
better &s;ort are large and lofty, the floors
paved with brick, the roofs covered with a
thick coat of &s;tucco, and the walls white-wa&s;hed.
People of di&s;tinction hang their
chambers with dama&s;k, &s;triped &s;ilk, painted
cloths, tape&s;try, or printed linnen. All the
doors, as well as the windows, con&s;i&s;t of
folding leaves. As there is no wain&s;cot in
the rooms, which are divided by &s;tone parti|tions
and the floors and cieling are covered
with brick and &s;tucco, fires are of much
le&s;s dreadful con&s;equences here than in our
country. Wain&s;cot would afford harbour
for bugs: be&s;ides, white walls have a better
effect in this hot climate. The beds com|monly
u&s;ed in this place, and all over Italy,
con&s;i&s;t of a <HI>pailla&s;&s;e,</HI> with one or two mat|tra&s;&s;es,
laid upon planks, &s;upported by two
wooden benches. In&s;tead of curtains there
is a <HI>couziniere</HI> or mo&s;quito net, made of a
kind of gauze, that opens and contracts oc|ca&s;ionally,
and inclo&s;es the place where you
lie: per&s;ons of condition, however, have al&s;o
<PB N="355" REF="359">
bed&s;teads and curtains; but the&s;e la&s;t are
never u&s;ed in the &s;ummer.</P>
<P>In the&s;e countries, people of all ranks
dine exactly at noon; an this is the time I
&s;eize in winter, for making my daily tour of
the &s;treets and ramparts, which at all other
hours of the day are crowded with men, wo|men,
children and bea&s;ts of burthen. The
rampart is the common road for carriages of
all kinds. I think there are two private
coaches in Nice, be&s;ides that of the com|mandant:
but there are &s;edan chairs, which
may be had at a rea&s;onable rate. When I
bathed in the &s;ummer, I paid thirty &s;ols,
equal to eighteen-pence, for being carried to
and from the bathing place, which was a
mile from my own hou&s;e. Now I am &s;peak|ing
of bathing, it may not be ami&s;s to in|form
you that though there is a fine open
beach, extending &s;everal miles to the we&s;t|ward
of Nice, tho&s;e who cannot &s;wim ought
to bathe with great precaution, as the &s;ea is
very deep, and the de&s;cent very abrupt from
within a yard or two of the water's edge.
The people here were much &s;urpri&s;ed when I
began to bathe in the beginning of May.
<PB N="356" REF="360">
They thought it very &s;trange, that a man
&s;eemingly con&s;umptive &s;hould plunge into
the &s;ea, e&s;pecially when the weather was &s;o
cold; and &s;ome of the doctors progno&s;ticated
immediate death. But, when it was perceived
that I grew better in con&s;equence of the bath,
&s;ome of the Swi&s;s officers tried the &s;ame ex|periment,
and in a few days, our example
was followed by &s;everal inhabitants of Nice.
There is, however, no convenience for this
operation, from the benefit of which the fair
&s;ex must be intirely excluded, unle&s;s they lay
a&s;ide all regard to decorum; for the &s;hore is
always lined with fi&s;hing-boats, and crouded
with people. If a lady &s;hould be at the ex|pence
of having a tent pitched on the beach
where &s;he might put on and off her bathing-dre&s;s,
&s;he could not pretend to go into the &s;ea
without proper attendants; nor could &s;he
po&s;&s;ibly plunge headlong into the water,
which is the mo&s;t effectual, and lea&s;t dan|gerous
way of bathing. All that &s;he can do
is to have the &s;ea-water brought into her
hou&s;e, and make u&s;e of a bathing-tub, which
may be made according to her own, or phy|&s;ician's
direction.</P>
<P><PB N="357" REF="361">
What further I have to &s;ay of this climate
and country, you &s;hall have in my next;

<SALUTE>DEAR SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE con&s;titution of this climate may
be pretty well a&s;certained, from the
inclo&s;ed regi&s;ter of the weather, which I kept
with all po&s;&s;ible care and attention. From a
peru&s;al of it, you will &s;ee that there is le&s;s
rain and wind at Nice, than in any other
part of the world that I know; and &s;uch is
the &s;erenity of the air, that you &s;ee nothing
above your head for &s;everal months together,
but a charming blue expan&s;e, without cloud
or &s;peck. Whatever clouds may be formed
<PB N="358" REF="362">
by evaporation from the &s;ea, they &s;eldom
or never hover over this &s;mall territory; but,
in all probability, are attracted by the moun|tains
that &s;urround it, and there fall in rain
or &s;now: as for tho&s;e that gather from other
quarters, I &s;uppo&s;e their progre&s;s hitherward
is ob&s;tructed by tho&s;e very Alps which ri&s;e
one over another, to an extent of many
leagues. This air being dry, pure, heavy,
and ela&s;tic, mu&s;t be agreeable to the con&s;ti|tution
of tho&s;e who labour under di&s;orders
ari&s;ing from weak nerves, ob&s;tructed per&s;pi|ration,
relaxed fibres, a vi&s;cidity of lymph,
and a languid circulation. In other re&s;pects,
it encourages the &s;curvy, the atmo&s;phere be|ing
undoubtedly impregnated with &s;ea-&s;alt.
Ever &s;ince my arrival at Nice, I have had a
fcorbutical eruption on my right hand,
which dimini&s;hes and increa&s;es according to
the &s;tate of my health. One day la&s;t &s;um|mer,
when there was a &s;trong breeze from
the &s;ea, the &s;urface of our bodies was co|vered
with a &s;alt brine, very perceptible to
the ta&s;te; my gums, as well as tho&s;e of
another per&s;on in my family, began to &s;well,
<PB N="359" REF="363">
and grow painful, though this had never
happened before; and I was &s;eized with vio|lent
pains in the joints of my knees. I was
then at a country-hou&s;e fronting the &s;ea,
and particularly expo&s;ed to the marine air.
The &s;welling of our gums &s;ub&s;ided as the
wind fell: but what was very remarkable,
the &s;curvy-&s;pot on my hand di&s;appeared, and
did not return for a whole month. It is af|firmed,
that &s;ea-&s;alt will di&s;&s;olve and ren|der
the blood &s;o fluid, that it will exude
through the coats of the ve&s;&s;els. Perhaps
the &s;ea-&s;curvy is a partial di&s;&s;olution of it,
by that mineral ab&s;orbed from the air by the
lymphatics on the &s;urface of the body, and
by tho&s;e of the lungs in re&s;piration. Certain
it is, in the la&s;t &s;tages of the &s;ea-&s;curvy, the
blood often bur&s;ts from the pores; and this
phaenomenon is imputed to a high degree of
putrefaction: &s;ure enough it is attended with
putrefaction. We know that a certain quan|tity
of &s;alt is required to pre&s;erve the animal
juices from growing putrid: but, how a
greater quantity &s;hould produce putrefaction,
I leave to wi&s;er heads to explain. Many peo|ple
<PB N="360" REF="364">
here have &s;corbutical complaints, though
their teeth are not affected. They are &s;ub|ject
to eruptions on the &s;kin, putrid gums,
pains in the bones, la&s;&s;itude, indige&s;tion, and
low &s;pirits; but the reigning di&s;temper is a
<HI>mara&s;mus,</HI> or con&s;umption, which proceeds
gradually, without any pulmonary complaint,
the complexion growing more and more flo|rid,
'till the very la&s;t &s;cene of the tragedy.
This I would impute to the effects of a very
dry, &s;aline atmo&s;phere, upon a thin habit,
in which there is an extraordinary wa&s;te by
per&s;piration. The air is remarkably &s;alt in
this di&s;trict, becau&s;e the mountains that hem
it in, prevent its communication with the cir|cumambient
atmo&s;phere, in which the &s;aline
particles would otherwi&s;e be diffu&s;ed; and
there is no rain, nor dew, to precipitate or
di&s;&s;olve them. Such an air as I have de|&s;cribed,
&s;hould have no bad effect upon a
moi&s;t, phlegmatic con&s;titution, &s;uch as mine;
and yet it mu&s;t be owned, I have been vi&s;i|bly
wa&s;ting &s;ince I came hither, though this
decay I con&s;idered as the progre&s;s of the <HI>tabes</HI>
which began in England. But the air of
Nice has had a &s;till more &s;en&s;ible effect upon
<PB N="361" REF="365">
Mr. Sch&mdash;z, who laboured under nervous
complaints to &s;uch a degree, that life was a
burthen to him. He had al&s;o a fixed pain in
his brea&s;t, for which complaint he had for|merly
tried the air of Naples, where he re&s;i|ded
&s;ome con&s;iderable time, and in a great
mea&s;ure recovered: but, this returning with
weakne&s;s, faintne&s;s, low &s;pirits, and entire
lo&s;s of appetite, he was advi&s;ed to come hi|ther;
and the &s;ucce&s;s of his journey has
greatly exceeded his expectation. Though
the weather has been remarkably bad for this
climate, he has enjoyed perfect health. Since
he arrived at Nice, the pain in his brea&s;t va|ni&s;hed;
he eats heartily, &s;leeps well, is in
high &s;pirits, and &s;o &s;trong, that he is never
off his legs in the day-time. He can walk
to the Var, and back again, before dinner;
and he had climbed to the tops of all the
mountains in this neighbourhood. I never
&s;aw before &s;uch &s;udden and happy effects from
the change of air. I mu&s;t al&s;o acknowledge,
that ever &s;ince my arrival at Nice, I have
breathed more freely than I had done for &s;ome
years, and my &s;pirits have been more alert.
The father of my <HI>oeeonome,</HI> who was a dan|cing-ma&s;ter,
<PB N="362" REF="366">
had been &s;o afflicted with an
a&s;thmatic di&s;order, that he could not live in
France, Spain, or Italy; but found the air
of Nice &s;o agreeable to his lungs, that he
was enabled to exerci&s;e his profe&s;&s;ion for
above twenty years, and died la&s;t &s;pring
turned of &s;eventy. Another advantage I have
reaped from this climate is my being, in a
great mea&s;ure, delivered from a &s;low fever
which u&s;ed to hang about me, and render
life a burthen. Neither am I &s;o apt to catch
cold as I u&s;ed to be in England and France;
and the colds I do catch are not of the &s;ame
continuance and con&s;equence, as tho&s;e to
which I was formerly &s;ubject. The air of
Nice is &s;o dry, that in &s;ummer, and even in
winter, (except in wet weather) you may
pa&s;s the evening, and indeed the whole
night, <HI>&s;ub Dio,</HI> without feeling the lea&s;t
dew or moi&s;ture; and as for fogs, they are
never &s;een in this di&s;trict. In &s;ummer, the
air is cooled by a regular &s;ea$breeze blowing
from the ea&s;t, like that of the We&s;t-Indies.
It begins in the forenoon, and increa&s;es with
the heat of the day. It dies away about &s;ix
or &s;even; and immediately after &s;un-&s;et, is
<PB N="363" REF="367">
&s;ucceeded by an agreeable land-breeze from
the mountains. The &s;ea-breeze from the
ea&s;tward, however, is not &s;o con&s;tant here,
as in the We&s;t-Indies between the tropicks,
becau&s;e the &s;un, which produces it, is not &s;o
powerful. This country lies nearer the re|gion
of variable winds, and is &s;urrounded
by mountains, capes, and &s;traights, which
often influence the con&s;titution and current
of the air. About the winter &s;ol&s;tice, the
people of Nice expect wind and rain, which
generally la&s;ts, with intervals, 'til the begin|ning
of February: but even during this,
their wor&s;t weather, the &s;un breaks out occa|&s;ionally,
and you may take the air either
a-foot or on hor&s;eback every day; for the
moi&s;ture is immediately ab&s;orbed by the
earth, which is naturally dry. They like|wi&s;e
lay their account with being vi&s;ited by
&s;howers of rain and gu&s;ts of wind in April.
A week's rain in the middle of Augu&s;t
makes them happy. It not only refre&s;hes
the parched ground, and plumps up the
grapes and other fruit, but it cools the air
and a&s;&s;uages the heats, which then begin to
grow very trouble&s;ome; but the rainy &s;ea&s;on
<PB N="364" REF="368">
is about the autumnal equinox, or rather
&s;omething later. It continues about twelve
days or a fortnight, and is extremely wel|come
to the natives of this country. T$$$
rainy &s;ea&s;on is often delayed 'till the latter
end of November, and &s;ometimes 'till the
month of December; in which ca&s;e, the re&s;t
of the winter is generally dry. The heavy
rains in this country generally come with a
&s;outh-we&s;t wind, which was the <HI>creberque
procellis Africus</HI> of the antients. It is here
called <HI>Leb$$he,</HI> a corruption of <HI>Lybicus:</HI> it
generally blows high for a day or two, and
rolls the Mediterranean before it in huge
waves, that often enter the town of Nice.
It likewi&s;e drives before it all the clouds
which had been formed above the &s;urface of
the Mediterranean. The&s;e being expended
in rain, fair weather naturally en&s;ues. For
this rea&s;on, the Ni&s;&s;ards ob&s;erve <HI>le lebeche
raccommode le tems.</HI> During the rains of this
&s;ea&s;on, however, the winds have been varia|ble.
From the &s;ixteenth of November, 'till
the fourth of January, we have had two
and twenty days of heavy rain: a very ex|traordinary
vi&s;itation in this country: but
<PB N="365" REF="369">
the &s;ea&s;ons &s;eem to be more irregular than
formerly, all over Europe. In the month of
July, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermo|meter,
ro&s;e to eighty-four at Rome; the
highe&s;t degree at which it was ever known in
that country; and the very next day, the
Sabine mountains were covered with &s;now.
The &s;ame phaenomenon happened on the ele|venth
of Augu&s;t, and the thirtieth of Sep|tember.
The con&s;equence of the&s;e &s;udden
variations of weather, was this: putrid fe|vers
were le&s;s frequent than u&s;ual; but the
&s;udden check of per&s;piration from the cold,
produced colds, inflammatory &s;ore throats,
and the rheumati&s;m. I know in&s;tances of
&s;ome Engli&s;h valetudinarians, who have
pa&s;&s;ed the winter at Aix, on the &s;uppo&s;ition
that there was little or no difference between
that air and the climate of Nice: but this is
a very great mi&s;take, which may be attended
with fatal con&s;equences. Aix is altogether
expo&s;ed to the nort$ and north-we&s;t winds,
which blow as cold in Provence, as ever I
felt them on the mountains of Scotland:
whereas Nice is entirely &s;creened from the&s;e
winds by the Maritime Alps, which form an
<PB N="366" REF="370">
amphitheatre, to the land-&s;ide, around this
little territory: but another inconte&s;tible proof
of the mildne&s;s of this climate, is deduced
from the oranges, lemons, citrons, ro&s;es,
narci&s;&s;us's, july-flowers, and jonquils, which
ripen and blow in the middle of winter. I
have de&s;cribed the agreeable &s;ide of this cli|mate;
and now I will point out its inconve|niences.
In the winter, but e&s;pecially in the
&s;pring, the &s;un is &s;o hot, that one can hardly
take exerci&s;e of any &s;ort abroad, without be|ing
thrown into a breathing &s;weat; and the
wind at this &s;ea&s;on is &s;o cold and piercing,
that it often produces a mi&s;chievous effect on
the pores thus opened. If the heat rarifies
the blood and juices, while the cold air con|&s;tringes
the fibres, and ob&s;tructs the per&s;pi|ration,
inflammatory di&s;orders mu&s;t en&s;ue.
Accordingly, the people are then &s;ubject to
colds, pleuri&s;ies, peripneumonies, and ardent
fevers. An old count advi&s;ed me to &s;tay
within doors in March, <HI>car alors les humeurs
commencent a &s;e remuer.</HI> During the heats of
&s;ummer, &s;ome few per&s;ons of gro&s;s habits
have, in con&s;equence of violent exerci&s;e and
exce&s;s, been &s;eized with putrid fevers, at|tended
<PB N="367" REF="371">
with exanthemata, eri&s;ipelatous, and
miliary eruptions, which commonly prove
fatal: but the people in general are healthy,
even tho&s;e that take very little exerci&s;e: a
&s;trong pre&s;umption in favour of the climate!
As to medicine, I know nothing of the prac|tice
of the Nice phy&s;icians. Here are eleven
in all; but four or five make &s;hift to live by
the profe&s;&s;ion. They receive, by way of &s;ee,
ten &s;ols (an Engli&s;h &s;ix-pence) a vi&s;it, and
this but ill paid; &s;o you may gue&s;s whether
they are in a condition to &s;upport the dignity
of phy&s;ic; and whether any man, of a libe|ral
education, would bury him&s;elf at Nice
on &s;uch terms. I am acquainted with an
Italian phy&s;ician &s;ettled at Villa Franca, a
very good &s;ort of a man, who practi&s;es for a
certain &s;alary, rai&s;ed by annual contribution
among the better &s;ort of people; and an al|lowance
from the king, for vi&s;iting the &s;ick
belonging to the garri&s;on and the gallies.
The whole may amount to near thirty
pounds.</P>
<P>Among the inconveniences of this climate,
the vermin form no incon&s;iderable article.
Vipers and &s;nakes are found in the moun|tains.
<PB N="368" REF="372">
Our gardens &s;warm with lizzards&punc;
and there are &s;ome few &s;corpions; but as yet
I have &s;een but one of this &s;pecies. In &s;um|mer,
notwith&s;tanding all the care and pre|cautions
we can take, we are pe&s;tered with
incredible &s;warms of flies, fleas, and bugs;
but the gnats, or <HI>couzins,</HI> are more intole|rable
than all the re&s;t. In the day-time, it
is impo&s;&s;ible to keep the flies out of your
mouth, no&s;trils, eyes, and ears. They croud
into your milk, tea, chocolate, &s;oup, wine,
and water: they &s;oil your &s;ugar, contami|nate
your victuals, and devour your fruit;
they cover and defile your furniture, floors,
cielings, and indeed your whole body. As
&s;oon as candles are lighted, the <HI>couzins</HI> begin
to buz about your ears in myriads, and tor|ment
you with their &s;tings, &s;o that you have
no re&s;t nor re&s;pite 'till you get into bed,
where you are &s;ecured by your mu&s;quito-net.
This inclo&s;ure is very di&s;agreeable in hot
weather; and very inconvenient to tho&s;e,
who, like me, are &s;ubject to a cough and
&s;pitting. It is moreover ineffectual; for
&s;ome of tho&s;e cur&s;ed in&s;ects in&s;inuate them|&s;elves
within it, almo&s;t every night; and half
<PB N="369" REF="373">
a dozen of them are &s;ufficient to di&s;turb you
'till morning. This is a plague that conti|nues
all the year; but in &s;ummer it is into|lerable.
During this &s;ea&s;on, likewi&s;e, the
moths are &s;o mi&s;chievous, that it requires
the utmo&s;t care to pre&s;erve woollen cloths
from being de&s;troyed. From the month of
May, 'till the beginning of October, the
heat is &s;o violent, that you cannot &s;tir abroad
after &s;ix in the morning 'till eight at night,
&s;o that you are entirely deprived of the bene|fit
of exerci&s;e. There is no &s;haded walk in,
or near the town; and there is neither coach
nor chai&s;e to hire, unle&s;s you travel po&s;t. In|deed,
there is no road fit for any wheel carri|age,
but the common highway to the Var, in
which you are &s;corched by the reflexion of
the &s;un from the &s;and and &s;tones, and at the
&s;ame time half &s;tifled with du&s;t. If you ride
out in the cool of the evening, you will have
the di&s;advantage of returning in the dark.</P>
<P>Among the demerits of Nice, I mu&s;t al&s;o
mention the water which is u&s;ed in the city.
It is drawn from wells; and for the mo&s;t part
&s;o hard, that it curdles with &s;oap. There
are many fountains and &s;treams in the neigh|bourhood,
<PB N="370" REF="374">
that afford excellent water, which,
at no great charge, might be conveyed into
the town, &s;o as to form conduits in all the
public &s;treets: but the inhabitants are either
de&s;titute of public &s;pirit, or cannot afford
the expence. I have a draw-well in my
porch, and another in my garden, which
&s;upply tolerable water for culinary u&s;es; but
what we drink, is fetched from a well belong|ing
to a convent of Dominicans in this neigh|bourhood.
Our linnen is wa&s;hed in the river
Paglion; and when that is dry, in the brook
called Limpia, which runs into the harbour.</P>
<P>In mentioning the water of this neigh|bourhood,
I ought not to omit the baths of
Rocabiliare, a &s;mall town among the moun|tains,
about five and twenty miles from
Nice. There are three &s;ources, each warmer
than the other; the warme&s;t being nearly
equal to the heat of the king's bath at Bath
in Somer&s;et&s;hire, as far as I can judge from
information. I have peru&s;ed a Latin manu|&s;cript,
which treats of the&s;e baths at Rocabi|li$$e,
written by the duke of Savoy's fir&s;t
phy&s;ician about &s;ixty years ago. He talks
much of the &s;ulphur and the nit$e which they
<PB N="371" REF="375">
contain: but I apprehend their efficacy is
owing to the &s;ame volatile vitriolic principle,
which characteri&s;es the waters at Bath. They
are attenuating and deob&s;truent, con&s;equently
of &s;ervice in di&s;orders ari&s;ing from a languid
circulation, a vi&s;cidity of the juices, a lax
fibre, and ob&s;tructed vi&s;cera. The road from
hence to Rocabiliare is in &s;ome parts very
dangerous, lying along the brink of preci|pices,
impa&s;&s;able to any other carriage but a
mule. The town it&s;elf affords bad lodging
and accommodation, and little or no &s;ociety.
The waters are at the di&s;tance of a mile and
a half from the town: there are no baths
nor &s;helter, nor any &s;ort of convenience for
tho&s;e that drink them; and the be&s;t part of
their efficacy is lo&s;t, unle&s;s they are drank at
the fountain-head. If the&s;e objections were
in &s;ome mea&s;ure removed, I would advi&s;e
valetudinarians, who come hither for the
benefit of this climate, to pa&s;s the heats of
&s;ummer at Rocabiliare, which being &s;ituated
among mountains, enjoys a cool temperate
air all the &s;ummer. This would be a &s;alu|tary
re&s;pite from the &s;alt air of Nice, to tho&s;e
who labour under &s;corbutical complaints;
<PB N="372" REF="376">
and they would return with fre&s;h vigour and
&s;pirits, to pa&s;s the winter in this place, where
no &s;everity of weather is known. La&s;t June,
when I found my&s;elf &s;o ill at my <HI>ca&s;&s;ine,</HI> I
had determined to go to Rocabiliare, and
even to erect a hut at the &s;pring, for my
own convenience. A gentleman of Nice un|dertook
to procure me a tolerable lodging in
the hou&s;e of the cur&eacute;, who was his relation.
He a&s;&s;ured me, there was no want of fre&s;h
butter, good poultry, excellent veal, and deli|cate
trout; and that the articles of living might
be had at Rocabiliare for half the price we
paid at Nice: but finding my&s;elf grow better
immediately on my return from the <HI>ca&s;&s;ine</HI> to
my own hou&s;e, I would not put my&s;elf to the
trouble and expence of a further removal.</P>
<P>I think I have now communicated all the
particulars relating to Nice, that are worth
knowing; and perhaps many more than you
de&s;ired to know: but, in &s;uch ca&s;es, I would
rather be thought prolix and unentertaining,
than deficient in that regard and attention
with which I am very &s;incerely,</P>
