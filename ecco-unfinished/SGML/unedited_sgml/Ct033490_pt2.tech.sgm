<HEAD>ESSAY I.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of COMMERCE.</HEAD>
<P>THE greate&s;t part of mankind may be divided
into two cla&s;&s;es; that of <HI>&s;hallow</HI> thinkers,
who fall &s;hort of the truth; and that of <HI>ab|&s;tru&s;e</HI>
thinkers, who go beyond it. The latter cla&s;s are
by far the mo&s;t uncommon; and I may add, by far
the mo&s;t u&s;eful and valuable. They &s;ugge&s;t hints, at
lea&s;t, and &s;tart difficulties, which they want, perhaps,
&s;kill to pur&s;ue; but which may produce very fine di&s;|coveries,
when handled by men who have a more ju&s;t
way of thinking. At wor&s;t, what they &s;ay is un|common;
and if it &s;hould co&s;t &s;ome pains to compre|hend
it, one has, however, the plea&s;ure of hearing
&s;omething that is new. An author is little to be va|lued,
who tells us nothing but what we can learn from
every coffee-hou&s;e conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>ALL people of <HI>&s;hallow</HI> thought are apt to decry even
tho&s;e of <HI>&s;olid</HI> under&s;tanding, as <HI>ab&s;tru&s;e</HI> thinkers, and
metaphy&s;icians, and refiners; and never will allow
<PB N="4" REF="7">
any thing to be ju&s;t which is beyond their own weak
conceptions. There are &s;ome ca&s;es, I own, where
an extraordinary refinement affords a &s;trong pre&s;ump|tion
of fal&s;ehood, and where no rea&s;oning is to be
tru&s;ted out what is natural and ea&s;y. When a man
deliberates concerning his conduct in any <HI>particular</HI>
affair, and forms &s;chemes in politics, trade, oecono|my,
or any bu&s;ine&s;s in life, he never ought to draw
his arguments too fine, or connect too long a chain of
con&s;equences together. Something is &s;ure to happen,
that will di&s;concert his rea&s;oning, and produce an
event different from what he expected. But when
we rea&s;on upon <HI>general</HI> &s;ubjects, one may ju&s;tly affirm,
that our &s;peculations can &s;carce ever be too fine,
provided they be ju&s;t; and that the difference be|tween
a common man and a man of genius is chiefly
&s;een in the &s;hallowne&s;s or depth of the principles up|on
which they proceed. General rea&s;onings &s;eem in|tricate,
merely becau&s;e they are general; nor is it
ea&s;y for the bulk of mankind to di&s;tingui&s;h, in a great
number of particulars, that common circum&s;tance in
which they all agree, or to extract it, pure and un|mixed,
from the other &s;uperfluous circum&s;tances.
Every judgment or conclu&s;ion, with them, is parti|cular.
They cannot enlarge their view to tho&s;e uni|ver&s;al
propo&s;itions, which comprehend under them an
infinite number of individuals, and include a whole
&s;cience in a &s;ingle theorem. Their eye is confounded
with &s;uch an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect; and the conclu&s;ions
<PB N="5" REF="8">
derived from it, even tho' clearly expre&s;&s;ed, &s;eem in|tricate
and ob&s;cure. But however intricate they may
&s;eem, 'tis certain, that general principles, if ju&s;t and
&s;ound, mu&s;t always prevail in the general cour&s;e of
things, tho' they may fail in particular ca&s;es; and
'tis the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of philo&s;ophers to regard the
general cour&s;e of things. I may add, that 'tis al&s;o
the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of politicians; e&s;pecially in the do|me&s;tic
government of the &s;tate, where the public
good, which is, or ought to be their object, depends
on the concurrence of a multitude of ca&s;es; not,
as in foreign politics, on accidents, and chances,
and the caprices of a few per&s;ons. This therefore
makes the difference betwixt <HI>particular</HI> deliberations
and <HI>general</HI> rea&s;onings, and renders &s;ubtilty and re|finement
much more &s;uitable to the latter than to the
former.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT this introduction nece&s;&s;ary before the
following di&s;cour&s;es on <HI>commerce, money, intere&s;t, balance
of trade, &amp;c.</HI> where, perhaps, there will occur &s;ome prin|ciples
which are uncommon, and which may &s;eem too
refined and &s;ubtile for &s;uch vulgar &s;ubjects. If fal&s;e,
let them be rejected: But no one ought to entertain a
prejudice again&s;t them, merely becau&s;e they are out
of the common road.</P>
<P>THE greatne&s;s of a &s;tate, and the happine&s;s of its
&s;ubjects, however independent they may be &s;uppo&s;ed
<PB N="6" REF="9">
in &s;ome re&s;pects, are commonly allowed to be in&s;epa|rable
with regard to commerce; and as private men
receive greater &s;ecurity, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their trade
and riches, from the power of the public, &s;o the pub|lic
becomes powerful in proportion to the riches and
exten&s;ive commerce of private men. This maxim is
true in general; tho' I cannot forbear thinking, that
it may po&s;&s;ibly admit of &s;ome exceptions, and that
we often e&s;tabli&s;h it with too little re&s;erve and limi|tation.
There may be &s;ome circum&s;tances, where the
commerce, and riches, and luxury of individuals, in|&s;tead
of adding &s;trength to the public, will &s;erve only
to thin its armies, and dimini&s;h its authority among
the neighbouring nations. Man is a very variable be|ing,
and &s;u&s;ceptible of many different opinions, prin|ciples,
and rules of conduct. What may be true
while he adheres to one way of thinking, will be
found fal&s;e when he has embraced an oppo&s;ite &s;et of
manners and opinions.</P>
<P>THE bulk of every &s;tate may be divided into <HI>hu&s;|bandmen</HI>
and <HI>manufacturers.</HI> The former are employed
in the culture of the land: The latter work up the
materials furni&s;hed by the former, into all the com|modities
which are nece&s;&s;ary or ornamental to human
life. As &s;oon as men quit their &s;avage &s;tate, where
they live chiefly by hunting and fi&s;hing, they mu&s;t
fall into the&s;e two cla&s;&s;es; tho' the arts of agriculture
employ <HI>at fir&s;t</HI> the mo&s;t numerous part of the &s;o|ciety<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Mon&s;. MELON in his political e&s;&s;ay on commerce a&s;&s;erts, that even at pre&s;ent, if you divide FRANCE into 20 parts, 16 are labourers or pea&s;ants; 2 only artizans; one belonging to the law, church, and military; and one merchants, financiers, and bourgeois. This calculation is certainly very erroneous. In FRANCE, ENGLAND, and indeed mo&s;t parts of EUROPE, half of the inhabitants live in cities; and even of tho&s;e who live in the country, a very great number are arti&s;ans, perhaps above a third.</NOTE>.
<PB N="7" REF="10">
Time and experience improve &s;o much the&s;e
arts, that the land may ea&s;ily maintain a much greater
number of men, than tho&s;e who are immediately
employed in its cultivation, or who furni&s;h the more
nece&s;&s;ary manufactures to &s;uch as are &s;o employed.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e &s;uperfluous hands apply them&s;elves to the
finer arts, which are commonly denominated the arts
of <HI>luxury,</HI> they add to the happine&s;s of the &s;tate;
&s;ince they afford to many the opportunity of receiving
enjoyments, with which they would otherwi&s;e have
been unacquainted. But may not another &s;cheme be
propo&s;ed for the employment of the&s;e &s;uperfluous
hands? May not the &s;overeign lay claim to them,
and employ them in fleets and armies, to increa&s;e
the dominions of the &s;tate abroad, and &s;pread its
fame over di&s;tant nations? 'Tis certain, that the fewer
de&s;ires and wants are found in the proprietors and la|bourers
of land, the fewer hands do they employ;
<PB N="8" REF="11">
and con&s;equently the &s;uperfluities of the land, in&s;tead
of maintaining trade&s;men and manufacturers, may
&s;upport fleets and armies to a much greater extent,
than where a great many arts are required to mini|&s;ter
to the luxury of particular per&s;ons. Here there|fore
&s;eems to be a kind of oppo&s;ition between the
greatne&s;s of the &s;tate and the happine&s;s of the &s;ub|jects.
A &s;tate is never greater than when all its &s;u|perfluous
hands are employed in the &s;ervice of the
public. The ea&s;e and convenience of private per&s;ons
require, that the&s;e hands &s;hould be employed in their
&s;ervice. The one can never be &s;atisfied, but at the
expence of the other. As the ambition of the &s;ove|reign
mu&s;t entrench on the luxury of individuals; &s;o
the luxury of individuals mu&s;t dimini&s;h the force,
and check the ambition of the &s;overeign.</P>
<P>NOR is this rea&s;oning merely chimerical; but is
founded on hi&s;tory and experience. The republic of
SPARTA was certainly more powerful than any &s;tate now
in the world, con&s;i&s;ting of an equal number of people:
and this was owing entirely to the want of commerce
and luxury. The HELOTES were the labourers: The
SPARTANS were the &s;oldiers or gentlemen. 'Tis evi|dent,
that the labour of the HELOTES could not have
maintained &s;o great a number of SPARTANS, had
the&s;e latter lived in ca&s;e and delicacy, and given em|ployment
to a great variety of trades and manufac|tures.
<PB N="9" REF="12">
The like policy may be remarked in ROME.
And indeed, thro' all antient hi&s;tory, 'tis ob&s;ervable,
that the &s;malle&s;t republics rai&s;ed and maintained great|er
armies, than &s;tates con&s;i&s;ting of triple the number
of inhabitants, are able to &s;upport at pre&s;ent. 'Tis
computed, that, in all EUROPEAN nations, the pro|portion
between &s;oldiers and people does not exceed
one to a hundred. But we read, that the city of
ROME alone, with its &s;mall territory, rai&s;ed and
maintained, in early times, ten legions again&s;t the
LATINS. ATHENS, who&s;e whole dominions were
not larger than YORKSHIRE, &s;ent to the expedition
again&s;t SICILY near forty thou&s;and men<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">THUCYDIDES, lib. 7.</NOTE>. DIONY|SIUS
the elder, 'tis &s;aid, maintained a &s;tanding army
of a hundred thou&s;and foot and ten thou&s;and hor&s;e,
be&s;ide a large fleet of four hundred &s;ail<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 2. This account, I own, is &s;omewhat &s;u&s;picious, not to &s;ay wor&s;e; chiefly becau&s;e this army was not compo&s;ed of citizens, but of mercenary forces.</NOTE>; tho' his
territories extended no farther than the city of SYRA|CUSE,
about a third part of the i&s;land of SICILY, and
&s;ome &s;ea-port towns or garri&s;ons on the coa&s;t of ITA|LY
and ILLYRICUM. 'Tis true, the antient armies,
in time of war, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted much upon plunder: But
did not the enemy plunder in their turn? which was
a more ruinous way of levying a tax, than any other
that could be devi&s;ed. In &s;hort, no probable rea&s;on
<PB N="10" REF="13">
can be a&s;&s;igned for the great power of the more antient
&s;tates above the modern, but their want of commerce
and luxury. Few arti&s;ans were maintained by the
labour of the farmers, and therefore more &s;oldiers
might live upon it. TITUS LIVIUS &s;ays, that ROME,
in his time, would find it difficult to rai&s;e as large an
army as that which, in her early days, &s;he &s;ent out
again&s;t the GAULS and LATINS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">TITI LIVII, lib. 7. cap. 24. &startq;Adeo in quae laboramus,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;&s;ola crevimus, divitias luxuriemque.&endq;</NOTE>. In&s;tead of tho&s;e
&s;oldiers who fought for liberty and empire in CA|MILLUS'S
time, there were in AUGUSTUS'S days, mu|&s;icians,
painters, cooks, players, and tailors; and if
the land was equally cultivated at both periods, 'tis
evident it could maintain equal numbers in the one
profe&s;&s;ion as in the other. They added nothing to
the mere nece&s;&s;aries of life, in the latter period more
than in the former.</P>
<P>'TIS natural on this occa&s;ion to a&s;k, whether &s;ove|reigns
may not return to the maxims of antient po|licy,
and con&s;ult their own intere&s;t, in this re&s;pect,
more than the happine&s;s of their &s;ubjects? I an&s;wer,
that it appears to me almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible; and that be|cau&s;e
antient policy was violent, and contrary to the
more natural and u&s;ual cour&s;e of things. 'Tis well
known with what peculiar laws SPARTA was govern|ed,
<PB N="11" REF="14">
and what a prodigy that republic is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed
by every one, who has con&s;idered human nature, as
it has di&s;played it&s;elf on other nations, and other
ages. Were the te&s;timony of hi&s;tory le&s;s po&s;itive and
circum&s;tantial, &s;uch a government would appear a
mere philo&s;ophical whim or fiction, and impo&s;&s;ible
ever to be reduced to practice. And tho' the ROMAN
and other antient republics were &s;upported on prin|ciples
&s;omewhat more natural, yet was there a very
extraordinary concurrence of circum&s;tances to make
them &s;ubmit to &s;uch grievous burthens. They were
free &s;tates; they were &s;mall ones; and the age being
martial, all the neighbouring &s;tates were continually
in arms. Freedom naturally begets public &s;pirit, e&s;pe|cially
in &s;mall &s;tates; and this public &s;pirit, this <HI>amor
patriae,</HI> mu&s;t increa&s;e, when the public is almo&s;t in
continual alarm, and men are obliged, every mo|ment,
to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the greate&s;t dangers
for its defence. A continual &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of wars makes
every citizen a &s;oldier: He takes the field in his turn;
and during his &s;ervice is chiefly maintained by him&s;elf.
And, notwith&s;tanding that his &s;ervice is equivalent to
a very &s;evere tax, 'tis le&s;s felt by a people addicted
to arms, who fight for honour and revenge more than
pay, and are unacquainted with gain and indu&s;try as
well as plea&s;ure<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The more antient ROMANS lived in perpetual war with all their neighbours: and in old LATIN, the term, <HI>ho&s;tis,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed both a &s;tranger and an enemy. This is remarked by CICERO; but by him is a&s;cribed to the humanity of his ance&s;tors, who &s;oftened, as much as po&s;&s;ible, the denomination of an enemy, by calling him by the &s;ame appellation which &s;ignified a &s;tranger. <HI>De Off.</HI> lib. 2. 'Tis however much more probable, from the manners of the times, that the ferocity of tho&s;e people was &s;o great as to make them regard all &s;trangers as enemies, and call them by the &s;ame name. It is not, be&s;ides, con&s;i&s;tent with the mo&s;t common maxims of policy or of nature, that any &s;tate &s;hould regard its public enemies with a friendly eye, or pre&s;erve any &s;uch &s;entiments for them as the ROMAN orator would afcribe to his ance&s;tors. Not to mention, that the early ROMANS re|ally exerci&s;ed piracy, as we learn from their fir&s;t treaties with CARTHAGE, pre&s;erved by POLYBIUS, lib. 3. and con&s;equently like the SALLEE and ALGERINE rovers, were actually at war with mo&s;t nations, and a &s;tranger and an enemy were with them almo&s;t &s;ynonymous.</NOTE>. Not to mention the great equa|lity
<PB N="12" REF="15">
of fortunes among&s;t the inhabitants of the antient
republics, where every field belonging to a different
proprietor, was able to maintain a family, and ren|dered
the numbers of citizens very con&s;iderable, even
without trade and manufactures.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the want of trade and manufactures,
among&s;t a free and very martial people, may <HI>&s;ometimes</HI>
have no other effect than to render the public more
powerful, 'tis certain, that in the common cour&s;e of
human affairs, it will have a quite contrary tendency.
Sovereigns mu&s;t take mankind as they find them, and
<PB N="13" REF="16">
cannot pretend to introduce any violent change in
their principles and ways of thinking. A long cour&s;e
of time, with a variety of accidents and circum&s;tances,
are requi&s;ite to produce tho&s;e great revolutions, which
&s;o much diver&s;ify the face of human affairs. And
the le&s;s natural any &s;et of principles are, which &s;up|port
a particular &s;ociety, the more difficult will a le|gi&s;lator
meet with in rai&s;ing and cultivating them.
'Tis his be&s;t policy to comply with the common bent
of mankind, and give it all the improvements of
which it is &s;u&s;ceptible. Now, according to the mo&s;t
natural cour&s;e of things, indu&s;try, and arts, and trade
increa&s;e the power of the &s;overeign as well as the
happine&s;s of the &s;ubjects; and that policy is violent,
which aggrandizes the public by the poverty of indi|viduals.
This will ea&s;ily appear from a few con&s;ide|rations,
which will pre&s;ent to us the con&s;equences of
&s;loth and barbarity.</P>
<P>WHERE manufactures and mechanic arts are not
cultivated, the bulk of the people mu&s;t apply them|&s;elves
to agriculture; and if their &s;kill and indu&s;try
increa&s;e, there mu&s;t ari&s;e a great &s;uperfluity from their
labour beyond what &s;uffices to maintain them. They
have no temptation, therefore, to increa&s;e their &s;kill
and indu&s;try; fince they cannot exchange that &s;uper|fluity
for any commodities, which may &s;erve either
to their plea&s;ure or vanity. A habit of indolence
naturally prevails. The greater part of the land lies
<PB N="14" REF="17">
uncultivated. What is cultivated, yields not its ut|mo&s;t,
for want of &s;kill or a&s;&s;iduity in the farmers. If
at any time the public exigencies require, that great
numbers &s;hould be employed in the public &s;ervice,
the labour of the people furni&s;hes now no &s;uperflui|ties,
by which the&s;e numbers can be maintained. The
labourers cannot increa&s;e their &s;kill and indu&s;try on a
&s;udden. Lands uncultivated cannot be brought into
tillage for &s;ome years. The armies, mean while,
mu&s;t either make &s;udden and violent conque&s;ts, or
di&s;band for want of &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. A regular attack or
defence, therefore, is not to be expected from &s;uch
a people, and their &s;oldiers mu&s;t be as ignorant and
un&s;kilful as their farmers and manufacturers.</P>
<P>EVERY thing in the world is purcha&s;ed by labour;
and our pa&s;&s;ions are the only cau&s;es of labour. When
a nation abounds in manufactures and mechanic arts,
the proprietors of land, as well as the farmers, study
agriculture as a &s;cience, and redouble their indu&s;try
and attention. The &s;uperfluity which ari&s;es from
their labour, is not lo&s;t; but is exchanged with the
manufacturers for tho&s;e commodities which means lux|ury
now makes them covet. By this means, land
furni&s;hes a great deal more of the nece&s;&s;aries of life,
than what &s;uffices for tho&s;e who cultivate it. In times
of peace and tranquility, this &s;uperfluity goes to the
maintenance of manufacturers, and the improvers of
liberal arts. But 'tis ea&s;y for the public to convert
<PB N="15" REF="18">
many of the&s;e manufacturers into &s;oldiers, and main|tain
them by that &s;uperfluity, which ari&s;es from the
labour of the farmers. Accordingly we find, that
this is the ca&s;e in all civilized governments. When
the &s;overeign rai&s;es an army, what is the con&s;equence?
He impo&s;es a tax. This tax obliges all the people
to retrench what is lea&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to their &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.
Tho&s;e who labour in &s;uch commodities, mu&s;t either
enli&s;t in the troops, or turn them&s;elves to agriculture,
and thereby oblige &s;ome labourers to enli&s;t for want
of bu&s;ine&s;s. And to con&s;ider the matter ab&s;tractly,
manufactures increa&s;e the power of the &s;tate only as
they &s;tore up &s;o much labour, and that of a kind to
which the public may lay claim, without depriving
any one of the nece&s;&s;aries of life. The more labour,
therefore, is employed beyond mere nece&s;&s;aries, the
more powerful is any &s;tate; &s;ince the per&s;ons en|gaged
in that labour may ea&s;ily be converted to the
public &s;ervice. In a &s;tate without manufactures, there
may be the &s;ame number of hands; but there is not
the &s;ame quantity of labour, nor of the &s;ame kind.
All the labour is there be&s;towed upon nece&s;&s;aries,
which can admit of little or no abatement.</P>
<P>THUS the greatne&s;s of the &s;overeign and the hap|pine&s;s
of the &s;tate are, in a great mea&s;ure, united
with regard to trade and manufactures. 'Tis a vio|lent
method, and in mo&s;t ca&s;es impracticable, to oblige
the labourer to toil, in order to rai&s;e from the land
more than what &s;ub&s;i&s;ts him&s;elf and family. Furni&s;h
<PB N="16" REF="19">
him with manufactures and commodities, and he will
do it of him&s;elf. Afterwards you will find it ea&s;y to
&s;eize &s;ome part of his &s;uperfluous labour, and employ
it in the public &s;ervice, without giving him his wonted
return. Being accu&s;tomed to indu&s;try, he will think
this le&s;s grievous, than if, at once, you obliged him to
an augmentation of labour without any reward. The
ca&s;e is the &s;ame with regard to the other members of
the &s;tate. The greater is the &s;tock of labour of all
kinds, the greater quantity may be taken from the
heap, without making any &s;en&s;ible alteration upon it.</P>
<P>A PUBLIC granary of corn, a &s;torehou&s;e of cloth,
a magazine of arms; all the&s;e mu&s;t be allowed real
riches and &s;trength in any &s;tate. Trade and indu&s;try
are really nothing but a &s;tock of labour, which, in
time of peace and tranquility, is employed for the
ea&s;e and &s;atisfaction of individuals; but in the exigen|cies
of &s;tate, may, in part, be turned to public ad|vantage.
Could we convert a city into a kind of for|tified
camp, and infu&s;e into each brea&s;t &s;o martial a
genius, and &s;uch a pa&s;&s;ion for public good, as to
make every one willing to undergo the greate&s;t hard|&s;hips
for the &s;ake of the public; the&s;e affections might
now, as in antient times, prove alone a &s;ufficient &s;pur
to indu&s;try, and &s;upport the community. It would
then be advantageous, as in camps, to bani&s;h all arts
and luxury; and, by re&s;trictions on equipage and
tables, make the provi&s;ions and forage la&s;t longer than
if the army were loaded with a number of &s;uperflu|ous
<PB N="17" REF="20">
retainers. But as the&s;e principles are too di&s;inte|re&s;ted
and too difficult to &s;upport, 'tis requi&s;ite to
govern men by other pa&s;&s;ions, and animate them with
a &s;pirit of avarice and indu&s;try, art and luxury. The
camp is, in this ca&s;e, loaded with a &s;uperfluous reti|nue;
but the provi&s;ions flow in proportionably larger.
The harmony of the whole is &s;till &s;upported; and
the natural bent of the mind being more complied
with, individuals, as well as the public, find their
account in the ob&s;ervance of tho&s;e maxims.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame method of rea&s;oning will let us &s;ee the
advantage of <HI>foreign</HI> commerce, in augmenting the
power of the &s;tate, as well as the riches and happi|ne&s;s
of the &s;ubjects. It increa&s;es the &s;tock of labour
in the nation; and the &s;overeign may convert what
&s;hare of it he finds nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ervice of the pub|lic.
Foreign trade, by its imports, furni&s;hes mate|rials
for new manufactures; and by its exports, it
produces labour in particular commodities, which
could not be con&s;umed at home. In &s;hort, a king|dom,
that has a large import and export, mu&s;t abound
more with indu&s;try, and that employed upon delica|cies
and luxuries, than a kingdom which re&s;ts content|ed
with its native commodities. It is, therefore, more
powerful, as well as richer and happier. The indivi|duals
reap the benefit of the&s;e commodities, &s;o far
as they gratify the &s;en&s;es and appetites. And the pub|lic
is al&s;o a gainer, while a greater &s;tock of labour is,
<PB N="18" REF="21">
by this means, &s;tored up again&s;t any public exigency;
that is, a greater number of laborious men are main|tained,
who may be diverted to the public &s;ervice,
without robbing any one of the nece&s;&s;aries, or even
the chief conveniencies of life.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ult hi&s;tory, we &s;hall find, that in mo&s;t
nations foreign trade has preceded any refinement in
home manufactures, and given birth to dome&s;tic lux|ury.
The temptation is &s;tronger to make u&s;e of fo|reign
commodities, which are ready for u&s;e, and which
are entirely new to us, than to make improvements
on any dome&s;tic commodity, which always advance by
&s;low degrees, and never affect us by their novelty,
The profit is al&s;o very great, in exporting what is
&s;uperfluous at home, and what bears no price, to fo|reign
nations, who&s;e &s;oil or climate is not favourable
to that commodity. Thus men become acquainted
with the <HI>plea&s;ures</HI> of luxury and the <HI>profits</HI> of com|merce;
and their <HI>delicacy</HI> and <HI>indu&s;try,</HI> being once
awakened, carry them to farther improvements, in
every branch of dome&s;tic as well as foreign trade.
And this perhaps is the chief advantage which ari&s;es
from a commerce with &s;trangers. It rou&s;es men
from their indolence; and pre&s;enting the gayer and
more opulent part of the nation with objects of luxury,
which they never before dreamed of, rai&s;es in them a
de&s;ire of a more &s;plendid way of life than what their
ance&s;tors enjoyed. And at the &s;ame time, the few
<PB N="19" REF="22">
merchants, who po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ecret of this importation
and exportation, make exorbitant profits; and becom|ing
rivals in wealth to the antient nobility, tempt other
adventurers to become their rivals in commerce. Imi|tation
&s;oon diffu&s;es all tho&s;e arts; while dome&s;tic ma|nufacturers
emulate the foreign in their improvements,
and work up every home commodity to the utmo&s;t
perfection of which it is &s;u&s;ceptible. Their own &s;teel
and iron, in &s;uch laborious hands, become equal to
the gold and rubies of the INDIES.</P>
<P>WHEN the affairs of the &s;ociety are once brought
to this &s;ituation, a nation may lo&s;e mo&s;t of its foreign
trade, and yet continue a great and powerful people.
If &s;trangers will not take any particular commodity of
ours, we mu&s;t cea&s;e to labour in it. The &s;ame hands
will turn them&s;elves towards &s;ome refinement in other
commodities, which may be wanted at home. And
there mu&s;t always be materials for them to work up|on;
till every per&s;on in the &s;tate, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es riches,
enjoys as great plenty of home commodities, and
tho&s;e in as great perfection, as he de&s;ires; which can
never po&s;&s;ibly happen. CHINA is repre&s;ented as one
of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing empires in the world; tho' it
has very little commerce beyond its own territories.</P>
<P>IT will not, I hope, be con&s;idered as a &s;uperfluous
digre&s;&s;ion, if I here ob&s;erve, that as the multitude of
mechanical arts is advantageous, &s;o is the great num|ber
<PB N="20" REF="23">
of per&s;ons to who&s;e &s;hare the productions of the&s;e
arts fall. A too great di&s;proportion among the citi|zens
weakens any &s;tate. Every per&s;on, if po&s;&s;ible,
ought to enjoy the fruits of his labour, in a full po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of all the nece&s;&s;aries, and many of the conve|nience
of life. No one can doubt, but &s;uch an equa|lity
is mo&s;t &s;uitable to human nature, and dimini&s;hes
much le&s;s from the <HI>happine&s;s</HI> of the rich than it adds
to that of the poor. If al&s;o augments the <HI>power of
the &s;tate,</HI> and makes any extraordinary taxes or impo|&s;itions
be paid with much more chearfulne&s;s. Where
the riches are engro&s;&s;ed by a few, the&s;e mu&s;t contri|bute
very largely to the &s;upplying the public nece&s;|&s;ities.
But when the riches are di&s;per&s;ed among mul|titudes,
the burthen feels light on every &s;houlder,
and the taxes make not a very &s;en&s;ible difference on
any one's way of living.</P>
<P>ADD to this, that where the riches are in few hands,
the&s;e mu&s;t enjoy all the power, and will readily con|&s;pire
to lay the whole burthen on the poor, and op|pre&s;s
them &s;till farther, to the di&s;couragement of all
indu&s;try.</P>
<P>IN this circum&s;tance con&s;i&s;ts the great advantage of
ENGLAND above any nation at pre&s;ent in the world,
or that appears in the records of any &s;tory. 'Tis true,
the ENGLISH feel &s;ome di&s;advantages in foreign trade
by the high price of labour, which is in part the ef|fect
<PB N="21" REF="24">
of the riches of their arti&s;ans, as well as of the
plenty of money: But as foreign trade is not the
mo&s;t material circum&s;tance, 'tis not to be put in com|petition
with the happine&s;s of &s;o many millions. And
if there were no more to endear to them that free
government under which they live, this alone were
&s;ufficient. The poverty of the common people is a
natural, if not an infallible effect of ab&s;olute mo|narchy;
tho' I doubt, whether it be always true,
on the other hand, that their riches are an infallible
re&s;ult of liberty. Liberty mu&s;t be attended with par|ticular
accidents, and a certain turn of thinking, in
order to produce that effect. Lord BACON, account|ing
for the great advantages obtained by the ENGLISH
in their wars with FRANCE, a&s;cribes them chiefly
to the &s;uperior ea&s;e and plenty of the common peo|ple
among&s;t the former; yet the governments of the
two kingdoms were, at that time, pretty much alike.
Where the labourers and artizans are accu&s;tomed to
work for low wages, and to a retain but a &s;mall part
of the fruits of their labour, 'tis difficult for them,
even in a free government, to better their condition,
or con&s;pire among them&s;elves to heighten their wages.
But even where they are accu&s;tomed to a more plen|tiful
way of life, 'tis ea&s;y for the rich, in a de&s;potic
government, to con&s;pire again&s;t <HI>them,</HI> and throw the
whole burthen of the taxes on their &s;houlders.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="25">
IT may &s;eem an odd po&s;ition, that the poverty of
the common people in FRANCE, ITALY, and SPAIN,
is, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, owing to the &s;uperior riches of
the &s;oil and happine&s;s of the climate; and yet there
want not many rea&s;ons to ju&s;tify this paradox. In
&s;uch a fine mold or &s;oil as that of tho&s;e more &s;outhern
regions, agriculture is an ea&s;y art; and one man,
with a couple of &s;orry hor&s;es, will be able, in a &s;ea|&s;on,
to cultivate as much land as will pay a pretty
con&s;iderable rent to the proprietor. All the art, which
the farmer knows, is to leave his ground fallow for a
year, &s;o &s;oon as it is exhau&s;ted; and the warmth of
the &s;un alone and temperature of the climate enrich
it, and re&s;tore its fertility. Such poor pea&s;ants, there|fore,
require only a &s;imple maintenance for their la|bour.
They have no &s;tock nor riches, which claim
more; and at the &s;ame time, they are for ever depen|dant
on their landlord, who gives no lea&s;es, nor fears
that his land will be &s;poiled by the ill methods of cul|tivation.
In ENGLAND, the land is rich, but coar&s;e;
mu&s;t be cultivated at a great expence; and produces
&s;lender crops, when not carefully managed, and by a
method which gives not the full profit but in a cour&s;e
of &s;everal years. A farmer, therefore, in ENGLAND
mu&s;t have a con&s;iderable &s;tock and a long lea&s;e; which
beget proportional profits. The fine vineyards of
CHAMPAGNE and BURGUNDY, that oft yield to the
landlord above five pounds <HI>per</HI> acre, are cultivated by
<PB N="23" REF="26">
pea&s;ants, who have &s;carce bread: And the rea&s;on is, that
&s;uch pea&s;ants need no &s;tock but their own limbs, with
in&s;truments of hu&s;bandry, which they can buy for
twenty &s;hillings. The farmers are commonly in &s;ome
better circum&s;tances in tho&s;e countries. But the gra|&s;iers
are mo&s;t at their ea&s;e of all tho&s;e who cultivate
the land. The rea&s;on is &s;till the &s;ame. Men mu&s;t
have profits proportionable to their expence and ha|zard.
Where &s;o con&s;iderable a number of the labour|ing
poor as the pea&s;ants and farmers are in very
low circum&s;tances, all the re&s;t mu&s;t partake of their
poverty, whether the government of that nation be
monarchical or republican.</P>
<P>WE may form a &s;imilar remark with regard to the
general hi&s;tory of mankind. What is the rea&s;on,
why no people living between the tropics could ever
yet attain to any art or civility, or reach even any
police in their government, and any military di&s;cip|line;
while few nations in the temperate climates
have been altogether deprived of the&s;e advantages?
'Tis probable, that one cau&s;e of this phaenomenon
is the warmth and equality of weather in the torrid
zone, which render cloaths and hou&s;es le&s;s requi&s;ite
for the inhabitants, and thereby remove, in part,
that nece&s;&s;ity, which is the great &s;pur to indu&s;try and
invention. <HI>Curis acuens mortalia corda:</HI> Not to men|tion,
<PB N="24" REF="27">
that the fewer goods or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of this kind
any people enjoy, the fewer quarrels are likely to
ari&s;e among&s;t them, and the le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity will there
be for a &s;ettled police or regular authority to protect
and defend them from foreign enemies, or from each
other.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of REFINEMENT in the ARTS.</HEAD>
<P>LUXURY is a word of a very uncertain &s;ignifi|cation,
and may be taken in a good as well as a
bad &s;en&s;e. In general, it means great refinement in
the gratification of the &s;en&s;es; and any degree of it
may be innocent or blameable, according to the age,
or country, or condition of the per&s;on. The bounds
between the virtue and the vice cannot here be fixed
exactly, more than in other moral &s;ubjects. To ima|gine,
that the gratifying any of the &s;en&s;es, or the in|dulging
any delicacy in meats, drinks, or apparel, is
of it&s;elf a vice, can never enter into a head, that is
not di&s;ordered by the frenzies of enthu&s;ia&s;m. I have,
indeed, heard of a monk abroad, who, becau&s;e the
windows of his cell opened upon a very noble pro|&s;pect,
made a <HI>covenant with his eyes</HI> never to turn that
way, or receive &s;o &s;en&s;ual a gratification. And &s;uch
is the crime of drinking CHAMPAGNE or BUR|GUNDY,
pre&s;erably to &s;mall beer or porter. The&s;e
indulgences are only vices, when they are pur&s;ued at
<PB N="26" REF="29">
the expence of &s;ome virtue, as liberality or charity;
in like manner as they are follies, when for them a
man ruins his fortune, and reduces him&s;elf to want
and beggary. Where they entrench upon no virtue,
but leave ample &s;ubject whence to provide for friends,
family, and every proper object of genero&s;ity or com|pa&s;&s;ion,
they are intirely innocent, and have in every
age been acknowledged &s;uch by almo&s;t all morali&s;ts.
To be intirely occupied with the luxury of the table,
for in&s;tance, without any reli&s;h for the plea&s;ures of
ambition, &s;tudy, or conver&s;ation, is a mark of gro&s;s
&s;tupidity, and is incompatible with any vigour of
temper or genius. To confine one's expence intirely
to &s;uch a gratification, without regard to friends or fa|mily,
is an indication of a heart intirely devoid of
humanity or benevolence. But if a man re&s;erve time
&s;ufficient for all laudable pur&s;uits, and money &s;ufficient
for all generous purpo&s;es, he is free from every &s;ha|dow
of blame or reproach.</P>
<P>SINCE luxury may be con&s;idered either as innocent
or blameable, one may be &s;urprized at tho&s;e prepo&s;|terous
opinions which have been entertained concern|ing
it; while men of libertine principles be&s;tow
prai&s;es even on vicious luxury, and repre&s;ent it as
highly advantageous to &s;ociety; and on the other
hand, men of &s;evere morals blame even the mo&s;t in|nocent
luxury, and repre&s;ent it as the &s;ource of all
the corruptions, di&s;orders, and factions, incident to
<PB N="27" REF="30">
civil government. We &s;hall here endeavour to cor|rect
both the&s;e extremes, by proving, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that the
ages of refinement are both the happie&s;t and mo&s;t vir|tuous;
<HI>&s;econdly,</HI> that where-ever luxury cea&s;es to be
innocent, it al&s;o cea&s;es to be beneficial; and when
carried a degree too far, is a quality pernicious, tho'
perhaps not the mo&s;t pernicious, to political &s;ociety.</P>
<P>To prove the fir&s;t point, we need but con&s;ider the
effects of refinement both on <HI>private</HI> and on <HI>public</HI>
life. Human happine&s;s, according to the mo&s;t re|ceived
notions, &s;eems to con&s;i&s;t in three ingredients;
action, plea&s;ure, and indolence: And tho' the&s;e in|gredients
ought to be mixed in different proportions,
according to the particular di&s;po&s;itions of the per&s;on;
yet no one ingredient can be intirely wanting, with|out
de&s;troying, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, the reli&s;h of the
whole compo&s;ition. Indolence or repo&s;e, indeed,
&s;eems not of it&s;elf to contribute much to our enjoy|ment;
but, like &s;leep, is requi&s;ite as an indulgence
to the weakne&s;s of human nature, which cannot &s;up|port
an uninterrupted cour&s;e of bu&s;ine&s;s or plea&s;ure.
That quick march of the &s;pirits, which takes a man
from him&s;elf, and chiefly gives &s;atisfaction, does in
the end exhau&s;t the mind, and requires &s;ome intervals
of repo&s;e, which, tho' agreeable for a moment, yet,
if prolonged, beget a languor and lethargy, that de|&s;troy
all enjoyment. Education, cu&s;tom, and exam|ple,
have a mighty influence in turning the mind to
<PB N="28" REF="31">
any of the&s;e pur&s;uits; and it mu&s;t be owned, that
where they promote a reli&s;h for action and plea&s;ure,
they are &s;o far favourable to human happine&s;s. In
times when indu&s;try and arts flouri&s;h, men are kept
in perpetual occupation, and enjoy, as their reward,
the occupation it&s;elf, as well as tho&s;e plea&s;ures which
are the fruits of their labour. The mind acquires new
vigour; enlarges its powers and faculties; and by an
a&s;&s;iduity in hone&s;t indu&s;try, both &s;atisfies its natural
appetites, and prevents the growth of unnatural ones,
which commonly &s;pring up, when nouri&s;hed with
ea&s;e and idlene&s;s. Bani&s;h tho&s;e arts from &s;ociety, you
deprive men both of action and of plea&s;ure; and
leaving nothing but indolence in their place, you
even de&s;tory the reli&s;h of indolence, which never is
agreeable, but when it &s;ucceeds to labour, and re|cruits
the &s;pirits, exhau&s;ted by too much application
and fatigue.</P>
<P>ANOTHER advantage of indu&s;try and of refine|ments
in the mechanical arts, is, that they common|ly
produce &s;ome refinements in the liberal arts; nor
can the one be carried to perfection, without being
accompanied, in &s;ome degree, with the other. The
&s;ame age which produces great philo&s;ophers and poli|ticians,
renowned generals and poets, u&s;ually abounds
with &s;kilful weavers and &s;hip-carpenters. We can|not
rea&s;onably expect, that a piece of woollen cloth
will be wrought to perfection in a nation which is ig|norant
<PB N="29" REF="32">
of a&s;tronomy, or where ethics are neglected.
The &s;pirit of the age affects all the arts; and the
minds of men, being once rou&s;ed from their lethar|gy,
and put into a fermentation, turn them&s;elves on
all &s;ides, and carry improvements into every art and
&s;cience. Profound ignorance is totally bani&s;hed, and
men enjoy the privilege of rational creatures, to
think as well as to act, to cultivate the plea&s;ures of
the mind as well as tho&s;e of the body.</P>
<P>THE more the&s;e refined arts advance, the more &s;o|ciable
do men become; nor is it po&s;&s;ible, that, when
inriched with &s;cience, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a fund of con|ver&s;ation,
they &s;hould be contented to remain in &s;oli|tude,
or live with their fellow-citizens in that di&s;tant
manner, which is peculiar to ignorant and barbarous
nations. They flock into cities; love to receive and
communicate knowledge; to &s;how their wit or their
breeding; their ta&s;te in conver&s;ation or living, in
cloaths or furniture. Curio&s;ity allures the wi&s;e; va|nity
the fooli&s;h; and plea&s;ure both. Particular clubs
and &s;ocieties are every where formed: Both &s;exes
meet in an ea&s;y and &s;ociable manner; and the tem|pers
of men, as well as their behaviour, refine apace.
So that, be&s;ide the improvements which they receive
from knowledge and the liberal arts, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible
but they mu&s;t feel an increa&s;e of humanity, from the
very habit of conver&s;ing together, and contributing
to each other's plea&s;ure and entertainment. Thus
<PB N="30" REF="33">
<HI>indu&s;try, knowledge,</HI> and <HI>humanity,</HI> are linked together
by an indi&s;&s;oluble chain, and are found, from expe|rience
as well as rea&s;on, to be peculiar to the more
poli&s;hed, and, what are commonly denominated, the
more luxurious ages.</P>
<P>NOR are the&s;e advantages attended with di&s;advan|tages
which bear any proportion to them. The more
men refine upon plea&s;ure, the le&s;s will they indulge in
exce&s;&s;es of any kind; becau&s;e nothing is more de|&s;tructive
to true plea&s;ure than &s;uch exce&s;&s;es. One
may &s;afely affirm, that the TARTARS are oftener
guilty of bea&s;tly gluttony, when they fea&s;t on their
dead hor&s;es, than EUROPEAN courtiers with all their
refinements of cookery. And if libertine love, or
even infidelity to the marriage-bed, be more frequent
in polite ages, when it is often regarded only as a
piece of gallantry; drunkenne&s;s, on the other hand,
is much le&s;s common: A vice more odious, and
more pernicious both to mind and body. And in
this matter I would appeal, not only to an OVID or
a PETRONIUS, but to a SENECA or a CATO. We
know, that CAESAR, during CATALINE<HI>'S</HI> con&s;piracy,
being nece&s;&s;itated to put into CATO's hands a <HI>billet|doux,</HI>
which di&s;covered an intrigue with SERVILIA
CATO's own &s;i&s;ter, that &s;tern philo&s;opher threw it
back to him with indignation; and, in the bitterne&s;s
of his wrath, gave him the appellation of drunkard,
<PB N="31" REF="34">
as a term more opprobrious than that with which he
could more ju&s;tly have reproached him.</P>
<P>BUT indu&s;try, knowledge, and humanity, are not
advantageous in private life alone: They diffu&s;e their
beneficial influence on the <HI>public,</HI> and render the go|vernment
as great and flouri&s;hing as they make indi|viduals
happy and pro&s;perous. The increa&s;e and
con&s;umption of all the commodities which &s;erve to
the ornament and plea&s;ure of life, are advantageous
to &s;ociety; becau&s;e at the &s;ame time that they mul|tiply
tho&s;e innocent gratifications to individuals, they
are a kind of <HI>&s;torehou&s;e</HI> of labour, which, in the exi|gencies
of &s;tate, may be turned to the public &s;ervice.
In a nation, where there is no demand for &s;uch &s;uper|fluities,
men &s;ink into indolence, lo&s;e all the enjoy|ment
of life, and are u&s;ele&s;s to the public, which can|not
maintain nor &s;upport its fleets and armies, from
the indu&s;try of &s;uch &s;lothful members.</P>
<P>THE bounds of all the EUROPEAN kingdoms are,
at pre&s;ent, pretty near the &s;ame they were two hun|dred
years ago: But what a difference is there in the
power and grandeur of tho&s;e kingdoms? Which can
be a&s;cribed to nothing but the increa&s;e of art and in|du&s;try.
When CHARLES VIII. of FRANCE invaded
ITALY, he carried with him about 20,000 men: And
yet this armament &s;o exhau&s;ted the nation, as we learn
from GUICCIARDIN, that for &s;ome years it was not

<P>THIS indu&s;try is much promoted by the knowledge

on the other hand, this knowledge enables the public

be carried to any degree of perfection, before hu|man

application to the more vulgar arts, at lea&s;t, of com|merce
and manufactures. Can we expect, that a go|vernment
will be well modelled by a people, who
know not how to make a &s;pinning-wheel, or to em|ploy
a loom to advantage? Not to mention, that all
ignorant ages are infe&s;ted with &s;uper&s;tition, which
throws the government off its bias, and di&s;turbs men
in the pur&s;uit of their intere&s;t and happine&s;s.</P>
<P>KNOWLEDGE in the arts of government naturally
begets mildne&s;s and moderation, by in&s;tructing men
in the advantages of humane maxims above rigour

off all hopes of pardon. When the tempers of
men are &s;oftened as well as their knowledge improv|ed,
this humanity appears &s;till more con&s;picuous, and
is the chief characteri&s;tic which di&s;tingui&s;hes a civili|zed
age from times of barbarity and ignorance. Fac|tions
are then le&s;s inveterate, revolutions le&s;s tragical,
authority le&s;s &s;evere, and &s;editions le&s;s frequent.
Even foreign wars abate of their cruelty; and after
the field of battle, where honour and intere&s;t &s;teel men
again&s;t compa&s;&s;ion as well as fear, the combatants di|ve&s;t
them&s;elves of the brute, and re&s;ume the man.</P>
<P>NOR need we fear, that men, by lo&s;ing their fero|city,
will lo&s;e their martial &s;pirit, or become le&s;s un|daunted
and vigorous in defence of their country or
their liberty. The arts have no &s;uch effect in ener|vating
either the mind or body. On the contrary, in|du&s;try,
their in&s;eparable attendant, adds new force to
both. And if anger, which is &s;aid to be the whet|&s;tone
of courage, lo&s;es &s;omewhat of its a&s;perity, by
politene&s;s and refinement; a &s;en&s;e of honour, which
is a &s;tronger, more con&s;tant, and more governable
principle, acquires fre&s;h vigour by that elevation of
genius, which ari&s;es from knowledge and a good edu|cation.
Add to this, that courage can neither have
any duration, nor be of any u&s;e, when not accompa|nied
with di&s;cipline and martial &s;kill, which are &s;el|dom
found among a barbarous people. The antients
remarked, that DATAMES was the only barbarian
<PB N="34" REF="37">
that ever knew the art of war. And PYRRHUS &s;ee|ing
the ROMANS mar&s;hal their army with &s;ome art and
&s;kill, &s;aid with &s;urprize, <HI>The&s;e barbarians have no|thing
barbarous in their di&s;cipline!</HI> 'Tis ob&s;ervable,
that as the old ROMANS, by applying them&s;elves
&s;olely to war, were the only civilized people that
ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed military di&s;cipline; &s;o the modern ITA|LIANS
are the only civilized people, among EURO|PEANS,
that ever wanted courage and a martial &s;pi|rit.
Tho&s;e who would a&s;cribe this effeminacy of the
ITALIANS to their luxury or politene&s;s, or appli|cation
to the arts, need but con&s;ider the FRENCH and
ENGLISH, who&s;e bravery is as unconte&s;table, as their
love for luxury, and their a&s;&s;iduity in commerce.
The ITALIAN hi&s;torians give us a more &s;atisfactory
rea&s;on for this degeneracy of their countrymen. They
&s;hew us how the &s;word was dropt at once by all the
ITALIAN &s;overeigns; while the VENETIAN ari&s;to|cracy
was jealous of its &s;ubjects, the FLORENTINE
democracy applied it&s;elf intirely to commerce; ROME
was governed by prie&s;ts, and NAPLES by women.
War then became the bu&s;ine&s;s of &s;oldiers of fortune,
who &s;pared one another, and, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of
the world, could engage a whole day in what they
called a battle, and return at night to their camp,
without the lea&s;t blood&s;hed.</P>
<P>WHAT has chiefly induced &s;evere morali&s;ts to de|claim
again&s;t refinement in the arts, is the example of
<PB N="35" REF="38">
antient ROME, which, joining to its poverty and ru&s;|ticity,
virtue and public &s;pirit, ro&s;e to &s;uch a &s;urpri|&s;ing
height of grandeur and liberty; but having
learned from its conquered provinces the ASIATIC
luxury, fell into every kind of corruption; whence
aro&s;e &s;edition and civil wars, attended at la&s;t with the
total lo&s;s of liberty. All the LATIN cla&s;&s;ics, whom
we peru&s;e in our infancy, are full of the&s;e &s;entiments,
and univer&s;ally a&s;cribe the ruin of their &s;tate to the
arts and riches imported from the Ea&s;t: In&s;omuch
that SALLUST repre&s;ents a ta&s;te for painting as a vice
no le&s;s than lewdne&s;s and drinking. And &s;o popular
were the&s;e &s;entiments, during the latter ages of the
republic, that this author abounds in prai&s;es of the
old rigid ROMAN virtue, tho' him&s;elf the mo&s;t egre|gious
in&s;tance of modern luxury and corruption;
&s;peaks contemptuou&s;ly of GRECIAN eloquence, tho'
the mo&s;t elegant writer in the world; nay, employs pre|po&s;terous
digre&s;&s;ions and declamations to this purpo&s;e,
tho' a model of ta&s;te and correctne&s;s.</P>
<P>BUT it would be ea&s;y to prove, that the&s;e writers
mi&s;took the cau&s;e of the di&s;orders in the ROMAN
&s;tate, and a&s;cribed to luxury and the arts, what real|ly
proceeded from an ill-modelled government, and
the unlimited extent of conque&s;ts. Refinement on
the plea&s;ures and conveniencies of life has no natural
tendency to beget venality and corruption. The va|lue
which all men put upon any particular plea&s;ure, de|pends
<PB N="36" REF="39">
on compari&s;on and experience; nor is a porter
le&s;s greedy of money, which he &s;pends on bacon and
brandy, than a courtier, who purcha&s;es champagne
and ortolans. Riches are valuable at all times, and to
all men, becau&s;e they always purcha&s;e plea&s;ures, &s;uch
as men are accu&s;tomed to, and de&s;ire: Nor can any
thing re&s;train or regulate the love of money, but a
&s;en&s;e of honour and virtue; which, if it be not near|ly
equal at all times, will naturally abound mo&s;t in
ages of knowledge and refinement.</P>
<P>OF all EUROPEAN kingdoms, POLAND &s;eems the
mo&s;t defective in the arts of war, as well as peace,
mechanical as well as liberal; and yet 'tis there that
venality and corruption do mo&s;t prevail. The nobles
&s;eem to have pre&s;erved their crown elective for no
other purpo&s;e, but regularly to &s;ell it to the highe&s;t
bidder. This is almo&s;t the only &s;pecies of commerce
with which that people are acquainted.</P>
<P>THE liberties of ENGLAND, &s;o far from decaying
&s;ince the improvements in the arts, have never flou|ri&s;hed
&s;o much as during that period. And tho' cor|ruption
may &s;eem to increa&s;e of late years; this is
chiefly to be a&s;cribed to our e&s;tabli&s;hed liberty, when
our princes have found the impo&s;&s;ibility of governing
without parliaments, or of terrifying parliaments by
the phantom of prerogative. Not to mention, that
this corruption or venality prevails infinitely more
<PB N="37" REF="40">
among the electors than the elected; and therefore
cannot ju&s;tly be a&s;cribed to any refinements in luxury.</P>
<P>IF we con&s;ider the matter in a proper light, we
&s;hall find, that improvements in the arts are rather
favourable to liberty, and have a natural tendency to
pre&s;erve, if not produce a free government. In rude
unpoli&s;hed nations, where the arts are neglected, all
the labour is be&s;towed on the cultivation of the
ground; and the whole &s;ociety divides into two
cla&s;&s;es, proprietors of land, and their va&s;&s;als or te|nants.
The latter are nece&s;&s;arily dependent, and fit|ted
for &s;lavery and &s;ubjection; e&s;pecially where they
po&s;&s;e&s;s no riches, and are not valued for their know|ledge
in agriculture; as mu&s;t always be the ca&s;e where
the arts are neglected. The former naturally erect
them&s;elves into petty tyrants; and mu&s;t either &s;ubmit
to an ab&s;olute ma&s;ter for the &s;ake of peace and order;
or if they will pre&s;erve their independency, like the
GOTHIC barons, they mu&s;t fall into feuds and conte&s;ts
among them&s;elves, and throw the whole &s;ociety into
&s;uch confu&s;ion, as is perhaps wor&s;e than the mo&s;t de|&s;potic
government. But where luxury nouri&s;hes com|merce
and indu&s;try, the pea&s;ants, by a proper culti|vation
of the land, become rich and independent;
while the trade&s;men and merchants acquire a &s;hare of
the property, and draw authority and con&s;ideration to
that middling rank of men, who are the be&s;t and
firme&s;t ba&s;is of public liberty. The&s;e &s;ubmit not to
<PB N="38" REF="41">
&s;lavery, like the poor pea&s;ants, from poverty and
meanne&s;s of &s;pirit; and having no hopes of tyranni|zing
over others, like the barons, they are not
tempted, for the &s;ake of that gratification, to &s;ubmit
to the tyranny of their &s;overeign. They covet equal
laws, which may &s;ecure their property, and pre&s;erve
them from monarchical, as well as ari&s;tocratical ty|ranny.</P>
<P>THE
hou&s;e of Commons is the &s;upport of our po|pular
government; and all the world acknowledge,
that it owed its chief influence and con&s;ideration to
the increa&s;e of commerce, which threw &s;uch a ba|lance
of property into the hands of the Commons.
How incon&s;i&s;tent then is it to blame &s;o violently a re|finement
in the arts, and to repre&s;ent it as the bane
of liberty and public &s;pirit!</P>
<P>To declaim again&s;t pre&s;ent times, and magnify
the virtue of remote ance&s;tors, is a propen&s;ity almo&s;t
inherent in human nature: And as the &s;entiments and
opinions of civilized ages alone are tran&s;mitted to po&s;|terity,
hence it is that we meet with &s;o many &s;evere
judgments pronounced again&s;t luxury, and even &s;ci|ence;
and hence it is that at pre&s;ent we give &s;o ready
an a&s;&s;ent to them. But the fallacy is ea&s;ily perceived
from comparing different nations that are contempo|raries;
where we both judge more impartially, and
can better &s;et in oppo&s;ition tho&s;e manners with which
<PB N="39" REF="42">
we are &s;ufficiently acquainted. Treachery and cu|elty,
the mo&s;t pernicious and mo&s;t odious of all vi|ces,
&s;eem peculiar to uncivilized ages; and by the re|fined
GREEKS and ROMANS were a&s;cribed to all the
barbarous nations, which &s;urrounded them. They
might ju&s;tly, therefore, have pre&s;umed, that their
own ance&s;tors, &s;o highly celebrated, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no
greater virtue, and were as much inferior to their
po&s;terity in honour and humanity, as in ta&s;te and &s;ci|ence.
An antient FRANK or SAXON may be highly
extolled: But I believe every man would think his
life or fortune much le&s;s &s;ecure in the hands of a
MOOR or TARTAR, than in tho&s;e of a FRENCH or
ENGLISH gentleman, the rank of men the mo&s;t civi|lized
in the mo&s;t civilized nations.</P>
<P>WE come now to the <HI>&s;econd</HI> po&s;ition which we pro|po&s;ed
to illu&s;trate, <HI>viz.</HI> that as innocent luxury, or a
refinement in the arts and conveniencies of life, is ad|vantageous
to the public; &s;o where-ever luxury cea|&s;es
to be innocent, it al&s;o cea&s;es to be beneficial; and
when carried a degree farther, begins to be a quality
pernicious, tho', perhaps, not the mo&s;t pernicious, to
political &s;ociety.</P>
<P>LET us con&s;ider what we call vicious luxury. No
gratification, however &s;en&s;ual, can of it&s;elf be e&s;teem|ed
vicious. A gratification is only vicious, when it en|gro&s;&s;es
all a man's expence, and leaves no ability for
<PB N="40" REF="43">
&s;uch acts of duty and genero&s;ity as are required by
his &s;ituation and fortune. Suppo&s;e, that he correct
the vice, and employ part of his expence in the edu|cation
of his children, in the &s;upport of his friends,
and in relieving the poor; would any prejudice re&s;ult
to &s;ociety? On the contrary, the &s;ame con&s;umption
would ari&s;e; and that labour, which, at pre&s;ent, is
employed only in producing a &s;lender gratification to
one man, would relieve the nece&s;&s;itous, and be&s;tow
&s;atisfaction on hundreds. The &s;ame care and toil
which rai&s;e a di&s;h of peas at CHRISTMAS, would
give bread to a whole family during &s;ix months. To
&s;ay, that, without a vicious luxury, the labour would
not have been employed at all, is only to &s;ay, that
there is &s;ome other defect in human nature, &s;uch as
indolence, &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, inattention to others, for which
luxury in &s;ome mea&s;ure provides a remedy; as one
poi&s;on may be an antidote to another. But virtue,
like whol&s;ome food, is better than poi&s;ons, however
corrected.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE the &s;ame number of men that are at pre|&s;ent
in BRITAIN, with the &s;ame &s;oil and climate; I
a&s;k, is it not po&s;&s;ible for them to be happier, by the
mo&s;t perfect way of life which can be imagined, and
by the greate&s;t reformation which Omnipotence it&s;elf
could work in their temper and di&s;po&s;ition? To a&s;|&s;ert,
that they cannot, appears evidently ridiculous.
As the land is able to maintain more than all its in|habitants,
<PB N="41" REF="44">
they could never, in &s;uch an UTOPIAN
&s;tate, feel any other ills than tho&s;e which ari&s;e from
bodily &s;ickne&s;s; and the&s;e are not the half of human
mi&s;eries. All other ills &s;pring from &s;ome vice, either
in our&s;elves or others; and even many of our di&s;ea&s;es
proceed from the &s;ame origin. Remove the vices,
and the ills follow. You mu&s;t only take care to re|move
all the vices. If you remove part, you may
render the matter wor&s;e. By bani&s;hing <HI>vicious</HI> luxu|ry,
without curing &s;loth and an indifference to others,
you only dimini&s;h indu&s;try in the &s;tate, and add no|thing
to mens charity or their genero&s;ity. Let us,
therefore, re&s;t contented with a&s;&s;erting, that two op|po&s;ite
vices in a &s;tate may be more advantageous than
either of them alone; but let us never pronounce vice
in it&s;elf advantageous. Is it not very incon&s;i&s;tent for
an author to a&s;&s;ert in one page, that moral di&s;tinctions
are inventions of politicians for public intere&s;t; and
in the next page maintain, that vice is advantageous
to the public<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Fable of the bees.</NOTE>? And indeed it &s;eems, upon any
&s;y&s;tem of morality, little le&s;s than a contradiction in
terms, to talk of a vice which is in general beneficial
to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>I THOUGHT this rea&s;oning nece&s;&s;ary, in order to
give &s;ome light to a philo&s;ophical que&s;tion, which
has been much di&s;puted in BRITAIN. I call it a
<HI>philo&s;ophical</HI> que&s;tion, not a <HI>political</HI> one. For what|ever
<PB N="42" REF="45">
may be the con&s;equence of &s;uch a miraculous
transformation of mankind, as would endow them
with every &s;pecies of virtue, and free them from
every &s;pecies of vice; this concerns not the magi&s;|trate,
who aims only at po&s;&s;ibilities. He cannot cure
every vice, by &s;ub&s;tituting a virtue in its place.
Very often he can only cure one vice by another; and
in that ca&s;e, he ought to prefer what is lea&s;t perni|cious
to &s;ociety. Luxury, when exce&s;&s;ive, is the
&s;ource of many ills; but is in general preferable to
&s;loth and idlene&s;s, which would commonly &s;ucceed
in its place, and are more pernicious both to private
per&s;ons and to the public. When &s;loth reigns, a
mean uncultivated way of life prevails among&s;t indi|viduals,
without &s;ociety, without enjoyment. And
if the &s;overeign, in &s;uch a &s;ituation, demands the
&s;ervice of his &s;ubjects, the labour of the &s;tate &s;uffices
only to furni&s;h the nece&s;&s;aries of life to the labourers,
and can afford nothing to tho&s;e who are employed in
the public &s;ervice.</P>

<HEAD>ESSAY III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of MONEY.</HEAD>
<P>MONEY is not, properly &s;peaking, one of the
&s;ubjects of commerce; but only the in&s;tru|ment
which men have agreed upon to facilitate the
exchange of one commodity for another. 'Tis none
of the wheels of trade: 'Tis the oil which renders
the motion of the wheels more &s;mooth and ea&s;y. If
we con&s;ider any one kingdom by it&s;elf, 'tis evident,
that the greater or le&s;s plenty of money is of no con|&s;equence;
&s;ince the prices of commodities are always
proportioned to the plenty of money, and a crown
in HARRY VII.'s time &s;erved the &s;ame purpo&s;e as a
pound does at pre&s;ent. 'Tis only the <HI>public</HI> which
draws any advantage from the greater plenty of mo|ney;
and that only in its wars and negotiations with
foreign &s;tates. And this is the rea&s;on, why all rich
and trading countries, from CARTHAGE to BRITAIN
and HOLLAND, have employed mercenary troops,
which they hired from their poorer neighbours. Were
they to make u&s;e of their native &s;ubjects, they would
<PB N="44" REF="47">
find le&s;s advantage from their &s;uperior riches, and
from their great plenty of gold and &s;ilver; &s;ince the
pay of all their &s;ervants mu&s;t ri&s;e in proportion to the
public opulence. Cur &s;mall army in BRITAIN of
20,000 men are maintained at as great expence as a
FRENCH army thrice as numerous. The ENGLISH
fleet, during the late war, required as much money
to &s;upport it as all the ROMAN legions, which kept
the whole world in &s;ubjection, during the time of the
emperors<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">A private &s;oldier in the ROMAN infantry had a denarius a-day, &s;omewhat le&s;s than eight pence. The ROMAN empe|rors had commonly 25 legions in pay, which, allowing 5000 men to a legion, makes 125,000. TACIT. <HI>Ann. lib.</HI> 4. 'Tis true, there were al&s;o auxiliaries to the legions; but their num|bers are uncertain, as well as their pay. To con&s;ider only the legionaries, the pay of the private men could not exceed 1,600,000 pound. Now, the parliament in the la&s;t war com|monly allowed for the fleet 2,500,000. We have therefore 900,000 over for the officers and other expences of the ROMAN legions. There &s;eem to have been but few officers in the ROMAN armies, in compari&s;on of what are employed in all our modern troops, except &s;ome SWISS corps. And the&s;e officers had very &s;mall pay: A centurion, for in&s;tance, only double a common &s;oldier. And as the &s;oldiers from their pay (TACIT. <HI>Ann. lib.</HI> 1.) bought their own cloaths, arms, tents, and baggage; this mu&s;t al&s;o dimini&s;h con&s;iderably the other charges of the army. So little expen&s;ive was that mighty government, and &s;o ea&s;y was its yoke over the world. And, indeed, this is the more natural conclu&s;ion from the foregoing calculations.

<P><PB N="45" REF="48">
THE greater number of people and their greater
indu&s;try are &s;erviceable in all ca&s;es; at home and a|broad,
in private, and in public. But the greater
plenty of money is very limited in its u&s;e, and may
even &s;ometimes be a lo&s;s to a nation in its commerce
with foreigners.</P>
<P>THERE &s;eems to be a happy concurrence of cau&s;es
in human affairs, which check the growth of trade
and riches, and hinder them from being confined in|tirely
to one people; as might naturally at fir&s;t be
dreaded from the advantages of an e&s;tabli&s;hed com|merce.
Where one nation has got the &s;tart of ano|ther
in trade, 'tis very difficult for the latter to regain
the ground it has lo&s;t; becau&s;e of the &s;uperior indu&s;|try
and &s;kill of the former, and the greater &s;tocks, of
which its merchants are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and which enable
them to trade for &s;o much &s;maller profits. But the&s;e
advantages are compen&s;ated, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, by the
low price of labour in every nation which has not an
exten&s;ive commerce, and does not very much abound
in gold and &s;ilver. Manufactures, therefore, gradu|ally
&s;hift their places, leaving tho&s;e countries and pro|vinces
which they have already inriched, and flying
to others, whither they are allured by the cheapne&s;s
<PB N="46" REF="49">
of provi&s;ions and labour; till they have inriched the&s;e
al&s;o, and are again bani&s;hed by the &s;ame cau&s;es. And,
in general, we may ob&s;erve, that the dearne&s;s of
every thing, from plenty of money, is a di&s;advan|tage,
which attends an e&s;tabli&s;hed commerce, and &s;ets
bounds to it in every country, by enabling the poorer
&s;tates to under&s;el the richer in all foreign markets.</P>
<P>THIS has made me entertain a great doubt concer|ning
the benefit of <HI>banks</HI> and <HI>paper-credit,</HI> which are
&s;o generally e&s;teemed advantageous to every nation.
That provi&s;ions and labour &s;hould become dear by the
increa&s;e of trade and money, is, in many re&s;pects, an
inconvenience; but an inconvenience that is unavoid|able,
and the effect of that public wealth and pro&s;pe|rity
which are the end of all our wi&s;hes. 'Tis com|pen&s;ated
by the advantages which we reap, from the
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the&s;e precious metals, and the weight
which they give the nation in all foreign wars and ne|gotiations.
But there appears no rea&s;on for increa&s;|ing
that inconvenience by a counterfeit money, which
foreigners will not accept in any payment, and which
any great di&s;order in the &s;tate will reduce to nothing.
There are, 'tis true, many people in every rich &s;tate,
who, having large &s;ums of money, would prefer pa|per
with good &s;ecurity; as being of more ea&s;y tran&s;|port
and more &s;afe cu&s;tody. If the public provide
not a bank, private bankers will take advantage of
this circum&s;tance; as the gold&s;miths formerly did
<PB N="47" REF="50">
in LONDON, or as the bankers do at pre&s;ent in DUB|LIN:
And therefore 'tis better, it may be thought,
that a public company &s;hould enjoy the benefit of
that paper-credit, which always will have place in
every opulent kingdom. But to endeavour artificial|ly
to increa&s;e &s;uch a credit, can never be the intere&s;t
of any trading nation; but mu&s;t lay them under di&s;|advantages,
by increa&s;ing money beyond its natural
proportion to labour and commodities, and thereby
heightening their price to the merchant and manufac|turer.
And in this view, it mu&s;t be allowed, that
no bank could be more advantageous than &s;uch a one
as locked up all the money it received<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This is the ca&s;e with the bank of AMSTERDAM.</NOTE>, and never
augmented the circulating coin, as is u&s;ual, by re|turning
part of its trea&s;ure into commerce. A pub|lic
bank, by this expedient, might cut off much of
the dealings of private bankers and money-jobbers;
and tho' the &s;tate bore the charge of &s;alaries to the di|rectors
and tellers of this bank, (for, according to
the preceding &s;uppo&s;ition, it would have no profit
from its dealings), the national advantage, re&s;ulting
from the low price of labour and the de&s;truction of
paper-credit, would be a &s;ufficient compen&s;ation.
Not to mention, that &s;o large a &s;um, lying ready at
command, would be a great convenience in times of
public danger and di&s;tre&s;s; and what part of it was
<PB N="48" REF="51">
u&s;ed might be replaced at lei&s;ure, when peace and
tranquillity were re&s;tored to the nation.</P>
<P>BUT of this &s;ubject of paper-credit we &s;hall treat
more largely hereafter. And I &s;hall fini&s;h this e&s;&s;ay
on money, by propo&s;ing and explaining two ob&s;er|vations,
which may, perhaps, &s;erve to employ the
thoughts of our &s;peculative politicians. For the the&s;e
only I all along addre&s;s my&s;elf. 'Tis enough, that I
&s;ubmit to the ridicule &s;ometimes, in this age, attach|ed
to the character of a philo&s;opher, without adding
to it that which belongs to a projector.</P>
<P>IT was a &s;hrewd ob&s;ervation of ANACHARSIS<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">PLUT. <HI>Quomodo quis &s;uos profectus in virtute &s;entire po&s;&s;it.</HI></NOTE> the
SCYTHIAN, who had neve &s;een money in his own
country, that gold and &s;ilver &s;eemed to him of no u&s;e
to the GREEKS, but to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in numeration and
arithmetic. 'Tis indeed evident, that money is no|thing
but the repre&s;entation of labour and commodi|ties,
and &s;erves only as a method of rating or e&s;ti|mating
them. Where coin is in greater plenty; as a
greater quantity of it is required to repre&s;ent the &s;ame
quantity of goods; it can have no effect, either good
or bad, taking a nation within it&s;elf; no more than
it would make any alteration on a merchant's books,
if, in&s;tead of the ARABIAN method of notation,
which requires few characters, he &s;hould make u&s;e of
<PB N="47" REF="52">
the ROMAN, which requires a great many. Nay, the
greater quantity of money, like the ROMAN charac|ters,
is rather inconvenient, and requires greater trou|ble
both to keep and tran&s;port it. But notwith&s;tand|ing
this conclu&s;ion, which mu&s;t be allowed ju&s;t, 'tis
certain, that, &s;ince the di&s;covery of the mines in
AMERICA, indu&s;try has increa&s;ed in all the nations
of EUROPE, except in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of tho&s;e mines;
and this may ju&s;tly be a&s;cribed, among&s;t other rea|&s;ons,
to the increa&s;e of gold and &s;ilver. According|ly
we find, that in every kingdom, into which money
begins to flow in greater abundance than formerly,
every thing takes a new face; labour and indu&s;try
gain life; the merchant becomes more enterpri&s;ing,
the manufacturer-more diligent and &s;kilful, and even
the farmer follows his plough with greater alacrity
and attention. This is not ea&s;ily to be accounted
for, if we con&s;ider only the influence which a greater
abundance of coin has in the kingdom it&s;elf, by
heightening the price of commodities, and obliging
every one to pay a greater number of the&s;e little yel|low
or white pieces for every thing he purcha&s;es.
And as to foreign trade, it appears, that great plenty
of money is rather di&s;advantageous, by rai&s;ing the
price of every kind of labour.</P>
<P>To account, then, for this phaenomenon, we mu&s;t
con&s;ider, that tho' the high price of commodities be
a nece&s;&s;ary con&s;equence of the increa&s;e of gold and
<PB N="50" REF="53">
&s;ilver, yet it follows not immediately upon that in|crea&s;e;
but &s;ome time is required before the money
circulate thro' the whole &s;tate, and make its effects be
felt on all ranks of people. At fir&s;t, no alteration is
perceived; by degrees, the price ri&s;es, fir&s;t of one
commodity, then of another; till the whole at la&s;t
reaches a ju&s;t proportion with the new quantity of &s;pe|cie
which is in the kingdom. In my opinion, 'tis
only in this interval or intermediate &s;ituation, between
the acqui&s;ition of money and ri&s;e of prices, that the in|crea&s;ing
quantity of gold and &s;ilver is favourable to
indu&s;try. When any quantity of money is imported
into a nation, it is not at fir&s;t di&s;per&s;ed into many
hands; but is confined to the coffers of a few per&s;ons,
who immediately &s;eek to employ it to the be&s;t advan|tage.
Here are a &s;et of manufacturers or merchants,
we &s;hall &s;uppo&s;e, who have received returns of gold
and &s;ilver for goods which they &s;ent to CADIZ. They
are thereby enabled to employ more workmen than
formerly, who never dream of demanding higher
wages, but are glad of employment from &s;uch good
payma&s;ters. If workmen become &s;carce, the manu|facturer
gives higher wages, but at fir&s;t requires an in|crea&s;e
of labour; and this is willingly &s;ubmitted to
by the arti&s;an, who can now eat and drink better, to
compen&s;ate his additional toil and fatigue. He car|ries
his money to market, where he finds every thi$g
at the &s;ame price as formerly, but returns with great|er
quantity and of better kinds, for the u&s;e of his
<PB N="51" REF="54">
family. The farmer and gardener, finding, that all
their commodities are taken off, apply them&s;elves
with alacrity to the rai&s;ing more; and at the &s;ame
time can afford to take better and more cloths from
their trade&s;men, who&s;e price is the &s;ame as formerly,
and their indu&s;try only whetted by &s;o much new gain.
'Tis ea&s;y to trace the money in its progre&s;s thro' the
whole commonwealth; where we &s;hall find, that it
mu&s;t fir&s;t quicken the diligence of every individual,
before it increa&s;e the price of labour.</P>
<P>AND that the &s;pecie may increa&s;e to a con&s;iderable
pitch, before it have this latter effect, appears, a|mong&s;t
other in&s;tances, from the frequent operations
of the FRENCH king on the money; where it was
always found, that the augmenting the numerary va|lue
did not produce a proportional ri&s;e of the prices,
at lea&s;t for &s;ome time. In the la&s;t year of LOUIS XIV,
money was rai&s;ed three &s;evenths, but prices augment|ed
only one. Corn in FRANCE is now &s;old at the
&s;ame price, or for the &s;ame number of livres it was
in 1683' tho' &s;ilver was then at 30 livres the mark,
and is now at 50<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>The&s;e facts I give upon the authority of Mon&s;. du TOT in his <HI>Reflexions politiques,</HI> an author of reputation. Tho' I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that the facts which he advances on other occa&s;ions, are often &s;o &s;u&s;picious, as to make his authority le&s;s in this matter. However, the general ob&s;ervation, that the augmenting the money in FRANCE does not at fir&s;t proportionably augment the prices, is certainly ju&s;t.</P>
<P>By the by, this &s;eems to be one of the be&s;t rea&s;ons which can be given, for a gradual and univer&s;al augmentation of the mo|ney, tho' it has been intirely overlooked in all tho&s;e volumes which have been wrote on that que&s;tion by MELON, du TOT, and PARIS de VERNEY. Were all our money, for in&s;tance, recoined, and a penny's worth of &s;ilver taken from every &s;hil|ling, the new &s;hilling would probably purcha&s;e every thing that could have been bought by the old; the prices of every thing would thereby be in&s;en&s;bly dimini&s;hed; foreign trade enlivened; and dome&s;tic indu&s;try, by the circulation of a greater number of pounds and &s;hillings, would receive &s;ome increa&s;e and encourage|ment. In executing &s;uch a project, 'twould be better to make the new &s;hilling pa&s;s for 24 half-pence, in order to pre&s;erve the illu&s;ion, and make it be taken for the &s;ame. And as a recoin|age of our &s;ilver begins to be requi&s;ite, by the continual wearing of our &s;hillings and &s;ixpences, it may be doubtful, whether we ought to imitate the example in King WILLIAM's reign, when the clipt money was rai&s;ed to the old &s;tandard.</P></NOTE>. Not to mention the great addi|tion
<PB N="52" REF="55">
of gold and &s;ilver, which may have come into
that kingdom &s;ince the former period.</P>
<P>FROM the whole of this rea&s;oning we may conclude,
that 'tis of no manner of con&s;equence, with regard to
the dome&s;tic happine&s;s of a &s;tate, whether money be
in a greater or le&s;s quantity. The good policy of the
magi&s;trate con&s;i&s;ts only in keeping it, if po&s;&s;ible, &s;till
increa&s;ing; becau&s;e, by that means, he keeps alive a
&s;pirit of indu&s;try in the nation, and increa&s;es the
<PB N="53" REF="56">
&s;tock of labour, in which con&s;i&s;ts all real power and
riches. A nation who&s;e money decrea&s;es, is actually,
at that time, much weaker and more mi&s;erable than
another nation, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es no more money, but is
on the increa&s;ing hand. This will be ea&s;ily account|ed
for, if we con&s;ider, that the alterations in the
quantity of money, either on the one &s;ide or the o|ther,
are not immediately attended with proportion|able
alterations in the prices of commodities. There
is always an interval before matters be adju&s;ted to
their new &s;ituation; and this interval is as pernicious
to indu&s;try when gold and &s;ilver are dimini&s;hing, as it
is advantageous when the&s;e metals are increa&s;ing.
The workman has not the &s;ame employment from the
manufacturer and merchant; tho' he pays the &s;ame
price for every thing in the market. The farmer
cannot di&s;po&s;e of his corn and cattle; tho' he mu&s;t
pay the &s;ame rent to his landlord. The poverty, and
beggary, and &s;loth, which mu&s;t en&s;ue, are ea&s;ily
fore&s;een.</P>
<P>II. THE &s;econd ob&s;ervation which I propo&s;ed to
make with regard to money, may be explained after
the following manner. There are &s;ome kingdoms,
and many provinces in EUROPE, (and all of them
were once in the &s;ame condition) where money is &s;o
&s;carce, that the landlord can get none at all from his
tenants; but is obliged to take his rent in kind, and
either to con&s;ume it him&s;elf, or tran&s;port it to places
<PB N="54" REF="57">
where he may find a market. In tho&s;e countries, the
prince can levy few or no taxes, but in the &s;ame
manner: And as he will receive very &s;mall benefit
from impo&s;itions &s;o paid, 'tis evident that &s;uch a
kingdom has very little force even at home; and can|not
maintain fleets and armies to the &s;ame extent, as
if every part of it abounded in gold and &s;ilver. There
is &s;urely a greater di&s;proportion betwixt the force of
GERMANY at pre&s;ent and what it was three centuries
ago<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">The ITALIANS gave to the emperor MAXIMILIAN, the nick-name of POCCI-DANARI. None of the enterpri&s;es of that prince ever &s;ucceeded, for want of money.</NOTE>, than there is in its indu&s;try, people, and ma|nufactures.
The AUSTRIAN dominions in the em|pire
are in general well peopled and well cultivated,
and are of great extent; but have not a proportion|able
weight in the balance of EUROPE; proceeding,
as is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed, from the &s;carcity of money.
How do all the&s;e facts agree with that principle of
rea&s;on, that the quantity of gold and &s;ilver is in it&s;elf
altogether indifferent? According to that principle,
where ever a &s;overeign has numbers of &s;ubjects, and
the&s;e have plenty of commodities, he &s;hould of cour&s;e
be great and powerful, and they rich and happy, in|dependent
of the greater or le&s;&s;er abundance of the
precious metals. The&s;e admit of divi&s;ions and &s;ub|divi&s;ions
to a great extent; and where they would be|come
<PB N="55" REF="58">
&s;o &s;mall as to be in danger of being lo&s;t, 'tis
ea&s;y to mix them with a ba&s;er metal, as is practi&s;ed in
&s;ome countries of EUROPE; and by that means rai&s;e
them to a bulk more &s;en&s;ible and convenient. They
&s;till &s;erve the &s;ame purpo&s;es of exchange, whatever
their number may be, or whatever colour they may be
&s;uppo&s;ed to have.</P>
<P>TO The&s;e difficulties I an&s;wer, that the effect here
&s;uppo&s;ed to flow from &s;carcity of money, really ari&s;es
from the manners and cu&s;toms of the inhabitants;
and that we mi&s;take, as is too u&s;ual, a collateral ef|fect
for a cau&s;e. The contradiction is only apparent;
but it requires &s;ome thought and reflection to di&s;cover
the principles by which we can reconcile <HI>rea&s;on</HI> to <HI>ex|perience.</HI></P>
<P>IT
&s;eems a maxim almo&s;t &s;elf-evident, that the pri|ces
of every thing depend on the proportion between
commodities and money, and that any con&s;iderable
alteration on either of the&s;e has the &s;ame effect, either
of heightening or lowering the prices. Increa&s;e the
commodities, they become cheaper; increa&s;e the
money, they ri&s;e in their value. As, on the other
hand, a diminution of the former, and that of the
latter, have contrary tendencies.</P>
<P>'TIS al&s;o evident, that the prices do not &s;o much
depend on the ab&s;olute quantity of commodities and
<PB N="56" REF="59">
that of money, which are in a nation, as on that of
the commodities, which come or may come to mar|ket,
and of the money which circulates. If the coin
be locked up in che&s;ts, 'tis the &s;ame thing with re|gard
to prices, as if it were annihilated: If the com|modities
be hoarded in granaries, a like effect fol|lows.
As the money and commodities, in the&s;e ca|&s;es,
never meet, they cannot affect each other. Were
we, at any time, to form conjectures concerning the
price of provi&s;ions, the corn which the farmer mu&s;t
re&s;erve for the maintenance of him&s;elf and family,
ought never to enter into the e&s;timation. 'Tis only
the overplus, compared to the demand, that deter|mines
the value.</P>
<P>TO apply the&s;e principles, we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that
in the fir&s;t and more uncultivated ages of any &s;tate,
ere fancy has confounded her wants with tho&s;e of na|ture,
men, contented with the productions of their
own fields, or with tho&s;e rude preparations which
they them&s;elves can work upon them, have little oc|ca&s;ion
for exchange, or at lea&s;t for money, which, by
agreement, is the common mea&s;ure of exchange.
The wool of the farmer's own flock, &s;pun in his own
family, and wrought by a neighbouring weaver, who
receives his payment in corn or wool, &s;uffices for fur|niture
and cloathing. The carpenter, the &s;mith, the
ma&s;on, the tailor, are retained by wages of a like
nature; and the landlord him&s;elf, dwelling in the
<PB N="57" REF="60">
neighbourhood, is contented to receive his rent in the
commodities rai&s;ed by the farmer. The greate&s;t part
of the&s;e he con&s;umes at home, in ru&s;tic ho&s;pitality:
The re&s;t, perhaps, he di&s;po&s;es of for money to the
neighbouring town, whence he draws the few mate|rials
of his expence and luxury.</P>
<P>BUT after men begin to refine on all the&s;e enjoy|ments,
and live not always at home, nor are content|ed
with what can be rai&s;ed in their neighbourhood,
there is more exchange and commerce of all kinds,
and more money enters into that exchange. The
trade&s;men will not be paid in corn; becau&s;e they
want &s;omething more than barely to eat. The farmer
goes beyond his own pari&s;h for the commodities he
purcha&s;es, and cannot always carry his commodities
to the merchant who &s;upplies him. The landlord
lives in the capital, or in a foreign country; and de|mands
his rent in gold and &s;ilver, which can ea&s;ily be
tran&s;ported to him. Great undertakers, and manu|facturers,
and merchants, ari&s;e in every commodity;
and the&s;e can conveniently deal in nothing but in
&s;pecie. And con&s;equently, in this &s;ituation of &s;oci|ety,
the coin enters into many more contracts, and
by that means is much more employed than in the
former.</P>
<P>THE nece&s;&s;ary effect is, that, provided the money
does not increa&s;e in the nation, every thing mu&s;t be|come
<PB N="58" REF="61">
much cheaper in times of indu&s;try and refine|ment,
than in rude, uncultivated ages. 'Tis the pro|portion
between the circulating money, and the com|modities
in the market, which determines the prices.
Goods that are con&s;umed at home, or exchanged with
other goods in the neighbourhood, never come to
market; they affect not in the lea&s;t the current &s;pecie;
with regard to it they are as if totally annihilated;
and con&s;equently this method of u&s;ing them &s;inks the
proportion on the &s;ide of the commodities, and in|crea&s;es
the prices. But after money enters into all
contracts and &s;ales, and is every where the mea&s;ure of
exchange, the &s;ame national ca&s;h has a much greater
ta&s;k to perform; all commodities are then in the
market; the &s;phere of circulation is enlarged; 'tis
the &s;ame ca&s;e as if that individual &s;um were to &s;erve a
larger kingdom; and therefore, the proportion being
here le&s;&s;ened on the &s;ide of the money, every thing
mu&s;t become cheaper, and the prices gradually fall.</P>
<P>BY the mo&s;t exact computations that have been
formed all over EUROPE, after making allowance for
the alteration in the numerary value or the denomi|nation,
'tis found, that the prices of all things have
only ri&s;en three, or at mo&s;t, four times, &s;ince the di&s;|covery
of the WEST INDIES. But will any one a&s;|&s;ert,
that there is not four times the coin in EUROPE,
that was in the fifteenth century, and the centuries
preceding it? The SPANIARDS and PORTUGUESE
<PB N="59" REF="62">
from their mines, the ENGLISH, FRENCH, and
DUTCH, by their AFRICAN trade, and by their inter-lopers
in the WEST INDIES, bring home about &s;ix
millions a-year, of which not above a third part goes
to the EAST INDIES. This &s;um alone in ten years
would probably double the antient &s;tock of money in
EUROPE. And no other &s;atisfactory rea&s;on can be
given, why all prices have not ri&s;en to a much more
exorbitant height, except that derived from a change
of cu&s;toms and manners. Be&s;ides that more commo|dities
are produced by additional indu&s;try, the &s;ame
commodities come more to market, after men depart
from their antient &s;implicity of manners. And tho'
this increa&s;e has not been equal to that of money, it
has, however, been con&s;iderable, and has pre&s;erved
the proportion between coin and commodities nearer
the antient &s;tandard.</P>
<P>WERE the que&s;tion propo&s;ed, Which of the&s;e me|thods
of living in the people, the &s;imple or the refi|ned,
is the mo&s;t advantageous to the &s;tate or public?
I &s;hould, without much &s;cruple, prefer the latter, in a
view to politics at lea&s;t; and &s;hould produce this as
an additional rea&s;on for the encouragement of trade
and manufactures.</P>
<P>WHEN men live in the antient &s;imple manner, and
&s;upply all their nece&s;&s;aries from dome&s;tic indu&s;try or
from the neighbourhood, the &s;overeign can levy no
<PB N="60" REF="63">
taxes in money from a con&s;iderable part of his &s;ub|jects;
and if he will impo&s;e on them any burdens, he
mu&s;t take his payment in commodities, with which
alone they abound; a method attended with &s;uch
great and obvious inconveniencies, that they need
not here be in&s;i&s;ted on. All the money he can pre|tend
to rai&s;e, mu&s;t be from his principal cities, where
alone it circulates; and the&s;e, 'tis evident, cannot af|ford
him &s;o much as the whole &s;tate could, did gold
and &s;ilver circulate thro' the whole. But be&s;ides this
obvious diminution of the revenue, there is al&s;o ano|ther
cau&s;e of the poverty of the public in &s;uch a &s;itu|ation.
Not only the &s;overeign receives le&s;s money,
but the &s;ame money goes not &s;o far as in times of in|du&s;try
and general commerce. Every thing is dearer,
where the gold and &s;ilver are &s;uppo&s;ed equal; and
that becau&s;e fewer commodities come to market, and
the whole coin bears a higher proportion to what is to
be purcha&s;ed by it; whence alone the prices of every
thing are fixed and determined.</P>
<P>HERE then we may learn the fallacy of the remark,
often to be met with in hi&s;torians, and even in com|mon
conver&s;ation, that any particular &s;tate is weak,
tho' fertile, populous, and well cultivated, merely be|cau&s;e
it wants money. It appears, that the want of
money can never injure any &s;tate within it&s;elf: For
men and commodities are the real &s;trength of any
community. 'Tis the &s;imple manner of living which
<PB N="61" REF="64">
here hurts the public, by confining the gold and &s;ilver
to few hands, and preventing its univer&s;al diffu&s;ion
and circulation. On the contrary, indu&s;try and re|finements
of all kinds incorporate it with the whole
&s;tate, however &s;mall its quantity may be: They di|ge&s;t
it into every vein, &s;o to &s;peak; and make it en|ter
into every tran&s;action and contract. No hand is
intirely empty of it. And as the prices of every
thing fall by that means, the &s;overeign has a double
advantage: He may draw money by his taxes from
every part of the &s;tate; and what he receives, goes
farther in every purcha&s;e and payment.</P>
<P>WE may infer, from a compari&s;on of prices, that
money is not more plentiful in CHINA, than it was in
EUROPE three centuries ago: But what immen&s;e
power is that empire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, if we may judge by
the civil and military li&s;t maintained by it? POLYBIUS
<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib&punc; 2. cap. 15&punc;</NOTE> tells us, that provi&s;ions were &s;o cheap in ITALY
during his time, that in &s;ome places the &s;tated club in
the inns was a <HI>&s;emis</HI> a-head, little more than a far|thing?
Yet the ROMAN power had even then &s;ub|dued
the whole known world. About a century be|fore
that period, the CARTHAGINIAN amba&s;&s;ador
&s;aid, by way of raillery, that no people lived more
&s;ociably among&s;t them&s;elves than the ROMANS; for
that in every entertainment, which, as foreign mini&s;|ters,
they received, they &s;till ob&s;erved the &s;ame plate
<PB N="62" REF="65">
at every table<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">PLIN. lib. 33. cap. 11.</NOTE>. The ab&s;olute quantity of the pre|cious
metals is a matter of great indifference. There
are only two circum&s;tances of any importance, <HI>viz.</HI>
their gradual increa&s;e, and their thorough concoction
and circulation thro' the &s;tate; and the influence of
both the&s;e circum&s;tances has been here explained.</P>
<P>IN the following E&s;&s;ay we &s;hall &s;ee an in&s;tance of a

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of INTEREST.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING is e&s;teemed a more certain &s;ign of
the flouri&s;hing condition of any nation than
the lowne&s;s of intere&s;t: And with rea&s;on; tho' I be|lieve
the cau&s;e is &s;omewhat different from what is com|monly
apprehended. The lowne&s;s of intere&s;t is ge|nerally
a&s;cribed to the plenty of money. But money,
however plentiful, has no other effect, <HI>if fixed,</HI> than
to rai&s;e the price of labour. Silver is more common
than gold; and therefore you receive a greater quan|tity
of it for the &s;ame commodities. But do you pay
le&s;s intere&s;t for it? Intere&s;t in BATAVIA and JAMAICA
is at 10 <HI>per cent.</HI> in PORTUGAL at 6; tho' the&s;e
places, as we may learn from the prices of every thing,
abound much more in gold and &s;ilver than either
LONDON or AMSTERDAM.</P>
<P>WERE all the gold in ENGLAND annihilated at once,
and one and twenty &s;hillings &s;ub&s;tituted in the place
of every guinea, would money be more plentiful or
<PB N="64" REF="67">
intere&s;t lower? No &s;urely: We &s;hould only u&s;e &s;ilver
in&s;tead of gold. Were gold rendered as common as
&s;ilver, and &s;ilver as common as copper; would money
be more plentiful or intere&s;t lower? We may a&s;&s;uredly
give the &s;ame an&s;wer. Our &s;hillings would then be
yellow, and our halfpence white; and we &s;hould have
no guineas. No other difference would ever be ob|&s;erved;
no alteration on commerce, manufactures,
navigation, or intere&s;t; unle&s;s we imagine, that the
colour of the metal is of any con&s;equence.</P>
<P>NOW, what is &s;o vi&s;ible in the&s;e greater variations
of &s;carcity or abundance of the precious metals, mu&s;t
hold in all inferior changes. If the multiplying gold
and &s;ilver fifteen times makes no difference, much le&s;s
can the doubling or tripling them. All augmentation
has no other effect than to heighten the price of la|bour
and commodities; and even this variation is
little more than that of a name. In the progre&s;s to|wards
the&s;e changes, the augmentation may have &s;ome
influence, by exciting indu&s;try; but after the prices
are &s;ettled, &s;uitable to the new abundance of gold and
&s;ilver, it has no manner of influence.</P>
<P>AN effect always holds proportion with its cau&s;e.
Prices have ri&s;en about four times &s;ince the di&s;covery
of the INDIES; and 'tis probable gold and &s;ilver have
multiplied much more: But intere&s;t has not fallen
much above half. The rate of intere&s;t, therefore,
<PB N="65" REF="68">
is not derived from the quantity of the precious
metals.</P>
<P>MONEY having merely a $ictitious value, ari&s;ing
from the agreement and convention of men, the
greater or le&s;s plenty of it is of no con&s;equence, if
we con&s;ider a nation within it&s;elf; and the quantity
of &s;pecie, when once fixed, tho' never &s;o large, has
no other effect, than to oblige every one to tell out a
greater number of tho&s;e &s;hining bits of metal, for
cloaths, furniture, or equipage, without increa&s;ing
any one convenience of life. If a man borrows
money to build a hou&s;e, he then carries home a
greater load; becau&s;e the &s;tone, timber, lead, gla&s;s,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> with the labour of the ma&s;ons and carpenters,
are repre&s;ented by a greater quantity of gold and
&s;ilver. But as the&s;e metals are con&s;idered merely as
repre&s;entations, there can no alteration ari&s;e, from
their bulk or quantity, their weight or colour, either
upon their real value or their intere&s;t. The &s;ame
intere&s;t, in all ca&s;es, bears the &s;ame proportion to the
&s;um. And if you lent me &s;o much labour and &s;o
many commodities; by receiving five <HI>per cent.</HI> you re|ceive
always proportional labour and commodities,
however repre&s;ented, whether by yellow or white
coin, whether by a pound or an ounce. 'Tis in vain,
therefore, to look for the cau&s;e of the fall or ri&s;e of
intere&s;t in the greater or le&s;s quantity of gold and
&s;ilver, which is fixed in any nation.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="69">
HIGH intere&s;t ari&s;es from <HI>three</HI> circum&s;tances: A
great demand for borrowing; little riches to &s;upply
that demand; and great profits ari&s;ing from commerce.
And the&s;e circum&s;tances are a clear proof of the &s;mall
advance of commerce and indu&s;try, not of the &s;car|city
of gold and &s;ilver. Low intere&s;t, on the other
hand, proceeds from the three oppo&s;ite circum&s;tances:
A &s;mall demand for borrowing; great riches to &s;up|ply
that demand; and &s;mall profits ari&s;ing from com|merce.
And the&s;e circum&s;tances are all connected to|gether,
and proceed from the increa&s;e of indu&s;try and
commerce, not of gold and &s;ilver. We &s;hall endea|vour
to prove the&s;e points as fully and di&s;tinctly as
po&s;&s;ible; and &s;hall begin with the cau&s;es and the ef|fects
of a great or &s;mall demand for borrowing.</P>
<P>WHEN a people have emerged ever &s;o little from
a &s;avage &s;tate, and their numbers have increa&s;ed be|yond
the original multitude, there mu&s;t immediately
ari&s;e an inequality of property; and while &s;ome po&s;|&s;e&s;s,
large tracts of land, others are confined within
narrow limits, and &s;ome are entirely without any
landed property. Tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s more land
than they can labour, employ tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s none,
and agree to receive a determinate part of the pro|duct.
Thus the <HI>landed</HI> intere&s;t is immediately e&s;ta|bli&s;hed;
nor is there any &s;ettled government, how|ever
rude, in which affairs are not on this footing.
Of the&s;e proprietors of land, &s;ome mu&s;t pre&s;ently di&s;|cover
<PB N="67" REF="70">
them&s;elves to be of different tempers from
others; and while one would willingly &s;tore up the
product of his land for futurity, another de&s;ires to con|&s;ume
at pre&s;ent what &s;hould &s;uffice for many years.
But as the &s;pending a &s;ettled revenue is a way of life
entirely without occupation; men have &s;o much need
of &s;omewhat to fix and engage them, that plea&s;ures'
&s;uch as they are, will be the pur&s;uit of the greate&s;t
part of the landholders, and the prodigals among&s;t
them will always be more numerous than the mi&s;ers.
In a &s;tate, therefore, where there is nothing but a
landed intere&s;t, as there is little frugality, the bor|rowers
may be very numerous, and the rate of intere&s;t
mu&s;t hold proportion to it. The difference depends
not on the quantity of money, but on the habits and
manners which prevail. By this alone the demand
for borrowing is increa&s;ed or dimini&s;hed. Were mo|ney
&s;o plentiful as to make an egg be &s;old for &s;ix-pence;
&s;o long as there are only landed gentry and
pea&s;ants in the &s;tate, the borrowers mu&s;t be numerous,
and intere&s;t high. The rent for the &s;ame farm would
be heavier and more bulky: But the &s;ame idlene&s;s of
the landlord, with the higher prices of commodities,
would di&s;&s;ipate it in the &s;ame time, and produce the
&s;ame nece&s;&s;ity and demand for borrowing<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">I have been informed by a very eminent lawyer, and a man of great knowlege and ob&s;ervation, that it appears from antient papers and records, that, about four centuries ago, money, in SCOTLAND, and probably in other parts of EUROPE, was only at five <HI>per cent.</HI> and afterwards ro&s;e to ten before the di&s;covery of the WEST-INDIES. This fact is curious; but might ea&s;ily be reconciled to the foregoing rea&s;oning. Men, in that age, lived &s;o much at home, and in &s;o very &s;imple and frugal a manner, that they had no occa&s;ion for money; and tho' the lenders were then few, the borrowers were &s;till fewer. The high rate of in|tere&s;t among the early ROMANS is accounted for by hi&s;torians from the frequent lo&s;&s;es &s;u&s;tained by the inroads of the enemy.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="68" REF="71">
NOR is the ca&s;e different with regard to the <HI>&s;econd</HI>
circum&s;tance which we propo&s;ed to con&s;ider, <HI>viz.</HI> the
great or little riches to &s;upply this demand. This
effect al&s;o depends on the habits and ways of living
of the people, not on the quantity of gold and &s;ilver.
In order to have, in any &s;tate, a great number of
lenders, 'tis not &s;ufficient nor requi&s;ite that there be
great abundance of precious metals. 'Tis only requi|&s;ite
that the property or command of that quantity,
which is in the &s;tate, whether great or &s;mall, &s;hould
be collected in particular hands, &s;o as to form con&s;i|derable
&s;ums, or compo&s;e a great monied intere&s;t.
This begets a number of lenders, and &s;inks the rate
of u&s;ury; and this, I &s;hall venture to affirm, depends
not on the quantity of &s;pecie, but on particular man|ners
and cu&s;toms, which make the &s;pecie gather into
&s;eparate &s;ums or ma&s;&s;es of con&s;iderable value.</P>
<P><PB N="69" REF="72">
FOR &s;uppo&s;e, that, by miracle, every man in BRI|TAIN
&s;hould have five pounds &s;lipt into his pocket
in one night; this would much more than double the
whole money that is at pre&s;ent in the kingdom; and
yet there would not next day, nor for &s;ome time, be
any more lenders, nor any variation on the intere&s;t.
And were there nothing but landlords and pea&s;ants in
the &s;tate, this money, however abundant, could ne|ver
gather into &s;ums; and would only &s;erve to increa&s;e
the prices of every thing, without any farther con&s;e|quence.
The prodigal landlord di&s;&s;ipates it, as fa&s;t
as he receives it; and the beggarly pea&s;ant has no
means, nor view, nor ambition of obtaining above a
bare livelihood. The overplus of borrowers above
that of lenders continuing &s;till the &s;ame, there will
follow no reduction of intere&s;t. That depends upon
another principle; and mu&s;t proceed from an increa&s;e
of indu&s;try and frugality, of arts and commerce.</P>
<P>EVERY thing u&s;eful to the life of man ari&s;es from
the ground; but few things ari&s;e in that condition
which is requi&s;ite to render them u&s;eful. There mu&s;t,
therefore, be&s;ide the pea&s;ants, and the proprietors of
land, be another rank of men, who, receiving from
the former, the rude materials, work them into their
proper form, and retain part for their own u&s;e and
&s;ub&s;i&s;tence. In the infancy of &s;ociety, the&s;e contracts
betwixt the arti&s;ans and the pea&s;ants, and betwixt one
&s;pecies of arti&s;ans and another, are commonly entered
<PB N="70" REF="73">
into immediately by the per&s;ons them&s;elves, who, be|ing
neighbours, are ea&s;ily acquainted with each other's
nece&s;&s;ities, and can lend their mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance to &s;up|ply
them. But when men's indu&s;try increa&s;es, and
their views enlarge, 'tis found, that the mo&s;t remote
parts of the &s;tate can a&s;&s;i&s;t each other as well as the
more contiguous, and that this intercour&s;e of good
offices may be carried on to the greate&s;t extent and
intricacy. Hence the origin of <HI>merchants,</HI> the mo&s;t
u&s;eful race of men in the whole &s;ociety, who &s;erve
as agents between tho&s;e parts of the &s;tate, that are
wholly unacquainted, and are ignorant of each other's
nece&s;&s;ities. Here are in a city fifty workmen in &s;ilk
and linen, and a thou&s;and cu&s;tomers; and the&s;e two
ranks of men, &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to each other, can never
rightly meet, till one man erects a &s;hop, to which all
the workmen and all the cu&s;tomers repair. In this
province, gra&s;s ri&s;es in abundance: The inhabitants
abound in chee&s;e, and butter, and cattle; but want
bread and corn, which, in a neighbouring province,
are in too great abundance for the u&s;e of the inhabi|tants.
One man di&s;covers this. He brings corn from
the one province, and returns with cattle; and &s;up|plying
the wants of both, he is, &s;o far, a common
benefactor. As the people increa&s;e in numbers and
indu&s;try, the difficulty of their intercour&s;e increa&s;es;
The bu&s;ine&s;s of the agency or merchandize becomes
more intricate; and divides, &s;ubdivides, compounds,
and mixes to a greater variety. In all the&s;e tran&s;ac|tions,
<PB N="71" REF="74">
'tis nece&s;&s;ary, and rea&s;onable, that a con&s;ide|rable
part of the commodities and labour &s;hould be|long
to the merchant, to whom, in a great mea&s;ure,
they are owing. And the&s;e commodities he will &s;ome|times
pre&s;erve in kind, or more commonly convert
into money, which is their common repre&s;entation.
If gold and &s;ilver have increa&s;ed in the &s;tate together
with the indu&s;try, it will require a great quantity of
the&s;e metals to repre&s;ent a great quantity of commo|dities
and labour. If indu&s;try alone has increa&s;ed,
the prices of every thing mu&s;t &s;ink, and a very &s;mall
quantity of &s;pecie will &s;erve as a repre&s;entation.</P>
<P>THERE is no craving or demand of the human
mind more con&s;tant and in&s;atiable than that for exer|ci&s;e
and employment; and this de&s;ire &s;eems the foun|dation
of mo&s;t of our pa&s;&s;ions and pur&s;uits. Deprive
a man of all bu&s;ine&s;s and &s;erious occupation, he runs
re&s;tle&s;s from one amu&s;ement to another; and the
weight and oppre&s;&s;ion which he feels from idlene&s;s,
is &s;o great, that he forgets the ruin which mu&s;t fol|low
from his immoderate expences. Give him a
more harmle&s;s way of employing his mind or body,
he is &s;atisfied, and feels no longer that in&s;atiable thir&s;t
after plea&s;ure. But if the employment you give him
be profitable, e&s;pecially if the profit be attached to
every particular exertion of indu&s;try, he has gain &s;o
often in his eye, that he acquires, by degrees, a pa&s;|&s;ion
for it, and knows no &s;uch plea&s;ure as that of
<PB N="72" REF="75">
&s;eeing the daily increa&s;e of his fortune. And this is
the rea&s;on why trade increa&s;es frugality, and why,
among merchants, there is the &s;ame overplus of mi&s;ers
above prodigals, as, among the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of land,
there is the contrary.</P>
<P>COMMERCE increa&s;es indu&s;try, by conveying it
readily from one member of the &s;tate to another, and
allowing none of it to peri&s;h or become u&s;ele&s;s. It
increa&s;es frugality, by giving occupation to men, and
employing them in the arts of gain, which &s;oon en|gage
their affection, and remove all reli&s;h for plea&s;ure
and expence. 'Tis an infallible con&s;equence of all
indu&s;trious profe&s;&s;ions, to beget frugality, and make
the love of gain prevail over the love of plea&s;ure.
Among lawyers and phy&s;icians who have any practice,
there are many more who live within their income,
than who exceed it, or even live up to it. But law|yers
and phy&s;icians beget no indu&s;try; and 'tis even
at the expence of others they acquire their riches;
&s;o that they are &s;ure to dimini&s;h the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of &s;ome
of their fellow-citizens as fa&s;t as they increa&s;e their
own. Merchants, on the contrary, beget indu&s;try,
by &s;erving as canals to convey it thro' every corner of
the &s;tate; and at the &s;ame time, by their frugality,
they acquire great power over that indu&s;try, and col|lect
a large property in the labour and commodities,
which they are the chief in&s;truments in producing.
There is no other profe&s;&s;ion, therefore, except mer|chandize,
<PB N="73" REF="76">
which can make the monied intere&s;t con|&s;iderable,
or, in other words, can increa&s;e indu&s;try,
and, by al&s;o increa&s;ing frugality, give a great com|mand
of that indu&s;try to particular members of the
&s;ociety. Without commerce, the &s;tate mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t
chiefly of landed gentry, who&s;e prodigality and ex|pence
make a continual demand for borrowing; and
of pea&s;ants, who have no &s;ums to &s;upply that demand.
The money never gathers into large &s;tocks or &s;ums,
which can be lent at intere&s;t. It is di&s;per&s;ed into
numberle&s;s hands, who either &s;quander it in idle
&s;how and magnificence, or employ it in the purcha&s;e
of the common nece&s;&s;aries of life. Commerce alone
a&s;&s;embles it into con&s;iderable &s;ums; and this effect it
has merely from the indu&s;try which it begets, and the
frugality which it in&s;pires, independent of that parti|cular
quantity of precious metal which may circulate
in the &s;tate.</P>
<P>THUS an increa&s;e of commerce, by a nece&s;&s;ary
con&s;equence, rai&s;es a great number of lenders, and
by that means produces a lowne&s;s of intere&s;t. We
mu&s;t now con&s;ider how far this increa&s;e of commerce
dimini&s;hes the profits ari&s;ing from that profe&s;&s;ion, and
gives ri&s;e to the <HI>third</HI> circum&s;tance requi&s;ite to pro|duce
a lowne&s;s of intere&s;t.</P>
<P>IT may be proper to ob&s;erve on this head, that
low intere&s;t and low profits of merchandize are two
<PB N="74" REF="77">
events, that mutually forward each other, and are
both originally derived from that exten&s;ive commerce,
which produces opulent merchants, and renders the
monied intere&s;t con&s;iderable. Where merchants po&s;|&s;e&s;s
great &s;tocks, whether repre&s;ented by few or many
pieces of metal, it mu&s;t frequently happen, that when
they either become tired of bu&s;ine&s;s, or have heirs
unwilling or unfit to engage in commerce, a great
deal of the&s;e riches naturally &s;eeks an annual and &s;e|cure
revenue. The plenty dimini&s;hes the price, and
makes the lenders accept of a low intere&s;t. This con|&s;ideration
obliges many to keep their &s;tocks in trade,
and rather be content with low profit than di&s;po&s;e of
their money at an under value. On the other hand,
when commerce has become very exten&s;ive, and em|ploys
very large &s;tocks, there mu&s;t ari&s;e rival&s;hips
among the merchants, which dimini&s;h the profits of
trade, at the &s;ame time that they increa&s;e the trade
it&s;elf. The low profits of merchandize induce the
merchants to accept more willingly of a low intere&s;t,
when they leave off bu&s;ine&s;s, and begin to indulge
them&s;elves in ea&s;e and indolence. It is needle&s;s, there|fore,
to enquire which of the&s;e circum&s;tances, <HI>viz. low
intere&s;ts or low profits,</HI> is the cau&s;e, and which the effect?
They both ari&s;e from an exten&s;ive commerce, and mu|tually
forward each other. No man will accept of low
profits, where he can have high intere&s;t; and no man
will accept of low intere&s;t, where he can have high
profits. An exten&s;ive commerce, by producing large
ftocks, dimini&s;hes both intere&s;t and profit; and is al|ways
<PB N="75" REF="78">
a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in its diminution of the one, by the
proportional &s;inking of the other. I may add, that
as low profits ari&s;e from the increa&s;e of commerce and
indu&s;try, they &s;erve in their turn to the farther in|crea&s;e
of commerce, by rendering the commodities
cheaper, encouraging the con&s;umption, and heighten|ing
the indu&s;try. And thus, if we con&s;ider the whole
connection of cau&s;es and effects, intere&s;t is the true
barometer of the &s;tate, and its lowne&s;s is a &s;ign al|mo&s;t
infallible of the flouri&s;hing of a people. It proves
the increa&s;e of indu&s;try, and its prompt circulation
thro' the whole &s;tate, little inferior to a demon&s;tration,
And tho', perhaps, it may not be impo&s;&s;ible but a
&s;udden and a great check to commerce may have a
momentary effect of the &s;ame kind, by throwing &s;o
many &s;tocks out of trade; it mu&s;t be attended with
&s;uch mi&s;ery and want of employment in the poor,
that, be&s;ides its &s;hort duration, it will not be po&s;&s;ible
to mi&s;take the one ca&s;e for the other.</P>
<P>THOSE who have a&s;&s;erted, that the plenty of mo|ney
was the cau&s;e of low intere&s;t, &s;eem to have taken
a collateral effect for a cau&s;e; &s;ince the &s;ame indu&s;try
which &s;inks the intere&s;t, does commonly acquire great
abundance of the precious metals, A variety of fine
manufactures, with vigilant enterpri&s;ing merchants,
will &s;oon draw money to a &s;tate, if it be any where
to be found in the world. The &s;ame cau&s;e, by multi|plying
the conveniencies of life, and increa&s;ing in|du&s;try,
<PB N="76" REF="79">
collects great riches into the hands of per|&s;ons,
who are not proprietors of land, and produces
by that means a lowne&s;s of intere&s;t. But tho' both
the&s;e effects, plenty of money and low intere&s;t, natu|rally
ari&s;e from commerce and indu&s;try, they are al|together
independent of each other. For &s;uppo&s;e a
nation removed into the <HI>Pacific</HI> ocean, without any
foreign commerce, or any knowledge of navigation:
Suppo&s;e, that this nation po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es always the &s;ame
&s;tock of coin, but is continually increa&s;ing in its num|bers
and indu&s;try: 'Tis evident, that the price of
every commodity mu&s;t gradually dimini&s;h in that king|dom;
&s;ince 'tis the proportion between money and any
&s;pecies of goods, which fixes their mutual value; and,
upon the pre&s;ent &s;uppo&s;ition, the conveniencies of life
become every day more abundant, without any alte|ration
on the current &s;pecie. A le&s;s quantity of mo|ney,
therefore, among&s;t this people, will make a rich
man, during the times of indu&s;try, than would &s;erve
to that purpo&s;e, in ignorant and &s;lothful ages. Le&s;s
money will build a hou&s;e, portion a daughter, buy an
e&s;tate, &s;upport a manufactory, or maintain a family
and equipage. The&s;e are the u&s;es for which men bor|row
money; and therefore, the greater or le&s;s quan|tity
of it in a &s;tate has no influence on the intere&s;t.
But 'tis evident, that the greater or le&s;s &s;tock of labour
and commodities mu&s;t have a great in&s;luence; &s;ince
we really and in effect borrow the&s;e, when we take
money upon intere&s;t. 'Tis true, when commerce is ex|tended
<PB N="77" REF="80">
all over the globe, the mo&s;t indu&s;trious nations
always abound mo&s;t with the precious metals: So
that low intere&s;t and plenty of money are in fact al|mo&s;t
in&s;eparable. But &s;till 'tis of con&s;equence to know
the principle whence any phaenomenon ari&s;es, and to
di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt a cau&s;e and a concomitant effect.
Be&s;ides that the &s;peculation is curious, it may fre|quently
be of u&s;e in the conduct of public affairs. At
lea&s;t, it mu&s;t be owned, that nothing can be of more
u&s;e than to improve, by practice, the method of rea|&s;oning
on the&s;e &s;ubjects, which of all others are the

<P>ANOTHER rea&s;on of this popular mi&s;take with re|gard
to the cau&s;e of low intere&s;t, &s;eems to be the in|&s;tance
of &s;ome nations; where, after a &s;udden acqui|&s;ition
of money, or of the precious metals, by means
of foreign conque&s;t, the intere&s;t has fallen, not only
among them, but in all the neighbouring &s;tates, as
&s;oon as that money was di&s;per&s;ed, and had in&s;inuated
it&s;elf into every corner. Thus, intere&s;t in SPAIN fell
near a half immediately after the di&s;covery of the
WEST INDIES, as we are informed by GARCILASSO
DE LA VEGA: And it has been ever &s;ince gradually
&s;inking in every kingdom of EUROPE. Intere&s;t in
ROME, after the conque&s;t of EGYPT, fell from 6 to
$ <HI>per cent.</HI> as we learn from DION<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="81">
THE cau&s;es of the &s;inking of intere&s;t upon &s;uch an
event, &s;eem different in the conquering country and
in the neighbouring &s;tates; but in neither of them
can we ju&s;tly a&s;cribe that effect merely to the increa&s;e
of gold and &s;ilver.</P>
<P>IN the conquering country, 'tis natural to imagine,
that this new acqui&s;ition of money will fall into a few
hands, and be gathered into large &s;ums, which &s;eek
a &s;ecure revenue, either by the purcha&s;e of land or by
intere&s;t; and con&s;equently the &s;ame effect follows, for
a little time, as if there had been a great acce&s;&s;ion of
indu&s;try and commerce. The increa&s;e of lenders
above the borrowers &s;inks the intere&s;t; and &s;o much
the fa&s;ter, if tho&s;e who have acquired tho&s;e large
&s;ums, find no indu&s;try or commerce in the &s;tate, and
no method of employing their money but by lending
it at intere&s;t. But after this new ma&s;s of gold and
&s;ilver has been dige&s;ted, and has circulated thro' the
whole &s;tate, affairs will &s;oon return to their former
&s;ituation: while the landlords and new money-hold|ers,
living idly, &s;quander above their income; and
the former daily contract debt, and the latter incroach
on their &s;tock till its final extinction. The whole mo|ney
may &s;till be in the &s;tate, and make it&s;elf felt by
the increa&s;e of prices: But not being now collected
into any large ma&s;&s;es or &s;tocks, the di&s;proportion be|tween
the borrowers and lenders is the &s;ame as for|merly,
and con&s;equently the high intere&s;t returns.</P>
<P><PB N="79" REF="82">
ACCORDINGLY we find, in ROME, that &s;o early
as TIBERIUS'S time, intere&s;t had again mounted to
6 <HI>per cent.</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">COLUMELLA, lib. 3. cap. 3.</NOTE> tho' no accident had happened to drain
the empire of money. In TRAJAN'S time, money
lent on mortgages in ITALY, bore 6 <HI>per cent</HI><NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">PLINII epi&s;t. lib. 7. ep. 18.</NOTE>; on
common &s;ecurities in BITHYNIA, 12<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Id. lib. 10. ep. 62.</NOTE>. And if in|tere&s;t
in SPAIN has not ri&s;en to its old pitch; this can
be a&s;cribed to nothing but the continuance of the &s;ame
cau&s;e that &s;unk it, <HI>viz.</HI> the large fortunes continually
made in the INDIES, which come over to SPAIN from
time to time, and &s;upply the demand of the bor|rowers.
By this accidental and extraneous cau&s;e,
more money is to be lent in SPAIN, that is, more mo|ney
is collected into large &s;ums, than would otherwi&s;e
be found in a &s;tate, where there are &s;o little commerce
and indu&s;try.</P>
<P>AS to the reduction of intere&s;t, which has followed
in ENGLAND, FRANCE, and other kingdoms of EU|ROPE,
that have no mines, it has been gradual; and
has not proceeded from the increa&s;e of money, con|&s;idered
merely in it&s;elf; but from the increa&s;e of in|du&s;try,
which is the natural effect of the former in|crea&s;e,
in that interval, before it rai&s;es the price of
labour and provi&s;ions. For to return to the foregoing
&s;uppo&s;ition; if the indu&s;try of ENGLAND had ri&s;en
<PB N="80" REF="83">
as much from other cau&s;es, (and that ri&s;e might ea&s;ily
have happened, tho' the &s;tock of money had remained
the &s;ame) mu&s;t not all the &s;ame con&s;equences have
followed, which we ob&s;erve at pre&s;ent? The &s;ame
people would, in that ca&s;e, be found in the kingdom,
the &s;ame commodities, the &s;ame indu&s;try, manufac|tures,
and commerce; and con&s;equently the &s;ame
merchants, with the &s;ame &s;tocks, that is, with the
&s;ame command over labour and commodities, only
repre&s;ented by a &s;maller number of white or yellow
pieces; which being a circum&s;tance of no moment,
would only affect the waggoner, porter, and trunk|maker.
Luxury, therefore, manufactures, arts, in|du&s;try,
frugality, flouri&s;hing equally as at pre&s;ent, 'tis
evident that intere&s;t mu&s;t al&s;o have been as low; &s;ince
that is the nece&s;&s;ary re&s;ult of all the&s;e circum&s;tances;
&s;o far as they determine the profits of commerce, and
the proportion between the borrowers and lenders in
any &s;tate.</P>

<P>'TIS very u&s;ual, in nations ignorant of the na|ture

whatever they think valuable and u&s;eful. They con|&s;ider

contrary to their intention; and that the more is ex|ported
of any commodity, the more will be rai&s;ed at
home, of which they them&s;elves will always have
the fir&s;t offer.</P>
<P>'TIS well known to the learned, that the antient

that being &s;uppo&s;ed a &s;pecies of fruit &s;o ex|cellent
in ATTICA, that the ATHENIANS e&s;teemed it
too delicious for the palate of any foreigner. And in
this ridiculous prohibition they were &s;o much in ear|ne&s;t,
that reformers were thence called <HI>&s;ycophants</HI>

in the nature of commerce. And to this day,
in FRANCE, the exportation of corn is almo&s;t al|ways
prohibited; in order, as they &s;ay, to prevent
famines; tho' 'tis evident, that nothing contributes
more to the frequent famines which &s;o much di&s;tre&s;s
that fertile country.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame jealous fear, with regard to money, has
al&s;o prevailed among &s;everal nations; and it required
both rea&s;on and experience to convince any people,
that the&s;e prohibitions &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e than
to rai&s;e the exchange again&s;t them, and produce a &s;till
greater exportation.</P>
<P>THESE errors, one may &s;ay, are gro&s;s and palpable:
But there &s;till prevails, even in nations well acquainted
with commerce, a &s;trong jealou&s;y with regard to the
balance of trade, and a fear, that all their gold and
&s;ilver may be leaving them. This &s;eems to me, al|mo&s;t
in every ca&s;e, a very groundle&s;s apprehen&s;ion;
and I &s;hould as &s;oon dread, that all our &s;prings and
rivers &s;hould be exhau&s;ted, as that money &s;hould aban|don
a kingdom where there are people and indu&s;try.
Let us carefully pre&s;erve the&s;e latter advantages; and
we need never be apprehen&s;ive of lo&s;ing the former.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="86">
'TIS ea&s;y to ob&s;erve, that all calculations concern|ing
the balance of trade are founded on very uncer|tain
facts and &s;uppo&s;itions. The cu&s;tomhou&s;e-books
are owned to be an in&s;ufficient ground of rea&s;oning;
nor is the rate of exchange much better; unle&s;s we
con&s;ider it with all nations, and know al&s;o the pro|portions
of the &s;everal &s;ums remitted; which one may
&s;afely pronounce impo&s;&s;ible. Every man who has
ever rea&s;oned on this &s;ubject, has always proved his
theory, whatever it was, by facts and calculations,
and by an enumeration of all the commodities &s;ent to
all foreign kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE writings of Mr. GEE &s;truck the nation with
an univer&s;al panic, when they &s;aw it plainly demon|&s;trated,
by a detail of particulars, that the balance was
again&s;t them for &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;um as mu&s;t leave
them without a &s;ingle &s;hilling in five or &s;ix years. But,
luckily, twenty years have &s;ince elap&s;ed, with an ex|pen&s;ive
foreign war; and yet it is commonly &s;uppo&s;ed,
that money is &s;till more plentiful among us than in
any former period.</P>
<P>NOTHING can be more entertaining on this head
than Dr. SWIFT; an author &s;o quick in di&s;cerning
the mi&s;takes or ab&s;urdities of others. He &s;ays, in his
<HI>&s;hort view of the &s;tate of</HI> IRELAND, that the whole
ca&s;h of that kingdom amounted but to 500,000 <HI>l.;</HI>
that out of this they remitted every year a neat mil|lion
<PB N="84" REF="87">
to ENGLAND, and had &s;carce any other &s;ource
from which they could compen&s;ate them&s;elves, and
little other foreign trade but the importation of
FRENCH wines, for which they paid ready money.
The con&s;equence of this &s;ituation, which mu&s;t be
owned di&s;advantageous, was, that in a cour&s;e of three
years, the current money of IRELAND, from <HI>500,000l.</HI>
was reduced to le&s;s than two. And at pre&s;ent, I &s;up|po&s;e,
in a cour&s;e of near 30 years, it is ab&s;olutely
nothing. Yet I know not how, that opinion of the
advance of riches in IRELAND, which gave the Doc|tor
&s;o much indignation, &s;eems &s;till to continue, and
gain ground with every body.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, this apprehen&s;ion of the wrong balance
of trade, appears of &s;uch a nature, that it di&s;covers
it&s;elf, where-ever one is out of humour with the mi|ni&s;try,
or is in low &s;pirits; and as it can never be re|futed
by a particular detail of all the exports, which
counterbalance the imports, it may here be proper to
form a general argument, which may prove the im|po&s;&s;ibility
of that event, as long as we pre&s;erve our
people and our indu&s;try.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE four fifths of all the money in BRITAIN
to be annihilated in one night, and the nation reduced
to the &s;ame condition, with regard to &s;pecie, as in the
reigns of the HARRYS and EDWARDS, what would
be the con&s;equence? Mu&s;t not the price of all labour
<PB N="85" REF="88">
and commodities &s;ink in proportion, and every thing
be &s;old as cheap as they were in tho&s;e ages? What
nation could then di&s;pute with us in any foreign mar|ket,
or pretend to navigate or to &s;ell manufactures at
the &s;ame price, which to us would afford &s;ufficient
profit? In how little time, therefore, mu&s;t this bring
back the money which we had lo&s;t, and rai&s;e us to
the level of all the neighbouring nations? Where,
after we have arrived, we immediately lo&s;e the ad|vantage
of the cheapne&s;s of labour and commodities;
and the farther flowing in of money is &s;topped by our
fuine&s;s and repletion.</P>
<P>AGAIN, &s;uppo&s;e, that all the money in BRITAIN
were multiplied fivefold in a night, mu&s;t not the con|trary
effect follow? Mu&s;t not all labour and commo|dities
ri&s;e to &s;uch an exorbitant height, that no neigh|bouring
nations could afford to buy from us; while
their commodities, on the other hand, became &s;o
cheap in compari&s;on, that, in &s;pite of all the laws
which could be formed, they would be run in upon
us, and our money flow out; till we fall to a level
with foreigners, and lo&s;e that great &s;uperiority of riches,
which had laid us under &s;uch di&s;advantages?</P>
<P>NOW, 'tis evident, that the &s;ame cau&s;es which
would correct the&s;e exorbitant inequalities, were
they to happen miraculou&s;ly, mu&s;t prevent their hap|pening
in the common cour&s;e of nature, and mu&s;t for
<PB N="86" REF="89">
ever in all the neighbouring nations, pre&s;erve money
nearly proportionable to the art and indu&s;try of each
nation. All water, where-ever it communicates, re|mains
always at a level. A&s;k naturali&s;ts the rea&s;on;
they tell you, that were it to be rai&s;ed in any one
place, the &s;uperior gravity of that part not being ba|lanced,
mu&s;t depre&s;s it, till$$it meets a counterpoi&s;e;
and that the &s;ame cau&s;e which redre&s;&s;es the inequality
when it happens, mu&s;t for ever prevent it, without
&s;ome violent external operation<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">There is another cau&s;e, tho' more limited in its operation, which checks the wrong balance of trade, to every particular nation to which the kingdom trades. When we import more goods than we export, the exchange turns again&s;t us, and this becomes a new encouragement to export; as much as the charge of carriage and in&s;urance of the money which becomes due would amount to. For the exchange can never ri&s;e higher than that &s;um.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>CAN one imagine, that it had ever been po&s;&s;ible,
by any laws, or even by any art or indu&s;try, to have
kept all the money in SPAIN, which the galleons have
brought from the INDIES? or that all commodities
could be &s;old in FRANCE for a tenth of the price
which they would yield on the other &s;ide of the PY|RENEES,
without finding their way thither, and drain|ing
from that immen&s;e trea&s;ure? What other rea&s;on,
indeed, is there, why all nations, at pre&s;ent, gain in
<PB N="87" REF="90">
their trade with SPAIN and PORTUGAL; but becau&s;e
it is impo&s;&s;ible to heap up money, more than any fluid,
beyond its proper level? The &s;overeigns of the&s;e
countries have &s;hown, that they wanted not inclina|tion
to keep their gold and &s;ilver to them&s;elves, had
it been in any degree practicable.</P>
<P>BUT as any body of water may be rai&s;ed above the
level of the &s;urrounding element, if the former has
no communication with the latter; &s;o in money, if
the communication be cut off, by any material or phy|&s;ical
impediment, (for all laws alone are ineffectual)
there may, in &s;uch a ca&s;e, be a very great inequality
of money. Thus the immen&s;e di&s;tance of CHINA,
together with the monopolies of our INDIA compa|nies,
ob&s;tructing the communication, pre&s;erve in EU|ROPE
the gold and &s;ilver, e&s;pecially the latter, in
much greater plenty than they are found in that king|dom.
But, notwith&s;tanding this great ob&s;truction,
the force of the cau&s;es above-mentioned is &s;till evident.
The &s;kill and ingenuity of EUROPE in general &s;urpa&s;&s;es
perhaps that of CHINA, with regard to manual arts
and manufactures; yet are we never able to trade
thither without great di&s;advantage. And were it not
for the continual recruits which we receive from
AMERICA, money would very &s;oon &s;ink in EUROPE,
and ri&s;e in CHINA, till it came nearly to a level in
both places. Nor can any rea&s;onable man doubt,
<PB N="88" REF="91">
but that indu&s;trious nation, were they as near us as
POLAND or BARBARY, would drain us of the over-plus
of our &s;pecie, and draw to them&s;elves a larger
&s;hare of the WEST-INDIAN trea&s;ures. We need have
no recour&s;e to a phy&s;ical attraction, to explain the ne|ce&s;&s;ity
of this operation. There is a moral attraction,
ari&s;ing from the intere&s;ts and pa&s;&s;ions of men, which
is full as potent and infallible.</P>
<P>How is the balance kept in the provinces of every
kingdom among them&s;elves, but by the force of this
principle, which makes it impo&s;&s;ible for money to
lo&s;e its level, and either to ri&s;e or &s;ink beyond the
proportion of the labour and commodities which is
in each province? Did not long experience make
people ea&s;y on this head, what a fund of gloomy re|flections
might calculations afford a melancholy YORK|SHIREMAN,
while he computed and magnified the
&s;ums drawn to LONDON by taxes, ab&s;entees, commo|dities,
and found on compari&s;on the oppo&s;ite articles
&s;o much inferior? And no doubt, had the <HI>Heptarchy</HI>
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted in ENGLAND, the legi&s;lature of each &s;tate
had been continually alarmed by the fear of a wrong
balance; and as 'tis probable that the mutual hatred
of the&s;e &s;tates would have been extremely violent on
account of their clo&s;e neighbourhood, they would
have loaded and oppre&s;&s;ed all commerce, by a jealous
and &s;uperfluous caution. Since the union has removed
the barriers between SCOTLAND and ENGLAND, which
<PB N="89" REF="92">
of the&s;e nations gains from the other by this free
commerce? Or if the former kingdom has received
any increa&s;e of riches, can it be rea&s;onably accounted
for by any thing but the increa&s;e of its art and in|du&s;try?
It was a common apprehen&s;ion in ENGLAND,
before the union, as we learn from L'ABBE DU BOS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Les interets d' <HI>ANGLETERRE</HI> mal-entendus.</NOTE>,
that SCOTLAND would &s;oon drain them of their trea|&s;ure,
were an open trade allowed; and on the other
&s;ide the TWEED a contrary apprehen&s;ion prevailed:
With what ju&s;tice in both, time has &s;hown.</P>
<P>WHAT happens in &s;mall protions of mankind, mu&s;t
take place in greater. The provinces of the ROMAN
empire, no doubt, kept their balance with each other,
and with ITALY, independant of the legi&s;lature; as
much as the &s;everal counties of BRITAIN, or the &s;e|veral
pari&s;hes of each county. And any man who
travels over EUROPE at this day, may &s;ee by the prices
of commodities, that money, in &s;pite of the ab&s;urd
jealou&s;y of princes and &s;tates, has brought it&s;elf nearly
to a level; and that the difference between one king|dom
and another is not greater in this re&s;pect, than it
is often between different provinces of the &s;ame king|dom.
Men naturally $lock to capital cities, &s;ea-ports,
and navigable rivers. There we find more men, more
indu&s;try, more commodities, and con&s;equently more
<PB N="90" REF="93">
money; but &s;till the latter difference holds proportion
with the former, and the level is pre&s;erved<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">It mu&s;t carefully be remarked, that, thro' out this di&s;cour&s;e, where-ever I &s;peak of the level of money, I mean always its pro|portional level to the commodities, labour, indu&s;try, and &s;kill, which is in the &s;everal &s;tates. And I a&s;&s;ert, that where the&s;e advantages are double, triple, quadruple, to what they are in the neighbouring &s;tates, the money infallibly will al&s;o be double, triple, quadruple. The only circum&s;tance that can ob&s;truct the exactne&s;s of the&s;e proportions, is the expence of tran&s;porting the commodities from one place to another; and this expence is &s;ometimes unequal. Thus the corn, cattle, chee&s;e, butter, of DEREYSHIRE, cannot draw the money of LONDON, &s;o much as the manufactures of LONDON draw the money of DERBY|SHIRE. But this objection is only a &s;eeming one: For &s;o far as the tran&s;port of commodities is expen&s;ive, &s;o far is the commu|nication between the place ob&s;tructed and imperfect.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>OUR jealou&s;y and our hatred of FRANCE, are with|out
bounds; and the former &s;entiment, at lea&s;t, mu&s;t
be acknowledged very rea&s;onable and well-grounded.
The&s;e pa&s;&s;ions have occa&s;ioned innumerable barriers
and ob&s;tructions upon commerce, where we are ac|cu&s;ed
of being commonly the aggre&s;&s;ors. But what
have we gained by the bargain? We lo&s;t the FRENCH
market for our woollen manufactures, and transferred
the commerce of wine to SPAIN and PORTUGAL,
where we buy much wor&s;e liquor at a higher price.
There are few ENGLISHMEN who would not think
<PB N="91" REF="94">
their country ab&s;olutely ruined, were FRENCH wines
&s;old in ENGLAND &s;o cheap and in &s;uch abundance as
to &s;upplant, in &s;ome mea&s;ure, all ale, and home-brewed
liquors: But would we lay a&s;ide prejudice,
it would not be difficult to prove, that nothing could
be more innocent, perhaps advantageous. Each new
acre of vineyard planted in FRANCE, in order to &s;up|ply
ENGLAND with wine, would make it requi&s;ite for
the FRENCH to take the product of an ENGLISH acre,
&s;own in wheat or barley, in order to &s;ub&s;i&s;t them&s;elves;
and 'tis evident, that we have thereby got command
of the better commodity.</P>
<P>THERE are many edicts of the FRENCH King, pro|hibiting
the planting of new vineyards, and ordering
all tho&s;e already planted to be grubbed up: So &s;en&s;ible
are they in that country, of the &s;uperior value of corn,
above every other product.</P>
<P>MARESCHAL VAUBAN complains often, and with
rea&s;on, of the ab&s;urd duties which load the entry of
tho&s;e wines of LANGUEDOC, GU$$$NNE, and other
&s;outhern provinces, that are imported into BRITANY
and NORMANDY. He entertained no doubt but
the&s;e latter provinces could pre&s;erve their balance,
notwith&s;tanding the open commerce which he recom|mends.
And 'tis evident, that a few leagues more
navigation to ENGLAND would make no difference;
<PB N="92" REF="95">
or if it did, that it mu&s;t operate alike on the commo|dities
of both kingdoms.</P>
<P>THERE is indeed one expedient by which it is po&s;|&s;ible
to &s;ink, and another by which we may rai&s;e,
money beyond its natural level in any kingdom; but
the&s;e ca&s;es, when examined, will be found to re&s;olve
into our general theory, and to bring additional au|thority
to it.</P>
<P>$SCARCE know any method of &s;inking money be|low
its level, but tho&s;e in&s;titutions of banks, funds,
and paper-credit, with which we are in this kingdom
&s;o much infatuated. The&s;e render paper equivalent
to money, circulate it thro' the whole &s;tate, make it
&s;upply the place of gold and &s;ilver, rai&s;e proportion|ably
the price of labour and commodities, and by that
means either bani&s;h a great part of tho&s;e precious me|tals,
or prevent their farther increa&s;e. What can be
more &s;hort&s;ighted than our rea&s;onings on this head?
We fancy, becau&s;e an individual would be much
richer, were his &s;tock of money doubled, that the
&s;ame good effect would follow were the money of
every one increa&s;ed; not con&s;idering, that this would
rai&s;e as much the price of every commodity, and re|duce
every man, in time, to the &s;ame condition as
before. 'Tis only in our public negotiations and tran&s;|actions
with foreigners, that a greater &s;tock of money
is advantageous; and as our paper is there ab&s;olutely

and we mu&s;t immediately draw from all of them, till
we be full and &s;aturate, &s;o to &s;peak, and can hold no
more. By our wi&s;e politics, we are careful to &s;tuff
<PB N="94" REF="97">
the nation with this fine commodity of bank-bills and
chequer notes, as if we were afraid of being over-burthened
with the precious metals.</P>
<P>'TIS not to be doubted, but the great plenty of
bullion in FRANCE is, in a great mea&s;ure, owing to
the want of paper-credit. The FRENCH have no
banks: Merchants bills do not there circulate as with
us: U&s;ury or lending on intere&s;t is not directly per|mitted;
&s;o that many have large &s;ums in their coffers:
Great quantities of plate are u&s;ed in private hou&s;es;
and all the churches are full of it. By this means,
provi&s;ions and labour &s;till remain much cheaper among
them, than in nations that are not half &s;o rich in gold
and &s;ilver. The advantages of this &s;ituation in point
of trade, as well as in great public emergencies, are
too evident to be di&s;puted.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame fa&s;hion a few years ago prevailed in GE|NOA,
which &s;till has place in ENGLAND and HOLLAND,
of u&s;ing &s;ervices of CHINA ware in&s;tead of
plate; but the &s;enate, wi&s;ely &s;ore&s;eeing the con&s;e|quence,
prohibited the u&s;e of that brittle commodity
beyond a certain extent; while the u&s;e of &s;ilver plate
was left unlimited. And I &s;uppo&s;e, in their late di&s;|tre&s;&s;es,
they &s;elt the good effect of this ordinance.
Our tax on plate is, perhaps, in this view, &s;omewhat
impolitic.</P>

BEFORE the introduction of paper-money into our
colonies, they had gold and &s;ilver &s;ufficient for their
circulation. Since the introduction of that commo|dity,
the lea&s;t inconveniency that has followed is the
total bani&s;hment of the precious metals. And after
the abolition of paper, can it be doubted but money
will return, while the&s;e colonies po&s;&s;e&s;s manufactures
and commodities, the only thing valuable in com|merce,
and for who&s;e &s;ake alone all men de&s;ire mo|ney?</P>
<P>WHAT

when he wanted to bani&s;h gold and &s;ilver from
SPARTA! It would have &s;erved his purpo&s;e better
than the lumps of iron he made u&s;e of as money;
and would al&s;o have prevented more effectually all
commerce with &s;trangers, as being of &s;o much le&s;s
real and intrin&s;ic value.</P>
<P>BUT as our darling projects of paper-credit are per|nicious,
being almo&s;t the only expedient by which
we can &s;ink money below its level; &s;o, in my opi|nion,
the only expedient by which we can rai&s;e mo|ney
above its level, is a practice which we &s;hould all
exclaim again&s;t as de&s;tructive, <HI>viz.</HI> the gathering large
&s;ums into a public trea&s;ure, locking them up, and
ab&s;olutely preventing their circulation. The fluid, not
communicating with the neighbouring element, may,
by &s;uch an artifice, be rai&s;ed to what height we plea&s;e.
<PB N="96" REF="99">
To prove this, we need only return to our fir&s;t &s;up|po&s;ition,
of the annihilating the half or any part of
our ca&s;h; where we found, that the immediate con|&s;equence
of &s;uch an event would be the attraction of
an equal &s;um from all the neighbouring kingdoms.
Nor does there &s;eem to be any nece&s;&s;ary bounds &s;et,
by the nature of things, to this practice of hoarding.
A &s;mall city, like GENEVA, continuing this policy
for ages, might ingro&s;s nine tenths of the money of
EUROPE. There &s;eems, indeed, in the nature of
man, an invincible ob&s;tacle to that immen&s;e growth
of riches. A weak &s;tate, with an enormous trea&s;ure,
would &s;oon become a prey to &s;ome of its poorer, but
more powerful neighbours. A great &s;tate would di&s;|&s;$pate
its wealth on dangerous and ill-concerted pro|jects;
and probably de&s;troy, with it, what is much
more valuable, the indu&s;try, morals, and numbers of
its people. The fluid in this ca&s;e, rai&s;ed to too great
a height, bur&s;ts and de&s;troys the ve&s;&s;el that contains
it; and mixing it&s;elf with the &s;urrounding element,
&s;oon falls to its proper level.</P>
<P>So little are we commonly acquainted with this
principle, that tho' all hi&s;torians agree in relating uni|$$ormly
&s;o recent an event, as the immen&s;e trea&s;ure
ama&s;&s;ed by HARRY VII. (which they make amount
to 1,700,000 pounds,) we rather reject their concurring
te&s;timony, than admit of a fact which agrees &s;o ill
<PB N="97" REF="100">
with our inveterate prejudices. 'Tis indeed probable,
that that &s;um might be three fourths of all the money
in ENGLAND. But where is the difficulty that &s;uch
a &s;um might be ama&s;&s;ed in twenty years, by a cunning,
rapacious, frugal, and almo&s;t arbitrary monarch? Nor
is it probable, that the diminution of circulating mo|ney
was ever &s;en&s;ibly felt by the people, or ever did
them any prejudice. The &s;inking of the prices of
all commodities would immediately replace it, by giv|ing
ENGLAND the advantage in its commerce with all
the neighbouring kingdoms.</P>

<P>WE may learn from STANYAN, that the canton of

is a &s;um hoarded of 1,800,000 pounds <HI>Sterling,</HI>
which is at lea&s;t quadruple of what &s;hould naturally

be &s;uppo&s;ed in a country of that extent, &s;oil, and
&s;ituation. On the contrary, there are &s;carce any in|land
provinces in the continent of FRANCE or GER|MANY,
where the inhabitants are at this time &s;o opu|lent,
tho' that canton has va&s;tly increa&s;ed its trea&s;ure
&s;ince 1714, the time when STANYAN wrote his judi|cious

<P>THE account given by APPIAN<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Proem.</NOTE> of the trea&s;ure

to Dr. ARBUTHNOT'S computation. And

<P>FROM the&s;e principles we may learn what judg|ment
we ought to form of tho&s;e numberle&s;s bars, ob|&s;tructions,
and impo&s;ts, which all nations of EUROPE,
and none more than ENGLAND, have put upon trade;
from an exorbitant de&s;ire of ama&s;&s;ing money, which
never will heap up beyond its level, while it circulates;
or from an ill grounded apprehen&s;ion of lo&s;ing their
&s;pecie, which never will &s;ink below it. Could any
thing &s;catter our riches, it would be &s;uch impolitic
contrivances. But this general ill effect, however,
re&s;ults from them, that they deprive neighbouring na|tions
of that free communication and exchange, which
the author of the world has intended, by giving them
&s;oils, climates, and geniu&s;es, &s;o different from each
other.</P>
<P><PB N="101" REF="104">
OUR modern politics embrace the only method of
bani&s;hing money, the u&s;ing paper-credit; they reject
the only method of ama&s;&s;ing it, the practice of hoard|ing;
and they adopt a hundred contrivances, which
&s;erve to no purpo&s;e but to check indu&s;try, and rob
our&s;elves and our neighbours of the common benefits
of art and nature.</P>
<P>ALL texes, however, upon foreign commodities,
are not to be regarded as prejudicial or u&s;ele&s;s, but
tho&s;e only which are founded on the jealou&s;y above|mentioned.
A tax on GERMAN linen encourages
home manufactures, and thereby multiplies our people
and indu&s;try. A tax on brandy increa&s;es the &s;ale of
rum, and &s;upports our &s;outhern colonies. And as
'tis nece&s;&s;ary impo&s;ts &s;hould be levied, for the &s;upport
of government, it may be thought more convenient to
lay them on foreign commodities, which can ea&s;ily be
intercepted at the port, and &s;ubjected to the impo&s;t.
We ought, however, always to remember the maxim
of Dr. SWIFT, That, in the arithmetic of the cu&s;|toms,
two and two make not four, but often make
only one. It can &s;carcely be doubted, but if the
duties on wine were lowered to a third, they would
yield much more to the government than at pre&s;ent:
Our people might thereby afford to drink commonly
a better and more whole&s;ome liquor; and no preju|dice
would en&s;ue to the balance of trade, of which
we are &s;o jealous. The manufacture of ale, beyond
<PB N="102" REF="105">
the agriculture, is but incon&s;iderable, and gives em|ployment
to few hands. The tran&s;port of wine and
corn would not be much inferior.</P>
<P>BUT are there not frequent in&s;tances, you will &s;ay,
of &s;tates and kingdoms, which were formerly rich
and opulent, and are now poor and beggarly? Has
not the money left them, with which they formerly
abounded? I an&s;wer, If they lo&s;e their trade, in|du&s;try,
and people, they cannot expect to keep their
gold and &s;ilver: For the&s;e precious metals will hold
proportion to the former advantages. When LISBON
and AMSTERDAM got the EAST-INDIA trade from VE|NICE
and GENOA, they a$&s;o got the profits and mo|ney
which aro&s;e f$om it. Where the &s;eat of govern|ment
is transferred, where expen&s;ive armies are main|tained
at a di&s;tance, where great funds are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
by foreigners; there naturally follows from the&s;e
cau&s;es a diminution of the &s;pecie. But the&s;e, we
may ob&s;erve, are violent and forcible methods of car|rying
away money, and are in time commonly at|tended
with the tran&s;port of people and indu&s;try. But
where the&s;e remain, and the drain is not continued,
the money always finds its way back again, by a hun|dred
canals, of which we have no notion or &s;u&s;picion.
What immen&s;e trea&s;ures have been &s;pent, by &s;o many
nations, in FLANDERS &s;ince the revolution, in the
cour&s;e of three long wars? More money perhaps
than the half of what is at pre&s;ent in all EUROPE.
<PB N="103" REF="106">
But what has now become of it? Is it in the narrow
compa&s;s of the AUSTRIAN provinces? No, &s;urely:
It has mo&s;t of it returned to the &s;everal countries
whence it came, and has followed that art and in|du&s;try
by which at fir&s;t it was acquired. For above a
thou&s;and years, the money of EUROPE has been flow|ing
to ROME, by an open and &s;en&s;ible current; but
it has been emptied by many &s;ecret and in&s;en&s;ible ca|nals:
And the want of indu&s;try and commerce ren|ders
at pre&s;ent the papal dominions the poore&s;t terri|tory
in all ITALY.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, a government has great rea&s;on to pre|&s;erve
with care its people and its manufactures. Its
money, it may &s;afely tru&s;t to the cour&s;e of human af|fairs,
wihtout fear or jealou&s;y. Or if it ever give at|tention

<P>HAVING endeavoured to remove one &s;pecies of
ill-founded jealou&s;y, which is &s;o prevalent among
commercial nations, it may not be ami&s;s to mention
another, which &s;eems equally groundle&s;s. Nothing
is more u&s;ual, among &s;tates which have made &s;ome
advances in commerce, than to look on the progre&s;s
of their neighbours with a &s;u&s;picious eye, to con&s;ider
all trading &s;tates as their rivals, and to &s;uppo&s;e that it
is impo&s;&s;ible for any of them to flouri&s;h, but at their
expence. In oppo&s;ition to this narrow and malignant
opinion, I will venture to a&s;&s;ert, that the increa&s;e of
riches and commerce in any one nation, in&s;tead of
hurting, commonly promotes the riches and com|merce
of all its neighbours; and that a &s;tate can
&s;carcely carry its trade and indu&s;try very far, where
all the &s;urrounding &s;tates are buried in ignorance,
&s;loth, and barbari&s;m.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="108">
IT is obvious, that the dome&s;tic indu&s;try of a
people cannot be hurt by the greate&s;t pro&s;perity of
their neighbours; and as this branch of commerce is
undoubtedly the mo&s;t important in any exten&s;ive king|dom,
we are &s;o far removed from all rea&s;on of jea|lou&s;y.
But I go farther, and ob&s;erve, that where an
open communication is pre&s;erved among nations, it
is impo&s;&s;ible but the dome&s;tic indu&s;try of every one
mu&s;t receive an increa&s;e from the improvements of
the others. Compare the &s;ituation of GREAT BRI|TAIN
at pre&s;ent, with what it was two centuries ago.
All the arts both of agriculture and manufactures
were then extremely rude and imperfect. Every im|provement
which we have &s;ince made, has ari&s;en from
our imitation of foreigners; and we ought &s;o far to
e&s;teem it happy, that they had previou&s;ly made ad|vances
in arts and ingenuity. But this intercour&s;e is
&s;till upheld to our great advantage: Notwith&s;tanding
the advanced &s;tate of our manufactures, we daily adopt
in every art, the inventions and improvements of our
neighbours. The commodity is fir&s;t imported from
abroad, to our great di&s;content, while we imagine that
it drains us of our money: Afterwards, the art it&s;elf
is gradually imported, to our vi&s;ible advantage: Yet
we continue &s;till to repine, that our neighbours &s;hould
po&s;&s;e&s;s any art, indu&s;try, and invention; forgetting
that had they not fir&s;t in&s;tructed us, we &s;hould have
been at pre&s;ent barbarians; and did they not &s;till con|tinue
their in&s;tructions, the arts mu&s;t fall into a &s;tate
<PB N="107" REF="109">
of languor, and lo&s;e that emulation and novelty
which contribute &s;o much to their advancement.</P>
<P>THE increa&s;e of dome&s;tic indu&s;try lays the founda|tion
of foreign commer$e. Where a great number of
commodities are rai&s;ed and perfected for the home-market,
there will always be found &s;ome which can
be exported with advantage. But if our neighbours
have no art nor cultivation, they cannot take them;
becau&s;e they will have nothing to give in exchange.
In this re&s;pect, &s;tates are in the &s;ame condition as
individuals. A &s;ingle man can &s;carce be indu&s;trious,
where all his fellow-citizens are idle. The riches of
the &s;everal members of a community contribute to in|crea&s;e
my riches, whatever profe&s;&s;ion I may follow.
They con&s;ume the product of my indu&s;try, and afford
me the product of theirs in return.</P>
<P>NOR need any &s;tate entertain apprehen&s;ions, that
their neighbours will improve to &s;uch a degree in
every art and manufacture, as to have no demand
from them. Nature, by giving a diver&s;ity of geniu&s;es,
climates, and &s;oils to different nations, has &s;ecured
their mutual intercour&s;e and commerce, as long
as they all remain indu&s;trious and civilized. Nay,
the more the arts increa&s;e in any &s;tate, the more will
be its demands from its indu&s;trious neighbours. The
inhabitants having become opulent and &s;kilful, de&s;ire
to have every commodity in the utmo&s;t perfection;
<PB N="108" REF="110">
and as they have plenty of commodities to give in ex|change,
they make large importations from every
foreign nation. The indu&s;try of the nations from
whom they import it, receives encouragement: Their
own is al&s;o increa&s;ed, by the &s;ale of the commodities
which they give in exchange.</P>
<P>BUT what if a nation has any &s;taple commodity,
&s;uch as the woollen manufacture is to England? Mu&s;t
not the interfering of their neighbours in that manu|facture
be a lo&s;s to them? I an&s;wer, that when any
commodity is denominated the &s;taple of a kingdom,
it is &s;uppo&s;ed that that kingdom has &s;ome peculiar
and natural advantages for rai&s;ing the commodity;
and if, notwith&s;tanding the&s;e advantages, they lo&s;e
&s;uch a manufactory, they ought to blame their own
idlene&s;s, or bad government, not the indu&s;try of their
neighbours. It ought al&s;o to be con&s;idered, that by
the increa&s;e of indu&s;try among the neighbouring-na|tions,
the con&s;umption of every particular &s;pecies of
commodity is al&s;o increa&s;ed; and though foreign ma|nufactures
interfere with us in the market, the de|mand
for our product may &s;till continue, $word$ even in|crea&s;e.
And even &s;hould it dimini&s;h, ought the con|&s;equence
to be e&s;teemed &s;o fatal? If the &s;pirit of in|du&s;try
be pre&s;erved, it may ea&s;ily be diverted from
one branch to another; and the manufacturers of
wool, for in&s;tance, be employed in linen, &s;ilk, iron,
or any other commodities, for which there appears to
<PB N="109" REF="111">
be a demand. We need not apprehend, that all the
objects of indu&s;try will be exhau&s;ted, or that our ma|nufacturers,
while they remain on an equal footing
with tho&s;e of our neighbours, will be in danger of
wanting employment. The emulation among rival
nations &s;erves rather to keep indu&s;try alive in all of
them: And any people is happier who po&s;&s;e&s;s a va|riety
of manufactures, than if they enjoyed one &s;ingle
great manufactory, in which they are all employed.
Their &s;ituation is le&s;s precarious, and they will feel
le&s;s &s;en&s;ibly tho&s;e revolutions and uncertainties to
which every particular &s;pecies of commerce will always
be expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE only commercial &s;tate which ought to dread
the improvements and indu&s;try of their neighbours,
is &s;uch a one as Holland, which enjoying no extent
of land, nor po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing any native commodity, flou|ri&s;h
only by being the brokers, and factors, and car|riers
of others. Such a people may naturally appre|hend,
that as &s;oon as the neighbouring &s;tates come
to know and pur&s;ue their intere&s;t, they will take into
their own hands the management of their affairs, and
deprive their brokers of that profit, which they for|merly
reaped from it. But though this con&s;equence
may naturally be dreaded, it is very long before it
takes place; and by art and indu&s;try it may be ward|ed
for many generations, if not wholly eluded. The
advantage of &s;uperior &s;tock and corre&s;pondence is &s;o
great, that it is not ea&s;ily overcome; and as all the
<PB N="110" REF="112">

reap a con&s;iderable profit from the flouri&s;hing condi|tion

all their revenues, make not &s;uch a figure in
political tran&s;actions as formerly; but their commerce
is &s;urely equal to what it was in the middle of the
la&s;t century, when they were reckoned among the

<P>WERE our narrow and malignant politics to meet
with &s;ucce&s;s, we &s;hould reduce all our neighbouring

prevails in Morocco and the coa&s;t of Barbary. But
what would be the con&s;equence? They could &s;end
us no commodities: They could take none from us:
Our dome&s;tic commerce it&s;elf would langui&s;h for want
of emulation, example, and in&s;truction: And we our|&s;elves
&s;hould &s;oon fall into the &s;ame abject condition

venture to acknowledge, that not only as a man, but
as a Briti&s;h &s;ubject, I pray for the flouri&s;hing com|merce

<P>IN the whole politics of GREECE, the anxiety with

the PELOPONNESIAN war, as intirely owing
to this principle. And after the decline of ATHENS,
when the THEBANS and LACEDEMONIANS di&s;puted
for &s;overeignty, we find, that the ATHENIANS (as
well as many other republics) threw them&s;elves al|ways
into the lighter &s;cale, and endeavoured to pre|&s;erve
the balance. They &s;upported THEBES again&s;t
SPARTA, till the great victory gained by EPAMI|NONDAS
at LEUCTRA; after which they immediately
went over to the conquered, from genero&s;ity, as they
pretended, but, in reality, from their jealou&s;y of the
conquerors<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">XENOPH. Hi&s;t. GRAEC. lib. 6. &amp; 7.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHOEVER will read DEMOSTHENES'S oration for

upon the fir&s;t ri&s;e of the MACEDONIAN power, this

the alarm thro' all GREECE, and at la&s;t a&s;&s;embled
that confederacy under the banners of ATHENS,
which fought the great and deci&s;ive battle of CHAE|RONEA.</P>
<P>'TIS true, the GRECIAN wars are regarded by hi&s;|torians
as wars of emulation rather than of politics;
and each &s;tate &s;eems to have had more in view the
honour of leading the re&s;t, than any well-grounded
<PB N="113" REF="115">
hopes of authority and dominion. If we con&s;ider, in|deed,
the &s;mall number of inhabitants in any one re|public,
compared to the whole, the great difficulty&punc;
of forming &s;ieges in tho&s;e times, and the extraordi|nary
bravery and di&s;cipline of every freeman among
that noble people; we &s;hall conclude, that the balance
of power was of it&s;elf &s;ufficiently &s;ecured in GREECE,
and needed not to be guarded with that caution which
may be requi&s;ite in other ages. But whether we a&s;|cribe
the &s;hifting &s;ides in all the GRECIAN republics
to <HI>jealous emulation</HI> or <HI>cautious politics,</HI> the effects
were alike, and every prevailing power was &s;ure to
meet with a confederacy again&s;t it, and that often
compo&s;ed of its former friends and allies.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame principle, call it envy or prudence,
which produced the <HI>O&s;traci&s;m</HI> of ATHENS and <HI>Peta|li&s;m</HI>

&s;ame or power overtopped the re&s;t; the &s;ame prin|ciple,
I &s;ay, naturally di&s;covered it&s;elf in foreign po|litics,
and &s;oon rai&s;ed enemies to the leading &s;tate,
however moderate in the exerci&s;e of its authority.</P>
<P>THE PERSIAN monarch was really, in his force, a
petty prince, compared to the GRECIAN republics;
and therefore it behoved him, from views of &s;afety
more than from emulation, to intere&s;t him&s;elf in
their quarrels, and to &s;upport the weaker &s;ide in
every conte&s;t. This was the advice given by ALCI|BIADES
<PB N="114" REF="116">
to TISSAPHERNES<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">THUCYD. lib. 8.</NOTE>, and it prolonged near
a century the date of the PERSIAN empire; till the
neglect of it for a moment, after the fir&s;t appearance
of the a&s;piring genius of PHILIP, brought that lofty
and frail edifice to the ground, with a rapidity of
which there are few in&s;tances in the hi&s;tory of man|kind.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;&s;ors of ALEXANDER &s;howed an infinite
jealou&s;y of the balance of power; a jealou&s;y founded
on true politics and prudence, and which pre&s;erved
di&s;tinct for &s;everal ages the partitions made after the
death of that famous conqueror. The fortune and
ambition of ANTIGONUS<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 20.</NOTE> threatened them anew
with an univer&s;al monarchy; but their combination,
and their victory at IPSUS &s;aved them. And in after
times, we find, that as the Ea&s;tern princes con&s;idered
the GREEKS and MACEDONIANS as the only real mi|litary
force with whom they had any intercour&s;e, they
kept always a watchful eye over that part of the
world. The PTOLEMIES, in particular, &s;upported
fir&s;t ARATUS and the ACHAEANS, and then CLEO|MENES
king of SPARTA, from no other view than as
a counterbalance to the MACEDONIAN monarchs.
For this is the account which POLYBIUS gives of the
EGYPTIAN politics<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 51.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="115" REF="117">
THE rea&s;on why 'tis &s;uppo&s;ed, that the antients
were intirely ignorant of the <HI>balance of power,</HI> &s;eems
to be drawn from the ROMAN hi&s;tory more than the
GRECIAN; and as the tran&s;actions of the former are
generally the mo&s;t familiar to us, we have thence
formed all our conclu&s;ions. It mu&s;t be owned, that
the ROMANS never met with any &s;uch general combi|nation
or confederacy again&s;t them, as might natural|ly
be expected from their rapid conque&s;ts and declared
ambition; but were allowed peaceably to &s;ubdue
their neighbours, one after another, till they extended
their dominion over the whole known world. Not to
mention the fabulous hi&s;tory of their ITALIC wars;
there was, upon HANNIBAL's inva&s;ion of the ROMAN
&s;tate, a very remarkable cri&s;i$, which ought to have
called up the attention of all civilized nations. It
appeared afterwards (nor was it difficult to be ob&s;erv|ed

empire; and yet no prince or &s;tate &s;eems to have
been in the lea&s;t alarmed about the event or i&s;&s;ue of
the quarrel. PHILIP of MACEDON remained neuter,
till he &s;aw the victories of HANNIBAL; and then
mo&s;t imprudently formed an alliance with the con|queror,
upon terms &s;till more imprudent. He &s;tipu|lated,
that he was to a&s;&s;i&s;t the CARTHAGINIAN &s;tate
<PB N="116" REF="118">
in their conque&s;t of ITALY; after which they enga|ged
to &s;end over forces into GREECE, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in
&s;ubduing the GRECIAN commonwealths<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">TITI LIVII lib. 23. cap.33.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE RHODIAN and ACHAEAN republics are much
celebrated by antient hi&s;torians for their wi&s;dom and
found policy; yet both of them a&s;&s;i&s;ted the ROMANS
in their wars again&s;t PHILIP and ANTIOCHUS. And
what may be e&s;teemed &s;till a &s;tronger proof, that this
maxim was not familiarly known in tho&s;e ages; no
antient author has ever remarked the imprudence of
the&s;e mea&s;ures, nor has even blamed that ab&s;urd trea|ty
above mentioned, made by PHILIP with the CAR|THAGINIANS.
Princes and &s;tate&s;men may in all ages
be blinded in their rea&s;onings with regard to events,
beforehand: But 'tis &s;omewhat extraordinary, that
hi&s;torians, afterwards, &s;hould not form a &s;ounder
judgment of them.</P>
<P>MASSINISSA, ATTALUS, PRUSIAS, in &s;atisfying
their private pa&s;&s;ions, were, all of them, the in&s;tru|ments
of the ROMAN greatne&s;s; and never &s;eem to
have &s;u&s;pected, that they were forging their own
chains, while they advanced the conque&s;ts of their
ally. A &s;imple treaty and agreement between MASSI|NISSA
and the CARTHAGINIANS, &s;o much required
by mutual intere&s;t, barred the ROMANS from all en|trance
<PB N="117" REF="119">
into AFRICA, and pre&s;erved liberty to man|kind.</P>
<P>THE only prince we meet with in the ROMAN hi&s;|tory,
who &s;eems to have under&s;tood the balance of
power, is HIERO king of SYRACUSE. Tho' the
ally of ROME, he &s;ent a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the CARTHAGI|NIANS,
during the war of the $auxiliaries: &startq;E&s;teem|ing
it requi&s;ite,&endq; &s;ays POLYBIUS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 1. cap. 83.</NOTE>, &startq;both in

pre&s;erve the ROMAN friend&s;hip, that CARTHAGE
&s;hould be &s;a&s;e; le&s;t by its fall the remaining power
&s;hould be able, without contra&s;t or oppo&s;ition, to
execute every purpo&s;e and undertaking. And
here he acted with great wi&s;dom and prudence.
For that is never, on any account, to be overlook|ed;
nor ought &s;uch a force ever to be thrown into
one hand, as to incapacitate the neighbouring
&s;tates from defending their rights again&s;t it.&endq; Here
is the aim of modern politics pointed out in expre&s;s
terms.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, the maxim of pre&s;erving the balance of
power is founded &s;o much on common &s;en&s;e and ob|vious
rea&s;oning, that 'tis impo&s;&s;ible it could altogether
have e&s;caped antiquity, where we find, in other par|ticulars,
&s;o many marks of deep penetration and di&s;|cernment.
If it was not &s;o generally known and ac|knowledged
<PB N="118" REF="120">
as at pre&s;ent, it had, at lea&s;t an influence
on all the wi&s;er and more experienced princes and po|liticians.
And indeed, even at pre&s;ent, however ge|nerally
known and acknowledged among &s;peculative
rea&s;oners, it has not, in practice, an authority much
more exten&s;ive among tho&s;e who govern the world.</P>
<P>AFTER the fall of the ROMAN empire, the form
of government e&s;tabli&s;hed by the northern conquer|ors,
incapacitated them, in a great mea&s;ure, from far|ther
conque&s;ts, and long maintained each &s;tate in its
proper boundaries. But when va&s;&s;alage and the feu|dal
militia were aboli&s;hed, mankind were anew a|larmed
by the danger of univer&s;al monarchy, from
the union of &s;o many kingdoms and principalities in
the per&s;on of the emperor CHARLES. But the power
of the hou&s;e of AUSTRIA, founded on exten&s;ive but
divided dominions, and their riches, derived chiefly
from mines of gold and &s;ilver, were more likely to
decay, of them&s;elves, from internal defects, than to
overthrow all the bulwarks rai&s;ed again&s;t them. In
le&s;s than a century, the force of that violent and
haughty race was &s;hattered, their opulence di&s;&s;ipated,
their &s;plendour eclip&s;ed. A new power &s;ucceeded,
more formidable to the liberties of EUROPE, po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ing
all the advantages of the former, and labouring
under none of its defects; except a &s;hare of that &s;pi|rit
of bigotry and per&s;ecution, with which the hou&s;e
<PB N="119" REF="121">
of AUSTRIA were &s;o long, and &s;till are &s;o much in|fatuated.</P>
<P>EUROPE
has now, for above a century, remained
on the defen&s;ive again&s;t the greate&s;t force that ever,
perhaps, was formed by the civil or political combina|tion
of mankind. And &s;uch is the influence of the
maxim here treated of, that tho' that ambitious na|tion,
in the five la&s;t general wars, have been victor|ious
in four<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e concluded by the peace of the PYRENEES, NIME|GUEN, RYSWICK, and AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.</NOTE>, and un&s;ucce&s;sful only in one<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">That concluded by the peace of UTRECHT.</NOTE>, they
have not much enlarged their dominions, nor acqui|red
a total a&s;cendant over EUROPE. There remains
rather room to hope, that, by maintaining the re&s;i&s;|tance
&s;ome time, the natural revolutious of human
affairs, together with unfore&s;een events and accidents,
may guard us again&s;t univer&s;al monarchy, and pre|&s;erve
the world from &s;o great an evil.</P>
<P>IN the three la&s;t of the&s;e general wars, BRITAIN
has &s;tood foremo&s;t in the glorious &s;truggle; and &s;he
&s;till maintains her &s;tation, as guardian of the general
liberties of EUROPE, and patron of mankind. Be&s;ide
her advantages of riches and &s;ituation, her people are
animated with &s;uch a national &s;pirit, and are &s;o fully
&s;en&s;ible of the ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ings of their govern|ment,

from a blameable deficiency.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, we &s;eem to have been more po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
with the antient GREEK &s;pirit of jealous emu|lation,
than actuated with the prudent views of mo|dern
politics. Our wars with FRANCE have been be|gun
with ju&s;tice, and even, perhaps from nece&s;&s;ity;
but have always been too far pu&s;hed from ob&s;tinacy
and pa&s;&s;ion. The &s;ame peace which was afterwards
made at RYSWICK in 1697, was offered &s;o early as the
ninety-two; that concluded at UTRECHT in 1712
might have been fini&s;hed on as good conditions at
GERTRUYTENBERG in the eight; and we might
have given at FRANCFORT, in 1743, the &s;ame terms,
which we were glad to accept of at AIX LA-CHA|PELLE
in the forty-eight. Here then we &s;ee, that
above half of our wars with FRANCE, and all our pub|lic
debts, are owing more to our own imprudent ve|hemence,
than to the ambition of our neighbours.</P>
<P>IN the <HI>&s;econd</HI> place, we are &s;o declared in our op|po&s;ition
to FRENCH power, and &s;o alert in defence of
our allies, that they always reckon upon our force as
upon their own; and expecting to carry on war at
our expence, refu&s;e all rea&s;onable terms of accommo|dation.
<PB N="121" REF="123">
<HI>Habent &s;ubjectos, tanquam &s;uos; viles, $word$

made the queen of HUNGARY inflexible in her
terms, and prevented that agreement with PRUSSIA,
which would immediately have re&s;tored the general

<P>IN the <HI>third</HI> place, we are &s;uch true combatants,
that, when once engaged, we lo&s;e all concern for

more prejudicial another way, by begetting, as is
u&s;ual, the oppo&s;ite extreme, and rendering us totally

and even in their downfal, which never can
be very di&s;tant from their e&s;tabli&s;hment. The mili|tary
genius which aggrandized the monarchy, &s;oon
leaves the court, the capital, and the center of &s;uch a

di&s;tance, and intere&s;t &s;o &s;mall a part of the &s;tate. The
antient nobility, who&s;e affections attach them to their
&s;overeign, live all at court; and never will accept of
military employments, which would carry them to
remote and barbarous frontiers, where they are di&s;|tant
both from their plea&s;ure and their fortune. The
arms of the &s;tate mu&s;t, therefore, be tru&s;ted to merce|nary
&s;trangers, without zeal, without attachment,
without honour; ready on every occa&s;ion to turn
them again&s;t the prince, and join each de&s;perate male-content,
who offers pay and plunder. This is the
nece&s;&s;ary progre&s;s of human affairs: Thus human

nature checks it&s;elf in its airy elevations: Thus am|bition
blindly labours for the de&s;truction of the con|queror,
of his family, and of every thing near and
dear to him. The BOURBONS, tru&s;ting to the &s;up|port
of their brave, faithful, and affectionate nobility,
would pu&s;h their advantage, without re&s;erve or limi|tation.
The&s;e, while fired with glory and emulation,
can bear the fatigues and dangers of war; but never

or LITHUANIA, forgot at court, and &s;acri|ficed

approaches the prince. The troops are filled with
CRAVATES and TARTARS, HUSSARS and COSSACS;
intermingled, perhaps, with a few &s;oldiers of fortune

in FRANCE, <HI>That every new tax creates a new

<P>WHEN a tax is laid upon commodities, which are

<PB N="126" REF="127">
that the poor increa&s;e their indu&s;try, perform more

are laid on gradually, and affect not the nece&s;&s;aries of
life, this con&s;equence naturally follows; and 'tis cer|tain,
that &s;uch difficulties often &s;erve to excite the in|du&s;try

indu&s;try of the DUTCH intirely to nece&s;&s;ity, proceed|ing
from their natural di&s;advantages; and illu&s;trates
his doctrine by a very &s;triking compari&s;on with IRE|LAND;
&startq;where,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;by the largene&s;s and
plenty of the &s;oil, and &s;carcity of people, all things
nece&s;&s;ary to life are &s;o cheap, that an indu&s;trious
man, by two days labour, may gain enough to
feed him the re&s;t of the week. Which I take to
be a very plain ground of the lazine&s;s attributed to
the people. For men naturally prefer ea&s;e before
labour, and will not take pains if they can live
idle; tho' when, by nece&s;&s;ity, they have been in|ured
to it, they cannot leave it, being grown a
<PB N="128" REF="129">
cu&s;tom nece&s;&s;ary to their health, and to their very
entertainment. Nor perhaps is the change harder,
from con&s;tant ea&s;e to labour, than from con&s;tant
labour to ea&s;e.&endq; After which the author proceeds
to confirm his doctrine, by enumerating, as above,
the places where trade has mo&s;t flouri&s;hed, in antient
and modern times; and which are commonly ob&s;erv|ed
to be &s;uch narrow confined territories, as beget a
nece&s;&s;ity for indu&s;try.</P>
<P>'TIS always ob&s;erved, in years of &s;carcity, if it be
not extreme, that the poor labour more, and really
live better, than in years of great plenty, when they
indulge them&s;elves in idlene&s;s and riot. I have been
told, by a con&s;iderable manufacturer, that in the year
1740, when bread and provi&s;ions of all kinds were
very dear, his workmen not only made a &s;hift to live,
but paid debts, which they had contracted in former
years, that were much more favourable and abun|dant<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">To this purpo&s;e &s;ee al&s;o E&s;&s;ay I. at the end.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS doctrine, therefore, with regard to taxes,
may be admitted in &s;ome degree: But beware of the
abu&s;e. Exorbitant taxes, like extreme nece&s;&s;ity, de|&s;troy
indu&s;try, by producing de&s;pair; and even be|fore
they reach this pitch, they rai&s;e the wages of the
labourer and manufacturer, and heighten the price of
all commodities. An attentive di&s;intere&s;ted legi&s;lature
<PB N="129" REF="130">
will ob&s;erve the point, when the emolument cea&s;es,
and the prejudice begins: But as the contray cha|racter
is much more common, 'tis to be feared that
taxes, all over EUROPE, are multiplying to &s;uch a
degree, as will intirely cru&s;h all art and indu&s;try; tho',
perhaps, their fir&s;t increa&s;e, together with other cir|cum&s;tances,
might have contributed to the growth of
the&s;e advantages.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t taxes are &s;uch as are levied upon con|&s;umptions,
e&s;pecially tho&s;e of luxury; becau&s;e &s;uch
taxes are le&s;s felt by the people. They &s;eem, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, voluntary; &s;ince a man may chu&s;e how far
he will u&s;e the commodity which is taxed: They are
paid gradually and in&s;en&s;ibly: And being confound|ed
with the natural price of the commodity, they are
&s;carcely perceived by the con&s;umers. Their only di&s;|advantage
is, that they are expen&s;ive in the levying.</P>
<P>TAXES upon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions are levied without ex|pence;
but have every other di&s;advantage. Mo&s;t
&s;tates, however, are obliged to have recour&s;e to them,
in order to &s;upply the deficiencies of the other.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t pernicious of all taxes are tho&s;e
which are arbitrary. They are commonly converted,
by their management, into puni&s;hments on indu&s;try;
and al&s;o, by their unavoidable inequality, are more
grievous than by the real burden which they impo&s;e.
<PB N="130" REF="131">
'Tis &s;urpri&s;ing, therefore, to &s;ee them have place
among any civilized people.</P>
<P>IN general, all poll-taxes, even when not arbitrary,
which they commonly are, may be e&s;teemed danger|ous:
Becau&s;e it is &s;o ea&s;y for the fovereign to add a
little more, and a little more, to the &s;um demanded,
that the&s;e taxes are apt to become altogether oppre&s;|&s;ive
and intolerable. On the other hand, a duty up|on
commodities checks it&s;elf; and a prince will &s;oon
find, that an increa&s;e of the impo&s;t is no increa&s;e of
his revenue. It is not ea&s;y, therefore, for a people
to be altogether ruined by &s;uch taxes.</P>
<P>HISTORIANS inform us, that one of the chief cau|&s;es
of the de&s;truction of the ROMAN &s;tate, was the al|teration
which CONSTANTINE introduced into the fi|nances,
by &s;ub&s;tituting an univer&s;al poll-tax, in lieu
of almo&s;t all the tithes, cu&s;toms, and exci&s;es, which
formerly compo&s;ed the revenue of the <HI>empire.</HI> The
people, in all the provinces, were &s;o grinded and op|pre&s;&s;ed
by the <HI>publicans,</HI> that they were glad to take
refuge under the conquering arms of the barbarians;
who&s;e dominion, as they had fewer nece&s;&s;ities and
le&s;s art, was found preferable to the refined tyranny
of the ROMANS.</P>
<P>THERE is a prevailing opinion, that all taxes,
however levied, fall upon the land at la&s;t. Such an
<PB N="131" REF="132">
opinion may be u&s;eful in BRITAIN, by checking the
landed gentlemen, in who&s;e hands our legi&s;lature is
lodged, and making them pre&s;erve great regard for
trade and indu&s;try. But I mu&s;t confe&s;s, that this
principle, tho' fir&s;t advanced by a celebrated writer,
has &s;o little appearance of rea&s;on, that, were it not for
his authority, it had never been received by any
body. Every man, to be &s;ure, is de&s;irous of pu&s;hing
off from him&s;elf the burden of any tax, which is im|po&s;ed,
and laying it upon others: But as every man
has the &s;ame inclination, and is upon the defen&s;ive;
no &s;et of men can be &s;uppo&s;ed to prevail altogether
in this conte&s;t. And why the landed gentleman
&s;hould be the victim of the whole, and &s;hould not be
able to defend him&s;elf, as well as others are, I can|not
readily imagine. All trade&s;men, indeed, would
willingly prey upon him, and divide him among
them, if they could: But this inclination they al|ways
have, tho' no taxes were levied; and the &s;ame
methods, by which he guards again&s;t the impo&s;ition
of trade&s;men before taxes, will &s;erve him afterwards,
and make them &s;hare the burden with him.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this &s;ubject with ob&s;erving, that
we have, with regard to taxes, an in&s;tance of what
frequently happens in political in&s;titutions, that the
con&s;equences of things are diametrically oppo&s;ite to
what we &s;hould expect on the fir&s;t appearance. 'Tis
regarded as a fundamental maxim of the TURKISH
<PB N="132" REF="133">
government, That the <HI>Grand Signior,</HI> tho' ab&s;olute ma&s;|ter
of the lives and fortunes of each individual, has no
authority to impo&s;e a new tax; and every OTTO|MAN
prince, who has made &s;uch an attempt, either
has been obliged to retract, or has found the fatal
effects of his per&s;everance. One would imagine, that
this prejudice or e&s;tabli&s;hed opinion were the firme&s;t
barrier in the world again&s;t oppre&s;&s;ion; yet 'tis cer|tain,
that its effect is quite contrary. The emperor,
having no regular method of increa&s;ing his revenue,
mu&s;t allow all the ba&s;haws and governors to oppre&s;s
and abu&s;e the &s;ubjects: And the&s;e he &s;queezes after
their return from their government. Whereas, if he
could impo&s;e a new tax, like our EUROPEAN prin|ces,
his intere&s;t would &s;o far be united with that of
his people, that he would immediately feel the bad
effects of the&s;e di&s;orderly levies of money, and would
find, that a pound, rai&s;ed by general impo&s;ition,
would have le&s;s pernicious effects, than a &s;hilling ta|ken
in &s;o unequal and arbitrary a manner.</P>

<P>IT appears to have been the common practice of
antiquity, to make provi&s;ion, in time of peace,
for the nece&s;&s;ities of war, and to hoard up trea&s;ures
before-hand, as the in&s;truments either of conque&s;t or

much le&s;s to borrowing, in times of di&s;order and con|fu&s;ion.

ALEXANDER got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of on the conque&s;t of

right, the &s;cripture al&s;o mentions the trea&s;ure
of HEZEKIAH and the JEWISH princes; as profane
hi&s;tory does that of PHILIP and PERSEUS, kings of
MACEDON. The antient republics of GAUL had
commonly large &s;ums in re&s;erve<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">STRABO, Lib, 4.</NOTE>. Every one knows
the trea&s;ure &s;eized in ROME by JULIUS CAESAR, dur|ing

wi&s;er emperors, AUGUSTUS, TIBERIUS, VESPASIAN,
SEVE$US, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> always di&s;covered the prudent fore|&s;ight,
of &s;aving great &s;ums again&s;t any public exi|gency.</P>
<P>ON
the contrary, our modern expedient, which has
become very general, is to mortgage the public reve|nues,
and to tru&s;t that po&s;terity, during peace, will
pay off the incumbrances contracted during the pre|ceding
war: And they having before their eyes, &s;o
good an example of their wi&s;e fathers, have the &s;ame
prudent reliance on their po&s;terity; who, at la&s;t, from
nece&s;&s;ity more than choice, are obliged to place the
&s;ame confidence in a new po&s;terity. But not to wa&s;te
time in declaiming again&s;t a practice which appears
ruinous, beyond the evidence of an hundred demon|&s;trations;
it &s;eems pretty apparent, that the antient
<PB N="135" REF="136">
maxims are, in this re&s;pect, much more prudent than
the modern; even though the latter had been confined
within &s;ome rea&s;onable bounds, and had ever, in any
in&s;tance, been attended with &s;uch frugality, in time
of peace, as to di&s;charge the debts incurred by an ex|pen&s;ive
war. For why &s;hould the ca&s;e be &s;o very dif|ferent
between the public and an individual, as to
make us e&s;tabli&s;h &s;uch different maxims of conduct for
each? If the funds of the former be greater, its
nece&s;&s;ary expences are proportionably larger; if its
re&s;ources be more numerous, they are not infinite;
and as its frame &s;hould be calculated for a much lon|ger
duration, than the date of a &s;ingle life, or even
of a family, it &s;hould embrace maxims, large, durable,
and generous, &s;uitable to the &s;uppo&s;ed extent of its
exi&s;tence. To tru&s;t to chances and temporary ex|pedients,
is, indeed, what the nece&s;&s;ity of human af|fairs
frequently reduces us to; but whoever voluntarily
depend on &s;uch re&s;ources, have not nece&s;&s;ity, but their
own folly, to accu&s;e for their misfortunes, when any
&s;uch befal them.</P>
<P>IF the abu&s;es of trea&s;ures be dangerous, either by
engaging the &s;tate in ra&s;h enterprizes, or making it
neglect military di&s;cipline, in confidence of its riches;
the abu&s;es of mortgaging are more certain and inevi|table;
poverty, impotence, and &s;ubjection to foreign
powers.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">
ACCORDING to modern policy, war is attended
with every de&s;tructive circum&s;tance; lo&s;s of men, in|crea&s;e
of taxes, decay of commerce, di&s;&s;ipation of
money, plunder by &s;ea and land. According to an|tient
maxims, the opening of the public trea&s;ure, as
it produced an uncommon affluence of gold and &s;il|ver,
&s;erved as a temporary encouragement to indu&s;try,
and atoned, in &s;ome degree, for the inevitable cala|mities
of war.</P>
<P>WHAT then &s;hall we &s;ay to the new paradox, That
public incumbrances are, of them&s;elves, advantage|ous,
independent of the nece&s;&s;ity of contracting them;
and that any &s;tate, even though it were not pre&s;&s;ed by
a foreign enemy, could not po&s;&s;ibly have embraced a
wi&s;er expedient for promoting commerce and riches,
than to create funds, and debts, and taxes, without
limitation? Di&s;cour&s;es, &s;uch as the&s;e, might naturally
have pa&s;&s;ed for trials of wit among rhetoricians, like
the panegyrics on folly and a fever, on BUSIRIS and
NERO, had we not &s;een &s;uch ab&s;urd maxims patro|nized
by great mini&s;ters, and by a whole party
among us. And the&s;e puzzling arguments, (for they
de&s;erve not the name of &s;pecious) though they could
not be the foundation of Lord ORFORD's conduct,
for he had more &s;en&s;e; &s;erved at lea&s;t to keep his
partizans in countenance, and perplex the under&s;tand|ing

<P><PB N="137" REF="138">
LET us examine the con&s;equences of public debts,
both in our dome&s;tic management, by their influence
on commerce and indu&s;try; and in our foreign tran&s;|actions,
by their effect on wars and negotiations.</P>
<P>THERE is a word, which is here in the mouth of
every body, and which, I find, has al&s;o got abroad,
and is much employed by foreign writers<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">MELON, DU TOT, LAW, in the pamphlets publi&s;hed in FRANCE.</NOTE>, in imita|tion
of the ENGLISH; and this is, CIRCULATION.
This word &s;erves as an account of every thing; and
though I confe&s;s, that I have &s;ought for its meaning
in the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, ever &s;ince I was a &s;chool-boy,
I have never yet been able to di&s;cover it. What
po&s;&s;ible advantage is there which the nation can reap
by the ea&s;y transference of &s;tock from hand to hand?
Or is there any parallel to be drawn from the circula|tion
of other commodities, to that of chequer-notes
and INDIA bonds? Where a manufacturer has a quick
&s;ale of his goods to the merchant, the merchant to the
&s;hopkeeper, the &s;hopkeeper to his cu&s;tomers; this en|livens
indu&s;try, and gives new encouragement to the
fir&s;t dealer or the manufacturer, and all his trade&s;men,
and makes them produce more and better commodi|ties
of the &s;ame &s;pecies. A &s;tagnation is here perni|cious,
wherever it happens; becau&s;e it operates back|wards,
and &s;tops or benumbs the indu&s;trious hand in
<PB N="138" REF="139">
its production of what is u&s;eful to human life. But
what production we owe to CHANGE-ALLEY, or even
what con&s;umption, except that of coffee, and pen, ink,
and paper, I have not yet learned; nor can one fore|&s;ee
the lo&s;s or decay of any one beneficial commerce
or commodity, though that place and all its inhabi|tants
were for ever buried in the ocean.</P>
<P>BUT though this term has never been explained by
tho&s;e who in&s;i&s;t &s;o much on the advantages that re&s;ult
from a circulation, there &s;eems, however, to be &s;ome
benefit of a &s;imilar kind, ari&s;ing from our incum|brances:
As, indeed, what human evil is there, which
is not attended with &s;ome advantage? This we &s;hall
endeavour to explain, that we may e&s;timate the weight
which we ought to allow it.</P>
<P>PUBLIC &s;ecurities are with us become a kind of
money, and pa&s;s as readily at the current price as
gold or &s;ilver. Where-ever any profitable undertaking
offers it&s;elf, however expen&s;ive, there are never want|ing
hands enough to embrace it; nor need a trader,
who has &s;ums in the public &s;tocks, fear to launch out
into the mo&s;t exten&s;ive trade; &s;ince he is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of
funds, which will an&s;wer the mo&s;t &s;udden demand
that can be made upon him. No merchant thinks it
nece&s;&s;ary to keep by him any con&s;iderable ca&s;h. Bank-&s;tock,
or INDIA bonds, e&s;pecially the latter, &s;erve all
the &s;ame purpo&s;es; becau&s;e he can di&s;po&s;e of them, or
<PB N="139" REF="140">
pledge them to a banker, in a quarter of an hour;
and at the &s;ame time they are not idle, even when in
his &s;critoire, but bring him in a con&s;tant revenue. In
&s;hort, our national debts furni&s;h merchants with a &s;pe|cies
of money, that is continually multiplying in their
hands, and produces &s;ure gain, be&s;ides the profits of
their commerce. This mu&s;t enable them to trade
upon le&s;s profit. The &s;mall profit of the merchant
renders the commodity cheaper, cau&s;es a greater con|&s;umption,
quickens the labour of the common people,
and helps to &s;pread arts and indu&s;try through the
whole &s;ociety.</P>
<P>THERE are al&s;o, we may ob&s;erve, in ENGLAND,
and in all &s;tates, which have both commerce and pub|lic
debts, a &s;et of men, who are half-merchants, half-&s;tock-holders,
and may be &s;uppo&s;ed willing to trade
for &s;mall profits; becau&s;e commerce is not their prin|cipal
or &s;ole &s;upport, and their revenues in the funds
are a &s;ure re&s;ource for them&s;elves and their families.
Were there no funds, great merchants would have no
expedient for realizing or &s;ecuring any part of their
profit, but by making purcha&s;es of land; and land has
many di&s;advantages in compari&s;on of funds. Requiring
more care and in&s;pection, it divides the time and at|tention
of the merchant; upon any tempting offer or
extraordinary accident in trade, it is not &s;o ea&s;ily con|verted
into money; and as it attracts too much, both
<PB N="140" REF="141">
by the many natural plea&s;ures it affords, and the au|thority
it gives, it &s;oon converts the citizen into the
country gentleman. More men, therefore, with large
&s;tocks and incomes, may naturally be &s;uppo&s;ed to
continue in trade, where there are public debts: and
this, it mu&s;t be owned, is of &s;ome advantage to com|merce,
by dimini&s;hing its profits, promoting circula|tion,
and encouraging indu&s;try<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">On this head, I &s;hall ob&s;erve, without interrupting the thread of the argument, that the multiplicity of our public debts &s;erves rather to &s;ink the intere&s;t, and that the more the government borrows, the cheaper may they expect to borrow; contrary to fir&s;t appearance, and contrary to common opinion. The profits of trade have an influence on intere&s;t. See E&s;&s;ay IV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT, in oppo&s;ition to the&s;e two favourable circum|&s;tances,
perhaps of no very great importance, weigh
the many di&s;advantages which attend our public
debts, in the whole <HI>interior</HI> oeconomy of the &s;tate:
You will find no compari&s;on between the ill and the
good which re&s;ult from them.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> 'Tis certain, that national debts cau&s;e a
mighty confluence of people and riches to the capital,
by the great &s;ums which are levied in the provinces
to pay the intere&s;t of tho&s;e debts; and perhaps, too,
by the advantages in trade above mentioned, which
they give the merchants in the capital above the re&s;t
of the kingdom. The que&s;tion is, Whether, in our
<PB N="141" REF="142">
ca&s;e, it be for the public intere&s;t, that &s;o many pri|vileges
&s;hould be conferred on LONDON, which has
already arrived at &s;uch an enormous &s;ize, and &s;eems
&s;till increa&s;ing? Some men are apprehen&s;ive of the
con&s;equences. For my part, I cannot forbear think|ing,
that tho' the head is undoubtedly too big for
the body, yet that great city is &s;o happily &s;ituated,
that its exce&s;&s;ive bulk cau&s;es le&s;s inconvenience than
even a &s;maller capital to a greater kingdom. There
is more difference between the prices of all provi&s;ions
in PARIS and LANGUEDOC, than between tho&s;e in
LONDON and YORKSHIRE.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> PUBLIC &s;tocks, being a kind of paper-credit,
have all the di&s;advantages attending that &s;pe|cies
of money. They bani&s;h gold and &s;ilver from the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable commerce of the &s;tate, reduce them
to common circulation, and by that means render all
provi&s;ions and labour dearer than otherwi&s;e they
would be.</P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THE taxes which are levied to pay the
intere&s;ts of the&s;e debts, are a check upon indu&s;try,
heighten the price of labour, and are an oppre&s;&s;ion on
the poorer &s;ort.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> As foreigners po&s;&s;e&s;s a &s;hare of our na|tional
funds, they render the public, in a manner, tri|butary
to them, and may in time occa&s;ion the tran&s;|port
of our people and our indu&s;try.</P>
<P><PB N="142" REF="143">
<HI>Fifthly,</HI> THE greate&s;t part of public &s;tock being
always in the hands of idle people, who live on their
revenue, our funds give great encouragement to an
u&s;ele&s;s and inactive life.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the injury which ari&s;es to commerce and
indu&s;try from our public funds, will appear, upon ba|lancing
the whole, very con&s;iderable, it is trivial, in
compari&s;on of the prejudice which re&s;ults to the &s;tate
con&s;idered as a body politic, which mu&s;t &s;upport it&s;elf
in the &s;ociety of nations, and have various tran&s;actions
with other &s;tates, in wars and negotiations. The ill,
there, is pure and unmixed, without any favourable
circum&s;tance to atone for it: and 'tis an ill too of a
nature the highe&s;t and mo&s;t important.</P>
<P>WE have, indeed, been told, that the public is no
weaker upon account of its debts; &s;ince they are mo&s;t|ly
due among our&s;elves, and bring as much property
to one as they take from another. 'Tis like transfer|ring
money from the right hand to the left; which
leaves the per&s;on neither richer nor poorer than before.
Such loo&s;e rea&s;onings and &s;pecious compari&s;ons will
always pa&s;s, where we judge not upon principles. I
a&s;k, Is it po&s;&s;ible, in the nature of things, to overbur|then
a nation with taxes, even where the &s;overeign
re&s;ides among them? The very doubt &s;eems extra|vagant;
&s;ince 'tis requi&s;ite in every commonwealth,
that there be a certain proportion ob&s;erved between
<PB N="143" REF="144">
the laborious and the idle part of it. But if all our
pre&s;ent taxes be mortgaged, mu&s;t we not invent new
ones? And may not this matter be carried to a length
that is ruinous and de&s;tructive?</P>
<P>IN every nation, there are always &s;ome methods of
levying money more ea&s;y than others, &s;uitable to the
way of living of the poeple, and the commodities
they make u&s;e of. In BRITAIN, the exci&s;es upon
malt and beer afford a very large revenue; becau&s;e
the operations of malting and brewing are very tedi|ous,
and are impo&s;&s;ible to be concealed; and at the
&s;ame time, the&s;e commodities are not &s;o ab&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary to life, as that the rai&s;ing their price would
very much affect the poorer &s;ort. The&s;e taxes being
all mortgaged, what difficulty to find new ones! what
vexation and ruin of the poor!</P>
<P>DUTIES upon con&s;umptions are more equal and
ea&s;y than tho&s;e upon po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. What a lo&s;s to the
public, that the former are all exhau&s;ted, and that we
mu&s;t have recour&s;e to the more grievous method of
levying taxes!</P>
<P>WERE all the proprietors of land only &s;tewards to
the public, mu&s;t not nece&s;&s;ity force them to practi&s;e
all the arts of oppre&s;&s;ion u&s;ed by &s;tewards, where the
ab&s;ence or negligence of the proprietor render them
&s;ecure again&s;t enquiry?</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="145">
IT will &s;carce be a&s;&s;erted, that no bounds ought
ever to be &s;et to national debts; and that the pub|lic
would be no weaker, were twelve or fifteen &s;hil|lings
in the pound, land-tax, mortgaged, with all the
pre&s;ent cu&s;toms and exci&s;es. There is &s;omething
therefore in the ca&s;e, be&s;ide the mere transferring of
property from one hand to another. In 500 years,
the po&s;terity of tho&s;e now in the coaches, and of
tho&s;e upon the boxes, will probably have changed
places, without affecting the public by the&s;e revo|lutions.</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, that there is a &s;trange &s;upinene&s;s,
from long cu&s;tom, crept into all ranks of men, with
regard to public debts, not unlike what divines &s;o ve|hemently
complain of with regard to their religious
doctrines. We all own, that the mo&s;t &s;anguine ima|gination
cannot hope, either that this or any future
mini&s;try will be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;uch rigid and &s;teady fru|gality,
as to make any con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the
payment of our debts; or that the &s;ituation of fo|reign
affairs will, for any long time, allow them lei|&s;ure
and tranquility for &s;uch an undertaking<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In times of peace and &s;ecurity, when alone it is po&s;&s;ible to pay debt, the monied intere&s;t are aver&s;e to receive partial pay|ments, which they know not how to di&s;po&s;e of to advantage; and the landed intere&s;t are aver&s;e to continue the taxes requi&s;ite for that purpo&s;e. Why therefore &s;hould a mini&s;ter per&s;evere in a mea&s;ure &s;o di&s;agreeable to all parties?

impo&s;&s;ible to form &s;ome conjectural &s;olution of. The
events here will depend little upon the contingencies
of battles, negotiations, intrigues and factions. There
&s;eems to be a natural progre&s;s of things, which may
guide our rea&s;oning. As it would have required but
a moderate &s;hare of prudence, when we fir&s;t began
this practice of mortgaging, to have foretold, from
the nature of men and of mini&s;ters, that things would
nece&s;&s;arily be carried to the length we &s;ee; &s;o now
that they have at la&s;t happily reached it, it may not
be difficult to gue&s;s at the con&s;equences. It mu&s;t, in|deed,
be one of the&s;e two events; either the nation
mu&s;t de&s;troy public credit, or public credit will de|&s;troy
the nation. 'Tis impo&s;&s;ible they can both &s;ub|&s;i&s;t,
after the manner they have been hitherto mana|ged,
in this, as well as in &s;ome other nations.</P>
<P>THERE was, indeed, a &s;cheme for the payment of
our debts, which was propo&s;ed by an excellent citi|zen,
<PB N="146" REF="147">
Mr. HUTCHINSON, above thirty years ago, and
which was much approved of by &s;ome men of &s;en&s;e,
but never was likely to take effect. He a&s;&s;erted, that
there was a fallacy in imagining that the public owed
this debt; for that really every individual owed a
proportional &s;hare of it, and paid, in his taxes, a pro|portional
&s;hare of the intere&s;t, be&s;ide the expences of
levying the&s;e taxes. Had we not better, then, &s;ays
he, make a proportional di&s;tribution of the debt a|mong
us, and each of us contribute a &s;um &s;uitable to
his property, and by that means di&s;charge at once all
our funds and public mortgages? He &s;eems not to
have con&s;idered, that the laborious poor pay a con&s;i|derable
part of the taxes by their annual con&s;umptions,
tho' they could not advance, at once, a proportional
part of the &s;um required. Not to mention, that pro|perty
in money and &s;tock in trade might ea&s;ily be
concealed or di&s;gui&s;ed; and that vi&s;ible property in
lands and hou&s;es would really at la&s;t an&s;wer for the
whole: An inequality and oppre&s;&s;ion which never
would be &s;ubmitted to. But tho' this project is never
likely to take place; 'tis not altogether improbable,
that when the nation become heartily &s;ick of their
debts, and are cruelly oppre&s;&s;ed by them, &s;ome da|ring
projector may ari&s;e with vi&s;ionary &s;chemes for
their di&s;charge. And as public credit will begin, by
that time, to be a little frail, the lea&s;t touch will
<PB N="147" REF="148">
de&s;troy it, as happened in FRANCE; and in this man|ner
it will <HI>die of the doctor</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Some neighbouring &s;tates practi&s;e an ea&s;y expedient, by which they lighten their public debts. The FRENCH have a cu&s;tom (as the ROMANS formerly had) of augmenting their money; and this the nation has been &s;o much familiarized to, that it hurts not public credit, tho' it be really cutting off at once, by an edict, &s;o much of their debts. The DUTCH di|mini&s;h the intere&s;t, without the con&s;ent of their creditors; or, which is the &s;ame thing, they arbitrarily tax the funds as well as other property. Could we practi&s;e either of the&s;e methods, we need never be oppre&s;&s;ed by the national debt; and 'tis not im|po&s;&s;ible but one of the&s;e, or &s;ome other method, may, at all ad|ventures, be tried, on the augmentation of our incumbrances and difficulties. But people in this country are &s;o good rea&s;on|ers upon whatever regards their intere&s;t, that &s;uch a practice will deceive no body; and public credit will probably tumble at once by &s;o dangerous a trial.</NOTE>:</P>
<P>BUT 'tis more probable, that the breach of nation|al
faith will be the nece&s;&s;ary effect of wars, defeats,
misfortunes, and public calamities, or even perhaps
of victories and conque&s;ts. I mu&s;t confe&s;s, when I
&s;ee princes and &s;tates fighting and quarrelling, amid&s;t
their debts, funds, and public mortgages, it always
brings to my mind a match of cudgel-playing fought
in a <HI>China</HI> &s;hop. How can it be expected, that &s;o|vereigns
will &s;pare a &s;pecies of property, which is per|nicious
to them&s;elves and to the public, when they
have &s;o little compa&s;&s;ion on lives and properties,
which are u&s;eful to both? Let the time come (and
<PB N="148" REF="149">
&s;urely it will come) when the new funds, created for
the exigencies of the year, are not &s;ub&s;cribed to, and
rai&s;e not the money projected. Suppo&s;e, either that
the ca&s;h of the nation is exhau&s;ted; or that our faith,
which has been hitherto &s;o ample, begins to fail us.
Suppo&s;e, that, in this di&s;tre&s;s, the nation is threaten|ed
with an inva&s;ion,; a rebellion is &s;u&s;pected or broke
out at home; a &s;quadron cannot be equipped for
want of pay, victuals, or repairs; or even a foreign
&s;ub&s;idy cannot be advanced. What mu&s;t a prince or
mini&s;ter do in &s;uch an emergence? The right of &s;elf-pre&s;ervation
is analienable in every individual, much
more in every community. And the folly of our
&s;late&s;men mu&s;t then be greater than the folly of tho&s;e
who fir&s;t contracted debt, or, what is more, than that
of tho&s;e who tru&s;ted, or continue to tru&s;t this &s;ecurity,
if the&s;e &s;tate&s;men have the means of &s;afety in their
hands, and do not employ them. The funds, cre|ated
and mortgaged, will, by that time, bring in a
large yearly revenue, &s;ufficient for the defence and &s;e|curity
of the nation: Money is perhaps lying in the
exchequer, ready for the di&s;charge of the quarterly
intere&s;t: Nece&s;&s;ity calls, fear urges, rea&s;on exhorts,
compa&s;&s;ion alone exclaims: The money will immedi|ately
be &s;eized for the current &s;ervice, under the mo&s;t
&s;olemn prote&s;tations, perhaps, of being immediately
replaced. But no more is requi&s;ite. The whole fa|bric,
already tottering, falls to the ground, and bu|ries
thou&s;ands in its ruins. And this, I think, may

be called the <HI>natural death</HI> of public credit: For to
this period it tends as naturally as an animal body to
its di&s;&s;olution and de&s;truction<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">So great dupes are the generality of mankind, that, not|with&s;tanding &s;uch a violent &s;hock to public credit, as a volun|tary bankruptcy in ENGLAND would occa&s;ion, it would not probably be long, ere credit would again revive in as flouri&s;hing a condition as before. The pre&s;ent king of FRANCE, during the late war, borrowed money at lower intere&s;t than ever his grandfather did; and as low as the BRITISH parliament, com|paring the natural rate of intere&s;t in both kingdoms. And tho' men are commonly more governed by what they have &s;een, than by what they fore&s;ee, with whatever certainty; yet promi&s;es, prote&s;tations, fair appearances, with the allurements of pre&s;ent intere&s;t, have &s;uch powerful intere&s;t as few are able to re&s;i&s;t. Mankind are, in all ages, caught by the &s;ame baits: The &s;ame tricks, played over and over again, &s;till trepan them. The heights of popularity and patrioti&s;m are &s;till the beaten road to power and tyranny; flattery to treachery; &s;tanding armies to arbitrary government; and the glory of God to the temporal in|tere&s;t of the clergy. The fear of an everla&s;ting de&s;truction of credit, allowing it to be an evil, is a needle&s;s bugbear, A pru|dent man, in reality, would rather lend to the public immedi|ately after they had taken a &s;punge to their debts, as at pre&s;ent; as much as an opulent knave, even tho' one could not force him to pay, is a preferable debtor to an hone&s;t bankrupt: For the former, in order to carry on bu&s;ine&s;s, may find it his intere&s;t to di&s;charge his debts, where they are not exorbitant: The latter has it not in his power. The rea&s;oning of TACITUS, <HI>Hi&s;t. lib.</HI> 3. as it is eter|nally true, is very applicable to our pre&s;ent ca&s;e. <HI>Sed vulgus ad magnitudinem beneficiorum ade$at: Stulti&s;&s;imus qui&s;que pecuniis mer|cabatur: Apud &s;apientes ca&s;&s;a habebantur, quae neque dari neque accipi, &s;aiva republica, poterant.</HI> The public is a debtor, whom no man can oblige to pay.

very u&s;eful or popular, to prohibit for ever its abro|gation

proceeded from an univer&s;al &s;en&s;e of the levity and

<P>II. A WHEEL within a wheel, &s;uch as we ob&s;erve
in the GERMAN empire, is con&s;idered by Lord
SHAFTESBURY<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">E&s;&s;ay on the freedom of wit and humour, part 3. &sect; 2.</NOTE> as an ab&s;urdity in politics: But what
mu&s;t we &s;ay to two equal wheels, which govern the
&s;ame political machine, without any mutual check,
controul, or &s;ubordination; and yet pre&s;erve the
greate&s;t harmony and concord? To e&s;tabli&s;h two
di&s;tinct legi&s;latures, each of which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es full and
<PB N="159" REF="160">
ab&s;olute authority within it&s;elf, and &s;tands in no need
of the other's a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in order to give validity to its
acts; this may appear, beforehand, altogether im|practicable,
as long as men are actuated by the pa&s;|&s;ions
of ambition, emulation, and avarice, which
have been hitherto their chief governing principles.
And &s;hould I a&s;&s;ert, that the &s;tate I have in my eye was
divided into two di&s;tinct factions, each of which pre|dominated
in a di&s;tinct legi&s;lature, and yet produced
no cla&s;hing in the&s;e independent powers; the &s;uppo|&s;ition
may appear almo&s;t incredible. And if, to aug|ment
the paradox, I &s;hould affirm, that this disjoint|ed,
irregular government, was the mo&s;t active, tri|umphant,
and illu&s;trious commonwealth, that ever
yet appeared on the &s;tage of the world; I &s;hould cer|tainly
be told, that &s;uch a political chimera was as ab|&s;urd
as any vi&s;ion of the poets. But there is no need
for &s;earching long, in order to prove the reality of the
foregoing &s;uppo&s;itions: For this was actually the
ca&s;e with the ROMAN republic.</P>
<P>THE legi&s;lative power was there lodged both in
the <HI>comitia centuriata</HI> and <HI>comitia tributa.</HI> In the for|mer,
'tis well known, the people voted according to
their <HI>cen&s;us;</HI> &s;o that when the fir&s;t cla&s;s was unani|mous,
tho' it contained not, perhaps, the hundredth
part of the commonwealth, it determined the whole;
and, with the authority of the &s;enate, e&s;tabli&s;hed a
law. In the latter, every vote was alike; and as
<PB N="160" REF="161">
the authority of the &s;enate was not there requi&s;ite,
the lower people intirely prevailed, and gave law to
the whole &s;tate. In all party-divi&s;ions, at fir&s;t be|tween
the PATRICIANS and PLEBEIANS, afterwards
between the nobles and the people, the intere&s;t of the
Ari&s;tocracy was predominant in the fir&s;t legi&s;lature;
that of the Democracy in the &s;econd: The one could
always de&s;tory what the other had e&s;tabli&s;hed: Nay,
the one, by a &s;udden and unfore&s;een motion, might
take the &s;tart of the other, and totally annihilate its
rival, by a vote, which, from the nature of the con|&s;titution,
had the full authority of a law. But no &s;uch
conte&s;t or &s;truggle is ob&s;erved in the hi&s;tory of ROME:
No in&s;tance of a quarrel between the&s;e two legi&s;|latures;
tho' many between the parties that governed
in each. Whence aro&s;e this concord, which may &s;eem
&s;o extraordinary?</P>
<P>THE legi&s;lature e&s;tabli&s;hed at ROME, by the autho|rity
of SERVIUS TULLIUS, was the <HI>comitia centuri|ata,</HI>
which, after the expul&s;ion of the king, render|ed
the government, for &s;ome time, altogether ari&s;to|cratical.
But the people, having numbers and force
on their &s;ide, and being elated with frequent con|que&s;ts
and victories in their foreign wars, always pre|vailed
when pu&s;hed to extremities, and fir&s;t extorted
from the &s;enate the magi&s;tracy of the tribunes, and
then the legi&s;lative power of the <HI>comitia tributa.</HI> It
then behoved the nobles to be more careful than ever
<PB N="161" REF="162">
not to provoke the people. For be&s;ide the force
which the latter were always po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, they had
now got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of legal authority, and could in|&s;tantly
break in pieces any order or in&s;titution which
directly oppo&s;ed them. By intrigue, by influence,
by money, by combination, and by the re&s;pect paid
their character, the nobles might often prevail, and
direct the whole machine of government: But had
they openly &s;et their <HI>comitia centuriata</HI> in oppo&s;ition
to the <HI>tributa,</HI> they had &s;oon lo&s;t the advantage of that
in&s;titution, together with their con&s;uls, praetors, e|diles,
and all the magi&s;trates elected by it. But the
<HI>comitia tributa,</HI> not having the &s;ame rea&s;on for re|&s;pecting
the <HI>centuriata,</HI> frequently repealed laws fa|vourable
to the Ari&s;tocracy: They limited the autho|rity
of the nobles, protected the people from oppre&s;|&s;ion,
and controlled the actions of the &s;enate and
magi&s;tracy. The <HI>centuriata</HI> found it convenient al|ways
to &s;ubmit; and tho' equal in authority, yet be|ing
inferior in power, dur&s;t never directly give any
&s;hock to the other legi&s;lature, either by repealing its
laws, or e&s;tabli&s;hing laws, which, it fore&s;aw, would
&s;oon be repealed by it.</P>
<P>NO in&s;tance is found of any oppo&s;ition or &s;truggle
between the&s;e <HI>comitia;</HI> except one &s;light attempt of
this kind, mentioned by APPIAN in the third book
of his civil wars. MARK ANTHONY, re&s;olving to
deprive DECIMUS BRUTUS of the government of
<PB N="162" REF="163">
CISALPINE GAUL, railed in the <HI>Forum,</HI> and called
one of the <HI>comitia,</HI> in order to prevent the meeting
of the other, which had been ordered by the &s;enate.
But affairs were then fallen into &s;uch confu&s;ion, and
the ROMAN con&s;titution was &s;o near its final di&s;&s;o|lution,
that no inference can be drawn from &s;uch an
expedient. This conte&s;t, be&s;ides, was founded more
on from than party. It was the &s;enate who ordered
the <HI>comitia tributa,</HI> that they might ob&s;truct the
meeting of the <HI>centuriata,</HI> which, by the con&s;titution,
or at lea&s;t forms of the government, could alone di&s;|po&s;e
of provinces.</P>
<P>CICERO was recalled by the <HI>comitia centuriata,</HI> tho'
bani&s;hed by the <HI>tributa,</HI> that is, by a <HI>plebi&s;citum.</HI> But
his bani&s;hment, we may ob&s;erve, never was con&s;idered
as a legal deed, ari&s;ing from the free choice and incli|nation
of the people. It was always a&s;cribed to the
violence alone of CLODIUS, and the di&s;orders intro|duced
by him into the government.</P>
<P>III. THE <HI>third</HI> cu&s;tom which we propo&s;ed to ob|&s;erve,
regards ENGLAND; and tho' it be not &s;o im|portant
as tho&s;e which we have pointed out in
ATHENS and ROME, it is no le&s;s &s;ingular and re|markable.
'Tis a maxim in politics, which we rea|dily
admit as undi&s;puted and univer&s;al, That a power,
however great, when granted by law to an eminent
magi&s;trate, is not &s;o dangerous to liberty, as an au|thority,
<PB N="163" REF="164">
however incon&s;iderable, which he acquires
from violence and u&s;urpation. For, be&s;ides that the
law always limits every power which it be&s;tows, the
very receiving it as a conce&s;&s;ion e&s;tabli&s;hes the autho|rity
whence it is derived, and pre&s;erves the harmony
of the con&s;titution. By the &s;ame right that one pre|rogative
is a&s;&s;umed without law, another may al&s;o
be claimed, and another, with &s;till greater facility;
while the fir&s;t u&s;urpations both &s;erve as precedents to
the following, and give force to maintain them.
Hence the heroi&s;m of HAMPDEN, who &s;u&s;tained the
whole violence of royal pro&s;ecution, rather than pay
a tax of twenty &s;hillings not impo&s;ed by parliament;
hence the care of all ENGLISH partriots to guard
again&s;t the fir&s;t encroachments of the crown; and
hence alone the exi&s;tence, at this day, of ENGLISH
liberty.</P>
<P>THERE is, however, one occa&s;ion, where the par|liament
has departed from this maxim; and that is,
in the <HI>pre&s;&s;ing of &s;eamen.</HI> The exerci&s;e of an illegal
power is here tacitly permitted in the crown; and
tho' it has frequently been under deliberation, how
that power might be rendered legal, and granted, un|der
proper re&s;trictions to the &s;overeign, no &s;afe expe|dient
could ever be propo&s;ed for that purpo&s;e, and the
danger to liberty always appeared greater from law
than from u&s;urpation. While this power is exerci&s;ed
to no other end than to man the navy, men willingly
<PB N="164" REF="165">
&s;ubmit to it, from a &s;en&s;e of its u&s;e and nece&s;&s;ity; and
the &s;ailors, who are alone affected by it, find no body
to &s;upport them, in claiming the rights and privileges
which the law grants, without di&s;tinction, to all ENG|LISH
&s;ubjects. But were this power, on any occa|&s;ion,
made an in&s;trument of faction or mini&s;terial ty|ranny,
the oppo&s;ite faction, and indeed all lovers of
their country, would immediately take the alarm, and
&s;upport the injured party; the liberty of ENGLISH|MEN
would be a&s;&s;erted; juries would be implacable;
and the tools of tyranny, acting both again&s;t law and
equity, would meet with the &s;evere&s;t vengeance. On
the other hand, were the parliament to grant &s;uch an
authority, they would probably fall into one of the&s;e
two inconveniencies: They would either be&s;tow it
under &s;o many re&s;trictions as would make it lo&s;e its
effects, by cramping the authority of the crown; or
they would render it &s;o large and comprehen&s;ive, as
might give occa&s;ion to great abu&s;es, for which we
could, in that ca&s;e, have no remedy. The very ille|gality
of the power, at pre&s;ent, prevents its abu&s;es, by
affording &s;o ea&s;y a remedy again&s;t them.</P>
<P>I PRETEND not, by this rea&s;oning, to exclude all
po&s;&s;ibility of contriving a regi&s;ter for &s;eamen, which
might man the navy, without being dangerous to li|berty.
I only ob&s;erve, that no &s;atisfactory &s;cheme of
that nature has yet been propo&s;ed. Rather than ad|opt
any project hitherto invented, we continue a
<PB N="165" REF="166">
practice &s;eemingly the mo&s;t ab&s;urd and unaccountable.
Authority, in times of full internal peace and con|cord,
is armed again&s;t law. A continued and open
u&s;urpation in the crown is permitted, amid&s;t the
greate&s;t jealou&s;y and watchfulne&s;s in the people; nay
proceeding from tho&s;e very principles: Liberty, in a
country of the highe&s;t liberty, is left intirely to its own
defence, without any countenance or protection: The
wild &s;tate of nature is renewed, in one of the mo&s;t ci|vilized
&s;ocieties of mankind: And great violences and
di&s;orders among the people, the mo&s;t humane and the
be&s;t natured, are committed with impunity; while the
one party pleads obedience to the &s;upreme magi&s;trate,
the other the &s;anction of fundamental laws.</P>

<P>THERE is very little ground, either from rea&s;on
or experience, to conclude the univer&s;e enternal
or incorruptible. The continual and rapid motion of
<PB N="168" REF="168">
matter, the violent revolutions with which every part
is agitated, the changes remarked in the heavens, the
plain traces as well as tradition of an univer&s;al deluge,
or general convul&s;ion of the elements; all the&s;e prove
&s;trongly the mortality of this fabric of the world, and
its pa&s;&s;age, by corruption or di&s;&s;olution, from one &s;tate
or order to another. It mu&s;t, therefore, have its in|fancy,
youth, manhood, and old age, as well as each
individual from which it contains; and 'tis probable,
that, in all the&s;e variations, man, equally with every
animal and vegetable, will partake. In the flouri&s;h|ing
age of the world, it may be expected, that the
human &s;pecies &s;hould po&s;&s;e&s;s greater vigour both of
mind and body, more pro&s;perous health, higher &s;pi|rits,
longer life, and a &s;tronger inclination and power
of generation. But if the general &s;y&s;tem of things,
and human &s;ociety of cour&s;e, have any &s;uch gradual
revolutions, they are too &s;low to be di&s;cernible in that
&s;hort period which is comprehended by hi&s;tory and
tradition. Stature and force of body, length of life,
even courage and extent of genius, &s;eem hitherto to
have been naturally, in all ages, pretty much the
&s;ame. The arts and &s;ciences, indeed, have flouri&s;hed
in one period, and have decayed in another: But we
may ob&s;erve, that at the time when they ro&s;e to
greate&s;t perfection among one people, they were per|haps
totally unknown to all the neighbouring nations;
<PB N="169" REF="169">
and tho' they univer&s;ally decayed in one age, yet in a
&s;ucceeding generation they again revived, and diffu&s;ed
them&s;elves over the world. As far, therefore, as ob|&s;ervation
reaches, there is no univer&s;al difference di&s;|cernible
in the human &s;pecies: And tho' it were al|lowed,
that the univer&s;e, like an animal body, had
a natural progre&s;s from infancy to old age; yet as it
mu&s;t &s;till be uncertain whether, at pre&s;ent, it be ad|vancing
to its point of perfection, or declining from
it, we cannot thence pre&s;uppo&s;e any decay in human
nature<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">COLUMELLA &s;ays, lib. 3. cap. 8. that in AEGYPT and AFRICA the bearing of twins was frequent, and even cu&s;tom|ary; <HI>gemini partus familiares, ac paene &s;olennes &s;unt.</HI> If this was true, there is a phy&s;ical difference both in countries and ages. For travellers make no &s;uch remarks of the&s;e countries at pre&s;ent. On the countrary, we are apt to &s;uppo&s;e the northern nations more fertile. As tho&s;e two countries were provinces of the Roman empire, 'tis difficult, tho' not altogether ab&s;urd, to &s;uppo&s;e that &s;uch a man as COLUMELLA might be mi&s;taken with regard to them.</NOTE>. To prove, therefore, or account for the
greater populou&s;ne&s;s of antiquity, by the imaginary
youth or vigour of the world, will &s;carce be admitted
by any ju&s;t rea&s;oner. The&s;e <HI>general phy&s;ical</HI> cau&s;es
ought entirely to be excluded from that que&s;tion.</P>
<P>THERE are indeed &s;ome more <HI>particular phy&s;i$al</HI>
cau&s;es of great importance. Di&s;ea&s;es are mentioned
<PB N="170" REF="170">
in antiquity, which are almo&s;t unknown to modern
medicine; and new di&s;ea&s;es have ari&s;en, and propa|gated
them&s;elves, of which there are no traces in an|tient
hi&s;tory. And in this particular we may ob|&s;erve,
upon compari&s;on, that the di&s;advantage is very
much on the &s;ide of the moderns. Not to mention
&s;ome others of le&s;s importance; the &s;mall pox com|mits
&s;uch ravages, as would almo&s;t alone account for
the great &s;uperiority a&s;cribed to antient times. The
tenth or the twelfth part of mankind, de&s;troyed every
generation, &s;hould make a va&s;t difference, it may be
thought, in the numbers of the people; and when
joined to veneral di&s;tempers, a new plague diffu&s;ed
every where, this di&s;ea&s;e is perhaps equivalent, by its
con&s;tant operation, to the three great &s;courges of man|kind,
war, pe&s;tilence, and famine. Were it certain,
therefore, that antient times were more populous than
the pre&s;ent, and could no moral cau&s;es be a&s;&s;igned
for &s;o great a change; the&s;e phy&s;ical cau&s;es alone, in
the opinion of many, would be &s;ufficient to give us
&s;atisfaction on that head.</P>
<P>BUT is it certain, that antiquity was &s;o much more
populous, as is pretended? The extravagancies of
VOSSIUS, with regard to his &s;ubject, are well known.
But an author of much greater genius and di&s;cern|ment
has ventured to affirm, that, according to the
be&s;t computations which the&s;e &s;ubjects will admit of,
there are not now, on the face of the earth, the fif|tieth
<PB N="171" REF="171">
part of mankind, which exi&s;ted in the time of
JULIUS CAESAR<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Lettres</HI> PERSANES. See al&s;o <HI>L'E&s;prit des Loix,</HI> liv. 23. cap. 17, 18, 19.</NOTE>. It may ea&s;ily be ob&s;erved, that
the compari&s;ons, in this ca&s;e, mu&s;t be very imperfect,
even tho' we confine our&s;elves to the &s;cene of antient
hi&s;tory; EUROPE, and the nations about the MEDI|TERRANEAN.
We know not exactly the numbers of
any EUROPEAN kingdom, or even city, at pre&s;ent:
How can we pretend to calculate tho&s;e of antient
cities and &s;tates, where hi&s;torians have left us &s;uch
imperfect traces? For may pa$t, the matter appears
to me &s;o uncertain, that, as I intend to throw toge|ther
&s;ome reflections on that head, I &s;hall intermingle
the inquiry concerning <HI>cau&s;es</HI> with that concerning
<HI>facts;</HI> which ought never to be admitted, where the
facts can be a&s;certained with any tolerable a&s;&s;urance.
We &s;hall, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> con&s;ider, whether it be probable, from
what we know of the &s;ituation of &s;ociety in both pe|riods,
that antiquity mu&s;t have been more populous;
<HI>&s;econdly,</HI> whether in reality it was &s;o. If I can make it
appear, that the conclu&s;ion is not &s;o certain as is pre|tended,
in favour of antiquity, 'tis all I a&s;pire to.</P>
<P>IN general, we may ob&s;erve, that the que&s;tion with
regard to the comparative populou&s;ne&s;s of ages or
kingdoms implies very important con&s;equences, and
commonly determines concerning the preference of their
<PB N="172" REF="172">
whole police, their manners, and the con&s;titution of their
government. For as there is in all men, both male and
female, a de&s;ire and power of generation, more ac|tive
than is very univer&s;ally exerted, the re&s;traints which
they lie under, mu&s;t proceed from &s;ome difficulties
in their &s;ituation, which it belongs to a wi&s;e legi&s;la|ture
carefully to ob&s;erve and remove. Almo&s;t every
man who thinks he can maintain a family, will have
one; and the human &s;pecies, at this rate of propaga|tion,
would more than double every generation.
How fa&s;t do mankind multiply in every colony or
new &s;ettlement; where it is an ea&s;y matter to provide
for a family; and where men are no way &s;traitened or
confined, as in long e&s;tabli&s;hed governments? Hi&s;tory
tells us frequently of plagues, which have &s;wept away
the third or fourth part of a people: Yet in a ge|neration
or two, the de&s;truction was not perceived;
and the &s;ociety had again acquired their former num|ber.
The lands which were cultivated, the hou&s;es
built, the commodities rai&s;ed, the riches acquired,
enabled the people who e&s;caped, immediately to mar|ry,
and to rear families, which &s;upplied the place of
tho&s;e who had peri&s;hed<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">This too is a good rea&s;on why the &s;mall-pox does not depo|pulate countries &s;o much as may at fir&s;t &s;ight be imagined. Where there is room for more people, they will always ari&s;e, even with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of naturalization bills. 'Tis remarked by Don GERONIMO DE USTARIZ, that the provinces of SPAIN which &s;end mo&s;t people to the INDIES, are mo&s;t populous; which pro|ceeds from their &s;uperior riches.</NOTE>. And for a like rea&s;on,
<PB N="173" REF="173">
every wi&s;e, ju&s;t, and mild government, by rendering
the condition of its &s;ubjects ea&s;y and &s;ecure, will al|ways
abound mo&s;t in people, as well as in commodi|ties
and riches. A count$y, indeed, who&s;e climate
and &s;oil are fitted for vines, will naturally be more
populous than one which produces only corn, and
that more populous than one which is only fitted for
pa&s;turage. But if every thing el&s;e be equal, it &s;eems
natural to expect, that where-ever there are mo&s;t hap|pine&s;s
and virtue, and the wi&s;e&s;t in&s;titutions, there will
al&s;o be mo&s;t people.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tion, therefore, concerning the populou&s;|ne&s;s

thro' out the greate&s;t part of EUROPE. Some
pa&s;&s;ionate admirers of the antients, and zealous par|tizans
of civil liberty, (for the&s;e &s;entiments, as they
are both of them, in the main, extremely ju&s;t, are
&s;ound to be almo&s;t in&s;eparable) cannot forbear re|gretting
the lo&s;s of this in&s;titution; and whil&s;t they
brand all &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the government of a &s;ingle
per&s;on with the har&s;h denomination of &s;lavery, they
would gladly reduce the greate&s;t part of mankind to
real &s;lavery and &s;ubjection. But to one who con&s;iders
coolly on the &s;ubject, it will appear, that human na|ture,
in general, really enjoys more liberty at pre|&s;ent,
in the mo&s;t arbitrary government of EUROPE,
than it ever did during the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing period of
antient times. As much as &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to a petty
prince, who&s;e dominions extend not beyond a &s;ingle
city, is more grievous than obedience to a great mo|narch;
&s;o much is dome&s;tic &s;lavery more cruel and
oppre&s;&s;ive than any civil &s;ubjection what&s;oever. The
more the ma&s;ter is removed from us in place and rank,
the greater liberty we enjoy; the le&s;s are our actions
in&s;pected and controled; and the fainter that cruel
compari&s;on becomes between our own &s;ubjection, and
the freedom, and even dominion of another. The
remains that are found of dome&s;tic &s;lavery, in the
AMERICAN colonies, and among &s;ome EUROPEAN
nations, would never &s;urely create a de&s;ire of render|ing
it more univer&s;al. The little humanity commonly
<PB N="175" REF="175">
ob&s;erved in per&s;ons accu&s;tomed, from their infancy,
to exerci&s;e &s;o great authority over their fellow-crea|tures,
and to trample upon human nature, were &s;uf|ficient
alone to di&s;gu&s;t us with that authority. Nor
can a more probable rea&s;on be given for the &s;evere, I
might &s;ay, barbarous, manners of antient times, than
the practice of dome&s;tic &s;lavery; by which every man
of rank was rendered a petty tyrant, and educated
amid&s;t the flattery, &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and low deba&s;ement
of his &s;laves.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the antient practice, all checks were
on the inferior, to re&s;train him to the duty of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion;
none on the &s;uperior, to engage him to the
reciprocal duties of gentlene&s;s and humanity. In
modern times, a bad &s;ervant finds not ea&s;ily a good
ma&s;ter, nor a bad ma&s;ter a good &s;ervant; and the
checks are mutual, &s;uitable to the inviolable and
eternal laws of rea&s;on and equity.</P>

The inhuman &s;ports exhibited at ROME, may ju&s;tly be con&s;idered too as an effect of the people's contempt for &s;laves, and was al&s;o a great cau&s;e of the general inhumanity of their princes and rulers. Who can read the accounts of the am|phitheatrical entertainments without horror? Or who is &s;ur|prized, that the emperors &s;hould treat that people in the &s;ame way the people treated their inferiors? One's humanity, on that occa&s;ion, is apt to renew the barbarous wi&s;h of CALIGULA, that the people had but one neck.

<P>BUT our pre&s;ent bu&s;ine&s;s is only to con&s;ider the
influence of &s;lavery on the populou&s;ne&s;s of a &s;tate.
'Tis pretended, that, in this particular, the antient
practice had infinitely the advantage, and was the
chief cau&s;e of that extreme populou&s;ne&s;s which is
&s;uppo&s;ed in tho&s;e times. At pre&s;ent, all ma&s;ters di&s;|courage
the marrying of their male &s;ervants, and ad|mit
not by any means the marriage of the female,
who are then &s;uppo&s;ed altogether incapacitated for
<PB N="179" REF="179">
their &s;ervice. But where the property of the &s;ervants
is lodged in the ma&s;ter, their marriage and fertility
form his riches, and bring him a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of &s;laves,
that &s;upply the place of tho&s;e whom age and infirmity
have di&s;abled. He encourages, therefore, their pro|pagation
as much as that of his cattle; rears the
young with the &s;ame care; and educates them to
&s;ome art or calling, which may render them more
u&s;eful or valuable to him. The opulent are, by this
policy, intere&s;ted in the being at lea&s;t, tho' not the
well-being of the poor; and enrich them&s;elves, by
increa&s;ing the number and indu&s;try of tho&s;e who are
&s;ubjected to them. Each man, being a &s;overeign in
his own family, has the &s;ame intere&s;t with regard to
it, as the prince with regard to the &s;tate; and has
not, like the prince, any oppo&s;ite motives of ambi|tion
or vain-glory, which may lead him to depopu|late
his little &s;overeignty. All of it is, at all times,
under his eye; and he has lei&s;ure to in&s;pect the mo&s;t
minute detail of the marriage and education of his
&s;ubjects<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">We may here ob&s;erve, that if dome&s;tic &s;lavery really in|crea&s;ed populou&s;ne&s;s, it would be an exception to the general rule, that the happine&s;s of any &s;ociety and its populou&s;ne&s;s are nece&s;&s;ary attendants. A ma&s;ter, from humour or intere&s;t, may make his &s;laves very unhappy, and yet be careful, from intere&s;t, to increa&s;e their number. Their marriage is not a matter of choice with them, no more than any other action of their life.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="180" REF="180">
SUCH are the con&s;equences of dome&s;tic &s;lavery,
according to the fir&s;t a&s;pect and appearance of things:
But if we enter more deeply into the &s;ubject, we &s;hall
perhaps find rea&s;on to retract our ha&s;ty determinations.
The compari&s;on is &s;hocking between the management
of human creatures and that of cattle; but being ex|tremely
ju&s;t, when applied to the pre&s;ent &s;ubject, it
may be proper trace the con&s;equences of it. At
the capital, near all great cities, in all populous, rich,
indu&s;trious provinces, few cattle are bred. Provi|&s;ions,
lodging, attendance, labour, are there dear;
and men find better their account in buying the cattle,
after they come to a certain age, from the remoter
and cheaper countries. The&s;e are con&s;equently the
only breeding countries for cattle; and by a parity of
rea&s;on, for men too, when the latter are put on the
&s;ame footing with the former. To rear a child in
LONDON till he could be &s;erviceable, would co&s;t
much dearer, than to buy one of the &s;ame age from
SCOTLAND or IRELAND; where he had been rai&s;ed
in a cottage, covered with rags, and fed on oatmeal
or potatoes. Tho&s;e who had &s;laves, therefore, in all
the richer and more populous countries, would di&s;|courage
the pregnancy of the females, and either
prevent or de&s;troy the birth. The human &s;pecies
would peri&s;h in tho&s;e places where it ought to increa&s;e
the fa&s;te&s;t; and a perpetual recruit be needed from all
the poorer and more de&s;art provinces. Such a conti|nued
drain would tend mightily to depopulate the
<PB N="181" REF="181">
&s;tate, and render great cities ten times more de&s;truc|tive
than with us; where every man is ma&s;ter of him|&s;elf,
and provides for his children from the powerful
in&s;tinct of nature, not the calculations of &s;ordid in|tere&s;t.
If LONDON, at pre&s;ent, without much in|crea&s;ing,
needs a yearly recruit from the country of
5000 people, as is commonly computed; what mu&s;t
it require, if the greate&s;t part of the trade&s;men and
common people were &s;laves, and were hindered from
breeding by their avaricious ma&s;ters?</P>

'Tis an uni|ver&s;al ob&s;ervation which we may form upon language, that where two related parts of a whole bear any proportion to each other, in numbers, rank, or con&s;ideration, there are always correlative terms invented, which an&s;wer to both the parts, and expre&s;s their mutual relation.

<P>CONSTANTINOPLE, at pre&s;ent, requires the &s;ame

parts of AFRICA; the other from MINGRELLA, CIR|CASSIA,
and TARTARY.</P>
<P>OUR modern convents are, no doubt, very bad
in&s;titutions: But there is rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect, that anti|ently
every great family in ITALY, and probably in
other parts of the world, was a &s;pecies of convent.
And tho' we have rea&s;on to dete&s;t all tho&s;e popi&s;h in|&s;titutions,
as nur&s;eries of the mo&s;t abject &s;uper&s;tition,
burthen&s;ome to the public, and oppre&s;&s;ive to the poor
pri&s;oners, male as well as female; yet may it be
que&s;tioned whether they be &s;o de&s;tructive to the po|pulou&s;ne&s;s
of a &s;tate as is commonly imagined. Were
the land which belongs to a convent, be&s;towed on a
nobleman, he would &s;pend its revenue on dogs, hor&s;es,
grooms, footmen, cooks, and hou&s;e-maids; and his
<PB N="195" REF="195">
family would not furni&s;h many more citizens than the
convent.</P>
<P>THE common rea&s;on why parents thru&s;t their daugh|ters
into nunneries, is, that they may not be over|burthened
with too numerous a family; but the an|tients
had a method almo&s;t as innocent, and more ef|fectual
to that purpo&s;e, <HI>viz.</HI> the expo&s;ing their chil|dren
in the earlie&s;t infancy. This practice was very
common; and is not mentioned by any author of
tho&s;e times with the horror it de&s;erves, or &s;carce<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">TACITUS blames it. De morib. Germ.</NOTE> even
with di&s;approbation. PLUTARCH, the humane,
good natured PLUTARCH,<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">De fraterno amore. SENECA al&s;o approves of the expo&s;ing of &s;ickly, infirm children. De ira, lib. 1. cap. 15.</NOTE> recommends it as a vir|tue
in ATTALUS, king of PERGAMUS, that he mur|dered,
or, if you will, expo&s;ed all his own children,
in order to leave his crown to the &s;on of his brother,
EUMENES; &s;ignalizing in this manner his gratitude
and affection to EUMENES, who had left him his heir
preferable to that &s;on. It was SOLON, the mo&s;t cele|brated
of the &s;ages of GREECE, who gave parents
permi&s;&s;ion by law to kill their children<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">SEXT. EMP. lib. 3. cap. 24.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>SHALL we then allow the&s;e two circum&s;tances to
compen&s;ate each other, <HI>viz.</HI> mona&s;tic vows and the
expo&s;ing of children, and to be unfavourable, in
<PB N="196" REF="196">
equal degrees, to the propagation of mankind? I
doubt the advantage is here on the &s;ide of antiquity.
Perhaps, by an odd connection of cau&s;es, the barba|rous
practice of the antients might rather render tho&s;e
times more populous. By removing the terrors of
too numerous a family, it would engage many people
in marriage; and &s;uch is the force of natural affec|tion,
that very few, in compari&s;on, would have re&s;o|lution
enough, when it came to the pu&s;h, to carry in|to
execution their former intentions.</P>
<P>CHINA, the only country where this cruel prac|tice
of expo&s;ing children prevails at pre&s;ent, is the
mo&s;t populous country we know; and every man is
married before he is twenty. Such early marriages
could &s;carce be general, had not men the pro&s;pect of
&s;o ea&s;y a method of getting rid of their children.
I own, that PLUTARCH<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De amore prolis.</NOTE> &s;peaks of it as a very uni|ver&s;al
maxim of the poor to expo&s;e their children;
and as the rich were then aver&s;e to marriage, on ac|count
of the court&s;hip they met with from tho&s;e who
expected legacies from them, the public mu&s;t have
been in a bad &s;ituation betwixt them<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P>The practice of leaving great &s;ums of money to friends, tho' one had near relations, was common in GREECE as well as ROME; as we may gather from LUCIAN.

See farther on this head, E&s;&s;ays moral, politi|cal, and literary, Part I. e&s;&s;ay XXI.

their people by a ridiculous mimickry of the greater

<P>ANTIENT battles were much more bloody by the
very nature of the weapons employed in them. The
antients drew up their men 16 or 20, &s;ometimes 50

not difficult to find a field, in which both armies
might be mar&s;halled, and might engage with each
other. Even where any body of the troops was kept
off by hedges, hillocks, woods, or hollow ways, the
battle was not &s;o &s;oon decided betwixt the contending
parties, but that the others had time to overcome the
<PB N="205" REF="205">
difficulties which oppo&s;ed them, and take part in the
engagement. And as the whole armies were thus en|gaged,

the battles were commonly very bloody, and great
&s;laughter was made on both &s;ides, but e&s;pecially on

But unluckily the hi&s;tory of the ROMAN common|wealth,
in its earlier times, if we give credit to the re|ceived
accounts, &s;tands again&s;t us. No blood was
ever &s;hed in any &s;edition at ROME, till the murder of
the GRACCHI. DIONYSIUS HA$ICARNASSAEUS<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">Lib. I.</NOTE>,
Ob&s;erving the &s;ingular humanity of the ROMAN peo|ple
in this particular, makes u&s;e of it as an argument
that they were originally of GRECIAN extraction:
Whence we may conclude, that the factions and re|volutions
in the barbarous republics were more violent
than even tho&s;e of GREECE above-mentioned.</P>
<P>IF the ROMANS were &s;o late in coming to blows,
they made ample compen&s;ation after they had once

of ma&s;&s;acres, pro&s;criptions, and forfeitures, that ever

that hi&s;torian, is, that he &s;eems to feel a proper re|&s;entment
of the&s;e barbarous proceedings; and talks
not with that provoking coolne&s;s and indifference,
which cu&s;tom had produced in many of the GREEK

The Bi&s;hop of ROCHESTER, who was his friend, and of the &s;ame party, had been bani&s;hed a little before by a bill of attainder, with great ju&s;tice, but without &s;uch a proof as was legal, or ac|cording to the &s;trict forms of common law.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE maxims of antient politics contain, in general,
&s;o little humanity and moderation, that it &s;eems &s;u|perfluous
<PB N="219" REF="219">
to give any particular rea&s;on for the violen|ces
committed at any particular period. Yet I can|not
forbear ob&s;erving, that the laws, in the latter ages
of the ROMAN commonwealth, were &s;o ab&s;urdly con|trived,
that they obliged the heads of parties to have
recour&s;e to the&s;e extremities. All capital puni&s;hments
were aboli&s;hed: However criminal, or, what is more,
however dangerous any citizen might be, he could not
regularly be puni&s;hed otherwi&s;e than by bani&s;hment:
And it became nece&s;&s;ary, in the revolutions of party,
to draw the &s;word of private vengeance; nor was it
ea&s;y, when laws were once violated, to &s;et bounds to
the&s;e &s;anguinary proceedings. Had BRUTUS him&s;elf
prevailed over the <HI>triumvirate,</HI> could $e, in common
prudence, have allowed OCTAVIUS and ANTHONY
to live, and have contented him&s;elf with bani&s;hing
them to RHODES or MARSEILLES, where they might
&s;till have plotted new commotions and rebellions.
His executing C. ANTONIUS, brother to the <HI>triumvir,</HI>
&s;hows evidently his &s;en&s;e of the matter. Did not
CICERO, with the approbation of all the wi&s;e and
virtuous of ROME, arbitrarily put to death CATI|LINE's
a&s;&s;ociates, contrary to law, and without any
trial or form of proce&s;s? And if he moderated his ex|$cutions,
did it not proceed, either from the clemency
of his temper, or the conjunctures of the times? A
wre$ched &s;ecurity in a government which pretends to
laws and liberty!</P>

THUS, one extreme produces another. In the
&s;ame manner as exce&s;&s;ive &s;everity in the laws is apt to
beget great relaxation in their execution; &s;o their ex|ce&s;&s;ive

<P>ONE general cau&s;e of the di&s;orders &s;o frequent in all
antient governments, &s;eems to have con&s;i&s;ted in the

TYRE, which carried on, after CARTHAGE, the

AMONG the other inconveniencies which the ATHE|NIANS
felt from the fortifying DECELIA by the LA|CEDEMONIANS,
it is repre&s;ented by THUCYDIDES<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 7.</NOTE>,
as one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable, that they could not
bring over their corn from EUBEA by land, pa&s;&s;ing
by OROPUS; but were obliged to imbark it, and to
&s;ail about the promontory of SUNIUM. A &s;urpri&s;ing
in&s;tance of the imperfection of antient navigation:
For the water-carriage is not here above double the
land.</P>
<P>I Do not remember any pa&s;&s;age in any antient au|thor,
where the growth of any city is a&s;cribed to the
e&s;tabli&s;hment of a manufacture. The commerce which
is &s;aid to flouri&s;h, is chiefly the exchange of tho&s;e
commodities for which different &s;oils and climates
were &s;uited. The &s;ale of wine and oil into AFRICA,
according to DIODORUS SICULUS<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 13.</NOTE>, was the foun|dation
of the riches of AGRIGENTUM. The &s;itu|ation
of the city of SYBARIS, according to the &s;ame
author<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 12.</NOTE>, was the cau&s;e of its immen&s;e populou&s;ne&s;s;
being built near the two rivers CRATHYS and SYBA|RIS.
But the&s;e two rivers, we may ob&s;erve, are not
navigable; and could only produce &s;ome fertile val|leys,
for agriculature and hu&s;bandry; an advantage &s;o
incon&s;iderable, that a modern writer would &s;carcely
have taken notice of it.</P>
<P><PB N="225" REF="225">
THE barbarity of the antient tyrants, together with
the extreme love of liberty, which animated tho&s;e
ages, mu&s;t have bani&s;hed every merchant and manu|facturer;
and have quite depopulated the &s;tate, had it
&s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon indu&s;try and commerce. While the
cruel and &s;u&s;picious DIONYSIUS was carrying on his
butcheries, who, that was not detained by his landed
property, and could have carried with him any art
or &s;kill to procure a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence in other countries,
would have remained expo&s;ed to &s;uch implacable
barbarity? The per&s;ecutions of PHILIP II. and LEWIS
XIV. filled all EUROPE with the manufacturers of
FLANDERS and of FRANCE.</P>
<P>I GRANT, that agriculture is the &s;pecies of indu&s;try
which is chiefly requi&s;ite to the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of mul|titudes;
and it is po&s;&s;ible, that this indu&s;try may
flouri&s;h, even where manufactures and other arts are
unknown or neglected. SWISSERLAND is at pre&s;ent a
very remarkable in&s;tance; where we find, at once, the
mo&s;t &s;kilful hu&s;bandmen and the mo&s;t bungling trade&s;|men,
that are to be met with in all EUROPE. That
agriculture flouri&s;hed mightily in GREECE and ITA|LY,
at lea&s;t in &s;ome parts of them, and at &s;ome pe|riods,
we have rea&s;on to pre&s;ume: And whether the
mechanical arts had reached the &s;ame degree of per|fection,
may not be e&s;teemed &s;o material; e&s;pecially,
if we con&s;ider the great equality in the antient re|publics,
where each family was obliged to cultivate,
<PB N="226" REF="226">
with the greate&s;t care and indu&s;try, its own little field,
in order to its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>BUT is it ju&s;t rea&s;oning, becau&s;e agriculture may, in
&s;ome in&s;tances, flouri&s;h without trade or manufactures,
to conclude, that, in any great extent of country,
and for any great tract of time, it would &s;ub&s;i&s;t alone?
The mo&s;t natural way, &s;urely, of encouraging hu&s;|bandry,
is, fir&s;t, to excite other kinds of indu&s;try,
and thereby afford the labourer a ready market for his
commodities, and a return of &s;uch goods as may con|tribute
to his plea&s;ure and enjoyment. This method
is infallible and univer&s;al; and as it prevails more in
modern government than in the antient, it affords a
pre&s;umption of the &s;uperior populou&s;ne&s;s of the former.</P>
<P>EVERY man, &s;ays XENOPHON<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Oecon.</NOTE>, may be a farmer:
No art or &s;kill is requi&s;ite: All con&s;i&s;ts in the indu&s;try,

COLUMELLA hints, that agriculture was but little
known in the age of XENOPHON.</P>
<P>ALL our latter improvements and refinements, have
they operated nothing towards the ea&s;y &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of
men, and con&s;equently towards their propagation and
increa&s;e? Our &s;uperior &s;kill in mechanics, the di&s;|covery
of new worlds, by which commerce has been
&s;o much enlarged, the e&s;tabli&s;hment of po&s;ts, and
<PB N="227" REF="227">
the u&s;e of bills of exchange. The&s;e &s;eem all extremely

Were we to &s;trike off the&s;e, what a
check &s;hould we give to every kind of bu&s;ine&s;s and
labour, and what multitudes of families would imme|diately
peri&s;h from want and hunger? And it &s;eems
not probable, that we could &s;upply the place of the&s;e
new inventions by any other regulation or in&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>HAVE
we rea&s;on to think, that the police of an|tient
&s;tates was any way comparable to that of mo|dern,
or that men had then equal &s;ecurity, either at
home, or in their journies by land or water? I
que&s;tion not, but every impartial examiner would give
us the preference in this particular<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">See Part I. E&s;&s;ay XV.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THUS, upon comparing the whole, it &s;eems im|po&s;&s;ible
to a&s;&s;ign any ju&s;t rea&s;on, why the world &s;hould
have been more populous in antient than in modern
times. The equality of property, among the anti|ents,
liberty, and the &s;mall divi&s;ions of their &s;tates,
were indeed favourable to the propagation of man|kind:
But their wars were more bloody and de&s;truc|tive,
their governments more factious and un&s;ettled,
commerce and manufactures more feeble and langui&s;h|ing,
and the general police more loo&s;e and irregular.
The&s;e latter di&s;advantages &s;eem to form a &s;ufficient
<PB N="228" REF="228">
counterbalance to the former advantage; and rather
favour the oppo&s;ite opinion to that which commonly
prevails with regard to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>BUT there is no rea&s;oning, it may be &s;aid, again&s;t
matter of fact. If it appear, that the world was then
more populous than at pre&s;ent, we may be a&s;&s;ured,
that our conjectures are fal&s;e, and that we have over-looked
&s;ome material circum&s;tance in the compari&s;on.
This I readily own: All our preceding rea&s;onings, I
acknowledge to be mere tri$$ing, or, at lea&s;t, &s;mall
&s;kirmi&s;hes and $rivolous rencounters, which decide no|thing.
But unluckily the main combat, where we
compare facts, cannot be rendered much more deci|&s;ive.
The facts delivered by antient authors, are
either &s;o uncertain or &s;o imperfect as to afford us no|thing
po&s;itive in this matter. How indeed could it
be otherwi&s;e? The very facts which we mu&s;t oppo&s;e
to them, in computing the greatne&s;s of modern &s;tates,
are far from being either certain or compleat. Many
grounds of calculation, proceeded on by celebrated
writers, are little better than tho&s;e of the Emperor
HELIOGABALUS, who formed an e&s;timate of the im|men&s;e
greatne&s;s of ROME, from ten thou&s;and pound
weight of cobwebs which had been found in that
city<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">AELII LA$$RID. <HI>in vita</HI> HELIOGA$. cap. 26.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="229" REF="229">
'TIS to be remarked, that all kinds of numbers are
uncertain in antient manu&s;cripts, and have been &s;ub|ject
to much greater corruptions than any other part
of the text; and that for a very obvious rea&s;on. Any
alteration, in other places, commonly affects the &s;en&s;e
or grammar, and is more readily perceived by the
reader and tran&s;criber.</P>
<P>FEW enumerations of inhabitants have been made
of any tract of country by any antient author of good
authority, &s;o as to afford us a large enough view for
compari&s;on.</P>
<P>'TIS probables, that there was formerly a good foun|dation
for the number of citizens a&s;&s;igned to any free
city; becau&s;e they entered for a &s;hare of the govern|ment,

But as the number of &s;laves is &s;eldom mentioned,
this leaves us in as great uncertainty as ever, with re|gard

<P>THE fir&s;t page of THUCYDIDES is, in my opinion,
the commencement of real hi&s;tory. All preceding

<P>ONE would imagine, that every circum&s;tance of
the life and actions of DIONYSIUS the elder might
be regarded as authentic, and free from all fabulous
exaggeration; both becau&s;e he lived at a time when
letters flouri&s;hed mo&s;t in GREECE, and becau&s;e his
chief hi&s;torian was PHILISTUS, a man allowed to be
of great genius, and who was a courtier and mini&s;ter
of that prince. But can we admit, that he had a
&s;tanding army of 100,000 $oot, 10,000 hor&s;e, and a
fleet of 400 gallies<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">DIOD. SIC. lib. 2.</NOTE>? The&s;e, we may ob&s;erve, were
mercenary forces, and &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon their pay, like
our armies in EUROPE. For the citizens were all di&s;|armed;
and when DION afterwards invaded SICILY,
and called on his countrymen to vindicate their liber|ty,
he was obliged to bring arms along with him,
which he di&s;tributed among tho&s;e who joined him<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCH, <HI>in vita</HI> DIONIS.</NOTE>.
In a &s;tate where agriculture alone flouri&s;hes, there
may be many inhabitants; and if the&s;e be all armed

from their commerce and indu&s;try. DIODORUS

of DIONYSIUS appeared incredible; that is, as I in|terpret
it, it was entirely a fiction, and the opinion
aro&s;e from the exaggerated flattery of the courtiers,

we po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed before the DECELIAN war. A way

number of ATHENAEUS.</P>
<P><HI>Ninthly,</HI> THE whole <HI>cen&s;us</HI> of the &s;tate of ATHENS
was le&s;s than 6000 talents. And tho' numbers in an|tient
manu&s;cripts be often &s;u&s;pected by critics, yet
this is unexceptionable; both becau&s;e DEMOSTHENES<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">De cla&s;&s;ibus.</NOTE>,
who gives it, gives al&s;o the detail, which checks him;
and becau&s;e POLYBIUS<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 62.</NOTE> a&s;&s;igns the &s;ame number,
and rea&s;ons upon it. Now, the mo&s;t vulgar &s;lave
could yield by his labour an <HI>obolus</HI> a-day, over and
above his maintenance, as we learn from XENOPHON<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">De rat. red.</NOTE>,
who &s;ays, that NICIAS's over&s;eer paid his ma&s;ter &s;o
much for &s;laves, whom he employed in digging of
mines. If you will take the pains to e&s;timate an
<HI>obolus</HI> a-day, and the &s;laves at 400,000, computing
only at four years purcha&s;e, you will find the &s;um
above 12,000 talents; even tho' allowance be made
for the great number of holidays in ATHENS. Be|&s;ides,
many of the &s;laves would have a much greater
value from their art. The lowe&s;t that DEMOSTHE|NES
<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Contra</HI> APHOBUM:</NOTE> e&s;timates any of his father's &s;laves, is two minas
a-head. And upon this &s;uppo&s;ition, it is a little dif|ficult,
<PB N="242" REF="242">
I confe&s;s, to reconcile even the number of
40,000 &s;laves with the <HI>cen&s;us</HI> of 6000 talents.</P>
<P><HI>Tenthly,</HI> CHIOS is &s;aid by THUCYDIDES<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 8.</NOTE>, to con|tain
more &s;laves than any GREEK city, except SPAR|TA.
SPARTA then had more than ATHENS, in pro|portion
to the number of citizens. The SPARTANS
were 9000 in the town, 30,000 in the country<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCH, <HI>in vita</HI> LICURG.</NOTE>.
The male &s;laves, therefore, of full age, mu&s;t have
been more than 780,000; the whole more than
3,120,000. A number impo&s;&s;ible to be maintained
in a narrow barren country, &s;uch as LACONIA, which
had no trade. Had the HELOTES been &s;o very nu|merous,
the murder of 2000 mentioned by THUCY|DIDES<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 4.</NOTE>, would have irritated them, without weak|ening
them.</P>
<P>BESIDES, we are to con&s;ider, that the number a&s;|&s;igned
by ATHENAEUS<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">The &s;ame author affirms, that CORINTH had once 460,000 &s;laves, AEGINA 470,000. But the foregoing arguments hold &s;tronger again&s;t the&s;e facts: 'Tis however remarkable, that ATHENAEUS cites &s;o great an authority as ARISTOTLE for this la&s;t fact: And the &s;cholia&s;t on PINDAR mentions the &s;ame num|ber of &s;laves in AEGINA.</NOTE>, whatever it is, comprehends
all the inhabitants of ATTICA, as well as tho&s;e of
<PB N="243" REF="243">
ATHENS. The ATHENIANS affected much a coun|try
life, as we learn from THUCYDIDES<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2.</NOTE>; and when
they were all cha&s;ed into town, by the inva&s;ion of
their territory during the PELOPONNESIAN war, the
city was not able to contain them; and they were
obliged to lie in the porticoes, temples, and even
&s;treets, for want of lodging<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">THUCYD. lib. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame remark is to be extended to all the
other GREEK cities; and when the number of the
citizens is a&s;&s;igned, we mu&s;t always under&s;tand it of
the inhabitants of the neighbouring country, as well as
of the city. Yet, even with this allowance, it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, that GREECE was a populous country, and
exceeded what we could imagine of &s;o narrow a ter|ritory,
naturally not very fertile, and which drew no
&s;upplies of corn from other places. For excepting
ATHENS, which traded to PONTUS for that commo|dity,
the other cities &s;eem to have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted chiefly
from their neighbouring territory<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">DEMOST. <HI>contra</HI> LEPT. The ATHENIANS brought yearly from PONTUS 400,000 medimni or bu&s;hels of corn, as appeared from the cu&s;tom-hou&s;e books. And this was the greate&s;t part of their importation. This by the by is a &s;trong proof that there is &s;ome great mi&s;take in the foregoing pa&s;&s;age of ATHE|NAEUS.

<P>All the be&s;t manu&s;cripts of PLINY read the pa&s;&s;age as here cited, and fix the compa&s;s of the walls of Rome to be thirteen miles. The que&s;tion is, What PLINY means by 30,775 paces, and how that number was formed? The manner in which I con|ceive it, is this. ROME was a &s;emicircular area of thirteen miles circumference. The Forum, and con&s;equently the Milli|arium, we know, was &s;ituated on the banks of the TYBER, and near the center of the circle, or upon the diameter of the &s;emi|circular area. Tho' there were thirty-&s;even gates to ROME, yet only twelve of them had &s;traight &s;treets, leading from them to the Milliarium. PLINY, therefore, having a&s;&s;igned the circum|ference of ROME, and knowing that that alone was not &s;uffi|cient to give us a ju&s;t notion of its &s;urface, u&s;es this farther me|thod. He &s;uppo&s;es all the &s;treets, leading from the Milliarium to the twelve gates, to be laid together into one &s;traight line, and &s;uppo&s;es we run along that line, &s;o as to count each gate once: In which ca&s;e, he &s;ays, that the whole line is 30,775 paces: Or, in other words, that each &s;treet or radius of the &s;emicircular area is upon an average two miles and a half; and the whole length of ROME is five miles, and its breadth about half as much; be&s;ides the &s;cattered &s;uburbs.</P>
<P>PERE HARDOUIN under&s;tands this pa&s;&s;age in the &s;ame man|ner; with regard to the laying together the &s;everal &s;treets of ROME into one line, in order to compo&s;e 30,775 paces: But then he &s;uppo&s;es, that &s;treets led from the Milliarium to every gate$ and that no &s;treet exceeded 800 paces in length. But (1.) a &s;e|micircular area, who&s;e radius was only 800 paces, could never have a circumference near thirteen miles, the compa&s;s of ROME as a&s;&s;igned by PLINY. A radius of two miles and a half forms very nearly that circumference. (2.) There is an ab&s;urdity in &s;up|po&s;ing a city &s;o built as to have &s;treets running to its center from every gate in its circumference. The&s;e &s;treets mu&s;t interfere as they approach. (3.) This dimini&s;hes too much from the great|ne&s;s of antient ROME, and reduces that city below even BRIS|TOL or ROTTERDAM.</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;e which VOSSIUS in his <HI>Ob&s;ervationes variae</HI> puts on this pa&s;&s;age of PLINY, errs widely in the other extreme. One manu&s;cript, of no authority, in&s;tead of thirteen miles, has a&s;|&s;igned thirty miles for the compa&s;s of the walls of ROME. And VOSSIUS under&s;tands this only of the curvilinear part of the circumference; &s;uppo&s;ing, that as the TYBER formed the dia|meter, there were no walls built on that &s;ide. But (1.) this reading is allowed contrary to almo&s;t all the manu&s;cripts. (2.) Why &s;hould PLINY, a conci&s;e writer, repeat the compa&s;s of the walls of ROME in two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive &s;entences? (3.) Why repeat it with &s;o &s;en&s;ible a variation? (4.) What is the meaning of PLINY'S mentioning twice the MILLIARIUM, if a line was mea&s;ured that had no dependence on the MILLIARIUM? (5.) AURELIAN's wall is &s;aid by VOPISCUS to have been drawn <HI>laxi|or $$$bitu,</HI> and to have comprehended all the buildings and &s;ub|urbs on the north &s;ide of the TYBER; yet its compa&s;s was only fifty miles; and even here critics &s;u&s;pect &s;ome mi&s;take or cor|ruption in the text. It is not probable, that ROME would di|mini&s;h from AUGUSTUS to AURELIAN. It remained &s;till the capital of the &s;ame empire; and none of the civil wars in that long period, except the tumults on the death of MAXIMUS and BALBINUS ever affected the city. CARACALLA is &s;aid by AURELIUS VICTOR to have increa&s;ed ROME. (6.) There are no remains of antient buildings, which mark any &s;uch greatne&s;s of ROME. VOSSIUS's reply to this objection &s;eems ab&s;urd, That the rubbi&s;h would &s;ink &s;ixty or &s;eventy feet below ground. It appears from SPARTIAN <HI>(in vita Severi)</HI> that the five-mile &s;tone <HI>in via Lavicana</HI> was out of the city. (7.) OLYMPIODORUS and PUBLIUS VICTOR fix the number of hou&s;es in ROME to be betwixt forty and fifty thou|&s;and. (8.) The very extravagance of the con&s;equences drawn by this critic, as well as LIPSIUS, if they be nece&s;&s;ary, de&s;troys the foundation on which they are grounded: That ROME con|tained fourteen milliens of inhabitants; while the whole king|dom of FRANCE contains only five, according to his computa|tion, &amp;c.</P>
<P>The only objection to the &s;en&s;e which we have affixed above to the pa&s;&s;age of PLINY, &s;eems to lie in this, That PLINY, after mentioning the thirty-&s;even gates of ROME, a&s;&s;igns only a rea&s;on for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the &s;even old ones, and &s;ays nothing of the eighteen gates, the &s;treets leading from which terminated, ac|cording to my opinion, before they reached the Forum. But as PLINY was writing to the ROMANS, who perfectly knew the di&s;|po&s;ition of the &s;treets, it is not &s;trange he &s;hould take a circum|&s;tance for granted, which was &s;o familiar to every body.

<P>WE learn from VOPISCUS<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In AURELIAN. cap. 48.</NOTE>, that there was in

<P>IT may not be ami&s;s to take notice of the ac|count
which POLYBIUS<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 12. cap. 2.</NOTE> gives of the great herds of
&s;wine to be met with in TUSCANY and LOMBARDY,
as well as in GREECE, and of the method of feeding
them which was then practi&s;ed. &startq;There are great
herds of &s;wine,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;thro'out all ITALY,
particularly, in former times, thro' ETRURIA and
CISALPINE GAUL. And a herd frequently con|tains
a thou&s;and or more &s;wine. When one of
the&s;e herds in feeding meets with another, they
mix together; and the &s;wine-herds have no other
expedient to &s;eparate them than to go to different
quarters, where they &s;ound their horn; and the&s;e
animals, being accu&s;tomed to that &s;ignal, run im|mediately
each to the horn of his own keeper.
Whereas in GREECE, if the herds of &s;wine hap|pen
to mix in the fore&s;ts, he who has the greate&s;t
flock, takes cunningly the opportunity of driving
all away. And thieves are very apt to purloin the
&s;traggling hogs, which have wandered to a great
di&s;tance from their keeper in &s;earch of food.&endq;</P>

MAY we not infer from this account, that the

ethics, which &s;eems to me unaccountable on any &s;up|po&s;ition,
and by proving too much in favour of our
pre&s;ent rea&s;oning, may be thought really to prove
nothing. That philo&s;opher, treating of friend&s;hip,
and ob&s;erving, that that relation ought neither to be
contracted to a very few, nor extended over a great
multitude, illu&s;trates his opinion by the following
argument. &startq;In like manner,&endq; &s;ays he, &startq;as a city

by running into either extreme.&endq; What! impo&s;|&s;ible
that a city can contain a hundred thou&s;and in|habitants!
Had ARISTOTLE never &s;een nor heard

own, pa&s;&s;es my comprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>PLINY<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 6. cap. 28.</NOTE> tells us that SELEUCIA, the &s;eat of the

600,000 people. CARTHAGE is &s;aid by STRABO<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 17.</NOTE> to
have contained 700,000. The inhabitants of PEKIN
are not much more numerous. LONDON, PARIS,
and CONSTANTINOPLE, may admit of nearly the
&s;ame computation; at lea&s;t, the two latter cities do
not exceed it. ROME, ALEXANDRIA, ANTIOCH,
we have already &s;poke of. From the experience of
pa&s;t and pre&s;ent ages, one might conjecture, that
there is a kind of impo&s;&s;ibility, that any city could
ever ri&s;e much beyond this proportion. Whether the
grandeur of a city be founded on commerce or on
empire, there &s;eem to be invincible ob&s;tacles, which
prevent its farther progre&s;s. The &s;eats of va&s;t mo|narchies,
by introducing extravagant luxury, irre|gular
expence, idlene&s;s, dependence, and fal&s;e ideas
of rank and &s;uperiority, are improper for commerce.
Exten&s;ive commerce checks it&s;elf, by rai&s;ing the price
of all labour and commodities. When a great court
engages the attendance of a numerous nobility, po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of overgrown fortunes, the middling gentry re|main
in their provincial towns, where they can make a
figure on a moderate income. And if the dominions

He &s;peaks of that river's freezing as a common

their writers, without intending it, give us inform|ation,
&s;ufficient to convince us, that the winters are
now much more temperate at ROME than formerly.
At pre&s;ent, the TYBER no more freezes at ROME

<P>LET us now ca&s;t our eye over all the countries
which were the &s;cene of antient and modern hi&s;tory,
and compare their pa&s;t and pre&s;ent &s;ituation. We
&s;hall not, perhaps, find &s;uch foundation for the com|plaint
of the pre&s;ent emptine&s;s and de&s;olation of the
world. AEGYPT is repre&s;ented by MAILLET, to
whom we owe the be&s;t account of it, as extremely
populous; tho' he e&s;teems the number of its inhabit|ants
to be dimini&s;hed. SYRIA, and the Le&s;&s;er ASIA,
as well as the coa&s;t of BARBARY, I can readily own,
to be very de&s;art in compari&s;on of their antient con|dition.
The depopulation of GREECE is al&s;o very
obvious. But whether the country now called TUR|KY
in EUROPE may not, in general, contain as many
inhabitants as during the flouri&s;hing period of GREECE,
may be a little doubtful. The THRACIANS &s;eem
then to have lived like the TARTARS at pre&s;ent, by
pa&s;turage and plunder<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Xenopb. exp.</HI> lib. 7. <HI>Polyb.</HI> lib. 4. cap. 45.</NOTE>: The GETES were &s;till more

And tho' the government of the TURKS be not very
favourable to indu&s;try and propagation; yet it pre|&s;erves

<P>POLAND and MUSCOVY in EUROPE are not po|pulous;
but are certainly much more &s;o than the an|tient
SARMATIA and SCYTHIA; where no hu&s;bandry
or agriculture was ever heard of, and pa&s;turage was
the &s;ole art by which the people were maintained.
The like ob&s;ervation may be extended to DENMARK
and SWEDEN. No one ought to e&s;teem the immen&s;e
&s;warms of people, which formerly came from the
North, and over ran all EUROPE, to be any objection
to this opinion. Where a whole nation, or even half
of it remove their &s;eat; 'tis ea&s;y to imagine, what a
prodigious multitude they mu&s;t form; with what de&s;|perate
valour they mu&s;t make their attacks; and how
the terror they &s;trike into the invaded nations will
make the&s;e magnify, in their imagination, both the
courage and multitude of the invaders. SCOTLAND
is neither exten&s;ive nor populous; but were the half
of its inhabitants to &s;eek new &s;eats, they would form
a colony as large as the TEUTONS and CIMBRI;
and would &s;hake all EUROPE, &s;uppo&s;ing it in no better
condition for defence than formerly.</P>
<P><PB N="271" REF="271">
GERMANY has &s;urely at pre&s;ent twenty times more

&s;tates of BELGIUM was about 350,000; the whole
inhabitants a million and a half. And BELGIUM
being about the fourt of GAUL, that country might
contain &s;ix millions, which is not the third of its pre|&s;ent

<P>'Tis remarkable, that tho' DIODORUS SICULUS makes the whole inhabitants of AEGYPT, when conquered by the ROMANS, amount only to three millions; yet JOSEPH. <HI>de belle Jud.</HI> lib. 2. cap. 16. &s;ays, that its inhabitants, excluding tho&s;e of ALEXAN|DRIA, were &s;even millions and a half, in the reign of NERO: And he expre&s;sly &s;ays, that he drew this account from the books of the ROMAN publicans, who levied the poll-tax.

<P>THAT author, endeavouring to account for the

a&s;cribed to the pre&s;ent de&s;olation of the world, pro|ceeding
from former wars and factions; which com|mon
calamity, he adds, has fallen heavier upon
GREECE than on any other country; in&s;omuch, that
the whole could &s;carce at pre&s;ent furni&s;h three thou|&s;and
warriors; a number which, in the time of the
MEDIAN war, were &s;upplied by the &s;ingle city of

of dignity and importance, have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed many of
their oracles, and deign not to u&s;e &s;o many interpreters
of their will to &s;o diminutive a people.</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s, that this pa&s;&s;age contains &s;o many
difficulties, that I know not what to make of it. You
may ob&s;erve, that PLUTARCH a&s;&s;igns, for a cau&s;e of
the decay of mankind, not the exten&s;ive dominion of
the ROMANS, but the former wars and factions of
the &s;everal nations; all which were quieted by the
ROMAN arms. PLUTARCH's rea&s;oning, therefore, is
directly contrary to the inference which is drawn
from the fact he advances.</P>
<P>POLYBIUS &s;uppo&s;es, that GREECE had become
more pro&s;perous and flouri&s;hing after the e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of the ROMAN yoke<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 62. It may perhaps be imagined, that POLY|BIUS, being dependent on ROME, would naturally extol the ROMAN dominion. But, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, POLYBIUS, tho' one &s;ees &s;ometimes in&s;tances of his caution, di&s;covers no &s;ymptoms of flattery. <HI>Secondly,</HI> This opinion is only delivered in a &s;ingle &s;troke, by the by, while he is intent upon another &s;ubject; and 'tis allowed, if there be any &s;u&s;picion of an author's in&s;incerity, that the&s;e oblique propo&s;itions di&s;cover his real opinion better than his more formal and direct a&s;&s;ertions.</NOTE>; and tho' that hi&s;torian

being the patrons, to be the plunderers of mankind;
yet as we find from TACITUS<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Annal.</HI> lib. 1. cap. 2.</NOTE>, that the &s;everity of
the emperors afterwards corrected the licence of the
governors, we have no rea&s;on to think that exten&s;ive

<P>WE learn from STRABO<NOTE N="&Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 8. &amp; 9.</NOTE>, that the ROMANS, from
their regard to the GREEKS, maintained, to his time,
mo&s;t of the privileges and liberties of that celebrated
nation; and NERO afterwards rather increa&s;ed
them<NOTE N="&Verbar;" PLACE="foot">PLUTARCH. <HI>De his qui &s;ero a numine puniuntur.</HI></NOTE>. How therefore can we imagine, that the
ROMAN yoke was &s;o burden&s;ome over that part of the
world? The oppre&s;&s;ion of the procon&s;uls was check|ed;
and the magi&s;tracies in GREECE being all be|&s;towed,
in the &s;everal cities, by the free votes of the
people, there was no great nece&s;&s;ity for the compe|titors

went to &s;eek their fortunes in ROME, and ad|vance

them&s;elves by learning or eloquence, the com|modities
of their native country, many of them would
return with the fortunes which they had acquired,
and thereby inrich the GRECIAN commonwealths.</P>
<P>BUT PLUTARCH &s;ays, that the general depopula|tion
had been more &s;en&s;ibly felt in GREECE than in
any other country. How is this reconcileable to its
&s;uperior privileges and advantages?</P>
<P>BESIDES, this pa&s;&s;age, by proving too much, really
proves nothing. <HI>Only three thou&s;and men able to bear
arms in all</HI> GREECE! Who can admit &s;o &s;trange a
propo&s;ition, e&s;pecially if we con&s;ider the great number
of GREEK cities, who&s;e names &s;till remain in hi&s;tory,
and which are mentioned by writers long after the
age of PLUTARCH? There are there &s;urely ten times
more people at pre&s;ent, when there &s;carce remains a
city in all the bounds of ancient GREECE. That
country is &s;till tolerably cultivated, and furni&s;hes a
&s;ure &s;upply of corn, in ca&s;e of any &s;carcity in SPAIN,
ITALY, or the &s;outh of FRANCE.</P>
<P>WE may ob&s;erve, that the antient frugality of the
GREEKS, and their equality of property, &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted
during the age of PLUTARCH; as appears from LU|CIAN
<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><HI>De mercede condu$tis.</HI></NOTE>. Nor is there any ground to imagine, that
<PB N="283" REF="283">
that country was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by a few ma&s;ters, and a
great number of &s;laves.</P>
<P>'TIS probable, indeed, that military di&s;cipline, be|ing
intirely u&s;ele&s;s, was extremely neglected in
GREECE after the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the ROMAN em|pire;

city-guard, to prevent mobbi&s;h di&s;orders, 'tis all they
had occa&s;ion for: And the&s;e, perhaps, did not amount
to 3000 men, thro'out all GREECE. I own, that if
PLUTARCH had this fact in his eye, he is here
guilty of a very gro&s;s paralogi&s;m, and a&s;&s;igns cau&s;es
no way proportioned to the effects. But is it &s;o great
a prodigy, that an author &s;hould fall into a mi&s;take

'Tis wrote in dialogue, which is a method of compo&s;ition that PLUTARCH commonly little af|fects. The per&s;onages he introduces advance very wild, ab&s;urd, and contradictory opinions, more like the vi&s;ionary &s;y&s;tems or ravings of PLATO than the &s;olid &s;en&s;e of PLUTARCH. There runs al&s;o thro' the whole an air of &s;uper&s;tition and credulity, which re&s;embles very little the &s;pirit that appears in other phi|lo&s;ophical compo&s;itions of that author. For 'tis remarkable, that tho' PLUTARCH be an hi&s;torian as &s;uper&s;titious as HERO|DOTUS or LIVY, yet there is &s;carcely, in all antiquity, a philo|&s;opher le&s;s &s;uper&s;titious, excepting CICERO and LUCIAN. I mu&s;t therefore confe&s;s, that a pa&s;&s;age of PLUTARCH, cited from this di&s;cour&s;e, has much le&s;s authority with me, than if it had been found in mo&s;t of his other compo&s;itions.</P>
<P>There is only one other di&s;cour&s;e of PLUTARCH liable to like objections, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>concerning tho&s;e who&s;e puni&s;hment is delayed by the Deity.</HI> It is al&s;o wrote in dialogue, contains like &s;uper|&s;titious, wild vi&s;ions, and &s;eems to have been chiefly compo&s;ed in rival&s;hip to PLATO, particularly his la&s;t book, <HI>de republica.</HI></P>
<P>And here I cannot but ob&s;erve, that Mon&s; FONTENELLE, a writer eminent for candor, &s;eems to have departed a little from his u&s;ual character, when he endeavours to throw a ridicule up|on PLUTARCH on account of pa&s;&s;ages to be met with in this dialogue concerning oracles. The ab&s;urdities here put into the mouths of the &s;everal per&s;onages are not to be a&s;cribed to PLU|TARCH.

without a philo&s;ophical or &s;peculative &s;y&s;tem of

we accordingly find, that each of the parties, into

properly &s;peaking, be called his vicegerent, in
any other &s;en&s;e than every power or force, being de|rived
from him, may be &s;aid to act by his commi&s;&s;ion.
Whatever actually happens is comprehended in the
general plan or intention of providence; nor has the
greate&s;t and mo&s;t lawful prince any more rea&s;on, up|on
that account, to plead a peculiar &s;acredne&s;s or in|violable
authority, than an inferior magi&s;trate, or even
an u&s;urper, or even a robber and a pyrate. The &s;ame
divine &s;uper-intendant, who, for wi&s;e purpo&s;es, in|ve&s;ted
an ELIZABETH or a HENRY<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">HENRY the 4th of FRANCE.</NOTE> with authority,
did al&s;o, for purpo&s;es, no doubt, equally wi&s;e, tho'
unknown, be&s;tow power on a BORGIA or an ANGRIA.
The &s;ame cau&s;es, which gave ri&s;e to the &s;overeign
power in every &s;tate, e&s;tabli&s;hed likewi&s;e every petty
juri&s;diction in it, and every limited Authority. A
con&s;table therefore, no le&s;s than a king, acts by a
divine commi&s;&s;ion, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es an inde&s;ea&s;ible right.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider how nearly equal all men are
in their bodily force, and even in their mental pow|ers
and faculties, till cultivated by education; we mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily allow, that nothing but their own con&s;ent
<PB N="290" REF="289">
could, at fir&s;t, a&s;&s;ociate them together, and &s;ubject
them to any authority. The people, if we trace up
government to its first origin in the woods and de&s;erts,
are the &s;ource of all power and juri&s;diction, and vo|luntarily,
for the &s;ake of peace and order, abandoned
their native liberty, and received laws from their equal
and companion. The conditions, upon which they
were willing to &s;ubmit, were either expre&s;t, or were
&s;o clear and obvious, that it might well be e&s;teemed
&s;uperfluous to expre&s;s them. If this, then, be meant
by the <HI>original contract,</HI> it cannot be denied, that all
government is, at fir&s;t, founded on a contract, and
that the mo&s;t ancient rude combinations of mankind
were formed entirely by that principle. In vain, are
we &s;ent to the records to &s;eek for this charter of our
liberties. It was not wrote on parchment, nor yet on
leaves or barks of trees. It preceded the u&s;e of writ|ing
and all the other civilized arts of life. But we
trace it plainly in the nature of man, and in the equa|lity,
which we find in all the individuals of that &s;pe|cies.
The force, which now prevails, and which is
founded on fleets and armies, is plainly political, and
derived from authority, the effect of e&s;tabli&s;hed go|vernment.
A man's natural force con&s;i&s;ts only in the
vigour of his limbs, and the firmne&s;s of his courage;
which could never &s;ubject multitudes to the command
of one. Nothing but their own con&s;ent, and their
&s;en&s;e of the advantages of peace and order, could have
had that influence.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="290">
BUT philo&s;ophers, who have embraced a party (if
that be not a contradiction in terms) are not con|tented
with the&s;e conce&s;&s;ions. They a&s;&s;ert, not only
that government in its earlie&s;t infancy aro&s;e from con|&s;ent,
or the voluntary combination of the people; but
al&s;o, that, even at pre&s;ent, when it has attained its
full maturity, it re&s;ts on no other foundation. They
affirm, that all men are &s;till born equal, and owe al|legiance
to no prince or government, unle&s;s bound by
the obligation and &s;anction of a <HI>promi&s;e.</HI> And as no
man, without &s;ome equivalent, would forego the ad|vantages
of his native liberty, and &s;ubject him&s;elf to
the will of another; this promi&s;e is always under&s;tood
to be conditional, and impo&s;es on him no obligation,
unle&s;s he meets with ju&s;tice and protection from his
&s;overeign. The&s;e advantages the &s;overeign promi&s;es
him in return; and if he fails in the execution, he has
broke, on his &s;ide, the articles of engagement, and
has thereby freed his &s;ubjects from all obligations to
allegiance Such, according to the&s;e philo&s;ophers, is
the foundation of authority in every government; and
&s;uch the right of re&s;i&s;tance, po&s;&s;e&s;t by every &s;ubject.</P>
<P>BUT would the&s;e rea&s;oners look abroad into the
world, they would meet with nothing that, in the
lea&s;t, corre&s;ponds to their ideas, or can warrant &s;o re|fined
and philo&s;ophical a &s;y&s;em. On the contrary,
we find, every where, princes, who claim their &s;ub|jects
<PB N="292" REF="291">
as their property, and a&s;&s;ert their independent
right of &s;overeignty, from conque&s;t or &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. We
find al&s;o, every where, &s;ubjects, who acknowledge
this right in their princes, and &s;uppo&s;e them&s;elves born
under obligations of obedience to a certain &s;overeign,
as much as under the ties of reverence and duty to
certain parents. The&s;e connexions are always con|ceived
to be equally independent of our con&s;ent, in
PERSIA and CHINA; in FRANCE and SPAIN; and
even in HOLLAND and ENGLAND, wherever the doc|trines
abovementioned have not been carefully incul|cated.
Obedience or &s;ubjection becomes &s;o familiar,
that mo&s;t men never make any enquiry about its ori|gin
or cau&s;e, more than about the principle of gravity,
re&s;i&s;tance, or the mo&s;t univer&s;al laws of nature. Or
if curio&s;ity ever move them; &s;o &s;oon as they learn,
that they them&s;elves and their ance&s;tors have, for &s;e|veral
ages, or from time immemorial, been &s;ubject to
&s;uch a government or &s;uch a family; they immedi|ately
acquie&s;ce, and acknowledge their obligation to
allegiance. Were you to preach, in mo&s;t parts of the
world, that political connexions are founded altoge|ther
on voluntary con&s;ent or a mutual promi&s;e, the ma|gi&s;trate
would &s;oon impri&s;on you, as &s;editious, for
loo&s;ening the tyes of obedience; if your friends did
not before &s;hut you up, as delirious, for advance|ing
&s;uch ab&s;urdities. 'Tis &s;trange, that an act of the
mind, which every individual is &s;uppo&s;ed to have
formed, and after he came to the u&s;e of rea&s;on too,
<PB N="293" REF="292">
otherwi&s;e it could have no authority; that this act, I
&s;ay, &s;hould be &s;o unknown to all of them, that over
the face of the whole earth there &s;carce remain any
traces or memory of it.</P>
<P>BUT the contract, on which government is founded,
is &s;aid to be the <HI>original contract;</HI> and con&s;equently
may be &s;uppo&s;ed too old to fall under the knowledge
of the pre&s;ent generation. If the agreement, by
which &s;avage men fir&s;t a&s;&s;ociated and conjoined their
force, be here meant, this is acknowledged to be real;
but being &s;o antient, and being obliterated by a thou|&s;and
changes of government and princes, it cannot
now be &s;uppo&s;ed to retain any authority. If we would
&s;ay any thing to the purpo&s;e, we mu&s;t a&s;&s;ert, that
every particular government, which is lawful, and
which impo&s;es any duty of allegiance on the &s;ubject,
was, at fir&s;t, founded on con&s;ent and a voluntary com|pact.
But be&s;ides that this &s;uppo&s;es the con&s;ent of
the fathers to bind the children, even to the mo&s;t re|more
generations (which republican writers will never
allow) be&s;ides this, I &s;ay, it is not ju&s;tified by hi&s;tory
or experience, in any age or country of the world.</P>
<P>ALMOST all the governments, which exi&s;t at pre|&s;ent,
or of which there remains any record in &s;tory,
have been founded originally, either on u&s;urpation or
conque&s;t, or both, without any pretence of a fair con|&s;ent,
or voluntary &s;ubjection of the people. When
<PB N="294" REF="293">
an artful and bold man is placed at the head of an
army or faction, 'tis often ea&s;y for him, by employing
&s;ometimes violence, &s;ometimes fal&s;e pretences, to e&s;ta|bli&s;h
his dominion over a people a hundred times more
numerous than his partizans. He allows no &s;uch open
communication, that his enemies can know, with cer|tainty,
their number of force. He gives them no
lei&s;ure to a&s;&s;emble together in a body to oppo&s;e him.
Even all tho&s;e, who are the in&s;truments of his u&s;urpa|tion,
may with his fall; but their ignorance of each
other's intention keeps them in awe, and is the &s;ole
cau&s;e of his &s;ecurity. By &s;uch arts as the&s;e many go|vernments
have been e&s;tabli&s;hed; and this is all the
<HI>original contract,</HI> which they have to boa&s;t of.</P>
<P>THE face of the earth is continually changing, by
the encrea&s;e of &s;mall kingdoms into great empires,
by the di&s;&s;olution of great empires into &s;maller king|doms,
by the planting of colonies, by the migration
of tribes. Is there any thing di&s;coverable in all the&s;e
events, but force and violence? Where is the mu|tual
agreement or voluntary a&s;&s;ociation &s;o much talked
of?</P>
<P>EVEN the &s;moothe&s;t way, by which a nation may
receive a foreign ma&s;ter, by marriage or a will, is not
extremely honourable for the people; but &s;uppo&s;es
<PB N="295" REF="294">
them to be di&s;po&s;ed of, like a dowry or a legacy,
according to the plea&s;ure or intere&s;t of their rulers.</P>
<P>BUT where no force interpo&s;es, and election takes
place; what is this election &s;o highly vaunted? 'Tis
either the combination of a few great men, who de|cide
for the whole, and will allow of no oppo&s;ition:
Or 'tis the fury of a rabble, that follow a &s;editious
ringleader, who is not known, perhaps, to a dozen
among them, and who owes his advancement merely
to his own impudence, or to the momentary caprice
of his fellows.</P>
<P>ARE the&s;e di&s;orderly elections, which are rare too,
of &s;uch mighty authority, as to be the only lawful
foundation of all government and allegiance?</P>
<P>IN reality, there is not a more terrible event, than
a total di&s;&s;olution of government, which gives liberty
to the multitude, and makes the determination or
choice of the new e&s;tabli&s;hment depend upon a number
which nearly approaches the body of the people: For
it never comes entirely to the whole body of them.
Every wi&s;e man, then, wi&s;hes to &s;ee, at the head of
a powerful and obedient army, a general, who may
&s;peedily &s;eize the prize, and give to the people a
ma&s;ter, which they are &s;o unfit to choo&s;e for them|&s;elves.
So little corre&s;pondent is fact and reality to
tho&s;e philo&s;ophical notions.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="295">
LET not the e&s;tabli&s;hment at the <HI>revolution,</HI> deceive
us, or make us &s;o much in love with a philo&s;ophical
origin to government, as to imagine all others mon|&s;trous
and irregular. Even that event was far from
corre&s;ponding to the&s;e refined ideas. It was only the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and that only in the regal part of the go|vernment,
which was then changed: And it was only
the majority of &s;even hundred, who determined that
change for near ten millions. I doubt not, indeed,
but the bulk, of the&s;e ten millions acquie&s;ced wil|lingly
in the determination: But was the matter left,
in the lea&s;t, to their choice? Was it not ju&s;tly &s;up|po&s;ed
to be, from that moment, decided, and every
man puni&s;hed, who refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the new &s;o|vereign?
How otherways could the matter have ever
been brought to any i&s;&s;ue or conclu&s;ion?</P>
<P>THE republic of ATHENS was, I believe, the mo&s;t
exten&s;ive democracy, which we read of in hi&s;tory:
Yet if we make the requi&s;ite allowances for the wo|men,
the &s;laves, and the &s;trangers, we &s;hall find, that
that e&s;tabli&s;hment was not, at fir&s;t, made, nor any
law ever voted, by a tenth part of tho&s;e, who are
bound to pay obedience to it. Not to mention the
i&s;lands and foreign dominions, which the ATHENIANS
claimed as theirs by right of conque&s;t. And as 'tis
well known, that popular a&s;&s;emblies in that city were
always full of licence and di&s;order, notwith&s;tanding
the forms and laws by which they were checked:
<PB N="297" REF="296">
How much more di&s;orderly mu&s;t they be, where they
form not the e&s;tabli&s;hed con&s;titution, but a&s;&s;emble tu|multuou&s;ly
on the di&s;&s;olution of the antient govern|ment,
in order to give ri&s;e to a new one? How chi|merical
mu&s;t it be to talk of a choice in any &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances?</P>
<P>THE ACHAEANS enjoyed the free&s;t and mo&s;t perfect
democracy of all antiquity; yet they employed force
to oblige &s;ome cities to enter into their league, as
we learn from POLYBIUS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Lib. 2. cap. 38.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>HARRY the IVth and HARRY the VIIthe of ENG|LAND,
had really no other title to the throne but a
parlimentary election; yet they never would acknow|ledge
it, for fear of weakening their authority.
Strange! if the only real foundation of all autho|rity
be con&s;ent and promi&s;e.</P>
<P>'TIS in vain to &s;ay, that all governments are, or
&s;hould be, at fir&s;t, founded on popular con&s;ent, as
much as the nece&s;&s;ity of human affairs will admit.
This favours entirely my preten&s;ion. I maintain,
that human affairs never will admit of this con&s;ent;
&s;eldom of the appearance of it: But that conque&s;t or
u&s;urpation, that is, in plain terms, force, by di&s;&s;olv|ing
the antient governments, is the origin of almo&s;t
all the new ones, which ever were e&s;tabli&s;hed in the
<PB N="298" REF="297">
world. And that in the few ca&s;es, where con&s;ent may
&s;eem to have taken place, it was commonly &s;o irre|gular,
&s;o confined, or &s;o much intermixed either
with fraud or violence, that it cannot have any great
authority.</P>
<P>MY intention here is not to exclude the con&s;ent of
the people from being one ju&s;t foundation of govern|ment
where it has place. It is &s;urely the be&s;t and
mo&s;t &s;acred of any. I only pretend, that it has very
&s;eldom had place in any degree, and never almo&s;t in
its full extent. And that therefore &s;ome other foun|dation
of government mu&s;t al&s;o be admitted.</P>
<P>WERE all men po&s;&s;e&s;t of &s;o inflexible a regard to
ju&s;tice, that, of them&s;elves, they would totally ab&s;tain
from the properties of others; they had for ever re|mained
in a &s;tate of ab&s;olute liberty, without &s;ubjec|tion
to any magi&s;trates or political &s;ociety: But this is
a &s;tate of perfection, of which human nature is ju&s;tly
e&s;teemed incapable. Again; were all men po&s;&s;e&s;t of
&s;o perfect an under&s;tanding, as always to know their
own intere&s;t, no form of government had ever been
&s;ubmitted to, but what was e&s;tabli&s;hed on con&s;ent,
and was fully canva&s;t by each member of the &s;ociety:
But this &s;tate of perfection is likewi&s;e much &s;uperior
to human nature. Rea&s;on, hi&s;tory and experience
&s;how us, that all political &s;ocieties have had an origin
much le&s;s accurate and regular; and were one to choo&s;e
<PB N="299" REF="298">
a period of time, when the people's con&s;ent was lea&s;t
regarded in public transfactions, it would be preci&s;ely
on the e&s;tabli&s;hment of a new government. In a
&s;ettled con&s;titution, their inclinations are often &s;tudied;
but during the fury of revolutions, conque&s;ts, and
public convul&s;ions, military force or political craft
u&s;ually decides the controver&s;y.</P>
<P>WHEN a new government is e&s;tabli&s;hed, by what|ever
means, the people are commonly di&s;&s;atisfied with
it, and pay obedience more from fear and nece&s;&s;ity,
than from any idea of allegiance or of moral obliga|tion.
The prince is watchful and jealous, and mu&s;t
carefully guard again&s;t every beginning or appear|ance
of in&s;urrection. Time, by degrees, removes all
the&s;e difficulties, and accu&s;toms the nation to regard,
as their lawful or native princes, that family, whom,
at fir&s;t, they con&s;idered as u&s;urpers or foreign conque|rors.
In order to found this opinion, they have no
recour&s;e to any notion of voluntary con&s;ent or pro|mi&s;e,
which, they know, never was, in this ca&s;e,
either expected or demanded. The original e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
was formed by violence, and &s;ubmitted to from
nece&s;&s;ity. The &s;ub&s;equent admini&s;tration is al&s;o &s;up|ported
by power, and acquie&s;ced in by the people,
not as a matter of choice, but of obligation. They
imagine not, that their con&s;ent gives their prince a
title: But they willingly con&s;ent, becau&s;e they think,
<PB N="300" REF="299">
that, from long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, he has acquired a title in|dependent
of their choice or inclination.</P>
<P>SHOULD it be &s;aid, that by living under the domi|nion
of a prince, which one might leave, every indi|vidual
has given a <HI>tacit</HI> con&s;ent to his authority, and
promi&s;ed him obedience; it may be an&s;wered, That
&s;uch implied con&s;ent can only take place, where a
man imagines, that the matter depends on his choice.
But where he thinks (as all mankind do who are born
under e&s;tabli&s;hed governments) that by his birth he
owes allegiance to a certain prince or certain govern|ment;
it would be ab&s;urd to infer a con&s;ent or choice,
which he expre&s;ly, in this ca&s;e, renounces and ab|jures.</P>
<P>CAN
we &s;eriou&s;ly &s;ay, that a poor pea&s;ant or arti|zan
has a free choice to leave his own country, when
he knows no foreign language or manners, and lives
from day to day, by the &s;mall wages which he ac|quires?
We may as well a&s;&s;ert, that a man, by re|maining
in a ve&s;&s;el, freely con&s;ents to the dominion
of the ma&s;ter; tho' he was carried on board while
a&s;leep, and mu&s;t leap into the ocean, and peri&s;h, the
moment he leaves her.</P>
<P>WHAT if the prince forbid his &s;ubjects to quit his
dominions; as in TIBERIUS's time, it was regarded
as a crime in a ROMAN knight that he had attempted
to fly to the PARTHIANS, in order to e&s;cape the ty|ranny
<PB N="301" REF="300">
of that emperor<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">TACIT. Ann. 6. cap. 14.</NOTE>? Or as the antient MUSCO|VITES
prohibited all travelling under pain of death?
And did a prince ob&s;erve, that many of his &s;ubjects
were &s;eized with the frenzy of tran&s;porting them&s;elves
to foreign nations, he would doubtle&s;s, with great
rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, re&s;train them, in order to prevent
the depopulation of his own country. Would he for|feit
the allegiance of all his &s;ubjects, by &s;o wi&s;e and
rea&s;onable a law? Yet the freedom of their choice
is &s;urely, in that ca&s;e, ravi&s;hed from them.</P>
<P>A COMPANY of men, who &s;hould leave their na|tive
country, in order to people &s;ome uninhabited re|gion,
might dream of recovering their native free|dom;
but they would &s;oon find, that their prince
&s;till laid claim to them, and called them his &s;ubjects,
even in their new &s;ettlement. And in this he would
but act conformably to the common ideas of mankind.</P>
<P>THE true&s;t <HI>tacit</HI> con&s;ent of this kind, which is ever
ob&s;erved, is when a foreigner &s;ettles in any country,
and is beforehand acquainted with the prince, and
government, and laws, to which he mu&s;t &s;ubmit:
Yet is his allegiance, tho' more voluntary, much le&s;s
expected or depended on, than that of a natural born
&s;ubject. On the contrary, his native prince &s;till a&s;&s;erts
a claim to him. And if he puni&s;hes not the renegade,
<PB N="302" REF="301">
when he &s;eizes him in war with his new prince's com|mi&s;&s;ion;
this clemency is not founded on the muni|cipal
law, which in all countries condemns the pri|&s;oner;
but on the con&s;ent of princes, who have
agreed to this indulgence, in order to prevent re|pri&s;als.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE an u&s;urper, after having bani&s;hed his law|ful
prince and royal family, &s;hould e&s;tabli&s;h his domi|nion
for ten or a dozen years in any country, and
&s;hould pre&s;erve &s;uch exact di&s;cipline in his troops, and
&s;o regular a di&s;po&s;ition in his garri&s;ons, that no in&s;ur|rection
had ever been rai&s;ed, or even murmur heard,
again&s;t his admini&s;tration: Can it be a&s;&s;erted, that the
people, who in their hearts abhor his trea&s;on, have
$word$ con&s;ented to his authority, and promi&s;ed him
allegiance, merely becau&s;e, from nece&s;&s;ity, they live
under his dominion? Suppo&s;e again their natural
prince re&s;tored, by means of an army, which he a&s;|&s;embles
in foreign countries: They receive him with
joy and ex$ltation, and &s;hew plainly with what reluc|tance
they had &s;ubmitted to any other yoke. I may
now a&s;k, upon what foundation the prince's title-&s;tands?
Not on popular con&s;ent &s;urely: For tho' the
people willingly acquie&s;ce in his authority, they never
imagine, that their con&s;ent makes him &s;overeign.
They con&s;ent; becau&s;e they apprehend him to be al|ready,
by birth, their lawful &s;overeign. And as to
<PB N="303" REF="302">
that tacit con&s;ent, which may now be inferred from
their living under his dominion, this is no more than
what they formerly gave to the tyrant and u&s;urper.</P>
<P>WHEN we a&s;&s;ert, that all lawful government ari&s;es
from the people, we certainly do them a great deal
more honour than they de&s;erve, or even expect and
de&s;ire from us. After the ROMAN dominions became
too unwieldy for the republic to govern, the people,
over the whole known world, were extremely grate|ful
to AUGUSTUS for that authority, which, by vio|lence,
he e&s;tabli&s;hed over them; and they &s;hewed an
equal di&s;po&s;ition to &s;ubmit to the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, whom he
left them, by his la&s;t will and te&s;tament. It was af|terwards
their misfortune, that there never was, in
one family, any long regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion; but that their
line of princes was continually broke, either by pri|vate
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations or public rebellions. The <HI>praeto|r$an</HI>
bands, on the failure of every family, &s;et up
one emperor; the legions in the Ea&s;t a &s;econd; tho&s;e
in GERMANY, perhaps, a third: And the &s;word alone
could decide the controver&s;y. The condition of the
people, in that mighty monarchy, was to be lamented,
not becau&s;e the choice of the emperor was never left
to them; for that was impracticable: But becau&s;e they

inevitable.</P>
<P>THE hou&s;e of LANCASTER ruled in this i&s;land
about &s;ixty years; yet the partizans of the white ro&s;e
&s;eemed daily to multiply in ENGLAND. The pre&s;ent
e&s;tabli&s;hment has taken place during a &s;till longer pe|riod.
Have all views of right in another family been
utterly extingui&s;hed; even tho' &s;carce any man now
alive had arrived at years of di&s;cretion, when it was
expelled, or could have con&s;ented to its dominion,
or have promi&s;ed it allegiance? A &s;ufficient indica|tion
&s;urely of the general &s;entiment of mankind on
this head. For we blame not the partizans of the
abdicated family, merely on account of the long time,
during which they have pre&s;erved their imaginary
fidelity. We blame them for adhering to a family,
which, we affirm, has been ju&s;tly expelled, and which,
from the moment the new &s;ettlement took place, had
forfeited all title to authority.</P>
<P>BUT would we have a more regular, at lea&s;t, a
more philo&s;ophical refutation of this principle of an
original contract or popular con&s;ent; perhaps, the fol|lowing
ob&s;ervations may &s;uffice.</P>
<P>ALL <HI>moral</HI> duties may be divided into two kinds.
The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> are tho&s;e, to which men are impelled by a
natural in&s;tinct or immediate propen&s;ity, which ope|rates
<PB N="305" REF="308">
in them, independent of all ideas of obligation,
and of all views, either to public or private utility.
Of this nature are, love of children, gratitude to be|nefactors,
pity to the unfortunate. When we reflect
on the advantage, which re&s;ults to &s;ociety from &s;uch
humane in&s;tincts, we pay them the ju&s;t tribute of mo|ral
approbation and e&s;teem: But the per&s;on, actuated
by them, feels their power and influence, antecedent
to any &s;uch reflection.</P>
<P>THE <HI>&s;econd</HI> kind of moral duties are &s;uch as are
not &s;upported by any original in&s;tinct of nature, but
are performed entirely from a &s;en&s;e of obligation,
when we con&s;ider the nece&s;&s;itie of human &s;ociety,
and the impo&s;&s;ibility of &s;upporting it, if the&s;e duties
were neglected. 'Tis thus <HI>ju&s;tice</HI> or a regard to the
property of others, <HI>fidelity</HI> or the ob&s;ervance of pro|mi&s;es,
become obligatory, and acquire an authority
over mankind. For as 'tis evident, that every man
loves him&s;elf better than any other per&s;on, he is na|turally
impelled to extend his acqui&s;itions as much as
po&s;&s;ible; and nothing can re&s;train him in this propen|&s;ity,
but reflection and experience, by which he learns
the pernicious effects of that licence, and the total di&s;|&s;olution
of &s;ociety, which mu&s;t en&s;ue from it. His ori|ginal
inclination, therefore, or in&s;tinct, is here checked
and re&s;trained by a &s;ub&s;equent judgment or ob&s;er|vation.</P>
<P><PB N="306" REF="309">
THE ca&s;e is preci&s;ely the &s;ame with the political or
civil duty of <HI>allegiance,</HI> as with the natural duties of
ju&s;tice and fidelity. Our primary in&s;tincts lead us, ei|ther
to indulge our&s;elves in unlimited liberty, or to
&s;eek dominion over others: And 'tis reflection only,
which engages us to &s;acrifice &s;uch &s;trong pa&s;&s;ions to
the intere&s;ts of peace and order. A very &s;mall de|gree
of experience and ob&s;ervation &s;uffices to teach us,
that &s;ociety cannot po&s;&s;ibly be maintained without
the authority of magi&s;trates, and that this authority
mu&s;t &s;oon fall into contempt, where exact obedience
is not payed to it. The ob&s;ervation of the&s;e gene|r$l
and obvious intere&s;ts is the &s;ource of all all$|giance,
and of that moral obligation, which we at|tribute
to it.</P>
<P>WHAT nece&s;&s;ity, therefore, is there to found the
duty of <HI>allegiance</HI> or obedience to magi&s;trates on that
of <HI>fidelity</HI> or a regard to promi&s;es, and to &s;uppo&s;e,
that 'tis the con&s;ent of each individual, which &s;ubjects
$im to government; when it appears, that both alle|giance
and fidelity &s;tand preci&s;ely on the &s;ame foun|dation,
and are both &s;ubmitted to by mankind, on
account of the apparent intere&s;ts and necc&s;&s;ities of hu|man
&s;ociety? We are bound to obey our &s;overeign,
'tis &s;aid; becau&s;e we have given a tacit promi&s;e to
that purpo&s;e. But why are we bound to ob&s;erve our
promi&s;e? It mu&s;t here be a&s;&s;erted, that the commerce
and intercour&s;e of mankind, which are of &s;uch mighty
<PB N="307" REF="310">
advantage, can have no &s;ecurity where men pay no re|gard
to their engagements. In like manner, may it
be &s;aid, that men could not live at all in &s;ociety, at
lea&s;t in a civilized &s;ociety without laws and magi&s;trates
and judges, to prevent the encroachments of the
&s;trong upon the weak, of the violent upon the ju&s;t
and equitable. The obligation to allegiance, being
of like force and authority with the obligation to
fidelity, we gain nothing by re&s;olving the one into
the other. The general intere&s;ts or nece&s;&s;ities of &s;o|ciety
are &s;ufficient to e&s;tabli&s;h both.</P>
<P>IF the rea&s;on is a&s;ked of that obedience, which we
are bound to pay to government, I readily an&s;wer:
<HI>becau&s;e &s;oci$ty could not otherwi&s;e &s;ab&s;i&s;t:</HI> And this an|&s;wer
is clear and intelligible to all mankind. Your
an&s;wer is, <HI>becau&s;e we &s;hould keep our word.</HI> But be|&s;ides,
that no body, till trained in a philo&s;ophical &s;y&s;|tem,
can either comprehend or reli&s;h this an&s;wer: Be|&s;ides
this, I &s;ay, you find your&s;elf embarra&s;&s;ed, when
'tis a&s;ked, <HI>why we are bound to keep our word?</HI> And
you can give no other an&s;wer, but what would, im|mediately,
without any circuit, have accounted for
our obligation to allegiance.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>to whom is allegiance due? And who are our
lawful &s;overeigns?</HI> This que&s;tion is often the mo&s;t
difficult of any, and liable to infinite di&s;cu&s;&s;ions. When
people are &s;o happy, that they can an&s;wer, <HI>Our pre|&s;ent
<PB N="308" REF="311">
&s;overeign, who inherits, in a direct, line, from an|ce&s;ters,
that have governed us for many ages;</HI> this an|&s;wer
admits of no reply; even tho' hi&s;torians, in trac|ing
up to the remote&s;t antiquity the origin of that
royal family, may find, as commonly happens, that
its fir&s;t authority was derived from u&s;urpation and vi|olence.
'Tis confe&s;t, that private ju&s;tice or the ab|&s;tinence
from the properties of others, is a mo&s;t car|dinal
virtue: Yet rea&s;on tells, that there is no pro|perty
in durable objects, &s;uch as lands or hou&s;es, when
carefully examined in pa&s;&s;ing from hand to hand, but
mu&s;t, in &s;ome period, have been founded on fraud
and inju&s;tice. The nece&s;&s;ities of human &s;ociety, nei|ther
in private nor public life, will allow of &s;uch an
accurate enquiry: And there is no virtue or moral
duty, but what may, with facility, be refined away,
if we indulge a fal&s;e philo&s;ophy, in &s;ifting and &s;cruti|nizing
it, by every captious rule of logic, in every
light or po&s;ition, in which it may be placed.</P>
<P>THE que&s;tions with regard to private property have
filled infinite volumes of law and philo&s;ophy, if in
both we add the commentators to the original text;
and in the end, we may &s;afely pronounce, that many
of the rules, there e&s;tabli&s;hed, are uncertain, ambi|guous,
and arbitrary. The like opinion may be
formed with regard to the &s;ucce&s;&s;ions and rights of
princes and forms of government. Many ca&s;es, no
doubt, occur, e&s;pecially in the infancy of any go|vernment,
<PB N="309" REF="312">
which admit of no determination from the
laws of ju&s;tice and equity: And our hi&s;torian RAPIN,
allows, that the controver&s;y between EDWARD the
the third and PHILLIP de VALOIS was of this nature,
and could be decided only by an appeal to heaven,
that is, by war and violence.</P>
<P>WHO &s;hall tell me, whether GERMANICUS or
DRUSUS ought to have &s;ucceeded TIBERIUS, had he
died, while they were both alive, without naming
any of them for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or? Ought the right of
adoption to be received as equivalent to that of blood,
in a nation, where it had the &s;ame effect in private
families, and had already, in two in&s;tances, taken
place in the public? Ought GERMANICUS to be
e&s;teemed the elde&s;t &s;on becau&s;e he was born before
DRUSUS; or the younger, becau&s;e he was adopted
after the birth of his brother? Ought the right of the
elder to be regarded in a nation, where the elde&s;t bro|ther
had no advantage in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of private fa|milies?
Ought the ROMAN empire, at that time,
to be e&s;teemed hereditary, becau&s;e of two examples;
or ought it, even &s;o early, to be regarded as belong|ing
to the &s;tronger or the pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or, as being
founded on &s;o recent an u&s;urpation?</P>
<P>COMMODUS mounted the throne after a pretty long
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of excellent emperors, who had acquired
their title, not by birth, or public election, but by the
<PB N="310" REF="313">
fictitious rite of adoption. That bloody debauchee
being murdered by a con&s;piracy &s;uddenly formed be|tween
his wench and her gallant, who happened at
that time to be <HI>Praetorian Pr$$fect,</HI> or to have the
command of the guards; the&s;e immediately delibe|rated
about choo&s;ing a ma&s;ter to human kind, to &s;peak
in the &s;tyle of tho&s;e ages; and ca&s;t their eyes on
PERTINAX. Before the tyrant's death was known,
the <HI>Praefect</HI> went &s;ecretly to that &s;enator, who, on the
appearance of the &s;oldiers, imagined that his execu|tion
had been ordered by COMMODUS. He was im|mediately
&s;aluted emperor by the officer and his at|tendants;
chearfully proclaimed by the populace;
unwillingly &s;ubmitted to by the guards; formally re|cognized
by the &s;enate; and pa&s;&s;ively received by the
provinces and armies of the empire.</P>
<P>THE di&s;content of the <HI>Praetorian</HI> bands &s;oon broke
out in a &s;udden &s;edition, which occa&s;ioned the mur|ther
of that excellent prince: And the world being
now without a ma&s;ter and without government, the
guards thought proper to &s;et the empire formally to
&s;$le. JULIAN, the purcha&s;er, was proclaimed by the
&s;oldiers, recognized by the &s;enate, and &s;ubmitted to
by the people, and mu&s;t al&s;o have been &s;ubmitted to
by the provinces, had not the envy of the legions
begot oppo&s;ition and re&s;i&s;tance. PESCENNIUS NI|GER
in SYRIA elected him&s;elf emperor, gained the
<PB N="311" REF="314">
tumultuary con&s;ent of his army, and was attended
with the &s;ecret good-will of the &s;enate and people of
ROME. ALBINUS in BRITAIN found an equal right
to &s;et up his claim; but SEVERUS, who governed
PANNONIA, prevailed in the end above both of them.
That able politician and warrior, finding his own
birth and dignity too much inferior to the imperial
crown, profe&s;t at fir&s;t, an intention only of revenging
the death of PERTINAX. He marched as general in|to
ITALY, defeated JULIAN; and without our be|ing
able to fix any preci&s;e commencement even of the
&s;oldiers con&s;ent, he was from nece&s;&s;ity acknowledged
emperor by the &s;enate and people; and fully e&s;ta|bil&s;hed
in his violent authority by &s;ubduing NIGER
and ALBINUS<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">HERODIAN, lib. 2.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>Inter baec Gordi$nus</HI> CAESAR (&s;ays CAPITOLINUS,

<HI>e&s;t appellatus, quia non erat alius in prae&s;enti.</HI>
'Tis to be remarked that GORDIAN was a boy of
fourteen years of age.</P>
<P>FREQUENT in&s;tances of a like nature occur in the
hi&s;tory of the emperors; in that of ALEXANDER's
&s;ucce&s;&s;ors; and of many other countries: Nor can any
thing be more unhappy than a de&s;potic government
of that kind; where the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is disjointed and
irregular, and mu&s;t be determined, on every occa&s;ion,
<PB N="312" REF="315">
by force or election. In a free government, the mat|ter
is often unavoidable, and is al&s;o much le&s;s dange|rous.
The intere&s;ts of liberty may there frequently
lead the people, in their own defence, to alter the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ien
of the crown. And the con&s;titution, being
compounded of parts, may &s;till maintain a &s;ufficient
&s;tability, by re&s;ting on the ari&s;tocratical or democra|tical
members, tho' the monarchical be altered, from
time to time, in order to accommodate it to the
former.</P>
<P>IN an ab&s;olute government, when there is no legal
prince, who has a title to the throne, it may &s;afely
be determined to belong to the fir&s;t occupier. In|&s;tances
of this kind are but too frequent, e&s;pecially in
the ea&s;tern monarchies. When any race of princes
expires, the will or de&s;tination of the la&s;t &s;overeign
will be regarded as a title. Thus the edict of LEWIS
the XIVth, who called the ba&s;tard prince to the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion
in ca&s;e of the failure of all the legitimate
princes, would, in &s;uch an event, have &s;ome autho|rity<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">'Tis remarkable, that in the remon&s;trance of the duke of BOUR$ON and the legitimate princes, again&s;t this de&s;tination of LOUIS the XIVth, the doctrine of the <HI>original contract</HI> is in&s;i&s;ted on, even in that ab&s;olute government. The FRENCH nation, &s;ay they, choo&s;ing HUGH CAPET and his po&s;terity to rule over them and their po&s;terity, where the former line &s;ails, there is a tacit right re&s;erved to choo&s;e a new royal family; and this right is invaded by calling the ba&s;tard princes to the throne, without the con&s;ent of the nation. But the Compte de BOULAINVIL|LIERS, who wrote in defence of the ba&s;tard princes, ridicules this notion of an original contract, e&s;pecially when applied to HUGH CAPET; who mounted the throne, &s;ays he, by the &s;ame arts, which have ever been employed by all conquerors and u&s;urp|ers. He got his title, indeed, recognized by the &s;tates after he had put him&s;elf in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: But is this a choice or contract? The Compte de BOULAINVILLIERS, we may ob&s;erve, was a noted republican; but being a man of learning, and very con|ver&s;ant in hi&s;tory, he knew the people were never almo&s;t con|&s;ulted in the&s;e revolutions and new e&s;tabli&s;hments, and that time alone be&s;towed right and authority on what was commonly at fir&s;t founded on foroe and violence. <HI>See Etai de la</HI> FRANCE, Vol. III.</NOTE>. Thus the will of CHARLES the &s;econd dis|po&s;ed
<PB N="313" REF="316">
of the whole SPANISH monarchy. The ce&s;&s;ion
of the antient proprietor, e&s;pecially when joined to
conque&s;t, is likewi&s;e e&s;teemed a very good title. The
general bond or obligation, which binds us to govern|ment,
is the intere&s;t and nece&s;&s;ities of &s;ociety; and
this obligation is very &s;trong. The determination of
it to this or that particular prince or form of govern|ment
is frequently more uncertain and dubious. Pre|&s;ent
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion has con&s;iderable authority in the&s;e ca&s;es,
and greater than in private property; becau&s;e of the
di&s;orders, which attend all revolutions and changes

WE &s;hall only ob&s;erve, before we conclude, that
tho' an appeal to general opinion may ju&s;tly, in the
&s;peculative &s;ciences of metaphy&s;ics, natural philo&s;ophy,
or a&s;tronomy, be e&s;teemed unfair and inconclu&s;ive,
yet in all que&s;tions with regard to morals, as well as
critici&s;m, there is really no other &s;tandard, by which
any controver&s;y can ever be decided. And nothing
is a clearer proof, that a theory of this kind is erro|neous,
than to find, that it leads to paradoxes, which
are repugnant to the common &s;entiments of mankind,
and to the practice and opinion of all nations and
all ages. The doctrine, which founds all lawful go|vernment
to an <HI>original contract,</HI> or con&s;ent of the
people, is plainly of this kind; nor has the able&s;t of
its partizans, in pro&s;ecution of it, &s;crupled to affirm,

the intere&s;ts of &s;ociety, which require mutual ab&s;ti|nence
from property, in order to pre&s;erve peace among
mankind; 'tis evident, that, when the execution of
ju&s;tice would be attended with very pe$ni$$ous con&s;e|quences,
that virtue mu&s;t be &s;u&s;pended, and give place
to public utility, in &s;uch extraordinary and &s;uch pre&s;&s;|ing

Coelum,</HI> let ju&s;tice be performed, tho' the univer&s;e be
de&s;troyed, is apparently fal&s;e, and by &s;acrificing the
end to the means, &s;hews a prepo&s;terous idea of the
<PB N="318" REF="320">
&s;ubordination of duties. What governor of a town
makes any &s;cruple of burning the &s;uburbs, when they
facilitate the advances of the enemy? Or what ge|neral
ab&s;tains from plundering a neutral country,
when the nece&s;&s;ities of war require it, and he cannot
otherwi&s;e maintain his army? The ca&s;e is the &s;ame
with the duty of allegiance; and common &s;en&s;e teaches
us, that as government obliges to obedience only on
account of its tendency to public utility, that duty
mu&s;t always, in extraordinary ca&s;es, when public ruin
would evidently attend obedience, yield $o the pri|mary
and original obligation. <HI>Salus p$puli &s;uprema
Lex,</HI> the &s;afety of the people is the &s;upreme law.
This maxim is agreeable to the &s;entiments of man|kind
in all ages: Nor is any one, when he reads of
the in&s;urrections again&s;t a NERO, or a PHILIP, &s;o in|fatuated
with party-&s;y&s;tems, as not to wi&s;h &s;ucce&s;s to
the enterprize, and prai&s;e the undertakers. Even our
high monarchical party, in &s;pite of their &s;ublime the|ory,
are forced, in &s;uch ca&s;es, to judge, and feel,
and approve, in conformity to the re&s;t of mankind.</P>
<P>RESISTANCE, therefore, being admitted in extra|ordinary
emergencies, the que&s;tion can only be, a|mong
good rea&s;oners, with regard to the degree of
nece&s;&s;ity, which can ju&s;tify re&s;i&s;tance, and render it
lawful or commendable. And here I mu&s;t confe&s;s,
that I &s;hall always incline to <HI>their</HI> &s;ide, who draw the
bond of allegiance the clo&s;e&s;t po&s;&s;ible, and con&s;ider
<PB N="319" REF="321">
an infringement of it, as the la&s;t refuge in de&s;perate
ca&s;es, when the public is in the highe&s;t danger, from
violence and tyranny. For be&s;ides the mi&s;chiefs of a
civil war, which commonly attends in&s;urrection; 'tis
certain, that where a di&s;po&s;ition to rebellion appears
among any people, it is one chief cau&s;e of tyranny
in the rulers, and forces them into many violent mea|&s;ures,
which they never would have embraced, had
every one &s;eemed inclined to &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and obedi|ence.
'Tis thus the <HI>tyrannicide</HI> or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, ap|proved
of by ancient maxims, in&s;tead of keeping ty|rants
and u&s;urpers in awe, made them ten times more
fierce and unrelenting; and is now ju&s;tly, upon that
account, aboli&s;hed by the laws of nations, and uni|ver&s;ally
condemned as a ba&s;e and treacherous method
of bringing to ju&s;tice the&s;e di&s;turbers of &s;ociety.</P>
<P>BESIDES; we mu&s;t con&s;ider, that as obedience is
our duty in the common cour&s;e of things, it ought
chiefly to be inculcated; nor can any thing be more
prepo&s;terous than an anxious care and &s;ollicitude in
&s;tating all the ca&s;es, in which re&s;i&s;tance may be al|lowed.
Thus, tho' a philo&s;opher rea&s;onably acknow|ledges,

employed in inculcating the general doctrine, than
in di&s;playing the particular exceptions, which we are,

and to extend?</P>
<P>THERE are, however, two rea&s;ons, which may be
pl$$$ed in defence of that party among us, who have,
with &s;o much indu&s;try, propagated the maxims of re|&s;i&s;tance;
maxims, which, it mu&s;t be confe&s;t, are, in
general, &s;o pernicious, and &s;o de&s;tructive of civil &s;o|ciety.
The <HI>fir&s;t</HI> is, that their antagoni&s;ts carrying
the doctrine of obedience to &s;uch an extravagant
height, as not only never to mention the exceptions
in extraordinary ca&s;es (which might, perhaps, be ex|cu&s;abie)
but even po&s;itively to exclude them; it be|came
nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e exceptions, and de|fend
the rights of injured truth and liberty. The <HI>&s;e|cond,</HI>
and, perhaps, better rea&s;on, is founded on the
nature of the BRITISH con&s;titution and form of go|vernment.</P>
<P>'TIS
almo&s;t peculiar to our con&s;titution to e&s;tabli&s;h
a fir&s;t magi&s;trate with &s;uch high pre-eminence and
dignity, that, tho' limited by the laws, he is, in a
manner, &s;o far as regards his own per&s;on, above the
laws, and can neither be que&s;tioned nor puni&s;hed for
any injury or wrong, which may be committed by
him. His mini&s;ters alone, or tho&s;e who act by his
commi&s;&s;ion, are obnoxious to ju$$ice; and while the
<PB N="321" REF="323">
prince is thus allured, by the pro&s;pect of per&s;onae
&s;afety, to give the laws their free cour&s;e, an equal &s;e|curity
is, in effect, obtained, by the puni&s;hment of
le&s;&s;er offenders, and at the &s;ame time a civil war is
avoided, which would be the infallible con&s;equence,
were an attack, at every turn, made directly upon
the &s;overeign. But tho' the con&s;titution pays this &s;a|lutary
compliment to the prince, it can never rea&s;on|ably
be under&s;tood, by that maxim, to have deter|mined
its own de&s;truction, or to have e&s;tabli&s;hed a
tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion&punc; where he protects his mini&s;ters, pe$|&s;everes
in inju&s;tice, and u&s;urps the whole power of the
commonwealth. This ca&s;e, indeed, is never expre&s;sly
put by the laws; becau&s;e it is impo&s;&s;ible for them, in
their ordinary cour&s;e, to provide a remedy for it, or e&s;ta|bli&s;h
any magi&s;trate, with &s;uperior authority, to cha&s;ti&s;e
the exorbitancies of the prince. But as a right without
a remedy would be the greate&s;t of all ab&s;urdities; the
remedy in this ca&s;e, is the extraordinary one of re&s;i&s;t|ance,
when affairs come to that extremity, that the con|&s;titution
can be defended by it alone. Re&s;i&s;tance, there|fore,
mu&s;t, of cour&s;e, become more frequent in the BRI|TISH
government, than in others, which are &s;impler,
and con&s;i&s;t of fewer parts and movements. Where the
king is an ab&s;olute &s;overeign, he has little temp$a|tion
to commit &s;uch enormous tyranny as may ju&s;tly
provoke rebellion; But where he is limited, his im|prudent
ambition, without any great vices, may run
<PB N="322" REF="324">
him into that perilous &s;ituation. This is commonly
&s;uppo&s;ed to have been the ca&s;e with CHARLES the
Fir&s;t; and if we may now &s;peak truth, after animo|&s;ities
are laid, this was al&s;o the ca&s;e with JAMES the
Second. The&s;e were harmle&s;s, if not, in their pri|vate
character, good men; but mi&s;taking the nature
of our con&s;titution, and engro&s;&s;ing the whole legi&s;la|tive
power, it became nece&s;&s;ary to oppo&s;e them with
&s;ome vehemence; and even to deprive the latter for|mally
of that authority, which he had u&s;ed with &s;uch
imprudence and indi&s;cretion.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the COALITION of PARTIES.</HEAD>
<P>TO aboli&s;h all di&s;tinctions of party may not be
practicable, perhaps not de&s;irable, in a free
government. The only parties, which are dange|rous,
are &s;uch as entertain oppo&s;ite views with regard

to the &s;everal members of the con&s;titution; where

the animo&s;ity continued for above a century between

<P>THERE is not a more effectual method of promot|ing
&s;o good an end, than to prevent all unrea&s;onable
in&s;ult and triumph of the one party over the other,
to encourage moderate opinions, to find the proper
medium in all di&s;putes, to per&s;uade each that its an|tagoni&s;t
may po&s;&s;ibly be &s;ometimes in the right, and
to keep a balance in the prai&s;e and blame which we
be&s;tow on either &s;ide. The two former E&s;&s;ays, con|cerning

calculated for this purpo&s;e with regard to the <HI>philo&s;o|phical</HI>

&s;how that neither &s;ide are in the&s;e re&s;pects &s;o fully
&s;upported by rea&s;on as they endeavour to flatter them|&s;elves.
We &s;hall proceed to exerci&s;e the &s;ame mode|ration
with regard to the <HI>hi&s;torical</HI> di&s;putes between
the parties, by proving that each of them was ju&s;tified
by plau&s;ible topics; that there were on both &s;ides
wi&s;e men who meant well to their country, and
that the pa&s;t animo&s;ity between the parties had no bet|ter
foundation than narrow prejudice or intere&s;ted
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE popular party, who afterwards acquired the
name of whigs, might ju&s;tify by very &s;pecious argu|ments,
<PB N="325" REF="331">
that oppo&s;ition to the crown, from which our
pre&s;ent free con&s;titution is derived. Tho' obliged to
acknowledge, that precedents in favour of preroga|tive
had uniformly taken place during many reigns
before CHARLES the Fir&s;t, they thought, that there
was no rea&s;on for &s;ubmitting any longer to &s;o dange|rous
an authority. Such might have been their rea|&s;oning:
The rights of mankind are &s;o &s;acred, that no
pre&s;cription of tyranny or arbitrary power can have
authority &s;ufficient to aboli&s;h them. Liberty is &s;o in|e&s;timable
a ble&s;&s;ing, that, wherever there appears any
probability of recovering it, a nation may willingly
run many hazards, and ought not even to repine at
the greate&s;t effa&s;ion of blood or trea&s;ure. All human
in&s;titutions, and none more than government, are in
continual fluctuation. Kings are &s;ure to embrace
every opportunity of extending their prerogatives:
And if favourable incidents be not al&s;o laid hold of
to extend and &s;ecure the privileges of the people,
an univer&s;al de&s;poti&s;m mu&s;t for ever prevail among&s;t
mankind. The example of all the neighbouring na|tions
prove, that it is no longer &s;afe to entru&s;t with
the crown the &s;ame exorbitant prerogatives which had
forme$ly been exerci&s;ed during rude and &s;imple ages.
And tho' the example of many late reigns may be
pleaded in favour of a power in the prince &s;omewhat
arbitrary, more remote reigns afford in&s;tances of &s;tricter
limitations impo&s;ed on the crown; and tho&s;e preten|&s;ions
of the parliament, now branded with the title
<PB N="326" REF="332">
of innovations, are only a recovery of the ju&s;t rights
of the people.</P>
<P>THESE views, far from being odious, are &s;urely
large, and generous, and noble: To their prevalence
and &s;ucce&s;s the kingdom owes its liberty; perhaps
its learning, its indu&s;try, commerce, and naval power:
By them chiefly the ENGLISH name is di&s;tingui&s;hed
among the &s;ociety of nations, and a&s;pires to a rival|&s;hip
with that of the free&s;t and mo&s;t illu&s;trious com|monwealths
of antiquity. But as all the&s;e mighty
con&s;equences could not rea&s;onably be fore&s;een at the
time when the conte&s;t began, the royali&s;ts of that age
wanted not &s;pecious arguments on their &s;ide, by which
they could ju&s;tify their defence of the then e&s;tabli&s;hed
prerogatives of the crown. We &s;hall &s;tate the que&s;|tion,
as it might appear to them at the a&s;&s;embling of
that parliament, which by their violent encroachments
on the crown, began the civil wars.</P>
<P>THE only rule of government, they might have
&s;aid, known and acknowleged among men, is u&s;e
and practice: Rea&s;on is &s;o uncertain a guide that it
will always be expo&s;ed to doubt and controver&s;y:
Could it ever render it&s;elf prevalent over the people,
men had always retained it as their &s;ole rule of con|duct:
They had &s;till continued in the primitive, un|connected
&s;tate of nature, without &s;ubmitting to po|litical
government, who&s;e &s;ole ba&s;is is, not pure rea|&s;on,
<PB N="327" REF="333">
but authority and precedent. Di&s;&s;olve the&s;e tyes,
and you break all the bonds of civil &s;ociety, and leave
every man at liberty to con&s;ult his particular intere&s;t,
by tho&s;e expedients, which his appetite, di&s;gui&s;ed
under the appearance of rea&s;on, &s;hall dictate to him.
The &s;pirit of innovation is in it&s;elf pernicious, however
favourable its particular object may &s;ometimes ap|pear:
A truth &s;o obvious, that the popular party
them&s;elves are &s;en&s;ible of it, and therefore cover their
encroachments on the crown by the plau&s;ible pre|tence
of their recovering the antient liberties of the
people.</P>
<P>BUT the pre&s;ent prerogatives of the crown, grant|ing
all the &s;uppo&s;itions of that party, have been in|conte&s;tibly
e&s;tabli&s;hed ever &s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of the
Hou&s;e of TUDOR; a period, which, as it now com|prehends
an hundred and &s;ixty years, may be allowed
&s;ufficient to give &s;tability to any con&s;titution. Would
it not have appeared ridiculous, in the reign of the
Emperor ADRIAN, to talk of the con&s;titution of the
republic as the rule of government; or to &s;uppo&s;e
that the former rights of the &s;enate, and con&s;uls and
tribunes were &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting?</P>
<P>BUT the pre&s;ent claims of the ENGLISH monarchs
are infinitely more favourable than tho&s;e of the RO|MAN
emperors during that age. The authority of
<PB N="328" REF="334">
AUGUSTUS was a plain u&s;urpation, grounded only
on military violence, and forms &s;uch an Aera in the
ROMAN hi&s;tory, as is obvious to every reader. But
if HENRY VII. really, as &s;ome pretend, enlarged
the power of the crown, it was only by in&s;en&s;ible ac|qui&s;itions,
which e&s;caped the apprehen&s;ion of the
people, and have &s;carcely been remarked even by
hi&s;torians and politicians. The new government, if
it de&s;erves the name, is an imperceptible tran&s;ition
from the former; is entirely engrafted on it; derives
its title fully from that root; and is to be con&s;idered
only as one of tho&s;e gradual revolutions, to which
human affairs, in every nation, will be for ever
&s;ubject.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of TUDOR, and after them that of
STUART, exerci&s;ed no prerogatives, but what had
been claimed and exerci&s;ed by the PLANTAGENETS.
Not a &s;ingle branch of their authority can be &s;aid to
be altogether an innovation. The only difference is,
that perhaps the former kings exerted the&s;e powers only
$word$ $ntervals, and were not able by rea&s;on of the oppo&s;i|tion
of their barons, to render them &s;o &s;teddy a rule of
admini&s;tration<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">The author believes that he was the fir&s;t writer who ad|vanced that the family of TUDOR po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in general more au|thority than their immediate predece&s;&s;ors: An opinion, which, he hopes, will be &s;upported by hi&s;tory, but which he propo&s;es with &s;ome diffidence. There are &s;trong &s;ymptoms of arbitrary power in &s;ome former reigns, even after &s;igning of the char|ters. The power of the crown in that age depended le&s;s on the con&s;titution than on the capacity and vigour of the prince who wore it.</NOTE>. But the &s;ole inference from this fact
<PB N="329" REF="335">
is, that the&s;e antient times were more turbulent and
&s;editious; and that royal authority, the con&s;titution,
and the laws have happily of late gained the a$|cendant.</P>
<P>UNDER
what pretence can the popular party now
talk of recovering the antient con&s;titution? The
former controul over the kings was not placed in the
commons, but in the barons: The people had no au|thority,
and even little or no liberty, till the crown,
by &s;uppe&s;&s;ing the&s;e factious tyrants, enforced the
execution of the laws, and obliged all the &s;ubjects
equally to re&s;pect each others rights, privileges, and
properties. If we mu&s;t return to the antient barba|rous
and GOTHIC con&s;titution; let tho&s;e gentlemen,
who now behave them&s;elves with &s;o much in&s;olence
to their &s;overeign, &s;et the fir&s;t example. Let them
make court to be admitted as retainers on a neigh|bouring
baron; and by &s;ubmitting to &s;lavery under
him acquire &s;ome protection to them&s;elves; together
with the power of exerci&s;ing rapine and oppre&s;&s;ion
over their inferior &s;laves and villains. This was the
<PB N="330" REF="336">
condition of the commons among their remote ance&s;|tors.</P>
<P>BUT how far back &s;hall we go, in having recour&s;e
to antient con&s;titutions and governments? There was
a con&s;titution &s;till more antient than that to which their
innovators affect &s;o much to appeal. During that
period there was no <HI>magna charta:</HI> The barons them|&s;elves
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed few regular, &s;tated privileges: And
the hou&s;e of commons probably had not an exi&s;t|ence.</P>
<P>IT is plea&s;ant to hear a hou&s;e, while they are u&s;urp|ing
the whole power of government, talk of reviving
antient in&s;titutions. Is it not known, that, tho' the
repre&s;entatives received wages from their con&s;tituents;
to be a member of their hou&s;e was always con&s;idered
as a burthen, and a freedom from it as a privilege?
Will they per&s;uade us, that power, which of all hu|man
acqui&s;itions is the mo&s;t coveted, and in compa|ri&s;on
of which even reputation and plea&s;ure and riches
are &s;tighted, could ever be regarded as a burthen by
any man?</P>
<P>THE property acquired of late by the commons,
it is &s;aid, entitles them to more power than their an|ce&s;tors
enjoyed. But to what is this encrea&s;e of their
property owing, but to an encrea&s;e of their liberty
and their &s;ecurity? Let them therefore acknowledge,
<PB N="331" REF="337">
that their ance&s;tors, while the crown was re&s;trained
by the &s;editious barons, really enjoyed le&s;s liberty
than they them&s;elves have attained, after the &s;overeign
acquired the a&s;cendant: And let them enjoy that li|berty
with moderation; and not forfeit it by new
exorbitant claims, and by rendering it a pretence for
endle&s;s innovations.</P>
<P>THE true rule of government is the pre&s;ent e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
practice of the age. That has mo&s;t authority,
becau&s;e it is recent: It is al&s;o better known, for the
&s;ame rea&s;on. Who has a&s;&s;ured tho&s;e tribunes, that
the PLANTAGENETS did not exerci&s;e as high acts of
authority as the TUDORS? The hi&s;torians, they &s;ay,
do not mention them. But the hi&s;torians are al&s;o
&s;ilent with regard to the chief exertions of prerogative
by the TUDORS. Where any power or prerogative is
fully and undoubtedly e&s;tabli&s;hed, the exerci&s;e of it
pa&s;&s;es for a thing of cour&s;e, and readily e&s;capes the
notice of hi&s;tory and annals. Had we no other mo|numents
of ELIZABETH's reign, than what are pre|&s;erved
even by CAMDEN, the mo&s;t copious, judicious,
and exact of our hi&s;torians, we &s;hould be entirely ig|norant
of the mo&s;t important maxims of her govern|ment.</P>
<P>WAS not the pre&s;ent monarchical government, to
its full extent, authorized by lawyers, recommended
by divines, acknowledged by politicians, acquie&s;ced
<PB N="332" REF="338">
in, nay pa&s;&s;ionately cheri&s;hed, by the people in gene|ral;
and all this during a period of at lea&s;t a hun|dred
and &s;ixty years, and till of late, without the $ea&s;t
murmur or controver&s;y? This general con&s;ent &s;urely,
during &s;o long a time, mu&s;t be &s;ufficient to render a
con&s;titution legal and valid. If the origin of all power
be derived, as is pretended, from the people; here
is their con&s;ent in the fulle&s;t and mo&s;t ample terms
that can be de$ired or imagined.</P>
<P>BUT the people mu&s;t not pretend, becau&s;e they
can, by their con&s;ent, lay the foundations of govern|ment,
that therefore they are to be permitted, at
their plea&s;ure, to overthrow and &s;ubvert them. There
is no end of the&s;e &s;editious and arrogant claims. The
power of the crown is now openly &s;truck at: The
nobility are al&s;o in vi&s;ible peril: The gentry will &s;oon
follow: The popular leaders, who will then a&s;&s;ume
the name of gentry, will next be expo&s;ed to danger:
And the people them&s;elves, become incapable of civil
government, and lying under the re&s;traint of no au|thority,
mu&s;t, for the &s;ake of peace, admit, in&s;tead
of their legal and mild monarchs, a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of mi|litary
and de&s;potic tyrants.</P>
<P>THESE con&s;equences are the more to be dreaded,
that the pre&s;ent fury of the people, tho' glo&s;&s;ed over
by preten&s;ions to civil liberty, is in reality incited by
the fanatici&s;ms of religion; a principle the mo&s;t blind,
<PB N="333" REF="339">
head&s;trong and ungovernable, by which human na|ture
can ever po&s;&s;ibly be actuated. Popular rage is
dreadful from whatever motive derived: But mu&s;t be
attended with the mo&s;t pernicious con&s;equences, when
it ari&s;es from a principle, which di&s;claims all controul
by human law, rea&s;on, or authority.</P>
<P>THESE are the arguments, which each party may
make u&s;e of to ju&s;tify the conduct of their prede|ce&s;&s;ors,
during that great cri&s;is. The event has
&s;hown, that the rea&s;onings of the popular party were
better founded; but perhaps, according to the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
maxims of lawyers and politicians, the views
of the royali&s;ts ought, beforehand, to have appeared
more &s;olid, more &s;afe, and more legal. But this is
certain, that the greater moderation we now employ
in repre&s;enting pa&s;t events; the nearer we &s;hall be to
produce a full coalition of the parties, and an entire
acquie&s;cence in our pre&s;ent happy e&s;tabli&s;hment. Mo|deration
is of advantage to every e&s;tabli&s;hment: No|thing
but zeal can overturn a &s;ettled power: And an
over-active zeal in friends is apt to beget a like &s;pirit
in antagoni&s;ts. The tran&s;ition from a moderate op|po&s;ition
again&s;t an e&s;tabli&s;hment, to an entire acquie&s;|cence
in it is ea&s;y and in&s;en&s;ible.</P>
<P>THERE are many invincible arguments, which
&s;hould induce the malecontent party to acquie&s;ce en|tirely
<PB N="334" REF="340">
in the pre&s;ent &s;ettlement of the con&s;titution.
They now find, that the &s;pirit of civil liberty, tho'
at fir&s;t conneced with religious fanatici&s;m, could purge
it&s;elf from that pollution, and appear under a more
genuine and engaging a&s;pect; a friend to toleration,
and an encourager of all the enlarged and generous &s;en|timents,
that do honour to human nature. They may
ob&s;erve, that the popular claims could &s;top at a pro|per
period; and after retrenching the exorbitant pre|rogatives
of the crown, could &s;till maintain a due re|&s;pect
to monarchy, to nobility, and to all antient in|&s;titutions.
Above all, they mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that the
very principle, which made the &s;trength of their party,
and from which it derived its chief authority, has now
de&s;erted them, and gone over to their antagoni&s;ts.
The plan of liberty is &s;ettled; its happy effects are
proved by experience; a long tract of time has given
it &s;tability; and whoever would attempt to overturn it,
and to recall the pa&s;t government or abdicated, family,
would, be&s;ides other more criminal imputations, be
expo&s;ed in their turn to the reproach of faction and
innovation. While they peru&s;e the hi&s;tory of pa&s;t
events, they ought to reflect, both that the&s;e rights
of the crown are long &s;ince annihilated, and that the
tyranny, and violence, and oppre&s;&s;ion, to which they
often gave ri&s;e, are ills, from which the e&s;tabli&s;hed
liberty of the con&s;titution has now at la&s;t happily pro|tected
<PB N="335" REF="341">
the people. The&s;e reflections will prove a bet|ter
&s;ecurity to our freedom and privileges, than to
deny, contrary to the cleare&s;t evidence of facts, that
&s;uch regal powers ever had any exi&s;tence. There
is not a more effectual method of betraying a cau&s;e,
than to lay the &s;tre&s;s of the argument on a wrong
place, and by di&s;puting an untenable po&s;t, enure the
adver&s;aries to &s;ucce&s;s and victory.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the PROTESTANT SUCCESSION.</HEAD>
<P>I SUPPOSE, that a member of parliament, in
the reign of King WILLIAM or Queen ANNE,
while the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> was
yet uncertain, were deliberating concerning the party
he would choo&s;e in that important que&s;tion, and
weighing, with impartiality, the advantages and di&s;|advantages
on each &s;ide. I believe the following
particulars would have entered into his con&s;ide|ration.</P>
<P>HE would ea&s;ily perceive the great advantages re|&s;ulting
from the re&s;toration of the STUART family;
by which we &s;hould pre&s;erve the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion clear
and undi&s;puted, free from a pretender, with &s;uch a
&s;pecious title as that of blood, which, with the mul|titude,
is always the claim, the &s;tronge&s;t and mo&s;t
ea&s;ily comprehended. 'Tis in vain to &s;ay, as many
have done, that the que&s;tion with regard to <HI>governors,</HI>
<PB N="338" REF="343">
independent of <HI>government,</HI> is frivolous, and little
worth di&s;puting, much le&s;s fighting about. The ge|nerality
of mankind never will enter into the&s;e &s;enti|ments;
and 'tis much happier, I believe, for &s;ociety,
that they do not, but rather continue in their natural
prejudices and prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. How could &s;tability be
pre&s;erved in any monarchical government, (which,
tho' perhaps, not the be&s;t, is, and always has been,
the mo&s;t common of any) unle&s;s men had &s;o pa&s;&s;ionate
a regard for the true heir of their royal family; and
even tho' weak in under&s;tanding, or infirm in years,
gave him &s;o great a preference above per&s;ons the mo&s;t
accompli&s;hed in &s;hining talents, or celebrated for
great atchievements? Would not every popular leader
put in his claim at every vacancy, or even without any
vacancy; and the kingdom become the theatre of
perpetual wars and convul&s;ions? The condition of
the ROMAN empire, &s;urely, was not, in this re&s;pect,
much to be envied; nor is that of the <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> na|tions,
who pay little regard to the title of their &s;ove|reigns,
but &s;acrifice them, every day, to the caprice
or momentary humour of the populace or &s;oldiery.
'Tis but a fooli&s;h wi&s;dom, which is &s;o carefully di&s;|played,
in undervaluing princes, and placing them on
a level with the meane&s;t of mankind. To be &s;ure,
an anatomi&s;t finds no more in the greate&s;t monarch
than in the lowe&s;t pea&s;ant or day labourer; and a
morali&s;t may, perhaps, frequently find le&s;s. But
<PB N="339" REF="344">
what do all the&s;e reflections tend to? We, all of
us, &s;till retain the&s;e prejudices in favour of birth and
family; and neither in our &s;erious occupations, nor
mo&s;t carele&s;s amu&s;ements, can we ever get entirely
rid of them. A tragedy, that &s;hould repre&s;ent the
adventures of &s;ailors, or porters, or even of private
gentlemen, would pre&s;ently di&s;gu&s;t us; but one that
introduces kings and princes, acquires in our eyes an air
of importance and dignity. Or &s;hould a man be able,
by his &s;uperior wi&s;dom, to get entirely above &s;uch
prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, he would &s;oon, by means of the &s;ame
wi&s;dom, again bring him&s;elf down to them, for the
&s;ake of &s;ociety, who&s;e welfare he would perceive to
be intimately connected with them. Far from endea|vouring
to undeceive the people in this particular, he
would cheri&s;h &s;uch &s;entiments of reverence to their
princes; as requi&s;ite to pre&s;erve a due &s;ubordination
in &s;ociety. And tho' the lives of twenty thou&s;and
men be often &s;acrificed to maintain a king in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of his throne, or pre&s;erve the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
undi&s;turbed, he entertains no indignation at the lo&s;s,
on pretence that every individual of the&s;e was, per|haps,
in him&s;elf, as valuable as the prince he &s;erved.
He con&s;iders the con&s;equences of violating the here|ditary
rights of kings: Con&s;equences, which may be
felt for many centuries; while the lo&s;s of &s;everal
thou&s;and men brings &s;o little prejudice to a large
kingdom, that it may not be perceived a few years
afterwards.</P>
<P><PB N="340" REF="345">
THE advantages of the HANOVER &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are
of an oppo&s;ite nature, and ari&s;e from this very cir|cum&s;tance,
that it violates hereditary right; and
places on the throne a prince, to whom birth gave
no title to that dignity. 'Tis evident to any one who
con&s;iders the hi&s;tory of this i&s;land, that the privileges
of the people have, during the two la&s;t centuries,
been continually upon the increa&s;e, by the divi&s;ion of
the church-lands, by the alienations of the barons
e&s;tates, by the progre&s;s of trade, and above all, by
the happine&s;s of our &s;ituation, which, for a long
time, gave us &s;ufficient &s;ecurity, without any &s;tanding
army or military e&s;tabli&s;hment. On the contrary,
public liberty has, almo&s;t in every other nation of
EUROPE, been, during the &s;ame period, extremely
upon the decline; while the people were di&s;gu&s;ted at
the hard&s;hips of the old GOTHIC militia, and cho&s;e
rather to intru&s;t their prince with mercenary armies,
which he ea&s;ily turned again&s;t them&s;elves. It was no|thing
extraordinary, therefore, that &s;ome of our BRI|TISH
&s;overeigns mi&s;took the nature of the con&s;titu|tion,
and genius of the people; and as they embraced
all the favourable precedents left them by their ance&s;|tors,
they overlooked all tho&s;e which were contrary,
and which &s;uppo&s;ed a limitation in our government.
They were encouraged in this mi&s;take, by the ex|ample
of all the neighbouring princes, who, bearing
the &s;ame title or appellation, and being adorned with
the &s;ame en&s;igns of authority, naturally led them to
<PB N="341" REF="346">
claim the &s;ame powers and prerogatives<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><P>It appears from the &s;peeches, and proclamations, and whole train of King JAMES I.'s actions, as well as his &s;on's, that they con&s;idered the ENGLISH government as a &s;imple monarchy, and never imagined that any con&s;iderable part of their &s;ubjects enter|tained a contrary idea. This made them di&s;cover their preten|&s;ions, without preparing any force to &s;upport them; and even without re&s;erve or di&s;gui&s;e, which are always employed by tho&s;e, who enter upon any new project, or endeavour to innovate in any government. King JAMES told his parliament plainly, when they meddled$ in &s;tate affairs, <HI>Ne &s;utor ultra crepidam.</HI> He u&s;ed al&s;o, at his table, in promi&s;cuous companies, to advance his notions, in a manner &s;till more undi&s;gui&s;ed: As we may learn from a &s;tory told in the life of Mr. WALLER, and which that poet u&s;ed frequently to repeat. When Mr. WALLER was young, he had the curio&s;ity to go to court; and he &s;tood in the circle, and &s;aw King JAMES dine, where, among&s;t other company, there &s;at at table two bi&s;hops. The King, openly and aloud, pro|po&s;ed this que&s;tion, <HI>Whether he might not take bis &s;ubjects money, when he had occa&s;ion for it, without all this formality of parliament?</HI> The one bi&s;hop readily replied, <HI>God forbid you &s;hould not: For you are the breath of our no&s;tri$s.</HI> The other bi&s;hop declined an&s;wer|ing, and &s;aid he was not &s;killed in parliamentary ca&s;es: But up|on the King's urging him, and &s;aying he would admit of no eva&s;ion, his lord&s;hip replied very plea&s;antly, <HI>Why, then, I think your maje&s;ty may lawfully take my brother's money: For he offers it.</HI> In Sir WALTER RALEIGH'S preface to the Hi&s;tory of the World, there is this remarkable pa&s;&s;age. PHILIP II. <HI>by &s;trong hand and main force, attempted to make him&s;elf not only an</HI> ab&s;olute monarch <HI>over the</HI> Netherlands, <HI>like unto the kings and &s;overeigns of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> France; <HI>but</HI> Turk-like, <HI>to tread under his feet all their natural and fundamental laws, privileges, and antient rights.</HI> SPENSER, &s;peaking of &s;ome grants of the ENGLISH kings to the IRISH corporations, &s;ays, &startq;All which, tho', at the time of their fir&s;t grant, they were tolerable, and perhaps rea&s;on|able, yet now are mo&s;t unrea&s;onable and inconvenient. But all the&s;e will ea&s;ily be cut off with the &s;uperior power of her Maje&s;ty's prerogative, again&s;t which her own grants are not to be pleaded or inforced.&endq; <HI>State of</HI> IRELAND, p. 1537. Edit. 1706.</P>
<P>As the&s;e were very common, if not, perhaps, the univer&s;al notions of the times, the two fir&s;t princes of the hou&s;e of STUART were the more excu&s;able for their mi&s;take. And R$|$IN, &s;uitable to his u&s;ual malignity and partiality, &s;eems to treat them with too much &s;everity, upon account of it.</P></NOTE>. The flat|tery
of courtiers farther blinded them; and above all,
<PB N="342" REF="347">
that of the clergy, who from &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>&s;crip|ture,</HI>
and the&s;e wre&s;ted too, had erected a regular and
avowed &s;y&s;tem of tyranny and de&s;potic power. The
only method of de&s;troying, at once, all the&s;e exorbi|tant
claims and preten&s;ions, was to depart from the
true hereditary line, and choo&s;e a prince, who, being
plainly a creature of the public, and receiving the
crown on conditions, expre&s;&s;ed and avowed, found
his authority e&s;tabli&s;hed on the &s;ame bottom with the
privileges of the people. By electing him in the royal
line, we cut off all hopes of ambitious &s;ubjects, who
<PB N="343" REF="348">
might, in future emergencies, di&s;turb the government
by their cabals and preten&s;ions: By rendering the
crown hereditary in his family, we avoided all the in|conveniencies
of elective monarchy: And by exclu|ding
the lineal heir, we &s;ecured all our con&s;titutional
limitations, and rendered our government uniform
and of a piece. The people cheri&s;h monarchy, be|cau&s;e
protected by it: The monarch favours liberty.
becau&s;e created by it. And thus every advantage is
obtained by the new e&s;tabli&s;hment, as far as human
&s;kill and wi&s;dom can extend it&s;elf.</P>
<P>THESE are the &s;eparate advantages of fixing the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, either in the hou&s;e of STUART, or in that
of HANOVER. There are al&s;o di&s;advantages in each
e&s;tabli&s;hment, which an impartial partriot would pon|der
and examine, in order to form a ju&s;t judgment up|on
the whole.</P>
<P>THE di&s;advantages of the Prote&s;tant &s;ucce&s;&s;ion con|fi&s;t
in the foreign dominions, which are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by
the princes of the HANOVER line, and which, it
might be &s;uppo&s;ed, would engage us in the intrigues
and wars of the continent, and lo&s;e us, in &s;ome mea|&s;ure,
the ine&s;timable advantage we po&s;&s;e&s;s of being
&s;urrounded and guarded by the &s;ea, which we com|mand.
The di&s;advantages of recalling the abdicated
family con&s;i&s;t chiefly in their religion, which is more
prejudicial to &s;ociety than that e&s;tabli&s;hed among&s;t us,
<PB N="344" REF="349">
is contrary to it, and affords no toleration, or peace,
or &s;$urity to any other religion.</P>
<P>IT appears to me, that all the&s;e advantages and
di&s;advantages are allowed on both &s;ides; at lea&s;t, by
every one, who is at all &s;u&s;ceptible of argument or
rea&s;oning. No &s;ubject, however loyal, pretends to
deny, that the di&s;puted title and foreign dominions
of the pre&s;ent royal family are a lo&s;s. Nor is there
any parti$$n of the STUART family, but will confe&s;s,
that the c$aim of hereditary, indefea&s;ible right, and
the Roman Catholic religion, are al&s;o di&s;advantages
in that family. It belongs, therefore, to a philo|&s;opher
alone, who is of neither party, to put all the&s;e
circum&s;tances in the &s;cale, and a&s;&s;ign to each of them
its proper poi&s;e and influence. Such an one will rea|dily,
at fir&s;t, acknowledge, that all political que&s;tions
are infinitely complicated, and that there &s;carce ever
occurs in any deliberation, a choice, which is either
purely good, or purely ill. Con&s;equences, mixed
and varied, may be fore&s;een to flow from every mea|&s;ure:
And many con&s;equences, unfore&s;een, do always'
in fact, re&s;ult from it. He&s;itation, and re&s;erve, and
&s;u&s;pen&s;e, are, therefore, the only &s;entiments he brings
to this e&s;&s;ay or trial. Or if he indulges any pa&s;&s;ion,
$$is that of deri&s;ion and ridicule again&s;t the ignorant
multitude, who are always clamorous and dogmatical,
even in the nice&s;t que&s;tions, of which, from want or
<PB N="345" REF="350">
temper, perhaps &s;till more than of under&s;tanding,
they are altogether unfit judges.</P>
<P>BUT to &s;ay &s;omething more determinate on this
head, the following reflections will, I hope, &s;how the
temper, if not the under&s;tanding, of a philo&s;opher.</P>
<P>WERE we to judge merely by fir&s;t appearance, and
by pa&s;t experience, we mu&s;t allow that the advantages
of a parliamentary title in the hou&s;e of HANOVER are
much greater than tho&s;e of an undi&s;puted hereditary
title in the hou&s;e of STUART; and that our fathers
acted wi&s;ely in preferring the former to the latter. So
long as the hou&s;e of STUART reigned in BRITAIN,
which, with &s;ome interruption, was above 80 years,
the government was kept in a continual fever, by the
contentions between the privileges of the people and
the prerogatives of the crown. If arms were dropt,
the noi&s;e of di&s;putes continued: Or if the&s;e were &s;i|lenced,
jealou&s;y &s;till corroded the heart, and threw
the nation into an unnatural ferment and di&s;order.
And while we were thus occupied in dome&s;tic con|tentions,
a foreign power, dangerous, if not fatal, to
public liberty, erected it&s;elf in EUROPE, without any
oppo&s;ition from us, and even &s;ometimes with our a&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>BUT during the&s;e la&s;t &s;ixty years, when a parlia|mentary
e&s;tabli&s;hment has taken place; whatever
<PB N="346" REF="351">
$actions may have prevailed either among the people
or in public a&s;&s;emblies, the whole force of our con&s;ti|tution
has always fallen to one &s;ide, and an uninter|rupted
harmony has been pre&s;erved between our
pri$$es and our parliaments. Public liberty, with in|ternal
peace and order, has flouri&s;hed almo&s;t without
interruption: Trade, and manufactures, and agri|culture,
have increa&s;ed: The arts, and &s;ciences, and
philo&s;ophy, have been cultivated. Even religious par|ties
have been nece&s;&s;itated to lay a&s;ide their mutual
rancour: And the glory of the nation has &s;pread it&s;elf
all over EUROPE; while we &s;tand the bulwark a|gainst
oppre&s;&s;ion, and the great antagoni&s;t of that
power which threatens every people with conque&s;t
and &s;ubjection. So long and &s;o glorious a period no
nation almo&s;t can boa&s;t of: Nor is there another in|&s;tance
in the whole hi&s;tory of mankind, that &s;o many
millions of people have, during &s;uch a &s;pace of time,
been held together, in a manner &s;o free, &s;o rational,
and &s;o &s;uitable to the dignity of human nature.</P>
<P>BUT tho' this recent in&s;tance &s;eems clearly to de|cide
in favour of the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment, there are
&s;ome circum&s;tances to be thrown into the other &s;cale;
and 'tis dangerous to regulate our judgment by one
event or example.</P>
<P>WE have had two rebellions during the flouri&s;hing
period above mentioned, be&s;ides plots and con&s;pira|cies
<PB N="347" REF="352">
without number. And if none of the&s;e have pro|duced
any very fatal event, we may a&s;cribe our e&s;cape
chiefly to the narrow genius of tho&s;e princes who di&s;|puted
our e&s;tabli&s;hment; and may e&s;teem our&s;elves &s;o
far fortunate. But the claims of the bani&s;hed family,
I fear, are not yet antiquated; and who can foretel,
that their future attempts will produce no greater di&s;|order?</P>
<P>THE di&s;putes betwixt privilege and prerogative
may ea&s;ily be compo&s;ed by laws, and votes, and con|ferences,
and conce&s;&s;ions; where there is tolerable
temper or prudence on both &s;ides, or on either &s;ide.
Among contending titles, the que&s;tion can only be de|termined
by the &s;word, and by deva&s;tation, and by
civil war.</P>
<P>A PRINCE who fills the throne with a di&s;puted title,
dares not arm his &s;ubjects; the only method of &s;ecu|ring
a people fully, both again&s;t dome&s;tic oppre&s;&s;ion
and foreign conque&s;t.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all our riches and renown,
what a critical e&s;cape did we lately make from dan|gers,
which were owing not &s;o much to bad conduct
and ill &s;ucce&s;s in war, as to the pernicious practice of
mortgaging our finances, and the &s;till more pernicious
maxim of never paying off our incumbrances? Such
<PB N="348" REF="353">
fatal mea&s;ures could never have been embraced, had
it not been to &s;ecure a precarious e&s;tabli&s;hment<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Tho&s;e who con&s;ider how univer&s;al this pernicious practice of funding has become all over EUROPE, may perhaps di&s;pute this la&s;t opinion. But we lay under le&s;s nece&s;&s;ity than other &s;tates.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT to convince us, that an hereditary title is to be
embraced rather than a parliamentary one, which is
not &s;upported by any other views or motives; a man
needs only tran&s;port him&s;elf back to the aera of the re|&s;toration,
and &s;uppo&s;e, that he had had a &s;eat in that
parliament which recalled the royal family, and put a
period to the greate&s;t di&s;orders that ever aro&s;e from
the oppo&s;ite preten&s;ions of prince and people. What
would have been thought of one, that had propo&s;ed,
at that time, to &s;et a&s;ide CHARLES II. and &s;ettle the
crown on the Duke of YORK or GLOCESTER, mere|ly
in order to exclude all high claims, like tho&s;e of
their father and grandfather? Would not &s;uch an one
have been regarded as a very extravagant projector,
who loved dangerous remedies, and could tamper and
play with a government and national con&s;titution, like
a quack with a &s;ickly patien$?</P>
<P>THE advantages which re&s;ult from a parliamentary
title, preferably to an hereditary one, tho' they are great,
are too refined ever to enter into the conception of
<PB N="349" REF="354">
the vulgar. The bulk of mankind would never al|low
them to be &s;ufficient for committing what would
be regarded as an inju&s;tice to the prince. They mu&s;t
be &s;upported by &s;ome gro&s;s, popular, and familiar to|pics;
and wi&s;e men, tho' convinced of their force,
would reject them, in compliance with the weakne&s;s
and prejudices of the people. An incroaching tyrant
or deluded bigot alone, by his mi&s;conduct, is able to
enrage the nation, and render practicable what was
always, perhaps, de&s;ireable.</P>
<P>IN reality, the rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned by the nation for ex|cluding
the race of STUART, and &s;o many other
branches of the royal family, is not on account of their
hereditary title (which, however ju&s;t in it&s;elf, would,
to vulgar apprehen&s;ions, have appeared altogether ab|&s;urd)
but on account of their religion. Which leads
us to compare the di&s;advantages above mentioned of
each e&s;tabli&s;hment.</P>
<P>I CONFESS, that, con&s;idering the matter in gene|ral,
it were rather to be wi&s;hed, that our prince had
no foreign dominions, and could confine all his atten|tion
to the government of this i&s;land. For, not to
mention &s;ome real inconveniencies that may re&s;ult
from territories on the continent, they afford &s;uch a
handle for calumny and defamation, as is greedily
&s;eized by the people, who are always di&s;po&s;ed to
think ill of their &s;uperiors. It mu&s;t, however, be ac|knowledged,
<PB N="350" REF="355">
that HANOVER is, perhaps, the &s;pot of
ground in EUROPE the lea&s;t inconvenient for a King
of BRITAIN. It lies in the heart of GERMANY, at a
di&s;tance from the great powers, which are our natural
rivals: It is protected by the laws of the empire, as
well as by the arms of its own &s;overeign, and it &s;erves
only to connect us more clo&s;ely with the hou&s;e of
AUSTRIA, which is our natural ally.</P>
<P>IN the la&s;t war, it has been of &s;ervice to us, by fur|ni&s;hing
us with a con&s;iderable body of auxiliary troops,
the brave&s;t and mo&s;t faithful in the world. The
Elector of HANOVER is the only con&s;iderable prince in
the empire, who has pur&s;ued no &s;eparate end, and
has rai&s;ed up no &s;tale preten&s;ions, during the late
commotions of EUROPE; but has acted, all along,
with the dignity of a king of BRITAIN. And ever
&s;ince the acce&s;&s;ion of that family, it would be difficult
to &s;how any harm we have ever received from the
electoral dominions, except that &s;hort di&s;gu&s;t in 1718,
with CHARLES XII. who, regulating him&s;elf by
maxims very different from tho&s;e of other princes,
made a per&s;onal quarrel of every public injury.</P>
<P>THE religious per&s;ua&s;ion of the hou&s;e of STUART
is an inconvenience of a much deeper dye, and would
threaten us with much more di&s;mal con&s;equences.
The Roman Catholic religion, with its huge train of
prie&s;ts and friers, is va&s;tly more expen&s;ive than ours:
<PB N="351" REF="356">
Even tho' unaccompanied with its natural attendants
of inqui&s;itors, and &s;takes, and gibbets, it is le&s;s tole|rating:
And not contented with dividing the &s;acer|dotal
from the regal office (which mu&s;t be prejudicial
to any &s;tate) it be&s;tows the former on a foreigner,
who has always a &s;eparate, and may often have an
oppo&s;ite intere&s;t to that of the public.</P>
<P>BUT were this religion ever &s;o advantageous to
&s;ociety, it is contrary to that which is e&s;tabli&s;hed
among us, and which is likely to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, for a
long time, of the minds of the people. And tho' it
is much to be hoped, that the progre&s;s of rea&s;on and
philo&s;ophy will, by degrees, abate the virulent a$ri|mony
of oppo&s;ite religions all over EUROPE; yet the
&s;pirit of moderation has, as yet, made too &s;low ad|vances
to be intirely tru&s;ted, The conduct of the
SAXON family, where the &s;ame per&s;on can be a Ca|tholic
King and a Prote&s;tant Elector, is, perhaps, the
fir&s;t in&s;tance, in modern times, of &s;o rea&s;onable and
prudent a behaviour. And the gradual progre&s;s of
the Catholic &s;uper&s;tition does, even there, progno&s;|ticate
a &s;peedy alteration: After which, 'tis ju&s;tly to
be apprehended, that per&s;ecutions will put a &s;peedy
period to the Prote&s;tant religion in the place of its
nativity.</P>
<P>THUS, upon the whole, the advantages of the
&s;ettlement in the family of STUART, which free us

from a di&s;puted title, &s;eem to bear &s;ome proportion
with tho&s;e of the &s;ettlement in the family of HANO|VER,
which frees us from the claims of prerogative:
But at the &s;ame time, its di&s;advantages, by placing on
the throne a Roman Catholic, are much greater than
tho&s;e of the other e&s;tabli&s;hment, in &s;ettling the crown
on a foreign prince. What party an impartial patri|ot,
in the reign of K. WILLIAM or Q. ANNE, would
have cho&s;en amid&s;t the&s;e oppo&s;ite views, may, perhaps,
to &s;ome appear hard to determine. For my part, I
e&s;teem liberty &s;o invaluable a ble&s;&s;ing in &s;ociety, that
whatever favours its progre&s;s and &s;ecurity, can &s;carce
be too fondly cheri&s;hed by every one who is a lover of
human kind.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;ettlement in the hou&s;e of HANOVER
has actually taken place. The princes of that family,
without intrigue, without cabal, without &s;olicitation
on their part, have been called to mount our throne,
by the united voice of the whole legi&s;lative body.
They have, &s;ince their acce&s;&s;ion, di&s;played, in all
their actions, the utmo&s;t mildne&s;s, equity, and regard
to the laws and con&s;titution. Our own mini&s;ters, our
own parliaments, our&s;elves have governed us; and if
aught ill has befallen us, we can only blame fortune
or our&s;elves. What a reproach mu&s;t we become
among nations, if, di&s;gu&s;ted with a &s;ettlement &s;o deli|berately
made, and who&s;e conditions have been &s;o re|ligiou&s;ly
ob&s;erved, we &s;hould throw every thing again
<PB N="353" REF="358">
into confu&s;ion; and by our levity and rebellious di&s;|po&s;ition,
prove our&s;elves totally unfit for any &s;tate but
that of ab&s;olute &s;lavery and &s;ubjection?</P>
<P>THE greate&s;t inconvenience attending a di&s;puted
title, is, that it brings us in danger of civil wars and
rebellions. What wi&s;e man, to avoid this incon|venience,
would run directly upon a civil war and re|bellion?
Not to mention, that &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
&s;ecured by &s;o many laws, mu&s;t, ere this time, in the
apprehen&s;ion of a great part of the nation, have begot
a title in the hou&s;e of HANOVER, independent of
their pre&s;ent po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion: So that now we &s;hould not,
even by a revolution, obtain the end of avoiding a
di&s;puted title.</P>
<P>NO revolution made by national forces, will ever be
able, without &s;ome other great nece&s;&s;ity, to aboli&s;h
our debts and incumbrances, in which the intere&s;t of
&s;o many per&s;ons is concerned. And a revolution
made by foreign forces, is a conque&s;t: A calamity
with which the precarious balance of power very
nearly threatens us, and which our civil di&s;&s;en&s;ions
are likely, above all other circum&s;tances, to bring
&s;uddenly upon us.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">IDEA OF A PERFECT COMMONWEALTH.</HEAD>
<P>OF all mankind, there are none &s;o pernicious as
political projectors, if they have power; nor &s;o
ridiculous, if they want it: As on the other hand, a
wi&s;e politician is the mo&s;t beneficial character in na|ture,
if accompanied with authority; and the mo&s;t
innocent, and not altogether u&s;ele&s;s, even if deprived
of it. 'Tis not with forms of government, as with
other artificial contrivances; where an old engine
may be rejected, if we can di&s;cover another more ac|curate
and commodious, or where trials may &s;afely
be made, even tho' the &s;ucce&s;s be doubtful. An
e&s;tabli&s;hed government has an infinite advantage, by
that very circum&s;tance of its being e&s;tabli&s;hed; the
bulk of mankind being governed by authority, not
rea&s;on, and never attributing authority to any thing
that has not the recommendation of antiquity. To
tamper, therefore, in this affair, or try projects merely
upon the credit of &s;uppo&s;ed argument and philo&s;ophy,
<PB N="356" REF="360">
can never be the part of a wi&s;e magi&s;trate, who will
bear a reverence to what carries the marks of age;
and tho' he may attempt &s;ome improvement for the
public good, yet will he adju&s;t his innovations, as
much as po&s;&s;ible, to the antient fabric, and pre&s;erve
intire the chief pillars and &s;upports of the con&s;ti|tution.</P>
<P>THE mathematicians in EUROPE have been much
divided concerning that figure of a &s;hip, which is the
mo&s;t commodious for &s;ailing; and HUYGENS, who
at la&s;t determined this controver&s;y, is ju&s;tly thought
to have obliged the learned, as well as commercial
world; tho' COLUMBUS had &s;ailed to AMERICA,
and Sir FRANCIS DRAKE made the tour of the world,
without any &s;uch di&s;covery. As one form of govern|ment
mu&s;t be allowed more perfect than another, in|dependent
of the manners and humours of particular
men; why may we not inquire what is the mo&s;t per|fect
of all, tho' the common botched and inaccurate
governments &s;eem to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of &s;ociety,
and tho' it be not &s;o ea&s;y to e&s;tabli&s;h a new govern|ment,
as to build a ve&s;&s;el upon a new plan? The
&s;ubject is &s;urely the mo&s;t worthy curio&s;ity of any the
wit of man can po&s;&s;ibly devi&s;e. And who knows, if
this controver&s;y were fixed by the univer&s;al con&s;ent of
the learned, but, in &s;ome future age, an opportunity
might be afforded of reducing the theory to practice,
either by a di&s;&s;olution of the old governments, or the
<PB N="357" REF="361">
combination of men to form a new one, in &s;ome di&s;|tant
part of the world? In all ca&s;es, it mu&s;t be ad|vantageous
to know what is mo&s;t perfect in the
kind, that we may be able to bring any real con&s;titu|tion
or form of government as near it as po&s;&s;ible, by
&s;uch gentle alterations and innovations as may not
give too great di&s;turbance to &s;ociety.</P>
<P>ALL I pretend to in the pre&s;ent e&s;&s;ay is to revive
this &s;ubject of &s;peculation; and therefore I &s;hall deli|ver
my &s;entiments in as few words as po&s;&s;ible. A
long di&s;&s;ertation on that head would not, I appre|hend,
be very acceptable to the public, who will be
apt to regard &s;uch di&s;qui&s;itions both as u&s;ele&s;s and chi|merical.</P>
<P>ALL plans of government, which &s;uppo&s;e great re|formation
in the manners of mankind, are plainly ima|ginary.
Of this nature, are the <HI>Republic</HI> of PLATO,
and the <HI>Utopia</HI> of Sir THOMAS MORE. The OCEANA
is the only valuable model of a commonwealth, that
has as yet been offered to the public.</P>
<P>THE chief defects of the OCEANA &s;eem to be the&s;e.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> Its rotation is inconvenient, by throwing men,
of whatever ability, by intervals, out of public em|ployments.
<HI>Secondly,</HI> Its <HI>Agrarian</HI> is impracticable.
Men will &s;oon learn the art, which was practi&s;ed in
antient ROME, of concealing their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions under
<PB N="358" REF="362">
other people's names; till at la&s;t, the abu&s;e will be|come
&s;o common, that they will throw off even the
appearance of re&s;traint. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The OCEANA pro|vides
not a &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for liberty, or the redre&s;s
of grievances. The &s;enate mu&s;t propo&s;e, and the
people con&s;ent; by which means, the &s;enate have not
only a negative upon the people, but, what is of infi|nitely
greater con&s;equence, their negative goes before
the votes of the people. Were the King's negative
of the &s;ame nature in the ENGLISH con&s;titution, and
could he prevent any bill from coming into parlia|ment,
he would be an ab&s;olute monarch. As his ne|gative
follows the votes of the hou&s;es, it is of little
con&s;equence: Such a difference is there in the man|ner
of placing the &s;ame thing. When a popular bill
has been debated in the two hou&s;es, is brought to
maturity, all its conveniencies and inconveniencies
weighed and balanced; if afterwards it be pre&s;ented
for the royal a&s;&s;ent, few princes will venture to reject
the unanimous de&s;ire of the people. But could the
King cru&s;h a di&s;agreeable bill in embryo (as was the
ca&s;e for &s;ome time, in the SCOTCH parliament, by
means of the lords of the articles) the BRITISH go|vernment
would have no balance, nor would grie|vances
ever be redre&s;&s;ed: And 'tis certain, that exor|bitant
power proceeds not, in any government, from
new laws, &s;o much as from neglecting to remedy the
abu&s;es which frequently ri&s;e from the old ones. A
government, &s;ays MACHIAVEL, mu&s;t often be brought
<PB N="359" REF="363">
back to its original principles. It appears then, that
in the OCEANA the whole legi&s;lature may be &s;aid to
re&s;t in the &s;enate; which HARRINGTON would own
to be an inconvenient form of government, e&s;pecially
after the <HI>Agrarian</HI> is aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>HERE is a form of government, to which I cannot,
in theory, di&s;cover any con&s;iderable objection.</P>
<P>LET GREAT BRITAIN and IRELAND, or any ter|ritory
of equal extent, be divided into 100 counties,
and each county into 100 pari&s;hes, making in all
10,000. If the country purpo&s;ed to be erected into a
commonwealth, be of more narrow extent, we may
dimini&s;h the number of counties; but never bring
them below thirty. If it be of greater extent, 'twere
better to enlarge the pari&s;hes, or throw more pari&s;hes
into a county, than increa&s;e the number of counties.</P>
<P>LET all the free-holders of ten pounds a-year in
the country, and all the hou&s;e-holders worth 200
pounds in the town-pari&s;hes, meet annually in the
pari&s;h-church, and chu&s;e, by ballot, &s;ome freeholder of
the county for their member, whom we &s;hall call the
county <HI>repre&s;entative.</HI></P>
<P>LET the 100 county repre&s;entatives, two days after
their election, meet in the county-town, and chu&s;e by
ballot, from their own body, ten county <HI>magi&s;trates,</HI>
<PB N="360" REF="364">
and one <HI>&s;enator.</HI> There are, therefore, in the whole
commonwealth, 100 &s;enators, 1100 county magi&s;|trates,
and 10,000 county repre&s;entatives. For we
&s;hall be&s;tow on all &s;enators the authority of county
magi&s;trates, and on all county magi&s;trates the autho|rity
of county repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>LET the &s;enators meet in the capital, and be en|dowed
with the whole executive power of the com|monwealth;
the power of peace and war, of giving
orders to generals, admirals, and amba&s;&s;adors, and, in
&s;hort, all the prerogatives of a BRITISH King, ex|cept
his negative.</P>
<P>LET the county repre&s;entatives meet in their parti|cular

whole county repre&s;entatives for every trivial law,
that may be requi&s;ite, the &s;enate have their choice of

&s;ending down the law either to the county magi&s;trates

<P>THE magi&s;trates, tho' the law be referred to them,

eight days before the day appointed for
the a&s;&s;embling, in order to deliberate concerning it.
And tho' the determination be, by the &s;enate, refer|red

county order the magi&s;trates to a&s;&s;emble the whole

<P>EITHER the county magi&s;trates or repre&s;entatives

a law to be propo&s;ed to the &s;enate; and if five coun|ties
concur in the &s;ame order, the law, tho' refu&s;ed
by the &s;enate, mu&s;t come either to the county magi|&s;trates
or repre&s;entatives, as is contained in the order
of the five counties.</P>
<P>ANY twenty counties, by a vote either of their ma|gi&s;trates
or repre&s;entatives, may throw any man out
<PB N="362" REF="366">
of all public offices for a year. Thirty counties for
three years.</P>
<P>THE &s;enate has a power of throwing out any mem|ber
or number of members of its own body, not to
be re-elected for that year. The &s;enate cannot throw
out twice in a year the &s;enator of the &s;ame county.</P>
<P>THE power of the old &s;enate continues for three
weeks after the annual election of the county repre|&s;entatives.
Then all the new &s;enators are &s;hut up in
a conclave, like the cardinals; and by an intricate
ballot, &s;uch as that of VENICE or MALTA, they
chu&s;e the following magi&s;trates; a protector, who re|pre&s;ents
the dignity of the commonwealth, and pre|&s;ides
in the &s;enate; two &s;ecretaries of &s;tate; the&s;e &s;ix
councils, a council of &s;tate, a council of religion and
learning, a council of trade, a council of laws, a
council of war, a council of the admiralty, each
council con&s;i&s;ting of five per&s;ons; together with &s;ix
commi&s;&s;ioners of the trea&s;ury and a fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner.
All the&s;e mu&s;t be &s;enators. The &s;enate al&s;o names
all the amba&s;&s;adors to foreign courts, who may either
be &s;enators or not.</P>
<P>THE &s;enate may continue any or all of the&s;e, but
mu&s;t re-elect them every year.</P>
<P><PB N="363" REF="367">
THE protector and two &s;ecretaries have &s;e&s;&s;ion and
&s;uffrage in the council of &s;tate. The bu&s;ine&s;s of that
council is all foreign politics. The council of &s;tate
has &s;e&s;&s;ion and &s;uffrage in all the other councils.</P>
<P>THE council of religion and learning in&s;pects the
univer&s;ities and clergy. That of trade in&s;pects every
thing that may affect commerce. That of laws in|&s;pects
all the abu&s;es of laws by the inferior magi|&s;trates,
and examines what improvements may be
made of the municipal law. That of war in&s;pects
the militia and its di&s;cipline, magazines, &s;tores, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
and when the republic is in war, examines into the
proper orders for generals. The council of admi|ralty
has the &s;ame power with regard to the navy, to|gether
with the nomination of the captains and all
inferior officers.</P>
<P>NONE of the&s;e councils can give orders them&s;elves,
except where they receive &s;uch powers from the &s;enate.
In other ca&s;es, they mu&s;t communicate every thing
to the &s;enate.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;enate is under adjournment, any of
the councils may a&s;&s;emble it before the day appointed
for its meeting.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e councils or courts, there is another
called the court of <HI>competitors;</HI> which is thus con&s;ti|tuted.
<PB N="364" REF="368">
If any candidates for the office of &s;enator have
have more votes than a third of the repre&s;entatives,
that candidate, who has mo&s;t votes, next to the &s;e|nator
elected, becomes incapable for one year of all
public offices, even of being a magi&s;trate or repre&s;en|tative:
But he takes his &s;eat in the court of com|petitors.
Here then is a court which may &s;ometimes
con&s;i&s;t of a hundred members, &s;ometimes have no
members at all; and by that means, be for a year
aboli&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE court of competitors has no power in the
commonwealth. It has only the in&s;pection of public
accounts, and the accu&s;ing any man before the &s;enate.
If the &s;enate acquit him, the court of competitors
may, if they plea&s;e, appeal to the people, either ma|gi&s;trates
or repre&s;entatives. Upon that appeal, the
magi&s;trates or repre&s;entatives meet on the day ap|pointed
by the court of competitors, and chu&s;e in
each county three per&s;ons; from which number every
&s;enator is excluded. The&s;e to the number of 300
meet in the capital, and bring the per&s;on accu&s;ed to
a new trial.</P>
<P>THE court of competitors may propo&s;e any law to
the &s;enate; and if refu&s;ed, may appeal to the people;
that is, to the magi&s;trates or repre&s;entatives, who ex|amine
it in their counties. Every &s;enator, who is
<PB N="365" REF="369">
thrown out of the &s;enate by a vote of the court, takes
his &s;eat in the court of competitors.</P>
<P>THE &s;enate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es all the judicative authority of
the hou&s;e of Lords, that is, all the appeals from the
inferior courts. It likewi&s;e nominates the Lord Chan|cellor,
and all the officers of the law.</P>
<P>EVERY county is a kind of republic within it&s;elf,
and the repre&s;entatives may make county-laws; which
have no authority 'till three months after they are
voted. A copy of the law is &s;ent to the &s;enate, and
to every other county. The &s;enate, or any &s;ingle
county, may, at any time, annul any law of another
county.</P>
<P>THE repre&s;entatives have all the authority of the
BRITISH ju&s;tices of peace in trials, commitments, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></P>
<P>THE magi&s;trates have the nomination of all the
officers of the revenue in each county. All cau&s;es
with regard to the revenue are appealed ultimately to
the magi&s;trates. They pa&s;s the accompts of all the
officers; but mu&s;t have all their own accompts ex|amined
and pa&s;&s;ed at the end of the year by the re|pre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>THE magi&s;trates name rectors or mini&s;ters to all
the pari&s;hes.</P>
<P><PB N="366" REF="370">
THE Pre&s;byterian government is e&s;tabli&s;hed; and

it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THE magi&s;trates may try, and depo&s;e or &s;u&s;pend

SWISSERLAND, which being well known, we &s;hall

this addition, that an army of 20,000 men be an|nually
drawn out by rotation, paid and encamped
during &s;ix weeks in &s;ummer; that the duty of a camp
may not be altogether unknown.</P>
<P>THE magi&s;trates nominate all the colonels and
downwards. The &s;enate all upwards. During war,
the general nominates the colonel and downwards,
and his commi&s;&s;ion is good for a twelvemonth. But
after that it mu&s;t be confirmed by the magi&s;trates of
the county to which the regiment belongs. The ma|gi&s;trates
may break any officer in the county regiment.
And the &s;enate may do the &s;ame to any officer in the
&s;ervice. If the magi&s;trates do not think proper to
confirm the general's choice, they may nominate ano|ther
officer in the place of him they reject.</P>

TEN thou&s;and, even tho' they were not annually

'Tis true, the nobles in POLAND are more

as power continues there always in the &s;ame per&s;ons

<P>ALL free governments mu&s;t con&s;i&s;t of two councils,

<P>A LARGE a&s;&s;embly of 1000, for in&s;tance, to repre|&s;ent

negative upon them, and the wor&s;t kind of negative,
that before re&s;olution.</P>
<P>HERE therefore is an inconvenience, which no go|vernment
has yet fully remedied, but which is the
ea&s;ie&s;t to be remedied in the world. If the people

<P>THE protector, the two &s;ecretaries, the council of

<P>THE capital, which we &s;hall call LONDON, may

therefore be divided into four counties. The repre|&s;entatives
of each of the&s;e chu&s;e one &s;enator, and ten
magi&s;trates. There are therefore in the city four &s;e|nators,
forty-four magi&s;trates, and four hundred re|pre&s;entatives.
The magi&s;trates have the &s;ame autho|rity
as in the counties. The repre&s;entatives al&s;o have
the &s;ame authority; but they never meet in one ge|neral
court: They give their votes in their particular
county, or divi&s;ion of hundreds.</P>
<GAP DESC="MISSING">
<P><PB N="368" REF="376">
WHEN they enact any city-law, the greate&s;t num|ber
of counties or divi&s;ions determines the matter.
And where the&s;e are equal, the magi&s;trates have the
ca&s;ting vote.</P>
<P>THE magi&s;trates chu&s;e the mayor, &s;heriff, recorder,
and other officers of the city.</P>
<P>IN the commonwealth, no repre&s;entative, magi|&s;trate,

&s;ecretaries, councils, and amba&s;&s;adors, have
&s;alaries.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t year in every century is &s;et apart to cor|rect
all inequalities, which time may have produced
in the repre&s;entative. This mu&s;t be done by the le|gi&s;lature.</P>
<P>THE following political aphori&s;ms may explain the
rea&s;on of the&s;e orders.</P>
<P>THE lower &s;ort of people and &s;mall proprietors
are good enough judges of one not very di&s;tant from
them in rank or habitation; and therefore, in their
parochial meetings, will probably chu&s;e the be&s;t, or
nearly the be&s;t repre&s;entative: But they are wholly
unfit for county-meetings, and for electing into the
higher offices of the republic. Their ignorance gives
the grandees an opportunity of deceiving them.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="377">
BUT le&s;t that &s;hould not be enough, their depen|dence
on the 10,000 for their elections, &s;erves to the
&s;ame purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>NOR is that all: For the 10,000 may re&s;ume the
power, whenever they plea&s;e; and not only when
they all plea&s;e, but when any five of a hundred plea&s;e,
which will happen upon the very fir&s;t &s;u&s;picion of a
&s;eparate intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THE 10,000 are too large a body either to unite
or divide, except when they meet in one place, and
fall under the guidance of ambitious leaders. Not to
mention their annual election, by almo&s;t the whole
body of the people.</P>
<P>A SMALL commonwealth is the happie&s;t govern|ment
in the world within it&s;elf; becau&s;e every thing
lies under the eye of the rulers: But it may be &s;ub|dued
by great force from without. This &s;cheme
&s;eems to have all the advantages both of a great and
a little commonwealth.</P>
<P>EVERY county-law may be annulled either by the
&s;enate or another county; becau&s;e that &s;hows an op|po&s;ition
of intere&s;t: In which ca&s;e no part ought to
decide for it&s;elf. The matter mu&s;t be referred to
the whole, which will be&s;t determine what agrees
with general intere&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="374" REF="378">
AS to the clergy and militia, the rea&s;ons of the&s;e
orders are obvious. Without the dependence of the
clergy on the civil magi&s;trate, and without a militia,
'tis folly to think any free government will ever have
&s;ecurity or &s;tability.</P>
<P>IN many governments, the inferior magi&s;trates have
no rewards but what ari&s;e from their ambition, va|nity,
or public &s;pirit. The &s;alaries of the FRENCH
judges amount not to the intere&s;t of the &s;ums they
pay for their offices. The DUTCH burgo-ma&s;ters
have little more immediate profit than the ENGLISH
ju&s;tices of peace, or the members of the hou&s;e of
commons formerly. But le&s;t any &s;hould &s;u&s;pect, that
this would beget negligence in the admini&s;tration,
(which is little to be feared, confidering the natural
ambition of mankind) let the magi&s;trates have com|petent
&s;alaries. The &s;enators have acce&s;s to &s;o many
honourable and lucrative offices, that their attendance
needs not be bought. There is little attendance re|quired
of the repre&s;entatives.</P>
<P>THAT the foregoing plan of government is prac|ticable,
no one can doubt, who con&s;iders the re&s;em|blance
it bears to the commonwealth of the United
Provinces, formerly one of the wi&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t re|nowned
governments that ever was in the world.
The alterations in the pre&s;ent &s;cheme are all evidently
to the better. 1. The repre&s;entation is more equal.
<GAP DESC="MISSING">
<PB N="371" REF="379">
them in intere&s;t, and unea&s;y in their pre&s;ent &s;iuation
will be &s;ure to take all advantages again&s;t them.</P>
<P>THE divi&s;ion of the &s;enate is prevented, 1. By
the &s;mallne&s;s of their number. 2. As faction &s;up|po&s;es
a combination to a &s;eparate intere&s;t, it is pre|vented
by their dependence on the people. 3. They
have a power of expelling any factious member. 'Tis
true, when another member of the &s;ame &s;pirit comes
from the county, they have no power of expelling
him: Nor is it fit they &s;hould; for that &s;hows the
humour to be in the people, and probably ari&s;es from
&s;ome ill conduct in public affairs. 4. Almo&s;t any
man, in a &s;enate &s;o regularly cho&s;en by the people,
may be &s;uppo&s;ed fit for any civil office. 'Twould be
proper, therefore, for the &s;enate to form &s;ome <HI>general</HI>
re&s;olutions with regard to the di&s;po&s;ing of offices
among the members: Which re&s;olutions would not
confine them in critical times, when extraordinary
parts on the one hand, or extraordinary &s;tupidity on
the other, appears in any &s;enator; but yet they would
be &s;ufficient to prevent brigue and faction, by mak|ing
the di&s;po&s;al of the offices a thing of cour&s;e. For
in&s;tance, let it be a re&s;olution, That no man &s;hall
enjoy any office, till he has &s;at four years in the &s;e|nate:
That, except amba&s;&s;adors, no man &s;hall be in
office two years following: That no man &s;hall attain
the higher offices but thro' the lower: That no man
<PB N="372" REF="380">
&s;hall be protector twice, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> The &s;enate of VENICE
govern them&s;elves by &s;uch re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>IN foreign politics the intere&s;t of the &s;enate can
&s;carce ever be divided from that of the people; and
therefore 'tis fit to make the &s;enate ab&s;olute with regard
to them; otherwi&s;e there could be no &s;ecrecy nor re|fined
policy. Be&s;ides, without money no alliance can
be executed; and the &s;enate is &s;till &s;ufficiently depen|dant.
Not to mention, that the legi&s;lative power
being always &s;uperior to the executive, the magi|&s;trates
or repre&s;entatives may interpo&s;e, whenever
they think proper.</P>
<P>THE chief &s;upport of the BRITISH government is
the oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts; but that, tho' in the main
&s;erviceable, breeds endle&s;s factions. In the foregoing
plan, it does all the good without any of the harm.
The <HI>competitors</HI> have no power of controlling the &s;e|nate:
They have only the power of accu&s;ing, and
appealing to the people.</P>
<P>'TIS nece&s;&s;ary, likewi&s;e, to prevent both combina|tion
and divi&s;ion in the thou&s;and magi&s;trates. This
is done &s;ufficiently by the &s;eparation of places and
intere&s;ts.</P>
<GAP DESC="MISSING">
<P><PB N="375" REF="381">
2. The unlimited power of the burgo-ma&s;ters in the
towns, which forms a perfect ari&s;tocracy in the DUTCH
commonwealth, is corrected by a well-tempered de|mocracy,
in giving to the people the annual election
of the county-repre&s;entatives. 3. The negative, which
every province and town has upon the whole body of
the DUTCH republic, with regard to alliances, peace
and war, and the impo&s;ition of taxes, is here removed.
4. The counties, in the pre&s;ent plan, are not &s;o inde|pendent
of each other, nor do they form &s;eparate bo|dies
&s;o much as the &s;even provinces; where the jea|lou&s;y
and envy of the &s;maller provinces and towns
again&s;t the greater, particularly HOLLAND and AM|STERDAM,
have frequently di&s;turbed the government.
5. Larger powers, tho' of the &s;afe&s;t kind, are in|tru&s;ted
to the &s;enate than the States-General po&s;&s;e&s;s;
by which means, the former may become more
expeditious, and &s;ecret in their re&s;olutions, than 'tis
po&s;&s;ible for the latter.</P>
<P>THE chief alterations that could be made on the
BRITISH government, in order to bring it to the
mo&s;t perfect model of limited monarchy, &s;eem to be
the following. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> The plan of the republican
parliament ought to be re&s;tored, by making the re|pre&s;entation
equal, and by allowing none to vote in
the county-elections who po&s;&s;e&s;s not a property of 200
pounds value. <HI>Secondly,</HI> As &s;uch a hou&s;e of Com|mons
would be too weighty for a frail hou&s;e of Lords,
<PB N="376" REF="382">
like the pre&s;ent, the Bi&s;hops and SCOTCH Peers ought
to be removed, who&s;e behaviour, <HI>in former parlia|ments,</HI>
de&s;troyed entirely the authority of that hou&s;e:
The number of the upper hou&s;e ought to be rai&s;ed to
three or four hundred: Their &s;eats not hereditary, but
during life: They ought to have the election of their
own members; and no commoner &s;hould be allowed
to refu&s;e a &s;eat that was offered him. By this means,
the hou&s;e of Lords would con&s;i&s;t entirely of the men
of chief credit, ability, and intere&s;t of the nation;
and every turbulent leader in the hou&s;e of Commons
might be taken off, and connected in intere&s;t with
the hou&s;e of Peers. Such an ari&s;tocracy would be an
excellent barrier both to the monarchy and again&s;t it.
At pre&s;ent, the balance of our government depends
in &s;ome mea&s;ure on the ability and behaviour of the
&s;overeign; which are variable and uncertain circum|&s;tances.</P>
<P>I ALLOW, that this plan of limited monarchy, how|ever
corrected, is &s;till liable to three great inconveni|encies.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It removes not entirely, tho' it may
&s;often, the parties of <HI>court</HI> and <HI>country. Secondly,</HI> The
King's per&s;onal character mu&s;t &s;till have a great influ|ence
on the government. <HI>Thirdly,</HI> The &s;word is in
the hands of a &s;ingle per&s;on, who will always neglect
to di&s;cipline the militia, in order to have a pretext
for keeping up a &s;tanding army. 'Tis evident, that
this is a mortal di&s;temper in the BRITISH govern|ment,
<PB N="377" REF="383">
of which it mu&s;t at la&s;t inevitably peri&s;h. I
mu&s;t, however, confe&s;s, that SWEDEN &s;eems, in
&s;ome mea&s;ure, to have remedied this inconvenience,
and to have a militia, with its limited monarchy, as
well as a &s;tanding army, which is le&s;s dangerous than
the BRITISH.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall conclude this &s;ubject, with ob&s;erving the
fal&s;ehood of the common opinion, that no large &s;tate,
&s;uch as FRANCE or BRITAIN, could ever be modelled
into a commonwealth, but that &s;uch a form of go|vernment
can only take place in a city or &s;mall ter|ritory.
The contrary &s;eems evident. Tho' 'tis more
difficult to form a republican government in an ex|ten&s;ive
country than in a city; there is more facility,
when once it is formed, of pre&s;erving it &s;teady and
uniform, without tumult and faction. 'Tis not ea&s;y,
for the di&s;tant parts of a large &s;tate to combine in any
plan of free government; but they ea&s;ily con&s;pire in
the e&s;teem and reverence for a &s;ingle per&s;on, who,
by means of this popular favour, may &s;eize the
power, and forcing the more ob&s;tinate to &s;ubmit,
may e&s;tabli&s;h a monarchical government. On the
other hand, a city readily concurs in the &s;ame notions
of government, the natural equality of property fa|vours
liberty, and the nearne&s;s of habitation enables
the citizens mutually to a&s;&s;i&s;t each other. Even un|der
ab&s;olute princes, the &s;ubordinate government of
cities is commonly republican; while that of coun|ties
<PB N="378" REF="384">
and provinces is monarchical. But the&s;e &s;ame cir|cum&s;tances,
which facilitate the erection of common|wealths
in cities, render their con&s;titution more frail
and uncertain. Democracies are turbulent. For
however the people may be &s;eparated or divided into
&s;mall parties, either in their votes or elections; their
near habitation in a city will always make the force
of popular tides and currents very &s;en&s;ible. Ari&s;to|cracies
are better adapted for peace and order, and
accordingly were mo&s;t admired by antient writers;
but they are jealous and oppre&s;&s;ive. In a large go|vernment,
which is modelled with ma&s;terly &s;kill, there
is compa&s;s and room enough to refine the democracy,
from the lower people, who may be admitted into
the fir&s;t elections or fir&s;t concoction of the common|wealth,
to the higher magi&s;trates, who direct all the
movements. At the &s;ame time, the parts are &s;o di&s;|tant
and remote, that 'tis very difficult, either by in|trigue,
prejudice, or pa&s;&s;ion, to hurry them into any
mea&s;ures again&s;t the public intere&s;t.</P>
<P>'TIS needle&s;s to inquire, whether &s;uch a govern|ment
would be immortal. I allow the ju&s;tne&s;s of the
poet's exclamation on the endle&s;s project, of human
race, <HI>Man and for ever!</HI> The world it&s;elf probably
is not immortal. Such con&s;uming plagues may ari&s;e
as would leave even a perfect government a weak
prey to its neighbours. We know not to what lengths
<PB N="379" REF="385">
enthu&s;ia&s;m, or other extraordinary motions of the
human mind, may tran&s;port men, to the neglect of
all order and public good. Where difference of in|tere&s;t
is removed, whim&s;ical and unaccountable fac|tions
often ari&s;e, from per&s;onal favour or enmity.
Perhaps ru&s;t may grow to the &s;prings of the mo&s;t
accurate political machine, and di&s;order its motions.
La&s;tly, exten&s;ive conque&s;ts, when pur&s;ued, mu&s;t be
the ruin of every free government; and of the more
perfect governments &s;ooner than of the imperfect;
becau&s;e of the very advantages which the former po&s;|&s;e&s;s
above the latter. And tho' &s;uch a &s;tate ought to
e&s;tabli&s;h a fundamental law again&s;t conque&s;ts; yet re|publics
have ambition as well as individuals, and pre|&s;ent
intere&s;t makes men forgetful of their po&s;terity.
'Tis a &s;ufficient incitement to human endeavours, that
&s;uch a government would flouri&s;h for many ages;
without pretending to be&s;tow on any work of man,
that immortality, which the Almighty &s;eems to have
refu&s;ed to his own productions.</P>
