<HEAD>KILKENNY.</HEAD>
<P>THIS county is bounded on the &s;outh by the county of Waterford; on the north by the Queen's county; on the we&s;t by the county of Tipperary; on the ea&s;t by the counties of Wex|ford and Catherlogh; and on the north-we&s;t by Up|per O&s;&s;ory. The greate&s;t length of this county from north to &s;outh, is forty miles, the breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t, twenty, and it contains ten baronies. It is one of the mo&s;t healthful, plea&s;ant, and po|pulous counties of Ireland; for it is &s;aid to have all the elements in perfection. The members &s;ent by it to parliament are &s;ixteen, viz. two for the county, two for Kilkenny, and two a-piece for Iri&s;h-town or St. Kennis, Gowran, Thoma&s;town, Callan, In|ni&s;tiock, and Knocktopher. This county is di|vided, as it were, into two parts, by the river Neor or Nura, which has its &s;ource in tho&s;e lofty
<PB N="4" REF="30">
mountains called the Slieu-bloom or Blandine|hills.</P>
<P>Kilkenny, the capital, takes its name from the cell or church of Canic, who was an eminent her|mit in this country. It is the &s;eat of the bi&s;hop of O&s;&s;ory, which was tran&s;lated from Agabo, in O&s;&s;ory, about the end of Henry II's reign, by bi&s;hop O Dullany. The city is divided into the Engli&s;h and Iri&s;h towns. The Engli&s;h town is much the newer and mo&s;t con&s;iderable; the other, (which is al&s;o called St. Kennys, or Canics, from the cathedral dedicated to that &s;aint, which &s;tands upon an eminence, where there is a mo&s;t de|lightful pro&s;pect) being only a kind of &s;uburbs. Both together make one of the large&s;t, mo&s;t wealthy, populous, and trading towns in the king|dom. Here are barracks for a troop of hor&s;e and four companies of foot, and a well endowed free|&s;chool, called the college. The &s;upreme council of the rebels under the pope's nuncio &s;at at Kil|kenny during the time of the general ma&s;&s;acre. The city is plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the Neor, a navi|gable river that di&s;charges it&s;elf into the harbour of Waterford. It is &s;aid of Kilkenny, that its air is without fog, its water without mud, its fire without &s;moke, and its &s;treets paved with marble. The two latter are, indeed, matter of fact; for they have, in the neighbourhood, a kind of coal that burns from fir&s;t to la&s;t without &s;moke, and pretty much re&s;embles the Wel&s;h coal. Mo&s;t of the &s;treets al&s;o are actually paved with a very good &s;ort of black marble, of which they have large quarries near the town, which takes a fine poli&s;h, and is beautifully intermixed with white granite. The air too is good and healthy, though not re|markably clearer than in many other parts of the kingdom. Here is the antient &s;eat of the Ormond family, which is an ornament to the city; and the
<PB N="5" REF="40">
neighbouring country is well cultivated and very fertile.</P>
<P>About two miles from this city, in the neigh|bourhood of the park-hou&s;e of Donmore, formerly occupied by the duke of Ormond, are a number of caves as curious, perhaps, as any mentioned in hi&s;tory, except tho&s;e of Antiparos in the Archi|pelago: we &s;hall pre&s;ent the reader with a de&s;crip|tion of them taken on the &s;pot, and &s;ent us by an ingenious gentleman of Dublin. "After a difficult de&s;cent of about one hundred feet, the entrance into this &s;ubterraneous world is gained. The ap|pearance of the fir&s;t cavern is uncommonly awful, and gives ri&s;e to an idea of a Gothic &s;tructure, grand in ruin. The &s;olemnity of this place is not a little encrea&s;ed by the gaiety of tho&s;e &s;cenes that pre&s;ent them&s;elves on every &s;ide, previous to our entering it. The floor is uneven, and &s;tones of various &s;izes are promi&s;cuou&s;ly di&s;per&s;ed upon it. The &s;ides are compo&s;ed of ragged work, in &s;ome parts covered with mo&s;s, and in others curiou&s;ly fro&s;ted; and from the roof, which is a kind of arch, &s;everal huge rocks project beyond each other, that &s;eem to threaten in&s;tant ruin. The circum|ference of this cave is not le&s;s than two hundred feet, and its height about fifty. Here is a &s;mall but continually dropping of water from the ceil|ing, and a few petrifactions re&s;embling icicles. This place has its inhabitants; for immediately on entering into it, you are &s;urprized with a confu&s;ed noi&s;e, which is occa&s;ioned by a multitude of wild pigeons. Hence there is a pa&s;&s;age towards the left, where, by a &s;mall a&s;cent, a kind of hole is gained, like, but larger, than the mouth of an oven, which introduces to a place, where, by the help of candles, day-light being entirely excluded, a broken and &s;urpri&s;ing &s;cene of mon&s;trous &s;tones, heaped on each other, chequered with various
<PB N="6" REF="50">
colours, inequality of rocks over-head, and an in|finity of &s;tatactical &s;tones, pre&s;ents it&s;elf. Nature, one would imagine, de&s;igned the fir&s;t cave as a preparative for what remains to be &s;een; by it the eye is familiarized to uncommon and awful ob|jects, and the mind tolerably fortified again&s;t tho&s;e ideas that re&s;ult from a combination of ap|pearances, unthought of, &s;urpri&s;ing, and mena|cing. The &s;pectator flatters him&s;elf that he has nothing to behold more awful, nor any thing more dangerous to meet, than what he finds in the fir&s;t cavern, but he &s;oon di&s;covers his mi&s;take; for the bare want of that light which dre&s;&s;es na|ture with gaiety is alone &s;ufficient to render the &s;econd far more dreadful. In the fir&s;t he fancies ruin frowns upon him from &s;everal parts; but in this it is threatened from a thou&s;and va&s;t rocks rudely piled on each other, that compo&s;e the &s;ides, which &s;eem bending in, and a multitude of no &s;maller &s;ize are pendent from the roof in the mo&s;t extraordinary manner: add to this, that by a fal&s;e &s;tep one would be da&s;hed from precipice to precipice. Indeed, it would be matter of much difficulty, or rather impracticable, to walk over this apartment, had not nature, as if &s;tudious for the &s;afety of the curious, cau&s;ed &s;orts of branches to &s;hoot from the &s;urface of the rocks, which are re|markably &s;mooth, very unequal, and always damp. The&s;e branches are from four to &s;ix inches in length, and nearly as thick. They are u&s;eful in the &s;ummits of the rocks to prevent &s;lipping, and in the &s;ides are ladders, whereby to de&s;cend and a&s;cend with tolerable facility. This a&s;toni&s;h|ing amfractuous pa&s;&s;age leads to a place far more curious than any of the re&s;t, On entering into it, one is almo&s;t induced to believe him&s;elf &s;ituated in an antient temple, decorated with all the expence of art; yet, notwith&s;tanding the beauty and &s;plen|dour
<PB N="7" REF="60">
that catches the eye on every &s;ide, there is &s;omething of &s;olemnity in the fa&s;hion of the place, which mu&s;t be felt by the mo&s;t ordinary &s;pectator. The floor, in &s;ome parts, is covered with a cry&s;tal|line &s;ub&s;tance; the &s;ides, in many places, are in|cru&s;ted with the &s;ame, wrought in a mode not un|like the Gothic &s;tile of ornament, and the top is almo&s;t intirely covered with inverted pyramids of the like elegantly white and lucid matter. At the points of the&s;e &s;tatactical &s;treets are perpetually hanging drops of pellucid water, for when one falls, another &s;ucceeds. The&s;e pendent gems contribute not a little to the glory of the roof, which, when the place is properly illuminated, appears as if formed of the pure&s;t cry&s;tal. Here are three extraordinary and beautiful congelations, which, without the aid of a &s;trong imagination, may be taken for an organ, altar, and cro&s;s. The former, except when &s;trictly examined, appears to be a regular work of art, and is of a con&s;idera|ble &s;ize; the &s;econd is of a &s;imple form, rather long than &s;quare; and the third reaches from the floor to the roof, which mu&s;t be about twenty feet. The&s;e curious figures are owing to water that fall from the upper parts of the cave to the ground, which coagulated into &s;tone from time to time, until at length it acquired tho&s;e forms which are now &s;o plea&s;ing; or to an ex&s;udation or ex|tillation of petrifying juices out of the earth; or perhaps they partake of the nature of &s;par, which is a kind of rock plant. The former &s;eems to be the mo&s;t probable &s;uppo&s;ition, as the&s;e figures, in colour and con&s;i&s;tence, appear exactly like the icicles on the top, which are only &s;een from the wet parts of the caverns; and in this place there is a greater oozing of water, and a much larger number of petrifactions than in any other. When this curious apartment has been &s;ufficiently ex|amined,
<PB N="8" REF="70">
the guides lead you for a con&s;iderable way through winding places, until a glimmering light agreeably &s;urprizes. Here the journey of above a quarter of a mile, through tho&s;e parts, is ended: but, upon returning into the fir&s;t cavern, the entrance into other appartments, le&s;s curious indeed, but as exten&s;ive as tho&s;e we have de&s;cribed, offers it&s;elf. The pa&s;&s;ages into &s;ome of tho&s;e are &s;o very low, that there is a nece&s;&s;ity of creeping through them: by the&s;e we proceed until the noi&s;e of a &s;ubterranean river is heard, but farther none have ventured.</P>
<P>Gowran is a con&s;iderable town and corporation, with a &s;trong ca&s;tle. It had formerly walls, and gave title of baron to the lord Cutts, but now to the earl of Upper-O&s;&s;ory.</P>
<P>Thoma&s;town. The Iri&s;h name of this town is Bala-mac-Andan, and both it and the Engli&s;h name are derived from the founder Thomas Fitz-Anthony, an Engli&s;hman, who lived in the reign of Henry III. and who&s;e de&s;cendants were long lords of it. It &s;tands al&s;o on the river Nure, or Neor, is fortified, and reckoned the &s;econd town of the county.</P>
<P>Inni&s;tiock, or Enne&s;teog, is a con&s;iderable town on the banks of the Neor.</P>
<P>St. Kenny's, alias Iri&s;h-town, Callan, Knockto|pher, and Ballyragget, are &s;mall places.</P>
<P>Ca&s;tlecomer, a village famous for its coal-pits, gives the title of vi&s;count to the earl of Wande&s;|ford, and Killaghy that of baron to the earl of Tyrconnel.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>WEXFORD, or WEISFORD.</HEAD>
<P>This county has Wicklow on the north; St. George's-channel on the &s;outh and &s;outh-we&s;t; and part of Catherlogh and Kilkenny on the we&s;t.
<PB N="9" REF="80">
Its greate&s;t length is about forty-&s;even miles, breadth about twenty-&s;even, and contains eight baronies. The air is good, but the &s;oil various. In &s;ome places it is coar&s;e and poor, in others fruitful both in corn and gra&s;s. The county &s;ends eighteen members to parliament; namely, two for the county, and two for each of the boroughs of Wexford, New-Ro&s;s, Enne&s;corthy, Feathard, New|borough, Bannow, Clomines, Taghman.</P>
<P>Wexford, or Weisford, the capital of the coun|ty, is a large, antient town, at the mouth of the Slane, the fir&s;t place the Engli&s;h got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of when they invaded Ireland in 1170, and is now much frequented by &s;trangers in &s;ummer, on ac|count of a chalybeate &s;pring near it. Here is a very good harbour for ve&s;&s;els of con&s;iderable burden, and barracks for two companies of foot, with a very antient ca&s;tle &s;till &s;tanding. Both Wexford and Waterford give title of earl to the Talbots, earls of Shrew&s;bury, in England.</P>
<P>New-Ro&s;s had antiently walls, with a cathedral and bi&s;hop; but the &s;ee was afterwards united to that of Cork. Here are barracks for a troop of hor&s;e, and a key, to which &s;hips of good burden come up the river, formed by the conjunction of the Nure and Barrow, and called the river of Ro&s;s. This town is &s;till a place of con&s;iderable trade, but was antiently larger and more populous than it is at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Duncannon. Here are barracks for three com|panies of foot, with a &s;trong fort upon the river Barrow, which it commands &s;o entirely, that no &s;hip can get to Ro&s;s or Water&s;ord out of the reach of its guns. On the extremity of the neck of land that &s;hoots here into the &s;ea is a tower, called Hook-tower, and a light-hou&s;e for the direction of mariners. This place gives title of vi&s;count to the earl of Be&s;borough.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="90">
Feathard &s;tands on the &s;ame river as Duncannon; and has a harbour for &s;hips.</P>
<P>Enni&s;corthy, a &s;mall town, &s;tands at the con|flux of the Urrin and Slane, and has barracks for two companies of foot.</P>
<P>Fernes, a &s;mall place, had formerly a ca&s;tle, and is now the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, to which Leighlin has been united &s;ince the year 1600.</P>
<P>Newborough, alias Gorey, is a &s;mall town, giving title of baron to the earl of Cholmondeley, an Engli&s;h peer.</P>
<P>Bennow, Clomines, and Taghman, are all &s;mall places.</P>
<P>In this county is the barony of Shelburn, which belongs, and gives title of earl, to the family of Petty.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The PROVINCE of CONNAUGHT.</HEAD>
<P>On the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t, it is &s;eparated from Mun&s;ter by the Shannon; by the &s;ame river from Lein&s;ter on the ea&s;t; on the we&s;t it is bounded by the main ocean; and on the north and north-we&s;t by the province of Ul&s;ter, and a part of the we&s;|tern ocean. Its length is about one hundred and thirty-miles, its breadth about eighty-four, and its circumference about five hundred. According to Templeman it contains an area of &s;ix thou&s;and and &s;eventy-two &s;quare miles. It is divided into &s;ix counties, and three hundred and &s;ixty-&s;ix pari&s;hes, in which are one archbi&s;hopric, two bi|&s;hoprics, &s;even market-towns, and twelve boroughs that &s;end members to parliament. Of the four provinces in Ireland, this is the mo&s;t mountainous and barren, the lea&s;t cultivated and enclo&s;ed, the thinne&s;t of inhabitants, and the&s;e inhabitants the
<PB N="11" REF="100">
mo&s;t ignorant and unpoli&s;hed, being many of them Roman catholics equally blind, bigotted, and &s;u|per&s;titious. "If there are any wild Iri&s;h to be found, &s;ays the intelligent author of the Hibernia Curio&s;a, in any part of the kingdom, it is in the we&s;tern part of this province, where they have the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e of law and government, and where the haughty and tyrannic landlords have almo&s;t depo|pulated the country by their oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures. The will and plea&s;ure of the chiefs, as in the High|lands of Scotland, is ab&s;olute law to the poor inha|bitants that are connected with them, who live in the mo&s;t abject &s;lavery under their petty &s;overeigns." Grazing is the chief employment of the pea&s;ants. Immen&s;e numbers of &s;heep and bullocks are bred in this province, particularly in the counties of Clare and Gallway. All over the kingdom, but e&s;pecially in this province, the lands are let in &s;mall parcels of twenty or thirty pounds a year, at third, fourth, and fifth hand from the fir&s;t proprietor. Hence it comes to pa&s;s, that the landlords, fir&s;t and &s;ubordinate, obtain all that is made of the land, and the tenants, for their labour, get poverty and potatoes. This province abounds in hor&s;es, game, veni&s;on, honey, and hawks; it is al&s;o well &s;up|plied with fi&s;h, having many convenient bays and creeks on the coa&s;t, and &s;everal rivers, parti|cularly the Shannon, Moy, Suck, Dro&s;os, and Gyll. Its foreign trade, however, is very incon|&s;iderable. The air of the province was formerly indifferent on account of the bogs and woods, but is now much altered for the better. The names of the counties in this province are Thomond, or Clare, Gallway, Mayo, Ro&s;common, Sligoe, and Leitrim, of which in order.</P>

<HEAD>THOMOND, or CLARE.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which is called by the Iri&s;h Towown, and was antiently reckoned a part of Mun&s;ter, has the county of Gallway on the north; on the ea&s;t and &s;outh is parted by the Shannon from Tipperary, Limeric, and Kerry, in Mun&s;ter; and on the we&s;t is bounded by the ocean. It is about forty miles in length, thirty-eight in breadth, and contains about four hundred and twenty-eight thou&s;and one hundred and eighty-&s;even acres, divided into nine baronies, in which are two market-towns and one parliamentary bo|rough, namely Ennis, which &s;ends one member to parliament, and the county another. The latter gives al&s;o the title of earl to a branch of the family of Obrian, as Inchiquin does to another branch.</P>
<P>Ennis is the county-town, and by much the be&s;t in it, &s;tanding about two miles from Dublin, on a lake formed by the Shannon, and has a market.</P>
<P>Killaloe, a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, with the privilege of a fair and market, &s;tands on the Shannon, and was once much more con&s;iderable than at pre&s;ent. The bi&s;hop, in Latin, is called epi&s;copus Laonen&s;is, or Laden&s;is. His dioce&s;e, &s;ince that of Ro&s;cree was united to it, about the end of the twelfth century, is very large, containing an hundred pari&s;h churches, be&s;ides chapels. A little to the &s;outh of this town is a ridge of rocks, which run quite a-cro&s;s the river Shannon, and &s;top all navigation further up.</P>
<P>Kilfernora, or Kilkennerag, though at pre&s;ent an incon&s;iderable place, was formerly a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, which is now united to the bi&s;hopric of Clon|fert.</P>
<P>Clare, &s;tanding on a creek of the Shannon that is full of i&s;lands, gives the title of baron to a branch of the family of Nugent, and name to the
<PB N="13" REF="120">
county, of which it was once the capital. It took its name from Richard and Thomas de Clare, younger &s;ons of the earl of Glouce&s;ter, to whom Edward I. gave the county; and who built &s;everal towns and ca&s;tles in it, one in particular here, to which they gave their name. At this place are barracks for two companies of foot, and a &s;eat of the earl of Thomond.</P>
<P>Bunrotty is a little town near the Shannon. It had antiently a ca&s;tle, and a &s;eat of the earls of Tho|mond, to whom it belongs.</P>

<HEAD>GALLWAY.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded on the &s;outh by Tho|mond; on the north and north-ea&s;t by Mayo, Meath, and Ro&s;common; on the we&s;t by the main ocean; and on the ea&s;t and &s;outh-ea&s;t by part of Ro&s;common, King's-county, and Tipperary, from which la&s;t it is parted by the Shannon. It is the large&s;t county but one in Ireland, extending in length eighty-two miles, in breadth forty-eight, and containing thirteen baronies, in which are about &s;even hundred and &s;eventy-five thou&s;and five hundred and twenty-five acres. Both the air and &s;oil of this county are in general good; and if the latter is any where bad or indifferent, there is plenty of lime&s;tone wherewith to improve it. It is pretty fertile in corn, pa&s;ture, and cattle, e&s;pe|cially in the &s;outh and ea&s;t parts, where it is be&s;t inhabited. On the we&s;t &s;ide it has many bays, rocks, and i&s;lands, among which is one called Ar|ran, that gives title of earl to the family of Gore.
<PB N="14" REF="130">
This county &s;ends eight members to parliament, namely, two for it&s;elf, and two for each of the bo|roughs of Gallway, Athenree, and Tuam.</P>
<P>Gallway is not only the capital of the county, but the &s;econd or third town in the kingdom. It is &s;eated near a noble bay, which running above thirty miles up into the country from the we&s;tern ocean, has many harbours and roads on every &s;ide; and is &s;heltered by &s;everal i&s;les at its mouth, between which are broad and deep channels called &s;ounds. It is a very neat, &s;trong, and flouri&s;hing city; and be|ing admirably &s;ituated for a trade not only to France and Spain, but al&s;o to the We&s;t-Indies, has a &s;et of as &s;ub&s;tantial merchants and &s;hopkeepers, as any city in the three kingdoms of its extent. The buildings, both public and private, are generally of &s;tone, and hand&s;ome. The harbour is about two miles from the city, to which the goods are brought in lighters. Here are barracks for two companies of foot. The city is walled, and was once the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, but is now within the archbi&s;hopric of Tuam. It carries on a very con|&s;iderable herring fi&s;hery, and is almo&s;t the only place upon this coa&s;t that has any foreign trade. Lough-Corrib, at who&s;e fall into the bay the city &s;tands, is of great length but not above five miles in breadth. Cambden tells us that it contains, in|cluding tho&s;e in the bay, three hundred i&s;lands co|vered with gra&s;s and pines. Gallway gives the title of vi&s;count to the family of Moncton.</P>
<P>Tuam has been the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop ever &s;ince the beginning of the &s;ixth century; and tho' now but a poor place, was once a famous city. It gives the title of vi&s;count to the family of Wen|men.</P>
<P>Athenry contains barracks for three companies of foot. This place was antiently walled, and more con&s;iderable than it is at pre&s;ent. It gives title of
<PB N="15" REF="140">
baron to the earl of Louth, of the name of Ber|mingham.</P>
<P>Clonfert, though the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, is but a poor decayed place.</P>
<P>Aghrim, where in 1691 general Ginkle obtained a great victory over the Iri&s;h and French, killing &s;even thou&s;and, and taking about &s;ix hundred and fifty of them, together with the French general St. Ruth, pri&s;oners, is little better than a village, but has a ca&s;tle, and gives the title of baron to a de|&s;cendant of general Ginkle.</P>
<P>Eyres-Court is a pretty little thriving town.</P>
<P>Gort is only a &s;mall town.</P>
<P>Portumna, Headford, and Loughrea, are &s;mall places, having barracks each for a troop of hor&s;e.</P>

<P>This county is bounded on the &s;outh and &s;outh-ea&s;t by the county of Gallway; on the north-ea&s;t by Sligoe; by Ro&s;common on the ea&s;t; and by the &s;ea on the we&s;t and north. It is fifty-eight miles long, and forty-four broad, containing &s;even hundred and twenty-four thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and forty acres, which are divided into nine baronies. There is but one borough in the county, namely, Ca&s;tlebar, which &s;ends two members to parliament. As it has the &s;ea on one &s;ide, and abounds in lakes, the air is moi&s;t and cold, e&s;pecially upon the mountains, where the &s;oil al&s;o is poor and coar&s;e; but in the other parts there is good pa&s;turage, with herds of cattle and deer, honey, fi&s;h, hawks, &amp;c.</P>

from &s;ixty-eight miles to one hundred and twenty, and its circumference, including the windings, above &s;ix hundred miles. This pro|vince, with the county of Thomond in Connaught, formed a petty kingdom before the Engli&s;h in|vaded and conquered Ireland. The air of the province is temperate and healthful: as to the &s;oil, the plains and vallies, where properly culti|vated, are fruitful both in corn and gra&s;s, but the mountains are bleak and barren.

<P>Waterford, &s;tanding upon the river Sure, was fir&s;t built by certain pirates of Norway, and hath been a bi&s;hop's-&s;ee ever &s;ince the year 1096,
<PB N="21" REF="200">
when the&s;e pirates, who had embraced chri&s;tianity|&s;ent Malchus, a Benedictine monk of Winche&s;ter, to be con&s;ecrated their bi&s;hop by An&s;elmn, arch|bi&s;hop of Canterbury. Till it was eclip&s;ed by Cork, it was accounted the &s;econd city in the kingdom for trade, wealth, and populou&s;ne&s;s, being &s;ituated on a fine harbour, defended by Duncannon fort on the ea&s;t &s;ide. The &s;oil, how|ever, about it is barren, and the air thick. Many con&s;iderable privileges have been conferred upon it by the kings of England, as a reward for its con&s;tant fidelity, &s;ince it was fir&s;t reduced by Richard, earl of Pembroke. During the Iri&s;h rebellion it was in the hands of the rebels, who often made excur&s;ions from it, and committed great outrages; but Oliver Cromwell reduced it in 1650. The popi&s;h party got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it al&s;o in 1689, and held it till after the battle of the Boyn. Here is a fine cathedral; but the hou&s;es are generally of timber, and make but a mean ap|pearance. The city drives a great trade, particu|larly with England, and &s;hips of burden come up clo&s;e to its fine key. Waterford haven extends near eight miles and a half from &s;outh to north, almo&s;t in a &s;trait line, all the way deep and clear, and but little encumbered with rocks or &s;and. The city and its liberties make a di&s;tinct county. There is a citadel on the we&s;t &s;ide, and on the ea&s;t a block-hou&s;e and &s;tore-hou&s;e. "What detracts from the figure and appearance, &s;ays the author of the Hibernia Curio&s;a, of much the greater number, even of the large&s;t towns of Ireland, of which this is one, is the dirty entrances, and the long &s;trings of de&s;picable huts, or cabbins, that mo&s;t of them are pre|faced with, the inland towns e&s;pecially, into which one is generally introduced thro' a line of fifty or one hundred of tho&s;e habitations of pover|ty

Waterford, jointly with Wexford, or Weisford, gives the title of earl to the earl of Shrew&s;bury in England, and is the county town.</P>
<P>Dungarvan has a ca&s;tle and walls, gives title of vi&s;count to the earl of Cork and Orrery; but tho' it &s;tands on the &s;ea, and has a tide-haven, it is a place of no great con&s;equence or trade.</P>
<P>Li&s;more is an inland town upon the river Broad|water, or Black-water, and was once the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, which hath been annexed to that of Waterford ever &s;ince the year 1363.

<P>Tallow, or Tallagh, is &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant fertile vale near the river Black-water, which, be|ing navigable from hence to Youghall, renders it a place of good trade. James I. made it a cor|poration.</P>

<HEAD>CORK.</HEAD>
<P>This county is the large&s;t in the kingdom, con|taining near a million of acres, plantation mea&s;ure, divided into fifteen baronies. It is bounded on the ea&s;t by the county of Waterford; by Kerry and the ocean on the we&s;t; Limerick on the north; and the Vergivian-&s;ea on the &s;outh and &s;outh|ea&s;t. Including De&s;mond, it is eighty-five miles in length, and fifty in breadth; but is very un|equal both ways. Tho' a con&s;iderable part of the county is boggy, mountainous, and barren, yet, by the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, it is pretty well cultivated and improved, and contains &s;everal good towns and harbours. The rivers with which it is watered, and the &s;ea, &s;upply it with plenty of fi&s;h. Be&s;ides the two knights of the &s;hire, and two members for the city of Cork, it &s;ends two to parliament for each of the following boroughs, viz. Youghall, King&s;ale, Bandon|bridge, Moyallow, Baltimore, Cloghnikilly, Char|leville, Ca&s;tlemartyr, Middleton, Rathcomuck, and Doneraile. This county, which in Latin is denominated Comitatus Corcagien&s;is, is the mo&s;t populous and con&s;iderable of any in Ireland, next to that of Dublin.</P>
<P>Cork city is much the large&s;t and mo&s;t popu|lous in the kingdom, next to the capital. It is en|compa&s;&s;ed not only by walls, but al&s;o by the chan|nel of the river Lee, over which it has bridges on all &s;ides. Cork is an epi&s;copal &s;ee, and a city of great trade, &s;ituated fifteen miles up the river. Though &s;maller ve&s;&s;els can come up to the key, yet the larger generally ride at a place called Pa&s;|&s;age. The city, together with its liberties, makes
<PB N="24" REF="230">
a county, and is governed by a mayor, aldermen, and &s;heriffs. It has the mo&s;t trade of any town in the kingdom, particularly in beef, butter, and tallow, of which great quantities are exported to France, Holland, Flanders, and the colonies; and many &s;hips bound to the We&s;t-Indies put in here to victual. It had &s;everal abbeys formerly, and has now many hand&s;ome public &s;tructures, par|ticularly a cathedral, cu&s;tom-hou&s;e, and two gates, one on the north and the other on the &s;outh. In the rebellion in 1641, it made a gallant defence again&s;t the rebels under the earl of Inchiquin; but fell afterwards into their hands, and was held by them till Cromwell recovered it. The rebels al&s;o got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in 1690, but it was retaken by the duke of Marlborough. Five miles below Cork, the channel of the river is divided into two by an i&s;land, on which are &s;everal villages. "Cork, &s;ays the author of the Hibernia Curio&s;a, has the greate&s;t trade of any in the kingdom, next to Dublin; and, indeed, is in the be&s;t &s;ituation for commerce. Its exports of beef and butter appear to be greater than tho&s;e of any town in the king's dominions. The quantity of beef that is killed here from Michaelmas to Chri&s;tmas is amazing; for three or four months at this time, a &s;tranger would imagine it was the &s;laughter-hou&s;e of Ire|land. Cork is nearly as large as Bri&s;tol, but infi|nitely better &s;ituated as to its navigation, at the bottom of a large, capacious, well &s;heltered bay or cove. A con&s;iderable part of the city is &s;itu|ated upon a flat, that was originally a mora&s;s, which, by the indu&s;try of the inhabitants, hath been rai&s;ed &s;everal feet. Here continual additions are making to the many &s;pacious &s;treets already built. But what contributes greatly to the beauty as well as convenience of this part of the town and its trade, is the channels that are carried thro' mo&s;t
<PB N="25" REF="240">
of the principal &s;treets; &s;o that merchandize of every kind can be brought by water to, or &s;hip|ped from the very warehou&s;es of the merchants, who re&s;ide chiefly in this lower and modern part of the city, in hou&s;es really magnificent and &s;u|perb, that at the &s;ame exhibit the wealth of their owners, and are an ornament to the town. A large and elegant theatre hath been lately built here, in which dramatic performances are exhibited by a company from Dublin, during the &s;ummer va|cation at the capital. Cork, indeed, may very ju&s;tly be e&s;teemed the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing city in Ire|land. The hou&s;es, in general, are well built, but the &s;treets are many of them too narrow. Its churches are unexceptionably the neate&s;t and the mo&s;t elegantly fini&s;hed of any in the kingdom for the number it contains." This city and Orrery, the name of a barony in this county, give both the title of earl to the noble family of Boyle.</P>
<P>King&s;ale &s;tands at the mouth of the river Bann, or Bandon, and is reckoned the third town in the kingdom, and only inferior to Cork in point of trade. Va&s;t quantities of provi&s;ions are &s;hipped off from hence to Flanders, Holland, France, and the We&s;t-Indies. The port indeed is barred, but &s;hips of any burden may get over the bar at high|water. On a point of land, called the old head of King&s;ale, is a light-hou&s;e to guide &s;hips in the night to the mouth of the river. The town is neat, well built, wealthy, and extremely well for|tified with lines and outworks. About two miles below the town are two &s;trong forts, one on each &s;ide the river, which &s;ecure it again&s;t all attempts by &s;ea. In 1601, eight thou&s;and Spaniards landed here to join the rebels; but, upon finding that they had been defeated by the lord-deputy, ba|ron Montjoy, they took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this town, which they were obliged, however, after an ob|&s;tinate
<PB N="26" REF="250">
defence, to &s;urrender by capitulation, and to quit the i&s;land. King&s;ale gives the title of baron to the very antient family of Courcy.</P>
<P>Ro&s;&s;e is now but a village; but was at one time more con&s;iderable, when it had a good harbour, now barred up, and was the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;ince united to Cork. It gives the title of earl to the family of Par&s;ons.</P>
<P>Bandon-bridge was fortified formerly with walls and &s;everal ca&s;tles, which were demoli&s;hed by the French and Iri&s;h in 1690. The inhabitants are &s;aid to amount to about three thou&s;and, all pro|te&s;tants. As it &s;tands on both &s;ides the river Ban|don, the two divi&s;ions are joined by a bridge, whence it takes its name.</P>
<P>Baltimore, a &s;mall borough, giving the title of baron to the family of Calvert, has a &s;afe com|modious haven on the &s;ea, but very little trade.</P>
<P>A little to the &s;outhward, near the coa&s;t, lies Cape Clear, an i&s;land &s;o called from its cape. Some &s;hips of war are generally &s;tationed here in time of war, to guard the coa&s;t again&s;t privateers: be&s;ides, here is a ca&s;tle on the i&s;land, under who&s;e cannon &s;hips often come to anchor, it &s;tanding very conveniently for all &s;uch as are bound from Ireland to the &s;outhward, or vice ver&s;a.</P>
<P>Youghall is a pretty good town, with a conve|nient harbour at the mouth of the Broad or Black|water.</P>

Mo&s;t of them, however, have barracks for a troop of hor&s;e or a company of &s;oot. Charleville gives the

title of earl to the family of Moore; Middleton and Doneraile tho&s;e of vi&s;counts, the fir&s;t to the family of Broderick, and the other to that of St. Leger. Buttevant gives the title of vi&s;count, and Barrymore that of earl to the family of Barry. Grandi&s;on gives the title of earl to the family of Villiers; Carberry that of baron to the family of Evans; Dunamore to the family of Hawley; Al|tham to the earl of Angle&s;ey; and Burton to the earl of Egmont. De&s;mond, a di&s;trict in this county, which was formerly a county of it&s;elf, gives the title of earl to the family of Fielding.</P>
<P>On this coa&s;t, be&s;ides Youghall-bay, and the havens or bay of Cork, Kin&s;ale, and Baltimore, are tho&s;e of Dunmanus and Bautry, both very large. The la&s;t divides the county of Cork from that of Kerry.</P>

<P>This county has that of Limerick on the north; the Atlantic ocean on the we&s;t; and the county of Cork on the &s;outh and ea&s;t. De&s;mond, which was once reckoned a county palatine, under the earls of De&s;mond, de&s;cended from one of the an|tient petty Iri&s;h kings, makes a part of this coun|ty; the re&s;t of it lies in the county of Cork. The greate&s;t length of the county of Kerry is about &s;ixty miles, and breadth forty-&s;even. It contains about &s;ix hundred and thirty-&s;even thou&s;and acres, divided into eight baronies, and &s;ends eight mem|bers to parliament, viz. two for the county, and two for each of the following boroughs, Dingle, Tralee, and Ardfert. The air of this county is whole&s;ome, but &s;harp; and the &s;oil of &s;ome parti|cular &s;pots fruitful both in corn and gra&s;s; but great part of the county is mountainous, dreary, barren, and almo&s;t uninhabited.</P>
<P><PB N="28" REF="270">

<P>Smerwic, Ca&s;tle-I&s;land, Lixnaw, Li&s;towell, and Kilarney, are &s;mall places.</P>
<P>This la&s;t gives name to a lake, one of the mo&s;t beautiful, perhaps, in the world. This lake, which may not improperly be di&s;tingui&s;hed into three, the upper, lower, and middle, excepting one nar|row valley on the &s;outh, thro' which a river runs into the upper lake, is &s;urrounded with one con|tinued range of lofty mountains, rocks, and pre|cipices, the immen&s;e declivities of which are co|vered with woods intermixed with ever-greens, from nearly their tops down to the verge of the lakes; add to this the number of rivulets ca&s;cad|ing from channels &s;kirted with trees of every kind down the &s;ides of the&s;e enormous mountains, &s;ome of them to the height of a hundred yards. Over the lake are di&s;per&s;ed a great number of i&s;lands of very different extent, and all of them of any &s;ize, one only excepted, which is inhabited by an innumerable &s;ight of rabbits, beautifully orna|mented with trees of every kind, with a mo&s;t de|lightful intermixture of ever-greens, as box, holly, yew, and the arbutus, or &s;trawberry-tree. Hol|lies of a prodigious magnitude are found here,
<PB N="29" REF="280">
&s;ome of above two feet diameter in the body of the tree. The arbutus grows in great plenty and per|fection on many of the i&s;lands; the large&s;t of them are about &s;ix or &s;even inches in diameter, and fifteen or twenty feet high. They appear in their greate&s;t beauty and perfection about November. There is a mo&s;t enchanting pro&s;pect from &s;ome of the &s;urrounding mountains, particularly from a very lofty one called the Turk, becau&s;e its white chalky top looks like a Turki&s;h turban. On the very &s;ummit of one of the Mangerton mountains, in the neighbourhood, is a &s;mall round lake, of about a quarter of a mile diameter a-cro&s;s the top, called the Devil's Punch-bowl. From the &s;urface of the lake to the top of the &s;ides of this va&s;t concavity or bowl, may be about three hundred yards; and when viewed from the circular top, it really has a mo&s;t a&s;toni&s;hing appearance. The depth of it, doubtle&s;s, is va&s;tly great, but not, as the natives of it pretend, unfathomable. The di&s;charge of the &s;uperfluous waters of this bowl, thro' a cha&s;m or gap into the middle lake, forms one of the fine&s;t ca&s;cades in the world, vi&s;ible for above one hundred and fifty yards. The Devil's Punch|bowl, as it is called in our maps, by the natives in the neighbourhood, is termed Poulier infrin, that is, the hole of hell. The echoes among the hills in the &s;outhern and more enclo&s;ed parts of the great lake, but e&s;pecially in the winding, deep, and intricate valley leading from the lower to the upper lake, are equally delightful and a&s;toni&s;hing. There are &s;ome cannon placed in the mo&s;t advan|tageous &s;ituations by the lord Kenmare, a Roman catholic nobleman, on purpo&s;e for the entertain|ment of travellers, who generally provide them|&s;elves with ammunition for loading them. The reports, on the di&s;charge of the&s;e cannon, re&s;em|ble the neare&s;t of any thing in nature a mo&s;t vio|lent peal of thunder rolling among the mountains.

Here al&s;o mu&s;ical in&s;truments, e&s;pecially the horn and trumpet, afford the mo&s;t delightful and ra|vi&s;hing entertainment to the ear; and to a &s;port&s;|man nothing can equal the &s;pirit and elevating joy of a &s;tag-hunt among the woods and mountains about the lake of Kilarny, where the cry of the hounds, the harmony of the horns re&s;ounding from the hills on every &s;ide, the univer&s;al &s;houts of joy along the valleys, and from the &s;ides of the mountains, re-echoing from hill to hill, and from rock to rock, gives the highe&s;t &s;atisfaction and delight that can po&s;&s;ibly ari&s;e from the chace. The &s;tag is rouzed from the woods that &s;kirt the lake, in which there are many of them that run wild by nature, like deer in an ea&s;tern fore&s;t, and are pro|perly enough called wild &s;tags. The gentlemen who attend the hunt are generally in boats on the lake, during the diver&s;ion; for to follow it by land, either on foot or hor&s;eback, is impracti|cable. In &s;ome of the high craggy inacce&s;&s;ible rocks that &s;urround the lakes, eagles are &s;ometimes known to build, but their number is not con&s;ide|rable. There is, indeed, one mo&s;t &s;tupendous and frightful rock, the front of which, to the water, is a mo&s;t horrible precipice, called the eagles ne&s;t, from its being &s;eldom without a ne&s;t of them upon its top. On the ea&s;tern &s;ide is a rich and fertile plain for two or three miles, thro' which de&s;cends a river into the lower lake; and thro' a valley at the we&s;t end, the whole collection of waters di&s;charge them&s;elves into the &s;ea. On the north ea&s;t &s;ide &s;tands the town of Kilarny, in a delightful &s;ituation; and, in the &s;ummer|time, from the number of vi&s;itors to the lake, is a very chearful lively town, being as much the fa&s;hion in Ireland to vi&s;it this lake at that &s;ea&s;on, as it is el&s;ewhere to go to drink the waters at the public &s;pas, or to bathe in the &s;ea.

Wild bea&s;ts, &s;uch as bears, wolves, lynxes, wild boars, and foxes, are not uncommon. It is well &s;upplied with fi&s;h from its lakes and rivers; and on the coa&s;ts of the Baltic are found great quantities of amber, in which are often inclo&s;ed leaves, minerals, flies, &s;piders, gnats, ants, fi&s;hes, frogs, drops of water, pieces of wood, and grains of &s;and; whence it is evident, that it was once in a fluid &s;tate.

near, or hard by. In the thirteenth cen|tury the knights of the Teutonic order made a conque&s;t of the whole country, in which they committed the mo&s;t inhuman barbarities; for in|&s;tead of converting, which they pretended was their view, they extirpated the natives, and placed the Germans, their countrymen, in their &s;tead. In the year 1454, one half of Pru&s;&s;ia revolted from the knights, and put it&s;elf under the protection of Poland. This occa&s;ioned an almo&s;t continual war betwixt that country and the Order till 1525, when, by a treaty concluded at Cracow, it was a|greed, that Albert, margrave of Brandenburg, the thirty-fourth and la&s;t ma&s;ter of the order, &s;hould have the ea&s;tern part, under the title of a duchy, and that it &s;hould de&s;cend to his and his brother's male heirs, as a fief of Poland; but in 1657 the elector Frederic-William had the &s;ove|reignty of it confirmed to him and his heirs, on condition of its returning to the Poles, in ca&s;e of the failure of heirs male.

The Crapack or Carpathian mountains, &s;eparate it from Hungary on the &s;outh. The &s;oil is very fruitful both in corn and pa&s;turage, hemp, and flax.

Va&s;t quan|tities of corn are yearly &s;ent down the Vi&s;tula to Dantzic, from all parts of Poland, and bought up chiefly by the Dutch. The ea&s;tern part of the country is full of woods, fore&s;ts, lakes, mar&s;hes, and rivers, of the la&s;t of which, the mo&s;t con&s;i|derable in Poland are, the Vi&s;tula, Nieper, Nie&s;|ter, Duna, Bog, Warta, and Memel. The me|tals found in this kingdom are iron and lead, with &s;ome tin, gold, and &s;ilver; but there are no mines of the two la&s;t wrought at pre&s;ent. The other products of Poland are mo&s;t &s;orts of pre|cious &s;tones, oker of all kinds, fine rock-chry&s;tal, Mu&s;covy gla&s;s, talc, alum, &s;altpetre, amber, pit|coal, quick-&s;ilver, &s;par, &s;al-gem, lapis calaminaris, and vitriol.

Some of them have the title of prince, count, or baron, but no &s;uperiority or pre-eminence on that account over the re&s;t, which is only to be obtained by &s;ome public po&s;t or dignity. They have the power of life and death over their va&s;&s;als; pay no taxes; are &s;ubject to none but the king; have a right to all mines and &s;alt-works on their e&s;tates; to all offices and employments, civil, military, and ec|cle&s;ia&s;tic; cannot be cited or tried out of the kingdom; may chu&s;e whom they will for their king, and lay him under what re&s;traints they plea&s;e by the Pacta Conventa; and none but they and the burghers of &s;ome particular towns can pur|cha&s;e lands.

The language in Lithuania differs much from that of the other provinces. True learning and the &s;tudy of the arts and &s;ciences have been little at|tended to in Poland, till of late they began to be regarded with a more favourable eye; and to be not only patronized, but cultivated by &s;everal of the nobles and others, both laymen and eccle&s;ia&s;|tics.</P>

<HEAD>CLERGY and RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>There are two archbi&s;hops in the kingdom, viz. tho&s;e of Gne&s;na and Leopol, and about a dozen bi&s;hops. The archbi&s;hop of Gne&s;na is always a cardinal, and primate of the kingdom, of which, during an interregnum, and in the king's ab&s;ence, he is al&s;o regent. The prevailing religion is po|pery; but there are great numbers of Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, Greeks, who are called Di&s;&s;idents, and by the laws of the kingdom were intitled to tole|ration; but were much oppre&s;&s;ed till very lately, that by the powerful interce&s;&s;ion of the empre&s;s of Ru&s;&s;ia, and the prote&s;tant powers, they have obtained a confirmation of all their religious rights, with additional privileges, under the guaranty of the &s;aid powers. In con&s;equence, however, of the confederacies that have been formed by the male-content party, who oppo&s;ed the elevation of count Poniatow&s;ki to the throne, and the re&s;olutions of the la&s;t diet in regard to the Di&s;&s;idents, the king|dom is now a &s;cene of anarchy, blood&s;hed, and confu&s;ion. The&s;e calamities are, in a great mea|&s;ure, owing to the per&s;ecuting intolerant &s;pirit of the popi&s;h clergy, joined to the bigotry of their blind deluded followers, who plunder and de&s;troy all who are not of their party, e&s;pecially the Di&s;&s;i|dents. The&s;e confederates have al&s;o prevailed up|on the Turks to declare war again&s;t the Ru&s;&s;ians; &s;o that there is no likelihood that the troubles and calamities of this unhappy kingdom will &s;oon be at an end. The Jews are indulged with great privileges, and are very numerous in Poland; and in Lithuania, it is &s;aid, there are a multitude of Mahometan Tartars. We may judge of the num|bers of Jews in this country by the produce of

<HEAD>HISTORY and CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>Poland, like mo&s;t other countries, was origi|nally divided into many &s;mall &s;tates or principali|ties; but &s;ince the year 1309, it has been &s;ubject to one &s;overeign. Mieci&s;laus I. who a&s;cended the throne in the year 964, and was the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable of the Poli&s;h princes at that time, became a convert to chri&s;tianity, and prevailed on many of his &s;ubjects and va&s;&s;als to follow his example. In 1386, Jagello, great duke of Lithuania, em|braced Chri&s;tianity, and afterwards married Hed|wig, queen of Poland, whereby the great duchy was added to the Poli&s;h dominions. The kings of Poland were antiently hereditary and ab&s;olute; but afterwards became elective and limited, as we find them at this day. In the reign of Lewis, towards the end of the fourteenth century, &s;everal limitations were laid on the royal prerogative. In
<PB N="49" REF="510">
that of Ca&s;imir IV. who a&s;cended the throne in 1446, repre&s;entatives from the &s;everal palatinates were fir&s;t called to the diet, the legi&s;lative power, till then, having been lodged in the &s;tates, and the executive in the king and &s;enate. On the de|cea&s;e of Sigi&s;mund Augu&s;tus, it was enacted by law, "That the choice of a king for the future &s;hould perpetually remain free and open to all the nobles of the kingdom;" which law has according|ly been hitherto ob&s;erved. The king, in con&s;e|quence, is elected by the clergy and gentry in the plains of War&s;aw, and after his election is obliged to &s;ign an in&s;trument, by which his power is cir|cum&s;cribed within very narrow bounds; &s;o that he is only a &s;ort of pre&s;ident of the &s;enate, which, in his ab&s;ence, can meet and con&s;ult without him. The diets are either ordinary or extraordinary. The former meet every &s;econd year, the latter upon extraordinary occa&s;ions, when &s;ummoned by the king. They &s;it but &s;ix weeks, and one di&s;&s;ent|ing voice prevents their pa&s;&s;ing any laws, or coming to any re&s;olution on what is propo&s;ed to them from the throne. The &s;enate is compo&s;ed of the primate, the archbi&s;hop of Llemberg, fifteen bi&s;hops, fifteen palatines and ca&s;tellans, and one hundred and thirty laymen, con&s;i&s;ting of the great officers of &s;tate, the palatines, and ca&s;tellans. Be|&s;ides the&s;e officers, who are members of the &s;enate, there are the &s;taro&s;tas, who are a &s;ort of governors and judges of their re&s;pective &s;taro&s;ties or di&s;tricts; but &s;ome of them have no juri&s;diction. The pala|tines and ca&s;tellans, be&s;ides being &s;enators, are al&s;o a &s;ort of lord-lieutenants and deputy-lieutenants in their re&s;pective palatinates. There are not only general diets, but al&s;o provincial diets, or dietines, held previous to the general diets. When the no|bility enter into an a&s;&s;ociation, either during an interregnum, or while the king is living, it is
<PB N="50" REF="520">
called a confederacy. Every third diet is held at Grodno, in Lithuania. Among the king's royal prerogatives the chief is, that he has the di&s;po&s;al of mo&s;t of the dignities, offices, and the royal deme&s;nes: but none of the officers are account|able to him, nor can they be di&s;placed by him.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUE.</HEAD>
<P>The king's revenue, which amounts to about one hundred and forty thou&s;and pounds, is all clear to him&s;elf, for he pays no troops, not even his own guards; but all the forces are paid by the republic, as well as the officers of &s;tate. The public revenues ari&s;e chiefly from the crown-lands, the &s;alt-mines in the palatinate of Cracow, antient tolls and cu&s;toms, particularly tho&s;e of Elbing and Dantzic, the rents of Marienburg, Dir&s;hau, and Rogenhus, and of the government of Cracow and di&s;trict of Niepoliomicz.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ORDER of KNIGHTHOOD.</HEAD>
<P>The order of the White Eagle was in&s;tituted by Augu&s;tus II. in the year 1705. Its en&s;ign is a cro&s;s of gold enamelled with red, and appendant to a blue ribbon. The motto, Profide, rege et lege.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The &s;tanding forces of Poland are divided into the crown-army and that of Lithuania, con&s;i&s;ting of hor&s;e and foot, and amounting to between twenty and thirty thou&s;and men. The&s;e troops are mo&s;tly cantoned on the crown-lands, and in Po|land are paid by a capitation or poll-tax; but in Lithuania other taxes are levied for this purpo&s;e.
<PB N="51" REF="530">
Mo&s;t of the foot are Germans. On any &s;udden and imminent danger, the whole body of the no|bility, with their va&s;&s;als, are obliged to appear in the field on hor&s;eback, and the cities and towns furni&s;h a certain number of foot &s;oldiers, with car|riages, and military flores; but for want of proper arms, provi&s;ions, &s;ubordination, and di&s;|cipline, and by being at liberty after a few weeks to return home, this body has proved but of little advantage to the republic. Dantzic is the only place in the Poli&s;h dominions that de&s;erves the name of a fortre&s;s. Foreign auxiliaries are not to be brought into the kingdom, nor the national troops to march out of it, without the con&s;ent of the &s;tates.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>PERSONS, HABITS, and CHARACTER of the POLES.</HEAD>
<P>The Poles are per&s;onable men, and have good complexions. They are e&s;teemed a brave, hone&s;t people, without di&s;&s;imulation, and exceeding ho&s;|pitable. They cloath them&s;elves in furs in winter, and over all they throw a &s;hort cloak. No people keep grander equipages than the gentry. They look upon them&s;elves as &s;o many &s;overeign princes, have their guards, bands of mu&s;ie, and keep open hou&s;es; but the lower &s;ort of people are poor ab|ject wretches, in the lowe&s;t &s;tate of &s;lavery. The exerci&s;es of the gentry are hunting, riding, dancing, vaulting, &amp;c. They re&s;ide mo&s;tly upon their e&s;tates in the country, and maintain them&s;elves and fa|milies by agriculture, breeding of bees, and grazing.</P>
<P>As to the curio&s;ities and antiquities of Poland, we &s;hall take notice of the principal of them in our de&s;cription of the places in or near which they are found.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="540">
We now proceed to a more particular de&s;crip|tion of Poland and Lithuania.</P>
<P>Both Poland and Lithuania are divided into pro|vinces, and tho&s;e again into palatinates. In our particular de&s;cription therefore we &s;hall give a &s;hort account of the principal places in each pala|tinate of the two grand divi&s;ions, beginning with tho&s;e of Great Poland, which, in a large &s;en&s;e, comprehends Great Poland properly &s;o called, Cu|javia, Ma&s;ovia, and Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia.</P>

It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop &s;uffragan of Gne&s;na, and is defended by a double wall, a deep moat, and a ca&s;tle, which &s;tands on an i&s;land in the Warta. The principal &s;tructures are the cathedral and other churches, the convents, the bi&s;hop's palace, the academy, or gymna&s;ium, the Je&s;uits-college and town-hou&s;e. The &s;uburbs are pretty large. There are three great fairs kept in this city much re&s;ort|ed to by the German traders. Mo&s;t of the inha|bitants are papi&s;ts, intermingled with a con&s;ide|rable number of Jews, who have great privileges here as well as in the re&s;t of Poland.

<HEAD>POLISH PRUSSIA.</HEAD>
<P>Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia, commonly called Royal Pru&s;|&s;ia, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, which is now a kingdom belonging to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and of which we have already given an account, was formerly a di&s;tinct political &s;tate, having no other connexion with Poland, except that of a perpetual alliance, and of being under the &s;ame &s;overeign; for when the inhabitants put them&s;elves under the protection of Ca&s;&s;imir IV. in 1466, it was expre&s;ly &s;tipulated that Pru&s;&s;ia &s;hould have nothing to do with the republic of Poland:
<PB N="59" REF="610">
but that the king &s;hould alone, and per&s;onally, or|der and determine all matters relating to the for|mer; and to that end &s;hould often come among them and hold general diets. This political con&s;titution hath &s;ince undergone great altera|tions, and, excepting &s;ome few particular rights and privileges, Pru&s;&s;ia is on much the &s;ame footing as the other provinces, which are all a &s;ort of di&s;|tinct &s;tates, having power to make laws, which, however, mu&s;t not be contrary to the general laws of the republic, enacted by the diet, or ge|neral a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates. Dantzic and &s;ome other towns of Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia have particular pri|vileges, and are governed by their re&s;pective ma|gi&s;trates. Pru&s;&s;ia is upwards of fifty miles in length; but its breadth varies from forty-eight to eighteen. It is bounded by Pomerania, Poland, Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, and the Vi&s;tula. The &s;outh part, except about Dantzic, is barren, tho' level and open; but the re&s;t is over-run with mountains, lakes, and woods: the lakes yield plenty of fi&s;h; and the woods, honey and wax, game, wild boars, and roe-bucks. There are al&s;o &s;ome heaths in it of great extent. The inhabitants are a mixture of Poles and Germans. With re&s;pect to religion, the prote&s;tants were, and &s;till are, very numerous here, tho' no pains have been &s;pared to make them con|verts to popery, either by per&s;ecution and oppre&s;|&s;ion, or more gentle and alluring methods. The deputies of Pru&s;&s;ia a&s;&s;i&s;t at the election of the king of Poland, who, after his coronation, takes an oath to maintain the people in their rights and pri|vileges. The king can determine nothing of mo|ment without the concurrence of the &s;tates, or the &s;enate, which is compo&s;ed of the bi&s;hops of Erm|land and Culm, the three palatines of Culm, Ma|rienburg, and Pomerellia, and their re&s;pective ca&s;|tellans, three vice-trea&s;urers, who repre&s;ent the nobility, and two coun&s;ellors from the cities

of Thorn, Elbing, and Dantzic, who are nomi|nated by the king. The bi&s;hops, palatines, and ca&s;tellans, are al&s;o members of the &s;enate of Po|land, to the general diets of which the nobility and the three large towns &s;end deputies. For|merly, indeed, the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;enate and diets had no connection with the Poli&s;h: but in 1569, a part of the &s;enate of Pru&s;&s;ia was admitted into that of Poland, and the &s;tates of the former were com|pelled to appear at the general diet of the king|dom. When a general Pru&s;&s;ian diet is &s;ummoned, it is held alternately at Marienburg and Graudenz, and previous to it, provincial diets are held in every palatinate. The cities and towns pay two &s;hillings for every bu&s;hel of malt which they brew, and every hide of land in the country is rated at a Poli&s;h guilder: other taxes are &s;ome|times impo&s;ed. The Pru&s;&s;ians are not obliged to go upon any military expedition out of the pro|vince, and the burghers of Thorn have the privi|lege of purcha&s;ing lands. The three principal cities have the privilege of coining gold and &s;ilver pieces of various &s;orts, having the king's head on one &s;ide, and their re&s;pective arms on the rever&s;e. The tribunal at Peterkau is the la&s;t re&s;ort for the nobility; but appeals lie from the magi&s;trates of the three great towns above-mentioned to the royal a&s;&s;e&s;&s;orial court. The towns in Pru&s;&s;ia are divided into great and &s;mall: the great are Dantzic, Thorn, and Elbing; the &s;mall compre|hend all the re&s;t, except &s;uch as belong to the two bi&s;hops.

<P>This palatinate had antiently princes of its own; afterwards it belonged to the princes of Great Po|land; then to the knights of the Teutonic order; and, at la&s;t, in the year 1466, it fell under the dominion of the republic of Poland. It has a pa|latine and four provincial judges, lies mo&s;tly in the dioce&s;e of Cujavia, and contains five circles and &s;taro&s;ties. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable places in it are</P>

It is hard|ly credible how often this city has changed ma&s;ters in the competitions for the crown of Poland, and on other occa&s;ions, and what &s;ums have been ex|torted from it. It is large, populous, and rich, and carries on a va&s;t trade, being the chief mart and magazine of Poland, and one of the greate&s;t granaries in the world; &s;o that whole fleets of &s;hips come hither every year to load with corn alone. It con&s;i&s;ts of the old and new town, with their &s;uburbs, has a fine harbour, a great number of &s;hips, and many valuable privileges. Among the la&s;t are tho&s;e of coining money, gathering am|ber, and &s;ending repre&s;entatives to the general diets of Poland and the Pru&s;&s;ian &s;enate. It is well fortified; but being commanded by two hills on the &s;outh-we&s;t, it cannot &s;tand a long &s;iege. Among the public buildings, St. Mary's church, the town-hou&s;e, the ar&s;enal, the exchange, the &s;quare of St. Dominic, the Je&s;uits college, and the granaries, are the chief. It is computed that three hundred and &s;ixty-five thou&s;and la&s;ts of Po|li&s;h

wheat are &s;hipped from hence one year with another. Hither Poland &s;ends its commodities for exportation, and from hence is chiefly &s;upplied with tho&s;e of other countries. Among the latter are great quantities of herrings, both Scotch and Dutch. The exports and imports con&s;i&s;t of a variety of articles, and furni&s;h a va&s;t deal of bu&s;ine&s;s and wealth to the city. One half of the port|cu&s;toms belongs to the king. But tho' the town be under the protection of Poland, it is governed by its own magi&s;trates in form of a republic. The&s;e magi&s;trates determine all criminal cau&s;es without appeal, and all civil cau&s;es not exceeding one thou&s;and livres. The inhabitants, who are com|puted at two hundred thou&s;and, are mo&s;tly Ger|mans and Lutherans, with a mixture of Calvini&s;ts and papi&s;ts. The city maintains a con&s;tant garri|&s;on of two hundred &s;oldiers. One of the &s;uburbs is called Scotland; and the Scots have great pri|vileges, in con&s;ideration of their gallant defence of the town under one of the family of Douglas, when it was be&s;ieged by the Poles. It is &s;aid there are upwards of thirty thou&s;and pedlars of that nation in Poland, who travel &s;ome on foot, and &s;ome with three, four, or five hor&s;es. In king Charles II's time, they were about fifty-three thou&s;and: in that reign, Sir John Denham and Mr. Killigrew were &s;ent to take the number of them, and to tax them by the poll, with the king of Poland's licence, which having obtained, they brought home ten thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, be&s;ides their charges in the journey. Here is a Lutheran college, with &s;even profe&s;&s;ors, and one teacher of the Poli&s;h language. The library belonging to the city is &s;aid to be a very good one. One of the mills on the Radaune, a &s;mall river that runs through the city, formerly yielded four thou&s;and three hundred pounds per annum to the &s;tate, be&s;ides what it

It is &s;aid to be the hand&s;ome&s;t and be&s;t built town in all Pru&s;&s;ia, the &s;treets being much broader, and the hou&s;es &s;tatelier than at Dantzic. Its name is &s;up|po&s;ed to be derived from the German word Thor, &s;ignifying a door or gate, becau&s;e the Teutonic knights, by building it, opened to them&s;elves a door into Pru&s;&s;ia. This &s;uppo&s;ition &s;eems the more probable from the device on the city &s;eal, which is a gate thrown open. In the year 1454 this city, in conjunction with the re&s;t of Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia, threw off the oppre&s;&s;ive yoke of the Teutonic knights, and put it&s;elf under the pro|tection of Poland, on condition, that it &s;hould enjoy its antient rights and privileges, which are &s;till equal, and even &s;uperior to tho&s;e of Dantzic. In particular, it has the right of coining money, of chu&s;ing its magi&s;trates, of determining both

civil and criminal cau&s;es, the la&s;t without appeal, of &s;ending repre&s;entatives to the general diets, and of purcha&s;ing fiefs and e&s;tates, which la&s;t pri|vilege otherwi&s;e belongs to the nobility alone, and many others. Notwith&s;tanding, it is now greatly declined from its former pro&s;perity, and its trade is at a low ebb. The German and Poli&s;h languages are &s;aid to be &s;poken here in the greate&s;t purity. The territory of the city is of con&s;iderable extent. At a village about &s;ix miles from the city, all per&s;ons who come to it may drink as much beer as they plea&s;e, gratis. The town is defended by a double wall and moats. The wooden-bridge over the Vi&s;tula here is &s;aid to be the longe&s;t and the mo&s;t expen&s;ive in Europe, half an hour being required to walk from one end of it to the other, and one third of it being every year carried off by the rapidity of the current and the &s;hoals of ice; for the piles being driven into a quick-&s;and, it is not capable of re&s;i&s;ting any violent &s;hock. It con|&s;i&s;ts properly of two bridges, the i&s;land Bazar di|viding it in the middle. The &s;tadthou&s;e is reckon|ed the &s;tatelie&s;t in Europe next to that of Am|&s;terdam. Great quantities of &s;oap and ginger|bread are made here and exported. The a&s;para|gus that grows wild hereabouts, is not inferior to that which is cultivated el&s;ewhere. The famous a&s;tronomer Copernicus was born here in 1472, and died in 1543 at Frauenburg. The town-gar|ri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of only one company. The Luthe|ran college has five profe&s;&s;ors, with a teacher of the Poli&s;h language, a fine library, and printing|hou&s;e.

The number of the religious hou&s;es in the town and &s;uburbs are very great. In the neigh|bourhood are &s;alt-mines, which yield a great re|venue, and contain &s;alt of four different &s;orts. Near the town al&s;o on the Vi&s;tula &s;tands the Bene|dictine convent of Tineeck, one of the chief in Poland; for to it belong five towns, and one hun|dred villages.

<HEAD>LITHUANIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS exten&s;ive country was united to the republic of Poland in the year 1501.

Its length is &s;aid to be about three hundred and &s;ixty, and its breadth three hundred
<PB N="77" REF="800">
and forty miles; but it is much indented both ways. Lithuania was antiently over-run with wood, and there are &s;till many fore&s;ts in it, which yield a great deal of honey, wax, pitch, tar, and timber; and abound with wild boars, buffaloes, elks, wild hor&s;es, wild a&s;&s;es, uri, and woodcocks. The lakes al&s;o are numerous and well &s;tored with fi&s;h: but the air, by rea&s;on of the&s;e fore&s;ts and lakes, is &s;aid to be thick and foggy. The country produces a great deal of buck-wheat and other corn, the pa&s;tures are luxuriant, and the flocks and herds numerous: &s;o that, nothwith&s;tanding agriculture is much neglected, provi&s;ions are exceeding cheap, but money &s;o &s;carce, that ten per cent is the com|mon intere&s;t. The principal nobility have large e&s;tates, and live in great pomp and &s;plendor, ge|nerally retaining &s;ome hundreds of tho&s;e that are poor, in quality of dome&s;tics. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion is popery; but Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, Jews, Turks, Greeks, and Socinians are very humerous. Lithuania was governed by its own dukes till it was united to Poland, towards the end of the fourteenth century, when the great duke Jagello married Hedwig, the dowager of Lewis, king of Poland and Hungary. It had even dukes after that, but they were &s;ubordinate to the king; and at this day, though one diet &s;erves for both countries, yet each has its peculiar laws, cu&s;toms, dialect, and privileges. In a diet held at Lublin in 1569, it was more clo&s;ely united to Poland than it had been before, and it was enacted, that both countries, for the future, &s;hould form but one &s;tate under the &s;ame prince. As to their courts of ju&s;tice, the tenth part of what is ad|judged in all real actions goes always to the judge's box, and is immediately paid in court; and inper|&s;onal actions he claims half the damages given. A no|bleman is only fined for murder, as in Poland. The
<PB N="78" REF="810">
common people here, excepting the burghers in the royal towns, and the Germans, are &s;laves, and, in many places, the ignorant vulgar &s;till retain &s;ome remains of idolatry. The poor people have only Mondays to them&s;elves; and if their lords have occa&s;ion for them even on that day, the pea&s;ant mu&s;t work for him&s;elf on Sunday. If any of them is condemned to death by his lord, he mu&s;t execute him&s;elf, or &s;uffer greater cruelty. The dialect is a language of the Sclavonic, and they &s;peak here, as in Poland, a barbarous kind of Latin. Lithua|nia is divided into nine palatinates. Another di|vi&s;ion is into Lithuania, properly &s;o called, and Li|thuanian Ru&s;&s;ia. Some al&s;o comprehend under it Samogitia and Courland, which is a fief of Po|land.</P>
<P>Lithuania, properly &s;o called, contains the pa|latinates of Wilno and Trockie. In that of Wil|no the principal places are</P>
<P>Wilno, or Vina, which gives name to it, and is the capital both of it and the great dutchy. It is very large, and &s;tands &s;eventy miles from Grod|no, one hundred from Mittaw, one hundred and fifty-two from Koning&s;berg, one hundred and thirty-one from Riga, two hundred and &s;eventeen from War&s;aw, and two hundred and thirty-five from Dantzic. Here is a ca&s;tle, a ruinous royal palace, an ar&s;enal, and upwards of thirty popi&s;h churches, be&s;ides a Greek, a Lutheran, a Calvi|ni&s;t, and a Tartarean church, with a Jewi&s;h &s;yna|gogue. A dreadful fire happened here in 1748, destroying a great part of the town, &s;ince which it has not yet recovered its former grandeur. This and other fires would not have been &s;o fatal, if a great part of the city had not been built of wood, as is the ca&s;e of mo&s;t towns both in Poland and Li|thuania. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and has a Je|&s;uits college, in which the &s;ciences are taught by
<PB N="79" REF="820">
&s;everal profe&s;&s;ors. A high-court of judicature, a provincial diet, and court of ju&s;tice, are held in this city. The magi&s;trates are ennobled by their office, &s;o that their children can purcha&s;e e&s;tates. The inhabitants are a mixture of Poles, Ru&s;&s;ians, Germans, Tartars, Lithuanians, Jews, Turks, and other nations. The &s;uburbs are as big as the town, and full of the like timber cottages, con&s;i&s;t|ing of one room, common to the family and their cattle. The trade of the place is chiefly carried on by foreigners. The hou&s;es of the poor people are &s;o &s;moaky, and they eat &s;o much garlic and onions, that half of them are blind before they grow old. If a foreigner is murdered by a native, the latter, it is &s;aid, pays only a fine. The lon|gitude of this city is 25&deg;.38&prime;. ea&s;t, and the lati|tude 54&deg;.46&prime;. north.</P>

<P>IS a duchy which antiently belonged to Lithua|nia. There are a great many mountains, woods,

lakes, and rivers in it. The woods &s;warm with bees, and there are &s;ome good corn and pa&s;ture lands in the duchy; which al&s;o gives title to a bi&s;hop, and has an upper &s;taro&s;ta, or palatine, and a ca&s;tellan. It contains a great many &s;mall towns, but none of them worth mentioning, except Wor|nic, or Miedniki, where the bi&s;hop re&s;ides; and Ro&s;enie on the river Dubi&s;ta, where the provin|cial diet and court of judicature are held. The pea|&s;ants are &s;aid to be very rude and boori&s;h; and in the de&s;erts to be &s;till &s;trangers to Chri&s;tianity, and little better than &s;avages. In&s;tead of bread, it is &s;aid, they u&s;e green turnips, which grow wild with|out &s;owing.

<P>THIS duchy, which by the natives is called Kur, or Cur-&s;emme, i. e. a trace of land pro|jecting into the &s;ea, is bounded on the &s;outh by Sa|mogitia; on the north by the gulph of Riga and Livonia; on the we&s;t by the Baltic; and on the ea&s;t by Lithuania, properly &s;o called. It is about two hundred miles in length; but the breadth is very unequal, being in &s;ome places eighty, in others forty, and in others &s;till le&s;s. As to the &s;oil, a great part of the country con&s;i&s;ts of woods and &s;wamps; but when drained, it is very fruitful, yielding plenty of grain, flax, and pa&s;ture. It is al&s;o well &s;upplied with fi&s;h, iron-ore, minerals, quarries of &s;tone, chalk, &s;tucco, timber, and mi|neral &s;prings. Here al&s;o, on the coa&s;t of the Baltic, amber is found. What the inhabitants can &s;pare
<PB N="84" REF="870">
of the&s;e and other commodities are carried to Riga, Libau, Windaw, and Memel, to be tran&s;ported beyond &s;ea. They have cattle and hor&s;es in abund|ance, and one of their methods of hu&s;bandry is to let the water remain upon a piece of low ground for two or three years, and then to drain it, when it is become &s;o &s;oft and fat, that it requires but an ea&s;y plowing, and bears good crops for three years after which it is again laid under water. With regard to religion, the two principal &s;ects are the Lutherans and Papi&s;ts; the others are Calvini&s;ts Greeks, and Jews, who are al&s;o tolerated, but ex|cluded from all public employments: as to Arians Socinians, Arminians, and Anabapti&s;ts, they are not allowed to &s;ettle in the duchy. The inhabi|tants are mo&s;tly compo&s;ed of Germans and Lat|tonians, or Livonians, the latter being a &s;ort o$ &s;laves to the former. The nobility have great pri|vileges, e&s;pecially the old; for they are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into the old and new, of which the former only are capable of the employments of the &s;tate but neither have a &s;eat in the diets of Poland. They have an unlimited power over their wretched va&s;|&s;als, which extends even to life and death. The duke is patron of &s;ome of the churches, and the nobility of others. When the defence of the country requires it, the nobility are obliged to ap|pear on hor&s;eback under the duke, but not to march beyond the frontiers. They are extremely jealous of and watchful over their privileges Courland being a fief of Poland, when a new king of that country is elected, he is obliged to &s;end an envoy for inve&s;titure. He has all the regalia allowed to &s;overeign princes of Germany; coins money in his own name, and has &s;overeign juri&s;diction; but in &s;ome extraordinary ca&s;es, the nobility may ap|peal to the court of Poland. He keeps a court with all the &s;tate officers as other princes, and with
<PB N="85" REF="880">
his nobility is able to rai&s;e eighteen thou&s;and men. He &s;ummons a diet of the &s;tates as-often as occa&s;ion requires; upon which they elect deputies, and &s;end them in&s;tructions to the diet at Mittaw. In 1558, Ketler, the la&s;t great ma&s;ter of the Teutonic knights in Livonia, was made hereditary duke of Courland by the king of Poland, on con|dition of his quitting Riga and Livonia, and hold|ing the duchy in fee of that crown. His de&s;cend|ants continued in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it till 1737, when Ferdinand, the la&s;t of that family dying, Courland cho&s;e the count Erne&s;t Biron, a native, and cham|berlain to her czari&s;h maje&s;ty Anne Iwanowna, who was afterwards inve&s;ted by the king of Poland; but in 1740 he was bani&s;hed with all his family to Sibe|ria, where he continued till lately, when he was re|&s;tored by the pre&s;ent czarina. During the bani&s;h|ment of the duke, the revenues, which ari&s;e chiefly from deme&s;nes, were entirely in the hands of the Ru&s;&s;ians. The&s;e deme&s;nes are &s;o large, that it is &s;aid they make above a third part of the whole duchy; &s;o that the duke, if he is di&s;po&s;ed, may ama&s;s great wealth, or keep a very hand&s;ome court. The ordinary judges here are the four cap|tains, &s;uperintendents, or bailiffs, two for Courland, and two for Semigallia. From the&s;e an appeal lies to the high council, in which the duke &s;its in per&s;on; and from thence, if the &s;um conte&s;ted is above &s;ix hundred florins, to the king of Poland. The criminal cau&s;es of the nobility are al&s;o tried by the high-council; but an appeal to the king in &s;ome ca&s;es lies al&s;o in regard to the&s;e. Di&s;putes be|tween the duke and the nobility are decided only by the king in per&s;on. The towns are generally under the juri&s;diction of their own magi&s;trates. Every two years a diet is held at Mittaw, to which every pari&s;h &s;ends repre&s;entatives. The duchy is divided into three parts, viz. Courland, properly
<PB N="86" REF="890">
&s;o called, Semigallia, and the di&s;trict of Pilten. In the fir&s;t of the&s;e the principal places are</P>
<P>Goldingen, a &s;mall town, with a ca&s;tle on the river Windaw, in which the dukes &s;ometimes re&s;ide. Near it is an iron-work and copper flatting mill.</P>
<P>Windaw, a con&s;iderable town with a good har|bour at the mouth of a river of the &s;ame name, a hundred and ten miles we&s;t of Mittaw, has &s;ome trade in pitch, tar, wax, &amp;c. but is much declined from its former pro&s;perity, when the Li|vonian grand-ma&s;ter re&s;ided, and the &s;tates of Cour|land a&s;&s;embled here.</P>
<P>Libau, a timber-built town, forty-two miles north of Memel. It has a good road and harbour, and the greate&s;t trade of any place in the country. Here the duke's &s;hips are u&s;ually built, and a court of admiralty held. In the neighbourhood is a fre&s;h|water lake. Here it is &s;aid above an hundred and fifty &s;hips in a year load with hemp, lin&s;eed, and naval &s;tores.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>SECOND DIVISION, or SEMIGALLIA.</HEAD>
<P>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable places are Mittau, the capital of the whole duchy, the &s;eat of its diets, and the re&s;idence of the duke. It &s;tands on the river Aa, thirty-two miles &s;outh of Riga, and above two hundred and ninety north of War&s;aw. It is pretty large; but neither well built, fortified, nor inhabited. Here a magnificent palace was be|gun by duke Erne&s;t John; but upon his bani&s;h|ment the building was di&s;continued, which, it is probable, hath been re&s;umed &s;ince he recovered his liberty. Under it, in a vault, are depo&s;ited the remains of many of the dukes in coffins of fine copper, curiou&s;ly decorated. In the town are ma|ny gardens and open places, together with two Lu|theran,

one Calvini&s;t, and one popi&s;h church. The longitude of it is 25&deg; 23&prime; ea&s;t, and the latitude 56&deg; 26&prime; north.</P>
<P>Scelburg, a &s;mall town and ca&s;tle on the river Duina, which was the &s;ee of the bi&s;hop of Semi|migallia, before the archbi&s;hopric of Riga was founded.</P>

<P>There is another &s;mall town called Ha&s;en|poth, and a promontory called Dome&s;ne&s;s, on which are two beacons, wherein a large fire is kept burning all night, from the fir&s;t of Augu&s;t to the fir&s;t of January.

<HEAD>TURKEY in EUROPE.</HEAD>
<P>THE Turks are of a Scythian or Tartarian original, having been antiently &s;eated be|twixt the Black and Ca&s;pian &s;eas. The ap|pellation of Turk, which &s;ignifies &s;ublime and pre-eminent, was fir&s;t given them in the mid|dle ages as a proper name. They were little known till the eighth century, when they made inroads up|on Georgia, and plundered that country. In the year 844, they penetrated as far as Armenia Major, where they fixed them&s;elves, and from them that country obtained the name of Turcomania. About the year 1000, the &s;ultan of Per&s;ia, who at that time was hard pre&s;&s;ed by the caliph of Babylon on one &s;ide, and the Indians on the other, invited them into his &s;ervice, and, by their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, en|tirely defeated his enemies: but Tangrolipix, who commanded the Turks, not having been re|warded, as he expected, there aro&s;e &s;uch a mi&s;un|der&s;tanding between the&s;e new allies, that it occa|&s;ioned

a war, wherein Tangrolipix defeated Ma|homet, the Per&s;ian &s;ultan, killed him in the field, and thereby became &s;ultan of Per&s;ia. The Turks, when they came into Per&s;ia, were Pagans; but by conver&s;ing &s;o long with the Saracens, many of them were now become Mahometans; and Tan|grolipix, upon his acce&s;&s;ion to the Per&s;ian throne, profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf a Mahometan, probably to en|gage his new &s;ubjects the more readily to &s;ubmit to his government. He afterwards marched a|gain&s;t the caliph of Babylon, whom he defeated: but attempting the conque&s;t of Arabia, he did not meet with the like &s;ucce&s;s; whereupon he turned his arms towards Natolia or the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, and made a con&s;iderable progre&s;s in the conque&s;t of that county. Another &s;warm or hord of Tartars breaking into Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, under &s;hah Solyman, di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the former of a great part of it. Otho|man grand&s;on of Solomon, from whom the Turki&s;h empire derives the name of Othoman, added greatly to the conque&s;ts of his grandfather, and fir&s;t took the title of emperor. From him the pre&s;ent grand &s;ignior deduces his pedigree. His &s;ucce&s;&s;ors, with a few checks and interruptions, continued conquering, till they extended the empire to its pre&s;ent limits.</P>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Of the CONSTITUTION and GOVERNMENT of the Turki&s;h EMPIRE, and the SERAGLIO.</HEAD>
<P>The grand &s;ignior, or emperor of the Turks, is re|&s;trained by no laws or compacts, the government being purely monarchical: but if the emperor indul|ges not the humours of the people, and e&s;pecially of the mutinous Janizaries, he is in danger not only of being depo&s;ed, but al&s;o of being put to death. Tho&s;e who have offices under the govern|ment he &s;queezes, di&s;graces, and puts to death, upon the lea&s;t &s;ugge&s;tion of their di&s;affection, or
<PB N="90" REF="940">
mi&s;conduct, without giving them an opportunity of an&s;wering for them&s;elves, they being looked upon as more immediately his &s;laves: but others &s;eem to enjoy almo&s;t as great a degree of &s;ecurity both in their per&s;ons and properties, as the &s;ubjects of other ab&s;olute monarchies. Indeed in all &s;uch there is a gradation of governors and officers, of which the higher fleece and oppre&s;s tho&s;e below them, and the lowe&s;t make repri&s;als upon the common people. In the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the empire, no regard is paid to age or birth-right, the Turks thinking it &s;ufficient, if in their elections, they keep to the Othoman family. Women are excluded from the throne. The emperors council is either ordinary or extraordinary. The fir&s;t, meeting every Sunday and Thur&s;day, con&s;i&s;ts of the great officers of &s;tate, and is called the Galibe Divani. To the other, which is called Ajack Divani, are &s;ummon|ed all the great per&s;ons and officers of the empire, and even the olde&s;t and mo&s;t experienced &s;oldiers. The &s;ultan hears what pa&s;&s;es from an adjoining chamber. At the head of the mini&s;try is the grand vizir, who is, as it were, his lieutenant-ge|neral, with whom he divides, or rather to whom he leaves the care of the whole empire, he being entru&s;ted not only with the finances, with foreign affairs, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in civil and criminal matters, but al&s;o with the conduct of the war, and the command of the armies. Great and dangerous as this charge is, there have been men who have executed it with &s;afety and &s;ucce&s;s, both in peace and war, and have died quietly in their beds; but that is not the ca&s;e with mo&s;t of them, it being the u&s;ual policy of the emperors to &s;helter them&s;elves from the clamours of the people, by throwing the whole blame of any male-admini&s;tration upon him, and giving him up to the public re&s;entment. His income, without
<PB N="91" REF="950">
any breach of probity, may amount to 600,000 dollars, exclu&s;ive of pre&s;ents and other perqui&s;ites. Notwith&s;tanding his high dignity, his palace is open to every one, and he gives audience to the meane&s;t of the poor. When the &s;ultan names a grand vizir, he puts into his hand the &s;eal of the empire, and when he honours him with the com|mand of an army, he takes out one of the plumes of his own turban at the head of the troops, and delivers it to him, to place it in his own. The other great officers of &s;tate are the kaimakan, or vizir's deputy, not to be confounded with the governor of Con&s;tantinople, who is al&s;o called kaimakan; the vizirs of the bench, or ba&s;&s;as of three hor&s;e-tails, becau&s;e three hor&s;e-tails are car|ried before them when they march, and who &s;it in the divan or courts of ju&s;tice with him; the kadinla&s;quiers, or chief ju&s;tices of provinces; the beiglerbegs, or viceroys, of which the chief are tho&s;e of Romelia, Natolia, and Dama&s;cus; the ordinary ba&s;&s;as, or governors of towns and di&s;tricts under the beiglerbegs; the reis effendi, or lord chancellor and &s;ecretary of &s;tate; the tef|terder or high trea&s;urer; the aga of the Janizaries; the aga of the Spahis; the aga of the Siluds, &amp;c. The chief officers of the &s;eraglio are the ki&s;lar|aga&s;i, who is &s;uperintendant of the women, and has the command of all the black eunuchs; the capi aga, who has the command of all the white eunuchs, and to whom all petitions to be pre&s;ented to the prince are delivered. Both the&s;e are al&s;o eunuchs, and of the &s;ame complexion as tho&s;e of whom they have the command. Be&s;ides the wo|men and eunuchs, there are in the &s;eraglio the ichoglans and azamoglans, mutes, dwarfs, and buffoons. The ichoglans are young men bred up in the &s;eraglio, not only to &s;erve about the prince, but to fill in time the fir&s;t po&s;ts of the empire.
<PB N="92" REF="960">
The azamoglans are trained up there for inferior employments.</P>
<P>No children are admitted into the &s;eraglios of Con&s;tantinople, Pera, or Adrianople, till they are fir&s;t reviewed and approved of by the grand &s;ignior. They are generally the mo&s;t beautiful, well made, and &s;prightly, that can be met with. They are fir&s;t taught, after being circumci&s;ed, &s;ilence and a mode&s;t humble behaviour. Then they are in&s;truct|ed in the Mohammedan religion, to &s;peak and write the Turki&s;h language, and afterwards the Per&s;ian and Arabic. As they grow up, they are taught manly exerci&s;es, and whatever is thought requi&s;ite to qualify them for &s;tate-employments: but they are &s;eldom preferred out of the &s;eraglio until the age of forty.</P>
<P>The ladies of the haram are a collection of young beautiful virgins, either the pre&s;ents of go|vernors, purcha&s;ed, or captives taken in war; mo&s;t of them being the children of chri&s;tian parents. They are taught mu&s;ic, dancing, and other accompli&s;h|ments, and furni&s;hed with the riche&s;t cloaths and ornaments. Some of them frequently play and dance before the grand &s;ignior, while others divert him with their conver&s;ation. They have a great many female &s;laves to wait on them, but are &s;carce ever &s;uffered to go abroad, except when the grand &s;ignior changes his place of re&s;idence; when a troop of black eunuchs convey them to the boats, which are enclo&s;ed with lattices: and when they go by land, they are put into clo&s;e chariots, and &s;ignals made at certain di&s;tances, to give notice, that none may ap|proach the road through which they are to pa&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>Of the Per&s;ons, HABITS, CUSTOMS, TEMPER, and GENIUS of the TURKS.</HEAD>
<P>The Turks are generally robu&s;t and well|&s;haped, of a good mien, and patient of hard|&s;hips,
<PB N="93" REF="970">
which render them fit for war. They &s;have their heads, but wear their beards long, except the military, and tho&s;e in the &s;eraglio, who wear only whi&s;kers. They cover their heads with a white linen turban of an enormous &s;ize, and never pull it off but when they &s;leep. None but Turks mu&s;t pre&s;ume to wear a white turban. Their breeches, or drawers, are of a piece with their &s;tockings; and they have &s;lippers in&s;tead of &s;hoes, which they pull off when they enter a temple or hou&s;e. They wear &s;hirts, with wide &s;leeves, not gathered at the wri&s;ts, and over them a ve&s;t tied with a &s;a&s;h; their upper garment being a loo&s;e gown, &s;omething &s;horter than the ve&s;t.</P>
<P>The women's dre&s;s pretty much re&s;embles that of the men, only they have a &s;tiffened cap with horns, &s;omething like a mitre, on their heads, in|&s;tead of a turban, and wear their hair flowing down. When they go abroad, they are &s;o wrapped up, that their faces cannot be &s;een.</P>
<P>The Turks &s;it, eat, and &s;leep, according to the cu&s;tom of the Ea&s;t, on &s;ophas or cu&s;hions, mattra&s;|&s;es, and carpets. Rice is their mo&s;t general food, and coffee their common drink. Their mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;alutation is to bow the head a little, laying the right hand on their brea&s;ts; but to per&s;ons of rank, they &s;toop &s;o low as to touch the border of their ve&s;t. The women are kept under a rigorous confine|ment. They have generally delicate &s;kins, regular features, black hair and eyes, with an admirable che&s;t. Many of them are complete beauties. Their cleanline&s;s is extraordinary; for they bathe twice a week, and &s;uffer not the &s;malle&s;t hair, or the lea&s;t &s;oil, to be upon their bodies. As to the qualities of their minds, they are &s;aid to want neither wit, vivacity, nor tenderne&s;s; and to be exceeding amo|rous. It is no doubt for this rea&s;on, that the men
<PB N="94" REF="980">
never &s;uffer their wives faces to be &s;een, not even by the deare&s;t friend they have in the world.</P>
<P>There is no need of much wit to behave one's &s;elf well here; for a good mien and gravity &s;upply the place of merit in the Ea&s;t, and much gaiety would &s;poil all. Not that the Turks want wit; but they &s;peak little, and pride them&s;elves in &s;incerity and mode&s;ty more than eloquence. The Turks u&s;e no unnece&s;|&s;ary words, whereas the Greeks talk ince&s;&s;antly. Though the&s;e two nations are born under one cli|mate, their tempers are more different than if they lived in the mo&s;t di&s;tant countries. The Turks make profe&s;&s;ion of candour and faithfulne&s;s, and are a charitable good-natured people, jealou&s;y ex|cepted, and very &s;ober. On the other hand, they are extremely proud, in&s;olent, indolent, &s;uper&s;titious, and covetous. They are al&s;o much addicted to un|natural lu&s;ts; and de&s;pi&s;e all other nations in gene|ral, e&s;pecially tho&s;e which are not of their religion. The common appellation that they give chri&s;tians is that of dogs. An uniformity runs through all the actions of the Turks, and they never change their manner of living. They &s;eem to have no kind of genius for the improvement of the arts and &s;ciences, though they live under the influence of the &s;ame heaven, and po&s;&s;e&s;s the &s;ame countries as the antient Grecians did. They generally loiter away their time, either among the women in the haram, or in &s;moaking, or taking opium; and though they herd together, you will ob&s;erve as little conver&s;ation among them as among&s;t &s;o many hor&s;es in a &s;table. They &s;eldom travel, or u&s;e any exerci&s;e or rural &s;ports; and di&s;cover little or no curio&s;ity to be informed of the &s;tate of their own, or any other country: but Turkey, after all, is not without men of parts, probity, and honour; nor benevolent, liberal, conver&s;ible, and ingenious people. They behave very commendably to their
<PB N="95" REF="990">
&s;laves and &s;ervants, and frequently better than the Chri&s;tians do to theirs. There are no hereditary governments, or titles of nobility in Turkey; and indeed the commonalty there enjoy the greate&s;t liberty.</P>

<HEAD>LANGUAGE and LEARNING of the TURKS.</HEAD>
<P>The languages &s;poken in Turkey in Europe are the Turki&s;h and Tartarian, which have a great affinity to one another; the modern Greek, which differs widely from the antient; the Sclavonian, and Walachian. The Arabic is the language of the learned. Learning is at a very low ebb among the Turks: however, they have &s;ome &s;chools, col|leges, and academies; but they are on a very dif|ferent footing from tho&s;e among us. Not many years &s;ince, a printing hou&s;e was &s;et up at Con&s;tan|tinople, where books of all kinds were allowed to be printed, except on matters of religion. The mo&s;t ingenious mu&s;&s;elmen employ them&s;elves in reading the Alcoran and the commentators upon it, to which almo&s;t all their learning is confined. Some of them amu&s;e them&s;elves with poetry, in which they are &s;aid to &s;ucceed very well. Others Turks delight in mu&s;ic, and &s;pend the whole day in playing upon an in&s;trument, without being tired, though they only repeat the &s;ame tune. It is &s;aid, there are a great many manu&s;cripts in the Turki&s;h, Arabian, and Per&s;ian languages, among the Turks; but it is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that they contain any very deep, &s;olid, ingenious, or u&s;eful learning.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Their FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The Turki&s;h regular troops are the Spahis and Timar-&s;pahis, who are light hor&s;e. The latter, who have e&s;tates in land a&s;&s;igned them, in&s;tead
<PB N="96" REF="1000">
of pay, are obliged to bring a certain number of &s;laves into the field with them. The tributary princes of Moldavia and Walachia, and the Crim Tartars, are al&s;o obliged to &s;end auxiliaries. But the flower of the Turki&s;h army con&s;i&s;ts of the Janizaries, who amount to about forty thou&s;and, and are all infantry. They have particular pri|vileges, being &s;ubject to no juri&s;diction but that of their aga, or commander. Their pay is three a&s;pers a day, be&s;ides victuals, and a &s;uit of cloaths every year. They are all lodged at Con&s;tantinople together in a &s;ort of barracks, having been educated in the &s;eraglio, and trained up to the exerci&s;e of arms from their infancy. Be&s;ides the Janizaries, there is another body of foot, called Capis. The whole Turki&s;h army, regulars and irregulars, amounts to above three hundred thou&s;and men. Be&s;ides the true Janizaries, or Janizaries of the Porte, and in actual pay, there are great numbers all over the empire, who procure them&s;elves to be regi&s;tered in this body, in order to be intitled to their privileges. The bachelors only are capable of bearing offices in the barracks or chambers at Con&s;tantinople. When any of the Janizaries are di&s;abled in the &s;ervice, they have an allowance for life. To di&s;tingui&s;h them, they wear a cap of a particular make. The emperor's guards are compo&s;ed of them, and they are feared and re&s;pected every where, though they carry only a cane in their hand; for arms are not delivered to them but when they take the field. The chief commanders of the army are di&s;tingui&s;hed by two or three hor&s;e-tails car|ried before them. The Turki&s;h navy is not &s;o con&s;iderable as might be expected in &s;uch ex|ten&s;ive dominions, &s;ituated on &s;everal &s;eas, and abounding in commodious harbours. By their neg|lecting navigation and foreign commerce, they can never find &s;ailors to man a great fleet; and tho&s;e
<PB N="97" REF="1010">
they have are un&s;kilful, as well as their pilots and officers. If they would apply them&s;elves to navi|gation, and make the mo&s;t of their &s;ituation and advantages, they could not fail to become a very formidable maritime power. Their navy generally con&s;i&s;ts of about forty large &s;hips, exclu&s;ive of gal|lies. In time of war they hire or buy merchant &s;hips, and others are &s;ent them from Algiers, Tu|nis, and Tripoli. The captain-ba&s;&s;a, or admiral, is the &s;econd officer in the empire, the grand-vizir being the only officer above him. His power is ab&s;olute, when he is out of the Dardanelles; and not only the &s;ea-officers, but all the governors of the maritime provinces, receive orders from him. The pilots are mo&s;tly Greeks, and the captains renegadoes. The captain-ba&s;&s;a &s;ails round the Ar|chipelago, in &s;ummer, to collect the capitation|tax, and learn the &s;tate of affairs in tho&s;e parts.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUES.</HEAD>
<P>The revenues of the empire are paid either into the public trea&s;ury, or into the &s;ultan's private trea&s;ury. The former, called by the Turks Deitul|mali Mu&s;limim, i. e. the public money of the Mu&s;&s;elmen, is not to be touched but on the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing exigency of the &s;tate. The other the &s;ultan may di&s;po&s;e of at plea&s;ure. Prince Canti|mer &s;ays, in his time, twenty-&s;even thou&s;and pur&s;es, amounting to thirteen million and a half of crowns, were annually returned to both trea&s;uries; ari&s;ing from the produce of the cu&s;toms, deme&s;ne lands, the capitation or tax paid by every &s;ubject of the empire who is not of the Mahometan religion, the annual tributes paid by the cham of the Crim Tar|tars, the princes of Moldavia, Walachia, the little republic of Ragu&s;a, and part of Mingrelia; toge|ther with half a million of money out of a million
<PB N="98" REF="1020">
and an half levied annually in Egypt. The&s;e are the fixed revenues: but va&s;t &s;ums are al&s;o rai&s;ed by the confi&s;cations of the e&s;tates and effects of the ba&s;&s;as and other officers, and from the e&s;tates of Turks dying without male-i&s;&s;ue.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>The manufactures and commodities of Turkey are &s;ilks, carpets, goat's hair, wool, camel's-hair, cotton yarn, dimity, burdets, waxed-linen, &s;ha|green-&s;kins, blue, red, and yellow Morocco-leather, coffee, rhubarb, turpentine, &s;torax, gums, opium, galls, ma&s;tic, emery, lemnian-bole, pomegranate|&s;hells, &s;ponges, dates, almonds, wine, oil, figs, rai&s;ins, mother of p$arl, boxwood, &s;affron, &amp;c. The&s;e are exported in large quantities by the &s;e|veral European trading nations, who import their own goods, and purcha&s;e tho&s;e of the country. The inland trade is carried on chiefly by the Jews and Armenians; and even the Turks &s;end mer|chandi&s;e, both by land and water, from one part of the empire to another&punc; but not to foreign chri&s;|tian countries. No nation is more advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for traffic than the Turki&s;h, having the na|vigation of the Black-&s;ea, the Levant, and the Red-&s;ea, and con&s;equently greater opportunities of importing the rich merchandizes of the Ea&s;t, and di&s;tributing them all over Europe, than any maritime power: but they never attempt di&s;tant voyages, and have but few merchant &s;hips, both their imports and exports being chiefly made in foreign bottoms. Tyre, Sidon, and Alexandria, which once commanded the navigation and trade of the world, are in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, but make no figure in commerce at this day: and well it is for the Chri&s;tians that the Turks are &s;uch an indolent generation; for their &s;ituation and va&s;t extent of
<PB N="99" REF="1030">
empire would enable them to monopolize the trade of the world, if they attended to it. Seve|ral European Chri&s;tian nations have envoys and re&s;idents at Con&s;tantinople, and con&s;uls in other ports. In this empire there is a great traffic in the human &s;pecies, not only male &s;laves, but beau|tiful young girls, being publickly bought and &s;old.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>COINS.</HEAD>
<P>The gold coins of Turkey are the altines or ducats, and the zechinos. The former are worth about &s;even &s;hillings and &s;ix-pence a-piece, and the latter about nine &s;hillings.</P>
<P>The &s;ilver coins are the a&s;per, worth three half|pence, the para four-pence halfpenny, the gro&s;h about three-pence, the krip about eleven-pence, and the &s;olola about two &s;hillings and two-pence farthing. A pur&s;e is equal to one hundred and eight pounds &s;ix &s;hillings and eight-pence.</P>
<P>Gold and &s;ilver coins of all countries go for their value.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Turks are of the Mahometan religion, the principles of which are: that Mahomet was &s;ent by God, who dictated to him the Coran, by which they are enjoined to believe in God, in his-angels, his &s;criptures, and prophets, e&s;pecially the Coran and Mahomet, in the re&s;urrection and day of judg|ment, and in God's ab&s;olute decrees both of good and evil; to ob&s;erve the pre&s;cribed ablutions be|fore their devotions; to pray at the appointed times with their faces towards Mecca; to give alms; to fa&s;t in the month of Ramadan or Ramazan; to go once in pilgrimage to the caaba, or hou&s;e of God at Mecca, either per&s;onally or by proxy; to ab|&s;tain
<PB N="100" REF="1040">
from &s;trong liquor, games of chance, pro|phe&s;ying with arrows, certain foods, as blood, pork, or any bea&s;t dying with &s;ickne&s;s, killed by a wild bea&s;t, a fall, or a &s;troke; from wor|&s;hipping idols, u&s;ury, and &s;ome &s;uper&s;titious and Pagan practices. Polygamy is allowed of, and &s;o are divorces. The Mahomedans are divided into two great &s;ects, viz. Ali and Omar. The Turks are of the latter, and the Per&s;ians of the former. Their places of wor&s;hip are called mo&s;ques. The chief eccle&s;ia&s;tic is the mufti, who&s;e office is of great dignity. The Turki&s;h monks are called dervi&s;es, and their prie&s;ts imans. A mola is a &s;ort of archbi&s;hop; a cadali&s;quer, who is al&s;o a layman, may be compared to a patriarch; and a cadi to a bi&s;hop. I&s;lam &s;ignifies the doctrine of Mahomet; and Mo&s;lemen, or Mo&s;lem, the pro|fe&s;&s;ors thereof. The fa&s;t of Ramadan is followed by a &s;ea&s;on of fe&s;tivity, called the Beiram. The Chri&s;tians and Jews re&s;iding among the Turks en|joy full liberty of con&s;cience. It is a mi&s;take that the Mahomedans believe that the women have no &s;ouls; or that if they have, they will not be pu|ni&s;hed or rewarded in the next life. Mahomet had too great a re&s;pect for the fair &s;ex to teach &s;uch a doctrine: and there are &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages in the Coran which affirm, that women will be rewarded or puni&s;hed in the next life according to their be|haviour in this. Tho' the Mahomedans tolerate all religions, yet they encourage and reward none but the di&s;ciples of their own. They allow no churches to be built on new foundations, or the rebuilding of tho&s;e which are decayed, without extorting an extravagant fine from the poor people for the liberty of building them.</P>

<HEAD>TITLES of the EMPEROR and EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P><Q>The emperor's title runs thus: &startq;We the &s;er|vant and lord of the mo&s;t honoured and ble&s;&s;ed cities, the venerable hou&s;es and &s;acred places, be|fore which all nations bow; of Mecca, which God delights to honour; of the re&s;plendent Medina, and the holy city of Jeru&s;alem; of the imperial and de&s;irable cities of Con&s;tantinople, Adrianople, and Bur&s;a, emperor; al&s;o of Babylon, Dama&s;cus, of the fragrant paradi&s;e, and the incomparable Egypt; of all Arabia, Aleppo, Antioch, and many other highly celebrated and memorable places, cities, and faithful va&s;&s;als, emperor; emperor of emperors, the mo&s;t gracious and all-powerful &s;ul|tan, &amp;c.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The empire is &s;tiled the Ottoman kingdom or empire, the Ottoman Porte, the Sublime Porte, the Sublime Sultanian Porte, &amp;c. The appella|tion of Porte is &s;aid to be derived from the large gate built by Mahomed II. at the entrance of the &s;eraglio at Con&s;tantinople; though the Orientals, in general, call a royal palace the king's porte or gate.</P>
<P>Having given a general account of the origin, religion, con&s;titution, government, manners, &amp;c. of the Turks, we now proceed to a particular de&s;cription of that part of the empire called Turkey in Europe.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TURKEY in EUROPE</HEAD>
<P>Is of great extent, and comprehends many coun|tries, &s;ome entirely &s;ubject to the Porte, and others dependent upon and tributary to it. It is bounded &s;outhward by the Mediterranean; north|ward by Croatia, Sclavoni&aacute;, and Tran&s;ylvania;

ea&s;tward by Poland, Ru&s;&s;ia, and A&s;ia; and we&s;t|ward by the Adriatic and Dalmatia <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Sclavonia, Croatia, and Dalmatia, which by &s;ome are in|cluded in Turkey, &s;hall be de&s;cribed after Hungary, as be|longing mo&s;tly to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria and the Venetians.</NOTE>.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, PRODUCE, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>The air of Turkey in Europe in general is very healthful, but the plague is often brought from Egypt, and carries off great numbers; the Turks from cu&s;tom, and the belief of prede&s;tina|tion, taking little pains to guard again&s;t it. The provinces are univer&s;ally fruitful, though with &s;ome difference. All the nece&s;&s;aries of life are equally cheap and good, and would be much more &s;o, were not many tracts &s;uffered to lie wa&s;te, and the re&s;t badly cultivated. The chief rivers of Turkey in Europe are the Save, the Danube, the Nie&s;ter, the Nieper, the Don, and Theis, which falls into the Euxine or Black-&s;ea. Turkey in Europe is not &s;o populous as might be expected; which is attributed to war, pe&s;tilence, polygamy, and the avarice and tyranny of the go|vernors. The inhabitants vary &s;till more than the countries, con&s;i&s;ting of Turks, Greeks, Arme|nians, Servians, Bo&s;nians, Bulgarians, Walachians, and Tartars, with no incon&s;iderable number of Jews.</P>
<P>In de&s;cribing the particular countries contained in Turkey in Europe, we &s;hall begin with Roma|nia, as it contains the capital and &s;eat of the Empire.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ROMANIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had its name from the Romans, when the &s;eat of the empire
<PB N="103" REF="1070">
was removed from Rome to Con&s;tantinople. The Turks call it Rumuli, being antiently a part of Thrace. To the north it is bounded by mount Haemus; to the &s;outh by the Archipelago; to the we&s;t by Macedonia and the river Strymon; and to the ea&s;t by the Black-&s;ea, the Strait of Con|&s;tantinople, the &s;ea of Marmora, or the Propon|tis, and the Helle&s;pont. Its length from Con&s;tan|tinople to the extremity of Macedonia is about two hundred and eighty miles, and its breadth a|bout one hundred and eighty. The chief rivers are the Maritz, antiently called Hebrus, the Ne&s;|&s;us, or Ne&s;tus, and the Strymon, which fall in|to the Archipelago, or Aegean-&s;ea. The level part of the country towards the &s;ea is plea&s;ant, and fruitful in corn, pa&s;ture, and rice; but that which lies among the mountains Haemus, Rhodope, Pangaeus, and Orbelus, is cold and barren. In the mountains are mines of &s;ilver, lead, and alum; but almo&s;t entirely neglected. The Turks re|duced this country towards the middle of the fif|teenth century, and have held it ever &s;ince. The beiglerbeg of Romania is the chief in Europe, and has an income of about twelve thou&s;and crowns per annum. The Greeks and Jews are very nu|merous in this province, which is governed by three &s;angeacs under the beiglerbeg, and contains the following places of note:</P>
<P>Con&s;tantinople, the capital of the whole Turk|i&s;h empire, and the re&s;idence of the grand &s;ignior, is very plea&s;antly and advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated, for it &s;tands on a point of land, that is wa&s;hed by the &s;ea of Mamora on the &s;outh, and the Thracian Bo&s;phorus, or Strait of Con&s;tantinople, on the ea&s;t and north. In con&s;equence of this &s;ituation it has a mo&s;t charming pro&s;pect, and a communication by water with mo&s;t parts of the empire. It was antiently called Byzantium, and afterwards Con|&s;tantinople,
<PB N="104" REF="1080">
from Con&s;tantine the Great, who transferred the &s;eat of the empire hither from Rome. The Turks now call it I&s;tampol, and the Greeks I&s;tampoli, or Stampoli. The former have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it ever &s;ince the year 1453, when it was taken after a &s;iege of fifty-four days. It &s;tands in lat. 41&deg;. 0&prime;. long. 28&deg;. 40&prime;. ea&s;t, being about &s;ix hundred and ninety miles from Vienna towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t, nine hundred and fifty &s;outh-we&s;t from Mo&s;cow, and fourteen hundred and thirty-five &s;outh-ea&s;t from London. The canal or &s;trait, which &s;eparates it from the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, is about a mile broad. It is of a triangular figure, and of great extent, including the &s;uburbs. Tho' the appearance it makes from without is very grand, yet the &s;treets are narrow, dark, &s;teep, ill paved, and &s;lippery, and mo&s;t of the hou&s;es low, mean, and beggarly, being built of wood and mortar, but crowded with inhabitants. The fine&s;t buildings are either without the city near the har|bour, or within, where it is mo&s;t thinly inhabited. The fortifications are old, and not capable of making any great re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t an army. The gates are in number twenty-two, of which &s;ix are towards the land, and the re&s;t towards the &s;ea. The bagnios, bazars, &s;eraglios, and the mo&s;ques, with their menarets, or high &s;lender &s;pires, make a fine appearance at a di&s;tance, e&s;pecially at the entrance of the canal of the Black-&s;ea. The hou&s;es being mo&s;tly of wood and mud, the fires, which frequently happen, make dreadful havock among them; the &s;oldiers, it is &s;aid, &s;ometimes &s;etting them on fire for the &s;ake of pilfering. When a fire breaks out, to prevent the whole city from being devoured by the flames, the only remedy they have is to blow up a great number of hou&s;es. The mo&s;ques, of which there are &s;even &s;tiled royal, are very hand&s;ome edifices. They
<PB N="105" REF="1090">
&s;tand every one &s;ingle, within a &s;pacious in|clo&s;ure, planted with lofty trees, and adorned with delightful fountains. The Turks &s;uffer not a dog to enter the mo&s;ques, and no one pre&s;umes to hold di&s;cour&s;e in tho&s;e inclo&s;ures, or do the lea&s;t irreverent action. The harbour lies to the north of the city, and is both convenient and &s;pacious. The river Lycus falls into it on the north-north-we&s;t. Abundance of tunny fi&s;h are caught in it. They were called by the antients palamides, and are frequently repre&s;ented on the medals of Byzantium with the heads of the emperors Caligula, Claudius, Caracalla, &amp;c. If the Turks would apply them&s;elves to naviga|tion, they might make them&s;elves very formida|ble by &s;ea, for they have the be&s;t harbours in the Mediterranean; and from the Red-&s;ea they might carry on a trade with all parts of the Ea&s;t-Indies, without doubling the Cape of Good Hope. The only wind to which the port of Con&s;tantinople is expo&s;ed is that from the ea&s;t, which occa&s;ions a terrible noi&s;e and confu&s;ion, e&s;pecially when it happens in the night. At the point of the triangle, near the canal and harbour, &s;tands the &s;eraglio, which is a mile and a half round, being rather a collection of palaces than one &s;ingle building. From the main entrance, which by the Turks is called Capi, i. e. the gate or port, the Turki&s;h empire takes its name. Be|low the palace, on the declivity of a hill, are the gardens, lying where it is &s;uppo&s;ed Old Bizantium &s;tood; from whence there is a view of the de|lightful coa&s;t of the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia, and the &s;eraglio of Scutari. In the &s;eraglio, properly &s;o called, is the hall or chamber where amba&s;&s;adors have their audiences, which is of amazing magnificence, e&s;pecially the throne, and the ne plus ultra both of them and all other foreigners. A man's curio|&s;ity
<PB N="106" REF="1100">
might co&s;t him dear, &s;hould he proceed far|ther. Within the bounds of this &s;eraglio are the grand &s;ignior's apartments, the women's apart|ments, the mint, the infirmary, the kitchens, the &s;tables, the trea&s;ury, the great council chamber, where the divan is held; the old &s;eraglio, in which the wives of the decea&s;ed &s;ultans are &s;hut up, the apartments for the eunuchs, and other officers, the pages or ichoglans, and the azamoglans, who are employed in the mo&s;t &s;ordid offices of the &s;e|raglio. It is &s;aid forty thou&s;and cart-loads of wood for fuel, and forty thou&s;and oxen for provi|&s;ion, are yearly con&s;umed in it, be&s;ides two hun|dred &s;heep daily, one hundred lambs, or goats, according to the &s;ea&s;on, ten calves, two hundred hens, two hundred pair of chickens, one hundred pair of pidgeons, and fifty green gee&s;e. Among the mo&s;ques, the mo&s;t magnificent is that of St. Sophia, once a chri&s;tian church: it is &s;aid, in many re&s;pects, to excel that of St. Peter's, at Rome. It is built in the form of a Greek cro&s;s on an eminence, and in the clear is two hundred and fifty-two feet long, and two hundred and twenty-eight broad. The dome, which covers almo&s;t the whole &s;tructure, re&s;ts outwardly on four prodigious large towers, which have been added of late years to &s;upport it. The grand &s;ignior goes every Friday to it; but a chri&s;tian is &s;eldom or never admitted. It is adorned with a profu&s;ion of marble, porphyry, and Egyptian granite; but there are no pictures or &s;tatues in it or the other mo&s;ques. The royal mo&s;ques require &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums for their &s;upport, that, it is &s;aid, they con&s;ume one third of the land-revenue of the empire. We are told that the annual in|come of St. Sophia alone amounts to thirty-two thou&s;and pounds &s;terling. The&s;e revenues are ap|propriated to the keeping up the buildings, paying
<PB N="107" REF="1110">
the &s;alaries of the officers of the mo&s;que, provid|ing food for the poor, who come to the gate at certain hours, maintaining the ho&s;pitals that ad|join thereto, educating and breeding up &s;cholars in the law of Mahomet, relieving indigent trade&s;|men and the like; the re&s;t goes into the trea&s;ury of the mo&s;ques, which is kept in the ca&s;tle of the &s;even towers, and which the grand &s;ignior cannot in con&s;cience touch, but upon urgent occa&s;ions, when their religion is at &s;take. There are a great many Greek and Armenian churches in the city, with two or three for the Roman catholics, and one for the Lutherans, which was built by the Swedes, with the con&s;ent of the Porte. There are &s;ome noble antiquities in and about Con&s;tanti|nople, particularly the antient Hypodrome, called by the Greeks Atmeidan. At the &s;outh end of the city is the ca&s;tle of the &s;even towers, to which an eighth was added not many years ago. It is a pri&s;on for &s;tate criminals, as the Tower of Lon|don is with us. The bazars, or beze&s;teins, are large &s;quare buildings covered with domes, and &s;tored with all manner of merchandizes, where the Turks, Jews, Greeks, and Armenians, meet for traffic. Not far from the old and new bazars is the &s;lave-market, where &s;laves of both &s;exes, in|cluding a number of beautiful young girls, bought up chiefly by the Jews in Girca&s;&s;ia, Georgia, Greece, and el&s;ewhere, are publicly expo&s;ed to &s;ale. Such of them, both men and women, to whom nature has been &s;paring of her charms, are &s;et apart for the vile&s;t &s;ervices; but &s;uch girls as have youth and beauty, pa&s;s their time very agreeably, only they are often forced to turn Ma|hometans. The Jews, who are the greate&s;t dealers in this traffic, to make the female &s;laves &s;ell the better, take great care of their education, and teach them to dance, &s;ing, and play on various
<PB N="108" REF="1120">
in&s;truments, and every accompli&s;hment that can in&s;pire love. Tho&s;e whom their de&s;tiny places in the &s;eraglio are not always the mo&s;t fortunate: it is true, a poor &s;hepherd's daughter may come to be a &s;ultane&s;s; but great numbers are entirely ne|glected by the &s;ultan. After his death they are &s;hut up for the re&s;t of their days in the old &s;era|glio, which the Turks call E&s;qui Serai, and which is &s;urrounded by a wall two miles in compa&s;s, within which are lodgings and gardens. There, unle&s;s &s;ome ba&s;&s;a courts them, they pine them|&s;elves away, bewailing the death of the &s;ultan, or that of their children, whom the new &s;ultan often cau&s;es to be &s;trangled. The gate of this &s;e|raglio is always guarded by Capigis and Janizaries. Here, and all over Turkey, are harans or pub|lic inns, where travellers of whatever religion or country may lodge three days gratis; and in not a few, they are provided with food. The pa|lace of the Greek patriarch &s;tands on a hill not far from the harbour, near the patriarchal church, dedicated to St. George. The Janizaries, who, as we ob&s;erved before, amount to about forty thou&s;and, are lodged within the imperial palace, in fifty-two odas or chambers. It is &s;aid there are two thou&s;and bo&s;tangis, or gardeners, employ|ed to take care of the gardens of the &s;eraglio, and yet they do not excel in beauty and neatne&s;s. The city and &s;uburbs are affirmed to be twenty|four miles in circumference, and the number of inhabitants about a million, of which more than half are Greeks and Armenians. The plague often makes a dreadful havock among them, vi|&s;iting them generally once a-year. The hypo|drome, or running-place for hor&s;es, which we mentioned above, is an oblong &s;quare, four hun|dred paces long, and one hundred wide. It is
<PB N="109" REF="1130">
adorned with three beautiful antique pillars, two of marble, and one of bra&s;s. Of the marble, one is called the hieroglyphical pillar, being en|graven on the four &s;ides with many odd figures or hieroglyphics. A foreigner, taking a Janizary with him, may walk all over the city without the lea&s;t in&s;ult or mole&s;tation. The environs are ex|tremely plea&s;ant, e&s;pecially along the Strait, being covered with towns, villages, &s;eats, gardens, meadows, vineyards, and woods. The &s;uburbs are tho&s;e of Ejup, or St. Job, Galata, Ca&s;&s;un Ba&s;cha, St. Demetrio, Pera, and Tophana. The fir&s;t is on the we&s;t &s;ide of the city, the &s;econd on the &s;ide of the harbour oppo&s;ite to Con&s;tantinople, with Ca&s;&s;un Ba&s;cha, St. Demetrio, and Pera, ad|joining to it. Tophana lies directly fronting the imperial palace. Galata is chiefly inhabited by Chri&s;tians and Jews, and is the hand&s;ome&s;t &s;uburb of the whole city. It is pretty well fortified with walls, towers, and moats. A much greater de|gree of liberty is found in Galata than is expe|rienced throughout the whole Ottoman em|pire. Taverns are tolerated in it, to which the Turks them&s;elves re&s;ort to take a chearful gla&s;s. There are al&s;o &s;everal Greek and Roman catholic churches and convents in it, with the merchants warehou&s;es, a fine fi&s;h-market, and the der&s;ana or dock. The &s;ituation of Pera is perfectly charm|ing, and the air healthy; from it you have a view of the whole coa&s;t of A&s;ia, and of the grand &s;ig|nior's &s;eraglio. Here mo&s;t of the chri&s;tian en|voys re&s;ide. The foreign merchants al&s;o have their hou&s;es in Pera, promi&s;cuou&s;ly with the Jews, Greeks, Armenians, and Turks. The &s;eraglio here is running to decay. Topana takes its name from the ar&s;enal or foundery for cannon here, which in Turki&s;h is called by that name. The Turks ca&s;t very good cannon; but their artillery is quite

plain, and without the lea&s;t ornament. Con&s;tanti|nople and its &s;uburbs are well &s;upplied with water, conveyed thither at a va&s;t charge over hills and valleys by aqueducts. On the &s;trait, where the Black Sea communicates with the Sea of Marmora, are great numbers of fine &s;etas; among the&s;e is Be&s;ikta&s;ch, the u&s;ual &s;ummer re&s;idence of the emperor and his women. In the neighbourhood is a &s;trong ca&s;tle commanding the entrance of the &s;trait from the Black Sea, and oppo&s;ite to it, in Natolia, is another. At a little di&s;tance al&s;o is a place called Belgrade from its beauty and plea|&s;antne&s;s. It lies high, has a good air, is &s;haded with abundance of woods, watered with many &s;prings, &s;tored with &s;everal &s;orts of game, and accommodated with &s;mall villages at convenient di&s;tances. Here the grand &s;ignior has kio&s;kes, or &s;mall plea&s;ure hou&s;es, which he &s;ometimes vi|&s;its. The foreign mini&s;ters have al&s;o their places of retirement here. At the i&s;&s;ue of the Black-&s;ea, is a lighthou&s;e for the &s;afety of mariners, and near it are the remains of Pompey's pillar, and of Ovid's tower.</P>
<P>A very late traveller makes the following re|marks upon the city of Con&s;tantinople, and the manners and cu&s;toms of the Turks: "Con&s;tan|tinople, &s;ays he, is one of the large&s;t cities in the world, and is &s;aid to contain &s;even or eight hundred thou&s;and people, and would be &s;till fuller of inhabitants if the government would admit it. It is built on very unequal ground, and the &s;treets are con&s;equently the &s;ame: they are paved; and though not &s;o clean as tho&s;e at the Hague, are not &s;o dirty as tho&s;e were in London. The hou&s;es are built of wood and plai&s;ter; they make no great appearance without, but are con|venient and &s;ometimes very rich within: mo&s;t of them command fine pro&s;pects to the &s;ea. There
<PB N="111" REF="1150">
are no carriages for the tran&s;portation of goods in this city; porters are the general vehicles made u&s;e of, except for timber and heavy loads, they u&s;e hor&s;es, and tie the boards on their backs. Mo&s;t things come to the city from the Black and White Seas by water. The inhabitants are ex|tremely clean and well dre&s;&s;ed, e&s;pecially the Turks, in gay colours and the cleane&s;t turbans: each per|&s;on here is di&s;tingui&s;hed by his cloaths; and the variety of different &s;haped turbans denote the &s;i|tuations of the different wearers. The women in the &s;treet wear robes of green, red, yellow, blue, which cover intirely their under-dre&s;s, which is very rich; they wear a piece of mu&s;lion on their head, as far as the eye, and another on their chins, to the top of the no&s;e, &s;o that their eyes only are uncovered: they walk much about the &s;treets, and the boats and the canal are full of them. The market-places and large &s;treets in the city of Con|&s;tantinople are almo&s;t covered over with &s;heds; the merchandize is &s;et forth in the neate&s;t manner, but the du&s;t among &s;uch a number of people be|ing confined, is exceeding trouble&s;ome. The number of boats in the canal is very great, they are the be&s;t built I ever &s;aw, and the rowers in|comparable. They have much difficulty to avoid running again&s;t each other. The gulf is near a mile acro&s;s; the &s;hore on each &s;ide the canal looks beautiful, with the villages thereon, which reach ten or twelve miles, almo&s;t as far as Bujukdere, the u&s;ual country re&s;idence of the Frank mini&s;ters. The &s;treets in this city are free from di&s;turbance. There &s;its a Turk, with a twi&s;ted &s;tick in his hand, on a little carpet, at the corner of mo&s;t of the &s;treets, who, together with his companions, im|mediately a&s;&s;emble on any occa&s;ion that is nece&s;&s;a|ry. The police of this city is, in many re&s;pects,
<PB N="112" REF="1160">
beyond that of any other. Provi&s;ions are always in great plenty, very cheap, and very good. This proceeds from its being the duty of the grand vizir him&s;elf, the fir&s;t per&s;on in the empire after the grand &s;ignior, and who certainly is the fir&s;t &s;ubject on earth in eminence and power, to vi&s;it, in the different parts of the city, the markets and &s;hops, which he does generally every month or oftener; at which time he is followed, at a di&s;tance by his officers, whom he precedes, dre&s;&s;ed like a private man, enquires into the prices of provi&s;ion and examines their value; if he finds them bad, over-rated, or deficient in weight or mea&s;ure, then he a&s;&s;umes the magi&s;trate, calls to his attendants, and puni&s;hes immediately the offenders very &s;e|verely, but &s;eldom with death. The late grand vizir invented a new puni&s;hment for the bakers who &s;old bad bread, or &s;uch as was deficient in weight: he cau&s;ed them to be hung up by the &s;houlders at their own doors for a con&s;iderable time. There are few phy&s;icians, fewer apothecaries, and no &s;urgeons here; the inhabitants therefore know little of the horrid mi&s;chiefs occa&s;ioned by a certain di&s;ea&s;e we labour under in great cities."</P>
<P>Adrianople, called by the Turks Edrene, is a large city on the river Maritz, one hundred and ten miles from Con&s;tantinople towards the north|we&s;t. It had the name of Adrianople from the emperor Adrian, by whom it was repaired in the year 122. Before that it was called U&s;cudama. The Turks fir&s;t took it from the Chri&s;tians in the year 1360. The river Caradare, or Arde, here falls into the Maritz. Hard by the city is an im|perial palace, or &s;eraglio, in which the &s;ultan, with his court, &s;ometimes re&s;ides, e&s;pecially in time of war, and when the plague rages at Con|&s;tantinople. Adrianople is the &s;eat of a Greek

bi&s;hop, contains &s;ome very magnificent mo&s;ques, &s;tands in a very fertile country, and, by means of its rivers, carries on a very con&s;iderable traffic. The hou&s;es are &s;aid to be mo&s;tly low, built of wood and clay, and &s;ome of bricks, and the &s;treets &s;o dirty, that a man mu&s;t wear boots in winter. The number of the inhabitants are computed at about one hundred thou&s;and. The wine, pro|duced in the neighbouring country, is reckoned the be&s;t in Turkey. Here is a fine bazar, called Ali Ba&s;&s;a, half a mile long, furni&s;hed with all &s;orts of rich goods, and kept by Turks, Greeks, Ar|menians, and Jews. Sultan Selim's mo&s;que is an edifice of &s;urpri&s;ing magnificence On a hill with|in the city is a murada, or mona&s;tery, of Turki&s;h monks. The city is governed by a mola-cadi, who has an ab&s;olute &s;way, both in civil and cri|minal matters. Both Con&s;tantinople and Adri|anople lie in the &s;angiak&s;hip of Byzea, which ex|tends from the ea&s;t of mount Haemus to the &s;ea of Marmora.</P>
<P>Philippoli, a pretty large town, &s;ituated on the we&s;tern bank of the Maritz, which carries boats hither, and thereby &s;upplies the town with all ne|ce&s;&s;aries and conveniencies. It &s;tands ninety miles from Adrianople to the north-we&s;t near mount Haemus, is the &s;ee of a Greek archbi&s;hop, and took its name from Philip, the father of Alexan|der the Great, by whom it was founded. Mr. Paul Lucas &s;ays, this is the only town in Turkey where he &s;aw a &s;teeple with a clock that &s;trikes the hours. The Turks fir&s;t made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it in 1360.</P>

<P>Kirk-Eccle&s;ie, a town twelve leagues from A|drianople, inhabited chiefly by Jews. It was antiently called <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, or forty churches, from the number of chri&s;tian churches it contained. The above four towns lie in the &s;angiak&s;hip of Kirkeli, on the north &s;ide of mount Haemus.</P>
<P>Gallipoli, a con&s;iderable town, with a &s;pacious harbour, &s;eated on that celebrated &s;trait antiently called the Helle&s;pont, which divides Europe from A&s;ia, and is &s;everal miles broad, being now called the &s;trait of Gallipoli, or the Dardanelles. It is about ninety miles from Con&s;tantinople towards the &s;outh-we&s;t. The chief employment of the inha|bitants is &s;aid to be making arrows. The doors to the Greek and Jew hou&s;es are not above two feet and a half high in this and many other towns in Turkey, to prevent the Turks, in their frolicks, from coming on hor&s;eback into the hou&s;es, where they would commit a thou&s;and outrages. Its pre|&s;ent name is a corruption of its antient one of Calliopolis, which it is &s;aid to have had from Cal|lias, prince of the Athenians, by whom it was founded. In con&s;equence of its &s;ituation, its trade is very con&s;iderable. It gives name to a &s;angiak&s;hip, in which lies the penin&s;ula, antient|ly called the Thracian Cher&s;one&s;us. This pe|nin&s;ula is inhabited chiefly by Greeks, the de|&s;cendants of the antient Thracians. In the &s;ame &s;angiak&s;hip are &s;ituated Trajanopoli, Demotica, and A&s;trizza, with one of the ca&s;tles called the Dardanelles.</P>
<P>Trajanopoli &s;tands on the Maritz, thirty-three miles from Adrianople to the &s;outh, taking its name from Trajan, who repaired it. It is now a &s;mall town, but the &s;ee of a Greek archbi&s;hop.</P>

<P>A&s;trizza, now a mean place on the Archipelago, was antiently called Abdera, and was one of the mo&s;t celebrated cities in the world. Here Demo|critus the philo&s;opher was born, who put out his eyes, that he might the better exert his mind in &s;ublime contemplations. Protagoras, the philo|&s;opher, was al&s;o a native of this place. The an|tient inhabitants were very &s;ubject to frenzy and lunacy, which occa&s;ioned the proverb <HI>Abderitica mens,</HI> to denote a lunatic. Of the ca&s;tles called the Dardanelles, two &s;tand on each &s;ide, as you enter from the Archipelago, the canal or &s;trait antiently called the Helle&s;pont, and now the &s;trait of Gallipoli, the canal of the Dardanelles, the Arm of St. George, and by the Turks Boghers, or the &s;trait of the White-&s;ea. Two others &s;tand as you enter the &s;ea of Marmora, from this &s;trait. The four ca&s;tles are mounted with cannon, and garri|&s;oned. All &s;hips coming from Con&s;tantinople are &s;earched at the two la&s;t; tho&s;e that come from the Archipelago at the two fir&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;tles, which are above four miles a&s;under; but the others at Se&s;tas and Abydas, near the &s;ea of Marmora, or the Pro|pontis, are only about three quarters of a mile. The antient towns of Se&s;tos and Abydas, &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;tood at a little di&s;tance from the la&s;t of the&s;e ca&s;tles, where the &s;trait is narrowe&s;t, was famous for the loves of Hero and Leander, and for Xerxes's bridge. The &s;ea of Marmora, called antiently the Propontis, has its name from an i&s;land in it.

<HEAD>BULGARIA.</HEAD>
<P>Bulgaria is bounded to the &s;outh by mount Haemus, which &s;eparates it from Romania; to the north by the Danube; to the ea&s;t by the Black|&s;ea; and to the we&s;t by Servia. Its greate&s;t length from ea&s;t to we&s;t is about two hundred and eighty miles, and its breadth from north to &s;outh about one hundred and eighty. It was antiently called the Lower My&s;ia, but its modern name it had from the Bulgarians, who came from A&s;iatic Sarmatia. Towards the middle of the &s;ixteenth century it was &s;ubdued by the Turks under Amurath II. It is now a part of the great government under the beiglerbeg of Rumelia, and is divided into four &s;maller governments under their re&s;pective &s;an|geaks. The country is very mountainous; but has many rich and fruitful vallies, producing plen|ty of corn, wine, and pa&s;turage. There are many mineral waters both hot and cold in the mountains, and in that called Wetozcha are iron mines; but the chief product of the country is cattle. Va&s;t numbers of eagles breed in the neighbourhood of the town of Babadoge, where the archers all over Turkey &s;upply them&s;elves with feathers for their arrows. The principal rivers are the Danube and I&s;char. The inhabitants of Bulgaria are mo&s;tly of the Greek church, with a mixture of Turks and Jews. Their language is a dialect of the Scla|vonic. The places of mo&s;t note in the country are,</P>
<P>Sophia, a pretty large populous town on the I&s;cha, or Bojane, one hundred miles from Adri|nople,
<PB N="117" REF="1210">
and two hundred and &s;eventy from Con&s;tanti|nople to the north-we&s;t. The inhabitants call it Treditza. The name of Sophia it is &s;aid to have had from the wife of the emperor Trajan, who built it out of the ruins of the antient city of Sar|dica. It is one of the greate&s;t thoroughfares in Turkey, &s;ince all tho&s;e that travel from Con&s;tan|tinople for Venice, Ragu&s;a, and Hungary, mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily pa&s;s thro' it. Here the beiglerbeg of Ru|melia re&s;ides, tho' the air is &s;aid to be unwhole&s;ome; and the Greeks, Jews, and Armenians carry on a con&s;iderable trade. It has no walls, and the &s;treets are narrow and dirty, being paved only in the foot|ways.</P>
<P>Nicopoli, a large town on the Danube, two hundred and twenty miles from Adrianople to|wards the north, is &s;aid to have been built by the emperor Trajan, after the victory he had gained over the Dacae. It is noted in hi&s;tory for the fir&s;t defeat of the Chri&s;tians by the Turks in 1396.</P>
<P>Sili&s;tria, a large fortified town, and a bi&s;hop's &s;ee, on the Danube, &s;ixty-&s;ix miles from Nicopoli to the ea&s;t, and two hundred and &s;ixty from Con|&s;tantinople to the north-north-we&s;t, was antient|ly called Doro&s;tulus. Very few of its inhabi|tants are Turks. Near it are &s;ome remains of the wall which the Grecian emperors built again&s;t the inroads of the Barbarians.</P>
<P>Tomi&s;war, or Tomis, a town on the Black-&s;ea, twenty miles to the &s;outh of the neare&s;t mouth of the Danube, for the Danube di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Black-&s;ea by &s;even months. Some take it to be the antient Tomi, Tomis, Tomea, or Tomos, once the capital of Le&s;&s;er Scythia, and the place of Ovid's exile; but others place it at Baba, ten miles to the north of Tomi&s;war.</P>
<P>Pre&s;law, a con&s;iderable town, antiently called Mercianopolis, from its having been built by Trajan, in honour of his &s;i&s;ter Marciana.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="1220">
In this country among the hills &s;tands an antient monument erected by Trajan, and for that rea&s;on called Trajan's-gate. It con&s;i&s;ts of two &s;tone-pil|lars, with an arch over them, repre&s;enting a gate. It appears to have been a very &s;tately &s;tructure, but is now greatly defaced. Along the Danube lies a di&s;trict called Dobrud&s;che, who&s;e inhabitants are remarkable for their ho&s;pitality. They are of Tartarian extraction, and called P&s;chkias. When a traveller pa&s;&s;es through any of their villages, all the inhabitants of both &s;exes come out to &s;alute him, intreating him in the civile&s;t manner to take up his lodgings with them, and partake of what God has been plea&s;ed to be&s;tow. If he accepts the invitation, he is entertained for the &s;pace of three days, together with his hor&s;es; his fare con&s;i&s;ting of honey, eggs, and bread baked under the embers, but of a very fine &s;ort.</P>

<HEAD>SERVIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country was antiently called Moe&s;ia Supe|rior or Prima, and inhabited chiefly by the Dar|dani, whence it was al&s;o called Dardania. It had its pre&s;ent name of Servia from the Servians, a people of Sarmatia A&s;iatica; and that of Ra&s;cia from the river Ra&s;ca. It is bounded on the &s;outh by Albania and Macedonia; on the north by the Danube, which parts it from Hungary; on the ea&s;t by Bulgaria; and on the we&s;t by Bo&s;nia. Its greate&s;t length is &s;aid to be about &s;eventy miles, but its breadth is very unequal, being in &s;ome
<PB N="119" REF="1230">
places thirty miles, in others no more than fif|teen. The air is temperate and healthful; and the &s;oil would be exceeding fruitful, and produce corn, wine, and pa&s;ture in abundance, if duly cultivated. The country is well watered with rivers, and di|ver&s;ified with plains, woods, and hills, the la&s;t of which are &s;aid to contain rich mines; but none of them are worked. The inhabitants breed great numbers of hor&s;es, and manufacture abundance of cotton. The language of the Servians is a dia|lect of the Sclavonic, approaching pretty near to that of Ru&s;&s;ia. As to religion, they are mo&s;tly Greeks, with a mixture of Jews, Papi&s;ts, and Ma|hometans. The Jews and Greeks manage the trade, and live in the cities, and the Turks in the boroughs and fortre&s;&s;es. This country was united to Hungary by a perpetual compact, and govern|ed by a ban, till it was conquered by &s;ultan Maho|met II. &s;ince which time it has been &s;ubject to the Turks. It is divided into four &s;angiak&s;hips, and contains the following places of &s;ome note.</P>
<P>Belgrade, in Latin called Alba Graecorum, and by the Turks Nandor Fejervar, is &s;eated at the conflux of the Save and Danube, on the fron|tiers of Hungary, about two hundred and fifty miles from Vienna to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and four hundred and fifty-five from Con&s;tantinople to the north-we&s;t. It is a large populous city, and &s;trong both by nature and art, being fortified with a ca&s;tle or citadel, and a double wall, flanked with a prodigious number of towers. It is very advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated for trade; for there are &s;everal other rivers be&s;ides the Danube and Save at no great di&s;tance from it: and a great trade is carried on here by Turki&s;h, Jewi&s;h, Greek, Hungarian, Armenian, Sclavonian, Au&s;|trian, and Ragu&s;an merchants. There are two large beze&s;teins or bazars, a &s;tately karavan&s;erai,
<PB N="120" REF="1240">
or public inn, and a college for young &s;tudents in the town. In 1717, the Hungarians and Au&s;|trians took it from the Turks; but in 1739 were obliged to evacuate it, though not till they had fir&s;t demoli&s;hed all its outworks, leaving nothing &s;tanding but the old walls, and &s;ome fortifications in&s;eparable from them.</P>

The hou&s;es here, as in all other Turki&s;h towns, are very &s;mall, low, and built only of wood and mortar.</P>
<P>U&s;cup, Scupi, Scopia, a large and well built town, at the foot of mount Orbilus, on the river Vardan, or Apius, fifteen miles from Ni&s;&s;a to the we&s;t, eighty-three from Sophia to the north-we&s;t, ninety-five from Belgrade to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and &s;eventy-five from the Danube to the &s;outh. It is a place of con&s;iderable trade, e&s;pecially in tanned leather. In the neighbourhood of this town is an aqueduct carried over a valley between two hills, and &s;upported by two hundred arches. There is al&s;o a fine bridge of twelve arches over the Var|dan.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other &s;maller towns and for|tre&s;&s;es in this province which we have not room to particularize.</P>

<HEAD>BOSNIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country and Servia make what is pro|perly called Turki&s;h Illyricum, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Hungarian Illyricum, containing Croatia, Sclavonia, and Dalmatia. It is bounded on the north by the river Save, which &s;eparates it from Sclavonia; on the &s;outh by a chain of mountains which part it from Dalmatia; on the ea&s;t by the Drino; and on the we&s;t by the Verbas; the for|mer of the&s;e rivers dividing it from Servia, and the latter from Croatia. It is &s;aid to be fifty miles long from north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t, and about twenty miles broad from north to &s;outh. It was antiently that part of Pannonia called Inferior, and took its pre&s;ent names of Bo&s;nia and Rama from the rivers Bo&s;na and Rama. Its air, &s;oil, produce, language, and inhabitants, are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Servia. Like Servia al&s;o, it was formerly united to Hungary, and go|verned by a prince or de&s;pota; but in 1465, the Turks made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of it; when Ste|phen V. la&s;t king of Bo&s;nia, was taken by Maho|met II. who cau&s;ed him to be flead alive.

<HEAD>WALACHIA, properly &s;o called, or WALACHIA beyond the MOUNTAINS.</HEAD>
<P>This country is bounded on the north partly by Moldavia, from which it is &s;eparated by a va&s;t chain of mountains and the river Sereth, and part|ly by Tran&s;ylvania; on the ea&s;t and &s;outh by the Danube; and on the we&s;t by part of Hungary and Tran&s;ylvania. It is of a triangular form, and its length about three hundred and fifty miles; but its breadth is very unequal, not exceeding, however, at mo&s;t two hundred miles. The Turks call it Cara Bogdiana, i. e. Black Bogdiania, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from Moldavia, which they call Bogdiana.</P>
<P>The air of Walachia is temperate, and the &s;oil very fruitful in corn, wine, fruits, and pa&s;ture, where duly cultivated; but there are but few of the inhabitants, comparatively &s;peaking, who ap|ply
<PB N="123" REF="1270">
them&s;elves to hu&s;bandry. The country, how|ever, abounds in cattle, and is noted for an excel|lent breed of hor&s;es. Wood is &s;o &s;carce that they are obliged to u&s;e hemp and cow-dung dried, for fuel. The mountains are &s;aid to be rich in metals, but there are no mines worked. A mineral &s;alt is found in the country, which is as hard as mar|ble, and of a purpli&s;h colour; but when well pounded it becomes white. The principal rivers that water this province are, the Aluta, the Ja|bonitz, and the Sereth, or Strech, which, with many &s;maller ones, di&s;charge them&s;elves into the Danube. The chri&s;tian religion, according to the Greek church, is profe&s;&s;ed in Walachia, and the patriarch of Con&s;tantinople is their metropo|litan; but the common people are wretchedly ig|norant, and even the learning of the clergy &s;eldom goes beyond reading and &s;inging well. Great numbers of Mohammedans and Jews live inter|mixed with tho&s;e of the Greek religion.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Walachia, being generally de|&s;cended from the old Roman colony &s;ettled there by Trajan, their language is a barbarous Latin intermixed with Turki&s;h and Sclavonian. It is like that jumble of languages called the Lin|gua Franca, which is under&s;tood almo&s;t all over the Ea&s;t, and particularly along the coa&s;t of the Mediterranean. The per&s;ons of rank among the Walachians, are &s;o fond of the Italian lan|guage, that they apply them&s;elves to it more than to their mother tongue; and generally &s;end their &s;ons to &s;tudy at the univer&s;ity of Padua. The waywode, prince, de&s;pot, or ho&s;podar of Wa|lachia, is a va&s;&s;al of the Ottoman Porte, paying a yearly tribute to it of about &s;ixty thou&s;and du|cats, and furni&s;hing a body of troops in time of war. The Turks often depo&s;e him for no other rea&s;on but becau&s;e another offers a larger tribute.
<PB N="124" REF="1280">
The trade of this country con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in corn and wine, which they export to Ru&s;&s;ia and Po|land, and in hides, wax and honey; they al&s;o &s;end beef dried in the &s;un, pul&s;e, and butter, to Con&s;tantinople. The trade is chiefly carried on by Armenians, Jews, Saxons, Hungarians, and Ragu&s;ans. The hou&s;es here are built only with timber and &s;traw, cemented together with reeds, with which this country abounds. Walachia is divided into two parts, denominated Walachia on this and the other &s;ide the river Aluta. The only places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Tergovi&s;to, or Terves, the capital of the country, where the waywode has a fine palace. It &s;tands on the river Jalonitz, in a mar&s;hy ground, about &s;ixty miles from the Danube to the north, and has a good trade, with &s;ome fortifications.</P>
<P>Buckere&s;t, a pretty &s;trong town and an archie|pi&s;copal &s;ee, on the Dembrowitz, thirty miles from Tergovi&s;to to the &s;outh-ea&s;t, and forty from the Danube to the north. Here is a &s;ort of aca|demy or univer&s;ity, and the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the waywode.</P>
<P>Langenau, or Campolungo, a pretty good town on the other &s;ide the Aluta, in the ea&s;tern part of the country.</P>
<P>There are &s;everal other towns in Walachia, as Baja, Or&s;owa, old and new, Bakow, or Bra&s;tkow, Rebnek, Jalonitza, Braila, Krajova, T&s;chernetz, &amp;c. On the Danube, within the limits of this country, are to be &s;een &s;ome remains of a bridge, in all probability that which the emperor Trajan laid over it, in order to attack Decebalus, king of the Dacians.</P>

<HEAD>MOLDAVIA.</HEAD>
<P>This country takes its name from the Moldau, which runs through it. It is al&s;o watered by the Pruth, the Sereth, Nei&s;ter, or Dnei&s;ter, being bounded to the &s;outh by Walachia; to the north by Poland; to the ea&s;t part by the Ukraine, from which the Nei&s;ter, or Tarla, divides it, and part|ly by Be&s;&s;arabia; and to the we&s;t by Tran&s;ylvania. Its greate&s;t length from &s;outh to north is about two hundred and forty miles, but its breadth va|ries from one hundred and fifty to eighty. Former|ly it had the name of Bogdania, from a chief named Bogdan, who brought a colony hither from Tran&s;ylvania in the twelfth century. It is &s;aid the Turks &s;till call it by that name. This is in general a mountainous barren country; but there are &s;ome fertile &s;pots in it, producing-corn, wine, pul&s;e, honey, wax, &amp;c. Great numbers of hor&s;es al&s;o are bred in it. The air is &s;aid to be whole|&s;ome, but &s;harper than that of Walachia. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants are of the Greek church, with a mixture of Mahometans, Papi&s;ts, &amp;c. The prince or waywode of Moldavia, like that of Wa|lachia, is &s;tiled ho&s;podar, and is tributary to the grand-&s;ignior, who depo&s;es him when he plea&s;es. The chief towns are,</P>
<P>Ja&s;&s;y, the capital, and re&s;idence of the waywode, &s;tands on the river Pruth, eighty miles from Bender, to the north-we&s;t. Before the year 1753 it was a con&s;iderable town, and pretty well forti|fied, but was then entirely de&s;troyed by fire. In what condition it is at pre&s;ent we cannot &s;ay.</P>

Near the Dnieper live the Siet&s;ch Co&s;&s;ack$, or the Haydamacks. The only place in it worth mentioning is Ockzakow, &s;ituate at the mouth of the Dnieper. It was antiently called Orde&s;&s;us. The Turks at pre&s;ent call it Kaahleh Ozi, i. e. the fortification of the Dnieper. The Ru&s;&s;ians, under count Munich, took it by a&s;&s;ault in 1737, when it was well fortified; but next year evacuated it, after demoli&s;hing the works.</P>

<HEAD>The Country betwixt the NIEPER and the DON.</HEAD>
<P>This country is inhabited by the Le&s;&s;er Nogay Tartars, who are dependent partly on the cham of the Crim Tartars, and partly on Ru&s;&s;ia. They &s;eldom apply them&s;elves to agriculture, but wan|der about in hords, and live chiefly on hor&s;e-fle&s;h. The religion they profe&s;s is Mahometi&s;m, though in other re&s;pects they are ju&s;tly denomi|nated Barbarians; yet their ho&s;pitality far exceeds that of the mo&s;t civilized Chri&s;tian natives.</P>

<HEAD>The CRIMEA.</HEAD>
<P>The country at pre&s;ent di&s;tingui&s;hed by this name was antiently called Cher&s;one&s;us Taurica. The Turks call it Kiram Atha&s;i, i. e. the Crim I&s;land. It is &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by the Black|&s;ea, and the &s;ea of Azoph, except where the i&s;thmus joins it to the continent. The &s;oil of this country is in many parts very fertile, and would, if cultivated, produce plenty of corn, wine, &amp;c. but the Tartars, who live chiefly on hor&s;e-fle&s;h, milk, and chee&s;e, de&s;pi&s;e agriculture, or leave it to their &s;laves and &s;trangers. Their religion is Mahometi&s;m. The country was an|tiently inhabited by the Scythians, Sarmatians, Goths, and Huns, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively; and there were &s;ome Greek colonies along the coa&s;t, of which the town of Bo&s;phorus was the mo&s;t con&s;iderable. Since the Crimea became dependent on the Turks, it hath often been invaded and laid wa&s;te by the Ru&s;&s;ians. The prince, by whom it is governed under the Porte, &s;tiles him&s;elf &s;overeign cham of Le&s;&s;er Tartary, &amp;c. though in reality he is a va&s;&s;al of the Porte, and mu&s;t take the field, when &s;ummoned, with a body of auxiliaries. The elde&s;t &s;on, or pre&s;umptive heir to the cham, has the title of &s;ultan Galga; the &s;econd prince is called Or Beg, i. e. the lord of Or, or Perecop; and the third Naradin Beg, &amp;c. The principal places in the penin&s;ula are,</P>
<P>Perecop, a fortified place on the i&s;thmus, which joins the penin&s;ula to the continent. This

<HEAD>GREECE.</HEAD>
<P>Greece, as is well known to the learned, was antiently the mo&s;t celebrated region in the world,
<PB N="130" REF="1340">
&s;urpa&s;&s;ing all others in arms, arts, and &s;ciences. Its antient name was Hellas, which the Latins changed into Graecia. It comprehends at pre&s;ent Macedonia, Albania, now called Arnaut, Epirus, The&s;&s;aly, now Janna, Achaia, now Livadia, the Peloponne&s;us, now Morea, together with the i&s;lands on its coa&s;t, and in the Archipelago. The continent of Greece is &s;eated betwixt the 36th and 43d degrees of north latitude; and be|tween the 19th and 27th degrees of longitude, ea&s;t of London. To the north it is bounded by Bulgaria and Servia, from which it is divided by a ridge of mountains; to the &s;outh by the Medi|terranean &s;ea; to the ea&s;t by Romania and the Archipelago; and to the we&s;t by the Adriatic, or gulph of Venice. Its length is &s;aid to be about four hundred miles, and its utmo&s;t breadth about three hundred and fifty. The air is extremely temperate and healthy, and the &s;oil fruitful, though badly cultivated, yielding corn, wine, delicious fruits, and abounding with cattle, fowls, and veni&s;on. As to religion, Chri&s;tianity was planted in Greece &s;oon after the death of our Sa|viour, and flouri&s;hed there for many ages in great purity; but &s;ince the Greeks have been &s;ubject to the Turki&s;h yoke, they have &s;unk into the mo&s;t de|plorable ignorance, in con&s;equence of the &s;lavery and thraldom under which they groan, and their religion is now greatly corrupted. It is indeed little better than a heap of ridiculous ceremonies and ab&s;urdities. The head of the Greek church is the patriarch of Con&s;tantinople, who is cho&s;en by the neighbouring archbi&s;hops and metropolitans, and confirmed by the emperor or grand vizir. He is a per&s;on of great dignity, being the head and director of the ea&s;tern church. The other patriarchs are tho&s;e of Jeru&s;alem, Antioch, and Alexandria. Mr. Tournefort tells us, that the patri|archates
<PB N="131" REF="1350">
are now generally &s;et to &s;ale, and be|&s;towed upon tho&s;e who are the highe&s;t bidders. The patriarchs, metropolitans, archbi&s;hops, and bi&s;hops, are always cho&s;en from among the Ca|loyers or Greek monks. Before the patriarchs receive their patents and the caftan, which is a ve&s;t of lind&s;ey-wool&s;ey, or &s;ome other &s;tuff, pre|&s;ented by the grand &s;ignior to amba&s;&s;adors and other per&s;ons newly inve&s;ted with &s;ome con&s;i|derable dignity, they are obliged to make large pre&s;ents to the vizir, &amp;c. The income of the patriarch of Con&s;tantinople is &s;aid to amount to no le&s;s than one hundred and twenty thou&s;and guilders, of which he pays the one half by way of annual tribute to the Ottoman porte, adding &s;ix thou&s;and guilders be&s;ides, as a of pre&s;ent, at the fea&s;t of Bairam. The next per&s;on to a bi&s;hop among the clergy is an archimandrite, who is the director of one or more convents, which are called mandren; then comes the ab|bot, the arch-prie&s;t, the prie&s;t, the deacon, the under-deacon, the chanter, and the lecturer. The &s;ecular clergy are &s;ubjected to no rules, and never ri&s;e higher than high-pre&s;t. They are al|lowed to marry once, but it mu&s;t be with a virgin, and before they are ordained. They have neither glebe nor tythes, but depend on the perqui&s;ites that ari&s;e from their office, and &s;eldom preach but in Lent. The Greeks have few nunneries, but a great many convents of monks, who are all prie&s;ts, and, &s;tudents excepted, obliged to follow &s;ome handicraft employment, and lead a very au&s;tere life. The Greeks deny the &s;upremacy of the pope, and abhor the wor|&s;hip of images; but have a multitude of pictures of &s;aints in their churches, whom they pray to as mediators. Their fa&s;ts are very &s;evere. They believe al&s;o in the doctrine of tran&s;ub&s;tantiation,
<PB N="132" REF="1360">
and that the Holy Gho&s;t does not proceed from the Son. They admit not of purgatory, &s;ays Mr. Thevenot; but yet they allow a third place, where they &s;ay the ble&s;&s;ed remain, in expec|tation of the day of judgment. At ma&s;s they con&s;ecrate with leavened bread, and commu|nicate under both kinds, as well laicks as prie&s;ts, and as well women and children as men. When they carry the &s;acrament to the &s;ick, they do not pro&s;trate them&s;elves before it, nor expo&s;e it to be adored: neither do they carry it in proce&s;&s;ion, or have any particular fea&s;t in honour of it. Bapti&s;m is performed among them by plunging the whole body of the child thrice into water. Immediately after bapti&s;m, they give it confirmation and the com|munion; and &s;even days after that, it undergoes the ceremony of ablution. When a prie&s;t is married, among other ceremonies, the bride|groom and bride drink each two gla&s;&s;es of wine; then the gla&s;s is given to the prie&s;t, who merrily drinks off the re&s;t of the wine, and breaking the gla&s;s, &s;ays, So may the bridegroom break the virginity of the bride. As to the character of the modern Greeks, they are &s;aid to be very covet|ous, hypocritical, treacherous, great pedira&s;ts, and at the &s;ame time revengeful to the highe&s;t degree; but very &s;uper&s;titious. They are &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed by the Turks, that they do not value even a Greek who turns Mahometan. The Turks are remarkable for their taciturnity: they never u&s;e any unnece&s;&s;ary words; but the Greeks, on the contrary, are very talkative and lively. The Turks generally practi&s;e what their religion enjoins, but the Greeks do not; and their mi&s;ery puts them upon a thou&s;and mean &s;hifts and &s;can|dalous practices, authorized by bad example, and perpetuated from father to &s;on. The Greek
<PB N="133" REF="1370">
women have fine features and beautiful com|plexions: their countenances &s;till very much re&s;emble tho&s;e of the antient Greek &s;tatues. The Greek language is now &s;o much corrupted and altered by the mixture of foreign words, that it differs extremely from the antient, being little under&s;tood by the pre&s;ent inhabitants, not even the prie&s;ts, who are in general very illiterate.</P>

<HEAD>MACEDONIA.</HEAD>
<P>The pre&s;ent boundaries of Macedonia are the river Ne&s;&s;us, or Ne&s;tus, to the north; The&s;&s;aly and Epirus to the &s;outh; the Archipelago to the ea&s;t; and Albania to the we&s;t. It is of a very irregular figure. The air is clear, &s;harp, and whole&s;ome, and the &s;oil, for the mo&s;t part, fer|tile, producing corn, wine, and oil. The coun|try abounds al&s;o in rich pa&s;tures, fine cattle, woods, and veni&s;on. Here too are many rivers and mountains. Of the former the principal are the Varder, antiently Axius; the Platamone, an|tiently Aliacmon; and the Vi&s;triza, formerly Erigion. The Strymon al&s;o pa&s;&s;es through part of Macedonia. Of the latter, the mo&s;t remarka|ble are Mount Athos and Pangaeus. Formerly Pangaeus was noted for very rich gold and &s;ilver mines. Athos, now commonly called Monte Santo, from the great number of monks and hermits that live here in convents, cells, and grottos, is &s;aid to be about eleven &s;tadia in height, that is, two miles and three fourths of a mile. Pliny &s;ays the &s;hadow of this mountain, before the &s;etting of the &s;un, at the &s;ummer &s;ol&s;tice, ex|tends
<PB N="134" REF="1380">
as far as the market-place of Myrrhina in the i&s;le of Lemnos, which is upwards of fifty miles di&s;tant. It &s;tands on a penin&s;ula running out into the Aegean &s;ea, and is, in reality, a ridge of mountains. The monks and anchorites lead very au&s;tere lives, their u&s;ual food being vegeta|bles, dried olives, figs, fruit, chee&s;e, and &s;ome|times fi&s;h. Mo&s;t of them follow trades, or cul|tivate vine-yards and olive-yards. There are upwards of twenty convents upon the mountain, and a town called Kareis, inhabited al&s;o by monks, and the re&s;idence of a Turki&s;h aga, under the bo&s;tangi ba&s;cha. The&s;e are all &s;urrounded with &s;trong walls, flanked with towers, and well planted with artillery to defend them again&s;t the inva&s;ions of pirates. The monks pay yearly above twenty thou&s;and dollars to the &s;ultan and ba&s;cha, which they rai&s;e by alms, and the liberal contributions of Ru&s;&s;ia and the princes of Mol|davia and Walachia. Macedonia was antiently a kingdom, and &s;ome of its kings were very fa|mous, particularly Alexander the Great, who rai&s;ed his country to the highe&s;t pitch of glory and grandeur, extending his dominions from the Danube to the Indus, and from the Black to the Red Sea.</P>
<P>The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Salonichi, or Salonica, antiently The&s;&s;alonica, and now the metropolis of Macedonia, &s;tands at the bottom of the gulph to which it gives name, called antiently Sinus Thermaicus, two hundred and &s;ixty miles from Con&s;tantinople, and is a place of great trade, large, and well fortified. In the neighbourhood of it, towards the we&s;t, runs the river Verdar. It is extremely populous, but mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are low, and the &s;treets narrow. A Turki&s;h ba&s;ha re&s;ides here, and al&s;o a catholic and Greek archbi&s;hop. There are &s;till remaining
<PB N="135" REF="1390">
many monuments of its antient grandeur, as tri|umphal arches, churches, now converted into mo&s;ques, and antique fragments with in&s;criptions. In the church of St. Demetrius are &s;aid to be above a thou&s;and pillars of ja&s;per, porphyry, &amp;c. The Greeks have here thirty churches, and the Jews thirty-&s;ix large &s;ynagogues, be&s;ides &s;everal &s;maller ones, and two colleges for the education of their youth. St. Paul preached here, and wrote two epi&s;tles to the inhabitants. The trade of the city is carried on chiefly by the Jews. Some &s;ay it had the name of The&s;&s;alonica from The&s;&s;a|lonica, &s;i&s;ter of Alexander the Great, and wife of Ca&s;&s;ander, who rebuilt, or at lea&s;t repaired and enlarged it; but, according to others, from a victory obtained here by Philip, the &s;on of Amyntas, over the The&s;&s;alians.

<HEAD>ALBANIA.</HEAD>
<P>Albania, or Arnaut, comprehends the old Gre|cian Illyricum and Epirus. The fir&s;t of the&s;e is &s;ometimes called Upper-Albania, and the other. Lower-Albania. Upper-Albania is bounded by Epirus on the &s;outh; by Macedonia on the ea&s;t; by the gulph of Venice on the we&s;t; and on the north-ea&s;t and north by a chain of mountains, call|ed Monte-Negro, or the Black-mountains, which divide it from Macedonia, and partly from Servia and Dalmatia. Its greate&s;t length from north to &s;outh is about one hundred and ninety miles, and its breadth from ea&s;t to we&s;t ninety-&s;ix. The &s;oil is fruitful, e&s;pecially towards the north, producing flax, cotton, wood, was, and &s;alt. The inhabi|tants are tall and &s;trong, and make good &s;oldiers, but have &s;carce any notion of learning among them. The two Albanias were the dominions of the famous prince George Ca&s;triot, commonly called Scan|derbeg, who oppo&s;ed for many years the whole Turki&s;h power with a &s;mall army, and gained twenty-two battles over them. It was at la&s;t reduced by Mahomet II. who&s;e &s;ucce&s;&s;ors have held it ever &s;ince. As to religion, the inhabitants are mo&s;tly

The principal towns are,</P>
<P>Scutari, Scudari, or Scodra, on the river Bo|jana, near the lake to which it gives name, eighteen miles from the gulph of Venice to the north-ea&s;t, and &s;eventy-five from Ragu&s;a to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. It is large, well fortified, and was antiently the &s;eat of the kings of Illyricum, as it is now of a beiglerbeg and archbi&s;hop. A con&s;iderable trade is carried on here.</P>
<P>Dolcigno, called by the antients Ulcinium and Olchinium, has a good harbour and a &s;trong ca&s;tle on the Adriatic, twenty miles from Scutari to the &s;outh-we&s;t. Its inhabitants are noted for their piracies.</P>
<P>Durazzo, antiently Epidamnus, and Dyrra|chium, a &s;mall town on the coa&s;t of the gulph of Venice, thirty-five miles from Scutari towards the &s;outh. It has a pretty good harbour and ca&s;tle. Here antiently pa&s;&s;engers u&s;ually embarked for Italy, and landed at Brundu&s;ium; as tho&s;e that were bound to Greece took &s;hipping at the latter, and landed at the former.</P>
<P>Ale&s;&s;io, antiently Ly&s;&s;us, on the river Drino, two miles from its mouth, and &s;ixteen from Scu|tari to the &s;outh. Here the valiant Scanderbeg died and was buried.</P>

It is from the &s;outh-ea&s;t to the north-we&s;t above one hundred miles in length, and from we&s;t to ea&s;t above &s;ixty miles in breadth. The &s;oil is good, e&s;pecially on mount Chimera. The mountains of mo&s;t note are tho&s;e antiently called Acroceraunia-juga and Ceraunii-Montes, from their being often torn by thunder, and mount Pindus. The former divided Lower from Upper Albania, and are now called Chimera; the latter divided it from The&s;&s;aly, and was called Mezzovo, or at lea&s;t the chain of which Pin|dus is a part. The river Achilous, now called A&s;propotamo, A&s;pri, or Catochi, parts it from Achaia. It was to this country that Italy owed its fir&s;t apricots, which, on that account, were called mala Epirotica. It was brought under the Turki&s;h yoke by &s;ultan Amurath II. The places of any note in this country are,</P>
<P>Larta, a large and well peopled town on a bay of the &s;ame name, belonging to the Venetians. The river Achiron, now called Delichi, is &s;aid by &s;ome writers to di&s;charge it&s;elf into the bay of Arta, antiently called Sinus Ambracius.</P>

<HEAD>ACHAIA, now LIVADIA.</HEAD>
<P>Livadia, antiently Achaia, and Hellas, or Greece, properly &s;o called, is bounded on the north by Epirus and The&s;&s;aly, from which it is divided by mount Oeta, now Banina, and by the Euripus, now the &s;traight of Negropont; on the ea&s;t by the Archipelago; on the &s;outh by the gulph of Engia, or Egina, the i&s;thmus of Corinth, and the gulph of Lepanto; and on the we&s;t by the Ionian &s;ea and part of Epirus. Its extent is about one hundred and thirty miles from &s;outh-ea&s;t to north-we&s;t; but its greate&s;t breadth is not above thirty &s;ix miles. It is in general a mountainous country, but neither unplea&s;ant nor unfruitful. The principal mountains are Oeta in Beotia, where is the famous pa&s;s of Thermopyae, not above twenty-five feet broad, and Parna&s;&s;us, Helicon, and Cythaeron in Phocis, which were &s;acred to Apollo and the Mu&s;es, and con&s;equently much celebrated by the poets. The rivers of mo&s;t note are, the Sionapro, antiently the Achelous, the Cephi&s;&s;us, the I&s;menus, and A&s;opus. Liva|dia is at pre&s;ent divided into Livadia, properly &s;o called, Stramulippa, and the duchy of Athens. The mo&s;t remarkable places in it are,</P>
<P>Lepanto, antiently Naupactus, and at pre&s;ent reckoned the capital of Livadia. It &s;tands on that formerly called the gulph of Corinth, and now of Lepanto, oppo&s;ite Patras, in the Morea. It has a &s;mall harbour, and &s;ome trade in leather, oil, tobacco, rice, barley, wheat, and furs. The wine here is the be&s;t in Greece, and the neigh|bouring country extremely plea&s;ant and fertile. To defend the entrance into the gulph there are two ca&s;tles, one on each &s;ide, called the Darda|nelles. The memorable &s;ea-engagement called

<P>Livadia, antiently Libadia, or Lebadia, is now a large populous town on the gulph of Lepanto, twenty-five miles from the city of that name to the ea&s;t. Its trade con&s;i&s;ts in woollen &s;tuffs and rice. In old times it was celebrated for the ora|cle of Trophonius, which was in a cavern in a hill above the town. It now gives name to the pro|vince. Five or &s;ix miles from it to the ea&s;t, is a large lake, to which it al&s;o gives name. The wa|ters of that lake, and the many torrents that fall into it from the mountains, with which it is &s;ur|rounded, have no other outlet but by &s;ubterra|neous pa&s;&s;ages, or channels under the moun|tains.</P>
<P>Setines, antiently the celebrated city of Athens, captial of Attica, though greatly fallen from its antient &s;plendor, is &s;till a con&s;iderable city, con|taining about ten thou&s;and inhabitants, three parts of whom are chri&s;tians. Both within and without the town are many remains of its former gran|deur, which proclaim the great perfection of Athe|nian &s;culpture and architecture. The principal of them are the temples of Jupiter Olympius and Minerva. The la&s;t is now converted into a Turki&s;h mo&s;que, and reckoned the fine&s;t piece of antiquity in the world. This city fell under the dominion of the Turks in the reign of Mahomet II. in 1455. The Greek inhabitants are &s;till di&s;|tingui&s;hed by their &s;agacity and wit, which, as well as the healthine&s;s of the people, is a&s;cribed to the extraordinary goodne&s;s and &s;erenity of the air.

<HEAD>The PELOPONNESUS, or MOREA.</HEAD>
<P>The Peloponne&s;us, or Morea, as it is now called, is a large penin&s;ula, joined to the conti|nent of Greece by the i&s;thmus of Corinth, which, where narrowe&s;t, is not above four or five miles over, and was antiently famed for the I&s;thmian games, celebrated there in honour of Apollo. Its pre&s;ent name of Morea is thought to be derived from morus, a mulberry-tree, on account of the great number of mulberry-trees it produces. It has the gulph of Lepanto on the &s;outh; that of Patras on the north-we&s;t; the lonian &s;ea on the &s;outh-we&s;t; the &s;ea of Candia on the &s;outh; the Aegean &s;ea on the ea&s;t; and the gulph of Engia on the &s;outh-ea&s;t. Its greate&s;t length ea&s;t and we&s;t is one hundred and twenty miles, and its greate&s;t breadth &s;outh and north about on hundred and fifteen. Excepting the mountain|ous parts, it is very fertile, producing corn, wine, oil. and mo&s;t delicious fruits. The chief rivers are the Carban, antiently the Alpheus; the Pirnaza, antiently the Pani&s;us; the Eurotas, now called Ba&s;ilipotamo, i. e. the king's river; and the Inachus, now Planizza. Here al&s;o is the
<PB N="144" REF="1480">
brook or river of Styx, which the poets, on ac|count of the remarkable coldne&s;s of its waters, and other qualities, made one of the rivers of hell. It flows from a lake antiently called Phi|neus. Another remarkable lake is that formerly called Stymphalis, noted for the many ravenous birds that frequented it. The Morea is divided into four di&s;tricts, viz. Saccania, or Romania Minor, Braccio de Mania, or Tzakonia, Belve|dere, and Chiarenza, or Clarenza. The mo&s;t noted mountains are Cyllene, Arcadia, the highe&s;t in all Peloponne&s;us; Menalus, al&s;o in Arcadia; and Nonacris, according to Pliny; Minthe, now Olino; and Taygetus, con&s;i&s;ting of three ridges, at the foot of one of which &s;tood Sparta. In the year 1715, the Turks made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the whole Morea, expelling the Venetians, and have ever &s;ince been in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P>Corinth, or Corinto, by the Turks called Ge|reme, antiently one of the fine&s;t cities of Greece, &s;tands within the i&s;thmus, near that called the bay of Corinth, which is part of the gulph of Lepanto. It looks now much more like a village than a town or city, yet is the &s;ee of a Greek archbi&s;hop. A mile from the town to the &s;outh|ward, on a high craggy hill, &s;tands the ca&s;tle, who&s;e walls are about two miles in compa&s;s, and from which there is one of the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in the world; for on the right-hand one beholds the Saronic gulph, or gulph of Egina, with all the little i&s;lands &s;trewed up and down within it, and &s;ome of tho&s;e of the Archipelago: on the left-hand appear the gulph of Lepanto, or Corinth, with a range of mountains to the north of it, and the i&s;thmus to the &s;outh, as far as Athens. That called Corinthian bra&s;s is &s;aid to have been pro|duced by the melting and mixing of a va&s;t num|ber
<PB N="145" REF="1490">
of &s;tatues and images of gold, &s;ilver, and bra&s;s, when the city was burnt down by the Ro|man general A. Luc. Mummius. The &s;ingular decorations of the pillars, cornices, and pede&s;tals, in its antient &s;tately edifices, gave ri&s;e to the ap|pellation of the Corinthian order. There were many chri&s;tians here in St. Paul's time, as ap|pears from the epi&s;tles addre&s;&s;ed to them by that apo&s;tle. Incontinency was &s;o much in vogue, and pro&s;titutes &s;o much e&s;teemed in it formerly, that not only marks of honour and re&s;pect were be&s;towed on them, but public prayers were offered to Venus for their pre&s;ervation and increa&s;e. Its pre&s;ent low &s;tate is partly owing to its being &s;o much expo&s;ed to the de&s;cents of the Cor&s;ans. In con&s;equence of its &s;ituation betwixt the Ionian and Aegean &s;eas, on each of which it had a har|bour, and from which it derived the epithet of Bimaris, it antiently carried on a va&s;t trade, and became very rich and powerful, and at the &s;ame time, as u&s;ual, luxurious, di&s;&s;olute, proud, and in&s;olent; whereby, at la&s;t, its grandeur was laid in the du&s;t.</P>

It is the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, and has a ca&s;tle. Here was antiently a temple dedicated to Diana, with an altar on which hu|man &s;acrifices u&s;ed to be offered. The whole number of the inhabitants, Turks, Jews, and Greeks, is &s;aid to be about four or five thou&s;and &s;ouls.

<HEAD>CORFU,</HEAD>
<P>Antiently called Phaeacia and Corcyra, lies near the mouth of the Adriatic-&s;ea, on the coa&s;t of Albania. It is about one hundred and twenty miles in circumference, and to take its pre&s;ent name from the antient ca&s;tle of Corypho, which was &s;o called from its being built on a &s;harp pointed hill, &s;tyled in Greek <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. It is a very healthy and well inhabited i&s;land, containing two cities, and above one hundred villages, &s;ome of them pretty large, populous, and wealthy. The &s;oil is not the &s;ame all over the i&s;land, the &s;outhern part being barren, mountainous, and de&s;titute of water; but the northern very fertile in all kinds of delicious fruits, excellent wine, grain, olives, &amp;c. Its two cities are Corfu and Ca&s;|&s;opo, which is the Ca&s;&s;iope of the antients. The Venetians have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it ever &s;ince the year 1386; and as it is e&s;teemed the key of the Adriatic, they con&s;tantly keep a fleet of gal|lies and other &s;hips in the harbour of Corfu, which is one of the &s;tronge&s;t places on all the&s;e coa&s;ts.

The i&s;land furni&s;hes Venice with va&s;t quantities of &s;alt and cedar, be&s;ides its other pro|duce. It is governed, like the other i&s;lands &s;ubject to Venice, by a balio, proveditore, capitano, and ca&s;tellano, who are noble Venetians; as is al&s;o the archbi&s;hop, who is primate and metropolitan of all the&s;e i&s;lands.

<HEAD>CEPHALONIA</HEAD>
<P>By mo&s;t geographers is &s;aid to be larger than Corfu, being about one hundred and thirty, or one hundred and forty miles in circumference. It is very fruitful in red wines, Mu&s;cadel grapes, currants, oil, citrons, oranges, pomegranates, and grain; and abounds in a variety of rare me|dicinal plants and flowers, from which they pre|pare &s;everal liquors of the fine&s;t flavour. Mo&s;t of the trees bear twice a year, namely in April and November. The principal places in it are Cephalonia, Argo&s;toli, and A&s;&s;o. The fir&s;t is the capital, and a bi&s;hop's &s;ee; the &s;econd is the principal port of the i&s;land, and the re&s;idence of the proveditore, or governor; and the third a &s;trong &s;ortre&s;s.

<HEAD>ZANTE,</HEAD>
<P>Formerly called Zacynthus, lies about twelves miles &s;outh of Cephalonia. It is reckoned about fifty miles in circumference, and to contain above fifty thou&s;and inhabitants. Zante, the capital, is &s;aid to have about twenty-five thou&s;and &s;ouls. The i&s;land is very &s;ubject to earth|quakes, and almo&s;t every where environed with mountains. It produces plenty of &s;trong wines, currants, melons, rai&s;ins, oil, figs, and corn, with which and &s;alt a great trade is carried on. The inhabitants are mo&s;tly Greeks. The Engli&s;h and Dutch have a factory and con&s;ul here. Rai&s;ins and currants are very fine and cheap in this i&s;land, and great quantities of them are exported, e&s;pecially to England. The me|lons and peaches al&s;o are in high reque&s;t, of a prodigious bigne&s;s, and exqui&s;ite flavour. All &s;hips coming from the Levant perform quarantine at this i&s;land, as well as at Venice. Near Chiari, a &s;ea-port town, are two &s;prings of fre&s;h and clear water, which throw up pieces of real pitch. The people are &s;aid to get about one hundred barrels of it one year with another, which they u&s;e to pay their &s;hips and other ve&s;&s;els with.

<HEAD>CANDIA,</HEAD>
<P>Called antiently Crete and Hecatompolis from its hundred cities, is one of the large&s;t i&s;lands in the Mediterranean, being about two hundred miles long and &s;ixty broad. Its &s;ituation is very advantageous, lying about fifty miles from Cape St. Angelo in the Morea, and about four hundred from Egypt and Natolia, or the Le&s;&s;er A&s;ia. The air was &s;o whole&s;ome and temperate, that it was formerly on that account called Macarone&s;us, i. e. the Fortunate I&s;land; but the &s;outh wind is now &s;aid to be dangerous, and often &s;uffocates people in the open air. As to the &s;oil, a great part of it is barren, rocky, and mountainous; but the vil|lages are full of vine-trees, olivet-rees myrtles, laurels, oranges, lemons, intermingled with other fruits, and corn fields. Al&s;o &s;ilk, wool, honey, and wax, abound here; as well as game, wild fowl, and tame animals of all kinds: but there are no &s;tags, rabbits, or wild bea&s;ts. Their wines, both red and white, are of an exqui&s;ite flavour. The inhabitants are a mixture of Turks, Greeks, Jews, and Armenians; but a great part of the country lies wa&s;te. There are no con&s;iderable rivers in the i&s;land; Lethe is one of the large&s;t &s;treams. Above half the i&s;land is taken up with
<PB N="153" REF="1570">
barren mountains, the large&s;t of which is mount Ida, covered a great part of the year with &s;now. The only thing it produces is the tragacantha, or buck|thorn, famous for its gum. The quince-tree was originally brought from Cydonia, in this i&s;land, to Italy, and, on that account, was called by the Romans Malus Cydonia. Crete was once a king|dom, and Minos one of its mo&s;t celebrated kings and lawgivers. The antient Cretans were very expert at the bow and &s;ling; and even tho&s;e of the pre&s;ent times are &s;aid to be very fond of archery. As to morals, they had but a very indifferent character in former times. St. Paul quotes this pa&s;&s;age from one of their own poets: "The Cre|tans are always liars, evil bea&s;ts, and &s;low bellies." They are &s;tigmatized by other authors for their la&s;civiou&s;ne&s;s, and their want of honour and pro|bity. The pre&s;ent race, as Mr. Tournefort in|forms us, are not quite &s;o bad: he &s;ays there are no beggars, pickpockets, cut-throats, nor robbers in the i&s;land; but that the Turks there are mo&s;tly renegadoes, a profligate &s;et of men, who get nothing more in exchange for their religion than the privilege of wearing a ve&s;t, and of be|ing exempt from the capitation-tax, which is not above five crowns a-year. In 1644 the Turks made a de&s;cent here; and after be&s;ieging Candia the capital twenty years, reduced the whole i&s;land, except a few forts, which were afterwards taken. They have ever &s;ince been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and govern it by a beiglerbeg. We now proceed to de&s;cribe the principal places.</P>
<P>Candia, the capital, &s;tanding on the ruins of He|raclea, &s;uppo&s;ed to be the &s;ame with Matium, is &s;ituated on a bay of the &s;ea, about the middle of the north &s;ide of the i&s;land. It &s;uffered &s;o much by the long &s;iege in the la&s;t century, that it is now little better than a de&s;ert, excepting the
<PB N="154" REF="1580">
market-place, and a few &s;treets about it, where the principal inhabitants live. In the time of the Venetians it was well peopled, flouri&s;hing in trade, and very &s;trong. It had once a good har|bour, but it is now almo&s;t choaked up, and only navigable for boats. With regard to the above|mentioned &s;iege, the Turks inve&s;ted the town in the beginning of the year 1645; the garri&s;on held out till the latter end of September 1669, and &s;urrendered at la&s;t upon honourable terms, after they had been &s;tormed fifty-&s;ix times. The Venetians lo&s;t upwards of eighty thou&s;and men, and the Turks above one hundred and eighty thou&s;and, during the &s;iege. The inhabitants now con&s;i&s;t of Greeks, who have an archbi&s;hop, Jews, Turks, Armenians, and a few French families, with a vice-con&s;ul, and &s;ome capuchin friars. The Turks are mo&s;tly &s;oldiers of the garri&s;on. About five or &s;ix miles from this city, towards the &s;outh, lies Mount Ida, now called P&s;ilonti, and at the foot of it a little hill, in which is the famous labyrinth, which &s;eems to be a work of nature, and only a va&s;t &s;ubterraneous cavern, branching out into a thou&s;and intricate windings. When travellers vi&s;it it, they always provide them&s;elves with guides and torches, otherwi&s;e they would be in great danger of lo&s;ing their way. The place is quite dry; not the lea&s;t water-fall, congelation, nor drain to be &s;een. Tho' this is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be the antient Cretan laby|rinth, yet it is far from being &s;atisfactorily proved.</P>
<P>Canea, a pretty good town, &s;tanding, as is ge|nerally &s;uppo&s;ed, on the ruins of the antient Cy|donia, and on the northern coa&s;t.

The Scattered I&s;lands. Of the mo&s;t remarkable in the&s;e divi&s;ions, and al&s;o of Cyprus and Rhodes, we &s;hall here give a &s;hort account, be|ginning with the Cyclades, which lie between Can|dia on the &s;outh and Negropont on the north.</P>
<P>Policandro, lying about twelve miles from San|torini towards the north-we&s;t, is a &s;mall rocky i&s;land, about eight miles in compa&s;s. All the in|habitants live in a village three miles from the &s;ea-&s;ide, in which are two convents and three well built churches. From the ca&s;tle, which &s;tands on a high-hill, one may &s;ee all the i&s;les of the Archipelago. The produce of the i&s;land is barley, cotton, &s;heep, and fowls; and its manufactures, bread, &s;tuffs, and chee&s;e. Both men and women are &s;aid to be courteous to &s;trangers, e&s;pecially the latter, who are very hand&s;ome.</P>
<P>Milo, antiently Melos, a &s;mall i&s;land, about &s;ixty miles in compa&s;s, but well peopled and cul|tivated, with one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t commo|dious havens in the Mediterranean. It is every where mountainous, except a fine plain of &s;ix or &s;even miles in length, in the mid&s;t of which is the city of Mello, or Milo, the capital of the i&s;land. Both the Latins and Greeks have a bi&s;hop and ca|thedral here; but the numbers of the former bear
<PB N="158" REF="1620">
no proportion to that of the latter. A great part of the i&s;land may be compared to a &s;pongy, po|rous rock, impregnated with iron, alum, and &s;ul|phur, which being heated by the friction of the &s;ea-water, occa&s;ion tho&s;e violent earthquakes to which it is &s;ubject. On the coa&s;t are many grot|tos or caves incru&s;ted with a variety of &s;alts of different colours, and others &s;o full of &s;ulphur, and &s;o hot, that there is no entering them. The iron mines here are very advantageous, and the &s;oil very fertile, yielding plenty of grain, exqui|&s;ite fruits, e&s;pecially grapes, melons, and figs; with honey, fle&s;h, fowl, game, and fi&s;h: but the air is none of the mo&s;t whole&s;ome.

There are &s;ome good roads and harbours in it, &s;everal vil|lages, a great many churches and chapels, and no le&s;s than &s;ixteen mona&s;teries. The chief town is Parechia, built on the ruins of the antient Paros, in the walls of which are fine marble columns ly|ing at length; and all over the town are architraves, pede&s;tals, and other exqui&s;ite pieces of carved mar|ble, the remains of antient Paros. This i&s;land was formerly dedicated to Bacchus on account of the excellent wines it produced. Every one knows how famous the white Parian marble was of old, and tho&s;e inimitable &s;tatuaries, Phidias and Praxi|tiles, who were natives of this i&s;le, and who gave life, in a manner, to all the &s;tatues they wrought, &s;ome of which became the objects of divine wor|&s;hip.

It yields al&s;o wine, oil, &s;ilk, barley, and &s;ome wheat. Be&s;ides a town of the &s;ame name with the i&s;land, there are twenty-&s;ix villages, two of which are inhabited by Albanians. Port Gau|rio is the be&s;t in the whole i&s;le. The inhabitants are all of the Greek per&s;ua&s;ion.</P>
<P>Zia, or Zea, the antient Ceos, or Cos, lying to the &s;outh-we&s;t of Andros, takes its name from the ruins of a &s;mall town which &s;tands near the remains of the antient Carthaea. The harbour lies to the north-we&s;t, and is capable of receiving the large&s;t &s;hips. The i&s;land is fruitful and well cultivated, abounding in barley, wine, &s;ilk, cat|tle, and velani, which is the fruit of a &s;pecies of oak, much u&s;ed by dyers and tanners. It yields al&s;o lead like that of Siphanto, and chalk like that of Briancon in Dauphine. The ruins of other cities be&s;ides tho&s;e of Carthaea are &s;till vi|&s;ible here. The Greeks have many churches and chapels, and &s;everal mona&s;teries in this i&s;le.</P>
<P>Joura, antiently Gyarus, Gyara, or Gyarae, is a barren de&s;olate i&s;le, lying to the ea&s;t of Zea, and about twelve miles in compa&s;s. Hither the Romans u&s;ed to bani&s;h delinquents.</P>
<P>Thermia, antiently Cythnus, Ophiu&s;a, and Dryopis, lies to the &s;outh-ea&s;t of Zea. Its &s;oil is very good, yielding barley, wine, honey, figs, wax, &s;ilk, with &s;ome wheat and cotton, but hardly any cil. There are two villages in it, one of

which gives name to the i&s;land. Both contain about &s;ixteen thou&s;and &s;ouls, all of the Greek re|ligion, except about a dozen Latin families, &s;e|veral mona&s;teries, and a great many churches and chapels. There are al&s;o two good harbours in the i&s;land, with many hot &s;prings, from which it had the name of Thermia.</P>
<P>The i&s;lands de&s;cribed above are the chief of the Cyclades. Of the others the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble are the following:</P>
<P>Engia, or rather Aegina, antiently Oeone and Myrmidonia, lies in the gulph to which it gives name, antiently called Sinus Saronicus, from the river Saron, about ten miles from the coa&s;t of the Morea. It is about thirty miles in circumference, and fruitful in corn, cotton, honey, wax, and al|monds; but has no harbours, and only one half|ruined town, which gives name to the i&s;land. From its ca&s;tle, which &s;tands high, is a very beautiful pro&s;pect. Its antient inhabitants were &s;o indu&s;trious, that they were &s;tiled myrmidons, i. e. ants.</P>
<P>Colouri, antiently Salamis, lies towards the bottom of the gulph of Engia, about a mile from the promontory of Attica, called Amphiala. It is about fifty miles in compa&s;s, and has a &s;pacious harbour on the we&s;t &s;ide. Of the three villages in it, one is called Colouri and gives name to the i&s;land. Near the ancient city of Salamus, The|mi&s;tocles obtained a great victory over the Per|&s;ians. There is another &s;mall i&s;land in the gulph, now called Porus, and antiently Calabraea. It is about eighteen miles in compa&s;s, and inhabited by Albanians. It was to this i&s;le that the great orator Demo&s;thenes was bani&s;hed. The gulph of Aegina, in which the&s;e i&s;les lie, is &s;aid to be thirty-&s;ix miles broad at its mouth, and &s;ixty in depth of length.</P>

Negropont, antiently Euboea, &s;tretches along the ea&s;tern coa&s;t of Achaia or Livadia, from which it is &s;eparated by a narrow channel, called the Euripus. It is about ninety miles long, and twenty-five broad in the wide&s;t part, producing corn, wine, oil, fruit and cattle in great abundance. It is thought to have been formerly joined to the con|tinent of Greece by an i&s;thmus, as it is now by a bridge near the capital. The Turks made them|&s;elves ma&s;ters of this i&s;land in the year 1470, un|der &s;ultan Mahomet II. The tides in the Euripus are &s;ometimes regular, and at others irregular, according to the age of the moon. From the three la&s;t days of the old moon to the eighth day of the new moon, and from the fourteenth to the twentieth inclu&s;ively, they are regular; but on the other days they are irregular, flowing twelve, thirteen, or fourteen times in twenty-four hours, and ebbing as often. The only places in the i&s;land worth our notice are, Negropont and Ca&s;tel Ro&s;&s;o. The fir&s;t, called by the Greeks Egripos, &s;tands on the &s;outh-we&s;t coa&s;t of the i&s;land, and the narrow|e&s;t part of the &s;trait, near where Chalcis was an|tiently &s;ituate. The town is walled and inhabited only by Turks and Jews, who, with the chri&s;tians in the &s;uburbs, are &s;aid to amount to about fifteen thou&s;and; but the chri&s;tians are much more nu|merous than the infidels. The captain-ba&s;&s;a, or admiral of Turkey, who is al&s;o governor of the city, the i&s;land, and the adjacent continent of Greece, re&s;ides here; and the harbour, which is very &s;afe and &s;pacious, is &s;eldom without a fleet of gallies, ready to put to &s;ea again&s;t the pirates and the Malte&s;e.

Ca&s;tel Ro&s;&s;o, antiently called Cary&s;tus, or Ca|ry&s;te, is a con&s;iderable city, with a good harbour at the foot of Mount Oche, fifty-five miles from Negropont to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. A little to the north-ea&s;t of it, is the cape antiently called Ca|phareum, and now Capo Figarea, which is &s;o &s;ur|rounded with rocks that it is dangerous for &s;hips to come near it. The mo&s;t &s;outhern point of this i&s;land is called Capo d'Oro, or Capo Chimi.</P>
<P>Scyro, antiently Scyros, lies about twenty-five miles from Negropont towards the north-ea&s;t, and was &s;o named from its barren rugged rocks. It is about &s;ixty miles in circumference, having a little town of the &s;ame name with it, a &s;afe harbour, &s;everal villages, and &s;ome quar|ries of marble. Pallas was antiently patrone&s;s of this i&s;land, and had a magnificent temple in it.</P>
<P>Stalimene, antiently Lemnos, lies in the north part of the Aegean &s;ea, over-again&s;t the &s;trait of the Dardanelles. It is of a &s;quare form, and each &s;ide about twenty-five miles. Here is plenty of corn and wine; but the commodity for which the i&s;land is mo&s;t noted, is the mineral earth called <HI>terra lemnia,</HI> and <HI>terra &s;igillata,</HI> from a &s;eal the Turks put upon every piece that is &s;old to fo|reigners; it is &s;aid to have great virtues in heal|ing wounds, expelling poi&s;ons, &s;topping fluxes, &amp;c. It is found in a particular mountain. A certain quantity is dug up every year, and put into hair-bags, &s;ome of which are &s;ent to the grand &s;ignior, and the re&s;t marked with his &s;eal, or with the&s;e two words, <HI>tin imachton,</HI> that is, the &s;ealed earth, and &s;old by the &s;angiack, or his deputy, to the inhabitants and foreign merchants.

The i&s;land was heretofore &s;acred to Vulcan, whom the inhabitants wor&s;hipped as their patron. According to the poets he fell into it when he was kicked out of heaven by Juno for a deformed brat, and was lamed in his fall, whence he was called Limnius. There are two high mountains here that are volcanos, and probably gave occa&s;ion to the fable and wor&s;hip of Vulcan.</P>
<P>Samondrachi, antiently Samothrace, i. e. the country of the Thracians, lies not far from the coa&s;t of Romania, to the north of Lemnos. It is about twenty miles in circuit, and pretty well cultivated. The town, of the &s;ame name with the i&s;land, &s;tands on a high mountain command|ing a pro&s;pect of its &s;pacious harbour. Certain deities, called Cabiri, were held in high venera|tion here in antient times.</P>

<P>Tha&s;&s;us, or Tha&s;os, a &s;mall i&s;land to the we&s;t of Samondrachi, in the gulph of Conte&s;&s;a. There is a &s;mall town of the &s;ame name with the i&s;land on the north &s;ide of it. Here is excellent wine and marble, and antiently there were rich gold mines.</P>
<P>Macroni&s;i, that is, the Long I&s;land, lies be|tween Joura and Zea. It is barren and uninha|bited, and was antiently called Helena, Macris, and Cranae.</P>

The Turks call it now Bo&s;|chiada, or Bo&s;chiada&s;i, i. e. the barren i&s;land. It is indeed very rocky, but contains many val|leys, with one pretty large town of the &s;ame name with this i&s;land, inhabited mo&s;tly by Greeks, and having a harbour defended by two ca&s;tles. It was behind this i&s;land that the Greeks retired, when they made a feint of abandoning the &s;iege of

They pretend here to &s;hew the tombs of Marpe&s;ia, queen of the Amazons, and of that renowned hero Achil|les. The Mu&s;cadine wines produced here are greatly extolled.</P>
<P>Le&s;bos, or Mytilene, now called by the Greeks Metelin, and Metelino, is a large i&s;land, &s;outh|ward of Tenedos, over-again&s;t the coa&s;t of Ly|dia. It is but thinly inhabited, though in gene|ral pretty fruitful, producing plenty of corn, wine, fruit, e&s;pecially the be&s;t figs in the Archipe|lago, and abounding in cattle, and a breed of &s;mall, but &s;trong, &s;wift hor&s;es. Several of the mountains are covered with pines and other trees. There are about ten thou&s;and Turks, and twice as many Greeks, on the i&s;land.</P>
<P>Ca&s;tro, or Ca&s;tri, the capital, antiently Myti|lene, is &s;ituate on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the i&s;land, and hath an excellent harbour, defended by a &s;trong ca&s;tle, in which is kept a con&s;tant garri&s;on. In many parts of the i&s;land are &s;till to be &s;een broken columns, chapiters, ba&s;es, friezes, &amp;c. of the fine&s;t marble, curiou&s;ly wrought, and inter&s;per&s;ed with in&s;criptions. There are &s;everal other good harbours and creeks in the i&s;land, be&s;ides that of Ca&s;tro; but they are mo&s;tly haunted by the pi|rates that infe&s;t tho&s;e &s;eas, notwith&s;tanding there are gallies continually crui&s;ing again&s;t them. The chief trade of the i&s;land is in grain, wine, fruits, butter, chee&s;e, and pitch. The tribute paid yearly to the grand &s;ignior is computed at eighteen thou&s;and pia&s;tres. The inhabitants are &s;o fleeced by their Turki&s;h ma&s;ters, that they are generally poor, and their hou&s;es low and meanly built.

<P>Chios, now Scio, and by the Turks Saki-&s;a|duci, &s;aid, among other places, to have given birth to Homer, lies to the &s;outh of Le&s;bos, over|again&s;t the coa&s;t of Ionia, and in the &s;ame lati|tude with Smyrna. It is about one hundred miles in circumference, and though mo&s;tly mountain|ous and &s;toney, is &s;aid to be very populous, and to produce plenty of corn, wine, oil, honey, fruits of all &s;orts, variety of gums, e&s;pecially that called ma&s;tich, which i&s;&s;ues from the lenti&s;k-tree, and yields a va&s;t profit to the inhabitants. The ma|nufactures are chiefly tho&s;e of &s;ilk. The Greeks are &s;aid to enjoy greater privileges here than any where el&s;e in the grand &s;iegnior's dominions, and to be generally rich, and remarkably gay and merry. The women too are counted very hand&s;ome, witty, and extremely good-natured. The town of Scio is about two miles in circuit, adorned with plea&s;ant gardens and orchards, neat hou&s;es, churches, and mona&s;teries, but is neither light&s;ome, nor well paved. The port, though none of the be&s;t, is the rendezvous of all the &s;hips that &s;ail to Con&s;tantinople, or go from thence to Syria, Aegypt, &amp;c.

The Turks in the i&s;land are computed at ten thou&s;and, the Latins at two thou&s;and, and the Greeks at near one hundred thou&s;and. It is &s;aid to pay to the grand &s;ignior double tribute of any other in the Archi-Pelago. Near the town of Scio is a mona&s;tery of Greek monks or caloyers, who&s;e revenue is &s;aid to amount to fifty thou&s;and crowns a-year, out of which they pay five hundred per annum capita|tion tax. The Turks look upon the Sciots as a fool|i&s;h kind of people, and it is a common &s;aying among them, that it is as impo&s;&s;ible to find a wi&s;e Sciot as a green hor&s;e. The Sciots are &s;aid to have been taught the culture of the vine by Oenepion, the &s;on of Bacchus. Virgil and Horace mention the red wine made here as the be&s;t in Greece. The wine mo&s;t e&s;teemed is that of Me&s;ta, whence the antients had their nectar. The inhabitants of the fir&s;t rank pay ten crowns a-head per annum to the Porte, the next three crowns, and the mean|e&s;t people two and a half. In this i&s;le, were born Ion the tragic poet, Theopompus the hi&s;torian, and Theocritus the &s;ophi&s;t.

The mo|na&s;tery of St. John in the i&s;le is a kind of citadel, built on the top of a high rock, and &s;urrounded with &s;tout walls, and high irregular towers. The building called the hermitage of the Apocalyp&s;e, depending on the convent, has a very mean ap|pearance. It is &s;ituated al&s;o on a rock, between the mona&s;tery and port de la Scala. On the left of it is the grotto of St. John, the entrance of which is about &s;even feet high, with a &s;quare pillar in the middle. On the top they &s;hew a cleft in the &s;olid rock, thro' which they tell you the Holy Gho&s;t dictated the Revelations that St. John wrote during his bani&s;hment, which happened in the reign of Domitian in the year 95. The monks in the mona&s;tery of St. John are about one hundred in number, who have a revenue of &s;ix thou&s;and crowns per annum.

The knights of St. John of Jeru&s;alem were a long time ma&s;ters of this i&s;land, namely, from the year 1308 till the year 1523, when the Turks under Solyman the Magnificent reduced it, and obliged the knights to retire to Malta.

It is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to have obtained the name of Cyprus, from the great number of Cyprus trees in it; but by others from the Greek word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, copper, on account of &s;ome mines it had formerly of that metal. Richard I. king of England, made a conque&s;t of this i&s;le, ann. 1101, in his way to the Holy Land, and gave the royalty of it to Guy of Lu&s;ignan, then titular king of Jeru&s;alem. The Venetians po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of it anno 1480; but were di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed about the middle of the 16th century by the Turks, under who&s;e yoke it hath ever &s;ince groaned. The air is exce&s;&s;ive hot and &s;ultry in &s;ummer, in&s;omuch that it &s;ometimes dries up all the &s;prings. At that &s;ea&s;on al&s;o the country is much infe&s;ted with lo|cu&s;ts, which &s;ometimes devour all their corn and fruit. The &s;oil, where duly cultivated, is very fruitful, producing corn, wine, oil, cotton, wool, &s;ilk, and a great variety of gaine. There is a bird, about the &s;ize of a lark, of which great quantities are caught, e&s;pecially in the months of September and October. Some thou&s;and bar|rels of the&s;e, pickled with vinegar and &s;alt, are &s;ent every year to Venice, and &s;old for ready money. Their be&s;t wines are produced at the foot of mount Olympus. They had formerly &s;ugar-canes, but they have been all de&s;troyed by the Turks. There are no con&s;iderable rivers in the i&s;land. Of its mountains the mo&s;t noted is Olympus, which is of an extraordinary height and extent. Their manufactures are chiefly tho&s;e of wool,

While Cyprus was in the hands of the Chri&s;tians it was well peopled, having eight hundred or one thou&s;and villages; but it is &s;o thinly inhabited at pre&s;ent, that half the lands lie uncultivated. The pre&s;ent inhabitants are Turks, Jews, Greeks, Armenians, with &s;ome few Latin Chri&s;tians, Cophts, Maronites, and Ne&s;torians, who have all the free exerci&s;e of their religion, and their &s;eparate churches. Chri&s;tia|nity was planted here by St. Paul, and his con|&s;tant companion Barnabas. The la&s;t of the&s;e is &s;aid to have been a native of the i&s;land, as al&s;o the famed poet A&s;clepiades, the philo&s;ophers Zeno, Apollonius, Xenophon, Epiphanius, bi&s;hop of Salamis, and other great men. The i&s;land was antiently dedicated to Venus, from thence called Venus Cypria, and Dea Cypri. The inha|bitants, like the deity they wor&s;hipped, are re|pre&s;ented as having been very lewd and la&s;civious; in&s;omuch that the women e&s;teemed it an act of religion to pro&s;titute them&s;elves to foreigners. The government of Cyprus at pre&s;ent is ve&s;ted in a beiglerbeg, who has under him five &s;angiacs, forty ziamets, and one thou&s;and &s;ixty-&s;even tima|riots.

the northern or &s;outhern &s;ituation of the&s;e parts, partly from their proximity or di&s;tance from the &s;ea, and partly from the nature of the &s;oil and ex|ternal figure. In general, in the middle of the country, the weather is &s;ettled, temperate, and &s;erene; in the north it is colder, more variable, and boi&s;terous; and in the &s;outh much warmer, e&s;pecially in winter. As the air, &s;o the &s;oil dif|fers exceedingly. In the north it is generally barren, producing but little corn or fruit; but the countries watered by the Rhine, Neckar, and Danube, are fruitful, and produce plenty both of corn and wine. Saxony is al&s;o a delicious coun|try and a rich &s;oil. So great is the extent of Ger|many, and &s;o various the &s;oil, that there are very few vegetables, minerals, metals, or animals, that may not be found in &s;ome part or other of it. It yields grain of all kinds, as common wheat, Tur|key-wheat, buck-wheat, rye, &s;pelt, barley, oats, peas, beans, vetches, lentils, chiches, millet; be|&s;ides manna, hemp, flax, hops, ani&s;e, cummin, tobacco, madder, woad, &s;affron, carthamus, or ba&s;tard-&s;affron, acorns, truffles, and potatoes, with a variety of other excellent roots, medicinal and pot-herbs. As to fruits, it produces apples, pears, cherries, plumbs, che&s;nuts, almonds, olives, medlars, figs, peaches, apricots, oranges, lemons, citrons, filberts, nuts, walnuts, together with wine, of which the Rheni&s;h and Mo&s;elle, the Franconian, Neckar, Kocher, and Mu&s;cadel wines are the be&s;t. In Au&s;tria too grows an ex|cellent wine. Germany abounds al&s;o with honey, butter, and chee&s;e, hor&s;es, oxen, cows, &s;heep, and goats. Of wild and tame fowls there is al&s;o great plenty and variety, &s;uch as turkeys, pi|geons, gee&s;e, and ducks, &s;torks, &s;poonbills, wild gee&s;e, wild ducks, &s;wans, bu&s;tards, phea&s;ants, woodcocks, partridges, grou&s;e, &s;nipes, larks,

<P>The principal mountains are tho&s;e of the Alps, which divide Germany from Italy; but there are many chains and &s;ingle mountains in other parts of the country, though inferior to the&s;e. In &s;everal of the mountains are remarkable caverns, grottos, and cavities, in which are found a great variety of figures of drop-&s;tone, or petrified water. The chief rivers of Germany are, 1. The Danube, called antiently I&s;ter, which ri&s;es in the Black Fore&s;t in Suabia, runs through Suabia and Bavaria to Ra|ti&s;bon, then to Vienna, and after dividing Hun|gary into two parts, continues its cour&s;e &s;outh|ea&s;t to Belgrade in Servia, proceeding &s;till ea&s;t through Turkey, it falls at la&s;t into the Euxine or Black Sea by &s;everal channels; being &s;o wide and deep from Vienna to Belgrade, that fleets of men of war have engaged on it. There are &s;everal whirlpools and cataracts in it, particularly in its pa&s;&s;age through Turkey, which interrupt the na|vigation to the Black Sea. It runs a cour&s;e of two thou&s;and miles or thereabouts, taking in all its windings. The rivers which fall into it on the &s;outh &s;ide are the Iller, or I&s;er, the Leck, an|other I&s;er, which falls into it oppo&s;ite Decken|dorf, the Inn, the Ens, the Drave, the Save, and the Morava. On the north, the Regen, the Neb, the They&s;&s;e, the Alauta, and the Pruth. The hau&s;en, in Latin <HI>antaceus,</HI> the large&s;t kind of river-fi&s;h, is taken in the Danube. 2. The Rhine, which ri&s;es in the country of the Gri&s;ons, and runs north to the lake of Con&s;tance, then we&s;t to Ba&s;il, afterwards north between Suabia and Al|&s;ace;

then pa&s;&s;ing through the Palatinate, the electorate of Cologn, and the dutchy of Cleve, at la&s;t enters the Netherlands, five miles below Cleve, where it is very broad and &s;wift; but the navigation of it is interrupted by &s;everal cataracts, one particularly at Shaffhau&s;en in Switzerland, where the whole river falls &s;eventy-five &s;eet. Its cour&s;e, including windings, is about &s;ix hundred miles. Its fi&s;h are &s;turgeon, two &s;orts of lampreys, the prickly pike, the Rhine carp, and the barbel. Chry&s;tal i$ found in it &s;ometimes, and al&s;o parti|cles of gold. The rivers which fall into it are the Neckar, the Maine, the Lhon, the Roer, and the Lippe. It is generally one quarter, and in &s;ome places half a mile broad, and from one and a half to &s;ix or &s;even fathoms deep. It is naviga|ble for four hundred miles to Ba&s;il in Switzerland. Pa&s;&s;engers are carried on it at the rate of five or &s;ix miles for a penny. 3. The Elbe ri&s;es on the con|fines of Sile&s;ia, runs north-we&s;t through Bohemia, Saxony, and Brandenburg, and then, dividing the king of Great Britain's German dominions from Hol&s;tein-falls into the German-&s;ea, about &s;eventy miles below Hamburgh, receiving in its pa&s;&s;age the Moldau, the Egar, the Sala, the Havel, the Il-menau, and the Stor. It brings &s;hips of good burden up to Hamburgh with the flood, e&s;pecially if the wind is we&s;terly, and within a mile of it at low-water. Its fi&s;h are &s;almon, &s;turgeon, carp, roach, bream, and alander, with many others. The tide runs in it ten miles above Hamburgh, where &s;hips of four hundred tons and upwards ride at anchor. 4. The Oder runs from &s;outh to north through Sile&s;ia and Brandenburgh; then pa&s;&s;ing by Stetin, and dividing Ea&s;tern from We&s;tern Po|merania, falls at la&s;t into the Baltic, between the i&s;lands of U&s;edom and Wollin. In this river are many &s;and-banks which interrupt its navigation.
<PB N="185" REF="1900">
Among its fi&s;h are &s;almon and &s;turgeon. Canals are cut between this river and the Elbe, which very much promote the trade of the electorate of Brandenburg. It runs a cour&s;e of about three hundred miles. 5. The We&s;er ri&s;es in the moun|tains of Thuringen, runs through He&s;&s;e and We&s;tphalia, and falls into the ocean forty miles below Bremen. It runs about two hundred and fifty miles, and abounds in fi&s;h. Large &s;hips loaded cannot come further than Brake or El&s;|fleth, about fourteen miles below Bremen. The other rivers of any note are, the Spree, the Pene, the Ems, the Mo&s;elle, and the Saar. There are al&s;o in Germany many &s;mall and great inland lakes, as that of Con&s;tance and Bregenz, between Sua|bia and Switzerland; Chiem&s;ee, or the lake of Ba|varia; the Zerknitzer-&s;ee in the dutchy of Car|niola, who&s;e waters often run off and return again in an extraordinary manner.

<P>With re&s;pect to commerce, Germany enjoys great advantages: for it not only borders on the German ocean, the Baltic, and the gulph of Ve|nice, but is watered by many navigable rivers, and &s;ituated in the heart of Europe; con&s;equently the inhabitants can commodiou&s;ly export their &s;u|perfluities, and import what they want of the commodities and manufactures of other countries. The goods exported from Germany are, corn, to|bacco, hor&s;es, lean cattle, butter, chee&s;e, honey, &s;yrup, wine, in particular the Rheni&s;h and Mo|&s;elle, the former of which has its principal &s;taple at Cologn, linen, woollen, &s;tuffs, yarn, ribbands, &s;ilk and cotton &s;tuffs, Nuremberg wares, goat|&s;kins,

wool, all &s;orts of wood, particularly for &s;hip-building, iron-plates, and &s;toves, cannon, ball, bombs, granadoes, tin-plates, &s;teel-work, copper, bra&s;s wire, porcelain, earthen ware, mirrors, gla&s;&s;es, beer, Brun&s;wic mum, tartar, &s;malt, zaffer, Pru&s;&s;ian blue, hogs bri&s;tles, printers ink, and many other things. The French buy up great numbers of hor&s;es in Germany to remount their cavalry. Towards the middle of the thirteenth century, &s;e|veral towns upon the German ocean and the Bal|tic entered into a league for the &s;ecurity and pro|motion of their trade and navigation, and were therefore called Han&s;e-towns. Tho' this league hath long &s;ince cea&s;ed to operate in regard to &s;e|veral of the&s;e towns, in con&s;equence of the decay of their trade, yet Hamburgh, Lubeck, and Bre|men, are &s;till called the Han&s;e-towns, and a league actually &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between them, under the name of which they conclude treaties of commerce with &s;oreign powers. Hamburgh is the chief town of trade in Germany, and next to it are Francfort on the Maine, Nuremberg, Aug&s;burg, Vienna, Fiume, and Trie&s;te, which la&s;t is a free port. There are great annual fairs at &s;ome towns in the empire, as at Francfort on the Maine, at Leip&s;ic, at Brun&s;|wic, Francfort on the Oder, Naumburg, and Mentz. A new trading company to A&s;ia hath been lately e&s;tabli&s;hed at Embden, by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The imports of the Germans con&s;i&s;t of a great variety of articles. In particular from Eng|land, they import woollen manufactures, tobacco, &s;ugar, ginger, Ea&s;t-India goods, tin, and lead; but &s;everal of the German princes having prohi|bited &s;ome particular &s;orts, and others all our woollen manufactures, the balance of trade is much again&s;t us with Germany.</P>

Yet there are only three or four mints allowed in each circle, unle&s;s an e&s;tate of the empire has mines of its own, and wants to erect a mint near it. By the laws of the empire the coin of each circle ought to be examined year|ly, and all the money of the empire ought to be according to one and the &s;ame &s;tandard, which at pre&s;ent is that of Leip&s;ic. The money of mo&s;t nations in Europe goes here near its value. The mo&s;t common German &s;ilver coin is a rixdollar, which is worth about four &s;hillings and &s;ixpence, but in &s;ome places only three &s;hillings and &s;ixpence. A German florin, or guilder, is worth generally about half a crown, and a gold ducat about nine &s;hillings.

<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to religion, the empire is pretty equally divided between papi&s;ts and prote&s;tants. The latter are again divided into Lutherans and Cal|vini&s;ts, or Reformed. The inhabitants of Au&s;tria and Bavaria are generally papi&s;ts; tho&s;e of Meck|lenburgh, Hol&s;tein, Brandenburgh, Saxony, and Pomerania, Lutherans; the He&s;&s;ians, and the people in the &s;outh of Franconia, Calvini&s;ts. In the re&s;t of the empire, particularly in Suabia, We&s;t|phalia, and the Circle of the Lower-Rhine, there is a mixture of all the&s;e &s;ects. The king of Pru&s;|&s;ia and his court are Calvini&s;ts; tho' his &s;ubjects are generally Lutherans, as well as tho&s;e of the elector of Saxony. The two la&s;t electors, for the &s;ake of the crown of Poland, profe&s;&s;ed them&s;elves papi&s;ts. According to Irenaeus, Chri&s;tianity was in a flouri&s;hing &s;tate in Germany about the middle of the &s;econd century. It is certain, however, that a great part of the country was utterly unac|quainted therewith, till about the end of the &s;e|venth and beginning of the eighth centuries. Un|der Charlemagne, in the eighth century, it was pretty well e&s;tabli&s;hed. His &s;on Lewis, being a weak bigotted prince, was exce&s;&s;ively profu&s;e in founding and endowing cloi&s;ters and churches. By degrees, and by various arts, in the dark ages, the popes got into their hands almo&s;t the entire
<PB N="190" REF="1950">
management of every thing relating to the church and eccle&s;ia&s;tics, both &s;ecular and regular; nay, they even claimed a power not only to controul, but to depo&s;e princes, to ab&s;olve their &s;ubjects from their allegiance, and di&s;po&s;e of their domi|nions as they thought fit. The tyranny and u&s;ur|pations of the popes, and the mon&s;trous corrup|tions and abu&s;es that had crept into, or been in|troduced, from worldly views of power and gran|deur, into the antient doctrine and di&s;cipline of the church, made all that were capable of any re|flexion among the laity, and every hone&s;t man a|mong the clergy, earne&s;tly wi&s;h for a reformation, which was at la&s;t boldly attempted by a native of this country, Dr. Martin Luther, in the &s;ixteenth century. The &s;tates of the empire that embraced the reformation, from their prote&s;ting in 1529 a|gain&s;t the conclu&s;ion of the diet at Spire, by which all innovations in religion, till the decree of a future council could be obtained, were declared unlaw|ful, obtained the name of Prote&s;tants. A religious war &s;oon after broke out, which was extingui&s;hed in &s;ome mea&s;ure in 1552, by the peace of Pa&s;&s;au, and more compleatly by that ratified at Au&s;burgh in 1555, by which a full toleration and liberty was granted to the prote&s;tants. This was farther confirmed and explained by the treaty of We&s;tpha|lia in 1648. By virtue of the&s;e conventions, no other religion but the Roman catholic, Lutheran, and Reformed, was to be introduced into, or to|lerated in the Holy Roman Empire. Some other &s;ects, notwith&s;tanding, in &s;ome places, actually enjoy the free exerci&s;e of their religion. Such of the above per&s;ua&s;ions as exi&s;ted in any &s;tate in the year 1624, are &s;till to be allowed; but it lies in the brea&s;t of the re&s;pective &s;overeigns, whether they will tolerate any that had neither public nor private exerci&s;e in the country in the year above|mentioned.
<PB N="191" REF="1960">
The power of the prote&s;tant &s;tates over their catholic &s;ubjects, in regard to religion, is the &s;ame as that which the catholic &s;tates have over their prote&s;tant &s;ubjects. Each party is obliged to allow the other the free exerci&s;e of their religion in their dominions, provided they were in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the year 1624. In the Roman catholic countries here, as well as el&s;ewhere, the clergy are in a great mea&s;ure independent of the civil power; but in the prote&s;tant &s;tates, the &s;upremacy is ve&s;ted in the &s;overeign. La&s;tly, the prote&s;tant, or evangelic body, have mutually agreed, that whenever, for the future, a Luthe|ran lord of a country &s;hall turn to the reformed church, or obtain a country of that per&s;ua&s;ion, or <HI>vice ver&s;&acirc;,</HI> that in that ca&s;e he &s;hall leave his &s;ub|jects the free exerci&s;e of their religion, with their whole form of church and &s;chool-di&s;cipline, and all other privileges what&s;oever.</P>

<HEAD>LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to the learning of the Germans, there is no where a more general ta&s;te for reading, e&s;pecially in the prote&s;tant countries, nor are more books any where written and printed than among the Germans. No people apply them&s;elves more clo&s;ely to their &s;tudies, and the Hebrew is in no country &s;o generally learnt, or better under&s;tood. Printing is encouraged to a fault; every man of letters is an author; they multiply books without number, millions of the&s;i&s;es and di&s;putations are annually publi&s;hed; for no man can be a graduate in their univer&s;ities who has not publi&s;hed one di&s;putation at lea&s;t. In this country there are thirty|&s;ix univer&s;ities, of which &s;eventeen are prote&s;tant, &s;eventeen Roman catholic, and two mixed; be&s;ides a va&s;t number of colleges, gymna&s;ia, pedagogies,
<PB N="192" REF="1970">
and Latin &s;chools. There are al&s;o many academies and &s;ocieties for the promoting the &s;tudy of natu|ral philo&s;ophy, the belles-lettres, antiquities, &amp;c. as the imperial Leopoldine academy of the Naturae Curio&s;i; the academy of &s;ciences at Berlin, at Got|tingen, at Erfurth, at Leip&s;ic, at Dui&s;burgh, to which we may add the Latin &s;ociety of Jena. Of the public libraries, the mo&s;t celebrated are tho&s;e of Vienna, Wolfenbuttel, Hanover, Got|tingen, Weimar, and the council-library at Leip|&s;ic. The Germans have written largely upon the Roman and canon laws. Stahl, Van Swieten, Storkh, Hoffman, and others, have contributed greatly to the improvement of phy&s;ic; Ruvinus and Dillenius of botany; Hei&s;ter of anatomy and &s;urgery; Neuman, Zemmermann, Pott, and Marg|graf, of chymi&s;try. In philo&s;ophy, natural and moral, the reputation of Leibnitz, Wolfius, Puf|fendorf, Thoma&s;ius, Otto van Gueriche, and Kep|ler, is great. Germany has al&s;o produced good political writers, geographers, and hi&s;torians: but they &s;eem to have no great ta&s;te or capacity for works of wit and entertainment, as poetry, plays, romances and novels, or what is called the belles|lettres; but they have had &s;ome good critics and antiquarians. They have one great defect, how|ever, in all their writings, namely, that they are extremely prolix, dry, and voluminous, and know little or nothing of that valuable art, in which many nations excel, namely, of enlivening their performances, and mixing the dulce with the utile. With re&s;pect to the fine arts the Germans have acquitted them&s;elves tolerably well. Ger|many has produced &s;ome good mu&s;icians, painters, architects, &s;culptors, and engravers. They even pretend to have been the fir&s;t inventors of en|graving, etching, and mezzotinto; as well as of gunpowder, guns, and printing. For the im|provement

of &s;ome of the&s;e arts, academies have been e&s;tabli&s;hed in &s;ome parts of Germany: at Vienna in particular and Berlin are academies for painting, &s;culpture, and architecture: at Dre&s;den and Nurenberg are academies for paint|ing; and at Aug&s;burgh is the imperial Franci&s;can academy of the fine arts.</P>

<HEAD>CONSTITUTION of the EMPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>In the fir&s;t centuries after the birth of Chri&s;t, Germany was divided into &s;everal petty &s;tates, which had no common &s;upreme head. After the di&s;&s;olution of the we&s;tern empire, the Franks, a German nation, &s;ubdued a great part both of Gaul and Germany: and about the year 800, Charlemagne, the &s;on of Pepin, king of France, founded a new empire in the We&s;t, con&s;i&s;ting of great part of Germany, France, Italy, and part of Spain. But about the year 880, the princes and &s;tates of the empire di&s;carded the French Carlovinian race, and elected Arnulph, the &s;on of Carolomon, king of Bavaria, their emperor. The dignity of emperor had been hitherto hereditary, but limit|ed by the diets, which had been fir&s;t introduced by the northern nations that overturned the Roman empire. At la&s;t under Henry IV. who was put under the ban by the pope, and upon that depo&s;ed by the &s;tates, the right of election was e&s;tabli&s;hed by papal management, and from that time has been con&s;tantly maintained. Henry VI. attempted in vain to make the crown heredi|tary in his family. The race of the hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria began with Rodolph of Hap&s;burg, who was elected emperor in the year 1273. Charles IV. at the diet of Nurenberg in 1356, formed the whole&s;ome regulations for the election of an em|peror, which are to this day known and ob&s;erved
<PB N="194" REF="1990">
under the name of the golden bull. In the year 1448, the celebrated Concordat between the empe|ror Frederic III. and certain &s;piritual and tempo|ral e&s;tates of the empire, and pope Nicholas V. was &s;ettled. This emperor was duke of Au&s;tria; and his po&s;terity, notwith&s;tanding the empire is elective, have had the addre&s;s to continue it in their family for three hundred years, namely, to the year 1740, when they lo&s;t it only for want of an heir male in the family; but the Au&s;trian fa|mily are now again in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, the pre&s;ent emperor being the grand&s;on of the emperor Charles VI. by his elde&s;t daughter Maria There&s;a, mar|ried to Francis I. late emperor, and grand-duke of Tu&s;cany, who was born duke of Lorrain. In the reign of the emperor Frederic III. the court now called the chamber of Witzlar was e&s;tabli&s;hed, and the empire was divided into ten circles. His &s;ucce&s;&s;or Charles V. fir&s;t &s;wore to a capitulation. In his time Mexico and Peru were conquered, whereby he became &s;overeign of much larger ter|ritories, and much richer, than any prince before him ever enjoyed. His brother Ferdinand e&s;tab|li&s;hed the aulic council. It was in&s;erted for the fir&s;t time in the capitulation of the emperor Mathias, grand&s;on of Ferdinand, that the electors for the future &s;hould be intituled to elect a king of the Romans, with or without the con&s;ent of the em|peror. In the reign of Ferdinand III. an end was put to the religious wars that began in the reign of Charles V. in con&s;equence of the reformation, by the treaty of We&s;tphalia. In the reign of his &s;on Leopold, the diet of the empire was opened at Rati&s;bon in the year 1663, where it &s;till con|tinues, and the imperial chamber of ju&s;tice was removed from Spire to Witzlar. This emperor conferred on Erne&s;t Augu&s;tus, of Brun&s;wick Lu|nenburgh, the ninth electoral dignity. His &s;on
<PB N="195" REF="2000">
Charles VI. having no male heirs, &s;ettled his he|reditary dominions on his elde&s;t daughter the arch-duche&s;s Maria There&s;a, which &s;ettlement was confirmed by the diet of the empire, and guaran|tied by mo&s;t of the powers of Europe. In 1742, Charles VII. elector of Bavaria, was cho&s;en em|peror, by the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of the vote of Bohemia; and after his death Francis I. grand-duke of Tu&s;cany. To him &s;ucceeded his elde&s;t &s;on Fer|dinand, the pre&s;ent emperor, who had been king of the Romans in his father's life-time.</P>

<HEAD>Of the EMPEROR and his PREROGATIVES.</HEAD>
<P>The empire is elective, and the laws of the empire require no other qualifications in a candi|date, but that he be <HI>ju&s;tus, bonus, et utilis,</HI> without any limitation in regard to religion, nation, &s;tate, or age. But as the popi&s;h electors are more in number than the prote&s;tant, a Roman catholic prince is always cho&s;en. The election is at Franckfort on the Maine, within three months after the former emperor's death. The electors appear either in per&s;on or by their envoys; and if an elector ab&s;ent him&s;elf, the election, notwith|&s;tanding, is valid. Before the day of election, all foreigners are ordered to depart the town. Whoever has more than half the voices of the college for him, is elected; and an elector may even give his vote for him&s;elf. When the elec|tion is over, the per&s;on elected, or his plenipoten|tiary, mu&s;t immediately &s;ub&s;cribe and &s;wear to the capitulation of election: but if the per&s;on elected is not pre&s;ent in per&s;on, he mu&s;t &s;wear to it him&s;elf before he is crowned, and before he can take upon him the government; which, till then, belongs to the vicars of the empire. His coronation, for which he appoints a day him&s;elf,
<PB N="196" REF="2010">
is always performed in the place where he was elected; tho' both election and coronation ought to be in the city of Aix-la-Chapelle. He then takes a general oath of a ruler, and among other things promi&s;es all due veneration to the pope and church. The emperors u&s;ed formerly to be crowned by the popes till the reign of Charles V. but from that time the papal coronation has been di&s;pen&s;ed with. However, immediately upon his entering upon the government, he te&s;tifies his veneration to the pope by an emba&s;&s;y. The title of the emperor runs thus: N. by the grace of God, elected Roman emperor (imperator) at all times augmenter of the empire (&s;emper Augu|&s;tus) in or of Germany king. Then follow the titles of the hereditary imperial dominions. The &s;tates of the empire give the emperor the title of mo&s;t illu&s;trious, mo&s;t powerful, and mo&s;t invinci|ble Roman emperor; the la&s;t of which is omitted by the electors. The emperor is looked upon by all other crowned heads and &s;tates in Europe as the fir&s;t European potentate, and as &s;uch prece|dence is given him and his amba&s;&s;adors. He is the &s;upreme head of the German empire; but his power in the admini&s;tration thereof is very li|mitted. With re&s;pect to eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, his prerogative con&s;i&s;ts principally in the right of the fir&s;t petition <HI>(jus primari arum precum)</HI> by virtue of which, in all foundations and cloi&s;ters of the em|pire, he may, once during his admini&s;tration, con|fer a benefice on any per&s;on qualified for it by the &s;tatutes; and on that of a panis brief to each foundation or cloi&s;ter in the empire, by virtue of which, &s;uch foundation is obliged to admit into it the per&s;on who has obtained the emperor's brief, and there provide him, during life, with meat, drink, cloaths, and other nece&s;&s;aries. With
<PB N="197" REF="2020">
re&s;pect to temporal matters, he can create princes, dukes, marqui&s;&s;es, counts, barons, knights, &amp;c. rai&s;e countries and territories to a higher rank; be|&s;tow arms, and grant letters of re&s;pite and pro|tection, &s;ecuring a debtor again&s;t his creditor; e&s;tabli&s;h univer&s;ities, fairs, and markets; em|power any per&s;on to adopt another, and to a&s;&s;ume a title from his e&s;tate; erect any place into a &s;anc|tuary; confer majority on minors; legitimate children born out of wedlock; confirm the con|tracts and &s;tipulations of the members of the em|pire; remit oaths extorted from them; inve&s;t &s;uch as po&s;&s;e&s;s fiefs of the empire, and decide in feudal matters relative thereto, &amp;c. but he cannot grant to any per&s;on privileges detrimental to the rights of the immediate &s;overeign of that per&s;on. He can al&s;o grant exclu&s;ive privileges for printing particular books, and for new invented machines, &amp;c. He appoints mo&s;t of the officers, civil and mi|litary, of the empire, except &s;uch as are hereditary, as the great chancellor, trea&s;urer, &amp;c. but the&s;e are only honorary. In antient times the emperor had con&s;iderable domains and incomes in the empire; but almo&s;t all the&s;e have been &s;ucce&s;&s;ive|ly mortgaged and alienated, &s;o that at pre&s;ent the certain revenues of the emperor are very in|con&s;iderable: but then, as he has the di&s;po&s;al of mo&s;t offices, the creation of princes and noblemen, is entitled to all confi&s;cations and forfeitures, and inve&s;ts the &s;everal princes in their e&s;tates, be&s;ides tho&s;e that hold fiefs of the empire in Italy, the profit of the&s;e articles may amount to a large &s;um. He has al&s;o &s;ome offerings from the Jews, and the free-gifts of the order of knights of the empire. A &s;ucce&s;&s;or in the empire is frequently cho&s;en by the electors during the life of the emperor, who is &s;tiled king of the Romans. He is elected and crowned in the &s;ame manner as the emperor, has

<HEAD>Of the DIET.</HEAD>
<P>The diet of the empire con&s;i&s;ts of the emperor, the nine electors, the eccle&s;ia&s;tical and &s;ecular princes, and the deputies of imperial cities. The electors are divided into &s;piritual and temporal. The &s;piritual electors are the archbi&s;hops of Mentz, Triers, and Cologne; and the &s;ecular, tho&s;e of Bohemia, Palatine, Brandenburgh, Saxony, Bavaria, and Hanover. The &s;piritual electors are &s;uch of cour&s;e as &s;oon as they are cho&s;en to their &s;ees by their re&s;pective chapters. In the reign of Henry IV. the right of election is &s;aid to have been introduced. Till the peace of We&s;tphalia there were only &s;even electors, when an eighth was added; and, in 1692, a ninth, in favour of the illu&s;trious hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick Lunenburgh, now in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a much higher and infinitely more valuable dignity, viz. the crown of Great Britain. The &s;piritual are &s;tiled by the emperor, Highly wor|thy nephews; the temporal, Mo&s;t illu&s;trious un|cles. By the other members of the empire, the &s;piritual, who were not born princes, are &s;tiled, Your electoral grace; but &s;uch as were, and al&s;o the temporal electors, have the appellation of, Your electoral &s;erenity. Foreign kings &s;tile the temporal electors, and tho&s;e of the &s;piritual, who

<P>The elector of Mentz is arch-chancellor of the Holy Roman empire in Germany, and director of the electoral college. This prince notifies the death of an emperor to his co-electors, appoints the diet of election, admini&s;ters the oath to the electors, or their envoys, collects their voices, proclaims the election, anoints the elected empe|ror, and either he, or the elector of Cologne, crowns him. He hears all grievances, and other matters, before the different colleges of the em|pire. He names a vice-chancellor of the empire, who takes an oath to him, as well as to the em|peror. He appoints all officers for the chancery of the empire, has &s;upreme juri&s;diction over them, as al&s;o the in&s;pection of the archives of the em|pire, and the protection of the po&s;t-office; in con&s;equence of which his coun&s;ellors pay no po&s;tage.</P>
<P>The elector of Treves is the arch-chancellor of the Holy Roman empire in Gaul, and the king|dom of Arles; but this at pre&s;ent is only a bare title. At an election of the king of the Romans he has the fir&s;t voice, and before the election takes the oath of the elector of Mentz.</P>
<P>The elector of Cologne is arch-chancellor of the Holy Roman empire in Italy. At an election of a king of the Romans he has the &s;econd voice, and he crowns the emperor, when the coronation is at Aix-la-Chapelle, and in the archbi&s;hopric of Cologne.</P>
<P>The king and elector of Bohemia is arch-cup|bearer of the Holy Roman empire, precedes all the temporal electors what&s;oever, and has the third voice in the electoral college.</P>
<P><PB N="200" REF="2050">
The elector of Bavaria is arch-&s;ewer of the Holy Roman empire. At the coronation he carries the monde before the emperor, ranks next to Bohe|mia, places four &s;ilver di&s;hes, weighing twelve marks, on the imperial table, and &s;erves up the fir&s;t cour&s;e.</P>
<P>The elector of Saxony is arch-mar&s;hal of the Holy Roman empire. He al&s;o, when there is no emperor, is one of the vicars of the empire. At the diets, and on other &s;olemn occa&s;ions, he carries the &s;word of &s;tate before the emperor; and, at the coronation, he rides into a heap of oats, and fills a &s;ilver mea&s;ure with that grain. During the holding of the diets, he has juri&s;diction over all electoral and other officers of the &s;tates of the empire, as al&s;o in criminal matters. When the &s;ee of Mentz is vacant, he holds the directory of the diet, and the right of protection over the imperial city of Mullhau&s;en, and all trumpeters throughout the Roman em|pire.</P>
<P>The elector of Brandenburgh is arch-chamber|lain of the Holy Roman empire, carries the &s;ceptre before the emperor, which he bears al&s;o in his coat of arms; pre&s;ents the emperor with water in a &s;ilver ba&s;on in order to wa&s;h him&s;elf; may pro|ceed with re&s;pect to his fiefs, principalities, and lands, as with allodial e&s;tates; and, at his own plea&s;ure, impo&s;e new tolls, and erect mills on all rivers.</P>
<P>The elector Palatine was formerly arch-&s;ewer, but &s;ince the treaty of We&s;tphalia arch-trea&s;urer. This hou&s;e has the right of protection over all the braziers of a large di&s;trict, and throughout all Germany is protector of the order of St. John; can rai&s;e nobles and gentlemen to the degree of counts, and has the right of venery, by virtue of which, all illegitimate per&s;ons, and others

of foreign countries, who within a year and a day have no &s;ucceeding lord, may be made bond&s;men in &s;uch places as are &s;ubject to his juri&s;diction: &s;o that they mu&s;t bind them&s;elves to the duties of the electorate, and to the payment of a certain tribute and mortuaries.</P>
<P>When the elector of Bavaria was put under the ban of the empire in 1706, the Palatine recovered the office of arch-&s;ewer, and the elector of Brun&s;|wic Lunenburg obtained the office of arch-trea|&s;urer, by which he &s;till &s;tiles him&s;elf, till another &s;uitable arch-office be conferred on him. He en|joys the alternate &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in the bi&s;hopric of O&s;|naburgh, together with &s;ome other rights and pri|vileges.</P>
<P>Without the privity of the&s;e electors, the em|peror can do nothing with regard to leagues and wars of the empire, alienations and mortgages of lands belonging to it, &amp;c. At their inve&s;titure they pay no fees, and a new elected emperor mu&s;t immediately confirm their privileges and dignities. The diets are held by the emperor, with the con|&s;ent of the electors; and, at their de&s;ire, each elec|tor enjoys a right of appointing two chamber|court a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and their electorates have an unli|mited privilege, <HI>de non appellando.</HI> They may meet together, and hold what are called electoral diets. A &s;ubject may be guilty of trea&s;on again&s;t them; and their whole electorates de&s;cend to their fir&s;t-born. By the imperial capitulation, their envoys are to take place of princes in per&s;on.</P>
<P>Next to the electors are the princes of the em|pire, who are al&s;o partly &s;piritual and partly tem|poral. The &s;piritual are archbi&s;hops, bi&s;hops, abbots, provo&s;ts, abbe&s;&s;es, the ma&s;ters of the Teutonic order, and of St. John; but of the&s;e, &s;ome have each a voice, and others vote by col|leges.
<PB N="202" REF="2070">
The temporal princes are dukes, mar|qui&s;&s;es, counts, vi&s;counts, barons, of which, as among the &s;piritual, the higher have &s;ingle voices, but the lower vote by colleges.</P>
<P>Not only all tho&s;e princes who have &s;eat and voice in the diet, but many others, are ve&s;ted with &s;overeign power in their re&s;pective territories, or at lea&s;t are under very few re&s;traints. They are, indeed, more free and ab&s;olute than &s;ome crowned heads; but &s;till they are &s;ubject to the general laws of the empire, and &s;worn not to en|gage in any wars or alliances to the prejudice of the emperor and empire. But here it is to be ob&s;erved that many have titles of nobility, though they are no &s;overeigns, nor have any &s;eat in the diets: &s;ome, however, have a &s;eat, that do not hold immediately of the emperor, or, which is the &s;ame, are immediately &s;ubject to &s;ome other prince, and only mediately to the emperor. The Franks, in imitation of the Romans, reduced all Germany into provinces, over which they placed governors with different titles. They were gene|rally of noble families, and if there was no mate|rial objection again&s;t it, their &s;ons were appointed to &s;ucceed them; from whence the&s;e governors came at length to in&s;i&s;t on a right of &s;ucceeding their ance&s;tors, and refu&s;ed to pay homage to the German emperors, every one taking upon him to exerci&s;e regal power in his province; from whence have &s;prung up &s;o many petty &s;ove|reigns in the empire. The&s;e officers were either hertogen, or dukes, to whom were committed the government of the larger di&s;tricts. Graffen, or earls, who had the care of &s;maller parts; P&s;altz-graven, pal&s;graves, or counts-palatine, who admini&s;tered ju&s;tice when in the verge of the court; landgraves, who were &s;et over provinces;
<PB N="203" REF="2080">
margraves, or marqui&s;&s;es, who were charged with the care of the marches or borders; and bur|graves, who were governors of the royal ca&s;tles and forts. The third college of the diet is that of the free or imperial cities, i. e. &s;uch as is go|verned by magi&s;trates of their own, and &s;tand immediately under the emperor and empire. Some of the&s;e are wholly Catholic, others entirely Lu|theran, and others again mixed. Within their territory they exerci&s;e &s;upreme power, and are di|vided into two benches, the Rheni&s;h and Sua|bian. As the princes of the empire took advan|tage of the nece&s;&s;ities or indulgence of the Ger|man emperors, to erect the governments they held in capacity of viceroys or governors into indepen|dent principalities and &s;tates, &s;o did the cities now called free and imperial. The emperors, fre|quently wanting &s;upplies of money to carry on wars, or for other occa&s;ions, borrowed large &s;ums of the wealthy trading towns, and paid them again in munificent grants and privileges, making them free &s;tates and independent of the governors of the provinces where they &s;tood: accordingly, the&s;e cities, like the princes, exerci&s;e all kinds of &s;overeign power that are con&s;i&s;tent with the gene|ral laws of the empire; they make laws, con&s;ti|tute courts of ju&s;tice, coin money, rai&s;e forces, and enter into alliances and confederacies; only acknowledging the emperor for their &s;upreme lord, and contributing their &s;hare towards the common defence of the empire. The diet meets at Rati&s;bon on the emperor's &s;ummons, and any of the princes may &s;end their deputies thither in their &s;tead. The diet makes laws, rai&s;es taxes, determines differences between the &s;everal princes and &s;tates, and can relieve &s;ubjects from the oppre&s;&s;ions of their &s;overeign: and there are two
<PB N="204" REF="2090">
&s;upreme councils, called the aulic council, and the chamber of Witzlar, to which any of the princes and &s;tates, or their &s;ubjects, may appeal, when they apprehend them&s;elves aggrieved. The em|pire was antiently divided into ten circles, which divi&s;ion was confirmed by the emperor Charles V. who &s;ettled the portion which every circle and every prince and member of each circle &s;hould contribute towards the ordinary and extraordinary taxes of the empire. This was entered in a regi&s;|ter, called a Matriculation-book, which is kept by the elector of Mentz. The taxes are either ordinary or extraordinary. The former is what is &s;tiled the chamber-terms, or the money which each &s;tate of the empire is to contribute annually for maintaining the chamber-judicatory of the emperor and empire. The latter are called Ro|man months, which are a certain rate of money or troops &s;ettled by the &s;tates of the empire, and granted &s;ometimes to the emperor, as for in&s;tance, for the &s;upport of the emperor, or of the army of the empire, or the forts thereof, or for the war again&s;t the Turks, the expences of an emba&s;&s;y of the em|pire, &amp;c. By the Matricula &s;ettled by Charles V. twelve florins were to be paid monthly in lieu of every hor&s;eman, and four for every foot &s;oldier. Afterwards it was enacted, that &s;ixty florins &s;hould be advanced in lieu of every trooper wanting, and twelve for every footman; and the&s;e payments obtained the name of Roman months, becau&s;e the forces or money abovementioned were at fir&s;t applied towards the rai&s;ing a body of hor&s;e and foot for &s;ix months, to conduct the emperor in his journey to Rome to receive the papal coronation. Be&s;ides the diet, there are yearly meetings of the &s;tates of one, two, or three of the circles that lie neare&s;t to one another, called from thence, cor|re&s;ponding
<PB N="205" REF="2100">
circles, of which there are three cla&s;&s;es, fir&s;t, the Upper Rhine, Lower Rhine, and We&s;t|phalia. Secondly, the Upper and Lower Saxony; and, thirdly, Franconia, Swabia, and Au&s;tria. That of Upper Saxony a&s;&s;embles u&s;ually at Leip&s;ic; that of Franconia at Nuremberg; and that of Swabia at Ulm. They treat of the regulation of their coin, the public peace, their trea&s;ure, magazines, for|tifications and commerce, rectifying the Matri|cula, putting the decrees of the empire in execu|tion, and appointing judges of the imperial cham|ber of Witzlar or Spire, and of the aulic council at Vienna; and have power of enacting laws which are not incon&s;i&s;tent with the con&s;titution of the em|pire. In every circle there are one or two direc|tors, who &s;ummon the &s;tates of the circle, and have the command of the militia, when embodied, regulating their march, quarters, &amp;c. and putting the decrees of the empire in execution, when any prince or member refu&s;es to comply with their re&s;olutions. It is to be ob&s;erved here, that the prote&s;tant e&s;tates of the empire, in the diets, are called the evangelic body, and have a director, viz. the elector of Saxony. Be&s;ides the higher nobi|lity, or high adel of the empire, con&s;i&s;ting of princes and counts, &amp;c. there is the lower adel, or rank of knighthood, which is very numerous in Germany.</P>
<P>We have thus given &s;ome general account of the con&s;titution of the German empire; but the Germanic body is &s;o large and complex, their pri|vileges, connexions, and dependencies &s;o various and intricate, that if we were to enter into a mi|nute or particular account of them, we &s;hould be obliged greatly to exceed the limits which we have pre&s;cribed to our&s;elves.</P>

<HEAD>Of the PERSONS and CHARACTER of the GERMANS.</HEAD>
<P>The Germans are of a good &s;tature, with fair complexions and agreeable features; but neither their &s;hape nor mien are to be admired, any more than the brightne&s;s of their parts, which are not at all improved by their regimen or way of life, for no people eat and drink to greater exce&s;s than the Germans. Germany, notwith&s;tanding, hath produced great men, a circum&s;tance which may proceed from their unwearied application to what|ever they undertake, and their travelling to other countries, where they conver&s;e with the polite&s;t men of every nation; and it is no wonder if it produces great generals, being perpetually en|gaged in wars, either with the chri&s;tian princes their neighbours, or the Turks. The Germans are now e&s;teemed, as they were formerly, an hone&s;t ho&s;pitable people, free from artifice and di&s;gui&s;e, &s;ocial, open, and conver&s;ible, e&s;pecially if a little elevated and warmed by the bottle, as being na|turally phlegmatic and &s;aturnine. They are taught to drink from their cradles; and not only private concerns, but affairs of &s;tate, are generally tran&s;|acted over the bottle. A certain modern author, in his character of the Germans, &s;ays, "That they want &s;pirit to actuate their large bodies, and heat to concoct their phlegmatic humour: that their courage appears from the many victories they have gained, e&s;pecially over the infidels; that they are free from malice and di&s;&s;imulation, much addicted to gluttony and drunkenne&s;s, but not over amorous; that the common people are laborious and hone&s;t, but &s;low and heavy; that
<PB N="207" REF="2120">
the merchants and trade&s;men are very fair in their dealings, ho&s;pitable, and complai&s;ant; that the no|bility are men of great honour, and commonly &s;cholars; that they value them&s;elves much upon their birth and family; that mo&s;t of the princes being poor, their younger &s;ons generally engage in the &s;ervice of the emperor, the electors, or &s;ome foreign &s;tate; or procure them&s;elves &s;ome of the rich eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments, which are &s;o numerous in the Roman catholic &s;tates; that the prote&s;tant clergy are learned and exemplary in their deportment, but the popi&s;h ignorant and liber|tine; that no people have more fea&s;ting at mar|riages, funerals, and birth-days; that the Ger|mans have excellent mechanic geniu&s;es, &amp;c." The number of the inhabitants of Germany can only be determined with probability. It is in general populous, and in that re&s;pect has rather the &s;upe|riority over France, for which it would be more than a match if it was united under one head. The inhabitants are computed at about twenty|four millions, and if they do not make &s;o great a figure abroad as the French, they are probably more happy at home, as they have more liberty, and live in greater plenty. Few of the territories of the German princes are &s;o large as to be a&s;&s;igned to viceroys, to be oppre&s;&s;ed and fleeced at plea|&s;ure: nor are they without redre&s;s when they &s;uf|fer any grievance; they may appeal to the general diet, or great councils of the empire, for relief. Whereas, in France, the lives and fortunes of the &s;ubject are entirely at the di&s;po&s;al of the grand monarch. The &s;ubjects of the petty princes in Germany are generally the mo&s;t unhappy; for the&s;e princes, affecting the grandeur and &s;plendor of the more powerful, in the number and appear|ance of their officers and dome&s;tics, in their pa|laces,

gardens, pictures, curio&s;ities, guards, bands of mu&s;ic, tables, dre&s;s, and furniture, are obliged to &s;upport all this vain pomp and parade, by fleecing their mi&s;erable va&s;&s;als and dependents. With re&s;pect to the burghers and pea&s;ants of Ger|many, the former, in many places, enjoy great privileges; the latter al&s;o, in &s;ome parts, as for in&s;tance, in Franconia, Swabia, and on the Rhine, are generally a free people, or only perform certain &s;ervices to their &s;uperiors, and only pay taxes: whereas in the marqui&s;ate of Brandenburg, Po|merania, Lu&s;atia, Moravia, Bohemia, Au&s;tria, &amp;c. they may ju&s;tly be denominated &s;laves, tho' in different degrees. The inhabitants of Vienna live luxuriou&s;ly, a great part of their time being &s;pent in fea&s;ting and carou&s;ing: dancing and fencing are their ordinary recreations within doors; and in the winter, when the &s;everal branches of the Danube are frozen over, and the ground co|vered with &s;now, the ladies take their recreation in &s;ledges of different &s;hapes, &s;uch as griffins, ty|gers, &s;wans, &s;collop-&s;hells, &amp;c. Here the lady &s;its, dre&s;&s;ed in velvet, lined with rich furs, and adorned with laces and jewels, having on her head a velvet cap; and the &s;ledge is drawn by one hor&s;e, &s;et off with plumes of feathers, ribbons, and bells. As this diver&s;ion is taken chiefly in the night-time, &s;ervants ride before the &s;ledge with torches, and a gentleman &s;itting on the &s;ledge behind guides the hor&s;e. The German women, as well as men, are generally large and corpulent, but have god complexions, and are more ob&s;e|quious to their hu&s;bands than our Briti&s;h ladies u&s;ually are. They are generally well educated and fond of mu&s;ic, but more addicted to gaming than becomes their &s;ex; and it is ob&s;erved they are not very talkative.</P>

<HEAD>CURIOSITIES.</HEAD>
<P>Among the curio&s;ities of this country, the Zerknitzer lake, in Carniola, is one of the mo&s;t remarkable. Its waters retire in June, and it be|comes good pa&s;ture; and after Michaelmas the waters return again with great fury, &s;pouting out of the ground to a great height. The tun at Heidelburg is another curio&s;ity; it holds eight hundred hog&s;heads, and is generally full of the be&s;t Rheni&s;h wine, from which foreigners are &s;eldom &s;uffered to retire &s;ober. Vienna it|&s;elf is a curio&s;ity; for here you &s;ee the greate&s;t va|riety of inhabitants that is to be met with any where, as Greeks, Tran&s;ylvanians, Sclavonians, Turks, Tartars, Hungarians, Croats, Germans, Poles, Spaniards, French, and Italians, in their proper habits. The imperial library at Vienna is in great e&s;teem, containing upwards of eighty thou&s;and volumes, among which are many valua|ble manu&s;cripts in Hebrew, Syriac, Arabic, Turki&s;h, Armenian, Coptic, and Chine&s;e. There is a fair manu&s;cript of the New Te&s;tament in Greek, written fifteen hundred years ago in gold letters upon purple. Here are likewi&s;e many thou&s;and Greek, Roman, and Gothic coins and medals, with a va&s;t collection of other curio&s;ities in art and nature. Mo&s;t of the palaces and cathe|drals of Germany are Gothic, but &s;tately; the town-hou&s;es are more magnificent than tho&s;e of other countries; few princes, or even the noble|men, are without cabinets of rarities; and their gardens are laid out in the Italian ta&s;te. They know not what it is to line or wain&s;cot rooms. The hou&s;es in the towns are mo&s;tly old fa&s;hioned; tho&s;e on the Rhine are generally of timber inlaid with brick. Almo&s;t all the towns have old forti|fications,

con&s;i&s;ting of a wall or rampart faced with brick, a trench full of water, and gates de|fended by half moons. In &s;ome places the com|mon way of &s;leeping is between two feather-beds with the &s;heets &s;tiched to them. The Germans, like all the northern nations except ours, u&s;e &s;toves, the lea&s;t of which, the ladies, like the Dutch, carry to church. The women of quality are fond of jewels and rich cloaths, but u&s;e neither loo&s;e gowns nor petticoats. The caps, coats, gloves, and boots of the Germans, are generally lined with fur. Their hunting is chiefly of deer and wild boars; the latter, in &s;ome places, are reckon|ed good food. The indifference of the great men about the improvement of their country and the pro&s;perity of the &s;ubject are, perhaps, greater in this country than in the mo&s;t ab&s;olute govern|ments.</P>

<P>THIS circle is bounded to the &s;outh by the circle of Upper Saxony, and a part of that of the Upper Rhine; to the north by the duchy of Sle&s;wick, belonging to the king of Denmark, and the Baltic; to the we&s;t by the circle of We&s;t|phalia and the North Sea; and to the ea&s;t by the circle of Upper Saxony. The &s;tates belonging to it are the dukes and princes of Magdeburg and Bremen, Zell, Grubenhagen, Calenburg, Wolf|enbuttle, Halber&s;tadt, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Mecklenburgh-Gu&s;tro, Hol&s;tein-Gluck&s;tadt, Hol|&s;tein Gottorf, Hilde&s;heim, Saxe-Lauenburg, the arch|bi&s;hopric of Lubeck, the principalities of Schwerin, Ratzeburg, Blankenburg, Ranzau, the imperial cities of Lubeck, Gotzlar, Muhlhau&s;en, Nord|hau&s;en, Hamburgh, and Bremen. The dukes of Bremen and Magdeburg are alternately directors and &s;ummoning princes; but ever &s;ince the year 1682, the diets, which u&s;ed generally to be held at Brun&s;wick or Luneburg, have been di&s;continued. Towards the army of the empire, which, by a de|cree of the empire in 1681, was &s;ettled at forty thou&s;and men, this circle was to furni&s;h one thou|&s;and three hundred and twenty-two hor&s;emen, and two thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;even foot; and of the three hundred thou&s;and florins granted to the imperial che&s;t in 1707, its quota was thirty-one thou&s;and two hundred and &s;eventy-one florins; both which a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments are the &s;ame with tho&s;e of Upper Saxony, Burgundy, Swabia; and We&s;tpha|lia.

The Saale circle, and that of Luxkenwalde, are &s;eparated from the re&s;t, and &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by a part of Upper Saxony. This country is, for the mo&s;t part, level, but &s;andy, mar&s;hy, or overgrown with woods. There are &s;alt &s;prings in it &s;o rich, that they are &s;ufficient to &s;upply all Germany with that commo|dity. The Holz circle is the mo&s;t fruitful part of it. In the Saale circle, where wood is &s;carce, there is pit-coal; and at Rothenburg is a copper-mine worked. The duchy is well watered; for the Elbe pa&s;&s;es through it, and the Saale, Havel, Aller, Ohre, and El&s;ter, either ri&s;e in, or wa&s;h &s;ome part of it in their cour&s;e. The whole duchy, ex|clu&s;ive of that part of the county of Mansfeld which is connected with it, is &s;aid to contain twenty|nine cities, &s;ix towns, about four hundred and thirty villages, and three hundred and thirty thou|&s;and inhabitants.

the &s;tates the direction of the finances as formerly. Before the reformation it was an archbi&s;hopric, &s;ubject in &s;pirituals to the pope alone, and its pre|late was primate of all Germany; but embracing the reformation, it cho&s;e it&s;elf admini&s;trators, till the treaty of Mun&s;ter in 1648, when it was given, together with the bi&s;hopric of Halber&s;tadt, to the elector of Brandenburg, as an equivalent for the Hither Pomerania, granted by that treaty to the king of Sweden. Lutherani&s;m is the predominant religion here; but Calvini&s;ts, Jews, and Roman catholics are tolerated. Of the la&s;t there are five convents, which never embraced the reformation. All the Lutheran pari&s;hes, amounting to three hundred and fourteen, are &s;ubject to &s;ixteen in|&s;pectors, under one general &s;uperintendant; only the clergy of the old town of Magdeburg are un|der the direction of their &s;enior. The Jews have a &s;ynagogue at Halle. The manufactures of the duchy are cloth, &s;tuffs, &s;tockings, linen, oil-&s;kins, leather, and parchment, of which, and grain of all &s;orts, large quantities are exported. The arms of it are, party per pale, ruby, and pearl. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, as duke of Magdeburg, &s;its and votes between the elector of Bavaria, as duke of Bava|ria, and the elector-palatine, as pal&s;grave of Lau|tern. Of the &s;tates of the circle of Lower Saxony he is the fir&s;t. His matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment for the duchy is, forty-three hor&s;e, and one hundred and ninety-&s;ix foot, or thirtee hundred florins monthly; and to the chamber of Witzlar, three hundred and forty-three florins and forty kruitzers. For the civil government of the duchy, there is a council of regency, with a war and deme&s;ne cham|ber; and for the eccle&s;ia&s;tical, a con&s;i&s;tory, and general &s;uperintendant. The revenues of the duchy, ari&s;ing from the &s;alt-works, deme&s;nes, and taxes, &s;ome of which are very heavy and oppre&s;|&s;ive,

<P>Magdeburg, which gives name to it, and is not only the capital, but that of all Lower Saxony, and formerly even of all Germany. It &s;tands on the Elbe, fifty-eight miles north-we&s;t of Wittem|berg, &s;ixty north of Leip&s;ic and ea&s;t of Brun&s;|wic, &s;ixty-one we&s;t of Berlin, one hundred and thirteen &s;outh-ea&s;t of Hamburgh, one hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix ea&s;t of Mun&s;ter, one hundred and &s;eventy-four north of Nuremberg, and two hun|dred and ninety-five north-we&s;t of Vienna. It is a city of great trade, &s;trongly fortified, and very antient. Its name &s;ignifies the Maiden City, which, &s;ome imagine, took its ri&s;e from the temple of Venus, which is &s;aid to have &s;tood here antiently, and to have been de&s;troyed by Charlemagne. The founder of the city is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been Otho I. or his empre&s;s Editha, daughter to Ed|mund, the Saxon king of England. The &s;ame empe|ror founded a Benedictine convent here, which he afterwards converted into an archbi&s;hopric, of which the archbi&s;hop was a count palatine, and had very great privileges, particularly that of wearing the archiepi&s;copal pallium, and having the cro&s;s borne before him, be&s;ides many others. The fir&s;t tourna|ment in Germany is &s;aid to have been appointed near this city, by the emperor Henry the Fowler; but the&s;e pa&s;times were afterwards aboli&s;hed, becau&s;e they occa&s;ioned &s;uch envy and animo&s;ity among the nobility, that &s;everal of them killed one an|other upon the &s;pot. The &s;ituation of the city is very convenient and plea&s;ant, upon the banks of
<PB N="215" REF="2200">
the Elbe, amid&s;t &s;pacious fruitful plains, and on the road betwixt High and Low Germany. It has been a great &s;ufferer by fires and &s;ieges; but by none &s;o much as that in 1631, when the emperor's general, count Tilly, took it by &s;torm, plundered and &s;et it on fire, by which it was entirely reduced to a&s;hes, except the cathedral, the convent of our Lady, and a few cottages belonging to fi&s;hermen; of forty thou&s;and burghers not above four hundred e&s;caping. The &s;oldiers &s;pared neither age nor &s;ex, but ripped up women with child, murdered &s;uck|ing infants in &s;ight of their parents, and ravi&s;hed young women in the &s;treets; to prevent which violation, many of them flung them&s;elves into the Elbe, and others into the fire. The city is now populous, large, and well built, particularly the broad &s;treet and cathedral-&s;quare. The principal buildings are the king's palace, the governor's hou&s;e, the armoury, guildhall, and cathedral. The la&s;t is a &s;uperb &s;tructure in the antique ta&s;te, dedi|cated to St. Maurice, which has a fine organ, the ma&s;ter-pipe of which is &s;o big, that a man can &s;carce cla&s;p it with both arms; and contains the tombs of the emperor Otho and the empre&s;s Edi|tha, a fine marble &s;tatue of St. Maurice, a por|phyry font, an altar in the choir of one &s;tone of divers colours, curiou&s;ly wrought, and many other curio&s;ities. They &s;hew here a bed&s;tead and table, which belonged to Martin Luther, when he was an Augu&s;tine friar in a cloi&s;ter of this city before the reformation. Among the relicks, they pre|tend to have the ba&s;on in which Pilate wa&s;hed his hands after his condemnation of our Saviour, the lantern which Judas made u&s;e of when he appre|hended him, and the ladder on which the cock crowed after St. Peter denied him. The chapter con&s;i&s;ts of a provo&s;t, &s;ixteen major and &s;even minor canons; be&s;ides which, there are four other
<PB N="216" REF="2210">
Lutheran collegiate foundations, and a Lutheran convent, dedicated to our Lady, in which is a &s;chool or &s;eminary. Here is al&s;o a gymna&s;ium, with an academy, in which young gentlemen are in&s;tructed in the art of war. The canons of the chapter, which, except the change of religion, is upon the &s;ame footing as before the reformation, mu&s;t make proof of their nobility. The prebends and dignities are all in the gift of the elector; and the revenue of the provo&s;t is computed at twelve thou&s;and crowns a-year. Here is a great trade, and a variety of manufactures. The chief are tho&s;e of woollen cloths and &s;tuffs, &s;ilks, cottons, linen, &s;tockings, hats, gloves, tobacco, and &s;nuff. The city was formerly one of the Han&s;e and impe|rial towns. Editha, con&s;ort to Otho I. on whom it was conferred as a dowry, among many other privileges and advantages, procured it the grant of a yearly fair. The bargravate of this city was antiently an office of great power, having the civil and criminal juri&s;diction, the office of hereditary cup-bearer being annexed to it, and was long held as a fief of the archbi&s;hopric, but afterwards be|came an imperial fief, which was again conferred on the archbi&s;hopric by the elector of Saxony, up|on certain conditions. The longitude of the city is twelve degrees nine minutes ea&s;t, and the lati|tude fifty-two &s;ixteen.</P>

<P>Halle, a large town lying on the Saale, twenty|four miles north-we&s;t of Leip&s;ic, and forty &s;outh of Magdeburg. It is thought to have had its name from the &s;alt-pits di&s;covered here, before the birth of our Saviour, by the Hermauduri, and which the emperor Otho the Great be&s;towed on the archbi&s;hopric of Magdeburg. His &s;on Otho gave this town a charter, by the name of Halle, and made it an imperial city. There are four &s;alt|&s;prings in the town, and a great number of boil|ing-hou&s;es in and about it. The toll of the &s;alt a hundred years ago amounted to five or &s;ix hundred crowns a week. Some of the boiling-hou&s;es belong to the king, &s;ome to the citizens and corporation of Halle, and &s;ome to religious foundations and churches; but of the produce of tho&s;e that are the property of private per&s;ons or communities, a certain part belongs to the king. Tho&s;e who rent the boiling-hou&s;es are called planners, and mu&s;t be freemen of Halle; and tho&s;e who boil the &s;alt are called Hallers, who &s;till retain the dre&s;s, language, and cu&s;toms of their ance&s;tors the Wends, or Sclavonians, who antiently inhabited this country. A great part of the &s;alt made here is conveyed by the Elbe to Brandenburg, Pome|rania, Sile&s;ia, and Pru&s;&s;ia, where, as well as in Franconia, whither it is conveyed by the Achs, it is &s;old by the king's factors. To the&s;e &s;alt|&s;prings the city of Halle owes its origin, and, in a great mea&s;ure, its flouri&s;hing condition, to which the univer&s;ity hath al&s;o not a little contributed. This univer&s;ity was founded in 1694 by the elec|tor Frederic, who was the fir&s;t king of Pru&s;&s;ia. Since that time, to the year 1744, the number
<PB N="219" REF="2240">
of &s;tudents amounted to upwards of twenty-nine thou&s;and, of whom two were princes, one hundred and twenty counts, two thou&s;and two hundred and fifty-three barons and gentlemen, twelve thou&s;and two hundred and &s;eventy-eight &s;tudents of divinity, twelve thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and twenty-&s;ix &s;tudents of law, and one thou&s;and nine hundred and forty-one of phy&s;ic. It is &s;aid to have the advantage of that of Leip&s;ic, not only in regard to the abilities of the profe&s;&s;ors, but al&s;o to the cheapne&s;s of living and di&s;cipline. Its li|brary con&s;i&s;ts of upwards of ten thou&s;and volumes. Here are al&s;o a Lutheran and Calvini&s;t gymna&s;ium, a free &s;ecular Calvini&s;t nunnery, three Lutheran churches, &s;everal Calvini&s;t churches, chapels, and ho&s;pitals, a popi&s;h chapel, and a Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue. The inhabitants, exclu&s;ive of the &s;tudents and garri&s;on, are computed at fourteen thou&s;and. The magi&s;trates have divers privileges, a large e&s;tate, and juri&s;diction, and a fine library, which is open &s;everal days in the week for the u&s;e of the profe&s;&s;ors and &s;tudents of the univer&s;ity. The noble foundation of the orphan-hou&s;e, in this city, redounds greatly to the honour both of the pre|&s;ent age and prote&s;tant religion. Here is al&s;o a correction and work-hou&s;e, and a variety of ma|nufactures, as gloves, woollen and &s;ilk &s;tockings, &s;tuffs, fu&s;tians, cloths, flannel, linen, porcelain, tobacco-pipes, gold, &s;ilver, and plain &s;ilk ribbons, &s;tarch, metal buttons, with red and yellow Turkey leather. They have al&s;o began here to plant white mulberry-trees, for the breeding of &s;ilk|worms. The inhabitants of this city are reck|oned to &s;peak the be&s;t high Dutch or German of any place in the empire, and are much com|mended for their genteel and courteous beha|viour. In 1757 and 1758, this town, being &s;ur|prized

Here &s;tands the celebrated or|phan-hou&s;e, in which two hundred orphans are maintained and educated gratis, and many other young per&s;ons, either partly or wholly, at their own expence. The income ari&s;es not only from the prote&s;tant parts of Germany, but al&s;o from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Ru&s;&s;ia, Poland, Pru&s;&s;ia, Courland, Hungary, Tran&s;ylva|nia, Swi&s;&s;erland, Holland, England, and even from other parts &s;till more remote. The in&s;truc|tion is the &s;ame to all, whether they are orphans maintained by the foundation, or &s;uch as keep them&s;elves, either wholly or in part. In the &s;chool are taught Latin, Greek, French, Hebrew, divinity, logic, mathematics, phy&s;ic, geography, hi&s;tory, writing, arithmetic, epi&s;tolatory corre&s;|pondence, and &s;inging, each in &s;eparate cla&s;&s;es, by fifty preceptors, who are al&s;o &s;tudents in divinity, and under two in&s;pectors. In the hou&s;e is a &s;emi|nary in which the preceptors are qualified for the &s;everal &s;chools, a di&s;pen&s;atory, laboratory, print|ing pre&s;&s;es, a library, and mu&s;eum.

<HEAD>BRUNSWIC-LUNEBURG.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e territories of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wic-Luneburg lie mo&s;tly in this circle, with a &s;mall part of them in that of We&s;tphalia and Upper-Saxony. Tho&s;e that lie in this circle are the duchies of Bremen and Lauenburg, the principa|lities of Luneburg, Calenberg, and Grubenhagen, with their incorporated counties and lord&s;hips. In
<PB N="222" REF="2270">
the circle of We&s;tphalia is the principality of Verden, with the counties of Hoya, Deepholt, Spiegelberg, and Hallermund; the two la&s;t of which are incorporated with the principality of Calenberg. In that of Upper-Saxony is only the county of Hohn&s;tein. To the&s;e mu&s;t al&s;o be added the two counties of Bentheim and Stern|berg, in the circle of We&s;tphalia, which were mortgaged, with the &s;overeignty thereof, to the electoral hou&s;e. The&s;e territories are almo&s;t con|tiguous, and are nearly equal to the electorates of Bavaria and Saxony, or the circle of Swabia, con|taining fifty-eight cities, above &s;ixty market-towns, and near &s;even hundred and fifty thou&s;and inha|bitants. Tho' in the&s;e countries there is much &s;andy, mar&s;hy, heathy, barren ground; yet there is al&s;o in them a great deal of good corn-land, yielding wheat, barley, oats, rye, pea&s;e, beans, vetches, with fruit and roots of various kinds, flax, hemp, tobacco, and &s;ome woad and mad|der. They yield al&s;o wood, honey, wax, pitch, tar, all &s;orts of game, &s;heep, hor&s;es, black cattle, and fi&s;h. In &s;ome places, particularly in the Hartz fore&s;t, are found a variety of minerals and fo&s;&s;ils, &s;uch as coal, &s;late, lime&s;tone, marble, and &s;tone; vitriol, lapis calaminaris, &s;ulphur, zink, cobalt, iron, lead, copper, and &s;ilver. In many places are rich &s;alt &s;prings, and in others plenty of turf. As to the manufactures of the&s;e territories, they con&s;i&s;t principally of a variety of woollen cloths and &s;tuffs, linen, thread, laces, beautiful carpets, manufactures of cotton, gold twi&s;t, galoons, fringes, &s;word-knots, halberds, ta&s;&s;els, and embroidery of all &s;orts, &s;alt, tobacco-pipes, fire-arms, paper, gun-powder, colours, hats, &s;kins, and tobacco: add to the&s;e bleaching of wax, and refining of &s;ugar. The exports of the&s;e manufac|tures, and the unwrought produce of the &s;everal
<PB N="223" REF="2280">
countries, are &s;aid to amount yearly to &s;ome thou|&s;ands of rix-dollars; but whether they exceed, or fall &s;hort of its importations in value, we are not told. To the education of youth, be&s;ides &s;chools and academies, or gymna&s;ia in the chief towns, there is an univer&s;ity at Gottingen, provided with very able profe&s;&s;ors, founded by his late maje&s;ty George II. With re&s;pect to religion, Lutherani&s;m is the predominant. In &s;ome places the Roman catholics are tolerated, particularly at Hanover and Gottingen. At Norten al&s;o is a Roman ca|tholic college, and at Marienrode a catholic con|vent. The Romi&s;h prie&s;ts of the church at Han|over are nominated by the elector. The Calvi|ni&s;ts, and other prote&s;tants &s;ects, together with the Jews, are tolerated and protected in the electo|ral territories. The Jews here, according to their cu&s;tom el&s;ewhere, are allowed to chu&s;e a rabbi, to decide their differences, and regulate what re|gards their ceremonies and religion.</P>
<P>It being incompatible with the propo&s;ed limits of this work to trace this illu&s;trious hou&s;e from its origin, we &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that it is, as might ea&s;ily be demon&s;trated, one of the mo&s;t antient and noble in Europe; that it is allied to, and has inter|married with, mo&s;t, if not all, the &s;overeign fa|milies in Chri&s;tendom. To go no farther back, the two remaining branches of this hou&s;e, viz. that of Brun&s;wic Wolfenbuttel and Beveren, which is the elder, and the electoral branch of Brun&s;wic Luneburg, are de&s;cended from the two &s;ons of Henry, duke of Zell, who flouri&s;hed in the be|ginning of the &s;ixteenth century. As to the elec|toral dignity, it was obtained in the year 1692, in a great mea&s;ure by the intere&s;t of William III. king of Great Britain, and prince of Orange. In that year, on the 17th of October, it was re|&s;olved in the college of electors at Rati&s;bon, that
<PB N="224" REF="2290">
the electoral dignity &s;hould be conferred on prince Erne&s;t, and his heirs; and in December follow|ing, the emperor gave him the inve&s;titure. The other colleges al&s;o of the empire, on the 30th of June, 1708, after the decea&s;e of the &s;aid elector, agreed to the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the new electorate in the per&s;on of his elde&s;t &s;on, king George I. of Great Britain, who then took his &s;eat in the diet as the ninth elector. His maje&s;ty has al&s;o, as elector, &s;everal votes in the diet of the empire in the college of princes and counts. He bears the title of arch-trea&s;urer of the empire equally with the elector Palatine; and the deputies of the elec|torate actually officiated as &s;uch at the coronation of the emperors Charles VII. and Francis I. For the defence of the empire, he contributes for all his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and their dependencies an electoral contingent, viz. &s;ixty hor&s;e, and two hundred and &s;eventy-&s;even foot; or, in lieu of them, one thou&s;and eight hundred and twenty-eight florins monthly. To the chamber of Witzlar he pays, for the whole electorate, eight hundred and eleven rix-dollars, fifty-eight kruitzers; but nominates at pre&s;ent, as the other electors his brethren, only one a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or. As proprietor of the duchy of Bre|men, he is, alternately with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, as duke of Magdeburg, director of the circle of Lower-Saxony, in the diet of which circle he enjoys five votes in the college of princes; and in that of We&s;tphalia one in the college of princes, and three in that of the counts. Pro|vided he continues always a prote&s;tant, he is in|titled to the bi&s;hopric of O&s;naburg alternately with a Roman catholic bi&s;hop. Further, he has the patronage of the town of Hilde&s;heim; and al&s;o jointly, with the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wic Wolfen|buttel, of the abbey of Corvey, and the town of Hozter belonging thereto, together with that of
<PB N="225" REF="2300">
the imperial city of Go&s;zlar. His title is duke of Brun&s;wic and Luneburg, arch-trea&s;urer and elector of the Holy Roman empire.</P>
<P>For the government of the electorate, the prin|cipal college, to which all the others are &s;ubordi|nate, is the privy council or regency, con&s;i&s;ting of nine coun&s;ellors, each of which has his depart|ment; but important matters are laid fir&s;t before the whole council, and then before his maje&s;ty, for his in&s;truction and approbation. The affairs of the church are managed by the con&s;i&s;tories and &s;uperintendants. The government of the &s;everal countries, which compo&s;e this electorate, is the lea&s;t de&s;potic of any in the empire; for the elec|tor cannot make laws, nor rai&s;e money, without the con&s;ent of the &s;tates. There are &s;everal civil courts of ju&s;tice, from all which an appeal lies to the &s;upreme court erected at Zell in 1711, the members of which are appointed partly by the &s;tates. From this court no appeal lies to the im|perial tribunals; for the emperors Charles VI. and Francis I. granted the electoral territories a power of determining finally all cau&s;es ari&s;ing within the &s;ame.</P>
<P>The revenues of the electorate, which are ma|naged by the board of trea&s;ury, and ari&s;e principally from the deme&s;nes, tolls, mines, &s;alt works, taxes on land, cattle, merchandi&s;e, and public hou&s;es, are computed to amount to at lea&s;t four hundred thou&s;and pounds a year.</P>
<P>The military e&s;tabli&s;hment of the electorate in time of peace is about twenty thou&s;and men, be|&s;ides the invalids and militia, which make a|bout &s;ix or &s;even thou&s;and. In time of war the elector can rai&s;e, without greatly burthening his &s;ubjects, thirty or forty thou&s;and men. As to the particular con&s;titution of the &s;everal countries, we

<HEAD>DUCHY of BREMEN.</HEAD>
<P>The duchy of Bremen has the We&s;er on the we&s;t; the Elbe and part of Lunenburg on the ea&s;t; the German &s;ea on the north; and part of Verden and Oldenburg on the &s;outh. Its greate&s;t length is about fifty miles, and breadth upwards of forty. The face of the country is entirely level, and well watered with rivers, the chief of which are the Elbe, O&s;te, and We&s;er. Along the&s;e rivers the lands are rich and fertile in corn, fruit, and pa&s;ture. But betwixt Bremen and Stade, the country is either a barren &s;and, or a mora&s;s. To guard the lands again&s;t inundations, to which they are expo&s;ed from the rivers, dykes and dams have been erected, and are kept in repair at a va&s;t expence. Abundance of cattle are fed in the mar&s;hes, and &s;heep on the heaths; and va&s;t quan|tities of turf are dug in the moors, which are either carried to Hamburg and Bremen, or con&s;umed at home. A great deal of flax is rai&s;ed in this coun|try, and &s;ome parts of it yield free-&s;tone, and clay for earthen ware. Its &s;ituation betwixt two navigable rivers has turned the thoughts of the people much to trade. It is &s;aid of them, however, that they will fight and drink with any in Germany.</P>
<P>Till the treaty of We&s;tphalia this country was &s;ubject to its archbi&s;hops; but was then &s;ecularized, converted into a duchy, and given to the Swedes, who continued ma&s;ters of it till 1712, when it was conquered, together with Verden, by the Danes, and both &s;old to the elector, George I. of Great-Bri|tain, for two hundred and fifty thou&s;and pounds, which he obtained from his parliament, the le|gi&s;lature
<PB N="227" REF="2320">
wi&s;ely judging, that it was greatly for the intere&s;t of the nation that a country lying on the Elbe and We&s;er, by which rivers a very valu|able trade is carried on to and from Great-Britain, &s;hould be in his hands. In 1719, the crown of Sweden had a million of rix-dollars, in lieu of all its rights and preten&s;ions to the duchies. The &s;tates of that of Bremen now con&s;i&s;t of the nobi|lity, and the deputies of the towns of Stade and Buxtehude, who&s;e privileges are the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Verden. An a&s;&s;embly of all the &s;tates, or a diet, cannot be held without the knowledge and con&s;ent of the regency; but the nobility may, and do a&s;&s;emble, twice a-year at Ba&s;dal, without giving the regency any previous notice. All the other inhabitants, be&s;ides tho&s;e that have a right to &s;it and vote in the diets, are taxable. The of|fice of hereditary cup-bearer belongs to the I&s;&s;en|dorf family; that of clerk of the kitchen to the Schultens vonder Luhs; and that of mar&s;hal to the barons of Marc&s;halke. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion here being Lutherani&s;m, in the whole duchy are one hundred and eleven Lutheran churches; which, with tho&s;e of Verden, are under one general &s;u|perintendant; but of Calvini&s;ts there are only &s;even congregations. At Bremen is a royal gymna&s;ium. The manufactures of the country con&s;i&s;t of linen, cordage, woollen cloth, and &s;tuffs. At Ammund, in the di&s;trict of Le&s;&s;um, is a &s;ugar-hou&s;e, and a manufacture of porcelain. The elector of Brun&s;|wic, as duke of Bremen, has a &s;eat and vote in the diet of the empire, and circle, of the la&s;t of which, as we have already ob&s;erved, he is alter|nately director with the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, as duke of Magdeburg. For the defence of the empire, his quota is four hor&s;e and one hundred foot; or, in lieu of them, &s;ix hundred and eighty-eight florins, monthly: and to the imperial chamber
<PB N="228" REF="2330">
his contribution is one hundred and eight rix|dollars, and twenty-two kruitzers. For the go|vernment of the duchy, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, there is a regency &s;ubordinate to that of Hanover, and a high court of ju&s;tice, from which an appeal lies to that called the high court of Ap|peals at Zell. The revenues here ari&s;e chiefly from the deme&s;nes, juri&s;dictions, regalia, exci&s;e, &s;tamp-duty, and contributions. As to the mili|tia, the &s;tates were formerly obliged to furni&s;h a corps of one hundred and thirty-&s;even hor&s;e, with cloathing and accoutrements; but now they pay thirty-three thou&s;and &s;even hundred and fifty rix|dollars in lieu of them. The principal places of the duchy are</P>
<P>Stade, which, next to the imperial city of Bre|men, is the chief town of the duchy, lies on the Schwinge, about a mile from where it falls into the Elbe, and is the &s;eat of the regency and other high colleges, being di&s;tant from Bremen forty|four miles, and from Hamburg twenty-&s;even. It was formerly the capital of a marqui&s;ate of its own name, an imperial city, and one of the Han&s;e|towns, and then had a great trade, and many pri|vileges; but afterwards fell to decay, as Ham|burg ro&s;e and flouri&s;hed. However, it is &s;till a large town, and in good condition. Here is a con|&s;iderable garri&s;on, which are lodged in barracks. The magi&s;trates have a juri&s;diction not only over the town, but a large di&s;trict, and levy a duty on all &s;hips and ve&s;&s;els that arrive there. Its pre&s;ent name is thought to be derived from Statio, the name given it by the Romans, becau&s;e part of their fleet was &s;tationed there, to guard the Elbe. Its decline was owing not only to the lo&s;s of trade, but partly al&s;o to fires and &s;ieges. In 1757, its fortifications were greatly improved, according to a plan laid before the king in 1755.</P>

<HEAD>BAILIWIC of WILDESHAUSEN.</HEAD>
<P>Tho' this bailiwic is at pre&s;ent no part of the duchy of Bremen; yet, as it belongs to the &s;ame &s;overeign, and was formerly included in the duchy, we &s;hall here give &s;ome account of it. It lies up|on the Hunte, and is entirely &s;urrounded by Oldenburg, Delmenhor&s;t, Diepholt, and the baili|wics of Vechte and Kloppenburg, belonging to the &s;ee of Mun&s;ter. Except on the rivers Hunte and Lethe, the &s;oil is very indifferent; notwith|&s;tanding, it produces rye, oats, buck-wheat, &s;heep, wool, wax, and honey, not only enough for the inhabitants, but, of &s;ome of them at lea&s;t, an overplus for exportation. In 1700 the crown of Sweden mortgaged the bailiwic, with all its de|pendencies, to the electoral hou&s;e of Brun&s;wic-Luenburg: and in 1720, at the peace of Stock|holm, made over all right and claim thereto, as well as to Bremen and Verden. The only place worth mentioning in it is that from which it takes its name, viz.</P>
<P>Wilde&s;hau&s;en, which lies on the Hunte, and contains about three hundred dwelling-hou&s;es, be&s;ides churches and other public buildings. One half of the inhabitants are papi&s;ts, who are allowed the exerci&s;e of their religion, but no bells, church|mu&s;ic, or proce&s;&s;ions; nor are they permitted to be married, buried, or bapti&s;ed, by their own prie&s;ts, but by a Lutheran mini&s;ter. Here was antiently a rich abbey and a ca&s;tle, which, toge|ther with the walls, are now in ruins.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of LUNEBURG-ZELL.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is bounded to the &s;outh by that of Calenberg, the dioce&s;e of Hilde&s;heim, and
<PB N="231" REF="2360">
the duchy of Brun&s;wic; to the north by the duchy of Lauenburg and the Elbe, by the la&s;t of which it is &s;eparated from the territory of the imperial city of Hamburg; to the ea&s;t by the duchy of Brun&s;wic, the Alte-Mark, and the duchy of Meck|lenburg; and to the we&s;t by the duchies of Bre|men and Verden, the county of Hoya, and the principality of Calenberg. The &s;oil, except along the Elbe, Aller, and Jetze, is either &s;and, heath, or moors. In the more fruitful parts of it are produced wheat, rye, barley, oats, peas, buck|wheat, flax, hemp, hops, pul&s;e, oak, beech, firs, pines, birch, and alder, together with black cat|tle and hor&s;es. The heaths abound with bees and honey, and a &s;mall kind of &s;heep, who&s;e wool is long and coar&s;e. Lunenburg is well furni&s;hed with &s;alt &s;prings and lime&s;tone, and the fore&s;t of Gorde with veni&s;on. The rivers Elbe, Ilmenau, and Aller, are navigable, and con&s;equently very advantageous to the country, independent of the fi&s;h which they yield. The general diets of this principality are convened by the &s;overeign twice a year, and held at Zell. They con&s;i&s;t of the deputies of the nobility and the towns of Lune|burg, Uelzen, and Zell, who have the nomina|tion of the members of the high colleges, and other officers, jointly with the &s;overeign. There are near two hundred Lutheran churches in the coun|try, under two general and fifteen &s;ubordinate &s;uperintendants, &s;everal grammar &s;chools, two Calvini&s;t churches at Zell, and an academy of exerci&s;es at Luneburg. The principal products of the country have been already mentioned. The manufactures are chiefly linen cloth, cottons, rib|bons, &s;tockings, hats, &s;tarch, bleached wax, refined &s;ugar, gold and &s;ilver wires, all kinds of wooden wares, barges, boats, and &s;hips. The exports of the&s;e to Hamburg, Lubec, and Altena, are con|&s;iderable.
<PB N="232" REF="2370">
The neighbourhood of the&s;e cities, with the facility of conveying goods and mer|chandize to them, and other places, either by land or water, is very advantageous to this coun|try, and contributes greatly to its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. On account of this principality, the king of Great Britain has a &s;eat and voice both in the college of the princes of the empire, and of the circle of Lower Saxony. Its quota in the Matricula is twenty hor&s;e, and one hundred and twenty foot, or &s;even hundred and twenty florins in lieu of them. The office of hereditary mar&s;hal here is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the family of the Medings; that of &s;ewer and cupbearer by the Behrens; that of arch trea&s;urer by the Kne&s;ebecks; and that of ta&s;ter by the Sporken family. The revenues of the principality ari&s;e chiefly from the deme&s;nes, tolls on the Elbe, contributions, duties on cattle, beer, wine, brandy, and other commodities, which altogether mu&s;t be very con&s;iderable, &s;ome baili|wics alone yielding upwards of twenty thou&s;and rix-dollars. The only places in it that merit par|ticular de&s;cription are,</P>
<P>Luneburg, the capital of the principality, a pretty large town on the river Elmen, or the Ilme|nau, which is navigable from the town to the Elbe, at the di&s;tance of thirteen miles. It is twenty|&s;even miles from Hamburg, forty-three from Zell, &s;ixty-five from Brun&s;wic, &s;eventy-&s;ix from Bremen, and &s;ixty-eight from Hanover. Its in|habitants are reckoned at between eight and nine thou&s;and. Formerly this town was one of the Han&s;e, and an imperial city. Some derive its name from Lina, the antient name of the Ilmenau; others from Luna, the moon, an image of which is &s;aid to have been wor&s;hipped by the inhabitants in the times of pagani&s;m. Here were antiently &s;everal convents, viz. one of Minims, another of
<PB N="233" REF="2380">
Premon&s;traten&s;ians, another of Benedictines, and a fourth of Minorites. Out of the revenues of the Benedictine mona&s;tery was founded an acade|my for the martial exerci&s;es, where young gen|tlemen of the principality of Luneburg are main|tained gratis, and taught French, fencing, riding, and dancing; but foreigners are educated at a certain fixed price. A Latin &s;chool was al&s;o founded, con&s;i&s;ting of four cla&s;&s;es, and well-en|dowed, out of the&s;e revenues. The &s;uperinten|dency and management of the&s;e, and the e&s;tates appropriated to their maintainance, belongs to the land&s;chaft director, and the au&s;reiter, who are both cho&s;en from among the Luneburg nobi|lity. The fir&s;t came in place of the popi&s;h abbot, and as &s;uch is head of the &s;tates of the principality, and pre&s;ident of the provincial college. He has the title of excellency, and in public in&s;truments &s;tiles him&s;elf, By the grace of God land&s;chaft di|rector, and lord of the man&s;ion of St. Michael in Luneburg. The chief public edifices are three pari&s;h churches, the ducal palace, three ho&s;pitals, the town hou&s;e, the &s;alt magazine, the anatomical theatre, the academy, the conventual church of St. Michael, in which lie interred the antient dukes, and in which is the famous table eight foot long, and four wide, plated over with cha&s;ed gold, with a rim embelli&s;hed with precious &s;tones, of an immen&s;e value, which was taken from the Saracens by the emperor Otho, and pre&s;ented to this church; but in 1698 a gang of thieves &s;tripped it of two hun|dred rubies and emeralds, together with a large diamond, and mo&s;t of the gold, &s;o that at pre&s;ent but a &s;mall part of it remains. Here are &s;ome very rich &s;alt &s;prings. Formerly, when there was a greater demand for the &s;alt, upwards of one hun|dred and twenty thou&s;and tons have been annually boiled here, and &s;old off: but &s;ince the com|mencement
<PB N="234" REF="2390">
of the pre&s;ent century, the &s;alt trade hath declined greatly. A fifth of the &s;alt made here belongs to the king, but is farmed out. Its &s;alt is &s;aid to excel all the other &s;alt made in Ger|many. This town is well fortified, and has a gar|ri&s;on, which is lodged in barracks. In the neigh|bourhood is a good lime&s;tone quarry; and along the Elmenau are warehou&s;es, in which are lodged goods brought from all parts of Germany, to be forwarded by the Elmenau to Hamburg, or by the A&s;che to Lubec, from whence other goods are brought back the &s;ame way. The town it&s;elf drives a con&s;iderable traffic in wax, honey, wool, flax, linen, &s;alt, lime, and beer.</P>
<P>Uelzen, a neat little compact town, at the conflux of the Wiper, and other rivulets, which form the Elmenau, twenty-&s;ix miles &s;outh of Lunenburg, and thirty-three north-ea&s;t of Zell. It was founded by Otho I. who in 1247 conferred on it a charter. The Elmenau was once navigable to the town, as appears by the remains of the ancient harbour &s;till to be &s;een: and in the great church hangs a &s;hip of gilt copper, pre&s;ented to the corporation by the En|gli&s;h, who traded thither. Here are &s;everal churches and alms-hou&s;es, a ducal palace, and Latin &s;chool. The town is a great thoroughfare, and was former|ly one of the Han&s;e. A very fine kind of flax grows in the neighbourhood, of which a great deal of li|nen is made. In 1750 the town had a new charter, compri&s;ing a plan for the more regular admini&s;tra|tion of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Zell, in Latin <HI>Cella,</HI> a well built, and well forti|fied town, on the Aller, where it is joined by the Fu&s;he, and becomes navigable, twenty-four miles north of Hanover, thirty-two north-ea&s;t of Brun&s;|wick, and thirty-five &s;outh of Lunenburg. It is ve|ry ancient, having a charter dated in 1203; and, in|cluding the &s;uburbs, contains about one thou&s;and
<PB N="235" REF="2400">
four hundred hou&s;es. The ramparts, which are planted with trees all round, are very high, and &s;o broad that coaches may go abrea&s;t on them. The chief public buildings in the town and &s;uburbs, are the ducal palace, which is walled and moated round, the provincial hou&s;e for the diets of the principality, &s;everal churches, a town-hou&s;e, ri|ding-hou&s;e, a mews, armoury, hou&s;e of correction, and &s;everal ho&s;pitals. In the &s;uburbs, in particular, are the Hotel des Invalides, the hou&s;e of correction, and the orphan-hou&s;e, well endowed. Here are al&s;o the king's &s;tables and park, in which are kept the &s;tallions for the &s;everal &s;tuds; the French garden, planted with delightful rows of lime-trees, and ano|ther le&s;&s;er one, called the Italian garden. The duke's and other gardens, orchards, and grottoes, render the &s;uburbs very plea&s;ant. A con&s;iderable trade is carried on here by the Aller; be&s;ides, it is a great thoroughfare, has &s;ome manufactures, par|ticularly of gold and &s;ilver, and is the &s;eat of the high court of appeals and other tribunals. Many French families, the de&s;cendants of refugees and others, are &s;ettled in the town. Great quantities of corn are &s;ent from hence to Bremen. The govern|ment and juri&s;diction of the town is partly ve&s;ted in the magi&s;trates, and partly in the burg-vogt, or ca&s;tellan, and the commi&s;&s;ary of police. In the neighbourhood is the ca&s;tle of Ahlen, where the heire&s;s of Luneburg-Zell, who was married to the elector George I. king of Great Britain, but afterwards divorced, died, after thirty years con|finement.</P>
<P>Harburg, a con&s;iderable town on the Seeve, near its influx into the Elbe, and almo&s;t oppo&s;ite to Hamburg, twenty-eight miles from Lunen|burg, and fifty from Zell. Here is a good har|bour and trade, being as advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated as Hamburg it&s;elf, to which boats pa&s;s from

<P>Dannenberg, which &s;tands in the mo&s;t ea&s;tern part of the duchy, on the river Jetze, &s;ix miles from its influx into the Elbe, and thirty-three &s;outh-ea&s;t from Lunenburg. It gives name to a rich and fruitful di&s;trict or bailiwic, and had an|tiently a ca&s;tle and counts of its own. Its name &s;ignifies a mountain of fir-trees. As the river Jetze is navigable, it is well &s;ituated for trade; but that chiefly carried on here is in beer. The noble family of Danneberg are proprietors of &s;ome lands in and near the town. In 1566 it became the re&s;idence of that line of Brun&s;wic-Luneburg, which is now called the Wolfenbuttel-line; but in 1671 was again annexed to the principality of Luneburg, one of the dukes of which purcha&s;ed it of its count in 1303.</P>

<P>Bardewick, in Latin Bardorum, on the Luhe, four miles from Lunenburg. Though it is now only a &s;traggling village, it was formerly a &s;trong populous city, and a bi&s;hop's &s;ee.

The mines and quarries are chiefly in the mountain and fore&s;t called the Hartz, in Latin, Sylva Hercynia, a part of which belongs to this principality, and which extends in length about fifty miles, and in breadth about eighteen. The principal rivers of this principality are, the Leine, the Oder, and Ocker.

<P>Herzberg, a large town &s;ituated on the Sieber, having a ca&s;tle, iron-works, and a linen manufac|ture. Round the town are pits always full of wa|ter, and well &s;tored with fi&s;h. The ca&s;tle was antiently the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the dukes of Gru|benhagen.</P>
<P>Scharzfels, a ca&s;tle &s;eated on a high rock upon the top of a mountain, which antiently gave title to counts, and a county. It is now &s;ometimes u&s;ed as a &s;tate-pri&s;on, and has a &s;mall garri&s;on. Near it are five caverns called the Scharzfeld caves, in which is found the ebur-fo&s;&s;ile, and abundance of drop-&s;tone. This ca&s;tle al&s;o gives name to a bai|liwic on the borders of the Harz, or Hartz, in which are copper and iron-works, chalk-pits, and quarries, with plenty of flax, and a linen manu|facture.</P>
<P>Lauterburg, or Lutterberg, a town &s;ituated on the Oder, which had formerly counts, and gave name to a county. It is now held as a fief of the abbey of Quedlinburg, and inhabited chiefly by

miners, and mine and fore&s;t-officers; for in its neighbourhood are &s;ome mines of copper and iron, with forges.</P>
<P>Elbingerode, a hand&s;ome little town, the &s;eat of a bailiwic, which abounds with woods of pine, and marble, &s;late, and iron-ore. There are al&s;o two warm &s;prings in it, and two kinds of ja&s;per are found in the ground and rivers. In this bai|liwic al&s;o, at the village of Luca&s;hof, is a mill for &s;awing marble, and making tables, &s;toves, &amp;c. of it; and at Luder&s;hof and the Neue-Hutte, are flatting-mills. At Konig&s;hoff, &s;tood antiently the palace of Konig&s;burg, where the kings and empe|rors of the Saxon race u&s;ed to re&s;ide, when they took the diver&s;ion of &s;tag-hunting in the neigh|bouring fore&s;t. The country hereabouts is held as a fief of the abbey of Gander&s;heim, upon which it was conferred by the emperor Henry II.</P>
<P>Clau&s;thal, an open &s;pacious mine-town, con|taining upwards of nine hundred hou&s;es, and about ten thou&s;and inhabitants. Here is a &s;ilver &s;melting hou&s;e, and a mint, in which between four and five hundred thou&s;and rix-dollars are an|nually coined, a &s;mall garri&s;on of invalids, two churches, an orphan-hou&s;e, grammar-&s;chool, and a mine and fore&s;t bailiwic-office for that part of the Harz belonging to the elector of Brun&s;wic. The air on the Hartz, for a great part of the year, is &s;o cold, and rain, &s;now, and fogs, &s;o frequent, that tillage and the cultivation of fruits turn to no account. The fore&s;t that covers the mountain con&s;i&s;ts of oak, beech, a&s;h, a&s;pin, alder, birch, pines, and firs. The great plenty of wood here is of the utmo&s;t importance, as without it the mine-works could not be carried on. The metals and minerals found in the&s;e mountains have been already mentioned. That called the Brun&s;wic-Luneburg Harz is divided into the upper and
<PB N="244" REF="2490">
lower, and belongs partly to the elector, and partly to the duke of Brun&s;wic. The &s;ame tract is al&s;o divided into mine and fore&s;t bailiwics, having its particular courts of ju&s;tice, civil and criminal, and its governors or directors, and other officers. The neat produce of the whole Brun&s;wic-Luneburg Harz, after a deduction of all charges, amounts to about four hundred and twenty-five thou&s;and, three hundred rix-dollars. The inhabitants of the Harz are compo&s;ed of miners, labourers in the &s;melting-hou&s;es, wood-hewers, carriers, the &s;ove|reign's officers and &s;ervants, mini&s;ters, &s;chool|ma&s;ters, and handicraft&s;men.</P>

<P>St. Andreasberg, another mine-town with a &s;il|ver &s;melting-hou&s;e, and a manufactory of powder|blue. Near this place is a re&s;ervoir, whence, by a canal, water is conveyed to all the mine|works; &s;o that, in the greate&s;t drought, they ne|ver want water.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of CALENBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is inter&s;ected by that of Wolf|enbuttel. Of the two parts, that which lies to|wards the north is &s;urrounded by the principality of Luneburg, the dioce&s;e of Hilde&s;heim, the principality of Wolfenbuttel, the counties of Pyrmont, Lippe, Schauenburg, Hoya, and the principality of Minden; but that towards the &s;outh, by the principalities of Wolfenbuttel and Grubenhagen, and the territories of Eichsfelde and Lower He&s;&s;e. Though a con&s;iderable part of this principality con&s;i&s;ts of barren mountains, moors, heaths, and &s;ands, yet there are a great many fruitful tracts in it, which yield plenty of corn, flax, pul&s;e, fruit, and tobacco. Nor is it without fine woods of oak, beech, alder, pine, birch, a&s;p, &amp;c. nor, con&s;equently, timber for building &s;hips or hou&s;es, wood for fuel and other u&s;es, and ma&s;tage for feeding hogs. Abundance al&s;o of black cattle, hor&s;es, and &s;heep, are bred in it, and it is well &s;upplied with veni&s;on, game, and fi&s;h. Further, in &s;everal places, are found marle, turf, coal-pits, &s;alt-&s;prings, quarries of free-&s;tone, mill &s;tone, and rich iron-ore. At Rehburg is al&s;o a medicinal &s;pring. In this principality are nineteen cities, of which tho&s;e of Gottingen, Ha|nover, Nordheim, and Hamelen, are called the great, and the others the &s;mall, and &s;eventeen towns. The e&s;tates are divided into the Ritter|ma&s;zige, which entitle the proprietors to a &s;eat and voice at the diets, and are exempt from all contributions; and the Freye, which neither en|title to a &s;eat, nor are exempt from contributions. In the principality are three prote&s;tant abbies and
<PB N="246" REF="2510">
&s;ix convents, of which three are inhabited by men, and five by women. Of the prelates, i. e. the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the abbies and convents, and the no|bility, i. e. the proprietors of the Ritterma&s;zige e&s;tates, and certain towns, are the &s;tates and diets compo&s;ed, which are held once a year at Hano|ver, con&s;i&s;ting of the repre&s;entatives of the&s;e &s;tates. The Lutherans, who&s;e religion is predo|minant here, have upwards of two hundred churches, exclu&s;ive of tho&s;e in the county of Spie|gelberg, which &s;hall be de&s;cribed in the circle of We&s;tphalia, with &s;uperintendants, general and particular, as in other Lutheran countries. The Calvini&s;ts have five churches, and the Roman ca|tholics &s;ix churches or chapels. For the education of youth, and the improvement of the &s;ciences, be&s;ides grammar-&s;chools in the chief towns, there is a flouri&s;hing univer&s;ity at Gottingen, with a royal academy of &s;ciences, and a royal German &s;ociety. The products of the country we have already mentioned. Of its manufactures, the principal are tho&s;e of wool, flax, cotton, &s;ilk, to|bacco, iron, copper, bra&s;s, gla&s;s, leather, &amp;c. The woollen cloths and &s;tuffs of Gottingen are &s;aid to equal tho&s;e of Holland, both in colour and finene&s;s, and yet are &s;old at a very moderate price. In different places of the principality, galloons, gold and &s;ilver lace, fringes, ta&s;&s;els, em|broideries, gunpowder, and &s;tone wares are made; likewi&s;e linen and carpets printed and painted, and ve&s;&s;els built for exporting the&s;e manufactures and commodities to Hamburg, Bremen, and other places by the We&s;er and Leine, and importing others, in which a large trade is carried on. This principality is a part of the duchy of Brun&s;wic, and includes in it the country of Gottingen, which was once a di&s;tinct principality, but has long been incorporated with Calenberg. In the year 1757,
<PB N="247" REF="2520">
it fell into the bands of the French, by which it &s;uffered greatly, though they were but a &s;hort time in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. The proprietor of it is intitled to a vote in the college of princes at the diet of the empire, and tho&s;e of the circle. Its marricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is twenty-two hor&s;e and a half, and one hundred and forty foot; or &s;ix hun|dred and eighty &s;ix florins monthly, in lieu of them. To the &s;upreme tribunal at Hanover it nominates two a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, and two to the high court of appeal at Zell. The &s;overeign's revenues ari&s;e chiefly from the deme&s;nes, the regalia, the exci&s;e on foreign brandies, and the greate&s;t part of tho&s;e di&s;tilled in the country. Here is al&s;o levied the military tax, called the licent, a &s;tamp-duty, a duty on corn, cattle, and &s;heep, with magazine and corn-money, &amp;c. The whole principality is divided into three quarters or departments, the principal places in which are,</P>
<P>Hanover, the capital not only of the principa|lity, but of the whole electorate, though in rank only the &s;econd of the four great cities in the prin|cipality. It was long the &s;eat of the dukes and electors, and once it was an imperial city, and one of the Han&s;e. It is divided into the old and new towns by the river Leine, which is here navigable for &s;mall boats, &s;tanding twenty-&s;ix miles from Zell, and about the &s;ame di&s;tance from Brun&s;wic. It had its name from a ferry here, Hanover former|ly, in the old Saxon, &s;ignifying the &s;ame as Have-Over in Engli&s;h. The &s;treets are regular, broad, and well lighted, but many of the hou&s;es are of timber and clay. The principal buildings are the electoral palace, which, having been de&s;troyed by fire, was, in 1741, rebuilt with great magnifi|cence. This palace fronts the Leine, and is richly furni&s;hed, and adorned with tape&s;try and paintings, a fine opera hou&s;e and theatre, a noble

collection of rarities, and medals ancient and mo|dern. In the church belonging to it, which is very &s;plendid, is kept a trea&s;ure of great value, con&s;i&s;ting of reliques, gold and &s;ilver plate, and gems, collected by duke Henry the Lion, in the Ea&s;t, in 1171, and the &s;ucceeding years. The other chief public and private &s;tructures are the armoury, the fine hou&s;e belonging to Mr. Bu&s;ch, the privy-coun&s;ellor, the &s;tately &s;tructure wherein the Calenberg diets are held, the elector's fine &s;tables, the Lockumer-hof, where the abbot of the convent of Lockum re&s;ides, the orphan-hou&s;e, the ho&s;pital of the Holy Gho&s;t, the hou&s;e of cor|rection, the &s;pinning-hou&s;e, the poor-hou&s;e, and &s;everal churches. All the&s;e &s;tand in the Al&s;tadt, or old town. In the New&s;tadt, on the other &s;ide the Leine, is the church of St. John's, the build|ing wherein the con&s;i&s;tory a&s;&s;embles, a large &s;tone edifice, in which are kept the electoral ar|chives and library, which is one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t &s;plendid in Germany, a free-&s;chool, a Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue, a Roman catholic and two Calvini&s;t churches, be&s;ides &s;everal palaces. In 1241 this town was transferred by Conrad, count of Lauen|rode, at that time proprietor of it, to duke Otho the Child. The great number of kitchen and plea&s;ure gardens, and fine &s;eats, make the envi|rons very plea&s;ant. Without the Steinthor, or Sone-gate, is a mo&s;t delightful vi&s;ta, leading to Mount Brillant and Herenhau&s;en, two electoral palaces. The gardens belonging to the latter are very noble. They contain one of the fine&s;t orangeries in Europe, a very grand jet d'eau, no|ble fountains, ba&s;ons, and ca&s;cades, a wilderne&s;s of evergreens, and a perfect theatre, with arbours and &s;ummer-hou&s;es on both &s;ides of it, for the actors to dre&s;s in.</P>

It lies in a fine country on the Hamel, whence it has its name, and which, after filling the town-moats, falls into the We&s;er, by which the town is wa&s;hed on the we&s;t. On the la&s;t of the&s;e rivers an admirable &s;luice was fini&s;hed in 1734, at the expence of eighty-thou|&s;and rix-dollars. Over it al&s;o is a bridge of nine

wooden arches. The other public edifices are the abbey, two Lutheran, and one Calvini&s;t church, a town-hou&s;e, a free-&s;chool, an ho&s;pital, and poor hou&s;e, with barracks for a whole battalion. The town has large privileges and a great e&s;tate, with the civil and criminal juri&s;diction within its liber|ties, which are exten&s;ive. Here are woollen, &s;ilk, and linen manufactures, a mint, and a great many leather dre&s;&s;ers. Within its liberties are &s;everal villages, fore&s;ts, and a ferry. The abbot of Fulda, who was formerly &s;overeign of the town, having &s;old it to the bi&s;hop of Minden, when the latter came to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, the citizens oppo&s;ed him, but were defeated, with great &s;laughter, near Sedemunde. This event is &s;uppo&s;ed, and not without probability, to have given ri&s;e to the &s;tory of the piper and children, of which the re|cords of the town are &s;aid to make mention, but fal&s;ely. The prior of the abbey, and the counts of Eber&s;tein, had al&s;o formerly &s;everal rights and prerogatives in the town; but the town-council, by degrees, acquired a right to mo&s;t of the&s;e.

<P>Gottingen, which gives name to the quarter, and is the chief of the four great towns in the princi|pality. It &s;tands on the New Leine, which is a canal drawn from the Old, about fifty miles from Hanover. It is one of the &s;tronge&s;t, be&s;t built, and paved towns, in all Lower Saxony. The an|tient gymna&s;ium here was, in 1734, converted, by his late maje&s;ty, king George II. into an uni|ver&s;ity; which, by the care of its pre&s;ent curator, baron Munch-hau&s;en, has acquired a great repu|tation. Its library belonging to it is &s;aid to be one of the be&s;t in Germany. Here is al&s;o a fine ob&s;ervatory, an anatomical theatre, a phy&s;ic gar|den, a &s;chool for teaching midwifry, an academy of exerci&s;es, &s;ciences, and belles lettres, and a German &s;ociety, which are all included under, and belong to the univer&s;ity. The Latin free-&s;chool has eight ma&s;ters, and is under very good regula|tions. Int his town are many flouri&s;hing manufac|tures, of which mention has been made already. The &s;moaked puddings or &s;au&s;ages made here, called in German, Gottingen Metwur&s;te, are in great

Here is a com|mandery of the Teutonic order, an armoury, &s;ix Lutheran, and one Calvini&s;t church, an alms|hou&s;e, with a church belonging to it, and an or|phan-hou&s;e. On a hill in the territory belonging to the town antiently &s;tood an imperial burg and palatine town, called Grone, which was the prin|cipal re&s;idence of the Saxon emperors after Otho the Great. The town's e&s;tate and juri&s;diction are very con&s;iderable, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal villages, woods, meadows, and pa&s;tures.

Here are &s;ome manufactures, a pari&s;h church, a free-&s;chool, and antiently there was a Benedictine convent for both &s;exes, founded in 1051 by Otho, duke of Bavaria.

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of WOLFENBUTTEL.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is a part of the duchy of Brun&s;wic, and is divided into two parts by the dioce&s;e of Hilde&s;heim, and the principality of Halber&s;tadt. That part which lies towards the north is &s;urrounded by the principality of Lune|burg, the mark of Brandenburg, the duchy of Magdeburg, the principality of Halber&s;tadt, and the dioce&s;e of Hilde&s;heim; by the two la&s;t of which, and the principalities of Grubenhagen and Calen|berg, the counties of Wernigerode and Lippe, and the territory of Corvey abbey, the &s;outh part is environed, which con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of hills and woods, &s;ome of which lie in the Harz, and contain rich mines and &s;alt works. On this
<PB N="257" REF="2620">
&s;ide are likewi&s;e &s;ome gla&s;s and porcelain manu|factures, but little corn land. The north part of the principality is more level, and produces con|&s;iderable quantities of grain, flax, hemp, pul&s;e, and fruit. Here al&s;o the breeding of cattle, and the culture of &s;ilk, are followed. The principal rivers by which the country is watered, are the We&s;er, Leine, Schunter, Ocker, and Aller. In the principality are ten boroughs, eight market|towns, three hundred and eighty-&s;ix villages, and &s;eventeen &s;ees and convents. The &s;tates of it con&s;i&s;t of the deans of the &s;ees and priors of the convents, the nobility who po&s;&s;e&s;s manors in the country, and the deputies of the olde&s;t towns. The&s;e &s;tates are divided into the greater and le&s;&s;er committee; and the diets, which are held at Brun&s;wic, meet four times a year. The e&s;tabli&s;h|ed religion here is Lutherani&s;m, under the in&s;pec|tion of general and &s;ubordinate &s;uperintendants. At Brun&s;wic, both the Calvini&s;ts and Papi&s;ts have each a church. The products of the country have been mentioned. As to manufactures, the chief are tho&s;e of flax, wool, &s;ilk, tobacco, gla&s;s, lead, iron, &s;teel, and other minerals. There is al&s;o a manu|facture of porcelain, and a wax bleachery. Brun&s;|wic is noted for its mum, and Konig&s;lutter for its beer. At the former of the&s;e towns are two great annual fairs. For the in&s;truction of youth, be&s;ides Latin &s;chools in &s;everal places, there is a college at Brun&s;wic, and an univer&s;ity at Helm|&s;tedt. This principality, which Henry the Mag|nanimous brought to the hou&s;e of Welpho, by marrying Gertrude, daughter to the emperor Lo|thario, gives a title to a vote among the princes, both at the diets of the empire, and tho&s;e of the circle. The hou&s;e of Wolfenbuttel, when the reigning prince happens to be older than that of Hanover, has the precedence at the diets, and the
<PB N="258" REF="2630">
joint directory of the circle. The matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment of the principality is twenty-two hor&s;e and a half, and one hundred and five foot, or in lieu of them &s;even hundred and thirty-four florins month|ly. To the chamber of Wetzlar it contributes two hundred and &s;eventy-eight rixdollars, thirty-&s;ix kruitzers. As to the hereditary officers here, the Olderhau&s;en family are hereditary mar&s;hals; that of Veltheim, &s;ewers; that of Schlie&s;tedt, cup|bearers; and that of Cramm, trea&s;urers. The high colleges for this principality are the privy council, the trea&s;ury, the convent-office, the chancery, the high-court of ju&s;tice, and the con|&s;i&s;tory for eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. A con&s;iderable part of the prince's revenues ari&s;es from the trea&s;ury-bai|liwics, regalia, and conventual e&s;tates. But there are al&s;o a great many taxes, exci&s;es, and impo&s;ts, levied upon the country. The duke's troops a|mount to above four thou&s;and men; and he is able to bring into the field twelve or fourteen thou&s;and. His court is numerous, and wants not for magnificence. His title is only that of duke of Brun&s;wic and Luneburg. The whole country is divided into four di&s;tricts, viz. tho&s;e of Wolfen|buttel, Schening, the Harz, and the We&s;er. In the fir&s;t the principal places are,</P>
<P>Brun&s;wic, the capital of the country, and the re&s;idence of the duke. It lies fifty-one miles we&s;t of Magdeburg, &s;ixty ea&s;t of the river We&s;er, &s;even|ty we&s;t of the Elbe, and had its name from Bruno, a duke of Saxony, who fir&s;t built it in 861. It was once an imperial city, and one of the Han&s;e; and tho' &s;till rich and populous, is much &s;hort of what it was when free. This city &s;tands upon the Ocker, is &s;trongly fortified, and pretty well built and paved; but the number of its inhabitants are not proportionate to its extent. It is divided into the Old and New Town, and is about two miles
<PB N="259" REF="2640">
in compa&s;s. Here are a great number of ingenious arti&s;ans, and &s;everal manufactures. Their chief trade is in leather, hops, butter, and the &s;trong beer, called mum, from its inventor Chri&s;tian Mum, of which great quantities are exported, even as far as A&s;ia. The chief public buildings are, the ducal palace, which is large and mag|nificent, richly furni&s;hed, and contains very fine pictures; a cabinet of curio&s;ities, and a &s;plendid library, in which are above a thou&s;and volumes of &s;carce and curious Bibles, or parts of Bibles, in &s;everal languages; an academy for martial exer|ci&s;es; the cavalier-hou&s;e; the armoury; Caroline|college, founded by the pre&s;ent duke; the new play-hou&s;e; the packhof, in which all goods im|ported or exported are rated and taxed, and which is &s;aid to yield two hundred thou&s;and rix-dollars per annum; the council hou&s;es in the New and Old-town; the hou&s;e of correction; the mint; the orphan-hou&s;e; ten Lutheran churches, (of which the cathedral, dedicated to St. Bla&s;ius, has a chapter, and contains the records of the electoral family of Brun&s;wic Luneburg, with the ducal burial place, and two fine large monuments of duke Henry the Lion, and his &s;econd con&s;ort; and in that of St. Giles's is a convent for twelve ladies, and a priore&s;s) a Calvini&s;t church, and another for the Roman catholics; two gymna&s;iums, with an anatomy and &s;urgery-&s;chool, the latter of which was found|ed by the pre&s;ent duke; a college for the &s;tudy of phy&s;ic, in&s;tituted in 1747, and a lazaratta, both built by the pre&s;ent munificent duke Charles. Add to the&s;e St. Leonard's ho&s;pital, the old ca&s;tle, called the Mo&s;thaus, or Mo&s;hof, and the Tem|plehof; the latter of which belonged antiently to the Knights Templars, but is now a college, con&s;i&s;ting of a dean, another eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and two lay members, who are u&s;ually magi&s;trates. The
<PB N="260" REF="2650">
chapter of the cathedral con&s;i&s;ts of a provo&s;t, a dean, a &s;enior, ten canons, and &s;everal inferior prebendaries and vicars. The dean is the fir&s;t member of the &s;tates. The Lutheran foundation of St. Cyriac con&s;i&s;ts of a dean, who is one of the &s;tates, and great committee, and of five canons. About two miles from Brun&s;|wic is the Lutheran convent of Riddag&s;hau&s;en, which is al&s;o one of the &s;tates, and a member of the greater committee. The ramparts of this city are planted with mulberry-trees, and the gardens be|longing to the ducal palace are laid out in an ex|qui&s;ite ta&s;te. Here in 1530 the fir&s;t &s;pinning-wheels were invented by one Jurgen, a &s;tone-cutter and &s;tatuary. This city was the fir&s;t of any note that embraced the Reformation. The road from hence to Wolfenbuttel is paved, and lined on both &s;ides with trees. The magi&s;tracy of the city are po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed of the high and low juri&s;diction, and it has likewi&s;e its own &s;uperintendant and &s;piritual court. In 1757 the French got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, but quit|ted it again in 1758. Without St. Peter's-gate is the Lutheran convent of Heiligen Kreuz, or Holy-Cro&s;s, which has a church of its own.</P>
<P>Wolfenbuttel, which &s;tands on the Ocker, &s;e|ven miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Brun&s;wic, and gives name to the principality, is the &s;eat of &s;everal high colleges, and formerly had dukes of its own, who became extinct in 1735. The principal public edifices here are the ca&s;tle, where the duke u&s;ed generally to re&s;ide, the ar&s;enal, the duke's library, which is one of the be&s;t in Germany, the great ducal &s;chool, the riding-&s;chool, and &s;everal churches, of which the principal is that called the great church, dedicated to Our Lady. The Ocker has been made navigable betwixt this town and Brun&s;wic. There is a good garri&s;on here as well as at Brun&s;wic, and the town is &s;o well fortified, that it is reckon|ed one of the &s;tronge&s;t in Germany. It is not half &s;o big as Brun&s;wic, and the hou&s;es are mo&s;tly of
<PB N="261" REF="2660">
timber. The furniture and paintings of the palace, and that of Salzdalum, about a league from the town, are extremely fine, as well as the cabinet of rarities. In the ducal library, be&s;ides a va&s;t col|lection of other books and manu&s;cripts, are forty|one volumes, writ by the learned duke Augu&s;tus, the founder of it, twelve of which are on mu&s;ic, with a Commentary on Trithemius's Cryptography, and a very learned tract on the antiquity and my&s;|tery of the game of che&s;s. At a &s;mall di&s;tance from hence is the Lutheran abbey of Steterburg, con&s;i&s;ting of an abbe&s;s, a provo&s;t, and &s;everal la|dies, which has a repre&s;entative in the diet.</P>

<P>Salzdalum, a village, which gives name to a bailiwic, and takes its own from a con&s;iderable &s;alt-work in its neighbourhood. The magnifi|cent ducal palace here, already mentioned, contains in its gallery above one thou&s;and pictures, by the be&s;t ma&s;ters, be&s;ides tho&s;e in the le&s;&s;er gal|lery. In the china cabinet are above eight thou|&s;and pieces of exqui&s;ite beauty; and, in another, above a thou&s;and enamels of Raphael de Urbino, admirably executed. The great gallery is two hundred feet long, fifty broad, and forty high; and the le&s;&s;er one hundred and &s;ixty long, and twenty broad. In the latter, be&s;ides the above cabinet, are &s;ix &s;mall ones for curio&s;ities of art and nature. The gardens too, and the chapel, are extremely grand. Adjoining to the palace is a convent, founded by duke Anthony Ulrich and his duche&s;s, and dedicated to the Virgin Mary, in which there is a domina, fifteen &s;i&s;ters of no|ble families, with a provo&s;t: it al&s;o &s;ends a re|pre&s;entative to the diets.</P>

It is near forty miles in length, and thirty in breadth. The bailiwic of Werfer|lingen lies &s;eparate on the Aller. The &s;oil is very fertile both in corn, gra&s;s, and flax, inter&s;per&s;ed with &s;ome woods; notwith&s;tanding, in general, there is a &s;carcity of fuel, as well as of fi&s;h and game. The chief river in it is the Bode. The prin|cipality is, for the mo&s;t part, level, and feeds abun|dance of &s;heep. There are three large towns in it, which &s;end repre&s;entatives to the diet, toge|ther with ten &s;mall ones, and ninety-nine country towns and villages. The number of the inhabi|tants are reckoned at about two hundred thou&s;and. The &s;tates con&s;i&s;t of the prelates, that is, the chapters and convents; the nobility, who are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of manors; and the magi&s;trates of Halber|&s;tadt, A&s;cher&s;leben, and O&s;terwick. The diets are u&s;ually held four times a year. The greate&s;t part of the inhabitants are Lutherans, with a mixture of Roman catholics, Calvini&s;ts, and Jews. The manufactures are principally woollen, and the chief exports are grain, and the beer called broihan. Till the treaty of We&s;tphalia in 1648, this country was a dioce&s;e, but was then trans|ferred to the electoral hou&s;e of Brandenburg, as a temporal principality. It is entitled to a vote both in the diet of the empire and that of the circle.

Its matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is fourteen hor&s;e and &s;ixty|&s;ix foot, or four hundred and thirty-two florins monthly, in lieu of them, exclu&s;ive of that for the county of Regen&s;tein, and the lord&s;hips of Lora and Klettenberg. To the chamber of Wetzlar it con|tributes each term one hundred and &s;ixty-two rix|dollars, twenty-four kruitzers. The family of Ro&s;z|ing are hereditary mar&s;hals, and the Schenks, of Flechtingen, cup-bearers. The annual revenue ari&s;ing from this principality, and the incorporated counties and lord&s;hips, is &s;aid to amount to five hundred thou&s;and rix-dollars.

It was formerly an im|perial city, and is now the &s;eat of the regency and the high courts and offices. It was long the &s;ee of a bi&s;hopric, founded in the beginning of the ninth century by Lewis I. &s;on of Charlemagne. The bi&s;hops were mo&s;tly of the Brun&s;wic family, and more eminent for their military than epi&s;copal talents. Though the number of the inhabitants is not quite two thou&s;and, there are within and with|out the town &s;ixteen churches. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are old fa&s;hioned. The principal public edifices are the cathedral of St. Peter's, an old but &s;tately &s;tructure, two old epi&s;copal palaces, a great many Lutheran and Calvini&s;t churches, &s;everal Roman catholic convents, a Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue, three Lu|theran Latin &s;chools, &s;everal ho&s;pitals, be&s;ides an orphan-hou&s;e and pri&s;on.

On the Burg-&s;quare are hand|&s;ome hou&s;es for the canons and prebendaries, with a nunnery. Several of the Lutheran churches are collegiate. The convents have a juri&s;diction within their re&s;pective liberties. In 1758, this town was very &s;everely treated by the French, who demoli&s;hed its walls and gates.

<HEAD>DUCHIES of SCHWERIN and GUSTRO, or the DUCHY of MECKLENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e duchies are bounded by Pomerania on the ea&s;t; by part of the marqui&s;ate of Brandenburg, and the duchy of Lunenburg, on the &s;outh; the Baltic on the North; and Hol&s;tein, and Saxe-Lawenburg, on the We&s;t. Their greate&s;t length is about a hundred and twenty miles, and greate&s;t breadth upwards of &s;ixty. With re&s;pect to the &s;oil, much cannot be &s;aid in favour of it, as it con&s;i&s;ts in general, either of &s;and, or large and de&s;olate heaths, inter&s;per&s;ed with moors, woods, fens, and lakes. It yields very little wheat, and not a great deal of oats, rye, and barley; but breeds a con&s;iderable number of &s;heep and cattle, has plenty of fi&s;h, with &s;tone|quarries,
<PB N="269" REF="2740">
&s;alt-&s;prings, alum, iron, and &s;ome copper. The principal rivers here are the Elde and Stor, which fall into the Elbe, as it glides along the borders of this country to the &s;outh-we&s;t; the Rec|kenitz, which di&s;charges it&s;elf into the Baltic; as do the Peene, the Warno, and the Stopenitz. This coun|try has only one harbour on the Baltic, namely that of Ro&s;tock. In both duchies, exclu&s;ive of Ro&s;tock, are forty-five great and &s;mall cities, with three convents, and a great number of manors and farms, belonging either to the duke, the nobility, or convents. The pea&s;ants are in a &s;tate of vil|lainage; but the nobility-enjoy very con&s;iderable privileges. The &s;tates are compo&s;ed of the no|bility and towns, and the diets, which are &s;um|moned annually, are held alternately at Sternberg, and Malehin. The duchy of Schwerin appoints four provincial coun&s;ellors, and that of Gu&s;tro, as many, who rank, according to &s;eniority, with the duke's actual privy-coun&s;ellors, as their mar&s;hals do with the colonels. The le&s;&s;er committee repre&s;ents the whole body of the nobility and commons, by whom the members are cho&s;en freely, and with|out controul, and no edict relative to the whole country can be publi&s;hed without their con&s;ent, or in prejudice of their rights. The inhabitants of this country are mo&s;tly Lutherans, under their &s;uperintendants. There are al&s;o &s;ome Calvini&s;ts and Roman catholics. Be&s;ides the grammar-&s;chools in the towns, there is an univer&s;ity at Ro&s;tock. The commodities of the duchy are corn, flax, hemp, hops, wax, honey, cattle, butter, chee&s;e, wool, and wood, a part of which is exported, but hardly any manufactures.</P>
<P>Of the hou&s;e of Mecklenburg, there are two lines &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ting, viz. that of Schwerin and Strelitz. The latter commenced in duke Adolphus
<PB N="270" REF="2750">
Frederick II. younger brother of the duke of Schwerin, and grand-father of the pre&s;ent duke of Strelitz, Adolphus Frederick IV. who entered on the government in 1752, and who&s;e family hath lately received a great additional lu&s;tre by his Britannic maje&s;ty's taking his &s;econd &s;i&s;ter for his con&s;ort, and by her own great merit and noble deportment in that high &s;tation. Be&s;ides the duchy of Strelitz, to this duke belong the prin|cipality of Ratzeburg, with the lord&s;hip of Stargard, the antient commanderies of Miro, and Nemero, and a yearly pen&s;ion of nine thou&s;and dollars out of the Boitzenburgh toll. The title a&s;&s;umed by both the dukes is duke of Mecklen|burg, prince of Wenden, Schwerin, and Ratze|burg, count of Schwerin, and the country of Ro&s;tock, and lord of Stargard. By the agree|ment concluded at Witt&s;tock in 1442, the elector of Brandenburg, on the extinction of the male-line of the dukes of Mecklenburg, is intitled to their whole &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The duke of Schwerin has two votes both in the diet of the empire and that of the circle. The matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment for the duchies of Schwerin and Gu&s;tro is forty hor&s;e and &s;ixty-&s;even foot, or &s;even hundred and forty-eight florins monthly, including what is paid by Swe|den for Wi&s;mar, and the bailiwics of Poll and Neuklo&s;ter. To the chamber of Wetzlar the&s;e two duchies pay each two hundred and forty-three rix-dollars, forty-three kruitzers. For the govern|ment of Mecklenburg, the admini&s;tration of ju&s;|tice, and the management of the revenue, there is the privy-council of regency, the deme&s;ne cham|ber, the high and provincial court of ju&s;tice, to which appeals lie in mo&s;t ca&s;es, both from the con&s;i&s;tory and the inferior civil courts, and which are common to both the dukes. As to the reve|nues, tho&s;e of the Schwerin line mu&s;t be very con|&s;iderable,
<PB N="271" REF="2760">
tho&s;e ari&s;ing from the deme&s;ne bailiwics and regalia alone, amounting to three hundred thou&s;and rix-dollars per annum. There is a tax on land that produces no contemptible &s;um, and that called the prince&s;s's tax is fixed at twenty thou&s;and rix-dollars: be&s;ides all the&s;e, there are al&s;o free gifts. The whole revenues of the Strelitz branch are e&s;ti|mated at an hundred and twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and rix-dol|lars. Each of the&s;e princes maintains a body of troops. Their principalities are divided into three circles, of which that of Mecklenburg is the fir&s;t, and contains the following places:</P>
<P>Parchim, &s;ituated in the principality of Wenden, on the river Elde, which divides it into the old and new town. Here was once a ca&s;tle and a mint. It has now two churches.</P>
<P>Schwerin, which is the u&s;ual re&s;idence of that branch of the ducal family to which it gives name, &s;tands on a great lake of that name; eighteen miles &s;outh of Wi&s;mar, thirty &s;outh-ea&s;t of Lubeck, and thirty-eight &s;outh-we&s;t of Ro&s;tock. It was an|ciently the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop; but was &s;ecularized at the treaty of O&s;naburg, and given to the duke of Mecklenburg as an equivalent for Wi&s;mar. The duke's palace here &s;tands on an i&s;land in the lake, but has a communication with the town by means of a bridge: it contains a valuable collec|tion of paintings, has fine gardens, and commands a delightful pro&s;pect. The town and county, to which it gives name, had long counts, or graves, of their own.</P>
<P>Gadebu&s;ch, a &s;mall town with a ca&s;tle. Rede|ga&s;t, the idol of the Wends, is &s;aid to have been wor&s;hipped here in a wood; and that from thence the town had the name of Gadebu&s;ch or Ged&s;bu&s;h. In 1712 the Swedes defeated the Danes near this place.</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="2770">
Rhena, a &s;mall town on the river Radega&s;t Here was antiently a Benedictine nunnery.</P>
<P>Greve&s;muhlen, or Grevi&s;mohlen, in Latin <HI>Comi|tis Mola,</HI> a &s;mall town, in the antient duchy of Mecklenburgh.</P>
<P>Buko, Kropelien, and Bruel, &s;mall towns in the &s;ame duchy.</P>
<P>Kriewitz, a &s;mall town, in the antient county of Schwerin.</P>
<P>Sternberg, a &s;mall town, on a lake, in the prin|cipality of Wenden. Here, and at Malchin, the diets are alternately held.</P>
<P>Wittenburg, a &s;mall town, in the county of Schwerin.</P>
<P>Boitzenburg, a &s;mall town, in the &s;ame county, on the little river Boitze, from which it has its name. Here is a priory, and a toll on the Elbe, producing upwards of forty thou&s;and rix-dollars; of which the duke of Mecklenburgh-Strelitz is entitled to nine thou&s;and, by the convention of Hamburgh in 1701. How it came to be mortgaged to the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wic-Luneburg will appear in the &s;equel.</P>
<P>Domitz, a &s;mall town, in the old principality of Wenden. Here is a ca&s;tle, and a toll on the Elbe.</P>
<P>Hageno, a &s;mall town, in the antient county of Schwerin.</P>
<P>Grabo, a &s;mall town, in the principality of Wenden. The &s;eat here is a&s;&s;igned to the duche&s;s|dowager.</P>
<P>Neu&s;tadt, and Lyoz, &s;mall towns on the Elbe.</P>
<P>Mecklenburgh, now a village, in the neigh|bourhood of Wi&s;mar; but antiently a large town, as its name imports: hence in Latin it is called Megapolis, and gave name to the duchy, and title to the dukes. Formerly it had three convents, and was the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop; but gra|dually declined, as Wi&s;mar ro&s;e. The bailiwic to which it gives name, is one of the eight, the revenues

of which, together with the toll of Boitzenburg, were a&s;&s;igned in 1734, by the emperor, to the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick, in con&s;ideration of the expences in|curred by it in executing the ban in 1732 again&s;t the duke; but the nine thou&s;and dollars of that toll, to which the duke of Mecklenburg-Strelitz is entitled, are to be deducted, and duly paid.</P>
<P>Dobberan, now a hunting-&s;eat, in the lord&s;hip of Ro&s;tock, about half a mile from the Baltic; but antiently a celebrated Ci&s;tercian mona&s;tery. In the church here are interred two kings of the Obotrites, twelve lords of Worle, &s;everal princes of Mecklenburg, and other per&s;ons of note. Along the Baltic coa&s;t, in the neighbourhood, runs the celebrated Heiligen Damm, being a natural wall of &s;tones, of mo&s;t beautiful imagery and colours.</P>
<P>Eldena, a village on the Elda, where was for|merly a Benedictine nunnery. It now gives name to a bailiwic, in which is a &s;alt-work, and a hill containing alum.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The SECOND, or WENDEN CIRCLE, contains the following places:</HEAD>
<P>Gu&s;tro, a pretty large town, &s;eventeen miles &s;outh of Ro&s;tock, eighteen &s;outh-we&s;t of Wi&s;mar, and thirty-&s;even from Schwerin. It is the &s;eat of the chief courts of judicature, and had formerly dukes of its own. The ca&s;tle here is &s;aid to be a grand edifice, with a mo&s;t elegant garden. In the church is the burial-place of the ducal family.</P>
<P>Krako, a &s;mall town &s;eated on a lake, to which it gives name.</P>
<P>Goldberg, a &s;mall town in the principality of Wenden.</P>

<P>Ivenack, a market-town not far from Staven|hagen.</P>
<P>Dargun, or Dragun; now a ducal palace, but formerly a Benedictine mona&s;tery, in the lord&s;hip of Ro&s;tock, not far from the Cummeroe-lake.</P>
<P>Ro&s;tock, the large&s;t town in both duchies, lying on the river Warno, at the mouth of which, eight miles below, it has a harbour, named Warne|munde. It is divided into three parts, the old,
<PB N="275" REF="2800">
the middle, and new towns. Here are a great many churches. In St. Mary's, a &s;tately &s;tructure, are pre&s;erved the entrails of the celebrated Grotius, who died in 1645. At that of the Holy-cro&s;s, is a convent for young ladies, natives of Ro&s;tock. The univer&s;ity here, which was founded in 1419, has, for the&s;e two la&s;t centuries, been one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing in Germany. Its profe&s;&s;ors are nominated and paid, partly by the dukes, and partly by the town. Here is al&s;o a free-grammar|&s;chool. The town has great privileges, among others, that of coining copper, &s;ilver and gold, yet the dukes are &s;overeigns of it. Its magi&s;tracy are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the civil and criminal juri&s;diction, but an appeal lies from them to the two &s;upreme courts of judicature, as well as from the con&s;i&s;tory.</P>
<P>The dukes have a palace here, which was for|merly the re&s;idence of the abbot of Dobberan. Ro&s;tock carries on a large trade, e&s;pecially in beer, formerly called Lubeck beer, of which they ex|port great quantities. The river is navigable for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els up to the town, but large &s;hips come no further than Warnemunde. There are &s;even bridges here over the river. This town had once lords of its own, and was al&s;o formerly one of the Han&s;e, and a free imperial city; and has now a large territory and e&s;tate belonging to it. Near the mouth of the river the Swedes had a fort, where they levied a toll, which, when the trade of this city was in a more flouri&s;hing &s;tate, amounted yearly to upwards of eighty thou&s;and rix-dollars; but now produces only &s;ix thou&s;and, whence it ap|pears how much the trade of the town is declined. This toll and fort, in 1740, were mortgaged to the duke of Mecklenburg.</P>
<P>Dobbertin, a Lutheran convent for ladies, in the principality of Wenden, not far from Gold|berg, was antiently a mona&s;tery of Bene|dictine
<PB N="276" REF="2810">
monks, but afterwards converted into a nunnery of that order.</P>

<HEAD>In the THIRD CIRCLF, or that of STARGARD, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places are:</HEAD>
<P>New Brandenburgh, the capital of the circle, &s;tanding on a lake. In its neighbourhood grow great quantities of hops. This town &s;ends a de|puty to the le&s;&s;er committee of the &s;tates, has two churches, a grammar-&s;chool, and a &s;uper|intendency.</P>
<P>Frienland, a &s;mall town on a lake, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Stargard, or Old Stargard, a &s;mall town, which gives name to the lord&s;hip and circle, and near which is a ducal palace.</P>
<P>Strelitz, a town &s;ituated in a mar&s;hy neighbour|hood, and giving title to a branch of the ducal family, to whom it, and all the re&s;t of this circle, belongs. It con&s;i&s;ts of Old and New Strelitz, which &s;tand at a &s;mall di&s;tance from each other. The prince's palace is at the latter of the&s;e, which, as it has not been long built, makes a hand&s;ome appearance, and has plea&s;ant gardens.</P>
<P>Fur&s;tenberg, a &s;mall town, which antiently had counts of its own.</P>
<P>We&s;enberg, a &s;mall town, having a fertile &s;pot for its territory, called Pomel.</P>
<P>Nemero, antiently a commandery of the order of St. John, but now a bailiwic belonging to the Strelitz branch, who are al&s;o proprietors of the town and bailiwic of Miro, formed, like the former, out of a commandery of the order of St. John. At Miro is a ducal &s;eat.</P>
<P><PB N="277" REF="2820">
The following places, formerly belonging to the Duchy of SCHWERIN, were, at the peace of We&s;tphalia, ceded to Sweden, viz.</P>
<P>Wi&s;mar, a large town betwixt Ro&s;tock and Lubeck, twenty-five miles we&s;t of the former, and ea&s;t of the latter, and &s;eventy-three north ea&s;t of Hamburgh. It was formerly one of the chief Han&s;e towns, and the harbour for their men of war; for it &s;tands on a bay of the Baltic, &s;till enjoys a middling trade, and is the &s;eat of a Swedi&s;h court of ju&s;tice, both for the di&s;trict and Swedi&s;h Anterior Pomerania. It is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been built in the thirteenth century, out of the ruins of Mecklenberg. In 1648, it was given to the Swedes by the treaty of Mun&s;ter. For|merly it had the &s;ame privileges as Lubec, par|ticularly that of coining. By the treaty made in 1720, when it was re&s;tored to the Swedes, its walls and fortifications were entirely demoli&s;hed. Here, in 1758, the Pru&s;&s;ians rai&s;ed large contri|butions. The town has &s;ix churches, and a grammar-&s;chool under the direction of eight ma&s;ters, and its territory is con&s;iderable. Be&s;ides this town and its territories, the two adjoining bailiwics of Poel and Neuklo&s;ter, were al&s;o ceded to the crown of Sweden by the &s;ame treaty.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The DUCHY of HOLSTEIN, including the lord&s;hip of PINNEBERG, and the town of ALTENA.</HEAD>
<P>The boundaries of this duchy are the Ger|man ocean on the we&s;t; the Baltic, or the gulph of Lubeck, on the ea&s;t; the duchy of Mecklenberg on the &s;outh-ea&s;t; that of Bre|men, with the river Elbe, on the &s;outh we&s;t; and Lauenburg, with the territory of Ham|burg,
<PB N="278" REF="2830">
on the &s;outh. Its greate&s;t length is about eighty miles, and its breadth &s;ixty. The dioce&s;e of Eutin, and the county of Ranzau, though they make a part of the duchy of Hol&s;tein, yet being lands belonging to the empire and circle, &s;hall be de&s;cribed &s;eparately.</P>
<P>A great part of this country con&s;i&s;ts of rich mar&s;h-land, which being much expo&s;ed to inun|dations both from the &s;ea and rivers, dykes have been rai&s;ed at a great expence, to guard and defend them. The pa&s;tures in the mar&s;hes are &s;o rich, that cattle are bred in great numbers, and fattened in them; and great quantities of excellent butter and chee&s;e made of their milk. They are al&s;o very fruitful in wheat, barley, pea&s;e, beans, and rape-&s;eed. In the more barren, &s;andy, and heathy parts of the country, large flocks of &s;heep are bred and fed; nor are orchards wanting, or woods, e&s;pecially of oak and beech; nor turf, poultry, game, and wild fowl. Here is a variety both of &s;ea and river fi&s;h; and the beef, veal, mutton, and lamb, are very fat and palatable. Hol&s;tein is al&s;o noted for beautiful hor&s;es. The gentry u&s;ually farm the cows upon their e&s;tates to a Hollander, as he is called, who for every cow pays from &s;ix to ten rix-dollars; the owner providing pa&s;ture for them in &s;ummer, and &s;traw and hay in winter. It is no uncommon thing here, to drain the ponds and lakes once in three or four years, and &s;ell the carp, lampreys, pikes and perch found in them; then &s;ow them for &s;everal years after with oats, or u&s;e them for pa&s;ture, and after that to lay them under water again, and breed fi&s;h in them. There are hardly any hills in the country, but &s;everal rivers, of which the principal are the Eyder, the Stor, and the Trave. The duchy contains about thirty towns great and &s;mall: mo&s;t part of the pea&s;ants are under villenage, being
<PB N="279" REF="2840">
obliged to work daily for their lords, and not even at liberty to quit their e&s;tates. The nobility and the proprietors of manors are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the civil and criminal juri&s;diction, with other privileges and exemptions. Formerly there were diets, but now they &s;eem to be entirely laid a&s;ide: meetings, how|ever, of the nobility are &s;till held at Kiel. The pre|dominant religion here is Lutherani&s;m, with &s;uper|intendencies, as in other Lutheran countries. In &s;everal places the Jews are allowed the exerci&s;e of their religion. At Gluck&s;tadt, and Altena, are both Calvini&s;t and Popi&s;h churches; and at Kiel, a Greek Ru&s;&s;ian chapel. Be&s;ides the Latin &s;chools in the towns, at Altena is a gymna&s;ium, and at Kiel an univer&s;ity. Notwith&s;tanding this country's advantageous &s;ituation for commerce, there are few manufactures and little trade in it. Hamburg and Lubec &s;upply the inhabitants with what they want from abroad; from whence and Altena, they export &s;ome grain, malt, grots, &s;tarch, buck|wheat, pea&s;e, beans, rape&s;eed, butter, chee&s;e, &s;heep, &s;wine, horned cattle, hor&s;es, and fi&s;h. The manufactures of the duchy are chiefly carried on at Altena, Kiel, and Gluck&s;tadt. The duchy of Hol&s;tein con&s;i&s;ts of the antient provinces of Hol&s;tein, Stormar, Ditmar&s;h, and Wagria. It belongs partly to the king of Denmark, and partly to the dukes of Hol&s;tein Gottorf, and Ploen. Antiently the counts of Hol&s;tein were va&s;&s;als of the dukes of Saxony; but afterwards they received the inve&s;titure of their territories from the emperor, or the bi&s;hops of Lubec, in the emperor's name, though now the inve&s;ti|ture is given by the emperor in per&s;on. The king of Denmark appoints a regency over his part of Hol&s;tein and the duchy of Sle&s;wick, which has its office at Gluck&s;tadt. The &s;eat of the great duke's privy-council, and regency-court, together
<PB N="280" REF="2850">
with the chief con&s;i&s;tory, which is united to it, is at Kiel; there are many inferior courts and con&s;i&s;tories from which an appeal lies to the higher. In the duchy of Hol&s;tein, the government of the con|vents and nobility is alternately in the king and duke, for a year, from Michaelmas to Michaelmas. The per&s;on in whom the government is lodged, admini&s;ters it by his regency. In &s;ome ca&s;es an appeal lies from this court to the Aulic council, or chamber at Wetzlar: the convents, the nobility, and the proprietors of manors in the country, have a civil and criminal juri&s;diction over their e&s;tates. The revenues of the &s;overeigns ari&s;e principally from their deme&s;nes and regalia; be&s;ides which there is a land, and &s;everal other taxes and impo&s;ts. The duke's income, &s;etting a&s;ide his ducal patri|mony, has been e&s;timated at &s;eventy or eighty thou&s;and pounds. The king u&s;ually keeps here &s;ome regiments of foot and one of hor&s;e. With re&s;pect to the duke's military force, it amounts to about eight hundred men.

<P>Gluck&s;tadt, on the north-&s;ide of the Elbe in Stor|mar, twenty-&s;ix miles &s;outh-we&s;t of Hamburg, is a neat well built town, and &s;o &s;trong, that it may be &s;aid to be impregnable, unle&s;s blocked up by a fleet. It held out near two years again&s;t the emperor Ferdinand II. The Danes have generally two thou&s;and men in garri&s;on in it, and &s;ome men of war in the harbour; which is &s;o &s;pacious, that it could receive a royal navy. The Calvini&s;ts have a church here, the Roman Catholics a chapel, and the Jews a &s;ynagogue. The town was built in 1620, when Chri&s;tian IV. ordered it to be called Gluck|&s;tadt, i. e. the Fortunate-town. The neighbour|ing country is &s;o mar&s;hy, that it could not be pa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t part of the year without the cau&s;eway, which lies betwixt Gluck&s;tadt and Krempe. It is al&s;o much expo&s;ed to inundations. A toll is levied here on the Elbe. There being no &s;prings about the town, the inhabitants u&s;e rain water, or that of the river. Tho&s;e that are convicted of theft are condemned for life to draw the du&s;t-carts, to which they are chained, like galley-&s;laves. This town is the &s;eat of the regency and other high colleges.

Hilde&s;heim, in length, is about forty miles, and in breadth thirty. The &s;oil is abundant|ly fertile in grain, flax, hops, pul&s;e, woods of oak, beech, a&s;h, and birch. In &s;ome places there are &s;alt|works with &s;tone quarries, and iron ore; but of hor&s;es, black cattle, &s;heep, and hogs, there is no great plenty. Be&s;ides the above-mentioned rivers, it is al|&s;o watered by the Inner&s;te, the Ecker, and the Fu&s;e. In the dioce&s;e are eight boroughs, four market-towns, two hundred and forty-eight villages, and &s;e|venty-five manors, which entitle to a &s;eat in the diets. The &s;tates con&s;i&s;t of the clergy, i. e. the cathedral chapter and abbies, the nobility, and the towns of Hilde&s;heim, Peina, Elze, and Alfeld. The diets are convened by the bi&s;hop alone, and held generally once a year at Hilde&s;heim. The greate&s;t part of the inhabitants of this dioce&s;e, which was founded by Charlemagne, and is &s;till &s;ubject to a popi&s;h bi&s;hop, are Lutheran, who are intitled, by the treaty of We&s;tphalia, to the free ex|erci&s;e of their religion. Of the Lutheran religion are all the towns, with the greate&s;t part of the nobility, and mo&s;t of the villages, under five &s;uper|intendants, and two con&s;i&s;tories. The manufac|tures of this country are ordinary cloth, fine linen, wor&s;ted &s;tockings, a coar&s;e porcelain, and all kinds of iron ware, of which, and its natural products, a part is exported. The bi&s;hopric was founded by the emperor Charlemagne, and was antient|ly of great extent; but the dukes of Brun&s;wic afterwards got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a part of it. The bi&s;hop has a &s;eat and vote, both in the diets of the empire, and the circle.

<HEAD>DUCHY of SAXE-LAUENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is the farthe&s;t province to the north|ea&s;t of the king of Great-Britain's German domi|nions. It lies on the north and &s;outh banks of the Elbe, between Hol&s;tein on the we&s;t and north, Mecklenburg on the ea&s;t, and Lunenburg on the &s;outh. This country is not very fertile in grain; but in &s;ome places yields plenty of flax, in others fine woods, and in many parts, particularly on the banks of the Elbe, good pa&s;turage, where likewi&s;e abun|dance of cows are kept, which are let out at five or &s;ix rix-dollars per annum each, as in Hol&s;tein. There are &s;ome lakes here, and &s;mall rivers, be|&s;ides the Elbe, which abound in fi&s;h. In the whole duchy, which is from eight to twenty-&s;ix miles broad, and about eighty in length, are three bo|roughs, one market-town, and about thirty-&s;ix thou&s;and &s;ouls. The &s;tates are compo&s;ed of the nobility and towns. The manors entitling to a &s;eat and vote in the diets, are twenty-three. Both the nobility and commons derive their privileges from the Lauenburg act of 1702, which king George I. and his &s;ucce&s;&s;or, were graciou&s;ly plea&s;ed to con|firm in all its articles. The inhabitants are all Lutherans, under the in&s;pection of a &s;uperinten|dant, who is appointed by the king, and vi&s;its the &s;everal pari&s;hes once a-year. There is no place of any note without a Latin &s;chool for the in&s;truction

Julius Francis, duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, dying in 1689, without male-i&s;&s;ue, in con&s;equence of an agreement concluded with the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wic-Luneburg in 1369, George William, duke of Zell, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the duchy, and in 1697, accommodated matters with the elector of Saxony, who claimed it, by virtue of a rever&s;ion granted to his ance&s;tors by the emperor Maximilian I. After the death of the duke of Zell, it devolved to his &s;on-in-law, and nephew, king George I. of Great-Britain, to whom the late emperor Charles VI. granted the inve&s;ti|ture of it, with a &s;eat and vote in the diet of the empire, and circle. Its matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is eight hor&s;e and thirty foot, or two hundred and &s;ixteen florins monthly in lieu of them. To the chamber of Wetzlar it contributes two hundred and forty-three rix-dollars, forty-three kruitzers. For the government of the duchy, and the admi|ni&s;tration of ju&s;tice, there is a regency, &s;ubordinate that of Hanover, and a high tribunal, the mem|bers of which are appointed partly by the king, and partly by the &s;tates; but an appeal lies from it to the high court of appeals at Zell. The duchy has al&s;o a con&s;i&s;tory of its own. All the&s;e colleges meet at Ratzeburg.

It is very fertile; abounds in grain, fruit, cattle, and fi&s;h; and has its particular courts, eccle&s;ia&s;tical and civil, of which the gre&s;e, appointed by the &s;overeign, is pre&s;ident, and from which appeals lie to the Lauenburg high court of judicature at Ratzeburg. The in|habitants are all Lutherans, under two &s;uperin|tendants, and a con&s;i&s;tory. The revenues of the whole county, ari&s;ing from the contribution and land-tax, amounts to about ten thou&s;and rix-dol|lars. The only place in it de&s;erving of notice is Otterndorf, a &s;mall town, &s;eated on the Meden.</P>

<HEAD>ARCHBISHOPRIC of LUBEC.</HEAD>
<P>This archbi&s;hopric, which lies in that part of the duchy of Hol&s;tein called Wagria, was fir&s;t erected at Oldenburg by the emperor Otho I. but having been afterwards divided into three bi&s;hoprics, viz. tho&s;e of Oldenburg, Ratzeburg, and Mecklen|burg, the &s;ee of the fir&s;t was removed to Lubec. At the Reformation the bi&s;hop, chapter, and dio|ce&s;e, embraced Lutherani&s;m; and at the peace of We&s;tphalia in 1648, the &s;ee was confirmed to the prote&s;tants. The bi&s;hops almo&s;t ever fince the Reformation, have been de&s;cendants of the hou&s;e of Hol&s;tein-Gottorf; from whence likewi&s;e &s;prung Henry-Frederic-Augu&s;tus, the pre&s;ent bi|&s;hop, who is al&s;o brother to the king of Sweden; but
<PB N="294" REF="2990">
in 1756, the chapter made choice of Frederic, &s;on to Frederic the late king of Denmark, and half-brother of the pre&s;ent king, for his coadjutor. The bi&s;hop of Lubec is a prince of the empire, and has a &s;eat and vote as &s;uch, in the diets of the empire and circle. His matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is three hor&s;e, or thirty-&s;ix florins; and to the chamber of Wetz|lar he contributes forty rix-dollars, fifty-two kruitzers. The cathedral &s;tands in the imperial city of Lubec, and the chapter con&s;i&s;ts of thirty per&s;ons, all Lutherans, except four. The dean is always elected from among the members of the chapter. The provo&s;t of the cathedral is cho&s;en alternately by the chapter and the city of Lubec. In the lands belonging to the bi&s;hop and chapter, the only place worth mentioning is</P>
<P>Eutin, where the bi&s;hop re&s;ides, and which is al&s;o the &s;eat of the regency, trea&s;ury, and con|&s;i&s;tory. It is a &s;mall town, very plea&s;antly &s;ituated on a lake, which abounds with fi&s;h. The bi&s;hop's palace and gardens are very hand&s;ome and agree|able.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of SCHWERIN.</HEAD>
<P>This country is &s;urrounded by the duchy of Schwerin, and the lord&s;hips of Wi&s;mar and Ro|&s;tock. Its length is about twenty miles, and its breadth &s;ix. It was formerly a bi&s;hopric, the &s;ee of which was at Schwerin; but at the peace of We&s;tphalia was &s;ecularized, and given to the dukes of Mecklenburg, of the Schwerin line, with a &s;eat and voice on account thereof in the diets of the empire and circle. Its matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is &s;ix hor&s;e, and as many foot, or ninety-&s;ix florins monthly in lieu of them. To the chamber of Wetzlar it contributes eighty-one rix-dollars, four|teen kruitzers. The principal places in it are,</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="3000">
Butzo, a &s;mall town, where the bi&s;hops former|ly re&s;ided, and in which &s;ome manufactures are now carried on.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of RATZEBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality, which lies between the du|chies of Saxe-Lauenburg and Schwerin, and the territory of the city of Lubec, and is about &s;ix miles in length and breadth, con&s;i&s;ts, as we ob&s;erved in the de&s;cription of Ratzeburg, of the antient bi&s;hopric of that name, which was &s;ecularized at the peace of We&s;tphalia, and given to the duke of Mecklenburg Schwerin; but afterwards, by the convention of Hamburg in 1701, came to the Strelitz line, which, on account of it, has a &s;eat and voice in diets of the empire and circle. Its matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is one hor&s;e and three foot, or twenty-four florins; and to the chamber of Wetzlar it contributes &s;ixty-&s;even rix-dollars, fifty-four kruitzers. A part of the town of Ratzeburg belongs to the principality, and there the regency, trea&s;ury, and con&s;i&s;tory are held. The only other place in it that merits notice is Sconberg, a &s;mall town, where was antiently an epi&s;copal palace, and which now gives name to a bailiwic.</P>

<HEAD>PRICIPALITY of BLANKENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality, which is &s;ituated in the ea&s;t part of the duchy of Brun&s;wic, and includes in it part of the Harz, is about twenty miles in length,
<PB N="296" REF="3010">
but in general not above &s;ix in breadth. That part of it which lies in the Harz, abounds with woods, marble, and iron ore, but has little or no corn land; whereas the other part is fruitful in grain. It had for a long time counts of its own; on the extinction of whom, in 1599, it devolved to the dukes of Wolfenbuttel; and in 1731 fell to the reigning Bevern branch. In 1707 the em|peror Jo&s;eph erected it into a principality; but the duke of Brun&s;wic has not yet obtained a &s;eat or voice in the diet of the empire on account of it. To a Roman month it pays only twelve florins. This principality, as to its government, is under the privy-council at Brun&s;wic, but has a di&s;tinct court of ju&s;tice and a con&s;i&s;tory. The only places in it of any account are,</P>
<P>Blankenburg, a &s;mall town, which gives name to the principality, and has a ducal palace on an eminence without the town.</P>
<P>Ha&s;&s;eldfelde, a little place, &s;ituated in the Harz, where the duke has a hunting-&s;eat.</P>

<HEAD>COUNTY of RANZAU.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which lies in the duchy of Hol|&s;tein, and is about ten miles in length, and &s;ix broad, is tolerably fertile. It was formerly called the bailiwic of Barm&s;tedt; but after it had been &s;old to Chri&s;tian Ranzau, &s;tadtholder to the king of Denmark, it was erected into a county of the empire by the emperor Ferdinand III. In con&s;e|quence of a &s;ettlement made by count Ranzau, that it &s;hould devolve to the royal family of Den|mark, upon the failure of male i&s;&s;ue in his own,
<PB N="297" REF="3020">
the county now belongs to the king, who on ac|count of it has a &s;eat in the diets of the empire and circle. To the chamber of Wetzlar it pays twenty|nine rix-dollars, &s;eventy-&s;ix kruitzers, is governed by an admini&s;trator appointed by the king, and has a con&s;i&s;tory and other courts, for the trial of cau&s;es civil and criminal. The revenues ari&s;ing from it amount to about fourteen thou&s;and rix|dollors per annum. The places which merit de|&s;cription in it are,</P>
<P>Barm&s;tedt, a market-town on the Aue.</P>
<P>Elm&s;horn, another market-town on the Aue, which being navigable for &s;mall ve&s;&s;els from hence to the Elbe, a little trade is carried on by it from hence. The head mini&s;ter of the church here is &s;uperintendant of the whole county.</P>

<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of LUBEC.</HEAD>
<P>This city &s;tands at the conflux of &s;everal rivers, the large&s;t of which is the Trave, twelve miles from the Baltic, where it has a fine harbour, and forty north-ea&s;t of Hamburg. By the Steckenitz, another of tho&s;e rivers, it has a communication with the Elbe, and con&s;equently with the German ocean. The city lies on the &s;ide of a hill, with the Trave, increa&s;ed by the Steckenitz on one &s;ide, and the Wackenitz on the other, and is &s;trongly fortified with ba&s;tions, moats, walls, and ramparts; the la&s;t of which are planted with trees, and form an agreeable walk. Lubec being for|merly the chief of the Han&s;e-towns, was very powerful, in con&s;equence of the va&s;t trade it carried on; but a great part of that trade is now tran&s;|ferred to Hamburg: however, it is &s;till &s;aid to employ one hundred and fifty of its own &s;hips, and has a great &s;hare of the Baltic trade. It is about two miles in length, and more than one in breadth. The hou&s;es are all of &s;tone, but old fa&s;hioned.
<PB N="298" REF="3030">
Several of the &s;treets have on each &s;ide rows of lime-trees, with canals in the middle, like tho&s;e of Holland. The public &s;tructures con&s;i&s;t of the antient cathedral of the bi&s;hopric of Lubec, and &s;everal other Lutheran churches; a nunnery for twenty two ladies, with an abbe&s;s and priore&s;s; a poor-hou&s;e, an alms-hou&s;e, and hou&s;e of cor|rection; an orphan-hou&s;e; an ho&s;pital dedicated to the Holy-Gho&s;t; a hou&s;e in which poor travellers are entertained three days, and then &s;ent forward with a pa&s;s; but &s;uch as happen to be &s;ick, are provided with all nece&s;&s;aries, till they recover or die; the city armoury; a grammar-&s;chool of &s;even cla&s;&s;es; the Calvini&s;t church, and the Popi&s;h chapel. The deputies of the Han&s;e-towns u&s;ed to meet here formerly in the town-hou&s;e. An alli|ance &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts between Lubec, Hamburg, and Bremen; and the&s;e cities, under the name of Han&s;e-towns, negotiate treaties with foreign powers. Here are divers manufactures, and the city's territory is about &s;ixty miles in compa&s;s. In the diet of the empire Lubec is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the third &s;eat among the Rheni&s;h imperial cities; and among tho&s;e of the circle, has the fir&s;t. In the matricula, its a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is four hundred and eighty florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar it pays five hundred and fifty-&s;even rix-dollars and eighty-eight kruitzers. The city is a republic within it|&s;elf, and both makes and executes laws in regard to civil and criminal matters, &amp;c. A father and &s;on, or two brothers, cannot be in the regency at the &s;ame time. The famous league of the Han&s;e-towns was begun here in 1164. This city had its charter of privileges from the emperor Frederic II. Formerly it carried on wars, both offen&s;ive and defen&s;ive, for &s;everal years, not only again&s;t the dukes of Mecklenburg, but again&s;t the kings of Sweden and Denmark, particularly in 1428, when
<PB N="299" REF="3040">
it fitted out two hundred and fifty &s;hips of force again&s;t Eric X. king of Denmark. There are about twenty churches in Lubec, with lofty &s;teeples or &s;pires. The Trave brings &s;hips of burden into the very heart of the city; but the large&s;t unload at Travemunde, i. e. the mouth of the Trave, eight or ten miles di&s;tant. Formerly it is &s;aid to have employed no le&s;s than &s;ix hundred &s;hips. In the famous cellar here, it is &s;aid there is wine two hundred years old. The church of St. Mary's, a noble lofty pile, is &s;upported by tall pillars, all of one &s;tone each, and has a high &s;pire, covered with gilt lead. The town's garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of about &s;even or eight hundred men. The revenue of its Lutheran bi&s;hop, tho' he is a prince of the em|pire, is &s;aid not to exceed three thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>Among other places dependent on Lubec is Travemunde, mentioned above, a &s;mall town, with a fort, at the influx of the Trave into the Baltic. In the fort is commonly a garri&s;on of three or four hundred men, commanded by a burgher of Lubec. The town was purcha&s;ed by that city in the year 1320, of John III. count of Hol&s;tein. There is another &s;mall place, called Bergedorf, which, with its bailiwic, belongs in common to Hamburg and Lubec, being a con|que&s;t made by their joint forces from the duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg.</P>

<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of GOSZLAR.</HEAD>
<P>This city is &s;urrounded with the territories of Hilde&s;heim and Wolfenbuttel, and lies twenty-two miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Hilde&s;heim, twenty-five &s;outh of Brun&s;wic, and twenty-&s;ix we&s;t of Halber&s;tadt, on the river Go&s;e, which, at a little di&s;tance, falls into the Ocker. It enjoys the &s;ame privileges as other free imperial cities, be&s;ides an exemption
<PB N="300" REF="3050">
from tolls in mo&s;t of the markets of the empire. The city &s;tands in a valley, &s;urrounded with mountains, in which are mines both of iron and &s;ilver, where mo&s;t of the inhabitants are employed in digging, or in clean&s;ing, &s;melting, tempering, and vending the metals and minerals; for they farm &s;ome of the mines from the elector of Hanover. Here are &s;everal Lutheran foun|dations both for men and women, of which the former hold immediately of the empire; as al&s;o a con&s;iderable brewery of beer, of which, and other provi&s;ions, the miners in the Harz take off large quantities. Go&s;zlar owes its foundation to the emperor Henry I. in the year 922. In the Koning&s;hof, or king's court, &s;everal kings and emperors of Germany have kept their court, and held a&s;&s;emblies of the empire. This city, in the diet, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;eventh &s;eat on the bench of the imperial cities of the circle of the Rhine; and among tho&s;e of Lower Saxony has the &s;econd. Its matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is only &s;ixty florins, and its quota to the chamber of Wetzlar is one hundred and eighty-four florins, &s;eventy|nine kruitzers. The protector&s;hip of it belongs to the duke of Brun&s;wic-Wolfenbuttel, to whom, on that account, the inhabitants pay an annual &s;um of money. No religion is tolerated here but the Lutheran. It was in this place that Barthold Schwartz, the Benedictine monk, is &s;aid to have found out the art of making gunpowder.</P>

It is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the ninth place on the Rheni&s;h bench of imperial-cities in the diets of the empire, and of the third in tho&s;e of Lower Saxony. Its matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is one hundred and &s;ixty flo|rins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar it contributes one hundred and thirty-five rix-dollars, twenty|three kruitzers. This place is under the protection of the elector of Saxony, and has a con&s;iderable terri|tory.

<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of NORDHAUSEN.</HEAD>
<P>This city &s;tands on the Zorge, twenty-one miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Go&s;zlar; and both magi&s;tracy and inhabitants are Lutherans. Formerly it was one of the Han&s;e-towns, and &s;till carries on a good trade to the Upper Harz, di&s;tills great quantities of brandy, and is noted for curious works in mar|ble and alaba&s;ter. In 1717 the elector of Bran|denburg, in con&s;ideration of the &s;um of fifty thou|&s;and rix-dollars, transferred to the city and its magi&s;tracy, all his rights and prerogatives in it. In the diet of the empire it has the tenth &s;eat on the Rheni&s;h bench of imperial cities, and the fourth among tho&s;e of Lower Saxony. Its matri|cular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is eighty florins, and to the cham|ber of Wetzlar it pays ninety-four rix-dollars, &s;ixty|two kruitzers.</P>

<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of HAMBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This city, which derives its name from the old German word Hamme, &s;ignifying a wood, and Burg, a ca&s;tle, &s;tanding on the north-&s;ide of the Elbe, twenty-&s;even miles north-we&s;t of Lunen|burg, thirty-&s;even &s;outh-we&s;t of Lubeck, fifty-five
<PB N="302" REF="3070">
north of Zell, &s;ixty-five north-ea&s;t of Bre|men, &s;eventy-two from the mouth of the Elbe, one hundred and fifty-five &s;outh-we&s;t of Copenha|gen, one hundred and ninety-five north-ea&s;t of Am&s;terdam, and four hundred and &s;ixteen north-we&s;t of Vienna, on the borders of that part of Hol&s;tein called Stormar. The Elbe, which, op|po&s;ite the city, is not le&s;s than four miles broad, not only forms two &s;pacious harbours, but runs thro' mo&s;t part of it, in canals. It flows above Hamburg many miles; but when the tide is accompanied with north-we&s;t winds, a great deal of damage is done by the inundations occa&s;ioned thereby. There are a great many bridges over the canals, which are mo&s;tly on a level with the &s;treets, and &s;ome of them have hou&s;es on both &s;ides. In the year 833, Ludovicus Pius erected Ham|burg fir&s;t into a bi&s;hopric, and afterwards into an archbi&s;hopric; and Adolphus III. duke of Saxony, among many other great privileges, granted it the right of fi&s;hing in the Elbe, eight miles above and below the city. The kings of Denmark, &s;ince they have &s;ucceeded to the counts of Hol&s;tein, have continually claimed the &s;overeignty of this place, and often compelled the citizens to pay large &s;ums to purcha&s;e the confirmation of their li|berties. Nay, it has more than once paid homage to the king of Denmark, who, notwith|&s;tanding, keeps a mini&s;ter here with credentials, which is a &s;ort of acknowledgment of its inde|pendency and &s;overeignty. Though Hamburg has been con&s;tantly &s;ummoned to the diet of the empire ever &s;ince the year 1618, when it was de|clared a free imperial city, by a decree of the au|lic council, yet it waves this privilege, in order to keep fair with Denmark. The emperor Sigi&s;mund granted it the privilege of coining gold and &s;ilver money; and by the emperor Frederic I. the citi|zens
<PB N="303" REF="3080">
were exempted from paying any tolls on the Elbe. By their &s;ituation among a number of poor princes, they are continually expo&s;ed to their rapa|ciou&s;ne&s;s, e&s;pecially that of the Danes, who have extorted va&s;t &s;ums from them. The city is very po|pulous, in proportion to its bulk; for though one may walk with ea&s;e round the ramparts in two hours, yet it contains, exclu&s;ive of Jews, at lea&s;t one hundred thou&s;and inhabitants. Here are a great many charitable foundations, the regula|tions of which are greatly admired by foreigners. All per&s;ons found begging in the &s;treets are com|mitted to the hou&s;e of correction to hard labour, as the ra&s;ping of Bra&s;il and other kinds of wood. There is an ho&s;pital into which unmarried women may be admitted for a &s;mall &s;um, and comfortably maintained during the re&s;idue of their lives. The number of ho&s;pitals in this place is greater in pro|portion to its bigne&s;s, than in any other prote&s;tant city in Europe. The revenue of the orphan-hou&s;e alone is &s;aid to amount to between fifty and &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds. There is a large &s;umptuous ho&s;pital for receiving poor travellers that fall &s;ick. In one of their workhou&s;es or hou&s;es of correction, tho&s;e who have not performed their ta&s;k, are hoi&s;ted up in a ba&s;ket over the table in the com|mon hall, while the re&s;t are at dinner, that they may be tantalized with the &s;ight and &s;mell of what they cannot ta&s;te. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of Ham|burg is Lutherani&s;m; as for the Calvini&s;ts and the Roman catholics, they go to the amba&s;&s;adors cha|pels to celebrate their divine &s;ervice and wor&s;hip. They have here what they call a private confe&s;&s;ion, previous to the holy communion, which differs in nothing from that of the church of England, which is general, and the ab&s;olution is the &s;ame, only the poore&s;t of the people here are forced to give a fee to the prie&s;t on the&s;e occa&s;ions. Their
<PB N="304" REF="3090">
churches, which are antient large fabrics, are open thoroughfares, and in &s;ome there are book&s;ellers &s;hops. The pulpit of St. Catha|rines is of marble, curiou&s;ly carved and adorned with figures and other ornaments of gold; and its organ, reckoned one of the be&s;t in Europe, has &s;ix thou&s;and pipes. The cathedral is very antient, and its tower leans as if ju&s;t going to fall; yet, on account of the &s;ingularity and beauty of its archi|tecture, the danger attending it has been hitherto overlooked. There is &s;till a dean and chapter be|longing to this church, though &s;ecularized, from who&s;e court there lies no appeal, but to the impe|rial chamber at Wetzlar. The chapter con&s;i&s;ts of a provo&s;t, dean, thirteen canons, eight minor canons, and thirty vicarii immunes, be&s;ides others who are under the juri&s;diction of the city. The cathedral, with the chapter, and a number of hou&s;es belonging to them, are under the immediate protection of his Britannic maje&s;ty as duke of Bremen, who di&s;po&s;es of the prebends that fall in &s;ix months of the year, not &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, but al|ternately with the chapter. Hamburg is almo&s;t of a circular form, and &s;ix miles in compa&s;s. It has &s;ix gates, and three entrances by water, viz. two from the Elbe and one from the Al&s;ter, being di|vided into the old and new, which are &s;trongly fortified with moats, ramparts, ba&s;tions, and out|works. The ramparts are very lofty, and planted with trees, and of &s;uch a breadth, that &s;everal carriages may go a brea&s;t. In the new town, to|wards Altena, are &s;everal &s;treets of mean hou&s;es inhabited by Jews. Through that entrance from the Elbe called the lower Baum, pa&s;s all &s;hips going to or coming from &s;ea. Every morning at the opening of it is &s;een a multitude of boats and &s;mall barks, who&s;e cargoes con&s;i&s;t of milk, fruits, and all kind of provi&s;ions, ru&s;hing in at the &s;ame

time. There are &s;ome fine chimes here, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of St. Nicholas, which play every morning early, at one o'clock in the afternoon, and on all fe&s;tivals and &s;olemnities. The other public &s;truc|tures in this city, be&s;ides the churches, make no great appearance: however, the yard, ar&s;enal, and two armories, are well worth &s;eeing. There are &s;everal convents or cloi&s;ters &s;till remaining, which having been &s;ecularized, are now po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Lutherans. One of them holds its lands by this tenure, That they offer a gla&s;s of wine to every malefactor who is carried by it for execution. There is a fine exchange, though inferior to that of London. It is the cu&s;tom of Hamburg, that a citizen, when he dies, mu&s;t leave the tenth of his e&s;tate to the city; and foreigners, not naturalized, mu&s;t pay a certain &s;um annually for liberty to trade. The common carts here, are only a long pulley laid upon an axle-tree between two wheels, and drawn not by hor&s;es but by men, of whom a dozen or more are &s;ometimes linked to the&s;e machines, with &s;lings acro&s;s their &s;houlders. Such of the &s;enators, principal elders, divines, regular phy&s;icians, and graduates in law, as a&s;&s;i&s;t at funerals have a fee. The hangman's hou&s;e is the common pri&s;on for all malefactors, on whom &s;entence is always pa&s;&s;ed on Friday, and on Monday they are executed. As, by their laws, no criminal is puni&s;hable unle&s;s he plead guilty, they have five different kinds of torture to extort &s;uch confe&s;&s;ion. The government of this city is lodged in the &s;enate and three colleges of burghers. The former is ve&s;ted with almo&s;t every act of &s;overeignty, except that of laying taxes and managing the finances, which are the prerogatives of the latter. The magi&s;tracy is compo&s;ed of four burgoma&s;ters, four &s;yndics, and

twenty-four aldermen, of whom &s;ome are lawyers and &s;ome merchants. Any per&s;on elected into the magi&s;tracy, and declining the office, mu&s;t depart the place. No burgher is admitted into any of the colleges, unle&s;s he dwells in a hou&s;e of his own within the city, and is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of one thou&s;and rix-dollars in &s;pecie, over and above the &s;um for which the hou&s;e may be mortgaged, or two thou|&s;and in immovable goods, within the juri&s;diction of the &s;ame. For the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, here are &s;everal inferior courts, from which an appeal lies to the Obergericht, or high court, and from that to the aulic council, and other imperial col|leges. For naval cau&s;es here is a court of admi|ralty, which, jointly with the city trea&s;ury, is al|&s;o charged with the care of the navigation of the Elbe, from the city to the river's mouth. In con|&s;equence of this one hundred large buoys, &s;ome white, others black, are kept con&s;tantly floating in the river in &s;ummer; but in winter, in&s;tead of &s;ome of them, there are machines, like tho&s;e called ice beacons, to point out the &s;hoals and flats. Sub|ordinate to the admiralty is a company of pilots, and at the mouth of the Elbe, is, or at lea&s;t ought to be, a ve&s;&s;el always riding, with pilots ready to put on board the &s;hips. At the mouth of the river al&s;o is a good harbour, called Cuxhaven, belonging to Hamburg, a light-hou&s;e, and &s;everal beacons, &s;ome of them very large. For defraying the ex|pence of the&s;e, certain tolls and duties were for|merly granted by the emperors to the city. Be|&s;ides the Elbe, there is a canal by which a com|munication is opened with the Trave, and there|by with Lubeck and the Baltic, without the ha|zard, trouble, and expence of going about by the Sound. The trade of Hamburg is exceeding great, in exporting all the commodities and manu|factures

of the &s;everal cities and &s;tates of Germany, and &s;upplying them with whatever they want from abroad. Its exports con&s;i&s;t of linens of &s;everal &s;orts and countries, as lawns, diapers, O&s;naburgs, dowlas, &amp;c. linen, yarn, tin-plates, iron, bra&s;s and &s;teel wire, clap-board, pipe-&s;taves, wain&s;cot|boards, oak-plank and timber, kid-&s;kins, corn, beer in great quantities, with flax, honey, wax, ani&s;eed, lin&s;eed, drugs, wine, tobacco, and me|tals. Its principal imports are the woollen manu|factures and other goods of Great Britain, to the amount of &s;everal hundred thou&s;and pounds a|year; they have al&s;o a great trade with Spain, Por|tugal, and Italy, which is carried on mo&s;tly in Engli&s;h bottoms, on account of their Mediterra|nean pa&s;&s;es. Their whale-fi&s;hery is al&s;o very con|&s;iderable, fifty or &s;ixty &s;hips being generally &s;ent out every year in this trade. Add to the&s;e a va|riety of manufactures, which are performed here with great &s;ucce&s;s, the chief of which are, &s;ugar|baking, calico printing, the weaving of dama&s;ks, brocades, velvets, and other rich &s;ilks. The in|land trade of Hamburg is &s;uperior to that of any in Europe, unle&s;s perhaps we &s;hould except that of Am&s;terdam and London. There is a paper pub|li&s;hed here at &s;tated times, called the Prei&s;courant, &s;pecifying the cour&s;e of exchange, with the price which every commodity and merchandize bore la&s;t upon the exchange. There is al&s;o a board of trade erected on purpo&s;e for the advancing every pro|ject for the improvement of commerce. Another great advantage to the merchants is, the bank e&s;tabli&s;hed in 1619, which has a flouri&s;hing credit. To &s;upply the poor with corn at a low price, here are public granaries, in which great quantities of grain are laid up. By charters from &s;everal empe|rors, the Hamburgers have a right of coinage, which they actually exerci&s;e. The Engli&s;h mer|chants,

or Hamburgh company, as it is called, enjoy great privileges; for they hold a court with particular powers and a juri&s;diction among them&s;elves, and have a church and mini&s;ter of their own. This city has a di&s;trict belonging to it of con&s;iderable extent, which abounds with ex|cellent pa&s;tures, intermixed with &s;everal large villages and noblemen's &s;eats. Of what they po&s;&s;e&s;s in common with the city of Lubeck, mention has been made already. Though Hamburg has an undoubted right to a &s;eat in the diet of the em|pire, yet as &s;he pays no contributions to the mili|tary che&s;t in time of war, and is al&s;o unwilling to draw upon her&s;elf the re&s;entment of Denmark, &s;he makes no u&s;e of that privilege. There is a &s;chola illu&s;tris, or gymna&s;ium here, well endowed, and furni&s;hed with &s;ix able profe&s;&s;ors, who read lec|tures in it as at the univer&s;ities. There are al&s;o &s;everal free-&s;chools, and a great number of libra|ries, public and private. The public cellar of this town has always a prodigious &s;tock and vent of old hock, which brings in a con&s;iderable re|venue to the &s;tate. Be&s;ides the militia, or trained bands, there is an e&s;tabli&s;hment of regular forces, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve companies of infantry, and one troop of dragoons, under the commandant, who is u&s;ually a foreigner, and one who has di&s;|tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in the &s;ervice. There is al&s;o an artillery company and a night-guard, the la&s;t of which is po&s;ted at night all over the city, and calls the hours. The reader, who de&s;ires a more minute account of Hamburg, we refer to a La|tin piece, entitled Curae Geographicae, publi&s;hed not many years ago by Mr. Kle&s;eker, the &s;yndic, in which he will find full &s;atisfaction.

<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of BREMEN.</HEAD>
<P>This city, which gives name to the duchy, and is its capital, &s;tands on the We&s;er, in a fruitful plain, &s;ixty miles &s;outh-we&s;t of-Hamburg; fifty-five ea&s;t of Embden; eighty-three north-we&s;t of Brun&s;wick; eighty-nine we&s;t of Lunenburg; &s;ixty-five we&s;t of Zell; ninety north of Mun&s;ter; and about four hundred and &s;ixty north-we&s;t of Vi|enna. It is a very antient place, and an archiepi&s;co|pal &s;ee, which was founded by Charles the Great. That of Hamburg was incorporated with it in 1223. Bremen has had many privileges con|ferred on it by the emperors, particularly that of a &s;eat and vote in the diet, of fi&s;hing in the We&s;er and other rivers that fall into it, of freedom from arre&s;t throughout the empire, and of coinage. The archbi&s;hops thereof did not embrace the re|formation, till 1585. At the peace of We&s;tphalia the archbi&s;hopric was &s;ecularized, and given to the Swedes, who, by virtue of that ce&s;&s;ion, claimed the &s;overeignty of the city, contrary to the tenth article of the treaty, by which it was declared free and im|perial. The di&s;pute, however, was at length &s;ettled in 1666, when it was obliged to part with &s;ome of its antient privileges. Bremen is governed by a &s;enate, which decides all cau&s;es eccle&s;ia&s;tical, civil, and criminal, without appeal to the imperial cham|ber, unle&s;s the &s;um exceed &s;ix hundred Rheni&s;h guilders, or about two hundred and ten pounds &s;terling. They have their own &s;tatute-laws, and a di&s;trict of about ten miles round, under their ju|ri&s;diction. The We&s;er is not navigable for &s;hips of burden higher than Brake or Elsfleth, near a dozen miles below the city, to which all goods are brought from thence in flat-bottomed ve&s;&s;els. The inhabitants carry on a con&s;iderable trade with
<PB N="310" REF="3150">
England, France, Spain, and Portugal, and have a &s;hare in the whale-fi&s;hery. The inland trade, which is al&s;o con&s;iderable, con&s;i&s;ts in exporting large quantities of beer, refining &s;ugar, printing linens and calicoes, and dre&s;&s;ing leather and cloth to great perfection. In &s;hort, it is reckoned the next port to Hamburg in the whole empire for com|merce. The town is divided into the Old and New by the We&s;er, both which are pretty well fortified with high walls, a broad ditch, and a counter&s;carp, having a garri&s;on of &s;ix hundred men, be&s;ides the guard kept day and night, at the town-hou&s;e, by two hundred of the citizens. On the ramparts is a very agreeable walk, planted with trees, and broad enough for coaches. Here is a grand ar&s;enal well &s;tored with arms and artillery, both antient and modern, and a celebrated academy, or gymna&s;ium, a guildhall, exchange, work-hou&s;e, bridewell, and four capital churches belonging to the Calvi|ni&s;ts, who&s;e religion predominates in this place, though the Lutherans nearly equal them in num|ber. The cathedral belongs to the king of Great Britain as duke of Bremen, and four Lu|theran mini&s;ters officiate in it, of whom the chief is a &s;uperintendant. The epi&s;copal palace, the chapter-hou&s;e, containing about two hundred dwel|lings, an orphan-hou&s;e, a Lutheran gymna&s;ium, and the abbies of St. An&s;charius and St. Wilhad, partly, are al&s;o in the duchy of Bremen, and in|dependent of the city. The papi&s;ts here attend divine wor&s;hip at the chapel belonging to the em|peror's re&s;ident. In 1741 the magi&s;tracy made an intire ce&s;&s;ion to the duchy of the bailiwic of Blu|menthal and Neukerchen juri&s;diction, together with the farms and &s;alt-hou&s;es on the Duvel&s;moor, in lieu of all its claims and preten&s;ions.

It is of great extent, and contains the following &s;tates, viz. the electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, Saxe-Weimar, Saxe-Ei&s;enach, Saxe-Coburg, Saxe Gotha, Saxe-Al|tenburg, Saxe-Querfurt, the Hither and Farther Pomerania, Camin, Anhalt, Quidlenburg, Gern|rode, Walkenried, Schwarzburg, Sonder&s;hau|&s;en, Schwarzburg-Rudol&s;tadt, Mansfeld, Stolberg, Barby, the counts of Reu&s;&s;en, and the counts of Schonberg. No diets have been held in this cir|cle &s;ince the year 1683. The elector of Saxony has always been the &s;ole &s;ummoning prince and director of it. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants profe&s;s the prote&s;tant religion. When the whole empire fur|ni&s;hes forty thou&s;and men, the quota of this circle is one thou&s;and three hundred and twenty-two hor&s;e, and two thou&s;and &s;even hundred and &s;even foot.

<P>This electorate con&s;i&s;ts of the duchy of Saxony, the greate&s;t part of the margravate of Mei&s;&s;en, a part of the Vogtland, and the northern half of the landgravate of Thuringia. The Lu&s;atias al&s;o, and a part of the county of Henneberg, belong to it, but are no part of this circle. The &s;oil of the electoral dominions lying in this circle, is in gene|ral exceeding rich and fruitful, yielding corn, fruits, and pul&s;e in abundance, together with hops, flax, hemp, tobacco, ani&s;eed, wild &s;affron, wood, and in &s;ome places woad, wine, coals, por|celain clay, terra &s;igillata, fullers-earth, fine &s;hi|ver, various &s;orts of beautiful marble, &s;erpentine|&s;tone, and almo&s;t all the different &s;pecies of pre|cious &s;tones. Sulphur al&s;o, allum, vitriol, &s;and, and free-&s;tone, &s;alt-&s;prings, amber, turf, cinna|bar, quick&s;ilver, antimony, bi&s;muth, ar&s;enic, cobalt, and other minerals are found in it. This country, be&s;ides the above articles, contains likewi&s;e valua|ble mines of &s;ilver, copper, tin, lead, and iron, and abounds in many places with horned cattle, &s;heep, hor&s;es and veni&s;on. The principal rivers by which it is watered, are, the Elbe, the Schwarze-El&s;ter, the Mulde, the Saale, the Un&s;trut, the Wei&s;&s;e-El&s;ter, and the Plei&s;&s;e. The&s;e rivers, as well as the lakes and rivulets, abound in fi&s;h, and in the White-El&s;ter are found beautiful pearls. This electorate is extremely well cultivated and inhabited, and is &s;aid to include about two hundred and fifty great and &s;mall towns, upwards of five thou&s;and vil|lages, one hundred and ninety-&s;ix royal manors, and near as many royal ca&s;tles, be&s;ides private e&s;tates and commanderies. The provincial diets here con&s;i&s;t of three cla&s;&s;es. The fir&s;t is compo&s;ed
<PB N="314" REF="3190">
of the prelates, the counts, and lords, and the two univer&s;ities of Leip&s;ic and Wittenberg. To the &s;econd belong the nobility in general, imme|diate or mediate, that is, &s;uch as &s;tand imme|diately under the fief-chancery or the aulic judica|tories, and &s;uch as are immediately under the juri&s;|diction of the amtman. The third cla&s;s is formed of the towns in general. The general provincial diets are ordinarily held every &s;ix years, but there are others, called &s;election diets, which are conve|ned commonly every two years. We would here ob&s;erve, that not only the&s;e diets, but tho&s;e in mo&s;t of the other &s;tates of Germany, are at pre&s;ent ex|tremely in&s;ignificant and unimportant, retaining lit|tle more than the &s;hadow of their former power and privileges; for even the petty princes, tho' they depend upon their more potent neighbours, and mu&s;t be very careful not to give them any umbrage, are almo&s;t as ab&s;olute in their re&s;pective terri|tories, as the grand &s;eignior him&s;elf. As to reli|gion, it was in this country that the reformation took its ri&s;e in the &s;ixteenth century, to which it hath ever &s;ince adhered, according to the doctrines of Luther. The two late electors, when they em|braced popery in order to qualify them&s;elves to be elected kings of Poland, gave the mo&s;t &s;olemn a&s;|&s;urances to their people, that they would invio|lably maintain the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, and its pro|fe&s;&s;ors in the full and free enjoyment of all their eccle&s;ia&s;tical rights, privileges, and prerogatives what&s;oever, in regard to churches, wor&s;hip, cere|monies, u&s;ages, univer&s;ities, &s;chools, benefices, incomes, profits, juri&s;dictions, and immuni|ties. The electoral family &s;till continue Roman catholics, though they have lo&s;t the crown of Po|land, for which they at fir&s;t embraced popery. With re&s;pect to eccle&s;ia&s;tical matters, the coun|try is divided into pari&s;hes, and the&s;e again

Learning flouri&s;hes in this electorate, in which, be&s;ides the free-&s;chools and gymna&s;ia in mo&s;t of the chief towns, are the two celebrated univer&s;ities of Wittenberg and Leipzig, in the la&s;t of which are al&s;o &s;ocieties for the liberal arts and the Ger|man language, with book&s;ellers and printers of the greate&s;t eminence. A great variety of manu|factures are al&s;o carried on in this country. The principal are tho&s;e of fine and coar&s;e linen, thread, fine lace, paper, fine gla&s;&s;es and mirrours, por|celain equal if not &s;uperior to that of China, iron, bra&s;s, and &s;teel wares, manufactures of gold and &s;ilver, cotton, wool, and &s;ilk, gloves, caps, hats, and tape&s;try; in which, and the natural produc|tions mentioned above, together with dying, an important foreign commerce is carried on. A great addition has been made &s;ince the year 1718 to the electoral territories, by the extinction of the collateral branches of Zeitz, Mer&s;eburg, and Wei&s;&s;enfels, who&s;e dominions devolved to the elder electoral branch, de&s;cended from the mar|graves of Mei&s;&s;en.

<HEAD>CIRCLE of THURINGIA.</HEAD>
<P>This circle forms the northern part of the land|gravate, and is a fruitful tract, abounding in corn, e&s;pecially wheat, woods, black cattle, &s;heep, and hor&s;es; and in &s;ome places with vines and woad, and other valuable plants. It contains forty-&s;even towns, fourteen boroughs, betwixt &s;even and eight hundred villages, three hundred noble e&s;tates, &s;even &s;uperintendencies, and five under-con&s;i&s;to|ries. Thuringia, the country of the antient Thu|ringi, or Catti, a branch of the Vandals, men|tioned by Tacitus, was formerly a kingdom, af|terwards a county, then a landgravate, and was governed by its own princes for many ages, till
<PB N="320" REF="3250">
1124, when it devolved to the marquis of Mi&s;nia, and, with that country, afterwards to the duke of Saxony. But the modern Thuringia is only a part of the antient, nay but a part of the antient South Thuringia, which comprehends, be&s;ides, a large &s;hare of the modern Franconia, He&s;&s;e, &amp;c. On the extinction of the male line of the antient landgraves in 1247, it came to the margraves of Mei&s;&s;en, ance&s;tors to the pre&s;ent electoral fa|mily. The elector has no voice in the diet, on ac|count of his &s;hare in the landgravate, or circle of Thuringia, in which the principal places are,</P>

Here is a &s;chola illu&s;tris, or gymna&s;ium, founded out of the di&s;&s;olved nunnery of St. Clere, a Latin &s;chool, and manufactures of &s;ilk and vel|vet.

<HEAD>MARGRAVATE of MEISSEN.</HEAD>
<P>This margravate, or marqui&s;ate, at pre&s;ent, is bounded by Lu&s;atia, Bohemia, Franconia, Thu|ringia, the principality of Anhalt, and the electo|ral circle, or duchy of Saxony. It does not belong entirely to the elector, but partly to the other princes of the hou&s;e of Saxony, the counts of Reu&s;&s;en, and the margraves of Brandenburg-Culmbach. Its plains abound with all &s;orts of grain, its fore&s;ts with veni&s;on, its rivers with fi&s;h, and its hills with minerals. There are large vineyards about Dre&s;den and Mei&s;&s;en; but the wine is not much admired. As the country is

one of the fine&s;t, mo&s;t fruitful, and populous in Germany; &s;o the inhabitants are accounted the mo&s;t polite, ho&s;pitable, and lively of all the Ger|mans. They are al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed by their fine talents and ta&s;te, e&s;pecially in mu&s;ic. The ance&s;|tors of the hou&s;e of Saxony were long margraves of Mei&s;&s;en, before they arrived at the electoral dignity. The marqui&s;ate is u&s;ually divided into five circles. In the fir&s;t, or circle of Mei&s;&s;en, are &s;aid to be forty boroughs, four market-towns, upwards of one thou&s;and villages, two hundred and eighty-three immediate va&s;&s;als, one hundred and eighty mediate ones, and twenty electoral pa|laces, of all which tho&s;e chiefly worth mentioning are</P>
<P>Mei&s;&s;en, which gives name both to the marqui|&s;ate and circle, &s;tands twelve miles north-we&s;t of Dre&s;den, twenty eight &s;outh-ea&s;t of Leipzig, and forty-&s;ix &s;outh of Wittenberg, on the left &s;ide of the Elbe, where the Mei&s;e, a rivulet, from which the town derives its name, falls into it. It was formerly the &s;ee of a bi&s;hopric, which was &s;ecula|rized after the Reformation; but there is &s;till a Lutheran chapter, con&s;i&s;ting of a provo&s;t, dean, a &s;enior, a chanter, and five canons. On a moun|tain here there &s;till remains a part of the old cita|del, in which is carried on the celebrated manu|facture of Mi&s;nian porcelain. Here is a public &s;chool, where was formerly a Benedictine cloy&s;ter, out of the revenues of which, the &s;tudents, in number one hundred and eighteen, are maintain|ed gratis. In the higher part of the town &s;tands the antient cathedral, in which are the tombs of many princes and nobleman. Here are a great many other churches, with a town-&s;chool, and a manufactory of cloth. In 1745 the Pru&s;&s;ians had their head-quarters in this town, and the chief ho&s;pital for their &s;ick. In 1757 they burnt

Be&s;ides the electoral palace, which is an old building erected in the &s;ixteenth century, but repaired, or rather rebuilt, after the great damage it &s;u&s;tained by a fire in 1702, here are a great many other fine palaces, particularly that of the electoral, and the other princes, of count Bruhl, of prince Lubo|mir&s;ki, the hotel de Saxe, de Hoym, &amp;c. In the inner-court of the electoral palace is a collection of rarities, called the Green-vault, that hardly has its equal in Europe. It is divided into &s;even apart|ments, in the fir&s;t of which is a great number of &s;mall bra&s;s models of the mo&s;t famous &s;tatues and monuments extant, both antient and modern; in the &s;econd, is a variety of curious works in ivory; in the third, pure &s;ilver works; in the fourth, gilt &s;ilver plate, and ve&s;&s;els of pure gold; in the fifth, precious &s;tones, and curio&s;ities formed out of them; in the &s;ixth, the arms of the &s;everal Saxon countries, the crown, &s;ceptre, and imperial ap|ple, which were u&s;ed at the coronation in Poland, and other pieces; and in the &s;eventh, &s;ome very rare jewels. In the Zwinger garden is an ine&s;ti|mable repo&s;itory of artificial and natural curio&s;i|ties, together with the electoral library, and an admirable collection of anatomical, chirurgical, phy&s;ical, and mathematical in&s;truments.

The ar&s;enal here was &s;tripped by the Pru&s;&s;ians in 1756. In the town and &s;uburbs are a great many fine churches, ho&s;pitals, and gar|dens. In the &s;uburbs in particular is an electoral palace and garden, with an orangery and kitchen-garden; the iron, copper, &s;ilver, and marble founderies; the boring-mill, and the mill for po|li&s;hing gla&s;s mirrors. In the Japane&s;e palace, which was formerly a &s;eat of count Fleming's, is an immen&s;e quantity of Japan and China ware; and in that called the Turki&s;h palace, are a great variety of fine paintings, repre&s;enting the ceremo|nies of the &s;eraglio, and Turki&s;h dre&s;&s;es, e&s;peci|ally tho&s;e worn by the great officers of &s;tate. The electoral &s;tables al&s;o are well worth &s;eeing, and the opera hou&s;e, and menageries. In this city and its neighbourhood are many curious manufactures, and many ingenious arti&s;ts in &s;tatuary, painting, enamelling, and carving.

This city was formerly called Lepzk, which &s;ignifies a lime tree, the country then abounding with that &s;pecies of trees, and even at pre&s;ent a fine walk of them runs quite round the town; but the ditches are planted with mulberry-trees. Here is a famous univer&s;ity of &s;ix colleges, founded in 1409, in which are twenty|four profe&s;&s;ors. It is not immediately &s;ubject to the elector, but to the town, and has a fine library, containing, among other curious books, Tretzer's Greek Commentary on Homer's Iliads, in a fair character. There are two Latin &s;chools belonging to it, with a German &s;ociety, and another for the encouragement of the liberal arts. A piece is publi&s;hed here monthly, entitled Acta Erudito|rum Lip&s;iae, giving an account of the mo&s;t re|markable performances in the &s;everal branches of literature. This city is the fir&s;t among the towns both at the general and particular diets, and the &s;eat of &s;everal colleges and tribunals, particularly of the upper aulic judicatory. There are many fine churches here, and both the Calvini&s;ts and Papi&s;ts are allowed the public exerci&s;e of their re|ligion. The trade of the city is very great, e&s;pe|cially during the three celebrated fairs at Ea&s;ter, Michaelmas, and the beginning of the new year, when goods and rich curio&s;ities, from all parts of Europe, are brought hither. In 1737 the goods entered at the cu&s;tom hou&s;e were computed to be worth near five millions of dollars. Be&s;ides a va&s;t concour&s;e of merchants and others on the&s;e occa&s;ions, the electoral family, and many other princes and prince&s;&s;es, are often pre&s;ent, and lay out great &s;ums. The ground-floors of mo&s;t of

the hou&s;es in Leip&s;ic are warehou&s;es. A variety of gold and &s;ilver, &s;ilk, woollen, cotton, linen, and tape&s;try manufactures are carried on here. Silk al&s;o is extremely well died, linen and cotton printed, leather dre&s;&s;ed, and Pru&s;&s;ian blue pre|pared. There are about twenty book&s;ellers in the town. Of the gardens in the &s;uburbs, the Appel are the mo&s;t remarkable, taking their name from that of a merchant, who fir&s;t laid them out. The gardeners here are reckoned the be&s;t in Germany. The fields about the city are covered with infi|nite numbers of larks from Michaelmas to Mar|tinmas, and the woods are full of nightingales. The larks are &s;ent to various places in great quan|tities. The city is fortified with ramparts and a ditch, and there is a &s;trong ca&s;tle on the Plei&s;&s;e, called Plei&s;enburg, in which is a mint. The Ger|man language is &s;aid to be &s;poken in great purity in this city, which is very populous, and in winter well lighted with upwards of &s;even hundred lamps. In 1745 and 1756 it was garri&s;oned by the Pru&s;|&s;ians, to whom it was obliged to pay very con|&s;iderable &s;ums of money by way of contribution.

Abundance of cattle, e&s;pecially &s;heep, are bred here; and the woods not only &s;upply the inhabitants with fuel, but with timber, charcoal, tar, and wood-a&s;hes, both for dome&s;tic u&s;es, and for exportation. The culture of &s;ilk is al&s;o carried on in this country with great &s;ucce&s;s. The prin|cipal rivers by which it is watered are the Elbe, the Oder, the Prignitz, the Havel, the Warte, and the Spree. Some of the rivers and lakes abound in fi&s;h, and are united by canals, for the benefit of navigation. They reckon in the whole Mark one hundred and twenty towns, above two thou|&s;and
<PB N="345" REF="3500">
five hundred villages, and about eight hun|dred thou&s;and inhabitants. The &s;tates here con|&s;i&s;t of the nobility and towns, who&s;e a&s;&s;embly|hou&s;e is in the Spandau-&s;treet at Berlin, and who &s;till enjoy &s;ome &s;mall remains of their antient pri|vileges. The hereditary officers of the marqui&s;ate are a mar&s;hal, chamberlain, cup bearer, pur|veyor, &s;ewer, trea&s;urer, and ranger. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who is al&s;o elector of Brandenburg, with his whole court, are Calvini&s;ts; but the re|ligion of mo&s;t of the inhabitants is Lutherani&s;m. The churches of both per&s;ua&s;ions are well endowed, and the laity jointly employed by the government. The Roman catholics are al&s;o tolerated here. In &s;hort, every inhabitant enjoys full liberty of con&s;cience. A great variety of manufactures, mo&s;t of which were introduced by the French refugees, are car|ried on in the marqui&s;ate, e&s;pecially at Berlin and Pot&s;dam, where are al&s;o excellent painters, &s;tatu|aries, and engravers. By means of the&s;e manu|factures, fabrics, and arts, not only large &s;ums are kept in the country, but al&s;o imported from other parts, to which con&s;iderable quantities of the manufactures, and natural productions, are exported. For the education of youth, and the advancement of learning, be&s;ides Latin &s;chools in &s;everal places, and gymna&s;ia, there is an univer|&s;ity at Frankfort on the Oder, and an academy of &s;ciences at Berlin. This marqui&s;ate, together with the arch-chamberlain's-office, and the electoral dig|nity, was conferred, in 1415, hereditarily on Fre|deric V. or VI. burgrave of Nuremberg, in who&s;e family it &s;till remains, with the addition of many other territories and dignities. The pre&s;ent king of Pru&s;&s;ia and elector of Brandenburg Frederic III. is one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t powerful princes of Europe, as well as one of the mo&s;t de&s;potic. He hath greatly en|larged his dominions, by the addition of all the
<PB N="346" REF="3510">
Lower, together with the greate&s;t part of the Upper Sile&s;ia, and the county of Glatz. In 1744 he al&s;o took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Ea&s;t Frie&s;land; but in 1754 di&s;po&s;ed of his &s;hare of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the late king William, prince of Orange, to the pre|&s;ent prince and &s;tadtholder. The qualifications and talents of this prince are great, and he hath performed many &s;ingular actions; but his ambi|tion would have proved his ruin, had he not been &s;upported in the la&s;t war by the troops and trea&s;ures of Great Britain. It is hard to &s;ay, whether his &s;ub|jects have been greater gainers by his encouraging and promoting commerce, manufactures, agri|culture, population, order, and the regular di&s;tri|bution of ju&s;tice; or &s;ufferers by the wars in which his ambition hath involved them, and the prodi|gious &s;tanding army he keeps con&s;tantly on foot, to maintain his conque&s;ts, and extend them, as opportunity offers. Such an army mu&s;t be a great burden, be&s;ides their labour being lo&s;t in a great mea&s;ure to the country. His title runs thus, Fre|deric, king of Pru&s;&s;ia, margrave of Brandenburg; of the holy Roman empire arch-chamberlain and elector; &s;overeign and &s;upreme duke of Sile&s;ia; &s;overeign prince of Orange, Neufchatel and Va|lengin; of the county of Glatz, Gelders, Magde|burg, Cleve, Juliers, Berg, Stetin, Pomera|nia, the Ca&s;&s;ubi and Wends, Mecklenburg and Cro&s;&s;en, duke; burgrave of Nuremberg; prince of Halber&s;tadt, Minden, Camin, Wenden, Schwe|rin, Ratzeburg, Ea&s;t-Frie&s;eland, and Meurs; count of Hohenzollern, Ruppin, the Mark, Raven&s;berg, Hohen&s;tein, Tecklenburg, Schwerin, Lingen, Buren, and Leerdam; lord of Raven&s;tein, the countries of Ro&s;tock, Stargard, Lauenburg, Butow, Arlay, and Breda, &amp;c. Among the electors he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es the &s;eventh place. As arch|chamberlan he carries the &s;cepter before the em|peror
<PB N="347" REF="3520">
at his coronation, and brings him water in a &s;ilver ba&s;on to wa&s;h with. In the college of princes of the empire, he has five voices. His a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, as elector, is &s;ixty hor&s;e and two hun|dred and &s;eventy-&s;even foot, or one thou&s;and eight hundred and twenty-eight florins in lieu of them. To the chamber of Wetzlar his quota is eight hundred and eleven rix-dollars, fifty-eight kruitzers, each term. As to the orders of the knights of the Black Eagle, and of Merit, it is &s;ufficient here to ob&s;erve, that the former was in|&s;tituted by king Frederic I. at his coronation, and the other by the pre&s;ent king. For the go|vernment of this country and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, there are &s;everal &s;upreme colleges and tribunals, particularly for the departments of war, foreign affairs, and the finances, there are di&s;tinct boards. Here is al&s;o a &s;upreme eccle&s;ia&s;tical council and con&s;i&s;tory for the Lutherans; a &s;upreme directory of the Calvini&s;t church; a &s;upreme medicinal college; a &s;upreme mine-office; a college or board of trade, &amp;c. Tho&s;e of the French nation, &s;ettled in this country, are al|lowed particular courts of their own. The a|mount of the yearly revenues of the Mark, a|ri&s;ing from the domains, protection-money paid by the Jews, tolls, land-tax, mines, fore&s;ts, du|ties on &s;tamp-paper, &s;alt, and variety of other im|po&s;ts and exci&s;es, is computed at about two mil|lions and a half of crowns; but the money is &s;aid to be much inferior in goodne&s;s to that of Saxo|ny and the dominions of Hanover. During the late war it was extremely deba&s;ed. Some e&s;ti|mate the whole number of the inhabitants of the royal and electoral dominions at five millions, and the revenues at about two millions &s;terling. The pre&s;ent king and elector keeps upwards of one hundred thou&s;and men on foot in time of peace,

which are &s;aid to co&s;t him more than half of his whole revenue. The&s;e troops are under &s;trict di&s;cipline, very expert at their exerci&s;e, always in readine&s;s to march, and always com|plete. Each regiment has a particular canton or di&s;trict allotted it, for its quarters and rai&s;ing re|cruits. The infantry are cloathed in blue, and the hor&s;e and dragoons in white; and both are re|quired to hear &s;ermon twice a day when in quar|ters or garri&s;ons. In time of peace they are al|lowed, for &s;everal months in the year, to hire them&s;elves out, or to follow their bu&s;ine&s;s either as burghers or pea&s;ants, in the canton where they are quartered; but they are not allowed to marry. A con&s;iderable part of the&s;e troops are &s;tationed in the Mark, particularly at Berlin and Pot&s;dam. The corps of hu&s;&s;ars alone amounts to about ten thou&s;and men. The Mark of Brandenburg is divided, in general, into the Electoral and New Marks. The former is again &s;ubdivided into the Old Mark, the Pregnitz, the Middle Mark, and the Ucker Mark. In the Old Mark, which lies on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Elbe, between that river and Lunenburg, and is about fifty miles in length, and thirty in breadth. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable places are</P>
<P>Stendal, the metropolis, &s;tanding on the river Uchte, twenty-eight miles north of Magdeburg, in a plain, near a large fore&s;t &s;urrounded by mountains. It was formerly one of the Han&s;e|towns, and had &s;everal cloi&s;ters, the revenues of which are now applied partly to the maintenance of the univer&s;ity of Franckfort on the Oder, the town &s;chool, and the convents of Lutheran ladies. The town is &s;trongly fortified, has divers manufac|tures, introduced by the French refugees, who enjoy a tribunal here of their own, and is the &s;eat of the &s;upreme tribunal of the Old Mark, of a general

<P>Salzwedel, a town &s;eated on the Jeeze, in a low marchy tract, and divided into the old and new, each of which has its own magi&s;tracy. Here were antiently &s;everal cloi&s;ters, the churches of which are &s;till in good condition. There are now &s;ome woollen and linen manufactures, in which and beer, a bri&s;k trade is carried on. The town was formerly of the Han&s;e, and at pre&s;ent gives name to a circle and provincial riding. In its neigh|bourhood is found &s;alt-petre.</P>
<P>Gardenlegen, or Gardeleben, a town on the Mulde, having a manufacture of cloth, a Latin|&s;chool, &s;everal churches and ho&s;pitals, and giv|ing name to a circle, and provincial riding. In 1757 the French exacted heavy contributions from it. In the neighbourhood is a large wood called the heath of Gardelegen, and al&s;o hop-gardens.</P>
<P>Seehau&s;en, a &s;mall town &s;urrounded by the ri|ver Aland, giving name to a circle and provincial riding.</P>
<P>Tangermunde, a town on the river Tanger, near its influx into the Elbe, where all &s;hips going up or down the la&s;t of the&s;e rivers, pay a toll. The town gives name to a circle and riding, and has a &s;trong fort near it, with &s;ome trade by means of the Elbe.</P>

<P>Havelberg, a &s;mall town on an i&s;land in the ri|ver Havel, over which there are three draw|bridges. It was antiently the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;uffragan to Magdeburg, and has &s;till a Luthe|ran chapter, the members of which are di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by a cro&s;s, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of a con&s;idera|ble e&s;tate. Great quantities of brandy are di|&s;tilled, and &s;tockings knit here, where is al&s;o a con&s;iderable fi&s;hery in the Elbe. Abundance of wood al&s;o is conveyed from hence to Hamburg.</P>
<P>Lenzen, a &s;mall town &s;ituated not far from the Elbe, near two lakes, and giving name to a circle and in&s;pection. Here is al&s;o a toll and ferry on the Elbe.</P>
<P>Wit&s;tack, a &s;mall town &s;ituated on the Do&s;&s;e, where was formerly a palace of the bi&s;hop of Havelberg. The town gives name to a circle and &s;piritual in&s;pection, in the former of which, near Zechlin, is a chry&s;tal and gla&s;s-hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Wel&s;nack, a &s;mall town on the Kartau. Pil|grimages were made to this place antiently, on account of its three ho&s;ts, which the prie&s;ts and monks from lucrative views, pretended remained untouched when the church was burnt down, with a drop of blood on each of them. In con|&s;equence of the re&s;ort of devotees, this place ro&s;e from a village to a town.</P>
<P>The third divi&s;ion of the electoral Mark is that called the Middle Mark, which is bounded by the Pregnitz, the duchy of Magdeburg, the duchy of Saxony, the Lower Lu&s;atia, the Neumark, the
<PB N="352" REF="3590">
Uckermark, and the duchy of Mecklenburg. It is &s;aid to extend about one hundred miles from the banks of the Elbe to the Oder, and is divided into eight circles, in which the principal places are</P>
<P>Berlin, the capital of the whole Pru&s;&s;ian domi|nions, and one of the fine&s;t and large&s;t cities of Germany. It con&s;i&s;ts of five towns united toge|ther, and is the u&s;ual re&s;idence of the royal family, and the &s;eat of the high colleges. In 1755, the number of inhabitants, including the garri&s;on, with their wives and children, amounted to one hundred and twenty-&s;ix thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-one. It lies on the Spree, and contains many fine palaces, and other buildings, many long, &s;trait, and broad &s;treets, and &s;ome fine &s;quares. Among the mo&s;t remarkable public and other edifices in it is, the royal palace, which is a va&s;t pile of buildings, but not regular or uniform, having been built by different architects, and at different times. It is adorned with the fine&s;t paintings and tape&s;try, and &s;uch a quantity of gold and &s;ilver plate, e&s;pecially the latter, as is not to be met with in any other court in Europe. Here is al&s;o a cabinet of rarities, natural and artificial, a choice collection of medals, with a di&s;pen&s;ary for the palace, and one of the be&s;t libraries in the empire. Of the other &s;tructures the chief are, the council-hou&s;e in King's-&s;treet; the Calvini&s;t gymna&s;ium in the St. E&s;prit-&s;treet, well endow|ed; the magnificent garri&s;on church, and provin|cial-hou&s;e in Spandau-&s;treet; the Jews &s;ynagogue in Heydereuter-&s;treet; the royal magazine in Cloy&s;ter-&s;treet, in which is kept a great quantity of rough wool, which is delivered out to poor manufacturers to be &s;pun and wove, and when returned is dyed and di&s;po&s;ed of by the managers of the orphan hou&s;e at Pot&s;dam, to which cha|rity the profits of it are appropriated; the Luthe|ran

gymna&s;ium in that called the Gray-cloi&s;ter; Frederic's fine ho&s;pital in Stralau-&s;treet, in which above eight hundred children are in&s;tructed gratis. At the King's gate is the court of the cadets, in which young noblemen and gentlemen are in&s;truct|ed in all noble exerci&s;es, and particularly are fit|ted for commands in the army, and in the corps of engineers. All the&s;e, except the royal palace, which &s;tands in that part of the city called Old Coln, are in the Proper Berlin. In the &s;uburbs is the magnificent garden of count Reu&s;&s;en, that beautiful hou&s;e and garden called Monbijou, the hou&s;e and garden of Belvidere, &amp;c. the large and &s;tately ho&s;pital for invalids, in which about one thou&s;and per&s;ons are maintained, con&s;i&s;ting of officers and &s;oldiers, with their wives and children. Be&s;ides lodging and fuel, they have a certain al|lowance of bread and money weekly. Over the Spree are &s;everal bridges, one of which, con&s;i&s;ting of five arches, is very beautiful, and has a metal &s;tatue on it of the great elector Frederic-William. In the magnificent new Calvini&s;t church in Old Coln, is the burying-place of the royal family. In the &s;ame quarter is al&s;o the new riding-acade|my, the royal &s;tables, a Lutheran gymna&s;ium, and many other &s;tately edifices, public and private. There are two &s;ugar-hou&s;es in this city, in which as much &s;ugar is refined as is &s;ufficient to &s;up|ply the whole Pru&s;&s;ian dominions. Many other manufactures are carried on here, particularly one of porcelain, inferior in no re&s;pect to that of Mei&s;&s;en, except in the paintings. The improvement of Ber|lin, and of the Pru&s;&s;ian dominions in general, has been owing in a great mea&s;ure to the French re|fugees, and the arts and manufactures introduced by them. The canals cut from it to the Havel, the Oder, and the Elbe, not only &s;upply it with plen|ty of fi&s;h, but greatly promote its trade; as they
<PB N="354" REF="3620">
open a communication, by &s;mall ve&s;&s;els, from Si|le&s;ia to the mouth of the Elbe: add to this, the great attention of the king to the embelli&s;hment and aggrandizement of his capital, and its flouri&s;h|ing condition will no longer be matter of wonder. Here is an academy of &s;ciences, an academy of fine arts, e&s;pecially painting, a college for phy|&s;ic and &s;urgery, an anatomical theatre, a fine tape&s;try manufacture, a grand opera hou&s;e, an ar&s;enal, a number of well regulated ho&s;pitals, many Lutheran and Calvini&s;t, with two Roman Catho|lic churches, many plea&s;ant gardens and walks, and, to crown the whole, an admirable police and order in every particular. We may form &s;ome idea of the trade and indu&s;try of this city by the number of looms at work in it, which in 1755 were for &s;ilks four hundred and forty-three, for half &s;ilks one hundred and forty-nine, for woollen &s;tuffs two thou&s;and eight hundred and fifty-eight, for cotton four hundred and fifty-four, for linen two hundred and forty-eight, for lace-work four hun|dred and fifty-four, for &s;ilk &s;tockings thirty-nine, and for woollen cloths three hundred and ten. In 1757 a &s;traggling party of Au&s;trians made an irruption into the &s;uburbs of Kopenick, and ex|torted from the inhabitants two hundred thou|&s;and rix-dollars. The environs of Berlin are very plea&s;ant, being inter&s;per&s;ed with villages, vineyards, canals, plea&s;ure-hou&s;es, and gardens belonging to the royal family, or individuals. Among the palaces in the neighbourhood be|longing to the royal family, Schonhau&s;en and Charlottenburg are the mo&s;t remarkable. The fir&s;t is about two miles from Berlin, on the river Panka, which &s;upplies its fine gardens with water. The other, which is richly furni&s;hed, and &s;tands on the Spree, hath a garden laid out in a very fine ta&s;te, and contains the curious collection of an|tiques
<PB N="355" REF="3630">
once belonging to cardinal Polignac. The longitude of the city is 13 deg. 44 min. ea&s;t, and the latitude fifty-two deg. twenty-eight min. &s;tand|ing &s;ixty miles north-ea&s;t of Magdeburg, one hun|dred and fifty north-we&s;t of Prague, and three hundred north-we&s;t of Vienna.</P>
<P>Brandenburg lies upon the Havel, twenty-three miles from Berlin, and gives name to the whole electorate. It is divided into the Old and New Town, and was antiently the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop. The mountain in the neighbourhood, called Marien|berg, is planted with vines. Here is a &s;mall co|lony of French Calvini&s;ts, with a manufacture of cloth, fu&s;tian, and canvas; and a pretty good trade is carried on by means of the Havel. The fort here looks like a &s;uburb, and contains a riding|&s;chool, with the cathedral church. The greate&s;t part al&s;o of the members of the chapter, which &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, and is compo&s;ed of a Lutheran provo&s;t, dean, &s;enior, &s;ub&s;enior, and three other canons, re&s;ides in it. They are di&s;tingui&s;hed by a cro&s;s of gold, enamelled with violet, terminating in eight points, and have a con&s;iderable e&s;tate. Near the town is a large lake.</P>
<P>Pot&s;dam, a large town on an i&s;land formed by the Havel, and &s;ome neighbouring lakes, four miles &s;outh-we&s;t of Berlin. It was but an incon&s;idera|ble place, till the elector Frederic-William built a palace or ca&s;tle in it, &s;ince which the town hath been continually increa&s;ing, and receiving new embelli&s;hments, as well as the palace. Many &s;trait &s;treets, with canals in the middle, and rows of trees on each &s;ide, as in Holland, run thro' the centre of the town from the Havel, and make a grand appearance. The palace it&s;elf, and the hou&s;es in the neighbourhood of it, are very magnificent. Before the ca&s;tle is a &s;quare, adorned with Roman columns, in which the gar|ri&s;on
<PB N="356" REF="3640">
is daily exerci&s;ed; and behind are very fine gardens. In the neighbourhood is a large fore&s;t or park, paled in for &s;tag-hunting, containing a royal hunting-&s;eat, with vi&s;tas in form of a &s;tar. About the town are al&s;o many vineyards, and in the market-place is a &s;tately obeli&s;k, of variegated Sile&s;ian marble, with a pede&s;tal of white marble, and marble bu&s;ts of the kings on each &s;ide. In the orphan-hou&s;e two thou&s;and &s;oldiers children of both &s;exes are maintained, cloathed, and edu|cated. Here are &s;everal beautiful churches, in one of which is a fine &s;et of chimes, a noble foun|dery for arms, manufactures of velvet, &s;ilk, gold and &s;ilver lace, &amp;c. and fine &s;tables for the hor&s;e|guards, of which, with the foot guards, and other battalions, the garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts. Not far from this town is the palace of Sans-Souci, on the top of a mountain, whence there is a mo&s;t delightful pro&s;pect of the town, and the adjacent country, with its woods, groves, lakes, vineyards, and rivers. The palace is but &s;mall, but extremely elegant, richly furni&s;hed, and adorned with the fine&s;t paintings, &s;culptures, &s;tatues, gardens, and whatever el&s;e can contribute to render it a mo&s;t enchanting place.

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of GOTHA.</HEAD>
<P>This principality, excepting two bailiwics, which are detached from the re&s;t, is &s;urrounded by the principality of Ei&s;enach, the county of Hen|neberg, the principality of Weimar, the territory of Erfurt, and the Saxon bailiwic of Langen&s;alza. The country is well watered by the Leine, the Ne&s;&s;e, the Apfel&s;&s;tatt, and the Gera; abounds in grain and fruit; and in that part of it which lies in the fore&s;t of Thuringia, are mine works. It contains &s;even cities, five towns, and has its &s;tates and diets, con&s;i&s;ting of the nobility and certain towns. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion is Lutherani&s;m; and the government of the church, as in other places of that per&s;ua&s;ion, is by con&s;i&s;tories, with general and &s;pecial &s;uperintendents. This duke is the mo&s;t powerful of all the princes of the Er|ne&s;tine line. He has the officers of &s;tate, and the courts and colleges common to &s;overeign princes. His court is magnificent, his revenue being com|puted at a million of crowns, or two hundred thou|&s;and pounds &s;terling; his guards, con&s;i&s;ting of one hundred and &s;ixty &s;oldiers, are well cloathed,

Here is a con&s;iderable trade in woollen manufactures, woad, and beer: be&s;ides, the town is a great tho|roughfare, and the re&s;idence of the court. The ducal palace, or ca&s;tle, which is well fortified, and called Freden&s;tein, &s;tands on a hill near the town, whence there is an exten&s;ive pro&s;pect over a fertile plain. It contains a valuable library, with a curious collection of rarities, and medals, a fine chapel, a mint, an armoury, a play-hou&s;e, and laboratory, and is embelli&s;hed with fine gardens; as is al&s;o Frederick&s;thal, another ducal palace in the &s;uburbs.

This principality, except the di&s;trict of Burg, reverted upon the failure of the Saxe-Wei&s;&s;enfels collate|ral line to the electoral hou&s;e, which, on account of it, has a &s;eat and voice in the diet, paying to the chamber of Wetzlar, forty-two rix-dollars, &s;even kruitzers.

<P>Querfurt, which gives name to the principality, and is its capital, being a con&s;iderable town, in|cluding the &s;uburbs, with an old ca&s;tle on a hill. It is the &s;eat of a &s;uperintendency, and, with its dependencies, antiently con&s;tituted a lord&s;hip. A fair is held annually on the Wedne&s;day in Ea&s;ter week, a little without the town, and much re|&s;orted to.</P>
<P>Heldrungen, a &s;mall town, not far from the Un&s;trut, giving name to a di&s;trict and &s;uperin|tendency. It had formerly a &s;trong ca&s;tle, and lords of its own.</P>
<P>Juterbock, a town &s;ituated on the Angerbach, which had formerly a ca&s;tle, and now gives name to a di&s;trict and &s;uperintendency. Near it, in 1644, a battle was fought between the imperia|li&s;ts and Swedes, to the advantage of the latter.</P>

<HEAD>DUCHY of POMERANIA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded on the ea&s;t by a part of Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, to the &s;outh by Poland and the
<PB N="379" REF="3870">
marqui&s;ate of Brandenburg, by the duchy of Mecklenburg to the we&s;t, and the Baltic &s;ea to the north. Taking all together, though much le&s;s than it was antiently, it extends above two hundred miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, along the coa&s;t of the Baltic, and from fifty to eighty in breadth. As to the &s;oil, it is, in general, pretty fruitful, yielding wheat, rye, barley, oats, buck-wheat, turneps, pea&s;e, beans, and vetches, and in &s;ome parts, millet, flax, and hemp. The woods and fo|re&s;ts &s;upply the inhabitants with timber and fuel, game, and veni&s;on; the rivers, lakes, and &s;ea, with fi&s;h, and a great variety of water-fowl, and the heaths with turf; nor is it de&s;titute of fruit, mine|ral and &s;alt-&s;prings, and herds of cattle. The Pomeranian gee&s;e, hams, &s;au&s;ages, and &s;almon, are reckoned the be&s;t in Germany. The princi|pal rivers here are the Oder, the Reckenitz, the Peene, the Ucker, the Rando, the Ihna, the Re|ga, the Per&s;ante, the Wipper, the Grabo, the Stolpe, the Lupo, and the Lebe, all which fall into the Baltic, within the limits of this duchy. There are &s;everal pretty good havens upon the coa&s;t, on which al&s;o, e&s;pecially that of Hither Pomerania, amber is frequently found. In the whole duchy are &s;ixty-eight towns, which are di|vided into immediate and mediate. The latter are &s;ubject to their lords, who are either the king's agents, or noblemen, and their courts; but the for|mer are independent of the&s;e, and have &s;pecial privileges, particularly that of being repre&s;ented in the diets, which con&s;i&s;t of the prelates, nobi|lity, and deputies of the&s;e towns. The inhabi|tants of the duchy, who are computed at four hundred and &s;ixty thou&s;and, are mo&s;tly de&s;cended from the Germans and Sclavonians, or Wends. The language of the latter is &s;till &s;poken in &s;ome parts of the country. The pea&s;ants, on the e&s;tates
<PB N="380" REF="3880">
of the nobility, are, in general, bound to &s;occage; but tho&s;e belonging to the towns, and &s;ome of the others, live more happily, and are exempt from &s;ervile duties. Lutherani&s;m is the predominant religion here; but Calvini&s;ts and catholics are al&s;o tolerated, at lea&s;t in &s;ome places. Be&s;ides the grammar-&s;chools and colleges to be met with here, there is an univer&s;ity at Grieffswalde. In the towns on the navigable rivers and the Baltic, a con&s;ide|rable trade is carried on, and many manufactures e&s;tabli&s;hed. From the port of Stetin, in 1756, no le&s;s than one thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and &s;eventy|one ve&s;&s;els were laden, be&s;ides ninety-&s;even that went away in balla&s;t. The antient inhabitants of the country were the Suevi and the Vandals, to whom, in the &s;ixth century, &s;ucceeded the Sclavo|nians or Wends, and afterwards, under the dukes, great numbers of Germans removed hither, chiefly from the Brun&s;wic territories. The race of the&s;e dukes began about the beginning of the twelfth century, and came to a period in 1637; after which, at the treaty of We&s;tphalia, a great part of the country was a&s;&s;igned to Sweden, and the re&s;t to the elector of Brandenburg; but by the peace of Stockholm in 1720, Frederic-William, king of Pru&s;&s;ia, obtained a con&s;iderable portion of that which had been ceded to the Swedes. On account of this duchy both Sweden and Pru&s;&s;ia have a vote in the diets of the empire and circle; the former paying one hundred and twenty-three rix-dollars, twelve kruitzers; and the latter two hundred and &s;eventy rix-dollars, forty-nine kruit|zers, to the chamber of Wetzlar. The Swedi&s;h governor re&s;ides at Stral&s;und, which together with Grieffswalde and Wi&s;mar, is the &s;eat of the high colleges and tribunals; but tho&s;e of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia are held at Old Stetin, or Co&s;zlin. The
<PB N="381" REF="3890">
revenues ari&s;ing to Sweden from Pomerania amount to about one hundred and twenty-four thou&s;and rix-dollars; whereas the king of Pru&s;|&s;ia's &s;hare brings him in near eight hundred thou|&s;and. The u&s;ual divi&s;ion of the duchy is into the Anterior and Hinder Pomerania, which are &s;eparated by the Oder.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ANTERIOR POMERANIA.</HEAD>
<P>Anterior Pomerania belongs partly to Sweden and partly to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia. The Swedi&s;h part comprehends &s;everal i&s;lands, of which Rugen is the chief, and a part of the continent. The i&s;le of Rugen, which had its name from its an|tient inhabitants the Rugii, is about thirty|miles in length, and near the &s;ame extent in breadth, but much indented. It is very fruitful in corn and gra&s;s, breeds abundance of cattle, and is well &s;upplied with fi&s;h; but has mo&s;t of its fuel from the continent. On the penin&s;ula of Ta&s;mund is a lake, called the Black lake, from its fi&s;h, which are all black on the out&s;ide, but their fle&s;h is white and very palatable. Rugen gives name to a principality comprehending mo&s;t of the Swe|di&s;h Pomerania. Bargen and Garz are the only towns in it worth mentioning. The former, a &s;mall open town, lies fourteen miles north-we&s;t of Stral&s;und, in the centre of the i&s;land, contains a Lutheran convent for young ladies, and is the &s;eat of the provincial court of ju&s;tice, and like|wi&s;e of a governor and &s;uperintendent. Here al&s;o the nobles hold their a&s;&s;emblies. Garz is a &s;mall town in the bailiwic of Bergen, which had an|tiently a very &s;trong fort or ca&s;tle. The le&s;&s;er i&s;lands lying about Rugen contain nothing re|markable except that of Hidden&s;ee, on which is a light-hou&s;e. The principal places on the conti|nent
<PB N="382" REF="3900">
of Anterior Pomerania belonging to Sweden, are</P>
<P>Stral&s;und, the capital of the Swedi&s;h Pomera|nia, &s;tanding on the &s;trait that divides the i&s;le of Rugen from the continent, thirty-two miles north-ea&s;t of Ro&s;tock, and &s;ixty-&s;ix north-we&s;t of Stetin. It was formerly one of the principal Han&s;e-towns, and took its name from the Strait or Sunde, which lies between it and the little i&s;land of Danholm, antiently called Strela, and which was thence called Strel, or Stral&s;und. Here are many con&s;i|derable merchants. Here al&s;o the &s;tates of Swe|di&s;h Pomerania a&s;&s;emble, the governor-general re&s;ides, and the chief courts and offices are kept. The town is very &s;trong both by nature and art, its trade very con&s;iderable, and its privileges and immunities great. It is &s;o &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, and by lakes and mar&s;hes, that it is acce&s;&s;ible only by bridges and cau&s;eways. Here is an excellent haven, by which &s;hips come into the heart of the town, and from whence a great deal of corn and naval &s;tores are exported. The town has been frequently be&s;ieged, particularly in 1678, by the elector of Brandenburg, when it was &s;o furiou&s;ly bombarded, that it &s;urrendered the third day, when about eighteen hundred hou&s;es had been de|&s;troyed.</P>
<P>Barth, a town &s;ituated on a &s;mall bay ten miles we&s;t of Stral&s;und, and &s;eventy-three north ea&s;t of Stetin. It gives name to a principality, con|&s;i&s;ting of that part of the principality of Rugen which lies upon the continent, and has a harbour, but it is too &s;hallow. A &s;ort of beer is brewed in this place which is much valued; and in its neigh|bourhood, at the village of Kenz, is a mineral water greatly frequented. It contains al&s;o a &s;trong ca&s;tle, and a &s;eminary for ladies, founded in 1733.
<PB N="383" REF="3910">
The adjacent fields are very fruitful in all &s;orts of corn.</P>
<P>Damgard, an open town with a ca&s;tle, not far from the Rekenitz.</P>
<P>Trib&s;ees, a &s;mall town which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of ANHALT.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is bounded by Mi&s;nia on the &s;outh; by the duchy of Magdeburg, and the prin|cipality of Halber&s;tadt on the north and north-we&s;t; by the duchy of Saxony on the ea&s;t, and Thuringia on the we&s;t. It is about &s;ixty miles in length, and from twelve to eighteen in breadth. As the country is partly hilly, and partly cham|paign, the air and &s;oil differ con&s;iderably. On the hills the air is &s;harp and healthy, but in the levels, tho' the air is not &s;o good, the &s;oil is much better. In one or the other, however, the land yields wheat, barley, rye, hops, wine, tobacco, hay, fruit, and fine woods of oak, beech, poplar, elm, and limes. The rivers are the Elbe, the Mulde, the Wipper, the Saale, the Seike, the
<PB N="392" REF="4000">
Bude, the Fuhne, the Zitau, the Nuhte, and the Ro$zlau, which abound with fi&s;h, and the Mulde, in particular, yields &s;almon. On the Harz are mines of lead, copper, &s;ilver, and iron, together with &s;ulphur, vitriol, alum, &s;alt petre, coals, and other minerals. The whole principality has nine|teen towns and two boroughs in it. The &s;tates, con&s;i&s;ting of the nobility and the towns, are &s;um|moned to the diets in the name of the four princes of the hou&s;e of Anhalt, and generally meet where the elde&s;t branch of the family re&s;ides. Chri&s;tia|nity was introduced here in the ninth century, and the reformation in the year 1521. The prince of Zerb&s;t, with the greate&s;t part of his &s;ubjects, are Lutherans; but Calvini&s;m is the e&s;tabli&s;hed reli|gion in the territories of the other princes. The univer&s;ity at Zerb&s;t belongs in common to the &s;everal branches of the hou&s;e of Anhalt. The principality derives its name from the ca&s;tle of Anhalt, the ruins of which are &s;till to be &s;een not far from Harzgerode. Joachim Erne&s;t II. who died in 1560, leaving &s;even &s;ons be|hind him, was the founder of all the pre&s;ent princes of Anhalt. Two of his &s;ons dying with|out heirs, and one living retired from the world, the other four divided their father's territories a|mong them. The u&s;ual title at pre&s;ent of the four branches, viz. tho&s;e of De&s;&s;au, Bernburg, Co|then, and Zerb&s;t, is, Princes of Anhalt, dukes of Saxony, Engern, and We&s;tphalia, counts of A&s;|cania, lords of Bernberg and Zerb&s;t. They have all but one vote in the diets of the empire and circle, which is delivered by the elde&s;t branch, by whom al&s;o all matters of general concern are managed and directed: at the &s;ame time, each of the reigning branches has its particular courts and colleges. Their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the army of the em|pire, is nine hor&s;e and twenty foot, or one hun|dred and eighty florins monthly, in lieu of them;
<PB N="393" REF="4010">
and to the chamber of Wetzlar, two hundred and forty-three &s;ix-dollars, forty-&s;even kruitzers.

<HEAD>The ABBEY of QUEDLINBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This free imperial abbey, at the Reformation, embraced Lutherani&s;m, and was &s;ecularized. It con&s;i&s;ts at pre&s;ent of four dignitaries, viz. of the lady abbe&s;s, and three others, di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of provo&s;t, dean, and canon. The abbe&s;s is a prince&s;s of the empire, and has a &s;eat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle. The electors of Saxony were formerly patrons, or pro|tectors of the abbey; but afterwards transferred their rights to the hou&s;e of Brandenburg for three hundred thou&s;and rix-dollars. No abbe&s;s, or other dignitary, is to be cho&s;en without the know|ledge and con&s;ent of the protector, who appoints certain officers to &s;uperintend the rights and privi|leges both of the patron and abbey, together with a court of ju&s;tice, and tax-office. All the digni|taries mu&s;t be at lea&s;t barone&s;&s;es, and prove their noble extraction for eight de&s;cents. They make no vows, and are under no re&s;traints, both re|ceiving and returning vi&s;its. They may even quit the abbey, if they have an inclination, and marry: and &s;ince the Reformation, &s;ome of the abbe&s;&s;es have been widows. Several princes hold fiefs of the abbey, the revenue of which, however, does not exceed five thou&s;and pounds &s;terling per annum. In the territory belonging to it, which lies in the principality of Halber&s;tadt, the only places worth mentioning are,</P>
<P><PB N="398" REF="4060">
Quedlinburg on the Bode, where the abbey is &s;ituate, and whence it takes its name. Here is a court of ju&s;tice belonging to the abbey; the higher juri&s;diction being the prerogative of the protector, and the lower of the abbe&s;s, who with her chapter live on a hill, near the town, at the cathedral of St. Servatius, in which Henry I. &s;urnamed the Fowler, who founded the abbey, lies interred. There were formerly &s;everal convents in and near the town, as there are now &s;everal churches and ho&s;pitals, with a college, which was formerly a Franci&s;can cloi&s;ter. In 937 the emperor Otho I. conferred the town and imperial palace on the abbey; but the former having afterwards put it|&s;elf under the protection of the bi&s;hop of Halber|&s;tadt, and acceded to the Hans confederacy, was reduced again, in 1477, under the dominion of the abbe&s;s Hedwiga, by her brother the elector Erne&s;t, and duke Albert of Saxony.</P>

<HEAD>The ABBEY of WALKENRIED.</HEAD>
<P>This free imperial abbey, which &s;tood at the town of that name, in the lord&s;hip of Klettenberg, and principality of Halber&s;tadt, was founded in 1127, by Adelheida, con&s;ort to Volkmar, count of Klettenberg, for monks of the Ci&s;tercian order. It was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;everal e&s;tates, farms, manors, pa&s;tures, waters, woods, mills, and other e&s;tates, in the towns of North-hau&s;en, Go&s;zlar, Got|tingen, and O&s;terwick. At the peace of We&s;tpha|lia it was &s;ecularized, and a&s;&s;igned to the dukes of Brun&s;wic and Luneburg, as an hereditary fief; and, in 1672, de&s;cended, by compact, to the prince of Brun&s;wic Wolfenbuttel, who is &s;till in po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion of it as a bailiwic, paying an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of SCHWARZBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This principality lies in Thuringia. The &s;outh part is &s;eparated from the north, and &s;urrounded by the principality of Coburg, Altenburg, Ei&s;e|nach, and the territory of Erfurt; as the north is by the circle of Thuringia, the electorate of Saxo|ny, the counties of Stolberg, Hohen&s;tein, and Eichsfelde, and the territory of the imperial town of Muhlhau&s;en. In this principality are many fer|tile &s;pots, yielding all kinds of grain, fruit, and roots. Some places al&s;o yield tolerable wine, and others are covered with large fore&s;ts, in which a great deal of timber is annually felled, and the greater part of it exported. The&s;e fore&s;ts abound with game and veni&s;on, as the rivers and ponds do with fi&s;h. In this principality are al&s;o mines of &s;ilver and copper, &s;alt &s;prings, together with beautiful red and white alaba&s;ter. The principal rivers in the upper part are the Schwarze, which contains particles of gold, the Ilm, the Saale, and the Gera. In the lower are the Helme, the Zor|gange, the Wipper, and the Helbe. The inha|bitants, who are Lutherans, as well as their princes, are &s;aid to amount to about one hundred thou&s;and. At pre&s;ent there are two branches of the hou&s;e of Schwarzburg, viz. tho&s;e of Sonder&s;hau&s;en and Rudol&s;tadt, both which have been rai&s;ed to the dignity of princes of the empire, and have obtained both &s;eat and voice at the diet in the col|lege of princes. They have al&s;o the title of grand|ma&s;ters of the hor&s;e and hunt&s;men to the empire.
<PB N="400" REF="4080">
Their title runs thus: Princes of Schwarzburg, of the four counts of the empire, counts of Ho|hen&s;tein, lords of Arn&s;tadt, Sonder&s;hau&s;en, Lau|tenberg, Lohra, and Klettenberg. To a Roman month their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is two hundred florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar one hundred and thirty|&s;even rix-dollars. Some of their lands are held as fiefs of the hou&s;e of Saxony, to whom they pay an acknowledgment in money yearly, and to who&s;e courts appeals lie from tho&s;e of the principality. Both princes have their colleges, and officers civil and military. When the empire is engaged in a war, they furni&s;h, together with the count of Reu&s;|&s;en, a regiment con&s;i&s;ting of a thou&s;and men. Be&s;ides the fiefs held of Saxony, there are others, which they hold of the empire, Bohemia, Mentz, Magdeburg, He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el, the bi&s;hoprics of Fulda, and Sonnen-Lehen. In the territories belonging to the Sonder&s;hau&s;en branch, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Arn&s;tadt on the Gera, over which is a hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge of &s;ix arches. On the &s;ame river al&s;o are &s;ome bra&s;s and iron works, with &s;everal mills, and a &s;altpetre-hou&s;e, near the town, in which are two palaces belonging to the prince, &s;everal churches, and a public &s;chool. Arn&s;tadt belong|ed formerly to the dukes of Saxony, afterwards to the abbey of Hersfeld, and at la&s;t came, by pur|cha&s;e, to the counts of Schawarzburg. It gives name to a lord&s;hip, which lies in the upper part of the principality, and is a fief of Saxe-Weimar.</P>

Langewie&s;en and Breitenbach, both of which &s;tand on the Ilm, the former being a fief of Mentz, and the latter containing a palace be|longing to the prince. In the neighbourhood of the latter is al&s;o a mine, yielding &s;ulphur, alum, and vitriol. In the &s;ame bailiwic likewi&s;e, at Go|litz&s;chthal on the Raheberge, near the Schwarze, are fine mine-works, with a &s;tamping and &s;awing|mill, a gold wa&s;h, and a &s;training-hou&s;e.

Its head, on which the right-hand re&s;ts, is large and di&s;proportionate, with a hole in the top of it, its belly prominent and hollow. In&s;tead of a mouth, there is a round hole. The legs are mutilated, and the right bent. The middle of the left-arm al&s;o, which re&s;ts on his lap, is broken off. This town is the &s;eat of the prince's courts and offices, and gives name to a bailiwic, in which were formerly the ca&s;tles of Jechaburg, and Spa|tenberg;

It is mountainous and woody, yet has &s;ome good corn land, vineyards, and pa&s;tures. There is al&s;o a &s;alt-work in it, and a mine of a blacki&s;h glitter|ing kind of &s;late, from which is extracted copper and &s;ilver, but in far le&s;s quantities than formerly, when a quintal of that &s;late yielded betwixt three and four pounds of copper, and a quintal of cop|per ten or twelve ounces of &s;ilver. In the &s;late are lively repre&s;entations, in fair copper-&s;trokes, of fi&s;hes of &s;everal &s;orts, frogs, water-rats, and other animals. There are two con&s;iderable lakes in this county, one of which is &s;alt, and the other fre&s;h, tho' they are very near one another, and even com|municate. Both abound with fi&s;h and water|fowl. The principal rivers and &s;treams are the Salze, the Schlenze, the Eine, and the Woyta, or Weita. In the whole country are &s;even towns. The inhabitants, for the mo&s;t part, are Lutherans, under a general &s;uperintendent The hou&s;e of Mansfeld is de&s;cended from Burkhard, who in 1219 was lord of Querfurt, count of Mansfeld and Hardeck, and burgrave of Magdeburg.

Both the counts and their &s;ubjects are Lutherans. There are two towns in the coun|ty, and twenty-eight pari&s;hes, under a &s;uperin|tendent. The bailiwics of Heeringen and Kilbra are held jointly by the counts of Stolberg and the princes of Schwarzburg. The hou&s;e of Stolberg is one of the mo&s;t antient hou&s;es in Germany. It is divided into the two chief lines of Wernigerode and Stolberg: and the&s;e are again &s;ubdivided, the fir&s;t into Wernigerode and Geder, of which Geder hath been rai&s;ed to the dignity of a prince of the empire, and the latter into that of Stolberg-Stol|berg, and Stolberg-Ro&s;zla. The&s;e counts, in the diets of the empire, belong to the college of the imperial counts of the Wetterau, having al&s;o a &s;eat and voice in the diets of the circle.

<HEAD>The COUNTY of WERNIGERODE.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies on the borders of the principa|lity of Halber&s;tadt, in the Lower Harz, and is a|bout twelve miles in length, and nine in breadth. One part of it is level, and the other mountainous. Among the mountains is the great Brocken, or Block&s;berg, in Latin Mons-Bructerus, reckoned by &s;ome the highe&s;t in Germany. The &s;now lies upon the northern parts of it almo&s;t the whole &s;ummer.

The inhabitants are Lutherans, divided into twen|ty-one pari&s;hes, under a &s;uperintendent. The county belongs to that branch of the counts of Mansfeld, which takes its title from it, and is a fief of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, as margrave of Bran|benburg,
<PB N="409" REF="4170">
who &s;hares with the count the revenue, juri&s;diction, and other regalia. The revenue is very con&s;iderable, amounting to no le&s;s than fifty-thou&s;and rixdollars per annum. The county is divided into &s;ix bailiwics, in which the places of mo&s;t note are,</P>

The town con&s;i&s;ts of three parts, viz. the Old and New Towns, and the &s;u|burb of No&s;chenrode, in all which are upwards of eight hundred hou&s;es, and the whole may be laid under water by means of the Zillicher rivulet. To the corporation belong large woods, out of which the burghers are allowed timber for building, with a certain quantity of wood annually for fuel. The inhabitants are employed chiefly in brewing, di&s;|tilling, and manufactures of cloth and woollen &s;tuffs. Along the Zilliche, near the town, are &s;everal meal, oil, fulling, &s;awing, and other mills; and a little farther off, is a copper-mill, belonging to the corporation.

<HEAD>The COUNTY of BARBY.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies on the Elbe, and is &s;urrounded by Gommern, a Saxon bailiwic, the duchy of Magdeburg, and the principality of Anhalt. In 1695, the family of the counts of Barby failing in the per&s;on of count Augu&s;tus Lewis, the pro|per county of Barby went to the electoral hou&s;e of Saxony; Mulingen and Walther-Nienburg, to that of Anhalt-Zerb&s;t, as a Saxon fief; and the lord&s;hips of Ro&s;enburg and Egeln were annexed to the duchy of Magdeburg. In the proper county, which, at pre&s;ent, forms a part of the circular bailiwic of Wittenberg, the only place worth mentioning is that which gives name to it, viz. Barby, a &s;mall town near the conflux of the Elbe and Saale, and the &s;eat of a &s;uperinten|dency, under which are eight churches.</P>

<HEAD>The LORDSHIPS of the COUNTS of REUSSEN.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e lord&s;hips form a part of the Vogtland, and, except the lord&s;hip of Gera, which lies &s;e|parate from the re&s;t, are &s;urrounded by the Saxon circles of the Erzgeberg, the Vogtland, and the Neu&s;tadt, the principality of Culmbach, the dio|ce&s;e of Bamberg, the Saxon bailiwic of Saalfeld, the bailiwic of Leutenberg, the principality of Altenburg, and the bailiwic of Zeitz. The country is very hilly, but the hills not only yield plenty of wood, variety of herbs, game, and ve|ni&s;on, with &s;ome corn, but are al&s;o rich in me|tals
<PB N="411" REF="4190">
and minerals, as copper, iron, lead, &s;ilver, alum, &amp;c. In the lower parts are fine pa&s;tures, corn-lands, and herds of cattle; and the rivers, the principal of which are the El&s;ter and Saale, abound in fi&s;h. The &s;everal lord&s;hips contain nine boroughs, three market-towns, two hundred and thirty-one villages, thirty-eight farms and e&s;tates belonging to the count, and &s;eventy-five noble manors. Both the count and his people are Lu|therans, and the principal manufactures carried on by the latter, are tho&s;e of wool and iron. The counts of Reu&s;&s;en derived their origin from the antient Vogts, or advocates of the empire. The line of Reu&s;z-Plauen, which is &s;till in being, was founded by Henry the Younger, &s;urnamed the Ru&s;&s;ian, from whom, mo&s;t probably, is derived their pre&s;ent &s;urname of Reu&s;z. The line of Reu&s;z-Plauen is divided into the &s;enior and junior; the &s;enior is &s;ubdivided into two branches, and the junior into three, and the&s;e again into others; &s;o that there are no le&s;s than eight different branches at pre&s;ent of this family, and of the&s;e all the males bear the name of Henry, being di&s;tin|gui&s;hed by their re&s;pective numbers in the two principal lines. The lord&s;hips are fiefs of the crown of Bohemia, and arriere-fiefs of the empire. The Reu&s;&s;en family has a &s;eat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle among the counts. Their matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, that for Kranichfeld being deducted, is eighty-eight florins monthly, and to the chamber of Wetzlar fifty-nine rix-dol|lars, fifty-four kruitzers. Of the regiment of &s;ix companies furni&s;hed by them and the prince of Schwarzburg in time of war, their quota is two companies, which they con&s;tantly keep on foot in time of peace. The principal places in the&s;e terri|tories are,</P>

Greitz, a town on the El&s;ter, in a valley en|vironed with woods and mountains. The two branches of the &s;enior line, or tho&s;e of Upper and Lower Greitz, are jointly proprietors of this town, and have each a hou&s;e and gardens in it. It con|tains be&s;ides about four hundred and fifty hou&s;es, with a hand&s;ome church, Latin-&s;chool, and orphan-hou&s;e; and has &s;ome woollen manufactures.</P>
<P>Zeulenroda, a town con&s;i&s;ting of about three hundred and fifty hou&s;es, and having a manufac|ture of &s;tuffs and &s;tockings, and an annual fair. Near it al&s;o is an alum-mine. The bailiwic in which it lies, together with that of Upper Greitz, belongs to the Upper Greitz line.</P>
<P>Burg, or Burgk, a ca&s;tle &s;tanding on a high and &s;teep rock, and belonging to the Under Greitz line, together with the bailiwic named from it, and that of Under Greitz.

<P>Schleitz, properly called Schlewitz, a con&s;ide|rable town belonging to another branch of the junior line, to whom it gives title, and who have two &s;eats near it.

the greater part is &s;ubject to the collateral line of Ko&s;tritz. In this lord&s;hip are three market-towns, viz. Tanna, Gorgwitz, and Markt-Hohenleuben, in the &s;econd of which are iron-works. Some of the villages in the government of Reichenfels, are &s;ub|ject to the Upper Greitz line.</P>
<P>Loben&s;tein, a town &s;eated on the Lemnitz, and containing about four hundred hou&s;es. This town gives title to a third branch of the junior line, to whom, with its lord&s;hip, it belongs, and who have two &s;eats in it.</P>

<HEAD>The LORDSHIPS of the COUNTS of SCHONBURG.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e lord&s;hips lie in the Erzgeberg circle of the margravate of Mei&s;&s;en, and contain fourteen towns, in which all &s;orts of manufactures flouri&s;h. The inhabitants are Lutherans, as are al&s;o the counts, except the de&s;cendants of Chri&s;tian-Hen|ry, of the Waldenburg line, who are Roman ca|tholics. Frederic, lord of Schonburg, who died in 1383, was the founder of the pre&s;ent hou&s;e of Schonburg, which is now divided into Schonburg-Waldenburg, and Shonburg Penigk. Both the&s;e lines were rai&s;ed in 1700 to the dignity, the for|mer of princes, and the latter of counts of the em|pire, and both are &s;ubdivided into &s;everal branches. The&s;e counts have a &s;eat, both in the diets of the empire and circle, among the counts. Their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment in the marricula of the empire is forty florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar twenty-&s;even rix|dollars, &s;ix kruitzers. The elector of Saxony is &s;overeign of all the lord&s;hips, the counts of Schon|burg

<HEAD>The COUNTY of HOHNSTEIN, with the LORDSHIPS of LORA and KLETTENBERG.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e territories lie in Thuringia. Though &s;ome|what hilly, they are fruitful in corn and gra&s;s, and abound in woods, cattle, deer, and all &s;orts of game. In &s;everal parts al&s;o are found iron-ore, with good alaba&s;ter and a kind of ja&s;per. They contain five towns and two boroughs. The inha|bitants are Lutherans, excepting a few Calvini&s;ts in the lord&s;hip of Lora and Klettenburg. The county of Hohn&s;tein had formerly counts of its own; but the two branches into which they were divided became extinct, that of Hohn&s;tein, Lora, and Klettenburgh in 1593, and that of Hohn&s;tein Vierradt in 1609. The proper county is now di|vided between the two chief lines of the hou&s;e of Stolberg, and held as a fief of the electoral hou&s;e of Brun&s;wick-Luneburg. The mo&s;t remarkable places in it are,</P>
<P>Hohn&s;tein, a ruined ca&s;tle, which gives name to the county, and a bailiwic. The bailiwic, with the towns of Hohn&s;tein and Neu&s;tadt, in the la&s;t of which is a hand&s;ome &s;eat, belong to the counts of Stolberg-Stolberg: but the fore&s;t of Hohn&s;tein is the property of the counts of Stolberg Wernigerode.</P>

<HEAD>CIRCLE of WESTPHALIA.</HEAD>
<P>ANTIENTLY the people inhabiting between the We&s;er and the Rhine, were called We&s;t|phalians, and hence that tract got the name of We&s;t|phalia: but the circle of that name is of a larger extent, being &s;urrounded by the circle of Burgundy, or the Au&s;trian Netherlands, the United Provinces, and the North-Sea, with the circles of the Upper and Lower Rhine, and comprizing the following &s;tates,
<PB N="417" REF="4250">
viz. The bi&s;hopric of Paderborn, Mun&s;ter, Leige, and O&s;naburg; the duchy of Verden, the principality of Minden, the abbies of Corvey, Stablo, Werden, Cornelis Mun&s;ter, E&s;&s;en, Thoren, and Hervoden, the duchy of Cleve with the county of Mark; the duchies of Juliers and Berg, Na&s;&s;au-Siegen and Na&s;&s;au-Dillenberg, the principalities of Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land and Mors; the counties of Sayn, Wied-Runkell, Schauenburg, Oldenburg, Delmenhor&s;t, Lippe, Bentheim-Bentheim, Bentheim-Steinfurt, Teck|lenburg, Hoya, Virnenburg, Diepholz, Spiegel|berg, Rietberg, Pymont, Gronsfreld, Reckheim, the Seigniories of Anholt, and Winneburg; the county of Holzapfiel; the &s;eigniories of Wit|tem, Blankenheim, Gerold&s;tein, Gehmen, Gym|born and Neu&s;tadt, Wickerad, Mylendonk, and Reichen&s;tein; the counties of Kerpen and Lom|mor&s;um; the &s;eigniory of Schleiden, and the county of Hallermund, to which according to the u&s;ual matricula belong al&s;o the &s;eigniories of Duck, Severn, Kniphau&s;en, Keyl, Mechernich, Ei&s;z, Schlenacken, Wylre, Richold, Drey&s;z, and Scho|nau, together with the cities of Cologne, Aix-la-Chapelle, and Dortmund. That which is called the duchy of We&s;tphali, &s;hall be de&s;cribed under the archbi&s;hopric of Cologne, in the circle of the Lower Rhine.</P>
<P>The &s;ummoning princes and directors of the circle of We&s;tphalia, are the bi&s;hops of Mun&s;ter, al|ternately with the electors of Brandenburg and Pa|latine, as dukes of Cleve and Juliers. The archives belonging to it are kept at Du&s;&s;eldorff. Its quota of men and money is &s;omewhat more than the ninth part of the whole &s;um granted by the em|pire. With re&s;pect to religion it is partly Pro|te&s;tant, and partly Catholic; but the Prote&s;tants predominate, and are at lea&s;t the greater part of them Calvini&s;ts. The air of this country is not
<PB N="418" REF="4260">
reckoned very whole&s;ome, and towards the north is extremely cold in winter. The &s;oil in general is mar&s;hy and barren; yet there is &s;ome good corn and pa&s;ture land: but the fruit is chiefly u&s;ed to feed hogs; and hence it is that their bacon and hams are &s;o much valued and admired. In all other re&s;pects it is certainly the mo&s;t wretched part of Germany; &s;o that it is commonly and ju&s;tly &s;aid, that a traveller will find nothing in it but long miles, &s;mall beer, coar&s;e bread, and the wor&s;t of lodgings. Nor is the character of the people, by all the accounts we have of them, much more amiable than their climate and &s;oil; but this is not &s;o much the effect of the cold barren coun|try they inhabit, as of the tyranny and oppre&s;&s;ion of a multitude of petty princes, by whom they are cruelly fleeced and en&s;laved.</P>

Its greate&s;t length from ea&s;t to we&s;t is about forty miles, and its breadth where wide&s;t thirty. Some parts of it yield good pa&s;ture, and breed abundance of cattle; but it is not very fruitful in corn. There is a heath called the Senne or Sende of great extent, but very bar|ren and de&s;olate. There are however good iron mines in the country, with &s;alt and medicinal &s;prings, plenty of deer and other game; and it is watered with &s;everal rivers abounding with fi&s;h, as the We&s;er, the Dimel, the Bever, the Nette, the great Emmer, the Lippe, the Alme, and the Pader. It contains fifty-four pari&s;hes, in which are twenty-five

market-towns, and &s;ixteen mona&s;teries. The Roman Catholic is the predominant religion of the country, yet there are al&s;o many prote&s;tants in it. The bi&s;hopric was erected by Charlemagne, to|wards the clo&s;e of the eighth century, and the ca|thedral was con&s;ecrated by pope Leo in per&s;on, anno 796. The bi&s;hop is &s;overeign of the coun|try, a prince of the empire, and &s;uffragan of the archbi&s;hop of Mentz. His revenue is about thirty thou&s;and pounds a year, and he is able to rai&s;e three thou&s;and men. In the matricula his a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment is eighteen hor&s;e, and thirty-four foot, or three hundred and fifty-two florins monthly, in lieu of them. Towards the charges of the &s;o|vereign courts of the empire, he pays for each term, a hundred and &s;ixty-two rix-dollars and twenty-nine kruitzers. The chapter con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-four capitular canons, who mu&s;t prove their noble extraction by four de&s;cents. The arms of the bi&s;hopric are a cro&s;s or, in a field gules.

Here are al&s;o a hereditary mar|&s;hal, &s;ewer, cup-bearer, chamberlain, &s;teward, and purveyor. It was in this bi&s;hopric that Quintilius Varus, with the Roman army under his command, was routed by the Germans, under Arminius. The chief places in it are,</P>
<P>Padderborn, which gives name to the bi&s;hopric, and is its capital. It &s;tands forty miles north-we&s;t of Ca&s;&s;el, fifty &s;outh-ea&s;t of Mun&s;ter, and &s;ixty &s;outh-we&s;t of Hanover, being a large, populous, well built and well fortified city. Its name is compounded of Pader, a rivulet which ri&s;es ju&s;t under the high altar of the cathedral, and born, i. e. a &s;pring. It was one of the Han&s;e-towns, and till 1604, an imperial city.

In 1530 an attempt was made to introduce Lu|therani&s;m; but &s;ixteen of the principal citizens who had embraced it were executed, and the re&s;t obliged to abjure it. Duke Chri&s;tian of Brun&s;wic carried off from hence, in 1692, the &s;ilver images of the twelve apo&s;tles, and the &s;ilver coffin of St. Lotharius, and had them coined into money, with this in&s;cription, <HI>God's Friend, the Prie&s;t's Ene|my.</HI> The trade of this town, though formerly great, is now incon&s;iderable; and the inhabitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly by agriculture, and breeding of cat|tle.

It is divided into thirteen baili|wicks, and, though in general but a barren coun|try, has &s;ome fruitful plains, with woods and quarries of &s;tone: and the rivers, the chief of which are the Embs, the Lippe, the Vecht, and the Berkel, abound in fi&s;h. Great numbers of &s;mall black cattle are al&s;o bred in it. The provin|cial diets are u&s;ually held at Mun&s;ter, and con&s;i&s;t

of the clergy, the nobility, and the deputies of cer|tain towns. The inhabitants, except a few of the nobles and gentry, are all Roman catholics. Lu|therani&s;m had once got a con&s;iderable footing here, but was afterwards almo&s;t entirely &s;uppre&s;&s;ed. The bi&s;hop, who is generally al&s;o elector of Cologne, has a revenue from hence of about &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds, and can maintain eight thou&s;and men. In con&s;equence of an unju&s;t cu&s;tom, unknown in the re&s;t of the empire, he is heir to all &s;trangers who die in the country without children. In the matri|cula he is rated at thirty foot, and an hundred and eighteen hor&s;e, or eight hundred and thirty two flo|rins monthly, in lieu of them. To the chamber|court he pays, each term, four hundred and thirty-three rix-dollars, &s;eventeen and an half kruitzers; and in &s;pirituals is &s;ubject to the archbi&s;hop of Co|logne, but at pre&s;ent is him&s;elf both bi&s;hop and arch|bi&s;hop. His chapter con&s;i&s;ts of forty canons, who are all noble. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable places in the bi&s;hopric are,</P>
<P>Mun&s;ter, which derives its name from a mona|&s;tery built here by Charlemagne, and is the capi|tal not only of the bi&s;hopric, but al&s;o of the circle, &s;tanding at the conflux of the river Aa with the Ems, thirty-&s;even miles &s;outh-we&s;t from O&s;naburg, &s;eventy north of Cologne, &s;eventy eight north-we&s;t of Ca&s;&s;el, one hundred and five ea&s;t of Am|&s;terdam, one hundred and thirty-four &s;outh-we&s;t of Hamburgh, and about four hundred and fifty north-we&s;t of Vienna. It is of a circular form, large, and well fortified both by nature and art. The fine citadel, called the Brille, was erected by the famous bi&s;hop Bernard van Galen, to awe the burghers. The cathedral is a &s;tately fabric. The dean and chapter now elect the bi&s;hop; but, till the be|ginning of the thirteenth century, he was nomi|nated by the emperor. This city has been render|ed
<PB N="424" REF="4320">
famous by three remarkable tran&s;actions: fir&s;t, By the peace concluded here in 1648, which put an end to a war of thirty years, occa&s;ioned by the per&s;ecuting &s;pirit of bigotted papi&s;ts, who cho&s;e rather to plunge their country into all the calami|ties of war, than allow the prote&s;tants to wor&s;hip God according to their con&s;ciences. By this peace, however, they con&s;ented, much again&s;t their in|clinations, to grant them a toleration. Secondly, By the di&s;orders and di&s;turbances occa&s;ioned here in 1553, by a parcel of enthu&s;ia&s;ts, called the Mun&s;ter Anabapti&s;ts, who, headed by a taylor, called john of Leyden, from the place of his birth, turned out the magi&s;trates, and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the city, where they perpetrated the mo&s;t horrid villanies and cruelties. After a long &s;iege, during which both the city and country underwent the greate&s;t calamities, the former was taken, and the mock &s;overeign, with &s;ome of his principal courtiers, were executed, and their bones hung in iron-ba&s;kets, on the top of the highe&s;t &s;teeple in the city. Thirdly, For the noble, tho' un&s;uc|ce&s;sful efforts it made in defence of its liberties, again&s;t the tyranny and u&s;urpation of the above|mentioned turbulent and bloody-minded bi&s;hop, Bernard van Galen.

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of LIEGE.</HEAD>
<P>This bi&s;hopric is bounded to the north by Bra|bant; to the &s;outh by Champagne and Luxemburg; to the ea&s;t by Limburg and Juliers; and to the we&s;t by Brabant, Namur, and Hainault. It is very un|equal both in length and breadth; the former being in &s;ome places above ninety miles, in others not half &s;o much; and the latter in &s;ome places forty|five, in others hardly twenty-five. The air here is very temperate, and the &s;oil fruitful in corn, wine, wood, and pa&s;ture. Here al&s;o are mines of lead
<PB N="426" REF="4340">
and iron, pits of coal, quarries of marble and &s;tone, and &s;ome celebrated mineral waters; as tho&s;e of Spa and Chau-fontaine. The principal rivers are, the Maes and Sambre. The manufactures and commodities of the country, are chiefly beer, arms, nails, &s;erge, leather, with the products we have ju&s;t mentioned. The &s;tates of the bi&s;hopric are compo&s;ed of three bodies: the fir&s;t is the chapter of Leige; the &s;econd the nobility of the country; and the third, the deputies of the capital, and the other towns. The three e&s;tates are &s;eldom called together, except to rai&s;e taxes for the &s;ervice of the province, or upon &s;ome particular emergency; but there is a committee of the &s;tates, who meet thrice a week, and in time of war, daily. They are always about the prince-bi&s;hop, to make remon&s;trances, and demand the redre&s;s of grievances. The bi&s;hop is &s;piritual and temporal lord of the whole country; but, as bi&s;hop, is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Cologne. He &s;tyles him&s;elf by the grace of God, bi&s;hop and prince of Liege, duke of Bouillon, mar|quis of Franchimont, count of Looz, Hoorn, &amp;c. His arms for Leige, are, a pillar argent, on a pe|de&s;tal of the &s;ame, with a crown or, in a field ruby. In the matricula he was formerly rated at fifty hor&s;e, and one hundred and &s;eventy foot, or one thou&s;and two hundred and eighty florins monthly, in lieu of them, but now only at eight hundred and twenty-&s;ix. An abatement of one|third has al&s;o been granted of the antient a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the chamber-court, which was three hundred and &s;ixty rix-dollars &s;ixty-two and a half kruitzers for each term. Here are &s;everal colleges which &s;it at Liege, for the government of the country, and the deci&s;ion of cau&s;es, civil, criminal, &s;piritual, and feudal, and of &s;uch al&s;o as relate to the finances. The chapter con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixty per&s;ons, who mu&s;t either prove their nobility for four genera|tions,
<PB N="427" REF="4350">
both by father and mother, before they can be admitted; or if they cannot do that, mu&s;t at lea&s;t have been doctors or licentiates of divinity for &s;even years, or, of law, for five years, in &s;ome famous univer&s;ity. The bi&s;hopric is very popu|lous and exten&s;ive, containing fifteen hundred pari&s;hes, in which are twenty-four walled towns, be&s;ides others, fifty-two baronies, be&s;ides coun|ties and &s;eigniories, &s;eventeen abbies for men, who mu&s;t be all gentlemen, and eleven for ladies, exclu&s;ive of others. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable of the&s;e towns and places are,</P>
<P>Liege, the capital, from which the bi&s;hopric takes its name. It &s;tands upon the Maes, in a fine valley, &s;urrounded with woods and hills, being a free imperial city, and one of the large&s;t and mo&s;t eminent in Europe. Tho' it is one hundred miles from the &s;ea by water, the Maes is naviga|ble up to it. The city has &s;ixteen gates, &s;even|teen bridges, &s;ome of them very hand&s;ome, one hundred and fifty-four &s;treets, many of them &s;trait and broad, a fine epi&s;copal palace, a very large, &s;tately cathedral, in which, be&s;ides five great &s;ilver coffers full of reliques, are &s;everal &s;ilver &s;tatues of &s;aints, and a St. George on hor&s;e-back of ma&s;&s;y gold, pre&s;ented to the cathedral by Charles the Bold, by way of atonement for u&s;ing the inhabi|tants cruelly in the year 1468. Of the other churches, that of St. Paul is the mo&s;t remarkable, both for its &s;tructure and fine ornaments in paint|ing and marble. The city is well fortified, and there are al&s;o two ca&s;tles on the mountain of the Holy Wallburg for its defence. Be&s;ides a great number of other convents of both &s;exes, here is a college of Engli&s;h Je&s;uits, founded in the year 1616, and a fine nunnery of Engli&s;h ladies. In|deed, churches, convents, and other religious foundations, take up the greater part of it. The
<PB N="428" REF="4360">
reader, therefore, no doubt, will take it for granted, that it is a mo&s;t ble&s;&s;ed, holy, and happy city. But however it may fare with the profane, unhallowed laity, it is certainly the paradi&s;e of prie&s;ts, as it is expre&s;sly called, by way of eminence. It is di|vided into the old and new, or the upper and lower, and the latter again into the i&s;land, and the quar|ter beyond the Maes. The hou&s;es are high, and built of blui&s;h marble. In the town and &s;uburbs are twelve public places, or &s;quares, ten ho&s;pitals, a beguin-hou&s;e, and two fine keys, planted with &s;everal rows of trees, for the burghers to take the air; but a great part of that within the walls is taken up with orchards and vineyards. The ma|nufactures of this city are arms, nails, leather, &s;erge, and beer. In St. Williams's convent, with|out the city, is the tomb of the famous Engli&s;h traveller, Sir John Mandeville, with an in&s;cription in barbarous French, reque&s;ting tho&s;e who read it to pray for his &s;oul. Near it are kept the &s;addle, &s;purs, and knife, that he made u&s;e of in his travels. After having &s;een mo&s;t of the cities of any note in the world, he made choice of this to &s;pend the eve of his life in. A little way from the city, on the other &s;ide the Maes, &s;tands the epi&s;copal palace of Seraing, in which the bi&s;hops generally re&s;ide during the &s;ummer. The latitude of this city is fifty degrees thirty-&s;ix minutes, and the longitude five degrees forty minutes.</P>
<P>St. Tren, or St. Truyen, in Latin Fanum St. Trudonis, or Trudonopolis, &s;o called from a rich lord of this country, who, in the year 657, founded the famous Benedictine abbey here, the abbot of which names one half of the magi&s;trates of the place, and the bi&s;hop the other half. There are &s;everal other convents in this town both of nuns and friars.</P>

Vi&s;et, a &s;mall and well fortified town, on the Maes, &s;even miles from Liege.</P>
<P>Her&s;tal, a borough with a ca&s;tle, on the Maes, giving name to a &s;eignory, which formerly be|longed to the hou&s;e of Na&s;&s;au-Orange; but, on the death of king William III. fell to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who &s;old it to the bi&s;hop of Leige.</P>
<P>Borchloen, a &s;mall town giving name to a county, and &s;tanding about fifteen miles from Mae&s;tricht.</P>
<P>Tongeren, an antient town on the little river Jecker, ten miles from Mae&s;tricht and two from Liege. It derives its name from the Tongri, otherwi&s;e called Eburones, who&s;e capital it was. Here at fir&s;t was the &s;ee of the bi&s;hop of Liege, which was removed afterwards to Mae&s;tricht, and then to Liege. In the neighbourhood is a famous mineral water, which Pliny takes notice of in his Natural Hi&s;tory, book 31. chap. 2, and &s;ays that it purges the body, cures tertian agues, di&s;charges gravel, and, when put upon the fire, turns thick and red. Some remains of antiquity are &s;till to be &s;een here.</P>
<P>Hoorn, a &s;mall town with a ca&s;tle, near the Maes, but the capital of a county, which, on the extinction of the male line of its counts, in 1568, reverted to the bi&s;hopric of Liege, of which it was a fief.</P>

<P>Spaw, or Spa, a &s;mall town on the little river Weze, twenty miles from Liege, towards the fouth-ea&s;t. It is &s;o &s;urrounded with mountains, that one can hardly &s;ee it till one is in it, nor get

to it without a good deal of trouble. This place is famous for its mineral &s;prings, which are re|&s;orted to from all parts of Europe, in the months of June, July, and Augu&s;t, and are &s;aid to open ob&s;tructions, concoct cruidities, dry up exce&s;&s;ive moi&s;ture, and to &s;trengthen the nerves and bowels, provided they are properly u&s;ed. Prodigious quantities of the waters are tran&s;ported into fo|reign countries. There are five wells, but of the&s;e only three are much u&s;ed, of which one is in the market-place, and the other two a little way out of the town. The company walk in the Ca|puchins gardens, which are very large. The town, which con&s;i&s;ts of about four hundred hou&s;es, de|pends entirely upon letting lodgings, and &s;elling &s;nuff-boxes and other trinkets to the company. The inhabitants are very good natured, and &s;peak a barbarous French, as at Liege. In the hotte&s;t war, this town is con&s;idered as neutral, and pro|tected from all ho&s;tilities. The neighbouring country is mountainous and woody, and con&s;e|quently not very fruitful in corn.</P>
<P>Huy, the capital of the country of Condres, twelve miles from Liege, where the little river Hoioul falls into the Maes. This town and di&s;|trict were given to the bi&s;hopric of Liege in the year 997. Here is a collegiate church, with ab|beys and convents of almo&s;t every order. That of the Ci&s;tercian nuns, three miles from the town, was founded in the year 1202 by Albert, count of Molra, who laid out all his wealth in founding of convents and other religious u&s;es, after he had lo&s;t his two &s;ons, who killed one another with their lances, while they were practi&s;ing in imita|tion of the combatants at tournaments. Another of the convents here, is the chief of the order of the Holy Cro&s;s, in which the general of that order is obliged to re&s;ide. This city has &s;uffered very

much by the wars of the Netherlands, having been often be&s;ieged and taken, and its fortifications de|&s;troyed. On the river Hoioul, near the town, are &s;everal paper-mills and iron-works, and al&s;o a mi|neral &s;pring. The neighbouring country yields not only corn, wine, and other fruits, but al&s;o iron, alum, &s;ulphur, and coal.</P>

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of OSNABURG.</HEAD>
<P>This bi&s;hopric is &s;ituated in the centre of the circle, between the We&s;er and the Ems, having Minden on the ea&s;t, Mun&s;ter on the we&s;t, Diepholt on the north-ea&s;t, and Raven&s;|burg on the &s;outh-we&s;t. It is about forty-five miles long and twenty-five broad, producing
<PB N="432" REF="4400">
&s;ome rye, &s;everal &s;orts of turf, coals, marble, and good pa&s;turage. The inhabitants, who are a mixture of prote&s;tants and Roman catholics, breed a con&s;iderable number of cattle, e&s;pecially hogs, of which they make excellent bacon and hams; but a great part of the country con&s;i&s;ts of heaths. By the treaty concluded here in 1648, the bi&s;hopric was to be an alternative between the Roman catholics and Lutherans; and the Luthe|ran bi&s;hop was to be a younger prince of the hou&s;e of Brun&s;wic-Lunenburg, or, on failure thereof, of Brun&s;wic-Wolfenbuttle. In con&s;equence of this &s;ettlement, his Britannic maje&s;ty's &s;econd &s;on, a child not quite five years old, is now bi&s;hop of O&s;naburg. The Roman catholic bi&s;hop is cho&s;en by the chapter, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty-five canons, who are not limited in their choice to any particu|lar popi&s;h family. The revenues of twenty-two of the prebends belong to the popi&s;h canons, and tho&s;e of the other three to Lutherans, who are ca|pable of electing, but not of being elected bi&s;hops, as the Roman catholics are. The bi&s;hop is able to rai&s;e two thou&s;and five hundred men, his revenue being between twenty and thirty thou&s;and pounds. The chief manufactures of the country are a coar&s;e kind of linen cloth and yarn, which are &s;aid to bring into it, annually, above one million of rix-dollars. There are al&s;o &s;ome woollen manufactures in O&s;naburg and Bram|&s;che. The land-&s;tates of the bi&s;hopric, are the chapter, the knights, and the four towns. The diets are held at O&s;naburg, when called together by the bi&s;hop. The count of Bar is hereditary &s;ene&s;chal or &s;teward, and pre&s;ident of the college of knights. About &s;ix thou&s;and, it is &s;aid, of the poor pea&s;ants, called Haverlings, go yearly to Holland, where they mow, till, cut turf, &amp;c. and bring home with them about two hundred thou&s;and
<PB N="433" REF="4410">
florins; but many of the pea&s;ants are &s;ubject to &s;ervitude, and belong partly to the chapter and popi&s;h clergy, partly to the nobility, and partly to the burghers. The arms of the bi&s;hopric are an orb gules, &s;et with &s;ix &s;pokes, in a field argent. The bi&s;hop is a prince of the empire, and, in the matricula, is rated at &s;ix hor&s;e and thirty-&s;ix foot, or two hundred and &s;ixteen florins, monthly, in lieu of them. To the chamber of the empire he con|tributes, each term, eighty-one rix-dollars, fourteen kruitzers and a half. Under the bi&s;hop and chap|ter are &s;everal colleges, for the government of the country, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in civil, criminal, feudal, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, and for what relates to the finances. At the yearly land|diet, a voluntary donation out of the ca&s;h belong|ing to the foundation, is granted to the bi&s;hop, which, ever &s;ince the year 1729, has amounted, one year with another, to about one hundred thou|&s;and rix-dollars, be&s;ides the ordinary taxes. The epi&s;|copal deme&s;ne lands yield, one year with another, about forty thou&s;and rix-dollars. The revenues of the chapter, who are all nobles, are computed at between ninety and a hundred thou&s;and rix|dollars. The chief places in this bi&s;hopric are,</P>
<P>O&s;nabrug, or O&s;nabruck, the capital. It was formerly an imperial city, and one of the Han&s;e|towns, but is now &s;ubject to the bi&s;hop, though it &s;till enjoys many privileges, and a revenue of about eight or nine thou&s;and rix-dollars. It has its name from a bridge over the river Ha&s;e, or O&s;e, which divides it into the Old and New Town, and &s;tands &s;ixty-&s;even miles we&s;t of Hanover, and thirty north-ea&s;t of Mun&s;ter, being &s;urrounded with walls and ditches, but command|ed by a mountain within cannon-&s;hot. In the hall of the town-hou&s;e, where the celebrated peace of 1648 was concluded, are to be &s;een the pictures
<PB N="434" REF="4420">
&s;everal of the plenipotentiaries, who a&s;&s;i&s;ted at it. Here likewi&s;e are pre&s;erved, as curio&s;ities, three of tho&s;e large gold coins, which were di&s;tributed by the Anabapti&s;ts in the year 1534, among their followers. The magi&s;tracy of this city, which is re|cho&s;en yearly on the &s;econd of January, is Lutheran, and the churches belong, &s;ome to the Lutherans, and &s;ome to the Papi&s;ts. There are &s;everal convents both of nuns and friars, in and about the town, and two gymna&s;iums or academies, one for the Lu|therans, and the other for the Roman catholics. The cathedral belongs to the papi&s;ts, and contains a trea&s;ure of reliques, &s;ome of which are worth &s;ee|ing. No popi&s;h proce&s;&s;ions are allowed here. Both parties have the full and free exerci&s;e of their religion, whether the bi&s;hop is prote&s;tant or pa|pi&s;t. The bi&s;hop's palace was built by bi&s;hop Erne&s;t-Augu&s;tus, brother to king George I. It is well fortified, and &s;eparated from the town by a bridge. In one of the apartments of it died king George I. in the arms of his brother, on the 11th of June 1727. This was the fir&s;t town in We&s;tphalia, which received the Lutheran doctrine. A regi|ment of &s;oldiers is generally quartered in the town, which, among other privileges, has that of coin|ing copper, of regulating the police, of trying criminals, and of fortifying the town, as they think proper. Be&s;ides the public buildings alrea|dy mentioned, here are &s;everal ho&s;pitals, together with a hou&s;e of correction, a Je&s;uits college, and commandery of the Tuetonic order. The inha|bitants are very indu&s;trious in brewing, making linen, and breeding hogs, and other cattle. In the trea&s;ure of the cathedral is a thin folio, with the portraits of many of the bi&s;hops, drawn with a pen by George Berger.</P>

As to its extent, it is about twenty miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and twenty-five from north to &s;outh. Before the year 1648 it was a bi&s;hopric, but was then &s;ecularized, and given to the elector of Brandenburg, for what he had parted with in Pomerania. The provincial &s;tates here are the chapter of Minden, the prelates and knights, with the towns and boroughs.

Towards the expence of the chamber-court, its quota is, fifty-four rix-dollars twelve kruitzers, each term. The high colleges here, for the diffe|rent departments of government, are, the regency, with the boards of war and domains. The ma|gi&s;trates of health in times of any infectious di&s;tem|per among men or cattle, make the nece&s;&s;ary pro|vi&s;ions, and the provincial medical board take care, that the country be provided with &s;kilful phy&s;i|cians, apothecaries, &s;urgeons, and midwives.

<HEAD>The COUNTY of MARK.</HEAD>
<P>This county has Berg to the &s;outh, the county of Recklinghau&s;en and the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter to the north, the duchy of We&s;tphalia to the ea&s;t, and tho&s;e of Cleve and Berg to the We&s;t. It is about forty miles both in length and breadth, be|longs to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and is thought to have derived its name from being the ancient boundary between Germany and Gallia Belgica. It is a very fruitful country, yielding not only grain, flax, hemp, pul&s;e, and fruit of all kinds, but al&s;o wood, coal, iron, lead, copper, and &s;ilver, quarries of &s;tone, &s;alt and medicinal &s;prings, and abounding in cattle, game, and fi&s;h. There are &s;eventeen towns in it, (exclu&s;ive of boroughs, and one half of the town of Lip&s;tadt) with above an hundred opulent noble families. The inhabitants, both prote&s;tants and Roman catholics, enjoy the free and public exerci&s;e of their religion. Be&s;ides other manu|factures, a great variety of iron and &s;teel wares are made in the county, which had long counts of its own, in conjunction with Cleve; but at la&s;t came to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, in con&s;equence of the treaty of partition concluded between him and the duke of Newburg, concerning the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ion to the territories of the duke of Cleve. The arms of the county are a fe&s;&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of three tran&s;ver&s;e beams, gules and argent. The go|vernment of it is ve&s;ted in the &s;ame high colleges as that of Cleves. For the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice there are &s;ix courts, be&s;ides the royal and noble ju|ri&s;dictions, and a council for the police in each of the four circles, into which the county is divided.

<P>This &s;mall principality lies in the We&s;terwalde, and is in general a mountainous woody country, with &s;ome arable and pa&s;ture ground, and a good breed of cattle. Its manufactures are chiefly tho&s;e of iron and &s;teel, having an iron-mine in the neigh|bourhood of Siegen. Count John the Younger, in 1626, embraced the Roman catholic religion, and endeavoured to introduce it into the country; but the principality, upon the extinction of the line of Na&s;&s;au-Siegen in 1743, falling to the line of Na&s;&s;au-Dietz, and therein to the prince of O|range, hereditary &s;tadtholder of the United Pro|vinces, the prote&s;tants were delivered from their apprehen&s;ions of popi&s;h tyranny and bigotry.

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of EAST-FRIESLAND.</HEAD>
<P>This principality is called Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the other, lying to the we&s;t, and the county of Embden, from its capital.

country throughout being low, mar&s;hy, and moor|i&s;h, and much expo&s;ed to inundations from the &s;ea, to guard again&s;t which, dykes have been erected at a great expence. The pa&s;ture in the mar&s;hes being very rich, abundance of hor&s;es, to|gether with &s;heep, and horned cattle, are bred in them, and excellent chee&s;e and butter made of the milk of the latter. There is not much corn land in the country, and the harve&s;t is later than in other parts of Germany; but there is plenty of turf for fuel, with wild and tame fowl, veni&s;on, and pot|herbs, tho' the la&s;t are not &s;o palatable as in many other countries. The chief river of Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land is the Ems, which, before it enters the &s;ea, di|vides it&s;elf into two branches, forming the i&s;land of Borcum, and called the Ea&s;t and We&s;t Ems.

The Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, Roman catholics, and Jews enjoy here the free exerci&s;e of their religion; but of the&s;e fects the Lutherans are the mo&s;t numerous, and next to them the Calvini&s;ts. A bri&s;k trade in hor&s;es, horned cattle, butter, chee&s;e, rape-&s;eed, barley, and fine linen, is carried on in the country; and at Embden, an A&s;iatic company has been e&s;tabli&s;hed by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who in 1744 took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the principality, tho' the illu&s;tri|ous hou&s;e of Brun&s;wic Lunenburg had a better right, and prote&s;ted again&s;t his inve&s;titure. The king of Pru&s;&s;ia, as prince of Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land, has a &s;eat and voice at the diets of the empire, and circle, in the college of princes. His a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment for it in the matricula is &s;ix hor&s;e and thirty foot, or one hundred and ninety-two florins, monthly; and to the courts of the empire, each term, one

hundred and &s;ixty rix-dollars, eighty-&s;ix and a half kruitzers. The &s;eat of the regency, the war and domain chamber, and other high colleges, is at Aurich. The revenues of the principality are thought greatly to exceed one hundred thou&s;and rix dollars. Places of mo&s;t note in it are,</P>
<P>Aurich, which &s;tands about ten miles from Embden, and is the capital of a di&s;trict, that is mar&s;hy and full of woods. The ca&s;tle here is &s;ur|rounded with ramparts and ditches, and was for|merly the re&s;idence of the princes of the country. The town is garri&s;oned, and contains the hou&s;e in which the &s;tates a&s;&s;emble, a Lutheran church, and a Latin &s;chool. At Rohe, a &s;mall village in this di&s;trict, the antient Frie&s;ians u&s;ed to hold their yearly a&s;&s;emblies under three tall oaks, that for|merly &s;tood there.</P>
<P>Norden, the olde&s;t town in Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land, a|bout fifteen miles from Embden. It is a plea&s;ant, well-built, populous town, with a pretty good harbour, and &s;ome trade. Not far from hence is a tract of land, called the Teel-landen, the pea|&s;ants of which enjoy peculiar privileges, and hold an annual a&s;&s;embly in the town of Norden.</P>
<P>Embden, a large populous city, on the north &s;ide of the Ems, near its mouth. It is &s;trongly fortified, has a fine harbour, and carries on a good trade. By means of &s;luices, the whole neighbour|ing country may be laid under water, and, by artifi|cial canals, large ve&s;&s;els may be brought into the very heart of the city. The people are zealous a&s;|&s;ertors of their liberties, and very indu&s;trious. There are many Jews here, to whom, and all other &s;ects, except papi&s;ts, they allow the free exerci&s;e of their religion. In the year 1750 an A&s;iatic company was erected here.</P>
<P>Jemgum, a large and opulent borough, with a harbour on the Ems.</P>
<P><PB N="462" REF="4700">
Hage, a con&s;iderable borough, giving name to a di&s;trict.</P>

<P>E&s;ens, a fine town, fourteen miles from Au|rich, and twenty-five from Embden, capital of the Harrlinger-land, a tract lying on the German ocean, and taking its name from the river Harle. This tract con&s;i&s;ts of three &s;eigniories, viz. tho&s;e of E&s;ens, Stede&s;dorf, and Wittmund, which had once lords of their own, but came all at la&s;t to the hou&s;e of Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land.</P>

<HEAD>PRINCIPALITY of MORS or MEURS.</HEAD>
<P>This &s;mall principality is &s;urrounded by the duchies of Cleve and Berg, the archbi&s;hopric of Cologne, and the duchy of Gueldres, being bounded to the ea&s;t by the Rhine, and yielding plenty of corn, cattle, and veni&s;on. After the death of the la&s;t count, and his daughter Walpurgis, it came to the hou&s;e of Na&s;&s;au-Orange, and on the death of William III. king of Great Britain, to the elec|toral hou&s;e of Brandenburg, which, in 1648, had annexed the lord&s;hip of Friemor&s;heim, that had been held by the count of Meurs as a fief of the abbey of Werden, to the duchy of Cleve. As prince of Mors the king of Pru&s;&s;ia has a &s;eat and voice in the college of princes of the empire, and

His quota towards the army of the empire, is four hor&s;e, and twelve foot, and towards the expences of the imperial chamber, forty-two rix-dollars, fifty-four kruit|zers. From the territories of this principality, which has its peculiar regency, the king rai&s;es yearly about thirty thou&s;and rix-dollars. The places in it worth mentioning are,</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of SAYN.</HEAD>
<P>In this county are three towns, and as many boroughs. The Lutherans, Calvini&s;ts, and Roman catholics have the free exerci&s;e of their religions. One part of it belongs to the margrave of Bran|denburg An&s;pach, another to the burgrave of Kirch|berg, another to the counts of Witgen&s;hein-Hornburg, and another to the elector of Treves. The two fir&s;t of the&s;e have each a voice in the col|lege of We&s;tphalian counts of the empire, on ac|count of their &s;hare in the county; but in the diets of the circle, they have but one betwixt them. In the matricula the whole county is rated at four hor&s;e and &s;ixteen foot, or one hundred and twelve florins monthly, in lieu of them, and at forty-&s;ix rix-dol|lars, &s;ixty kruitzers, each term, on account of the chamber-judicatory. Of the&s;e a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments the &s;e|veral proprietors pay a certain proportion. The places worth mentioning in it are,</P>
<P>Altenkirchen, a &s;mall town, but the capital of, and the &s;eat of the regency for that part, which belongs to the margrave of Brandenburg An&s;pach.

<HEAD>The COUNTY of WIED.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Wied, with the &s;eignories be|longing thereto, was, on the death of count John, in the year 1595, divided into two equal parts, viz. the Wied-Wied part, known at this day by the name of New-Wied, or the lower county of Wied, and the Wied Durdorf, or Wied-Runkel, part which is called the upper county. The&s;e two parts are &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by different branches of the family, called the counts of Wied-Runkel, and Wied-Wied, who, at the diets of the empire, be|long to the college of the We&s;tphalian counts of the empire, and in tho&s;e of the circle, have a voice next after that of Sayn. Their matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment is four hor&s;e, and twelve foot, or ninety-&s;ix florins monthly. To the chamber judicatory the lower county pays, each term, thirty-two rix-dol|lars, forty kruitzers, and the upper as much. The only places worth mentioning in both parts are,</P>
<P>Runkel, which gives name to one of them, and is its capital. It is a &s;mall town on the river Lahn, containing about an hundred and twenty hou&s;es,
<PB N="465" REF="4730">
with a ca&s;tle, which was formerly the re&s;idence of the counts.</P>
<P>Dierdorf, another &s;mall town in the &s;ame divi|&s;ion, to which it al&s;o gives name. It contains a ca&s;tle, in which the lord at pre&s;ent re&s;ides. In its di&s;trict is dug a fine white marble.</P>
<P>New-Wied, &s;o called to di&s;tingui&s;h it from an|other place with a ca&s;tle, called Old-Wied, is a &s;mall, but regular built town on the Rhine, the capital of the other divi&s;ion of the county, and the re&s;idence of its counts.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of SHAUENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which takes its name from the an|tient ca&s;tle of Shauenburg, lies on the We&s;er, and is &s;urrounded by the principalities of Calenberg and Minden, and the counties of Lippe and Ra|ven&s;berg. It is, in general, mountainous, yet has &s;ome good corn and pa&s;ture lands, together with quarries of free and lime-&s;tone, pits of coal, &s;alt-&s;prings, alum, gip&s;um, cry&s;tals, with gold, &s;ilver, bra&s;s, copper, and iron pyrites. Here are al&s;o woods abounding with ma&s;t, and rivers with fi&s;h. As to its extent, it is about thirty miles from &s;outh to north, and twenty from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and contains &s;even towns, and three boroughs. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants are Lutherans. The county, at pre&s;ent, belongs partly to the king of Great-Britain, partly to the landgrave of He&s;&s;e, and partly to the count of Shauenburg-Lippe. The two la&s;t, on account of it, have jointly a &s;eat and voice in the college of the We&s;tphalian counts of the empire; but, in the diets of the circle, each has a di&s;tinct voice. The whole county, in the matricula of the empire, is taxed at &s;ix hor&s;e, and twenty-&s;ix foot, or two hundred and &s;eventy-&s;ix florins, monthly in lieu of them. To the cham|ber-court
<PB N="466" REF="4740">
both the above princes pay, each term, &s;eventy-five rix-dollars, forty-three kruitzers. The revenue ari&s;ing from the county to both, is about one hundred thou&s;and rix-dollars. In that part of it belonging to the counts of Shauenburg-Lippe, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Hagenburg, an open borough, with a ca&s;tle, and an Hanoverian po&s;t-hou&s;e, from which the in|habitants derive great benefit, as well as from a manufacture of linnen and buckram.</P>
<P>Steinhude, an open borough, on the Steinhuder-Meer, or lake. The inhabitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t partly by fi&s;hing, and partly by a manufacture of buckram and linnen.</P>
<P>Sadthagen, the chief town of the whole county, and well fortified. Here is a ca&s;tle, the antient re&s;idence of the counts, behind which is a kitchen garden, and a &s;pring of mineral water, who&s;e good effects many have experienced. Here al&s;o is an orphan hou&s;e, and a very &s;tately mau&s;oleum, which was erected to prince Erne&s;t.</P>
<P>Buckburg, a &s;mall town with a ca&s;tle, a large and beautiful town church, a new town-&s;chool, a fountain in the market, and a church and orphan hou&s;e belonging to the Calvini&s;ts.</P>
<P>In the landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el's &s;hare, the chief places are,</P>
<P>Shauenburg, an old ruinous ca&s;tle, between Rinteln and Oldendorf, from which the whole county derives its name. It appears, that C. Dru&s;us, &s;tep-&s;on to the emperor Augu&s;tus, built a fort here, which was repaired by the fir&s;t count of Shauenburg, but at pre&s;ent is quite gone to ruin.</P>

<P>Ege&s;torf, formerly a Benedictine nunnery, the revenues of which now belong to the univer&s;ity of Rinteln.</P>
<P>Soltorf, a place lying not far from Rodenberg, where a fine white &s;alt is made.</P>
<P>Rinteln, a fortified town, with the We&s;er on one &s;ide of it, and the Exter on the other. Here was antiently a cloi&s;ter, from which a &s;treet in the town is at this day called Cloi&s;ter Street. The profe&s;&s;ors of the prote&s;tant univer&s;ity in this town are partly Lutherans, partly Calvini&s;ts. The regency for the He&s;&s;ian part of the county has its &s;eat here, together with the con&s;i&s;tory, and &s;uperintendent, and &s;ome trade is carried on by means of the We&s;er.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of OLDENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This county has the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter to the &s;outh; the &s;eigniory of Jever and Jade to the north; the county of Delmenhor&s;t and the We&s;er to the ea&s;t; and Ea&s;t-Frie&s;land to the we&s;t. It is about forty miles in length, and upwards of thirty in breadth. The &s;oil, in &s;ome parts of it, is good, yeilding excellent pa&s;turage, and feeding abundance of black cattle and hor&s;es; in others it is moori&s;h,
<PB N="468" REF="4760">
and yields little be&s;ides turf. Again&s;t the inunda|tions to which it is expo&s;ed, it is &s;ecured by dykes and dams. The kings of Denmark, who have been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the county of Oldenburg ever &s;ince the year 1671, are intituled by it to a &s;eat and voice both in the We&s;tphalian college of the counts of the empire, and al&s;o at the diets of the circle. For the defence of the empire, this county is taxed at eight hor&s;e, and thirty foot, or two hundred and &s;ixteen florins, in lieu of them; and for the main|tenance of its courts, at one hundred and thirteen rix-dollars, fifty-five kruitzers, in conjunction with Delmenhor&s;t. For the civil government of the county and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, there is a regency, with &s;ubordinate judicatories, and for the eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, a royal con&s;i&s;tory, and &s;u|perintendent. The chief places in it are,</P>
<P>Oldenburg, which gives name to it, &s;ituated at the conflux of the Hunte and Haare, and regu|larly fortified. The principal church of St. Lam|bert was the burial-place of the counts of Oldenburg; and the ca&s;tle is now the re&s;idence of the royal &s;tadtholder. In the latter was formerly kept the celebrated horn of Oldenburg, but now in the mu&s;eum at Copenhagen: it is of &s;ilver gilt, and weighs &s;ixty-one ounces, or almo&s;t four pounds. In this town is a pretty good garri&s;on.</P>
<P>Varel, a well built borough, &s;eated in a wood or grove, called the Bu&s;h of Varel. It was formerly the capital of a &s;eigniory, which had a lord of its own. One wing of the fine ca&s;tle here was burnt down in 1751.</P>

&s;upplied with wood. The king of Denmark, who has been in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this county ever &s;ince the year 1671, is intitled by it to a &s;eat and voice in the college of the We&s;tphalian counts of the empire, and al&s;o at the We&s;tphalian diet. Its quota to the army of the empire is two hor&s;e and fourteen foot, or eighty florins, in lieu of them. The govern|ment of it is ve&s;ted in the regency of Oldenburg. The only place belonging to it, worth mentioning, is that which gives name to it, viz.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of LIPPE.</HEAD>
<P>This county is a narrow tract, between Raven&s;|berg and Schaumburg to the north, and Pader|born to the &s;outh. It has &s;ome corn land, but the greater part con&s;i&s;ts of mountains and heath. On the heath of Senner is a &s;tud, which formerly yield|ed, annually, thirty thou&s;and rix-dollars. In the whole county are five towns, four boroughs, and one hundred and fifty-two pea&s;ant&s;hips. The land|&s;tates con&s;i&s;t of the nobility and the towns, and the inhabitants are mo&s;tly Calvini&s;ts. The greater part of this country belongs to the counts of Lippe-Schauenburg and Lippe-Detmold. The king of Great-Britain, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and the bi&s;hop of Paderborn, are al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;ome di&s;tricts in it. The counts &s;tile them&s;elves counts and noble lords of Lippe, and have &s;eat and voice both at the diets of the empire, in the college of the We&s;tphalian counts, and at tho&s;e of the circle. To the army of the empire their quota is, four hor&s;e and eighteen foot, or, in lieu of them, one hundred and twenty florins, monthly; and to the courts of the empire, each term, &s;ixty-&s;even rix|dollars,

fifty-&s;ix kruitzers. Some of the officers and judges are appointed with the advice and con&s;ent of the non-regent lords, the nobility, and towns; and the taxes to be rai&s;ed are &s;ettled at the provincial diets, with the approbation of the &s;tates. The principal places in the county are,</P>
<P>Detmold, a town with a ca&s;tle on the Werra, where the regent-hou&s;e has its u&s;ual re&s;idence. Hereabouts, as it is &s;uppo&s;ed, Quintilius Varus met with his well known defeat.</P>
<P>Lemgow, or Lemgau, the large&s;t town in the county. Here is a Lutheran academy, two Lu|theran and one Calvini&s;t church, one of the count's palaces, called Lippehof, and a noble foundation for ladies, the abbe&s;s of which is always a counte&s;s of the regent-hou&s;e of Lippe.

<P>Sternberg, a ca&s;tle, which gives name to a county, belonging to the king of Great-Britain. This county has that of Lippe to the &s;outh and we&s;t, that of Shauenburg to the north, and the principality of Calenberg to the ea&s;t. It is diver&s;ified with hills and vallies, and well &s;up|plied with wood, game, veni&s;on, and marle; with the la&s;t of which they manure their lands. The&s;e lands are chiefly employed in rai&s;ing flax; but as both men and women apply them&s;elves to &s;pinning and weaving linen, the quantity rai&s;ed is not &s;ufficient for their con&s;umption. In this coun|ty are al&s;o two potteries, and in &s;ome places of it is found a &s;mall tapering &s;tone, which is &s;o hard, that it cuts gla&s;s, and being inca&s;ed, is u&s;ed by jewellers and others.

In the year 1753, count Frederic Charles-Philip yielded up his county, which he had be|fore mortgaged to the king of Great-Britain for thirty years, on condition of his advancing him a &s;um of money, and taking upon him his debts. The count of Bentheim-Bentheim has a &s;eat and voice, both in the college of the We&s;tphalian counts of the empire, and al&s;o at the diets of the circle.

To the courts of the empire his proportion is one hundred and twenty rix-dollars, &s;ixty-&s;ix kruitzers. The county is divided into the upper and lower, which differ from each other not only in regard to tenure, but al&s;o in re&s;pect of u&s;ages, &s;tatutes, and rights. The chief places in both are,</P>
<P>Bentheim, from which the county takes its name, a pretty large borough, thirty miles north|we&s;t of Mun&s;ter, and thirty-&s;ix we&s;t of O&s;nabrug.

<P>Steinfurt, a &s;mall town on the Aa, about ten miles from Bentheim. Here is a Roman catholic and Calvini&s;t church, with a college for the liberal arts, and a commandery of St. John.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTIES of TECKLEN-BURG and LINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>The fir&s;t of the&s;e counties is bounded on the north and ea&s;t by the bi&s;hopric of O&s;nabrug, and on the &s;outh and we&s;t by that of Mun&s;ter. It is about thirty miles long and ten broad, and is pretty fertile in corn, yielding al&s;o wood, turf, fowl,
<PB N="474" REF="4820">
veni&s;on, and quarries of &s;tone. In the rivers and brooks are plenty of fi&s;h. Much linen is manu|factured in the county, the inhabitants of which are all Calvini&s;ts. This county was formerly more con&s;iderable and exten&s;ive than it is at pre&s;ent, the bi&s;hops of Mun&s;ter having got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a great part of it. The count of Solms-Braunfels having di&s;po&s;ed of his right to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia in 1707, the king immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the whole of what is now called the county of Tecklenburg, on account of which he has a &s;eat and voice in the We&s;tphalian college of imperial counts, and al&s;o at the diets of the circle. His quota to the army of the empire, on the &s;ame account, is three hor&s;e, and ten foot, or &s;eventy-&s;ix florins, monthly. To the courts of the empire, he is taxed at forty rix-dollars, fifty-two kruitzers, each term. The regency for Tecklenburg and Lingen counties has its &s;eat at the latter of the&s;e towns, but the provincial judicatory at the former. The &s;overeigns domains in Tecklenburg bring in yearly about twenty-four thou&s;and rix-dollars. The capital of the county and the only town in it worth mention|ing, is that which gives name to it, viz.</P>
<P>Tecklenburg, a &s;mall place, with an antient ca&s;tle. In the pari&s;h of Lehden is a noble free temporal foundation for nine ladies, and an abbe&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of LINGEN.</HEAD>
<P>This county lies between the bi&s;hoprics of Mun|&s;ter and O&s;nabrug, and is about fifteen miles long, and ten broad. The &s;oil, in general, is tolerably fertile, and it has &s;ome good pits of coal, and quar|ries of &s;tone. Though Calvini&s;m is here the e&s;|tabli&s;hed religion, yet the greater part of the inha|bitants are Roman catholics, and a few of them Lu|therans.
<PB N="475" REF="4830">
On the death of king William this coun|ty was &s;eized by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, who incorpo|rated it with Tecklenburg, of con&s;equence it is un|der the &s;ame regency as Tecklenburg; but whate|ver relates to war, the police, and domains, belongs to the chamber of Minden. The royal annual re|venues ari&s;ing from the deme&s;nes in this county, and taxes, amount to about eighty thou&s;and florins. The only places in it de&s;erving notice are,</P>
<P>Lingen, which gives name to the county, and is its capital. Though but a &s;mall town, &s;tanding near the Ems, it has a Lutheran, Calvini&s;t, and Roman catholic church, with an academy, or gym|na&s;ium, founded by William III. prince of Orange. Not far from it is a ferry over the Ems, called Lin|gen-ferry.</P>
<P>Ibbenbuhren, a &s;mall town, near which are quar|ries of &s;tone, and coal-pits.</P>
<P>Rheda, a &s;mall town, with a ca&s;tle, near the Ems. It is the capital of a &s;eigniory belonging to the counts of Tecklenburg-Limburg, but a fief of Mun&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of RAVENSBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This county, which is about forty miles in length, and thirty-eight in breadth, is &s;urrounded by the bi&s;hoprics of Mun&s;ter, Paderborn, and O&s;|nabrug, the principality of Minden, the counties of Lippe, Schauenberg, and Ritberg, and the &s;eig|niory of Rheda. Tho' in general mountainous and &s;andy, it yields good pa&s;turage, corn, coal, and &s;alt, be&s;ides a great deal of flax, hemp, and wood, with quarries of &s;tone, and mineral &s;prings. The river We&s;er, which runs betwixt it and Minden, is very convenient for the exportation and importa|tion of goods. This county contains nine or ten
<PB N="476" REF="4840">
towns, and about an hundred and thirty villages. It has al&s;o its land-diets. As to religion, there are &s;ome Roman catholics, Jews, and Calvini&s;ts; but mo&s;t of the inhabitants are Lutherans. A great deal of linen, coar&s;e and fine, is manufactured and whitened in the county, and from thence exported, not only all over Europe, but to America. There are al&s;o &s;ome woollen manufactures, particularly of &s;tockings. Upon the death of John William, duke of Cleve, in 1609, the elector of Branden|burg took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of this county, among others, in which he was confirmed by the convention con|cluded in 1666 with the elector Palatine, Philip William. The government of the county is ve&s;ted in the regency of Minden, and the management of the finances and taxes belongs to the war and do|main chamber of that principality. The principal places are,</P>
<P>Bielefeld, the capital of the county, and a pretty large well built town, divided into two parts by the river Lutterbach. Here is a chapter, con|&s;i&s;ting of five Roman catholic, and &s;even Lutheran capitulars, a Franci&s;can mona&s;tery, an orphan|hou&s;e, hou&s;e of correction, infirmary, one Cal|vini&s;t, and &s;everal Lutheran churches, a Latin &s;chool, a great linen manufactory and bleachery, and a manufacture of &s;tuffs and &s;tockings. In the neighbourhood are plantations of tobacco. The provincial diets of the nobility, and their ar|chives, are kept here.</P>
<P>Herford, formerly Hervorden, a large town, &s;eated at the conflux of the rivers Werre and Aa, and divided into three parts, viz. the Alt&s;tadt, the Neu&s;tadt, and the Radewig. It contains &s;e|veral churches and chapels, with a gymna&s;ium, an abbey, a commandery of St. John, a chapter, two Latin &s;chools, and a cloi&s;ter of grey friars. It was
<PB N="477" REF="4850">
once declared an imperial city, but the elector of Brandenburg afterwards took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We have already mentioned the two noble nunneries here for prote&s;tant ladies, viz. that called the Abbey of Herford, and the nunnery of St. Mary. Of the former the abbe&s;s, and all the nuns, are Calvini&s;ts, of the latter Lutherans; but the latter is dependant on the former. The abbe&s;s is a prince&s;s of the empire, having her hereditary officers, with a &s;eat at the diets, and princes and counts for her va&s;&s;als. The revenue of the abbey is about three thou&s;and pounds a year. No vows are impo&s;ed upon the nuns, who are commonly ladies of the fir&s;t quality.</NOTE></P>
<P>Schide&s;che, a hamlet, in which is a foundation for &s;eventeen ladies of noble birth, of whom &s;ome are Roman catholics, &s;ome Lutherans, and &s;ome Calvini&s;ts.</P>
<P>Enger, formerly a con&s;iderable town, with a ca&s;|tle, but now a &s;mall place. Here Widekind the Great had his re&s;idence; and the monument which the em|peror Charles IV. cau&s;ed to be erected to his memo|ry, in the year 1377, is &s;till to be &s;een in the pari&s;h|church.</P>
<P>Raven&s;berg, an old ca&s;tle on a mountain, from which the county took its name, and of which there are &s;till &s;ome remains.</P>
<P>Ver&s;mold, a &s;mall town, where a con&s;iderable trade is carried on in linen.</P>
<P>Bunde, a &s;mall town, where is al&s;o a con&s;idera|ble linen manufacture, and a medicinal &s;pring.</P>
<P>Vlotho, a &s;mall town on the We&s;er, where is a medicinal &s;pring, with &s;ome trade and &s;hipping. In the pari&s;h of Rheme, near this, a con&s;iderable &s;alt-work was erected in 1753.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of HOYA.</HEAD>
<P>This county has Lunenburg on the ea&s;t, Diep|holt on the we&s;t, Minden on the &s;outh, and Bre|men on the north. It is about thirty miles in

length, and nearly as much in breadth. As to the &s;oil, it is, in general, heathy and &s;andy; but there are &s;ome fruitful &s;pots, which yield not only good pa&s;ture, but al&s;o corn &s;ufficient for the inhabitants, and the heath &s;upplies them with turf for fuel.

The king of Great-Britain, on account of Hoya, has a &s;eat and voice in the college of the We&s;tphalian counts of the empire; their quota to the army of the empire for it being two hor&s;e and &s;ix foot, or forty-eight florins, monthly, in lieu of them. As to the imperial courts, a certain &s;um is paid for the whole electoral lands, in which this county is included. The &s;ub&s;idies and taxes levied here are &s;aid to be very heavy. Be&s;ides other rates, there is one towards defraying the expences of em|ba&s;&s;ies, and the maintenance of the univer&s;ity of Gottingen. The mo&s;t remarkable places are,</P>
<P>Ba&s;&s;um, a borough, belonging to the land|grave of He&s;&s;e, where is a noble foundation for ladies, of which the elector of Hanover is &s;upe|rior. In the pari&s;h of Keiligenrode is &s;uch another foundation.</P>
