<HEAD>PREFACE TO THE Monthly Undertaking.</HEAD>
<P>AS the mo&s;t glorious Empires in the World had their beginnings in the little Adventures of &s;ingle Men, or the &s;mall Undertakings of a few; &s;o the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Arts, the mo&s;t u&s;eful Di&s;coveries, and the mo&s;t advantageous Improvements, which the World now boa&s;ts of, bad their Foundations in &s;mall Things, and from thence have encrea&s;ed, and been brought to their pre&s;ent perfection by the applica|tion of private Men, who&s;e in&s;pired Minds have guided them to propagate u&s;eful Knowledge, for the good of Mankind.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Zeal for the general improvement of the World which in&s;pired tho&s;e patrons of Wi&s;dom to undertake great Things, prompts us to give our Age the Hi&s;tory of their Di&s;coveries, and Improvements; that Men of the &s;ame Genius may be encouraged from the &s;ucce&s;s of former Times to pur&s;ue the like u&s;eful Di&s;coveries for the benefit of the Ages to come.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
WE have infinite advantages beyond what the An|tients could pretend to, and va&s;t helps in the &s;earch after Knowledge, which they were utterly de&s;titute of; for we &s;tand upon the &s;houlders of three thou&s;and Years application, and have all the benefit of their Di&s;coveries, and Experiments handed down, gratis, to improve upon, and to encourage our Enquiries.</P>
<P>THEY have &s;earch'd Nature to the bottom, in|&s;ide and out|&s;ide; they have as it were anatomiz'd the Globe, and given us the naked Skeleton of its mo&s;t &s;e|cret Parts, for us to act upon in our farther Enqui|ries: Neither the height of Heaven, the depth of the Sea, or the breadth of the Earth have e&s;caped them; and if they have not di&s;covered all that is to be known, they have nobly led us by the Hand to the very Door, where what remains is to be found.</P>
<P>IT is a mo&s;t plea&s;ant Retro&s;pect they afford us of what is pa&s;t, and Nature adds as agreeable a Pro&s;pect of what is to come; they have open'd her Book, and read far in it, but &s;he &s;hows us many Leaves, not yet turn'd over; and a&s;&s;ures us, &s;he has re&s;erv'd &s;ufficient to encourage, and to reward our future Enquiries.</P>
<P>What's yet di&s;cover'd only &s;erves to &s;how</P>
<P>How little's known, to what there's yet to know.</P>
<P>UPON this Suppo&s;ition, the pre&s;ent Work is found|ed, and we promi&s;e our &s;elves we &s;hall be able, not only to give a plea&s;ing Hi&s;tory of pa&s;t Di&s;coveries, but a profitable view of what may yet be under|taken.</P>
<P>THE Connection of pa&s;t things with pre&s;ent, the State of the antient World, with the State of things Modern, in order to de&s;cribe the growth of things from what they were to what they now are; makes it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to begin our Accounts at the be|ginning of tho&s;e things which we give an account of; how el&s;e could we call our Work <HI>a Hi&s;tory,</HI> much<HI><PB N="v" REF="4"></HI>le&s;s <HI>a Compleat Hi&s;tory?</HI> Nor could our relation of the improvement of Arts, and Science, Navigation, or Plantation, be &s;atisfactory to the curious and en|quiring Reader, if we did not give an account of tho&s;e Arts and Sciences from their beginning, and tell who were the Inventors, who the Improvers, and who the Patrons of them through all the Ages of their improvement in the World.</P>
<P>THUS in &s;howing the growing progre&s;s of that mo&s;t u&s;eful part of the Mathematicks, which we call <HI>Navigation,</HI> and al&s;o tho&s;e &s;urprizing Improvements which we may indeed call the perfection of human Knowledge, I mean of <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> and the Motions, Influences, and Revolutions of the heavenly Bodies; How can we profitably de&s;cribe the things them&s;elves without giving &s;ome account of their fir&s;t Introducti|on; I mean, to whom Heaven fir&s;t communicated tho&s;e Beams of Light; how, and in what manner they have been improv'd, farther and farther in&s;ight into tho&s;e my&s;teries obtain'd, and the Science it &s;elf brought to &s;uch perfection, as we &s;ee it now is?</P>
<P>THE Hi&s;torical account of the advances made by every Age in tho&s;e things may be as plea&s;ing, and in|&s;tructing to the enquiring Reader, as the &s;tudy of the things them&s;elves; and may &s;tir up the curio&s;ity of tho&s;e, not yet fully inform'd, to a de&s;ire of a more perfect Knowledge.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, tho' &s;uch a Retro&s;pect is nece&s;&s;a|ry, yet we have endeavour'd to make our Hi&s;tory of pa&s;t times, (e&s;pecially of tho&s;e mo&s;t remote) as brief as may con&s;i&s;t with a nece&s;&s;ary enquiry into u&s;eful things, and &s;hall dwell no longer upon the dark beginning of tho&s;e things, than to point out the Time and Per&s;ons from whence they are derived: As we come on and advance nearer our own times the nature of things will call for a fuller de&s;cription, and as that de&s;cription will be the more fruitful of incidents, &s;o it will be more agreeable to our curio&s;ity, and more in&s;tructing,<HI><PB N="vi" REF="5"></HI>and particularly as it will kindle new de&s;ires after the farther Di&s;coveries, and Improvements, which are &s;till behind; of which we &s;hall not fail to give a very full, and we believe a very &s;atisfactory Account.</P>
<P>BY this &s;hort Retro&s;pect, we &s;hall have the plea&s;ure of meeting with a va&s;t variety of u&s;eful and plea&s;ant Di&s;coveries, which however they had their time of be|ing accepted, and well receiv'd in the World, &s;eem now to be as it were forgotten, and only look'd back upon in &s;peculation; and yet may for ought we know be profitably reviv'd as much as any thing of that kind can do, and &s;everal others too many to mention here.</P>
<P>WE have taken notice in the beginning of the Work, how many parts of the World which have been peopled and planted, cultivated and improv'd have, by the fate of Nations been again laid wa&s;t, and have re|turn'd to their primitive, undi&s;covered State, and that before the native Wealth of tho&s;e Countries had been fully improv'd, or their &s;ecret Trea&s;ure exhau&s;ted; which Countries (e&s;pecially as the Commerce of the World is now e&s;tabli&s;hed) merit very well to be re|po&s;&s;e&s;t, the parts of them to be again di&s;covered, and &s;earch'd into, and the whole to be re&s;tored to its primi|tive u&s;efulne&s;s for the good of Mankind; &s;uch are the &s;everal Countries of <HI>A&s;ia Minor</HI> now in po&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Turks;</HI> the rich Country of <HI>Ethiopia</HI> on the We&s;t border of the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> the North Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, and &s;everal others; of which a di&s;tinct Account will be given, not &s;o much as to what they have been, but as to the infinite benefit they might now be to the trading part of the World, and that prodigiou&s;ly more than ever they were be|fore.</P>
<P>IN our accounts of Improvements and Di&s;coveries, which are yet behind, and which Mankind have before them for the encouragement of their Indu&s;try, we &s;hall not amu&s;e our Readers with remote and &s;ugge&s;ted po&s;|&s;ibilities, or run them upon dangerous and impracti|cable<HI><PB N="vii" REF="6"></HI>Projects, &s;uch as mad Men cannot, and wi&s;e Men will not meddle with: This wou'd be to puzzle and perplex our Readers wish dark Schemes and uninteli|gible Propo&s;als, which have neither probability of &s;uc|ce&s;s to encourage the attempt, or rational foundation, to make them entertaining to the Reader.</P>
<P>ON the contrary we &s;hall endeavour to &s;how the rea&s;onablene&s;s of every undertaking on one hand, and Feizablene&s;s of it on the other; and if as a whet to the Indu&s;try of the Ages, which may make the attempt, we &s;hould &s;how the certainty of profit to the Under|takers, every Reader will be judge of the Fact, and to every Reader, therefore we make our Appeal.</P>
<P>THE World has been long perplex'd about an in|tricate Affair, which &s;ome have promis'd Mankind they &s;hall one time or other be much the better for, and that it &s;hall he fully di&s;cover'd to them; I mean the <HI>LONGITUDE,</HI> or the &s;ettled di&s;tances of Ea&s;t and We&s;t; we &s;hall in the proce&s;s of this Work endeavour to put an end to the Importance of that Search, by &s;etting two things in a clear light about it.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> THAT it can never be fully and finally a&s;cer|tain'd, and perhaps very little more than it already is, and that therefore 'tis to no purpo&s;e to &s;pend any farther time about it.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> THAT it is not &s;o very e&s;&s;ential to the World, as &s;ome would have us believe, and in &s;hort, that as to the great Article of human Knowledge, 'tis not one Farthing matter whether it be more fully di&s;co|ver'd or no.</P>
<P>IN like manner the World has been long taken up with an enquiry, whether there is not a pa&s;&s;age to be obtained either by the <HI>North-Ea&s;t,</HI> about the North parts of <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> or by the <HI>North-We&s;t,</HI> about the North parts of <HI>America</HI> to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Ja|pan;</HI>
<PB N="viii" REF="7">
and many fruitle&s;s Voyages have been made, and many a &s;tout Mariner been drown'd or frozen to Death, in the &s;earch after the&s;e Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>IN the proce&s;s of this Work we &s;hall &s;how the weak|ne&s;s of all tho&s;e attempts the real impo&s;&s;ibility of the Di&s;covery it &s;elf, and the impracticablene&s;s of tho&s;e Seas as to its being perform'd; were a di&s;covery of a continued Sea really made; and with all we &s;hall &s;how how the World may at a very &s;mall expence come to a certainty is the great Que&s;tion it &s;elf, namely, whe|ther there be really a continued Sea or no.</P>
<P>OUR Schemes of Improvement as they re&s;pect Trade will chiefly con&s;i&s;t of the&s;e very u&s;eful parts.</P>
<P N="1"><HI>I.</HI> THE di&s;covery of &s;everal parts of the World, and pa&s;&s;age to them, which have not been yet known.</P>
<P N="2"><HI>II.</HI> THE farther di&s;covery of &s;uch Parts as are yet, but imperfectly known.</P>
<P N="3"><HI>III.</HI> THE better improving, as well the Soil as the Commerce of tho&s;e Countries which are fully known, and Di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P N="4"><HI>IV.</HI> THE di&s;covering &s;everal branches of Commerce not yet known, or meddled with in the World.</P>
<P N="5"><HI>V.</HI> THE extending our pre&s;ent Commerce into &s;eve|ral parts of the known World, where it has not yet been practis'd.</P>
<P>OUR propos'd improvements of Arts and Sci|ence will be either touch'd at in the &s;everal Heads of Di&s;coveries as we go on, or be &s;poken to under par|ticular Heads by them&s;elves, as occa&s;ion requires.</P>
<P>IT wou'd &s;well this Part too big for a Preface to give a more particular account of all the other Parts of this great Undertaking; we are rather content to venture it upon the Candour of the curious Reader, and expect its &s;ucce&s;s only from the merit of the Performance.</P>

<HEAD>INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_WHEN the Almighty, immediately af|ter the DELUGE, re&s;tored Man to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Globe,</HI> he deli|ver'd it to him as an <HI>univer&s;al Blank:</HI> He bid him <HI>indeed</HI> encrea&s;e and mul|tiply and repleni&s;h it, <HI>that is,</HI> people it, &s;pread a numerous Race upon it, that &s;hould at once both keep Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and enjoy the Product: But he told him nothing of what it was able to do for him; leaving that to his farther Enquiry.</P>
<P>THE World was to him like a rough Diamond, that has its intrin&s;ic Value in it &s;elf; but the Out|&s;ide conceal'd the In&s;ide, and it was for him to po|li&s;h it, that its Lu&s;tre might appear.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Sea</HI> was fill'd with Fi&s;h, but Man had no Knowledge of what they were good for; it was capable of being made u&s;e of for Trade, and Con|ver&s;e of Nations; but Mankind knew nothing of Ships, or Navigation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Land</HI> was capable of producing all the good Things which we have &s;een grow upon its Surface;
<PB N="2" REF="9">
but Man had made no Experience of its Fertility: It had in its Bowels all the Wealth which we &s;ee &s;ince drawn from it; But our Progenitors knew nothing of the means how to come at it, or the method how to manage it when they had gotten it: The Gold was no Snare; the Iron uncapable either of Offence or Defence; the u&s;efulne&s;s of <HI>Copper, Tin,</HI> and <HI>Lead</HI> were of no benefit, for Sci|ence <HI>was not,</HI> and Art <HI>was not,</HI> and in a Word, the Men that Nature produc'd were perfectly and com|pleatly Ignorant of what the World was, or what might be done to bring it to be any thing, but what it appear'd by its out-&s;ide, much le&s;s to what we have &s;ince found it to be: All this was left to the Inhabitants, to find out gradually as they wanted it, and to improve as they went on in the <HI>Di&s;covery.</HI></P>
<P><HI>HOW,</HI> and by <HI>what Steps</HI> the&s;e Di&s;coveries were made, and as near as we can, <HI>when,</HI> and by <HI>whom;</HI> what U&s;es the Di&s;coveries that have been made have been apply'd to; how the Genius of Men is improv'd by &s;uch Di&s;coveries, and how much far|ther &s;uch Improvements may probably be carry'd: The&s;e will be the Subject of our future Enquiry in the&s;e Sheets.</P>
<P>IN this Important Search we &s;hall nece&s;&s;arily Ob&s;erve, how the&s;e <HI>Di&s;coveries</HI> have naturally tended to the <HI>Improvement</HI> of Mankind in all the Parts of u&s;eful Knowledge, and the Tendency an Encrea&s;e of Knowledge has had to encrea&s;ing the Felicity of Man's Life, to the &s;upplying him with Conveniences for living, and In&s;tructing him to the be&s;t u&s;e of tho&s;e Conveniences: <HI>In a Word,</HI> how much Superior every Generation has been, becau&s;e Wi&s;er than tho&s;e who went before them; whether they have been Better, for all their Knowledge, or Wor&s;e, is a Que&s;tion by it &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10">
I HAVE often ob&s;erved that the gradual Improve|ment of the World by tho&s;e early Di&s;coveries de|&s;erves a Hi&s;tory, and really I mu&s;t acknowledge that I think, we very much want that Hi&s;tory, and that on many Accounts.</P>
<P N="1">I. WE are not only Ignorant (in this Age) of the Rea&s;on and Nature of the mo&s;t early Improvements of Mankind, but weakly contenting our &s;elves with our eager De&s;ire of looking forward for more, we really have lo&s;t many of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Branches of Knowledge, and of Art, and are with|out the benefit of many of the be&s;t Di&s;coveries which the&s;e fir&s;t Ages made u&s;e of; &s;ome of which were &s;o beneficial to them, and might be &s;till &s;o to us, if not neglected, and as it were forgotten.</P>
<P N="2">II. SEVERAL Countries, di&s;cover'd and plant|ed by the Antients, the Fertility and Advantage, of which, were infinitely Great, are as it were de|&s;erted again, and left to wild nature; Unpeopled, and over-run with Woods and wild Bea&s;ts, and even, require a New Di&s;covery, and a New Plan|tation to render them u&s;eful to the World, as they ought to be, and as they were before.</P>
<P N="3">III. WE run away now, to <HI>India, China,</HI> the re|mote&s;t Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> to <HI>Chili, Bra&s;il,</HI> and the far|the&s;t Part of <HI>America,</HI> for the very Product and Wealth which the Countries known in the&s;e mo&s;t Early <HI>Di&s;coveries,</HI> are qualified fully to &s;upply us with; and perhaps with half the Hazard, Trouble, and Experience as the other.</P>
<P>THESE and many other Rea&s;ons confirm what I have &s;aid above, that 'tis very nece&s;&s;ary to pre|&s;erve the Memory of the mo&s;t Antient Improve|ments, that we may &s;ee whether we have any need to run &s;o much after New Di&s;coveries, till we make the utmo&s;t Advantage of the Old Ones; and whe|ther, while we &s;trive to po&s;&s;e&s;s new Countries and carry on new Commerce, we do not abandom o|thers
<PB N="4" REF="11">
already known, and leave them to be forgot|ten, which would abundantly &s;atisfy as well our Ambition, as our Avarice, by their Product and Capacity of farther Improvement; without putting us to the Expence of running &s;o far off.</P>
<P><HI>BUT this is not all;</HI> by looking back upon the Early Improvement of the World, we &s;hould with Plea&s;ure &s;ee how Mankind gradually &s;preading over the whole Surface, dip'd into the Wealth and Pro|duct of the &s;everal Countries, by the Indu&s;try and Application of the &s;everal Ages Inhabiting tho&s;e Countries; and how tho&s;e gradual Improvements dropt again as the diligent Inhabitants were re|moved by War, Conque&s;ts, or other Accidents, and the over-running Injuries of Barbarous Nati|ons; al&s;o how ea&s;ily the Fertility and Advan|tages of tho&s;e Countries might be re&s;tor'd, and this Part of the World reap the benefit of it, if due mea&s;ures were yet taken to bring it to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>THESE are &s;ome of the Ble&s;&s;ings we may find by looking back into the former State of Things in the infant World, and e&s;pecially in tho&s;e Nations, which being once the Center of Commerce, as well as of Arts and Sciences, are &s;ince lay'd De&s;olate and over run with a Barbarous People, who utterly neglecting tho&s;e Improvements, have turn'd the mo&s;t delicious Countries, formerly <HI>flowing with Milk and Honey,</HI> into a De&s;olate Howling Wilderne&s;s, and the mo&s;t fruitful Provinces of <HI>A&s;ia, Greece,</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> which formerly maintained Millions of Inhabitants, to be &s;carce able to feed the Wild Creatures that inhabit there.</P>
<P>AN Impartial full Hi&s;tory of the&s;e Things will bring us down by ju&s;t gradations to our own Times. Looking into Antiquity, is a Dry, Empty, and Barren Contemplation, any farther than as it is brought down to our pre&s;ent Under&s;tanding,
<PB N="5" REF="12">
and to bear a &s;teady Analogy of its parts, with the Things that are before us.</P>
<P>OUR Times are as proper, our Circum&s;tances as &s;uitable, and our Genius and Temper, as forward for <HI>Di&s;coveries</HI> and <HI>Improvements,</HI> as any that have been before us, however Antient, tho' we &s;hould look back to the mo&s;t early Times; and give me leave to add, we have as fair a Field for Di&s;cove|ries and for Improvement, even as the old <HI>Phoeni|cians</HI> had, of whom we may &s;ay, they had the whole World before them, our Advantages al&s;o and Ability for carrying on &s;uch Di&s;coveries are infinitely Greater.</P>
<P>IT is true we are fond of running into the re|mote&s;t Angles of the Globe for Di&s;coveries, as if no|thing was able to &s;atisfy us that had been known before, and to tho&s;e who continue that Humour, and think no Improvement can be made nearer home, this Hi&s;tory will be but of little u&s;e; but I am hopeful, that after a View of the&s;e Sheets, there will be but few left of that Mind. I &s;hall in the&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es therefore &s;how &s;ome Schemes of <HI>Improve|ment</HI> and &s;ome <HI>Di&s;coveries,</HI> well worth the under|taking of tho&s;e who have the mo&s;t enterpri&s;ing Genius; and where there is yet room, not for Com|panies and Colonies only, but for whole Nations, and Generations of Nations, even as long as the World &s;hall la&s;t, to plant on, and Time remains to undertake it in.</P>
<P><HI>BUT again,</HI> to tho&s;e who are di&s;pos'd to &s;earch for Improvements where they are to be found, and who are capable of believing that there are things forgotten that may yet be re-a&s;&s;um'd, and things never known which may yet be di&s;cover'd, tho' nearer home, and ea&s;ier to be found than by Cir|cling the Globe: <HI>To &s;uch,</HI> this Work will, perhaps, be as Profitable, as Plea&s;ant, at lea&s;t, we &s;hall give
<PB N="6" REF="13">
them in <HI>Miniature,</HI> and in Speculation, &s;uch practi|cable Things as they may not yet have con&s;ider'd, and as may &s;ome time or other rou&s;e up Adventurers to undertake; that according to the undoubted de|&s;ign of that Providence which made the World, it may fir&s;t or la&s;t be fully Improv'd, its Trea&s;ures fully Di&s;cover'd, and all that intrin&s;ick Wealth which Heaven furni&s;h'd the Globe with, be found out and made u&s;e of, as he certainly at fir&s;t in|tended it &s;hou'd be.</P>
<P>I cannot believe that God ever de&s;ign'd the Riches <HI>of</HI> the World to be u&s;ele&s;s <HI>to</HI> the World; that the Gold, the Silver, the Diamonds, and o|ther Species of &s;uch Immen&s;e Worth and Value, was ever created in the Bowels of the Mountains, and the mo&s;t hidden Parts of the World to lye bu|ried there, and remain unprofitable, till they come to be melted down again in the <HI>General Conflagra|tion:</HI> God will &s;tand in no Need of the Salts and Sulphur, the Minerals and Combu&s;tible Materi|als, which the Earth is &s;o full of, to a&s;&s;i&s;t his Power in kindling the la&s;t Fire, or &s;etting the Earth in a Flame for the De&s;truction of it.</P>
<P>THE Learned <HI>Burnet</HI> in his Notion of the Con|flagration's beginning in <HI>Italy,</HI> becau&s;e the Soil was full of <HI>Sulphur,</HI> and for the more immediate in|gulphing the <HI>Whore of Babylon,</HI> might as well have kindled it at Mount <HI>Heckela,</HI> in <HI>I&s;eland,</HI> where the whole I&s;land is thought to be a &s;olid Ma&s;s of Brim|&s;tone; or about <HI>Newca&s;tle</HI> in the North of <HI>England,</HI> where the Ma&s;s of Bitumen is as proper to &s;et the World on Fire from a Coal Pit, as the other is from a Mine of Sulphur; as for the <HI>My&s;tical Babylon,</HI> I mean <HI>Rome,</HI> (whatever her di&s;tance might be) when once that Flame is begun, I believe the whole Globe will &s;o &s;oon become one immen&s;e <HI>Fire-Ball,</HI> that the <HI>Whore of Babylon</HI> will quickly be in the
<PB N="7" REF="14">
middle of the blaze, without any po&s;&s;ibility of an E&s;cape.</P>
<P>IF then the Subterranean Wealth of the World is yet to be fully trac'd to its Fountains and that &s;ome time or other, it mu&s;t be all made u&s;e of, <HI>as I firm|ly believe,</HI> why &s;hou'd not the&s;e Ages come into &s;ome of it as well as their Neighbours? and why not <HI>now</HI> as well as <HI>hereafter?</HI></P>
<P>I look upon the Northern and We&s;tern Parts of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and of <HI>Africa</HI> al&s;o, and the Ea&s;tern Parts of <HI>Europe</HI> too, to be like Mines of Gold and Silver, which being formerly found out, and as we may &s;ay enter'd upon in part, were left off before they were <HI>half wrought;</HI> the Rea&s;on of it we &s;hall touch at as we go, but the Fact being prov'd, why &s;hou'd we not enter upon the&s;e Works again, that the In|exhau&s;ted Trea&s;ure being farther &s;earch'd into, and the di&s;covering the bottom of them re-a&s;&s;umed, all that Nature had hid, and the Almighty has re&s;erv'd for us, may be found out, and the World made as Rich, and as Learned, in all nece&s;&s;ary Knowledge, as they were intended to be at fir&s;t? and that as their Maker has made a plentiful Provi&s;ion for them, they may let him know how ready they are to ac|cept of, and improve it?</P>
<P>WHY are all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa,</HI> which for|merly were &s;o Populous, &s;o well Inhabited, &s;o Rich, &s;o well Improv'd, and &s;o abounding in Gold and Silver, from their own Mountains, and with Corn and Cattle from their own Plains, abandon'd now to a Generation, who as if bountiful Nature was not able to feed them, <HI>where formerly &s;he fed and enrich'd &s;o many Millions at once,</HI> are as it were driven to inhabit only the Sea-Coa&s;ts, and to &s;eek there, by Rapin and Piracy, to &s;ub&s;i&s;t and &s;up|port them&s;elves?</P>

<P>WHAT blocks up this Commerce now? Nothing, but what might &s;oon and ea&s;ily be removed, name|ly the <HI>Turks;</HI> a People, who even by Maxims of their Religion, are Enemies to all Improvements of this kind, and who rather de&s;olate the Nations, than plant or people them: The&s;e are indeed the Pre&s;ent, and the only Hindrances by de&s;troying the Navigation of the <HI>Nile,</HI> which comes directly from the <HI>Ethiopian</HI> Lake <HI>Dombea,</HI> to <HI>Grand Cairo;</HI> and which tho' there are &s;ome Ob&s;tructions of Cataracts in the Chanel, has yet other &s;maller Chanels, which might pre&s;erve the &s;aid Navigation, as al&s;o the Navigation of the River <HI>Nubia,</HI> which runs in|to <HI>Nile,</HI> and which would maintain a Communication with the Southern Limits of the Greater <HI>Libya</HI> and <HI>Numidia;</HI> of both which I &s;hall have an Occa&s;ion to &s;peak largely in their Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Turks,</HI> if they cannot be removed or per&s;waded to open the &s;aid Pa&s;&s;ages, may not be able wholly to &s;top the Current of &s;uch a benefici|al Commerce, as might be open'd on that &s;ide of the World; if the Trading Nations would join together to undertake it: That Trade may be carryed on many other Ways, as will be explain'd in its Cour&s;e.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. I. <HI>Of the fir&s;t Ages after the Flood, and how Man|kind liv'd for &s;ome time; what Improvement they then made; and how they &s;pread them|&s;elves in the World for the fir&s;t 300 Years.</HI></HEAD>
<P>ACCORDING to the be&s;t Accounts of tho&s;e Times, <HI>Noab</HI> and his Sons coming out of the Ark upon the Mountains of <HI>Armenia,</HI> which are to this Day call'd <HI>Ararat,</HI> or as &s;ome will have it, of <HI>India;</HI> (where being the &s;ame ridge of Mountains they were &s;till call'd by the &s;ame Name) did not &s;pread them&s;elves very far for &s;ome Years, but de&s;cending from the Hill, extended them&s;elves upon the beautiful plain Country, which lyes <HI>South</HI> and <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> of the Mountain, and there began to cultivate the Earth as Husbandmen, for <HI>&s;o the Scripture &s;ays of them,</HI> and to that the Tradition of the People, in tho&s;e Countries agrees.</P>
<P><PB N="10" REF="17">
I doubt not but this Cultivating the Earth, which the Scripture expre&s;&s;es by <HI>Noah</HI>'s being an <HI>Husbandman,</HI> was to be under&s;tood, that he plow'd and &s;ow'd, or dug and planted Corn for Bread for the Sub&s;i&s;tance of his Family and Po&s;terity; and that long before he planted Vines or a Vineyard, as it is expre&s;s'd in Scripture.</P>
<P>THIS Planting and Sowing of Grain for Food, was indeed his fir&s;t Labour, but the planting the Vineyard I call the fir&s;t <HI>Improvement,</HI> for it certain|ly came after the other, a con&s;iderable time: Corn he &s;owed immediately, but Vines he under|took as an Improvement, and which he had none of for &s;ome con&s;iderable time.</P>
<P>HOW long it was between the Year of the Flood and this planting <HI>a Vineyard,</HI> or at lea&s;t before the Vines were brought to Perfection, we have no certain|ty from Hi&s;tory; but this we know from the Scrip|ture, that it was not till <HI>Canaan</HI> the younge&s;t Son of <HI>Ham Noah's</HI> younge&s;t Son, was grown up to be a Man; for <HI>Noah</HI> gives out the heavie&s;t part of the Cur&s;e, for expo&s;ing and ridiculing his Drunkenne&s;s, to fall upon <HI>Canaan</HI> the Son of <HI>Ham;</HI> not upon any of the re&s;t of his Children, or of his Brother's Children; and this therefore could not be &s;uppos'd to be le&s;s than twenty or thirty Years; for <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> he was not born till five Years after the Flood at lea&s;t, being the fourth Son of his Father; and <HI>&s;e|condly,</HI> he mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to be at Man's E&s;tate, for it is the Opinion of the mo&s;t Learned Annota|tors that it was <HI>Canaan,</HI> not <HI>Ham,</HI> that &s;aw and expos'd the Nakedne&s;s of his Grand-father; Why el&s;e &s;hould <HI>Noah</HI> omit his Father <HI>Ham,</HI> and load the Cur&s;e all on the back of <HI>Canaan</HI> his Son?</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I note it on this Occa&s;ion, and &s;o far it is to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> THAT Husbandry was the fir&s;t Employ|ment. And,</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="18">
<HI>Secondly,</HI> PLANTING of Vines was the fir&s;t Im|provement after the Flood.</P>
<P><HI>NOAH</HI> it &s;eems had but ill luck with his fir&s;t undertaking, <HI>viz.</HI> to be debauch'd with his own new Wine; But that was his own fault, not the fault of the Wine.</P>
<P>SOME think as the <HI>Devil</HI> tempted <HI>Eve</HI> to eat, in the &s;hape of a Serpent, that is, as Mr. <HI>Milton</HI> de|&s;cribes it, entered into the Serpent, that he might &s;peak to her by an articulate Voice: So he enter'd here into <HI>Canaan,</HI> and &s;et him to Work, to prompt the Old Patriarch to drink; alledging to him the goodne&s;s of the Liquor, its &s;anative Virtue for the &s;upport of his Age, <HI>and the like;</HI> Drinking to him, or filling to him, and perhaps, pre&s;&s;ing him to drink, till the Old Patriarch was &s;urpriz'd, and took too much, or in &s;hort, till, <HI>as the Drunkards call it,</HI> he drank him under the Table; and then, <HI>Devil</HI> like, made Game at him; for which, his old Grand-father mo&s;t heartily cur&s;ed him.</P>
<P>THIS I take to be a much more rational Account of it, than that <HI>Noah,</HI> who was then in the Seventh Century of his Life, &s;hou'd not under&s;tand the &s;trength of the Grape, or know that the lufcious Juices, if taken too freely, wou'd intoxicate his Brain.</P>
<P>THESE Vines were planted, as the <HI>Greek</HI> Inha|bitants tell us, on the &s;lope of the Hill <HI>Ararat,</HI> towards the South, and where they have very rich Wines to this Day; which they tell you are of the very &s;ame Grapes, tho' not the very &s;ame Plant or Vine that <HI>Noah</HI> planted; and it is not very hard to get Drunk with them, for they are very &s;trong Wines at this time.</P>
<P>FROM hence to the Confu&s;ion of <HI>Babel,</HI> we do not find the Po&s;terity of <HI>Noah</HI> travel'd very far from Home; and that tho' it was 131 Years from the Flood to the end of the Building of <HI>Babel,</HI> and
<PB N="12" REF="19">
by the undertaking it &s;elf, we may &s;uppo&s;e they were very Numerous; yet it &s;eems they had not &s;eparated to <HI>repleni&s;h the Earth,</HI> as God had com|manded them; but had only reach'd to the Bank of <HI>Euphrates,</HI> or <HI>Tigris,</HI> where they dwel't, as it were all together, and &s;pread only round them&s;elves, and thus they intended to live, it &s;eems; or el&s;e they wou'd never have built &s;uch a whim&s;ical Fabrick, and with &s;uch ridiculous Views, namely, that it &s;hou'd reach up to Heaven, and &s;ave them in ca&s;e of another Deluge.</P>
<P>OTHERS are of Opinion that they were not &s;o &s;tupid as we make them; that they did not build it for <HI>a Stair-Ca&s;e</HI> to clamber up to Heaven by, as the Text &s;eems to intimate; but for a Mount to fly up to, in ca&s;e of a Deluge, and that it contain'd in|numerable Vaults and Arches on either hand of the a&s;cent to contain &s;upplies of Provi&s;ions and Cattle, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> for their Sub&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>BUT be it which it will, it was ridiculous e|nough, that's certain, and &s;hew'd that in tho&s;e fir&s;t Ages, they were but very ill furni&s;h'd with Under&s;tanding, either of the Power of God, or of the Con&s;titution of the World; and how ill able &s;uch a Building wou'd be to bear the &s;hock of the Waters of the Deluge, in ca&s;e another &s;hou'd happen.</P>
<P>THAT which is mo&s;t wonderful to me in it, is this, that <HI>Noah,</HI> who was &s;till alive, and his Sons, which we know were all alive at that time, &s;hou'd not be able to convince them of their folly and madne&s;s; but that they wou'd go on with it, not|with&s;tanding all his Cautions, and to be&s;ure, Per|&s;wa&s;ions to the Contrary.</P>
<P>BESIDES, this Work was a Contempt of God's Ble&s;&s;ing, <HI>Gen.</HI> ix. 1, 7. Ver&s;es, <HI>Be fruitful, and multiply, and repleni&s;h the Earth.</HI> And again, <HI>v.</HI> 7. <HI>Be ye fruitful, and multiply; and bring forth abundantly</HI>

<HI>in the Earth;</HI> which evidently intimates that they &s;hou'd &s;eparate them&s;elves, and &s;pread them&s;elves over the Face of the whole Earth, as they were be|fore the Flood, and not keep together in one place <HI>as they were then;</HI> all which their Maker knew wou'd be practicable when their Number came to &s;well, and that even the whole Earth thereabouts, and &s;o cultivated only, wou'd not &s;ub&s;i&s;t and maintain them.</P>
<P>FOR this Rea&s;on Heaven thought fit to confound their Speech, if the Text is to be under&s;tood literal|ly; upon which, and we may &s;ay, as &s;oon as they found the various Dialects, or Speeches, which they now &s;poke, being re&s;trained to Families and Tribes, they immediately &s;eparated, and &s;et out, &s;ome one way, and &s;ome another, upon <HI>New Di&s;coveries;</HI> and this brings on our pre&s;ent main Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BY this Separation of the People into Nations, and their going to &s;eek their Fortunes, <HI>as it may be call'd,</HI> they might be truly &s;aid to wander, <HI>Ubi fata vocant,</HI> as Heaven &s;ecretly directed them; for cer|tainly in their fir&s;t Journyings from <HI>Babel,</HI> which they had been Building, they knew nothing of whither they went, and but little of what they went about; but went &s;ome one way, &s;ome another, as if their chief Care had been only to keep as far off from one another as they could.</P>
<P>AS they travel'd thus, I &s;ay, &s;ome one Way, &s;ome a|nother in &s;earch of new Di&s;coveries, &s;o we cannot doubt but that every Nation made <HI>Di&s;coveries</HI> &s;uit|able to their Enquiries; for the World lay open before them, and where-ever they went they found the Country plea&s;ant, the Air agreeable, and the Soil fruitful, &s;o that every Family had room to choo&s;e in, to their full &s;atisfaction; and according|ly fixing them&s;elves in &s;uch places, as by &s;ituati|on and plea&s;antne&s;s, be&s;t &s;uited them, they &s;oon peopled all the adjacent Countries; and &s;o as their
<PB N="14" REF="21">
Number encrea&s;ed, they went on farther and far|ther, &s;till planting and cultivating as they went.</P>
<P>THEIR greate&s;t Improvements, in their fir&s;t &s;et|ting out, were only &s;uch as tended to &s;ettle the wandering Condition of their Families, and their Properties, in the Countries which they took Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of; as to every thing el&s;e, they &s;eem'd for &s;ome Ages under the mere Law of Nature; their Government was Patriarchal, the Father of every Tribe being the Sovereign, or King of all the &s;ub|&s;equent Branches; every other Father, having Families of their own begetting, bare Rule, as &s;o many Viceroys under the Patriarchal Monarch, as long as he liv'd; and thus they went on till &s;eve|ral Tribes encrea&s;ing, and growing Populous, made them&s;elves Kings and Governours; who, as it con|tinued for many Years after, Governed whole Cities, with the Di&s;tricts belonging to them, as ab&s;olute Monarch, and whom noMan dur&s;t di&s;obey, on the Penalty of Life: As for their Commerce, at lea&s;t, as far as we can come at the Knowledge of it, 'twas wholly confined to the two great Ar|ticles of <HI>Corn</HI> and <HI>Cattle;</HI> both which, as it was the fir&s;t Employment of the People, and they depend|ed upon the&s;e for their Conveniencies and Sub&s;i&s;t|ance, &s;o I do not call them part of their Manage|ment and Improvement at all.</P>
<P>BUT this is not my Enquiry, for I have purpo&s;e|ly avoided all Deductions relating to the Govern|ment of Nations, only ju&s;t &s;o far as it is concern'd with our other De&s;ign, and then &s;hall touch it but very lightly neither.</P>
<P>SIR <HI>Wolter-Raleigh</HI> gives us an Account, very Particular as well as Authentick, of the Rout that the &s;everal Families of the Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> took, after the Confu&s;ion of <HI>Babel;</HI> which as it may be u&s;eful in

<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> ABOUT 130 Years after the Flood, a great Body of the multiplyed Sons of <HI>Noah</HI> journey'd from the Place where the Ark re&s;ted, whether in <HI>Armenia,</HI> or the Borders of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> (is not our bu&s;ine&s;s) to <HI>Shinaar,</HI> and there they call'd a great Council, where they made that wi&s;e Re&s;olu|tion of building a City, and a Tower, &amp;c. which we call <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> THAT from thence, God having con|founded their Language, or as &s;ome have it, their Councils, they &s;eparated them&s;elves, and as the Text &s;ays, <HI>The Lord &s;catter'd them over the Face of all the Earth.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Thirdly,</HI> THAT upon this Separation, the Sons of <HI>Japhet</HI> &s;pread them&s;elves to the North-We&s;t, and inhabited the Le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and all <HI>Europe,</HI> with the Countries of <HI>Armenia, Georgia, Tartary,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> THE Sons of <HI>Sem,</HI> or <HI>Shem,</HI> &s;pread them&s;elves to the South and Ea&s;t, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing all the Country, now call'd <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> part of <HI>Tartary, India,</HI> and away to the farthe&s;t Ea&s;tern Part of the World, even to <HI>China</HI> and <HI>Japan.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fifthly,</HI> THE Sons of <HI>Ham,</HI> or <HI>Cham,</HI> who were the fir&s;t who fell upon the Improvement of Arts and Sciences, and al&s;o Adventures for Di&s;coveries of Nations, went We&s;tward and Southward from <HI>Shi|naar,</HI> and planted the Countries of <HI>Chaldaea, Syria,</HI> and <HI>Canaan, Arabia, Egypt, Ethiopia,</HI> and all <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>THIS is the general Scheme only, of their Sepa|ration, as for the particular Countries, which every Tribe or Family po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and where they planted them&s;elves, as it is too long to enter upon in this Work, and al&s;o is not in my main de&s;ign, I omit the De&s;cription, as not much to the purpo&s;e, in this place, but may touch upon it as we go along.</P>

<P>THE Sons of <HI>Ham</HI> or <HI>Cham,</HI> as I have &s;aid, marching, We&s;t and South-We&s;t, from <HI>Sbinaar,</HI> we &s;hall trace them a little more particularly than the re&s;t, becau&s;e among them we &s;hall find the be|ginning of the mo&s;t u&s;eful Arts, and of the &s;u|blime&s;t Knowledge that Mankind was fir&s;t ble&s;t with, of which &s;uch great Improvements have been made, as we &s;ee this Day; and this is the Rea&s;on of beginning this Di&s;cour&s;e &s;o far back.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e, we find the knowledge of <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> with the Motions and Influences of the Heavenly Bodies; which began fir&s;t to be &s;tudyed among the <HI>Arabians,</HI> and by the <HI>Egyptians</HI> improv'd to a very great Height, tho' under the mi&s;taken Foundation of <HI>Ptolemy;</HI> who&s;e de&s;cription of the Heavenly Bodies, dividing them into Con&s;tellations, and &s;olving the difficult Phaenome|na of their Motions, Revolutions, Eclip&s;es, and Conjunctions, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> is call'd to this Day the <HI>Ptole|maick Sy&s;tem.</HI></P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e, we find the fir&s;t knowledge of Letters, forming of Speech into Words, and the&s;e Words being by prolation of Syllables, and Letters, and the giving Sounds to them made to &s;peak, &s;o as to be capable of conveying the meaning
<PB N="17" REF="24">
of one another at the greate&s;t Di&s;tance, which we call Writing.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e, we find the fir&s;t knowledge of Ships and Ve&s;&s;els to &s;ail and row upon the Waters; joyning thereby the Inhabitants of di&s;tant Nati|ons one to another; and to them we owe the Inven|tion of Navigation, and the Improvement of it, for the benefit of Commerce, the fir&s;t Merchants being found among them.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e, therefore, we are fir&s;t to conver&s;e in the Work before us, and I &s;hall, in a few Words, bring them down to the Times, when the&s;e things were fir&s;t attempted in the World, and then per&s;ue their &s;everal Improvements, as they lye before us.</P>
<P>THE elde&s;t Son of <HI>Canaan</HI> was named <HI>Sidon:</HI> The Family pur&s;uing their Di&s;coveries We&s;t and South, that is to &s;ay, into <HI>Palae&s;tina,</HI> and into <HI>Arabia,</HI> and I take the fir&s;t momentous Di&s;covery, they made as they travel'd We&s;tward, to be that of the Sea.</P>
<P>AS Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> wi&s;ely ob&s;erves, tho' they went on Progre&s;&s;ively &s;preading them&s;elves upon the Face of the Earth, as their number encrea&s;ed, yet they did not ride Po&s;t, nor go on like Travellers; and I add, that they rather proceeded like Planters, who &s;pread gradually, farther and farther, as they found the Country too &s;trait for them, and as their Cattle wanted Pa&s;tures, or as their Plow called for more Land, by the encrea&s;e of their People.</P>
<P>AS then they had, at lea&s;t, 460 Miles from the Land of <HI>Shinaar,</HI> where <HI>Babel</HI> &s;tood, to the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> we may, at lea&s;t, allow them to be thirty or forty Years, if not more, in &s;preading Colonies &s;o far as <HI>Sidon,</HI> and clearing the Lands before them; for it is to be &s;uppos'd, that the Surface of the Earth was generally made difficult to pa&s;s, by the over-growing of Woods in the upper Grounds,
<PB N="18" REF="25">
and the over-&s;preading of Waters and Rivers in the low Lands, which they had Occa&s;ion to pa&s;s over; and that this greatly retarded their Journeying; However, otherwi&s;e, they might be forward enough to go on.</P>
<P>BUT tho', perhaps, <HI>Ham</HI> the Father, much le&s;s <HI>Noah</HI> the Grand-father, never &s;aw the We&s;tern Coa&s;t of <HI>Palae&s;tine,</HI> yet 'tis certain <HI>Canaan</HI> the Grand|&s;on of <HI>Noah</HI> enter'd into, and took Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, and the Land it &s;elf was called by his Name.</P>

How Frightful in the Opinion of &s;ome; How Glori|ous in the Opinion of others; none knowing by any Means, what it was: Al&s;o how much more &s;ur|priz'd, when coming nearer to it, they could perceive that it was <HI>not Land,</HI> but <HI>Water;</HI> that it put an end to their Travels; and that when they came to the Brink of it, they could &s;ee no more Land, nothing but a va&s;t endle&s;s Ocean of Water; and that Water &s;ubject to various Di&s;orders, Storms, Tempe&s;ts, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> Suppo&s;e their Souls fill'd with Wonder and Amazement, they &s;tand mu&s;ing at the &s;ight of it in Di&s;order, and &s;howing what it was im|po&s;&s;ible to conceal, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that they thought they were now at their <HI>Ne plus,</HI> and could never expect to pa&s;s any farther.</P>
<P>WHEN they came to the Shore, they were again &s;urpriz'd to &s;ee even the Sea friendly to them, and af|fording them a variety of Food, little inferiour to the

riche&s;t Diet which God had be&s;towed before; in &s;hort, that it was mo&s;t agreeable living in tho&s;e Climates. Accordingly they re&s;olve to pre&s;cribe them&s;elves, as the Laws of Nature had pre&s;crib'd them, not having the lea&s;t Notion that the Water was Navi|gable, or what Navigation meant; much le&s;s, that the&s;e mighty Waters were appointed to be Sub&s;er|vient to the benefit of Mankind: They had heard indeed of the Ark, and of the Flood, which cover'd the whole Earth, but they had not &s;een ei|ther the one or the other.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III. <HI>Of the beginning of</HI> Commerce, <HI>and</HI> Navigati|on <HI>in the World.</HI></HEAD>
<P>LET not our Readers imagine, from what has been &s;aid, that we &s;hall entertain them only with the dry Subject of Antiquity, and amu&s;e them with the Hi&s;tory of the Worlds Planting: Tho' it be nece&s;&s;ary to bring every thing on gra|dually, and from its Beginning, that the Chain of Hi&s;tory may not be broken, yet the proce&s;s of this Work will we hope not be &s;o Barren of Enter|tainment to the enquiring Readers, as to tire them with the ru&s;ty Fragments of antient Times. The bu&s;ine&s;s of this Undertaking being then to give a true Hi&s;tory of Di&s;coveries and Improvements, and of them only I &s;hall come immediately to the point, and leave the Original of Nations, as it really ought to be, quite out of the Enquiry.</P>
<P>HAVING brought the <HI>Canaanites,</HI> or Sons of <HI>Ca|naan,</HI> whom we are, from hence forward, to call <HI>Phoe|nicians,</HI> to the Sea Coa&s;t, and built <HI>Sidon,</HI> as in the la&s;t Chapter; you mu&s;t allow that the <HI>Sidonians</HI> having but a &s;mall Territory by Land, and being an Ob&s;erving, Diligent, and Improving People, <HI>if I may judge of them by what they were afterwards,</HI> I &s;ay you mu&s;t allow them to be making divers lit|tle Enterprizes upon the Water.</P>
<P>THEY had never &s;een Boat or Ve&s;&s;el, or heard of any, or even of any Sea, except the Ark, and the univer&s;al Flood of Water. If any of them, by the Dictates of Nature, and the frequent Bath|ing them&s;elves in the Sea, had learnt to &s;wim, it
<PB N="22" REF="29">
might, for ought we know, be the only Te&s;timony they had of the boyant power of the Water, and the Rea&s;on of hollow and empty Bodies floating upon it: And this by mere natural Deduction, as a Learned Writer &s;ugge&s;ts, was the fir&s;t hint to them for making hollow Ve&s;&s;els to float, and con|&s;equently, to bear Burthens upon the Surface of the Water.</P>
<P>THERE was directly oppo&s;ite to the Town a &s;mall Shoal, or Sand, which at low Water, &s;eem'd to be an I&s;land, lay Dry, and at &s;ome Sea&s;ons, upon a lower Ebb than ordinary, the Sea wou'd be &s;o far &s;unk, as that they might wade to it; which I&s;land was, it &s;eems, after &s;ome time, rais'd, and taken in, to make a Mole, or Haven to the Town, and &s;o was join'd to the Main-land: But this was not (I &s;ay) till &s;ome Ages, and the fir&s;t Voyage, or Adventure by Sea, that the&s;e <HI>Sidonians,</HI> who were yet young in their Experiments made, was to this I&s;land, which, at mo&s;t, could not be above a Mile from the Shoar, of which pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>To do this, the fir&s;t invention of a Boat was &s;et on Foot; and indeed it was a poor one, and does not come up to the Negroes of <HI>Africa,</HI> or Natives of <HI>America,</HI> who, before the <HI>Europeans</HI> came a|mong them, had their <HI>Canoes,</HI> and <HI>Periaguaes,</HI> made of the Trunk of a Tree, hollow'd in the middle by the help of Fire, and &s;o form'd without &s;o much as any Iron Tool to work with; in which <HI>Canoes,</HI> or <HI>Troughs,</HI> for they were no other, they yet were &s;een &s;ometimes off upon the open Sea, at a very great di&s;tance from the Shoar.</P>
<P>BUT the fir&s;t Boats that we find they made, in the&s;e Countries, and by Con&s;equence, in the whole World, <HI>for the&s;e were certainly the fir&s;t that di&s;covered the Sea,</HI> was a parcel of O&s;yers wreathed, and tyed together, then cover'd with broad Leaves of Flags, which grew in the Rivers there, and were very large
<PB N="23" REF="30">
and thick, and the&s;e again cover'd with the Skins of Bea&s;ts dryed, which wou'd keep out the Water: They were formed into a &s;hape, adapted for float|ing, or &s;wimming on the Water, &s;preading them with Sticks thru&s;t into either Side, to &s;tretch them out, that &s;o being kept hollow, they might &s;wim, and be able to carry &s;ome Weight in them al&s;o.</P>
<P>HENCE the cro&s;s Pieces, placed in the &s;ame, manner in a Boat, u&s;ed now for the Rowers to &s;et their Feet again&s;t when they Row, are at this time call'd <HI>Stretchers.</HI></P>
<P>As the&s;e Boats could go but a very little way up|on the Water, &s;o they did not u&s;e to venture far in them; and u&s;ually, no farther, than that in ca&s;e of a Di&s;a&s;ter, they might &s;wim to Shoar without them. And I &s;uppo&s;e the fir&s;t Voyage that ever was made in the World, after the Divi&s;ion of the Nations at <HI>Babel,</HI> was, as above, from <HI>Sidon</HI> to this little I&s;land, being about a Mile in length.</P>
<P>NOR had the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> for a long time after, any other Boats than &s;uch as tho&s;e, to cro&s;s the great River <HI>Nile,</HI> and even the Red Sea it &s;elf, as ap|pears by tho&s;e Lines in <HI>Lucan.</HI></P>

<P>THE principal u&s;e of the&s;e Boats, for many Years, were only to go a Fi&s;hing under Land, or along the Shoar upon any other &s;mall Occa&s;ion they had.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome time, as the acquaintance with the Sea made them bold, they made the&s;e Boats larger and &s;tronger, till Invention &s;till improveing, they bound larger Sticks together, and made yet larger Boats, and &s;tronger; and then they adventur'd farther into the Sea, till as Fame tell us, &s;ome
<PB N="24" REF="31">
<HI>Sidonian</HI> Fi&s;hermen going too far out in one of the&s;e Boats, a great Fi&s;h, not a Whale I &s;uppo&s;e, becau&s;e they are not ordinarily found in tho&s;e Seas, but a great Fi&s;h, over-&s;et, and over-turn'd one of their Boats, with &s;ix Men in it, who all &s;wam &s;afe to the Shoar.</P>
<P>UPON this Di&s;a&s;ter, nece&s;&s;ity calling for farther A&s;&s;i&s;tance, the Inhabitants laid their Heads toge|ther, and made larger Boats, covering the Sides of them with thin Boards, and &s;trengthen'd within by &s;mall pieces of Wood put together, and tho&s;e Boards again being cover'd with Pitch, or a kind of Bitumen and Oyl, mixt together, to kept out the Water.</P>
<P>AND as they grew more us'd to the Element of Water, &s;o they improv'd in the Art of Building their Boats; but we are a&s;&s;ur'd, that they never attain'd to the Skill of giving Motion to their Boats by the Wind, and by the help of Sailors, till many Years after; and till the City of <HI>Tyre</HI> was built, which was not founded till &s;ome Ages after <HI>Sidon,</HI> and was a Colony of <HI>Sidon,</HI> being built, ac|cording to &s;ome Authors, 240 Years before the Temple of <HI>Solomon,</HI> which mu&s;t be in the Year of the World 2783; but according to others, in the Year 1973, about 300 Years after the Flood, and 170 Years after the Confu&s;ion of <HI>Babel:</HI> For the City of <HI>Sidon</HI> was now large, and begun to &s;pread it &s;elf upon the Coa&s;t every way, but e&s;pecially, Northward, towards <HI>Cilicia,</HI> where they al&s;o built, or at lea&s;t peopled <HI>Tar&s;us,</HI> or <HI>Tar&s;hih,</HI> which was afterwards their <HI>Ar&s;enal,</HI> or Magazine for building of Ships.</P>
<P>BEFORE the <HI>Sidonians</HI> built <HI>Tyre,</HI> they knew but little of the Sea, nor had they arriv'd to the knowledge of Sailing on the Water, tho' they had &s;mall Boats, as above, but that part was afterwards found out by the Citizens of <HI>Tyre.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="32">
THE <HI>Sidonians,</HI> indeed, were grown Rich, Popu|lous, and con&s;equently Powerful by Land; but it was not the <HI>Sidonians,</HI> but <HI>Tyrians</HI> that invented the u&s;e of Sails, and taking the benefit of the Wind in their Boats, as we are a&s;&s;ur'd by the Poet <HI>Tibullus</HI> in the following Line.</P>
<Q><L><HI>Prima ratem ventis credere docta</HI> Tyros.</L>

<P>WE are next to under&s;tand, that in a few Years after the fir&s;t &s;ettling of the Sons of <HI>Ham,</HI> in this Country, <HI>Sidon</HI> encreas'd exceedingly, whether from the plea&s;antne&s;s of its Situation, or the benefit of the Sea for Fi&s;hing, or that they &s;oon began to corre&s;pond with their Neighbours, is not Material; but they grew &s;o Populous, that finding a conveni|ent Situation, not much unlike to <HI>Sidon</HI> it &s;elf, and at but about 14 Miles di&s;tance to the South, they &s;ent out Families, as Bees do a Swarm, and taking Po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion there, they began to build another Town, or City, and call'd it <HI>Tyre,</HI> from the Word <HI>Zor,</HI> or <HI>Tor,</HI> &s;ignifying a Rock; the fir&s;t Town being built on a high Cliff, or Rock, on the edge of the Shore, having a very noble Bay, or Inlet of Water ju&s;t under it, mo&s;t admirably beneficial for Shipping, for &s;ecureing them from all the dangerous Winds,

which blow on that Coa&s;t, and which was, mo&s;t certainly, directed by Heaven, who fore-knew the Occa&s;ion they would afterwards have of &s;uch a Harbour, tho' at that Time, the Builders were en|tirely Ignorant of the u&s;e of it, having no know|ledge of Shipping, or Navigation, of any kind whatever, other than, I have already mentioned, in little &s;orry Boats, without Sails, without Rudders, &s;carce able to de&s;erve the Name of Boats, nor had they any other, for &s;ome Years after.</P>
<P>THIS was the poor and de&s;picable beginning of the Noble, and truly Glorious City of <HI>Tyre:</HI> The Beginner of Trade; the Mother of Merchants; where Commerce had its fir&s;t Birth, and where all the Trade of the World center'd in a few Years after, and continued to do &s;o many Ages.</P>

<P>AS here Trade and Arts began, and afterwards, being well managed, came to flouri&s;h; &s;o in <HI>Egypt,</HI> where <HI>Ham,</HI> the Grand Patriarch of that Race, and in <HI>Arabia,</HI> where al&s;o his Po&s;terity flouri&s;hed, &s;et|tled and became King.

<P>FOR as the People were all &s;wallow'd up with Idolatry; the Devil was not idle among them nei|ther; but as they run into the Study and Know|ledge of <HI>one Art,</HI> he taught them <HI>another,</HI> while they innocently apply'd them&s;elves to <HI>one Thing,</HI> he debauch'd their Fancy with <HI>another:</HI> Thus from the Study of <HI>A&s;tronomy,</HI> he led them, as above, in|to the blind &s;earch after an Infernal Knowledge, by <HI>Magic,</HI> and divers Kinds of <HI>Witchcraft, Divina|tions,</HI> and <HI>Conjurations, Necromancy,</HI> and telling Fortunes, <HI>and the like:</HI> Hence, afterward, they came to Interpreting Dreams, which from the &s;i|tuation of the Country, was call'd <HI>South Saying,</HI> the <HI>Arabians</HI> being Inhabitans of all the <HI>South</HI> Part of the Country, between the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulphs.</P>

But this is none of our pre&s;ent Bu&s;ine&s;s, I return to the early Di&s;covery, as well of Arts, as of the Country, which Mankind made in the fir&s;t Ages after the Flood.</P>
<P>As <HI>Ham</HI> and his numerous Offspring, di&s;covering <HI>Arabia, Palae&s;tine,</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> were thus bu&s;y, &s;et|tling them&s;elves We&s;t, and &s;preading farther and farther into <HI>Afric;</HI> &s;o the Great <HI>Nimrod,</HI> Grand|&s;on of <HI>Ham,</HI> by his Elde&s;t Son <HI>Chus,</HI> made a very particular Di&s;covery, namely, of the Art of Ty|ranny, and &s;ubjecting Right and Wrong to the Determination of Power. How he drew Mankind, who were born free, to embrace a Brutal Slavery, this we have but little light into in Hi&s;tory, unle&s;s we may deduce it from the &s;ignificant important Word, u&s;ed for it in Scripture, <HI>(viz.) a Hunter,</HI> with this Empha&s;is, upon the Word a Hunter <HI>before the Lord;</HI> by which, as mo&s;t of the Learned Expo&s;i|tors, and Annotators tell us, was meant a <HI>Hunter of Men:</HI> and &s;o it imports, that <HI>Nimrod,</HI> being of a furious, bloody, tyrannick Di&s;po&s;ition, fir&s;t &s;ub|dued a few by his mighty Strength, and then &s;ub|jecting them, forced them to &s;erve him in his far|ther De&s;igns, to en&s;lave others, till having thus got|ten a Number together, ready to execute his Com|mands, and over run others with Violence, under his Leading: He thus &s;ubdued Nations, and be|gan Empire.</P>
<P>THUS he hunted down the weak helple&s;s Peo|ple, and &s;et up a Kingdom under him&s;elf, till then unknown in the Word; for he broke the Rule of Elder&s;hip, and Paternity, &s;etting a&s;ide the Patri|archal Kingdom or Empire, which ought to have remain'd in <HI>Noah</HI> (for he was &s;till living) or

THIS, they tell us, was fir&s;t learn'd from an In|genious, or rather a Curious Ob&s;erver of &s;uch Things, who took notice how a great Eagle, which us'd the Shore thereabouts, &s;oaring, and as it were &s;ailing aloft in the Air, in a calm Evening, turn'd her Tail from a Horizontal to a perpendicular or polar Situation, as &s;he had occa&s;ion to guide her&s;elf this way, or that in her Flight; by which turning of her Tail, the Wind which always blows Horizon|tal, pu&s;hing again&s;t the Feathers, who&s;e flat Side lay then towards it, forced the Tail forward, and that again turn'd the Body of the Eagle the contrary way. For Example, If the Eagle flew North, and the Wind blew from the Ea&s;t, the Eagle turning the flat Side of her Tail towards the Wind, and the Wind pu&s;hing the Tail, on that occa|&s;ion due We&s;t, the Head of the Bird would nece&s;|&s;arily be turn'd to the other way Ea&s;t: By the &s;ame Rule a Rudder to a Boat being caus'd to lye in the &s;ame po&s;ture in the Water, as the Tail or Rudder of the Eagle in the Wind, and pu&s;h'd this or that Way by the force of a Man's Hand a|gain&s;t the Water, wou'd nece&s;&s;arily turn the Head of the Boat the contrary way.</P>
<P>THIS method of Steering was for a very con&s;i|derable Time, known only to the <HI>Sidonians,</HI> and that Knowledge purchas'd again, <HI>and perhaps Dear too, at fir&s;t</HI> by the <HI>Tyrians;</HI> and what u&s;e did they make of it? indeed little more than to guide the &s;mall Boats they had, when they &s;hou'd help them for|ward on their Way, and turn them this way, or that way, as their Occa&s;ion &s;erv'd.</P>
<P>THUS Navigation was founded in Rea&s;on, and the Nature of Things, and di&s;cover'd by &s;low de|grees, the Improvement being the effect of daily Experiment, and great Application, be&s;ides Ha|zards, and Difficulties, ay and Lo&s;s too; for as it is &s;aid of Phy&s;ic, that the experimental Knowledge

of the u&s;e and virtue of Plants, Drugs, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> the <HI>Materia Medica,</HI> of which (all Phy&s;ic is Compound|ed) has co&s;t the World dear, by Poi&s;oning many Thou&s;ands of its Inhabitants before the Practice ar|riv'd to the pre&s;ent Perfection. So I make no Doubt, that this <HI>Sea-Knowledge,</HI> as <HI>Navigation</HI> is rightly call'd, co&s;t the World the Drowning many more Thou&s;ands of its People, before the Art of Build|ing, Fitting, and Sailing, or Navigateing Ships, arriv'd to the pre&s;ent Perfection.</P>
<P>AGAIN, as this Art, or Science of Navigation, is of inexpre&s;&s;ible advantage to Mankind, &s;o the Know|ledge of it has been deriv'd from the mo&s;t certain Principles in Nature, tho' it is Conver&s;ant in the two mo&s;t uncertain Elements for its Performances, <HI>viz.</HI> the Wind, and the Water; but I come to the Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>IT was not many Years after the building of <HI>Tyre</HI> before, by the exceeding Conflux of People which from all Parts of the then known World flock'd thither, the Place became very populous, and &s;till encreas'd daily.</P>
<P>THIS great Conflux of People brought on that mighty, and now, mo&s;t important Thing call'd TRADE; which we have Rea&s;on to believe had al&s;o its beginning here, and of which I &s;hall &s;peak at large in the Proce&s;s of this Work; I therefore only name it here to introduce this ju&s;t Note, which is to my pre&s;ent Purpo&s;e, namely, <HI>That Na|vigation was the Parent of Trade,</HI> as Trade has al|ways been the &s;upport and encouragement of Navi|gation: Trade had never been con&s;iderable without Ships, or Ships u&s;eful and valuable without Trade; in a Word, they are the mutual Supports of one another, and may be &s;aid to be conceiv'd and born together, by a my&s;terious Generation, Begetting one another.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t Voyage by Sea, which we are to &s;up|po&s;e the&s;e new Adventurers made, was to the I&s;land of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> which was an important Di&s;cove|ry, and the Climate being found agreeable, and the Soil rich, it became a Colony of the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> tho' it had been, as &s;ome think, peopled before from the Coa&s;t of <HI>Cilicia.</HI> Hence in return for their planting on this I&s;land, they receiv'd the product of the Land, <HI>(viz.)</HI> &s;uch as the Inhabitants, by their Indu&s;try, caus'd it to produce, namely, <HI>Wine, Oyl, Corn,</HI> and other Goods, for the &s;upply of the <HI>Tyri|ans,</HI> and their great City, which every Day en|creas'd in People, and in Wealth.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE, by this Time the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> to be a great and mighty Nation, and the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> Inha|bitants of this Coa&s;t, and the <HI>Sidonians,</HI> the fir&s;t Merchants, extending their Commerce by Sea; For the doing this, they not only built Ships and Ve&s;|&s;els, proper for their Bu&s;ine&s;s; but their Bu&s;ine&s;s encrea&s;ing, they employ'd the <HI>Cilicians,</HI> who in|habited the South Coa&s;t of <HI>A&s;ia Minor,</HI> to built Ships for them, the <HI>Cilicians</HI> being better &s;tor'd with Timber, and other Materials for Building. And this was the Ri&s;e and Beginning of the City of <HI>Tar&s;us</HI> or <HI>Tar&s;hi&s;h,</HI> where the fir&s;t Building Yards and Docks, as we now call them, are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been found.</P>
<P>IT wou'd be a Que&s;tion worth An&s;wering, if we could &s;peak directly to it, what &s;ort of Ve&s;&s;els or Ships, as they were call'd, the <HI>Tyrians</HI> and <HI>Sidoni|ans</HI> at fir&s;t made u&s;e of. But unle&s;s the Model of one of their Boats had been pre&s;erv'd, and could be referred to, no Man can &s;peak with Authority to the Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid, the fir&s;t Builder of a Ve&s;&s;el for Sail|ing, was a <HI>Cilician</HI> of <HI>Tar&s;us,</HI> and that he took his
<PB N="34" REF="41">
draft or model from the Brea&s;t-bone of a <HI>Swan,</HI> which it may be ob&s;erved, even now, is the exact &s;hape of the bottom of a Ship; and that our Ships, of War, or Fregates are built al&s;o after that &s;ame make; the brea&s;t or belly of a Goo&s;e or Duck is the &s;ame; which if critically ob&s;erv'd has the very dimen&s;ions and proportions by which our Men of War are built.</P>
<P>I NAME the Men of War becau&s;e they are, as our people call it, <HI>built for Sailing,</HI> and the Mer|chant Ships, or Ships of Burthen, tho' pre&s;erving the &s;hape in the main part for floating or bearing upon the Water, have yet a greater breath allow'd for their carrying the greater Weight or Loading: But our Fregate built Ships are exactly form'd af|ter the model of a Swan's Body: There you will find Nature working exactly for the occa&s;ion, giv|ing that Creature all the &s;uitable, and ju&s;t propor|tions nece&s;&s;ary to its condition, and to pre&s;erve it in the Element it was appointed to live in; and the Ship Builders were much in the right, they could not have a more exact patern; there you will &s;ee the plain form of the Ship's Bow or Head, the Keel, the Rake, the Stern, and the Bearings, or Sides by which our Ships are formed, and the due proporti|ons both of breadth and length.</P>
<P>DIRECTED thus by the wi&s;dom of Nature, they had nothing to do but by the help of Art to form their work to the Model: This we may be a&s;&s;ur'd was the work of Time, and that &s;o much time, that even till within the reach of our Days, the Art of building Ships, as well as of navigating them in the Seas has been growing, and improving, and whether it may not &s;till improve, I will not affirm, tho' it mu&s;t be acknowledg'd, the pre&s;ent Age &s;eems to have fini&s;h'd that part of Nature's work, and that it is not capable of any con&s;iderable addi|tion; I &s;ay con&s;iderable, becau&s;e the little altera|tions
<PB N="35" REF="42">
in the upper-work ornament, and convenien|ces of Ships, which are daily chang'd like the Fa&s;hi|ons of our Clothes, and which I may rather call al|terations than improvements, are not worth nam|ing in the Que&s;tion; being not e&s;&s;ential to the main end of Ship Building, I mean the Sailing, the bearing the Sea, Turning, lying near the Wind, Staying, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> which the Seamen call the working of a Ship. The&s;e are the e&s;&s;ential Articles of a Ship's u&s;efulne&s;s; without them &s;he is no more than a Trough in the Sea to roul upon the Surface, to lye and drive like the Hull when the Ma&s;ts and Sails are down, or like a mere luggage Boat that is of u&s;e only to carry a Burthen, and not on any dan|gerous occa&s;ion. As to the Building, and carv'd Work, Painting, and Glazing, they are of little im|portance, but are, as I &s;aid above, frequently alter'd and chang'd by the Builders, as our Clothes are by the Taylors, and are peculiar to the Coun|tries or Ports, or Fa&s;hions and Fancies of particu|lar Workmen where the Ships are built.</P>
<P>BUT to come back to the model of the Ships built in tho&s;e Days by the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> the <HI>Cilicians,</HI> and others, who were the fir&s;t Navigators; it is mo&s;t certain that at their beginning they were ve|ry rude, and imperfect, as well as incapable for their bu&s;ine&s;s; e&s;pecially, if they came into any di&s;tre&s;&s;es at Sea; and therefore we find that for many Ages, as well by the in&s;ufficency of their Building, as defficency of the Navigators Knowledge, and want of the Compa&s;s or Magnet; the mo&s;t of their Voyages were perform'd by coa&s;ting along the Shoar, the con&s;equence of which was, that up|on any threatning Storm, or any extraordinary &s;welling of the Sea, they always ran into the fir&s;t Harbour they could come at, and in defect of &s;uch, Harbour, or upon being blown off to Sea, they were
<PB N="36" REF="43">
often &s;tranded on the Shoar, or &s;wallow'd up in the Sea with all that was in them.</P>
<P>THE manner of their Ve&s;&s;els, we may make &s;ome gue&s;s at by the de&s;cription we meet with in Antient Writers, and in the pictures remaining of &s;ome of their Ships, where we find that Ships for War were always row'd by the Mariners, and Sol|diers; &s;ome had twenty Oars in a Bank, or on a Side, &s;ome more, and had a Prow or Beak, as the Gallies have to this Day, but &s;tood much higher; their Merchant Ships were built round, and turn|ing up like a <HI>Dutch</HI> Hoy, and were exactly alike at either end, and thus to be &s;ure was that Ship which the Apo&s;tle St. <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;hipwreck'd in, as may be judg'd by their ca&s;ting four Anchors over the Stern, and afterwards making a &s;hew of ca&s;ting more Anchors out of the Fore&s;hip, <HI>Acts</HI> xxvii. 29, 30.</P>
<P>AS the &s;hape and built of the Ship was the &s;ame in the Head as in the Stern, &s;o the u&s;es were the &s;ame, for they &s;ail'd with either end forward as oc|ca&s;ion required, and rode by the Head or by the Stern, as they found mo&s;t to their advantage, having Anchors at both to ride by. This nece&s;&s;a|rily implies that they &s;teer'd the Ve&s;&s;el not by a Rudder hung to the Stern-po&s;t, <HI>as we now do,</HI> which was turn'd by a Tiller, and a Whip&s;taff, as the Seamen call them, and u&s;ed within the Deck, or by a Tiller only, when &s;teer'd above the Deck; but by &s;ome piece of Wood like an Oar thru&s;t out of a Port, or held out from the Deck of the Ship; and this might be done which end &s;oever went formo&s;t, or if it had a Rudder, then there mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be two Rudders, one before, and one behind, which is not probable, or they had a Rudder which was moveable and loo&s;e, and could be taken off and on, and &s;o be hang'd either afore or abaft, as their Cour&s;e requir'd; and this latter was certainly
<PB N="37" REF="44">
the ca&s;e of the Ship St. <HI>Paul</HI> was in, for in the 40th Ver&s;e of the fore-quoted Chapter, he &s;ays, that re&s;olving to run into a certain Creek, or in &s;hort, being in great di&s;tre&s;s, but &s;eeing Land at a di|&s;tance, they re&s;olved to run <HI>Bump$a$&s;hoar,</HI> &s;o our Sailors term it, to &s;ave their Lives; the Apo&s;tle's Words are thus, Cap. xxvii. v. 40. <HI>And when they had taken up the Anchors, and committed them&s;elves to the Sea, they loo&s;ed the Rudder-bands, and hoi&s;ed up the main Sail to the Wind, and made towards the Shoar.</HI></P>
<P>THIS loo&s;ing the Rudder bands mu&s;t be thus, as they rode by the Anchors, before ca&s;t out at the Stern, they had taken off the Rudder from the <HI>Stern-po&s;t</HI> and had now hang'd it upon the Stem, which was become the Stern for the occa&s;ion; but now taking up the Anchors, and re&s;olving to run the Ship on Shoar, they could not run her on Shoar with a Rudder hanging on the end which was to go foremo&s;t, which was the Stem, &s;o they loo&s;ed the Rudder bands again, that is, unty'd it, and took it off, and then they went forward towards the Shoar.</P>
<P>AND this was plain al&s;o from the fourth Ver&s;e they run the Ship on Shoar, or a-Ground by the Head, which Head, or <HI>fore part</HI> &s;tuck fa&s;t, but the Stern not being on Ground, <HI>was broken in pieces,</HI> as it mu&s;t of nece&s;&s;ity be by the violence of the Sea, the Ship having <HI>broken her Back,</HI> as our Sailors call it.</P>
<P>THESE things are &s;o natural that they give us almo&s;t a full de&s;cription of the Ship, which at the &s;ame time we mu&s;t acknowledge, was a very poor inconvenient, and clum&s;y thing, compar'd to what we are arriv'd to the knowledge of making in the&s;e Days.</P>
<P>IN the next place we find that the Ship St. <HI>Paul</HI> was in, tho' it was a very great Ve&s;&s;el, for it had on Board, be&s;ides its Lading of Corn, 276 people, Seamen, Soldiers, and Pa&s;&s;engers, yet had but one Ma&s;t, and if I gue&s;s right, had but one Sail neither,
<PB N="38" REF="45">
or two at mo&s;t, for Ver&s;e 17. he &s;ays, <HI>Being afraid of the Quick-Sands they &s;troke Sail, and &s;o where driven,</HI> or let her drive, as our People expre&s;s it; <HI>that is,</HI> not being able to carry their Sail they lower'd the Yard upon the Deck; and this is agreeable to the manner of their &s;ailing in tho&s;e Seas, till within a very few Years pa&s;t, when they carry'd no Top Ma&s;t at all, or but very &s;mall ones, but all their Sails lower'd at once upon the Deck if the Wind blew too hard to carry them out.</P>
<P>THIS is the de&s;cription which Rea&s;on gives of their Shipping, from the account which St. <HI>Paul</HI> has left us of his Voyage; and I believe you may take a ju&s;t Idea from it of the manner of their building their Ships, as well as of their ignorance in Sailing <HI>in tho&s;e Days;</HI> and yet <HI>tho&s;e</HI> were <HI>Days</HI> when the Art of Navigation was wonderfully improv'd, com|par'd to what it had been at the building of <HI>Tyre,</HI> or <HI>Tar&s;us</HI> either.</P>
<P>NOW tho' this gives a &s;orry account of the Na|vigation of tho&s;e Days compar'd to the&s;e; yet if we go back again to the times before that, as we mu&s;t do, to form ju&s;t Ideas in our Minds of the fir&s;t improvements of Shipping and Navigation, we &s;hall &s;ee that even with tho&s;e &s;mall beginnings great Things were done, great Enterprizes were gone about, and great Things, not undertaken only, but fini&s;hed.

<P>THESE were great undertakings, con&s;idering the infancy of Navigation, and the ignorance of the mo&s;t knowing Arti&s;ts, for the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> were the be&s;t Navigators in the World without any com|pari&s;on; and as they were the fir&s;t, &s;o they conti|nued the mo&s;t improv'd in the Art of Building Ships.</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="47">
IT mu&s;t be acknowledg'd al&s;o, to their Fame, they were bold Mariners, and that con&s;idering what indifferent Ships they had, without Decks, and con&s;equently but ill furni&s;h'd to keep the Sea; without conveniences to &s;ecure the Men, or to de|fend them, either from the rage of the Water, or from the inclemencies of the Sea&s;ons, covering them&s;elves only with oil'd Canva&s;s, or &s;uch as we now call <HI>Tarpaulins,</HI> and the like, as well to pre|&s;erve them&s;elves from Heat or Cold, and Rains, and Snows, as from the breakings of the Sea upon them, I &s;ay, all the&s;e things con&s;ider'd, they were bold Seamen to venture, tho' it were within view of the Shoars, for they were &s;ometimes, without doubt, driven out of &s;ight of Land, and as we may &s;ay, out of their knowledge, by Tempe&s;ts, and Storms, and no que&s;tion, were often foundred and lo&s;t.</P>
<P>AND after this, when they came to a greater perfection in the Building Art, as in the time when the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Government flouri&s;h'd, they did great things. The <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were a Colony of the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> and inherited al&s;o their Spirit in propogat|ing Trade and Navigation, they were exceedingly encreas'd by the multitude of the Citizens of <HI>Tyre,</HI> who by the help of their Shipping, fled from the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Monarch, as it may be &s;aid, in &s;ight of his mighty Army, &s;hipping them&s;elves off with all their Families, and all their portable Riches, which was infinitely great, and tran&s;porting them&s;elves fir&s;t to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and then to <HI>Crete</HI> or <HI>Candia,</HI> and thence to <HI>Carthage, Utica,</HI> and other Ports, where they planted them&s;elves out of the reach of their barba|rous Enemies, and afterwards grew into powerful Nations, States, and Common-wealths; I &s;ay the Citizens fled thence upon the famous attack which <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> made upon the <HI>Phoenician</HI> Govern|ment, and particularly upon the City of <HI>Tyre,</HI> which

he took and utterly de&s;troy'd; but as the Story &s;ays, found it entirely empty, and without Inha|bitants, that all the Citizens who could get away before the City was blockt up by that furious Prince, with their Wives and Children, and their be&s;t Effects, fled away by Sea to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> and by Land to <HI>Sidon,</HI> making afterwards their more ef|fectual e&s;cape by Sea to <HI>Carthage,</HI> where that City being originally a <HI>Tyrian</HI> Colony, they were re|ceiv'd as free Citizens, and protected, as in Rea&s;on they ought.</P>
<P>THO' the <HI>A&s;&s;yrians</HI> found &s;ome plunder; yet all the Gold and Silver, and all kinds of rich Merchandize of <HI>Africk, Europe,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> which was in the City, was carry'd away by the fly|ing Citizens, and was all convey'd to neigh|bouring Places by Shipping, and afterwards to <HI>Carthage,</HI> the value of which was immen&s;ly great, and was the enriching of that City, and fini&s;h'd its Glory al&s;o, by adding a prodigious number of People to the Citizens.</P>
<P>HERE, as I ob&s;erv'd, the Spirit and Mettle of the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> their enterprizing Genius in Trade, and their particular di&s;po&s;ition to Improvements and Di&s;coveries in the World, continued and &s;pread it &s;elf among the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> who tho' they mingled with it &s;ome of their <HI>Numidian</HI> Barba|rities and Cu&s;toms, yet propogated Navigation, and the planting Colonies in di&s;tant Countries with the &s;ame Vigor as the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> of <HI>Sidon</HI> and <HI>Tyre</HI> had done before them.</P>

<P>THIS made the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> extend their Con|que&s;ts far beyond what the <HI>Romans</HI> could do by Sea, and gave them infinite Advantages; the improvement of their Navigation was an improve|ment to their Power, and extended their Empire wherever their Ships could come; and in particu|lar they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the I&s;lands of <HI>Sicily</HI> and <HI>Sardinia,</HI> the latter being, as I may &s;ay, at the very Gates of <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>AS this greatne&s;s of the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> by Sea made them formidable to the <HI>Romans,</HI> &s;o it put them upon &s;etting up a Naval &s;trength al&s;o, that they might be able to cope with this rival Com|mon-wealth; and thus Navigation became the darling Study of the two mighty Empires: and tho' it is true that the mutual animo&s;ity propagated the Naval Knowledge no farther than as related to War, and to matching the Power of one another, in order

the Shipping and Navigation of the World made for many Ages, was at tho&s;e places; but even tho&s;e Cities them&s;elves, notwith&s;tanding they employ'd much Shipping, cannot be &s;aid to have added any thing to the knowledge of build|ing Ships, or to the Navigation of the World; but tho&s;e things &s;eemed to &s;tand at a &s;tay, and the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> left the knowledge of the Sea, much where they found it.</P>
<P>SAILING was much the &s;ame, the be&s;t Navi|gators car'd not to go out of &s;ight of Land, and if they did, their Pilots were generally the Stars and Con&s;tellations, &s;uch as the <HI>North Star,</HI> or the <HI>Ur&s;a Major, Ur&s;a Minor,</HI> the <HI>Pleiades, Ca&s;tor</HI> and <HI>Pollux,</HI> and the like; but if they came to thick hazy Wea|ther, that they could not &s;ee the Shoar, and to cloudy Nights, that they could not &s;ee the Moon, or Stars, they were lo&s;t, and at their Wits ends.</P>
<P>AND yet the building of Ships was improv'd much more in this long interval, than the know|ledge of Navigating them; for after the declining and dividing the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, when the Northern Nations began to &s;pread them&s;elves into the Mari|time Countries, the <HI>Gauls</HI> at <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and the <HI>Goths</HI> in <HI>Sweden</HI> began to be &s;trong in Shipping.</P>
<P>AFTER them the <HI>Flemings,</HI> and the <HI>Ea&s;terlings,</HI> as they were afterwards called, were the mo&s;t pow|erful in Trade, and in Shipping al&s;o, of any Na|tion in <HI>Europe,</HI> or in the World: By the <HI>Flemings</HI> here, you mu&s;t under&s;tand the whole <HI>Belgia,</HI> the Subjects afterwards of the Duke of <HI>Burgundy,</HI> con|taining all the Lower <HI>Germany,</HI> and that included the whole &s;eventeen Provinces from the Town and Port of <HI>Mardyke,</HI> between <HI>Dunkirk</HI> and <HI>Calais,</HI> to the Mouth of the <HI>We&s;er,</HI> that is to &s;ay, to the City of <HI>Bremen.</HI></P>

<P>THIS part of the World being thus encrea&s;ing in Ships and Navigation, their power by Sea after|wards, &s;hifted hands al&s;o, and came more into the People, nearer the Mouth of the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and on the <HI>Elb,</HI> &s;uch as to the Cities of <HI>Lubeck</HI> and <HI>Ham|burgh,</HI> the chief of the <HI>Hans Towns,</HI> under the pow|erful &s;upport of the <HI>German</HI> Empire, the <HI>Teutonick Knights</HI> being &s;ubdued: Their other chief Cities were <HI>Bremen, Am&s;terdam,</HI> and <HI>Antwerp,</HI> which with <HI>Stral&s;und, Stetin, Koningsberg,</HI> and <HI>Dantzick,</HI> in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> or Ea&s;tern Sea, made a very powerful Body, and being Cities of great Wealth and Opu|lence in Trade, became al&s;o the patrons of Ship|ping and Navigation, and &s;ometimes &s;truggled with &s;everal powerful Nations.</P>
<P><HI>BRITAIN</HI> all this while had but a &s;mall concern among the navigating World; our greate&s;t foreign Commerce con&s;i&s;ted in exporting three Commodities, <HI>viz.</HI> our <HI>Wooll,</HI> our <HI>Tin,</HI> and our <HI>Lead;</HI> and this was carry'd no farther than to <HI>Ant|werp,</HI> where was the <HI>Staple,</HI> as it was call'd, for our <HI>Engli&s;h Wooll;</HI> which to our &s;hame, and infi|nitely to our lo&s;s, was manufactur'd by the <HI>Flem|ings,</HI> and the Goods when wrought &s;old even back again to us for our Cloathing, from whom the Materials for making them were fir&s;t had.</P>
<P>IN all this Trade, we had but &s;mall u&s;e for Ships, and whereever the Art of Building Ships, or of Sailing in them, was carry'd on, it receiv'd but &s;mall improvement here.

<P>IT's &s;trange what Ships the&s;e were, becau&s;e we know that long before this Shipping was improv'd very much in the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea; however, even there it was but a mean advancement neither, in our e&s;teem, who are come to &s;uch a perfection in the&s;e Days; for tho' the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> and <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and after them the <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Carthaginians</HI> had great numbers of Ships many Ages before the <HI>Goths</HI> and Northern Nations; yet they were not Ve&s;&s;els fit for the Navigation of the&s;e Northern Seas. If now and then a Ve&s;&s;el did come as far as <HI>Britain,</HI> which they did but &s;eldom, they perform'd it with great caution and an infinite trouble, as well

<P>IT is very remarkable too, that when any of tho&s;e early Navigators had made this dreadful Voyage, for &s;uch they thought it to be, I mean the length of <HI>Britain,</HI> they had as much to boa&s;t and bragg of when they came home, as our Sir <HI>Francis Drake</HI> had afterwards, when the ignorant People us'd to &s;ay of him, that he <HI>&s;hot the Gulph,</HI> that is, he went into the Gulph, or Bay of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and that he &s;ail'd round the World; things which are now done every Day, and made as light of as the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> wou'd have made then of &s;ailing from <HI>Tyre</HI> to <HI>Carthage,</HI> or to <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT &s;trange Tales did their old Sailors tell of the terrible I&s;land of <HI>Britain,</HI> and of the <HI>Ultima Thule,</HI> a poor I&s;land among the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> which they dream'd was the <HI>Ely&s;ium,</HI> or dwelling of the Ble&s;&s;ed; a Fable rais'd from the very gro&s;&s;e&s;t of all &s;tupidity and ignorance. <HI>The Ca&s;e was this,</HI> Some of the <HI>Phoenician</HI> Navigators being &s;urpriz'd in the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Chanel with a &s;torm of Wind at South-We&s;t, or perhaps at North-We&s;t (and it may be no extraordinary Storm neither, as we call Storms now) and finding the Sea grow dreadful, and the Waves mount high, frighted to be &s;ure with the danger, and as they were neither by the

goodne&s;s of their Ships, or their Skill in work|ing them, able to bear &s;uch a Sea; they often <HI>turn'd tail to it,</HI> and run away afore the Wind; being driven quite out of their knowledge, per|haps to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland,</HI> or farther to the I&s;lands of <HI>Orkneys,</HI> before they could put in for &s;helter. Many dreadful things (to them <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> and at that time too) befel them, among which, this was one, namely, that as they went farther and farther Northward, they found the Night &s;horten, and the Days of a &s;urprizing length, and growing &s;till longer the farther they went; till at length the Storm abating, and the Sea growing calmer, they put in, I &s;ay, among the I&s;lands of the <HI>Orkneys,</HI> or thereabouts, and here &s;taying for fair Weather they found that the <HI>Sol&s;lice coming on,</HI> there was no Night at all.</P>
<P>SURPRIZ'D with this unaccountable Phaeno|menon, of which their little <HI>A&s;tronomy</HI> cou'd give no account, they concluded, that as by their going &s;o far North they were come to almo&s;t <HI>a continued Day,</HI> if they went a little farther they &s;hou'd come to <HI>everla&s;ting Day,</HI> and that certainly the abode of the Gods lay that way, and the <HI>Elyzium,</HI> or heavenly Man&s;ions, were not far off.</P>
<P>BIG with this Notion, they nam'd one of the I&s;les of <HI>Orcades,</HI> or <HI>Orkneys,</HI> as we now call them, by the name of <HI>Thule,</HI> a Word in the <HI>Phoenician</HI> Language, u&s;ed for the place of Ble&s;&s;edne&s;s, or as &s;ome expound it, the utmo&s;t bound of human Life, and therefore call'd <HI>Ultima Thule.</HI> Had they land|ded upon this fine place they wou'd have had &s;mall occa&s;ion to think it any thing a-kin to the <HI>Elyzium;</HI> for all tho&s;e I&s;lands are mi&s;erably bar|ren, cold, de&s;olate, and the Coa&s;t dangerous: The la&s;t they allowed, as appear'd by this line of <HI>Claudian:</HI></P>

<P>THE improvement then of this particular part, <HI>(viz.)</HI> of early Knowledge and the Art of Building of Ships, is in it &s;elf wonderfully great, and that without any con&s;iderable relation to the Art of Navigation: It is true the well moulding and the &s;hape of the Ve&s;&s;el, as well as the &s;tability of the Building, is much concern'd in the navigating Part, that is to &s;ay in making the Ship &s;ail well, lye near to the Wind, bear the Sea well, and the like; but adds nothing to the Pilot's skill in di|recting the Ship, keeping his Accounts, taking

his Ob&s;ervations; which are quite of a different kind from the Builders Art.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Ships of Burthen that we meet with any account of from Hi&s;tory were tho&s;e of <HI>Tyre,</HI> call'd Ships of <HI>Tar&s;hi&s;h:</HI> The&s;e were coeval in tho&s;e parts of the World to <HI>Nineveh,</HI> as ap|pears by the Story of <HI>Jonah;</HI> and it may be &s;up|pos'd they were con&s;equently improv'd in the time of King <HI>David;</HI> as appears by that ele|gant de&s;cription of a Storm in <HI>P&s;alm</HI> cvii. 23, 26. <HI>They that go down to the Sea in Ships, that do bu&s;ine&s;s in the great Waters. They mount up to the Heaven, they go down again to the depths, their Soul is melted becau&s;e of trouble.</HI></P>
<P>KING <HI>Solomon,</HI> after this, built Ships at <HI>Ezion Gaber,</HI> and &s;ent them to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> certainly to <HI>Ophir,</HI> whereever it was; and it cannot be &s;uppos'd but that they were large Ve&s;&s;els, con&s;idering the time they were out, as well as the length of the Voyage they went; for tho' it may be true that they only coa&s;ted along the Shoar, yet in &s;ome places they might be driven out to Sea a great way, as I have mentioned before in the ca&s;e of the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> in our narrow Seas; and no doubt they were &s;o driven out to Sea very often.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the bigge&s;t of the&s;e Ships, we find, made u&s;e of Oars; and even in <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s time the Ships of War were row'd with Oars; and yet not like the Gallies u&s;ed now in tho&s;e Seas, but very confu&s;edly and irregularly plac'd: nor can the be&s;t Shipwright that I have con|&s;ulted about it, (and I have critically enquir'd) conceive how they could make tho&s;e Ships, as they call'd them, row with three or four banks of Oars, one above another, without making them mo&s;t frightful in &s;hape, and perfectly unfit for all manner of bu&s;ine&s;s; but the Word <HI>Bank</HI> &s;eems to be wrong tran&s;lated.</P>
<P><PB N="52" REF="59">
THE next thing to be ob&s;erv'd is, that we never find any difference in the kinds of the Ships, which they made u&s;e of in tho&s;e Times; but promi&s;cuou&s;ly they are all call'd <HI>Ships,</HI> for what bu&s;ine&s;s, or in what places &s;oever they were made u&s;e of; whether in the narrow Seas, or in the Ocean, whether in Seas, or in Rivers. When <HI>Semiramis</HI> made her famous expedition into <HI>India,</HI> being that part which is now call'd the <HI>Great Mogul</HI>'s Country, &s;he was oppos'd by the <HI>Indians</HI> in the Chanel of the River <HI>Indus,</HI> with four thou&s;and Ships: But as this mu&s;t be even before the building of <HI>Tyre,</HI> or <HI>Sidon,</HI> or at lea&s;t before the former, and con&s;equently before any &s;uch thing as Ships were known in the World; &s;o the mo&s;t we can &s;uppo&s;e of them is, that they were <HI>Canoes,</HI> or which was wor&s;e Boats made of O&s;iers, and Twigs, or Rafts, or &s;ome &s;uch trifling things as above.</P>

They were neither able to bear the mighty Waves, or the furious Storms which the Sai|lors, and the Ships of this Age go thorow, or to &s;ecure the Merchandizes from damage as we do. They had at fir&s;t no Sails, for a long time; no Ma&s;ts, &s;uitable to the burthen of the Ve&s;&s;el; nor for a long time more, any Rigging adapted to the purpo&s;e of Sailing as now it is; in a Word, their Anchors, their Rudders, their Cables, their Shrowds, were all mean and poor, to what we &s;ee now made u&s;e of.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Tyrians,</HI> as I have &s;aid, are call'd the Au|thors of the Navigation of the fir&s;t Ages, and per|haps they were really &s;o, for that part of the World; but that is giving the Honour to a Nation,
<PB N="55" REF="62">
not to a particular Per&s;on; and other Nations might do the like. Some indeed tell us, that the Story of <HI>Daedalus</HI> having made him&s;elf waxen Wings, and flying with his Son <HI>Icarus</HI> from the <HI>Cretan</HI> Labyrinth, is only an allegory, and the meaning was this, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That <HI>Daedalus</HI> having contriv'd a Boat for his e&s;cape out of <HI>Crete,</HI> where he was condemn'd to perpetual Impri&s;onment, put off to Sea in his &s;aid Boat, and being di&s;cover|ed by the <HI>Cretans,</HI> he was per&s;ued by them in other Boats with Oars: That the <HI>Cretan</HI> Boats, having more Oars than <HI>Daedalus,</HI> gain'd upon him and wou'd have infallibly over-taken him, which he fore&s;eeing had provided again&s;t, by the inven|tion of a Ma&s;t and Sail, repre&s;ented in the Fable by Wings made with Feathers fa&s;ten'd together with Wax, by which he flew over the Sea in the Air. This Ma&s;t and Sail being before hand fitted to the Boat, he &s;et up the Ma&s;t in the middle of his Flight, and that being fixt according to Art, he &s;uddenly hoi&s;ted up the Sail al&s;o, fitted to the Ma&s;t; then &s;preading it to the Wind, the Boat went on without the help of their rowing, and that much fa&s;ter than it did before, to the great &s;urprize of his Men: They that per&s;ued him were a&s;toni&s;h'd to find that without making u&s;e of their Oars he flew from them as it were in the Air, and that his Sails were to him as Wings, &s;o that they could by no means over|take him, whereupon they went back and re|ported that <HI>Daedalus</HI> had made him&s;elf Wings: The other part of the Fable is made good al&s;o the &s;ame way; for it &s;eems his Son <HI>Icarus</HI> taught by his Father how to make a Ma&s;t and Sail for his Boat al&s;o, in which he was to attempt, the like E&s;cape; the young Man too eager and de&s;t|rous to &s;ail the &s;wifter, and withal not know|ing &s;o well the nature and rea&s;on of tho&s;e Sails,
<PB N="56" REF="63">
made his too large for the Boat, and hoi&s;ted them &s;o high, that the Wind blowing fre&s;h brought his Ma&s;t by the Board, or if you will, holding too mueh Wind, over-&s;et his Boat; and &s;o he was drown'd in the Sea of <HI>Crete,</HI> which bare his Name for a great while after.</P>
<P>THUS, as the Birds &s;teering their flight in the Air dictated the u&s;e of the Rudder for &s;teering of Ships, or Boats in the Water; &s;o <HI>D$dalus,</HI> by his fertile Brain, invented the flying with Canvas Wings thro' the Seas.</P>
<P>IT is evident that the fir&s;t Sails were made of Skins of Bea&s;ts, &s;tretch'd out upon Poles, and ex|tended with proper fa&s;tnings to either &s;ide of the Boat, like what we call the <HI>Clue</HI> of a Sail; from whence by Ropes fa&s;tned to the Boat, or Ve&s;&s;el, they were &s;o &s;pread as to be made u&s;eful to give motion to the Ve&s;&s;el, or Boat they belong'd to. But it was all at fir&s;t no more than what we call &s;ailing afore the Wind; they knew nothing of <HI>Hauling Clo&s;e, Trimming Sharp,</HI> and <HI>lying near</HI> the Wind, and &s;uch Terms <HI>as we now practi&s;e by;</HI> but when the Wind was contrary, or not large to go a|way <HI>afore it,</HI> they lowr'd the Sail, and took to their Oars, and when they could not go forward by the help of their Oars, all they had for it, was to row in for the Shoar, and put into Harbour whereever they they could find it, and wait there for change of Weather: nor is it to be doubted, as I have ob&s;erved before, but that many Lives were lo&s;t by the common accidents of Wind and Waves before the People arriv'd to skill &s;ufficient to manage their Boats, whether by Sails or by Oars, I &s;ay many Lives were lo&s;t in Ca&s;es where now we find no dangers; for Example, many a Boat over-&s;et for want of knowing how to tend the the Seas, <HI>&s;o our Seamen call it,</HI> to handle their Oars, Steer &s;teady, fill, or not fill, hand, or not
<PB N="57" REF="64">
hand their Sails; in a Word, di&s;tre&s;s, and deliver|ances gave them Experience, and the Experiences added always to their navigating Skill; and thus one Age building upon the Knowledge of the Ge|neration that preceded, they grew every Day abler for the Sea than they were before.</P>
<P>BUT with all this improvement, and with all the encrea&s;e of Knowledge the Antients gain'd in this u&s;eful part of mathematical Knowledge; no|thing ever came &s;o heavily on, or made &s;o dull a progre&s;s as this of Navigation: For at the end of near two thou&s;and Years practice, we find the height of their Improvement amounted to &s;o little, that the meane&s;t of our Mariners can &s;it and je&s;t with it, in the&s;e times, of better skill; making them&s;elves merry with it, as if their Ignorance was as much a wonder to us, as our Knowledge wou'd have been to them, had they been let into it in tho&s;e Days.</P>
<P>HOW do we Read with a kind of a&s;toni&s;hment, and at lea&s;t with contempt, <HI>the little,</HI> which Hi&s;to|ry gives us an account of about the Navigation of the Antients; even of tho&s;e Ages, which compar'd to the antient <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> and <HI>Grecians,</HI> are to be e&s;teem'd as improv'd, and advanc'd in the knowledge of Sea Affairs? How do our Sai|lors je&s;t with the&s;e Nations? How do we call all ignorant Seamen <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Mariners,</HI> alluding to the account given in the 27th of the <HI>Acts, v.</HI> 29. of the Voyage of St. <HI>Paul</HI> from the I&s;le of <HI>Cyprus</HI> to <HI>Malta,</HI> where in their di&s;tre&s;s 'tis &s;aid they ca&s;t four Anchors over the Stern? How do we now ridicule the ignorance of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and of the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> who yet were in tho&s;e Days the skill|fulle&s;t Navigators in the World, for their creeping under the Shores to reach from one Port to ano|ther, and for having no other knowledge of Na|vigation than the bare &s;teering clear of Rocks and
<PB N="58" REF="65">
Sands, when in their view, coming to an Anchor, or running into Harbour every Night, le&s;t they &s;hou'd be lo&s;t in the Dark?</P>
<P>THE truth is, the improvements of the Art of Navigation are extremely Modern, and rather more Modern than that of Building Ships; for till the knowledge of the <HI>Magnet</HI> or <HI>Load&s;tone,</HI> by the power of which, Men can, <HI>as we may &s;ay,</HI> &s;ee in the dark, and find their way by Night as well as by Day, out of &s;ight of Land as well as in &s;ight of Land, in Fogs and Mi&s;ts, as well as out of them; I &s;ay, till then the navigating Skill was but &s;mall: and tho' Men had Ships of good bulk and burthen before, yet they knew little what to do with them when they came into the&s;e boi&s;terous Northern Seas, and out of &s;ight of Land. It is true, they ventur'd boldly, and perhaps more boldly than we do now; and as they grew more and more ex|pert in the knowledge of A&s;tronomy, they made u&s;e of the Con&s;tellations, and heavenly Bodies, to wit, Sun, Moon, Stars, for their guidance, and to &s;hew them their way.</P>
<P>FIRT, we mu&s;t allow them to have had right notions of the &s;ituation of Places, even before they had mea&s;ured the Globe, and divided its Colures or Meridians into Degrees of Latitude and Longi|tude: But when they had &s;o divided the Globe it was ea&s;y then to a&s;certain the di&s;tance of Places from the Equator, or from any given Meridian, &s;o that the Latitude of Places was adju&s;ted by the Geographers with great ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THEN for &s;ailing out of &s;ight of Land, when they did venture to do &s;o, all the help they had was the Po&s;ition of the Northern Con&s;tellations, who&s;e circling Motions round the Pole being pre|&s;crib'd within narrower Limits than tho&s;e more to the Southward, made them be as it were fixt <HI>to them;</HI> &s;o that the <HI>Ur&s;a Major,</HI> or the <HI>Ur&s;a Minor,</HI>
<PB N="59" REF="66">
or the Stars near to them, were as a <HI>Pole Star</HI> to them, becau&s;e they were always to be &s;een within a known and equal di&s;tance from the <HI>Pole Star</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>THESE Stars were their Guides in the Night when they ventur'd into the open Sea, as the Sun was by Day; but their difficulties lay when, in thick, hazy, or dark, and cloudy Weather, they had not the ble&s;&s;ing of Sun, Moon, or Stars, for many Nights and Days together; then they were at a lo&s;s, bewildred, and frighted; and &s;ometimes, <HI>I may &s;ay oftentimes</HI> lo&s;t for want of directions, fall|ing upon Rocks, Lee Shoars, and high Cliffs, or covered Sands, having no knowledge of Places, and no Pilots, Charts, or Plans of Shoars to warn them of the danger; or Rules to judge of the di&s;tances, and to keep account of the Ship's way, as they do now, and &s;o to ca&s;t up where they were, and how far from this or that Shoar, and con&s;equent|ly keep off from danger and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>BUT let us look back to the wi&s;e Navigators of former Ages, well may I &s;ay, that they ven|tur'd boldly; for certainly con&s;idering the &s;mall knowledge they had of the Art it &s;elf, of Sailing, the &s;mall, and few, and in&s;ufficient helps they had for their directions in Ca&s;es of difficulty, it was mo&s;t wonderful that they &s;hould undertake &s;uch Voyages as they did, and yet more &s;trange, that they &s;hould perform them with &s;ucce&s;s when they were undertaken.</P>
<P><HI>FOR Example;</HI> To go back to the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> and <HI>Egyptians,</HI> as &s;mall as their skill was in A&s;tro|nomy, or as few as their Geographical improve|ments were, and as mean as their Ships were, yet we find that they attempted the following Voy|ages, and Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="60" REF="67">
I. THEY coa&s;ted the whole <HI>Mediterranean Sea,</HI> from the bottom of the Straights, as we call it, namely, the Sea of <HI>Phoenicia,</HI> where their two Ports of <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon</HI> &s;tood, to the Point, or Northern Head of the Straights mouth, call'd <HI>Hercules Pillars,</HI> and without unto the Bay where they built the City of <HI>Gades</HI> or <HI>Cades,</HI> which continues a flouri&s;hing City and Port of Trade to this Day.</P>
<P N="2">II. THEY fitted out Ships in the <HI>Red Sea, (viz.)</HI> at <HI>Ezion Geber,</HI> and from thence &s;ail'd to the farthe&s;t part of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies, (viz.)</HI> to the <HI>Aurea Cher&s;onne&s;us,</HI> now call'd <HI>Malacca,</HI> and to the <HI>Philippins;</HI> from whence they brought back the Spices, and Drugs, and other rich Goods of <HI>India,</HI> and returning to the Port, now call'd <HI>Sues</HI> in the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> the Goods were carry'd from thence over Land to <HI>Pelu&s;ium,</HI> or <HI>Damiata,</HI> or el&s;e to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> both of them Ports in the Mouth of the <HI>Nile,</HI> whence again they were carry'd to all the Northern parts of the World by Sea; which Trade continued in the Hands of the <HI>Alexandrians,</HI> and &s;ince that of the <HI>Genoe&s;es,</HI> and &s;ince they lo&s;t it, has been taken up by the <HI>Venetians,</HI> till within a few Ages that the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> found out the way by long-Sea, round the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI></P>
<P N="3">III. THEY &s;ail'd likewi&s;e from the &s;ame <HI>Ezion Geber</HI> to the Coa&s;t of the <HI>African Ethiopia</HI> in the &s;ame <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and from thence following that extended Shoar due South, along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Zanguebar, Mo&s;ambique, Melinda, Monomotapa,</HI> and <HI>Natale,</HI> they doubled the Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> it &s;elf, and &s;eeing the Sun both to the South of them, and to the North of them, and then to
<PB N="61" REF="68">
the South of them again, they pa&s;t along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Congo,</HI> and <HI>Angola,</HI> the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Grain Coa&s;t</HI> of <HI>Guinea;</HI> and continuing an un|wearied Progre&s;s, pa&s;s'd the <HI>Cape Du Verd, Cape Negro,</HI> and <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> till they came to Cape <HI>Spartel,</HI> in the Mouth of the <HI>Straights,</HI> where entring they reach'd their own Colony of <HI>Car|thage,</HI> and thence on to <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> near the place whence they fir&s;t &s;et out.</P>
<P>We are well a&s;&s;ur'd from Authors of good Au|thority that the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> performed all the&s;e Voyages, and in particular the la&s;t; and indeed they were bold Fellows in doing &s;o, con&s;idering that be&s;ides the difficulty of the Coa&s;ts in &s;everal places, it is very probable many of tho&s;e remote Countries were not yet inhabited in tho&s;e early Times, and &s;o &s;oon after the confu&s;ions of <HI>Bahel;</HI> In particular the South, and We&s;t parts of <HI>Africa,</HI> might be &s;uppos'd to be yet unknown, and the po&s;terity of <HI>Canaan,</HI> who fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;t <HI>Egypt,</HI> and &s;pread them&s;elves early, and chiefly along the Shoar of the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> into <HI>Libya,</HI> and that which we now call <HI>Barbary,</HI> and perhaps afterwards into <HI>A|bi&s;&s;inia,</HI> or <HI>Ethiopia,</HI> &s;hou'd be &s;ome Ages before they wandred over the &s;corching Sands of <HI>Zangue|bar</HI> on the Ea&s;t, or the burning Coa&s;ts of <HI>Congo,</HI> and <HI>Angola</HI> on the We&s;t, &s;o to inhabit as far as the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> and the Country of <HI>Monomota|pa;</HI> and if tho&s;e Countries were void of Inhabi|tants, by con&s;equence they would be empty of Pro|vi&s;ions for the relief of the <HI>Phoenician</HI> Seamen, when they &s;hou'd arrivet here.</P>
<P>BUT be that how it will, we are, I &s;ay, a&s;&s;ur'd they did &s;ail that way, and whatever benefit they made of it did frequently put into the Harbours, and Ports upon tho&s;e Coa&s;ts for &s;helter, <HI>at lea&s;t,</HI> if not for relief; nay, one relief we are a&s;&s;ur'd they
<PB N="62" REF="69">
mu&s;t not only often put in for, but go on Shoar to procure, and that is <HI>fre&s;h Water;</HI> nor could they continue long at Sea (in <HI>tho&s;e hot Climates e&s;pecially)</HI> without a frequent &s;upply of it. What skill they were arriv'd to, in making Casks to put and keep Water in, is hard to know; we have &s;ome Rea&s;on to think that earthen Jarrs, and Bottles, were the be&s;t re&s;ervators they had; and of tho&s;e as their Ships could not &s;tow a great many, &s;o nei|ther could they hold any great quantity of Water at a time, &s;o that they mu&s;t go often on Shoar, and into Ports to recruit.</P>
<P>THOSE who under&s;tand this coa&s;ting way of Navigation, and e&s;pecially the dangerous Shoals and Rocks, which lye at the entrance into mo&s;t of the great Harbours and Rivers in the World, know al&s;o, that nothing is more hazardous than to go into &s;ome of tho&s;e Rivers and Harbours without the help of Pilots, and the direction of Boats to &s;ound the depth before them, to find good Ground for Anchor hold, good Riding from Winds, and Currents, &s;o to prevent running on Shoar, and &s;trand|ing on the Beaches and Sands, or &s;taving on the Rocks, upon any &s;tre&s;s of Wind that might blow.</P>
<P>As the dangers were not le&s;s in tho&s;e times, &s;o the advantages and skill which the Navigators had to avoid tho&s;e dangers, were not more or greater than they are now, but a great deal le&s;s; particu|larly for want of Pilots, and of good Anchors, and of Cables, and indeed of good Ships or Ve&s;&s;els; &s;o that all con&s;idered 'tis &s;omething wonderful that &s;uch long and uncertain Voyages could be per|form'd at all.</P>
<P>AGAIN, we are a&s;&s;ur'd that even in tho&s;e Voyages, tho' they coa&s;ted <HI>along Shoar</HI> (as we call it) and kept as much as po&s;&s;ible in &s;ight of Land, yet that they had &s;everal Gulphs to pa&s;s over, and the mouths of great Rivers to cro&s;s in, which
<PB N="63" REF="70">
they mu&s;t needs go out of &s;ight of Land to cro&s;s them, the &s;trength of the Currents not admitting them to go up into tho&s;e Rivers; as the great Ri|ver of <HI>Congo</HI> in the Southern <HI>Guinea,</HI> for Example; and the <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> and <HI>Rio de Senegall,</HI> near <HI>Sier|ra Leon</HI> in the Northern <HI>Guiena;</HI> in &s;ome of which the openings are twelve to &s;ixteen Leagues over, &s;o that they could never &s;ee over from &s;ide to &s;ide; and in &s;uch places if the Weather was thick and hazy, the hazard wou'd be greater than ordinary to tho&s;e Navigators who had no Pilots to direct them, and who knew nothing what they had to expect before them, or how broad tho&s;e openings might be, nay, they could not always know whe|ther there was any Land beyond them or not.</P>
<P>IN like manner tho&s;e Navigators who went to the Ea&s;t, and made that long Voyage from the <HI>Red Sea</HI> to <HI>Ophir</HI> in the <HI>Indies;</HI> e&s;pecially if that <HI>Ophir</HI> be (as we under&s;tand it to be) the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra;</HI> they had many dangerous Apertures which they could not &s;ee over, and mu&s;t venture hard to pa&s;s; as for Example; from the Mouth of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> which we call the Straights of <HI>Babel|mandel,</HI> or as our Seamen call it, the Gulph of <HI>Mo|cha,</HI> they &s;teer'd away Ea&s;t, keeping the Shoar of <HI>Arabia Felix</HI> on the Larbord &s;ide, till they came to the Mouth of the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> It can hardly be &s;uppos'd they went into the bottom of all that Gulph, on the <HI>Arabian</HI> &s;ide, which is above three hundred Miles North up to <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> and then came about again South, on the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> &s;ide to <HI>Gomerou,</HI> and <HI>Ormus.</HI></P>
<P>BUT I will &s;uppo&s;e they had &s;o much know|ledge of the Country as to know that great Inlet call'd the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph, was no more than a Gulph or Inlet, and that they were to cro&s;s over it to the other Shoar, namely, to <HI>Guzeratte,</HI> and then coa&s;t away South along the <HI>Indian</HI> Shore to the
<PB N="64" REF="71">
I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> and round that va&s;t I&s;land into the great Bay of <HI>Bengale;</HI> in doing this al&s;o, they wou'd have a va&s;t opening between the Point call'd <HI>Din Head</HI> or Point <HI>Dant,</HI> being over the mouth of the great River <HI>Indus</HI> to <HI>Surat,</HI> and then again between Cape <HI>Comaroon,</HI> the utmo&s;t Point of the main Land of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon;</HI> the pa&s;&s;age indeed between might be pa&s;&s;able, if their Ve&s;&s;els did not draw much Water, but dan|gerous if they did, and even unpa&s;&s;able as it is now. Again, they wou'd have had a long and dif|ficult &s;tretch from <HI>Point Pedro,</HI> the Northermo&s;t Land on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Ceylon</HI> to <HI>Callimere,</HI> the mo&s;t Southerly point of Land on the Continent of <HI>Coremandell;</HI> from thence &s;uppo&s;ing them to have made the Shoar, they wou'd have a long &s;tretch into the bottom of the Bay, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide, along the Coa&s;t of <HI>Coremondell,</HI> and then another opening with a deep Bay, about twenty five Leagues broad at the mouth, from <HI>Gardeware</HI> to <HI>Pawrarya</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Golconda;</HI> after which coa&s;ting the Bay of <HI>Balla&s;ome,</HI> and the Country of <HI>Bengale,</HI> at the mouth or mouths rather of the great River <HI>Ganges,</HI> they wou'd have the like openings to cro&s;s over, which they could under&s;tand nothing of, un|le&s;s directed by Pilots of the Country, which 'tis doubtful whether they could have at all, or at lea&s;t wou'd very rarely find in tho&s;e early Ages of the World: the cro&s;&s;ing the mouth or rather innu|merable Mouths of the River <HI>Ganges</HI> taking it from the fir&s;t Point North-Ea&s;t of <HI>Pipley</HI> to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Nettingham</HI> or <HI>Bengale Proper,</HI> which is all the bottom of the Bay and is at lea&s;t one hundred Leagues over, is what I can entertain no notion of con&s;idering the people we are talking of.</P>
<P>How then, the&s;e Navigators could pa&s;s all tho&s;e difficult places in &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els, as we have Rea&s;on to believe they &s;ail'd in, and with no bet|ter
<PB N="65" REF="72">
skill in Navigation, than they had at that time, is very hard to judge: That it took them up a very great length of time to coa&s;t all tho&s;e unknown Shoars, and to &s;top, and put in &s;o often, as <HI>no doubt</HI> they were oblig'd to do; this we know, and have &s;poken to already, and this confirms me in the enquiry after the manner of their Sailing; for unle&s;s they had thus coa&s;ted about, how could they be three Years in performing the Voyage? 'Tis certain that our Ships wou'd now go the &s;ame length, that is to &s;ay from the Mouth of the <HI>Red Sea</HI> to the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> and back again in le&s;s than &s;ix Months, or thereabouts, one time with another.</P>
<P>THIS was the State of the World in the infan|cy of Navigation; and &s;o mean a thing was Navi|gation it &s;elf, before they got farther lights, and helps into it. Let us &s;ee how they carry'd on their Affairs in the Di&s;coveries of tho&s;e Days, and what advantageous Improvements they made for Years after this.</P>

<P>IN this &s;ituation, the <HI>Phoenician, [Sidonians]</HI> and <HI>Cilicians,</HI> being the fir&s;t Nations &s;ituated upon the Sea-&s;hores, as I have ob&s;erved already, fir&s;t con|triv'd the building of Boats, and then larger Ve&s;&s;els to float upon the Water; then Ships and other Ve&s;&s;els, <HI>which they call'd Ships,</HI> and then Sails to make u&s;e of the Winds and Seas in tho&s;e Ships, and to guide them from place to place, and this we call Navigation; after the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and after the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> the <HI>Grecians</HI> fell into the &s;ame practice, and thus the Art of Navi|gation was introduc'd in the World.</P>
<P>THE Art being thus obtain'd, or at lea&s;t begun, the U&s;es of it are our next enquiry; and this was in &s;hort of two Kinds.</P>
<P N="1">1. To make and mantain an intercour&s;e or com|munication of Nations by Water, and to bring
<PB N="67" REF="76">
them acquainted with one another, which was the Original of Trade.</P>
<P N="2">II. To &s;eek out new Di&s;coveries, and plant their own people in Colonies, and Settlements in re|mote Countries, which were yet uninhabited, and divided from them by the great Waters, &s;o as they could no otherwi&s;e come to the know|ledge of them, much le&s;s the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and this is the part which comes within the compa&s;s of, and indeed con&s;titutes this Undertaking.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t communication for Commerce, which the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> a People naturally inclin'd to Mer|chandize, were &s;aid to make was with the <HI>Egypti|ans,</HI> who lying on the &s;ame Coa&s;t in the Gulph, or Bottom of the &s;ame Seas, were at fir&s;t ea&s;ily reach'd by the help of &s;mall Boats, and other Ve&s;&s;els, rowing along the Shore; the communication by Land being al&s;o made long before.</P>
<P>IN like manner the <HI>Sidonians</HI> went <HI>North,</HI> and joyn'd their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions to the Sons of <HI>Japhet</HI> in <HI>Syria;</HI> and by the &s;ame Seas &s;oon reach'd the Shores of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> where they built <HI>Tar&s;hi&s;h.</HI></P>
<P><HI>NAVIGATION,</HI> being thus begun in the&s;e three Parts of the World, to wit, <HI>Phoenicia, Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Greece:</HI> We are now to &s;ee what u&s;e they made of it; to what Improvement it guided them, and what Di&s;coveries they made in the World by the help of it; as al&s;o, how the Art it &s;elf, and all the &s;ub&s;equent Branches of Sea know|ledge, which we &s;ee the World &s;ince arrive to &s;uch perfection in, grew up gradually upon the foot of this fir&s;t, and fundamental part of Science.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Di&s;covery the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> made by virtue of their Sea-knowledge, was the I&s;land of <HI>Cyprus;</HI> which tho' they found peopled from the oppo&s;ite Shoar of <HI>Cilicia,</HI> and that there were
<PB N="68" REF="77">
&s;ome few Inhabitants upon it, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ted them|&s;elves, and did as it were but ju&s;t live, and that in a wild and undirected manner, maintaining them&s;elves by the natural product of the Soil, <HI>which was very rich,</HI> yet they were fir&s;t civilized, and taught to live comfortably, and like Men, by the more polite and improv'd <HI>Phoenicians;</HI> who finding the Country fruitful in Corn, Wine, Cat|tle, and e&s;pecially Cotton Wooll, which they &s;oon found the value of, they came over in great Numbers. with their Families, and &s;ettled on the Ea&s;termo&s;t part of the I&s;land: There they built the Towns, or Cities of <HI>Nico&s;ia,</HI> and <HI>Famagu&s;ta,</HI> as they are called now, and in a Word, peopled the whole I&s;land; they built other Towns, no que&s;tion, the I&s;land being full of Towns, but the&s;e are the chief.</P>
<P>HERE the &s;aid <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> People, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> naturally Indu&s;trious, and addicted to Commerce, erected the fir&s;t Woollen Manufactures, which we meet with in any of tho&s;e parts of the World; that is to &s;ay, a Manufacture of <HI>Cotton Wooll,</HI> which in tho&s;e early Times, they brought to great perfection: and afterwards it &s;pread into <HI>Phoenicia</HI> it &s;elf; the Cotton Wooll, which was the Fund for the Manufacture being &s;upply'd from <HI>Cyprus,</HI> where it was the natural growth of the place.</P>
<Q><P>N. B. <HI>This growth of</HI> Cotton Wooll <HI>is &s;till pre|&s;erv'd in the I&s;land of</HI> Cyprus; <HI>and tho' the</HI> Turks, <HI>who are naturally inclin'd to di&s;courage Indu&s;try, and encrea&s;e of People, and of Com|merce, do not carry on much of this Manufacture there, yet the</HI> Cotton Wooll <HI>is carry'd from thence into all the Countries round, and e&s;peci|ally into</HI> France, Italy, <HI>and the</HI> Venetian <HI>Territories; and &s;ome is brought even to</HI> England <HI>it &s;elf, where it is manufactur'd in an extraordi|nary</HI>

<P>ENCOURAG'D by the &s;ucce&s;s of this fir&s;t Di&s;co|very; we find the <HI>Tyrians</HI> or <HI>Phoenicians</HI> afterwards pu&s;hing their good fortune, and planting them|&s;elves in the next place upon the I&s;land of <HI>Crete,</HI> now call'd <HI>Candia;</HI> and here they built <HI>Canea,</HI> and &s;everal other Towns on the Sea-coa&s;t, and peopled them with Inhabitants from their own Country: this, be&s;ides the Concurrence of Hi&s;tory is con|firm'd, in that the <HI>Cretans</HI> not only &s;poke the Language of the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> but al&s;o for that their Cu&s;tomes, and e&s;pecially their <HI>Idols</HI> were for &s;ome Ages the &s;ame.</P>
<P>THE antient Writers of the fir&s;t Ages of the Heathen World, will have <HI>Mercury</HI> to be the fir&s;t Author of Navigation, and that the Wings which the Antients give him in his <HI>Hat,</HI> and his <HI>Heels.,</HI> are Emblems of his teaching Men to fly, that is to <HI>&s;ail</HI> upon the Sea: Others tell us it was invent|ed by the <HI>Egyptian</HI> God <HI>Thoyth,</HI> which is the &s;ame as <HI>Mercury,</HI> and who &s;ome will have to be the an|tient <HI>Termegi&s;tus;</HI> others <HI>Mo&s;es;</HI> That <HI>Danaus</HI> made a Voyage from <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Greece</HI> in a Galley of his own inventing; others that <HI>Edom</HI> or <HI>E&s;au, Jacob</HI>'s elder Brother, having &s;pread his Dominion over the We&s;tern <HI>Arabia</HI> fir&s;t &s;eized the Banks of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and taught his Po&s;terity how to build Ve&s;&s;els, and &s;ail upon the Sea; and that they us'd to rob the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> he him&s;elf commanding them in Per&s;on; &s;o that they make <HI>E&s;au</HI> a great Pirate, even before there were any Ships or Boats to act Piracy with, much le&s;s any to act Piracy again&s;t: All the&s;e things I look upon as Fables of the old Times, and written without any &s;ufficient Au|thority; as I do al&s;o the account of the <HI>Egypti|ans</HI> trading to <HI>India,</HI> and to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Ethiopia,</HI>

<P>TO return therefore to the mo&s;t early times of Navigation, &s;uch as the fir&s;t Di&s;covery of the I&s;lands of <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Candia,</HI> by the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> no doubt the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing tho&s;e two I&s;lands, was a great acce&s;&s;ion of Power to the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> as they rais'd great Tribute from them, and receiv'd great &s;up|plies of Corn from them, which at that time (the Cities of <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon,</HI> being &s;o much encreas'd in People) was very much wanted there.</P>
<P>WE cannot doubt, but that both of tho&s;e I&s;l|ands receiv'd a great addition of People al&s;o from the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> who were all <HI>Canaanites,</HI> when <HI>Jo|&s;uah</HI> at the Head of &s;uch a powerful Army, as that of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> invaded the Land of <HI>Canaan;</HI> and as we can not que&s;tion but that great numbers of People fled away for their Lives upon the fir&s;t Irruption of the <HI>I&s;raelites,</HI> nay even before that Irruption, hearing of their approach, and of their Victorious carrying all before then; on the other &s;ide <HI>Jor|dan;</HI> and e&s;pecially upon the defeat of the Kings, which fir&s;t oppo&s;ed him: I &s;ay we cannot doubt but &s;uch of the People as could flee away with their be&s;t Effects, did go as Nature dictates, and as is the practice in like Ca&s;es to this Day; no doubt but this flight too was with the utmo&s;t precipitati|on, &s;ome one way, &s;ome another; &s;ome over the Mountains of <HI>Libanon,</HI> into the utmo&s;t parts of <HI>Syria,</HI> and towards <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> &s;ome to the Sea-&s;ide to <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon;</HI> and not thinking them&s;elves &s;afe there, they took Shipping again, and went a|way to <HI>Cyprus,</HI> to <HI>Crete,</HI> and to <HI>Italy,</HI> and even any where, <HI>Ubi fata vocant,</HI> wherever they found they could be &s;afe.</P>
<P><PB N="71" REF="80">
THIS we have a proof of by the Pillar &s;aid to be &s;et up upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Barbary,</HI> not far from <HI>Tangier,</HI> which had this In&s;cription,</P>
<Q><HI>We are they who fled from the Face of</HI> JOSUAH <HI>the Robber.</HI></Q>
<P>No wonder then if the Multitudes, who thus fled for their Lives, &s;eated them&s;elves, as I have &s;aid, <HI>among others,</HI> in tho&s;e two large, fruitful, and plea&s;ant I&s;lands of <HI>Cyprus</HI> and <HI>Crete.</HI></P>
<P>To confirm the probability of this, Hi&s;tory a&s;&s;ures us, that at &s;uch time (many Ages after this) when <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> the Great, the &s;ame who &s;ack'd and burnt <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the Temple there, lay'd Seige to the City of <HI>Tyre,</HI> and that the Citizens &s;aw they were not able to beat him off, or to avoid falling into his Hands; they a&s;&s;embled all their Ships together of every &s;ort and &s;ize, and after beating the <HI>Babylonian Fleet,</HI> which block'd them up by Sea, and which tho' it con&s;i&s;ted of three&s;core Ships, the <HI>Tyrians</HI> overthrew with twelve of theirs; I &s;ay, that having thus beaten, and de&s;troy'd the Enemies Ships, they &s;hip'd off all their Riches, and Trea&s;ure, their Goods, and Merchandizes, and every thing that was portable, and &s;ent it over to the I&s;le of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> to their Co|lony there, and then (the Ships returning) they embark'd them&s;elves al&s;o, Men, Women, and Children, and went away after them, even in &s;ight of the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Army; leaving them a naked, empty, and uninhabited City; &s;o that the <HI>Babylo|nians</HI> being di&s;appointed, and enrag'd, turn'd their Army upon <HI>Egypt,</HI> of which the Scripture gives an an account; and Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> &s;ays, God Al|mighty &s;eeing his Servant <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> di&s;ap|pointed of his hop'd for plunder, the reward of his undertaking, and re&s;olving he &s;hou'd not under|take

&s;uch a great Expedition for nothing, made him amends by giving <HI>Pharoah Necho</HI> into his Hands, and giving him the plunder of the great and rich City of <HI>Memphis</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> which he took and de&s;troy'd.</P>
<P>IT is a Que&s;tion in matters of Commerce, whe|ther the de&s;truction of <HI>Tyre,</HI> by <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> did good or hurt. If I may give my opinion, I think it was rather good than harm; for tho' it is true, that the Citizens had a very great lo&s;s in the demoli&s;hing their Hou&s;es, and ruining their pub|lic Edifices; yet as it &s;catter'd a diligent and u&s;e|ful People into divers parts of the World, where they &s;ettled immediately to bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;ome in one place, and &s;ome in another: They were as &s;o many In&s;tructors to the Nations wherever they came, to pur&s;ue the &s;ame Indu&s;try, and maintain them&s;eves by Trade, which before, 'tis very like|ly, they knew little or nothing of.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, as the trading part of the Citizens went off with their Riches, their Mer|chandizes, and all their Wealth, and above all, with their Ships, they were, except the hurry of their Flight, in as good trading Circum&s;tances as before, and &s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed a general Corre&s;pond|ence and Commerce wherever they came.</P>
<P>AND both the&s;e Articles, <HI>(viz.)</HI> their Indu&s;try, and their Wealth was &s;uch a &s;upport to them, that after &s;etting all the People upon bu&s;ine&s;s wherever they came, the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Conqueror was no &s;ooner gone but they return'd to <HI>Tyre,</HI> re-built their City, and in a few Years it became greater, richer, and more powerful than ever it was before.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP.

Al&s;o &s;ome probable account of the fir&s;t peopling of</HI> America, <HI>by the</HI> Carthaginians.</HEAD>
<P>_THAT the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> were the Foun|ders of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> State, and that <HI>Carthage</HI> it &s;elf was originally a Colo|ny of the <HI>Phoenicians;</HI> that it was en|creas'd, and multitudes of People add|ed to it, by the flight of the People from the Land of <HI>Canaan (Phoenicia)</HI> upon the Ir|ruption of the <HI>Hebrews</HI> under <HI>Jo&s;uah;</HI> all this part I think I have clear'd up in the foregoing Chapters.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> and in particular the <HI>Tyrians</HI> and <HI>Sidonians</HI> communicated to tho&s;e of <HI>Carthage</HI> (with their People) the &s;ame trading Ge|nius, which they were &s;o eminent for them&s;elves, is not to be doubted: for the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> &s;oon &s;hew'd the World that they brought with them all the &s;ubtilety of Wit, and Addre&s;s in matters of Commerce; all the indu&s;try and application to

Bu&s;ine&s;s; all the eager de&s;ire to improve in Knowledge, and encrea&s;e in Power, which the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> them&s;elves were &s;o famous for, and particularly, their thir&s;t for Improvement by new Di&s;coveries, planting Colonies, and peopling new Worlds in parts unknown; all this has been toucht at already, and in part de&s;crib'd.</P>
<P>IT cannot be doubted but that all the great Cities and Towns, and e&s;pecially Sea-Ports, of which many remain, and the ruins of many more are to be &s;een on the North Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> from <HI>Tunis,</HI> which was near <HI>Carthage,</HI> if not part of it, to Cape <HI>Spartel,</HI> and thence on the We&s;t Coa&s;t to <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> in the Latitude of fifteen Degrees, and perhaps farther, were originally of <HI>Carthagi|nian</HI> foundation; and that the Commerce &s;ettled in tho&s;e Towns was al&s;o very great and flouri&s;hing during the continuance and pro&s;perity of the <HI>Car|thaginian</HI> Government, who went on with great Succe&s;s, and a high Hand, extending their po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ions in <HI>Africa</HI> to &s;uch a length, as no &s;ucceeding Powers have thought fit to meddle with after them, and no doubt but they found an infinite ad|vantage of Wealth from them, as may be judg'd by what &s;till appears.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Carthaginian Empire</HI> was over|thrown by the <HI>Roman</HI> in the la&s;t Punick War, and the City of <HI>Carthage</HI> it &s;elf de&s;troy'd, all the reading part of Mankind very well know; and it is none of the bu&s;ine&s;s of this Undertaking to enter into any account of it; but thus far is ne|ce&s;&s;ary to our pre&s;ent purpo&s;e to ob&s;erve, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That tho' the <HI>Romans</HI> were great encouragers of Learning, and of Arts and Science, as in particu|lar of Eloquence, of Poetry, and many u&s;eful and civilizing parts of Knowledge; having the greate&s;t Poets, and Orators, and State&s;men, and Generals, flouri&s;hing under the protection of their Govern|ment,

that ever the World &s;aw; yet their Ge|nius did not lye to Trade, to di&s;covery of foreign Countries, or &s;ettling Colonies for Commerce, in new-found and remote Places; nor did they en|courage Navigation and Plantation, or erect Ma|nufactures, for the ends of Trade, as the <HI>Carthagi|nians,</HI> and <HI>Phoenicians</HI> had done before them.</P>
<P>FROM hence it follow'd, that with the fall of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> and <HI>Phoenician</HI> States, all the mo&s;t promi&s;ing and pro&s;perous Di&s;coveries they had made &s;unk back again towards their original Ob&s;curity: The People, who had been &s;ettled in them, not receiving &s;upplies from their Government, or from their private Corre&s;pondents in <HI>Carthage,</HI> as they u&s;ually had done, and as was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;upport the Plantations they had begun, either &s;tarv'd or peri&s;h'd for want, or were oblig'd to abandon the Settlements they had made; a thing we may almo&s;t remember to have been the fate of &s;everal of the fir&s;t Planters in the Northern <HI>America,</HI> even by our own Nation, tho' no pub|lic calamity at home prevented a Supply; as par|ticularly at <HI>New England, Virginia, Bermudas, Da|rien,</HI> and &s;everal other Plantations, in tho&s;e parts of the World.</P>

<P>BUT before I leave this part I crave leave to mention one thing, which may at lea&s;t be divert|ing, if not po&s;itive enough to claim its being in|&s;tructing, in a ca&s;e which has been the occa&s;ion of much di&s;pute among the Learned Geographers and Hi&s;torians, as well of the pre&s;ent, as of the pa&s;t Ages; and which is &s;till not le&s;s doubtful and undetermined; namely, How, and when the great Continent of <HI>America</HI> came to be peopled with Inhabitants, and from whence? A difficulty which has been thought &s;o great, that &s;ome, and tho&s;e not among the ignorant part of Mankind neither, would have us put God Almighty to the Repetition of a particular Creation of the Species, both of Man and Bea&s;t, for the &s;upplying that part of the World, and which they think it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;hou'd be done any other way.</P>
<P>NOW, tho' I &s;hall in the pur&s;uit of this under|taking &s;hew how ea&s;y it might have been for all the kinds of living Creatures which were found in <HI>America,</HI> except Man, to arrive there without the help of Navigation, much more without the ne|ce&s;&s;ity of a Creation; &s;o I cannot quit this part without taking notice how ea&s;ily it might be, and how rational it is to believe it was peopled by the help of Navigation from the We&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Africa;</HI> and how probable, that it was &s;o done at that time, e&s;pecially when the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t that Coa&s;t; a People wholly addicted to &s;earch after new Di&s;coveries, and boldly venturing into all parts of the World for them; as al&s;o furni&s;hed with Shipping able and &s;ufficient to perform &s;uch

Voyages, tho' not &s;o well qualified with skill to guide them; which want of skill was however not &s;uch as to render it impo&s;&s;ible to perform the Voy|age, and at lea&s;t to make the Di&s;covery whether it was &s;ufficient to return from thence or no: Nay the very want of skill, for ought we know, might be the occa&s;ion of the Di&s;coveries, when &s;ome of tho&s;e Navigators being by the accident of Winds, or Storms driven off to Sea from <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> or the I&s;lands lying off from the <HI>Cape,</HI> and running away We&s;t out of their knowledge by the force of the Weather till they came in the way of the Trade Winds and the Current which &s;ets in towards the Coa&s;t of <HI>America,</HI> where they wou'd in fifteen or twenty Days, &s;uppo&s;ing a &s;trong gale of Wind, get &s;ight of Cape St. <HI>Augu&s;tine,</HI> in the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> or of &s;ome of the <HI>We&s;t-Indian</HI> I&s;lands, &s;uch as <HI>Barba|does,</HI> or <HI>Nevis,</HI> or <HI>Tobago,</HI> or others in the like &s;i|tuation: Nor was this &s;o improbable, much le&s;s impracticable, as &s;ome wou'd in&s;inuate.

but that the Inhabitants mu&s;t have found the way over the Northermo&s;t points of Land, or in <HI>Europe</HI> over the Frozen Seas, from the Continent of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> which being yet undi&s;covered, mu&s;t be &s;uppos'd to joyn &s;ome where in the extreme parts.</P>
<P>BUT as this is building all upon &s;ugge&s;ted po&s;|&s;ibilities, where all that has yet been di&s;covered appears frightfully impracticable, and that it is evident all that part of the World is, at this time, utterly uninhabited, and we have great rea&s;on to believe, that it never was otherwi&s;e; &s;o the pa&s;|&s;age for Mankind, that way &s;eems to me to be ab&s;urd, &s;o much as to rea&s;on upon, and is apparent|ly impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, the pa&s;&s;age by Sea, as it has appear'd &s;ince, to be very ea&s;y, &s;o there is no room to doubt, but it was then not only practicable, but was really performed; and this I &s;hall endea|vour to make very clear, at lea&s;t very rea&s;onable, when I come to it again, which will be pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>BUT before I run too far from home, and that I may take every thing with me as I go, that the Reader may not lo&s;e the remembrance of things, I mu&s;t go back again to <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Sidon</HI> where I &s;et out, and &s;peak of the knowledge in Arts, as well as Trade.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Phoenicians</HI> werenot only the Patrons of Commerce, and &s;et Trade fir&s;t on Foot in the World; but they were, at lea&s;t, encouragers, (if not the originals) of Arts and Sciences, and the fir&s;t &s;preaders of univer&s;al Knowledge in the World.</P>
<P>IT is true we give the honour of A&s;tronomical Studies, and all the <HI>Promethean</HI> Fire, which in|flamed the brea&s;ts of Men with the mo&s;t early de|&s;ire of Knowledge, to the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Chaldaeans;</HI> the&s;e were the Wi&s;e-men called &s;o by way of di|&s;tinction from all the re&s;t of the World: But it will appear then that the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> were the <HI>Eng|li&s;hmen</HI> of that Age, that is to &s;ay, if they were not

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII. <HI>Of the</HI> Phoenicians <HI>being early improvers of Learning, as well as of Commerce and Naviga|tion, and particularly of their Prince</HI> Cadmus <HI>introducing the knowledge of Letters into</HI> Greece.</HEAD>
<P>TO the honour of the <HI>Phoenician</HI> Age, it mu&s;t be acknowledged, that however for righteous Ends, and with ju&s;t Rea&s;ons, to us unknown, Hea|ven thought fit at la&s;t to overthrow them; yet while they remain'd a People, they were patterns of all commendable Virtues; particularly &s;uch as tended to the e&s;tabli&s;hing Nations, encrea&s;ing the Felicity of Mankind, peopling de&s;olate Countries, and furni&s;hing the Nations they planted with all things both needful and plea&s;ant for Life.</P>
<P>THIS Corre&s;pondence of People not only a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed in &s;preading Inhabitants into remote parts of the World, and &s;o obeying the Directions their Maker gave them at fir&s;t, namely, <HI>to repleni&s;h the Earth;</HI> but that Corre&s;pondence nece&s;&s;arily begat Trade, Trade begat Navigation, Navigation by making Di&s;coveries, begat Plantation, and remote Plantations again encreas'd Corre&s;pondence: Thus every improveing quality circulated through the World, and the whole Globe &s;eems now to be brought into a kind of general acquaintance with

it &s;elf, the remote&s;t Nations conver&s;e, the People know one another, nay, I may &s;ay, continually talk with one another, by Mi&s;&s;ives, by Me&s;&s;en|gers, and by Corre&s;pondencies of all &s;orts.</P>
<P>TRADE is certainly a Patron of Arts, as it is the Mother of Indu&s;try; Commerce is naturally an encourager of Learning, and has by its Cor|re&s;pondence been the greate&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance to human Knowledge.</P>
<P>HOW has Trade pickt up all the mo&s;t u&s;eful Drugs in every part of the World for the &s;upply of Phy&s;ic, and for the help and health of Mankind? Do we not &s;ee the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> fetch'd from the mo&s;t remote parts of the World? Is not every <HI>Drugi&s;t</HI>'s or <HI>Apothecarie</HI>'s Shop furni&s;h'd from both the <HI>Indies,</HI> and almo&s;t from both the <HI>Poles?</HI> It wou'd take up more room in this Work than 'tis po&s;&s;ible to &s;pare to di&s;cour&s;e fully of this one Ar|ticle; and yet 'twou'd be unju&s;t to omit taking notice how every new Di&s;covery, every Plantati|on, every new branch of Trade, furni&s;hes &s;ome new Thing, &s;ome Rarity in Nature, &s;ome Speci|fic in Phy&s;ic for the relief of a di&s;temper'd World.</P>
<P><HI>FOR Example:</HI> How many choice Plants and Drugs did the di&s;covery of <HI>America</HI> furni&s;h this part of the World with, of which they knew nothing be|fore? What poor weak Tools had our be&s;t Phy&s;ici|ans to work with, in ca&s;e of Agues, and all inter|mitting periodical Fevers? How did the Ague &s;o ma&s;ter the utmo&s;t skill of Phy&s;ic, that for &s;ome Ages it pa&s;t for a po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Devil,</HI> till <HI>Ame|rica</HI> furni&s;h'd the true and only Exorci&s;t the BARK, a Sovereign, a Specific, a neverfailing Medicine.</P>

<P>THE <HI>Sugar-Cane,</HI> was a Di&s;covery, as to <HI>Europe,</HI> of the &s;ame date; for tho' 'tis thought they knew the u&s;e of it in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies</HI> before, 'tis certain we knew nothing of it on this &s;ide the <HI>Mediter|ranean Sea</HI> till it was brought to us from <HI>America.</HI></P>

<P>All the&s;e Di&s;coveries are familiariz'd to us by Trade, and that Trade made practicable to us by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Navigation; both which, as above, we owe in their Beginnings, and fir&s;t Improve|ment, to the Indu&s;try and Application of the <HI>Phoenicians,</HI> and particularly the People of <HI>Sidon</HI> and <HI>Tyre,</HI> and the parts adjacent.</P>
<P>BUT this was not all: As they began with Com|merce and Navigation, &s;o, as Commerce is a friend to all Improvement, and the Wealth which they gain'd by their Commerce encouraging them in the &s;earch after Knowledge, they became al&s;o great Patrons of Learning; and joining to them the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> who taking them as Nations, were but the elder Branch or Brothers by Race to the <HI>Phoe|nicians:</HI> As <HI>Canaan</HI> was the Son of <HI>Ham</HI> or <HI>Cham,</HI> &s;o <HI>Chus</HI> was al&s;o his Son, and &s;o were <HI>Mizraim,</HI>

<P>THIS &s;hort piece of Chronology, <HI>which I &s;hall trouble you with no more of,</HI> was nece&s;&s;ary here to &s;hew, that tho' Science had its fir&s;t Introduction in the more remote parts of the World, among the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> and <HI>Arabians,</HI> and then as far back as <HI>Atlas</HI> and <HI>Prometheus,</HI> and that the <HI>Magi</HI> or <HI>Wi&s;e|men,</HI> &s;o call'd for di&s;tinction, and the <HI>South-Sayers</HI> were fir&s;t found in tho&s;e Parts; yet that the <HI>Phoe|nicians</HI> and <HI>Egyptians</HI> were the mo&s;t fam'd improvers of all their Knowledge. The Great <HI>Prometheus,</HI> they tell us, fir&s;t &s;tudyed A&s;tronomy, and made his fir&s;t Ob&s;ervations upon Mount <HI>Cauca&s;us</HI> in <HI>Me|dia,</HI> and the Ea&s;tern parts of <HI>Chaldea;</HI> from whence he is fabled to be chain'd down to that Mountain, with a Vulture eating out his Bowels; which is on|ly an allegory or invention, &s;ignifying, that he was eaten up or con&s;um'd with an eager de&s;ire after Knowledge, and that he tyed him&s;elf down &s;o a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to his nightly Ob&s;ervations of the Stars lying on his Back on the Ground, many Nights together, on the Summits of tho&s;e Hills, till by the &s;everities of the heat and cold, Vapours of the Night, and other inclemencies of the Sea&s;on, he contracted a Di&s;ea&s;e which eat out his Vitals, and de&s;troy'd him; thus <HI>Atlas</HI> his Brother is &s;aid to &s;upport the Globe upon his Shoulders, and is painted with that heavy load upon his Back, intimating by way of Fable, that by his great knowledge of A|&s;tronomy, and his great Wi&s;dom, he directed all human Government, and the Affairs of greate&s;t import in the World.</P>
<P>BUT if <HI>Prometheus,</HI> a <HI>Chaldean,</HI> fir&s;t by his &s;tu|dy of A&s;tronomy communicated Wi&s;dom to the World; <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> an <HI>Egyptian,</HI> improved upon his

Studies, and gave us the fir&s;t Sy&s;tem of that Sci|ence which prevail'd in the World for above 2000 Years, till in the&s;e latter Ages of Wi&s;dom, that Knowledge is yet father extended, and the new Philo&s;ophy has prevail'd upon it; the <HI>Copernican</HI> Sy&s;tem being found more con&s;i&s;tent with it &s;elf, and with the re&s;t of Nature.</P>
<P>THIS is that <HI>Prometheus</HI> to whom the antient Athei&s;ts wou'd, if po&s;&s;ible, have a&s;cribed &s;ome of their Maker's Honour in creating Man: The Sto|ry is worth noting, to &s;hew how much wi&s;er the antient Heathens were than the Athei&s;tic part of Mankind, of what Age &s;oever; the Fiction pre|tends, That <HI>Prometheus</HI> making the figure of a Man in Clay, &s;tole Fire from the Sun to envigorate the lump, and &s;o gave it motion: The meaning was hone&s;tly this, That before <HI>Prometheus</HI> Mankind was little better than a lump of Earth, &s;o gro&s;ly Ignorant, Bruti&s;h, and Stupid, that he had no|thing of &s;upernatural Knowledge in him; but that he, by the &s;tudy of the heavenly Bodies, in&s;pir'd the Minds of Men with Divine Wi&s;dom, and the knowledge of the true God. Thus far the Moral of the Fable is good, but as afterwards carryed on it ro&s;e up to an Ab&s;urdity, by that &s;ort of People, who wou'd have it that Man made him&s;elf without any Original, or fir&s;t moving Cau&s;e; on which occa&s;ion take the following &s;hort reply.</P>

AS thus the <HI>Egyptians</HI> had their <HI>Tri&s;megi&s;tus,</HI> and their <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> who improv'd upon <HI>Atlas</HI> and <HI>Pro|metheus,</HI> and encreas'd the Knowledge and Under|&s;tanding of the Ages which follow'd: So the <HI>Phoe|nicians,</HI> not confining them&s;elves to Trade and Na|vigation, had their <HI>Cadmus,</HI> to who&s;e Wit and In|vention, they to this Day, tho' wrongfully, a&s;cribe the invention of Letters; I &s;ay wrongfully becau&s;e I think it is clear that the fir&s;t knowledge of Letters was from Heaven it &s;elf, and that imme|diately by the Finger of God writing the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Law, which we call the Decalogue or Ten Com|mandments, and putting it into the Hand of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> to teach the <HI>Hebrews.</HI> It is ea&s;y to bring back all the knowledge of Letters, the giving Sounds to Figures, and marks, join'd by Prolation into Words, to this great Original, and to prove that both the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Phoenicians</HI> had no other knowledge of Litterature, but what deriv'd from this &s;olemn Beginning.</P>
<P>BUT not to dwell upon that here, which I may have an occa&s;ion al&s;o to mention again: I do not by this at all le&s;&s;en the Honour of <HI>Cadmus</HI> that learned Prince; for he was both Prince and Scholar; and tho' he did not invent the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Alphabet, or the fir&s;t way of u&s;ing Letters, and impre&s;&s;ing Letters and Words for Speech, and Writing; yet he, as above, greatly improv'd Knowledge. I will not make <HI>Cadmus</HI> the Improver, and God the Inventor, for 'tis evident the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Language was &s;o per|fect in its Original, that it has &s;uffer'd the lea&s;t alteration of its Orthography of any Lan|guage in the World; nay, we are not &s;ure that it has &s;uffer'd any alteration at all; and the <HI>Jews</HI> tell you, that all the pretended Improve|ments, which &s;ome &s;peak of, are only advances to|wards a re&s;toring it to its heavenly and original

<P>BUT, I &s;ay not this to le&s;&s;en the Honour of <HI>Cad|mus,</HI> that learned and ingenious Prince of <HI>Tyre,</HI> tho' he did not bring the knowledge of Letters into the World; yet this he did, he invented a new way of writing tho&s;e Letters, and form'd a new Alphabet of his own: This new way differ'd from the <HI>He|brew</HI> in this great and &s;ignificant Article, namely, (1) That as the <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and from the <HI>Hebrew</HI> all the other Languages, at that time in u&s;e, Read from the right Hand to the left; he inverted the Order, and wrote from the left Hand to the right. (2) As the <HI>Hebrew</HI> Alphabet was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a great number of Points and Marks, by which the &s;ame Letters had their differing Pronunciation and dif|fering Signification, he form'd a new Alphabet of &s;imple Letters, with very few Marks or Points, but with one &s;mall da&s;h call'd <HI>Accent</HI> to a&s;&s;ign the Empha&s;is of Pronouncation, to this or that particu|lar Vowel.</P>
<P>THESE Letters he call'd <HI>Alphabeta</HI> from the two fir&s;t Letters <HI>Alpha</HI> and <HI>Beta,</HI> as we call our Alpha|bet, in our vulgar Speech, to this Day, by the Name of the <HI>A B C,</HI> making a Word or proper Name of tho&s;e Letters, importing the re&s;t; &s;o we &s;ay of an ignorant Fellow, let him go learn his <HI>A B C,</HI> that is the Book, where the knowledge of the Let|ters are fir&s;t learn'd, and where the Alphabet or <HI>A B C</HI> is placed at the beginning.</P>

As for the <HI>Sea</HI> of Bra&s;s, it might well be call'd a Sea indeed, for it held above 125 Ton of Water, in one &s;olid Ve&s;&s;el of Bra&s;s: Then the two Columns of Bra&s;s, which the &s;ame Arti&s;t ca&s;t, being &s;olid Bra&s;s, forty Cubits, that is, three&s;core Foot high, and with the Flowers, and Chain-work round them, were twelve Cubits, that is, three Fathom about.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame Workmen was, it &s;eems, by the &s;ame Text, an admirable Arti&s;t at Engraving, and a worker in Gold, and Silver, and Purple,

and Blue; by which I under&s;tand, either an extraordinary Embroiderer, or a Weaver of flower'd Silks, mixt with Gold and Silver; all which Arts, it &s;eems, he had been brought up and was arriv'd to a perfection in at <HI>Tyre.</HI> So that the encouragement given to Arts, by the occa&s;ion of their Trade was apparently very great; nor do we read of any thing done a|mong the <HI>Romans</HI> that comes near it, tho' Arts might be &s;aid to flouri&s;h very much too in their Time.</P>
<P>FROM hence I mu&s;t take the liberty to note, that upon the De&s;truction of this diligent People, and afterwards of their Po&s;terity the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> (who were alike indu&s;trious) their skill in tho&s;e things dyed with them; the know|ledge in tho&s;e more exqui&s;ite Arts peri&s;h'd with them; the <HI>Romans</HI> that &s;ucceeded the <HI>Carthagi|nians</HI> made nothing of it; they civiliz'd the Manners indeed of &s;ome of the Nations, whom they conquer'd; but they did not encourage Arts and Sciences like the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> or propa|gate Trade and Navigation like the <HI>Carthagini|ans:</HI> and therefore we find no &s;uch Arti&s;ts a|mong the <HI>Romans,</HI> as tho&s;e of <HI>Tyre</HI> appear to have been, or indeed as the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> and as the <HI>Carthaginians.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> indeed were good Architects, but it was in the latter part of their Empire, and be&s;ides they had all their orders of Building from the <HI>Graecians,</HI> as the <HI>Dorick,</HI> the <HI>Corinthian,</HI> the <HI>Attick,</HI> all <HI>Grecian.</HI> The mo&s;t fa|mous Ma&s;ters of Sculpture and Painting, were <HI>Graecians;</HI> the Gladiators indeed, and the Fencers, the Great Generals, and Officers, were <HI>Romans;</HI> in the Fighting part they out-did the whole World; but the Arts of Peace were not their Province.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="101">
THE great Image of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> the King of <HI>Babylon,</HI> the great Colo&s;s at <HI>Rhodes;</HI> the&s;e were all perform'd in latter Times, tho' by the &s;ame Race of Arti&s;ts; but we &s;ee nothing of it among the Arti&s;ts of our Age.</P>
<P>SOME have &s;aid that <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s Image of Gold, was Ca&s;t by a <HI>Tyrian</HI> Engineer, whom he took Pri&s;oner at the time he be&s;ieg'd <HI>Tyre,</HI> of which I have &s;poken before; and the Gold, which mu&s;t be of an immen&s;e Value, was made up out of the plunder of the Cities of <HI>Egypt,</HI> which he conquer'd after his di&s;appointment at the Seige of <HI>Tyre;</HI> for there, tho' he he took the City, he got no plunder, &s;ince the Inhabi|tants &s;hip'd them&s;elves off, while he lay under their Walls, and left him to take what he could find, as you have heard.</P>
<P>BUT as God gave him <HI>Egypt</HI> for his Wages, as the Text &s;ays, there he made him&s;elf full amends, and got an infinite Trea&s;ure; with which, if that part of the Story be true, and perhaps with the plunder of God's Temple and City al&s;o, he ca&s;t this mon&s;trous Image, which he &s;et up in the Plains of <HI>Dura,</HI> without the City; the height of it was &s;ixty Cubits, that is, ninety Foot, which is within eleven Foot, half as high as the Monument; the breadth only nine Foot; how thick is not &s;et down; and this Image was of Ma&s;&s;y Gold.</P>
<P>IT is not very hard to ca&s;t up the weight of the Gold, reckoning every inch Square and So|lid to be four Ounces, as no doubt it wou'd, and every five Ounces to be worth twenty Pounds Sterling, according to the pre&s;ent Stand|ard of Gold, which is four Pounds per Ounce.</P>
<P>IF the Arti&s;t, which Ca&s;t this Image, was an Inhabitant of <HI>Tyre,</HI> as is not improbable; this is the u&s;e I make of it, namely, that the
<PB N="92" REF="102">
<HI>Phoenicians</HI> were (even then) great improvers of Art, and great encouragers of it al&s;o; and I with great certainty venture to &s;ay, that it was all a con&s;equence of their being great improvers of Commerce; for Trade thriving, Arts always flouri&s;h; Commerce is a friend to Learning; Trade makes the People rich, and their Wealth puts them upon improvement of Arts and Sci|ences; Riches reward Application, and encou|rage Ingenuity; Money, where there is a Genius in|&s;pires the Mind, and gives plea&s;ing Repre&s;enta|tions of an encrea&s;e of Gain, and e&s;pecially where Wealth is gotten by Trade, it pu&s;hes on the Mind for more Trade.</P>
<P>NOTHING makes Arts and Sciences thrive more than their working on a public Pur&s;e; no private Man can reward as the public can; and Kings therefore are applauded as the en|couragers of Learning, becau&s;e they can, and very often do bountifully reward Learned Men, Men of Genius, and of Application.</P>
<P>LET us then take the <HI>Tyrians,</HI> and the <HI>Egyp|tians,</HI> for they were contemporary: I &s;ay, let us take them in the early times of the World before the Conque&s;ts of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar;</HI> and while they were flouri&s;hing in Wealth by Com|merce, as they both were at that time; you will al&s;o find that they were famous for Wi&s;|dom and Learning, for Knowledge and Under|&s;tanding; and that they had always very great Men flouri&s;hing among them; I mean great for Learning, and for encouraging of Learn|ing of every kind, and e&s;pecially in A&s;trono|my, in Philo&s;ophy, and in all the other parts of u&s;eful Knowledge.</P>
<P>IT is true, Learning was then under&s;tood to mean the &s;ame thing which we under&s;tand by it now; the Study in their Schools was not
<PB N="93" REF="103">
Books, but their School-Ma&s;ters read them the Precepts of Antient and Wi&s;e-men, and deli|ver'd them in Philo&s;ophic and Wi&s;e Di&s;cour&s;es, not in Writings or hi&s;torical Narrations of their own.</P>
<P>AMONG the&s;e, they had the Precepts of <HI>Noah,</HI> which contained, as the Learned &s;ay, twelve Sentences for the Government of Life; and for the guiding them&s;elves in the various Scenes Men were ordinarily &s;uppos'd to pa&s;s through: The&s;e Precepts, like the Ten Commandments, were &s;aid to contain, fir&s;t, Directions for God's Wor&s;hip; and next, The Laws of Right and Wrong, or Rules of Morality; but we never find they were committed to Writing.</P>
<P>THE teachings in the Schools contained Wi&s;e Comments upon that great Text, which however the Teachers them&s;elves did not &s;tick clo&s;e to, as to Religion; the Polythei&s;m of the Nations pre&s;ently breaking in, yet the Moral Duties took place, and the Philo&s;ophers obtain'd that Name; for being Lovers of Wi&s;dom, and Teach|ers of Knowledge, in&s;tructing the Youth of the World, as in Wi&s;dom and Knowledge, &s;o al&s;o in Virtue and Piety.</P>
<P>FROM that fir&s;t or great Cla&s;s, in which, I &s;ay, the Precepts of Virtue were in&s;till'd into the Minds of their Scholars, they proceeded to in&s;truct them in the principles of Philo&s;ophy, as well Natural as Experimental; but how far they went at that time, we can make no judg|ment; &s;ome are of the opinion, that they went beyond us all, that they had a greater know|ledge in many things than ever we arriv'd to &s;ince. A <HI>French</HI> Writer, who&s;e Name I cannot now recollect, tells us, That above 2000 Years ago, and long before <HI>Hippocrates,</HI> or even <HI>Ae&s;cula|pius</HI> him&s;elf, they had a way, with &s;afety, to

cut for the Stone in the Kidnies, which the greate&s;t Arti&s;ts in Surgery, and the greate&s;t Anatomi&s;ts tell us now, is impracticable; as al&s;o, that they had &s;everal Medicines which wou'd break or di&s;&s;olve the Stone in the Blad|der; that they perfectly under&s;tood the Circu|lation of the Blood (as indeed 'tis evident <HI>So|lomon</HI> did) <HI>Eccle&s;.</HI> xii. 6. where the Wheel at the Ci&s;tern, and the Buckets at the Well, are clear References to the &s;top of the Circulation.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e things are true, as I mu&s;t confe&s;s is more than probable, what a blow to the learned World was the growing Conque&s;t of the <HI>Romans?</HI> Nay rather, what injury to the general Improve|ment of Mankind, has Pride, and the Ambition of Men, as well States and Governments, as Kings and Princes, been in the World? who by intro|ducing Wars and Deva&s;tations, and by inhuman bloody Mea&s;ures brought De&s;olation upon flouri&s;hing Nations; and have as at one blow, over|thrown all the learned Improvements, all the wi&s;dom and knowledge of Arts, and of u&s;eful Inventions in the Countries they have Con|quered?</P>
<P>HOW many Ma&s;ters of Science, how many Teachers and In&s;tructors in u&s;eful Arts did <HI>A|lexander</HI> the Great, notwith&s;tanding his being a lover of learned Men, bury in the Ruins of that great City <HI>Tyre;</HI> and in the bloody Re|venge which he took of the Citizens? of whom he put 26000 to Death, by way of cold Blood Ma&s;&s;acre? How many flouri&s;hing Merchants, their Wealth being plundered, their Wives and Children murther'd, and their Ships burnt and de&s;troy'd, did he hang upon the Sea-&s;hore on Gibbets, in a line of &s;ix Miles in length; and as the famous Mathematician <HI>Archimedes</HI> was kill'd in the &s;acking of the City of <HI>Syracu&s;e,</HI> in the

<P>WHAT a noble Trade might we in the&s;e I&s;lands have by this time carry'd on with the Coa&s;t of <HI>Afric,</HI> if there were 3000 populous Cities upon the Coa&s;t of it, as was the ca&s;e in tho&s;e Days? whereof one, namely, <HI>Carthage</HI> had 700,000 People in it, and were Ma&s;ters of an immen&s;e Wealth, when the <HI>Barbary</HI> Coa&s;t was populous like <HI>France,</HI> and carry'd on a prodi|gious Trade with all the known World?</P>
<P>LET us but imagine <HI>Africa</HI> peopled now as it was in tho&s;e Times, when the <HI>Numidians</HI> and <HI>Mauritanians</HI> were a People &s;uppos'd to have each two Millions in Number, and inhabited all the Plains of <HI>Barca,</HI> the fruitful Fields of <HI>Zagaon,</HI> and <HI>Tebe&s;ea,</HI> and of <HI>Teme&s;na</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Fez,</HI> places, now left de&s;olated, and almo&s;t uninhabited; when be&s;ides <HI>Carthage,</HI> which was the Emporium, the City of <HI>Utica</HI> contain'd 100,000 People; the Cities of <HI>Tingis,</HI> of <HI>Portus Magnus,</HI> and of <HI>Ta|am&s;iga,</HI> each as many, when the Lands were cul|tivated; the Corn, Cattle, Wines, Olives, and other product of the Earth con&s;um'd upon good Terms at home; and the Copper and Bra&s;s, Iron, Allom, Almonds, Rai&s;ins, Silver, Gold, Wax, Ho|ney, Leather, Skins of Bea&s;ts, Hor&s;es, Gums, and Drugs, which were produc'd by the Country, all along the Coa&s;t, &s;upply'd all the re&s;t of the known World as Merchandize for Exportation, and brought the Merchants in return the Product and Manufactures of all the Countries to which they traded.</P>

ADD to all this, That the People of this va&s;t Empire were not as the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Turks,</HI> who &s;ucceeded them, are now; an indolent rapa|cious Crew of Vagrants and Thieves, who nei|ther have Trade, or &s;eek any; who cultivate no Lands, but for immediate Food; who have nei|ther Numbers to con&s;ume the Product of a fruit|ful Soil; Merchants to export it to other Coun|tries, or People to rai&s;e a product for the Con|&s;umption which might be demanded.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco;</HI> What are they, for encouraging Nations to trade with them?

Being a People accu&s;tomed to Cruelty and Robbery. They keep Faith neither with God or the De|vil; they range the Seas for Plunder, and live upon the Spoil of Mankind, and of whom it may be &s;aid, 'tis the &s;hame of Mankind that they are &s;uffer'd to live at all.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e Cities, and a number more which in the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Times were inhabited, were &s;pread, I might &s;ay indeed throng'd with di&s;igent, nu|merous, wealthy, and virtuous Nations, popu|lous beyond mea&s;ure; the inland Towns rich, and made &s;o by their own Indu&s;try; the Sea|coa&s;t Towns addicted to Commerce, and made rich by Merchandize and foreign Di&s;coveries.</P>
<P>THEY did not go cloath'd like the naked <HI>Moors</HI> who&s;e be&s;t Garment is a Blanket or a cour&s;e woollen Mantle thrown over their Shoul|ders; with hardly other Clothes to cover their Nakedne&s;s, and the Women little more than a Veil to hide them. But in tho&s;e Days the
<PB N="98" REF="110">
<HI>Carthaginians</HI> were gay and delicate, dre&s;s'd well, and valued them&s;elves upon it; and as they Imported the Product and Manufactures of other Countries, wou'd no doubt by this time have carry'd on a mo&s;t noble, and to us, beneficial Commerce for our <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Manufactures, which even as it is now, are very valuable among them; and which wou'd have been a Trade by this time equal to that of <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portngal,</HI> only perhaps fifteen times as much.

<P>IN the mean time, to bring the thing back to what I began it for, What amends did the <HI>Romans</HI> make to the tradeing part of the World, and to the improving part of Mankind by the Conque&s;ts they made? What have they done, but rooted out an indu&s;trious People, and planted in their room a Crew of &s;trouling Vagabonds; who as they brought nothing but Brutality and Cruel|ty with them; &s;o they have left the Country to a Succe&s;&s;ion of People infinitely wor&s;e than them&s;elves; and, as to the common benefit of Mankind not at all more valuable than the Bea&s;ts of Prey which over-run the Country with them.</P>
<P>IT is true, the <HI>Romans,</HI> while their State re|mained flouri&s;hing, did in &s;ome mea&s;ure main|tain their <HI>African</HI> Conque&s;ts; but notwith&s;tand|ing this the havock of People which they made in the la&s;t Punick War, in which 'tis &s;aid, above a <HI>Million</HI> of People lo&s;t their Lives, was &s;uch, that when the <HI>Roman</HI> Power decay'd, and the barbarous Nations broke in upon their Empire; <HI>Africa</HI> was able to do little; the numerous Na|tions,

which the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;ubdued, were left weak; thin of People, and tho&s;e few &s;ubjected and im|poveri&s;h'd: and &s;o they were unable to re&s;i&s;t the inundations of the <HI>Goths,</HI> and after them of the <HI>Saracens</HI> and <HI>Mahometans, Moors,</HI> and O|thers; who over-run them, and by their &s;everal Conque&s;ts, brought the Country to the abandon'd Condition in which we now &s;ee it.</P>
<P>BY all this Series of Di&s;a&s;ters, <HI>Africa</HI> is now no more a place of Trade; all the Commerce of the whole Country, from the Borders of <HI>E|gypt</HI> to Cape <HI>Spartel,</HI> and from thence South to <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> is not equal, put it all together, to the Trade of the &s;ingle Port of <HI>Cadiz</HI> in <HI>Spain;</HI> no, nor to a half part of it; tho' you were to leave the Article of <HI>New Spain,</HI> and the <HI>Gal|leons</HI> out of the Account.</P>

<P>HAVING ob&s;erv'd, in the la&s;t Chapter, what a lo&s;s to the trading World the de|&s;troying of the Cities of <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Carthage</HI> &s;e|verally, were in the re&s;pective Ages that follow'd; and how little the <HI>Roman</HI> Government did, af|ter the &s;aid Conque&s;ts, to recover Trade, and encourage u&s;eful Di&s;coveries in the World; it comes of cour&s;e to look back upon the progre&s;s of the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> in the time of their Pro&s;|perity, what they did towards the improve|ment of Trade, which future Ages, <HI>had not their Ruin interven'd,</HI> might have improv'd upon, and encreas'd in the World; and by which, the great encrea&s;e of Commerce, which the World has &s;ince that arriv'd to, might have been yet much more enlarg'd.</P>
<P>THIS enquiry is not merely to look back into Antiquity; That, as I have &s;aid, being not the bu&s;ine&s;s of this Undertaking; but to &s;how us what may be, by what has been, and how evident it is, that this part of the World call'd <HI>Africa,</HI> which at pre&s;ent, &s;eems to be given up to Barrene&s;s and to wild Bea&s;ts, once was, and

&s;till might be rendred u&s;eful to the trading World, wou'd the Chri&s;tian Nations apply them|&s;elves fir&s;t to the Conque&s;t of it; and then to the planting and cultivating it for the multi|plying its Inhabitants, and bringing Trade and Arts to flouri&s;h in it, as once they did.</P>
<P>IN order then to this enquiry, and to bring it home to the propo&s;al I am to make: Let us fir&s;t &s;ee what <HI>Africa</HI> was in the height of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Pro&s;perity, or, if you plea&s;e, in the time of the &s;econd Punick War: That War, which being carry'd on by <HI>Hannibal,</HI> and transfer'd from <HI>Spain</HI> into <HI>Italy,</HI> was carry'd even to the Gates of <HI>Rome;</HI> and once, namely, after the Battle of <HI>Cann$,</HI> bid fair, had <HI>Hannibal</HI> improv'd his Victory; I &s;ay, bid fair for the ruin of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; but which, <HI>Hanni|bal</HI>'s prudence failing him, ended in the total ruin of <HI>Carthage.</HI></P>
<P><HI>The State of Africa at that Time, was this.</HI></P>
<P><HI>CARTHAGE,</HI> a noble flouri&s;hing City and Common-wealth, &s;at as Queen of the <HI>South;</HI> the City &s;eated for Commerce, as well as for Em|pire, near the Port of <HI>Golletta,</HI> commanded the Land by her victorious Armies, and the Sea by her powerful Fleets.</P>
<P>SHE was po&s;&s;e&s;t of all <HI>Africa,</HI> from <HI>Barca,</HI> bordering on <HI>Egypt,</HI> to <HI>Tangis</HI> or <HI>Tangier</HI> at the Straights Mouth, and from thence <HI>South</HI> to <HI>Santa Cruz</HI> to <HI>Cape Blanco,</HI> and even to <HI>Cape de Verd.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Numidians,</HI> a powerful, and infinitely populous Nation, with their King <HI>Jugurtha,</HI> and the <HI>Mauritanians,</HI> (a Nation as populous, tho' not &s;o fam'd in the Field, their Cavalry not being &s;o good as the <HI>Numidians)</HI> were al&s;o with their King <HI>Juba</HI> Tributaries to the <HI>Carthaginians.</HI>
<PB N="102" REF="114">
Thus &s;tood their Force by Land upon the Conti|nent of <HI>Africa.</HI></P>
<P>BEYOND, or upon the <HI>Sea,</HI> their Power was very great; they had conquer'd, and entirely po&s;&s;e&s;t the two I&s;land Kingdoms of <HI>Sardinia</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> the latter being at that time very &s;trong, for the City of <HI>Syracu&s;a</HI> was &s;aid to contain &s;ix hundred thou&s;and People.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Europe,</HI> they po&s;&s;e&s;t all <HI>Spain,</HI> except that part we now call the <HI>A&s;turias,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Navarr;</HI> and in <HI>Italy,</HI> their victorious Army was po&s;&s;e&s;t of all <HI>Calabria;</HI> great part of that we now call <HI>Tu&s;cany,</HI> the City of <HI>Capua;</HI> and in a Word were a Terror to <HI>Rome</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time that their Power was thus extended, you are to allow them to be the mo&s;t addicted to, and the greate&s;t encouragers of Trade in the whole World. As they had a Genius for Commerce, &s;o the Country they po&s;&s;e&s;t was fruit|ful in abundance of the Materials of Trade; that is to &s;ay, the mo&s;t extraordinary product of the Earth for Exportation, and the mo&s;t extraordina|ry product of a diligent indu&s;trious People in the mo&s;t ingenious Manufactures, for their Con&s;ump|tion; being the Employment of the Poor, as well in the Nations about them, as of their own Subjects; al&s;o the&s;e was exported, by them, to other Countries.</P>
<P>THEY had then, by the advantage of Num|bers at home, a great Con&s;umption of the product of other Countries, which they brought back in return for what they exported; &s;o that they had both the ends of Commerce in their own Hands.</P>
<P>THEIR Export is the chief thing to be &s;poken of here; for this certainly remains, may be reco|ver'd and re&s;tor'd, and is, or wou'd be the &s;ame, as before: As for their home Con&s;umptions of foreign Goods, that was ruin'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> in
<PB N="103" REF="115">
de&s;troying the People; and can never be re&s;tor'd till the Country is re-peopled, and the Inhabi|tants made rich and numerous as before.</P>
<P>THE product of <HI>Africa</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in four ca|pital Articles of Life; and which, as being mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary for the Su&s;tenance or Sub&s;i&s;tance of Man|kind, was acceptable in all parts of the World: The&s;e were <HI>Corn, Wine, Oil,</HI> and <HI>Salt;</HI> of the&s;e they had not plenty only, but a profu&s;ion, not only &s;ufficient to &s;upply the great City of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and the other populous Cities which they had built, and po&s;&s;e&s;t upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Utica, Tingis, Adrumetum, Aphrodi&s;ium, Tacape, Syrtes, Portus Magnus, Porta Deorum,</HI> and many more, but they had enough to &s;upply their foreign Colonies, as well on the We&s;tern Coa&s;ts of <HI>Spain,</HI> where they had &s;everal large Settlements, and which grew populous by the thronging in of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Lu&s;itanians,</HI> the <HI>Celteberians,</HI> and other Nations to them, for the &s;ake of the Liberty and the Protection they enjoy'd from the <HI>Car|thaginians;</HI> but al&s;o to all their more Southern Colonies on the We&s;tern Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa;</HI> where they had Cities and Sea-Ports, &s;ettled for the car|rying on the Trade of tho&s;e Countries, which was chiefly in Gold, and Slaves, Elephants Teeth, Drugs, Civet, and &s;uch like rich Goods, which tho&s;e Countries produce to this Day.</P>
<P>IF any Man que&s;tion how the product of tho&s;e parts of <HI>Africa</HI> was found out in tho&s;e early Times; the an&s;wer is very ea&s;y; namely, there was little or no difficulty in it, for the Ivory is found in the De&s;arts, where the Ele|phants, who after &s;everal Years, ca&s;t their Teeth, dropt, and left them; and in the &s;ame manner they are found at this Day, and no otherwi&s;e; that they kill Elephants, for the &s;ake of their Teeth, is a delu&s;ion, and a mi&s;take; nor cou'd
<PB N="104" REF="116">
the <HI>Negros</HI> kill them, or dur&s;t come near them, except the <HI>Numidians,</HI> who by Stratagems took them young, and bred them up for the Wars, which the <HI>Negroes,</HI> to this Day, under&s;tand no|thing of.</P>
<P>THEN, as to the Gold, which was fetch'd from tho&s;e Countries, it was then, as it &s;till chiefly is, in the Sands and Shoals of the prin|cipal Rivers, &s;o that the Gold and the Ivory was with great Facility produced in tho&s;e Countries, at that time, and con&s;equently the Cities and Co|lonies of the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> had great encouragement, being able to make &s;uch rich returns; on the other Hand, tho&s;e hot Climates, being within ten to fifteen Degrees of the Line producing little or no Corn, or other Fruits, for the &s;ub&s;i&s;tance of the People, were oblig'd to fetch their &s;upplies from <HI>Carthage,</HI> or the Countries about it.</P>
<P>AND here two things are very remarkable, with relation to Trade.</P>
<P N="1">I. That, had the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Government remain'd we have Rea&s;on to believe that we had found many noble Settlements and populous Cities, and perhaps Nations, upon all the We&s;tern Coa&s;ts of <HI>Africa,</HI> from Cape <HI>Spartel,</HI> quite away to the Cape of <HI>Good Hope;</HI> and which had &s;till been more con&s;iderable, we had found a civiliz'd, indu&s;trious, trading People, every where planted; prepar'd for Commerce, and furni&s;h'd with a Product fit for making their Returns for all the Manufactures, and Mer|chandizes of <HI>Europe,</HI> when we had come to trade with them.</P>
<P N="2">II. As this did not happen, but that the <HI>Cartha|ginian</HI> State was overthrown and de&s;troy'd, all
<PB N="105" REF="117">
the&s;e Settlements died in their infancy for want of tho&s;e &s;upplies; and when we, in &s;o many Ages of Time, came to di&s;cover tho&s;e Coa&s;ts, we found them either De&s;olate and Bar|ren, and almo&s;t without Inhabitants; or tho&s;e Inhabitants untaught, wild, and naked Savages, the remembrance of former People being quite lo&s;t and &s;unk out of their Minds, nor &s;o much as any civilized remains left among them.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to be a Que&s;tion, naturally coming in our way here, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Why &s;hou'd the <HI>Cartha|ginian</HI> Settlements, on this &s;ide of <HI>Africa,</HI> peri&s;h and die upon the conquering the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> whereas the like Settlements on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Andalu&s;ia, Lu&s;itania,</HI> &amp;c. remained flouri&s;hing, and encrea&s;ing, and have continued to this Day.</P>
<P>BUT the An&s;wer to this is ready, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That after the Conque&s;t of <HI>Carthage,</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> pur|&s;ued their Victory, &s;ubduing all the Coun|tries, where the former had &s;ettled their Colo|nies, in <HI>Spain</HI> and <HI>Portugal,</HI> and even into the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay;</HI> where tho' they did not propa|gate Merchandizing, and foreign Commerce, they did not &s;upplant the Nations or Cities, only &s;ubdu|ed them, and left Detachments of Soldiers to keep and maintain their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. But the ca&s;e dif|fer'd extreamly in the South; for as there were no Nations on that &s;ide worth &s;ubduing, or any Countries worth keeping po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, only Set|tlements and Colonies, which being lately made, required an expen&s;ive Supply, yearly, for their &s;upport: The&s;e the <HI>Romans,</HI> having but little Genius to Trade, and but few Merchants among them, had little or no regard to, and took no care about, and &s;o they peri&s;h'd for mere want of being &s;upported.</P>
<P><PB N="106" REF="118">
AND this I take to be the Rea&s;on al&s;o, why, tho' I am clear, that the di&s;covery and fir&s;t planting of the Continent of <HI>America</HI> was from thence, yet that Di&s;covery was no farther pro|ceeded on, after it was fir&s;t made, or the Memory of it pre&s;erv'd; but that as the Colonies in <HI>Afri|ca,</HI> from whence the fir&s;t Voyage was made to <HI>America,</HI> was abandon'd, their Patrons at <HI>Car|thage,</HI> being de&s;troy'd; &s;o with them died the very Memory of &s;uch a Di&s;covery, and all Know|ledge, that ever &s;uch a place had been found out in the World.</P>
<P>FOR as by the fall of <HI>Carthage,</HI> all the depend|ing Colonies, which the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> had planted, fell to ruin, and to an irrecoverable decay, even into perfect oblivion; &s;o it follow'd, by a natural Con&s;equence, that all their farther Di&s;coveries, made by way of Adventure, or otherwi&s;e, by private Per&s;ons, from tho&s;e decay'd Colonies, died with them; for if the&s;e Colonies, tho' very con&s;i|derable, died with the fall of their Patrons the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> well might tho&s;e Sub&s;equent, or as we may call them &s;econd hand Di&s;coveries and Improvements, fall with the de&s;truction of their fir&s;t undertakers.</P>
<P>NOR is it at all improbable, but that the People, who had, by Shipping, been brought to &s;ettle on the We&s;tern Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> by the care, and at the expence of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Merchants, or at the expence of the Public; &s;uppo&s;e by the Hands of that great pur&s;uer of new Di&s;coveries, <HI>Hanno,</HI> who I take to be the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Sir <HI>Wal|ter Raleigh,</HI> as afterwards Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh</HI> was call'd the <HI>Engli&s;h Hanno;</HI> I &s;ay it is not improbable, but that when <HI>Hanno,</HI> their Protector, was &s;lain, the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Republick overthrown, and the City of <HI>Carthage</HI> it &s;elf de&s;troy'd, the Inhabi|tants of &s;ome or other of the&s;e Settlements, be|ing
<PB N="107" REF="119">
made de&s;perate by their Calamities, might embark at all hazards for fear of their cruel Ene|mies the <HI>Romans,</HI> and following the People, who they had before happily landed in <HI>America,</HI> might arrive there them&s;elves, and make as effectual e&s;cape from the <HI>Romans,</HI> as their Ance&s;tors the <HI>Tingitanian Cannanites</HI> did formerly from the Face of <HI>Jo&s;hua</HI> the Robber, when they &s;ettled at <HI>Tangier,</HI> and began the <HI>Mauritanian</HI> Kingdoms of <HI>Afric.</HI></P>
<P>AND this may be the more probable, from the Similitude of Manners and Cu&s;toms, between the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> and the <HI>Americans;</HI> many of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Cu&s;toms; and &s;ome &s;ay many of their very Words being retain'd among the <HI>Americans,</HI> even to the time that the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> under the Great <HI>Cortez</HI> arriv'd there; particularly, many of their idolatrous Cu&s;toms, Sacrificings, Conjur|ings, and other barberous u&s;ages in the Wor&s;hip of their Gods.</P>
<P>IT is too large a Work to enter upon here, but tho&s;e who are curious enough to &s;earch into tho&s;e things, may ob&s;erve, that the Heathen Temples, erected at <HI>Mexico,</HI> and at <HI>Cu&s;co,</HI> with the manner of their Sacrifices, had a great re&s;emblance of, and affinity to the &s;ame Rites among the <HI>Numidi|ans</HI> and <HI>Carthaginians.</HI></P>
<P>ABOVE all, the antient Forms of Government by the <HI>Inca</HI>'s of <HI>Peru,</HI> the Cu&s;toms and U&s;ages of <HI>Attabalipa,</HI> the <HI>Peruvian</HI> King; their Regi&s;ters, Archives, and Laws, were &s;o &s;trangely Simular, and &s;uch &s;trong Re&s;emblance to the Courts and Governments of the <HI>Numidian,</HI> and <HI>Mauritanian</HI> Courts, that it Legitimates their de&s;cent from them, as much as any thing of that kind, and &s;o remote in time can be &s;uppos'd to do.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides all this, the <HI>Peruveans</HI> e&s;pecially, and the <HI>Mexicans</HI> al&s;o, but e&s;pecially the former, had many antient Traditions, and traditional Pro|phecies
<PB N="108" REF="120">
among them, which plainly related to the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Nation, tho' the va&s;t di&s;tance of Time, Ignorance of the People, and entire want of the u&s;e of Letters, obliterated the&s;e remains, &s;o as to make them not legible to them&s;elves, and but very little to the <HI>European</HI> Nations, which came &s;o long after them.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome difficulties &s;tarted about their Tran&s;portation from <HI>Africa</HI> to <HI>America,</HI> the carrying over with them Women and Children, the carrying living Creatures, Bea&s;ts of Prey, and the like, the length of the Voyage, the Ignorance in Navigation, and the want of Ships, all which are ea&s;ily an&s;wer'd, as follows, and with that I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s the Subject.</P>
<P>THE Shipping of the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> was at that time &s;o very con&s;iderable, that we find them fitting out large Navies for the War, in which, for a great while they were Superior to the <HI>Ro|mans;</HI> and we find them trading with large Ships to all the Coa&s;ts of the <HI>Mediterranean,</HI> and on the We&s;t-&s;ide of <HI>Africa</HI> and <HI>Europe,</HI> from the Latitude of fifteen to fifty Degrees in the Ocean, and how much farther we are not certain; but the infer|ence I draw from it, is this, Why might not the &s;ame Ships, which cou'd cro&s;s the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> the Bay of <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> Sea, from <HI>Carthage</HI> to <HI>Sardinia,</HI> and <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> which are all turbulent, outragious, and dangerous Seas, as well pa&s;s tho&s;e &s;o much more pacifick Seas, from the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands to the <HI>Caribbees,</HI> or to the <HI>Cape St. Augu&s;tine</HI> on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> where mo&s;t of the way they have a Trade Wind, or a &s;trong Current, or both, to favour them, with a quick Pa&s;&s;age, as well as a &s;afe? Why not as well as it has been po&s;&s;ible for Men to go from <HI>Barbadoes</HI> to <HI>Jamaica;</HI> nay, from <HI>Jamaica</HI> to the <HI>Honduras</HI> in a Ship's long Boat, nay even in a Pinnace, without
<PB N="109" REF="121">
any Deck or Shelter, or room to &s;tow Provi&s;ions or Water, more than for two or three Days.</P>
<P>IF then the Pa&s;&s;age, which we know was practi|cable, might be thus perform'd, why &s;hou'd it be impracticable for them to carry with them Wo|men, Children, Fowles, or any other Creatures, at lea&s;t any &s;uch as were found in <HI>America,</HI> when it was la&s;t di&s;cover'd.</P>
<P>IN order, however, to make the&s;e things ea&s;y to the Under&s;tanding, I de&s;ire my Reader to take notice, that I am not &s;uppo&s;ing, that this Di&s;cove|ry was merely accidental, by &s;ome Ship being driven off to Sea in a Tempe&s;t, and hurry'd away to the Coa&s;t of <HI>America</HI> by the &s;tre&s;s of Weather, without any previous de&s;ign, tho' even that part is far from impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;uppo&s;e the Voyage to be perform'd up|on a &s;ettled de&s;ign of &s;earching after new Di&s;cove|ries; That the Ve&s;&s;el, &s;o fitted out for &s;uch a de|&s;ign, might be &s;et out at &s;ome of the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Settlements on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Afric;</HI> &s;uppo&s;e about the River <HI>Senegal,</HI> that is to &s;ay, the Mouth of the River <HI>Niger,</HI> or from the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P>YOU may allow, if you plea&s;e, that &s;ome other Ship, bound from the Shore of <HI>Afric,</HI> to tho&s;e I&s;lands, had fir&s;t been driven &s;o far to the We&s;tward, as to have di&s;covered &s;ome of the Mountains of <HI>America</HI> at a great di&s;tance; but not thinking fit to venture any farther, had made the be&s;t of their way back as &s;oon as Wind and Weather wou'd ad|mit, but brought the News with them that there was Land to be &s;een that way, that there was a new World, and that whoever pleas'd to make the Adventure might find new Countries for Com|merce.</P>
<P>THAT this News &s;hou'd fire the Minds of a Nation, naturally enclin'd to Adventures, and new Di&s;coveries, wou'd be much lel&s;s matter of
<PB N="110" REF="122">
Wonder, than it wou'd be that they &s;hou'd hear of it without any motion, or any &s;tirring up of their Curio&s;ity for the attempt; but that the attempt was feizible, I &s;ee nothing of room for an Objecti|on; they who&s;e Ships were able to keep the Sea in &s;uch Voyages, which they really did perform; and on &s;uch occa&s;ions as they were oblig'd to do when driven out of their knowledge, as above; might certainly be able to perform &s;uch a Voyage as this, in a fair Weather Sea, a Trade Wind, and a Leeward Current; &s;o that in a Word the dif|ficulty was nothing; nor can I make any doubt, that the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Merchants did perform the Voyage, and &s;ettled them&s;elves in <HI>America,</HI> when <HI>Carthage</HI> being de&s;troy'd by the <HI>Romans,</HI> they were abandon'd to Want and De&s;pair; than I make a doubt whether <HI>Carthage</HI> was de&s;troy'd or no. As for their carrying over wild Bea&s;ts, or the manner how wild Bea&s;ts might come into <HI>America,</HI> I think as ea&s;y to explain as all the re&s;t; but &s;hall not en|ter into it here, being foreign to our pre&s;ent pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>I SHALL conclude this Chapter with going back to what I was upon, at the beginning of it; namely, the Product of <HI>Africa</HI> when under the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Government; by which the Merchants of <HI>Carthage</HI> were &s;upply'd for Exportation to for|reign Countries, and in return for which they brought back the growth and Manufactures of tho&s;e Countries to which they were Exported.</P>
<P>I HAVE mention'd already four very mate|rial Articles <HI>(viz.)</HI> Corn, Wine, Salt, and Oil, the&s;e they had in great quantity, e&s;pecially <HI>Corn,</HI> and <HI>Oil,</HI> and were able to &s;upply all the Northern parts of the World with them; but e&s;pecially the I&s;lands of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the <HI>Archipelagoe,</HI> the Provinces of <HI>Greece,</HI> and in times of Peace <HI>Italy</HI> it &s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="123">
BUT this was not all; They had in the next place Iron and Copper; the la&s;t was not only the be&s;t of its kind in the World, but if I mi&s;take not, the only place in the World where fine Copper was found. This Copper was carry'd, in particular, to <HI>Corinth,</HI> where the <HI>Lapis Calaminaris</HI> being found, they melted the Copper, and produc'd the Bra&s;s, which in tho&s;e Days was of &s;o much Value, as to be equal to Gold. Hence, no doubt, <HI>Solomon</HI> &s;up|plyed him&s;elf with Bra&s;s for the famous Uten|&s;ils of the Temple; where it is &s;aid the Bra&s;s was without weight; that is to &s;ay, the quantity was &s;o great it could not be ca&s;t up: And hence the <HI>Co|rinthian</HI> Bra&s;s was e&s;teem'd the mo&s;t precious of any other kind. As to the Iron, it was found in <HI>Numidia,</HI> and Exported to <HI>Italy,</HI> to <HI>Greece,</HI> and to <HI>Spain;</HI> and was in tho&s;e Days very valuable and u&s;eful.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e, they had a very great quan|tity of Figs, Almonds Rai&s;ins, Limons, Pomegra|nates, and other Fruit; all which they exported in Merchandize, be&s;ides the quantities which they con&s;umed at home.</P>
<P>THEY had al&s;o a great Trade in Hor&s;es; which in times of Peace they &s;ent over to <HI>Sicily, Sardinia,</HI> and <HI>Italy;</HI> al&s;o into <HI>Greece,</HI> and into <HI>Spain;</HI> and the fine breed of <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Jennets, which are to this Day &s;o valuable in <HI>Spain,</HI> are &s;aid to be produc'd fir&s;t from the Race of the <HI>Numidians</HI> Hor&s;es, which were at that time e&s;teem'd the fine&s;t and &s;wifte&s;t in the World.</P>
<P>NEXT to this, They had great quantities of Honey, and Wax; the fir&s;t, of which, was at that time an extraordinary Article of Merchandize, there being no &s;uch thing as Sugar then known in the World.</P>
<P>WE have &s;ome Rea&s;on to think they had al&s;o Rice, a &s;ort of Product, which we do not
<PB N="112" REF="124">
read much of in tho&s;e times, tho' &s;ince it is become very valuable.</P>
<P>THESE particular Merchandizes were the pro|duct of the inland Countries in general; but be|&s;ides the&s;e they had &s;everal other things, which they fetch'd from the remoter Coa&s;ts, and were to be had in this or that particular Country only; as Civet, Emeralds, and Balm, from <HI>Ethiopia;</HI> Gold and Elephants Teeth, from the Coa&s;t of the We&s;t towards the <HI>Cape de Verd;</HI> Lyons, Leopards, Ty|gers, and O&s;triches, from the De&s;arts of <HI>Mauri|tania.</HI></P>
<P>NOW to look back upon all the&s;e things, 'tis evident they not only were at that time the product of <HI>Africa,</HI> but they are &s;o &s;till, and may be recover'd were numbers of People to be found at home to propagate them, they wou'd, I &s;ay, be recover'd to as great a degree as ever; for to this Day the <HI>French,</HI> the <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> and the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> fetch great quantities of Corn, Oil, Salt, Wax, and Honey from <HI>Barbary;</HI> nor wou'd the Wine, the Almonds, Figs, Limons, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> be le&s;s valuable, but that <HI>Spain, France,</HI> and <HI>Italy,</HI> abound in all tho&s;e things them&s;elves.</P>
<P>AS to the <HI>Copper,</HI> the <HI>Gold,</HI> the <HI>Iron,</HI> the <HI>Civet,</HI> the <HI>Emeralds,</HI> and the <HI>Wax,</HI> they are all to this Day as valuable there as ever; and are the only, or chief Articles of Trade which they have among them. But all together &s;hew us, how great an Im|provement of Trade it might be to the World to have the Continent of <HI>Africa</HI> put into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|on of the diligent indu&s;trious Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> who were able, and had a Genius apt to cultivate the Soil, and rai&s;e the Product to the &s;ame height, which it may be, and has been at: But of that by it &s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X. <HI>Of the &s;tate of Trade and Di&s;covery, after the ruin of</HI> Tyre <HI>and</HI> Carthage; <HI>and how Com|merce went back to its Original, and began again only as Nature and the Laws of Nece&s;|&s;ity directed.</HI></HEAD>
<P><HI>TYRE</HI> being de&s;troy'd by <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> as has been di&s;tinctly accounted for; one ef|fect was, that the Trade between <HI>Per&s;ia, Armenia,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> on the one Hand; The Merchants of <HI>Tyre,</HI> and by their means <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Africa</HI> on the other, was entirely interrupted, and put to an end; that is to &s;ay, the Commerce of the <HI>Indies</HI> with <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>Africa,</HI> was put to an end.</P>
<P>THE Commerce of the <HI>Indies,</HI> and of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> was from the beginning a Trade in Silks, and fine Works in embroidery of Gold and Silver; as al&s;o in Spices and choice Gums, Ointments, Drugs, &amp;c. Hence the <HI>Babyloni&s;h</HI> Garment, &s;tolen by <HI>Achan,</HI> was &s;uppos'd to be a Robe of Silk Em|broidered with Gold. Hence the fetching Gold from <HI>Ophir,</HI> &s;aid to be the I&s;land of <HI>Sumatra,</HI> was a Trade, tho' enter'd into by King <HI>Solomon,</HI> practis'd long before by the <HI>Tyrians:</HI> And from this begin|ning, the Trade both of <HI>India,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> is to this Day carry'd on, and is &s;till a Trade in raw and wrought Silks, Spices, Drugs, Perfumes, &amp;c.</P>
<P>THIS Commerce, as I have &s;aid, was certainly began by the Merchants of <HI>Tyre,</HI> and may be &s;up|pos'd to be carry'd on thus, before <HI>Solomons</HI> Days long enough. (1) The <HI>Tyrians</HI> had a Trade with <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> and con&s;equently with <HI>Bactria</HI> and <HI>Kathay,</HI>
<PB N="114" REF="126">
which is <HI>Tartary</HI> and <HI>India;</HI> which Trade was carry'd on by Land, whether by Caravans from <HI>Babylon,</HI> (as is now the practice, from <HI>Bagdat,</HI> from <HI>Tauris,</HI> and from <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora)</HI> to <HI>Aleppo,</HI> or whether, by ordinary Carriage, the De&s;arts per|haps being at that time better inhabited; that part we cannot with any certainty be a&s;&s;ured of.</P>
<P>BY this Land conveyance they receiv'd all the rich Manufactures of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> the Product of tho&s;e various Countries, of which, the Silk was the &s;pecial peculiar growth.

<P>I SHALL trouble my Reader with no more Scripture Digre&s;&s;ion; tho', I think, this cannot be call'd a Digre&s;&s;ion; but I come back to the Ca&s;e in Hand. All the&s;e things, were at fir&s;t, brought by Land to the City of <HI>Tyre,</HI> or at lea&s;t, being brought by Sea to the Gulph of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> were afterwards brought over Land by Caravans; and that I un|der&s;tand to be meant by the Merchants of <HI>Sheba</HI> and <HI>Dedan,</HI> who were certainly <HI>Arabians</HI> border|ing on the South Coa&s;t, and who fetch'd tho&s;e Goods, by Water, from the Coa&s;t of <HI>India;</HI> nay from the River <HI>Indus,</HI> the &s;ame Country which we now call <HI>Guzurratte</HI> and <HI>Suratte, Bombay,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Malabar;</HI> and which were brought down to tho&s;e Coa&s;ts and Rivers by Land, from <HI>Agra, Termed, Lahore,</HI> and other Towns and Countries bordering on the great Rivers <HI>Oxus</HI> and <HI>Ganges;</HI> from whence they receiv'd the Riches of the farther <HI>India,</HI> namely, the Diamonds of <HI>Golconda,</HI> the Gold of <HI>A|chim, Sumatra,</HI> (the &s;ame as <HI>Ophir)</HI> and the Spices of <HI>Java,</HI> and the <HI>Moluccas.</HI></P>
<P>NOW all the&s;e, I &s;ay, came to <HI>Tyre</HI> by Land, that is to &s;ay, by Caravans; and 'tis evident they did &s;o for many Ages, and even to the time of the Siege and taking of their City by the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI> Monarch: But yet many Years before that, the adventuring Merchants of <HI>Tyre</HI> had made attempts to go directly to tho&s;e Countries by Sea; and ac|cordingly, by permi&s;&s;ion of the King of <HI>Egypt,</HI> had fitted out Ships in the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> who, <HI>as I have &s;aid already,</HI> coa&s;ted the whole Southern part of the World, till then unknown.</P>
<P><PB N="118" REF="130">
THAT this was &s;o is evident, in that, when <HI>Solomon</HI> had a mind to dip into that Trade, he hir'd Ships of <HI>Hiram</HI> the King of <HI>Tyre;</HI> and they are call'd <HI>Hiram</HI>'s Ships, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> x. 11. <HI>The Navy</HI> al&s;o of <HI>Hiram</HI> the King of <HI>Tyre</HI> brought <HI>Almug Trees,</HI> and <HI>precious Stones,</HI> as well as Gold <HI>from</HI> Ophir. It is indeed &s;aid, in the Chapter preceding, <HI>ver&s;e</HI> 26. <HI>Solomon</HI> made a Navy of Ships in <HI>Ezion. Geber,</HI> and <HI>Hiram</HI> &s;ent in that Navy his Servants, <HI>Shipmen that had knowledge of the Sea;</HI> the matter was this, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that <HI>Solomon</HI> being po&s;&s;e&s;t of <HI>Ezion Geber,</HI> which was a good Sea port, on the &s;ide of the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> in the Country of <HI>Idumaea</HI> or <HI>Edom,</HI> he gave <HI>Hiram</HI> leave to build Ships of Burthen there, and then hir'd them of him to go to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI></P>
<P>AND this he did becau&s;e he found the <HI>Tyrians</HI> had us'd that Trade before, and that it was very much to their advantage; and now, the Port belong|ing to him (King <HI>Solomon) Hiram</HI> could not do it without his leave.</P>
<P>BUT yet, after this Trade was found out, the Goods brought back were to be carryed a great way by Land-carriage, even thro' all the Wilderne&s;s, the &s;ame which the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> had long wandered in before they came to the Land of <HI>Canaan;</HI> thro' all this Country, I &s;ay, the Goods were to be brought over Land before they came to <HI>Solomon:</HI> And we find <HI>Solomon</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd a rate of Carriage after|wards, to perform this, 1 <HI>Kings</HI> x. 29. a Chariot for &s;ix hundred Shekels, and a Hor&s;e for one hundred and fifty; and thus the Trade was carryed on for &s;ome time; for tho' <HI>Solomon</HI> was a wi&s;e King he was but a young Merchant.</P>
<P>THIS laid the foundation of what afterwards was con&s;iderably improv'd; namely, of fetching all the Spices and Jewels, Silks and Drugs, &amp;c. (the product of <HI>India)</HI> by Sea to <HI>Sues,</HI> a Sea-port, on the utmo&s;t point Northward of the <HI>Red Sea;</HI>
<PB N="119" REF="131">
from whence they were carry'd, by Land, to <HI>Da|miata,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and thence again, by Sea, to all the known Ports or trading Towns of <HI>Europe;</HI> and this had been <HI>Solomon</HI>'s be&s;t way then. But &s;ince <HI>Solomon</HI> was &s;o wi&s;e a Man, &s;o great a Prince, &s;o in&s;pir'd a Genius, how came it, that he did not under&s;tand the frame and figure of the Globe, the &s;ituation of Places; how the Sea and the Land were extended, how the for|mer was every where joyn'd; and that con&s;equent|ly the communication of Water was to be found out to all parts of the Earth, inland Lakes except|ed? Had he known this, he might have built his Ships at <HI>Tyre,</HI> and &s;ailed about as we do now.</P>
<P>THIS important Que&s;tion brings me to the Subject, which is the main motive of this Work. This Wi&s;dom was hid from tho&s;e Ages, even from <HI>So|lomon</HI> him&s;elf; and this makes me &s;ay, tho' he was a wi&s;e Man, he was but a young Merchant. <HI>No, no,</HI> this Knowledge was left for Di&s;covery; it was to be a whet to the Indu&s;try of future Times; it was to be &s;earch'd out at infinite Hazard by an Art [Navigation] which they knew little of, I mean, a Mathematical Navigation, which the World, at that time, under&s;tood nothing of; for the Mathematicks were not concern'd in the Navi|gation for many Ages after. But to return to the Trade, as it then was.</P>
<P>Thus &s;tood the Trade of the World when <HI>Tyre</HI> was fir&s;t de&s;troy'd, <HI>(viz.)</HI> by <HI>Nebuchadnezzar;</HI> nor, as I have &s;aid, did his taking that City give any great blow to the Commerce it&s;elf; for the Merchants, and wealthy Citizens, having tran&s;port|ed them&s;elves, and their Goods, to <HI>Cyprus, Sicily, Crete,</HI> to <HI>Carthage,</HI> and other places, which were their own Colonies, as has been noted before, they found means to carry on their bu&s;ine&s;s; till the rage of the War was over, and the <HI>A&s;&s;yrian</HI>

Tyrant was dead; and then they came back, re|built their City and Port, and became infinitely greater, richer, and &s;tronger than they were be|fore; and this &s;econd greatne&s;s continued &s;everal hundred Years, till the la&s;t fatal Attack, made upon them, by <HI>Alexander the Great,</HI> which put a final end, not to the City only, but even to the name of a <HI>Phoenician,</HI> or of a Merchant, among them.</P>
<P>THIS indeed was not a &s;top to their Trade, but an utter ruin to it; for <HI>Alexander</HI> took the City by Storm, murther'd 26000 of the Citizens in the heat of Blood, hang'd 2000 of the mo&s;t wealthy Merchants, upon Gibbets or Cro&s;&s;es, all on a row, for &s;ix Miles in length, on the Sea|&s;hore; in a Word, he re&s;olved, in his tyrannic Rage, to make him&s;elf a Terror to the re&s;t of the World, and to make <HI>Tyre</HI> an Example of it, to terrify any other City that &s;hou'd dare to &s;tand out again&s;t him; and as to them, he did every thing he could to blot out the remembrance of the City of <HI>Tyre</HI> from under Heaven, and not to leave the name of a <HI>Tyrian</HI> Merchant remaining in the World; and all in revenge for their refu&s;ing to let him peaceably into their City; which if they had done, it was &s;aid, he re&s;olved to have done the &s;ame, having vow'd the City a Sacrifice to his Fury, upon &s;ome former re&s;entments not made public.</P>
<P>BUT when the heat, or fire, of his Anger was thus quench'd, by the Blood of &s;uch a multitude of innocent People, and the ruin of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing City in the World; the &s;eat of Trade, and the center of all foreign Negotiation, he &s;oon relented when it was too late; he was con|vinc'd what a blow he had &s;trook to the general Corre&s;pondence of Mankind; and how he had, <HI>as it were,</HI> put a &s;top to the Trade of the World; and finding it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;tore

<P>NOW tho' he could never, by all the invitations he made to the Merchants of all Nations, to come and &s;ettle there, and the privileges he gave them, and promi&s;es of greater, which he made them, bring the Trade of <HI>Tyre</HI> to center at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> as he expected; yet the Port of <HI>Sues,</HI> in the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> call'd at that time <HI>Suz</HI> or <HI>Elim,</HI> and being like|wi&s;e enlarg'd by him, &s;tanding well to receive the Trade from the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies;</HI> and there being no other Port in the World for it, the&s;e Merchandi|zes being of cour&s;e now brought over Land to the <HI>Nile,</HI> and &s;o by the <HI>Nile</HI> to his new City of <HI>Alex|andria,</HI> the Trade came in time, by the &s;ame cour&s;e of things, to center naturally at <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and made it a place of very great Bu&s;ine&s;s, tho' no|thing like the antient City of <HI>Tyre</HI> which he had de&s;troyed; the de&s;truction of which was &s;o mortal a blow to the Trade of the World, at that time, that it never recovered it&s;elf; that is to &s;ay, it never came to fix in one place afterwards; but di|vided, and ran confu&s;ed into &s;everal Chanels: In all which &s;everal Chanels I &s;hall trace it as we find it in Hi&s;tory; now fixt and flouri&s;hing here, and then there; now unfixt and remov'd by the Wars, and by the cruelty of conquering Princes, and States; till at la&s;t the Northern Nations, namely, the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> then the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and now the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> finding out and pur&s;uing the Trade to <HI>India,</HI> by a pa&s;&s;age round the Sea-coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> all that branch of Trade from <HI>India</HI> to the <HI>Red Sea</HI> is forgotten and dropt out of the World; whether

<P>THE ruin of <HI>Tyre,</HI> I mean this la&s;t and fatal De&s;truction of it, as a trading City happen'd in the Year of the World 3618, about 330 Years before Chri&s;t.

Mundi</HI> 3618, after which the Trade, which was carry'd on there, as the center of the World's Commerce, divided it&s;elf, and run in different Chanels as follows.</P>
<P>The <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Trade, as I have &s;aid, was carry'd on by the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and <HI>Arabians;</HI> who&s;e Ships, bringing the <HI>Ea&s;t-India</HI> Goods, &s;uch as wrought Silks, Spices, Drugs, Diamonds, Pearl, Callicoes, dying Stuffs, Salt Peter, Indigo, red Earth, &amp;c. being brought to <HI>Sues,</HI> and thence to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> the <HI>Venetians</HI> got into that port, and carry'd tho&s;e Goods from thence all over the Northern World.</P>
<P>That part of the Trade of <HI>India</HI> Goods, which came from the <HI>Ganges,</HI> and the Kingdom of <HI>Bengal,</HI> into <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> was brought to <HI>Samareand, Per&s;epolis,</HI> and other Cities and Countries near the <HI>Ca&s;pian</HI> Sea; and from thence were landed again in <HI>Ge|orgia,</HI> and carry'd over Land to <HI>Erzirum,</HI> and to <HI>Trapezond,</HI> on the Banks of the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea; and from thence again were brought into the <HI>Mediter|ranean;</HI> and thus the City of <HI>Corinth</HI> became a mighty center for Commerce, many of the <HI>Tyrian</HI> Merchants, who fled from their City, before <HI>Alex|ander</HI> had inve&s;ted it, having &s;ettled at <HI>Corinth,</HI> and by their Corre&s;pondence with their old Friends in <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> drawing a large Chanel of Trade that way made <HI>Corinth</HI> a great, populous, trad|ing, and con&s;equently a wealthy City.</P>

<P>THIS is exemplified, not in the ca&s;e of <HI>Alex|andria</HI> and the City of <HI>Tyre</HI> only, but in all places of note, that I have now been nameing; and e&s;pe|cially in this, That all the&s;e flouri&s;hing places, to

<HEAD>CHAP. XI. <HI>Of the Blow given to Trade by the ruin of</HI> Co|rinth <HI>and</HI> Carthage. <HI>The new turn Trade took in the &s;ucceeding Ages; and by what &s;low degrees it began to revive in the World, and in what Places.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the <HI>Roman</HI> Conque&s;t had checkt, and almo&s;t &s;uppre&s;t Commerce, &s;o it greatly di&s;|courag'd Navigation. As I &s;aid before, the Trade being ruin'd, and the Sailors de&s;troy'd, the Ships, had they been left, were generally u&s;ele&s;s or un|employ'd. As for the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> the very Name was &s;unk; they were no more a City, much le&s;s a Government; their Ships of War were all burnt;
<PB N="127" REF="139">
their Ships for Trade had neither Merchant to em|ploy them, or Sailors to navigate them: In a word, Trade and Navigation &s;eem'd to be both &s;truck as with a dead Pal&s;y both at once; and we ought to look at them both as in a wor&s;e condition for Improvements than they were in 1000 Years before, I mean when <HI>Tyrus</HI> was taken by the <HI>A&s;&s;y|rian</HI> King: Like a Man running a Race, who by &s;ome unhappy di&s;&s;a&s;ter, or mi&s;take, has his Ground to run all over again, and with di&s;advantage too; &s;o that now there was no pro&s;pect of Recovery, Trade had no view of a Re&s;toration.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> took <HI>Tyre,</HI> the di&s;pers'd Citizens had a retreat, from whence to recover their Trade again. When <HI>Alexander the Great</HI> ruin'd it, he him&s;elf, as noted above, took care of the Commerce, by erecting <HI>Alexandria</HI> as a Staple of Trade to re&s;tore it to the World But when <HI>Carthage</HI> was de&s;troy'd, the Victors, thoughtle&s;s of the public good of Mankind, and unconcern'd for Trade, left her utterly abandon'd and for|&s;aken; no Patron left to re&s;tore her flouri&s;hing Government; they took neither any care for it them&s;elves, or left any one el&s;e to do it; but in &s;hort, all things were left to mere Nature, and Trade was to return only as the con&s;equence of Mens finding it needful to corre&s;pond with one another.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t appearance of any thing that de|&s;erv'd the name of Commerce, after the De&s;tructi|on of the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> was the nece&s;&s;ary &s;up|plies of Corn which were wanted for the &s;upport of the City of <HI>Rome:</HI> This employ'd &s;ome Shipping to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and to <HI>Egypt,</HI> and <HI>Syria,</HI> according as the Con&s;uls, who had the care of tho&s;e things, directed; in which Ca&s;e, the Corn was not &s;o much an Article of Trade, as a payment of Tribute to the State from the Coun|tries
<PB N="128" REF="140">
whence it came. The Con&s;uls &s;ending Orders to the Procon&s;uls, and Governours of Provinces, to &s;end &s;uch and &s;uch &s;upplies of Corn for the u&s;e of the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI> as was required; and to pay for the &s;ame out of the ordinary Tribute. This frequently oblig'd the &s;aid Procon&s;uls to hire Ships for that Service, and kept up in &s;ome &s;mall mea&s;ure the employment of Ships and Sea|men.</P>
<P>THIS was the Ca&s;e of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> when on his Voyage to <HI>Rome,</HI> he fir&s;t embark'd in a Ship be|longing to <HI>Adramyttium,</HI> which was a City near the <HI>Helle&s;pont,</HI> in the antient <HI>Greece;</HI> and after|wards to embark in another Ship loaden with Corn, in the I&s;land of <HI>Crete,</HI> or <HI>Candia.</HI> But this went but a little way towards reviving of that va&s;t Commerce which was de&s;troy'd by the ruin of the <HI>Carthaginians.</HI></P>
<P>THE next di&s;covery of Trade, or any thing which look'd like it, was the nece&s;&s;ity which the Merchants of <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> found them&s;elves in, of &s;elling or venting their Goods, which they or the <HI>Egyptians</HI> for them, brought con&s;tantly up the <HI>Red Sea</HI> to <HI>Egypt;</HI> and which from thence, be|ing carry'd to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> were before that time bought up there by the <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Merchants, and carry'd in their own Ships to <HI>Carthage,</HI> and from thence &s;old and exported by them to all the parts of the World that were known at that time: But the&s;e <HI>Carthaginian</HI> Merchants now fail|ing to come to Market, their City being burnt and de&s;troy'd, and their Shipping al&s;o; the <HI>Indi|an</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchandizes were left un&s;old, and perhaps the Merchants who brought them ruin'd and undone; being not able to find any Market wherein to di&s;po&s;e of the Goods they brought, or to make returns in &s;uch Goods as they had occa&s;i|on for in their own Country.</P>
<P><PB N="129" REF="141">
THIS cau&s;ed the Merchants of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> by degrees, to &s;eek and find out a Market for their Goods wherever they could have it; and particu|larly the Cities on the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Italy,</HI> and <HI>Gaul, [France]</HI> the I&s;lands of the Le&s;&s;er <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and the Shores of <HI>Greece,</HI> by little and little became ac|quainted with the Trade, and dealt in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> with the Merchants of <HI>India,</HI> or rather with the <HI>Arabians</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians;</HI> for they were indeed the Per&s;ons who brought the Goods to <HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<Q>N. B. <HI>Here it is to be noted, that even then, and ever &s;ince then to this Day, the</HI> Indian <HI>and</HI> Arabian <HI>Merchants, who have brought their Goods this way for a Market, have been unconcern'd in the Wars, and Overturnings, which the ambition of Men have embroil'd the</HI> European <HI>World with; on the contrary, they have been a peace|able trading People, who have only &s;ought to pu&s;h on their bu&s;ine&s;s in a quiet manner, &s;elling their Goods, and taking hack either &s;uch Money as they could get, or &s;uch Goods as were vendi|ble in their own Country. And thus the</HI> Arme|nians <HI>and</HI> Georgians, <HI>(who are the &s;ame kind of People) act to this Day; coming with their Bales of Silk, their Drugs and Galls, Grograms, Ca|mel's Hair, and other Goods, to</HI> Aleppo, <HI>to</HI> Scandaroon, <HI>or Little</HI> Alexandria; <HI>and others of them, to the Gulph of</HI> Per&s;ia, <HI>to the famous City of</HI> Ormus, <HI>and thence into</HI> Egypt, <HI>and to</HI> Alexandria <HI>it&s;elf.</HI></Q>
<P>THESE Merchants, no doubt, were for a while under great Di&s;appointments when they mi&s;s'd their old Corre&s;pondents, the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> who at certain Sea&s;ons fail'd not to meet them at <HI>Alexandria</HI> to buy their Goods. What cour&s;es they took to &s;ell their Wares, at fir&s;t, we can|not,
<PB N="130" REF="142">
at this di&s;tance, give a particular Account of; but this we find Rea&s;on to conclude from &s;ome circum&s;tances of Trade, which follow'd; namely, that this after the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Merchants were found at <HI>Corinth,</HI> whither they came from <HI>Trape&s;ond,</HI> and from <HI>Tripoli,</HI> in <HI>Cappadocia,</HI> on the <HI>Euxine</HI> Sea; bringing their Merchandizes down among the <HI>Graecians;</HI> and which they did, with &s;uch good &s;ucce&s;s, that in a few Years <HI>Corinth</HI> re|viv'd and became a populous, rich, and trading City, e&s;pecially in that part, which might then be call'd the <HI>Indian</HI> Trade, as we now call it the <HI>Turkey</HI> Trade.</P>
<P>IN the mean time there &s;prung up a &s;mall in|fant Corre&s;pondence between the Citizens of <HI>Mar|&s;eilles,</HI> and tho&s;e of <HI>Alexandria. Mar&s;eilles</HI> was a City then under the <HI>Roman</HI> Government, and &s;o was not liable to the Deva&s;tation which <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Carthage</HI> had already &s;uffer'd; and therefore the Citizens and Merchants of <HI>Mar&s;eilles</HI> were mo&s;t likely to keep and carry on the Commerce they had begun, and both the City of <HI>Alexandria</HI> it&s;elf, as well as <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> grew rich, and ad|vanc'd both in Wealth and People by it, and which was more than all, in Shipping; for the <HI>Mar&s;eil|lians</HI> encourag'd by the Trade in Spices, which was the chief of the <HI>Alexandrian</HI> branch of the <HI>Indian</HI> Commerce; I &s;ay, the <HI>Mar&s;eillian</HI> Mer|chants, by being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Spice Trade, be|came, in a few Years, the principal Merchants of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, as the Merchants of <HI>Corinth</HI> had been for the Silks and fine Manufactures of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Armenia;</HI> with this difference afterwards, that the City of <HI>Corinth</HI> having been de&s;troy'd by the Con&s;ul <HI>Lucius Mummins,</HI> in the Year of <HI>Rome</HI> 607, was poor, and held it but a little while. But <HI>Mar|&s;eilles</HI> held it, and flouri&s;h'd in the Trade even till the decay of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire it&s;elf. When the

<HI>Lombards</HI> and other <HI>Italians,</HI> flying to the I&s;lands of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Sea, from the fury of the Nor|thern Nations, who broke in upon <HI>Italy,</HI> and de|fending them&s;elves there during all the inunda|tions, whether of the <HI>Goths, Vandals,</HI> or other Bar|barians, built a kind of Marine City, and call'd it <HI>Venice.</HI> The Citizens of this new City and State forming them&s;elves into a Government, af|ter the manner of antient <HI>Rome, (viz.)</HI> Senate and People, the latter divided into the Nobility and common People, as <HI>Rome</HI> was into the <HI>Plebeij</HI> and <HI>Patricij,</HI> fell unanimou&s;ly into Trade.</P>
<P>HAVING by their Wi&s;dom and Courage thus e&s;tabli&s;h'd them&s;elves, and being by the &s;ituation of their Town oblig'd to carry on all their Cor|re&s;pondence, as well as Commerce by <HI>Sea,</HI> they grew Merchants of Cour&s;e, and not only put in for a &s;hare of this happy Trade, but in time the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire them&s;elves feeling the &s;hock of the barbarous Nations, the&s;e <HI>Venetians</HI> engro&s;s'd it all to them&s;elves, and the <HI>Mar&s;eil|lians,</HI> were al&s;o finally excluded; the Spice Trade, and as we may &s;ay, the whole <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade, as to <HI>Europe,</HI> falling into the Hands of the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and remain'd with them till a few Ages ago, when the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> found the way to the <HI>Indies</HI> by the Cape of <HI>Good Hope,</HI> of which in its place.</P>
<P>THUS I have brought down the Commerce of that part of the World almo&s;t to the pre&s;ent Times; by which it may be &s;een, how the wi&s;e&s;t Nations, <HI>for &s;uch the</HI> Romans <HI>were &s;uppos'd to be,</HI> have been &s;ometimes mi&s;taken in their Conduct; and how by neglecting to promote and encourage Trade, they have in the event impoveri&s;h'd and weaken'd them&s;elves, and at lea&s;t put from them the only Wealth in the World, and the means, by which, had Trade been &s;upported and nouri&s;h'd among them as it ought to have been, they had probably
<PB N="132" REF="144">
been better able to have defended them&s;elves a|gain&s;t the barbarous Nations, which afterwards over-whelm'd them.</P>
<P>HOW evident was it, That the Cities of <HI>Tyre,</HI> of <HI>Corinth,</HI> of <HI>Carthage,</HI> and many others acquired their Wealth and Opulence by the growth of their Commerce; and tho' they were indeed overpower|ed by the Arms of the <HI>Grecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Em|perors, yet it was not but by &s;uch a Strength as the World was not able, at that time, to re&s;i&s;t; and yet even what a glorious Struggle did they all make with tho&s;e very Powers, who at the &s;ame time were Conquerors of the whole World.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand; How have we &s;een many &s;mall Cities, Governments, and States, &s;upport them&s;elves on this Foot?

<HEAD>CHAP. XII. <HI>An Argument from what has been &s;aid for en|gaging the Chri&s;tian Powers of</HI> Europe <HI>to root out the Barbarians, and Pirates, and re&s;tore the Peace and Commerce of</HI> Africa, <HI>&s;o profitable to</HI> Europe.</HEAD>
<P>HAVING thus mention'd that the <HI>Carthagi|nian</HI> Empire in tho&s;e Days was the &s;eat of Trade; and that <HI>Africa,</HI> which was their pe|culiar Dominion, was in particular a Country enrich'd, peopled, and made powerful by Com|merce, it comes in my way of Cour&s;e to en|quire what was its Condition afterwards, what it is now, and what is the Rea&s;on, that in a World &s;o inclin'd to Commerce, and &s;o encourag'd to carry it on as this is, and is like to be, this Country of <HI>Africa,</HI> once &s;o great, &s;o furni&s;h'd for and improv'd in Bu&s;ine&s;s, is not re&s;tor'd to its former Glory and Wealth; and this I &s;hall couch in a very &s;ew Words.</P>
<P>AFTER the de&s;truction of <HI>Carthage</HI> the <HI>Ro|mans</HI> kept the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Country, and govern'd it under their Procon&s;uls for many Ages: Trade receiving no encouragement from them, as I have ob&s;erv'd already, took a new turn and ran in &s;everal Chanels, <HI>(viz.)</HI> from <HI>Egypt,</HI> by way of <HI>Alexandria</HI> to <HI>Mar&s;eilles,</HI> and afterwards to <HI>Venice</HI> and <HI>Genoa,</HI> and from the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> coming thither, by way of the River <HI>Oxus</HI> to <HI>Erzirum,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Taprezond,</HI> and thence by the
<PB N="134" REF="146">
<HI>Enxine</HI> and <HI>Aegean</HI> Seas to <HI>Corinth;</HI> which there|upon reviv'd a little, till that part too was &s;wallow'd up by the <HI>Geneo&s;es,</HI> and the <HI>Vevetians,</HI> and with them it remain'd.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Africa,</HI> Tho' <HI>Carthage</HI> was rebuilt, and the Country continu'd extreamly rich, populous, and powerful, to the time of <HI>Ju&s;tinian,</HI> and la|ter; yet <HI>Africa</HI> never fell into Trade other than, as I have &s;aid, the exporting Corn and Cop|per, Wax and Salt, which was in it&s;elf no great matter.</P>
<P>BUT when the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire declin'd the <HI>Vandals,</HI> the <HI>Goths,</HI> and at length the <HI>Saracens,</HI> over run this whole Country; and as the <HI>Maho|metans</HI> wherever they came rather laid the World wa&s;te than cultivated and improv'd it; &s;o here from a peopled, improved, rich, cultivated Soil, a populous, well planted Country, full of large Cities and Towns, and of a rich and thriving People, they brought it to be a wild uninhabited De&s;art, the Inland part left to mere Nature, and the Sea-coa&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;t by Barbarians, and a Genera|tion of Drones, who declining the hone&s;t Indu&s;try, which makes the World rich, and encourages Arts and Peace, cho&s;e to live by Rapine and Violence; and from this principle turn'd Pirates and High-Sea Robbers: And thus from a beginning up|wards of 500 Years old ever &s;ince their being ex|pel'd out of <HI>Spain,</HI> they have continued in &s;e|veral Tribes and Nations, and under &s;everal Denominations to this Day; &s;uch as the <HI>Moors</HI> of <HI>Sallee,</HI> Subjects to the King or Emperors of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco;</HI> the <HI>Turks</HI> of <HI>Algiers</HI> and <HI>Tu|nis,</HI> and the <HI>Arabians,</HI> for &s;uch they were, of <HI>Tripoli</HI> and <HI>Barca.</HI></P>
<P>THESE wretched crews of Thieves, from low and &s;mall beginnings, but encourag'd by Succe&s;s, have gradually encreas'd at the expence
<PB N="135" REF="147">
of the trading Chri&s;tian Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> whom they have always prey'd upon, till they are grown up to the height of power and &s;trength which we &s;ee them arriv'd to at this Time, when they are call'd a Government, nay are treated with as Nations, Common-wealths, and States, Regencies, or what el&s;e they plea&s;e to call them|&s;elves, to the reproach of Chri&s;tendom, and to the infinite lo&s;s and di&s;couragement of the Merchants and Navigators of all the Nations about them.</P>
<P>HERE therefore, craving leave to make a Tran&s;ition from the &s;ucce&s;s of Trade, and the advancing of di&s;covery and improvement in Commerce, of which I have hitherto &s;poken hi&s;|torically; I &s;ay, I &s;hall make a brief Tran&s;i|tion to the ruinous condition of this flouri&s;h|ing part of the World call'd <HI>Africa,</HI> how 'tis abandon'd and for&s;aken of its old and indu&s;tri|ous Inhabitants, and is become a Den, not of Lions and Tigers only, the ordinary Inhabi|tants of the inland Mountains, but of Pirates and Thieves, a kind of wild Bea&s;ts infinitely more de&s;tructive to the World, and wor&s;e Ene|mies to its pro&s;perity than the mo&s;t ravenous Bea&s;ts of Prey in <HI>Nubia,</HI> or <HI>Libya,</HI> or the banks of the River <HI>Niger,</HI> which runs thro' the mo&s;t de&s;olate Country in the World.</P>
<P>HOW the <HI>Africans</HI> at this time live, how they grow every Day more &s;avage and more untractable than before, and how at la&s;t they may, if not prevented, become more dan|gerous than when they po&s;&s;e&s;t all the King|dom of <HI>Spain,</HI> wou'd take up too much time and is al&s;o be&s;ide my purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT how they might be reduc'd; how either brought to the exerci&s;e of Arts and Indu&s;try, and be made a Ble&s;&s;ing to the World; or how

conquer'd, extirpated, and the Country clear'd of them, and the Country re&s;tor'd to the flou|ri&s;hing, thriving, and trading Figure which it formerly made in the World, or perhaps a greater, to the advantage, not of the Inhabitants only, but of all the Chri&s;tian Nations near them: This, as it belongs to future improvement in Trade, and future di&s;covery, is exactly within the bounds of my Undertaking.</P>
<P>I HAVE done therefore with dull Antiquity, as to Trade; and tho' it is true I could not call this Work a Hi&s;tory; if in di&s;cour&s;ing of the&s;e great periods in Commerce, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the ruin of <HI>Tyre</HI> and <HI>Carthage,</HI> after which, Trade receiv'd &s;uch Shocks, that after them it ran always in other Chanels; I &s;ay, tho' I could not call it a Hi&s;tory unle&s;s I had gone back to the beginning of things; and that I hope it has not been an unprofitable Work: So now I &s;hall enter ac|cording to my Title into a &s;hort account of the Rea&s;on and Mea&s;ures for recovering this lo&s;t part of the World, and re&s;toring it to its antient Glory, I mean, as to Trade only to the infinite advantage of its &s;elf, and of <HI>Europe</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>IF the Trade of <HI>Africa</HI> was once &s;o very advan|tagious; if the Country was once &s;o fruitful; the Nations in it &s;o powerful and populous; the Product of it &s;o rich and valuable, Why &s;hou'd it not be re&s;tored to its former Condition, that we in the&s;e Parts of the World might reap at lea&s;t our &s;hare of the benefit of it? This is the Que&s;tion I am next to &s;peak to.</P>

<P>THE King of <HI>Fez</HI> and <HI>Morocco</HI> are able, bring|ing Tag and Rag together, to draw out into the Field a very great Army; they tell us, if they join Forces, they may bring together $20000 Men; and this I am to grant, for Argument &s;ake, whether I believe it or no, and the rather be|cau&s;e when the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Lede,</HI> the late <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> General, landed at <HI>Ceuta,</HI> with an Army, in the Year 1722, the <HI>Moors</HI> appear'd with a great Ar|my, and attack'd him in his Entrenchments with &s;uch ob&s;tinacy and fury, that notwith&s;tanding they were repuls'd with great Slaughter; yet the <HI>Spaniards</HI> thought fit to give over the Enterprize, and return to old <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>BUT tho&s;e People who make this an Objecti|on &s;hou'd not forget at the &s;ame time, that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were but 12000 Men; that the Sea&s;on of the Year was advanc'd, and they wanted Provi&s;ions;

<P N="1">I.

<P><HI>CHARLES</HI> the Fifth, ju&s;tly call'd the Great, &s;aw into the rea&s;on, ju&s;tice, and nece&s;&s;i|ty of this; and as he was a mo&s;t magnanimous as well as a politic and under&s;tanding Prince, he apply'd him&s;elf very &s;eriou&s;ly to the Work, and made two powerful Expeditions on purpo&s;e; the fir&s;t &s;ucceeded gloriou&s;ly, and he took the City of <HI>Tunis,</HI> with the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Goletto,</HI> and in effect the whole Kingdom of <HI>Tunis;</HI> the &s;econd, again&s;t <HI>Algier,</HI> mi&s;carried; by rea&s;on of a terrible Tempe&s;t which &s;catter'd and de&s;troy'd great part of his Fleet, and he return'd with lo&s;s; but this was unavoidable, and the like might ea&s;ily be prevent|ed. But even this &s;hews, that great and generous Princes have formerly thought this Work worthy their undertaking; that it is not done, if it is from Heaven, is a Judgment upon the Chri&s;tian World for the Omi&s;&s;ion; and if it is not attempt|ed they will always, like the <HI>Canaanites</HI> in the Land, be left there for Goads in our Sides; only let us remember the <HI>I&s;raelites</HI> were always blam'd for not de&s;troying the &s;aid <HI>Canaanites,</HI> and for leaving one of them alive; and this is a Sum|mons to me to &s;peak to another Objection, tho' not mention'd before; namely, What right have we or any of the Chri&s;tian Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> to invade and di&s;po&s;e&s;s the&s;e People, who however they came by their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, have enjoy'd them by &s;o long a pre&s;cription, as namely, about or a|bove a thou&s;and Years, that if we look back &s;o many Ages into any of the Chri&s;tian Nations we &s;peak of, we may find our right to the Country we live in, as ill founded perhaps as the&s;e; that it is not &s;ufficient to &s;ay they are <HI>Mahometans,</HI>
<PB N="146" REF="158">
and not Chri&s;tians; for then we have a right to make War upon and de&s;troy all the Heathen Na|tions of the World, which I do not take to be ju&s;t?</P>
<P>TO this I an&s;wer, That there is &s;omething &s;pe|cious in the Objection, yet there is as clear and undeniable an Argument to be u&s;ed for the ju&s;tice of the attempt as can be de&s;ir'd in the World; and it is form'd in a ju&s;t di&s;tinction between the People as they are Men, and the People as they practi&s;e and behave. We do not execute a Murderer becau&s;e he was a Man, and had ability or courage to commit the Murder, but as he was a Criminal, a Man&s;layer, and had &s;hed innocent Blood.</P>
<P>SO let the <HI>Moors</HI> and <HI>Turks</HI> of <HI>Salee, Algier,</HI> and <HI>Tunis,</HI> and <HI>Tripoli,</HI> apply them&s;elves in a peacable manner by hone&s;t Labour, or Commerce, to cul|tivate the Earth, and live on the hone&s;t Fruits of their Labour, I had nothing to &s;ay; a-God's-Name let them enjoy and peacably dwell in the Land, and we might trade with them, as well as we do with their fellow Infidels at <HI>Con&s;tantinople, Smyr|na, Aleppo,</HI> and other places; for this Quarrel does not lye again&s;t them as Men, nor as <HI>Turks</HI> and <HI>Mahometans.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Quarrel at them is, as they are Thieves, Robbers, and Murderers, and as &s;uch they both may and ought to be &s;uppre&s;s'd, and 'tis the reproach of Chri&s;tendom that they are not.</P>
<P>TO make this evident, it wou'd be &s;ufficient to advance, that the Chri&s;tian Nations &s;hou'd in ca&s;e of &s;uch a War, only drive them off fifteen or twen|ty Miles from the Sea-coa&s;ts; there is Country enough for them all, to &s;pread them&s;elves as far as they plea&s;e; but I think they have done enough to <HI>Europe</HI> for &s;o many hundred Years together to

<P>THIS I think takes away all pretence of ob|jection again&s;t the ju&s;tice and lawfulne&s;s of attack|ing tho&s;e People; for let them live hone&s;tly and indu&s;triou&s;ly by Labour or Commerce, or any how, &s;o as not to oppre&s;s or wrong the re&s;t of the World, and we have nothing to &s;ay.</P>
<P>BUT as they will never do that, as long as they have Ships, and Guns, and Men to go a robbing; I think it is but ju&s;t they &s;hou'd be at lea&s;t remov'd from the Sea-&s;hore, and be &s;uffer'd no more to &s;et a Sail or row with an Oar upon the Sea: Nor can this be unju&s;t on this account, 1. They have done &s;ufficient to forfeit the Seas, that is, the privilege of &s;ailing upon the Water, as long as they have a Name on the Earth, or at lea&s;t as Nations. And <HI>Secondly,</HI> They are able to give no other &s;ufficient &s;ecurity for their Beha|viour than that of entirely quitting the Coa&s;t, giving up their Ships, and being allow'd to have no more Ships or Boats to make u&s;e of.</P>
<P>HOW ea&s;y wou'd this be, if the <HI>European</HI> Pow+ers were but once re&s;olv'd to unite their Forces for the attempt; nor won'd it be an Expedition that wou'd call for all their Forces, no nor for the twentieth part of their Forces, if they thought fit to make an Experiment; and how gloriou&s;ly wou'd it reward their Labour?</P>

<P>BUT all this you will &s;ay does not reach the Ca&s;e; the Objection is laid from another Diffi|culty; namely, Whether it wou'd be po&s;&s;ible that the Nations cou'd agree about the divi&s;ion of their Conque&s;ts when they were made? that they wou'd fall together by the Ears about Shares, and by envyings and jarring Intere&s;ts ruin the Undertak+ing, and leave the <HI>Turks</HI> Victorious, and more In|&s;olent than they were before.</P>
<P>IF this were really true it wou'd be very &s;ad and the mi&s;carriage wou'd lye heavy; but I do
<PB N="151" REF="163">
not &s;ee that this mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily follow; for if by a Treaty enter'd upon before, it &s;hou'd be adju&s;ted what particular part each Nation &s;hou'd attack, and &s;o go on in &s;eparate Bodies; tho' all &s;hou'd fall on together, it might be ea&s;y to allot every Nation what part they &s;hou'd po&s;&s;e&s;s, by appoint|ing each Nation to conquer for them&s;elves.</P>
<P>OR if it was found rea&s;onable to join the Forces of two or more Nations together, yet they might enter into mutual Guarantee with one another to &s;et a-part the de&s;ign'd Countries to the u&s;e of tho&s;e to whom they were &s;o allotted by agree|ment; and to give them up peaceably, all the Confederates joining to enforce the execution of &s;uch a Treaty, when the War was over; or to de|clare War again&s;t the particular Nation or Power that &s;hou'd refu&s;e it.</P>
<P>CURIOSITY now might lead the Reader to de&s;ire me to enter into particulars, and to lay down a Scheme how I wou'd have them &s;hare this <HI>Bear-skin;</HI> but I think, tho' 'tis ea&s;y in it&s;elf, it wou'd be too a&s;&s;uming and arrogant in an Under|taking of this kind; then as here is a va&s;tly extend|ed Coa&s;t, &s;uch as wou'd be &s;ufficient for all Pre|tenders to it; I may turn it all into a Suppo&s;ition, and let the Reader dige&s;t it for him&s;elf.</P>
<P>SUPPOSE then, That each Nation in the <HI>Medi|terranean</HI> had allotted them all and as much of the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> as lay right again&s;t them|&s;elves; the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> what is over again&s;t <HI>Spain,</HI> which by the way wou'd be the large&s;t part; the <HI>French,</HI> what is over-again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> the King of <HI>Sardinia,</HI> the part oppo&s;ite to <HI>Sici|ly,</HI> the <HI>Malte&s;es</HI> joining with him, and the <HI>Sicili|ans,</HI> the <HI>Venetians,</HI> and <HI>Neapolitans,</HI> all the Ea&s;t part from <HI>Tripoli</HI> to <HI>Alexandria,</HI> with all they could &s;eparately &s;eize upon and &s;upport; then

<HEAD>CHAP. XIII. <HI>Of the &s;top of Trade at the de&s;truction of</HI> Car|thage. <HI>How Silk Worms came fir&s;t to be known in</HI> Italy; <HI>and how the Woollen Ma|nufactures were fir&s;t Invented and &s;et on Foot in the World.</HI></HEAD>
<P>WE have now brought Trade to a full &s;top in the World; Commerce, like a Boat a Drift, was lo&s;t, and left as it were rolling upon the Water without a <HI>Rudder,</HI> an <HI>Oar,</HI> or a <HI>Sail;</HI> all its parts were di&s;located, and &s;carce the name of Commerce was left in the World. The Merchants which were left, were de&s;titute of Corre&s;pondencies; the buying part of the World de&s;titute of Manufac|tures; Natures produce, which is the principle of all Manufacturing, was de&s;titute of a Market; Goods made could not be &s;old, Goods wanted could not be found, Nece&s;&s;ity was brought to put Invention upon the Rack, in order to form (as the Doctors call it, &s;ome new <HI>Materia Medica)</HI> a new Sy&s;tem of Trade, and new &s;ub&s;tance of Materials, to &s;et the World to work upon.</P>
<P>THE Original of all Manufacture, and (in tho&s;e times, which I have been treating of) the only Materials then known, for manufacturing, were SILK and HAIR, COTTON and FLAX, This is plain from all kinds of antient Writers, and from the product of tho&s;e Countries, at this time.</P>
<P N="1"><PB N="154" REF="167">
I. SILK. The rich Man was cloathed in Purple, it &s;eems he coveted to be &s;een in gorgeous Apparel, which could be no other than &s;uch as the <HI>Baby|loni&s;h Garment</HI> was, that <HI>Achan</HI> &s;tole, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Silk embroider'd with Gold and Silver, and various colours of other Silk.</P>
<P N="2">II. FLAX. Fine Linen of <HI>Egypt,</HI> was then very well known, and the Prie&s;ts Ve&s;tments were either of &s;uch fine Linen (as the Ephod in par|ticular) or of Silk.</P>
<P N="3">III. COTTON. For I make no doubt, as the Women were, and wou'd be cloathed richly too as well as the Men; &s;o, they not being able in tho&s;e warm Countries, to wear heavy Clothing, contented them&s;elves as with the rich Atle&s;&s;es, and flower'd Silks; &s;o with the light painted Chints, and fine <HI>Ma&s;slapatans,</HI> &amp;c. of <HI>Bengal,</HI> and <HI>Golconda,</HI> and all the Callicoes of the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> that part between the <HI>Ganges,</HI> and the <HI>Indus;</HI> and which were brought into <HI>Europe,</HI> either by the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> to <HI>Sues,</HI> and <HI>Alexandria,</HI> or by the Caravans to <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Smyrna.</HI></P>
<P>BUT <HI>Corinth</HI> being ruin'd on one hand, and <HI>Carthage</HI> the Year after on the other; by which two Cities the whole Wealth of the <HI>Indies</HI> circula|ted, there was a full &s;top of that Trade; nor did it ever &s;ee it&s;elf fully re&s;tor'd. For,</P>
<P N="1">I. <HI>EUROPE,</HI> (by which I mean the Inhabitants of <HI>Europe)</HI> applying them&s;elves with great vigor to Trade, it was not many Years before (e&s;pe|cially in <HI>Italy)</HI> they found the method of get|ting the Silk unwrought from the Coa&s;t of the <HI>Ca&s;pian Sea,</HI> and learned to manufacture it in
<PB N="155" REF="168">
their own Countries; and within a few Ages more, they found means to bring over the very Species, <HI>(viz.)</HI> the Worms, which produced tho&s;e Silks, and the Mulberry Trees which fed them, and which together was the very Blood of the Commerce, and &s;o made it appear they cou'd naturalize both to the&s;e <HI>European</HI> Cli|mates; and that in time they wou'd have no more need to go to <HI>India</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> for Cloth|ing their People, but would be able in a few Years to make the Trade &s;ub&s;i&s;t at home, and cloath them&s;elves by the product of their own Climate, and the labour of their own Hands.</P>
<P>THE effect of this was, That <HI>Italy</HI> (that is) the South part of <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>Sicily,</HI> &s;upplying Silk, and the adjacent Country of <HI>Lombardy,</HI> namely, the Duchies of <HI>Milan</HI> and <HI>Mantua,</HI> furni&s;hing innume|rable Hands to manufacture tho&s;e Silks, the Trade between <HI>Europe</HI> and <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> (that is, <HI>Per&s;ia, Georgia,</HI> and <HI>India)</HI> died away; as far as related to wrought Silks, and Manufactures of Cotton and Hair, &amp;c. and in a few Years more was wholy confin'd to the Trade of Spices, Gums, and Drugs, which continued to be brought to <HI>Sues,</HI> in the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> and from thence to <HI>Alexandria;</HI> which Trade the <HI>Venetians</HI> and the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> &s;har'd between them, as &s;hall be &s;een in its place; and as for the Silks, they were &s;o far from wanting them, that the <HI>Italians,</HI> for many Ages, out-did the <HI>Per&s;ians</HI> and <HI>Indians,</HI> and abundantly &s;upplyed them&s;elves, and all <HI>Europe,</HI> with wrought Silks, without &s;o much as thinking any more of <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>India.</HI></P>
<P>THUS &s;tood the Commerce of <HI>Europe,</HI> for &s;ome Ages, after the fir&s;t decay of the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade, by the de&s;truction of <HI>Corinth</HI> and <HI>Carthage.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> troubled them&s;elves not, as a State, and in their politic Capacity, with matters of
<PB N="156" REF="169">
Commerce; nor do I find, except what related to &s;upplying the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and the Country ad|jacent with Corn, any one Act of the Senate, or Edict of any Emperor, for the directing, regu|lating, or encouraging Commerce, or Manufac|tures, under the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Government, from the time of the de&s;truction of <HI>Carthage,</HI> to the time of <HI>Ju&s;tinian the Great,</HI> that is to &s;ay, for above 900 Years.</P>
<P>TRADE was left, as I have &s;aid, to its own Fate; Merchandizing went forward, as the Mer|chants of tho&s;e times thought fit to act, every one in the narrow Circle, or Sphere of his own views, traded this way or that way, as they pleas'd.</P>
<P>I KNOW they tell us of Fleets of Ships, in the <HI>Romans</HI> time, which went to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and return'd again into the <HI>Red Sea;</HI> that is to &s;ay, to the Gulph of <HI>Sues,</HI> upon the Northern Shore, or point of that Sea; but we read little of what they brought. 'Tis certain, that after <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s time, when as I &s;aid, the Citizens of <HI>Naples</HI> fetch|ing only the Silk from <HI>Per&s;ia,</HI> began to manufac|ture their own Goods; I &s;ay, from that time the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Ships brought home little but the Spices and Callicoes of <HI>India,</HI> leaving the wrought Silks of <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> behind, as what the <HI>Romans</HI> were well enough furni&s;h'd with at home.</P>
<P>THUS continued the Affairs of Trade during the time of the <HI>Roman</HI> Grandeur; for then, <HI>Rome</HI> being Mi&s;tre&s;s of the World, <HI>Italy</HI> was the cen|ter of its Commerce; and having above &s;ix Millions and a half of People in it, the &s;up|plying them with but every one a yard of Linen, and every one a yard of Silk, was enough to have &s;et all the Weavers in <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia</HI> at Work.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="170">
BUT <HI>Italy</HI> is a warm Climate, and as it &s;tands ju&s;t where it did, it is to be &s;uppos'd the Climate was as hot then as it is now; and this occa&s;ion'd the People, both Men and Women, to go as thin cloth'd as they could; nay it was complain'd in <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Reign, that the Ladies Clothing, leav|ing the Neck and Brea&s;ts, down to the Stomach, quite bare; and the Legs, above the Knee, in part &s;o too, the loo&s;e Robe being button'd up upon the Thigh; the re&s;t of the Body clothed with thin Lawns and Crapes (next to a fine Mu&s;lin) lay &s;o clo&s;e to the Body that the parts were all di&s;tin|gui&s;h'd thro' the covering, and it was but a civiler kind of going naked, when all the Shapes of the Body were delineated, even thro' the &s;hade of the Habit. This loo&s;e way of Dre&s;&s;ing the <HI>Ro|man Virtuo&s;i</HI> exclaim'd at very often, as done to excite Lewdne&s;s; and <HI>Juvenal</HI> often Expo&s;tulates with the <HI>Roman</HI> Ladies about it: But that is foreign to my purpo&s;e, except thus far, namely; It proves that the Trade from <HI>India</HI> of fine Mu&s;lins, and fine Callicoes, and <HI>Chints,</HI> fully &s;up|ply'd the demand of <HI>Italy</HI> for a long time with Clothing, e&s;pecially for the Ladies; as to the Robes of the Men, the <HI>Toga,</HI> or loo&s;e Mantle, which the Men wore; that was &s;upplyed with a dif|fering and remote Manufacture; namely, to tho&s;e who could &s;upport the expence of it, <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Indian</HI> wrought Silks made the Ve&s;t; and the Robe was fine Damask, and others follow'd their ex|ample, where they could come up to the wear; for the re&s;t &s;everal kinds of Cotton Stuffs, and Camb|lets made of Goats and Camels Hair, &s;uch as they made u&s;e of for many Ages after, and &s;uch as they make u&s;e of in tho&s;e Countries to this Day; &s;ome of which may be tho&s;e we call <HI>Turkey</HI> Burdets, and are &s;till call'd by the Name of <HI>Turkey</HI> Stuffs of what kind &s;oever.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="171">
THE Poor had their different Clothing, as the Poor have in all Nations; and by degrees, the Silk being too dear in the Materials as well as Workman&s;hip, and Cotton being fetch'd too far to come to a rea&s;onable price; I &s;ay, by degrees they began to make u&s;e of the Wooll from the Back of the Sheep, to make cour&s;e Garments for the Poor, and to give them relief again&s;t the In|clemencies of the Sea&s;ons, as well Heat as Cold; and even in this they found them&s;elves out-done by the <HI>Vandals,</HI> the <HI>Goths,</HI> and the other barba|rous Nations; which in the &s;everal declining Years of their Empire made Excur&s;ions from their frozen Mountains into the &s;ofter and warmer Climates of <HI>Italy.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN tho&s;e wild People, e&s;pecially the <HI>He|ruli,</HI> and the <HI>Sarmatians,</HI> who came out of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> the Upper <HI>Hungary</HI> and <HI>Au&s;tria;</HI> and more e&s;pecially the <HI>Vandals,</HI> who came from the frozen Shores of the <HI>Baltick,</HI> and the Countries about <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> and <HI>Pomerania;</HI> I &s;ay, when the&s;e People came down, they found their Princes and Generals dre&s;s'd up in co&s;tly Furs, the Sables and Ermines, the Beavers and Foxes Skins of the Northern Climates; their Hor&s;es were cover'd, (and which &s;erv'd them for Saddles and Hou&s;ings) with the Skins of Bears and Ounxes, Buffalloes, Rain Deer, Stags, and the like.</P>
<P>THE Soldiers had their clothing of Skins al&s;o, but of meaner &s;orts; &s;uch as the Hare, the Coney, the Badger, the Otter, the Sheep, and the Lamb; of which the Fur, or Wooll, being inward, as well as outward, they were exceeding warm, and not to be endur'd when they march'd &s;o far as <HI>Italy,</HI> where they &s;oon learnt to cloath them|&s;elves with the Spoils of the Country, and often left their riche&s;t Furs behind them, e&s;pecially if being beaten, as they were frequently by the
<PB N="159" REF="172">
<HI>Romans,</HI> they were oblig'd to leave their Bones behind them too, &s;ometimes two or three hundred thou&s;and at a time.</P>
<P>PROCESS of time however, mended things with tho&s;e Northern People; and whereas at fir&s;t they came down cloath'd with the Skins of wild and ravenous Bea&s;ts, them&s;elves more &s;avage, wild, and ravenous than the Bea&s;ts who&s;e badges they wore; &s;o in a few Ages the <HI>Romans</HI> per|ceived the Wooll of the Sheep, in&s;tead of being worn on the Backs of the poor Soldiers rough upon the Skin, and the Skin perhaps with no other dre&s;&s;ing than being dryed in the Sun; I &s;ay, they perceiv'd the Wooll taken off from the Skin woven and manufactur'd into a different &s;pecies of Garments, call'd Cloth of Wooll, or Woollen; and tho' this at fir&s;t might be about as good as our Rugs, Duffels, and Blankets, or perhaps not &s;o good; they fitted the purpo&s;es for which they were de&s;ign'd, and &s;erv'd not only to accommodate the People, but even to make them proud of the Habit: Thus we find in &s;ome of the de|&s;criptions of the antient Northern <HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Bri|tains,</HI> that their Habit was a Rug, with Tags or Thrumbs of Wooll hanging down on the out&s;ide, the &s;ame as we frequently find &s;ome Gentlemen affect to wear now, not for nece&s;&s;ity, but in af|fectation and mimickry to look a little &s;avage and barbarous; as if any thing that look'd wild and mountanous was a Beauty to them, and could pa&s;s for Ornaments, becau&s;e they thought fit to make u&s;e of them; But the humours of a time, and of a few, is not worth a Digre&s;&s;ion; 'tis enough to tell us what was the gro&s;s beginning of that we now call the Woollen Manufacture. In all tho&s;e antient Ages of the World, <HI>Egypt</HI> carry'd on a mighty Trade in the Linen Manufacture, and <HI>fine Linen of Egypt</HI> was the greate&s;t rarity
<PB N="160" REF="173">
of the World of the kind; and this, with the va&s;t plenty of Corn that always grew there, made <HI>Egypt</HI> Rich; for <HI>Egypt</HI> ever &s;ince the time of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and his Brethren, was the Granary of the World for Corn: It is true Corn is a Product, not a Manufacture, a Supply on Occa&s;ion to any Country, not a Commerce, but Linen was their Wealth, their main and chief Employ, a national Bu&s;ine&s;s, the Manufacture of the Country, and on which &s;he chiefly depended. This we may rea&s;onably conjecture was the Rea&s;on of the place being &s;o infinitely and incredibly populous; in&s;o|much that they tell us when <HI>Nebuchadnezzar,</HI> af|ter his di&s;appointment in the taking of <HI>Tyre,</HI> in|vaded and took <HI>Egypt,</HI> there were then twenty thou&s;and Towns in it; &s;ome of which were great and populous Cities, and e&s;pecially one, &s;uppos'd to be the <HI>Memphis</HI> of the Antients, as immen&s;ly great as they &s;ay Grand <HI>Cairo</HI> is now, and had &s;ix or &s;even Millions of People in it, with the va&s;t Wealth, of which, when the <HI>Babylonian</HI> King plunder'd it, be&s;ides enriching his whole Army, and as &s;ome &s;ay, his whole Empire, I &s;ay, with that overplus Wealth he built or ca&s;t that mon|&s;trous Idol which he &s;et up in the Plains of <HI>Dura,</HI> in the Province of <HI>Babylon,</HI> and which was all of Ma&s;&s;y Gold; the dimen&s;ions of which are de&s;cribed, <HI>Dan.</HI> iii. 1. <HI>The height &s;ixty Cubits, and breadth &s;ix Cubits,</HI> or, to allow a Foot and half to each Cubit, it was ninety Foot high, and nine Foot thick, being (to bring it down to vulgar Appre|hen&s;ion) near half as high as our Monument; all, I &s;ay, of Gold: What the &s;hape of it was, we know the Scripture is &s;ilent in, but Authors gene|rally agree, that like the <HI>Collo&s;&s;us</HI> at <HI>Rhodes,</HI> it was in the figure of a Man.</P>
<P>THIS infinite Number of People in <HI>Egypt,</HI> and the exceeding Wealth of that Country, is not

at all improbable, were drawn together by Com|merce; and the whole Commerce of the Country in all tho&s;e early Days was in fine Linen, Purple, and Blue, Embroidery, and &s;uch nice Works of the Needle, <HI>Ezekiel</HI> xxvii. 7. <HI>Fine Linen, with embroidered Work from</HI> Egypt; and again ver&s;e 16. <HI>Purple, and embroidered Work, and fine Linen from</HI> Syria; and we all know that <HI>Syria</HI> is the next Country adjoyning to <HI>Egypt,</HI> and was then under <HI>Pharaoh</HI>'s Dominion; and again ver&s;e 27. <HI>Blue Cloths, and embroidered Works, and Che&s;ts of rich Apparel, from</HI> Sheba <HI>and</HI> A&s;hur; the&s;e were Countries in <HI>Arabia,</HI> ju&s;t oppo&s;ite to <HI>Egypt,</HI> on the <HI>Red Sea.</HI></P>
<P>THIS &s;hews us what a place of Trade <HI>Egypt</HI> was, for Manufactures; and that by the&s;e Manu|factures they became &s;o prodigiou&s;ly Populous; for Manufactures bring Trade, and Trade di&s;|per&s;es, that is, con&s;umes the Manufacture, and both bring numbers of People together; nor does it appear that any Kingdom in the World was ever extreamly Populous but by the efficiency of Trade, except <HI>Italy</HI> and <HI>India;</HI> and for tho&s;e particular exceptions we may rea&s;onably make Allowances, &s;ince their Governments are &s;o publickly known, one happening by the immediate di&s;po&s;ition of Heaven, and the other being occa&s;ion'd by its be|ing the center of the great Empire of the World.</P>
<P>ALL the other great and populous Countries in the World, have been made &s;o by Commerce, and by Manufactures, and by the&s;e only; as <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> once the mo&s;t populous &s;pot of Ground in the World, and &s;till continuing extreamly full of large Cities, and Towns, and People; it was then the &s;eat of the <HI>Teutonick Knights,</HI> and <HI>Hans-Men,</HI> the great Patrons of Trade; the only, and perhaps fir&s;t Merchants of <HI>Europe,</HI> of whom I &s;hall &s;peak in their turn: They were fir&s;t call'd <HI>E&s;terlings,</HI> and

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV. <HI>Of the &s;everal new Di&s;coveries and Improve|ments which were made in the World under the</HI> Roman <HI>Government, after the overthrow of the</HI> Carthaginians, <HI>but e&s;pecially after the declining &s;tate of the</HI> Roman <HI>Empire.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I MUST now go back a little again to mention the other parts of my Work, and according to my Title, to &s;peak of the Article ranged under New Di&s;covery.</P>
<P>THAT Learning flouri&s;h'd under the <HI>Roman Government</HI> is not to be deny'd; that the <HI>Romans</HI> civiliz'd the World, and brought the barbarous Nations not only to &s;ubmit to Government but
<PB N="164" REF="177">
the regularity of that Government, and the equity of their Laws made the People ea&s;y, their Per|&s;ons and Properties &s;afe; and in con&s;equence of that Safety and Liberty the People were en|courag'd to Arts, Indu&s;try, and Learning; in a Word, every thing receiv'd Encouragment under the <HI>Roman</HI> Admini&s;tration <HI>but Trade.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, they did not particularly oppre&s;s Trade, or di&s;courage the People from it, except, that indeed &s;ometimes their Taxes were heavy, and Impo&s;itions of Conquerors always di&s;courage the Merchant; for the Sword too often reaps the Harve&s;t of the indu&s;trious Merchant; but even in that part, the <HI>Roman</HI> Government was as mode|rate as their Circum&s;tances wou'd admit.</P>
<P>BUT here lay the difference; It is not enough to the planting and e&s;tabli&s;hing Com|merce, that a Government &s;hou'd not openly di&s;courage it; but Trade and new Di&s;covery mu&s;t be the nur&s;ery and darling of the Govern|ment they live under; the Merchant mu&s;t receive the countenance and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Govern|ment he lives under, or Trade never ri&s;es with ad|vantage.</P>
<P>COMMERCE receiv'd a mortal blow in the de&s;truction of <HI>Carthage;</HI> the whole World felt the &s;hock; as their Di&s;coveries abroad lately begun, &s;unk and were de&s;troy'd in the general di&s;&s;a&s;ter, for want of Supplies; &s;o Invention, u&s;eful Un|dertakings, Arts, Science, all which were flou|ri&s;hing and encrea&s;ing at home under the <HI>Cartha|ginian</HI> Government, were likewi&s;e overwelm'd in it, and all the Manufactures &s;unk with it, as no doubt many were on foot, among a People who&s;e Genius addicted them to encourage Manufacture and employ their People: All were overwhelm'd in the general Ruin; the Mines of Copper, and Iron, and even of Silver, in many Countries
<PB N="165" REF="178">
were left unwrought, and the Iron in particular in <HI>Africa</HI> was never thorowly recover'd to this Day; nor has the manufacturing the Iron, which flouri&s;h'd particularly in <HI>Carthage,</HI> for the mak|ing Armour, Weapons, and all the needful Uten|&s;ils of War, in which the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> excel'd all the World, ever been re&s;tor'd to <HI>Africa</HI> to this Day.</P>
<P>IN a Word, all the trading World felt the blow; and we find nothing con&s;iderable done in Manufacture, or Inventions, relating to Trade, after the fall of <HI>Carthage,</HI> for many Ages: Let us &s;ee however what progre&s;s was made in other things; and how the World came gradually to the knowledge of one another.</P>
<P>DISCOVERIES for Trade were not made indeed, but Di&s;coveries were made for all that, be the Rea&s;ons of them what they wou'd; for ex|ample, <HI>Carthage</HI> was de&s;troy'd in the Year of the World 3804, 144. Years before our Saviour was Born. <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI>'s progre&s;s into the North of <HI>Europe</HI> was not till eighty &s;even Years afterwards, being <HI>Anno Mundi</HI> 3891, fifty &s;even Years before Chri&s;t; and tho' it was not a di&s;covery for Com|merce, or a planting for Improvement, but a mere po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing by Armies for extending Conque&s;ts and encrea&s;e of Power; yet this as well as other Conque&s;ts of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> made much about the &s;ame time, brought on the nece&s;&s;ary di&s;coveries of Commerce which have follow'd.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Belgiae,</HI> by which is to be under&s;tood all the Lower <HI>Germany,</HI> were a potent People inhabit|ing the inacce&s;&s;ible Countries of <HI>We&s;tphalia, Ea&s;t-Friezland,</HI> and as much as was then habitable of the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> or <HI>Low Countries;</HI> for the mo&s;t part of tho&s;e Provinces were then rendered not habitable, by the inundations of the many great Rivers, which empty them&s;elves into the
<PB N="166" REF="179">
Ocean at that place; &s;uch as the <HI>We&s;er,</HI> the <HI>Embs,</HI> the <HI>Rhine,</HI> the <HI>Maes,</HI> and the <HI>Scheld,</HI> with many other le&s;&s;er Rivers; which altogether pouring their Waters into this one part, as into a Common-&s;hore, as either by Fre&s;hes and Floods from the Country, or North-We&s;terly Winds, bringing high Tides from the Sea, the Waters were rais'd above their u&s;ual height, all the lower part now call'd <HI>Nether|land,</HI> or the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> were laid under Water like a Sea, and the higher Grounds &s;urrounded, which therefore I call Inacce&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>THOSE People began to be better acquainted with the <HI>Roman</HI> Government after they found that <HI>Great Britain</HI> had &s;ubmitted, and how well they brook'd the Conquerors, and in a few Ages afterwards, the&s;e <HI>Belgiae</HI> became a Province of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire; and as they liv'd among Waters became eminent for their Skill in navigating the mo&s;t boi&s;terous Seas.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till tho&s;e Di&s;coveries added little to the World, in re&s;pect to Commerce, till, after &s;ome Ages, the <HI>Belgiae</HI> began the great Improvement of all, namely, that of the Woollen Manufacture; which however was not, I &s;ay, for &s;ome Ages. But the fir&s;t branch of Improvement, which the&s;e <HI>Low-Countrymen</HI> employ'd them&s;elves in, was re|covering the Land from the inundations of the Sea; and they were a&s;&s;i&s;ted in, if not fir&s;t prompt|ed to it, by the <HI>Romans;</HI> and particularly we find that <HI>Dru&s;us Nero</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> General has the honour of cutting the great Chanel or Canal, which joins the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and the <HI>Y&s;&s;el,</HI> and &s;o upon any occa&s;ion of a Land Flood ca&s;ts off a great part of the Water of the <HI>Rhine</HI> into the <HI>Zuyder,</HI> or the South|ern Sea; by which means all the Country below <HI>Arnheim</HI> as far as <HI>Utrecht</HI> and <HI>Leyden</HI> were eas'd of that va&s;t weight of Water which at &s;ome Sea&s;ons came down the <HI>Rhine,</HI> and like the <HI>Nile,</HI> wou'd
<PB N="167" REF="180">
cover the whole Country, no Dykes or Banks be|ing able to re&s;train them.</P>
<P>THIS Chanel being thus &s;ucce&s;sfully cut, and the effect of it appearing &s;o infinitely advantage|ous to the Country, the example &s;et the &s;everal Princes of the <HI>Belgiae</HI> in their re&s;pective Di&s;tricts or Dominions, upon that noble work, of recovering tho&s;e rich Lands from the con&s;tant inundations of Water which annually overflow'd them, and render'd them u&s;ele&s;s to Mankind, and to &s;hut them in with Banks and Walls built up with im|men&s;e Labour, &s;trengthen'd with va&s;t quantities of Stones and &s;olid Materials fetch'd a great way, and at a prodigious expence, buttre&s;s'd up with Piles and ranges of Piles, driven in &s;ometimes three upon one another; and then making tho&s;e Lands compleatly &s;afe, and laying them dry, tho', as is ob&s;erv'd by Travellers, the whole Sur|face of the Country lyes &s;everal Yards lower than the ordinary Surface of the Water; and this was done with &s;uch Art, and follow'd with &s;uch Application, tho' very gradually, and &s;ome Ages of Years in fini&s;hing, that now we &s;ee two large Governments, Kingdoms we might call them, and two mo&s;t powerful and prodigiou&s;ly popu|lous Nations, namely, the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the <HI>Flemings</HI> living &s;ecurely, and large Cities and Towns flou|ri&s;hing, which were for 4000 Years before delug'd with Water, u&s;ele&s;s and impracticable.</P>
<P>THIS I hope I may be allow'd to call an <HI>Im|provement;</HI> and that this Undertaking was &s;o an|tient, and the fini&s;hing it to &s;ome degree in tho&s;e early times recorded, will appear by the many foundations of royal Cities laid there &s;ince the recovery of tho&s;e Lands; &s;uch as that of <HI>Rotter|dam, Middleburgh, Groninghen, Ghertrugdenburgh,</HI> and innumerable others in <HI>Holland;</HI> al&s;o <HI>Bruges, Gbent, Sluyce, O&s;tend, Neuport,</HI> and even <HI>Ant|werp</HI>
<PB N="168" REF="181">
it&s;elf, and many more on that &s;ide of <HI>Flan|ders.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;everal Improvements of the like nature in other Countries, made after the example of the <HI>Belgiae,</HI> are to be mention'd in their order; as par|ticularly the Triangle or <HI>Delta</HI> of <HI>Egypt,</HI> at the Mouth of the <HI>Nile,</HI> the Mari&s;h of <HI>Martigues</HI> in the <HI>Gallia Narbonen&s;is</HI> at the Mouth of the <HI>Rho&s;n;</HI> the low Land of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> drain'd by <HI>Teutones,</HI> thence call'd the <HI>Teutonick Order,</HI> at the Mouth of the great Rivers <HI>Vi&s;tula,</HI> and of the <HI>Pergle,</HI> and the <HI>Neimen</HI> in <HI>Poland,</HI> the &s;ame in the Fens of <HI>Deit|mar&s;h,</HI> and the Lands upon the <HI>Eyder&s;trom,</HI> on the North-Bank of the <HI>Elb,</HI> in <HI>Hol&s;tein</HI> and <HI>Sle&s;wick;</HI> with innumerable others &s;um'd up in the general Article of the Improvement of Land; which, as it is &s;aid the <HI>Romans</HI> fir&s;t gave the example of; and to &s;um up all, the <HI>Veneti</HI> found the benefit of the like at the decay of the <HI>Roman</HI> State, by which alone they pre&s;erv'd them&s;elves, retreating among the I&s;lands of the <HI>Adriatick</HI> Gulph, and the drown'd Lands between the Mouths of the <HI>Po,</HI> and near the Influx of the <HI>Adige,</HI> and &s;everal other Rivers; where draining and &s;ecuring tho&s;e Lands from the inundation of the Rivers, they at the &s;ame time fortify'd them&s;elves again&s;t the attacks of the <HI>Heruli;</HI> and afterwards of all the barbarous Na|tions which over-run the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire.</P>
<P>THIS is but a brief Hi&s;tory of a long &s;eries of Time; but as a Hi&s;tory of Improvement is a part of this Work; and this is the beginning of all Im|provement in the World, in the &s;ence of the Que&s;tion; &s;o I think it is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable thing of its kind, and as it is what we &s;ee the effect of every Day before our Eyes, we cannot think it &s;o remote as other In&s;tances might.</P>
<P>HAD not this piece of Improvement been made we had known no States of the <HI>United Pro|vinces;</HI>
<PB N="169" REF="182">
no <HI>Au&s;trian Netherlands;</HI> nor had we heard of all the famous things done, and Men concern'd in the two mo&s;t fatal Wars of the World, and which la&s;ted (but with &s;mall intervals) above forty Years each; I mean the War between the <HI>Dutch</HI> and the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> when the former began to be a free State; and the late War be|tween <HI>France</HI> and the Confederates, in which Liberty was effectually re&s;tor'd to all the op|pre&s;s'd Nations, and <HI>Europe</HI> may be &s;aid to become one free People.</P>
<P>IT is mo&s;t certain, that the Progre&s;s of <HI>Julius Cae&s;ar</HI> into <HI>Britain,</HI> and into the Northern Provin|ces of the <HI>Gauls</HI> and <HI>Germans,</HI> was to the <HI>Romans</HI> as the planting <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Virginia</HI> was to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> I mean a <HI>New Di&s;covery;</HI> with this difference only, that they planted for Conque&s;t, we planted for Commerce; they planted to extend their Dominion, we to extend our Trade; and as the la&s;t is the be&s;t Foundation, &s;o it is the &s;ure&s;t Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, and will certainly continue longe&s;t; experience tells us &s;o, witne&s;s the long continu|ance of the Colonies and Nations here in <HI>Britain,</HI> and in the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> notwith&s;tanding the fall of their Lords and Di&s;coverers, the <HI>Romans:</HI> Which have continued their E&s;tabli&s;hments in Trade, tho' the Conquerors (the <HI>Romans)</HI> expir'd as a Nation; and witne&s;s the <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Colonies in <HI>Ame|rica,</HI> which continued their trading Circum&s;tances, when the Government of <HI>Great Britain</HI> receiv'd a &s;hock, the Monarchy was overwhelm'd, and in a manner de&s;troy'd in our own Civil Convul|&s;ions.</P>
<P>AND here I might make a u&s;eful Digre&s;&s;ion concerning the durable nature of Commerce; how it e&s;tabli&s;hes Nations, but never de&s;troyes them; how it renders them much more immortal than Conque&s;t and Victory, and gives real, not
<PB N="170" REF="183">
imaginary Triumphs to a People; for example, The Trade in Copper which the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> drove with the City of <HI>Corinth,</HI> of which &s;o much has been &s;aid; and of which the famous <HI>Corinthian</HI> Bra&s;s was made (not of the molten Gold and Cop|per which Fable tells us was found upon Images, among the Statues and Temples of their Gods, and which the Fire melted down in the Conflagra|tion of the City) I &s;ay that Copper continues &s;till a noble Product of the Country of <HI>Africa,</HI> not|with&s;tanding all the Calamities, Di&s;&s;olution of Governments, burning Cities, and even rooting out of People, which has happen'd in <HI>Africa:</HI> The <HI>Carthaginians</HI> went off the Stage fir&s;t, the <HI>Romans</HI> after; the <HI>Vandals, Goths, Saracens,</HI> and <HI>Moors,</HI> have all taken their turn upon the Stage of the <HI>A|frican</HI> Governments; but the Copper Mines are the &s;ame to this Day, and are like to be the &s;ame to the la&s;t Conflagration; but this is a Digre&s;|&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE attempt of the <HI>Romans</HI> upon the <HI>Britains</HI> and the <HI>Belgi,</HI> as I have ob&s;erv'd, were really Di&s;coveries and Improvements; I might indeed &s;ay they were Plantations and Settlements; but tho&s;e are modern Words, not in u&s;e in the <HI>Roman</HI> Days: Colonies indeed they were call'd, and were planted and &s;ettled as &s;uch, and &s;uch <HI>Britain</HI> was in general, and the &s;everal Stations of their Le|gionary Troops were &s;o in particular, and alto|gether were more &s;o, as their Inclinations to re|cover their Liberty were &s;tronger or weaker.</P>
<P>BUT even <HI>Britain,</HI> or the <HI>Belgi,</HI> knew little of Trade till afterwards; for the <HI>Romans</HI> them&s;elves enter'd into no mea&s;ures about Trade; all that occur'd to them in planting &s;uch Colonies was to &s;ecure a Communication with them, to, and from other <HI>Roman Colonies,</HI> or to, and from Nations in &s;ubjection to, or confederacy with the <HI>Romans,</HI>
<PB N="171" REF="184">
that &s;o the Colony might receive &s;upplies of Pro|vi&s;ions, and &s;upport of Troops, as occa&s;ion re|quir'd; and tho' this did even of it&s;elf create Com|merce, and in the con&s;equence of things did in time make Trade, by the indu&s;try and applicati|on of the People, and by their being under the <HI>Roman</HI> Protection; yet the <HI>Romans</HI> them&s;elves never had it in their view, at lea&s;t we &s;ee no room to think they had; nor do the Nations owe their Introductions to Trade to the <HI>Romans,</HI> any otherwi&s;e than as the <HI>Romans</HI> gave them Peace and Protection in the pur&s;uit of the pro&s;pects of Improvement which the nature of things offer'd them, by that Peace and Protection the in|du&s;try of the People receiv'd encouragment.</P>
<P>ADD to this, tho' it be but an Ob&s;ervation by the by, That Religion &s;preading it&s;elf through the World &s;oon after the&s;e Conque&s;ts of the <HI>Ro|mans,</HI> and very much by the help of tho&s;e Con|que&s;ts; I &s;ay Religion &s;preading among the Na|tions introduc'd (with it) principles of Morality, and civiliz'd the People.</P>
<P>FOR take it with you as you go, Religion (I mean the Chri&s;tian Religion) did not at its fir&s;t be|ginning to &s;pread it&s;elf in the World, indulge, or &s;o much as allow the Vices common now to Chri&s;tians; and winked at in Chri&s;tian Nati|ons, &s;uch as Avarice, Craft, Sly, and cunning Circumventing one another, Over-reaching, and fraudulently Cheating in their Dealings, and all the little namele&s;s Cheats and Chicanries of Trade.</P>
<P>THE Chri&s;tian Religion infus'd principles of Hone&s;ty and Plain-Dealing; it recommended a general rectitude of the Mind, a known inte|grity of Principle, a ju&s;t and upright Conduct
<PB N="172" REF="185">
under the awe of an invi&s;ible Being, who in&s;pected the minute&s;t Actions, and wou'd call to account for the mo&s;t &s;ecret conceal'd Wicked|ne&s;s; &s;o that in &s;hort, where the Chri&s;tians be|came Traders, or engaged in Arts, Manufac|tures, and Commerce, there, who ever dealt with them were &s;ure to find upright Dealing, punctual performance of every Agreement; the Hand laid upon the Heart was as &s;acred as an Oath, and what the Mouth &s;poke the Hands were &s;olemnly bound by; in a Word, a general probity and exact hone&s;t procedure govern'd all their Dealings; and this we cannot doubt en|courag'd Trade, as to this Day we &s;ee that foul, unju&s;t, and di&s;hone&s;t u&s;age di&s;courages Trade, and drives away the Merchants even from Ci|ties, and Nations, as well as Per&s;ons.</P>
<P>BUT this Country and the <HI>Belgi,</HI> that is, the <HI>Flemings</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> embraceing the Chri&s;tian Re|ligion, within &s;ixty or &s;eventy Years after their fir&s;t coming under the <HI>Roman</HI> Dominion, it may be &s;aid of them, with truth, that they &s;ooner than other Pagan Nations felt the civilizing in|fluences of Religion; by how much they with a greater willingne&s;s and forwardne&s;s embrac'd the Religion it&s;elf; for 'tis remark'd by the Writers of our Hi&s;tories, in the Story of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> of <HI>Arima|thea,</HI> who was the fir&s;t Apo&s;tle of the <HI>Britains,</HI> that the People mo&s;t gladly, and with the greate&s;t &s;implicity, that is hone&s;ty and integrity, receiv'd the knowledge of CHRIST.</P>
<P>THUS, and I think with great ju&s;tice, I ob&s;erve the &s;ettling Commerce in this part of the World to be the genuine, natural product of the planting Religion, and <HI>Roman</HI> Liberty here together; and 'tis ob&s;ervable to this very Day, that Trade flou|ri&s;hes

<P>BUT the <HI>Romans</HI> made Voyages to the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies.</HI> How? [See the &s;ame Author mention'd before.] Following the Foot-&s;teps of that famous Conqueror <HI>Alexandor Magnus,</HI> they made Voyages to <HI>India</HI> towards the Mouth of <HI>Euphrates:</HI> This di&s;covers evidently the thing. The Mouth of <HI>Eu|phrates</HI> is known to all the World; that River, in conjunction with the <HI>Tigris,</HI> and other great Ri|vers, falls into the <HI>Per&s;ian</HI> Gulph, not into the open Sea: So that the <HI>Roman Fleet</HI> did this, they &s;ail'd or row'd down the <HI>Red Sea,</HI> along by the Coa&s;t of <HI>Mecca</HI> and <HI>Mocha,</HI> and then pa&s;&s;ing the Straights of <HI>Babel-Mandel,</HI> turn'd away to the Ea&s;t, keeping clo&s;e under Shore, by the South-Coa&s;t of <HI>Arabia Felix,</HI> till they came to the <HI>Per|&s;ian</HI> Gulph, which is the Mouth of <HI>Euphrates;</HI> cro&s;|&s;ing which, in that part where it is &s;o narrow, at the I&s;land of <HI>Ormus,</HI> the other Shore immediately begins the <HI>Bactrian</HI> Country, which is the true <HI>India,</HI> now &s;ubject to the Great <HI>Mogul;</HI> and coa&s;t|ing but a very little farther you come to the Ri|ver <HI>Indus,</HI> from which the whole Country takes its Name; and where <HI>Alexander</HI> reduc'd <HI>Porus</HI> the <HI>Bactrian</HI> or <HI>Indian</HI> King.</P>
<P>THIS is the mighty Voyage to <HI>India,</HI> of which &s;o much is &s;aid in honour of the <HI>Roman</HI> Merchants, which con&s;idering the calm Seas and warm Cli|mate, at tho&s;e Sea&s;ons, and in that Latitude, is no more than our Seamen wou'd boldly attempt at any time in a <HI>Grave&s;end-Wherry;</HI> and I mu&s;t &s;ay, and I believe I &s;peak with Rea&s;on; that for a <HI>Grave&s;end-Wherry</HI> to go down from <HI>Grave&s;end</HI> to the <HI>Downs,</HI> and cro&s;s over the Sea there to <HI>Calais,</HI> which they frequently do, is a much more dan|gerous and hazardous thing than all tho&s;e famous Voyages to the <HI>Indies.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="195">
YET it is allow'd that the <HI>Egyptians</HI> had larger and better Ships, and &s;o had the <HI>Tyrians</HI> al&s;o, and the <HI>Carthaginians,</HI> than any the <HI>Romans</HI> had or knew how to have; and it might be in tho&s;e <HI>E|gyptian</HI> Ships that the Voyages to the <HI>Indies</HI> were made: Hence they tell us that <HI>Mark Anthony</HI> when he brought up his Fleet from <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>Egypt,</HI> to fight <HI>Octavius,</HI> when he enter'd the Mouth of the <HI>Adria,</HI> that is, of the Gulph of <HI>Ve|nice,</HI> call'd &s;till the <HI>Adriatic Sea; Octavius,</HI> who fitted out his Fleet at <HI>Ravenna,</HI> tho' he had thirty Ships more than <HI>Authony,</HI> yet was doubtful of en|gageing till he had &s;eventy Ships more from <HI>Pa|tras;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Anthony</HI>'s Ships, built in <HI>Egypt,</HI> were larger and &s;tronger than tho&s;e of the <HI>Romans.</HI> This a full evidence of the Fact.</P>
<P>BESIDES this, 'tis evident they di&s;tingui&s;h'd between Ships of War and Ships of Burthen; as we do (tho' with a ju&s;ter Cau&s;e) to this Day. The Ships of Burthen were only carry'd by the Winds, and with the help of their Sails; whereas the Ships of War were light and nimble, and being carry'd every where by their Oars, were adapted to fight and pur&s;ue: Of the&s;e Ships of Burthen, it &s;eems the <HI>Romans</HI> had none; and were oblig'd to hire them of the <HI>Liburnians,</HI> who were Mer|chants; <HI>that is to &s;ay</HI> they were us'd to fetch Corn from <HI>Egypt</HI> for the &s;upply of the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> and of the Country round it, which was &s;o prodi|giou&s;ly populous, that be&s;ides <HI>Rome</HI> it&s;elf, which had at that time &s;everal Millions of People in it, <HI>Naples, Capua,</HI> and many other Cities of <HI>Italy,</HI> which were exceeding populous; and <HI>Italy</HI> it&s;elf, even with the Corn of <HI>Sicily</HI> adjoin'd, was no way able to &s;upply them; but they fetch'd Corn from <HI>Egypt</HI> in very great quantities, and from all the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa</HI> be&s;ides.</P>

It is evident it mu&s;t be lookt for in the&s;e Northern parts of the World; where the Seas being more dangerous, and the rapid and un|certain Tides, frightful and terrible to Sailors, as Antiquity furni&s;hes us with many evidences to prove, requir'd &s;tronger Ships.</P>

<P>AGAIN the <HI>Goths</HI> and <HI>Vandals,</HI> the <HI>Cimbri,</HI> and the <HI>Heruli,</HI> take them &s;eparately or together; they came from the Northern parts of <HI>Germany,</HI> and the Banks of the <HI>Neckar,</HI> the <HI>Main,</HI> the <HI>Elb,</HI> and the <HI>Havel;</HI> and &s;till all of them came by Land, pa&s;&s;ing into <HI>Italy,</HI> by the Mountains of <HI>Tirol.</HI></P>

<P>THIS brings me back to the Ca&s;e in Hand; As the <HI>Romans</HI> made little or no improvement of Ships, or of Navigation, in rai&s;ing their Empire to that pitch of greatne&s;s, which it was once ar|riv'd at; &s;o the barbarous Nations, which invaded, and at length overthrew the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, had no Ships, and indeed no occa&s;ion of any in the ruin and reduction of it.</P>

that, by the nece&s;&s;ity other Nations found them|&s;elves in of a &s;upply of things &s;o u&s;eful to them, Ships grew nece&s;&s;ary to encourage and pu&s;h on that Commerce: Hence they tell us, that <HI>Bilboa</HI> and <HI>Fuenterabia</HI> were the fir&s;t Building Ports in <HI>Spain;</HI> that here they not only built Ships but employ'd them al&s;o; and that by this means they began to corre&s;pond with the re&s;t of the World, with their own Ships carrying out their own Ma|nufactures, as al&s;o to encourage other Nations to do as they &s;hew'd the example.</P>
<P>WHILE the <HI>Bi&s;cainers</HI> appear'd thus to be the great and fir&s;t Navigators in the Northern part of the Empire; &s;o the <HI>Venetians</HI> were the next, who&s;e ri&s;e is merely owing to the nece&s;&s;ity of Trade; I &s;ay the nece&s;&s;ity of Trade, for they had no other way to live: Fir&s;t, For their Pre&s;erva|tion from the flood of the barbarons Nations, who tore the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire to pieces, they were driven to the nece&s;&s;ity, or at lea&s;t &s;aw it for their purpo&s;e to retire into &s;uch places where they might be&s;t defend them&s;elves; and where the &s;itu|ation made it impracticable for their Enemies to attack them but by Sea: This retreat put them nece&s;&s;arily upon providing a &s;ufficient Strength of &s;uch kind, to pre&s;erve them&s;elves in ca&s;e their Enemies &s;hould get Ships to attack them, or as the nature of their Circum&s;tances requir'd. Thus Nature wrought in both Places, <HI>(viz.)</HI></P>
<P N="1">1. THE Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> a rough, tempe&s;tuous, angry Sea, and famous to this Day for exceed|ing great and hollow Waves, naturally drove the <HI>Bi&s;cainers</HI> to contrive &s;uch Ve&s;&s;els as might bear out again&s;t the roughe&s;t Weather; and they &s;oon by their hardy Adventures obtain'd the credit of bold and expert Seamem: They grew famous too in Trade, for their Iron Manu|facture,

making all &s;orts of Armour, Weapons, and Habiliments of War; and for Swords the <HI>Bi&s;cay Blades</HI> have pre&s;erv'd the Reputation of being the be&s;t temper'd, and of the harde&s;t Metal in the World, even to this Day.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE <HI>Veneti,</HI> as is &s;aid above, became early Navigators in the <HI>Adriatic Gulph,</HI> by the very &s;ame nece&s;&s;ity of their Circum&s;tances; for they having retir'd from the fury of the <HI>Heruli,</HI> and afterwards of the <HI>Lombards,</HI> into the fa&s;tne&s;&s;es and defences of the I&s;lands, near the Mouth of the <HI>Po,</HI> and of the <HI>Adige;</HI> as they form'd them|&s;elves into a &s;trong Body of People, they were &s;oon in a condition to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from Inva&s;ion. But how &s;hould they do to &s;ub&s;i&s;t? For the I&s;lands, to which they retreated, cou'd not &s;upply them with Corn, or any other Pro|vi&s;ions; they were therefore oblig'd, or we may &s;ay, forc'd to go out to Sea, and look abroad for Bread: This naturally put them upon building &s;uch Boats or Ships (for Boats, as we call them now, were call'd Ships in tho&s;e Days) as tho&s;e Occa&s;ions call'd for.</P>
<P>WITH the&s;e they rang'd the Gulph for Corn, whether they &s;ought it in the hone&s;t way of Trade, by Buying and Selling; or that, driven by nece&s;&s;ity, they rov'd about the Seas, and made de&s;cents upon the Country, taking it where they could find it; that we cannot determine at this di&s;tance of Time: It is not improbable, but that the la&s;t was their Ca&s;e; for what Merchandize could they have at that time to exchange? And for Money, it may be &s;uppos'd, that flying, as they did, from the fury of the Barbarians, with their Wives and their Children, they could not carry any great &s;tock with them.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="202">
<HI>HOWEVER it was,</HI> be it by Piracy and Roving, or by plain hone&s;t Buying and Selling, it is not material, but they &s;oon became eminent for Sea Affairs; and in proce&s;s of time venturing out into the <HI>Levant,</HI> and into the <HI>Aegean</HI> Sea, they found the way to <HI>Italy,</HI> and to the antient <HI>Greece,</HI> and among the re&s;t to <HI>Egypt;</HI> from whence bringing back not plenty of Corn only, but the Manufac|tures of the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> of which we have already &s;aid &s;o often, that they had for &s;ome Ages been brought from <HI>India</HI> to <HI>Sues,</HI> either by Sea up the <HI>Arabian</HI> Gulph, or by Caravans through <HI>Arabia</HI> from <HI>Cape Fartack</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;&s;ora,</HI> in the <HI>Per&s;ian Gulph,</HI> to <HI>Aleppo</HI> and <HI>Scanderoon:</HI> By this means the <HI>Venetians</HI> rais'd &s;uch a Reputation for Com|merce and Navigation, and came into it &s;o &s;oon too, that they were for many Ages the Mart for the Silks, Drugs, and Spices of <HI>India, Arabia, Aethiopia,</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ia;</HI> and by it rais'd a general Corre&s;pondence and Commerce, with all the Na|tions of the World; nay, and they held it too, till within the&s;e 300 Years, as I &s;hall &s;hew it in its Place.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e thriving Circum&s;tances we cannot wonder at the Opulence of their Merchants, the Magnificence of their City, and public Edifices, or the Power of their Navies; by which, or by their Money, they made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of a large extended Dominion, as well in the <HI>Levant,</HI> as on the <HI>Terra Firma;</HI> for the extent of their Government was indeed exceeding great; and in a few Ages we find them Ma&s;ters of all the great I&s;lands of the <HI>Levant,</HI> particularly of <HI>Cyprus,</HI> of <HI>Candia,</HI> of <HI>Scio,</HI> and <HI>Negropont;</HI> &s;ome by Con|que&s;t, &s;ome by Purcha&s;e: They were Lords of all the I&s;les of the <HI>Aegean Sea,</HI> of all the antient <HI>Pele|ponne&s;us,</HI> now the <HI>Morea;</HI> they po&s;&s;e&s;t all the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Attica, Achaia,</HI> and <HI>Epirus;</HI> they com|manded

all the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Gulph, except <HI>Ragu&s;a,</HI> and <HI>Dulcigno;</HI> they had the whole Coa&s;t of <HI>Dalmatia, I&s;tria, Croatia,</HI> and <HI>Friuli,</HI> be&s;ides the Countries which they &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;s in <HI>Lombardy,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Verona, Padua,</HI> and many others.</P>
<P>ALL this, or the greate&s;t part of it, was ow|ing to the &s;uperiority of their naval Strength, which for many Ages, was the greate&s;t, as it was cer|tainly the fir&s;t of its kind in the World; nor have they ever been overmatch'd in naval Strength by any of the Powers in that part of the World, till the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;eeing a nece&s;&s;ity of being able to give them a Check, &s;et &s;eriou&s;ly to work to rai&s;e a Fleet &s;uperior to them: This was not till the fifteenth Century, when <HI>Bajazet</HI> the Second fell upon them, and took the <HI>Morea</HI> out of their Hands.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, in the &s;everal Wars they have had with the <HI>Turks,</HI> they have very often fought the <HI>Turki&s;h</HI> Fleets, however powerful, and gene|rally have been attended with Victory, e&s;pecially in the great Battle of <HI>Lepanto, Anno</HI> 1457, of which the World has heard &s;o much; and where the <HI>Turks</HI> lo&s;t &s;eventy Gallies, 30000 Men kill'd, and 20000 Chri&s;tian Slaves &s;et at Liberty.</P>
<P>THIS greatne&s;s of the <HI>Venetian</HI> State, as it was rais'd by Trade, and particularly by that Branch which I have mention'd, namely, the <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Trade, in <HI>Silks</HI> and <HI>Spices;</HI> &s;o when the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> found a nearer way to the <HI>Indies,</HI> by the Cape <HI>de Bon E&s;peranza,</HI> and thereby furni&s;h'd <HI>Europe</HI> with <HI>Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods on cheaper terms; the <HI>Ve|netian</HI> Greatne&s;s felt the mortal Wound, and pre|&s;ently fell into a &s;en&s;ible decay; <HI>Lisbon</HI> encrea&s;|ing in Wealth as <HI>Venice</HI> vi&s;ibly declin'd.</P>
<P N="3">III. HAVING thus given In&s;tances of two &s;orts of People who fir&s;t fell into Trade, and gave encouragement to Navigation, after the de|clining
<PB N="191" REF="204">
of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire. I come now to two more Nations, who, tho' they did the &s;ame, and much about the &s;ame time, yet we cannot &s;ay it had any dependence upon, or was at all influenc'd by the ri&s;e or decay of the <HI>Ro|mans;</HI> but they were rather brought into it by the con&s;equence of things; &s;uch as the &s;ituation of their Country, the Genius and the Circum|&s;tances of their People, and above all the re&s;t, by the nece&s;&s;ities of Trade; and the&s;e are the <HI>Teu|tonick Germans,</HI> a &s;ort of religious People at fir&s;t, and who for Religion conquer'd the <HI>Goths,</HI> which inhabited the Southern Shores of the <HI>Baltick</HI> Seas, where they &s;ettled them&s;elves for a long &s;eries of Ages; always encouraging the People they conquer'd to apply to Trade and Indu&s;try. Thus they grew rich and formidable in the World; and when afterwards they &s;unk as a Government, or Body Politic; 'tis evident, that it was not by a decay of their Commerce, for that continues &s;till, but by the fate of the Times, and the cla&s;hing of the &s;everal neigh|bouring Intere&s;ts which overthrew them; of which I may &s;peak again in the next place.</P>
<P>I HAVE mention'd already, how tho&s;e <HI>Teu|tonicks</HI> were now become the Inhabitants of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia, Courland,</HI> and <HI>Pomerania,</HI> from the City of <HI>Strael|&s;ond</HI> to that of <HI>Dantzick, Koningsberg,</HI> and up quite to <HI>Riga, Revel,</HI> and <HI>Narva,</HI> and were naturally brought to joyn together for Commerce: How their naval Stores grew from being a Supply for their own u&s;e, to be a Merchandize for other parts of the World. I need therefore only add, that this nece&s;&s;arily brought them to building of Ships, and that, &s;uch Ships as might be able to bear the &s;hocks of tho&s;e Seas, and carry the heavy Load|ings of Iron, Copper, and other things of like
<PB N="192" REF="205">
heavy Carriage from one part to another, encou|raging the World by their example to build large Ships like theirs, and to come in with them into a &s;hare of &s;o gainful a Commerce; nor was this all, but the&s;e <HI>Tuetonicks,</HI> I &s;ay, came gradually to be the carryers of tho&s;e Seas, by the con&s;iderable Cor|re&s;pondences which they held on, and the Fi|gure they made; nay they became the mo&s;t pow|erful as well as the riche&s;t People of all the Northern part of the World.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this Wealth; They po&s;&s;e&s;t a large and powerful Territory upon the <HI>Vi&s;tu|la;</HI> al&s;o &s;everal Provinces, as <HI>Livonia, Cour|land,</HI> the Ducal <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> with much of <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania</HI> in their Hands; and &s;o powerful they were at Sea, that to whom&s;oever they lent their Ships, they were &s;ure to conquer their Ene|mies.</P>
<P>I NEED not enter farther into their Hi&s;tory: I am now talking of them as Merchants and Navi|gators; and as &s;uch, they were very con&s;iderable: As to their being <HI>Teutonick Knights,</HI> or of &s;uch an Order; and how they came to obtain the Honours and Dignities they enjoy'd, and how to lo&s;e them again, that's matter of Hi&s;tory, and no part of my pre&s;ent Undertaking; 'tis enough that they ro&s;e by Trade to be the chief Navigators, and the greate&s;t Builders of Ships at that time in the World, and that they came into the la&s;t, by the con&s;equence of the fir&s;t; I mean their mighty Commerce brought them to the building larger and bigger Ships.</P>
<P>NOR did their extraordinary <HI>Commerce</HI> die, tho' they (as a natural effect) went off the Stage, when they ceas'd as an Order of Knights; their Military Order died, but their trading Power ro&s;e higher; for a Confederacy of Towns joyning together afterwards to carry on that Trade, pre|&s;erv'd
<PB N="193" REF="206">
the trading Intere&s;t, and grew greater than ever they were before: The&s;e are tho&s;e we now call <HI>Hans-Towns,</HI> of which the principal Places that retain that Name, and who are &s;till a kind of Common-Wealth of Trade, are the Cities of</P>

<ITEM>Lubeck,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Bremen,</ITEM>
<ITEM>Dantzick, and</ITEM>
<ITEM>Koningsberg.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>ALL the&s;e Towns are to this Day potent in Trade, and likewi&s;e in Shipping; and all except the la&s;t, have always, as occa&s;ion requires, Ships of War in their pay, for the protection of their Trade; and formerly have been able to fit out large Fleets, and to engage with other trading Countries in an open War; tho' now as they are too weak, &s;o they have no occa&s;ion for that part; yet they fit out Men of War often times to convoy their Ships from the Pirates or Privateers of neighbouring Nations when they are at War with one another. But,</P>
<P N="4">IV. THE fourth Article is that which I men|tion'd at fir&s;t, <HI>(viz.)</HI> The <HI>Dutch;</HI> who, be&s;ides what I have &s;aid already, began very early to fit out Ships, and carry on a &s;eparate Bu&s;ine&s;s in the&s;e Northern Seas for the catching and cur|ing of Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>WHAT height of Improvement this Fi&s;hing Trade has been to Navigation as well as to Trade, our pre&s;ent experience abundantly &s;hows; &s;ince the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Dutch,</HI> who have now the greate&s;t &s;hare of the Fi&s;heries of the Northern World, are become by con&s;equence the mo&s;t
<PB N="194" REF="207">
powerful Nations as well in Trade as Naviga|tion.</P>
<P>ALL this while however Navigation was wrapt in its &s;wadling Clouts; the Mathematicks, by which it is now wholly govern'd and regulated, had no concern with, or at all related to it; a very little &s;hare of A&s;tronomy &s;eem'd to inform the Sailors; as which was the <HI>North Star,</HI> which the <HI>Ur&s;a Major;</HI> and the&s;e, and a few Con&s;tellations more, &s;erv'd them &s;o as to guide them to find Land again when they were out of their Knowledge: But all this while they had neither di&s;cover'd Guns to fight with, or Compa&s;s to &s;ail by, but coa&s;ting, and creeping about within &s;ight of Land was generally the utmo&s;t of their Art: How they advanc'd beyond this, and by what degrees they came to the perfection of Marine Knowledge, which is the pre&s;ent State of Na|vigation as a Science; and what infinite Ad|vantages have been made of it in carrying Trade and Di&s;covery up to the pre&s;ent height: The&s;e I &s;hall begin to di&s;cour&s;e of in the next Chapter.</P>

<P>THE periods of Time, in which the things mention'd in the la&s;t Chapter, &s;hou'd be &s;tated, and that we may pre&s;erve Chronology in our Hi&s;tory as we go along, take in few Words thus.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Roman</HI> Empire may be &s;aid to be quite de|funct when <HI>Charlemain</HI> King of <HI>France</HI> po&s;&s;e&s;t <HI>Italy</HI> and the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor re&s;ided at <HI>Con&s;tanti|nople,</HI> having no power to prevent the ruin of it; and this was about the Year 800.</P>
<P>THE State of <HI>Venice</HI> was founded in the Year 453, but they did not arrive to their full Inde|pendence; and to act in Trade, and &s;et up Li|berty, till the Year 1120, or thereabouts.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Teutonick Knights</HI> began their Conque&s;ts and Progre&s;s <HI>Anno</HI> 1222, or there abouts. Their Bu&s;ine&s;s was fir&s;t reducing the Pagans <HI>(Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> Inhabitants) by force to their Obedience, and planting the knowledge of the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion among them: Thus far their planting in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> was really <HI>a New Di&s;covery</HI> to the World,
<PB N="196" REF="209">
at that Time: As for the <HI>Poles,</HI> the Country of the <HI>Sarmatae,</HI> had receiv'd the Go&s;pel, and all <HI>Poland</HI> and <HI>Lithuania,</HI> as it was then pre&s;crib'd and limited, were become Chri&s;tians &s;ome Years before the&s;e Provinces of <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia, Courlan|dia, Samogitia,</HI> and <HI>Livonia,</HI> heard any thing of it, or at lea&s;t before they could be brought to entertain any &s;en&s;e of it them&s;elves; all at|tempts to plant Religion among them, of which kind many it &s;eems had been made, remain'd long ineffectual: A certain brutal Ob&s;tinacy particular to the People of tho&s;e remote Coun|tries prevail'd &s;o far, as to make them reject all the offers that had been made for their Good, and embrace their Idols and Pagani&s;m with &s;uch an unmoveable Attachment, that nothing could at la&s;t remove them but Force and the Sword.</P>
<P>NAY, if we may give Credit to Hi&s;torians, and tho&s;e Men of Credit too, <HI>Pagani&s;m</HI> is not to this Day entirely rooted out of &s;ome of the&s;e very Provinces, but that the People in the mountainous part of <HI>Samogitia,</HI> and the <HI>Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> the De&s;art of <HI>Wald&s;hont,</HI> and even &s;ome part of <HI>Courland,</HI> wor&s;hip the antient Idols and wooden Images of the Pagans, and keep them in their Hou&s;es; nor can they be brought to know any thing of the true God, or entertain any notion of it, or of the Chri&s;tian Religion, or of Sabbath-Day, or Working-Day, nor will they hear of it, but with je&s;t and ri|dicule.</P>
<P>BUT I am not writing of improvements in Re|ligion, or giving a Hi&s;tory of new Di&s;coveries in matters of Wor&s;hip, or the knowledge of God, but of improvement in Commerce and Manufac|tures; di&s;coveries in Art, Science, Navigation,
<PB N="197" REF="210">
and Plantation; and therefore I return to my Sub|ject from whence this is but a Digre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Teutonick Knights</HI> were a &s;et of Men form'd into a religious Order for the Conver&s;ion of the Barbarians, and &s;preading the Chri&s;tian Religion in the World, in tho&s;e good old Days, when Zeal ran before, and Devotion, tho' with <HI>too much</HI> Ignorance, rod behind. And when the Nations of <HI>Europe</HI> took up the Cro&s;s, as it was then call'd, that is, li&s;ted them&s;elves at the beat of the Churches Drums to go and drive out the Heathen from God's Heritage, which it is evident he had for&s;aken, and given them leave to over|run, and to enclo&s;e God's Common, which he him|&s;elf had laid open, as is apparent from the Cir|cum&s;tances.</P>
<P>THAT they ran before they were &s;ent; that they neither had his help in the Undertaking, or his Ble&s;&s;ing in the Succe&s;s is evident from the confus'd manner of carrying it on as well as their being vi&s;ibly abandon'd in the conclu&s;ion of it; &s;o after &s;ome Ages &s;pent in the Attempts, &s;ome Millions of Lives lo&s;t, and an infinite ma&s;s of Trea&s;ure, the <HI>Saracens,</HI> to whom God &s;eem'd to give a more &s;pecial Mi&s;&s;ion, prevail'd over them all; &s;o their Eyes began to be open'd, and they thought fit to abandon an Enterpri&s;e which had neither human Prudence, or the ordinary &s;ucce&s;s to encourage them in it.</P>
<P>UPON this melancholy giving up that Cau&s;e, what was to be done with the &s;everal &s;worn Socie|ties of Devotees, who calling them&s;elves Knights and Servants of Chri&s;t, had vowed their Lives and Prowe&s;s (as they call'd it) to fight for Religion, and in the Language of tho&s;e devout Days, to <HI>help the Lord again&s;t the Mighty.</HI> The Knights <HI>Templars</HI> and Knights <HI>Ho&s;pitallers;</HI> for tho&s;e two &s;orts were the chief, &s;ettled, &s;ome here, &s;ome there, as the Princes
<PB N="198" REF="211">
and Powers of <HI>Europe</HI> wou'd entertain them; till in time they became &s;o in&s;olent, &s;o wicked, and &s;o dangerous, that the Princes and Powers, who had been their Patrons, thought them un&s;ufferable, and expel'd and rooted them out, in all Nations; the only remains of them in the World at this Day are the Knights of <HI>Maltha,</HI> of whom I have little or no occa&s;ion to &s;peak in this Work.</P>
<P>BUT another Branch of them, wandering from <HI>Syria,</HI> and almo&s;t de&s;troy'd by the <HI>Turks</HI> under the victorious <HI>Saladine,</HI> were it &s;eems call'd Knights of <HI>our Lady</HI> of <HI>Mount-Sion.</HI> As the&s;e were in&s;tituted by <HI>Conrade</HI> the &s;econd Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> &s;o they were at their fir&s;t In&s;titution re&s;train'd to be all of that <HI>Nation,</HI> and were therefore call'd <HI>Teutones,</HI> that is to &s;ay <HI>Germans;</HI> and from this being call'd Knights of the <HI>Teutones,</HI> they &s;oon came to be call'd <HI>Teutonick Knights.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER they were thus, as I &s;aid, routed and driven out of the <HI>Holy Land, Henry</HI> Duke of <HI>Ma&s;|&s;ovia</HI> in <HI>Poland</HI> invited them into his Country, and repre&s;enting to them the condition of the Northern parts of his Kingdom; how all that Country, now call'd <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Ducal Pru&s;&s;ia, Courland, Livonia,</HI> &amp;c. was &s;till in the Hands of the Pagans; and they offering them&s;elves to the Work according to the Vows of their Order to propagate the Chri&s;tian Faith, and to pull down Pagani&s;m, he gave them a grant of all the Lands they could conquer in tho&s;e Countries; and thus they began the War, in which, having fought many bloody Battles with the Pagans, for they did not tamely give up their Country, any more than their Idolatry, they at la&s;t reduc'd all <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia, Courland,</HI> and <HI>Livonia,</HI> planting them&s;elves (as well as the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion) in their room.</P>
<P><PB N="199" REF="212">
HAVING thus gotten po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Coun|try, they immediately began to build Cities, for|tify Sea-ports, and &s;trengthen their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, finding the Country fertile and capable of Im|provement. The Natives cleaving to Idola|try, were either extirpated by the War, or driven farther into the wild, wa&s;te Countries towards <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> where Idolatry continued &s;ome Ages, and in the Northern parts of it, as among the <HI>Samaoides</HI> and <HI>Petzoran</HI> it &s;till remains: The <HI>Knights</HI> invited <HI>Germans</HI> of their own Nation to come and &s;ettle under them; and thus the Country became Popu|lous; Religion flouri&s;h'd, with Religion came in Li|berty of cour&s;e, and with Liberty Commerce; thus in a few Ages this Country became the mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing place of Trade in the World; al&s;o the People were call'd <HI>Teutones,</HI> and their Govern|ment <HI>Teutonick.</HI></P>

<P>As the Government of the <HI>Teutonick Knights</HI> was thus founded on Religion and Liberty, which two Heads as I have ob&s;erv'd, were the great en|couragers of Indu&s;try and Application to Bu&s;ine&s;s; &s;o the natural product of the Country led them as it were by the Hand into the &s;everal Species of Trade which they were to deal in; &s;uch as,</P>

<HI>Courland, Livonia,</HI> &amp;c. and perhaps (at that time) in no other part of the known World.</P>
<P N="2">II. HEMP and Flax, things infinitely u&s;eful for <HI>Cordage</HI> and <HI>Canvas,</HI> the two mo&s;t nece&s;&s;a|ry things requir'd for the furni&s;hing of Ships, and for the helping on Commerce were then very young in the World.</P>
<P N="3">III. PITCH, Tar, Rozin, all of them branches of tho&s;e great and nece&s;&s;ary things u&s;ed in Shipping, or of the one general Article call'd Naval Stores, and without which the Marine Magazines could not be fully furni&s;h'd.</P>
<P N="4">IV. WHETHER they had Iron in this Country then, or not, Hi&s;tory is &s;ilent, but as we have good witne&s;s of its being long before that time found in <HI>Sweden,</HI> we need not doubt they found means to obtain it, in exchange for other Goods.</P>
<P>THUS began this great improvement of Trade in the <HI>Baltic:</HI> How this great Di&s;covery, (as great and as u&s;efull in its place as that of <HI>America,</HI> has been to <HI>Europe</HI> in our Days) is &s;ince encreas'd by &s;everal &s;teps of improve|ment in Trade, to the magnitude which we find it in at this time, will be matter of farther Hi&s;tory in its Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>HOW al&s;o after the ruin of this <HI>Teutonick</HI> Government, and after the Order it&s;elf cea&s;ed, a trading Confederacy was fixed in that part of the World among the principal Cities, Sea-ports, and trading Towns of the <HI>Baltic,</HI> for the protection of their Commerce, and how other Cities, and in other parts of the World, came in|to that Confederacy of Trade, and were after|wards
<PB N="201" REF="214">
call'd the HANS, or the Union of the <HI>Hans-Towns,</HI> of which I have more to &s;ay hereafter; I &s;ay all this will come to be &s;poken of in cour&s;e. I have only to add here, that this call of the <HI>Teu|tonick</HI> Knights into <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> was in the thirteenth <HI>Century,</HI> that is to &s;ay about the Year 1232, and not before: So long was it before the Chri&s;tian Religion reach'd the Shores of the <HI>Baltic</HI> Sea.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ettlement of the <HI>Teutonicks</HI> in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia</HI> has been the foundation of all the Commerce of the <HI>Baltic,</HI> which without any blu&s;ter, is at this time one of the mo&s;t flouri&s;hing Articles of Trade in <HI>Europe;</HI> and e&s;pecially attended with this particu|lar and very valuable Circum&s;tance, that 'tis car|ryed on to the greate&s;t extent with the lea&s;t &s;hare of Money in Specie, of any Trade at this time known in the World.</P>
<P>ALL the Goods we &s;end thither are &s;uch, as is mo&s;t for our Intere&s;t to export: All the Goopds we fetch from thence are &s;uch, as it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for us to import.</P>
<P>WHEN I &s;peak in the fir&s;t Per&s;on Plural or Na|tionally, under the terms we, and us; I mean not, <HI>England</HI> or <HI>Britain</HI> only, but us the trading Nati|ons of <HI>Europe,</HI> taken complexly. <HI>Spain</HI> is the only Nation that may be &s;aid to &s;end Money in Specie into the <HI>Baltic;</HI> but then <HI>Spain,</HI> till very lately, &s;ent no Ships thither, but contented them&s;elves with buying all their Naval Stores at &s;econd Hand from the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>BUT &s;etting <HI>Spain</HI> a&s;ide; <HI>England,</HI> or <HI>Britain,</HI> &s;ends their Ships for the <HI>Baltic</HI> loaden with <HI>Fi&s;h, Salt, Lead, Tin, Pewter, Sugars, Tobacco, Ea&s;t India</HI> Goods, and <HI>Woollen</HI> and <HI>Silk Manufactures;</HI> be|ing all of them, <HI>except the Ea&s;t India Goods,</HI> the growth of our own Land, or Seas, the Manufac|tures
<PB N="202" REF="215">
of our own People, or of our own Colonies, (which is all one); and all of which it is highly our own Intere&s;t to export, and which is, in one re|&s;pect, clear gain to our Country.</P>
<P>ON the other Hand, what we fetch from thence is chiefly <HI>Iron, Copper, Pitch, Tar, Hemp, Flax, Canvas, Linen Yarn, Pot A&s;hes, Ru&s;&s;ia Leather, Harts-horn, Amber, Sturgeon, Oaken Plank, Fir, Timber, Deals,</HI> &amp;c. in a word, all &s;orts of Naval Stores, without which our Navigation, and con|&s;equently our Commerce, wou'd be dear, and be but ill carry'd on, if it could be really &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in the pre&s;ent extent of it.</P>
<P>THUS much for the Trade of the <HI>Baltic.</HI> The Trade of the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and of the <HI>French,</HI> to the <HI>Baltic,</HI> differs not at all from ours, but thus,</P>
<P>THE <HI>Dutch</HI> fetch a va&s;t quantity of Corn from thence, and carry a va&s;t quantity of Her|rings thither, more than we do; al&s;o Spices, Train Oil, and Whale Fin.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French</HI> fetch from thence ju&s;t what we do, only they carry thither Wine and Brandy, Silks, Toys, Perfumes, Paper, and &s;uch things, in&s;tead of the Woollen Manufactures.</P>
<P>BUT take the Trade of all the three Nations. Here is neither Silver or Gold carry'd one way or other, but they trade infinitely to Advantage both ways without it; making good the deficiency or the balance of Trade upon one Nation, by Drafts upon another, and governing the whole by the Rates of the Exchange; which is generally negotiated upon <HI>Hamburg.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING thus mention'd the State of <HI>Venice,</HI> and the trading part of the <HI>Teutones,</HI> or <HI>Germans,</HI> it follows to take notice, that about the &s;ame time the erecting the Woollen Manufacture in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> and the Herring Fi&s;hing in the North came upon the Stage; and they were in
<PB N="203" REF="216">
their kind two great Di&s;coveries as well as Im|provements in the World: I &s;hall &s;peak of their beginnings with that brevity, which not our pre|&s;ent Undertaking only, but the remote Circum|&s;tances of the things them&s;elves (and which Hi&s;|tory gives not much light into) obliges me to.</P>
<P>THE coming of the Herrings annually, and in their exact Sea&s;on into the&s;e Northern Seas, and not in like quantities into any other part of <HI>Europe,</HI> as it is &s;urprizing and unaccountable, &s;o it mu&s;t be taken notice of here, not &s;o much on its own particular account, as to introduce the needful Improvements in Commerce, which have been the Con&s;equence.</P>
<P>THE coming of the Herrings may be a di&s;co|very in Nature, but it is not a di&s;covery of a new Country, or Colony, and con&s;equently does not come in within the Head of Di&s;coveries, which I am &s;peaking of; but the di&s;covery of them as a foundation of Commerce merits to be &s;poken of here, and on all &s;uitable Occa&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t fi&s;hing for Herrings in <HI>Europe</HI> was certainly in <HI>Scotland;</HI> Nature &s;pread the Field of Trea&s;ure before them, which, however ill they have improv'd it, has been like the <HI>Indies,</HI> at their Door.</P>
<P>ALL the <HI>Scots</HI> Hi&s;tories mention their Fi&s;hery as well as that of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> almo&s;t as far back as they mention any thing of <HI>Britain</HI> as a Nation; but they do not &s;peak of it as a Trade or Mer|chandize. The fir&s;t I meet with of this is, that the <HI>Dutch</HI> u&s;ed to &s;end Ve&s;&s;els to the Coa&s;t of <HI>Scotland</HI> to buy &s;alred Fi&s;h [Herrings] of the <HI>Scots</HI> Fi&s;hermen, which they carry'd home to their own Country for the Sub&s;i&s;tance of their own People; and this I think may be trac'd back to the Year 836, or thereabouts; the <HI>Saxons</HI> then
<PB N="204" REF="217">
inhabiting <HI>Britain,</HI> King <HI>Alfred</HI> then governing the Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI> and by this Trade the <HI>Scots</HI> were greatly enrich'd, the <HI>Dutch</HI> paying ready Money for their Fi&s;h.</P>
<P>BUT time and want of foreca&s;t brought the <HI>Scots</HI> to differ with their good Friends and Cu&s;|tomers the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and putting &s;ome hard&s;hips upon the <HI>Dutch</HI> in buying, prompted the latter to reject the <HI>Scots</HI> Fi&s;h wholly, and bring Nets and Ve&s;&s;els of their own, and catch as well as cure the Fi&s;h upon the High-Seas them&s;elves, to the utter ruin of the <HI>Scots</HI> Fi&s;hermen, and in &s;hort to the great impoveri&s;hing that whole Kingdom, and as much on the other Hand to the enrich|ing of the <HI>Dutch.</HI></P>
<P>UPON this new &s;tep, the <HI>Dutch</HI> finding the &s;weet of the Trade, and finding the quantity greater than they could con&s;ume at home, they began to look abroad, and carry the Herrings cur'd and pickled to other Countries, to &s;ee if they could di&s;po&s;e of them to advantage. And thus this great and flouri&s;hing Trade began.</P>
<P>IF in the proce&s;s of this Work we &s;hall trace all the other con&s;iderable branches of the Trade of <HI>Europe</HI> to their infancy and be|ginning, and bring them down from thence to their pre&s;ent condition, and their probable views of encrea&s;e, we flatter our&s;elves it will not be an unprofitable, much le&s;s an unplea&s;ant Di&s;covery, and be what is perfectly agreeable to our Title, and to the meaning of this Under|taking. This <HI>beginning</HI> of the Herring Fi&s;hery as a Commerce, was about the Year 1320, not long after the encrea&s;e of the <HI>Tentonick</HI> Settle|ments in the <HI>Baltick.</HI></P>
<P>AND much about the &s;ame time was the fir&s;t con&s;iderable greatne&s;s of the Woollen Manufac|ture al&s;o begun among the <HI>Flemings;</HI> &s;o that
<PB N="205" REF="218">
the World &s;eem'd all to launch out into Trade to|gether. How they gradually went on we &s;hall &s;ee in its place.</P>
<P>WHILE thus Navigation and foreign Nego|tiation began in the Bay of <HI>Bi&s;cay,</HI> and the Gulph of <HI>Venice,</HI> Exportation of Naval Stores in the <HI>Baltick,</HI> Fi&s;hing among the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and ma|nufacturing of Wooll among the <HI>Flemings,</HI> we &s;hould enquire how &s;tood things with <HI>England, Portugal, France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> which are now &s;o con&s;iderable in Trade.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Roman</HI> Empire died, as I have &s;aid, about the latter end of the eighth Century, when the <HI>French</HI> or <HI>Gallick</HI> Kings took upon them the title of Kings of <HI>Lombardy.</HI></P>
<P>AS the &s;everal Princes u&s;urp'd the royalty of the Dominions which they po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, the <HI>Roman</HI> Power not being able to prevent them, <HI>England</HI> among the re&s;t fell to the lot of the <HI>Saxons;</HI> who fir&s;t driving the <HI>Britains</HI> out divided this Country into a Heptarchy of Kingdoms; of which in proce&s;s of time the greater devour'd all the re&s;t, as is u&s;ual in like Ca&s;es: So began the Empire of <HI>Charlemaign,</HI> who was King of <HI>France,</HI> King of <HI>Italy,</HI> and Emperor of <HI>Germany,</HI> all at once: But that is by the way.</P>
<P>AS the <HI>Saxons</HI> held the Monarchy of <HI>England</HI> with a &s;hort interruption from the <HI>Danes,</HI> till the coming of the <HI>Normans,</HI> we have good Rea&s;on in the Hi&s;tories of tho&s;e Times to ob&s;erve, that <HI>England</HI> was all that while very little acquainted with Commerce; the Kings were taken up with continual Wars with one another, the common People being, as our antient Deeds and Charters of Lands expre&s;s it, mere Slaves and Servants to the Lords. Va&s;&s;alage and Villainage took up the whole ma&s;s of the People, and their whole em|ploy &s;eem'd to be to wait upon the Nobility, and
<PB N="206" REF="219">
be at their beck, as we call it, to laquy it after them to the War, which took up the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> or to till and plow the Land, and do the drudgery of the Husbandmen, and this took up the <HI>la&s;t;</HI> as for Trade little of it was known, and of Manufacture nothing at all.</P>
<P>YET in all this time, as far as Hi&s;tory may be depended upon for any thing, we find the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation were mighty Gay; the Nobility gave Badges and Liveries to their Tenants and Va&s;&s;als; and the Clothes they wore were very fine: Whence then did they come? 'Tis evident they came from the <HI>Flemings,</HI> who made all &s;orts of Cloth and Stuffs; that is to &s;ay all &s;orts that were then known, and with them they &s;upply'd all the Countries round them; to wit, <HI>France, Germany, Spain,</HI> and <HI>England;</HI> &s;o great was the Manufacture in tho&s;e Days; and this we are a&s;|&s;ur'd was &s;o even long before that time we &s;peak of, and even in the time when <HI>Adrian</HI> the <HI>Roman</HI> Emperor came into the&s;e parts of the World; for the Emperor <HI>Adrian</HI> vi&s;ited in Per&s;on every part of the whole <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, as big as it then was; and it was then in the meridian of its Great|ne&s;s.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Flemings</HI> then began to manufac|ture about the Year 260; tho' I have not po&s;itive proof, yet I &s;ee many Rea&s;ons to believe it, too long to enter upon here; and that they had their Wooll from <HI>England</HI> from the very beginning, I make no que&s;tion; al&s;o it is very probable the Wooll of <HI>England</HI> was at that time an exceeding great Article; that is to &s;ay the quantity was ve|ry great for many Rea&s;ons, as I &s;hall &s;peak of hereafter: I &s;ay the <HI>Flemings</HI> in all probability began thus early to be Manufacturers; but it was &s;ome time before that Manufacture en|creas'd
<PB N="207" REF="220">
to the degree which afterwards we find it arriv'd to.</P>
<P>BUT this leads me back to the Subject in Hand: Nece&s;&s;ity introduc'd Manufacture; for the People had a nece&s;&s;ity of Cloathing, and cloathing with Skins of Bea&s;ts began now to be left off; the <HI>Roman</HI> having &s;hew'd the World a more polite way of dre&s;s; &s;o Manufacture was the Daughter of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, and Trade was the Child of Manufacture, as Navigation was the Offspring of Trade: The Genealogy is &s;hort and plain.</P>
<P>NECESSITY begat Manufacture, Manufac|ture begat Trade, and Trade begat Navigation. Let us then take the <HI>Flemings</HI> as they really were, the fir&s;t Merchants in this part of the World, which Merchandizing began by their &s;ending their Manufactures abroad to purcha&s;e with them nece&s;|&s;ary things for the carrying the&s;e very Manufac|tures. On this Merchandize nece&s;&s;arily imployed Ships and Sailors to fetch Wooll from <HI>England,</HI> Oil from <HI>France;</HI> al&s;o Fullers Earth, and many other Materials from <HI>England;</HI> and thus Trade grew up here.</P>
<P>IT may be wonder'd at, and indeed it is the admiration of the Age, and has been of the World, that <HI>England,</HI> who alone was the only Fountain, from whence the Wooll, which was, as I may call it, the Blood of the Manufacture, flowed, &s;hou'd for &s;o many Ages &s;it &s;till, &s;ee their Neighbours grow rich, and powerful, and opulent, by their Indu&s;try and Application, and &s;hould &s;upinely dream over it, &s;ell the Wooll away to <HI>Flanders,</HI> to <HI>Antwerp,</HI> and to <HI>Sluice,</HI> which were in their turn the Staples for our Wooll, and &s;ee their own Women and Children idle and &s;tarving, the Poor out of Bu&s;ine&s;s, without Employment, flock|ing over to tho&s;e Countries, and peopling their Towns, becoming Foreiguers like them&s;elves, and
<PB N="208" REF="221">
never &s;o much as try whether they could not ma|nufacture their own Wooll, and not &s;end abroad for Cloaths to wear, after tho&s;e People had &s;ent home to us for the Wooll to make them.</P>
<P>NOR is the ignorance and &s;otti&s;hne&s;s of this &s;o wonderful, as that it &s;hould continue for &s;o many Ages, and till within &s;o little a while ago as the Reign of <HI>Henry</HI> VII. <HI>(viz.)</HI> in the fifteenth Century: That wi&s;e Prince was the fir&s;t that look'd into the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this Ca&s;e: He &s;aw the &s;hameful Indolence of the Nation; and how his Neighbours grew rich by that very Manufac|ture, the want of which made his Subjects poor. He had liv'd abroad in Exile, and been in the Court of the Earl of <HI>Flanders:</HI> There he had &s;een the Opulence of the Court, the Indu&s;try of the People, and the Wealth of the Cities and Towns rais'd by that Indu&s;try; and in the mean time the &s;olid Principles of the whole Trade to be found only in <HI>England,</HI> and no where el&s;e in the whole World; and this wrought in the Mind of that a|varitious tho' politic Prince, and he pre&s;ently &s;aw when he came to the Crown, that it was his bu&s;i|ne&s;s no more to let this &s;ource of Wealth flow in|to the Coffers of his Neighbours, but to &s;et his own People to Work to manufacture the Wooll at home; by which, (as he &s;aid to his Mother the Counte&s;s of <HI>Richmond)</HI> he &s;hou'd not only keep the Money at home, but bring Money from all parts of the World to his own Country to buy the Manufacture here, as they did before in <HI>Flanders;</HI> and the event &s;oon an&s;wer'd his End, and &s;hewed the prudence of the De&s;ign, as we &s;hall &s;ee in its place.</P>
<P>BUT to go back to this Affair of the prodigi|ous extent of the Woollen Manufacture in <HI>Flan|ders;</HI> for People who have not read the Hi&s;tories of their own Country, will hardly believe it po&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="209" REF="222">
that <HI>England</HI> could ever be &s;o blind, or be &s;o ridden upon by their <HI>Dutch</HI> Neighbours, as to &s;end their Wooll over to be manufactured abroad, or that if it was &s;o, that they &s;hould continue in &s;uch a &s;tate of Indolence &s;o long.</P>
<P>I SAY, le&s;t it &s;hould be doubted, I &s;hall only &s;ingle out a <HI>Flaming</HI> In&s;tance of it, in the time of one of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t glorious of our Kings, namely, <HI>Edward</HI> III. who&s;e Reign is famous for its Splendor, and for the Honour of the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Nation, who erected the Order of the Garter; who&s;e Court was all Magnificence, Fea&s;ting, and Tournament for the Knights, Balls and Ma&s;que|rades for the Ladies; at one of which, a famous <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Lady, in her dancing, dropt her Garter, and which the King &s;aw and took up; from which ridiculous piece of Wantonne&s;s the Right Noble Order of the Garter took its Original or Device; yet even in this Kings Reign the Wooll of <HI>England</HI> was &s;old to the <HI>Flemings,</HI> to be manufactured abroad; for proof of which, to give one In&s;tance for all the re&s;t, and that I may not tire the Rea|der with &s;o &s;hameful and unplea&s;ant a Story, I refer him to Mr. <HI>Rymer</HI>'s <HI>Foedera,</HI> or <HI>Acta Publica,</HI> where he will find, that in the Year 1338 the Lai|ty granted to the King the one half of their Woolls throughout the whole Realm, for one Year, namely, for the next Summers Sheering: So that the King &s;ent out his Collectors, who took the half of every Man's Wooll for the King; and of the Clergy the King took all their Wooll; &s;o that of the Abbey of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> only the King took eighteen Sacks of Wooll, each Sack worth forty Pounds, that is to &s;ay in <HI>Flanders,</HI> where it &s;eems it &s;old to very good profit; for in <HI>England</HI> the Wooll, then &s;old for, or was rated at, but two Shillings per Stone, each Stone weigh|ing</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="223">
fourteen Pounds Weight: This was in the &s;ame Year 1338.</P>
<P>NOW the &s;ame account &s;ays, that the King &s;ent the Earls of <HI>Northampton</HI> and <HI>Suffolk</HI> into <HI>Flanders,</HI> with ten thou&s;and Sacks of Wooll, who &s;old the &s;ame in <HI>Brabant</HI> for four hundred thou&s;|and Pounds Sterling, which is no le&s;s than forty Pounds per Pack, and which was an immen&s;e Sum in tho&s;e Days.</P>
<P>FARTHER, we find in the next Reign to this, that the Parliament granted to the King a Tax of fifty Shillings upon every Sack of Wooll exported by our own People, and three Pounds per Sack for Wooll exported by Strangers.</P>
<P>THESE things are to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e two ways; <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> They &s;hew eminently to what a great height of improvement the Manufacture was alrea|dy brought in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and <HI>Brabant,</HI> and <HI>Hainault,</HI> that is to &s;ay all over the <HI>Low-Countries,</HI> in the thirteenth and fourteenth Century; and what a prodigious Con&s;umption of Wooll was made in tho&s;e Countries, that they could buy ten thou&s;|and Sacks of Wooll of the King at one Sea&s;on, and pay &s;uch a prodigious price for it, at that time too.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Secondly,</HI> It is a record again&s;t us, to &s;how the &s;tupidity of this Nation, who to &s;o late a time as this, and above 100 Years after it, continued to let their Wooll be carry'd out of the Land, and be manufactured abroad, to the infinite profit and encouragement of the <HI>Flemings;</HI> when our own People here &s;at begging and &s;tarving for want of Work; and for 100 Years together follow'd the Prie&s;ts and Prie&s;t-ridden Princes, <HI>ala Santa Terra,</HI> to find Graves in the <HI>Arabian</HI> De&s;arts among the <HI>Turks,</HI> and all for want of Bu&s;ine&s;s at home.</P>
<P>KING <HI>Henry</HI> VII. a Prince of &s;uperior Genius for matters of Improvement to all that went be|fore
<PB N="211" REF="224">
him, was the fir&s;t that &s;aw the folly of all this, and that open'd the Nations Eyes to &s;ee into it al&s;o: And this he did fir&s;t, by inviting over &s;everal <HI>Flemings,</HI> who were Ma&s;ter Manufacturers, as we now call them, and who were thorowly skill'd in the managing, ordering, and directing the Wooll, to prepare it for working; The&s;e began with teaching our Poor in the fir&s;t place to <HI>Spin;</HI> upon which it &s;oon appear'd that we could both make the Yarn as good, and much cheaper than the <HI>Flemings;</HI> &s;o that in a little time, in&s;tead of Wooll, the <HI>Flemings</HI> came over hither, and bought Yarn ready Spun, ju&s;t as we buy Yarn now from <HI>Ireland;</HI> for the Ca&s;e in <HI>Flanders</HI> was then, ju&s;t as the Ca&s;e of <HI>England</HI> is now, the poor by a flu&s;h of Trade and con&s;tant Work were grown rich and &s;aucy; they wou'd work indeed when they pleas'd, but they wou'd have their own price, and work how, and when, and how much they pleas'd, ju&s;t as ours do at this Day; For,</P>
<Q><P><HI>The Poor of every Nation are the &s;ame.</HI></P></Q>
<P>WHEREAS our Poor, that is to &s;ay the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Poor, were really indigent, very poor; poor and needy, glad to get any thing, and will|ing to do a great deal of Work for a little Money; &s;o that when they began to fall into the Spinning, they not only did it well and handily, &s;o as very &s;oon to out-do their Teachers, but they wrought &s;o cheap, and at &s;o very low a price, that for &s;ome Years afterwards the quantity of Wooll that went abroad, was much dimini&s;h'd, and the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI> Yarn grew a valuable Merchandize in <HI>Flanders,</HI> and much more e&s;teem'd than their own; at the &s;ame time the Dealers in it found the benefit by buying it &s;o cheap in <HI>England;</HI> &s;o that the Yarn
<PB N="212" REF="225">
Buyers and Wooll Combers in <HI>England</HI> grew rich, as it were on a &s;uddain.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, if we may believe Tradition and Report, the <HI>Flemings</HI> had Wit little enough (for Nations &s;ometimes are blind as well as Men) to take Umbrage at the great Importation of Yarn from <HI>England,</HI> and to make their advantage, by laying a Tax upon it, or at lea&s;t to threaten the Prohibiting of it.</P>
<P>BUT as one Improvement generally brings on another, the King People began to be acquainted with the Wooll Trade, and that the Manufacture began here and there to take footing in <HI>England,</HI> and being fully &s;atisfied, that if the <HI>Flemings</HI> had not Wooll from <HI>England</HI> they could have it no where el&s;e; he re&s;olv'd to bring them to be glad to buy their Yarn here, and give a good price for it too; and at once, &s;trook that fa|tal blow that ruin'd the <HI>Flemings</HI> and all their Commerce, as to the Wooll it&s;elf; for he got an Act pa&s;s'd in his Parliament to prohibit carrying any more Wooll out of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>THIS was a mortal blow to the <HI>Flemings,</HI> and made &s;uch a combu&s;tion among them, that had they been able they wou'd have declar'd War again&s;t King <HI>Henry,</HI> and have come over and fetch'd the Wooll away by force; but he was above that, he neither fear'd them, or the whole World, as to Inva&s;ion; &s;o they were oblig'd to be contented, and to rumage the whole World for Wooll to carry on their Bu&s;ine&s;s. Now tho' they had &s;ome Wooll out of <HI>Normandy,</HI> &s;ome from <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;ome from <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;ome from <HI>Ireland;</HI> yet none, except the la&s;t, came up to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> for good|ne&s;s; &s;o that they were glad to take the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Yarn, which they had forbidden before, and it was but a little while that they had the liberty of the Yarn too, tho' I do not find it prohibited in
<PB N="213" REF="226">
King <HI>Henry</HI>'s time neither; for tho' our People be|gan to make &s;everal &s;orts of Woollen Manufac|tures in that Prince's Time, yet they were not immediately in a condition to work up all the Wooll of the growth of the whole Nation, and &s;o &s;upply them&s;elves and other Countries too, as has been the Ca&s;e &s;ince: But it was a great Im|provement, and a great &s;troke to the &s;upport of the People, that they were able to &s;pin it into Yarn; they did perhaps manufacture a great deal of it, and e&s;pecially &s;o much as was &s;ufficient for the &s;upply of their own Country, and exported abroad &s;uch Yarn only as they could not work up.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Counties in <HI>England,</HI> who fell into the Clothing, we find to be the We&s;t-Riding of <HI>York&s;hire,</HI> and the Ea&s;tern parts of <HI>Lanca&s;hire;</HI> that is to &s;ay the great Towns of <HI>Leeds, Wakefield,</HI> and <HI>Hallifax,</HI> in the fir&s;t; and <HI>Rochdale</HI> and <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> in the la&s;t; in all the la&s;t of which the Manufac|ture &s;till remains.</P>
<P>THEN the We&s;tern Countries of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Wilts,</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> where al&s;o it &s;till remains, and particularly <HI>Berk&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>BUT the Woollen Manufacture never came up to its full Maturity in <HI>England</HI> till the time of Queen <HI>Elizabeth;</HI> when by the Per&s;ecution of the Duke of <HI>Alva</HI> in the <HI>Netherlands,</HI> the <HI>Flemings</HI> flying from the cruelty of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> &s;ettled here in <HI>England;</HI> as at <HI>Norwich,</HI> at <HI>Ip&s;wich,</HI> at <HI>Col|cbe&s;ter,</HI> at <HI>Canterbury,</HI> at <HI>Exeter,</HI> and in &s;everal other places, and brought over with them&s;elves the complete knowledge of the Woollen Manufac|tures, and People al&s;o to work them; by which the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who are ju&s;tly fam'd for improving Arts rather than inventing, fell into tho&s;e Manu|factures, and having the be&s;t of the Wooll at their Hands, &s;oon out-wrought the <HI>Flemings</HI> in every particular.

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII. <HI>Of the Progre&s;s of</HI> Learning <HI>after the down|fall of the</HI> Roman <HI>Empire.</HI></HEAD>
<P>IT mu&s;t be acknowledge that Learning and Philo&s;ophy flouri&s;h'd in the times of the <HI>Ro|man</HI> and <HI>Grecian</HI> Empires; Hi&s;tory is full of it, the Works of <HI>Plutarch, Xenophon, Homer,</HI> and others, among the <HI>Greeks,</HI> and of <HI>Virgil, Horace, Lucan, Juvenal, Cicero, Seneca,</HI> and &s;everal o|thers, among the <HI>Latines,</HI> are &s;tanding Monu|ments of the &s;oundne&s;s of their Knowledge, the beauty of their Language, their Oratory, Poetry, and other Excellencies in tho&s;e polite Times.</P>
<P>WHEN the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire became Chri&s;tian, their Learning exerted it&s;elf another way: The primitive Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hops apply'd them&s;elves to religious Studies. The Philo&s;ophy of the Anti|ents con&s;i&s;ted chiefly in Moral Precepts and Laws of Virtue, wi&s;e Sentences, and Orations in prai&s;e of their Heroes, and &s;ometimes of their Gods: The Wi&s;dom of <HI>Athens,</HI> con&s;i&s;ted in the grave old Men reading Lectures of good Manners, and good Morals; and <HI>Seneca,</HI> that learned and really wi&s;e <HI>Roman,</HI> is pictur'd to us, when bleeding to Death in a warm Bath, dictating his Morals to his Scholars. To be bred thus at the Feet of <HI>Ga|maliel</HI> was the utmo&s;t of what they call'd polite and liberal Education; for as to Languages they made no u&s;e of them. When <HI>Strabo</HI> and <HI>Plutarch</HI> wrote, the World &s;poke <HI>Greek;</HI> to write in <HI>Greek</HI> at that time was to write to all Mankind. When <HI>Se|neca</HI>
<PB N="217" REF="230">
wrote, and <HI>Cicero</HI> pleaded, <HI>Latin</HI> was the univer&s;al Character, all the <HI>Roman</HI> World, which in &s;hort was it, all the known World &s;poke then, and as a late Poem well expre&s;&s;es it, they &s;poke and wrote in their Mother Tongue.</P>
<P>YET the <HI>Romans</HI> excell'd in every thing which was then call'd Learning; their Orators &s;poke excellently well, and charm'd the Souls of tho&s;e they &s;poke to: <HI>Ciceronian Latin</HI> is a proverbial Expre&s;&s;ion to this Day, intimating how nobly <HI>Cicero</HI> &s;poke, and that the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue was in its utmo&s;t perfection in his time, and he a com|pleat Ma&s;ter of it.</P>
<P>ALL this was under the <HI>Graecian</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> Go|vernments when really Pagan: But was Learning lo&s;t by the introduction of Religion? No, ju&s;t the contrary; <HI>Origen</HI> taught Philo&s;ophy in the public School at <HI>Antioch;</HI> and <HI>Cyprian</HI> read Divinity and Philo&s;ophy al&s;o to his Pupils at <HI>Carthage:</HI> They not only abounded in Wi&s;dom and Piety, but in Knowledge and Learning: After tho&s;e Times, upon the declining of the <HI>Roman</HI> Empire, when Learning began to decay, the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue was corrupted and lo&s;t, and that which once all the World &s;poke was &s;unk out of the World, only as it was to be found in the Writ|ings of the Antients; hence it became nece&s;&s;ary, that all tho&s;e that would read the Writings of the Fathers, mu&s;t be able to &s;peak the <HI>Latin</HI> Tongue in its Purity.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ent all the young Students to School; for the <HI>Latin</HI> was no where found with purity and clearne&s;s, but in the Books written by the Anti|ents, &s;uch as tho&s;e we now call the Cla&s;&s;icks. Thus it was likewi&s;e with the <HI>Jews,</HI> as to the <HI>Hebrew;</HI> for the Children of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> or of <HI>Judah</HI> rather, being &s;eventy Years in Captivity in <HI>Ba|bylon,</HI> they forgot their Country &s;o much, that
<PB N="218" REF="231">
they forgot their original <HI>Hebrew,</HI> and all &s;poke the <HI>Chaldee,</HI> the Speech of the <HI>Babylonians,</HI> and &s;o afterwards the <HI>Greek;</HI> the antient <HI>Hebrew</HI> was only to be found in the <HI>Talmud,</HI> and in the Writ|ings of their <HI>Rabbies,</HI> whence it was call'd <HI>Rabbi|nical Hebrew;</HI> and tho&s;e who afterwards de&s;ir'd to &s;peak or read <HI>Hebrew,</HI> were &s;ent to the Schools of their Doctors and Rabbies to learn it.</P>
<P>HENCE the knowledge of the Tongues, as of the <HI>Latin, Greek,</HI> and <HI>Hebrew,</HI> is call'd Learning, and he that under&s;tands, or is Ma&s;ter of tho&s;e Tongues is call'd a Man of Learning; and in our Days if a Man under&s;tands all the other Languages &s;poken in <HI>Europe,</HI> if he is Ma&s;ter of Science, and un|der&s;tands A&s;tronomy, Geography, and all the other Branches of the Mathematicks; if he had read all the Civil, or Eccle&s;ia&s;tic, Sacred, or Prophane Hi&s;tory, were an exqui&s;ite Engineer, or a com|pleat Navigator, yet if he has not the <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> he is no Scholar; which by the way is a gro&s;s Error in the common Judgment.</P>
<P>HAVING thus mention'd the Learning of tho&s;e Times, I come next to examine the Theory of Philo&s;ophy in all that time receiv'd in the World, all the knowledge of the motions of the heavenly Bodies, their Magnitude, Di&s;tances, In|fluences, begun among the <HI>Chaldeans</HI> and <HI>Per&s;ians,</HI> carry'd on and encrea&s;ed among the Ea&s;tern <HI>Arabi|ans,</HI> and con&s;ummate and compleat among the South; from whence it launch'd out into <HI>Egypt,</HI> and thence into all parts of the then known World; I &s;ay <HI>Egypt</HI> was the center of all Knowledge and Learn|ing of that kind for many Ages, and the fir&s;t Sy&s;tem of A&s;tronomy was read in their Schools, which was according to <HI>Ptolemey,</HI> and therefore call'd the <HI>Ptolemaick</HI> Sy&s;tem.</P>
<P>IN the infant &s;tate of the World this was a great point, and Men thought them&s;elves great
<PB N="219" REF="232">
proficients in Learning that could explain things by the Doctrine of <HI>Ptolemey;</HI> when all on a &s;ud|den, from the remote&s;t Angle of <HI>Europe,</HI> a Thou&s;|and or fifteen Hundred Miles from the City of <HI>Rome,</HI> up &s;tarts an ob&s;cure <HI>Polander, Nicho|las Copernicus</HI> by name, a mean Prie&s;t in the <HI>Romi&s;h</HI> Church; and he examining the <HI>former Sy&s;tem,</HI> reflects pre&s;ently that a better way, and nigher by far, to the true Sy&s;tem was known to them, and might be reduced into practice.</P>
<P><HI>COPERNICUS</HI> was accordingly, and at the fir&s;t appearance of his Scheme, accepted and re|ceiv'd, and made his Knowledge exten&s;ive to the whole World.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Copernicus</HI> &s;tudyed the thing effectually, and brought it to this perfection; that he rejected the whole <HI>Ptolemaic Sy&s;tem,</HI> gave a new Scheme of the heavenly Bodies, their Motions and Di&s;tances, and gave &s;uch Demon&s;trations of what he &s;aid, and e&s;pecially &s;o ea&s;ily &s;olv'd &s;everal Difficulties and Incon&s;i&s;tencies, which were at lea&s;t not &s;olv|able by the old Sy&s;tem, that, in a word, the whole World are now come with him to reject the old <HI>Ptolemaic Sy&s;tem</HI> and embrace the <HI>New Philo|&s;ophy.</HI></P>
<P>IT was indeed at fir&s;t ridiculed and laugh'd at; Men could not &s;o &s;oon come off from the no|tion of the ri&s;ing and &s;etting of the Sun, which had been almo&s;t 4000 Years the received Opinion of the whole Earth, nay, was even read in the &s;tyle of the Scripture; nor could they entertain any thought of the Earth rolling on upon the Poles of the Ecliptic, with the &s;urprizing veloci|ty of 21000 Miles in twenty four Hours; and yet we who live upon the Surface of it be no way &s;en&s;ible of its moving, much le&s;s di&s;turb'd with it;
<PB N="220" REF="233">
I &s;ay, it was look'd upon as ab&s;ur'd; and we find this homely Di&s;tich upon record again&s;t it;</P>
<Q><L>Copernicus <HI>this new wild Fiction found,</HI></L>
<L><HI>To make the Sun &s;tand &s;till, and the World go round.</HI></L></Q>
<P>BUT however they receiv'd it, the force of its Rea&s;oning prevail'd, and in a few Ages the whole World came into it; thus the <HI>Ptolemaic Sy&s;tem</HI> was rejected as impracticable and ab&s;urd; and this has been the receiv'd Philo&s;ophy ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Copernicus</HI> was born in the City of <HI>Thorn</HI> in the <HI>Poli&s;h Pru&s;&s;ia,</HI> a City on the <HI>Vi&s;tula,</HI> and the fir&s;t that has a Bridge over it from the Sea to that place; he was a Divine, and a Phy&s;ician, as well as a Philo&s;opher; for he was a Canon of the Cathedral Church at <HI>Warmia</HI> in <HI>Pru&s;&s;ia;</HI> but prin|cipally delighted with the &s;tudy of the heavenly Bodies, he travel'd to <HI>Italy,</HI> and at <HI>Rome</HI> &s;et up his new Philo&s;ophy, and taught it in a kind of Mathematic Accademy, where he &s;oon got many Followers: He was born in the Year 1473; his Hypothe&s;is was &s;aid to be fir&s;t fram'd by an antient <HI>Greek</HI> A&s;tronomer <HI>Ari&s;tarchus;</HI> and that <HI>Copernicus</HI> only reviv'd it; but it is evident if he did &s;o, he much improv'd it al&s;o, and therefore it de&s;ervedly bears his Name: His Doctrine of the heavenly Bodies is as follows.</P>
<P><HI>COPERNICUS</HI> makes the Sun the center of the Univer&s;e, and holds 'tis immoveable. <HI>Mer|cury,</HI> the next Planet to the Sun, compleats its Circle about it in three Months. <HI>Venus</HI> runs her Circle, which environs that of <HI>Mercury,</HI> in &s;even Months and a half; the Earth hers in a Circle that comprehends that of <HI>Venus,</HI> in a Year, but has another motion upon or round its own Axis, which is diurnal of twenty four Hours, and is that by which we explain the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Days and
<PB N="221" REF="234">
Nights. The <HI>Moon</HI> rolls about the Earth, and compleats hers in twenty &s;even Days, or there|abouts. <HI>Mars</HI> in a fourth Circle comes round that of the Earth, and has the Sun for the Center, the time of its Revolution being about two Years. <HI>Jupiter</HI> in about twelve Years. <HI>Saturn,</HI> the high|e&s;t of all the Planets, makes its turn about the Sun in thirty Years, or thereabouts. Above <HI>Saturn Copernicus</HI> places the Starry Heaven, (which is mo|tionle&s;s in his Opinion. [To re&s;ume his Senti|ments of the re&s;t] the Sun is immoveable, and in the Center of the World. <HI>Mercury, Venus,</HI> the <HI>Earth, Mars, Jupiter,</HI> and <HI>Saturn,</HI> move in their &s;ix Circles round the Sun: But the Earth has another Motion on its own Axis, and the Moon makes its circuit round the Earth. By this Sy&s;tem we avoid the difficulty of explaining and giving Rea&s;ons for the daily motion of the Sun in an immen&s;e &s;pace, and with an unconceivable rapi|dity. But tho' <HI>Copernicus</HI> places the Sun in the center of the World, and allows it no motion, &s;o as not to change one place for another; yet his Followers give it a circular Motion round its Axis, and &s;ay this Revolution is compleated in twenty &s;even Days: This they do to explain the appearances of Stains or Spots that have been di&s;covered by Tele&s;copes or Per&s;pective-Gla&s;&s;es in its Body, but are ob&s;erved to change their Situa|tion in twenty &s;even Days. As for the Earth <HI>Copernicus</HI> gives it three Motions: <HI>The fir&s;t,</HI> That it compleats in a Day; <HI>The &s;econd,</HI> The Yearly; And <HI>the third,</HI> Which always keeps the Earth's Axis in the &s;ame Po&s;ition. The <HI>Diurnal</HI> Revolu|tion is, that which the Earth makes in twenty four Hours upon its own Axis; &s;o that the part that is towards the Sun is always enlighten'd, whil&s;t the other lies dark. The Annual is, that the Earth runs through the Signs of the <HI>Zodiack,</HI> when be|tween
<PB N="222" REF="235">
<HI>Venus</HI> and <HI>Mars</HI> it take its round about the Sun in a Years time: The third &s;erves to give Rea&s;on for the difference of Sea&s;ons, and the ine|quality of Days in different Climates.</P>
<P>IT is true that &s;everal Learned Men had made E&s;&s;ays of this kind; the <HI>Primum Mobile</HI> of <HI>Ptolemy</HI> confounded them, it was impo&s;&s;ible to conceive regularly of them, or to bring any Demon&s;trati|ons of the Fact that were con&s;i&s;tent; they were forced to re&s;olve all difficulties of things into Om|nipotence; Tele&s;copes, and more perfect Gla&s;&s;es than had been then found, di&s;cover'd things formerly unknown; as particularly the motion of the Sun round its own Axis in twenty &s;even Days, by &s;eeing the Spots and Marks di&s;cover'd in the Body of the Sun change their &s;ituation, and come into the &s;ame place every twenty &s;eventh Day; di&s;|covering the Satellites or Moons about the Planets, and their Revolutions and Eclip&s;es; the Winds, Tides, and &s;everal other Phaenomenas, of which the Antients had little or no knowledge, or at lea&s;t could not &s;olve the Difficulties that aro&s;e from them.</P>
<P>THIS has been the ground plat of va&s;t Im|provement in Science, which we may take occa|&s;ion to mention hereafter in this Hi&s;tory, and particularly of the famous <HI>Tycho Brahe,</HI> the King of <HI>Denmark</HI>'s A&s;tronomer Royal, who form'd a third Sy&s;tem different from both the&s;e; But Death taking him off before he had brought it to perfec|tion, the World, tho' they honour him as a great Man, yet have not receiv'd his Sy&s;tem, or improv'd upon it. But <HI>Copernicus</HI> has employ'd all the Learned Men for now 200 Years to go on improving upon his Sy&s;tem, and the&s;e having re|mov'd all po&s;&s;ible Objections that were then, or have &s;ince been rais'd; this is now the receiv'd Philo&s;ophy, upon the foot of which, all the fine

Experiments of the pre&s;ent and la&s;t Age have been rais'd.</P>
<P>FROM hence I mu&s;t pa&s;s to another perfectly new Invention or Improvement, which the World owes to the &s;ame Northern Climate, tho' not the &s;ame Country as the other; namely, the Art of Printing. The other indeed is an exalted Science, but this may bear as ju&s;t a Preheminence in Arts, and among the modern Improvements of Art, as that does in Science: This was the Invention of one <HI>Ko&s;ter</HI> at <HI>Harlem,</HI> where certainly the fir&s;t Experiment that was in the World, was made. It is true that <HI>Guttemburgh</HI> and <HI>Fau&s;tus,</HI> both of them Servants to this <HI>Ko&s;ter</HI> the fir&s;t Inventor, went from him, and &s;pread the Invention, the one to the City of <HI>Ments</HI> in <HI>Germany,</HI> and the other to <HI>Paris;</HI> and there practi&s;ing it as their own, gain'd for &s;ome time the name of being the fir&s;t Inventors, and <HI>Ments</HI> contends the point with <HI>Harlem</HI> to this Day; as for <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> he own'd him&s;elf afterwards not to be the Inventor; to which there hangs a Tale which few People perhaps have heard, and therefore may be acceptable to the Reader, &s;ince &s;o much noi&s;e has been made of this &s;uprizing Fellow in the World.</P>
<P>ALL Books being before only Manu&s;cripts on Rolls of Parchments, Vellum, &amp;c. and con&s;e|quently both &s;carce and dear, and <HI>Fau&s;tus</HI> having printed a large Impre&s;&s;ion of the P&s;alter, with &s;ome Books of the New Te&s;tament, goes away with them to <HI>Paris,</HI> to &s;ell them there as <HI>Manu|&s;cripts;</HI> and accordingly &s;old &s;everal of them, and had an extraordinary price for them as &s;uch: But &s;ome Learned Men of the Faculty, at <HI>Paris</HI> viewing the&s;e P&s;alters with &s;ome admiration, were &s;urpriz'd to ob&s;erve that there was an unaccount|able uniformity in the Performance.</P>

WITH the invention of Printing came on the invention of Paper al&s;o. It had been u&s;ed be|fore; but as it was but a few Years it met with great encouragment upon the &s;preading of the Art of Printing: It began at <HI>Ba&s;il</HI> on the Fron|tiers of <HI>Switzerland,</HI> was invented there, or brought thither by two <HI>Greeks,</HI> and was there made fir&s;t in great plenty, till at la&s;t they &s;uffer'd other Towns to &s;ee them do it al&s;o; and &s;o the Manufacture went from them to other places in <HI>Germany,</HI> and &s;o by degrees to <HI>Genoa</HI> in <HI>Italy,</HI> to <HI>France,</HI> and to <HI>Holland,</HI> and is now made in all the Nations of <HI>Europe,</HI> and in <HI>A&s;ia</HI> al&s;o.</P>
<P>IT is to be ob&s;erv'd, that at the &s;ame time that the&s;e things were doing, the World &s;eem'd to rouze up to a &s;tate of Indu&s;try and Application, from a &s;tate of the greate&s;t Indolence and Ignorance.</P>
<P>THE truth is, till now the Indu&s;try of the World had nothing to work upon; the lovers of Art had nothing but mere Nature to teach them; <HI>Copernicus</HI> him&s;elf knew nothing of the true Di|&s;tances and Magnitudes of the Planets, which by the help of our Tele&s;copes (an Invention of &s;o truly &s;trange a nature) we are &s;ince arriv'd to: The Diameter of the Sun, the Ring and Satellites about <HI>Saturn,</HI> the whole Solar Sy&s;tem, were all out of his reach; in &s;hort, tho' he made a right gue&s;s, and con&s;idering the Circum&s;tances it was a won|derful gue&s;s too; yet all was in the dark, and the demon&s;trations of things are generally Modern.</P>
<P><HI>EUCLID</HI> and his Elements are all modern; <HI>Archimedes</HI> was dead, and Mathematic Knowledge &s;eem'd to have dyed with him.</P>
<P>BUT &s;till the World was fir'd with a de&s;ire of knowing; A&s;tronomy was a delightful Study. <HI>Copernicus</HI> no &s;ooner &s;et up his A&s;tronomical Lectures at <HI>Rome,</HI> but all the <HI>Virtuo&s;i</HI> of that Age flockt to him, till (if you will believe &s;ome People)
<PB N="226" REF="239">
he taught them to be Wi&s;er than him&s;elf, and they improv'd upon his Schemes in many valuable particulars, and from which we &s;ee his Schemes are much improv'd; nor was it only this Know|ledge which Men began to look into, but in the next Ages all the noble Inventions in Art, which have ju&s;tly been work'd upon &s;ince that, and &s;o much improv'd, have &s;tarted into the World; &s;uch as Geopraphy, Arithmetic, Improvements, of which the Branches are full of Variety, and the mathematical Addendus, of which they are in|finite.</P>
<P>THUS to look back a little between the Years 1400 and 1600 almo&s;t all the great and mo&s;t illu&s;trious Improvements in the &s;ublime&s;t parts of Knowledge, have been found out, or at lea&s;t extended in the&s;e parts of the World. We are told indeed, that almo&s;t all our nice&s;t Di&s;co|veries were found out, and in practice in <HI>China</HI> before they were di&s;cover'd here: This I be|lieve nothing of, and give le&s;s credit to what they talk of having &s;everal Arts which we have not. It is true their Japanning, or Lacquer, cannot be imitated, nor their China Ware, but it is want of the Materials, not want of the Skill or Know|ledge how to perform the Operation; or 'tis want of Climate for the &s;udden drying and hardning their Lacquer, and &s;o of other things.</P>
<P>As Printing was invented by <HI>Ko&s;ter</HI> in 1428, or 1430, Rag Paper in 1452, &s;o Graving, and Print|ing by the Rolling Pre&s;s was brought on in 1460, and Etching a few Years after in like manner: By the like degrees Gunpowder was the In|vention of the &s;ame Century, and Guns follow'd it clo&s;e at the Heels; it was impo&s;&s;ible that Pow|der could be known, and the force of it, and Na|ture not direct Men to fight with it.</P>
<P><PB N="227" REF="240">
AND here it is worth Ob&s;ervation, Why did not Providence permit the fir&s;t Invention of Pow|der to be &s;o appropriated to one particular Prince or Nation, that they might have conceal'd the Art of making it, or the Ingredients and Materials u&s;ed in the making, or the corning and operation of it, or the Apparatus nece&s;&s;ary for the purpo&s;e, &s;o that by this means that Prince might have conquer'd all the re&s;t of the World; for 'tis evident nothing could have &s;tood again&s;t it, or have with&s;tood the Army that &s;hou'd have had the u&s;e of it exclu&s;ive of their Enemy; but either we are entirely out in in the Hi&s;tory of it, or the di&s;covery was imme|diately made &s;o public, and improv'd in &s;o many hands, that it appear'd in the Field in &s;everal places almo&s;t at the &s;ame time; no particular Prince or Power having any extraordinary advantage by it, at lea&s;t not that I find recorded.</P>
<P>I MAKE no doubt, but that, when it came abroad in the World, and that it was thus particularly applicable to the u&s;e of the War, all the neigh|bouring Powers took care to be acquainted with the Secret, and to be furni&s;h'd with the Species; for we do not find that it was to be had in any one particular place more than another, but that it was (as it is now) made every where, the Compo&s;i|tion being pre&s;ently known, and the Materials ea&s;y to be procur'd: So true is it, that the Ingredients for a public Mi&s;chief were ea&s;y to be had, and it &s;eems the Monk, who made the Di&s;covery, was not at all cautious in keeping the Secret, but it took Wind pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>NOR is it certain whether great Cannon, or &s;maller Pieces, were the fir&s;t that were invented; if I may &s;peak my Thoughts, it was the former, &s;eeing we find that the &s;malle&s;t Gun u&s;ed in fight for &s;ome time was the Harquebu&s;s, and at fir&s;t a larger &s;ort, which they call'd Harquebu&s;s <HI>au cro$,</HI>
<PB N="228" REF="241">
becau&s;e it &s;tood upon an Iron Frame call'd <HI>a Croc,</HI> and fa&s;ten'd with a kind of Swivel, or Scrue, to the &s;aid Frame, being it&s;elf heavy and unwieldy, and too big for one Man to manage.</P>
<P>AFTER this they were made &s;maller, but yet too heavy for Soldiers to carry and to march with, and were carry'd on Hor&s;e-back, and the Harque|bu&s;iers, like Dragoons, when they came to fight, laid them cro&s;s the Saddle, and &s;o fir'd them at the Enemy, &s;tanding them&s;elves on foot by: After this they carryed Re&s;ts for them, and that conti|nued a long time, nay, it is within the Memory of Man, that all the Mu&s;queteers in the Armies had Re&s;ts for their Mu&s;quets, and all the Field Ex|erci&s;e and Words of Command were accordingly. Whether the Mu&s;quets they us'd at that time were larger and heavyer than tho&s;e now in u&s;e, I know not, but I believe they were not much larger, if any thing, but it was pretended the Soldiers took the &s;urer aim.</P>
<P>UPON all this, I am of opinion that the fir&s;t u&s;e of Gunpowder, that is to &s;ay in the Field, was in the Artillery, and the Rea&s;on which at lea&s;t guides me to this, is, that tho' they might have the u&s;e of the Gun, yet they had not of the Lock to fire it with; and it is but a very few Years (and &s;ince the Writer of this can remember) that the Firelock was not known; or if it was, it was but rarely us'd, but all the Soldiers were encum|ber'd with Match, which had innumerable lei&s;urly &s;low Inconveniences, attending it, as particularly blowing the Match, cocking the Match, trying the length, then opening the Snaphaunce, as the <HI>Dutch</HI> call'd it, much more properly call'd now the Pan, and be&s;ides this the Soldiers had an intol|lerable difficulty to keep their Match lighted, and &s;ometimes in &s;hort after Rains, or wet mi&s;ty Nights, it has been impo&s;&s;ible the Armies cou'd
<PB N="229" REF="242">
engage, tho' re&s;olv'd before to come to a Battle; and if one Side had been more careful to keep their Matches lighted, and came on, knowing them|&s;elves in good Condition, that way, the other Side have been oblig'd to retreat and &s;hun the Fight.</P>
<P>NAY, &s;o general was the u&s;e of what we call'd Match-locks to the Mu&s;quets, that &s;ince we very well remember, and very modern in Hi&s;tory, we find, that when honourable Conditions were given to a Garri&s;on, who capitulated to march out in a &s;oldierly Condition, it was always thus ex|pre&s;s'd, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Drums beating, Colours flying, Match lighted, Bullet in the Mouth, &amp;c. But now the Firelock, which is the mo&s;t modern Invention of all, is &s;o univer&s;al, that in&s;tead of tho&s;e Words in Capitulations, it is now only mention'd, that the Men &s;hall have &s;o many Charges of Powder and Ball.</P>
<P>I AM told by &s;ome, that the Improvements in the Art of War are &s;uch, and &s;o con&s;iderable, that no other Improvement can come up to them; al&s;o that the&s;e Improvements ought to take a Place in the Di&s;cour&s;e I am upon, and I grant it; but then I think the proper <HI>Ephocha</HI> to begin our Di&s;|cour&s;e upon warlike Improvements, &s;hou'd begin at the Introduction of Guns and Gunpowder; for as to what was before, it is not worth notice. The <HI>Romans</HI> embattling in Lines and deep Bodies, the <HI>Macedonian</HI> Phalanx, and other the antient Methods of drawing up Armies, as al&s;o the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> ranging their Archers and long Bows, all the&s;e wou'd require long De&s;criptions, but little to our In&s;truction; But Powder and Ball, at once put a new Face, not upon the Armies only, but upon the very War; Fire and Noi&s;e were added to the Ter|rors of the Field, things which the Soldier had never been acquainted with before.</P>
<P><PB N="230" REF="243">
FIGHTING was now become a &s;trange new Thing; When Battles were fought and Armies en|gag'd, they might be heard at the di&s;tance of many Miles; whereas before that, the loude&s;t Cries and Shouts of the Troops reach'd but a &s;mall way off; But there was &s;omething &s;tranger yet; before this Men march'd up to Battle cas'd in Steel, and made up in Greaves and Helmets, that nothing could be &s;een but the burni&s;h'd Iron; nor could you come at the the Man when you were within an Inch of his Face; but now, they began to quit their retreat behind their Iron Walls, and &s;hew the true Courage and Gallantry of a Soldier; and tho' the Bullet was much more fatal, and she Gun had much more terror in it than the Arrow, or the Bow, yet di&s;pi&s;ing Danger and &s;corning Armour, the Soldier now looks Death in the Face, and boldly ru&s;hes on, even in the Mouth of the Cannon and Mu&s;quet.</P>
<P>IT is much di&s;puted in the World, whether Fighting is more or le&s;s Terrible, and Battles more or le&s;s Bloody, &s;ince the di&s;covery of Powder and the u&s;e of Guns than before; &s;ome think Men ru&s;hing forward into Danger, and pu&s;hing up to the Teeth of their Enemy, they bring Things to a &s;horter i&s;&s;ue now than before; formerly the Infantry endur'd Showers of Arrows for many Hours &s;ometimes, before they could come to Swords points with their Enemies, &s;o that they often came up wounded and out of Breath to the Fight, and left thou&s;ands of their own Side behind them dead or di&s;abled, before the Battle could be &s;aid to be join'd; whereas now, with Fire and Thunder the Spirits of Men are immedita ey agitated into Fury, and they run on like enrag'd Lions, &s;o that one Side or other mu&s;t fly, or be cut in pieces very quickly. But this is not my bu&s;ine&s;s to en|quire here, I may have occa&s;ion to &s;peak of it
<PB N="231" REF="244">
again when I come to di&s;cour&s;e of the &s;everal Improvements which have &s;ince been made &s;ub|&s;equent to, and occa&s;ion'd by this fatal Invention; Such as,</P>
<P N="1">I. THE modern Improvements of Fortifications for Encampments of Armies, and the &s;trength|ening of Towns and Fortre&s;&s;es, quite differing from &s;uch as were known before.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE manner of approachings and attacks in Seiges and Stormings, with the numberle&s;s Improvements of the Engines of Battery, al&s;o Sapings and Countermings, all different both in attacking and defending of &s;trong Towns, from what were of u&s;e before.</P>
<P N="3">III. THE <HI>Tormentarij,</HI> or Artillery of &s;everal kinds, be&s;ides the mere Invention of Cannon; &s;uch as <HI>Mortars, Patereroes, Hawitzers, Chambers, Bombs, Carka&s;&s;es, Stinkpots, Hand Grenades, cum multis alijs,</HI> all perfectly new; and not po&s;&s;ible to be otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE Things leading us gradually to more modern Improvements, we mu&s;t adjourn them for a while, in order to bring Things more An|tient up to an even Line of Time with them; and particularly to &s;peak of the Di&s;covery of un|known Countries, as well for Conque&s;t as for Commerce; for it is to be ob&s;erv'd, that in this &s;ame Century the knowledge of Navigation en|crea&s;ing, Mens Minds were fir'd with the de&s;ire of knowing as well unknown Countries as unknown Arts; and we find the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> pu&s;hing into new and undi&s;cover'd Parts of the World, and after them the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> and as it were la&s;t of all, and out of time,
<PB N="232" REF="245">
the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>French;</HI> who&s;e u&s;eful Di&s;coveries however, have by their extraordinary Application been &s;ucce&s;sfully encreas'd to a Magnitude in &s;ome degrees equal, if not &s;uperior to them all, as we &s;hall fully make out in its place.</P>
<P>THE knowledge of the Magnet or Load&s;tone, and in Con&s;equence of it, the Compa&s;s were a|mong the Improvements of the fifteenth Century, the Hi&s;tory of them I re&s;erve for its proper place; the u&s;e I make of it here, and for which I mention it, is this, namely, that by this great and happy Di&s;covery Mankind was infinitely encreas'd in Knowledge; and which was as much as all the re&s;t, they were in&s;pir'd with a de&s;ire after knowing more.</P>
<P>TILL then, <HI>like</HI> Solomon's <HI>Fool,</HI> they &s;eem'd to have no delight in under&s;standing that they &s;eem'd to know but little but to be &s;atisfied in their &s;tate of Ignorance, and not de&s;ire or at lea&s;t not to &s;earch after an encrea&s;e of Knowledge, perhaps they believ'd, or at lea&s;t fancy'd they could know no more than they did.</P>
<P>BUT now having open'd a Door into the va&s;t Ocean of Mathematical Knowledge, it fir'd their Souls with a happy de&s;ire of of knowing more; I &s;ay fir'd, becau&s;e Mankind has ever &s;ince had an unquenchible Thir&s;t after the compleat Di&s;covery of Nature, and the highe&s;t degree of acquir'd Knowledge, and an indefatigable Application to farther and farther Improvements in Arts and Soience; in a word, in all po&s;&s;ible Degrees of Learning and Knowledge.</P>

<P>AS I have noted already, the World about the twelfth Century was in but a poor Condi|tion, as to <HI>Trade</HI> or <HI>Navigation;</HI> nor indeed were they much better in all matters of u&s;eful Know|ledge; Mankind &s;eem'd to be in general, &s;tor'd with no other Knowledge than Nature and Nece&s;&s;ity immediately dictated.

<P>IN the&s;e narrow Circum&s;tances &s;tood the frame of the World's Knowledge at the beginning of the fifteenth Century, and when Men of Genius began to look abroad, and about 'em. Now, as it was wonderful to &s;ee a World &s;o full of People, and People &s;o capable of Improvement, be yet &s;o Stu|pid and &s;o blind, &s;o ignorant, and &s;o perfectly unimprov'd; &s;o it was as wonderful to &s;ee with what a general Alacrity they took the Alarm al|mo&s;t all together, preparing them&s;elves as it were on a &s;udden, or by a general Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion or rather In&s;piration to &s;pread Knowledge through the Earth,
<PB N="238" REF="252">
and to &s;earch into every thing that it was po&s;&s;ible to know.</P>
<P>How &s;urprizing is it for us to look back &s;o little away behind us, and &s;ee, that even in le&s;s than two hundred Years all this (now &s;o Self-wi&s;e) part of the World did not &s;o much as know whether there was any &s;uch Place as a <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> a <HI>Mu&s;covy,</HI> a <HI>China,</HI> a <HI>Guinea,</HI> a <HI>Greenland,</HI> or a <HI>North-Cape?</HI> that as to <HI>America,</HI> it was never &s;uppos'd there was any &s;uch Place, neither had the World, tho' they &s;tood up|on the Shoulders of 4000 Years Experience, the lea&s;t thought, &s;o much as that there was any Land that way.</P>
<P>As they were ignorant of Places, &s;o of Things al&s;o. How va&s;t are the Improvements of Science, that all our Knowledge, either of Mathematicks or of Nature, or of the brighte&s;t part of human Wi&s;dom have their Admi&s;&s;ion among us in the&s;e two la&s;t Centuries?</P>
<P>WHAT was the World before? And to what were the Heads and Hands of Mankind applyed? The Rich had no Commerce, the Poor no Employ|ment; War and the Sword was the great Field of Honour, and the Stage of Preferment; and you have &s;carce a Man eminent in the World for any thing before that Time, but for a furious outragi|ous falling upon his fellow Creatures, like <HI>Nimrod</HI> and his Succe&s;&s;ors of modern Fame.</P>
<P>WHERE were the Men that arriv'd to Cha|racters, to Fame, and to Di&s;tinction, by Trade, by the Mathematicks, by the Knowledge of natu|ral or experimental Philo&s;ophy? Where was the Sir <HI>Walter Raleighs,</HI> the <HI>Verulams,</HI> the <HI>Boyls,</HI> or <HI>Newtons</HI> of tho&s;e Ages? Nature being not enquir'd into, di&s;cover'd none of her Secrets to them, they neither knew, or &s;ought to know, what now is the Fountain of all human Knowledge, and the great

Mi&s;tery for the Wi&s;e&s;t Men to &s;earch into, I mean <HI>Nature.</HI></P>
<P>AS then the World are arriv'd to the height of human Knowledge, which we now &s;ee among them, and the improvements of Mankind are &s;o infinitely greater, in the&s;e two la&s;t Centuries, than they were for &s;o many Years before; let us go in the gradual Enquiry, and give the Hi&s;tory of them as briefly as we can. It mu&s;t be matter of wonder to this Age, and all the Ages to come, to look back and &s;ee how poorly the World went on for &s;o many thou&s;and Years, and even &s;o very near the Heels of our Times; and I make no que&s;tion but that, after Ages, &s;o great are the Di&s;coveries that are &s;till behind, will be as much a&s;toni&s;h'd at the Dulne&s;s and Ignorance of this Age, as we are at that of the Years behind us.</P>
<P>HOW may they hereafter, when &s;ome effectual Method for a&s;certaining the Longitude of the Globe &s;hall be di&s;cover'd to them, admire at our Stupi|dity in not being able to find it out &s;ooner? as much as we admire at the Ignorance and Stupidity even of the great Sir <HI>Francis Drake,</HI> and that yet greater Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> who&s;e Geography was &s;o weak, and &s;o &s;hort &s;ighted, notwith&s;tanding they had the u&s;e of the Compa&s;s, and knew that the Earth and Sea together mu&s;t be one united Globe, that they &s;hou'd run away to the South|ward as far as the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands, and then &s;tand over We&s;t to the <HI>Caribbee</HI> I&s;lands, then North through the Gulph of <HI>Florida,</HI> and &s;o coa&s;t along the Shore of that we now call <HI>Carolina</HI> to find out the Coa&s;t of <HI>Virginia,</HI> a Voyage almo&s;t a thou&s;and Leagues about.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame manner, and with no le&s;s folly, did all our well skill'd Navigators, both <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Spani&s;h,</HI> even to this very Age, puzzle and perplex them&s;elves, and with infinite trouble,

<P>THUS the World is daily encrea&s;ing, particu|larly in experimental Knowledge; and let no Man flatter the Age with pretending we are arriv'd to a perfection of Di&s;coveries.

<Q><P><HI>What's yet di&s;cover'd, only &s;erves to &s;how,</HI></P>
<P><HI>How little's known,</HI> to what <HI>there's yet</HI> to know.</P></Q>
<P>BUT to go back to the &s;tate of the World in the fourteenth and fifteenth Century, and to the narrow Circum&s;tances of their Knowledge either in Trade or Navigation.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> were the fir&s;t con&s;iderable Ad|venturers that we meet with who began to look abroad for new Di&s;coveries, and to plant new Co|lonies, that is to &s;ay in the Ocean. The <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> have it &s;eems made &s;ome efforts on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> the <HI>Palus Maeotis,</HI> and the Straights of <HI>Caffa,</HI> where they had planted &s;ome People either at or about <HI>A&s;oph,</HI> and the Mouth of the great Ri|ver <HI>Don</HI> or <HI>Tanais,</HI> and the <HI>Bory&s;thenes.</HI> For Ex|ample;</P>
<P>THE <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> di&s;cover'd and planted for them|&s;elves the <HI>Taurica Cher&s;one&s;us,</HI> that is to &s;ay the Country between the great River <HI>Bory&s;thenes</HI> and
<PB N="241" REF="255">
the Straights of <HI>Caffa,</HI> and which is now call'd the <HI>Crim-Tartary;</HI> and the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> being &s;trong at Sea po&s;&s;e&s;t all this Country, then very fruitful and rich; till the <HI>Turks</HI> &s;pread them&s;elves into <HI>Europe,</HI> and finally taking <HI>Con&s;tantinople</HI> &s;hut the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> out of the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> not &s;uffering any Chri&s;tian Ve&s;&s;els to pa&s;s the <HI>Bo&s;phorus,</HI> no not to this Day.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e Colonies the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> were &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful and &s;o &s;trong that they built many Cities, and e&s;pecially Sea-ports, as <HI>Caffa</HI> in particular, on the great Straight or Entrance into the <HI>Palus Maeotis;</HI> which from that Sea is call'd the Straight of <HI>Caf|fa</HI> to this Day; and tho' the <HI>Genoe&s;e</HI> were &s;hut out of the <HI>Euxine Sea,</HI> by the <HI>Turks,</HI> as above, about the Year 1450, yet they kept their footing in the <HI>Cher&s;one&s;us,</HI> and particularly this Port of <HI>Caffa,</HI> till the Year 1574.</P>
<P>BUT the State of <HI>Genoa</HI> having been &s;unk from all their navigating Glory, and reduc'd to the &s;mall confines of their pre&s;ent Dominions in <HI>Italy;</HI> all their <HI>Ea&s;tern</HI> Colonies are devour'd by the <HI>Turks;</HI> and they are not now worth naming in the World, I mean as to Improvement and Plantation.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> as I noted before, were the Nation of all the Nations in the World, who fir&s;t looked abroad in the World for Di&s;coveries. <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> an a&s;piring and enterpriz|ing Prince, hearing that the <HI>Spaniards</HI> had by the height of the <HI>Pico Teneriffe</HI> di&s;cover'd the <HI>Canary</HI> I&s;lands, and taken Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them, &s;ent out three Ships under the direction of <HI>John Gonzales</HI> and <HI>Tri&s;|trian-Vaz,</HI> two experienc'd Mariners, in order to find if there were any more I&s;lands in tho&s;e Seas; and the&s;e very happily di&s;cover'd and took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the I&s;land of <HI>Madera,</HI> in the Year 1420, which has remain'd to the King of <HI>Portugal</HI> ever &s;ince.</P>
<P>IN the &s;ame fortuitous manner <HI>Don Henry</HI> Prince of <HI>Portugal</HI> di&s;cover'd the <HI>Azores,</HI> or, as &s;ome call

them the <HI>Tercera</HI> I&s;lands; a <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Ship being dri|ven to the We&s;tward by a Storm, as they were on their way to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> fell in with the&s;e I&s;lands, and runing in for &s;helter, and in hopes of relief, found Harbour indeed, but no relief, for the I&s;lands were all uninhabited. After &s;ome &s;tay, and the Wind coming about fair, the <HI>Flemings</HI> &s;et &s;ail, and coming to <HI>Lisbon</HI> gave an account of the Place where they had been; <HI>Don Henry,</HI> above nam'd, taking the hint, and de&s;iring them as well as they could to de&s;cribe the &s;ituation, went to Sea in five Ships, and happily di&s;cover'd the place, which he like|wi&s;e &s;eiz'd for the King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> who cau&s;ed 'em to be planted and inhabited, and the <HI>Portu|gue&s;e</HI> have been Lords of them ever &s;ince; this was in 1449.</P>
<P>ENCOURAG'D by the&s;e Di&s;coveries <HI>John</HI> King of <HI>Portugal</HI> re&s;olv'd upon more: And having &s;ome very experienc'd Navigators in his Service; I mean experienc'd as the World then went, among whom was <HI>Anthony Nola</HI> a <HI>Genoe&s;e, Bartholomew Diaz</HI> a <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> and &s;everal others; they put him upon making Di&s;coveries on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa.</HI> But King <HI>John</HI> dying in 1433, and his Son <HI>Edward</HI> reigning but five Years, the&s;e Adven|tures were not pu&s;h'd on effectually till the Reign of <HI>Alfon&s;o</HI> the fifth, Grand&s;on to King <HI>John,</HI> who engaged in them again.</P>
<P>HE began at Cape <HI>Spartel,</HI> the very Mouth of the Straights, and embarking a good Body of Troops in his Ships, &s;ent them to invade <HI>Africa,</HI> and plant Colonies; in con&s;equence of which Com|mi&s;&s;ion they took <HI>Tangier</HI> and <HI>Arzilla,</HI> and forti|fying them, left &s;trong Garri&s;ons there. Then they proceeded upon the We&s;tern Coa&s;t forward to the South, till at length they &s;eiz'd upon a &s;mall old <HI>Saracen</HI> Town, almo&s;t dwindled back in|to the original of Nature, and turn'd &s;avage again;
<PB N="243" REF="257">
however they found a good Port, and which in all appearance had been formerly in more reque&s;t, and better frequented than it was at that time; for the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> found no Genius for Trade yet among them, or that any other Nation corre&s;pond|ed with them. This Port the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> gladly &s;eated them&s;elves in, fortified it, and call'd it <HI>Santa Cruz.</HI></P>
<P>IN pur&s;uit of tho&s;e important Di&s;coveries, they took many Places, but were afterwards, by the unhappy Mi&s;carriage of their great Expedition under <HI>Don Seba&s;tian,</HI> the next King of <HI>Portugal,</HI> driven out of them all again. This Prince, with a powerful Army, in which was the flower of all the Nobility of <HI>Portugal,</HI> gloriou&s;ly pu&s;h'd at a Con|que&s;t of the whole <HI>Moori&s;h</HI> Empire, but lo&s;t the Battle, and was him&s;elf kill'd; in con&s;equence of that Victory, <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> they were again driven out of all the&s;e Conque&s;ts <HI>Anno</HI> 1530. But to go back to their Sea Affairs. Their &s;ucce&s;s at <HI>Santa Cruz</HI> led the fortunate <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> on to &s;earch farther South till they came to a noted Cape, which from the greene&s;s and plea&s;ant pro&s;pect of the Land they call'd <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> or <HI>Green-Cape;</HI> and here (at the &s;ame time overjoy'd with their Succe&s;s) &s;tretch|ing out into the main Sea, they found the I&s;lands, call'd by the &s;ame Rule the <HI>Cape de Verd I&s;lands.</HI></P>
<P>THIS Di&s;covery &s;atisfy'd them for the pre&s;ent; and it took them up &s;ome time to plant and &s;ettle on the&s;e I&s;lands, they being immediately valuable to the <HI>Portugu&s;e;</HI> nor have they any cau&s;e to repent their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them at all, if it were only for the Salt they get there, which &s;o many Ships are $oaded with every Year, and of which there is yet no Diminution.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> having, as above, lo&s;t their $ir&s;t Colonies on the We&s;tern Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and $articularly the Port of <HI>Santa Cruz,</HI> or <HI>Holy-Cro&s;s,</HI>

but having in pur&s;uit of the humour for Di&s;coveries, which then &s;eem'd to agitate their Nation, found out the <HI>Cape de Verd,</HI> and kept a long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of that Coa&s;t; &s;o that they were too &s;trong there to be attackt by the <HI>Moors,</HI> even when they re-took their other Conque&s;ts; they from thence extended them&s;elves all along that which we now call the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea,</HI> and &s;eiz'd the Mouth of the great River <HI>Niger,</HI> which they call'd the <HI>Rio Grande,</HI> or the <HI>Great River;</HI> a Name which intimated that the World was not then much acquainted with the cour&s;e of Rivers; for this was indeed but one of the &s;everal Branches, by which the truly <HI>Grand Niger</HI> empties it&s;elf into the Sea.</P>
<P>THEN they took the Coa&s;t of <HI>Sierra Leon,</HI> or as now vulgarly call'd <HI>Serraloon,</HI> but named by them the <HI>Hill of Lions,</HI> from a di&s;covery, that the Country on that Coa&s;t was very full of <HI>Lions;</HI> which might be &s;o at that time, tho' it &s;eems now to be as empty of Lions as any part of <HI>Afric.</HI></P>
<P>HERE the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> fortify'd: And tho' they did not build Towns and Cities, as they afterwards did farther <HI>South,</HI> yet they built Forts, &s;ettled Factories, and traded with the Natives for &s;uch things as the Country produc'd; namely, Elephants Teeth, Skins of Bea&s;ts, &s;uch as Lions and Leopards, for other Skins they had none; al&s;o <HI>Tammerins,</HI> or <HI>Guinea-Grains,</HI> Civet and Civet Cats, but e&s;peci|ally Bees-Wax: As for Slaves they had none, nei|ther did the <HI>Negroes</HI> &s;ell one another then, as they do now, neither had the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> any Colonies in <HI>America</HI> to di&s;po&s;e of them to, &s;o that the Slave Trade was not at that time begun, nor had they found any Gold at that time, or not much of it.</P>
<P>IMPATIENT of farther Advantages in a Country which they found fruitful and rich be|yond expectation; they went on and di&s;cover'd all the Coa&s;t, running from <HI>We&s;t</HI> to <HI>Ea&s;t,</HI> in the Lati|tude

of eight to four. A Climate, which by its exce&s;ive Heat, &s;eem'd to promi&s;e neither Product or People: For in tho&s;e Days, or at lea&s;t till tho&s;e Days, the Torrid Zone was always thought to be uninhabited; but to their &s;urpri&s;e they found it rich in both.</P>
<P>THEIR fir&s;t Di&s;covery was made by <HI>Anthony Nola,</HI> a <HI>Genoe&s;e,</HI> who rang'd the whole Coa&s;ts, call'd now the <HI>Grain Coa&s;t,</HI> the <HI>Gold-Coa&s;t,</HI> and the <HI>Slave-Coa&s;t,</HI> and wintered at the I&s;land of St. <HI>Thomas,</HI> or as they call it St. <HI>Thoma,</HI> an I&s;land &s;ituate directly under the Equinoctial Line; a thing &s;urprizing and a&s;toni&s;hing at that time.</P>
<P>THIS I&s;land being di&s;cover'd on St. <HI>Thomas's-Day,</HI> they call'd it by his Name St. <HI>Thomas:</HI> It was di&s;cover'd, I &s;ay, on St. <HI>Thomas</HI>'s<HI>-Day, Anno</HI> 1471, and has been in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> ever &s;ince, being very u&s;eful in their Voyages from the <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> to the <HI>Cape of Good-Hope,</HI> in their way to the <HI>Indies,</HI> and to take in fre&s;h Water and fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, as our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Ships do at the I&s;land of St. <HI>Helena,</HI> in their Voyages to the &s;ame Place.</P>
<P>UPON this wonderful di&s;covery of the South-Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> found &s;uch a va&s;t quantity of Gold upon all the Country, which we now call the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinoa,</HI> or the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t,</HI> that it enrich'd the whole Kingdom of <HI>Portugal;</HI> and it was &s;o very remarkable, that for forty or fifty Years it was call'd the Golden Age at <HI>Lisbon;</HI> till about the Year 1536, when the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> came into a &s;hare with the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> for this beneficial Trade.

that charge they did it by mere trading with the Natives in &s;uch Places where they could find con|venient Places to corre&s;pond with them; here they made great Advantages by the Commerce, and frequently brought home one hundred to one hun|dred and twenty Pounds of Gold upon a Voyage; which as Gold then bore a great Price, was a pro|digious Cargo: For &s;elling at &s;ix Pound per Ounce, the quantity of Gold amounted to &s;eventy two Pounds per Pound; &s;o that they frequently made from eight to ten or twelve thou&s;and Pounds a Voyage in Gold, be&s;ides their other Goods, as mention'd before.</P>
<P>AMONG the re&s;t we read of &s;ome <HI>French</HI> Mer|chants who with two Ships and a Bark went on that Coa&s;t, in the Year 1556, and brought away &s;even hundred Pounds weight in Gold in one Voyage, be&s;ides Tamerins, Elephants Teeth, and about fifty Slaves, (for Slaves were not bought and &s;old then, I &s;ay, as they are now;) and be&s;ides many other Goods, the Gold alone amounting to 50400 <HI>l.</HI> Sterling, an immen&s;e Sum in tho&s;e Times: And our Countryman Mr. <HI>Tower&s;on,</HI> one of the fir&s;t <HI>Engli&s;h|men</HI> who ever went thither on a trading account, brought away in three Voyages with two &s;mall Ships, each Voyage above four hundred and &s;ixty Pounds weight of Gold, be&s;ides what his Men, to whom he gave certain Liberties of trading for them|&s;elves, brought off on account of private Trade.</P>
<P>BUT the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> who, as I have &s;aid, fir&s;t di&s;cover'd this Coa&s;t, took <HI>Livery</HI> and <HI>Sei&s;in,</HI> and &s;ettled Factories, fortify'd tho&s;e Factories with &s;trong Forts and Ca&s;tles, for defending their &s;aid Commerce again&s;t, not the <HI>Negroes</HI> only, but a|gain&s;t their Neighbours the <HI>Europeans,</HI> who with too much Rea&s;on they apprehended might attempt to &s;upplant and remove them; and had tho&s;e Forts and Ca&s;tles been as well furni&s;hed with Garri&s;ons

<P>IT was a very unhappy Juncture for <HI>Portugal</HI> that their Country fell at that time into the po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Spain,</HI> as I have &s;aid; for the <HI>Dutch</HI> had no War with <HI>Portugal</HI> till <HI>Portugal</HI> became <HI>Spaniard;</HI> and in that very interval the <HI>Dutch</HI> took almo&s;t all their foreign Dominions from them, as may ap|pear in its place.</P>

con&s;iderable Fortifications, one at the Mouth of the great River or Branch of the <HI>Niger,</HI> call'd af|terwards <HI>Senegal;</HI> where the <HI>Portugueze</HI> continue &s;ettled to this Day, and where they have &s;everal little Strengths a con&s;iderable way up the River, and &s;ome well inhabited Towns, but not much Gold; if they had, their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions had not per|haps been &s;o quiet, and &s;o long.

<P>HOWEVER, tho' the <HI>Portugueze</HI> have lo&s;t all this rich Country, they did not pre&s;ently do &s;o; and tho' the <HI>Dutch</HI> encroach'd early upon them, yet they were not quite di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the Gold Coa&s;t, till near 200 Years after the fir&s;t di&s;covery, namely, till the Year 1646; which as it is matter of Hi&s;tory after the Di&s;covery, does not &s;o much come within the compa&s;s of this De&s;ign.

<P>As he met with &s;uch wonderful Succe&s;s in the&s;e Parts, and the <HI>Portugueze</HI> &s;ettled with &s;o much Advantage, that the very Nation grew Rich, and as I have &s;aid, it was call'd the Golden Age; it may be rea&s;onably &s;uppos'd he was encourag'd to go on. And accordingly, being &s;upplyed with Ships and Men, he extended him&s;elf farther and farther to the <HI>South;</HI> and &s;till planting and forti|fying wherever he came; he in &s;hort gave the <HI>Portugueze</HI> a Name and a Footing at the Mouths of every River, and upon the Coa&s;ts of every King|dom,

<P>THIS Di&s;covery immediately made a great noi&s;e in the World, and the <HI>Portugueze</HI> who&s;e na|vigating Glory was now grown really very great fail'd not to continue to bring infinite Profits as well to the public as to the private Merchants con|cern'd; and this made them extend them&s;elves up|on all the Coa&s;ts, as above, in &s;uch a manner, that it was once &s;aid <HI>Portugal</HI> was going to remove into <HI>Guinea</HI> and <HI>Angola:</HI> But they did not end here, for &s;ome Years after they &s;tretch'd from the Cape of <HI>Good Hope</HI> along to the North-Ea&s;t, yet &s;till clo&s;e under Shore. Thus leaving the South|point of <HI>Africa,</HI> and following the Coa&s;t, they be|gan Settlements and Colonies on the Ea&s;t-Coa&s;t of the Main-land, as they had before done on the We&s;t; a Place never heard of before in the World.

<P>THE learned Author of <HI>Lexicon Technicum</HI> a&s;|&s;ures us that the knowledge of the Magnet is very antient, and he quotes it from <HI>Sturmius.</HI> By the knowledge of it he does not only &s;ay the know|ledge of the mere Stone or <HI>Fo&s;&s;il,</HI> which he thinks approaches to the Species of <HI>Iron Oar,</HI> but that its attractive Quality was known. But even this, which we are not a&s;&s;ured of, did not &s;eem to an|&s;wer the end for which the great Di&s;covery was made, if that e&s;pecial Application of it to the Ma|thematicks, and in particular to this Branch re|lating

to Navigation had not likewi&s;e been di&s;|cover'd.</P>
<P>NOR was this part the work of a &s;hort &s;pace of time. The Verticity or Inclination of it to the North was di&s;cover'd about the Year 1380, by our Countryman <HI>Roger Bacon,</HI> the &s;ame whom we call <HI>Fryer Bacon,</HI> who was a compleat Mathematician; the &s;ame which old Stories tells &s;o many fabled Tales about, which have &s;o little Truth to &s;upport them; yet 'tis certain this <HI>Bacon</HI> did &s;trange Things by the Magic of this powerful Attractive, and for that was &s;uppos'd to deal with the <HI>Devil.</HI></P>
<P>BUT even this could not lead us to the u&s;e of it in the great Article, which it has &s;ince been apply'd to, but it was re&s;erv'd for the honour of an <HI>Italian</HI> of <HI>Gaaeta,</HI> in the Kingdom of <HI>Naples;</HI> who finding its Virtue communicative to the Steel, and that all Steel would if touch'd, touch again what it impre&s;s'd: Upon this he fell to wor&s;hip the Di&s;covery, and to &s;pread it gradually into the World; and thus by little and little it came to be of public U&s;e, and the Di&s;coveries which have been made by it, and the Improvements upon it are innumerable; &s;ome of them may be &s;um'd up out of the Learned Mr. <HI>Boyl</HI> and others as follows.</P>
<P N="1">I. THAT in every <HI>Magnet</HI> there are two <HI>Poles,</HI> one pointing <HI>North,</HI> the other <HI>South;</HI> and if a <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> be cut or broken into ever &s;o many pieces, there are likewi&s;e two <HI>Poles</HI> in each piece.</P>
<P N="2">II. THAT the&s;e <HI>Poles</HI> in divers parts of the Globe are diver&s;ely inclined towards the Earth's center.</P>
<P N="3">III. THAT the&s;e <HI>Poles,</HI> tho' contrary to one another, do help mutually towards the <HI>Magnetic Attraction</HI> and to the Su&s;pen&s;ion of Iron.</P>
<P N="4"><PB N="252" REF="266">
IV. IF two <HI>Magnets</HI> are Spherical, one will turn or conform it&s;elf to the other, &s;o as either of them would do to the Earth; and that after they have &s;o conformed or turned them&s;elves, they endeavour to approach and to join each other, but if placed in a contrary Po&s;ition they avoid each other.</P>
<P N="5">V. IF a <HI>Magnet</HI> be cut through the Axis, the parts or Segments of the Stone, which before were joined, will now avoid and fly each other.</P>
<P N="6">VI. IF the <HI>Magnet</HI> be cut by a Section perpendi|cular to its Axis, the two points which before were conjoined will become contrary <HI>Poles,</HI> one in one the other in the other Segment.</P>
<P N="7">VII. IRON receives Virtue from the <HI>Magnet</HI> by Application to it, or barely from an approach near it, tho' it doth not touch it; and the Iron receives this Virtue variou&s;ly according to the parts of the Stone 'tis made to touch, or made approach to.</P>
<P N="8">VIII. IF an oblong piece of Iron be any how ap|plied to the Stone, it receives virtue from it on|ly, as to its length.</P>
<P N="9">IX. THE <HI>Magnet</HI> lo&s;es none of its own Virtue by communicating any to the Iron; and this Vir|tue it can communicate to Iron very &s;peedily, tho' the longer the Iron touches or joins the Stone, the longer will its communicated Virtue hold, and a better <HI>Magnet</HI> will communicate more of it, and &s;ooner than one not &s;o good.</P>
<P N="10"><PB N="253" REF="267">
X. THAT <HI>Steel</HI> receives Virtue from the <HI>Magnet</HI> better than <HI>Iron.</HI></P>
<P N="11">XI. A <HI>Needle</HI> touch'd by a <HI>Magnet</HI> will turn its ends the &s;ame way towards the <HI>Poles</HI> of the World, as the <HI>Magnet</HI> will do it.</P>
<P N="12">XII. THAT neither <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> or <HI>Needles</HI> touch'd do conform their <HI>Poles</HI> exactly to tho&s;e of the World, but have u&s;ually &s;ome variation from them; and this variation is different in divers places, and at divers times, in the &s;ame place.</P>
<P N="13">XIII. THAT a <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> will take up much more Iron when arm'd or cap'd than it can alone, and that tho' an Iron Ring or Key be &s;u&s;pended by the <HI>Load&s;tone,</HI> yet the magnetical Particles do not hinder that Ring or Key from turning round any way, either to the right Hand or to the left.</P>
<P N="14">XIV. THAT the force of a <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> may be va|riou&s;ly increa&s;ed or le&s;&s;ened by the various ap|plication of Iron or another <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> to it.</P>
<P N="15">XV. THAT a &s;trong <HI>Magnet</HI> at the lea&s;t di&s;tance from a le&s;&s;er or a weaker cannot draw to it a piece of Iron adhereing actually to &s;uch le&s;&s;er or weaker Stone, but if it come to touch it, it can draw it from the other; but a weaker <HI>Mag|net,</HI> or even a little piece of Iron can draw a|way or &s;eparate a piece of Iron contiguous to a greater or &s;tronger <HI>Load&s;tone.</HI></P>
<P N="16">XVI. THAT in our <HI>North</HI> parts of the World the <HI>South Pole</HI> of a <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> will rai&s;e up more Iron than the <HI>North Pole.</HI></P>

XVII. THAT a plate of Iron only (but no other Body interpo&s;ed) can impede the Operation of the <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> either; as to its attractive or di|rective Quality; Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> found this true in Gla&s;&s;es &s;ealed hermetically; and Gla&s;s is a Body as impervoius as mo&s;t are to all Effluvia.</P>
<P N="18">XVIII. THAT the Power or Virtue of a <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> may be impaired by lying long in a wrong po&s;|ture, as al&s;o by Ru&s;t, Wet, &amp;c. and may be quite de&s;troyed by Fire.</P>
<P N="19">XIX. MR. <HI>Boyle</HI> found that by heating a <HI>Magnet</HI> red hot, it would be &s;peedily deprived of its at|tractive Quality.</P>
<P N="20">XX. IF a <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> be heated red hot, and then cooled, either with its <HI>South Pole</HI> to the <HI>North</HI> in a horizontal Po&s;ition, or with its <HI>South Pole</HI> downwards in a perpendicular one, it will change its Polarity, the <HI>South Pole</HI> becoming the Northern one, and <HI>vice ver&s;a.</HI></P>
<P N="21">XXI. BY applying the <HI>Poles</HI> of a very &s;mall frag|ment of a <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> to the oppo&s;ite contiguous ones of a good large <HI>Magnet,</HI> Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> found he could &s;peedily change the <HI>Poles</HI> of the fragment, but he could not effect it in a fragment that was con&s;iderably bigger, tho' he tried many Hours.</P>
<P N="22">XXII. HE ob&s;erved that well tempered and hardened Iron Tools, when heated by Attrition, turning, fileing, &amp;c. would while warm at|tract thin Fileings or Chips of Iron and Steel, but not when cold; yet it has been &s;een and tried that a large piece of a File, which was in the Hands of Mr. <HI>Yarnwel</HI> the <HI>Spectacle|maker,</HI>
<PB N="255" REF="269">
did retain &s;uch an attractive Quality that it would take up and keep &s;u&s;pended the Key of a Cabinet or Scrutoire, and needed no Attrition to excite this magnetical Virtue.</P>
<P N="23">XXIII. THE Iron Bars of Windows, which have long &s;tood in an erect Pot&s;iion, do grow per|manently Magnetical. The lower ends of &s;uch Bars being the <HI>North Poles,</HI> and the upper the <HI>Southern;</HI> for according to the Laws of <HI>Mag|neti&s;m,</HI> we find the lower ends of &s;uch Bars will drive away the North end of a poi&s;ed <HI>Needle,</HI> Southerly; which &s;hew, that by the continual pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ubtile magnetical Particles through them, they are turned into a kind of <HI>Magnet</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P N="24">XXIV. IF a Bar of Iron that hath not &s;tood long in an erected po&s;ture, be only held perpendicu|larly, its lower end will be the <HI>North Pole,</HI> and attract the <HI>South Pole</HI> of a touch'd <HI>Needle;</HI> but then this Virtue is tran&s;ient, and will &s;hift as you invert the Bar; for the other end when held lowermo&s;t will pre&s;ently become the <HI>North Pole;</HI> wherefore in order to render the quality of Verticity permanent in an Iron Bar, it mu&s;t remain a long time in a proper Po&s;ition, but the Fire will produce this effect in a very &s;hort time; for as it will immediately deprive a <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> of its attractive Power, or change its <HI>Poles</HI> (as in Experiment XIX and XX) &s;o it will as &s;oon give a Verticity to a Bar of Iron, if, being heated red hot, it be cooled in an erect Po&s;ition, or di|rectly <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South;</HI> nay, it hath been ob|&s;erved often, that even Tongs and Fire-Forks, by being often heated, and then &s;et to cool in a Po&s;ition, near to erect, have gained this mag|netical Property; the Rea&s;on of which, very
<PB N="256" REF="270">
different Effects of the Fire on a <HI>Magnet,</HI> and on Iron, Mr. <HI>Boyle,</HI> with his u&s;ual Mode&s;ty, &s;ugge&s;ts to be this, that the peculiar Texture or Con&s;ti|tution, by which a <HI>Magnet</HI> differs from common Iron Ore, being accurate and fine, is &s;poiled by the rude and violent attacks of the Fire; but this mighty Agent by working upon Iron &s;oftens and opens the Pores of the Metal (which is harder than Iron Ore) &s;o that it becomes capable of being prevaded by the magnetical Particles, and by that means gain a vertical Quality.</P>
<P N="25">XXV. MR. <HI>Boyle</HI> found, that by heating a piece of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Oker red hot, and placeing it to cool in a proper Po&s;ture, it plainly gain'd a mag|netic Power.</P>
<P N="26">XXVI. THE &s;ame noble Gentleman found that an extellent <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> of his own, having lain almo&s;t a Year in an inconvenient Po&s;ture had its Virtue &s;o impaired, that he at fir&s;t thought &s;ome Body had got at it, and &s;poiled it by Fire.</P>
<P N="27">XXVII. IF a <HI>Needle</HI> be well touch'd on a good <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> 'tis known it will when duly poi&s;ed point <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South;</HI> but if it have one con|trary touch of the &s;ame Stone, it will immedi|ately be deprived of that Faculty, and by a|nother &s;uch touch, it will have its <HI>Poles</HI> quite changed; &s;o that the end which before pointed North &s;hall now point Southward.</P>
<P N="28">XXVIII. DR. <HI>Power</HI> and Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> both tryed, that after a red hot Iron had gain'd a Verticity by being well heated, and cooled <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South,</HI> and then al&s;o hammer'd at the ends, this Virtue would immediately be de&s;troyed by
<PB N="257" REF="271">
two or three blows of a &s;trong Hammer &s;martly given about the middle of it.</P>
<P N="29">XXIX. MR. <HI>Boyle</HI> found by drawing the back of a Knife, or long piece of Steel Wire, &amp;c. over the <HI>Poles</HI> of a <HI>Load&s;tone</HI> lei&s;urely, once or divers time, beginning the Motion from the middle or Equator of the Stone, towards the <HI>Pole,</HI> the Knife or Wire will accordingly attract one end of a poi&s;ed magnetical <HI>Needle;</HI> but if you take another Knife or Wire, and thru&s;t it lei&s;urely over the <HI>Pole,</HI> from the <HI>Pole</HI> towards the Equator or middle of the Equator, this Knife &s;hall drive or expel away the &s;ame end of the <HI>Needle</HI> which the former Knife would attract, which Experi|ment makes it very probable that the Operation of the <HI>Magnet</HI> depends upon the flux of &s;ome fine Particles, which go out at one <HI>Pole,</HI> then round about, and in again at the other.</P>
<P N="30">XXX. BECAUSE it is one of the univer&s;al Laws of Nature, that Action and Re-action are al|ways equal; therefore it is plain, the Iron mu&s;t attract the <HI>Magnet</HI> as much as that doth the Iron, and &s;o you may ea&s;ily experiment it to be in Fact if you place a <HI>Magnet</HI> or piece of Iron on a piece of Cork, &s;o as that it may &s;wim freely in the Water, for then you will &s;ee that which &s;o|ever you hold in your Hand will draw the other towards it. From all which Experiments 'tis plain (as Mr. <HI>Boyle</HI> concludes) that <HI>Magneti&s;m</HI> doth much depend upon mechanical Principles, as al&s;o that there is &s;uch a thing as the <HI>Mag|neti&s;m</HI> of the Earth, or that there are magneti|cal Particles which continually are pa&s;&s;ing from <HI>Pole</HI> to <HI>Pole;</HI> but Sir <HI>I&s;aac Newton</HI> demon&s;trates that Gravity is a very different thing from <HI>Mag|neti&s;m,</HI> &s;ince the former is always as the quanti|ty

of Matter attracted, but <HI>Magneti&s;m</HI> by no means &s;o.</P>
<P><HI>SEBASTIAN Cabot,</HI> the famous and fir&s;t di&s;coverer of <HI>America,</HI> is &s;aid to have found out the Variation of the <HI>Magneti&s;m</HI> in different Po&s;iti|ons; others have improv'd &s;ince upon the Varia|tion, and form'd &s;everal Experiments upon that Arch which they call the <HI>Azimuth</HI> or magnetical <HI>Azimuth;</HI> which is an Arch of the Horizon con|tain'd between the Sun's <HI>Azimuth Circle</HI> and the <HI>magnetical Meridian;</HI> or to put it into as intelligible Terms as I can, the di&s;tance of the Sun in any particular place from the North or South Pole, and this is found by an Ob&s;ervation; for which they have now a particular In&s;trument call'd an <HI>Azimuth Compa&s;s,</HI> the de&s;cription of which is not to the pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>UPON this Magnetic Tendency to the Poles, which being communicated to the Iron or Steel, gave the Iron or Steel the &s;ame Tendency, have been form'd all the &s;ub&s;equent Improvements of Art u&s;eful in Navigation and in Geography. By this the Globe has been regularly mea&s;ur'd, the imaginary Arch of the Heavens, and the Po&s;ition and Motion of Things regularly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>BY this the Compa&s;s was form'd, and &s;everal Points before divided more exactly a&s;certained, and the Analogy form'd between &s;pace and time, the Degrees and Miles in &s;pace being made to an&s;wer exactly to the Hours and Minutes in the mea&s;ure of Time.</P>

<P>NOW the adventurous Mariner confin'd him&s;elf no more to the meanne&s;s of coa&s;ting along the Shores, &s;tanding in need of the &s;ight of Land, or of the heavenly Bodies to guide him&s;elf in again, when he was gotten at a great di&s;tance from the Land, the Needle &s;howing him his way, as I may &s;ay, without Eyes; for the Steel pointing always duely to the North or to the South, and thereby &s;howing any other Point, the Mariner immediate|found him&s;elf at home every where, and in the darke&s;t Night, or the thicke&s;t Fog, when neither Sun, Moon, Stars, Land-mark, or Sea-mark, was to be &s;een, yet they knew exactly both where, and which way they were going.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY like young Swimmers grown expert, and who &s;corn any longer to keep within their depth, and in &s;hallow Waters, but boldly &s;wim off into the Chanels of the large&s;t Rivers; &s;o here the Mariners &s;corning any longer to coa&s;t along the Shores as before, boldly travets'd the open Seas with regard to the di&s;tances they were in from the Land, &s;o that the wide&s;t Seas could not confine their &s;earch, or the remote&s;t Climate be conceal'd from their Di&s;covery.

in Ve&s;&s;els of a thou&s;and Ton Burthen, and after|wards of much more.</P>
<P>As they built Ships like Ca&s;tles, &s;o Guns being al&s;o brought into u&s;e, they brought their Ships to bear great Guns like as Ca&s;tles did, and &s;everal great pieces of Ordinance were mounted upon the&s;e Carvels in &s;uch a manner, that they were able to maintain terrible Fights at Sea, and to an&s;wer Bat|teries upon the Shore in their own kind; nay &s;ome|times to over-power the Batteries on Shore, and to enter Harbours and Ports by force, tho' defend|ed by &s;trong Fortifications, and man'd by &s;trong Garri&s;ons.</P>
<P>THIS made the Marine Nations grow power|ful by Sea, as well as by Land, and in a few Years the <HI>Portugne&s;e</HI> and <HI>Spaniards</HI> fitted out large Fleets, carrying great &s;trength, of Guns, and their Shipping was able to make them terrible wherever they came.</P>
<P>IT was very remarkable then, and it is even &s;till worth ob&s;erving, in how &s;hort an interval of Time the World came up to this height of Im|provement, from the gro&s;s Ignorance which they were in before. It was but in 1498, that the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e,</HI> ignorant of the Compa&s;s, and not daring to venture out to Sea, di&s;cover'd the Cape of <HI>Good-Hope,</HI> and dur&s;t go no farther; and within le&s;s than twenty Years more we find them planted upon the <HI>Bra&s;ils</HI> in <HI>America,</HI> and Ma&s;ters of every Coa&s;t in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> even up to the <HI>Spice I&s;lands,</HI> and almo&s;t to <HI>China</HI> it&s;elf, their Ships carrying va&s;t Burthens, heavy Pieces of Ordnance, and &s;triking a Terror into all the Countries where ever they came.</P>
<P>SO &s;wift was the Improvement of the Times, when once they got a ta&s;t of Knowledge, and &s;o ea&s;ily did they let them&s;elves into the mo&s;t u&s;eful part of the Di&s;covery as &s;oon as it was made; nor

it long before the re&s;t of the Nations follow'd them at the Heels; and that &s;o &s;oon as in a few Years to over-power them, and indeed in time to &s;upplant them in &s;ome of the mo&s;t valuable Set|tlements and Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions they bad, e&s;pecially in the <HI>Ea&s;t Indies,</HI> and on the <HI>Gold Coa&s;t of Guinea.</HI></P>
<P>BUT that which is the mo&s;t &s;urprizing in this driving the <HI>Portugu&s;e</HI> out of their foreign Planta|tions and Factories, is this; that the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> lo&s;t not only their Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the <HI>Dutch</HI> taking from them all their Forts and Factories, Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and E&s;tates, e&s;pecially in the <HI>Ea&s;t-Indies,</HI> but they lo&s;t their navigating Genius, and their Fame as Sea|men, and from being e&s;teem'd (as in the fifteenth Contury they were) the be&s;t Seamen in the World, they are now &s;unk down in their Reputati|on to the very wor&s;t; &s;o that nothing on this &s;ide the <HI>Mediterranean</HI> is look'd upon with more con|tempt, or treated with more di&s;dain in tho&s;e Things than a <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Seaman, whether we &s;peak of the ordinary Mariners or the Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>IT is true they did act vigorou&s;ly in one Ca&s;e; and indeed if they had not they would by this time have had little or nothing left of all their foreign Acqui&s;itions worth then keeping; and this was in recovering their great Colony of the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> which the <HI>Dutch</HI> once had taken entirely from them, and kept the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of for &s;everal Years. But when the Dake of <HI>Braganza</HI> a&s;&s;um'd the Crown of <HI>Portugal,</HI> taking up Arms again&s;t the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Duke <HI>S$bom|berg,</HI> recover'd and &s;ettled the Crown in the &s;aid Hou&s;e of <HI>Braganza;</HI> as the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> vigorou&s;ly recover'd their Liberty from the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Yoke in <HI>Europe,</HI> &s;o they took Arms too in the <HI>Bra&s;ils</HI> a|gain&s;t the <HI>Dutch;</HI> and after a faint Re&s;i&s;tance only $Span$ were oblig'd to quit the whole Country to them, and they retain the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it to

<HEAD>CHAP. XX. <HI>Of the &s;everal Di&s;coveries of the I&s;lands and Continent of</HI> America. <HI>The early product of the knowledge of the Needle, and its U&s;es in Navigation. Al&s;o of the Northern Naviga|tors in que&s;t of the North-Ea&s;t and North-We&s;t Pa&s;&s;ages to</HI> China; <HI>and whether it is probable &s;uch Pa&s;&s;ages ever will be di&s;co|vered.</HI></HEAD>
<P>AS the knowledge of the Needle, and its being apply'd to &s;uch mighty Purpo&s;es in Naviga|tion, came forward in the World with the begin|ning of the &s;ixteenth Century, it was wonderful even to a&s;toni&s;hing, to reflect how &s;wift its Pro|gre&s;s was.</P>
<P><HI>CRISTOPHER Columbus</HI> &s;etting out from the <HI>Canary I&s;lands,</HI> as if he was a&s;&s;ur'd there was a new We&s;tern World to be found out, tho' he nei|ther knew or had heard of any &s;uch thing, &s;ail'd directly We&s;t, not knowing whither he went, and re&s;olv'd to go on till he found &s;omething.</P>
<P>IN this Voyage he &s;ail'd long enough to di&s;|courage any Man in the World, and to put it out of que&s;tion to him, that if he found nothing he and all his Men mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h and eat one another, for he could never hope to &s;ub&s;i&s;t him&s;elf in going back again. In a Word he &s;ail'd 987 Leagues by his reckoning, from the <HI>Pico Te|neriffa,</HI> all the way due We&s;t, and never &s;aw any thing but Land and Sea; enough as, I &s;ay, to di&s;|courage
<PB N="265" REF="279">
any Man alive, when happily, and to the inexpre&s;&s;ible Joy of him and all his Men, on St. <HI>Luke's-Day Anno</HI> 1586, they di&s;cover'd Land, which proved to be the <HI>Bahama</HI> I&s;lands, by him for that Rea&s;on, call'd St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s, and &s;ince that the <HI>Lucaya</HI> I&s;lands.</P>
<P>FROM hence he went North-We&s;t and di&s;co|ver'd the Coa&s;t of <HI>Florida;</HI> but finding it a barren Country, he turn'd South, and landed upon the I&s;lands of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;paniola;</HI> after which, mak|ing farther and more ample Di&s;coveries, he re|turn'd to <HI>Spain</HI> to give the King of <HI>Spain</HI> an account of what he had &s;een and done.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd this was putting their im|prov'd Knowledge, <HI>young as it was,</HI> upon the Ten|ters; and I may &s;ay, &s;tretching it to the ut|mo&s;t, the va&s;t extent of Waters which they were upon, and which they yet knew not the end of, was frightful; and <HI>Columbus</HI> him&s;elf, tho' &s;ome &s;ay he had &s;een &s;ome of the Southward of the <HI>Caribbee</HI> I&s;lands, where the run was &s;horter, <HI>(viz.)</HI> from <HI>Cape de Verd</HI> by above 1000 Miles, began to give him&s;elf over for lo&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT this encourag'd them, and indeed is the &s;olid comfort of the Sailors Knowledge, by virtue of the never failing unerring Tendency of the Needle always pointing to its Pole; I &s;ay this was their dependance, and this encourag'd them, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that they knew they did not wander, they knew they did not drive this way and that, as the Winds or Currents wou'd have carry'd them, but that which way &s;oever the Winds blew, or the Currents &s;et, they &s;till kept true to their Point, and went &s;trait on; &s;o that they every Day, nay every Hour went farther and farther due We&s;t, and were able (whenever they thought fit to give over the pur&s;uit of their de&s;ign) to have turn'd directly back again, and if their Provi&s;ions would hold them, to
<PB N="266" REF="280">
have come home to the <HI>Canaries</HI> from whence they &s;et out.</P>
<P>IT is true they were unhappily longer than they need to have been upon this Voyage; that is to &s;ay, they had a longer run before they di&s;cover'd Land, becau&s;e they kept &s;o much to the North|ward of the Line; namely, in the Latitude of twenty three to twenty four Degrees; whereas if they had &s;teer'd two Points more to the Southward all the way, they wou'd have made Land at &s;ome of the Ea&s;tmo&s;t I&s;lands, either at <HI>Hi&s;paniola</HI> or <HI>Porto Rico,</HI> or &s;ome of tho&s;e Places in the Latitude of twenty Degrees, or thereabouts; but this mi&s;|take they &s;oon learn'd to rectify: With this en|crea&s;e of Mathematical Knowledge came many other u&s;eful Di&s;coveries, as well as tho&s;e of Navi|gation, &s;uch as relate to the Shipwrights Art, and other Mechanick Trades.</P>
<P>FIRST of all the learned Men, as if all Na|ture was newly laid open to them, made daily more and more Di&s;coveries in the Principles of Things; Mines and Minerals were al&s;o infi|nitely encreas'd; the People more boldly ven|tur'd into the Bowels of the Earth than before, and the Miners dug in the Earth as the Sailors work'd upon the Waters by the Compa&s;s. Infi|nite Experiments were made by the <HI>Boyls</HI> and <HI>Newtons</HI> of that Age; for all modern Knowledge &s;eems to have builded upon their fir&s;t Experiments and to &s;tand upon their Shoulders; Chymi&s;try, Alchimy, Refining, Separating, Purging, Subli|mating, and even to that yet unknown, tho' not un&s;ought Mi&s;tery, call'd Tran&s;mutation, all had their ri&s;e and invention in the&s;e Ages, and much of it from the&s;e beginnings.</P>
<P>PHYSIC felt the advantage, and daily Ex|periments added to the Knowledge of the Learned, as the Di&s;covery of new Countries encreas'd the
<PB N="267" REF="281">
Pharmacy of tho&s;e Times, and added noble Simples and innumerable invaluable Particulars to the <HI>Materia Medica</HI> of the Phy&s;ician. The <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Mi&s;&s;ionaries &s;ent over by the Church, that is to &s;ay by the Congregation <HI>De propaganda fide,</HI> were many of them Men of Learning; &s;ome of them, e&s;pecially the Je&s;uits, had &s;tudied Phy&s;ic, and were really good Phy&s;icians, others &s;tudied Nature, and were curious in &s;earching af|ter Drugs, Plants, Gums, and other Simples, and others after Minerals and Metals; &s;o that Nature was merely ravag'd, as I may &s;ay, wherever they came.</P>
<P>BY the&s;e tho&s;e glorious medicinal Drugs, &s;trange exotic Plants, and Animals, with &s;everal other valuable Things were di&s;cover'd, which the World heard nothing of before; &s;uch as the <HI>Peruvian Bark</HI> that &s;overeign and &s;pecific Medicine in all inter|mitting and periodical Fevers, and even in that Witchcraft (or Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, I know not what to call it) which we name an Ague: The <HI>Cantharides,</HI> or as vulgarly call'd <HI>Spani&s;h-Flyes,</HI> of wonderful and various Operation in Phy&s;ic; the <HI>Lapis Contrayerva</HI> equal, nay &s;uperior to the famous <HI>Ga&s;coign Powder;</HI> the <HI>Indian Root</HI> or the <HI>Hypecocuana,</HI> e&s;teem'd the be&s;t Emetick in the World; <HI>Bal&s;am</HI> or <HI>Balm</HI> of <HI>Peru,</HI> more valuable than that of <HI>Gilead</HI> or of <HI>Mecca;</HI> the <HI>Snake Root;</HI> the <HI>Tamarinds</HI> or <HI>Guinea Grains,</HI> the <HI>Civet</HI> of <HI>Africa,</HI> and many others, too many to enumerate.</P>
<P>LIKEWISE of Drugs for Dying, or as we or|dinarily call them <HI>Dye-Stuffs;</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Logwood, Fu&s;tic, Nicaragua Wood, Bra&s;iletto, Shumack, Indi|co,</HI> and <HI>Cochineal,</HI> the la&s;t the inimitable Drug for fixing the brighte&s;t Scarlets, Crim&s;ons, and Purples; and which was never heard of before; and to crown all, the <HI>Cocoa</HI> of which we now make Chocolate, the <HI>Sugar Cane</HI> and <HI>Piemento,</HI> the

<HI>Coffee</HI> of the <HI>Red Sea</HI> and the <HI>Tea</HI> of <HI>China,</HI> with the Lack or Lacquer of <HI>Japan</HI> and <HI>China,</HI> and the Earthen Ware, or <HI>China</HI> Ware, al&s;o of the &s;ame; not forgetting the Furs or <HI>Peltry</HI> of <HI>North America;</HI> and to clo&s;e all, the <HI>Tobacco,</HI> a Plant never heard of in the World till the di&s;covery of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P>THERE are indeed no Metals that were found out in any of the Parts thus di&s;cover'd, which were not known in <HI>Europe,</HI> except a kind of mixture of Tin and Lead, which we call <HI>Teutenague,</HI> of which the <HI>Chine&s;es</HI> make their Cani&s;ters for Tea, and with which they line their other Ve&s;&s;els of Copper or Iron, Earth or Wood, and is very good for keep|ing &s;uch things in, as are nice in Smell, and apt to be ting'd with the ta&s;t of the Metal or Wood which the Ve&s;&s;el was made of; like as we tin over our Copper Saucepans and Boylers, and all our white Iron or Latin, of which we make &s;mall Ve&s;|&s;els for Kitchen Service; but I &s;ay, as to Metals we found none new; neither Jewels, for as to Em|ralds, Pearl, Diamonds, and Rubies, all tho&s;e the World had &s;een before.</P>
<P>IT would require an Index of Curio&s;ities and Rarities in Nature &s;hould I go about to de&s;cribe all the Particulars which the di&s;covery of the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> and <HI>We&s;t Indies</HI> furni&s;h'd us with; which are now become as familiar to us as if they belong'd to and were the product of our own Soil: Some of them are us'd in Phy&s;ick, others in Food, &s;ome in Arts, as Dying, Painting, and Laquering; &s;ome in Manufacturing, &s;ome in Ornaments, and all in Trade; I &s;ay it requires an Index of Rarities too long for this Work; but many of them will come of cour&s;e to be &s;poken of hereafter.</P>
<P>IN the mean time it ought to be mention'd here, that not only Navigation fortify'd by the addition of the Mathematicks arriv'd now to daily Im|provement, and Di&s;covery, and animated the
<PB N="269" REF="283">
People of the&s;e parts of the World to an extraordi|nary &s;earch after new Worlds, &s;ailing in new Seas, and pur&s;uing new Adventures; but according to my Title I ought in &s;ome mea&s;ure to enter upon the Hi&s;tory of tho&s;e new Di&s;coveries, and give at lea&s;t an hi&s;torical Account of the Di&s;coveries them|&s;elves, and the time of them; that &s;o we may at once take a view of the foreign Plantations, Colo|nies, and Factories, which the &s;everal trading Na|tions of <HI>Europe</HI> are at this time po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of in <HI>America, Africa,</HI> and <HI>India,</HI> and of the encrea&s;e of their Improvements in tho&s;e Countries.</P>
<P>IN doing this I &s;hall come of cour&s;e to the ma|terial part, and which indeed is the chief de&s;ign of, and the end of this whole Undertaking; name|ly to &s;eek after &s;uch farther Di&s;coveries as are &s;till behind.</P>
<P>ALL prai&s;e worthy Knowledge &s;eems to have a Tendency to &s;ome thing farther to be known. The great encrea&s;e of local Di&s;covery invites us &s;till to &s;omething beyond it&s;elf, which is &s;till le&s;s to be di&s;cover'd. Neither <HI>Africa</HI> or <HI>America</HI> are yet fully di&s;cover'd: There are yet infinite Trea|&s;ures of Trade and Plantation, to be &s;earch'd after, innumerable Nations not convers'd with, navi|gable Rivers not &s;ail'd up into, unknown Lands not travers'd, and unknown Seas not navigated.</P>
<P>THE Center of <HI>Africa,</HI> the Extremes of <HI>America,</HI> the Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI> the Ri|vers of <HI>Amazones</HI> and <HI>Oroonoque,</HI> and all the va&s;t Country between them are to this Day unconquer'd by the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and unenquir'd into by any other Nations. The&s;e two Rivers are navigable at lea&s;t a thou&s;and five hundred Miles, if not two thou&s;and Miles each; they receive innumerable other Rivers which are likewi&s;e navigable many Miles, perhaps hundreds from the North to the South in their way; there

Let us then enquire a little after what is known, and after what is &s;till to know, and &s;ee (if we can) how much more, infinitely more the latter is than the former, that we may whet the In|du&s;try of future Ages, and tell our Po&s;terity a little of what is before them.</P>

<P>I HAVE ob&s;erv'd already all the Coa&s;t of <HI>Afri|ca</HI> from Cape <HI>Spartel,</HI> at the Mouth of the <HI>Me|diterranean Sea,</HI> being in the Latitude of thirty two to thirty three Degrees North, and being the North-We&s;t Point of <HI>Africa,</HI> to <HI>Cape de Bona E&s;peranza,</HI> in the Latitude of thirty four Degrees and half South; being the farthe&s;t point of the Land of <HI>Afri|ca,</HI> South; al&s;o about again to the Ea&s;t Shore of <HI>A|frica,</HI> and along the Coa&s;ts of <HI>Mozambique</HI> and <HI>Zan|guebar</HI> to the Latitude of &s;even to eight Degrees North; <HI>I &s;ay,</HI> the&s;e were all di&s;cover'd and planted by tho&s;e three famous Navigators for the King of <HI>Portugal, Anthony Nola a Genoe&s;e, Bartholomew Diaz,</HI> and <HI>Va&s;co de Gama, Portugue&s;e,</HI> and all before the
<PB N="271" REF="285">
beginning of the &s;ixteenth Century, and before the finding out the knowledge of the Magnet, or at lea&s;t before the u&s;e of the Needle in the Compa&s;s; which I mention, becau&s;e for that Rea&s;on I have nothing to do with it in this Chapter.</P>
<P>HITHERTO the be&s;t Navigators were mere Coa&s;ters; they never willingly lo&s;t &s;ight of Land, nor ever thought them&s;elves ea&s;y if they did. If Storms began to threaten, the Winds ruffle them, and the Seas run high, they were &s;ure to make in for the fir&s;t Port they could reach, or to come to an Anchor under the fir&s;t Weather-Shore they could make; nor did the timerous Sailors fail up|on many occa&s;ions of &s;uch Hazards, which we now call trifling, to run on Shore for &s;afety, haling their Ships into &s;uch Creeks and Coves as they could get them into.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, in our Ages, the Seamen act upon quite other Notions. When it blows hard, and (as the Seamen call it) a <HI>Fret of Wind,</HI> the bold Mariner, having a good Ship under him, &s;huns the Shore as the only Terror, and as the principal place where his Danger lyes; he de&s;ires nothing more than <HI>Sea-room,</HI> good Ground Tackle, and a tight Ship; the fir&s;t to pre&s;erve him from Shoals and Rocks, and the next to ride out a Storm, when in Port; I &s;hou'd have added indeed the la&s;t, namely, that this is always &s;uppo&s;e him to have a tight Ship under him; for that is indeed a Seaman's main Dependance.</P>
<P>NOW, no &s;ooner was the knowledge of the Needle di&s;cover'd, and the Seaman had obtain'd this infallible Guide, by which he could always tell by Candlelight as well as Daylight, within Board as well as without, and as well without the help of Sun, Moon, and Stars, as with them, which way they were going, and which way they ought to go; I &s;ay, no &s;ooner was this obtain'd, but the
<PB N="272" REF="286">
fear of launching out, was all over; the Bu&s;ine&s;s was done; narrow Seas or broad Seas, Gulphs or Straights, Bays or Oceans, were now the &s;ame thing to the Mariner; he had no more to do but to inform him&s;elf rightly of the &s;ituation of every place to which he was bound, or where he found occa&s;ion to put in, and look upon the Globe or Plane of Surface, for the Latitude and meridi|an Di&s;tance, and he knew the way to it di|rectly.</P>
<Q><P><HI>O'er all the liquid Mountains of the Sea.</HI></P></Q>
<P>HENCE Geography fell to work to draw Charts and Maps of the Coa&s;ts, and to place every thing in its right Po&s;ition upon the plane of the Globe; that every Port, River, and Harbour, be|ing plac'd in its true Latitude, the truly skillful Seaman might be able by the Rules of this Art to know as well where it was, as which way to go to it, and how to find it.</P>
<P>IN con&s;equence of this Art, the long conceal'd World began to &s;how it&s;elf, and be found out; no|thing could ea&s;ily e&s;cape the indefatigable &s;earch of the diligent Seamen. As the Great thir&s;ted af|ter Conque&s;t, and the Merchant thir&s;ted after Gain, &s;o the skillful Mariner and expert Arti&s;t thir&s;ted after new di&s;cover'd Countries.</P>
<P>NO Country was without them; <HI>Spain</HI> had its <HI>Columbus, Jaquez Vela&s;co, Ferdinand Cortez,</HI> and its <HI>Francis Pizarro; Portugal</HI> had its <HI>Nola, Gama,</HI> and <HI>Diaz; France,</HI> tho' they made the meane&s;t Di&s;coveries, had their <HI>Sala, La Hontan, La Barre,</HI> and <HI>Hennepin;</HI> the <HI>Dutch</HI> had <HI>Heemskirk, Barents,</HI> and <HI>La Maire;</HI> and <HI>England,</HI> tho' they came in late, had their <HI>Drake, Raleigh,</HI> and <HI>Frobi&s;her; Davis, Hud&s;on, Willoughby, Smith, Sommers,</HI> and many &s;uch; by who&s;e Vigor and Application, <HI>England,</HI>

the mo&s;t daring Attempts that the World ever heard of; namely, to march directly to the Impe|rial City of <HI>Mexico,</HI> and attack the great <HI>Montezu|ma,</HI> the mightie&s;t Emperor of <HI>America,</HI> in the mid&s;t of his Armies, and in a City &s;aid to contain two Millions of People.</P>
<P>IN a Word, he march'd, enter'd the City, was driven out of it again, recruited his Army to the number of five hundred Foot and eighty Hor&s;e, return'd, be&s;ieg'd the City, took it, kill'd 120000 People in the Storm, &s;lew the Emperor, over|threw the Empire, de&s;troy'd the City, re-built it, made it the Seat of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Empire in <HI>America,</HI> and &s;o it continues to be to this Day.</P>
<P>THIS handful of Men, then extending every way, carry'd on the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Conque&s;ts for above two thou&s;and Leagues, even from the Latitude of forty Degrees North, to fifty three Degrees South, to the Mouth of the Straights of <HI>Magellan,</HI> &s;ubdu|ing infinite Nations of People, another Empire, <HI>viz.</HI> that of <HI>Peru.</HI> And proce&s;s of the&s;e Con|que&s;ts they now <HI>po&s;&s;e&s;s Florida, Guadalajara, New</HI> and <HI>Old Mexico, Guaxaca, Nicaragua, Guatimala, Tucatan, Honduras, Darien, Cartagena, St. Martha, New Granada, Venezula, Caracas, New Andalu&s;ia, Peru, Chili, Cu&s;co,</HI> and all the Countries upon the <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI> down to the Ea&s;t-&s;ide of the Straights of <HI>Magellan.</HI></P>

<P N="1">I.

<P>ON the We&s;t-&s;ide, which we call the Kingdoms of <HI>Chili</HI> and <HI>Peru,</HI> the Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI> which run parallel with the Sea for three thou&s;|and Miles, are the confe&s;s'd Limits of the <HI>Spa|ni&s;h</HI> Dominions; and on that Side we do not find the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Bounds reach any where one hundred Miles from the Sea, till they come the length of <HI>Lima,</HI> where it opens a little to the Ea&s;t, to the Cities of <HI>Cu&s;co</HI> and <HI>Plata,</HI> and the Mountains of <HI>Poto&s;i,</HI> and then &s;tretches away North again to the Country of <HI>Popayan.</HI></P>

<PB N="277" REF="291">
Bold and Daring, but &s;o infinitely Numerous, that it wou'd be a kind of De&s;peration to at|tempt them, unle&s;s it were with powerful Ar|mies regularly &s;upplyed and duly &s;upported to carry on a general Conque&s;t.</P>
<P>IT is evident the&s;e People are not Tame and Pa&s;&s;ive, as the <HI>Spaniards</HI> found the Inhabitants of <HI>Cuba</HI> and <HI>Hi&s;paniola,</HI> or tho&s;e of the <HI>Honduras</HI> and <HI>Guatimala;</HI> but Brave and Daring, not terrifyed with the noi&s;e of a Gun, or the glittering of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> Swords and Armour; but tho' they have no Guns, they boldly run up to the Teeth of the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and wounding them with poi&s;oned Laun|ces, fly from one to another with a &s;trange kind of Courage, next to De&s;peration; depending upon this, that if they can but wound a <HI>Spaniard,</HI> &s;o as to make him bleed, they know he is a dead Man, and &s;o fly to another.</P>
<P>BUT not to dwell upon their manner of Fight|ing, this is the Con&s;equence which reaches to the pre&s;ent Ca&s;e, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the <HI>Spaniards</HI> contenting them&s;elves with the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Cartagena,</HI> and other Ports and Places on the Sea-Coa&s;t, to &s;ecure their Commerce and Communication with <HI>Europe,</HI> they &s;tudy as much as po&s;&s;ible to live in Peace and good Neighbourhood with the &s;everal <HI>Indian</HI> Nati|ons behind them, who they know to be populous without Number, and therefore maintain their up|land or inland Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions and Settlements, chiefly as a Barrier again&s;t them, and to carry on a gain|ful Commerce with them.</P>
<P>As this is the Ca&s;e upon the whole Coa&s;t, it de|mon&s;trates what I &s;ay above, that the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> are but trifling, compar'd to the main Continent; and &s;uppo&s;e it were two hundred Miles, which we do not find it reaches any where, except about that part call'd <HI>New-Granada</HI> and

<HI>Popayan,</HI> and where it may be &s;aid to joyn with <HI>Peru;</HI> yet what is this to the va&s;t extended Coun|try behind it, to the River <HI>Oroonoque,</HI> and from thence to the <HI>Orelliana</HI> or <HI>Rio d' Amazones;</HI> and thence again to the <HI>Rio Parana, Paraguay,</HI> and <HI>La Plata?</HI> a Country of very near two thou&s;and Miles &s;quare, full of Wealth, and full of Millions of People, fruitful, and to a Miracle cultivated, the Savage Inhabitants con&s;ider'd; and in all which, it may be &s;aid, that never <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;et a Foot there, except <HI>a few Prie&s;ts;</HI> and tho&s;e at a Price too dear to encourage any to venture to follow, for mo&s;t of them were ma&s;&s;acred by the Na|tives.</P>
<P N="2">II. WE are to take Notice of the Plantation of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> on the Ea&s;t, or rather North-Ea&s;t part of <HI>South-America,</HI> which we call the <HI>Bra&s;ils.</HI> The <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> according to their ga&s;conading way of Writing, talk mighty big of this Colony; and it is indeed a very great Plantation, as I &s;hall take notice of by it&s;elf; and I mu&s;t add, that had any Nation but the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> been Ma&s;ters of it, the Improvement of it had been infinitely greater than it is. But take it in the utmo&s;t ex|tent which the vain boa&s;ting <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> can pre|tend to; namely, from the Mouth of the <HI>Orelliana,</HI> or River of <HI>Amazones,</HI> to the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> which is thirty five Degrees in Latitude, and which is 2100 Miles; yet what is it but a Verge of the Country, compar'd to the va&s;t Continent behind them? The Chri&s;tians (if the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> may be call'd &s;o) indeed are fully po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the Sea-Coa&s;t: But how far do they extend them&s;elves within the Country? From the Mouth of the River <HI>Amazones</HI> to <HI>Pernambuco,</HI> which is near five hun|dred Miles, and is call'd the <HI>North-Bra&s;il,</HI> they are no where Ma&s;ters of the Country fifty Miles from the Coa&s;t; nor have they any Cities or for|tify'd
<PB N="279" REF="293">
Places farther into the Country. If they corre&s;pond with the Natives higher up, it is by Compacts and mutual Agreements, and the Civi|lities of Neighbourhood and Commerce; but the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> are very numerous and powerful, and e&s;pecially having now learn'd the u&s;e of Fire-Arms, and obtain'd the Tru&s;t of them too from the <HI>Portugue&s;e;</HI> which by the way was none of the be&s;t pieces of Policy on their Side.</P>
<P>THESE <HI>Bra&s;ilians,</HI> I &s;ay, (who are very nu|merous) live at large in their own Towns and Vil|lages, clo&s;e at the Heels of the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> Settle|ments; where in &s;pight of all the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> can do, they enjoy their own Government, &s;uch as it is; live their own Way, do their own Bu&s;ine&s;s, re|&s;erve to them&s;elves their own &s;avage Cu&s;toms and Manners, and which they are very Tenacious of; and more than all retain their own Idolatry, and the Barbari&s;ins of their own Heathen Rites (I can|not call it Religion.) This I in&s;tance to prove, as it effectually does, that the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have little or no influence upon them, and con&s;equently are very far from any Government or Dominion be|yond the Bounds which they antiently po&s;&s;e&s;s'd; and which indeed is no more than a narrow Verge of the Country, as I have &s;aid, even all the way from the <HI>Equinoctial Line;</HI> (for the <HI>Rio d'Amazones</HI> enters the Ocean ju&s;t under the Equator) to the Latitude of thirty five Degrees South. The far|the&s;t place where the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have enter'd into the Land, is &s;aid to be at St. <HI>Salvador,</HI> where they tell us, their Gold Mines, newly di&s;cover'd, are three hundred Miles up the Country.</P>
<P>AND tho' this is begging the Que&s;tion for one particular Spot, and I do not grant it to be &s;o far by above one hundred Miles; yet even this, for one place does not alter the Ca&s;e; for &s;o the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> may be &s;aid to po&s;&s;e&s;s all the Country upon

the <HI>Rio de la Plata</HI> to <HI>Peru,</HI> becau&s;e they have of late made a kind of &s;ettled Commerce by the Na|vigation of that great River, between the Country of <HI>Peru</HI> and the <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> in the Mouth of the River.</P>
<P>BUT even this al&s;o is carryed on by a civil U&s;age of the Natives, of whom &s;everal Nations in|habit that great Country, tho' nothing &s;o Populous neither, as farther to the North; and this Navi|gation the <HI>Spaniards</HI> make profitable to tho&s;e Na|tives, otherwi&s;e they could never pre&s;erve it; but I &s;ay they make it profitable to them, by buying Provi&s;ions of them, and giving them <HI>European</HI> Goods for them; &s;uch as Knives, Hatchets, Sci&s;&s;ars, Beads, and other Toys, &s;uch as they like; as al&s;o Cloths, Callico, Linnen, and other Nece&s;&s;aries; but as to Conque&s;ts and Dominion, even the <HI>Spaniards</HI> them&s;elves do not pretend to it here. Nor do the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> in the <HI>Bra&s;ils</HI> attempt to exerci&s;e any Authority over the <HI>Bra&s;ilians;</HI> as particularly ap|pears in this, that they employ none of them as Servants; nor will the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> be their Ser|vants; nay, they will hardly a&s;&s;i&s;t them in any laborious Work, tho' paid for it.</P>
<P>MUCH le&s;s do the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> make any of them Slaves; but on the contrary they bring all their Slaves from <HI>Africa;</HI> and all their Drudgery is done by tho&s;e <HI>Negroes,</HI> the <HI>Bra&s;ilians</HI> being free, and &s;corning to labour for any one but them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>I NEED only refer for the Truth of this to <HI>Neuhoff</HI>'s Account of <HI>Bra&s;il,</HI> and to even the <HI>Por|tugue&s;e</HI> them&s;elves.</P>
<P>THUS it is evident all the center of this va&s;t Continent of <HI>South-America,</HI> for near four thou&s;|and Miles in length, and for two thou&s;and Miles in breath, in &s;ome Places more, is yet entirely un|di&s;cover'd, and not in the lea&s;t &s;ubdued; and tho'

<PB N="282" REF="296">
there was in all that part of <HI>America</HI> which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> &s;ubdued, and in which, according to <HI>Los Ca&s;as,</HI> the <HI>Spaniards</HI> put forty Millions to Death, be&s;ides tho&s;e that e&s;cap'd their Fury by flight, or were otherwi&s;e &s;o fortunate to e&s;cape them by Favour.</P>
<P>IN a Word, we have Rea&s;on to believe that there is no Chri&s;tian Nation in <HI>Europe,</HI> where the like Numbers of People are to be found in a nar|rower compa&s;s than on the Banks of the <HI>Rio d'A|mazones,</HI> or of the <HI>Oroonoque,</HI> except ju&s;t the Uni|ted <HI>Dutch</HI> and <HI>Flemi&s;h</HI> Provinces; where the par|ticular advantages of Commerce have drawn &s;uch Numbers of People together</P>
<P>IT is not improper to mention here, what &s;ome Hi&s;torians have, and not improperly &s;ugge&s;t|ed on this Occa&s;ion, that the great Ravages which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> made in <HI>America,</HI> at their fir&s;t land|ing among tho&s;e innocent People, and the Terror which their Cruelties &s;truck into the Minds of the Inhabitants, was &s;uch, as made all tho&s;e who were at di&s;tance &s;ufficient, fly for their Lives, with their Wives and their Children, into any of the ad|jacent Countries that would receive them, and that could &s;helter them from the Fury of their Enemies.</P>
<P>THAT thus, from the adjacent Countries of <HI>Peru</HI> We&s;t; from <HI>Nicaragua,</HI> and <HI>Guatimala,</HI> North-We&s;t; from that which we call <HI>New-Granada, Venezuela,</HI> and St. <HI>Martha</HI> North; in all which Countries, the Cruelties and Butcheries of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> were &s;ufficient to terrify the poor People; I &s;ay from the&s;e Parts it is &s;uppos'd va&s;t Multitudes, nay Millions of poor frighted People fled into the&s;e remoter Countries, among the Fa&s;tne&s;&s;es of inacce&s;&s;ible Woods, and Moun|tains; for the Cordileiros or Mountains of the

<P>AMONG the&s;e Waters they were &s;ecured, the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> being in no Condition for &s;uch a pur&s;uit, and finding al&s;o a &s;ufficient Wealth in the Palace of the Emperor of <HI>Peru</HI> to glut their Avarice, till they fell out about &s;haring the Spoil, and &s;o fell to killing one another, and gave the <HI>Indians</HI> &s;ome re&s;pit.</P>
<P>THAT the <HI>Peruvians</HI> fled hither, is le&s;s doubt|ed; for the <HI>Spaniards</HI> perceived, upon <HI>Pizarro</HI>'s murthering their King, and plundering his Pa|lace, that the People of the Country were as it were vani&s;h'd on a &s;udden, and to be &s;een no more; that is to &s;ay in &s;uch Multitudes as they at fir&s;t appear'd in; and yet they had not ma&s;&s;acred &s;o many of them, as they had done in other of the Provinces before.

<P N="2">II. FROM hence take a View of the Northern Parts of <HI>America,</HI> &s;uch of them as are known and di&s;cover'd; for it is not with the North of <HI>Ameri|ca</HI> as it is with the South. The South is known to be every where &s;urrounded by the Sea, except in the &s;mall I&s;thmus of <HI>Darien;</HI> and our <HI>European</HI> Ships of &s;everal Nations have &s;ail'd round it, and do &s;o continually. But as to the North Part, we have di&s;cover'd only one Side of it, namely, the Ea&s;t; we neither know its extent one way or o|ther, North or We&s;t, whether it joins We&s;t to the Land off <HI>Je&s;&s;o</HI> and <HI>Japan,</HI> or North to <HI>Europe,</HI> and the Lands round and beyond the Pole.</P>
<P>IT is di&s;cover'd indeed to <HI>Frobis&s;her</HI>'s <HI>Straights,</HI> and the Coa&s;t of <HI>Greenland,</HI> as far as to eighty Degrees North Latitude. But tho' all that Land how poor and how &s;everely Cold it may be, is yet inhabited; tho&s;e Inhabitants remain unvi&s;ited, except on the fir&s;t Di&s;covery, and the Country lyes abandon'd and de&s;erted.</P>
<P>WE have three great Inlets into the Land of <HI>North-America</HI> from the Sea; that is to &s;ay at <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Straights,</HI> and all the &s;everal Bays call'd <HI>Davis</HI>'s, <HI>Baffins</HI>'s, <HI>Button</HI>'s, and <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s, but little or no Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion; and all to the We&s;tward of tho&s;e Bays, be it as far as <HI>A&s;ia</HI> or not, tho' full of
<PB N="285" REF="299">
People, is unpo&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the <HI>Europeans,</HI> except our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Settlements at the bottom of <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Bay;</HI> where at be&s;t, we have not two hundred People; &s;o all tho&s;e deep Bays are in the Hands of the Na|tives, of what Nation &s;oever they may be call'd, and how Numerous &s;oever they are.</P>
<P>THE next Inlet the <HI>Europeans</HI> have into the Land is, by the River of <HI>Canada</HI> or St. <HI>Laurence;</HI> and here the <HI>French</HI> indeed vi&s;it and di&s;cover great Tracts of Land up to the Lakes <HI>Heuron, Illonois,</HI> and &s;everal others. But what are all the Countries that the <HI>French</HI> have planted? Are they not full of the Native Inhabitants uncon|quer'd, un&s;ubdued, and who live under their own Kings or <HI>Cai&s;icks,</HI> and govern'd by their own Laws, make Peace and War ab&s;olutely as they plea&s;e? The <HI>French</HI> are only a handful of People here and there planting a little Ground, by the Banks of the Lakes and Rivers; and who being di&s;pers'd into many Places, and at great Di&s;tances, are not to be nam'd with the infinite Multitudes of People which &s;pread over all that Country to the We&s;t.</P>
<P>LET any one that plea&s;es to follow this Ob&s;er|vation read but Father <HI>Hennepin,</HI> and the Di&s;co|veries of Mon&s;ier <HI>De Salle,</HI> of <HI>Ferdinand Soto,</HI> and of &s;everal others; and they will find that the undi&s;|cover'd Country is, to that planted by the <HI>French</HI> more than as ten thou&s;and to one.</P>
<P>EVEN the Colonies of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in <HI>New Eng|land, New-York, New-Jer&s;ey,</HI> &amp;c. What are they but a long mea&s;ur'd out Plantation upon the Coa&s;t? None of tho&s;e Colonies have any Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions or cul|tivated Lands above 150 Miles from the Sea worth naming. Let them go up the River from <HI>New-York</HI> to <HI>Albany,</HI> which is the highe&s;t and mo&s;t remote of all the Colonies, or up the <HI>Delaware</HI> Ri|ver, where the Waters joyn almo&s;t with tho&s;e of <HI>Vir|ginia;</HI> nay, let us take the third great Inlet of
<PB N="286" REF="300">
Water, which is that we call the Bay of <HI>Che&s;ea|peake;</HI> yet even here the bottom of the Bay is not above two hundred Miles from the Capes or En|trance; and as it goes away North, it is not full 150 from the Sea in a Line, the Bay running away due North, after it receives the fir&s;t Rivers of <HI>James</HI> and <HI>York</HI> and <HI>Rapahannock.</HI></P>
<P>WHAT then are the&s;e Colonies, tho' Great in them&s;elves, and Powerful and Potent, as now en|creas'd, compar'd to the va&s;t Continent of <HI>North-America?</HI> who&s;e extent North I have de&s;crib'd a little, and who&s;e We&s;tern Coa&s;t is not yet di&s;co|ver'd? neither do we yet know whether, <HI>as I &s;aid,</HI> it is bounded by the Sea <HI>yea</HI> or <HI>no.</HI></P>
<P>HOW little then of this newly di&s;cover'd World is yet known, compar'd to what there is yet left to know? And what room is here &s;till for the indu&s;trious World to put them&s;elves forth for the extending the Di&s;coveries already made, and form|ing the Nations, whether by Conque&s;ts or other|wi&s;e, into Societies, both for Commerce and for Strength?</P>
<P>THIS Part, tho' remote from the pre&s;ent Ar|gument, is not &s;o far from the de&s;ign of this Work: And tho' it may be &s;poken of more largely here|after by it&s;elf, yet I may take this Notice of it here; <HI>namely,</HI> that this very thought opens a Door for future Ages, and for yet more enterprizing Na|tions, to think of enlarging the <HI>European</HI> Settle|ments in all the&s;e Parts of <HI>America;</HI> which as it may ea&s;ily be done by making their beginning with &s;ufficient Strength and Numbers of People; &s;o where attempted with &s;uch &s;ufficient Numbers, the fertility of the Soil may more than &s;ufficiently an&s;wer for the Succe&s;s. For no Plantation under|taken by &s;ufficient Numbers of indu&s;trious People can fail of Succe&s;s, if the fertility of the Soil is &s;uch, as may an&s;wer to produce, the ble&s;&s;ing of
<PB N="287" REF="301">
Heaven concurring, a &s;ufficient encrea&s;e for their Sub&s;i&s;tence. To make this fea&s;ible in any Place, I &s;hall in &s;hort propo&s;e it for one Place, in the Manner following.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="22" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXII. <HI>A Propo&s;al for a new Settlement in</HI> America, <HI>being wholly founded on the mere Improve|ment of the Land as a Plantation, without any view of Commerce till after the fir&s;t Suc|ce&s;s is a&s;certained.</HI></HEAD>
<P>THERE is a large tract of Land in <HI>America</HI> unpo&s;&s;e&s;s'd at pre&s;ent by any <HI>European</HI> Na|tion; abandon'd for &s;o long, as that, even the <HI>Spa|niards</HI> them&s;elves do not, and cannot, even by a long pre&s;cription of Years, lay any Claim to it.</P>
<P>THIS is that Country, beginning at the Plains of St. <HI>Andrew,</HI> above the Bay of that Name, about 120 Miles South of the <HI>Rio de la Plata,</HI> in the Lati|tude of thirty &s;even, and reaching to <HI>Port St. Julien,</HI> in the Latitude of fifty to fifty one, being in length fourteen Degrees, or 840 Miles from North-Ea&s;t to South-We&s;t.</P>
<P>THIS Country extends from Ea&s;t to We&s;t, from the Shore of the <HI>Atlantick Ocean</HI> to the Ea&s;t|&s;ide of the Mountains of the <HI>Andes,</HI> which limit the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of the <HI>Spaniards</HI> in that part of the Kingdom of <HI>Chili,</HI> which extent is in the mo&s;t Nor|thern part at lea&s;t 1200 Miles, narrowing gradually, as the Continent is narrow'd to the South-We&s;t, till
<PB N="288" REF="302">
off of <HI>Port St. Julien,</HI> at the Mouth of that River the breadth is about 560 Miles.</P>
<P>AS the Climate in this Latitude mu&s;t nece&s;&s;ari|ly be Temperate, the colde&s;t Winds, which in a South Latitude mu&s;t blow from the South, coming over but a &s;mall tract of Land, and then blowing every way from the Sea: So Experience of Tra|vellers a&s;&s;ures us of another important Article for Temper of Air, <HI>(viz.)</HI> That the Surface is general|ly <HI>Plain,</HI> not Mountanious and Hilly; and Dry, not Boggy or Fenny; fully &s;uited, and indeed pre|par'd by Nature to produce Gra&s;s and Corn, the two great Articles of Man's Su&s;tenance, and to make a healthy Climate both for Man and Bea&s;t.</P>
<P>THAT the Soil bears Gra&s;s in a great and ex|traordinary Manner, we have fir&s;t the Te&s;timony of &s;everal <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> who have view'd it, and have found for above 100 Miles within the Land, the whole Surface cover'd with good Gra&s;s, fit for Pa&s;turage of Cattle; and as far as they could &s;ee, the Plains lay extended every way, all full of excellent Gra&s;s, high in its Sea&s;on as a Man's Knee; and when graz'd down by the Cattle, mat|ted with Clover, and an excellent Turf fit for Sheep or Hor&s;es, and as good as can any where be &s;een.</P>
<P>THAT this Gra&s;s is &s;weet and good, qualify'd to feed and fat up the large&s;t black Cattle, is evi|dent, pa&s;t Contradiction, from this, that the black Cattle carry'd into the <HI>Buenos Ayres,</HI> and other Parts, by the <HI>Spaniards</HI> and <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> having been &s;uffer'd to run Wild, have &s;o encreas'd, and &s;pread them&s;elves to the Southward of the River <HI>De la Plata,</HI> that mo&s;t of this Country is over-run with them; and the Hunters from the <HI>Buenos Ayres</HI> make it a very great Trade to kill them for their Hides; which is the chief return of Merchandize
<PB N="289" REF="303">
which they now bring from that Port, the Ports South of <HI>Peru</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P>THE fertility of the Soil and temperature of the Climate thus a&s;certain'd, what remains then to &s;ecure a flouri&s;hing Settlement but beginning &s;uch an Undertaking with a &s;ufficiency of two Things?</P>
<P N="1">I. A SUFFICIENT &s;tore of Corn for Bread only, for &s;upport of the Colony for one Year, till the Land being cultivated and planted might pro|duce a Sufficiency of their own for future Supply.</P>
<P N="2">II. A SUFFICIENT Force to pre&s;erve and protect the Settlement again&s;t any a&s;&s;ault of the <HI>Spani|ards;</HI> as to the Natives, their Number is not con&s;iderable.</P>
<P>AS to Fle&s;h, the Country abounding in Deer, and Black-Cattle, there wou'd be no need to pro|vide. But le&s;t the Pains of Hunting &s;hou'd be thought too great a Hindrance of the more needful Work of planting the Land, a Breed of Cattle might be taken in, either at our own Colonies of <HI>New-England</HI> and <HI>Virginia,</HI> or at the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> where the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> have a very great plenty of all kinds, as Cows, Hor&s;es, and Hogs.</P>
<P>NOW, not to enlarge on the &s;everal Excellencies of this Country for a Colony, it is particularly adapted for a Colony of <HI>Engli&s;h;</HI> by the aptne&s;s of the Climate and of the Soil, for all the u&s;ual growth of <HI>England,</HI> &s;uch as <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Corn for Bread, Barley for Malt, Apples and &s;uch other kinds for Cyder, &amp;c. In &s;hort, the Country is as it were &s;ingled out for <HI>Engli&s;hmen;</HI> not only to live in, but to live ju&s;t after the manner of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> People's liv|ing. Not too hot to bear Wheat, or to make Malt, or to pre&s;erve Beer; not too cold to produce
<PB N="290" REF="304">
the tenderer Plants for Kitchen Gardening, for wearing Cloths, and dre&s;&s;ing after the ordinary Manner; or too Cold for the Health and Safety of the Cattle, who in violent Colds, deep Snows, and continued Fro&s;ts, peri&s;h for want of Food.</P>
<P>NOR is the Country over-grown with Woods, &s;o as in <HI>New-England, Virginia,</HI> and all the Nor|thern Colonies, where there is no pre&s;ent Planting till after immen&s;e Labour and Expence to clear the Ground of Timber, and prepare it for the Corn; whereas this Country, tho' &s;upply'd with Woods at proper Di&s;tances, lyes already plain, over-grown with good Turf, is already good Pa&s;|ture, and the Plow may be immediately &s;et into it to make it good Arable.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e Advantages take the following Ne|gatives.</P>
<P N="1">I. HERE are no venemous Creatures; &s;uch as in the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> the Country is dangerou&s;ly full of, <HI>(viz)</HI> Here are no Snakes and Serpents; of which in the <HI>Bra&s;ils,</HI> they find &s;ome as big as a Man's Thigh, and fifteen to twenty Foot long.</P>
<P N="2">II. No Lions, Tygers, Wolves, Elephants, Bears, or other ravenous and furious Bea&s;ts, at lea&s;t we do not read or learn from Travellers who have been on Shore here, that any &s;uch Creatures were ever &s;een; no nor &s;o much as Monkeys and Baboons; a kind of Creatures many ways mi&s;|chievous and de&s;tructive to the diligent Planter.</P>
<P N="3">III. No Allegators or Crocodiles in the Rivers, nor any other noxious Creatures, at lea&s;t not that I have heard or read of, and I have been diligent to gain Information by both.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="305">
WITH all the&s;e Encouragements, What &s;hou'd hinder a Colony being planted here with Succe&s;s? All the Mi&s;carriages of former Colonies wou'd be &s;ecur'd again&s;t here. It is ob&s;ervable, that all the Plantations which the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> e&s;tabli&s;h'd in <HI>North-America</HI> met with great Difficulties, and Di&s;appoint|ments in their Beginnings, but that all of them hap|pen'd from &s;ome other of the&s;e Cau&s;es and Accidents.</P>
<P N="1">I. THE Treachery or Fal&s;hood and Cruelty of the Natives or <HI>Indians.</HI> Thus in <HI>Virginia</HI> they &s;uffer'd two Ma&s;&s;acres; and in <HI>New-England,</HI> three very fierce Wars, all in the infancy of their Settlements, and almo&s;t to their Ruin.</P>
<P N="2">II. DISSENTION among them&s;elves, which was twice the Ruin of <HI>Virginia</HI> in particular.</P>
<P N="3">III. NEGLECT of Friends in <HI>Europe</HI> not &s;upplying them in time, till they, having no Product of their own, have been ready to &s;tarve; nay, &s;ome have peri&s;h'd, and others abandon'd the Colo|nies, by rea&s;on of the extreme Nece&s;&s;ities they have been reduc'd to.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e three Heads are and may be effec|tually guarded again&s;t in this Settlement, and that in &s;uch a manner as to be without the lea&s;t Appre|hen&s;ions of them, or any of them. For as to Na|tives, as I have &s;aid, here are no Numbers to make them formidable; and as to the <HI>Spaniards</HI> either they are to be treated with, or fought with, and either of them is ea&s;y enough.</P>
<P>As to private Di&s;&s;ention, an e&s;tabli&s;h'd Autho|rity and Government &s;ent with them, may &s;uffi|ciently provide again&s;t and prevent it.</P>
<P>AND as to Supplies, a &s;ufficient Magazine car|ry'd at fir&s;t, puts the Colony out of Fear, the Soil
<PB N="292" REF="306">
being ready for the Plow as &s;oon as they come there, which was not the Ca&s;e in any of the other.</P>
<P>SUCH a Colony being &s;ettled in this manner and &s;ecured of Succe&s;s, the next Enquiry wou'd be, What encrea&s;e of Commerce wou'd this be to us, and how wou'd they Trade?</P>
<P>SIR <HI>John Narbrough,</HI> a well known Per&s;on for his Experience in &s;uch Things as the&s;e, being &s;ent by King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second in the <HI>Sweep&s;takes</HI> Man of War for the di&s;covery of the Straights of <HI>Ma|gellan,</HI> winter'd in this Port, and went &s;everal times on Shore with twenty or thirty Men at a time, &s;preading them&s;elves, &s;ometimes one way and &s;ometimes another, to take a view of the Land, and gives the &s;ame Account as I have had confirm'd from other Hands; and as I have here taken No|tice of, <HI>(viz.)</HI> that the Ground is not Mountain|ous; he likens it to <HI>New-market Heath,</HI> that it bears excellent &s;weet and good Gra&s;s, and wou'd bear good Corn.</P>
<P>HE confirms al&s;o, that they found in all their &s;tay there, nothing Venemous, nothing Rave|nous, no noxious Vermin, In&s;ects, or Serpents, nor any of tho&s;e mo&s;t nau&s;eous of all Gods Creatures, Monkies or Apes; but O&s;triches and Guianacoes, that is <HI>Peruvian</HI> Sheep, which are as large as Mules, and carry Burthens like Mules in <HI>Peru,</HI> as al&s;o abundance of Deer.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the Subject of Commerce, for without Commerce, &s;ay the enquiring World, of what u&s;e is a Colony? To this I an&s;wer:</P>
<P N="1">I. NUMBERS of People make Commerce in the very con&s;equence of their living together. And there|fore the fir&s;t Article wou'd be, that as they mu&s;t have all their Clothes, Uten&s;ils, and Furniture, from <HI>Europe,</HI> there wou'd be immediately, with a new encrea&s;e of People, a new Con&s;umption of
<PB N="293" REF="307">
the Woollen and Linen Manufactures of <HI>Europe,</HI> be&s;ides all the nece&s;&s;ary demands of Iron, Bra&s;s, Lead, Tin, Copper, &amp;c. in all the nece&s;&s;ary Materials for the Conveniencies of Life.</P>
<P N="2">II. THE Inhabitants, who, tho' not &s;o numerous as to be trouble&s;ome or dangerous, yet are not want|ing wou'd &s;oon be civiliz'd, &s;o as to wear Clothes of &s;ome &s;ort or other, and con&s;equently wou'd encrea&s;e the &s;aid Con&s;umption.</P>
<P N="3">III. THERE could be no que&s;tion, but that a Cor|re&s;pondence wou'd be &s;oon e&s;tabli&s;h'd over the <HI>Andes,</HI> or by Pa&s;&s;ages which the Natives wou'd di&s;cover into <HI>Chili,</HI> and &s;o to the <HI>South Seas;</HI> and whether the Corre&s;pondence were with the na|tive <HI>Chilians,</HI> or with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or with both, the con&s;equence wou'd certainly be a very great Market for all kinds of <HI>European</HI> Goods, e&s;pecially our own <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Product and Manufac|tures as above.</P>
<P N="4">IV. AND to crown all, I cannot doubt, but &s;uch an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Colony, as they grew great and con|&s;equently &s;trong, wou'd be able to extend them|&s;elves into <HI>Chili</HI> it&s;elf, &s;o as to plant there, and &s;ecure to them&s;elves &s;ome important Harbour on the Shore of the <HI>South-Seas;</HI> of which there are many, which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> have not po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of, and never had any, whatever Claim they may make to the Property of them, according to their antient Pretences, that the Pope gave them a Right to all the Kingdoms of the <HI>Ameri|can</HI> World; which was no more the Pope's to give than it was the King of <HI>Spain</HI>'s before he gave it; &s;o that the Right is undoubtedly in the <HI>Chi|lians</HI> or native Inhabitants; who as they were never conquer'd, and never conceded their
<PB N="294" REF="308">
Right to the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> or to any other Nation; &s;o they have &s;till a Right of Inheritance, and may concede it to the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> or any other Na|tion what&s;oever.</P>
<P>THIS Part, and the Advantages of it to <HI>Eng|land</HI> above any Colony, or indeed above all the Colonies they yet po&s;&s;e&s;s in <HI>America,</HI> wou'd take up a Volume by it&s;elf to enlarge upon; it is evi|dent at fir&s;t &s;ight, that there is in its view an Ocean of Commerce, and a Sea of Wealth, were it rightly pur&s;ued; but I cannot dwell upon it here.</P>
<P>HOWEVER I mu&s;t not leave it abruptly neither, for in farther An&s;wer to the Que&s;tion propo&s;ed, about what benefit of Commerce wou'd come from &s;uch a Colony, it remains to &s;ay what Returns we &s;hall find there. How &s;hall the Ships be freighted back? And how &s;hall they pay for the Goods they will take from us?</P>
<P>I MUST confe&s;s it is not likely that a Country &s;o well &s;ituated for a Plantation, and &s;o encourag|ing for People, &s;hou'd want a Product to return to <HI>Europe;</HI> and tho' it may not be obvious to a Stran|ger at fir&s;t View, give me leave to &s;ay in the Ge|neral, 'tis only the be&s;t qualify'd for, and the be&s;t furni&s;h'd with Returns, of any Country wherever the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> are yet planted on the Continent of <HI>America.</HI></P>
<P><HI>NEW-ENGLAND</HI> and <HI>New-York,</HI> and all our Northern Colonies are di&s;tre&s;s'd for Returns; and were it not for our I&s;lands which take off their Corn and Cattle, <HI>(viz.)</HI> Their Flower, Peas and Malt (in Beer) their Fi&s;h, Pork, Beef, Hor&s;es, and Lumber, they wou'd not be able to pay <HI>England</HI> for the Clothes they wear; and in&s;tead of being an Advantage wou'd be an in&s;upportable Burthen to us and to them&s;elves; for they have nothing to make Returns to <HI>England</HI> in, but Furs and Skins of
<PB N="295" REF="309">
Bea&s;ts, which they call Peltry, Train-Oil, Tur|pentine, Rice, and Tobacco; the two la&s;t appro|priate to <HI>Carolina</HI> and <HI>Virginia;</HI> the re&s;t wou'd not in their Value load the tenth part of the Ships that go thither, or pay for one twentieth part of the Goods they con&s;ume. But here on the contra|ry, are &s;everal rich and valuable Articles for Re|turns, of which, as the Country can never be ex|hau&s;ted, &s;o we can never be glutted with the Quantity.</P>
<P N="1">I. AS the Mountains of the <HI>Andes</HI> are known to be full of Gold on the We&s;t-&s;ide, by which the <HI>Spaniards</HI> receive from the Country of <HI>Chili</HI> an immen&s;e Trea&s;ure every Year, yet are not &s;aid to have made any effectual Search, &s;uch is their Sloth, or to find any more of it than the Na|tives bring them from the Rills and Brooks i&s;&s;u|ing every where out of the Hills; &s;o it cannot be rea&s;onably doubted, but that the Rivers and Brooks i&s;&s;uing from the &s;ame Mountains on the Ea&s;t-&s;ide, and of which there are an exceeding great Number, mu&s;t partake of the &s;ame Trea&s;ure; to which Ea&s;tern-&s;ide of the Mountains this Co|lony wou'd immediately extend it&s;elf.</P>
<P>NOR do I &s;peak this only upon the probability of it, as above, but the Experience of divers, who have travers'd the Country, even clo&s;e up to tho&s;e Mountains, from the <HI>Rio dela Plata,</HI> who confirm it, that it is really &s;o. And Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI> in his Wintering there, as above, found &s;everal &s;mall pieces of Gold, tho' at &s;o great a Di&s;tance.</P>
<P>SO that upon the whole there is a moral Cer|tainty of Gold; and that even, tho' a Communi|cation with <HI>Chili</HI> &s;hould not be obtain'd; and if it &s;hould be obtain'd, as it does not &s;eem rational to que&s;tion, then the having Gold in any rea&s;onable
<PB N="296" REF="310">
Quantity, is no more to be doubted, than it is, that there are Rivers i&s;&s;uing from the Mountains and running into the <HI>South Seas.</HI></P>
<P N="2">II. THERE is a Commodity infinitely valuable in <HI>Europe,</HI> becau&s;e extreamly wanted, and in its proportion as &s;ure a Wealth as Gold it&s;elf, and that is <HI>Salt-Petre.</HI> This we have likewi&s;e the Te&s;timony of Sir <HI>John Narbrough</HI> for, who a&s;|&s;erts it of his own Knowledge, both as to the <HI>Quality</HI> and the <HI>Quantity;</HI> that it is found on the Surface of the Earth, and in &s;everal Pits; &s;o that as he gave King <HI>Charles</HI> an account, many Ships might be loaded with it.</P>
<P N="3">III.

<P>THERE are many navigable Rivers which give Inlets into the Country, and con&s;equently make farther Di&s;coveries ea&s;y; the Sea is full of Fi&s;h, and at lea&s;t there can be no que&s;tion but great Quantities of Train Oil would be made; &s;o that in a Word there could be no want of Returns to &s;upport and e&s;tabli&s;h Trade.</P>
<P>THE Product of Corn wou'd be great, and on Occa&s;ion they might come in for a &s;hare of &s;elling it to the <HI>Portugue&s;e</HI> in <HI>Bra&s;il;</HI> who tho' they have plenty of other Grain, yet are always willing to buy <HI>European</HI> Flower, which this wou'd be, tho growing in <HI>America.</HI> But &s;hou'd that fail, it is not a longer Voyage, nor any way &s;o hazardous, to <HI>Barbadoes</HI> and <HI>Jamaica,</HI> than it is from <HI>Ireland</HI> to tho&s;e I&s;lands; &s;o that they might &s;end Beef, and Pork, and Flower, and Beer, directly thither, the Voyage taking at the medium of the Colony, be|ing 1140 Leagues, that is to &s;ay, from forty De|grees South, to thirteen or &s;eventeen Degrees North, with very little variation of Longitude: Whereas from <HI>England</HI> to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and thence to <HI>Barbadoes,</HI> is thirty &s;even Degrees in Latitude, <HI>(viz)</HI> from fifty to thirteen, be&s;ides the We&s;ting in Longitude, and be&s;ides the danger of the Voyage.</P>

<P>I SHOULD now go back to the Di&s;coveries made in the fifteenth and &s;ixteenth Century, and proceed to take Notice, how, in con&s;equence of that great Di&s;covery of all, I mean <HI>the Compa&s;s,</HI> Navigation being as it were let loo&s;e, and the Sea|man's Hands unty'd, which were fetter'd and manacl'd before by their Ignorance, not daring to venture far from the Shores; I &s;ay in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="299" REF="313">
of this great Di&s;covery, all the <HI>European</HI> Nations went to work, &s;preading the Seas with Ships, and &s;earching every part of the Ocean for new Worlds.</P>
<P><HI>GAMA</HI> and <HI>Diaz,</HI> who had, as above, tra|vers'd the main Land of <HI>Afric,</HI> to the Cape <HI>de Bona E&s;peranza,</HI> and about to <HI>Melinda</HI> and <HI>Mo&s;ambique,</HI> now launc'd out Ea&s;tward; and pa&s;&s;ing the great I&s;land of <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> as a thing beneath their Ambition, and which they might &s;ecure after|wards, pre&s;s'd on over the <HI>Indian Ocean</HI> till they happily di&s;cover'd the Coa&s;t of <HI>India</HI> it&s;elf: And the fir&s;t Place they landed upon was at <HI>Calicut,</HI> where they fix'd and fortifyed; from thence they coa&s;ted the Shores of <HI>Malabar,</HI> and di&s;cover'd the I&s;land of <HI>Ceylon,</HI> loading their Ships with Pepper, Cinamon, and other Spices; as al&s;o Callicoes and Silks, and in &s;hort a prodigious Cargo came back. Upon the &s;ame Coa&s;t they &s;aw and &s;et their Hearts upon the City of <HI>Goa,</HI> tho' not in Condition then to attack it, but from thence they &s;teer'd We&s;t again for <HI>Madaga&s;car,</HI> where they landed, gave the Name of St. <HI>Augu&s;tine</HI> to the Bay and Port, which &s;till retains that Name; victualled their Ships with good Beef &s;alted and dryed in the Sun, &s;tor'd them&s;elves with fre&s;h Provi&s;ions, Wood and Water, and came &s;afe back to <HI>Lisbon,</HI> making a mo&s;t &s;ur|prizing advantage of the Voyage, which caus'd them to fit out again three Ships the next Year: Then they &s;eiz'd upon the City of <HI>Goa,</HI> but were beaten out of it again by the <HI>Indians,</HI> but the next Year took it again, and have kept it to this Day. And making this the center of all their Acqui&s;iti|ons in the <HI>Indies,</HI> proceeded to the Ea&s;tern Part, and in three Years afterwards made them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of all the re&s;t of the trading Parts or Coa&s;ts of <HI>India;</HI> &s;uch as that of <HI>Coramondel, Golconda,</HI>

<P>How they were afterwards wound out of all the&s;e again, either by Force or Stratagem, or both being, &s;upplanted and driven from them all by the <HI>Dutch,</HI> is matter of Hi&s;tory, not of Di&s;coveries or Improvements, and &s;o does not relate to the Subject I am upon.</P>

DURING the&s;e Acqui&s;itions of the <HI>Fortugue&s;e,</HI> which were indeed infinitely beyond what any other Nations had made at that time, the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> labouring as it might be &s;aid not in the Fire, but in the Extremities of Cold, made equvalent Di&s;co|veries to the North, not at that time equivalent in Wealth, but afterwards by the inimitable and un|weary'd Diligence of the People, made equivalent in every thing; I mean their &s;everal Plantations of <HI>Virginia, Newfoundland, New-England, Bermudas, Hud&s;on</HI>'s <HI>Bay,</HI> and &s;uch other Colonies as they fix'd upon, on the Continent, or near it, of <HI>North A|merica;</HI> and which we have &s;ince &s;een improv'd al&s;o in their Degree to an unexpected Magnitude; I &s;ay unexpected, becau&s;e of the Difficulties which they met with in their fir&s;t Attempts; by the Re|pul&s;es from the Natives, who many times furiou&s;|ly &s;upplanted them, de&s;troying at once the Labours of many Years, and &s;ometimes treacherou&s;ly ma&s;&s;a|cring and murthering the People: Notwith&s;tand|ing all which, we find them now advantagiou&s;ly planted; and by the force of Indu&s;try, and the help of Commerce, we &s;ee tho&s;e Colonies yielding a Return of <HI>Tobacco, Rice,</HI> rich <HI>Furs, Trayn Oil, Turpentine, Fi&s;h,</HI> and &s;undry other Productions of the Continent; and <HI>Sugars, Indico, Ginger, Cotton, Cocoa, Pimento,</HI> and other Productions of the I&s;lands, which are in their amounts, and as im|prov'd by our Trade, equal to the Gold of the <HI>Bra|&s;ils</HI> and the Silver of <HI>Poto&s;i.</HI></P>
<P>IN the &s;ame compa&s;s of time we find the <HI>French</HI> making Di&s;coveries in the Bay of St. <HI>Laurence,</HI> the Rivers of <HI>Canada</HI> and <HI>Mi&s;&s;i&s;&s;ipi,</HI> and planting the Inland part of <HI>North America;</HI> from whence how|ever they have as yet found nothing to bring back, but Furs from the Land, and Fi&s;h from the Sea; which notwith&s;tanding has made tho&s;e Colonies very profitable to them.

Share of the I&s;land Colonies, together with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the <HI>Caribees</HI> or <HI>Antilles I&s;lands;</HI> &s;uch as St. <HI>Martin, Guadaloup, Santa Cruz, Marygalante, Petit Guaves,</HI> a Colony on the Ea&s;t-end of <HI>Hi&s;panio|la,</HI> al&s;o <HI>Martinico, Granade,</HI> and &s;everal others of &s;maller note, but chiefly upon <HI>Newfoundland,</HI> where they have improv'd the Fi&s;hery to a con&s;iderable degree.</P>
<P>IT is true the <HI>Dutch</HI> had no Share in the&s;e Im|provements; however they came in afterwards by way of Spoil, upon the Improvement and Labour of the <HI>Portugue&s;e,</HI> as has been &s;aid. We are to under&s;tand that the <HI>Dutch</HI> were at this time labouring under the Weight of a terrible War with the <HI>Spaniards,</HI> and were not a State, or Government, or People, till many Years after the&s;e fir&s;t Di&s;coveries, as all that know any thing of their Hi&s;tory mu&s;t needs know; it is no Wonder therefore, that the <HI>Dutch,</HI> however diligent a People they are, and fam'd for their Application, even to Di&s;coveries; yet as they were Subjects to the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> and had no Being as a Nation, they could not be concern'd in any of the mo&s;t ear|ly Improvements and Di&s;coveries of tho&s;e Times.</P>

<HEAD>The CONCLUSION.</HEAD>
<P>AS the&s;e four Months of this Work bring down the mo&s;t early Di&s;coveries and fir&s;t Improve|ments of Mankind to a particular Period; I mean the time when by the di&s;covery of the Magnet and the u&s;e of the Compa&s;s, Men were particularly qualify'd to vi&s;it remote Countries, and make both Di&s;coveries and Improvements al&s;o in Trade and Plantation; &s;o really it wou'd be abrupt to publi&s;h them to the World thus in one Article without &s;umming up briefly what is pa&s;t, and tak|ing a little notice of what is to come.</P>
<P>IT could not be, but that when we come to run over the Advances which the Men of the mo&s;t early Ages made in the&s;e u&s;eful Branches of human Knowledge, &s;uch as Art, Science, and the planting foreign and new di&s;cover'd Countries abroad, our account &s;hould be a kind of an abridg|ment of Things, and we &s;hou'd be able to &s;peak but to Generals only. It was indeed impo&s;&s;ible it &s;hou'd be otherwi&s;e for the improving Nations left few Accounts of their Improvements behind them; the Ages gave no Hi&s;tories of the Undertaking, or of the Undertakers; we have little left to judge of their Works but by the Effects of them.</P>
<P>WE know the <HI>Phoenicians</HI> planted Colonies at <HI>Carthage</HI> and at <HI>Cadiz,</HI> and we know the <HI>Carthagi|nians</HI> planted again on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> and of <HI>Europe,</HI> every way; becau&s;e we have &s;een the Co|lonies planted, bearing the Image and Super&s;crip|tion, nay the very Names of its Planters; and re|maining after <HI>Carthage</HI> it&s;elf has been de&s;troy'd; as at <HI>Cartagena</HI> in particular the Name is pre&s;erv'd,
<PB N="304" REF="318">
and the Memory and Idolatry, the very Cu&s;toms, Rites, and U&s;ages of the <HI>Carthaginians</HI> were found among the <HI>Moors</HI> when the <HI>Mahometans</HI> came upon them, and are among &s;ome of the Southern Natives to this Day.</P>
<P>FROM the &s;catter'd Remains of <HI>Roman</HI> Antiqui|ty in all the Nations where the Eagle &s;pread its victorious Wings much of the <HI>Roman</HI> Hi&s;tory is drawn out, and the many Breaches and Inter&s;ecti|ons of the Hi&s;torian's lo&s;t Labours are &s;upplyed.</P>
<P>FROM the Sy&s;tems of a few of the antient <HI>Greek</HI> Philo&s;ophers the Wi&s;dom of the Wi&s;emen of the <HI>South</HI> is handed down to us, and by the Frag|ments of A&s;tronomy, us'd by the Antients, the more perfect Experiments have been made; &s;o that Learning &s;eems to be de&s;cended to the pre&s;ent Ages by Inheritance, and they &s;tand upon the Shoulders of the <HI>Chaldaeans, Per&s;ian,</HI> and <HI>Arabian</HI> A&s;trologers; that is to &s;ay Star-gazers, for they were but little better at fir&s;t.</P>
<P>NOR can the particular Hi&s;tory of the gradual Improvements of the World in the&s;e &s;uperior Branches of human Knowledge be collected other|wi&s;e, than as they di&s;cover'd them&s;elves in now and then an extraordinary Man in the World. It was a dangerous thing for a Man to be a little more than ordinarily knowing in any Mathematical or A&s;tronomical Knowledge, the World &s;tood at Gaze at him; they either exalted him to the Skies, and plac'd them among the Gods; as <HI>Mercury</HI> and <HI>Bac|chus</HI> are &s;aid to be exalted, or plac'd them among the Wonders of Nature; as <HI>Atlas, Prometheus, Her|cules,</HI> and others; or condemn'd them as Witches, Wizards, and Dealers with the Devil; as Dr. <HI>Fau|&s;tus,</HI> Fryer <HI>Bacon,</HI> and &s;everal others more Modern have been &s;erv'd; who were hone&s;t Men, but more than ordinarily intimate Searchers into Na|ture,
<PB N="305" REF="319">
and thereby acquir'd a &s;tock of Knowledge &s;uperior to others in the Age they liv'd in.</P>
<P>THE Manner being thus imperfect, by which we have at be&s;t come at the knowledge of the mo&s;t antient Things; it follows, that our &s;earch into Antiquity mu&s;t be likewi&s;e very imperfect, and the Gradations of the Antients in their &s;everal Improvements in Science and u&s;eful Arts, very hard to de&s;cribe. It is enough therefore, and our Readers will we hope expect no more from us that we are able to deduce Things from ju&s;t Originals, and hand them down as Nature has been helped to hand them to us in the General, till we come to the Ages in which Hi&s;tory has been more regular in recording Things worthy to be known with a due certainty.</P>
<P>HITHERTO we have given an account of what the World did before, and without the helps of Art; now we mu&s;t enquire a little what the World did afterwards, and with &s;uch Helps, and how the Wi&s;emen of the World manag'd them&s;elves, after &s;uch u&s;eful Expedients, as the&s;e were introduc'd among them.</P>
<P>AS Heaven had ble&s;s'd them with &s;uch helps to Knowledge, we &s;ee they have not been idle, at lea&s;t the&s;e Northern Nations have not: And how have we by improving the&s;e noble Di&s;coveries learn'd to pity, or rather de&s;pi&s;e the re&s;t of the World, (who know nothing of them) as gro&s;ly ig|norant, &s;tupid, and uncapable?</P>
<P>IT will remain to the compleating this Work, that we &s;hould now go on to enquire into the &s;eve|ral Steps made upon the Foundation of the&s;e great and u&s;eful Di&s;coveries, for the encrea&s;e of the Wi&s;|dom and Under&s;tanding of Men; and for the car|rying on Commerce and Conque&s;t in the World; for it is apparent it has not been for nothing that
<PB N="306" REF="320">
Heaven has open'd the&s;e Trea&s;ures of Wi&s;dom and Knowledge to the World.</P>
<P>WHAT Embelli&s;hments then have they been to the Creation? What Beauties have they added to the Minds of Men? What Additions have they been to their Wealth, to their well living, and to their well doing? For Wi&s;emen will add every Day &s;omething by their Knowledge to every new thing they &s;ee and know.</P>
<P>THIS will be a very profitable Enquiry many Ways, and particularly as it will direct the World to the farther Improvements, they are yet to make upon mo&s;t, if not all the &s;everal Articles which are already improv'd.</P>
<P>THERE are no doubt new Countries and Lands yet to be di&s;cover'd, new Colonies to be planted, which were never di&s;cover'd, or planted before; and which is &s;till worth our Con&s;ideration tho&s;e al|ready planted are capable of new Improvements, and farther Planting, which I think I may call im|proving. For Example; I think no Man can doubt, at lea&s;t I cannot be per&s;waded to doubt, but that COFFEE might be made to grow in Countries of the &s;ame Latitude, and to the &s;ame Perfection as at <HI>Mocha;</HI> and we need never be at the Trouble and Expence to &s;end to the <HI>Arabian Gulph,</HI> and pay our Money in hard Species for it to the <HI>Turks,</HI> when it might be rais'd in the &s;ame or a more Southerly La|titude upon the Coa&s;t of <HI>Africa,</HI> or in the I&s;lands of <HI>America;</HI> in both which we are or may be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of Places of our own proper Growth for the plant|ing it. For Example, <HI>Mocha</HI> is upon the Continent of <HI>Arabia,</HI> in the Latitude of eleven Degrees or there|abouts; we again have a Factory at the Mouth of the <HI>Rio Grand,</HI> or near it, and at <HI>Sierra Leon</HI> in <HI>Africa:</HI> Why might not we be able to improve a Colony there, or thereabouts, for the planting of Coffee? as the <HI>Dutch,</HI> for Example, have &s;hown us the way,
<PB N="307" REF="321">
and done it at <HI>Batavia</HI> in much the &s;ame Latitude? Or if that will be &s;uppos'd not to be practicable, tho' I know not why, we have then I&s;lands in the <HI>We&s;t-Indies,</HI> which we call our own; &s;uch as <HI>Tobago,</HI> St. <HI>Vincent,</HI> and even <HI>Jamaica</HI> it&s;elf, which we have Rea&s;on to believe, tho' not exactly in the &s;ame La|titude, would all of them produce the Plant if it were try'd; but on the Coa&s;t of <HI>Guinea</HI> we have the very exact Latitude to plant it in, and therefore no Objection can lye again&s;t that.</P>
<P>IN the like Ca&s;e, can any Man per&s;wade us to believe, that <HI>Nutmegs</HI> and <HI>Mace</HI> will grow no where but in the I&s;le of <HI>Banda; Cloves</HI> no where but at <HI>Ternate, Amboyna,</HI> &amp;c. and <HI>Cinnamon</HI> no where but at <HI>Ceylon;</HI> that <HI>Tea</HI> will not grow in any Domini|ons but tho&s;e of <HI>China;</HI> or that the &s;ame Latitude and Temperature of Climate wou'd not produce the &s;ame Plants?</P>
<P>LET the Experiments be made and the Nega|tive prov'd, and then indeed no Man will oppo&s;e it; for Demon&s;tration puts an end to all Argu|ments; but till then we mu&s;t be allow'd to judge as Rea&s;on and the nature of Things direct us.</P>
<P>I MIGHT go on to explain my&s;elf as to Im|provements in many Ca&s;es, where &s;ome particular Plants u&s;eful in the World are kept up as a Proper|ty to &s;uch and &s;uch Nations, and no Body &s;uffer'd to Trade in them, but &s;uch and &s;uch; as Coche|neal &s;eems to be engro&s;s'd by the <HI>Spaniards;</HI> Su|gars to the <HI>American</HI> I&s;lands and Colonies; and &s;o many other Things which we are not able to pro|duce nearer home, by being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the &s;ame Climate in other Parts of the World; but this re|quires a farther room for Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
