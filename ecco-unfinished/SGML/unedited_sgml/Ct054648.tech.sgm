<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>THERE is no State of men more wretch|ed
than that of <HI>Authors;</HI> If they mi&s;|manage,
they meet with the de&s;erved
and unpitied Contempt, of all who &s;ee their
Works, or even hear of their Names. And let
them behave with all the &s;en&s;e and Addre&s;s
imaginable, they &s;hall move the Spleen of
the <HI>Wou'd be</HI>'s, the&s;e <HI>In&s;ects</HI> who make the
greate&s;t Splutter and Noi&s;e on the face of this
Earth: If they write for the whole Herd,
they rai&s;e as many Enemys, as there are half-witted
Pretenders (i. e. ninty nine parts of
an hundred) in the Book-learn'd World:
And if they lay in only for the Few, The&s;e
others &s;hall have 'em on the Head of Ob&s;cu|rity
and Pride. So that upon the whole
matter, to write well is only tolerable, but
not to write at all, is the wi&s;e&s;t thing a Man
of Sen&s;e can do. And I am &s;ure, nothing can
encourage an hone&s;t Man to in&s;truct the
World in de&s;pite of it &s;elf, but a con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
<PB REF="3">
he is doing his Duty, and promoting
one part of the De&s;ign of his Creation, <HI>viz.
The univer&s;al Benefit of Mankind.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Doctor Pitcairn,</HI> as the Nature of his
Employment required and as his own
&s;ingular A$ilities and Advantages enabled him,
was going on in adorning the Province com|mitted
to his tru&s;t, and had imparted to the
publick, &s;ome of his privat Meditations
and Ob&s;ervations; But no &s;ooner did
he appear in Print, but he was in hazard
of being Worried and torn in peices, by
two Bloody minded Bea&s;ts of Prey, who
fell upon him from different quarters; But
both with the &s;ame intent, being acted by
the &s;ame principle: However as good Luck
wou'd have it, It happened their rage was
only like that of Women, Impotent and loud:
The fir&s;t has already got his Reward, and is
gone to his Place of Oblivion and Contempt,
and the other will in due time follow.</P>
<P>In order to this, I have been tempted to
con&s;ider the Quarrel a little, and to examin
two <HI>Pamphlets</HI> written by <HI>D. Oliphant</HI> again&s;t
<HI>D. Pitcairns Di&s;&s;ertations,</HI> and <HI>The New
Theory of $evers:</HI> and I$ m mi&s;taken if I have
not managed the matter &s;o, as that his Ob|jections
have not only had their own, but an
additional Force; and that the an&s;wers do
<PB REF="4">
not only meet them, but take in all that $word$
po&s;&s;ible to be &s;aid on the&s;e Heads.</P>
<P>It is very hard to apply <HI>Geometry</HI> to <HI>Phy|&s;iology,</HI>
with &s;uch Accuracy and Nicene&s;s, as
to exclude all po&s;&s;ibility of Wrangling: We
mu&s;t make &s;ome Allowances, &amp; a&s;&s;ume &s;ome
<HI>Data</HI> (e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t Attempts of this
Kind) el&s;e we &s;hall never be able to enter
throughly into the Matters we de&s;ign to
handle: But then, if we rea&s;on fairly, and
reckon ju&s;tly from the&s;e Allowances, all
ingenious Men will be &s;atisfied with &s;uch
Performances, &s;ince it is all can be done in
the pre&s;ent Condition of <HI>Medicine</HI> and <HI>Philo|&s;ophie.</HI>
Much Malice, a very little Wit
and a &s;uperficial Knowledge of the Matter,
may furni&s;h out wherewith &s;eemingly to ex|po&s;e
the mo&s;t accurat Performances of this
Kind: But to find out where the Matter
truely halts, and to di&s;cover where <HI>Theories</HI>
are truely defective, requires other Mettle
than <HI>C. O.</HI> is made of. Such as he may rai&s;e
a little Du$, break a Window, or beat down
a Chimney (tho in his late attacks, he has
not done &s;o much as the&s;e) But the Fort
will &s;tand &s;afe and &s;ecure, when he and all
his weak Efforts, and the vain A&s;&s;aults of &s;uch
poor Enemies, have ebb'd into the Nothing
whence they came. Had I been of his coun|&s;el,
<PB REF="5">
I cou'd have told him &s;ome Objecti|ons
he might have made, with more &s;hew of
Rea&s;on, than the&s;e he has adduc'd; But who|ever
had the Capacity of making &s;uch, mu&s;t
have had the Ingenuity to acknowledge, they
were &s;uch as were unavoidable in the pre&s;ent
low E&s;tate of <HI>Medicine;</HI> Both which re|quir'd
a better Turn of Head &amp; more Hone&s;ty,
than <HI>C. O.</HI> has &s;hown in his late Works.</P>
<P>I acknowledge I have written the&s;e Papers
with more Edge, than became &s;o grave a &s;ub|ject
of Debate; But I'm affraid, tho&s;e who
con&s;ider the Maner after which he has treated
my <HI>Friend,</HI> and the Per&s;onal Provocations I
have receiv'd, will rather condemn me of <HI>In|&s;en&s;ibility</HI>
than <HI>Pa&s;&s;ion.</HI> It is impo&s;&s;ible to
read over his &s;currilous and abu&s;ive Pamph|letes,
without &s;ome degree of <HI>Indignation;</HI>
And <HI>C. O.</HI> (if he has any Sincerity) mu&s;t
acknowlege, I have treated him more civil|ly,
than he de&s;erv'd at my Hands, and have
left many things un&s;aid, to bring him to a
Sen&s;e of his Folly and ungratitude if po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>As for the <HI>Names</HI> he calls me, I do not
much trouble my &s;elf about them; they &s;erve
only (in all wi&s;e mens Opinions) to &s;how
the weakne&s;s of his Cau&s;e, the Di&s;temper
of his Mind, and how little able he is to
manage a Debate without Weapons from
<PB REF="6">
<HI>Bi$lingsgate.</HI> Call me what he plea&s;es, I
am &s;ure he can not call me <HI>Charles Oliphant.</HI>
He tells his Reader, He never intended to do
me any <HI>Harm,</HI> For which I thank him heartily,
and in Return I tell him, that neither he nor
any body el&s;e, ever dar'd to do me au inju|ry,
which I cou'd &s;ix upon him, which I
would not re&s;ent as became a <HI>Gentleman.</HI>
For <HI>that fellow,</HI> and &s;uch like Compliments,
I have not much to &s;ay. I do not de&s;ign to
bring in any into this Quarrel, but tho&s;e who
will nece&s;&s;arly intrude them&s;elves; And I
think Vanity alone, &s;ufficient to poi&s;on the
be&s;t Qualities belonging to the greate&s;t men:
But one thus provok'd wou'd &s;ay &s;omething,
that he might not be acconted Stupid; And
therefore, without any further Ceremony, I
tell <HI>C. O.</HI> that I reckon my &s;elf his Superior
in every thing, for which one Gentleman is
ju&s;tly more valuable than another; And I
challenge him to in&s;tance, wherein he thinks
the Advantage or Equality lyes on his Side.
There were once a few <HI>Problems</HI> of the mixt
kind, and of &s;ome u&s;e both in <HI>Philo&s;ophie</HI>
and <HI>Medicin</HI> which were hinted at in <HI>A. P</HI>'s
<HI>Di&s;&s;ertations</HI> and <HI>The New Theory of Fevers,</HI>
propos'd to him in may Name, to &s;hew he
did perfectly under&s;tand ne$ther of the&s;e
Books: They were indeed &s;uch ea&s;ie triffles,
<PB REF="7">
that I &s;hou'd have been a&s;ham'd, to have of|fered
them to any body el&s;e; But I knew a
<HI>Propo&s;ition</HI> of <HI>Euclid</HI> wou'd be too hard for
him; He very wi&s;ely declin'd 'em, di&s;dain|ing
to receive a Challenge from &s;uch a Hand:
But ev'ry body &s;aw into the Matter, had he
been able for 'em, we had heard of it; For
ev'ry one knows that it is not the Hand from
whom they are &s;ent, but the U&s;efullne&s;s of
the things, &amp; the Difficulty of their <HI>Inve&s;ti|gation,</HI>
that is to be con&s;idered in &s;uch Mat|ters.
I can when he plea&s;es &s;end hin a Score
&s;uch, of much greater difficulty, and of excel|lent
u&s;e in <HI>Medicine,</HI> any one of which if he
will undertake to &s;olve of him&s;elf, we &s;hall
grant him to be <HI>non adeo</HI> <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> as he
brags: On the other Hand. If he will plea&s;e
to &s;end me One, either relating to <HI>Philo&s;ophie,
Mathematicks</HI> or <HI>Medicine,</HI> which him&s;elf
can &s;olve and I decline, I &s;hall Sub&s;cibe my
&s;elf <HI>that little Pedan$</HI> he is pleas'd to call me.
All he has &s;aid, or can &s;ay again&s;t me or any
thing I have written, &s;hou'd never have pro|vok'd
me once to put Pen to Paper in An&s;wer.
I de&s;pi&s;e him too much, to have honour'd
him with a Reply; For I do not value what
they think of me, who can think well of <HI>C.
O.</HI> But when my <HI>Friend</HI> was injured, and at
the &s;ame time render'd uncapable of $word$
<PB REF="8">
him&s;elf right, by bu&s;ine&s;s of the greate&s;t im|portance
to Mankind, I was willing to throw
away a few lei&s;ure Hours, to expo&s;e the
Weakne&s;s and Malice of his Adver&s;ary.</P>
<P>I was once re&s;olv'd to have treated <HI>C. O.</HI>
and his Labours only in <HI>Ridicule,</HI> and to
have diverted the Reader at his Expen&s;e,
without entring upon any thing that was &s;e|rious;
But upon &s;econd Thoughts, I con&s;i|dered
that &s;uch a way of handling Matters,
was more in the power of a <HI>Player</HI> or a <HI>Fid|ler,</HI>
than that of even the mo&s;t accompli&s;hed
<HI>Philo&s;opher;</HI> That to form a ju&s;t and true
Knowledge of <HI>Nature,</HI> requir'd much La|bour
and indu&s;try, clo&s;e thinking and Ap|plication,
an exact Knowledge of <HI>Geometry</HI>
and <HI>Numbers,</HI> and nice Ob&s;ervations on the
manifold Appearances; But that toward a
<HI>Je&s;ter</HI> or <HI>Pun&s;ter,</HI> there went nothing but
much Forwardne&s;s, a triffling Humor and a
wanton Fancy; And upon this Con&s;ideration,
I re&s;olv'd to lay the Debate upon the right
Foot, and to make it go down with tho&s;e
who will not concern them&s;elves about our
Matters, I have giv'n &s;everal Hints of a Ju&s;|ter
and newer manner of Explaining &s;ome
Appearances in the <HI>Animal OEconomy,</HI> than
has hitherto been publi&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB REF="9">
<HI>C. O.</HI> is very angry with me, for &s;peaking
&s;o advantagiou&s;ly of <HI>A. P.</HI> in the <HI>New
Theory of Fevers:</HI> I do not intend here to
make his <HI>Panegyrick;</HI> I may perhaps have a
fitter Occa&s;ion to acknowledge my Obligati|ons
to him; But this I can &s;ay, that what I
there &s;poke of him, was not meant in Pre|judice
of any, who might lay a ju&s;t Claim to
a &s;hare of the Gratitude of their Countrey,
for improving <HI>Medicine</HI> or any other Art or
Science in it. I cou'd in&s;tance a great many
of other Countries, who have publickly &s;aid
much more to his Advantage, than I did. If
&s;ome other Phy&s;icians of our Countrey (whom
$ will not mention, without their own per|mi&s;&s;ion)
had made the &s;ame Complaint,
ho' they had no rea&s;on given them &s;o to do,
had had le&s;s to &s;ay; But of all <HI>Scots-men</HI>
$ <HI>O.</HI> had the lea&s;t rea&s;on to quarrel this:
For him (who&s;e Talent may ly in pa&s;&s;ing
a &s;mutty Je&s;t, &s;inging a Bawdy Song, or
puning a little profainly on <HI>Religion,</HI> or &s;o)
to take this &s;o very highly, I think very
&s;urpri&s;ing: I a&s;&s;ure him if I mu&s;t flatter, the&s;e
are not the Endowments I mean to bedawb.
I ow Dr. <HI>Pitcairn</HI> all the Acknowledgments
in the World, for if ever I be able to do any
thing in <HI>Medicine,</HI> it was by him the Foun|dations
were laid, and by his incouragment
<PB REF="10">
and Conver&s;ation I profited more, than by
that of all Mankind's be&s;ides: But I neither
$ow him nor any body el&s;e, Obligations of any
other Nature, which I am not able to repay
in their own Coin: And Time will di&s;cover,
whether he has laid out his Civilities on <HI>C.
O.</HI> (who ows him as much as one Man can
$ow Another) or me to be&s;t Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>C. O</HI> complains he is not allou'd the &s;ame
Liberty of <HI>Philo&s;ophi&s;ing</HI> that others take;
But realy I think, they are his be&s;t Friends
who hold his Hands fa&s;te&s;t: Edg'd Tools ought
to be kept from <HI>Children</HI> and <HI>Mad-men;</HI>
and <HI>C. O.</HI> &s;hou'd no more be &s;uffered to u&s;e
Pen, and Ink, than to Swallow <HI>Ratsbane</HI>
or <HI>Hemlock;</HI> for the one will no more infal|libly
take away his Life, than the other will
ruin his Reputation, which mo&s;t prefer to
Life it &s;elf. I have &s;ufficiently di&s;covered in
the <HI>New Theory of Fevers</HI> how ridiculou&s;ly
he has blundred on that Head; And I appeal
to any one who pretends to under&s;tand the
Matter (even not excepting him&s;elf) after
they have con&s;idered the following Sheets,
whether he has &s;aid any thing to the Pur|po&s;e
in his late Performances. <HI>C. O.</HI> might
have &s;toln through this &s;inful World with a
Reputation Unque&s;tion'd, becau&s;e never en|quir'd
into, had it not been for Writing; he
<PB REF="11">
might have liv'd unthought of and unhear'd
of dy'd, had it not been for the Pre&s;s: It is
true, he had plum'd him&s;elf with Foreign
Feathers; He had made a Bu&s;tle and an ado;
Spoke things he did not under&s;tand, and pre|tended
to what he did not know; But that
was only in a Corner or among his Tran&s;lators,
who took things on Tru&s;t; or if he mi&s;took
his Man, People were well natur'd, and did
not much incline to <HI>Knight-errantry;</HI> They
thought it wi&s;er to flatter Fools than fight
them, and they pretended no <HI>Call</HI> to humble
Pretending <HI>Quacks</HI> or di&s;poil Vain <HI>Jack-daws:</HI>
But when he once dar'd to attack his Superi|ors,
he &s;ees what is come on't; But now his
Hand is in, I'd advi&s;e him to &s;crible on,
<Q>He that is down can fall no lower.</Q></P>
<P>He values him&s;elf mightily, that the Lan|guage
of his fir&s;t <HI>Volume</HI> was &s;u&s;pected to be
a <HI>Friend's</HI> of his, whom he takes Occa&s;ion
mo&s;t invidou&s;ly to bedawb, with a Load of
fal&s;e Paint; And how he hugs him&s;elf in this
Su&s;picion, as he calls it! But I am &s;trangly
&s;urpri&s;ed, he &s;hould have &s;hown him&s;elf &s;o
little acquainted with Mankind, as to ima|gin
the <HI>Philologi&s;t</HI> wou'd let &s;uch a Heap of
Fine Words pa&s;s under another's Name; He
had too much Vanity$ and too little Sincerity
for that; Be&s;ides, did he not &s;ee that the
<PB REF="12">
Texture of the Whole betray'd too much of
the <HI>Pedant,</HI> and &s;mell'd too rank of the <HI>Birch,</HI>
not to di&s;cover the <HI>Interpreter,</HI> the <HI>Purpu|reus
late qui &s;plendeat unus &amp; alter, a&s;&s;ui|tur
pannus,</HI> wou'd have infallibly directed us&punc;
The Seams are too cour&s;e, and the Tacking$
of the&s;e Glittering Raggs too little artfull
not to have fixt before our Eyes that Man
of <HI>Meer Memory:</HI> It is true, the <HI>Author</HI> and
his <HI>Tran&s;lator</HI> are &s;o very alike (which is
generaly the Foundation of Friend&s;hip) that
it might have been &s;u&s;pected, they wou'd have
keept one anothers Secrets; But I can al|ways
lay an Ods on <HI>Natur's</HI> Side; The <HI>Phi|lologi&s;t</HI>
cou'd not bear it, for all their Re&s;em|blance,
in the Vanity of their Tempers, the
In&s;olence of their Behaviour, and their Ingra|titude
to their be&s;t Friends; Out it wou'd
what Part each club'd toward the Production
of the <HI>Brat.</HI> The <HI>Tran&s;lators Character</HI> and
<HI>Legend</HI> is too well known, to be here in&s;i&s;t|ed
on.</P>
<Q><L>(<HI>I' th' mo&s;t &s;incere Advice he ever gave,</HI></L>
<L><HI>He had a Grudging &s;till to be a knave</HI>)</L></Q>
<P>And he is too far below the Dignity both
of <HI>Ver&s;e</HI> and <HI>Pro&s;e,</HI> to merit any further
Notice: I &s;hall di&s;mi&s;s him with this Ad|vice
<HI>viz.</HI> That he continue to encourage the
Ab&s;ence of his <HI>Pupils,</HI> that by their <HI>Mulcts</HI>
<PB REF="13">
he may have the Heart to purcha&s;e a <HI>Faber</HI> (the
Stock whereby he drives his Critical Trade)
of his own, and be able to drink <HI>Genever</HI> at
Home, and not meddle with things without
his Sphere and beyond the reach of his Ca|pacity.
<HI>C. O.</HI> has done Abundance of Hon|our
to our Conutry in pawming upon the
World his <HI>Tran&s;lator,</HI> as our Able&s;t Judge
in both the Learn'd Languages: If he be our
be&s;t <HI>Critick,</HI> and the <HI>Tran&s;lation</HI> the be&s;t E|vidence
of his Abilities, I &s;hall &s;ay no more,
but that we are in a very hopeful Way.</P>
<P>In Fine, All I wou'd beg of 'em both, is,
that if I mu&s;t have an An&s;wer to the&s;e <HI>Remarks,</HI>
they wou'd not be ra&s;h, but before they com|mit
them&s;elves to the wide World again,
they wou'd con&s;ult &s;ome Hone&s;t Friend,
(if any &s;uch they have) who at lea&s;t has

<HEAD>REMARKS
Upon Two Pamphlets, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<P>THE main objections made by <HI>C. O.</HI> a|gain&s;t
<HI>A. P's. Di&s;&s;ertations</HI> are tho&s;e
two, 1. That they are no ways u&s;eful

&s;toln from others namely from <HI>Borelli</HI> and
<HI>Bellini.</HI></P>
<P>As to the fir&s;t, I'd gladly know, who told
<HI>C. O.</HI> that <HI>A. P's.</HI> only de&s;ign in writing

<HI>practice</HI> of <HI>Medicine:</HI> If there be other u&s;es
and that very good ones too, of the&s;e his,
<HI>Works,</HI> it can not be &s;aid, that he has laid
out his pains to no purpo&s;e. Wherefore ab|&s;tracting
at pre&s;ent from the advantages to
be reap'd thence$ to the <HI>practice</HI> of <HI>Medi|cine,</HI>
I will tell him two very good u&s;es of
<HI>A. P</HI>'s. <HI>Di&s;&s;ertations.</HI> 1. They are a genu|ine
explication, of &s;ome of the noble&s;t and
lea&s;t accounted for <HI>appearances</HI> of <HI>Nature;</HI>
and on this &s;core <HI>A. P.</HI> comes into &s;hare in

the gratitude and regard of all hone&s;t and in|genious
men, with Mr. <HI>Newton,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hu|gens,
Borelli</HI> and <HI>Bellini,</HI> and many others,
who have labour'd to in&s;truct our minds, and
explain the wonders of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Art.</HI></P>
<P>2. The&s;e <HI>Di&s;&s;ertations,</HI> with tho&s;e of the
like nature, &s;erve to demon&s;trat the <HI>Infinit
wi&s;dom</HI> of the <HI>CONTRIVER</HI> of the <HI>Univer&s;e,</HI>
of which the animal body is the noble&s;t part;
That <HI>GOD ALMIGHTY</HI> has adju&s;ted the
whole <HI>Fabrick</HI> by weight and mea&s;ure; that
the &s;ame <HI>uniformity</HI> and <HI>&s;implicity,</HI> &s;hine
through all his <HI>works</HI> of <HI>wonder;</HI> that the
&s;ame laws of <HI>Mechani&s;m</HI> are ob&s;erved in the

However his <HI>&s;ingular ta&s;te</HI> will be no rule to

that &s;uch di&s;coveries are u&s;ele&s;s towards &s;uch

<HI>Caeteris paribus,</HI> a <HI>Mathematician</HI> who

con&s;equently can accomodat his art to all
particular emergencies, wou'd not make a

like a Machine, as he is acted by Powers un|known

not what to do: Or whether <HI>Captain Halley's</HI>
conduct of a Ship to the <HI>Ea&s;t</HI> or <HI>We&s;t Indies,</HI>
were not more to be tru&s;ted to, than that of
the <HI>Ma&s;ters</HI> of &s;ome little Frigat, who ne|ver
read a Book but his Sea mans Almanack.
If <HI>C. O</HI>'s advice were to be taken, he wou'd
give it in favours of the la&s;t, for more rea|&s;ons

nor Fal&s;ehood, can either promote or hinder
the Emprovement of <HI>Navigation.</HI> And that
this is not <HI>Maliciou&s;ly</HI> &s;aid, I offer my &s;elf
to defend again&s;t him, that the <HI>Tychonick

providing he take no a&s;&s;i&s;tance but from his

(for if he under&s;tand the whole <HI>Sy&s;teme</HI> of

For every one be&s;ides him&s;elf knows, that a

not to the cure of the di&s;ea&s;es of the Head,
whether the under Jaw-bone move the upper
being fixt, or the upper Jaw-bone move the
under being fixt. Neither indeed does it,
nor do any &s;uch remote <HI>appearances</HI> influence
particular ones. But as in <HI>Navigation,</HI> (to
keep near his <HI>Similitude</HI>) from the precepts
of <HI>Geometers,</HI> a <HI>Tar</HI> may make an <HI>ob&s;erva|tion,</HI>
and go by the help thereof to his tables,
to bring out the Numbers for his <HI>Latitude</HI>
in general ca&s;es; But if a particular emergen|cy
which is not included in his Rules, (And
every one knows that &s;uch dayly occur, not
can precepts reach all particular ca&s;es)
&s;hould happen, he is at his wits end, and
can go no farther; Whereas a <HI>Mathematici|an,</HI>

Difference, as to the Practice of all Kinds,

Ca&s;es, much after the &s;ame Manner <HI>A. P.</HI>

others; When a new Di&s;ea&s;e ari&s;es$ or an old

(and we know all the&s;e dayly fall out) one
Difference (there are a million of others as

or (which is the &s;ame as &s;hall be afterward

5. The true Rea&s;on, why we do not at pre|&s;ent
reap all the Advantages in Practice from
<HI>Mechanick Theories,</HI> which they are capable

Performances of the&s;e three or four learned

the&s;e come to pa&s;s, and the mutual Depen|dence

clear Light, we cannot expect to have a per|fect
Practice: But notwith&s;tanding of this,
He is no le&s;s to be e&s;teem'd a Promoter of

or <HI>Probleme</HI> in either of the&s;e Parts, than he
is to be accounted an Improver of the <HI>Ma|thematicks,</HI>

any Theoreme or Probleme in any of its &s;e|veral
Branches. And</P>
<P>6. La&s;tly, &s;ince every one who practi&s;es
Medicine, founds his Practice upon &s;ome
one Theory or other, (unle&s;s it be <HI>C. O.</HI>

practi&s;es by a certain demon&s;trable <HI>Theory,</HI>
be not to be e&s;teem'd a truer Phy&s;ician, than
one who practi&s;es by a fal&s;e Precarious and
Contradictory one; Or (&s;eeing a Fal&s;e The|ory
is wor&s;e and more Prejudicial to Pra|ctice

be not to be tru&s;ted too rather than a
meer Quack. <HI>C. O.</HI> is of this la&s;t Opinion, and
may he Eternally per&s;i&s;t in it: which is all

that the <HI>Mathematicks</HI> take it very ill at his

<HI>Tran&s;lators,</HI> and employ'd by the <HI>Ladies</HI> of

his &s;econd Objection; In Order to which it
will not be am$&s;s to premi&s;e this General
An&s;wer to all his <HI>Cavills</HI> of this kind <HI>viz</HI> that
allowing <HI>A. P,</HI> had taken any Hints from
<HI>Borelli</HI> or <HI>Bellini,</HI> and had improv'd them to
good Purpo&s;e as he has done, and had &s;et
the whole Affair in a clearer <HI>Light,</HI> is he not
to be commended for &s;o doing? Or wou'd
any thing except <HI>C. O.</HI> have blam'd him?
All who ha$e read <HI>Borelli</HI> and <HI>Bellini's</HI>
Works carefully, can't but &s;ee that the <HI>Lat|ter</HI>
has borrow d more from the <HI>Former,</HI> than
<HI>A. P.</HI> has done from <HI>either:</HI> And &s;ure I am,
none ever twitted that <HI>Great Man</HI> with this,
except they have been of <HI>C. O's. Kidney.</HI> I
cou'd adduce many In&s;tances in men of the
greate&s;t and faire&s;t Characters among the
<HI>Learned,</HI> who might have taken Hints from
<PB N="18" REF="31">
one another; But no Man of Ingenuity ever
condemn'd them for &s;o doing, if they either
extended the borrow'd Notion, or apply'd it
to Purpo&s;es unthought of by him who fir&s;t
advanc d it, or la&s;tly gave it a Finer Turn
and &s;et it in a Better Light: And if <HI>A. P.</HI> has
taken any thing from the&s;e two <HI>Fathers</HI> of
the <HI>Mechanical Medicine,</HI> all hone&s;t men
who under&s;tand their &s;everal Performances,
will allow that it his lo&s;t nothing in his

who unite the &s;cattered Parts of a Sci|ence,
&amp; make the whole Affair of a Piece, &amp;
&s;how the Connexion of one Part upon ano|ther,
than tho&s;e who were the Inventors of
the &s;everal Branches. But be&s;ides, Is it not
very ordinary to &s;ee tho&s;e who rea&s;on ju&s;tly
from different <HI>Methods,</HI> fall into the &s;ame
Conclu&s;ions, without borrowing the lea&s;t
Hint from one another or knowing of one
anothers De&s;igns? This happens dayly in
tho&s;e Matters to which <HI>Mathematicks</HI> can be
apply'd: And tho' the fir&s;t <HI>Di&s;coverer</HI> mu&s;t
be reckon'd the <HI>Publick Inventer,</HI> yet the &s;e|cond
may ju&s;tly pretend to a Share in the
<HI>Glory,</HI> if he is known to have brought it out
of his own <HI>Fond.</HI> I heartily wi&s;h there were
many who &s;tole at <HI>A. P</HI>'s. Rate, I'm &s;ure
<HI>Medicine</HI> in a Short Time wou'd make another
<PB N="19" REF="32">
Appearance than it now does. But as to the
Particulars objected,</P>
<P>I. The plain meaning of that Place in <HI>A.
P</HI>'s. <HI>Di&s;&s;ertations</HI> viz. <HI>Po&s;th$c facilius pote|rimus
dijudicare.</HI> &amp;c. who&s;e my&s;tery <HI>C. O.</HI>
cou'd not unfold, is briefly this. Says <HI>A. P.</HI>
Now that we know <HI>Secretions</HI> to be perform'd
after &s;o plain and intelligible a Manner, the
Half of our Bu&s;ine&s;s is done; for there re|mains
nothing to be enquir'd into, but to
find <HI>Medicines,</HI> not of a numerous and com|plicated
Train of Qualities, as was formerly
believ'd, but of a few &s;imple ones, which
may an&s;wer to the&s;e Motions whereby the
re&s;pective <HI>Secretions</HI> are perform'd. Thus
he not only &s;horrens the Study of Medicine,
but points at the true <HI>Enquires:</HI> And that
this is his Meaning, is evident from what
follows <HI>viz. Neq; enim nihil erit artis
longae cultori ingenuo ad tot perpetuos com|pilatores
damnari.</HI> So that <HI>C. O</HI>'s. Quaint
<HI>Conundrum</HI> about <HI>D$ureticks</HI> and <HI>Di$phore|ticks</HI>
is intirely his own, and much good may
it do him.</P>
<P>II. There are &s;o many <HI>Ingenious</HI> and even
new <HI>Theorems</HI> in this fir&s;t <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation</HI> of <HI>A.
P</HI>'s. that none but <HI>C. O.</HI> wou'd pretend to un|der&s;tand
and de&s;pi&s;e 'em at the &s;ame Time:
He has determin'd the True Figure of the
<PB N="20" REF="33">
<HI>Secretory Canals</HI> from diver&s;every important
Con&s;iderations, and demon&s;trated the <HI>Conti|nuity</HI>
of the <HI>Arteries</HI> with the <HI>Veins,</HI> which
are the two Fundamental <HI>Theo$ems</HI> upon
which all the &s;ound Rea&s;oning about <HI>Animal
aeconomy</HI> is builded. But &s;ays <HI>C. O. Bellini</HI>
hinted this <HI>Continuity</HI> before him; And for
Proof of this he adduces a part of the 70
Page of his book <HI>De Urinis &amp; Pul&s;ibus.</HI>
There cannot be brought a plainer Evidence
of <HI>C. O</HI>'s. profound Ignorance in the&s;e Mat|ters,
for it is clear not only from that place
but from the whole Di&s;cour&s;e, that <HI>Bellini</HI>
thought only there cou'd be no <HI>Parenchima|tous</HI>
Separation betwixt the <HI>Evane&s;cent Ar|teries</HI>
and <HI>Veins,</HI> as was commonly believ'd,
and that therefore they behoov'd to be <HI>Con|tiguous</HI>
or inferred by <HI>Ana&s;tomo&s;es</HI> into one
another. But this is far from being <HI>A. P</HI>'s.
Doctrine on this Head, for he proves that they
are not only <HI>Contiguous</HI> but <HI>Continuous</HI> to
one another, and that the very &s;ame <HI>Artery
returning</HI> becomes the <HI>Vein;</HI> And indeed
without this the Matter had been intirely
Lame, if you once &s;uppo&s;e the <HI>Arteries</HI> and
<HI>Veins</HI> different, tho not disjoyn'd, you make
an End of the Circulation: It mu&s;t be the
<HI>Continuity</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Ela&s;tick Fibres</HI> that
mu&s;t propagate the Impul&s;e communicated
<PB N="21" REF="34">
to the Blood. But the&s;e were things too hard
for <HI>C. O.</HI> to conceive. Be&s;ides all the&s;e,
allowing <HI>Bellini</HI> had given the Hint of the
thing, <HI>C. O.</HI> dares not &s;ay he has prov'd it,
and no body was oblig'd to believe it upon
his bare A&s;&s;ertion. Nothing can or ought to
be admitted into the Number of known
Truths till it be publickly demon&s;trated; and
it is a fault in the Improvers of this or any o|ther
Science, to advance any new thing with|out
it's <HI>Demon&s;tration;</HI> and he who &s;upplies
this does &s;ometimes better Service to the
Publick, than the fir&s;t Inventer.</P>
<P>III. <HI>C. O.</HI> In his Remarks upon <HI>A. P's</HI> Se|cond
<HI>Di&s;&s;ertation,</HI> alledges he has &s;tolen the
Materials thereof from <HI>Borelli.</HI> If <HI>C. O.</HI> had
nam'd any other Author what&s;oever at a
Venture, he cou'd not have been farther mi|&s;taken
than in quoting <HI>Borelli,</HI> for <HI>A. P</HI>'s. In|&s;tructer
on this Head: <HI>Borelli's</HI> Opinion (as
will be evident to any one who reads more of
his Works than their <HI>Index</HI>) about the Man|ner
and u&s;e of Re&s;piration is plainly thus.
He thought that in the &s;trugle of Birth, the
<HI>Faetus</HI> wou'd nece&s;&s;arly dilate the Cavity of
the Brea&s;t, whereby the Air wou'd ru&s;h in
to fill the <HI>Ve&s;icles</HI> of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> which be|ing
compre&s;&s;ed by the falling down of the
Sides of the <HI>Abdomen,</HI> wou'd force the Blood
<PB N="22" REF="35">
through the Lungs into the left <HI>Ventricle</HI> of
the Heart; In doing which &s;ome of the <HI>O|&s;cillatory</HI>
Air wou'd be thru&s;t through the
Sides of the <HI>Ve&s;icles</HI> of the <HI>Lungs,</HI> and the
Sides of the <HI>Arteries</HI> into the Blood: This
la&s;t was <HI>Bo$elli's</HI> peculiar and darling Opini|on,
the re&s;t being common to every one who
&s;poke of the&s;e things, &s;ince the Structure of
the <HI>Lungs</HI> and the Properties of the Air
were di&s;covered. Now <HI>C. O.</HI> out of the
Depth of <HI>Penetration,</HI> did imagine that this
was <HI>A P</HI>'s Opinion, but &s;uch things will
happen one who under&s;tands neither of their
Opinions: For 1. <HI>Borelli</HI> thought the Motion
of the Blood through the <HI>Lungs,</HI> was, when
they were Flaccid and empty of Air, as ap|pears
from the Place quoted by <HI>C. O. Prop.</HI>
117. <HI>Po&s;tea coincidentibus</HI> &amp;c. Which is
both fal&s;e and directly contrary to <HI>A. P's</HI> Opi|nion
on this head. 2. <HI>Borelli</HI> knew nothing
of the true Figure of the <HI>Ve&s;icles</HI> of the <HI>Lungs</HI>
when flaccid, nor when inflated, which <HI>A.
P.</HI> has hinted, and which may be <HI>Geometri|cally</HI>
determin'd after the &s;ame manner and
from the &s;ame Principles <HI>John Bernoulli</HI> de|termin'd
the Figure of the inflated <HI>Ve&s;icles</HI> of
the <HI>Mu&s;cular Fibres:</HI> And the knowledge
of the&s;e Figures do mightily conduce to form
a right Notion and explain the True Nature
<PB N="23" REF="36">
of this <HI>Animal Function.</HI> 3. <HI>Borelli</HI> knew
nothing of the True Situation of the&s;e <HI>Ve&s;icles</HI>
in re&s;pect of the <HI>Pulmonary Trunk</HI> viz. That
they were at <HI>Oblique Angles</HI> with the Inferi|or,
and con&s;equently at <HI>obtu&s;e Angles</HI> with
the Superior part thereof when flaccid, but
that upon an Inflation, the <HI>oblique Angles</HI>
were made <HI>le&s;s oblique,</HI> and con&s;equently the
<HI>obtu&s;e</HI> ones <HI>le&s;s obtu&s;e;</HI> And that all the&s;e
mu&s;t happen from the <HI>Ela&s;ticity</HI> and uniform
<HI>Pre&s;&s;ure</HI> of the inflating Air: Now the de|termina$ion
of the&s;e two <HI>viz.</HI> The Figures
and Situation of the&s;e Ve&s;icles when flaccid
&amp; when inflated are the Hinges upon which
the <HI>Mechanicall</HI> Explica$ion of this Operati|on
can move, without which (as it happens
in all the other different Accounts of this
Matter) all is Contradiction and Non&s;en&s;e
And the&s;e are the two Heads which mainly
di&s;tingui&s;h <HI>A. P</HI>'s. Doctrine in this affair,
not only from <HI>Borelli</HI>'s but from that of all
others. 4. La&s;tly, <HI>Borelli</HI> was clearly mi|&s;taken
in the u&s;e of this Function, imagining
an <HI>o&s;ciliatory</HI> Fluid was thereby thrown into
the Blood, which he thought the principle
of Life and Motion; But this Doctrine is not
only fal&s;e, but were it true, it wou'd not
&s;erve his purpo&s;e. And now &s;ince I have
thus clearly and di&s;tinctly laid the whole
<PB N="24" REF="37">
matter before <HI>C O.</HI> I wou'd de&s;ire him to
a&s;&s;ign the A&s;&s;ertion I have alledged which he
thinks fal&s;e&mdash;Or if he wou'd take a little
good Advice from <HI>&s;uch a Fellow a$ I am,</HI> I'd
coun&s;el him to let the Matter intirely alone;
For notwith&s;tanding the Performances of the&s;e
Learned Men this Way, there is &s;omething
in the <HI>Mechanical</HI> Explication of Re&s;p$ration
which he can neither find out before it be ex|plain'd,
nor under&s;tand it when demon&s;trated.</P>
<P>IV. <HI>C. O.</HI> Goes on next to <HI>A. P</HI>'s <HI>Di&s;&s;er|tation</HI>
about <HI>Dige&s;tion,</HI> and out of his Aboun|dant
Comm$&s;eration to his Fellow Reader,
he will needs give an Ab&s;tract of <HI>A. P</HI>'s, Di&s;|cour&s;e;
In Order to which he tran&s;cribes
<HI>Borelli's</HI> Opinion about <HI>Nutrition,</HI> and this
he calls the Sum of <HI>A. P</HI>'s. Doctrine about
<HI>Dige&s;tion,</HI> and appeals to his Reader, yea to
<HI>A. P.</HI> him&s;elf with as great an a&s;&s;urance, as
if he were a&s;&s;erting an <HI>Eternal Truth.</HI></P>
<P>However <HI>Good Charles Oliphant</HI> this will
pa&s;s upon no Body but your Learned <HI>Inter|preters;</HI>
For notwi$h&s;tanding your Confident
Appeal, I mantain that <HI>A. P</HI>'s. Doctrine both
about Digection and Nutrition is different
from <HI>Borelli</HI>'s, and over and above that, <HI>Bo|relli</HI>'s
Opinions in the&s;e Matters are ab&s;olute|ly
fal&s;e. As to the fir&s;t it is evident that
<HI>Borelli</HI> thought <HI>Dige&s;tion</HI> was mainly per|form'd
<PB N="25" REF="38">
by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;ome di&s;&s;olving
<HI>Men&s;truum</HI> or <HI>Ferment</HI> Prop 199. 2<HI>d.</HI> Part.
<HI>Po&s;tquam cibi contriti &amp; macerati fuerunt
&s;ucco fermentitio &s;tom$chi</HI> &amp;c. Prop. 192.
Speaking of the Manner of the Dige&s;tion of
Birds, <HI>Excipiunt ambientem arenam, quam
&s;ucco fermentitio quo abundant di&s;&s;olvere po&s;|&s;unt,
ut aquae corro&s;iva duri&s;&s;imos &s;ilices &amp; me|talla.</HI>
Prop. 189. <HI>Haec animalia ferment o quo|dam
validi&s;&s;imo carnes &amp; o&s;&s;a con&s;umunt,
non &s;ecus ac aquae corro&s;ivae metalla corrodunt
ac di&s;&s;olvunt.</HI> It is true, from the Firmne&s;s,
Weight and <HI>Mu&s;cular</HI> Fibres of the <HI>Gizards</HI>
of Birds re&s;embling that of the <HI>Heart,</HI> he
thought they might act as other <HI>Mu&s;cles;</HI>
But it is evident from the Places cited, and
many others I cou'd adduce, that he thought
the great Bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Dige&s;tion</HI> was performed
by a <HI>Ferment.</HI> Now this is &s;o far from being
<HI>A.</HI> P's. Doctrine, that he has &s;pent one
Half of that Di&s;cour&s;e to confute it, and has
&s;hown that <HI>Dige&s;tion</HI> is perform'd after a
Manner &s;utable to the re&s;t of the <HI>Animal
Functions.</HI> And as to the Manner of <HI>Nu|trition</HI>
which <HI>Borelli</HI> a&s;&s;igns in the Place cited
by <HI>C. O.</HI> it is ab&s;olutly fal&s;e, depending (as
him&s;elf &s;ays) upon the <HI>Nece&s;&s;itas configu|rationis
cribro&s;ae,</HI> and the Exploded Notion
of <HI>S$milar Parts:</HI> This <HI>configuratio cribro&s;a
<PB N="26" REF="39">
A.</HI> P. has con&s;uted in &s;everal of his Di&s;|cour&s;es,
and the Notion of <HI>Similar Parts</HI> is
ab&s;olutly contradictory to the true Nature
of <HI>Fluids,</HI> and the Nece&s;&s;ity of <HI>Conical</HI> o$
<HI>Cylindrical</HI> Parts.</P>
<P>Is it not a little &s;urpri&s;ing to find one a$
this Time a Day, who has the Vanity to
pretend to under&s;tand the <HI>Animal oecono$$</HI>
and the di&s;coveries made therein in this la&s;$
Age, talking at this Rate? and Imagining
this to be a true Explication of <HI>Nutrition!</HI>
Or can there be a more Evident In&s;tance that
<HI>C. O.</HI> under&s;tands only a Few Scrapes which
he has pick'd up here and there, &amp; which he
can not tack together to make 'em look of
a Piece? I do not expect Thanks from him
(for he has publickly declar'd the contrar $
for the Pains I am about to take to inform
him: However I'll take this Occa&s;ion to ex|plain
the true Manner of <HI>Nutrition</HI> founded
on the <HI>Circulation</HI> of the Blood and the Na|ture
of <HI>Secretion,</HI> and conform to A. P's
Doctrine on this Head.</P>
<P>Seing then it is certain that the <HI>Arteries</HI>
are <HI>continuous</HI> to the <HI>Veins,</HI> and &s;eing <HI>Secre|tion</HI>
is perform'd by the Compo&s;ition of two
Motions <HI>viz.</HI> a <HI>direct</HI> and a <HI>tran&s;ver&s;e</HI> one,
and that the Difference of the Secern'd Fluids
depends upon the <HI>Diameters</HI> of the <HI>Secretory
<PB N="27" REF="40">
C$$als,</HI> and the <HI>Velocity</HI> of the Fluid with
which it arrives at their Orifices, And la&s;tly,
&s;eing <HI>Nutrition</HI> is but the <HI>Secretion</HI> of
&s;ome Portion of the <HI>Arterial</HI> Fluid, to re|pair
the <HI>Expen&s;es</HI> of <HI>Living,</HI> It follows,
that not the <HI>Similarity</HI> of Parts but the Orifi|ces
of the <HI>Secretories</HI> of the Nouri&s;hing
Fluid, and the re&s;pective <HI>Velocity</HI> with which
it arrives at the&s;e Orifices, is that which de|termins
this Fluid to &s;uch and &s;uch Places,
and that it is keep'd there by the Force of
the &s;ucceeding Fluid: Moreover, &s;eing even
the Canals them&s;elves do encrea&s;e in Bulk,
may decay and be impair'd, every a&s;&s;ignable
Part of the Canals mu&s;t be the Terminati|on
of &s;ome <HI>Secretory</HI> Conduit, carrying a
Fluid fit to encrea&s;e their Dimen&s;ions or re|pair
their Lo&s;&s;es; And the&s;e <HI>Secretory</HI> Canals
again mu&s;t have others to encrea&s;e their Bulk
or repair their Lo&s;&s;es, and &s;o on <HI>in Infini|tum.</HI></P>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>COROLLARY.</HEAD>
<P>FROM this Doctrine and &s;everal other
Topicks I can adduce (as particular|ly
from the whole Bu&s;ine&s;s of Sen&s;ati|on)
it follows that ev'ry natural <HI>Machine
i. e.</HI> all <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vegetables</HI> what&s;oever
<PB N="28" REF="41">
(which by the by is the <HI>Specifick</HI> Difference
betwixt the Works of <HI>Nature</HI> and <HI>Art</HI>) con|&s;i&s;t
of <HI>Organs</HI> in Number actualy <HI>infinite,</HI>
and con&s;equently require <HI>infinite</HI> Wi&s;dom
and Power in their Contriver and Maker;
And therefore, if there be <HI>Animals</HI> and <HI>Vege|tables</HI>
which have not produc'd them&s;elves,
there mu&s;t of Nece&s;&s;ity be a GOD. This
is one Argument for the Exi&s;tence of the
<HI>Deity,</HI> which <HI>C. O.</HI> will not be able ea&s;ily
to di&s;prove: Perhaps the Doctrine may look
a little <HI>odd and new</HI> to him, but this is not
the only Way I cou'd &s;urpri&s;e him, if I had
Lei&s;ure and Inclination to in&s;truct him.</P>
<P>C. O. is very hard here upon A. P. for
not allowing Liquids any place in the &s;olu|tion
of this <HI>Probleme</HI> about the manner of
<HI>Dige&s;tion;</HI> This is not unlike the re&s;t of <HI>C.
O</HI>'s Objections. <HI>A.</HI> P. was to &s;how the internal
Forces whereby the Food was reduced to the
Fitte&s;t Form for recruiting the Blood, and
<HI>C. O.</HI> will very wi&s;ely have him take in Ex|ternal
A&s;&s;i&s;tents into the Con&s;ideration; In
my Humble Opinion this had been begging$
the Que&s;tion, &amp; he might have as well taken
in the <HI>Boiling</HI> and <HI>Bakeing,</HI> the <HI>Roa&s;ting</HI> and
<HI>Frying</HI> and the other Preparations of the
<HI>Kitchin,</HI> to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the <HI>Solution</HI> of this
<HI>Probleme,</HI> as that of <HI>Drinking:</HI> His Bu&s;ine&s;s
<PB N="29" REF="42">
was only to examin, if the Force of the <HI>Sto|mach</HI>
and the other concurring <HI>Mu&s;cles</HI> was
&s;ufficient to reduce a Solid of a Mo$erat$

For if it was once demon&s;trated that
the <HI>Stomach</HI> cou'd di&s;&s;olve Food without the
Concurrence of Liquors, even <HI>C. O.</HI> cou'd
infer it cou'd do it more ea&s;ily with them.

for the <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> of a <HI>Deity,</HI> from the Im|po&s;&s;ibility
of the <HI>Mechanical</HI> Production of
<HI>Animals,</HI> and alledges the proof is not Good,
becau&s;e he Imagins A. P. infers from it only,
that the <HI>Origine</HI> of the <HI>Faetus</HI> is derived from
<PB N="32" REF="45">
the <HI>M$le</HI> and not from the <HI>Female:</HI> I have
given Several In&s;tances already, how little
C. O. is able to di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt things;
The Rea&s;on of which is, that he is not capable
of entring into the Inward Nature of the
Matters he &s;peaks about: Like a true <HI>Quack</HI>
he keeps you at a great di&s;tance from the
point, defends him&s;elf with long <HI>Weapons,</HI>
and endeavours to &s;ecure from Blundering, by
General Terms. He thought it a little in|convenient
to go directly to Work, and fall
a combating Arguments for the <HI>Exi&s;tence</HI> of
a <HI>Deity,</HI> and therefore he takes a con&s;equence
to A. P's <HI>Demon&s;tration,</HI> which he thinks
Fal&s;e, and wou'd have his Reader conclude
the <HI>Propo&s;ition</HI> Fal&s;e; upon the account of
the Imaginary Fal&s;ehood of the <HI>Corollary.</HI>
But I tell you <HI>Charles Oliphant,</HI> and look to't;
If an <HI>Animal</HI> can not be produc'd <HI>Mechani|cally,</HI>
there mu&s;t be a <HI>Supreme Being</HI> who
did &s;ome Time or other creat the &s;ame, and
that whither the Origine of the <HI>Faetus</HI> be de|riv'd
from the <HI>Male</HI> or from the <HI>Female.</HI> It
is true, from the Con&s;ideration that the
Works of <HI>Creation</HI> are now ceas'd, and that
an Animal cou'd be produc'd by no Laws
of <HI>Mechani&s;m,</HI> and &s;ome other <HI>Appearan|ces</HI>
of <HI>Nature</HI> that can no other ways be ac|counted
for, <HI>A. P.</HI> might infer that the
<PB N="33" REF="46">
Origin of the <HI>Faetus</HI> proceeded rather from
the <HI>Male</HI> than the <HI>Female;</HI> But this Inference
does noways influence the <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> of
the <HI>Exi&s;tenoe</HI> of a <HI>Deity</HI> from the <HI>Immecha|nical</HI>
Production of <HI>Animals:</HI> For let that
be how it will, Yet this is true and nece&s;&s;ar|ly
follows from his Rea&s;oning. Ay, but &s;ays
<HI>C. O.</HI> very learn'dly, the Seeds of <HI>Plants</HI> are
certainly little <HI>Plants,</HI> and they can be pro|duc'd
<HI>Mechanically</HI> no more, than the mo&s;t
perfect Animal; And therefore the <HI>Herb|Woman</HI>
and her <HI>Salladine</HI> are of the &s;ame o|riginal:
I grant it, and where is the Hazard?
Every Individual Animal (as I have afore|&s;aid)
even the lea&s;t <HI>In&s;ect</HI> and <HI>Plant</HI> requires
to its Production infinite Power and Wi&s;|dom,
and the mo&s;t perfect Creature can re|quire
no more.</P>
<P>I cou'd here &s;how the Impo&s;&s;ibility of the
<HI>Mechanical</HI> Production of <HI>Animals,</HI> from &s;e|veral
other Topicks, be&s;ides that adduc'd by
<HI>A. P.</HI> As likeways (from the nature of ma|terial
Organs; the <HI>Laws</HI> of <HI>Motion</HI> and the
Structure of living Creatures) that there
mu&s;t be &s;omething in the World above the
Power of <HI>Matter;</HI> But the&s;e I refer to a
more glorious Work, than that of expo&s;ing
<HI>C. O</HI>'s Frailties: No hone&s;t Man wou'd lay

The more they are, the better; For &s;ome are

<P>But &s;ays <HI>C. O. Malbranch</HI> and <HI>Bellini</HI> have
both of 'em <HI>Demon&s;trated</HI> the <HI>Immechanical</HI>
Production of <HI>Animals.</HI> It is very hard C.
<HI>O.</HI> &s;hou'd take the Liberty of &s;aying what
he plea&s;es without any <HI>Avoucher, Malbranch</HI>
has barely mention'd the thing, but you can
no more find a <HI>Demon&s;tration</HI> thereof in his
Works, than in <HI>C. O</HI>'s elaborat <HI>Pamphlets:</HI>
And as for <HI>Bellini.</HI> if we may gather his O|pinion
from his writings, it wou'd &s;eem he
were of another Mind; for he endeavours to
account for the <HI>Motion of the Heart,</HI> the
<HI>Circulation</HI> of the <HI>Blood,</HI> and the Forma|tion
of the Principal parts of an <HI>Animal,</HI>
from the <HI>Data</HI> of a <HI>di&s;&s;olving Fluid,</HI> and an
<HI>Ela&s;tick Canal;</HI> which (notwith&s;tanding all
the ingenious things he has &s;aid on that Head)
will no more form a living Creature, than a
Bag full of melting Butter will produce an
<HI>Emperour.</HI> I come now to con&s;ider what he
has to &s;ay again&s;t <HI>A. P</HI>'s a&s;&s;erting the <HI>Ori|gin</HI>
of the <HI>Faetus</HI> to be deriv'd from the Male.</P>
<P>Says <HI>C. O.</HI> the Seed of <HI>Plant-animals</HI> is
not$ deriv'd from a Male, and therefore this
A&s;&s;ertion of <HI>A. P</HI>'s is fal&s;e. There is for

you now. The &s;eed of <HI>Plant-animals</HI> is not
deriv'd from a Male, and Therefore &amp;c. I
&s;hou'd not have taken notice of &s;uch an Ob|jection
as this, but that he repeats it over
again in the <HI>Refutation:</HI> Did ever any one
&s;eriou&s;ly a&s;&s;ert, that there were Di&s;tinctions
of <HI>Sexes</HI> in Plants? Does not ev'ry body know,
if an external Injury, a Wound, an improper
Soil or Climate, a chilling con&s;tant Bla&s;t, a
rotting Fall of Rain, Old Age or &s;ome &s;uch
cau&s;e does not occa&s;ion Battenne&s;s, that ev'|ry
Plant duly cultivated will bear Seed? If
I &s;hou'd &s;ay that evry Plant is a Male, and
the Earth or at lea&s;t a convenient Bed therein,
is the Mother or Female, I &s;hou'd be guilty
of a le&s;s <HI>Soleci&s;m,</HI> than <HI>C. O.</HI> But all &s;uch

to be concluded thence. But, &s;ay <HI>C. O.</HI> Na|ture

the true univer&s;al Uniformity con&s;i&s;ting nei|ther
in that the Origin of the <HI>Faetus</HI> is in the

who hit upon the Ob&s;ervation, and com|municated

<HI>Animalculs</HI> can get to the <HI>Ovary.</HI> But 1. I
wou'd gladly know who told him that they
mu&s;t get thither; <HI>Lewvenhoeck,</HI> who fir&s;t
broach'd this <HI>Here&s;y,</HI> was of Opinion that
the <HI>Ovary</HI> of the Female, as &s;uch, contribu|ted
as little towards the Generation of the
<HI>Faetus,</HI> as the Brea&s;ts and Niples of the Male
did towards their Nutrition. And 2. I &s;hou'd
think that a Living and Moving Animal,
which cou'd turn and wind a thou&s;and dif|ferent
Ways, cou'd as readily get thither, as
<HI>D. O's</HI> Fecundating <HI>Aura,</HI> which is deter|min'd
One Way. But 3. the true An&s;wer
&s;eems to ly in the Infinit Number of the&s;e
<PB N="39" REF="52">
<HI>Animalculs;</HI> There mu&s;t be &s;ome one Place

accommodated with the Nece&s;&s;aries of <HI>Nu|trition:</HI>
So that that Ca&s;e runs thus, If

Next, <HI>C. O.</HI> alledges <HI>Malpighi</HI> had ob&s;erved
the <HI>Rudiments</HI> of an <HI>Animal</HI> in a Wind-egg.
But all I can find in his whole Works, which
can any ways favour him, is in the&s;e Words;
In the &s;econd Page of his Ob&s;ervations <HI>De
formatione pulli,</HI> &s;ays he, <HI>Placebat etiam &s;ub|ventanea
ova lu&s;trando cicatriculam intueri,
quae utplurimum minima erat, &amp; licet vari|am
&s;ortiretur circum&s;criptionem, frequentius

Scheme, which one can make nothing
<PB N="40" REF="53">
of) <HI>prae &s;e ferebat figuram, non longe d$ ce$|tro
globo&s;um condidumque corpus, qua&s;e mote
locabatur quod laceratum nullum pecudiare
corpus exhibeat a &s;e diver&s;um</HI> &amp;c. Thus you
&s;ee how diffidently <HI>Malpighi</HI> &s;peaks of the
Matter. And it is ob&s;ervable. That in his
repeated and amended Ob&s;ervations (which
are the only Ones we ought to tru&s;t to) he
never &s;o much as mentions the Matter. If <HI>C.
O.</HI> can adduce any Quotation more pertinent
to his Purpo&s;e, I de&s;ire him to point the
Page in his Next; for men are not obliged to
read over <HI>Volumes</HI> to di&s;cover his Meaning:
But I am not much affraid he can bring out
of him or any other credible Author, any
thing po&s;itively confirming his Opinion.
Nor indeed can the Matter bear it without a
great deal of Caution: For it is almo&s;t Im|po&s;&s;ible
to be certain, if the Female, who&s;e
egg you examin, has not been (&s;ome &s;hort
time before) troden by the Male! Be&s;ides
that it is hard to manage the <HI>Cicatricula</HI> &s;o
as to be &s;ure not to be deceiv'd. Before <HI>C.

advi&s;e him to read his <HI>po&s;thumus</HI> Works,
where he will find his own <HI>Character</HI> in him,

mu&s;t needs be the Manner of <HI>Generation.</HI> 1.
Suppo&s;ing there have been di&s;covered <HI>Ani|malculs</HI>
in the <HI>Male-Seed,</HI> I wou'd ask <HI>C. O.</HI>
what he thinks to be their U&s;e; Why &s;hou d
Nature have furni&s;h'd it with different Ani|mals,
and not rather with tho&s;e de&s;ign'd to
be the Origin of the <HI>Faetus,</HI> &s;ince the Lat|ter
was as ea&s;ily to be done as the Former?
This looks a little &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly, as if Nature
did not bring about its Effects after the mo&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="55">
plain and &s;imple Manner: If there have been
<HI>Animalculs</HI> di&s;cover'd (as mo&s;t certainly
there have) in all the <HI>Male-Seeds</HI> hitherto
examin'd, then as certainly they have been
de&s;ign'd for the Production of the <HI>Species:</HI>
No other po&s;&s;ible U&s;e of 'em being to be a&s;|&s;igned.
2. It is utterly impo&s;&s;ible to account

being joyn'd by the Backs or Bellies, others
are deficient or aboundant in &s;ome <HI>Organs,</HI>
without this &s;uppo&s;ition. 3. Is it not very

Ev'ry <HI>Animal</HI> whether generated or
not, comprehended in its Loins, all that &s;hall
ever de&s;cend of it.</P>
<P>3. That not only the Organs and Solid
Parts of all the&s;e <HI>Animals</HI> were di&s;tinctly
form'd by the Hand of Almighty God at the
Creation, But that at all Times &s;ince, their
Fluids have mov'd, and their Blood, or that
which is <HI>Analegous</HI> thereunto, has circulated;
Tho' both the&s;e be with &s;ome little Diffe|rence
from what they are in a perfect <HI>Animal;</HI>
In a word, the la&s;t of the Race of <HI>Adam</HI> that
&s;hall be, was actualy included in his Loins,
when <HI>Adam</HI> was created, had his &s;olid parts
there di&s;tinctly form'd, and his <HI>Fluids</HI> con|&s;tantly
moving, and has been ever &s;ince the
<HI>Creation</HI> dayly augmen ing and growing in
Maturity. And there will be no difficulty
for him to conceive this, who under&s;tands
that both above and below any given Quanti|ty,
there may be a&s;&s;ign'd another <HI>&s;imilar</HI> Quan|tity
<PB N="44" REF="57">
in any given <HI>Proportion;</HI> and con&s;equent|ly
that there may be conceiv'd an <HI>Infinit
Number</HI> of <HI>&s;imilar Animalculs</HI> de&s;cending or
le&s;&s;ening from any giv'n Animal, how &s;mall
&s;o ever; And &s;o all the&s;e Infinite Numbers
of <HI>Animalculs</HI> might be lodg'd in the Bigne&s;s
of a Pin's Head. As likewi&s;e that all the&s;e
<HI>Animalculs</HI> Fluids may actually move, tho'
perhaps only with a <HI>Velocity</HI> proportional to
their &s;everal Bulks. This needs no further
Explication.</P>
<P>4. That &s;ome of the Solid Parts of the&s;e
<HI>Animalculs</HI> are as it were folded and wrap'd
up in <HI>Plaits,</HI> and the&s;e Foldings are wrap'd to|gether
by &s;urrounding Membranes, which in
proce&s;s of Time are rent and torn, by the en|crea&s;'d
Force of the Fluid and Augmentation
of the Solid Parts; As is commonly ob&s;erv'd
in the Transformation of all Infects: And
that the <HI>Nervous Fibres</HI> are capable
only of a determin'd Degree of Ten&s;ion,
without lo&s;ing their <HI>Ela&s;tick</HI> Power of
bur&s;ting; which Degree of <HI>Ten&s;ion</HI> an&s;wers
commonly to the Utual Dimen&s;ions and bulk
of the <HI>Species</HI> of the Animal. And this <HI>Pro|po&s;ition</HI>
rightly under&s;tood, will account for
the determin'd Stature which all <HI>Animals</HI>
and <HI>Vegetables</HI> of the &s;ame <HI>Species</HI> commonly
reach; as likeways the Nece&s;&s;ity of Natural
<PB N="45" REF="58">
Death and Declining Age, together with
&s;ome other uncommon Appearances.</P>
<P>5. That the&s;e <HI>Animalculs</HI> are all included
in the Male, till the act of <HI>Copulation;</HI> as be|ing
the Nobler Sex, who&s;e greater Warmth,
brisker Motion of Blood &amp; clo&s;er Texture of

That they encrei&s;e &s;o &s;lowly before
<HI>Copulation</HI> and &s;o quickly after, will be no
Wonder to him, who confiders the &s;low Mo|tion

when perhaps I &s;hall explain mechani|cally
the whole <HI>Animal OEconomy.</HI></P>
<P>VII. Next <HI>C. O.</HI> falls foul of <HI>A. P.</HI> be|cau&s;e
he explains the Effects of <HI>Anodynes</HI>
and the cau&s;e of <HI>Sleepy Di&s;tempers</HI> from the
<HI>Di&s;ten&s;ion</HI> of the &s;mall <HI>Arteries,</HI> and their
Action upon the <HI>Nervous Fibres</HI> of the Brain;
and alledges this Notion is likeways &s;lolen
from <HI>Bellini.</HI> Such a way of talking without
Fear or Shame, wou'd almo&s;t make one lo&s;e
his Temper: <HI>Bellini</HI> indeed has pretty natu|rally
explain'd the Di&s;ea&s;es of the Head,
But he has no where con&s;idered the Manner
of the Operation of particular Medicines. It is
&s;trange to &s;ee one of &s;o high <HI>Preten&s;ions</HI> &s;o
&s;leep in their <HI>Apprehen&s;ion,</HI> as not to be able to
di&s;tingui&s;h betwixt the Cau&s;e and the Effect.
<HI>Bellini,</HI> upon &s;uppo&s;ition the &s;mall <HI>Arteries</HI>
of the Brain were di&s;tended by whatever
Cau&s;e, did &s;how what Effects wou'd follow
upon it; A. P. on the other Hand, &s;hows
that the Nature of <HI>Opium</HI> and other <HI>Ano|dyn&eacute;s</HI>
is &s;uch, as to produce a <HI>Rarification</HI> and
a greater <HI>Velocity</HI> in the Blood, which mu&s;t
di&s;tend the <HI>Arteries.</HI> Are not the&s;e two dif|ferent,
and can there be any thing in the lat|ter
<PB N="48" REF="61">
&s;tolen from the former? <HI>C. O.</HI> here runs
on his ordinary Cour&s;e, makes a <HI>Po$her</HI>
with a Quotation out of <HI>Bellini,</HI> which is no
more to his Purpo&s;e, than one out of <HI>Apollo
Mathematicus.</HI> He complains A. P. has
maim'd and &s;trait'ned <HI>Bellini</HI>'s Doctrine about
the ways of &s;toping the <HI>Influx</HI> of the Ani|mal
Spirits into the <HI>Mu&s;cles;</HI> None of which
A. P. was any ways concern'd about, but
that ari&s;ing from the <HI>R$rifaction</HI> and <HI>Velocity</HI>
of the Blood, which he has duly con&s;idered.
But to let the World &s;ee, what a happy Turn
of Head he him&s;elf has at <HI>Philo&s;ophie, C. O.</HI>
is pleas'd to communicat his own Explicati|on
of Natural Sleep. Sleep &s;ays he (hear
him) is an Unbending of the <HI>Fibres</HI> of the&s;e
<HI>Mu&s;cles,</HI> which have a continual Strugle
with their <HI>Antagoni&s;ts.</HI> Dr. J. is in the
wrong to accu&s;e him of having borrow'd
this Notion; It is an Original, and was never
broach'd by any but him&s;elf. For 1. it &s;up|po&s;es
there may be &s;ome Mu&s;cles without
Antagoni&s;ts or &s;omething equivalent there|unto,
which I am &s;ure never any one dream'd,
who under&s;tood any thing of <HI>Mu&s;cular Mo|tion</HI>
or of the <HI>Animal oeconomy;</HI> for without
an <HI>Antagoni&s;t</HI> or &s;omething equivalent there|unto,
if a Mu&s;cle were once contracted, it
&s;hou'd &s;till continue &s;o. a. At be&s;t this
<PB N="49" REF="62">
Explication points only at an Effect and not
the Formal Cau&s;e of Sleep; For &s;uppo&s;ing this,
we &s;till want to know the Cau&s;e of this Re|laxation
of the <HI>Mu&s;cular Fibres:</HI> And that
this even in the &s;ounde&s;t Acceptation is only
one <HI>Concomitant</HI> of Natural Sleep, is evident
to him, who con&s;iders, that &s;ome Animals
will ly in a carele&s;s unactive Po&s;ture for &s;ome
Weeks, nay Months, without &s;o much as a
<HI>N$p.</HI> 3. We know that there are &s;ome Ani|mals,
which will move all their <HI>M$&s;cles</HI> as
violently when a&s;leep as awake, as Night|walkers
and tho&s;e who talk in their Sleep;
which intirely overthrows this Fine Piece of
Philo&s;ophie. 4. The ea&s;ie&s;t Po&s;ture for the
Members, and that which occa&s;ions the lea&s;t
Expen&s;e of Animal Spirits, is the Mean be|twixt
Extreme Contraction and Expan&s;ion,
And this only requires an <HI>Equilibrium</HI> be|twixt
the <HI>Mu&s;cle</HI> and its <HI>Antagoni&s;t,</HI> and
not an intire Relaxation; for as long as the
Animal lives, there can not be an ab&s;olute
and intire Relaxation even of the Voluntary
Mu&s;cles; for then the <HI>Circulation</HI> through
&s;uch Mu&s;cles wou'd be altogether &s;top'd;
And if all <HI>C. O</HI>'s Mu&s;cles h$t have Antago|ni&s;ts
were intirely relax'd, I &s;hou'd de&s;pa$ of
ever &s;eeing a Reply to the&s;e Papers, for
they &s;ay, <HI>Mortui non mordent,</HI> and I am &s;ure

he wou'd leave none behind him, who wou'd
undertake his Defence in &s;uch a Cau&s;e.
Thus you &s;ee what an Old dog <HI>C. O.</HI> is at
<HI>Philo&s;ophie,</HI> and were it not a great Pity
that all others &s;hou'd not be &s;ilenc'd, that
he alone might have liberty to inform the
World?</P>
<P>VIII. In the La&s;t Place he <HI>Attacques A.
P</HI>'s <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation</HI> about the Cure of Fevers,
and very wi&s;ely imagins, that becau&s;e in
propo&s;ing the <HI>Problem. A. P.</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Si ulla
evacuatio foret eligenda,</HI> he therefore doubted
if any <HI>Evacuation</HI> was proper in Acute Fe|vers;
tho' his only de&s;ign was to de$ermin
the fitte&s;t <HI>Evacuation.</HI> I have before ob&s;erv|ed
that this is the very Language in which
all <HI>Problems</HI> ought to be propo&s;ed, that they
may include all po&s;&s;ible Ca&s;es, and exclude
all Po&s;&s;ible Cavil. <HI>A P.</HI> knew very
well, that in &s;ome Sorts of <HI>Fevers viz.</HI> Slow
con&s;umptive ones, Evacuations often did
Hurt in &s;tead of doing Good, and therefore to
remove all Occa&s;ions of Mi&s;take, he adds this
Limitation, to confine the general word <HI>Fe|vers,</HI>
to Acute ones: He &s;hows here that
any Fluid may be &s;ecern'd by any <HI>Gland,</HI>
and that the <HI>Evacuations</HI> by <HI>Per&s;piration</HI> are
greater than by all the others put together,
which is the only thing he undertook to de|mon&s;trat;
which he has &s;o far perform'd,
<PB N="51" REF="64">
that in my Humble Opinion, this is not
the lea&s;t Accurate <HI>Di&s;&s;ertation</HI> in his whole
Works. But this whole Affair is &s;o plainly
and fully laid down according to <HI>A. P</HI>'s
Mind, in the <HI>New Theory of Fevers,</HI> that
having now at large an&s;wered ev'ry thing
that looks like an Objection (except his
Ra$ling and calling Names) in his refin'd
Pieces, I &s;hall in a Few Words (being alto|gether
weary of &s;o inglorious and unplea&s;ant
a Labour) examin what he has to &s;ay again&s;t
that <HI>Treati&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>I have told the World before, that the
Principal Inducement I had to publi&s;h any
thing on &s;uch a $e$d, was a Concern for the
Honour and Reputation of my Countrey,
having &s;een a good Cau&s;e &s;o pitifully bung|led
by a <HI>Fluttring Pretender:</HI> His In&s;olence
and Indi&s;cretion both in Privat and Publick,
made me afterwards point out the <HI>Jack-daw,</HI>
not by his Name but by a Part of his <HI>inde|lible
Character.</HI> Tho&s;e who know under
what Di&s;advantages and in what Ha&s;te that
Treati&s;e was pen'd, will ea&s;ily pardon its
Failings; &s;uch as they are <HI>C. O.</HI> is neither
capable of mending nor di&s;covering, for it
was not for &s;uch Men I wrote; It had been
unintelligible to him, had it been &s;et off with
all the Finery of <HI>Eloquence;</HI> which neither
<PB N="52" REF="65">
cou'd the Matter $ear, nor my Occa&s;ions fur|ni&s;h
me with; <HI>O$nari res $p&s;a negat contenta
doceri.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding I had told all this
in the Preface, he mo&s;t ingloriou&s;ly falls up|on
the Language, not daring to venture his
<HI>Teeth</HI> upon the Matter, it being too hard for
them: If my Friends here (who are Com|petent
Judges) do not Flatter me too much,
the Language is fitted well enough for the
Matter, which is all that can be done in &s;uch
an Affair; And as <HI>Bellini</HI> has it, He only <HI>di|cend$
ob&s;curitatem cau&s;ahitur, qui nece&s;&s;ariis
di&s;ciplinis non in&s;tructus acce&s;&s;erit.</HI> How|ever,
If that will do him any &s;ervice. I will
give him up the Language, for him and his
Tran&s;lators to exerci&s;e their Talents upon.
It has met with much Better Reception, than
I cou'd either promi&s;e or expect, or than
&s;uch things u&s;ually get. I had in the fir&s;t <HI>Edi|tion</HI>
thereof told that it was indifferent to
me what became of it, &s;ince I neither re&s;ol|ved
to found my Reputation nor Quiet upon
the fortune of &s;uch <HI>Performances.</HI> But &s;ince
it has been kindly receiv'd by &s;ome of the
be&s;t Judges, and &s;ince I know that the Whole
is Demon&s;trable Truth, If I have Lei&s;ure to goe
that Way, I &s;hall put all the Matters con|tain'd
therein in &s;uch a Light, as &s;hall intire|ly
&s;atisfie all tho&s;e who under&s;tand the few
<PB N="53" REF="66">
nece&s;&s;ary <HI>Praecognita,</HI> tho it will always

<Q><L>&mdash;Demetri teq; Tigelli</L>
<L>Di&s;cipularum inter jubeo plorare cathedras.</L></Q>
I &s;hou'd not &s;o much as offer to ju&s;tifie
that Treati&s;e from &s;o Weak Accu&s;ations as
<HI>C. O.</HI> has brought again&s;t it, were it not for
the &s;atisfaction of tho&s;e who have not Lei&s;ure,
or will not give them&s;elves the Trouble to
look into tho&s;e Authors, from whom he has
accus'd me of filching. It is &s;till the &s;ame
Objection, The <HI>New Theory of Fevers</HI> is
wholly &s;toln from <HI>Borelli</HI> aud <HI>Bellini.</HI> Every
body ought to &s;peak di&s;creetly of the&s;e great
men who have de&s;erv'd &s;o very well of Me|dicine,
Yet it is certain as to the pre&s;ent Sub|ject
of Debate, they had Opinions different
from one another, &s;o that one of them at
lea&s;t mu&s;t be in the wrong, and con&s;equently I
cou'd not have &s;toln the &s;ame Doctrine from
'em both. <HI>Borelli's</HI> Opinion is plain from 227
<HI>Prop.</HI> of his Second Part <HI>viz.</HI> that the prin|cipal
cau&s;e of Acute Fevers is the <HI>Succus
nerveus fermentatus &amp; acredine affectus;</HI>
and again <HI>Animadverto quod &s;ucci ilii de&s;tina|ti
ut e nervis expellantur deponanturq$ in

naturam animali noxiam</HI> &amp;c. And again
<HI>Quae excerni debuerant &eacute; nervis</HI> &amp;c. From
which and from his whole Di&s;cour&s;e on this
Head it is evident, that an Acidity (by what
ever Manner acquir'd and) communicated
to the <HI>Nervous juice,</HI> and there by produ|cing
a Frequent $ul&s;e (which he fal&s;ely
thought the Di&s;tingui&s;hing <HI>Symptom</HI> of a Fe|ver,
and that upon which the re&s;t depended)
was in his Opinion the main and principal
Cau&s;e of Acute Fevers: He likeways expre&s;|ly
declares, that the Blood has no part in
the Production of the Fatal Di&s;temper, which
is not only fal&s;e but directly contrary to my
Doctrine, which lays the whole Stre&s;s of the
Affair, on the <HI>Arterial Fluid:</HI> And if the&s;e
two be not different I leave the Reader to
judge. As to <HI>Bellini,</HI> he was indeed a little
nearer the matter, having had Occa&s;ion to
ob&s;erve where and why <HI>Borelli</HI> fail'd; But
then his Doctrine is &s;o general, that it will
apply to any Di&s;temper who&s;e Cau&s;e is in|ternal,
as well as to a Fever. It is evident
from his whole Di&s;cour&s;e on this Subject,
that he was affraid of venturing too far; he
<PB N="55" REF="68">
dar'd not tru&s;t him &s;elf with a&s;&s;igning either
the immediat Cau&s;e, Subject or Place, where
this Mi&s;chief had its Ri&s;e: He is extremly
cautious here, and delivers general <HI>Theorems,</HI>
which indeed are true, but do not come clo&s;e
to the Point. Says he <HI>Prop.</HI> 35. De Febri|bus;
<HI>Febris e&s;t vitium &s;angusnis aut in motu,
aut in quantitate, aut in qualitate ejus, aut
in harum aliquibus aut in omnibus</HI> (which
is the &s;um of his Whole Doctrine on the Head,
as him&s;elf hath compendis'd it) and &s;o in|deed
is ev'ry Di&s;temper who&s;eCau&s;e is inter|nal;
But he no where &s;ays, that The Gene|ral
and mo&s;t Effectual Cau&s;e of all Fevers,
is the <HI>Ob&s;truction</HI> or <HI>Dilatation</HI> of the <HI>Glands.
Vide</HI> Page 11. <HI>New Theory of Fevers.</HI> Be|&s;ides,
neither <HI>Borelli</HI> nor <HI>Bellini</HI> (perhaps at
that time) under&s;tood the true Structure of
the Glands, nor the <HI>adequate</HI> Nature of the
Circulation of the Blood in its full Extent,
upon which the <HI>New Theory</HI> is built. I told
in the <HI>Preface</HI> of that Book, that I made u&s;e
of <HI>Borelli</HI> and <HI>Bellini</HI> and other Authors like|ways,
where they made for my purpo&s;e;
And &s;hou'd have u&s;ed <HI>C. O</HI>'s Noble Works
&s;o too, If I had found any thing in them for
my De&s;ign, that wou'd have endur'd Repeti|tion.
<HI>Borelli</HI> and <HI>Bellini</HI>'s Works are <HI>&s;tandard</HI>
Books, and men who rea&s;on in <HI>Medicine</HI> af|ter
<PB N="56" REF="69">
them, mu&s;t u&s;e them as the text. But I defy <HI>C.
O.</HI> or any one for him, to &s;how any where I have
borrow'd any Principal Propo&s;ition from them, and
have not mention'd it: There is in that <HI>Treati&s;e,</HI> as
&s;hort as it is, <HI>Materials</HI> for a Work as big as either
<HI>Borelli</HI>'s or <HI>Bellini</HI>'s Book; And if &s;ome few of the No|tions
may have been hinted before, the improvements
are all new, and I doubt ev'ry Single Sentence of

out that <HI>A. P</HI>'s Performances are highly &s;erviceable,
both in the Theory and Practice of <HI>Medicine;</HI> and that
they are in the Main both new, ju&s;t and his own; That
the <HI>New Theory of Fevers</HI> is neither &s;toln from <HI>Borelli</HI>

unknown, and that there are many Improvements
