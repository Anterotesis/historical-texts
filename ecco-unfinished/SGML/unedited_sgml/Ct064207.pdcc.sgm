<P>AMong&s;t the numerous Throng that have addre&s;s'd your Lord&s;hip as the undoubted Patron of Wit and Poetry, I pre&s;ume to approach.</P>

<P><PB REF="3">Nor is there in that admiring Crowd, who have laid their Lawrels at your Lord&s;hip's Feet, one who can truly boa&s;t a more profound Re&s;pect than my &s;elf, which is my only Plea for want of Merit, to intitle me to your Lord&s;hip's Protection.</P>
<P>The courteous Affability with which your Lord&s;hip once receiv'd a Trifle from my Hand, rais'd &s;uch grateful Sen|timents in my Brea&s;t, that I have ever &s;ince been ambitious to have your glo|rious Name prefixt as a Sanction for &s;omething of mine, which mu&s;t render it authentick, tho' 'tis what I mu&s;t blu&s;h to lay before you.</P>
<P>To you alone the Mu&s;es pay their grateful Tribute; they are your Slaves, and on what&s;oever Theam you bid 'em &s;ing, they readily obey, and glad the li&s;&s;ening World.</P>

<P>Heaven &s;eems to take peculiar Care of that great Spirit it fir&s;t infus'd in You, transferring a mighty Portion to Your illu&s;trious Son; and in his &s;prightly Youth we &s;ee renew'd the Charms of Yours.</P>
<P>Your noble Line, Your &s;plendid For|tunes, and Your beauteous Offspring, all &s;peak You ble&s;t; and we have only left to wi&s;h, that cheerful Hours of Health may crown long Life, and nothing in|terrupt Your Happine&s;s.</P>

<HEAD>THE PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>WRiting is a kind of Lottery in this fickle Age, and Dependence on the Stage as pre|carious as the Cast of a Die; the Chance may turn up, and a Man may write to plea&s;e the Town, but 'tis uncertain, &s;ince we &s;ee our be&s;t Authors &s;ometimes fail. The Criticks cavil mo&s;t about Decorums, and crie up <HI>Ari&s;totle</HI>'s Rules as the mo&s;t e&s;&s;ential part of the Play; I own they are in the right of it, yet I dare venture a Wa|ger they'll never per&s;uade the Town to be of their Opinion, which reli&s;hes nothing &s;o well as Humour lightly to&s;t up with Wit, and dre&s;t with Mode&s;ty and Air. And I believe Mr. <HI>Rich</HI> will own, he got more by the <HI>Trip to the Jubilee</HI>, with all its Irregularities, than by the most uniform Piece the Stage cou'd boa&s;t of e'er &s;ince. I do not &s;ay this by way of condemning the &V;nity of Time, Place, and Action; quite contrary, for I think them the greate&s;t Beauties of a Dramatick Poem; but &s;ince the other way of writing plea&s;es full
<PB REF="7">
as well, and gives the Poet a larger Scope of Fancy, and with le&s;s Trouble, Care, and Pains, &s;erves his and the Players End, why &s;hou'd a Man torture, and wrack his Brain for what will be no Advantage to him. This I dare engage, that the Town will ne'er be entertain'd with Plays according to the Me|thod of the Ancients, till they exclude this Innovation of Wit and Humour, which yet I &s;ee no likelihood of doing. The following Poem I think has nothing can di&s;oblige the ni|ce&s;t Ear; and tho' I did not ob&s;erve the Rules of <HI>Drama</HI>, I took peculiar Care to dre&s;s my Thoughts in &s;uch a mode&s;t Stile, that it might not give Offence to any. Some Scenes I confe&s;s are partly taken from <HI>Molier</HI>, and I dare be bold to &s;ay it has not &s;uffer'd in the Tran&s;lation: I thought 'em pretty in the French, and cou'd not help believing they might divert in an Engli&s;h Dre&s;s. The French have that light Airine&s;s in their Temper, that the lea&s;t Glimps of Wit &s;ets them a laughing, when 'twou'd not make us &s;o much as &s;mile; &s;o that where I found the Stile too poor, I endeavour'd to give it a Turn; for who e'er borrows from them, mu&s;t take care to touch the Colours with an Engli&s;h Pencil, and form the Piece according to our Manners. When
<PB REF="8">
fir&s;t I took tho&s;e Scenes of <HI>Molier</HI>'s, I de|&s;ign'd but three Acts; for that rea&s;on I cho&s;e &s;uch as &s;uited be&s;t with Farce, which indeed are all of that &s;ort you'll find in it; for what I added to 'em, I believe my Reader will allow to be a different Stile, at lea&s;t &s;ome very good Judges thought &s;o, and in &s;pight of me divi|ded it into five Acts, believing it might pa&s;s among&s;t the Comedies of the&s;e Times. And in|deed I have no rea&s;on to complain, for I confe&s;s it met a Reception beyond my Expectation: I mu&s;t own my &s;elf infinitely oblig'd to the Players, and in a great Mea&s;ure the Succe&s;s was owing to them, e&s;pecially Mr. <HI>Wilks</HI>, who extended his Facul|ties to &s;uch a Pitch, that one may almo&s;t &s;ay he out-play'd him&s;elf; and the Town mu&s;t confe&s;s they never &s;aw three different Characters by one Man acted &s;o well before, and I think my &s;elf extremely indebted to him, likewi&s;e to Mr. <HI>John&s;on</HI>, who in his way I think the be&s;t Comedian of the Age.</P>

<P>Fal&s;hood! by Heav'n I'm certain &s;he never gave Con&s;ent, 'tis her Father's Doings all; for as I told you, he forbad me his Hou&s;e two Days ago, upon what Grounds I know not, but I &s;u&s;pected his Treachery.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
