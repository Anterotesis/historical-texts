<HEAD>THE
Publi&s;her's PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_THE following Piece was accidentally drop'd near
the <HI>Mews</HI> Gate. I pick'd it up in my Way from
<HI>Charing-Cro&s;s</HI> to <HI>Hedge</HI> Lane. 'Twas in a lea|thern
Ca&s;e, which had once been red, but was
grown black with Grea&s;e, and tied round with a Scrap of
dirty Tape. When I open'd the Parcel, I found by an inge|nious
Epigram, that $word$ Tape had formerly belong'd to Mrs. <HI>Haywood,</HI> (the divine <HI>Eliza!</HI>) but whether it had bound
her Hair, or was Part of her Apron-&s;tring, I &s;hou'd have
been at a Lo&s;s to learn, had not the Relict been sanctified by
Mr. <HI>Moore</HI>'s Mu&s;e: He tritely compared it to <HI>Cytherea</HI>'s
Girdle, and &s;ent it as a caluable Pledge of Friend&s;hip to
our Author. In this Pacquet were &s;everal Letters directed
to Mr. <HI>I&s;cariot Hackney,</HI> dated from the <HI>Ship</HI> Tavern, <HI>Cha|ring-Cro&s;s,</HI> and &s;igned <HI>J-m-s M&mdash;Sm-th, L. Th-b-ld, L.
W-l&s;t-d, Edmund Curll, John Dennis, Thomas Cooke,</HI> and <HI>Bezaleel Morris.</HI> Tho&s;e of the earlie&s;t Date import, that <HI>J-m-s M&mdash;Sm-th,</HI> E&s;&abque; was unanimou&s;ly cho&s;en Speaker of
this Society. I met with many more Informations of this
Nature; but what plea&s;ed me most was the Performance of
our Author. I was curious to find out &s;o excellent a Wri|ter,
and have enter'd into a Treaty with him for future
Memoirs, which I have engaged to give the Publick.</P>
<P>It is with much Glee that I have mark'd the Herd bel|lowing
again&s;t the <HI>Dunciad</HI> for Indelicacies. Not to mention
with what an ill Grace this Critici&s;m comes from that
Quarter, I fancy it may ea&s;ily be proved, that the gro&s;&s;est of
tho&s;e Images are mo&s;t &s;uitable to the Subject; a Subject com|po&s;ed,
for the mo&s;t Part, of Authors, who&s;e Writings are the
Refu&s;e of Wit, and who in Life are as the very Excre|ment
<PB REF="4">
of Nature. Yet even here Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> &s;hews him&s;elf a
Ma&s;ter. It is true that he has u&s;ed Dung; but he di&s;po&s;es
that Dung in &s;uch a Manner, that it becomes rich Ma|nure,
from which he rai&s;es a Variety of fine Flowers. He
deals in Rags, but he deals with them like an Arti&s;t,
who commits them to a Paper-Mill, and brings them out
u&s;eful Sheets. The Chymi&s;t extracts a fine Cordial from
the mo&s;t nau&s;eous of all Dung, and Mr. <HI>Pope</HI> has drawn a
&s;weet, poetical Spirit from the mo&s;t offen&s;ive and unpoetical
Objects of the Creation&mdash;Unpoetical, tho' eternal Writers of
Poetry.</P>
<P>I have al&s;o laugh'd at the Clamour of the Gentlemen of the <HI>Bathos</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> for in&s;ulting them on their
Poverty. I own that a Man's Poverty, when it proceeds
not from any Folly, but is owing, (as it often happens) to his
Vertue, &s;ets him in an amiable Light. He becomes the Ob|ject
of Compa&s;&s;ion; and, if he bears his Misfortunes like a
Man, in&s;tead of falling into Contempt, rai&s;es our Admira|tion.
But when his Wants are of his own &s;eeking, and prove
the Motive of every ill Action, (for the Poverty of bad Au|thors
has always a bad Heart for its Companion) is it not
a Vice, and properly the Subject of Satire?</P>
<P>Mo&s;t of the&s;e Per&s;ons are of very low Parentage, and with|out
any Pretence of Merit, $word$ a&s;piring to the Rank of Gen|tlemen.
Thus they become ill Oeconimi&s;ts, Poverty is the
Con&s;equence of ill Oeconomy, and dirty Tricks the Con&s;equence
of their Poverty. Tho they are &s;ad Writers, they might have
been good Mechanicks; and therefore by endeavouring to
&s;hine in Spheres, to which they are unequal, are guilty of de|priving
the Publick of many that might have been its u&s;eful
Members.</P>
<P>Methinks when the World is &s;o ungrateful as not to read
their Writings, they might vouch&s;afe to follow the Example
of the great Sir <HI>Walter Raleigh,</HI> (tho' an Author undoubtedly
inferior to them) who, when he heard the Fir&s;t Part
of his Hi&s;tory &s;ucceeded not, had Spirit enough to commit
the Second to the Flames: But the Gentlemen of the <HI>Bathos</HI>
<PB REF="5">
are apt, like bad Hor&s;es, to run fa&s;ter immediately after
&s;tumbling. Shou'd the Author of the <HI>Dunciad</HI> declare, that
the great Mr. <HI>Dennis</HI> (the Son of a <HI>Sadler</HI>) had better have
been a common Pari&s;h Cryer, than a Poet or Critick! Have
not forty Years, and upwards, witne&s;s'd the Truth of this?
Is it not evident, that his Poverty re&s;ults from a Mi&s;applica|tion
of his Talents?</P>
<P>Had it not been an hone&s;ter and more decent Livelyhood
for Mr. <HI>N-rt-n (Daniel</HI>'s Son of Love, by a Lady, who vended
Oy&s;ters) to have dealt in a <HI>Fi&s;h-Market,</HI> than to be dealing
out the Dialects of <HI>Billing&s;gate</HI> and Detracton in the <HI>Flying
Po&s;t?</HI></P>
<P>Shoud not Mr. <HI>R-ch-rd M-rl-y</HI> rather have been blacking
Shoes at the Corner of Streets (to which, it is well known
his indu&s;trious, and more prudent younger <HI>Brother</HI> &s;ubmitted)
than black'ning Reputations in the <HI>Hi&s;tory</HI> of <HI>Mother Wi&s;e-bourn,</HI>
and <HI>Weekly Journals?</HI> The <HI>Black'ning</HI> of the <HI>Bru&s;h</HI> from the <HI>Japan Pot</HI> is &s;o u&s;eful and ornamental, that it is
frequently call'd <HI>Honour;</HI> but the Da&s;h of <HI>Dick</HI>'s <HI>Pen,</HI> &s;o often
dipt in an <HI>Ink Standi&s;h</HI> is dirty, and detrimental, con&s;e|quently
<HI>Di&s;honour;</HI> &s;o that <HI>Dick</HI> and his <HI>Brother</HI> illu&s;trate
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s <HI>Saying,</HI> Some are made to HONOUR, and
&s;ome to <HI>DISHONOUR.</HI></P>
<P>Had it not been more laudable in Mr. <HI>R&mdash;m,</HI> the Son of
an <HI>Undertaker,</HI> to have borne a <HI>Link,</HI> and a <HI>Mourning Staff</HI>
in the <HI>long Proce&s;&s;ion</HI> of a <HI>Funeral,</HI> than to have been fre|quently
<HI>lamenting</HI> the <HI>Burials</HI> of his <HI>mi&s;erable, &s;hort-lived
Libels?</HI> Had it not been more pious in him, to have &s;ung
P&s;alms, according to Education, in an <HI>Anabapti&s;t Meeting,</HI>
than to have been altering the <HI>Jovial Crew,</HI> or <HI>Merry Beg|gars</HI>
into a <HI>wicked</HI> Imitation of the <HI>Beggar</HI>'s <HI>Opera?</HI></P>
<P>Mr. <HI>Thomas Cooke,</HI> the Tran&s;lator of <HI>He&s;iod,</HI> is the Son
of a <HI>Muggletonian-Teacher,</HI> who kept a little ob&s;cure Ale|hou&s;e
at <HI>Braintree</HI> in <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> Tho' this Author has no more
Genius for Poetry than a Snail, nay le&s;s than Mr. <HI>Ambro&s;e
Phillips,</HI> or Mr. <HI>Wel&s;ted;</HI> and though he would con&s;equently
have wanted Spirit enough for his Father's Tap&s;ter; yet
<PB REF="6">
his Enemies confe&s;s him not without Merit: To do the
Man Ju&s;tice, he might have made a tolerable Figure as
a <HI>Taylor.</HI> 'Twere too pre&s;umtuous to affirm he cou'd have
been a <HI>Ma&s;ter</HI> in any Profe&s;&s;ion; but, dull as I allow him, he
wou'd not have been de&s;picable for a third, or fourth hand <HI>Journeyman.</HI> Then had his Wants been avoided; for he
wou'd at lea&s;t have learn'd, to cut his <HI>Coat according to
his Cloth.</HI></P>
<P>Why wou'd not Mr. <HI>Theobald</HI> continue an Attorney? Is
not <HI>Word-catching</HI> more &s;erviceable in &s;plitting a Cau&s;e, than
explaining a fine Poet?</P>
<P>When Mrs. <HI>H-yw&mdash;d</HI> grew too homely for a <HI>Strolling
Actre&s;s,</HI> why might not the Lady, (tho' once a <HI>Theatrical
Queen)</HI> have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted by turning <HI>Wa&s;her-woman?</HI> Has not
the Fall of Greatne&s;s been a frequent Di&s;tre&s;s in all Ages?
She might have caught a beautiful Bubble as it aro&s;e from
the Suds of her Tub, blown it in Air, &s;een it glitter,
and then break! Even in this low Condition, &s;he had
play'd with a Bubble, and what more is the Vanity
of human Greatne&s;s? She might have al&s;o con&s;ider'd the
&s;ullied Linnen growing white in her pretty red Hands,
as an Emblem of her Soul, were it well <HI>&s;coured</HI> by Repentance
for the Sins of her Youth: But &s;he rather chu&s;es &s;tarving by
writing Novels of Intriegue, to teach young Heire&s;&s;es the Art
of running away with Fortune-hunters, and &s;candalizing
Per&s;ons of the highe&s;t Worth and Di&s;tinction.</P>
<P>When this Lady, or the&s;e Gentlemen are ask'd why they
abu&s;e &s;uch and &s;uch Per&s;ons, their An&s;wer is, they are ob|liged
to write for want of Money, and to abu&s;e for want of
other Subjects. Is want of Money an Excu&s;e for picking a
Pocket? Or what is wor&s;e, taking away a Man's good
Name? Is the Poverty of <HI>Moore</HI>'s Genius an Excu&s;e for <HI>filching Pope</HI>'s Lines? And appears not the Theft in his Co|medy
as plain, as if a Cinder-Wench &s;hou'd &s;teal a Gold
Watch, and afterwards wear it? If this Play was brought
forth, becau&s;e his Circum&s;tances were reduced, was he to
retrieve 'em by committing poetical Felonies, and afterwards
<PB REF="7">
being the fir&s;t to cry out Thief? De&s;erves he not a whipping
for &s;uch petty La&s;ceny? By a whipping be it known I only
mean the poetical, whole&s;ome La&s;h of Satire. A <HI>Dani&s;h</HI> Co|lonel
has lately conde&s;cended to be a common Centinel, and
were <HI>Jemmy</HI>'s Heart as firm as his Countenance, had it not
been more graceful in him, to have carry'd a Grenadier's
Cap, a Buff-Coat, and a brown Mu&s;quet? He is a proper
Figure, and of an exact Size for his <HI>Pru&s;&s;ian</HI> Maje&s;ty's
Service. Then had his Comedy been <HI>fritter'd</HI> into <HI>Oxford
Je&s;ts,</HI> each of his Acquaintance had claim'd their own,
and he e&s;cap'd the Hi&s;&s;es and Hor&s;e-laughs of the Town,
for &s;poiling and mi&s;applying 'em in a damn'd Play.</P>
<P>Methinks <HI>Laurus</HI> had better been an Univer&s;ity Vintner,
than a <HI>Divine,</HI> or <HI>Poet?</HI> Wou'd not bad Wine have been ea&s;ier
put off than bad Poetry? Had not a Bunch of Grapes flou|ri&s;h'd
more naturally on his Brow, than a Sprig of Bays?
Had he not with more Propriety been &s;een &s;itting a&s;tride a <HI>Butt</HI> with a Bottle in one Hand, and a Bumper in the other,
roaring out a merry Catch, than mounting after the fir&s;t
Stave to thump a Pulpit Cu&s;hion, and pau&s;e at every half
Sentence with a Hiccup.?</P>
<P>If Poverty in the&s;e Lights is judged not a Subject for Ri|dicule,
I refer the Reader to <HI>I&s;cariot Hackney,</HI> and after
his Acquaintance with that <HI>Spark,</HI> I will only addre&s;s
my &s;elf in the&s;e few Words to the Allies of <HI>Charing-Cro&s;s.</HI> Say Gentlemen, has the <HI>Dunciad</HI> la&s;h'd your Poverty? A

<HEAD TYPE="sub">BEING
A PROPOSAL to the Knights, E&s;quires, &amp;c.</HEAD>
<LETTER>
<OPENER>GENTLEMEN,</OPENER>
<P>_I AM glad to find you meddle with the dirty
Works of your Brother Journali&s;ts. To be
inoffen&s;ive is a puritannical Spirit, and will ne|ver
&s;ucceed in a free-thinking Age. What is
Gold it&s;elf (&s;ays the Philo&s;opher) but Dirt? It
is dug out of dirty Mines; and, as a Proof it
retains its Nature, we come at it ea&s;ie&s;t thro' dirty Means.
Be a&s;&s;ured, a Scavenger of Wit is a more gainful Occupation
than that of a delicate, moral Writer.</P>
<P>BY this I mean to let you &s;ee my Ability and to proffer my
Service. You mu&s;t know when my Mother was pregnant of
<PB N="2" REF="9">
me, &s;he once dreamt &s;he was delivered of a Mon&s;ter. It
was ob&s;erved al&s;o, at the Time of my Birth, that a Weezle was
heard to &s;hriek; and a Bat (tho' at Noon Day) flew into
the Room, and &s;ettled upon the Midwife's Wri&s;t, ju&s;t as &s;he
received me. While in the Cradle I was very froward.
Early at School I di&s;covered a promi&s;ing Genius for Mi&s;chief.
I carried Tales from one Boy to another to &s;et them a fight|ing,
and afterwards to the Ma&s;ter to have them whipp'd. I
had always Cunning enough, when I committed a Fault, to
lay the Blame upon another, and laugh'd to &s;ee him &s;uffer
for it. (A &s;ure Progno&s;tick of my future Judgment in Poli|ticks!)
I was fond of tearing away the Legs and Wings of
Flies, of picking out the Eyes of &s;ome little Bird, or laming
&s;ome favourite Lap-Dog, merely by way of Amu&s;ement.
This was only a Sign, that one time or other I &s;hould have
Ill-nature enough for a <HI>great Wit.</HI> Now I under&s;tand to be
a <HI>great Wit,</HI> is to take a Plea&s;ure in giving every Body Pain,
and to &s;hew no Mercy to a Reputation, which is dearer to
&s;ome Fools than perhaps a Limb, or an Eye. I was al&s;o gi|ven
to pil&s;er whatever lay in my Way; a Proof only that I
wou'd never &s;cruple being a Plagiary, &s;hou'd I turn Author.
I was expert at almo&s;t every thing except learning my Book;
but neither Encouragement nor Correction could bring me to
any Sen&s;e of Duty. I was always very &s;ullen after being
corrected; and if my Ma&s;ter forgave, and admoni&s;hed me
in a friendly Manner, I all the while ridiculed the old <HI>Put,</HI>
(as I then call'd him) by making Mouths or Horns over his
Shoulder. This &s;hew'd I had always Wit enough to laugh at
the common Notion of Gratitude. I hooted at any unfortu|nate,
ill-dre&s;s'd Per&s;on in the Street, if he look'd like a Gen|tleman,
and never fail'd to mock the Infirmities of <HI>old Age.</HI>
When at a Sermon, I was very full of Play my&s;elf, and fond
of interrupting the Devotion of others; &s;o that (I thank my
Stars!) in my Youth I had a fa&s;hionable Contempt for Reli|gion.
I came young into the World with little Education,
le&s;s Money, and no vi&s;ible Way of living: However, I qua|lified
my&s;elf (tho' of mean Birth) for a Gentleman of Wit
<PB N="3" REF="10">
and Humour about Town. I have naturally a Sourne&s;s of
Temper, a droll Solemnity of Countenance, and a dry Manner
of joking upon &s;uch Accidents, as Fools who value them&s;elves
upon Humanity, would be apt to compa&s;&s;ionate. I have al&s;o
a Propen&s;ity to &s;neer upon all Mankind, and particularly upon
tho&s;e who fancy they can oblige me. The&s;e elegant Quali|ties
recommended me early to the Friend&s;hip of <HI>Dick
Morley,</HI> Author of <HI>Mother Wi&s;eborn.</HI> We met frequently
at a little, &s;nug Gaming-Hou&s;e, never yet di&s;covered by in|forming
Con&s;tables. A Similitude of Circum&s;tances and Sym|pathy
of Souls endeared us to each other; and to him I owe the
Improvements of my afore-mentioned Faculties. The&s;e he cul|tivated,
and many others implanted in me of the like Nature.</P>
<P>WE commenced Authors together. At my fir&s;t &s;etting out
I was hired by a reverend Prebend to libel Dean <HI>Swift</HI> for
Infidelity. Soon after I was employed by <HI>Curll</HI> to write a
merry Tale, the Wit of which was its Ob&s;cenity. This we
agreed to palm upon the World for a po&s;thumous Piece of
Mr. <HI>Prior.</HI> However, a certain Lady, celebrated for certain
Liberties, had a Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the real Author. <HI>Curll,</HI> on
my Promi&s;e that if I had a Pre&s;ent, he &s;hould go Snacks, &s;ent
me to her. I was admitted while her Lady&s;hip was <HI>&s;hifting;</HI>
and on my Admittance, Mrs. <HI>Abigail</HI> was order'd to with|draw.
What pa&s;&s;ed between us, a Point of Gallantry obliges
me to conceal; but after &s;ome extraordinary Civilities, I was
di&s;mi&s;s'd with a Pur&s;e of Guineas, and a Command to write
a Sequel to my Tale. Upon this I turn'd out &s;mart in Dre&s;s,
bit <HI>Curll</HI> of his Share, and run out mo&s;t of my Money in
printing my Works at my own Co&s;t. But &s;ome Years after
(ju&s;t at the time of his &s;tarving poor <HI>Patti&s;on</HI>) the Varlet
was revenged. He arre&s;ted me for &s;everal Months Board,
brought me back to my Garret, and made me drudge on in
my old, dirty Work. 'Twas in his Service that I wrote Ob|&s;cenity
and Profanene&s;s, under the Names of <HI>Pope</HI> and
<HI>Swift.</HI> Sometimes I was Mr. <HI>Jo&s;eph Gay,</HI> and at others
Theory <HI>Burnet,</HI> or <HI>Addi&s;on.</HI> I abridg'd Hi&s;tories and Tra|vels,
<PB N="4" REF="11">
tran&s;lated from the <HI>French,</HI> what they never wrote, and
was expert at finding out new Titles for old Books. When
a notorious Thief was hanged, I was the <HI>Plutarch</HI> to pre|&s;erve
his Memory; and when a great Man died, mine were
his Remains, and mine the Account of his la&s;t Will and Te|&s;tament.
Had Mr. <HI>Oldmixon</HI> and Mr. <HI>Curll</HI> agreed, my A&s;&s;i|&s;tance
had probably been invited into Father <HI>Boheur</HI>'s Lo|gick,
and the critical Hi&s;tory of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>BUT before all this happen'd, a young Nobleman gratified
me for letting &s;ome Ver&s;es of mine be handed about at Court
in Manu&s;cript under his Name. This was the fir&s;t Time that
I ever heard my Writings generally commended. But alas!
how &s;hort-lived the Appl$u&s;e? They unfortunately &s;tole into
Print, lo&s;t their Reputation at once, and I am now a&s;ham'd to
write any more, as a Per&s;on of Quality. I am a great Joker,
and deal in Clenches, Puns, Quibbles, Gibes, Conundrums, and
carry Whichits. Many a good Time have I la&s;h'd the whole
Body of Clergy, and crack'd many a &s;mart Joke upon the Trini|ty.
One of my Books had the Honour of being pre&s;ented for a
Libel, by the Grand-Jury, and another was made a Burnt-Offering
by the Hands of the Common Hangman. When an
Author writes a Piece that has Succe&s;s in his own Character,
I abu&s;e him; but if in a fictitious one, I endeavour to per&s;o|nate
him, and write a Second Part to his Work. I am very
deeply read in all Pieces of Scandal, Ob&s;cenity, and Profane|ne&s;s,
particularly in the Writings of Mrs. <HI>Haywood, Henley,
W'&mdash;l&s;t&mdash;d, Morley, Br&mdash;v&mdash;l, Foxton, Cooke, D'Foe, Norton,
Wool&s;ton, Dennis,</HI> and the Author of the <HI>Rival Modes.</HI> From
the&s;e I propo&s;e to compile a very grand Work, which &s;hall
not be inferior to <HI>Utopia, Carimania, Gulliverania, Art of
Flogging, Daily Journal</HI> Epigrams on the <HI>Dunciad,</HI> or
<HI>Oratory Tran&s;actions;</HI> and as this is de&s;igned for the U&s;e of
young Templers, it is hoped they will promote my Sub&s;crip|tion.
Since private Vices have been proved to be publick
Benefits, I wou'd venture to call it, <HI>An u&s;eful Body of</HI> IM|MORALITY,
and print it in a broad, pompous Folio; but &s;uch
<PB N="5" REF="12">
a one as may very well be bound up with Dean <HI>Smedley</HI>'s in|tended
<HI>Body</HI> of <HI>Divinity.</HI></P>
<P>BY the Help of Indexes, and technical Dictionaries, I work
on every Branch of Learning. I pore often over the Volumes
of State Tracts, whence I collect Paragraphs which I mix
with Remarks of my own, and range under &s;everal Heads.
Tho&s;e again&s;t a di&s;carded Mini&s;ter I &s;end to the <HI>London</HI> and
<HI>Briti&s;h Journals,</HI> and others more virulent again&s;t a Prime
One (for I naturally hate my Superiors) are for my very good
Friend the <HI>Craft&s;man.</HI> Rather than &s;tand out of Play, I have
penn'd Panegyricks in <HI>Mi&s;t</HI> on <HI>Rich</HI>'s Pantomines, and <HI>Theo|bald</HI>'s
<HI>Shake&s;pears Re&s;tored.</HI> I am always li&s;ted by Mr. <HI>Lun</HI>
the Harlequin, to hi&s;s the fir&s;t Night at any of the <HI>Drury-Lane</HI>
Performances. Sometimes I draw up Challenges for the
Champions of Mr. <HI>Figg</HI>'s Amphitheatre, and &s;ometimes for
the Di&s;putants of Mr. <HI>Henley</HI>'s Oratory.</P>
<P>I HAVE an excellent Knack at Birth-day Odes, Elogies,
Acro&s;ticks, Anagrams, Epithalamiums, Prologues, Recom|mendatory
Poems, Rhimes for Almanack-Makers, and witty
Di&s;tichs for the Signs of Country Inns and Ale-hou&s;es. When
with an audible Voice I &s;pout forth my own Ver&s;es, marve|lous
is their Effect! The very Bellman has been touch'd with
Envy!&mdash;An Author, who like Mr. <HI>Ralph,</HI> has di&s;tingui&s;h'd
him&s;elf by <HI>Night;</HI> the Shrilne&s;s of my clamorous, dunning
Landlady has been charm'd into a &s;till Attention! Nay, the
very Bailiff, in act to ru&s;h upon me, has &s;top'd &s;hort to li&s;ten,
and for a Minute &s;u&s;pended the rapacious Palm that was to
fall upon my Shoulder!</P>
<P>I HAVE well peru&s;ed the Writings of <HI>Luke Milbourn, Shad|well,
Settle, Blackmore,</HI> and many others of our Stamp, no|table
for &s;alt Wit upon <HI>Dryden.</HI> From the&s;e I have extract|ed
curious Hints to a&s;&s;i&s;t <HI>Wel&s;ted</HI> in his new Satire again&s;t
<HI>Pope,</HI> which was once (he told me) to have been chri&s;ten'd
<HI>Labeo.</HI> 'Tis yet an Embrio, and there are divers Opinions
<PB N="6" REF="13">
about the Birth of it. Some expect it will &s;pring from his
wi&s;e Noddle, like <HI>Minerva</HI> from the Head of <HI>Jupiter,</HI> and
work Wonders. Others, that it will re&s;emble <HI>Milton</HI>'s Fi|gure
of <HI>Sin</HI> coming from the Brain of the Father of Lies.
Then, &s;ay they, it will damn its Parent's Reputation. But
mo&s;t are of Opinion, that my Brother has no Reputation to
lo&s;e, and therefore the Brat will be &s;till-born. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible
<HI>Barnham Goode</HI> al&s;o may mi&s;carry of his <HI>Mock Ae&s;op,</HI> tho'
<HI>James Moore Smythe,</HI> E&s;&abque; is to officiate Man-Midwife.</P>
<P>WHEN a Man of Quality is di&s;tingui&s;h'd for Wit, or an
Encourager of it, I endeavour to &s;trike him for a Dedication;
but I have generally been &s;o unhappy as to di&s;gu&s;t my Patrons
by prai&s;ing them in the wrong Place. For want of being ac|quainted
with polite Life, I have unwittingly complemented
a Per&s;on for an illu&s;trious Birth, who really owed his Ri&s;e en|tirely
to his Merit. Thus have I cau&s;ed his Enemies to &s;neer,
and, perhaps, to libel him for my &s;quab Complement; when,
had I left him to his Choice, he had rather cho&s;e my Satire
than my Panegyrick.</P>
<P>THERE is a certain Right Honourable <HI>Didapper Knight</HI> of
the <HI>BATH-os,</HI> a Man of my Name&s;ake, <HI>I&s;cariot</HI>'s own Pro|bity,
and famous, like one of the Suitors in <HI>Homer</HI>'s <HI>Ody&s;&s;ey,</HI> for
<HI>dead-born Je&s;ts.</HI> Many a Sonnet of mine, and &s;everal <HI>Bouts
Rimez</HI> that were filled up by me, has he read with his u&s;ual
Mode&s;ty, at <HI>White</HI>'s and the Drawing-Room for his own; but as
they were mere Slips of my Pen, and could be of no Advantage
to my Reputation, (low as it &s;tands) I am contented to humour
his Vanity, and forbear to claim them. To deal plainly, this
little Knight is a Per&s;on whom I, even I, <HI>I&s;cariot Hackney,</HI>
treat with Contempt; and furthermore, I fear no Revenge
from him for publi&s;hing this Declaration, unle&s;s he &s;hould
<HI>breathe</HI> upon me&mdash;It mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, indeed, there is a
&s;trange Influence in all that i&s;&s;ues from his <HI>Mouth.</HI> I a&s;&s;i&s;ted
him in a pretty Play of Words on the Letter <HI>P,</HI> and the Ad|verti&s;ement
of the <HI>Lady</HI>'s <HI>Writing Desk;</HI> for which our
<PB N="7" REF="14">
Printer underwent the Di&s;cipline of the Cane. I was really &s;or|ry
for the poor Fellow's Misfortune, and cou'd have heartily
wi&s;hed it had fallen with more Ju&s;tice and le&s;s Mercy on the
little &s;mart Knight. Soon after I chopp'd Sides, and wrote
the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Norfolk Dumpling,</HI> the Ver&s;es on the
<HI>Norfolk Lanthorn,</HI> and many other popular Libels on Per&s;ons
who lea&s;t de&s;erv'd them; but the Rea&s;on of that was, be|cau&s;e
they were of the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>Now is the Se&s;&s;ion of Parliament, and the Poetical Quar|rels
mu&s;t give way to the Political. Con&s;equently the Affairs
of State (as <HI>Abel</HI> in the Play of the <HI>Committee</HI> ob&s;erves) <HI>will
lie heavy upon my Neck and Shoulders.</HI> It is a Cu&s;tom a|mong
great Generals to &s;end Spies into an Enemy's Camp,
and among Politicians to employ 'em in foreign Courts. I
have therefore (as I am determined to oppo&s;e the Mini&s;try)
&s;ettled a &s;ecret Corre&s;pondence with &s;everal Gentlemen of the
Party-colour'd Cloth; Men of Dignity! &s;uch as have no le&s;s
an Honour than that of holding a Plate in the Pre&s;ence of
&s;ome certain Knights of the Blue Ribbon. My Bribe is a Pot
of Ale, and my Intelligence the Scraps of Conver&s;ation that
fall at the Table of great Mini&s;ters. By the&s;e I am enabled
to di&s;cu&s;s the Matters in debate at the <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI>
and the Congre&s;s of <HI>Soi&s;&s;ons,</HI> to &s;tate the Debts of the Na|tion,
to arraign the Conduct of tho&s;e at Helm, and to
hold the Balance of <HI>Europe</HI> with as much Ea&s;e as a Monkey
does a Chesnut, in my own Paw.</P>
<P>THE Time has been when, after an Evening's hard booz|ing,
my brother Bards (who have been what we call Seedy
or Crop-&s;ick) have bilked the publick Hou&s;e, and barbarou&s;ly
left me in pawn for the Reckoning. On this Emergency I
have written an Account of a <HI>&s;harp and bloody Fight, a Vi|&s;ion
in the Air,</HI> or a <HI>Wonderful Prophecy</HI> to be hawk'd about
Streets: And (wou'd you believe it?) even the&s;e Producti|ons
of mine have pa&s;s'd for de&s;ign'd Wit, and I have
<PB N="8" REF="15">
&s;ilently &s;neered, to find the Merit of them claimed and boa&s;t|ed
of by <HI>Jemmy Moore,</HI> and the above-mention'd <HI>Knight.</HI></P>
<P>I HAVE &s;ometimes taken it in my Head, that I might
make a Fortune by writing for the Stage. As a Proof that I
have an excellent Ta&s;te, I always de&s;pi&s;ed the Tragedies of
<HI>Shake&s;peare, Otway;</HI> and <HI>Young,</HI> and preferr'd with Admira|tion
Mr. <HI>Rolli</HI>'s Opera's at the <HI>Hay-Market.</HI> I wonder, that
the Succe&s;s of the Latter &s;hou'd be applied to Mr. <HI>Hendell</HI>'s
Mu&s;ick, or the Performances of <HI>Sene&s;ino, Fau&s;tina,</HI> and <HI>Cut|zoni:</HI>
the Town in this have been &s;hamefully blind to the
Merit of Mr. <HI>Rolli.</HI> He has followed the Antients &s;o clo&s;ely
in the Propriety of his Conduct, the Unity of his Characters,
the natural Variety of Pa&s;&s;ions, the Strength of Sentiment,
and the Elegance of Diction, that I here invite him to join
with me in an <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Tragedy on an Opera Plan.</P>
<P>IF the Gentleman thinks this too arduous an Undertaking,
let us venture at a lower Ca&s;t! In fine, let us make the Town
an ample Amends for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of Mr. <HI>Gay</HI>'s Sequel!
without any Recour&s;e to Wit, Humour, Natural Dialogue,
Songs aptly introduced, or any other of tho&s;e Trifles with
which the <HI>Beggar's Opera</HI> abounds. We have one &s;ure Com|fort;
that is, we cannot fall &s;hort of Mr. <HI>John&s;on's Village
Opera,</HI> nor be excell'd by <HI>R&mdash;m</HI> and his Didapper <HI>Knight:
R&mdash;m</HI> cannot excel me, unle&s;s he excels him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I HAVE tried all Means (but what Fools call hone&s;t ones)
for a Livelihood. I offer'd my Service for a &s;ecret Spy to the
State; but had not Credit enough even for that. When it
was indeed very low with me, I printed Propo&s;als for a Sub|&s;cription
to my Works, received Money, and gave Receipts
without any Intention of delivering the Book. Tho' I have
been notoriou&s;ly prophane, and was never at an Univer&s;ity, I
once aim'd to be admitted into Orders; but being obliged to
ab&s;cond lately from the Pari&s;h-Officers, on Account of a Ba|&s;tard
<PB N="9" REF="16">
Child, and falling be&s;ides into an unlucky Salivation,
my Character was &s;o &s;candalous, that I cou'd not prevail even
on the lowe&s;t of the Fleet-Pri&s;on Par&s;ons to &s;ign my Te&s;ti|monials.</P>
<P>MY la&s;t Attempt was to have been a Travelling Tutor to
&s;ome young Gentleman. If I am deficient in Cla&s;&s;ic Lear|ning,
I cou'd yet have in&s;tructed him in the Laws of his own
Country; for tho' I never &s;tudied <HI>Coke</HI> upon <HI>Littleton,</HI> yet I
have conver&s;ed with Bailiffs and petty-fogging Attornies; nay,
I have conn'd over the <HI>Abridgements of</HI> Giles Jacob; I cou'd
al&s;o have read him Lectures of Politicks from E&s;&s;ays of my
own in <HI>Weekly Journals.</HI> What, tho' I wanted Knowledge
to make Di&s;&s;ertations upon the Languages, Manners, Hi&s;tories,
Statutes, Coins, Paintings, Architecture, or any other Curio|&s;ities,
ancient or modern of foreign Climes? what, tho' I
cou'd not have traced out any one Country in a Map? cou'd
I not have pillaged Voyage Writers, and have taken the Re|ports
of Inn-Keepers or Po&s;tilions, to have told where there
were good Wine, good Beds, buxom Girls, and tall Steeples?
Few foreign Tutors under&s;tand the dead Languages; but if
they play at Cards, dance, talk of Things they never &s;aw;
or, having &s;een, cou'd not under&s;tand; if they put on the
&s;waggering Air of Half-pay Captains, and &s;wear <HI>French</HI> mili|tary
Oaths with a <HI>bon Grace,</HI> will they not pa&s;s for Men of
Wit, Experience, and Knowledge? I &s;hou'd have made a ve|ry
fa&s;hionable Tutor, I wou'd have &s;pirited up my Pupil to
run away with a Nun; and, if he aimed at &s;maller Game,
not &s;crupled being Pimp. I have &s;tudied Phy&s;ick under
the <HI>Anodyne Necklace</HI> Doctor, and wou'd have prepared,
and exported a whole Cargo of <HI>Anti-venereal</HI> Pills for his
Safety. No one, I am per&s;waded will blame me, if I took
this Opportunity of feathering my own Ne&s;t. I &s;hou'd per|haps
have made him pay Ten <HI>per Cent.</HI> for his own Money,
when I disbur&s;ed it, and a Guinea on many Occa&s;ions for his
Honour; twenty Shillings of which I might have put in my
own Pocket. Who knows but I might have married &s;ome rich
Widow by &s;ecuring my Pupil for one of her Daughters? I
<PB N="10" REF="17">
wou'd have contrived he &s;hou'd have &s;tolen the young Lady
to avoid paying her Fortune. If this Scheme failed, I had
another, for which I am afraid I might have been a little cen|&s;ured;
'twas only to have &s;et him at a gaming Table (when
abroad) for about a thou&s;and Pounds, and afterwards gone
Snacks with the Sharpers. But on &s;econd Thoughts, where
had been the Hurt? When return'd, and at Age, I cou'd ea|&s;ily
have made him Amends, by negotiating a Mortgage, or
the Sale of a Rever&s;ion for him with hone&s;t <HI>Ch-rt-r-s.</HI></P>
<P>THUS, tho' I had but a hundred a Year, and for no more
than two, or three Years Service, I cou'd retire to <HI>Swi&s;&s;erland,</HI>
or <HI>Wales,</HI> with about Fifteen Hundred Pounds in my Pocket,
and an Anuity of fifty Pounds <HI>per Annum</HI> for Life. In
&s;uch a Retirement I &s;hou'd have &s;et down like my Brother
<HI>Br-v-l</HI> to writing an <HI>Account of my Travels.</HI> When tho&s;e
were fini&s;hed, by carefully extracting from Gazettes, I &s;hou'd
have been able to have left my Executors the Memoirs of
my own Times, then wou'd I have indulged my Spleen a|gain&s;t
the pre&s;ent Mini&s;ters, for neglecting to gratify my Me|rit.
'Tis dangerous to anger a Poet or Hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>I ob&s;erved at the Head of this Letter, that I have a Drol|lery
in my Countenance; Egad! 'tis as <HI>peculiar</HI> a One as
<HI>R-m's.</HI> We are &s;o like, that before he &s;cribled him&s;elf in|to
Preferment, we have actually been mi&s;taken for each o|ther.
Our Looks are &s;o happy, as to have pa&s;s'd off many a
Saying in Conver&s;ation for Wit and Humour, that, when pub|li&s;hed,
has been thought flat: Nay, the &s;ame Thing has been
&s;aid of me, as was utter'd by a certain <HI>Wit</HI> (one very different
from our Rank) on him, viz. that the <HI>R-g-'s Misfortune is,
he cannot print his Face to his Joke.</HI></P>
<P>WHILE I am thus delineating my Features, permit me to
own, that I wi&s;h my Portrait might &s;hine in a <HI>Mezitento</HI>
thro' the Gla&s;s-Windows of Picture-Shops in <HI>Fleet-Street,</HI> and
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Church-Yard; then &s;hou'd I be gaz'd on with Ad|miration
by Mercers 'Prentices! But I will at lea&s;t Indulge my
<PB N="11" REF="18">
Vanity in appearing on a large Sheet of Paper, in a Wooden
Cut, which ingenious School-Boys may delight to Colour
with yellow and red <HI>Ocker.</HI> What a glaring Figure &s;hall
I then make in the long Piazza of <HI>Covent-Garden!</HI> I &s;hall be
&s;urrounded by venerable Old Ballads; and &s;everal of my
Family Pieces, &s;uch as the <HI>Sinners Coat of Arms,</HI> and the
dreadful Sketches of <HI>Death, Judgment,</HI> and <HI>Damnation!</HI>
Thence &s;hall I be tran&s;lated to the naked Walls of Country
Ale-hou&s;es, Coblers Stalls, and Nece&s;&s;ary Hou&s;es!&mdash;And
thou, O <HI>R-m,</HI> thou who art my <HI>other &s;elf!</HI> be this thy
Glory! however different our Fortunes, however unlike the
Incidents of our Lives; yet when&s;oe'er the Countenance of
<HI>I&s;cariot Hackney</HI> is &s;een, thy own <HI>dear Phiz</HI> will be called
to Remembrance.</P>
<P>IN &s;hort, I am a perfect Town Author: I hate all Man|kind,
yet am occa&s;ionally a mighty Patriot. I am very poor,
and owe my Poverty to my Merit; that is, to my Writings:
I am as proud as I am poor; yet, what is &s;eemingly a Con|tradiction,
never &s;tick at a mean Action, when the Welfare
of the Republick of Letters; or, in other Words, my own
Intere&s;t is concerned. My Pen, like the Sword of a <HI>Swi&s;s,</HI>
or the pleading of a <HI>Lawyer,</HI> is generally employed for <HI>Pay.</HI>
There is one Piece of Advice, Gentlemen, which I wou'd pro|po&s;e
to you: If any Papers of a <HI>dead Wit</HI> &s;hou'd fall into the
Hands of a Member of your Society, let him be &s;ure to print
them, tho' never &s;o derrogatory to the Per&s;on's Reputation,
to get him&s;elf Money; and if, among whole Heaps of indi|ge&s;ted
Papers, he finds a few with large <HI>Corrections</HI> and <HI>Ad|ditions</HI>
by <HI>another eminent Hand</HI> (which he well knows) let
him be &s;ure to &s;uppre&s;s <HI>that Circum&s;tance</HI> in his Publication.</P>
<P>BUT to return to my&s;elf&mdash;My Pamphlets sell many more
Impre&s;&s;ions than tho&s;e of celebrated Writers; the Secret of
this is, I learned from <HI>Curll</HI> to clap a new Title-Page to
the Sale of every half Hundred; &s;o that when my Book&s;eller
has &s;old Two Hundred and Fifty Copies, my Book generally
enters into the <HI>Sixth Edition,</HI> 'Tis reckon'd a villanous
<PB N="12" REF="19">
Action to write a Libel, but more &s;o to father one on a Per|&s;on,
who neither wrote it, nor approves it; now, I own I ne|ver
&s;cruple to do both. When a Man of Figure (perhaps an
Ornament of his Country) has been cruelly a&s;per&s;ed in his
Life-time, I love to revive the A&s;per&s;ion at his Death: It is
Mirth to me to grieve a whole Family, by in&s;ulting his Me|mory
before his Body is cold in the Grave. In this I imitate
the Author of <HI>Sarah the Quaker in the Shades,</HI> to <HI>Lotha|rio
lately decea&s;ed.</HI> Tho' I am &s;o ready to libe. others, I am
downright frighten'd if I but hear of a Satire where my Name
is likely to be in&s;erted. When a Per&s;on does me a Favour, I
either &s;u&s;pect he has &s;ome De&s;ign on me; or think it le&s;s than
my due, and that he is obliged to me, becau&s;e an <HI>Author,</HI> for
accepting it. I am very te&s;ty if I am not allow'd <HI>Dictator</HI>
of my Company; nor had I ever a Friend, whom I did not in
his Ab&s;ence &s;acrifice to my Je&s;t. I comtemn the Few who ad|mire
me, am angry with the Multitude who de&s;pi&s;e me, and
mortally hate all, who have any Ways obliged me. I a&s;&s;ure
you I am very famous for &s;everal Treati&s;es in Defence of <HI>In|gratitude.</HI>
I never fail to illu&s;trate them with the Examples of
<HI>Marcus Brutus</HI> among the <HI>Ancients,</HI> and very eminent <HI>State&s;|men</HI>
among the <HI>Moderns.</HI> My private Re&s;entment, like that of
other <HI>Great Men,</HI> is always a publick Ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Now, Gentlemen, if you like me for a Corre&s;pondent, my
Price is the Price of a <HI>Journali&s;t,</HI> a Crown; and, in the Stile
of a Love Bargain, Half Wet, Half Dry. You may find me in
a Morning at my Lucubrations, over a Quartern Pot in a <HI>Ge|neva</HI>
Shop in <HI>Clare-Marke$;</HI> a Hou&s;e where I propo&s;e many
learned Interviews with Orator <HI>Henley,</HI> who has removed his
<HI>Stage</HI> to that Place. I generally dine with a Brother <HI>Bard</HI> at
one of the little Cook's Shops near St. <HI>Martin</HI>'s Church, and
pro$ably &s;pend the Evening with him at a Night-Cellar in the
<HI>Strand,</HI> where I &s;hall be ready to enter into a Treaty with
you.</P>
<CLOSER><HI>Yours,</HI>
From my Chamber,
<HI>H$ckley in the Hole.</HI>
