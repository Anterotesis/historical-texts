<HEAD>A New Te&s;t OF THE SENCE OF THE NATION.</HEAD>
<P>THERE are now &s;o many Ways contriv'd to bya&s;s the Judgment of the People, and the People them&s;elves have taken up &s;o many New Ways to expre&s;s them|&s;elves, that we are oblig'd to take <HI>New Ways al&s;o,</HI> to under&s;tand them by. Nothing is more cer|tain, than that the Methods of Under&s;tanding Things mu&s;t vary as the Methods of Expre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="2" REF="3">
them vary, or el&s;e the Actions of Men will &s;oon come to &s;peak a Language not at all to be un|der&s;tood, and the Voice of Things will have as much Confu&s;ion as the Voices of Men had of Old at the Building of <HI>Babel.</HI></P>
<P>Among the great Variety there is to be found in the World of this Kind, nothing &s;eems more remarkable, than the frequent Alterations made in the Meanings of the &s;ame Things, whether &s;poken or done in the&s;e few late Years; by which it is grown prepo&s;terous to expect, that Men &s;hou'd be &s;uppos'd to mean the &s;ame Thing to Day, that they meant ye&s;terday by the &s;ame Words.</P>
<P>This might be illu&s;trated by many Examples, but by nothing more plainly than by the various U&s;e, Intent, Meaning and De&s;ign of SWEARING; e&s;pecially that of Taking or Refu&s;ing Oaths to Governments, Allegiance to, and Abjuration of Princes, and the like.</P>
<P><HI>Here</HI> Men &s;tand off, and refu&s;e to take Oaths to the la&s;t Minute, and then with the utmo&s;t Re|luctance, to &s;ave a Place, Benefit, or Preferment, they take this Oath, and yet at the &s;ame Time, &s;wear that they do it <HI>Heartily, Willingly</HI> and <HI>Truly.</HI></P>
<P><HI>In another Ca&s;e,</HI> Men abjure Foreign Preten|ders, <Q>&startq;&endq;Declaring, Te&s;tifying, Profe&s;&s;ing and Acknowledging <HI>(Vide the Abjuration)</HI> that they do believe in their Con&s;cience, that the Pre|tended Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> or King <HI>James</HI> III. &s;o calling him&s;elf, hath not any Claim, or Title to the Crown of this Realm, &amp;c.</Q></P>
<P>And at the &s;ame Time, the&s;e Gentlemen in their open Profe&s;&s;ion, acknowledge the &s;aid Pretender, <HI>Drink his Health</HI> upon their Knees, Pray <HI>Cap in Hand,</HI> for his Re&s;titution, and Act openly for his Intere&s;t; of which, the Author humbly prays, the &s;wearing <HI>Jacobites</HI> not to put
<PB N="3" REF="4">
him to the Nece&s;&s;ity of bringing numerous Ex|amples, for Fear of a <HI>Black Li&s;t,</HI> they wou'd not be glad to &s;ee come abroad in the World.</P>
<P>And yet all the&s;e Contradictions are ea&s;ie to be reconcil'd, and the Hone&s;ty and Integrity of the Parties may be clearly defended, and this is the Work of the pre&s;ent Undertaking, per|haps, you may think it difficult, but you may be of another Opinion when you have duly con|&s;ider'd the Particulars.</P>
<P>There is a Thing call'd <HI>The Sence of the Na|tion;</HI> by which, all Things of this Kind are deter|min'd and under&s;tood; and this prevails not again&s;t the Literal Meaning of Words only, but again&s;t the plain and vi&s;ible Con&s;truction of Mens Actions, and is now become the only true Rule to judge by. <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> has by the Law of Nations, obtain'd a very great Authority all over the World, having in all Ages, been the only Judge of <HI>Propriety,</HI> the Guide of Languages, the Allow'd Authority for Speech, and having given the true Legitimacy to Words. From hence, It is a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Con&s;e|quence as well as a certain Truth, that <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> is the great Arbiter of <HI>Meaning</HI> in Speech: Nor can we give any greater Rea&s;on, nor <HI>in many Ca&s;es,</HI> any other Rea&s;on, for the Exten&s;ivene&s;s of Words, than the Cu&s;tom and U&s;age of the Country, that is in <HI>Eng|li&s;h, The Sence of the Nation.</HI> No Man can &s;ay, why a <HI>Spade</HI> is call'd a <HI>Spade,</HI> or a <HI>Tree</HI> a <HI>Tree;</HI> why <HI>Whore</HI> &s;ignifies a <HI>Leud Woman;</HI> why a <HI>weak-headed Man</HI> is call'd a <HI>Fool;</HI> why a Man that <HI>robs</HI> another is call'd a <HI>Thief:</HI> But that it is the Cu&s;tom of the Place, that &s;uch Words &s;hall be &s;o under&s;tood, or to &s;peak more plainly, <HI>This is the Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>The &s;ame Authority is given for <HI>&s;everal Words</HI> &s;ignifying the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Thing, or <HI>&s;everal</HI> Things being
<PB N="4" REF="5">
&s;ignify'd by the <HI>&s;ame</HI> Word, frequent In&s;tances of which are to be given in our Language, and all are legitimated by <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> as the <HI>Sen&s;e of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>By this Authority of <HI>Custom</HI> a <HI>High-Church-Man</HI> and a <HI>Mad-Man,</HI> a <HI>Tory</HI> and a <HI>Thief,</HI> a <HI>Whig</HI> and a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> are all become &s;ynonimous to one ano|ther; tho' if we take the People and examine them apart, they pretend quite other Things; <HI>but</HI> it mu&s;t be &s;o under&s;tood, for <HI>'Tis the Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>But what &s;hall we &s;ay to a new Tyranny of <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> which is now invading us with Exotick Significations of Words, &s;uch as were never heard of here before: By which, for Example, a <HI>Sacheverellite</HI> and a <HI>Jaco|bite,</HI> <HI>Mad-Juror</HI> and a <HI>Non-Juror,</HI> a <HI>High-Flyer</HI> and a <HI>French-Pani&s;t</HI> are become &s;ynonimous, and &s;igni|fy the &s;ame Thing; nor are the Etimologies or Vulgar Acceptations of the Words to be alter'd, or their Agreement to be interrupted by the Ca&s;ual Intervention of <HI>Taking</HI> or <HI>Refu&s;ing</HI> Oaths, Abjura|tions, A&s;&s;ociations, or any &s;uch Trifles upon any Account what&s;oever, <HI>The Rea&s;on is plain,</HI> for &s;uch is the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>All this is brought to pa&s;s, by the Wonderful A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and Irre&s;i&s;table Force of <HI>CUSTOM,</HI> which, by her ab&s;olute Authority in the Kingdom of Speech, has full Power to cau&s;e what Con&s;truc|tion <HI>&s;he plea&s;es</HI> to be put upon Words, and to cau&s;e them to be under&s;tood <HI>as be&s;t may &s;erve</HI> to her Royal Ends and Purpo&s;es;&mdash;making tho&s;e Con&s;tructions become <HI>The Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>

<P><HI>We are next to prove,</HI> The Great U&s;efulne&s;s and Convenience of this to Mankind, and con&s;equently,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
the Rea&s;onablene&s;s, and indeed, Nece&s;&s;ity of Sub|mitting to this Government of <HI>Cu&s;tom;</HI> as al&s;o, that <HI>in all Ages,</HI> and in <HI>all Nations,</HI> &s;he has exercis'd this Authority, and that, therefore, having Pre&s;cription to plead for it, &s;he is entitul'd by her <HI>immemorial &s;elf</HI> to an <HI>inde&s;eizible Title</HI> to it, and may indeed her|&s;elf be call'd <HI>The Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>And fir&s;t, to the U&s;efulne&s;s of it,&mdash;in which it appears like the <HI>Copernican</HI> Sy&s;tem <HI>of Philo&s;ophy,</HI> which, tho' it admits of many Doubts, and has &s;ome Difficulties in it, which can allow no Demon|&s;tration, yet <HI>is receiv'd,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>by that $word$</HI> we can the better &s;olve other <HI>Phenomena</HI> in Nature, which were perfectly unaccountable, and indeed, inconceivable before: So in this Ca&s;e, tho' there may be &s;ome Objections perhaps, unan&s;werable a|gain&s;t this Tyranny of Cu&s;tom, and &s;ome Diffi|culties in our Subjection to it, which &s;eem ab&s;urd, and admit of no Demon&s;tration, yet <HI>we receive it</HI> as a Thing, by which, we can better &s;olve &s;ome &s;trange and wonderful <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in the Conduct of Mankind, which can no otherwi&s;e be accounted for, but by their being <HI>The Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>By this Glorious Sy&s;tem, a Man may &s;ail <HI>North</HI> and <HI>South</HI> at the &s;ame Time in the great Ocean of Politicks; two Men may turn Back to Back in the great Road of Allegiance, and One Travel, <HI>that is, Swear,</HI> one Way, One another; and marching on &s;trait forward meet at the &s;ame Point of Truth and Sincerity. <HI>For Example,</HI> A Man may <HI>&s;wear</HI> to the Man he <HI>fights again&s;t,</HI> and <HI>fight</HI> for the Man he <HI>&s;wears again&s;t:</HI> And all this only by <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> &s;tepping in, and legitimating the Word <HI>SWEARING,</HI> and <HI>JESTING,</HI> to mean the &s;ame Thing in <HI>The Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Nor is this a Novelty, or &s;tarted to gratify a Party, <HI>No, no, Gentlemen;</HI> I will not do the <HI>Jacobites</HI>
<PB N="6" REF="7">
&s;o much Wrong. <HI>However nece&s;&s;ary it may, at this Time, be to their Cau&s;e,</HI> and therefore, very happily made U&s;e of by the Fathers of their Flock; but the Thing has ever been the <HI>Cu&s;tom,</HI> of &s;uch Kind of People as they are compos'd of, <HI>and e&s;pecially among its,</HI> and is, therefore, to be taken here as the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>Nor &s;hall I need to be &s;ent back to the Hea|then Ages of the World, whether <HI>Grecian</HI> or <HI>Roman,</HI> in which, tho' the like Authority of <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> had in|troduc'd the <HI>like Practice,</HI> yet Generous Principles had almo&s;t prevailed to explode her Authority; &s;ince it has been ob&s;erv'd, to revive with the In|troduction of Chri&s;tianity, and to obtain more among the Chri&s;tian Part of the World, than ever it did among the Heathen, and has almo&s;t in all Places <HI>among them,</HI> been the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>I need not go to Sacred Writ for the Perjury, or wor&s;e, of <HI>Jacob</HI> to <HI>E&s;au;</HI> Breach of Honour in <HI>David</HI> to the Po&s;terity of <HI>Jonathan, and the like;</HI> &s;ince they have Exceptious in them, which, per|haps, we cannot &s;o well di&s;cant upon in this Place.</P>
<P>I need not dwell upon the <HI>Mahometans</HI> making a Je&s;t of <HI>Keeping Faith with Chri&s;tians;</HI> &s;ince we find <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> making the &s;ame Je&s;t of <HI>Keeping Oaths to to tho&s;e they call</HI> Hereticks <HI>and</HI> Phanaticks, and that in <HI>Rome, France, Italy,</HI> and <HI>England;</HI> it has been the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>What need I examine the JEST which Princes have made in the World, of their <HI>Swearing</HI> to Treaties and Capitulations. The Oaths, <HI>Anglice, JESTS</HI> of Renunciations of Right and Di&s;claim|ing Succe&s;&s;ions.&mdash;The BANTER of Oaths call'd Coronation-Oaths to Subjects, and the like, the&s;e are &s;o Subjects, and the like, the&s;e are &s;o flagrant they need no Repetition and that they <HI>&s;ignify nothing,</HI> has long been allow'd in <HI>France</HI> and <HI>El&s;ewhere,</HI> to be the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="8">
Nor need I go far, to &s;hew you the general Oaths taken by conquer'd Cities and Provinces, to the re&s;pective Conquerors <HI>Alternately</HI> as they &s;ubdu'd them. Nor the JESTING, I mean, <HI>Swearing</HI> of Nations to Princes, whom they think fit afterwards <HI>Nationally</HI> to Re&s;i&s;t, and Depo&s;e; &s;ince their NON-SIGNIFICATION has on all Oc|ca&s;ions appear'd to be the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>After all the&s;e will you any longer que&s;tion, that the Swearing, Fore-Swearing, or Back-Swearing; <HI>i. e.</HI> Abjuring of Parties, can be any more than JESTING; that it can be taken for any other by the Princes to whom, or meant for any other with the Parties by whom they are taken; and that their being taken for a Je&s;t, is now become the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>What is that we call CUSTOM, but the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI> Or, The common Acceptat on, in which, &s;uch, and &s;uch Things are generally re|ceived; and by which, the Signification, or Non-Signification of what is &s;aid, or done, is under|&s;tood in General.</P>
<P>Let's begin with what we call common Conver|&s;ation, <HI>Here</HI> CUSTOM, which I thus call the <HI>Sence of the Nation,</HI> has commanded that we &s;hould under&s;tand SWEARING to be really no le&s;s than JESTING, and when a Man wi&s;hes <HI>God may Damn him,</HI> or <HI>&s;top his Vitals;</HI> when he Cur&s;es <HI>his Blood,</HI> and &s;wears <HI>By his Maker,</HI> or <HI>Redeemer;</HI> it is ex|pected, in good Manners, you &s;hould under&s;tand him to mean <HI>Nothing at all,</HI> and 'tis plain, he is &s;o under&s;tood in the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>God forbid, we &s;hou'd be &s;o barbarous and in|humane, to take Men <HI>Literally</HI> when they &s;wear, or to charge them with <HI>Meaning</HI> when they bla&s;|pheme God, <HI>damn them&s;elves,</HI> and &s;wear &s;olemnly to what they &s;ay; this wou'd be the unrea&s;onable&s;t
<PB N="8" REF="9">
Thing in the World, and you mu&s;t then charge them with Perjury a Thou&s;and Times a Day. The Ca&s;e is plain, you mu&s;t refer to the great Law of Cu&s;tom, which is <HI>The Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>This Cu&s;tom governs Kingdoms as well as <HI>Men,</HI> and directs you to take all the Imprecations and Execrations of the Common Conver&s;ation of Men <HI>to &s;ignify nothing at all;</HI> as Froth upon your Drink, which proceeds from its Strength, but when you skim it off, the pure Liquor comes after; &s;o this Swearing is nothing but a certain Froth or Foam of the Mouth proceeding from the Heat of the Pa&s;&s;ions, which Men throw by and take for no|thing, and Skimming it off from Speech, the true Genuine Sence of the Man comes after it: And thus it is generally taken in the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>From hence it follows, That a Man &s;hall &s;wear a Thou&s;and <HI>Street-Oaths</HI> in an Hour, to the Truth of a Thing <HI>which he knows nothing of,</HI> or to do &s;ome|thing <HI>he never intends,</HI> or that he did &s;omething <HI>he never thought of,</HI> and yet remain a Man of Ho|nour; if you bring him upon his Oath in a Court of Ju&s;tice, or make him a Witne&s;s between Man and Man, you may depend upon his Evidence to be Punctual and True, and he &s;corns to for|&s;wear him&s;elf: Nay, he &s;hall pa&s;s for a good Wit|ne&s;s, notwith&s;tanding his daily Perjury, <HI>in the Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>The Rea&s;on is plain, <HI>Cu&s;tom</HI> has pre&s;erv'd &s;ome Veneration to a Formal Oath in Bearing Witne&s;s, but <HI>The Sence of the Nation</HI> has long &s;ince taken away all Signification from the mo&s;t violent Oaths in the World in common Speech, as Things that neither are intended, or &s;hou'd be under&s;tood to have any Kind of Meaning at all in them. <HI>H</HI>&mdash;is an Eminent Ju&s;tice of Peace, he puni&s;hes Drunkenne&s;s, Whoring and Swearing impartially, as the Law directs, and when a Man is brought
<PB N="9" REF="10">
before him for the&s;e Crimes, he decently ex|horts him to forbear; but he &s;wears and bla&s;|phemes in the very Act of Executing the Law upon them, and damns him&s;elf upon the very Bench. The Ca&s;e is plain, It is all without any Signification, nay, it is not to be call'd Speech, but a certain Excrement of the Pa&s;&s;ions which breaks out at the Mouth; it has a kind of Sound, indeed, like Words, but it is hardly known by <HI>the Parties them&s;elves;</HI> it has no Communica|tion with the Thoughts, and cannot be under|&s;tood to have any Meaning at all; like the <HI>Igni fatui</HI> in the Air, which have an Appearance of Fire, and give a kind of Light, or rather, a &s;hining Reflection of Light, but have no Heat, and are e&s;teem'd as a meer Vapour, without any Signification.</P>
<P>We might enter into the General Examina|tion here, of the Manners of the Age, and we &s;hou'd find, that it is the mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary Thing in the World, that Cu&s;tom &s;hou'd allow Men to go on in a Method of Speaking without Signification.&mdash;That Abundance of the mo&s;t Common Part of Humane Conver&s;ation &s;hou'd be interlac'd with the&s;e Non-Entities in Speech: That as they are Ornaments in Style, and U&s;eful Articles in Founding the mo&s;t E&s;&s;ential Parts of Speaking, we cannot be without them.&mdash;<HI>The Rea&s;on is,</HI> Long Experience has found it nece&s;&s;ary, and they are thus under&s;tood in the <HI>Sence of the Nation:</HI> More particularly, In <HI>Friend&s;hip,</HI> in <HI>Keep|ing Secrets,</HI> in <HI>Treaties of Accommodation,</HI> in <HI>Recon|ciliations of Differences,</HI> in <HI>Acknowledging Obligations,</HI> in <HI>Prote&s;tations of Gratitude,</HI> in <HI>New Acquaintan|ces,</HI> in <HI>Seeking Favours,</HI> but above all, in <HI>Matters of Love, Gallantry,</HI> and <HI>Paying of Debts:</HI> I &s;ay, long Experience has found, that <HI>Oaths, A&s;&s;evera|tions,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="11">
and the <HI>Deepe&s;t Imprecations,</HI> without the lea&s;t Intent or Meaning either to keep or break them, mu&s;t be made U&s;e of in &s;uch Things as the&s;e.&mdash;They are thought nece&s;&s;ary to <HI>fill up</HI> the Vacancies of Elocution, <HI>&s;upply</HI> the Defect of Language, <HI>a&s;&s;i&s;t</HI> the Pa&s;&s;ions, appear <HI>in&s;tead</HI> of Sincerity, <HI>and the like;</HI> in all which 'tis not at all requi&s;ite, that any manner of Meaning &s;hou'd go along with them.</P>
<P>There are innumerable Examples to illu&s;trate this,&mdash;and many a Votary to a Party has left us their Dying Te&s;timony of it <HI>at the Gallows,</HI> of which <HI>Coleman</HI> was a Famous In&s;tance in the la&s;t Age,&mdash;has been &s;o in this, and <HI>F&V;LLER,</HI> they &s;ay, is a living Witne&s;s a|gain&s;t Dr. <HI>Sacheverell</HI> for the like.</P>
<P>To bring it home to our Point, Cu&s;tom hav|ing thus legitimated this Practice, and <HI>Swearing</HI> and <HI>Je&s;ting</HI> being the &s;ame Thing in the <HI>Sence of the Nation,</HI>&mdash;It &s;eems &s;trange, that our fooli&s;h People &s;hould object again&s;t the Incon&s;i&s;tency of any Part of our Modern Oaths, I mean, in Publick Matters, <HI>&s;uch as,</HI> of <HI>Merchants</HI> taking Cu&s;tom-Hou&s;e Oaths, which are become in&s;igni|ficant to a Proverb; <HI>Citizens</HI> taking the Oath of a Freeman, which 'tis impo&s;&s;ible for &s;ome of them to keep; <HI>A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors</HI> and <HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners in Taxes</HI> take Oaths, which they never think of again. Men <HI>&s;wear off</HI> Taxes, <HI>&s;wear to</HI> Accounts, and <HI>&s;wear</HI> upon Juries; <HI>&s;wear</HI> when they <HI>go into</HI> Offices, and <HI>&s;wear</HI> when they <HI>go out;</HI> &s;wear <HI>to the</HI> QUEEN, and &s;wear <HI>at the</HI> QUEEN;&mdash;and what is all this, but to tell us, that Cu&s;tom has taken off the Sanction of Oaths, and e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd this for a Law, That <HI>You are to take them,</HI> ju&s;t as they that &s;wear them, <HI>mean them,</HI> viz. <HI>for nothing at all.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
From Oaths to Men, let us come to the Oath of God, aud &s;ee if that has any greater Force, we &s;ee it <HI>how corruptly &s;oever</HI> of late de|&s;cended to &s;erve Parties and publick Intere&s;ts, and therefore, <HI>contrary to its In&s;titution,</HI> plac'd as a Te&s;t of Civil Di&s;tinction, a Key, <HI>the De|vil, they &s;ay, has the Lock,</HI> to Civil Preferments, an Introduction to publick Employment, a Sup|port to Parties, and a Property to Hypocrites; and what's the Language of all this, but that it really <HI>&s;ignifies Nothing,</HI>&mdash;is receiv'd with|out <HI>Thinking,</HI> admini&s;ter'd without <HI>Meaning,</HI> and &s;tands for a Cypher.</P>
<P>And now Good People, having laid down this New Sy&s;tem in all our Politicks, it is, as I &s;aid before to you, <HI>a Test</HI> of its U&s;efulne&s;s: <HI>Thus,</HI> By this Philo&s;ophy we can &s;olve all the &s;trange <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in our Politicks, which have &s;o long puzzl'd our People, nd laid &s;tumbling Blocks in the Way of Hone&s;t Men. <HI>For Example,</HI></P>
<P>By this is made clear the Difficulty of Peoples <HI>Swearing</HI> to the Government, and Abjuring the Pretender, and yet <HI>Acting for</HI> his Intere&s;t, <HI>Drink|ing his Health,</HI> and Owning him as their Sove|reign.</P>
<P>By this is reconcil'd the Difficulty of the Mayor and Magi&s;trates of <HI>M</HI>&mdash;bearing the Sword and Mace of Queen ANNE, and being Her Humble Servants all the Week, and yet going in their Formalities every Sabbath-Day to the <HI>Jacobite</HI> Meeting-Hou&s;e, where they pray Openly for the Re&s;toration of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> whom they have Abjur'd.</P>
<P>By this is reconcil'd Damming the Tollera|tion, and yet not blaming the Indulgence to Tender Con&s;ciences.</P>
<P>By this is made clear the Con&s;i&s;tency of
<PB N="12" REF="13">
the Doctrine of Hereditary Right, and Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, with the Act of Succe&s;&s;ion, and the Revolution, and as I &s;aid before, many other <HI>Phaenomena,</HI> which, in them&s;elves admit of no Demon&s;tration.</P>
<P><HI>C&V;STOM</HI> has declar'd, that all tho&s;e <HI>Poli|tick Oaths</HI> are taken as having no Significa|tion; That we are to under&s;tand them, and the Takers of them to have <HI>no Meaning at all,</HI> and that they pa&s;s for Nothing; this being the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>On the&s;e Accounts they cannot be &s;aid to deceive us, for that we have nothing more to expect from them, than we ought to ex|pect from People, that &s;wear <HI>without Meaning,</HI> and look upon Oaths to have <HI>no Signification.</HI></P>
<P>It cannot be forgotten here, that this re|conciles the Endeavours &s;ome People u&s;e, as expect the Overthrow of the Tolleration, the Rupture of the Union, and the Di&s;&s;olving the E&s;tabli&s;h'd Succe&s;&s;ion, notwith&s;tanding her Ma|je&s;ty's Sacred Promi&s;e frequently given from the Throne to Support, and Defend them, and to Maintain the fir&s;t of them inviolably.</P>
<P>It is evident, the&s;e Gentlemen take all the&s;e Sacred Pledges of Honour given by Her Maje&s;ty, to be like their own Swearing,&mdash;<HI>viz.</HI> to be taken for <HI>NOTHING,</HI> to have no Manner of Signification, &s;o to be meant at fir&s;t, <HI>and at la&s;t;</HI>&mdash;and that this is the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>It is farther evident, <HI>that</HI> in their Offering to put the Queen's Undoubted Title to the Crown, upon Her Maje&s;ty's Hereditary, not Parliamen|tary Right; at the &s;ame Time offering no|thing again&s;t the Legitimacy of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> they wou'd have Her Maje&s;ty believe, Her ha|ving

<HI>NO RIGHT AT ALL,</HI> is the <HI>Sence of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e <HI>Phaenomena</HI> in our Politick Philo&s;ophy, are &s;olv'd very readily by this Doctrine of the Sovereignty of Cu&s;tom, to e&s;tabli&s;h the Mean|ing, or No-Meaning of Speech, and to legiti|mate the No-Meaning of the mo&s;t Solemn Ac|tions in the World.</P>
<P>This brings us down to the mo&s;t clear De|mon&s;tration, that any Man can de&s;ire of &s;uch a new advanc'd Sy&s;tem, and I &s;hall bring you abundant Te&s;timony from all Parts of this Na|tion, when in their mo&s;t Solemn Applications to their Princes, the Good People of <HI>England</HI> have no other Te&s;timony of their Sincerity and Hone&s;ty, either to God, their Sovereign, or them&s;elves, than that they had no Mean|ing at all in what they &s;aid.</P>
<P>This is to be found, or, at lea&s;t, to be &s;earch'd for in the Famous Addre&s;&s;es, which upon &s;undry Occa&s;ions have been pre&s;ented to our Princes from the Good People of <HI>England;</HI> particularly tho&s;e in the late King <HI>Jame</HI>'s Time, upon the Subject of the Birth of the <HI>Pretender,</HI> the taking off the Penal Laws and Te&s;t, and the bringing <HI>Papi&s;ts</HI> into Employment; not ex|cluding &s;ome now pre&s;ented, and pre&s;enting to Her Maje&s;ty, by &s;everal Sorts of People, on the Behalf of the Corrupted Doctrines of <HI>Here|ditary Right, Non-Re&s;i&s;tance,</HI> Di&s;&s;olving <HI>Parlia|ments,</HI> &amp;c.</P>
<P>Perhaps &s;ome People may alledge, that there has been a little Meaning in the Heads of the People in the&s;e Ca&s;es. But as &s;uch pretending Advocates will be brought to acknowledge <HI>tho&s;e Meanings,</HI> to be ab&s;urd Contradictions to one another; incon&s;i&s;tent with Honour&punc; Liberty, Con|&s;titution
<PB N="14" REF="15">
and Religion; and particularly, the Sorts of Addre&s;&s;es <HI>One with Another;</HI> I cannot but think the kinde&s;t as well as ea&s;ie&s;t to be demon&s;trated Truth <HI>we can &s;ay of them is,</HI> that they had no Meaning at all; that they were de&s;ign'd by them&s;elves to pa&s;s for nothing, <HI>re|ceiv'd &s;o by their Princes,</HI> and that this Opi|nion of them has always been the <HI>Sen&s;e of the Nation.</HI></P>
<P>However that any One may enter into the Enquiry, and tell us what they think: Whe|ther it can be po&s;&s;ible the People cou'd mean any Thing in the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es; and if they had any Meaning <HI>what it was:</HI> I &s;hall pre&s;ent the Reader with a few of both the Kinds, &s;et One again&s;t Another;&mdash;As to the <HI>Meaning</HI> or <HI>No-Meaning</HI> of the fir&s;t Parcel, I &s;hall evidence what I alledge, of their having been de&s;ign'd <HI>to pa&s;s for nothing</HI> by their Authors from the Con&s;equences. As to the &s;econd Sort, I &s;hall leave them to the <HI>Sence of the Nation,</HI> to judge them by their Probability.</P>
<P>In my Opinion, Time has made it appear, that Addre&s;&s;ing in King <HI>Jame</HI>'s Time, had no Meaning at all, other than a meer <HI>Pulling off the Cap,</HI> which we do to any Body we meet, with <HI>Your Servant Mr. Such a One,</HI> which really pa&s;&s;es for ju&s;t nothing at all; for if the Man was to go to the <HI>Gallows</HI> the next Day, you have nothing to &s;ay to him.&mdash;So it was the Fa&s;hion ju&s;t then, to &s;ay any Thing which they thought <HI>their Prince wou'd be pleas'd with;</HI> to do any Thing he bid them; to thank him for every Thing he did, whether for or again&s;t them.&mdash;As to Liberty, Priviledges, Laws, Prote&s;tant Religion, and &s;uch like Things, they never troubled their Heads with them, nor

cou'd without <HI>infinite Scandal to their Sences,</HI> be &s;aid to have any Meaning at all about them&mdash;Thus they thank him for His <HI>Standing Army,</HI> tho' they knew it was rais'd to en&s;lave them; for His <HI>Di&s;pen&s;ing Declaration,</HI> tho' they knew it trampled upon the Laws: They &s;acrific'd the <HI>Penal Laws</HI> and <HI>Test,</HI> tho' it was evident, it was in Favour of <HI>Papists</HI> only: And they pro|mis'd for their <HI>Parliament Men</HI> that they &s;hou'd in all Things comply with His De&s;ires, tho' that mu&s;t effectually de&s;troy the very Being of Par|liaments.</P>
<P>After all the&s;e Fine Words, the&s;e very Ad|dre&s;&s;ors never perform'd one of the&s;e Things, and the kinde&s;t Thing I can &s;ay of them is, <HI>that they never intended it.</HI>&mdash;Not that I am reproaching them at all for Cheats and Hy|pocrites, that wheedled and deluded their Princes, <HI>as I know &s;ome do;</HI> that fir&s;t made him believe they wou'd be <HI>ridden</HI> into any Thing, that they wou'd <HI>&s;ubmit</HI> to any Thing, wou'd have been <HI>as pa&s;&s;ive</HI> as they talk'd of, and wou'd really &s;ubject them&s;elves, their Liberties, Laws and Religion to His Ab&s;olute Will: <HI>No, No!</HI> The good People were hone&s;ter than &s;o.&mdash;The <HI>Error lay here;</HI> the Thing was a cu&s;tomary Piece of Extravagance, and the King took them to be in Earne&s;t.&mdash;<HI>Sir, Your most Obedient Ser|vant,</HI> &s;ays a Man to me in the Street; if I &s;hou'd bid him go of an Errand for me, he wou'd an&s;wer, <HI>What, Sir, do you take me for a Porter!

<P>Now, if the&s;e Gentlemen &s;hou'd be under&s;tood to mean &s;uch Sort of Loyalty as this of their An|ce&s;tors, it wou'd lye very hard upon their Re|putation; without Doubt, it would be much more for their Honour to believe, that they, like the re&s;t of their Brethren Addre&s;&s;ors, <HI>Mean</HI> NO|THING AT ALL, and de&s;ign'd Her Maje&s;ty &s;hould under&s;tand them &s;o.</P>

<P N="1">1. What Coherence, or Agreement has the &s;aid Addre&s;s with the general Bent of their Sermons, and the Language of the Pulpit in the Churches of this City? and with the Ser|mons afterward printed, in which, the Ille|gality of Re&s;i&s;tance, even of Arbitrary Power it &s;elf, is &s;o &s;trenuou&s;ly a&s;&s;erted, that one would have thought it impo&s;&s;ible, the &s;ame Clergy, when in a Body, could &s;o directly contradict in their collective Sen&s;e, what they had &s;aid in their &s;eperate Stations in the Pul|pit?&mdash;Dr. <HI>Higgins,</HI> Mr. <HI>Hillia&mdash;d,</HI> Mr. <HI>Mil|bourn,</HI> and others, are Eminent Witne&s;&s;es to the Doctrine of Non-Re&s;i&s;tance, and yet here they are for ble&s;&s;ing God, for their having &s;uc|ce&s;sfully put the contrary in Practice.</P>
<P>If this can be accounted for upon any Foundation, other than that of having <HI>No Meaning,</HI> we would be glad to hear it.</P>
<P>It is true, here may ari&s;e a Di&s;pute, whe|ther the Gentlemen may not be &s;aid to have &s;ome Meaning in one, and none in the other; <HI>viz.</HI> &s;ome Meaning in their Sermons, and none in their Addre&s;&s;es; or &s;ome Meaning in their Addre&s;&s;es, and none in their Sermons.
<PB N="62" REF="63">
But we are loth to have this Point debated, becau&s;e they may run the Ri&s;que of being found, to have no Meaning in either; or if not, it may be wor&s;e; <HI>viz.</HI> that the Meaning lyes in the Addre&s;s, and not in the Sermon, and that when they came together, (like <HI>Balaam)</HI> they <HI>went with a wicked De&s;ign to cur&s;e</HI> I&s;rael, but were forced by the over-ruling Spirit of God to ble&s;s them: So that they had de&s;ign'd to have talk'd their old Jargon, and really began it, when they told the Queen, Her Maje&s;ty's <HI>Authority was Irre&s;i|stible.</HI>&mdash;But Truth prevailing, they were forced by an involuntary &s;ecret Con&s;traint <HI>from Hea|ven,</HI> to pay their Homage to the Con&s;titu|tion, and not only recognize the Ju&s;tice of With&s;tanding their Prince, but boa&s;t of the Practice, and engage them&s;elves to continue in it.</P>
<P>How el&s;e could tho&s;e Mini&s;ters &s;et their Hands to this Addre&s;s, and wait upon the Queen with it, ki&s;s Her Maje&s;ty's Hand, &amp;c. who have from the Pulpit told us it was a Dam|nable, Heretical, Republican, Schi&s;matical Te|net, that Subjects might re&s;i&s;t their Sovereign, upon any Pretence what&s;oever.</P>
<P>This Way of taking it, therefore, being much more to the Di&s;advantage of our Friends, the Clergy of <HI>London:</HI> It &s;eems much kinder, and more to their Advantage, to prove, that in all the&s;e Things (as before) they have not been in the lea&s;t inrected with any Meaning at all:</P>
<P N="2">2. But another Que&s;tion falls in here, to which, in Point of Reputation, and for the Honour of the Clergy, &s;omething &s;hould be &s;aid, (to wit) where the Manners and good Breeding of put|ting the&s;e Things upon the Queen is to be found?</P>
<P><PB N="63" REF="64">
But this is an&s;wer'd &s;everal Ways, it is true, all rea&s;onable ju&s;t Deference and Re&s;pect, is in Duty to be paid to the Queen, the Head of this Great Body, and e&s;pecially, as Her Ma|je&s;ty has been the Great, and Liberal Bene|factor to the Clergy; and, no Doubt, the Gen|tlemen of the Clergy have a very great Sen&s;e of Duty and Regard in this Ca&s;e:&mdash;But the Duty and Regard to our Sovereign however great, is no where &s;uppo&s;ed to exceed our Du|ty and Reverence to God Him&s;elf, who is &s;till &s;uperior, not only to the Queen, but to all the Kings and Queens on Earth.</P>
<P>Now the Queen can by no Means take it ill, tho' it &s;hou'd appear Her Maje&s;ty has been a little trifl'd with, &s;ince the &s;ame Treatment has by the &s;ame Per&s;ons been given ev'n to God Him&s;elf,&mdash;and this many Ways; &s;uch as Preaching up the <HI>Jus Divinum</HI> of the Line of Princes, the inherent Right of the Per&s;on of the King, the Superiority of a Tyrant to the Law, and the Authority of Temporal Power over the Con&s;cience.&mdash;Such is the ab&s;olute Subjection of Subjects to the Lu&s;t, and Fury of the mo&s;t Wicked and Athei&s;tical Princes; and the like; Things that are all but Je&s;ts in their own Nature, and in venting which in the Pulpit, they know they in&s;ult Heaven, re|proach Religion, and banter their Maker.</P>
<P>Now, the Queen cannot expect they &s;hou'd treat Her better than they do the King of Kings; or, that Her Maje&s;ty &s;hou'd be above their Mockery, when their Maker is not. It is evident, that in all their Pretences to ab|&s;olute Subjection, they have banter'd both God and their Kings. Poor King <HI>James</HI> found it to his De&s;truction, &s;ince none were &s;o forward
<PB N="64" REF="65">
vigorou&s;ly to with&s;tand his Arbitrary Govern|ment, as tho&s;e that prompted him to that ve|ry Lawle&s;s Power <HI>(hoping to have a Share in it)</HI> upon their Faithle&s;s Promi&s;es of Submitting to it.</P>
<P>But if Her Maje&s;ty &s;hou'd, notwith&s;tanding this, take it ill, that the&s;e Gentlemen u&s;e Her thus, there is another Thing to be &s;po|ken in their Favour, which is hoped may be accepted as an Excu&s;e; <HI>viz.</HI> That it has been the known U&s;age, and Cu&s;tom of Addre&s;&s;ing,&mdash;and that 'tis hoped Her Maje&s;ty will not re|&s;ent it, &s;ince it has of old, even from the Days of Her Royal Uncle, and Father, been the Practi&s;e of the&s;e People, to talk a Lan|guage in their Addre&s;&s;es, on which no Reliance can be made, and to which no Heed &s;hou'd be given.&mdash;That Her Maje&s;ty's Ance&s;tors have been us'd thus all along, but never thought fit to re&s;ent it:&mdash;And &s;o it may be hoped, the Goodne&s;s and Mercy of this Reign will bear with the Follies, which have &s;o long a Pre&s;cription to plead for the Practice.</P>
<P>To make it out, that there is abundant Occa&s;ion for the Royal Forbearance, I &s;hall give but one In&s;tance more than what is al|ready noted, and that is in the following Addre&s;s from <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> which, I &s;hall give you at large, becau&s;e it merits more than Common Notice, and &s;eems to be the only Addre&s;s, that has any Meaning in it.</P>

Now of all the Addre&s;&s;es that have been pre&s;ented to the Queen this is the merrye&s;t; whether you compare it with it &s;elf, or with o|ther Addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>To compare it with it &s;elf, it tells you, That the Repre&s;entation giv'n of them in the Late Letters were <HI>fal&s;e and groundle&s;s;</HI> Fir&s;t, that it traduc'd divers of Her Maje&s;ty's Faithful Sub|jects with the Promoting Tumults; and then goes on to &s;ay, this was <HI>Maliciou&s;ly compos'd to draw down the Queen's Di&s;plea&s;ure;</HI> upon who? upon <HI>&V;S,</HI> &s;ays the Paper: Now who are the&s;e <HI>&V;S?</HI> If they are the People before-nam'd, that, 'tis depos'd upon Oath, did attempt to rai&s;e Tumults; what merry Fellows they are, to come to the Queen with their &s;ingle Nega|tive again&s;t the Affidavits &s;ent up, with the Truth of which Her Maje&s;ty was &s;o well &s;a|tisfy'd, and which be&s;ides was atte&s;ted by Ten Gentlemen, who&s;e Names we have at the End of the Repre&s;entation afore&s;aid.</P>
<P>Again, If this Addre&s;s is done by the &s;ame Parties that were accus'd before, then why do they not clear them&s;elves, of the Charge of Clan|de&s;tine Procuring Hands to an Addre&s;s, by Go|ing up and down in the Night to get Hands, after the Grand-Jury was di&s;charg'd; of this they do not think fit to &s;ay one Word, and con&s;equently do not deny the Fact in the lea&s;t.</P>
<P>But if they are not the &s;ame People, then how does this mighty <HI>&V;S</HI> come in:&mdash;This is &s;ad Stuff to come from a County, and &s;tands upon Record again&s;t their Wor&s;hips being in their Sences, at the Time of their Framing this Addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Well, tho' they do &s;eem to allow this Charge, and that they did go about Clande&s;tinely, to

get a Former Addre&s;s &s;ign'd in the dark, know|ing, that as a Body, it con'd not be obtain'd; yet <HI>they are clear in this,</HI>&mdash;and <HI>how do they think to &s;atisfy Her Maje&s;ty, that they are &s;o clear;</HI> why, truly, by Telling Her Maje&s;ty they will elect <HI>&s;uch</HI> and <HI>&s;uch</HI> for Parliament Men. This is &s;uch a Demon&s;tration, as no doubt, Her Maje&s;ty will be &s;atisfy'd of when She &s;ees it:&mdash;And what are they, that they will elect?

<P>Now can the&s;e People <HI>MEAN?</HI> Would it not be Horrid Non&s;ence, to &s;uppo&s;e &s;uch Stuff as this can have <HI>any Meaning?</HI> Nothing, but the Certainty of their having <HI>No Meaning</HI> can make the Thing tolerable; or excu&s;e them in good Manners.&mdash;Ble&s;s us! That People &s;hou'd talk thus to the Queen, and Printing it afterwards talk it to the World.&mdash;</P>
<P>And is this the Proof, that their Addre&s;s was not Clande&s;tinely obtain'd! Is this all they have to &s;ay upon that Head? We &s;hall &s;ee what will be the Weight of this Proof, when their Repre&s;entatives come up.&mdash;I dare &s;ay, neither of their Knights of the Shire, let them choo&s;e who they will, can have the good Coun|tenance to &s;ay in the Parliament-Hou&s;e, <HI>That</HI>
<PB N="75" REF="76">
<HI>they are come up to act with an</HI> Unlimited Obe|dience <HI>to Her Maje&s;ty.</HI> It is not Parliament Language; it does not &s;uit with the U&s;age of the Crown it &s;elf; ev'n the Queen Her Self, does not &s;eek &s;uch Obedience from any of her People, nor can ju&s;t Monarchs accept it.&mdash;But to talk of <HI>&V;nlimited Obedience,</HI> and then add to it <HI>Liberties</HI> and <HI>Franchi&s;es,</HI> this is &s;uch Stuff!&mdash;Alas!

<P>But <HI>now,</HI> bring them among their Neighbours, and only acknowledge for them that they had <HI>no Meaning,</HI> you bring them off <HI>as round as a Hoop,</HI> and they may tell you boldly, they are no greater&mdash;s than their Brethren.</P>
<P>It wou'd be endle&s;s, to go thro' with all the Non&s;ence and Incon&s;i&s;tency, that the&s;e Gentle|men fill up the&s;e Things call'd <HI>Addre&s;&s;es</HI> with. The great U&s;e I &s;hall make of them is, that you may &s;ee the Doctrine of <HI>Non-Re&s;istance</HI> is in it &s;elf &s;o ridiculous, &s;o &s;elf-contradicting, &s;o in|con&s;i&s;tent, that the Wi&s;e&s;t Men in the Na|tion cannot put it together, &s;o as to make it &s;peak Sence.&mdash;They that in other Ca&s;es &s;peak clear and explicite, that are Ma&s;ters of the Tongue, and other Tongues too; that write a Fluent, Ea&s;y, Copious Stile, Strong in Sence, Flowing in Eloquence, and Rich in the Beau|ties of Conception, when they come to this, when they have the&s;e Incongruities to put to|gether, how do they chew it, and mumble it
<PB N="76" REF="77">
like an A&s;s upon Thi&s;tles; and when it is di|ge&s;ted with all the Art and Cunning they can employ upon it; behold it comes out mo&s;t In|comprehen&s;ible Non&s;ence.</P>
<P>This Doctrine needs no Application.&mdash;It may &s;erve for an In&s;truction to the World, in the Difficult Work of Defending the&s;e Gen|tlemen in their Common Conver&s;ation; <HI>viz.</HI> That the good People <HI>mean nothing at all,</HI> and con&s;equently can mean no Harm.</P>
<P>And now can any Man do better, than to recommend to the Good People of <HI>England,</HI> the Choo&s;ing their Repre&s;entatives out of the&s;e hone&s;t <HI>Nothing-Meaning</HI> Gentlemen, That we may have a Parliament of &s;uch Men, who will act by an <HI>&V;nlimited Limited Obedience,</HI> and <HI>re&s;i&s;t Irre&s;i&s;tible Authority:</HI> No Que&s;tion it wou'd be much for the Advantage of the Kingdom at &s;uch a Time as this, that the Enemy may be effectually reduc'd, the War vigorou&s;ly carry'd on, and <HI>France</HI> gallantly beaten; for Fools, they &s;ay, always fight de&s;perately, and no Men have more Courage than &s;ome of tho&s;e that never think.</P>
<P>But after all, when we come to con&s;ider more &s;eriou&s;ly, we cannot but put the Good People in Mind, that the&s;e are not the People that will do their Bu&s;ine&s;s.&mdash;Men to repre|&s;ent their Country, and to &s;erve Her Maje&s;ty in Parliament, mu&s;t be Men of Meaning, Men of Sence, Men of Abilities of Mind, Men of Moderation, Men of Temper.</P>
<P>Men, that know how to give a due Obe|dience, and pay all the ju&s;t Duty of faithful Subjects; but yet know how to maintain, and pre&s;erve the Liberties of their Country; that know how to keep both the Prerogative of the
<PB N="77" REF="78">
Sovereign, and the Priviledges of the Subject in a due Con&s;i&s;tency one with another, that both may flouri&s;h, and be maintain'd in their full Vigour, and a due State of Health, that will neither trample upon the Crown, nor give up the Con&s;titution. The&s;e are the Men, that we &s;hould recommend to the Free-Holders at this Time, that would heal, and re&s;tore this divided, di&s;tracted People.</P>
<P>Nor is this Advice contrary to the Mean|ing, and true De&s;ign of Her Maje&s;ty in this Di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P>The Queen de&s;ires to have &s;uch Men &s;ent up, Men of Temper and Moderation, Men of Probity and Honour, Men, that would cool our Heats, and remove the Cau&s;e of our Breaches, that the Effect may cea&s;e of cour&s;e. I may venture freely to &s;ay, whoever thinks Her Maje&s;ty de&s;ires a Parliament hot, reveng|ful, quarrel&s;ome and furious, they mi&s;take Her Royal De&s;ign, and in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Manner vilify and abu&s;e their Sovereign.</P>
<P>Nor can the New Mini&s;try, which are now put into the Publick Offices of Tru&s;t, be &s;up|po&s;ed to de&s;ire it; Fools, or Mad-Men will by no Means do their Work, it mu&s;t be Men of Sen&s;e, Men of Temper, and Men of Con|duct, that mu&s;t &s;upport the Government, and mu&s;t &s;upport them in the Admini&s;tration of it. The&s;e only can prevent the wild Ex|treams, that &s;ome People are driving at.</P>
<P>Thus, the Queen, the New Mini&s;try, the Old Mini&s;try, and indeed, all hone&s;t Men a|gree in this, that the Intere&s;t of the Free-Holders of <HI>England</HI> at this Time, and indeed, at all Times, is to be repre&s;ented by wi&s;e, &s;o|ber, judicious Men, who&s;e Zeal is temper'd, and

guided by Knowledge, Wi&s;dom and Love to their Country, who&s;e Moderation is di&s;tingui&s;h'd upon known Occa&s;ions, as who are qualify'd to cool, and re&s;tore our Native Country over|whelmed with Faction, and Furious Parties.</P>
<P>Let &s;uch Men be &s;ent to repre&s;ent us, and no Matter who comes in, or goes out of Places; the Queen will be enabled to act vigorou&s;ly, and coun&s;elled wi&s;ely; and this is the Way to make us all happy.</P>
<P>All the re&s;t tends to Confu&s;ion and Di&s;order, and mu&s;t end in the De&s;truction not of the Na|tion's Peace only, but the Nation it &s;elf; mu&s;t ruin the Con&s;titution, ruin the Queen, ruin the Subject, tends directly to the bringing in <HI>French</HI> Power upon us, and with it a Popi&s;h Pretender.</P>

<HEAD>Po&s;t&s;cript.</HEAD>
<P>THE foregoing Sheets are the natural Con|&s;equences of a mo&s;t confu&s;ed Heap of ri|diculous Non&s;ence, the Effect of much Con|fu&s;ion, which appears to be now on the Face of Things in this Nation.</P>
<P>What has been &s;aid is Ironical, and the true De&s;ign of it all, is to let us &s;ee, that really this tumultuous Way of Mobbing our Gover|nours by Addre&s;&s;es, has no Manner of Good in it, but a great deal of Evil; and that as well to the Party they would &s;erve, as to the Party they would oppo&s;e.</P>
<P>They are agreeable to no ju&s;t Government, as well, becau&s;e of the Feuds and Divi&s;ions they make in the Towns and Counties they come from, as becau&s;e of the little Depen|dance that is to be had upon them, the Per&s;ons addre&s;&s;ing having &s;eldom, if ever, been known to have the lea&s;t Regard to them, when any pre&s;&s;ing Occa&s;ion has given the Prince Rea&s;on to expect it, as is fre&s;h in our Memories in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Richard Cromwell,</HI> King <HI>Charles</HI> the Second, and King <HI>James:</HI></P>
<P>If our Princes have depended upon this Me|thod, they have been not mi&s;taken only, but mi&s;taken to their Hurt, as King <HI>James,</HI> without Doubt, was in a more particular Manner.</P>
<P>Again, They are generally worded in &s;o ex|travagant a Manner, either &s;o &s;urfeiting in Flat|tery,
<PB N="80" REF="81">
&s;o wild in Profe&s;&s;ions of Duty, &s;o provo|king upon the contrary Party, &s;o ill worded in Matters of Law, and &s;ometimes in Sence, that 'tis a hard Matter for the Prince, tho' He may like the Zeal of His Subject's Addre&s;&s;ing, ever to forbear, either Smiling at the Extravagance, or Frowning at the Arrogance of the Addre&s;s it &s;elf.</P>
<P>I cannot from hence but give it as my Opi|nion, that had Her Maje&s;ty been asked, or, had any of Her Royal Predece&s;&s;ors been asked, their Opinion of the Cu&s;tom of Addre&s;&s;ing, e&s;pecially as it hath been u&s;ed in this Kingdom for &s;ome Years pa&s;t, They would unanimou&s;ly have an|&s;wer'd, They &s;hould be as well plea&s;ed it were all let alone.</P>
<P>If it could be done with Unanimity of Coun|cil, and in Friendly Terms by the People, with Peace among them&s;elves, Duty to their Sove|reign, and due Regard to Bounds, in the Man|ner; It would be agreeable enough to any Prince, to receive the Congratulations, and hearty Ex|pre&s;&s;ions of their Subjects Joy upon Occa&s;ions of Succe&s;s, the Prote&s;tations of their Fidelity, and Zeal in National Exigencies, and the like: But to have Subjects Teizing their Sovereign with their wild Notions of Government, with their extravagant Sy&s;tems of Obedience, compliment|ing their Prince in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t and cour&s;e&s;t Manner, off'ring Service which their Prince knows they will never pay.&mdash;Cloathing their Sovereigns with Power they do not pretend to, or de&s;ire to exerci&s;e, and promi&s;ing a Submi&s;&s;ion to Burthens, they them&s;elves cou'd never bear.</P>
<P>This can never be plea&s;ant to a Prince, that knows any Thing of the Nature of Government, and the Temper of Subjects, e&s;pecially of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Government and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Subjects.</P>
<P><PB N="81" REF="82">
The Author no where de&s;igns in this, to le&s;&s;en the Credit of the Te&s;timonials any Part of the Country gives Her Maje&s;ty of their own Sin|cerity and Fidelity; or to in&s;inuate, that they, the Addre&s;&s;ors, are not Loyal, Good Subjects; but when People talk in the Clouds, blu&s;ter, and rumble, &s;peak a Language no Body can under&s;tand; and that they do not under&s;tand them&s;elves, it merits to be a little expos'd; if it be only to in&s;truct the hone&s;t Country People, what Language they ought to &s;peak to their So|vereign, and that when they make &s;olemn Ad|dre&s;&s;es to the Queen, they ought not to talk Non&s;ence, and Ridiculous Stuff, &s;uch as <HI>Re&s;i&s;ting Irre&s;istible Power, &V;nlimited Limited Obedience,</HI> and the like; lea&s;t the Queen &s;hou'd be in Ear|ne&s;t with their Je&s;t, and take it ill to be talk'$ to in a Language unbecoming even a Stage-Play.</P>
<P>But this is not all. This Ridiculous Manner of Addre&s;&s;ing takes off all the Solemnity of the Thing, and by Con&s;equence defeats the End of it. The Author of this profe&s;&s;es, not to con|cern him&s;elf with the pretended De&s;ign of the&s;e People, <HI>if they had any;</HI> and therefore, has turn'd it all upon that Point:&mdash;But really, the Man|ner of the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, the very wording them, is &s;o incongruous, &s;o un-harmonious, and lays them open to &s;o much Banter and Ridicule, that it quite &s;poils all the re&s;t; if any Expre&s;|&s;ion of Duty is intended, it's quite bla&s;ted, and blown up by the Blu&s;ter and Rhodomontade it comes dre&s;t up in; if any Thing by Way of Re|cognition of the Sovereign's Rightful Authority is intended, it's carry'd &s;o far beyond all Claim any Prince on Earth ever made, that the Compliment is quite turn'd into a Banter.</P>
<P><PB N="82" REF="83">
Can this be agreeable to a Monarchy, E|&s;tabli&s;h'd, <HI>as Our Queen thanks God this Monarchy is,</HI> upon the Laws of the Land? Can Her Ma|je&s;ty, with any Patience, hear the&s;e People pro|mi&s;e to Obey, and Submit to Her, tho' She &s;hould turn Tyrant and Oppre&s;&s;or.&mdash;It cannot but offend Her Royal Ears, as Her Maje&s;ty never de&s;ires to Rule in that Manner, &s;o She cannot de&s;ire to be &s;o Obey'd. Her Maje&s;ty covets the chearful Obedience of Free Subjects, but not the Servile Submi&s;&s;ion of degenerate Slaves: Be&s;ides, Her Maje&s;ty knows they &s;peak again&s;t their Sence, again&s;t their Temper, and again&s;t their Practice; they &s;ay, and promi&s;e to do, what they never did and never will perform.</P>
<P>What Plea&s;ure then can the Prince take in &s;uch Addre&s;&s;es as the&s;e? To imagine the Queen would be pleas'd with them, would be, either to pre&s;ume Her Maje&s;ty did not know when She was flatter'd and banter'd, or loved to be &s;o; either of which would be very unmannerly.</P>
<P>Nor can I believe, the Manner of obtaining the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, and the Con&s;equences of them, contribute any Thing towards giving the Pub|lick Mini&s;ters of the Government any Satis|faction in them.</P>
<P>In the procuring them, we find terrible Ragings, Heats, Divi&s;ions and Animo&s;ities a|mong the People: One Side oppo&s;ing the other with all po&s;&s;ible Fury and Artifice; &s;ometimes two contrary Addre&s;&s;es from the &s;ame Place; To procure the&s;e all the Caballing, Bribing, Wheedling, Threat'ning, and in &s;hort, all the clande&s;tine, corrupt Practices in the World, to get Hands crouded into an Addre&s;s; when both Sides pretending to &s;peak the Sence of the Place, all the Effect is, to let the Queen know,
<PB N="83" REF="84">
the People of that Place are mo&s;t horribly di|vided, and no Body knows which Side was the &s;tronge&s;t; for Hands to an Addre&s;s &s;eldom, if ever, are any Trial of the Strength of the o|ther Parties.</P>
<P>Again, this can be of no Service to the Go|vernment, and therefore, I am per&s;waded, our Mini&s;ters of State whether new or old, neither now do, or ever did, de&s;ire this tumultuous Way of Proceeding. It rai&s;es and maintains Factions in every Town and County, keeps up the Heats, and propagates the Party-Divi&s;ions, that are already come to too great a Head among us.</P>
<P>I make no Que&s;tion, the pre&s;ent Mini&s;try covet to cool, and bring to Temper the Heats, which the Court-Changes have rai&s;ed among the People; I am &s;ure, if they &s;ee their own Intere&s;t, I mean the Queen's Intere&s;t, they mu&s;t de&s;ire it; it cannot be plea&s;ant to them, to have &s;uch an Occa&s;ion of con&s;tant Feud put in the Way of the People.</P>
<P>Here one Side calls Rebel, Traytor, Facti|ous, Antimonarchical, and Enemy to the Church; the&s;e again call the other Slaves, Betrayers of their Country, Rai&s;ers of Tumults, and Friends to the Pretender; and what's next to hard Words, but hard Blows; and who knows to what Exce&s;&s;es exa&s;perated Parties may drive one another.</P>
<P>Nothing, therefore, that tends to embroil, to divide, and to exa&s;perate the People One again&s;t Another, can be approved by the Go|vernment, or the Mini&s;try.</P>
<P>It may not be ami&s;s to ob&s;erve here, that the flocking about the Court with Addre&s;&s;es, &s;eems to have an End, very differing from
<PB N="84" REF="85">
what the Addre&s;&s;es them&s;elves propo&s;e: For, in their Addre&s;&s;es, they make Tenders of the lowe&s;t Submi&s;&s;ion to the Plea&s;ure, and perfect Re&s;ignation to the Authority of their Sovereign; and yet in the Language of their Addre&s;&s;es, pretend to lay great Stre&s;s upon the Opinion of the Subjects, and upon this, or that Addre&s;s, being the Sen&s;e of the County, or the Sence of the Town they come from.</P>
<P>Now, if the Subject's Duty be an <HI>&V;nlimited Obedience,</HI> as &s;ome of the&s;e extravagant People have pretended; the Matter of this, or that, being the Sence of the People, &s;eems to be &s;o entirely u&s;ele&s;s and in&s;ignificant, that it can|not be nam'd with the re&s;t; For what &s;igni|fies it, what the Subject's Sence is, if their Part con&s;i&s;ts only in an <HI>&V;nlimited Submi&s;&s;ion.</HI></P>
<P>The next Thing which makes it &s;eem, that the&s;e Addre&s;&s;ings cannot be grateful to the Government, is, that they are of &s;o many dif|fering and incon&s;i&s;tent Parts, even tho' pre|&s;ented on the &s;ame Side, and from the &s;ame Parties: One gives up all Her Maje&s;ty's Claim to the Crown to Her <HI>Hereditary Right,</HI> and calls all the <HI>Parliamentary Part</HI> a Con&s;piracy again&s;t Her Maje&s;ty's <HI>Title,</HI> and an In&s;olent Attempt to <HI>depo&s;e</HI> Her; another talks of <HI>Legal Provi&s;ions</HI> to exclude <HI>Papists:</HI> One talks of <HI>Indefeizible Title</HI> immediately from God, and others com|pliment Her with the Peoples Acknowledg|ment of Her Title by <HI>De&s;cent.</HI></P>
<P>In the Matter of Government and Sub|mi&s;&s;ion they contradict one another, and con|tradict them&s;elves; &s;ome talk of <HI>Ab&s;olute Obe|dience,</HI> even to Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion; and of the <HI>Illegality of Re&s;istance on any Pretence;</HI> of the <HI>Non&s;ence of Re&s;istance,</HI> of the <HI>Ridioulou&s;|ne&s;s</HI>
<PB N="85" REF="86">
of it, of its being a <HI>Damnable Sin;</HI> while others &s;ay, they <HI>have re&s;isted,</HI> and <HI>will re&s;ist again.</HI> Thus they torture their Sovereigns with their unintelligible Stuff, and make them|&s;elves, no Doubt, very ridiculous.</P>
<P>Can any one make us believe, that this is plea&s;ant to Her Maje&s;ty, that it is any Way &s;erviceable to the New Mini&s;try, or agreeable to the Friends of their Intere&s;ts&mdash;Were the good People unanimous in their Application, uni|form in what they addre&s;s about, and would they keep the Bounds of Duty, and Rea&s;on in the Manner, &s;omething might be; it would be, indeed valuable, and an Honour, as well as a Sa|tisfaction both to the Government and to the So|vereign; but it really &s;eems to expo&s;e, rather than to &s;erve Her Maje&s;ty and Her Admini&s;tration, to have the People come thus in Fragments, and divided Parcels, with Papers &s;tuff'd with &s;uch ridiculous Things that are not tolerable to hear.</P>
<P>I cannot, therefore, think of &s;uppo&s;ing Her Maje&s;ty is at all plea&s;ed at the&s;e Things; neither can I &s;ee they are at all calculated to render Her Service. Non&s;ence and Folly &s;erves no Body; Prince or People.</P>
<P>As to Her Maje&s;ty's Intere&s;t, whether real or &s;uppo&s;ed; whether in the New Mini&s;try, or the Old; whether in Parliament, or out of it; the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es &s;eem to do it no Service at all.&mdash;If the Method of obtaining them were ju&s;tifiable, the Language of them agreable to Sence, the Con&s;equence of them Peace, and the Managing of them free of Di&s;orders, Riots, and a Civil War among Neighbourhoods and Societies, &s;ome|thing might be &s;aid, at lea&s;t, to palliate and ex|cu&s;e them.</P>
<P><PB N="86" REF="87">
Wi&s;e Mini&s;ters of State never covet Riots and Tumults, Breaches and Di&s;orders among the People. Peace, United Submi&s;&s;ion to the Admini&s;tration, and a due Obedience to the Laws, are the be&s;t Off'rings the People can make to them.&mdash;All Kinds of Di&s;tractions among the People, are, in their Degree, Un|ea&s;ine&s;&s;es to every Government: And, there|fore, whoever they are, that would per&s;wade us, the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, which 'tis manife&s;t have fomented our Breaches, are grateful to the Mi|ni&s;try, or to the Queen, do to the utmo&s;t of their Power, expo&s;e, ridicule and je&s;t with their Governours, banter the great Officers of the Court, and if they dur&s;t, would do the &s;ame to the Queen.</P>
<P>It is true, Her Maje&s;ty has receiv'd all the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es very graciou&s;ly, the &s;everal Lords, and others, of Her Maje&s;ty's Council, and Con|fidence, have concern'd them&s;elves to introduce the Addre&s;&s;ors to Her Maje&s;ty, and the Clowns, upon all the&s;e Occa&s;ions, have had the Honour to ki&s;s Her Maje&s;ty's Hand. What can any one infer from hence?&mdash;the be&s;t Con&s;truc|tion I can put upon it amounts to no more <HI>than this,</HI> that however fooli&s;h the Subject is, the Prince is <HI>good to all;</HI> as the Sun &s;hines upon the Garden, and upon the Dung-Hill; or as the Rain and &s;weet Dews di&s;till at the &s;ame <HI>Time,</HI> upon the barren Rocks, the &s;alt Ocean, and the fruitful, flow'ry Meadows, where in the one they are entirely lo&s;t, in the other turn'd to Salt and Barrene&s;s, and in the la&s;t to a fruitful Solacing and Profiting Flavour.</P>
<P>Her Maje&s;ty, like a gentle Prince, mild to all, &s;hows an undi&s;tingui&s;h'd and nouri&s;hing Goodne&s;s to Her Subjects; bears with their
<PB N="87" REF="88">
Follies and Infirmities, pities their Impertinen|ces, and nothing can be inferr'd from hence, but that here Her Maje&s;ty an&s;wers <HI>not a Fool in his Folly;</HI> and there again, She <HI>an&s;wers a Fool in his Folly;</HI> both Sides addre&s;s, both are accepted, both ki&s;s Her Maje&s;ty's Hand; what is good, and well mean't in all, Her Maje&s;ty accepts; what is &s;imple, ridiculous and impertinent in either, Her Maje&s;ty overlooks: And as She cannot know by the Addre&s;&s;es of the People, what to depend upon, or expect from them; &s;o neither can they know, or judge by their Reception, what Her Maje&s;ty's real Sentiments of the&s;e Things are, nor indeed, is it nece&s;|&s;ary they &s;hould.</P>
<P><HI>I mu&s;t ask Pardon</HI> of all that are otherwi&s;e minded, <HI>for Leave to think</HI> from hence, that really the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es have no Tendency to any Good, that they are no Manner of Advantage, either to one Side or other, and this is as near Saying they have no Signification, as any Man can de|&s;ire I &s;hou'd &s;peak. What then can remain, but to exhort the People of <HI>Britain,</HI> to leave off this &s;imple, nothing-meaning Way of Pro|ceeding; and to exhort tho&s;e that look on, to take no Notice of them, lay no Stre&s;s upon them one Way or other.&mdash;Upon all Occa|&s;ions &s;hew the Neglect that is due to them, and if no other Way can &s;uppre&s;s the Practice, let them &s;ee, that to addre&s;s&punc; or not addre&s;s, is &s;o near the &s;ame Thing, that to mind them is to no Manner of Purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>This would either</HI> put an End to the Thing, or cure it of the Di&s;temper; it would either bring the People to leave off Addre&s;&s;ing as a Thing of no Signification, and tending to no Advan|tage one Way or another; a vain, empty, fruit|le&s;s
<PB N="88" REF="89">
Folly, that neither had any Effect to them that made the Addre&s;s, or any Effect upon tho&s;e they made them to.</P>
<P><HI>Or el&s;e,</HI> It wou'd re&s;tore Addre&s;&s;ing to its u&s;ual Vertue and Signification, that the People addre&s;&s;ing, might know how with due Solem|nity, and in proper Terms to come before their Princes, not make Sport with their Superi|ours, and Banter in&s;tead of Addre&s;s them; That the Gravity and Maje&s;ty of the Thing may be pre&s;erv'd, and con&s;equently it may meet with a due Re&s;pect and Regard; that they may depend upon what is &s;poken, as &s;incere, and well meant; and without Danger to them&s;elves, might, believe their Subjects when they &s;peak to them.</P>
<P>This wou'd bring Addre&s;&s;ing to be, perhaps, in its kind u&s;eful again, and make it very ac|ceptable to the Government; then Princes might make &s;ome Judgment from it, of the Meaning of the People, of the Sence of the &s;everal Parts from whence they came, and might know how to take Mea&s;ures from them accordingly, which now, it would be the greate&s;t Folly in the World to attempt.</P>
<P>I had thought, to have let you &s;ee &s;ome|thing of the Opinion our Enemies have of the&s;e Things, and how ridiculous they make us look abroad; How the <HI>French</HI> look upon us as effectually fighting in this Paper-Combat, as if we were all in a Declar'd Open Civil War. It were worth Notice, to &s;peak a little to what they promi&s;e them&s;elves from our Follies of this kind; how they are prompted by the&s;e Things to carry on the War, and to run them&s;elves to all Manner of Extremities in the Holding out, bouying them&s;elves up with the Expectation;
<PB N="89" REF="90">
that the&s;e Follies mu&s;t end in more Fatal Di|&s;tractions, and mu&s;t produce &s;omething in their Favour.</P>
<P>Nor is this an unprofitable Reflection, if we were but in a Po&s;ture of Improving it as we might do:&mdash;What our Enemies rejoice at, we may very well think worth our While to enquire into; if our Divi&s;ions are their Hope, our Folly their Advantage, our Weakning their Strength, we may reflect, with a great Deal of Ju&s;tice, upon what we are doing, lea&s;t we give our Enemies a Light to &s;ee into our In|&s;ide, where we cannot look our &s;elves.</P>
<P>What can the <HI>French</HI> do, but laugh at our Madne&s;s, and flatter them&s;elves with making their Advantage of it? when they hear that the Subjects of <HI>England</HI> are playing <HI>Bo-Peep</HI> with their Sovereign:&mdash;When they &s;hall read the incongruous Non&s;ence of our Fawning Addre&s;|&s;ors, how they plea&s;e them&s;elves with the Jingle of <HI>&V;n-&s;ignifying Words,</HI> and go away plea&s;ed with a &s;uperficial <HI>THANK-YE,</HI> as if the Sim|plicity of their Harrangue was receiv'd with Approbation, and they counted, what none in the Earth, but them&s;elves, could ever &s;ugge&s;t of them, <HI>WISE MEN.</HI></P>
<P>Do we &s;ee any of the&s;e Extravagancies a|mong Foreign Nations? The <HI>French</HI> are as &s;upple, as humble in their Obedience, and have given as good Evidences of their &s;lavi&s;h Sub|mi&s;&s;ion, as any People in the World could do, or, indeed, as any People in the World could do, or, indeed, as any Prince in the World can de|&s;ire Subjects to do.&mdash;Their Monarchs are Ab|&s;olute, and might expect from them Expre&s;&s;ions of <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Loyalty,</HI> as ridiculous as that <HI>Pa&s;&s;ive Loyalty</HI> it &s;elf can be; and, indeed, in <HI>France,</HI> $span$ Language might have &s;ome Meaning in&punc;
<PB N="90" REF="91">
it: For where People are Slaves and Princes are Tyrants, &s;uch a Stile will bear a Reading, when in Nations born to Freedom it is meer Non&s;ence.</P>
<P>Yet even in <HI>France,</HI> or <HI>Spain,</HI> nay, not in <HI>Poland,</HI> or <HI>Ru&s;&s;ia,</HI> have you any Thing of the&s;e Follies to be &s;een; neither Prince or People think them of any Signification; the One does not accept them, the Other dare not offer them.</P>
<P><HI>No where,</HI> but in this Land of Liberty, is this Folly to be found; <HI>where,</HI> I think, the very Con&s;titution renders it ridiculous, and the Na|ture of the Thing makes it utterly contemp|tible.&mdash;Where the Laws expo&s;e it as Criminal, and the Peoples Rights make it ab&s;urd. To talk here of <HI>&V;nlimited Obedience,</HI> is to talk what no Body regards that hears it, and no Body believes that &s;peaks it.</P>
<P>This is the Rea&s;on why the&s;e Sheets were written, the Author is far from Le&s;&s;ening the Duty, and Affection of the People to their Sovereign; but, for God's-&s;ake, Gentlemen, if you will apply your &s;elves to your Queen, do it in Terms Her Maje&s;ty may believe you &s;erious in, and not in &s;uch, as mu&s;t tell the Queen, that either you &s;ay nothing, and are a Sort of Mad-Men not to be regarded; or that you de&s;ign to affront Her.&mdash;Pro|mi&s;e nothing, but what you can perform, and what there may be Room to expect you will perform: Then there will be no Room for Expo&s;ing you, and your Addre&s;&s;es may have &s;ome Signification.</P>
<P><PB N="91" REF="92">
To procure this happy Effect, either to bring our People to be out of Love with this Way of Fermenting their Tempers, and &s;o to lay down the Thing altogether&punc; or to bring them to mend their Stile, and word their Addre&s;&s;es &s;o, as Her Maje&s;ty may not be led to pity them, and the re&s;t of the People to laugh at them, this is the true De&s;ign of the pre&s;ent Undertaking, in which, the Au|thor hopes, he cannot have given Offence, &s;ince he has not meddled with the Parties, only made a little merry with their Non&s;ence.</P>
