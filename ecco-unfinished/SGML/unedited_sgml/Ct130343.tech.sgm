<HEAD>THE
PREFACE.</HEAD>
<P>_WHAT ever argument is in|&s;i&s;ted
on in behalf of Chri|&s;tianity,
whether the purity
of its doctrine, the fulfil|ment
of ancient prophecies,
the predictions and miracles
of our Saviour and his Apo&s;tles, or the pecu|liar
circum&s;tances of its propagation, it is
nece&s;&s;ary that we be apprized of the truth of
the things related in the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P>THE evidence of the truth of any hi&s;to|ry
is either internal or external. The inter|nal
evidence depends on the probability of
the things related, the con&s;i&s;tence of the &s;e|veral
parts, and the plainne&s;&s;e and &s;implicity
of the narration. The external evidence con|&s;i&s;ts
of the concurrence of other ancient wri|ters
<PB N="iv" REF="4">
of good credit, who lived at or near the
time in which any things are &s;aid to have
happened; and who bear te&s;timony to the
books them&s;elves, their Authors, or the facts
contained in them.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;erious and attentive reader is
able, in a great mea&s;ure, to judge of the in|ternal
marks of credibility of the hi&s;tory con|tained
in the <HI>New Te&s;tament:</HI> though he may
be very much a&s;&s;i&s;ted by the ob&s;ervations of
tho&s;e who are more curious or judicious than
him&s;elf. And for this purpo&s;e many excel|lent
writings have been publi&s;hed with very
great advantage in our own and other modern
languages.</P>
<P>THE external evidence of the truth of a|ny
ancient hi&s;tory, and particularly of the <HI>Go|&s;pel-Hi&s;tory,</HI>
lies not &s;o much within the
reach of the generality of mankind. And
though in &s;ome modern defen&s;es of the Chri|&s;tian
Religion there have been appeals and re|ferences
made to other ancient authors; yet
tho&s;e appeals have not been &s;o di&s;tinct, full,
and expre&s;s, as might have been wi&s;hed.
The writer has &s;uppo&s;ed his reader learned,
and not producing at length the te&s;timonies
he appeals to, the faith of the unlearned, as
<PB N="v" REF="5">
to this part of the evidence for Chri&s;tianity,
is &s;till re&s;olved very much into the credit and
authority of the Apologi&s;t.</P>
<P>THE peculiar de&s;ign of this work is to en|able
per&s;ons of ordinary capacities, who, for
want of a learned education, or of &s;ufficient
lei&s;ure, are deprived of the advantage of read|ing
over ancient writings, to judge for them|&s;elves
concerning the <HI>external</HI> evidence of the
facts related in the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P>AT pre&s;ent I offer only the evidence of the
facts <HI>Occa&s;ionally</HI> mentioned in the books of
the <HI>New Te&s;tament;</HI> intending hereafter to
treat of the <HI>Principal</HI> facts in a like manner.</P>
<P>THE method taken in this work is to &s;et
down in the fir&s;t place the repre&s;entation
which the &s;acred Writers have given of Per|&s;ons,
Facts, Cu&s;toms, or Principles, and then
to produce pa&s;&s;ages of other Ancient Writers,
which confirm or illu&s;trate the account deli|vered
in the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P>WHEREVER the matter treated of is of
any &s;pecial importance, or wherever there is
any ambiguity, or any peculiar beauty or em|pha&s;is
in the &s;tile and expre&s;&s;ion of the Au|thors
I quote, I have placed their original
words at the bottom of the Page.</P>
<P><PB N="vi" REF="6">
THERE are added likewi&s;e, here and there,
&s;ome &s;hort notes for the benefit of the un|learned
reader. The&s;e are referred to by &s;mall
Capitals; and I hope will be di&s;tingui&s;hed
from the original quotations, which are mark|ed
with &s;mall letters.</P>
<P>I PRESUME it is needle&s;s for me to ac|knowledge
particularly, that I am accountable
for the tran&s;lations of all the Pa&s;&s;ages here tran|&s;cribed:
or to declare, that I have u&s;ed the
be&s;t care I could about them. I may have
mi&s;taken, but I am &s;ure, that I have not,
with a view to any particular purpo&s;e what|ever,
de&s;ignedly mi&s;repre&s;ented any fact, or
given a wrong turn to any pa&s;&s;age. My put|ting
down the original words of my authors,
or very particular references to them, will
prevent all &s;u&s;picions of this kind.</P>
<P>THE reader is not to &s;uppo&s;e, that I have
exhau&s;ted the argument. The geography of
the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> and many facts, cu&s;toms
and principles; be&s;ide tho&s;e here in&s;i&s;ted on by
me, are al&s;o confirmed by te&s;timonies of an|cient
Writers. I apprehend however, that
what is here offered is &s;ufficient to an&s;wer the
end propo&s;ed. And tho' the po&s;itive part be
not full and compleat, and indeed could not
<PB N="vii" REF="7">
be &s;o without being tedious; yet I think I have
in the &s;econd book, taken in all the chief dif|ficulties
affecting that kind of facts I am now
concerned with.</P>
<P>THE point I was to make out is the credi|bility
of the <HI>Go&s;pel-Hi&s;tory.</HI> And to that I
have confined my&s;elf. But no one may hence
&s;urmi&s;e, that I give up the in&s;piration of the
books of the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI> Nor am I
aware, that I have in the le&s;t weakened any
argument, that they were written under a
&s;pecial direction and influence of the Spirit of
God. I think however, that if the Go&s;pel-Hi&s;tory
be credible, the truth of the Chri&s;tian
Religion cannot be conte&s;ted.</P>
<P>I FLATTER my&s;elf, my de&s;ign will be ap|proved.
I wi&s;h the execution had been equal
to the Subject. Imperfect as it is, I hope what
is here performed may be of u&s;e to remove,
or abate the prejudices of &s;ome, to confirm
others upon a good foundation in the belief of
the Chri&s;tian Religion, and in their high
e&s;teem for the Writers of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI>
and to enable them to read them with new
plea&s;ure and profit.</P>

<PB N="viii" REF="8">
<HEAD>Having in the following work made great
u&s;e of Philo and Jo&s;ephus, I here pre|fix
a &s;hort account of tho&s;e two writers.</HEAD>
<P>PHILO was a <HI>Jew</HI> of <HI>Alexandria</HI> in <HI>E|gypt,</HI>
brother<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. Antiq. 18. c. 9. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> of <HI>Alexander</HI> the <HI>Ala|barch</HI>
or chief magi&s;trate of the <HI>Jews</HI> in that
country. They having been much abu&s;ed by
the <HI>Egyptians</HI> and by <HI>Flaccus</HI> the Roman Pre&s;i|dent;
in the year of our Lord 39 or 40, <HI>Philo</HI>
with others was &s;ent to <HI>Caligula</HI> the Emperour
in the name of the whole <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people living
in <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The amba&s;&s;y con&s;i&s;ted of<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Philo. de legat. p. 1043. C.</NOTE>
five, and he<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1018. C.</NOTE> has a&s;&s;ured us him&s;elf, that he
was the elde&s;t and mo&s;t experienced per&s;on
among them. It is rea&s;onable to conclude there|fore,
that he was born at, or before the com|mencement
of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Aera.</HI> He was
eminent for his wit and learning, as well as for
his family. Many of his writings are &s;till re|maining,
tho' &s;ome have been lo&s;t. The two
<PB N="ix" REF="9">
books which I have chiefly quoted are his di&s;|cour&s;e
again&s;t the forementioned <HI>Flaccus,</HI> Pre|&s;ident
of <HI>Egypt,</HI> and his account of the <HI>Amba&s;|&s;y
to</HI> Caligula.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS,</HI> the Son of <HI>Matthias,</HI> of
the race of the Prie&s;ts, by his mother de&s;cend|ed
from the <HI>A&s;monean</HI> family, which for a
con&s;iderable time had the &s;upreme government
of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation, was born at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>
in the fir&s;t year of the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">In vit. &sect;. $.</NOTE> reign of <HI>Caligula,</HI>
A. D. 37. In the beginning of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> war
he commanded in <HI>Galilee. Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> then
General under <HI>Nero,</HI> having conquered that
country, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> became his pri&s;oner, and
continued with him as long as <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> &s;taid
in tho&s;e parts. When <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> being declar|ed
Emperour, went to <HI>Rome</HI> to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of the Empire, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;taid with <HI>Titus,</HI> was
pre&s;ent at the Siege of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and &s;aw the
ruine of his City and Country. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> af|terwards
&s;ettled at <HI>Rome,</HI> and obtained the
freedom of the City from <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian.</HI> Some
time after the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> he
wrote his hi&s;tory of the <HI>Jewi&s;h War</HI> in &s;even
<PB N="x" REF="10">
books. After that he wrote in twenty books
the <HI>Jewi&s;h Antiquities,</HI> or, Hi&s;tory of the
<HI>Jews</HI> from the creation of the world to the
twelfth of <HI>Nero,</HI> in which year the War be|gan.
This work he fini&s;hed in the 56th year
of his own age, in the 13th year of the reign
of <HI>Domitian,</HI> A. D. 93. Be&s;ide the&s;e, we have
his <HI>Life,</HI> writ by him&s;elf, and two books
again&s;t <HI>Apion</HI> an <HI>Egyptian</HI> Author, who had
calumniated the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vid. Antiq. 20. c. 10. Vit. &sect;. 75, 76. De Bell. in Proem.</NOTE> people. The

<P>_I NOW allow, that the words of St.

in which they are under&s;tood by <HI>Her|waert</HI>

di&s;pute mo&s;t of the examples alledged

is but a &s;mall alteration made in that article. The

con&s;ider afre&s;h what I had &s;aid concerning <HI>Ma|crobius</HI>'s
pa&s;&s;age. I hope, what is now added will

the <HI>Egyptian</HI> Impo&s;tor, which I received
from Mr. <HI>Ward.</HI> The&s;e and the few other alterations

may be had &s;eparate, I hope the fir&s;t edition is not

<HEAD>THE
INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Hi&s;tory of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> hath,
in an eminent degree, all the internal
marks and characters of credibility. The
writers appear hone&s;t and impartial. They
&s;eem to have &s;et down very fairly the ex|ceptions
and reflexions of enemies, and to have re|corded
without re&s;erve the weakne&s;&s;es, mi&s;takes, or
even greater faults, which they them&s;elves, or any of
their own number, engaged in the &s;ame de&s;ign with
them, were guilty of. There is between the four
<HI>Evangeli&s;ts</HI> an harmony, hitherto unparallel'd be|tween
&s;o many per&s;ons, who have all writ of the
&s;ame times or events. The le&s;&s;er differences, or
&s;eeming contradictions, which are to be found in
them, only demon&s;trate they did not write with con|cert.
The other parts of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> concur
with them in the &s;ame Facts, and Principles. The&s;e
are things obvious to all, who read the books of the
<HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> with attention. And the more they
are read, the more con&s;picuous will the tokens of
credibility appear.</P>
<P>BUT it mu&s;t be an additional &s;atisfaction, to find
that the&s;e writers are &s;upported in their narration, by
other approved authors of different characters, who
lived at or near the time in which the facts, related by
the <HI>Evangeli&s;ts,</HI> are &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened.</P>
<P>IT is plainly the de&s;ign of the Hi&s;torians of the
<HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> to write of the actions of Je&s;us Chri&s;t,
chiefly tho&s;e of his publick mini&s;try; and to give an
<PB N="2" REF="18">
account of his death and re&s;urrection, and of &s;ome of the
fir&s;t &s;teps, by which the Doctrine, he had taught, made
its way in the world. But though this was their main
de&s;ign, and they have not undertaken to give us the
political &s;tate or hi&s;tory of the countries in which
the&s;e things were done; yet in the cour&s;e of their
narration they have been lead unavoidably to mention
many per&s;ons of note; and to make allu&s;ions and refe|rences
to the cu&s;toms and tenets of the people, whom
Je&s;us Chri&s;t and his Apo&s;tles were concerned with.</P>
<P>HERE are therefore two kinds of Facts, Principal,
and Occa&s;ional. The Principal Facts are the birth,
and preaching of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t;</HI> the miraculous
conception and birth, the di&s;cour&s;es, miracles, pre|dictions,
crucifixion, re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion of
Je&s;us Chri&s;t; the mi&s;&s;ion of the Apo&s;tles, the de|&s;cent
of the Holy Gho&s;t upon them, and the other
atte&s;tations which were given to the divine authority
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t, and the truth of his doctrine. The
things occa&s;ionally mentioned are the e&s;tate and cha|racter
of the Princes and Governours, in who&s;e time
the&s;e events are placed; the &s;tate of the <HI>Jews,</HI> their
opinions, and practi&s;es, as al&s;o tho&s;e of other people
to whom the Apo&s;tles came.</P>
<P>THE Facts related in the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> are all
(except &s;ome few mentioned in the Book of the <HI>Reve|lations)</HI>
&s;uppo&s;ed to have come to pa&s;s before the de|&s;truction
of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which happened in the &s;even|tieth
year of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Aera.</HI> And the&s;e hi&s;to|rians
do throughout maintain the character of per&s;ons
perfectly well acquainted with the matters of which
they write.</P>
<P>Two of the&s;e books, the Go&s;pels of <HI>Matthew</HI> and
<HI>John,</HI> bear the names of per&s;ons who are &s;aid to have
been pre&s;ent at a good part of tho&s;e tran&s;actions,
they give an account of. <HI>Mark</HI> writes as one fully
ma&s;ter of his &s;ubject, and <HI>Luke</HI> (Chap. i. 3.) affirms
expre&s;ly, that he <HI>had perfect under&s;tanding of all things
from the very fir&s;t,</HI> and that he was able to write in
<PB N="3" REF="19">
order of tho&s;e things he undertook to relate. In the&s;e
four pieces we have the hi&s;tory of between thirty and
forty years, from the vi&s;ion of <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the Tem|ple
at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to the A&s;cen&s;ion of Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</P>
<P>BESIDE the&s;e, we have al&s;o a book called the Acts
of the Apo&s;tles, a&s;cribed to the la&s;t mentioned writer;
in which is contain'd the hi&s;tory of many wonderful
events, which followed the re&s;urrection, and a&s;cen&s;ion
of Je&s;us Chri&s;t. If he had perfect under&s;tanding of
all things from the very beginning of the Go&s;pel of
Chri&s;t, he may be well &s;uppo&s;ed throughly acquaint|ed
with the&s;e later events, as nearer his own time.
And indeed in a great part of this work he &s;u&s;tains
the character of an Eye-witne&s;s.</P>
<P>OMITTING, for the pre&s;ent, the particular con|&s;ideration
of the Principal Facts of this hi&s;tory, and
the direct and po&s;itive atte&s;tations given to the truth
of them (as well as to the genuine&s;&s;e of the&s;e writings)
by a great number of per&s;ons, who lived near the time
in which they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have happened; and who
after a &s;erious and diligent enquiry were convinced of
the truth of them, and upon the ground of that per&s;wa|&s;ion
renounced the principles of their education, and
ever after con&s;tantly maintained and profe&s;s'd the truth
of the facts and principles contain'd in the&s;e books,
with great hazard of their ea&s;e, reputation, e&s;tates and
lives; I &s;hall now take a view of tho&s;e Facts only,
which are occa&s;ionally mentioned in the <HI>New Te&s;ta|ment;</HI>
and enquire into the external evidences of the
truth of them.</P>
<P>IF it appear from other writers, that our Sacred
Hi&s;torians have mi&s;taken the people and affairs of the
time, in which, according to their own account, the
things they relate, happened; it will be an argument
that they did not write till &s;ome con&s;iderable time af|terwards.
But if upon enquiry there be found an
agreement between them and other writers, of un|doubted
authority, not in &s;ome few, but in many, in
all the particulars of this kind which they have men|tioned;
<PB N="4" REF="20">
it will be a very &s;trong pre&s;umption that they
wrote at, or very near the time, in which the things
they relate are &s;aid to have happened.</P>
<P>THIS will give credit to the other, the main parts
of their narration. An hi&s;tory writ and publi&s;hed near
the time of any events is credible, unle&s;s there appear
&s;ome particular views of intere&s;t; of which there is no
evidence in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, but quite the contrary.</P>
<P>THE hi&s;tory now before us is the hi&s;tory of many
great and wonderful works, done in &s;ome of the be&s;t
peopled and mo&s;t frequented parts of the earth. They
are related with very particular circum&s;tances of time
and place, and &s;ome of them are &s;aid to have been done
in the pre&s;ence of great numbers of people. Here is
withal an account of proceedings and &s;entences of
Courts of Judicature, in cities of the fir&s;t rank, at
times of the greate&s;t and mo&s;t general re&s;ort; and of
&s;ome di&s;cour&s;es made before per&s;ons (next under the
<HI>Roman Emperour)</HI> of the highe&s;t rank and distinction.
One manife&s;t de&s;ign of the whole is to overthrow the
religious tenets, then generally received in the world.
It is writ in the language, not of &s;ome ob&s;cure kingdom,
but of a learned and numerous people, under&s;tood at
that time by all the polite, and by many others in
every part of the known world. For any men to pub|li&s;h
&s;uch an hi&s;tory of &s;uch things as lately done, if
not punctually true, could have been only to expo&s;e
them&s;elves to an ea&s;y confutation, and certain infamy.</P>
<P>I propo&s;e therefore to give a long enumeration of
particulars, occa&s;ionally mentioned by the Writers of
the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> in which they are &s;upported by
Authors of the be&s;t note; and then in an&s;wer to divers
objections, I &s;hall endeavour to &s;hew, that they are not
contradicted in the re&s;t.</P>
<P>IF I &s;ucceed in this attempt, here will be a good ar|gument
for the genuine&s;&s;e of the&s;e Writings, and for the
truth of the Principal Facts contained in them; di&s;tinct
from the expre&s;s and po&s;itive te&s;timonies of Chri&s;tian
writers, and the conce&s;&s;ions of many others.</P>

<HI>Tetrarch of</HI> Iturea, <HI>and the region of</HI> Trachonitis.
That is, they were then in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame
territories and titles, which were a&s;&s;igned them by
their father's la&s;t will, and <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s decree. And it
was this &s;ame <HI>Herod</HI> Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee,</HI> to whom
our Saviour was &s;ent by <HI>Pilate,</HI> when he was accu&s;ed
before him, <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 6, 7.</P>
<P>THAT PHILIP was Tetrarch of <HI>Trachonitis,</HI> in
the fifteenth year of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> we are a&s;&s;ured by <HI>Jo|&s;ephus,</HI>

<HI>John,</HI> and bound him in pri&s;on, for <HI>Herodias</HI> &s;ake, his
brother <HI>Philip</HI>'s wife; for he had married her. For
<HI>John</HI> &s;aid unto <HI>Herod,</HI> it is not lawful for thee to have
thy brother's wife: Therefore <HI>Herodias</HI> had a quarrel
again&s;t him, and would have killed him, but &s;he could
not. For <HI>Herod</HI> feared <HI>John,</HI> knowing that he was a
ju&s;t man and an holy, and ob&s;erved him&mdash;And when
a convenient day was come, that <HI>Herod</HI> on his birth-day
<PB N="13" REF="29">
made a &s;upper to his lords, high captains, and chief
e&s;tates of <HI>Galilee:</HI> And when the daughter of the &s;aid
<HI>Herodias</HI> came in and danced and plea&s;ed <HI>Herod,</HI> and
them that &s;at with him, the king &s;aid unto the dam&s;el,

<P>THIS unlawful marriage is recorded in <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI>
&startq;About this time there happened a difference be|tween
<HI>Aretas</HI> King of <HI>Petraea,</HI> and <HI>Herod,</HI> upon
this occa&s;ion. <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Tetrarch</HI> had married the
daughter of <HI>Aretas,</HI> and lived a con&s;iderable time
with her. But in a journey he took to <HI>Rome,</HI> he
made a vi&s;it to <HI>Herod,</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> here calls <HI>Herodias</HI>'s fir&s;t husband <HI>Herod.</HI> The Evangeli&s;ts call him <HI>Philip.</HI> This difficulty will be con&s;idered among&s;t the objections.</NOTE> his brother (though not
by the &s;ame mother, for <HI>Herod</HI> was born of <HI>Simon</HI>'s

with <HI>Herodias,</HI> the wife of the &s;aid <HI>Herod,</HI> daughter
of their brother <HI>Ari&s;tobulus,</HI> and &s;i&s;ter of <HI>Agrippa</HI>
the Great, he ventured to make her propo&s;als of
Marriage. She not di&s;liking them, they agreed
together at this time, that when he was returned
from <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;he &s;hould go and live with him. And
it was one part of their contract, that <HI>Aretas</HI>'s
daughter &s;hould be put away<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 18. c. 6. &sect;. 1.</NOTE>&endq;.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> &s;peaks again of this Marriage in
another place, from which it appears likewi&s;e that
<PB N="14" REF="30">
<HI>Herodias</HI> had a daughter by her fir&s;t husband. She
is generally &s;uppo&s;ed to be the per&s;on who&s;e dan&s;ing
&s;o much entertained <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Tetrarch.</HI> Giving an
account of <HI>Herod</HI>'s children and grand-children he &s;ays:
&startq;<HI>Herodias</HI> was married to <HI>Herod,</HI> &s;on of <HI>Herod the
Great,</HI> by <HI>Mariamne</HI> daughter of <HI>Simon</HI> the High-Prie&s;t.
They had a daughter who&s;e name was <HI>Sa|lome,</HI>
after who&s;e birth, <HI>Herodias,</HI> in utter viola|tion
of the laws of her country, left her husband

<P>IT may, perhaps, be expected, I &s;hould here pro|duce
an in&s;tance about that time, of &s;ome Lady of a
like &s;tation with <HI>Herodias</HI>'s daughter, who dan&s;ed at
a public entertainment. But I mu&s;t own, I am not
furni&s;hed with any in&s;tance exactly parallel. And I
&s;hould conclude from this very Story, as related by
the Evangeli&s;ts, that this dan&s;e was a very unu&s;ual, if
not a &s;ingular piece of complai&s;ance. If it had been
a common thing, its not to be &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>Herod</HI>
would have thought of requiting it with &s;o large a
pre&s;ent as half his kingdom.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the <HI>daughter of the &s;aid Herodias,</HI> ha|ving
received from <HI>Herod</HI> a &s;olemn promi&s;e, confirm|ed
by an oath, that he would give her <HI>what&s;oever &s;he
&s;hould ask of him,</HI> and &s;he having withdrawn and ad|vi&s;ed
with her mother, <HI>came with ha&s;t unto the king,
and asked, &s;aying, I will that thou give me by and by
in a charger the head of</HI> John <HI>the</HI> Bapti&s;t.&mdash;And <HI>im|mediately
the king &s;ent an executioner, and commanded his
head to be brought; And he went and beheaded him in
the pri&s;on. And brought his head in a charger, and
gave it to the dam&s;el, and the dam&s;el gave it to her
mother,</HI> Mark vi. 25, 27, 28.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="31">
AT the time of this event it was common for
Princes to require the heads of eminent per&s;ons,

<P>WE have an in&s;tance in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> which follows the
&s;tory of this Marriage. <HI>Aretas</HI> was extremely provo|ked
at the treatment of his daughter, and at length

was fought, and <HI>Herod</HI>'s troups were defeated. &startq;<HI>He|rod</HI>

on occa&s;ion of the advancement of her own bro|ther,

<P>The Hi&s;torian proceeds to relate, that &s;he per&s;waded
her husband to go into <HI>Italy,</HI> that he might obtain
the &s;ame title. He was aver&s;e at fir&s;t: However at
length &s;he prevailed upon him to undertake the Jour|ney.
But the Emperour was &s;o far from granting his
petition, that upon &s;ome informations he received con|cerning
him, he took away from him the Tetrarchie of
<HI>Galilee,</HI> and gave it to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> the brother of <HI>Hero|dias,</HI>
who had been the object of her envie; and more|over
bani&s;hed <HI>Herod</HI> to <HI>Lyons</HI> in <HI>Gaul,</HI> whither this wife

<P>&sect;. VI. We may now proceed to another of <HI>Herod</HI>'s
family, of whom St. <HI>Luke</HI> has given us a very remar|kable
hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>NOW about that time, <HI>HEROD</HI> the king &s;tretched
forth his hands, to vex certain of the church. And he kil|led
<HI>James</HI> the brother of <HI>John</HI> with the &s;word. And be|cau&s;e
he &s;aw it plea&s;ed the <HI>Jews,</HI> he proceeded farther
to take <HI>Peter</HI> al&s;o. Then were the days of unleavened
bread, <HI>Acts</HI> xii. 1&mdash;3.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> calls this per&s;on <HI>Herod,</HI> by the family
name; <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> calls him <HI>Agrippa.</HI> He was Grand&s;on
of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great. His father was <HI>Ari&s;tobulus, He|rod</HI>'s
Son by <HI>Mariamne,</HI> Grandaughter of <HI>Hyrcanus:</HI>
And is the &s;ame per&s;on who has been already mentioned
as brother <HI>of Herodias.</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives him the title of
<HI>King,</HI> and relates &s;everal acts of &s;overeign authority
done by him. He does not &s;ay expre&s;ly that they were
done by him at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> But there are divers parti|culars
<PB N="18" REF="34">
in the relation, which plainly determine <HI>that</HI> to
be the &s;cene of action. For <HI>St. Luke</HI> ob&s;erves that when
he took <HI>Peter, then were the daies of unleavened bread,</HI>
that <HI>he intended, after</HI> EASTER <HI>to bring him forth to the</HI>
PEOPLE. And that when <HI>Peter</HI> was out of pri&s;on, <HI>and
was come to him&s;elf, he &s;aid, Now know I of a &s;urety, that
the Lord&mdash;has delivered me out of the hand of</HI> Herod,
<HI>and from all the expectation of the</HI> PEOPLE OF THE JEWS,
<HI>ver.</HI> 11. And when he had <HI>commanded the keepers to be
put to death,</HI> he went down from JUDEA <HI>to</HI> Ce&s;area <HI>and
there abode,</HI> ver. 19. A pa&s;&s;age or two from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
will confirm the repre&s;entation St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives of <HI>He|rod</HI>'s
being <HI>King,</HI> and that of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>IT was by &s;everal &s;teps that he was advanced to this
dignity. His fir&s;t preferment was from <HI>Caligula,</HI> A. D.
37. &startq;And &s;ending for him to his palace he <HI>[Caligula]</HI>

THE JEWS, <HI>he proceeded farther, to take</HI> Peter <HI>al&s;o.</HI> That
it is very likely he &s;hould be moved by &s;uch a con&s;ide|ration
as this, is evident from the character which <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>
has given of him. <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, his Grand|father,
he &s;ays, was continually obliging foreign States
and Cities by large bounties; but did very few things
to gratify the <HI>Jews.</HI> Whereas, &startq;<HI>Agrippa</HI> was of a mild
and gentle di&s;po&s;ition, and good to all men; he was
beneficent to &s;trangers, but e&s;pecially kind to the
<HI>Jews</HI> his countrymen, and &s;ympathi&s;ed with them
in all their troubles. For which rea&s;on al&s;o he lived
much at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> ob&s;erved the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> in&s;titutions,
practi&s;ed the purity they require, and did not let a
day pa&s;s without wor&s;hiping God according to the
Lawe<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. lib. 19. cap. 7. &sect;. 3.</NOTE>&endq;. This his zeal for the in&s;titutions and
cu&s;toms of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and his de&s;ire to oblige that peo|ple
very much confirm the account St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives of his
forwardne&s;&s;e in per&s;ecuting the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>WHAT St. <HI>Luke</HI> adds concerning this per&s;on is a very

<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI>'s words are the&s;e: &startq;Having now

began in &s;everal parts of the theatre flattering ac|clamations,

mortal.</HI> The King neither reproved the&s;e per&s;ons,
nor rejected the impious flattery. Soon after this,
ca&s;ting his eyes upward he &s;aw an owle &s;iting upon
a certain cord over his head. He perceived it to
be a me&s;&s;enger of evil to him, as it had been be|fore
of his pro&s;perity; and was &s;truck with the
deepe&s;t concern. Immediately after this, he was
&s;eized with pains in his bowels extremely violent at
the very fir&s;t. Then turning him&s;elf toward his
friends, he &s;poke to them in this manner: <HI>I, your
God, am required to leave this world; Fate in&s;tant|ly
confuting the&s;e fal&s;e applau&s;es ju&s;t be&s;towed upon
me: I, who have been called immortal, am hurried
away to death. But God's appointment mu&s;t be &s;ub|mitted
<PB N="21" REF="37">
to. Nor has our condition in this world been
de&s;picable; we have lived in the &s;tate which is ac|counted
happy.</HI> While he was &s;peaking the&s;e words,
he was oppre&s;&s;ed with the increa&s;e of his pains. He
was carried therefore with all ha&s;t to his palace.
The&s;e pains in his bowels continually tormenting
him, he expired in five days time, in the fifty
fourth year of his age<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. lib. 19. c. 8. &sect;. 2.</NOTE>, and of his reign the
&s;eventh<NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note;</HI> The &s;eventh year of his reign is computed from the time of his fir&s;t advancement, by <HI>Caligula,</HI> to the Tetrarchie of his uncle <HI>Philip;</HI> A. D. 37.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>IT is needle&s;s to make many reflexions here. The
reader's thoughts cannot but carry him to many
<PB N="22" REF="38">
points of agreement in the&s;e two relations. They
agree, that this event happened at <HI>Ce&s;area: St. Luke</HI>
&s;ays, it was upon <HI>a &s;et day; Jo&s;ephus,</HI> that it was up|on
the <HI>&s;econd day of the &s;hows</HI> celebrated in honour of
the Emperour. The magnificence of <HI>Herod</HI>'s dre&s;&s;e is
hinted by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and particularly de&s;cribed by <HI>Jo|&s;epus.</HI>
The flattery is exactly the &s;ame in both. But
in two things, above all others, is the harmony of
the&s;e accounts ob&s;ervable. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the temper of mind
with which <HI>Herod</HI> received this flattery. St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays,
<HI>he gave not God the glory;</HI> Jo&s;ephus, <HI>he neither re|proved
the&s;e per&s;ons, nor rejected the impious flattery:</HI>
words that de&s;erve particular notice in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> be|cau&s;e he has at times repre&s;ented this <HI>Herod Agrip|pa</HI>
as an extraordinary per&s;on, and free from the
vices of his grandfather <HI>Herod;</HI> and indeed has en|deavoured
to rai&s;e his character for lenity and good|ne&s;&s;e beyond
what is con&s;i&s;tent with &s;ome other ac|counts.
For <HI>Dio Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Agrippa</HI> was reckoned
one of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s advi&s;ers in his cruel and tyrannical
mea&s;ures<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Dio. lib. 59. p. 658.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>ANOTHER thing, in which this harmony is very
con&s;iderable, is, that according to St. <HI>Luke,</HI> imme|diately
the angel of the Lord &s;mote him: And <HI>Jo&s;e|pus</HI>
a&s;&s;ures us, that the&s;e pains &s;eized him in the thea|tre,
before all the a&s;&s;embly, and that he apprehend|ed
a fatal nece&s;&s;ity of &s;peedily leaving this world.
And when <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, <HI>the&s;e flattering acclamations
proved pernicious to</HI> Agrippa, he plainly intimates that
his death was &s;uppo&s;ed to be a puni&s;hment for the
approbation with which he received them.</P>
<P>THOUGH St. <HI>Luke</HI> only had related this event,
and there had been no account of it extant in <HI>Jo&s;e|phus,</HI>
or any other ancient writer, yet I &s;hould not
<PB N="23" REF="39">
have doubted the truth of it. St. <HI>Luke</HI> would not
otherwi&s;e have dared to relate an affair &s;o di&s;advan|tageous,
as this is in many re&s;pects, to &s;o con&s;iderable
a per&s;on as <HI>Herod;</HI> who was very acceptable to the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people, and had received many honours and
civilities from two &s;ucce&s;&s;ive Roman Emperours, <HI>Ca|ligula</HI>
and <HI>Claudius.</HI> Nor would any Man of tolera|ble
capacity, much le&s;s &s;o &s;en&s;ible a per&s;on as St. <HI>Luke</HI>
appears to be by his writings, have expo&s;ed his credit
by placing &s;uch an event in &s;o public and noted a
place as <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI> the per&s;on concerned being &s;eated
on a throne, &s;urrounded by attendance &s;uitable to the
occa&s;ion of a particular &s;olemnity, if he had not
been &s;ure of the fact. And yet it may be &s;aid to
receive a farther confirmation from <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> who,
we may be a&s;&s;ured, out of regard to his own credit,
and his favourable inclination to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> would never
invent &s;uch a &s;tory as this.</P>
<P>AS for the owle which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;peaks of, and
which is now &s;aid to be a <HI>Me&s;&s;enger of evil</HI> to <HI>Agrip|pa,</HI>
as <HI>it had been before of his pro&s;perity;</HI> it has refe|rence
to an account he has given of the perching of
&s;uch a bird upon a tree near this &s;ame <HI>Agrippa,</HI> when
he was put into chains by order of <HI>Tiberius;</HI> and to
a progno&s;tication, which a <HI>German</HI> A&s;trologer is &s;aid
to have delivered at that time concerning him<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;. Antiq. l. 18. cap. vii. &sect;. 7.</NOTE>.
Whether &s;uch a bird did now appear in the theatre
or not, I will not determine; nor do I think it ma|terial.
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> does now and then throw a circum|&s;tance
or two into his relations that give them an
Heatheni&s;h aire; with a de&s;ign, it is probable, of
rendering his hi&s;tory more agreeable to the <HI>Greeks</HI>
and <HI>Romans,</HI> for whom it was principally intended.
But it is evident from his account, that <HI>Herod</HI> was
&s;eized with a very uncommon di&s;order, and that he
had the mo&s;t lively apprehen&s;ions of his approach|ing death.
<PB N="24" REF="40">
ST. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Herod was eaten of worms.</HI> This is
not mentioned by <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> And this has been &s;up|po&s;ed
by &s;ome to be a con&s;iderable objection again&s;t
St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account. But in my opinion without any
good rea&s;on. For the di&s;temper, of which <HI>Herod
Agrippa</HI> died, was, according to <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s own de|&s;cription
of it, very like to that of <HI>Herod</HI> his Grand|father;
who, be&s;ide other di&s;orders, was aflicted
with violent pains in his bowels, and an ulcer which
bred worms<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ant. lib. xvii. cap. vi. &sect;. 5.</NOTE>. And it is not at all unlikely that
<HI>Agrippa</HI>'s ca&s;e was, in this la&s;t re&s;pect al&s;o, very
much the &s;ame with that of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great. I &s;hould
think, that mo&s;t per&s;ons mu&s;t be a&s;hamed to repre|&s;ent
the omi&s;&s;ion of this particular in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> as an
objection of any moment. The di&s;tempers of great
men are &s;eldom particularly de&s;cribed. A certain
delicacie often re&s;trains men from making mention of
&s;uch matters, and e&s;pecially are hi&s;torians &s;hy of re|lating
them concerning tho&s;e princes, in who&s;e ho|nour
they are intere&s;ted. Upon the whole, I believe,
this pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> will be allowed to be a very
remarkable atte&s;tation of this extraordinary event,
related by St. <HI>Luke.</HI></P>
<P>IT will be of u&s;e to put down here from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
the names of <HI>Herod Agrippa</HI>'s children. &startq;Thus died
King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> leaving behind him one Son named
<HI>Agrippa,</HI> then &s;eventeen years of age, and three
daughters, <HI>Bernice,</HI> who was married to <HI>Herod</HI> her
father's brother, being Sixteen years of age, <HI>Ma|riamne,</HI>

former was ten years old, and <HI>Dru&s;illa</HI> Six&mdash;<HI>Dru|&s;illa</HI>

<P>&sect;. VII. FROM the xxiii. and two following chap|ters
of the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> we learn that <HI>Felix</HI> was
Governour in <HI>Judea,</HI> and that <HI>Porcius Fe&s;tus</HI> &s;ucceed|ed

him; the truth of which is particularly atte&s;ted by
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. xx. cap. vi, vii. De B. J. lib. 2. c. 12. &sect;. 8. &amp;c. 13, 14.</NOTE>, in divers parts of his hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>&sect;. VIII. CONCERNING <HI>Felix,</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> has men|tioned
divers things be&s;ide his being Governour, that
will de&s;erve our con&s;ideration. Whil&s;t St. <HI>Paul</HI> was
at <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;aies: <HI>and after certain daies,
when</HI> Felix <HI>came with his wife</HI> DRUSILLA, <HI>which was
a Jewe&s;&s;e, he &s;ent for</HI> Paul, <HI>and heard him concerning
the faith in Chri&s;t,</HI> Acts xxiv. 24. This <HI>Dru&s;illa</HI> is
the younge&s;t daughter of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> as was &s;hewn
ju&s;t now. We have this account in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> of her
marriage with <HI>Felix.</HI></P>
<P>&startq;<HI>AGRIPPA</HI> having received this pre&s;ent from
<HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> [viz. <HI>Claudius</HI>] gave his Si&s;ter <HI>Dru&s;illa</HI> in
marriage<NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">This was done, A. D. 52, or 53.</NOTE> to <HI>Azizus</HI> King of the <HI>Eme&s;enes,</HI> when
he had con&s;ented to be circumci&s;ed<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. lib. 20. c. 6. &sect;. 1, 2.</NOTE>. For <HI>Epi|phanes</HI>
the Son of King <HI>Antiochus</HI> had broke the
contract with her by refu&s;ing to embrace the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
cu&s;toms, although he had promi&s;ed her father he
would.&mdash;But this marriage of <HI>Dru&s;illa</HI> with <HI>Azizus</HI>
was di&s;&s;olved, in a &s;hort time, after this manner.
When <HI>Felix</HI> was Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> having had
a &s;ight of her, he was mightily taken with her,
and indeed, &s;he was the mo&s;t beautiful of her Sex.
<PB N="26" REF="42">
He therefore &s;ent to her <HI>Simon,</HI> a <HI>Jew</HI> of <HI>Cyprus,</HI>
who was one of his friends, and pretended to Ma|gic;
by whom he per&s;waded her to leave her hu&s;|band
and marry him, promi&s;ing to make her per|fectly
happy, if &s;he did not di&s;dain him. It was
far from being a &s;ufficient rea&s;on, but to avoid the
envy of her Si&s;ter <HI>Bernice,</HI> who was continually do|ing
her ill offices becau&s;e of her beauty, &s;he was
induced to tran&s;gre&s;s the laws of her country, and
marry <HI>Felix.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>IT has been thought indeed by &s;ome, that <HI>Tacitus</HI>
gives a different account of this <HI>Dru&s;illa,</HI> when he
&s;aies that <HI>Felix</HI> had for his wife, <HI>Dru&s;illa,</HI> grandaugh|ter
of <HI>Cleopatra</HI> and <HI>Antony.</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">&mdash;Dru&s;illa Cleopatrae &amp; Antonii nepte in matrimonium accepta: ut eju&s;dem Antonii, Felix progener, Claudius nepos e&s;&s;et. Hi&s;t. lib. v. cap. 9.</NOTE>. But I don't know
that I am obliged to take notice of this; &s;ince <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>
agrees with St. <HI>Luke, [that &s;he was a</HI> Jewe&s;&s;e.]
And he may be ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to be as well ac|quainted
with <HI>Dru&s;illa</HI>'s original as <HI>Tacitus.</HI> I &s;hall
only ob&s;erve, that <HI>Suetonius</HI> &s;aies that <HI>Felix</HI> married
three Queens<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Felicem, quem&mdash;provinciaeque Judaeae praepo&s;uit, trium reginarum maritum, Suet. Claud, c. 28.</NOTE>, or three women of royal families.
It is certain that <HI>Dru&s;illa</HI> a <HI>Jewe&s;&s;e,</HI> Si&s;ter of <HI>Agrippa</HI>
the younger, was one of them. And if <HI>Tacitus</HI> was
not mi&s;taken, another of them was de&s;cended from
<HI>Cleopatra</HI> the Queen of <HI>Egypt</HI> and <HI>Antony,</HI> and was
called <HI>Dru&s;illa.</HI><NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">She is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome learned men to be the daughter of <HI>Juba,</HI> King of <HI>Mauritania,</HI> by <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> daughter of <HI>M.

the re&s;entment of <HI>Nero.</HI></P>
<P>ALL the&s;e abovementioned particulars from <HI>Jo&s;e|phus,</HI>
and <HI>Tacitus,</HI> may &s;atisfy us, that when <HI>Paul</HI>
[Acts xxiv. 25.] <HI>rea&s;oned of righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e, temperance</HI>

<P>SOME may think it &s;trange, that <HI>Felix</HI> &s;hould have
had any hopes of receiving <HI>money</HI> from this pri&s;oner,

a &s;ub&s;i&s;tence. But in an&s;wer to this, it has been ob|&s;erved

<HI>after many years</HI> he <HI>came to bring alms to his nation and

as yet, &s;ince <HI>Paul</HI> was apprehended within a few daies
after his coming to <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI> [Ch. xxi. 27, xxiv. 11.]

<P>_IN con&s;idering the &s;tate of the <HI>Jews</HI> in their
own country, two things are to be re|garded,
their <HI>religious</HI> and their <HI>civil</HI>
&s;tate.</P>
<P>&sect;. I. THAT they had, according to
the &s;acred writers, the free exerci&s;e of their religion,
is evident from the whole tenour of the hi&s;tory con|tained
in the <HI>Go&s;pels</HI> and the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</HI> They
had their Synagogues, the Law and the Prophets were
read there, our Saviour taught in the Synagogues.
Whenever he healed any Lepers, He <HI>bid</HI> them <HI>go and
<PB N="36" REF="52">
&s;hew</HI> them&s;elves <HI>to the Prie&s;ts, and offer the gift that</HI>
Mo&s;es <HI>commanded,</HI> Matth. viii. 4. Luke v. 14.</P>
<P>THERE appears to have been a great re&s;ort to the
Temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> from <HI>Galilee,</HI> and other parts,
at all their u&s;ual great Fea&s;ts. They were at full li|bertie
to make what contributions they &s;aw &s;it to
their &s;acred Trea&s;ury; [Mark xii. 41, 44. Luke xxi.
v. 1.] And &s;o &s;ecure were they, that they u&s;ed indirect
practi&s;es to enrich it. [<HI>Matth.</HI> xv. 5. <HI>Mark</HI> vii. 11, 12.]
There is no mention made in the hi&s;tory of our Savi|viour's
mini&s;try, of any re&s;traint, or ob&s;truction they
met with in their wor&s;hip, &s;ave that one of the <HI>Gali|leans,
who&s;e bloud</HI> Pilate <HI>had mingled with their Sacri|fices,</HI>
Luke xiii. 1.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. THAT they might thus freely perform all
the Services of their religion, tho' they be &s;uppo&s;ed to
have been then under the <HI>Roman</HI> Government, is not
at all improbable. For the <HI>Romans</HI> had ever permit|ted
the people they conquered to practi&s;e their own
religious rites in their own way: and &s;eem not to have
departed from this principle, till after the period of
the Evangelical Hi&s;tory. And that the <HI>Jews</HI> were now
at full liberty to wor&s;hip God, according to the in&s;ti|tutions
of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> we are a&s;&s;ured by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> who has
left us the hi&s;tory of the&s;e times. The <HI>Roman</HI> Pre&s;i|dents
did indeed, for &s;ome time, put in, and turn out
their High Prie&s;ts at Plea&s;ure. <HI>Valerius Gratus, Pi|late</HI>'s
Predece&s;&s;or, made &s;everal High Prie&s;ts, in the
time of his government<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ant. l. 18. c. ii.</NOTE>. The la&s;t High Prie&s;t he
made was <HI>Caiaphas;</HI> who continued in that office du|ring
all <HI>Pilate</HI>'s admini&s;tration. He being removed
from the Province, <HI>Vitellius,</HI> Pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria,</HI> put
in <HI>Jonathan</HI> the Son of <HI>Ananus</HI> or <HI>Annas</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. v. &sect;. 3.</NOTE>; and af|terward
<HI>Theophilus,</HI> another Son of <HI>Ananus,</HI> in the
room of <HI>Jonathan</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Cap. vi. &sect; 3.</NOTE>. But in this there was nothing
unu&s;ual or extraordinarie. <HI>Herod</HI> the Great and <HI>Ar|chelaus</HI>
had been wont, before this, to con&s;titute and
<PB N="37" REF="53">
remove the High Prie&s;ts at plea&s;ure<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ant 1. xx. cap. ix. fin.</NOTE>. <HI>Theophilus,</HI>
ju&s;t now mentioned, continued High Prie&s;t till <HI>Herod
Agrippa,</HI> [mentioned in the xii. <HI>Acts</HI>] then king of all
<HI>Judea</HI> di&s;placed him, and put <HI>Simon</HI> the Son of <HI>Boethus</HI>
into his room<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lib. xix. c. 6, &sect;. 2.</NOTE>. However this <HI>Herod</HI> was a <HI>Jew;</HI>
and from thence to the time the war broke out with
the <HI>Romans,</HI> the nomination of the High Prie&s;ts, and
the Government of the Temple, were committed to
Princes of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Religion, by the direction of the
<HI>Roman</HI> Emperours. After the death of <HI>Herod Agrip|pa,
Claudius</HI> inverted <HI>Herod</HI> King of <HI>Chalcis,</HI> brother
of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> with the&s;e powers<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Antiq. xx. cap. 1. &sect;. 3.</NOTE>. And after
his death, <HI>Agrippa</HI> the younger, &s;on of the &s;aid <HI>Herod
Agrippa</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 899. 1. 10.</NOTE>. And though they might all act &s;ome|what
arbitrarily in the nomination of the High Prie&s;ts,
yet they always confined their choice to tho&s;e who were
of the race of the Prie&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Roman</HI> Governours did indeed &s;ometimes of|fer
them abu&s;es, or &s;uffer abu&s;es to be committed in
the country contrarie to the in&s;titutions of the Law, as
they did al&s;o injure them in their civil properties. But
the&s;e abu&s;es &s;eem not to have been very numerous;
when any were committed, it was without the Empe|rour's
authority; and u&s;ually the <HI>Jews</HI> at length ob|tained
&s;atisfaction<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jo&s;eph. Antiq. xx. c. iv. &sect;. 3, 4.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS general view of the Religious State of the
<HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI> may &s;uffice at pre&s;ent. I &s;hall have oc|ca&s;ion
to enlarge more upon this Subject hereafter.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. THEIR <HI>civil</HI> &s;tate will require a more parti|cular
con&s;ideration in this place. It will be needful to
lay together a good number of texts, that the reader
may be able to judge what repre&s;entation the &s;acred
hi&s;torians have given of this matter. That it may be
done di&s;tinctly, I de&s;ire leave to divide their hi&s;tory in|to
four periods. The&s;e will &s;erve to relieve us in a di&s;|qui&s;ition,
which will be of &s;ome length. And perhaps
<PB N="38" REF="54">
we may have &s;ome other advantages, and receive &s;ome
clearer light into this matter, by this method, than
we &s;hould have otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>1. THE fir&s;t period reaches from the preaching of
<HI>John Bapti&s;t</HI> to our Saviour's Re&s;urrection.</P>
<P>II. THE &s;econd, from thence to the time of <HI>Herod</HI>
the King, mentioned <HI>Acts</HI> xii.</P>
<P>III. THE reign of this <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>IV. FROM the end of his reign to the conclu&s;ion
of the Evangelical Hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. I mu&s;t here premi&s;e, that in going over the
&s;everal pa&s;&s;ages of &s;cripture relating to this matter,
we are particularly to have our eye to a point in which
learned men are not entirely agreed, namely, what
power and authority the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation was now po&s;|&s;ed
of; and whether they had the power of life and
death; or only a right to inflict &s;ome le&s;&s;er penalties.</P>
<P>2. I would likewi&s;e ob&s;erve, that our enquirie here
will chiefly be confined to the State of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Ju|dea,</HI>
properly &s;o called. I have already &s;hewn (in
part at left) in the foregoing chapter, that St. <HI>Luke</HI>
has given a ju&s;t account of the &s;everal divi&s;ions of the
land of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> and of the Princes and Governours, to
whom they belonged: But now we are to con&s;ider the
power, which the <HI>Jews</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in <HI>Judea.</HI>
Therefore the beheading of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> is a fact,
that does not at pre&s;ent come particularly under our
Con&s;ideration. He was beheaded by <HI>Herod Tetrarch</HI>
of <HI>Galilee,</HI> Son of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great. And there can be
no doubt, but he had the power of life and death (how|ever
he abu&s;ed it) in his own territories.</P>
<P>3. I would al&s;o premi&s;e, that the Evangeli&s;ts are
not an&s;werable for the legality of all the facts they
have related. It's &s;aid that, <HI>all they in the Synagogue
when they heard the&s;e things, were filled with wrath,
and ro&s;e up and thru&s;t him</HI> [Je&s;us] <HI>out of the city</HI>
[Nazareth] <HI>and led him unto the browe of the hill
whereon their City was built, that they might ca&s;t him
down headlong,</HI> Luke iv. 28, 29.</P>

THE <HI>Jews</HI> are &s;aid to have taken up &s;tones to ca&s;t
at <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> more than once, [<HI>John</HI> viii. 59. x. 31, 33,
39.] and that in the Temple. It is al&s;o &s;aid, that
when <HI>Paul</HI> was <HI>about to &s;ail into</HI> Syria, from Greece,
<HI>the</HI> Jews <HI>laid wait for him,</HI> Acts xx. 3. So that he
was forced to alter his purpo&s;e, and go another way.
It can never be &s;uppo&s;ed that any of the&s;e attempts
were legal. It cannot be thought, that <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Te|trarch,</HI>
in who&s;e territories <HI>Nazareth</HI> was, permitted
the multitude to throw men off the precipice, when|ever
they did not like their Doctrine. Much le&s;s can
it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that &s;uch practi&s;es were allowed in any
places where the Government was in the hands of the
<HI>Romans,</HI> as it certainly was in <HI>Greece,</HI> if not al&s;o in
<HI>Judea.</HI> Such practi&s;es as the&s;e are never countenanced
by tho&s;e who are in authority. And if the <HI>Scribes</HI> and
<HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and the great men among the <HI>Jews</HI> had, at
this time, any principles that ju&s;tified and encouraged
fifth actions; and if they excited the common people
to them in <HI>Judea,</HI> as well as in other parts; it may be
reckoned an argument they had not the government
in their own hands, or the power of putting men to
death by their own authority, when they judged them
guilty. This ob&s;ervation may be of &s;ome u&s;e here|after.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. I &s;hall now proceed to con&s;ider the account
we meet with in the Evangeli&s;ts in the <HI>fir&s;t Period,</HI> from
the commencement of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t's</HI> mini&s;try to
the Re&s;urrection of our Saviour.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> has informed us, that when the word of
God came to <HI>John,</HI> in the fifteenth <HI>year of</HI> Tiberius,
Pontius Pilate <HI>was governour of</HI> Judea, <HI>and</HI> Annas <HI>and</HI>
Caiaphas <HI>were High Prie&s;ts,</HI> Luke iii. 1, 2. And all
the Evangeli&s;ts have a&s;&s;ured us, that our Saviour was
brought before <HI>Pilate</HI> and condemned by him. So
that [according to them] <HI>Pilate</HI> was Governour in
<HI>Judea,</HI> during the whole time of our Saviour's mini|&s;trie,
or the period we are now in. But becau&s;e the
power of this Governour is not particularly de&s;cribed by
<PB N="40" REF="56">
any of the Evangeli&s;ts, in order to judge what autho|rity
he had here, and what power <HI>Annas</HI> or <HI>Caiaphas,</HI>
or any other chief men among the <HI>Jews</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
of in this country, we mu&s;t ob&s;erve the di&s;cour&s;es,
proceedings, and events recorded by the &s;acred hi&s;to|rians,
which have any relation to this matter.</P>
<P>1. THE <HI>Jews</HI> appear to have been at liberty to
follow their own laws and cu&s;toms in mod matters,
particularly in the affair of marrirge and divorce, in
which they di&s;&s;ered con&s;iderably from many other
people.</P>
<P><HI>IT has been &s;aid, who&s;oever &s;hall put away his wife,
let him give her a writing of divorcement: but I &s;ay unto
you, that who&s;oever &s;hall put away his wife, &s;aving for
the cau&s;e of fornication cau&s;eth her to commit adultery:
and who&s;oever &s;hall marry her that is divorced, commit|teth
adultery,</HI> Matth. v. 31, 32. It is evident, from
the manner, in which our Lord condemns all divorces,
&s;ave tho&s;e made for the <HI>cau&s;e of fornication,</HI> that they
did at this time put them in practi&s;e upon other ac|counts.
This appears al&s;o from the que&s;tions put to
him [<HI>Matth.</HI> xix. 3, 10. <HI>Mark</HI> x. 2, 9.] concerning
this matter, and the an&s;wers he gave to them, and the
&s;urprize and unea&s;ine&s;s which the di&s;ciples expre&s;s at his
deci&s;ions, when he forbad &s;uch licentious divorces as
tho&s;e made <HI>for every cau&s;e; for they &s;aid unto him, if
the ca&s;e of the man be &s;o with his wife, it is not good to
marry.</HI></P>
<P>IT is &s;aid indeed, that when the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> brought
the&s;e que&s;tions, <HI>they came to him tempting him.</HI> But
there &s;eems not to have been any danger of giving of|fen&s;e
to the Roman Government, in this ca&s;e, which
way &s;o ever the que&s;tion was an&s;wered. The de&s;ign
could be only to expo&s;e him to the re&s;entment of the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people, by deci&s;ions contrary to practi&s;es they
indulged tnem&s;elves in, and were very fond of; as I
think appears likewi&s;e from the notice, the di&s;ciples
took of what he &s;aid upon this &s;ubject.</P>

Their <HI>Rabbies</HI> indulged them in the&s;e practi&s;es, and it
&s;eems, the <HI>Romans</HI> did not interrupt them.</P>
<P>2. <HI>OUR Lord &s;ays,</HI> [Matth. <HI>v.</HI> 21, 22.] Ye have
heard, that it was &s;aid by them of old time, <HI>[or, to the
ancients,]</HI> thou &s;halt not kill: and who&s;oever &s;hall kill,
&s;hall be in danger of the judgment. But I &s;ay unto you,
that who&s;oever is angry with his brother without a cau&s;e,
&s;hall be in danger of the judgment: and who&s;oever &s;hall
&s;ay to his brother, Racha, &s;hall be in danger of the
coun&s;el.</P>
<P><HI>GROTIUS</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Matth. v. 21.</NOTE> &s;uppo&s;es, that tho' the power of
inflicting capital puni&s;hments had been now for &s;ome
time taken away from the <HI>Jews;</HI> yet our Saviour al|ludes
to tho&s;e methods of proceeding, which had been
in u&s;e among them, and were &s;till fre&s;h in their me|mory.
Our Lord, I think, does not declare at all,
what power they now had, or made u&s;e of; but from
the mention of the words of their Law, and referring
perhaps to the &s;en&s;e in which they then under&s;tood it;
that they who committed murder de&s;erved puni&s;hment,
and that they who forbore that, were innocent, pro|ceeds
<PB N="42" REF="58">
to lay down a more &s;trict and pure morality. What
he delivers, in terms accommodated to their courts of
judicature, is certainly no repre&s;entation of their con|duct,
or the &s;tate of things, at that time. For it cannot
be thought, that every one who was angry with his
brother without a cau&s;e, was then in danger of the judg|ment,
[unle&s;s the word mean the judgment of God] or
that every one who &s;aid to his brother <HI>Racha,</HI> was in
danger of being brought by them before the Councel.</P>
<P>3. <HI>OUR Lord delivered many predictions concern|ing
the treatment, which his followers would meet
with.</HI> Therefore al&s;o &s;aid the wi&s;dom of God, I will &s;end
than prophets and apo&s;tles; and &s;ome of them they &s;hall
&s;lay and per&s;ecute, <HI>Luke xi.</HI> 49. Wherefore behold I &s;end
unto you prophets and wi&s;e men and Scribes; and &s;ome of
them &s;hall ye kill and crucifie, and &s;ome of them &s;hall ye
&s;courge in your Synagogues, and per&s;ecute them from Citie
to Citie, <HI>Matth. xx.</HI> 34. Take heed to your &s;elves, for
they &s;hall deliver you up to the councels: and in the Syna|gogues
ye &s;hall be beaten, and ye &s;hall be brought before
Rulers and Kings for my &s;ake, <HI>Mark xiii.</HI> 9. See <HI>John
xvi.</HI> 2.</P>
<P>THESE words of our Lord would, I think, be un|der&s;tood
by his hearers, agreeably to the &s;tate of
things at that time, whatever it was: tho&s;e puni&s;h|ments
which are purely <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> &s;uch as being &s;courg|ed
in their Synagogues, or driven from them, would
be under&s;tood to be inflicted by <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> hands. If the
<HI>Jews</HI> had not then the power of condemning men to
death, the capital puni&s;hments &s;poken of, as to be in|&s;licted
by them, would be under&s;tood to be brought
about by their means and procurement; unle&s;s it were
thought, that the words implied a prediction, that
they would have, &s;upreme power, though they now
had it not; and that then they would u&s;e it for the&s;e
purpo&s;es.</P>
<P>IT can never be inferred from hence, that they had
at this time &s;upreme power in <HI>Judea,</HI> or any where
el&s;e. It is very common to a&s;cribe to men, not only
<PB N="43" REF="59">
tho&s;e things they do them&s;elves, but tho&s;e al&s;o which
are brought about by their means. In all languages,
and in all countries, the puni&s;hment of an offender is
a&s;cribed to the pro&s;ecutor, the judge, and the execu|tioner,
tho' this la&s;t only put him to death in the
&s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e. Thus, it is certain that <HI>Pilate</HI> condem|ned
our Lord, and his officers crucified him: Yet the
<HI>Jews</HI> are more than once &s;aid to have crucified Chri&s;t,
becau&s;e his death was owing to their pro&s;ecution, and
importunity. <HI>Cleophas</HI> one of the di&s;ciples whom Je&s;us
met in the way to <HI>Emaus</HI> told him, <HI>how the chief
prie&s;ts, and our rulers delivered him to be condemned to
death and have</HI> CRUCIFIED <HI>him,</HI> Luke xxiv. 20. The
<HI>crucifying,</HI> as well as <HI>delivering up</HI> Je&s;us, is a&s;cribed to
the chief prie&s;ts. <HI>Peter</HI> &s;peaks to his hearers in this
manner: <HI>Ye men of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>hear the&s;e words; Je&s;us of</HI>
Nazareth, <HI>a man approved of God among you</HI>&mdash;<HI>Him ye
have taken, and by wicked hands have</HI> CRUCIFIED AND
SLAIN, <HI>Acts</HI> ii. 22, 23. Again, <HI>Peter, filled with the
Holy Gho&s;t, &s;aid unto them YE rulers of the people and
elders of</HI> I&s;rael._&mdash;<HI>Be it known unto you all, and to the
people of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>that by the name of Je&s;us of</HI> Nazareth,
<HI>whom YE crucified, does this man &s;tand here before you
whole,</HI> Ch. vi. 8, 10.</P>
<P>So <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, That <HI>Herod</HI> reigned thirty four
years after he had killed <HI>Antigonus</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Jo&s;eh. de Bell. lib. i. cap. 33, &sect;. 8. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. p. 770. v. 37.</NOTE>. Though every
one knows, it was <HI>Mark Antony</HI> who beheaded <HI>Anti|gonus,</HI>
at the reque&s;t of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>AND not only is this &s;tile u&s;ed in relating facts that
have already happened, but al&s;o in predicting tho&s;e
that are future. <HI>Then &s;aid Je&s;us unto them: When</HI> YE
HAVE LIFT UP <HI>the Son of man,</HI> &amp;c. [John viii. 28.]
Though at other times, when he &s;peaks of his death,
he repre&s;ents the &s;hare they would have in it, more di|&s;tinctly.
<HI>Saying, Behold we go up to</HI> Jeru&s;alem: <HI>and
<PB N="44" REF="60">
the Son of man &s;hall be delivered unto the chief prie&s;ts.&mdash;.
and they &s;hall condemn</HI> HIM TO DEATH AND SHALL DE|LIVER
HIM TO THE GENTILES, <HI>Mark</HI> x. 33.</P>
<P>IN like manner, he thus repre&s;ents the &s;ufferings his
followers would be expo&s;ed to. <HI>Now the brother &s;hall
betray the brother to death, and the father the &s;on: and
the children &s;hall ri&s;e up again&s;t their parents, and &s;hall
cau&s;e them to be put to death, [<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,] and
&s;hall put them to death,</HI> Mark xiii. 12. It never was <HI>le|gal,</HI>
according to any con&s;titution in the world, for
children in a private capacitie to put their parents to
death. And this phra&s;e is to be explained by tho&s;e that
go before, of <HI>betraying</HI> or <HI>delivering,</HI> that is, accu&s;ing,
and pro&s;ecuting them, that they may be put to death.</P>
<P>IN all the&s;e places then our Lord would be under|&s;tood
by his hearers, according to the quality of the
per&s;ons &s;poken of, and the &s;tate of affairs at that
time, whatever it was.</P>
<P><HI>THE</HI> per&s;ecuting from city to city <HI>is no argument of
&s;upreme power any where.</HI> The <HI>Jews, [at</HI> Antioch <HI>in</HI>
Pi&s;idia] &s;tirred up the devout and honourable women, and
the chief men of the city, and rai&s;ed perfection again&s;t
<HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Barnabas,</HI> and expelled them out of their coa&s;ts,
<HI>Acts xiii. 50. Again, the &s;ame thing happened at</HI>
Iconium. But the multitude of the City was divided, and
part held with the <HI>Jews,</HI> and part with the apo&s;tles. And
when there was an a&s;&s;ault made both of the <HI>Gentiles,</HI>
and al&s;o of the <HI>Jews</HI>&mdash;they were ware of it, and fled unto
<HI>Ly&s;tra</HI> and <HI>Derbe,</HI> Acts <HI>xiv.</HI> 4, 6. And in many ci|ties,
&s;ituated undoubtedly in countries &s;ubject to the
Roman juri&s;diction, but in which the <HI>Jews</HI> had &s;ettle|ments,
did they foment di&s;turbances again&s;i the Apo|&s;tles,
and thus drive them from place to place.</P>
<P>FARTHER, our Lord bid his di&s;ciples to <HI>beware of
men: for they will deliver you up to the councels, and they
will &s;courge you in their Synagogues,</HI> Matth. x. 17. xxiii.
34. It mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed, &s;ince the <HI>Jews</HI> had the free
exerci&s;e of their religion, and we often read of the Ru|ler
of the Synagogue, that the expelling from the Sy|nagogue,
<PB N="45" REF="61">
and beating in the Synagogues were puni&s;h|ments
purely <HI>Jewi&s;h,</HI> and that they inflicted the&s;e pe|nalties
by their own proper authority. The <HI>Jews</HI> a|greed,
in our Saviour's life time, that <HI>if any man did
confe&s;s that he was the Chri&s;t, he &s;hould be put out of the
Synagogue,</HI> John ix. 22. This was a decree of theirs;
and they did actually <HI>ca&s;t out,</HI> or excommunicate the
man, that had been cured of his blindne&s;s, <HI>ver.</HI> 34.
St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aies, that before his conver&s;ion, <HI>He beat in
every Synagogue them that believed in Je&s;us,</HI> Acts xxiii.
19. Nay, as they had &s;ettlements in many parts, and
were protected by the laws in the exerci&s;e of their re|ligion,
it's not unlikely that they inflicted this pun&s;h|ment
al&s;o out of <HI>Judea.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aies, <HI>Of the? Jews
received I five times forty &s;tripes &s;ave one,</HI> 2 Cor. xi. 24.
He u&s;ually made &s;o &s;hort a &s;tay when he came into
<HI>Judea,</HI> the &s;everal times he was there after his conver|&s;ion,
that its mo&s;t likely the&s;e &s;courgings had happen|ed,
mo&s;t or all of them in &s;ome other countrie. <HI>Epi|phanius,</HI>
who lived in the fourth Centurie, informs us,
that one <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> a <HI>Jew,</HI> whom he knew, having re|ceived
a Book of the Go&s;pels from a Chri&s;tian Bi&s;hop,
and being &s;urprized by &s;ome of his countrymen, when
he was reading it, they took the book out of his hands
with great violence, threw him on the ground, &startq;drag'd
him to the Synagogue and there beat him.&endq;<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Epiph. 1. i. Tom. ii. c. xi. Haere&s;. 30. Vid. etiam Grot, ad Matth, x. 17.</NOTE></P>
<P>URIEL <HI>Aco&s;ta</HI> &s;uffered this puni&s;hment in the
Synagogue at <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> in the la&s;t century, of which
he has him&s;elf publi&s;hed a curious relation<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Vid. Limborch. Amic, Collat. p. 349, 350.</NOTE>. This
therefore mu&s;t be reckoned one of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er penal|ties,
which they had a right to inflict in <HI>Judea,</HI> and
po&s;&s;ibly out of it.</P>
<P>4. THE Que&s;tion brought to our Saviour about
Tribute [<HI>Matth.</HI> xxii. 15, 20.] is remarkable. <HI>Then
went the</HI> Phari&s;ees, <HI>and took Coun&s;el how they might en|tangle
him in his talk; and they &s;ent out their di&s;ciples&mdash;Saying,
<PB N="46" REF="62">
We know that thou teache&s;t the way of God in
truth&mdash;Is it lawful to give tribute to</HI> Ce&s;ar <HI>or not? But
Je&s;us perceived their wickedne&s;s,</HI> [Craftine&s;s, <HI>Luke</HI> xx.
23.] <HI>and &s;aid, why tempt ye me, ye hypocrites; &s;hew me
the tribute money. And they brought him a peny: and he
&s;aith unto them, who&s;e is this image and &s;uper&s;cription? And
they &s;ay unto him,</HI> Ce&s;ar's. This is a proof the Empe|rour's
coin was current among them, and that they
paid tribute to him. St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s introduction to this
&s;tory is in the&s;e words: <HI>And they watched him, and &s;ent
forth &s;pies, which &s;hould feign them&s;elves ju&s;t men, that
they might take hold of his words, that &s;o they might deli|ver
him unto the power and authority of the Governour,</HI>
Luke xx. 20.</P>
<P>5. <HI>IN the viii chapter of St.</HI> John <HI>we have another
en&s;naring que&s;tion put to our Saviour.</HI> The <HI>Scribes</HI>
and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> brought unto him a woman taken in adulterie:
and when they &s;et her in the mid&s;t, they &s;ay unto him, Ma|&s;ter,
this Woman was taken in adulterie, in the very act:
Now <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> in the Law commanded us, that &s;uch &s;hould
be &s;toned; but what &s;aye&s;t thou<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">It is well known, there are very &s;trong objections brought by learned men again&s;t the genuinene&s;&s;e of this paragraph of St. John's Go&s;pel concerning the woman taken in Adulterie, Vid.

was an en&s;naring que&s;tion, for St.</HI> John <HI>adds,</HI> ver. 6.
This they &s;aid tempting him, that they might have to ac|cu&s;e

<P>THE Speech they made &s;eems to me very artful,

their que&s;tion an&s;wered. But they &s;eem to have &s;ugge&s;t|ed
the &s;tronge&s;t rea&s;ons they could, again&s;t his deter|mining,
that they might not &s;tone her. Perhaps there|fore,
they wi&s;hed he would &s;ay, they ought to obey the
Law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> Now, if the <HI>Romans</HI> did not allow them
at that time to inflict this puni&s;hment in this ca&s;e
here would have been matter of accu&s;ation before the
Governour, if the que&s;tion were &s;o re&s;olved by him.</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="63">
OUR Lord however gives a mo&s;t &s;urprizing, and
unlooked for deci&s;ion. <HI>So when they continued asking
him, he lift up him&s;elf, and &s;aid unto them, He that is
without &s;in, let him ca&s;t the fir&s;t &s;tone at her,</HI> ver. 7. <HI>And
they which heard it, being convicted by their own con&s;cience,

on the Sabbath day, the</HI> Phari&s;ees held a councel again&s;t
him, how they might de&s;troy him, <HI>Matth. xii. 14. The
man that had been cured by him at the pool of</HI> Beth|e&s;da,
<HI>having told the</HI> Jews, <HI>that it was</HI> Je&s;us that had
made him whole, <HI>it is &s;aid,</HI> therefore did the <HI>Jews</HI> per&s;e|cute
Je&s;us, and &s;ought to &s;lay him, becau&s;e he had done
the&s;e things on the Sabbath day. But Je&s;us an&s;wered them,
my father worketh hitherto, and I work. Therefore the
Jews &s;ought the more to kill him, becau&s;e he not only had
broken the Sabbath, but &s;aid al&s;o, that God was his fa|ther,
making him&s;elf equal with God. <HI>[John v.</HI> 15, 18.]
After the&s;e things, Je&s;us walked in <HI>Galilee:</HI> for he would
not walk in <HI>Jewry,</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ought to kill him,
[<HI>Ch. vii. I.</HI>]&mdash;Then &s;aid &s;ome of them of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> Is
not this he whom they feel to kill? [<HI>ver.</HI> 25.] The <HI>Phari|&s;ees</HI>
heard that the people murmured &s;uch things concerning
him: and the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and chief prie&s;ts &s;ent officers to
take him: [<HI>ver.</HI> 32.] Therefore they &s;ought again to take
him: but he e&s;caped out of their hands, [<HI>Ch. x.</HI> 39.] <HI>Af|ter
he had rai&s;ed</HI> Lazarus, <HI>&s;ome of them that were by</HI>

things Je&s;us had done. Then gathered the chief prie&s;ts
and the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> a councel, and &s;aid, what do we?
For this man does many miracles, [<HI>Ch. xi.</HI> 45, 47.]
Then from that day forth they took coun&s;el together for
to put him to death, [<HI>ver.</HI> 53.] But the chief prie&s;ts con|&s;ulted,
that they might put Lazarus al&s;o to death, [<HI>Ch.

<P>7. BUT the actual apprehending, trial, and pro&s;e|cution
of Je&s;us, is the mo&s;t particular, and material
in&s;tance of their authority in this period. And, if I
mi&s;take not, the method of proceeding in this affair
does explain the nature of all tho&s;e de&s;igns hitherto

clande&s;tine or tumultuous attempts.</P>

that they might take Je&s;us by &s;ubtilty, and kill him.
[<HI>Matth. xxvi.</HI> 3, 4.] Then one of the twelve, called <HI>Ju|das

<HI>This I may &s;hew more particularly hereafter, but now

<P>THESE are the proceedings of the council, whil&s;t
Je&s;us was before them.</P>
<P>WHEN the morning was corns, all the chief prie&s;ts,

<HI>HAVING heard from them what things they had
to lay to his charge,</HI> Pilate <HI>examin'd</HI> Je&s;us: having &s;o
<HI>done,</HI> he &s;aid to the chief prie&s;ts and the people, I find no
fault in this man, and they were the more fierce, &s;aying,
he &s;tirreth up the people, teaching throughout all <HI>Jury,</HI>
beginning from <HI>Galilee</HI> to this place. [<HI>Luke xxiii.</HI> 4&mdash;8.]
When <HI>Pilate</HI> heard of Galilee, <HI>he &s;ent</HI> Je&s;us to Herod
<HI>who was then at</HI> Jeru&s;alem.&mdash;<HI>He having mock'd him
&s;ent him again to</HI> Pilate. <HI>Being therefore again re|turned
to him,</HI> Pilate, when he had called together the
chief prie&s;ts and the rulers, and the people, &s;aid unto them,
Ye have brought this man unto me as one that perverteth
the people: and behold, I having examined him before
you, have found no fault in this man, touching tho&s;e things
whereof you accu&s;e him. No, nor yet <HI>Herod</HI>&mdash;I will
therefore cha&s;ti&s;e him and relea&s;e him. [<HI>v.</HI> 13&mdash;16] They
Sunil
de&s;ired that he would rather relea&s;e Barabbas; Pilate
therefore willing to releafe <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> &s;pake again to them: but
they cried, faying, Crucifie him, Crucifie him. And he
[aid unto them the third time, Why what evil has he done?
I have found no cau&s;e of death in him: I will therefore
chafti&s;e him and let him go. And they were in&s;tant with
loud voices, requiring that he might be crucified, and the
voices of them, and of the chief prie&s;ts prevailed, and
<HI>Pilate</HI> gave &s;entence, that it &s;hould be as they required.
[<HI>ver.</HI> 17&mdash;24.]</P>
<P>A few remarks will be needful. The <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> councel
having judged that Je&s;us was guilty of death, or that
according to their law he de&s;erved to die, they carry
him to <HI>Pilate,</HI> and produce their charges again&s;t him.
It's &s;urprizing that they &s;hould do this, if they had
them&s;elves the power of life and death. A people
fond of authority and power would not have commit|ted
to a foreigner a cau&s;e that was within their own
juri&s;diction. If they had not the power of life and
death in this ca&s;e, they had it not in any other. For
the only crime, that Je&s;us was &s;uppo&s;ed to be convict|ed
of before them, was that of <HI>bla&s;phemy,</HI> or a&s;&s;uming
without foundation the character of the Me&s;&s;ias. The
<PB N="52" REF="68">
Evangeli&s;ts are extremely unanimous in this point:
<HI>That the high prie&s;ts, and all the council &s;ought fal&s;e wit|ne&s;s
again&s;t him but found none, yea, though many fal&s;e
witne&s;s came, yet found they none,</HI> Matth. xxvi. 59,
60. <HI>Many bare fal&s;e witne&s;s again&s;t him, but their wit|ne&s;s
agreed not together,</HI> Mark xiv. 56. St. <HI>Matthew</HI>
[Ch. xxvi. 63&mdash;66.] St. <HI>Mark</HI> [Ch. xiv. 60&mdash;64.] St.
<HI>Luke</HI> [Ch. xxii. 69&mdash;71.] have particularly informed
us, that the condemnation pa&s;&s;ed by the council upon
Je&s;us was founded upon the declaration he made, that
he was the Chri&s;t, when the High Prie&s;t had adjured him
to tell them who he was. And St. <HI>John</HI> [Ch. xix. 7.]
&s;aies, this was what they in&s;i&s;ted on before <HI>Pilate: We
Lave a law, and by our law he ought to die, becau&s;e he
made him&s;elf the Son of God.</HI> As therefore the only fact,
which they had the proof of, was that of our Lord's
own confe&s;&s;ion made before them, which they called
bla&s;phemy; if they had had the power of inflicting
death in this ca&s;e, they would have puni&s;hed him ac|cordingly,
by their own authority, and not have car|ried
him to <HI>Pilate.</HI></P>
<P>THEY did indeed accu&s;e him before <HI>Pilate of many
things,</HI> and &s;aid, <HI>he &s;tirred up the people,</HI> and the like.
But the&s;e appear to have been merely malicious in|ventions
of their own, without any ground in the le&s;t
from any action they knew of, or that had been
proved, when he was under examination before them:
or el&s;e, were conclu&s;ions they pretended to draw, and
in&s;inuated to the Governour, mu&s;t be the con&s;e|quence
of Je&s;us's confe&s;&s;ion and declaration, <HI>that
he was the Chri&s;t.</HI> And it &s;eems to me, that this
declaration of his was the only ground of all the&s;e
charges, from what St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;aies, <HI>and they began
to accu&s;e him, &s;aying, we found this fellow perverting
the nation, and forbidding to give tribute to Ce&s;ar, &s;ay|ing,</HI>
THAT HE HIMSELF IS CHRIST A KING, <HI>Luke</HI>
xxiii. 2; as al&s;o from what St. <HI>John</HI> relates: <HI>The</HI> Jews
cried, <HI>&s;aying, if thou let this man go thou art not</HI> Ce&s;ar's
<HI>friend: Where&s;oever</HI> MAKETH HIMSELF A KIKG, <HI>&s;peak|eth
<PB N="53" REF="69">
again&s;t</HI> Ce&s;ar, <HI>John</HI> xix. 13. As likewi&s;e, becau&s;e
that this was the thing, which <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;eems more e&s;pe|cially
to have informed him&s;elf about. For he asked
him, <HI>Art thou the King of the</HI> Jews, <HI>John</HI> xvii. 33.
Where we have the an&s;wer that Je&s;us returned him|to
<HI>ver.</HI> 38. <HI>Pilate</HI> perceiving there was nothing cri|minal
in this preten&s;ion of Je&s;us, went out again un|to
the <HI>Jews,</HI> and &s;aith unto them; <HI>I find in him no
fault at all.</HI> There being no crime in this, he was
fully &s;atisfied of his innocence.</P>
<P>PERHAPS, it will be objected again&s;t this, that
the title &s;et upon the Cro&s;s, of <HI>Je&s;us</HI> of Nazareth,
<HI>King of the</HI> Jews, is a proof the crime he was condem|ned
for by <HI>Pilate</HI> was that of &s;edition, or High Trea|&s;on.
But I think, this is no proof of any &s;uch thing.
For, <HI>Pilate</HI> judging, that our Saviour was really inno|cent,
[&s;ince it was the Roman Cu&s;tom to put &s;ome
title,] might write what he plea&s;ed. And our Lord
had &s;atisfied <HI>Pilate,</HI> there was nothing &s;editious in
that claim he made under that character, fora&s;much
as his Kingdome was not of this world. But I contend
not about this. It is not at all material what was the
pretended crime for which <HI>Pilate</HI> at la&s;t condemned
Je&s;us.</P>
<P>BLASPHEMY was the only crime, of which Je&s;us
was &s;uppo&s;ed to be convicted before the Councel; and
yet the&s;e Jewi&s;h High Prie&s;ts and Elders carried him
to the Governour; and it appears from the &s;equel,
that <HI>Pilate</HI> was the &s;upreme Judge in this cau&s;e, and
the matter of the event. For he gives the ca&s;e a fre&s;h
hearing, a&s;ks the Jews what accu&s;ation they brought,
examined Je&s;us; and when he had done &s;o, told them,
he <HI>found in him no fault at all.</HI> This his conduct is a
full proof that He was the Judge, and that they were
only pro&s;ecutors and accu&s;ers.</P>
<P>PILATE indeed propo&s;es to them, which he
&s;hould relea&s;e to them, <HI>Barabbas,</HI> or Je&s;us. But cer|tainly,
he does not appeal to them as Judges. This
is evident from the Per&s;ons, to whom he addre&s;&s;ed
<PB N="54" REF="70">
him&s;elf with this propo&s;al, namely, the <HI>people,</HI> the
<HI>multitude;</HI> which never had, among the <HI>Jews,</HI> a legal
power of life and death. <HI>At that Fea&s;t the Governour
was wont to relea&s;e unto the</HI> PEOPLE <HI>a pri&s;oner, whom
they would,</HI> Matth. xxviii. 15. <HI>Therefore when they
were gathered together,</HI> Pilate <HI>&s;aid unto them, Whom
will ye that I relea&s;e unto you,</HI> ver. 17. <HI>But the chief
prie&s;ts and elders per&s;uaded the</HI> MULTITUDE <HI>that they
&s;hould a&s;k</HI> Barabbas <HI>and de&s;troy Je&s;us,</HI> ver. 20. <HI>See</HI>
Mark xv. 8&mdash;15. This appeal to the <HI>people</HI> &s;eems to
have been only to di&s;cern how far he might act in this
matter con&s;i&s;tent with the peace of the province, which
depended upon the di&s;po&s;ition of the people.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, <HI>Pilate</HI> at length pronounced the
Sentence. He wrote the <HI>Title</HI> upon the Cro&s;s, and
would not alter what he had written, though de&s;ired
by the high prie&s;ts, <HI>John</HI> xix. 19. When the Sentence
was pronounced, [<HI>Matth.</HI> xxvii. 27, 28.] the <HI>Soldiers
of the Governour took Je&s;us into the common Hall, and
gathered unto them the whole band of Soldiers, and they
&s;tripped him, and put on him a &s;carlet Robe, and led him
away to crucify him,</HI>&mdash;31. The crucifixion was per|formed
by the&s;e Soldiers under the command of a Cen|turion,
&mdash;54. Jo&s;eph of Arimathea <HI>went to</HI> PILATE
<HI>and begged the body of Je&s;us. Then</HI> PILATE <HI>commanded
the body to be delivered,</HI>&mdash;58. <HI>The chief Prie&s;ts and
Phari&s;ees came to</HI> PILATE, <HI>de&s;iring that he would com|mand
that the Sepulchre be made &s;ure until the third day&mdash;</HI>
Pilate <HI>&s;aid unto them, ye have a watch, go your way,
make it as &s;ure as ye can. So they went and made the Se|pulchre
&s;ure, &s;ealing the &s;tone, and &s;etting a watch,&mdash;66.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THESE Soldiers were entirely accountable to</HI> Pilate.
<HI>For when</HI> &s;ome of the watch came into the City &s;hewed
unto the chief prie&s;ts all the things that were done&mdash;they
gave large money unto the Soldiers, &s;aying, &s;ay ye, his
di&s;ciples came by night and &s;tole him away while we &s;lept:
And if this come to the <HI>GOVERNOUR's</HI> ears, we will per|&s;uade
<HI>HIM</HI> and &s;ecure you, <HI>Matth. xxviii.</HI> 11&mdash;14.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="71">
BESIDE the light we receive into this matter from
the proceedings relating to our Saviour him&s;elf; we
learn that <HI>Pilate</HI> had in his cu&s;tody divers pri&s;oners,
which were of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Nation: for it could be &s;uch
only, that it can be &s;uppo&s;ed, they &s;hould de&s;ire to

crying aloud, began to de&s;ire him to do as he had
ever done unto them,</HI> Mark xv. 8. <HI>See</HI> Matth. xxvii. 15.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;aid unto them, TAKE YE HIM, <HI>and
judge him according to your Law. The Jews &s;aid unto
him,</HI> IT IS NOT LAWFUL FOR US TO PUT ANY MAN
TO DEATH, <HI>John</HI> xviii. 31.</P>
<P>As <HI>they</HI> here affirm expre&s;ly, that they had not the
power of life and death; &s;o <HI>Pilate</HI> told our Saviour
that He had. <HI>Then</HI> Pilate <HI>&s;aid unto him,&mdash;knowe&s;t thou
not, that I have Power to crucify thee, and have power to
relea&s;e thee,</HI> John xix. 10.</P>
<P>So that the whole cour&s;e of the proceedings in this
tran&s;action, and the&s;e expre&s;s declarations of the&s;e two
parties, the High Prie&s;ts and Elders on the one hand,
and <HI>Pilate</HI> on the other, a&s;&s;ure us, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> na|tion
had not, at this time, within them&s;elves, the power
of life and death, upon any occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>&sect;. VI. BUT yet, there are &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of the
Evangeli&s;ts relating to this matter that may require
con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>1. <HI>THERE is a prediction of our Lord concerning
the manner of his death related by</HI> John,<HI>[Ch. xii. 32.]
with the Evangeli&s;t's own reflexion:</HI> And I, if I be
lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.
This he &s;aid &s;ignifying what death he &s;hould die. St. John
[Ch. xviii. 31, 33.] Then <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;aid unto them take ye
him, and judge him according to your Law. The <HI>Jews</HI>
therefore &s;aid unto him, It is not lawful for us to pit
any man to death. That the &s;aying of Je&s;us might be
fulfilled, which he &s;pake, &s;ignifying what death he
&s;hould die.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="72">
POSSIBLY, &s;ome may hence conclude, that the
<HI>Jews</HI> had the power o&s; putting men to death; and
therefore the Evangeli&s;t ob&s;erves, that the fulfilment
of this prediction was remarkable: Since though they
had the power yet they di&s;claim'd, and would not
exerci&s;e it upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT without this &s;uppo&s;ition, the accompli&s;hment
of this prediction is remarkable on two accounts.
<HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> In that he did not die a natural death; and
<HI>Secondly,</HI> That He was not put to death in a tumult;
but his death was the re&s;ult of a legal proce&s;&s;e ac|cording
to the form of government which then ob|tained
in that country. No man, without a prophe|tic
Spirit, could fore&s;ee certainly, that he &s;hould not
die a natural death; and yet, perhaps it was more
extraordinary to fore&s;ee, that he &s;hould e&s;cape all the
&s;udden attempts upon his life. We have many of
the&s;e recorded in the Evangeli&s;ts: But notwi&s;tand|ing
he &s;uffered as a criminal by the &s;entence of the
government.</P>
<P>AND the meaning of the Evangeli&s;ts in the la&s;t
mentioned place, I think, is this: The <HI>Jews</HI> &s;aid, It
is not lawful for us to put any man to death; and
hereby, <HI>i. e.</HI> by their not having the power of inflict|ing
capital puni&s;hments, it came to pa&s;s, that the
words of Je&s;us were fulfilled, in which he had pre|dicted,
that he &s;hould <HI>be crucified,</HI> that being a <HI>Roman</HI>
and not an ordinary <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> puni&s;hment.</P>
<P>2. PERHAPS, &s;ome may think their departing
willingly at this time from their right is implied in
the phra&s;e, <HI>delivering up to the</HI> Gentiles; which our
Lord made u&s;e of &s;ome times, when he &s;poke of his
death. <HI>Behold we go up to</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and the Son of
man &s;hall be delivered unto the chief Prie&s;ts, and unto the
Scribes; and they &s;hall condemn him to death, and &s;hall</HI>
DELIVER <HI>him to the</HI> Gentiles; <HI>Mark</HI> x. 33. <HI>See Luke</HI>
xviii. 32. and after the councel had condemned Je&s;us,
<HI>it is &s;aid, when they had bound him, they led him away,
<PB N="57" REF="73">
and</HI> DELIVERED <HI>him to</HI> Pontius Pilate <HI>the Governour,</HI>
Matth. xxvii. 2.</P>
<P>HEREBY &s;ome may be plea&s;ed to under&s;tand, that
for &s;ome rea&s;ons the <HI>Jews</HI> voluntarily &s;urrendered him
to <HI>Pilate;</HI> tho' if they had thought fit, they might
have put him to death them&s;elves.</P>
<P>BUT this is not the meaning of this word in the <HI>New
Te&s;tament,</HI> as is evident from <HI>Mark</HI> x. 33. the fir&s;t text
here quoted. <HI>Judas,</HI> of whom that <HI>delivery to the chief
prie&s;ts</HI> is intended, relea&s;ed no right. The word is often
u&s;ed to expre&s;s the acts of private per&s;ons, who accu|&s;ed,
pro&s;ecuted, betraied, or any other way contri|buted
to the bringing another before a court of Ju|&s;tice,
in order to be condemned and put to death.
<HI>But beware of Men, for they will</HI> DELIVER <HI>you up to the
councels, and they will &s;courge you in their Synagogues,
and ye &s;hall be brought before governours and kings for
my &s;ake&mdash;but when they</HI> DELIVER <HI>you up, take no
thought, how, or what ye &s;hall &s;peak.&mdash;And the bro|ther
&s;hall</HI> DELIVER <HI>the brother to death, and the father
the child,</HI> Matth. x. 17&mdash;21 <HI>But when they &s;hall lead
you and</HI> DELIVER <HI>you up, take no thought before hand,</HI>
Mark xiii. II. and in the next ver&s;e <HI>betraying</HI> is u&s;ed
for <HI>delivering. Now the brother</HI> &s;hall <HI>betray the brother,
and the father the Son.</HI></P>
<P>3. <HI>BUT &s;till &s;ome may &s;u&s;pect that they might
have &s;ome particular rea&s;ons, for not employing at
this time all the authority they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of. For
St.</HI> Luke [Ch. xxii. 2.] &s;aies, And the chief Prie&s;ts and
Scribes &s;ought how they might kill him, for they feared
the people. <HI>And St.</HI> Matthew, [Ch. xxvi. 4, 5.] that
they con&s;ulted that they might take Je&s;us by &s;ubtilty, and
kill him. But they &s;aid, not on the fea&s;t day le&s;t there be
an uproar among the people. <HI>Po&s;&s;ibly therefore, &s;u&s;|pecting
the affections of the people, they might be
willing to decline the odium of this action, and throw
it upon</HI> Pilate.</P>
<P>BUT whatever apprehen&s;ions they might have
concerning the <HI>people,</HI> at fir&s;t; yet when they had
<PB N="58" REF="74">
&s;ei&s;ed Je&s;us without any di&s;turbance, and many had
&s;hewn their forwardne&s;&s;e in coming in to them, and
bringing them fal&s;e accu&s;ations again&s;t him, the&s;e
fears might then be pretty well over. And certainly,
they could be in no fear of the people, after the mul|titude
had unanimou&s;ly demanded with loud voices,
that <HI>Barabbas</HI> might he relea&s;ed, and Je&s;us crucified.
For that offer which <HI>Pilate</HI> made them, <HI>&s;aying, take
ye him and crucify him,</HI> John xix. 6. was plainly after
that the people had petitioned for <HI>Barabbas. Then
cried they all again, &s;aying not this man but</HI> Barabbas,
Ch. xviii. 40. If they could have put any man to
death, would not they now have joyfully accepted
this offer which <HI>Pilate</HI> made them? Would they not
have been willing now to merit with the people, by
putting to death a man whom they di&s;liked as well as
them&s;elves, if before, they were afraid to kill one,
whom they &s;u&s;pected the people were fond of?</P>
<P>4. AND this brings me to another difficulty. For
it may be &s;aid; If the <HI>Jews</HI> had not the power of life
and death, what could <HI>Pilate</HI> mean, by &s;aying, <HI>Take
ye him, and judge him according to your Law?</HI> John
xviii. 31. And again, <HI>Take ye him and crucify him, for
I find no fault in him?</HI> Ch. xix. 6.</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that <HI>Pilate's</HI> meaning in the fir&s;t. place is
very evident, and the an&s;wer they make him &s;hews,
they had not the power of life and death. The con|text
is thus: <HI>Then led they Je&s;us from</HI> Caiaphas <HI>unto
the hall of judgment.</HI> They &s;crupling to go in, Pilate
<HI>went out unto them, and &s;aid, what accu&s;ation bring you
again&s;t this man? They an&s;wered and &s;aid unto him, if
he were not a malefactour we would not have delivered
him up unto thee. Then &s;aid</HI> Pilate, <HI>take ye him and
judge him according to your Law,</HI> that is, Go then and
puni&s;h him your &s;elves. <HI>The</HI> Jews <HI>therefore &s;aid unto
him, It is not lawful for us to put any man to death,</HI> [John
xviii. 28&mdash;31.] that is, &startq;This is a criminal we can|not
puni&s;h according to his de&s;erts. 'Tis not one
of the le&s;&s;er faults, for which we are wont to &s;courge
<PB N="59" REF="75">
men, or to ca&s;t out of the Synagogue; but he is
guilty of bla&s;phemy, which by our Law ought to
be puni&s;hed with death. And &s;ince we are not
permitted to puni&s;h any man capitally, we have
brought him to your tribunal, where alone we can
have &s;atisfaction.&endq;</P>
<P>THE other words are thus introduced: <HI>Pilate</HI> had
&s;courged Je&s;us, platted a crown of thorns upon him,
and offered him other indignities, hoping hereby to
pacifie the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> rage, and &s;ave his life: and goes
out <HI>and &s;aith unto them, behold I bring him forth to you,
that you? may know that I find no fault in him:</HI> he is an
innocent man, and I cannot puni&s;h him as you de&s;ire.
<HI>When the chief Prie&s;ts therefore, and Officers &s;aw him,
they cried out &s;aying, crucifie him, crucifie him.</HI> Pilate
<HI>&s;aith unto them, Take ye him and crucifie him, for I find
no fault in him,</HI> John xix. 1&mdash;6. It's not unlikely,
that &s;ome may &s;uppo&s;e, the word <HI>crucifie</HI> here, ought
to be interpreted by the general word <HI>judge,</HI> u&s;ed be|fore.
But I think, the mo&s;t natural meaning of <HI>Pi|late's</HI>
words here is this. &startq;You mu&s;t crucifie him
then your &s;elves, if you can commit &s;uch a villany,
for I cannot. He appears to me innocent, as I
have told you already; and I have now puni&s;hed
him as much, or more than he de&s;erves.&endq;</P>
<P>THE an&s;wer they make again goes upon the Sup|po&s;ition,
that they could not take away any man's
life. <HI>The</HI> Jews <HI>an&s;wered him, we have a law, and by
our law he ought to die, becau&s;e he made him&s;elf the Son
of God,</HI> ver. 7. that is, &startq;Indeed, Sir, you need not
be &s;o &s;crupulous: He is a bla&s;phemer; and by
our law all &s;uch ought to be put to death. And
if you do not condemn him to death, we &s;hall
think you do not pay that re&s;pect to our law which
you ought to do&endq;. And then they threaten him
with the general re&s;entment of the nation, if he would
not puni&s;h capitally the mo&s;t heinous violation of
their law.

THIS di&s;cour&s;e, which now pa&s;&s;ed between <HI>Pilate</HI>
and the chief prie&s;ts, is a proof, they had not the
power of life and death; and that the intent of what
<HI>Pilate</HI> &s;aid, is not, that they might crucifie him if
they plea&s;ed: If this had been <HI>Pilate</HI>'s meaning, and
they could have legally executed Je&s;us, would they
have put a matter they were intent upon to an un|certain
i&s;&s;ue? would they have refu&s;ed to take the
cau&s;e into their own hands, when they &s;aw the Gover|nour
was backward to gratify their intentions? Their
&s;till pre&s;&s;ing <HI>Pilate</HI> to pronounce a Sentence of death
is a proof, that they knew very well, if Je&s;us was not
condemned by <HI>Pilate,</HI> he mu&s;t be &s;et at liberty.</P>
<P>5. BUT though the&s;e particulars, thus laid toge|ther,
appear deci&s;ive, and the <HI>Jews</HI> here, in a mo&s;t
critical Sea&s;on, &s;ay expre&s;ly that it was <HI>not lawful for
them to put any man to death;</HI> yet in another place,
there are &s;ome <HI>Jews,</HI> who &s;eem to a&s;&s;ert, they had at
this time an ab&s;olute freedom. Then <HI>&s;aid Je&s;us unto
the</HI> Jews <HI>which believed on him, if ye continue in my
words, then are ye my di&s;ciples indeed. And ye &s;hall
know the truth, and the truth &s;hall make you free. They
an&s;wered him, we be</HI> Abraham'<HI>s Seed,</HI> AND WERE NE|VER
IN BONDAGE TO ANY MAN: How SAYEST THOU,
YE SHALL BE MADE FREE? <HI>John</HI> Viii. 3I&mdash;33.</P>
<P>IT is not very material to enquire at pre&s;ent, who
they were who made this reply to our Saviour; whe|ther
the <HI>Believers</HI> before &s;poken of, who &s;eem not to
have owned him upon right grounds, or &startq;whether they
were unbelieving <HI>Jews,</HI> who hypocritically joined

taking &s;ome private opportunity of killing him.<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Vid. Dr. <HI>Clarke's</HI> Paraphra&s;e upon this text,</NOTE>.&endq;
What we are concerned with is the reply it &s;elf.</P>
<P>IF the&s;e <HI>Jews</HI> do not &s;peak here of civil temporal
liberty, and of a freedom from all foreign juri&s;dicti|on,
then we have no concern with them at pre&s;ent;
but if they do (as it is generally &s;uppo&s;ed) they de|&s;erve
<PB N="61" REF="79">
no regard at all: For then, what they here &s;ay
is a downright contradiction of God him&s;elf in the
&s;olemn preamble to the law at Mount <HI>Sinai, I am
the Lord thy God, that brought thee out of the Land of</HI>
Egypt, <HI>out of the hou&s;e of bondage.</HI> There is no rely|ing
upon the word of &s;uch men as the&s;e. Notwith|&s;tanding
they a&s;k, <HI>How &s;ay e&s;t thou, ye &s;hall be made
free?</HI> as if they could be no freer than they were,
they might at that time be downright Slaves. For
they who &s;crupled not to contradict God him&s;elf,
with reference to the time pa&s;t, might well have a&s;&s;u|rance
to deny a &s;ad evident to every man's &s;en&s;e and
rea&s;on at that time. Our Lord indeed does not deny
the truth of what they &s;aid: It was to no purpo&s;e &s;o
to do. But with an unexampled firmne&s;&s;e he pro&s;e|cutes
the &s;ubject he was upon: <HI>Je&s;us an&s;wered them,
verily I &s;ay unto you, who&s;oever committeth Sin is the &s;er|vant
of Sin,</HI> ver. 34.</P>
<P>BUT though the moll: expre&s;s declarations of &s;uch
men can never a&s;&s;ure us of the truth, yet their angry
reply to our Saviour, this fierce di&s;claiming the charge
of &s;ubjection, upon &s;o &s;mall, upon no occa&s;ion at all,
affords more than a pre&s;umption they were not free at
this time. An in&s;inuation of their being in &s;ubjection,
if &s;uch had been given, would have been treated with
contempt, and not an&s;wered with indignation, if they
had had all the power their proud hearts de&s;ired.</P>
<P>6. THERE is another text hitherto omitted, which
&s;ome may think de&s;erves notice. <HI>Then gathered the
chief Prie&s;ts and the Phari&s;ees a councel, and &s;aid, What
do we? for this man doth many miracles. If we let this
man alone, all men will believe on him,</HI> AND THE RO|MANS
SHALL COME, AND TAKE AWAY BOTH OUR
PLACE AND NATION, <HI>John</HI> xi. 47, 48. Some may
apprehend the&s;e words imply, that there was then no
Roman Government e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>I pre&s;ume, there is no nece&s;&s;ity of enquiring at pre|&s;ent
into the views of this Speech. All I &s;hall &s;ay by
way of an&s;wer is, 1. That this Speech &s;uppo&s;es that
<PB N="62" REF="80">
they were then in Subjection to the <HI>Romans;</HI> other|wi&s;e,
<HI>all mens beleiving on Je&s;us</HI> could not have been
any offen&s;e to the <HI>Romans,</HI> or be pretended to be &s;o.</P>
<P>2. The meaning of the&s;e words is, that then the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
would no longer protect them in their religion
and laws, and treat them as &s;ubjects, but &s;end an ar|my
to de&s;troy them, as rebels and enemies.</P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> will illu&s;trate this text. The
<HI>Samaritans</HI> had ob&s;tructed the <HI>Galileans</HI> in their way to
<HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and killed &s;ome of them. The chief men
of <HI>Galilee</HI> complain to <HI>Cumanus</HI> the Procurator, and
demanded Ju&s;tice. He took a bribe from the <HI>Sama|ritans,</HI>
and let the matter pa&s;s. &startq;The <HI>Galileans</HI> then
being exa&s;perated, per&s;waded the Multitude of the
<HI>Jews</HI> to betake them&s;elves to arms and a&s;&s;ert their
liberty. Servitude, they &s;aid, was grievous in it
&s;elf, but to be in&s;ulted under it was altogether in|tolerable
<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE>&endq; <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;aies, that the chief men
of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> dreading the i&s;&s;ue, endeavoured by all
means to appea&s;e the people; and bid them, &s;et be|fore
their &startq;eyes the utter ruine of their country, the
conflagration of their temple, the captivity and
&s;lavery of them&s;elves, their wives and children;
and as they would avoid the&s;e dreadful calamities,

imply a pre&s;ent &s;ubjection: and this &s;tate they
appear evidently to have been in, when that exhor|tation
was given, which I have ju&s;t tran&s;cribed from
<HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI></P>
<P>I have now &s;et before the reader the main pa&s;&s;ages
of this period, concerning the power the <HI>Jews</HI> were
<PB N="63" REF="81">
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in their own country. The &s;um is, They
practi&s;ed their own religious rites, wor&s;hiped at the
Temple and in their Synagogues, followed their own
cu&s;toms, and lived very much according to their own
laws. They had their high prie&s;ts, a Councel or Se|nate,
inflicted le&s;&s;er puni&s;hments; they could appre|hend
men, and bring them before the Council, and if
a guard of &s;oldiers was needful, could be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by
them, upon a&s;king the Governour for them: they could
bind men and keep them in cu&s;tody: The Council
could &s;ummon witne&s;&s;es, take examinations, and when
they had any capital offenders carry them before the
Governour. This Governour u&s;ually paid a regard
to what they offered; and if they brought evidence of
the fact, pronounced &s;entence according to their laws.
But he was the proper judge in all capital cau&s;es, for
when the Council of the <HI>Jews</HI> had had before them a
ca&s;e, which they pretended was of this kind, having
prepared it, they go with it immediately to the Go|vernour,
who re-examines it, and pronounces the
&s;entence</P>
<P>&sect;. VII. THE next <HI>Period</HI> reaches from our Savi|our's
re&s;urrection to the reign of <HI>Herod</HI> mentioned in
the Twelfth <HI>of the Acts of the Apo&s;tles.</HI></P>
<P>I &s;hall &s;et down all the facts mentioned in this in|terval,
which relate to this &s;ubject; after I have ju&s;t
ob&s;erved, that we have here no notice taken of any
Roman Officer or Pre&s;ident in the Country: It does
not follow, there was none all this time, but it was
proper to ob&s;erve it here, though the rea&s;on of this
omi&s;&s;ion do not appear. And this is one rea&s;on why
I have made a di&s;tinct period of this interval.</P>
<P>I. <HI>THE fir&s;t fact is a ca&s;e that followed &s;oon after
the cure wrought by</HI> Peter <HI>and</HI> John <HI>upon the lame
man that lay at the gate of the Temple.</HI>&mdash;And as
they &s;pake unto the people, the prie&s;ts, and the captain of
the temple, and the <HI>Sadducees</HI> came upon them&mdash;and they
laid hands on them, and put them in hold unto the next
day: for it was now even tide, <HI>Acts iv.</HI> 1&mdash;3.&mdash;and it
<PB N="64" REF="82">
came to pa&s;s on the morrow, that their rulers and elders
and &s;cribes, and <HI>Annas</HI> the high prie&s;t, and <HI>Caiaphas</HI>&mdash;were
gathered together at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> And when they had
&s;et them in the mid&s;t, they a&s;ked, by what power, or in
what name have ye done this? Then <HI>Peter</HI> filled with
the Holy Gho&s;t, &s;aid unto them, Ye rulers of the people
and elders of <HI>I&s;rael, [ver.</HI> 5&mdash;10.]&mdash;Be, it known unto
you.&mdash;Peter <HI>having made his defen&s;e</HI>&mdash;When they
had commanded them [<HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI>] to go a&s;ide out
of the councel, they conferred among them &s;elves. <HI>Their
re&s;olution was,</HI>&mdash;That it &s;pread no further among the
people, let us &s;traitly threaten them, that they &s;peak hence
forth to no man in this name&mdash;and having threatened them
they let them go, <HI>ver.</HI> 15&mdash;21.</P>
<P>A council was called; <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John</HI> were appre|hended
by <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> officers, put in pri&s;on, brought be|fore
the Council, examin'd, threatened, di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.
No penalty is inflicted, and what puni&s;hment was
threatened is not &s;aid.</P>
<P>2. THE next ca&s;e is in the following chapter. <HI>Then
the high prie&s;t ro&s;e up, and all they that were with him
(which is the &s;ect of the</HI> Sadducees) <HI>and were filled with
indignation. And laid their hands on the Apo&s;tles, and
put them in the common pri&s;on,</HI> Acts v. 17, 18 The
Apo&s;tles were delivered out of pri&s;on that night by
an Angel, and went to the <HI>temple, early in the morn|ing,
and taught. But the high prie&s;t came, and they
that were with him, and called the council together, and
all the Senate of the children of</HI> I&s;rael, <HI>and &s;ent to the
pri&s;on to have them brought.</HI>&mdash;The officers not find|ing
them in the pri&s;on, returned to the Council, in|forming
them of it. <HI>Now when the high prie&s;t and the
captain of the temple, and the chief prie&s;ts heard the&s;e
things they doubted of them, whereunto they would grow.</HI>
Having received information that the Apo&s;tles were
in the temple, <HI>Then went the Captain with the Officers,
and brought them without violence&mdash;And when they bad
brought them, they &s;et them before the council: and the
high prie&s;t a&s;ked them, &s;aying, did not we &s;traitly com|mand
<PB N="65" REF="83">
you that ye &s;hould not teach in this name?</HI> v. 21&mdash;28.
<HI>Peter</HI> and the re&s;t of the Apo&s;tles made their defen&s;e.
<HI>When they heard that, they were cut to the heart, and
took coun&s;el &s;lay them. Gamaliel</HI> then &s;tood up, and
de&s;ired the Apo&s;tles to be put forth a little &s;pace: and
gave his opinion in the&s;e words; <HI>And now I &s;ay unto you,
refrain from the&s;e men and let them alone.&mdash;And to him
they agreed. And when they had called the Apo&s;tles and
beaten them, they commanded that they &s;hould not &s;peak in
the name of Je&s;us, and let them go,</HI>&mdash;40.</P>
<P>WE have here a fact, or circum&s;tance or two, not
mentioned before. The Apo&s;tles were put into <HI>the
common Pri&s;on</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE>. But we are told in the former in|&s;tance
in this period, [<HI>Acts</HI> iv. 3.] <HI>they laid hands on
them</HI> [Peter <HI>and</HI> John] <HI>and put them in hold</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE>, <HI>unto
the next day.</HI> And in the former period we find, that
our Saviour was <HI>bound</HI> by the High Prie&s;t's Authori|ty.
St. <HI>John</HI> [Ch. xviii. 12.] &s;aies, he was bound as
&s;oon as apprehended; <HI>Then the Band, and the Cap|tain,
and Officers of the</HI> Jews, <HI>took Je&s;us and</HI> BOUND
him. Though St. <HI>Matthew</HI> does not &s;peak of it, till
he comes to relate his being carried from the High
Prie&s;t to <HI>Pilate:</HI> and <HI>when they had bound him, they led
him away, and delivered him to</HI> Pontius Pilate, <HI>Matth.</HI>
xxvii. 2. See <HI>Mark</HI> xv. I.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, there can be no doubt, I think, but
the power of apprehending implies al&s;o the power of
keeping in cu&s;tody. Sometimes a pri&s;oner might be
kept all night in the High Prie&s;t's hou&s;e, as our Savi|our
&s;eems to have been, when they intended to meet
again the next morning. At other times they might
&s;end their pri&s;oners to the common or public pri&s;on,
as in the ca&s;e before us; for it's not at all unlikely,
that they had the free u&s;e of it, and that the place of
confinement was at their own di&s;cretion.</P>
<P><PB N="66" REF="84">
ANOTHER particular here is, that the Apo&s;tles
were <HI>beaten.</HI> We often meet in the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI>
with whipping in the Synagogues: but its likely, this
was a more public beating. And po&s;&s;ibly the Ruler,
and chief men of every Synagogue had the right of
appointing a whipping there: This puni&s;hment now
ordered by the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> its likely, was in &s;me o|pen
market place, whereby the &s;uffers were expo|&s;ed:
and therefore, it's &s;id, <HI>And they departed, from
the pre&s;ence of the council rejoycing that they were counted
worthy to &s;uffer</HI> SHAME <HI>for his name,</HI> Acts v. 41.</P>
<P>THERE is one thing more, we ought to ob&s;erve
here; the Apo&s;tles were beaten, and yet it is &s;aid,
that they agreed to <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> who&s;e advice was, that
they &s;hould refrain from the&s;e men <HI>and let them alone.</HI>
This implies, that they had the power of inflicting,
or procuring at left, a heavier puni&s;hment than that
of <HI>whipping</HI> or <HI>beating.</HI> And it is &s;id, they TOOK
COUNSEL TO SLAY THEM. But I think, this does not
imply, that they could by their own authority put
them to death. Fora&s;much as this is &s;id of their de|&s;ingns
again&s;t Je&s;us; and yet it has appeared, I pre|&s;ume,
that they could not them&s;elves, legally, or ac|cording
to the con&s;titution of things at that time, put
him to death. Thus St. <HI>Matthew</HI> [Ch. xxvi. 3, 4.]
&s;aies, <HI>Then a&s;&s;embled together the chief prie&s;ts and the
&s;cribes and the elders of the people, unto the palace of the
high prie&s;t&mdash;and con&s;ulted that they might take Je&s;us by
&s;ubtilty and kill him:</HI> See <HI>Luke</HI> xxii. 2, 3. And after he
had been apprehended, examined, convicted, and
condemned by them, as far as their authority reach|ed.
&mdash;<HI>When the morning was come, all the chief prie&s;ts
and elders of the people took coun&s;el again&s;t Je&s;us to put
him to death,</HI> Matth. xxvii. I. See Mark xv. 1. As
therefore, the meaning of this phra&s;e in the <HI>Go&s;pels,</HI>
when u&s;ed concerning their proceedings again&s;t our
Saviour, can mean no more, than their re&s;olving to
pro&s;ecute him before the Governour, as a criminal
worthy of death, and con&s;ulting together how they
<PB N="67" REF="85">
might manage the pro&s;ecution, and get him condem|ned
to death; &s;o it's not unlikely, that the phra&s;e ought
to be under&s;tood in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e here: And when
<HI>Gamaliel</HI> advi&s;es them <HI>to refrain from the&s;e men and let
than alone,</HI> for any thing that appears, he mu&s;t be
under&s;tood to di&s;&s;wade them from pur&s;uing their re|&s;entment,
&s;o far as to pro&s;ecute them before the go|vernour,
as men worthy of death; and only to
threaten them afre&s;h; and if they thought fit, order
them to be beaten, as we find they did.</P>
<P>3. THE next affair of this kind, which we meet
with in the <HI>Acts,</HI> is the pro&s;ecution and death of <HI>Ste|phen:</HI>
the occa&s;ion and circum&s;tances of which are re|lated
in this manner.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Stephen</HI> full of faith and power, did great
wonders and miracles among the people. Then there aro&s;e
certain of the Synagogue, which is called the Synagogue of
the Libertines,&mdash;di&s;puting with <HI>Stephen.</HI> And they were
not able to re&s;i&s;t the Wi&s;dom and the Spirit by which he
&s;pake. Then they &s;uborned men, which &s;aid, we have
heard him &s;peak bla&s;phemous words again&s;t Mo&s;es and
again&s;t God. And they &s;tirred up the people, and the el|ders,
and the &s;cribes, and came upon him, and caught
him and brought him to the councel; and &s;et up fal&s;e wit|ne&s;&s;es,
which &s;aid, This man cea&s;eth not to &s;peak bla&s;phe|mous
words again&s;t this holy place and the law. For we
have heard him &s;ay, That this Je&s;us of <HI>Nazareth</HI> &s;hall
de&s;troy this place; and &s;hall change the cu&s;toms which
<HI>Mo&s;es</HI> delivered us. And all that &s;at in the councel, look|ing
&s;tedfa&s;tly on him, &s;aw his face, as it had been the face
of an angel, <HI>Acts vi.</HI> 8&mdash;15. Then &s;aid the high prie&s;t,
are the&s;e things &s;o? <HI>Stephen then made his Speech,</HI> Ch.
vii. I.&mdash;53. Whe$ they heard the&s;e things, they were cut
to the heart, and they gna&s;hed on him with their teeth.
But he being full of the Holy Gho&s;t, looked up &s;tedfa&s;tly
into heaven, and &s;aw the glory of God, and Je&s;us &s;tand|ing
on the right hand of God. Then they cried out with
a loud voice, and &s;topped their ears, and ran upon him
with one accord, and ca&s;t him out of the city, and &s;toned
<PB N="68" REF="86">
him: and the witne&s;&s;es laid down their clothes at a young
man's feet, who&s;e name was <HI>Saul:</HI> And they &s;toned <HI>Ste|phen</HI>
calling upon God, and &s;aying. Lord Je&s;us receive
my Spirit, <HI>ver.</HI> 54&mdash;60. <HI>To which ought to be &s;ub|joined
&s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of</HI> Paul, <HI>in his Speech to the
people at</HI> Jeru&s;salem. And when the blood of thy martyr
<HI>Stephen</HI> was &s;hed, I al&s;o was &s;tanding by, and con&s;enting
to his death, and kept the raiment of them that &s;lew him,
<HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 20.</P>
<P>HERE we have a ca&s;e, in many particulars diffe|rent
from any, we have yet met with. Here is not
only a man brought before the councel, and witne&s;&s;es
heard, but he is put to death, by &s;toning, an ordinary
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> puni&s;hment, without any mention of his being
pro&s;ecuted before a Roman Magi&s;trate. And it
has, in the conclu&s;ion, very much the appearance
of a legal <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Puni&s;hment; for the witne&s;&s;es
&s;eem to have &s;toned him, or thrown the fir&s;t &s;tone
at him.</P>
<P>THE reader will be plea&s;ed now to recollect a pre|vious
propo&s;ition, which was laid down at the begin|ning
of this enquiry; namely, that the &s;acred Hi&s;to|rians
are not accountable for the legality of the facts,
or proceedings, which they relate. Though this af|fair
&s;hould be allowed to have all the forms of a legal
proce&s;&s;e &s;entence and puni&s;hment, according to the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> law and cu&s;toms; yet it does not follow, that
it was rightful, according to the con&s;titution they
were then under. It's certain that Magi&s;trates do
&s;ometimes tran&s;gre&s;s the bounds of their authority,
as well as people commit di&s;orders. We have a plain
in&s;tance of this at <HI>Philippi:</HI> [Acts xv.] where the ma|gi&s;trates commanded <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> to be beaten and
impri&s;oned. But in this their &s;udden pa&s;&s;ion, they
acted very irregularly; as they were &s;oon &s;en&s;ible
them&s;elves. And it is not impo&s;&s;ible, but the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
Council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in compliance with their own
malice, and the clamours of the people, might pro|nounce a Sentence, that exceeded the bounds of their
<PB N="69" REF="87">
authority, and execute it, before the Roman officer
could come in to prevent it.</P>
<P>THIS might be &s;aid, &s;uppo&s;ing there were here
the compleat form of a legal proce&s;&s;e; which I think
there is not. It is true, here were witne&s;&s;es they
bring their charge; but here is no Sentence pronoun|ced
by the councel; not one word of it. Nor does
the High Prie&s;t collect the opinions. If this had been
done, 'tis not likely, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> would have omit|ted
it. In the account of the proceedings again&s;t our
Saviour, [<HI>Matth.</HI> xxvi. 66. <HI>Mark</HI> xiv. 64.] particular
mention is made of the High Prie&s;t's asking the coun|cel
their opinion; <HI>What think ye?</HI> and of the an&s;swer
they made, <HI>He is guilty of death.</HI> And St. <HI>Luke</HI> [Ch.
xxii. 71.] has given the re&s;ult of their debates: <HI>And
they &s;aid, what need we any further witne&s;&s;es? for we
our &s;elves have heard of his own mouth.</HI> In the two
ca&s;es already con&s;idered in this period, St. <HI>Luke</HI> has
informed us, not only of the accu&s;ations again&s;t the
pri&s;oners, and the defen&s;e they made, but of the de|bates
of the Council, after the pri&s;oners had been
heard. The&s;e were ordered to go a&s;ide, there are de|bates,
and the final re&s;olution is taken, and then the
pri&s;oners are called in again, and the Sentence is pro|nounced.
Concerning <HI>Peter</HI> and <HI>John,</HI> &s;ee <HI>Acts</HI> iv.
15&mdash;18. of the Apo&s;tles, Ch. v. 34&mdash;40.</P>
<P>AND in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e, after the witne&s;&s;es, which
they had &s;uborned, had delivered their accu&s;ations;
Then <HI>&s;aid the High Prie&s;t, Are the&s;e things &s;o?</HI> Acts
vii. 1. That is, he gave <HI>Stephen</HI> leave to make his de|fen&s;e.
If after <HI>Stephen</HI> had done, the council had or|dered
him to go out; or if there had been any debates
in the council concerning him, or the High Prie&s;t
had asked their opinion, and a Sentence had been pro|nounced;
it is incredible, the&s;e things &s;hould have
been omitted; as they are entirely. For what St. <HI>Luke</HI>
&s;aies, is, that having heard what <HI>Stephen</HI> &s;aid, <HI>they
gna&s;hed on him with their teeth;</HI> and that <HI>he then looking
up to heaven and &s;aying,</HI>&mdash;<HI>I &s;ee the heavens opened, and
<PB N="70" REF="88">
Je&s;us &s;tanding on the right hand of God, then they cried
out with a loud voice,&mdash;and ran upon him with one ac|cord,
and ca&s;t him out of the City, and &s;toned him.</HI> This
has all the appearance of a tumultuous proceeding of
the people, which the councel, probably, had no in|clination
to check, but were highly plea&s;ed with: For
of them I under&s;tand tho&s;e words, When <HI>they heard
the&s;e things, they were cut to the heart, and they gna&s;hed
on him with their teeth;</HI> words which repre&s;ent an un|governed
rage.</P>
<P>AND if I mi&s;take not, <HI>Stephen</HI> is not convicted
upon the evidence of the witne&s;&s;es but upon his &s;ay|ing,
<HI>I &s;ee the Son of man &s;tanding on the right hand of
God, they ran upon him with one accord.</HI></P>
<P>His expre&s;&s;ions they termed bla&s;phemous; and
in that ca&s;e, the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people at this time &s;eem to
have made no &s;cruple at all of &s;toning a man imme|diately,
without any trial. There are &s;o many in|&s;tances
of this in the Go&s;pels, that it &s;eems needle&s;s to
alledge any in particular. <HI>See</HI> John v. 17. 18. viii.
58, 59. x. 30&mdash;39.</P>
<P>AND, as for the appearance of a legal puni&s;hment
in the&s;e particulars, <HI>that they ca&s;t him out of the City
and &s;toned him; and the witne&s;&s;es laid down their cloths
at a young man's feet, who&s;e name was</HI> Saul; I think,
they cannot prove, that this was not a tumultuous ac|tion:
for even the mo&s;t unruly and di&s;orderly multi|tude
will oftentimes in their utmo&s;t extravagances a&s;|&s;ume
&s;ome formalities of a legal procedure.</P>
<P>NOT WITHSTANDING this, there are &s;ome learn|ed
men, who think, this was not a &s;udden act of the
people, but that it was a puni&s;hment inflicted by the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> councel. They &s;ay that it was not allowed for
a private per&s;on to put any man to death for any crime
again&s;t their Law, unle&s;s they did it whil&s;t the crimi|nal
was in the very act<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Sed uti bene ob&s;ervavit Seldenus, lib. x. de jure nat. &amp; gent. cap. 4. ex zeli judicio, Supplicium capitate in ip&s;o dum committe|batur facinus duntaxat momento, &s;eu homini <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> depre|hen&s;o, a Zelotis, id e&s;t, private zelo ductis infligi permittebatur M.

<P><PB N="71" REF="89">
BUT it may be que&s;tioned, whether the &s;cheme of
Zeloti&s;m at this time was exactly the &s;ame which is
repre&s;ented in the writings, which the&s;e learned men
quote. And though it were, 'tis not impo&s;&s;ible, but
when &s;uch a principle was countenanced, as that of
the right of private per&s;ons to kill men in the <HI>act,</HI>
they might &s;ometimes go beyond the bounds of that
principle. And it is highly probable, that the chief
men of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation, when their authority was
certainly under &s;ome re&s;traints, might connive at the
exorbitances of this zeal. 'Tis certain we have in the
<HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles</HI> many in&s;tances of the <HI>Jews,</HI> in &s;e|veral
places, laying in wait for <HI>Paul</HI>'s life; not to
catch him <HI>in the act</HI> of what they might call bla&s;phe|my,
or any other violation of their law; but to kill
him for facts done by him &s;ome time before. 'Tis not
material to enquire, what this was owing to; whether
it ought to be called <HI>Zeloti&s;m,</HI> or any thing el&s;e. 'Tis
certain the&s;e were common practi&s;es among them.
One thing, which they &s;eem at this time to have
thought the proper object of this private Zeal, is
what they called Bla&s;phemy. Now a criminal could
not well be puni&s;hed for this in the very <HI>Act.</HI> The
words mu&s;t fir&s;t be out of a man's mouth, before he
could be guilty. Here were words &s;poken by <HI>Stephen,</HI>
which they termed bla&s;phemy: <HI>Behold I &s;ee the hea|vens
opened, and the Son of man &s;tanding at the right
hand of God.</HI> The&s;e words were &s;poken before the
councel, and it's likely, before a good many other
per&s;ons, who were pre&s;ent as witne&s;&s;es and pro&s;ecu|tors,
<PB N="72" REF="90">
therefore before <HI>ten</HI> or more per&s;ons. And <HI>Ste|phen</HI>
was put to death with all the expedition po&s;&s;ible,
that is, in the very <HI>act</HI> as near as could be. For it
follows immediately; <HI>Then they cried out with a loud
voice, and &s;topped their eors, and ran upon him with one
accord, and ca&s;t him out of the city and &s;toned him,</HI> Acts
vii. 57, 58.</P>
<P>NOR is the putting <HI>Stephen</HI> to death by <HI>&s;toning</HI> any
proof, that there had been a Sentence pronounced, or
that there was any legal form ob&s;erved in his death.
For this was common in their tumultuous attempts.
Je&s;us having &s;aid &s;ome things which gave them offen&s;e,
<HI>Then the</HI> Jews <HI>took up &s;tones again to &s;tone him,</HI> John
x. 31. He went on to argue with them: They <HI>an|&s;wered
him, &s;aying, for a good work we &s;tone thee not,
but for blo&s;phemy,</HI> ver. 33. See <HI>John</HI> xi. 7, 8. The
&s;toning which <HI>Paul</HI> &s;uffered at <HI>Ly&s;tra</HI> was merely tu|multuous.
&mdash;<HI>And there came thither certain</HI> Jews
<HI>from</HI> Antioch <HI>and</HI> Iconium, <HI>who per&s;uaded the peo|ple</HI>
[<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> the multitude,] <HI>and having &s;toned</HI>
Paul, <HI>drew him out of the city, &s;uppo&s;ing he had been
dead,</HI> Acts xiv. 19. Thus much for the Ca&s;e of
<HI>Stephen.</HI></P>
<P>4. <HI>IT follows,</HI> And <HI>Saul</HI> was con&s;enting to his death.
And at that time there was a great per&s;ecution again&s;t the
church which was at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and they were all &s;cat|tered
abroad throughout the regions of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Sama|ria,</HI>
except the Apo&s;tles, [<HI>Acts</HI> viii. I.]&mdash;As for <HI>Saul,</HI>
he made havock of the church, entering into every hou&s;e,
and haling men and women, committed them to pri&s;on,
[<HI>ver.</HI> 3.]&mdash;And <HI>Saul,</HI> yet breathing out threatnings and
&s;laughter again&s;t the di&s;ciples of the Lord, went unto the
high prie&s;t, and de&s;ired of him letters to <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> to
the Synagogues, that if he found any of this way, whether
they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto
<HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> Acts ix. 1, 2. <HI>When</HI> Ananias, at Dama&s;cus,
<HI>was directed in a vi&s;ion to go to</HI> Saul, he an&s;wered,
Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil
he has done to thy &s;aints at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> And here he has
<PB N="73" REF="91">
authority from the chief prie&s;ts to bind all that call on thy
name, <HI>Ch.</HI> ix. 13, 14.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t, I think, be &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>Saul</HI> could not
have taken up any at <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> (which was &s;ubject to
<HI>Aretas,</HI>) by the authority of the Council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
unle&s;s the Governour there gave him leave: and it is
highly probable, the corre&s;pondence between them
was &s;uch as that he would not refu&s;e it<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Vid. Acts ix. 23, 24. 2 Cor. xi. 32. &amp; Clerici Hi&s;t. Eccle&s;. Ann. xxxi. Num. I.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>AND St.</HI> Paul <HI>&s;aies of him&s;elf, in his &s;peech to the
people of</HI> Jeru&s;alem; I per&s;ecuted this way unto the
death, binding and delivering into pri&s;ons both men and
women, as al&s;o the high prie&s;t doth bear me witne&s;s, and
all the e&s;tate of the elders: from whom al&s;o I received
letters unto the brethren, and went to <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> to
bring them which were there, bound unto <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> for
to be pumi&s;hed. [<HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 4, 5.]&mdash;And &s;aid, Lord,

them that believed on thee: and when the blood of thy
martyr <HI>Stephen</HI> was &s;hed, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> [<HI>ver.</HI> 19, 20.]</P>
<P><HI>IN his &s;peech to King</HI> Agrippa, Paul &s;aies;&mdash;Which
things I al&s;o did in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and many of the &s;aints did
I &s;hut up in pri&s;on, having received authority from the
chief prie&s;ts, and when they were put to death I gave my
voice again&s;t them. And I puni&s;hed them oft in every &s;yna|gogue,
and compelled them to bla&s;pheme; and being ex|ceedingly
mad again&s;t them, I per&s;ecuted them even unto
&s;trange cities. Whereupon as I went to <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> with
authority and commi&s;&s;ion chief prie&s;ts, at mid|day,
O King, I &s;aw in the way a light from heaven, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
Acts xxvi. 9&mdash;13.</P>
<P>HERE is a great variety of particulars, <HI>impri&s;on|ing,
beating in the Synagogue, per&s;ecuting into &s;trange
cities, and putting to death.</HI></P>
<P>As for the per&s;ecuting into &s;trange cities, it is not
at all &s;urprizing, that the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;hould have &s;ufficient
authority and power in their own country, (though
<PB N="74" REF="92">
they had a Roman Governour among&s;t them) to im|po&s;e
hard&s;hips upon the followers of Chri&s;t that would
make them leave <HI>Judea;</HI> &s;ince as has appeared from
in&s;tances in <HI>the Acts of the Apo&s;tles</HI> already alledged,
they were able to drive them from one place, and city
to another in <HI>Greece,</HI> and &s;everal parts of <HI>A&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>THE puni&s;hments inflicted in the Synagogues mu&s;t
be &s;uppo&s;ed inflicted by a mere <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> authority, &s;ince
they had the free exerci&s;e of their religion.</P>
<P>THE Apo&s;tle &s;aies al&s;so expre&s;sly, that <HI>many of the
&s;aints</HI> did he impri&s;on by <HI>authority from the chief prie&s;ts.</HI>
When he &s;ays, he <HI>per&s;ecuted this way unto the death;</HI> I
think, he expre&s;&s;es his aim and de&s;ign; and that in
the oppo&s;ition he had made again&s;t the followers of
Je&s;us, he propo&s;ed to bring upon them not the le&s;&s;er
puni&s;hments only of fines, whipping or impri&s;on|ment,
but death it &s;elf.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e of the lo&s;s of life is that of <HI>Stephen,</HI>
who&s;e death, he &s;aies, he was con&s;enting to, and kept
the <HI>raiment of them that &s;lew him.</HI> Be&s;ide this, in his
&s;peech to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> he &s;aies, <HI>and when they were put to
death, I gave my voice again&s;t them.</HI></P>
<P>HERE it ought to be ob&s;erved, that it is not ex|pre&s;&s;ed
by what authority they <HI>were put to death.</HI> Tho'
the &s;entences were pronounced and executed by the
Roman magi&s;trate, (as in the ca&s;e of our Saviour) <HI>Saul</HI>
might be one who <HI>gave his voice</HI> again&s;t tho&s;e who
were &s;o puni&s;hed; as the people at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> did de|mand
of <HI>Pilate,</HI> that Je&s;us might be crucified. It is
of &s;ome &s;uch act as this, that <HI>Saul's giving his voice
again&s;st them</HI> mu&s;t be under&s;tood; <HI>viz.</HI> of witne&s;&s;ing
again&s;t them, promoting a popular clamour again&s;t
them, or of approving, and con&s;enting to their con|demnation
and puni&s;hment. This is all that can be in|tended,
becau&s;e whether they <HI>were put to death</HI> by the
authority of the <HI>Sanhedrim,</HI> or of a Roman Governour,
it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>Saul</HI> was one of the judges.</P>
<P>BuT I think, it may be very well que&s;tioned, whe|ther
in the&s;e words <HI>Paul</HI> refers to any thing, be&s;ide the
<PB N="75" REF="93">
death of <HI>Stephen.</HI> This is the only per&s;on who&s;e death
he has any where expre&s;ly &s;aid he was concerned in.
There is not any one in&s;tance, be&s;ide the death of
<HI>Stephen,</HI> hinted by St. <HI>Luke:</HI> whereas, if there had
been any, 'tis very improbable, that he &s;hould have
omitted them, &s;ince he has given &s;o particular an ac|count
of that of <HI>Stephen.</HI> It is very common in le&s;s
exact, nay in almo&s;st all kinds of relations, to u&s;e the
plural number, where one only is meant. Thus St.
<HI>Matthew</HI> [Ch. xxvii. 44.] &s;aies, <HI>That the thieves al&s;o
which were crucified with him, ca&s;t the &s;ame in his teeth.</HI>
Whereas, it appears from St. <HI>Luke,</HI> [Ch. xxiii. 39, 40.]
that only <HI>one of the malefactours, which were hanged,
railed on him, whil&s;t</HI> he was rebuked by the other for
it. Again, <HI>Paul &s;aid unto them,</HI> [the keepers of the
pri&s;on at <HI>Philippi] They have beaten us openly uncondem|ned
being</HI> ROMANS, <HI>Acts</HI> xvi. 37. And yet, mo&s;t pro|bably,
<HI>Paul</HI> only was a Roman, and not <HI>Silas.</HI> And
in no ca&s;e could a plural number be put for a &s;igular
more than, properly than here, where the apo&s;tle, in his
great humility, aggravates his former blindne&s;s and
Madne&s;s. And the meaning of his words here is no
more than, when any one was put to death, I was
very forward in approving it.</P>
<P>THUS I think, that all which does evidently ap|pear
to have been done by a proper authority of the
chief Prie&s;ts and Council of the <HI>Jews,</HI> are impri&s;on|ment,
&s;courging in the Synagogue, and in &s;ome pub|lick
place, and harra&s;&s;ing in &s;uch a manner, as to
oblige men to leave <HI>Judea. Stephen</HI> is put to death,
but it &s;eems to have been in a tumultuous manner.</P>
<P>HOWEVER it mu&s;t be allowed, that this was a
time of very heavy &s;ufferings for the followers of
Je&s;us. And one would be apt to &s;uppo&s;e, that for a
good part of this period, the <HI>Jews</HI> had no Roman Go|vernour
re&s;iding among them; or if they had, that he
connived at &s;ome di&s;orders: or el&s;e that their zeal ren|dered
them &s;o tumultuous, that he was not able to
keep things in good order among&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="76" REF="94">
THERE is one thing very ob&s;ervable that for
&s;ome time before the end of this period, the di&s;ciples
of Chri&s;t enjoyed peace in <HI>Judea. Then had the churches
re&s;t throughout all</HI> Judea <HI>and</HI> Galilee <HI>and</HI> Samaria, <HI>Acts</HI>
ix. 31. I hope, we &s;hall be able to perceive, in &s;ome
mea&s;ure, the occa&s;ion of this, when we come to en|quire
what light foreign writers give us into this time.</P>
<P>&sect;. VIII. WE go on now to the <HI>third Period,</HI> which
is <HI>the reign of</HI> Herod <HI>the King.</HI> The account we have
of the tran&s;actions in this period is contained in the
twelfth chapter of <HI>the Acts of the Apo&s;tles;</HI> particular|ly
from <HI>ver.</HI> I. to the 7th, and <HI>ver.</HI> 18, 19. There
being no difficulty in it, I need not tran&s;cribe it. E|very
order and act of <HI>Herod,</HI> here mentioned, <HI>his kill|ing</HI>
James <HI>with the &s;word, impri&s;oning Peter</HI> with in|tent
to bring him forth to the people, <HI>commanding the
keepers to be put to death,</HI> is an undeniable proof of his
&s;overeign authority at this time in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. IX. THE <HI>fourth period</HI> reaches from the reign of
this <HI>Herod</HI> to the conclu&s;ion of the evangelical hi&s;tory.</P>
<P><HI>THE main thing which occurs here is the treatment
of</HI> Paul <HI>in</HI> Judea, <HI>&s;o far as there is any appearance of
a legal procedure. He being come to</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and
having been per&s;waded to purifie him&s;elf with others
that had a vow, entered into the temple</HI> to &s;ignifie the
accompli&s;hment of the daies of purification,&mdash;and when the
&s;even, daies were almo&s;t ended, the <HI>Jews</HI> which were of
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> when they &s;aw him in the temple, &s;tirred up all the
people, and laid hands on him, crying out, Men and bre|thren
help: This is the man that teacheth all men every
where again&s;t the people, and the law, and this place:
And farther, brought <HI>Greeks</HI> al&s;o into the temple, and
has polluted this holy place. (For they had &s;een before
with him in the City, <HI>Trophimus</HI> an <HI>Ephe&s;ian,</HI> whom
they &s;uppo&s;ed that <HI>Paul</HI> had brought into the temple) And
all the city was moved, and the people ran together, and
they took <HI>Paul</HI> and drew him out of the temple: and forth|with
the doors were &s;hut. And as they went about to kill
him, tidings came to the chief captain of the band, that all
<PB N="77" REF="95">
<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> was in an uproar. Who immediately took Sol|diers
and Centurions, and ran down unto them, and
when they &s;aw the chief captain, and the Soldiers, they
left beating of <HI>Paul.</HI> Then the chief captain came near,
and took him, and commanded him to be bound with two
chains, and demanded who he was, and what he had
done.&mdash;And when he could not know the certainty for
the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the, ca&s;tle,
<HI>Acts</HI> xxi. 26&mdash;34.&mdash;<HI>But before he was lead, in with
the chief captain's leave, he made a &s;peech to the peo|ple
in the</HI> Hebrew <HI>tongue: in which he relates at length,
that he had received directions in a trance,</HI>&mdash;&s;aying,
depart, <HI>for</HI> I will &s;end thee far hence unto the <HI>Gentiles.
The</HI> Jews, <HI>not being able to contain them&s;elves any
longer,</HI> lift <HI>up their voices, and &s;aid,</HI> Away with
&s;uch a fellow from the earth: for it is not fit that he
&s;hould live, <HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 22, 23. The chief Captain <HI>then</HI>
commanded that he &s;hould be brought into the ca&s;tle, and
bade that he &s;hould be examined by &s;courging. <HI>But</HI> Paul
<HI>affirming that he was a Roman</HI> [ver. 24.] the <HI>Cen|turion
appointed to attend the torture went and gave
the chief Captain information of it.</HI> On the morrow
becau&s;e he <HI>[the chief captain]</HI> would have known the
certainty, wherefore he was accu&s;ed of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he loo&s;ed
him from his bands, and commanded the chief prie&s;ts and
all their councel to appear, and brought <HI>Paul</HI> down and
&s;et him before them,&mdash;30. <HI>And</HI> Paul earne&s;tly behold|ing
the councel, &s;aid, Men and brethren, I have lived in
all good con&s;cience before God until this day. And the
high prie&s;t <HI>Ananias</HI> commanded them that &s;tood by to
&s;mite him on the mouth. Then &s;aith <HI>Paul</HI> unto him, God
&s;hall &s;mite thee thou whited wall: for &s;itte&s;t thou to judge
me after the law, and commande&s;t me to be &s;mitten contrary
to the law? And they that &s;tood by, &s;aid, Revile&s;t thou
God's high prie&s;t? Then &s;aid <HI>Paul,</HI> I wi&s;t not, brethren,
that he was the high prie&s;t: for it is written, Thou &s;halt
not &s;peak evil of the ruler of thy people, <HI>Acts</HI> xxiii. 1&mdash;5.
<HI>A di&s;&s;en&s;ion ari&s;ing in the councel,</HI> the chief captain,
fearing left <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hould have been pulled in pieces of them,
<PB N="78" REF="96">
commanded the Soldiers to go down, and to take him by
force from among them, and to bring him into the ca&s;tle,
<HI>ver.</HI> 9, 10.</P>
<P>THE chief captain, after this, being informed of
a con&s;piracy again&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> &s;ent him with a guard of
two hundred Soldiers to <HI>Felix</HI> at <HI>Ce&s;erea;</HI> who, when
he had received him, together with a letter from <HI>Ly|&s;ias</HI>
the chief captain; told <HI>Paul</HI> he would <HI>hear him
when his accu&s;ers al&s;o were come,</HI> ver. 35. <HI>After five
daies</HI> Ananias <HI>the High Prie&s;t de&s;cended with the elders
and a certain Orator named</HI> Tertullus, <HI>who informed
the Governour again&s;t</HI> Paul.&mdash;<HI>Felix</HI> having heard both
&s;ides <HI>deferred them, and &s;aid, when</HI> Ly&s;ias <HI>the chief
captain &s;hall come down I will know the uttenno&s;t of your
matter,</HI> Acts xxiv. 1,&mdash;22.&mdash;But <HI>after two years,</HI>
Porcius Fe&s;tus <HI>came into</HI> Felix <HI>room: and</HI> Felix <HI>willing
to &s;hew the</HI> Jews <HI>a plea&s;ure left</HI> Paul <HI>bound,</HI> ver. 27.</P>
<P>NOW when <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> was come into the Province, after
three daies he a&s;cended from <HI>Ce&s;area</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> then
the high prie&s;t, and the chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> informed him
again&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> and be&s;ought him, and de&s;ired favour a|gain&s;t
him, that he would &s;end for him to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> lay|ing
ing in wait in the way to kill him. But <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> an&s;wered,
that <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hould be kept at <HI>Ce&s;area;</HI> and that he him&s;elf
would depart &s;hortly, thither. Let them therefore, &s;aid he,
which among you are able, go down with me, and ac|cu&s;e
this man, if there be any wickedne&s;&s;e in him&mdash;<HI>accor|dingly
&mdash;he went down to</HI> Ce&s;area&mdash;and &s;itting on the
judgment &s;eat&mdash;the <HI>Jews</HI> which came down from <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI>
&mdash;laid many and grievous complaints again&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI>
which they could not prove.&mdash;Paul an&s;wered for him|&s;elf.
&mdash;But <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> willing to do the <HI>Jews</HI> a plea&s;ure, an&s;wered
<HI>Paul</HI> and &s;aid, Wilt thou go up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
and there be judged of the&s;e things before me? <HI>Acts</HI> xxv.
1&mdash;9. <HI>Hereupon</HI> Paul <HI>appealed to</HI> Ce&s;ar, <HI>and was
carried to</HI> Rome.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e is this: A man was like to have been
killed in a popular tumult at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> a Roman
officer there re&s;cues him, takes him into his own
<PB N="79" REF="97">
hands, and lodges him in a ca&s;tle. Afterwards, that
his pri&s;oner might be &s;afer, he removes him to <HI>Ce&s;a|rea,</HI>
the re&s;idence of the Governour, before whom
there are divers hearings. There was therefore at this
time a Roman Governour in <HI>Judea,</HI> at fir&s;t <HI>Felix,</HI>
who was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Fe&s;tus.</HI> But be&s;ide them here
is al&s;o a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> councel, which appears not void of
authority.</P>
<P>THIS is the &s;um of the &s;tory. But here are di|vers
particulars to be reviewed. The preten&s;e for
&s;ei&s;ing this man at fir&s;t is extremely complicated.
<HI>That he taught men every where again&s;t the people, and
the law, and this place, and had brought</HI> Greeks <HI>into the
temple and polluted this holy place.</HI> The whole charge
however &s;eems to have been of a religious nature.
This appears from divers te&s;timonies.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Paul</HI> was brought before the council at
<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> by <HI>Ly&s;ias,</HI> he <HI>&s;aid, I am</HI> a phari&s;ee, <HI>the &s;on
of a</HI> phari&s;ee: <HI>of the hope and re&s;urrection of the dead
am</HI> I <HI>called in que&s;tion,</HI> Acts xxiii. 6. This is a pre|&s;umption,
the debates then ran upon matters of reli|gion.
<HI>Ly&s;ias,</HI> in the letter he &s;ent with <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Felix,</HI>
&s;ays:&mdash;<HI>I brought him forth into their councel, whom I
perceived to be accu&s;ed of que&s;tions of their law,</HI> v. 28, 29.
<HI>Tertullus,</HI> whom <HI>Ananias</HI> took along with him to <HI>Ce&s;a|rea,</HI>
tells <HI>Felix: We have found this man a pe&s;tilent fel|low,
and a mover of &s;edition among all the</HI> Jews <HI>through|out
the world, and a ringleader of the &s;ect of the</HI> Naza|renes,
<HI>who al&s;o hath gone about to profane the temple,</HI>
Ch. xxiv. 5, 6. Here are hard words, and &s;ome grie|vous
charges thrown in to encrea&s;e the account; and
nothing true, but that <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>Nazarene,</HI> as <HI>Paul</HI>
affirms, and &s;eems to make out to <HI>Felix. And they
neither found me in the temple di&s;puting with any man,
neither rai&s;ing up the people, neither in the Synagogue,
nor in the city: neither can they prove the things whereof
they accu&s;e me. But this I confe&s;&s;e to thee, that after the
way which they call here&s;y, &s;o wor&s;hip I the God of my
fathers,</HI> ver. 12&mdash;14. <HI>And after certain daies, when</HI>
<PB N="80" REF="98">
Felix <HI>came with his wife</HI> Dru&s;illa, <HI>he &s;ent for</HI> Paul,
<HI>and heard him concerning the faith in Chri&s;t,</HI>&mdash;24,
The&s;e new notions therefore of <HI>Paul</HI> were the great
&s;ubject of enquiry, to' &s;ee whether there was any thing
dangerous or puni&s;hable in them.</P>
<P>THUS, before <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> at <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI> the <HI>Jews,</HI> which
were come down from <HI>Jeru&s;alem, laid many and grie|vous
complaints again&s;t</HI> Paul <HI>which they could not prove,</HI>
Acts xxv. 7. When <HI>Agrippa</HI> came to &s;alute <HI>Fe&s;tus,
Fe&s;tus</HI> declared <HI>Paul's cau&s;e unto the king,</HI> and tells
him; <HI>Again&s;t whom, when the accu&s;ers flood up, they
brought none accu&s;ation of &s;uch things as I &s;uppo&s;ed; but
had certain que&s;tions again&s;t him of their own Super&s;ti|tion,
and of one Je&s;us which was dead, whom</HI> Paul <HI>af|firmed
to be alive,</HI>&mdash;20. They might mix other mat|ters
in their complaints, as men intent upon a point
are wont to do; but <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> perceived no truth in
their charges, but what concerned their <HI>Super&s;tition,</HI>
or religion. <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> afterwards brings forth <HI>Paul</HI> to
<HI>Agrippa:</HI> and <HI>Paul</HI> having rehear&s;ed the manner of
his life from fir&s;t to la&s;t, before, and &s;ince his conver|&s;ion
and having acquainted them in particular with
his commi&s;&s;ion from Chri&s;t to preach the go&s;pel; af|ter
all was over, <HI>Agrippa</HI> &s;aid unto <HI>Fe&s;tus, This man
might have been &s;et at liberty, if he had not appealed unto
Ce&s;ar,</HI> Acts xxvi. 15&mdash;30. Which words &s;hew, <HI>A|grippa</HI>
was convinced by what <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid, <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> that
the&s;e principles of his were his only crime; and <HI>&s;econd|ly,</HI>
that notwith&s;tanding the charges and preten&s;es of
the <HI>Jews, Fe&s;tus</HI> had a right to &s;et <HI>Paul</HI> at liberty.</P>
<P>FROM all which particulars it appears, that all
the evidence again&s;t <HI>Paul</HI> was of facts that concerned
the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> religion, or the &s;ecurity of their wor&s;hip;
and yet we find, that <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Feftus</HI> were the judges
of this pri&s;oner, in this cau&s;e: all parties acknow|ledge
it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> &s;eem to have owned it by their conduct:
for <HI>Ananias</HI> went down to <HI>Ce&s;area</HI> with <HI>Tertullus,</HI> and
accu&s;ed <HI>Paul</HI> there before <HI>Felix.</HI> And when <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI>
<PB N="81" REF="99">
came into the province, they went to <HI>Ce&s;area</HI> again,
and pleaded again&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> Acts xxv. 6, 7. <HI>Fe&s;tus,</HI>
&s;peaking of Paul to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> &s;ays, about whom <HI>when
I mas at</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>the chief prie&s;ts and the elders of the</HI>
Jews <HI>informed me, de&s;iring to have judgment again&s;t him,</HI>
ver. 15. And again, <HI>Ye &s;ee this man, about whom all
the multitude of the</HI> Jews <HI>have dealt with me, both at</HI>
Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and al&s;o here, crying, that he ought not to
live any longer,</HI> ver. 24.</P>
<P><HI>PAUL</HI> plainly acknowledges them to be &s;o.
<HI>Then</HI> Paul, <HI>after that the Governour had beckned to him,
to &s;peak, an&s;wered for him&s;elf: Fora&s;much as I know
that thou ha&s;t been of many years a judge unto this na|tion,
I do the more chearfully an&s;wer for my &s;elf,</HI> Ch.
xxiv. 10 And that his cau&s;e belonged to the Roman
juri&s;diction, he declared farther by his appeal at la&s;t
to <HI>Ce&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THESE Governours evidently claim the right of
judgment. When</HI> Paul <HI>was fir&s;t delivered to</HI> Felix <HI>at</HI>
Ce&s;area, Felix <HI>&s;aid to him,</HI> I will hear thee when thine
accu&s;ers al&s;o are come, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxiii. 35. <HI>And after he had
heard the accu&s;ers and</HI> Paul <HI>the pri&s;oner in judgment,</HI>
he deferred them, and &s;aid, When <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> the chief cap|tain
&s;hall come down, I will know the uttermo&s;t of your
matter, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxiv. 22. <HI>When</HI> Fe&s;tus <HI>went fir&s;t to</HI> Jeru|&s;alem,
<HI>after he came into the province,</HI> the high prie&s;t
and chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> de&s;ired favour again&s;t him [<HI>Paul</HI>]
that he would &s;end for him to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> But <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> an|&s;wered,
that <HI>Paul</HI> &s;hould be kept at <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI> and that he
him &s;elf would depart &s;hortly thither. Let them therefore,
&s;aid he, which among you are able, go down with me,
and accu&s;e this man, if there be any wickedne&s;&s;e in him,
<HI>Ch.</HI> xxv. 2, 5. Paul <HI>having pleaded there before him,</HI>
Fe&s;tus willing to do the <HI>Jews</HI> a plea&s;ure, an&s;wered <HI>Paul,</HI>
and &s;aid, wilt thou go up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and there be
judged of the&s;e things <HI>BEFORE ME?</HI>&mdash;9.</P>
<P>IT ought to be ob&s;erved likewi&s;e, that the <HI>Jews</HI> are
all along &s;tiled. <HI>accu&s;ers</HI> only: the places are too many
<PB N="82" REF="100">
to be in&s;tanced in, and the reader cannot but reco|lect
divers of them.</P>
<P>&sect;. X. BUT though this affair, thus &s;tated, favours
much the Suppo&s;ition, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had not now the
power of life and death; yet there are &s;ome difficul|ties
that de&s;erve con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>I. IT may be thought, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had at this
time the power of life and death, according to the
con&s;titution they were then under, but that <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> had
acted irregularly in taking <HI>Paul</HI> out of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> hands,
and that the Governours likewi&s;e acted arbitrarily in
&s;upporting <HI>Ly&s;ias.</HI> This objection is founded upon
what <HI>Tertullus</HI> &s;ays to <HI>Felix</HI> in his pleading before him:
<HI>For we have found this man a pe&s;tilent fellow, and a
ringleader of the &s;ect of the</HI> Nazarenes, <HI>who al&s;o has gone
about to profane the temple: whom we took, and would
have judged according to our law. But the chief captain</HI>
Ly&s;ias <HI>came upon us, and with great violence took him out
of our hands,</HI> Acts xxiv. 5&mdash;7.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this: It is not ea&s;y to &s;ay, what we
ought to under&s;tand by the&s;e words, whom <HI>we would
have judged according to our law.</HI> Perhaps he may be
&s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to &s;ay, that <HI>Paul</HI> having, be&s;ide
other crimes, polluted the temple by bringing Hea|then
and uncircumci&s;ed per&s;ons into it, or beyond the
bounds which were pre&s;cribed to &s;uch, we were go|ing
for this la&s;t offen&s;e to put him to death immedi|ately
<HI>Titus</HI> in an expo&s;tulatory &s;peech to the <HI>Jews,</HI>
toward the conclu&s;ion of the Siege of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;ays,
&startq;Did not you erect pillars there at certain di&s;tances,
with in&s;criptions in <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Latin,</HI> forbidding any
to pa&s;s tho&s;e bounds? And did not we give you
leave to kill any man that pa&s;&s;ed them, tho' he
were a Roman<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Jo&s;. de Bell. lib. 6. c. ii. &sect;. 4.</NOTE>?&endq; But though it could be &s;up|po&s;ed,
that here was &s;ome reference to this matter;
yet certainly they had no right by virtue of this per|mi&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="83" REF="101">
to put <HI>Paul</HI> to death. This grant only em|powered
them to kill &s;trangers that pa&s;&s;ed tho&s;e limits:
whereas <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>Jew.</HI> So that they acted irregu|larly
in attempting to kill him upon this account.</P>
<P>BUT po&s;&s;ibly this man here attempted to mi&s;repre|&s;ent
the fact, and pretended, that they were not go|ing
to kill <HI>Paul,</HI> but only to inflict one of tho&s;e le&s;&s;er
puni&s;hments for the breach of their laws, which they
had a right to inflict. And indeed I think, there is
but little regard to be had to what <HI>Tertullus</HI> &s;ays. It
&s;eems plain to me, that he endeavours to impo&s;e upon
the Governour. Their attempt upon <HI>Paul</HI> was a meer
tumult, as appears from St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s hi&s;tory of it, <HI>Acts</HI>
xxi. 27&mdash;31. And if we had not any particular ac|count
of that fir&s;t action of the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> yet
<HI>Paul</HI> confuted, or invalidated all this part of <HI>Tertul|lus's</HI>
&s;peech by that one ob&s;ervation in his defen&s;e and
reply: <HI>Whereupon certain</HI> Jews <HI>from</HI> A&s;ia <HI>found me pu|rified
in the temple, neither with multitude nor with tu|mult:
who ought to have been here before thee, and ob|ject,
if they had ought again&s;t me,</HI> Chap. xxiv. 18, 19.
The non-appearance of the&s;e per&s;ons is a proof, that
what they had done was not legal, and could not be
ju&s;tified: and doubtle&s;s <HI>Felix</HI> &s;o under&s;tood it.</P>
<P>As for the charge which <HI>Tertullus</HI> brings again&s;t
<HI>Ly&s;ias, that he came upon us, and with great violence
took him out of our hands;</HI> this is undoubtedly of a
piece with what went before. He that could call that
tumultuous attempt upon <HI>Paul</HI>'s life, <HI>judging him ac|cording
to their law,</HI> might &s;ay any thing. <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> &s;u|&s;tains
&s;o excellent a character in every other part of this
narration, that it is not ea&s;y to &s;uppo&s;e, he had acted
irregularly in this action. He paid &s;uch a regard to
the di&s;po&s;ition of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people again&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> as
to bind him with two chains, as &s;oon as he had got
him into his po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Not being able to find the
truth from the different accounts given him, he ordered
<HI>Paul</HI> to be examined by &s;courging. As &s;oon as he
knew that he was a Roman, he de&s;i&s;ted from that me|thod
<PB N="84" REF="102">
of enquiry. That he might know the certainty
he &s;ummoned a council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> brought <HI>Paul</HI>
down to them, and had the goodne&s;&s;e to unbind him
whil&s;t he pleaded. As &s;oon as he was informed of a
clande&s;tine con&s;piracy again&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> he prudently con|trives
to &s;end him under a &s;trong guard to <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI>
where he might be &s;afe. In his letter to <HI>Felix</HI> he gives
a mo&s;t ju&s;t account of the whole affair, and of his
own conduct in particular. <HI>This man was taken of the</HI>
Jews, <HI>and &s;hould have been killed by them: then came I
with an army and re&s;cued him.</HI> And though I pa&s;s by
many advantageous parts of his character, I mu&s;t not
omit his goodne&s;&s;e, or exactne&s;&s;e at le&s;t, in not con|&s;igning
this pri&s;oner to <HI>Felix</HI> without adding, be&s;ide his
innocence, that he was a <HI>Roman.</HI></P>
<P>THESE things are &s;ufficient to a&s;&s;ure us, that <HI>Ly|&s;ias</HI>
had a &s;trict regard to ju&s;tice, and the form of go|vernment
then e&s;tabli&s;hed in <HI>Judea,</HI> and that, in re|&s;cuing
<HI>Paul</HI> from a mob, he had acted nothing but the
part of a faithful and vigilant Commander.</P>
<P>2. FARTHER, tho&s;e words of St. <HI>Paul</HI> may create
&s;ome difficulty, which we have in his an&s;wer to <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI>'s
propo&s;al of his going to be judged at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI>&mdash;
<HI>But if there be none of the&s;e things whereof the&s;e accu&s;e
me, no man may</HI> DELIVER ME <HI>unto them:</HI> Acts XXV. II.
Whereby &s;ome may apprehend, that <HI>Paul</HI> was afraid,
<HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> would give the Cau&s;e out of his own hands; and
permit the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Council to try him for his life.</P>
<P>BUT this cannot be the intention of <HI>Paul.</HI> For
<HI>Fe&s;tus</HI>'s propo&s;al was: <HI>Wilt thou go up to</HI> Jeru&s;alem,
<HI>and there be judged of the&s;e things</HI> BEFORE ME?</P>
<P>NOR &s;econdly, is this the meaning of this phra&s;e,
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> The meaning is, no
man may condemn me to death to plea&s;e the <HI>Jews.
Paul</HI> was afraid, that if he was carried up to <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,
Fe&s;tus</HI> might be induced by the whole weight of
the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people there, to condemn him, though in|nocent.
This is die common meaning of this word in
like ca&s;es; when a judge is induced to depart from
<PB N="85" REF="103">
the merits of a cau&s;e, or from his own judgment, and
to pronounce a &s;entence to gratify other people. It is
u&s;ed in a good, and in a bad &s;en&s;e. It is u&s;ed in a good
&s;en&s;e by <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us,</HI> who &s;ays: <HI>Amulius</HI>

<P>3. STILL &s;ome may have a &s;u&s;picion, that if this
was not a cau&s;e within the juri&s;diction of the <HI>Jews,</HI>
the rea&s;on might be, that the pri&s;oner concerned was
a Roman Citizen: and they may think, &s;uch a &s;u&s;pi|cion
may be founded upon what <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> &s;ays in his letter
to <HI>Felix: This man was taken of the</HI> Jews, <HI>and &s;hould
<PB N="86" REF="104">

not with what goes before them, but with what fol|lows,
and tran&s;late them thus: Having under&s;tood
that he was a Roman Citizen, and being de&s;irous to
know the cau&s;e wherefore they accu&s;ed him, I brought
him forth to the Council<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ayant apris qu'il e&s;t citoyen Romain, &amp; voulant &s;avoir quel &eacute;toit le crime, dont ils l' accu&s;oient, je l' avois men&eacute; devant leur Sanhedrim. Nouv: Te&s;tament traduit par Mr. <HI>Le Clerc.</HI></NOTE> But the original will

I think, that the $ following <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> and not <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Mr. <HI>Le Clerc</HI>'s interpretaion is not ju&s;t.</NOTE></P>
<P>I an&s;wer therefore, that this cannot be the mean|ing
of <HI>Ly&s;ias,</HI> that having under&s;tood he was a Ro|man,
he then came upon them and re&s;cued him; be|cau&s;e
this was not the fact, as St. <HI>Luke</HI> him&s;elf, who
has given us this letter, relates it. <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> did not
know that <HI>Paul</HI> was a Roman, till after he had put
him into the ca&s;tle, and ordered him to be there exa|mined
by &s;courging, <HI>Acts</HI> xxii. 26, 27. Nor do the
words them&s;elves nece&s;&s;arily imply, that he knew this,
before he had taken him out of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> hands.
They import no more than this, as <HI>Grotius</HI> has ob&s;er|ved:
then came I with an army and re&s;cued him, and
I have under&s;tood that he is a Roman<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Aori&s;tus hie nullum certum tempus de&s;ignat: &amp; tantrum valet quantum <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> (&amp; cognoveram) Grot, in loc.</NOTE></P>
<P>AND it appears to me very ob&s;ervable, that in the
cour&s;e of this long affair in <HI>Judea</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI> has never
in&s;i&s;ted upon the privilege of a citizen, but in that one
ca&s;e, of the chief captain's ordering him to be exa|mined
by &s;courging.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, if any are inclined to &s;u&s;pect that
<HI>Paul</HI>'s being a Roman Citizen might exempt him
<PB N="87" REF="105">
from the juri&s;diction of the <HI>Jews,</HI> then this particular
ca&s;e mu&s;t be &s;et a&s;ide; and we have in it no proof,
one way or other, what was the power of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
councel over their own people in their own country.</P>
<P>BUT though we &s;et a&s;ide all the proceedings rela|ting
to <HI>Paul;</HI> after he was known to be a Roman Ci|tizen;
yet it &s;eems to me, that we have &s;ome particu|lars
mentioned in this narration, which &s;hew the <HI>Jew|i&s;h</HI>
magi&s;trates had not the &s;upreme government in <HI>Ju|dea,</HI>
no not in religious matters.</P>
<P>THE re&s;cue of <HI>Paul</HI> by <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> is one part of this
Story. The <HI>Jews</HI> were about to kill him. <HI>The chief
captain hearing of the uproar immediately took Soldiers
and Centurions, and ran down to them.&mdash;Then the chief
captain came near and took him.</HI> He did not then know
who, or what <HI>Paul</HI> was: he might have been a mere
<HI>Jew,</HI> for ought he knew, <HI>Acts</HI> xxi. 31&mdash;38.</P>
<P>AND I think that <HI>Paul</HI>'s defen&s;e before <HI>Felix,</HI> in
an&s;wer to <HI>Tertullus,</HI> is remarkable: <HI>Fora&s;much as I
know, that thou ha&s;t been of many years a judge unto this
nation, I do the more chearfully an&s;wer for my&s;elf,</HI> Acts
xxiv. 10. This argument had been ridiculous, if &s;uch
ca&s;es as the&s;e had never come before <HI>Felix,</HI> and did
not belong to him. All the particulars in&s;i&s;ted on from
<HI>ver.</HI> 11. to 21. have &s;ome regard to religion and the
&s;ecurity of it. <HI>They neither found me in the temple di&s;pu|ting
with any man.&mdash;Felix</HI> was a Judge unto this nation
in the&s;e cau&s;es. Nor does <HI>Paul</HI> &s;peak of him&s;elf as a
<HI>Roman,</HI> but as a <HI>Jew. Now after many years I came
to bring alms to my nation, and offerings,</HI> ver. 17.</P>
<P>AND if all this do not amount to a proof, that
cau&s;es of a religious nature belonged to the Roman ju|ri&s;diction;
yet certainly, here is &s;ufficient to prove
that the Romans had &s;upreme power over the <HI>Jews</HI> in
civil matters: or el&s;e, they had no power at all. For
I pre&s;ume, no man will &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI>
were &s;ent to govern <HI>Romans</HI> and <HI>Greeks</HI> only in <HI>Judea.</HI>
I need not remind the reader of all the particulars that
have already pa&s;&s;ed before us. But he cannot forget the
<PB N="88" REF="106">
acknowledgment St. <HI>Paul</HI> makes of <HI>Felix</HI> being <HI>judge
unto that nation,</HI> nor the Roman Garri&s;on at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
nor the title of <HI>Governour</HI> given to <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Fe&s;tus,</HI>
nor what <HI>Tertullus</HI> &s;ays: <HI>Seeing that by thee we enjoy
great quietne&s;&s;e, and that very worthy deeds are done un|to
this nation by thy providence, we accept it always, mo&s;t
noble</HI> Felix, <HI>with all thankfulne&s;&s;e,</HI> Ch. xxiv. 23. And
of <HI>Ly&s;ias,</HI> an officer plainly interior to <HI>Felix,</HI> it is &s;aid,
that, <HI>becau&s;e he would have known the certainty, where|fore
he</HI> [Paul] <HI>was</HI> ACCUSED OF THE JEWS, HE COM|MANDED
THE CHIEF PRIESTS AND ALL THEIR COUN|SEL
TO APPEAR, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxii. 30.</P>
<P>THIS is what we can collect from the &s;acred wri|ters,
concerning <HI>the &s;tate of Judea,</HI> at the time of
their hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>&sect;. XI. I proceed now to &s;hew their agreement with
other ancient writers. The fir&s;t and la&s;t periods are
evidently of the &s;ame kind: and therefore I &s;hall en|deavour
jointly to confirm what we have met with
concerning them.</P>
<P>DURING the whole fir&s;t period, <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> was
Governour of <HI>Judea:</HI> And all we have taken notice
of in the fourth, or la&s;t period, happened under <HI>Felix,</HI>
or <HI>Porcius Fe&s;tus,</HI> likewi&s;e Roman Governours of <HI>Ju|dea.</HI>
That <HI>Judea</HI> was, at the times the Evangeli&s;ts
&s;peak of, under the government of the&s;e Roman offi|cers,
has been &s;hewn already, or will be &s;hewn in o|ther
parts of this work. This being taken for grant|ed,
we are now only to enquire, whether the Evange|li&s;ts
appear to have had a ju&s;t idea of the power, which
the&s;e Governours had in this country.</P>
<P>IN order to determine this, I &s;hall</P>

may however be farther illu&s;trated from two or three
other pa&s;&s;ages. When <HI>Herod</HI> the Great was dead, the

That they might be governed by Roman officers ac|cording
to their own laws.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Jo&s;epbus</HI> &s;ays, that after the death of <HI>Herod

<P>IT is likewise worth while to place here a part of
the Speech, which <HI>Agrippa the Younger</HI> made to the
people at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to di&s;&s;wade them from entering
into war with the Romans. &startq;I know very well, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> that many make loud complaints of the oppre&s;|&s;ions

prai&s;es of Liberty. Before I come therefore to
con&s;ider the pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;&s;e in this your de|&s;ign,
by &s;hewing you what is your &s;trength, and
<PB N="97" REF="115">
what is theirs with whom you are about to contend;
I would fir&s;t di&s;tingui&s;h the preten&s;es, which are
&s;trangely connected by &s;ome. For if you would re|venge
tho&s;e who do you wrong, why do you talk of
liberty? But if you judge &s;ervitude intolerable, com|plaints
of the Governours are &s;uperfluous. For tho'
they be ever &s;o ju&s;t and moderate in their govern|ment,
the &s;candal of &s;ubjection (or &s;ervitude) re|mains
<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">De B. J. lib. 2. cap. 16. &sect;. 4.</NOTE>.&endq; This is a proof, that whil&s;t they had a
Roman Governour in their country, no &s;ober men
among them would pretend they were a free people.</P>
<P>AND it is a kind of pre&s;umption, that the <HI>Jews</HI>
had not at this time the power of life and death, in
that, in all <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s hi&s;tory of the&s;e times, when cri|minals
abounded in <HI>Judea,</HI> and many were put to
death by the Roman Governours; we find not the
mention of any one put to death by the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> coun|cil
or magi&s;tracy, except tho&s;e which were &s;toned in
a vacancy between the death of <HI>Fe&s;tus,</HI> (which hap|pened
in the province) and the arrival of <HI>Albinus</HI> his
Succe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e is remarkable, and &s;ome readers may be
willing to &s;ee it here. &startq;<HI>Ananus</HI> the younger, who
we &s;aid ju&s;t now had been put into the prie&s;thood,
was fierce and haughty in his behaviour, and ex|tremely
re&s;olute and daring: And moreover was
of the &s;ect of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> who are, above all
other <HI>Jews,</HI> cruel in their judicial &s;entences. This
then being the temper of <HI>Ananus,</HI> he thinking he
had a fit opportunity, becau&s;e <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> was dead,
and <HI>Albinus</HI> was yet upon the road, calls a council:
and bringing before them <HI>James,</HI> the brother of
him who is called Chri&s;t, and &s;ome others, he ac|cu&s;ed
<PB N="98" REF="116">
cu&s;ed them as tran&s;gre&s;&s;ors of the laws, and had
them &s;toned to death<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Antiq. 20. cap. 8. &sect;. I.</NOTE>.&endq; <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, many
were offended at this proceeding. &startq;And &s;ome went
away to meet <HI>Albinus</HI> who was coming from <HI>Alexan|dria,</HI>
and put<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. ibid.</NOTE> him in mind that <HI>Ananus</HI> had no
right to call a council without his leave. <HI>Albinus</HI>
approving of what they &s;aid, wrote a very angry
letter to <HI>Ananus</HI> threatening to puni&s;h him for what
he had done. And king <HI>Agrippa</HI> took away from
him the prie&s;thood, after he had enjoyed it three
months, and put in <HI>Je&s;us</HI> the Son of <HI>Damnaeus.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>SOME learned men have &s;u&s;pected tho&s;e words, <HI>the
brother of him who is called Chri&s;t,</HI> to be an interpola|tion.
But we have no occa&s;ion at pre&s;ent to concern
our&s;elves with that. It is certain, here were &s;ome men
put to death by the procurement of the High Prie&s;t
and the council he &s;ummoned; and the action was
judged illegal by many at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> by <HI>Albinus</HI> the
Procurator, and by <HI>Agrippa,</HI> who had then the go|vernment
of the temple, and the right of nominating
the High Prie&s;ts. Nay, <HI>Ananus</HI> had not the right of
&s;ummoning the Council without <HI>Albinus</HI>'s leave. And
I think, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s introduction to this &s;tory is a
proof, that the Council had not the power of life and
death under a Roman Procurator. <HI>Ananus</HI> was of the
&s;ect of the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> who were cruel in their &s;entences
above all other <HI>Jews. Ananus</HI> was of the &s;ame temper.
<HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> being dead, and <HI>Albinus</HI> yet upon the road, <HI>Ana|nus</HI>
thought he had a fit opportunity to gratify his cruel
<PB N="99" REF="117">
di&s;po&s;ition, and calls a council in order to have &s;ome
men &s;toned to death. It is herein implied, that even
this <HI>fierce</HI> and <HI>daring</HI> High Prie&s;t could not have grati|fied
his cruelty in this way, if a Procurator had been
in the country. And though he thought lie had had
a <HI>fit opportunity,</HI> what he did then co&s;t him the prie&s;t|hood.</P>
<P>THERE was likewi&s;e a &s;ort of council &s;ummoned
at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> in order to have<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">De B. J. lib. 4. cap. 5. &sect;. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Zecharias</HI> the Son of
<HI>Baruch</HI> condemned to death: but then they had &s;hook
off their &s;ubjection to the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though there appear not any token of this
power of life and death, whil&s;t they were under the
Roman government; yet as &s;oon as they re&s;olve upon
the war, we meet with it very di&s;tinctly. They then
appointed &s;uch and &s;uch to govern <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> others
to command in <HI>Idumea,</HI> others in other places, and <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
the Son of <HI>Matthias,</HI> our hi&s;torian, to command
in the two <HI>Galilees.</HI> When he came into his govern|ment,
he &s;ays: &startq;choo&s;ing &s;eventy of the mo&s;t pru|dent
men of the country, he appointed them to be
rulers of all <HI>Galilee,</HI> and in each city al&s;o, &s;even men
judges of le&s;&s;er matters: and directed that the more
weighty matters, and all capital cau&s;es &s;hould be
brought to him&s;elf and the Seventy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">De Bell. lib. ii. c. 20. &sect;. 5.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>IT may be &s;aid: There is &s;carce any mention made
in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> of the <HI>Jews</HI> inflicting le&s;&s;er puni&s;hments.
To this I an&s;wer, that the&s;e are particulars which rare|ly
occur in large hi&s;tories; the writers judging them
too trifling, for the mo&s;t part, to appear in their
works. I have however given plain evidences from
<HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> of their power of impri&s;oning, and inflict|ing
le&s;&s;er penalties.</P>
<P><PB N="100" REF="118">
IT is likely al&s;o that what <HI>Titus</HI> &s;ays, of the right
of the <HI>Jews</HI> to kill any man, though a Roman, who
entered beyond the limits pre&s;cribed to uncircumci&s;ed
men, may be thought an in&s;tance of their having the
power of life and death.</P>
<P>BUT I apprehend the meaning of <HI>Titus</HI> to be, that
if the <HI>Jews</HI> had found any <HI>Gentile</HI> in the Court of the
<HI>Jews</HI> the <HI>Romans</HI> had permitted them to take &s;uch
an one and kill him immediately. This was a grant
or permi&s;&s;ion with re&s;pect to one particular offen&s;e on|ly.
Nor can there be any con&s;equence drawn from
hence to any other ca&s;es, nor to a right of inflicting
death in the way of a judicial proce&s;&s;e, either upon
<HI>Jews</HI> or <HI>Romans.</HI> It is evident, that upon occa&s;ion of
other violations of things &s;acred, committed by com|mon

<P>IT is al&s;o extremely remarkable, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had

all the provinces of the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> where they
lived. For <HI>Philo</HI> &s;ays: &startq;<HI>Flaccus</HI> apprehending eight

Be&s;ide the&s;e eight and thirty, <HI>Philo</HI> mentions three o|ther
<HI>jewi&s;h</HI> Senators, who were &s;courged by <HI>Flaccus,</HI>
after their hou&s;es had been plundered by the <HI>Egyptian</HI>
rabble; which di&s;grace he aggravates in this manner:
&startq;There are in that city different methods of inflict|ing
this puni&s;hment, according to the quality of

<P>FROM the number of Senators, mentioned in the&s;e

the other <HI>Jews,</HI> their &s;ubjects: but neverthele&s;s the
<HI>Jews</HI> were not exempt from the juri&s;diction of the Ro|man

<P>I mu&s;t however de&s;ire the reader to ob&s;erve here a

of <HI>Judea,</HI> A. D. 6, or 7. <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Sama|ria</HI>
were then made a Roman province, with this par|ticular
circum&s;tance, that they were to be a branch of
the province of <HI>Syria.</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. de Bell. l. ii. c. 8. Antiq. l. xvii. c. ult.</NOTE>. But that this country of

every thing is exceeding clear in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Antiq. l. xviii. c. 2. &sect;. 1, 2.</NOTE>. There is

the year of our Lord 7. to the year 36 or 37. But that

<HI>Pilate</HI> is in the&s;e words: &startq;Then <HI>Vitellius</HI> having &s;ent
<HI>Marcellus</HI> his friend to admini&s;ter the affairs of <HI>Ju|dea,</HI>

<HI>Marcellus</HI> could not have the power of life and death
in <HI>Judea,</HI> becau&s;e he was &s;ent thither by <HI>Vitellius</HI> only;
and no officer under the Emperour could convey this
power to another, as we are a&s;&s;ured by <HI>Ulpian</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">L. vi. pr. ff. de Off. Procon&s;. &amp; Leg. his words are above, p. 90.</NOTE>.
The <HI>Jews</HI> therefore could not have any one in their
country with this power, till one was &s;ent thither with
it from <HI>Italy.</HI> But there was no one &s;ent from <HI>Rome</HI>
to <HI>Judea,</HI> after this, till the beginning of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s
reign. I &s;hall &s;hew hereafter that <HI>Pilate</HI> was removed
by <HI>Vitellius</HI> before the Pa&s;&s;over, A. D. 36. Therefore
for one whole year, the la&s;t of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> there was no

<P>Now let us &s;ee who was &s;ent into <HI>Judea</HI> by <HI>Caligula</HI>

that the Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> &s;hould not be mentioned,
if there was one is unaccountable.</P>
<P>THIS then was the &s;tate of <HI>Judea</HI> in this period.
<HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> was Procurator there till &s;ome time be|fore
the Pa&s;&s;over, A. D. 36. After that, there was
no Procurator in the country; but the <HI>Jews</HI> were im|mediately
under the government, fir&s;t of <HI>Vitellius,</HI> and
then of <HI>Petronius,</HI> Pre&s;idents of <HI>Syria,</HI> till the acce&s;&s;ion

the&s;e Pre&s;idents of <HI>Syria,</HI> called ma&s;ter, or Prefect of
the hor&s;e, but there was no officer con&s;tantly re&s;iding
in <HI>Judea</HI> with power of life and death.</P>
<P>WE are now to ca&s;t our eye upon the tran&s;actions
of this period, related in the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles. Peter</HI>
and <HI>John,</HI> and the other Apo&s;tles were &s;ummoned be|fore
<PB N="111" REF="129">
the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> Council impri&s;oned, threatened, &s;courg|ed,
<HI>Stephen</HI> was &s;toned, and a very &s;evere per&s;ecution
commenced, and was carried on for a con&s;iderable time
again&s;t all the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us in that country, and at
<HI>Dama&s;$us.</HI> This may be thought very extraordinary,
if the <HI>Jews</HI> were (as certainly they were at this time)
under the Roman Government; and if they had not
the power of life and death within them&s;elves.</P>
<P>NOW I would in the fir&s;t place ob&s;erve, that though
the &s;tate of <HI>Judea,</HI> as I have ju&s;t now repre&s;ented it
from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> and <HI>Philo,</HI> did not afford us any con&s;i|derations
which might enable us to account for &s;uch a
behaviour of the <HI>Jews</HI> as &s;eems incon&s;i&s;tent with their
&s;ubjection to the <HI>Romans;</HI> yet it may be fairly &s;uppo&s;ed
from St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s hi&s;tory, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were very rio|tous
and turbulent at this time.</P>
<P>HERE was now in this country a number of men,
who affirmed, that Je&s;us, who had wrought no tem|poral
deliverance for the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> people, was the Chri&s;t;
That He was had been lately condemned and crucifi|ed
by them, was now ri&s;en from the dead, and was a&s;|cended
up to Heaven. They exhorted even the rulers
of the <HI>Jews</HI> and all the people to repentance. They
proved their a&s;&s;ertions, and &s;upported their exhorta|tions
by no other method, but by rea&s;onings from the
Scripture, and by a healing power exerted on many
mi&s;erable objects. But however, the prie&s;ts and all
the rulers, were grieved that they taught the people,
and preached through Je&s;us the re&s;urrection of the
dead. And though the&s;e di&s;ciples of Je&s;us made no
tumult, yet they were very firm in their tenets; and
when commanded by the councel <HI>not to &s;peak at all
nor preach in the name of Je&s;us,</HI> they &s;crupled not to
profe&s;s, that it was with them an undoubted maxim
rather to <HI>obey God than them,</HI> and told them, that
they <HI>could not but &s;peak the things which they had &s;een and
heard,</HI> Acts iv. 20. And &s;o they did. Whereupon
we find, they were brought again before the councel:
and <HI>the high prie&s;t a&s;ked them, &s;aying, Did not we &s;traitly
<PB N="112" REF="130">
command you, that you &s;hould not teach in this name?
And behold ye have filled</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>with your doctrine,
and intend to bring this man's blood upon us,</HI> Ch. v. 28.
May not any man be a&s;&s;ured that the high prie&s;t, who
&s;poke the&s;e words, and the council in who&s;e name he
&s;poke, would exert all the authority they were po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ed
of a again&s;t the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us? As rulers in Syna|gogues
beat them there, as members of the council i&s;|&s;ue
out orders for apprehending all of that way, impri|&s;on
them, whip them in publick places; and, if this
was all they could do them&s;elves, have them, after that,
before the Governour; and if he did not fully execute
their rage, by artful in&s;inuations rai&s;e a &s;pirit in their
people, which the mo&s;t vigilant admini&s;tration could
not hinder from breaking out &s;ometimes into riots, and
&s;uch like di&s;orders; by which &s;ome of the followers of
Je&s;us might lo&s;e their lives. No people in the world
are always peaceable and orderly, as they &s;hould be;
and the <HI>Jews</HI> were as likely as any to a&s;&s;ume a power
that was not legal. We have proofs of it in <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI>
&startq;When <HI>Fadus</HI> came Procurator into <HI>Judea,</HI> he found
the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Peraea</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">That is, on the other &s;ide of <HI>Jordan.</HI></NOTE> in a riot fighting with the
<HI>Philadelphians</HI> about the limits of the village <HI>Mias.</HI>
And indeed the people of <HI>Peraea</HI> had taken up
arms without the con&s;ent of their chief men, and
had killed a good number of the <HI>Philadelphians.</HI>
When <HI>Fadus</HI> heard of it, he was very much pro|voked,
that they had taken up arms and not left the
deci&s;ion to him, if they thought the <HI>Philadelphians</HI>
had done them any wrong<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Ant. xx. c. 1. &sect;. 1.</NOTE>.&endq; There is another
in&s;tance of the like kind afterwards. The <HI>Samaritans</HI>
had offered an injury to &s;ome <HI>Jews,</HI> as they were pa&s;|&s;ing
through their country to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> The <HI>Je&s;us</HI>
made reprizals. &startq;Hereupon the chief men of the
<HI>Samaritans</HI> go to <HI>Ummidius Quadratus,</HI> Pre&s;ident of

<HI>Syria,</HI> then at <HI>Tyrus;</HI> and accu&s;e the <HI>Jews</HI> of plun|dering
and burning their towns. Nor were they &s;o
much concerned, they &s;aid, for the injury done to
them, as for the contempt &s;hewed to the <HI>Romans,</HI>
to whom they ought rather to have appealed as
judges, if they had been injured; and not make
incur&s;ions of their own heads, as they had done,
as if they were under no &s;ubjection to the <HI>Romans.</HI>
They therefore came to him for ju&s;tice.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. xx. c. 5. &sect;. 2.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THE riot of the <HI>Jews</HI> beyond <HI>Jordan</HI> &s;eems to have
happened in the interval between the death of <HI>Herod
Agrippa,</HI> and the arrival of <HI>Fadus</HI> in the province.
The incur&s;ions into <HI>Samaria</HI> were made, while <HI>Cuma|nus</HI>
was actually in <HI>Judea.</HI> Indeed <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> endea|vours
to acquit the chief men of <HI>Judea</HI> as to both
the&s;e facts. But the common people &s;eldom take
arms, and make incur&s;ions, without &s;ome encourage|ment
from their &s;uperiors. And if the chief men at
<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> were perfectly innocent as to this la&s;t af|fair,
<HI>Quadratus</HI> the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria</HI> mu&s;t have been
horribly impo&s;ed upon, though he came into the coun|try
on purpo&s;e to examine the ca&s;e upon the &s;pot. For
he beheaded &s;ome <HI>Jews,</HI> and crucified others, and &s;ent
the High Prie&s;t, the captain of the temple, and di|vers

<P>IF then &s;ome of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> proceedings mentioned
in the <HI>Acts,</HI> &s;eem not very &s;uitable to the &s;tate of a
Roman province, it may be fairly taken for granted,
they were illegal or tumulcuous.</P>
<P>BUT &s;econdly, I am apt to think the &s;tate of the
<HI>Jews</HI> at this time, if reflected on, will help us to ac|count
of the&s;e proceedings. If our Saviour was cru|cified
at the Pa&s;&s;over, A. D. 33. then this was the
<PB N="114" REF="132">
eighth pa&s;&s;over of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s admini&s;tration: for he came
into the province before the pa&s;&s;over of the year 26.
But if our Saviour was crucified in the 29th year of
the Chri&s;tian <HI>Aera,</HI> which is the &s;oone&s;t that is &s;uppo|&s;ed
by any, yet that would be the fourth pa&s;&s;over af|ter
<HI>Pilate</HI>'s arrival in that country. Now it was very
common for the pre&s;idents, if they had not behaved
well, to &s;tand in fear of the people of their province;
and they dreaded extremely the &s;ending Complaints to
the Emperour. And in order toward off the&s;e, they
u&s;ually thought it proper to do &s;ome popular things.</P>
<P><HI>PHILO</HI> has given us a remarkable in&s;tance in
<HI>Flaccus,</HI> Prefect OF <HI>Egypt,</HI> about this very time. The
five fir&s;t years of his admini&s;tration, which were the
five la&s;t years of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign, <HI>Flaccus</HI> was a mo&s;t
excellent Governour. But in the 6th year of his pre|&s;ident&s;hip,
which was the fir&s;t of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s reign, he
became quite another man<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Philo in Flac. p. 965, 966.</NOTE>. It is not nece&s;&s;ary to
produce here all the rea&s;ons of this alteration. But
in the life-time of <HI>Tiberius, Flaccus</HI> had been no friend
of <HI>Caligula.</HI> When therefore <HI>Caligula</HI> came to be Em|perour,
and had put to death the young <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and
<HI>Macro,</HI> in whom <HI>Flaccus</HI> had &s;ome intere&s;t, he was
thrown into a terrible fright: his concern was vi&s;ible,
and all the <HI>Egyptians</HI> knew very well the cau&s;e of it:
hereupon they got him entirely into their own hands,
&startq;and of a Governour <HI>Flaccus</HI> became a &s;ubject, and
they of &s;ubjects became pre&s;idents, inventors of
u&s;ele&s;s decrees, directors of all affairs, taking him
in as a mere mute image in a play, for no other rea|&s;on
but becau&s;e he had the name of Governour<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ibid. p. 988. A.&mdash;C.</NOTE>.
<PB N="115" REF="133">
The&s;e men therefore, the <HI>Diony&s;ii,</HI> the <HI>Lampones,</HI>
the <HI>I&s;idores,</HI> all the&s;e con&s;pire together to form a
mo&s;t wicked de&s;ign again&s;t the <HI>Jews:</HI> and coming
to <HI>Flaccus</HI> they tell him; Sir, You have lo&s;t the
young <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and your next hope after him,
your friend <HI>Macro:</HI> you have no expectations of
favour from the Emperour, but rather otherwi&s;e.
We mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily contrive for you &s;ome power|ful
advocate with <HI>Caius</HI> [<HI>Caligula</HI>]. This advocate,
Sir, is the city of <HI>Alexandria,</HI> which has been ever
honoured by the Imperial family, and e&s;pecially by
our pre&s;ent Sovereign: If &s;he may but obtain &s;ome
favour of you, &s;he will undertake your cau&s;e. You
can oblige her by nothing &s;o much as by deliver|ing
up the <HI>Jews</HI> into her hands. Then, he who
ought to have been provoked at &s;o impudent a pro|po&s;al,
and to have reprimanded the authors of it
as incendiaries, and di&s;turbers, of the public peace,
tamely complied with what they de&s;ired.&endq;.</P>
<P>AFTER this, <HI>Flaccus</HI> began to &s;hew a &s;trange ne|glect
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and in all cau&s;es the <HI>Jews</HI> were ca&s;t,
till at length he became their open enemy. The <HI>E|gyptians</HI>
taking encouragement from this behaviour
came by degrees to the rifling of the <HI>Jews</HI> hou&s;es, and
murdered great numbers of them. &startq;And the Pre&s;i|dent
of the country, who, if he had plea&s;ed, could
in one hour have quieted this mad multitude, pre|tended
not to &s;ee, or hear anything<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Id. de Legat. ad Cai. p. 1010. E.</NOTE>.&endq;. The
<PB N="116" REF="134">
<HI>Egyptians,</HI> receiving no rebukes for what they had
done already, proceeded to demoli&s;h the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> ora|tories
at <HI>Alexandria.</HI></P>
<P>THUS matters went in <HI>Egypt.</HI> The people there
had no right, according to the con&s;titution of the
country, to treat the <HI>Jews</HI> as they did; nor did the
Prefect formally convey the power of life and death
to them. But for his own convenience he overlooked
their di&s;orderly proceedings. The Ca&s;e of <HI>Pilate</HI> in
<HI>Judea</HI> &s;eems very much to have re&s;embled that of
<HI>Flaccus</HI> in <HI>Egypt.</HI> That is, they were both apprehen|&s;ive
of the Emperour's di&s;plea&s;ure, though perhaps
the grounds of the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, were different.
<HI>Pilate</HI> had been tyrannical in the very beginning of
his admini&s;tration, and had thereby rendered him&s;elf
di&s;agreeable to the <HI>Jews.</HI> For this rea&s;on he &s;tood in
fear of them. This appears in the pro&s;ecution of
Je&s;us before him. The <HI>Jews</HI> cried out, <HI>If thou let this
man go, thou art not</HI> Ce&s;ar's <HI>friend,</HI> John xix. 12. <HI>Pi|late</HI>
&s;eems to have under&s;tood the meaning of this
Speech. If he had not gratified them in this point,
they might have drawn up a long li&s;t of male-admini|&s;trations
for the Emperour's view.</P>
<P>HIS condemnation of Je&s;us at the importunity of
the <HI>Jews,</HI> contrary to his own judgement and inclina|tion,
declared to them more than once, was a point
gained: and his government mu&s;t have been ever
after much weakened by &s;o mean a conde&s;cen&s;ion.
And that <HI>Pilate</HI>'s influence in the province continued
to decline, is manife&s;t, in that, the people of it pre|vailed
at la&s;t to have him removed, in a very ignomi|nious
manner, by <HI>Vitellius</HI> pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria.</HI> It is
therefore highly probable, that to &s;creen other acts
of inju&s;tice, and to gratifie the chief men at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
he might &s;ign decrees of condemnation again&s;t &s;ome
of the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us; or at le&s;t connive at, or not
re&s;train &s;ome irregular proceedings of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> ma|gi&s;trates,
and the riots of the people. Nor can it be
concluded, that <HI>Pilate</HI> did not act in this manner, be|cau&s;e
<PB N="117" REF="135">
he had not the favour of the people of his pro|vince.
For <HI>Flaccus</HI> did him&s;elf no real &s;ervice by all
his compliances with the <HI>Egyptians,</HI> but was at la&s;t ac|cu&s;ed
by the men who&s;e tool he had been<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Vid. Phil. in Flacc. p. 985, 986.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner then, affairs might be carried
on in <HI>Judea,</HI> during the remainder of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s admini|&s;tration
after the re&s;urrection of our Saviour, till a|bout
the beginning of the year 36.</P>
<P>AND after the removal of <HI>Pilate,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> would,
very probably, take an unu&s;ual licence; they not
having then any Procurator among them, but being
more immediately under the government of the Pre|&s;ident
of <HI>Syria,</HI> who&s;e chief re&s;idence was at <HI>An|tioch.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES, <HI>Vitellius</HI> &s;eems to have been at a yet
greater di&s;tance from them the greate&s;t part of the
year that followed the removal of <HI>Pilate.</HI> This, if I
mi&s;take not, was the &s;ea&s;on of <HI>Vitellius</HI>'s expedition to
<HI>Parthia.</HI> It is true, that <HI>Suetonius</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Namque Artabanus Parthorum Rex, odium &s;emper contem|tumque Tiberii prae &s;e ferens, amicitiam ejus [Caii] ultro petiit venitque ad colloquium legati con&s;ularis: &amp; tran&s;gre&s;&s;us Euphratem, aquilas &amp; &s;igna Romana Cae&s;arumque imagines adoravit, Calig. cap. 14.</NOTE>, and <HI>Dio</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> lib. 59. p. 661.

the la&s;t of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign; and gives &s;o di&s;tinct an
account of this matter, that he cannot but be relied
on. He &s;ays that <HI>Vitellius,</HI> having, whil&s;t in <HI>Syria,</HI>
ordered <HI>Pilate</HI> away for <HI>Rome,</HI> went up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>
to the Pa&s;&s;over, which appears to me very evidently
to be the pa&s;&s;over of the year 36. Having put
<HI>Caiaphas</HI> out of the prie&s;thood, and done divers other
things to the great &s;atisfaction of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he re|turned
to <HI>Antioch. Jo&s;ephus</HI> then &s;ays, that <HI>Vitellius</HI>
<PB N="118" REF="136">
having received orders from <HI>Tiberius</HI> to make an alliance
with <HI>Artabanus,</HI> went to the <HI>Euphrates,</HI> where <HI>Vitelli|us</HI>
and <HI>Artabanus</HI> had a congre&s;&s;e, and a league was
made; that <HI>Artabanus</HI> &s;ent his &s;on ho&s;tage to <HI>Tiberi|us;</HI>
that after the league was made, <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Te|trarch</HI>
of <HI>Galilee,</HI> who was there, entertained the pre|&s;ident
of <HI>Syria,</HI> and the King of <HI>Parthia;</HI> and &s;ent an
expre&s;&s;e to <HI>Rome</HI> with an account of the conclu&s;ion of
this treaty, as did al&s;o <HI>Vitellius. Herod</HI>'s me&s;&s;enger
came fir&s;t to <HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Tiberius</HI> wrote back to <HI>Vitelli|us,</HI>
that this Expre&s;&s;e brought him no news, for he had
heard all before. <HI>Vitellius</HI> thinking <HI>Herod</HI> had done
him a great injury herein, retained a &s;ecret grudge
again&s;t him, till he had an opportunity of being re|venged
in the reign of <HI>Caligula.</HI> At the next Pa&s;&s;o|ver,
A. D. 37. <HI>Vitellius</HI> was again at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> So
that this expedition to the <HI>Euphrates</HI> was made in the
year 36. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> appears perfectly ma&s;ter of this
whole affair; the concerns of <HI>Herod</HI> the <HI>Tetrarch</HI> are
interwoven with it. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was nearer the event
than <HI>Suetonius</HI> or <HI>Dio.</HI> Be&s;ides, <HI>Tacitus</HI> concurs with
him. For he &s;ays, that A. U. 788. which is the year
of our Lord 33, when <HI>C. Ce&s;tius Gallus,</HI> and <HI>M. Ser|vilius
Nonianus</HI> were con&s;uls, <HI>Tiberius</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Et cunctis quae apud Orientem parabantur, L. Vitellium praefecit. Ann. l. 6. c. 32.</NOTE> gave <HI>Vitellius</HI>
the command of all things in the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> He then re|lates
<HI>Vitellius</HI>'s expedition, and what he performed in
it, and concludes his account thus; &startq;And then he
returned with the army into <HI>Syria.</HI> I have here put
together the actions of two Summers<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Exin cum legionibus in Syriam remeavit. Quae duabus ae&s;tatibus ge&s;ta conjunxi, quo reuie&s;ceret animus a dome&s;ticis malis. ibid. c. 37. fin. 38. init.</NOTE>.&endq; I think
it therefore very plain, that according to <HI>Tacitus,</HI> this

<PB N="119" REF="137">
them, or near them. The behaviour of <HI>Ananus,</HI> and
his council, in the interval between the death of <HI>Por|cius
Fe&s;tus,</HI> and the arrival of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or <HI>Albinus,</HI> is
a proof of it. Nor were there any on whom they
were &s;o likely to &s;hew their power, as the followers
of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, &s;uch was the temper of this <HI>Vitellius,</HI>
that it may be fairly &s;uppo&s;ed, the <HI>Jews</HI> enjoyed &s;ome
peculiar indulgences under his admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THERE are divers things recorded of him in <HI>Jo|&s;ephus,</HI>
which may &s;atisfie us there was a very loving
corre&s;pondence between him and the chief men of the
<HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation. At the reque&s;t of the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Sama|ritans</HI>
he removed <HI>Pilate.</HI> The pa&s;&s;over following he
went up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and was magnificently received
by the <HI>Jews.</HI> It was through his hands, that the
<HI>Jews</HI> obtained from <HI>Tiberius</HI> the right of having in
their own keeping the High Prie&s;t's &s;acred Ve&s;tment,
which he wore on their great Solemnities<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. Antiq. l. xviii. c. 5. &sect;. 3.</NOTE>: a privi|lege
they had not enjoyed before, &s;ince the beginning
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign. This favour they received at the
pa&s;&s;over in the year 36.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the next year, when <HI>Vitellius</HI>
was going to march his forces through <HI>Judea,</HI> which
was the &s;horte&s;t way, to attack <HI>Aretas;</HI> at the reque&s;t
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he ordered his troops to take another
rout, that he might not offend them with his idola|trous
en&s;igns; and when he had given the&s;e orders,
he went up him&s;elf to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to wor&s;hip God<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Jo&s;eph. ibid.</NOTE>.
<HI>Vitellius</HI> is not to be blamed for any of the&s;e things,
but they are an argument that the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> people had a
great influence upon him.</P>
<P>AND from the Roman hi&s;torians it appears, that
<HI>Vitellius</HI> was a man of a mo&s;t ob&s;equious di&s;po&s;ition.
For he, who had &s;acrificed to God at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
<PB N="120" REF="138">
when he was out of his province, and returned to
<HI>Rome,</HI> paid divine honours to the Emperour. And
indeed was one of the fir&s;t, that began that idola|trous
wor&s;hip, which <HI>Caligula</HI> was &s;o fond of the latter
part of his reign. <HI>Vitellius</HI> was &s;o exqui&s;ite in this, and
other kinds of flattery, that at length his name became
proverbial to denote an eminent flatterer<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Idem miri in adulando ingenii, primus C.

<P>AND though it &s;hould be &s;till thought notwith|&s;tanding
what I have &s;aid above, that <HI>Marcellus,</HI> and
<HI>Marullus</HI> were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the full powers of a Procu|rator
in <HI>Judea;</HI> yet it mu&s;t be allowed, that <HI>Vitellius</HI>
had a great influence on the affairs of <HI>Judea,</HI> all the
time he was pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria</HI> after the removal of <HI>Pi|l$te,</HI>
becau&s;e all the great concerns of the <HI>Jews</HI> men|tioned
by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> are tran&s;acted by him.</P>
<P>I have not attempted to &s;ettle the date of the parti|cular
facts of this &s;econd period related in the <HI>Acts of
the Apo&s;tles.</HI> Learned men are very much divided
about the year of <HI>Stephen</HI>'s death, which is the mo&s;t
remarkable of all tho&s;e facts. Archbi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her</HI>
places it in the year 33<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ann. p. 617. ed. Lat. Lond. 1650.</NOTE>, Bi&s;hop <HI>Pear&s;on</HI> in the

much harra&s;&s;ed by the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> council from the very
beginning, immediately after the de&s;cent of the Holy
Gho&s;t upon them at <HI>Penteco&s;t;</HI> though about the time
that <HI>Stephen</HI> was &s;toned, a more fierce, and more ge|neral
per&s;ecution came on, [<HI>Acts</HI> viii. 1. xi. 9.] and
continued for &s;ome time. And though it may be dif|ficult
to &s;ettle exactly when it began, and when it
<PB N="121" REF="139">
yet I think it mo&s;t probable, that though it
might be abated in the year 38, it was not over be|fore
the third year of <HI>Caligula</HI>'s reign, that is, the
<HI>thirty ninth</HI> year of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Aera:</HI> In which
year <HI>Vitellius</HI> was recalled from <HI>Syria,</HI> and was &s;uc|ceded
by <HI>Petronius</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vid. Nori&s;. Cenotaph. Pi&s;. Diff. ii. p. 330, 331. Pagi Critic. in Baron. A. D. 39. n. 2.</NOTE>. Nay, po&s;&s;ibly it was not
quite at an end till the year 40.</P>
<P>IF &s;ome few of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> proceedings in this period
&s;eem &s;omewhat extraordinary, I imagine, they may
be accounted for from the particular &s;tate of the af|fairs
in <HI>Judea,</HI> which I have ju&s;t given a view of.
The reader is able to judge of it him&s;elf, and I make
no more reflexions.</P>
<P>WE are now to ob&s;erve the remarkable words of
St. <HI>Luke,</HI> Acts ix. 31. <HI>Then had the churches re&s;t
throughout all</HI> Judea <HI>and</HI> Galilee, <HI>and</HI> Samaria. This
<HI>re&s;t</HI> of the churches will be ea&s;ily accounted for from
the following particulars. Soon after <HI>Caligula</HI>'s acce&s;|&s;ion,
the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Alexandria</HI> &s;uffered very much from
the <HI>Egyptians</HI> in that City (as has been already ob&s;er|ved)
and at length, their oratories there were all de|&s;troyed.
In the third year of <HI>Caligula,</HI> A. D. 39.
<HI>Petronius</HI> was &s;ent into <HI>Syria</HI> with order to &s;et up
the Emperour's Statue in the temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> It
is not improbable, but the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Judea</HI> might be
affected at the condition of their countrymen at <HI>A|lexandria,</HI>
where by this time they were almo&s;t ruin|ed:
But this order from <HI>Caligula</HI> was a thunder|&s;troke.
There is indeed &s;ome doubt whether <HI>Petro|nius</HI>
publi&s;hed this order in the year of our Lord 39, or
40. But when ever it was made known, the <HI>Jews</HI> mu&s;t
have been too much engaged afterwards to mind any
thing el&s;e: as may appear from the accounts <HI>Philo,</HI>
and <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> have given us of this affair.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> &s;ays, &startq;That <HI>Caligula</HI> ordered
<HI>Petronius</HI> to go with an army to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to &s;et
<PB N="122" REF="140">
up his Statues in the temple there; enjoining him,
id the <HI>Jews</HI> oppo&s;ed it, to put to death all that
made any re&s;i&s;tance, and to make all the re&s;t of the
nation Slaves. <HI>Petronius</HI> therefore marched from
<HI>Antioch</HI> into <HI>Judea</HI> with three legions and a large
body of auxiliaries rai&s;ed in <HI>Syria.</HI>&mdash;All were
hereupon filler with con&s;ternation, the army be|ing
come as far as <HI>Ptolemais</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. de Bell. lib. ii. cap. 10. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> The <HI>Jews</HI> then
gathering together went to the plain near <HI>Ptolemais,</HI>
and entreated <HI>Petronius</HI> in the fir&s;t place for their
Lawes, and in the next place for them&s;elves&endq;.
<HI>Petronius</HI> was moved by their entreaties, and leaving
his army and the Statues at <HI>Ptolemais,</HI> went into <HI>Ga|lilee;</HI>
and at <HI>Tiberias</HI> calls together the chief men of
the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> people, and exhorts them to &s;ubmit to the
Emperour's orders. When they could not engage &s;o
to do, he a&s;ked them; &startq;Will ye then fight again&s;t
<HI>Ce&s;ar.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> an&s;wered him, that they offered
up &s;acrifices twice every day for <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> and the Ro|man
People. But that if he would &s;et up the ima|ges,
he ought fir&s;t of all to &s;acrifice the whole
<HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation, and that they were ready to &s;ubmit
them&s;elves with their wives and children to the
&s;laughter<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &sect; 3. 4. vid. &amp; Antiq. lib. 18. cap. 9.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>PHILO</HI> &s;ays, That the tidings of the&s;e orders
having reached <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> them <HI>Jews</HI> &startq;abandoning
their cities, villages, and the open country, all
went to <HI>Petronius</HI> in <HI>Phenicia,</HI> both men and wo|men,
the old, the young, and the middle aged;&mdash;
that they threw them&s;elves down upon the ground
before <HI>Petronius,</HI> with weeping and lamentation;
&mdash;that being ordered by him to ri&s;e up, they ap|proached
him covered with du&s;t, with their hands
behind them, as men condemned to die: and that
then the Senate be&s;poke <HI>Petronius</HI> in this manner:
We come to you, Sir, as you &s;ee, unarmed. We have
<PB N="123" REF="141">
brought with us our wives and children and rela|tions,
and throw our &s;elves down before you, as at
the feet of <HI>Caius,</HI> having left none at home, that
you may &s;ave all, or de&s;troy all<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Philo de legat. ad Cai. p. 1024, 1025.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>PETRONIUS</HI> deferred his journey to <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI>
that the <HI>Jews</HI> might not, out of concern for
&s;uch a violation of their religion, neglect their ga|thering
in their corn, it being then ripe, as <HI>Philo</HI>
&s;ays<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 1028. A.</NOTE>: or lo&s;e the Seeds-time, as <HI>Jo&s;epbus</HI> &s;ays<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. Antiq. xviii. cap, 9. &sect; 4.</NOTE>.
He was the more moved by this con&s;ideration, be|cau&s;e
it was expected, that <HI>Caligula</HI> would be at <HI>A|lexandria</HI>
the next &s;ummer: And he judged it not
proper to do any thing that might hinder a &s;ufficient
plenty for the company that would follow the Empe|rour
from <HI>Italy,</HI> and the concour&s;e of the Princes of
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and other great men in tho&s;e parts. And in
his letter to <HI>Caligula,</HI> he made u&s;e of this, as the ex|cu&s;e
for not immediately executing his orders<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Philo ubi &s;upra.</NOTE>.
The&s;e two writers differ &s;omewhat as to the time,
when the <HI>Jews</HI> waited on <HI>Petronius.</HI> Po&s;&s;ibly they
might be reconciled together even as to this. How|ever,
they agree in repre&s;enting the concern of the
<HI>Jews</HI> as very great and general. And it is very like|ly,
that the per&s;ecution of the Chri&s;tians cea&s;ed now,
and that the <HI>Jews</HI> were fully employed in warding off
this terrible blow from the temple, which was their
glory and confidence.</P>
<P>SOME learned men have a&s;cribed this re&s;t of the
churches to the conver&s;ion of St. <HI>Paul,</HI> who had been
a very zealous Perfecutor. But this is, in my opini|on,
to do St. <HI>Paul</HI> a great deal of wrong, on one
hand, and too much honour, on the other. It ap|pears
to me a great inju&s;tice to a&s;cribe to him all the
&s;ufferings of the Chri&s;tians which en&s;ued upon the
death of <HI>Stephen;</HI> when, after his conver&s;ion, we find
the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>Judea, Dama&s;cus,</HI> and every other place
<PB N="124" REF="142">
were filled with malice and &s;pite again&s;t Chri&s;tianity,
and again&s;t St. <HI>Paul,</HI> and every one el&s;e of that way.
On the other hand, it is doing him at the &s;ame time
too much honour. St. <HI>Paul</HI> was then but a <HI>young
man;</HI> [Acts vii. 58.] and though a forward and ac|tive
in&s;trument, yet he could be no more than an in|&s;trument
in that Perfection. It cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed,
that whil&s;t he was with the High Prie&s;ts and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI>
they were directed and animated by him; and that
when he had le&s;t them, their &s;pirits were &s;o &s;unk, that
they could no longer pur&s;ue their old mea&s;ures. His
own dangers at <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> and <HI>Jeru&s;alam</HI> are a proof
of the contrary.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, according to the &s;eries of St. <HI>Luke's</HI>
Hi&s;tory, though the <HI>great perfection,</HI> [Acts viii. 1. xi.
19.] he &s;peaks of, might be abated &s;ooner; yet it
could not be quite over till &s;everal years after St. <HI>Paul</HI>
conver&s;ion. St. <HI>Luke</HI> fir&s;t mentions St. <HI>Paul's</HI> return
from <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> (which was not till three
years after [<HI>Gal.</HI> i. 18.] his conver&s;ion) and the treat|ment
he met with from the <HI>Grecians: which when the
brethren knew, they brought him down to</HI> Ce&s;area: <HI>and
&s;ent him forth to</HI> Tar&s;us. THEN <HI>had the churches re&s;t
throughout all</HI> Judea, <HI>and</HI> Galilee, <HI>and</HI> Samaria, <HI>and
were edified, and walking in the fear of the Lord, and
in. the comfort of the Holy Gho&s;t, were multiplied, Acts</HI>
ix. 29, 31.</P>
<P>LASTLY, According to the de&s;cription St. <HI>Luke</HI>
gives us of this <HI>re&s;t</HI> of the churches in the words ju&s;t
now tran&s;cribed, it was very exten&s;ive, even all over
<HI>Judea,</HI> and <HI>Galilee,</HI> and <HI>Samaria;</HI> and very com|pleat,
and the churches had no mole&s;tation. So con|&s;iderable
an event mu&s;t have been owing to &s;ome other
con&s;iderable event, with which the whole people of
that country was affected. I had no &s;ooner read the
account which <HI>Philo</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> have given of the
&s;ufferings of the <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Alexandria,</HI> and the immi|nent
danger of ruine which that whole people in <HI>Ju|dea,</HI>
and other places were in, in the reign of <HI>Caligula,</HI>
<PB N="125" REF="143">
but I concluded, that this &s;tate of their affairs brought
on the re&s;t of the Chri&s;tian <HI>churches,</HI> which St. <HI>Luke</HI>
&s;peaks of, and which certainly happened about this
time. Whether I am in the right, or not, others will
judge.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> has not expre&s;sly told us how long this
re&s;t of the churches la&s;ted; but it is likely, that it
reached &s;ome way into <HI>Herod Agrippa's</HI> reign. He was
at <HI>Rome</HI> when <HI>Caligula</HI> was killed, and was very &s;er|viceable
to his Succe&s;&s;or <HI>Claudius,</HI> in &s;ettling matters
between him and the Senate<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. de Bell. lib. ii. c. 11.</NOTE>. But this is certain,
that the great danger the <HI>Jews</HI> were in of utter ruine
in the reign of <HI>Caligula,</HI> and the gracious, as well as
ju&s;t edicts pa&s;&s;ed in their &s;avour by <HI>Claudius,</HI> in the
beginning of his reign, did them but little good. For
St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays, that when <HI>Herod &s;trelched forth his hand
to vex certain of the church, and killed</HI> James <HI>with the</HI>
&s;word, the &s;atisfaction, which they expre&s;&s;ed in the&s;e
cruelties, was an inducement to him <HI>to take Peter al&s;o,</HI>
Acts xii. 1&mdash;3.</P>
<P>&sect;. XIII. THIS brings me to the proceedings of
the third Period, <HI>the reign of Herod.</HI> But I need not
add any thing here to what has been already &s;aid in
the former chapter; where it has been &s;hewn, that
<HI>Herod</HI> had at this time &s;overeign authority in <HI>Judea,</HI>
though he was dependent on the Roman Empe|rour.</P>
<P>I have now given the reader a view of the State of
<HI>Judea,</HI> according to the &s;acred, and other writers,
&s;o far as I propo&s;ed at the beginning of this chap|ter.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t not proceed any farther, till I have owned
my &s;elf much indebted to Mr. <HI>Huber</HI> for his <HI>di&s;&s;erta|tion</HI>
<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Zachariae Huber Di&s;|&s;ertationum Libri tres. Am&s;t. 1721. Di&s;&s;ertatio prima, qua ad&s;eri|tur Judaeorum magi&s;tratus tempore Chri&s;ti Servatoris, non habui&s;&s;e Merum Imperium, &s;ive jus gladii.</NOTE> on this Subject. But by this acknowledg|ment
I have not di&s;charged all my obligations to this
<PB N="126" REF="144">
learned and agreeable writer. I have found him a
good guide vpon other occa&s;ions be&s;ide this.</P>
<P>I am &s;en&s;ible, &s;ome learned men have given a diffe|rent
account of this matter. But it will not be ex|pected,
I &s;hould enter here into controver&s;ies with
any. This article is long enough already. I &s;hall
however make a few remarks upon Dr. <HI>Lightfoot's</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">See his Hebrew and Talmudical Exercitations on <HI>Mat.</HI> xxyi. 3. <HI>John</HI> xviii. 31.</NOTE>
account taken from the <HI>Talmudical</HI> and other <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
writers.</P>
<P>1. THE Doctor<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 248.</NOTE> quotes the&s;e words from the
<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> Talmud. <HI>A Tradition. Forty years before
the Temple was de&s;troyed, judgment in capital cau&s;es was
taken away from I&s;rael.</HI> And the Doctor &s;ays him|&s;elf
<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 611.</NOTE>: &startq;It cannot be denied but that all capital
judgment, or &s;entence upon life, had been taken
from the <HI>Jews,</HI> for above forty years before the
de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as they oftentimes them|&s;elves
confe&s;s.&endq; I think, the natural meaning of
the words of the Tradition is, that the People of the
<HI>Jews</HI> were deprived of the right of inflicting capital
puni&s;hment, by &s;ome &s;uperior power or force. It
does therefore in the main confirm my account. For
&s;ince we know, that <HI>Judea</HI> was a Roman province for
&s;ome con&s;iderable time before the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru|&s;alem;</HI>
it may be rea&s;onably concluded, the Roman
Government had <HI>taken away judgment in capital cau&s;es.</HI>
But this tradition is inaccurate as to the time: for if
the <HI>Jews</HI> had lo&s;t this power for <HI>forty years before the
de&s;truction of the Temple,</HI> then they had it not in the
reign of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> and con&s;equently not after
<HI>Judea</HI> was fir&s;t made a Roman province, A. D. 6,
or 7. which was above &s;ixty years before the ruine of
their City, However, it is plain the ju&s;t mentioned
<HI>Herod</HI> had &s;upreme power in <HI>Judea.</HI> How far he en|tru&s;ted
the Council with judgment in capital cau&s;es,
I do not pretend to determine.</P>
<P><PB N="127" REF="145">
2. BUT yet Doctor <HI>Lightfoot</HI> &s;ays, &startq;The <HI>Romans</HI>
did not take away their power of judging in capital
matters, but they by their own o&s;citancy, &s;upine
and unrea&s;onable lenity lo&s;t it them&s;elves. For &s;o
the <HI>Gemarah</HI> goes on. <HI>Rabh Nachmanbar I&s;aac
&s;aith, Let him not &s;ay that they did not judge judg|ments
of Mulcts, for they did not judge capital judg|ments
neither. And whence comes this? When they
&s;aw that &s;o many murders and homicides multiplied up|on
them, that they could not well judge and call them
to an account, they &s;aid, It is better for us that we
remove from place to place. For how can we other|wi&s;e
not contract a guilt upon our &s;elves?</HI> They
thought them&s;elves obliged to puni&s;h murderers,
whil&s;t they &s;at in the <HI>room Gazith:</HI> for <HI>the place
it&s;elf engaged them to it.</HI> They are the words of
the <HI>Gemari&s;ts.</HI> Upon which the Glo&s;s.&mdash;<HI>They re|moved
therefore from</HI> Gazith, <HI>and &s;ate in the</HI> Ta|berne
<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">W M. Ibid. p.</NOTE>.&endq; I cannot think this a ju&s;t account. If
robbers and murderers were &s;o numerous, that the
Council could not puni&s;h them, yet certainly the
Chri&s;tians were not able for <HI>forty years</HI> together <HI>be|fore
the de&s;truttion of the temple</HI> either by their own
numbers, or by their intere&s;t with the people, to
&s;trike any awe upon the Council. And if they had
a lenity and tenderne&s;&s;e for <HI>I&s;raelitith</HI> Robbers and
Murderers (which I do not deny) yet they had little
or no tenderne&s;&s;e for Chri&s;tians, if there be any truth
in the hi&s;tory of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> or of ancient
Chri&s;tian writers. And yet they did not judge any of
the&s;e capitally. For &s;o the <HI>Tradition,</HI> confirmed like|wi&s;e
(as the Doctor allows) by many <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> writers,
&s;ays; judgment in <HI>capital cau&s;es bad been taken away
from them for forty years before the de&s;truction of the
temple.</HI> Since therefore they did not judge Chri&s;tians
capitally, and &s;ince they could not be re&s;trained from
it by any dread of the Chri&s;tians, nor by lenity toward
<PB N="128" REF="146">
them; it follows, they mu&s;t have been hindered by
&s;ome &s;uperior authority. And what could that be
but the Roman?</P>
<P>3.&startq; THAT we may yet farther confirm our opi|nion,
<HI>&s;ays the Doctor,</HI> that the authority of their
council was not taken away by the <HI>Romans,</HI> we
will produce two Stories, as clear examples of the
thing we a&s;&s;ert. One is this: <HI>R. Lazar,</HI> &s;on of
<HI>R. Sadock</HI> &s;aid, <HI>When I was a little boy, &s;itting on
my father's &s;houlders, I &s;aw the daughter of a prie&s;t
that had played the harlot, compa&s;&s;ed round with
faggotts and burnt. Hiero&s;. Sanhedr. fol.</HI> 24. 2,
The Council no doubt judging and condemning
her, and this after <HI>Judea</HI> had then groaned many
years under the Roman yoke; for that &s;ame <HI>R.
Lazar</HI> &s;aw the de&s;truction of the City.&endq; The o|ther
Story is taken from the &s;ame book, and is told
of one &startq;<HI>Ben Sudta in Lydda. They placed two di&s;ci|pies
of the wi&s;e in ambu&s;h for him, and they brought
him before the council ard &s;toned him.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI>
openly profe&s;&s;e that this was done to him in the
days of <HI>R. Akiba,</HI> long after the de&s;truction of the
City; and yet then, as you &s;ee, the council &s;till
retained its authority in judging of capital cau&s;es.
They might do it for all the <HI>Romans,</HI> if they dar|ed
to do it to the Criminals<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 249.</NOTE>.&endq; I think the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI>
viz. <HI>R. Lazar's</HI> Story proves too much; for it not
only proves that the <HI>Romans</HI> had not taken away this
power from the Council, but that it was not taken
away at all for forty years before the de&s;truction of
the Temple. But this is a contradiction to the <HI>Tradi|tion,</HI>
which the Doctor allowes to be true, and well
&s;upported. If we mu&s;t &s;uppo&s;e the fight, <HI>the little boy</HI>
is &s;aid to have had <HI>&s;itting upon his father's Shoulders,</HI>
be matter of fact, it will be needful to reconcile it with
the <HI>Tradition</HI> abovementioned. This I don't know
how to do any otherwi&s;e, than by &s;upo&s;ing, that the
<PB N="129" REF="147">
<HI>Tradition</HI> repre&s;ents the legal &s;tate of the con&s;titution
they were under, for forty years before the de&s;truction
of the temple; and that the burning of the Prie&s;t's
daughter, if it was don by order of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> coun|cel,
was an irregular and illegal action. The &s;ame
thing ought al&s;o to be &s;uppo&s;ed of the &s;econd &s;tory, if
it be true. But this way of reconciliation would not
&s;uit the Doctor.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, though the Tradition confirms
my account; I cannot but think, that the te&s;timonies
I have alleged relating to this &s;ubject, are preferable to
the te&s;timonies of <HI>Talmudkal,</HI> or other later <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> wri|ters.
All the authors I have quoted mu&s;t be allowed
to have been acquainted with the form of Government
which the <HI>Romans</HI> e&s;tabli&s;hied in their provinces; and
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> mu&s;t have known the &s;tate of <HI>Judea</HI> in parti|cular.
And I hope the reader is convinced, that there
is upon this &s;ubject a perfect agreement between the&s;e
authors and the &s;acred writers of the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI></P>

<P>&sect;. XIV. ST. <HI>John</HI> [Ch. xviii. 3.] &s;ays: <HI>Judas then

<P>FARTHER, when the chief prie&s;ts and Phari&s;ees

&s;aid unto them, Ye have a watch</HI> [<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">] <HI>go your

From whence one would be apt to conclude, that there
was, at le&s;t at the fea&s;t times, a guard of Soldiers
upon duty, from which they might draw out a &s;uffi|cient
number for any particular purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><HI>AS they we about to kill him</HI> [Paul] <HI>Tidings came

<HI>was in an uproar: who immediately took Soldiers

<HI>And as</HI> Paul <HI>was to be led into the Ca&s;tle</HI>&mdash;When

<P>THERE was therefore at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> a Roman offi|cer,
who had the Government of the Ca&s;tle, and a
good body of troops under him.</P>
<P>A pa&s;&s;age or two from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> will confirm and
Illu&s;trate the&s;e particulars. &startq;<HI>Antonia, &s;ays he,</HI> was

high, &s;teep on all &s;ides. It was the work of King
<HI>Herod,</HI> in which he had &s;hewn his u&s;ual magnifi|cence.&mdash;On that &s;ide where it joined to the por|ticoes
of the Temple, there were STAIRS reaching

and po&s;ting them&s;elves in their armour in &s;everal

Fea&s;ts there was a detachment of the&s;e Soldiers, which
came down from the Ca&s;tle, and kept guard in the
porticoes of the temple. It may be que&s;tioned what
was <HI>Ly&s;ias's</HI> po&s;t at <HI>Jeru&s;alem. Grotius</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Praefecto ejus cohortis quae temporibus fe&s;tis, ac proinde etiam in Pentecoile, prae&s;idium habebat in porticibus templi, ad prohiben$ dos tumultus, &s;i qui orirentur, in Act. xxi. 31.</NOTE> &s;uppo&s;ed
that he was captain of a cohort that kept guard at the

not appear to have been Fea&s;t time, when <HI>Paul</HI> was
feized (though <HI>Penteco&s;t</HI> was near, <HI>Acts</HI> xx. 6, 16.) It
<PB N="132" REF="150">
&s;eems plain to me, that <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> was not upon duty at
the temple at this time. They <HI>laid hands upon</HI> Paul&mdash;
<HI>And all the city was moved, and the people ran together:
and they took</HI> Paul, <HI>and drew him out of the temple: and
forthwith the doors were &s;hut. And as they went about
to kill</HI> Paul, <HI>tidings came to the chief captain of the hand,
that all</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>was in an uproar,</HI> Ch. xxi. 30-32.
<HI>Who immediately took Soldiers, and centurions, and ran
down unto them.</HI> If <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> had been in the porticoes of

brought to him; and that not till <HI>all</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>was
in an uproar.</HI> It is ob&s;ervable al&s;o, that <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> after|ward
&s;ummoned the whole council of the <HI>Jews.</HI> The
word<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Phivoninus.</NOTE>, which we render <HI>Band,</HI> is u&s;ed with con&s;i|derable
latitude. The word, we have rendered <HI>chief

and is often u&s;ed particularly for a tribune. I &s;uppo&s;e
therefore, that <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> was the olde&s;t Tribune at <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI>
and that he was the commanding officer at the
ca&s;tle of <HI>Antonia,</HI> and was intru&s;ted by <HI>Felix</HI> with what
power he thought fit to give to the chief officer under
him at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. XV. WE may now proceed to another parti|cular.
St. <HI>John</HI> [Ch. Xviii. 12.] &s;ays: <HI>Then the band
and the</HI> CAPTAIN [<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">] <HI>and officers of the</HI>
Jews <HI>took Je&s;us and bound him.</HI> I am inclined to think,
the <HI>captain</HI> here mentioned was a <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> officer. But I
do not infill upon it. I add therefore two or three o|ther
texts. And as they &s;pake to the people, the prie&s;ts
and the CAPTAIN OF THE TEMPLE [<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">]
<HI>and the Sadducees came upon them,</HI> Acts iv. 1. <HI>Now
when the high prie&s;t, and the</HI> CAPTAIN OF THE TEMPLE,
<HI>and the chief prie&s;ts heard the&s;e things,</HI> v. 24. <HI>then went
the</HI> CAPTAIN <HI>with the officers,</HI> ver. 26. I believe, mo&s;t
per&s;ons will &s;uppo&s;e, that this <HI>captain of the temple</HI> was
a <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> officer. There is in <HI>Jo&s;epbus</HI> &s;uch an officer
mentioned, who is evidently a <HI>Jew.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="151">
WHILST the above-named <HI>Cumanus</HI> was procura|tor
of <HI>Judea,</HI> there happened a dreadful difference be|tween
the <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Samaritans. Cumanus</HI> not being
able to put an end to it, <HI>Ummidius Quadratus</HI> pre&s;ident
of <HI>Syria</HI> came into <HI>Judea,</HI> and puni&s;hed &s;everal <HI>Jews</HI>
and <HI>Samaritans</HI> upon the &s;pot, and &s;ent others to <HI>Rome.</HI>
This la&s;t part of his conduct is thus expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>

<P>WHEN <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> is reckoning up the cau&s;es of
offen&s;e, which the <HI>Jews</HI> gave the <HI>Romans,</HI> he &s;ays:
&startq; And at the Temple <HI>Eleazar,</HI> the Son of <HI>Ananias</HI> the

with the <HI>Romans:</HI> for they rejected the &s;acrifice of
<HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> for them. And tho' the high prie&s;ts and ma|ny
of the chief men entreated them not to omit the
ancient cu&s;tom of &s;acrificing for their governours,
they would not be per&s;waded; relying upon the

being much at the direction of the Captain <HI>Elea|zar.&endq;</HI>

variety of mini&s;trarations at the temple, and a great
number of Pried; and Levites always in waiting, but

officer who pre&s;ided over each divi&s;ion, and that there
was one who had a command above all the re&s;t.</P>

<P>WHEN the war was breaking out in <HI>Judea, Agrippa</HI>

that the two tribes of <HI>Judah,</HI> and <HI>Benjamin</HI> were not
entire in <HI>Judea,</HI> but that many of tho&s;e tribes lived al|&s;o

<P>IN the account of <HI>Ezra's</HI> journey from <HI>Babylon</HI> to

<P>&sect;. III. THERE is frequent mention made, in the
<HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles,</HI> of the <HI>jewi&s;h Synagogues</HI> in the
Heathen countries, and of the wor&s;hip they perform|ed
in them: but there is &s;omewhat particular in the
de&s;cription of the place of wor&s;hip which the <HI>Jews</HI>
had at <HI>Philippi. And on the Sabbath day we went out of
the City by a</HI> RIVER SIDE, <HI>where prayer was wont to be
made,</HI> Acts xvi. 13. There is &s;ome difference among
learned men, whether the original word in this place,
which we have rendered <HI>prayer,</HI> &s;hould be here under|&s;tood
of the <HI>act,</HI> or the <HI>place</HI> of prayer<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>. I am in|clined
to think with Doctor <HI>Whitby, Grotius</HI> and others,
that it is a place of wor&s;hip which is here &s;poken of,
But what I am chiefly concerned to ob&s;erve here, a|greeably
to my de&s;ign, is, that it may be inferred
from this text, that it was not unu&s;ual for the <HI>Jews,</HI>
le&s;t in &s;trange countries, to wor&s;hip or to erect places
of wor&s;hip near a RIVER.</P>
<P>THERE is an in&s;tance of this kind recorded by <HI>Jo|&s;ephus,</HI>
who has given us the Decree of the City of
<HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us</HI> permitting the <HI>Jews</HI> to build oratories;
a part of which Decree runs thus: &startq; We ordain that
the <HI>Jews,</HI> who are willing, men and women, do
<PB N="141" REF="159">
ob&s;erve the Sabbaths, and perform &s;acred rites ac|cording
to the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> laws, and build oratories BY
THE SEA SIDE according to the cu&s;torh of their
country; and if any man, whether magi&s;trate or
private per&s;on, give them any let or di&s;turbance,
he &s;hall pay a fine to the City<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Jo&s;. Ant. lib. 14. c. 10. &sect;. 24.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>AND <HI>Tertullian</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Judaei enim fe&s;ti, Sabbata, &amp; coena pura,&mdash;&amp; jejunia cum azymis, &amp; orationes LITORALES, quae utique aliena &s;unt &agrave; diis ve&s;tris.

by the <HI>Sea-Side,</HI> or <HI>River-Side.</HI></P>
<P>THESE two pa&s;&s;ages are &s;ufficient to per&s;wade us,
that it was common for the <HI>Jews</HI> to wor&s;hip in the&s;e
places. But it may be a que&s;tion, whether this practi&s;e
was owing to their choice, or to &s;ome nece&s;&s;ity laid
upon them by the Heathen Magi&s;trates, to perform
their wor&s;hip without the gates of their cities.</P>
<P>I &s;hall lay together a &s;ew pa&s;&s;ages and remarks re|lating
to this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>IT &s;eems to me that <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed the Shore|prayers
to be properly a <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> cu&s;tom, &s;ince he
reckons them with others that were &s;o. The terms of
the Decree of the people of <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us</HI> imply the
&s;ame thing. And the <HI>Sea &s;ide</HI> does not appear to be
mentioned as a re&s;traint or limitation, but as a grant
of a privilege, e&s;tabli&s;hing the <HI>Oratory</HI> in the place
mo&s;t agreeable to the <HI>Jews. Philo</HI> &s;ays, that when
<HI>Flaccus</HI> the prefect of <HI>Egypt</HI> had been taken into cu&s;to|dy
at <HI>Alexandria</HI> by order of <HI>Caligula,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> of|fered
up thank&s;giving to God, &s;pent the whole night
in hymns and Songs, &startq; and early in the morning
flocking out of the gates of the City they go to the
neighbouring &s;hores, for the [Pro&s;euchae] Orato|ries

<P>IT is true, their oratories at <HI>Alexandria</HI> were then
all down. But yet methinks here are &s;ome &s;igns, that
the <HI>Sea-&s;ide</HI> was a place agreeable to them. Why el&s;e
did they go out of the city &s;o univer&s;ally toward the
neighbouring &s;hores, rather than any other way? Be|&s;ides,
<HI>Philo</HI> expre&s;&s;es much &s;atisfaction in this &s;ituati|on,
when he calls it a <HI>mo&s;t pure place.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is a pa&s;&s;age very appo&s;ite to this text in the
account <HI>Philo</HI> gives of the annual rejoycings, the <HI>Jews</HI>
were wont to make for the Septuagint Tran&s;lation,
&startq; Wherefore, <HI>(&s;ays be)</HI> even to this day, there is kept
every year a fea&s;t and &s;olemnity in the I&s;le of <HI>Pha|ns,</HI>
whither not only the <HI>Jews,</HI> but many others
al&s;o cro&s;s over, to pay a re&s;pect to the place where
this ver&s;ion was fir&s;t &s;een.&mdash;And after prayers and
thank&s;givings, &s;ome rai&s;e tents on the Shore, others
lay them&s;elves down upon the Sea Sand, in the o|pen

<P>THESE pa&s;&s;ages have &s;ometimes inclined me to
think, that the true rendring of this text is thus:
<HI>Where it had been thought fit that the oratory &s;hould be;</HI>
implying the <HI>Jews</HI> choice of that &s;ituation. But if
any think, that the more natural meaning of the
words is, <HI>Where a hov&s;e of prayer was allowed</HI> or ap|pointed
<HI>to be by the law;</HI> yet I believe it ought to be
&s;uppo&s;ed, that this appointment was perfectly agreea|ble
to the <HI>Jews,</HI> if not owing to their own choice.

<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> tells us, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> and his company, in
their way to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> from <HI>Miletus, &s;ailed into</HI> Syria

there &s;even days&mdash;And when we had accompli&s;hed tho&s;e
days, we departed and went our way, and they all brought
us on our way, with wives and children till we were out of
the City: and we kneeled down on</HI> THE SHORE AND
PRAYED, Acts xxi. 3&mdash;5. I &s;hould have concluded
from this very text, that it was then u&s;ual for the
<HI>Jews,</HI> or &s;ome other people to pray by the Sea &s;ide.
It appears from pa&s;&s;ages alleged above, that it was a

<P>SOME have made a que&s;tion, whether there be any
more than one Synagogue here &s;poken of. Others
think the mo&s;t natural meaning of the words imports
2s many Synagogues as there are nations, or &s;orts of

<P>&startq;ABOUT this time, <HI>&s;ays Jo&s;ephus, Helene</HI> the

to all, that <HI>Izates</HI> had his be&s;t affections, as if
he had been an only Son. The re&s;t of the &s;ons there|fore
envied him. The father was &s;en&s;ible of it: &startq;And
therefore, le&s;t any mi&s;chief &s;hould happen, having

<P>SOME time after this, <HI>Monobazus</HI> the father dies:

<P><PB N="148" REF="166">
&startq;BUT whil&s;t <HI>Izates</HI> re&s;ided in the fortre&s;&s;e <HI>Spa&s;i|na</HI>
a <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> merchant, who&s;e name was <HI>Ananias,</HI>
who was wont to have acce&s;&s;e to the women of the
court, [or the <HI>King's wives</HI>] taught them to wor|&s;hip
God according to the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> manner. By their

brought over him likewi&s;e to the &s;ame Sentiments.

<P>WHEN <HI>Izates</HI> was returned and &s;eated upon the

extremely de&s;irous to enter fully into them. And
under&s;tanding, that he could not be a perfect <HI>Jew,</HI>
unle&s;s he was circumci&s;ed, he was di&s;po&s;ed to that
al&s;o<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">.<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ibid. &sect;. 5.</NOTE>.&endq; His mother having had notice of the&s;e

alienate his &s;ubje&s; and provoke them to rebell. She
al&s;o informed <HI>Ananias,</HI> what advice &s;he had given her
Son. <HI>Ananias</HI> was of the &s;ame opinion with her, and
told <HI>Izates,</HI> that if he per&s;i&s;ted in this de&s;ign, he mu&s;t
nece&s;&s;arily leave him; for the people would impute
this action to him, and it would not be &s;afe for him
to &s;tay any longer in the country. He told him more|over;
&startq;<HI>That he might wor&s;hip God without circumci&s;ion,
if he did but fully determine to follow the jewi&s;h in&s;ti|tutions.
For this was more important [or e&s;&s;entail]
than circumci&s;ion</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ibid.</NOTE> And having a&s;&s;ured him that
<PB N="149" REF="167">
<HI>God would forgive him his not doing what he declined
only out of nece&s;&s;ity, and for fear of his &s;ubjects,</HI> the
King for a time &s;ubmitted to what he &s;aid. How|ever
he had not wholly abandoned his de&s;ign. And
&s;ometime after this, another <HI>Jew</HI> named <HI>Eleazar</HI>
coming thither out of <HI>Galilee,</HI> who was reckoned
to be very skilful in the laws, he brought him to
perfect his de&s;ign. For when he came in to wait
upon the King, he found him reading the law of
<HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> And thereupon addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to him in
this manner: <HI>You little think, O King, how great
an injurie you offer to the lawes, and in them to God.
For you ought not only to read the lawes, but in the
fir&s;t place, to do the things which are enjoined by them.
How long do you remain uncircumci&s;ed! If you have
not yet read the Law concerning circumci&s;ion, read it
now, that you may know what impiety you are in.</HI> The
King having heard the&s;e words, deferred the thing
no longer, but going into another chamber, and
having called in a phy&s;ician, performed the com|mandment<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ibid.</NOTE> And then &s;ending for his mother,

done the work. They were immediately &s;ei&s;ed
with an uncommon &s;urpri&s;e and fear, le&s;t, if this
matter came to be public, the King &s;hould be in
danger of lo&s;ing his kingdome.&mdash;But God &s;uf|fered
not tho&s;e things to come to pa&s;&s;e which they
feared. For though <HI>Izates</HI> was in many dangers,
God pre&s;erved him and his &s;ons, and opened a way
for their &s;afety, when they were encompa&s;&s;ed with
difficulties; manife&s;ting<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ibid.</NOTE> thereby that they who

it &s;eems &s;omewhat probable, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> him&s;elf was
on this &s;ide the que&s;tion. <HI>Ananias</HI> di&s;pen&s;ed with it,
only on account of a very great nece&s;&s;ity: <HI>Eleazar</HI> is
repre&s;ented as mo&s;t skilful in the laws: and in the
conclu&s;ion, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> intimates, that <HI>Izates,</HI> by em|bracing

<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De B. J. lib. ii. cap. 8. &sect;. 14. Antiq. 18. c. 1. &sect;. 2. &amp; alibi.</NOTE> has given of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> Sects: and will be evi|dent
from the particulars, which will be taken notice

<P>&startq;THE <HI>Phari&s;ees, Jo&s;ephus &s;ays,</HI> were reckoned
the mo&s;t religious of any of the <HI>Jews,</HI> and to be the

Go&s;pels frequent mention of the traditions of the el|ders.
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, &startq;The <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> have delivered
to the people many in&s;titutions as received from the
fathers, which are not written in the laws of <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. 13. c. 10. &sect;. 6.</NOTE>.&endq; Whereas St. <HI>Mark</HI> &s;ays, <HI>The Phari&s;ees,</HI> and

immediately after the words ju&s;t now cited from him,
&startq;That the <HI>Sadducees</HI> were able to draw over to them
the rich only, the people not following them: for
the multitude was with the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ibid.</NOTE>&endq;.</P>
<P>IN many parts of the Go&s;pels, and e&s;pecially in the
pro&s;ecution of our Saviour before <HI>Pilate,</HI> the common
people appear to have been very much at the devotion
of the <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI> It is evident from what has been al|ready
alledged here from <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> than the people
were u&s;ually on their &s;ide. He has &s;aid the &s;ame thing
in other places. &startq;They had (<HI>&s;ays he</HI>) &s;uch an influ|ence

thing agajn&s;t a King or an High Prie&s;t, they were
credited<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ibid. &sect;. 5.</NOTE>&endq;.</P>
<P>ACCORDING to the Evangeli&s;ts, they affected the
direction of publick affairs; and very much abu&s;ed
the credulity of the people, and the reputation they
had for &s;anctity. They <HI>loved &s;alutations in the market
places, and the</HI> chief <HI>&s;eats in the Synagogues, and the
<PB N="154" REF="172">
uppermo&s;t rooms at fea&s;ts, devoured widows hou&s;es, and
for a pretence made long prayers,</HI> Mat. xxiii. 14. Mark
xii. 38&mdash;40. Luke xx. 46, 47.</P>
<P>AND <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> allows they did &s;ometimes make an
ill u&s;e of the e&s;teem they were in for piety. <HI>Alexan|dra,</HI>
the widow of <HI>Alexander Janneus,</HI> had for &s;ome
time the government of <HI>Judea.</HI> She being a &startq;<HI>ve|$$ry
religious woman&endq;</HI> thought the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> might be
her be&s;t Coun&s;ellors, but &startq;they abu&s;ing her &s;impli|city
in this re&s;pect&endq;, though on other accounts &s;he
was a woman of very good capacity, &startq;got the ma|nagement
of all things into their own hands, con|demned

according to their own plea&s;ure; in a word, &s;he
governed other, the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> governed her<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> de B. J. lib. i. c. 5. &sect;. 2.</NOTE>&endq;.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> and <HI>Sadducees</HI> are plainly repre&s;ented
in the Go&s;pels as very different from each other, and
holding in a manner oppo&s;ite opinions. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> in
one place calls the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> &startq;the Sect oppo&s;ite to
that of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Ant. lib. xiii. c. 10 &sect;. 6. in.</NOTE>.&endq; They did at &s;ome times
join together in one and the &s;ame de&s;ign again&s;t our

and tempting him, de&s;ired him that he would &s;how them a
&s;ign from Heaven,</HI> Mat. xvi. 1. At other times they
attacked him &s;eparately, and endeavoured to en&s;nare,
or puzzle him with Queries &s;uitable to their &s;everal
&s;chemes, <HI>Matt.</HI> xxii. 23&mdash;34. We have one in&s;tance,
wherein their different principles drove them into very
different mea&s;ures, and occa&s;ioned a downright quar|rel.
When St. <HI>Paul</HI> was called before the council at
<HI>Jeru&s;alem, and perceived that the one part Were</HI> Saddu|cees
<HI>and the other</HI> Phari&s;ees, <HI>he cried out in the council,
<PB N="155" REF="173">
Men and Brethren,</HI> I am a <HI>Phari&s;ee&mdash;Of the hope

St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t had brought life and im|mortality
to light through the Go&s;pel,</HI> 2 Tim. i. 10.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, St. <HI>Paul's</HI> notions did directly contra|dict

wonderful, that one Sect laid hold of an advantage
again&s;t the other.</P>
<P>WITHOUT &s;taying any longer here, I &s;hall give
a pa&s;&s;age or two, in which <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> who was of the

&s;entiments concerning the&s;e points. The city of <HI>Jota|pata,</HI>

among other things, he &s;ays: &startq;All have mor|tal

from him, when it is the will of him that
gave it, have eternal prai&s;e, and durable hou&s;es

remain, having received an holy place in heaven,
from whence, after the revolution of ages they &s;hall
be again hou&s;ed in pure bodies. But the &s;ouls of

a re&s;emblance with the&s;e of <HI>Jo&s;ephus. For we know,
that if our earthly hou&s;e of this tabernacle were di&s;&s;olved,
we have a building of God, an hou&s;e not made with hands

<HEAD>CHAP. V.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the Jews and Samaritans expectations,

<HEAD TYPE="sub">I. The Jews had expectations of the Me&s;&s;iah, as a
temporal deliverer. II. Of the Jews requiring a

IV. The Jews and Samaritans &s;uppo&s;ed the Me&s;&s;iah
to be a Prophet as well as a King. V. Some
reflexions.</HEAD>
<P>_TWO things are plainly intimated
by the Evangeli&s;ts; that the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
nation had, about the time of our
Saviour, very general expectations
of the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah; and
that the Idea they formed of him,
was that of a powerful and victorious temporal
Prince.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, <HI>IT is intimated that they had very general ex|pectations
of the Me&s;&s;iah.</HI> The <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ent Prie&s;ts and
Levites from <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> to ask him (&s;c. <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bap|ti&s;t</HI>)
who art thou? and he confe&s;&s;ed and denied not: but
confe&s;&s;ed I am not the Chri&s;t. And they asked him, what
then?&mdash;and they which were &s;ent were of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI>
John <HI>i.</HI> 19.&mdash;24. And as the people were in expectation,
and all men mu&s;ed in their hearts of <HI>John,</HI> whether he
were the Chri&s;t or not, <HI>Luke iii.</HI> 15. Ch. <HI>ii.</HI> 25, 26.
<HI>John iv.</HI> 25.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT is intimated, that the Idea the <HI>Jews</HI>
then had of the Me&s;&s;iah, was that of a powerful tem|poral
Prince. The Di&s;ciples of Chri&s;t had the&s;e ap|prehen&s;ions;
therefore there <HI>aro&s;e a rea&s;oning among
<PB N="170" REF="188">
them, which of them &s;hould be greate&s;t,</HI> Luke ix. 46.
This notion was the ground of that petition pre&s;ented
to our Saviour by the mother of <HI>Zebedees</HI> children:
<HI>Grant that the&s;e my two Sons may &s;it, the one on the right
hand, and the other on the left in thy kingdome,</HI> Matt.
xx. 21.</P>
<P>THE common people, whenever they had formed
a great Idea of Je&s;us, from what he &s;aid or performed,
continually betrayed expectations of his a&s;&s;uming &s;ome
external marks of Royalty, and very forwardly offer
him their &s;ervice, <HI>John</HI> vi. 14, 15. This was the in|tention
of tho&s;e acclamations they made, and of that
&s;olemn &s;tate, with which they attended him at la&s;t into
<HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> the circum&s;tances of which are related by
all the four Evangeli&s;ts: <HI>And a very great multitude
&s;pread their garments in the way; others cut down branches
from the trees and &s;trewed them in the way; and the mul|titude
that went before, and that followed, cried, &s;aying,</HI>
HoHH&s;anna <HI>to the Son of</HI> David, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxi. 8, 9. <HI>Ble&s;|&s;ed
is the King that cometh in the name of the Lord,</HI> John
xii. 13. The Acclamations, and the ceremonies they
u&s;ed, &s;uffciently declare their meaning. When <HI>Jehu</HI>
had been anointed King, they that were with him, <HI>ha|&s;ted,
and took every man his garment and put it under
him, and blew the trumpet &s;aying,</HI> Jehu <HI>is King,</HI> 2 Kings
ix. 7.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. Antiq. 1. ix. c. 6. &sect;. 2.</NOTE></P>
<P>THESE were their expectations, this the notion they
had of the Me&s;&s;iah; as is evident from the many Im|po&s;tors
<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">See the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Coventry</HI> and <HI>Litchfield</HI>'s De&s;ence of Chri&s;t: Chap. i. particularly p. 29. fir&s;t edit.</NOTE> which aro&s;e about this time in <HI>Judea;</HI> all
which, according to <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> gained many followers.
But as &s;everal pa&s;&s;ages concerning them will appear
in other parts of this work, and one or two by and by
in this chapter, I &s;hall take no farther notice of them
in this place. There are pa&s;&s;ages of divers ancient
writers, in which the&s;e things are expre&s;sly a&s;&s;erted.
Mo&s;t of them have been already offered to the world
<PB N="171" REF="189">
in our own language; but neverthele&s;&s;e they cannot
be omitted here.</P>
<P>ONE is in <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> &startq;But that which principally
encouraged them to the war, was an ambiguous
oracle, found likewi&s;e in the &s;acred writings, that
about that time, &s;ome one from their country,
&s;hould obtain the empire of the world. This they
under&s;tood to belong to thera&s;elves<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">For this they had received (by tradition) that it was &s;poke of one of their Nation. Bi&s;hop of <HI>Cov.</HI> Defence, P. 26.</NOTE>. And ma|ny

<P>THERE are two Heathen Hi&s;torians, who have
mentioned this &s;ame thing. <HI>Suetonius</HI> in his life of <HI>Ve|&s;pa&s;ian</HI>
&s;ays, &startq;There had been for a long time, all o|ver
the <HI>Ea&s;t.</HI> a notion, firmly believed, that it was
in the Fates [<HI>in the decrees or books of the fates</HI>] that
at that time, &s;ome which came out of <HI>Judea,</HI> &s;hould
obtain the empire of the world. By the event it ap|peared
that prediction related to the Roman Em|perour.
The <HI>Jews</HI> applying it to them&s;elves went
Into a rebellion<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Percrebuerat Oriente toto vetus &amp; con&s;tans opinio: e&s;&s;e in fatis, ut eo tempore Judaea pro&s;ecti rerum potiren|tur. Id de Imperatore R. quantum eventu po&s;tea praedictum pasuit. Judaei ad &s;e trahentes, rebellarunt, Cap. iv.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>WHAT <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;ays is much to the &s;ame purpo&s;e.

Prodigies that preceded the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI>
he goes on: &startq;The generality had a &s;trong per|&s;wa&s;ion,

foretold <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Titus.</HI> But the com|mon
people, according to the u&s;ual influence of
human pa&s;&s;ions, having once appropriated to them|&s;elves
this va&s;t grandeur of the Fates, could not

<P>THERE is a pa&s;&s;age or two more which I would
give here, and which appear to me very material: they
are the words of <HI>Cel&s;us,</HI> who flouri&s;hed not long after
the middle of the &s;econd Century. They are cited by
<HI>Origen,</HI> from <HI>Cel&s;us</HI>'s, books again&s;t the Chri&s;tian Reli|gion,
in a good part of which he argued in the charac|ter
of a <HI>Jew.</HI> &startq;How could we, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> who had

and for that I re&s;erve it.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. THE Evangeli&s;ts have related many wonder|ful
works, of various kinds, which were performed
by our Saviour. And in &s;ome places they &s;ay, he
wrought <HI>&s;igns. And many other</HI> SIGNS <HI>truly did Je&s;us
<PB N="173" REF="191">
in the pre&s;ence of his di&s;ciples,</HI> John xx. 30. And St.
<HI>Peter</HI> tells the <HI>Jews,</HI> that Je&s;us was a <HI>man approved of
God among them by miracles, and wonders, and</HI> SIGNS,
<HI>which God did by him in the mid&s;t of them,</HI> Acts ii. 22.
But yet, they a&s;&s;ure us, that notwith&s;tanding this, the
<HI>Jews</HI> would be often a&s;king him for a <HI>Sign. Then cer|tain
of the Scribes and of the Phari&s;ees an&s;wered, &s;ay|ing,
ma&s;ter we would &s;ee a</HI> SIGN <HI>from thee,</HI> Matt, xii.
38. The <HI>Sadducees</HI> al&s;o had this demand to make.
<HI>The</HI> Phari&s;ees <HI>al&s;o with the</HI> Sadducees <HI>came, and tempt|ing
him, de&s;ired him that he would &s;hew them a &s;ign from
haven,</HI> Ch. xvi. I. Again, <HI>they &s;aid unto him, what
&s;ign &s;hewe&s;t thou then, that we may fee and believe thee?</HI>
John vi. 30. The &s;ign they wanted mu&s;t needs have
been of a different kind from any of tho&s;e, which Je|&s;us
had given them. The words that follow are &s;ome|what
remarkable: <HI>our fathers did eat manna in the de|&s;ert,
as it is written, he gave them bread from heaven to
eat,</HI> ver. 31. And the Apo&s;tle <HI>Paul,</HI> a good while af|ter
this, &s;ays; <HI>the</HI> Jews <HI>require a</HI> SIGN, I <HI>Cor.</HI> i. 22.</P>
<P>A &s;hort pa&s;&s;age or two from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> will confirm,
and explain this matter. Repre&s;enting the &s;tate of af|fairs
in <HI>Judea</HI> under <HI>Felix,</HI> he &s;ays: &startq;And deceivers

aiming at innovations and changes, per|&s;waded
the people into di&s;traction, and drew them
into the wilderne&s;&s;e; where they a&s;&s;ured them, God
would &s;hew them SIGNS OF LIBERTY.&endq; This is in
his <HI>jewi&s;h war.</HI> In his <HI>Antiquities</HI> he writes thus of the
&s;ame affair: &startq;And impo&s;tors and deceivers per|&s;waded
the multitude to follow them into the wil|derne&s;&s;e.
For they &s;aid they would there &s;hew

wrought by the power [or providence] of God<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. 20. c. 7. &sect;. 6.</NOTE>.&endq;

<P>THIS &s;uppo&s;ition is confirmed by an account,
which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has given of an affair, which happen|ed
in the latter end of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s government, A. D. 35,
or 36. &startq; Nor were the <HI>Samaritans, &s;ays he,</HI> free from
di&s;turbance. For there was among them a man
who made no &s;cruple of a lie, and contrived all he
&s;aid &s;o as might be&s;t plea&s;e the people. He publi&s;h|ed
orders that they &s;hould meet together, and go
with him up to mount <HI>Garizim,</HI> which is e&s;teemed
by them the mo&s;t holy of all mountains. He a&s;|&s;ured
them that when they were got to the top of it
he would &s;hew them the &s;acred ve&s;&s;els which had
been laid up there under ground by <HI>Mo&s;es</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. xviii. c. 5. &sect;. I.</NOTE>. They

taking what he &s;aid for truth, armed them&s;elves,
and po&s;ting them&s;elves in a certain village called
<HI>Tiratbaba,</HI> there received all that flocked to them,
intending to a&s;cend the mountain in a large body.
But a detachment of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s Soldiers, hor&s;e and
foot, having fir&s;t intercepted their pa&s;&s;age, fell up|on
them in the village, and at the fir&s;t attack, &s;lew
&s;ome, di&s;per&s;ed others, and took a good number
pri&s;oners, the chief of whom <HI>Pilate</HI> put to death&endq;.</P>
<P>THIS affair is a proof that the <HI>Samaritans</HI> were
now in expectation of &s;ome extraordinary events.
This deceiver accommodated his &s;peeches to the hu|mour
and &s;entiments of the people, and they credited
readily what he &s;aid. But this is not all: The &s;ub|&s;tance
of his promi&s;es is a proof, they were now in ex|pectation of &s;ome di&s;coveries and regulations concern|ing
matters of <HI>religion.</HI> For, certainly, if they found
the&s;e &s;acred ve&s;&s;els, they &s;uppo&s;ed they &s;hould have

&s;u&s;pected, that for <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> we ought to read <HI>Ozes.</HI> One

&s;tory related in his <HI>Chronicle</HI> is almo&s;t the very &s;ame
which is told in the &s;econd Book of <HI>Maccabees, ch.</HI> ii.

for <HI>Ozi,</HI> and <HI>Nebo</HI> for <HI>Garizim</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sub&s;titue pro Jeremia Ozin, pro monte Nebo Garizim cu tera conveniunt. Reland Di&s;&s;ert. de Monte Garizim. &sect;. 14.</NOTE> I &s;hall therefore
&s;et down here the account in the <HI>Maccabees.</HI> It is, I
think, an argument that according to traditions, which
they then had among them, the di&s;covery of the <HI>&s;a|cred
ve&s;&s;els</HI> would be immediately followed by very
glorious times; and con&s;equently, that this pa&s;&s;age
from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> is to the purpo&s;e for which I have al|leged
it. <HI>It was al&s;o contained in the &s;ame writing, that
the prophet being warned of God, commanded the taber|nacle
and the ark to go with him, as he went forth into the
mountain, where</HI> Mo&s;es <HI>climbed up, and &s;aw the heri|tage
of God. And when</HI> Jeremie <HI>came thither, he found
an hollow cave wherein he laid the tabernacle and the art,
and the altar of incen&s;e, and &s;topped the door. And &s;ome
of tho&s;e that followed him, came to mark the way, but
they could not find it. Which when</HI> Jeremie <HI>perceived,
he blamed them, &s;aying, As for that place, it &s;hall be un|known
until the time that God gather his people again to|gether,
and receive them unto mercy. Then &s;hall the Lord
&s;hew them the&s;e things, and the glory of the Lord &s;hall ap|pear,
and the cloud al&s;o as it was &s;hewed under</HI> Mo&s;es,
<HI>and as when</HI> Solomon <HI>de&s;ired that the place might be ho|nourably
&s;anctified,</HI> 2 Mace. ii. 4&mdash;8.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. IT has been &s;hewn that the <HI>Jews</HI> had now
expectations of the coming of the Me&s;&s;iah, and that
they hoped for a temporal &s;alvation from him. But it
is not to be thought, they looked for nothing el&s;e.
After the miracle of the five loaves, St. <HI>John</HI> &s;ays;
<HI>Then the&s;e men when they had &s;een the miracle which
<PB N="177" REF="195">
Je&s;us did, &s;aid, This is of a truth that prophet that
&s;hould come into the world. When Je&s;us therefore per|ceived
that they would come and take him by force, to
make him a king, be departed again into a mountain him|&s;elf
alone,</HI> John vi. 14, 15. The&s;e two characters
therefore of a <HI>Prophet,</HI> and a <HI>King,</HI> were joined toge|ther
in the thoughts of <HI>the&s;e men.</HI></P>
<P>THE woman of <HI>Samaria</HI> likewi&s;e plainly &s;uppo&s;es
the Me&s;&s;iah was to be a great <HI>Prophet.</HI> She <HI>knew</HI> that
when he who is called Chri&s;t was come, he would <HI>tell
them all things.</HI> Upon Je&s;us <HI>telling her all things that
ever &s;he did,</HI> &s;he concluded he was <HI>the Chri&s;t.</HI> And
&s;he &s;uppo&s;ed, this would be an argument with the
men whom &s;he went to, to believe the &s;ame thing:
And we find it had great weight with them, though
they were farther confirmed by what they afterwards
heard from Je&s;us them&s;elves. The expectation of
great di&s;coveries in matters of religion appears al&s;o in
the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t tran&s;cribed from <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. V. I choo&s;e to conclude this chapter with &s;ome
reflexions.</P>
<P>1. WE may now perceive one rea&s;on, why our
Ble&s;&s;ed Lord often forbade men to publi&s;h the cures
he had wrought upon them; why he &s;o often moved
from one place to another; why he &s;o rarely affirmed
in expre&s;s terms, in the hearing of the people, that he
was the Chri&s;t Whil&s;t they had &s;o &s;trong a per&s;wa|&s;ion,
that the Me&s;&s;iah would be a temporal deliverer,
there was a nece&s;&s;ity for this conduct. It was impo|&s;ible,
otherwi&s;e, to avoid giving umbrage to the Ro|man
government, and to hinder the people from ac|tually
making attempts that would have expo&s;ed them
to ju&s;tice. He therefore contented him&s;elf with de|claring
that the kingdome of heaven was at hand, that
the Father had &s;ent him, that he was he of whom <HI>Mo|&s;es</HI>
and the Prophets had written, that he was ble&s;&s;ed
who &s;hould not be offended in him (all which they
knew to be characters of the Me&s;&s;iah) wrought mi|racles,
preached righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e, and endeavoured to
<PB N="178" REF="196">
correct their fal&s;e &s;entiments and corrupt affections.
In a word, it was nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould do, ju&s;t as he
did, according to the divine character he &s;u&s;tains
throughout the Go&s;pels.</P>
<P>2. WE &s;ee here the ground of the different re&s;pect
which &s;eems to have been &s;hewn to <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI>
and <HI>Je&s;us, Many of the</HI> Phari&s;ees <HI>and</HI> Sadducces <HI>came
to his Bapti&s;m,</HI> Matth. iii. 7. And of others there
&s;eems to have been a general re&s;ort. And for &s;ome
time afterwards it was dangerous to deny the validity
or authority of his bapti&s;m: <HI>for all held</HI> John <HI>to be a
prophet,</HI> Matth. xxi, 26. Their general expectation of
the Me&s;&s;iah rai&s;ed their attention to <HI>John.</HI> But their
particular Idea of the <HI>Me&s;&s;ah</HI> di&s;gu&s;ted them again&s;t <HI>Je|&s;us.</HI>
He (&s;ays our Lord to them) <HI>was a burning and
&s;hining light, and ye were willing for a &s;ea&s;on to rejoyce in
his light,</HI> John v. 35. They had, no doubt, but that a
very great per&s;on was coming among them; and they
were plea&s;ed to hear <HI>John</HI> &s;ay, that he was his fore|runner:
but when Je&s;us came, he was not &s;uch a per|&s;on
as they wi&s;hed for.</P>
<P>3. WE &s;ee here the rea&s;on of the different reception
given to <HI>Je&s;us</HI> by the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and the <HI>people.</HI> The
&s;ame notions &s;eem to have been common to all, and
the pa&s;&s;ion of the people for <HI>liberty</HI> was as warm, as
that of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> for power and grandeur. But the
people could not &s;ee very far; and they hoped, even
contrary to pre&s;ent appearances, that Je&s;us might
&s;ome time undertake the deliverance they wanted. But
the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who had more penetration, &s;aw from
the beginning, that he was a man void of all worldly
ambition, and that no &s;uch principle would be grati|fied
under him. His peculiar ble&s;&s;ings were all be|&s;towed
on the <HI>poor in &s;pirit,</HI> the <HI>meek, and tho&s;e that
were per&s;ecuted for righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e &s;ake;</HI> he exhorted <HI>men
to pray, fa&s;t, give alms in &s;ecret,</HI> to entertain <HI>the poor,
the maimed, the holt, the blind,</HI> in hopes of being <HI>re|compen&s;ed
at the re&s;urrection of the ju&s;t;</HI> and he openly
neglected <HI>the traditions of the elders.</HI> They could be
<PB N="179" REF="197">
&s;ure from hence, that Je&s;us did not intend to enrich
his followers by worldly conque&s;ts; that this doctrine
was no prelude to an univer&s;al temporal empire; and
that according to the&s;e mea&s;ures, their darling princi|ples,
in&s;tead of prevailing, would be for ever di&s;|graced.
Therefore the&s;e men pur&s;ued him, almo&s;t
univer&s;ally, from fir&s;t to la&s;t, with an uninterrupted
cour&s;e of &s;ecret, or open malice.</P>
<P>4. THIS notion of theirs gives us the rea&s;on, why
many owned Je&s;us <HI>for a time,</HI> and then for &s;ook him.
They came in to him upon the &s;uppo&s;ition of his be|ing
a temporal deliverer of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> nation. But by
his conduct, or &s;ome things they heard from him,
they were convinced they had gone upon a wrong
foundation.</P>
<P>5. IT does al&s;o account for that &s;udden change in
the people at the concln&s;ion of our Saviour's mini&s;try.
They attend him with great &s;tate into <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and
a few daies after, they cry out, not this man but <HI>Bar|rabbas.</HI>
The rea&s;on &s;eems to be this: His not a&s;|&s;uming
then the character of a temporal prince, or at
le&s;t, not giving them &s;ome &s;ign of liberty, had been
a va&s;t di&s;appointment, and left a deep re&s;enment;
which rendered them &s;u&s;ceptible afterward of the
wor&s;t impre&s;&s;ions from the chief prie&s;ts and Pha|ri&s;ees.</P>
<P>6. THE particulars abovementioned may help us
to conceive the truth of what is related, <HI>Acts</HI> v. 26.
<HI>Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them
without violence; for they feared the people, le&s;t they
&s;hould have been &s;toned.</HI> Strange! That they &s;hould
now have &s;uch a zeal and affection for the di&s;ciples
of Je&s;us, whom they had &s;o lately de&s;ired with loud
voices to be crucified, as to be ready to do violence
to the officers of the council for their &s;ecurity. But
however &s;trange this may &s;eem, there is no manner
of rea&s;on to doubt the truth of it. What has been al|leged
from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> and <HI>Tacitus</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that tho'
often di&s;appointed, they were not di&s;heartned. Tho'
<PB N="180" REF="198">
Je&s;us had been cruci&s;ied, a &s;urpri&s;ing power appeared
in his di&s;ciples, and wonderful works were wrought by
them in the name of Je&s;us; which were infallible
proofs of his re&s;urrection and a&s;cen&s;ion. Hereupon,
undoubtedly, the hopes of the &s;alvation they wi&s;hed
for, revived in the&s;e men.</P>
<P>7. THE <HI>Jews</HI> expectation of a temporal deliverance
for their nation, nouri&s;hed and &s;trengthened by &s;en|&s;ual
pa&s;&s;ions, together with their prodigious wicked|ne&s;&s;e,
which they, in their fond imaginations, had re|conciled
with the peculiar friend&s;hip and favour of
God, does fully account for this peoples &s;o generally
rejecting and de&s;pi&s;ing Je&s;us, though there was the
fulle&s;t proof given, that he was he who was to come.
<HI>I am come,</HI> &s;ays our Lord, <HI>in my father's name, and
ye receive me not. If another &s;hall come in his own name,
him ye will receive,</HI> John v. 43. They were ready to
joyn any one, who made them promi&s;es of a temporal
&s;alvation, but they would not receive, or at le&s;t, not
hold to any one that did not. If they would have re|ceived
any one without this condition, they would
have received Je&s;us.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Of the great Corruption of the Jewi&s;h
People.</HEAD>
<P>_THE Evangeli&s;ts have repre&s;ented the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
nation as very corrupt and wicked about
the time our Saviour conver&s;ed and taught
in this world. When <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapiti&s;t
&s;aw many of the</HI> Phari&s;ees <HI>aad</HI> Sadducees
<HI>come to his Bapti&s;m, he &s;aid unto them, O generation of
Vipers, who hath warned you to flee from the wrath to
Come?</HI> Matth. iii. 7. Our Lord him&s;elf calls them
<HI>an evil and adulterous generation,</HI> Ch. xii. 39. When
they boa&s;ted of their relation to <HI>Abraham,</HI> and yet
&s;ought <HI>to kill him who had told them the truth,</HI> our Sa|viour
tells them: <HI>Ye are of your Father the Devil, and
the works of your father ye will do,</HI> John viii. 40&mdash;44.
Our Lord often intimates, that the true rea&s;on why
his Doctrine was &s;o little regarded by them, was this;
that their affections were entirely engaged by worldly
advantages, and they had no &s;incere love of truth or
virtue. <HI>This is the condemnation, that light is come into
the world; and men loved darkne&s;s rather than light be|cau&s;e
their deeds were evil,</HI> John iii. 19. <HI>How can ye
believe, which receive honour one of another, and &s;eek not
that honour which cometh from God only?</HI> Ch. v. 44,
And from many other parts of the Go&s;pels it is evi|dent,
their righteou&s;ne&s;&s;e con&s;i&s;ted in a regard to &s;ome
ritual parts of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI>'s Law, and in ob&s;erving the tra|ditional
rules of the elders; <HI>making broad their phylac|teries,
and enlarging the border of their garments; in pay|ing
tithes of mint and ani&s;e and cummin; while they o|mitted
<PB N="182" REF="200">
the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy
and faith,</HI> Matth. xxiii. 5&mdash;23.</P>
<P>THAT the corruption of the <HI>Jews</HI> is not at all ag|gravated
here, is evident from the character given of
tne&s;e times, or of tho&s;e very near them, by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
him&s;elf, who was zealous for the honour of his country.
&startq;<HI>E$ozar, &s;ays he,</HI> the chief man among the <HI>Sica|mi</HI>
<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Villains that went with &s;hort &s;words concealed under their clothes.</NOTE> was a de&s;endant <HI>Judas</HI> who had per|&s;waded
not a few of the <HI>Jews</HI> not to enrolle them|&s;elves,
when <HI>C$renius</HI> the <HI>Cen&s;or</HI> was &s;ent into <HI>Judea.</HI>
For then the <HI>Siearii</HI> con&s;pired again&s;t all that were
willing to &s;ubmit to the <HI>Romans.</HI> They treated all
&s;uch as public enemies:&mdash;Affirming they were
no better than &s;trangers, &s;ince they &s;urrendered to
the <HI>Romans</HI> tho&s;e privileges of their nation, which
ought to be precious to all <HI>Jews.</HI>&mdash;But all this was
mere preten&s;e, an I given out with no other view
than to cover their cruelty and avarice.&mdash;That
was indeed a time fruitful of all &s;orts of wickedne&s;&s;e
among the <HI>Jews;</HI> &s;o that no evil whatever was left
unpracti&s;ed. It is impo&s;&s;ilble for man to contrive
any new wickendne&s;&s;e, which was not then commit|ted.
All were corrupt in their private and pub|lic
character. They &s;trove to exceed each other in
impiety toward God, and inju&s;tice toward their
neighbour. The great men oppre&s;&s;ed the people,
and the people &s;trove to ruin them. The former
were ambitious of dominion and power, the latter
had an in&s;atiable thir&s;t of violence and plunder<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> de B. J. lib. vii. c. 8. 6. I.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="201">
IT appears from hence, that the corruption of this
people was general. If <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> had not made this
acknowledgement, it might have been proved by an
enumeration of the many acts of inju&s;tice and vilany
he has related, that all &s;orts of people were abandoned
to wickedne&s;&s;e, I think this is not needful: I &s;hall
however add two or three more pa&s;&s;ages.</P>
<P>IN his account of their affairs, whil&s;t <HI>Felix</HI> was
Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> he has the&s;e words: &startq;Such was
the impudence of the High Prie&s;ts, that they would
&s;end their &s;ervants to the &s;tore-hou&s;es to &s;ei&s;e and
bring away the tithes that belonged to the Prie&s;ts;
by which means &s;ome of the Prie&s;ts, who&s;e circum|&s;tances
were but &s;trait, peri&s;hed for want: &s;o far
did the violence of factious men prevail over ju&s;tice
and equity<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Antiq. lib. xx. cap. 7. &sect;. 8.</NOTE>.&endq; Did not our Saviour &s;ay very
truly; <HI>It is written, My hou&s;e &s;hall be called the hou&s;e
of prayer, but ye have made it a den of thieves?</HI> Matth.
xxi. 13.</P>
<P>NOT far off from this pa&s;&s;age there is another,
which may give us an idea of their hypocri&s;ie (a crime
they are often charged with in the <HI>Go&s;pels</HI>) and of
their artful and impudent preten&s;ions to religion, when
they intended the greate&s;t vilanies. <HI>Felix</HI> by a large
&s;um of money per&s;waded <HI>Dora,</HI> a native of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
and an intimate friend of the High Prie&s;t <HI>Jonathan</HI> to
undertake, that the &s;aid High Prie&s;t &s;hould be mur|dered.
<HI>Dora</HI> accordingly hired &s;ome of the<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">ibid. &sect;. 5.</NOTE> rob|bers
(&s;o <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> calls a &s;et of men the country was
then filled with) for this purpo&s;e. &startq;&s;ome of the&s;e
men coming up into the City, as if with a de&s;ign
to wor&s;hip God, and having &s;hort &s;words under
their coats, mixing them&s;elves with the multitude,
kill <HI>Jonathan.</HI> This murder pa&s;&s;ing unpuni&s;hed,
after this the robbers came in at the Fea&s;ts without
any manner of concern; and carrying, as before,
<PB N="184" REF="202">
&s;words under their clothes, and mixing with the
multitudes, they killed divers people; &s;ome whom
they reckoned their enemies, &s;ome whom they were
hired by others to de&s;troy. This they did, not
only in other parts of city, but within the bounds
of the temple it&s;elf<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">ibid.</NOTE>. For even there would
they kill men, and yet not &s;eem to commit any
crime. For this rea&s;on, it &s;eems to me, that God,
dete&s;ting their impiety, for&s;ook our city; and not
e&s;teeming the temple any longer a pure habitation
for him, brought the <HI>Romans</HI> again&s;t us, threw on
the city a fire to puri&s;y it, and delivered up us with
our wives and children to &s;ervitude, that by the&s;e
calamities we might learn wi&s;dome.&endq;</P>
<P>THEPE is another noted pa&s;&s;age of the &s;ame hi&s;to|rian,
which may not be omitted. &startq;I cannot &s;ay it
without regret, yet I mu&s;t declare, it is my opi|nion,
that if the <HI>Romans</HI> had delayed to come a|gain&s;t
the&s;e wretches, the City [<HI>viz. Jeru&s;alem</HI>]
would have been &s;wallowed up by an earthquake,

<P>&sect;. II. WE &s;hall pre&s;ently have occa&s;ion to take
notice of &s;everal things concerning <HI>Pilate;</HI> I &s;hall
here only &s;hew that PILATE was at this time Gover|nour
of <HI>Judea.</HI> St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Now in the</HI> FIFTEENTH
YEAR <HI>of the reign of</HI> Tiberius Ce&s;ar, PONTIUS PILATE
BEING GOVERNOUR OF JUDEA, <HI>the word of God came
unto</HI> John <HI>the Son of</HI> Zacharias <HI>in the wilderne&s;&s;e,</HI> Luke
iii, 1, 2. If St. <HI>Luke</HI> in this text intends, not the fif|teenth
year of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign from the death of <HI>Au|gu&s;tus,</HI>
but the fifteenth year of his Procon&s;ular power,
when he was made Collegue of <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> it may po&s;|&s;ibly
admit a debate, whether <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> was go|vernour
of <HI>Judea,</HI> when <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> began to
preach: therefore I have re&s;erved the con&s;ideration of
that particular for the next book. But there can be
no que&s;tion made, but that <HI>Pilate</HI> was governour of
<HI>Judea,</HI> at the time of our Saviour's crucifixion;
whether St. <HI>Luke</HI> be under&s;tood in that place, to &s;peak
of the <HI>Procon&s;ular</HI> Power of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> or of his <HI>&s;ole
empire</HI> after the death of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>THE fifteenth year of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Procon&s;ular Em|pire,
and the twelfth of his &s;ole Empire are pretty
near coincident. For the 15th of his Procon&s;ular
Empire is &s;uppo&s;ed to begin<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pagi Crit, in Baron. A. D. 25.</NOTE> about the 27th of <HI>Au|gu&s;t,</HI>
A. D. 25. And the 12th of his &s;ole empire be|gan
the 19th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> in the &s;ame year.</P>
<P>THERE is undoubtedly &s;ome difficulty in comput|ing
exactly the time, which the Evangeli&s;ts have al|lotted
to <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI>'s and our Saviour's mini&s;try.
But whether we under&s;tand St. <HI>Luke</HI> to &s;peak of the
<HI>fifteenth</HI> of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s procon&s;ular power, or of his
&s;ole empire; I think, that the earlie&s;t date of our Sa|viour's
<HI>crucifixion</HI> mu&s;t be that of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> Pa&s;&s;over,
which happened in the 15th year <HI>of Tiberius</HI>'s &s;ole Em|pire,
A. D. 29, and the late&s;t date the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> Pa&s;&s;over,

which happened in the 19th year of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s &s;ole
empire, A. D. 33.</P>
<P>TAKE any year from 29 to 33 inclu&s;ively; and
<HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> was governour of <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>THIS may be made appear in this manner. <HI>Tibe|rius</HI>
died the 16th of <HI>March,</HI> A. D. 37,<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pagi Critic. in Baron. A. 37. n. ii.</NOTE>. <HI>Vitellius</HI>
received the tidings of it at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. Ant, lib. xviii. cap. vi. p. 806. in.</NOTE> But <HI>Pilate</HI>
had been removed &s;ometime before this<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. v. &sect;. 2.</NOTE>, as is al|lowed
by all: how long before, we will nor now en|quire.
<HI>Pilate</HI> therefore was removed from his govern|ment
before the pa&s;&s;over A. D. 37. when he had been
there <HI>ten years.</HI> So <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays expre&s;ly: &startq;And
<HI>Pilate</HI> having been ten years in <HI>Judea,</HI> ha&s;tened a|way

received from <HI>Vitellius,</HI> not daring to refu&s;e<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Jo&s;eph. ibid.</NOTE>.&endq;
Sub&s;tract ten from 37, and it appears that <HI>Pilate</HI> was
governour of <HI>Judea,</HI> before the Pa&s;&s;over in A. D. 27,
and con&s;equently before our Saviour's la&s;t &s;ufferings.</P>
<P>THAT our Saviour was crucified in <HI>Judea,</HI> in the
reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> under <HI>Pontius Pilate,</HI> is the unani|mous
te&s;timony of Chri&s;tian writers; is particularly
mentioned<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Auctor nominis ejus Chri&s;tus, qui Tiberio imperitante, per PROCURATOREM POSTIUM PILATUM &s;upplicio affectus erat. Ann. lib. xv. cap. 44.</NOTE> by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> an Heathen author; and is
not denied by any. But this being a principal Fact,
I am not obliged to produce any pa&s;&s;ages relating to it
now. All I am concerned to do at pre&s;ent is, to &s;hew,
that according to the notes of time, mentioned by
the Evangeli&s;ts, <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> mu&s;t have been gover|nour
of <HI>Judea,</HI> when our Saviour was crucified.
This I pre&s;ume I have made appear from <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI>

his own country was under at that time.</P>

&s;aid unto him; I adjure thee by the living God, that thou
tell us, whether thou be the Chri&s;t, the Son of God. Je&s;us

Then the high prie&s;t <HI>RENT HIS CLOTHES,</HI> &s;aying, He
hath &s;poken bla&s;phemy, <HI>Matth.</HI> xxvi. 63&mdash;65.</P>
<P>IT has been thought by &s;ome, that the high prie&s;t
might not rend his clothes: But, that he might, and
did do &s;o, upon extraordinary occa&s;ions, will appear
from the following particulars. The Author of the
fir&s;t book of <HI>Maccabees</HI> &s;ays; <HI>Then</HI> Jonathan <HI>rent his
clothes, and ca&s;t earth upon his head,</HI> I Macc. xi. 71.
<HI>Jonathan</HI> was then High Prie&s;t: the occa&s;ion of this
action was his mens running away from their enemies.
Doftor <HI>Lightfoot,</HI> in his <HI>Hebrew</HI> and <HI>Talmudical Exer|citations</HI>
upon this text of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> quotes the&s;e
words from <HI>Maimonides: When witne&s;&s;es &s;peak out the
bla&s;phemy which they heard, then all hearing the bla&s;phe|my
are bound to rend their clothes.</HI> As the High Prie&s;t
among the <HI>Jews</HI> was one of their judges, and was pre|&s;ent
at their trials, he mu&s;t be comprehended in this
<PB N="191" REF="209">
rule. I &s;ubjoin to the&s;e a pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> Perhaps
it will not be thought to come up to our point, be|cau&s;e
he does not &s;peak of the <HI>High Prie&s;t</HI> in the &s;in|gular
number. But I do not &s;ee, why the per&s;on, who
was actually in the High Prie&s;thood, mu&s;t be exclud|ed;
and in one re&s;pect it exceeds the fact, now before
us For <HI>Caiaphas</HI> undoubtedly had on, at this time,
his ordinary clothes; whereas, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;peaks of the
prie&s;ts rending the garments which they wore in their
mini&s;trations at the temple.</P>
<P>THE ca&s;e was this: <HI>Florus,</HI> governour of <HI>Judea,</HI>
had plundered the &s;acred trea&s;ury at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">De Bell. J. lib. ii. cap. 14. &sect;. 6.</NOTE>,
and committed many other abu&s;es. Hereupon the
<HI>Jews,</HI> being highly provoked, were ready to break
out into war with the <HI>Romans.</HI> And a great number
of them, being got together into an open place in the
City, gave out many reflexions upon <HI>Floras. Jo&s;ephus</HI>
&s;ays, that upon this, &startq;The chief men and the High
Prie&s;ts, being filled with concern, RENT THEIR
GARMENTS and falling down upon their knees<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ibid. cap. 15. &sect;. 2.</NOTE>
be&s;eeched the people to be peaceable, and to bear
patiently what had pa&s;t already, rather than pro|voke
<HI>Florus</HI> to do &s;till wor&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN this tumult was appea&s;ed, <HI>Florus</HI> intending
(as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;uppo&s;es) to exact conditions the people
would not comply with, and thereby to bring on an
open war, &startq;called the chief men to him, and told
them, that he would e&s;teem this a te&s;timony of their
fidelity, and of their intention to be quiet for the
future, if the people would go out of the City, and
&s;alute his &s;oldiers, which were then coming from
<HI>Ce&s;area.</HI> &endq; The chief men of the <HI>Jews</HI> then called
the people to the temple, and de&s;ired them to &s;ub|mit
to the&s;e demands; but were not able to pre|vail
upon them. &startq;Then every Prie&s;t and Mini|&s;ter
of God, when they had brought forth the holy

Ve&s;&s;els, being clothed in the ve&s;tments which they
wear in their &s;acred functions, entreated them not
to exa&s;perate the <HI>Romans</HI> to come and take away
from them tho&s;e things which were con&s;ecrated to
God. Then might be &s;een the High Prie&s;ts them|&s;elves

prie&s;ts and elders and all the Council &s;ought fal&s;e witne&s;&s;e
again&s;t him,</HI> Matth. xxiv. 59. <HI>And they led Je&s;us away
to the High Prie&s;t: and with him were a&s;&s;embled the chief
prie&s;ts and the elders and the &s;cribes,</HI> Mark xiv. 53. I
know not, but this may be thought by &s;ome an im|propriety,
in the Evangeli&s;ts expre&s;&s;ion; becau&s;e
&s;trictly there was but one High Prie&s;t among the <HI>Jews</HI>
at a time. This is certainly very true, and the Evan|geli&s;ts
appear to have known it very well. But then,
all tho&s;e who had ever bore the office of High Prie&s;t
were called &s;o likewi&s;e, and I believe &s;ome others be|&s;ides:
I need not now enquire who. But &s;o far is this
&s;tile from affording any ju&s;t objection again&s;t the &s;a|cred
Hi&s;torians, that it may very well be reckoned
one proof of their being well acquainted with the
things, of which they have written; &s;ince it is the
u&s;ual &s;tile of <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> I need not produce any parti|cular

unto you one at the Pa&s;&s;over,</HI> John xviii. 39.</P>
<P>&sect;. VIII. IN the account, the Evangeli&s;ts have given
us of <HI>Pilate's</HI> conduct, there are &s;everal things very
remarkable; which ought therefore to be con&s;idered,
and accounted for. The high prie&s;ts, and elders of
the <HI>Jews</HI> were very earne&s;t for our Saviour's condem|nation:
but <HI>Pilate</HI> appears very backward to pro|nounce any
&s;entence upon him. <HI>He knew that for envy
they had delivered him,</HI> Matth. xxvii. 18. When they
charged him with &s;tirring up the people, and &s;aying
that he was a King, <HI>Pilate &s;aid unto him; art thou the
King of the</HI> Jews? <HI>Luke xxiii. 2. John</HI> xviii. 33. <HI>Je&s;us
an&s;wered, my kingdom is not of this world,</HI> ver. 36. Pi|late
<HI>therefore &s;aid unto him, Art thou a King then? Je|&s;us an&s;wered, thou &s;aye&s;t that I am a King. To this end
was I born, and for this cau&s;e came I into the world,
that I &s;hould bear witne&s;s to the truth,</HI>&mdash;Pilate <HI>&s;aith un|to
<PB N="195" REF="213">
him, what is truth? And when he had &s;aid this, he
went out again unto the</HI> Jews, <HI>and &s;aith unto them, I find
in him no fault at all,</HI> ver. 37, 38.</P>
<P>THERE being no proof of any di&s;turbances cau&s;ed
by our Saviour among the people, <HI>Pilate</HI> enquires in|to
this charge, of his <HI>taking upon him</HI> the title of a
King: and perceiving, that he intended not by it any
worldly government, but only that his de&s;ign had
been to teach men &s;ome certain principles, he asks
him, <HI>What is truth?</HI> or what was that truth which
he profe&s;&s;ed to teach? But not being &s;ollicitous to
know particularly what the&s;e principles were, and be|ing
&s;atisfied from what he had already heard from our
Saviour, that there was nothing &s;editious in them, he
did not &s;tay for an an&s;wer to this que&s;tion; but im|mediately
goes out to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and tells them: <HI>I
find in him no fault at all</HI></P>
<P>GROTIUS &s;uppo&s;es that <HI>Pilate,</HI> by the King|dome
our Saviour &s;poke of, under&s;tood &s;uch a King|dome
as the <HI>Stoicks</HI> a&s;cribed to their wi&s;e men, a King|dome
no more prejudicial to the Roman Government
than theirs<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Grot. in Joh. xviii. 38.</NOTE>. He certainly conceived of our Saviour
as a Leader only of &s;ome innocent &s;ect, and appre|hended,
that it was nothing but envy and &s;ecret ma|lice,
that moved the <HI>Phan&s;ees</HI> to demand judgement
again&s;t him.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding what <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;aid of the inno|cence
of je&s;us, the <HI>Jews</HI> were &s;till pre&s;&s;ing for a &s;en|tence
again&s;t him. However <HI>Pilate</HI> could not yet be
prevailed on to an&s;wer their demands, but ordered him
to be &s;courged; and the &s;oldiers platted <HI>a crown of
thorns, and put it upon his head, and they put on him a
purple robe,</HI> John xix. 1, 2. abu&s;ed and mocked him.
<HI>Pilate,</HI> hoping they might be &s;atisfied with this, <HI>went
forth again; and &s;aith unto them, behold 1 bring him
forth to you, that ye may know that I find no fault in him,</HI>
ver. 4. <HI>When the chief prie&s;ts therefore and the officers
&s;aw him, they cried out, &s;aying, crucifie him, crucifie him.</HI>
<PB N="196" REF="214">
Pilare <HI>&s;aith unto tham: Take ye him and crucifie him: for
I find, no &s;ault in him. The</HI> Jews <HI>an&s;wered him, we have
a law, and by our law he ought to die, becau&s;e he made
him&s;elf the &s;on of God.</HI> WHEN PILATE THEREFORE
HEARD THAT SAVING HE WAS THE MORE AFRAID,
<HI>ver.</HI> 6, 7, 8.</P>
<P>MANY learned and judicious expo&s;itors under&s;tand
by the&s;e la&s;t words, that <HI>Pilate</HI> became yet more a|fraid
than before to pa&s;s &s;entence of condemnation up|on
Je&s;us; le&s;t after all, he &s;hould prove to be &s;ome
extraordinary Per&s;on. They think, that having, pro|bably,
received &s;ome accounts of our Saviour's mira|cles,
and hearing this charge, that he <HI>had made him&s;elf
the &s;on of God,</HI> he was brought into &s;ome doubts whe|ther
he might not be &s;ome uncommon per&s;on, like
tho&s;e Heroes or Demi-Gods, which were &s;o much
&s;poken of among the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans;</HI> and there|fore
he was &s;ei&s;ed with a fre&s;h fear of being con|cerned
in his death<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Metuens ob res miras de eo auditas ne forte verum e&s;&s;et or|tam eum divino &s;atu, &s;icut Romani &amp; Graeci de Heroibus &s;uis cre|debant. Grot, in loc. vid. &amp; Hammond, &amp;c.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE words will bear another &s;en&s;e, and ever &s;ince
I have read <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> in whom there are divers in&s;tances
of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> zeal about this time, and of tumults and
&s;editions which they run into, upon the le&s;t affront of|fered
to their religious in&s;titutions, &s;ome of which tu|mults
<HI>Pilate</HI> had been witne&s;&s;e to, I have under&s;tood
the&s;e words in a different &s;en&s;e; and have thought that
<HI>Pilate</HI> finding they intere&s;ted their religion in this
cau&s;e, and that they were re&s;olute in it, became afraid,
he mu&s;t at la&s;t &s;ubmit to them. And I am glad to find,
that I am not &s;ingular in this interpretation. <HI>Beza</HI> &s;ays
upon this place: &startq;He was not without rea&s;on afraid,
that an open &s;edition might happen, if he did not
comply with the multitude<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><HI>Magis metuit]</HI> Ergo jam antea percul&s;us erat, alternante ni|mirum con&s;cienti&acirc;, &amp; clamoribus Judaeorum, nunc etiam legem praetexentium: non temer&egrave; veritus, ne tandem &s;editio aperta erum|peret, ni&s;i multitudinis voluntati obtemperaret.

<P><PB N="197" REF="215">
<HI>BUT this &s;en&s;e being liable ro an objection from an
expre&s;&s;ion St.</HI> John <HI>u&s;es after this, it will be needful
to con&s;ider what follows.</HI> Pilate <HI>having heard this,</HI>
went again into the Judgment Hall, and &s;aith unto Je&s;us,
Whence art thou? but Je&s;us gave him no an&s;wer. Then
&s;aith <HI>Pilate</HI> unto him, &s;peake&s;t thou not unto me? Know|e&s;t
thou not, that I have power to crucifie thee, and have
power to relea&s;e thee? Je&s;us an&s;wered, thou coulde&s;t
have no power at all again&s;t me, except it were given
thee from above: therefore he that delivered me unto thee,
hath the greater &s;in. And from thenceforth <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;ought
to relea&s;e him, <HI>John</HI> xix. 9&mdash;12.</P>
<P>THESE la&s;t words may be reckoned an objection
again&s;t the &s;en&s;e, in which I under&s;tand the words
above-mentioned. But certainly St. <HI>John</HI> does not
hereby intend, that <HI>Pilate</HI> then <HI>began</HI> to &s;eek to re|lea&s;e
Je&s;us. He has, before this, related divers at|tempts
which <HI>Pilate</HI> had made to bring the <HI>Jews</HI> to tem|per.
What he means hereby is, that he <HI>&s;till</HI> &s;ought to
relea&s;e him; that upon hearing what Je&s;us &s;aid in this
la&s;t examination, he made <HI>another</HI> trial of the <HI>Jews,</HI>
to &s;ee, if they could not be contented. Our Lord had
maintained his innocence, told <HI>Pilate</HI> that he could
have no power again&s;t him, if it had not been allowed
by the providence of God for particular ends and rea|sons;
and that they who had delivered him to him,
had been guilty of an heinous and aggravated crime.
<HI>Pilate</HI> therefore, being &s;till &s;atisfied of his innocence,
made one and another attempt afrer this, to bring the
<HI>Jews</HI> to con&s;ent to his being relea&s;ed. But at length,
<HI>the voices of them and of the chief Prie&s;ts prevailed,</HI> Luke
xxiii. 23. <HI>When</HI> Pilate <HI>&s;aw that he could prevail nothing,
but rather a tumult was made,</HI> Matth. xxvii. 24. <HI>then
delivered he him unto them to be crucified,</HI> John xix. 16.</P>
<P><PB N="198" REF="216">
So that, whether the <HI>&s;ear</HI> which &s;ei&s;ed <HI>Pilate,</HI> upon
the <HI>Jews</HI> telling him, that Je&s;us had <HI>made him&s;elf the
&s;on of God,</HI> was a fear ari&s;ing from an apprehen&s;ion,
that he might be &s;ome extraordinary per&s;on, and more
than a man; or whether it was an apprehen&s;ion of di&s;|turbances
and tumnlts, if he did not hearken to the
<HI>Jews;</HI> yet it is evident from the pa&s;&s;ages la&s;t quoted,
and from many others in the Go&s;pels, that the Evan|geli&s;ts
have repre&s;ented <HI>Pilate's</HI> condemnation of our
Lord, as exported from him.</P>
<P>HE told them once and again, that he <HI>found no
fa$$t in him:</HI> he had him &s;courged, and brought him
out to them, in a mock royal dre&s;&s;e; hoping they
might be &s;atisfied with this puni&s;hment and di&s;grace.
It being his cu&s;tom at the Pa&s;&s;over to relea&s;e to them
&s;ome pri&s;oner of their nation, and the people being ga|thered
together in great numbers, and now demanding
this favour of him; he propo&s;ed to them, that Je&s;us
might be the per&s;on. But they being moved by the
High Prie&s;ts, <HI>de&s;ired that</HI> Barabbas <HI>might be relea&s;ed;</HI>
a criminal &s;o infamous, that no one not void of all
&s;hame would have &s;poke for him; a. man that had
been taken up in an in&s;urrection again&s;t the Roman
Government, and that had committed robbery and
murder. Not being able, by all the&s;e methods, to
move the Compa&s;&s;ion or equity of the <HI>Jews;</HI> nor ob|&s;erving
that there was any party among the common
people, that favoured Je&s;us; and being willing <HI>to con|tent
the people, he delivered Je&s;us unto them to be cruci&s;i|ed,</HI>
Mark xv. 15. The Evangeli&s;ts are unanimous in
the account, that this &s;entence was pronounced only <HI>to
content the Jews,</HI> that is, either to &s;ecure the peace of
the province, or to maintain his intere&s;t with the peo|ple,
when he &s;aw that nothing could &s;atisfie or appea&s;e
their rage, but the death of Je&s;us. <HI>When</HI> Pilate <HI>&s;aw
that he could prevail nothing; but rather a tumult was
made, he took water, and wa&s;hed his hands before the
multitude, &s;aying, I am innocent from the blood of this ju&s;t
per&s;on: &s;ee ye to it. Then an&s;wered all the people and
<PB N="199" REF="217">
&s;aid, His Bloud be on us and on our children,</HI> Matth.
xxvii. 24, 25. Luke xxiii. 24, 25. John xix. 14&mdash;16.</P>
<P>IT will &s;eem &s;trarge to &s;ome, that a Roman Go|vernour
&s;hould have any inducements to comply with
the demands of people, contrary to his own judge|ment
and inclination. But he that con&s;iders the ac|count,
we have of the Principles and behaviour of the
<HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation at this time, will be &s;atisfied, the Evan|geli&s;ts
have here given a ju&s;t and true repre&s;entation of
this tran&s;action; and will be convinced, that a Ro|man
Governour, with all his authority, could not
pa&s;s by any thing, which they apprehended to be a
breach on their religious con&s;titution, without ha|zarding
the peace of his province. All this will not
ju&s;tifie an unrighteous &s;entence, but that this was the
ca&s;e is plain.</P>
<P>WE have &s;een that the High Prie&s;ts pretended,
that Je&s;us had been guilty of bla&s;phemy, in making
<HI>him&s;elf the &s;on of God,</HI> and that <HI>by their Law he ought to
die,</HI> John xix. 7. And <HI>Pilate</HI> had had experience of
their prodigious firmne&s;&s;e and zeal for all the parts of
their religion: there are two particular proofs, they
gave him of this, related by <HI>Je&s;ephus;</HI> the one on oc|casion
of his placing the Roman En&s;igns in <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI>
the other upon his attempting to bring water into the
city with money taken out of the &s;acred Trea&s;ury.
The former is related by <HI>Jo&s;phus</HI> thus: &startq;<HI>Pilate</HI> the
Prefect of <HI>judea,</HI> &s;ending his army from <HI>Ce&s;area</HI> and
putting them into winter quarters at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
brought the carved images of <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> which are on
the En&s;igns into the City, in violation of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
laws; &s;ince our Law forbids the making of any
images. For which rea&s;on the former governours
were wont to come into the city with en&s;igns de&s;ti|tute
of tho&s;e ornaments. <HI>Pilate</HI> was the fir&s;t, who
&s;et up images in <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and he did it privately,
the army making their entry in the night time. But
as &s;oon as the people knew it, they went in a va&s;t
body to <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI> making earne&s;t &s;upplication for
<PB N="200" REF="218">
many days, that the images might be removed. He
not granting their petition, thinking it would be
di&s;honourable to the Emperour to do &s;o, and they
&s;till per&s;i&s;ting in their reque&s;t to him, on the &s;ixth
day, having privately ordered his &s;oldiers to their
arms, he &s;eated him&s;elf on his Tribunal, in the <HI>Cir|cus,</HI>
near which he had placed his men, that they
might be in readine&s;&s;e; And when the <HI>Jews</HI> came
to him thither with their petition, his &s;oldiers ha|ving,
upon a &s;ignal given, &s;urrounded them, he
threatned them with immediate death, if they did
nor give over their clamours and return home.
They then threw them&s;elves on the ground, and
o$uered their necks to the &s;word, and &s;aid: They
could die much more ea&s;ily, than they could dare
to do any thing contrary to the wi&s;dom of their
Lawes. <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;urprized at their firmne&s;&s;e in the
ob&s;ervation of their Laws, immediately gave or|ders
for bringing back the images from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>
to <HI>Ce&s;area</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 18. c. 4. &sect;. 1.</NOTE>,&endq;</P>
<P>THERE immediately follows after this an account
of the di&s;turbance rai&s;ed at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> by <HI>Pilate's</HI> at|tempting
to bring water into the city at the expence of
money taken out of the &s;acred trea&s;ury. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays,
That &startq;many thou&s;ands got together, crying out,
that he ought to de&s;i&s;t from this undertaking; that
many vented mo&s;t reproachful &s;peeches again&s;t him,
&mdash;Some were killed and others wounded in this tu|mult,
but at length the Sedition was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>BOTH the&s;e attempts of <HI>Pilate</HI> were made at the be|ginning
of his government. Some learned men, who
&s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Pilate</HI> came into <HI>Judea,</HI> A. D. 25, place
them in that year<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Cleric. Hi&s;t. Ecc.</NOTE> And others, who &s;uppo&s;e that
<HI>Pilate</HI> was not Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> till the year 27,
place them there<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ba&s;nage Ann. Pol. Eeel.</NOTE>. I am of opinion, the fir&s;t at|tempt
was made by him at the beginning of the fir&s;t
winter after his arrival in the province, and the
<PB N="201" REF="219">
other the &s;ummer following. Undoubtedly, he had
&s;een the <HI>Jews</HI> firmne&s;&s;e upon both the&s;e occa&s;ions,
and po&s;&s;ibly upon &s;ome others, before the time of
the event, which we are con&s;idering.</P>
<P>WE have another attempt of <HI>Pilate's,</HI> of the &s;ame nature,
mentioned in the letter, which <HI>Agrippa</HI> the elder
&s;ent to <HI>Caligula;</HI> as this letter is given us by <HI>Philo.</HI> In
&s;ome particulars it has a great re&s;emblance with the &s;to|ry,
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has told, of <HI>Pilate's</HI> bringing the <HI>en&s;igns</HI> in|to
<HI>jeru&s;alsm;</HI> and in others it is very different from it:
which has given occa&s;ion to &s;ome learned men to &s;up|po&s;e,
that <HI>Philo</HI> has been mi&s;taken<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. Ba&s;nage Ann. P. E. A. 27. n. 6.</NOTE> For my own
part, as I make no doubt, but <HI>Jo&s;ephus's</HI> account of
the <HI>en&s;igns</HI> is true; &s;o I think, that <HI>Philo</HI> may al&s;o be
relied on for the truth of a fact, he has mentioned as
happening in his own time in <HI>Judea:</HI> And con&s;equent|ly
I judge them to be two different facts.</P>
<P>AGRIPPA, reckoning up to <HI>Caligula</HI> the &s;eve|ral
favours conferred on the <HI>Jews</HI> by the Imperial fa|mily,
&s;ays: &startq;<HI>Pilate</HI> was Procurator of <HI>Judea.</HI> He
not &s;o much out of re&s;pect to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> as a mali|cious
intention to vex the people, dedicates gilt
&s;hields and places them in <HI>Herod's</HI> palace within the
holy city. There was no figure upon them, nor
any thing el&s;e which is forbidden, except an in&s;cri|ption,
which expre&s;&s;ed the&s;e two things, the name
of the per&s;on who dedicated them, and of him, to
whom they were dedicated. When the people per|ceived
what had been done,&mdash;they de&s;ired this in|novation
of the &s;hields might be rectified, that their
ancient cu&s;toms, which had been pre&s;erved through
&s;o many ages, and had been hitherto untouched by
Kings and Emperours, might not now be violated.
He refu&s;ed their demands with roughne&s;&s;e: &s;uch
was his temper, fierce and untractable. They then
cried out, Don't you rai&s;e a &s;edition your&s;elf; Don't
you di&s;turb the peace by your illegal practices.&mdash;It
is not <HI>Tiberius's</HI> plea&s;ure, that any of our lawes
<PB N="202" REF="220">
&s;hould be broken in upon. If you have received
any edict, or letter from the Emperour to this pur|po&s;e,
produce it, that we may leave you and de|pute
an amba&s;&s;y to him, and entreat him to revoke
his orders. This put him out of all temper; for he
was afraid, that if they &s;hould &s;end an amba&s;&s;y,
they might di&s;cover the many male-admini&s;trations
of his government, his extortions, his unju&s;t decrees,
his inhumane cruelties. This reduced him to the
utmo&s;t perplexity. On the one hand, he was afraid
to remove things, that had been once dedicated, and
was al&s;o unwilling to do a favour to men that were
his &s;ubjects: And on the other hand, he knew ve|ry
well the inflexible &s;everity of <HI>Tiberius.</HI> The chief
men of the nation ob&s;erving this, and perceiving,
that he repented of what he had done, though he
endeavoured to conceal it, write a mo&s;t humble
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letter to <HI>Tiberius.</HI> It is needle&s;s to
&s;ay, how he was provoked, when he had read the
account of <HI>Pilate's</HI> &s;peeches and threatnings; the
event &s;hewing it &s;ufficiently. For he &s;oon &s;ent a let|ter
to <HI>Pi$ate</HI> reprimanding him for &s;o audacious a
proceeding, requiring al&s;o, that the &s;hields &s;hould
be removed. And accordingly they were carried
from the metropolis to <HI>Ce&s;area</HI> by the &s;ea &s;ide, cal|ed
<HI>Seba&s;te</HI> from your great grandfather, that they
might be placed in the temple there con&s;ecrated to
him: and there they were repo&s;ited<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Philo de leg. ad Cai. p. 1033, 1034.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE reader doubtle&s;s ob&s;erves the &s;everal different
circum&s;tances of this &s;tory from that of the <HI>en&s;igns,</HI>
which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has told; and particularly, that this
dedication of the <HI>&s;hields</HI> was made &s;ome time after <HI>Pi|late</HI>
had been in the province; becau&s;e now he had
been guilty of many male-practices in his government:
whereas the fact, which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has related, happen|ed
very &s;oon after his arrival in the province. This cir|cum&s;tance
may be an argument, that <HI>Philo</HI> did not
<PB N="203" REF="221">
take the <HI>en&s;igns</HI> for <HI>&s;hields;</HI> it being very unlikely, he
&s;hould mi&s;take the time of &s;uch an affair.</P>
<P>I cannot however be po&s;itive, that this fact happen|ed
before our Saviour's crucifixion But yet methinks,
it may help us to form an idea, how <HI>Pilate</HI> under&s;tood
that threatning &s;peech of the <HI>Jews, If thou let this man
go, thou art not</HI> Ce&s;ar's <HI>friend,</HI> John xix. 12. For, &s;up|po&s;ing
this affair of the <HI>&s;hields</HI> not to have happened till
after our Saviour's crucifixion (which however is not
certain) yet undoubtedly <HI>Pilate</HI> had, before this time,
committed many abu&s;es. And though he might be ve|ry
well &s;atisfied, the acquitting Je&s;us and &s;etting him
at liberty would not be deemed any crime, if the ca&s;e
was fairly &s;tated; yet he might be unwilling to pro|voke
the principal men of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation to &s;end <HI>Ti|berius</HI>
an account of his behaviour on other occa&s;ions.
This we may the more ea&s;ily credit, not only becau&s;e
at all times the remon&s;trances of a province were very
much dreaded by the Prefects, but becau&s;e they were
more e&s;pecially &s;o under <HI>Tiberius;</HI> who was very &s;oli|citous

that he &s;uffered the Pre&s;idents to remain in the pro|vinces
for &s;o long a time, becau&s;e they all endeavour|ed
to enrich them&s;elves, and the &s;horter time they
&s;taid in them, the more eager they were to improve
it to that end<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jo&s;. Ant. lib. xviii. cap. 7. &sect; 5.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS we &s;ee how <HI>Pilate,</HI> a man chiefly &s;wayed by
a regard to his private intere&s;t, might be in &s;ubjection
to a clamorous and tumultuous people, in an affair,
in which they pretended their religion was concerned.</P>
<P>&sect;. IX. I have in the <HI>&s;econd Chapter,</HI> &s;hewn at large,
what power the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> magi&s;tracy and the Roman Go|vernour
were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of at this time in <HI>Judea.</HI> But
the ju&s;tne&s;&s;e of the Evangeli&s;ts account upon this head
(in which likewi&s;e they are perfectly harmonious) ap|pears
to me &s;o very material, that I know not how to
<PB N="204" REF="222">
forbear making here two or three remarks upon occa|&s;ion
of <HI>Pilate's</HI> pronouncing the Sentence of condem|nation
on Je&s;us; which is a proof of his &s;upreme au|thority
in that country, in capital cau&s;es.</P>
<P>1. ACGORDING to the Evangeli&s;ts then, the <HI>Jews</HI>
had not now the power of life and death. I have
&s;hewed, that according to other ancient authors, they
had it not at this time, and could not have it, whil&s;t
in the &s;tate of a Roman province.</P>
<P>2. ACCORDING to the Evangeli&s;ts <HI>Pilate</HI> had the
power of life and death. So he has al&s;o in <HI>Philo</HI> and
<HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> This is a place, in which later writers would
have been in great danger of tripping. The accura|cy
of the Evangeli&s;ts is remarkable on two accounts.
1. <HI>Judea,</HI> though &s;ometimes called a province, was
properly a branch of the province of <HI>Syria</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Ituraeique &amp; Judaei, defunctis regibus <HI>Sohemo</HI> atqne <HI>Agrippa,</HI> PROVINCIAE SYRIAE ADDITI. Tacit.

What <HI>Tacitus</HI> here &s;ays, was done upon the death of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> had been the ca&s;e before his reign: and was &s;o particularly, in the time of <HI>Pilate;</HI> as is evident, in that he was di&s;placed by <HI>Vitellius</HI> Pre&s;i|dent of <HI>Syria.</HI> Vid. &amp; Jo&s;eph. de Bell. lib. ii. cap. 8. &sect;. 1.

yet had a Roman Governor re&s;iding in it with <HI>&s;upreme</HI>
authority, which was a very uncommon thing. 2. <HI>Pi|late's</HI>
proper title was that of <HI>Procurator.</HI> The reader
may perceive this from my tran&s;lations of many pa&s;|&s;ages
concerning the Roman Governours of <HI>judea,</HI> in
which in conformity to <HI>Jo&s;ephus's</HI> &s;tile, I al&s;o call
them <HI>Procurators. Tacitus</HI> al&s;o calls <HI>Pilate Procura|tor</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Ann. 15. cap. 44. See above p. 188. n. h.</NOTE>. Now this was ordinarily the title of the officer
that took care of the Emperour's <HI>revenue</HI> in a pro|vince,
and is equivalent to that of <HI>Quae&s;tor</HI> under the
Republic, or in a province &s;ubject to the Senate; which
officer hid not the power of life and death. But <HI>Pi|late</HI>
though he had the <HI>title</HI> of Procurator, had the
<HI>Power</HI> of a Pre&s;ident. The Evangeli&s;ts u&s;ually give
<HI>Pilate, Felix,</HI> and <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> the title of <HI>Governour,</HI> a ge|neral
word, and very proper according to the u&s;age of
<PB N="205" REF="223">
the be&s;t writers, and of <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> in particular, in many
places.</P>
<P>3. ACCORDING to the Evangeli&s;ts, the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
Council, having, as they pretended, convicted Je&s;us
of bla&s;phemy, and judged him guilty of death, they
go with him to <HI>Pilate:</HI> and they &s;eem to have expec|ted,
that <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;hould confirm their &s;entence, and &s;ign
an order, that he might be puni&s;hed accordingly. And
they afterwards openly and confidently in&s;i&s;t: upon it,
that he &s;hould not acquit a per&s;on, who, they &s;aid,
had been guilty of a crime, which, according to their
law, was capital. <HI>The</HI> Jews <HI>an&s;wered him, we have a
law, and by our law he ought to die, becau&s;e he made
him&s;elf the &s;on of God,</HI> John xix. 7. This appears to
me very ob&s;ervable: But yet, nothing is more likely,
than that they &s;hould talk in this way; &s;ince they were
governed by the <HI>Romans</HI> according to their own lawes;
as I have &s;hewn above<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">See p. 96,</NOTE>. The&s;e are the remarks
I had to make in this place.</P>
<P>BUT I would al&s;o take this opportunity of adding a
text, not yet in&s;i&s;ted on, which, if I under&s;tand it
aright, is a fre&s;h indication, that according to the &s;a|cred
writers, the <HI>Jews</HI> had not now &s;upreme power
within them&s;elves. When the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> elders had brought
Je&s;us before <HI>Pilate, he &s;aid</HI> to them: <HI>What accu&s;ation
bring you again&s;t this man? They an&s;wered and &s;aid unto
him,</HI> IF HE WERE NOT A MALEFACTOR, WE WOULD
NOT HAVE DELIVERED HIM UP UNTO THEE, <HI>John</HI>
xviii. 29, 30. The original word, and our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
word <HI>Malefactor,</HI> I think, u&s;ually denote a criminal
guilty of one of the wor&s;t of crimes: &s;uch as are ordi|narily
puni&s;hed with death, perpetual impri&s;onment,
the mines, gallies, or &s;ome &s;uch very heavy puni&s;h|ment.
The&s;e words then, in their mouthes, import
thus much: 1. &startq;If the crime, he is charged with,
were not capital, we &s;hould have puni&s;hed him our
&s;elves, and not have come to you. 2. If he were
<PB N="206" REF="224">
not really guilty, we would not have accu&s;ed him. &endq;
But to return to the cour&s;e we were in.</P>
<P>&sect;. X. <HI>PILATE</HI> having at length pa&s;&s;ed &s;en|tence
on Je&s;us, and delivered him to be crucified, it
will be proper next to con&s;ider, what is &s;aid of an in|&s;cription
put upon the cro&s;&s;e. <HI>And</HI> Pilate <HI>wrote a title
and put it on the cro&s;&s;e: and the writing was</HI> JESUS OF
NAZARETH THE KING OF THE JEWS, <HI>John</HI> xix. 19, 20.
This was the u&s;ual cu&s;tom of the <HI>Romans,</HI> when any
were condemned to death, to affix to the in&s;trument of
their puni&s;hment, or to order to be carried before them
a writing, expre&s;&s;ing the crime for which they &s;u&s;tered.
And this writing was called in <HI>Latin, Title,</HI> which word
St. <HI>John</HI> has made u&s;e of. It will be &s;ufficient to give

<P>&sect;. XII. EVERY one mu&s;t needs ob&s;erve the &s;coffs
and deri&s;ions our Saviour met with. There are three
or four in&s;tances recorded in the Evangeli&s;ts. One was,
whil&s;t he was in the High Prie&s;t's hou&s;e. <HI>Then did they
<PB N="207" REF="225">
&s;pit in his face, and buffeted him, and others &s;mote him
with the palms of their hands; &s;aying, prophe&s;y unto us
thou Chri&s;t, who is he that &s;mote thee?</HI> Matt. xxvi. 67,
68. Mark xiv. 65. <HI>Pilate</HI> hearing our Lord was of
<HI>Galilee</HI> &s;ent him to <HI>Herod;</HI> and before he was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
by him, <HI>Herod with his men of war &s;et him at nought:
and mocked him and arayed him in a gorgeous robe,</HI> Luke
xxiii. 11. He was in&s;ulted and mocked by the &s;oldiers,
when <HI>Pilate</HI> ordered him to be &s;courged the fir&s;t time,
that by that le&s;&s;er puni&s;hment he might &s;atisfie the <HI>Jews,</HI>
and &s;ave his life; as is related by St. <HI>John</HI><NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">John xix. 1, 2. See Dr. <HI>Clark's</HI> paraphra&s;e of the&s;e two ver&s;es.</NOTE>. After
<HI>Pilate</HI> had condemned him to be crucified, the like in|dignities
were repeated by the &s;oldiers, as, we are a&s;|&s;ured
by two Evangeli&s;ts, <HI>Matt,</HI> xxvii. 27&mdash;31. <HI>Mark</HI>
xv. 16&mdash;20. <HI>And they &s;tripped him and put on him a
&s;carlet robe, and when they had platted a crown of thorns,
they put it on his head, and a reed in his right hand:
and they bowed the knee before him, and mocked him, &s;ay|ing,
Hail King of the</HI> Jews. <HI>And they &s;pit upon him, and
took the reed, and &s;mote him on the head.</HI></P>
<P>THESE are tokens of contempt and ridicule, which
were in u&s;e at that time. <HI>Dio,</HI> among the other in|dignities
offered to <HI>Sejanus,</HI> the favourite of <HI>Tiberius</HI>
(in who&s;e reign our Saviour was crucified) as they were
carrying him from the Senate-hou&s;e to pri&s;on, particu|larly
mentions this; &startq;That they &s;truck him on the
head<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Dio. lib. 58. p. 628. A.</NOTE>.&endq; But there is one in&s;tance of ridicule,
which happened &s;o &s;oon after this time, and has &s;o
great a re&s;emblance with what our Saviour met with,
that it ought to be &s;et down here at length. <HI>Caligula,</HI>
the Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> had in the very beginning of
his reign given <HI>Agrippa</HI> the Tetrarchie of his uncle
<HI>Philip,</HI> being about the fourth part of his Grandfather
<HI>Herod's</HI> dominions, with the right of wearing a Diadem
or Crown. When he was &s;etting out from <HI>Rome</HI> to
make a vi&s;it to his people, the Emperour advi&s;ed him
to go by <HI>Alexandria,.</HI> as the be&s;t way. When he came
<PB N="208" REF="226">
thither, he kept him&s;elf very private; but the <HI>Alex|andrians</HI>
having got intelligence of his arrival there,
and of the de&s;ign of his Journey, were filled with en|vy,
as <HI>Philo</HI> &s;ays, at the thoughts of a <HI>Jew's</HI> having the
title of <HI>King;</HI> many ways they &s;hewed their indigna|tion:
One was this:</P>
<P>&startq;THERE was one <HI>Carabas,</HI> a &s;ort of di&s;tracted
fellow that in all &s;ea&s;ons of the year went naked a|bout
the &s;treets. He was &s;omewhat between a mad
man and a fool, the common je&s;t of boys, and other
idle people. This wretch they brought into the the|atre,
and placed him on a lofty &s;eat, that he might
be con&s;picuous to all: Then they put a thing made
of paper on his head for a crown, the re&s;t of his
body they covered with a matt in&s;tead of a Robe,
and for a Sceptre one put into his hand a little piece
of a reed, which he had ju&s;t taken up from the
ground. Having thus given him a mimic Royal
dre&s;&s;e, &s;everal young fellows with poles on their
&s;houlders came and &s;tood on each &s;ide of him as his
guards. Then there came people toward him, &s;ome
to pay their homage to him, others to a&s;k ju&s;tice of
him, and &s;ome to know his will and plea&s;ure con|cerning
affairs of &s;tate: and in the croud were loud
and confu&s;ed acclamations of <HI>Maris, Maris;</HI> that
being, as they &s;ay, the <HI>Syriac</HI> word for Lord,
thereby intimating whom they intended to ridicule.
by all this mock &s;hewe<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> In Flacc. p. 970. B. C.</NOTE>; <HI>Agrippa</HI> being a <HI>Syri|an,</HI>

<P>&sect;. XIII. BEFORE our Saviour was had away to be
crucified, he was <HI>&s;courged. Then relea&s;ed he</HI> Barabbas
<HI>unto them; and when he had</HI> SCOURGED <HI>Je&s;us, he deli|vered
him to be crucified,</HI> Matth, xxvii. 26, <HI>Mark</HI> xv.

15. That it was the u&s;ual cu&s;tom of the <HI>Romans,</HI> be|fore
execution, to &s;courge per&s;ons condemned to ca|pital
puni&s;hment, is evident from many examples re|corded
in ancient hi&s;torians. I &s;hall &s;et down from
them in the margin two or three in&s;tances in the ori|ginal
words<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Mi&s;&s;ique lictores ad &s;umendum Supplicium, nudatos virgis $aedunt, Liv. lib. ii. c. 5.

<P>&sect;. XIV. ANOTHER particular mentioned here,
is, that our Saviour bore his Cro&s;&s;e. <HI>And they took Je|&s;us
and led him away; and he bearing his cro&s;&s;e went
forth,</HI> John xix. 16, 17. But he having been fatigued
by a long examination, and a double &s;courging (as it
&s;eems), they were obliged after he had gone a &s;hort
way, to put it upon another. <HI>And they laid hold on one</HI>
Simon a Cyrenian: <HI>and on him they laid the cro&s;s, that he
might bear it after Je&s;us,</HI> Luke xxiii. 26. Mark xv. 21.</P>
<P>THIS was the con&s;tant practi&s;e among the <HI>Romans,</HI>
for criminals to carry their own cro&s;&s;e. In&s;omuch that
<HI>Plutarch</HI> makes u&s;e of it as an illu&s;tration of the mi&s;erie
of vice: &startq;that every kind of wickedne&s;&s;e produces
its own particular torment, ju&s;t as every malefactor,
when he is brought forth to execution, carries his
own cro&s;&s;e<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Plu|$rch. de iis qui &s;ero puniuntur. p. 554. A. Pari&s;. 1624.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>&sect;. XV. IT appears from the Evangeli&s;ts that our
Lord was crucified without the City. <HI>And he bearing
his cro&s;s went forth to a place called the place of a &s;kull,
which is called in the</HI> Hebrew Golgotha, <HI>John</HI> xix. 17.
<HI>For the place where Je&s;us was crucified was nigh to the
city,</HI> ver. 20. And the Apo&s;tle to the <HI>Hebrews</HI> has
<PB N="210" REF="228">
li&s;tewi&s;e mentioned this circum&s;tance: <HI>Wherefore Je&s;us
al&s;o&mdash;&s;uffered without the gate,</HI> Heb. xiii. 12.</P>
<P>THIS is conformable to the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> Law, and to
examples mentioned in the <HI>Old Te&s;tament. And the
Lord &s;aid unto</HI> Mo&s;es, <HI>the man &s;hall &s;urely be put to
death: all the congregation &s;hall &s;tone him with &s;tones
with out the camp,</HI> Numb xv. 35. <HI>Then they carried him</HI>
[Naboth] <HI>forth out of the City, and &s;toned him with
&s;tones, that he died,</HI> 1 Kings xxi. 13. This was done at
<HI>Je&s;reel,</HI> in the territories of the King of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> not far
from <HI>Samaria.</HI> And if this cu&s;tom was practi&s;ed there,
we may be certain, the <HI>Jews</HI> did not choo&s;e that cri|minals
&s;hould be executed within <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the &s;anc|tity
of which they had &s;o high an opinion of, and
which they were very zealous to pre&s;erve free from all
ceremonial impurity, though they defiled it with the
practi&s;e of the mo&s;t horrid immoralities. It is po&s;&s;ible
indeed, they might, in their &s;udden and ungoverned
rage, a thing they were mighty &s;ubject to at this
time, upon any affront offered to their Lawes or Cu&s;|toms,
put per&s;ons, who thus provoked them, to death,
upon the Spot, in the City, or the Temple, or where|ever
they found them: But whenever they were calm
enough to admit the form of a legal proce&s;&s;e, I dare
&s;ay, they did not approve of an execution within the
City.</P>
<P>AND among the <HI>Romans</HI> this cu&s;tom was very com|mon<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Plautus in Milite glorio&s;o, Act. ii. Seen. 4.

<HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 50&mdash;53. <HI>John</HI> xix. 38&mdash;40. <HI>And it may
be fairly concluded, the rulers of the</HI> Jews <HI>did not
di&s;approve of it: Since they were &s;olicitous, that the
bodies might be taken down, and not hang on the

the implacable malice of the

But the Roman Officers and Governours were far from

<P><HI>AT</HI> The&s;&s;alonica, The <HI>Jews</HI> which believed not, moved

bring them [<HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI>] out to the people. And when

whom <HI>Ja&s;on</HI> has received, and the&s;e all do contrary to the
decrees of <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> &s;aying, that there is another king, one

them go, <HI>Acts</HI> xvii. 5.-9. <HI>This was a piece of great

<P>S T. <HI>Paul</HI> preached a year and &s;ix months at <HI>Corinth,</HI>

of <HI>Seneca</HI> the Stoic Philo&s;opher, and then deputy
of <HI>Achaia,</HI> to give any judgement upon the ca&s;e. He
protected <HI>Paul</HI> from their rage, &s;topped the pro&s;ecution,
and did not &s;o much as give <HI>Paul</HI> the trouble of replying
for him&s;elf. <HI>And he continued there [at</HI> Corinth] <HI>a year

when</HI> Gallio <HI>was deputy of</HI> Achaia, <HI>the</HI> JEWS MADE INSUR|RECTION

when the town-clerk had appea&s;ed the people, he &s;aid, Ye

And yet he could not be brought to condemn <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P>NOT that I think, that <HI>Felix</HI> did <HI>Paul</HI> all the ju&s;tice
he ought to have done: far from it. After the fir&s;t
hearing of <HI>Paul</HI> and the chief prie&s;ts and elders at <HI>Ce|&s;area,</HI>
he ought to have relea&s;ed him: and his detain|ing
an innocent man in pri&s;on, &s;o long as he did <HI>Paul,</HI>
and leaving him in chains, when he went out of the
province, were very unrighteous actions.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays, <HI>But after two years</HI> Portius Fe&s;tus
<HI>came into</HI> Felix <HI>room: and</HI> Felix <HI>willing to</HI> SHEW THE
JEWS A PLEASURE, <HI>left</HI> Paul <HI>bound,</HI> Acts xxiv. 37. I
believe, that <HI>Felix</HI> at this time &s;hewed the <HI>Jews</HI> a dou|ble
<PB N="220" REF="238">
plea&s;ure; relea&s;ed robbers and other criminals,
and <HI>left Paul bound.</HI> The former plea&s;ure St. <HI>Luke</HI> has
omitted, according to his great candour and modera|tion
ob&s;ervable upon divers occa&s;ions in other parts of
his hi&s;tory. But I make very little doubt, but it was
now done. <HI>Jo&s;epus</HI> has particularly taken notice that
<HI>Albinus,</HI> Succe&s;&s;or of <HI>Porcius Fe&s;tus,</HI> did &s;o, when he
left the province: and that he aimed at plea&s;ing the
<HI>Jews</HI> in it. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that thereby the pri&s;ons were
emptied, but the country was filled with robbers.<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;. Ant. 20. c. 8. &sect;. 5.</NOTE>.
<HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Albinus</HI> were both of them di&s;agreeable in
their admini&s;tration. It is likely, they both took the
&s;ame method of paci&s;ying the <HI>Jews</HI> at the conclu&s;ion.
Perhaps <HI>Felix's</HI> conduct was the pattern <HI>Albinus</HI> follow|ed:
nor was it, I &s;uppo&s;e, an uncommon thing for
Governours to relea&s;e &s;ome pri&s;oners at their leaving
a province.</P>
<P>PORCIUS FESTUS was al&s;o manife&s;tly un|ju&s;t to
<HI>Paul,</HI> in that he did not &s;et him at liberty, but
con&s;trained him to appeal to <HI>Ce&s;ar.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though they did not do <HI>Paul</HI> all the ju&s;tice
they ought to have done; yet they did not condemn
him to death, as the <HI>Jews</HI> de&s;ired. It is plain, they
with&s;tood very pre&s;&s;ing &s;ollicitations, and po&s;&s;ibly,
con&s;iderable offers of money. <HI>Felix</HI> gave him a great
deal of liberty, after the fir&s;t hearing at <HI>Ce&s;area:</HI> Acts
xxiv. 23. which, we may &s;uppo&s;e, was al&s;o allowed by
<HI>&s;eftus.</HI> Though they had neither of them re&s;olution
enough to relea&s;e <HI>Paul</HI> again&s;t the inclinations of the
people of their province, they both give plain indica|tions,
they thought him an innocent man. And it
cannot be que&s;tioned, but that <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> tran&s;mitted a fa|vourable
account of him to <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>IN order to find out the true rea&s;on and foundation
of this conduct, I mean, of the favour &s;hewed to the
di&s;ciples of Je&s;us by the Roman officers; it is needful
to con&s;ider the grounds they go upon, and the rea|&s;ons

the cau&s;e, wherefore they accu&s;ed him, I brought him forth
into their council, whom I perceived to be accu&s;ed of que|&s;tions
of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge
worthy of death, or of bonds, <HI>Acts</HI> xxiii. 28, 29.</P>
<P><HI>AND with this agrees al&s;o the account which</HI> Fe&s;tus
<HI>gave of</HI> Paul's <HI>affair at length to King</HI> Agrippa. And
after certain days, King <HI>Agrippa</HI> and <HI>Bernice</HI> came unto
<HI>Ce&s;area</HI> to &s;alute <HI>Fe&s;tus.</HI> And when they had been there
many days, <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> declared <HI>Paul's</HI> cau&s;e unto the King,
&s;aying, There is a certain man left in bonds by <HI>Felix.</HI> A|bout
whom, when I was at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the chief prie&s;ts
and the elders of the <HI>Jews</HI> informed me, de&s;iring to have
judgment again&s;t him. To whom I an&s;wered, It is not the
manner of the <HI>Romans</HI> to deliver any man to die, before
that he which is accu&s;ed have the accu&s;ers face to face.&mdash;
Therefore when they were come hither, without any delay,
on the morrow I &s;at on the judgment Seat, and I command|ed
the man to be brought forth. Again&s;t whom, when the
accu&s;ers &s;tood up, they brought none accu&s;ations of &s;uch
things as I &s;uppo&s;ed: but had certain que&s;tions again&s;t him
of their own &s;uper&s;tition, and of one je&s;us, which was dead,
whom <HI>Paul</HI> affirmed to be alive. And becau&s;e I doubted
of &s;uch manner of que&s;tions, I asked him, whether he would
go to <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and there be judged of the&s;e matters. But
when <HI>Paul</HI> had appealed to be re&s;erved unto the hearing
of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> I commanded him to be kept till I might &s;end
him to <HI>Ce&s;ar.</HI> Then <HI>Agrippa</HI> &s;aid unto <HI>Fe&s;tus,</HI> I would
al&s;o hear the man my&s;elf:&mdash;And on the morrow, when
<HI>Agrippa</HI> was come, and <HI>Bernice,</HI> with great pomp,&mdash;
at <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> commandment <HI>Paul</HI> was brought forth. And
<HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> &s;aid, King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and all men which are here
pre&s;ent. with us, Ye &s;ee this man, about whom <HI>ALL</HI> the
multitude of the <HI>Jews</HI> have dealt with me, both at <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem,</HI>
and al&s;o here, crying, that he ought not to live any
<PB N="222" REF="240">
longer. But when I found that he had committed nothing
worthy of death, and that he him&s;elf hath appealed to
<HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> I have determined to &s;end him. Of whom <HI>I
HAVE NO CERTAIN THING TO WRITE UNTO MY LORD:</HI>
Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and e&s;pe|cially
before thee, 0 King <HI>Agrippa,</HI> that after examina|tion
had <HI>I MIGHT HAVE SOMEWHAT TO WRITE.</HI> For
it &s;eemeth to me unrea&s;onable to &s;end a pri&s;oner, and not
withal to &s;ignifie ths crimes laid again&s;t him, <HI>Acts</HI> xxv.
13-27.</P>
<P>STRANGE! <HI>Felix,</HI> it is likely, left behind him
&s;ome memorial concerning this pri&s;oner, and <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI>
had given <HI>Paul</HI> and his accu&s;ers a &s;olemn hearing at
<HI>Cefarea:</HI> The high prie&s;t and elders and all the multi|tude
of the <HI>Jews</HI> had dealt with him about <HI>Paul</HI> once
and again, at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and at <HI>Ce&s;area: Fe&s;tus</HI> &s;eems
to have &s;pared no pains to go to the bottom of the
matter: and yet, after all, he brought him before
<HI>Agrippa</HI> that he <HI>might have &s;omewhat to write to Au|gu&s;tus.</HI> According to this account, the <HI>Roman Empire</HI>
mu&s;t have had no Jaws, at this time, again&s;t new &s;ects
in religion, or the leaders of them; provided they in|jured
no man's civil property, and gave no di&s;tur|bance
to other people in their wor&s;hip.</P>
<P>LET us however &s;ee the progre&s;&s;e of this <HI>examination</HI>
before <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and <HI>Bernice,</HI> and tho&s;e who were with
them. <HI>Paul</HI> acquaints them with the manner of his
life from the fir&s;t, informs them of his conver&s;ion,
freely declares his principles and conduct; tells them,
that he had <HI>&s;een a light from heaven, and heard a voice;</HI>
that he had been &s;ent unto the <HI>Gentiles, to open their
eyes, and to turn them from darkne&s;&s;e to light, that they
might receive forgivene&s;&s;e of &s;ins, and inheritance among
them that are &s;antified by faith that is in Je&s;us.</HI> He lets
them know, that he had not been <HI>di&s;obedient to the
heavenly vi&s;ion, but &s;hewed fir&s;t unto them of</HI> Dama&s;cus,
<HI>and at</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>and throughout all the coa&s;ts of</HI> Judea,
<HI>and then to the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>that they &s;hould repent and turn
to God;</HI>&mdash;<HI>that having obtained help of God, he continued
<PB N="223" REF="241">
unto this day, witne&s;&s;ing both to &s;mall and great, that
Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;uffer, and that he &s;hould be the fir&s;t that
&s;hould ri&s;e from the dead, and &s;hould Jhew light unto the
people and to the</HI> Gentiles, <HI>Acts</HI> xxvi. 13-23</P>
<P><HI>PAUL</HI> here acknowledgeth two things mo&s;t con|trary
to the general opinion of the <HI>Jews</HI> at that time;
<HI>Fir&s;t, That Chri&s;t &s;hould &s;uffer;</HI> and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> He men|tions
particularly his commi&s;&s;ion <HI>to go to the Gentiles;</HI>
which thing when he related in his &s;peech to the people
at <HI>Jeru&s;alem, they lift up their voices, and &s;aid, Away
with &s;uch a fellow from the earth; for it is not fit that he
&s;hould live,</HI> Acts xxii. 22, 23. And he now declares,
that he had propagated the&s;e principles every where
with all his might.</P>
<P>WELL, what is the re&s;ult? Why truly, <HI>Paul's</HI> di&s;|cour&s;e
appears to <HI>Fejtus</HI> &s;o extravagant, that he tells
him he was <HI>be&s;ide</HI> him&s;elf; only he &s;oftens the charge a
little, by &s;ubjoining, that it was <HI>much learning</HI> that
<HI>made him mad.</HI> But &s;till there was no <HI>crime</HI> di&s;cerned.
Nay, after all this, <HI>Paul</HI> had the pre&s;ence of mind to
deliver a &s;olemn wi&s;h, that not only <HI>Agrippa,</HI> but al&s;o
<HI>all that heard him that day, were not only almo&s;t but alto|gether
&s;uch as he was except</HI> his <HI>bonds. And when he had
thus &s;poken, the king ro&s;e up, and</HI> Bernice, <HI>and they that
&s;at with them. And when they were gone a&s;ide, they talk|ed
between them&s;ehes, &s;aying, this man doth nothing wor|thy
of death or of bonds. Then &s;aid Agrippa</HI> (a <HI>Jew,</HI> but
well acquainted with the Roman Con&s;titution) <HI>This
man might have been &s;et at liberty, if he had not appeal|ed
unto</HI> Ce&s;ar, <HI>Acts</HI> xxvi. 30, 32.</P>
<P>THE &s;umm, I think, is this; that &s;ince St. <HI>Paul</HI> had
affirmed in his de&s;en&s;e before <HI>Felix,</HI> that <HI>they had not
found him in the temple di&s;puting with any man, neither
rai&s;ing up the people, neither in the &s;ynagogues nor in the city;</HI>
Acts xxiv, 12. and before <HI>Fe&s;tus,</HI> that <HI>neither again&s;t the
law, neither again&s;t the temple, nor yet again&s;t</HI> Ce&s;ar, <HI>had
he offended any thing at all:</HI> Ch. xxv. 8. And, &s;ince the
<HI>Jews</HI> had brought no proofs of any &s;uch offen&s;es; but
only there were &s;ome differences between <HI>Paul</HI> and the
<PB N="224" REF="242">
<HI>Jews,</HI> concerning <HI>certain que&s;tions of their own &s;uper&s;ti|tion</HI>
[religion]; <HI>Paul</HI> was an innocent man, and might
have been very ju&s;tly &s;et at liberty, and left to him|&s;elf
to go and propagate his principles in the way he
had done hitherto.</P>
<P>THIS then was the rea&s;on of this conduct, they
were not u&s;ed to interpo&s;e their authority in differences
purely religious: There was no act of &s;edition, inju|&s;tice,
or violence proved again&s;t <HI>Paul,</HI> or any of his
companions: And the&s;e were the only things, which
the&s;e officers had a right to puni&s;h.</P>
<P>HERE are therefore two things, which we are to'
look for &s;ome foreign proof of; namely, the fierce op|po&s;ition
made by the <HI>Jews</HI> again&s;t the followers of
Je&s;us Chri&s;t; and then, in the next place, that the
Roman officers had no right, according to the con&s;ti|tution
of the Roman government at that time, to pu|ni&s;h
men for innocent principles, but only for wicked
practi&s;es.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. To the fir&s;t point, the proceedings of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> little needs to be &s;aid. Their character<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">) Dio. l. 49. D. p. 405.</NOTE> for
violence is &s;o allowed, that no one can well &s;u&s;pect the
Evangeli&s;ts have mi&s;repre&s;ented them: not to &s;ay,
that it was by no means their intere&s;t to &s;ay the&s;e
things of them, if not true. I &s;hall however allege a
pa&s;&s;age or two to this purpe&s;e. <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr,</HI> in his
Dialogue with <HI>Trypbo,</HI> writ about the 140th<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vid. Pagi Critic. in Baron. A. C. 148.</NOTE> year
of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Aera,</HI> &s;ays, that in his time, &startq;the
<HI>Jews</HI> cur&s;ed<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Dialog. p. 234. B.</NOTE> in their Synagogues all that believed
in Chri&s;t. This <HI>&s;oys he,</HI> is all you can do. You have
not now the power of killing us your&s;elues, becau&s;e
others have the government of things. But this you
have done, whenever you have been able. Nor have
any other people &s;hewed &s;o much enmity again&s;t us
<PB N="225" REF="243">
and Chri&s;t as you, who have been like wi&s;e the au|thors
of all tho&s;e prejudices, which others havecon|ceived
again&s;t that righteous per&s;on and us his fol|lowers.
For after that you had crucified that one
unblameable and righteous man (by who&s;e &s;tripes
they are healed who go to the father through him)
when you knew, that he was ri&s;en from the dead,
and a&s;cended up into &startq;heaven, according as the pro|phecies
had foretold he &s;hould; you were &s;o far
from repenting of your evil deeds, that you &s;ent out
from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> cho&s;en men into all the world, giving
out that the &s;ect of the Chri&s;tians is athei&s;tical, and
&s;aying all tho&s;e evil things of us, which they, who
know us not, do &s;till &s;ay of us<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid. CD.</NOTE>. &endq; And <HI>Tertullian</HI>
affirms the &s;ame thing: that the <HI>Jews</HI> were the prin|cipal
authors of the evil reports, which were &s;pread
abroad concerning the Chri&s;tians<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Et crediditvulgus Judaeo. Quod enim aliud genus &s;eminarium e&s;t infamiae no&s;trae? Tertul. ad Nat. 1. 1. c,. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>&startq;. III. MODERATION and equity toward men of
a different religion are more uncommon things. And
therefore, it will be needful to be more particular on
this head, and to account for the protection, which.
the Heathen officers gave St. <HI>Paul</HI> and others, when
the multitude would have mobbed them, or when the
<HI>jewi&s;h</HI> Magi&s;trates demanded a judicial &s;entence again&s;t
them.</P>
<P>I &s;hall therefore &s;hew that the Roman People did at
this time protect all men in the practi&s;e of their &s;eve|ral
religious rites and in&s;titutions.</P>
<P>IN the fir&s;t place, I &s;hall con&s;ider, how they treat|ed
the Heathen people in tho&s;e provinces which they
had &s;ubdued.</P>
<P>AND &s;econdly. I &s;hall give a brief account of the
treatment, which the <HI>Jews</HI> received from them.</P>
<P>1. I &s;hall con&s;ider how they treated the Heathen
people, in tho&s;e provinces, which they &s;ubdued to
their obedience.</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="244">
<HI>LIVIE</HI> informs us, that the <HI>Anagnini,</HI> a people
in <HI>Italie,</HI> having di&s;obliged the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Senate
took away from them &s;everal privileges, which they
had let them enjoy to that time. &startq;Their &s;enates were
di&s;&s;olved, and their Magi&s;trates were deprived of
all power and authority, except what was nece&s;&s;ary
for the admini&s;tration of their religious rites<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Anagninis, quique arma Romanis intulerant&mdash;concilia, con|nubiaq; adepta: &amp; magi&s;tratibus, praeterquam &s;acrorum curatione, interdictum. Liv. lib. ix. cap. 43. n. 24.</NOTE>.&endq;
This was done in the year of the City 449, before
Chri&s;t 305; and is a proof, that they e&s;teemed all

<P>THE people of <HI>Syacu&s;e</HI> in <HI>Sicilie</HI> had an ancient
cu&s;tom of choo&s;ing an annual prie&s;t to <HI>Jupiter.</HI> It is
one of the heavy charges, which <HI>Cicero</HI> brings again&s;t
<HI>Verres,</HI> that whil&s;t he was Praetor of that province,
he had ob&s;tructed the people there, in the u&s;ual me|thod
of the choice, in order to get into the prie&s;thood
a creature of his own<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">&mdash;Sacerdotia: quibus in rebus non &s;olum jura, &s;ed etiam deorum rdigiones immortalium omnes repudiavit.

And, whenever he had &s;een any &s;uch in any town or
city, as he travelled in his province, he would &s;end to
the people, and inform them of a de&s;ire he had to pur|cha&s;e
of them the Statue of &s;uch or &s;uch a God or God|de&s;&s;e.
Sometimes the people out of fear of his re&s;ent|ments
complied with his de&s;ires, though with much
regret. But others were more re&s;olute, and told him
plainly, &s;uch things could not be done without im|piety.

&s;end his &s;ervants in the night time to (real images

before her temple. &startq;The curious workman&s;hip of it

<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> received very con&s;iderable favours and

not to go &s;o high as this. I take notice of this,
only becau&s;e the <HI>Jews</HI> enjoyed under the <HI>Romans</HI> the
mo&s;t exten&s;ive privileges out of <HI>Judea,</HI> which had
been granted by <HI>Alexander</HI> and his immediate &s;ucce&s;|&s;ors;

and becau&s;e, the privileges, they received fir&s;t
from them, &s;eem to have been, in a great mea&s;ure,
the models of tho&s;e immunities which were granted by
the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>FOR <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that &startq;<HI>Seleucus Nicalor</HI> gave them
[the <HI>Jews</HI>) the privileges of citizens in all the cities
which he built in <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> and in lower <HI>Syria,</HI> and e|ven
in <HI>Antioch</HI> the metropolis of his kingdome, and
made them equal to the <HI>Macedonians</HI> and <HI>Grecians;</HI>
which rights they &s;till<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph Ant. ubi &s;upra. See <HI>Pridemix</HI> Conn. Part. I. Book viii. year before Chr. 293. p. 572.</NOTE> enjoy.&endq;</P>

was, that he by an edict had forbid the <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
to &s;end any money out of that province to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.
Cicero</HI> endeavours to defend <HI>Flaccus's</HI> conduct in this,
as well as other matters; but <HI>Cicero</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sequitur auri ilia invidia Judaici&mdash;Cum aurum Judaeo|rum nomine, quotannis ex Italia, &amp; ex omnibus ve&s;tris provinciis Hiero&s;olymam exportari foleret, Flaccus fanxit edicto, ne ex A&s;ia exportari liceret.

the <HI>Jews</HI> did then &s;end money to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> annually
from <HI>Italie,</HI> and from all the provinces &s;ubject to the

drew them into the market place, unto the rulers&mdash;and
the multitude ro&s;e up together again&s;t them, and the magi|&s;trates
rent of their cloaths, and commanded to beat them.
And when they had laid many &s;tripes upon them they ca&s;t
them into pri&s;on, charging the Jaylor to keep them &s;afely.

<P>HERE we have an in&s;tance of a tumult rai&s;ed by
&s;ome &s;elf-intere&s;ted and de&s;igning men, the common
people incen&s;ed by their arguments, the magi&s;trates
drawn into an act of inju&s;tice. <HI>Petronius</HI> &s;eems to have
&s;u&s;pected, that the di&s;order at <HI>Doris</HI> had been commit|ted
with the connivance of the rulers there. It is not
at all unlikely, that the magi&s;trates of cities and towns,
who, po&s;&s;ibly, were but a few degrees above the com|mon
people, might &s;ometimes approve of the&s;e out|rages,
and act a part in them: but the Pre&s;idents and
Procon&s;uls, men of a larger Genius, who had been
educated at <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;erved offices there, who were
better acquainted with the Roman Con&s;titution, had a
greater charge, and were more immediately accounta|ble
to the Emperour and the Senate for the ob&s;ervation
of their edicts and the peace of the province, never,
or very rarely, entered into the&s;e mea&s;ures; but pu|ni&s;hed
&s;uch di&s;orderly practi&s;es when they happened,
and by fre&s;h precepts endeavoured to prevent them for
the future.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this act of the magi&s;trates at <HI>Philippi</HI>
was a &s;udden thing (<HI>they have beaten us openly uncon|demned</HI>). The order was given without a hearing;
and, as &s;oon as it was light the next morning, they
&s;ent their officers with directions, that the pri&s;oners
&s;hould be relea&s;ed. They &s;oon repented of what they
had done, and not with&s;tanding the &s;pecious preten&s;es
and obnoxious charges of the ma&s;ters of this dam&s;el,
that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> had <HI>taught cu&s;toms which were not
lawful for them to ob&s;erve;</HI> they were &s;en&s;ible they had
gone beyond their commi&s;&s;ion, and were apprehen&s;ive
of being called to an account by a higher Authority,
to which they were &s;ubject. This order of relea&s;e
was &s;ent, before they had heard that the&s;e men were
<PB N="238" REF="256">
<HI>Romans,</HI> and whil&s;t they knew no better than that
they were mere <HI>Jews,</HI> and defended by no other privi|leges
than tho&s;e that belonged to all of that nation.
And the hi&s;tory <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has given us of the fact at
<HI>Doris,</HI> and the conduct of the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria,</HI> up|on
occa&s;ion of it, may very well render every part of
this relation here highly probable. When the&s;e magi|&s;trates
knew that <HI>Paul</HI> and <HI>Silas</HI> were <HI>Romans,</HI> their
concern was &s;till encrea&s;ed; and their own intere&s;t
obliged them to all the farther conde&s;cen&s;ions, which
<HI>Paul</HI> demanded.</P>
<P>BUT to return to the cour&s;e of the narration.</P>
<P>THERE was another &s;ignal in&s;tance of the modera|tion
of <HI>Claudius</HI> to the <HI>Jews,</HI> which may not be pa&s;&s;ed
by. But before I produce it, I mu&s;t give &s;ome &s;hort
hi&s;tory of the ve&s;tment of the High Prie&s;t<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>, which
I &s;hall do in almo&s;t the very words of <HI>Jo&s;epbus;</HI> who
&s;ays, that <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, and his &s;on <HI>Archelaus</HI> had
this &s;acred ve&s;tment in their keeping, and lodged it
in the ca&s;tle <HI>Antonia;</HI> and that the Roman Procura|tors,
who &s;ucceeded to them in the government of
<HI>Judea,</HI> finding it there, kept the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it, till
<HI>Vitellius,</HI> Pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria,</HI> in the latter end of <HI>Tibe|rius</HI>'s
reign, gave it to the <HI>Jews</HI> to keep it them&s;elves.
The High Prie&s;t wore this garment four times only in
the year; at the three great Fea&s;ts, and on the day of the
Fa&s;t. It was delivered to him &s;even days before the&s;e
&s;ea&s;ons; and was fir&s;t purified before he put it on. The
next day after the&s;e &s;olemnities were over, it was re|turned
to the officer of the Che&s;t This was the me|thod,
whil&s;t it was kept by <HI>Herod</HI> and the Roman Go|vernours.
But, as was ju&s;t hinted above, <HI>Vitellius</HI> gave
it to the <HI>Jews,</HI> that they might lock it up ill a Che&s;t
of their own in the Temple, and take it out thence
for their u&s;e, without asking particular leave<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;. Ant. 18. c. 5. &sect;. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>BUT when <HI>Cu&s;pius Fadus</HI><NOTE N="F" PLACE="foot">A. D. 45.</NOTE> was Procurator of
<HI>Judea,</HI> he received orders from the Emperour, to
<PB N="239" REF="257">
take <HI>the holy garment which the High-Prie&s;t alone wears
into his own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. Jo&s;ephus</HI> does, immediately be|fore
this, mention a di&s;turbance which the <HI>Jews</HI> of
<HI>Paraea</HI> gave to &s;ome of their neighbours. He does
not &s;ay, that this irregular proceeding had brought
upon them this di&s;agreeable me&s;&s;age: Though it is

to him the Ve&s;tment of the High Prie&s;t, that it might
be lodged in the ca&s;tle of <HI>Antonia,</HI> as formerly.
They did not dare ab&s;olutely to refu&s;e: but they
earne&s;tly entreated <HI>Fadus,</HI> and <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius Longinus,</HI> Pre|&s;ident
of <HI>Syria,</HI> who was then likewi&s;e at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>&endq;
(and who was indeed come thither with forces on pur|po&s;e

&startq;that they would give them leave to &s;end am|ba&s;&s;adours

reque&s;t they complied.&endq; When the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> amba&s;&s;a|dors
came to <HI>Rome,</HI> they found there <HI>Agrippa</HI> the
younger, who &s;econded their petition. The Empe|rour
granted their petition, and &s;ent by them a letter
directed to the magi&s;trates of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the Senate,
People, and the whole nation of the <HI>Jews:</HI>&endq; in which
he &s;ays, &startq;<HI>Agrippa</HI>&mdash;having introduced to me your
amba&s;&s;adours, who thankfully acknowledged the

<PB N="240" REF="258">
Ve&s;tment and the Crown in your own keeping,
according as it had been allowed by the excellent
and my well beloved <HI>Vitellius,</HI> I have granted that
&s;o it &s;hould be. I have ratified this &s;encence, from
that principle of piety with which I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, and
becau&s;e I will that all men wor&s;hip [<HI>God</HI>] accord|ing
to the laws of their country<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ib. &sect;. 2.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS argument will be imperfect, if I do not &s;hew
&s;ome in&s;tance of this equity to the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the reign
of <HI>Nero.</HI> The only fact I &s;hall mention here, is this.
It happened in the time that <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> was Governour of
<HI>Judea</HI><NOTE N="G" PLACE="foot">A. D. 60. Ba&s;nage Ann. P. E. A. 60. n. 3.</NOTE>, who was the per&s;on who &s;ent <HI>Paul</HI> to <HI>Rome.
Agrippa</HI> the younger rai&s;ed the buildings of the hou&s;e,
in which he re&s;ided, when he was at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and
which had been the palace of the <HI>A&s;monaean</HI> Family:
by which he had not only a fine pro&s;pect of the City,
but likewi&s;e overlooked the inner court of the temple.
&startq;When the people of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;aw what he had
done, they were greatly incen&s;ed: for neither do
our cu&s;toms nor our laws permit, that any be&s;ide
the prie&s;ts &s;hould &s;ee what is done in the temple.
They therefore rai&s;ed a high wall at the extremity
of the we&s;t &s;ide of the inner court of the temple<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE>,
whereby they ob&s;tructed not only the king's view
[&s;c. <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s] out of his dining room, but al&s;o the
view from the we&s;tern portico without the Court,
where the <HI>Romans</HI> u&s;ed to keep gaurd on the fe&s;tival
days. <HI>Agrippa</HI> was exceedingly provoked at it, and
<HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> the Govenour yet more; and commanded
them to pull the wall down again. But they de&s;ired,
he would permit them to &s;end amba&s;&s;adours to <HI>Nero.
Fe&s;tus</HI> giving them leave, they deputed to <HI>Nero</HI> ten
of their chief men, and <HI>I&s;hmael</HI> the High Prie&s;t, and
<HI>Helchias</HI> the Keeper of the &s;acred trea&s;ury. <HI>Nero</HI>
<PB N="241" REF="259">
having given them an audience, not only forgave
what they had done, but allowed that the building
&s;hould remain<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. 20. c. 8. &sect;. 11.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS mu&s;t be acknowledged to be a remarkable
in&s;tance of goodne&s;&s;e. It &s;hews a great backward|ne&s;&s;e
in <HI>Nero,</HI> or tho&s;e who then governed him, to
break in upon their religion, or anything they e&s;teem|ed
&s;acred. This Palace of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and the Roman
Fort, &s;tood either directly we&s;t, or at le&s;t very near
we&s;t of the Temple. The entrance into the Temple
was at the ea&s;t end. So that they had no view from
the&s;e buildings into the Temple it&s;elf: only the high
ground they &s;tood upon, and the loftine&s;&s;e of the fa|brick
gave a view into the inner court, where the &s;a|crifices
were performed. And it being, as it &s;eems, in|con&s;i&s;tent
with their law, or at le&s;t with their cu&s;toms,
that their &s;acred acts &s;hould be overlooked by any but
the Prie&s;ts, the building that ob&s;tructed the view was
permitted by the Emperour to remain. I have alrea|dy
taken notice of the permi&s;&s;ion the Roman Govern|ment
had given the <HI>Jews,</HI> to kill any <HI>Gentile,</HI> though
a <HI>Roman,</HI> who entered beyond the bounds pre&s;cribed
to tho&s;e who were not <HI>Jews,</HI> and need not repeat it
here.</P>
<P>&sect;. V. I have now brought down my account of the
treatment, which the Roman Commonwealth and Em|pire
gave to the &s;everal religions which obtained in
the countries under their dominion, and particularly
to the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> religion, during the period I am con|cerned with. There are, in this &s;hort view, &s;everal
acts of goodne&s;&s;e and ju&s;tice done to the <HI>Jews</HI> by Pre|&s;idents
of provinces, be&s;ide the edicts and declarations
of the Senate, or the Emperours. But as the parti|culars
relating to this &s;ubject, mentioned in <HI>the Acts of
the Apo&s;tles,</HI> are chiefly in&s;tances of the conduct of Go|vernours
<PB N="242" REF="260">
of provinces, or of the officers next in autho|rity
under them, it will not be ami&s;s to add two or
three more te&s;timonies relating to the behaviour of
per&s;ons of the&s;e characters.</P>
<P>&startq;THERE happened likewi&s;e, <HI>&s;ays Jo&s;ephus,</HI> ano|ther
di&s;turbance at <HI>Ce&s;area</HI><NOTE N="H" PLACE="foot">A. D. 56. vid. Ba&s;nage Ann. Polit. Ecc.</NOTE>. The <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Sy|rians,</HI>
who lived there promi&s;cuou&s;ly, running both
into a &s;editious behaviour. For they would have it,
that the city was theirs, becau&s;e the founder of it,
<HI>Herod</HI> their King was a <HI>Jew.</HI> The&s;e allowed that
the founder indeed was a <HI>Jew,</HI> but they a&s;&s;erted, that
notwith&s;tanding that the city was the <HI>Greeks.</HI> For if
it had been given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> there would have
been no right of erecting &s;tatues and temples in it.
This point they di&s;puted one with another, till they
came to blows; and the more re&s;olute of each party
had daily skirmi&s;hes together. For the elders of the
<HI>Jews</HI> were not able to keep the &s;editious part of their
own people in order; and the <HI>Greeks</HI> were a&s;hamed
to yield to the <HI>Jews.</HI> The&s;e had the advantage in
point of wealth and &s;trength of body; but the <HI>Greeks</HI>
had the encouragement and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the &s;oldiers.
For the greate&s;t part of the Roman garri&s;on there
con&s;i&s;ting of men rai&s;ed in <HI>Syria,</HI> they were ready to
joyn with the <HI>Greeks</HI> as being their countrymen<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Caeterum militum. praefectis curae erat tu|multum coroprimere, &amp;c. Hud&s;on. Ver&s;.</NOTE>.
The officers however did their be&s;t to &s;uppre&s;s the&s;e
di&s;turbances, and from time to time &s;ei&s;ed the mo&s;t
factious of each &s;ide, and puni&s;hed them with &s;courg|ing
or impri&s;onment. But yet the &s;ufferings of tho&s;e
who were apprehended did very little re&s;train or ter|rifie
the re&s;t, for they were rather the more provoked
to be &s;editious. At length the <HI>Jews</HI> having had the
better in a combat, <HI>Felix</HI> coming into the market
place, required them to withdraw peaceably, threat|ning
<PB N="243" REF="261">
them &s;everely if they did not. They not obey|ing
him, he ordered his &s;oldiers in among&s;t them:
many were killed upon the &s;pot, who&s;e goods<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>
happened al&s;o to be plundered afterwards. The &s;e|dition
&s;till continuing there, he having &s;eleed &s;eve|ral
of the chief men of each body, &s;ent them to <HI>Nero,</HI>
that they might both lay their &s;everal preten&s;ions
before him<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. ii. c. 13. &s;in.</NOTE>.&quot;</P>
<P>THIS is the account which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> gives of this af|fair,
<HI>in the jewi&s;h war.</HI> In his <HI>Antiquities</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> lib. 20. c. 6. &sect;. 7.</NOTE>, a part
of this &s;tory &s;tands thus: &quot;At length they came to
throwing of &s;tones at each other. And many were
wounded on both &s;ides. The <HI>Jews</HI> however had the
victory. <HI>Felix</HI> then, perceiving this contention be|tween
them like to become a &s;ort of open war, came
out to them, and de&s;ired the <HI>Jews</HI> to give over.
They not obeying him, he gave his &s;oldiers orders
to take their arms, and fall upon them; and he &s;lew
a great many, took more pri&s;oners, and gave his
&s;oldiers leave to plunder &s;ome hou&s;es which were full
of trea&s;ure. But the more moderate, and the mo&s;t
eminent men of the <HI>Jews,</HI> being concerned for them|&s;eves,
as well as for their people, entreated <HI>Felix</HI> to
order his &s;oldiers to retreat, and to &s;pare the re&s;t,
and al&s;o to forgive what had pa&s;t. And <HI>Felix</HI> grant|ed
their reque&s;ts.&quot;</P>
<P>THESE pa&s;&s;ages of <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> de&s;erve the more to be
re&s;pected, becau&s;e they a&s;&s;ure us of the good mea&s;ures
taken by <HI>Felix,</HI> a per&s;on not much celebrated for the
<PB N="244" REF="262">
ju&s;tice of his admini&s;tration in other matters, and by
the chief officers under him, where they had concerns
with men of different religions: and that they did not
attempt to &s;ubvert the rights of either &s;ide, but only
endeavoured to keep the peace among them, as far as
they were able, at a &s;ea&s;on, in which the <HI>Jews</HI> were
extremely re&s;olute and tumultuous. And St. <HI>Paul</HI> re|ceived
&s;ome civilities from <HI>Felix,</HI> as well as from <HI>Ly&s;ias,</HI>
one of his principal officers.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> gives an account of a &s;edition rai&s;ed
by the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Alexandria</HI> about the time<NOTE N="I" PLACE="foot">An. D. 66.</NOTE> the war
broke out in <HI>Judea.</HI> Having mentioned the privileges
granted to the <HI>Jews</HI> there by <HI>Alexander</HI> the Great, he
&s;ays: &quot;And when the <HI>Romans</HI> became ma&s;ters of
<HI>Egypt,</HI> neither <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> the fir&s;t (of that name) nor any
of his &s;ucce&s;&s;ors would &s;uffer the honours conferred
upon them [<HI>the Jews</HI>] by <HI>Alexander</HI> to be dimini&s;hed.
There were however continual contentions between
them and the <HI>Greeks.</HI> And<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> THOUGH THE PRE|SIDENTS
DAILY PUNISHED MANY ON BOTH SIDES,
yet animo&s;ities encrea&s;ed. And as there were di&s;|turbances
at that time in other places, &s;o e&s;pecially
at <HI>Alexandria.</HI> The <HI>Alexandrians</HI> having called an
a&s;&s;embly to con&s;ider of the amba&s;&s;y they were about
to &s;end to <HI>Nero,</HI> a great many of the <HI>Jews</HI> came into
the amphitheatre and mixed them&s;elves with the
<HI>Greeks.</HI> When &s;ome of the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> perceived
them, they cried out, that there were enemies come
in among&s;t them to be &s;pies upon their debates;
and immediately laid hands upon &s;everal of them;
&s;ome others peri&s;hed, as they were getting out: and
three in particular, which had gotten out, were ta|ken
and brought back. The&s;e they threatned to
burn alive. Hereupon all the <HI>Jews</HI> in general
came to the re&s;cue of the&s;e men. They began with
throwing &s;tones at the <HI>Greeks:</HI> Then getting lighted
<PB N="245" REF="263">
torches they &s;urrounded the Amphitheatre, and
threatned to &s;et fire to it, and burn all the people
there to a man. So they would have done, if <HI>Tiberius
Alexander</HI> prefect of the city had not prevented them.
Though indeed he did not begin immediately with
ho&s;tilities. But &s;ending &s;ome per&s;ons of di&s;tinction
to them, advi&s;ed them to be peaceable, and not to
draw upon them&s;elves the Roman garri&s;on. But
the&s;e &s;editious people ridiculed the advice, and re|viled <HI>Tiberius.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>THE Pre&s;ident happened to have with him five
thou&s;and &s;oldiers, who had halted <HI>at Alexandria,</HI> in
their march from <HI>Libya</HI> into <HI>Judea,</HI> be&s;ide the two Le|gions
the u&s;ual garri&s;on there.</P>
<P><HI>TIBERIUS</HI> therefore ordered his &s;oldiers to their
arms. The <HI>Jews</HI> made a long defen&s;e, but when once
they were routed, there was a dreadful &s;laughter of
them: &startq;Fifty thou&s;and were killed. Nor would any
of them have been left alive, if they had not &s;ubmit|ted
and cried out for mercy. <HI>Alexander</HI> then taking
compa&s;&s;ion on them, ordered his &s;oldiers to de&s;i&s;t.
They being always trained to obedience, gave over
the &s;laughter at the very fir&s;t word of command.
But the <HI>Alexandrians</HI> being filled with inveterate ha|tred
were difficultly drawn off, and could &s;carce be
re&s;trained from in&s;ulting and abu&s;ing the dead bo|dies<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. ii. c. 18. &sect;. 7, 8.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS is indeed a long &s;tory. But the pa&s;&s;age con|taining
not only a character of the u&s;ual conduct of
the Pre&s;idents of <HI>Egypt,</HI> but giving us likewi&s;e an in|&s;tance
of a very great moderation, I was unwilling to
abridge it very much. I term it moderation: for &s;o
it &s;eems to me, for the Governour to &s;end amicable
advice to &s;o tumultuous a body of people, and warn
them of the con&s;equences of ob&s;tinacy, in&s;tead of com|ing
upon them with his forces, e&s;pecially when he
was &s;o well provided. And it was very honourable,
to accept the fir&s;t tenders of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="264">
I &s;hall give but one pa&s;&s;age more relating to this
matter. &startq;They [<HI>the Jews</HI>] received likewi&s;e, <HI>&s;ays
Jo&s;ephus,</HI> con&s;iderable honours from the Kings of
<HI>A&s;ia,</HI> becau&s;e they had &s;erved them in their wars. <HI>Se|leucus
Nicator</HI> gave them the privileges of citizens in
<HI>Antioch</HI> the Metropolis of his kingdome, which pri|vilege
they enjoy to this day. I need give no other
proof of it than this, that the <HI>Jews</HI> refu&s;ing to u&s;e
oyle prepared by other people, the <HI>Gymna&s;iarchs</HI><NOTE N="K" PLACE="foot">Officers that governed the places of exerci&s;e in the <HI>Greek</HI> cities.</NOTE>
give them a certain pre&s;cribed piece of money in&s;tead
of the oyle which &s;hould be allowed them<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE> And
when the people of <HI>Antioch,</HI> in the time of the late
war would have broke in upon this cu&s;tom, <HI>Mucianus,</HI>
then pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria</HI> obliged them to continue it,
And afterwards, when <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> and his &s;on <HI>Titus</HI>
were become Lords of the whole world, and the <HI>A|lexandrians</HI>
and <HI>Antiochians</HI> de&s;ired that the rights of
citizen&s;hip might be taken from the <HI>Jews,</HI> they would
not comply with their de&s;ire. From whence any may
perceive the equity and true greatne&s;&s;e<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> of the
<HI>Romans,</HI> and e&s;pecially of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> and <HI>Titus;</HI> who

war with the <HI>Jews,</HI> and had been very much offend|ed
with them, that they would not &s;ubmit them&s;elves
to them, but fought again&s;t them to the la&s;t as long
as they were able, yet they did not take away from
them the forementioned citizen&s;hip: But &s;o mode|rated

the <HI>Jews,</HI> and the entreaties of the <HI>Alexan|drians</HI>

as not to abrogate any part of the ancient
privileges given to the <HI>Jews,</HI> out of favour for tho&s;e
cities, or out of re&s;entment toward tho&s;e wicked
people whom they had vanqui&s;hed; &s;aying, That
they who had taken up arms again&s;t them, and had
<PB N="247" REF="265">
been &s;ubdued by them, had been &s;ufficiently puni&s;h|ed,
and that it would be unju&s;t to deprive tho&s;e of
their privileges who had committed no fault<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;. Ant. lib. xii. cap. 3. init.</NOTE>.&endq;
Here is one remarkable in&s;tance of <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nicene&s;&s;e,
and more than one example of the Roman genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>THESE are authentick te&s;timonies in behalf of the
equity of the Roman government in general, and of
the impartial admini&s;tration of Ju&s;tice by the Roman
Pre&s;idents toward all the people of their provinces,
how much &s;oever they differed from each other in mat|ters
of religion.</P>
<P>IT is undoubted, that many of the&s;e Pre&s;idents
were guilty of extortion, and other acts of inju&s;tice,
and endeavoured to enrich them&s;elves in the provinces.
But there &s;eems not to have been any one thing, which
the <HI>Romans</HI> were more concerned to pre&s;erve inviola|ble,
than the religion of all the people whom they con|quered;
judging, it is likely, that there is nothing
gives a people &s;o univer&s;al a di&s;gu&s;t, as injuries done
to their religion; and that therefore, the only way to
pre&s;erve peace throughout their empire, was to pro|tect
all men every where in the practi&s;e of their own
religious rites<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Quid hem! mediocrine tandem dolore cosaffectos e&s;&s;e arbitra|mini? non ita e&s;t, judices: primum quod omnes religione moventur:&amp; deos patrios quos a majoribus acceperunt, colendos &s;ibi diligenter &amp; retinendos c&s;&s;e arbitrantur.

<P>&sect;. VI. I imagine however, that the reader will be
apt to recollect here the &s;everal violations of things &s;a|cred,
which I have related to have been committed by
<HI>Verres</HI> in <HI>Sicilie;</HI> and he may be inclined to think that
&s;uch in&s;tances do very much weaken this argument.</P>
<P>BUT then, it ought to be remember'd likewi&s;e, that
the&s;e actions were very much cried out upon, and <HI>Ver|res</HI>
was called to an account for them. Be&s;ides, there
is no rea&s;on to believe there were many <HI>Verres.</HI> It
ought al&s;o to be con&s;idered, that <HI>Verres</HI> was Praetor of
<HI>Sicilie</HI> under the commonwealth, at a time when the
<PB N="248" REF="266">
courts of judicature at <HI>Rome,</HI> before whom complaints
from the provinces were brought, were extremely cor|rupt;
when ju&s;tice was admini&s;ter'd very &s;lowly, and
oftentimes not obtained at all. There are in <HI>Cicero</HI>
him&s;elf many acknowledgements of the bad &s;tate of
affairs at that time in this re&s;pect<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Spolia&s;ti Siculos. Solent enim $nulti e&s;&s;e in injuriis &s;uis pro|vinciales. Cic. in Verr. lib. iii. c. 41.

the provinces were much happier under the Empe|rours

that this puni&s;hment of <HI>Celer</HI> was the chief cau&s;e of

after he was taken into cu&s;tody, that I take it for
granted he was acted by &s;ome better principle. But
though this &s;avourable &s;uppo&s;ition be a piece of ju&s;tice
to <HI>Ly&s;ias,</HI> yet I make no doubt, but that this execu|tion
of <HI>Celer</HI> was a re&s;traint upon &s;ome people; and
that St. <HI>Paul</HI> and many others in <HI>Judea,</HI> and po&s;&s;ibly
in other provinces likewi&s;e, had &s;ome benefit by it.</P>
<P>I have, I hope, in this chapter, and other parts of
this work, given pa&s;&s;ages enough to enable every rea|der
to judge for him&s;elf in this point; and whereby he
may be a&s;&s;ured, the <HI>Jews</HI> enjoyed their religion in <HI>Ju|dea,</HI>
and out of it, without any very con&s;iderable mo|l&s;tations.
They had particularly, in <HI>Judea,</HI> their
High Prie&s;ts, frequented <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> at their great &s;eafts:
Images and other abominations were kept out of the
country, or, if they were brought in, they were &s;oon
carried back again.</P>
<P>NAY there appear, in the accounts I have given,
&s;everal po&s;itive proofs of an equal admini&s;tration of
ju&s;tice in divers parts, where injuries were offered;
and more might be given. A Roman &s;oldier in <HI>Judea</HI>
having rent and burnt a book of the lawes of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI>
the forementioned <HI>Cumanus,</HI> at the reque&s;t of the <HI>jews,</HI>
had him put<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 20. cap. 4. &sect;. 4. de B. J. 2. c. 12. &sect;. 2.</NOTE> to death. I believe, that mo&s;t will
allow, a capital puni&s;hment of a crime not particular|ly
&s;pecified, it is likely, in any law what&s;oever, to be
an act of compleat ju&s;tice at le&s;t.</P>
<P>&sect;. VII. IT will be needful however, in order fully
to clear up this matter, to &s;ubjoin two or three re|marks.</P>
<P>1. IT mu&s;t be owned, that according to the Roman
laws, no man might introduce any new Gods, or wor|&s;hip
<PB N="250" REF="268">
publickly or privately any &s;trange or foreign
Gods, not allowed of by publick authority<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Separatim nemo habe&s;&s;it deos neve novos: Sed ne advenas, ni&s;i public&egrave; ad&s;citos, privatim colunto. Cic. de legib. lib. ii. c. 8. init.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. BUT yet the di&s;ciples of Je&s;us Chri&s;t were under
the protection of the Roman laws, &s;ince the God whom
they wor&s;hiped, and who&s;e wor&s;hip they recommend|ed,
was the God of the heavens and the earrh, the
&s;ame God whom the <HI>Jews</HI> wor&s;hiped, and the wor&s;hip
of whom was allowed of all over the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI>
and e&s;tabli&s;hed by &s;pecial edicts and decrees in mo&s;t,
perhaps in all the places, in which we meet with St.
<HI>Paul</HI> in his travels.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> makes his defenfe be|fore
<HI>Felix</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI> upon this foot. <HI>They neither found
me in the temple di&s;puting with any man&mdash;</HI> But this I
confe&s;s to thee, that after the way which they call here&s;ie,
&s;o <HI>inor&s;hip</HI> I THE GOD OF MY FATHERS, <HI>Acts</HI> xxiv. 14.
They call this way a &s;ect; a new &s;ect; grant it to be
&s;o: But in this way I wor&s;hip the God of my fa|thers,
the &s;ame God which they do, and believe all
things which are written in the law and the prophets,
as firmly as any <HI>Jew</HI> whatever: Nor do I &s;ay any
thing incon&s;tent with them, or which I cannot &s;upport
by them: and therefore I am entitled to protection
equally with them, &s;ince I have not attempted nor ad|vi&s;ed
any di&s;turbance or in&s;urrection. This therefore
was a very ju&s;t and proper defen&s;e before <HI>Felix,</HI> a hea|then
magi&s;trate; and it was compleatly valid.</P>
<P>AND the Roman magi&s;trates out of <HI>Judea,</HI> and the
heathen people every where con&s;idered St. <HI>Paul</HI> and his
companions as <HI>Jews.</HI> It was &s;o evidently in <HI>Achaia.</HI>
The <HI>Jews</HI> brought <HI>Paul</HI> before the judgement Seat, <HI>&s;ay|ing,
this fellow per&s;wadeth men to wor&s;hip God contray to
the Law,</HI> Acts xviii. 1. But <HI>Gallio</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed that
<HI>Paul</HI> had as good a right to protection as them&s;elves,
and that the differences between <HI>Paul</HI> and them were
no other than &s;uch as might happen between men of
one and the &s;ame religion: and that the only rea&s;on,
<PB N="251" REF="269">
why <HI>Paul</HI> was brought before him was the envy, ma|lice,
and bigotry of &s;ome of the leading men among
the <HI>Jews</HI> of his province. <HI>If it be a que&s;tion of words
and names,</HI> &s;ays he, AND OF YOUR LAW, <HI>look ye to it,
for I will be no judge of &s;uch matters,</HI> ver. 15.</P>
<P>FROM whence, I think it appears, that <HI>Gallio</HI> was
not &s;o ignorant of the ca&s;e brought before him, as &s;ome
may be ready to imagine. If, <HI>&s;ays be,</HI> the matter in

doctrine, which, you &s;ay, <HI>Paul</HI> preaches; or of names,
whether Je&s;us may be called the Chri&s;t; (or perhaps
he means, of matters, about which the difference is
&s;o &s;mall that it is rather a controver&s;ie about names
than things): or of <HI>your law,</HI> whether it obliges all
men to be circumci&s;ed, who go over to the wor&s;hip of
your God, I will be no judge between you concerning
&s;uch matters.</P>
<P>IF the &s;en&s;e, I here give of the&s;e words, and parti|cularly
of <HI>your law,</HI> be right, it is an evidence, that
<HI>Gallio</HI> knew very well, that <HI>Paul</HI> had converted <HI>Hea|thens</HI>
to his &s;entiments; and yet he took no offen&s;e at
it: Only he was re&s;olved not to pa&s;&s;e any judicial &s;en|tence
upon the&s;e matters. And inded, I think it plain
from St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account, that <HI>Gallio</HI> had heard the
<HI>Jews</HI> tell their &s;tory out. But, when they had done,
he had more honour and good &s;en&s;e, than to oblige
<HI>Paul</HI> to make any apology for his principles in court,
under the character of a criminal or accu&s;ed per&s;on.</P>
<P>NOR is it at all &s;trange, that <HI>Gallio</HI> did not re&s;ent
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s converting men from Heatheni&s;m to the
wor&s;hip of the true God; &s;ince the <HI>Jews</HI> had done the

3. IT ought to be ob&s;erved, that the fir&s;t followers

do not perceive by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> that there were; I think,
there could not be any exceptions made to the propri|ety,
or decence of any of his expre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> has not recorded any of the di&s;cour&s;es made
by St. <HI>Paul,</HI> or tho&s;e who were with him, at <HI>Ephe&s;us.</HI>

of their words and actions there al&s;o. <HI>Ye have

multitude: If there had been any <HI>bla&s;phemies</HI> uttered
by <HI>the&s;e men,</HI> he had made them his own.</P>
<P>THE conduct, or expre&s;&s;e declarations of <HI>Felix,
Fe&s;tus, Agrippa,</HI> are te&s;timonies to the like unblameable
and inoffen&s;ive behaviour of St. <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI></P>
<P>I do not &s;ay, that according to laws &s;ince enacted in
&s;ome States, the Apo&s;tles would not have been judged
offenders. But it ought to be remember'd that the
<HI>Romans</HI> did for a long time as far &s;urpa&s;s many mo|dern
governments in the ju&s;tice and equity of their po|litical
maxims, as in the grandeur of their empire:
nor had they yet renounced or departed from them.</P>
<P>HAD there been any affront offered by <HI>Paul</HI> to the
<HI>jewi&s;h</HI> religion, either <HI>Felix</HI> or <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> would have di&s;co|vered
and puni&s;hed it. When &s;uch things were done
by <HI>Romans,</HI> they could not e&s;cape. Undoubtedly
therefore <HI>Paul</HI> had been as innocent in <HI>Judea,</HI> as he
had been out of it.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then, from the &s;everal particulars
here alledged, it mu&s;t appear highly probable, that

<P>THEY had no authority, by virtue of any edicts or

now for &s;ome while, from time to time, making pro|&s;elytes
of <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Syrians;</HI> converted them to the
wor&s;hip of the true God, the God whom the Chri&s;ti|ans
preached; and brought them, &s;ome indeed to part
only, others, to the ob&s;ervation of all the peculiar
rites of their religion. This they had done, and the
Pre&s;idents gave them no interruption or mole&s;tation.
Mu&s;t not then the&s;e officers have e&s;teemed it, as St.

envy and malice in the <HI>Jews</HI> to bring before them, and

than theirs had been?</P>

Roman government, to which all the world was then
&s;ubject, was &s;o mild and gentle, and protected all men

<P><HI>THUS St.</HI> Paul <HI>writes to the</HI> The&s;&s;alonians: Ye be|came
followers of the churches which in <HI>Judea</HI> are in

ii. 14. <HI>And St.</HI> Luke <HI>informs us, that at</HI> The&s;&s;aloni|ca,
the <HI>Jews</HI> which believed not, moved with envy, took

a company, and &s;et all the city on an uproar, and
a&s;&s;aulted the hou&s;e of <HI>Ja&s;on</HI>&mdash;Acts xvii. 5.</P>
<P><PB N="259" REF="277">
As according to St. <HI>Luke,</HI> they were the <HI>Jews,</HI> who
u&s;ually began, or aggravated the di&s;turbances again&s;t
<HI>Paul;</HI> &s;o <HI>Paul</HI> him&s;elf a&s;cribes his own &s;ufferings, and
tho&s;e of others likewi&s;e, to the <HI>Jews.</HI> Thus it follows
in the place ju&s;t now cited from him: <HI>who both killed
the Lord Je&s;us and their own prophets, and have per per&s;ecu|ted
us; and they plea&s;e not God, and are contrary to all
men: forbidding us to &s;peak unto the</HI> Gentiles <HI>that they
may be &s;aved,</HI> 1 The&s;&s;. ii. 15, 16. And to the <HI>Galatians</HI>
he &s;ays, <HI>And I, brethren, if I yet preach circumci&s;ion,
why do I yet &s;uffer per&s;ecution? Then is the offence of the
Cro&s;s cea&s;ed,</HI> Gal. iv. II, From which words it is plain,
that all the Apo&s;tle's &s;ufferings came from the bigot|ted
<HI>Jews;</HI> and that, if it had not been for them, he
might have preached the go&s;pel quietly enough.</P>
<P>THOUGH the <HI>Romans</HI> were ma&s;ters of the world,
and were governed by the&s;e moderate maxims, as I
have &s;hewn; yet the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians might be expo&s;ed
to many hard&s;hips and &s;ufferings, as they certainly
were. The &s;ources of them are very evident. There
was a heavy perfecution in <HI>Judea,</HI> which commenced
not long after our Saviour's a&s;cen&s;ion, and la&s;ted, pro|bably,
&s;everal Years. The <HI>Jews</HI> had a right to call
men before the council, could excommunicate men
out of their &s;ynagogues, &s;courge, and beat them; they
could bring men before the Governour and pro&s;ecute
for capital crimes. Doubtle&s;s they exerted all the pow|er
they had again&s;t the believers, and did other things
they had no right to do, partly through connivance,
it is likely, of the Governour, and partly, perhaps,
becau&s;e he could not hinder them. Then <HI>Herod Agrip|pa</HI>
was King of <HI>Judea</HI> three years and more, and he,
out of his own aver&s;ion to Chri&s;tianity, and to plea&s;e
the <HI>Jews,</HI> was an inveterate enemy of the followers of
Je&s;us. And after this, when <HI>Judea</HI> was again put un|der
Roman Procurators, be&s;ide the le&s;&s;er puni&s;hments
the <HI>Jews</HI> could inflict them&s;elves, they could pro&s;ecute
before the Procurators, as they did <HI>Paul.</HI> And we
find, that though <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> were both convinced
<PB N="260" REF="278">
of his innocence; yet they did, neither of them, dare
to relea&s;e him again&s;t the inclinations of the people of
their province. And &s;uch was the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> influence in
this cau&s;e, that by their means <HI>Paul</HI> was kept two
years in pri&s;on in <HI>Judea,</HI> and as many afterwards at
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>As for the Sufferings which the Chri&s;tians were lia|ble
to out of <HI>Judea;</HI> every one mu&s;t be &s;en&s;ible, that
where-ever <HI>Paul,</HI> or any other made any con&s;iderable
number of converts among the <HI>Heathen,</HI> many of the
common people were provoked, and would be apt to
in&s;ult them; and, in &s;ome places, the inferior magi|&s;trates
might be &s;o weak as to concur with them, <HI>Acts</HI>
xvi. 22. Be&s;ides, the <HI>Jews</HI> were numerous every
where, throughout the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> When <HI>Paul</HI>
was at <HI>Ly&s;tra, there came thither certain</HI> Jews <HI>from</HI> An|tioch
<HI>and</HI> Iconium, <HI>who per&s;waded the people; and ha|ving
&s;toned</HI> Paul, <HI>drew him out of the City: &s;uppo&s;ing he
had been dead,</HI> Ch. xiv. 19. How <HI>the</HI> Jews <HI>of</HI> The&s;&s;a|lonica,
[<HI>Ch.</HI> xvii. 5.] behaved, we have &s;een ju&s;t now.
The&s;e very &s;ame <HI>Jews</HI> of <HI>The&s;&s;alonica</HI> followed <HI>Paul</HI>
and <HI>Silas</HI> to <HI>Beraea, and &s;tirred up the people,</HI> ver. 13.
In <HI>Achaia, the</HI> Jews <HI>made in&s;urrection again&s;t</HI> Paul, <HI>and
brought him before the judgment &s;eat,</HI> Ch. xviii. 14. At
<HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> they would have heightened the rage of the
people, though <HI>the whole City was,</HI> before, <HI>filled with
confu&s;ion,</HI> Ch. xix. 33. When this <HI>uproar was cea&s;ed,
and</HI> Paul <HI>was about to &s;ail into</HI> Syria, <HI>the</HI> Jews <HI>laid wait
for him,</HI> Ch. xxi. 1&mdash;3.</P>
<P>NOR ought it to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that the <HI>Jews</HI> were
incon&s;iderable enemies. The malicious, however un|furni&s;hed,
will always find &s;ome weapons; and rage
makes men, for a time at le&s;t, &s;trong and terrible. We
&s;ee a great deal of enmity again&s;t the fir&s;t followers of
Je&s;us in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;peeches and proceedings in <HI>Judea</HI>
and other parts. But perhaps it is not ea&s;y to form a
compleat idea of it. What vexation mu&s;t it not have
given to the generality of this people, who were now
in full expectation of &s;ubduing the whole world to
<PB N="261" REF="279">
them&s;elves, to &s;ee a number of men of their own na|tion
travelling over the <HI>Roman Empire,</HI> teaching that
Je&s;us, who had been crucified, was the Me&s;&s;iah,
the great King and Deliverer that had been promi|&s;ed
to the <HI>Jews;</HI> inviting <HI>Gentiles</HI> al&s;o to the parti|cipation
of all the privileges of the people of God,
without in&s;i&s;ting on circumci&s;ion or other rites of
their law!</P>
<P>THE peculiar principles, temper, and di&s;po&s;ition
of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> people de&s;erve to be &s;omewhat farther
con&s;idered in this place. The&s;e were &s;uch, that tho'
the Roman Governours had taken the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians
into their &s;pecial protection, they could not have &s;e|cured them from all injuries. The <HI>Jews</HI> then not on|ly
&s;corned &s;ubjection and obedience to others, and af|fected
liberty and independence, but they expected do|minion
over all mankind. This we may perceive from
divers characters and admonitions in the <HI>New Te&s;ta|ment,</HI>
and from the writings of <HI>Jo&s;epbus. They de&s;pi&s;e

it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed unlikely, that they &s;hould at|tempt

<P>THESE di&s;couragements and &s;ufferings then the

&s;ynagogues, excommunications from the ordinary

find it no hard matter to augment the prejudices, both
of <HI>Jews</HI> and <HI>Gentiles,</HI> again&s;t a &s;ingular &s;et of men.</P>
<P>IT maybe, I think, rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;ed, that the
&s;ufferings of the followers of Je&s;us, in the period we
are now concerned with, were not equal to tho&s;e,
<PB N="264" REF="282">
which they were afterward expo&s;ed to, when the Ro|man
Emperours treated them? as public enemies, an|thorized
their officers every where to puni&s;h them, and
countenanced the common people in tho&s;e abu&s;es and
outrages they were di&s;po&s;ed to of them&s;elves. Much
le&s;s did they equal the torments which good men
have undergone, &s;ince men of the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite ma|lice
and &s;ubtilty, in &s;everal ages, have improved per|&s;ecution
into a &s;cience, and devoted them&s;elves to this
work as their &s;olemn bu&s;ine&s;&s;e and profe&s;&s;ion; till at
length they have compleated this wor&s;t of all inven|tions,
and with a dexterity truly diabolical have at
once increa&s;ed the fatigue of the &s;ufferer, and abated
the horrour and companion of all heedle&s;s and incon&s;i|derate
&s;pectators. The&s;e things perhaps may, but
the&s;e only could make us think the difficulties, dan|gers,
and &s;ufferings of the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians, &s;mall.</P>
<P>BUT yet after all, if we duly con&s;ider the va&s;t &s;en|&s;ibility
of human nature to pain and di&s;grace, I believe
it will be allowed, that the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence and growth of
Chri&s;tianity under the di&s;couragements it met with in
its very infancy, at a time when there had been but
few examples of patience and con&s;tance under &s;uffer|ings
in any ca&s;e that bears any near re&s;emblance with
this, are a &s;trong argument in favour of its divine
original: and a proof, that they, who then embraced
it, and were &s;teady in the profe&s;&s;ion of it, were,
upon the be&s;t evidences, fully per&s;waded of the facts
on which it depends; and were animated by the hopes
of that great reward, which is one di&s;tingui&s;hed article
of the Chri&s;tian doctrine.</P>

<P><HI>CESTIUS,</HI> ju&s;t now mentioned, Pre&s;ident of

<PB N="268" REF="286">

<P>THE concluding &s;entence of this pa&s;&s;age is a proof,
that &s;ome &s;trangers, <HI>Greeks,</HI> as St. <HI>John</HI> [Ch. xii. 20.]

are the per&s;ons, who are called <HI>devout men,</HI> and <HI>men
that fear</HI> God. They are al&s;o termed Pro&s;elytes of
the Gate. If they had been Pro&s;elytes of righteou&s;|ne&s;&s;e,
that is, circumci&s;ed; they would have had a
right to eat of the Pa&s;&s;over. For &s;o was the law:

ob&s;erved, this number does mightily corre&s;pond with
the abovementioned computation; for if the num|ber
of tho&s;e who were clean was 2700000, it is ea&s;y
to conclude, that, if the unclean be added to this

&startq;<HI>Alexandra</HI> was at that time at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and having

endeavoured to get the two forts, which are in the

upon the city, as the other is upon the temple) for

without the&s;e they cannot come to offer &s;acrifices.

<P>&sect;. III. WE had ju&s;t now mention made of the

When the Di&s;ciples had been filled with the Holy
Gho&s;t, after our Saviour's a&s;cen&s;ion, and &s;pake with
divers tongues, there was a reflexion ca&s;t upon them:
<HI>Others mocking, &s;aid, the&s;e men are full of new wine,</HI>
Acts ii. 13. St. <HI>Peter</HI> confutes them in this manner:

to attend their morning prayer, fa&s;ting.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> &s;ays: &startq;Twice every day, in the

then were the two hours of performing &s;acrifices at
the temple: and it is likely, that a great number of
devout <HI>Jews</HI> who lived at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> u&s;ually went up
to the temple at tho&s;e hours.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. THE <HI>Jews</HI> are repre&s;ented to have had a
very high veneration for the temple, as not able to
hear any thing &s;aid of it, that was not honourable;
and as &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve it from every thing which
they thought a pollution of it. <HI>And &s;et up fal&s;e wintene&s;|&s;es,

all men every where again&s;t the people, and the
law, and</HI> THIS PLACE. <HI>And farther, brought</HI> Greeks
<HI>into the temple, and hath polluted this</HI> HOLY PLACE. <HI>Ch.</HI>
xxi. 28, 29.</P>
<P>I have already given in this work, from <HI>Philo</HI> and
<HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> many evidences of the veneration, the <HI>Jews</HI>
of this time had for the Temple. I add here one
pa&s;&s;age more from <HI>Philo,</HI> in which the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> re&s;olution
to pre&s;erve the purity of the temple is repre&s;ented by
him in the &s;tronge&s;t terms that can be u&s;ed. &startq;One
thing, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> we de&s;ire in&s;tead of all others, that
no novelty be introduced into the temple, but that
it be pre&s;erred &s;uch as we have received it from our
forefathers. If we cannot obtain this, we yield up
<PB N="271" REF="289">
our &s;elves to be de&s;troyed, that we may not live to
&s;ee a greater evil than death<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ev <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> de leg. p. 1025. E.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t pur&s;ue the &s;tory of the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ei&s;ing St. <HI>Paul</HI>
at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> though it was tran&s;cribed above upon a|nother
occa&s;ion. <HI>And all the city was moved, and the
people ran together: and they took</HI> Paul, <HI>and drew him
out of the temple.&mdash;And as they went to kill him, tidings
came to the chief captain of the band, that all</HI> Jeru&s;alem
<HI>was in an uproar,</HI> &amp;c. Ch. xxi. 30&mdash;32.</P>
<P>A &s;oldier, of the Roman guard at the temple, had
been guilty of a very indecent action there, and vent|ed
&s;ome rude expre&s;&s;ions in the hearing of the <HI>Jews.</HI>
&startq;At this the whole multitude was moved with indig|nation,
and cried out, that <HI>Cumanus</HI> ought to puni&s;h
the &s;oldier. But &s;ome young people, and others
with them of a warm di&s;po&s;ition, immediately made
a tumult, and began to throw &s;tones at the &s;oldiers.
<HI>Cumanus</HI> fearing le&s;t all the people &s;hould make an
a&s;&s;ault upon him, &s;ent for more &s;oldiers. When
they had potted them&s;elves in the porticoes, the
<HI>Jews</HI> were thrown into a prodigious fright, and fled
from the temple into the city. So great was the
croud in the pa&s;&s;ages, that ten thou&s;and were pre&s;&s;ed
or trod to death<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">De B. J. lib. ii. cap. 12. &sect;. 1.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE two ca&s;es have this difference, that in the
latter there had been a manife&s;t affront offered to the
temple; but in the former, they only &s;uppo&s;ed there
had been one. For the re&s;t, there is a great agree|ment:
the temper of the people is much the &s;ame,
and they were for immediately doing them&s;elves ju|&s;tice:
and a &s;trong body of &s;oldiers is brought to keep
the peace.</P>
<P>&sect; V. THE <HI>Jews</HI> great re&s;pect for the law appears
in &s;ome texts already tran&s;cribed in this chapter, and
<PB N="272" REF="290">
in many other places of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI> &s;ome of
which cannot but occur to the reader's thoughts.</P>
<P>NOT long after the ju&s;t mentioned in&s;olence at the
temple, &startq;A &s;oldier having found the &s;acred law in a
certain village, tore the book to pieces, and threw it
into the fire. The <HI>Jews</HI> were hereupon no le&s;s a&s;to|ni&s;hed
than if the whole country had been in flames;
and all with one accord out of concern for their re|ligion,
as if moved by one common &s;pring, flocked
to <HI>Cumanus</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">A. ibid. &sect;. 2.</NOTE> at <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI> and intreated him, that
the man, who had offered this affront to God and
the law, might not go unpuni&s;hed. He perceiving
the multitude was not to be appea&s;ed, unle&s;&s;e &s;ome
&s;atisfaction were given them, ordered the &s;oldier to
be brought forth, and to be had through the croud
of his accu&s;ers, and put to death.&endq;</P>

and the regard expre&s;&s;ed for the temple it&s;elf
and the law, we have in the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> frequent
mention of the <HI>Synagogue wor&s;hip. And he</HI> [Je&s;us] <HI>came

Nor did he appoint, that it &s;hould be

brought an earthen ve&s;&s;el, and having placed
it with the bottom uppermo&s;t, &s;acrificed birds, as

<P><HI>CAPPELLUS</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Spiceleg. in Act. Apo&s;t. xxi. 23.</NOTE> indeed does make a doubt,
whether the vow of the four men in the <HI>Acts,</HI> or of
<HI>Bernice</HI> in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> be the vow of the <HI>Nazarite.</HI> But
I &s;ee no good rea&s;on for this doubt. However he al|lows
theirs and <HI>Bernice's</HI> vow to have been of one and
the &s;ame nature.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> &s;ays, it was a cu&s;tom to make a
vow of <HI>thirty days.</HI> There is no particular time pre|&s;cribed
for the vow of the <HI>Nazarile</HI> in the law of <HI>Mo|&s;es.</HI>
And it is my opinion, that the only rea&s;on of <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>'s
<PB N="276" REF="294">
mentioning this particular number here, was,
becau&s;e this happened to be the term of <HI>Bernice</HI>'s vow,
of which he had occa&s;ion to &s;peak.</P>
<P>THERE may be a difficulty rai&s;ed with reference
to St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s vow at <HI>Cenchrea:</HI> becau&s;e the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> wri|ters
&s;ay, that a <HI>Nazarite</HI> ought not to be out of the
land of <HI>I&s;rael;</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Nec licebat Naziraeo e&s;&s;e extra terram I&s;raeliticam. Nazir. iii. 6. Reland. ubi &s;upra, p. 277.</NOTE> and in the law of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> it is &s;aid:
<HI>the</HI> Nazarite <HI>&s;hall &s;have the head of his &s;eparation, at the
door of the tabernacle of the congregation,</HI> Numb. vi. 18.
This is &s;ome difficulty: but I am very much inclined
to think, that notwith&s;tanding all their zeal, they did
at this time di&s;pen&s;e with the exactne&s;&s;e of many things
required in the law of <HI>Mo&s;es.</HI> It &s;eems to be the ne|ce&s;&s;ary
con&s;equence of their living, as there now did
great numbers of them, at a va&s;t di&s;tance from <HI>Jeru|&s;alem.</HI>
Was there any law more expre&s;s than this:
<HI>Three times in a year &s;hall all thy males appear before the
Lord thy God in the place that he &s;hall choo&s;e,</HI> Deut. xvi.
16. Exod. xxiii. 17. But this they could not do who
lived in <HI>Italie</HI> or <HI>Per&s;ia.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, it &s;eems there is a rule in the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
books, <HI>that they who make the vow of the</HI> Nazarite <HI>out
of the land of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>&s;hall go into it to compleat the</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Si quis vovi&s;&s;et Nazi|reatum extra terrain, pro&s;ici&s;ci debuit in terram, &amp; illic votum im|plere. Eduioth iv. 11. apud Reland. ubi &s;upra.</NOTE> <HI>vow.</HI>
This will go a great way towards &s;olving the difficulty,
if it will but be allowed, that this was the rea&s;on of
St <HI>Paul</HI>'s great concern to <HI>keep the next fea&s;t at Jeru|lem.</HI>
Thus St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account &s;tands. After <HI>Paul</HI>
was come to <HI>Corinth.&mdash;Then &s;pake the Lord to</HI> Paul <HI>in
the night by a vi&s;ion, Be not afraid, but &s;peak and hold
not thy peace. For I am with thee; and no man &s;hall &s;et
on thee to hurt thee.&mdash;And when</HI> Gallio <HI>was the deputy
of</HI> Achaia, <HI>the</HI> Jews <HI>made in&s;urrection with one accord
again&s;t</HI> Paul; <HI>and brought him to the judgment &s;eat.</HI>
Paul was now in a great danger and was delivered.
<HI>And</HI> Paul <HI>after this, tarried there yet a good while, and
<PB N="277" REF="295">
then took his leave of the brethren, and &s;ailed thence into</HI>
Syria, <HI>and with him</HI> Pri&s;cilla <HI>and</HI> Aquila, <HI>having &s;horn
his head in</HI> Cenchrea: <HI>for he had a vow. And he came
to</HI> Ephe&s;us, <HI>and left them there: but he him&s;elf entered
into the Synagogue, and rea&s;oned with the</HI> Jews. <HI>When
they de&s;ired him to &s;tay longer time with them he con&s;ented
not: but bade them farewel, &s;aying, I mu&s;t by all means
keep this fea&s;t that cometh</HI> IN JERUSALEM.&mdash;<HI>And he &s;ail|ed
from</HI> Ephe&s;us. <HI>And when he had landed at</HI> Ce&s;area,
<HI>and gone up and &s;aluted the church, he went down to</HI> An|tioch,
<HI>Acts</HI> xviii. 9&mdash;22.</P>
<P>THERE is nothing in this relation, that contra|dicts
the &s;uppo&s;ition, that St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s vow was the occa|&s;ion
of his going to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> at this time: or in other
words, that he went thither to compleat his vow and
offer the appointed Sacrifices; but there is a great deal
to countenance it. The Lord had appeared to <HI>Paul,</HI>
and promi&s;ed to &s;tand by him. <HI>Paul</HI> had actually
been in a great danger, and received a very &s;ignal de|liverance.
It is likely, that at this &s;ea&s;on, or &s;oon af|ter,
he made a vow: and perhaps had made the en|gagement
to take the vow, when the Lord appeared
to him.</P>
<P>THE account of his &s;etting out from <HI>Corinth,</HI> and
going to <HI>Syria</HI> begins with the mention of the vow;
and <HI>Paul</HI> makes all po&s;&s;ible expedition to get to <HI>Jeru|&s;alem.</HI>
When he comes thither he makes no long
&s;tay: And the <HI>&s;aluting the church</HI> could not be the
principal end of this journey, for <HI>that</HI> imports no
more than a compliment of civility. St. <HI>Luke,</HI> it is
true, does not mention expre&s;&s;ly any thing, which
<HI>Paul</HI> did at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> be&s;ide &s;aluting the church:
But there was no nece&s;&s;ity he &s;hould. The occa&s;ion of
his going thither appears in the beginning of the ac|count.
And it is likely, that this was then &s;o well
under&s;tood, that he could not be more particular with|out
an unnece&s;&s;ary repetition. Throw away this de|&s;ign,
and St. <HI>Luke</HI> has been guilty of a very great
omi&s;&s;ion: and, though <HI>Paul</HI> was in great ha&s;te to get
<PB N="278" REF="296">
to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> there is no hint at all, what was aimed
at in the journey. Take in this de&s;ign, and then we
have here a compleat &s;tory.</P>
<P>IT is true, St. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;ays: <HI>I mu&s;t by all means keep</HI>
THIS FEAST <HI>that cometh in</HI> Jeru&s;alem. But the fea&s;t
time was not the only rea&s;on, becau&s;e <HI>Paul</HI> did not
keep every fea&s;t there. There was &s;ome particular in|ducement
to this fea&s;t; which &s;eems to me to be this:
St. <HI>Paul</HI> was obliged, on the account of his vow, to
go to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> about this time. And, a fea&s;t then
approaching, it was certainly mod eligible to be there
at that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>I have taken no notice of <HI>Grotius</HI>'s<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">In Act. xviii. 18.</NOTE> opinion, who
thought it was <HI>Aquila,</HI> and not <HI>Paul,</HI> who had this
vow at <HI>Cenchrea:</HI> becau&s;e, though there may be &s;ome
ambiguity in the words them&s;elves; yet the whole
thread of St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s narration renders it much more
probable, if not certain, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> is the per&s;on
&s;poken of. And learned men &s;eem to be generally
convinced of it<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Whitby in loc. Cleric. Hi&s;t. Ecc.

<P>THE <HI>vow at Cenchrea,</HI> whether <HI>Paul</HI>'s or <HI>Aquila</HI>'s
and <HI>the four men</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem who had a vow,</HI> are an
argument that this piece of devotion was not uncom|mon
among the <HI>Jews</HI> at this time. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has a&s;&s;u|red
us expre&s;ly it was not. But there is &s;omething very
particular in the advice given to <HI>Paul,</HI> namely, that
he <HI>&s;hould take the&s;e men and be at charges with them that
they may</HI> SHAVE THEIR HEADS, <HI>Acts</HI> xxi. 24.<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> This
may incline us to &s;uppo&s;e, that it was an u&s;ual thing
now, for zealous men, who had it in their power, to
bear the whole, or at le&s;t a part of the charges, which
a <HI>Nazarite</HI> was to be at, when his vow was expired.
It &s;eems to have been a pretty heavy offering which
was required of them. Perhaps this might give ri&s;e to
this cu&s;tom: But whatever was the rea&s;on of it, it ap|pears
to have been a common practice.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="297">
THE Emperour <HI>Claudius,</HI> in the beginning of his

he (<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays) as it was very likely for one to
do, who had had &s;o con&s;iderable an advancement,
made all the expedition he could into his kingdome;
and coming to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> he offered up &s;acrifices of
thank&s;giving, and omitted nothing that was pre&s;cri|bed

not &s;ay,&mdash;<HI>Be at charges with them,</HI> that they may per|form

this was the common phra&s;e among the <HI>Jews</HI> at this
time.</P>
<P>WE &s;ee likewi&s;e, how very proper this advice gi|ven
by the brethren was to an&s;wer the purpo&s;e, for
which it was intended. It &s;eems to have been a popu|lar
action. It was one of tho&s;e things by which <HI>Agrip|pa</HI>

Jews <HI>which were of A&s;ia &s;tirred up all the people, and laid
hands on him.&mdash;And as they were about to</HI> KILL <HI>him, ti|dings
came unto the chief captain of the band, that all</HI> Je|ru&s;alem
<HI>was in an uproar,</HI> Ch. xxi. 27&mdash;31.</P>
<P>THE next day after this popular tumult, that the
chief captain <HI>might how the certainty, wherefore he was

together,</HI> and had <HI>Paul</HI> examined before them. But, a
di&s;&s;en&s;ion ari&s;ing among&s;t them, he took <HI>Paul</HI> from
them and brought him again into the Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> ob&s;erving this, and finding they were
not like to obtain a &s;entence with the expedition they
wi&s;hed for; and fearing po&s;&s;ibly, they &s;hould never

which had made this con&s;piracy. And they came to the

<P>HERE are forty men, who enter into a con&s;piracy
to take away <HI>Paul</HI>'s life in a clande&s;tine manner; and
they make no &s;cruple to declare it to the council, re|lying
upon their approbation. And it is plainly impli|el,
that <HI>they</HI> entered readily into the mea&s;ures they
were to take for the accompli&s;hing this vile de&s;ign.</P>
<P><PB N="281" REF="299">
THEY were now di&s;appointed by the vigilance of

But no &s;ooner was <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> come into the province, but
they renew the &s;ame de&s;ign. And, it is likely, they
hoped to have &s;urprized their new Governour. It was
very fit, he &s;hould be gracious at his fir&s;t arrival; and
how could he &s;u&s;pect any harm, who was as yet a

<HI>to</HI> Jeru&s;alem. <HI>Then the</HI> HIGH PRIEST AND THE CHIEF
OF THE JEWS <HI>informed him again&s;t</HI> Paul, <HI>and be&s;ought

<P>IF we had remaining any con&s;iderable number of

might ju&s;tly expect, (if we have a true repre&s;entation
of the&s;e facts) to find in them &s;ome traces of a princi|ple,
that might produce &s;uch a behaviour, and po&s;&s;i|bly,
&s;ome examples re&s;embling tho&s;e here related.
And though we have but very few of their writers
come down to us, yet we have authentic evidences of
a principle, which obtained among&s;t them at this time,
and which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have carried them into the
conduct here de&s;cribed.</P>
<P>WE have this principle laid down in <HI>Philo:</HI> He is
&s;peaking of what may be done toward a <HI>Jew</HI> that for|&s;akes
the wor&s;hip of the true God. &startq;And<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">K <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Philo. de Monarch. lib. i. p. 818. D. E.</NOTE> it is
highly proper, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> that all, who have a zeal for
virtue, &s;hould have a right to puni&s;h with their own
hands without delay tho&s;e who are guilty of this
<PB N="282" REF="300">
crime; not carrying them before a court of Judica|ture,
or the council, or any magi&s;trate what&s;oever;
but to indulge the abhorrence of evil, the love of
God their minds are filled with, in the immediate
puni&s;hment of the&s;e impious wretches; reckoning
that they are for that time all things, Senators,
Judges, Praetors, Sergeants, accu&s;ers, witne&s;&s;es,
the laws, the people; that nothing hindering, they
may without fear e&s;pou&s;e the cau&s;e of piety.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>PHILO</HI> here recommends this conduct toward
tho&s;e that for&s;ake the true God, and he after this illu|&s;trates
his principle from the example of <HI>Phineas,</HI>
Numb. xxv. 7.</P>
<P>LET us next &s;ee, how <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;peaks concerning
this point. When he has given the abridgement of the
Laws of <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> he &s;ays, that <HI>Mo&s;es</HI> having delivered
them, &startq;called together the people with their wives
and their children, their &s;laves being pre&s;ent like|wi&s;e:
and adjured them to ob&s;erve his Laws.&mdash;and
that if any one of their kindred, or if any City &s;hould
attempt to alter or di&s;&s;olve the form of government
they were under, they &s;hould both jointly and &s;ing|ly
[or <HI>publickly and privately</HI>] take vengeance of
them<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">eos &amp; publlic&egrave; &amp; privatim ulci&s;cerentur. Hud&s;. ver&s;. Antiq. 4. c. 8. &sect;. 45.</NOTE>.&mdash;And if they were not able to take pu|ni&s;hment
of them, they &s;hould however make it
appear, that &s;uch things had not been done with
their content. And the multitude &s;wore &s;o to do.</P>
<P>ONE would think from what <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> here &s;ays,
that they under&s;tood this obligation to extend not on|ly
to the ca&s;e of idolatry, but to every breach of their
laws. If they did &s;o, it mu&s;t have occa&s;ioned many
extravagant attempts at this time; when, by means of
the Roman Power, they were unable, in the way of
legal proce&s;&s;es, to gratify their zeal; which, it is
certain, ran very high at this time.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="301">
WHAT <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays is the more to be regarded,
in that the&s;e books of his <HI>jewi&s;h Antiquities</HI> were pro|fe&s;&s;edly
written by him for the information of the
<HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Romans.</HI> And therefore it cannot be &s;up|po&s;ed,
he would give a more offen&s;ive view of this
tran&s;action than was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to &s;atisfy the
<HI>Jews</HI> of tho&s;e times, who might happen to &s;ee his per|formance.</P>
<P>BESIDE the di&s;covery the&s;e two writers have made
of the principle it&s;elf, there is in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> a &s;tory of a
con&s;piracy again&s;t <HI>Herod,</HI> which may not be omitted.</P>
<P>&startq;Now <HI>Herod</HI> deviated more and more from our
ancient cu&s;toms, and by foreign inventions corrupted
our con&s;titution which is inviolable.&mdash;He in&s;tituted
<HI>Quinquennial</HI> Games in honour of <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> and built a
Theatre at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI>&mdash;The magnificence of the&s;e
works was admired by foreigners, but to the <HI>Jews</HI>
the&s;e things appeared to be a breach upon tho&s;e
laws which they highly re&s;pected.&mdash;But nothing
di&s;gu&s;ted them &s;o much, as the trophies. Suppo&s;ing
there were images under the arms, they were en|raged
at the &s;ight of them, it being contrary to our
Law to wor&s;hip any images.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;<HI>Herod</HI> knew very well how much they were pro|voked.
But did not think it a proper opportunity
to u&s;e violence. Wherefore he endeavoured to ap|pea&s;e
them by fair words: but in vain. For with
one con&s;ent they cried out, that they would &s;uffer
any extremity rather than have images of men in
their city.&mdash;Whereupon, <HI>Herod</HI> took &s;ome of their
chief men into the theatre; and having ordered the
ornaments to be taken off, when nothing appeared
underneath but a naked piece of wood, the compa|ny
&s;miled at the mi&s;take.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The people &s;eemed upon this to be brought into a
better temper.&mdash;But yet &s;ome there were, who &s;till
retained the offen&s;e they had taken at the&s;e practi&s;es:
and e&s;teeming the alteration of their laws to be the
beginning of all manner of evils,&mdash;thought it their
<PB N="284" REF="302">
duty to run any hazard, rather than to &s;eem to con|nive
at <HI>Herod,</HI> who was forcibly introducing things
contrary to their cu&s;toms, and who whil&s;t he had the
name of King, was in fact the enemy of the whole
nation. Ten men therefore of the city, binding
them&s;elves by an oath, to run all hazards together,
armed them&s;elves with &s;hort daggers, which they
hid under their clothes. And there was a blind
man, who, being exceedingly moved at the reports
he had heard, offered him&s;elf, and took the &s;ame
oath with them. Not that he could give them any
a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but he was re&s;olved to &s;uffer with them,
if any accident befell them. And the zeal of this man
added not a little to their re&s;olution.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> goes on to relate, that they entered
into the theatre, expecting <HI>Herod</HI>'s arrival, re&s;olved,
if po&s;&s;ible, to kill <HI>Herod</HI> him&s;elf; or if they failed
of that, a good number of his attendants. But one
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s &s;pies, getting intelligence of the de&s;ign,
prevented his going to the theatre. Being &s;ei&s;ed, they
remitted nothing of their firmne&s;&s;e; they did not &s;o
much as attempt to &startq;deny their intention; but pro|duced
the &s;words they had under their clothes, and
profe&s;&s;ed that the con&s;piracy they had entered
into was laudable and pious, and that they had
not entered into it for private profit, or any other
particular intere&s;t, but for what was much more
valuable, the ancient cu&s;toms of their nation, which
it was fit that all &s;hould &s;ee ob&s;erved, or die in the
defen&s;e of them<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Antiq. 15. c. 8. &sect;. 1.&mdash;4.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS con&s;piracy again&s;t <HI>Herod</HI> him&s;elf, with all the
circum&s;tances here mentioned, mu&s;t needs &s;atisfie all
men, there is nothing improbable in the facts of this
kind related by St. <HI>Luke.</HI> According to all accounts,
this mad and furious zeal was not altogether &s;o much
<PB N="285" REF="303">
in vogue, or at &s;o great a height, in <HI>Herod</HI>'s time, as
it was afterwards.</P>
<P>&sect; X. As <HI>Judea</HI> was a Roman province, during
the time of our Saviour's mini&s;try; &s;o there appear,
in the hi&s;tory the Evangeli&s;ts have given us, many
tokens of the una&s;ine&s;&s;e, which this circum&s;tance gave
the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation.</P>
<P>THE asking Je&s;us that que&s;tion, <HI>Is it lawful for us
to give tribute to</HI> Ce&s;ar <HI>or not?</HI> Matt. xxii. 17. Mark
xii. 14. Luke xx. 21, 22. is repre&s;ented as a very &s;ub|tle
artifice to en&s;nare him. There can be no doubt,
but it would have been judged an offen&s;e again&s;t the
government they were &s;ubject to, to &s;ay it was not
lawful: and it mu&s;t have been unpopular among the
<HI>Jews</HI> to affirm it was: for otherwi&s;e there would have
been no extraordinary &s;ubtlety in this contrivance:
which yet it is plainly intimated there was.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, a <HI>Publican</HI> appears to have been a
very odious and ignominious character. They are
u&s;ually reckoned with <HI>Harlots</HI> and <HI>Sinners.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN our Lord went into the hou&s;e of <HI>Zacheus,</HI>
this being done in the view of a great crowd of &s;pecta|tors,
it is &s;aid, that <HI>all they who &s;aw it, murmured,
&s;aying, that he was gone to he gue&s;t with a man that is a
&s;inner,</HI> Luke xix. 7. They were &s;urpri&s;ed, and even
offended, that Je&s;us, whom they &s;eemed then to have
con&s;idered as a prophet, &s;hould make a vi&s;it to a man
of that character; when they them&s;elves, it is likely,
di&s;dained to have any conver&s;ation with him.</P>
<P>IT is certain, the paying taxes to the <HI>Romans</HI> was
at this time a very heavy affliction to the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation.
When <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> gives the hi&s;tory of the <HI>cen&s;us</HI> or enroll|ment
of their e&s;tates by <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> after <HI>Archelaus</HI> was
depo&s;ed by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and had been bani&s;hed into <HI>Gaul,</HI>
he &s;ays, &startq;that the <HI>Jews</HI> were at fir&s;t &s;urpri&s;ed at the
name of a <HI>cen&s;us,</HI> but that, by the per&s;wa&s;ion of
<HI>Joazar</HI> the High Prie&s;t, they generally acquie&s;ced
in it. However <HI>Judas Gaulanites</HI> a&s;&s;ociating to him|&s;elf
<HI>Sadduck</HI> a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> excited the people to rebelli|on;
<PB N="286" REF="304">
on; told them that an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement would introduce
downright &s;lavery; and per&s;waded them to a&s;&s;ert
their liberty.&mdash;The people heard their di&s;cour&s;es
with incredible plea&s;ure. And it is impo&s;&s;ible to re|pre&s;ent
the evils the nation has &s;uffered, which were
owing to the&s;e men.&mdash;For <HI>Judas</HI> and <HI>Sadduc</HI> brought
in among&s;t us this fourth Sect; and there being
many who embraced their notions, they not only
cau&s;ed di&s;turbances in the government at that time,
but laid the foundation of tho&s;e evils that followed:
which indeed are owing to this principle till then
unknown<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ant. L. xviii. c. 1. &sect; 1.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>HE then delivers the character and principles of the
three chief and more ancient &s;ects of the <HI>Jews</HI> (as he
calls them) the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> the <HI>Sadducees,</HI> and the<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &sect;. 2, 3, 4, 5.</NOTE>
<HI>E&s;&s;enes.</HI> And afterwards returns again to the men he
had been &s;peaking of before. &startq;<HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Galilean</HI> was
the leader of the fourth &s;ect. In all other points they
hold the &s;ame &s;entiments with the <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI> But they
have an invincible affection for liberty, and acknow|ledge
God alone their Lord and Governour. From
this time the nation became infected with this di&s;tem|per:
and <HI>Ge&s;&s;ius Florus,</HI> by abu&s;ing his power when
he was Pre&s;ident, threw them into de&s;pair and pro|voked
them to rebel again&s;t<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &sect;. 6.</NOTE> the <HI>Romans.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P>WHAT is here tran&s;cribed from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> is enough
to convince us, that the paying tribute to the <HI>Romans</HI>
mu&s;t have been very grievous to the <HI>Jews,</HI> and that
they who collected it for them, mu&s;t have been &s;corned
and abhorred by the people: For he &s;ays, that <HI>Judas</HI>'s
and <HI>Sadduc</HI>'s Speeches were heard by them with incre|dible
plea&s;ure; that their principle had cau&s;ed many
great evils to the nation, and that it was one ground
of the war with the <HI>Romans.</HI> But I mu&s;t make two or
three remarks. <HI>Jo&s;epbus</HI> calls this a principle <HI>till then
unknown to them.</HI> But this<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">P. 792. 37.</NOTE> is not exactly true with|out
<PB N="287" REF="305">
out &s;ome limitation. There was an oath of fidelity to
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI> tendered to the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation at the
latter end of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign. But there were above &s;ix
thou&s;and <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ant. 1. 17. p. 753. 41.</NOTE> who refu&s;ed at that time to take
it. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that at the per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>Joazar</HI> the
High-Prie&s;t the nation generally acquie&s;ced. Doubt|le&s;s
the <HI>Romans</HI> carried their point; but yet a very
deep grudge remained in the minds of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> people.
And the &s;ervice which <HI>Joazar</HI> had done the <HI>Romans</HI> up|on
this occa&s;ion rendered him &s;o unpopular, that it co&s;t
him the Prie&s;thood. The&s;e are the very words of <HI>Jo|&s;ephus:</HI>
&startq;<HI>Cyenius</HI> having made a &s;eizure of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s
effects, and fini&s;hed the <HI>cen&s;us</HI> in the thirty &s;eventh
year after the victory at <HI>Actium,</HI> con&s;tituted <HI>Ananus</HI>
the &s;on of <HI>Seth</HI> High Prie&s;t, having taking away that
dignity and honour from the High-Prie&s;t <HI>Joazar,</HI>
who was overpowered by the &s;editions and tumults
of the multitude<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Ant. 18. cap. 2. in.</NOTE>.' or in other words who had
been mobbed by the people.</P>
<P>LASTLY, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> calls <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI> the head
of a <HI>fourth &s;ect.</HI> But, though he u&s;es the&s;e words here,
he oftentimes makes but three &s;ects of the <HI>Jews.</HI> And I
think, that the &s;ect of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> mu&s;t generally have
held the &s;ame notion which he a&s;cribes to <HI>Judas.</HI> The
&s;ix thou&s;and, who refu&s;ed to take the oath above|mentioned,
were <HI>Phari&s;ees. Jo&s;ephus</HI> owns, that <HI>Ju|das</HI>'s
followers differed from the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> in nothing
el&s;e but this one principle of an exce&s;&s;ive fondne&s;&s;e for
liberty. He expre&s;sly calls <HI>Saddut,</HI> who joined with
<HI>Judas,</HI> a <HI>Phari&s;ee.</HI> And I would fain know what &s;ect
<HI>Judas</HI> had been of before. If he had been of the &s;ect
of the <HI>Sadducees</HI> or <HI>E&s;&s;enes, Jo&s;ephus</HI> would have &s;aid
&s;o. The ca&s;e &s;eems to me to have been thus: <HI>Judas</HI>
and they that held his principles were generally of the
SECT of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> but they were not PHARISEES;
becau&s;e this title was more peculiarly appropriated to
<PB N="288" REF="306">
tho&s;e, who had &s;ome di&s;tinction for their learning
riches, po&s;ts, employments; or to tho&s;e who had a
great deal of leizure, and little el&s;e to do, but to make
an uncommon &s;hew of devotion and &s;anctity. Thus, I
&s;uppo&s;e, the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> in general had this principle, but
the common people only avowed it. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> had a
difficult ta&s;k. He was concerned to &s;ave the honour
of the &s;upreme parts of the Roman Government, and
of the chief men of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation, and particularly
of tho&s;e properly called <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> of whom he was
one; and to throw the blame of the war, and all
their &s;ufferings upon the cruelty and avarice of <HI>Albinus</HI>
and <HI>Ge&s;&s;ius Florus,</HI> the two la&s;t Roman Procurators,
and the common people among the <HI>Jews</HI> and their
Leaders. This part he has acted very finely. But I
think, that if the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> had controled this principle
&s;incerely, they might have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed it. For a proof
of this, I refer the reader to the chapter of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
&s;ects, where the power of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> appears very
evident. I &s;hall here add only one pa&s;&s;age more from
<HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> &startq;And on the account of the&s;e <HI>[Principles]</HI>
they [the <HI>Phari&s;ees]</HI> are in great authority with the
people, and all parts of divine wor&s;hip, whether
prayers or &s;acrifices, are performed according to their
interpretations. This te&s;timony have the cities given
to their virtue, becau&s;e of their following in all things
that which is be&s;t, both in <HI>their</HI> words and actions.<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Antiq. 18. c. I. &sect;. 3.</NOTE></P>
<P>&sect;. XI. BUT though the Roman Tribute was a hea|vy
grievance, and they who collected it were much
hated; yet it is evident, that many <HI>Jews</HI> were em|ployed
in this work. The <HI>Publicans</HI> mentioned in the
Go&s;pels, mu&s;t have been of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation, <HI>Then
came</HI> al&s;o the PUBLICANS to be baptized, <HI>and &s;aid un|to
him,</HI> [John] <HI>ma&s;ter what &s;hall we do?</HI> Luke iii. 12.
<PB N="289" REF="307">
<HI>See</HI> Matth. xxi. 31, 32. It appears likewi&s;e, that &s;ome
of the <HI>Publicans</HI> in <HI>Judea</HI> were hone&s;t per&s;ons, and
men of &s;ub&s;tance. Such an one was <HI>Levi,</HI> or <HI>Mat|thew.
And</HI> Levi <HI>made him a great fea&s;t in his own hou&s;e:
and there, was a great company of Publicans and of others
that &s;ate down with them,</HI> Luke v. 29. <HI>See</HI> Matth. ix.
10. Mark ii. 4. Nor is there any hint of any unju&s;t
practi&s;es which <HI>Levi</HI> had been guilty of in the po&s;t he
had enjoyed. And from the great openne&s;&s;e and im|partiality,
with which the Evangeli&s;ts have writ their
hi&s;tory, it is rea&s;onable to conclude, there was no
exception again&s;t <HI>Matthew</HI>'s character, be&s;ide his em|ployment,
which undoubtedly was not reputable.
<HI>Zacheus,</HI> when he entertained Je&s;us, was certainly a
thorough convert to virtue. And, I think, he could
not have been a very wicked man before. <HI>And</HI> Za|cheus <HI>&s;tood and &s;aid,</HI>&mdash;<HI>Behold Lord, the half of my
goods I give to the poor, and if I have taken any thing from
any man by fal&s;e accu&s;ation, I re&s;tore him four fold,</HI>
Luke xix. 8. According to his computation, he &s;up|po&s;ed
Him&s;elf capable of making ample re&s;titution to
all he had injured, out of the remaining half of his
goods, and it is likely &s;uppo&s;ed he &s;hould have &s;ome|what
left for him&s;elf. His unju&s;t gains therefore were
but a &s;mall portion of his e&s;tate.</P>
<P>THAT there were <HI>Jews</HI> who were <HI>Publicans,</HI> and
that &s;ome of the&s;e were hone&s;t and wealthy men, will
appear from a &s;tory in <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> &startq;There lay near
the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> Synagogue at <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI> a piece of ground
in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a <HI>Greek</HI> of the &s;ame place. The
<HI>Jews</HI> had often attempted to make a purcha&s;e of it,
and had offered a great deal more than the intrin&s;ick
value. But the owner refu&s;ed all their offers: and,
as if he intended to affront them, began to build
workhou&s;es on the ground, leaving the <HI>Jews,</HI> but
a very &s;trait and narrow pa&s;&s;age. The warmer
part of the people attempted to ob&s;truct the build|ers.
But <HI>Florus</HI> not re&s;training the&s;e practi&s;es by
his authority,&endq; the chief men of the <HI>Jews,</HI> among
<PB N="290" REF="308">
whom was <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Publican,</HI> not knowing well
what cour&s;e to take, wait upon <HI>Florus</HI> and give him
eight talents of &s;ilver to &s;top the building. That he
might get the money into his hands, he promi&s;ed all
they de&s;ired; but having received it went away
from <HI>Ce&s;area</HI> to <HI>Scba&s;te,</HI> leaving the riotous people
to them&s;elves, as if the <HI>Jews</HI> had only purcha&s;ed a
licence to quarrel.&endq; And &s;o it happened, the <HI>Jews</HI>
and <HI>Greeks</HI> at <HI>Ce&s;area</HI> had a battle, in which the for|mer
were wor&s;ted. Upon this <HI>John</HI> with twelve of the
chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> go to <HI>Seba&s;te,</HI> and coming to <HI>Florus</HI>
&startq;make complaints to him concerning the&s;e proceed|ings,
and entreat his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, mode&s;tly putting
him in mind likewi&s;e of the<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. ii. cap. xiv. &sect;. 4, 5.</NOTE> eight talents.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS <HI>John</HI> mu&s;t have been one of the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable
of the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI> &s;ince he only is mention|ed
by name. Nor is there any thing here &s;aid of him,
but what is very honourable; unle&s;s any think &s;it to
except again&s;t the giving a bribe to a bad man to do
what is in it&s;elf ju&s;t and rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>THERE is, in the Go&s;pels, &s;o frequent mention of
<HI>Publicans</HI> who were <HI>Jews,</HI> that I have been &s;ometimes
inclined to think that the <HI>Roman</HI> tribute was collected
for the mo&s;t part by <HI>Jews.</HI> The <HI>Romans</HI> might choo&s;e
this method. The <HI>Jews</HI> imployed in this work became
odious thereby, but the Roman government was re|lieved.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. ii. c. 14. &sect;. 9.</NOTE> has made mention of &s;everal
<HI>Jews</HI> who were Roman Knights. It is certain that
the Roman Knights were the great<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Cert&egrave; huic homini &s;pes nulla &s;alutis e&s;&s;et., &s;i publicani, hoc e&s;t, &s;i equites Romani judicarent. Cic. in Verr. lib. 3. cap. 62 n. 168.</NOTE> farmers and
collectors of the Roman tribute. It &s;eems to me there|fore

I do not pretend to be ma&s;ter of the Roman method

general or other &s;uperior Officers only were
<HI>Romans.</HI> It is plain that in the province of <HI>Sicilie,</HI> in
the time of the Republic, when a new a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement was
made there, (as it was every fifth year) <HI>Sicilians</HI> were

were far from being beloved in any province<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Sic porro no&s;tros homines diligunt, ut his SOLIS neque publi|canus, neque negotiator odio &s;it. ibid. cap. 3. n. 7.</NOTE>; the
<HI>Romans</HI> might therefore judge it prudent to imploy
&s;ome natives in collecting taxes: and it is probable,
that in all places, &s;ome would be found who were wil|ling
to make an advantage of the &s;ubjection of their

think, that this order for examining St. <HI>Paul</HI> by &s;courg|ing
is unju&s;tifiable. They may be of opinion that
here were not &s;ufficient grounds of &s;u&s;picion to put
him to the Que&s;tion. To this I &s;ay: If I &s;hould here
abandon <HI>Ly&s;ias,</HI> my apology for him will, in &s;ome
re&s;pect, be &s;trengthened by it. If <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> here &s;trained

bore too hard upon his pri&s;oner, <HI>Tertuilus</HI>'s complaints
will appear the more unrea&s;onable. But I am &s;till
inclined to think, that <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> acted hone&s;tly herein.
<HI>Paul</HI> a &s;tranger to him, and he could not but pay
&s;ome regard to the vehement and general clamour of
the people of the city in which he re&s;ided, and which
was the metropolis of the province. Any man in the
&s;ame ca&s;e with <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> would have been apt to conclude,
that <HI>Paul</HI> mu&s;t have committed &s;ome offen&s;e or other,
<PB N="296" REF="314">
when <HI>they cried &s;o again&s;t him.</HI> The method of enquiry
he had appointed was not fit to be practi&s;ed upon a
Roman, but <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> did not then know that <HI>Paul</HI> was
a Roman. In other re&s;pects it mu&s;t have been unex|ceptionable;
for I cannot but think, it was a more
gentle way of examining than &s;ome others then in u&s;e.</P>
<P>&sect; VI. AFTER St. <HI>Paul</HI> had been <HI>beaten</HI> at <HI>Phi|lippi,</HI>
he complained of the inju&s;tice done him, becau&s;e
he was a Roman. As they were <HI>binding</HI> him at <HI>Jeru|&s;alem,</HI>
he claimed the privilege of a Roman citizen,
and it was granted him: for it follows: <HI>When the cen|turion
heard that, he went and told the chief captain,
&s;aying, Take heed what thou do&s;t, for this man is a Ro|man.
Then the chief captain came, and &s;aid unto him,
Tell me, art thou a Roman? He &s;aid, Yea. And the
chief captain an&s;wered, with a great &s;um obtained I this
freedom. And</HI> Paul <HI>&s;aid, But I was free born. Then
&s;traighway they departed from him which &s;hould have
examined him: and the chief captain al&s;o was afraid after
he knew that he was a Roman, and becau&s;e he had bound
him,</HI> Acts xxii. 26&mdash;29.</P>
<P>S T. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore does expre&s;sly affirm that he was
a Roman. Nor ought it to be thought &s;trange that a
<HI>Jew</HI> &s;hould be a citizen of <HI>Rome.</HI> There were many
&s;uch in&s;tances about this time. <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar</HI> be&s;tow|ed
the freedom of the city upon <HI>Aniipater</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Jo&s;eph. de. Bell. l. 1. p. 978. v. 29.</NOTE> the

number of <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s time at <HI>Rome,</HI> who had

obtained their freedom from their mailers<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">De legat. p. 1014. C. E.</NOTE> <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>
complains loudly, as well as very ju&s;tly, of <HI>Florus</HI>
the la&s;t Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> &startq;That he had been
guilty of an unheard of cruelty, and what had never
been done before, when he whipped before his tri|bunal,
and crucified men of the <HI>Eque&s;trian</HI> rank.
For, <HI>&s;ays</HI> he, though their extraction was <HI>jewi&s;h,</HI>

their quality<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Jo&s;. de Bell. l. ii. cap. 14. &s;in.</NOTE> was Roman. And our Hi&s;torian

<P>BUT though there is no improbability, but that
St. <HI>Paul</HI> might be a Roman Citizen; yet it has been
a que&s;tion how he came by this privilege. Some
learned<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Baron. Ann. A. 58. n. 147, 148. Hamm. Act. xxii. 27. Til|lemont memoir: Eccle&s;i. Wit&s;ius de vita Pauli. Sect. 1. n. 6.</NOTE> men are of opinion, that <HI>Tar&s;us</HI> was a
Roman Colony, and that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was therefore a
Citizen of <HI>Rome,</HI> by virtue of his nativity at <HI>Tar&s;us.</HI>
But it will be worth our while to take a view of St.
<HI>Luke</HI>'s account of this matter. <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> took <HI>Paul</HI> out
of the hands of the <HI>Jews. And as</HI> Paul <HI>was to be led
into the ca&s;tle, he &s;aid unto the chief captain, may I &s;peak
unto thee? Who &s;aid, Can&s;t thou &s;peak</HI> Greek? <HI>Art
not thou that</HI> Egyptian&mdash;? <HI>But</HI> Paul <HI>&s;aid, I am a man
which am a</HI> Jew <HI>of</HI> Tar&s;us, <HI>a City in</HI> Cilicia, <HI>a citizen of
no mean City: And I be&s;eech thee, &s;uffer me to &s;peak unto
the people,</HI> Acts xxi. 37&mdash;39. In his &s;peech, <HI>St.</HI> Paul
<HI>tells the</HI> Jews, I <HI>am verily a man which am a</HI> Jew, <HI>born
in</HI> Tar&s;us <HI>a city in</HI> Cilicia, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxii. 3.</P>
<P>WHEN the people had interrupted <HI>Paul</HI>'s &s;peech,
<HI>the chief captain commanded him to be brought into the
ca&s;tle, and bade that he &s;hould be examined by &s;courging,</HI>
Ch. xxii. 23, 24. The chief captain therefore did not
&s;u&s;pect as yet, that <HI>Paul</HI> was a Citizen of <HI>Rome,</HI> tho'
he had been told by <HI>Paul</HI> he was of <HI>Tar&s;us.</HI> St. <HI>Paul</HI>
had al&s;o &s;aid the &s;ame thing at the beginning of his
&s;peech to the <HI>Jews:</HI> But I do not in&s;i&s;t upon that:
for though it is likely, the chief captain &s;tood by, I
&s;uppo&s;e he did not under&s;tand <HI>Paul,</HI> his &s;peech being
made in the <HI>Hebrew Tongue.</HI></P>
<P>IT cannot be &s;aid, that the chief captain bade that
he &s;hould be examined with &s;courging, though he
knew <HI>Paul</HI> to be a Roman: becau&s;e <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> does not
<PB N="298" REF="316">
appear to be one of tho&s;e fierce officers that have no
regard to lawes. Quite the contrary: As &s;oon as <HI>Paul</HI>
had claimed his privilege, <HI>then &s;traightway they depart|ed
from him which &s;hould have examined him: and the
chief captain al&s;o was afraid after he knew that he was a
Roman, and becau&s;e he had bound him.</HI></P>
<P><HI>THEN the chief captain came and &s;aid unto him,
Tell me, art thou a Roman? He &s;aid, Yea.</HI> If <HI>Tar&s;us</HI>
had been a town of Roman Citizens, St. <HI>Paul</HI> having
before told the chief captain that he was of <HI>Tar&s;us,</HI>
the que&s;tion now put would not have been, Art thou
a Roman? but, Art thou really of <HI>Tar&s;us?</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;equel of this di&s;cour&s;e affords more proof,
<HI>The chief captain an&s;wered, With a great &s;um obtained I
this freedom. Ly&s;ias</HI> having purcha&s;ed this privilege
with a great &s;um, and ob&s;erving nothing con&s;iderable
in <HI>Paul</HI>'s per&s;on or mien, and &s;uppo&s;ing therefore that
he had no money to &s;pare, he &s;till makes a doubt of
the truth of his claim. This an&s;wer of <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> had
been altogether impertinent, if <HI>Tar&s;us</HI> had been a
town of Roman citizens. <HI>And</HI> Paul <HI>&s;aid, But I was
free born:</HI> A plain indication, that it was a privilege
derived to him from his parents. And on this account,
the oppo&s;ition between the chief captain's purcha&s;e and
<HI>Paul</HI>'s free birth is &s;trong and beautiful. If <HI>Paul</HI>'s
freedom had been owing to his nativity in any place,
the place would certainly have been mentioned in this
conference between him and <HI>Ly&s;ias.</HI></P>
<P>AND it is ob&s;ervable that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has often men|tioned
<HI>Tar&s;us,</HI> but never calls it a <HI>colony</HI> or <HI>municipium;</HI>
as he would have done, in all probability, if it had
been &s;o. Upon the whole, I think it very plain, that
St. <HI>Luke</HI> does not &s;uppo&s;e <HI>Paul</HI> to have been a Roman
by virtue of his birth at <HI>Tar&s;us.</HI></P>
<P>LET us now con&s;ider the external evidence, and
inquire what privileges the <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Greek</HI> authors
a&s;cribe to <HI>Tar&s;us. Strabo</HI> &s;ays, The people of <HI>Tar|&s;us</HI>
were much given to the &s;tudy of philo&s;ophy and
all other parts of polite literature: &startq;That <HI>Tar&s;us</HI> was

<P>UPON the whole therefore, St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account is
fully confirmed by the be&s;t authorities. <HI>Tar&s;us</HI> was no
<HI>mean City,</HI> but it was not a Municipium, or town of
Roman Citizens.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY &s;ome may enquire, if St. <HI>Paul</HI> was
not a Roman Citizen, or entitled to &s;ome other pecu|liar
privileges, by his being born at <HI>Tar&s;us,</HI> to what
purpo&s;e did he make any mention of it? I an&s;wer,
every one in St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s circum&s;tances is naturally led
to mention the place of his nativity, or re&s;idence;
e&s;pecially when he is asked, who he is. But St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s
innocence did not depend upon his being a <HI>Roman,</HI>
but a <HI>Jew.</HI> And therefore this la&s;t, together with
the place of his birth, is what he here mentions. The
outcry, when St. <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;ei&s;ed, was, <HI>Men of</HI> I&s;raels
<PB N="301" REF="319">
<HI>help, this is the man that teacheth all men every where
again&s;t the people;&mdash;And farther brought</HI> Greeks
<HI>al&s;o
into the temple and hath polluted this holy place.&mdash;
And all the city was moved, and the people ran toge|ther:
and they took</HI> Paul <HI>and drew him out of the
temple; and forthwith the doors were &s;hut,</HI> Ch. xxi
28, 29, 30.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Jews</HI> which were of <HI>A&s;ia,</HI> who began the di|&s;turbance,
knew well enough that <HI>Paul</HI> was a <HI>Jew:</HI>
but the cry being, that the <HI>temple had been polluted,</HI>
and <HI>Paul</HI> being taken by them, and drawn out of the
temple, it is likely, a great part of the multitude
thought St. <HI>Paul</HI> had been a <HI>Gentile,</HI> who had gone
beyond the bounds pre&s;cribed to &s;uch: which when,
any one but a <HI>Jew</HI> had done, he was liable to the
heavie&s;t puni&s;hment. Therefore, when the chief Cap|tain
asked him who he was, he told him he was a
JEW of <HI>Tar&s;us;</HI> which was enough to &s;atisfie him, the
<HI>Jews</HI> had no right to u&s;e him as they did, for going
into the temple. And it is ob&s;ervable, that imme|diately
upon St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s beginning to &s;peak: <HI>Men,
Brethren, and Fathers, hear ye my defence; when they
heard that he &s;pake in the</HI> Hebrew <HI>tongue to them, they
kept the more &s;ilence.</HI> This for the pre&s;ent allayed the
heat, becau&s;e it was a &s;trong pre&s;umption, that he was
not a <HI>Gentile.</HI></P>
<P>ST. <HI>Paul</HI> therefore had no rea&s;on, at this time, to
tell them he was a Roman Citizen; but it was of the

<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> has not informed us, how St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s Citi|zen&s;hip
was derived to him. He <HI>was free born:</HI> But
what was the original of this privilege does not ap|pear.
It &s;eems to me however not unlikely, that &s;ome
of St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s ance&s;tors had obtained it for &s;ervices
they had done the Roman Commonwealth in<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. Grot. in Act. xxii. 28.</NOTE> the
wars. The <HI>Jews</HI> had formerly &s;erved the Kings of
<HI>Syria</HI> in their armies, and afterwards, the <HI>Romans.</HI>
<PB N="302" REF="320">
But they had been long &s;ince di&s;charged from that &s;er|vice
upon the account of &s;ome religious &s;cruples which
they had. There are in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> the copies of the&s;e
di&s;charges given them at <HI>Ephe&s;us, Delus</HI> and other

The Decree of the <HI>Delians</HI> is thus: &startq;<HI>Baectus</HI> being <HI>Ar|chon,</HI>

<P>THIS may give ground to &s;uppo&s;e, that a good
number of <HI>Jews,</HI> who &s;erved the <HI>Romans</HI> in &s;ome auxi|liary

that it was al&s;o bought, and that at a great price, ap|pears
from a pa&s;age of <HI>Dio,</HI> which I leave with the
reader. &startq;He [<HI>Claudius</HI>] took away the freedom of
the City from many who were unworthy of it, and
he gave it without any rea&s;on to others, &s;ometimes
<PB N="303" REF="321">
to &s;ingle per&s;ons, at other times to great numbers
together. For <HI>Romans</HI> having the preference above
&s;trangers, there were many who begged the Citizen|&s;ihip
of the Emperour; and others who bought it of
<HI>Me&s;&s;alina,</HI> or the freed men. By which means this
privilege, which had been bought formerly at a
great price, became &s;o cheap, that merry people
would &s;ay, a man might be made a Roman Citizen

<P>&sect; VIII. WE have already had occa&s;ion to ob&s;erve
the Ju&s;tice of the Roman Laws in forbidding to pu|ni&s;h
any man till he had been tried and convicted. We
have &s;omething farther ob&s;ervable in the conduct of
<HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Fe&s;tus,</HI> who refu&s;ed to give <HI>Paul</HI>'s cau&s;e a
hearing, unle&s;s both parties, namely St. <HI>Paul</HI> and his
accu&s;ers, were pre&s;ent. <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> &s;ent <HI>Paul</HI> under a
&s;trong guard from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to <HI>Ce&s;area. Who when
they came to</HI> Ce&s;area, <HI>and delivered the epi&s;tle to the go|vernour</HI>
[Felix], <HI>pre&s;ented</HI> Paul <HI>al&s;o before him. And
when the governour had read the letter, he asked of what
province he was. And when he under&s;tood that he was
of</HI> Cilicia: <HI>I will hear thee, &s;aid he, when thine accu&s;ers
al&s;o are come,</HI> Acts xxiii. 33&mdash;35. xxiv. 7, 8. When
the <HI>Jews</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem de&s;ired favour</HI> of <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> again&s;t
<HI>Paul,</HI> Fe&s;tus <HI>an&s;wered, that</HI> Paul <HI>&s;hould be kept at</HI> Ce|&s;area,
<HI>and that be him&s;elf would depart &s;hortly thither.
Let them therefore, &s;aid he, which among you are able,
go down with me, and accu&s;e this man, if there be any
wickedne&s;&s;e in him,</HI> Ch. xxv. 4, 5. This is &s;omewhat
more particularly related, when <HI>Fe&s;tus declared</HI> Paul's
<HI>cau&s;e unto the king</HI> [Agrippa], <HI>&s;aying, There is a cer|tain
man left in bonds by</HI> Felix. <HI>About whom, when I
<PB N="304" REF="322">
was at</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>the chief prie&s;ts and the elders of the</HI>
Jews <HI>informed me, de&s;iring to have judgment again&s;t him.
To whom I an&s;wered,</HI> IT IS NOT THE CUSTOM OF THE

<P>&sect; IX. WE will now proceed to St. <HI>Paul</HI>' impri&s;on|ment.
I have deferred it till now, that we might
take in at once the whole account of this matter, from
his being taken into cu&s;tody at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to his two
years confinement at <HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P><HI>WHEN</HI> Ly&s;ias <HI>heard that all</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>was in an
uproar, he</HI> immediately took &s;oldiers, and ran down to
them, and when they &s;aw him, they left beating <HI>Paul.</HI>
Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and com|manded
him to be bound with two chains, <HI>Acts xxi.</HI> 32, 33.
On the morrow, becau&s;e he would know the certainty,
wherefore he was accu&s;ed of the <HI>Jews,</HI> he loo&s;ed him from
his bands, and commanded the chief prie&s;ts, and all their
<PB N="305" REF="323">
councel to appear: and brought <HI>Paul</HI> down and &s;et him before
them, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxii. 30. <HI>St.</HI> Paul was <HI>removed from</HI> Jeru&s;alem
to Ce&s;area, <HI>and</HI> Felix commanded him to be kept in <HI>Herod</HI>'s
judgment-hall. <HI>The chief prie&s;t and others went down
thither, and accu&s;ed him before</HI> Felix. <HI>After this hearing</HI>
He <HI>[Felix]</HI> commanded a centurion to keep <HI>Paul,</HI> and to let
him have liberty, and that he &s;hould forbid none of his ac|quaintance
to mini&s;ter, or come unto him, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxiv. 23.&mdash;
But after two years, <HI>Portius Fe&s;tus</HI> came into <HI>Felix's</HI> room:
and <HI>Felix</HI> willing to &s;hew the Jews a plea&s;ure, left <HI>Paul</HI>
bound, <HI>ver.</HI> 27.&mdash;<HI>King</HI> Agrippa <HI>having &s;aid to</HI> Paul: Al|mo&s;t
thou per&s;wade&s;t me to be a chri&s;tian; <HI>Paul</HI> &s;aid, I
would to God that not only thou, but al&s;o all that hear me
this day, were both almo&s;t, and altogether &s;uch as I am, ex|cept
the&s;e bonds, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxvi. 29. And when he had thus &s;poken
the king ro&s;e up,&mdash;and they talked between them&s;elves,
&s;aying, this man doth nothing worthy of death, or of bonds.
<HI>After this St.</HI> Paul <HI>was carried to</HI> Italie, and when we
came to <HI>Rome,</HI> the centurion delivered the pri&s;oners to the
captain of the guard: but <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;uffered to dwell by
him&s;elf with a &s;oldier that kept him, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxviii. 16. After
three days <HI>Paul</HI> called the chief of the <HI>Jews</HI> together. And
he &s;aid unto them,&mdash;For the hope of <HI>I&s;rael</HI> I am bound
with this chain.&mdash;And when they had appointed him a
day, there came many to him into his lodging, <HI>ver.</HI> 20.&mdash;
And <HI>Paul</HI> dwelt two whole years in his own hired hou&s;e,
and received all that came in unto him, preaching the king|dom
of God, and teaching tho&s;e things which concern the
Lord Je&s;us Chri&s;t with all confidence, no man forbidding
him, <HI>ver.</HI> 30, 31. <HI>St.</HI> Paul <HI>makes mention of his Bonds
in &s;everal of his epi&s;tles. But the&s;e places I need not
tran&s;cribe.</HI></P>
<P>WE have ob&s;erved from <HI>Cicero,</HI> that it was unlawful
to <HI>bind,</HI> as well as to <HI>&s;courge</HI> a Roman Citizen: and it
is &s;aid, that <HI>the chief captain was afraid, after he knew
that he was a Roman, and becau&s;e he had</HI> BOUND <HI>him.</HI>
And yet St. <HI>Paul</HI> was &s;everal years in <HI>Bonds.</HI> But there
is no incon&s;i&s;tence in this. A Citizen might not be bound
with thongs as a puni&s;hment, or in order to be &s;courged:
<PB N="306" REF="324">
But a Roman Citizen might certainly be kept in cu&s;to|dy,
upon ju&s;t &s;u&s;picions, or when there were any credi|ble
accu&s;ations brought again&s;t him. And there was
nothing at all illegal in the way, in which St. <HI>Paul</HI> was
confined. There are many in&s;tances in the Roman Au|thors,
of Knights and Senators of <HI>Rome,</HI> who were
chained in the &s;ame manner that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">At claudius nihil ultra &s;crutatus, citis cum militibus,&mdash;Cri&s;pinum praetorii praefectum mi&s;it: a quo repertus [Valerius A&s;ia|ticus bis con&s;ul] e&s;t apud Baias, vincli&s;que inditis in urbem raptus.

<P>IN this hi&s;tory of St. <HI>Paul</HI> there is mention &s;ometimes
of <HI>chains</HI> in the plural number, and at other times of
<HI>chain</HI> in the &s;ingular. when the chief captain <HI>took him</HI>
from the <HI>Jews,</HI> he <HI>commanded</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> <HI>him to be bound with two
chains,</HI> Acts xxi. 33. Whether St. <HI>Paul</HI> continued to be
bound with two chains &s;o long as he was kept in <HI>Judea,</HI>
I cannot &s;ay; becau&s;e, tho' the wore <HI>Bands</HI> be u&s;ed ge|nerally
afterward in the plural number, yet the word<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Act. xxii. 30.<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Act. xxvi. 29.</NOTE>
is of a general meaning, and may imply no more than
confinement, with one, or more chains. However it
is certain he was bound with but one chain whil&s;t he was
at <HI>Rome:</HI> for it is &s;aid, that <HI>Paul was &s;uffered to dwell
with a &s;oldier that kept him,</HI> Ch. xxviii. 16. And he tells
<HI>the chief of the</HI> Jews, whom he had &s;ent for there, <HI>that
for the hope of</HI> I&s;rael <HI>he was</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE> <HI>bound with this chain.</HI>
And in another place he &s;ays (though the text is gene|rally
thought not to relate to this confinement), <HI>The
Lord give mercy to the hou&s;e of</HI> One&s;iphorus, <HI>for he o&s;t
refre&s;hed me, and was not a&s;hamed of my</HI> CHAIN, 2 <HI>Tim.</HI>
i. 16.</P>
<P>THE way of <HI>chaining</HI> pri&s;oners was in this manner.
There was an iron chain of a convenient length, which
was fa&s;tened, at one end, to the hand of the pri&s;oner,
<PB N="307" REF="325">
and at the other, to the arm of the &s;oldier. When a
per&s;on was committed to the care of one Soldier, which
was a very common way, and con&s;equently there was
but one chain, the chain was fa&s;tened to the right arm
of the pti&s;oner, and to the left arm of the &s;oldier. This
is evident from a pa&s;&s;age of<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Aliorum aurea catena e&s;t, &amp; laxa&mdash;&s;ed quid refert? eadem cu|&s;todia univer&s;os circumdedit. Allegatique &s;unt etiam qui allegaverunt. Ni&s;i tu forte leviorem in &s;ini&s;tra catenam putas. Seneca de Tranquil. cap. 10. Quemadmodum eadem catena, &amp; cu&s;todiam &amp; militem c$|pulat, &s;ic i&s;ta quae tam di&s;&s;imilia &s;unt, pariter incedunt. Id. Epi&s;t. 5.</NOTE> <HI>Seneca.</HI> It is ea&s;ie to
conclude, that when a &s;econd &s;oldier, and another
chain was appointed, the pri&s;oner mu&s;t wear the other
chain on his left hand, and the &s;oldier on his right.</P>
<P>IT is likely, that this method of confinement ob|tained
very much all over the <HI>Roman Empire.</HI> St. <HI>Peter</HI>
was bound thus at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> by <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> then
King of <HI>Judea. The &s;ame night</HI> Peter <HI>was &s;leeping be|tween
two &s;oldiers, bound with two chains, and the keepers
before the door of the pri&s;on,</HI> Acts xii. 6.</P>
<P>IT is ob&s;ervable, that when <HI>Ly&s;ias</HI> brought <HI>Paul</HI> be|fore
the council, <HI>that he might know wherefore he was
accu&s;ed of the</HI> Jews, HE LOOSED <HI>him from his bands,</HI> Ch.
xxii. 30. But it is &s;omewhat doubtful, whether St. <HI>Paul</HI>
had not his chain on, when he appeared before <HI>Agrippa;</HI>
for he &s;ays, <HI>I would to God that all that hear me this day
were altogether &s;uch as I am, except the&s;e bands.</HI> Perhaps
St. <HI>Paul</HI> means no more hereby than this &s;tate of impri|&s;onment.
I think indeed that it was not a generous
treatment of his pri&s;oner, nor very decent upon other
accounts, for <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> to &s;et <HI>Paul</HI> before <HI>Agrippa</HI> and <HI>Ber|nice,</HI>
with his chains on. However, there was a Ro|man
of con&s;iderable quality, who was accu&s;ed, and
made his defen&s;e before the Senate of <HI>Rome,</HI> in the reign
of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> with his chains<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ii&s;dem con&s;ulibus mi&s;eriarum ac &s;aevitiae exemplum atrox, reus pater, accu&s;ator filius, nomen utrique Vibius Serenus, in &s;enatuam in|ducti &s;unt.

ST. <HI>Paul</HI> &s;eems to have been under a <HI>military cu&s;tody.</HI>
I need not remind the reader of any particulars for a
proof of this: It runs through the whole account. There
were however &s;everal changes of the manner of his con|finement.
At fir&s;t, he was carried into the Ca&s;tle of
<HI>Antonia</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> chained undoubtedly to a &s;oldier,
or &s;oldiers, <HI>Ch.</HI> xxi. 37. xxii. 24. for that mu&s;t be &s;up|po&s;ed
all along. When he was &s;ent to <HI>Ce&s;arca, Felix
commanded that he &s;hould be kept in</HI> Herod's <HI>judgment-hall,</HI>
Ch. xxiii. 35. But there was &s;ome alteration made, af|ter
that <HI>Felix</HI> had heard <HI>Paul</HI> and the High Prie&s;t and
others that came down from <HI>Jeru&s;alem. And he</HI> [Felix]
<HI>commanded a centurion to keep</HI> Paul, <HI>and to let him have
liberty, and that he &s;hould forbid none of his acquaintance
to mini&s;ter, or come unto him,</HI> Acts xxiv. 23. The&s;e
are certainly new orders, the former &s;traitne&s;&s;e
mu&s;t have been hereupon abated; and perhaps the
place of confinement was changed. I am inclined to
think, that St. <HI>Paul</HI> was now removed from <HI>Herod's
judgment-hall,</HI> to the Centurion's own habitation, or to
that part of the city where the &s;oldiers had their
quarters.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t gentle ea&s;ie confinement of all was
that which St. <HI>Paul</HI> had at <HI>Rome.</HI> There <HI>he was &s;uffer|ed
to dwell by him&s;elf with a &s;oldier that kept him,</HI> Ch.
xxviii. 16.&mdash;in his <HI>lodging,</HI> ver. 25.&mdash;<HI>in his own hired
hou&s;e,</HI> ver. 30. This mu&s;t have been owing very much
to the honourable te&s;timonial, which <HI>Porcius Fe&s;tus</HI>
tran&s;mitted with him, and in part, it is likely, to the
account given in by the Centurion, who had conducted
<HI>Paul</HI> and the other pri&s;oners from <HI>Ce&s;area</HI> into <HI>Italie;</HI>
as al&s;o in part, and perhaps chiefly, to the goodne&s;&s;e<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. lib. xiv. c. 15, &amp; 51. Dio lib. lxii. p. 706. E.</NOTE>

he was then in.'&mdash;But <HI>Antonia</HI><NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot">Widow of <HI>Dru&s;us, Tiberius</HI>'s brother, a Lady &s;o great virtue, and at good terms with <HI>Tiberius.</HI> Vid. Jo&s;eph. p. 812.</NOTE> was extremely
afflicted at this misfortune of <HI>Agrippa,</HI> and yet &s;he
judged it very difficult to &s;ay any thing to <HI>Tiberius</HI> in
his favour: and that indeed it would be to no purpo&s;e.
She therefore went to <HI>Macro,</HI> and de&s;ired that he
<PB N="310" REF="328">
would take care that the &s;oldiers which kept guard
upon him &s;hould he civil, good natured fellows, and
that the Centurion who pre&s;ided over the guard, and
the &s;oldier<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> to whom <HI>Agrippa</HI> was bound, might
be men of the &s;ame character, and that his freed men
and friends might have acce&s;&s;e to him, and in a word,
that he might want nothing nece&s;&s;ary for his health.
The&s;e therefore went to him, his friend <HI>Silas,</HI> and his
freed men <HI>Mar&s;yas</HI> and <HI>Stoechus,</HI> who brought him
the provi&s;ion he cho&s;e to have. They brought in
likewi&s;e bed-clothes and &s;uch like things as if they
were for &s;ale, which they accommodated him with at
night, the &s;oldiers them&s;elves joyning with them in
the&s;e &s;ervices, in obedience to <HI>Macro's</HI> orders. Thus
things went with <HI>Agrippa</HI> for &s;ix months<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Ibid. p. 814, 815.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Tiberius</HI> was dead, &startq;there came two letters
to <HI>Rome</HI> from <HI>Caius [Caligula],</HI> one to the Senate,
notifying the death of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and his own acce&s;&s;ion
to the Empire; and another to <HI>Pi&s;o</HI> the Prefect of
the City containing the &s;ame things, and al&s;o ordering
that <HI>Agrippa</HI> &s;hould be removed from the<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> Preto|rium
to the hou&s;e in which he had lived before he was
bound. Here indeed he was in cu&s;tody, but however
he had more liberty, and was at ea&s;e. In a &s;hort time
<HI>Caius</HI> came to <HI>Rome,</HI>&mdash;and in a few days after, &s;ent
for <HI>Agrippa</HI> to his palace, ordered him to be &s;haved,
and changed his garments; and then put a Diadem
on his head&mdash;and made him al&s;o a pre&s;ent of a gold
chain of the &s;ame weight with the iron one with which
he had been<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ib. p. 818.</NOTE> bound. This chain <HI>Agrippa</HI> after|ward
laid up in the Temple of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> as a monu|ment
that God can bring down tho&s;e things that are
great, and rai&s;e up tho&s;e things which are<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Id. l. 19. c. 6. in.</NOTE> fallen.&endq;</P>
<P>I take it, that <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s fir&s;t confinement was of the
&s;ame kind with that, which was allotted St. <HI>Paul</HI> by
<HI>Felix,</HI> after the fir&s;t hearing at <HI>Ce&s;area;</HI> with this dif|ference
however, that a good deal of <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s kind
<PB N="311" REF="329">
u&s;age was given him by &s;tealth, it not being by the or|ders
of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> by whom he was committed: Where|as,
the Centurion, who kept St. <HI>Paul,</HI> had expre&s;s or|ders
from <HI>Felix,</HI> the chief officer in the province, <HI>to let
him have liberty, and to forbid none of his acquaintance to
mini&s;ter, or come unto him;</HI> which mu&s;t have been a con|&s;iderable
advantage. And I reckon that <HI>Agrippa</HI>'s con|finement
at la&s;t, when he was <HI>removed to the hou&s;e he had
lived in before he was bound,</HI> was of the &s;ame kind with
St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s cu&s;tody, when he <HI>dwelt</HI> at <HI>Rome in his own
hired hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>&sect; X. OUR taking in at once the whole &s;tory of St.
<HI>Paul</HI>'s impri&s;onment has obliged us to pa&s;s by a parti|cular
or two, which the reader will, perhaps, think it
worth while to look back for.</P>
<P>I think it not needful to enquire what St. <HI>Paul</HI>'s right
of appeal was founded in, whether in his citizen&s;hip, or
not. I &s;hall only ob&s;erve, that he does not in&s;i&s;t upon
that expre&s;sly, but only his innocence, <HI>Acts</HI> xxv. 10, 11.
Some learned men have indeed, upon the occa&s;ion of
this appeal, cited the words of <HI>Plinie;</HI> in which he tells
<HI>Trajan,</HI> that he had noted down &s;ome of tho&s;e who
were infected with Chri&s;tianity to be &s;ent to <HI>Rome, be|cau&s;e
they were</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Fuerunt alii &s;imilis amentiae: quos quia cives Romani erant, annotavi in urbem remittendos. Lib. $. cp. 97.</NOTE> <HI>Citizens.</HI> But I cannot perceive to
what purpo&s;e the&s;e words are alleged here. For if <HI>Plinie</HI>
&s;ent tho&s;e per&s;ons to <HI>Rome,</HI> not for &s;ome &s;pecial rea&s;on,
but becau&s;e his power extended only to the lives of
<HI>Provincials,</HI> and not of Roman Citizens, then his pow|er
was not at that time equal to that of the Roman Go|vernours
in <HI>Judea.</HI> It is plain from St. <HI>Luke,</HI> that <HI>Paul</HI>
was pro&s;ecuted by the <HI>Jews</HI> for his life, <HI>Acts</HI> xxv. 11. 24,
25. after he was known to be a Roman. And it is as
plain from <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> that the Roman Governours of <HI>Ju|dea</HI>
had power over the lives of <HI>Romans. Cumanus</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">De Bell. lib. a. c. 12. &sect; 2.</NOTE>
put to death a Roman Soldier in <HI>Judea.</HI> And when <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
complains of <HI>Florus</HI>'s crucifying &s;ome <HI>Jews</HI> who
<PB N="312" REF="330">
were Roman Knights, he would have complained of
&s;omewhat el&s;e be&s;ide the manner of their death, if <HI>Flo|rus</HI>
had had no right to pronounce a capital &s;entence
upon any Roman whatever. And thus I have by the
by, given the evidence of a very material circum&s;tance
in this hi&s;tory, namely, that <HI>Felix</HI> and <HI>Fe&s;tus</HI> had pow|er
of trying a Roman for life.</P>
<P>UPON <HI>Paul</HI>'s appeal to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> he was in fact &s;ent to
<HI>Rome;</HI> cau&s;es were therefore by appeal removed out
of the provinces to <HI>Rome. Suetonius</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Augu|&s;tus</HI>
appointed a number of Con&s;ular per&s;ons at <HI>Rome</HI>
to receive the appeals of provincial people, namely one
per&s;on to pre&s;ide over the affairs of each province<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Appellationes quotannis urbanorum quidem litigatorum praetori delegavit: ac provincialium con&s;ularibus viris, quos &s;ingulos cuju&s;que provinciae negotiis praepo&s;ui&s;&s;et. Vit. Augu&s;t. c. 33.</NOTE>.</P>

<P><PB N="313" REF="331">
&sect; XI. THERE remains but one thing more. <HI>And
when we came to</HI> Rome, <HI>the centurion delivered the pri&s;o|ners
to the</HI> CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD: <HI>but</HI> Paul <HI>was
&s;uffered to dwell by him&s;elf, with a &s;oldier that kept him,</HI>
Acts xxviii. 16. Doubtle&s;s <HI>Paul</HI> was con&s;igned by <HI>Felix
to the captain of the guard,</HI> as well as the other <HI>pri&s;oners:</HI>
but he was &s;uffered to <HI>dwell by him&s;elf,</HI> the re&s;t were
ordered to a more &s;trait confinement. The only thing
we have to ob&s;erve here is, that the Captain of the
guard often had the cu&s;tody of pri&s;oners. This appears
from the hi&s;tory, I have given above, of <HI>Agrippa.</HI> And
it &s;eems, that generally the pri&s;oners which were &s;ent
from the provinces were tran&s;mitted to this officer, and
not to the Prefect of the City. For &s;o <HI>Trajan</HI> directs
<HI>Plinie,</HI> when he had writ to him for &s;ome advice con|cerning

<HEAD TYPE="sub">Three remarkable Facts.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">I. The Temple forty &s;ix years in building. II. The
dearth in lbs reign of Claudius. III. The Jews ba|ni&s;hed
from Rome by the &s;ame Emperour.</HEAD>
<P>&sect; I _WHEN our Saviour was at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> at
one of the <HI>Jews</HI> Pa&s;&s;overs, he <HI>made
a &s;courge of &s;mall cords,</HI> and drove
them that <HI>&s;old oxen and &s;heep, and the
changers of money out of the temple,</HI>
John ii. 14, 15. This action implied
a claim of &s;ome particular authority. <HI>Then an&s;wered
the</HI> Jews, <HI>and &s;aid unto him, what &s;ign &s;hewe&s;t thou unto
us, &s;eeing that thou doe&s;t the&s;e things? Je&s;us an&s;wered and
&s;aid unto them, De&s;troy this temple, and in three days I
will rai&s;e it up. Then &s;aid the Jews</HI> FORTY AND SIX
YEARS WAS THIS TEMPLE IN BUILDING, <HI>and wilt thou
rear it up in three days?</HI> ver. 18&mdash;20. Or in other
words: &startq;Forty and &s;ix years has this temple been build|ing,
&s;o far as the work is carried on: And many
thou&s;and men have been employed upon it all this
time. And wilt thou alone rebuild it in three days
time, if it were pulled down and demoli&s;hed?&endq;</P>
<P>IT ought to be ob&s;erved here, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has in|formed
us that<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">De Bell. l. I. c. 21. ant. 15. c. 11.</NOTE> <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, in the eighteenth
year of his reign, made a propo&s;al to the <HI>Jews</HI> of re|building
the temple. In eight or nine years time He
fini&s;hed what he intended to do to this &s;acred place.
But the people of the <HI>Jews</HI> were, after this, as it &s;eems,
continually adorning and emproviug the buildings of
the temple.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="333">
IT is highly probable, that the term of forty &s;ix
years, mentioned here by the <HI>Jews</HI> in their reply to
our Saviour, commences at the time when <HI>Herod</HI> made
his propo&s;al to the <HI>Jews,</HI> or el&s;e, at the time when in
pur&s;uance of that propo&s;al he actually &s;et about repair|ing
the temple.</P>
<P>THERE being &s;ome chronological difficulties attend|ing
the period of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, as well as our Saviour's
mini&s;try, there is between learned men the difference
of two or three years about the exact time when the&s;e
words were &s;poken by the <HI>Jews.</HI> But I have no occa|&s;ion
at pre&s;ent to concern my&s;elf with any of tho&s;e dif|ficulties:
becau&s;e it is ea&s;ie to &s;hew, that the buildings
of the temple were continued below any of the dates af|fixed
to this di&s;cour&s;e between our Saviour and the
<HI>Jews.</HI></P>
<P>THE Evidences for this fact are the&s;e: <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> re|lating
affairs which happened in the reign of <HI>Nero,</HI> after
the arrival of <HI>Ge&s;&s;ius Florus</HI> Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> in the
year of the Chri&s;tian <HI>Era</HI> 65<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">U&s;&s;er. Ann.</NOTE>, &s;ays: &startq;At that time
was the temple fini&s;hed. The people therefore<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Ant. 20. c. 8. &sect; 7.</NOTE>
&s;eeing the workmen to the number of eighteen thou|&s;and
lie idle, and apprehending that they would &s;tand
in need of the wages which they were wont to receive
for working at the temple; and being afraid that
the money, if laid up, &s;hould fall into the hands of
the <HI>Romans;</HI> and moreover having a regard to the
workmen, and being willing that the trea&s;ures &s;hould
be laid out upon them (for if any man worked but
one hour of the day, he pre&s;ently received his pay)
they petitioned the King<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Agrippa the younger.</NOTE> to rebuild the Ea&s;t Por|tico.
<PB N="316" REF="334">
tico.&mdash;It was the work of King <HI>Solomon</HI> who fir&s;t
built the whole temple. But the King (the charge
and over&s;ight of the temple had been committed to
him by <HI>Claudius Ce&s;ar)</HI> con&s;idering&mdash;that this
would be a work of much time and va&s;t expen&s;e, did
not grant their reque&s;t. However he was not again&s;t
paving the city with white marble.&endq;</P>
<P>IT appears from hence, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had continual|ly
employed men upon the temple: for <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays,
it was now fini&s;hed.</P>
<P>IF it be enquired, how they were &s;upplied with mo|ney
to maintain &s;o many men con&s;tantly at work; I
an&s;wer, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> in the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t now tran&s;crib|ed,
intimates what the fund was, namely, their &s;acred
trea&s;ury. He has more particularly informed us in an|other
place, where he &s;ays; that on the temple were
expended &startq;all the &s;acred trea&s;ures, which were &s;up|plied
by tributes &s;ent to God from all parts of the
world<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">de Bell. l. v. c. 5. &sect; 1.</NOTE>.&endq;
Be&s;ide the ordinary tribute &s;ent to the
temple, the zeal of the people for this work produced
liberal contributions<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">id. Ibid. vid. &amp; Ant. 1. 14. c. 7. &sect; z.</NOTE></P>
<P>IF it be objected that <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> in the account of
the building of the temple by <HI>Herod,</HI> &s;ays, That the
$word$, that is, the cloy&s;ters and other buildings of the
temple were rai&s;ed in eight years, and the Naeos or tem|ple
it&s;elf in a year and a half<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ant. l. 15. c. 11. &sect; 5, 6.</NOTE> that is, in nine years
and a half; I an&s;wer, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> can mean no more
than that the temple was then fitted for u&s;e, or that all
was then fini&s;hed that <HI>Herod</HI> propo&s;ed to do at his co&s;t;
and not the compleating the temple and all the build|ings
belonging to it. This is evident from the pa&s;&s;age
ju&s;t de&s;cribed at length, in which he &s;ays: <HI>At that time
the temple was funi&s;hed.</HI> And even the&s;e words are to be
<PB N="317" REF="335">
under&s;tood with a limitation. The temple was not
then compleated: there was &s;omething &s;till wanting,
which the people would have had done. But they then
put an end to repairing and building, and there was no
more work done at the temple.</P>
<P>IT is po&s;&s;ible, that there might be &s;ome interruptions
in the works at the temple; but it is likely, they were
very &s;hort (if there were any) and &s;uch as were not
worth taking notice of in a long period.</P>
<P>&sect; II. <HI>THE next event I would here confirm from
&s;ome foreign te&s;timony, is, the famine &s;aid to have hap|pened
in the reign of</HI> Claudius. And in the&s;e days came
prophets from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> unto <HI>Antioch.</HI> And there &s;tood
up one of them named <HI>Agabus;</HI> and &s;ignified by the Spirit,
that there &s;hould be great dearth throughout all the world,
which came to pa&s;s in the days of <HI>Claudius Ce&s;ar.</HI> Then
the di&s;ciples, every man according to his ability, determined
to &s;end relie&s;e unto the brethren which dwelt in <HI>Judea.</HI>
Which al&s;o they did, and &s;ent it to the elders, by the hands
of <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul,</HI> Acts xi. 27&mdash;30.</P>
<P>I do not take notice of this famine as the fulfil|ment
of a prophecy; becau&s;e I do not enter into that
argument: but only, as a remarkable event which St.
<HI>Luke</HI> a&s;&s;ures us happened in the reign of <HI>Claudius.</HI></P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays: <HI>In the&s;e days came prophets from</HI> Jeru|&s;alem
<HI>unto</HI> Antioch. It may be que&s;tioned what was
the exact time of the arrival of the&s;e prophets to <HI>Antioch,</HI>
and of the delivery of the prophecy. But, I think, it
is ea&s;ie to perceive from St. <HI>Luke,</HI> when the famine hap|pened.
It is ob&s;ervable that St. <HI>Luke</HI> having, in the
words ju&s;t now tran&s;cribed from him in the conclu&s;ion
of the xith of the <HI>Acts,</HI> given an account of the re&s;olu|tion
of the church at <HI>Antioch,</HI> and of the commi&s;&s;ion
given by them to <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> to carry their con|tributions
to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> proceeds in the xiith chapter to
relate the tran&s;actions concerning the church at <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI>
during the reign of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> and al&s;o <HI>Herod</HI>'s
death. And then &s;ays: <HI>But the word of God grew and
multiplied. And</HI> Barnabas <HI>and</HI> Saul <HI>returned from</HI> Jeru|&s;alem,
<PB N="318" REF="336">
<HI>when they had fulfilled their mini&s;try,</HI> Acts xii,
24, 25.</P>
<P>THERE can be no rea&s;on a&s;&s;igned for that interrup|tion
in the cour&s;e of the narration, and for the delay to
mention the fulfilment of the commi&s;&s;ion of the church
of <HI>Antioch,</HI> but this; that the commi&s;&s;ion was not exe|cuted,
till the death of <HI>Herod Agrippa.</HI> Moreover, as
the Chri&s;tians at <HI>Antioch</HI> had a previous knowledge of
this famine, according to St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s account, before it
happened; it is rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that the famine
was but then coming on, when <HI>Barnabas</HI> and <HI>Saul</HI> ful|filled
their mini&s;try. <HI>Herod</HI> died in the fourth year of
<HI>Claudius</HI>'s reign, A. D. 44. It is very evident therefore
to me, that<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Vid. U&s;&s;er. Ann. P. J. 4755.</NOTE> the commencement of this famine ought
not to be placed before the latter end of the year 44, or
perhaps, not till the beginning of the year following.</P>
<P>BUT before I proceed to the proofs of this fact, I
mu&s;t let the reader know, how I under&s;tand it. I think
the dearth prophe&s;ied of by <HI>Agabus,</HI> and related by St.
<HI>Luke,</HI> was in <HI>Judea</HI> only. I de&s;ire the words them&s;elves
may be con&s;idered. There <HI>came prophets to</HI> Jeru&s;alem,
<HI>and one of them &s;ignified by the Spirit that there &s;hould be
great dearth throughout the whole world,</HI> that is, through|out
the whole land, the country before mentioned, from
whence the&s;e prophets came, namely, the land of <HI>Ju|dea:</HI>
That there would be a great dearth and &s;carcity,
not at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> only, which might have been occa&s;ion|ed
by &s;ome circum&s;tances peculiar to the city, a &s;iege
or &s;ome other accident; but that there would be &s;carci|ty,
throughout all the land of <HI>Judea,</HI> by means of a
general failure of the u&s;ual produce of the earth.</P>
<P>THE original word [FOR] does &s;ometimes &s;ignifie

<P>I hope no one will do me &s;o much wrong, as to &s;u&s;|pect,
that I have attempted to put this meaning on

only a particular one, I would have acknowledged the

<P>BUT though there is mention made of famines in <HI>Greece,</HI> and at <HI>Rome,</HI> or in <HI>Italie;</HI> this will not prove that there was a general famine. It is evident from <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> that during the famine in <HI>Judea,</HI> there was plenty in other parts; in <HI>Cyprus, Egypt,</HI> and the territories of King <HI>Izates.</HI> From the two former countries Queen <HI>Helene</HI> procured provi&s;ions, and <HI>Izates</HI> &s;ent money to <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> which he could not have done, if his own people had been in want.</P>
<P>THE proofs of the famine in <HI>Judea</HI> I tran&s;cribe, or refer to in the <HI>Text part.</HI> Of the other famines in this reign there are the&s;e accounts. Of the famine in <HI>Greece Eu&s;ebius</HI> makes mention in his <HI>Chronicon,</HI> p. 204. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> This famine happened, according to him, in the 9th of <HI>Claudius, A. D.</HI> 49. At <HI>Rome</HI> there were &s;everal famines in this reign, one, or more of which are mentioned by <HI>Dio, Suetonius, Tacitus</HI> or <HI>Oro&s;ius.</HI> The fir&s;t happened in the beginning of the reign of this Emperour. But it &s;eems, from the provi&s;ions made by him for preventing the like for the future, that it was not owing to a general &s;carcity at that time, but to the want of a good harbour at the mouth of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> by which means the city was ill &s;upplied. <HI>Dio's</HI> words are thus: &startq;There being a great famine [<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> or <HI>Scarcity,</HI>] He [<HI>Claudius</HI>] not only took care for a pre&s;ent &s;upply, but provided al&s;o for the time to come. <HI>Rome</HI> is &s;upplied almo&s;t &s;olely with corn imported from abroad, but there being then no good harbour at the mouth of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> nor any &s;ecure &s;tations for &s;hips, the empire of the &s;ea was almo&s;t u&s;ele&s;s to the <HI>Romans.</HI> For except the corn that was brought in the &s;ummer time, and laid up in granaries, none was brought thither in the winter: or if any attempted it, it was with the utmo&s;t hazard.&endq; Dio lib. 60. p. 671, 672. He then proceeds to de&s;cribe the great expen&s;e which <HI>Claudius</HI> was at in making a good port at the mouth of the <HI>Tiber,</HI> and a conve|nient pa&s;&s;age from thence up to the City; of which <HI>Suetonius</HI> likewi&s;e &s;peaks, <HI>Claud,</HI> cap. 20. <HI>Dio</HI> places this famine in the &s;econd year of <HI>Claudius,</HI> A. D. 42. But it mu&s;t have begun the year before: for there are extant medals &s;truck in each of the&s;e years in honour of the Em|perour, having on their rever&s;e a corn mea&s;ure with ears of corn hang|ing over the &s;ide. Vid Pagi Critic. in Baron, A. D. 42. n. 7. But I Very much que&s;tion, whether there was any famine then ari&s;ing from the failure of crops. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is often u&s;ed for a famine or &s;carcity in a city during a fiege, or blockade. And <HI>Dio</HI> proceeding, immediate|ly after the mention of the famine, to ob&s;erve the difficulty of coming to <HI>Rome</HI> in the winter, makes me &s;u&s;pect, this &s;carcity was only a hard&s;hip the people were in during the winter for want of &s;ufficient &s;tores and a free pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>THERE was another famine at <HI>Rome,</HI> in the latter end of this reign, of which <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;peaks. It is placed by him in the 11th of <HI>Claudius.</HI> A. D. 51. Claudio V. Serv.

Ann. 12. cap. 43. <HI>Suetonius</HI> al&s;o has taken notice of a famine in this reign. He does not &s;ay, what year it happened in; but the agreement of circum|&s;tances &s;hews it to be the &s;ame that <HI>Tacitus</HI> &s;peaks of.

<P>I have &s;et down the&s;e pa&s;&s;ages at length. I reckon, I have hereby &s;aved my&s;elf the trouble of making many remarks. The <HI>frugum ege|&s;tas</HI> of <HI>Tatitu&s;,</HI> the <HI>a&s;&s;iduae &s;terilitates of Suetonius</HI> were in <HI>Italie</HI> only, and the&s;e, po&s;&s;ibly, not &s;o much owing to bad &s;ea&s;ons, as wrong ma|nagement; as is intimated by <HI>Tacitus.</HI> This was certainly one rea&s;on why famines were &s;o common at <HI>Rome.</HI> There is no notice taken by the&s;e authors, of &s;carcities in other places at the &s;ame time. The fa|mine, as de&s;cribed by <HI>Tacitus,</HI> was only in the winter. And when the granaries at <HI>Rome</HI> were almo&s;t empty, by the goodne&s;&s;e of the Gods, and the mildne&s;&s;e of the winter [mode&s;ti&acirc; hiemis] Ships arrived &s;afe with &s;ufficient provi&s;ions.</P>
<P>I am not at all &s;ollicitous to prove, that there was no general famine throughout the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> in the reign of <HI>Claudius.</HI> However, I thought it not ami&s;s to let the reader &s;ee how the ca&s;e &s;eems to me to &s;tand at pre&s;ent. And though &s;ome per&s;on &s;hould hereafter &s;hew, that there was an univer&s;al famine &s;ome time in this reign; yet that alone would not alter my opinion concerning the meaning of the words of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> who, I think, &s;peaks of nothing be&s;ide a <HI>dearth</HI> in <HI>Judea.</HI></P></NOTE></P>

the ancient rigour with which they had treated Pro&s;e|lytes;

<P>THE Hi&s;tory of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> is at|tended
with many difficulties. <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
and <HI>Heathen</HI> authors concur with the &s;a|cred

pretended, that there are other particu|lars,

<P><PB N="328" REF="346">
AMONG the&s;e, the difficulties, which may be very
properly con&s;idered in the fir&s;t place, are tho&s;e which
relate to the account St. <HI>Luke</HI> has given of the <HI>Taxing</HI>
in <HI>Judea,</HI> which brought <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and the Virgin to <HI>Beth|lehem</HI>
a little before the birth of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>AND it came to pa&s;&s;e in tho&s;e days, <HI>&s;ays St.</HI> Luke,
that there went out a decree from <HI>Ce&s;ar Augu&s;tus,</HI> that all
the world &s;hould be taxed. (And this taxing was fir&s;t made
when <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Governour of <HI>Syria</HI>). And all went
to be taxed, every one in his own city. And <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> al&s;o
went up from <HI>Galilee,</HI> out of the city of <HI>Nazareth,</HI> into
<HI>Judea,</HI> unto the city of <HI>David,</HI> which is called <HI>Bethlehem</HI>
(becau&s;e he was of the hou&s;e and linage of <HI>David</HI>) to be
taxed with <HI>Mary</HI> his e&s;pou&s;ed wife, being great with childe,

taxing of people all over the world, or the whole <HI>Roman
Empire,</HI> in the time of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> nor of any decree of
the Emperour for that purpo&s;e: Whereas, if there had
been then any &s;uch thing, it is highly improbable, that
it &s;hould have been omitted by them.</P>
<P>II. ST. <HI>Matthew</HI> [Ch. ii. I.] &s;ays, that Je&s;us was born
<HI>in the days of</HI> Herod <HI>the king. Judea</HI> therefore was not
at that time a Roman province, and there could not be
any <HI>taxing</HI> made there by a decree of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>III. <HI>CYRENIUS</HI> was not Governour of <HI>Syria</HI>
till nine or ten, perhaps twelve years after the birth of
Je&s;us. St. <HI>Luke</HI> therefore was mi&s;taken, in &s;aying, that
this taxing was made in his time. This objection will
be &s;tated more fully hereafter.</P>
<P>&sect;. I. BY way of an&s;wer to the fir&s;t objection.</P>
<P>1. I allow that there is not any mention made by an|cient

<P>SOME have alleged, as a proof of this general tax|ing,
&s;ome words of <HI>Suidas,</HI> who in his <HI>Lexicon</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">In Voc. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> &s;ays,
&startq;That <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> &s;ent out twenty men of great probity,

of per&s;ons and e&s;tates, ordering a certain
quota to be paid into the trea&s;ury. This was the fir&s;t
cen&s;us, they who were before him having at plea&s;ure
exacted tribute of tho&s;e who had any thing; &s;o that
it was a public crime to be rich.&endq;</P>

<P>IN another place <HI>Suidas</HI> &s;ays; &startq;<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had a de|&s;ire
to know the number of all the inhabitants of the

mu&s;t have been mi&s;taken. Archbi&s;hop <HI>U&s;her</HI>'s re|mark

Con&s;ul&s;hip [<HI>Caius Marcius Cen&s;orinus,</HI> and <HI>C. A&s;inius

<PB N="332" REF="350">
for otherwi&s;e, with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, I &s;hould think them, in

incredible, that there &s;hould have been at <HI>Rome</HI> and in
the country round about it, be&s;ide &s;trangers and &s;laves,
which were very numerous, &s;o many Roman Citizens
as are mentioned on the <HI>Ancyran</HI> Marble; even though
all, who were entred in a cen&s;us, be &s;et down there;
which however is denied by &s;ome. I &s;uppo&s;e then, that
by the Mu&s;ter of the City, the&s;e learned men mean the
mu&s;ter or cen&s;us of Roman Citizens in any part of the
<HI>Roman Empire;</HI> as oppo&s;ed to all the people in general,
living in the &s;ame Empire. And in this &s;en&s;e only<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">I think this evidently <HI>Ku&s;ter</HI>'s &s;en&s;e.

I adopt their cen&s;ure of <HI>Suidas:</HI> and cannot but think it
very ju&s;t. The number of the inhabitants of the <HI>Roman
Empire</HI> mu&s;t needs have exceeded the numbers mention|ed
by <HI>Suidas,</HI> or on the marble; though it &s;hould be
&s;uppo&s;ed, that none are included in the&s;e numbers, but
tho&s;e who were arrived at military age. This might
be &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that the number of the An|cyran
Marble is not the number of all the people
of the <HI>Roman Empire:</HI> but other rea&s;ons will appear
pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>I mu&s;t in the next place take the liberty of con&s;ider|ing
what Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> has &s;aid upon this &s;ubject, who
with <HI>Huet</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Demon. Evang. ubi &s;upra &sect;. iii.</NOTE>, and others, thinks, that this de&s;cription
or &s;urvey in <HI>Judea</HI> belonged to one of the &s;urveys made
by <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> and that in particular, it was a part of
his <HI>&s;econd</HI> Cen&s;us. &startq;The fir&s;t Was in the year when he
him&s;elf was the &s;ixth time, and <HI>M. Agrippa</HI> the &s;e|cond
time Con&s;uls, that is, in the year before the
Chri&s;tian Aera 28. The &s;econd time in the Con&s;ul|&s;hip
of <HI>C. Marcius Cen&s;orinus</HI> and <HI>C. A&s;inius Gallus,</HI>
that is, in the year before the Chri&s;tian Aera 8. And
the la&s;t time in the Con&s;ul&s;hip of <HI>Sextus Pompeius Ne|pos,</HI>
that is, in the year of the Chri&s;tian Aera 14. In
<PB N="333" REF="351">
the fir&s;t and la&s;t time he executed this with the a&s;&s;i|&s;tance
of a Collegue. But the &s;econd time he did it
by him&s;elf alone, and this is the de&s;cription which
St. <HI>Luke</HI> refers to. The Decree concerning it was i&s;|&s;ued
out the year I have mentioned, that is, in the
8th year of the Chri&s;tian Aera, which was three years
before that in which Chri&s;t was born.&mdash;That we
allow three years for the execution of this decree, can
give no ju&s;t rea&s;on for exception.&mdash;The account
taken by the decree of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> at the time of our
Saviour's birth extended to all manner of per&s;ons,
and al&s;o to their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, e&s;tates, qualities, and
other circum&s;tances. And when a de&s;cription and
&s;urvey like this was ordered by <HI>William</HI> the Conque|ror,
to be taken for <HI>England</HI> only, I mean that of
the <HI>Doom&s;day</HI> Book, it was &s;ix years in making; and

<P>(2.) THE years which the Doctor mentions were not
the years, in which the decrees were i&s;&s;ued out, but in
which the &s;urveys was fini&s;hed. This appears to me
<PB N="334" REF="352">
the mo&s;t natural meaning of the words of the in&s;crip|tion.</P>
<P>PERHAPS it will be objected, that the con&s;ul&s;hips
here &s;et down do not denote the years, in which a cen|&s;us
was fini&s;hed, but in which it was re&s;olved upon and
entered in the <HI>Fa&s;ti,</HI> or Public Acts; and that the &s;en&s;e
of the in&s;cription may be thus: In &s;uch, and &s;uch a
Con&s;ul&s;hip I made a cen&s;us, by which cen&s;us when fi|ni&s;hed,
the number of Citizens was found to be &s;o and
&s;o. It may be likewi&s;e &s;aid, that the phra&s;e <HI>Lu&s;trum
feci</HI> does not nece&s;&s;arily import the making the <HI>Lu&s;trum,</HI>
which was done when the cen&s;us was over, but that <HI>Lu|&s;trum</HI>
is <HI>here</HI> &s;ynonymous with cen&s;us. And it may be
urged, that when <HI>Lu&s;trum</HI> denotes the &s;olemn &s;acrifice
at the conclu&s;ion of the cen&s;us, the verb <HI>condo</HI> is u&s;ed,
and not <HI>facio,</HI> which we have here.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, that by the account here given of
the <HI>third</HI> cen&s;us we are obliged to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Con|&s;ul&s;hips
here named denote the times, when each cen|&s;us
was fini&s;hed. <HI>Sextus Pompeius</HI> and <HI>Sextus Apuleius,</HI>

only begun, and not fini&s;hed, he could not have &s;et
down on the Table, as he has done, the number of Ci|tizens
which was found in that cen&s;us: Moreover, it is

plain, that the date on the Ancyran Marble &s;ignifies

a <HI>little book (libellum, Breviarium imperii</HI>) written with
his own hand, containing a &s;mall abridgement of the
public taxes, impo&s;ts, and revenues, can be any proof
<PB N="336" REF="354">
that this &s;tate of the empire was formed upon a &s;urvey
made at this time, or indeed, upon any general &s;ur|vey
made at any other time, by virtue of any one &s;in|gle
decree (that is St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s phra&s;e) for the whole em|pire.
This &s;tate which <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had by him of the pub|lic

&s;urveys made at different times. Nay, he might have
in this <HI>Book</HI> the &s;tate of dependent Kingdomes, in &s;ome

it may appear in the progre&s;&s;e of this argument, that
there were &s;everal countries, branches of the <HI>Roman
Empire,</HI> which had never been obliged to a cen&s;us.</P>
<P>BESIDE that there is not found in any ancient Ro|man
hi&s;torian any account of a general cen&s;us of all the
countries and people of the <HI>Roman Empire;</HI> there are
con&s;iderations taken from the nature of the thing, which
render it very improbable, that a general cen&s;us &s;hould
ever have been appointed at one time. The Roman
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ements were always di&s;agreeable things in the pro|vinces,
and often cau&s;ed di&s;turbances. An univer&s;al

of by any of their Emperors.</P>
<P>WHAT is ju&s;t now &s;aid of the difficulty of making a
general &s;urvey at one and the &s;ame time, affects chiefly

what does the term <HI>all</HI> &s;ignifie? I an&s;wer, it was very
nece&s;&s;ary to be added. At the time when St. <HI>Luke</HI>

pretty much of the &s;ame extent. But <HI>Galilee, I$urea,</HI>

&s;hew, that this decree of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> comprehended <HI>Gali|lee,</HI>
the country in which <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> lived. That this was
the intention in adding this term of univer&s;ality, is evi|dent
from St. <HI>Luke's</HI> &s;pecifying immediately afterwards

There mu&s;t have been many &s;urveys of provinces of the

than enough of them. <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI> &s;peaks of it in his
<HI>apology</HI> to the Emperour and the Senate before the mid|dle
of the &s;econd century, <HI>Tertullian</HI> mentions it in &s;e|veral

fact or circum&s;tance relating to the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us,
which was more frequently and more publickly men|tioned
by the Chri&s;tian writers. And yet it was never
conte&s;ted, that I know of, in all antiquity, not even by
the adver&s;aries of the Chri&s;tian Religion. <HI>Julian</HI> &s;peaks
of it as a thing univer&s;ally known. I &s;ubjoyn his words.

&s;ubjects. If you make a doubt of it, I will prove
it by and by. Though it may be as well done now.
For you &s;ay your-&s;elves that he was enrolled with his
father and mother in the time of <HI>Cyreniuss</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Apud Cyril. l. vi. p. 213. ed. Spanh.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>I PRESUME, I have an&s;wered this objection: but it
is upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;peaks of a cen&s;us
or enrollment in <HI>Judea</HI> only. I have not taken up this
interpretation to avoid a difficulty, but becau&s;e I real|ly
think it to be St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s meaning. However, if
St. <HI>Luke</HI> be &s;uppo&s;ed to &s;peak of a general cen&s;us of the
<HI>Roman Empire,</HI> I own it, that the &s;ilence of antiquity
would be a very great objection. Nor is the difficulty
much le&s;&s;ened by &s;uppo&s;ing this enrollement was of per|&s;ons
only, and not of lands or goods. The numbring
the people was far from being the principal de&s;ign of a
cen&s;us of Roman Citizens. But yet, oftentimes, when
an hi&s;torian mentions a cen&s;us, he gives very little ac|count
of any thing relating to it, be&s;ide the number of
Citizens that was found. If ever the number of all the
people of the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> had been taken in the reign
of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> it would have been a very great curio&s;ity;
and hi&s;torians would have been very fond of gratifying
their readers with it. Though we have but few wri|ters
of tho&s;e times, yet it is with me unque&s;tionable,
that in &s;ome of tho&s;e we have, there would have been
a particular account of &s;o remarkable an event, or
at le&s;t many references to it: whereas there are none
at all.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. ST. <HI>Matthew</HI> &s;ays, that Je&s;us was born in the
days of <HI>Herod. Judea</HI> therefore was not at that time
a Roman Province: and there could be no taxing made
there by virtue of a Decree of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>THIS objection has been an&s;wered already. For it
is evident from what has been alleged from the Chri|&s;tian
writers in the reply to the former objection, that
<PB N="343" REF="361">
there was &s;ome cen&s;us, de&s;cription, or &s;urvey made in

a tax or duty upon a people. In the margin of our

to their families.&endq;</P>
<P>OTHERS have thought, that this decree obliged to
a regi&s;try not only of the names of per&s;ons and their
conditions of life, but al&s;o of their goods and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;i|ons;
and that in &s;hort, it was a Roman cen&s;us which
was now made, in order to the peoples paying taxes
for the future, according to the value of their e&s;tates.

<LIST>
<ITEM>1. I SHALL explain the nature of a Roman cen&s;us.</ITEM>
<ITEM>2. I SHALL con&s;ider the force of St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s words.</ITEM>

that a Roman cen&s;us was made in <HI>Judea</HI> at this
time.</ITEM>
</LIST>
<P>1. I SHALL explain the nature of a Roman cen&s;us.
A cen&s;us (as I take it) con&s;i&s;ted of the&s;e two parts: <HI>fir&s;t,</HI>
the account which the people gave in of them&s;elves and
their e&s;tates; and <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> the value &s;et upon their e&s;tates
by the cen&s;ors, who took: the account from them. The
people did undoubtedly repre&s;ent in &s;ome mea&s;ure the
value of the things they entered; but the Cen&s;ors &s;eem
to have had the power of determining and &s;etling the
value.</P>
<P>THERE was indeed another thing which belonged to
the office of the Cen&s;ors at <HI>Rome,</HI> &s;c. the cen&s;ure or cor|rection
of manners: but, as I &s;uppo&s;e that belonged on|ly
to a cen&s;us of Roman Citizens, and that it was no
part of a cen&s;us of all the inhabitants of a province, or
of a country &s;ubject to a dependent Prince, I take no
notice of it here.</P>
<P>THE Roman cen&s;us was an in&s;titution of <HI>Servius Tul|lius,</HI>
the &s;ixth King of <HI>Rome. Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Hallicarna&s;|&s;us</HI>
gives us this account of it; that &startq;He ordered all
the Citizens of <HI>Rome</HI> to regi&s;ter their e&s;tates accord|ing
to their value in money, taking an oath, in a
form he pre&s;cribed, to deliver a faithful account ac|cording
to the be&s;t of their knowledge, &s;pecifying
withal the name of their parents, their own age, and
the names of their wives and children, adding al&s;o
what quarter of the City, or what town in the coun|try,
they lived in<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Diony&s;. Hal. Ant. Rom. L. iv. c. 15. p. 212. init. Hud&s;. Edit.</NOTE></P>

<P>THAT the reader may have a compleat idea of the
de&s;ign of the&s;e enrolments among the <HI>Romans,</HI> at le&s;t
&s;o far as is nece&s;&s;ary to our purpo&s;e; I &s;hall add here
the account which <HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> has given of the cen&s;us
made by <HI>Laertius</HI> the Dictator, A. U. 258. before
Chri&s;t, 496. Being cho&s;en Dictator, &startq;He immediate|ly
ordered, that all, according to the excellent in&s;ti|tution
of <HI>Servius Tullius,</HI> &s;hould in their &s;everal tribes
give in an account of their e&s;tates, &s;etting down the
names of their wives and children, and their own age
and that of their children. All having in a &s;hort time
offered them&s;elves to be a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed (for the penalty of
neglect was no le&s;s than forfeiture of e&s;tate and citi|zen&s;hip)
there were found to be one hundred fifty
thou&s;and and &s;even hundred <HI>Romans</HI> at man's e&s;tate.
After this, he &s;eparated tho&s;e who were of military
age from the elder; and di&s;po&s;ing tho&s;e into centu|ries,
he formed four bodies of hor&s;e and<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> lib. 5. c. 75. p. 324.</NOTE> foot.&endq;
<PB N="347" REF="365">
From this pa&s;&s;age it appears, that the knowledge of the
military &s;trength of the &s;tate was intended in this in&s;titu|tion,
as well as the regulating the public revenue. It
was nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve this here, that the reader may
the better judge of &s;ome arguments that follow.</P>
<P>2. WE &s;hall now con&s;ider the force and import of
the words St. <HI>Luke</HI> makes u&s;e of in his account of the
matter before us.</P>
<P>Now it mu&s;t be allowed, that the verb made u&s;e of
by St. <HI>Luke</HI> in the fir&s;t ver&s;e, <HI>that all &s;hould be taxed</HI> or
enrolled<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE>, is u&s;ed by <HI>Greek</HI> authors, for the making
any kind of entry or enrolment. Thus <HI>Servius Tullius</HI>
ob&s;erving many Roman Citizens to be in debt, ordered
all of them who had not where-withal to &s;atisfie their
creditors to enter<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Diony&s;. Hal. L. iv. c. 10. p. 207.</NOTE> their names and the &s;um they
owed in public rolls, that it might be known what the
whole amounted to, and provi&s;ion might be made for
payment.</P>
<P>THIS word is likewi&s;e u&s;ed concerning the enrol|ments
which were made, when the Roman Citizens
gave in their names and inli&s;ted them&s;elves in the
&s;ervice of a General<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Dion. Hal. Lib. x. cap. 16. init.</NOTE></P>
<P>So that perhaps there may be &s;ome rea&s;on to que|&s;tion,
whether St. <HI>Luke</HI> intended not a bare entry or
enrolment made by the people of <HI>Judea,</HI> of their names
and condition of life, as many learned men have &s;up|po&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="366">
BUT yet on the other hand, it is certain, that the
whole of a cen&s;us is oftentimes expre&s;&s;ed by the <HI>Greek</HI>
authors, by the words which St. <HI>Luke</HI> has u&s;ed. Thus
<HI>Dio Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> &s;peaking of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s fir&s;t cen&s;us, &s;ays, &startq;in
the &s;ame year he fini&s;hed<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Dio. L. 53. p. 496. c. ad A. U. C. 726.&mdash;vid. etiam p. 512. B <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> (&s;c. Gallorum) <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> the enrolments.&endq; Here|by
meaning, the whole of a cen&s;us, including al&s;o the
cen&s;ure of manners, which belonged to a cen&s;us of Ro|man
Citizens. And in another place, when he parti|cularly
de&s;cribes the office of a Cen&s;or, he &s;ays: &startq;As
Cen&s;ors, they [<HI>the Emperours</HI>] enquire<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> id. L. 53. P. 508. B. C.</NOTE> into our
lives and manners and make enrolments.&endq; He intends
therefore in this place the whole of a cen&s;us, except the
correction of manners, by the noun, which St. <HI>Luke</HI>
makes u&s;e of in the &s;econd ver&s;e: only it is in the plu|ral
number.</P>
<P>FARTHER St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s narration contains in it &s;o ma|ny
circum&s;tances of a Roman cen&s;us, that I cannot but
think, there was at this time a proper cen&s;us. The &s;ub|&s;tance
of the decree was, that all the land &s;hould be
enrolled. Again, <HI>All went to be taxed,</HI> or enrolled. And
he intimates very plainly, that <HI>Mary</HI> al&s;o was enrolled
with <HI>Jo&s;eph.</HI> All the&s;e are particulars extremely agree|able
to the nature of a Roman cen&s;us.</P>
<P>THOUGH therefore the words in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and e&s;pe|cially
the verb in the fir&s;t ver&s;e, is u&s;ed for the making
of any kind of entry, yet the whole relation obliges us
to under&s;tand it concerning this particular kind of en|rolment.</P>
<P>AND St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s words appear to be extremely pro|per.
The edicts for a cen&s;us &s;eem to have generally run
in this form, expre&s;&s;ing the duty of the people. There
is in <HI>Cicero</HI> the title of &s;uch an edict, publi&s;hed by <HI>Ver|res</HI>
Praetor of <HI>Sicilie,</HI> when a cen&s;us was to be made in
<PB N="349" REF="367">
that Province. It is called an EDICT concerning the
ENROLMENT<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">EDICTUM DE PROFESSIONE. Cic. in Verr. lib. iii. n. 26.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN a cen&s;us of the Citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> the number of
the people was always taken and ob&s;erved, but there
was a cen&s;us made of goods and lands, as well as of per|&s;ons.
This appears from pa&s;&s;ages already quoted from
<HI>Diony&s;ius</HI> of <HI>Halicarna&s;&s;us</HI> and others. And <HI>Livie</HI> &s;ays
expre&s;sly, that the very de&s;ign of the in&s;titution was,
that people might contribute to the expen&s;es of the &s;tate
not by the Head, but in proportion to their e&s;tates<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Ut quemadmodum Numa divini auctor juris &s;ui&s;&s;et, ita Servium conditorem omnis in civitate di&s;criminis, ordinumque, quibus inter gradus dignitatis FORTUNAEQUE aliquid interlucet, po&s;teri fama fer|rent: Cen&s;um enim in&s;tituit, rem &s;aluberrimam tanto futuro imperio: ex quo belli paci&s;que munia NON VIRITIM, SED PRO HABITU PE|CUNIARUM, FIERENT.

<P>AND for aught that appears, the &s;ame views were
pur&s;ued in the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ements made in the provinces. <HI>Ta|citus</HI>

infer from hence that there might be enrolments made,

conditions of life; in order to know what number of
troops it might furni&s;h the &s;tate with.</P>
<P>THIS is very po&s;&s;ible, and I think not unlikely.
Tho' I have not yet &s;een any particular in&s;tance of it re|ferred
to by learned men upon this occa&s;ion. Some how|ever
do &s;uppo&s;e that the &s;urvey of <HI>Judea</HI> at this time
was made by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> with this very view<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Breviario igitur quod meditabatur Augu&s;tus, quantum militum Judaea &s;uppeditare po&s;&s;et, includi debuit, Ba&s;nage. Ann. Polit. Ecc. ante D. 5. n. 11.</NOTE> But I be|lieve
<HI>Judea</HI> was the la&s;t place in which the <HI>Romans</HI> would
look for &s;oldiers. The <HI>Jews</HI> had formerly &s;erved the
Kings of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Egypt</HI> in their wars; they had like|wi&s;e
<PB N="350" REF="368">
been in the Roman armies. But now they had
&s;cruples about &s;erving <HI>Heathens</HI> in this way. And all
of them who were in the &s;ervice of the <HI>Romans</HI> had been
di&s;charged in form<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. Ant. lib. xiv. cap. 10. &sect;. 12.</NOTE> Their own Kings kept foreign
troops in <HI>Judea.</HI> After the conque&s;t of <HI>Egypt, Augu&s;tus</HI>
made <HI>Herod</HI> a pre&s;ent of four hundred <HI>Gauls</HI> that had
been the Life Guard of <HI>Cleopatra</HI> Queen of <HI>Egypt</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Id. de B. J. lib. i. p 1006. 15.</NOTE>.
And in the de&s;cription of <HI>Herod</HI>'s funeral &s;olemnity,
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> reckons up three di&s;tinct corps of foreign &s;ol|diers,
<HI>Thracians, Germans,</HI> and <HI>Gauls</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ibid cap. ult. &s;ub &s;in.</NOTE> Indeed the
<HI>Jews</HI> were at this time &s;o &s;elf-willed and tumultuous,
that (as it &s;eems) no Prince was very forward to put
weapons into their hands.</P>
<P>I RECOLLECT but one in&s;tance that looks like a
de&s;ign of any of the Roman Emperours to take <HI>Jews</HI>
into their &s;ervice. This was in the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI>
who, as <HI>Suetonius</HI> &s;ays, &s;ent the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> youth (who were
at <HI>Rome)</HI> under a &s;ort of military oath into the more
unhealthful provinces<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Judaeorum juverntutem, per &s;peciem &s;acramenti, in provincias gravioris coeli di&s;tribut. vit. Tiber, c. 36. vid. &amp; Tacit. Ann. ii. c. 85.</NOTE>. But this &s;eems to me to have
been more like lending them to the mines, than taking
them into military &s;ervice. We are certain the <HI>Jews</HI>
did afterward pay tribute to the <HI>Romans.</HI> And perhaps
I may hereafter make it appear they were now, and
had been before this, tributary to the <HI>Romans.</HI> It is
therefore much more likely, that &s;urveys &s;hould be
made in <HI>Judea</HI> with a view to tribute than to military
&s;ervice.</P>
<P>NOR do I perceive, what learned men gain by this.
They think it di&s;honourable to <HI>Herod</HI> to have the goods
of his Subjects enrolled and rated by a Roman officer
for the paying of tribute. But where lies the difference
between this, and the numbring and entering his peo|ple
in order to demand for &s;oldiers as many men as his
country could afford? If indeed this enrolment of his
people had been made by <HI>Herod,</HI> by his own authority,
<PB N="351" REF="369">
and at his own di&s;cretion, in order to furni&s;h the Empe|rour
with a certain quota of men upon occa&s;ion, <HI>He|rod</HI>'s
honour had been &s;aved. But this is not St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s
account. <HI>There went out a decree from</HI> Ce&s;ar Augu&s;tus,
<HI>that all the land &s;hould be taxed.</HI> And by virtue of this
decree of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> all <HI>Herod</HI>'s &s;ubjects, men and wo|men,
in every part of his dominions, were enrolled, with
great exactne&s;&s;e, and as it &s;eems with great expedition.
And the order of enrolment mu&s;t have been very pre&s;|&s;ing.
I do not &s;uppo&s;e indeed, that the Virgin was
obliged at all by the decree to go to <HI>Bethlehem:</HI> But I
think, that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> would not have gone thither, when
&s;he was &s;o near the time of her delivery, if the enrol|ment
would have admitted of a delay, or could have
been done at another time.</P>
<P>AND that this enrolment was performed by &s;ome
Roman officer, as well as ordered by an Imperial de|cree,
may be very fairly concluded from the parenthe|&s;is,
<HI>ver.</HI> 2. Since the main intention of it is to di&s;tin|gui&s;h
it from another, which was certainly made by a
Roman Officer.</P>
<P>MR. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> indeed &s;ays, <HI>It is very probable that the
enrolment of the</HI> Jews <HI>was made by</HI> Herod, <HI>at the reque&s;t
of</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Short view of the Harm. of the four Evang. p. 149.</NOTE> Augu&s;tus. It would have been to Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s
purpo&s;e to give a few &s;pecimens of this &s;tile <HI>of Augu&s;tus</HI>
or of the Republic toward &s;ome of their dependent no|minal
Kings. But it would not have &s;ignified much in
this ca&s;e, becau&s;e St. <HI>Luke</HI> does not &s;ay, <HI>there went out</HI>
a reque&s;t from <HI>Ce&s;ar Augu&s;tus,</HI> but a <HI>Decree.</HI> And there|fore
we &s;hould have been &s;till obliged to call it a <HI>decree.</HI>
And I believe, we may do &s;o very &s;afely. We &s;hall find
by and by, from the hi&s;tory of <HI>Herod,</HI> that it is very
unlikely that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> &s;hould have &s;ent <HI>Herod</HI> any <HI>re|que&s;ts</HI>
about this time.</P>
<P>AGAIN: Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> &s;uppo&s;es <HI>that</HI> Herod <HI>the King
of the</HI> Jews <HI>was reque&s;ted or required to get him</HI> [Augu|&s;tus]
<HI>a like exact account of the jewi&s;h nation, as he had
already attained of the re&s;t of the Roman Empire.</HI> But if
<PB N="352" REF="370">
this had been all that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> did, namely, <HI>requiring</HI>
or <HI>reque&s;ting</HI> this of <HI>Herod,</HI> then <HI>Herod</HI> mu&s;t have i&s;&s;ued
a command or order to all his people to enrolle them|&s;elves.
But how came St. <HI>Luke</HI> to mention <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s
requirement or reque&s;t to <HI>Herod,</HI> and call it a decree
too, and yet &s;ay nothing of <HI>Herod</HI>'s order? I think,
St. <HI>Luke</HI> does plainly repre&s;ent the people of <HI>Judea</HI> in
motion for enrolling them&s;elves in their &s;everal cities in
obedience to <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s decree; and he &s;ays nothing of

even from the&s;e words it appears, that an account was
taken of the e&s;tates of the people, as well as their
names and conditions of life. And the Cen&s;ors mu&s;t
have made an e&s;timation: Otherwi&s;e the value could
never have been known with any certainty. Be&s;ides I
think, that all the Emperour intends here, is, that he
could ea&s;ily conceive with what difficulty a cen&s;us was
at fir&s;t introduced into a province, when even now a
fre&s;h cen&s;us was &s;eldom made without &s;ome disturbance.
And as a proof of this, he in&s;tances in the rebellion,
which the fir&s;t cen&s;us of <HI>Gaul</HI> produced in that coun|try
<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Livie</HI> &s;peaks likewi&s;e of this di&s;turbance. Tumultus, qui ob cen&s;um exortus erat, compo&s;t|tus. <HI>Epitome libri</HI> 137. <HI>Liviani.</HI></NOTE> And tho' he calls this renewing a cen&s;us, only an
inquiry that his e&s;tate or revenue might be publickly
known: yet certainly the tribute to be paid according
<PB N="353" REF="371">
to the cen&s;us is not to be excluded. Princes do not,
nor is it rea&s;onable they &s;hould, reckon their people on|ly,
all their riches. The revenue ari&s;ing from the tri|bute
or taxes which they pay is certainly a part of the
Prince's riches. The Emperour's meaning therefore is,
that the making of a cen&s;us now is not the impo&s;ing any
new hard&s;hip: the great u&s;e of them is to pre&s;erve ex|actne&s;&s;e
and order in the &s;tate of the revenues; and yet
they give people unea&s;ine&s;&s;e: How much more mu&s;t
they have done &s;o formerly?</P>
<P>MOREOVER, the taxing afterwards made in <HI>Judea</HI>
was certainly a cen&s;us of goods as well as per&s;ons. And
yet when St. <HI>Luke</HI> makes mention of it in <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Act. v. 37.</NOTE>
&s;peech, he u&s;es the &s;ame words he does here.</P>
<P>ALL the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians thought this was a cen&s;us of
goods. It is apparent that <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI> thought &s;o,
in that he tells the Emperour and the Senate, it was
made by their fir&s;t procurator in <HI>Judea. Tertullian</HI>
makes no &s;cruple to call it very plainly a cen&s;us. And
<HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> in his chronicle &s;ays expre&s;ly, that enrolments
were then made of goods as well as of per&s;ons. All
the&s;e con&s;iderations, if I mi&s;take not, render it highly
probable, that according to St. <HI>Luke,</HI> there was now a
proper cen&s;us made in <HI>Judea</HI> throughout the territories
of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>BUT though it be &s;uppo&s;ed, that here was now a
cen&s;us made, yet a cen&s;us is not a tax. A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ements
were certainly made, that tribute might be paid accor|ding
to them: and where a cen&s;us was made, a tribute
might be required. But yet it might be forbore or re|mitted.
And whether any tribute was rai&s;ed upon this
cen&s;us or not, I leave at pre&s;ent undetermined.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING the affair St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives us an account
of to have been a Roman cen&s;us, it is po&s;&s;ible two or
there enquiries may be here made. (1.) What occa|&s;ion
was there for <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> to enrolle him&s;elf, &s;ince he was
a poor man; as may be concluded from the le&s;&s;er of|fering,
<PB N="354" REF="372">
which the Virgin made at the temple for her
purification?</P>
<P>I an&s;wer, that it was the cu&s;tom in a Roman cen&s;us,
for per&s;ons of all employments and characters to enter
them&s;elves; as appears from the de&s;criptions given of it,
in the authors which I have before quoted. And tho'
<HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was not a rich man, it does not follow he had no|thing.
However, whatever his condition was, the edict
obliged him to give in an account of him&s;elf to the offi|cers,
unle&s;s there was a particular exception made, and
only &s;uch per&s;ons were required to appear who were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of e&s;tates to &s;uch a value. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> &s;eems once
to have made &s;uch a cen&s;us of the Roman citizens<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Dio. l. 55. p. 557. B.</NOTE>.
But that this was not the u&s;ual method, is evident, be|cau&s;e
this particular circum&s;tance of that cen&s;us is men|tioned
as &s;omewhat extraordinary.</P>
<P>(2.) SINCE <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> lived in <HI>Galilee,</HI> how came he to
go up from thence to be regi&s;tred at <HI>Bethlehem?</HI></P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, that po&s;&s;ibly he might be obliged
to it by virtue of &s;ome clau&s;e in the Edict. <HI>Ulpian</HI> &s;ays<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Is ver&ograve; qui agrum in ali&acirc; civitate habet, in e&acirc; civitate profiteri debet, in qu&acirc; ager e&s;t. Agri enim tributum in eam civitatem debet levare, in cujus territorio po&s;&s;idetur. l. 4. &sect;. 2. ff. de cen&s;ibus.</NOTE>,
that per&s;ons ought to enrolle them&s;elves in the place
where their e&s;tate lies. Though <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was not rich,
yet he might have &s;ome &s;mall inheritance in or near
<HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and might be obliged to go thither upon
that account. But this I do not in&s;i&s;t upon here.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> gives us this rea&s;on of his going to <HI>Bethle|hem:
becau&s;e he was of the hou&s;e and linage of David,</HI> v. 4.
It is probable, that this journey was owing to the cu|&s;tom
of the <HI>Jews,</HI> who, whenever they were numbered,
entred them&s;elves according to their tribes and families.
If again&s;t this it be objected, That the <HI>Jews</HI> had lo&s;t
the regi&s;ters of their families before this time: I an|&s;wer,
that this does not appear. They were reckoned
<PB N="355" REF="373">
by them to be of great importance. And it is not un|likely,
that many, if not mo&s;t of them, had the regi&s;ters
of their families till the final ruine of their &s;tate and con|&s;titution,
and perhaps for &s;ome time after it. <HI>Anna</HI> is
&s;aid to be the <HI>daughter</HI> of Phanuel, <HI>of the</HI> TRIBE OF AS|SER,
<HI>Luke</HI> ii. 36. <HI>Barnabas</HI> was a LEVITE, <HI>Acts</HI> iv. 36.
<HI>Paul</HI> affirms, that he was of the TRIBE OF BENJAMIN,
<HI>Rom.</HI> xi. 1. Phil. iii. 5. And the&s;e two were born in fo|reign
countries, the one in <HI>Cyprus,</HI> the other at <HI>Tar&s;us.</HI></P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS,</HI> the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> Hi&s;torian, having men|tioned
the time of his birth, and the names of &s;everal of
his ance&s;tors; &s;ays, &startq;Thus have I given an account of
my family,&endq; as I found it in the publick records<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Jo&s;eph. in vit. init.</NOTE>.
It is true, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was of the race of the prie&s;ts, and
their regi&s;ters might be kept with greater care and ex|actne&s;&s;e
than others: But it is evident from what he
&s;ays of the marriages of the prie&s;ts, that the regi&s;ters
of other families were in being likewi&s;e. &startq;Every prie&s;t,
<HI>&s;ays he,</HI> among us is obliged to marry a woman of his
own nation, and not &s;o much to regard money or any
other advantages, but to make an exact enquiry into
her de&s;cent, and to accept of no account but what is
well atte&s;ted. This is done not in <HI>Judea</HI> only, but
in all places, where-ever there is any part of our
nation, this law relating to the marriages of the
prie&s;ts is mo&s;t carefully ob&s;erved; I mean, in <HI>Egypt</HI>
and <HI>Babylon,</HI> and every other part of the world, in
which any of our prie&s;ts live<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Cont. Apion, l. i. &sect;. 7.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>(3.) WHAT nece&s;&s;ity was there, for the Virgin <HI>Mary</HI>
to go to <HI>Bethlehem?</HI> Surely every ma&s;ter of a fa|mily
was not obliged by a Roman cen&s;us, to appear
<PB N="356" REF="374">
before the officer, with his wife, children and &s;ervants,
if he had any.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that I know not of any obligation &s;he
was under by virtue of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s edict to go to <HI>Bethle|hem</HI>
at this time: But yet <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> might
choo&s;e it. And they might have very good rea&s;ons for
it that we are unacquainted with. St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Ch.</HI> ii.
41, 42. <HI>Now his parents went to</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>every year,
at the fea&s;t of the Pa&s;&s;over. And when he was twelve
years old, they went up to</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>after the cu&s;tom of
the fea&s;t.</HI> And yet by the law of <HI>Mo&s;es,</HI> the males only
were obliged to appear before God at the great fea&s;ts.
And many learned men are of opinion, that our Saviour
did not go up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> till this pa&s;&s;over (which
St. <HI>Luke</HI> here &s;peaks of) when he was <HI>twelve years</HI> of
age: though his Parents, <HI>Mary,</HI> as it &s;eems, as well as
<HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> had gone up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> every year; <HI>i. e.</HI> from
their la&s;t &s;ettlement in <HI>Galilee,</HI> after their return from
<HI>Egypt.</HI></P>
<P>3. I SHALL now give a general de&s;cription of the
&s;tate and condition of <HI>Judea</HI> under <HI>Herod,</HI> that we may
be able to judge whether a Roman cen&s;us could be made
in it by virtue of a decree of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>THE <HI>Roman Empire</HI> extended at this time to all the
mo&s;t con&s;iderable countries of the known world, whe|ther
&s;ituated in <HI>Europe, A&s;ia,</HI> or <HI>Africa.</HI> Be&s;ide tho&s;e
countries which were properly called provinces, and
were governed by officers &s;ent from <HI>Rome,</HI> with the ti|tle
of Pre&s;idents, Praetors, or Procon&s;uls; there were
other countries governed by Kings, Tetrarchs or Dy|na&s;ts,
dependent upon the Roman State.</P>
<P>IN the &s;tate and condition of the&s;e dependent Princes,
there was a con&s;iderable difference. Some few received
their crown from the Emperour, and acknowledged a
dependence, but paid no tribute<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Appian. in Prae&s;. init.</NOTE>; among the re&s;t, who
were in a more proper &s;ubjection, &s;ome were call'd Friends
of the Emperour or the Roman State. This was undoubt|edly
<PB N="357" REF="375">
a very great honour, e&s;pecially when conferred in
form<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Cognitis dehinc Ptolemaci per id bellum &s;tudiis, repetitus ex veta&s;to mos, mi&s;&s;uquc &egrave; &s;enatoribus qui &s;cipionem eburnum, togam pictam, antiqua munera patrum daret, <HI>regemque &amp; &s;ocium, atque ami|cum</HI> appellaret.

with a part of their troops, or with &s;ums of money
upon particular occa&s;ions; or made pre&s;ents to the
Emperour and his mini&s;ters, when needful. That is,
they paid tribute in the genteele&s;t way. Others were
more properly tributary, and were obliged to the pay|ment
of certain &s;ums of money: but it is generally &s;up|po&s;ed
that they rai&s;ed it them&s;elves among their people
by their own officers. But I &s;u&s;pect that many of tho&s;e
princes, called Friends, were properly tributary, and
that the Emperour had an officer in the territories of
mo&s;t of them who took care of his revenue. Be&s;ide the&s;e,
there were (if I mi&s;take not) &s;ome countries under the
government of dependent Kings, in which a tribute was
rai&s;ed in the way of a Roman cen&s;us.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Herod</HI> was a dependent Prince, I think was
never denied. He obtained the kingdome of <HI>Judea</HI> at
fir&s;t by virtue of a decree of the Roman<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. de Bel. l. i. cap. 14. fin.</NOTE> Senate;
and was a&s;&s;i&s;ted in taking po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it by Roman
troops commanded by their own<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 18.</NOTE> officers. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>
gave him leave to nominate for his &s;ucce&s;&s;or which of
his &s;ons he plea&s;ed. But yet in his la&s;t will there was a
clau&s;e, by which the final determination of all was &s;ub|mitted
to the will and plea&s;ure of the Emperour. And
after his death his &s;ons were obliged to go to <HI>Rome</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">De Bel. lib. ii. cap. 2.</NOTE>
to obtain the grant and confirmation of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> be|fore
they dared to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the territories a&s;|&s;ined
them by their father.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Herod</HI> was tributary to <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> immediate|ly
before his death, &s;eems evident from the &s;entence pro|nounced
by the Emperour after he had con&s;idered <HI>He|rod</HI>'s
will. &startq;To <HI>Archelaus</HI> were given, <HI>&s;ays Jo&s;ephus,

The&s;e were ea&s;ed of a fourth part of their tri|bute.

had not joined with the other people in their late di|&s;turbances
<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Jo&s;eph. Ant. l. 17. c xiii. &sect;. 4. vid. &amp; de Bell. l. ii. c. vi.</NOTE>.&endq; I think it mo&s;t rea&s;onable to under|&s;tand
this of a tribute paid, or to be paid, not to <HI>Herod</HI>
or <HI>Achearus,</HI> but to the Emperour. If the <HI>Samaritans</HI>
were tributary to <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> the <HI>Jews</HI> were &s;o likewi&s;e. It
is plain the&s;e were not more favoured than the former.
And they were both equally &s;ubject to <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Ar|chelaus.</HI></P>
<P>THAT <HI>Herod</HI> had been always tributary to the <HI>Ro|man
Empire,</HI> may be inferred from what <HI>Agrippa</HI> the
younger &s;ays to the <HI>Jews</HI> in his &s;peech to di&s;&s;wade
them from the war. &startq;At this time, <HI>&s;ays he,</HI> the de|&s;ire

yielded to a &s;mall part of the Roman power.

very good friends, and it cannot be &s;uppo&s;ed that
<HI>Herod</HI> was better u&s;ed by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> than he had been by
<HI>Antony.</HI></P>
<P>IN the &s;tory of the difference between <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Syl|laeus</HI>
the <HI>Arabian,</HI> which difference &s;eems to have aro&s;e
about three years before <HI>Herod</HI>'s death, and to have
continued a year or two at le&s;t, if not as long as <HI>Herod</HI>
lived, there is a pa&s;&s;age that de&s;erves to be ob&s;erved
in this place. &startq;<HI>Syllaeus</HI> moreover bribed <HI>Fabatus,
Ce&s;ar</HI>'s Procurator, and employ'd him again&s;t <HI>He|rod.</HI>
But <HI>Herod</HI> by a larger &s;um of money drew off
<HI>Fabatus</HI> from <HI>Syllaeus,</HI> and by him required the per|formance
of tho&s;e things which <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> had ordered [<HI>to
be done by Syllaeus</HI>]. However <HI>Syllaeus</HI> went on in his
old way, performed none of tho&s;e things; and more|over
accu&s;ed <HI>Fabatus</HI> to <HI>Cae&s;ar,</HI> &s;aying, that he was a
Procurator more in <HI>Herod</HI>'s intere&s;ts than the Empe|rour's
<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Jo&s;eph, de Bell. l. 1. c. 29. p. 1030. v. 21.&mdash;</NOTE>.&endq; By <HI>Procurator</HI> can be meant no other
than an officer that took care of the Emperour's reve|nue.
And the nature of the charge &s;eems to imply,
<PB N="360" REF="378">
that <HI>Fabatus</HI> had a tru&s;t under the Emperour in <HI>Herod</HI>'s
dominions. This indeed may be que&s;tioned, becau&s;e
that afterwards, <HI>Syllacus</HI> having killed <HI>Fabatus, Aretas</HI>
the King of <HI>Arabia</HI> pro&s;ecuted <HI>Syllaeus</HI> at <HI>Rome</HI> for the
murder of <HI>Fabatus,</HI> as well as for other crimes commit|ted
by him<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jo&s;eph. Ant. lib. xvii. cap. 3.</NOTE> And from hence it may be inferred
by &s;ome, that <HI>Fabatus</HI> was rather an officer in <HI>Arabia.</HI>
Let it be &s;o. However, here is a proof, that the Em|perour
had a Procurator to take care of his tribute or re|venue
in the country of a dependent Prince: for &s;uch
was the King of <HI>Arabia.</HI> And it is not impo&s;&s;ible, that
<HI>Fabatus</HI> might be concerned in both tho&s;e Kingdoms,
of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Arabia.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the whole then, <HI>Herod</HI> was always a depen|dent
tributary Prince. Whether he was at la&s;t obliged
to &s;ubmit to a cen&s;us, will be the &s;ubject of enquiry
under the next head.</P>
<P>ALL that I would &s;hew farther here is, that a cen&s;us
was not incon&s;i&s;tent with the rights allowed to the&s;e de|pendent
Princes, according to the Roman con&s;titution.
This is generally denied, therefore &s;ome proof mu&s;t be
given of it. But it cannot be expected, that I &s;hould
produce many examples of a cen&s;us in dependent king|doms:
partly, becau&s;e the Roman Hi&s;torians never
take any notice of the&s;e things, unle&s;s they are attend|ed
with &s;ome accidents that render them remarkable:
and partly, becau&s;e the <HI>Romans</HI> had &s;everal ways of rai&s;|ing
tribute; and a cen&s;us, which was the mo&s;t di&s;agree|able
way of all, was not u&s;ed in all tho&s;e countries that
were properly provinces.</P>
<P>AFTER the battle of <HI>Philippi,</HI> in which <HI>Brutus</HI> and
<HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI> were defeated, <HI>Mark Antony</HI> went over into <HI>A&s;ia,</HI>
and coming to <HI>Ephe&s;us,</HI> &s;ummoned the States of the na|tions
thereabout to give him a meeting. In a &s;peech
he made to the&s;e States, among other things, he tells
them: &startq;Your King <HI>Attalus</HI> bequeathed his kingdome
to us by te&s;tament. Our government has been milder
than his was. For we remitted the taxes you had
<PB N="361" REF="379">
been wont to pay to him, till men of turbulent &s;pirits
aro&s;e among&s;t us, and laid us under a nece&s;&s;ity of de|manding
tribute of you. And even then we did not
impo&s;e it upon you in the way of a cen&s;us, that we
might collect it with le&s;s hazard and trouble to our
&s;elves, and required only the annual payment of a
&s;um of money out of the produce of your country<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Appian. de Bell. Civ. lib. v. p. 1074.</NOTE>.&endq;
In the conclu&s;ion they agreed to pay a whole nine years
tribute in two years time. The battle of <HI>Philippi</HI> was
fought<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Vid. Petavii Rationarium Temporum Par. i. lib. iv. cap. 20.</NOTE>, A. U. 712. <HI>Attalus</HI> died<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Vid. ibid. cap. 14.</NOTE>, A. U. 621. So
that <HI>A&s;ia</HI> (<HI>Propria</HI>) had been a province 90 years, and
yet they had not had any cen&s;us among them. It is not
likely therefore, that we &s;hould meet with many in|&s;tances
of a cen&s;us made in dependent kingdoms.</P>
<P><HI>TACITUS</HI> however has given us one in&s;tance. &startq;A|bout

and by the advantage of the &s;ituation, maintained

<P>THE only difficulty is, who they were &s;ubject to,
when this cen&s;us was ordered to be made among them
in the latter end of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign. For by the manner,
in which the fir&s;t words of this pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Tacitus</HI> are
quoted by Cardinal <HI>Noris</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Noris Cenotaph. Pi&s;. Di&s;&s;. ii. pag. 308.</NOTE>, and by <HI>Pagi</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Appar. ad annal. num. 127.</NOTE> from

were then <HI>&s;ubject to Archelaus,</HI> a &s;on of the former <HI>Ar|chelaus,</HI>
who died at <HI>Rame,</HI> A. U. 770.</P>
<P>I AM under no obligation to determine this matter,
becau&s;e it is the &s;ame thing to my purpo&s;e, whether they
were now &s;ubject to the King of <HI>Comagene</HI> or &s;ome other
dependent prince, or whether they were &s;ubject to a &s;on

a King. But it &s;eems to me mo&s;t natural to inter|pr&ecirc;t
<HI>Tacitus,</HI> as <HI>Lip&s;ius</HI> does. The <HI>imbelles regis copiae</HI>
imply, that a King had been mentioned before; and
therefore <HI>Archelao &s;ubjecta</HI> cannot be very fairly under|&s;tood
to mean no more than a de&s;cription of the&s;e <HI>Cili|cians,</HI>
to di&s;tingui&s;h them from others of that name.</P>
<P><HI>TIBERIUS</HI> had been indeed very angry with old
<HI>Archelaus.</HI> But neverthele&s;&s;e he might be willing, when
he had made his kingdome of <HI>Cappadocia</HI> a province, to
give one of his &s;ons this &s;mall appendage of it. This
<PB N="364" REF="382">
<HI>Cilicia</HI> was far from being any &s;trong temptation. The
country was mountainous, and the people were apt to
turn to robbery or piracy, and for the&s;e rea&s;ons they had
been given before by <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> to the above-mentioned
<HI>Archelaus</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Vid. Strabo. l. xiv. p. 987. D.</NOTE> <HI>Cappadocia</HI> had been a very rich booty
to <HI>Tiberius.</HI> Upon its being made a province, by the
ready mony and effects of <HI>Archelaus</HI> and the revenues of

&s;uppo&s;e, that by <HI>Archelaus</HI> here is meant a &s;on of the for|mer

<P>THOUGH here be but one example, it is &s;ufficient
for my de&s;ign. I believe it was di&s;graceful to a Prince,
to have a cen&s;us made in his dominions. However,
<HI>Tacitus</HI> does not in&s;inuate, that there was any inju&s;tice
in it, or that it was ab&s;olutely incon&s;i&s;tent with the
rights indulged to dependent Princes: and the King,
to whom this people were &s;ubject, &s;upported this cen|&s;us,

<P>WE can hope for no light in this matter from any
author but <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> except the notice which the Chri|&s;tian
writers have taken of it. If we will rely upon
them, I think the point is decided already: but at pre|&s;ent
we will lay a&s;ide their te&s;timonies, and confine our
enquiries to <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI></P>
<P>THAT <HI>Herod</HI> was always tributary, has been prov|ed.

<PB N="365" REF="383">
for the wor&s;e. In order to judge or the evidence
there is for it, we mu&s;t trace the hi&s;tory of <HI>Herod</HI>'s af|fairs
about this time.</P>
<P><HI>OBODAS</HI> was now King of <HI>Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Syllaeus</HI>
his chief Officer under him, who indeed admini&s;tred all
affairs of that country with almo&s;t kingly authority.
<HI>Herod</HI> had lent <HI>Obodas</HI> a con&s;iderable &s;um of money:
When the time of payment came, <HI>Herod</HI> demanded
the money, but in vain. Moreover a band of robbers
had infected <HI>Herod</HI>'s dominions and carried off &s;everal of
his Subjects, and were afterwards &s;heltered by <HI>Obodas</HI>
and <HI>Syllaeus</HI> in <HI>Arabia.</HI> The&s;e differences between the
two courts of <HI>Judea</HI> and <HI>Arabia</HI> were brought before
<HI>Saturninus</HI> and <HI>Volumnius,</HI> the Emperour's chief officers
in <HI>Syria,</HI> the neighbouring province. Here it was &s;ti|pulated,
that <HI>Herod</HI> &s;hould &s;urrender to <HI>Obodas</HI> all the
<HI>Arabians</HI> he had in his cu&s;tody, and that <HI>Obodas</HI> &s;hould
relea&s;e all <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> pri&s;oners, and pay the money he owed
in thirty days time<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph Ant. lib. xvi. cap. q. p. 734.</NOTE>. But when this time was expir|ed,
none of the&s;e conditions were performed on the
part of the <HI>Arabians.</HI> And <HI>Syllaeus</HI> full of re&s;entment
again&s;t <HI>Herod</HI> &s;ails for <HI>Rome.</HI> The terms agreed upon
not having been performed by <HI>Obodas, Herod,</HI> with the
con&s;ent of <HI>Saturninus</HI> and <HI>Volumnius,</HI> marches into <HI>Ara|bia,</HI>
and routs the forces that oppo&s;ed him. Advice of
this is immediately &s;ent to <HI>Syllaeus</HI> then in <HI>Italic</HI> He
procures an audience of <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> tells him, That
<HI>Herod</HI> had made an incur&s;ion into <HI>Arabia,</HI> laid wa&s;t the
country, and killed five and twenty hundred <HI>Arabians</HI>
with their General. <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> having heard this, en|quires
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s friends at <HI>Rome,</HI> and of per&s;ons who
arrived from <HI>Syria,</HI> whether this was matter of fact.
Being a&s;&s;ured it was, without ever a&s;king the occa&s;ion,
&startq;He writes a letter to <HI>Herod</HI> in very angry terms,<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> id. ibid. p. 735.</NOTE>

the future treat him as a SUBJECT.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>HEROD</HI> then &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors to <HI>Rome:</HI> But
they were forced to return without &s;o much as obtaining
an audience. A &s;econd amba&s;&s;y likewi&s;e went to <HI>Rome</HI>
without any effect<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">P. 736. init.</NOTE></P>
<P>IN the mean time <HI>Obodos</HI> dies, and <HI>Aretas</HI> takes up|on
him the crown of <HI>Arabia:</HI> and then &s;ends away any
ba&s;&s;adours to <HI>Rome,</HI> with large pre&s;ents; withal accu&s;|ing
<HI>Syllaeus,</HI> his predece&s;&s;or's chief mini&s;ter, of many
great crimes. But <HI>Syllaeus</HI> was &s;till in great favour at
<HI>Rome,</HI> and <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was offended, that <HI>Aretas</HI> had ta|ken
upon him the government of <HI>Arabia</HI> without fir&s;t
obtaining his leave. And &s;ent back the amba&s;&s;adours
without receiving the pre&s;ents, or admitting them to an
audience. &startq;The affairs of the&s;e two kingdoms of <HI>Ju|dea</HI>
and <HI>Arabia</HI> were then in a very bad po&s;ture. In
one there was a King not confirmed in his govern|ment.
And <HI>Herod</HI> having lo&s;t the Emperour's favour
was forced to &s;ubmit to many di&s;graces and affronts.
Seeing no end of the&s;e evils, he re&s;olved to &s;end once
more an amba&s;&s;y to <HI>Rome,</HI> and to try whether he
could gain friends there, and by them recover the
Emperour's good will. The per&s;on &s;ent upon this
occa&s;ion was <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. P. 736.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THIS <HI>Nicolas,</HI> who was ever firm to <HI>Herod</HI>'s inte|re&s;t,
was a man of great abilities and of admirable ad|dre&s;&s;e.
When he came to <HI>Rome, Syllaeus</HI>'s power was
declining: New informations again&s;t him had been
brought from <HI>Arabia,</HI> and <HI>Nicolas</HI> artfully joining in
with the <HI>Arabians</HI> procures an audience of <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI>
and having fir&s;t &s;upported the charges brought by
them again&s;t <HI>Syllaeus,</HI> he proceeded to the defen&s;e of
<PB N="367" REF="385">
<HI>Herod.</HI> &startq;Here the Emperour &s;topped him &s;hort, and
bid him an&s;wer, whether <HI>Herod</HI> had not marched his
forces into <HI>Arabia,</HI> and &s;lain five and twenty hundred
men?&endq; To which <HI>Nicolas</HI> replied: That the things
the Emperour had heard concerning <HI>Herod</HI> were in
part true and in part fal&s;e, and that the occa&s;ion of all
had been concealed from him. He informed the Em|perour
of the differences between <HI>Obodas</HI> and <HI>Herod:</HI>
That certain &s;tipulations had been entered into in the
pre&s;ence of <HI>Saturninus</HI> and <HI>Volumnius:</HI> That <HI>Syllaeus</HI> had
&s;worn by the Emperour's Fortune, that the terms
agreed upon &s;hould be punctually executed, but that
nothing had been done: That <HI>Herod</HI> had not moved his
forces, till he had fir&s;t obtained the con&s;ent of the Em|perour's
chief officers in <HI>Syria,</HI> and that the numbers of
the &s;lain had been very much magnified. <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI>
perceiving that his di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t <HI>Herod</HI> had been
built upon mi&s;repre&s;entations, was appea&s;ed; and at
length pronounced a &s;entence, that <HI>Syllaeus</HI> &s;hould re|turn
home, give <HI>Herod</HI> &s;atis&s;action, and then be puni&s;h|ed
for his crimes<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Id. ibid. cap. 10. pag. 740, 741.</NOTE></P>
<P>SOME time after this we have an account of &s;ome
di&s;turbances in <HI>Herod</HI>'s family. A very &s;trict friend&s;hip
had commenced between <HI>Antipater Herod</HI>'s elde&s;t &s;on,
<HI>Pheroras Herod</HI>'s brother, and <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife, who
was particularly di&s;agreeable to <HI>Herod. Salome, He|rod</HI>'s
&s;i&s;ter, who knew almo&s;t every thing, &s;u&s;pected
that the&s;e three were carrying on de&s;igns again&s;t her
brother. She came and told him what &s;he knew; and
<HI>Herod</HI> had had &s;ome intelligence before, and was full
of &s;u&s;picions, but what he had heard was not fully con|firmed.
There follows immediately upon this, a pa&s;|&s;age
of &s;o extraordinary a nature, that it mu&s;t be
tran&s;cribed without any abridgement, &startq;There was
moreover, <HI>&s;ays</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 17. cap. z. &sect;. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> a certain &s;ect of <HI>Jews,</HI>
<PB N="368" REF="386">
who valued them&s;elves highly for their exact know|ledge
of the law; and talking much of their intere&s;t
with God, were greatly in favour with the women.
They are called <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> men who had it in their
power to controle Kings; extremely &s;ubtle, and
ready to attempt any thing again&s;t tho&s;e whom they
did not like. When therefore the whole <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation
took an oath to be faithful to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> and the intere&s;ts
of the King, the&s;e men to the number of above &s;ix
thou&s;and refu&s;ed to &s;wear. The King having laid a
fine upon them, <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife paid the money for
them. They, in requital for this her kindne&s;&s;e (for
they were &s;uppo&s;ed by their great intimacy with God
to have attained to the gift of foreknowledge) fore|told,
that God having decreed to put an end to the
government of <HI>Herod</HI> and his race, the kingdome
would be transferred to her and <HI>Pheroras</HI> and their
children. <HI>Salome,</HI> who was ignorant of none of the&s;e
things, came and told the King of them, and allured
him likewi&s;e, that many of the court were corrupt|ed
by them. Then the King put to death the mod
guilty of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and <HI>Bagoas</HI> the eunuch, and
one <HI>Carus,</HI> the mo&s;t beautiful young man about the
<PB N="369" REF="387">
court, and the great in&s;trument in the King's unlaw|ful
plea&s;ures. He likewi&s;e &s;hew every one in his own
family which adhered to tho&s;e things which were &s;aid
by the <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI> But <HI>Bagoas</HI> had been elevated by
them, in that he &s;hould be called father and benefac|tor,
the King who was to be appointed according to
their prediction (for all things would be in his power)
being to give him a capacity of marriage, and of ha|ving
children of his own.&endq;</P>
<P>IN the margin<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">This pa&s;&s;age of <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has been already quoted very often by learned men, who have treated of this Cen&s;us, or of the true time of our Saviour's nativity. But all, whom I have &s;een, have follow|ed <HI>Gelenius</HI>'s ver&s;ion of the&s;e la&s;t words, which is thus: Nam Ba|goas in eam &s;pem &s;ublatus erat, qua&s;i parens &amp; benefactor appellandus regis, quem de&s;tinarent vaticinia; pro&s;pere enim ce&s;&s;ura novo regi omnia, con&s;tabiliendo &s;ucce&s;&s;ionem prolis legitimae.

Dr. <HI>Hud&s;on</HI> has very much corrected <HI>Gelenius</HI>'s ver&s;ion, and tran&s;lates the concluding words thus: Fuit autem per eos elatus Bagoas, quod di&s;cerent eum patrem beneficumque appella|turn iri ejus, qui ex eorum pracdictione creandus rex e&s;&s;et; habitu|rum enim eum regem omnium rerum pote&s;tatem, &amp; Bagoae vires conciliaturum cum muliere congrediendi. proprio&s;que liberos gignendi.

rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>(1.) As far as I can perceive, this oath mu&s;t have
been taken much about the fame time with the taxing
or cen&s;us mentioned by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> according to all tho&s;e
who place the nativity of Je&s;us &s;ome time between
twelve, or fifteen months and two years before the
death of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) THERE is a great variety of circum&s;tances at|tending
this oath in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> that accord with the hi|&s;tory
the Evangeli&s;ts have given us of the birth of Je&s;us.
I imagine I am very much prevented by the reader, but
I &s;hall &s;pecifie &s;ome of them.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays: <HI>There went out a decree from</HI> CESAR
AUGUSTUS, <HI>that all the land &s;hould be taxed.</HI> The &s;ub|&s;tance
of the oath in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was to <HI>be faithful to</HI> CESAR,
as well as to <HI>Herod.</HI> An oath is a formal acknowledge|ment
of &s;ubjection, as well as an engagement to fidelity,
No greater acknowledgement of &s;ubjection could be
made than an enrolment in a Roman cen&s;us. St. <HI>Luke</HI>
&s;ays, the decree was, that <HI>all the land</HI> &s;hould be taxed,
and that <HI>all went to be taxed. Jo&s;ephus</HI> agrees with him
&s;urpri&s;ingly, when he &s;ays, that <HI>All the jewi&s;h nation</HI> took
the oath, except &s;ix thou&s;and <HI>Phari&s;ees.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="371" REF="389">
ST. <HI>Luke</HI>'s <HI>Taxing</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;ephu</HI>'s <HI>Oath</HI> are followed
with parallel events. When the wi&s;e men came, &s;aying:
<HI>Where is he that is born King of the Jews?</HI> Herod <HI>was
troubled and all</HI> Jeru&s;alem <HI>with him. Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s account
is a perfect comment upon St. <HI>Matthew.</HI> St. <HI>Matthew</HI>
&s;ays: <HI>When he</HI> [Herod] <HI>had gathered the</HI> CHIEF PRIESTS
AND SCRIBES <HI>of the people together, he demanded of them
where</HI> CHRIST <HI>should be born. And they &s;aid unto him,
in</HI>
Bethlehem <HI>of</HI> Judea: <HI>for thus it is written by the</HI> PROPHET;
<HI>and thou</HI> Bethlehem&mdash;<HI>art not the lea&s;t among the
princes of</HI> Juda: <HI>for out of thee &s;hall come a</HI> GOVERNOUR
THAT SHALL RULE MY PEOPLE ISRAEL, <HI>Matth.</HI> ii. 4, 5.
So that all the di&s;turbance at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> which St. <HI>Mat|thew</HI>
&s;peaks of, was on account of the birth of a King
of the <HI>Jews.</HI> It is the &s;ame thing in <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> And the
<HI>chief prie&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Scribes</HI> of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> were undoubtedly
of the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> which are the per&s;ons &s;o much &s;poken
of by <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> The <HI>King</HI> in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has a character
of the Chri&s;t or Me&s;&s;ias: <HI>for all things would be in his
power.</HI> Whether the je&s;t upon <HI>Bagoas,</HI> and through
him upon the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> be of <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s own invention;
or whether it was an old piece of wit in u&s;e among pro|fane
people, to banter tho&s;e who expected great things
from the Me&s;&s;ias; or whether it be matter of fact, that
&s;ome of the <HI>Phari&s;es</HI> did at that time give any &s;uch a&s;&s;u|rances
to &s;ome per&s;on of influence in <HI>Judea,</HI> the better to
carry on &s;elfi&s;h de&s;igns, I do not determine. But it is
an evidence, that the King, who was then the &s;ubject of
di&s;cour&s;e, was &s;uppo&s;ed to be an extraordinary per&s;on.</P>
<P>In <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> give out a prediction, that
<HI>God had decreed to put an end to</HI> Herod'<HI>s government,</HI> &amp;c.
This I take to be the &s;ame thing which <HI>the chief prie&s;ts and
&s;cribes</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Unde putas factum, ut eo ip&s;o tempore, proxim&egrave; po&s;t de&s;crip|tionem Judaicam Phari&s;aei vaticinia i&s;ta tractaret, &amp; pro lubitu &s;uo interpretarentur?

That is, what <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> calls a <HI>prediction</HI> or <HI>pro|phecy</HI>
of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> is no more than an interpretation
or application of an ancient prophecy. Thus <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
took upon him&s;elf the aire and character of a prophet,
when he applied the ancient <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> prophecies of the
Me&s;&s;ias to <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian.</HI> He was taken pri&s;oner by <HI>Ve&s;pa|&s;ian,</HI>
then General in <HI>Judea</HI> under <HI>Nero. Jo&s;ephus,</HI> hear|ing
that <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> had a de&s;ign to &s;end him to the Em|peror,
de&s;ired he might &s;peak with the General in pri|vate.
Being brought before <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> and all the com|pany
being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, except <HI>Titus</HI> and two friends, <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
begins: &startq;You think, <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> that you have
in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> a meer pri&s;oner. But I am come to you
as a me&s;&s;enger of great things. Had I not been &s;ent
to you by God, I knew what the law of the <HI>Jews</HI> is,
and how it becomes a General to die. Do you &s;end
me to <HI>Nero?</HI> What! are they who are to &s;ucceed
<HI>Nero</HI> before you to continue? You <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian</HI> will be
<HI>Ce&s;ar:</HI> You, and this your &s;on will be Emperour.

<P>HOWEVER, be&s;ide the an&s;wer given by the <HI>Scribes</HI>
to <HI>Herod</HI>'s enquiry, we are to remember the &s;peech
made by old <HI>Simeon,</HI> an eminent <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> at the pre|&s;entation
of Je&s;us at the temple; and that <HI>Anna</HI> a PRO|PHETESSE
<HI>gave thanks unto the Lord, and &s;pake of him to
all them that looked for redemption in</HI> I&s;rael. And there
might be many other &s;uch like things &s;aid there by
Others; to all which <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> a Prie&s;t, and well inform|ed
of what was &s;aid and done at the temple, may be
ju&s;tly &s;uppo&s;ed to have a reference.</P>
<P><PB N="373" REF="391">
ST. <HI>Matthew</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>when</HI> Herod <HI>&s;aw that he was</HI>
MOCKED <HI>of the wi&s;e men, he was</HI> EXCEEDING WROTH, <HI>and
&s;ent forth, and &s;lew all the children that were in</HI> Bethlehem,
<HI>and in all the coa&s;ts thereof. Jo&s;ephus</HI> has given us the
tokens of an uncommon rage in <HI>Herod.</HI> And though St.
<HI>Matthew</HI> has related, upon this occa&s;ion, no other in|&s;tance
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s cruelty, be&s;ide the orders for de&s;troying
the <HI>children</HI> in and near <HI>Bethlehem;</HI> yet nothing is more
likely, than that <HI>Herod,</HI> the mo&s;t jealous of mortals,
&s;hould, upon the retreat of the wi&s;e men, be filled with
&s;u&s;picions, that the <HI>Scribes</HI> and <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> whom he had
lately con&s;ulted about the birth-place of the King of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> had been acce&s;&s;ory to the di&s;appointment he had
met with from the &s;aid wi&s;e men: and that being heated
by the in&s;inuations of his &s;i&s;ter <HI>Salome</HI> (provided <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>
has not brought her in here for the &s;ake of a je&s;t)
and by the barbarous coun&s;els of his &s;on <HI>Antipater,</HI> now
in <HI>Judea,</HI> and in high favour, he &s;hould then make al&s;o
that cruel ravage in his court and at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> of which
our <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> hi&s;torian has given us a &s;ummary account.</P>
<P>(3.) As I think, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was a very firm <HI>Jew;</HI>
&s;o his indecent way of &s;peaking of this affair is a &s;trong
proof it relates to the tran&s;actions at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> af|ter
the birth of Je&s;us. Is it not &s;trange, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
&s;hould banter the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> for pretending to the gift of
foreknowledge, when he him&s;elf, a <HI>Phari&s;ee,</HI> has been
mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly guilty of it? I intend not only his &s;peech
to <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> ju&s;t now tran&s;cribed. There are other, ra|ther
more flagrant in&s;tances, and that in the hi&s;tory of
the<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Vid. de Bell. lib. iii. cap. 7. &sect;. 3. vid. &amp; quae &s;equuntur Jo&s;ephi ad Ve&s;pa&s;ianum alloquium, ibid. &sect;. 9.</NOTE> <HI>jewi&s;h war,</HI> writ long before his <HI>Antiquities,</HI> in
which is the pa&s;&s;age we are upon. His ridicule of the
<HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> appears to me very un&s;ea&s;onable in an ac|count
of &s;uch a &s;cene of cruelty, and when they were
under very heavy &s;ufferings? And for what? For re|fu&s;ing
the oath of fidelity? No. They had e&s;caped
with a <HI>fine</HI> for <HI>not &s;wearing to</HI> Ce&s;ar, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> if there had
not followed &s;ome offen&s;es more particularly again&s;t
<PB N="374" REF="392">
<HI>Herod,</HI> as is pretended. And what are the&s;e? Why pre|dictions
and expectations, that the kingdome was by the
decree and appointment of God to be transferred to
&s;ome per&s;on not of <HI>Herod</HI>'s race: another in&s;tance of
agreement with the time that &s;ucceeded the birth of
Je&s;us, which, according to the Evangeli&s;ts, was a time
of great expectation of a King predicted and prophe&s;ied
of. But here is not one riotous or &s;editious action men|tioned
or hinted, the utmo&s;t is &s;editious words. And
yet <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> ju&s;tifies, triumphs in the&s;e terrible execu|tions.
In a word, he, who u&s;es to condemn <HI>Herod</HI> as a
man of an inhumane di&s;po&s;ition, here treats the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI>
of this time with <HI>Herodian</HI> cruelty.</P>
<P>ALL this is ab&s;olutely unaccountable to me, but up|on
the &s;uppo&s;ition, that this affair relates to the birth
of Je&s;us. Nor do I think, that I wrong <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> in the
le&s;t. It is to me more than probable, that every <HI>Jew,</HI>
who did not believe Je&s;us to be the Chri&s;t (as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
did not) had a great deal of ill-will again&s;t him and all
his followers. That any <HI>Jew</HI> of tho&s;e times &s;hould have
been long in a &s;tate of indifference upon this point, was
impo&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>IF it be &s;aid, that the predictions mentioned by <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
relate not to Je&s;us, but to <HI>Pheroras's wife, and
her children:</HI> I do not deny, but that &s;he might pay a
regard to what the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> &s;aid at this time, as well as
others did: but that &s;he, or <HI>Pheroras,</HI> or any one i&s;|&s;uing
from them was the per&s;on then di&s;cour&s;ed of, and
the chief &s;ubject of the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> predictions, I do not
believe, becau&s;e it is incon&s;i&s;tent with the re&s;t of <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>'s
&s;tory. If <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife had been the per&s;on
chiefly concerned in this affair, as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> pretends here;
would &s;he have e&s;caped with her life in &s;o wide a &s;cene of
cruelty, in which even the former favourites of <HI>Herod</HI>
were involved? If the di&s;po&s;itions of people ran now all
toward <HI>Pheroras</HI> and his wife, would <HI>Antipater</HI> have been
&s;till great with them? Would <HI>Antipater,</HI> &s;o de&s;irous of
the crown, have gone away to <HI>Rome,</HI> as he did &s;oon af|ter
this execution, and leave-things in this po&s;ture?
<PB N="375" REF="393">
Would he, when he went away, leave &s;ecurely in the
hands of <HI>Pheroras</HI> and his wife the work of poy&s;oning his
father, and &s;ecuring the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for him&s;elf? Would
not <HI>Antipater,</HI> who had lately with exqui&s;ite artifice and
cruelty accompli&s;hed the death of his two brothers, &s;ons
of <HI>Herod</HI> by <HI>Mariamne,</HI> have been able to effect the
raine of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife?</P>
<P>IT is true, after this execution was over, &s;he was cal|led
to account by <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>THAT it may not be in&s;inuated, that I conceal any
difficulty, I will here give the reader <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s words
which follow next after the long pa&s;&s;age we are concern|ed
with. &startq;<HI>Herod</HI> having puni&s;hed the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> who
had been convicted of concerning them&s;elves in this
affair, calls a council of his friends, and there accu&s;es
<HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife: a&s;cribing to her the affront that had
been offered to the virgins<NOTE N="B" PLACE="foot"><HI>The Virgins</HI>] The meaning is: <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife had been his &s;ervant. <HI>Herod</HI> had offered <HI>Pheroras</HI> one of his daughters, and after that, another. But <HI>Pheroras</HI> refu&s;ed them both out of his affection for this woman.</NOTE>, and therein to him:
adding, that &s;he did all &s;he could to create a difference
between him and his brother; that the fine impo&s;ed
upon the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> had been evaded by her means,
and that in the pre&s;ent affair nothing had been done
without her:&mdash;and that if <HI>Pheroras</HI> had any regard
for him, he would of his own accord put away his
wife. You will then, &s;ays he to <HI>Pheroras,</HI> be my bro|ther
indeed, and we &s;hall live<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 17. c. 3. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> together in friendship.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="394">
IF the meaning of the la&s;t words of the <HI>charge</HI> again&s;t
this woman be not, that in the <HI>pre&s;ent affair nothing had
been done without her,</HI> as I have rendered them, but that
<HI>Now a days nothing was done without her,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Hud&s;on</HI>
tran&s;lates them<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Sui&s;que impendiis evitata e&s;&s;et &s;olutio mulctae ab ip&s;o impo&s;itae, nihilque jam fine illa ageretur.</NOTE>; then her conduct in the late affair
is not &s;o much as made any particular crime, but is on|ly
comprehended in a general charge of an over bu&s;y
intriguing temper.</P>
<P>BUT let it be granted that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, her conduct
in this affair was an expre&s;s charge in <HI>Herod</HI>'s accu&s;ation;
yet the puni&s;hment propo&s;ed confutes the &s;uppo&s;ition,
that &s;he was the main agent in this concern. <HI>Herod</HI> a&s;|&s;ures
<HI>Pheroras,</HI> they two &s;hould be very good friends, if
this woman were but <HI>put away.</HI> Would this di&s;grace
have &s;atisfied <HI>Herod,</HI> if, be&s;ide many other provocations,
&s;he had now been the Principal in a crime, for which
many acce&s;&s;ories, and tho&s;e in all other re&s;pects very
acceptable per&s;ons, had been puni&s;hed with death? I
hope we may be allowed not to credit <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> in a cir|cum&s;tance
&s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with the re&s;t of his account.
And I think, it is not hard to gue&s;&s;e, why <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
gave &s;ome fal&s;e turns in this &s;tory.</P>
<P>I HAVE one thing more to de&s;ire of the reader, that is,
that he will be plea&s;ed to con&s;ider, whether <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> does
not contradict him&s;elf in the main pa&s;&s;age, in which he is
&s;o merry. He tells us at fir&s;t, that the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> in re|quital
for the kindne&s;&s;e &s;hewed to them, foretold, that
God had decreed to transfer the kingdome to <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s
<HI>wife, and</HI> Pheroras, <HI>and their children:</HI> But at the end,
it is <HI>the King, who was to be appointed according to their
prediction.</HI> How comes <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s <HI>wife, and</HI> Pheroras,
<HI>and their children</HI> to be all a <HI>King?</HI> Or how came the
<HI>King</HI> to be all them? If the reader can reconcile the&s;e
things together, it will be very well. But if he cannot,
perhaps he will allow, that here are &s;ome things &s;aid of
<HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife and the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> without foundation. I
ever take it, that incon&s;i&s;tences are a certain &s;ign, that
<PB N="377" REF="395">
an hi&s;torian has not confined him&s;elf barely to matter of
fact, but has indulged his fan&s;y, or his pa&s;&s;ions, and
gon into fiction.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons then I think, that the <HI>Oath</HI> in <HI>Jo|&s;ephus,</HI>
taken by all the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation, is the &s;ame thing
with the taxing or enrolment mention'd by St. <HI>Luke.</HI> And
I think, that this oath refers to a cen&s;us made in <HI>Judea,</HI>
for the following rea&s;ons. In a cen&s;us the people gave
in an account of them&s;elves and their e&s;tates upon <HI>oath.</HI>
It &s;eems to me very probable that a cen&s;us was made,
or at le&s;t ordered by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> during the time that
<HI>Herod</HI> lay under his di&s;plea&s;ure. Under the former par|ticular
I &s;hewed, that <HI>Herod</HI> had been, before this, a
tributary prince. His great &s;ubjection appears likewi&s;e
in the difference between him and <HI>Obodas.</HI> He was o|bliged
to refer the matter in di&s;pute to the Emperour's
officers in <HI>Syria.</HI> After <HI>Obodas</HI> had broke the &s;tipula|tions,
<HI>Herod</HI> did not dare to move his forces without the
con&s;ent of the before-mentioned officers. And <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI>
&s;uppo&s;ing that he had done &s;o, was very angry, and
threatens, that whereas he had <HI>hitherto u&s;ed him as a
friend, he &s;hould for the future treat him as a &s;ubject.</HI> The&s;e
words are undoubtedly proper and expre&s;&s;ive words. If
<HI>Herod,</HI> when a <HI>friend</HI> of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> was in &s;uch &s;ubjection;
what can the treating as a <HI>&s;ubject</HI> mean, but the reducing
him to the lowe&s;t &s;tate of dependent princes? which
&s;eems to be that of obliging them to &s;ubmit to a cen&s;us,
and then rai&s;ing tribute in their dominions according
to it.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> &s;ays, that after the receit of this letter
from <HI>Augu&s;tus, Herod</HI> &s;ent in vain two amba&s;&s;ies to
<HI>Rome,</HI> that the &s;tate of <HI>Judea</HI> grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e, that
<HI>Herod</HI> was obliged to &s;ubmit to many di&s;graces. The
Emperour's di&s;plea&s;ure again&s;t <HI>Herod</HI> was manife&s;t there|fore,
not at <HI>Rome</HI> only, but in all the countries about
<HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>(1.) BUT it may be objected, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has no
where &s;aid, that there was any enrolment of the <HI>Jews,</HI>
much le&s;s that there was a proper cen&s;us made in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="378" REF="396">
TO this I an&s;wer, that it is apparent, there was an
enrolment and numbring of the people. How el&s;e
&s;hould all the people have taken an oath, except <HI>&s;ix thou|&s;and
Phari&s;ees?</HI> Did they not enter the people that took
the oath? If they did not, how &s;hould it have been
known who &s;wore and who did not?</P>
<P>NOR can it be inferred there was no enrolment or cen|&s;us,
becau&s;e <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has not expre&s;sly &s;aid there was. <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>'s
account of this matter is very &s;light and defective.
If it had not been for &s;ome things which followed after
the oath, and had &s;ome connexion with it, it &s;eems that
he would have taken no notice of it at all. An oath had
been taken by all the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Herod,</HI>
and great exactne&s;&s;e had been ob&s;erved in relation to it.
The numbers and characters of tho&s;e which had refu&s;ed
were known. This was an affair of importance, and
de&s;erved a much more particular account than he has
given us. And we are allowed to &s;uppo&s;e &s;ome things,
not expre&s;&s;ed, which mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have been conco|mitants
of it.</P>
<P>I DO not pretend to a&s;&s;ign po&s;itively the rea&s;ons of
his &s;light mention of this affair. But I apprehend, I
can give &s;ome probable account of it. <HI>Herod</HI>'s &s;ubjects
were all enrolled in a cen&s;us, but there was no tribute
demanded upon it. <HI>Herod</HI> had great dexterity, or very
good fortune in &s;urmounting the difficulties he met with
in the &s;everal parts of his life. He was him&s;elf a man of
a great genius, and &s;ome of his &s;ervants were men of
great abilities. <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> in particular was
eminent for learning and addre&s;&s;e. And <HI>Herod</HI> knew
very well how to be&s;tow a pre&s;ent or a bribe.</P>
<P>I AM moreover the rather inclined to think, that
no tax was rai&s;ed upon this cen&s;us; becau&s;e it appears
that after the&s;e troubles, of which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has given
us an account, <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was in a great mea&s;ure recon|ciled
to <HI>Herod.</HI> Perceiving that his re&s;entment again&s;t
<HI>Herod</HI> had been very much founded upon a&s;per&s;ions, he
might be di&s;po&s;ed to forbear exacting the tribute upon
the cen&s;us, and to let things go on in the old way. Then
<PB N="379" REF="397">
<HI>Herod</HI> had taken care, that the decree had been obeyed
and executed in his dominions without di&s;turbance: all
had &s;worn or enrolled them&s;elves, except <HI>&s;ix thou&s;and
Phari&s;ees,</HI> and they were fined.</P>
<P>MOREOVER, <HI>Herod</HI> was now an old man, and had
many &s;ons. It was therefore very likely, there would
be &s;ome partition made of his dominions at his death.
And <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> might be very willing there &s;hould be &s;o.
Three or four little princes are better governed than
one that is powerful. Tribute could not be paid ac|cording
to this cen&s;us any longer than the &s;everal parts
of the kingdome continued united in one per&s;on. When
it came to be divided or parcelled out, a new cen&s;us
would be nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IF then no tribute was paid upon this cen&s;us, an hi|&s;torian
could the more ea&s;ily pa&s;s it by without a parti|cular
de&s;cription, e&s;pecially &s;ince it had been fini&s;hed
without any popular tumults.</P>
<P>IT may be inferred from the manner in which St. <HI>Luke</HI>
mentions this &s;urvey, that it was not very much taken
notice of. If it had been univer&s;ally known, there
had been hardly any occa&s;ion, upon the mention of a
decree of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> in the reign of <HI>Herod</HI> to enroll all the
land, to &s;ubjoin a parenthe&s;is, the chief intent of which
&s;eems to be to di&s;tingui&s;h this from another that hap|pened
not till after the removal of <HI>Herod</HI>'s &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>IF this cen&s;us was not univer&s;ally known when <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>
wrote, he might be well plea&s;ed to touch upon it
&s;lightly. The <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> writers were very forward to enu|merate
the honours done to their people by the Roman
Senate, or the chief men of the Commonwealth, or the
Emperours afterwards; the better to gain &s;ome regard
among other nations, by whom they were generally
de&s;pi&s;ed and hated. But as for any di&s;graces they re|ceived
from the <HI>Romans,</HI> the ca&s;e was very different.</P>
<P>THUS <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has mentioned many favours confer|red
on the <HI>Jews</HI> by <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar, Augu&s;tus, Livia, Mar|cus
Agrippa, Claudius,</HI> and other <HI>Romans:</HI> but yet he

<HI>Suetonius</HI> only, an author very little concerned in <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>

&s;acrifice at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> nor made any pre&s;ent to the tem|ple,
which was deemed a piece of contempt &s;hewn to
their religion.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> found but a &s;lender account of
this tran&s;action in the Hi&s;tory of <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI>
from which he took his materials for this reign. Tho'
<HI>Nicolas</HI> was no <HI>Jew,</HI> yet he was a great friend and flatter|er
of <HI>Herod:</HI> and it could not but be an ungrateful task
to him, after that he had in the former part of his work
drawn his ma&s;ter as a great genius, a founder of cities,
and friend of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> to de&s;cribe at la&s;t &s;o di&s;agreeable
a &s;cene as that of one of the Emperour's officers enrol|ling

<P><HI>NICOLAS</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 17. c. 5. &sect;. 3.</NOTE> had great intimacies with <HI>Herod.
Jo&s;ephus</HI> has affirmed more than once, that he was a
great flatterer<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Ibid. l. xiv. c. 1. &sect;. 3.</NOTE> of him. And in one place &s;ays
particularly, &startq;that living in his kingdome and to|gether

This enrolment, even though it was not a pro|per
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement, but only an entry of the names of all
the people, their age and condition, accompanied with
an oath of &s;trict fidelity to the Emperour, mu&s;t have
been the greate&s;t mortification of <HI>Herod</HI>'s whole life:
and from the character of <HI>Nicolas,</HI> ju&s;t &s;et down, it may
be concluded almo&s;t with certainty, that he did not give
a particular account of this affair. Nor had <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
any inducements to &s;upply his defects in this place.</P>
<P><PB N="381" REF="399">
(2.) BUT it will be &s;aid, that the &s;ilence of <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
is not the only difficulty: there is in him well nigh po|&s;itive
proof, that there had been no cen&s;us or enrolment
made in <HI>Judea</HI> before the removal of <HI>Archelaus.</HI> For
upon the occa&s;ion of this, he &s;ays: &startq;Moreover <HI>Cyreni|us</HI>
came into <HI>Judea,</HI> it being annexed to the province
of <HI>Syria,</HI> to make an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement of their goods, and
&s;ei&s;e <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s e&s;tate. The <HI>Jews</HI> were at fir&s;t very
much moved at the<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 18. c. 1. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> mention of the enrolments,
but by degrees they were brought to acquie&s;ce at the
per&s;wa&s;ion of <HI>Joazar</HI> the High Prie&s;t.&endq; He ob&s;erves
al&s;o, &startq;that at this time <HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Gaulanite</HI> excited them

downright<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> &s;lavery.&endq; It will be &s;aid: It may
be hence inferred, that there had been no enrolments
made before: if there had, they could not have been &s;o
frightful now.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that there mu&s;t have been an enrolment
made, when the oath mentioned by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was taken:
And that oath was likewi&s;e an expre&s;s and &s;olemn ac|knowledgement
of &s;ubjection to the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>BESIDES, though this <HI>oath</HI> had been quite omitted
by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> it would not have followed, that there had
been no enrolment made before this time in <HI>Judea.</HI> Peo|ple
are not always of the &s;ame temper. <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI>
now broached or revived the principle, that they ought
to obey none but God: and for &s;ome rea&s;ons it was re|ceived
with great applau&s;e, &s;pread and gained ground.
But the <HI>Jews</HI> mu&s;t have been more &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, when
they all took the oath to <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> except &s;ix thou&s;and.
And after <HI>Herod</HI> was dead, there was a very numerous
amba&s;&s;y &s;ent to <HI>Rome</HI> in the name of the whole <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
nation, entreating, that in&s;tead of being governed by
any of <HI>Herod</HI>'s de&s;cendents, &startq;they<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Jo&s;. Ant. 17. p. 784. v. 35.</NOTE> might be annexed

to the Province of <HI>Syria,</HI> and be &s;ubject to Praetors
&s;ent from thence, promi&s;ing likewi&s;e a mo&s;t quiet and
peaceable behaviour under &s;uch a government.&endq;</P>
<P>IN another place <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> repre&s;ents <HI>Judas</HI>'s argu|ments
in the&s;e terms: &startq;And at this time a certain man,
called <HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Galilean,</HI> excited the people to re|bellion,
telling them, they had a mean &s;pirit if they
could endure to pay tribute to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and ack|nowledge
mortal men for their Lords;&mdash;after God
had been their King<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. De Bell. lib. ii. cap. 8. &sect;. 1.</NOTE>.&endq; It might be as well infer|red
from what <HI>Judas</HI> &s;ays here, that the <HI>Jews</HI> had never
before paid tribute to the <HI>Romans,</HI> or been &s;ubject to
mortal Lords, as from what he &s;ays in the other place,
that they had never before been enrolled. I pre&s;ume it
need not be proved, that they had been &s;ubject, before
this, to <HI>mortal Lords.</HI> I think too, that I have &s;hewn,
they had been tributary to the <HI>Romans</HI> in the reign of
<HI>Herod.</HI> They had likewi&s;e paid tribute to the <HI>Romans</HI>
before <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign: For <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius</HI>
&startq;impo&s;ed a heavy tribute upon the people <HI>[in Syria</HI>].
And in particular bore very hard upon <HI>Judea,</HI> exact|ing
of them &s;even hundred talents of &s;ilver<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Ant. lib. 14. cap. xi. &sect;. 2.</NOTE>.&endq;
This &s;um was laid in &s;everal portions upon the &s;everal
parts of <HI>Judea;</HI> and <HI>Herod,</HI> then Governour of <HI>Galilee</HI>
under <HI>Hyrcanus,</HI> brought in his quota the fir&s;t, and
thereby very much obliged <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius. Judas</HI>'s &s;peech
therefore is no proof, that there had been no enrolment
or cen&s;us made in <HI>Judea</HI> before the removal of <HI>Ar|chellaus.</HI></P>
<P>(3.) I CAN think of but one difficulty more. Per|haps
&s;ome will &s;ay, my argument is defective, and that
in order to make it out, that this <HI>oath,</HI> taken by the
<HI>Jews,</HI> in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> was a cen&s;us, I ought to produce
&s;ome pa&s;&s;ages of an ancient writer, in which a cen&s;us is
<PB N="383" REF="401">
called an <HI>Oath,</HI> or the act or the people enrolling them|&s;elves
in a cen&s;us is expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>taking an oath.</HI> I own
then, that I have not any &s;uch example by me. How|ever,
I would offer here two or three con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>[1.] IN a Roman cen&s;us the people gave in their ac|count
of them&s;elves and their e&s;tates upon oath. And that
oath, as repre&s;ented by <HI>Diony&s;ius,</HI> has a very near re|&s;emblance
with the words of <HI>Jo&s;ephus. Diony&s;ius</HI> &s;ays,
the people were commanded to <HI>take an oath to give in a
true account, according to the be&s;t of their knowledge:</HI> and
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that the whole <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation engaged by an
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">THERE is another thing which may de&s;erve notice. <HI>Diony|&s;ius</HI> &s;ays, That the penalty at <HI>Rome</HI> for not enrolling in a cen&s;us was lo&s;s of e&s;tate and citizen&s;hip. Perhaps the <HI>fine</HI> impo&s;ed on the <HI>Phari|&s;ees,</HI> who refu&s;ed to &s;wear, was now ordered in conformity to the Roman Cu&s;toms upon like occa&s;ions. For <HI>Herod</HI> had been wont be|fore to inflict puni&s;hments of another kind for refu&s;ing to &s;wear fidelity to him. Antiq. 15. c. 10. &sect;. 4.</NOTE> oath to <HI>be faithful</HI> Ce&s;ar <HI>and the intere&s;ts of the King.</HI></P>
<P>[2.] WE have in the ancient writers very few accounts
of a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ements made in provinces. The Roman hi&s;to|rians
&s;carce ever take any notice of them, but when
they were attended with &s;ome di&s;turbances which made
them remarkable. As we have but very few writers of
tho&s;e times, e&s;pecially &s;uch as lived in the provinces, it
is not to be wondered that we meet with &s;ome &s;ingular
phra&s;es in tho&s;e we have, and which we cannot paral|lel
in any other authors now in our hands. If we had
before us the works of a good number of provincial
writers, it is not unlikely, but we might &s;ee &s;ome of
them repre&s;ent their nation enrolling them&s;elves in a
cen&s;us, e&s;pecially in the fir&s;t cen&s;us made in their coun|try,
by the taking an <HI>oath</HI> of allegiance and fidelity to
the Emperour. I &s;hall give an in&s;tance from <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI>
which has likewi&s;e &s;ome affinity with our &s;ubject. In
the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> war he calls <HI>Fabatus Ce&s;ar</HI>'s Procurator<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> De Bell. l. I. cap. 29. p. 1030. v. 22. vid. &amp; v. 29.</NOTE>:
In his <HI>Antiquities</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">&mdash;<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. 17. cap. 3. p. 755. v. 6.</NOTE> he calls him <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI>'s Servant. He
<PB N="384" REF="402">
al&s;o calls one <HI>Stephen,</HI> who was in <HI>Judea</HI> in the time of
<HI>Cumanus, Ce&s;ar</HI>'s &s;ervant. &startq;And<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Antiq. 20. cap. 4. &sect;. 4. vid. &amp; de Bell. p. 1072. v. 32.</NOTE> at this time, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI> &s;ome who aimed at innovations &s;et upon <HI>Stephen</HI> a
&s;ervant of <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> in the High-way about a hundred
&s;tadia from the city, and robbed him of all he had.&endq;
I have &s;hewn above, that <HI>Fabatus</HI> was <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s Procu|rator
in the Kingdom of <HI>Arabia,</HI> if not al&s;o in <HI>Judea,</HI>
And that <HI>Stephen</HI> al&s;o was Procurator in <HI>Judea,</HI> may
be concluded from the trea&s;ure he had with him, and
from his being particularly the object of the &s;pite of the
&s;editious <HI>Jews,</HI> who were unea&s;y under the Roman go|vernment.
So that, with <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> the <HI>Emperour's &s;er|vant</HI>
and the <HI>procurator of the Emperour's revenue</HI> were
&s;ynonymous terms. If <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> appears at pre&s;ent &s;in|gular
in this &s;tile, yet I doubt not, but it was at that
time very common.</P>
<P>[3.] I APPREHEND, that though the <HI>Jews</HI> entered
them&s;elves and their e&s;tates in the way of a Roman cen|&s;us,
yet there was no tribute rai&s;ed upon it: Which
might be the rea&s;on <HI>of Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s repre&s;enting this affair
&s;imply by taking an oath, rather than by the name of
a cen&s;us.</P>
<P>I HAVE now laid before the reader the evidence I
have for this &s;uppo&s;ition, that there was a cen&s;us made
in <HI>Judea</HI> a little before the death of <HI>Herod.</HI> The par|ticulars
mentioned by St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and the expre&s;&s;ions he
u&s;es, are very &s;uitable to a cen&s;us. And the po&s;ture of
<HI>Herod</HI>'s affairs about this time incline me to think there
was an enrolment, after the manner of a Roman cen|&s;us,
made in his dominions by order of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>BUT whether I am in the right or not, St. <HI>Luke</HI> cer|tainly
&s;ays, that there was an enrolment: And <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
&s;ays, that the whole <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation had taken an oath to
be faithful to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Herod.</HI> Some entry therefore
mu&s;t have been made. And if St. <HI>Luke</HI> be under&s;tood
<PB N="385" REF="403">
to &s;peak only of an enrolment of names and per&s;ons,
his account is confirmed by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> as fully as one
could wi&s;h.</P>
<P>AND though it &s;hould be thought, that I have not
fully proved, that there was at this time a proper a&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ement
made in <HI>Judea;</HI> yet I have, I think, &s;hewn
undeniably, that about this time that country was
brought into a very &s;trict &s;ubjection to <HI>Augu&s;tus:</HI> And
herein al&s;o St. <HI>Luke</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> agree entirely.</P>
<P>I AM &s;en&s;ible that they, who have hitherto &s;uppo&s;ed,
that Je&s;us was not born till a few weeks before the death
of <HI>Herod,</HI> will very unwillingly allow, that the oath in
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has any relation to St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s enrolment. But
then, be&s;ide the task of evading all the many concur|ring
circum&s;tances in St. <HI>Luke</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> they will
labour under one very great difficulty. For this oath
appears to have been taken by the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;o very near
the end of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, that it will be utterly incon|ceiveable,
that the <HI>Romans</HI> &s;hould have ordered another
general enrolment, and hara&s;&s;e the people again before
<HI>Herod</HI>'s death. Nor will they be able to remove this
difficulty by &s;aying, that the <HI>&s;wearing began</HI> about the
time it is placed in by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> but was not fini&s;h'd till a
few weeks before <HI>Herod</HI> died: For it was all over at the
time <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;peaks of it. All had taken the oath, but
&s;ix thou&s;and <HI>Phari&s;ees;</HI> they had refu&s;ed, and were fined.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. THE third objection is this: <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was not
Governour of <HI>Syria</HI> till nine or ten, perhaps twelve
years after our Saviour was born: therefore St. <HI>Luke</HI>
has made a mi&s;take in &s;aying, that this taxing happen|ed
in the time of <HI>Cyrenius.</HI></P>
<P>THIS objection mu&s;t now be &s;tated more at length.
In our tran&s;lation the words are: <HI>And this taxing was
fir&s;t made when</HI> Cyrenius <HI>was governour of</HI> Syria. What
is the &s;en&s;e of our tran&s;lation, I do not know: and it
mu&s;t be owned likewi&s;e, that the words of the Origi|nal
<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> &s;eem to have in them an uncommon ambiguity.
<PB N="386" REF="404">
Many think, the mo&s;t genuine natural &s;en&s;e of the origi|nal
words is: <HI>This fir&s;t taxing</HI> [or enrolment] <HI>was made,
when</HI> Cyrenius <HI>was governour of</HI> Syria. Upon this &s;en&s;e
of them the objection is founded. And it is urged, this
cannot be agreeable to the truth. For the Evangeli&s;ts
have a&s;&s;ured us, that Je&s;us was born in the latter end of
<HI>Herod</HI>'s, reign. But <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Ant. L. 17. cap. v &sect;. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Quintilius
Varus</HI> was then pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria,</HI> and he mu&s;t have
been &s;o at le&s;t a year before <HI>Herod</HI> died. And <HI>Saturninus</HI>
was his predece&s;&s;or. Moreover <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Cy|renius</HI>
was &s;ent Governour into <HI>Syria,</HI> when <HI>Archelaus</HI>
was removed from his government of <HI>Judea,</HI> who yet
reigned there between nine and ten years after <HI>Herod.
Jo&s;ephus</HI> relates this matter, in his <HI>Antiquities,</HI> thus:</P>
<P>&startq;BUT in the tenth year<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s govern|ment,

to <HI>Rome.</HI> When he came thither, <HI>Ce&s;ar,</HI> having heard

him, appointing <HI>Vienna</HI> a city in <HI>Gaul</HI> for the place of
his abode<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Ant. L. 17. c. 15. &sect;. 2.</NOTE>. And the country of <HI>Archelaus</HI> being

<P>IT is objected therefore, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has commit|ted
a very gro&s;&s;e mi&s;take, in &s;aying, that <HI>this taxing
was made when</HI> Cyrenius <HI>was governour of</HI> Syria: &s;ince
it appears from <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was not pre&s;ident
of that province till after the bani&s;hment of <HI>Archelaus,
Herod</HI>'s &s;on and &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer, that though the &s;en&s;e of the words,
as they now &s;tand in St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s Go&s;pel, &s;hould be &s;up|po&s;ed
incon&s;i&s;tent with this account taken from <HI>Jo&s;ephus;</HI>
yet it would be unrea&s;onable to conclude, that St. <HI>Luke</HI>
had really made any mi&s;take. St. <HI>Luke</HI> appears in the
re&s;t of his hi&s;tory, and from many particulars of this ac|count
before us, to be &s;o fully ma&s;ter of the &s;tate of <HI>Ju|dea,</HI>
and of the nature of this affair he is here &s;peaking
of, that it is impo&s;&s;ible he &s;hould commit any &s;uch
mi&s;take.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of his third chapter He has mo&s;t
exactly &s;pecified the &s;tate of all <HI>Judea,</HI> or the land of
<HI>I&s;rael,</HI> as it was in the fifteenth year of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> by &s;et|ting
down the &s;everal Tetrarchs and Governours of it,
and the true extent of their territories.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> under&s;tood the nature of enrolments, as
made by the <HI>Romans.</HI> The enrolment now made, was by
virtue of a Decree of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> And he &s;ays that <HI>Jo&s;eph
went to be taxed with</HI> Mary <HI>his e&s;pou&s;ed wife.</HI> This was
the cu&s;tom of the <HI>Romans,</HI> as has been &s;hewed from un|doubted
te&s;timonies, to enrole <HI>women</HI> as well as men;
whereas the <HI>Jews</HI> u&s;ed to number or enrole <HI>Males</HI> only.</P>
<P><PB N="388" REF="406">
MOREOVER, St. <HI>Luke</HI> appears to be well acquaint|ed
with the cen&s;us which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> gives us an account of.
<HI>Gamaliel</HI> &s;ays: <HI>After this man ro&s;e up</HI> Judas <HI>of</HI> Galilee,
<HI>in the days of the taxing, and drew away much people
after him: he al&s;o peri&s;hed, and as many as obeyed him,
were di&s;per&s;ed,</HI> Acts v. 37. I think it may be fairly &s;up|po&s;ed,
that St. <HI>Luke</HI> under&s;tood what he has related
from <HI>Gamaliel.</HI> And then, here are particulars enough
to &s;atisfie us, he wanted no information concerning the
cen&s;us which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;peaks of.</P>
<P>THAT <HI>Gamaliel</HI> here &s;peaks of the cen&s;us made in
<HI>Judea</HI> after the bani&s;hment of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> is evident, be|cau&s;e
it was at that time, that <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee</HI> rai&s;ed a
di&s;turbance. <HI>Gamaliel</HI> calls them <HI>the days of the taxing,</HI>
which implies, that this was a very noted and remarka|ble
period: as it is certain, it was.</P>
<P><HI>GAMALIEL</HI> here calls this <HI>Judas</HI> by his proper
name. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> does in one place call him <HI>Judas Gaula|nites</HI>
<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ant. l. 18. c. I. p. 792. v. 3.</NOTE>, but he often &s;tiles him <HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Galilean,</HI> or
of <HI>Galilee</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> p. 1060. 8</NOTE>. <HI>Gamaliel</HI> &s;ays, that he <HI>drew away much

almo&s;t the &s;ame words<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> de B. J. l. vii. p. 1313. v. 41.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><HI>GAMALIEL</HI> does exactly &s;pecifie the time in which
this man <HI>ro&s;e up,</HI> namely in <HI>the time of the taxing,</HI> or of
the enrolment: for <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, &startq; he per&s;waded not
a few not to enrole them&s;elves, when <HI>Cyrenius</HI> the Cen|&s;or
was &s;ent into <HI>Judea</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Ibid. &amp; p. 792. init.</NOTE></P>
<P><HI>GAMALIEL</HI> &s;ays, <HI>he al&s;o peri&s;hed, and all, even
as many as obeyed him, were &s;cattered. Jo&s;ephus</HI> has no
where related particularly the end of this <HI>Judas.</HI> But
that his enterprize was defeated at that time, we may
be certain. otherwi&s;e the Roman Government could
not have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted in that country with any quiet, which
yet it did for near &s;ixty years after the bani&s;hment of
<PB N="389" REF="407">
<HI>Archelaus.</HI> Nor is there after this any mention made,
in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s hi&s;tory, of any action or attempt of <HI>Judas.</HI></P>
<P>PERHAPS it will be here objected, that <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s
words imply, that this de&s;ign of <HI>Judas</HI> was quite con|founded,
and his principles &s;unk at once: And yet it
&s;eems likely from the unea&s;ine&s;&s;e which the <HI>Jews</HI> expre&s;s
under the Roman tribute in &s;ome places of the Evange|li&s;ts,
that his principles were in being long afterwards:
And from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> it appears, that his notions were ve|ry
prevalent, and were one cau&s;e of their war at la&s;t
with the <HI>Romans.</HI></P>
<P>BUT if any &s;o under&s;tand <HI>Gamaliel,</HI> they appear to
me very much to mi&s;take the de&s;ign of his Argument.
Doubtle&s;s it was not without &s;pecial rea&s;on that <HI>Gama|liel</HI>
alleged the&s;e two in&s;tances. And he &s;peaks of each
in a very different manner. Of <HI>Theudas</HI> he &s;ays: <HI>He
was &s;lain, and all, as many as obeyed him, were &s;cattered
and brought to nought</HI> [<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">] They
were ruined and came to nothing. Of <HI>Judas</HI> he &s;ays:
<HI>He al&s;o peri&s;hed, and all, as many obeyed him, were di&s;|per&s;ed</HI>
[<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">]. Having mentioned the&s;e two
in&s;tances, which the council were well acquainted with,
and hereby laid a foundation for the advice he propo&s;ed
to give, he goes on: <HI>And now I &s;ay unto you, refrain
from the&s;e men, and let them alone: for if this coun&s;el or
this work be of men,</HI> [as <HI>Theudas</HI>'s was] <HI>it will come to</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE>
<HI>$rought</HI> [as his did]. <HI>But if it be of God, ye cannot over|throw
it, le&s;t haply ye be found even to fight again&s;t God.</HI></P>
<P>IT is not to be &s;uppo&s;ed, that <HI>Gamaliel</HI> &s;hould ex|pre&s;ily
&s;ay: <HI>Judas</HI>'s de&s;ign was <HI>of God.</HI> However the
chief men of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation might approve his princi|ples,
they were wi&s;er than openly to e&s;pou&s;e them: they
le&s;t that to the common people.</P>
<P>THE force of <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s argument is this: <HI>Theudas</HI>
and his mea&s;ures came to nothing. After him <HI>Judas</HI> ro&s;e
up: He him&s;elf peri&s;hed, and his people were di&s;per&s;ed;
but yet his principles prevail. You likewi&s;e may now
puni&s;h the&s;e men, and put an end to their lives; but if
<PB N="390" REF="408">
their principles be of God, they will prevail notwith|&s;tanding;
and all the i&s;&s;ue will be, that you will con|tract
guilt, fight again&s;t God, but in vain.</P>
<P>AND to this &s;eems to be owing the great &s;ucce&s;&s;e of
<HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s rea&s;oning, and the &s;ervice he did the Apo&s;tles
at this time. He in&s;inuates &s;ome hopes, that their de|&s;ign
might be of the &s;ame nature with <HI>Judas</HI>'s. This
maybe inferred from his way of expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf: <HI>le&s;t
haply ye be found to fight again&s;t God.</HI> This was <HI>Judas</HI>'s
peculiar principle, that they were to own no mortal
Lords, but God only<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;. p. 1060. v. 10.</NOTE> And it is not unlikely, that
<HI>Gamaliel</HI> intended hereby to in&s;inuate, not only that
there was danger of their oppo&s;ing a de&s;ign which came
from God, and of oppo&s;ing it with no other effect, but
that of contracting guilt to them&s;elves, but al&s;o of op|po&s;ing
the very kingdom and government of God,
which they wi&s;hed to be under.</P>
<P>IT de&s;erves likewi&s;e to be ob&s;erved, that <HI>Gamaliel</HI>
mentions <HI>Theudas</HI> with contempt and indignation. <HI>Be|fore
the&s;e days ro&s;e up</HI> Theudas, <HI>boa&s;ting him&s;elf to be &s;ome|body:</HI>
but nothing like this follows the mention of <HI>Judas.</HI></P>
<P><HI>GAMALIEL</HI> concludes upon the whole, that they
&s;hould <HI>let the&s;e men alone.</HI> We have no occa&s;ion to med|dle
in this matter. It is not unlikely but the <HI>Romans,</HI>
our pre&s;ent Governours, will be jealous of the&s;e men.
But it &s;eems to me an affair we have no rea&s;on to con|cern
our &s;elves in.</P>
<P>ST. <HI>Luke</HI> therefore mu&s;t be &s;uppo&s;ed to be well ac|quainted
with the cen&s;us made after the bani&s;hment of
<HI>Archelaus.</HI></P>
<P>I MUST be permitted to ob&s;erve farther, that St. <HI>Luke</HI>
does here call <HI>Cyrenius</HI> by his true name. It has indeed
been a di&s;pute among learned men, whether his Roman
name was <HI>Quirinus</HI> or <HI>Quirinius. Onuphrius</HI> in his <HI>Fa&s;ti</HI>
printed it <HI>Quirinus: Grotius</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">In Luc. ii. 2.</NOTE> and <HI>Lip&s;ius</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">In not. ad Tacit. ann. l. iii. c. 48.</NOTE> thought
<HI>Onuphrius</HI> was mi&s;taken, and that it ought to be correc|ted
<HI>Quirinius.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ert. de Aug. orb Teir. De&s;er. &sect;. 30.</NOTE> <HI>Perizonius</HI> &s;eems to have proved, that
<PB N="391" REF="409">
<HI>Quirinus</HI> is the true way of writing it in <HI>Latin:</HI> &s;ince it
was not the family name, or the <HI>nomen,</HI> but <HI>cognomen,</HI>
the third name of this Gentleman. For his name was
<HI>Caius Sulpicius Quirinus;</HI> and in the <HI>Syriac</HI> ver&s;ion of
St. <HI>Luke</HI> he is written <HI>Curinus,</HI> and in the <HI>Latin</HI> vulgate
<HI>Cyrinus.</HI> But however that be, he allows it to be com|mon
for the <HI>Greeks</HI> to make &s;ome alteration in the ter|mination
of Roman names, when they turn them into
their own language. It is certain his name in all the <HI>Greek</HI>
authors has the termination of <HI>$$orius. Strabo</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Lib. xii. p. 854.</NOTE> and <HI>Dio</HI>
<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Vid. Dio. lib. liv. ad A. U. 742.</NOTE> call him <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> [<HI>Cyrinius</HI>]. But in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI><NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">P. 791. v. 5. 12. p. 794. v. 21, 37. &amp; alibi.</NOTE>
his name is always written, as in St. <HI>Luke, Cyrenius.</HI></P>
<P>MOREOVER, it is certain, <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Governour
of <HI>Syria;</HI> and he has here a very proper title, by which
he mu&s;t have been well known in <HI>Judea,</HI> and in all that
part of the world.</P>
<P>LASTLY, if we con&s;ider that the words now before
us are a parenthe&s;is, and that St. <HI>Luke</HI> calls the enrol|ment
or cen&s;us he was &s;peaking of, the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> we cannot
well doubt, but that the original intention of them was,
in &s;ome manner or other, to di&s;tingui&s;h this enrolment,
which was now made in the reign of <HI>Herod,</HI> from that,
which was afterwards made when <HI>Archelaus</HI> was ba|ni&s;hed.</P>
<P>HE that will &s;eriou&s;ly con&s;ider all the&s;e particulars,
will have no &s;u&s;picions, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has made any
mi&s;take.</P>
<P>IF then the &s;en&s;e, which is now ordinarily given the&s;e
words, is not con&s;i&s;ent with truth, it is highly rea&s;ona|ble
to conclude, that either we do not take the true
meaning of them, or el&s;e that &s;ome &s;mall alteration or
other has happened in the text of St, <HI>Luke.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. IV. BUT though what has been here offered, and
which has al&s;o been in the main alleged before by tho&s;e
who have con&s;idered this place, be &s;ufficient to take
away the force of this objection; yet I pre&s;ume, it will
<PB N="392" REF="410">
be expected, I &s;hould give &s;ome account of the particu|lar
&s;olutions that have been offered by learned men. This
I &s;hall do, and then endeavour to &s;upport or improve
that which appears to me the faire&s;t.</P>
<P>1. ONE &s;olution propo&s;ed by<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">In loc.</NOTE> <HI>Calvin,</HI> and much
approved by <HI>Salmeron</HI> and <HI>Baronius,</HI> is, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
was mi&s;taken in the account which he has given of <HI>Cy|renius.</HI>
The two la&s;t mentioned writers e&s;pecially are
of opinion, that we need pay little regard to <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI>
who&s;e hi&s;tory, they. &s;ay, abounds with mi&s;takes and
fal&s;hoods<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Prae&s;tat ut Jo&s;ephi ver&ograve; fidem &amp; hi&s;toriam de|&s;eramas, tanquam incertam, &amp; fluctuantem &amp; veritati in multis di&s;&s;en|tientem. Salmeron in Evang. T. iii. Tractat. 32.</NOTE> And <HI>Baronius</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Sicque contra Jo&s;ephi deliria certo appareret, &s;ub Augu&s;to impentore, vivente Herode &s;eniore, reperiri duplicem, immo triplicem Quirinii in Syria praefecturam. Baron. Ann. A. D. 3. Vid. &amp; app. ad An. num. 80-86.</NOTE> has taken &s;ome pains
to make out a new &s;eries of the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Gover|nours
of <HI>Syria</HI> about this time. For he thinks, that
<HI>Cyrenius</HI> was twice, if not thrice, pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria.</HI>
But this project can be but little approved by learned
men at pre&s;ent. No one that reads <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> without pre|judice,
and that con&s;iders he had before him the hi&s;tory
of <HI>Herod</HI>'s, reign writ by <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus,</HI> who was
a learned man, <HI>Herod</HI>'s favourite, and employed by
him in affairs of government, can make any doubt, but
that <HI>Quintilius Varus</HI> was Governour of <HI>Syria</HI> when <HI>He|rod</HI>
died; that C. <HI>Sentius Saturninus</HI> was his predece&s;&s;or,
and was in the province at le&s;t two or three years; and
that <HI>M. Titius</HI> was pre&s;ident before him. With all
the&s;e Governours of <HI>Syria Herod</HI> had &s;ome concerns.
What <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has &s;aid of them may likewi&s;e be con|firmed
in a great mea&s;ure from other authors<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vid. Nori&s;. Cenot. Pi&s;. Di&s;&s;. ii. cap. 16. &sect; 9, 10.</NOTE> So
thas there is no room for <HI>Cyrenius</HI> at thistime.</P>
<P>NOR can there well be any que&s;tion made, but that
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has given us, in the main, a true account of
the enrolment or cen&s;us made by <HI>Cyrenius</HI> after <HI>Arche|laus</HI>'s
bani&s;hment. It appears from the manner, in
which <HI>Gamaliel</HI> &s;peaks of the <HI>taxing</HI> when <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Gali|lee</HI>
<PB N="393" REF="411">
ro&s;e up, that this was a remarkable event. And the
account <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> gives of it may a&s;&s;ure us, this was an
affair all men were then well acquainted with. The di|&s;turbance rai&s;ed by <HI>Judas</HI> was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, but yet the
principle &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. It was the occa&s;ion of much unea&s;i|ne&s;&s;e
under the Roman government, and many were at
times puni&s;hed on account of it<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Jo&s; Ant. l. xviii. cap. I. &sect;. 6.</NOTE></P>
<P>2. ANOTHER &s;olution propo&s;ed by <HI>Calvin</HI><NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Ubi &s;upra.</NOTE> and
which <HI>Vale&s;ius</HI><NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Vid. Notas ad Eu&s;eb. Hi&s;t. Ec. lib. i. cap. 5.</NOTE> judges to be the mod commodious of
any, is, that the decree of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was i&s;&s;ued in the lat|ter
end of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign; but that for &s;ome rea&s;on or
other the cen&s;us could not be made, or at left not fi|ni&s;hed till the time that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was Governour of <HI>Syria,</HI>
ten or twelve years afterwards.</P>
<P>BUT this is to make St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;peak very improperly
and confu&s;edly, of what he &s;ays of <HI>Cyrenius.</HI> And it
is directly contrary to what follows. Having related,
that there <HI>went out a decree from</HI> Ce&s;ar Augu&s;tus, <HI>that
all the world &s;hould be taxed,</HI> he &s;ubjoins: <HI>and all went to
be taxed exery one in his own city.</HI> And there was &s;o great
a re&s;ort at this time at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> upon this account, that
<HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> were obliged to take up with very in|different
accommodations: <HI>there was no room for them in
the inn.</HI></P>
<P>3. SOME think that in&s;tead of <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> we ought
to read <HI>Saturninus;</HI> becau&s;e, according to <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> he
was Prefect of <HI>Syria,</HI> within a year or two before <HI>Herod</HI>
died; and <HI>Tertullian</HI> &s;ays this cen&s;us was made by him.
This is one of the &s;olutions propo&s;ed by<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Ubi &s;upra.</NOTE> <HI>Vale&s;ius,</HI>
though he rather approves that la&s;t mentioned. But
again&s;t this, it has been ob&s;erved by many learned men,
that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> is in all our copies of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and appears
to have been there before <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s time; &s;ince <HI>Ju&s;tin
Martyr</HI> &s;ays expre&s;sly, that this cen&s;us was made by
<HI>Cyrenius,</HI></P>

ea&s;y and probable conjecture, that originally the name
in St. <HI>Luke</HI> was <HI>Quintilius. Quintilius. Varus</HI> &s;ucceeded
<HI>Saturninus,</HI> and was in the province of <HI>Syria,</HI> when <HI>He|rod</HI>
died. The cen&s;us afterwards made by <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was
certainly bed known, and &s;ome ignorant tran&s;criber
might therefore imagine <HI>Quintilius</HI> a mi&s;take, and pre|tend
to correct the original by in&s;erting <HI>Cyrenius</HI> in his
room. Be&s;ides, the alteration of <HI>Quintilius</HI> to <HI>Cyrenius,</HI>
is a change of only a few<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> letters, and therefore
might the more ea&s;ily happen.</P>
<P>BUT this &s;olution is liable to the &s;ame objection with
the former, <HI>viz.</HI> that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> is in all the copies of the
<HI>Greek</HI> original, and in all the ancient ver&s;ions. And
be&s;ides, has this di&s;advantage, that this cen&s;us St. <HI>Luke</HI>
&s;peaks of is not a&s;cribed to <HI>Quintilius Varus</HI> by any anci|ent
Chri&s;tian writer whatever, whereas <HI>Saturninus</HI> has
been mentioned by <HI>Tertullian.</HI></P>

and figures.&mdash;Nay in <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> in the words directly
appo&s;ite to this matter, the verb to <HI>tax</HI> is oftentimes
to lay an imputation, while the noun a <HI>Tax</HI> is the levy
of money only.&endq;</P>
<P>BUT (I.) Mr. <HI>W&mdash;n's</HI> Argument from the u&s;e of
nouns and verbs is not valid here. He &s;ays; &startq;by cu|&s;tom
a noun of the &s;ame original with a verb does va|ry
in &s;ignification from it.&endq; This may be, and there
may be many in&s;tances of it. But it had been much
more material to give an example or two of the u&s;e of
the noun <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> for a <HI>Tax,</HI> namely in the &s;en&s;e in which
he here under&s;tands it. This he has not done, and I
pre&s;ume no &s;uch example can be alleged from any <HI>Greek</HI>
author.</P>
<P>I KNOW of but two or at the mo&s;t three &s;en&s;es in
which this noun is u&s;ed, which can have any relation to
this matter.</P>
<P>[1.] IT is u&s;ed for the act of the people in pre&s;enting
them&s;elves to be enrolled. As when &s;oldiers offered
them&s;elves to be inli&s;ted<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See above, P. 347. n. l.</NOTE> or enrolled under a Gene|ral,
And in a cen&s;us it may be u&s;ed for the act of the
people who come and offer them&s;elves to be enrolled and
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. So the word &s;eems to be u&s;ed by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> when
he &s;ays in the place above quoted, that <HI>Judas</HI> per&s;waded
not a few<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> B. J. l. vii. P. 1343. 40.</NOTE> of the <HI>Jews</HI> not to make enrolments or
entries; that is, not to offer them&s;elves to be entered
and a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>[2.] THE word is u&s;ed for a cen&s;us. So it is u&s;ed
by <HI>Dio</HI> in many places: <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is the &s;ame
as <HI>cen&s;um agere;</HI> that is, to make enrolments, is the
&s;ame as to make a cen&s;us<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> 557. B. vid. etiam jam citat. Pag. 496. C. 508. B. C.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="396" REF="414">
[3.] THIS noun is u&s;ed for the public Rolls or Court
Books, in which the entries were made: This &s;en&s;e of
the word is very common. Thus <HI>Caligula</HI> being at play
at dice, and having lo&s;t all his money, he asked for the
<HI>Gallic</HI> court rolls<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> <HI>Dio.</HI> L. 59. P. 657. B.</NOTE> and ordered &s;everal of the mo&s;t
wealthy of that people to be put to death, and &s;ei&s;ed
their ca&s;h. And the Citizens of <HI>Rome,</HI> who&s;e debts
were more than they could di&s;charge, having entred the
&s;ums they owed in Books opened for that purpo&s;e, <HI>Ser|vius Tullius</HI> took the Books or Rolls, [<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">]
brought them into the <HI>Forum,</HI> and paid the cre|ditors<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Dion. Hal. l. iv. c. 10. P. 207. 23.</NOTE></P>
<P>THUS I have reckoned up all the &s;en&s;es I know of
this noun, relating to this matter. However it never
&s;ignifies a <HI>tax.</HI> Taxes were paid according to the cen|&s;us,
where any had been made: but they were no part
of it. They might be remitted, or demanded. And
the tribute is never expre&s;&s;ed by the noun <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">,
but is ever di&s;tingui&s;hed from what that &s;ignifies.</P>
<P>(2.) THIS interpretation of the&s;e words is contrary
to matter of fact. There was no tax levied after the
bani&s;hment of <HI>Archelaus</HI> according to the enrolment
made at the birth of our Saviour. But as &s;oon as <HI>Anche|laus</HI>
was bani&s;hed, &startq;<HI>Cyrenius</HI> came into <HI>Judea</HI> to make
an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement of their goods.&endq; <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> is as expre&s;s in
this matter as can be<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Ant. l. xviiii. c. I.</NOTE>. &startq;Then it was that <HI>Judas</HI> of
<HI>Galilee</HI> and his followers exclaimed, that an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement
would bring in among them downright &s;lavery<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Id. Ibid.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS interpretation therefore is &s;o far from being of
any &s;ervice to us, that it would introduce a new, and I
think, in&s;uperable difficulty, by putting upon the&s;e
words a &s;en&s;e directly contrary to what <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has &s;aid.</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="415">
<HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> is &s;o expre&s;s, that there &s;eems no
need of rea&s;oning upon the matter, to confute this &s;up|po&s;ition. But I can never conceive, how a tax could
be levyed in <HI>Judea,</HI> after the removal of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> up|on
the cen&s;us or enrolment made at our Saviour's birth,
without the utmo&s;t confu&s;ion, or the utmo&s;t inju&s;tice.
When the enrolment which St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;peaks of was
made, <HI>Galilee, Trachonitis,</HI> and other countries were &s;ub|ject
to <HI>Herod,</HI> be&s;ide <HI>Judea;</HI> many who lived in <HI>Galilee</HI>
enrolled them&s;elves in <HI>Judea,</HI> particularly <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> as
St. <HI>Luke</HI> allures us. But when <HI>Archelaus</HI> was bani&s;hed,
one half of <HI>Herod</HI>'s Dominions was in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Herod</HI> the Tetrarch and <HI>Philip,</HI> and had been &s;o ever
&s;ince the death of <HI>Herod</HI> called the Great. And only
<HI>Judea, Samaria</HI> and <HI>Idumea,</HI> which had been &s;ubject to
<HI>Archelaus,</HI> were thrown into the form of a Roman pro|vince. The <HI>Jews</HI> having enrolled them&s;elves according
to their families at the time of our Saviour's nativity,
and many having come into <HI>Judea</HI> properly &s;o called
from <HI>Galilee</HI> and other parts of <HI>Herod</HI>'s territories, a
new enrolment was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary in <HI>Judea</HI> at the
time of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s removal, if they were to pay tri|bute there in the way of a cen&s;us. <HI>Judea</HI> otherwi&s;e
mu&s;t have been very much over burdened. If there
was an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement of goods made at the latter end of
<HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, undoubtedly <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s &s;tock at <HI>Nazareth</HI>
was entered and rated at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> And as the <HI>Jews</HI>
in that part of the world were chiefly of the tribes of
<HI>Judab</HI> and <HI>Benjamin,</HI> the inhabitants of <HI>Galilee,</HI> and
<HI>Trachonitis,</HI> &amp;c. mu&s;t have very generally enrolled
them&s;elves in towns that belonged to the provine of <HI>Ju|dea.</HI>
But it would have been very unrea&s;onable in the
<HI>Romans,</HI> to demand tribute of the people of <HI>Judea,</HI>
properly &s;o called, for e&s;tates and goods, which were
in the territories of the Tetrarchs <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P>AND we are a&s;&s;ured, that the <HI>Romans</HI> did u&s;e to act
equitably, and with great exactne&s;&s;e in the&s;e matters.
Many of the Roman Citizens had been for a long time
oppre&s;&s;ed with the weight of their debts. A way hav|ing

which has been under&s;tood by &s;ome in the &s;ame &s;en&s;e,

in&s;tances, though it is not alleged by them. <HI>Now the
fir&s;t day of the fea&s;t of unleavened bread,</HI> Mat. xxvi. 17.
Mark xvi. 12. This was the fourteenth day of the
month: but it is argued here, that the 15th day was
the fir&s;t day of the fea&s;t of unleavened bread; for <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
&s;ays, that the 16th day of the month was<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. 3. c. 10. p. 124. v. 20.</NOTE> the
&s;econd day of the fea&s;t. And the words of the Law
agree herewith. <HI>And in the fourteenth day of the fir&s;t
month is the pa&s;&s;over of the Lord. And in the fifteenth day
of this month is the fea&s;t. Seven days &s;hall unleavened
bread be eaten,</HI> Numb, xxviii. 16, 17. Sec <HI>Exod.</HI> xii. 18.
The fourteenth day therefore was the day of the Pa&s;&s;o|ver.
The fea&s;t of unleavened bread was di&s;tinct from
it, and la&s;ted &s;even days from the 14th at night. The
fifteenth day of the month was the fir&s;t of unleavened
bread. Therefore when the Evangeli&s;ts, &s;peaking of
the 14th day, &s;ay, it was <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, they mean
not the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> day of unleavened bread, but the day <HI>be|fore</HI>

ought to be laid upon this rule in this ca&s;e, I know not.
I am &s;atisfied we do not need it. The <HI>Pa&s;&s;over</HI> was
&s;trictly &s;peaking di&s;tinct from the fea&s;t of <HI>unleavened

<PB N="410" REF="428">
day of the pa&s;&s;over. But their hou&s;es were clean&s;ed
from all leaven on the morning of the day on which the
pa&s;chal Lamb was &s;lain, and therefore after noon they
could cat no leavened bread. For this rea&s;on, perhaps,
the day of the pa&s;&s;over was called the fir&s;t of unleavened
bread. But whatever was the rea&s;on of it, it is certain,
that the pa&s;&s;over and the fea&s;t of unleavened bread are
often taken promi&s;cuou&s;ly the one for the other. And
tho' <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> in the particular account of the in&s;titution,

According to this method of computation, the 14th day
was the fir&s;t of unleavened bread. So that when the Pa&s;|&s;over
and fea&s;t of unleavened bread were con&s;idered as
one, (as they were very often) and the whole was called
by the fea&s;t of unleavened bread, the fourteenth day mu&s;t

more at length then <HI>Herwaert</HI> has done. And if the
reader will con&s;ider the whole of it, I think he will be
convinced: 1&s;t, That by <HI>Socratic dialogues</HI> is here meant,
not <HI>Plato</HI>'s <HI>dialogues</HI> in which he introduces <HI>Socrates,</HI> but

<PB N="413" REF="431">
&s;elf, that it is the real &s;en&s;e of the text for the following
rea&s;ons.</P>
<P>1. THIS is a very uncommon u&s;e of the word <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
This, I think, is evident, in that the Critics have been &s;o
much at a lo&s;&s;e for in&s;tances. <HI>Stevens</HI> knew of none<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> pri&ugrave;s. Alexander Aphrodi&s;ius, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.

that produced above from <HI>Aphrodi&s;ius,</HI> where <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">

other ways of expre&s;&s;ing this priority of time<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> [adverb.] <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &amp;c.</NOTE> The rea|&s;on
of the <HI>Greek</HI> writers &s;o rarely u&s;ing this word thus is ve|ryobvious:
It can hardly be done without cau&s;ing &s;ome
ambiguity; therefore when they u&s;e it in this &s;en&s;e, we
&s;ee they often &s;ubjoin <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. That this u&s;e of <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> was
de&s;ignedly avoided, &s;eems to me evident from a pa&s;&s;age
of <HI>Herodotus;</HI> where having in the former branch of the
&s;entence twice u&s;ed the &s;uperlative, in the latter he takes
the comparative; either to avoid ambiguity, or as more
agreeable to the genius of the <HI>Greek</HI> language<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Herodot. 1. 2. init. The <HI>Egyptians</HI> before the reign of <HI>P&s;ammetichus</HI> thought them&s;elves the fir&s;t [or mo&s;t ancient] of all peo|ple. But &s;ince the reign of <HI>P&s;ammetichus,</HI> who made an experiment for finding out who were the fir&s;t of all people, they have thought that the <HI>Phrygians</HI> were before them, they before others.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2. It does not appear that any of the fir&s;t <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>
under&s;tood St. <HI>Luke</HI> in this &s;en&s;e. That they did not &s;o
interpret this text, we are a&s;&s;ured from the <HI>Syriac, Vul|gate,</HI>
and other Ver&s;ions; from <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr, Eu&s;ebius,</HI>

<P>THEY &s;uppo&s;e, that when <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had i&s;&s;ued his

to make the cen&s;us in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Judea:</HI> And <HI>Saturninus</HI>
or <HI>Quintilius Varus,</HI> which &s;oever of them was then Pre&s;i|dent,
was joined with him: and was &s;ubordinate to him,
or had equal power with him in this particular work.
<HI>Cyrenius</HI> therefore having at this time &s;ome power in <HI>Sy|ria,</HI>
he is called Pre&s;ident of it, though he was not pro|perly
Pre&s;ident or the ordinary chief magi&s;trate of that
province.</P>
<P>IN order to ju&s;tify this &s;olution two things are to be
con&s;idered: 1. Whether <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> though not proper|ly
Pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria,</HI> may be called &s;o in a loo&s;e and
general &s;en&s;e: 2. It mu&s;t be &s;hewn, that it is not unlike|ly,

that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> might be &s;ent upon this affair at this

<P>As to the fir&s;t point, it is alleged, that the title of
<HI>Governour</HI> or <HI>Pre&s;ident</HI> is often given to others be&s;ide
tho&s;e who are properly po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that dignity. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>

<P>THAT <HI>Cyrenius</HI> might be &s;ent upon this affair with

was a di&s;tinct charge from that of the Con&s;uls and Prae|tors,
the ordinary magi&s;trates. The &s;urveys in pro|vinces
al&s;o were often performed not by the ordinary go|vernours
but by per&s;ons &s;ent thither with extraordinary

<P>As <HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s expedition again&s;t the forementioned

<P>CYRENIUS was not appointed Governour to <HI>Caius

<P>LET us proceed. When St. <HI>Luke</HI> calls <HI>Cyrenius Go|vernour
of Syria,</HI> I under&s;tand the words in the &s;trict
and proper &s;en&s;e. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is not the geni|tive
ca&s;e ab&s;olute, or governed by <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> under&s;tood, and
to be con&s;trued, <HI>Cyrenius being gevernour of Syria,</HI> or
<HI>when Cyrenius was governour of Syria;</HI> but it is governed
by <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. They do not expre&s;s any time at all. But
this is <HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s title, the title, by which he was well
known in that part of the world. As we &s;ay, <HI>Antony</HI>
the <HI>Triumvir,</HI> or <HI>Cato</HI> the Cen&s;or, to di&s;tingui&s;h them
from others of the &s;ame names. <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>&amp;c.</HI>
is with me the &s;ame thing, as if St. <HI>Luke</HI> had &s;aid,
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that <HI>Greek</HI> Authors delight very much
in the u&s;e of participles; and, I think, more e&s;pecially
when they &s;peak of titles and dignities. Thus <HI>Cicero,</HI>
in<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Lib. 43. P. 250. D.</NOTE> <HI>Dio,</HI> &s;ays: &startq;We expect that our Praetors and

<P>THESE participles &s;eem to me to be &s;ometimes &s;ub|&s;tantives,

all are &s;en&s;ible that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> is &s;o u&s;ed. Some of tho&s;e

&s;eem to me to be very near, or altogether parallel

<P><PB N="421" REF="439">
BUT let <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> be a mere participle; only
then it will be &s;aid: If it be governed by <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> it
ought to have been <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. To this I an&s;wer,
that undoubtedly <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> would have been very
proper, but &s;o is al&s;o <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. It is no uncommon
thing for <HI>Greek</HI> authors to u&s;e the, Pre&s;ent ten&s;e for the
fir&s;t Aori&s;t. I give an in&s;tance or two that may fully
ju&s;tify my interpretation. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays: And it is cer|tain
&startq;that <HI>Varus</HI> was of a Royal Family, &s;ince he was
a de&s;cendant of <HI>Soemus</HI> who was Tetrarch of a coun|try
near mount<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Pag. 909. v. 20.</NOTE> <HI>Libanus.&endq; <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">

from <HI>Latinus</HI> a King of that country<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. R. lib. 2. p. 76. v. 24.</NOTE>. If any
&s;hould &s;ay, it is improper to under&s;tand this parti||ciple,
as I do, becau&s;e <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was not Governour of
<HI>Syria</HI> till after the time in which St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s &s;urvey was
made, I add one example more, which mu&s;t fully ob|viate
this exception. <HI>Herodian</HI> &s;ays, &startq;That to <HI>Marcus</HI>
the Emperour were born &s;everal daughters<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. init.</NOTE> and
two &s;ons.&endq; <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Yet &s;everal of tho&s;e children were
born to him before he was Emperour. This in&s;tance
&s;hews plainly, that the&s;e participles do not always im|port
only the time when men are in office.</P>
<P>I HOPE this is &s;ufficient to &s;hew, that <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">
is the &s;ame as <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> at le&s;t that it is governed by
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. The &s;uppo&s;ing <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> to be the
Genitive ab&s;olute, or governed by <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, as it has given
occa&s;ion for the objection we are now upon, &s;o it &s;eems
to have carried mo&s;t learned men off from the right
way of &s;olving it.</P>
<P>I APPREHEND I have now ju&s;tified my interpreta|tion
of every part of this ver&s;e: <HI>This was the fir&s;t A&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ement</HI>
(or &s;urvey) <HI>of</HI> Cyrenius <HI>the Governour of</HI> Syria,
or <HI>of</HI> Cyrenius <HI>who was Governour of</HI> Syria.</P>
<P><PB N="422" REF="440">
BUT if any choo&s;e rather to take <HI>Scaliger</HI>'s method,
as to the fir&s;t part of the ver&s;e, I &s;hall not contend
about that, provided my &s;en&s;e of the later part be ad|mitted.
Then the interpretation will &s;tand thus: This
&s;urvey was the fir&s;t [<HI>&s;urvey</HI>] of <HI>Cyrenius</HI> the Governour
of <HI>Syia.</HI></P>
<P>NOR can I &s;ee any rea&s;on why all tho&s;e who follow
<HI>Beza,</HI> and &s;uppo&s;e that this &s;urvey was made by <HI>Cyre|nius,</HI>
as well as that made after <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s removal,
&s;hould not receive this interpretation. When they come

<P>SOME time after I had been per&s;waded this was the

great deal of plea&s;ure, though it does not appear how
this acute and learned man under&s;tood <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.&mdash;
But I have &s;ince met with a more explicite authority for
my way of tran&s;lating <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. The title of <HI>Ori|gen</HI>'s
xith Homily upon St. <HI>Luke,</HI> in the <HI>Latin</HI> edition of
his works, is thus: <HI>De eo quod &s;criptum e&s;t, Puer autem
<PB N="423" REF="441">

words to the &s;ame effect.</P>
<P>THE ver&s;ion I here offer does not only appear to me
a very natural and obvious meaning of the words, but
it is very good &s;en&s;e, and extremely &s;uitable to their po|&s;ition
in a parenthe&s;is. <HI>In tho&s;e days there went out a decree
from</HI> Ce&s;ar Augu&s;tus <HI>that all the world</HI> [Land] <HI>&s;hould be
taxed.</HI> (<HI>This was the fir&s;t a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement of</HI> Cyrenius <HI>the Gover|nour
of</HI> Syria.) It is needle&s;s to ob&s;erve, that if this ver|&s;ion
be allowed, the objection we are con&s;idering va|ni&s;hes.
There is no colour or preten&s;e to &s;ay, that St.
<HI>Luke</HI> confounded the cen&s;us or &s;urvey, made in the
time of <HI>Herod,</HI> with that made after the removal of
<HI>Archelaus.</HI></P>
<P>&sect;. VI. I APPREHEND there lies now no objection
again&s;t St. <HI>Luke,</HI> but what may ari&s;e from the doubts
which &s;ome may have in their minds, concerning <HI>Cyre|nius</HI>
being the officer employed in making this &s;urvey.
I wi&s;h the reader be not quite tired with this long &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion
of critici&s;ms. But whether he will accompany me
any farther or not, I think my &s;elf obliged to take into
con&s;ideration all the difficulties which attend this parti|cular
circum&s;tance.</P>
<P>HERE I adopt at once all that has been already of|fered
by tho&s;e who embrace <HI>Beza</HI>'s &s;olution, to make
it appear probable, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> performed the cen&s;us
of which St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;peaks. But now I enjoy a peculiar
advantage above tho&s;e learned men, in the &s;uppo&s;ition
I advanced at fir&s;t, that this cen&s;us of <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was of
<HI>Judea</HI> only. They think, that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s decree ex|tended
to the whole Empire; and that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was &s;ent
with extraordinary power to make the cen&s;us in <HI>Syria</HI>
and <HI>Judea.</HI> But they &s;uppo&s;e, (and indeed they are
obliged to allow it) that <HI>Saturninus</HI> was joyned with
him, if <HI>Saturninus</HI> was then pre&s;ident. This has given
<PB N="224" REF="442">
<HI>Perizonius</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ert. de Aug. De&s;crip. &sect;. 15, 16, 17.</NOTE> a fine advantage again&s;t their &s;uppo&s;ition,
that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was concerned in this cen&s;us. To give <HI>Cy|renius</HI>
&s;uperior or equal power to <HI>Saturninus</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI>
the province of which he was the ordinary governour,
would have been an affront; e&s;pecially con&s;idering that
<HI>Saturninus</HI> was equal to <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> in every re&s;pect, and
&s;uperior to him in &s;ome: for he was of a better family,
and the elder Con&s;ul by &s;even years. And it is no le&s;s
injurious to <HI>Cyrenius</HI> to put him under <HI>Saturninus.</HI></P>
<P>I AM not at all concerned with this. I think <HI>Cyre|nius</HI>
performed the cen&s;us alone, by virtue of the extra|ordinary
power with which he was &s;ent. But if any are
inclined to think, that <HI>Saturninus</HI> was joined in the com|mi&s;&s;ion
with him, this would be no di&s;paragement to
<HI>Saturninus.</HI> To give him authority in a neighbouring
kingdom where he had none before, would not be to
le&s;&s;en him, but to augment his power. Nor do I &s;up|po&s;e,
it could be any di&s;grace to <HI>Cyrenius</HI> to have the
Governour of <HI>Syria</HI> made his partner.</P>
<P>I PROCEED to con&s;ider all the difficulties that can
affect the &s;uppo&s;ition that this cen&s;us was made by <HI>Cy|renius,</HI>
as far as I am concerned with them.</P>
<P>I. IT is &s;aid, that it was not cu&s;tomary for the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
to &s;end any great man twice into the &s;ame country.
Since it is certain from <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> after|wards
made a cen&s;us in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Judea,</HI> it may be con|cluded,
he did not perform that &s;urvey, which St. <HI>Luke</HI>
&s;ays was made in <HI>Judea</HI> at the time of our Saviour's
nativity<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Multis de cau&s;is di&s;plicet nobis gemina haec Cyrenii de&s;criptio. Bis ad eandem rem Quirinium in Syriam fui&s;&s;e mi&s;&s;um, fidem vir imperat, nec Romanos ad mores quadrat. Ba&s;nage. Ann. Pol, Ecc. ant. Dom. 5. num. 14.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer: I allow, that it was not u&s;ual for

<P>I WILL give an undeniable example of an officer's be|ing

ab&s;urdity at all in &s;uppo&s;ing, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was &s;ent by
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> with extraordinary power at the latter end of
<HI>Herod</HI>'s reign to make a &s;urvey in <HI>Judea,</HI> and that about
ten or twelve years afterwards he came as the ordinary
governour into <HI>Syria,</HI> and then made a cen&s;us in that
province and in <HI>Judea</HI> annexed to it.</P>
<P>2. IT is objected, that none of the <HI>Roman</HI> or <HI>Greek.</HI>
hi&s;torians, tho' <HI>Cyrenius</HI> has been &s;poken of by &s;everal
of them, have taken any notice of this cen&s;us.</P>
<P>I ANSWER, that this is no difficulty at all. I &s;up|po&s;e,
that no one will make any que&s;tion, but that <HI>Cy|renius</HI>
made an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement in <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Judea,</HI> when he
was &s;ent pre&s;ident into <HI>Syria,</HI> becau&s;e we have <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s

action of his, omitted by all the re&s;t: If indeed
he means our <HI>Cyrenius.</HI></P>
<P>3. BUT it will be &s;aid: It maybe certainly concluded
from the account which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has given of the Cen|&s;us
made<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">See the account above, p. 386.</NOTE> by <HI>Cyrenius</HI> after <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s bani&s;hment,
that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> had never been in <HI>Judea</HI> or enrolled the

omitted to take notice of it then.</P>
<P>I OWN, that at fir&s;t &s;ight this mu&s;t appear a very con|&s;iderable difficulty.</P>
<P>BUT it ought to be ob&s;erved, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> does
not particularly name any of <HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s honours or &s;er|vices,

in tho&s;e memoirs or hi&s;tories which he made u&s;e of. He
had &s;aid nothing of it, had it not been for a mo&s;t re|markable
di&s;turbance in <HI>Herod</HI>'s court and family, with
which it had a connexion.</P>
<P>AND any one may perceive, that it is then touched
upon very &s;lightly. Is it not &s;trange that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;hould
not name the officer that took the oath for <HI>Augu&s;tus?</HI>
No one can make any doubt, but there was &s;ome per|&s;on
of eminence deputed by the Emperour for that
work. As <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> did not mention him then, I &s;hould
never expect to find his name afterwards. And who|ever
can account for <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s omi&s;&s;ions relating to the
affair of the oath, may account for his &s;ilence in this
pa&s;&s;age, tho' <HI>Cyrenius</HI> had been once before in <HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>(3.) I THINK that arguments formed upon the omi&s;|&s;ions
of Hi&s;torians are of very little weight. There are
in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> other omi&s;&s;ions as remarkable as this. I de|&s;ire
to con&s;ider the account he gives, in his <HI>War of the
Jews,</HI> of the reducing <HI>Judea</HI> to a province. &startq;<HI>Arche|laus</HI>'s
country being reduced to a province, <HI>Coponius</HI>
a man of the <HI>Eque&s;trian</HI> rank among the <HI>Romans</HI> was
&s;ent Procurator, being inve&s;ted with the power of life
and death. In his time [<GAP DESC="FOREIGN">] a certain <HI>Galilean,</HI>
who&s;e name was <HI>Judas,</HI> excited the people to a rebel|lion,
telling them, That they were of a mean &s;pirit,
if they could endure to pay tribute to the <HI>Romans,</HI> and
acknowledge mortal men for their Lords after God
had been their King. This man was the head of a
di&s;tinct &s;ect in nothing like<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">De Bell. Lib. ii. cap. 8. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> the re&s;t.&endq; This is all
he &s;ays. He does not &s;ay there was now any cen&s;us

made, has not one word of <HI>Cyrenius</HI> or his coming into
<HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>IT is true, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has in two other places in
the <HI>War of the Jews</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 17. &sect;. 8. &amp; l. 7. c. 8. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> occa&s;ionally mentioned <HI>Cyre|nius,</HI>
and in the later of tho&s;e places, his cen&s;us al&s;o,
But it mu&s;t be allowed to be a very great omi&s;&s;ion, not
to do this in the proper place, in the account of the re|duction
of <HI>Judea</HI> to the &s;tate of a province. This might
have been rea&s;onably expected in the hi&s;tory of the
War, when this a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement made by <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> and the
principles broached at that time, were main founda|tions
of it.</P>
<P>IF it be &s;aid, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> pa&s;&s;ed over this affair
&s;lightly in <HI>the War,</HI> becau&s;e he intended to write his <HI>Anti|quities</HI>
and mention it more particularly then: I an&s;wer,
this is &s;aid without ground. And I might as well &s;ay,
that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> omitted in his <HI>Antiquities</HI> the particular ac|count
of <HI>Cyrenius</HI>'s fir&s;t a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement, becau&s;e he intended
to write afterward another book of the hi&s;tory of the
<HI>Jews,</HI> and go over their affairs once more, as he ex|pre&s;sly
a&s;&s;ures us at the conclu&s;ion of his <HI>Antiquities.</HI></P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> informs us in his <HI>Life,</HI> writ after <HI>the
War,</HI> and <HI>the Antiquities,</HI> that the <HI>Jews</HI> had a battle
with <HI>Ge&s;&s;ius Florus</HI> their la&s;t Procurator, and killed him
and a good many of his men; and that this victory
was fatal to them: Fora&s;much as this determined them
to the war with the<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. in Vit. &sect;. 6.</NOTE> <HI>Romans.</HI> Is it not &s;trange that
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;hould &s;ay nothing of this in the hi&s;tory of <HI>the

and a&s;cribed the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> unea&s;ine&s;&s;e under the Roman Go|vernment

<P><PB N="429" REF="447">
THERE is another omi&s;&s;ion appears to me very re|markable.
<HI>Pheroras, Herod</HI>'s younge&s;t brother, is of|ten
mentioned by <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> He has particularly inform|ed
us, that when <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> was in <HI>Syria,</HI> he gave this
<HI>Pheroras</HI> a Tetrarchy<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 15. c. 10. &sect;. 3.</NOTE> at the reque&s;t of <HI>Herod.</HI>
And we are informed by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s retire|ment
into his Tetrarchy, of <HI>Herod</HI>'s vi&s;iting him there,
and of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s dying<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Ibid. l. xvii. c. 3. de B. J. l. i. c. 29.</NOTE> at home, and of his being
brought afterwards from thence to be buried. But yet,
if I mi&s;take not, he has never once &s;aid what this Te|trachy
was, who&s;e it had been before, nor where it lay.
It is true, that whereas in the <HI>Antiquities</HI><NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. p. 756. v. 37.</NOTE> <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
&s;ays, <HI>Pheroras</HI> went to his Tetrarchy; in his <HI>War</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. p. 1031. v. 41. vid. &amp; p. 103 z. v. 26.</NOTE>
he &s;ays, he went to <HI>Peraea,</HI> (or as in &s;ome copies <HI>Pe|traea</HI>):
but <HI>Peraea,</HI> properly &s;o called, could not be
this Tetrarchy, becau&s;e <HI>Peraea</HI> belonged all along to
<HI>Herod.</HI> But this Tetrarchy of <HI>Pheroras</HI> was given him
by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and was di&s;tinct from that e&s;tate or reve|nue
which<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 15. c. 10. &sect;. 3.</NOTE> had been &s;ettled upon him by <HI>Herod.</HI>
The&s;e particulars may convince us, that, though <HI>Cyre|nius</HI>
was in <HI>Judea</HI> in the time of <HI>Herod, Jo&s;ephus</HI> was
capable of omitting to take notice of it.</P>
<P>4. AGAIN, it will be &s;aid: It may be fairly con|cluded
from another place in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> that <HI>Cyrenius</HI>
was but once in <HI>Judea.</HI> For he &s;ays, that &startq;<HI>Ma&s;&s;ada</HI>
was then held by <HI>Eleazar,</HI> the chief man of the <HI>&s;icarii,</HI>
a de&s;cendent of <HI>Judas,</HI> who per&s;waded not a few of
the <HI>Jews</HI> not to enrole them&s;elves, as I have &s;aid<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vid. de Bell. l. z. c. 17. &sect;. 8.</NOTE>

<HI>Judea.</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="430" REF="448">
I OWN it, this is a difficulty, but the argument is
not conclu&s;ive. It is true, that <HI>Judas</HI> made this di&s;tur|bance
when <HI>Cyrenius was &s;ent into</HI> Judea, or in the time
of <HI>Cyrenius:</HI> but it does not follow, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was
&s;ent but once into <HI>Judea.</HI> The <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> will af|ford
us an in&s;tance upon this very &s;ubject which will be
of u&s;e to us. <HI>Camaliel</HI> &s;ays: <HI>After this man ro&s;e up</HI> Judas
<HI>of</HI> Galilee, <HI>in the days of the taxing, and drew away much
people after him,</HI> Acts v. 37. If we had in our hands
this book only of St. <HI>Luke,</HI> namely, <HI>The Acts of the Apo|&s;tles;</HI>
it is not unlikely that many would have &s;uppo&s;ed,
that St. <HI>Luke</HI> knew of no other taxing made in <HI>Judea,</HI>
but that, in the time of which <HI>Judas</HI> ro&s;e up. But we
are a&s;&s;ured from his <HI>Go&s;pel,</HI> that this conclu&s;ion would
have been fal&s;e: for there he has &s;poke very particular|ly
of another, which he calls the <HI>fir&s;t,</HI> or at le&s;t di&s;tin|gui&s;hes
very plainly from &s;ome other.</P>
<P>I MUST be allowed to repeat here once more, that
arguments formed upon the &s;ilence of writers are very
&s;eldom of much moment. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> is the only <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
writer of tho&s;e times, in whom we have the hi&s;tory of
that country: And it cannot be ju&s;tly concluded that
any particular thing was not done, or that &s;uch or &s;uch
a circum&s;tance did not attend it, becau&s;e he has not
mentioned it. All writers have their particular views,
and &s;ome things we are very de&s;irous to know might for
&s;ome rea&s;on or other, which we are ignorant of, lie
without the compa&s;s of their de&s;igns. Be&s;ides, the mo&s;t
accurate and careful hi&s;torians have omitted many facts
or incidents, that might be very properly mentioned,
through forgetfulne&s;&s;e or over&s;ight. I take the omi&s;&s;ion
of the de&s;cription of the Tetrarchy that belonged to
<HI>Pheroras</HI> to be a remarkable in&s;tance of this &s;ort.</P>
<P>5. But it will be &s;aid, that <HI>Tertullian</HI> is po&s;itive, the
cen&s;us in <HI>Judea</HI> at the time of our Saviour's birth was
made by <HI>Sentius Saturninus</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sed &amp; cen&s;us con&s;tat actos &s;ub Augu&s;to nunc in Judaea per Sea|tium Saturninum. Apud quos genus ejus inquirere potui&s;&s;ent. Con$$. Marc, lib, iv. c. 19.</NOTE>.</P>
<P><PB N="431" REF="449">
I ANSWER to this: (1.) It ought to be con&s;idered,
at the Heretic <HI>Marcion,</HI> with whom <HI>Tertullian</HI> di&s;|putes
in this place, did not admit the authority of the
fir&s;t chapter<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Accedit his Cerdon quidam.&mdash;Solum evangelium Lucae, nec tamen totum recipit. Po&s;t hunc di&s;cipulus ip&s;ius emer&s;it Marcion.&mdash;Haere&s;in Cerdonis approbare conatus e&s;t. De prae&s;crip. Haeret. c. 51.</NOTE> of St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s Go&s;pel. And it was the
cu&s;tom of <HI>Tertullian</HI> to argue from tho&s;e parts of &s;crip|ture,
which the Heretics he was dealing with<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Quam &amp; argumentationibus earum, &amp; &s;cripturis quibus utuntur, provocavimus ex abundanti. De carne Chri&s;ti. cap. 25.</NOTE> ac|knowkdged.
Po&s;&s;ibly therefore <HI>Tertullian</HI> having, or
&s;uppo&s;ing he had rea&s;on to think, that this cen&s;us was
made, when <HI>Saturninus</HI> was pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria,</HI> he
might choo&s;e to mention the ordinary officer as a thing
certain: but yet might not intend to affirm that the
cen&s;us was made by him, but only that it happened in
his time. <HI>I&s;aac Ca&s;aubon</HI> judged it not unrea&s;onable &s;o
to under&s;tand <HI>Tertullian,</HI> who often u&s;es words<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Tertullianus cum adver&s;us Marcio. &s;cribit, <HI>Sed &amp; con&s;tat,</HI>&mdash;ad majorem &s;idem magi&s;tratum ordinarium potius nominat, quam ex|traordinarium.

I thought it not fit to deprive the reader of
his an&s;wer of this learned man, But I do not adopt
his interpretation of <HI>Tertullian.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) <HI>TERTULLIAN</HI>'s authority ought not to
outweigh the te&s;timony of more ancient writers, who
were nearer the event. <HI>Ju&s;tin Martyr</HI> in his fir&s;t apo|logy,
pre&s;ented to the <HI>Roman Emperour</HI> &s;ixty years be|fore
<HI>Tertullian</HI> wrote his books again&s;t <HI>Marcion,</HI> &s;ays,
this Cen&s;us was performed in <HI>Judea</HI> by <HI>Cyrenius;</HI> and
all other writers agree with <HI>Ju&s;tin,</HI> as has been &s;hewn
already.</P>
<P>(3.)<HI>TERTULLIAN</HI>'s authority is of the le&s;s
weight in this point, becau&s;e he has made very gro&s;s
blunders in hi&s;tory, of which I &s;hall &s;ay &s;omewhat more
in the <HI>third</HI> chapter.</P>
<P><PB N="432" REF="450">
(4.) I IMAGINE &s;ome account may be given of this
mi&s;take of <HI>Tartullian.</HI> It has been ob&s;erved, that <HI>Mar|cion,</HI>
whom <HI>Tertullian</HI> was now arguing with, did not
own the fir&s;t chapters of St. <HI>Luke</HI>' Go&s;pel. <HI>Tertullian</HI>
therefore not having his eye particularly on St. <HI>Luke,</HI>
and &s;uppo&s;ing that this Cen&s;us was made in <HI>Judea</HI> when
<HI>Saturninus</HI> was pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria,</HI> &s;ays, it was made by
him.</P>
<P><HI>JUDEA</HI> having been afterwards a branch of the
province of <HI>Syria,</HI> he concluded it was &s;o at this time,
and that therefore the Cen&s;us mu&s;t have been made by
the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria.</HI> But this was arguing from later
to more early times, as men not thoroughly ver&s;ed in
hi&s;tory are apt to do.</P>
<P>AFTER the bani&s;hment of <HI>Archelaus Judea</HI> was an|nexed
to <HI>Syria.</HI> But whil&s;t <HI>Herod</HI> was living, the pre&s;i|dent
of <HI>Syria</HI> had not any proper authority in <HI>Judea,</HI>
The Pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria</HI> was always the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble
officer in the Ea&s;tern part of the Empire. When
the <HI>Romans</HI> had any war<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Tum intellecto Barbarorum irri&s;u, qui peterent quod eripue|rant, Con&s;uluit inter primores civitatis Nero, <HI>bellum anceps an pax inhone&s;ta placeret,</HI> nee dubitatum de BELLO.&mdash;&s;cribitur tetrarchi$ ac regibus praefecti&s;que ac procuratoribus,&mdash;<HI>ju&s;&s;is Corbulonis ob&s;equi.

the neighbouring Kings were obliged to follow his di|rections,
to furni&s;h tho&s;e &s;ums of money, or tho&s;e troops
which he required, and to &s;end the&s;e to the places he
appointed. When any differences happened between
the&s;e Kings and Tetrarchs, they were bound to refer
them to him, nor could they march any forces out of
their territories without his con&s;ent. But he &s;eems not,
e&s;pecially in a time of peace, to have had any proper
authority within their dominions.</P>
<P>NOR do I think I here impute to <HI>Tertullian</HI> any very
gro&s;s mi&s;take. The &s;tate of dependent kingdoms and
provinces in the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> underwent frequent
changes. And a per&s;on had need to have made hi&s;tory
his peculiar &s;tudy, and to have aimed at &s;ome uncom|mon
<PB N="433" REF="451">
accuracy, in order to under&s;tand the &s;tate of the
Roman provinces for a couple of centuries.</P>
<P>I HAVE now gone through all the difficulties which
are of any moment in this point.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing farther to add to tho&s;e evidences
which I have already produced, except the&s;e two ob|&s;ervations:
I&s;t, That it &s;eems to me highly probable
from the manner in which <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> &s;peaks of this mat|ter
in his chronicles, that it was originally the common
opinion of Chri&s;tians, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was &s;ent into <HI>Judea</HI>
on purpo&s;e to make this cen&s;us: &startq;In the thirty third
year of <HI>Herod, Cyrenius</HI> being &s;ent by the Roman Se|nate
made a Cen&s;us (or <HI>enrolments</HI>) of goods and per|&s;ons
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Chron. pag. 76.</NOTE>.&endq; This does very much confirm the opinion
of tho&s;e learned men, who think, that <HI>Cyrenius</HI> was &s;ent
with extraordinary power: Though why <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> men|tions
the <HI>Senate</HI> in&s;tead of the <HI>Emperour,</HI> I know not.</P>
<P>POSSIBLY &s;ome may be di&s;po&s;ed to &s;et a&s;ide <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s
authority, becau&s;e in his <HI>Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Hi&s;iory</HI> he has
confounded the two &s;urveys. But I mu&s;t confe&s;&s;e, I a|&s;cribe
that, not to ignorance, but to &s;omewhat a great
deal wor&s;e. It is impo&s;&s;ible, that a man of <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI>'s
acutene&s;&s;e, who had the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
before him, &s;hould think a Cen&s;us made after <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s
bani&s;hment was the &s;ame with that made before <HI>Herod</HI>
died. But <HI>En&s;ebius</HI> was re&s;olved to have St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s hi|&s;tory
confirmed by the expre&s;s te&s;timony of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI>
Hi&s;torian, right or wrong. Here <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> was under a
bia&s;&s;e. In his Chronicle we have a &s;imple unbia&s;&s;ed
account of what was the opinion of Chri&s;tians and others
at that time.</P>
<P><HI>Secondly,</HI> IT &s;eems to me in the nature of the thing
mo&s;t probable, that &s;ome per&s;on was &s;ent with extraor|dinary
power to make this enrolment. There is no evi|dence
in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> had any intention to
take away the kingdome from <HI>Herod</HI> and make <HI>Judea</HI>
a province. A cen&s;us in his dominions was a very great
<PB N="434" REF="452">
di&s;grace. But to have ordered it to be performed by
the Pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria</HI> would have been an additional
affront. It would have looked like making <HI>Herod</HI> &s;ub|ject
to <HI>Syria.</HI> Since <HI>Judea</HI> was to continue a di&s;tinct
kingdome, as hitherto, and only to be reduced to a
more &s;trict dependence, the only method of making
this cen&s;us could be that of &s;ending &s;ome per&s;on of ho|nour
and dignity, like <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> to enrole the &s;ubjects
of <HI>Herod,</HI> and value their e&s;tates, that for the future,
tribute might be paid according to this cen&s;us. And
this does admirably &s;uit the nature of the oath mention|ed
in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> the &s;ub&s;tance of which was to be faith|ful
to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> and <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>I CONCLUDE therefore, that it is upon the whole
mo&s;t probable, that the fir&s;t a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, of which St
<HI>Luke</HI> here writes, was performed by <HI>Cyrenius,</HI> as well
as the &s;econd. This appears to me a very natural mean|ing
of St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s words, and the external evidences &s;o:
this &s;uppo&s;ition &s;eem to me to outweigh the objections.</P>
<P>WE have now got through the affair of the cen&s;us,
If I have not been &s;o happy as to remove every difficul|ty
attending this text of St. <HI>Luke;</HI> yet I hope the rea|der
will allow at le&s;t, that I have not concealed or di&s;|&s;embled
any.</P>

<P>To this I an&s;wer: I. This appears to me to be at

The mod exact and diligent hi&s;torians have omitted
many Events, that happened within the compa&s;&s;e of
tho&s;e times of which they undertook to write. Nor
does the reputation which any one hi&s;torian his for ex|actne&s;&s;e

calling for his &s;i&s;ter <HI>Salome</HI> and her husband <HI>Alexas,</HI> he
told them: &startq;My life is now but &s;hort, I know the di&s;|po&s;itions

<P>IT may be al&s;o proper to ob&s;erve, that almo&s;t all
the executions that I have in&s;tanced in were &s;acrifices to
his &s;tate jealou&s;y, and love of empire. And the &s;laugh|ter,
which St. <HI>Matthew</HI> has given an account of, was
made upon the occa&s;ion of tidings brought to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
of the birth of one who was <HI>King of the Jews.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="438" REF="456">
3. <HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> has given us an account of a
terrible execution made in <HI>Herod</HI>'s court, and at <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI>
about this very time, upon the occa&s;ion of &s;ome
predictions, that God was about to take away the king|dome
from <HI>Herod</HI> I think it was made at the very
&s;ame time with the &s;laughter of the infants. St. <HI>Mat|thew</HI>
relates only what was done at <HI>Bethlehem, Jo&s;ephus</HI>
what happened at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> The &s;ilence of <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
about the former, and of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> about the latter,
may be in a good mea&s;ure accounted for by the&s;e two
or three con&s;iderations.</P>
<P>(I.) ST. <HI>Matthew</HI> was not concerned to relate &s;tate
matters, but barely to give the hi&s;tory of Je&s;us Chri&s;t;
and therefore all that he was obliged to take notice of
upon this occa&s;ion was the attempts made upon the life
of Je&s;us. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s is apolitical hi&s;tory of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
nation, and therefore the executions at Court might be
more &s;uitable to his de&s;ign.</P>
<P>(2.) ALL writers of good &s;en&s;e and candour, who have
writ the hi&s;tory of &s;uch jealous and cruel princes as <HI>He|rod,</HI>
have been obliged, both out of a regard to them|&s;elves,
and their readers, to omit &s;ome of their odious
and offen&s;ive actions, and to pa&s;s by &s;ome parts or cir|cum&s;tances
of tho&s;e tran&s;actions which they mention<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Neque &s;um ignarus, a pleri&s;que &s;criptoribus omi&s;&s;a multorum pericula &amp; pocnas, dam copi&acirc; fati&s;cunt, aut quae ip&s;is nimia &amp; mae&s;ta &s;uerant, ne pari taedio lecturos ad&s;icerent, verentur.

And I cannot help paying a particular re&s;pect to the
Evangeli&s;ts for the many in&s;tances of their candour and
goodne&s;&s;e, and for this in particular, that they have
none of them &s;trove to brand the memory of <HI>Herod,</HI>
who fought the life of Je&s;us, with the many cruelties
of his reign, nor the dreadful circum&s;tances of his death;
and that <HI>Matthew,</HI> who alone has informed us of the
murder of the infants, confined his narration to that,
and pa&s;&s;ed by all the other tokens, which, I doubt not,
<HI>Herod</HI> &s;hewed at this time, of a mo&s;t odious jealou&s;y.</P>
<P>NOR would I blame <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> barely for the omi&s;&s;i|on
of the barbarities committed at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> He has
<PB N="439" REF="457">
related many cruel tran&s;actions of <HI>Herod.</HI> To have re|lated
them all would probably have appear'd &s;pite and ill
will, rather than faithfulne&s;s or impartiality. It is evi|dent,
there were many put to death at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> be&s;ide
tho&s;e he names in the account of that execution. Po&s;&s;i|bly
the omi&s;&s;ion of the murder of the Infants may be
owing to tho&s;e rea&s;ons I have here hinted, namely a fear
of being charged with a de&s;ign to load <HI>Herod</HI> unrea&s;ona|bly,
or a fear of rendering his hi&s;tory di&s;agreeable by
too particular a detaile of cruel actions.</P>
<P>(3.) I HAVE thus far endeavoured to account for <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>'s
&s;ilence in the way of apology for him, and &s;hould
be glad to leave the matter here: but his &s;trange way of
&s;peaking, and that in two<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">One of tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ages with ob&s;ervations upon it may be &s;een above, p. 367. It is the pa&s;&s;age I referred to, p. 172, <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as de&s;erv|ing a <HI>particular attention.</HI> If the reader has not yet ob&s;erved it, I would now recommend it to his peru&s;al. The other pa&s;&s;age will be found toward the later end of &sect;. I. of the next chapter to this. See in the index <HI>Jo&s;ephus, his account of a terrible execution at</HI> Jeru&s;alem.</NOTE> places of his works, of
in execution at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> about this time, though ac|cording
to his own account and acknowledgement it
was very &s;evere and terrible, will not permit me to con|clude
here. Suppo&s;ing then, that execution to have
been made on account of di&s;cour&s;es, which happened
at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> upon the rumour of the birth of Je&s;us, I
think, that &s;ince <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was determined in the main
to vindicate <HI>Herod</HI> upon that occa&s;ion, he was obliged
for his own honour to &s;ay nothing of what was done at
<HI>Bethlehem.</HI> The &s;laughter of the infants from two years
old and under, of a whole city, town, or village, and
the di&s;trict round about it, whatever colours an hi&s;to|rian
might have put upon it, would have appeared to
all mankind, but prejudiced and hardened <HI>Jews,</HI> an
horrid inhumanity.</P>
<P>IN a word, the objection again&s;t this relation of St.
<HI>Matthew</HI> mu&s;t be founded on the &s;ilence of the <HI>Greek</HI>
and <HI>Roman</HI> hi&s;torians, or of <HI>Jo&s;iphus.</HI> As for the &s;i|lence

&s;uppo&s;e people take the&s;e things upon <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s autho|rity.
I cannot conceive how the &s;ingle &s;ilence of <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>
(and of <HI>Ju&s;tus</HI> of <HI>Tiberias</HI> if you plea&s;e to add him)
&s;hould be an objection again&s;t St. <HI>Matthew;</HI> when the
&s;ilence of the <HI>Greeks</HI> and <HI>Syrians,</HI> people that abounded
&s;o much in writers (&s;everal of which are al&s;o &s;till in be|ing)
is no objection again&s;t <HI>Jo&s;ephus:</HI> who has record|ed
many things done by <HI>Herod</HI> for tho&s;e people, of
which they have made no mention, that we know of.</P>
<P>IT has been pretended indeed, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was a
great enemy to <HI>Herod,</HI> and &s;eems willing to tell all his
various acts of cruelty. But this is not certain, for <HI>He|rod</HI>'s
character in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has a mixture of good and
bad. He has related a great many things to his advan|tage,
which can be verified by no other writers. <HI>Herod</HI>
put to death every member of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> great Council
in <HI>Hyrcanus</HI>'s time, except <HI>Hillel</HI> and <HI>Shammai;</HI> yet
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> mentions this very &s;lightly<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Antiq. l. xiv. c. 9. &sect;. 4. xv. I.</NOTE>. He even takes
part with <HI>Herod</HI> again&s;t the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> in an account of
an execution made at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in the later part of his

<PB N="442" REF="460">
might have inducements to &s;hew him &s;avour upon &s;ome
occa&s;ions. <HI>Agrippa</HI> the younger was living, when <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
wrote; and he had &s;ome acquaintance with him,
and obligations to him<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. vit. &sect;. 65.</NOTE>. It was not for the honour
of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation to make a mere mon&s;ter of <HI>Herod,</HI>
who had reigned over them between thirty and forty
years. A particular recital of all <HI>Herod</HI>'s cruelties could
not but make the unea&s;ine&s;&s;e of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> people under
the <HI>Roman</HI> government appear very unrea&s;onable. They
might be thought a &s;trange people who rebelled again&s;t
the <HI>Romans,</HI> and yet had bore with a man who had
&s;pared neither young nor old; who had &s;laughtered all
the members of their great council, and the innocent
infants of a whole town and all its di&s;trict. I have &s;ome|times
thought, that this was really one rea&s;on, why <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
made &s;o flight mention of the cutting off the
members of chat &s;enate. It might al&s;o be &s;ome induce|ment
not to relate the &s;laughter of the infants.</P>
<P>But <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> as a firm <HI>Jew,</HI> had certainly a parti|cular
rea&s;on for pa&s;&s;ing over this event at <HI>Bethlehem:</HI>
He could not mention it without giving the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI>
cau&s;e a great advantage. To write, that <HI>Herod</HI> at the
latter end of his reign had put to death all the young
children at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> on occa&s;ion of a report &s;pread at
<HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that the <HI>King of the Jews</HI> had been newly
born there, would have greatly gratified the Chri&s;tians;
&s;ince it was well known, when he wrote, that about thir|ty
years after the death of <HI>Herod, Je&s;us,</HI> being then
about thirty years of age, had been &s;tiled the <HI>King of
the Jews,</HI> and had been publickly crucified at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>
with that title, and it wax firmly believed by all his
followers that he was the great per&s;on &s;poke of under
that character, and was now advanced to dominion and
power.</P>
<P>NAY, I don't &s;ee how any &s;erious and attentive Hea|then,
who had heard any thing of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> could read a
relation of this event in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> (a <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> hi&s;torian,
known to be no favourer of tho&s;e called <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI>) but
<PB N="443" REF="461">
he mu&s;t be di&s;po&s;ed to think, the <HI>Chri&s;tian</HI> belief de|&s;erved
&s;ome con&s;ideration. For if there was a report
&s;pread at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> the Capital city of <HI>Judea,</HI> that
the <HI>King of the Jews</HI> had been newly born; and if this
report was &s;o far credited, that <HI>Herod,</HI> notwith&s;tanding
his numerous i&s;&s;ue, thought it needful to make away
with all the young children at <HI>Bethlehem,</HI> and its bor|ders,
in order to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion in his own family:
this is at once a &s;trong argument, that the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> ex|pectation
of a great per&s;on to ari&s;e from among them
is no new thing, and that there were &s;ome rea&s;ons to
think that great per&s;on had been born at that time.
Moreover, he mu&s;t al&s;o &s;uppo&s;e it po&s;&s;ible, that the
Child, who&s;e life was aimed at, e&s;caped, notwith&s;tand|ing
the care of <HI>Herod.</HI> For it is plain, he did not cer|tainly
know the child, of whom the di&s;cour&s;e was: if
he had, he would not have given orders for de&s;troying
all the young children under &s;uch an age.</P>
<P>THE more any Heathen knew of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> expec|tations,
or of the &s;tory of <HI>Je&s;us,</HI> either by hear&s;ay
from the <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> or by having looked into any of
the Go&s;pels, the more would he have remarked &s;uch a
relation in this hi&s;torian.</P>
<P>FOR this rea&s;on <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> could by no means be wil|ling

<P>THIS is what I &s;aid of this pa&s;&s;age in the fir&s;t edition.
I would now add: It ought to be allowed, that <HI>Augu|&s;tus</HI>
did pa&s;s this je&s;t upon <HI>Herod,</HI> upon &s;ome occa&s;ion
or other, and that <HI>Macrobius</HI> has given us exactly the
words of the je&s;t. This pa&s;&s;age al&s;o &s;hews, that <HI>Herod</HI>'s
&s;laughter of the infants in <HI>Judea</HI> was a thing well
known in <HI>Macrobius</HI>'s time, and was not conte&s;ted by
Heathens.</P>
<P>IF we could be a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>Macrobius</HI> tran&s;cribed
this whole pa&s;&s;age, not only the je&s;t it &s;elf, but the oc|ca&s;ion
of it likewi&s;e, from &s;ome more ancient author,
it would be a proof, that this event was well known in
that author's time al&s;o. And we &s;hould have a great
deal of rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that author was a Heathen;
becau&s;e'tis mo&s;t likely, that <HI>Macrobius,</HI> a bigotted
Heathen<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">This is very evident from his works. And the reader may &s;ee a full proof of it in the Rev.

writers.</P>
<P>BUT it is po&s;&s;ible, that <HI>Macrobius</HI> found only the
je&s;t in his author, and added the occa&s;ion, having col|lected
it from the common di&s;cour&s;e of the Chri&s;tians of
his time, who frequently &s;poke of this cruel action of
<HI>Herod.</HI> There is &s;ome rea&s;on to &s;u&s;pect this, becau&s;e
'tis very likely that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s reflexion upon <HI>Herod</HI> was
occa&s;ioned by the death of one of tho&s;e &s;ons whom <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
has mentioned; and that it has no relation at all
to the &s;laughter of the infants at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> This &s;u&s;pi|cion
may be farther &s;trengthened by the great agree|ment
of <HI>Macrobius</HI> with St. <HI>Matthew</HI> in the words
he u&s;es concerning the children<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Children within two years of age, which <HI>Herod</HI> King of the <HI>Jews</HI> commanded to be &s;lain.</NOTE> <HI>Macrobius</HI> being
ignorant of <HI>Herod</HI>'s &s;tory, and having heard of the
&s;laughter of the infants; when he met with this je&s;t in
<PB N="446" REF="464">
&s;ome author, concluded there had been &s;ome young
child of <HI>Herod</HI> put to death together with them.</P>
<P>I AM content therefore to leave it a doubtful point
whether <HI>Macrobius</HI> tran&s;cribed this whole pa&s;&s;age, or
the je&s;t only, from &s;ome more ancient author.</P>
<P>UPON the whole then, there lies no objection again&s;t
this relation of St. <HI>Matthew.</HI> There is nothing impro|bable
in the thing it &s;elf, con&s;idering the jealous, cruel
temper of <HI>Herod.</HI> The &s;ilence of <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> or of the
ancient <HI>Greek</HI> and <HI>Roman</HI> hi&s;torians, can be no difficul|ty
with any rea&s;onable per&s;on. This fact is confirmed
by the expre&s;s te&s;timony of very early Chri&s;tian wri|ters,
and by <HI>Macrobius,</HI> a Heathen author in the latter
end of the fourth century; from whom it appears, that
this event was not then conte&s;ted, and that it was even
better known, than the fate of tho&s;e &s;ons of <HI>Herod,</HI>
whom <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays he put to death at man's e&s;tate.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. AN objection, of the like fort with that
have been con&s;idering, may be made again&s;t St. <HI>Luke,</HI>
who &s;ays; <HI>There were pre&s;ent at that &s;ea&s;on, &s;ome that
told him of the</HI> Galileans, <HI>who&s;e blood</HI> Pilate <HI>had mingled
with their &s;acrifices,</HI> Luke xiii. I. It has been thought
&s;trange by &s;ome, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has made no mention of
this event.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this objection, I &s;hall tran&s;cribe a pa&s;|&s;age
of <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> &startq;<HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Galilean</HI> introduced a
fourth &s;ect among the <HI>Jews.</HI> In all other things they
agree with the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> but they have an invincible
love of liberty, and acknowledge God alone their
Lord and Governour. Nor can any kind of death,
or any puni&s;hments of their friends and relations make
them call any man Lord. As many have been wit|ne&s;&s;es
of their immoveable firmne&s;&s;e, I &s;hall &s;ay no
more upon this head: not out of a fear, left my ac|counts
&s;hould be thought incredible, but rather be|cau&s;e
it is not ea&s;y fully to repre&s;ent their contempt
of all kinds of &s;ufferings<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. l. 18. c. I. &sect;. 6.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="447" REF="465">
PERHAPS the <HI>Galileans</HI> mentioned by St. <HI>Luke</HI> were
&s;ome of the followers of the before mentioned <HI>Judas.
Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays he has omitted the greate&s;t part of the
&s;ufferings of &s;ect. I think it is not difficult to
gra&s;&s;e the rea&s;on. <HI>Judas</HI>'s principles were very popu|lar
among the <HI>Jews,</HI> but in the opinion of the <HI>Romans</HI>
they were criminal, as being incon&s;i&s;tent with &s;ub|jection
to their government. And it was next to im|po&s;&s;ible,
for <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> to give a particular account of all
tran&s;action in <HI>Judea</HI> relating to this matter, without
offending the <HI>Jews</HI> his countrymen on the one hand, or
the <HI>Romans</HI> on the other.</P>
<P>BUT whether the <HI>Galileans</HI> in St. <HI>Luke</HI> were men of
this principle, is not certain; nor is it material. For
though they were not, the pa&s;&s;age ju&s;t tran&s;cribed from

<P>BEFORE I &s;tate this objection at length, I would ob|&s;erve, that the true genuine meaning of the&s;e words,

before, <HI>viz.</HI> A. U. 749, then he would be at his
bapti&s;m in the 33d year of his age.</P>
<P>BUT it may be made appear &s;everal ways, that Je&s;us
was born above a year, probably above two years be|fore
<HI>Herod</HI> died.</P>
<P>1. THIS may be inferred from the Evangeli&s;ts them|&s;elves.
For it is very probable that <HI>Herod</HI> lived a year
or more after the murder of the infants. The wi&s;e men
having wor&s;hipped Je&s;us, when they were departed,
<HI>Behold, the angel of the Lord appeared to Jo&s;eph in a
dream, &s;aying, Ari&s;e, and take the young child and his mo|ther
and flee into</HI> Egypt, AND BE THOU THERE UNTIL
I BRING THEE WORD: <HI>for</HI> Herod <HI>will &s;eek the young child
to de&s;troy him. When he aro&s;e, he took the young child and
his mother by night, and departed into</HI> Egypt. <HI>And was
there</HI> UNTIL THE DEATH OF HEROD, <HI>Matth.</HI> ii. 13, 14.
The direction given to <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> by the angel, may af|ford
ground to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was to make &s;ome
&s;tay in <HI>Egypt,</HI> at le&s;t &s;ome months, or more than a few
weeks or days: which, from what follows, appears to
have been <HI>till the death of</HI> Herod.</P>
<P><HI>MOREOVER St.</HI> Matthew <HI>&s;ays, that</HI> when <HI>Herod</HI>
was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to <HI>Jo|&s;eph</HI>
in a dream in <HI>Egypt,</HI> &s;aying, Ari&s;e, take the young
child and his mother, and go into the land of <HI>I&s;rael: FOR
THEY ARE DEAD WHICH SOUGHT THE YOUNG CHILD'S
LIFE,</HI> ver: 19, 20.</P>
<P>IT being known from <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> that <HI>Antipater</HI> died
but five days before his father <HI>Herod;</HI> it may be infer|red
<PB N="451" REF="469">
from the u&s;e of the plural number, that <HI>Antipater</HI>
is meant by the angel as well as <HI>Herod,</HI> and that he
had been concerned in the de&s;ign to put Je&s;us to death,
and that his cruel intentions were one cau&s;e of <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI>'s
removal out of <HI>Judea</HI> into <HI>Egypt.</HI> But <HI>Antipater</HI> could
have no influence on his father's coun&s;els for ten months
or more before <HI>Herod</HI> died, as will appear pre&s;ently:
therefore the murder of the infants happened, mo&s;t
probably, a year before the death of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>IT may likewi&s;e be concluded from St. <HI>Matthew</HI>'s
account, that Je&s;us was born near two years before the
murder of the infants. For thus he &s;ays: <HI>Now when
Je&s;us was born in</HI> Bethlehem <HI>of</HI> Judea, <HI>in the days of</HI> He|rod
<HI>the king: Behold, there came wi&s;e men from the ea&s;t
to</HI> Jeru&s;alem, <HI>&s;aying, Where is he that is born king of the
Jews? for we have &s;een his &s;tar in the ea&s;t, and are
cone to wor&s;hip him,</HI> Matth. iii. 1, 2.&mdash;<HI>Then</HI> Herod,
<HI>when he had privily called the wi&s;e men, enquired of them
diligently what time the &s;tar appeared,</HI> v. 7.</P>
<P><HI>THE wi&s;e men having been to worship the child, and
departing into their own country without coming back.
to</HI> Jeru&s;alem, Then <HI>Herod</HI> when he &s;aw that he was mock|ed
of the wi&s;e men, was exceeding wroth, and &s;ent forth,
and &s;lew all the children that were in <HI>Bethlehem</HI> and in all
the coa&s;ts thereof, from two years old and under, according
to the time which he had diligently enquired of the wi&s;e men,
<HI>ver.</HI> 16.</P>
<P>JESUS was born before the wi&s;e men came, for their
que&s;tion was: <HI>Where is he that is born?</HI> They knew
he was born, becau&s;e they had &s;een his &s;tar in the ea&s;t.
<HI>Herod</HI> enquired what time the &s;tar appeared, and &s;lew
all the children from two years and under, according
to that time. Therefore the &s;tar had appeared two
years before, and Je&s;us was born at or near that time.</P>
<P>NOR can the &s;uppo&s;ed di&s;tance between the appear|ing
of the &s;tar and the arrival of the wi&s;e men weaken
this calculation. There might be many rea&s;ons to hin|der
their undertaking the journey immediately: Po&s;&s;i|bly,
they apprehended no nece&s;&s;ity of &s;etting out &s;oon|er
<PB N="452" REF="470">
For allowing the truth of the fact, that they
had &s;een a &s;tar by which they under&s;tood the birth of
a king in <HI>Judea,</HI> they could not well make any doubt
of his living, or of their having an opportunity to wor|&s;hip
him, though they delayed a year or two, But,
whatever were the rea&s;ons of their delay, we have no
right to depart from the words of St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> who
intimates very plainly, that it was <HI>two years</HI> from the
appearing of the Star to the time in which <HI>Herod</HI> or|dered
the children to be &s;lain.</P>
<P>ADD the&s;e two years to the forementioned year,
which <HI>Herod</HI> lived after the &s;laughter of the children;
and it will appear, that according to St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> Je&s;us
was born three years before <HI>Herod</HI>'s death.</P>
<P>2. IT may be proved from <HI>Tertullian,</HI> that Je&s;us was
born above two years before the death of <HI>Herod:</HI> for
he &s;ays, that the cen&s;us or tax made in <HI>Judea,</HI> at the time

to the cen&s;us or enrolment which St. <HI>Luke</HI> &s;peaks
of, then Je&s;us mu&s;t have been born about three years
before the death of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>POSSIBLY the objection may be &s;tated in this manner:
IT cannot be le&s;s than ten months from the com|mencement
of the enquiries made by <HI>Herod</HI> into the
cau&s;e of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s death and the crimes of <HI>Antipater</HI> to the
death of <HI>Herod.</HI> When the fir&s;t di&s;coveries were made,
<HI>Antipater</HI> was at <HI>Rome. Herod</HI> &s;ent for him in a very
pre&s;&s;ing but kind manner, di&s;&s;embling all &s;u&s;picions
concerning him, that he might not delay to return to
<HI>Judea. Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that when <HI>Antipater</HI> returned,
he knew nothing of the accu&s;ations which had been
brought again&s;t him, though<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. De Bell. lib. I. c. 31, p. 1034. v. 27.</NOTE> <HI>&s;even months</HI> had then
pa&s;&s;ed from the fir&s;t di&s;coverie of his crimes. In a day
or two after <HI>Antipater</HI>'s return to <HI>Judea Herod</HI> calls a
council, in which<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Ibid. cap. 32.</NOTE> he him&s;elf and <HI>Varus,</HI> Gover|nour
of <HI>Syria,</HI> pre&s;ided. <HI>Antipater</HI> is brought before
them, convicted and remanded to pri&s;on. But <HI>Herod</HI>
not daring to pronounce &s;entence on <HI>Antipater</HI> without
<PB N="454" REF="472">
leave from <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> Expre&s;&s;es were &s;ent to <HI>Rome</HI> with
an account of what had pa&s;&s;ed. After that the&s;e
me&s;&s;engers were &s;ent away from <HI>Judea,</HI> a letter was in|tercepted,
which was written to <HI>Antipater</HI> by <HI>Acme</HI> a
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> woman at <HI>Rome</HI> in the &s;ervice of the Empre&s;&s;e
<HI>Livia,</HI> in which letter were fre&s;h proofs of <HI>Antipater</HI>'s

to <HI>Rome.</HI> The&s;e return to <HI>Judea,</HI> and bring word,
that <HI>Acme</HI> had been put to death by <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> and that
the Emperour left it to <HI>Herod</HI> to do with <HI>Antipater</HI> as
he thought fit. Soon after this, <HI>Antipater</HI> was put to
death, and in five days after <HI>Herod</HI> died<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jo&s;. de Bell. I. i. c. 30, -33. Ant. l. xvii. c. 3,&mdash;8.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>As there was a &s;econd amba&s;&s;y &s;ent to <HI>Rome</HI> after the
trial of <HI>Antipater,</HI> and this returned before <HI>Herod</HI> died,
with an account that <HI>Acme</HI> had been put to death, upon
informations they had carried with them to <HI>Rome;</HI> it is
impo&s;&s;ible to a&s;&s;ign le&s;s than three months for the inter|val
between the arrival of <HI>Antipater</HI> in <HI>Judea,</HI> and <HI>Herod</HI>'s
death, which added to the former <HI>&s;even</HI> make <HI>ten</HI> months.</P>
<P>IT being &s;uppo&s;ed in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> chapter, that the exe|cution,
which <HI>Herod</HI> made in his own family, happened
at the &s;ame time with the &s;laughter of the children at
<HI>Bethlehem,</HI> it mu&s;t next be considered, how long time
that execution preceded the fir&s;t enquiries into <HI>Anti|pater</HI>'s
de&s;igns. The facts mentioned by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> in
this interval &s;tand thus.</P>
<P>HEROD having put to death &s;everal of his cour|tiers
and &s;ervants, calls his friends together, charges
<HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife with creating di&s;turbances, and in&s;i&s;ts
upon it that <HI>Pheroras</HI> put her away. <HI>Pheroras</HI> loving
his wife too well to comply with this demand, the two
brothers fall out. <HI>Pheroras</HI> leaves <HI>Herod</HI> and goes to
his Tetrarchy, withal &s;wearing &s;olemnly never to come
to <HI>Herod</HI> more. About this time, as it &s;eems, <HI>Antipa|ter</HI>
with his father's con&s;ent left <HI>Judea</HI> and went to <HI>Rome.</HI>
Soon after <HI>Pheroras</HI> was gone home, <HI>Herod</HI> fell &s;ick.
But though Herod &s;ent for <HI>Pheroras,</HI> he would not come
to him. Not long after, <HI>Pheroras</HI> is &s;ick; <HI>Herod</HI> goes
<PB N="455" REF="473">
to &s;ee him, they are reconciled, <HI>Pheroras</HI> dies. <HI>Herod</HI>
has him brought to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and buried there<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. de Bell. lib. i. cap. 29. &sect;. 4. Ant. xvii. cap. 3.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Pheroras</HI> was buried, &s;ome of his &s;ervants
made applications to <HI>Herod,</HI> de&s;iring him to enquire
into the manner and cau&s;es of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s death. The&s;e
enquiries open a horrid &s;cene of wickedne&s;&s;e. And it
appears, that a con&s;piracy had been formed by <HI>Anti|pater</HI>
to poi&s;on his father <HI>Herod;</HI> and that he had com|mitted
the execution of this de&s;ign to <HI>Pheroras,</HI> and
&s;ervants of his own, whom he had left behind him when
he went to <HI>Rome,</HI> and who were to obey <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s di|rections<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">De Bell. ibid. cap. 30. Ant. ibid. 4.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT will not be ea&s;ie to allot le&s;s than three months
for the facts ju&s;t now mentioned in the interval between
the execution in <HI>Herod</HI>'s family and the fir&s;t enquiries
into the cau&s;e of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s death. Three months ad|ded
to the former <HI>ten</HI> make <HI>thirteen.</HI></P>
<P>THE execution &s;poken of by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> and the &s;laugh|ter
of the children mentioned by St. <HI>Matthew</HI> being al|lowed
to have happened both at the &s;ame time, the
interval between the birth of Je&s;us and this exe|cution
is already computed. It cannot be le&s;s than
a year and nine or ten months, that is near two years;
con&s;eqnently, we have a fre&s;h argument that Je&s;us was
born <HI>three</HI> years before the death of <HI>Herod.</HI> But how
incon&s;i&s;tent this is with Je&s;us being <HI>about thirty years of
age</HI> in the <HI>fifteenth</HI> year of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> appears from what
has been &s;aid already.</P>
<P>HAVING now &s;tated the&s;e objections, and given
them their full force, as I imagine; before I proceed
to offer a reply, I would make two or three reflexions
upon &s;ome particulars contained in them.</P>
<P>I Do allow that it appears to me highly probable,
that <HI>Herod</HI> did live a year at left after the &s;laughter of
the infants.</P>
<P>BUT as for <HI>Tertullian</HI>'s te&s;timony, that the tax in
<HI>Judea</HI> was made by <HI>Saturninus,</HI> I think it is not of
<PB N="456" REF="474">
much weight; &s;ince he is the only per&s;on that has &s;aid
this, and he fiouri&s;hed not till about two hundred years
after the event. Be&s;ides, though <HI>Tertullian</HI> was well
skilled in the Roman Laws and Cu&s;toms, he has com|mitted
many gro&s;s blunders in hi&s;tory. The reader
may &s;ee &s;everal of them collected by<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Di&s;&s;ert. iii. &sect;. 13.</NOTE> Mr. <HI>Dodwell</HI>
in his Di&s;&s;ertations upon <HI>Ireneaus.</HI> One of them is the
computation <HI>Tertullian</HI> has made of the time from the
nativity of Je&s;us to the taking of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI><NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vid. Tertul. adver&s;. Jud. cap. 8.</NOTE> by
<HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian;</HI> which, according to him, was not full fifty
three years. And in reckoning up the &s;everal reigns of
the &s;everal Emperours he has quite omitted that of
<HI>Claudius,</HI> and allotted not quite ten years to the reign
of <HI>Nero.</HI> He, who could make &s;uch mi&s;takes in the
hi&s;tory of the Roman Emperours, might very ea&s;ily be
ignorant who was Pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria</HI> at the time of our
Saviour's Nativity.</P>
<P>NOR am I &s;atisfied with the proofs offered in the&s;e
objections, that Je&s;us was born two years before the
&s;laughter of the children at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Matth. ii. 16.</NOTE>
que&s;tions whether <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;hould not be
rendered from <HI>one year old</HI> and under, rather than from
<HI>two years old</HI> and under. But let <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;ignifie two
years, yet I think no conclu&s;ion can be made about
the preci&s;e time of the birth of Je&s;us from <HI>Herod</HI>'s or|ders.
It is mo&s;t likely, that this &s;tar appeared &s;ome
time before the birth of Je&s;us, and that it was under|&s;tood
by the Wi&s;e Men to pre&s;ignifie it. Hereby they
were prepared for their journey, and it is highly
probable that the&s;e Wi&s;e Men came into <HI>Judea</HI> to
wor&s;hip this King, as &s;oon as they could after
they concluded he was born, and that they arrived at
<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in a very few Months after his birth. But
&s;ince their enquiry was: <HI>Where is he that</HI> IS BORN <HI>King
of the Jews? Herod,</HI> who&s;e cruelty had in a manner no
bounds, orders all children near <HI>Bethlehem</HI> to be &s;lain
who had been born &s;ince the appearing of the Star, or
<PB N="457" REF="475">
perhaps even for &s;ome &s;pace<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Neque vero &s;equitur, &s;i Herodes, omni modo cavens ne puer elaberetur, lati&ugrave;s &s;aevitiam extendit, non minus in aetate quam loci ratione, ideo &s;tellam quoque tanto ante apparui&s;&s;e. Grot. ad Mat. ii. I.</NOTE> before the time, at
which, after an exact enquiry of the wi&s;e men, he per|ceived
it had appeared.</P>
<P>As there appears not any proof from St. <HI>Matthew,</HI>
that Je&s;us was born two years, or near two years be|fore
the &s;laughter of the infants; &s;o, I think al&s;o, that
there are no proofs in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> that the Oath taken by
the <HI>Jews</HI> had preceded two years, or near two years,
the execution made in <HI>Herod</HI>'s court. The Oath and
the Execution are related by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> both together.
The reader is referred to that pa&s;&s;age, as al&s;o to the
charge brought again&s;t <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife immediately af|ter
that execution was over. Among other things in
that charge <HI>Herod</HI> &s;ays,&mdash;That &s;he did all &s;he could,
to create a difference between him and his brother; that
the fine impo&s;ed upon the <HI>Phari&s;ees</HI> had been evaded by her
means; and that in the pre&s;ent affair nothing had been done
without her. <HI>This pre&s;ent affair</HI> I &s;uppo&s;e to relate to
the <HI>predictions given out by the</HI> Phari&s;ees, <HI>that God would
take away the kingdome from</HI> Herod <HI>and his children.</HI> The
payment of the fine is the la&s;t crime &s;he is charged with
before this affair, which had preceded the execution.
It certainly therefore is not a crime of two years &s;tand|ing.
<HI>Herod</HI> in &s;o long a time might have found out &s;ome
new fault in a woman, he was &s;o much offended with.
We may be pretty well a&s;&s;ured from this account, if I
mi&s;take not, that this Oath had preceded the &s;aid execu|tion
and predictions but &s;ome few months only.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING then the Execution to be truly dated,
in the objection, at about thirteen months before the
death of <HI>Herod,</HI> we may infer, that the <HI>Oath</HI> in <HI>Jo&s;e|phus,</HI>
and the <HI>De&s;cription</HI> in St. <HI>Luke</HI> was made, and that
Je&s;us was born about a year and fix or &s;even months
before <HI>Herod</HI>'s death.</P>
<P>IF indeed <HI>Antipater</HI> had been at <HI>Rome</HI> two years be|fore
he was recalled by his father, as &s;ome learned men
<PB N="458" REF="476">
have thought, then this execution mu&s;t have been made
above thirteen months before <HI>Herod</HI>'s death; becau&s;e it
is likely, or rather certain, that <HI>Antipater</HI> was in <HI>Judea</HI>
at the time of that execution. But I think it is a mi&s;|take,
to &s;uppo&s;e he had been &s;o long out of <HI>Judea. An|tipater</HI>
&s;tayed &s;ome time in <HI>Judea,</HI> after his brothers
<HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tobulus</HI> were<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Antiq. xvii. cap. I.</NOTE> dead; and took a
great deal of pains to defeat and &s;et a&s;ide the advanta|geous
marriages which <HI>Herod</HI> de&s;igned for their chil|dren:
He al&s;o entered into cabals with <HI>Pheroras</HI> and
his wife in order to &s;ecure the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion for him&s;elf,
Moreover, <HI>Saturninus</HI> was got to <HI>Rome</HI> a good while
before <HI>Antipater</HI> went from home. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays in his
<HI>Antiquities,</HI> that <HI>Antipater</HI> having re&s;olved, if po&s;&s;ible,
to ha&s;ten his father's death, and being de&s;irous to
&s;trengthen and &s;ecure his own intere&s;t, that he might
reign after him; &startq;He remitted large &s;ums of money
to his father's friends at <HI>Rome,</HI> that he might gain
their good will, but e&s;pecially that he might have
the favour of <HI>Saturninus</HI> the governour of <HI>Syria</HI><NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. ibid. p. 750. v. 10.</NOTE>&endq;
<HI>Saturninus</HI> is not here called governour of <HI>Syria,</HI> becau&s;e
he was then actually in that Po&s;t, for he is manifestly at
<HI>Rome;</HI> but to di&s;tingui&s;h him from others of that
name, of which there were many. And it appears
from the parallel place in the <HI>War of the Jews,</HI> that one
favour which <HI>Antipater</HI> de&s;ired of the&s;e per&s;ons at <HI>Rome,</HI>
who had influence on his father, was, that they would
write to <HI>Herod</HI> that his [<HI>Antipater</HI>'s] pre&s;ence at <HI>Rome</HI>
would be &s;erviceable to him in the pre&s;ent po&s;ture of
affairs. <HI>Antipater</HI> had now &s;ettled all things with <HI>Phe|roras</HI>
for the poy&s;oning of <HI>Herod,</HI> as &s;oon as an oppor|tunity
offered. But <HI>Antipater,</HI> &s;o long as he &s;taid in
<HI>Judea,</HI> could not forbear conver&s;ing with <HI>Pheroras</HI> and
his wife, which was extremely di&s;agreeable to <HI>Herod,</HI>
<PB N="459" REF="477">
&startq;Therefore <HI>Antipater</HI><NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">de B. l. I. c. 29. &sect;. 2.</NOTE> contrived by the intere&s;t of
friends at <HI>Rome,</HI> to procure leave for a voyage thi|ther.
The&s;e writing, that it would be very proper
for <HI>Antipater</HI> to be &s;ent to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> without delay; he
[<HI>Herod</HI>] immediately &s;ent him thither, having fur|ni&s;hed
him with a &s;umptuous equipage and large
&s;ums of money, giving him al&s;o his Will to carry
with him to the Emperour.&endq;</P>
<P>IT is true, that after <HI>Antipater</HI>'s journey to <HI>Rome,</HI>
mention is made of <HI>Saturninus</HI> as in <HI>Syria:</HI> But then it
is, becau&s;e <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> relates a fact, that had happened
before <HI>Antipater</HI> went from <HI>Judea. Jo&s;ephus,</HI> giving
an account of what <HI>Antipater</HI> did at <HI>Rome,</HI> mentions<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">De B. ibid. &sect;. 3. Ant. 17. c. 3. &sect;. 2.</NOTE>
&s;ome accomplices of <HI>Syllaeus</HI> &s;ent thither by <HI>Saturninus</HI>
to an&s;wer for them&s;elves. But this might have been
done by <HI>Saturninus</HI> &s;ome time before.</P>
<P>AGAIN, if <HI>Antipater</HI> had been two years out of <HI>Ju|dea,
Herod,</HI> who wanted plau&s;ible rea&s;ons to induce
him to return, could not have failed to have put this,
of his long ab&s;ence, into his letters, as a very cogent
and unexceptionable argument, which yet he does not
appear<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">See the &s;ub&s;tance of the&s;e letters, De B. l. I. c. 31. &sect;. 3. Ant. 17. c. 5. &sect;. I.</NOTE> to have
done.</P>
<P>IT maybe farther argued, that <HI>Antipater</HI>'s journey
to <HI>Rome</HI> did not precede the death of <HI>Herod</HI> two years.
The very commencement of the enquiries into the death
of <HI>Pheroras</HI> could not be above ten months before the
death of <HI>Herod,</HI> as has been &s;hewn already. A great
progre&s;&s;e had been made in tho&s;e examinations; <HI>Doris,
Antipater</HI>'s mother, had been detected and put out
of<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ant. 17. c. 4. &sect;. 2.</NOTE> <HI>Herod</HI>'s hou&s;e; <HI>Mariamne</HI> the High Prie&s;t's
daughter<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Ibid.</NOTE> was al&s;o put away, and her &s;on &s;truck
out of a new Will <HI>Herod</HI> had made. &startq;When the&s;e
<PB N="460" REF="478">
things were doing, &s;ays <HI>Jo&s;ephus, Bathyllus Antipater</HI>'s
freedman arrived from <HI>Rome.</HI> And being put to the
que&s;tion was di&s;covered to have brought with him a
fre&s;h quantity of poy&s;on to be given to his [<HI>Antipa|ter</HI>'s]
mother and <HI>Pheroras,</HI> that if the former had
failed to di&s;patch the King, they might try this<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. ibid. &sect;. 3. de B. I. c. 31. &sect;. I.</NOTE>
upon him.&endq; Before <HI>Antipater</HI> had gone to <HI>Rome,</HI> he
had provided<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Antiq. ib. &sect;. 3. De Bell. ibid. c. 30. &sect;. 5.</NOTE> poy&s;on for <HI>Pheroras</HI> to give his fa|ther.
It is plain, that when <HI>Bathyllus</HI> was &s;ent from
<HI>Rome, Antipater</HI> did not know whether <HI>Pheroras</HI> had
made any u&s;e of the fir&s;t poy&s;on or not, and that he had
&s;till a full confidence in him. But if <HI>Antipater</HI> had been
gone from <HI>Judea</HI> two years, and had heard nothing of
the effect of that poy&s;on, &s;uch a delay would have crea|ted
&s;u&s;picions. Moreover this &s;econd preparation ap|pears
to be &s;ent to back the former; &s;o that we may
be a&s;&s;ured, we are to go backward, not years, but on|ly
&s;ome months for the true time of <HI>Antipater</HI>'s leaving
<HI>Judea.</HI></P>
<P>ONCE more, the fir&s;t opening of the enquiries into
the cau&s;es of <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s death has been laid at about ten
months before the death of <HI>Herod.</HI> That <HI>Antipater</HI> was
then but newly &s;et out for <HI>Rome,</HI> may be inferred from
hence. <HI>Pheroras</HI> being dead, <HI>Herod</HI> had him brought
to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> honoured him with a funeral, and made
great lamentations for him. &startq;This, &s;ays <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> was
the beginning of &s;orrow to <HI>Antipater,</HI> though<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 17. c. 3. &sect;. 3.</NOTE> he
was then failed to <HI>Rome;</HI> God requiring of him the
blood of his brothers. I &s;hall give a particular rela|tion
of this whole affair, that it may be an admoni|tion
to all mankind to adhere to the practi&s;e of vir|tue.&endq;
If <HI>Antipater</HI> had been then any long time out
<PB N="461" REF="479">
of <HI>Judea, Jo&s;ephus</HI> would have &s;aid, though he was
then at <HI>Rome,</HI> or though he <HI>had been &s;ome time there.</HI>
It is po&s;&s;ible, <HI>Antipater</HI> might have been gone from
home a month or two; but the phra&s;e here u&s;ed by <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
&s;eems to me to import, that there were not yet
come to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> any tidings of <HI>Antipater</HI>'s arrival at
<HI>Rome.</HI></P>
<P>I HOPE it will be excu&s;ed, that I have in&s;i&s;ted &s;o long
upon this point. The &s;uppo&s;ition, that <HI>Antipater</HI> was
gone to <HI>Rome</HI> before the removal of <HI>Saturninus,</HI> and
two years or more before the death of <HI>Herod,</HI> has cau&s;ed
much confu&s;ion in the chronology of many learned men
about this time.</P>
<P>THERE is in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> another pa&s;&s;age, not yet ob|&s;erved
by any one upon this occa&s;ion, that I know of,
which may help to determine the time of the execution
made by <HI>Herod</HI> in his court and at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and which
will confirm my opinion about it. <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> having
given the hi&s;tory of <HI>Herod</HI>'s putting to death his two
&s;ons <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tobulus,</HI> makes divers reflections
upon that action. &startq;It might have been &s;ufficient, <HI>&s;ays
he,</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 16. c. ult. ad fin.</NOTE> even &s;uppo&s;ing them guilty of the crimes laid to
their charge, to have condemned them to perpetual
impri&s;onment, or to have bani&s;hed them, but to take
away their lives was a piece of downright cruelty.
Nor does the delay extenuate the crime; for after de|liberation,
having been re&s;olved at one time and in
&s;u&s;pen&s;e at another, to commit &s;uch a fact, is an argu|ment
of a cruel di&s;po&s;ition, and of a mind ob&s;tinately
bent upon wickedne&s;&s;e: Which &s;ame temper he &s;hew|ed
afterwards upon another occa&s;ion, when he &s;pared
not others, [or <HI>the re&s;t</HI>] per&s;ons who &s;eemed to be the
mo&s;t dear to him of any. The ju&s;tice of their puni&s;h|ment
<PB N="462" REF="480">
abates our compa&s;&s;ion for their ruine, but yet
his crueltie was alike here al&s;o, in that he &s;pared not
even them. But of the&s;e more in cour&s;e by and by.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t piece of cruelty I take to mean the exe|cution
made by <HI>Herod</HI> in his court, and which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
relates afterwards in the next book of the&s;e <HI>Antiquities,</HI>
It cannot refer to the death of <HI>Antipater,</HI> becau&s;e he is
but one; nor to the de&s;ign upon the <HI>chief men of Judea</HI>
&s;hut up in the <HI>Circus,</HI> becau&s;e they had committed no
offen&s;e, and that de&s;ign was never executed; nor to the
<HI>Rabbies,</HI> becau&s;e they do not appear to have ever been
dear to <HI>Herod.</HI> But it mu&s;t be the before mention|ed
<HI>execution,</HI> of which I hope the reader has a clear idea.
Then <HI>Herod</HI> put to death all of his own family, that
adhered to the things &s;aid by the <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and other
per&s;ons who appear to have been favourites with him.
And it is ob&s;ervable, that as in that account <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
is plea&s;ed to divert him&s;elf with tho&s;e executions; &s;o,
here al&s;o, even when he is aggravating the cruelty
of <HI>Herod,</HI> he betrays the &s;ame good will toward tho&s;e
who then &s;uffered under the rage of this inhumane
tyrant.</P>
<P>IT would be de&s;irable here to &s;ettle exactly the time
when the&s;e two &s;ons of <HI>Herod</HI> were put to death. Dr.

they were tryed, and by which they were condemned,
in the month of <HI>May,</HI> A. U. 749, about ten months
before <HI>Herod</HI> died. But if <HI>Herod</HI> died in the Spring,
A. U. 750, as the Doctor &s;uppo&s;es, this council is cer|tainly
placed by him too late. It is evident from parti|culars
in&s;i&s;ted on in the objection, and &s;ince allowed or
mentioned by me, that it mu&s;t have preceded the death
of <HI>Herod</HI> above ten months. Moreover, <HI>Saturninus</HI> was
one of this council, and if the fir&s;t Medal and the epo|cha
above mentioned be allowed, <HI>Saturninus</HI> was gone
from <HI>Syria</HI> before <HI>Sept.</HI> 748. It may be however &s;up|po&s;ed,
I think, that this Council was not held long be|fore

&s;uppo&s;e, but mu&s;t have happened a con&s;iderable
time before the removal of <HI>Saturninus;</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI>
appears to have been reconciled to <HI>Herod</HI> before
<HI>Saturninus</HI> left the province, and before the council at
<HI>Berytum,</HI> in which <HI>Alexander</HI> and <HI>Ari&s;tobulus</HI> were con|demned:
I an&s;wer, that the enrolment is not placed by
me too late at all. It might be re&s;olved upon by <HI>Au|gu&s;tus</HI>
before, and yet not be executed till after <HI>Satur|ninus</HI>
went away. And though <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> might be in
&s;ome mea&s;ure pacified, yet he might think fit to have
the a&s;&s;&s;&s;ement made. Be&s;ides, though <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays,
that upon the applications <HI>Nicolas</HI> of <HI>Dama&s;cus</HI> had
made to <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> at <HI>Rome,</HI> the Emperour was recon|ciled
to <HI>Herod,</HI> that <HI>Syllaeus</HI> was ordered home, requir|ed
to pay the money he owed, and give all proper &s;a|tisfaction,
and was afterwards<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 16. c. 10. &sect;. 9.</NOTE> to be puni&s;hed: Yet
it is certain, that <HI>Syllaeus</HI> did not give <HI>Herod</HI> or any one
el&s;e &s;atisfaction. And it may be from thence infer|red,
that <HI>Herod</HI> was not fully rein&s;tated in <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s
favour, for then <HI>Syllaeus</HI> would have been more &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive.

time, not having performed any of tho&s;e things which
<HI>Ce&s;ar</HI> enjoyned. And <HI>Antipater</HI> accu&s;ed him to <HI>Ce&s;ar</HI>
<PB N="464" REF="482">
upon the &s;ame heads he had been before accu&s;ed of by
<HI>Nicolas.</HI>&endq; From what has been &s;aid concerning the
time of <HI>Antipater</HI>'s journey it appears, that this accu&s;a|tion
mu&s;t have been brought again&s;t <HI>Syllaeus</HI> in the la&s;t
year of <HI>Herod</HI>'s life.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that <HI>Herod</HI>'s affairs were not in a good
po&s;ture at this time at <HI>Rome.</HI> If they had, <HI>Antipater</HI>
could not have made the &s;tate of them, and the &s;ervice
he might do his father there, a preten&s;e for his journey.
Moreover, <HI>Antipater</HI><NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. De B. 1. c. 31. &sect;. 2.</NOTE> charged <HI>Herod</HI> with a &s;um of
two hundred talents, laid out chiefly, as he pretended,
in the cau&s;e again&s;t <HI>Syllaeus,</HI> his father's great enemy.
From all which it is rea&s;onable to conclude, that <HI>Nico|las</HI>
had, in his hi&s;tory, out of regard to his ma&s;ter and
him&s;elf, magnified the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of his negociations at
<HI>Rome.</HI> Nor can it be ju&s;tly expected from an Hi&s;torian,
that when he comes down to the affairs of his own time,
he &s;hould be perfectly indifferent toward tho&s;e in which
he acted a part him&s;elf.</P>
<P>HAVING now cleared the way, I would lay down
two or three conclu&s;ions.</P>
<P>1. I APPREHEND it appears from what has been
here offered, that there is no nece&s;&s;ity of placing the
birth of Je&s;us above a year and &s;ix months before the
death of <HI>Herod.</HI> If <HI>Herod</HI> died in <HI>March,</HI> A. U. 750,
I &s;hould be inclined to place the nativity of Je&s;us in
<HI>September</HI> or <HI>October</HI> A. U. 748. If <HI>Herod</HI> died in <HI>March</HI>
751, then the nativity of Je&s;us might very well be
placed in <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October</HI> 749. As I am not able
fully to determine the time of <HI>Herod</HI>'s death; I &s;hall for
the future have &s;ome regard to both the&s;e dates of our
Saviour's Nativity.</P>
<P>2. THE acount that has been given above of the
time of <HI>Saturninus</HI>'s removal, and <HI>Varus</HI>'s arrival in the
province of <HI>Syria</HI> does al&s;o incline us to one of the&s;e
dates. It is not improbable, that the oath was taken,
or the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment made much about the &s;ame time that
<PB N="465" REF="483">
<HI>Varus</HI> came into <HI>Syria.</HI> And it is &s;uppo&s;ed by many
learned men, that the Roman Governours u&s;ually came
from <HI>Rome</HI> into the&s;e Ea&s;tern provinces at the latter
end of the &s;ummer. It is certain, that upon the re|moval
of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> when <HI>Cyrenius</HI> came Governour
into <HI>Syria,</HI> there was an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment made in <HI>Syria</HI> and
<HI>Judea.</HI> I am the rather inclined to think this the time
of the Oath, becau&s;e <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> in his hi&s;tory does not re|late
when it was taken, but mentions it only Upon oc|ca&s;ion
of a di&s;turbance at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> which had a con|nexion
with it. And it is ob&s;ervable, that he has &s;aid
nothing of <HI>Varus,</HI> nor of the concerns of <HI>Syria,</HI> till we
hear of <HI>Varus</HI> being at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> when <HI>Antipater</HI> return|ed
home. But, if tho&s;e Medals are to be relied on,
<HI>Varus</HI> had now been a good while in <HI>Syria.</HI> There is
therefore in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> a long gap in the concerns of <HI>Syria,</HI>
and al&s;o in the publick concerns of <HI>Judea</HI> from the
conncil at <HI>Berytum</HI> to the execution at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> Du|ring
this time of <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s &s;ilence, I &s;uppo&s;e the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;e|ment
was made. According to the fir&s;t of the <HI>Antio|chian</HI>
Medals, <HI>Varus</HI> came into <HI>Syria</HI> before <HI>Sept.</HI> 748.
If this be &s;uppo&s;ed the mo&s;t likely date of his govern|ment,
and if it be al&s;o mo&s;t probable that <HI>Herod</HI> died
A. U. 750, the&s;e may &s;trongly di&s;po&s;e us to place the
nativity of Je&s;us in <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October</HI> 748.</P>
<P>3. THE latter part of the &s;ummer, or the autumn
&s;ea&s;on &s;eems to be the mo&s;t likely time of the year
for the birth of <HI>Je&s;us.</HI> There is no particular rea&s;on to
determine us to the 25th of <HI>December.</HI> The very depth
of winter is not a very proper &s;ea&s;on for a &s;urvey and
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, when people are to enter them&s;elves ac|cording
to their tribes or families. The autumn, when
harve&s;t and vintage are over, is a time of general lei|&s;ure.
When Je&s;us was born at <HI>Bethlehem, There were
in the &s;ame country &s;hepherds abiding in the field, keeping
watch over their flocks by night,</HI> Luke ii. 8. In &s;ome
very mild climates &s;heep may be abroad in the night
time in <HI>December.</HI> But it is not very likely, they
&s;houid be &s;o in tho&s;e countries, where they mu&s;t be
<PB N="466" REF="484">
attended with &s;hepherds. This circum&s;tance is not very
favourable to the &s;uppo&s;ition, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> was born the
25th <HI>Dec.</HI> and we are at liberty to place it in autumn,
a more likely &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>IT is not improbable then, that <HI>Je&s;us</HI> might be born
&s;ome time between the middle of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> and the middle
of <HI>November. Cyrenius,</HI> we may &s;uppo&s;e, came into
<HI>Judea</HI> at the time, or &s;oon after the time that <HI>Varus</HI>
came Governour into <HI>Syria,</HI> and publi&s;hed the decree
of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> requiring all people to enter them&s;elves,
their dependents, and e&s;tates. <HI>Judea</HI> was a country of
a narrow compare, and the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement might very well
be made in two or three months. <HI>Cyrenius</HI> coming into
the country, and being a man of di&s;patch in all his un|dertakings;
being de&s;irous al&s;o to ha&s;ten to <HI>Rome</HI> to re|ceive
the honours decreed him for the victory over the
<HI>Homonaden&s;es;</HI> being al&s;o concerned to &s;et &s;ail before the
bad weather came on, he appointed all people to en|role
them&s;elves with all expedition within a certain li|mited
time, which they did accordingly. <HI>And all went
to be taxed every one in his own city,</HI> ver. 3. The &s;hort
time appointed for this work may be fairly concluded
from St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s hi&s;tory of it. If the &s;pace of time al|lotted
for it had been of any considerable length, it can|not
be thought but that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> would have taken an
opportunity to go to <HI>Bethlehem</HI> &s;ome while before the
time of the Virgin's delivery, or el&s;e have deferred the
journey till that was over. There is not the left hint,
that this journey was taken ju&s;t at this &s;ea&s;on in obe|dience
to a divine admonition. It is given us as the
pure re&s;ult of obedience to this decree of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI></P>
<P>WE will now lay together a few events of this time,
in the order in which it may be &s;uppo&s;ed they happened.</P>
<P>ABOUT a year and &s;ix or &s;even months before the
death of <HI>Herod,</HI> &s;oon after the arrival of <HI>Varus</HI> in the
province of <HI>Syria,</HI> in <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> or <HI>September,</HI> A. U. 748,
or 749, <HI>Julian</HI> year 40, or 41, <HI>Cyrenius</HI> [or &s;ome other
per&s;on of eminence] came into <HI>Judea,</HI> an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement
was made there, and in the time of it, Je&s;us was born
<PB N="467" REF="485">
at <HI>Bethlehem</HI> in the month of <HI>September</HI> or <HI>October.</HI> After
the term of forty days was expired Je&s;us was pre&s;ented
in the temple at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and <HI>Mary</HI> made her offer|ing
according to the Law. When the&s;e things were
fini&s;hed, they went from <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> and dwelt in &s;ome
City of <HI>Judea,</HI> po&s;&s;ibly at <HI>Bethlehem.</HI> In the year fol|lowing,
<HI>viz.</HI> A. U. 749, or 750, about the beginning
of <HI>February, came wi&s;e men from the ea&s;t to</HI> Jeru&s;alem,
<HI>&s;aying, Where is he that is born king of the</HI> Jews? They
being guided by the &s;tar which they <HI>had &s;een in the ea&s;t,
went and wor&s;hipped him.</HI> After their departure, the
Virgin and the child Je&s;us being now fit for travelling,
<HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> was admoni&s;hed by <HI>an angel, to take the young
child and his mother and flee into</HI> Egypt, which he did.
<HI>Herod</HI> &s;oon perceiving from the wi&s;e men's not return|ing
to him, that he had been <HI>mocked</HI> by them, and be|ing
much enraged thereat, <HI>&s;ent forth and &s;lew all the chil|dren
that were in</HI> Bethlehem, <HI>and in all the coa&s;ts thereof,
from two years old and under, according to the time which
he bad diligently enquired of the wi&s;e men.</HI> He al&s;o put to
death at the &s;ame time divers <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> and other per|&s;ons
at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> &s;ome of his own family and attendants;
who, being before in expectation of the coming of a
great Prince who was to ri&s;e up from among them, and
by the arrival of the wi&s;e men had been confirmed in the
belief that this event was now at hand, expre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves
in terms, which <HI>Herod</HI> and his &s;on <HI>Antipater</HI> and
their flatterers termed &s;editious. Immediately after the&s;e
executions <HI>Pheroras</HI>'s wife was called to an account al&s;o,
as being &s;uppo&s;ed to have entertained the &s;ame princi|ples
with the&s;e <HI>Phari&s;ees,</HI> to whom &s;he had lately &s;hewn
great favour in paying the fine impo&s;ed upon them for
not entering them&s;elves and taking the appointed Oath
in the time, of the forementioned a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement. <HI>Pherora$</HI>
not &s;ubmitting to the orders given him by <HI>Herod</HI> in coun|cil
to put away his wife, <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Pheroras</HI> fell out.
Hereupon, in the latter end of <HI>February,</HI> or beginning
of <HI>March,</HI> the &s;ame year, <HI>Pheroras</HI> retires with his wif$

of <HI>May</HI> following, <HI>Pheroras</HI> dies, is brought to <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI>
and buried. No &s;ooner was the mourning for him
over, but his &s;ervants apply to <HI>Herod</HI> to make enquiry
into the cau&s;es of his death: and now in the middle of
<HI>May,</HI> or &s;oon after, the examinations into this matter
began; and though <HI>Antipater</HI> was failed from <HI>Judea</HI> for
<HI>Rome,</HI> and got at a di&s;tance from the place in which <HI>ju|&s;tice</HI>
ought to be executed on him; and therefore, ac|cording
to the ordinary cour&s;e of things, it might have
been &s;uppo&s;ed he was in &s;afety: yet from this $im$ the
Divine vengeance began to prepare it&s;elf again&s;t him,
till at la&s;t it fell upon him for all his horrid crimes. The
evidence was at fir&s;t ob&s;cure and imperfect, but opened
continually more and more. <HI>Herod</HI> in his letters to <HI>An|tipater</HI>
di&s;&s;embled his re&s;entments, but earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed
his return to <HI>Judea.</HI> About the middle of <HI>December,</HI>
&s;even months after the fir&s;t enquiry into the cau&s;e of
of <HI>Pherras</HI>'s death, <HI>Antipater</HI> arrived at <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI>
And is tried before <HI>Herod,</HI> and <HI>Varus</HI> pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria,</HI>

was executed, and in five days after <HI>Herod</HI> him|&s;elf
died, about a year and five or &s;ix months after the
birth of Je&s;us.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I pre&s;ume it appears, we lie under
no nece&s;&s;ity of dating the birth of Je&s;us before the latter
end of the year of <HI>Rome</HI> 748, or 749. We hereby
in part abate the objection, as &s;tated above; but &s;till we

<P>&sect;. II. 1. WHEN St <HI>Luke</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Now in the fifteenth
year of the reign of</HI> Tiberius,&mdash;<HI>the word of God came
unto</HI> John, he may intend &s;ome computation of the
reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> different from that of his &s;ole empire
after the death of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> It is no unu&s;ual thing for
the reigns of princes to be computed from &s;everal dates.
There were two computations of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s
reign. For, as Dr. <HI>Prideaux</HI> ob&s;erves, &startq;<HI>Nabopolla&s;ar</HI>
King of <HI>Babylon</HI> being old and infirm took his &s;on
<HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI> into partner&s;hip in the Empire, and
&s;ent him with an army into tho&s;e parts [<HI>Syria</HI> and
<HI>Pale&s;tine</HI>]. And from hence the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> computation
of the years of <HI>Nebuchadnezzar</HI>'s reign begins.&mdash;But
according to the <HI>Babylonians</HI> his reign is not reckoned
to begin till after his father's death, which happened
two years afterwards. And both computations being
found in &s;cripture, it is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay &s;o much here
for the reconciling of them<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Conn. Part. 1. p. 60.</NOTE>.&endq; And there were two
or three ways of computing the reign of<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><HI>Mar&s;hall</HI>'s Treati&s;e of the 70 weeks, p. 44.</NOTE> <HI>Cyrus.</HI></P>
<P>BUT to come nearer to our time; there were many
computations of the reign of<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Vid. Petav. Rationarium Temp. Par. 2. l. 3. c. 15. Pagi Appar. n. 66.&mdash;73, 103, 114.</NOTE> <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> Some com|puted

<P>IT may be worth while to ob&s;erve with <HI>Pagi,</HI> that
the&s;e two writers who tell us the &s;tory of this drunken
bout of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and the con&s;equences of it, &s;eem not
to have had their accounts from one and the &s;ame &s;ource.
They differ from each other in two or three particulars:
One &s;ays, that this piece of exce&s;&s;e la&s;ted <HI>two days and
two nights;</HI> the other, <HI>one night and two days. Plinie</HI>
mentions only the preferment of <HI>Pi&s;o, Suetonius</HI> adds that
of <HI>Flaccus</HI> al&s;o. But they both agree in &s;aying, that
<HI>Tiberius</HI> was <HI>then Prince,</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> adds a very par|ticular
circum&s;tance as to the time, that it was during
the correction of the publick manners, which may very
naturally lead us to what he had &s;aid of the Law pa&s;&s;ed,
that <HI>Tiberius</HI> &s;hould govern the provinces jointly with
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> and make the Cen&s;us with him; one part of
which at <HI>Rome</HI> was the Correction of manners.</P>
<P>BUT we mu&s;t enquire &s;omewhat more particularly
into the time of this act of intemperance. It may be
ea&s;ily inferred from <HI>Tacitus:</HI> who relating the affairs of
the year in which <HI>Domitius Aenobarbus</HI> and <HI>M. Furius
Camillus</HI> were Con&s;uls, &s;c. A. U. 785, A. D. 32, &s;ays:

back twenty years, we are brought to the 12th year of
the Chri&s;tian Aera, and the 765th of the City; in which
year, according to <HI>Tacitus, Pi&s;o</HI> mu&s;t have been prefect
of <HI>Rome,</HI> which is two years before the death of <HI>Au|gu&s;tus.</HI></P>

<P>ANOTHER objection again&s;t <HI>Pi&s;o</HI>'s being made pre|fect

<P>BUT that this <HI>correction of manners,</HI> which <HI>Suetonius</HI>

two or three pa&s;&s;ages, not particularly in&s;i&s;ted on by

title of Emperour given him by a decree, before <HI>Augu|&s;tus</HI>
died, as has been ob&s;erved already. Moreover
this title of Emperour is frequently given by <HI>Roman</HI> and
<HI>Greek</HI> authors to <HI>Titus</HI> and <HI>Trajan</HI> on account of their
tribunician and procon&s;ular power, which they enjoyed,
the former in the life-time of his father <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> the
latter, of <HI>Nerva.</HI> Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI> thinks, this title of Empe|rour
which was given to the&s;e Collegues in the Empire
was founded particularly on the perpetual procon&s;ular
power in all the provinces<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Mitus enim, quemadmodum &amp; ante eum Tiberius, ac po&s;t eum Trajanus, imperii Collega fuit, ideoque imperatoris titulo exornatus.

<P>(5.) THERE were two different computations of
<HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign in the time of St. <HI>Clement</HI> of <HI>Alexandria.</HI>
For having fir&s;t &s;aid, that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> reigned forty three
years and <HI>Tiberius</HI> twenty-two,<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Clem. Strom. l. 1. p. 339. A. Pari&s;is 1629.</NOTE>, he adds: &startq;But &s;ome

<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> reigned forty &s;ix years four months and one
day. Then <HI>Tiberius,</HI> twenty &s;ix years, &s;ix months,
nineteen days.<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> id. ib. C.</NOTE>&endq;.</P>
<P>HAVING laid before the reader the chief arguments
that have been produced for the Procon&s;ular or joint
Empire of <HI>Tiberius</HI> with <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> I will con&s;ider al&s;o
&s;ome of the objections there are again&s;t this opinion.</P>
<P>1. IT is objected, That <HI>Spartian</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Marcus
Aurelius</HI> and <HI>Lucius Verus</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Hi &s;unt, qui po&s;tea duo pariter Augu&s;ti, primi rempulicam gu|bernaverunt. Spartian. in Hadrian. cap. 24. Vid. Eutrop. lib. viii. $. 9. &amp; Capitolin. in Marc. c. 7.</NOTE> were the two fir&s;t <HI>Augu|&s;ti</HI>
that governed the <HI>Roman Empire</HI> together. But to
this it is an&s;wered, that none of the Patrons of this opini|on
ever &s;aid, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> had the title of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> whil&s;t
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> lived, but only that he was Collegue with
him in the Empire. The&s;e words of <HI>Spartian</HI> are no
more an objection again&s;t <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Procon&s;ular em|pire,
than they are again&s;t <HI>Titus</HI>'s and <HI>Trajan</HI>'s, who
certainly enjoyed this honour, the one with his father
<HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> and the other with <HI>Nerva.</HI></P>
<P>NOR indeed did the title of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> give any new
power. It was only a title of honour<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vid. Dio. lib. liii. p. 507.</NOTE>, which &s;ort of
<PB N="481" REF="499">
titles were u&s;ually taken gradually. <HI>Tiberius</HI> ever re|fu&s;ed
that of Father of his country. And would not
permit that of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> to be given him by any Decree,
though he accepted of it from &s;ome per&s;ons, and made
u&s;e of it him&s;elf in letters to<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Dio. lib. 57. p. 607. A.</NOTE> foreign Princes. And
<HI>Dio</HI> takes notice of it as a &s;ingularity in <HI>Caligula,</HI> that
in one day he accepted all tho&s;e titles, which <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>
had received throughout his long reign, and had &s;uf|fered
to be given him only one by one (&s;ome of which
<HI>Tiberius</HI> never would accept of) except only that of fa|ther
of his country; which he took upon him al&s;o in a
&s;hort time after<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Dio. lib. 59. p. 641. D.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>2dly, IT is objected: If <HI>Tiberius</HI> had been made Col|legue
in the empire with <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> there could have
been no rea&s;on for tho&s;e fears about the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Tiberius,</HI> which <HI>Livia</HI> &s;hewed upon the death<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Acribus namque cu&s;todiis domum, &amp; vias &s;ep&s;erat Livia. Tacit. Ann. lib. 1. cap. 5.</NOTE> of <HI>Au|gu&s;tus.</HI>
Nor would <HI>Tiberius</HI> have he&s;itated to accept the
empire when offered to him by the Senate. Or indeed,
what occa&s;ion could there have been for any new inve|&s;titure
at all?</P>
<P>BUT to this, I think it is ea&s;y to an&s;wer; that it is
no &s;urpri&s;ing thing, that <HI>Livia</HI> &s;hould be under &s;ome
pain, when the &s;ettlement of her &s;on in the empire was
at &s;take. Though <HI>Tiberius</HI> had been partner in the em|pire,
yet certainly the death of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> made a great
change. <HI>Germanicus</HI> was very popular, and at the head
of a numerous army<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Tacit. Ann. lib. i. cap. 33 /M; 35. Dio. lib. 37, p. 603.</NOTE> And as for <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s he&s;i|tation,
he had been hitherto but partner in the empire,
and &s;ome kind of new inve&s;titure was needful. It is true,
he carried his di&s;&s;imulation very far: but <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> him|&s;elf
<PB N="482" REF="500">
never renewed a fre&s;h term of government (which
he did &s;everal times) but with much difficulty; and not
till he had been overcome by importunity and the con|&s;ideration
of the nece&s;&s;ity of affairs.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, this di&s;&s;imulation of <HI>Tiberius</HI> has afford|ed
a new proof, that he had been Collegue with <HI>Augu|&s;tus.</HI>
For, as <HI>Tacitus</HI> and <HI>Dio</HI> intimate very plainly the
fears which <HI>Tiberius</HI> had of <HI>Germanicus;</HI> &s;o <HI>Suetonius</HI> in
particular &s;ays, &startq;He pretended a bad &s;tate of health,
that <HI>Germanicus</HI> might entertain hopes of a &s;peedy
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion, or at le&s;t<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Simulavit &amp; valitudinem, quo aequiore animo Germanicus cele|rem &s;ucce&s;&s;ionem vel cert&egrave; &s;ocietatem principatus operiretur. Suet. in Tiber. Cap. 25.</NOTE> a partnership in the empire.&endq;
But &s;uch an expectation had been ridiculous in <HI>Germa|nicus,</HI>
and this preten&s;e of <HI>Tiberius</HI> could never have had
the effect he de&s;igned, if no one had been partner in the
empire before.</P>
<P>3. BUT the chief objection again&s;t the &s;uppo&s;ition,
that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has computed the reign of <HI>Tiberius</HI> from
the time of his Procon&s;ular empire &s;eems to be this;
That it does not appear that any writers have computed
the reign of tho&s;e who were Collegues in the empire by
the epocha of their Procon&s;ular empire, and that in
particular there are no traces of this computation of
<HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">E&s;t autem inauditum in omni memoria, <HI>Titi</HI> annos abalio initio fui&s;&s;e deductos quam a morte Ve&s;pa&s;iani. S. Ba&s;nage Annal. Pol. Eccle&s;. A. D. 11. n. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>To this I an&s;wer: There is rea&s;on to think, that
people did often compute according to the epocha of
the Procon&s;ular empire. <HI>Pagi</HI> mentions a Medal, which
has this in&s;cription: <HI>In the</HI> xi. <HI>new &s;acred year of the

<PB N="483" REF="501">
<HI>Titus</HI> reigned alone after his father's death but a little
above two years.</P>
<P>IT will not be expected, I &s;hould here attempt to ex|plain
the meaning of the epocha of the <HI>new &s;acred year.</HI>
All that I &s;hall ob&s;erve, is, that it appears not to have
been u&s;ed upon the coins of any Emperours be&s;ide tho&s;e
of <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian, Titus, Domitian</HI> and <HI>Nerva:</HI> And that it
does not begin at any one common period, &s;uch as the
building or dedication of any one particular Temple,
but that the numbers an&s;wer exactly to the years of the
&s;everal emperours on who&s;e coins it is found<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">Ni&s;i enim hoc modo in nummis Titi, Domitiani &amp; Nervae epo|cha haec explicetur, impo&s;&s;ible e&s;t nummos inter &s;e po&s;&s;e convenire; cum eorum imperii annos non excedat, &s;ed ad amu&s;&s;im iis re&s;pondeat. Pagi. ibid.</NOTE>. And
Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI> is of opinion, that it was an epocha chiefly
u&s;ed by the people of <HI>Syria</HI> and <HI>Egypt,</HI> becau&s;e the
epithet <HI>&s;acred</HI> is more common upon their coins than
any others<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Et nullibi &s;acri nomen frequentius, quam in nummis in Syria &amp; Aegypto percu&s;&s;is, u&s;urpatum. ibid. n. iv.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>AND I cannot but think, that there were for &s;ome
time different computations of the length of <HI>Nerva</HI>'s
and <HI>Trajan</HI>'s reigns; and that they were owing to this,
that <HI>Trajan</HI> was for &s;ome time <HI>Nerva</HI>'s Collegue in the
empire. Mr. <HI>Dodwell</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Vid. Append. ad Di&s;&s;ert. Cypr. n. 39, 40.</NOTE> was of opinion, that <HI>Nerva</HI>

well accounted for upon the &s;uppo&s;ition, that they
had met with different computations of the time of the&s;e
two Princes reigns, in &s;ome ancient writers: And their
mi&s;take is not ea&s;ie to be accounted for otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>As for <HI>Tiberius,</HI> I take it for granted, that it has
been fully proved, that he was for &s;ome time partner in
the empire with <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> and particularly that it has
been made appear that <HI>Pi&s;o</HI> was Prefect of <HI>Rome</HI> twenty
years, and that he was put into that Po&s;t by the ap|pointment

<P>AND it is highly probable, that the fir&s;t Chri&s;tians

<P>THAT we have &s;o few examples of this way of com|puting
the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> is not to be wondered; con|&s;idering
how few ancient writers who lived near his time
are come down to us, and e&s;pecially &s;uch as lived in
the provinces, where this epocha mu&s;t have been chiefly
u&s;ed. The di&s;tinct computation of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s reign to

<P>THERE is however a con&s;iderable difficulty attend|ing
this matter, becau&s;e <HI>Velleius</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> differ
about the time in which the law was pa&s;&s;ed by the Se|nate,

provinces and armies. According to <HI>Suetonius</HI> this law
was not pa&s;&s;ed till after <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s triumph, which cer|tainly
happened, A. U. 765. A. D. 12. But accord|ing
to <HI>Velleius</HI><NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Sueton. in Tiber. c. 21, 22. Velleius Pat. l ii. c. 121. Their words are tran&s;cribed above, p. 471.</NOTE> this law was pa&s;&s;ed at the de&s;ire of
<HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> before <HI>Tiberius</HI> returned to <HI>Rome</HI> from <HI>Ger|many</HI>
to make his triumph. Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Vid. Crit. A. Ch. 11. n. x.</NOTE> is inclined
to prefer the te&s;timony of <HI>Velleius Paterculus</HI> before that
of <HI>Suetonius,</HI> becau&s;e <HI>Velleius</HI> was contemporary with
<HI>Tiberius.</HI> But yet he dares not be po&s;itive in this mat|ter,
becau&s;e St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s numbers are different from
both. However, as <HI>Tiberius</HI> was Con&s;ul in the 21&s;t,
and 31&s;t years of our Lord, he judges this piece of re|&s;pect
to the tenth and twentieth years from the 11th year

<P>As he thinks it mo&s;t probable, that <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Pro|con&s;ular

is pretty well &s;atisfied as to the month and day of the

month; which he thinks was the 28th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> or
vth of the <HI>Kalends</HI> of <HI>September.</HI> One rea&s;on for it is,
that from the 725th year of the City, <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> &s;eems to
have had a particular re&s;pect for the vth of the <HI>Kalends</HI>
of months. Moreover, according to the &s;econd compu|tation
which <HI>Clemens Alexandrinus</HI> mentions of the reign
of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> it mu&s;t have begun on the 28th of <HI>Augu&s;t.</HI>
St. <HI>Clement</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> reigned twenty &s;ix years,
&s;ix months, nineteen days. Now <HI>Tiberius</HI> dies the 16th
of <HI>March,</HI> A. D. 37. From the 28th of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> A. D.
10. to the 16th of <HI>March,</HI> A. D. 37, are exactly (ac|cording
to Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI>'s reckoning) &s;o many years, months,
and days as St. <HI>Clement</HI> mentions. So that though St.
<HI>Clement</HI> has been in the wrong as to the year, &s;ince he
begins this computation of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign, A. D. 10;
yet he has helped us to the month and day of the month
on which it commenced.<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Quare Clemens Alexandrinus rei ge&s;tae diem nobis con&s;ervavit, &s;ed numeri annorum corrupti, quod in eo auctore non infrequen$. Pagi. Critic. A. D. 11. n. ix.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>I HAVE repre&s;ented the Doctor's &s;en&s;e of this mat|ter,
as well as I can, in a few words. But I cannot &s;ay,
that this rea&s;oning is altogether convincing. I mu&s;t ac|knowledge,
I &s;ee now how any argument can be drawn
from St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s te&s;timony, either for the year or
month of this epocha; if his numbers have been altered,
as the Doctor allows they have been in many places, and
particularly in this very pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>THERE appears to me &s;ome weight in the Doctor's
ob&s;ervation upon the <HI>Quinquennals</HI> and <HI>Decennals</HI> of this
epocha: But yet it is not fully conclu&s;ive. There might
be &s;ome other rea&s;on, be&s;ide that here &s;uppo&s;ed, for
<HI>Tiberus</HI>'s taking the Con&s;ul&s;hip, A. D. 21, and 31. The
22d, and 26th years of the Chri&s;tian Aera are as re|markable
as any other for the founding of cities, dedi|cating
temples, and erecting of monuments. Though
indeed, if this epocha began in the middle of any year,
it is obvious at fir&s;t &s;ight, that the&s;e honours may be
divided betwixt two years.</P>
<P><PB N="488" REF="506">
AND perhaps <HI>Velleius Paterculus</HI> and <HI>Suetonius</HI> may
be reconciled by &s;uppo&s;ing only, that there was &s;ome
time between <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s propo&s;ing <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s partner&s;hip
with him to the Senate, and the pa&s;&s;ing of the Act.</P>
<P>UPON the whole, I think, there is good rea&s;on to
believe, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> was Collegue in the empire with
<HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> and that this epocha of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s empire was
followed for &s;ome time by &s;ome per&s;ons, in the provinces
at le&s;t: but it appears to me uncertain, when this Pro|con&s;ular
empire began, whether about <HI>two</HI> years, or
about <HI>three</HI> years before <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> died.</P>
<P>LET us however adju&s;t the numbers in St. <HI>Luke</HI> to
this computation of the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> which com|menced
either about two years, or about three years
before his &s;ole empire after the death of <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> And
we will have an eye to the two dates of oar Saviour's
nativity abovementioned, <HI>&s;c. September</HI> or <HI>October,</HI> A. U.
748, and 749.</P>
<P>IF <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Procon&s;ular empire began about <HI>three</HI>
years before <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> died, <HI>&s;c.</HI> the 28th of <HI>Aug.</HI> A. U.

<HI>January</HI> following in A. U. 779. A. D. 26: Then
upon the &s;uppo&s;ition that Je&s;us was born in <HI>September,</HI>
A. U. 748, he would be at his bapti&s;m thirty years of
age and &s;ome months over.</P>

<HI>two</HI> years before the death of <HI>Augu&s;tus, &s;c.</HI> A. U. 765.
A. D. 12, then the fifteenth of the reign of <HI>Tiberius</HI> be|gan
in A. U. 779. A. D. 26. And &s;uppo&s;ing that <HI>John

and that Je&s;us was baptized by him the 6th of <HI>January</HI>
following, A. U. 780. A. D. 27, then, upon the &s;up|po&s;ition
that Je&s;us was born in <HI>September,</HI> A. U. 749,
he would be at the time of his bapti&s;m thirty years of
age and &s;ome months over: Or, if born A. U. 748,
<PB N="489" REF="507">
he would be &s;omewhat more than thirty one years of
age.</P>
<P>WE will put this matter one way more. If <HI>John the
Bapti&s;t</HI> began his mini&s;try in the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius,</HI>
A. U. 778. A. D. 25. (as in the fir&s;t &s;tating of this
que&s;tion) but did not baptize Je&s;us till the 6th of <HI>Ja|nuary,</HI>
A. U. 780. A. D. 27, after he had preached
&s;omewhat above a year, then Je&s;us would be at his
bapti&s;m thirty years of age and odd months, if he was
born, A. U. 749; thirty one years of age and &s;ome
odd months, if born the latter end of the year 748.</P>
<P>I SEE not but that we have a very good right to take
tho&s;e dates of the&s;e events, which appear mo&s;t favourable
to St. <HI>Luke;</HI> &s;ince it is not ab&s;olutely certain when <HI>He|rod</HI>
died, or when <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Procon&s;ular empire began:
nor have any of the writers of harmonies determined,
that I know of, beyond contradiction, the &s;pace of time
between the commencement of <HI>John the Bapti&s;t</HI>'s mini|&s;try
and our Saviour's bapti&s;m. But if we allow on each
hand the dates the le&s;t favourable to St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s numbers,
<HI>viz.</HI> that Je&s;us was born, A. U. 748. and that he was
not baptized till <HI>January,</HI> A. U. 780. A. D. 27; yet
even then Je&s;us would be little more (as has been
&s;hewn) than thirty one years of age; at which time a
per&s;on may be &s;aid very properly to be ABOUT <HI>thirty
years of age,</HI> as will appear by and by.</P>
<P>I IMAGINE I have now &s;hewed, that there is nothing
improbable in the &s;uppo&s;ition, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> computed
the reign of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> not from his &s;ole empire after the
death of <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> but from the time of his Procon&s;u|lar
empire, when he had equal power with <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> gi|ven
him in all the provinces and armies, and that upon
this &s;uppo&s;ition, there lies no objection again&s;t the age
a&s;cribed to Je&s;us at his bapti&s;m.</P>
<P>&sect; III. HOWEVER, in order to compleat this &s;olu|tion
of this difficulty, it will be proper to con&s;ider &s;ome
other notes of time, which we find in the Evangeli&s;ts;
and to enquire, whether the&s;e likewi&s;e agree with this

the affairs of <HI>Judea,</HI> commanded <HI>Pilate</HI> to go to

High Prie&s;t and all its Ornaments, as they had done
formerly.&mdash;Having conferred the&s;e favours upon

the High Prie&s;t <HI>Jo&s;eph,</HI> who is likewi&s;e called <HI>Caia|phas,</HI>
and &s;ub&s;tituted in his room <HI>Jonathan</HI> the &s;on of

him&s;elf with <HI>Herod</HI> the Tetrarch and their friends

<P>A FEW remarks on this account will &s;uffice.</P>
<P>IT is now expre&s;sly &s;aid, which fea&s;t of the <HI>Jews</HI> the
la&s;t mentioned fea&s;t was: But there can be no doubt,
but that it was the Pa&s;&s;over, A. D. 37. I think this is
<PB N="492" REF="510">
not conte&s;ted by any one. <HI>Tiberius</HI> died the 16th of
<HI>March.</HI> A. D. 37. The news of his death might ea&s;ily
reach <HI>Judea</HI> by the Pa&s;&s;over of that year, and could not
be retarded to the fea&s;t of <HI>Penteco&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>THE Pa&s;&s;over fir&s;t mentioned in this account mu&s;t
have been the Pa&s;&s;over, A. D. 36. It is evident, that
the &s;ummer following <HI>Vitellius</HI> went as far as the river
<HI>Euphrates,</HI> and returned to <HI>Antioch:</HI> and the next &s;pring
he was to go and make war with <HI>Aretas.</HI> But whil&s;t his
troops marched toward <HI>Petra,</HI> he went up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>
at the Pa&s;&s;over in the year thirty &s;even, as has been ob|&s;erved.
Nothing can be plainer, I think, than that
<HI>Pilate</HI> was removed before the Pa&s;&s;over in thirty &s;ix.
And mu&s;t have been out &s;ome time before. <HI>Vitellius</HI> did
not go to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> immediately after he had &s;ent away
<HI>Pilate,</HI> but fir&s;t ordered his friend <HI>Marcellus</HI> to take
care of affairs there.</P>
<P>IT is not &s;aid here, how long <HI>Pilate</HI> had been out,
before <HI>Vitellius</HI> went up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> but it is proba|ble,
it was half a year. This may be concluded from
hence: <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Vitellius,</HI> when he was at <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI>
the fir&s;t time here &s;poken of, put the High
Prie&s;t's ve&s;tment into the Prie&s;t's hands to be kept by
them in the temple. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> is very expre&s;&s;e, that this
favour was conferred by <HI>Vitellius</HI> upon the nation at this
time, and that having done &s;o, he put out <HI>Caiaphas</HI> and
returned to <HI>Antioch.</HI> Now in another place <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays:
&startq;This Ve&s;tment King <HI>Herod</HI><NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Ant. lib. xv. c. xi. &sect;. 4.</NOTE> kept here [<HI>in the Ca&s;tle
of</HI> Antonia]. And after his death it was kept in the
&s;ame place by the <HI>Romans</HI> till the time of <HI>Tiberius Ce|&s;ar.</HI>
In his reign <HI>Vitellius</HI> pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria,</HI> having
come to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and the people receiving him in
a very honourable manner, he being willing to make
<PB N="493" REF="511">
them a &s;uitable return, &s;ince they had de&s;ired that the
&s;acred ve&s;tment might be in their own cu&s;tody, wrote
to <HI>Tiberius Ce&s;ar</HI> about it, and he granted their re|que&s;t&endq;
From this pa&s;&s;age it appears, that <HI>Vitel|lius</HI>
did not put the High Prie&s;t's Ve&s;tment into the
hands of the <HI>Jews</HI> without leave from <HI>Tiberius.</HI> If <HI>Vi|tellius</HI>
actually made this grant, when he was at <HI>Jeru&s;a|lem</HI>
at the Pa&s;&s;over, A. D. <HI>thirty &s;ix,</HI> (as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays
expre&s;sly in the fir&s;t pa&s;&s;age) it is likely the <HI>Jews</HI> had
&s;ent their reque&s;t to him about the time that <HI>Pilate</HI> was
removed. And con&s;idering the &s;lowne&s;&s;e of <HI>Tiberius</HI> in
all his proceedings, it will not be thought &s;trange, that
we allow half a year between the <HI>Jews</HI> pre&s;enting their
reque&s;t to <HI>Vitellius</HI> in <HI>Syria,</HI> and the return of an an&s;wer
from the Emperour: It is rather &s;urprizing it &s;hould
have come back &s;o &s;oon.</P>
<P>IT is po&s;&s;ible that &s;ome may except again&s;t this ar|gument,
and &s;ay, that the grant was not made by <HI>Vi|tellius,</HI>
when he was at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> but that he there re|ceived
the <HI>Jews</HI> reque&s;t, then wrote to <HI>Tiberius,</HI> and
&s;ome time after this put the &s;acred Ve&s;tment into their
cu&s;tody. But though <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> does in this la&s;t pa&s;&s;age
&s;eem to place things in this order; yet I &s;hould think
that &s;ince in the pa&s;&s;age fir&s;t cited, he &s;ays <HI>Vitellius</HI> be|&s;towed
this favour upon the <HI>Jews,</HI> whil&s;t at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI>
at that time; it may be inferred, that the petition had
been pre&s;ented to him whil&s;t in <HI>Syria,</HI> and that he
brought <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s grant to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with him.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, though this argument &s;hould not be
allowed me, yet &s;ince upon <HI>Pilate</HI>'s removal <HI>Marcellus</HI>
was &s;ent to govern in <HI>Judea,</HI> it is plain there was &s;ome
time between <HI>Vitellius</HI>'s i&s;&s;uing his order to <HI>Pilate</HI> to go
to <HI>Rome,</HI> and his own Journey to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> This time
might be the &s;pace of five or &s;ix months, and I appre|hend
that the probability at le&s;t of my rea&s;oning above,
that <HI>Vitellius</HI> received the <HI>Jews</HI> petition for keeping the
High Prie&s;t's Ve&s;tment in <HI>Syria,</HI> then wrote to <HI>Tiberius,</HI>
and delivered it to them, when he was at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
may very much di&s;po&s;e us to admit the &s;uppo&s;ition of
this &s;pace.</P>
<P><PB N="494" REF="512">
AND though it &s;hould be thought, that at the Pa&s;|&s;over
next after <HI>Pilate</HI>'s removal <HI>Vitellius</HI> did not give the
High Prie&s;t's Ve&s;tment into the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> hands, but only
received their petition for the favour; yet this does
fully overthrow the opinion of tho&s;e, who have thought,
that <HI>Pilate</HI> was removed but a few weeks before the
death of <HI>Tiberius. Vitellius,</HI> after the removal of <HI>Pilate,</HI>
was at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> at a Pa&s;&s;over; and having been mag|nificently
received by the <HI>Jews,</HI> in requital of their ci|vilities

that they might have the keeping of the High Prie&s;t's

was not that Pa&s;&s;over, at which <HI>Vitellius,</HI> being at
<HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> heard of the death of <HI>Tiberius.</HI> We are
therefore fully a&s;&s;ured, that the Pa&s;&s;over which followed
the removal of <HI>Pilate</HI> was not the Pa&s;&s;over, A. D. 37,
before which <HI>Tiberius</HI> died, but the Pa&s;&s;over preceding,
<HI>viz.</HI> that in A. D. 36.</P>
<P>IT is certain then, that <HI>Pilate</HI> was removed before
the Pa&s;&s;over, A. D. 36; and probable, that he was re|moved
about five or &s;ix months before it, namely, about
<HI>September</HI> or <HI>October,</HI> A. D. 35, about a year and a half
before the death of <HI>Tiberius.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;pent <HI>ten</HI> years in
<HI>Judea;</HI> he came thither about <HI>October,</HI> A. D. 25, or
at le&s;t before the Pa&s;&s;over, A. D. 26, in the twelfth
year of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s &s;ole empire, which twelfth year began
the nineteenth of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> A. D. 25. This al&s;o is per|fectly
con&s;i&s;tent with what <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays of <HI>Valerius
Gratus,</HI> the fir&s;t Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> under <HI>Tiberius;</HI>
&startq;that he &s;pent eleven years in <HI>Judea,</HI> and was then &s;uc|ceeded
by <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI><NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 18. c. 2. &sect;. 2.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>So that though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Pro|con&s;ular empire began three years before the death of
<HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> as Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI> is inclined to do, <HI>&s;c.</HI> 28 <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI>
A. U. 764. A. D. 11; yet <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> would even
<PB N="495" REF="513">
then be in <HI>Judea</HI> in the fifteenth of that Empire, which
began <HI>Aug.</HI> 28, A. U. 778. A. D. 25.</P>
<P>THERE is one difficulty, and but one in all this
matter. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays that &startq;<HI>Pilate</HI>&mdash;ha&s;tened away
to <HI>Rome</HI> in obedience to the commands of <HI>Vitellius,</HI>
not daring to refu&s;e. But before he got to <HI>Rome,
Tiberius</HI> was dead.&endq;</P>
<P>IT will be be&s;t to take the objection from Mr. <HI>Whi|&s;ton.</HI>
&startq;Now it is known from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> that <HI>Pontius Pi|late</HI>
was Procurator of <HI>Judea</HI> but ten years; and that
he was put out &s;o little before the death of <HI>Tiberius,</HI>
that the Emperour was actually dead before <HI>Pilate</HI> ar|rived
at <HI>Rome</HI> to an&s;wer for him&s;elf. <HI>Tiberius</HI> died
<HI>March</HI> 26.<NOTE N="z" PLACE="foot">I &s;uppo&s;e that Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> herein follows <HI>Dio</HI> (unle&s;s it be a fault of the pre&s;s): But according to <HI>Suetonius</HI> and <HI>Tacitus, Tiberius</HI> died the 16th of <HI>March.

of his office a month, or &s;ix weeks before, &s;uppo&s;e
it <HI>February,</HI> from thence we mu&s;t count ten years
backward for the beginning of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s government,
which will therefore fall into <HI>February,</HI> A. D. 27.<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><HI>Whi&s;ton</HI>'s &s;hort view of the harmony of the four Evangeli&s;ts&punc; pag. 139.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS is the difficulty: But I think, it would be ve|ry
wrong to be determined by one &s;ingle &s;entence again&s;t
all the evidence which ari&s;es from the whole &s;eries of a
narration. It is extremely evident, that the fea&s;t time,
in which <HI>Vitellius,</HI> being at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> heard of the
death of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> is not the Pa&s;&s;over which followed
next after <HI>Pilate</HI>'s removal. I &s;hall not repeat particu|lars,
but content my &s;elf with referring the reader to
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s account, already tran&s;cribed.</P>
<P>AND if this one &s;entence about the time of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s
arrival at <HI>Rome</HI> be incon&s;i&s;tent with the re&s;t of the &s;tory;
it is more rea&s;onable to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was mi&s;|taken
in this particular, than in every thing el&s;e. He
might be mi&s;informed about the time when <HI>Pilate</HI> got
to <HI>Rome,</HI> but he could not well be ignorant of &s;ome of
the mo&s;t remarkable events in his own country, that is,
<PB N="496" REF="514">
when <HI>Pilate</HI> left <HI>Judea,</HI> when <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> and
his &s;ucce&s;|&s;or
<HI>Jonathan</HI> were put out of the High Prie&s;t's Office.</P>
<P>BUT there is no rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, this particular is
incon&s;i&s;tent with the other circum&s;tances mentioned in
this relation. Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton</HI> indeed can allow but a <HI>month</HI>
or <HI>&s;ix weeks</HI> between the time of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s removal out of
his office and his arrival at <HI>Rome.</HI> But it ought to be
con&s;idered, that <HI>Pilate</HI> was not &s;ent to <HI>Rome</HI> in order to
take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a kingdome or &s;ome new ample pro|vince,
but to an&s;wer for his conduct in his late govern|ment.
Nor was he &s;ent expre&s;s: Nor was he recalled
by the Emperour him&s;elf. But he was &s;ent away by
<HI>Vitellius,</HI> a fellow &s;ubject, though a &s;uperiour officer.
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Pilate ha&s;tened away to Rome.</HI> I
have given his words the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e in the tran&s;la|tion:
but I think, the meaning is no more than that he
went away out of <HI>Judea.</HI> And <HI>Jo&s;ehus</HI> intimates very
plainly the reluctance with which <HI>Pilate</HI> obeyed <HI>Vitellius,</HI>
when he &s;ays, that he went, not <HI>daring to refu&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>THERE was, if I mi&s;take not, &s;ome law under the
Commonwealth, which required the Governours of pro|vinces
to be at <HI>Rome</HI> in three months time after their
term of government was expired: But whether that law
was in force now, I cannot &s;ay. However it is plain it
was not ob&s;erved: <HI>Pi&s;o</HI>'s conduct is a proof of it. <HI>Ger|manicus</HI>

up among&s;t his other crimes.</P>
<P>AND to add no more, the &s;lowne&s;&s;e of <HI>Tiberius</HI> in
all his proceedings may help us to account for <HI>Pilate</HI>'s
delays in going to <HI>Rome,</HI> though it be &s;uppo&s;ed that he
made a year and a half of it.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI> &s;ays, that <HI>Tiberius</HI> was the mo&s;t di|latory
Prince that ever lived<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. lib. 18. pag. 811. v. 3.</NOTE>. His conduct toward
<HI>Herod Agrippa</HI> affords a &s;trong proof of it. A &s;ervant of
<HI>Agrippa</HI> waited upon the Prefect of <HI>Rome,</HI> a&s;&s;uring him
he had &s;ome informations of great con&s;equence to give
the Emperour relating to his ma&s;ter. The Perfect &s;ent
him to <HI>Tiberius;</HI> but he, without making any particu|lar
enquiry into the matter, only keeps the man &s;afe in
cu&s;tody. <HI>Agrippa</HI> lying under the Emperour's di&s;plea|&s;ure
was forced to make intere&s;t to have his &s;ervant
heard. And though he then informed the Emperour of
words &s;poken by <HI>Agrippa</HI> which were little le&s;s than
trea&s;on, and <HI>Agrippa</HI> was immediately thereupon con|fined;
yet he was never called for again, though <HI>Tiberius</HI>
lived &s;ix months<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;eph. Ant. 18. c. vii.</NOTE> after. <HI>Tacitus</HI> has mentioned ano|ther
<PB N="498" REF="516">
in&s;tance well nigh, or quite as remarkable<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Con&s;ultu&s;que Cae&s;ar <HI>an &s;epeliri &s;ineret, (De A&s;inio Gallo loquitur</HI>) non erubuit permittere, ultroque incu&s;are <HI>ca&s;us, qui reum ab&s;tuli&s;&s;ent antequam coram convinceretur.</HI> Scilicet medio triennio defuerat tempus &s;ubeundi judicium con&s;ulari &s;eni tot con&s;ularium parenti. Tacit. Ann. l. vi. c. 23.</NOTE>.
This &s;low way of thinking and acting was vi&s;ible in <HI>Ti|berius</HI>
in his very youth<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Saeva ac lenta natura ne in puero quidem latuit. Sueton. in Tiber. c. 57. Sed mitigavit Sejanus, non Galli amore, verum ut cunctationes principis aperirentur; gnarus eum lent$m in meditando. Tacit. Ann. lib. iv. c. 71.</NOTE>. And no hi&s;torian of tho&s;e
times is &s;ilent about it. <HI>Pilate,</HI> who had &s;erved <HI>Tiberius</HI>
ten years, could not be ignorant of what all the world
knew. He might have many probable rea&s;ons to think,
that if he did not come in the Emperour's way, he
&s;hould never be called for. If enquiry was made for
him, an excu&s;e might be found out that would &s;erve for
&s;ome time. Sickne&s;&s;e might be pretended, as a rea&s;on
for his &s;tay in <HI>A&s;ia, Achaia,</HI> or &s;ome other place where
he was got. Perhaps this was really the ca&s;e. To be
put out of his Government by <HI>Vitellius,</HI> upon the com|plaints
of the people of his province, mu&s;t have been a
very grievous mortification. <HI>Eu&s;ebius</HI> a&s;&s;ures us, that
not long after this <HI>Pilate</HI> made away with him&s;elf out of
vexation for his many misfortunes<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Eu&s;eb. Chron. p. 78.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THERE is another note of time mentioned in St. <HI>John</HI>'s
Go&s;pel, which ought al&s;o to be con&s;idered. <HI>Then &s;aid
the Jews, Forty and &s;ix years was this temple in building:
and wilt thou rear it up in three days?</HI> John ii. 20.</P>
<P>I SUPPOSE, that the objection to be formed upon
this text is to this effect. The&s;e words were &s;poken by
the <HI>Jews</HI> at the fir&s;t Pa&s;&s;over of our Saviour's public
mini&s;try, and the next after his Bapti&s;m by <HI>John.</HI> The
temple, which the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;poke of, was the temple then
before their eyes, and which <HI>Herod</HI> had rebuilt or re|paired.
But <HI>Herod</HI> did not make the propo&s;al for re|building
it till the eighteenth year of his reign, reckon|ing
<PB N="499" REF="517">
from the death of <HI>Antigonus.</HI> Therefore, if the
fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign mentioned by St. <HI>Luke</HI> be
the fifteenth of his Procon&s;ular empire, and not of
his &s;ole empire after the death of <HI>Augu&s;tus;</HI> this temple
could not have been &s;o long as <HI>forty &s;ix years</HI> in building,
at the time the&s;e words were &s;poken.</P>
<P>To this I might an&s;wer, That an objection taken
from <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s account of the time when <HI>Herod</HI> repaired
the temple can be of little moment: becau&s;e in one
place he &s;ays, that <HI>Herod</HI> repaired the temple in the fif|teenth
<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">De Bell. l. i. c. 21. init.</NOTE>, and in another the eighteenth year<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Ant. l. xv. c. xi. init.</NOTE> of
his reign. As the fifteenth year from the death of <HI>An|tigonus</HI>
is &s;uppo&s;ed to be coincident with the eighteenth
year from the time in which <HI>Herod</HI> was declared King of
<HI>Judea</HI> by the Senate of <HI>Rome;</HI> &s;ome may be di&s;po&s;ed to
conclude, that when <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays <HI>Herod</HI>'s propo&s;al to
rebuild the Temple was made to the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the eigh|teenth
year of his reign, he computes from the time in
which <HI>Herod</HI> was declared King by the Roman Senate.</P>
<P>BUT I do not in&s;i&s;t upon this, and am willing to al|low,
that <HI>Herod</HI> made the propo&s;al to the <HI>Jews</HI> of build|ing
their temple in the eighteenth year of his reign from
the death of <HI>Antigonus.</HI></P>
<P>AND I think it is as likely, that the <HI>Jews,</HI> in the&s;e
words recorded by St. <HI>John,</HI> refer to the time of <HI>Herod</HI>'s
propo&s;al, as to the time in which he began actually to
repair the temple. It is mo&s;t probable, that <HI>Herod</HI>
made this offer to the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> people, when a&s;&s;embled to|gether
at one of their great fea&s;ts. This therefore would
be the mo&s;t &s;olemn and remarkable epocha of rebuild|ing
the temple, which work undoubtedly he &s;et about
as &s;oon afterwards as he could.</P>
<P>AND it is very common to &s;ay, that men do things,
when they propo&s;e to do them, or begin to do them.
Thus <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays in his <HI>War of the Jews:</HI> &startq;In the fif|teenth
year of his reign he [<HI>Herod</HI>] repaired the tem|ple
it &s;elf, and enclo&s;ed a &s;pot of ground about it, of
<PB N="500" REF="518">
double the compa&s;s with that which &s;urrounded it be|fore.
This was done at a va&s;t expence, and is a proof
of his uncommon magnificence<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. De Bell. lib. i. cap. 21. init.</NOTE>.&endq; We will allow,
that the fifteenth year in this place ought to be correct|ed
by his <HI>Antiquities;</HI> where he &s;ays, that &startq;in the eigh|teenth
year of his reign <HI>Herod</HI> projected [or under|took]
the rebuilding the Temple, which was the
greate&s;t of all his works<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Ant. lib. xv. cap. xi. i$it.</NOTE>.&endq; But then it appears
from hence, that <HI>Herod</HI> is &s;aid by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> in one place
to <HI>do</HI> what in another he is only &s;aid at the &s;ame time to
<HI>propo&s;e</HI> or begin.</P>
<P>SUPPOSING, that the <HI>Jews</HI> in this text of St. <HI>John</HI>
refer to the time, in which <HI>Herod</HI> made the propo&s;al
of rebuilding the temple; we will &s;ee how this term of
forty &s;ix years will agree with the &s;uppo&s;ition, that
St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s fifteenth year of <HI>Tiberius</HI> is the fifteenth of his
Procon&s;ular empire.</P>
<P>IF the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s Procon&s;ular Empire be|gan
the 28th of <HI>Augu&s;t</HI> A. U. 778. A. D. 25. (accord|ing
to Dr. <HI>Pagi</HI>'s opinion) and if <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> began
to preach in <HI>November</HI> that year, but did not baptize
Je&s;us till after he had preached a year and &s;ome months,
then the Pa&s;&s;over at which the&s;e words were &s;poken was
the Pa&s;&s;over A. U. 780. A. D. 27.</P>
<P>OR if the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius</HI>'s reign began A. U.
779, A. D. 26, and <HI>John</HI> began then to preach, and
Je&s;us was baptized by him, &s;ome time before the pa&s;&s;o|ver
next following; &s;till the&s;e words would be &s;poke by
the <HI>Jews</HI> at the Pa&s;&s;over A. U. 780. A. D. 27.</P>
<P>THE eighteenth year of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, from the
death of <HI>Antigonus,</HI> is &s;uppo&s;ed to have begun &s;ome time
in A. U. 734. <HI>Herod</HI> might make his offer to the <HI>Jews</HI>
of rebuilding the Temple at the Fea&s;t of Tabernacles,
<PB N="501" REF="519">
in <HI>November</HI> that year. From <HI>November</HI> A. U. 734. to
the Pa&s;&s;over A. U. 780. A. D. 27, is almo&s;t forty five
years and an half. At this time therefore the <HI>Jews</HI> might
not improperly &s;ay, the temple had been <HI>forty &s;ix years
in building.</HI> The forty &s;ixth year was then current. And
it was to the purpo&s;e of the <HI>Jews,</HI> rather to add to,
than to dimini&s;h the time which had been &s;pent in that
work. So that there is no time more &s;uitable to the&s;e
words of the <HI>Jews</HI> than the Pa&s;&s;over A. D. 27. Though
there is no manner of incon&s;i&s;tence between under&s;tand|ing
the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius,</HI> of his Procon&s;ular empire,
and &s;uppo&s;ing that the&s;e words were &s;poken at the Pa&s;&s;o|ver
A. D. 28. And then the temple might have been
above forty &s;ix years in building.</P>
<P>WHAT has been here &s;aid, may be &s;ufficient to
&s;hew, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> might compute the reign of <HI>Tiberi|us</HI>
from the epocha of his Procon&s;ular Empire; that if
he did, Je&s;us might be &s;aid, with great exactne&s;&s;e and
propriety, to be <HI>about thirty years of age</HI> at his bapti&s;m;
and that there is nothing in this &s;uppo&s;ition incon&s;i&s;tent
with any other notes of time mentioned in the Go&s;pels.</P>
<P>&sect;. IV. ANOTHER way of &s;olving this difficulty is
this. The&s;e words of St. <HI>Luke, And Je&s;us him&s;elf be|gan

<P>ALL the other notes of time in the Go&s;pels are al&s;o

Pa&s;&s;over in the 12th year of <HI>Tiberius's</HI> &s;ole Empire,
A. U. 779, A. D. 26. (as has been &s;hewn): And con|tinued

Governour of <HI>Judea</HI> at the commencement of <HI>John</HI> the
<HI>Bapti&s;t's</HI> mini&s;try, and till after our Saviour's cruci|fixion.</P>

that they referred not to the time when <HI>Herod</HI> made the

all things in a readine&s;&s;e for it, and it will be ea&s;ily per|ceived
that the&s;e words are agreeable to truth.</P>
<P>I DO not pre&s;ume to determine, which of the&s;e two
&s;olutions is the ju&s;te&s;t: or whether St. <HI>Luke</HI> intended
the fifteenth of <HI>Tiberius's</HI> Procon&s;ular Empire when he
was made Collegue with <HI>Augu&s;tus,</HI> or the fifteenth of his
&s;ole Empire. In order to do this, it would be needful,
as I apprehend, to con&s;ider the time allotted by the
Evangeli&s;ts to the mini&s;try of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> and our
Saviour, the Chronology of the <HI>Acts</HI> of the <HI>Apo&s;tles,</HI>

<P>I APPREHEND, that each of the&s;e is a very good
&s;olution of the objection &s;tated at the beginning of this
chapter; though I believe many will think, it is there
&s;tated by me in a manner very favourable to an objector.
Nay, I imagine I have &s;aid what is &s;ufficient to &s;atisfy
any rea&s;onable per&s;on, that there does not lie any objec|tion
again&s;t any notes of time mentioned by the Evan|geli&s;ts
from the Chronology of other ancient writers.
This is &s;ufficient to my pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>I HAVE nothing farther to add here, be&s;ide this one
ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>IT is no di&s;paragement to the &s;acred Hi&s;torians, that
we are &s;omewhat at a lo&s;s to &s;ettle preci&s;ely the very
year of &s;ome of tho&s;e events which they have related.
Many important facts related by the be&s;t hi&s;torians are
attended with Chronological difficulties. I &s;hall give
but one in&s;tance, an in&s;tance with which we are nearly
concerned. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was a man of a learned educa|tion,
is a profe&s;&s;ed writer of hi&s;tory, of the civil and
&s;acred hi&s;tory of his country: and is generally allowed
<PB N="505" REF="523">
be an accurate writer. He has expre&s;ly mentioned two
epochaes of the commencement of <HI>Herod's</HI> reign, and
has given us an account of his death, and the duration
of his government. He has writ the hi&s;tory of the
whole reign of this Prince. He has related the &s;eries of
events, and the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Princes and Governours
of <HI>Judea</HI> before and after <HI>Herod.</HI> He has put down the
years of the <HI>Olympiads,</HI> and the names of the Con&s;uls,
when &s;ome of the mo&s;t remarkable of the&s;e events hap|pened.
Nor have all <HI>Roman</HI> and <HI>Greek</HI> hi&s;torians been
&s;ilent about <HI>Herod</HI> or his de&s;cendents, and the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> Af|fairs,
near this time: Not to mention <HI>Talmudical</HI> or
other <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> authors. And yet, notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e
advantages, whether through prejudice or want of &s;uf|ficient
light, it has happened, that learned men have
differed widely about the time of <HI>Herod's</HI> death, and are
not yet come to a full agreement.</P>

1. IT would be extremely unrea&s;onable to impute to
<HI>St Luke</HI> &s;o great a mi&s;take, as the &s;uppo&s;ing, that there
were properly two High-Prie&s;ts among the <HI>Jews</HI> at the
&s;ame time. He appears in the re&s;t of his hi&s;tory well
acquainted with <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> affairs. It is plain, that he knew
very well, there was one who was in the office of
High-Prie&s;t: ch. xxii. 50. <HI>And one of them &s;mote the &s;er|vant
of the</HI> HIGH-PRIEST.&mdash;54. <HI>Then took they him and
led him, and brought him to the</HI> HIGH-PRIEST'S <HI>hou&s;e.</HI></P>
<P>2. IT is likely, that the power which the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> peo|ple
were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of under the <HI>Romans</HI> was lodged chiefly
in the hands of two per&s;ons: and it may be &s;uppo&s;ed,
the <HI>Jews</HI> cho&s;e to have it &s;o. When they had re&s;olved
upon the War with the <HI>Romans, Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays: &startq;They
a&s;&s;embled in the temple, and appointed &s;everal Gene|rals.
And <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> the Son of <HI>Gorion,</HI> and the High|Prie&s;t
<HI>Ananus</HI> were cho&s;en to be &s;upreme gover|nours
<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> De Bell. 2. c. 20. &sect;. 3.</NOTE> of all things in the City.&endq; I have not ob|&s;erved
this pa&s;&s;age quoted by any upon this occa&s;ion:
Whether it be material or not, the reader will judge.
But it has inclined me to &s;uppo&s;e, that about this time
there were u&s;ually among the <HI>Jews</HI> two per&s;ons, to
whom the government was chiefly committed. I mu&s;t
however adverti&s;e the reader, that <HI>Ananus,</HI> here called
High-Prie&s;t, was not then in the office of the Prie&s;t|hood.</P>
<P>3. SINCE <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was now properly High-Prie&s;t,
and <HI>Annas</HI> had been &s;o: if the latter was now in &s;ome
po&s;t of authority, they might be both &s;aid very pro|perly
to be High-Prie&s;ts at this time. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> often

in que&s;tion, <HI>Annas</HI> had formerly been High-Prie&s;t, but
<HI>Caiaphas</HI> was now in that office.</P>
<P>I AM the more inclined to think, <HI>Jo&s;ephus's</HI> &s;tile here
parallel with St. <HI>Luke's;</HI> becau&s;e it appears from ano|ther
place, where <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> mentions this affair, that
<HI>Ananus,</HI> the third per&s;on named, was then Captain of
the Temple<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Ant. 20. c. 5. p. 889. v. 36.</NOTE>. From whence I conclude, that the
Three per&s;ons here mentioned were then in the three
chief po&s;ts of the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> civil and &s;acred Government.
He &s;peaks indeed of two others, whom he calls the <HI>mo&s;t
powerful of the Jews.</HI> But I apprehend they were &s;o
only in re&s;pect of their influence. It is rea&s;onable to
&s;uppo&s;e, that the per&s;ons named were in the mo&s;t emi|nent

<P>THERE is another particular, in which the&s;e two
pa&s;&s;ages are parallel: <HI>Jonathan,</HI> who had been High|Prie&s;t,

two names &s;tand in the &s;ame order in St. <HI>Luke.</HI> I &s;up|po&s;e,
<PB N="509" REF="527">
that the&s;e propo&s;itions may afford a clear &s;olution
of this difficulty.</P>
<P>THE learned <HI>Selden</HI> conjectures, that <HI>Annas</HI> and
<HI>Caiaphas</HI> are not mentioned in this place by St. <HI>Luke</HI> on
account of any <HI>&s;acred</HI> function they di&s;charged, but as
they were the two per&s;ons who had then the chief autho|rity
under the <HI>Romans</HI> in the <HI>Civil</HI> admini&s;tration of the
<HI>jewi&s;h</HI> affairs: that <HI>Annas</HI> was now Prince of the <HI>San|hedrim,</HI>

<HI>Annas</HI> is fir&s;t named, as being in the more honou|rable
&s;tation of the civil government. He &s;uppo&s;es

<P><HI>SELDEN</HI> offers the&s;e thoughts, as conjectures
only. I hope therefore, it will not be deemed pre|&s;umption,
<PB N="510" REF="528">
to be of another mind, or to offer &s;ome dif|ferent
thoughts upon this &s;ubject.</P>
<P>As <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was now in the office of the Prie&s;t|hood,
when <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI> began his mini&s;try; I
&s;uppo&s;e that <HI>Caiaphas</HI> is mentioned by St. <HI>Luke</HI> on the
account of the High Prie&s;thood, and the civil autho|rity
joined with it; and that, the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> government
being at this time under the <HI>Romans Ari&s;tocratical, An|nas</HI>
is mentioned together with <HI>Caiaphas,</HI> as being the
other chief per&s;on in the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> administration. But I
am of opinion, that we have not &s;ufficient light at pre|&s;ent
to determine, what Po&s;t of honour <HI>Annas</HI> was in,
though that of Prince of the <HI>Sanhedrim</HI> be as likely as
any. However, I cannot ea&s;ily per&s;wade my &s;elf, that
during the <HI>Jews</HI> &s;ubjection to the <HI>Romans,</HI> the Prince
of the Sanhedrim, or any other <HI>Jew,</HI> not in the High
Prie&s;thood, was equal, much le&s;s &s;uperior to him who
enjoyed that office; unle&s;s, when there was &s;ome <HI>jewi&s;h</HI>
Prince appointed Governour of the temple by the Ro|man
Emperour. If <HI>Jo&s;ephus's</HI> authority be &s;ufficient
to decide this matter, it is plain the High-Prie&s;t had
the chief power in the <HI>jewi&s;h</HI> nation under the <HI>Romans.</HI>
This may be concluded from hence, that he has pre|&s;erved
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the High-Prie&s;ts, and of them
only, to the de&s;truction of the temple. But if there
had been after the removal of <HI>Archelaus</HI> any per&s;ons in
an office of &s;uperior authority to the High-Prie&s;t, he
would have al&s;o given us their names. We &s;hould al&s;o
in all probability have met with &s;ome accounts in his hi|&s;tory,
of the putting out of the&s;e officers by the Ro|man
Governours, when they did not behave to &s;atisfac|tion.
And indeed <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;eems to me expre&s;ly to

<P><PB N="512" REF="530">
THERE are here two things which need to be ex|plained;
<HI>fir&s;t,</HI> Why <HI>Caiaphas</HI> is &s;aid to be High-Prie&s;t
<HI>that &s;ame year:</HI> And <HI>&s;econdly,</HI> What is meant by his
<HI>prophe&s;ying,</HI> being <HI>High-Prie&s;t.</HI></P>
<P>SOME have thought that the phra&s;e, <HI>being High|Prie&s;t
that year,</HI> implies that St. <HI>John</HI> &s;uppo&s;ed the
High Prie&s;thood was annual. And upon this account
they have been willing to charge him with a great mi|&s;take.
For <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> was Governour of <HI>Judea</HI> ten
years, and <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was put into the Prie&s;thood by
<HI>Valerius Gratus, Pilate's</HI> Predece&s;&s;or; and continued in
it, till after <HI>Pilate's</HI> removal. <HI>Selden</HI> thought that by
High-Prie&s;t is meant the chief man of that nation, and
particularly the Prince of the Sanhedrim, which po&s;t
might be at that time annual. For my own part, I
think, <HI>that year</HI> (as it ought to have been rendered, and
as the &s;ame phra&s;e is render'd <HI>ver.</HI> 51, and not <HI>that
&s;ame year</HI>) denotes no more than at <HI>that time.</HI> It is
very common to put <HI>years</HI> and <HI>days</HI> in the plural num|ber,
for time. <HI>After many</HI> DAYS <HI>thou &s;halt be vi&s;ited:
In the latter</HI> YEARS <HI>thou &s;halt come into the land that is
brought back from the &s;word,</HI> &amp;c. Ezek. xxxviii. 8. <HI>Then
&s;hall the offerings of Judah be plea&s;ant unto the Lord, as in
the</HI> DAYS <HI>of old, and as in the former</HI> YEARS, <HI>Mal.</HI> iii.
4. There are other texts perhaps more appo&s;ite to our
purpo&s;e. <HI>And thou &s;halt go unto the prie&s;t that &s;hall be in</HI>
THOSE DAYS, <HI>Deut.</HI> xxvi. 3. <HI>And he &s;hall dwell in that
City, until the death of the high prie&s;t that &s;hall be in</HI>
THOSE DAYS, <HI>Jo&s;h.</HI> xx. 6. <HI>Philo</HI> u&s;es the word <HI>day,</HI> in
the &s;ingular number, in the &s;ame manner: Speaking
of the trial of Jealou&s;y, he &s;ays, the man and the wo|man
&s;hall go up to the temple, &startq;and the man &s;tanding
before the altar &s;hall declare the cau&s;e of his jealou&s;y
in the pre&s;ence of him who is Prie&s;t at that<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> De Legibus &s;pecial. p. 785. C.</NOTE> day.&endq;
All that St. <HI>John</HI> &s;ays therefore is, that <HI>Caiaphas</HI> was
High-Prie&s;t at that time, or the High-Prie&s;t of that
<PB N="513" REF="531">
time. And if we ought to &s;uppo&s;e any thing emphati|cal
in the expre&s;&s;ion, (which yet I cannot &s;ee) I appre|hend
it ari&s;es from the di&s;tance between the time of the
event and the writing. St. <HI>John</HI> writing his Go&s;pel a
con&s;iderable time after the crucifixion of Je&s;us, when
many might be &s;uppo&s;ed to be ignorant who was then
High-Prie&s;t; and there having been under the <HI>Romans</HI>
frequent removals made in that office; it was natural
enough for him to expre&s;&s;e this circum&s;tance with &s;ome
peculiar empha&s;is, or to mention it more than once.</P>
<P>THE other difficulty to be con&s;idered lies in the
words: <HI>Being High-Prie&s;t that year he prophe&s;yed.</HI> Here
I cannot perceive the &s;en&s;e of this ob&s;ervation, &s;uppo|&s;ing
with <HI>Selden,</HI> High-Prie&s;t to &s;tand for Prince of the
Sanhedrim. By <HI>prophe&s;ying</HI> I under&s;tand in this place,
declaring the event; which it was in a peculiar man|ner
the office of the Prie&s;t to do, when he was enquired
of, or when God was enquired of<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot">Then the king &s;ent to call Ahimelech the <HI>PRIEST</HI> the &s;on of Ahitub.&mdash;And Saul &s;aid unto him, Why have ye con&s;pired again&s;t me, thou and the &s;on of Je&s;&s;e,&mdash;and ha&s;t <HI>ENQUIRED</HI> of God for him? 1 Sam. xxii. 11&mdash;13.

any important matters under deliberation. Thus
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays: &startq;But the <HI>Phili&s;tines,</HI> when they heard

the <HI>Jews</HI> (for he allowed not him&s;elf to do any thing

of the event from him) required the High-Prie&s;t
<PB N="514" REF="532">
to foretell him, what was the will of God, and
what would be the i&s;&s;ue of the battle. When he had
prophe&s;ied victory and power, he led out his forces

would have a &s;ure and ea&s;y victory: referring to the
&s;tory told, 2 <HI>Sam.</HI> v. 22&mdash;25.</P>
<P>LET us now apply the&s;e remarks in a general para|phra&s;e
of this text of St. <HI>John.</HI> Some of the council,
of a different opinion from tho&s;e who&s;e words are re|corded,
<HI>ver.</HI> 48, having, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed, from
con&s;iderations taken from the di&s;po&s;itions of the peo|ple,
the temper of the Roman Governour, and other
circum&s;tances of their affairs, expre&s;&s;ed &s;ome doubts
about the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of a pro&s;ecution of Je&s;us, and the
con&s;equences of taking away his life: &startq;<HI>Caiaphas,</HI> who
was the High-Prie&s;t at that time, when it came to
his turn to deliver his opinion, &s;aid: You have hither|to
talked very weakly and ignorantly: You may pro|ceed
in the ca&s;e before you without he&s;itation. The
taking<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE> away the life of this man will be &s;o far from
being ruinous to the whole nation in this country and
in other parts, as &s;ome of you fear, that it will be
much for the advantage of the people of God every
where. This however he &s;aid, not merely of him&s;elf:
but being then High-Prie&s;t, he foretold the i&s;&s;ue and
event of their coun&s;els and of the death of Je&s;us: And
that it<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"></NOTE> would come to pa&s;&s;e that Je&s;us would die

<P>MR. <HI>Ba&s;nage</HI> &s;ays, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has a&s;&s;ured us, <HI>Herod</HI>
had but three &s;ons left after the death of <HI>Antipater.</HI> I
think, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has never &s;aid any &s;uch thing. If he
had, he would be a writer of no weight; &s;ince he has
afterwards expre&s;ly &s;aid, that <HI>Herodias's</HI> fir&s;t hu&s;band
was <HI>Herod</HI> the &s;on of the High-Prie&s;t's daughter. And
if <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> had a&s;&s;ured us, <HI>Herod</HI> the Great had but
three &s;ons left after <HI>Antipater</HI> was dead, Mr. <HI>Ba&s;nage</HI>
might have &s;pared his arguments from the omi&s;&s;ion of
<HI>Herod</HI> the High-Prie&s;t's daughters &s;on, and the large
e&s;tate left to <HI>Salome</HI> in <HI>Herod</HI> the Great's la&s;t will.</P>
<P>INDEED, there is no rea&s;on to conclude that <HI>Herod,</HI>
&s;on of the High-Prie&s;t's daughter, died before his fa|ther:
but a great deal of rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e he &s;urvived
him, be&s;ide the expre&s;&s;e mention made of him long
afterwards, as the hu&s;band of <HI>Herodias.</HI> For in the will
his father made after the enquiries into <HI>Antipater's</HI> con|&s;piracy,
and therefore in the la&s;t year of his life, this

have been two other &s;ons of <HI>Herod,</HI> be&s;ide them and
<HI>Archelaus.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="521" REF="539">
BUT however <HI>Philo</HI> ought to be under&s;tood, I can0
never think it a fair way of getting rid of this difficulty
to charge <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> with a great many gro&s;s blunders.</P>
<P>2. I PROCEED thefore to lay before the reader ano|ther
&s;olution, which has been in the main approved of
already by many learned men.</P>
<P>(1.) THE Evangeli&s;ts and <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> are in the right,
and none of them have committed any mi&s;take in this
matter. I have ju&s;t &s;tiewn, that there is no rea&s;on to
think <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was mi&s;taken. And it is as unrea&s;ona|ble
to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Evangeli&s;ts are mi&s;taken. They
all agree in calling <HI>Herodias</HI>'s fir&s;t hu&s;band <HI>Philip.</HI> And
they appear to befully ma&s;ter of the hi&s;tory of <HI>Herod</HI> the
Great's family. One or other of them have told us, that
<HI>Archelaus</HI> &s;uceeeded his father in <HI>Judea;</HI> that <HI>Herod</HI> (who
was al&s;o called <HI>Antipas</HI>) was Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee, Philip</HI>
of <HI>Trachonitis.</HI> If they had not been well informed,
&s;ome errors would have appeared here. St. <HI>Luke</HI> has
given the proper titles and characters to all the other
de&s;cendents of <HI>Herod,</HI> whom he has mentioned after|wards
<HI>; Herod</HI> the King, <HI>Agrippa, Bernice, Dru&s;illa.</HI></P>
<P>THEY &s;peak of this unlawful marriage of <HI>Herodias,</HI>
as a matter they were well acquainted with; and <HI>Jo&s;e|phus</HI>
concurs with them in the main.</P>
<P>(2.) THE Evangeli&s;ts do not intend <HI>Philip</HI> the Te|trarch,
but the &s;ame per&s;on that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> does. If they
had intended <HI>Philip</HI> the Tetrarch when they &s;peak of
<HI>Herodias's</HI> hu&s;band, they would have given him his ti|tle.
This is their con&s;tant method. St. <HI>Matthew</HI> &s;ays,
that Je&s;us was born <HI>in the days of</HI> Herod <HI>the king,</HI> Matt.
ii. 1. St. <HI>Luke,</HI> that the vi&s;ion of <HI>Zacharias</HI> was <HI>in
the days of</HI> Herod <HI>the king of</HI> Judea, <HI>Luke</HI> i. 5. In the
account of our Saviour's return from <HI>Egypt</HI> St. <HI>Mat|thew</HI>
&s;ays, that <HI>Jo&s;eph</HI> heard that <HI>Archelaus</HI> did reign,
in <HI>Judea, in the room of his father</HI> Herod, <HI>Matth.</HI> ii. 22.
St. <HI>Luke</HI> gives the proper titles to all the princes whom
he mentions at the beginning of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t</HI>'s mi|ni&s;try.
In the account of <HI>Pilate</HI>'s &s;ending our Saviour
to <HI>Herod</HI> it appears plainly, that he was the Tetrarch
<PB N="522" REF="540">
of <HI>Galilee,</HI> to whom he was &s;ent, <HI>Luke</HI> xxiii. 6&mdash;8.
When St. <HI>Luke</HI> begins the hi&s;tory of <HI>Herod Agrippa,</HI> he
calls him <HI>the king,</HI> Acts xii. 1. He gives al&s;o the title
of <HI>King</HI> to <HI>Agrippa,</HI> Acts xxv. 13.</P>
<P>INDEED the church at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> in their prayer to
God give <HI>Herod</HI> and <HI>Pontius Pilate</HI> no titles, Act iv.
27. And I believe, none would have them there at
length. In the account of the death of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bap|ti&s;t,</HI>
and of this marriage, all the Evangeli&s;ts do ever
give <HI>Herod</HI> his title: <HI>Matt.</HI> xiv. 1. <HI>Mark</HI> vi. 14. <HI>Luke</HI>
iii. 19, ix. 7. But not one of them have given the
<HI>Philip</HI> whom they mention any title; but that <HI>Herod
had laid hold of</HI> John, <HI>and put him in pri&s;on for</HI> Hero|dias
<HI>&s;ake, his brother</HI> Philip'<HI>s wife,</HI> Matth. xiv. 3. or
bound him in pri&s;on <HI>for</HI> Herodias <HI>&s;ake, his brother</HI> Phi|lip's
<HI>wife, Mark</HI> vi. 17. Again: Herod <HI>the Tetrarch
being reproved by him for</HI> Herodias <HI>his brother</HI> Philip's
<HI>wife,</HI> Luke iii. 19. I make no doubt therefore but
that <HI>Philip, Herodia's</HI> fir&s;t hu&s;band, was a private per|&s;on,
who lived in all probability at <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and
that <HI>Herod</HI> the Tetrarch in his way to <HI>Rome</HI> there fell
in love with her, and made the contract. <HI>Philip</HI> then,
whom the Evangeli&s;ts &s;peak of, as the fir&s;t hu&s;band of
<HI>Herodias,</HI> was a private per&s;on, inverted with no titles
or dignities: &s;o is <HI>Jo&s;ephus's Herod,</HI> as appears from the
hi&s;tory I have given of him. And it is not unlikely,
that this was one rea&s;on, among others, why <HI>Herod</HI>
the Tetrarch's propo&s;al of marriage was &s;o &s;oon ac|cepted
by <HI>Herodias,</HI> an ambitious woman.</P>
<P>THE only difficulty therefore concerning this mat|ter
ari&s;es from the name. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> calls this per&s;on
<HI>Herod,</HI> the Evangeli&s;ts <HI>Philip:</HI> Moreover <HI>Philip</HI> was
the name of the Tetrarch of <HI>Iturea</HI> and <HI>Trachonitis;</HI>
therefore it may be thought &s;trange, that <HI>Herod</HI> the
Great &s;hould have another &s;on called <HI>Philip.</HI></P>
<P>THIS difficulty will be cleared by the following
con&s;iderations. It is not at all &s;trange, that <HI>Herod</HI> the
Great &s;hould have two &s;ons called by the &s;ame name,
when he had children by &s;even or eight wives. Even
<PB N="523" REF="541">
according to <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> the elde&s;t &s;on was called <HI>Antipa|ter,</HI>
and another, who was the younge&s;t, <HI>Antipas</HI> or
<HI>Herod Antipas,</HI> the Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee.</HI> The&s;e are but
one and the &s;ame name, only a different termination.
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> mentions three of <HI>Herod</HI>'s &s;ons of the name of
<HI>Herod,</HI> without any addition<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jo&s;. Ant. l. 17. c. 1. l. 18. c. 6. &sect;. 4. De Bell. l. 1. c. xxviii. &amp; Geneal. Herod. in Reland. Pale&s;t. Illu&s;tr.</NOTE>. But yet it is highly
probable, they had &s;ome other names by which they
were di&s;tingui&s;hed, though <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has not mentioned
them. <HI>Grotius</HI><NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">In <HI>Matth.</HI> xix. 3.</NOTE> thinks it very probable, there was
a <HI>Philip</HI> among the ance&s;tors of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great, after
whom two of his &s;ons were named <HI>Philip:</HI> as there were
two of them, who bore the name of <HI>Antipater</HI> or <HI>An|tipas</HI>
from his father.</P>
<P>THOUGH there was another brother by the &s;ame fa|ther,
namely <HI>Philip</HI> the Tetrarch, called by the &s;ame
name with <HI>Herodias</HI>'s hu&s;band; yet it was not nece&s;&s;ary
for the Evangeli&s;ts to take notice of it. When writers
relate a well known fact, near the time in which it hap|pened,
whil&s;t there is no danger of per&s;ons making a mi&s;|take,
this precaution is often neglected. <HI>Dio</HI>'s account
of <HI>Archelaus</HI>'s removal is thus: &startq;<HI>Herod</HI> of <HI>Pale&s;tine</HI> be|ing
accu&s;ed by his brothers was bani&s;hed to the other
<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">lib. 55. p. 767. B.</NOTE> &s;ide the <HI>Alps.&endq; Herod</HI> was the name by which the
Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee</HI> was u&s;ually called. And he al&s;o
was afterwards bani&s;hed to the other &s;ide the <HI>Alps.</HI> Yet
I believe, no one ever charged <HI>Dio</HI> with a mi&s;take here
as to the per&s;on he &s;peaks of, or &s;u&s;pected, that he
thought the Tetrarch of <HI>Galilee</HI> was bani&s;hed from his
dominions A. U. 759. I will tran&s;cribe here an ob|&s;ervation
of the learned and judicious Dr.<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Conn. Part II. year before Chri&s;t 81. p. 396.</NOTE> <HI>Prideaux.</HI>
&startq;He <HI>[Ptolemy Lathyrus]</HI> was &s;ucceeded by <HI>Cleopatra</HI>
his daughter, and only legitimate child. Her pro|per
name was <HI>Berenice,</HI> and &s;o <HI>Pau&s;anias</HI> calls her.
For it is to be noted, that as all the Males of this fa|mily
had the common name of <HI>Ptolemy,</HI> &s;o all the
<PB N="524" REF="542">
females of it had the name of <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> and be&s;ides
had other proper names to di&s;tingui&s;h them from each
other. Thus <HI>Selene</HI> was called <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> and &s;o were
al&s;o two other of her &s;i&s;ters. And in like manner,
this daughter of <HI>Lathyrus,</HI> who&s;e proper name was
<HI>Berenice</HI> bore al&s;o that of <HI>Cleopatra,</HI> according to the
u&s;age of her family. The ob&s;erving of this will re|move
many ob&s;curities and difficulties in the <HI>Egyptian</HI>
Hi&s;tory.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Evangeli&s;ts do all agree in calling <HI>Herodias</HI>'s
fir&s;t hu&s;band <HI>Philip:</HI> and they appear fully ma&s;ters of
their &s;tory. It is therefore highly rea&s;onable to &s;up|po&s;e,
he was called <HI>Philip</HI> as well as <HI>Herod.</HI> I &s;hall put
a ca&s;e re&s;embling this. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> always calls <HI>Livia,
Augu&s;tus</HI>'s wife<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Vid. Jo&s;. p. 1028. not. h.</NOTE>, Julia; though that was the proper
name of <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s daughter, without ever giving the
le&s;t hint of his rea&s;on for it. It is true, that though
the Roman hi&s;torians do generally call her <HI>Livia;</HI> yet
they have told us, that &s;he had al&s;o the name of <HI>Julia,</HI>
and have informed us of the rea&s;on of it; which was,
that <HI>Augu&s;tus</HI> in his la&s;t will adopted his wife into the
<HI>Julian</HI> family, and appointed that &s;he &s;hould bear the
name of <HI>Julia</HI><NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Tiberium &amp; Liviam heredes $$abuit. Livia in familiam Juliam nomen&abque; Augu&s;tae ad&s;umebatur. Ta|$it. lib. i. c. 8. vid. &amp; Sueton. Aug. c. 101. Dion. p. 600. A.</NOTE>. And there are medals, on which
&s;he bears this name. But if nothing of this had ap|peared
in any of the Roman authors, or in&s;criptions that
are extant; yet &s;ince <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> appears to be well ac|quainted
with the Roman affairs from <HI>Julius Ce&s;ar</HI>
down to his own time, I believe mo&s;t men would have
allowed that he had &s;ome good rea&s;on for calling the

&s;uppo&s;ition ought to be made in behalf of the Evange|li&s;ts

<P>IT was exceeding common among the ancients, <HI>Jews</HI>

is related in 2 <HI>Chron.</HI> xxiv. may &s;ay, that St. <HI>Matthew</HI>
mi&s;took the name of his father. For his name was <HI>Jeho|jada,</HI>
and not <HI>Barachias.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is another <HI>Zacharias,</HI> who&s;e death is related
by <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> But that happened not till long after the
time, in which our Saviour is &s;uppo&s;ed to have &s;poken
the&s;e words. This &s;eems to afford the mo&s;t formidable
objection. I &s;hall therefore &s;tate and con&s;ider it parti|cularly.
And in an&s;wering this I hope to an&s;wer al&s;o
the other two.</P>
<P>BEFORE I &s;tate this objection, I &s;hall here transcribe
the pa&s;&s;age <HI>of Jo&s;ephus,</HI> on which it is founded. I mu&s;t
a$ridge it indeed, but I &s;hall omit nothing that is ma|terial
to the point before us.</P>
<P>&startq;THE zealots, <HI>&s;ays Jo&s;ephus,</HI> were exceedingly en|raged again&s;t <HI>Zacharias</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE>, the &s;on of <HI>Baruch:</HI> for

lover of liberty, and moreover was very rich. They
call<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE> together therefore by a decree &s;eventy of the
chief of the people, and form a kind of Council de|&s;titute
of all authority. They then brought <HI>Zacha|rias</HI>
before them, and accu&s;ed him of a con&s;piracy
with the <HI>Romans:</HI> and in particular charged him
with &s;ending me&s;&s;engers to <HI>Ve&s;pa&s;ian,</HI> the better to
concert mea&s;ures for betraying them into his hands.&endq;
But they had no witne&s;&s;es. The facts were not proved.
<HI>Zacharias</HI> in a &s;peech he delivered before the Council
confuted all the calumnies of the <HI>zealots,</HI> and warmly re|proved
them for their wickedne&s;&s;e. &startq;The &s;eventy then
acquitted him, choo&s;ing rather to die with him, than
to bring upon them&s;elves the imputation of his death.
He being thus ab&s;olved, the zealots rai&s;ed a loud
clamour again&s;t tho&s;e Judges, as not under&s;tanding
the de&s;ign for which they had been inve&s;ted with au|thority.
And two of the mo&s;t daring of the zea|lots,
falling upon <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the middle of the
Temple, &s;lew him there<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. De Bell. l. 4. c. 5. &sect;. 4.</NOTE>.&endq;</P>
<P>IT maybe &s;aid then: From hence it appears, that
the writers of the&s;e books were not acquainted with the
affairs of tho&s;e times. The&s;e writings therefore do not
come from St. <HI>Matthew</HI> or St. <HI>Luke.</HI> At le&s;t the authors
of them did not live at the time they are &s;uppo&s;ed to
have lived: po&s;&s;ibly not till long afterwards. How
el&s;e could they have committed &s;uch a blunder, as to
make Je&s;us tell the <HI>Jews</HI> of his time, in the reign of
<HI>Tiberius,</HI> that they had killed <HI>Zacharias</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Ba|rachias,</HI>
or <HI>Baruch?</HI> when <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> informs us, that he
was not killed till the latter end of <HI>Nero's</HI> reign, above
thirty years after the&s;e words are &s;aid to have been &s;po|ken
by Chri&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="529" REF="547">
I. To this I an&s;wer, in the <HI>fir&s;t</HI> place, that the fact
related by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> does not &s;uit the words of Chri&s;t in
the Evangeli&s;ts.</P>
<P>FOR (1.) the name of the father of <HI>Zacharias</HI> &s;eems
to be different. Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI><NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">On <HI>Matth.</HI> xxiii. 35.</NOTE> ob&s;erves &startq;that as <HI>Ba|ruch</HI>

which &s;hows they were not the &s;ame name.&endq;</P>
<P>(2.) THEIR characters are not the &s;ame. The de|&s;ign
of our Saviour's di&s;cour&s;e obliges us to &s;uppo&s;e,
that the <HI>Zacharias</HI> he mentioned was a <HI>prophet:</HI> Where|as
the <HI>Zacharias</HI> in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has not that character from
him.</P>
<P>(3.) THE place, in which they are &s;aid to have
been &s;lain, is not the &s;ame. The <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the go|&s;pels
peri&s;hed <HI>between the temple and the altar,</HI> according
to both St. <HI>Matthew</HI> and St. <HI>Luke.</HI> But there is no
rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s <HI>Zacharias</HI> was &s;lain
in the inner court, in which the altar &s;tood. The
council was not held within that court: and <HI>Zacharias</HI>
&s;eems to have been &s;lain immediately after his ab&s;olu|tion
by the council. If he was &s;lain in any part of the
<GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> temple, that is perfectly agreeable to the
words of <HI>Jo&s;ephus;</HI> for under that name were com|prehended
the temple and all the courts and buildings
belonging to it.</P>
<P>THESE &s;everal in&s;tances of di&s;agreement, I &s;hould
think, mu&s;t incline mo&s;t per&s;ons to conclude, that the
&s;ame <HI>Zacharias</HI> was not intended by the Evangeli&s;ts
and <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI></P>
<P>BUT perhaps this is more than is rea&s;onable to ex|pect
&s;hould be allowed by an Objector. He can ea&s;ily
believe of writers who are in little credit with him, that
they may run far wide of the truth, and really in|tend
a fact that has but a &s;mall re&s;emblance with their
<PB N="530" REF="548">
relation. With &s;uch what hath been &s;aid hitherto will
have little weight.</P>
<P>I PROCEED therefore to &s;ome other con&s;iderations.
II. I SAY then, that our Lord, in the words we
are now con&s;idering, in&s;tanceth in facts &s;uppo&s;ed to
have been done a con&s;iderable time before. The whole
tenour and de&s;ign of his di&s;cour&s;e a&s;&s;ures us of it.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Zacharias</HI> he mentions is not one whom they
of that age had them&s;elves &s;lain, but rather one of tho&s;e
prophets who&s;e tombs they built.</P>
<P>THE &s;um of what our Saviour &s;ays (if I mi&s;take
not) is this: Ye &s;ay, <HI>If ice bad been in the days of our
fathers, we would not have been partakers with them
in the blood of the prophets.</HI> This you &s;ay; but, as
hereby you own, that you <HI>are the children of them that
killed the prophets;</HI> &s;o by your conduct, by your ma|lice,
your pride, your hypocri&s;y, your ob&s;tinate di&s;|obedience
to God, you make it appear that you allow
the deeds of your fathers, and are their genuine off|&s;pring.
You even exceed them in wickedne&s;&s;e. You
are now filling up, and you will &s;till go on to fill up
the mea&s;ure of their iniquity. I am come among you
in my father's name, and have done works which no
man ever did; but you do not hearken to me. My
words you do not receive, and me you will crucifie,
God will &s;till &s;end among you, as he did to your fa|thers,
prophets and wi&s;emen, to in&s;truct you in the
mo&s;t excellent doctrine, to admoni&s;h and reclaim you:
but ye will kill and crucifie them, &s;courge them in your
&s;ynagogues, and per&s;ecute them from city to city.
Hereby you will make the wicked deeds of your fa|thers
your own, and bring the guilt of them upon your
&s;elves: You will hereby de&s;erve, that all the righteous
blood &s;hed from the foundation of the world, from
the blood of righteous <HI>Abel</HI> to the blood of <HI>Zacharias,</HI>
&s;hould be required of you: and verily I &s;ay unto you,
<HI>it &s;hall be required of this generation.</HI></P>
<P>OUR Lord &s;eems to me to remind them of in&s;tances
of di&s;obdience and cruelty, which they were well ac|quainted
<PB N="531" REF="549">
with, <HI>which they avowedly condemned,</HI> and pre|tended
to &s;ee the evil of, but yet did, and would imi|tate
in a mo&s;t notorious manner: and hereby would
bring the guilt of them upon them&s;elves. And the
conclu&s;ion of all obliges us to &s;uppo&s;e, that the death
of the <HI>Zacharias</HI> he had mentioned, was an act of cru|elty
committed by their fathers. This is the &s;en&s;e of
the words in both the Evangeli&s;ts.</P>
<P>THIS appears to me &s;o evident, that if there had
been no event recorded in any of their ancient writings
which anfwered to the death of <HI>Zacharias</HI> here de&s;cri|bed
yet I &s;hould have &s;uppo&s;ed that there was &s;ome
&s;uch event, that had happened &s;ome time before, and
which they were then well acquainted with.</P>
<P><HI>III. HOWEVER, we have</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">See <HI>Whithy,</HI> Matth. xxiii, 36.</NOTE> <HI>a fact recorded in the</HI>
Old Te&s;tament <HI>which exactly an&s;wers the words of our
Saviour. It is in</HI> 2 Chron. <HI>xxiv.</HI> 17.&mdash;22. Now after
the death of Jehojada&mdash;they left the hou&s;e of the Lord
God of their fathers&mdash;and wrath came upon Judah and
Jeru&s;alem:&mdash;yet he &s;ent prophets unto them to bring them
again unto the Lord, and they te&s;tified again&s;t them: but
they would not give ear. And the &s;pirit of God came upon
Zachariah, the fin of <HI>Jehojada</HI> the prie&s;t, which &s;tood
above the people, and &s;aid unto them, Thus &s;aith God,
Why tran&s;gre&s;&s;e ye the commandment of the Lord? And
they con&s;pired again&s;t him, and &s;toned him with &s;tones at
the commandment of the king in the court of the hou&s;e of
the Lord. Thus Joa&s;h the king remembered not the kind|ne&s;s
which Jehojada his father had done to him, but &s;lew
his &s;on: and when be died, he &s;aid, the Lord look upon it
and require it.</P>
<P>THIS fact is exactly parallel with that de&s;cribed by
our Lord. (1.) This <HI>Zachariah</HI> &s;poke in the name
of the Lord <HI>(the &s;pirit of God came upon him).</HI> It was
&s;uitable to our Lord's de&s;ign to in&s;tance in the death of
a <HI>prophet. Ye &s;ay, if we had been in the days of our fa|thers,
we would not have been partakers with them in the
death of the</HI> PROPHETS.&mdash;<HI>I &s;end unto you</HI> PROPHETS, <HI>and
<PB N="532" REF="550">
wi&s;emen and &s;cribes. Abel</HI> was a <HI>righteous man,</HI> and this
<HI>Zacharias</HI> a <HI>prophet.</HI></P>
<P>(2.) THE place, in which this <HI>Zacharias</HI> is &s;aid to
have been killed, an&s;wers the de&s;cription in the Evan|geli&s;ts.
He was &s;lain in the <HI>court if the hou&s;e of the
Lord,</HI> that is, in the court of the prie&s;ts, the inner
court of the temple. In both the Evangeli&s;ts the &s;ame
place is &s;pecified, <HI>between the temple and the altar.</HI> This
particular circum&s;tance of &s;o remarkable an event was,
doubtle&s;s, handed down to them by tradition. Accord|ing
to the account in the <HI>Chronicles,</HI> he was in the inner
court when he delivered his me&s;&s;age from God to them:
<HI>He &s;tood above the people.</HI> The ground of the inner
court was rai&s;ed above the re&s;t. He &s;tood at the ex|tremity
of that, and &s;poke to the people &s;tanding in
the next court below him. <HI>At the commandment of the
King,</HI> they ru&s;hed in upon <HI>Zachariah.</HI> He retired,
they pur&s;ued him and <HI>&s;toned him with&s;tones,</HI> &s;o that he
fell down in the &s;pace between the altar of burnt-offer|ings
and the temple.</P>
<P>(3.) OUR Lord &s;ubjoins: <HI>whom</HI> YE SLEW. The
death of <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the <HI>Chronicles</HI> was the act of the
nation, of King and People. This particular is added
to this in&s;tance with the highe&s;t propriety. The death
of <HI>Abel</HI> was the death of <HI>righteous man,</HI> but not commit|ted
by them. The death of <HI>Zacharias</HI> was the act of
their ance&s;tors, that is, of that people to whom our
Lord was &s;peaking. For a nation is in all ages reckoned
the &s;ame people. <HI>And he an&s;wered and &s;aid unto them, what
did Mo&s;es command</HI> YOU? <HI>Mark</HI> x. 3. <HI>Verily I &s;ay unto
you, Mo&s;es gave</HI> YOU <HI>not that bread from heaven,</HI> John vi.
32. <HI>Did not Mo&s;es give</HI> YOU the law? <HI>Ch.</HI> vii. 19. See 22.</P>
<P>(4.) EXPRESSIONS made u&s;e of in the hi&s;tory of
<HI>Zacharias</HI> in the <HI>Chronicles,</HI> and by our Saviour in his
di&s;cour&s;e to the <HI>Jews,</HI> put it pa&s;t doubt that he intend|ed
this fact, and alluded to this very account in that
book. <HI>Behold I &s;end unto you prophets and wi&s;e men and
&s;cribes.</HI> The hi&s;tory in the <HI>Chronicles</HI> begins thus: <HI>Yet
he &s;ent unto them prophets to bring them again unto the
<PB N="533" REF="551">
Lord, and they te&s;tified again&s;t them,</HI> &amp;c. It concludes:
And when he died, he &s;aid, the Lord look upon il and require
it. Our Saviour tells the <HI>Jews, that the blood of all the
prophets would be required of that generation.</HI></P>
<P>(5.) As the fact related in the <HI>Chronicles</HI> does in all
its circum&s;tances an&s;wer that de&s;cribed by our Lord,
&s;o there is a &s;uitablene&s;&s;e in the order in which it &s;tands
in our Lord's di&s;cour&s;e. <HI>Abel</HI> is the fir&s;t. <HI>righteous man</HI>
&s;lain, and the death of <HI>Zacharias</HI> is the la&s;t act of cruel|ty
to a <HI>prophet</HI> related in the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> &s;acred writings.</P>
<P>IV. IT ought to be ob&s;erved, that there is an exact
harmony between the Evangeli&s;ts, in the account they
have given of this di&s;cour&s;e of our Saviour, though
there is no rea&s;on to think that one has copied the
other. This ought to &s;atisfy us that no mi&s;take has
been made.</P>
<P>IN one particular indeed there is a difference. In
St. <HI>Matthew Zacharias</HI> is &s;tiled the &s;on of <HI>Barachias,</HI>
whereas in St. <HI>Luke's,</HI> account it is not &s;aid who was his
father.</P>
<P>AND in this particular the per&s;on whom our Saviour
&s;peaks of &s;eems not to an&s;wer to him mentioned in the
<HI>Chronicles.</HI> For there he is called the &s;on of <HI>Jehojada.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is therefore but one objection again&s;t &s;up|po&s;ing,
that our Saviour meant the <HI>Zacharias</HI> in the
<HI>Chronicles.</HI> But it is &s;uch an objection, as de&s;erves
con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>IT has been ob&s;erved by<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Vid. Grot. &amp; Whitb, in loc.</NOTE> divers learned men, that
many per&s;ons among the <HI>Jews</HI> were called by two names,
e&s;pecially when their true name happened to have &s;ome
of the letters of the word <HI>Jehovah</HI> in it. For this rea&s;on
<HI>Barachias</HI> may have been u&s;ed for <HI>Jehojada,</HI> &s;ince like|wi&s;e
the&s;e two names have much the &s;ame meaning.</P>
<P>OTHER learned men &s;uppo&s;e, that <HI>Barachias</HI> was
very early in&s;erted into St. <HI>Matthew's</HI> Go&s;pel by &s;ome
tran&s;criber. There is the more rea&s;on for this &s;uppo&s;i|tion,
becau&s;e it is wanting in St. <HI>Luke.</HI> Or el&s;e <HI>Jeho|jada</HI>
might have been originally in St. <HI>Matthew,</HI> but
<PB N="534" REF="552">
&s;ome Chri&s;tian tran&s;criber not well acquainted with the
<HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> hi&s;tory, nor knowing who <HI>Jehojada</HI> was, and
therefore &s;u&s;pecting that to be a mi&s;take, might pretend
to correct it by putting <HI>Barachias</HI> in the room of <HI>Jeho|jada.
Zachariah</HI> the &s;on of <HI>Barachias,</HI> who&s;e prophe|cies
form one of the books of the <HI>Old Te&s;tament,</HI> was
certainly better known among the Chri&s;tians, than <HI>Za|charias</HI>
the &s;on of <HI>Jehojada.</HI> It is not at all unlikely
therefore, that our not having this name in St. <HI>Mat|thew</HI>
may be owing to the ignorance and ra&s;hne&s;&s;e of
&s;ome tran&s;criber. This, &s;uppo&s;ition &s;eems to be favour|ed
by what St. <HI>Jerome</HI> &s;ays, who informs us, that in
the <HI>Go&s;tel of the Nazarenes Zachariah</HI> is called <HI>the Son
of</HI><NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">In evangelio quo utuntur Nazareni, pro filio Barachiae, filium Jojadae reperimus &s;criptum. S. Hieron. comment, Matth. xxiii. 36.</NOTE> <HI>Jehojada.</HI></P>
<P>SOME have thought, that there is a like in&s;tance in
<HI>Matth.</HI> xiii. 35, where we have the&s;e words: <HI>That it
mig't be fulfilled which was &s;poken by the prophet &s;aying, I
will open my month in parables,</HI> &amp;c. The words of this
quotation are in <HI>P&s;.</HI> lxxviii. 2. the title of which is <HI>Ma&s;chil
of A&s;aph. St. Jerome</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">In loc.</NOTE> &s;ays, that in &s;ome copies
of St. <HI>Matthew</HI> was written: <HI>That it might be fulfilled
which was &s;poken by the prophet E&s;aias.</HI> He thinks it was
originally: <HI>which was &s;poken by the prophet A&s;aph.</HI> But
&s;ome tran&s;criber, not knowing <HI>A&s;aph</HI> to be a prophet,
put <HI>E&s;aias</HI> in his room. Afterward others, perceiving
there were no &s;uch words as tho&s;e which follow here to
be found in <HI>E&s;aias,</HI> le&s;t out his name. And from thence
forward in mo&s;t copies it was written, <HI>which was &s;poken
by the prophet,</HI> &s;aying, &amp;c.</P>
<P>I CRAVE leave to mention an ob&s;ervation, that
may &s;upport the former of the&s;e two &s;uppo&s;itions, <HI>viz.</HI>
that originally <HI>the &s;on of Barachias</HI> was wanting in St.
<HI>Matthew,</HI> as well as in St. <HI>Luke..</HI> The ancient Chri&s;ti|ans
&s;eem to have been very much divided in their opi|nion,
who was the <HI>Zacharias</HI> here &s;poken of. Many
Chri&s;tians in St. <HI>Jerome</HI>'s time thought he was <HI>Zacharias</HI>
<PB N="535" REF="553">
the father of <HI>John</HI> the <HI>Bapti&s;t;</HI> borrowing this notion
(as he<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Com. in Matth. xxiii. 56.</NOTE> adds) from &s;ome Apocryphal books of no
authority. In the copies of St. <HI>Matthew's</HI> Go&s;pel in
his time, he was &s;tiled the &s;on of <HI>Barachias,</HI> as in ours:
But the <HI>Nazarene</HI> Chri&s;tians, being <HI>Jews</HI> by birth, and
under&s;tanding the hi&s;tory of their own nation, had it in
their Go&s;pel, <HI>Zacharias the &s;on of Jehojada.</HI> This in|deed
was the truth, but it &s;eems to have keen an in&s;er|tion.</P>
<P>BUT this is left to the reader to judge of, as he thinks
fit. It is highly probable, that one of the&s;e may be the
ca&s;e; either that <HI>Jehojada</HI> not being well known, <HI>Ba|rachias</HI>
was put in his room; or el&s;e, that <HI>the Son of
Barachias,</HI> was added.</P>
<P>THERE being &s;o probable an account of this read|ing,
I hope there remains no farther &s;cruple about this
text.</P>
<P>THERE is another interpretation of the&s;e words, which
&s;ome have inclined to, namely, that the <HI>Zacharias</HI> here
mentioned is the <HI>Zacharias</HI> who&s;e death <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has gi|ven
us the hi&s;tory of: and that our Saviour &s;poke of
him by way of prophecy. But as there can be no ob|jection,
which I am concerned with, formed again&s;t
the Evangeli&s;ts from this &s;en&s;e of the words, I have
taken no notice of it.</P>
<P>BESIDES, I think it is by no means the true &s;en&s;e
of the place. Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> ob&s;erves very well, that
&startq;Chri&s;t &s;peaks here of the Prophets whom they had
&s;lain, not of one who was to be &s;lain a little before
the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> for then none of the
people could have under&s;tood his meaning.&endq;</P>
<P>By the whole tenour of our Saviour's di&s;cour&s;e, the
<HI>Zacharias</HI> he &s;peaks of is excluded from the number of
tho&s;e that were to be &s;lain. If the <HI>Zacharias,</HI> whom
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;peaks of, was as good a man as he repre&s;ents
him, and did faithfully reprove the wickedne&s;&s;e of the
prevailing party of his nation; he might be one of
<PB N="536" REF="554">
tho&s;e <HI>holy and wi&s;e men,</HI> whom our Saviour fore&s;aw
would be &s;lain by the <HI>Jews:</HI> But he can never be the
<HI>Zacharias</HI> whom our Saviour mentioned by name; for
he is one of tho&s;e <HI>prophets,</HI> which had been &s;lain before,
and who&s;e blood would be required of them.</P>

<P>_IT will be proper in the next place to con|&s;ider
the objection relating to <HI>Theudas.</HI>
The Apo&s;tles were brought before the
council at <HI>Jeru&s;alem: And when they took
coun&s;el to &s;lay them, Gamaliel commanded
to put the A O&s;tles forth a little &s;pace; and
&s;aid unto them, Ye men of I&s;rael take heed to your &s;elves,

<HI>Theudas</HI> as having given di&s;turbance before <HI>Judas</HI> of
<HI>Galilee,</HI> who in the days of the taxing drew away much
people. This refers doubtle&s;s to the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement made
by <HI>Cyrenius</HI> after <HI>Archelaus</HI> was depo&s;ed, when <HI>Judea</HI>
was reduced to a Roman<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Jo&s;. Antiq. lib. xvii. cap. ult. xviii. cap. 1. De B. Jud. lib. vii. cap. viii. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> Province: which happen|ed

It was at this time that <HI>Judas,</HI> whom <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> calls
<HI>Judas Gaulanites,</HI> and likewi&s;e <HI>Judas</HI> the <HI>Galilean,</HI> rai|&s;ed
di&s;turbances in that country.</P>
<P>BUT <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> gives us an account of an Impo&s;tor,
called <HI>Theudas,</HI> when <HI>Cu&s;pius Fadus</HI> was Procurator in
<HI>Judea;</HI> and therefore not before the fourth year of
<HI>Claudius</HI> the Roman Emperor A. D. 44. that is, &s;even
years after <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s &s;peech was made, according to
<HI>Cappellus</HI>'s computation, and ten years after it, accor|ding
to Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI>'s.</P>
<P><HI>JOSEPHUS</HI>'s words are the&s;e: &startq;Whil&s;t <HI>Fadus</HI>
was Procurator of <HI>Judea,</HI> a certain Impo&s;tor called
<HI>Theudas</HI> per&s;waded a very great multitude, taking their
effects along with them to follow him to the river <HI>Jor|dan</HI>
For he &s;aid he was a prophet, and that cau&s;ing
the river to divide at his command, he would give
them an ea&s;ie pa&s;&s;age over. By the&s;e &s;peeches he de|ceived
many. But <HI>Fadus</HI> was far from &s;uffering them
to go on in their madne&s;&s;e: for he &s;ent out a troop of
hor&s;e, who, coming upon them unexpectedly, &s;lew
many, and took many pri&s;oners. <HI>Theudas</HI> him&s;elf
was among the latter. They cut off his head, and
brought it to <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> The&s;e things happened in
<HI>Judea,</HI> while <HI>Cu&s;pius Fadus</HI> was Procurator<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Ant. 20. c. 4. &sect;. 1.</NOTE></P>
<P><PB N="538" REF="556">
IT may therefore be pretended, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> has
made a mi&s;take. The <HI>Theudas</HI> whom <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> men|tions
appeared not till &s;everal years after <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s
&s;peech was made. Nor has <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;aid any thing of

&s;ame name. He likewi&s;e <HI>boa&s;ted him&s;elf to be &s;ome body,</HI>
that is, <HI>a prophet.</HI> He was &s;lain, and his followers were
&s;cattered. In the&s;e particulars <HI>Gamaliel</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
agree. Therefore they mean the &s;ame per&s;on, but
they differ mod widely about the time. For which
reafon St. <HI>Luke</HI> mu&s;t have been mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>DIVERS &s;olutions have been offered of this dif|ficulty.</P>
<P>1. SOME &s;ay, St. <HI>Luke</HI> might put the affair of
<HI>Theudas</HI> into <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s &s;peech by way of anticipation.
He knew very well that <HI>Theudas</HI> did not appear till
after this time; but this being a very proper in&s;tance,
and &s;uitable to the main &s;cope and de&s;ign of the &s;peech
which <HI>Gamaliel</HI> made, He in&s;erted it him&s;elf. But this
is not at all agreeable to the &s;implicity of St. <HI>Luke</HI>'s
narration, e&s;paecially con&s;idering how particular he is as
to the number of <HI>Theudas</HI>'s followers: <HI>To whom a num|ber
of men, about four hundred joined them&s;elves.</HI> And
one would think <HI>Vale&s;ius</HI> was at a lo&s;s for examples of
anticipation, when the only one he produces is out of
a Poet, and that has &s;carce any re&s;emblance with this
before us<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><P>Alia quoque conciliandi ratio excogitari pote&s;t; &s;i dicamus B. Lucam in eo loco <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> locutum e&s;&s;e. Quae quidem figura occurrit interdum apud antiquos &s;criptores, exempli cau&s;a apud Vir|gilium, cum dicit:

<P>2. SOME think that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has been mi&s;taken,
and has mi&s;placed <HI>Theudas</HI>'s in&s;urrection. This &s;olu|tion
<HI>Vale&s;ius</HI> prefers before the former; and it is ap|proved
<PB N="539" REF="557">

has not mi&s;placed this event of <HI>Theudas</HI> above
twelve years; but according to Mr. <HI>Le Clerc,</HI> the er|rour
is greater, for he &s;uppo&s;es he <HI>ro&s;e up</HI> A. D. 28.</P>
<P>BUT this kind of &s;olutions appears to me perfectly
arbitrary, and not to be untying, but cutting the knot.
And I freely own, I have ho right to them. It is very
unlikely, that <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;hould have been mi&s;taken
about the time of <HI>Theudas</HI>'s in&s;urrection, which he
gives an account of. He may have made mi&s;takes in
chronology: but <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> is very expre&s;s here, that
this affair happened in the time of <HI>Fadus;</HI> when he
him&s;elf mu&s;t have been &s;even years of age.</P>
<P>AND in my opinion the&s;e learned men give a wrong
meaning to two expre&s;&s;ions in <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s &s;peech. It is
not nece&s;&s;ary to under&s;tand tho&s;e words, <HI>Before the&s;e
days ro&s;e up Theudas,</HI> of a <HI>little while ago,</HI> two or three
years before. The&s;e common phra&s;es are loo&s;e and
undetermined in all languages, and &s;ignifie &s;ometimes
a &s;horter, at others, a longer &s;pace of time. And the
&s;ubject matter of the di&s;cour&s;e, or the coherence of
things, or &s;ome light from abroad, can alone determine
<PB N="540" REF="558">
what the &s;pace of time intended is. It is &s;aid: <HI>But Saul
increa&s;ed the more in &s;trength, and confounded the Jews
which were at Dama&s;cus.</HI>&mdash;AND AFTER THAT MANY
DAYS <HI>were fulfilled, the Jews took coun&s;el to kill him,</HI>
Acts ix. 22, 23. By the&s;e <HI>many days</HI> can be meant but
a &s;hort &s;pace of time, as appears from <HI>Gal.</HI> i. 17, 18.
St. <HI>Paul</HI> tells <HI>Felix: Fora&s;much as. I know that thou ha&s;t
been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more
chearfully an&s;wer for my&s;elf,</HI> Acts xxiv. 10. Though it
is likely, <HI>Felix</HI> had not then been in <HI>Judea</HI> above five
years. And yet it might be &s;aid very properly, that he
had been there <HI>many years:</HI> &s;ince in five years time, a
Governour may be &s;uppo&s;ed to gain a good in&s;ight into
the laws and cu&s;toms of his province, and the temper
of the people; as al&s;o, becau&s;e very often Governours
were removed in a &s;horter &s;pace of time. When <HI>Pilate</HI>'s
&s;olders had marched into <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> with en&s;igns, the
<HI>Jews</HI> went from thence in a great body to <HI>Pilate</HI> at <HI>Ce|&s;area,</HI>
and there made <HI>&s;upplications, Jo&s;ephus</HI><NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Antiq. 18. cap. 4. &sect; 1.</NOTE> &s;ays,
<HI>many days.</HI> But it appears pre&s;ently afterwards, that
on the<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> $word$</NOTE> <HI>&s;ixth day</HI> from their arrival <HI>Pilate</HI> &s;eated him|&s;elf
on his tribunal, and granted their petition. So <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
relates this in his <HI>Antiquities.</HI> In his <HI>War</HI> the&s;e

<P>THUS the&s;e phra&s;es, that &s;eem to import a long duration,
are much limited by the connexion of a di&s;|cour&s;e,
or by the nature of the things &s;poken of. And
other phra&s;es, that denote ordinarily a &s;horter dura|tion,
mu&s;t be under&s;tood &s;ometimes with great lati|tude.
There is an example in <HI>Jeremiah</HI> ch. xxxi. 31.

<P>I SEE no nece&s;&s;ity therefore of re&s;training the &s;en&s;e
of the phra&s;e, <HI>before the&s;e days,</HI> to two or three years.
It may as well intend twenty or thirty years. It is plain
it does &s;o here, &s;ince it was not till after <HI>Theudas,</HI> that
<HI>Judas</HI> ro&s;e up.</P>
<P>WHICH brings me to the other phra&s;e mi&s;under|&s;tood
by the&s;e learned men: <HI>After this man,</HI><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.
The in&s;tances of the u&s;e of this prepo&s;ition by Geogra|phers
for a remoter di&s;tance are not to the point, be|cau&s;e
here it imports time. And as for <HI>Vale&s;ius</HI>'s quo|tation
from St. <HI>Clement;</HI> I think it not worth while to
con&s;ider here, whether he under&s;tand it aright or not.
At the be&s;t St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s pa&s;&s;age. is very ob&s;eure and
perplexed. St. <HI>Luke's</HI> phra&s;e is one of the mo&s;t com|mon
phra&s;es in all the <HI>Greek</HI> language, and is ever un|der&s;tood
as it is rendered in this place by our tran&s;la|tors.
It would be unrea&s;onable to affix a new mean|ing
to a very common phra&s;e upon the &s;ingle authority
of one ob&s;eure pa&s;&s;age. This is &s;aid upon the &s;uppo&s;i|tion,
that the phra&s;e in St. <HI>Clement</HI> was the &s;ame with
that in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and that the &s;en&s;e a&s;&s;igned by <HI>Vale&s;ius</HI>
to St. <HI>Clement</HI>'s pa&s;&s;age was the mo&s;t likely &s;en&s;e of any.
But indeed the phra&s;e in St. <HI>Clement</HI> is not the &s;ame,
and for that rea&s;on is of the le&s;s weight here.</P>
<P><PB N="542" REF="560">
I SUPPOSE then that our tran&s;lation is ju&s;t, and
that the &s;ub&s;tance of this part of <HI>Gamaliel</HI>'s &s;peech is
this: Not long &s;ince ro&s;e up <HI>Theudas.</HI> It might be
thirty years or more. The per&s;ons he &s;poke to knew
very well how long. And after this man, in the time
of the celebrated a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ement, when <HI>Judea</HI> was made a
Roman province, ro&s;e up <HI>Judas</HI> of <HI>Galilee.</HI> Both

another name. A palace burnt down at <HI>Amatha</HI> by

<P>OR, it is not unlikely, that Critics might have been
divided: Some would hive vindicated <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> and
&s;ome the other writer. And yet they would have been
all mi&s;taken, unle&s;s they had allowed two different bo|dies
of men, and two different matters to be &s;poken of,
and that both the hi&s;torians were in the right.</P>
<P>IT is certain, that the&s;e impo&s;tors about this time
had a re&s;emblance in their preten&s;ions and their fates:
one boa&s;ted he would give his followers a pa&s;&s;age over
<HI>Jordan,</HI> as <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s <HI>Theudas:</HI> another promi&s;ed his
people they &s;hould &s;ee the walls of <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> fall down

this they agreed univer&s;ally, the company was routed
and di&s;per&s;ed; and u&s;ually the leaders executed. This,
we may be certain, was the ca&s;e, or el&s;e the govern|ment
had been overturned.</P>
<P>THESE few circum&s;tances then, in which <HI>Gama|liel</HI>'s

<P>_THERE is yet another particular, in
which it has been thought by &s;ome that
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> contradicts St. <HI>Luke.</HI> In the
xxi. of the <HI>Acts of the Apo&s;tles</HI> is the ac|count
of the <HI>uproar</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> when
the <HI>Jews</HI> apprehended <HI>Paul,</HI> and would
have <HI>killed him.</HI> When the chief captain had taken him
from the <HI>Jews,</HI> and had got him in his own cu&s;tody,
it is &s;aid, he put this que&s;tion to him: <HI>Art not thou that
Egyptian, which before the&s;e days made&s;t an uproar, and
ledde&s;t out into the wilderne&s;&s;e</HI> FOUR THOUSAND <HI>men that
were murderers?</HI> Acts xxi. 38.</P>
<P>THE objection lies again&s;t the number here men|tioned.

&s;ays: he gathered together <HI>thirty thou&s;and men.</HI></P>
<P>WE have the &s;tory twice told in <HI>Jo&s;eephus;</HI> in his
<HI>Antiquities,</HI> and in his Hi&s;tory of the <HI>Jewi&s;h War.</HI> I
&s;hall &s;et down <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s words, and leave it to the
reader to judge, whether an objection of any weight
can be formed again&s;t St. <HI>Luke</HI> from the account we
have of this affair in <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> I &s;hall in the fir&s;t place
tran&s;cribe the account in the <HI>Jewi&s;h War,</HI> becau&s;e that
was fir&s;t writ.</P>
<P>&startq;BUT the <HI>Egyptian</HI> fal&s;e prophet brought a yet
heavier di&s;a&s;ter upon the <HI>Jews.</HI> For this impo&s;tor
coming into the country and gaining the reputation
of a prophet, gathered together thirty thou&s;and men
<PB N="549" REF="567">
who were deceived<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. De Bell. z. c. 13. &sect;. 5.</NOTE> by him. Having brought
them round out of the wilderne&s;&s;e up to the mount
of Olives, he intended from thence to make his at|tack
upon <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and having beaten the Roman
Guard, to bring the people into &s;ubjection to him,
and govern them by the help of his armed a&s;&s;ociates.
But <HI>Felix</HI> coming &s;uddenly upon him with the Ro|man
&s;oldiers, prevented the attack: and all the
people joined with him in their own defen&s;e; &s;o
that, when they came to engage, the <HI>Egyptian</HI> fled,
followed by a few only. A great number [or the
greate&s;t part] of tho&s;e that were with him were either
&s;lain or taken pri&s;oners. The re&s;t of the multitude
being &s;cattered &s;hifted for them&s;elves as they could.&endq;</P>
<P>THE account he gives of this affair in the <HI>Antiqui|ties</HI>
is thus: &startq;About the &s;ame time [<HI>he had been &s;peak|ing
of &s;ome other events in the beginning of Nero's reign</HI>]
there came<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 20. c. 7. &sect;. 6.</NOTE> a per&s;on out of <HI>Egypt</HI> to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI>
who pretended to be a Prophet, and having per|&s;waded
a good number of the meaner &s;ort of people
<PB N="550" REF="568">
to follow him to the Mount of Olives, he told them,
that from thence he would let them &s;ee the walls of
<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> fall down at his command, and promi&s;ed
through them to give them entrance into the City.
But <HI>Felix</HI> being informed of the&s;e things ordered his
&s;oldiers to their arms. And marching out of <HI>Jeru|&s;alem</HI>
with a large body of hor&s;e and foot, fell upon
tho&s;e who were with the <HI>Egyptian:</HI> killed four hun|dred
of them, and took two hundred pri&s;oners. But
the <HI>Egyptian</HI> getting out of the fight, e&s;cap'd.&endq;</P>
<P>THE reader, if he thinks it needful, may con&s;ult
the commentators and other writers, who<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Grot. Whitby in loc. Jo&s;eph. p. 1075. not. p. Vale&s;. in Eu|&s;eb. Hi&s;t. l. ii. c. 21.</NOTE> have
con&s;idered this difficulty. <HI>Grotius</HI> &s;uppo&s;es, that they
were at fir&s;t but <HI>four thou&s;and;</HI> but that at length they
increa&s;ed to the number of <HI>thirty thou&s;and. Vale&s;ius</HI> rec|kons
there were <HI>four tbou&s;and</HI> only that were <HI>murderers</HI>
or <HI>&s;icarii,</HI> tho' the whole company amounted to the
number <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> mentions. Dr. <HI>Whitby</HI> thinks, that it
is likely the number in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was originally <HI>three
thou&s;and.</HI> And certainly none of the&s;e &s;olutions are
contemptible. But, for my own part, I think there
is more need of reconciling <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> with him&s;elf, or at
le&s;t one of the&s;e accounts with the other, than to re|concile
St. <HI>Luke</HI> with <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI></P>
<P>IF indeed we had any good rea&s;on to think, that
the number in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> was originally three thou&s;and,
the di&s;agreement would be &s;mall. The number of a
multitude got together in a &s;hort time, and &s;oon di&s;|per&s;ed,
might not be exactly known: the chief cap|tain
at <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> might compute them at four thou|&s;and,
and <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> think they were but three thou|&s;and.</P>
<P>DR. <HI>Aldrich</HI> has propo&s;ed another very ingenious
conjecture: that originally the number of the whole
company in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>'s <HI>War of the Jews</HI> was four thou|&s;and,
and that the number of <HI>two hundred</HI> &s;aid in the
<PB N="551" REF="569">
<HI>Antiquities</HI> to be taken pri&s;oners was originally <HI>two
thou&s;and:</HI> Both which errors might happen only by a
very &s;mall alteration<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Su&s;picamur interim pro <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> &s;criptum olim <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> permutatis <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, vel etiam &dgr; &amp; &dgr; ex <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> factum e&s;&s;e <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ne dubitamus quidem.

<P>BUT I choo&s;e not to in&s;i&s;t upon any of the&s;e &s;olu|tions,
which rely on emendations made without the
authority of any Manu&s;cripts. The numbers in <HI>Jo|&s;ephus</HI>
are at pre&s;ent plainly faulty. In the fir&s;t ac|count
he &s;ays they were thirty thou&s;and in all, and
that a <HI>great number of the&s;e were either &s;lain or taken
pri&s;oners.</HI> I might have rendered the words, <HI>the mo&s;t
of them,</HI> or <HI>the greate&s;t part of them.</HI> But though I
have not given them that &s;en&s;e, yet certainly the <HI>four
hundred &s;lain</HI> and <HI>two hundred taken pri&s;oners,</HI> in the
other account, cannot be reckoned a <HI>great number</HI> or
a <HI>large part</HI> of thirty thou&s;and.</P>
<P>BUT then, as I do not in&s;i&s;t on the&s;e conjectural
emendations for reconciling <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> with St. <HI>Luke;</HI>
&s;o, on the other hand, it would be very unfair, fir&s;t;
to take it for granted that the number of thirty thou|&s;and
in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> is right; and then arbitrarily to re|form
all the other numbers in him, in order to form
an objection again&s;t the <HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI></P>
<P>I THINK, therefore there can be no objection
brought again&s;t the numbers in St. <HI>Luke</HI> from what
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has &s;aid of this affair, becau&s;e his two ac|counts
are not con&s;i&s;tent one with another in this
point: And that is &s;ufficient.</P>
<P>THESE were my thoughts concerning this difficul|ty
formerly. But I have now an ob&s;ervation to offer
to the reader, which I think will not only reconcile
St. <HI>Luke</HI> with <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> but likewi&s;e <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> with him|&s;elf;
and that without making any alterations in his
numbers. This ob&s;ervation has been communicated to

THE hi&s;tory of this impo&s;tor &s;eems to lye thus.
H$ $ome fir&s;t to <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> went from thence into
the country, and taking a circuit by the wilderne&s;s re|turned
again to the mount of <HI>Olives.</HI> In the <HI>Antiquities</HI>

and at la&s;t to the mount of <HI>Olives;</HI> and drops the
middle part, of which he had given a &s;ufficient ac|count
in the books of the <HI>War.</HI> The chief captain's
<HI>four thou&s;and</HI> therefore were the men carried out of <HI>Je|ru&s;alem,</HI>
who were afterwards<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">The words <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in St. <HI>Luke,</HI> and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> in <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> &s;eem very well adapted to this di&s;tinction.</NOTE> joined by others in
the country to the number of <HI>thirty thou&s;and,</HI> as related
by <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI>'Tis likely al&s;o, that before he left the
city, he had &s;o concerted matters with &s;ome friends,
whom he left behind him, as to entertain hopes, that
upon his return his de&s;ign would be favoured by great
numbers of <HI>Jews</HI> in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and that he &s;hould
have no oppo&s;ition from any but the <HI>Romans.</HI> But up|on
his arrival at the mount of <HI>Olives,</HI> finding the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
drawn out to attack him, and the citizens in
general prepared to oppo&s;e him, he did not dare to
venture an engagement, but pre&s;ently fled with a
body of his mo&s;t: tru&s;tly friends, as is u&s;ual in &s;uch
ca&s;es. With the&s;e in particular the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;oldiers
were ordered to engage, neglecting the re&s;t, who
were only a confu&s;ed multitude, and immediately
made off as they could by different wayes. When
therefore <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, <HI>the Egyptian fled accompanied by
a few</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE> <HI>only,</HI> he is to be under&s;tood of that body

the number of the &s;lain and the pri&s;oners is no greater;
&s;ince, as it &s;eems, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;peaks only of that body
of men who fled with the impo&s;tor. 'Tis po&s;&s;ible,
&s;ome of the re&s;t of the multitude might be killed like|wi&s;e,
though <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> takes no notice of them; but
'tis mo&s;t likely not many. For it &s;eems by <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI>
as if only the <HI>Roman</HI> &s;oldiers marched out again&s;t them,
while the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people in <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> &s;tood upon their
defence, if any on&s;et had been made upon them.</P>
<P>THUS then, though there were but <HI>four thou&s;and</HI> of
the&s;e men at fir&s;t, they might be joined by others af|terwards
to the number of <HI>thirty thou&s;and.</HI> So St. <HI>Luke</HI>
is reconciled with <HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI> And the number, &s;aid by
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> to be <HI>&s;lain or taken pri&s;oners,</HI> might be a <HI>great
number,</HI> or the <HI>greate&s;t part,</HI> of that body which fled
with the <HI>Egyptian</HI> upon the attack made by <HI>Felix</HI> and
his &s;oldiers Thus <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> is reconciled with him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>BUT yet I cannot leave the Hi&s;tory <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has
given us of this <HI>Egyptian,</HI> without making two or
three ob&s;ervations.</P>
<P>1. THE chief captain here a&s;ks St. <HI>Paul: Art not
thou that Egyptian which</HI><NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">'O' <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">.</NOTE> LEDDEST OUT <HI>into the wil|derne&s;&s;e?</HI>
&mdash;which &s;eems to imply, &s;ince the que&s;tion
was a&s;ked in <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> that the&s;e men, or a good
number of them at le&s;t, were drawn out of <HI>Jeru&s;alem:</HI>
And <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays expre&s;ly in the later account,
that this impo&s;tor came <HI>out of Egypt to Jeru&s;alem; and
per&s;waded a good number of the meaner &s;ort of people, (i. e.</HI>
who were there) to <HI>follow him.</HI></P>
<P>2. THE chief captain &s;peaks of their being <HI>led out
into the</HI> WILDERNESSE. This circum&s;tance <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has
mentioned in the fir&s;t account, where he more particu|larly
relates their march, and the compa&s;&s;e they took,
than in the other.</P>
<P><PB N="554" REF="572">
3. THIS <HI>Egyptian</HI> e&s;caped. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has put down
this in both places, and undoubtedly this is &s;uppo&s;ed in
the que&s;tion put to St. <HI>Paul</HI> by the chief captain. The
agreement in this particular de&s;erves to be taken notice
of, becau&s;e it was the common fate of the&s;e impo|&s;tors
to peri&s;h them&s;elves with a good number of
their followers.</P>
<P>4. THIS <HI>Egyptian</HI> cau&s;ed this di&s;turbance, accord|ing
to <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> when <HI>Felix</HI> was Governour of <HI>Judea.</HI>
This impo&s;tor therefore did not ari&s;e any long time
before the &s;ei&s;ure of St. <HI>Paul</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem.</HI> He might
be &s;till living therefore: In this re&s;pect there was no
ab&s;urdity in this que&s;tion of the chief captain.</P>
<P>5. ANOTHER particular, which we are obliged to
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> for, is, <HI>that all the people (&s;c.</HI> at <HI>Jeru&s;alem)</HI>
favoured, or joined with <HI>Felix,</HI> upon this occa&s;ion, in
their own defen&s;e: That is, all but &s;ome very mean
people. If <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> had not mentioned this, perhaps
it would have been &s;aid: Since con&s;iderable numbers
u&s;ually joined the&s;e impo&s;tors, and it is likely more
favoured them; how was it po&s;&s;ible, that the chief
captain &s;hould a&s;k <HI>Paul,</HI> when he &s;aw the whole city
was in an uproar, and the people were ready to tear
him to pieces: <HI>Art not thou that Egyptian?</HI> that pre|tended
prophet, that <HI>before the&s;e days</HI> made&s;t <HI>an up|roar?</HI>
a man of a favourite character at this time
among the <HI>Jews!</HI></P>
<P>I THINK indeed, that if <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> had omitted this
circum&s;tance, it would have been a very good reply, to
&s;ay, that the chief captain did not yet know what was
the matter: And though there was a loud cry in the
multitude, of <HI>away with him;</HI> yet the confu&s;ion was
&s;uch, <HI>&s;ome &s;aying one thing,</HI> and <HI>&s;ome another,</HI> that the
chief captain had yet no notion what the ca&s;e was.
However we have no occa&s;ion to have recour&s;e to this
reply. <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has told us, that all the people fa|voured
<HI>Felix</HI> in his enterprize again&s;t this man: whe|ther
it was becau&s;e he came from <HI>Egypt,</HI> or what was
the rea&s;on, is of no importance.</P>
<P><PB N="555" REF="573">
6. THERE is a remarkable agreement between the
chief captain in the <HI>Acts</HI> and <HI>Jo&s;ephus,</HI> in the de&s;crip|tion
they give of this man. The chief captain &s;ays:
<HI>Art not thou that Egyptian?</HI> And it is obf&s;ervable, that
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has not mentioned this man's name in either
of the accounts. In the fir&s;t he calls him the <HI>Egyp|tian
fal&s;e prophet,</HI> and <HI>the Egyptian.</HI> In the other, he
&s;ays, <HI>there came one</HI> (or a certain per&s;on) out of <HI>Egypt:</HI>
And again, <HI>Felix</HI> fell upon tho&s;e who were <HI>with the
Egyptian:</HI> But the <HI>Egyptian</HI> e&s;caped.</P>
<P>WE have then in the <HI>Acts</HI> the exact manner, in
which the <HI>Jews</HI> about this time &s;poke of this impo|&s;tor.
This is with me a proof, that St. <HI>Luke</HI> lived and
wrote about this time: that is, at the time he is &s;uppo|&s;ed
to write. We have here undoubtedly the chief
captain's que&s;tion in the very words in which it was
put. St. <HI>Luke</HI> mu&s;t have received this account from
St. <HI>Paul,</HI> or &s;ome one el&s;e who was pre&s;ent, if he was
not by him&s;elf.</P>
<P>I HOPE therefore, that the account, which <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
has given of this impo&s;tor will be no longer reckon'd
an objection again&s;t St. <HI>Luke,</HI> but a confirmation of
his hi&s;tory.</P>

<HEAD>THE

<P>_I HAVE now performed what I under|took,
and have &s;hewn, that the account
given by the Sacred Writers of per&s;ons
and things is confirmed by other anci|ent
Authors of the be&s;t note. There is
nothing in the books of the <HI>New Te|&s;tament</HI>
un&s;uitable to the age, in which
they are &s;uppo&s;ed to have been writ. There appears
in the&s;e Writers a knowledge of the affairs of tho&s;e
times not to be found in authors of later ages. <HI>We are
$$reby a&s;&s;ured, that the books of the New Te&s;tament are
$Word$, and that they were writ by per&s;ons who lived at
or near the time of tho&s;e events, of which they have given
the hi&s;tory.</HI></P>
<P>ANY one may be &s;en&s;ible, how hard it is for the
mo&s;t learned, acute, and cautious man, to write a
book in the character of &s;ome per&s;on of an earlier
age; and not betray his own time by &s;ome mi&s;take
about the affairs of the age in which he pretends to
place him&s;elf, or by allu&s;ions to cu&s;toms or princi|ples
&s;ince &s;prung up, or by &s;ome phra&s;e or expre&s;|&s;ion
not then in u&s;e. It is no ea&s;y thing to e&s;cape
<PB N="557" REF="575">
all the&s;e dangers in the &s;malle&s;t performance, though
it be a treati&s;e of theory or &s;peculation. The&s;e ha|zards
are greatly encrea&s;ed, when the work is of any
length, and e&s;pecially if it be hi&s;torical, and be con|cerned
with characters and cu&s;toms. It is yet more
difficult to carry on &s;uch a de&s;ign in a work con|&s;i&s;ting
of &s;everal pieces, writ to all appearance by &s;e|veral
per&s;ons. Many indeed are de&s;irous to deceive,
but all hate to be deceived. And therefore, though
attempts have been made to impo&s;e upon the world
in this way, they have never or very rarely &s;uc|ceeded,
but have been detected and expo&s;ed by the
&s;kill and vigilance of tho&s;e who have been concerned
for the truth.</P>
<P>THE Volume of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> con&s;i&s;ts of
&s;everal pieces. The&s;e are a&s;cribed to eight &s;everal
per&s;ons. And there are the &s;tronge&s;t appearances,
that they were not all writ by any one hand, but
by as many per&s;ons as they are a&s;cribed to. There
are le&s;&s;er differences in the relations of &s;ome facts,
and &s;uch &s;eeming contradictions as would never have
happened, if the&s;e books had been all the work of
one per&s;on, or of &s;everal who writ in concert. There
are as many peculiarities of temper and &s;tile, as there
are names of writers: divers of which &s;hew no depth
of Genius, or compa&s;&s;e of knowledge. Here are re|pre&s;entations
of the titles, po&s;ts, behaviour of per&s;ons
of higher and lower rank in many parts of the world.
Per&s;ons are introduced, and their characters are &s;et in
a full light. Here is a hi&s;tory of things done in &s;eve|ral
cities and countries; and there are allu&s;ions to a
va&s;t variety of cu&s;toms and tenets of per&s;ons of &s;eve|ral
nations, &s;ects, and religions. The whole is writ
without affectation, with the greate&s;t &s;implicity and
plainne&s;&s;e, and is confirmed by other ancient writers
of unque&s;tioned. authority</P>
<P>IF it be difficult for a per&s;on of learning and ex|perience
to compo&s;e a &s;mall treati&s;e, concerning mat|ters
<PB N="558" REF="576">
of &s;peculation, with the characters of a more
early age than that in which he writes; it is next to
impo&s;&s;ible, that &s;uch a work of con&s;iderable length,
con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal pieces, with a great variety of
hi&s;torical facts, repre&s;entations of characters, princi|ples,
and cu&s;toms of &s;everal nations and di&s;tant coun|tries,
of per&s;ons of all ranks and degrees, of many
intere&s;ts and parties, &s;hould be performed by eight
&s;evral per&s;ons, the mo&s;t of them unlearned, without
any appearance of concert.</P>
<P>I MIGHT perhaps have called this argument a de|mon&s;tration,
if that term had not been often mi&s;ap|plied
by men of warm imaginations, and been be|&s;towed
upon rea&s;onings that have but a &s;mall degree
of probability. But though it &s;hould not be a &s;trict
demon&s;tration, that the&s;e writings are genuine: or tho'
it be not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible in the nature of the
thing, that the books of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> &s;hould
have been compo&s;ed in a later age than that to which
they are a&s;&s;igned, and of which they have innumera|ble
character; yet, I think, it is in the highe&s;t de|gree
improbable, and altogether incredible.</P>
<P><HI>IF the books of the New Te&s;tiament were writ by per|&s;ons
who lived, before the de&s;truction of Jeru&s;alem, that is,
if they were writ at the time in which they are &s;aid to
have been writ, the things related in them are true.</HI> If
they had not been matter of fact, they would not have
been credited by any per&s;ons near that time, and in
tho&s;e parts of the world in which they are &s;aid to
have been done, but would have been treated as the
mo&s;t notorious lies and fal&s;hoods. Suppo&s;e three or
four books &s;hould now appear among&s;t us in the lan|guage
mo&s;t generally under&s;tood, giving an account
of many remarkable and extraordinary events which
had happened in &s;ome kingdome of <HI>Europe,</HI> and in
the mo&s;t noted cities of the countries next adjoining to
it; &s;ome of them &s;aid to have happened between &s;ixty
and &s;eventy years ago, others between twenty and
<PB N="559" REF="577">
thirty, others nearer our own time: Would not they
be looked upon as the mo&s;t manife&s;t and ridiculous
forgeries and impo&s;tures that ever were contrived?
Would great numbers of per&s;ons, in tho&s;e very places,
change their religious principles and practi&s;es upon the
credit of things reported to be publickly done, which
no man had ever heard of before? Or rather, is it
po&s;lible that &s;uch a de&s;ign as this &s;hould be conceived
by any &s;ober and &s;erious per&s;ons, or even the mo&s;t
wild and extravagant?</P>
<P><HI>IF the hi&s;tiory of the New Te&s;tament be credible, the
Chri&s;tian Religion is true.</HI> If the things here related co
have been done by Je&s;us, and by his followers, by vir|tue
of powers derived from him, do not prove a per&s;on
to come from God, and that his doctrine is true and
divine, nothing can. And as Je&s;us does here in the
circum&s;tances of his birth, life, &s;ufferings, and after
exaltation, and in the &s;ucce&s;&s;e of his doctrine, an&s;wer
the de&s;cription of the great per&s;on promi&s;ed and fore|told
in the <HI>Old Te&s;tiament,</HI> he is at the &s;ame time &s;hew|ed
to be the Me&s;&s;iah.</P>
<P><HI>FROM the agreement of the writers of the New
Te&s;tament with other ancient writers we are not only a&s;|&s;ured
that the&s;e books are genuine, but al&s;o that they are

interpolations or alterations.</HI> If &s;uch had been
made in them, there would have appeared &s;ome &s;mal|ler
differences at le&s;t between them and other ancient

<P>THERE has been in all ages a wicked propen&s;ity
in mankind to advance their own notions and fan&s;ies
by deceits and forgeries. They have been practi&s;ed
by <HI>Heathens, Jews,</HI> and <HI>Chri&s;tians,</HI> in &s;upport of ima|ginary
hi&s;torical facts, religious &s;chemes and practi&s;es,
and political intere&s;ts. With the&s;e views &s;ome whole
books have been forged, and pa&s;&s;ages in&s;erted into
others of undoubted authority. Many of the Chri|&s;tian
writers of the &s;econd and third centuries, and of
<PB N="560" REF="578">
the following ages, appear to have had fal&s;e notions
concerning the &s;tate of <HI>Judea</HI> between the nativity of
Je&s;us and the de&s;truction of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> and concern|ing
many other things occasionally mentioned in the
<HI>New Te&s;tament.</HI> The con&s;ent of the be&s;t ancient wri|ters
with tho&s;e of the <HI>New Te&s;tament</HI> is a proof, that
the&s;e books are &s;till untouched, and that they have
not been new modelled and altered by Chri&s;tians of
later times in conformity to their own peculiar &s;en|timents.</P>
<P>THIS may be reckoned an argument, that the
generality of Chri&s;tians have had a very high vene|ration
for the&s;e books or el&s;e, that the &s;everal &s;ects
among them have had an eye upon each other, that
no alterations might be made in tho&s;e writings, to
which they have all appealed. It is al&s;o an argument,
that the Divine Providence has all along watched over
and guarded the&s;e be&s;t of books (a very fit object of
an e&s;pecial care) which contain the be&s;t of princi|ples,
were apparently writ with the be&s;t views, and
have in them inimitable characters of truth and &s;im|plicity.</P>

<HEAD>AN
APPENDIX
Concerning the time of Herod's
death,</HEAD>
<P>_IN all enquiries concerning the
chronology of the <HI>New Te&s;tament,</HI>
and particularly concerning the
true time of our Saviour's nativi|ty,
and the commencement of his
mini&s;try, it is very needful to
take into con&s;ideration the time
of <HI>Herod</HI> the Great's death. In|deed
it is very de&s;irable in the fir&s;t place to &s;ettle
exactly the date of this event. But to do this is a
very hard ta&s;k. Nor has any one yet been &s;o happy,
as to remove all difficulties, and give univer&s;al &s;ati&s;|faction
upon this head.</P>
<P>THAT none may be quite at a lo&s;&s;e in judging
of the difficulty con&s;idered in the <HI>third</HI> chapter of
this Book, I &s;hall here give a brief account of this
matter.</P>
<P><PB N="562" REF="580">
THE chief opinions at pre&s;ent concerning the time
of <HI>Herod's</HI> death are the&s;e three. Some think he died
a little before the pa&s;&s;over of A. U. 750, <HI>Julian</HI>
year 42. others, on <HI>Novemb.</HI> 25, that &s;ame year:
others, a &s;hort time before the Pa&s;&s;over, A. U.
751.</P>
<P>&sect;. I. THE <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> reader may &s;ee all, in a man|ner,
that can be &s;aid for the &s;econd opinion, in
Mr. <HI>Whi&s;ton's &s;hort View of the Harmony of the four
Evangeli&s;ts, Prop.</HI> 12. But, though &s;everal very
learned men have embraced this opinion, it appears
to me a meer hypothe&s;is without foundation. The
only ground of it is a <HI>Jew&s;ih</HI> account of their Fea&s;ts
and Fa&s;ts, in which that day is noted as a Fea&s;t, be|cau&s;e
on it <HI>Herod</HI> died. But<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">See <HI>With.</HI> Annotat. <HI>Matth.</HI> ii. 23. <HI>Lany</HI> Apparat. Chronol. Par. i. cap. 9. &sect;. 3.</NOTE> this book appears to
be of no authority.</P>
<P>&sect;. II. THAT <HI>Herod</HI> died but a &s;hort time before
&s;ome one of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Pa&s;&s;overs, is evident from
<HI>Jo&s;ephus.</HI><NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">De Bell. l. 2. c. 1. Antiq. 17. c. 9.</NOTE> If we reject entirely his authority, it
is in vain to talk about the time of <HI>Herod's</HI> death.
<HI>Archelaus</HI> kept a Pa&s;&s;over in <HI>Judea</HI> after his father's
death, before he went to <HI>Rome;</HI> which he would
not have done, if it had not been near. He had
good rea&s;on to ha&s;ten to <HI>Rome.</HI> He had many ene|mies.
<HI>Herod Antipas</HI> had been appointed his father's
&s;ucce&s;&s;or in a former Will, and he pretended that
Will ought to take place. When the <HI>Jews</HI> at the
temple made their demands of <HI>Archelaus,</HI> he gave
them fair words, that they might not make any di|&s;turbance
and retard his journey<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">. Antiq. 17. c. 9. &sect;. 1.</NOTE>, he being in ha&s;t
<PB N="563" REF="581">
to go to <HI>Rome.</HI> This ha&s;t is expre&s;&s;ed by <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI>
in the <HI>War,</HI> and in the <HI>Antiquities</HI> in very &s;trong
terms. <HI>Archelaus,</HI> in his way to <HI>Rome,</HI> at <HI>Ce&s;area,</HI>
met <HI>Sabinus,</HI> the Emperour's Procurator in <HI>Syria,</HI>
who was going<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Antiq. ibid. &sect;. 3. vid. &amp; De Bell. ibid. c. 2. &sect;. 2.</NOTE> in all ha&s;t to <HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> to &s;ecure
<HI>Herod's</HI> trea&s;ure for <HI>Augu&s;tus.</HI> By help of the in|terce&s;&s;ions
of <HI>Varus,</HI> pre&s;ident of <HI>Syria</HI> (who was
then likewi&s;e at <HI>Ce&s;area) Archelaus</HI> prevailed upon
<HI>Sabinus</HI> to promi&s;e, that he would not proceed any
farther. But notwith&s;tanding that, when <HI>Archelaus</HI>
was gone away, he went up to <HI>Jeru&s;alem;</HI> and there
ordered all things, according to his own will and
plea&s;ure. This was all managed without any orders
from <HI>Rome.</HI> If <HI>Herod</HI> had been dead two or three
months, they would have had directions from thence
upon this matter. Nay, if <HI>Herod</HI> had been dead one
month, this vigilant Procurator would have been at
<HI>Jeru&s;alem</HI> before now. I take this to be a kind of
demon&s;tration, that, according to <HI>Jo&s;ephus, Herod</HI>'s
death happened but a very &s;hort &s;pace before &s;ome
Pa&s;&s;over.</P>
<P>&sect;. III. THAT <HI>Herod</HI> died a little before the Pa&s;&s;o|ver
A. U. 750, <HI>Julian</HI> year 42, is argued in this
manner. His di&s;temper had made great progre&s;&s;e
before the pulling down the Golden Eagle at the
Temple. The <HI>Jewi&s;h Rabbies</HI> excited their &s;cholars
to this action, <HI>News being brought that Herod</HI><NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> De Bell. 1. c. 33. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> <HI>was</HI>
DYING, as it is in the <HI>War;</HI><NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">Antiq. 17. c. 6. &sect;. 3.</NOTE> DEAD, as it is in
the <HI>Antiquities.</HI> The&s;e Rabbies were taken up and
carried to <HI>Jericho,</HI> where <HI>Herod</HI> was. A council was
<PB N="564" REF="582">
called, and they were tried. <HI>Herod</HI> was &s;o ill that
he could not &s;tand, and notwithstanding the new
&s;trength<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> De Bell. 1. c. 33. &sect;. 4.</NOTE> which rage gave him upon this occa&s;i|on,
he was carried<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. ibid.</NOTE> to the council in a chair. Soon
after this the&s;e Rabbies were burnt to death, and that
very<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> ibid. &sect;. 4.</NOTE> night there was an eclip&s;e of the moon.
This eclip&s;e, according to a&s;tronomical computations,
happened<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Petav. Doctrin. Temp. l. xi. c. 1.</NOTE> the 13th of <HI>March,</HI> A. U. 750. Af|ter
this, <HI>Herod</HI> grew wor&s;e and wor&s;e. It is plain,
he could not live long. The Pa&s;&s;over<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Vid. Lamy App. Chron. p. 58.</NOTE> of this
year happened the 11th of <HI>April.</HI> From the 13th
of <HI>March</HI> to the 11th of <HI>April</HI> is a &s;ufficient &s;pace of

reign could not be compleated in the 759th year of

beginning, of A. U. 750, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> and <HI>Dio</HI> agree.
Moreover, <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> &s;ays, that<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> Antiq. l. 18. c. 2. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Cyrenius</HI> &s;ei&s;ed <HI>Ar|chelaus</HI>'s

in the <HI>thirty &s;eventh year after the defeat of An|tony
at Actium by Ce&s;ar Augu&s;tus.</HI> The victory at
<HI>Actium</HI> was obtained the 2d. <HI>Septemb.</HI> A. U. 723.
Therefore the 37th year from it begins 2d. <HI>Septemb.</HI>
A. U. 759, and ends 2d. <HI>Sept.</HI> 760. Suppo&s;ing then,
that <HI>Herod</HI> died the beginning of A. U. 750, there is
in this particular al&s;o a very good harmony between
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> and <HI>Dio.</HI></P>
<P>THERE is however one great difficulty attending
this opinion. For <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> has &s;aid in two places,
that <HI>Herod</HI> reigned <HI>thirty four years</HI> after the death
of<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN"> de B. J. l. 1. c. ult. &sect;. 8. vid. &amp;. Antiq. 17. c. 8. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> <HI>Antigonus;</HI> and <HI>thirty &s;even years</HI> after he was

death of<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">Antiq. 14. c. ult. &sect;. 4.</NOTE> <HI>Antigonus</HI> in the year 717. If indeed at
the beginning of A. U. 750, <HI>Herod</HI> had reigned
thirty &s;ix years compleat from the fir&s;t date of his
reign, and thirty three from the later; &s;o that the
37th of the one epocha, and the 34th of the o|ther
<PB N="566" REF="584">
$word$e to be current at the time of his death;
then <HI>Herod</HI> might be &s;aid not improperly to have

and to the other, thirty four. It is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome
learned men that <HI>Herod</HI> was declared king by the Se|nate,

then, at the beginning of the year 750, <HI>Herod</HI> could
not have reigned from this date thirty &s;ix years com|pleat,
nor was the 37th year current. <HI>Herod</HI> took

followed, then from this date of <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign, <HI>viz.</HI>
the taking of <HI>Jeru&s;alem,</HI> or the death of <HI>Antigonus</HI>
(which are all one) to the beginning of the year 750,
we have not quite thirty three years compleat, nor is
the thirty fourth current.</P>
<P>IN an&s;wer to this difficulty it is &s;aid<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Inde etiam anni regum Hebraeorum &s;upputabantur, ita ut &s;i ouis Rex in Adar regnaret, a Ni&s;an alter annus imperii ejus inciperet.

<P>&sect;. IV. OTHER<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vid. Lamy Appar. Chron. Par. i. c. ix. Ba&s;nage Annal. Pol. Eccl. Vol. i. p. 156. n. v.</NOTE> learned men &s;uppo&s;e that <HI>He|rod</HI>
died a &s;hort time before the Pa&s;&s;over A. U. 751.
This they argue from the number of years a&s;&s;igned
to <HI>Herod</HI>'s reign in the places above mentioned.
They do not allow the truth of the <HI>Talmudical</HI> ac|count
of computing the Reigns of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Kings
from the beginning of <HI>Ni&s;an,</HI> or from the Pa&s;&s;over.
If <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> had followed &s;uch a kind of computation,
he would have given &s;ome hint of it in his books
writ in the <HI>Greek</HI> language and for the in&s;truction of
&s;trangers. They &s;ay al&s;o, that <HI>Herod</HI>'s was a &s;low
lingring di&s;temper and that it is not likely he &s;hould
die &s;o &s;oon after the execution of the Rabbies and
their accomplices, as is &s;uppo&s;ed by the Patrons of
the former opinion. La&s;tly, they ob&s;erve the<NOTE N="A" PLACE="foot"><HI>Note,</HI> the learned men, who e&s;pou&s;e the former opinion, &s;up|po&s;e al&s;o that <HI>Jo&s;ephu&s;</HI>'s numbers in all other places agree with them.</NOTE>
<PB N="568" REF="586">
agreement of all the other numbers in <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> con|cerning
the dates of the reign of <HI>Archelaus</HI> and other
&s;ons of <HI>Herod.</HI></P>
<P>THIS opinion however labours under &s;everal very
great difficulties. <HI>Dio</HI>'s account of the removal of
<HI>Archelaus</HI> is entirely rejected. But to do this<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Vid. Nori&s;. Cenot. Pi&s;. p. 147.</NOTE> is
not very rea&s;onable. Farther, the &s;upporters of this
opinion mu&s;t allow of the eclip&s;e abovementioned; or
they mu&s;t &s;ay it was no real eclip&s;e, but only &s;ome
ob&s;curity that was taken for an eclip&s;e. If they al|low
the eclip&s;e, then <HI>Herod</HI> mu&s;t have lived a year
after the execution of the Rabbies, provided he
died<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Quae aptis temporibus tribui non po&s;&s;unt, ni&s;i haec mors contigerit jam aliquibus men&s;ibus promoto Anno U.

Lamy ubi &s;upra. &sect;.</NOTE> but a few days before the Pa&s;&s;over, A. U.
751. But it is incredible that <HI>Herod</HI> &s;hould live &s;o
long, con&s;idering the de&s;cription <HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> gives of his
di&s;temper. Be&s;ides, it is evident that the mourning
of the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> people for the Rabbies, at the Pa&s;&s;o|ver
next after <HI>Herod</HI>'s death, was<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot"><GAP DESC="FOREIGN">De B. 2. c. 1. &sect;. 2. vid. &amp; Antiq. 17. c. 9. &sect;. 1.</NOTE> very fre&s;h, which
it could not have been, if the Rabbies had been dead
above a year before. Moreover, it is evident, that
<HI>Herod</HI>'s amba&s;&s;adors were &s;ent away to <HI>Rome</HI> to know
<HI>Augu&s;tus</HI>'s plea&s;ure concerning <HI>Antipater,</HI> &s;ome<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">De B. 1. c. 32. fin. Antiq. 17. C. 5. fin.</NOTE>
time before the di&s;turbance at the Temple, when the
Golden Eagle was taken down. And it is very plain,
that <HI>Herod</HI> lived not<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">De B. ibid. c. 33. &sect;. 7, 8. Antiq. ibid. c. 7. &amp; c. 8.&sect; 1.</NOTE> many days after the arrival
of the amba&s;&s;adors. So that according to this opinion
the&s;e amba&s;&s;adors mu&s;t have &s;pent above a year in
their journey from <HI>Judea</HI> to <HI>Rome</HI> and back again,
<PB N="569" REF="587">
though they were &s;ent upon very pre&s;&s;ing bu&s;ine&s;&s;e,
which is al&s;o incredible. Or they mu&s;t reject the ac|count
of the eclip&s;e and &s;ay, as Father <HI>Lamy</HI><NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Ubi &s;upra, $. 6.</NOTE> does,
that it was only a palene&s;&s;e or ob&s;curity which was no
real eclip&s;e of the Moon; which, I believe, will ap|pear
very unrea&s;onable to all A&s;tronomers.</P>
<P>THESE are the three principal opinions concerning
the time of <HI>Herod</HI>'s death. And the&s;e the main argu|ments
for, and objections again&s;t them. I pre&s;ume it
appears to the reader from particulars alledged from
<HI>Jo&s;ephus</HI> and <HI>Dio,</HI> That <HI>Herod</HI> did not die before the
year 750, nor &s;urvive the year 751: And that he
died a &s;hort time before the <HI>Jewi&s;h</HI> Pa&s;&s;over, of one
of the&s;e years. It follows, that if <HI>Herod</HI> died in 750,
he died three years and nine months before the Vul|gar
Chri&s;tian AEra, which commences <HI>January</HI> 1,
A. U. 754: If at the time abovementioned in the
year 751, then he died about two years and nine
months before the &s;aid AEra, Which is the truth, I
dare not determine.</P>
