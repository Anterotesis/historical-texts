<HEAD>THE
ITALIAN,
OR THE
CONFESSIONAL of the BLACK PENITENTS.</HEAD>
<P>ABOUT the year 1764, &s;ome Engli&s;h
travellers in Italy, during one of their ex|cur&s;ions
in the environs of Naples, happen|ed
to &s;top before the portico of the <HI>Santa
Maria del Pianto,</HI> a church belonging to
a very ancient convent of the order of the
<HI>Black Penitents.</HI> The magnificence of this
portico, though impaired by time, excited
&s;o much admiration, that the travellers
were curious to &s;urvey the &s;tructure to
which it belonged, and with this intention
they a&s;cended the marble &s;teps that led to
it.</P>
<P><PB N="iv" REF="3">
Within the &s;hade of the portico, a per&s;on
with folded arms, and eyes directed to|wards
the ground, was pacing behind the
pillars the whole extent of the pavement,
and was apparently &s;o engaged by his own
thoughts, as not to ob&s;erve that &s;trangers
were approaching. He turned, however,
&s;uddenly, as if &s;tartled by the &s;ound of
&s;teps, and then, without further pau&s;ing,
glided to a door that opened into the
church, and di&s;appeared.</P>
<P>There was &s;omething too extraordinary
in the figure of this man, and too &s;ingular
in his conduct, to pa&s;s unnoticed by the
vi&s;itors. He was of a tall thin figure,
bending forward from the &s;houlders; of a
&s;allow complexion, and har&s;h features, and
had an eye, which, as it looked up from
the cloke that muffled the lower part of his
countenance, &s;eemed expre&s;&s;ive of uncom|mon
ferocity.</P>
<P>The travellers, on entering the church,
looked round for the &s;tranger, who had
<PB N="v" REF="4" MS="Y">
pa&s;&s;ed thither before them, but he was no
where to be &s;een, and, through all the &s;hade
of the long ai&s;les, only one other per&s;on ap|peared.
This was a friar of the adjoining con|vent,
who &s;ometimes pointed out to &s;trangers
the objects in the church, which were mo&s;t
worthy of attention, and who now, with this
de&s;ign, approached the party that had ju&s;t
entered.</P>
<P>The interior of this edifice had nothing
of the &s;hewy ornament and general &s;plen|dor,
which di&s;tingui&s;h the churches of
Italy, and particularly tho&s;e of Naples; but
it exhibited a &s;implicity and grandeur of
de&s;ign, con&s;iderably more intere&s;ting to
per&s;ons of ta&s;te, and a &s;olemnity of light
and &s;hade much more &s;uitable to promote
the &s;ublime elevation of devotion.</P>
<P>When the party had viewed the different
&s;hrines and whatever had been judged
worthy of ob&s;ervation, and were returning
through an ob&s;cure ai&s;le towards the por|tico,
they perceived the per&s;on who had
<PB N="vi" REF="5">
appeared upon the &s;teps, pa&s;&s;ing towards
a confe&s;&s;ional on the left, and, as he entered
it, one of the party pointed him out to the
friar, and enquired who he was; the friar
turning to look after him, did not imme|diately
reply, but, on the que&s;tion being
repeated, he inclined his head, as in a kind
of obei&s;ance, and calmly replied, &startq;He is
an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;An a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in!&endq; exclaimed one of the
Engli&s;hmen; &startq;an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in and at liberty!&endq;</P>
<P>An Italian gentleman, who was of the
party, &s;miled at the a&s;toni&s;hment of his
friend.</P>
<P>&startq;He has &s;ought &s;anctuary here,&endq; re|plied
the friar; &startq;within the&s;e walls he may
not be hurt.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do your altars, then, protect the mur|derer?&endq;
&s;aid the Engli&s;hman.</P>
<P>&startq;He could find &s;helter no where el&s;e,&endq;
an&s;wered the friar meekly.</P>
<P>&startq;This is a&s;toni&s;hing!&endq; &s;aid the Eng|lishman;
&startq;of what avail are your laws,
<PB N="vii" REF="6">
if the mo&s;t atrocious criminal may thus
find &s;helter from them? But how does he
contrive to exi&s;t here! He is, at lea&s;t, in
danger of being &s;tarved?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pardon me,&endq; replied the friar; &startq;there
are always people willing to a&s;&s;i&s;t tho&s;e,
who cannot a&s;&s;i&s;t them&s;elves; and as the
criminal may not leave the church in
&s;earch of food, they bring it to him
here.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is this po&s;&s;ible!&endq; &s;aid the Engli&s;hman,
turning to his Italian friend.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, the poor wretch mu&s;t not
&s;tarve,&endq; replied the friend; &startq;which he
inevitably would do, if food were not
brought to him! But have you never,
&s;ince your arrival in Italy, happened to &s;ee
a per&s;on in the &s;ituation of this man?
It is by no means an uncommon one.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Never!&endq; an&s;wered the Engli&s;hman,
&startq;and I can &s;carcely credit what I &s;ee
now!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="vii" REF="7">
&startq;Why, my friend,&endq; ob&s;erved the Ita|lian,
&startq;if we were to &s;hew no mercy to
&s;uch unfortunate per&s;ons, a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations are
&s;o frequent, that our cities would be half
depopulated.&endq;</P>
<P>In notice of this profound remark, the
Engli&s;hman could only gravely bow.</P>
<P>&startq;But ob&s;erve yonder confe&s;&s;ional,&endq;
added the Italian, &startq;that beyond the pillars
on the left of the ai&s;le, below a painted
window. Have you di&s;covered it? The
colours of the gla&s;s throw, in&s;tead of light,
a &s;hade over that part of the church, which,
perhaps, prevents your di&s;tingui&s;hing what
I mean!&endq;</P>
<P>The Engli&s;hman looked whither his
friend pointed, and ob&s;erved a confe&s;&s;ional
of oak, or &s;ome very dark wood, adjoining
the wall, and remarked, al&s;o, that it was the
&s;ame, which the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in had ju&s;t entered.
It con&s;i&s;ted of three compartments, covered
with a black canopy. In the central divi&s;ion
was the chair of the confe&s;&s;or, elevated by
<PB N="ix" REF="8">
&s;everal &s;teps above the pavement of the
church; and on either hand was a &s;mall
clo&s;et, or box, with &s;teps leading up to a
grated partition, at which the penitent
might kneel, and, concealed from ob&s;erva|tion,
pour into the ear of the confe&s;&s;or, the
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of crimes that lay heavy on
his heart.</P>
<P>&startq;You ob&s;erve it?&endq; &s;aid the Italian.</P>
<P>&startq;I do,&endq; replied the Engli&s;hman; &startq;it
is the &s;ame, which the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in has pa&s;&s;ed into;
and I think it one of the mo&s;t gloomy &s;pots
I ever beheld; the view of it is enough to
&s;trike a criminal with de&s;pair!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We, in Italy, are not &s;o apt to des|pair,&endq;
replied the Italian &s;milingly.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, but what of this confe&s;&s;ional?&endq;
enquired the Engli&s;hman. &startq;The a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in
entered it!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He has no relation, with what I am about
to mention,&endq; &s;aid the Italian; &startq;but I wi&s;h
you to mark the place, becau&s;e &s;ome very
extraordinary circum&s;tances belong to it.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="x" REF="9">
&startq;What are they?&endq; &s;aid the Engli&s;h|man.</P>
<P>&startq;It is now &s;everal years &s;ince the confe&s;|&s;ion,
which is connected with them, was made
at that very confe&s;&s;ional,&endq; added the Italian;
&startq;the view of it, and the &s;ight of this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in,
with your &s;urprize at the liberty which is
allowed him, led me to a recollection of the
&s;tory. When you return to the hotel, I
will communicate it to you, if you have no
plea&s;anter way of engaging your time.</P>
<P>&startq;I have a curio&s;ity to hear it,&endq; replied
the Engli&s;hman, &startq;cannot you relate it
now?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is much too long to be related now;
that would occupy a week; I have it in
writing, and will &s;end you the volume. A
young &s;tudent of Padua, who happened to
be at Naples &s;oon after this horrible confe&s;|&s;ion
became public&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Pardon me,&endq; interrupted the Engli&s;h|man,
&startq;that is &s;urely very extraordinary?
I thought confe&s;&s;ions were always held
<PB N="xi" REF="10">
&s;acred by the prie&s;t, to whom they were
made.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your ob&s;ervation is rea&s;onable,&endq; re|joined
the Italian; &startq;the faith of the prie&s;t is
never broken, except by an e&s;pecial com|mand
from an higher power; and the cir|cum&s;tances
mu&s;t even then be very extraor|dinary
to ju&s;tify &s;uch a departure from the
law. But, when you read the narrative,
your &s;urpri&s;e on this head will cea&s;e. I
was going to tell you, that it was written by
a &s;tudent of Padua, who, happening to be
here &s;oon after the affair became public, was
&s;o much &s;truck with the facts, that, partly,
as an exerci&s;e, and partly in return for &s;ome
trifling &s;ervices I had rendered him, he com|mitted
them to paper for me. You will per|ceive
from the work, that this &s;tudent was
very young, as to the arts of compo&s;ition,
but the facts are what you require, and from
the&s;e he has not deviated. But come, let
us leave the church.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="xii" REF="11">
&startq;After I have taken another view of this
&s;olemn edifice,&endq; replied the Engli&s;hman,
&startq;and particularly of the confe&s;&s;ional you
have pointed to my notice!&endq;</P>
<P>While the Engli&s;hman glanced his eye
over the high roofs, and along the &s;olemn
per&s;pectives of the Santa del Pianto, he per|ceived
the figure of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in &s;tealing from
the confe&s;&s;ional acro&s;s the choir, and, &s;hock|ed
on again beholding him, he turned his
eyes, and ha&s;tily quitted the church.</P>
<P>The friends then &s;eparated, and the
Engli&s;hman, &s;oon after returning to his
hotel, received the volume. He read as

<Q><L>&startq;What is this &s;ecret &s;in; this untold tale,</L>
<L>That art cannot extract, nor penance cleanse?&endq;</L>
<BIBL>MYSTERIOUS MOTHER.</BIBL></Q>
<P>IT was in the church of San Lorenzo at
Naples, in the year 1758, that Vincentio di
Vivaldi fir&s;t &s;aw Eliena Ro&s;alba. The
&s;weetne&s;s and fine expre&s;&s;ion of her voice at|tracted
his attention to her figure, which had
a di&s;tingui&s;hed air of delicacy and grace; but
her face was concealed in her veil. So much
indeed was he fa&s;cinated by the voice, that a
mo&s;t painful curio&s;ity was excited as to her
countenance, which he fancied mu&s;t expre&s;s
all the &s;en&s;ibility of character that the mo|dulation
<PB N="2" REF="13">
of her tones indicated. He li&s;ten|ed
to their exqui&s;ite expre&s;&s;ion with a rapt
attention, and hardly withdrew his eyes
from her per&s;on till the matin &s;ervicae had
concluded; when he ob&s;erved her leave the
church with an aged lady, who leaned upon
her arm, and who appeared to be her mo|ther.</P>
<P>Vivaldi immediately followed their &s;teps,
determined to obtain, if po&s;&s;ible, a view of
Ellena's face, and to di&s;cover the home to
which &s;he &s;hould retire. They walked
quickly, looking neither to the right or
left, and as they turned into the Strada
di Toledo he had nearly lo&s;t them; but
quickening his pace, and relinqui&s;hing the
cautious di&s;tance he had hitherto kept, he
overtook them as they entered on the Ter|razzo
Nuovo, which runs along the bay of
Naples, and leads towards the Gran Cor&s;o.
He overtook them; but the fair unknown
&s;till held her veil clo&s;e, and he knew not
how to introduce him&s;elf to her notice, or
to obtain a view of the features, which ex|cited
<PB N="3" REF="14">
his curio&s;ity. He was embarra&s;&s;ed by
a re&s;pectful timidity, that mingled with his
admiration, and which kept him &s;ilent, not|with&s;tanding
his wi&s;h to &s;peak.</P>
<P>In de&s;cending the la&s;t &s;teps of the <HI>Ter|razzo,</HI>
however, the foot of the elder lady
faltered, and, while Vivaldi ha&s;tened to a&s;&s;i&s;t
her, the breeze from the water caught the
veil, which Ellena had no longer a hand
&s;ufficiently di&s;engaged to confine, and, waft|ing
it partially a&s;ide, di&s;clo&s;ed to him a coun|tenance
more touchingly beautiful than
he had dared to image. Her features were
of the Grecian outline, and, though they
expre&s;&s;ed the tranquillity of an elegant
mind, her dark blue eyes &s;parkled with in|telligence.
She was a&s;&s;i&s;ting her companion
&s;o anxiou&s;ly, that &s;he did not immediately
ob&s;erve the admiration &s;he had in&s;pired;
but the moment her eyes met tho&s;e of
Vivaldi, &s;he became con&s;cious of their effect,
and &s;he ha&s;tily drew her veil.</P>
<P>The old lady was not materially hurt by
her fall, but, as &s;he walked difficultly, Vivaldi
<PB N="4" REF="15">
&s;eized the opportunity thus offered, and
in&s;i&s;ted that &s;he &s;hould accept his arm.
She refu&s;ed this with many acknowledg|ments;
but he pre&s;&s;ed the offer &s;o repeat|edly
and re&s;pectfully, that, at length, &s;he
accepted it, and they walked towards her
re&s;idence together.</P>
<P>On the way thither, he attempted to con|ver&s;e
with Ellena, but her replies were
conci&s;e, and he arrived at the end of the
walk while he was yet con&s;idering what he
could &s;ay, that might intere&s;t and withdraw
her from this &s;evere re&s;erve. From the
&s;tyle of their re&s;idence, he imagined that
they were per&s;ons of honourable, but mo|derate
independence. The hou&s;e was &s;mall,
but exhibited an air of comfort, and even
of ta&s;te. It &s;tood on an eminence, &s;ur|rounded,
by a garden and vineyards, which
commanded the city and bay of Naples, an
ever-moving picture, and was canopied by
a thick grove of pines and maje&s;tic date|trees;
and, though the little portico and
collonade in front were of common marble,
<PB N="5" REF="16">
the &s;tyle of architecture was elegant. While
they afforded a &s;helter from the, &s;un, they
admitted the cooling breezes that ro&s;e from
the bay below, and a pro&s;pect of the whole
&s;cope of its enchanting &s;hores.</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;topped at the little gate, which
led into the garden, where the elder lady
repeated her acknowledgments for his care,
but did not invite him to enter; and he,
trembling with anxiety and &s;inking with
di&s;appointment, remained for a moment
gazing upon Ellena, unable to take leave,
yet irre&s;olute what to &s;ay that might prolong
the interview, till the old lady again bade
him good-day. He then &s;ummoned cou|rage
enough to reque&s;t he might be allowed
to enquire after her health, and, having
obtained her permi&s;&s;ion, his eyes bade adieu
to Ellena, who, as they were parting, ven|tured
to thank him for the care he had
taken of her aunt. The &s;ound of her voice,
and this acknowledgment of obligation,
made him le&s;s willing to go than before,
but at length he tore him&s;elf away. The
<PB N="6" REF="17">
beauty of her countenance haunting his
imagination, and the touching accents of
her voice &s;till vibrating on his heart, he de|&s;cended
to the &s;hore below her re&s;idence,
plea&s;ing him&s;elf with the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of
being near her, though he could no longer
behold her; and &s;ometimes hoping that he
might again &s;ee her, however di&s;tantly, in
a balcony of the hou&s;e, where the &s;ilk
awning &s;eemed to invite the breeze from
the &s;ea. He lingered hour after hour,
&s;tretched beneath the umbrageous, pines
that waved over the &s;hore, or traver&s;ing,
regardle&s;s of the heat, the ba&s;e of the cliffs
that crowned it; recalling to his fancy the
enchantment of her &s;mile, and &s;eeming &s;till
to li&s;ten to the &s;weetne&s;s of her accents.</P>
<P>In the evening he returned to his father's
palace at Naples, thoughtful yet plea&s;ed,
anxious yet happy; dwelling with delight|ful
hope on the remembrance of the thanks
he had received from Ellena, yet not daring
to form any plan as to his future conduct.
He returned time enough to attend his
<PB N="7" REF="18">
mother in her evening ride on the Cor&s;o,
where, in every gay carriage that pa&s;&s;ed, he
hoped to &s;ee the object of his con&s;tant
thought; but &s;he did not appear. His
mother, the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi, ob&s;erved
his anxiety and unu&s;ual &s;ilence, and a&s;ked
him &s;ome que&s;tions, which &s;he meant &s;hould
lead to an explanation of the change in his
manners; but his replies only excited a
&s;tronger curio&s;ity, and, though &s;he forbore
to pre&s;s her enquiries, it was probable that
&s;he might employ a more artful means of
renewing them.</P>
<P>Vincentio di Vivaldi was the only &s;on of
the Marche&s;e di Vivaldi, a nobleman of one
of the mo&s;t ancient families of the king|dom
of Naples, a favourite po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing an un|common
&s;hare of influence at Court, and a
man &s;till higher in power than in rank.
His pride of birth was equal to either, but
it was mingled with the ju&s;tifiable pride of
a principled mind; it governed his conduct
in morals as well as in the jealou&s;y of cere|monial
di&s;tinctions, and elevated his prac|tice
<PB N="8" REF="19">
as well as his claims. His pride was
at once his vice and his virtue, his safe|guard
and his weakne&s;s.</P>
<P>The mother of Vivaldi, de&s;cended from
a family as ancient as that of his father,
was equally jealous of her importance; but
her pride was that of birth and di&s;tinction,
without extending to morals. She was of
violent pa&s;&s;ions, haughty, vindictive, yet
crafty and deceitful; patient in &s;tratagem,
and indefatigable in pur&s;uit of vengeance,
on the unhappy objects who provoked her
re&s;entment. She loved her &s;on, rather as
being the la&s;t of two illu&s;trious hou&s;es, who
was to re-unite and &s;upport the honour of
both, than with the fondne&s;s of a mother.</P>
<P>Vincentio inherited much of the charac|ter
of his father, and very little of that of
his mother. His pride was as noble and
generous as that of the Marche&s;e; but he
had &s;omewhat of the fiery pa&s;&s;ions of the
Marche&s;a, without any of her craft, her
duplicity, or vindictive thir&s;t of revenge.
Frank in his temper, ingenuous in his &s;en|timents,
<PB N="9" REF="20">
quickly offended, hut ea&s;ily ap|peased;
irritated by any, appearance of di&s;|re&s;pect,
but melted by a conce&s;&s;ion, a high
&s;en&s;e of honor rendered him no more jealous
of offence, than a delicate humanity made
him ready for reconciliation, and anxious
to &s;pare the feelings of others.</P>
<P>On the day following that, on which
he had &s;een Ellena, he returned to the villa
Altieri, to u&s;e the permi&s;&s;ion granted him
of enquiring after the health of Signora
Bianchi. The expectation of &s;eeing Ellena
agitated him with impatient joy and trem|bling
hope, which &s;till encrea&s;ed as he ap|proached
her re&s;idence, till, having reached
the garden-gate, he was obliged to re&s;t for
a few moments to recover breath and com|po&s;ure.</P>
<P>Having announced him&s;elf to an old
female &s;ervant, who came to the gate, he
was &s;oon after admitted to a &s;mall ve&s;tibule,
where he found Signora Bianchi winding
balls of &s;ilk, and alone; though from the
po&s;ition of a chair which &s;tood near a frame
<PB N="10" REF="21">
for embroidery, he judged that Ellena had
but ju&s;t quitted the apartment. Signora
Bianchi received him with a re&s;erved polite|ne&s;s,
and &s;eemed very cautious in her re|plies
to his enquiries after her niece, who,
he hoped, every moment, would appear.
He lengthened his vi&s;it till there was no
longer an excu&s;e for doing &s;o; till he had ex|hau&s;ted
every topic of conver&s;ation, and till
the &s;ilence of Signora Bianchi &s;eemed to
hint, that his departure was expected. With
a heart &s;addened by di&s;appointment, and
having obtained only a reluctant permi&s;|&s;ion
to enquire after the health of that lady
on &s;ome future day, he then took leave.</P>
<P>On his way through the garden he often
pau&s;ed to look back upon the hou&s;e, hoping
to obtain a glimp&s;e of Ellena at a lattice;
and threw a glance around him, almo&s;t ex|pecting
to &s;ee her &s;eated beneath the &s;hade
of the luxuriant plantains; but his &s;earch
was every where vain, and he quitted the
place with the &s;low and heavy &s;tep of de|&s;pondency.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="22">
The day was employed in endeavours to
obtain intelligence concerning the family of
Ellena, but of this he procured little that
was &s;atisfactory. He was told, that &s;he was
an orphan, living under the care of her aunt,
Signora Bianchi; that her family, which
had never been illu&s;trious, was decayed in
fortune, and that her only dependence was
upon this aunt. But he was ignorant of
what was very true, though very &s;ecret, that
&s;he a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;upport this aged relative,
who&s;e &s;ole property was the &s;mall e&s;tate on
which they lived, and that &s;he pa&s;&s;ed whole
days in embroidering &s;ilks, which were di&s;|po&s;ed
of to the nuns of a neighbouring con|vent,
who &s;old them to the Neapolitan
ladies, that vi&s;ited their grate, at a very
high advantage. He little thought, that a
beautiful robe, which he had often &s;een his
mother wear, was worked by Ellena; nor
that &s;ome copies from the antique, which
ornamented a cabinet of the Vivaldi palace
were drawn by her hand. If he had known
the&s;e circum&s;tances, they would, only have
<PB N="12" REF="23">
&s;erved to encrea&s;e the pa&s;&s;ion, which,
&s;ince they were proofs of a di&s;parity of for|tune,
that would certainly render his family
repugnant to a connection, with hers, it
would have been prudent to di&s;courage.</P>
<P>Ellena could have endured poverty, but
not contempt; and it was to protect her|self
from this effect of the narrow prejudices
of the world around her, that &s;he had &s;o
cautiou&s;ly concealed from it a knowledge of
the indu&s;try, which did honor to her cha|racter.
She was not a&s;hamed of poverty,
or of the indu&s;try which overcame it, but
her &s;pirit &s;hrunk from the &s;en&s;ele&s;s smile
and humiliating conde&s;cen&s;ion, which pro|&s;perity
&s;ometimes gives to indigence. Her
mind was not yet &s;trong enough, or her
views &s;ufficiently enlarged, to teach her a
contempt of the &s;neer of vicious folly, and
to glory in the dignity of virtuous inde|pendence.
Ellena was the &s;ole &s;upport of
her aunt's declining years; was patient to
her infirmities, and con&s;oling to her &s;uffer|ings;
and repaid the fondness of a mother
<PB N="13" REF="24">
with the affection of a daughter. Her mo|ther
&s;he had never known, having lo&s;t her
while &s;he was an infant, and from that pe|riod
Signora Bianchi had performed the
duties of one for her.</P>
<P>Thus innocent and happy in the &s;ilent
performance of her duties and in the veil of
retirement, lived Ellena Ro&s;alba, when &s;he
fir&s;t &s;aw Vincentio di Vivaldi. He was not
of a figure to pa&s;s unob&s;erved when &s;een,
and Ellena had been &s;truck by the &s;pirit
and dignity of his air, and by his counte|nance,
&s;o frank, noble, and full of that kind
of expre&s;&s;ion, which announces the ener|gies
of the &s;oul. But &s;he was cautious of
admitting a &s;entiment more tender than ad|miration,
and endeavoured to di&s;mi&s;s his
image from her mind, and by engaging in
her u&s;ual occupations, to recover the &s;tate
of tranquillity, which his appearance had
&s;omewhat interrupted.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, mean while, re&s;tle&s;s from di&s;ap|pointment,
and impatient from anxiety,
having pa&s;&s;ed the greater part of the day in
<PB N="14" REF="25">
enquiries, which repaid him only with doubt
and apprehen&s;ion, determined to return to the
villa Altieri, when evening &s;hould conceal his
&s;teps, con&s;oled by the certainty of being
near the object of his thoughts, and hop|ing,
that chance might favour him once
more with a view, however tran&s;ient, of
Ellena.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a Vivaldi held an a&s;&s;embly
this evening, and a &s;u&s;picion concerning the
impatience he betrayed, induced her to de|tain
him about her per&s;on to a late hour,
engaging him to &s;elect the mu&s;ic for her
orche&s;tra, and to &s;uperintend the perform|ance
of a new piece, the work of a com|po&s;er
whom &s;he had brought into fa&s;hion.
Her a&s;&s;emblies were among the mo&s;t bril|liant
and crowded in Naples, and the nobi|lity,
who were to be at the palace this even|ing,
were divided into two parties as to the
merits of the mu&s;ical genius, whom &s;he pa|tronized,
and tho&s;e of another candidate
for fame. The performance of the evening
it was expected, would finally decide the
<PB N="15" REF="26">
victory. This, therefore, was a night of
great importance and anxiety to the Mar|che&s;a,
for &s;he was as jealous of the reputa|tion
of her favourite compo&s;er as of her
own, and the welfare of her &s;on did but
&s;lightly divide her cares.</P>
<P>The moment he could depart unob&s;erved,
he quitted the a&s;&s;embly, and, muffling him|&s;elf
in his cloak, ha&s;tened to the villa Al|tieri,
which lay at a &s;hort di&s;tance to the
we&s;t of the city. He reached it unob&s;erved,
and, breathle&s;s with, impatience, traver&s;ed
the boundary of the garden; where, free
from ceremonial re&s;traint, and near the ob|ject
of his affection, he experienced for the
few fir&s;t moments a joy as exqui&s;ite as her
pre&s;ence could have in&s;pired. But this de|light
faded with its novelty, and in a &s;hort
time he felt as forlorn as if he was &s;eparated
for ever from Ellena, in who&s;e pre&s;ence he
but lately almo&s;t believed him&s;elf.</P>
<P>The night was far advanced, and, no light
appearing from the hou&s;e, he concluded the
inhabitants had retired to re&s;t, and all hope
<PB N="16" REF="27">
of &s;eeing her vani&s;hed from his mind. Still,
however, it was &s;weet to be near her, and
he anxiou&s;ly &s;ought to gain admittance to
the gardens, that he might approach the
window where it was po&s;&s;ible &s;he repo&s;ed.
The boundary, formed of trees and thick
&s;hrubs, was not difficult to be pa&s;&s;ed, and
he found him&s;elf once more in the portico of the villa.</P>
<P>It was nearly midnight, and the &s;tillne&s;s
that reigned was rather &s;oothed than in|terrupted
by the gentle da&s;hing of the wa|ters
of the bay below, and by the hollow
murmurs of Ve&s;uvius, which threw up, at
intervals its &s;udden flame on the horizon,
and then left it to darkne&s;s. The &s;olem|nity
of the &s;cene accorded with the temper
of his mind, and he li&s;tened in deep atten|tion
for the returning &s;ounds, which broke
upon the ear like di&s;tant thunder muttering
imperfectly from the clouds. The pau&s;es
of &s;ilence, that &s;ucceeded each groan of the
mountain, when expectation li&s;tened for the
ri&s;ing &s;ound, affected the imagination of
<PB N="17" REF="28">
Vivaldi at this time with particular awe,
and, rapt in thought, he continued to gaze
upon the &s;ublime and &s;hadowy outline of the
&s;hores, and on the &s;ea, ju&s;t di&s;cerned be|neath
the twilight of a cloudle&s;s &s;ky. Along
its grey &s;urface many ve&s;&s;els were pur&s;uing
their &s;ilent cour&s;e, guided over the deep
waters only by the polar &s;tar, which burned
with &s;teady lu&s;tre. The air was calm, and
ro&s;e from the bay with mo&s;t balmy and re|fre&s;hing
coolne&s;s; it &s;carcely &s;tirred the
heads of the broad pines that over&s;pread
the villa; and bore no &s;ounds but of the
waves and the groans of the far-off moun|tain,&mdash;till
a chaunting of deep voices,
&s;welled from a di&s;tance. The &s;olemn cha|racter
of the &s;train engaged his attention;
he perceived that it was a requiem, and he
endeavoured to di&s;cover from what quarter
it came. It advanced, though di&s;tantly, and
then pa&s;&s;ed away on the air. The circum|&s;tance
&s;truck him; he knew it was u&s;ual in
&s;ome parts of Italy to chaunt this &s;train over
the bed of the dying; but here the mourn|ers
<PB N="18" REF="29">
&s;eemed to walk the earth, or the air.
He was not doubtful as to the &s;train it&s;elf;&mdash;once
before he had heard it, and attend|ed
with circum&s;tances which made it im|po&s;&s;ible
that he &s;hould ever forget it. As
he now li&s;tened to the choral voices &s;often|ing
in di&s;tance, a few pathetic notes brought
full upon his remembrance the divine me|lody
he had heard Ellena utter in the church
of San Lorenzo. Overcome by the recollec|tion,
he &s;tarted away, and, wandering over
the garden, reached another &s;ide of the
villa, where he &s;oon heard the voice of El|lena
her&s;elf, performing the midnight hymn
to the Virgin, and accompanied by a lute,
which &s;he touched with mo&s;t affecting and
delicate expre&s;&s;ion. He &s;tood for a moment
entranced, and &s;carcely daring to breathe,
le&s;t he &s;hould lo&s;e any note of that meek
and holy &s;train, which &s;eemed to flow from
a devotion almo&s;t &s;aintly. Then, looking
round to di&s;cover the object of his admira|tion,
a light i&s;&s;uing from among the bowery
foliage of a clematis led him to a lattice, and
<PB N="19" REF="30">
&s;hewed him Ellena. The lattice had been
thrown open to admit the cool air, and he
had a full view of her and the apartment.
She was ri&s;ing from a &s;mall altar where &s;he
had concluded the &s;ervice; the glow of
devotion was &s;till upon her countenance as
&s;he rai&s;ed her eyes, and with a rapt ear|ne&s;tne&s;s
fixed them on the heavens. She
&s;till held the lute, but no longer awakened
it, and &s;eemed lo&s;t to every &s;urrounding ob|ject.
Her fine hair was negligently bound
up in a &s;ilk net, and &s;ome tre&s;&s;es that had
e&s;caped it, played on her neck, and round
her beautiful countenance, which now was
not even partially concealed by a veil. The
light drapery of her dre&s;s, her whole figure,
air, and attitude, were &s;uch as might have
been copied for a Grecian nymph.</P>
<P>Vivaldi was perplexed and agitated be|tween
the wi&s;h of &s;eizing an opportunity,
which might never again occur, of pleading
his love, and the fear of offending, by in|truding
upon her retirement, at &s;o &s;acred an
hour; but, while he thus he&s;itated, he
<PB N="20" REF="31">
heard her &s;igh, and then with a &s;weetne&s;s
peculiar to her accent, pronounce his name.
During the trembling anxiety, with which
he li&s;tened to what might follow this men|tion
of his name, he di&s;turbed the clematis
that &s;urrounded the lattice, and &s;he turned
her eyes towards the window; but Vivaldi
was entirely concealed by the foliage. She,
however, ro&s;e to clo&s;e the lattice; as &s;he
approached which, Vivaldi, unable any
longer to command him&s;elf, appeared before
her. She &s;tood fixed for an in&s;tant, while
her countenance changed to an a&s;hy pale|ne&s;s;
and then, with trembling ha&s;te clo&s;|ing
the lattice, quitted the apartment. Vi|valid
felt as if all his hopes had vani&s;hed
with her.</P>
<P>After lingering in the garden for &s;ome
time without perceiving a light in any other
part of the building, or hearing a &s;ound pro|ceed
from it, he took his melancholy way to
Naples. He now began to a&s;k him&s;elf
&s;ome que&s;tions, which he ought to have
urged before, and to enquire wherefore he
<PB N="21" REF="32">
&s;ought the dangerous plea&s;ure of &s;eeing
Ellena, &s;ince her family was of &s;uch a con|dition
as rendered the con&s;ent of his parents
to a marriage with her unattainable.</P>
<P>He was lo&s;t in revery on this, &s;ubject,
&s;ometimes half re&s;olved to &s;eek her no
more, and then &s;hrinking from a conduct,
which &s;eemed to &s;trike him with the, force,
of de&s;pair, when, as he emerged from the
dark arch of a ruin, that extended over the
road, his &s;teps were cro&s;&s;ed by a per&s;on in the
habit of a monk, who&s;e face was &s;hrouded
by his cowl &s;till more than by the twilight.
The &s;tranger, addre&s;&s;ing him by his name,
&s;aid, &startq;Signor! your &s;teps are watched;
beware how you revi&s;it Altieri!&endq; Having
uttered this, he di&s;appeared, before Vivaldi
could return the &s;word he had half drawn
into the &s;cabbard, or demand an explana|tion
of the words he had heard. He called
loudly and repeatedly, conjuring the un|known
per&s;on to appear, and lingered near
the &s;pot for a con&s;iderable time; but the vi|&s;ion
came no more.</P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="33">
Vivaldi arrived at home with a mind oc|cupied
by this incident, and tormented by
the jealou&s;y to which it gave ri&s;e; for, af|ter
indulging various conjectures, he con|cluded
with believing the notice, of which
he had been warned, to be that of a rival,
and that the danger which menaced him,
was from the poniard of jealou&s;y. This be|lief
di&s;covered to him at once the extent of
his pa&s;&s;ion, and of the imprudence, which
had thus readily admitted it; yet &s;o far was
this new prudence from overcoming his er|ror,
that, &s;tung with a torture, more exqui|&s;ite
than he had ever known, he re&s;olved,
at every event, to declare his love, and &s;ue
for the hand of Ellena. Unhappy young
man, he knew not the fatal error, into
which pa&s;&s;ion was precipitating him!</P>
<P>On his arrival at the Vivaldi palace, he
learned, that the Marche&s;a had ob&s;erved his
ab&s;ence, had repeatedly enquired for him,
and had given orders that the time of his
return &s;hould be mentioned to her. She
had, however, retired to re&s;t; but the Mar|che&s;e,
<PB N="23" REF="34">
who had attended the King on an
excur&s;ion to one of the royal villas on the
bay, returned home &s;oon after Vincentio;
and, before he had withdrawn to his apart|ment,
he met his &s;on with looks of unu&s;ual
di&s;plea&s;ure, but avoided &s;aying any thing,
which either explained or alluded to the &s;ub|ject
of it; and, after a &s;hort conver&s;ation,
they &s;eparated.</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;hut him&s;elf in his apartment to
deliberate, if that may de&s;erve the name of
deliberation, in which a conflict of pa&s;&s;ions,
rather than an exertion of judgment, pre|vailed.
For &s;everal hours he traver&s;ed his
&s;uit of rooms, alternately tortured by the
remembrance of Ellena, fired with jealou&s;y,
and alarmed for the con&s;equence of the
imprudent &s;tep, which he was about to take.
He knew the temper of his father, and &s;ome
traits of the character of his mother, &s;uffi|ciently
to fear that, their di&s;plea&s;ure would
be irreconcilable concerning the marriage
he meditated; yet, when he con&s;idered that
he was their only &s;on, he was inclined, to
<PB N="24" REF="35">
admit a hope of forgivene&s;s, notwith&s;tand|ing
the weight which the circum&s;tance mu&s;t
add to their di&s;appointment. The&s;e re|flexions
were frequently interrupted by fears.
le&s;t Ellena had already di&s;po&s;ed of her af|fections
to this imaginary rival. He was,
however, &s;omewhat con&s;oled by remember|ing
the &s;igh &s;he had uttered, and the ten|derne&s;s,
with which &s;he had immediately
pronounced his name. Yet, even if &s;he were
not aver&s;e to his &s;uit, how could, he &s;olicit
her hand, and hope it would be given him,
when he &s;hould declare that this mu&s;t be in
&s;ecret? He &s;carcely dared to believe that
&s;he would conde&s;cend to enter a family
who di&s;dained to receive her; and again
de&s;pondency overcame him.</P>
<P>The morning found him as di&s;tracted as
the night had left him; his determination,
however, was fixed; and this was, to &s;a|crifice
what he now con&s;idered as a delu&s;ive
pride of birth, to a choice which he be|lieved
would en&s;ure the happine&s;s of his life
<PB N="25" REF="36">
But, before he ventured to declare him&s;elf
to Ellena, it appeared nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain
whether he held an intere&s;t in her heart, or
whether &s;he had devoted it to the rival of
his love, and who this rival really was. It
was &s;o much ea&s;ier to wi&s;h for &s;uch inform|ation
than to obtain it, that, after forming
a thou&s;and projects, either the delicacy of
his re&s;pect for Ellena, or his fear of of|fending
her, or an apprehension of di&s;co|very
from his family before he had &s;ecured
an intere&s;t in her affections, con&s;tantly op|po&s;ed
his views of an enquiry.</P>
<P>In this difficulty he opened his heart to a
friend, who had long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed his confi|dence,
and who&s;e advice he &s;olicited with
&s;omewhat more anxiety and &s;incerity than
is u&s;ual on &s;uch occasions. It was not a
&s;anction of his own opinion that he re|quired,
but the impartial judgment of ano|ther
mind. Bonarmo, however little he
might be qualified for the office of an ad|vi&s;er,
did not &s;cruple to give his advice. As
a means of judging whether Ellena was di&s;|po&s;ed
<PB N="26" REF="37">
to favour Vivaldi's addre&s;&s;es, he
propo&s;ed that, according to the cu&s;tom of
the country, a &s;erenade &s;hould be given;
he maintained, that, if &s;he was not di&s;in|clined
towards him, &s;ome &s;ign of approba|tion
would appear; and if otherwi&s;e, that
&s;he would remain &s;ilent and invi&s;ible. Vi|valid
objected to this coar&s;e and inadequate
mode of expre&s;&s;ing a love &s;o &s;acred as his,
and he had too lofty an opinion of Ellena's
mind and delicacy, to believe, that the tri|fling
homage of a &s;erenade would either
flatter her &s;elf-love, or intere&s;t her in his
favour; nor, if it did, could he venture to
believe, that &s;he would di&s;play any &s;ign of
approbation.</P>
<P>His friend laughed at his &s;cruples and at
his opinion of what he called &s;uch romantic
delicacy, that his ignorance of the world
was his only excu&s;e for having cheri&s;hed
them. But Vivaldi interrupted this rail|lery,
and would neither &s;uffer him for a
moment to &s;peak thus of Ellena, or to call
&s;uch delicacy romantic. Bonarmo, how|ever,
<PB N="27" REF="38">
&s;till urged the &s;erenade as at lea&s;t a
po&s;&s;ible means of di&s;covering her di&s;po&s;i|tion
towards him before he made a formal
avowal of his &s;uit; and Vivaldi, perplexed
and di&s;tracted with apprehen&s;ion and impa|tience
to terminate his pre&s;ent &s;tate of &s;u&s;|pen&s;e,
was at length &s;o far overcome by
his own difficulties, rather than by his
friend's per&s;ua&s;ion, that he con&s;ented to
make the adventure of a &s;erenade on the
approaching night. This was adopted ra|ther
as a refuge from de&s;pondency, than with
any hope of &s;ucce&s;s; for he &s;till believed
that Ellena would not give any hint, that
might terminate his uncertainty.</P>
<P>Beneath their cloaks they carried mu&s;ical
in&s;truments, and, muffling up their faces,
&s;o that they could not be known, they
proceeded, in thoughtful &s;ilence on the way
to the villa Altieri. Already they had pa&s;&s;ed
the arch, in which Vivaldi was &s;topped by
the &s;tranger on the preceding night, when
he heard a &s;udden &s;ound near him, and,
rai&s;ing his head from the cloak, he per|ceived
<PB N="28" REF="39">
the &s;ame figure! Before he had
time for exclamation, the &s;tranger cro&s;&s;ed
him again. &startq;Go not to the villa Altieri,&endq;
&s;aid he in a &s;olemn voice, &startq;le&s;t you meet
the fate you ought to dread.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What fate?&endq; demanded Vivaldi, &s;tep|ping
back; &startq;Speak, I conjure you!&endq;.</P>
<P>But the monk was gone, and the dark|ne&s;s
of the hour baffled ob&s;ervation as to
the way of his departure.</P>
<P><HI>&startq;Dio mi guardi!&endq;</HI> exclaimed Bonarmo,
this is almo&s;t beyond belief! but let us
return to Naples; this &s;econd warning
ought to be obeyed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is almo&s;t beyond endurance,&endq; ex|claimed
Vivaldi; &startq;which way did he
pa&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He glided by me,&endq; replied Bonarmo,
and he was gone before I could cro&s;s
him!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will tempt the wor&s;t at once,&endq; &s;aid
Vivaldi; &startq;if I have a rival, it is be&s;t to
meet him. Let us go on.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="40">
Bonarmo remon&s;trated, and repre&s;ented
the &s;erious danger that threatened from &s;o
ra&s;h a proceeding. &startq;It is evident that
you have a rival,&endq; &s;aid he; &startq;and your
courage cannot avail you again&s;t hired
bravos.&endq; Vivaldi's heart &s;welled at the
mention of a rival. &startq;If you think it
dangerous to proceed, I will go alone,&endq;
&s;aid he.</P>
<P>Hurt by this reproof, Bonarmo accom|panied
his friend in &s;ilence, and they
reached without interruption the boundary
of the villa. Vivaldi led to the place by
which he had entered on the preceding
night, and they pa&s;&s;ed unmole&s;ted into the
garden.</P>
<P>&startq;Where are the&s;e terrible bravos of
whom you warned me?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, with
taunting exultation.</P>
<P>&startq;Speak cautiou&s;ly,&endq; replied his friend;
we may, even now, be within their
reach.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They al&s;o may be within ours,&endq; ob|&s;erved
Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="30" REF="41">
At length, the&s;e adventurous friends came
to the orangery, which was near the hou&s;e,
when, tired by the a&s;cent, they re&s;ted to re|cover
breath, and to prepare their in&s;tru|ments
for the &s;erenade. The night was
&s;till, and they now heard, for the fir&s;t time,
murmurs as of a di&s;tant multitude; and
then the &s;udden &s;plendor of fireworks broke
upon the sky. The&s;e aro&s;e from a villa on
the we&s;tern margin of the bay, and were
given in honour of the birth of one of the
royal princes. They &s;oared to an immen&s;e
height, and, as their lu&s;tre broke &s;ilently
upon the night, it lightened on the thou|&s;and
up-turned faces of the gazing crowd,
illumined the waters of the bay, with every
little boat that &s;kimmed its &s;urface, and
&s;hewed di&s;tinctly the whole &s;weep of its
ri&s;ing &s;hores, the &s;tately city of Naples on
the &s;trand below, and, &s;preading far among
the hills, its terraced roofs crowded with
&s;pectators, and the Cor&s;o tumultuous with
carriages and blazing with torches.</P>

While Bonarmo &s;urveyed this magnifi|cent
&s;cene, Vivaldi turned his eyes to the
re&s;idence of Ellena, part of which looked
out from among the trees, with a hope that
the &s;pectacle would draw her to a balcony;
but &s;he did not appear, nor was there any
light, that might indicate her approach.</P>
<P>While they &s;till re&s;ted on the turf of the
orangery, they heard a, &s;udden ru&s;tling of
the leaves, as if the branches were di&s;turbed
by &s;ome per&s;on who endeavoured to make
his way between them, when Vivaldi de|manded
who pa&s;&s;ed. No an&s;wer was re|turned,
and a long &s;ilence followed.</P>
<P>&startq;We are ob&s;erved,&endq; &s;aid Bonarmo, at
length, &startq;and are even now, perhaps, al|mo&s;t
beneath the poinard of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in:
let us be gone.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O that my heart were as &s;ecure from
the darts of love, the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in of my peace,&endq;
exclaimed Vivaldi, &startq;as yours is from tho&s;e
of bravos! My friend, you have little to
intere&s;t you, &s;ince your thoughts have &s;o
much lei&s;ure for apprehen&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="32" REF="43">
&startq;My fear is that of prudence, not of
weakne&s;s,&endq; retorted Bonarmo, with acri|mony;
&startq;you will find, perhaps, that I
have none, when you mo&s;t wi&s;h me to po&s;|&s;e&s;s it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I under&s;tand you,&endq; replied Vivaldi;
&startq;let us fini&s;h this bu&s;ine&s;s, and you &s;hall
receive reparation, &s;ince you believe your|&s;elf
injured: I am as anxious to repair an
offence, as jealous of receiving one.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&endq; replied Bonarmo, &startq;you would
repair the injury you have done your friend
with, his blood.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Oh! never, never!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, fall|ing
on his neck. &startq;Forgive my ha&s;ty&endq; vio|lence;
allow for the di&s;traction of my
mind.&endq;</P>
<P>Bonarmo returned the embrace. &startq;It is
enough,&endq; &s;aid he; &startq;no more, no more!
I hold again my friend to my heart.&endq;</P>
<P>While this conver&s;ation pa&s;&s;ed, they had
quitted the orangery, and reached the walls
of the villa, where they took their &s;tation
under a balcony that overhung the lattice,
<PB N="33" REF="44">
through which Vivaldi had &s;een Ellena on
the preceding night. They tuned their in|&s;truments,
and opened the &s;erenade with a
duet.</P>
<P>Vivaldi's voice was a fine tenor, and the
&s;ame &s;u&s;ceptibility, which made him pa&s;&s;ion|ately
fond of mu&s;ic, taught him to modu|late
its cadence with exqui&s;ite delicacy, and
to give his empha&s;is with the mo&s;t &s;imple
and pathetic expre&s;&s;ion. His &s;oul &s;eemed to
breathe in the &s;ounds,&mdash;&s;o tender, &s;o im|ploring,
yet &s;o energetic. On this night, en|thu&s;ia&s;m
in&s;pired him with the highe&s;t elo|quence,
perhaps, which mu&s;ic is capable
of attaining; what might be its effect on
Ellena he had no means of judging, for &s;he
did not appear either at the balcony or the
lattice, nor gave any hint of applau&s;e. No
&s;ounds &s;tole on the &s;tillne&s;s of the night,
except tho&s;e of the &s;erenade, nor did any
light from within the villa break upon the
ob&s;curity without; once, indeed, in a pau&s;e
of the in&s;truments, Bonarmo fancied he
di&s;tingui&s;hed voices near him, as of per&s;ons
<PB N="34" REF="45">
who feared to be heard, and he li&s;tened at|tentively,
but without a&s;certaining the truth.
Sometimes they &s;eemed to &s;ound heavily in
his ear, and then a death-like &s;ilence pre|vailed.
Vivaldi affirmed the &s;ound to be
nothing more than the confu&s;ed murmur
of the di&s;tant multitude on the &s;hore, but
Bonarmo was not thus ea&s;ily convinced.</P>
<P>The mu&s;icians, un&s;ucce&s;sful in their first
endeavour to attract attention, removed to
the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the building, and plac|ed
them&s;elves in front of the portico, but
with as little &s;ucce&s;s; and, after having ex|erci&s;ed
their powers of harmony and of pa|tience
for above an hour, they re&s;igned all
further effort to win upon the obdurate
Ellena. Vivaldi, notwith&s;tanding the feeble|ne&s;s
of his fir&s;t hope of &s;eeing her, now
&s;uffered an agony of di&s;appointment; and
Bonarmo, alarmed for the con&s;equence of
his de&s;pair, was as anxious to per&s;uade him
that he had no rival, as he had lately been
pertinacious in affirming that he had one.</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="46">
At length, they left the gardens, Vivaldi
prote&s;ting that he would not re&s;t till he
had di&s;covered the &s;tranger, who &s;o wan|tonly
de&s;troyed his peace, and had com|pelled
him to explain his ambiguous war|nings;
and Bonarmo remon&s;trating on the
imprudence and difficulty of the &s;earch,
and repre&s;enting that &s;uch conduct would
probably be the means of &s;preading a re|port
of his attachment, where mo&s;t he dread|ed
it &s;hould be known.</P>
<P>Vivaldi refu&s;ed to yield to remon&s;trance
or con&s;iderations of any kind. &startq;We &s;hall
&s;ee,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;whether this demon in the
garb of a monk, will haunt me again at the
accu&s;tomed place; if he does, he &s;hall not
e&s;cape my gra&s;p; and if he does not, I will
watch as vigilantly for his return, as he
&s;eems to have done for mine. I will lurk
in the &s;hade of the ruin, and wait for him,
though it be till death!&endq;</P>
<P>Bonarmo was particularly &s;truck by the
vehemence with which he pronounced the
la&s;t words, but he no longer oppo&s;ed his
<PB N="36" REF="47">
purpo&s;e, and only bade him con&s;ider whe|ther
he was well armed, &startq;For,&endq; he added,
&startq;you may have need of arms there, though
you had no u&s;e for them at the villa Altieri.
Remember that the &s;tranger told you that
your &s;teps were watched.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have my &s;word,&endq; replied Vivaldi,
&startq;and the dagger which I u&s;ually wear; but
I ought to enquire what are your weapons
of defence.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hu&s;h!&endq; &s;aid Bonarmo, as they turned
the foot of a rock that overhung the road,
&startq;we are approaching the &s;pot; yonder is
the arch!&endq; It appeared du&s;kily in the per|&s;pective,
&s;u&s;pended between two cliffs, where
the road wound from &s;ight, on one of which
were the ruins of the Roman fort it belonged
to, and on the other, &s;hadowing pines, and
thickets of oak that tufted the rock to its ba&s;e.</P>
<P>They proceeded in &s;ilence, treading light|ly,
and often throwing a &s;u&s;picious glance
around, expecting every in&s;tant that the
monk would &s;teal out upon them from
&s;ome rece&s;s of the cliffs. But they pa&s;&s;ed
<PB N="37" REF="48">
on unmole&s;ted to the arch-way. &startq;We are
here before him, however,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi as
they entered the darkne&s;s. &startq;Speak low,
my friend,&endq; &s;aid Bonarmo, &startq;others be&s;ides
our&s;elves may be &s;hrouded in this ob&s;curity.
I like not the place.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who but our&s;elves would chu&s;e &s;o di&s;|mal
a retreat?&endq; whi&s;pered Vivaldi, &startq;unle&s;s
indeed, it were banditti; the &s;avagene&s;s of
the &s;pot would, in truth, &s;uit their humour,
and it &s;uits well al&s;o with my own.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It would &s;uit their purpo&s;e too, as
well as their humour,&endq; ob&s;erved Bonarmo.
&startq;Let us remove from this deep &s;hade, into
the more open road, where we can as clo&s;e|ly
ob&s;erve who pa&s;&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi objected that in the road they
might them&s;elves be ob&s;erved, &startq;and if we
are &s;een by my unknown tormentor, our
de&s;ign is defeated, for he comes upon us
&s;uddenly, or not at all, le&s;t we &s;hould be
prepared to detain him.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, as he &s;aid this, took his &s;tation
within the thicke&s;t gloom of the arch, which
<PB N="38" REF="49">
was of con&s;iderable depth, and near a flight
of &s;teps that was cut in the rock, and a&s;|cended
to the fortre&s;s. His friend &s;tepped
clo&s;e to his &s;ide. After a pau&s;e of &s;ilence,
during which Bonarmo was meditating, and
Vivaldi was impatiently watching, &startq;Do
you really believe,&endq; &s;aid the former, &startq;that
any effort to detain him would be effectual?
He glided pa&s;t me with a &s;trange facility,
it was &s;urely more than human!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is it you mean? enquired Vi|valdi.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, I mean that I could be &s;uper|&s;titious.
This place, perhaps, infe&s;ts my
mind with, congenial gloom, for I find that,
at this moment, there is &s;carcely a &s;uper&s;ti|tion
too dark for my credulity.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;miled. &startq;And you mu&s;t; allow,&endq;
added Bonarmo, &startq;that he has appeared,
under circum&s;tances &s;omewhat extraordi|nary.
How &s;hould he know your name,
by which, you &s;ay, he addre&s;&s;ed you at the
fir&s;t meeting? How &s;hould he know from
whence you came, or whether you de&s;igned
<PB N="39" REF="50">
to return? By what magic could he become
acquainted with your plans?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nor am I certain that he is acquainted
with them,&endq; ob&s;erved Vivaldi; &startq;but if he
is, there was no nece&s;&s;ity for &s;uperhuman
means to obtain &s;uch knowledge.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The re&s;ult of this evening &s;urely ought
to convince you that he is acquainted with
your de&s;igns,&endq; &s;aid Bonarmo. &startq;Do you
believe it po&s;&s;ible that Ellena could have
been in&s;en&s;ible to your attentions, if her
heart had not been pre-engaged, and that &s;he
would not have &s;hewn her&s;elf at a lattice?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You do not know Ellena,&endq; replied Vi|valdi,
&startq;and therefore I once more pardon
you the que&s;tion. Yet had &s;he been di&s;|po&s;ed
to accept my addre&s;&s;es, &s;urely &s;ome;
&s;ign of approbation,&endq;&mdash;he checked him|&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;tranger warned you not to go to
the villa Altieri,&endq; re&s;umed Bonarmo, &startq;he
&s;eemed to anticipate the reception, which
awaited you, and to know a danger, which
hitherto you have happily e&s;caped.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="40" REF="51">
&startq;Yes, he anticipated too well that re|ception,&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi, lo&s;ing his prudence
in pa&s;&s;ionate exclamation; &startq;and he is him|&s;elf,
perhaps, the rival, whom he has taught
me to &s;u&s;pect. He has a&s;&s;umed a di&s;gui&s;e
only the more effectually to impo&s;e upon
my credulity, and to deter me from addre&s;|&s;ing
Ellena. And &s;hall I tamely lie in wait
for his approach? Shall I lurk like a guilty
a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in for this rival?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For heaven's &s;ake!&endq; &s;aid Bonarmo,
&startq;moderate the&s;e tran&s;ports; con&s;ider where
you are. This furmi&s;e of yours is in the
highe&s;t degree improbable.&endq; He gave his
rea&s;ons for thinking &s;o, and the&s;e convinced
Vivaldi, who was prevailed upon to be once
more patient.</P>
<P>They had remained watchful and &s;till for
a con&s;iderable time, when Bonarmo &s;aw a
per&s;on approach the end of the arch-way
neare&s;t to Altieri. He heard no &s;tep, but
he perceived a &s;hadowy figure &s;tation it&s;elf
at the entrance of the arch, where the twi|light
of this brilliant climate was, for a few
<PB N="41" REF="52">
paces, admitted. Vivaldi's eyes were fixed
on the road leading towards Naples, and he,
therefore, did not perceive the object of
Bonarmo's attention, who, fearful of his
friend's precipitancy, forbore to point out
immediately what he ob&s;erved, judging it
more prudent to watch the motions of this
unknown per&s;on, that he might a&s;certain
whether it really were the monk. The &s;ize
of the figure, and the dark drapery in which
it &s;eemed wrapt, induced him, at length, to
believe that this was the expected &s;tranger;
and he &s;eized Vivaldi's arm to direct his at|tention
to him, when the form gliding for|ward
di&s;appeared in the gloom, but not
before Vivaldi had under&s;tood the occa&s;ion
of his friend's ge&s;ture and &s;ignificant &s;ilence.
They heard no foot&s;tep pa&s;s them, and,
being convinced that this per&s;on, whatever
he was, had not left the arch-way, they kept
their &s;tation in watchful &s;tillne&s;s. Pre&s;ently
they heard a ru&s;tling, as of garments, near
them, and Vivaldi, unable longer to com|mand
his patience, &s;tarted from his conceal|ment,
<PB N="42" REF="53">
and with arms extended to prevent
any one from e&s;caping, demanded who was
there.</P>
<P>The &s;ound cea&s;ed, and no reply was made.
Bonarmo drew his &s;word, prote&s;ting he
would &s;tab the air till he found the per&s;on
who lurked there; but that if the latter
would di&s;cover him&s;elf, he &s;hould receive
no injury. This a&s;&s;urance Vivaldi confirm|ed
by his promi&s;e. Still no an&s;wer was re|turned;
but as they li&s;tened for a voice,
they thought &s;omething pa&s;&s;ed them, and
the avenue was not narrow enough to have
prevented &s;uch a circum&s;tance. Vivaldi
ru&s;hed forward, but did not perceive any
per&s;on i&s;&s;ue from the arch into the highway,
where the &s;tronger twilight mu&s;t have di&s;|covered
him.</P>
<P>&startq;Somebody certainly pa&s;&s;ed,&endq; whi&s;pered
Bonarmo, &startq;and I think I hear a &s;ound from
yonder &s;teps, that lead to the fortre&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let us follow,&endq; cried Vivaldi, and he
began to a&s;cend.</P>
<P><PB N="43" REF="54">
&startq;Stop, for heaven's &s;ake &s;top!&endq; &s;aid
Bonarmo; &startq;con&s;ider what you are about!
Do not brave the utter darkne&s;s of the&s;e
ruins; do not pur&s;ue the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in to his
den!&endq;.</P>
<P>&startq;It is the monk him&s;elf!&endq; exclaimed
Vivaldi, &s;till a&s;cending; &startq;he &s;hall not e&s;cape
me!&endq;</P>
<P>Bonarmo pau&s;ed a moment at the foot of
the &s;teps, and his friend di&s;appeared; he
he&s;itated what to do, till a&s;hamed of &s;uffer|ing
him to encounter danger alone, he
&s;prang to the flight, and not without diffi|culty
&s;urmounted the rugged &s;teps.</P>
<P>Having reached the &s;ummit of the rock,
he found him&s;elf on a terrace, that ran along
the top of the arch-way, and had once been,
fortified; this, cro&s;&s;ing the road, command|ed
the de&s;ile each way. Some remains of
ma&s;sy walls, that &s;till exhibited loops for
archers, were all that now hinted of its
former u&s;e. It led to a watch-tower almo&s;t
concealed in thick pines, that crowned the
oppo&s;ite cliff, and had thus &s;erved not only
<PB N="44" REF="55">
for a &s;trong battery over the road, but, con|necting
the oppo&s;ite &s;ides of the defile, had
formed a line of communication between the
fort and this out-po&s;t.</P>
<P>Bonarmo looked round in vain for his
friend, and the echoes of his own voice only,
among the rocks, replied to his repeated
calls. After &s;ome he&s;itation whether to
enter the walls of the main building, or to
cro&s;s to the watch-tower, he determined on
the former, and entered a rugged area, the
walls of which, following the declivities of
the precipice, could &s;carcely now be traced.
The citadel, a round tower, of maje&s;tic
&s;trength, with &s;ome Roman arches &s;cattered
near, was all that remained of this once im|portant
fortre&s;s; except indeed, a ma&s;s of
ruins near the edge of the cliff, the con|&s;truction
of which made it difficult to gue&s;s
for what purpo&s;e it had been de&s;igned.</P>
<P>Bonarmo entered the immen&s;e walls of
the citadel, but the utter darkne&s;s within
checked his progre&s;s, and, contenting him|&s;elf
with calling loudly on Vivaldi, he re|turned
to the open air.</P>
<P><PB N="45" REF="56">
As he approached the ma&s;s of ruins, who&s;e
&s;ingular form had intere&s;ted his curio&s;ity,
he thought he di&s;tingui&s;hed the low accents
of a human voice, and while he li&s;tened in
anxiety, a per&s;on ru&s;hed forth from a door|way
of the ruin, carrying a drawn &s;word.
It was Vivaldi him&s;elf. Bonarmo &s;prang to
meet him; he was pale and breathle&s;s, and
&s;ome moments elap&s;ed before he could
&s;peak, or appeared to hear the repeated en|quiries
of his friend.</P>
<P>&startq;Let us go,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;let us leave
this place!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mo&s;t willingly,&endq; replied Bonarmo,
&startq;but where have you been, and who have
you &s;een, that you are thus affected.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;k me no more que&s;tions, let us go,&endq;
repeated Vivaldi.</P>
<P>They de&s;cended the rock together, and
when, having reached the arch-way, Bo|narmo
enquired, half &s;portively, whether
they &s;hould remain any longer on the watch,
his friend an&s;wered, &startq;No!&endq; with an em|pha&s;is
that &s;tartled him. They pa&s;&s;ed ha&s;tily
<PB N="46" REF="57">
on the way to Naples, Bonarmo repeating
enquiries which Vivaldi &s;eemed reluctant to
&s;atisfy, and wondering no le&s;s at the cau&s;e of
this &s;udden re&s;erve, than anxious to know
whom he had &s;een.</P>
<P>&startq;It was the monk, then,&endq; &s;aid Bonarmo;
&startq;you &s;ecured him at la&s;t?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know not what to think,&endq; replied
Vivaldi, &startq;I am more perplexed than ever.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He e&s;caped you then?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We will &s;peak of this in future,&endq; &s;aid
Vivaldi; &startq;but be it as it may, the bu&s;ine&s;s
re&s;ts not here. I will return in the night
of to-morrow with a torch; dare you ven|ture
your&s;elf with me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know not,&endq; replied Bonarmo, &startq;whe|ther
I ought to do &s;o, &s;ince I am not in|formed
for what purpo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will not pre&s;s you to go,&endq; &s;aid Vi|valdi;
&startq;my purpo&s;e is already known to
you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Have you really failed to di&s;cover the
&s;tranger&mdash;have you &s;till doubts concerning
the per&s;on you pur&s;ued?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="47" REF="58">
&startq;I have doubts, which to-morrow night,
I hope, will di&s;&s;ipate.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is very &s;trange!&endq; &s;aid Bonarmo,
&startq;It was but now that I witne&s;&s;ed the hor|ror,
with which you left the fortre&s;s of
Paluzzi, and already you &s;peak of returning
to it! And why at night&mdash;why not in the
day, when le&s;s danger would be&s;et you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know not as to that,&endq; replied Vivaldi,
&startq;you are to ob&s;erve that day-light never
pierces within the rece&s;s, to which I pene|trated;
we mu&s;t &s;earch the place with
torches at what&s;oever hour we would ex|amine
it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Since this is nece&s;&s;ary,&endq; &s;aid Bonarmo,
&startq;how happens it that you found your way
in total darkne&s;s?&endq;.</P>
<P>&startq;I was too much engaged to know how;
I was led on, as by an invi&s;ible hand.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We mu&s;t, notwith&s;tanding,&endq; ob&s;erved
Bonarmo, &startq;go in day-time, if not by day|light,
provided I accompany you. It would
be little le&s;s than in&s;anity to go twice to a
place, which is probably infe&s;ted with
<PB N="48" REF="59">
robbers, and at their own hour of mid|night.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;hall watch again in the accu&s;tomed
place,&endq; replied Vivaldi, &startq;before I u&s;e my
la&s;t re&s;ource, and this cannot be done du|ring
the day. Be&s;ides, it is nece&s;&s;ary that I
&s;hould go at a particular hour, the hour
when the monk has u&s;ually appeared.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He did e&s;cape you, then?&endq; &s;aid Bonar|mo,
&startq;and you are &s;till ignorant concerning
who he is?&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi rejoined only with an enquiry
whether his friend would accompany him.
&startq;If not,&endq; he added, &startq;I mu&s;t hope to find
another companion.&endq;</P>
<P>Bonarmo &s;aid, that he mu&s;t con&s;ider of
the propo&s;al, and would acquaint him with
his determination before the following
evening.</P>
<P>While this conver&s;ation concluded, they
were in Naples, and at the gates of the
Vivaldi palace, where they &s;eparated for the

<BIBL>TWELFTH NIGHT.</BIBL></Q>
<P>SINCE Vivaldi had failed to procure an
explanation of the words of the monk, he
determined to relieve him&s;elf from the tor|tures
of &s;u&s;pence, re&s;pecting a rival, by
going to the villa Altieri, and declaring his
preten&s;ions. On the morning immediately
following his late adventure, he went thither,
and on enquiring for Signora Bianchi, was
told that &s;he could not be &s;een. With
much difficulty he prevailed upon the old
<PB N="50" REF="61">
hou&s;e-keeper to deliver a reque&s;t that he
might be permitted to wait upon her for
a few moments. Permi&s;&s;ion was granted
him, when he was conducted into the very
apartment where he had formerly &s;een
Ellena. It was unoccupied and he was
told that Signora Bianchi would be there
pre&s;ently.</P>
<P>During this interval, he was agitated at
one moment with quick impatience, and at
another with enthu&s;ia&s;tic plea&s;ure, while he
gazed on the altar whence he had &s;een
Ellena ri&s;e, and where, to his fancy, &s;he
&s;till appeared; and on every object, on
which he knew her eyes had lately dwelt.
The&s;e objects, &s;o familiar to her, had in,
the imagination of Vivaldi acquired &s;ome|what
of the &s;acred character &s;he had im|pre&s;&s;ed
upon his heart, and affected him in
&s;ome degree as her pre&s;ence would have
done. He trembled as he took up the lute
&s;he had been accu&s;tomed to touch, and,
when he awakened the chords, her own
voice &s;eemed to &s;peak. A drawing, half
<PB N="51" REF="62">
fini&s;hed, of a dancing nymph remained on
a &s;tand, and he immediately under&s;tood that
her hand had traced the lines. It was a
copy from Herculaneum, and, though a
copy, was touched with the &s;pirit of origi|nal
genius. The light &s;teps appeared al|mo&s;t
to move, and the whole figure di&s;|played
the airy lightne&s;s of exqui&s;ite grace.
Vivaldi perceived this to be one of a &s;et
that ornamented the apartment, and ob|&s;erved
with &s;urpri&s;e, that they were the
particular &s;ubjects, which adorned his fa|ther's
cabinet, and which he had under&s;tood
to be the only copies permitted from the
originals in the royal mu&s;eum.</P>
<P>Every object, on which his eyes re&s;ted,
&s;eemed to announce the pre&s;ence of Ellena;
and the very flowers that &s;o gaily embelli&s;h|ed
the apartment, breathed forth a perfume,
which fa&s;cinated his &s;en&s;es and affected his
imagination. Before Signora Bianchi ap|peared,
his anxiety and apprehen&s;ion had
encrea&s;ed &s;o much, that, believing he &s;hould
be unable to &s;upport him&s;elf in her pre|fence
<PB N="52" REF="63">
he was more than once upon the
point of leaving the hou&s;e. At length, he
heard her approaching &s;tep from the hall,
and his breath almo&s;t for&s;ook him. The
figure of Signora Bianchi was not of an
order to in&s;pire admiration, and a &s;pecta|tor
might have &s;miled to &s;ee the perturba|tion
of Vivaldi, his faultering &s;tep and
anxious eye, as he advanced to meet the
venerable Bianchi, as he bowed upon her
faded hand, and li&s;tened to her querulous
voice. She received him with an air of
re&s;erve, and &s;ome moments pa&s;&s;ed before
he could recollect him&s;elf &s;ufficiently to
explain the purpo&s;e of his vi&s;it; yet this,
when, he di&s;covered it, did not apparently
&s;urpri&s;e her. She li&s;tened with compo&s;ure,
though with &s;omewhat of a &s;evere counte|nance,
to his prote&s;tations of regard for her
niece, and when he implored her to inter|cede
for him in obtaining the hand of
Ellena, &s;he &s;aid, &startq;I cannot be ignorant
that a family of your rank mu&s;t be aver&s;e to
an union with one ofmine; nor am I unac|quainted
<PB N="53" REF="64">
that a full &s;en&s;e of the value of
birth is a marking feature in the characters
of the Marche&s;e and Marche&s;a di Vivaldi.
This propo&s;al mu&s;t be di&s;agreeable or, at
lea&s;t, unknown to them; and I am to in|form
you, Signor, that, though Signora di
Ro&s;alba is their inferior in rank, &s;he is
their equal in pride.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi di&s;dained to prevaricate, yet was
&s;hocked to own the truth thus abruptly.
The ingenuous manner, however, with
which he at length did this, and the energy
of a pa&s;&s;ion too eloquent to be mi&s;under|&s;tood,
&s;omewhat &s;oothed the anxiety of
Signora Bianchi, with whom other con&s;i|derations
began to ari&s;e. She con&s;idered
that from her own age and infirmities &s;he
mu&s;t very &s;oon, in the cour&s;e of nature,
leave Ellena a young and friendle&s;s orphan;
&s;till &s;omewhat dependent upon her own in|du&s;try,
and entirely &s;o on her di&s;cretion.
With much beauty and little knowledge of
the world, the dangers of her future &s;itua|tion
appeared in vivid colours to the affec|tionate
<PB N="54" REF="65">
mind of Signora Bianchi; and &s;he
&s;ometimes thought that it might be right
to &s;acrifice con&s;iderations, which in other
circum&s;tances would be laudable, to the
obtaining for her niece the protection of
a hu&s;band and a man of honour. If in
this in&s;tance she de&s;cended from the lofty
integrity, which ought to have oppo&s;ed her
con&s;ent that Ellena &s;hould clande&s;tinely
enter any family, her parental anxiety may
&s;often the cen&s;ure &s;he de&s;erved.</P>
<P>But, before &s;he determined upon this
&s;ubject, it was nece&s;&s;ary to a&s;certain that
Vivaldi was worthy of the con&s;idence &s;he
might repo&s;e in him. To try, al&s;o, the
con&s;tancy of his affection, &s;he gave little
pre&s;ent encouragement to his hopes. His
reque&s;t to &s;ee Ellena &s;he ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed,
till &s;he &s;hould have con&s;idered further of
his propo&s;als; and his enquiry whether he
had a rival, and, if he had, whether Ellena
was di&s;po&s;ed to favour him, &s;he evaded,
&s;ince &s;he knew that a reply would give
<PB N="55" REF="66">
more encouragement to his hopes, than it
might hereafter be proper to confirm.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, at length, took his leave, re|lea&s;ed,
indeed, from ab&s;olute de&s;pair, but
&s;carcely encouraged to hope; ignorant that
he had a rival, yet doubtful whether Ellena
honoured him&s;elf with any &s;hare of her
e&s;teem.</P>
<P>He had received permi&s;&s;ion to wait upon
Signora Bianchi on a future day, but till
that day should arrive time appeared mo|tionle&s;s;
and, &s;ince it &s;eemed utterly im|po&s;&s;ible
to endure this interval of &s;u&s;pence,
his thoughts on the way to Naples were
wholy engaged in contriving the means of
concluding it, till he reached the well|known
arch, and looked round, though
hopele&s;sly, for his my&s;terious tormentor.
The &s;tranger did not appear; and Vivaldi
pur&s;ued the road, determined to re-vi&s;it the
&s;pot at night, and al&s;o to return privately
to villa Altieri, where he hoped a &s;econd
vi&s;it might procure for him &s;ome relief
from his pre&s;ent anxiety.</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="67">
When he reached home he found that
the Marche&s;e, his father, had left an order
for him to await his arrival; which he
obeyed; but the day pa&s;&s;ed without his
return. The Marche&s;a, when &s;he &s;aw him,
enquired, with a look that expre&s;&s;ed much,
how he had engaged him&s;elf of late, and
completely fru&s;trated his plans for the
evening, by requiring him to attend her
to Portici. Thus he was prevented from
receiving Bonarmo's determination, from
watching at Paluzzi, and from revi&s;iting
Ellena's re&s;idence.</P>
<P>He remained at Portici the following
evening, and, on his return to Naples, the
Marche&s;e being again ab&s;ent, he continued
ignorant of the intended &s;ubject of the in|terview.
A note from Bonarmo brought
a refu&s;al to accompany him to the fortre&s;s,
and urged him to forbear &s;o dangerous a
vi&s;it. Being for this night unprovided with
a companion for the adventure, and un|willing
to go alone, Vivaldi deferred it to
another evening; but no con&s;ideration
<PB N="57" REF="68">
could deter him from vi&s;iting the villa Altieri.
Not chu&s;ing to &s;olicit his friend to accom|pany
him thither, &s;ince he had refu&s;ed his
fir&s;t reque&s;t, he took his &s;olitary lute, and
reached the garden at an earlier hour than
u&s;ual.</P>
<P>The &s;un had been &s;et above an hour, but
the horizon &s;till retained &s;omewhat of a &s;af|fron
brilliancy, and the whole dome of the
&s;ky had an appearance of tran&s;parency, pe|culiar
to this enchanting climate, which
&s;eemed to diffu&s;e a more &s;oothing twilight
over the repo&s;ing world. In the &s;outh-ea&s;t
the outline of Ve&s;uvius appeared di&s;tinctly,
but the mountain it&s;elf was dark and &s;ilent.</P>
<P>Vivaldi heard only the quick and eager
voices of &s;ome Lazaroni at a di&s;tance on the
&s;hore, as they contended at the &s;imple game
of maro. From the bowery lattices of a
&s;mall pavilion within the orangery, he per|ceived
a light, and the &s;udden hope, which
it occa&s;ioned, of &s;eeing Ellena, almo&s;t over|came
him. It was impo&s;&s;ible to re&s;i&s;t the
opportunity of beholding her, yet he check|ed
<PB N="58" REF="69">
the impatient &s;tep he was taking, to a&s;k
him&s;elf, whether it was honorable thus to
&s;teal upon her retirement, and become an
un&s;u&s;pected ob&s;erver of her &s;ecret thoughts.
But the temptation was too powerful for
this honorable he&s;itation; the pau&s;e was
momentary; and, &s;tepping lightly towards
the pavilion, he placed him&s;elf near an open
lattice, &s;o as to be &s;hrouded from ob&s;erva|tion
by the branches of an orange-tree,
while he obtained a full view of the apart|ment.
Ellena was alone, &s;itting in a
thoughtful attitude and holding her lute,
which &s;he did not play. She appeared lo&s;t
to a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of &s;urrounding objects,
and a tenderne&s;s was on her-countenance,
which &s;eemed to tell him that her thoughts
were engaged by &s;ome intere&s;ting &s;ubject.
Recollecting that, when la&s;t he had &s;een her
thus, &s;he pronounced his name, his hope
revived, and he was going to di&s;cover him|&s;elf
and appear at her feet, when &s;he &s;poke,
and he pau&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="59" REF="70">
&startq;Why this unrea&s;onable pride of birth!&endq;
&s;aid &s;he; &startq;A vi&s;ionary prejudice de&s;troys
our peace. Never would I &s;ubmit to enter
a family aver&s;e to receive me, they &s;hall
learn, at lea&s;t, that I inherit nobility of &s;oul.
O! Vivaldi! but for this unhappy preju|dice!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, while he li&s;tened to this, was im|movable;
he &s;eemed as if entranced; the
&s;ound of her lute and voice recalled him,
and he heard her &s;ing the fir&s;t &s;tanza of the
very air, with which he had opened the &s;e|renade
on a former night, and with &s;uch
&s;weet pathos as the compo&s;er mu&s;t have felt
when he was in&s;pired with the idea.</P>
<P>She pau&s;ed at the conclu&s;ion of the $ir&s;t
&s;tanza, when Vivaldi, overcome by the
temptation of &s;uch an opportunity for ex|pre&s;&s;ing
his pa&s;&s;ion, &s;uddenly &s;truck the
chords of the lute, and replied to her in the
&s;econd. The tremor of his voice, though
it re&s;trained his tones, heightened its elo|quence.
Ellena in&s;tantly recollected it;
her colour alternately faded and returned;
<PB N="60" REF="71">
and, before the ver&s;e concluded, &s;he &s;eemed
to have lo&s;t all con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s. Vivaldi was
now advancing into the pavilion, when his
approach recalled her; &s;he waved him to
retire, and before he could &s;pring to her &s;up|port,
&s;he ro&s;e and would have left the place,
had he not interrupted her and implored a
few moments attention.</P>
<P>&startq;It is impo&s;&s;ible,&endq; &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;Let me only hear you &s;ay that I am not
hateful to you,&endq; rejoined Vivaldi; &startq;that
this intru&s;ion has not deprived me of the
regard, with which but now you acknow|ledged
you honoured me.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Oh, never, never!&endq; interrupted Ellena,
impatiently; &startq;forget that I ever made &s;uch
acknowledgment; forget that you ever
heard it; I know not what I &s;aid.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, beautiful Ellena! do you think it
po&s;&s;ible I ever can forget it? It will be the
&s;olace of my &s;olitary hours, the hope that
&s;hall &s;u&s;tain me.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot be detained Signor,&endq; inter|rupted
Ellena, &s;till more embarra&s;&s;ed, &startq;or
<PB N="61" REF="72">
forgive my&s;elf for having permitted &s;uch a
conver&s;ation;&endq; but as &s;he &s;poke the la&s;t
words, an involuntary &s;mile &s;eemed to con|tradict
their meaning. Vivaldi believed the
&s;mile in &s;pite of the words; but, before he
could expre&s;s the lightning joy of convic|tion,
&s;he had left the pavilion; he followed
through the garden&mdash;but &s;he was gone.</P>
<P>From this moment Vivaldi &s;eemed to have
ari&s;en into a new exi&s;tenee; the whole world
to him was Paradi&s;e; that &s;mile &s;eemed im|pre&s;&s;ed
upon his heart for ever. In the
fulnefs of pre&s;ent joy, he believed it impo&s;|&s;ible
that he could ever be unhappy again,
and defied the utmo&s;t malice of future for|tune.
With foot&s;teps light as air, he re|turned
to Naples, nor once remembered to
look for his old monitor on the way.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e and his mother being from
home, he was left at his lei&s;ure to indulge
the rapturous recollection, that pre&s;&s;ed
upon his mind, and of which he was impa|tient
of a moment's interruption. All night
he either traver&s;ed his apartment with an
<PB N="62" REF="73">
agitation equal to that, which anxiety had &s;o
lately inflicted, or compo&s;ed and de&s;troyed
letters to Ellena; &s;ometimes fearing that
he had written too much, and at others
feeling that he had written too little; re|collecting
circum&s;tances which he ought to
have mentioned, and lamenting the cold
expre&s;&s;ion of a pa&s;&s;ion, to which it appeared
that no language could do ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>By the hour when the dome&s;tics had
ri&s;en, he had, however, completed a letter
&s;omewhat more to his &s;atisfaction, and he
di&s;patched it to the villa Altieri by a con|fidential
per&s;on; but the &s;ervant had
&s;carcely quitted the gates, when he recol|lected
new arguments, which he wi&s;hed to
urge, and expre&s;&s;ons to change of the ut|mo&s;t
importance to enforce his meaning,
and he would have given half the world to
have recalled the me&s;&s;enger.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of agitation he was $ummon|ed
to attend the Marche&s;e, who had been
too much engaged of late to keep his own
appointment. Vivaldi was not long in
<PB N="63" REF="74">
doubt as to the &s;ubject of this inter|view.</P>
<P>&startq;I have wi&s;hed to &s;peak with you,&endq; &s;aid
the Marche&s;e, a&s;&s;uming an air of haughty
&s;everity, &startq;upon a &s;ubject of the utmo&s;t
importance to your honour and happine&s;s;
and I wi&s;hed, al&s;o, to give you an opportu|nity
of contradicting a report, which would
have occa&s;ioned me con&s;iderable unea&s;ine&s;s,
if I could have believed it. Happily I had
too much confidence in my &s;on to credit
this; and I affirmed that he under&s;tood too
well what was due both to his family and
him&s;elf, to take any &s;tep derogatory from
the dignity of either. My motive for this
conver&s;ation, therefore, is merely to afford
you a moment for refuting the calumny I
&s;hall mention, and to obtain for my&s;elf au|thority
for contradicting it to the per&s;ons
who have communicated it to me.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi waited impatiently for the con|clu&s;ion
of this exordium, and then begged
to be informed of the &s;ubject of the re|port.</P>
<P><PB N="64" REF="75">
&startq;It is &s;aid,&endq; re&s;umed the Marche&s;e,
that there is a young woman, who is
called Ellena Ro&s;alba,&mdash;I think that is the
name;&mdash;do you know any per&s;on of the
name?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do I know!&endq; exclaimed Vivaldi, &startq;but
pardon me, pray proceed, my Lord.&endq;</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e pau&s;ed, and regarded his
&s;on with &s;ternne&s;s, but without &s;urprize.
&startq;It is &s;aid, that a young per&s;on of this
name has contrived to fa&s;cinate your affec|tions,

<P>&startq;It is mo&s;t true, my Lord, that Signora

Vivaldi with hone&s;t impatience, &startq;but
without contrivance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will not be interrupted,&endq; &s;aid the
Marche&s;e, interrupting in his turn. &startq;It is
&s;aid that me has &s;o artfully adapted her
temper to yours, that, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
a relation who lives with her, &s;he has re|duced

&startq;Signora Ro&s;alba has, my Lord, ex|alted

feelings. He was proceeding, when the
Marche&s;e abruptly checked him, &startq;You
avow your folly then!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My Lord, I glory in my choice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Young man,&endq; rejoined his father, &startq;as
this is the arrogance and romantic enthu|&s;ia&s;m

the Marche&s;e with &s;terner empha&s;is;
&startq;and, to prove that I am more merciful
than ju&s;t, I am willing, on this condition,
to allow her a &s;mall annuity as &s;ome repa|ration
for the depravity, into which you
have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to &s;ink her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My Lord!&endq; exclaimed Vivaldi agha&s;t,
and &s;carcely daring to tru&s;t his voice, &startq;my
Lord!&mdash;depravity?&endq; &s;truggling for breath.
<PB N="66" REF="77">
&startq;Who has dared to pollute her &s;potle&s;s

him his reward. Depravity!&mdash;an annuity&mdash;an
annuity! O Ellena! Ellena!&endq; As he
pronounced her name tears of tenderne&s;s
mingled with tho&s;e of indignation.</P>
<P>&startq;Young man,&endq; &s;aid the Marche&s;e, who
had ob&s;erved the violence of his emotion
with &s;trong di&s;plea&s;ure and alarm, &startq;I do
not lightly give faith to report, and I can|not
&s;uffer my&s;elf to doubt the truth of what
I have advanced. You are deceived, and
your vanity will continue the delu&s;ion, un|le&s;s
I conde&s;cend to exert my authority,

former character which will &s;tagger even

<P>&startq;Di&s;mi&s;s her!&endq; repeated; Vivaldi, with
calm yet &s;tern energy, &s;uch as his father
had never &s;een him a&s;&s;ume; &startq;My Lord,
you have never yet doubted my word, and

I now pledge you that honourable word,

be nece&s;&s;ary for me to vindicate her!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t indeed lament that it ever
&s;hould,&endq; replied the Marche&s;e coldly.
&startq;You have pledged your word, which I
cannot que&s;tion. I believe, therefore, that
you are deceived; that you think her vir|tuous,
notwith&s;tanding your midnight vi&s;its

&s;tained her character? What&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;By proclaiming to the world, my Lord,
that &s;he is worthy of becoming my wife,&endq;
replied Vivaldi, with a glow of countenance,
which announced the courage and the ex|ultation
of a virtuous mind.</P>
<P>&startq;Your wife!&endq; &s;aid the Marche&s;e, with
a look of ineffable di&s;dain, which was in|&s;tantly
&s;ucceeded by one of angry alarm.&mdash;&startq;If

<P>&startq;O! why,&endq; exclaimed Vivaldi, in an
agony of conflicting pa&s;&s;ions, &startq;why &s;hould
I be in danger of forgetting what is due to
a father, when I am only a&s;&s;erting what is
due to innocence; when I am only defend|ing
her, who has no other to defend her!
Why may not I be permitted to reconcile
duties &s;o congenial! But, be the event what
it may, I will defend the oppre&s;&s;ed, and
glory in the virtue, which teaches me, that
it is the fir&s;t duty of humanity to do &s;o.
Yes, my Lord, if it mu&s;t be &s;o, I am ready
to &s;acrifice inferior duties to the grandeur of

<P>&startq;Where is the principle,&endq; &s;aid the Mar|che&s;e,
impatiently, &startq;which &s;hall teach you
to di&s;obey a father; where is the virtue
which &s;hall in&s;truct you to degrade your

<P><PB N="69" REF="80">
&startq;There can be no degradation, my

&startq;and there are in&s;tances, pardon me,
my Lord, there are &s;ome few in&s;tances in
which it is virtuous to di&s;obey.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This paradoxical morality,&endq; &s;aid the
Marche&s;e, with pa&s;&s;ionate di&s;plea&s;ure, &startq;and
this romantic language, &s;ufficiently explain
to me the character of your a&s;&s;ociates, and
the innocence of her, whom you defend
with &s;o chivalric an air. Are you to learn,
Signor, that you belong to your family, not
your family to you; that you are only a
guardian of its honour, and not at liberty
to di&s;po&s;e of your&s;elf? My patience will en|dure
no more!&endq;</P>
<P>Nor could the patience of Vivaldi endure
this repeated attack on the honor of Ellena.
But, while he yet a&s;&s;erted her innocence,
he endeavoured to do &s;o with the temper,
which was due to the pre&s;ence of a father;
and, though he maintained the indepen|dence
of a man, he was equally anxious to
pre&s;erve inviolate the duties of a &s;on. But
<PB N="70" REF="81">
unfortunately the Marche&s;e and Vivaldi dif|fered
in opinion concerning the limits of
the&s;e duties; the fir&s;t extending them to
pa&s;&s;ive obedience, and the latter conceiving
them to conclude at a point, wherein the
happine&s;s of an individual is &s;o deeply con|cerned
as in marriage. They parted mutually
inflamed; Vivaldi unable to prevail
with his father to mention the name of his
infamous informant, or to acknowledge
him&s;elf convinced of Ellena's innocence;
and the Marche&s;e equally un&s;ucce&s;sful in
his endeavours to obtain from his &s;on a pro|mi&s;e
that he would &s;ee her no more.</P>
<P>Here then was Vivaldi, who only a few
&s;hort hours before had experienced a happi|ne&s;s
&s;o &s;upreme as to efface all impre&s;&s;ions
of the pa&s;t, and to annihilate every con&s;i|deration
of the future; a joy &s;o full that it
permitted him not to believe it po&s;&s;ible that
he could ever again ta&s;te of mi&s;ery; he,
who had felt as if that moment was as an
eternity, rendering him independent of all
others,&mdash;even he was thus &s;oon fallen
<PB N="71" REF="82">
into the region of time and of &s;uffer|ing.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent conflict of pa&s;&s;ion appeared
endle&s;s; he loved his father, and would have
been more &s;hocked to con&s;ider the vexation
he was preparing for him, had he not been
re&s;entful of the contempt he expre&s;&s;ed for
Ellena. He adored Ellena; and, while he
felt the impractability of re&s;igning his hopes,
was equally indignant of the &s;lander, which
affected her name, and impatient to avenge
the in&s;ult upon the original defamer.</P>
<P>Though the di&s;plea&s;ure of his father con|cerning
a marriage with Ellena had been
already fore&s;een, the experience of it was
&s;everer and more painful than he had ima|gined;
while the indignity offered to Ellena
was as unexpected as intolerable. But this
circum&s;tance furni&s;hed him with an addi|tional
argument for addre&s;&s;ing her; for, if it
had been po&s;&s;ible that his love could have
pau&s;ed, his honour &s;eemed now engaged in
her behalf; and, &s;ince he had been a means
of &s;ullying her fame, it became his duty to
<PB N="72" REF="83">
re&s;tore it. Willingly li&s;tening to the dic|tates
of a duty &s;o plau&s;ible, he determined
to per&s;evere in his original de&s;ign. But his
fir&s;t efforts were directed to di&s;cover her
&s;landerer, and recollecting, with &s;urprize,
tho&s;e words of the Marche&s;e, which had
confe&s;&s;ed a knowledge of his evening vi&s;its
to the villa Altieri, the doubtful warnings of
the monk &s;eemed explained. He believed
that this man was at once, the &s;py of his
&s;teps, and the defamer of his love, till the
incon&s;i&s;tency of &s;uch conduct with the
&s;eeming friendline&s;s of his admonitions,
&s;truck Vivaldi and compelled him to believe
the contrary.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the heart of Ellena had been
little le&s;s tranquil. It was divided by love
and pride; but had &s;he been acquainted
with the circum&s;tances of the late interview
between the Marche&s;e and Vivaldi, it would
have been divided no longer, and a ju&s;t
regard for her own dignity would in&s;tantly
have taught her to &s;ubdue, without diffi|culty,
this infant affection.</P>
<P><PB N="73" REF="84">
Signora Bianchi had informed her niece
of the &s;ubject of Vivaldi's vi&s;it; but &s;he
had, &s;oftened the objectionable circum|&s;tances
that attended his propo&s;al, and had,
at fir&s;t, merely hinted that it was not to be
&s;uppo&s;ed his family would approve a con|nection
with any per&s;on &s;o much their in|ferior
in rank as her&s;elf. Ellena, alarmed
by this &s;ugge&s;tion, replied, that, &s;ince &s;he
believed &s;o, &s;he had done right to reject
Vivaldi's &s;uit; but her &s;igh, as &s;he &s;aid this,
did not e&s;cape the ob&s;ervation of Signora
Bianchi, who ventured to add, that &s;he had
not <HI>ab&s;olutely</HI> rejected his offers.</P>
<P>While in this and future conver&s;ations,
Ellena was plea&s;ed to perceive her &s;ecret
admiration thus ju&s;tified by an approbation
&s;o indi&s;putable as that of her aunt, and
was willing to believe that the circum|&s;tance,
which had alarmed her ju&s;t pride, was
not &s;o humiliating as &s;he at fir&s;t imagined,
Bianchi was careful to conceal the real con|&s;iderations,
which had induced her to li&s;ten
to Vivaldi, being well a&s;&s;ured that they
<PB N="74" REF="85">
would have no weight with Ellena, who&s;e
generous heart and inexperienced mind
would have revolted from mingling any
motives of intere&s;t with an engagement &s;o
&s;acred as that of marriage. When, how|ever,
from further deliberation upon the
advantages, which &s;uch an alliance mu&s;t
&s;ecure for her niece, Signora Bianchi de|termined
to encourage his views, and to
direct the mind of Ellena, who&s;e affections
were already engaged on her &s;ide, the opi|nions
of the latter were found le&s;s ductile
than had been expected. She was &s;hocked at
the idea of entering clande&s;tinely the family of
Vivaldi. But Bianchi, who&s;e infirmities urg|ed
her wi&s;hes, was now &s;o &s;trongly convinced
of the prudence of &s;uch an engagement for
her niece, that me determined to prevail
over her reluctance, though &s;he perceived
that this mu&s;t be by means more gradual
and per&s;ua&s;ive than &s;he had believed nece&s;|&s;ary.
On the evening, when Vivaldi had
&s;urpri&s;ed from Ellena an acknowledgment
of her &s;entiments, her embarra&s;&s;ment and
<PB N="75" REF="86">
vexation, on her returning to the hou&s;e,
and-relating what had occurred, &s;ufficiently
expre&s;&s;ed to Signora Bianchi the exact
&s;ituation of her heart. And when, on the
following morning, his letter arrived, writ|ten
with the &s;implicity and energy of truth,
the aunt neglected not to adapt her remarks
upon it, to the character of Ellena, with
her u&s;ual addre&s;s.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, after the late interview with the
Marche&s;e, pa&s;&s;ed the remainder of the day
in con&s;idering various plans, which might
di&s;cover to him the per&s;on, who had abu&s;ed
the credulity of his father; and in the
evening he returned once more to the villa
Altieri, not in &s;ecret, to &s;erenade the dark
balcony of his mi&s;tre&s;s, but openly, and to
conver&s;e with Signora Bianchi, who now
received him more courteou&s;ly than on his
former vi&s;it. Attributing the anxiety in his
countenance to the uncertainty, concerning
the di&s;po&s;ition of her niece, &s;he was neither
&s;urpri&s;ed or offended, but ventured to re|lieve
him from a part of it, by encouraging
<PB N="76" REF="87">
his hopes. Vivaldi dreaded le&s;t &s;he &s;hould
enquire further re&s;pecting the &s;entiments of
his family, but &s;he &s;pared both his delicacy
and her own on this point; and, after a
conver&s;ation of con&s;iderable length, he left
the villa Altieri with a heart &s;omewhat
&s;oothed by approbation, and lightened by
hope, although he had not obtained a &s;ight
of Ellena. The di&s;clo&s;ure &s;he had made of
her &s;entiments on the preceding evening,
and the hints &s;he had received as to tho&s;e
of his family, &s;till wrought upon her mind
with too much effect to permit an inter|view.</P>
<P>Soon after his return to Naples, the
Marche&s;a, whom he was &s;urpri&s;ed to find
di&s;engaged, &s;ent for him to her clo&s;et,
where a &s;cene pa&s;&s;ed &s;imilar to that which
had occurred with his father, except
that the Marche&s;a was more dexter|ous
in her que&s;tions, and more &s;ubtle in
her whole conduct; and that Vivaldi,
never for a moment, forgot the decorum
which was due to a mother. Managing
<PB N="77" REF="88">
his pa&s;&s;ions, rather than exa&s;perating them,
and deceiving him with re&s;pect to the de|gree
of re&s;entment &s;he felt from his choice,
&s;he was le&s;s pa&s;&s;ionate than the Marche&s;e
in her ob&s;ervations and menaces, perhaps,
only becau&s;e &s;he entertained more hope
than he did of preventing the evil me con|templated.</P>
<P>Vivaldi quitted her, unconvinced-by her
arguments, un&s;ubdued by her prophecies,
and unmoved in his de&s;igns. He was not
alarmed, becau&s;e he did not &s;uffciently un|der&s;tand
her character to apprehend her
purpo&s;es. De&s;pairing to effect the&s;e by
open violence, &s;he called in an auxiliary of
no mean talents, and who&s;e character and
views well adapted him to be an in&s;trument
in her hands. It was, perhaps, the ba&s;e|ne&s;s
of her own heart, not either depth of
reflexion or keenne&s;s of penetration, which
enabled her to under&s;tand the nature of
his; and &s;he determined to modulate that
nature to her own views.</P>
<P><PB N="78" REF="89">
There lived in the Dominican convent
of the Spirito Santo, at Naples, a man
called father Schedoni; an Italian, as his
name imported, but who&s;e family was un|known,
and from &s;ome circum&s;tances, it
appeared, that he wi&s;hed to throw an im|penetrable
veil over his origin. For what|ever
rea&s;on, he was never heard to mention
a relative, or the place of his nativity, and
he had artfully eluded every enquiry that
approached the &s;ubject, which the curio&s;ity
of his a&s;&s;ociates had occa&s;ionally prompted.
There were circum&s;tances, however, which
appeared to indicate him to be a man of
birth, and of fallen fortune; his &s;pirit, as
it had &s;ometimes looked forth from under
the di&s;gui&s;e of his manners, &s;eemed lofty;
it &s;hewed not, however, the a&s;pirings of a
generous mind, but rather the gloomy
pride of a di&s;appointed one. Some few
per&s;ons in the convent, who had been in|tere&s;ted
by his appearance, believed that
the peculiarities of his manners, his &s;evere
re&s;erve and unconquerable &s;ilence, his &s;o|litary
<PB N="79" REF="90">
habits and frequent penances, were
the effect of misfortunes preying upon a
haughty and di&s;ordered &s;pirit; while others
conjectured them the con&s;equence of &s;ome
hideous crime gnawing upon an awaken|ed
con&s;cience.</P>
<P>He would &s;ometimes ab&s;tract him&s;elf from
the &s;ociety for whole days together, or when
with &s;uch a di&s;po&s;ition he was compelled
to mingle with it, he &s;eemed uncon&s;cious
where he was, and continued &s;hrouded in
meditation and &s;ilence till he was again
alone. There were times when it was un|known
whither he had retired, notwith|&s;tanding
that his &s;teps had been watched,
and his cu&s;tomary haunts examined. No
one ever heard him complain. The elder
brothers of the convent &s;aid that he had
talents, but denied him learning; they ap|plauded
him for the profound &s;ubtlety
which he occa&s;ionally di&s;covered in argu|ment,
but ob&s;erved that he &s;eldom per|ceived
truth when it lay on the &s;urface;
he could follow it through all the labyrinths
<PB N="80" REF="91">
of di&s;qui&s;ition, but overlooked it, when it
was undi&s;gui&s;ed before him. In fact he
cared not for truth, nor &s;ought it by bold
and broad argument, but loved to exert the
wily cunning of his nature in hunting it
through artificial perplexities. At length,
from a habit of intricacy and &s;u&s;picion, his
vitiated mind could receive nothing for
truth, which was &s;imple and ea&s;ily compre|hended.</P>
<P>Among his a&s;&s;ociates no one loved him,
many di&s;liked him, and more feared him.
His figure was &s;triking, but not &s;o from
grace; it was tall, and, though extremely
thin, his limbs were large and uncouth, and
as he &s;talked along, wrapt in the black gar|ments
of his order, there was &s;omething
terrible in its air; &s;omething almo&s;t &s;uper|human.
His cowl, too, as it threw a &s;hade
over the livid palene&s;s of his face, encrea&s;|ed
its &s;evere character, and gave an effect
to his large melancholy eye, which ap|proached
to horror. His was not the me|lancholy
of a &s;en&s;ible and wounded heart,
<PB N="81" REF="92">
but apparently that of a gloomy and &s;ero|cious
di&s;po&s;ition. There was &s;omething in
his phy&s;iognomy extremely &s;ingular, and
that can not ea&s;ily be defined. It bore the
traces of many pa&s;&s;ions, which &s;eemed to
have fixed the features they no longer ani|mated.
An habitual gloom and &s;everity
prevailed over the deep lines of his coun|tenance;
and his eyes were &s;o piercing that
they $eemed to penetrate, at a &s;ingle glance
into the hearts of men, and to read their
mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts; few per&s;ons could
&s;upport their &s;crutiny, or even endure to
meet them twice. Yet, notwithstanding
all this gloom and au&s;terity, &s;ome rare oc|ca&s;ions
of intere&s;t had called forth a charac|ter
upon his countenance entirely different;
and he could adapt him&s;elf to the tempers
and pa&s;&s;ions of per&s;ons, whom he wi&s;hed
to conciliate, with a&s;toni&s;hing facility, and
generally with complete triumph. This monk,
this Schedoni, was the confe&s;&s;or and &s;ecret
advi&s;er of the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi. In the
fir&s;t efferve&s;cence of pride and indignation,
<PB N="82" REF="93">
which the di&s;covery of her &s;on's intended
marriage occa&s;ioned, &s;he con&s;ulted him on
the means of preventing it, and &s;he &s;oon
perceived that his talents promi&s;ed to equal
her wi&s;hes. Each po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, in a con&s;ider|able
degree, the power of a&s;&s;i&s;ting the
other; Schedoni had &s;ubtlety with ambi|tion
to urge it; and the Marche&s;a had in|exorable
pride, and courtly influence; the
one hoped to obtain a high benefice for his
&s;ervices, and the other to &s;ecure the ima|ginary
dignity of her hou&s;e, by her gifts.
Prompted by &s;uch pa&s;&s;ions, and allured by
&s;uch views, they concerted in private, and
unknown even to the Marche&s;e, the means
of accompli&s;hing their general end.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, as he quitted his mother's clo&s;et,
had met Schedoni in the corridor leading
thither. He knew him to be her confe&s;&s;or,
and was not much &s;urpri&s;ed to &s;ee him,
though the hour was an unu&s;ual one.
Schedoni bowed his head, as he pa&s;&s;ed, and
a&s;&s;umed a meek and holy countenance; but
Vivaldi, as he eyed him with a penetrating
<PB N="83" REF="94">
glance, now recoiled with involuntary emo|tion;
and it &s;eemed as if a &s;huddering pre|&s;entiment
of what this monk was preparing
for him, had cro&s;&s;ed his mind.</P>

<P>VIVALDI, from the period of his la&s;t
vi&s;it to Altieri, was admitted a frequent vi|&s;itor
to Signora Bianchi, and Ellena was,
at length, prevailed upon to join the party,
when the conver&s;ation was always on indifferent
topics. Bianchi, under&s;tanding the
di&s;po&s;ition of her niece's affections, and the
accompli&s;hed mind and manners of Vivaldi,
judged that he was more likely to &s;ucceed
by &s;ilent attentions than by a formal decla|rtion
of his &s;entiments. By &s;uch declara|tion,
Ellena, till her heart was more en|gaged
in his cau&s;e, would, perhaps, have
been alarmed into an ab&s;olute rejection of his
addre&s;&s;es, and this was every day le&s;s likely
<PB N="85" REF="96">
to happen, &s;o long as he had an opportu|nity
of conver&s;ing with her.</P>
<P>Signora Bianchi had acknowledged to
Vivaldi that he had no rival to apprehend;
that Ellena had uniformly rejected every
admirer who had hitherto di&s;covered her
within the &s;hade of her retirement, and that
her pre&s;ent re&s;erve proceeded more from
con&s;iderations of the &s;entiments of his fa|mily
than from di&s;approbation of him&s;elf.
He forbore, therefore, to pre&s;s his &s;uit, till
he &s;hould have &s;ecured a &s;tronger intere&s;t
in her heart, and in this hope he was en|couraged
by Signora Bianchi, who&s;e gentle
remon&s;trances in his favour became every
day more plea&s;ing and more convincing.</P>
<P>Several weeks pa&s;&s;ed away in this kind
of intercour&s;e, till Ellena, yielding to the
repre&s;entations of Signora Bianchi, and to
the pleadings of her own heart, received
Vivaldi as an acknowledged admirer, and
the &s;entiments of his family were no longer
remembered, or, if remembered, it was
<PB N="86" REF="97">
with a hope that they might be overcome
by con&s;iderations more powerful.</P>
<P>The lovers, with Signora Bianchi and a
Signor Giotto, a di&s;tant relation of the
latter, frequently made excur&s;ions in the
delightful environs of Naples; for Vivaldi
was no longer anxious to conceal his at|tachment,
but wi&s;hed to contradict any re|port
injurious to his love, by the publicity
of his conduct; while the con&s;ideration, that
Ellena's name had &s;uffered by his late impru|dence,
contributed, with the un&s;u&s;pecting
innocence and &s;weetne&s;s of her manners
towards him, who had been the occa&s;ion
of her injuries, to mingle a &s;acred pity
with his love, which obliterated all family
politics from his mind, and bound her ir|recoverably
to his heart.</P>
<P>The&s;e excur&s;ions &s;ometimes led them to
Puzzuoli, Baia, or the woody cliffs of Pau|&s;ilippo,
and as, on their return, they glided
along the moon-light bay, the melodies of
Italian &s;trains &s;eemed to give enchantment
to the &s;cenery of its &s;hore. At this cool
<PB N="87" REF="98">
hour the voices of the vine-dre&s;&s;ers were
frequently heard in trio, as they repo&s;ed,
after the labour of the day, on &s;ome plea|&s;ant
promontory, under the &s;hade of pop|lars;
or the bri&s;k mu&s;ic of the dance from
fi&s;hermen, on the margin of the waves be|low.
The boatmen re&s;ted on their oars,
while their company li&s;tened to voices mo|dulated
by &s;en&s;ibility to finer eloquence,
than is in the power of art alone to di&s;play;
and at others, while they ob&s;erved the airy
natural grace, which di&s;tingui&s;hes the dance
of the fi&s;hermen and pea&s;ants of Naples.
Frequently as they glided round a pro|montory,
who&s;e &s;haggy ma&s;&s;es impended far
over the &s;ea, &s;uch magic &s;cenes of beauty
unfolded, adorned by the&s;e dancing groups
on the bay beyond, as no pencil could do
ju&s;tice to. The deep clear waters reflected
every image of the land&s;cape, the cliffs,
branching into wild forms, crowned with
groves, who&s;e rough foliage often &s;pread
down their &s;teeps in picture&s;que luxuriance;
the ruined villa on &s;ome bold point, peep|ing
<PB N="88" REF="99">
through the trees; pea&s;ants' cabins
hanging on the precipices, and the dancing
figures on the &s;trand&mdash;all touched with the
&s;ilvery tint and &s;oft &s;hadows of moon-light.
On the other hand, the &s;ea trembling with
a long line of radiance, and &s;hewing in the
clear di&s;tance the &s;ails of ve&s;&s;els &s;tealing in
every direction along its &s;urface, pre&s;ented
a pro&s;pect as grand as the land&s;cape was
beautiful.</P>
<P>One evening that Vivaldi &s;at with Ellena
and Signora Bianchi, in the very pavilion
where he had overheard that &s;hort but in|tere&s;ting
&s;oliloquy, which a&s;&s;ured him of her
regard, he pleaded with more than his u&s;ual
earne&s;tne&s;s for a &s;peedy marriage. Bianchi
did not oppo&s;e his arguments; &s;he had been
unwell for &s;ome time, and, believing her&s;elf
to be declining fa&s;t, was anxious to have
their nuptials concluded. She &s;urveyed with
languid eyes, the &s;cene that &s;pread before
the pavilion. The &s;trong effulgence which
a &s;etting-&s;un threw over the &s;ea, &s;hewing
innumerable gaily painted &s;hips, and fi&s;hing|boats
<PB N="89" REF="100">
returning from Santa Lucia into the
port of Naples, had no longer power to
cheer her. Even the Roman tower that
terminated the mole below, touched as it
was with the &s;lanting rays; and the various
figures of fi&s;hermen, who lay &s;moking be|neath
its walls, in the long &s;hadow, or &s;tood
in the &s;un&s;hine on the beach, watching the
approaching boats of their comrades, com|bined
a picture which was no longer in|tere&s;ting.
&startq;Alas!&endq; &s;aid &s;he, breaking
from meditative &s;ilence, &startq;this &s;un &s;o glo|rious,
which lights up all the various co|louring
of the&s;e &s;hores, and the glow of
tho&s;e maje&s;tic mountains; alas! I feel that
it will not long &s;hine for me&mdash;my eyes mu&s;t
&s;oon clo&s;e upon the pro&s;pect for ever!&endq;</P>
<P>To Ellena's tender reproach for this melan|choly
&s;ugge&s;tion Bianchi replied only by ex|pre&s;&s;ing
an earne&s;t wi&s;h to witne&s;s the certain|ty
of her being protected; adding, that this
mu&s;t be &s;oon, or &s;he &s;hould not live to &s;ee
it. Ellena, extremely &s;hocked both by this
pre&s;age of her aunt's fate, and by the direct
<PB N="90" REF="101">
reference made to her own condition in the
pre&s;ence of Vivaldi, bur&s;t into tears, while
he, &s;upported by the wi&s;hes of Signora
Bianchi, urged his &s;uit with encrea&s;ed in|tere&s;t.</P>
<P>&startq;This is not a time for fa&s;tidious &s;cru|ples,&endq;
&s;aid Bianchi, &startq;now that a &s;olemn
truth calls out to us. My dear girl, I will
not di&s;gui&s;e my feelings; they a&s;&s;ure me
I have not long to live. Grant me then
the only reque&s;t I have to make, and my
la&s;t hours will be comforted.&endq;</P>
<P>After a pau&s;e &s;he added, as &s;he took the
hand of her niece, &startq;This will, no doubt,
be an awful &s;eparation to us both; and it
mu&s;t al&s;o be a mournful one, Signor,&endq;
turning to Vivaldi, &startq;for &s;he has been as a
daughter to me, and I have, I tru&s;t, fulfilled
to her the duties of a mother. Judge then,
what will be her feelings when I am no
more. But it will be your care to &s;ooth
them.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked at Ellena, and would have
&s;poken; her aunt, however, proceeded.
<PB N="91" REF="102">
&startq;My own feelings would now be little le&s;s
poignant, if I did not believe that I was
confiding her to a tenderne&s;s, which cannot
dimini&s;h; that I &s;hould prevail with her to
accept the protection of a hu&s;band. To
you, Signor, I commit the legacy of my
child. Watch over her future moments,
guard her from inquietude as vigilantly
as I have done, and, if po&s;&s;ible, from mi&s;|fortune!
I have yet much to &s;ay, but my
&s;pirits are exhau&s;ted.&endq;</P>
<P>While he li&s;tened to this &s;acred charge,
and recollected the injury Ellena had al|ready
&s;u&s;tained for his &s;ake, by the cruel
obliquy which the Marche&s;e had thrown
upon her character, he &s;uffered a degree of
generous indignation, f which he &s;carcely
could conceal the cau&s;e, and a &s;ucceeding
tenderne&s;s that almo&s;t melted him to tears;
and he &s;ecretly vowed to defend her fame
and protect her peace, at the &s;acrifice of
every other con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>Bianchi, as &s;he concluded her exhorta|tion,
gave Ellena's hand to Vivaldi, who
<PB N="92" REF="103">
received it with emotion &s;uch as his coun$$|nance,
only, could expre&s;s, and with &s;olemn
fervour rai&s;ing his eyes to heaven, vowed
that he never would betray the confidence
thus repo&s;ed in him, but would watch over
the happine&s;s of Ellena with a care as ten|der,
as anxious, and as uncea&s;ing as her
own; that from this moment he con&s;idered
him&s;elf bound by ties not le&s;s &s;acred than
tho&s;e which the church confers, to defend
her as his wife, and would do &s;o to the
late&s;t moment of his exi&s;tence. As he &s;aid
this, the truth of his feelings appeared in
the energy of his manner.</P>
<P>Ellena, &s;tiil weeping, and agitated by va|rious
con&s;iderations, &s;poke not, but with
drawing the handkerchief from her face,
&s;he looked at him through her tears, with
a &s;mile &s;o meek, &s;o affectionate, &s;o timid,
yet &s;o confiding, as expre&s;&s;ed all the mingled
emotions of her heart, and appealed more
eloquently to his, than the mo&s;t energetic
language could have done.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="104">
Before Vivaldi left the villa, he had &s;ome
further conver&s;ation with Signora Bianchi,
when it was agreed that the nuptials &s;hould
be &s;olemnized on the following week, if
Ellena could be prevailed on to confirm
her con&s;ent &s;o &s;oon; and that when he re|turned
the next day, her determination
would probably be made known to him.</P>
<P>He departed for Naples once more with
the lightly-bounding &s;teps of joy, which,
however, when he arrived there, was &s;ome|what
alloyed by a me&s;&s;age from the Mar|che&s;e,
demanding to &s;ee him in his cabinet.
Vivaldi anticipated the &s;ubject of the interview,
and obeyed the &s;ummons with reluctance.</P>
<P>He found his father &s;o ab&s;orbed in
thought, that he did not immediately per|ceive
him. On rai&s;ing his eyes from the
floor, where di&s;content and perplexity
&s;eemed to have held them, he fixed a &s;tern
regard on Vivaldi. &startq;I under&s;tand,&endq; &s;aid
he, &startq;that you per&s;i&s;t in the unworthy pur|&s;uit
again&s;t which I warned you. I have
left you thus long to your own di&s;cretion,
<PB N="94" REF="105">
becau&s;e I was willing to afford you an op|portunity
of retracting with grace the de|claration,
which you have dared to make me
of your principles and intentions; but your
conduct has not therefore been the le&s;s ob|&s;erved.
I am informed that your vi&s;its have
been as frequent at the re&s;idence of the un|happy
young woman, who was the &s;ubject
of our former conver&s;ation, as formerly,
and that you are as much infatuated.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If it is Signora Ro&s;alba, whom your
lord&s;hip means,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;&s;he is not
unhappy; and I do not &s;cruple to own,
that I am as &s;incerely attached to her as
ever. Why, my dear father,&endq; continued
he, &s;ubduing the feelings which this de|grading
mention of Ellena had arou&s;ed,
&startq;why will you per&s;i&s;t in oppo&s;ing the hap|pine&s;s
of your &s;on; and above all, why will
you continue to think unju&s;tly of her, who
de&s;erves your admiration, as much as my
love?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As I am not a lover,&endq; replied the
Marche&s;e, &startq;and that the age of boyi&s;h
<PB N="95" REF="106">
credulity is pa&s;t with me, I do not wilfully
clo&s;e my mind again&s;t examination, but am
directed by proof and yield to conviction.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What proof is it, my Lord, that has
thus ea&s;ily convinced you?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi;
&startq;Who is it that per&s;i&s;ts in abu&s;ing your
con&s;idence, and in de&s;troying my peace?&endq;</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e haughtily reproved his &s;on
for &s;uch doubts and que&s;tions, and a long
conver&s;ation en&s;ued, which &s;eemed neither
to reconcile the intere&s;ts or the opinions
of either party. The Marche&s;e per&s;i&s;ted
in accu&s;ation and menace; and Vivaldi in
defending Ellena, and in affirming, that his
affections and intentions were irrecover|able.</P>
<P>Not any art of per&s;ua&s;ion could prevail
with the Marche&s;e to adduce his proofs, or
deliver up the name of his informer; nor
any menace awe Vivaldi into a renunciation
of Ellena; and they parted mutually di&s;|&s;atisfied.
The Marche&s;e had failed on this
occa&s;ion to act with his u&s;ual policy, for his
menaces and accu&s;ations had arou&s;ed &s;pirit
<PB N="96" REF="107">
and indignation, when kindne&s;s and gentle
remon&s;trance would certainly have, awa|kened
filial affection, and might have occa|&s;ioned
a conte&s;t in the brea&s;t of Vivaldi.
Now, no &s;truggle of oppo&s;ing duties divided
his re&s;olution. He had no hesitation on
the &s;ubject of their di&s;pute; but, regarding
his father as a haughty oppre&s;&s;or who would
rob him of his mo&s;t &s;acred right; and as
one who did not &s;cruple to &s;tain the name
of the innocent and the defencele&s;s, when
his intere&s;t required it, upon the doubtful
authority of a ba&s;e informer, he &s;uffered
neither pity or remor&s;e to mingle with the
re&s;olution of a&s;&s;erting the freedom of his
nature; and was even more anxious than
before, to conclude a marriage which he
believed would &s;ecure his own happine&s;s,
and the reputation of Ellena.</P>
<P>He returned, therefore, on the following
day to the villa Altieri, with encrea&s;ed im|patience
to learn the re&s;ult of Signora Bian|chi's
further conver&s;ation with her niece,
and the day on which the nuptials might
<PB N="97" REF="108">
be &s;olemnized. On the way thither, his
thoughts were wholly occupied by Ellena,
and he proceeded mechanically, and with|out
ob&s;erving where he was, till the &s;hade
which the well-known arch threw over the
road recalled him to local circum&s;tances,
and a voice in&s;tantly arre&s;ted his attention.
It was the voice of the monk, who&s;e figure
again pa&s;&s;ed before him. &startq;Go not to the
villa Altieri,&endq; it &s;aid &s;olemnly, &startq;for death
is in the hou&s;e!&endq;</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi could recover from the
di&s;may into which this abrupt a&s;&s;ertion and
&s;udden appearance had thrown him, the
&s;tranger was gone. He had e&s;caped in the
gloom of the place, and &s;eemed to have re|tired
into the ob&s;curity, from which he had
&s;o &s;uddenly emerged, for he was not &s;een
to depart from under the archway. Vivaldi
pur&s;ued him with his voice, conjuring him
to appear, and demanding who was dead;
but no voice replied.</P>
<P>Believing that the &s;tranger could not have
e&s;caped un&s;een from the arch by any way,
<PB N="98" REF="109">
but that leading to the fortre&s;s above, Vivaldi
began to a&s;cend the &s;teps, when, con&s;idering
that the more certain means of understand|ing
this awful a&s;&s;ertion would be, to go im|mediately
to the villa Altieri, he left this
portentous ruin, and ha&s;tened thither.</P>
<P>An indifferent per&s;on would probably
have under&s;tood the words of the monk to
allude to Signora Bianchi, who&s;e infirm
&s;tate of health rendered her death, though
&s;udden, not improbable; but to the af|frighted
fancy of Vivaldi, the dying Ellena
only appeared. His fears, however proba|bilities
might &s;anction, or the event ju&s;tify
them, were natural to ardent affection;
but they were accompanied by a pre&s;enti|ment
as extraordinary as it was horrible;&mdash;it
occurred to him more than once, that
Ellena was murdered. He &s;aw her wound|ed,
and bleeding to death; &s;aw her a&s;hy
countenance, and her wa&s;ting eyes, from
which the &s;pirit of life was fa&s;t departing,
turned pireou&s;ly on him&s;elf, as if imploring
him to &s;ave her from the fate that was
<PB N="99" REF="110">
dragging her to the grave. And, when
he reached the boundary of the garden,
his Whole frame trembled &s;o, with horrible
apprehen&s;ion, that he re&s;ted a while, unable
to venture further towards the truth. At
length, he &s;ummoned courage to dare it,
and, unlocking a private gate, of which he
had lately received the key, becau&s;e it &s;pared
him a con&s;iderable di&s;tance of the road to
Naples, he approached the hou&s;e. Every
place around it was &s;ilent and for&s;aken;
many of the lattices were clo&s;ed, and, as he
endeavoured to collect from every trivial
circum&s;tance &s;ome conjecture, his &s;pirits &s;till
&s;unk as he advanced, till, having arrived
within a few paces of the portico, all his
fears were confirmed. He heard from with|in
a feeble &s;ound of lamentation, and then
&s;ome notes of that &s;olemn and peculiar kind
of recitative, which is in &s;ome parts of Italy
the requiem of the dying. The &s;ounds
were &s;o low and di&s;tant that they only mur|mured
on his ear; but, without pau&s;ing
for information, he ru&s;hed into the portico,
<PB N="100" REF="111">
and knocked loudly at the folding doors,
now clo&s;ed again&s;t him.</P>
<P>After repeated &s;ummon&s;es, Beatrice, the
old hou&s;e-keeper, appeared. She did not
wait for Vivaldi's enquiries. &startq;Alas! Sig|nor,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;alas-a-day! who would
have thought it; who would have expec|ted
&s;uch a change as this! It was only ye&s;|ter-evening
that you was here,&mdash;&s;ee was
then as well as I am; who would have
thought that &s;he would be dead to-day?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She <HI>is</HI> dead, then!&endq; exclaimed Vival|di,
&s;truck to the heart; &startq;&s;he <HI>is</HI> dead!&endq;
&s;taggering towards a pillar of the hall, and
endeavouring to &s;upport him&s;elf again&s;t it.
Beatrice, &s;hocked at his condition, would
have gone for a&s;&s;i&s;tance, but he waved her
to &s;tay. &startq;When did &s;he die,&endq; &s;aid he,
drawing breath withdifficulty, &startq;how and
where?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! here in the villa, Signor,&endq; re|plied
Beatrice, weeping; &startq;who would have
thought that I &s;hould live to &s;ee this day!
<PB N="101" REF="112">
I hoped to have laid down my old bones
in peace.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What has cau&s;ed her death?&endq; inter|rupted
Vivaldi impatiently, &startq;and when
did &s;he die?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;About two of the clock this morning,
Signor; about two o'clock. O mi&s;erable
day, that I &s;hould live to &s;ee it!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am better,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, rai&s;ing him&s;elf;
&startq;lead me to her apartment,&mdash;I mu&s;t
&s;ee her. Do not he&s;itate, lead me on.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! Signor, it is a di&s;mal &s;ight;
why &s;hould you wi&s;h to &s;ee her? Be per|&s;uaded;
do not go, Signor; it is a woeful
&s;ight!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lead me on,&endq; repeated Vivaldi &s;tern|ly;
&startq;or if you refu&s;e, I will find the way
my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Beatrice, terrified by his look and ge&s;|ture,
no longer oppo&s;ed him, begging only
that he would wait till &s;he had informed
her lady of his arrival; but he followed
her clo&s;ely up the &s;tairca&s;e and along a
corridor that led round the we&s;t &s;ide of the
<PB N="102" REF="113">
hou&s;e, which brought him to a &s;uite of
chambers darkened by the clo&s;ed lattices,
through which he pa&s;&s;ed towards the one
where the body lay. The requiem had
cea&s;ed, and no &s;ound di&s;turbed the awful
&s;tillne&s;s that prevailed in the&s;e de&s;erted
rooms. At the door of the la&s;t apartment,
where he was compelled to &s;top, his agita|tion
was &s;uch, that Beatrice, expecting
every in&s;tant to &s;ee him &s;ink to the floor,
made an effort to &s;upport him with her
feeble aid, but he gave a &s;ignal for her to
retire. He &s;oon recovered him&s;elf and
pa&s;&s;ed into the chamber of death, the &s;o|lemnity
of which might have affected him
in any other &s;tate of his &s;pirits; but the&s;e
were now too &s;everely pre&s;&s;ed upon by real
&s;uffering to feel the influence of local cir|cumstances.
Approaching the bed on which
the corp&s;e was laid, he rai&s;ed his eyes to the
mourner who hung weeping over it, and
beheld&mdash;Ellena! who, &s;urprized by this
&s;udden intru&s;ion, and &s;till more by the agi|tation
of Vivaldi, repeatedly demanded the
<PB N="103" REF="114">
occa&s;ion of it. But he had neither power
or inclination to explain a circum&s;tance,
which mu&s;t deeply wound the heart of
Ellena, &s;ince it would have told that the
&s;ame event, which excited her grief, acci|dentally
in&s;pired his joy.</P>
<P>He did not long intrude upon the &s;acred|ne&s;s
of &s;orrow, and the &s;hort time he re|mained
was employed in endeavours to
command his own emotion and to &s;oothe
her's.</P>
<P>When he left Ellena, he had &s;ome con|ver&s;ation
with Beatrice, as to the death of
Signora Bianchi, and under&s;tood that &s;he
had retired to re&s;t on the preceding night
apparently in her u&s;ual &s;tate of health.
&startq;It was about one in the morning, Signor,&endq;
continued Beatrice, &startq;I was waked out of
my fir&s;t &s;leep by a noi&s;e in my lady's cham|ber.
It is a grievous thing to me, Sig|nor,
to be waked from my fir&s;t &s;leep, and
I, Santa Maria forgive me! was angry at
being di&s;turbed! So I would not get up,
but laid my head upon the pillow again,
<PB N="104" REF="115">
and tried to &s;leep; but pre&s;ently I heard
the noi&s;e again; nay now, &s;ays I, &s;omebody
mu&s;t be up in the hou&s;e, that's certain. I
had &s;carcely &s;aid &s;o, Signor, when I heard
my young lady's voice calling &startq;Beatrice!
Beatrice!&endq; Ah! poor young lady! &s;he was
indeed in a &s;ad fright, as well &s;he might.
She was at my door in an in&s;tant, and look|ed
as pale as death, and trembled &s;o! &startq;Bea|trice,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, &startq;ri&s;e this moment; my aunt
is dying.&endq; She did not &s;tay for my an&s;wer,
but was gone directly. Santa Maria pro|tect
me! I thought I &s;hould have &s;wooned
outright.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, but your lady?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi,
who&s;e patience the tedious circumlocution
of old Beatrice had exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! my poor lady! Signor, I thought
I never &s;hould have been able to reach her
room; and when I got there, I was &s;carce|ly
more alive than her&s;elf.&mdash;There &s;he lay
on her bed! O it was a grievous &s;ight to
&s;ee! there &s;he lay, looking &s;o piteou&s;ly; I
&s;aw &s;he was dying. She could not &s;peak,
<PB N="105" REF="116">
though &s;he tried often, but &s;he was &s;en&s;ible,
for &s;he would look &s;o at Signora Ellena,
and then try again to &s;peak; it almo&s;t
broke one's heart to &s;ee her. Something
&s;eemed to lie upon her mind, and &s;he tried
almo&s;t to the la&s;t to tell it; and as &s;he
gra&s;ped Signora Ellena's hand, &s;he would
&s;till look up in her face with &s;uch doleful
expre&s;&s;ion as no one who had not a heart
of &s;tone could bear. My poor young mi&s;|tre&s;s
was quite overcome by it, and cried
as if her heart would break. Poor young
lady! &s;he has lo&s;t a friend indeed, &s;uch a
one as &s;he mu&s;t never hope to &s;ee again.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But &s;he &s;hall find one as &s;irm and af|fectionate
as the la&s;t!&endq; exclaimed Vivaldi
fervently.</P>
<P>&startq;The good Saint grant it may prove
&s;o!&endq; replied Beatrice, doubtingly. &startq;All
that could be done for our dear lady,&endq; &s;he
continued, &startq;was tried, but with no avail.
She could not &s;wallow what the Doctor of|fered
her. She grew fainter and fainter, yet
would often utter &s;uch deep &s;ighs, and then
<PB N="106" REF="117">
would gra&s;p my hand &s;o hard! At la&s;t &s;he
turned her eyes from Signora Ellena, and
they grew duller and fixed, and &s;he &s;eemed
not to &s;ee what was before her. Alas! I
knew then &s;he was going; her hand did
not pre&s;s mine as it had done a minute or
two before, and a deadly coldne&s;s was upon
it. Her face changed &s;o too in a few mi|nutes!
This was about two o'clock, and
&s;he died before her confe&s;&s;or could admi|ni&s;ter.&endq;</P>
<P>Beatrice cea&s;ed to &s;peak, and wept; Vi|valdi
almo&s;t wept with her, and it was
&s;ome time before he could command his
voice &s;ufficiently to enquire, what were the
&s;ymptoms of Signora Bianchi's di&s;order,
and whether &s;he had ever been thus &s;ud|denly
attacked before.</P>
<P>&startq;Never, Signor!&endq; replied the old hou&s;e|keeper;
&startq;and though, to be &s;ure, &s;he has
long been very infirm, and going down, as
one may &s;ay, yet,&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;What is it you mean?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="118">
&startq;Why, Signor, I do not know what to
think about my lady's death. To be &s;ure,
there is nothing certain; and I may only
get &s;coffed at, if &s;peak my mind abroad,
for nobody would believe me, it is &s;o
&s;trange, yet I mu&s;t have my own thoughts,
for all that.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do &s;peak intelligibly,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi,
&startq;you need not apprehend cen&s;ure from
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not from you, Signor, but if the re|port
&s;hould get abroad, and it was known
that I had &s;et it a-going.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That never &s;hall be known; from me,&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi, with encrea&s;ed impatience,
&startq;tell me, without fear, all that you con|jecture.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well then, Signor, I will own, that I
do not like, the &s;uddenne&s;s of my lady's
death, no, nor the manner of it, nor her
appearance after death!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Speak explicitly, and to the point,&endq;
&s;iad Vivaldi.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="119">
&startq;Nay, Signor, there are &s;ome folks that
will not under&s;tand if you &s;peak ever &s;o
plain, I am &s;ure I &s;peak plain enough. If
I might tell my mind,&mdash;I do not believe
&s;he came fairly by her death at la&s;t!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;your rea&s;ons?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, Signor, I have given them al|ready;
I &s;aid I did not like the &s;uddenue&s;s
of her death, nor her appearance after,
nor&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Good heaven!&endq; interrupted Vivaldi,
&startq;you mean poi&s;on!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hu&s;h, Signor, hu&s;h! I do not &s;ay that;
but &s;he did not &s;eem to die naturally.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Who has been at the villa lately?&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi, in a tremulous voice.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! Signor, nobody has been here;
&s;he lived &s;o privately that &s;he &s;aw nobody.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not one per&s;on?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;con|&s;ider
well, Beatrice, had &s;he no vi&s;itor?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not of a long while, Signor, no vi|&s;itors
but your&s;elf and her cou&s;in Signor
Giotto. The only other per&s;on that has
been within the&s;e walls for many weeks, to
<PB N="109" REF="120">
the be&s;t of my remembrance, is a &s;i&s;ter of the
Convent, who comes for the &s;ilks my young
lady embroiders.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Embroiders! What convent?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Santa Maria della Pieta, yonder,
Signor; if you will &s;tep this way to the
window, I will &s;hew it you. Yonder,
among the woods on the hill-&s;ide, ju&s;t a|bove
tho&s;e gardens that &s;tretch down to
the bay. There is an olive ground clo&s;e
be&s;ide it, and ob&s;erve, Signor, there is a
red and yellowi&s;h ridge of rocks ri&s;es over
the woods higher &s;till, and looks as if it
would fall down upon tho&s;e old &s;pires.
Have you found it, Signor?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How long is it &s;ince this &s;i&s;ter came
here?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Three weeks at Iea&s;t, Signor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And you are certain that no other
per&s;on has called within that time?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No other, Signor, except the fi&s;her|man
and the gardener, and a man who
brings maccaroni, and &s;uch &s;ort of things;
<PB N="110" REF="121">
for it is &s;uch a long way to Naples, Signor,
and I have &s;o little time.</P>
<P>&startq;Three weeks, &s;ay you! You &s;aid three
weeks, I think? Are you certain as to
this?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Three weeks, Signor! Santa della
Pieta! Do you believe, Signor, that we
could fa&s;t for three weeks! Why, they call
almo&s;t every day.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I &s;peak of the nun,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;O yes, Signor,&endq; replied Beatrice; &startq;it
is that, at lea&s;t, &s;ince &s;he was here.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is &s;trange!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, mu&s;ing,
&startq;but I will talk with you &s;ome other time.
Meanwhile, Iwi&s;h you could contrive that
I &s;hould &s;ee the face of your decea&s;ed lady,
without the knowledge of Signora Ellena.
And, ob&s;erve me, Beatrice, be &s;trictly &s;ilent
as to your &s;urmi&s;es concerning her death:
do not &s;uffer any negligence to betray your
&s;u&s;picions to your young mi&s;tre&s;s. Has
&s;he any &s;u&s;picions her&s;elf of the &s;ame na|ture.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="111" REF="122">
Beatrice replied, that &s;he believed Sig|nora
Ellena had none; and promi&s;ed faith|fully
to ob&s;erve his injunctions.</P>
<P>He then left the villa, meditating on the
circum&s;tances he had ju&s;t learned, and on
the prophetic a&s;&s;ertion of the monk, be|tween
whom, and the cau&s;e of Bianchi's
&s;udden death, he could not forbear &s;urmi&s;ing
there was &s;ome connection; and it
now occurred to him, and for the fir&s;t time,
that this monk, this my&s;terious &s;tranger,
was no other than Schedoni, whom he had
ob&s;erved of late going more frequently than
u&s;ual, to his mother's apartment. He al|mo&s;t
&s;tarted, in horror of the &s;u&s;picion, to
which this conjecture led, and precipitately
rejected it, as a poi&s;on that would de&s;troy
his own peace for ever. But though he in|&s;tantly
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the &s;u&s;picion, the conjec|ture
returned to his mind, and he endea|voured
to recollect the voice and figure of
the &s;tranger, that he might compare them
with tho&s;e of the confe&s;&s;or. The voices
were, he thought, of a different tone, and
<PB N="112" REF="123">
the per&s;ons of a different height and pro|portion.
This compari&s;on, however, did
not forbid him to &s;urmi&s;e that the &s;tranger
was an agent of the confe&s;&s;or's; that he
was, at lea&s;t, a &s;ecret &s;py upon his actions,
and the defamer of Ellena; while both, if in|deed
there were two per&s;ons concerned, ap|peared
to be at the command of his parents.
Fired with indignation of the unworthy arts
that he believed to have been employed
again&s;t him, and impatient to meet the &s;lan|derer
of Ellena, he determined to attempt
&s;ome deci&s;ive &s;tep towards a di&s;covery of
the truth, and either to compel the confe&s;&s;or
to reveal it to him, or to &s;earch out his
agent, who, he fancied, was occa&s;ionally
a re&s;ident within the ruins of Paluzzi.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of the convent, which
Beatrice had pointed out, did not e&s;cape
his con&s;ideration, but no rea&s;on appeared
for &s;uppo&s;ing them the enemies of his El|lena,
who, on the contrary, he under&s;tood
had been for &s;ome years amicably connect|ed
with them. The embroidered &s;ilks, of
<PB N="113" REF="124">
which the old &s;ervant had &s;poken, &s;uffi|ciently
explained the nature of the con|nection,
and di&s;covering more fully the
circum&s;tances o&s; Ellena's fortune, her con|duct
heightened the tender admiration, with
which he had hitherto regarded her.</P>
<P>The hints for &s;u&s;picion which Beatrice
had given re&s;pecting the cau&s;e of her mi&s;|tre&s;s's
decea&s;e, ince&s;&s;antly recurred to him;
and it appeared extraordinary, and &s;ome|times
in the highe&s;t degree improbable, that
any per&s;on could be &s;ufficiently intere&s;ted in
the death of a woman apparently &s;o blame|le&s;s,
as to admini&s;ter poi&s;on to her. What
motive could have prompted &s;o horrible a
deed, was &s;till more inexplicable. It was
true that &s;he had long been in a declining
&s;tate; yet the &s;uddenne&s;s of her departure
and the &s;ingularity of &s;ome circum&s;tances
preceding as well as &s;ome appearances that
had followed it, compelled Vivaldi to doubt
as to the caufe. He believed, however,
that, after having &s;een the corp&s;e, his
doubts mu&s;t vani&s;h; and Beatrice had pro|mi&s;ed,
<PB N="114" REF="125">
that, if he could return in the even|ing,
when Ellena had retired to re&s;t, he
&s;hould be permitted to vi&s;it the chamber
of the decea&s;ed. There was &s;omething re|pugnant
to his feelings, in going thus
&s;ecretly, or, indeed, at all, to the re&s;idence
of Ellena at this delicate period, yet it was
nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould introduce there &s;ome
medical profe&s;&s;or, on who&s;e judgment he
could re&s;t, re&s;pecting the occa&s;ion of Bian|chi's
death; and as he believed he &s;hould
&s;o &s;oon acquire the right of vindicating the
honour of Ellena, that con&s;ideration did not
&s;o &s;eriou&s;ly affect him as otherwi&s;e it would
have done. The enquiry which called him
thither was, be&s;ides, of a nature too &s;olemn
and important to be lightly re&s;igned; he
had, therefore, told Beatrice he would be
punctual to the hour &s;he appointed. His
intention to &s;earch for the monk, was thus
again interrupted.</P>

<BIBL>MYSTERIOUS MOTHER.</BIBL></Q>
<P>WHEN Vivaldi returned to Naples, he
enquired for the Marche&s;a, of whom he
wi&s;hed to a&s;k &s;ome que&s;tions concerning
Schedoni, which, though he &s;carcely ex|pected
they would be explicitly an&s;wered,
might yet lead to part of the truth he
&s;ought for.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a was in her clo&s;et, and
Vivaldi found the confe&s;&s;or with her.
&startq;This man cro&s;&s;es me, like my evil ge|nius,&endq;
&s;aid he to him&s;elf as he entered,
&startq;but I will know whether he de&s;erves my
&s;u&s;picions before I leave the room.&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;o deeply engaged in con|ver&s;ation,
that he did not immediately per|ceive
Vivaldi, who &s;tood for a moment
<PB N="116" REF="127">
examining his countenance, and tracing
&s;ubjects for curio&s;ity in its deep lines. His
eyes, while he &s;poke, were ca&s;t downward,
and his features were fixed in an expre&s;&s;ion
at once &s;evere and crafty. The Marche&s;a
was li&s;tening with deep attention, her head
inclined towards him, as if to catch the
lowe&s;t murmur of his voice, and her face
picturing the anxiety and vexation of her
mind. This was evidently a conference,
not a confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>Vivaldi advancing, the monk rai&s;ed his
eyes; his countenance &s;uffered no change,
as they met tho&s;e of Vivaldi. He ro&s;e,
but did not take leave, and returned the
&s;light and &s;omewhat haughty &s;alutation of
Vivaldi, with an inclination of the head,
that indicated a pride without petti&s;hne&s;s,
and a firmne&s;s bordering on contempt.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, on perceiving her &s;on,
was &s;omewhat embarra&s;&s;ed, and her brow,
before &s;lightly contracted by vexation, now
frowned with &s;everity. Yet it was an in|voluntary
emotion, for &s;he endeavoured to
<PB N="117" REF="128">
chace the expre&s;&s;ion of it with a &s;mile,
Vivaldi liked the &s;mile &s;till le&s;s than the
frown.</P>
<P>Schedoni &s;eated him&s;elf quietly, and be|gan,
with almo&s;t the ea&s;e of a man of the
world, to conver&s;e on general topics. Vi|valdi,
however, was re&s;erved and &s;ilent; he
knew not how to begin a conver&s;ation, which
might lead to the knowledge he de&s;ired,
and the Marche&s;a did not relieve him from
the difficulty. His eye and his ear a&s;&s;i&s;ted
him to conjecture at lea&s;t, if not to obtain
the information he wi&s;hed; and, as he
li&s;tened to the deep tones of Schedoni's
voice, he became almo&s;t certain, that they
were not the accents of his unknown ad|vi&s;er,
though he con&s;idered, at the &s;ame
moment, that it was not difficult to di&s;gui&s;e,
or to feign a voice. His &s;tature &s;eemed to
decide the que&s;tion more rea&s;onably; for
the figure of Schedoni appeared taller than
that of the &s;tranger; and though there was
&s;omething of re&s;emblance in their air,
which Vivaldi had never ob&s;erved before,
<PB N="118" REF="129">
he again con&s;idered, that the habit of the
&s;ame order, which each wore, might ea&s;ily
occa&s;ion an artificial re&s;emblance. Of the
likene&s;s, as to countenance, he could not
judge, &s;ince the &s;tranger's had been &s;o much
&s;hrouded by his cowl, that Vivaldi $ had
never di&s;tinctly &s;een a &s;ingle feature. Sche|doni's
hood was now thrown back, &s;o that
he could not compare even the air of their
heads under &s;imilar circum&s;tances; but as
he remembered to have &s;een the confe&s;&s;or
on a former day approaching his mother's
clo&s;et with the cowl &s;hading his face, the
&s;ame gloomy &s;everity &s;eemed to characterize
both, and nearly the &s;ame terrible portrait
was drawn on his fancy. Yet this again
might be only an artificial, effect, a cha|racter
which the cowl alone gave to the
head; and any face &s;een imperfectly beneath
its dark &s;hade, might have appeared equally
&s;evere. Vivaldi, was &s;till extremely per|plexed
in his opinion. One circum&s;tance,
however, &s;eemed to throw &s;ome light on
his judgment. The &s;tranger had appeared
<PB N="119" REF="130">
in the habit? of a monk, and, if Vivaldi's
tran&s;ient ob&s;ervation might be tru&s;ted, he
was of the very &s;ame order with that of
Schedoni. Yet if he were Schedoni, or even
his agent, it was not probable that he would
have &s;hewn him&s;elf in dre&s;s that might
lead to di&s;covery of his per&s;on. That
he was anxious for concealment, his man|ner
had &s;trongly proved; it &s;eemed then,
that this habit of a monk was only a di&s;|gui&s;e,
a&s;&s;umed for the purpo&s;e of mi&s;leading
conjecture. Vivaldi, however, determined
to put &s;ome que&s;tions to Schedoni, and at
the &s;ame time to ob&s;erve their effect on his
countenance. He took occa&s;ion to notice
&s;ome drawings of ruins, which ornamented
the cabinet of the Marche&s;a, and to &s;ay
that the fortre&s;s of Paluzzi was worthy of
being added to her collection. &startq;You have
&s;een it lately, perhaps, reverend father,&endq;
added Vivaldi, with penetrating glance.</P>
<P>&startq;It is a &s;triking relique of antiquity,&endq;
replied the confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="131">
&startq;That arch,&endq; re&s;umed Vivaldi, his eye
&s;till fixed on Schedoni, &startq;that arch &s;u&s;pend|ed
between two rocks, the one overtopped
by the towers of the fortre&s;s, the other
&s;hadowed with pine and broad oak, has a
fine effect. But a picture of it would want
human figures. Now either the grote&s;que
&s;hapes of banditti lurking within the ruin,
as if ready to &s;tart out upon the traveller,
or a friar rolled up in his black garments,
ju&s;t &s;tealing forth from under the &s;hade of
the arch, and looking like &s;ome &s;upernatural
me&s;&s;enger of evil, would fini&s;h the piece.&endq;</P>
<P>The features of Schedoni &s;uffered no
change during this &s;peech. &startq;Your pic|ture
is complete,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;and I cannot
but admire the facility with which you have
cla&s;&s;ed the monks together with banditti.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your pardon, holy father,&endq; &s;aid Vi|valdi,
&startq;I did not draw a parallel between
them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O! no offence, Signor,&endq; replied Sche|doni,
with a &s;mile &s;omewhat gha&s;tly.</P>
<P><PB N="121" REF="132">
During the latter, part of this conver&s;a|tion,
if conver&s;ation it may be called, the
Marche&s;a had followed a &s;ervant, who had
brought her a letter, out of the apartment,
and as the confe&s;&s;or appeared to await her
return, Vivaldi determined to pre&s;s his en|quiry.
&startq;It appears, however,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;that Palluzzi, if not haunted by robbers,
is at lea&s;t frequented by eccle&s;ia&s;tics; for I
have &s;eldom pa&s;&s;ed it without &s;eeing one of
the order, and that one has appeared &s;o
&s;uddenly, and vani&s;hed &s;o &s;uddenly, that I
have been almo&s;t compelled to believe he
was literally a &s;piritual being!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The convent of the Black Penitents
is not far di&s;tant,&endq; ob&s;erved the confe&s;&s;or,</P>
<P>&startq;Does the dre&s;s of this convent re&s;emble
that of your order, reverend father? for I
ob&s;erved that the monk I &s;peak of was
habited like your&s;elf; aye, and he was
about your &s;tature, and very much re|&s;embled
you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That well may be, Signor,&endq; replied
the confe&s;&s;or calmly; &startq;there are many
<PB N="122" REF="133">
brethren who, no doubt, re&s;emble each
other; but the brothers of the Black Pe|nitents
are clothed in &s;ackcloth; and the
death's head on the garment, the peculiar
&s;ymbol of this order, would not have
e&s;caped your ob&s;ervation; it could not,
therefore, be a member of their &s;ociety
whom you have &s;een.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am not inclined to think that it was,&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi; &startq;but be it who it may, I hope
&s;oon to be better acquainted with him, and
to tell him truths &s;o &s;trong, that he &s;hall
not be permitted even to affect the mi&s;|under&s;tanding
of them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You will do right, if you have cau&s;e
of complaint again&s;t him,&endq; ob&s;erved Sche|doni.</P>
<P>&startq;And <HI>only</HI> if I have cau&s;e of complaint,
holy father? Are &s;trong truths to be told
only when there is direct cau&s;e of com|plaint?
Is it only when we are injured that
we are to be &s;incere?&endq; He believed that
he had now detected Schedoni, who &s;eem|ed
to have betrayed a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s that
<PB N="123" REF="134">
Vivaldi; had rea&s;on for complaint again&s;t
The &s;tranger.</P>
<P>&startq;You will ob&s;erve, reverend father, that
I have not &s;aid I am injured,&endq; he added.
&startq;If you know that I am, this mu&s;t be by
other means than by my words; I have
not even expre&s;&s;ed re&s;entment.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Except by your voice and, eye, Sig|nor,&endq;
replied Schedoni, drily. &startq;When a
man is vehement and di&s;ordered, we u&s;ually
are inclined to &s;uppo&s;e he feelsre&s;entment,
and that he has cau&s;e of complaint, either
real or imaginary. As I have$ not the
honour of being acquainted with the &s;ub|ject
you allude to, I cannot decide to which
of the two your cau&s;e belongs.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have never been in doubt as to that,&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi haughtily; &startq;and if I had, you
will pardon me, holy father, but I &s;hould
not have reque&s;ted your deci&s;ion. My in|juries
are, alas! too real; and I now think
it is al&s;o too certain to whom I may attri|bute
them. The &s;ecret advi&s;er, who &s;teals
into the bo&s;om of a family only to poi&s;on
<PB N="124" REF="135">
its repo&s;e, the informer&mdash;the ba&s;e a&s;per&s;er
of innocence, &s;tand revealed in one per&s;on,
before me.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi delivered the&s;e words with a
tempered energy, at once dignified and
pointed, which &s;eemed to &s;trike directly
to the heart of Schedoni; but, whether it
was his con&s;cience or his pride that took
the alarm, did not certainly appear. Vi|valdi
believed the former. A dark malig|nity
over&s;pread the features of the monk,
and at that moment Vivaldi thought he
beheld a man, who&s;e pa&s;&s;ions might impel
him to the perpetration of almo&s;t any
crime, how hideous &s;oever. He recoiled
from him, as if he had &s;uddenly &s;een a &s;er|pent
in his path, and &s;tood gazing on his
face, with an attention &s;o wholly occupied
as to be uncon&s;cious that he did &s;o.</P>
<P>Schedoni almo&s;t in&s;tantly recovered him|&s;elf;
his features relaxed from their fir&s;t
expre&s;&s;ion, and that portentous darkne&s;s
pa&s;&s;ed away from his countenance; but
with a look that was &s;till &s;tern and haughty,
<PB N="125" REF="136">
he &s;aid, &startq;Signor, however ignorant I may
be of the &s;ubject of your di&s;content, I can
not mi&s;under&s;tand that your re&s;entment is,
to &s;ome extent or other, directed again&s;t
my&s;elf as the cau&s;e of it. Yet I will not
&s;uppo&s;e, Signor; I &s;ay I will not &s;uppo&s;e,&endq;
rai&s;ing his voice &s;ignificantly, &startq;that you
have dared to brand me with the ignomi|nious
titles you have ju&s;t uttered but&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;I have applied them to the author of
my injuries,&endq; interrupted-Vivaldi; &startq;you,
father, can be&s;t inform me whether they
applied to your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have then nothing to complain of,&endq;
&s;aid Schedoni, adroitly, and with a &s;udden
calmne&s;s, that &s;urpri&s;ed Vivaldi. &startq;If you
directed them again&s;t the author of your
injuries, whatever they may be, I am &s;ati&s;|fied.&endq;</P>
<P>The chearful complacency, with which
he &s;poke this, renewed the doubts of Vi|valdi,
who thought it nearly impo&s;&s;ible that
a man con&s;cious of guilt could a&s;&s;ume,
under the very charge of it, the tranquil
<PB N="126" REF="137">
and dignified air, which the confe&s;&s;or
now di&s;played. He began to accu&s;e him|&s;elf
of having condemned him with pa&s;|&s;ionate
ra&s;hne&s;s, and gradually became
&s;hocked at the indecorum of his conduct
towards a man of Schedoni's age and &s;a|cred
profe&s;&s;ion. Tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions of coun|tenance,
which had &s;o much alarmed him,
he was now inclined to think the effect of a
jealous and haughty honour, and he almo&s;t
forgot the malignity, which had mingled
with Schedoni's pride, in &s;orrow for the
offence that had provoked it. Thus, not
le&s;s precipitate in his pity than his anger,
and credulous alike to the pa&s;&s;ion of the
moment, he was now as eager to apolo|gize
for his error, as he had been ha&s;ty in
committing it. The frankne&s;s, with which
he apologized and lamented the impropriety
of his conduct, would have won an ea&s;y
forgivene&s;s from a generous heart. Sche|doni
li&s;tened with apparent complacency
and &s;ecret contempt. He regarded Vivaldi
as a ra&s;h boy, who was &s;wayed only by his
<PB N="127" REF="138">
pa&s;&s;ions; but while, he &s;uffered deep re&s;ent|ment
for the evil in his character, he felt
neither re&s;pect nor kindne&s;s, for the good,
for the &s;incerity, the love of ju&s;tice, the
genero&s;ity, which threw$ a brilliancy even on
his foibles. Schedoni, indeed, &s;aw only
evil in human nature.</P>
<P>Had the heart of Vivaldi been le&s;s ge|nerous,
he would now have di&s;tru&s;ted the
&s;atisfaction, which the confe&s;&s;or a&s;&s;umed,
and have di&s;covered the contempt and
malignity, that lurked behind the &s;mile thus
imperfectly ma&s;king his countenance. The
confe&s;&s;or perceived his power, and the
character of Vivaldi lay before him as a
map. He &s;aw, or fancied he &s;aw every
line and feature of its plan, and the relative
proportions of every energy and weakne&s;s
of its nature. He believed, al&s;o, he could
turn the very virtues of this young man
again&s;t him&s;elf, and he exulted, even while
the &s;mile of good-will was yet upon his
countenance, in anticipating the moment
that &s;hould avenge him for the pa&s;t out|rage,
<PB N="128" REF="139">
and which, while Vivaldi was inge|nuou&s;ly
lamenting it, he had apparently
forgotten.</P>
<P>Schedoni was thus ruminating evil again&s;t
Vivaldi, and Vivaldi was con&s;idering how
he might po&s;&s;ibly make Schedoni atone|ment
for the affront he had offered him,
when the Marche&s;a returned to the apart|ment;
and perceived in the hone&s;t coun|tenance
of Vivaldi &s;ome &s;ymptoms of the
agitation which had pa&s;&s;ed over it; his
complexion was flu&s;hed, and his brow
&s;lightly contracted. The face of Schedoni
told nothing but complacency, except that
now and then when he looked at Vivaldi,
it was with half-&s;hut eyes, that indicated
treachery, or, at lea&s;t, cunning, trying to
conceal exa&s;perated pride.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a, with di&s;plea&s;ure directed
again&s;t her &s;on, enquired the rea&s;on of his
emotion; but he, &s;tung with con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of his conduct towards the monk, could
neither endure to explain it, or to remain
in her pre&s;ence, and &s;aying that he would,
<PB N="129" REF="140">
confide his honour to the discretion of the
holy father, who would &s;peak only too
favourably of his fault, he abruptly left the
room.</P>
<P>When he had departed, Schedoni gave,
with &s;eeming reluctance, the explanation
which the Marche&s;a required, but was
cautious not to &s;peak too favourably of
Vivaldi's conduct, which, on the contrary,
he repre&s;ented as much more in&s;ulting than
it really was; and, while he aggravated the
offen&s;ive part of it, he &s;uppre&s;&s;ed all men|tion
of the candour and &s;elf-reproach, which
had followed the charge. Yet this he
managed &s;o artfully that he appeared to
extenuate Vivaldi's errors, to lament the
ha&s;tine&s;s of his temper, and to plead for a
forgivene&s;s from his irritated mother. &startq;He
is very young,&endq; added the monk, when he
perceived that he had &s;ufficiently exa&s;perat|ed
the Marche&s;a again&s;t her &s;on; &startq;he is
very young, and youth is warm in its pa&s;|&s;ions
and precipitate in its judgments. He
was, be&s;ides, jealous, no doubt, of the
<PB N="130" REF="141">
friendship, with which you are plea&s;ed to
honour me; and it is natural that a &s;on
&s;hould be jealous of the attention of &s;uch a
mother.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are too good, father,&endq; &s;aid the
Marche&s;a; her re&s;entment encrea&s;ing to|wards
Vivaldi in proportion as Schedoni
di&s;played his artificial candour and meek|ness.</P>
<P>&startq;It is true,&endq; continued the confessor,
&startq;that I perceive all the inconveniences to
which my attachment, I &s;hould &s;ay my duty
to your family expo&s;es me; but I willingly
&s;ubmit to the&s;e, while it is yet po&s;&s;ible that
my advice may be a means of pre&s;erving
the honour of your hou&s;e un&s;ullied, and of
&s;aving this incon&s;iderate young man from
future mi&s;ery and unavailing repentance.&endq;</P>
<P>During the warmth of this &s;ympathy in
re&s;entment, the Marche&s;a and Schedoni
mutually, and &s;incerely, lo&s;t their remem|brance
of the unworthy motives, by which
each knew the other to be influenced, as
well as that di&s;gu&s;t which tho&s;e who act
<PB N="131" REF="142">
together to the &s;ame bad end, can &s;eldom
e&s;cape from feeling towards their a&s;&s;ociates.
The Marche&s;a, while &s;he commended the
fidelity of Schedoni, forgot his views and
her promi&s;es as to a rich benefice; while
the confe&s;&s;or imputed her anxiety for the
&s;plendor of her &s;on's condition to a real
intere&s;t in his welfare, not a care of her own
dignity. After mutual compliments had
been exchanged, they proceeded to a long
con&s;ultation concerning, Vivaldi, and it was
agreed, that their efforts for what they
termed his pre&s;ervation &s;hould no longer
be con&s;ined to remon&s;trances.</P>

<Q><L>&startq;What if it be a poi&s;on, which the friar</L>
<L>Subtly hath mini&s;tered?&endq;&mdash;</L>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>VIVALDI, when his fir&s;t feelings of pity
and compunction for having in&s;ulted an
aged man, the member of a &s;acred profe&s;|&s;ion,
were pa&s;t, and when he looked with a
more deliberate eye upon &s;ome circum|&s;tances
of the confe&s;&s;or's conduct, perceived
that &s;u&s;picion was again gathering on his
mind. But, regarding this as a &s;ymptom
of his own weakne&s;s, rather than as a hint
of truth, he endeavoured, with a magna|nimous
di&s;dain, to reject every &s;urmi&s;e that
boded unfavourably of Schedoni.</P>
<P>When evening arrived, he ha&s;tened to|wards
the villa Altieri, and, having met
without the city, according to appointment,
a phy&s;ician, upon who&s;e honor and judg|ment
<PB N="133" REF="144">
he thought he might rely, they pro|ceeded
on their way together. Vivaldi had
forgotten, during the confu&s;ion of his la&s;t
interview with Ellena, to deliver up the key
of the garden-gate, and he now entered it
as u&s;ual, though he could not entirely over|come
the reluctance, which he felt on thus
vi&s;iting, in &s;ecret and at night, the dwelling
of Ellena. Under no other circum&s;tances,
however, could the phy&s;ician, who&s;e opi|nion
was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary to his peace, be in|troduced
without betraying a &s;u&s;picion,
which mu&s;t render her unhappy, probably
for ever.</P>
<P>Beatrice, who had watched for them in
the portico, led the way to the chamber
where the corp&s;e was laid out; and Vivaldi,
though con&s;iderably affected when he en|tered
&s;oon recovered compo&s;ure enough to
take his &s;tation on one &s;ide of the bed,
while the phy&s;ician placed him&s;elf on the
other. Unwilling to expo&s;e his emotion to
the ob&s;ervation of a &s;ervant, and de&s;irous
al&s;o of &s;ome private conver&s;ation with the
<PB N="134" REF="145">
phy&s;ician, he took the lamp from Beatrice
and dismi&s;&s;ed her. As the light glared
upon the livid face of the corp&s;e Vivaldi
gazed with melancholy &s;urprize, and an
effort of rea&s;on was nece&s;&s;ary to convince
him, that this was the &s;ame countenance
which only one evening preceding was ani|mated
like his own; which had looked
upon him in tears, while, with anxiety the
mo&s;t tender, &s;he had committed the happi|ne&s;s
of her niece to his care, and had alas!
too ju&s;tly predicted her approaching di&s;&s;o|lution.
The circum&s;tances of that &s;cene
now appeared to him like a vi&s;ion, and
touched every fibre of his heart. He was
fully &s;en&s;ible of the importance of the tru&s;t
committed to him, and, as he now hung over
the pale and de&s;erted form of Bianchi, he
&s;ilently renewed his &s;olemn vows to Ellena$
to de&s;erve the confidence of her departed
guardian.</P>
<P>Before Vivaldi had courage enough to
a&s;k the opinion of the phy&s;ician, who was
&s;till Viewing the face of the decea&s;ed with very
<PB N="135" REF="146">
earne&s;t attention and di&s;approving counte|nance,
his own &s;u&s;picions &s;trengthened from
&s;ome circum&s;tances of her appearance; and
particularly form the black tint that pre|vailed
over her complexion, it &s;eemed to
him, that her death had been by poi&s;on.
He feared to break a &s;ilence, which pro|longed
his hope of the contrary, feeble
though it was; and the phy&s;ician, who pro|bably
was apprehen&s;ive for the con&s;equence
of delivering his real thought, did not
speak.</P>
<P>&startq;I read your opinion,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, at
length, &startq;it coincides with my own.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I know not as to that, Signor,&endq; re|plied
the phy&s;ician, &startq;though I think I per|ceive
what is yours. Appearances are un|favourable,
yet I will not take upon me to
decide from them, that it is as you &s;u&s;pect.
There are other circum&s;tances, under which
&s;imilar appearances might occur.&endq; He gave
his rea&s;ons for this a&s;&s;ertion which were
plau&s;ible even to Vivaldi, and concluded
with reque&s;ting to &s;peak with Beatrice, &startq;for
<PB N="136" REF="147">
I wi&s;h to under&s;tand,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;what was
the exact &s;ituation of this lady for &s;ome
hours previous to her decea&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>After a conver&s;ation of &s;ome length with
Beatrice, whatever might be the opinion re|&s;ulting
from his enquiries, he adhered nearly
to his former a&s;&s;ertions; pronouncing that
&s;o many contradictory circum&s;tances ap|peared,
as rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for him
to decide, whether Bianchi had died by
poi&s;on, or otherwi&s;e. He &s;tated more fully
than he had done before, the rea&s;ons, which
mu&s;t render the opinion of any medical
per&s;on, on this &s;ubject, doubtful. But, whe|ther
it was that he feared to be re&s;ponsible
for a deci&s;ion, which would accu&s;e &s;ome
per&s;on of murder, or that he really was in|clined
to believe that Bianchi died naturally,
it is certain he &s;eemed di&s;po&s;ed to adopt the
latter opinion; and that he was very
anxious to quiet the &s;u&s;picions of Vivaldi.
He &s;o far &s;ucceeded, indeed, as to convince
him that it would be unavailing to pur&s;ue
the enquiry, and almo&s;t compelled him to
<PB N="137" REF="148">
believe, that &s;he had departed according to
the common cour&s;e of nature.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, having lingered awhile over the
death-bed of Bianchi, and taken a la&s;t fare|wel
of her &s;ilent form, quitted the chamber
and the hou&s;e as &s;oftly as he had approach|ed,
and unob&s;erved, as he believed, by
Ellena or any other per&s;on. The morning
dawned over the &s;ea, when he returned into
the garden, and a few fi&s;hermen, loitering
on the beach, or putting off their little boats
from the &s;hore, were the only per&s;ons vi&s;ible
at this early hour. The time, however,
was pa&s;&s;ed for renewing the enquiry he had
purpo&s;ed at Paluzzi, and the brightening
dawn warned him to retire. To Naples,
therefore, he returned, with &s;pirits &s;ome|what
&s;oothed by a hope, that Bianchi had
not fallen prematurely, and by the certainty
that Ellena was well. On the way thither,
he pa&s;&s;ed the fort without interruption, and,
having parted with the phy&s;ician, was ad|mitted
into his father's man&s;ion by a con|fidential
&s;ervant.</P>

<L>Some &s;ix or &s;even, who did hide their faces</L>
<L>Even from darkness.</L>
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>ELLENA, on thus &s;uddenly lo&s;ing her
aunt, her only relative, the friend of her
whole life, felt as if left alone in the world.
But it was not in the fir&s;t moments of af|fliction
that this feeling occurred. Her
own forlorn &s;ituation was not even ob&s;erved,
while affection, pity, and irre&s;i&s;tible grief
for Bianchi, occupied her heart.</P>
<P>Bianchi was to be interred in the church
belonging to the convent of Santa Maria
della Pieta. The body, attired according
to the cu&s;tom of the country, and decorated
with flowers, was carried on an open bier
to the place of interment, attended only by
prie&s;ts and torch-bearers. But Ellena could
not endure thus lightly to part with the re|liques
<PB N="139" REF="150">
of a beloved friend, and being re&s;trained
by cu&s;tom from following the corp&s;e to the
grave, &s;he repaired fir&s;t to the convent, to
attend the funeral &s;ervice. Her &s;orrow did
not allow her to join in the choral &s;ympho|nies
of the nuns, but their &s;acred &s;olemnity
was &s;oothing to her &s;pirits, and the tears &s;he
&s;hed while &s;he li&s;tened to the lengthening
notes, a&s;&s;uaged the force, of grief.</P>
<P>When the &s;ervice concluded, &s;he with|drew
to the parlour of the lady Abbe&s;s,
who mingled with her con&s;olations many
entreaties that Ellena would make the con|vent
her pre&s;ent a&s;ylum; and her affliction
required little per&s;ua&s;ion on this subject. It
was her wi&s;h to retire hither as to a &s;anc|tuary
which was not only &s;uitable to her
particular circum&s;tances, but e&s;pecially
adapted to the pre&s;ent &s;tate of her &s;pirits.
Here &s;he believed that &s;he &s;hould &s;ooner ac|quire
re&s;ignation, and regain tranquillity,
than in a place le&s;s con&s;ecrated to religion;
and, before &s;he took leave of the Abbe&s;s,
it was agreed, that &s;he, &s;hould be received
<PB N="140" REF="151">
as a boarder. To acquaint Vivaldi with her
intention was, indeed, her chief motive for
returning to the villa Altieri, after this her re|solution
had been taken. Her affection and
e&s;teem had been gradual in their progre&s;s,
and had now attained a degree of &s;trength,
which promi&s;ed to decide the happine&s;s or
mi&s;ery of her whole life. The &s;anction
given by her aunt to this choice, and parti|cularly
the very &s;olemn manner in which,
on the evening preceding her death, &s;he be|queathed
Ellena to his care, had &s;till en|deared
him to her heart, and imparted a
&s;acredne&s;s to the engagement, which made
her con&s;ider Vivaldi as her guardian and
only &s;urviving protector. The more ten|derly
&s;he lamented her decea&s;ed relative, the
more tenderly &s;he thought of Vivaldi; and
her love for the one was &s;o intimately con|nected
with her affection for the other, that
each &s;eemed &s;trengthened and exalted by
the union.</P>
<P>When the funeral was over, they met at
Altieri.</P>
<P><PB N="141" REF="152">
He was neither &s;urprized or aver&s;e to her
withdrawing awhile to a convent; for there
was a propriety in retiring, during the pe|riod
of her grief, from a home where &s;he
had no longer a guardian, which delicacy
&s;eemed to demand. He only &s;tipulated,
that he might be permitted to vi&s;it her in
the parlour of the convent, and to claim,
when decorum &s;hould no longer object to it,
the hand, which Bianchi had re&s;igned to
him.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding that he yielded to this
arrangement without complaining, it was
not entirely without repining; but being
a&s;&s;ured by Ellena of the worthine&s;s of the
Abbe&s;s of the Santa Maria della Pieta, he
endeavoured to &s;ilence the &s;ecret murmurs
of his heart with the conviction of his
judgment.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the deep impre&s;&s;ion made by
his unknown tormentor, the monk, and
e&s;pecially by his prediction of the death of
Bianchi, remained upon his mind, and he
once more determined to a&s;certain, if po&s;|&s;ible,
<PB N="142" REF="153">
the true nature of this portentous vi&s;it|ant,
and what were the motives which induced
him thus to haunt his foot&s;teps and interrupt
his peace. He was awed by the circum&s;tances,
which had attended the vi&s;itations of the
monk, if monk it was; by the &s;uddenne&s;s
of his appearance, and departure; by the
truth of his prophecies; and, above all,
by the &s;olemn event which had verified his
la&s;t warning; and his imagination, thus ele|vated
by wonder and painful curio&s;ity, was
prepared for &s;omething above the reach of
common conjecture, and beyond the ac|compli&s;hment
of human agency. His un|der&s;tanding
was &s;ufficiently clear and &s;trong
to teach him to detect many errors of
opinion, that prevailed around him, as well
as to de&s;pi&s;e the common &s;uper&s;titions, of his
country, and, in the u&s;ual &s;tate of his mind,
he probably would not have pau&s;ed for a
moment on the &s;ubject before him; but his
pa&s;&s;ions were now intere&s;ted and his fancy
awakened, and, though he was uncon&s;cious
of this propen&s;ity, he would, perhaps, have
<PB N="143" REF="154">
been &s;omewhat di&s;appointed to have de|&s;cended
&s;uddenly from the region of fearful
&s;ublimity, to which he had &s;oared&mdash;the world
of terrible &s;hadows&mdash;to the earth, on which
he daily walked, and to an explanation
&s;imply natural.</P>
<P>He de&s;igned to vi&s;it again, at midnight,
the fortre&s;s of Paluzzi, and not to watch
for the appearance of the &s;tranger, but to
carry torches into every rece&s;s of the ruin,
and di&s;cover, at lea&s;t, whether it was haunt|ed
by other human beings than him&s;elf.
The chief difficulty, which had hitherto de|layed
him, was that of finding a per&s;on, in
whom he could confide, to accompany him
in the &s;earch, &s;ince his former, adventure
had warned him never to renew it alone.
Signor Bonarmo per&s;i&s;ted ab&s;olutely, and,
perhaps, wi&s;ely, to refu&s;e his reque&s;t on this
&s;ubject; and, as Vivaldi had no other ac|quaintance,
to whom he cho&s;e to give &s;o
much explanation of the affair as might in|duce
compliance, he at length determined
to take with him Paulo, his own &s;ervant.</P>
<P><PB N="144" REF="155">
On the evening, previous to the day of
Ellena's departure to the Santa della Pieta,
Vivaldi went to Altieri, to bid her adieu.
During this interview his &s;pirits were more
than u&s;ually depre&s;&s;ed; and, though he
knew that her retirement was only for a
&s;hort period, and had as much confidence in
the continuance of her affection, as is, per|haps,
po&s;&s;ible to a lover, Vivaldi felt as if he
was parting with her for ever. A thou&s;and
vague and fearful conjectures, &s;uch as he
had never till this moment admitted, a&s;|&s;ailed
him, and among&s;t them, it appeared
probable, that the arts of the nuns might
win her from the world, and &s;acrifice her to
the cloi&s;ter. In her pre&s;ent &s;tate of forrow
this &s;eemed to be even more than probable,
and not all the a&s;&s;urances which Ellena gave
him, and in the&s;e parting moments &s;he &s;poke
with le&s;s re&s;erve than &s;he had hitherto done,
could entirely re-a&s;&s;ure his mind. &startq;It
&s;hould &s;eem Ellena, by the&s;e boding fears,&endq;
&s;aid he, imprudently, &startq;that I am parting
with you for ever; I feel a weight upon
<PB N="145" REF="156">
my heart, which I cannot throw off. Yet
I con&s;ent that you &s;hall withdraw awhile to
this convent, convinced of the propriety of
the &s;tep; and I ought, al&s;o, to know that
you will &s;oon return; that I &s;hall &s;oon take
you from its walls as my wife, never more
to leave me, never more to pa&s;s from my
immediate care and tenderne&s;s. I ought to
feel a&s;&s;ured of all this; yet &s;o apt are my
fears that I cannot confide in what is pro|bable,
but rather apprehend what is po&s;&s;ible.
And is it then po&s;&s;ible that I yet may lo&s;e
you; and is it only probable that you may
be mine for ever? How, under &s;uch cir|cum&s;tances,
could I weakly con&s;ent to your
retirement? Why did I not urge you to
be&s;tow immediately tho&s;e indi&s;&s;oluble bands,
which no human force can burst a&s;under?
How could I leave the de&s;tiny of all my
peace within the reach of a po&s;&s;ibility, which
it was once in my power to have removed!
Which it <HI>was</HI> in my power!&mdash;It is, per|haps,
&s;till in my power. O Ellena! let the
&s;everities of cu&s;tom yield to the &s;ecurity of
<PB N="146" REF="157">
my happine&s;s. If you do go to the Santa
Maria, let it be only to vi&s;it its altar!&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi delivered this expo&s;tulation with a
rapidity, that left no pau&s;e for Ellena to in|terrupt
him. When, at length, he con|cluded,
&s;he gently reproached him for
doubting the continuance of her regard, and
endeavoured to &s;ooth his apprehen&s;ions of
misfortune, but would not li&s;ten to his re|que&s;t.
She repre&s;ented, that not only the
&s;tate of her &s;pirits required retirement, but
that re&s;pect to the memory of her aunt de|manded
it; and added gravely, that if he
had &s;o little confidence in the &s;teadine&s;s of
her opinions, as to doubt the con&s;tancy of
her affection, and for &s;o &s;hort a period, un|le&s;s
her vows were &s;ecured to him, he had
done imprudently to elect her for the com|panion
of his whole life.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, then a&s;hamed of the weakne&s;s he
had betrayed, be&s;ought her forgivene&s;s, and
endeavoured to appea&s;e apprehen&s;ions which
pa&s;&s;ion only made plau&s;ible, and which rea|&s;on
reproved; notwith&s;tanding which, he
<PB N="147" REF="158">
could recover neither tranquillity nor con|fidence;
nor could Ellena, though her
conduct was &s;upported and encouraged by
ju&s;tne&s;s of &s;entiment, entirely remove the
oppre&s;&s;ion of &s;pirits &s;he had felt from almo&s;t
the fir&s;t moment of this interview. They
parted with many tears; and Vivaldi, before
he finally took his leave, frequently return|ed
to claim &s;ome promi&s;e, or to a&s;certain
&s;ome explanation, till Ellena remarked with
a forced &s;mile, that the&s;e re&s;embled eternal
adieus, rather than tho&s;e of only a few days;
an ob&s;ervation which renewed all his alarm,
and furni&s;hed an excu&s;e for again delaying
his departure. At length he tore him&s;elf
away, and left the villa Altieri; but as the
time was yet too early to &s;uit his purpo&s;ed
enquiry at Paluzzi, he returned to Naples.</P>
<P>Ellena, meanwhile, endeavouring to di&s;&s;ipate
melancholy recollections by employ|ment,
continued bu&s;ied in preparation for
her departure on the following day, till a
late hour of the night. In the pro&s;pect of
quitting, though only for &s;o &s;hort a period,
<PB N="148" REF="159">
the home where &s;he had pa&s;&s;ed almo&s;t every
day &s;ince the dawn of her earlie&s;t remem|brance,
there was &s;omething melancholy,
if not &s;olemn. In leaving the&s;e well-known
&s;cenes, where, it might be &s;aid, the &s;hade
of her decea&s;ed relative &s;eemed yet to linger,
&s;he was quitting all ve&s;tige of her late hap|pine&s;s,
all note of former years and of pre|&s;ent
con&s;olation; and &s;he felt as if going
forth into a new and homele&s;s world. Her
affection for the place encrea&s;ed as the pa&s;&s;|ing
time dimini&s;hed, and it &s;eemed as if the
la&s;t moment of her &s;tay would be preci&s;ely
that, in which the villa Altieri would be
mo&s;t valued.</P>
<P>In her favourite apartments &s;he lingered
for a con&s;iderable time; and in the room
where &s;he had &s;upped on the night imme|diately
preceding the death of Signora
Bianchi, &s;he indulged many tender and
mournful recollections, and probably would
have continued to indulge them much
longer, had not her attention been with|drawn
by a &s;udden ru&s;tling of the foliage
<PB N="149" REF="160">
that &s;urrounded the window, when, on
rai&s;ing her eyes, &s;he thought &s;he perceived
&s;ome per&s;on pa&s;s quickly from before it.
The lattices had, as u&s;ual, been left open to
admit the fre&s;h breeze from the bay below,
but &s;he now ro&s;e with &s;ome alarm to clo&s;e
them, and had &s;carcely done &s;o when &s;he
heard a di&s;tant knocking from the portico,
and in the next in&s;tant the &s;creams of
Beatrice in the hall.</P>
<P>Alarmed for her&s;elf, Ellena had, however,
the courage to advance to the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
her old &s;ervant, when, on entering the pa&s;|&s;age
leading to the hall, three men, ma&s;ked
and muffled up in cloaks, appeared, ad|vancing
from the oppo&s;ite extremity. While
&s;he fled, they pur&s;ued her to the apartment
&s;he had quitted. Her breath and her cou|rage
were gone, yet &s;he &s;truggled to &s;u&s;tain
her&s;elf, and endeavoured to a&s;k with calm|ne&s;s
what was their errand. They gave no
reply, but threw a veil over her face, and,
&s;eizing her arms, led her almo&s;t unre&s;i&s;ting,
but &s;upplicating, towards the portico.</P>
<P><PB N="150" REF="161">
In the hall, Ellena perceived Beatrice
bound to a pillar; and another ruffian, who
was al&s;o ma&s;ked, watching over and me|nacing
her, not by words, but ge&s;tures.
Ellena's &s;hrieks &s;eemed to recall the almo&s;t
lifele&s;s Beatrice, for whom &s;he &s;upplicated
as much as for her&s;elf; but entreaty was
alike unavailing for each, and Ellena was
borne from the hou&s;e and through the gar|den.
All con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s had now for&s;aken
her. On recovering, &s;he perceived her&s;elf
in a carriage, which was driven with great
rapidity, and that her arms were within the
gra&s;p of &s;ome per&s;ons, whom, when her
recollection returned more fully, &s;he be|lieved
to be the men, who had carried her
from the villa. The darkne&s;s prevented her
from ob&s;erving their figures, and to all her
que&s;tions and entreaties a death-like &s;ilence
was ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>During the whole night the carriage pro|ceeded
rapidly, &s;topping only while the
hor&s;es were changed, when Ellena endea|voured
to intere&s;t by her cries the com|passion
<PB N="151" REF="162">
of the people at the po&s;t-hou&s;es, and
by her cries only, for the blinds were clo&s;ely
drawn. The po&s;tilions, no doubt, impo&s;ed
on the credulity of the&s;e people, for they
were in&s;en&s;ible to her di&s;tre&s;s, and her im|mediate
companions &s;oon overcame the only
means that had remained by which &s;he
could make it known.</P>
<P>For the fir&s;t hours, a tumult of terror
and amazement occupied her mind, but, as
this began to &s;ub&s;ide, and her understand|ing
to recover its clearne&s;s, grief and de|&s;pondency
mingled with her fears. She
&s;aw. her&s;elf &s;eparated from Vivaldi, probably
for ever, for &s;he apprehended that the
&s;trong and invi&s;ible hand which governed
her cour&s;e, would never relinqui&s;h its gra&s;p
till it had placed her irrecoverably beyond
the reach of her lover. A conviction that
&s;he &s;hould &s;ee him no more came, at inter|vals,
with &s;uch overwhelming force, that
every other con&s;ideration and emotion di&s;|appeared
before it; and at the&s;e moments
&s;he lo&s;t all anxiety as to the place of her
<PB N="152" REF="163">
de&s;tination, and all fear as to her per&s;onal
&s;afety.</P>
<P>As the morning advanced and the heat
encrea&s;ed, the blinds were let down a little
to admit air, and Ellena then perceived,
that only two of the men, who had appeared
at the villa Altieri, were in the carriage, and
that they were &s;till di&s;gui&s;ed in cloaks and
vi&s;ors. She had no means of judging
through what part of the country &s;he was
travelling, for above the &s;mall openings
which the blinds left &s;he could &s;ee only the
towering tops of mountains, or &s;ometimes
the veiny precipices and tangled thickets,
that clo&s;ely impended over the road.</P>
<P>About noon, as &s;he judged from the ex|ce&s;&s;ive
heat, the carriage &s;topped at a post|house,
and ice-water was handed through
the window, when, as the blind was lower|ed
to admit it, &s;he perceived her&s;elf on a
wild and &s;olitary plain, &s;urrounded by moun|tains
and woods. The people at the door
of the post-house &s;eemed &startq;unu&s;ed to pity
or be pitied.&endq; The lean and fallow coun|tenance
<PB N="153" REF="164">
of poverty &s;tared over their gaunt
bones, and habitual di&s;content had fixed the
furrows of their cheeks. They regarded
Ellena with only a feeble curio&s;ity, though
the affliction in her looks might have inte|re&s;ted
almo&s;t any heart that was not cor|roded
by its own &s;ufferings; nor did the
ma&s;ked faces of her companions excite a
much &s;tronger attention.</P>
<P>Ellena accepted the cool refre&s;hment of|fered
her, the fir&s;t &s;he had taken on the
road. Her companions having emptied
their gla&s;&s;es drew up the blind, and, not|with&s;tanding
the almo&s;t intolerable heat of
noon, the carriage proceeded. Fainting
under its oppre&s;&s;ion, Ellena entreated that
the windows might be open, when the men,
in compliance with their own nece&s;&s;ity ra|ther
than with her reque&s;t, lowered the
blinds, and &s;he had a glimp&s;e of the lofty
region of the mountains, but of no object
that could direct her conjecture concerning
where &s;he was. She &s;aw only pinnacles
and va&s;t precipices of various-tinted marbles,
<PB N="154" REF="165">
intermingled with &s;canty vegetation, &s;uch
as &s;tunted pina&s;ters, dwarf oak and holly,
which gave dark touches to the many-co|loured
cliffs, and &s;ometimes &s;tretched in
&s;hadowy ma&s;&s;es to the deep vallies, that,
winding into ob&s;curity, &s;eemed to invite
curio&s;ity to explore the &s;cenes beyond.
Below the&s;e bold precipices extended the
gloomy region of olive-trees, and lower &s;till
other rocky &s;teeps &s;unk towards the plains,
bearing terraces crowned with vines, and
where often the artificial &s;oil was propped
by thickets of juniper, pomegranate and
oleander.</P>
<P>Ellena, after having been &s;o long &s;hut in
darkne&s;s, and brooding over her own alarm|ing
circum&s;tances, found temporary, though
feeble, relief in once more looking upon the
face of nature; till, her &s;pirits being gra|dually
revived and elevated by the grandeur
of the images around her, &s;he &s;aid to her|&s;elf,
&startq;If I am condemned to mi&s;ery, &s;urely
I could endure it with more fortitude in
&s;cenes like the&s;e, than amid&s;t the tamer
<PB N="155" REF="166">
land&s;capes of nature! Here, the objects,
&s;eem to impart &s;omewhat of their own force,
their own &s;ublimity, to the &s;oul. It is
&s;carcely po&s;&s;ible to yield to the pre&s;&s;ure of
misfortune while we walk, as with the
Deity, amid&s;t his mo&s;t &s;tupendous works!&endq;</P>
<P>But &s;oon after the idea of Vivaldi glancing
athwart her memory, &s;he melted into tears;
the weakne&s;s however was momentary, and
during the re&s;t of the journey &s;he pre&s;erved
a &s;trenuous equality of mind.</P>
<P>It was when the heat and the light were de|clining
that the carriage entered a rocky defile,
which &s;hewed, as through a tele&s;cope re|ver&s;ed,
di&s;tantplains, and mountains opening
beyond, lighted up with all the purple &s;plen|dor
of the &s;etting &s;un. Along this deep
and &s;hadowy per&s;pective a river, which was
&s;een de&s;cending among the cliffs of a moun|tain,
rolled with impetuous force, fretting
and foaming amid&s;t the dark rocks in its
de&s;cent, and then flowing in a limpid lap&s;e
to the brink of other precipices, whence
again it fell with thundering &s;trength to the
<PB N="156" REF="167">
aby&s;s, throwing its mi&s;ty clouds of &s;pray
high in the air, and &s;eeming to claim the
&s;ole empire of this &s;olitary wild. Its bed
took up the whole breadth of the cha&s;m,
which &s;ome &s;trong convul&s;ion of the earth
&s;eemed to have formed; not leaving &s;pace
even for a road along its margin. The
road, therefore, was carried high among
the cliffs, that impended over the river, and
&s;eemed as if &s;u&s;pended in air; while the
gloom and va&s;tne&s;s of the precipices, which
towered above and &s;unk below it, together
with the amazing force and uproar of the
falling waters, combined to render the pa&s;s
more terrific than the pencil could de&s;cribe,
or language can expre&s;s. Ellena a&s;cended
it, not with indifference but with calmne&s;s;
&s;he experienced &s;omewhat of a dreadful
plea&s;ure in looking down upon the irre|&s;i&s;tible
flood; but this emotion was height|ened
into awe, when &s;he perceived that the
road led to a &s;light bridge, which, thrown
acro&s;s the cha&s;m at an immen&s;e height,
united two oppo&s;ite cliffs, between which
<PB N="157" REF="168">
the whole cataract of the river de&s;cended.
The bridge, which was defended only by a
&s;lender railing, appeared as if hung amid&s;t
the clouds. Ellena, while &s;he was cro&s;&s;ing
it, almo&s;t forgot her misfortunes. Having
reached the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the glen, the
road gradually de&s;cended the precipices for
about half a mile, when it opened to ex|ten&s;ive
pro&s;pects over plains and towards
di&s;tant mountains&mdash;the &s;un&s;hine land&s;cape,
which had long appeared to bound this
&s;hadowy pa&s;s. The tran&s;ition was as the
pa&s;&s;age through the vale of death to the
bli&s;s of eternity; but the idea of its resem|blance
did not long remain with Ellena.
Perched high among the cliffs of a moun|tain,
which might be &s;aid to terminate one
of the jaws of this terrific gorge, and which was
one of the loftie&s;t of a chain that &s;ur|rounded
the plains, appeared the &s;pires and
long terraces of a mona&s;tery; and &s;he &s;oon
under&s;tood that her journey was to con|clude
there.</P>
<P><PB N="158" REF="169">
At the foot of this mountain her compa|nions
alighted, and obliged her to do the
&s;ame, for the a&s;cent was too &s;teep and irre|gular
to admit of a carriage. Ellena fol|lowed
unre&s;i&s;tingly, like a lamb to the sa|crifice,
up a path that wound among the
rocks, and was cooly over&s;hadowed by
thickets of almond trees, figs, broad-leaved
myrtle, and ever-green ro&s;e bu&s;hes, inter|mingled
with the &s;trawberry tree, beautiful
in fruit and blo&s;&s;oms, the yellow ja&s;mine,
the delightful <HI>acacia mimo&s;a,</HI> and a variety
of other fragrant plants. Those bowers
frequently admitted glimp&s;es of the glowing
country below, and &s;ometimes opened to
expan&s;ive views bounded by the &s;nowy
mountains of Abruzzo. At every &s;tep
were objects which would have afforded
plea&s;ure to a tranquil mind; the beautifully
variegated marbles, that formed the cliffs
immediately above, their fractured ma&s;&s;es
embo&s;&s;ed with mo&s;&s;es and flowers of every
vivid hue that paints the rainbow; the ele|gance
of the &s;hrubs that tufted, and the
<PB N="159" REF="170">
maje&s;tic grace of the palms which waved
over them, would have charmed almo&s;t
any oth$ eye than Ellena's, who&s;e &s;pirit
was wrapt in care, or than tho&s;e of her
companions, who&s;e hearts were dead to
feeling. Partial features of the va&s;t edifice
&s;he was approaching, appeared now and
then between the trees; the tall we&s;t win|dow
of the cathedral with the &s;pires that
overtopped it; the narrow pointed roofs
of the cloi&s;ters; angles of the in&s;urmount|able
walls, which fenced the garden from,
the precipices below, and the dark portal
leading into the chief court; each of the&s;e,
&s;een at intervals beneath the gloom of
cypre&s;s and &s;preading cedar, &s;eemed as if
menacing the unhappy Ellena with hints
of future &s;uffering. She pa&s;&s;ed &s;everal
&s;hrines and images half hid among the
&s;hrubs and the cliffs; and, when &s;he drew
near the mona&s;tery, her companions &s;topped
at a little chapel which &s;tood be&s;ide the path,
where, after examining &s;ome papers, an act
<PB N="160" REF="171">
which she ob&s;erved with &s;urpri&s;e, they drew
a&s;ide, as if to con&s;ult re&s;pecting her&s;elf.
Their conver&s;ation was delivered in voices
&s;o low, that &s;he could not catch a single
tone di&s;tinctly, and it is probable that if &s;he
could, this would not have a&s;&s;i&s;ted her in con|jecturing
who they were; yet the profound
&s;ilence they had hitherto ob&s;erved had
much encrea&s;ed her curio&s;ity, now that
they &s;poke.</P>
<P>One of them &s;oon after quitted the chapel
and proceeded alone to the mona&s;tery, leav|ing
Ellena in the cu&s;tody of his comrade,
who&s;e pity &s;he now made a la&s;t, though
almo&s;t hopele&s;s, effort to intere&s;t. He re|plied
to all her entreaties only by a waving
of the hand, and an averted face; and &s;he
endeavoured to meet with fortitude and to
endure with patience, the evil which &s;he
could neither avoid nor &s;ubdue. The &s;pot
where &s;he awaited the return of the ruffian,
was not of a character to promote melan|choly,
except, indeed, that luxurious and
&s;olemn kind of melancholy, which a view
<PB N="161" REF="172">
of &s;tupendous objects in&s;pires. It over|looked
the whole extent of plains, of which
she had before caught partial &s;cenes, with
the va&s;t chain of mountains, which &s;eemed
to form an in&s;urmountable rampart to the
rich land&s;cape at their feet. Their towering
and fanta&s;tic &s;ummits, crowding together
into du&s;ky air, like flames tapering to a
point, exhibited images of peculiar gran|deur,
while each minuter line and feature
withdrawing, at this evening hour from ob|&s;ervation,
&s;eemed to re&s;olve it&s;elf into the
more gigantic ma&s;&s;es, to which the dubious
tint, the &s;olemn ob&s;curity, that began to
prevail over them, gave force and loftier
character. The &s;ilence and deep repo&s;e
of the land&s;cape, &s;erved to impre&s;s this
character more awfully on the heart, and
while Ellena &s;at wrapt in the thoughtful|ne&s;s
it promoted, the ve&s;per-&s;ervice of the
monks breathing &s;oftly from the cathedral
above, came to her ear; it was a mu&s;ic
which might be &s;aid to win on &s;ilence, and
was in perfect uni&s;on with her feelings;
<PB N="162" REF="173">
&s;olemn, deep, and full, it &s;welled, in holy
peels, and rolled away in murmurs, which
attention pur&s;ued to the la&s;t faint note that
melted into air. Ellena's heart owned the
power of this high min&s;trel&s;y; and while &s;he
caught for a moment the &s;weeter voices of
the nuns mingling in the chorus, &s;he in|dulged
a hope that they would not be
wholly in&s;en&s;ible to her &s;ufferings, and that
&s;he &s;hould receive &s;ome con&s;olation from
&s;ympathy as &s;oft as the&s;e tender-breathing
&s;trains appeared to indicate.</P>
<P>She had re&s;ted nearly half an hour on
the turfy &s;lope before the chapel, when &s;he
perceived through the twilight, two monks
de&s;cending from the mona&s;tery towards the
&s;pot where &s;he &s;at. As they drew near,
she di&s;tingui&s;hed their dre&s;s of grey &s;tuff,
the hood, the &s;haven head, where only a
coronet of white hair was left, and other
en&s;igns of their particular order. On reach|ing
the chapel they acco&s;ted her compani|on,
with whom they retired a few paces,
and conver&s;ed. Ellena heard, for the fir&s;t
<PB N="163" REF="174">
time, the &s;ound of her conductor's voice,
and though this was but faintly, she mark|ed
it well. The other ruffian did not yet
appear, but it &s;eemed evident that the&s;e
friars had left the convent in con&s;equence
of his information; and &s;ometimes, when
&s;he looked upon the taller of the two, &s;he
fancied &s;he &s;aw the per&s;on of the very man
who&s;e ab&s;ence &s;he had remarked, a con|jecture
which &s;trengthened while &s;he more
accurately noticed him. The portrait had
certainly much re&s;emblance in height and
bulk; and the &s;ame gaunt awkwardne&s;s,
which even the cloak of the ruffian had
not entirely &s;hrouded, obtruded it&s;elf from
under the folded garments of the reclu&s;e.
If countenance, too, might be tru&s;ted, this
&s;ame friar had a ruffian's heart, and his
keen and cunning eye &s;eemed habitually
upon the watch for prey. His brother of
the order &s;hewed nothing &s;trongly charac|teri&s;tic
either in his face or manner.</P>
<P>After a private conver&s;ation of &s;ome
length, the friars approached Ellena, and
<PB N="164" REF="175">
told her, that &s;he mu&s;t accompany them to
the convent; when her di&s;gui&s;ed conduct|or,
having re&s;igned her to them, immediate|ly
departed and de&s;cended the mountain.</P>
<P>Not a word was uttered by either of the
party as they pur&s;ued the &s;teep tract lead|ing
to the gates of this &s;ecluded edifice,
which were opened to them by a lay-bro|ther,
and Ellena entered a &s;pacious court.
Three &s;ides of this were enclo&s;ed by lofty
buildings, lined with ranges of cloi&s;ters;
the fourth opened to a garden, &s;haded with
avenues of melancholy cypre&s;s, that extend|ed
to the cathedral, who&s;e fretted windows
and ornamented &s;pires appeared to clo&s;e
the per&s;pective. Other large and detached
buildings &s;kirted the gardens on the left,
while, on the right, &s;pacious olive-grounds
and vineyards &s;pread to the cliffs that form|ed
a barrier to all this &s;ide of the domain of
the convent.</P>
<P>The friar, her conductor, cro&s;&s;ed the
court to the north wing, and there ringing
a bell, a door was opened by a nun, into
<PB N="165" REF="176">
who&s;e hands Ellena was given. A &s;igni|ficant
look was exchanged between the de|votees,
but no words; the friar departed,
and the nun, &s;till &s;ilent, conducted her
through many &s;olitary pa&s;&s;ages, where not
even a di&s;tant foot-fall echoed, and who&s;e
walls were roughly painted with &s;ubjects
indicatory of the &s;evere &s;uper&s;titions of the
place, tending to in&s;pire melancholy awe.
Ellena's hope of pity vani&s;hed as her eyes
glanced over the&s;e &s;ymbols of the di&s;po&s;ition
of the inhabitants, and on the countenance
of the nun characteri&s;ed by a gloomy ma|lignity,
which &s;eemed ready to inflict upon
others &s;ome portion of the unhappine&s;s &s;he
her&s;elf &s;uffered. As &s;he glided forward
with &s;oundle&s;s &s;tep, her white drapery, float|ing
along the&s;e &s;olemn avenues, and her
hollow features touched with the mingled
light and &s;hadow which the partial rays of
a taper &s;he held occa&s;ioned, &s;he &s;eemed like
a &s;pectre newly ri&s;en from the grave, rather
than a living being. The&s;e pa&s;&s;ages termi|nated
in the parlour of the Abbe&s;s, where
<PB N="166" REF="177">
the nun pau&s;ed, and, turning to Ellena,
&s;aid, &startq;It is the hour of ve&s;pers; you will
wait here till our lady of the convent leaves
the church; &s;he would &s;peak with you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To what &s;aint is the convent dedicat|ed,&endq;
&s;aid Ellena, &startq;and who, &s;i&s;ter, pre&s;ides
over it?&endq;</P>
<P>The nun gave no reply, and after
having eyed the forlorn &s;tranger for a
moment, with inqui&s;itive ill-nature, quitted
the room. The unhappy Ellena had not
been left long to her own reflections, when
the Abbe&s;s appeared; a &s;tately lady, appa|rently
occupied with opinions of her own
importance, and prepared to receive her
gue&s;t with rigour and &s;upercilious haughti|ne&s;s.
This Abbe&s;s, who was her&s;elf a
woman of &s;ome di&s;tinction, believed that of
all po&s;&s;ible crimes, next to that of &s;acrilege,
offences again&s;t per&s;ons of rank were lea&s;t
pardonable. It is not &s;urpri&s;ing, therefore,
that, &s;uppo&s;ing Ellena, a young woman of no
family, to have &s;ought clande&s;tinely to unite
her&s;elf with the noble hou&s;e of Vivaldi, &s;he
<PB N="167" REF="178">
&s;hould feel for her, not only di&s;dain, but
indignation, and that &s;he &s;hould readily
con&s;ent, not only to puni&s;h the offender,
but at the &s;ame time, to afford means
of pre&s;erving the ancient dignity of the
offended.</P>
<P>&startq;I under&s;tand,&endq; &s;aid the Abbe&s;s, on
who&s;e appearance the alarmed Ellena had
ari&s;en, &startq;I under&s;tand,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, without
making any &s;ignal for her to be &s;eated,
&startq;that you are the young per&s;on who is
arrived from Naples.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My name is Ellena di Ro&s;alba,&endq; &s;aid
her auditor, recovering &s;ome degree of
courage from the manner which was de|&s;igned
to depre&s;s her.</P>
<P>&startq;I know nothing of your name,&endq; re|plied
the Superior; &startq;I am informed only
that you are &s;ent here to acquire a know|ledge
of your&s;elf and of your duties. Till
the period &s;hall be pa&s;&s;ed, for which you
are given into my charge, I &s;hall &s;crupulou&s;ly
ob&s;erve the obligations of the trouble&s;ome
office, which my regard for the honour of
<PB N="168" REF="179">
a noble family, has induced me to under|take.&endq;</P>
<P>By the&s;e words, the author and the mo|tives
of this extraordinary tran&s;action were
at once revealed to Ellena, who was for &s;ome
moments almo&s;t overwhelmed by the &s;ud|den
horrors that gathered on her mind, and
&s;tood &s;ilent and motionle&s;s. Fear, &s;hame,
and indignation, alternately a&s;&s;ailed her;
and the &s;ting of offended honour, on being
&s;u&s;pected, and thus accu&s;ed of having volun|tarily
di&s;turbed the tranquillity, and &s;ought
the alliance of any family, and e&s;pecially of
one who di&s;dained her, &s;truck forcibly to
her heart, till the pride of con&s;cious worth
revived her courage and fortified her pa|tience,
and &s;he demanded by who&s;e will
&s;he had been torn from her home, and by
who&s;e authority &s;he was now detained, as
it appeared, a pri&s;oner.</P>
<P>The Abbe&s;s, unaccu&s;tomed to have her
power oppo&s;ed, or her words que&s;tioned,
was for a moment too indignant to reply;
and Ellena ob&s;erved, but no longer with
<PB N="169" REF="180">
di&s;may, the brooding tempe&s;t ready to bur&s;t
over her head, &startq;It is I only, who am in|jured,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he to her&s;elf, &startq;and shall the
guilty oppre&s;&s;or triumph, and the innocent
&s;ufferer &s;ink under the &s;hame that belongs
only to guilt! Never will I yield to a weak|ne&s;s
&s;o contemptible. The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
of de&s;erving well will recall my pre&s;ence
of mind, which, permitting me to e&s;timate
the characters of my oppre&s;&s;ors by their
actions, will enable me al&s;o to de&s;pi&s;e their
power.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t remind you,&endq; &s;aid the Abbe&s;s,
at length, &startq;that the que&s;tions you make
are unbecoming in your &s;ituation; and
that contrition and humility are the be&s;t
extenuations of error. You may with|draw.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mo&s;t true&endq; replied Ellena, bowing
with dignity to the Superior; &startq;and I mo&s;t
willingly re&s;ign them to my oppre&s;&s;ors.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena forbore to make further enquiry
or remon&s;trance, and perceiving that re|proach
would not only be u&s;ele&s;s, but de|grading
<PB N="170" REF="181">
to her&s;elf, &s;he immediately obeyed
the mandate of the Abbe&s;s, and determin|ed,
&s;ince &s;he mu&s;t &s;uffer, to &s;uffer, if po&s;|&s;ible,
with firmne&s;s and dignity.</P>
<P>She was conducted from the parlour by
the nun who had admitted her, and as &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed through the refectory where the
nuns, ju&s;t returned from ve&s;pers, were
a&s;&s;embled, their inqui&s;itive glances, their
&s;miles and bu&s;y whi&s;pers, told her, that &s;he
was not only an object of curio&s;ity, but of
&s;u&s;picion, and that little &s;ympathy could be
expected from hearts, which even the offices
of hourly devotion had not purified from
the malignant envy, that taught them to
exalt them&s;elves upon the humiliation of
others.</P>
<P>The little room, to which Ellena was led,
and where, to her great &s;atisfaction, &s;he
was left alone, rather de&s;erved the deno|mination
of a cell than of a chamber;
&s;ince like tho&s;e of the nuns, it had only
one &s;mall lattice; and a mattre&s;s, one chair,
and a table, with a crucifix and a prayer|book
<PB N="171" REF="182">
were all its furniture. Ellena, as
&s;he &s;urveyed her melancholy habitation,
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed a ri&s;ing &s;igh, but &s;he could not
remain unaffected by recollections, which,
on this view of her altered &s;tate, crowded
to her mind; nor think of Vivaldi far away,
perhaps for ever, and probably, even igno|rant
of her de&s;tination, without bitter tears.
But &s;he dried them, as the idea of the Mar|che&s;a
obtruded on her thoughts, for other
emotions than tho&s;e of grief po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed her.
It was to the Marche&s;a that &s;he e&s;pecially
attributed her pre&s;ent &s;ituation; and it now
appeared, that the family of Vivaldi had
not only been reluctant, but ab&s;olutely
aver&s;e to a connection with hers, contrary
to the sugge&s;tions of Signora Bianchi, who
had repre&s;ented, that it might be &s;uppo&s;ed
only, from their known character, that they
would di&s;approve of the alliance, but would
of cour&s;e be reconciled to an event, which
their haughtie&s;t di&s;plea&s;ure never could re|voke.
This di&s;covery of their ab&s;olute re|jection
awakened all the proper pride,
<PB N="172" REF="183">
which the mi&s;taken prudence of her aunt,
and her affection for Vivaldi had lulled to
re&s;t; and &s;he now &s;uffered the mo&s;t acute
vexation and remor&s;e, for having yielded
her con&s;ent to enter clande&s;tinely into any
family. The imaginary honours of &s;o noble
an alliance vani&s;hed, when the terms of
obtaining them were con&s;idered; and now,
that the &s;ound mind of Ellena was left to
its own judgment, &s;he looked with infinitely
more pride and preference upon the indu&s;|trious
means, which had hitherto rendered
her independent, than on all di&s;tinction
which might be relunctantly conferred.
The con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innocence, which had
&s;upported her in the pre&s;ence of the Supe|rior,
began to falter. &startq;Her accu&s;ation
was partly ju&s;t!&endq; &s;aid Ellena, &startq;and I de|&s;erve
puni&s;hment, &s;ince I could, even for a
moment, &s;ubmit to the humiliation of de|&s;iring
an alliance, which I knew would be
unwillingly conferred. But it is not yet
too late to retrieve my own e&s;teem by a&s;|&s;erting
my independence, and re&s;igning Vi|valdi
<PB N="173" REF="184">
for ever. By re&s;igning him! by
abandoning him who loves me,&mdash;abandon|ing
him to mi&s;ery! &startq;Him, whom I cannot
even think of without tears,&mdash;to whom my
vows: have been given,&mdash;who may claim
me by the &s;acred remembrance of my dying
friend,&mdash;him, to whom my whole heart is
devoted! O! mi&s;erable alternative!&mdash;that
I can no longer act ju&s;tly, but at the ex|pence
of all my future happine&s;s! Ju&s;tly!
And Would it then be ju&s;t to abandon him
who is willing to re&s;ign every thing for
me,&mdash;abandon him to cea&s;ele&s;s &s;orrow, that
the prejudices of his family may be grati|fied?&endq;</P>
<P>Poor Ellena perceived that me could not
obey the dictates of a ju&s;t pride, without
&s;uch oppo&s;ition from her heart as &s;he had
never experienced before. Her affections
were now too deeply engaged to permit her
to act with firmne&s;s, at the price of long-&s;uffering.
The con&s;ideration of re&s;igning
Vivaldi was &s;o very grievous, that &s;he could
&s;carcely endure to pau&s;e upon it for a mo|ment;
<PB N="174" REF="185">
yet, on the other hand, when &s;he
thought of his family, it appeared that &s;he
never could con&s;ent to make a part of it.
She would have blamed the erroneous
judgment of Signora Bianchi, who&s;e per|&s;ua&s;ions
had &s;o much a&s;&s;i&s;ted in reducing
her to the pre&s;ent alternative, had not the
tenderne&s;s with which &s;he cheri&s;hed her
memory, rendered this impo&s;&s;ible. All,
that now remained for her, was to endea|vour
patiently to endure pre&s;ent evils, which
&s;he could not conquer; for, to for&s;ake
Vivaldi as the price of liberty, &s;hould liberty
be offered her on &s;uch terms, or to accept
him in defiance of honourable pride, &s;hould
he ever effect her relea&s;e, appeared to her
di&s;tracted thoughts almo&s;t equally, imprac|ticable.
But, as the probability of his never
being able to di&s;cover her abode, returned
to her con&s;ideration, the angui&s;h &s;he &s;uffer|ed
told how much more &s;he dreaded to lo&s;e
than to accept Vivaldi, and that love was,
after all, the mo&s;t powerful affection of her heart.</P>

<Q>&startq;The bell then beating one!&endq;
<BIBL>SHAKESPEARE.</BIBL></Q>
<P>VIVALDI, meanwhile, ignorant of what
had occurred at villa Altieri, repaired as he
had propo&s;ed, to Paluzzi, attended by his
&s;ervant Paulo. It was deep night before he
left Naples, and &s;o anxious was he to con|ceal
him&s;elf from ob&s;ervation, that though
Paulo carried a torch, he did not permit it
to be lighted, till after he &s;hould have re|mained
&s;ome time within the arch-way,
thinking it mo&s;t prudent to watch a while
in &s;ecret for his unknown advi&s;er, before
he proceeded to examine the fort.</P>
<P>His attendant, Paulo, was a true Nea|politan,
&s;hrewd, inqui&s;itive, insinuating,
adroit; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing much of the &s;pirit of in|trigue,
together with a con&s;iderable portion
of humour, which di&s;played it&s;elf not &s;o
<PB N="176" REF="187">
much in words, as in his manner and coun|tenance,
in the archne&s;s of his dark, pene|trating
eye, and in the exqui&s;ite adaptation
of his ge&s;ture to his idea. He was a di&s;tin|gui&s;hed
favourite with his ma&s;ter, who, if
he had not humour him&s;elf, had a keen re|li&s;h
of it in others, and who certainly did
po&s;&s;e&s;s wit, with all its lively accompani|ments,
in an eminent degree. Vivaldi had
been won by the <HI>na&iuml;vete</HI> and humour of
this man, to allow him an unu&s;ual degree
of familiarity in convention; and, as they
now walked together towards Paluzzi, he
unfolded to Paulo as much of his former
adventure there as he judged nece&s;&s;ary to
intere&s;t his curio&s;ity and excite his vigi|lance.
The relation did both. Paulo,
however, naturally courageous, was in|credulous
to &s;uper&s;tition of any kind; and,
having quickly perceived that his ma&s;ter
was not altogether indi&s;po&s;ed to attribute
to a &s;upernatural cau&s;e the extraordinary
occurrences at Paluzzi, he began, in his
manner, to rally him; but Vivaldi was not
<PB N="177" REF="188">
in temper to endure je&s;ting; his mood was
grave, even to &s;olemnity, and he yielded,
though reluctantly, to the awe which, at
intervals, returned upon him with the force
of a magical &s;pell, binding up all his facul|ties
to &s;ternne&s;s, and fixing them in expecta|tion.
While he was nearly regardle&s;s of
defence again&s;t human agency, his &s;ervant
was, however, preparing for that alone;
and very properly repre&s;ented the impru|dence
of going to Paluzzi in darkne&s;s.
Vivaldi ob&s;erved that they could not watch
for the monk otherwi&s;e than in darkne&s;s,
&s;ince the torch which lighted them would
al&s;o warn him, and he had very particular
rea&s;ons for watching before he proceeded
to examine. He added, that after a certain
time had elap&s;ed, the torch might be lighted
at a neighbouring cottage. Paulo objected,
that in the meanwhile, the per&s;on for whom
they watched might e&s;cape; and Vivaldi com|promi&s;ed
the affair. The torch was lighted,
but concealed within a hallow of the cliffs,
that bordered the road, and the centinels
<PB N="178" REF="189">
took their &s;tation in darkne&s;s, within the
deep arch, near the &s;pot where Vivaldi had
watched with Bonarmo. As they did this,
the di&s;tant chime of a convent informed
Vivaldi that midnight was turned. The
&s;ound recalled to his mind the words of
Schedoni, concerning the vicinity of the
convent of the <HI>Black Penitents,</HI> to Paluzzi,
and he a&s;ked Paulo whether this was the
chime of that convent. Paulo replied that
it was, and that a remarkable circum&s;tance
had taught him to remember <HI>the Santa del
Pianto, or Our Lady of Tears.</HI> &startq;The
place, Signor, would intere&s;t you,&endq; &s;aid
Paulo; &startq;for there are &s;ome odd &s;tories told
of it; and I am inclined to think, this un|known
monk mu&s;t be one of that &s;ociety,
his conduct is &s;o &s;trange.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You believe then, that I am willing to
give faith to wonderful &s;tories,&endq; &s;aid Vi|valdi,
&s;miling. &startq;But what have you heard,
that is &s;o extraordinary, re&s;pecting this con|vent?
Speak low, or we may be di&s;|covered.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="190">
&startq;Why, Signor, the &s;tory is not gene|rally
known,&endq; &s;aid Paulo in a whi&s;per;
&startq;I half promi&s;ed never to reveal it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If you are under any promi&s;e of &s;e|cre&s;y,&endq;
interrupted Vivaldi, &startq;I forbid you
to tell this wonderful tale, which, however,
&s;eems &s;omewhat too big to re&s;t within your
brain.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;tory would fain expand it&s;elf to
your's, Signor,&endq; &s;aid Paulo; &startq;and, as I
did not ab&s;olutely promi&s;e to conceal it,
I am very willing to reveal it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Proceed, then,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi; &startq;but
let me once more caution you to &s;peak
low.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are obeyed, Signor. You mu&s;t
know, then, <HI>Mae&s;tro,</HI> that it was on the eve
of the fe&s;tival of <HI>Santo Marco,</HI> and about
&s;ix years &s;ince&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Peace!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi. They were &s;i|lent;
but every thing remaining &s;till, Paulo,
a&s;ter &s;ome time, ventured to proceed, though
in a yet lower whi&s;per. &startq;It was on the eve
of the <HI>Santo Marco,</HI> and when the la&s;t bell
<PB N="180" REF="191">
had rung, that a per&s;on&endq;&mdash;He &s;topped
again, for a ru&s;tling &s;ound pa&s;&s;ed near him.</P>
<P>&startq;You are too late,&endq; &s;aid a &s;udden voice
be&s;ide Vivaldi, who in&s;tantly recognized the
thrilling accents of the monk.&mdash;&startq;It is pa&s;t
midnight; &s;he departed an hour ago. Look
to your &s;teps!&endq;.</P>
<P>Though thrilled by this well-known
voice, Vivaldi &s;carcely yielded to his feel|ings
for a moment, but, checking the que&s;|tion
which would have a&s;ked &startq;who de|parted?&endq;
he, by a &s;udden &s;pring, endea|voured
to &s;eize the intruder, while Paulo, in
the fir&s;t hurry of his alarm, fired a pi&s;tol, and
then ha&s;tened for the torch. So certainly did
Vivaldi believe him&s;elf to have leaped upon
the &s;pot whence the voice proceeded, that, on
reaching it, he in&s;tantly extended his arms,
and &s;earching around, expected every mo|ment
to find his enemy in his gra&s;p. Dark|ne&s;s
again baffled his attempt.</P>
<P>&startq;You are known,&endq; cried Vivaldi;
&startq;you &s;hall &s;ee me at the <HI>Santa dell
Pianto!</HI> What, oh! Paulo, the torch!&mdash;The
torch!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="192">
Paulo, &s;wift as the wind, appeared with
it. &startq;He pa&s;&s;ed up tho&s;e &s;teps in the rock,
Signor; I &s;aw the &s;kirts of his garments
a&s;cending!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Follow me, then,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi,
mounting the &s;teps. &startq;Away, away,
<HI>Maestro!&endq;</HI> &s;aid Paulo, impatiently; &startq;but,
for Heaven's &s;ake, name no more the con|vent
of the <HI>Santa dell Pianto;</HI> our lives
may an&s;wer it!&endq;</P>
<P>He followed to the terrace above, where
Vivaldi, holding high the torch, looked
round for the monk. The place, however,
as far as his eye could penetrate, was for|&s;aken
and &s;ilent. The glare of the torch,
enlightened only the rude walls of the cita|del,
&s;ome points of the cliff below, and &s;ome
tall pines that waved over them, leaving in
doubtful gloom many a rece&s;s of the ruin,
and many a tangled thicket, that &s;pread
among the rocks beyond.</P>
<P>&startq;Do you perceive any per&s;on, Paulo?&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi, waving the torch in the air to
rou&s;e the flame.</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="193">
&startq;Among tho&s;e arches on the left,
Signor, tho&s;e arches that &s;tand du&s;kily
beyond the citadel, I thought I &s;aw a &s;ha|dowy
&s;ort of a figure pa&s;s. He might be a
gho&s;t, by his &s;ilence, for aught I know,
<HI>Mae&s;tro;</HI> but he &s;eems to have a good
mortal in&s;tinct in taking care of him&s;elf,
and to have as &s;wift a pair of heels to a&s;&s;i&s;t
in carrying him off, as any Lazaro in Naples
need de&s;ire.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Fewer words, and more caution!&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi, lowering the torch, and point|ing
it towards the quarter which Paulo had
mentioned. &startq;Be vigilant, and tread light|ly.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are obeyed, Signor; but their
eyes will inform them, though their ears
refu&s;e, while we hold a light to our own
&s;teps.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Peace, with this buffoonery|&endq; &s;aid
Vivaldi, &s;omewhat &s;ternly; &startq;follow in &s;i|lence,
and be on your guard.&endq;</P>
<P>Paulo &s;ubmitted, and they proceeded to|wards
the range of arches, which commu|nicated
<PB N="183" REF="194">
with the building, who&s;e &s;i $gular
&s;tructure had formerly arre&s;ted the atten|tion
of Bonarmo, and whence Vivaldi him|&s;elf
had returned with &s;uch unexpected
precipitancy and consternation.</P>
<P>On perceiving the place he was ap|proaching,
he &s;uddenly, &s;topped, and Paulo
ob&s;erving his agitation, and probably not
reli&s;hing the adventure, endeavoured to di&s;|&s;uade
him from further re&s;earch: &startq;For we
know not who may inhabit this gloomy
place, Signor, or their numbers, and we are
only two of us after all! Be&s;ides, Signor,
it was through that door, yonder;&endq; and
he pointed to the very &s;pot whence Vivaldi
had &s;o fearfully i&s;&s;ued; &startq;through that
door, that I fancied, ju&s;t now, I &s;aw &s;ome|thing
pa&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are you certain as to this?&endq; &s;aid Vi|valdi,
with increa&s;ed emotion. &startq;What
was its form?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It was &s;o du&s;ky thereabout, <HI>Mae&s;tro,</HI>
that I could not di&s;tingui&s;h.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="195">
Vivaldi's eyes were fixed upon the build|ing,
and a violent conflict of feelings &s;eemed
to &s;hake his &s;oul. A few &s;econds decided
it. &startq;I will go on,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;and termi|nate,
at any hazard, this &s;tate of intolerable
anxiety. Paulo, pau&s;e a moment, and con|&s;ider
well whether you can depend on
your courage, for it may be &s;everely tried.
If you can, de&s;cend with me in &s;ilence:, and
I warn you to be wary; if you cannot, I
will go alone.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is too late now, Signor, to a&s;k my|&s;elf
that que&s;tion,&endq; replied Paulo, with a
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive air; &startq;and if I had not &s;ettled it
long ago, I &s;hould not have followed you
thus far. My courage, Signor, you never
doubted before.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Come on then,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi. He
drew his &s;word, and entering the narrow
door-way, the torch, which he had now re|&s;igned
to Paulo, &s;hewed a &s;tone pa&s;&s;age,
that was, however, interminable to the
eye.</P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="196">
&startq;As they proceeded, Paulo ob&s;erved, that
the walls were &s;tained in &s;everal places with,
what appeared, to be blood, but prudently
forbore to point this out to his ma&s;ter, ob|&s;erving
the &s;trict injunction of &s;ilence he had
received.</P>
<P>Vivaldi &s;tepped cautiou&s;ly, and often
pau&s;ed to li&s;ten, after which he went on
with a quicker pace, making &s;igns only to,
Paulo to follow, and be vigilant. The pa&s;|&s;age
terminated in a &s;tair-ca&s;e, that &s;eemed
to lead to vaults below. Vivaldi remem|bered
the light which had formerly ap|peared
there, and, as recollection of the
past gathered on his mind, he faultered in
his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Again he pau&s;ed, looked back upon
Paulo, but was going forward, when Paulo
him&s;elf &s;eized his arm. &startq;Stop! Signor,&endq;
&s;aid he in a low voice. &startq;Do you not di&s;|tingui&s;h
a figure &s;tanding yonder, in the
gloom.?&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked onward, and perceived,
indi&s;tinctly, &s;omething as of human form,
<PB N="186" REF="197">
but motionle&s;s and &s;ilent. It &s;tood at the
du&s;ky extremity of the avenue, near the
&s;tair-ca&s;e. Its garments, if garments they
were, were dark; but its whole figure was
&s;o faintly traced to the eye, that it was im|po&s;&s;ible
to a&s;certain whether this was the
monk. Vivaldi took the light, and held it
forward, endeavouring to di&s;tinguish the
object before he ventured further; but the
enquiry was u&s;ele&s;s, and, re&s;igning the torch
to Paulo, he ru&s;hed on. When he reached
the head of the &s;tair-ca&s;e, however, the form,
whatever it might be, was gone. Vivaldi
had heard no foot&s;tep. Paulo pointed out
the exact &s;pot where it had &s;tood, but no
ve&s;tige of it appeared. Vivaldi called loudly
upon the monk, but he heard only the
lengthening echoes of his own voice revolv|ing
among the chambers below, and, after
he&s;itating a while on the head of the &s;tairs,
he de&s;cended.</P>
<P>Paulo had not followed down many &s;teps,
when he called out, &startq;It is there! Signor;
<PB N="187" REF="198">
I &s;ee it again! and now it flits away through
the door that opens to the vaults!&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi pur&s;ued &s;o &s;wiftly, that Paulo
could &s;carcely follow fa&s;t enough with the
light; and, as at length he re&s;ted to take
breath, he perceived him&s;elf in the &s;ame
&s;pacious chamber to which he had for|merly
de&s;cended. At this moment Paulo
perceived his countenance change. &startq;You
are ill, Signor,&endq; &s;aid he. &startq;In the name of
our holy Saint, let us quit this hideous place.
Its inhabitants can be nothing good, and no
good can come of our remaining here.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi made no reply; he drew breath
with difficulty, and his eyes remained fixed
on the ground, till a noi&s;e, like the creaking
of a heavy hinge, ro&s;e in a di&s;tant part of the
vault. Paulo turned his eyes, at the &s;ame
in&s;tant, towards the place whence it came,
and they both perceived, a door in the wall
&s;lowly opened, and immediately clo&s;ed again,
as if the per&s;on within had feared to be di&s;|covered.
Each believed, from the tran&s;ient
view he had of it, that this was the &s;ame
<PB N="188" REF="199">
figure which had appeared on the &s;tair-ca&s;e,
and that it was the monk him&s;elf. Re|animated
by this belief, Vivaldi's nerves
were in&s;tantly rebraced, and he &s;prang to
the door, which was unfa&s;tened, and yielded
immediately to his impetuous hand. &startq;You
&s;hall not deceive me now,&endq; cried he, as he
entered; &startq;Paulo! keep guard at the
door!&endq;</P>
<P>He looked round the &s;econd vault, in
which he now found him&s;elf, but no per&s;on
appeared; he examined the place, and par|ticularly
the walls, without di&s;covering any
aperture, either of door or window, by which
the figure could have quitted the chamber;
a &s;trongly-grated ca&s;ement, placed near the
roof, was all that admitted air, and probably
light. Vivaldi was a&s;toni&s;hed! &startq;Have you
&s;een any thing pa&s;s?&endq; &s;aid he to Paulo.</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing, <HI>Maestro,</HI> replied the &s;er|vant.</P>
<P>&startq;This is almo&s;t incredible,&endq; exclaimed
Vivaldi; &startq;`tis certain, this form can be
nothing human!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="200">
&startq;If &s;o, Signor,&endq; ob&s;erved Paulo, &startq;why
&s;hould it fear us? as &s;urely it does; or why
should it have fled?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is not &s;o certain,&endq; rejoined Vi|valdi;
&startq;it may have fled only to lead us
into evil. But bring hither the torch; here
is &s;omething in the wall which I would exa|mine.&endq;</P>
<P>Paulo obeyed. It was merely a rugged|ne&s;s
in the &s;tones, not the partition of a
door, that had excited his curio&s;ity. &startq;This
is inexplicable!&endq; exclaimed Vivaldi, after
a long pau&s;e. &startq;What motive could any
human being have for thus tormenting
me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Or any being &s;uperhuman, either, my
Signor?&endq; &s;aid Paulo.</P>
<P>&startq;I am warned of evils that await me,&endq;
continued Vivaldi, mu&s;ing; &startq;of events
that are regularly fulfilled; the being who
warns me, cro&s;&s;es my path perpetually, yet,
with the cunning of a demon, as con&s;tantly
eludes my gra&s;p, and baffles my pur&s;uit!
It is incomprehen&s;ible, by what means he
<PB N="190" REF="201">
glides thus away from my eye, and fades,
as if into air, at my approach! He is re|peatedly
in my pre&s;ence, yet is never to be
found!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is mo&s;t true, Signor,&endq; &s;aid Paulo,
&startq;that he is never to be found, and there|fore
let me entreat you to give up the pur|&s;uit.
This place is enough to make one
believe in the horrors of purgatory! Let
us go, Signor.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What but &s;pirit could have quitted
this vault &s;o my&s;teriou&s;ly,&endq; continued Vi|valdi,
not attending to Paulo; &startq;what but
&s;pirit!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;I would fain prove,&endq; &s;aid the &s;ervant,
that &s;ub&s;tance can quit it as ea&s;ily; I
would fain evaporate through that door
my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>He had &s;carcely &s;poken the words, when
the door clo&s;ed, with a thundering clap
that echoed through all the vaults; and
Vivaldi and Paulo stood for a moment
agha&s;t! and then both ha&s;tened to open it,
and to leave the place. Their con&s;ternation
<PB N="191" REF="202">
may be ea&s;ily conceived, when they found
that all their efforts at the door, were in|effectual.
The thick wood was inlaid with
&s;olid bars of iron; and was of &s;uch un|conquerable
&s;trength, that it evidently,
guarded what had been de&s;igned for a pri|&s;on,
and appeared to be the keep or dun|geon
of the ancient fort.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Signor mio!&endq; &s;aid Paulo, &startq;if this was
a &s;pirit, 'tis plain he knew we were not &s;o,
by his luring us hither. Would we could
exchange natures with him for a moment;
for I know not how, as mere mortal men,
we can ever &s;queeze our&s;elves out of this
&s;crape. You mu&s;t allow, <HI>Mae&s;tro,</HI> that
this was not one of the evils he warned you
of; or, if he did, it was through my or|gans,
for I entreated you.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Peace, good Signor <HI>Buffo!&endq;</HI> &s;aid. Vi|valdi;
&startq;a truce with this non&s;en&s;e, and
a&s;&s;i&s;t in &s;earching for &s;ome means, of
e&s;cape.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi again examined the walls, and as
un&s;ucce&s;sfully as before; but in one corner
<PB N="192" REF="203">
of the vault lay an object, which &s;eemed to
tell the fate of one who had been confined
here, and to hint his own: it was a gar|ment
covered with blood. Vivaldi and his
&s;ervant di&s;covered it at the &s;ame in&s;tant;
and a dreadful foreboding of their own de|&s;tiny
fixed them, for &s;ome moments, to the
&s;pot. Vivaldi fir&s;t recovered him&s;elf, when
in&s;tead of yielding to de&s;pondency, all his
faculties were arou&s;ed to devi&s;e &s;ome means
for e&s;caping; but Paulo's hopes &s;eemed
buried beneath the dreadful ve&s;tments upon
which he &s;till gazed. &startq;Ah, my Signor!&endq;
&s;aid he, at length, in a faultering accent,
&startq;who &s;hall dare to rai&s;e that garment?
What if it &s;hould conceal the mangled
body who&s;e blood has stained it!&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, &s;hudderingly, turned to look on
it again.</P>
<P>&startq;It moves?&endq; exclaimed Paulo; &startq;I &s;ee
it move!&endq; as he &s;aid which, he &s;tarted to
the oppo&s;ite &s;ide of the chamber. Vivaldi
&s;tepped a few paces back, and as quickly
returned; when, determined to know the
<PB N="193" REF="204">
event at once, he rai&s;ed the, garment upon
the point of his &s;word, and perceived, be|neath,
other remains of dre&s;s, heaped high
together, while even the floor below was
&s;tained with gore.</P>
<P>Believing that fear had deceived the
eyes of Paulo, Vivaldi watched this hor|rible
&s;pectacle for &s;ome time, but with|out,
perceiving the lea&s;t motion; when he
became convinced, that not any remains of
life were &s;hrouded beneath it, and that it
contained only articles of dre&s;s, which had
belonged to &s;ome unfortunate per&s;on, who
had probably been decoyed hither for plun|der,
and afterwards murdered. This be|lief,
and the repugnance he felt to dwell
upon the &s;pectacle, prevented him from
examining further, and he turned away to
a remote part of the vault. A conviction of
his own fate, and of his &s;ervant's, filled his
mind for a while with de&s;pair. It appeared
that he had been en&s;nared by robbers, till,
as he recollected the circum&s;tances which
had attended his entrance, and the &s;everal
<PB N="194" REF="205">
peculiar occurrences connected with the
arch-way, this conjecture &s;eemed highly im|probable.
It was unrea&s;onable, that robbers
&s;hould have taken the trouble to decoy, when
they might at fir&s;t have &s;eized him; &s;till more
&s;o, that they would have per&s;evered &s;o long
in the attempt; and mo&s;t of all, that when
he had formerly been in their power, they
&s;hould have neglected their opportunity, and
&s;uffered him to leave the ruin unmole&s;ted.
Yet, granting that all this, improbable as it
was, were, however, po&s;&s;ible, the &s;olemn
warnings and predictions of the monk, &s;o
frequently delivered, and &s;o faithfully ful|filled,
could have no connection with the
&s;chemes of banditti. It appeared, therefore,
that Vivaldi was not in the hands of rob|bers;
or, if he were, that the monk, at
lea&s;t, had no connection with them; yet it
was certain that he had ju&s;t heard the voice
of this monk beneath the arch; that his
&s;ervant had &s;aid, he &s;aw the ve&s;tments of
one a&s;cending the &s;teps of the fort; and
that they had both rea&s;on, afterward, to
<PB N="195" REF="206">
believe if was his &s;hadowy figure, which
they had pur&s;ued to the very chamber
where they were now confined.</P>
<P>As Vivaldi con&s;idered all the&s;e circum|&s;tances,
his perplexity encrea&s;ed, and he
was more than ever inclined to believe, that
the form, which had a&s;&s;umed the appear|ance
of a monk, was &s;omething &s;uper|human.</P>
<P>&startq;If this being had <HI>appeared only,&endq;</HI> &s;aid
he to him&s;elf, &startq;I &s;hould, perhaps, have
thought it the perturbed &s;pirit of him, who
doubtle&s;s has been murdered here, and that
it led me hither to di&s;cover the deed, that
his bones might be removed to holy ground;
but this monk, or whatever it is, was neither
&s;ilent, nor apparently anxious concerning
him&s;elf; he &s;poke only of events connected
with my peace, and predicted of the future,
as well as reverted to the pa&s;t! If he had
either hinted of him&s;elf, or had been wholly
&s;ilent, his appearance, and manner of elud|ing
pur&s;uit, is &s;o extraordinary, that I
&s;hould have yielded, for once, perhaps, to
<PB N="194" REF="207">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="195" REF="208">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="196" REF="209">
the tales of our grandfathers, and thought
he was the &s;pectre of a murdered per&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>As Vivaldi expre&s;&s;ed his incredulity,
however, he returned to examine the gar|ment
once more, when, as he rai&s;ed it,
he ob&s;erved, what had before e&s;caped his
notice, black drapery mingled with the
heap beneath; and, on lifting this al&s;o on
the point of his &s;word, he perceived part of
the habiliment of a monk! He &s;tarted at
the di&s;covery, as if he had &s;een the appari|tion,
which had &s;o long been tempting his
credulity. Here were the ve&s;t and &s;capu|lary,
rent and &s;tained with blood! Having
gazed for a moment, he let them drop
upon the heap; when Paulo, who had
been &s;ilently ob&s;erving him, exclaimed,</P>
<P>&startq;Signor! that &s;hould be the garment of
the demon who led us hither. Is it a wind|ing-&s;heet
for us, <HI>Mae&s;tro?</HI> Or was it one
for the body he inhabited while on earth!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Neither, I tru&s;t,&endq; replied Vivaldi, en|deavouring
to command the perturbation
he &s;uffered, and turning from the &s;pectacle;
<PB N="197" REF="210">
&startq;therefore we will try once more to re|gain
our liberty.&endq;</P>
<P>This was a de&s;ign, however, beyond his
accompli&s;hment; and, having again attacked
the door, rai&s;ed Paulo to the grated win|dow,
and vociferated for relea&s;e with his
utmo&s;t &s;trength, in which he was very ably
&s;econded by Paulo, he abandoned, for the
pre&s;ent, all further attempts, and, weary
and de&s;ponding, threw him&s;elf on the ground
of the dungeon.</P>
<P>Paulo bitterly lamented his ma&s;ter's ra&s;h|ne&s;s
in penetrating to this remote &s;pot, and
bewailed the probability of their being fa|mi&s;hed.</P>
<P>&startq;For, &s;uppo&s;ing, Signor, that we were
not decoyed hither for plunder and butch|ery,
and &s;uppo&s;ing that we are not &s;ur|rounded
by malicious &s;pirits, which San
Januarius forbid I &s;hould take upon me to
affirm is impo&s;&s;ible! &s;uppo&s;ing all this, Sig|nor,
yet &s;till there remains almo&s;t a cer|tainty
of our being &s;tarved to death; for
how is it po&s;&s;ible that any body can hear
<PB N="198" REF="211">
our cries, in a place &s;o remote from all re&s;ort,
and buried, as one may &s;ay, under ground,
as this is?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Thou art an excellent comforter,&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi, groaning.</P>
<P>&startq;You mu&s;t allow, Signor, that you are
even with me,&endq; replied Paulo; &startq;and that
you are as excellent a conductor.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi gave no an&s;wer, but lay on
the ground, abandoned to agonizing
thought. He had now lei&s;ure to con&s;ider
the late words of the monk, and to con|jecture,
for he was in a mood for con|jecturing
the wor&s;t, that they not only
alluded to Ellena, but that his &s;aying
&startq;&s;he had departed an hour ago,&endq; was a
figurative manner of telling that &s;he had
died then. This was a conjecture which di&s;|pelled
almo&s;t all apprehen&s;ion for him&s;elf.
He &s;tarted from the ground, and paced his
pri&s;on with quick and unequal &s;teps; it
was now no longer a heavy de&s;pondency
that oppre&s;&s;ed him, but an acute anxiety
<PB N="199" REF="212">
that &s;tung him, and, with the tortures of
&s;u&s;pen&s;e, brought al&s;o tho&s;e of pa&s;&s;ionate
impatience and horror concerning the fate,
of Ellena. The longer he dwelt upon
the po&s;&s;ibility of her death, the more
probable it appeared. This monk had al|ready
forewarned him of the death of Bi|anchi;
and when he recollected the &s;u&s;|picious
circum&s;tances which had attended it,
his terrors for Ellena increa&s;ed. The more
he yielded to his feelings, the more violent
they became, till, at length, his ungovern|able
impatience and apprehen&s;ions aro&s;e al|mo&s;t
to frenzy.</P>
<P>Paulo forgot, for a while, his own &s;itua|tion
in the &s;uperior &s;ufferings of his ma&s;ter,
and now, at lea&s;t, endeavoured to perform
the offices of a comforter, for he tried to
calm Vivaldi's mind, by &s;electing the faire&s;t
circum&s;tances for hope which the &s;ubject
admitted, and he pa&s;&s;ed without noticing,
or, if noticing, only lightly touched upon,
the mo&s;t prominent po&s;&s;ibilities of evil. His
ma&s;ter, however, was in&s;en&s;ible to all he
<PB N="200" REF="213">
&s;aid, till he mentioned again the convent
del Pianto; and this &s;ubject, as it &s;eemed
connected with the monk, who had hinted
the fate of Ellena, intere&s;ted the unhappy
Vivaldi, who withdrew awhile from his own
reflections, to li&s;ten to a recital which might
a&s;&s;i&s;t his conjectures.</P>
<P>Paulo complied with his command, but
not without reluctance. He looked round
the empty vault, as if he feared that &s;ome
per&s;on might be lurking in the ob&s;curity,
who would overhear, and even an&s;wer him.</P>
<P>&startq;We are tolerably retired here too,
Signor,&endq; &s;aid he, recollecting him&s;elf;
&startq;one may venture to talk &s;ecrets with
little danger of being di&s;covered. However,
<HI>Mae&s;tro,</HI> it is be&s;t to make matters quite
&s;ure; and therefore, if you will plea&s;e to
take a &s;eat on the ground, I will &s;tand be|&s;ide
you and relate all I know of the con|vent
of <HI>Our Lady of Tears,</HI> which is not
much after all.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, having &s;eated him&s;elf, and bidden
Paulo do the &s;ame, the &s;ervant began in a
<PB N="201" REF="214">
low voice&mdash;&startq;It was on the vigil of the
<HI>Santo Marco,</HI> ju&s;t after the la&s;t ve&s;per-bell had
tolled&mdash;You never was at the <HI>Santa Maria
del Pianto,</HI> Signor, or you would know
what a gloomy old church it has.&mdash;It was
in a confe&s;&s;ional in one of the &s;ide ailes of
this church, and ju&s;t after the la&s;t bell had
cea&s;ed, that a per&s;on, &s;o muffled up, that
neither face nor &s;hape could be di&s;tingui&s;hed,
came and placed him&s;elf on the &s;teps of one
of the boxes adjoining the confe&s;&s;ional chair;
but if he had been as airily dre&s;&s;ed as your|&s;elf,
Signor, he might have been ju&s;t as well
concealed; for that du&s;ky ai&s;le is lighted
only by one lamp, which hangs at the end
next the painted window, except when the
tapers at the &s;hrine of San Antonio happen
to be burning at the other extremity, and
even then the place is almo&s;t as gloomy as
this vault. But that is, no doubt, contrived
for the purpo&s;e, that people may not blu&s;h
for the &s;ins they confe&s;s; and, in good faith,
this is an accommodation which may bring
more money to the poor's box, for the
<PB N="202" REF="215">
monks have a &s;hrewd eye that way,
and&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;You have dropt the thread of your
&s;tory,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;True, Signor, let me recollect where
I lo&s;t it.&mdash;Oh! at the &s;teps of the confe&s;|&s;ional;&mdash;the
&s;tranger knelt down upon them,
and for &s;ome time poured &s;uch groans into
the ear of the confe&s;&s;or, as were heard all
along the ai&s;ie. You are to know, Signor,
that the brothers of <HI>Santa del Pianto</HI> are of
the order of <HI>Black Penitents;</HI> and people
who have more &s;ins than ordinary to con|fe&s;s,
&s;ometimes go there, to con&s;ult with
the grand penitentiary what is to be done.
Now it <HI>happened,</HI> that Father An&s;aldo, the
grand penitentiary him&s;elf, was in the
chair, as is cu&s;tomary on the vigil of the
<HI>Santo Marco;</HI> and he gently reproved the
penitent for bewailing &s;o loud, and bade
him take comfort; when the other replied
only by a groan deeper than before, but it
was not &s;o loud, and then proceeded to
confe&s;s. But what he did confe&s;s, Signor,
<PB N="203" REF="216">
I know not; for the confe&s;&s;or, you know,
never mu&s;t divulge, except, indeed, on very
extraordinary occa&s;ions. It was, however,
&s;omething &s;o very &s;trange and horrible, that
the grand penitentiary &s;uddenly quitted the
chair, and before he reached the cloi&s;ters
he fell into &s;trong convul&s;ions. On re|covering
him&s;elf, he a&s;ked the people about
him, whether the penitent, who had vi&s;ited
&s;uch a confe&s;&s;ional, naming it, was gone;
adding, that if he was &s;till in the church,
it was proper he &s;hould be detained. He
de&s;cribed, at the &s;ame time, as well as he
could, the &s;ort of figure he had dimly &s;een
approaching the confe&s;&s;ional ju&s;t before he
had received the confe&s;&s;ion, at recollecting
which, he &s;eemed ready to go off again into
his convul&s;ions. One of the fathers, who
had cro&s;&s;ed the ai&s;le, on his way to the cloi|&s;ters,
upon the fir&s;t alarm of An&s;aldo's di&s;|order,
remembered that a per&s;on, &s;uch as
was de&s;cribed, had pa&s;&s;ed him ha&s;tily. He
had &s;een a tall figure, muffled up in the ha|bit
of a white friar, gliding &s;wiftly along the
<PB N="204" REF="217">
ai&s;le, towards the door which opened into
the outer court of the convent; but he
was him&s;elf too much engaged to notice
the &s;tranger particularly. Father An&s;aldo
thought this mu&s;t be the per&s;on; and the
porter was &s;ummoned, and a&s;ked whether
he had ob&s;erved &s;uch an one pa&s;s. He af|firmed
that he had not &s;een any per&s;on go
forth from the gate within the la&s;t quarter
of an hour; which might be true enough,
you know, Signor, if the rogue had been
off his po&s;t. But he further &s;aid, that no
one had entered, during the whole even|ing,
habited in white, as the &s;tranger was
described to be: &s;o the porter proved him|&s;elf
to be a vigilant watchman; for he
mu&s;t have been fa&s;t a&s;leep too, or how
could this per&s;onage have entered the con|vent,
and left it again, without being &s;een
by him!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In white, was he?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi;
&startq;if he had been in black, I &s;hould have
thought this mu&s;t have been the monk,
my tormentor.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="205" REF="218">
&startq;Why, you know, Signor, that oc|curred
to me before,&endq; ob&s;erved Paulo,
&startq;and a man might ea&s;ily change his dre&s;s,
if that were all.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Proceed,&endq; &s;aid: Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Hearing this account from the porter,&endq;
continued Paulo, &startq;the fathers believed, one
and all, that the &s;tranger mu&s;t be &s;ecreted
within the walls; and the convent, with
every part of the precincts, was &s;earched;
but no per&s;on was found!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This mu&s;t certainly be the monk,&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;notwith&s;tanding the differ|ence
of his habit; there &s;urely cannot be
two beings in the world, who would con|duct
them&s;elves in this &s;ame my&s;terious
manner!&endq;</P>
<P>He was interrupted by a low &s;ound, which
&s;eemed, to his di&s;tracted fancy, to proceed
from a dying per&s;on. Paulo al&s;o heard it;
he &s;tarted, and they both li&s;tened with
inten&s;e and almo&s;t intolerable expectation.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah!&endq; &s;aid Paulo, at length, &startq;it was
only the wind.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="206" REF="219">
&startq;It was no more,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi;
&startq;proceed therefore.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;From the period of this &s;trange con|fe&s;&s;ion,&endq;

<P>&startq;Doubtle&s;s the crime confe&s;&s;ed related
to him&s;elf,&endq; ob&s;erved Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, no, Signor, I never heard that
that was the ca&s;e; and &s;ome remarkable
circum&s;tances, which followed, &s;eemed to
prove it otherwi&s;e. About a month after
the time I have mentioned, on the evening
of a &s;ultry day, when the monks were re|tiring
from the la&s;t &s;ervice&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Hark!&endq; cried Vivaldi.</P>
<P>&startq;I hear whi&s;pers,&endq; &s;aid Paulo, whi&s;per|ing
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;Be &s;till!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.</P>
<P>They li&s;tened attentively, and heard a
murmuring, as of voices; but could not
a&s;certain whether they came from the ad|joining
vault, or aro&s;e from beneath the one
in which they were. The &s;ound returned
at intervals; and the per&s;ons who con|ver&s;ed,
<PB N="207" REF="220">
whatever they were, &s;eemingly re|&s;trained
their voices, as if they feared to be
heard. Vivaldi con&s;idered whether it were
better to di&s;cover him&s;elf, and call for a&s;|&s;i&s;tance,
or to remain &s;till.</P>
<P>&startq;Remember, Signor,&endq; &s;aid Paulo, &startq;what
a chance we have of being &s;tarved, unle&s;s we
venture to di&s;cover our&s;elves to the&s;e people,
or whatever they are.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Venture!&endq; exclaimed Vivaldi. &startq;What
has &s;uch a wretch as I to do with fear?
O, Ellena, Ellena!&endq;</P>
<P>He in&s;tantly called loudly to the per&s;on
whom he believed he had heard, and was
&s;econded by Paulo; but their continued
vociferations availed them nothing; no
an&s;wer was returned; and even the in|di&s;tinct
&s;ounds, which had awakened their
attention, were heard no more.</P>
<P>Exhau&s;ted by their efforts, they laid down
oh the floor of the dungeon, abandoning
all further attempts at e&s;cape till the morn|ing
light might a&s;&s;i&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="208" REF="221">
Vivaldi had no further &s;pirits to enquire
for the remainder of Paulo's narrative. Al|mo&s;t
de&s;pairing for him&s;elf, he could not
feel an intere&s;t concerning &s;trangers; for
he had already perceived, that it could not
afford him information connected with
Ellena; and Paulo, who had roared him|&s;elf
hoar&s;e, was very willing to be &s;ilent.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<Q><L>Who may &s;he be that &s;teals through yonder cloi&s;ter,</L>
<L>And, as the beam of evening tints her veil,</L>
<L>Uncon&s;ciou&s;ly di&s;clo&s;es &s;aintly features,</L>
<L>Inform'd with the high &s;oul of &s;aintly virtue?</L></Q>
<P>DURING &s;everal days after Ellena's
arrival at the mona&s;tery of San Stefano,
&s;he was not permitted to leave the room.
The door was locked upon her, and not
any per&s;on appeared except the nun, who
brought her a &s;canty portion of food, and
who was the &s;ame, that had fir&s;t admitted
her into that part of the convent appro|priated
to the abbe&s;s.</P>
<P>On the fourth day, when, probably, it
was believed that her &s;pirits were &s;ubdued
by confinement, and by her experience of the
&s;uffering &s;he had to expect from re&s;i&s;tance,
&s;he was &s;ummoned to the parlour. The
abbe&s;s was alone, and the air of au&s;terity,
<PB N="210" REF="223">
with which &s;he regarded Ellena, prepared
the latter to endure.</P>
<P>After an exordium on the heinou&s;ne&s;s of
her offence, and the nece&s;&s;ity there was for
taking mea&s;ures to protect the peace and
dignity of a noble family, which her late
conduct had nearly de&s;troyed; the abbe&s;s
informed her, that &s;he mu&s;t determine
either to accept the veil, or the per&s;on whom
the Marche&s;a di Vivaldi had, of her great
goodne&s;s, &s;elected for her hu&s;band.</P>
<P>&startq;You never can be &s;ufficiently grateful,&endq;
added the abbe&s;s, &startq;for the genero&s;ity the
Marche&s;a di&s;plays, in allowing you a choice
on the &s;ubject. After the injury you have
endeavoured to inflict upon her and her
family, you could not expect that any in|dulgence
would be &s;hewn you. It was nar|tural
to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Marche&s;a would
have puni&s;hed you with &s;everity; in&s;tead
of which, &s;he allows you to enter into our
&s;ociety; or, if you have not &s;trength of
mind &s;ufficient to enable you to renounce a
&s;inful world, &s;he permits you to return into
<PB N="211" REF="224">
it, and gives you a &s;uitable partner to &s;up|port
you through its cares and toils,&mdash;a
partner much more &s;uitable to your cir|cum&s;tances
than him, to whom you had
the temerity to lift your eye.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena blu&s;hed at this coar&s;e appeal to
her pride, and per&s;evered in a di&s;dainful
&s;ilence. Thus to give to injustice the co|louring
of mercy, and to acts mo&s;t ab&s;o|lutely
tyrannical the &s;oftening tints of gene|ro&s;ity,
excited her hone&s;t indignation. She
was not, however, &s;hocked by a di&s;covery
of the de&s;igns formed again&s;t her, &s;ince
from the moment of her arrival at San
Stefano, &s;he had expected &s;omething ter|ribly
&s;evere, and had prepared her mind to
meet it with fortitude; for &s;he believed,
that, &s;o &s;upported, &s;he &s;hould weary the
malice of her enemies, and finally triumph
over misfortune. It was only when &s;he
thought of Vivaldi that her courage failed,
and that the injuries &s;he endured &s;eemed
too heavy to be long &s;u&s;tained.</P>
<P><PB N="212" REF="225">
&startq;You are &s;ilent!&endq; &s;aid the abbe&s;s, after
a pau&s;e of expectation. &startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible,
then, that you can be ungrateful for the
genero&s;ity of the Marche&s;a? But, though
you may at pre&s;ent be in&s;en&s;ible to her
goodne&s;s, I will forbear to take advantage
of your indi&s;cretion, and will &s;till allow you
liberty of choice. You may retire to your
chamber, to con&s;ider and to decide. But
remember, that you mu&s;t abide by the de|termination
you &s;hall avow; and, that you
will be allowed no appeal from the alterna|tives,
which are now placed before you.&mdash;If
you reject the veil, you mu&s;t accept the
hu&s;band who is offered you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is unnece&s;&s;ary,&endq; &s;aid Ellena, with an
air of dignified tranquillity, &startq;that I &s;hould
withdraw for the purpo&s;es of con&s;idering
and deciding. My re&s;olution is already
taken, and I reject each of the offered al|ternatives.
I will neither condemn my&s;elf
to a cloi&s;ter, or to the degradation, with
which I am threatened on the other hand.
Having &s;aid this, I am prepared to meet
<PB N="213" REF="226">
whatever &s;uffering you &s;hall inflict upon me;
but be a&s;&s;ured, that my own voice never
&s;hall &s;anction the evils to which I may be
&s;ubjected, and that the immortal love of ju&s;|tice,
which fills all my heart, will &s;u&s;tain my
courage no le&s;s powerfully than the &s;en&s;e of
what is due to my own character. You
are now acquainted with my &s;entiments and
my re&s;olutions; I &s;hall repeat them no
more.&endq;</P>
<P>The abbe&s;s, who&s;e &s;urpri&s;e had thus long
&s;uffered Ellena to &s;peak, &s;till fixed upon her
a &s;tern regard, as &s;he &s;aid, &startq;Where is it that
you have learned the&s;e heroics, and acquired,
the ra&s;hne&s;s which thus prompts you to avow
them!&mdash;the boldne&s;s which enables you to
in&s;ult your Superior, a prie&s;te&s;s of your holy
religion, even in her &s;anctuary!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;anctuary is prophaned,&endq; &s;aid El|lena,
mildly, but with dignity: &startq;it is be|come
a pri&s;on. It is only when the Superior
cea&s;es to re&s;pect the precepts of that holy
religion, the precepts which teach her ju&s;|tice
and benevolence, that &s;he her&s;elf is no
<PB N="214" REF="227">
longer re&s;pected. The very &s;entiment which
bids us revere its mild and beneficent laws,
bids us al&s;o reject die violators of them:
when you command me to reverence my
religion, you urge me to condemn your|&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Withdraw!&endq; &s;aid the abbe&s;s, ri&s;ing
impatiently from her chair; &startq;your ad|monition,
&s;o becomingly delivered, &s;hall
not be forgotten.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena willingly obeyed, and was led back
to her cell, where &s;he &s;at down pen&s;ively, and
reviewed her conduct. Her judgment ap|proved
of the frankne&s;s, with which &s;he had
a&s;&s;erted her rights, and of the firmne&s;s, with
which &s;he had reproved a woman, who had
dared to demand re&s;pect from the very vic|tim
of her cruelty and oppre&s;&s;ion. She was
the more &s;ati&s;fied with her&s;elf, becau&s;e
&s;he had never, for an in&s;tant, forgotten her
own dignity &s;o far, as to degenerate into the
vehemence of pa&s;&s;ion, or to faulter with the
weakne&s;s of fear. Her conviction of the
abbe&s;s's unworthy character, was too clear
<PB N="215" REF="228">
to allow Ellena to feel aba&s;hed in her pre|&s;ence;
for &s;he regarded only the cen&s;ure of
the good, to which &s;he had ever been as
tremblingly alive, as &s;he was obdurately
in&s;en&s;ible to that of the vicious.</P>
<P>Ellena, having now a&s;&s;erted her re&s;olu|tions,
determined to avoid, if po&s;&s;ible, all
repetition of &s;cenes like the la&s;t, and to
repel by &s;ilence only, whatever indignity
might be offered her. She knew that &s;he
mu&s;t &s;uffer, and &s;he re&s;olved to endure.
Of the three evils, which were placed be|fore
her, that of confinement, with all its
melancholy accompaniments, appeared con|&s;iderably
le&s;s &s;evere, than either the threat|ened
marriage, or a formal renunciation of
the world; either of which would devote
her, during life, to mi&s;ery, and that by
her own act. Her choice, therefore, had
been ea&s;y, and the way was plain before
her. If &s;he could endure with calmne&s;s
the hard&s;hips which &s;he could not avoid,
half their weight would be unfelt; and &s;he
now mo&s;t &s;trenuou&s;ly endeavoured to attain
<PB N="216" REF="229">
the &s;trength of mind, which was nece&s;&s;ary
to &s;upport &s;uch equanimity.</P>
<P>For &s;everal days after the late interview
with the, abbe&s;s, &s;he was kept a clo&s;e pri|&s;oner;
but on the fifth evening &s;he was
permitted to attend ve&s;pers. As &s;he walked
through the garden to the chapel, the ordi|nary
fre&s;hne&s;s of the open air and the ver|dure
of the trees and &s;hrubs were luxuries
to her, who had &s;o long been re&s;tricted
from the common ble&s;&s;ings of nature. She
followed the nuns to a chapel where they
u&s;ually performed their devotions, and was
there &s;eated among the novices. The &s;o|lemnity
of the &s;ervice, and particularly of
tho&s;e parts, which were accompanied by
mu&s;ic, touched all her heart, and &s;oothed
and elevated her &s;pirit.</P>
<P>Among the voices of the choir, was one
who&s;e expre&s;&s;ion immediately fixed her at|tention;
it &s;eemed to &s;peak a lo&s;tier &s;enti|ment
of devotion than the others, and to be
modulated by the melancholy of an heart,
<PB N="217" REF="230">
that had long &s;ince taken leave of this world.
Whether it &s;welled with the high peal of the
organ, or mingled in low and trembling ac|cents
with the &s;inking chorus, Ellena felt
that &s;he under&s;tood all the feelings of the
brea&s;t from which it flowed; and &s;he looked
to the gallery where the nuns were a&s;&s;em|bled,
to di&s;cover a countenance, that might
&s;eem to accord with the &s;en&s;ibility expre&s;&s;ed
in the voice. As no &s;trangers were admit|ted
to the chapel, &s;ome of the &s;i&s;ters had
thrown back their veils, and &s;he &s;aw little
that intere&s;ted her in their various faces;
but the figure and attitude of a nun, kneel|ing
in a remote part of the gallery, beneath
a lamp, which threw its rays a&s;lant her head,
perfectly agreed with the idea &s;he had formed
of the &s;inger, and the &s;ound &s;eemed to ap|proach
immediately from that direction.
Her face was concealed by a black veil,
who&s;e tran&s;parency, however, permitted
the fairne&s;s of her complexion to appear;
but the air of her head, and the &s;ingularity
<PB N="218" REF="231">
of her attitude, for &s;he was the only per&s;on
who remained kneeling, &s;ufficiently indi|cated
the &s;uperior degree of fervency and
penitence, which the voice had expre&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>When the hymn had cea&s;ed, &s;he ro&s;e from
her knees, and Ellena, &s;oon after, ob&s;erv|ing
her throw back her veil, di&s;covered, by
the lamp, which &s;hed its full light upon her
features, a countenance, that in&s;tantly con|firmed
her conjecture. It was touched with
a melancholy kind of re&s;ignation; yet grief
&s;eemed &s;till to occa&s;ion the palene&s;s, and
the air of languor, that prevailed over it,
and which di&s;appeared only when the mo|mentary
energy of devotion &s;eemed to lift
her &s;pirit above this world, and to impart
to it &s;omewhat of a &s;eraphic grandeur. At
tho&s;e moments her blue eyes were rai&s;ed
towards Heaven, with &s;uch meek, yet fer|vent
love, &s;uch &s;ublime enthu&s;ia&s;m as the
heads of Guido &s;ometimes di&s;play, and
which renewed, with Ellena, all the en|chanting
<PB N="219" REF="232">
effects of the voice &s;he had ju&s;t
heard.</P>
<P>While &s;he regarded the nun with a de|gree
of intere&s;t which rendered her in&s;en&s;ible
to every other object in the chapel, &s;he
fancied &s;he could perceive the calmne&s;s
in her countenance to be that of de&s;pair,
rather than of re&s;ignation; for, when her
thoughts were not elevated in prayer, there
was frequently a fixedne&s;s in her look, too
energetic for common &s;uffering, or for the
temper of mind, which may lead to perfect
re&s;ignation. It had, however, much that
attached the &s;ympathy of Ellena, and much
that &s;eemed to &s;peak a &s;imilarity of feeling.
Ellena was not only &s;oothed, but in &s;ome
degree comforted, while &s;he gazed upon
her; a &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s which may, perhaps, be
pardoned, when it is con&s;idered, that &s;he
thus knew there was one human being, at
lea&s;t, in the convent, who mu&s;t be capable
of feeling pity, and willing to admini&s;ter
con&s;olation. Ellena endeavoured to meet
<PB N="220" REF="233">
her eye, that &s;he might inform her of the
regard &s;he had in&s;pired, and expre&s;s her
own unhappine&s;s; but the nun was &s;o en|tirely
engaged by devotion, that &s;he did not
&s;ucceed.</P>
<P>As they left the chapel, however, the
nun pa&s;&s;ed clo&s;e by Ellena, who threw
back her veil, and fixed upon her a look
&s;o &s;upplicating and expre&s;&s;ive, that the nun
pau&s;ed, and in her turn regarded the no|vice,
not with &s;urprize only, but with a
mixture of curio&s;ity and compa&s;&s;ion. A
faint blu&s;h cro&s;&s;ed her cheek, her &s;pirits
&s;eemed to faulter, and &s;he was unwilling to
withdraw her eyes from Ellena: but it was
nece&s;&s;ary that &s;he &s;hould continue in the
proce&s;&s;ion, and, bidding her farewel by a
&s;mile of ineffable pity, &s;he pa&s;&s;ed on to the
court, while Ellena followed with attention
&s;till fixed upon the &s;i&s;ter, who &s;oon di&s;|appeared
beyond the doorway of the Ab|be&s;s's
apartment, and Ellena had nearly
reached her own, before her thoughts were
<PB N="221" REF="234">
&s;ufficiently di&s;engaged to permit her to en|quire
the name of the &s;tranger.</P>
<P>&startq;It is &s;i&s;ter Olivia whom you mean,
perhaps,&endq; &s;aid her conductre&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;She is very hand&s;ome,&endq; &s;aid Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;Many of the &s;i&s;ters are &s;o,&endq; replied
Margaritone, with an air of pique.</P>
<P>&startq;Undoubtedly,&endq; &s;aid Ellena; &startq;but &s;he,
whom I mean, has a mo&s;t touching counte|nance;
frank, noble, full of &s;en&s;ibility;
and there is a gentle melancholy in her
eye, which cannot but intere&s;t all who
ob&s;erve her.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena was &s;o fa&s;cinated by this intere&s;t|ing
nun, that &s;he forgot &s;he was describing
her to a per&s;on, who&s;e callous heart rendered
her in&s;en&s;ible to the influence of any coun|tenance,
except, perhaps, the commanding
one of the lady abbe&s;s; and to whom,
therefore, a de&s;cription of the fine traits,
which Ellena felt, was as unintelligible as
would have been an Arabic in&s;cription.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="235">
&startq;She is pa&s;&s;ed the bloom of youth,&endq;
continued Ellena, &s;till anxious to be under|&s;tood;
&startq;but &s;he retains all its intere&s;ting
graces, and adds to them the dignity of&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;If you mean that &s;he is of middle age,&endq;
interrupted Margaritone, peevi&s;hly, &startq;it is
&s;i&s;ter Olivia you mention, for we are all
younger than &s;he is.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena, rai&s;ing her eyes almo&s;t uncon|&s;ciou&s;ly,
as the nun &s;poke this, fixed them
upon a face fallow, meagre, &s;eemingly near
fifty years an inhabitant of this world; and
&s;he could &s;carcely &s;uppre&s;s the &s;urprize &s;he
felt, on perceiving &s;uch wretched vanity
lingering among the chilled pa&s;&s;ions of &s;o
repul&s;ive a frame, and within the &s;eque&s;|tered
&s;hade of a cloi&s;ter. Margaritone,
&s;till jealous of the prai&s;e be&s;towed on Olivia,
repelled all further enquiry, and, having at|tended
Ellena to her cell, locked her up for
the night.</P>
<P><PB N="223" REF="236">
On the following evening Ellena was
again permitted to attend ve&s;pers, and, on
the way to the chapel, the hope of &s;eeing
her intere&s;ting favourite reanimated her
&s;pirits. In the &s;ame part of the gallery, as
on the preceding night, &s;he again appeared,
and kneeling, as before, beneath the lamp,
in private ori&s;on, for the &s;ervice was not
begun.</P>
<P>Ellena endeavoured to &s;ubdue the im|patience
&s;he felt to expre&s;s her regard, and
to be noticed by the holy &s;i&s;ter, till &s;he
&s;hould have fini&s;hed. When the nun ro&s;e,
and ob&s;erved Ellena, &s;he lifted her veil,
and, fixing on her the &s;ame enquiring eye,
her countenance brightened into a &s;mile &s;o
full of compa&s;&s;ion and intelligence, that
Ellena, forgetting the decorums of the
place, left her &s;eat to approach her; it
&s;eemed as if the &s;oul, which beamed forth
in that &s;mile, had long been acquainted
with hers. As she advanced, the nun drop|ped
her veil, a reproof which me immedi|ately
<PB N="224" REF="237">
under&s;tood, and &s;he withdrew to her
&s;eat; but her attention remained fixed on
the nun during the whole &s;ervice.</P>
<P>At the conclu&s;ion, when they left the
chapel, and &s;he &s;aw Olivia pa&s;s without no|ticing
her, Ellena could &s;carcely re&s;train
her tears; &s;he returned in deep dejection
to her room. The regard of this nun was
not only delightful, but &s;eemed nece&s;&s;ary
to her heart, and &s;he dwelt, with fond per|&s;everance,
on the &s;mile that had expre&s;&s;ed
&s;o much, and which threw one gleam of
comfort, even through the bars of her
pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Her reverie was &s;oon interrupted by a
light &s;tep, that approached her cell, and in
the next moment the door was unlocked,
and Olivia her&s;elf appeared. Ellena ro&s;e
with emotion to meet her; the nun held
forth her hand to receive hers,</P>
<P>&startq;You are unu&s;ed to confinement,&endq; &s;aid
&s;he, curt&s;ying mournfully, and placing on
<PB N="225" REF="238">
the table a little ba&s;ket containing refre&s;h|ment,
&startq;and our hard fare&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;I under&s;tand you,&endq; &s;aid Ellena, with
a look expre&s;&s;ive of her gratitude; &startq;you
have a heart that can pity, though you in|habit
the&s;e walls;&mdash;you have &s;uffered too,
and know the delicate genero&s;ity of &s;often|ing
the &s;orrows of others, by any attention
that may tell them your &s;ympathy. O! if
I could expre&s;s how much the &s;en&s;e of this
affects me!&endq;</P>
<P>Tears interrupted her. Olivia pre&s;&s;ed
her hand, looked &s;teadily upon her face,
and was &s;omewhat agitated, but &s;he &s;oon
recovered apparent tranquillity, and &s;aid,
with a &s;erious: &s;mile, &startq;You judge, rightly,
my &s;i&s;ter, re&s;pecting my &s;entiments, how|ever
you may do. concerning, my &s;ufferings.
My heart is not in&s;en&s;ible to pity, nor to

happier days than you can hope to find
within the&s;e cloi&s;ters!&startq;</P>
<P><PB N="226" REF="239">
She checked her&s;elf as if &s;he had allowed
too much, and then added, &startq;But you may,
perhaps, be peaceful; and &s;ince it con&s;oles
you to know that you have a friend near
you, believe me that friend&mdash;but believe it
in &s;ilence. I will vi&s;it you when I am per|mitted&mdash;but
do not enquire for me; and
if my vi&s;its are &s;hort, do not pre&s;s me to
lengthen them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How good this is!&endq; &s;aid Ellena, in a
faultering voice. &startq;How &s;weet too it is!
you will vi&s;it me, and I am pitied by
you!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hu&s;h!&endq; &s;aid the nun, expre&s;&s;ively;
&startq;no more; I may be ob&s;erved. Good
night, my &s;i&s;ter; may your &s;lumbers be
light!&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena's heart &s;unk. She had not &s;pi|rits
to &s;ay, &startq;Good night!&endq; but her eyes,
covered with tears, &s;aid more. The nun
turned her own away &s;uddenly, and, pre&s;&s;ing
her hand in &s;ilence, left the cell. Ellena,
<PB N="227" REF="240">
firm and tranquil under the in&s;ults of the
abbe&s;s, was now melted into tears by the
kindne&s;s of a friend. The&s;e gentle tears
were refre&s;hing to her long-oppre&s;&s;ed &s;pi|rits,
and &s;he indulged them. Of Vivaldi
&s;he thought with more compo&s;ure than &s;he
had done &s;ince &s;he left the villa Altieri;
and &s;omething like hope began to revive
in her heart, though reflection offered no|thing
to &s;upport it.</P>
<P>On the following morning, &s;he perceived
that the door of her cell had not been
clo&s;ed. She ro&s;e impatiently, and, not
without a hope of liberty, immediately
pa&s;&s;ed it. The cell, opening, upon a &s;hort
pa&s;&s;age, which communicated with the main
building, and which was &s;hut up by a door,
was &s;ecluded, and almo&s;t in&s;ulated from
every other chamber; and this door being
now &s;ecured, Ellena was as truly a pri&s;oner
as before. It appeared then, that the nun
had omitted to fa&s;ten the cell only for the
purpo&s;e of allowing her more &s;pace to walk
<PB N="228" REF="241">
in the pa&s;&s;age, and &s;he was grateful for the
attention. Still more &s;he was &s;o, when,
having traver&s;ed it, &s;he perceived one ex|tremity
terminate in a narrow &s;tair-ca&s;e,
that appeared to lead to other chambers.</P>
<P>She a&s;cended the winding &s;teps ha&s;tily,
and found they led only to a door, open|ing
into a &s;mall room, where nothing
remarkable appeared, till &s;he approached
the windows, and beheld thence an hori|zon,
and a land&s;cape &s;pread below, who&s;e
grandeur awakened all her heart. The
con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of her pri&s;on was lo&s;t, while
her eyes ranged over the wide and freely|&s;ublime
&s;cene without. She perceived that
this chamber was within a &s;mall turret, pro|jecting
from an angle of the convent over
the walls, and &s;u&s;pended, as in air, above
the va&s;t precipices of granite, that formed
part of the mountain. The&s;e precipices
were broken into cliffs, which, in &s;ome
places, impended far above their ba&s;e, and,
in others, ro&s;e, in nearly-perpendicular
<PB N="229" REF="242">
lines, to the walls of the mona&s;tery, which
they &s;upported. Ellena, with a dreadful
plea&s;ure, looked down them, &s;hagged as they
were with larch, and frequently darkened
by lines of gigantic pine bending along the
rocky ledges, till her eye re&s;ted on the thick
che&s;nut woods that extended over their
winding ba&s;e, and which, &s;oftening to the
plains, &s;eemed to form a gradation between
the variegated cultivation there, and the
awful wildne&s;s of the rocks above. Round
the&s;e exten&s;ive plains were tumbled the
mountains, of various &s;hape and attitude,
which Ellena had admired on her approach
to San Stefano; &s;ome &s;haded with fore&s;ts
of olive and almond trees, but the greater
part abandoned to the flocks, which, in
&s;ummer, feed on their aromatic herbage,
and on the approach of winter, de&s;cend to
the &s;heltered plains of the <HI>Tavogliere di
Puglia.</HI></P>
<P>On the left opened the dreadful, pa&s;s
which &s;he had traver&s;ed, and the thunder
<PB N="230" REF="243">
of who&s;e waters now murmured, at a dis|tance.
The accumulation of overtopping
points, which the mountains of this dark
per&s;pective exhibited, pre&s;ented an image of
grandeur &s;uperior to any thing &s;he had
&s;een while within the pa&s;s itself.</P>
<P>To Ellena, who&s;e mind was capable of be|ing
highly elevated, or &s;weetly &s;oothed, by
&s;cenes of nature, the di&s;covery of this little
turret was an important circum&s;tance. Hi|ther
&s;he could come, and her &s;oul, refre&s;hed
by the views it afforded, would acquire
&s;trength to bear her, with equanimity,
thro' the per&s;ecutions that might await her.
Here, gazing upon the &s;tupendous imagery
around her, looking, as it were, beyond the
awful veil which ob&s;cures the features, of the
Deity, and conceals Him from the eyes of
his creatures, dwelling as with a pre&s;ent
God in the mid&s;t of his &s;ublime works;
with a mind thus elevated, how in&s;ignifi|cant
would appear to her the tran&s;actions,
and the &s;ufferings of this world! How
<PB N="231" REF="244">
poor the boa&s;ted power of man, when the
fall of a &s;ingle cliff from the&s;e mountains
would with ea&s;e de&s;troy thou&s;ands of his
race a&s;&s;embled on the plains below! How
would it avail them, that they were ac|coutred
for battle, armed with all the in|&s;truments
of de&s;truction that human inven|tion
ever fa&s;hioned? Thus man, the giant
who now held her in captivity, would &s;hrink
to the diminutivene&s;s of a fairy; and &s;he
would experience, that his utmo&s;t force was
unable to enchain her &s;oul, or compel her
to fear him, while he was de&s;titute of
virtue.</P>
<P>Ellena's attention was recalled from the
&s;eene without by a &s;ound from within the
gallery, and &s;he then heard a key turning
in the door of the pa&s;&s;age. Fearing that it
was &s;i&s;ter Margaritone who approached,
and who, informed by her ab&s;ence of the
con&s;olatory turret &s;he had di&s;covered, would
perhaps debar her from ever returning, to
it, Ellena de&s;cended with a palpitating heart,
<PB N="232" REF="245">
and found that nun in the cell. Surprize
and &s;everity were in her countenance, when
&s;he enquired by what means Ellena had
unclo&s;ed the door, and whither &s;he had
been.</P>
<P>Ellena an&s;wered without any prevarica|tion,
that &s;he had found the door un|fa&s;tened,
and that &s;he had vi&s;ited the turret
above; but &s;he forbore to expre&s;s a wi&s;h
to return thither, judging that &s;uch an ex|pre&s;&s;ion
would certainly exclude her in fu|ture.
Margaritone, after &s;harply rebuking
her for prying beyond the pa&s;&s;age, and, &s;et|ting
down the breakfa&s;t &s;he had brought,
left the room, the door of which &s;he did
not forget to &s;ecure. Thus Ellena was at
once deprived of &s;o innocent a means of
con&s;olation as her plea&s;ant turret had af|forded.</P>
<P>During &s;everal days, &s;he &s;aw only the
au&s;tere nun, except when &s;he attended ve&s;|pers;
where, however, &s;he was &s;o vigilantly
ob&s;erved, that &s;he feared to &s;peak with
<PB N="233" REF="246">
Olivia, even by her eyes. Olivia's were
often fixed upon her face, and with a kind
of expre&s;&s;ion Which Ellena, when she did ven|ture
to look at her, could not perfectly in|terpret.
It was not only of pity, but of anxi|ous
curio&s;ity, and of &s;omething al&s;o like
fear. A blu&s;h would &s;ometimes wander
over her cheek, which was &s;ucceeded by an
extreme palene&s;s, and by an air of &s;uch
univer&s;al languor as precedes a fainting fit:
but the exerci&s;es of devotion &s;eemed fre|quently
to recal her fleeting &s;pirits, and to
elevate them with hope and courage.</P>
<P>When &s;he left the chapel, Ellena &s;aw
Olivia no more that night; but on the fol|lowing
morning &s;he came with breakfa&s;t to
the cell. A character of peculiar &s;adne&s;s
was on her brow.</P>
<P>&startq;O! how glad I am to &s;ee you!&endq; &s;aid
Ellena; &startq;and how much I have regretted
your long ab&s;ence! I was obliged to re|member
con&s;tantly what you had enjoined,
to forbear enquiring after you.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="234" REF="247">
The nun replied with a melancholy &s;mile,
&startq;I come in obedience to our lady abbe&s;s,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he, as &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf on Ellena's
mattre&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;And did you not wi&s;h to come?&endq; &s;aid
Ellena, mournfully.</P>
<P>&startq;I did wi&s;h it,&endq; replied Olivia; &startq;but&endq;
and &s;he he&s;itated.</P>
<P>&startq;Whence then this reluctance?&endq; en|quired
Ellena.</P>
<P>Olivia was &s;ilent a moment.</P>
<P>&startq;You are a me&s;&s;enger of evil news$&endq;
&s;aid Ellena; &startq;you are only reluctant to
afflict me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is as you &s;ay,&endq; replied Olivia; &startq;I am
only reluctant to afflict you; and I fear
you have too many attachments to the world,
to allow you to receive, without &s;orrow,
what I have to communicate. I am ordered
to prepare you for the vows, and to &s;ay, that,
&s;ince you have rejected the hu&s;band which
was propo&s;ed to you, you are to accept the
veil; that many of the cu&s;tomary forms
<PB N="235" REF="248">
are to be di&s;pen&s;ed with; and that the cere|mony
of taking the black veil, will follow
without delay that of receiving the white one.&endq;</P>
<P>The nun pau&s;ed; and Ellena &s;aid,
&startq;You are an Unwilling bearer of this cruel
me&s;&s;age; and I reply only to the lady ab|be&s;s,
when I declare, that I never will ac|cept
either; that force may &s;end me to the
altar, but that it never &s;hall compel me to
utter vows which my heart abhors; and if
I am con&s;trained to appear there, it &s;hall be
only to prote&s;t again&s;t her tyranny, and
again&s;t the form intended to &s;anction it.&endq;</P>
<P>To Olivia this an&s;wer was &s;o far from
being di&s;plea&s;ing, that it appeared to give
her &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>&startq;I dare not applaud your re&s;olution,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he; &startq;but I will not condemn, it.
You have, no doubt, connections in the
world which would render a &s;eclu&s;ion from
it afflicting. You have relations, friends,
from whom it would be dreadful to part?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have neither,&endq; &s;aid Ellena, &s;ighing.</P>
<P><PB N="236" REF="249">
&startq;No! Can that be po&s;&s;ible? and yet
you are &s;o unwilling to retire!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have only one friend,&endq; replied Ellena,
&startq;and it is of him they would deprive me!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pardon, my love, the abruptne&s;s of the&s;e
enquiries,&endq; &s;aid Olivia; &startq;yet, while I en|treat
your forgivene&s;s, I am inclined to of|fend
again, and to a&s;k your name.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is a que&s;tion I will readily an&s;wer.
My name is Ellena di Ro&s;alba.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How?&endq; &s;aid Olivia, with an air of
deliberation; &startq;Ellena di&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Di Ro&s;alba,&endq; repeated her companion;
&startq;and permit me to a&s;k your motive for the
enquiry: do you know any per&s;on of my
name?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; replied the nun, mournfully;
&startq;but your features have &s;ome re&s;emblance
to tho&s;e of a friend I once had.&endq;</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;aid this, her agitation was apparent,
and &s;he ro&s;e to go. &startq;I mu&s;t not lengthen
my vi&s;it, le&s;t I &s;hould be forbidden to repeat
it,&endq; &s;aid &s;he. &startq;What an&s;wer &s;hall I give to
<PB N="237" REF="250">
the abbe&s;s? If you are determined to reject
the veil, allow me to advi&s;e you to &s;often
your refu&s;al as much as po&s;&s;ible. I am,
perhaps, better acquainted with her cha|racter
than you are; and O, my &s;i&s;ter!
I would not &s;ee; you pining away your ex|i&s;tence
in this &s;olitary cell.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How much I am obliged by the inter|e&s;t
you expre&s;s for my welfare,&endq; &s;aid Ellena,
&startq;and by the advice you offer! I will yield
my judgment in this in&s;tance to yours; you
&s;hall modulate my refu&s;al as you think pro|per:
but remember that it mu&s;t be ab&s;olute;
and beware, left the abbe&s;s &s;hould mi&s;take
gentlene&s;s for irre&s;olution.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Tru&s;t me, I will be cautious in all that
relates to you,&endq; &s;aid Olivia. &startq;Farewell!
I will vi&s;it you, if po&s;&s;ible, in the evening.
In the mean time the door &s;hall be left open,
that you may have more air and pro&s;pect
than this cell affords. That &s;tairca&s;e leads
to a plea&s;ant chamber.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="238" REF="251">
&startq;I have vi&s;ited it already,&endq; replied El|lena,
&startq;and have to thank you for the
goodne&s;s, which permitted me to do &s;o.
To go thither will greatly &s;oothe my &s;pirits;
if I had &s;ome book, and my drawing-in&s;tru|ments,
I could almo&s;t forget my &s;orrows
there.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Could you &s;o?&endq; &s;aid the nun, with an
affectionate &s;mile. &startq;Adieu! I will endea|vour
to &s;ee you in the evening. If &s;i&s;ter
Margaritone returns, be careful not to en|quire
for me; nor once a&s;k her for the little
indulgence I give you.&endq;</P>
<P>Olivia withdrew, and Ellena retired to the
chamber above, where &s;he lo&s;t for a while
all &s;en&s;e of &s;orrow amid&s;t the great
&s;cenery,
which its windows exhibited.</P>
<P>At noon, the &s;tep of Margaritone &s;um|moned
Ellena from her retreat, and &s;he
was &s;urpri&s;ed that no reproof followed this
&s;econd di&s;covery of her ab&s;ence. Marga|ritone
only &s;aid, that the abbe&s;s had the
goodne&s;s to permit Ellena to dine with the
<PB N="239" REF="252">
novices, and that &s;he came to conduct her
to their table.</P>
<P>Ellena did not rejoice in this permi&s;&s;ion,
preferring to remain in her &s;olitary turret,
to the being expo&s;ed to the examining eyes
of &s;trangers; and &s;he followed dejectedly,
through the &s;ilent pa&s;&s;ages to the apartment
where they were a&s;&s;embled. She was not
le&s;s &s;urpri&s;ed than embarra&s;&s;ed to
ob&s;erve,
in the manners of young people re&s;iding
in a convent, an ab&s;ence of that deco|rum,
which includes beneath its mode&s;t
&s;hade every grace that ought to adorn the
female character, like the veil which gives
dignity to their air and &s;oftne&s;s to their fea|tures.
When Ellena entered the room,
the eyes of the whole company were imme|diately
fixed upon her; the young ladies
began to whi&s;per and &s;mile, and &s;hewed,
by various means, that &s;he was the &s;ubject
of conver&s;ation, not otherwi&s;e than cen|&s;orious.
No one advanced to meet and to
encourage her, to welcome her to the table,
<PB N="240" REF="253">
or &s;till le&s;s di&s;play one of tho&s;e namele&s;s
graces, with which a generous and delicate
mind delights to reanimate the mode&s;t and
the unfortunate.</P>
<P>Ellena took a chair In &s;ilence; and,
though &s;he had at fir&s;t felt forlorn and em|barra&s;&s;ed
by the impertinent manners of her
companions, a con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of innocence
gradually revived her &s;pirits, and enabled
her to re&s;ume an air of dignity, which re|pre&s;&s;ed
this rude pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>Ellena returned to her cell, for the fir&s;t
time, with eagerne&s;s. Margaritone did not
fa&s;ten the door of it, but &s;he was careful to
&s;ecure that of the pa&s;&s;age; and even this
&s;mall indulgence &s;he &s;eemed to allow with a
&s;urly reluctance, as if compelled to obey
the command of a &s;uperior. The moment
&s;he was gone, Ellena withdrew to her plea|&s;ant
turret, where, after having &s;uffered
from the coar&s;e manners of the novices, her
gratitude was the more lively, when &s;he
perceived the delicate attention of her be|loved
<PB N="241" REF="254">
nun. It appeared that &s;he had vi&s;it|ed
the chamber in Ellena's ab&s;ence, and
had cau&s;ed to be brought thither a chair
and a table, on which were placed &s;ome
books, and a knot of fragrant flowers.
Ellena did not repre&s;s the grateful tears,
which the generous feelings of Olivia
excited; and &s;he forbore, for &s;ome mo|ments,
to examine the books, that the plea|&s;ing
emotions &s;he experienced might not be
interrupted.</P>
<P>On looking into the&s;e books, however,
&s;he perceived, that &s;ome of them treated of
my&s;tical &s;ubjects, which &s;he laid a&s;ide with
di&s;appointment; but in others &s;he ob&s;erved
a few of the be&s;t Italian poets, and a volume
or two of Guicciardini's hi&s;tory. She was
&s;omewhat &s;urpri&s;ed, that the poets &s;hould
have found their way to the library of a nun,
but was too much plea&s;ed with the di&s;co|very
to dwell on the enquiry.</P>
<P>Having arranged her books, and &s;et her
little room in order, &s;he &s;eated her&s;elf at a
<PB N="242" REF="255">
window, and, with a volume of Ta&s;&s;o, en|deavoured
to bani&s;h every painful remem|brance
from her mind. She continued
wandering in the imaginary &s;cenes of the
poet, till the fading light recalled her to
tho&s;e of reality. The &s;un was &s;et, but the
mountain-tops were &s;till lighted up by his
beams, and a tint of glorious purple co|loured
all the we&s;t, and began to change
the &s;nowy points on the horizon. The
&s;ilence and repo&s;e of the va&s;t &s;cene, pro|moted
the tender melancholy that prevailed
in her heart; &s;he thought of Vivaldi, and
wept&mdash;of Vivaldi, whom &s;he might, per|haps,
never &s;ee again, though &s;he doubted
not that he would be indefatigable in &s;earch|ing
for her. Every particular of their la&s;t
conver&s;ation, when he had &s;o earne&s;tly la|mented
the approaching &s;eparation, even
while he allowed of its propriety, came to
her mind; and, while &s;he witne&s;&s;ed, in
imagination, the grief and di&s;traction, which
her my&s;terious departure and ab&s;ence mu&s;t
<PB N="243" REF="256">
have occa&s;ioned him, the fortitude, with
which &s;he had re&s;i&s;ted her own &s;ufferings,
yielded to the picture of his.</P>
<P>The ve&s;per-bell, at length, &s;ummoned her
to prepare for ma&s;s, and &s;he de&s;cended to
her cell to await the arrival of her con|ductre&s;s.
It was Margaritone, who &s;oon
appeared; but in the chapel &s;he, as u&s;ual,
&s;aw Olivia, who, when the &s;ervice had con|cluded,
invited her into the garden of the
convent. There, as &s;he walked beneath the
melancholy cypre&s;&s;es, that, ranged on either
&s;ide the long walks, formed a maje&s;tic ca|nopy,
almo&s;t excluding the evening twi|light,
Olivia conver&s;ed with her on &s;erious,
but general, topics, carefully avoiding any
mention of the abbe&s;s, and of the affairs of
Ellena. The latter, anxious to learn the
effect of her repeated rejection of the veil,
ventured to make &s;ome enquiries, which
the nun immediately di&s;couraged, and as
cautiou&s;ly checked the grateful effu&s;ions of
her young friend for the attentions &s;he had
received.</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="257">
Olivia accompanied Ellena to her cell,
and there no longer &s;crupled to relieve her
from uncertainty. With a mixture of
frankne&s;s and di&s;cretion, &s;he related as
much of the conver&s;ation, that had pa&s;&s;ed
between her&s;elf and the abbe&s;s, as it ap|peared
nece&s;&s;ary for Ellena to know, from
which it &s;eemed that the former was as ob|&s;tinate,
as the latter was firm.</P>
<P>&startq;Whatever may be your re&s;olution,&endq;
added the nun, &startq;I earne&s;tly advi&s;e you,
my &s;i&s;ter, to allow the Superior &s;ome hope
of compliance, le&s;t &s;he proceed to extre|mities.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what extremity can be more ter|rible,&endq;
replied Ellena, &startq;than either of
tho&s;e, to which &s;he would now urge me?
Why &s;hould I de&s;cend to practice di&s;&s;imu|lation?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To &s;ave your&s;elf from unde&s;erved &s;uf|ferings,&endq;
&s;aid Olivia mournfully.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, but I &s;hould then incur de&s;erved
ones,&endq; ob&s;erved Ellena; &startq;and forfeit &s;uch
<PB N="245" REF="258">
peace of mind as my oppre&s;&s;ors never could
re&s;tore to me.&endq; As &s;he &s;aid this, &s;he look|ed
at the nun with an expre&s;&s;ion of gentle
reproach and di&s;appointment.</P>
<P>&startq;I applaud the ju&s;tne&s;s of your &s;enti|ment,&endq;
replied Olivia, regarding her with
tendere&s;t compa&s;&s;ion. &startq;Alas! that a mind
&s;o noble &s;hould be &s;ubjected to the power
of inju&s;tice and depravity!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not &s;ubjected,&endq; &s;aid Ellena, &startq;do not
&s;ay &s;ubjected. I have accu&s;tomed my&s;elf to
contemplate tho&s;e &s;ufferings; I have cho&s;en
the lea&s;t of &s;uch as were given to my choice,
and I will endure them with fortitude; and
can you then &s;ay that I am &s;ubjected?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas, my &s;i&s;ter! you know not what you
promi&s;e,&endq; replied Olivia; &startq;you do not
comprehend the &s;ufferings which may be
preparing for you.&endq;</P>
<P>As &s;he &s;poke, her eyes filled with tears,
and &s;he withdrew them from Ellena, who,
&s;urpri&s;ed at the extreme concern on her
countenance, entreated &s;he would explain
her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="246" REF="259">
&startq;I am not certain, my&s;elf, as to this
point,&endq; &s;aid Olivia; &startq;and if I were,
I &s;hould not dare to explain it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not dare!&endq; repeated Ellena, mourn|fully.
&startq;Can benevolence like yours know
fear, when courage is nece&s;&s;ary to prevent
evil?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Enquire no further!&endq; &s;aid Olivia; but
no blu&s;h of con&s;cious duplicity &s;tained her
cheek. &startq;It is &s;ufficient that you under&s;tand
the con&s;equence of open re&s;i&s;tance to be
terrible, and that you con&s;ent to avoid it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But how avoid it, my beloved friend,
without incurring a con&s;equence which, in
my apprehen&s;ion, would be yet more dread|ful?
How avoid it, without either &s;ubject|ing
my&s;elf to a hateful marriage, or accept|ing
the vows? Either of the&s;e events would
be more terrible to me, than any thing with
which I may be menaced.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Perhaps not,&endq; &s;aid the nun. &startq;Ima|gination
cannot draw the horrors of&mdash;But,
my &s;i&s;ter, let me repeat, that I would
<PB N="247" REF="260">
&s;ave you! O, how willingly &s;ave you from
the evils preparing! and that the only chance
of doing &s;o is, by prevailing with you to aban|don
at lea&s;t the appearance of re&s;i&s;tance.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your kindne&s;s deeply affects me,&endq; &s;aid
Ellena; &startq;and I am fearful of appearing in|&s;en&s;ible
of it, when I reject your advice; yet
I cannot adopt it. The very di&s;&s;imulation,
which I &s;hould employ in &s;elf-defence, might
be a means of involving me in de&s;truction.&endq;</P>
<P>As Ellena concluded, and her eyes glanced
upon the nun, unaccountable &s;u&s;picion oc|curred
to her, that Olivia might be in|&s;incere,
and that, at this very moment,
when &s;he was advi&s;ing di&s;&s;imulation, &s;he
was endeavouring to draw Ellena into &s;ome
&s;nare, which the abbe&s;s had laid. She &s;ick|ened
at this dreadful &s;uppo&s;ition, and di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed
it without &s;uffering her&s;elf to exa|mine
its probability. That Olivia, from
whom &s;he had received &s;o many attentions,
who&s;e countenance and manners announced
&s;o fair a mind, and for whom &s;he had con|ceived
<PB N="248" REF="261">
&s;o much e&s;teem and affection, &s;hould
be cruel and treacherous, was a &s;u&s;picion
that gave her more pain, than the actual
impri&s;onment in which &s;he &s;uffered; and
when &s;he looked again upon her face, El|lena
was con&s;oled by a clear conviction,
that &s;he was utterly incapable of perfidy.</P>
<P>&startq;If it were po&s;&s;ible that I could con&s;ent
to practi&s;e deceit,&endq; re&s;umed Ellena, after a
long pau&s;e, &startq;what could it avail me? I am
entirely in the power of the abbe&s;s, who
would &s;oon put my &s;incerity to the proof;
when a di&s;covery of my duplicity would
only provoke her vengeance, and I &s;hould
be puni&s;hed even for having &s;ought to
avoid inju&s;tice.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If deceit is at any time excu&s;able,&endq; re|plied
Olivia, reluctantly, &startq;it is when we
practi&s;e it in &s;elf-defence. There are &s;ome
rare &s;ituations, when it may be re&s;orted to
without our incurring ignominy, and yours
is one of tho&s;e. But I will acknowledge,
that all the good I expect is from the delay
<PB N="249" REF="262">
which temporizing may procure you. The
Superior, when &s;he under&s;tands there is a
probability of obtaining your confent to her
wi&s;hes, may be willing to allow you the
u&s;ual time of preparation for the veil, and
meanwhile &s;omething may occur to re&s;cue
you from your pre&s;ent &s;ituation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! could I but believe &s;o!&endq; &s;aid
Ellena; &startq;but, alas! what power can re&s;|cue
me? And I have not one relative
remaining even to attempt my deliverance.
To what po&s;&s;ibility do you allude?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The Marche&s;a may relent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Does, then, your po&s;&s;ibility of good re&s;t
with her, my dear friend? If &s;o, I am in
de&s;pair again; for &s;uch a chance of benefit,
there would certainly be little policy in for|feiting
one's integrity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There are al&s;o other po&s;&s;ibilities, my
&s;i&s;ter,&endq; &s;aid Olivia; &startq;but hark! what bell
is that? It is the chime which a&s;&s;embles
the nuns in the apartment of the abbe&s;s,
where &s;he di&s;pen&s;es her evening benedic|tion.
<PB N="250" REF="263">
My ab&s;ence will be ob&s;erved. Good
night, my &s;i&s;ter. Reflect on what I have
advi&s;ed; and remember, I conjure you, to
con&s;ider, that the con&s;equence of your de|ci&s;ion
mu&s;t be &s;olemn, and may be fatal.&endq;</P>
<P>The nun &s;poke this with a look and em|pha&s;is
&s;o extraordinary, that Ellena at once
wi&s;hed and dreaded to know more; but be|fore
&s;he had recovered from her &s;urprize,
Olivia had left the room.</P>

<BIBL>MYSTERIOUS MOTHER.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE adventurous Vivaldi, and his &s;ervant
Paulo, after pa&s;&s;ing the night of Ellena's de|parture
from villa Altieri in one of the &s;ub|terraneous
chambers of the fort of Paluzzi,
and yielding, at length, to exhau&s;ted nature,
awoke in terror and utter darkne&s;s, for the
flambeau had expired. When a recollec|tion
of the occurrences of the preceding
evening returned, they renewed their efforts
for liberty with ardour. The grated win|dow
was again examined, and being found
to overlook only a confined court of the
fortre&s;s, no hope appeared of e&s;caping.</P>
<P>The words of the monk returned with
Vivaldi's fir&s;t recollections, to torture him
<PB N="252" REF="265">
with apprehen&s;ion, that Ellena was no
more; and Paulo, unable either to con&s;ole
or to appea&s;e his ma&s;ter, &s;at down deject|edly
be&s;ide him. Paulo had no longer a
hope to &s;ugge&s;t, or a joke to throw away;
and he could not forbear &s;eriou&s;ly remark|ing,
that to die of hunger was one of the
mo&s;t horrible means of death, or lamenting
the ra&s;hne&s;s which had made them liable to
&s;o &s;ad a probability.</P>
<P>He was in the mid&s;t of a very pathetic
oration, of which, however, his ma&s;ter did
not hear a &s;ingle word, &s;o wholly was his
attention engaged by his own melancholy
thoughts, when on a &s;udden he became
&s;ilent, and then, &s;tarting to his feet, ex|claimed,
&startq;Signor, what is yonder? Do you
&s;ee nothing?&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi looked round.</P>
<P>&startq;It is certainly a ray of light,&endq; con|tinued
Paulo; &startq;and I will &s;oon know
where it comes from.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="253" REF="266">
As he &s;aid this he &s;prung forward, and
his &s;urprize almo&s;t equalled his, joy, when he
di&s;covered that the light i&s;&s;ued through the
door of the vault, which &s;tood a little open.
He could &s;carcely believe, his &s;en&s;es, &s;ince
the door had been &s;trongly fa&s;tened on the
preceding night, and he had not heard its
ponderous bolts undrawn. He threw it
widely open, but recollecting him&s;elf, &s;lop|ped
to look into the adjoining vault before
he ventured forth; when Vivaldi darted
pa&s;t him, and bidding him follow in&s;tant|ly,
a&s;cended to the day. The courts of
the fortre&s;s were &s;ilent and vacant, and
Vivaldi reached the arch-way without hav|ing
ob&s;erved a &s;ingle per&s;on, breathle&s;s with
&s;peed, and &s;carcely daring to believe that
he had regained his liberty.</P>
<P>Beneath the arch He &s;topped to recover
breath, and to confider whether he &s;hould
take the road to Naples, or to the villa Alti|eri,
for it was yet early morning, and at an
hour when it appeared improbable that
<PB N="254" REF="267">
Ellena's family would be ri&s;en. The ap|prehen&s;ion
of her death had vani&s;hed as
Vivaldi's &s;pirits revived, which the pau&s;e of
he&s;itation &s;ufficiently announced: but even
this was the pau&s;e only of an in&s;tant; a
&s;trong anxiety concerning her determined
him to proceed to the villa Altieri, notwith|&s;tanding
the un&s;uitablene&s;s of the hour,
&s;ince he could, at lea&s;t, reconnoitre her re&s;i|dence,
and await till &s;ome &s;ign of the family
having ri&s;en &s;hould appear.</P>
<P>&startq;Pray, Signor,&endq; &s;aid Paulo, while his
ma&s;ter was deliberating, &startq;do not let us
&s;top here le&s;t the enemy &s;hould appear
again; and do, Signor, take the road which
is neare&s;t to &s;ome hou&s;e where we may get
breakfa&s;t, for the fear of &s;tarving has taken
&s;uch hold upon me, that it has nearly anti|cipated
the reality of it already.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi immediately departed for the
villa. Paulo, as he danced joyfully along,
expre&s;&s;ed all the a&s;toni&s;hment that filled
his mind, as to the cau&s;e of their late im|pri&s;onment
<PB N="255" REF="268">
and e&s;cape; but Vivaldi, who
had now leizure to con&s;ider the &s;ubject,
could not a&s;&s;i&s;t him in explaining it. The
only certainty that appeared, was, that he
had not been confined by robbers; and
what intere&s;t any per&s;on could have in im|pri&s;oning
him for the night, and &s;uffering
him to e&s;cape in the morning, did not ap|pear.</P>
<P>On entering the garden at Altieri, he
was &s;urprized to ob&s;erve that &s;everal of the
lower lattices were open at this early hour,
but &s;urprize changed to terror, when, on
reaching the portico, he heard a moaning
of di&s;tre&s;s from the hall, and when, after
loudly calling, he was an&s;wered by the
piteous cries of Beatrice. The hall door
was fa&s;tened, and, Beatrice being unable to
open it, Vivaldi, followed by Paulo, &s;prang
through one of the unclo&s;ed lattices; when
on reaching the hall, he found the hou&s;e|keeper
bound to a pillar, and learned that
<PB N="256" REF="269">
Ellena had been carried off during the night
by armed men.</P>
<P>For a moment he was almo&s;t &s;tupi&s;ied
by the &s;hock of this intelligence, and then
a&s;ked Beatrice a thou&s;and que&s;tions con|cerning
the affair, without allowing her
time to an&s;wer one of them. When, how|ever,
he had patience to listen, he learned,
that the ruffians were four in number;
that they were ma&s;ked; that two of them
had carried Ellena through the garden,
while the others, after binding Beatrice to
a pillar, threatening her with death if &s;he
made any noi&s;e, and watching over her till,
their comrades had &s;ecured their prize,
left her a pri&s;oner. This was all the inform|ation
&s;he could give re&s;pecting Ellena.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, when he could think coolly, be|lieved
he had di&s;covered the in&s;tigators
and the de&s;ign of the whole affair, and the
cau&s;e, al&s;o, of his late confinement. It
appeared that Ellena had been carried off
by order of his family, to prevent the in|tended
<PB N="257" REF="270">
marriage, and that he had been de|coyed
into the fort of Paluzzi, and kept a
pri&s;oner there, to prevent him from, inter|cepting
the &s;cheme, which his pre&s;ence at
the villa Altieri would effectually have done.
He had him&s;elf &s;poken of his former ad|venture
at Paluzzi; and it now appeared,
that his family had taken advantage of the
curio&s;ity he had expre&s;&s;ed, to lead him into
the vaults. The event of this de&s;ign was the
more certain, &s;ince, as the fort lay in the
direct road to the villa Altieri, Vivaldi could
not go thither without being ob&s;erved by the
creatures of the Marche&s;a, who, by an art|ful
manoeuvre, might make him their pri|&s;oner,
without employing violence.</P>
<P>As he con&s;idered the&s;e circum&s;tances, it
appeared certain, al&s;o, that father Schedoni
was in truth the monk who had &s;o long
haunted his &s;teps; that he was the &s;ecret
advi&s;er of his mother, and one of the au|thors
of the predicted misfortunes, which,
it &s;eemed, he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a too certain means
<PB N="258" REF="271">
of fulfilling. Yet Vivaldi, while he admit|ted
the probability of all this, reflected with
new-a&s;toni&s;hment on the conduct of Sche|doni,
during his interview with him in the
Marche&s;a's cabinet;&mdash;the air of dignified
innocence, with which he had repre&s;&s;ed ac|cu&s;ation,
the apparent &s;implicity, with which
he had pointed out circum&s;tances re&s;pecting
the &s;tranger, that &s;eemed to make again&s;t
him&s;elf; and Vivaldi's opinion of the con|fe&s;&s;or's
duplicity began to waver. &startq;Yet
what other per&s;on,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;could be &s;o
intimately acquainted with my concerns, or
have an intere&s;t &s;ufficiently &s;trong for thus
indefatigably thwarting me, except this
confe&s;&s;or, who is, no doubt, well rewarded
for his per&s;everance? The monk can be
no other than Schedoni, yet it is &s;trange
that he &s;hould have forborn to di&s;gui&s;e his
per&s;on, and &s;hould appear in his my&s;terious
office in the very habit he u&s;ually wears!&endq;</P>
<P>Whatever might be the truth as to Sche|doni
it was evident that Ellena had been
<PB N="259" REF="272">
carried away by order of Vivaldi's family,
and he immediately returned towards Naples
with an intention of demanding her at their
hands, not with any hope of their com|pliance,
but believing that they might ac|cidentally
afford him &s;ome lights on the
&s;ubject. If, however, he &s;hould fail to ob|tain
any hint that might a&s;&s;i&s;t him in trace|ing
the route &s;he had been carried, he de|termined
to vi&s;it Schedoni, accu&s;e him of
per&s;idy, urge him to a full explanation of
his conduct, and, if po&s;&s;ible, obtain from
him a knowledge of Ellena's place of con|finement.</P>
<P>When, at length, he obtained an inter|view
with the Marche&s;e, and, throwing him|&s;elf
at his feet, &s;upplicated that Ellena might
be re&s;tored to her home, the unaffected
&s;urprize of his father overwhelmed him
with a&s;toni&s;hment and de&s;pair. The look
and manner of the Marche&s;e could not be
doubted; Vivaldi was convinced that he
<PB N="260" REF="273">
was ab&s;olutely ignorant of any &s;tep which
had been taken again&s;t Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;However ungraciou&s;ly you have con|ducted
your&s;elf,&endq; &s;aid the Marche&s;e, &startq;my
honour has never yet been &s;ullied by dupli|city;
however I may have wi&s;hed to break
the unworthy connection you have formed,
I &s;hould di&s;dain to employ artifice as the
means. If you really de&s;ign to marry this
per&s;on, I &s;hall make no other effort to pre|vent
&s;uch a mea&s;ure, than by telling you
the consequence you are to expect;&mdash;from
thenceforth I will di&s;own you for my &s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>The Marche&s;e quitted the apartment
when he had &s;aid this, and Vivaldi made
no attempt to detain him. His words: ex|pre&s;&s;ed
little more than they had formerly
done, yet Vivaldi was &s;hocked by the ab|&s;olute
menace now delivered. The &s;trong|er
pa&s;&s;ion of his heart, however, &s;oon over|came
their effect; and this moment, when
he began to fear that he had irrecoverably
lo&s;t the object of his deare&s;t affections, was
<PB N="261" REF="274">
not the time, in which he could long feel
remoter evils, or calculate the force of mi&s;|fortunes
which never might arrive. The
nearer intere&s;t pre&s;&s;ed &s;olely upon his mind,
and he was con&s;cious only to the lo&s;s of
Ellena.</P>
<P>The interview, which followed with his
mother, was of a different character from
that, which had occurred with the Marche&s;e.
The keen dart of &s;u&s;picion, however, &s;harp|ened
as it was by love and by de&s;pair,
pierced beyond the veil of her duplicity;
and Vivaldi as quickly detected her hypo|cri&s;y
as he had yielded his conviction to the
&s;incerity of the Marche&s;e. But his power
re&s;ted here; he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no means of awaken|ing
her pity or actuating her ju&s;tice, and
could not obtain even a hint, that might
guide him in his &s;earch of Ellena.</P>
<P>Schedoni, however, yet remained to be
tried; Vivaldi had no longer a doubt as to
his having caballed with the Marche&s;a, and
that he had been an agent in removing El|lena.
<PB N="262" REF="275">
Whether he was the per&s;on who
haunted the ruins of Paluzzi, &s;till remained
to be proved, for, though &s;everal circum|&s;tances
&s;eemed to declare that he was,
others, not le&s;s plau&s;ible, a&s;&s;erted the con|trary.</P>
<P>On leaving the Marche&s;a's apartment,
Vivaldi repaired to the convent of the Spi|rito
Santo, and enquired for father Sche|doni.
The lay-brother who opened the
gate, informed him that the father was in
his cell, and Vivaldi &s;tepped impatiently into
the court reque&s;ting to be &s;hewn thither.</P>
<P>&startq;I dare not leave the gate, Signor,&endq;
&s;aid the brother, &startq;but if you cro&s;s the
court, and a&s;cend that &s;tair-ca&s;e which you
&s;ee yonder beyond the door-way on your
right, it will lead you to a gallery, and the
third door you will come to is father Sche|doni's.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi pa&s;&s;ed on without &s;eeing another
human being, and not a &s;ound di&s;turbed
the &s;ilence of this &s;anctuary, till, as he
<PB N="263" REF="276">
a&s;cended the &s;tairs, a feeble note of lament|ation,
proceeded from the gallery, and he
concluded it was uttered by &s;ome penitent
at confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>He &s;topped, as he had been directed, at
the third door, when, as he gently knock|ed,
the &s;ound cea&s;ed, and the &s;ame pro|found
&s;ilence returned. Vivaldi repeated
his &s;ummons, but, receiving no an&s;wer, he
ventured to open the door. In the du&s;ky
cell within no per&s;on appeared, but he &s;till
looked round, expecting to di&s;cover &s;ome
one in the dubious gloom. The chamber
contained little more than a mattre&s;s, a chair,
a table, and a cruci&s;ix; &s;ome books of devo|tion
were upon the table, one or two of
which were written in unknown charac|ters;
&s;everal in&s;truments of torture lay be|&s;ide
them. Vivaldi &s;huddered as he ha&s;tily
examined the&s;e, though he did not compre|hend
the manner of their application, and
he left the chamber, without noticing any
other object, and returned to the court.
<PB N="264" REF="277">
The porter &s;aid, that &s;ince father Schedoni
was not in his cell, he was probably either
in the church or in the gardens, for that he
had not pa&s;&s;ed the gates during the morning.</P>
<P>&startq;Did he pa&s;s ye&s;ter-evening?&endq; &s;aid Vi|valid,
eagerly.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, he returned to ve&s;pers,&startq;replied
the brother with &s;urprize.</P>
<P>&endq; Are you certain as to that, my friend?&endq;
rejoined Vivaldi, &startq;are you certain that he
&s;lept in the convent la&s;t night?&endq;</P>
<P>&endq; Who is it that a&s;ks the que&s;tion?&endq; &s;aid
the lay-brother, with di&s;plea&s;ure, &startq;and
what right has he to make it? You are
ignorant of the rules of our hou&s;e, Signor,
or you would perceive &s;uch questions to be
unnece&s;&s;ary; any member of our com|munity
is liable to be &s;everely puni&s;hed if
he &s;leep a night without the&s;e walls, and
father Schedoni would be the la&s;t among
us &s;o to tre&s;pa&s;s. He is one of the mo&s;t
pious of the brotherhood; few indeed have
<PB N="265" REF="278">
courage to imitate his &s;evere example. His
voluntary &s;ufferings are &s;ufficient for a &s;aint.
He pa&s;s the night abroad? Go, Signor, yon|der
is the church, you will find him there,
perhaps.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi did not linger to reply. &startq;The
hypocrite!&endq; &s;aid he to him&s;elf as he cro&s;&s;|ed
to the church, which formed one &s;ide
of the quadrangle; &startq;but I will unma&s;k
him.&endq;</P>
<P>The church, which he entered, was va|cant
and &s;ilent like the court. &startq;Whither
can the inhabitants of this place have with|drawn
them&s;elves?&endq; &s;aid he; &startq;wherever
I go, I hear only the echoes of my own
foot&s;teps; it &s;eems as if death reigned here
over all! But, perhaps, it is one of the
hours of general meditation, and the monks
have only retired to their cells.&endq;</P>
<P>As he paced the long ai&s;les, he &s;uddenly
&s;topped to catch the &s;tartling &s;ound that
murmured through the lo&s;ty roof; but it
&s;eemed to be only the clo&s;ing of a di&s;tant
<PB N="266" REF="279">
door. Yet he often looked forward into
the &s;acred gloom, which the painted win|dows
threw over the remote per&s;pective,
in the expectation of perceiving a monk.
He was not long di&s;appointed; a per&s;on
appeared, &s;tanding &s;ilently in an ob&s;cure
part of the cloi&s;ter, cloathed in the habit
of this &s;ociety, and he advanced towards
him.</P>
<P>The monk did not avoid Vivaldi, or even
turn to ob&s;erve who was approaching, but
remained in the &s;ame attitude, fixed like a
&s;tatue. This tall and gaunt figure had, at
a di&s;tance, reminded him of Schedoni, and
Vivaldi, as he now looked under the cowl,
di&s;covered the gha&s;tly countenance of the
confe&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>&startq;Have I found you at la&s;t?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi.
&startq;I would &s;peak with you, father, in pri|vate.
This is not a proper place for &s;uch
di&s;cour&s;e as we mu&s;t hold.&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni made no reply, and Vivaldi,
once again looking at him, ob&s;erved that
<PB N="267" REF="280">
his features were fixed, and his eyes bent
towards the ground. The words of Vi|valid
&s;eemed not to have reached his under|&s;tanding,
nor even to have made any im|pre&s;&s;ion
on his &s;en&s;es.</P>
<P>He repeated them in a louder tone, but
&s;till not a &s;ingle line of Schedoni's counte|nance
acknowledged their influence. &startq;What
means this mummery?&endq; &s;aid he, his pa|tience
exhau&s;ted, and his indignation arou&s;|ed;
&startq;This wretched &s;ubterfuge &s;hall not
protect you, you are detected, your &s;tra|tagems
are known! Re&s;tore Ellena di Ro|&s;alba
to her home, or confe&s;s where you
have concealed her.&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni was &s;till &s;ilent and unmoved.
A re&s;pect for his age and profe&s;&s;ion with|held
Vivaldi from &s;eizing and compelling
him to an&s;wer; but the agony of impa|tience
and indignation which he &s;uffered,
formed a &s;triking contra&s;t to the death-like
apathy of the monk. &startq;I now al&s;o know
you,&endq; continued Vivaldi, &startq;for my tormentor
<PB N="268" REF="281">
at Paluzzi, the prophet of evils, which
you too well practi&s;ed the means of fulfil|ling,
the predictor of the death of Signora
Bianchi.&endq; Schedoni frowned. &startq;The fore|warner
of Ellena's departure; the phan|tom
who decoyed me into the dungeons of
Paluzzi; the prophet and the artificer of
all my misfortunes.&endq;</P>
<P>The monk rai&s;ed his eyes from the
ground, and fixed them with terrible ex|pre&s;&s;ion
upon Vivaldi, but was &s;till &s;ilent.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, father,&endq; added Vivaldi, &startq;I know
and will proclaim you to the world. I will
&s;trip you of the holy hypocri&s;y in which
you &s;hroud your&s;elf; announce to all your
&s;ociety the de&s;picable artifices you have em|ployed,
and the mi&s;ery you have occa&s;ion|ed.
Your character &s;hall be announced
aloud.&endq;</P>
<P>While Vivaldi &s;poke, the monk had
withdrawn his eyes, and fixed them again
on the ground. His countenance had re|&s;umed
its u&s;ual expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="269" REF="282">
&startq;Wretch! re&s;tore to me Ellena di Ro|&s;alba!&endq;
cried Vivaldi, with the &s;udden
angui&s;h of renewed de&s;pair. &startq;Tell me at
lea&s;t, where &s;he may be found, or you &s;hall
be compelled to do &s;o. Whither, whither
have you conveyed her?&endq;</P>
<P>As he pronounced this in loud and pa&s;|&s;ionate
accents, &s;everal eccle&s;ia&s;tics entered
the cloi&s;ters, and were pa&s;&s;ing on to the
body of the church, when his voice arre&s;t|ed
their attention. They pau&s;ed, and per|ceiving
the &s;ingular attitude of Schedoni,
and the frantic ge&s;ticulations of Vivaldi,
ha&s;tily advanced towards them. &startq;For|bear!&endq;
&s;aid one of the &s;trangers, as he &s;eiz|ed
the cloak of Vivaldi, &startq;do you not ob|&s;erve!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I ob&s;erve a hypocrite,&endq; replied Vivaldi,
&s;tepping back and di&s;engaging him&s;elf, &startq;I
ob&s;erve a de&s;troyer of the peace, it was his
duty to protect. I&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Forbear this de&s;perate conduct,&endq; &s;aid
the prie&s;t, &startq;le&s;t it provoke the ju&s;t venge|ance
<PB N="270" REF="283">
of Heaven! Do you not ob&s;erve the
holy office in which he is engaged?&endq; pointing
to the monk, &startq;Leave the church while you
are permitted to do &s;o in &s;afety; you &s;u&s;|pect
not the puni&s;hment you may provoke.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will not quit the &s;pot till you an&s;wer
my enquiries,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi to Schedoni,
without deigning even to look upon the prie&s;t;
&startq;Where, I repeat, is Ellena di Ro&s;alba?&endq;</P>
<P>The confe&s;&s;or was &s;till &s;ilent and unmov|ed.
&startq;This is beyond all patience, and all
belief,&endq; continued Vivaldi. &startq;Speak! An|&s;wer
me, or dread what I may unfold. Yet
&s;ilent! Do you know the convent <HI>del Pian|to?</HI>
Do you know the confe&s;&s;ional of the
<HI>Black Penitents?&endq;</HI></P>
<P>Vivaldi thought he perceived the coun|tenance
of the monk &s;uffer &s;ome change.
&startq;Do you remember that terrible night,&endq;
he added, &startq;when, on the &s;teps of that con|fe&s;&s;ional,
a tale was told?&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Schedoni rai&s;ed his eyes, and fixing$ them
once more on Vivaldi, with a look that
<PB N="271" REF="284">
&s;eemed intended to &s;trike him to the du&s;t,
&startq;Avaunt!&endq; cried he in a tremendous
voice; &startq;avaunt! &s;acrilegious boy!. Tremble
for the con&s;equence of thy de&s;perate im|piety!&endq;.</P>
<P>As he concluded, he &s;tarted from his
po&s;ition, and gliding, with the &s;ilent &s;wift|ne&s;s
of a &s;hadow along the cloi&s;ter, vani&s;hed
in an in&s;tant. Vivaldi, when attempting to
pur&s;ue him, was &s;eized by the &s;urrounding
monks. In&s;en&s;ible to his &s;ufferings, and
exa&s;perated by his a&s;&s;ertions, they threaten|ed,
that if he did not immediately leave the
convent, he &s;hould be confined, and under|go
the &s;evere puni&s;hment to which he had
become liable, for having di&s;turbed and even
in&s;ulted one of their holy order while per|forming
an act of penance.</P>
<P>&startq;He has need of &s;uch acts,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi;
&startq;but when can they re&s;tore the happine&s;s
his treachery has de&s;troyed? Your order is
di&s;graced by &s;uch a member, reverend fa|thers;
your&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="272" REF="285">
&startq;Peace!&endq; cried a monk, &startq;he is the
pride of our hou&s;e; he is &s;evere in his de|votion,
and in &s;elf-puni&s;hment terrible, be|yond
the reach of&mdash;But I am throwing
away my commendations, I am talking to
one who is not permitted to value or to un|der&s;tand
the &s;acred my&s;teries of our exer|ci&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Away with him to the <HI>Padre Abbate!&endq;</HI>
cried an enraged prie&s;t; &startq;away with him
to the dungeon!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Away! away!&endq; repeated his compa|nions,
and they endeavoured to force Vival|di
through the cloi&s;ters. But with the &s;ud|den
&s;trength which pride and indignation
lent him, he bur&s;t from their united hold,
and, quitting the church by another door,
e&s;caped into the &s;treet.</P>
<P>Vivaldi returned home in a &s;tate of mind
that would have engaged the pity of any
heart, which prejudice or &s;elf-intere&s;t had
not hardened. He avoided his father, but
&s;ought the Marche&s;a, who, triumphant in
<PB N="273" REF="286">
the &s;ucce&s;s of her plan, was &s;till in&s;en&s;ible
to the &s;ufferings of her &s;on.</P>
<P>When the Marche&s;a had been informed
of his approaching marriage, &s;he had, as
u&s;ual, con&s;ulted with her confe&s;&s;or on the
means of preventing it, who had advi&s;ed
the &s;cheme &s;he adopted, a &s;cheme which
was the more ea&s;ily carried into effect, &s;ince
the Marche&s;a had early in life been ac|quainted
with the abbe&s;s of San Stefano,
and knew, therefore, enough of her cha|racter
and di&s;po&s;ition to confide, without
he&s;itation, the management of this import|ant
affair to her di&s;cretion. The an&s;wer of
the abbe&s;s to her propo&s;al, was not merely
acquie&s;cent, but zealous, and it appeared
that &s;he too faithfully ju&s;tified the confidence
repo&s;ed in her. After this plan had been
&s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully pro&s;ecuted, it was not to be
hoped that the Marche&s;a would be pre|vailed
upon to relinqui&s;h it by the tears,
the angui&s;h, or all the varied &s;ufferings of her
&s;on. Vivaldi now reproved the ea&s;ine&s;s of
<PB N="274" REF="287">
his own confidence in having hoped it, and
quitted her cabinet with a de&s;pondency that
almo&s;t reached de&s;pair.</P>
<P>The faithful Paulo obeyed the ha&s;ty &s;um|mons
of his ma&s;ter, but he had not &s;ucceed|ed
in obtaining intelligence of Ellena; and
Vivaldi, having di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him again on the
&s;ame enquiry, retired to his apartment,
where the exce&s;s of grief, and a feeble hope
of devi&s;ing &s;ome &s;ucce&s;sful mode of re|medy,
alternately agitated and detained
him.</P>
<P>In the evening, re&s;tle&s;s and anxious for
change, though &s;carcely knowing whither
to bend his cour&s;e, he left the palace, and
&s;trolled down to the &s;ea-beach. A few
fi&s;hermen and lazzaroni only were loitering
along the &s;trand, waiting for boats from St.
Lucia. Vivaldi, with folded arms, and his
hat drawn over his face to &s;hade his$ &s;orrow
from ob&s;ervation, paced the edge of the
waves, li&s;tening to their murmur, as they
broke gently at his feet, and gazing upon
<PB N="275" REF="288">
their Undulating beauty, while all con&s;ciou&s;|ne&s;s
was lo&s;t in melancholy reverie con|cerning
Ellena. Her late re&s;idence appear|ed
at a di&s;tance, ri&s;ing over the &s;hore. He re|membered
how often, from thence they had
together viewed this lovely &s;cene! Its fea|tures
had now lo&s;t their charm; they were
colourle&s;s and unintere&s;ting, or impre&s;&s;ed,
only mournful ideas. The &s;ea fluctuating
beneath the &s;etting &s;un, the long mole and
its light-hou&s;e tipped with the la&s;t rays,
fi&s;hermen repo&s;ing in the &s;hade, little boats
kimming over the, &s;mooth waters, which
their oars &s;carcely dimpled; the&s;e were
images that brought to his recollection the
affecting evening when he had la&s;t &s;een this
picture from the villa Altieri, when, &s;eated
in the orangery with Ellena and Bianchi, on
the night preceding the death of the latter,
Ellena her&s;elf had &s;o &s;olemnly been given
to his care, and had &s;o affectingly con&s;ent|ed
to the dying reque&s;t of her relative. The
recollection of that &s;cene came to Vivaldi
<PB N="276" REF="289">
with all the force of contra&s;t, and renewed
all the angui&s;h of de&s;pair; he paced the
beach with quicker &s;teps, and long groans
bur&s;t from his heart. He accu&s;ed him&s;elf
of indifference and inactivity, for having
been thus long unable to di&s;cover a &s;ingle
circum&s;tance which might direct his &s;earch;
and though he knew not whither to go, he
determined to leave Naples immediately,
and return no more to his father's man&s;ion
till he &s;hould have re&s;cued Ellena.</P>
<P>Of &s;ome fi&s;hermen who were conver&s;ing
together upon the beach, he enquired
whether they could accommodate him with
a boat, in which he meant to coa&s;t the bay;
for it appeared probable that Ellena had
been conveyed from Altieri by water, to
&s;ome town or convent on the &s;hore, the
privacy and facility of &s;uch a mode of con|veyance
being &s;uitable to the de&s;igns of her
enemies.</P>
<P>&startq;I have but one boat, Signor,&endq; &s;aid a
fi&s;herman, &startq;and that is bu&s;y enough in go|ing
<PB N="277" REF="290">
to and fro between here and Santa
Lucia, but my comrade, here, perhaps can
&s;erve you. What, Carlo, can you help
the Signor to your little-&s;kiff? the other,
I know, has enough to do in the trade.&endq;</P>
<P>His comrade, however, was too much
engaged with a party of three or four men,
who were li&s;tening in deep attention
round him, to reply; Vivaldi advancing to
urge the que&s;tion, was &s;truck by the eager|ne&s;s
with which he delivered his narrative,
as well as the uncouthne&s;s of his ge&s;ticula|tion;
and he pau&s;ed a moment in attention.
One of the auditors &s;eemed to doubt of
&s;omething that had been a&s;&s;erted. &startq;I tell
you,&endq; replied the narrator, &startq;I u&s;ed to
carry fi&s;h there, two and three times a
week, and very good fort of people they
were; they have laid out many a ducat
with me in their time. But as I was &s;ay|ing,
when I got there, and knocked upon
the door, I heard, all of a &s;udden, a huge
groaning, and pre&s;ently I heard the voice
<PB N="278" REF="291">
of the old hou&s;ekeeper her&s;elf, roaring out
for help; but I could give her none, for
the door was fa&s;tened; and, while I ran
away for a&s;&s;i&s;tance to old Bartoli, you know
old Bartoli, he lives by the road &s;ide as you
go to Naples; well, while I ran to him,
comes a Signor, and jumps through the
window and &s;ets her at liberty at once. So
then, I heard the whole &s;tory.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;What &s;tory?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;and of
whom do you &s;peak?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;All in good time, <HI>Mae&s;tro,</HI> you &s;hall
hear,&endq; &s;aid the fi&s;herman, who looking at
him for a moment, added, &startq;Why, Signor,
it &s;hould be you I &s;aw there, you &s;hould be
the very Signor that let Beatrice loo&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who had &s;carcely doubted be|fore,
that it was Altieri of which the man
had &s;poken, now a&s;ked a thou&s;and que&s;tions
re&s;pecting the route the ruffians had taken
Ellena, but obtained no relief to his anx|iety.</P>
<P><PB N="279" REF="292">
&startq;I &s;hould not wonder,&endq; &s;aid, a Lazzaro
Who had been li&s;tening to the relation; &startq;I
&s;hould not wonder if the carriage that pa&s;&s;|ed
Bracelli early on the &s;ame morning, with
the blinds drawn up, though it was &s;o hot
that people could &s;carcely breathe in the
open air, &s;hould prove to be it which carried
off the lady!&endq;</P>
<P>This hint was &s;ufficient to reanimate Vi|valdi,
who collected all the information the
Lazzaro could give, which was, however,
little more than that a carriage, &s;uch as he
de&s;cribed, had been &s;een by him, driving
furiou&s;ly through Bracelli, early on the
morning mentioned as that of Signora di
Ro&s;alba's departure. Vivaldi had now no
doubt as to its being the one which, con|veyed
her away, and he determined to &s;et
out immediately for that place, where he
hoped to obtain from the po&s;t-ma&s;ter fur|ther
intelligence concerning the road &s;he
had pur&s;ued.</P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="293">
With this intention he returned once
more to his father's man&s;ion, not to ac|quaint
him with his purpo&s;e, or to bid him
farewel, but to await the return of his
&s;ervant Paulo, who he meant &s;hould ac|company
him in the &s;earch. Vivaldi's
&s;pirits were now animated with hope, &s;len|der
as were the circum&s;tances that &s;upport|ed
it; and, believing his de&s;ign to be wholly
un&s;u&s;pected by tho&s;e who would be di&s;|po&s;ed
to interrupt it, he did not guard either
again&s;t the mea&s;ures, which might impede
his departure from Naples, or tho&s;e which
might overtake him on his journey.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<Q>&startq;What, would'&s;t thou have a &s;erpent &s;ting thee
twice?&endq; <BIBL>SHAKESPEAR.</BIBL></Q>
<P>THE Marche&s;a, alarmed at &s;ome hints
dropped by Vivaldi in the late interview
between them, and by &s;ome circum&s;tances
of his latter conduct, &s;ummoned her con|&s;tant
advi&s;er, Schedoni. Still &s;uffering with
the in&s;ult he had received in the church of
the <HI>Spirito Santo,</HI> he obeyed with &s;ullen re|luctance,
yet not without a malicious hope
of di&s;covering &s;ome opportunity for retalia|tion.
That in&s;ult, which had pointed forth
his hypocri&s;y, and ridiculed the &s;olemn ab|&s;traction
he a&s;&s;umed, had &s;unk deep in his
heart, and, fermenting the dire&s;t pa&s;&s;ions of
his nature, he meditated a terrible revenge.
It had &s;ubjected him to mortifications of
<PB N="282" REF="295">
various kinds. Ambition, it has already
appeared, was one of his &s;tronge&s;t motives
of action, and he had long &s;ince a&s;&s;umed
a character of &s;evere &s;anctity, chiefly for the
purpo&s;es of lifting him to promotion. He
was not beloved in the &s;ociety of which he
was a member; and many of the brother|hood,
who had laboured to di&s;appoint his
views, and to detect his errors, who hated
him for his pride, and envied him for his
reputed &s;anctity, now gloried in the morti|fication
he had received, and endeavoured
to turn the circum&s;tance to their own ad|vantage.
They had not &s;crupled already
to di&s;play by in&s;inuation and pointed &s;neers,
their triumph, and to menace his reputa|tion;
and Schedoni, though he de&s;erved
contempt, was not of a temper to endure
it.</P>
<P>But above all, &s;ome hints re&s;pecting his
pa&s;t life, which had fallen from Vivaldi, and
which occa&s;ioned him &s;o abruptly to leave
the church, alarmed him. So much terror,
<PB N="283" REF="296">
indeed, had they excited, that it is not im|probable
that he would have &s;ealed his
&s;ecret in death, devoting Vivaldi to the grave,
had he not been re&s;trained by the d$eaded
vengeance of the Vivaldi, family. Since
that hour he had known no peace, and had
never &s;lept; he had taken &s;carcely any
food, and was almo&s;t continually on his
knees upon the &s;teps of the high altar. The
devotees who beheld him, pau&s;ed and ad|mired;
&s;uch of the brothers as di&s;liked
him, &s;neered and pa&s;&s;ed on. Schedoni ap|peared
alike in&s;en&s;ible to each; lo&s;t to this
world, and preparing for a higher.</P>
<P>The torments of his mind and the &s;evere
penance he had ob&s;erved, had produced a
&s;urpri&s;ing change in his appearance, &s;o that
he re&s;embled a &s;pectre rather, than a human
being. His vi&s;age was wan and wa&s;ted,
his, eyes were &s;unk and become nearly mo|tionle&s;s,
and his whole air and attitudes ex|hibited
the wild energy of &s;omething&mdash;not
of this earth.</P>
<P><PB N="284" REF="297">
When he was &s;ummoned by the Mar|che&s;a,
his con&s;cience whi&s;pered this to be
the con&s;equence of circum&s;tances, which
Vivaldi had revealed; and, at fir&s;t, he had
determined not to attend her; but, con&s;i|dering
that if it was &s;o, his refu&s;al would
confirm &s;u&s;picion, he re&s;olved to tru&s;t once
more to the &s;ubtilty of his addre&s;s for de|liverance.</P>
<P>With the&s;e apprehen&s;ions, tempered by
this hope, he entered the Marche&s;a's clo&s;et.
She almo&s;t &s;tarted on ob&s;erving him, and
could not immediately withdraw her eyes
from his altered vi&s;age, while Schedoni was
unable wholly to conceal the perturbation
which &s;uch earne&s;t ob&s;ervation occa&s;ioned.
&startq;Peace re&s;t with you, daughter!&endq; &s;aid he,
and he &s;eated him&s;elf, without lifting his
eyes from the floor.</P>
<P>&startq;I wi&s;hed to &s;peak with you, father,
upon affairs of moment,&endq; &s;aid the Marche&s;a
gravely, &startq;which are probably not unknown
to you.&endq; She pau&s;ed, and Schedoni bowed
<PB N="285" REF="298">
his head, awaiting in anxious expectation
what was to follow.</P>
<P>&startq;You are &s;ilent, father,&endq; re&s;umed the
Marche&s;a. &startq;What am I to under&s;tand by
this?</P>
<P>&startq;That you have been mi&s;informed,&endq;
replied Schedoni, who&s;e apt conscience be|trayed
his di&s;cretion.</P>
<P>&startq;Pardon me,&endq; &s;aid the Marche&s;a, &startq;I am
too well informed, and &s;hould not have re|que&s;ted
your vi&s;it if any doubt had remain|ed
upon my mind.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Signora! be cautious of what you
credit,&endq; &s;aid the confe&s;&s;or imprudently;
&startq;you know not the con&s;equence of a ha&s;ty
credulity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Would that mine were a ra&s;h credu|lity!&endq;
replied the Marche&s;a; &startq;but&mdash;we are
betrayed.&endq;</P>
<P><HI>&startq;We?&endq;</HI> repeated the monk, beginning to
revive: &startq;What has happened?&endq;</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a informed him of Vivaldi's
ab&s;ence, and inferred from its length, for
<PB N="286" REF="299">
it was now &s;everal days &s;ince his departure,
that he had certainly di&s;covered the place of
Ellena's confinement, as well as the authors,
of it.</P>
<P>Schedoni differed from her, but hinted,
that the obedience of youth was hopele&s;s,
unle&s;s &s;everer mea&s;ures were adopted.</P>
<P>&startq;Severer!&endq; exclaimed the Marche&s;a;
&startq;good father, is it not &s;evere enough' to
confine her for life?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mean &s;everer with re&s;pect to your
&s;on, lady,&endq; replied Schedoni. &startq;When a
young man has &s;o far overcome all reve|rence
for an holy ordinance as publicly to
in&s;ult its profe&s;&s;ors, and yet more, when
that profe&s;&s;or is in the very performance of
his duties, it is time he &s;hould be control|led
with a &s;trong hand. I am not in the
practice of advi&s;ing &s;uch mea&s;ures, but the
conduct of Signor Vivaldi is &s;uch as calls
aloud for them. Public decency demands
it. For my&s;elf, indeed, I &s;hould have en|dured
patiently the indignity which has
<PB N="287" REF="300">
been offered me, receiving it as a &s;alutary
mortification, as one of tho&s;e inflictions that
purify the &s;oul from the pride which even
the holie&s;t men may uncon&s;ciou&s;ly cheri&s;h.
But I am no longer permitted to con&s;ider
my&s;elf; the public good requires that an
example &s;hould be made of the horrible
impiety of which your &s;on, it grieves
me, daughter, to di&s;clo&s;e it!&mdash;your &s;on,
unworthy of &s;uch a mother! has been
guilty.&endq;</P>
<P>It is evident that in the &s;tyle, at lea&s;t, of
this accu&s;ation, Schedoni &s;uffered the force
of his re&s;entment to prevail over the u&s;ual
&s;ubtilty of his addre&s;s, the deep and &s;mooth
in&s;inuation of his policy.</P>
<P>&startq;To what do you allude, righteous fa|ther?&endq;
enquired the a&s;toni&s;hed Marche&s;a;
&startq;what indignity, what impiety has my &s;on
to an&s;wer for? I entreat you will &s;peak
explicitly, that I may prove I can lo&s;e the
mother in the &s;trict &s;everity of the judge.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="288" REF="301">
&startq;That is &s;poken with the grandeur of
&s;entiment, which has always di&s;tingui&s;hed
you, my daughter! Strong minds perceive
that ju&s;tice is the highe&s;t of the moral at|tributes,
mercy is only the favourite of
weak ones.&endq;</P>
<P>Schedoni had a view in this commenda|tion
beyond that of confirming the Marche|&s;a's
pre&s;ent re&s;olution again&s;t Vivaldi. He
wi&s;hed to prepare her for mea&s;ures, which
might hereafter be nece&s;&s;ary to accompli&s;h
the revenge he meditated, and he knew
that by flattering her vanity, he was mo&s;t
likely to &s;ucceed. He prai&s;ed her, therefore,
for qualities he wi&s;hed her to po&s;&s;e&s;&s;, en|couraged
her to reject general opinions
by admiring as the &s;ymptoms of a &s;uperior
under&s;tanding, the convenient morality
upon which &s;he had occa&s;ionally acted;
and, calling &s;ternne&s;s ju&s;tice, extolled that
for &s;trength of mind, which was only callous
in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="302">
He then de&s;cribed to her Vivaldi's late
conduct in the church of the <HI>Spirito Santo,</HI>
exaggerated &s;ome offen&s;ive circum&s;tances of
it, invented others, and formed of the whole
an in&s;tance of mon&s;trous impiety and un|provoked
in&s;ult.</P>
<P>The Marche&s;a li&s;tened to the relation
with no le&s;s indignation than &s;urprize, and
her readine&s;s to adopt the confe&s;&s;or's advice
allowed him to depart with renovated &s;pirits
and mo&s;t triumphant hopes.</P>
<P>Meanwhile, the Marche&s;e remained ig|norant
of the &s;ubject of the conference
with Schedoni. His opinions had formerly
been &s;ounded, and having been found de|cidedly
again&s;t the dark policy it was
thought expedient to practi&s;e, he was never
afterwards con&s;ulted re&s;pecting Vivaldi.
Parental anxiety and affection began to re|vive
as the lengthened ab&s;ence of his &s;on
was ob&s;erved. Though jealous of his rank,
he loved Vivaldi; and, though he had never
po&s;itively believed that he de&s;igned to enter
<PB N="290" REF="303">
into a &s;acred engagement with a per&s;on,
whom the Marche&s;e con&s;idered to be &s;o
much his inferior as Ellena, he had &s;uffer|ed
doubts, which gave him con&s;iderable
unea&s;ine&s;s. The pre&s;ent extraordinary ab|&s;ence
of Vivaldi renewed his alarm. He
apprehended that if &s;he was di&s;covered at
this moment, when the fear of lo&s;ing her
for ever, and the exa&s;peration, which &s;uch
complicated oppo&s;ition occa&s;ioned, had
awakened all the pa&s;&s;ions of his &s;on, this ra&s;h
young man might be prevailed upon to
&s;ecure her for his own by the indi&s;&s;oluble
vow. On the other hand, he dreaded the
effect of Vivaldi's de&s;pair, &s;hould he fail
in the pur&s;uit; and thus, fearing at one
moment that for which he wi&s;hed in the
next, the Marche&s;e &s;uffered a tumult of
mind inferior only to his &s;on's.</P>
<P>The in&s;tructions, which he delivered to
the &s;ervants whom he &s;ent in pur&s;uit of Vi|valdi,
were given under &s;uch di&s;traction of
thought, that &s;carcely any per&s;on perfectly
<PB N="291" REF="304">
under&s;tood his commi&s;&s;ion; and, as the
Marche&s;a had been careful to conceal from
him her knowledge of Ellena's abode, he
gave no direction concerning the route to
<HI>San Stefano.</HI></P>
<P>While the Marche&s;e at Naples was thus
employed, and while Schedoni was form|ing
further plans again&s;t Ellena, Vivaldi
was wandering from village to village, and
from town to town, in pur&s;uit of her, whom
all his efforts had hitherto been un&s;ucce&s;&s;|ful
to recover. From the people at the
po&s;t-hou&s;e at Bracelli, he had obtained
little information that could direct him;
they only knew that a carriage, &s;uch as had
been already de&s;cribed to Vivaldi, with the
blinds drawn up, changed hor&s;es there on
the morning, which he remembered to be
that of Ellena's departure, and had pro|ceeded
on the road to Morgagni.</P>
<P>When Vivaldi arrived thither, all trace
of Ellena was lo&s;t; the ma&s;ter of the po&s;t
could not recollect a &s;ingle circum&s;tance
<PB N="292" REF="305">
connected with the travellers, and, even if
he had noticed them, it would have been
in&s;ufficient for Vivaldi's purpo&s;e, unle&s;s he
had al&s;o ob&s;erved the road they followed;
for at this place &s;everal roads branched off
into oppo&s;ite quarters of the country; Vi|valdi,
therefore, was reduced to chu&s;e one
of the&s;e, as chance or fancy directed; and,
as it appeared probable that the Marche&s;a
had conveyed Ellena to a convent, he de|termined
to make enquiries at every one
on his way.</P>
<P>He had now pa&s;&s;ed over &s;ome of the
wilde&s;t tracts of the Apennine, among
&s;cenes, which &s;eemed abandoned by civiliz|ed
&s;ociety to the banditti who haunted their
rece&s;&s;es. Yet even here amid&s;t wilds that
were nearly inacce&s;&s;ible, convents, with
each its &s;mall dependent hamlet, were &s;cat|tered,
and, &s;hrouded from the world by
woods and mountains, enjoyed un&s;u&s;pect|edly
many of its luxuries, and di&s;played,
unnoticed, &s;ome of its elegance. Vivaldi,
<PB N="293" REF="306">
who had vi&s;ited &s;everal of the&s;e in
&s;earch of Ellena, had been &s;urprized at the refined
courte&s;y and ho&s;pitality, with which he was
received.</P>
<P>It was on the &s;eventh day of his journey,
and near &s;un-&s;et, that he was bewildered in
the woods of Rugieri. He had received a
direction for the road he was to take at a
village &s;ome leagues di&s;tant, and had obey|ed
it confidently till now, when the path
was lo&s;t in &s;everal tracts that branched out
among the trees. The day was clo&s;ing,
and Vivaldi's &s;pirits began to fail, but
Paulo, light of heart and ever gay, com|mended
the &s;hade and plea&s;ant fre&s;hne&s;s of
the woods, and ob&s;erved, that if his ma&s;|ter
did lo&s;e his way, and was obliged to
remain here for the night, it could not be
&s;o very unlucky, for they could climb up
among the branches of a che&s;tnut, and find
a more neat and airy lodging than any inn
had yet afforded them.</P>
<P><PB N="294" REF="307">
While Paulo was thus endeavouring to
make the be&s;t of what might happen, and
his ma&s;ter was &s;unk in reverie, they &s;udden|ly
heard the &s;ound of in&s;truments and voices
from a di&s;tance. The gloom, which the
trees threw around, prevented their di&s;|tingui&s;hing
objects afar off, and not a &s;ingle
human being was vi&s;ible, nor any trace of
his art, beneath the &s;hadowy &s;cene. They
li&s;tened to a&s;certain from what direction
the &s;ounds approached, and heard a chorus
of voices, accompanied by a few in&s;tru|ments,
performing the evening &s;ervice.</P>
<P>&startq;We are near a convent, Signor,&endq; &s;aid
Paulo, &startq;li&s;ten! they are at their devo|tions.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;It is as you &s;ay,&endq; replied Vivaldi; &startq;and
we will make the be&s;t of our way towards
it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, Signor! I mu&s;t &s;ay, if we find as
good doings here as we had at the Capu|chin's,
we &s;hall have no rea&s;on to regret
<PB N="295" REF="308">
our beds <HI>al-fre&s;co</HI> among the che&s;tnut
branches.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you perceive any walls or &s;pires be|yond
the trees?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, as he led the
way.</P>
<P>&startq;None, Signor,&endq; replied Paulo; &startq;yet
we draw nearer the &s;ounds. Ah, Signor!
do you hear that note? How it dies away!
And tho&s;e in&s;truments ju&s;t touched in sym|phony!
This is not the mu&s;ic of pea&s;ants;
a convent mu&s;t be near, though we do not
&s;ee it.&endq;</P>
<P>Still as they advanced, no walls appeared.
and &s;oon after the mu&s;ic cea&s;ed; but other
&s;ounds led Vivaldi forward to a plea&s;ant
part of the woods, where, the trees open|ing,
he perceived a party of pilgrims &s;eated
on the gra&s;s. They were laughing and
conver&s;ing with much gaiety, as each &s;pread
before him the &s;upper, which he drew from
his &s;crip; while he, who appeared to be the
<HI>Father-director</HI> of the pilgrimage, &s;at with a
jovial countenance in the mid&s;t of the com|pany,
<PB N="296" REF="309">
di&s;pen&s;ing jokes and merry &s;tories,
and receiving in return a tribute from every
&s;crip. Wines of various &s;orts were rang|ed
before him, of which he drank abund|antly,
and &s;eemed not to refu&s;e any dainty
that was offered.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, who&s;e apprehen&s;ions were now
quieted, &s;topped to ob&s;erve the groupe, as
the evening rays, glancing along the &s;kirts
of the wood, threw a gleam upon their va|rious
countenances, &s;hewing, however, in
each a &s;pirit of gaiety that might have cha|racterized
the individuals of a party of plea|&s;ure,
rather than tho&s;e of a pilgrimage.
The <HI>Father-director</HI> and his flock &s;eemed
perfectly to under&s;tand each other; the
Superior willingly re&s;igned the &s;olemn au|&s;terity
of his office, and permitted the com|pany
to make them&s;elves as happy as po&s;|&s;ible,
in con&s;ideration of receiving plenty of
the mo&s;t delicate of their viands; yet &s;ome|what
of dignity was mingled with his con|de&s;cen&s;ions,
that compelled them to receive
<PB N="297" REF="310">
even his jokes with a degree of deference,
and perhaps they laughed at them le&s;s for
their &s;pirit than becau&s;e they were favors.</P>
<P>Addre&s;&s;ing the Superior, Vivaldi reque&s;t|ed
to be directed how he might regain his
way. The father examined him for a mo|ment
before he replied, but ob&s;erving the
elegance of his dre&s;s, and a certain air of
di&s;tinction; and perceiving, al&s;o, that
Paulo was his &s;ervant, he promi&s;ed his &s;er|vices,
and invited him to take a &s;eat at his
right hand, and partake of the &s;upper.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, under&s;tanding that the party
was going his road, accepted the invita|tion;
when Paulo, having fa&s;tened the
hor&s;es to a tree, &s;oon became bu&s;y with the
&s;upper. While Vivaldi conver&s;ed with the
father, Paulo engro&s;&s;ed all the attention of
the pilgrims near him; they declared he
was the clevere&s;t and the merrie&s;t fellow
they had ever &s;een, and often expre&s;&s;ed a
wi&s;h that he was going as far with them as
to the &s;hrine in a convent of Carmelites,
<PB N="298" REF="311">
which terminated their pilgrimage. When
Vivaldi under&s;tood that this &s;hrine was in
the church of a convent, partly inhabited
by nuns, and that it was little more than
a league and a half di&s;tant, he determined
to accompany them, for it was as po&s;&s;ible
that Ellena was confined there as in any
other cloi&s;ter; and of her being impri&s;oned
in &s;ome convent, he had le&s;s doubt, the
more he con&s;idered the character and views
of his mother. He &s;et forward, therefore,
with the pilgrims, and on foot, having re|&s;igned
his hor&s;e to the weary <HI>Father-di|rector.</HI></P>
<P>Darkne&s;s clo&s;ed over them long before
they reached the village where they de&s;ign|ed
to pa&s;s the night; but they beguiled
the way with &s;ongs and &s;tories, now and
then, only, &s;topping at command of the
Father, to repeat &s;ome prayer or &s;ing a
hymn. But, as they drew near a village,
at the ba&s;e of the mountain on which the
&s;hrine &s;tood, they halted to arrange them|&s;elves
<PB N="299" REF="312">
in proce&s;&s;ion; and the Superior hav|ing
&s;topped &s;hort in the mid&s;t of one of
his be&s;t jokes, di&s;mounted Vivaldi's hor&s;e,
placed him&s;elf at their head, and beginning
a loud &s;train, they proceeded in full chorus
of melancholy mu&s;ic.</P>
<P>The pea&s;ants, hearing their &s;onorous
voices, came forth to meet and conduct
them to their cabins. The village was al|ready
crowded with devotees, but the&s;e
poor pea&s;ants, looking up to them with
love and reverence, made every po&s;&s;ible
contrivance to accommodate all who came;
notwith&s;tanding which, when Paulo &s;oon
after turned into his bed of &s;traw, he had
more rea&s;ons than one to regret his che&s;tnut
mattre&s;s.</P>
<P>Vivaldi pa&s;&s;ed an anxious night, waiting
impatiently for the dawning of that day,
which might po&s;&s;ibly re&s;tore to him Ellena.
Con&s;idering that a pilgrim's habit would
not only conceal him from &s;u&s;picion, but
allow him opportunities for ob&s;ervation,
<PB N="300" REF="313">
which his own dre&s;s would not permit, he
employed Paulo to provide him one. The
addre&s;s of the &s;ervant, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by a single
ducat, ea&s;ily procured it, and at an early
hour he &s;et forward on his enquiry.</P>

<L>Of our faintly &s;i&s;ter.</L></Q>
<P>A FEW devotees only had begun to
a&s;cend the mountain, and Vivaldi kept aloof
even from the&s;e, pur&s;uing a lonely track,
for his thoughtful mind de&s;ired &s;olitude.
The early breeze &s;ighing among the foli|age,
that waved high over the path, and
the hollow da&s;hing of di&s;tant waters, he
li&s;tened to with complacency, for the&s;e were
&s;ounds which &s;oothed yet promoted his
melancholy mood; and he &s;ometimes re&s;ted
to gaze upon the &s;cenery around him, for
this too was in harmony with the temper
of his mind. Di&s;appointment had &s;ubdued
the wilder energy of the pa&s;&s;ions, and pro|duced
<PB N="302" REF="315">
a &s;olemn and lofty &s;tate of feeling;
he viewed with plea&s;ing &s;adne&s;s the dark
rocks and precipices, the gloomy mountains
and va&s;t &s;olitudes, that &s;pread around him;
nor was the convent he was approaching
a le&s;s &s;acred feature of the &s;cene, as its gray
walks and pinnacles appeared beyond the
du&s;ky groves. &startq;Ah! if it &s;hould enclo&s;e
her!&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, as he caught a fir&s;t
glimp&s;e of its hall. &startq;Vain hope! I will not
invite your illu&s;ions again, I will not ex|po&s;e
my&s;elf to the agonies of new di&s;appoint|ment;
I will &s;earch, but not expect. Yet,
if &s;he &s;hould be there!&endq;</P>
<P>Having reached the gates of the convent,
he pa&s;&s;ed with ha&s;ty &s;teps into the court;
where his emotion encrea&s;ed as he pau&s;ed a
moment and looked round its &s;ilent cloi&s;ters.
The porter only appeared, when
Vivaldi, fearful le&s;t he &s;hould perceive him
not to be a pilgrim, drew his hood over his
face, and, gathering up his garments &s;till
clo&s;er in his folded arms, pa&s;&s;ed on without
<PB N="303" REF="316">
&s;peaking, though he knew not which of the
avenues before him led to the &s;hrine. He
advanced, however, towards the church, a
&s;tately edifice, detached, and at &s;ome little
di&s;tance, from the other parts of the con|vent.
Its highly vaulted ai&s;les, extending in
twilight per&s;pective, where a monk, or a
pilgrim only, now and then cro&s;&s;ed, who&s;e
dark figures, pa&s;&s;ing without &s;ound, vani&s;h|ed
like &s;hadows; the univer&s;al &s;tillne&s;s of
the place, the gleam of tapers from the high
altar, and of lamps, which gave a gloomy
pomp to every &s;hrine in the church:&mdash;all
the&s;e circum&s;tances con&s;pired to impre&s;s a
&s;acred awe upon his heart.</P>
<P>He followed &s;ome devotees through a
&s;ide ai&s;le to a court, that was overhung by
a tremendous rock, in which was a cave, con|taining
the &s;hrine of <HI>our Lady of Mount Car|mel.</HI>
This-court was enclo&s;ed by the rock,
and by the choir of the church, except that
to the &s;outh a &s;mall opening led the eye
to a glimp&s;e of the land&s;cape below, which,
&s;een beyond the dark jaws of the cliff, ap|peared
<PB N="304" REF="317">
free, and light, and gaily coloured,
melting away into the blue and di&s;tant
mountains.</P>
<P>Vivaldi entered the cave, where, enclo&s;ed
within a filigree &s;creen of gold, lay the image
of the &s;aint, decorated with flowers and
lighted up by innumerable lamps and tapers.
The &s;teps of the &s;hrine were thronged with
kneeling pilgrims, and Vivaldi, to avoid
&s;ingularity, kneeled al&s;o; till a high peal of
the organ, at a di&s;tance, and the deep voices
of choiri&s;ters announced that the fir&s;t ma&s;s
was begun. He left the cave, and, return|ing
into the church, loitered at an extremity
of the ai&s;les, where he li&s;tened awhile to
the &s;olemn harmony pealing along the roofs,
and &s;oftening away in di&s;tance. It was &s;uch
full and entrancing mu&s;ic as frequently
&s;wells in the high fe&s;tivals of the Sicilian
church, and is adapted to in&s;pire that &s;ub|lime
enthu&s;ia&s;m, which &s;ometimes elevates
its di&s;ciples. Vivaldi, unable to endure
long the exce&s;s of feeling, which this har|mony
<PB N="305" REF="318">
awakened, was leaving the church,
when &s;uddenly it cea&s;ed, and the tolling of
a bell &s;ounded in its &s;tead. This &s;eemed to
be the knel of death, and it occurred to
him, that a dying per&s;on was approaching
to receive the la&s;t &s;acrament; when he
head remotely a warbling of female voices,
mingling with the deeper tones of the
monks, and with the hollow note of the
bell, as it &s;truck at intervals. So &s;weetly,
&s;o plaintively, did the &s;train grow on the
air, that tho&s;e, who li&s;tened, as well as tho&s;e,
who &s;ung, were touched with &s;orrow, and
&s;eemed equally to mourn for a departing
friend.</P>
<P>Vivaldi ha&s;tened to the choir, the pave|ment
of which was &s;trewn with palm-branches
and fre&s;h flowers. A pall of black
velvet lay upon the &s;teps of the altar, where
&s;everal prie&s;ts were &s;ilently attending. Every
where appeared the en&s;igns of &s;olemn pomp
and ceremony, and in every countenance
the &s;tillne&s;s and observance of expectation.
<PB N="306" REF="319">
Meanwhile the &s;ounds drew nearer, and
Vivaldi perceived a proce&s;&s;ion of nuns ap|proaching
from a di&s;tant ai&s;le.</P>
<P>As they advanced, he di&s;tingui&s;hed the
lady abbe&s;s leading the train, dre&s;&s;ed in her
pontifical robes, with the mitre on her head;
and well he marked her &s;tately &s;tep, mov|ing
in time to the &s;low min&s;trel&s;y, and
the air of proud yet graceful dignity, with
which &s;he characterized her&s;elf. Then fol|lowed
the nuns, according to their &s;e|veral
orders, and la&s;t came the novices,
carrying lighted tapers, and &s;urrounded by
other nuns, who were distingui&s;hed by a
particular habit.</P>
<P>Having reached a part of the church ap|propriated
for their reception, they arranged
them&s;elves in order. Vivaldi with a pal|pitating
heart enquired the occa&s;ion of this
ceremony, and was told that a nun was
going to be profe&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>&startq;You are informed, no doubt, brother,&endq;
added the prior who gave him this intelli|gence,
<PB N="307" REF="320">
&startq;that on the morning of our high
fe&s;tival, our <HI>lady's</HI> day, it is u&s;ual for &s;uch
as devote them&s;elves to heaven, to receive
the veil. Stand bye a while, and you will
&s;ee the ceremony.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is the name of the novice who
is now to receive it?&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, in a voice
who&s;e tremulous accents betrayed his emo|tion.</P>
<P>The friar glanced an eye of &s;crutiny
upon him, as he replied, &startq;I know not her
name, but if you will &s;tep a little this way,
I will point her out to you.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, drawing his hood over his face,
obeyed in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>&startq;It is &s;he on the right of the abbe&s;s,&endq;
&s;aid the &s;tranger, &startq;who leans on the arm
of a nun, &s;he is covered with a white veil,
and is taller than her companions.&endq;</P>
<P>Vivaldi, ob&s;erved her with a fearful eye,
and, though he did not recognize the per|&s;on
of Ellena, yet, whether it was that his
fancy was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with her image, or that
<PB N="308" REF="321">
there was truth in his &s;urmi&s;e, he thought
he perceived a re&s;emblance of her. He en|quired
how long the novice had re&s;ided in
the convent, and many other particulars,
to which the &s;tranger either could not or
dared not reply.</P>
<P>With what anxious &s;olicitude did Vi|valdi
endeavour to look through the veils
of the &s;everal nuns in &s;earch of Ellena,
whom he believed the barbarous policy of
his mother might already have devoted to
the cloi&s;ter! With a &s;olicitude &s;till &s;tronger,
he tried to catch a glimp&s;e of the features of
the novices, but their faces were &s;haded by
hoods, and their white veils, though thrown
half back, were di&s;po&s;ed in &s;uch artful folds
that they concealed them from ob&s;ervation,
as effectually as did the pendant lawn the
features of the nuns.</P>
<P>The ceremony began with the exhorta|tion
of the <HI>Father-Abbot,</HI> delivered with
&s;olemn energy; then the novice kneeling
before him, made her profe&s;&s;ion, for which
<PB N="309" REF="322">
Vivaldi li&s;tened with inten&s;e attention, but
it was delivered in &s;uch low and trembling
accents, that he could not a&s;certain even
the tone. But during the anthem that
mingled with the en&s;uing part of the &s;er|vice,
he thought he di&s;tingui&s;hed the voice
of Ellena, that touching and well-known
voice, which in the church of San Lorenzo
had fir&s;t attracted his attention. He li&s;ten|ed,
&s;carcely daring to draw breath, le&s;t he
&s;hould lo&s;e a note; and again he fancied
her voice &s;poke in a part of the plaintive re|&s;pon&s;e
delivered by the nuns.</P>
<P>Vivaldi endeavoured to command his
emotion, and to await with patience &s;ome
further unfolding of the truth; but when
the prie&s;t prepared to withdraw the white
veil from the face of the novice, and throw
the black one over her, a dreadful expect|ation
that &s;he was Ellena &s;eized him, and
he with difficulty forbore &s;tepping forward
and di&s;covering him&s;elf on the in&s;tant.</P>
<P><PB N="310" REF="323">
The veil was at length withdrawn, and
a very lovely face appeared, but not El|lena's.
Vivaldi breathed again, and waited
with tolerable compo&s;ure for the conclu|&s;ion
of the ceremony; till, in the &s;olemn
&s;train that followed the putting on of the
black veil, he heard again the voice, which
he was now convinced was her's. Its ac|cents
were low, and mournful, and tremu|lous,
yet his heart, acknowledged in&s;tanta|neou&s;ly
their magic influence.</P>
<P>When this ceremony had concluded,
another began; and he was told it was that
of a noviciation. A young woman, &s;up|ported
by two nuns, advanced to the altar,
and Vivaldi thought he beheld Ellena. The
prie&s;t was beginning the cu&s;tomary exhort|ation,
when &s;he lifted her half-veil, and,
&s;hewing a countenance where meek &s;orrow
was mingled with heavenly &s;weetne&s;s, rai&s;|ed
her blue eyes, all bathed in tears, and
waved her hand as if &s;he would have &s;poken.&mdash;It
was Ellena her&s;elf.</P>
<P><PB N="311" REF="324">
The prie&s;t attempted to proceed.</P>
<P>&startq;I prote&s;t in the pre&s;ence of this con|gregation,&endq;
&s;aid &s;he &s;olemnly, &startq;that I am
brought hither to pronounce vows which
my heart, di&s;claims. I prote&s;t&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>A confu&s;ion of voices interrupted her,
and at the &s;ame in&s;tant &s;he perceived Vival|di
ru&s;hing towards the altar. Ellena gazed
for a moment, and then, &s;tretching forth
her &s;upplicating hands towards him, clo&s;ed
her eyes, and &s;unk into the arms of &s;ome
per&s;ons round her, who vainly endeavoured
to prevent him from approaching and a&s;|&s;i&s;ting
her. The angui&s;h, with which he
bent over her lifele&s;s form, and called upon
her name, excited the commi&s;eration even
of the nuns, and e&s;pecially of Olivia, who
was mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous in efforts to revive her
young friend.</P>
<P>When Ellena unclo&s;ed her eyes, and
looking up, once more beheld Vivaldi, the
expre&s;&s;ion, with which &s;he regarded him,
told that her heart was unchanged, and
<PB N="312" REF="325">
that &s;he was uncon&s;cious of the mi&s;eries of
impri&s;onment while he was with her. She
de&s;ired to withdraw, and, a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Vival|di
and Olivia, was leaving the church,
when the abbe&s;s ordered that &s;he &s;hould be
attended by the nuns only; and, retiring
from the altar, &s;he gave directions that the
young &s;tranger &s;hould be conducted to the
parlour of the convent.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, though he refu&s;ed to obey an
imperious command, yielded to the entrea|ties
of Ellena, and to the gentle remon|&s;trances
of Olivia; and, bidding Ellena fare|well
for a while, he repaired to the parlour
of the abbe&s;s. He was not without &s;ome
hope of awakening her to a &s;en&s;e of ju&s;tice,
or of pity; but he found that her notions
of right were inexorably again&s;t him, and
that pride and re&s;entment u&s;urped the in|fluence
of every other feeling. She began
her lecture with expre&s;&s;ing the warm friend|&s;hip
&s;he had &s;o long cheri&s;hed for the Mar|che&s;a,
proceeded to lament that the &s;on of
<PB N="313" REF="326">
a friend, whom &s;he &s;o highly e&s;teemed,
&s;hould have forgotten his duty to his pa|rents,
and the ob&s;ervance due to the dig|nity
of his hou&s;e, &s;o far as to &s;eek connec|tion
with a per&s;on of Ellena di Ro&s;alba's
inferior &s;tation; and concluded with a &s;evere
reprimand for having di&s;turbed the tran|quillity
of her convent and the decorum of
the church by has intru&s;ion.</P>
<P>Vivaldi li&s;tened with &s;ubmitting patience
to this mention of morals and, decorum
from a per&s;on, who, with the mo&s;t perfect
&s;elf-applau&s;e, was violating &s;ome of the
plaine&s;t obligations of humanity and ju&s;tice;
who had con&s;pired to tear an orphan from
her home, and who de&s;igned to deprive her
for life of liberty, with all the ble&s;&s;ings it
inherits. But, when &s;he proceeded to &s;peak
of Ellena with the cau&s;tic of &s;evere repro|bation,
and to hint at the puni&s;hment, which
her public rejection of the vows had incur|red,
the patience of Vivaldi &s;ubmitted no
longer; indignation and contempt ro&s;e
<PB N="314" REF="327">
high again&s;t the Superior, and he exhibited
a portrait of her&s;elf in the &s;trong colours of
truth. But the mind, which compa&s;&s;ion
could not per&s;uade, rea&s;on could not appal;
&s;elfi&s;hne&s;s Had hardened it alike to the in|fluence
of each; her pride only was affect|ed,
and &s;he retaliated the mortification &s;he
&s;uffered by menace and denunciation.</P>
<P>Vivaldi, on quitting her apartment, had
no other re&s;ource than an application to
the <HI>Abate,</HI> who&s;e influence, it lea&s;t, if not
his authority, might a&s;&s;uage the &s;everity of
her power. In this Abate, a mildne&s;s of
temper, and a gentlene&s;s of manner were
qualities of le&s;s value than is u&s;ually and
de&s;ervedly imputed to them; for, being
connected with feeblene&s;s of mind, they
were but the plea&s;ing merits of ea&s;y times,
which in an hour of difficulty never a&s;&s;um|ed
the character of virtues, by inducing
him to &s;erve tho&s;e, for whom he might feel.
And thus, with a temper and di&s;po&s;ition
directly opposite to tho&s;e of the &s;evere and
<PB N="315" REF="328">
violent abbe&s;s, he was equally &s;elfi&s;h, and
almo&s;t equally culpable, &s;ince by permiting
evil, he was nearly as injurious in his con|duct
as tho&s;e who planned it. Indolence
and timidity, a timidity the con&s;equence of
want of clear perception, deprived him of
all energy of character; he was prudent
rather than wi&s;e, and &s;o fearful of being
thought to do wrong that he &s;eldom did right.</P>
<P>To Vivaldi's temperate repre&s;entations
and earne&s;t entreaties that he would exert
&s;ome authority towards liberating Ellena,
he li&s;tened with patience; acknowledged the
hard&s;hips of her &s;ituation; lamented the un|happy
divi&s;ions between Vivaldi and his
family, and then declined advancing a
&s;ingle &s;tep in &s;o delicate an affair. Signora
di Ro&s;alba, he &s;aid, was in the care of the
abbe&s;s, over whom he had no right of con|trol
in matters relative to her dome&s;tic
concerns. Vivaldi then &s;upplicated, that,
though he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no authority, he would,
at lea&s;t, intercede or remon&s;trate again&s;t &s;o
<PB N="316" REF="329">
unju&s;t a procedure as that of detaining Ellena a pri&s;oner, and a&s;&s;i&s;t in re&s;toring her
to the home, from which she had been for|cibly
carried.</P>
<P>&startq;And this, again,&endq; replied the Abate,
does not come within my juri&s;diction;
and I make it a rule never to encroach upon
that of another per&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And can you endure, holy father,&endq;
&s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;to witne&s;s a flagrant act of
inju&s;tice and not endeavour to counteract
it? not even &s;tep forward to re&s;cue the vic|tim
when you perceive the preparation for
the &s;acrifice?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I repeat, that I never interfere with
the authority of others,&endq; replied the Supe|rior;
&startq;having a&s;&s;erted my own, I yield to
them in their &s;phere, the obedience which
I require in mine.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Is power then,&endq; &s;aid Vivaldi, &startq;the in|fallible
te&s;t of ju&s;tice? Is it morality to
obey where the command is criminal? The
whole world have a claim upon the forti|tude,
<PB N="317" REF="330">
the active fortitude of tho&s;e who are
placed as you are, between the alternative
of confirming a wrong by your con&s;ent, or
preventing it by your re&s;i&s;tance. Would
that your heart expanded towards that
world, reverend father!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Would that the whole world were
wrong that you might have the glory of
&s;etting it right!&endq; &s;aid the Abate, &s;miling.
&startq;Young man! you are an enthu&s;ia&s;t, and
I pardon you. You are a knight of chi|valry,
who would go about the earth fight|ing
with every body by way of proving
your right to do good; it is unfortunate
that you are born &s;omewhat too late.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Enthu&s;ia&s;m in the cau&s;e of humanity&endq;&mdash;&s;aid
Vivaldi, but he checked him&s;elf; and
de&s;pairing of touching a heart &s;o hardened
by &s;elfi&s;h prudence, and indigna$$ at be|holding
an apathy &s;o vicious in its con&s;equence,
he left the Abate without other ef|fort.
He perceived that he mu&s;t now have re|cour&s;e
to further &s;tratagem, a recour&s;e which
<PB N="318" REF="331">
his frank and noble mind dete&s;ted, but he
had already tried, without &s;ucce&s;s, every
other po&s;&s;ibility of re&s;cuing the innocent vic|tim
of the Marche&s;a's prejudice and pride.</P>
<P>Ellena meanwhile had retired to her cell,
agitated by a variety of con&s;iderations, and
contrary emotions, of which, however,
tho&s;e of joy and tenderne&s;s were long
predominant. Then came anxiety, appre|hen&s;ion,
pride, and doubt, to divide and
torture her heart. It was true that Vivaldi
had di&s;covered her pri&s;on, but, if it were
po&s;&s;ible, that he could relea&s;e her, &s;he mu&s;t
con&s;ent to quit it with him; a &s;tep from
which a mind &s;o tremblingly jealous of pro|priety
as hers, recoiled with alarm, though
it would deliver her from captivity. And
how, when &s;he con&s;idered the haughty
character of the Marche&s;e di Vivaldi, the
imperious and vindictive nature of the
Marche&s;a, and, &s;till more, their united repug|nance
to a connection with her, how could
&s;he endure to think, even for a moment, of
<PB N="319" REF="332">
intruding her&s;elf into &s;uch a family! Pride,
delicacy, good &s;en&s;e &s;eemed to warn her
again&s;t a conduct &s;o humiliating and vexa|tious
in its con&s;equences, and to exhort her to
pre&s;erve her own dignity by independence;
but the e&s;teem, the friend&s;hip, the tender affection, which &s;he had cherished for Vivaldi,
made her pau&s;e, and &s;hrink with emotions,
of little le&s;e than horror, from the eternal
renunciation, which &s;o dignified a choice
required. Though the encouragements,
which her decea&s;ed relative had given to
this attachment, &s;eemed to impart to it a
&s;acred character, that con&s;iderably &s;oothed
the alarmed delicacy of Ellena, the appro|bation
thus implied, had no power to &s;ilence
her own objections, and &s;he would have
regretted the mi&s;taken zeal, which had con|tributed
to lead her into the pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;|ing
&s;ituation, had &s;he revered the memory
of her aunt, or loved Vivaldi, le&s;s. Still,
however, the joy, which his pre&s;ence had
occa&s;ioned, and which the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s
<PB N="320" REF="333">
that he was &s;till near her had prolonged,
was not &s;abdued, though it was frequently
ob&s;cured, by &s;uch anxious con&s;iderations.
With jealous and indi&s;creet &s;olicitude, &s;he
now recollected every look, and the accent
of every word, which had told that his affec|tion
was undimini&s;hed, thus &s;eeking, with
incon&s;i&s;tent zeal, for a conviction of the
very tenderne&s;, which but a moment before
&s;he had thought it would be prudent to la|ment,
and almo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to renounce.</P>
<P>She awaited with extreme anxiety the ap|pearance
of Olivia, who might probably
know the re&s;ult the Vivaldi's conference
with the abbe&s;s, and whether he was yet in
the convent.</P>
<P>In the evening Olivia came, a me&s;&s;enger
of evil; and Ellena, informed of the con|duct
of the abbe&s;s, and the con&s;equent de|parture
of Vivaldi, perceived all her
courage, and all the half-formed re&s;olutions,
which a con&s;ideration of his family had
&s;ugge&s;ted, faulter and expire. Sen&s;ible
<PB N="321" REF="334">
only of grief and de&s;pondency, &s;he a&s;cer|tained,
for the fir&s;t time, the extent of
her affection and the &s;everity of her &s;itua|tion.
She perceived, al&s;o, that the inju&s;tice,
which his family had exerci&s;ed towards her,
ab&s;olved her from all con&s;ideration of
their di&s;plea&s;ure, otherwi&s;e than as it might
affect her&s;elf; but this was a conviction,
which it were now probably u&s;ele&s;s to admit.</P>
<P>Olivia not only expre&s;&s;ed the tendere&s;t
intere&s;t in her welfare, but &s;eemed deeply
affected with her &s;ituation; and, whether
it was, that the nun's misfortunes bore &s;ome
re&s;emblance to Ellena's, or from whatever
cau&s;e, it is remarkable that her eyes were
often filled with tears, while &s;he regarded
her young friend, and &s;he betrayed &s;o much
emotion that Ellena noticed it with &s;urpri&s;e.
She was, however, too delicate to hint any
curio&s;ity on the &s;ubject; and too much en|gaged
by a nearer intere&s;t, to dwell long
upon the circum&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="322" REF="335">
When Olivia withdrew, Ellena retired
to her turret, &s;oothe her &s;pirits with a view
of &s;erene and maje&s;tic nature, a recourse
which &s;eldom failed to elevate her mind and
&s;often the a&s;perities of affliction. It was to
her like &s;weet and &s;olemn mu&s;ic, breathing
peace over the &s;oul&mdash;like the oaten &s;top of
Milton's Spirit,
<Q><L>&startq;Who with his &s;oft pipe, and &s;mooth-dittied &s;ong,</L>
<L>Well knew to &s;till the wild winds when they roar</L>
<L>And hu&s;h the waving woods.&endq;</L></Q></P>
<P>While &s;he &s;at before a window, ob&s;erving
the evening light beaming up the valley,
and touching all the di&s;tant mountains with
mi&s;ty purple, a reed as &s;weet, though not as
fanciful, &s;ounded from among the rocks
below. The in&s;trument and the character
of the &s;train were &s;uch as &s;he had been un|accu&s;tomed
to hear within the walls of San
Stefano, and the tone diffu&s;ed over her &s;pirits
a plea&s;ing melancholy, that rapt all her at|tention.
The liquid cadence, as it trembled
and &s;unk away, &s;eemed to tell the dejection
<PB N="323" REF="336">
of no vulgar feelings, and the exqui&s;ite ta&s;te,
with which the complaining notes were
again &s;welled, almo&s;t convinced her, that
the mu&s;ician was Vivaldi.</P>
<P>On looking from the lattice, &s;he perceiv|ed
a per&s;on perched on a point of the cliff be|low,
whither it appeared almo&s;t impracticable
for any human &s;tep to have climbed, and pre|&s;erved
from the precipice only by &s;ome dwarf
&s;hrubs that fringed the brow. The twilight
did not permit her immediately to a&s;certain
whether it was Vivaldi, and the &s;ituation
was &s;o dangerous that she hoped it was not
h$. Her doubts were removed, when, look|ing
up, he perceived Ellena, and &s;he heard
his voice.</P>
<P>Vivaldi had learned from a lay-brother of
the convent, whom Paulo had bribed, and
who, when he worked in the garden, had
&s;ometimes &s;een Ellena at the window, that
&s;he frequented this remote turret; and, at
the hazard of his life, he had now ventured
thither, with a hope of conver&s;ing with her.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="337">
Ellena, alarmed at his tremendous &s;itua|tion,
refu&s;ed to li&s;ten to him, but he would
not leave the &s;pot till he had communicat|ed
a plan concerted for her e&s;cape, and,
entreating that &s;he would confide her&s;elf to
his care, a&s;&s;ured her &s;he would be conducted
wherever &s;he judged proper. It appeared
that the brother had con&s;ented to a&s;&s;i&s;t his
views, in con&s;ideration of an ample reward,
and to admit him within the walls on this
evening, when, in his pilgrim's habit, he
might have an opportunity of again &s;eeing
Ellena. He conjured her to attend, if po&s;|&s;ible,
in the convent parlour during &s;upper,
explaining, in a few words, the motive for
this reque&s;t, and the &s;ubstance of the fol|lowing
particulars:</P>
<P>The Lady-abbe&s;s, in ob&s;ervance of the
cu&s;tom upon high fe&s;tivals, gave a collation
to the <HI>Padre-abate,</HI> and &s;uch of the prie&s;ts
as had a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the ve&s;per-&s;ervice. A few
&s;trangers of di&s;tinction and pilgrims were
al&s;o to partake of the entertainments of
<PB N="325" REF="338">
this night, among which was included a
concert to be performed by the nuns. At
the collation was to be di&s;played a profu|&s;ion
of delicacies, arranged by the &s;i&s;ters,
who had been bu&s;y in preparing the pa&s;try
and confectionary during &s;everal days, and
who excelled in the&s;e articles no le&s;s than
in embroidery and other ingenious arts.
This &s;upper was to be given in the abbe&s;s's
outer parlour, while &s;he her&s;elf, attended
by &s;ome nuns of high rank, and a few fa|vourites,
was to have a table in the inner
apartment, where, &s;eparated only by the
grate, &s;he could partake of the conver&s;ation
of the holy fathers. The tables were to be
ornamented with artificial flowers, and a
variety of other fanciful devices upon which
the ingenuity of the &s;i&s;ters had been long
employed, who prepared for the&s;e fe&s;|tivals
with as much vanity, and expected
them to di&s;&s;ipate the gloomy monotony of
their u&s;ual life, with as much eagerne&s;s of
<PB N="326" REF="339">
delight, as a young beauty anticipates a fir&s;t
ball.</P>
<P>On this evening, therefore, every mem|ber
of the convent would be engaged either
by amu&s;ement or bu&s;ine&s;s, and to Vivaldi,
who had been careful to inform him&s;elf of
the&s;e circum&s;tances, it would be ea&s;y, with
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the brother, to obtain ad|mittance,
and mingle him&s;elf among the
&s;pectators, di&s;gui&s;ed in his pilgrim's habit.
He entreated, therefore, that Ellena would
contrive to be in the abbe&s;s's apartment
this evening, when he would endeavour to
convey to her &s;ome further particulars of
the plan of e&s;cape, and would have mules
in waiting at the foot of the mountain, to
conduct her to the villa Altieri, or to the
neighbouring convent of the Santa della
Pieta. Vivaldi &s;ecretly hoped that &s;he might
be prevailed with to give him her hand on
quitting San Stefano, but he forbore to
mention this hope, le&s;t it &s;hould be mi&s;taken
for a condition, and that Ellena might
<PB N="327" REF="340">
be either reluctant to accept his a&s;&s;i&s;tance,
or, accepting it, might con&s;ider her&s;elf
bound to grant a ha&s;ty con&s;ent.</P>
<P>To his mention of e&s;cape &s;he li&s;tened
with varying emotion; at one moment at|tending
to it with hope and joy, as promi&s;|ing
her only chance of liberation from an
impri&s;onment, which was probably intend|ed
to la&s;t for her life, and of re&s;toring her
to Vivaldi; and at another, recoiling from
the thought of departing with him, while
his family was &s;o decidedly aver&s;e to their
marriage. Thus, unable to form any in|&s;tant
re&s;olution on the &s;ubject, and entreat|ing
that he would leave his dangerous &s;ta|tion
before the thickening twilight &s;hould
encrea&s;e the hazard of his de&s;cent, Ellena
added, that &s;he would endeavour to obtain
admittance to the apartment of the abbe&s;s,
and to acquaint him with her final deter|mination.
Vivaldi under&s;tood all the de|licacy
of her &s;cruples, and though they
<PB N="328" REF="341">
afficted him, he honoured the good &s;en&s;e
and ju&s;t pride that &s;ugge&s;ted them.</P>
<P>He lingered on the rock till the la&s;t mo|ments
of departing light, and then, with a
heart fluttering with hopes and fears, bade
Ellena farewel, and de&s;cended; while &s;he
watched his progre&s;s through the &s;ilent
gloom, faintly di&s;tingui&s;hing him gliding
along ledges of the precipice, and making
his adventurous way from cliff to cliff, till
the winding thickets concealed him from
her view. Still anxious, &s;he remained at
the lattice, but he appeared no more; no
voice announced di&s;a&s;ter; and, at length,
&s;he returned to her cell, to deliberate on the
&s;ubject of her departure.</P>
<P>Her con&s;iderations were interrupted by
Olivia, who&s;e manner indicated &s;omething
extraordinary; the u&s;ual tranquillity of her
countenance was gone, and an air of grief
mingled with apprehen&s;ion appeared there.
Before &s;he &s;poke, &s;he examined the pa&s;&s;age
and looked round the cell. &startq;It is as I
<PB N="329" REF="342">
feared,&endq; &s;aid me abruptly; &startq;my &s;u&s;picions
are ju&s;tified, and you, my child, are &s;acri|ficed,
unle&s;s it were po&s;&s;ible for you to quit
the convent this night.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is it that you mean?&endq; &s;aid the
alarmed Ellena.</P>
<P>&startq;I have ju&s;t learned,&endq; re&s;umed the nun,
&startq;that your conduct this morning, which is
under&s;tood to have thrown a premeditated
in&s;ult upon the abbe&s;s, is to be puni&s;hed
with what they <HI>call</HI> impri&s;onment; alas!
why &s;hould I &s;often the truth,&mdash;with what
I believe is death it&s;elf, for who ever re|turned
alive from that hideous chamber!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With death!&endq; &s;aid Ellena, agha&s;t;
&startq;Oh, heavens! how have I de&s;erved
death?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That is not the que&s;tion, my daughter,
but how you may avoid it. Within the
deepe&s;t rece&s;&s;es of our convent, is a &s;tone
chamber, &s;ecured by doors of iron, to
which &s;uch of the &s;i&s;terhood as have been
guilty of any heinous offence have, from
<PB N="330" REF="343">
time to time, been con&s;igned. This con|demnation
admits of no reprieve; the un|fortunate
captive is left to langui&s;h in chains
and darkne&s;s, receiving only an allowance
of bread and water ju&s;t &s;ufficient to pro|long
her &s;ufferings, till nature, at length,
&s;inking under their intolerable pre&s;&s;ure,
obtains refuge in death. Our records re|late
&s;everal in&s;tances of &s;uch horrible puni&s;h|ment,
which has generally been in&s;licted
upon nuns, who, weary of the life which
they have cho&s;en under the fir&s;t delu&s;ions
of the imagination, or which they have been
compelled to accept by the rigour or ava|rice
of parents, have been detected in e&s;cap|ing
from the convent.&endq;</P>
<P>The nun pau&s;ed, but Ellena remaining
wrapt in &s;ilent thought, &s;he re&s;umed: &startq;One
mi&s;erable in&s;tance of this &s;everity has oc|curred
within my memory. I &s;aw the
wretched victim enter that apartment&mdash;never
more to quit it alive! I &s;aw, al&s;o,
her poor remains laid at re&s;t in the convent
<PB N="331" REF="344">
garden! During nearly two years &s;he lan|gui&s;hed
upon a bed of &s;traw, denied even
the poor con&s;olation of conver&s;ing through
the grate with &s;uch of the &s;i&s;ters as pitied
her; and who of us was there that did not
pity her! A &s;evere puni&s;hment was threat|ened
to tho&s;e, who &s;hould approach with
any compa&s;&s;ionate intention; thank God! I
incurred it, and I endured it, al&s;o, with &s;e|cret
triumph.&endq;</P>
<P>A gleam of &s;atisfaction pa&s;&s;ed over Oli|via's
countenance as &s;he &s;poke this; it was the
&s;weete&s;t that Ellena had ever ob&s;erved there.
With a &s;ympathetic emotion, &s;he threw her|&s;elf
on the bo&s;om of the nun, and wept;
for &s;ome moments they were both &s;ilent.
Olivia, at length &s;aid, &startq;Do you not be|lieve,
my child, that the officious and of|fended
abbe&s;s will readily &s;eize upon the
circum&s;tance of your di&s;obedience, as a pre|tence
for confining you in that fatal cham|ber?
The wi&s;hes of the Marche&s;a will thus
&s;urely be accompli&s;hed, without the diffi|culty
<PB N="332" REF="345">
of exacting your obedience to the
vows. Alas! I have received proof too
ab&s;olute of her intention, and that to-mor|row
is a&s;&s;igned as the day of your &s;acrifice;
you may, perhaps, be thankful that the
bu&s;ine&s;s of the fe&s;tival has obliged her to
defer executing the &s;entence even till to-morrow.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena replied only with a groan, as her
head &s;till drooped upon the &s;houlder of
the nun; &s;he was not now he&s;itating whether
to accept the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Vivaldi, but de|&s;ponding
le&s;t his utmo&s;t efforts for her de|liverance
&s;hould be vain.</P>
<P>Olivia, who mi&s;took the cau&s;e of her
&s;ilence, added, &startq;Other hints I could give,
which are &s;trong as they are dreadful, but
I will forbear. Tell me how it is po&s;&s;ible
I may a&s;&s;i&s;t you; I am willing to incur a
&s;econd puni&s;hment, in endeavouring to re|lieve
a &s;econd sufferer.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena's tears flowed fa&s;t at this new in|&s;tance
of the nun's genero&s;ity.&endq; But if
<PB N="333" REF="346">
they &s;hould di&s;cover you in a&s;&s;i&s;ting me to
leave the convent,&endq; &s;he &s;aid, in a voice con|vul&s;ed
by her gratitude,&mdash;&startq;O! if they
&s;hould di&s;cover you!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;I can a&s;certain the puni&s;hment,&endq; Olivia
replied with firmne&s;s, &startq;and do not fear to
meet it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How nobly generous this is!&endq; &s;aid the
weeping Ellena; &startq;I ought not to &s;uffer you
to be thus carele&s;s of your&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My conduct is not wholly di&s;intere&s;t|ed,&endq;
the nun mode&s;tly replied; &startq;for I
think I could endure any puni&s;hment with
more fortitude than the &s;ickening angui&s;h
of beholding &s;uch &s;uffering as I have wit|ne&s;&s;ed.
What are bodily pains in compa|ri&s;on
with the &s;ubtle, the exqui&s;ite tortures
of the mind! Heaven knows I can &s;upport
my own afflictions, but not the view of
tho&s;e of others when they are exce&s;&s;ive.
The in&s;truments of torture I believe I could
endure, if my &s;pirit was invigorated with
the con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of a generous purpo&s;e;
<PB N="334" REF="347">
but pity touches upon a nerve that vibrates
in&s;tantly to the heart, and &s;ubdues re&s;i&s;tance.
Yes, my child, the agony of pity is keener
than any other, except that of remor&s;e, and
even in remor&s;e, it is, perhaps, the ming|ling
unavailing pity, that points the &s;ting.
But, while I am indulging this egoti&s;m, I
am, perhaps, increa&s;ing your danger of the
&s;uffering I deprecate.&endq;</P>
<P>Ellena, thus encouraged by the generous
&s;ympathy of Olivia, mentioned Vivaldi's
purpo&s;ed vi&s;it of this evening; and con|&s;ulted
with her on the probability of
procuring admittance for her&s;elf to the
abbe&s;s's parlour. Reanimated by this
intelligence, Olivia advi&s;ed her to repair
not only to the &s;upper-room, but to attend
the previous concert, to which &s;everal
&s;trangers would be admitted, among whom
might probably be Vivaldi. When to this,
Ellena objected her dread of the abbe&s;s's
ob&s;ervation, and of the immediate &s;e$lu&s;ion
that would follow, Olivia &s;oothed her fears
<PB N="335" REF="348">
of di&s;covery, by offering her the di&s;gui&s;e
of a nun's veil, and promi&s;ing not only to
conduct her to the apartment but to afford
her every po&s;&s;ible a&s;&s;i&s;tance towards her
e&s;cape.</P>
<P>&startq;Among the crowd of nuns, who will
attend in that &s;pacious apartment,&endq; Olivia
added, &startq;it is improbable you would be
di&s;tingui&s;hed, even if the &s;i&s;ters were le&s;s
occupied by amu&s;ement, and the abbe&s;s
were at lei&s;ure to &s;crutinize. As it is, you
will hazard little danger of di&s;covery; the
Superior, if &s;he thinks of you at all, will
believe that you are &s;till a pri&s;oner in your
cell, but this is an evening of too much im|portance
to her vanity, for any con&s;idera|tion,
di&s;tinct from that emotion, to divide
her attention. Let hope, therefore, &s;upport
you, my child, and do you prepare a few
lines to acquaint Vivaldi with your con&s;ent
to his propo&s;al, and with the urgency of
your circum&s;tances; you may, perhaps,
<PB N="336" REF="349">
find an opportunity of conveying them
through the grate.&endq;</P>
<P>They were &s;till conver&s;ing on this &s;ub|ject,
when a particular chime founded,
which Olivia &s;aid &s;ummoned the nuns to
the concert-room; and &s;he immediately
ha&s;tened for a black veil, while Ellena
wrote the few lines that were nece&s;&s;ary for
Vivaldi.</P>
