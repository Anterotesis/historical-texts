<HEAD>THE
EARL OF DOUGLAS,
AN
ENGLISH STORY.</HEAD>
<P>NOTHING could equal
his a&s;toni&s;hment and joy at hear|ing
his <HI>Julia,</HI> &s;o long lamented,
was &s;till alive;&mdash;that &s;he had
been educated in his own reli|gion,
and was one of the mo&s;t
accompli&s;hed works of nature.&mdash;
The ardency of his de&s;ire to be|hold
<PB N="2" REF="4">
her, would not have &s;uffer|ed
him to defer that indulgence
a moment, if he could have met
with a &s;hip bound to <HI>England,</HI>
and if he had been ma&s;ter of his
own actions. He begged <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
to give him a particular
detail of the &s;tate of government
and religion of his country,
which he complied with, enu|merating
every thing that had
happened till the acce&s;&s;ion of
Queen <HI>Mary.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER a long and &s;erious re|flection
on the various vici&s;&s;itudes
in church and &s;tate, the earl
thought it mo&s;t eligible to return
to <HI>Venice,</HI> and endeavour to reap
&s;ome reward for a long and pain|ful
captivity, the re&s;ult of his
attachment to the &s;ervice of the
republick. He had no doubt
but his daughter was in a happy
<PB N="3" REF="5">
&s;ituation with the counte&s;s of
<HI>Douglas;</HI> the generous cares be|&s;towed
on her infancy, were a
&s;ecurity to him that her future
kindne&s;s would not be le&s;s &s;ervent,
and not conceiving there could
be any exigence which required
his immediate pre&s;ence, he de|dermined
to write to his friends
in <HI>England,</HI> whil&s;t he pro&s;ecuted
his intere&s;t at <HI>Venice</HI> with all his
power.</P>
<P>HE communicated this plan
to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who was not &s;orry
he delayed his departure for
<HI>England;</HI> who knows, &s;aid he to
a gentleman in whom he ven|tured
to confide, though placed
near him by his father, who
knows but if the earl of <HI>War|wick</HI>
returned to <HI>London,</HI> my fa|mily
might pre&s;s him to di&s;po&s;e
of <HI>Julia.</HI>&mdash;The ta&s;k would be far
<PB N="4" REF="6">
more difficult to re&s;i&s;t the com|mands
of her own father than of
mine, and in my ab&s;ence, a
propo&s;al of that nature may be
attended with dreadful con&s;e|quences.
This way of thinking
led him to confirm the earl as
much as po&s;&s;ible in his re&s;olu|tion;
and from that moment,
they contracted the &s;tricte&s;t and
tendere&s;t friend&s;hip that can po&s;|&s;ibly
be imagined between two
men of exalted merit, with only
this di&s;tinction, that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
behaved to the earl with a re|&s;pectful
regard and deference,
which might have &s;urprized tho&s;e
who were ignorant of his mo|tive.
His pur&s;e was no longer
his own, but his friend's; and
he generou&s;ly regarded what he
drew from it for his own u&s;e, as
a pre&s;ent the earl be&s;towed,
<PB N="5" REF="7">
whom delicacy taught him to
con&s;ider as the proprietor.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ire of being u&s;eful to
the earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> held the
&s;orrows of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> in a &s;tate
of &s;u&s;pen&s;ion; and the charms
of his conver&s;ation, a&s;&s;waged in
&s;ome mea&s;ure the poignancy of
that grief which had hitherto
known little intermi&s;&s;ion. Af|ter
a pro&s;perous voyage they ar|rived
at <HI>Leghorn.</HI></P>
<P>HERE the captain told <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
he tru&s;ted his inte|re&s;t
in regard to the ran&s;om
of <HI>Muley,</HI> for he did not &s;u&s;pect
him to be an <HI>Engli&s;hman,</HI> and
would leave it entirely to his ma|nagement.
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> on his
&s;ide, acted with equal genero&s;ity,
by&punc; pre&s;enting him with four
hundred pi&s;toles, his mother's
<PB N="6" REF="8">
parting gift, adding that he
wi&s;hed it was in his power to en|large
the &s;um for the relea&s;e of a
man he e&s;teemed &s;o much; and
as a te&s;timony of the grateful
&s;en&s;e he entertained of the cap|tain's
civility and politene&s;s.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Leghorn Hyppolitus</HI> urged
the earl to write to <HI>Julia,</HI> who
had no occa&s;ion for entreaty to
indulge his parental tenderne&s;s
in the delightful effu&s;ions of
&s;en&s;ibility.&mdash;He wrote by the
&s;ame pacquet to Lord and Lady
<HI>Douglas,</HI> a full account of his
misfortunes and &s;ituation, and
expre&s;&s;ive of his gratitude for
their favours to his <HI>Julia.</HI>&mdash;
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> likewi&s;e added a let|ter
to his father, but he made up
a &s;eparate pacquet, directed to
the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> of which the
mo&s;t important part was a letter
<PB N="7" REF="9">
to his adored mi&s;tre&s;s. He did
not expect to hear from them till
he got to <HI>Florence,</HI> where his fa|ther
had appointed him to re|&s;ide;
and had wrote in the mo&s;t
pre&s;&s;ing manner to Senator <HI>Al|$e$ti,</HI>
conjuring him to in&s;pect
the conduct of a &s;on he &s;o ten|derly
loved. The earl and <HI>Hyp|politus,</HI>
after a &s;hort &s;tay at
<HI>Leghorn,, Lucca,</HI> and <HI>Pi&s;a,</HI> ar|rived
at <HI>Florence</HI> in the mo&s;t per|fect
harmony and friend&s;hip for
each other.</P>
<P>WHILST things were in this
&s;ituation with <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> his
<HI>Julia's</HI> health and tranquillity
were greatly interrupted;&mdash;grief
preyed on the ro&s;es of her cheeks;
&mdash;the lu&s;tre of her eyes were
faded&punc; and her per&s;on &s;o emaci|ated,
&s;he could &s;carcely be known.
Far from di&s;&s;ipating her melan|choly
<PB N="8" REF="10">
by company and diver|&s;ions,
&s;he &s;hut her&s;elf up in her
appartment, and had no mo|ments
of &s;atisfaction but tho&s;e:
&s;he pa&s;&s;ed with her dear <HI>Lucilla;</HI>
or when her good fortune brought
the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> to the ca&s;tle;
who&s;e vi&s;its were very rare, from
the fear of encrea&s;ing the &s;u&s;pi|cions
of Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI> who
had ab&s;olutely forbid <HI>Julia</HI> to
conver&s;e with him.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> after$$
being many days in extreme dan|ger,
was removed from <HI>Buck|ingham</HI>
in a litter, as &s;oon as it
was thought &s;afe for him to en|dure
the motion. The counte&s;s
his mother, had been long &s;oli|citous
to have him at her hou&s;e,
but before he left the ca&s;tle, he
reque&s;ted Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> to per|mit
him to take leave of <HI>Julia:</HI>
<PB N="9" REF="11">
this was a favour not to be ob|tained.
She re&s;olutely refu&s;ed to
grant &s;uch a mark of complai|&s;ance
to the entreaties of the fa|mily,
and de&s;ired them to con|duct
her to a <HI>French</HI> convent, as
&s;he was determined upon a reli|gious
life. But they gave no cre|dit
to her a&s;&s;ertions, and did not
doubt, &s;hould they comply with
her de&s;ire, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> would find
&s;ome method to &s;ee her, and o|verturn
all the precautions they
had taken to prevent any farther
intercour&s;e. Sometimes under
the pretext of affection, and
&s;ometimes by a formal refu&s;al,
they apparently di&s;covered their
determination was that &s;he mu&s;t
either remain in confinement, or
marry to be free.</P>
<P>A PROCEEDING &s;o rigorous,
renewed all her afflictions.&mdash;I
am then a &s;lave, my dear <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
<PB N="10" REF="12">
&s;aid &s;he, I am even refu&s;ed per|mi&s;&s;ion
to fly to a convent! to
enjoy the liberty of indulging my
ju&s;t grief! I am to live in per|petual
re&s;traint;&mdash;obliged to
controul the motions of my heart
&mdash;of my countenance;&mdash;&s;ur|rounded
by per&s;ons who&s;e pre|&s;ence
importunes and di&s;tre&s;&s;es
me! Alas! to what can I be
re&s;erved! I who am a &s;ingular
in&s;tance of being refu&s;ed devo|voting
my&s;elf to <HI>God!</HI> Who
ever oppo&s;ed a religious vocati|on?
Nay, how many wretched
beings are forced into convents
again&s;t their inclinations?&mdash;
For me alone, all rules are re|ver&s;ed!
&mdash;My misfortunes &s;eem
to rejoice the authors of them!
The&s;e contending pa&s;&s;ions in|jured
both body and mind.&mdash;
Re&s;entment frequently got the
better of her natural &s;weetne&s;s of
<PB N="11" REF="13">
temper; whil&s;t <HI>Lucilla,</HI> gave her
the only&punc; comfort in her power,
by partaking her grief. Equal|ly
&s;en&s;ible and prudent, &s;he col|lected
all the arguments that
could tend to appea&s;e her, and
was a&s;&s;iduous in painting future
pro&s;pects of ble&s;&s;ings capable of
giving her plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS, in the mean
time, waited on Senator <HI>Alberti,</HI>
whom he found exceedingly di&s;|po&s;ed
to fulfil Lord <HI>Douglas's</HI>
mo&s;t &s;anguine expectations.&mdash;
A few days after, he invited him
and the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> to <HI>Ca|jan&eacute;,</HI>
a &s;eat built by <HI>Lorenzo de
Medicis,</HI> where was a&s;&s;embled all
that ta&s;te and magnificence could
collect of curious and beautiful.
<HI>Co&s;mo,</HI> the reigning duke, was
gone to pa&s;s &s;ome time there.&mdash;
He expre&s;&s;ed great concern that
<PB N="12" REF="14">
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI>$ could not
&s;tay longer in his dominions, and
received <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> in a manner
capable of flattering his ambi|tion,
and of affording him a &s;en|&s;ible
joy, if his mind would
have &s;uffered him to reli&s;h any
thing but affection. His &s;adne&s;s
a mazed the court;&mdash;he per|ceived
it, but not being able to
conceal it, he entreated <HI>Alberti</HI>
to &s;horten the vi&s;it.</P>
<P>THE earl and counte&s;s of <HI>Doug|las</HI>
were not under equal inquie|tude;
the &s;o much wi&s;hed for re|moval
of their &s;on, allowed them
that repo&s;e of which they had
been &s;o long deprived; their
principal anxiety now, was to
gain the ab&s;olute direction of the
mutual corre&s;pondence of the
lovers. The morning <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
left <HI>England,</HI> indulged him with
<PB N="13" REF="15">
a parting farewell, le&s;s to com|po&s;e
his mind by that con&s;ola|tion&punc;
than as a means of di&s;co|vering
how this corre&s;pondence
was to be regulated, To attain
that knowledge, the counte&s;s or|dered
one of her women to con|ceal
her&s;elf behind a door, only
covered with the tape&s;try of the
room, where &s;he might hear and
&s;ee all that pa&s;&s;ed. From her
they learned the letters were to
be addre&s;&s;ed to the earl of <HI>Su&s;|&s;ex.</HI>
The difficulty was how to
intercept them, a thing not ab|&s;olutely
impracticable, where cu|rio&s;ity
is powerful, and no ex|pence
&s;pared for its gratification.</P>
<P>Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> gained over the
ma&s;ter of the pacquet, that
brought the foreign mails, and
was certain by his means to
receive all letters from <HI>Italy</HI> di|rected
to the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI> On
<PB N="14" REF="16">
the other &s;ide, he had recour&s;e
to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> envoy, his inti|mate
friend, to try all methods
of rendering him&s;elf ma&s;ter of
the letters directed to his &s;on.&mdash;
He informed him in general, of
his falling in love with a young
woman of no fortune; and that
he had &s;ent him abroad in hopes
of curing his pa&s;&s;ion, for which
purpo&s;e, he &s;hould put in prac|tice
all the &s;tratagems he could
invent, to recall him to duty.&mdash;
He conjured the envoy to a&s;&s;i&s;t
his de&s;igns, as the happine&s;s of
his &s;on depended on it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t pacquet Lord <HI>Doug|las</HI>
received at <HI>London,</HI> was from
<HI>Leghorn,</HI> containing letters from
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> and <HI>Hyppo|litus,</HI>
with the a&s;toni&s;hing news
of the earl's providential e&s;cape,
a fact not to be doubted when
<PB N="15" REF="17">
atte&s;ted under his own hand.&mdash;
He did not think it proper <HI>Julia</HI>
&s;hould be informed of this happy
event. It will arm her with
weapons to oppo&s;e us, &s;aid he to
the counte&s;s, when we recom|mend
any advantageous match,
the natural excu&s;e will be, &s;he
mu&s;t now wait the return and
approbation of her father! And
as the earl mentions with warmth
his recent obligations to <HI>Hyppo|litus,</HI>
who probably has made
him&punc; the confident of his pa&s;&s;ion
for <HI>Julia,</HI> he will hardly be per|&s;waded
to act again&s;t the inclina|tion
of the friend he loves.</P>
<P>AFTER communicating the&s;e
reflexions, they agreed it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to keep the &s;ecret from
<HI>Julia,</HI> and to employ every art
to intercept the corre&s;pondence
of the&s;e tender and unfortunate
<PB N="16" REF="18">
lovers. Accordingly, the con|cealed
the pacquet to the earl of
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> and &s;orged letters to him,
to <HI>Julia,</HI> and <HI>Lucilla,</HI>&mdash;In that
to the earl, he tells him of being
wounded in his right hand, in
an engagement at &s;ea, which o|bliges
him to employ a friend to
write; a fallacy to accu&s;tom
them from the fir&s;t to a different
hand writing; and as a farther
impo&s;ition on their credulity,
the &s;tyle of a faithful ab&s;ent lo|ver
was imitated to the utmo&s;t
perfection.</P>
<P>THEY likewi&s;e an&s;wered the
real letters from <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> in
terms the mo&s;t likely to con|vince
him there was no decep|tion,
and to remove all &s;u&s;|picion
from the difference of
character, they told him they had
all agreed to vary their writing,
le&s;t, by any accident, their let|ters
<PB N="17" REF="19">
might fall into other hands,
who would then remain igno|rant
of the authors.</P>
<P>THIS plan occa&s;ioned a &s;e|cond
letter to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> envoy,
to entreat him to intercept the let|ters
directed to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> unle&s;s
&s;ealed with &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion
as he &s;ent him a copy of. Tho&s;e
&s;o &s;ealed were to be delivered to
his &s;on, and all others returned
under cover, to the earl of <HI>Doug|las.</HI>
Thus ma&s;ter of the corre&s;|pondence,
his dexterity was &s;olely
employed in directing it to the
point he intended. An air of
coldne&s;s was in&s;en&s;ibly diffu&s;ed
on both &s;ides. <HI>Julia</HI> was wretch|ed.
&mdash;Ah my &s;i&s;ter! &s;aid &s;he
to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> your brother's pa&s;&s;ion
no longer exi&s;ts! ob&s;erve with
what indifference he writes!&mdash;
he lets &s;everal mails arrive with|out
<PB N="18" REF="20">
any news of him;&mdash;and
when he does let me hear from
him, there is &s;uch an apparent
con&s;traint in his &s;tyle, as &s;hews
his profe&s;&s;ions of friend&s;hip and
remembrance, are rather the dic|tates
of civility and politene&s;s,
than the voluntary effu&s;ions of
the heart: he is no more the
&s;ame <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> my &s;i&s;ter! con|tinued
&s;he; alas, he is changed
indeed! After the&s;e moments
of agony, &s;he would &s;ink into
a &s;tate of &s;tupefaction that had
&s;omething horrid in it. <HI>Lucilla</HI>
exerted her utmo&s;t eloquence
to ju&s;tify her brother's integrity
and con&s;tancy, though &s;he was
convinced her&s;elf of his infide|lity,
and was greatly hurt by the
levity of his conduct.</P>
<P>WHILST the&s;e amiable friends
pa&s;&s;ed their nights in angui&s;h,
<PB N="19" REF="21">
and wrote a thou&s;and reproachful
upbraiding letters to the unfor|tunate
<HI>Hyppolitus:</HI> he was not
in a more tranquil &s;ituation than
them&s;elves. Before the earl of
<HI>Warwick</HI> left <HI>Venice,</HI> he recounted
to him all that had happened at
the ca&s;tle, and engaged him to
acquie&s;ce in his &s;entiments, and
to promi&s;e his beautiful daughter
&s;hould be only his.</P>
<P>VAIN&punc; was it that he de&s;cribed
his tran&s;ports to his charming
mi&s;tre&s;s, when they hid e|very
thing&punc; from her eyes, but
words that penetrated her &s;oul
with grief! And <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> re|ceived
replies where formality
and di&s;tru&s;t were blended, &s;o e|vidently
as to occa&s;ion him the
mo&s;t cruel alarms.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="22">
I HAVE already taken notice
that he met with a thou&s;and
marks of con&s;ideration and re|&s;pect
from the &s;en$tor <HI>Alberti,</HI>
who had a &s;on about the &s;ame
age with <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who&s;e name
was <HI>Leander:</HI> he was hand&s;ome,
agreeable, had wit, politene&s;s,
and the mo&s;t gentle and engaging
behaviour. The&s;e two cavaliers
felt an immediate propen&s;ity to
contract a friend&s;hip. There
was &s;uch an agreement of hu|mour
and di&s;po&s;ition between
them, that at fir&s;t &s;ight, &s;ympa|thy
acted powerfully, and time
formed &s;o complete a union, that
they concealed nothing from
each other, but communicated
their mo&s;t &s;ecret thoughts and
reflexions. It may be naturally
concluded, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> made <HI>Le|ander</HI>
a circum&s;tantial recital of
his pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Julia.</HI>&mdash;He &s;poke
<PB N="21" REF="23">
of her in terms &s;o rapturous as
were enough to kindle a flame in
the brea&s;t of his friend.&mdash;He ex|patiated
with all the extrava|gance
of an enamoured heart, on
the charms and perfections of
his mi&s;tre&s;s: never was beauty,
he exclaimed, &s;oftened with
&s;weetne&s;s and delicacy like her's!
with an under&s;tanding &s;o inform|ed
&mdash;&s;o refined! and a &s;oul &s;ub|lime,
Yet tender! In &s;hort,
&s;he is all enchanting excellence!
How fortunate are you, my dear
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Leander,</HI> in the
affection of a woman &s;o accom|pli&s;hed!
&mdash;For my part, I have
not yet ta&s;ted the plea&s;ures of a
tender engagement.&mdash;The wo|men
here are all coquets,&mdash;who
encourage univer&s;al addre&s;&s;es,&mdash;
and are un&s;u&s;ceptible of love,
yet are cruel to none.&mdash;Ah!
what dangerous &s;yrens! replied
<PB N="22" REF="24">
<HI>Hyppolitus;</HI> I loved <HI>Julia</HI> before
I was &s;en&s;ible of itmy&s;elf,&mdash;
and &s;he has been the only object
of my attachment;&mdash;it is not
therefore from experience that I
regard women of that cla&s;s in a
formidable light, but I confe&s;s
to you their in&s;en&s;ibility of heart,
and inequality of humour, with
that unbounded fondne&s;s for ad|miration,
makes me extremely
concerned for tho&s;e who are en|tangled
in their &s;nares. At the
conclu&s;ion of &s;uch conver&s;ations
he would unfa&s;ten the bracelet of
<HI>Julia's</HI> hair, and imprint on it
a thou&s;and ki&s;&s;es of tenderne&s;s!
he would expect the day of the
courier's arrival with inconceiv|able
impatience. The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI>
envoy never neglected to &s;erve
his friend, Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI> with
great punctuality; &s;o that <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
regularly received the
<PB N="23" REF="25">
counterfeit letters, in&s;tead of the
true, and his inquietude aug|mented
in proportion to the cold|ne&s;s
of the &s;entiments he read,
which the feelings of his own
heart &s;o little de&s;erved: Shall I
tell you the fatal effects of ab|&s;ence?
&s;aid he to <HI>Leander,</HI> &s;or|rowfully,
the more mine is
lengthened, the more <HI>Julia's</HI> in|difference
encrea&s;es. Ah! too
cruel ab&s;ence that effaces my
image in the heart I love!</P>
<P>LEANDER endeavoured to pre|vail
with his friend to re&s;ide &s;ome
time at <HI>Rome</HI> and <HI>Venice.</HI> No,
&s;aid <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> let me remain
here; it is indifferent to my fa|ther
where I am, if I am not in
<HI>England:</HI> and <HI>Florence</HI> is rather
le&s;s di&s;tant from it than the cities
you mention. I am in&s;en&s;ible to
all the beauties of art and nature,
<PB N="24" REF="26">
till I am re&s;tored to the &s;ight of
her who excells them all! no o|ther

me&mdash;All my pa&s;&s;ions are
ab&s;orbed in the love I feel for
that amiable woman.&mdash;I am
lo&s;t to every thing but grief!
Notwith&s;tanding the con&s;tancy
of my adoration, you &s;ee my
friend, &s;he kills me with her
congealing expre&s;&s;ions. And for
that rea&s;on, replied <HI>Leander,</HI> I
am de&s;irous to divert you for a|while
from the indulgence of that
black melancholy which induces
you to &s;hun &s;ociety.&mdash;I ought no
longer to conceal from you, that
the court regards you as a mere
mi&s;anthorpe.&mdash;Every one en|quires
the rea&s;on.&mdash;The ladies
are very clamorous in their in|vectives;
&mdash;at lea&s;t my <HI>Hyppo|litus,</HI>

<PB N="25" REF="27">
&s;aid he, it is neither in my power
or inclination to act otherwi&s;e
than I do! Let me, my dear
<HI>Leander,</HI> let me enjoy the liberty
of complaining. Seek not to
re&s;train my &s;orrows, to mourn
unmole&s;ted, is an advantage few
people will choo&s;e to envy me!</P>
<P>A YEAR had been dragged
on in this manner, and Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> congratulated him&s;elf on
the &s;ucce&s;s of his mea&s;ures.&mdash;
But he could not avoid ob&s;erving
with peculiar vexation, in all the
letters he opened, that ab&s;ence
had wrought no effect on the
hearts of <HI>Julia&punc;</HI> and <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>
That their affection was to &s;trong
to be weakened by time; and
that every line was expre&s;&s;ive of
an inviolable faith capable of
re&s;i&s;ting death it&s;elf. The ap|prehen&s;ion
that &s;ome unfore&s;een
<PB N="26" REF="28">
accident might de&s;troy the de|&s;ign
he had been &s;o a&s;&s;iduous in
labouring to complete, induced
the earl, without delay, to vi&s;it
the <HI>Florentine</HI> amba&s;&s;ador, and
explain to him the unea&s;ine&s;s he
&s;uffered, from his &s;on's per|&s;everance
in an attachment that
neither his commands, nor ab|&s;ence,
had made the lea&s;t im|pre&s;&s;ion
upon. He then reque&s;t|ed
his a&s;&s;i&s;tance in a &s;cheme he
would communicate. The am|ba&s;&s;ador
expre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf ready
to oblige him,&mdash;and joined in
the compo&s;ition of letters from
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> en|voy,
the Marqui&s;s <HI>de Neri,</HI> and
the Senator <HI>Alberti.</HI> The pur|port
of the fir&s;t was to a&s;k his
father's con&s;ent to a marriage
with <HI>Signiora de Neri,</HI> a girl of
quality, allied to &s;everal of the
fir&s;t and mo&s;t illu&s;trious families
<PB N="27" REF="29">
in <HI>Italy,</HI> and from whom, as
heire&s;s, &s;he had great expecta|tions.</P>
<P>THIS was accompanied with
her picture, which being a fan|cied
production, the painter's
imagination was left at liberty to
make as beautiful as he plea&s;ed;
&mdash;and indeed, it might be con|&s;idered
as the very model of per|fection.
The Senator <HI>Alberti</HI>
wrote in po&s;itive terms to Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> that his &s;on was &s;o di&s;|tractedly
in love with the lady,
a refu&s;al might co&s;t him his life.
The <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> envoy informed his
lord&s;hip that he was perfectly
convinced of the great advantages
to be expected from an alliance
with <HI>Signiora de Neri,</HI> The mar|qui&s;s
of <HI>Neri's</HI> letter was in the
polite&s;t &s;train, acquainting him
in a carele&s;s way, of his daugh|ter's
<PB N="28" REF="30">
preference for <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
in return for his &s;trong attach|ment
he had profe&s;&s;ed; and that
he could not re&s;i&s;t their united
importunities to mention the
&s;ubject to him; and a&s;&s;ure him he
&s;hould feel a &s;ingular joy in ac|cepting
the honour of &s;uch a
connection, if he was &s;o happy
as to find it equally agreeable to
the earl of <HI>Douglas.</HI></P>
<P>THINGS thus concerted, one
day when Lord <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> was at din|ner
with the family, a me&s;&s;age
from the <HI>Florentine</HI> amba&s;&s;ador,
de&s;iring leave to wait on the earl
of <HI>Douglas</HI> was delivered. He
politely de&s;ired the amba&s;&s;ador to
fix his own time, and &s;hould ex|pect
the honor he intended him
with impatience. Pre&s;ently af|ter
his name was announced,
when <HI>Julia,</HI> who avoided all
<PB N="29" REF="31">
&s;trangers, ro&s;e up to retire; but
as the &s;cene was de&s;igned for her
ob&s;ervation, the counte&s;s whi&s;|pered
her, that it would not be
well-bred for <HI>Lucilla</HI> and her to
leave the room the time &s;he &s;tayed.
When the fir&s;t compliments
were over, the amba&s;&s;ador told
his lord&s;hip he wi&s;hed to con|ver&s;e
with him on an affair of
con&s;equence, relating to <HI>Hyppo|litus.</HI>
My lord de&s;ired he would
&s;peak without re&s;erve, as there
were none pre&s;ent but his wife,
daughters, and his &s;on's mo&s;t in|timate
friend. The emba&s;&s;ador,
who played his part extremely
well, pre&s;ented him the pacquet,
which Lord <HI>Douglas</HI> fir&s;t run o|ver
to him&s;elf, when rai&s;ing his
voice, This is not an affair,
madam, &s;aid he to the counte&s;$,
that requires &s;ecrecy! Here is
what they write to me, (begin|ning
<PB N="30" REF="32">
to read aloud) when
&s;pying the box that contained
the picture, he opened it, and
appeared &s;truck with its extreme
beauty.&mdash;The counte&s;s was
charmed;&mdash;and the amba&s;&s;ador
was lavi&s;h in a&s;&s;urances that the
&s;oul of <HI>Signiora de Neri,</HI> was e|qual
to her per&s;on. He entreat|ed
his lord&s;hip to favor the pa&s;|&s;ion
of two lovers who&s;e affec|tion
was &s;o &s;incere and ardent,
and not to retard the completion
of their felicity. O <HI>Heavens!</HI>
who can de&s;cribe the feelings of
the wretched <HI>Julia</HI> during this
cruel conver&s;ation! She made
a violent effort on her heart, by
taking the picture; but in ca&s;t|ing
her eyes upon tho&s;e charms,
fatal to her repo&s;e, her rival's
beauty appeared &s;o &s;uperior,&mdash;
and grief a&s;&s;aulted her &s;o power|fully,
that the picture dropped
<PB N="31" REF="33">
from her hand.&mdash;Pale-faint mo|tionle&s;s
&s;he &s;unk on the floor!
At &s;o &s;ad a &s;pectacle, per&s;ons of
le&s;s obduracy than the earl and
counte&s;s of <HI>Douglas,</HI> mu&s;t have
been touched with compa&s;&s;ion!
They did not &s;eem the lea&s;t
moved, but ordered her to be
carried to her chamber, where
<HI>Lucilla</HI> and the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI>
bathed her face with their tears;
and notwith&s;tanding all the ap|plications
u&s;ed to recover her, it
was four hours before &s;he could
be &s;aid to live.</P>
<P>JULIA at length opened her
eyes, with a look of fixed amaze|ment.
&mdash;Neither words or tears
found a pa&s;&s;age.&mdash;She clo&s;ed
them again, and continued &s;ilent.
Said <HI>Lucilla,</HI> tenderly embracing
her, do not con&s;ider this as an ir|remediable
misfortune?&mdash;<HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
<PB N="32" REF="34">
is not married;&mdash;he may
repent his incon&s;tancy,&mdash;&s;hould
he return to a &s;en&s;e of honour,
how is it po&s;&s;ible he can abandon
you? And if he remains in|&s;en&s;ible,
will you die for an un|grateful
man, and leave me a
prey to de&s;pair and grief?</P>
<P>THE earl joined his arguments
and entreaties to tho&s;e of <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
but <HI>Julia</HI> did not di&s;cover the
&s;malle&s;t &s;ign that they made the
lea&s;t impre&s;&s;ion, and as it grew
late, the earl found him&s;elf o|bliged
to leave her without the
&s;atisfaction of hearing her &s;peak.
<HI>Lucilla</HI> watched by her all night
in tears.&mdash;The earl returned in
the morning;&mdash;he learned from
<HI>Lucilla</HI> that her friend had not
been prevailed with to take the
lea&s;t &s;u&s;tenance, and deaf to all
interce&s;&s;ion, would not deign to
<PB N="33" REF="35">
open her eyes, or utter a &s;ylla|ble.
He went immediately to
Lord and Dady <HI>Douglas,</HI> who
expre&s;&s;ed neither &s;urprize nor
&s;orrow at his pathetic de&s;cription
of the effects of her de&s;pair:&mdash;
coldly an&s;wering hunger would,
undoubtedly, in time oblige her
to eat; and that lovers had le&s;s
appetites than other people&mdash;
What, &s;aid the earl, in a fierce
and angry tone, do you add in|&s;ults
to the afflictions you have
brought upon this lovely girl?
can you think a conduct &s;o oppo|&s;ite
to humanity and ju&s;tice will
not &s;ome time or other, &s;pread
your face with blu&s;hes? He ad|ded
&s;olicitations to their re|proaches,
both equally ineffica|cious,
and returned to the ap|partment
of <HI>Julia</HI> in the deepe&s;t
di&s;tre&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="36">
HE then joined <HI>Lucilla's</HI> re|peated
reque&s;ts that &s;he would
take &s;ome food, when opening
her langui&s;hing eyes, &s;he &s;poke
the&s;e words, in a voice broken
with &s;ighs and groans:</P>
<P>&startq;MY dear &s;i&s;ter, and you my
generous friend, cea&s;e to per|&s;wade
me to take any refre&s;h|ment.
I am infinitely obliged
to you for the&s;e proofs of ten|der
&s;olicitude; but I hope very
&s;oon to arrive at the la&s;t &s;cene of
a wretched exi&s;tence.&mdash;Ah! bar|barous
<HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> (&s;he exclaim|ed)
inhuman! How have I de|&s;erved
from thy hand, &s;uch cruel
treatment?&mdash;Where are the
vows and oaths thou wert once
&s;o lavi&s;h of! No! thou never
could&s;t love! And am I &s;o weak
and mean-&s;pirited to afflict my|&s;elf
thus for a faithle&s;s betrayer?&endq;
<PB N="35" REF="37">
Here the vehemence of her ex|pre&s;&s;ion
exhau&s;ted her &s;trength;
&s;he per&s;evered in &s;ilence and ab|&s;tinence,
declining to take the
lea&s;t re&s;torative.</P>
<P>Two days fa&s;ting, had reduced
her extremely low, and the earl
of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Lucilla,</HI> too plainly
convinced of her intention, found
it expedient to alarm her on the
&s;ide of con&s;cience.&mdash;They knew
the tenderne&s;s and delicacy of her
&s;cruples, where religion was
concerned, and after acquainting
her confe&s;&s;or with the &s;ituation
of her mind, they left him to
admoni&s;h her. His authority
had greater influence than all the
tears of <HI>Lucilla,</HI> or the &s;upplica|tions
of the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex. Julia</HI>
promi&s;ed to be obedient to the
injunctions of a man whom &s;he
had always con&s;idered with reve|rence;
<PB N="36" REF="38">
and when he was gone,
&s;he begged her friends would not
condemn her too unkindly for &s;o
ob&s;tinately refu&s;ing to comply
with their reque&s;t: a&s;&s;uring them
it did not ari&s;e from any defect
in friend&s;hip, but was entirely
the work of de&s;pair. I am now
convinced it is not permitted me
to &s;horten the term of life allot|ted
by the &s;upreme <HI>Being,</HI> who
will one day demand a &s;trict ac|count
of my actions. I mu&s;t
live&mdash;continued &s;he, I mu&s;t live
to be exqui&s;itely mi&s;erable! But
&s;ince to drag on a wretched life
is injoyned me, I would wi&s;h to
conceal from the ungreatful <HI>Hyp|politus,</HI>
the poignancy of the an|gui&s;h
his perfidy has occa&s;ioned.
&mdash;Ah! &s;i&s;ter, if I may flatter
my&s;elf with the thought of being
dear to you! give me a proof of
it by never naming me more to
<PB N="37" REF="39">
your cruel brother? Or, if that
cannot be di&s;pen&s;ed with, tell
him I &s;corned to &s;hew any marks
of affliction at the news of his
infidelity.&mdash;That indifference
has &s;ucceeded to di&s;dain, and
that the name of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> is
bani&s;hed from my lips! I have
the &s;ame favour to a&s;k of you,
&s;ir, turning to the earl, do not
expo&s;e my mortal wounds to
publick view.&mdash;I confide in
your honour.&mdash;May I hope you
will not betray me? They both
promi&s;ed all &s;he de&s;ired, and
were tran&s;ported to find &s;he would
endeavour to pre&s;erve a life they
valued &s;o much.</P>
<P>SEVERAL days pa&s;&s;ed without
any remarkable occurrence&mdash;
The earl's and <HI>Lucilla's</HI> letters
were filled with the mo&s;t &s;evere
reproaches, and had he really
<PB N="38" REF="40">
been the guilty wretch they be|lieved
him, their arguments were
forcible enough to have recalled
him to his allegiance. But he
never received the&s;e any more
than the preceding ones. <HI>Julia</HI>
&s;ometimes indulged the &s;weet
hope that her lover might repent
his fal&s;hood, and not complete
the marriage. She could not
forbear telling <HI>Lucilla,</HI> that not|with&s;tanding
the unju&s;tifiable be|haviour
of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> &s;he felt
her&s;elf di&s;po&s;ed to pardon his re|turning
love.&mdash;But alas! &s;aid
&s;he, the unparalleled charms of
<HI>Signiora de Neri,</HI> bla&s;t all my
hopes that he will ever return to
me!</P>
<P>THIS reflexion plunged her
again in grief; nor did <HI>Lucilla</HI>
concur in cheri&s;hing &s;uch ill|founded
hopes, as could only
<PB N="39" REF="41">
&s;erve to renew tender emotions,
which tormented her, without a
pro&s;pect of happier events.</P>
<P>LET us try to forget <HI>Hyppoli|tus,</HI>
my dear &s;i&s;ter, &s;aid this &s;in|cere
friend, you ought to abhor
him, and though he is my bro|ther,
I am an enemy to his con|duct.
Forget,&mdash;abhor him!
Ah, <HI>Lucilla!</HI> am I mi&s;tre&s;s of
my &s;entiments? A &s;oul prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
with the &s;weet idea of lov|ing
and being beloved;&mdash;con|firmed
in it by habit;&mdash;an inge|nuous
&s;imple heart that has en|gaged
its too ea&s;y faith;&mdash;can it
be expected the&s;e &s;hould be ca|pable
of relinqui&s;hing a rooted
pa&s;&s;ion, as &s;oon as &s;u&s;picion points
at deceit?&mdash;But how &s;till more
deplorable is my de&s;tiny! con|vinced
I have for ever lo&s;t that
faithle&s;s deceiver! indu&s;trious in
<PB N="40" REF="42">
the art of &s;elf-tormenting.&mdash;
I recollect every word I heard
him &s;peak;&mdash;every thing I &s;aw
him do.&mdash;He is uncea&s;ingly
pre&s;ent before my eyes.&mdash;I
di&s;cover, and ruminate on a thou|&s;and
in&s;tances of his incompara|ble
merit.&mdash;All, all, concur to
overwhelm me with regret! with
unutterable woe!&mdash;Alas! my
deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter, nothing can ex|ceed
my unhappine&s;s! It is im|po&s;&s;ible
for you to comprehend
the angui&s;h and horror of a &s;itu|ation
you never experienced!</P>
<P>THE circum&s;tance <HI>Julia</HI> &s;o
much dreaded the confirma|tion
of, (the marriage of <HI>Hyppo|litus</HI>)
arrived at the time Lord
<HI>Douglas</HI> had ordained it &s;hould.
The fatal &s;ound drew blood from
her heart.&mdash;Yet, though &s;he
&s;ometimes &s;uffered a gleam of
<PB N="41" REF="43">
hope to &s;oothe her &s;orrows, &s;he
had expected the &s;troke that was
to confirm them for ever. See|ing
her misfortune pa&s;t remedy,
&s;he returned to her former inten|tion
of retiring to a convent,
where &s;he might langui&s;h out her
wretched days. But a &s;park of
vanity objected.&mdash;What, &s;hall
I renounce the world, &s;aid &s;he to
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> for the &s;ake of a worth|le&s;s
lover; and gratify his pride
by offering &s;uch a &s;acrifice to his
memory? No, the thought is
in&s;upportable! Co&s;t what it
may, he &s;hall not have the &s;atis|faction
of triumphing in the be|lief
of my unhappine&s;s! Since
the earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI> pa&s;&s;ion is
proof again&s;t all the rigor I have
treated him with, I will reward
his per&s;everance, and &s;acrifice my
repo&s;e to my &s;elf-love.&mdash;This
is a ra&s;h and incon&s;iderate re&s;o|lution,
<PB N="42" REF="44">
my dear <HI>Julia,</HI> inter|rupted
<HI>Lucilla,</HI> you will not &s;ure
pre&s;ent your hand to a man you
cannot love? Think of the a|larming
con&s;equences of &s;uch a
dete&s;table engagement? I com|prehend
them all, &s;aid &s;he mourn|fully,
but I al&s;o &s;ee that this &s;tep
will prevent your brother from
di&s;covering my &s;en&s;ibility, and
weakne&s;s in his favour. He
&s;hall have rea&s;on to believe my

his for me; and I plea&s;e my&s;elf

incon&s;tancy.</P>
<P>THE prayers and arguments of
<HI>Lucilla</HI> lo&s;t their efficacy on this
occa&s;ion; and as the counte&s;s of
<HI>Douglas</HI> omitted no opportunities
to inform her&s;elf of the &s;enti|ments

<PB N="43" REF="45">
found her more favourably di&s;|po&s;ed
towards the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI>
than &s;he was eager to let him

re&s;olution.&mdash;My dear daugh|ter,
&s;aid &s;he, though your re|gard
for the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> does
dot exceed that of a friend, you
have &s;o high a &s;en&s;e of virtue,
and he adores you, if I may u&s;e
the expre&s;&s;ion, to &s;uch a &s;uper|lative
degree, that gratitude and
duty will effect in his favour what
tenderne&s;s would have induced
you to be&s;tow on another.</P>
<P>JULIA li&s;tened to her in pro|found
&s;ilence, and when &s;he
thought civility obliged her to
reply, only &s;aid, &startq;That when
&s;he formed the re&s;olution of ac|cepting
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> &s;he
hoped at the &s;ame time to be ca|pable
<PB N="44" REF="46">
of fulfilling her duty.&endq;&mdash;
Orders were given with the ut|mo&s;t
diligence for the nece&s;&s;ary
preparations of this long-de&s;ired
ceremony.</P>
<P>THE fatal day arrived. <HI>Julia</HI>
was dre&s;&s;ed in a &s;ilver brocade,
with ro&s;es &s;cattered carele&s;ly o|ver
it;&mdash;her diamonds were &s;et
in the mo&s;t elegant ta&s;te, and her
fair hair adorned with flowers.
&mdash;&s;he never appeared &s;o beauti|ful!
The &s;weet langour of her
countenance;&mdash;the palene&s;s of
her complexion, gave a delicacy
that rather added to, than di|mini&s;hed
the graces of her per|&s;on.
The earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> could
&s;carce believe this unexpected
tran&s;ition from mi&s;ery to happi|ne&s;s
real! His joy was extra|vagant;
&mdash;but all his tran&s;ports,
&mdash;his love, his con&s;tancy,&mdash;
<PB N="45" REF="47">
made no impre&s;&s;ion on the heart
of <HI>Julia.</HI> The marriage was
celebrated at <HI>Buckingham:</HI> the
ball-room was crouded in the
evening with people of the fir&s;t
fa&s;hion, who all remarked the
deep melancholly of the fair vic|tim;
&s;ome attempted to divert
her with the &s;allies of their wit,
but her an&s;wers were equally
&s;hort to the gay and the &s;erious
part of the company.</P>
<P>THE earl had been that mor|ning
informed of all that related
to the birth of <HI>Julia,</HI> as it was
judged improper he &s;hould marry
her as the earl of <HI>Douglas's</HI> daugh|ter,
though he wi&s;hed that cir|cum&s;tance
&s;till to remain a &s;ecret
to the world. In&s;tead of making
their publick appearance at court.
The earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> carried his
bride into <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> where he
<PB N="46" REF="48">
had a ca&s;tle magnificient enough
to be &s;uppo&s;ed a royal re&s;idence,
rather than that of a &s;ubject.&mdash;
To the mo&s;t delightful natural
&s;ituation was united all the em|belli&s;hments
of art. Its vicinity
to the great fore&s;t in <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI>
furni&s;hed this &s;olitary retreat with
magnificent &s;hades of elms and
oaks, venerable by their anti|quity,
though within forty miles
of the capital, the interpo&s;ition
of va&s;t woods gave the appearance
of a much farther di&s;tance, nor
were the &s;eats of the nobility,
which abounded in this county,
&s;o near as to le&s;&s;en the air of re|tirement,
but di&s;per&s;ed in a man|ner
that added new beauties to
the per&s;pective of this charming
&s;cene.</P>
<P>HERE it was the unhappy
<HI>Julia</HI> accompanied&mdash;<HI>not the hu&s;|band
<PB N="47" REF="49">
of her choice!</HI> She petiti|oned
the counte&s;s to favour her
with <HI>Lucilla's</HI> company; &s;he rea|dily
complied. Who would
have &s;een without compa&s;&s;ion,
the deep melancholly that preyed
on her &s;pirits? I had no con|ception,
would &s;he &s;ay to <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
that my mi&s;ery could be greater,
&mdash;that it was po&s;&s;ible for me
to &s;uffer more than I had &s;uffer|ed.
&mdash;But alas! how am I mi&s;|taken!
Each day! each mo|ment!
heaps woe on woe upon
my wretched head! The ter|rible
con&s;traint I am obliged to
&s;upport in the pre&s;ence of a hu&s;|band
I can never love;&mdash;the &s;e|cret
reproaches;&mdash;the remor&s;e,
their never failing con&s;equence;
&mdash;the tender remembrance of a
lover too dear!&mdash;The de&s;ire of
performing the ta&s;k of duty;&mdash;
of tearing from the heart an in|clination
<PB N="48" REF="50">
it is now a crime to in|dulge.
&mdash;All the&s;e &s;en&s;ations
are &s;o painful,&mdash;&s;o exqui&s;itely
alarming,&mdash;that I &s;ometimes
dread the mo&s;t horrid effects
from my de&s;pair! Accountable
only to my&s;elf, I at lea&s;t avoid|ed
the &s;hame of blu&s;hing for the
&s;entiments of my heart! What
a wretched martyr to the&s;e &s;en|timents!
Let it not my <HI>God,</HI>
be of long duration?</P>
<P>HERE, tears bur&s;t from her
eyes in torrents.&mdash;<HI>Lucilla</HI> &s;ym|phatized
with her, but great as
her inclination was to comfort
and &s;upport her, all endeavours
were ineffectual.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> notwith|&s;tanding
the gratification of his
wi&s;hes, felt him&s;elf &s;en&s;ibly mor|tified
in knowing he was not be|loved.&mdash;
<PB N="49" REF="51">
Love, with all its blindne&s;s, is
quick and penetrating;&mdash;di&s;|tingui&s;hes
with fatal preci&s;ion
the effects of complai&s;ance, from
tho&s;e of preference. Love is
prone to flatter,&mdash;to impo&s;e on
it&s;elf.&mdash;But there is a &s;ource of
delicate delight which the heart
ta&s;tes freely of in the exchange
of mutual profe&s;&s;ions of affec|tion;
when one alone is anima|ted,
there are many wretched
moments that explain the mis|fortune,
though the heart may
continue devoted to its object.
Such was the &s;tate of the earl of
<HI>Bedford;</HI> and in the&s;e moments
of di&s;appointment, he was &s;tu|dious
to di&s;cover who could have
robbed him of the affection of
his wife.&mdash;His reflexions did
not even lead him to conjecture!
&mdash;So prudent in her behavi|our;
&mdash;&s;uch profe&s;&s;ed in difference
<PB N="50" REF="52">
for the world;&mdash;educated in re|tirement;
&mdash;he was per&s;uaded if
&s;he did not love him, that at
lea&s;t &s;he had no prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in
favour of another! And though
the certainty of the former gave
him great concern, he felt as
great con&s;olation in the belief of
the latter. I &s;hall be completely
happy in time, &s;aid he to one of
his intimate friends. <HI>Julia</HI> is at
pre&s;ent in&s;en&s;ible; but when her
heart is once &s;u&s;ceptible of ten|derne&s;s,
I doubt not her endear|ments
will be the re&s;ult of love,
as they now are of principle.</P>
<P>THREE months were already
elap&s;ed &s;ince <HI>Lucilla</HI> or the earl
of Su&s;&s;ex had wrote a &s;ingle line
to <HI>Hyppolitus;</HI> &s;o much were
they enraged at the unpardon|able
proofs they had received of
his incon&s;tancy.&mdash;The earl,
<PB N="51" REF="53">
though he boa&s;ted of never en|tering
into a &s;erious engagement
with any woman, was &s;o per|fectly
a man of honour, he had
no conception of the forfeiture
of a promi&s;e, without the for|feiture
of hone&s;ty; a way of
thinking that irritated him to
the highe&s;t pitch, again&s;t the
conduct of his friend.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Douglas,</HI> having
nothing more to apprehend, had
thanked the amba&s;&s;adors for their
punctuality in intercepting the
pacquets; and acquainted them
there was no further occa&s;ion to
give them that trouble. But
this alteration afforded no relief
to <HI>Hyppolitus;</HI> &s;ince tho&s;e he
wi&s;hed &s;o ardently to hear from
were not in a di&s;po&s;ition to re|new
the corre&s;pondence. His
di&s;tre&s;s was inconceivable.&mdash;Se|veral
<PB N="52" REF="54">
times he was upon the
point of leaving <HI>Italy,</HI> and was as
often di&s;&s;waded by the arguments
of <HI>Leander,</HI> who exerted all his
rhetoric to detain him. One
evening, when his impatience in|duced
him to &s;hun all conver&s;a|tion,
even that of his bo&s;om
friend, he left the city, and fol|lowing
for &s;ome time the cour&s;e
of the river <HI>Arno,</HI> he turned into
a winding path, leading to a
grove of orange trees, myrtles,
and acacias, which afforded a
perpetual &s;pring: he walked
&s;lowly on for &s;ome time in a
broad walk, which he at length
quitted for a more &s;eque&s;tered
part of the wood, when finding
him&s;elf at liberty to breath his
complaints without interruption,
&mdash;he poured forth the mo&s;t bit|ter
&s;ighs and cruel reflexions on
the &s;ilence of his mi&s;tre&s;s,&mdash;his
<PB N="53" REF="55">
&mdash;&s;i&s;ter,&mdash;his friend! and came
to a determined re&s;olution to de|part
immediately; when his gen|tleman,
who knew how much
his ma&s;ter &s;uffered at not hear|ing
from <HI>England,</HI> having ju&s;t re|ceived
a pacquet, ha&s;tened to find
him; he was &s;een to enter the
wood, where diligent &s;earch at
length di&s;covered him. <HI>Hyppo|litus</HI>
was in rapture to &s;ee a letter
directed by the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex.</HI>&mdash;
He opened it with precipitation,
and found the&s;e words:</P>
<P>&startq;WHATEVER re&s;olutions I
have taken to write to you no
more, I cannot help thinking
three months &s;ilence is a &s;uf|ficient

though a marriage &s;o advan|tageous

what regards your happine&s;s,
I confe&s;s my&s;elf unable to con|gratulate
you on this occa&s;ion.
I wi&s;h you had never loved
<HI>Julia,</HI> or never cea&s;ed to love
her! Her heart was pene|trated
with the mo&s;t excruci|ating
tortures.&mdash;The <HI>Flo|rentine</HI>
amba&s;&s;ador delivered
your letters with his own hand;
&s;he &s;aw the portrait of your
new mi&s;tre&s;s;&mdash;and the con|&s;equence
of the emotions &s;he
felt, almo&s;t robbed her of life!
She has &s;acrificed her&s;elf to a
&s;entiment of di&s;dain, that I
fear will be attended with re|gret
and repentance.&mdash;Not|with&s;tanding
the moderation
and indifference with which
you apparently think of her
<PB N="55" REF="57">
now, I believe you cannot hear
without indignation and con|cern,
that &s;he has con&s;ented
to be counte&s;s of <HI>Bedford.</HI>&mdash;
A title which co&s;t her &s;o many
tears, as to give her nuptials
more the appearance of a fu|neral
than a wedding. She is
in <HI>Berk&s;hire. Lucilla,</HI> is the
companion of her &s;olitude,&mdash;
whil&s;t you are &s;urrounded with
plea&s;ure and ea&s;e, the wretched
<HI>Julia</HI> is a prey to &s;orrow and
remor&s;e. Acknowledge you

my &s;ilence, or of the coldne&s;s
of my &s;tyle.&mdash;My dear <HI>Hyp|politus,</HI>
it would not become
me to appologize for either.
The &s;entiments of friend&s;hip
ought to be free and uncon|&s;trained.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="57" REF="58">
HYPPOLITUS was in the ut|mo&s;t
a&s;toni&s;hment at the begin|ning
of this incomprehen&s;ible
letter.&mdash;His marriage,&mdash;his
incon&s;tancy,&mdash;the reproaches it
was filled with! &s;till encrea&s;ed
his &s;urprize.&mdash;But when he came
to that part which mentioned
<HI>Julia's</HI> marriage with the earl of
<HI>Bedford,</HI> he fell like one thun|der&s;truck,
at the foot of a tree;
&mdash;till tempted by the &s;torm of
pa&s;&s;ion, he repeatedly drew his
&s;word with an intention to fini&s;h
all his misfortunes at one blow;
but a feeble ray of hope &s;till flat|tered
him:&mdash;have I not all ima|ginable
rea&s;on to believe they
will practi&s;e a thou&s;and artifices to
deceive me? Perhaps <HI>Julia</HI> is
not altogether convinced of the
&s;tory they would impo&s;e upon
her, and writes in this manner
to al$rm, and lead me back to
<PB N="58" REF="59">
my former vows, had I been
capable of wandering from them!
The&s;e thoughts &s;oon gave place
to others &s;till more afflicting.</P>
<P>Is &s;he then married, he ex|claimed:
Good <HI>God!</HI> and can I
hear it without dying with de&s;|pair?
<HI>Julia,</HI> adorable <HI>Julia!</HI>
how have I de&s;erved this? Why
did you &s;u&s;pect my heart could be
guilty of the blacke&s;t trea&s;on?
That heart engaged to be ever
yours by &s;o many tender ties, was
it po&s;&s;ible for it to be anothers?
Ah! you were inclined to be
faithle&s;s your&s;elf, or you never
would have believed reports pro|pagated
to undo me! He was
&s;ilent for awhile;&mdash;then repent|ing
the &s;everity of his accu&s;ati|ons,
he entreated his <HI>Julia</HI> to
pardon him, as if &s;he had been
pre&s;ent.&mdash;The&s;e pathetic en|treaties
<PB REF="60">
<PB N="59" REF="61">
treaties were accompanied with
floods of tears, and the mo&s;t pa&s;|&s;ionate
complaints.&mdash;He then
broke into dreadful imprecations,
again&s;t the ravi&s;her of his bli&s;s,
and all who had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in &s;o vile
a deception.</P>
<P>NIGHT approached, unob|&s;erved
by <HI>Hyppolitus;</HI> he had no
thoughts of leaving the wood,
but traver&s;ed it with ha&s;ty and
unequal &s;teps.&mdash;Now re&s;ting
again&s;t a tree;&mdash;now throwing
him&s;elf on the earth;&mdash;no &s;pot
afforded him a moment's relief;
&mdash;love,&mdash;fury, and de&s;pair,
tormented his &s;oul by turns &s;o
violently, that his &s;ituation bor|dered
more upon death than
life.</P>
<P>LEANDER, with whom he had
engaged to &s;pend the evening,
<PB N="61" REF="62">
began to wonder he did not come,
and upon enquiry heard from his
gentleman, he had left him in
the wood; though the &s;ea&s;on
was fine enough to invite a lover
to pa&s;s the night in &s;o agreeable
a retreat, <HI>Leander</HI> could not a|void
feeling &s;ome anxiety as it
grew late, and went him&s;elf to
&s;eek him; nor was it long before
the &s;ound of di&s;tant groans and
complaints, alarmed him, and
dreading &s;ome accident, this
faithful friend advanced with pre|cipitation
towards the place where
he heard his voice; and by the
light of the moon, &s;aw him ex|tended
on the ground, &s;eemingly
without &s;en&s;e or motion.</P>
<P>AH! my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> cried
he, you are wounded; you have
been attacked by villains!&mdash;by
robbers! <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> looking on
<PB N="62" REF="63">
him with a countenance where
de&s;pair was &s;trongly painted,
how happy &s;hould I be, &s;aid he
with a deep &s;igh, to be wounded
even to death! My misfortunes
are terrible indeed! my dear <HI>Le|ander,</HI>
I am arrived at the very
&s;ummit of mi&s;ery! I have lo&s;t
all! Good <HI>God,</HI> &s;he is irrecover|ably
lo&s;t!</P>
<P>HE could &s;ay no more, and as
<HI>Leander</HI> &s;aw an open letter by
him, and found him unwilling
to make any further di&s;covery,
he immediately concluded there
mu&s;t be &s;ome fatal contents in
it, that had thrown his friend
into this dreadful agony of di&s;|tre&s;s.
He removed &s;ome paces
from the &s;hade of the trees, in
order to read the characters; and
nothing could exceed the grief
he felt on &s;eeing the cau&s;es of
<PB N="63" REF="64">
his di&s;tre&s;s.&mdash;He returned to
the place where he left him&mdash;
but he was gone from thence
without even remembering to
have &s;een <HI>Leander,</HI> who pur&s;ued
him,&mdash;calling aloud &s;everal times
&mdash;At length, in the mo&s;t un|frequented
and di&s;tant part of the
wood, his groans and loud ex|clamations,
again informed him
where he was:&mdash;gra&s;ping his
hand, and pre&s;&s;ing him to his
bo&s;om, with all the tenderne&s;s
of friend&s;hip, he &s;aid all that
rea&s;on, under&s;tanding and af|fection
&s;ugge&s;ted in &s;uch a tryal.
He fir&s;t &s;ympathized in his ju&s;t
affliction, which he knew it was
vain to oppo&s;e;&mdash;then e&s;&s;ayed
to oppo&s;e it, in &s;ome degree, by
the flattery of hope;&mdash;and by
remon&s;trating that a mind ele|vated
and noble like his friends,
&s;hould not &s;uffer it&s;elf to be &s;ub|dued
<PB N="64" REF="65">
by the arrows of calamity,
but &s;trive to re&s;i&s;t their force.&mdash;
he then conjured him by every
thing mo&s;t dear, particularly by
her who was the only object of
his love and di&s;tre&s;s, to endea|vour
to arm his &s;oul with forti|tude;
lea&s;t the effects of the
mo&s;t con&s;tant pa&s;&s;ion, and the
mo&s;t ju&s;tifiable &s;ubject of grief
that ever man experienced, &s;hould
be con&s;trued into cowardice and
pu&s;ilanimity. He knew the
heart of his friend was &s;en&s;ible
to glory, and could not bear the
&s;lighte&s;t imputation that tarni&s;hed
it. He added that &s;ince <HI>Julia</HI>
expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch extreme repug|nance
to a marriage &s;he was un|happily
per&s;uaded to contract, it
was an indi&s;putable proof he &s;till
reigned in her heart, and there|fore
&s;ince he was &s;till beloved,
his &s;ituation was not &s;o de&s;perate
<PB N="65" REF="66">
as he painted it. Attentive to
the&s;e various rea&s;ons urged by
his friend, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> gained
fome relaxation from grief, and
ta&s;ted the con&s;olation of the
wretched, in giving vent to his
&s;orrow in words.</P>
<P>DAY began to break, when
<HI>Leander</HI> with difficulty prevailed
with him to go home, for if he
had been &s;uffered to indulge his
own inclination, he would have
remained in the wood like a man
deprived of his &s;en&s;es. <HI>Leander</HI>
would not abandon his friend at
a time when he thought his pre|&s;ence
of mo&s;t u&s;e,&mdash;watching
by his bed&s;ide, whil&s;t he &s;tarted
from broken &s;lumbers. It is ea&s;y
to conceive how much <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
was altered by the extreme per|turbation
his mind endured.&mdash;
Tho&s;e who &s;aw him could hardly
<PB N="66" REF="67">
be per&s;uaded he was not a man
beginning to recover from &s;ome
dangerous di&s;temper. But alas!
is not love the mo&s;t dangerous of
all di&s;t$mpers? $word$! how &s;e|cu$e$
&mdash;how $word$ $en&s;ive is a

plea&s;es;&mdash;the delicious poi|&s;on
in&s;inuates it&s;elf into our
veins&mdash;&s;o much the more fatal
from our un&s;u&s;pecting credulity.
&mdash;The &s;en&s;es are in con&s;piracy to
receive the artful traitor, and
are in reality the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins who
admini&s;ter the deadly draught!</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS remained &s;eve|ral
days undetermined how to
act, and incapable of pur&s;uing
any fixed re&s;olution.&mdash;After a
thou&s;and fluctuating projects, he
at length re&s;ted on the thought
of returning to <HI>London.</HI> Nei|ther
<PB N="67" REF="68">
his father's wrath, nor the
promi&s;e to the counte&s;s of <HI>Bed|ford,</HI>
he &s;hould be three years a|broad,
were capable of &s;haking
his re&s;olution, and indeed were &s;o
far from alarming him, that he
regarded them as unworthy of
reflection! And when <HI>Leander</HI>
recalled them to his remem|brance;
betrayers of my happi|ne&s;s,
(&s;aid he) they bani&s;h me
for the more ea&s;y perpetration of
their cruel purpo&s;e!&mdash;What
have I to fear? Ju&s;t <HI>Heaven!</HI>
is there a danger that can now
intimidate me?&mdash;Mi&s;ery like
mine, cannot ri&s;e higher.&mdash;The
malice of fortune has exhau&s;ted
its quiver again&s;t me.&mdash;In the
deplorable &s;tate I am reduced to,
life is the only evil left to dread!
<HI>Leander</HI> finding him &s;o &s;te$dy,
determined to accompany him&punc;
and as he was too much ab&s;orbed
<PB N="68" REF="69">
in grief to attend to the nece&s;&s;ary
preparations for his departure, or
the regulation of his affairs, took
the management of every thing,
with the kindne&s;s and diligence
of a faithful friend. The pre|tence
was an excur&s;ion to
<HI>Rome,</HI> with only one attendant
on whom they could depend.&mdash;
<HI>Leander</HI> reque&s;ted his father's
permi&s;&s;ion, and obtained it with|out
difficulty. They &s;et out for
<HI>Boulogna,</HI> but &s;tayed there only
to pay their compliments to Count
<HI>Bentivoglio,</HI> the friend of <HI>Alberti,</HI>
for whom they had letters.</P>
<P>THEY then cro&s;&s;ed the <HI>Ap|penines,</HI>
and returning &s;ecretly to
<HI>Florence&punc;</HI> kept along the moun|tains
to <HI>L$ghorn.</HI> Not finding
any ve&s;&s;el ready to &s;ail for <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
they hired one for <HI>Ma$|&s;eilles.</HI>
Two days after their
<PB N="69" REF="70">
landing they embarked for <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
after <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> had met
with &s;ome con&s;olation in a letter
from the earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> with
whom he always maintained a
con&s;tant corre&s;pondence; though
it could not be &s;o frequent as they
wi&s;hed. The earl, on his arrival
at <HI>Venice,</HI> with an intention to
renew his offers of &s;ervice to the
republick, found every thing in
profound tranquillity, and learned
that this magnificent city was
contented with being &s;pectatre&s;s
of the di&s;turbances which then
interrupted the peace of Europe.
<HI>Co&s;mo de Medicis</HI> &s;upported by
the emperor, had be&s;ieged and
taken the city of <HI>Sienna. Tu&s;|cany,
Piedmont,</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> were
engaged in war, whil&s;t the re|publick
of <HI>Venice</HI> enjoyed the
triumph of revenge for the in|&s;ults
received from <HI>Mu&s;tapha Bi|fo$$</HI>
<PB N="70" REF="71">
that cor&s;air had entered the
<HI>Adriatic</HI> with &s;everal barks, and
already pillaged and ravaged the
coa&s;t of <HI>Dalmatia,</HI> when Admi|ral
<HI>Canelli</HI> bore down upon him
with <HI>Venetian</HI> &s;quadron,&mdash;run
his ve&s;&s;els a ground, &s;eized him,
and cutting off his head, fixed it
on a &s;pear at the prow of his gal|ley.
After this &s;ucce&s;sful expe|dition&punc;
the <HI>Venetians</HI> thought only
of pre&s;erving the amity of the
neighbouring potentates; and
the earl of <HI>Warwick&punc;</HI> &s;eeing no
opportunity of &s;ignalizing his
courage, heard with joy of the
preparations making at <HI>Malta</HI> to
oppo&s;e <HI>Dragut Rais,</HI> who by or|der
of <HI>Solyman</HI> had put to &s;ea at
the head of twenty galleys.</P>
<P>THE knights, alarmed at this
formidable fleet, were indefati|gable
in putting them&s;elves in a
<PB N="71" REF="72">
&s;tate of defence, and did not even
de&s;pair of being &s;trong enough
to attack the enemy. The earl
of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who&s;e brea&s;t &s;till
glowed with re&s;entment for the
cruel indignities of his captivity,
was ravi&s;hed with &s;o glorious an
opportunity of fighting for his
religion, di&s;tingui&s;hing his valor,
and puni&s;hing a barbarian like
<HI>Dragut-Rais.</HI> With the&s;e &s;en|timents
he applied to <HI>Aloe&s;io Mon|cenigo,</HI>
doge of <HI>Venice,</HI> to grant
him a recommendation to the
grand ma&s;ter of <HI>Malta.</HI> The doge
an&s;wered his mo&s;t &s;anguine ex|pectations,
and did every thing
to demon&s;trate his own gratitude
and that of the republic, for &s;er|vices
conferred. He &s;ailed for
<HI>Malta,</HI> where he was received
with the highe&s;t re&s;pect, and
embarked with the Admiral <HI>de la
Vallette.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="72" REF="73">
THEY did all that could be
expected from the united valour
and prudence of two &s;uch great
&s;oldiers. The <HI>Malte&s;e</HI> ve&s;&s;els
had regained their port; and the
earl had informed <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> of
his return to <HI>Venice;</HI> who, on
his &s;ide, had enlarged on the ter|rible
&s;ituation of his mind on the
marriage of <HI>Julia.</HI> The earl,
penetrated with grief, an&s;wered
he would give immediate orders
for the di&s;patch of &s;ome affairs of
particular con&s;equence that de|tained
him at <HI>Venice,</HI> and would
then ha&s;ten to <HI>London</HI> to &s;natch
his daughter from the arms of
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> that the va|lidity
of the marriage contracted
without his con&s;ent, was con|te&s;tible,
and he might depend
upon the performance of the pro|mi&s;e
given, that <HI>Julia</HI> &s;hould be
only his.&mdash;This hope &s;o agree|able
<PB N="73" REF="74">
flattered the enamoured
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> that the violence of
his affliction &s;eemed &s;u&s;pended;
&mdash;and <HI>Leander</HI> did not $ail to
&s;trengthen its weight, by remind|ing
him that the daughter of a
man of the earl of <HI>Warwick's</HI>
rank and character, mu&s;t be re|&s;tored
to the authority of an in|jured
father.</P>
<P>THE weather was favourable
to the&s;e illu&s;trious travellers,
they arrived at <HI>London</HI> incognito,
and <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> dete&s;ted his fa|ther's
hou&s;e &s;o much, that he e|ven
avoided the &s;treet where it
&s;tood. He flew to the earl of
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> who received him with a
coldne&s;s that chilled his very
&s;oul. <HI>Leander,</HI> on ob&s;erving the
&s;udden effect it had upon his
friend, who &s;inking under the re|flexions
that ru&s;hed into his mind,
<PB N="74" REF="75">
could not &s;peak, and was in an
agony of grief, broke &s;ilence,
and though a &s;tranger to the earl
of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> acquainted him in few
words with the treachery that
had been practi&s;ed, the fortunate
meeting with the earl of <HI>War|wick,</HI>
and other material particu|lars.
&mdash;The earl, &s;hocked at the
recital, threw his arms round the
neck of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and pre&s;&s;ing
him to his bo&s;om, my deare&s;t
and true&s;t friend! what is this I
hear! and what redre&s;s can be
found for injuries like yours.&mdash;
You are not married in <HI>Italy!</HI>
and yet this report, fal&s;e as I am
now convinced it is, has depri|ved
you of your <HI>Julia!</HI> At that
name, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> returning from
death to life, drawing a heart|felt
&s;igh, Ah! where is &s;he, my
friend? Where is that adorable
<HI>Julia?</HI> dear as her vital blood,
<PB N="73" REF="76">
notwith&s;tanding all the misfor|tunes
her too precipitate re&s;ent|ment

She is &s;till in <HI>Berk&s;hire,</HI> &s;aid the
earl, the generous&mdash;&s;pirited <HI>Lucilla</HI>
&s;till comforts and &s;hares her &s;or|rows.
&mdash;I have been informed
&s;he has been dangerou&s;ly ill, and
that her hu&s;band's jealou&s;y is in|tolerable;
&mdash;which I can ea&s;ily
credit, for I was lately in a great
hunting party at Lord <HI>Nevil's,</HI>
who you know has a fine &s;eat
upon the &s;ore&s;t; his lord&s;hip in|vited
me with &s;everal of his
friends, to &s;pend &s;ome days
with him, and I was particularly
plea&s;ed, as thinking it would af|ford
me a favourable opportunity
to vi&s;it <HI>Julia</HI> without the appear|ance
of premeditation. The earl
of <HI>Bedford</HI> joined us in the field,
and I hinted my intention of
waiting on him;&mdash;he returned a
<PB N="74" REF="77">
civil but re&s;erved an&s;wer, that it
would be doing him great honor,
but he was very &s;eldom at home.
&mdash;You have a lady, &s;ir, who
I am very &s;ure is never deficient
in politene&s;s to your friends in
your ab&s;ence;&mdash;he reddened,
and &s;eemed di&s;concerted; but re|covering
him&s;elf as well as he
could,&mdash;That lady, &s;ir, is fond
of retirement, and very often in|di&s;po&s;ed!
This behaviour, ex|pre&s;&s;ive
enough of his meaning,
did not an&s;wer the purpo&s;e.&mdash;
I re&s;olved to venture to knock at
his door; but his orders were &s;o
punctually ob&s;erved, that the
porter always told me his lady
was a&s;leep, or not well; &s;o found
it impracticable to get a &s;ight of
either her or <HI>Lucilla.</HI> Ah! how
am I to gain admi&s;&s;ion? The
man that wounded her hu&s;band,
and whom he undoubtedly hates
<PB N="75" REF="78">
more than all the world! Un|le&s;s
you are in &s;ome very clo&s;e
di&s;gui&s;e, I have no idea it is po&s;|&s;ible,
&s;aid <HI>Leander.</HI> They con|&s;ulted
about it &s;ome time, but
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was in too great em|bara&s;&s;ment
to range his thoughts
regularly; <HI>Leander,</HI> too little ac|quainted
with the cu&s;toms of a
country, in which he was but
ju&s;t landed! &s;o that without the
earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex's</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;tance, they
had never found an expedient.</P>
<P>I HAVE a thought, &s;aid he,
which perhaps you will make
&s;omething of:&mdash;&s;uppo&s;e we
buy &s;ome toys, &s;uch as fans, gloves,
and ribbands, with other articles
the pedlars deal in, who travel
about the country? and fill a
pack, &s;uch as they u&s;ually carry;
<HI>Leander</HI> and you may put on their
dre&s;s, and go to the earl's hou&s;e,
<PB N="76" REF="79">
free from &s;u&s;picion. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
and <HI>Leander</HI> thought the &s;cheme
admirable, and the former en|treated
his friend to &s;end imme|diately
to a haberda&s;her, to fur|ni&s;h
him with an a&s;&s;ortment of
millinary trumpery.</P>
<P>ALL things being ready,&mdash;
their boxes filled, and their au|burn
hair concealed under &s;un|burnt
wigs.&mdash;The great difficulty
to both was to dive&s;t them&s;elves
of that noble air which &s;o un|happily
di&s;tingui&s;hed the man of
fa&s;hion;&mdash;in other re&s;pects they
were &s;ure of pa&s;&s;ing undi&s;co|vered.</P>
<P>IN regard to <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> he
was not only to a&s;&s;ume an un|natural
aukwardne&s;s of per&s;on,
but was obliged to add a large
black plai&s;ter over one eye to&punc;
<PB N="77" REF="80">
&s;hade the &s;ide of his face; and
give a different appearance to his
features. They $et out that very
evening on hor&s;eback, with
two tru&s;ty attendants, who car|ried
their di&s;gui&s;es.&mdash;What a
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of joy, hope, and de&s;|pair,
pa&s;&s;ed through the heart of
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> during the journey
&mdash;In what di&s;po&s;ition am I
likely to find my <HI>Julia?</HI> Will
&s;he pity me? my dear <HI>Leander,</HI>
will &s;he li&s;ten to my vows? How
violent are the emotions I feel!
how exqui&s;ite! How &s;hall I
re&s;train my tran&s;port, when I
behold her. Should her hu&s;band
be pre&s;ent &s;hall I not be irre&s;i&s;t|ably
impelled to puni&s;h in&s;tantly
the infinite wrongs he has done
me?</P>
<P>THE conver&s;ation la&s;ted till
they arrived at the &s;pot where it
<PB N="78" REF="81">
was nece&s;&s;ary to alight, and
change their habits. They
were guarded again&s;t any unex|pected
events with a pair of pock|et
pi&s;tols, which they charged
and then left their &s;ervants and
hor&s;es in the fore&s;t.</P>
<P>THE morning was advanced,
when they drew near the earl of
<HI>Bedford's</HI> &s;eat, which <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
ea&s;ily found the approach to, as he
had formerly been there; <HI>Leander</HI>
as principal, was to a&s;k and
an&s;wer all que&s;tions.&mdash;The fir&s;t
per&s;on they met was the earl
walking in the lawn before the
hou&s;e. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> &s;huddered at
the &s;ight, and could hardly con|tain
his ri&s;ing indignation within
the bounds pre&s;cribed. <HI>Leander</HI>
acco&s;ted him in <HI>Italian,</HI> which
the earl under&s;tood perfectly, and
<PB N="79" REF="82">
indeed it is a language the <HI>Eng|li&s;h</HI>
are fond of, telling him he
had a great many pretty toys,
and hoped he would be a pur|cha&s;er.
The earl ordered them
into the hall, and after he had
examined their merchandize,
found it &s;o much to his ta&s;te,
that he &s;ent to de&s;ire the coun|te&s;s
and <HI>Lucilla</HI> to come down.
The ladies pre&s;ently appeared;
<HI>Julia</HI> leaned upon a cane with
one hand, and re&s;ted on <HI>Lucilla's</HI>
arm as a &s;ick per&s;on; pale,&mdash;
emaciated,&mdash;with an air of &s;et|tled
melancholy!&mdash;But, Good
<HI>God!</HI> how beautiful did &s;he ap|pear,
thus dejected, in the eyes
of <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI> He was obliged
to re&s;t again&s;t the wall to &s;up|port
his trembling limbs.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Julia</HI> was &s;eated, &s;he
received with habitual complai|&s;ance
<PB N="80" REF="83">
but with the utmo&s;t inat|tention
the curio&s;ities <HI>Leander</HI>
pre&s;ented her! &s;he expre&s;&s;ed no
inclination for any of them, till
&s;he was &s;truck with an enameled
repre&s;entation of a &s;ick <HI>Cupid,</HI>
repul&s;ing the hand that offered
him a cordial, with this motto,
&mdash;&startq;I am pa&s;t the power of me|dicine.&endq;</P>
<P>SHE could not forbear &s;hew|ing
it to <HI>Lucilla,</HI> with a look &s;o
expre&s;&s;ive! that <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who
watched every turn of her coun|tenance,
was penetrated to the
&s;oul. Ob&s;erving the earl of
<HI>Bedford</HI> amu&s;ed in examining the
collection, and fearing <HI>Julia</HI>
&s;hould retire, he ventured to ad|vance,
after &s;earching his box
for &s;ome new toys, he carried
her &s;everal, and among&s;t them
the locket &s;he had given him
<PB N="81" REF="84">
when he left <HI>England,</HI> without
di&s;gui&s;ing his voice, which the
emotions of his &s;oul had &s;uffici|ently
altered: &startq;Buy this bracelet,
madam, &s;aid he, you, perhaps,
never &s;aw any of the kind equal
in beauty.&endq; She took it up
carele&s;ly, but the moment it met
her eye, was &s;o &s;truck, that if
the earl had ob&s;erved her at that
in&s;tant, he mu&s;t have &s;u&s;pected
&s;ome my&s;tery. After eagerly ex|amining
the colour of the hair,
&mdash;the hearts,&mdash;the device,&mdash;
where did you buy the&s;e jewels?
&s;aid &s;he in a low voice. <HI>Leander,</HI>
perceiving his friend had en|gaged
her attention, was very
fluent in conver&s;ation with the
earl;&mdash;&s;o that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> had li|berty
to reply,&mdash;Where did I
buy them madam? Alas! the&s;e
are jewels never to be bought!
In that part of my life, which
<PB N="82" REF="85">
con&s;tituted my felicity, I adored
the mo&s;t charming of her &s;ex,
and &s;he &s;uffered my adoration
without di&s;plea&s;ure.&mdash;Tho&s;e
moments pa&s;t, divine <HI>Julia,</HI> ap|proaching,
as if to poiut out the
elegance of the workman&s;hip;
tho&s;e delightful moments are
now no more! &s;he &s;u&s;pected me!
&mdash;&s;he believed me faithle&s;s,&mdash;and
I come to avow my innocence at
her feet.</P>
<P>AT the&s;e tender and affecting
words, <HI>Julia</HI> could no longer
doubt it was her dear <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>
She &s;ighed deeply, and &s;upport|ing
her head upon her hand, in|voluntary
tears trickled down
her cheeks The misfortunes of
that lady would indeed be con|&s;iderably
augmented were it true
that you are not criminal!&mdash;
Whil&s;t they were in this &s;itua|tion,
<PB N="83" REF="86">
<HI>Leander</HI> had &s;hewn the
earl a very fine dial, and in order
to judge of its excellence, had
per&s;uaded him to walk upon the
terrace.&mdash;<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> having
no other witne&s;&s;es than his &s;i&s;ter,
could no longer forbear throw|ing
him&s;elf at <HI>Julia's</HI> feet, ki&s;&s;ing
her fair hand in an extacy where
grief and joy were &s;o &s;trongly
blended, as almo&s;t to deprive
him of life. <HI>Lucilla</HI> was tran|&s;ported
at her brother's return,
and <HI>Julia</HI> was unable to &s;peak,
&s;o much was her &s;oul divided be|twixt
joy, fear, and grief.&mdash;She
even dreaded to be convinced
of his fal&s;hood, whatever incli|nation
&s;he had to reproach him;
but he prevented the latter;&mdash;
No, my amiable <HI>Julia,</HI> &s;aid he,
with the mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate emotion,
no, I am not guilty! The trea|chery
employed to impo&s;e up|on
<PB N="84" REF="87">
you, on the report of an ideal
marriage which never entered my
thoughts, has poi&s;oned the re|mainder
of my wretched days.&mdash;
I am faithful to my vows;&mdash;
<HI>Julia</HI> alas! is not &s;o to her's!
Add not to my &s;elf-reproach,
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> &s;aid &s;he in a voice
&s;tifled with &s;ighs, what I now
hear, revenges you, by inflicting
the &s;evere&s;t puni&s;hment on my
unfortunate credulity plunged
into a &s;nare too artfully &s;pread!
&mdash;Though my re&s;pect and love
will not allow me to reproach
you, yet &s;urely my deare&s;t <HI>Julia</HI>
was too precipitate in giving her|&s;elf
to another. It appears &s;he
mu&s;t have acted from other mo|tives
than tho&s;e of anger and
re&s;entment. Why did &s;he not at
lea&s;t con&s;ult her father, and wait
his approbation?&mdash;Whil&s;t he
was &s;peaking, <HI>Julia</HI> regarded him
<PB N="85" REF="88">
with looks of commi&s;eration,
concluding that di&s;appointment
had impaired his rea&s;on. &startq;Con|&s;ult
my father!&endq; Alas! &s;aid
&s;he, I do not even remember to
have had one! Were he alive,
I &s;hould not now be the wretch
I am! <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> perceiving by
the&s;e words that Lord <HI>Douglas</HI>
had &s;uppre&s;&s;ed the earl of <HI>War|wick's</HI>
letters, as well as his
own, was &s;till more enraged at
this complicated perfidy. It is
time you &s;hould be informed of
a circum&s;tance, &s;aid he, ri&s;ing
for fear of being &s;urprized, which
you are particularly intere&s;ted to
know:&mdash;Fortune, my inve|terate
enemy in all things el&s;e,
has however favoured me in the
ine&s;timable ble&s;&s;ing of your fa|ther's
life:&mdash;he lives, my <HI>Julia,</HI>
I met with him at &s;ea,&mdash;the
&s;lave of <HI>Dragut-Rais,</HI>&mdash;who was
<PB N="86" REF="89">
reported to have killed him.&mdash;I
delivered him out of his hands.
&mdash;He wrote you the particulars.
&mdash;Here <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was inter|rupted
by the entrance of the
earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> di&s;puting with
<HI>Leander</HI> on the price of the dial.
&mdash;He who &s;tudied only to de|tain
the earl, had been bartering
about it for a quarter of an hour;
he a&s;ked an extravagant price,
and abated after an ob&s;tinate per|&s;i&s;tance.
on finding the earl be|gan
to be di&s;plea&s;ed. The bar|gain
was interrupted by a vi&s;it
from Lady <HI>Nevil,</HI> &s;i&s;ter to the
earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and aunt to
<HI>Julia,</HI> though ignorant of their
con&s;anguinity; &s;he felt as &s;trong
a degree of tenderne&s;s as if &s;he
had known it.&mdash;They were
neighbours, and &s;he came to in|vite
<HI>Julia</HI> to her daughter's wed|ding,
with the fir&s;t family in
<PB N="87" REF="90">
<HI>England;</HI> though our party will
be but &s;mall&punc; &s;aid Lady <HI>Nevil,</HI> I
don't doubt its being a very chear|ful
one.&mdash;I confe&s;s, madam, re|plied
<HI>Julia,</HI> in the mo&s;t obliging
manner, that except the plea|&s;ure
I always have of &s;eeing you
and your family, I am incapa|ble
of ta&s;ting any &s;atisfaction in
company.&mdash;I need not tell you I
am but ju&s;t recovering from a
long illne&s;s, and am yet &s;o much
of an invalid, I am fearful of
being an improper gue&s;t at a
wedding.&mdash;You may alledge
what rea&s;ons you plea&s;e, &s;aid
Lady <HI>Nevil,</HI> &s;miling, but I pro|te&s;t
there can be no wedding
without you!&mdash;Every lady would
be out of &s;pirits.&mdash;I am re&s;olved
you &s;hall go home with me, this
very day! As Lord <HI>Howard</HI>
was nearly related to the earl of
<HI>Bedford,</HI> he joined his entreaties
<PB N="88" REF="91">
&s;o earne&s;tly to tho&s;e of Lady <HI>Ne|vil,</HI>
that <HI>Julia</HI> was obliged to
acquie&s;ce. There was no po&s;&s;i|bility
of &s;peaking another word
to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> or of hearing where
the earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> re&s;ided.&mdash;
<HI>Lucilla</HI> and &s;he followed Lady
<HI>Nevil</HI> out of the room, and could
only de&s;ire the pedlars not to
fail calling when they were more
at lei&s;ure, as they wanted &s;eve|ral
things.&mdash;Their eyes mu|tually
exchanged a tender adieu!
and <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and <HI>Leander</HI> de|parted
as &s;oon as they &s;aw the
ladies in the coach.</P>
<P>THEY walked on &s;ome time
in &s;ilence, each ab&s;orbed in his
own contemplations.&mdash;At length
<HI>Leander</HI> addre&s;&s;ed his friend:&mdash;
You have introduced me to the
&s;ight of two of the mo&s;t beauti|ful
women in the world; and
continued he, I believe it im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="89" REF="92">
to behold them without
admiration! I have regarded
<HI>Julia</HI> as the object of your love,
but <HI>Lucilla,</HI> the charming <HI>Lu|cilla!</HI>
is that of mine! Were
you not her brother, I &s;hould
dread you as a rival! I am en|chanted
with the engaging free|dom
of her behaviour;&mdash;the
&s;prightline&s;s of her air;&mdash;the
regular beauty of her features;
&mdash;the delicacy of her &s;hape;
&mdash;all the&s;e advantages &s;o far
tran&s;cending what I ever met
with, have thrown me into &s;uch
a&s;toni&s;hment, that I cannot for|bear
confe&s;&s;ing I never felt a real
pa&s;&s;ion for any woman till this
moment. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was &s;o de|lighted
to hear the impre&s;&s;ion
his &s;i&s;ter had made, that he &s;ud|denly
interrupted his friend's
rhap&s;ody, by throwing his arms
about his neck,&mdash;I never
<PB N="90" REF="93">
could find but one fault in you,
my dear <HI>Leander,</HI> and that was
not being in love! I &s;ometimes
lamented our di&s;&s;imilarity in that
particular; I thought it impo&s;&s;i|ble
you &s;hould li&s;ten to me with
that attention I reque&s;ted;&mdash;or
that my misfortunes could excite
your compa&s;&s;ion, when your
heart had never experienced
&s;ymphathetic feelings. In &s;hort,
I am rejoiced you have found a
woman you think worthy of a
&s;erious attachment; and, I think,
it will be my fault if my &s;i&s;ter
does not in&s;pire you with a mo&s;t
ungovernable pa&s;&s;ion! But you
have not told me what is your
opinion of the divine <HI>Julia.</HI> Is
it not with rea&s;on I die for her?
Have you ever &s;een any thing &s;o
near perfection? For my part,
I am dazzled with her beauty!
That langour! that apparent &s;ad|ne&s;s!
<PB N="91" REF="94">
added to her charms and
my affliction.&mdash;Alas! all the&s;e
circum&s;tances combined, only
encrea&s;e the &s;en&s;e I before had of
the exce&s;s of my lo&s;s.</P>
<P>CONTINUING their di&s;cour&s;e
they arrived at the &s;pot where
their attendants waited; they
had &s;carcely thrown off their di&s;|gui&s;e,
when they heard the &s;ound
of hor&s;es, and found them&s;elves
inve&s;ted by a number of arm|ed
men&mdash;Their &s;urprize
was great on being &s;ummon|ed
to &s;urrender.&mdash;Notwith|&s;tanding
the inequality of the
party, and the temerity of &s;tand|ing
on the defen&s;ive, they drew
their pi&s;tols, and put four of their
enemies to flight: availing them|&s;elves
of the trunks of &s;ome large
trees, they avoided being &s;ur|rounded,
and defended their
lives to the la&s;t &s;plinter of their
<PB N="92" REF="95">
&s;words, again&s;t their di&s;honou|rable

&s;upported them as far as they
were able, but fre&s;h recruits
poured in on the enemies &s;ide,
whil&s;t the &s;trength of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
and <HI>Leander</HI> gradually dimini&s;h|ed;
perceiving they avoided kil|ling,
and not knowing the cau&s;e
of their repeated cries to &s;ur|render,
the two friends were at
length con&s;trained to &s;ubmit.&mdash;
But no &s;ooner were the&s;e wretches
in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their per&s;ons,
than they treated them with great
inhumanity.&mdash;Re&s;entment for
the death of &s;ome of their com|rades,
and for the wounds of
others, had &s;harpened their ani|mo&s;ity
&s;o much, that they tied
their pri&s;oners together in the
roughe&s;t manner, to prevent their
e&s;cape, or farther re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P><PB N="93" REF="96">
THEY then dragged them a|long
to they hou&s;e of a neigh|bouring
ju&s;tice of peace, from
whom they had received a war|rant
for apprehending them.&mdash;
Some wood-cutters at work in
the fore&s;t, when <HI>Leander</HI> and
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> &s;tripped to change
their dre&s;&s;es, ob&s;erving them lay
a&s;ide their embroidered cloaths,
to put on the habits of pedlars,
and one of them covered his eye
with a plai&s;ter, concluded them
to be certain highwaymen, who
had lately committed &s;everal
robberies in the fore&s;t. The
con&s;tables, with &s;ome companies
of archers, were a&s;&s;embled at the
ju&s;tices, when the woodmen
went to lodge an information of
what they had &s;een: circum|&s;tances
were &s;o &s;u&s;picious, that
without much pains it was readily
believed the&s;e were the very
<PB N="94" REF="97">
rogues; planting archers in &s;i|lence
near the avenues of the fo|re&s;t,
they &s;aw the two friends
return and put on their proper
dre&s;&s;es. The con&s;tables wanted
no farther conviction, which
made them per&s;i&s;t in endeavour|ing
to take them alive, and as
night was coming on, they
thought it be&s;t to carry them be|fore
the ju&s;tice with all &s;peed.</P>
<P>UPON the road, <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
made many melancholy reflex|ions
on the oddity of this adven|ture.
&mdash;He could not conceive
what &s;hould occa&s;ion it, and was
at a lo&s;s where to fix his conjec|tures.
Can it be the con&s;e|quence
of my fathers anger?&mdash;
Am I betrayed? and has he in|formation
of my being in <HI>Eng|land?</HI>
Or can the earl of <HI>Bed|ford</HI>
and his mother, be autho|rized
<PB N="95" REF="98">
to pro&s;ecute me for break|ing
the conditions of my bani&s;h|ment?
He could recollect no
other enemies, and was amazed
what &s;hould induce them to &s;eize
<HI>Leander;</HI> he then loaded him|&s;elf
with reproaches, for the in|&s;ults
offered to his faithful friend;
much as he wanted to confer
with him on the&s;e articles, their
leaders took care to prevent it,
by keeping them in a line one
before the other.&mdash;They no
&s;ooner arrived at the ju&s;tices,
than he examined them &s;eparate|ly;
nor did their a&s;toni&s;hment
abate when he interrogated them
on murders and robberies they
had never heard of.</P>
<P>UPON their denial of the facts,
it is ea&s;y to believe the rigor of
their di&s;cipline was not relaxed;
they were put into a deep dun|geon,
<PB N="96" REF="99">
loaded with irons, and a
guard of archers placed before
the entrance. When they had
recovered liberty of &s;peech, they
&s;aid all that friend&s;hip could in|&s;pire
on &s;uch an occa&s;ion.&mdash;Do
not be unea&s;y, my dear friend,
&s;aid <HI>Leander,</HI> you &s;ee all turns
upon a mi&s;take, and the moment
you di&s;cover your&s;elf, the&s;e peo|ple
will be eager to &s;et you free.
Have I not the greate&s;t cau&s;e to
be di&s;&s;atisfied? Ah! <HI>Leander,</HI>
do you &s;o little comprehend the
&s;entiments I have for you? And
what have I not to fear from the
con&s;equences of this fatal error?
I &s;ee you fettered like a ruffian in
a gloomy dungeon! con&s;trained
to lodge upon the damp earth!
You, who generou&s;ly accompa|nied
me into my country, after
pa&s;&s;ing innumerable obligations
upon me in your's! and the fir&s;t
<PB N="97" REF="100">
place I lead you into is a pri&s;on!
This is my manner of perform|ing
the duties of ho&s;pitality!&mdash;
and you would have me in&s;en&s;i|ble
to the mortification? In|deed
I would&punc; interrupted <HI>Lean|der,</HI>
for I find very little regard
for me in this way of thinking.
From the moment I became the
voluntary partner of your afflic|tions,
my friend, all &s;elfi&s;h con|&s;iderations
were annihilated! I
&s;hould blu&s;h if I was not able to
a&s;&s;ure you my mind is &s;uperior
to accidents like this! A pri|&s;on,
&mdash;chains,&mdash;and a little abu|&s;ive
language,&mdash;are trifles, not
worth ones attention. If you
knew my heart, you would be
perfectly convinced. I &s;hould
be very unde&s;erving of the&s;e
proofs of your friendly regard,
if I could be unmoved at &s;uch
amazing genero&s;ity; but to make
<PB N="98" REF="101">
you &s;en&s;ible of the perplexity of
my &s;ituation, reflect, I intreat
you, on the con&s;equence of de|claring
my rank? When the
earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> &s;hall be informed
of the circum&s;tance of our di&s;|gui&s;e,
what will he not have rea|&s;on
to conjecture? He will
accu&s;e <HI>Julia!</HI> In the fury of his
rage, her virtue and innocence
will not guard her from &s;u&s;pi|cion!
How deplorable may be
the re&s;ult! Alas! I may be the
fatal cau&s;e of the mi&s;ery of her
I love! Can there be a more
di&s;tracting terror? My father
too,&mdash;there are are no extre|mities
of wrath he is not capa|ble
of! If he relea&s;es me from
my pre&s;ent confinement it will
be only to throw me into ano|ther,
as he has &s;o often threaten|ed!
Thus I &s;hall deprive <HI>Julia</HI>
of her hu&s;band's confidence, and
<PB N="99" REF="102">
ruin my hopes in her's.&mdash;The&s;e
are cruel effects, &s;aid <HI>Leander,</HI>
di&s;con&s;olately; and I &s;ee little
appearance how they can be a|voided.
I have thought of a
method, &s;aid <HI>Hyppolitus:</HI>&mdash;
&s;ometimes a ju&s;tice of peace may
be an intere&s;ted man! I will try,
&mdash;perhaps we may &s;ucceed.&mdash;
<HI>Leander</HI> approved his friends de|&s;ign,
and they &s;lept as well as
they were able.</P>
<P>IT was already noon when the
con&s;tables came to carry them a
&s;econd time before the ju&s;tice.&mdash;
In&s;tead of farther interrogations
as they expected, he only a&s;ked
if they had courage enough to
fight? Not able to comprehend
the meaning of the que&s;tion,&mdash;
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> replied, you may be
be&s;t informed of that from the
men who were &s;ent to attack us.
<PB N="100" REF="103">
But, continued he, advancing
nearer, and lowering his voice,
if you$ will re&s;tore our liberty,
&s;ir, you have only to pre&s;cribe
the terms:&mdash;we are ready to
agree to any &s;um you propo&s;e.&mdash;
I am not to be bribed, young
man, &s;aid the ju&s;tice, I execute
my office with integrity, and as
&s;o many per&s;ons are &s;ufferers by
your depredations, I think it ab|&s;olutely
nece&s;&s;ary you &s;hould &s;uf|fer
as an example. <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
in de&s;pair at this ill &s;ucce&s;s of
his project, after reiterated &s;oli|citations,
re&s;olved to declare who
he was. Your compliance with
our earne&s;t entreaties to relea&s;e
us, &s;aid he, could not be attend|ed
with the lea&s;t injury to your
character; I will tru&s;t you with
my name, and repeat my former
offer, if you will keep it &s;ecret,
as I have very important rea&s;ons
<PB N="101" REF="104">
for de&s;iring to be concealed.&mdash;
You &s;ee before you, <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
&s;on of the earl of <HI>Douglas.</HI>&mdash;
I would not have you relea&s;e
me, till I pay the con&s;ideration I
have promi&s;ed.&mdash;You are a
very impudent fellow, interrupt|ed
the ju&s;tice, in an angry tone,
to dare to a&s;&s;ume that name in
my pre&s;ence! when I am certain
that nobleman is now in <HI>Italy!</HI>
Saying this, he left them, and
gave orders to the con&s;tables to
be ready to march. He placed
him&s;elf at their head, and the
pri&s;oners in the mid&s;t of the
troop. When they arrived at
the brow of a hill, they &s;aw a
magnificent hou&s;e, upon the plain,
with grand avenues of fore&s;t
trees, opening on every &s;ide;&mdash;
on a terias in front, they could
di&s;cern &s;everal well dre&s;&s;ed per|&s;ons,
and were &s;urprized with
<PB N="102" REF="105">
the harmony of mu&s;ical in&s;tru|ments.</P>
<P>WHAT does all this portend?
my dear <HI>Hppolitus,</HI> &s;aid <HI>Leander,</HI>
are we going to this fine place,
where plea&s;ures of every &s;pecies
&s;eem collected? What part are
we to act in &s;uch an a&s;&s;embly I
wonder?</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS replied with a
&s;orrowful a&s;pect, we are not
likely to be entertained as gue&s;ts
in the a&s;&s;embly before us; I
conclude we are to exhibit in
in &s;ome neighbouring town, or
perhaps &s;hall not &s;top till we get
to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>As they &s;poke, they ob&s;erved
a gentleman advancing towards
them, who by his air and atten|tants,
appeared a per&s;on of rank.
<PB N="103" REF="106">
<HI>Leander</HI> a&s;ked his friend if he
knew him? No, &s;aid he, but I
take him to be &s;ome nobleman
who lives hereabouts.&mdash;They
were already &s;o near, that the ju&s;|tice
alighted, and &s;aluted him with
great ceremony: My lord, &s;aid
he, I was coming to wait on your
lord&s;hip, to expre&s;s my concern
at being di&s;appointed of the
wre&s;tlers, who engaged to be
with me ye&s;terday.&mdash;I expected
them not till noon, but now I
entirely de&s;pair of &s;eeing them.
His lord&s;hip &s;hewed great marks
of di&s;plea&s;ure in his countenance,
and an&s;wered angerly, if I had
not depended on your promi&s;e, I
&s;hould have taken care to provide
others.&mdash;I invited a great deal
of company, m&egrave;rely with a view
of entertaining them with the&s;e
prizefighters. What would you
have me do, my lord? re&s;umed
<PB N="104" REF="107">
the ju&s;tice, I can offer you four
highwaymen that were taken
la&s;tnight in the fore&s;t, I a&s;&s;ure
your lord&s;hip they made but too
gallant a defence, and I really
believe will afford your lord&s;hip
excellent &s;port. My lord looked
at them, and expre&s;&s;ed his parti|cular
admiration of the fine form
of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and <HI>Leander.</HI> I
thank you, &s;ir, &s;aid he, in a more
polite accent: the&s;e two young
men are as well made as can be
wi&s;hed.&mdash;They will do.&mdash;
Make what ha&s;te you can to the
hou&s;e.&mdash;I will go before and
give orders for your reception.&mdash;
He immediately di&s;patched &s;ome
of his &s;ervants with directions,
leaving the ju&s;tice to proceed on
his march.</P>
<P>LEANDER did not under&s;tand
<HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ufficiently to comprehend
<PB N="105" REF="108">
all that was &s;aid, till <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
fetching a deep &s;igh, O, my dear
<HI>Leander,</HI> what a &s;trange misfor|tune
have we now to encounter.
Good <HI>God!</HI> to what are we re|&s;erved?
To be each others mur|therer.
Explain the meaning of
the&s;e exclamations? &s;aid <HI>Leander,</HI>
I cannot conceive.&mdash;You know,
interrupted <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> the <HI>Ro|mans</HI>
entertained the people with
combats of gladiators, who were
often &s;elected from among&s;t the
criminals intended for execution.
They introduced this cu&s;tom into
<HI>England</HI> when they were ma&s;ters
of it, which &s;till exi&s;ts: with
this difference, that the modern
gladiators are not compelled, but
voluntarily devote them&s;elves to
this occupation, I &s;ay <HI>devote,</HI> be|cau&s;e
they often die of the blows
they receive, and I call it an
occupation, becau&s;e they live by
<PB N="106" REF="109">
the money they earn in it. A
linnen &s;hirt and drawers, pumps,
and a nightcap, is all their dre&s;s.
The &s;tage is &s;anded for their ap|pearance,
and they fight with
broad &s;words, who&s;e points are
guarded.&mdash;With the&s;e they back
each other, engage not to quit
the field till they are wounded
twice or thrice. The wounds
they give are horrid, and they
fight with the utmo&s;t inveteracy,
like de&s;perate enemies, though
they afterwards divide the money
like loving friends.&mdash;It is upon
the whole, a mo&s;t bloody &s;pec|tacle,
and the &s;pectators are not
le&s;s barbarous, nor le&s;s to be
condemned than the combatants.
This is the tragedy they intend
we &s;hould act.&mdash;I to engage
with you, my dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> I
to wound my friend,&mdash;cried
<HI>Leander,</HI> in agony. I will die
<PB N="107" REF="110">
fir&s;t! They were now arrived
at the hou&s;e, and chained as they
were, conducted into a large
hall, where a table was &s;pread
before them, but they ob&s;tinately
refu&s;ed to eat. Here the ju&s;tice
came to acquaint them in the
&s;evere&s;t terms, they mu&s;t pre|pair
with a good grace;&mdash;that
their life and death were in his
hands, and if they &s;hewed the
lea&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, he &s;wore by all
that was &s;acred to hang them
upon the fir&s;t tree;&mdash;that he was
ma&s;ter of their fate, and he ad|vi&s;ed
them for the la&s;t time, not
to provoke him. They &s;trenu|ou&s;ly
reque&s;ted to &s;peak with the
ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e, but the ju&s;|tice,
who had ob&s;erved the &s;trict
union between the two friends,
apprehended they would try to
get excu&s;ed from engaging each
other, would not &s;uffer the me&s;|&s;age
<PB N="108" REF="111">
to be delivered.&mdash;Their
de&s;pair was beyond expre&s;&s;ion;
the time was already elap&s;ed, and
the more they per&s;evered in re|fu&s;ing
the combat, the more
they were menaced with a &s;hame|ful
and a &s;peedy death. This
obliged them to an immediate
re&s;olution that as &s;oon as they
received their &s;words, they would
employ them in &s;elling their
lives at the deare&s;t rate. Furi|ous
with wrath and indignation,
they threw off their coats, &s;eized
their &s;words, and ru&s;hed into the
place appointed for the combat.</P>
<P>THE company had been told
two highwaymen taken in the
fore&s;t, were to entertain them
with an engagement, and the
ground they were to fight upon,
had been railed in for the pur|po&s;e.
A confu&s;ed murmur aro&s;e
<PB N="109" REF="112">
at their entrance every one re|garded
them with wonder; their
youth, beauty, and graceful mein
intere&s;ted all hearts in their fa|vour.
<HI>Leander's</HI> features were
unknown, but &s;everal could not
avoid taking notice of the &s;trik|ing
re&s;emblance between the o|ther
robber, as they believed
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and the earl of <HI>Doug|las's</HI>
&s;on! If one was not &s;ure of
his being in <HI>Italy,</HI> whi&s;pered
they, one could have no doubt
about it! The two faithful
friends, after viewing the audi|ence
with a noble intrepidity,
ca&s;t their eyes upon the wretches
they had to contend with: there
were thirty con&s;tables, whom
the ju&s;tice had placed round the
rail, under his own ob&s;ervation,
not &s;uppo&s;ing any danger near.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="113">
HYPPOLITUS and <HI>Leander</HI>
embraced each other with the
&s;tronge&s;t marks of affection, per|&s;uaded,
that in all human pro|bability,
death was inevitably
their lot, but they had too much
fortitude to be intimidated with
its approach. <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> drew a
degree of con&s;olation, from re|flecting
he &s;hould die unknown,
and that the &s;ecret of his vi&s;it|ing
<HI>Julia</HI> would probably be bu|ried
with him. According to
the plan they had formed, the
two friends threw them&s;elves
with precipitation over the bar|rier,
and running furiou&s;ly to|wards
the ju&s;tice and his con&s;ta|bles,
&s;natched a couple of &s;words,
capable of doing more execution
than tho&s;e they had be&s;towed,
and in a few moments they were
covered with blood, and wounded
in &s;everal places. Things were in
<PB N="111" REF="114">
this &s;tate when <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Lucilla,</HI>
who&s;e natural humanity induced
them to avoid &s;o cruel a diver|&s;ion,
hearing an uncommon noi&s;e,
intermingled with the &s;hrieks of
&s;everal ladies who&s;e pity and terror
was awakened, went to the en|trance
of the amphitheatre, where
the &s;pectators were a&s;&s;embled,
and looking round for the gladi|ators,
who were &s;carcely to be
di&s;tingui&s;hed in the general con|fu&s;ion.
Alas! what was their
di&s;traction when they beheld
their dear <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> and his ge|nerous
friend! Are there words
to expre&s;s their a&s;toni&s;hment.&mdash;
Their affliction,&mdash;their horror&mdash;
at this deplorable, this unex|pected
di&s;covery?&mdash;Merciful
<HI>Heaven!</HI> it is <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI>&mdash;it
is my brother! exclaimed they
with one voice, flying with ra|pidity
towards them, like per&s;ons
<PB N="112" REF="115">
who thought no calamity com|parable
to the death of tho&s;e
they loved! The company a|larmed
and intere&s;ted by this
extraordinary appearance, drew
their &s;words to a&s;&s;i&s;t them;&mdash;
breathle&s;s and pale, <HI>Lucilla</HI> and
<HI>Julia</HI> approached their lovers;
&mdash;their appearance reanimated
their &s;pirits and courage. The
con&s;tables &s;eeing &s;o many &s;words
drawn again&s;t them, thought
only of making a retreat, leaving
the two heroes ma&s;ters of the
field of battle.</P>
<P>BUT the moment their rage
&s;ub&s;ided, their &s;trength failed:
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> fell bathed in blood at
the feet of <HI>Julia:</HI>&mdash;<HI>Leander,</HI>
&s;triving to a&s;&s;i&s;t his friend, &s;unk
down by him, overcome with
faintne&s;s and fatigue. At this
melancholy &s;ight, <HI>Julia</HI> and <HI>Lu|cilla
<PB N="113" REF="116">
Lucilla</HI> could no longer contain
the extravagance of their grief.
<HI>Julia,</HI> all-occupied with a&s;&s;i&s;ting
her dear <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> &s;upported
his head upon her lap, her arm
round his neck, whil&s;t his cheek
was moi&s;tened with her tears.&mdash;
She poured forth the mo&s;t lamen|table
complaints, and endea|voured
to &s;top the blood, which
flowed fa&s;t from one of his
wounds; leaving <HI>Lucilla</HI> at li|berty
to devote her cares to <HI>Le|ander,</HI>
who felt her compa&s;&s;ion
already intere&s;ted in the pre&s;er|vation
of the illu&s;trious &s;tranger,
from a yet &s;tronger motive than
genero&s;ity. The per&s;ons round
him would have removed <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
to have his wounds ex|amined;
but carele&s;s before
whom he &s;poke, he ca&s;t a lan|gui&s;hing
look on <HI>Julia,</HI> and &s;aid
with great emotion, &s;uffer me,
<PB N="114" REF="117">
adorable woman! to expire in
your arms, that my death may
be more tranquil, and more hap|py

reached the ears of very few,
and tho&s;e who heard them con|cluded
they proceeded from that
delirium which is an indication
of approaching death: but the
earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> who was pre&s;ent,
was &s;truck as with a fla&s;h of light|ning.
He knew <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was
not the brother of <HI>Julia;</HI>&mdash;that
they had been educated together;
&mdash;that <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> wounded him
in the garden at <HI>Buckingham,</HI>
when he was carrying her away.
&mdash;He &s;aw in an in&s;tant all he
had to fear! and his mind &s;oon
confirmed the&s;e &s;u&s;picions into
intolerable truths. But when
he learned from the ju&s;tice that
the two gentlemen had appeared
in the di&s;gui&s;e of pedlars, there
<PB N="115" REF="118">
wanted nothing more, nay, much
le&s;s had been &s;ufficient to convince

his wife and <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>&mdash;Yet
he had di&s;&s;imulation enough to

<P>THE two friends were carried
into the &s;ame bedchamber, and
a &s;peedy dre&s;&s;ing applied to their
wounds, which were more large

reflected that the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI>
mu&s;t have &s;een with re&s;entment
and indignation the exce&s;&s;ive

&s;hewed their purpo&s;e was not to
be &s;haken.&mdash;<HI>Lucilla</HI> did not
endure this &s;eparation without a
flood of tears.&mdash;Her brother pro|mi&s;ed
&s;he &s;hould hear from him,
and <HI>Leander</HI> begged permi&s;&s;ion
to acquaint her with their pro|ceedings;
nor was &s;he di&s;plea&s;ed
to have &s;o plau&s;ible a pretext for
<PB N="162" REF="165">
granting what &s;he &s;o earne&s;tly
wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>THE earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> mounted
his hor&s;e, and re&s;igned his coach
for the accommodation of his
wounded friends; who with the
a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a mattre&s;s and cur|tains,
travelled much at their ea&s;e.
In the &s;ituation <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> then
was, what regarded his health
appeared of &s;mall con&s;equence;
and <HI>Leander</HI> was &s;o deeply in
love, that the thought of being
ab&s;ent from <HI>Lucilla,</HI> made him
as mi&s;erable as a man in that cir|cum&s;tance
u&s;ually is.&mdash;They
&s;poke little, and in a plaintive
&s;tyle.&mdash;At about forty miles di&s;|tance
from Lord <HI>Nevil's,</HI> was a
magnificent ca&s;tle, where the
marchione&s;s of <HI>Northampton</HI> re|&s;ided,
a young, and beautiful wi|dow
of that marqui&s;s, who had
<PB N="163" REF="166">
been executed with the duke of
<HI>Northumberland</HI> and Lord <HI>Guil|ford
Dudley.</HI> Here this lady re|tired,
and dedicated the &s;pring of
life to grief and meditation&mdash;
The earl of Su&s;&s;ex was &s;trongly
&s;oliciting her return to court with
Queen <HI>Mary,</HI> but had hitherto
been un&s;ucce&s;sful. In reality all
his indifference proved in&s;uffici|ent
to guard him from the charms
of this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed fair one; he had
vi&s;ited her frequently &s;ince the
ruin of her hou&s;e, and was &s;o
touched with her &s;weetne&s;s, vir|tue
and genero&s;ity, that what he
at fir&s;t imagined only &s;entiments
of pity, proved to be the &s;ofter
emotions of love.</P>
<P>BY this lady the two friends
were received with the mo&s;t flat|tering
marks of civility. Her
own misfortunes di&s;po&s;ed her to
<PB N="164" REF="167">
&s;ympathize with, and endeavour
to alleviate tho&s;e of others; &s;he
intere&s;ted her&s;elf with great hu|manity
in the affliction of <HI>Hyp|politus;</HI>
and the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI>
was too well convinced of her
di&s;cretion to wi&s;h to conceal the
innocent attachment of his friend;
whom the marchione&s;s entreated
him to a&s;&s;ure, it would be doing
the greate&s;t favour imaginable to
accept of her hou&s;e and pur&s;e, as
long as they could be of any &s;er|vice
to his affairs. <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
in&s;en&s;ible as he remained to mo&s;t
things, felt the&s;e generous pro|fe&s;&s;ions
with the warme&s;t grati|titude,
which broke through the
cloud of melancholy that &s;ur|rounded
him, in expre&s;&s;ions e|qual
to the occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN the mean time the earl of
<HI>Douglas</HI> arrived at Lord <HI>Nevil's;</HI>
<PB N="165" REF="168">
but there is no de&s;cribing his
rage at hearing his &s;on was gone.
&mdash;In vain did he e&s;&s;ay to di&s;co|ver
the place of his concealment;
the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex's</HI> precaution
induced him to travel all night
through bye roads;&mdash;and af|ter
they were lodged at the mar|chione&s;s's
hou&s;e, he omitted no
&s;tep to prevent &s;u&s;picion.&mdash;
The amiable <HI>Lucilla</HI> experienced
the effects of her father's ill hu|mour;
he loaded her with re|proaches;
he accu&s;ed her of act|ing
in concert with <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
and &s;aid every thing the mo&s;t
grating and di&s;agreeable, during
their journey to <HI>London.</HI> Wholly
unmoved by the recital of <HI>Julia's</HI>
adventure, his particular intere&s;t
rendered him in&s;en&s;ible to the
cruelty of her fate, and &s;tifled
tho&s;e &s;entiments of tenderne&s;s
<PB N="166" REF="169">
which humanity naturally in|&s;pired.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS con&s;ulted with
his friends on the mo&s;t eligible
means to pur&s;ue: to overtake
the earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> was imprac|ticable,
had they even been ac|quainted
with the road he tra|velled.
They agreed to &s;eparate,
each of them was to repair to a
different &s;eaport, to watch the
earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI> return to <HI>Eng|land,</HI>
and who&s;oever &s;hould fir&s;t
meet with him, engaged to force
him to an&s;wer for his conduct.</P>
<P>WHEN the &s;trength of <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
and <HI>Leander</HI> was &s;uffici|ently
recruited, they informed
<HI>Lucilla</HI> of their intentions, leav|ing
their letters to the care of
the marchione&s;s, to whom they
acknowledged the highe&s;t &s;en&s;e
<PB N="167" REF="170">
of obligation for her ho&s;pitality.
&mdash;Nothing could be more affec|tionate
than their reciprocal a|dieus.&mdash;How
infinitely am I
indebted to you my dear friends!
&s;aid <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> pre&s;&s;ing them to
his brea&s;t. You embrace my
quarrel, you expo&s;e your lives to
revenge it, and far from oppo|&s;ing
your zeal, as perhaps I
ought, I conjure you to exert
your utmo&s;t endeavours to find
my enemy! They a&s;&s;ured him
he might &s;afely rely on their vi|gilance
to demon&s;trate the &s;in|cerity
of their friend&s;hip at the
hazard of their lives. It was a|greed
after the expiration of a
month, they were to meet at the
earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex's</HI> hou&s;e in <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>THE earl then embarked for
<HI>Dieppe,&mdash;Hyppolitus</HI> for <HI>Calais,</HI>
and <HI>Leander,</HI> who accompanied
<PB N="168" REF="171">
him on board the pacquet at
<HI>Dover,</HI> and landed at <HI>Guern|&s;ey.</HI></P>
<P>THE weather was favourable.
But let us now follow <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
to <HI>Calais.</HI>&mdash;Chance guided him
to the &s;ame inn where <HI>Julia</HI> had
lodged.&mdash;His enquiries, and
the de&s;cription he gave, gained
&s;uch intelligence from his ho&s;|te&s;s,
as drew on a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of
que&s;tions natural to the curio&s;ity
and anxiety of a lover:&mdash;as
whether &s;he &s;eemed dejected?&mdash;
Whether &s;he eat?&mdash;What &s;he
&s;aid?&mdash;He de&s;ired to have the
chamber &s;he &s;lept in; which he
entered with the very &s;ame
emotion as if &s;he had been there.
As he traver&s;ed the room with
interrupted &s;teps, ruminating
deeply on his di&s;appointment,&mdash;
he happened to turn his eyes to|wards
<PB N="169" REF="172">
the window, where her
pencil had addre&s;&s;ed him;&mdash;
Good <HI>God!</HI> what a tran&s;port of
wonder, plea&s;ure and con&s;ola|tion
did that &s;ight create! he
ki&s;&s;ed the well-known charac|ters;
and thus enriched, he re|garded
that pane of gla&s;s as a more
brilliant trea&s;ure, than all the
diamonds of the ea&s;t.&mdash;This
tender te&s;timony of his <HI>Julia's</HI>
remembrance, added new fer|vour
to his pa&s;&s;ion; excited his
gratitude to her who was dearer
than life. He lo&s;t no time in
u&s;ing proper methods to be in|formed
of the earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI>
arrival, &s;hould he pa&s;s through
<HI>Calais;</HI> where he waited for him
three weeks, impatient of re|venge.
At length, one evening,
he &s;aw the earl upon the beach,
&s;tepping into a boat, in order to
embark on board the packet.&mdash;
<PB N="170" REF="173">
Then indignation &s;parkled in his
eyes:&mdash;he ha&s;tily &s;eized him
by the arm,&mdash;Before you return
to <HI>England,</HI> my lord, &s;aid he
haughtily, I have &s;omething to
&s;ay to you.&mdash;The earl, irri|tated
at his manner of &s;peaking,
and &s;till more enflamed by mo|tives
of re&s;entment, had not the
lea&s;t objection to follow <HI>Hyppo|litus.</HI>&mdash;They
&s;poke not a word,
&mdash;but every glance they ca&s;t on
each other, provoked their fury
to the highe&s;t pitch.&mdash;They
&s;topped in a remote place, ap|parently
&s;ecure from interrup|tion,
when drawing their &s;words
with precipitation, the one ani|mated
by love and rage, the o|ther
by jealou&s;y and re&s;entment,
they fought in a manner likely to
terminate in the death of one, if
not both antagoni&s;ts.&mdash;Un|guarded,
and carele&s;s of life, each
<PB N="171" REF="174">
gave and received &s;everal de&s;pa|rate
wounds, till <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> im|patient
at meeting with &s;uch an
ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, from a man
he dete&s;ted, redoubled his ef|forts,
and, by a vigorous pu&s;h,
threw the earl on the ground,
and reduced him to a&s;k his life,
which was generou&s;ly granted,
on condition he relea&s;ed <HI>Julia</HI>
from confinement. At that in|&s;tant,
the earl of <HI>Bedford's</HI> valet,
who had followed his lord at a
di&s;tance, and concealed him&s;elf
behind a boat during the com|bat,
perceiving the extremity to
which he was reduced, run be|hind
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and &s;tabbed him
in the back&mdash;He dropped to
all appearance, dead; and the
valet concluding him &s;o, did not
repeat the blow, but rai&s;ing his
ma&s;ter in his arms, &s;upported
him to a fi&s;herman's hut, where
<PB N="172" REF="175">
he laid him upon a bed. A &s;ur|geon
was immediately &s;ent for,
who dre&s;&s;ed his wounds, but
finding the earl re&s;olute not to
remain at <HI>Calais,</HI> he removed
him into the boat, that was &s;till
in waiting. on board the <HI>Dover</HI>
pacquet, in&s;i&s;ting on the &s;urgeon's
attendance to <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>WHILST the unfortunate <HI>Hyp|politus</HI>
was left una&s;&s;i&s;ted and
weltering in blood, and the night
&s;o far advanced, there was little
probability any pa&s;&s;enger &s;hould
travel that way: his gentleman,
who&s;e attachment to his ma&s;ter
was very uncommon, always ap|prehen&s;ive
le&s;t he &s;hould meet
with &s;ome accident, and find|ing
it grew late without his re|turn,
employed a number of per|&s;ons
with flambeaus to &s;earch in
different parts of the town.&mdash;
<PB N="173" REF="176">
As <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> had been three
weeks at <HI>Calais,</HI> he began to be
pretty well known to the inha|bitants:
they &s;oon gained intel|ligence
of the way he was &s;een
to walk, with a per&s;on who
&s;eemed to be of quality. Ad|vancing
towards the fi&s;her's hut,
a track of blood was vi&s;ible;
they pur&s;ued it till they came to
the &s;pot where <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> lay, ex|tended
without &s;en&s;e or motion.
Cutting &s;ome branches of oziers,
and twi&s;ting them into a kind of
cradle, they conveyed him with
tender care to his lodgings. He
was judged to be in &s;o dange|rous
a &s;ituation, that his gentle|man
thought it indi&s;pen&s;ibly ne|ce&s;&s;ary
to write to the earl of
<HI>Douglas</HI> without delay.</P>
<P>THE earl and counte&s;s was
extremely affected with this me|lancholy
<PB N="174" REF="177">
account of an only &s;on,
of &s;uch di&s;tingui&s;hed merit as in|tere&s;ted
the mo&s;t indifferent per|&s;ons
in his favour.&mdash;The effect
it mu&s;t have on every part of
his family may be ea&s;ily con|ceived.</P>
<P>HIS afflicted parents &s;et out
immediately, and finding him on
the verge of the grave, began to
reproach them&s;elves, now it ap|peared
too late, with the violent
mea&s;ures they had urged to op|po&s;e
a pa&s;&s;ion &s;o ju&s;tifiable and
innocent as that of <HI>Hyppolitus.</HI>
He perceived, and was touched
with their di&s;tre&s;s, and forget|ting
the rigour of their conduct,
conjured them to moderate the
tran&s;ports of their &s;orrow, if they
did not wi&s;h him to &s;ink under
its pre&s;&s;ure.</P>
<P><PB N="175" REF="178">
THE earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Lean|der</HI>
met in <HI>London,</HI> at the time
appointed, and no &s;ooner heard
of the duel and its melancholy
con&s;equences to their friend,
than they determined to return
with &s;peed to <HI>France. Hyppoli|tus</HI>
was as much rejoiced at their
pre&s;ence, as the weakne&s;s of his
&s;pirits would admit;&mdash;and they
beheld this apparent danger with
the &s;tronge&s;t emotions of grief.
Notwith&s;tanding the angui&s;h he
endured, he exerted him&s;elf in
pre&s;enting <HI>Leander</HI> to Lord and
Lady <HI>Douglas,</HI> conjuring them
to con&s;ider him as the brother of
his choice, and one, whom if it
&s;hould be the will of <HI>Heaven</HI> to
deprive them of a &s;on, would
&s;upply that tender relation with
affection and duty. The&s;e pa|thetic
words melted all pre&s;ent
into tears. However, in about
<PB N="176" REF="179">
two months, there was a vi&s;ible
amendment in the health of <HI>Hyp|politus.</HI></P>
<P>DURING this interval, <HI>Lean|der,</HI>
who&s;e pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Lucilla</HI>
encrea&s;ed every hour; had en|gaged
the earl of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> to re|pre&s;ent
his preten&s;ions in the mo&s;t
favourable light to Lord <HI>Douglas,</HI>
and try to di&s;cover if an alliance
would be agreeable, that he might
no longer delay writing to his
father on that intere&s;ting &s;ubject.
&mdash;His friend&s;hip with <HI>Alberti,</HI>
&mdash;the per&s;onal merit of <HI>Leander,</HI>
&mdash;connected with his immen&s;e
fortune, had their proper weight
with the earl of <HI>Douglas.</HI>&mdash;
Convinced he could no where
find a more advantageous con|nection
for his daughter, he li&s;|tened
to the propo&s;al with the
highe&s;t &s;atisfaction. <HI>Leander,</HI>
tran&s;ported with joy, immedi|ately
<PB N="177" REF="180">
wrote to his father, at the
&s;ame time &s;oliciting one of his
mo&s;t intimate friends to endea|vour
to &s;often the fir&s;t &s;allies of
wrath.&mdash;He implored the for|givene&s;s
of the deception con|cerning
his journey; and &s;aid
every thing to extenuate his
fault, expatiated largely on the
beauty and accompli&s;hments of
<HI>Lucilla.;</HI> acquainted him with
the favourable di&s;po&s;ition of Lord
<HI>Douglas,</HI> begging him not to re|fu&s;e
his con&s;ent to an alliance in
which his heart was &s;o deeply
concerned, and on who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s
the future happine&s;s of his life
depended. Senator <HI>Alberti,</HI>&mdash;
though extremely &s;urprized to
hear his &s;on was in <HI>England</HI> when
he believed him at <HI>Rome,</HI> would
not &s;uffer his anger to interfere
in de&s;troying the hopes and ex|pectations
he had rai&s;ed. Tho|rougly
<PB N="178" REF="181">
acquainted with the ho|nourable
hou&s;e of <HI>Douglas,</HI> plea&s;|ed
with the amiable virtues of
<HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> and, judging of the
&s;i&s;ter's accompli&s;hments by tho&s;e
of her brother,&mdash;<HI>Lucilla</HI> ap|peared
to his imagination, the
perfection of beauty;&mdash;prepo&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions
which induced him to
give his free con&s;ent and appro|bation
to the propo&s;ed marriage;
and al&s;o to order the nece&s;&s;ary
remittances for <HI>Leander's</HI> ap|pearing
with &s;plendour &s;uitable
to his rank.</P>
<P>HYPPOLITUS began to recruit
before this happy news arrived,
&mdash;and participated in the joy of
his friend and &s;i&s;ter; which con|tributed
not a little to his cure:
&mdash;medical gentlemen &s;trongly
recommended his taking the
waters of <HI>Bourbon,</HI> but he was
<PB N="179" REF="182">
not in a humour to hearken to
their advice; his &s;oul was en|tirely
occupied with &s;chemes of
vengeance.&mdash;Unable to &s;up|port
him&s;elf, he was meditating
a return to <HI>England</HI> in pur&s;uit of
the earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> either to
put him to death or peri&s;h by his
hand. But the tears of his mo|ther;&mdash;the
authority and inter|po&s;ition
of his father;&mdash;the
tender and united &s;upplications
of <HI>Lucilla,</HI> and his two friends,
rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for a heart
like that of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> to longer
re&s;i&s;t.&mdash;Alas! &s;aid he, what is it
you exact from my complai&s;ance?
that I have recour&s;e to remedies
when I conceal within my bo|&s;om
the &s;low-con&s;uming poi&s;on
which counteracts all the&s;e heal|ing
properties:&mdash;How much
more manly;&mdash;how much more
noble, to employ the &s;mall re|mains
<PB N="180" REF="183">
of life in puni&s;hing the ty|rant
of <HI>Julia.</HI> This argument
had no influence with his family,
who were prepared to controvert
it with all the eloquence of af|fection:
and as &s;oon as he was
able to quit his bed, the mar|riage
of <HI>Leander</HI> and <HI>Lucilla</HI> was
&s;olemnized to the &s;atisfaction of
the&s;e happy lovers.</P>
<P>IN about four months from
the time of the duel, the wounds
of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> were &s;ufficiently
healed to enable him to endure
the motion of a carriage.&mdash;The
counte&s;s of <HI>Douglas,</HI> determined
to accompany her daughter to
<HI>Florence;</HI>&mdash;and <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> con|&s;ented
to travel in his equipage
part of the road to <HI>Bourbon.</HI> The
two earls &s;et out for <HI>London,</HI> &s;e|parately,
with the mo&s;t cordial
profe&s;&s;ions of regard.&mdash;The earl
<PB N="181" REF="184">
of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> promi&s;ed to write to
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> at <HI>Bourbon,</HI> and in|form
him of every thing that
concerned the intere&s;t of his love.
&mdash;Forget not to inform me like|wi&s;e
of the health of the fair
marchione&s;s of <HI>Northampton;</HI>&mdash;
The&s;e &s;entiments with which &s;he
has in&s;pired you, and the parti|cular
obligations &s;he has con|fered
on me, will not allow me
to remember her with indiffer|ence.&mdash;And
if any incident
has power to &s;often the rigour of
my fate&punc; it will be to &s;ee my
friend united with that lovely
woman! This drew a thou&s;and
affectionate expre&s;&s;ions of a friend|&s;hip
hardly to be parrallelled. Nor
was <HI>Leander</HI> much le&s;s concern|ed,
at parting with the earl of
<HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> whom he highly e&s;teem|ed:&mdash;You
rob us &s;ir, of one
of our brighte&s;t ornaments, &s;aid
<PB N="182" REF="185">
the earl, politely, yet deprive us
of every pretence for regret!&mdash;
For who that is acquainted with
your merit can, without inju&s;|tice.
envy your happine&s;s!&mdash;
<HI>Leander</HI> replied in terms expre&s;|&s;ive
of gratitude, and they &s;epa|rated
mutually plea&s;ed with each
other.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Moulins,</HI> which is but
four leagues from <HI>Bourbon,</HI> ano|ther
tender &s;eparation en&s;ued.&mdash;
The unre&s;trained chearfulne&s;s of
the young couple was incapable
of exciting any lively emotions
in the heart of <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>&mdash;in|volved
in melancholy; he an&s;|wered
all their good-natured re|proaches
with an air of confirm|ed
&s;adne&s;s.&mdash;Be contented, &s;aid
he, that I hear all your plea&s;an|tries
without di&s;gu&s;t.&mdash;In the
pre&s;ent &s;tate of my mind, it is
<PB N="183" REF="186">
the mo&s;t infallible mark of
friend&s;hip I can give. Alas!
can you doubt that the &s;ight of
your mutual felicity recalls to
my remembrance the in&s;upera|ble
bars to mine: your engage|ments
have never been interrupt|ed!
Hymen has crowned your
loves, without &s;uffering you to
experience the fears,&mdash;the hopes,
&mdash;the jealous &s;u&s;picions,&mdash;the
anxious di&s;appointments I en|dure!
Nor can I flatter my&s;elf
they will ever be terminated but
by death.</P>
<P>THESE reflexion threw him
into a reverie in which he re|mained
ab&s;orbed the re&s;t of the
journey.&mdash;The moment of
parting was uncommonly mourn|ful
and affecting. <HI>Lucilla</HI> could
not expect to &s;ee this brother, &s;o
infinitely dear to her, for years
<PB N="184" REF="187">
for years to come;&mdash;and
<HI>Leander</HI> loved <HI>Lucilla</HI> only
better than he did <HI>Hyppolitus!</HI>
His unhappy friend was &s;en&s;ible
to all &s;ocial affections, nor did
the exce&s;s of his pa&s;&s;ion for <HI>Julia</HI>
weaken his gratitude, or the
goodne&s;s of his heart. He en|treated
them to be a&s;&s;iduous in
enquiring for the earl of <HI>War|wick,</HI>&mdash;and
in giving him the
earlie&s;t information;&mdash;reque&s;ting
them if they did, to &s;end an ex|pre&s;s
to <HI>Venice,</HI> to acquaint him
with his daughter's fate&punc;&mdash;<HI>Le|ander</HI>
had wrote from <HI>Calais,</HI> but
no an&s;wer arrived;&mdash;&s;o that the
anxiety of <HI>Hyppolitus</HI> was ex|treme.
<HI>Leander</HI> and <HI>Lucilla</HI> pa&s;|&s;ed
through <HI>Lyons,</HI> in their way
to <HI>Florence,</HI> whil&s;t <HI>Hyppolitus</HI>
pur&s;ued the road to <HI>Bourbon.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="185" REF="188">
THE &s;ituation of that town is
di&s;agreeable;&mdash;the hou&s;es ill
built;&mdash;the &s;alubrity of its
&s;prings are its only recommen|dation,
and the certainty of
meeting with polite company.&mdash;
This indeed was no inducement
to <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI> who preferred &s;o|litude,
where he could indulge
his &s;orrowful meditations, to the
pre&s;ence of tho&s;e whom com|plai&s;ance
would oblige him to
conver&s;e with.&mdash;He therefore
avoided contracting any acquain|tance,
and as walking was part
of the regimen pre&s;cribed, &s;ought
the mo&s;t unfrequented &s;hades,
ruminating with an air of &s;ettled
melancholy that deterred every
one from acco&s;ting him in a
place where cu&s;tom admits the
mo&s;t familiar advances without
the imputation of impertinence,
and where the greate&s;t joy is the
<PB N="186" REF="189">
acqui&s;ition of &s;ome new acquain|tance,
<HI>Hyppolitus</HI> &s;auntered
forth one morning, and taking
the fir&s;t untrodden path he met
with, found him&s;elf in&s;en&s;ibly
in the mid&s;t of a wood, which
pre&s;ented to his view a va&s;t vari|ety
of rural beauties. He &s;top|ped
upon a hanging hill, &s;haded
by the branches of &s;preading
beech trees, which &s;heltered it
from the rays of the &s;un:&mdash;he
leaned pen&s;ively &s;ome time, and
then engraved the&s;e words on the
bark of the tree which had &s;up|ported
him:</P>
<P>&startq;How would this delightful
intermixture of wood and mea|dows,
this winding brook &s;port|ing
through yo$ lovely vale,
&s;potted with cottages; how
would the&s;e &s;miling &s;cenes of
nature charm away the &s;en&s;e
<PB N="187" REF="190">
of pain, could I behold their
beauties without thinking of
tho&s;e of <HI>Climene!</HI> but, alas!
&s;he is ab&s;ent, and that reflec|tion
&s;addens all the pro&s;pect,
and &s;harpens the pangs of af|fliction.&endq;</P>
<P>LOST in that reflection; he did
not immediately perceive a fold|ed
paper at his feet, nor when
he did, was his curio&s;ity excited
to take it up; but as the wind
was rather rough, a &s;entiment of
benevolence for the per&s;on who
had dropped the letter, tempted
him to prevent its falling into o|ther
hands: &s;tooping from that
motive, he found it only an en|clo&s;ure
to a chagrine ca&s;e, which,
on opening, pre&s;ented a minia|ture
painting.&mdash;But what was
his &s;urprize,&mdash;his rapture! when
he &s;aw it re&s;embled the features
<PB N="188" REF="191">
of his dear <HI>Julia!</HI> though on a
more attentive examination, he
knew it to be the portrait of her
mother, the counte&s;s of <HI>Warwick,</HI>
which he recollected to have &s;een
in her hand. Attaching his eyes
to an object that awakened a
thou&s;and &s;adly tender remem|rances;
he fell into deep con|templation
on the &s;trange chance
that had thrown it in his way.&mdash;
I am certain, it was my <HI>Julia's,</HI>
he exclaimed; &s;he prized it too
high to part with it;&mdash;&s;ome one
mu&s;t have robbed her! when in
her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, it was &s;et with di|amonds.&mdash;I
find it in an ordinary
ca&s;e!&mdash;But has the theft been
committed in <HI>England</HI> or in
<HI>France?</HI> Probability &s;eems to
an&s;wer the latter.</P>
<P>IN this confu&s;ion of ideas, he
ob&s;erved a man of decent ap|pearance
<PB N="189" REF="192">
advancing towards him,
who no &s;ooner perceived the pic|ture,
than acco&s;ting him with
re&s;pect, &s;ir, &s;aid he, I have been
in great di&s;tre&s;s at lo&s;ing the pic|ture
you have in your hand,&mdash;
and &s;hall ever acknowledge my
obligation to you for re&s;toring it.
Before I do that &s;aid <HI>Hyppolitus,</HI>
I mu&s;t reque&s;t the favour of
knowing from whom you re|ceived
it? I am a painter, &s;ir,
who con&s;tantly attend the &s;ea&s;ons
at <HI>Bourbon,</HI> where from the great
re&s;ort of company that drink
the waters, I &s;ell my performan|ces
at a better price than any
where el&s;e. I am often employ|ed
by the abbe&s;s of St. <HI>Menoux,</HI>
about two leagues from hence,
who is fitting up a cabinet in an
elegant &s;tyle; and the other
day &s;he &s;ent for me to explain
her intentions, and to a&s;k if I
<PB N="190" REF="193">
cho&s;e to employ my pencil there
for &s;ome time: whil&s;t I was &s;et|tling
the affair, a lady entered
the cabinet, who&s;e accent in|formed
me &s;he was a foreigner.
&mdash;I thought her exqui&s;itely beau|tiful,
though the palene&s;s of her
complexion &s;eemed to indicate
her being but ju&s;t recovered from
&s;ome violent di&s;order. She a&s;ked
me if I could mend a defect in the
drapery of a miniature picture,
that had been injured by a drop
of water? Taking it out of a
diamond ca&s;e, &s;he gave it me, and
I promi&s;ed to repair the damage,
in which I have &s;ucceeded, &s;ir,
as you may perceive.&mdash;I promi&s;ed
the lady to bring it to-day, but
taking a walk here in &s;earch of a
nobleman who has bought &s;ome
of my works, I accidentally
dropt it.</P>
