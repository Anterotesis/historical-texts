<HEAD>AN ANSWER To a late PAMPHLET, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></HEAD>
<P>I Have always had the utmo&s;t Contempt for in&s;ignifi|cant, unrea&s;oning, florid Declamations upon <HI>&s;e|rious Subjects.</HI> When the mo&s;t important Concerns of a Nation are at Stake, I confe&s;s, it moves my Indignation to &s;ee a <HI>little Epigrammatical Politician,</HI> &s;tart up, with a Shool-boy's Conceit, dre&s;s'd out in the u&s;ual Ornaments of &s;uch Compo&s;itions; e&s;pecially, when the Author's &s;ordid Purpo&s;e &s;tares us full in the Face through every Line.</P>
<P>The <HI>Pamphlet,</HI> which lies before me and gives Occa&s;i|on to the&s;e Thoughts, is indeed &s;uch a pompous Jargon of Words, without an&s;wering any one Point, or aiming at any End, that it may &s;eem beneath all Critici&s;m; and I find the <HI>Gentlemen concern'd</HI> look upon it in this Light, by not having taken the lea&s;t Notice of it; but, as many Things become con&s;iderable, by &s;ome particular Circum|&s;tances which attend them; &s;o, perhaps, it may be thought that even this <HI>frothy Piece of Pedantry</HI> hath &s;ome Value &s;tamp'd upon it by the Approbation of <HI>Tho&s;e,</HI> who have order'd their <HI>Creatures</HI> to cry it up as an excellent Performance, and taken great Pains to propagate it through the Kingdom. This will, at lea&s;t, be my Excu&s;e for be|&s;towing
<PB N="4" REF="3">
a few cur&s;ory Remaaks upon it, without any Re|gard to the <HI>Thing</HI> it&s;elf, or the <HI>Author</HI> of it.</P>
<P>One Way of expo&s;ing the Nothingne&s;s of <HI>&s;uch Producti|ons,</HI> is by throwing back the <HI>Shuttlecock;</HI> and making U&s;e of their own little Turns to condemn the Cau&s;e, which They mean to defend. That this frivolous Manner of Writing may appear in a &s;tronger Light, I will begin with &s;hewing that, in many Places, the &s;ame Sentence, with the Change or Omi&s;&s;ion only of a Word or two, will read much better on the contrary Side. I hope the <HI>Ob&s;ervator</HI> will not make any Objections to this Method of dallying with Him; &s;ince it hath been &s;o often practis'd by his ingenious Brethen, the Writers again&s;t the <HI>Craft&s;man;</HI> and He will perceive, from the Sequel, that it is not my De&s;ign to dwell long upon &s;uch a trifling Way of an&s;wer|ing an Adver&s;ary; but only to expo&s;e it, and for the Sake of reviving my Schoolboy's Talent of writing upon a <HI>Theme.</HI></P>
<P>For this Rea&s;on, I &s;hall not trouble my&s;elf with the per&s;onal Circum&s;tances of the <HI>Author.</HI>&mdash;Sometimes He <HI>hunts</HI> with the <HI>Mini&s;ter.</HI> Sometimes, He turns over the mouldy Records of Philo&s;ophers, But, by his frequent <HI>Theological Allu&s;ions,</HI> and his favourite Peal of <HI>Bells,</HI> He &s;eems to be a <HI>Divine;</HI> whom the Death of the Bi&s;hop of <HI>Durham,</HI> and the <HI>Train-Trow</HI> of Preferments, en&s;uing upon that Event, have affected with the warm Scent of &s;ome <HI>fat Benefice.</HI>&mdash;Poor <HI>Caleb!</HI> How the mo&s;t ordinary Events are turn'd to thy De&s;truction?</P>
<P>I &s;hall now proceed to the <HI>Author</HI>'s Words, with a few <HI>paraphra&s;tical Alterations,</HI> di&s;tingui&s;h'd in <HI>Italicks.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I am not ignorant of the unequal Terms, upon which He enters the Li&s;ts in a Paper-War, who draws his Pen on the defen&s;ive Side. Tho&s;e, who engage the <HI>Hopes,</HI> the <HI>Covetou&s;ne&s;s,</HI> and the <HI>Ambition</HI> of Mankind to their Party, will generally, I fear, lead more numer|ous Troops and find much better Encouragement than Tho&s;e, who &s;ollicit the <HI>Love of their Country</HI> and appeal &endq;to Ju&s;tice.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;For as mo&s;t Men have tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, whil&s;t few are ble&s;s'd with a <HI>publick Spirit,</HI> and <HI>Men are generally more
<PB N="5" REF="4">
fond of a</HI> PENSION <HI>than a</HI> PILLORY; &s;o the Glare of <HI>Court-Favour,</HI> though nevet &s;o <HI>ba&s;ely acquir'd,</HI> will dazzle much greater Numbers than the cleare&s;t Rea&s;oning and &endq;mo&s;t conclu&s;ive Arguments will ever enlighten.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;But notwith&s;tanding the Di&s;advantages, which, from the <HI>&s;elf intere&s;ted Di&s;po&s;ition of</HI> Human Kind, They &s;ome|times labour under, who undertake the ju&s;ter Cau&s;e; as I flatter my&s;elf that on &s;ome Occa&s;ions, the Hone&s;ty of their Minds may recoil again&s;t their Propen&s;ity to <HI>Flattery,</HI> and will not &s;uffer the Depravity of their Na|tures <HI>to get the better of their Conciences;</HI> I &s;hall not be deterr'd by the Di&s;couragements I have enumerated from entering into a &s;hort Examination of the original De&s;ign, Progre&s;s and Effects of the Writings <HI>again&s;t</HI> the &endq;<HI>Craft&s;man.</HI></Q></P>
<P>The fir&s;t Article of Impeachment is their having <HI>u&s;urp'd a Right of circulating guarded Trea&s;ons and weekly Fal&s;hoods throughout the Kingdom.</HI>&mdash;But before We proceed to the <HI>Defence,</HI> it is nece&s;&s;ary to define and &s;ettle the Meaning of the Terms made U&s;e of in the <HI>Indict|ment.</HI></P>
<P><HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> the Phra&s;e, <HI>u&s;urping,</HI> &s;eems to accknowledge that there is an undoubted, indefeazeable Right of <HI>circulating Fal&s;hoods</HI> ve&s;ted in <HI>&s;ome Per&s;ons;</HI> and that the <HI>Craft&s;man</HI> is only an <HI>U&s;urper</HI> of it: If this is really the Ca&s;e, our Au|thor is much to be commended for endeavouring to <HI>depo&s;e Him;</HI> and for my Part, I am ready to own the Right of <HI>Tho&s;e,</HI> who have &s;o long exercis'd this <HI>noble Imperfection</HI> with unlimited Authority.</P>
<P>The next remarkable <HI>Term,</HI> made U&s;e of in the <HI>Indict|ment,</HI> is the Word <HI>circulating;</HI> by which, I pre&s;ume, We are to under&s;tand &s;ending Papers about the Country; and I believe the be&s;t <HI>Circulators</HI> will be found on the Side of <HI>this Author</HI> and his <HI>Patrons;</HI> for They have the Clerks of the <HI>Po&s;t-Office, Cu&s;toms</HI> and <HI>Exci&s;e;</HI> who are not only in|dulg'd in the &s;ame Privilege with Members of Parliament to <HI>frank Letters,</HI> but may po&s;&s;ibly be commanded to take off and di&s;per&s;e many Papers, even at the <HI>publick Expence;</HI> by which Means, They are become the mo&s;t con&s;iderable <HI>Hawkers</HI> in the Kingdom. I am likewi&s;e told, that <HI>the&s;e Officers</HI> have been lately laid under &s;ome Re&s;traints, and
<PB N="6" REF="5">
prohibited, on Pain of Di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, from getting a Penny in their Way, by <HI>circulating</HI> any of the <HI>Craft&s;man</HI>'s <HI>guar|ded Trea&s;ons.</HI> Their chief Bu&s;ine&s;s, at pre&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ts in <HI>circulating weekly Fal&s;hoods</HI> and the <HI>unguarded, explicit Trea|&s;ons</HI> of the <HI>London Journal</HI> and the <HI>Free-Briton.</HI></P>
<P>In the la&s;t Place, the Term <HI>guarded Trea&s;ons</HI> de&s;erves &s;ome Notice.</P>
<P>I never apprehended before, that there was any other Species of <HI>written Trea&s;on,</HI> but <HI>a&s;&s;erting the</HI> Pretender'<HI>s Right to the Crown,</HI> or <HI>denying That of his pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty King</HI> George, <HI>and the Succe&s;&s;ion in his Family.</HI> Is the <HI>Craft&s;|man</HI> guilty, upon this Article, by con&s;tantly and clearly defending the <HI>Principles of the Revolution,</HI> and the <HI>Parlia|mentary Right of limiting the Succe&s;&s;ion to the Crown?</HI> No; the <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> with which he &s;tands charg'd, is <HI>guarded Trea|&s;on.</HI> Guarded by <HI>what?</HI>&mdash;By the <HI>Law;</HI> that is, <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> which the <HI>Law</HI> hath not declared to be <HI>Trea&s;on.</HI> I don't like, by any Means, this new Species of <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> which is not to be found in our <HI>Statute-Books. Guarded Trea&s;on,</HI> in the Hands of a <HI>guarded Mini&s;ter,</HI> may prove very dange|rous. I take <HI>this Term,</HI> according to its natural Interpre|tation, to mean &s;omething, which might be wre&s;ted into <HI>Trea&s;on</HI> in a Court of Ju&s;tice, if the <HI>Law</HI> did not <HI>guard</HI> the <HI>pretended Delinquent;</HI> &s;omething, which would be call'd <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> if We had an <HI>Attorney-General,</HI> and <HI>no Law;</HI> but is not <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> &s;ince we have <HI>Law,</HI> as well as an <HI>Attorney-General.</HI>&mdash;This &s;ame <HI>Law</HI> is a &s;trange, uncourtly, uncom|plai&s;ant Sort of a Thing; and ties up the Hands of an <HI>an|gry Mini&s;ter,</HI> in a mo&s;t unrea&s;onable Manner.</P>
<P>But &s;ince <HI>this Writer</HI> hath thought fit to coin a new Species of <HI>Trea&s;on,</HI> I mu&s;t put him in Mind, that there is not a more heinous Kind of Trea&s;on, than to undermine tho&s;e Foundations of the Con&s;titution, which equally &s;up|port the <HI>Rights of the Crown,</HI> and the <HI>Liberties of the Peo|ple.</HI> They are in&s;eparably cemented together; and he, who attempts to &s;hake the <HI>one,</HI> mu&s;t of Cour&s;e weaken the <HI>other.</HI></P>
<P>Before I leave this Head, I mu&s;t ju&s;t take Notice that the Ca&s;e of poor Mr. <HI>D' Anvers,</HI> &s;eems to be very odd and extraordinary. Whil&s;t he is openly threaten'd with Cor|rection by <HI>one Writer,</HI> who is a <HI>profe&s;s'd Nonjuring Par&s;on,</HI> for being <HI>too much a Whig,</HI> and having &s;poken di&s;re&s;pect|fully
<PB N="7" REF="6">
of &s;ome of the <HI>Stuarts,</HI> he is charg'd by <HI>another</HI> (I might &s;ay by <HI>&s;everal others</HI>) with being a <HI>Jacobite,</HI> and ha|ving a De&s;ign to &s;et up the <HI>Pretender,</HI> who claims the Crown, as Heir of <HI>that Family.</HI>&mdash;This is &s;omewhat like the Ca&s;e of our Countrymen in the Reign of <HI>Harry the Eight;</HI> when they were <HI>hang'd</HI> for being <HI>Papi&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>burn'd</HI> for being <HI>Prote&s;tants; Dij immortales!</HI> (cry'd a <HI>Fo|reigner) quomodo vivunt Homines in i&s;tis Regionibus? Su&s;pen|duntur</HI> Papi&s;tici; <HI>comburuntur Anti-Papi&s;tici.</HI></P>
<P>If the <HI>Author of the Ob&s;ervations</HI> &s;hould likewi&s;e prove to be a <HI>Nonjuring Par&s;on,</HI> (as the Town generally &s;uppo&s;es him to be) I leave it to be con&s;ider'd whether his Re&s;ent|ment again&s;t the <HI>Writings of the Craft&s;man,</HI> may not pro|ceed from the <HI>&s;ame Motives,</HI> which actuate his Brother <HI>Earbery;</HI> and whether he might not think the mo&s;t politick Way of venting his Spleen, was to take upon him&s;elf the Character of a <HI>Courtier,</HI> and write under the Di&s;gui&s;e of an Advocate for the <HI>Mini&s;try.</HI></P>
<P>But to proceed in our Author's Strain.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;P. 7. <HI>A certain,</HI> GREAT MAN hath, by a &s;ort of Pa|pal Authority, taken upon him to <HI>dictate to his Fellow-labourers in the Mini&s;try,</HI> as dogmatically, as unfairly, and as ignorantly as his Holine&s;s; <HI>and to impo&s;e his</HI> Opinions <HI>and</HI> Mea&s;ures <HI>as infallible; and when</HI> Experience <HI>hath proved the</HI> one <HI>erroneous,</HI> and the <HI>other un&s;ucce&s;sful,</HI> his In|vention &s;upplies his <HI>Wi&s;dom, endeavouring to correct</HI> the &endq;pa&s;t Blunder <HI>with a</HI> fre&s;h one.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;But unle&s;s he could contrive that the Reading of <HI>pub|lick Papers</HI> &s;hould be prohibited to <HI>the Engli&s;h,</HI> as the Go&s;pel is to the Followers of the Pope, his Frauds may chance to be detected; the Sect of <HI>political Jan&s;eni&s;ts</HI> in|crea&s;e; &endq;and his <HI>Bills</HI> not received with implicit Faith.</Q></P>
<P>I had once re&s;olved to pa&s;s over <HI>this Paragraph</HI> of our Author, which contains &s;ome indecent Reflections on our worthy Friend the <HI>Cardinal.</HI> Far be it from me, to di|&s;turb that &s;acred and my&s;terious Union between <HI>two great Mini&s;ters;</HI> by which, at the &s;ame Time, the <HI>Papal Domi|nion</HI> is &s;trenghtened in <HI>France,</HI> and the <HI>Prote&s;tant Succe&s;&s;ion</HI> &s;upported in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>But the <HI>Craft&s;man</HI> treats the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> too roughly; on which Occa&s;ion our <HI>Author</HI> makes the following Reflecti|on.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">P. S. <Q>For as the Brutality of an Executioner does not &startq;prove the Innocence of him who &s;uffers; &s;o it is po&s;&s;i|ble for a Criminal to de&s;erve his Puni&s;hment, though &endq;one abhors the Hand that inflicts it.</Q></P>
<P>It appears from hence, that it is the <HI>Brutality of the At|tack,</HI> and not the <HI>Innocence of the Party attacked,</HI> which hath induced the <HI>Author</HI> to publi&s;h the&s;e notable <HI>Ob&s;erva|tions;</HI> but is not the <HI>Law</HI> to be put in Execution, becau&s;e <HI>Jack Ketch</HI> may &s;ometimes behave him&s;elf a little but|cherly in his Office?&mdash;I confe&s;s, indeed, that <HI>Halters,</HI> and <HI>Axes,</HI> and <HI>Pillories,</HI> and <HI>Scaffolds,</HI> are not very agree|able Objects either to a <HI>good-natur'd</HI> or a <HI>wicked Man;</HI> but whatever <HI>this Author</HI> may think of them, I am &s;ure his <HI>Patron</HI> will allow that they have been of &s;ome U&s;e to <HI>his Admini&s;tration,</HI> and ought not to be laid intirely a&s;ide.</P>
<P>P. 9. <Q>Many pompous Profe&s;&s;ons <HI>are daily made for the &startq;De&s;ign of their</HI> Undertaking. Private Views were the Mask or publick Good; the Spirit of <HI>Slavery affects the Dre&s;s and Language</HI> of the Spirit of Liberty; the Wel|fare of the Nation, and Loyalty to the King, are made the plau&s;ible Pretences, for throwing among&s;t the Peo|ple, <HI>&s;uch Doctrines as tend to the De&s;truction of his Govern|ment.</HI>&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;For a little while, indeed, all the Arrows in <HI>their</HI> Quiver, &s;eem'd to be directed &s;olely at one Mark; <HI>a Gentleman, who happened to vent a Piece of</HI> guarded Trea|&s;on <HI>in the Hou&s;e of Commons; preferring the Safety of the</HI> &endq;Nation <HI>to the Pre&s;ervation of the</HI> Mini&s;ter.</Q></P>
<P>But if I am righly informed of that Affair, (which hath been &s;o often exaggarated as a bloody-minded Vow) it was no more than a warm Expre&s;&s;ion, &s;ignifying his Re|&s;olution to do what in him lay, to de&s;troy the Power of the <HI>Mini&s;ter;</HI> for he immediately added, as a Rea&s;on, that he would otherwi&s;e de&s;troy the Nation; and if all his At|tempts to fulfil <HI>this Vow</HI> &s;hould prove un&s;ucce&s;sful, it is to be feared, that the <HI>prophetical Part</HI> of his Speech, will &s;oon be too amply verify'd.</P>
<P>If <HI>this Gentleman</HI> made any additional Vow, not to <HI>eat</HI> or <HI>drink,</HI> till he had done the Nation this Piece of Service, the <HI>pre&s;ent, plump Condition</HI> of his Per&s;on, is a plain Proof that he hath broke it mo&s;t flagrantly; and he hath only rais'd his Adver&s;ary to a Parallel with St. <HI>Paul.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="9" REF="8">What an Honour is it for St. <HI>Paul</HI> to be the Type of a <HI>fir&s;t Mini&s;ter</HI> of three Kingdoms? If the <HI>Sir</HI> does not come quite up to the <HI>Saint,</HI> can it be denied that he re&s;embles him in <HI>&s;ome Circum&s;tances?</HI> Hath not the <HI>Mini&s;ter</HI> been in <HI>Pri&s;on,</HI> as well as the <HI>Saint?</HI>&mdash;Hath he not been in Perils amog&s;t <HI>fal&s;e Brethren?</HI>&mdash;Hath he not renounc'd the <HI>Prin|ciples,</HI> which he once e&s;pous'd with great Zeal?&mdash;Is not this <HI>he,</HI> who formerly per&s;ecuted <HI>frenchify'd Mini&s;ters,</HI> and who now preacheth up the glad Tidings of a <HI>French Al|lyance?</HI>&mdash;O, may the <HI>Sir Mini&s;ter</HI> never &s;tand in need of the <HI>Saint</HI>'s <HI>Basket?</HI>&mdash;How impotent is this <HI>Ananias</HI> of a <HI>Craft&s;man,</HI> who hath not been yet able to <HI>open his Eyes?</HI>&mdash; How thick and adherent mu&s;t tho&s;e <HI>Scales</HI> be, which &s;carce a <HI>Miracle</HI> can make to fall off?</P>
<P>P. 11. <Q>However <HI>as</HI> the whole Stream of their Ma|lice, &startq;for &s;ome Time, flow'd only in this Channel, to vi|lify this <HI>great</HI> Mini&s;ter's Name; <HI>&s;o, on the other hand, no le&s;s Indu&s;try and Art were u&s;ed to extoll</HI> his Conduct; <HI>to magnify</HI> his Services; <HI>to brighten</HI> his Character; <HI>and for|tify</HI> his Credit with his Prince. All Hands were em|ploy'd; and all Engines &s;et at work. <HI>Letters were for|ged and pretended to be intercepted at the Po&s;t-Office, in which the Continuance of his Admini&s;tration was repre&s;ented of the utmo&s;t Importance to publick Credit;</HI> the Pre&s;s was loaded; Coffee-hou&s;e <HI>Lyons,</HI> Table-<HI>Spies,</HI> and Bottle Compani|ons had their In&s;tructions given them; the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Fal|&s;hoods were inculcated in the gro&s;&s;e&s;t Terms; the &s;a|cred <HI>Rece&s;&s;es of Families were invaded; the more &s;acred Re|putation of the Fair Sex was violated; private Conver&s;ation was made the Subject of perjur'd Affidavits;</HI> and the Laws of Nature, Cu&s;tom, Principle, Morality and Society &endq;trampled upon and broken.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Minerva<HI>'s,</HI> Fames with <HI>double Trumpet$&punc;</HI> and all the fa|bulous Machinery of the Ancients, were introduced to oppo&s;e the <HI>Sejanus</HI>'s, and <HI>Wol&s;ey</HI>'s <HI>of former Ages, and the</HI> Menzikoffs, Co&s;cia's <HI>and</HI> Mackheaths <HI>of later Dates. Ita|licks</HI> grew &s;o familiar on both &s;ides, that it occa&s;ioned even a &endq;new Foundery of tho&s;e Letters.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;But &s;till the <HI>great Man</HI> was able to repel the Weapons of his Adver&s;aries, by the <HI>Superior</HI> Temper of his <HI>Metal. His Quiet was invulnerable,</HI> (pardon the Impropriety of the Au|thor's Expre&s;&s;ion, which is the Effect of his being already dry-brain'd
<PB N="10" REF="9">
of Epithets) <HI>and he contemn'd Accu&s;ations, which his</HI> well-temper'd <HI>Con&s;cience did not</HI> feel; <HI>he</HI> mi&s;took <HI>the</HI> Voice of the People <HI>for the</HI> Voice of his per&s;onal Enemies; <HI>con|&s;ider'd all their Clamour as the Effect of Competition, Di&s;appointment, and a Tax upon Royal Favour.</HI> Oh! may he place <HI>this Tax</HI> to the Account of the <HI>Sinking Fund</HI> &endq;in lieu of tho&s;e Sums, which he hath taken from it!</Q></P>
<P>When our Author made his pretty Ob&s;ervation, that the mo&s;t <HI>illuminated Bodies</HI> have the <HI>deepe&s;t Shadows,</HI> he &s;eems to have had St. <HI>Peter</HI> in his Eye, whom the People follow'd in Crowds, to be <HI>ble&s;s'd with the Sweep of his Sha|dow, as he pa&s;s'd by;</HI> and he wou'd, no doubt, have intro|duc'd <HI>this Apo&s;tle,</HI> as well as St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in his Pangerick, had it not been for that unlucky Circum&s;tance in the Hi|&s;tory of his Life; <HI>Silver and Gold have I none.</HI></P>
<P>Nothing is more ob&s;ervable than the &s;udden Tran|&s;itions of <HI>this Author,</HI> and his Skill in jumbling inco|herent Metaphors together, as will appear from the fol|lowing Paragraph.</P>
<P>P. 13. <Q>But when this Scent became &s;o cold, that po|litical &startq;&s;port&s;men grew weary of following a <HI>Pack of Ani|mals, (now you &s;ee, they are</HI> Hounds) who were always barking at a Prey they could not wound, and following what they could not overtake; and that the&s;e Writers had <HI>rung the Changes (now they are</HI> Ringers) on the Words <HI>Corruption, Bribery, Male-Admini&s;tration, Oppre&s;|&s;ion</HI> and <HI>Inju&s;tice,</HI> till People were &s;o habituated to the <HI>Vox &amp; praeterea nihil,</HI> that the <HI>Peal</HI> laid tho&s;e to <HI>&s;leep,</HI> &endq;whom the <HI>Ringers</HI> propos'd it &s;hould <HI>alarm.</HI></Q></P>
<P>He might have added <HI>five more Bells</HI> to this Peal, and made it compleat; <HI>French-Allyances, Depredations, Dun|kirk, He&s;&s;ians, Iri&s;h-Recruits;</HI> and if He had been at a lit|tle more Pains, He might have even furni&s;h'd out a <HI>Dutch Chime.</HI></P>
<P>But, <HI>dear Sir,</HI> let me advi&s;e you to be a little more &s;par|ing of your <HI>Metaphors,</HI> or to chu&s;e them better. Take my Word for it, that the <HI>barking of Dogs,</HI> and the <HI>jangling o$ Bells,</HI> are two of the mo&s;t unlikely Things you could hav$ po&s;&s;ibly hit upon, to lull any Body a-&s;leep. Why, a Ma$ mu&s;t read three or four Pages even of your <HI>own Works</HI> before he can po&s;&s;ibly get a Nap, either in a <HI>Bell-fry</HI> or <HI>Dog-Kennel.</HI>&mdash;But if the <HI>Craft&s;man</HI>'s <HI>Bells</HI> have laid Tho&s;$

who endeavour by Adulation, or other ba&s;e Means, to ex|alt the Power of any <HI>one</HI> Branch of it above the <HI>others,</HI> is an Enemy to the <HI>whole;</HI> which mu&s;t be de&s;troy'd, if his Endeavours &s;ucceed.&mdash;I will &s;peak a little more plainly on this Subject; as every <HI>Engli&s;hman</HI> hath a Right to do.</P>
<P>The <HI>Craft&s;man</HI> hath a&s;&s;erted the Doctrine of <HI>Liberty,</HI> with a View to the Intere&s;t of the <HI>Nation in general,</HI> and without any <HI>particular Applications.</HI> He hath &s;hewn that <HI>Liberty</HI> is the fundamental Ba&s;is of our Con&s;titution; and that it cannot be pre&s;erv'd, without keeping the Spirit of it alive. He hath produc'd In&s;tances, from Hi&s;tory, of various Attempts, in various Reigns, again&s;t the <HI>Liberty</HI> of his Country; &s;ometimes by <HI>Mini&s;ters;</HI> &s;ometimes by <HI>Kings,</HI> and &s;ometimes by <HI>Queens;</HI> which he hath apply'd to his <HI>general Doctrine;</HI> and &s;hewn that when the <HI>Spirit of Liber|ty</HI> hath been pre&s;erv'd, all the&s;e Attempts have proved vain and abortive.&mdash;To &s;ay that he does this with a <HI>Ja|cobite View</HI> (as the little Fry of Scriblers again&s;t him have a&s;&s;erted) is trifling and in&s;ignificant.&mdash;It is done with a manife&s;t View to pre&s;erve the <HI>Con&s;titution,</HI> and <HI>the pre&s;ent Royal Family;</HI> which was placed at the Head of the Government, to pre&s;erve the Con&s;titution upon <HI>the&s;e Prin|ciples,</HI> and <HI>no other;</HI> for even the HEAD <HI>of our State</HI> (to u&s;e the <HI>Author</HI>'s Phra&s;e) is but one <HI>Branch of our Con&s;tituti|on,</HI> and ought to be look'd upon only in this Light. He is re&s;trained by <HI>Laws</HI> as well as the <HI>others;</HI> and bound by an <HI>Oath</HI> to maintain Them?&mdash;I am &s;ure This is the Principle of an <HI>hone&s;t Briton.</HI> It is the Principle of the <HI>pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment;</HI> and of the Revolution, upon which it is founded. Let it not be &s;aid, that I mention the <HI>Re|volution,</HI> as a menacing In&s;inuation, or with any View to <HI>another.</HI> I mention it for the Honour of his <HI>pre&s;ent Maje|&s;ty,</HI> as his Title is e&s;tabli&s;h'd upon that <HI>glorious Foundation;</HI> (which ought never to be forgot;) and, I hope, the Crown of the&s;e Realms will continue in his <HI>Royal Family,</HI> till Time &s;hall be no more; but it mu&s;t continue upon this <HI>Principle of Liberty;</HI> and <HI>Tho&s;e Men,</HI> who endeavour to in&s;till any other Notions into his Royal Brea&s;t, are the mo&s;t dangerous Enemies to his Government. They are <HI>vile Flatterers,</HI> and <HI>dete&s;table Sycophants;</HI> who have been the wor&s;t Bane of Princes in all Ages.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">The Argumentation of our Author, upon this Head, is therefore as awkard as his <HI>Panegyrick.</HI> He taxes the <HI>Craft&s;man</HI> with drawing a Parallel between <HI>Edward</HI> the IVth's <HI>Queen,</HI> and her <HI>pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty;</HI> and yet, at the &s;ame Time, gives the plaine&s;t Rea&s;on in the World, from the Matter of Fact mentioned by the <HI>Craft&s;man,</HI> that he could not mean it as &s;uch; <HI>becau&s;e the Circum&s;tances do not agree.</HI>&mdash;There is certainly a wide Difference between a Paralell, and an Example; between an Invective and an Admonition; between a Conduct, erroneous in &s;ome Par|ticulars, and a Character ab&s;olutely vicious.&mdash;I will leave the World to judge, which of the <HI>two,</HI> mo&s;t proba|bly intends the <HI>Ship-wreck;</HI> he, who &s;ets up the <HI>Beacon;</HI> or he, who takes it away?&mdash;Where the rough <HI>Spirit of Liberty</HI> hath hurt one Prince, the &s;mooth, deceitful Voice of <HI>Flattery,</HI> hath de&s;troy'd a Thou&s;and.&mdash;<HI>Charnock, King,</HI> and <HI>Keys,</HI> (tho&s;e execrable Con&s;pirators again&s;t our im|mortal Deliverer, King <HI>William</HI>) were not &s;o dangerous as a <HI>Mini&s;ter,</HI> who endeavours to per&s;uade his Prince, that every Piece of <HI>extra-mini&s;terial Advice,</HI> is an Arraignment of his Conduct; and that all <HI>Information from</HI> private <HI>Per|&s;ons</HI> reflects upon his <HI>own Circum&s;pection.</HI></P>
<P>Upon reading over the <HI>Arret</HI> again&s;t the <HI>forty Advocates,</HI> who have lately made an Attempt to revive the Power of the Parliaments of <HI>France,</HI> I cannot help thinking, that <HI>our Author</HI> had a Sight of it, before it was publi&s;h'd, and made it the Model of his Ob&s;ervations; for it is ob&s;erva|ble, that They <HI>both</HI> run in the <HI>&s;ome Style;</HI> and that the Principles of <HI>Liberty,</HI> which They condemn, are not very unlike.&mdash;The&s;e <HI>Lawyers,</HI> for In&s;tance, a&s;&s;ert, that, <HI>by the Con&s;titution of the Kingdom, the</HI> Parliaments <HI>are the Se|nate of the Nation;</HI> the <HI>&s;overeign Tribunal,</HI> and <HI>Depo&s;itories of the Laws of the State;</HI> that They have the <HI>Repre&s;entative Character of the publick Authority;</HI> and that the LAWS <HI>are true Conventions between Tho&s;e, who</HI> govern, <HI>and Tho&s;e, who are</HI> governed &mdash;The&s;e Doctrines are call'd, in the <HI>Ar|ret, A criminal Attempt to le&s;&s;en the Re&s;pect of</HI> the People, <HI>for the King's Supreme Authority; &s;editious; and tending to di&s;turb the publick Tranquility.</HI> For this Rea&s;on, the <HI>Pam|phlet,</HI> in which the&s;e pernicious Principles are contain'd, is order'd to be torn in Pieces; Mr. <HI>Lottin,</HI> the Printer (who &s;eems to be the <HI>Francklin</HI> of <HI>France</HI>) is commanded
<PB N="21" REF="20">
to produce the <HI>Written Copy;</HI> and the <HI>forty Advocates,</HI> who have &s;ub&s;cribed it, have a Month allow'd them to &s;ign a <HI>formal Recantation;</HI> in Default of which, They are to be &s;u&s;pended from all their <HI>Functions,</HI> and left to the <HI>farther Rigour</HI> and <HI>Severity of the Law,</HI> as the Importance of the Matter requires.</P>
<P>I need not draw any farther Parallel between this <HI>Arret</HI> and the <HI>Ob&s;ervations</HI> of our Author. The Reader will ea&s;ily perceive that <HI>Authority</HI> &s;upplies the want of <HI>Argu|ment</HI> in Both; and that the <HI>Principles of Liberty</HI> are repre|&s;ented de&s;tructive of <HI>Government</HI> and the <HI>publick Tran|quility.</HI></P>
<P>The only Pa&s;&s;age, in this <HI>empty labour'd Declamation,</HI> which &s;eems to have any Meaning or De&s;ign, be&s;ides <HI>Flattery</HI> and <HI>Abu&s;e,</HI> is That, where the Author endea|vours to fix a Contradiction upon the <HI>Craft&s;man.</HI> He charges Mr. <HI>D' Anvers</HI> with having &s;aid <HI>that the Spirit of</HI> Liberty <HI>and the Spirit of</HI> Fiction NEVER <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;t together;</HI> and yet that, in the <HI>Craft&s;man</HI> of <HI>October the</HI> 3d, it is &s;aid, in Relation to the Ca&s;e of the <HI>Yorki&s;ts</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;trians, though each Side contended to have a King of their own, nei|ther Party would have a</HI> Tyrant. <HI>They &s;acrificed their Lives to</HI> Faction, <HI>but would not give up their</HI> Liberties.</P>
<P>Upon which, this <HI>exqui&s;ite Rea&s;oner</HI> makes the following Ob&s;ervation.&mdash;<HI>This &s;ure demon&s;trates that the Spirit of</HI> FACTION <HI>did reign, even among the&s;e Champions for</HI> LIBER|TY.&mdash;And who, I pray, ever deny'd it?&mdash;I am &s;ure the <HI>Craft&s;man</HI> and his Friend Mr. <HI>Oldca&s;tle,</HI> have of|ten made this Ob&s;ervation; particularly in the very Pa|per, from whence our Author hath taken this Pa&s;&s;age; it is directly &s;aid that <HI>We mu&s;t not imagine, notwith&s;tand|ing all the contrary Appearances in this Period, that the Spirit of</HI> Liberty <HI>was ab&s;olutely extingui&s;h'd. Though</HI> that Flame <HI>was lo&s;t, for the mo&s;t Part, in the con&s;tant Glare of</HI> Faction, <HI>yet it was &s;till alive; and, by living, pre&s;erved the Con&s;titution of our Government during the whole Cour&s;e of the&s;e</HI> Civil Wars.</P>
<P>Nay, to expo&s;e the Sophi&s;try of this Author &s;till far|ther; the <HI>Ob&s;ervation,</HI> which He in&s;tances, as a Proof of the <HI>Craft&s;man</HI>'s <HI>Self-contradiction,</HI> is introduc'd in that very Paper, from whence He quotes it, as a memorable EX|CEPTION to the general Propo&s;ition, <HI>that the Spirit of</HI> Liberty <HI>and the Spirit of</HI> Faction <HI>are incompatible and cannot</HI> LONG <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;t together.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="22" REF="21">I do not remember any A&s;&s;ertion of the <HI>Craft&s;man</HI> tha$ a <HI>Spirit of</HI> Liberty <HI>and a Spirit of</HI> Faction NEVER <HI>&s;ub&s;i&s;$ together.</HI> I apprehend, on the Contrary, that the De&s;ig$ of his Argument for keeping up the <HI>Spirit of Liberty</HI> is to defeat the Ends of a <HI>Spirit of Faction.</HI></P>
<P>But &s;uch a Cavil as This, does not de&s;erve a &s;erious An|&s;wer; and I &s;hould have taken no manner of Notice o$ it, if it had not been the <HI>only Point,</HI> which bears the lea&s;$ Appearance of Rea&s;oning, or even of an Objection a|gain&s;t the <HI>Writings of the Craft&s;man.</HI></P>
<P>To treat this Subject in a familiar Light; I take <HI>Fac|tion,</HI> to be a well-looking, rantipole Strumpet; who hap|pening to re&s;emble <HI>Liberty,</HI> in &s;ome Features, takes upon her to per&s;onate the virtuous Lady; as &s;ome Gentlewo|men of the Town have done Maids of Honour. She affects her Dre&s;s, Mein and Voice; often frequents the &s;ame Walks, and &s;ometimes gets into the &s;ame Company which is a plain Sign that the fair <HI>Lady,</HI> whom &s;he repre|&s;ents, mu&s;t be very amiable Her&s;elf; but though the Jade may draw in a <HI>Cully now and then,</HI> there is no In|&s;tance of her having ever impos'd on the <HI>whole Town.</HI></P>
<P>To &s;um up the <HI>Author</HI>'s whole Evidence, it appears that this &s;ame <HI>Craft&s;man,</HI> not having the Fear of God before his Eyes, hath wickedly plotted the De&s;truction of the <HI>Mini&s;ter;</HI> and, proceeding in a Cour&s;e of <HI>guarde$ Trea&s;ons,</HI> is guilty of <HI>legal Con&s;piracy</HI> again&s;t the pre&s;ent Government, by preaching up the <HI>Principles of the Revo|lution,</HI> and putting the People in mind of their ancient <HI>hereditary Liberties;</HI> that He hath for the&s;e four Years pa&s;t, carried on an helli&s;h De&s;ign of excluding the pre|&s;ent <HI>Royal Family,</HI> by con&s;tantly a&s;&s;erting their Right; and of introducing <HI>Popery</HI> and the <HI>Pretender,</HI> by <HI>continual|ly delaring again&s;t them.</HI> In &s;hort, that He is a <HI>Republican</HI> Advocate for the <HI>pre&s;ent Con&s;titution;</HI> a <HI>Popi&s;h Whig;</HI> an <HI>Hanoverian Jacobite;</HI> and in all Probability, the &s;ecret Director of the <HI>Incendiaries</HI> at <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI></P>
<P>What can be done with &s;uch a mi&s;chievous and de&s;|perate Fellow:&mdash;He is &s;o much <HI>inur'd to the Danger of</HI> HANGING, that to be &s;ure He does not value an Halter a Straw; and our <HI>Laws</HI> are &s;o &s;trait-lac'd, that They will not allow us to deal with Him, as his <HI>&s;editious Brethren</HI> have been dealt with in <HI>Frnace.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="23" REF="22">But as all extraordinary Ca&s;es require extraoadinary Methods of Proceeding, I wonder our <HI>Author</HI> did not propo&s;e that all the Books, Pamphlets and Papers, which this <HI>wicked Incendiary</HI> hath di&s;pers'd, &s;hould be carry'd to the <HI>Secretary of State's Office,</HI> to be torn in Pieces; that <HI>Richard Franklin,</HI> the Printer, &s;hall be oblig'd to produce the <HI>written Copies,</HI> (if He hath not already burnt them;) and that <HI>Caleb D' Anvers</HI> &s;hall, within the Space of one Month, &s;ign a formal Retractation of all his pernicious Tenets; and &s;ubmit Him&s;elf to the <HI>new Con&s;titution</HI> of <HI>this Author</HI> and his <HI>Patron; That</HI> (as Duke <HI>Trincalo</HI> &s;ays) <HI>the Government may be &s;uffer'd to drink in Quiet.</HI></P>
