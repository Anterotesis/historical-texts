<P>How now, noble Captain Killmallock?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wonder if the ingenious gentleman, that fir&s;t hit upon digging, tried it with as plea&s;ant a broiling &s;un over his head, as we have&mdash;By my &s;oul, if he went to work with his jacket on, it would have warmed it pretty decently.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>We are &s;laves, Kilmallock, and mu&s;t &s;ubmit, but we are &s;oldiers of Spain, chri&s;tian &s;oldiers, both our faith and our profe&s;&s;ion, when providence inflicts calamity preach pati|ence to us, murmurs are fruitle&s;s brother &s;oldier, the &s;ickle godde&s;s, Fortune, hears not the complaining of the grief worn captive.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, now, Count Virolet I always under&s;tood the good lady was blind, but I was never before told &s;he was dunny, faith and that I take to be the rea&s;on &s;he has never been good natured enough to li&s;ten&mdash;when I have reminded her what a dirty devil &s;he has been to me, fir&s;t I was to&s;ted out of Tippera|ry into Spain, where I have fought the&s;e &s;even years under Ferdinand, the fifth King of Ca&s;tile, and Arragon, till the thumps be&s;towed on me by his Catholic maje&s;ty's enemies, (and be hanged to them) have b$laboured up to the rank of a captai$.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Right, of Calatrava, of which gallant order I boa&s;t my&s;$lf a member.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, and you may boa&s;t, for my part I never had the knack of it&mdash;but I have had the honor, &s;ignior of fighting &s;ide by &s;$de, with you; again&s;t the Moors of Grenada, there.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>And bravely too, good comrade.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Alli!&mdash;one for that, well now I have the honour of being locked up with you, in the gardens of an old whi&s;ker faced Arabian, we have been pri&s;oners the&s;e three months, and here are a pretty pair of famous knights, that boa&s;t them&s;elves of the gallant Order of Calatrava, with a bit of a &s;hovel popt into their noble hands, digging away like two planters of potatoes.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yet comfort thee Killmallock, Grenada is clo&s;ely be|&s;ieged, our royal ma&s;ter Ferdinand, has rai&s;ed, and fortified a
<PB N="4" REF="4">
town near to their walls, 'tis as I hear, a well &s;tock'd hive of war, terming with clo&s;e compacted &s;warms of &s;oldiery, who will &s;o buz about their Moor&s;hips ears; yea, and &s;o &s;ting the&s;e &s;treak &s;kinned mu&s;&s;$lmen, that they will &s;mart to death with it. Noble comrade, prove but their arms &s;ucce&s;sful, and 'twill cut aroad to freedom for us. Yet that's doubtful, there were in|deed a &s;horter way.</P>
<STAGE>(mu&s;ing.)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oh! then let's be after trudging, that if there are two roads out of captivity, I am always for travelling the &s;horte&s;t cut, becau&s;e it bids fair to be the neare&s;t.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Come, I will tru&s;t thee, I do know thee brave, and in the brea&s;t, where fire-ey'd courage rears her rugged throne, &s;ure honor mu&s;t inhabit! yet dare I tru&s;t thee?</P>
<STAGE>(con&s;idering)</STAGE>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Dare you! look'ye Count Virolet, you dare do much, for you are the fir&s;t that ever dare tell me to my teeth, he held my honour in doubt&mdash;Oh! fire and ounds, and &s;aint Dominick to boot. Hark'ye, Sir Don, I was never a hunter after other men's &s;ecrets, as I am not over fond of keeping what does not belong to me, but I am an Iri&s;hman, mark you me, born a &s;ub|ject to his Engli&s;h maje&s;ty, heaven pro&s;per the king, and country to the end of time, and if any Spaniard, Frenchman, or el&s;e|where touch upon our honors, by my &s;oul, we'll fillip 'em &s;ound|dly for daring to call it in que&s;tion.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Friend, were the merits of thy nation &s;cann'd from one particular, and thou the &s;ample, I &s;hould affirm thy coun+trymen all heart, &s;tuff'd with &s;uch manly qualities, that it doth grievou&s;ly perplex their heads, when to find &s;it &s;ea&s;ons for exerci|&s;ing them. He that doth take offence before 'tis meant, isin him|&s;elf o&s;&s;$nding, Sir, it dwelt not within my thoughts to anger you.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>If you did not give me a &s;hake of your Spani&s;h fi&s;t, &s;ignior. I intreat your pardon. Be&s;trew me count, but I am as far from giving an offence wrong&s;ully, as I am from taking one, and as I am the &s;ample you talk of, mark down this for my, countrymen, if it plea&s;e you, if my head mi&s;chances to run it&s;elf in the dark again&s;t the &s;eelings of another, my heart bids me go thro' fire and water, for his &s;ervice, by way of reparation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>The &s;pirit of thy warm and kindly nation, &s;hines thro' thy &s;peech, rough &s;oldier, hear me comrade! thou knowe&s;t the governor.</P>

<P>What, the Moor, Bulcazin Mul$y? our ma&s;ter, as he calls him&s;elf. an arrant old.&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Your patience, this &s;ame Moor who holds us captives, has one fair daughter, beauties parragon; each evening as the &s;un begins to &s;ink, behind the mountains top, in yonder tower
<PB N="5" REF="5">
&s;he &s;its, and in a &s;imple mournful ditty, pours forth a &s;train of native melody, that doth enchant the ravi&s;hed hearers &s;oul, out warbling Philomel.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>And certainly an afternoon's &s;ong is a mighty pretty refre&s;hment, for a jontleman who has been turning up the mould for eight hours together, But for the life of me now, I can|not think how it will give him &s;trength to &s;queeze thr'o the for|tifications of Grenada.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Briefly, to Zorayda am I &s;worn, and &s;he fair &s;oul to me, &s;ome t$o mo$hs back, worn with fatigue and leaning on my &s;pade in pen&s;ive &s;ort under the Cork-tree boughs, that wave beneath the &s;ullen turrets window, a female hand &s;tretched out thro' the let|tice-work let &s;all a letter to me, thus it ran&mdash;<Q>&startq;I am at heaart a chri&s;tian, from the &s;laves you have I &s;ingled out.&endq;</Q>&mdash;bear me from hence, then fortune and Zorayda are your own."</P>

<P>Och! the crater.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Viro.</SPEAKER>
<P>Oft to her window have I &s;tole at du&s;k, when from the tower a &s;ilken cord has dropt, and thus in mute exchange, we have convey'd our written vows, for &s;peech were dangerous. Her Fa|ther, chief about the Moori&s;h king, holds the town keys in charge.</P>

</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Kil.</SPEAKER>
<P>Faith, Count Virolet, and you have cho&s;en as hand&s;omly as heart can de&s;ire, for the &s;ervice of a fair lady, or a &s;mall mat|ter of fighting, you may &s;earch the world over before you will find any better prepared than an Iri&s;hman.</P>
