<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>THUS far in &s;afety&mdash;all's hu&s;h&mdash;our &s;ubtle air of France quickens not the temperament of the enemy&mdash;the&s;e phlegmatic Engli&s;h &s;nore out the night in as gro&s;s, as when their &s;en&s;es &s;tagnate in their own native fogs, where &s;tupor lies like lead upon them, which the mu$$y rogues call &s;leep; we have nearly pa&s;s'd the entrench|ments&mdash;La Gloire.</P>

<P>My Lord?</P>

<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where did you direct our mariners to meet us with the boat?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Marry, I told them to meet us with the boat at the &s;ea-&s;hore.</P>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Vague booby&mdash;at what point?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<PB N="2" REF="4">
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's the point I was coming to&mdash;and if a certain jutting out of land, in the &s;hape of a white clift, with brown furze on its top, like a bu&s;hy head of hair over a pale face, &s;tands where it did&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ea&s;t of the town, I have mark'd it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>To &s;ee now the difference of men&mdash;what I have hunted after a whole day to fix upon, hath he noted without labour&mdash;oh the capacious heads of our great officers&mdash;no wonder they are &s;o careful of them in battle, and thru&s;t forward the pitiful pates of the privates, to be mowed off, like a parcel of dai&s;ies&mdash;but there lies the &s;pot, and there will the mariners come&mdash;we are now within ear-&s;hot, and when they are there, they will whi&s;tle.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>And till they give the &s;ignal, here, if there is ought of &s;afety to be pick'd from danger, is the lea&s;t dangerous &s;pot to tarry for them&mdash;we are here full early.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>I would we were not here at all, this &s;ame &s;cheme of victualling a town, blockaded by the enemy, is a &s;ervice for which I have little appetite.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Think, La Gloire, of the di&s;tre&s;s of the in|habitants, our countrymen peri&s;hing with hunger.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Truly, &s;ir, it moves the bowels of my compa&s;&s;ion; yet con&s;ider the ri&s;que, con&s;ider your rank the gallant Count Ribemont, flower of Chi|valry, cream of the French army, turned cook to the corporation of Calais, carving his way to glory, through &s;tubble rump'd capons, un&s;kinn'd mutton, raw veal, and vegetables; and perhaps, my Lord, before we are able to &s;erve up the meat to the town, in comes a raw-bon'd Engli&s;hman, and runs his &s;pit through your body.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Prithee no more objections.</P>

<SP>
<PB N="3" REF="5">
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>Nay, I object! not I&mdash;but I have &s;erv'd your honor, in, and out of the army, babe, boy, and man, the&s;e five and twenty years, come the next fea&s;t of the Virgin, and heaven forefend, I &s;hould be out of &s;ervice, by being out of my ma&s;ter.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Well, well, I know thy zeal.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And yet your Engli&s;h rapier is a mar|vellous &s;udden di&s;&s;olver of attachments&mdash;'twill &s;ever the clo&s;e&s;t connections&mdash;'twill even whip you for ever, friend head, from his intimate ac|quaintances, neck and &s;houlders, before they have time to take leave, not that I object&mdash;yet men do not always &s;leep; the fat centinel, as we pa&s;s'd the out-po&s;t, might have woke with his own &s;noring&mdash;and&mdash;</P>

<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>Peace! remember your duty to me,&mdash;to your country&mdash;and yet alas, I mock my&s;elf to name it&mdash;did not tho&s;e rugged battlements of Calais, that tomb, yet &s;afeguard of its citizens, which &s;huts the &s;word out, and locks hunger in, (where many a wretch, pale, gaunt, and famine-&s;truck, &s;miles gha&s;tly at the &s;laughterous threat and dies) cla&s;ping &s;weet beauty's queen&mdash;encircled now within their cold and ponderous embrace, the fair yet ah! I fear the fickle Julia, thy &s;luggi&s;h zeal, would &s;lack the power to rou&s;e it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>And of all the &s;purs in the race of mor|tality, love is the only true tickler to quicken a man's motions; but to reconcile a mi&s;tre&s;s by victualling a town! well, dark and puzzling is the road to woman's affections&mdash;but this is the fir&s;t time I ever heard of &s;liding into her heart, through the palate, or choaking her anger, by &s;topping her mouth with a meal&mdash;an' this pantry fa&s;hion of wooing &s;hould la&s;t, woe to the ill fa|vour'd.
<PB N="4" REF="6">
&mdash;Beauty will rai&s;e the price of provi&s;ions, and poor ugline&s;s will &s;oon be &s;tarved out of the country.</P>

<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>This enterprize may yet regain her&mdash;once &s;he was kind, until her father's policy, nou|ri&s;h'd in courts, &s;tept in, and check'd her love: yet 'twas not love, for <HI>true</HI> love knows no check&mdash;there is no &s;kill in Cupid's archery, when duty heals a love wound.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>La Gl.</SPEAKER>
<P>No, truly, nor is &s;he likely, while he provides her with entertainment; true love's groans are be&s;t nouri&s;h'd by fa&s;ting; but dear my Lord, think on the great danger, and little repu|tation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Rib.</SPEAKER>
<P>No more; mark me, La Gloire; as your officer, I may command you onward, but in re|&s;pect to your early attachment, your faithful &s;ervice ere you follow'd me to the army, if your mind mi&s;gives you in this undertaking, you have my leave to retreat.</P>

Oft has he put you to't&mdash;nay late at Cre&s;&s;y; a&s;k of your Black Prince Edward there, how long Count Ribemont and he were point to point; he has attacked our foe, relieved our people, &s;uccoured our town, 'till cruel di&s;appointment, where he had fixed his gallant heart, did turn him wild, with de&s;pairing love. Old John De Vienne re|fu&s;ed his daughter to him, drove him hither to meet your cruelty&mdash;and now that daughter, grown de&s;perate as he, doth brave it, and we will die together.</P>
