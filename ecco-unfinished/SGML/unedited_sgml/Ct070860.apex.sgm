<HEAD TYPE="sub"><HI>OBADIAH</HI> a Friend to Truth and Peace, to thee <HI>John Eriskine,</HI> called <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> a Ma&s;ter of Sedition, and a Leader of the Wicked among the People,</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>Leteth to Wot,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THAT, howbeit, thou art of the Number of tho&s;e who are ex|alted to high Degree in the Earth, and that Honour is given to thee of Men; yet fora&s;much as thou art greatly degenerated from that, which
<PB N="4" REF="3">
even by vulgar Men is e&s;teem'd honoura|ble, and ha&s;t offended again&s;t him that is greater than thee; it behoveth that I re|buke thee in the Ears of the People, al|beit I am but a mean Man; for Truth lo|&s;eth nothing of its Efficacy and Force by the Meanne&s;s of the Per&s;on, or the Plain|ne&s;s of the Language, by which it is held forth.</P>
<P>For I &s;ignify to thee, Lord <HI>Mar,</HI> that this Per&s;on who now writeth unto thee, hath been accu&s;tomed to &s;peak even to the Princes and great Men of the Earth, Words of Reproof, as oft as they do Evil, and that without re&s;pect of the Favour, or Fear of the Wrath of Man; fora&s;much as I have learned not to fear the Face of Man, or to bow before him.</P>
<P>Nay, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> but it is an Evil Re|port that I hear of thee, <HI>to wit</HI> that thou ha&s;t levyed War again&s;t thy Lord the King, and gathering the Elders of thy People together, ha&s;t lifted up thy Hand again&s;t thy Rulers, taking the Sword of Offence into thy unrighteous Hand, where|with thou art bold to do Evil, to &s;mite with the Fi&s;t of Wickedne&s;s, and to bring innocent Blood upon thy Land, and up|on thine own Head.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="4">
I would that thou &s;houlde&s;t &s;ee the Evil of thy Doings, before it be too late, and before Vengeance overtake thee, le&s;t thou &s;uffer as an Evil doer; for ve|rily thou can&s;t not pro&s;per in this Thing, and he that doth righteou&s;ly, will call thee to an account therefore.</P>
<P>Wherefore, I coun&s;el thee, to look back upon thy Ways, and lay hold on the Clemency and Mercy of the King be|fore it be too late; neither will I threat|en thee with the Vengeance of Men, un|le&s;s thou per&s;i&s;t ob&s;tinately in thy Offen|ces; for verily our Lord the King is willing to &s;hew Mercy, and hath pro|claimed Mercy to Rebels, and even to tho&s;e who have lifted up their Hands a|gain&s;t him, if they &s;hall &s;hew their Re|pentance, by &s;uch Tokens of Submi&s;&s;ion, as Ju&s;tice and Truth &s;hall require.</P>
<P>Verily, Friend <HI>John,</HI> I would that thou &s;houlde&s;t repent, and that thou &s;houlde&s;t return to thy due State of Obedience to the Rulers of thy People; for &s;urely this Thing is not of the Lord, neither &s;halt thou pro&s;per therein. Well I wot, that thou flattere&s;t thy &s;elf with vain Thoughts,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
and &s;aye&s;t to the People that it is not Re|bellion when thou lifte&s;t up thy Hand a|gain&s;t the King; fora&s;much as thou pre|tende&s;t to have a Per&s;on on thy Side, who, as thou &s;aye&s;t, is of the hou&s;e of the Kings, howbeit he is really a Stranger, and an Out-ca&s;t, rejected of God, and of the People of the Land, and of whom the General Voice of the Nation hath &s;aid, <HI>We will not have this Man to reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>Neither is it &s;ufficient for thee to &s;ay, that he is the Offspring of the Royal Tribe, to whom the Lord hath &s;aid, that the Scepter &s;hould not depart therefrom; &s;ee|ing our Lord the King is likewi&s;e the Son of the Kings, and moreover, cho&s;en of God from among his Brethren; like as <HI>David</HI> the Son of <HI>Je&s;&s;e</HI> was the Anointed of the Lord, notwith&s;tanding his &s;even Brethren, the Sons of his Father, were elder than he. Flatter not then thy &s;elf, O weak Man, that the Right of this Stranger can be of more Weight than his whom the Lord hath cho&s;en; &s;eeing the God of Kings has often given us to under&s;tand, that the Right, which is called vulgarly Hereditary, is not under&s;tood in Heaven as thou woulde&s;t per&s;wade Men to under|&s;tand it, but that every Branch of the Roy|al Tribe has an Equality of Claim, when
<PB N="7" REF="6">
God, either by him&s;elf, or by the Voice of the People of the Land, &s;hall &s;ingle out from the re&s;t, the Per&s;ons who he hath before determined to Reign, as has been e|vident, even in the Throne of <HI>I&s;rael,</HI> which was &s;o immediately directed from God; wherein, not <HI>David</HI> only was cho|&s;en before his elder Brethren, as afore&s;aid, but <HI>Solomon,</HI> who was the younger Son of many, was appointed his Succe&s;&s;or, and Reign'd by Hereditary Right after him.</P>
<P>I forbear to &s;peak with thee, concerning the &s;uppo&s;ed Fraud of the Per&s;on who calls her &s;elf the Mother of thy pretended Ma&s;ter, which hath prevailed with many to believe he was not the Son of her Womb; and this I do, becau&s;e it matter|eth not unto us whether he were &s;o, or whether he were otherwi&s;e; &s;eeing the Lord hath rejected his Father's hou&s;e, and ca&s;t him out before the People; where|fore the Land &s;pued him out, and hath &s;aid, <HI>Let him be ca&s;t out for ever.</HI></P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, thou ha&s;t gain&s;aid the Word of the Lord, and ha&s;t made Pro|clamation, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> That this Stranger &s;hall be King in the Land, and that the Uncir|cumcis'd &s;hall Reign. Verily, <HI>John,</HI> thou
<PB N="8" REF="7">
merite&s;t to be puni&s;hed by the Judge, and when the King cometh to execute Judg|ment with the Sword, thou &s;halt not be able to &s;tand before him, and not only thy Blood, but the Blood of the People that are with thee &s;hall be upon thy head. Truly, thou ha&s;t deluded the People to their hurt in this Matter, and ha&s;t drawn them into a Snare, to Rebel&punc; again&s;t God and the King, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> That thou had&s;t ma|ny Adherents in the Land, and that di|vers other Per&s;ons, <HI>Vain Men among the People</HI> would &s;tand up with thee, and then thou &s;houlde&s;t prevail over the King: But herein thou ha&s;t deceived thy &s;elf, and tho&s;e that are with thee; fora&s;much as many of thy Friends are already fallen in|to the Hands of the King, others are di&s;|per&s;ed, &s;cattered, and made afraid, fly|ing from the Hands of Ju&s;tice, and wan|dring in a &s;trange Land for Safety.</P>
<P>Wherefore, Friend <HI>John,</HI> I &s;hall not Expo&s;tulate with thee upon the Sin of thy Ways, and the Wickedne&s;s of thy Rebel|lion; for <HI>I wot</HI> that thou wilt not be brought to acknowledge thy Offence. But I &s;hall &s;peak to thee, after the manner of Men, de&s;iring thee to weigh and con&s;ider thy Ways, and, like the wi&s;e Man that
<PB N="9" REF="8">
maketh War, con&s;ider whether thou, with thy ten Thou&s;ands art able to deal with him who Commandeth again&s;t thee with twenty Thou&s;ands; and whether while thou art fighting with Impo&s;&s;ibilities and impracticable Things, thou art not ca&s;t|ing thy &s;elf away, and leading all tho&s;e that are with thee into De&s;truction.</P>
<P>For thinke&s;t thou, <HI>vain Man,</HI> that thou, with the Rabbles of thy Mountaineers whom thou ha&s;t gathered together in the Naughtine&s;s of thy Heart, and ha&s;t flat|tered with the hopes of Spoil, &s;hall be a|ble to with&s;tand the Powers which are ga|thered again&s;t thee from all the Corners of the Land? Or do&s;t thou per&s;wade thy &s;elf, that thou art able to contend with the King, who&s;e Armies are now gather|ing round thee to devour thee?</P>
<P>Let me examine for thee, <HI>Friend John,</HI> the Strength whereon thou do&s;t lean, and the Confidence wherewith thou art puffed up I for I give thee to under&s;tand, that I am well acquainted with thy De&s;ign, and I well under&s;tand the broken Staff <HI>of Lor|rain,</HI> on which thou leane&s;t thy Hand, and how thou art deceived thereby, and
<PB N="10" REF="9">
deceive&s;t tho&s;e of the People who are gone forth with thee.</P>
<P>I think, <HI>Friend John,</HI> thy vain Ex|pectations may be reduced to three Kinds, to wit, tho&s;e which thou ha&s;t from thy Confederates abroad, tho&s;e which thou ha&s;t flattered thy &s;elf with form &s;ome who are Traytors to the King in this Part of the Land, which is called <HI>England;</HI> and la&s;tly, the Strength of thy own Intere&s;t among the People of the Hills, and of the Mountains whom thou ha&s;t deceived, and with whom thou ha&s;t deceived thy &s;elf; <HI>&s;aying,</HI> That the&s;e &s;hall deliver thee, and that the&s;e &s;hall bring thee forth to Battle again&s;t the People of our Lord the King.</P>
<P>But I mu&s;t deal plainly with thee, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> for thou art deceived herein, nei|ther art thou able to &s;tand in the Battle, or to &s;hew thy &s;elf in the high Places of the Field; for that every part of this thy Confidence will fail, and thou &s;halt be for&s;aken of all thy Helpers, and &s;hall be delivered up into the Hands of thy Ene|mies, and there &s;hall be none to &s;ave thee.</P>
<P><PB N="11" REF="10">
And that I may &s;hew thee this thing in time, it &s;hall be told thee how it &s;tandeth with thy Helpers, and with tho&s;e who have &s;tricken Hands with thee in this Thing, who&s;e Condition&punc; perhaps thou knowe&s;t not; or if thou do&s;t, I am in|formed thou conceale&s;t the &s;ame from the People who are with thee; who therefore thou art ju&s;tly &s;aid to have deceived, and to have drawn in, to their Hurt, they not knowing what they do.</P>
<P>True it is, that when thou fir&s;t concei|ved this Evil in thy Heart, thou wa&s;t en|couraged to expect Help from the Mighty, and the Kings of the <HI>Gentiles (Roman Ca|tholicks)</HI> had laid a Confederacy with thee, and with the Stranger, for whom thou fighte&s;t, and in who&s;e Name thou ha&s;t done this Wickedne&s;s: But thou art not ignorant, how that one of the&s;e &s;aid Kings who was the mo&s;t Mighty among the Heathen, and yet who gave him&s;elf a great Name, <HI>to wit,</HI> of MOST CHRISTIAN, has been &s;natch'd from his Throne by one more Mightier than he, and is &s;lept with his Fathers, and they have buried him in the Sepulchre of his Fathers, and he is no more: Moreover, thou knowe&s;t that the
<PB N="12" REF="11">
King that is ri&s;en up after him is but a Child, and knowe&s;t not Good from E|vil, and that the Governors of the &s;aid King are not Friends to thy Enterprize, or to the Ma&s;ter whom thou &s;erve&s;t; but that the Fear of our Lord the King is upon them, and they are as Men that have no Life before him; wherefore they think Evil towards thee, neither will they &s;end Help to thee, as in Times pa&s;t: Like|wi&s;e the other King of the Neighbouring Country, who is al&s;o call'd THE CA|THOLICK, and who has laid a Confe|deracy, as above&s;aid, Behold, is he not a|far off? Neither hath he any Ships, or any Strength wherewith to a&s;&s;i&s;t thee; but his Hands are cut off, and al&s;o he is unable to give any A&s;&s;i&s;tance unto thee, albeit he may have promi&s;ed thee fair.</P>
<P>The re&s;t of thy Confidence is placed, as I am informed, in A&s;&s;i&s;tances of Money, and the&s;e, <HI>Friend John,</HI> thou knowe&s;t are but poor, and few, and not at all propor|tion'd, or able to &s;upport &s;uch a va&s;t and unbounded De&s;ign as thou art engag'd in; neither are the Per&s;ons from whom they are &s;aid to come able long to &s;upply thee. <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> It hath been &s;aid, that thou ha&s;t received certain pieces of Silver from the Charita|ble
<PB N="13" REF="12">
Collections made among the Societies of Idolatrous Prie&s;ts. It &s;eemeth to me, that the&s;e wicked Men's depending upon, is, that thy Ma&s;ter purpo&s;es to re&s;tore their Idolatry in the&s;e Kingdoms, and that he will execute their Bloody and Per|&s;ecuting Principles on the Inhabitants thereof, planting the Religious Tyranny of their Prie&s;ts in this Land) a Yoke which neither we, or our Fathers were a|ble to bear) have opened their Pur&s;es to him, and contributed certain Sums of Con|&s;ecrated Silver for that u&s;e.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, <HI>Secondly,</HI> It hath been told us, that the ARCH-PRIEST, whom thou knowe&s;t, <HI>Friend John</HI> to be the Son of Perdition, and who the People of the Lord believe to be that <HI>Scarlet Whore,</HI> who bewitcheth the Nations with her Whore|doms, and whom the Lord &s;hall de&s;troy in the latter Day; I &s;ay, it hath been told us, that this ARCH-PRIEST hath di&s;tri|buted of that Money which they call the Trea&s;ures of the Church unto thy Ma&s;ter, and has dedicated the &s;ame to the carrying on this Sedition, whereof thou calle&s;t thy &s;elf the Head; and that this is done, if it is at all &s;o, with a De&s;ign to &s;et on foot
<PB N="14" REF="13">
the Wickedne&s;s and Super&s;tition of Pope|ry, thou can'&s;t not be ignorant.</P>
<P>With what Confidence then can'&s;t thou, <HI>Friend John,</HI> who profe&s;&s;e&s;t thy &s;elf to be a Prote&s;tant, appear to take up the Sword of Rebellion and Sedition, and to Arm the People again&s;t the Lord? Ina&s;much as thou knowe&s;t thou art fighting for Po|pery, and endeavouring to bring back that Abomination of De&s;olation which our Fathers thru&s;t out? With what Face can'&s;t thou put thy Hand to &s;et again tho&s;e <HI>Plants which our Heavenly Father</HI> not only <HI>hath not planted,</HI> but which we know <HI>he had rooted up?</HI></P>
<P>And wherefore conceale&s;t thou the&s;e things from the Ears of the People which are with thee, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> Ye are for the Pro|te&s;tant Religion? Is it not known, and doth not thy own Con&s;cience reproach thee herewith, that thou ha&s;t taken up the Sword for a <HI>Popi&s;h Pretender,</HI> and that thou ha&s;t proclaimed it in the Ears of the People, <HI>&s;aying,</HI> That he is their King? And is it not known, that thou art &s;upported with Money, and Promi&s;es of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the &s;aid Popi&s;h Pretender, and from the ARCH-PRIEST of ROME, with
<PB N="15" REF="14">
whom is Idolatry, and divers kinds of Super&s;tition; who is drunk with the Blood of the Lord's People, and yet thir|&s;teth for more Blood, even the Blood of all the Good People of this Land?</P>
<P>But, alas, <HI>Friend John,</HI> What are all the&s;e able to do for thee? I would that thou &s;houlde&s;t know that they are not a|ble to &s;upport thee, or to &s;end thee &s;uch Supplies of Money as thy new Enterprize will call for; but will leave thee in the Lurch, and expo&s;e thee to the Fury, and to the Ju&s;tice of thy own People. For|a&s;much, <HI>Lord Marr,</HI> as thou knowe&s;t that it is not in them, neither have they Rich|es or Power &s;ufficient for thee, and thou wilt find, if thou wante&s;t a &s;econd Relief, that they are Poor, and not able; as like|wi&s;e Covetous and Narrow, and will not be willing to &s;end thee farther Sums, lea|ving thee to fall by the Power of thy E|nemies, and expo&s;ing both thee and thy Ma&s;ter to Mi&s;ery and Di&s;tre&s;s. For to tell thee the Truth, &s;uch is the Luxury and Vanity of this ARCH-PRIEST, and of his Dependents, that they cannot rai&s;e a|ny Sums of Money out of their Eccle&s;ia|&s;tick Revenues, equal to that Underta|king.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="15">
Having thus examin'd the Capacity of thy foreign Friends, and how unlikely it is, that thou &s;houlde&s;t be carried thro' this de&s;pe|rate Undertaking, by the feeble A&s;&s;i&s;tance of &s;uch People, Let me remind thee of one thing, which perhaps thou thinke&s;t not of, <HI>viz.</HI> Suppo&s;ing it were otherwi&s;e, and that the&s;e Heads of Idolatry were a|ble to carry thee on in thy wicked De&s;igns, <HI>What is the End which thou art aiming at?</HI> Is is not the Work of Satan that thou art carrying on? Is it not the Subver&s;ion of Religion it &s;elf that is in thy De&s;ign? Are not all thy Men Fighting again&s;t God? Kicking again&s;t the Pricks, and Embarked in the wor&s;t De&s;ign that e|ver Prote&s;tants were in Arms for be|fore?</P>
<P>Publi&s;h it not in <HI>Gath,</HI> let not the Un|circumci&s;ed Phili&s;tines <HI>(Papi&s;ts)</HI> hear the Sound of it. Search into the Hi&s;tory of thy Fathers, and look over the long Re|gi&s;ters of the Time pa&s;t, and tell us, <HI>Friend John,</HI> if ever Prote&s;tants took up the Sword of Popery before, e&s;pecially again&s;t the Intere&s;t of Prote&s;tants? We have read, that the Prote&s;tants in <HI>Hungary</HI> have even made u&s;e of the Sword of <HI>Mahomet</HI>
<PB N="17" REF="16">
again&s;t the Tyrants, and Idol Wor&s;hip|pers of <HI>Rome,</HI> but was it indeed to &s;et up the Super&s;tition of <HI>Mahomet?</HI> NAY, but was it not rather to pre&s;erve the Profe&s;&s;i|on and Practice of their own Principles in Religion again&s;t Popery? And &s;hall Briti&s;h Prote&s;tants Erect Popery by the Sword of Ruine? What Incon&s;i&s;tency art thou practi&s;ing, <HI>Lord Mar?</HI> And where will it end, but in thy De&s;truction?</P>
<P>On the other Hand, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> I ad|vi&s;e thee to call to mind, that thine is a Ca&s;e, in which it is hard for thee, <HI>even thee thy &s;elf,</HI> on the mature&s;t Con&s;iderati|on, to plea&s;e thy &s;elf in the Succe&s;s of thy Undertaking, if it &s;hould come to pa&s;s, a|ny more than in thy Mi&s;carriage; for that if thou mi&s;carry, thou art undone, and if thou &s;ucceed, thy Country, thy Fami|ly, thy Po&s;terity, and thy Religion are all undone; thy People made mi&s;era|ble, thy Fathers, and thy Children gi|ven up to the Enemy, and made a De|&s;olation for ever; <HI>&s;o that,</HI> if thou art in thy Sen&s;es, thou can'&s;t not wi&s;h even Succe&s;s to thy own De&s;igns, without mix|ing the Horror of thy Countrey's Ruine with the Thoughts of thy pretended Pro&s;|perity.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="17">
And is it not an Act of great Tenderne&s;s to thee then, in Friendlywi&s;e to admoni&s;h thee, that thou precipitate not thy &s;elf into this great Ruine and De&s;olation in thy pre&s;ent Attempt, and that thou make not thy &s;elf an In&s;trument, as far as lyeth in thy Power, to pull down the true Re|ligion in thy Native Country, and to &s;et up Popi&s;h Idolatry? And more e&s;pecial|ly am I thy Friend, in giving thee this Coun&s;el; fora&s;much as I &s;ee it is impo&s;&s;i|ble for thee to pro&s;per in thy De&s;igns, and that thy Friends in whom thou tru&s;t|e&s;t are too feeble to &s;upport thee.</P>
<P>But it hath al&s;o been &s;aid of thee, <HI>Friend John,</HI> that thou flattere&s;t thy &s;elf with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of evil Men, like thy &s;elf, even among the People of this our Land; and that thou ha&s;t hardened thy Countenance again&s;t the Truth, that thou maye&s;t de|ceive the Men that are with thee; <HI>&s;aying,</HI> That certain great Men in this part of our Land, which is called <HI>England,</HI> are like|wi&s;e A&s;&s;embled, and have drawn the Sword again&s;t the King. Now, albeit, <HI>Friend John,</HI> there are Sons of <HI>Belial</HI> a|mong the People, who are di&s;po&s;ed to do Evil, and who had Confederated toge|ther

<P>Send forth now thy Me&s;&s;engers, and let them &s;ee, and write to thy confederated Friends, and let them an&s;wer thee; where are now thy Helpers, who &s;aid unto thee, Verily, we will Smite the King, and tho&s;e that are with him?

Ha&s;t thou not heard how <HI>Edward Harvey,</HI> one of thy Ma&s;ter's wealthy Friends, ha|ving been taken in his own Craftine&s;s, has thro' Anger and Wrath fallen upon his own Knife, and &s;ore wounded him&s;elf, even almo&s;t to the Death?

See&s;t thou not likewi&s;e, that the whole Nation is pre&s;erved in Peace; and that again&s;t the King, or a|gain&s;t his Hou&s;e, not a Dog waggeth his Tongue? I coun&s;el thee then, to con&s;ider with thy &s;elf, to lay down the Sword of Strife and Sedition, and to &s;ubmit thy &s;elf to the King, &s;aying, <HI>Be merciful to me, O King!</HI> And howbeit thou ha&s;t not de|&s;erved it, yet doubtle&s;s thou &s;halt find Mercy; for our Rulers are al&s;o merciful.</P>

enured to Battle? Wherefore then, boa|&s;te&s;t thou thy &s;elf? And what art thou able to do? If thou thinke&s;t thy Hills and Mountains &s;hall defend thee, and the Rocks &s;hall defeat the Hor&s;emen of the King, to what Purpo&s;e then, art thou gathered together, &s;eeing thou wilt be be|&s;ieged therein, and thy Mountains &s;hall become a De&s;ert to thee, and to tho&s;e who are with thee? For, be it &s;o, that thou &s;houlde&s;t be able to defend the Fa&s;t|ne&s;&s;es of the Rocks, and to hide thy &s;elf in the Hollows of the Mountains, yet there remains a Que&s;tion for thee to give An&s;wer to, before the Sea&s;on of Winter which approaches, come upon thee; <HI>viz.</HI> Can thy Men feed upon the Rocks and Mountains?

Wherefore then, art thou deceiving thy &s;elf, and tho&s;e that are gathered together about thee? If thou art a Man of War, why come&s;t not thou forth to the Bat|tle, and why do&s;t thou not &s;how thy &s;elf? Verily, thou art deceived to thy Hurt; for thou art not able to &s;tand: Thy Hopes are in vain, and thou wilt fall in this thy Wickedne&s;s, neither will any one pity thee, but thou wilt die as an evil Per&s;on, and as a Worker of Wick|edne&s;s.</P>
<P>But Friend <HI>John,</HI> let me yet rea&s;on with thee of this Matter, even of the Hopes which thou ha&s;t entertained of Succe&s;s in thy Folly. Were it rea&s;ona|ble to &s;uppo&s;e that thou &s;houlde&s;t fight with the Servants of the King who are now a&s;&s;embled again&s;t thee, and that thou &s;houlde&s;t prevail (for their Number is not yet great) what would &s;uch little Victory avail thee, but to puff up thy Heart with Pride, and cau&s;e thee to fall into greater Offences, that thou may'&s;t be ripened for farther Vengeance? for verily the &s;mall Number of the Soldiers who are yet &s;ent again&s;t thee, and which perhaps encourages thee in thy Ways,
<PB N="25" REF="24">
ought rather to weaken thy hands, by &s;hewing what Contempt of thy Power the Servants of the King have in their Hearts, knowing that thou mu&s;t likewi&s;e encoun|ter greater and more powerful Bands, even in every Step of thy Progre&s;s; for that thou can&s;t not expect that the Mea&s;ure of Power is to be taken from tho&s;e that are now a&s;&s;embled again&s;t thee, in which it is to be &s;aid, that thou ha&s;t gathered thy whole Power together already; but the Armies of our King, who are now bu&s;ied in ruining and cru&s;hing the Seeds of Re|bellion which thy Pretending Ma&s;ter has &s;owed in this Nation, will encrea&s;e about thee, and &s;hall be as the Stars of Heaven for Multitude, joyning Hands to de&s;troy thee, who&s;e Strength it is impo&s;&s;ible thou &s;hould&s;t re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>But why &s;hall I &s;uppo&s;e thee to be vi|ctorious, even over the few that are ga|thered together to oppo&s;e thee, &s;eeing thou ha&s;t now carry'd on thy Revolt for many Days, and ha&s;t gathered much Peo|ple, and yet ha&s;t not been able to &s;hew thy&s;elf again&s;t them: Surely if thou wer't powerful in thy pre&s;ent Appearance, as thy Friends would have us to believe, thou would&s;t have exerted thy &s;elf now;
<PB N="26" REF="25">
before the Armies of the King were ga|thered together again&s;t thee.</P>
<P>Nor art thou prudent in this thy De|lay; for that thou &s;ee&s;t the Servants of our King are employ'd in di&s;per&s;ing and cru&s;hing thy Friends in the Infancy of their De&s;igns and Plots, and are effectu|ally reducing them to an Incapacity of ap|pearing for thee; whereas had&s;t thou been in a Condition to have prevented it, thou woulde&s;t certainly have endeavoured to re&s;cue them from De&s;truction, or to have turned the hands of the King's Armies from them; wherefore the Weakne&s;s of thy hands is no le&s;s apparent, than the Wickedne&s;s of thy De&s;igns.</P>
<P>What art thou doing, <HI>O Son of Vanity!</HI> and wherefore lifte&s;t thou up thy hand again&s;t thy Ma&s;ter the King? yea where|fore drawe&s;t thou the Sword of Rebellion again&s;t the King, &#38;;eeing thou can&s;t no$ pro&s;per?</P>
<P>I coun&s;el thee likewi&s;e, <HI>Friend John,</HI> to con&s;ider the Circum&s;tances wherein thou &s;tande&s;t, with re&s;pect to the Ju&s;tice and to the Lawfulne&s;s of what thou art now a doing, and whether when thou
<PB N="27" REF="26">
art thus acting, thou art not fighting a|gain&s;t God; for know thou, and be a&s;&s;u|red, that when he thundreth from Hea|ven again&s;t his Enemies, thou &s;halt come into Remembrance before him, and if thou art doing wickedly, thou &s;halt not pro&s;per.</P>
<P>And <HI>Fir&s;t,</HI> I coun&s;el thee to remember that thou ha&s;t lifted up thy hand to the Mo&s;t High, and ha&s;t &s;worn by him, that liveth for ever and ever, that thou would&s;t not do this Thing; but that from thy heart thou would&s;t renounce and for&s;ake the very Per&s;on in who&s;e Name thou ha&s;t now drawn forth thy Sword.</P>
<P>What then, art thou, O Man? What calle&s;t thou thy &s;elf? ha&s;t thou any Sen&s;e of Truth, or believe&s;t thou that there is a God of Truth, who avenges him&s;elf up|on the Violence and Inju&s;tice of wicked Men? It is true, that <HI>Friends</HI> approve not of the manner of Men in that Thing which is called an <HI>Oath,</HI> believing it a prophane and evil Thing, and that we are <HI>to &s;wear not all,</HI> as the <HI>Outward Letter</HI> &s;aith; howbeit, as I am not now to que|&s;tion with thee concerning that Matter, it is yet ju&s;t that I commune with thee after
<PB N="28" REF="27">
thy own Way; <HI>viz.</HI> That fora&s;much as thou art of the Number of tho&s;e who ac|knowledge the Cu&s;tom of affirming or renouncing by an Oath, and that the &s;ame is the mo&s;t &s;olemn Appeal to the All-&s;ee|ing and dreadful God, who&s;e Judgments are thereby &s;olemnly imprecated, and rea|&s;onably to be expected, in ca&s;e of a Breach of the &s;aid Swearing; I &s;ay, for thee to act contrary to tho&s;e Oaths, is the mo&s;t o|pen In&s;ult, which it is po&s;&s;ible for thee to offer to the Omnipotence and Ju&s;tice of Heavenly Maje&s;ty; the bright Beam of who&s;e Spirit &s;hines ineffable in thy Soul, giving thee Light to di&s;cern the Good from the Evil, and thereby taking from thee all Pleas of Ignorance, or other Ex|cu&s;es what&s;oever.</P>
<P>Neither deride thou, like wicked Men, the Light of Divine Knowledge in thy Soul; but remember, if there is no Light within thee, verily there can be none without thee, and thou art given up to eternal Darkne&s;s and Blindne&s;s; but let thy own Tongue confe&s;s thy Guilt in this thing, whereof I now Adverti&s;e thee, <HI>to wit,</HI> that having fir&s;t recognized the Law|fulne&s;s and Solemnity of taking an Oath, this is doubtle&s;s to thee a full An&s;wer, and
<PB N="29" REF="28">
proves that thou art bound thereby in the mo&s;t &s;olemne&s;t manner, both before God, and before Man.</P>
<P>And now, <HI>Friend Mar,</HI> I meekly Ad|verti&s;e and Exhort thee to look back into the Oath of Abjuration which thou ha&s;t taken, revi&s;ing the Terms of it; thou wilt there &s;ee, that in the mo&s;t awful man|ner, thou ha&s;t called thy Creator to wit|ne&s;s, that thou <HI>had&s;t Willingly, Freely, and Truly</HI> Renounced and Abjured the Per|&s;on whom thou now calle&s;t thy King; ha&s;t declared, <HI>That thou do&s;t believe in thy Con&s;cience, that he has not any Right or Title what&s;oever to the Crown of this Realm;</HI> hath Sworn by thy Creator, <HI>That thou wilt, to the utmo&s;t of thy Power, defend</HI> our Lord the King, who now &s;itteth on the Throne, <HI>again&s;t all Trayterous Con&s;piracies what&s;oever which &s;hall be made again&s;t his Per&s;on, Crown, or Dignity,</HI> &amp;c. And which is &s;till more, thou ha&s;t there &s;worn (as thou calle&s;t it,) <HI>To Support, Maintain, and Defend the Succe&s;&s;ion of the Crown again&s;t</HI> the very &s;ame Per&s;on, by Name, JAMES; being the very &s;ame, whom thou ha&s;t now, in a wicked and rebellious manner, recei|ved for thy King, and in Defence of who&s;e
<PB N="30" REF="29">
Preten&s;ions to the Crown thou art now in Rebellion.</P>
<P><HI>Friend Mar,</HI> If thou can'&s;t read over the&s;e Expre&s;&s;ions, and would&s;t con&s;ider, how thou ha&s;t lifted up thy Hand to the Lord in this manner, thou mu&s;t needs be filled with Horror. With what Thoughts can'&s;t thou look into thy inner Man? How mu&s;t Blu&s;hes cover thy Face? How mu&s;t thou &s;tart, and be affrighted at thy own Picture? Verily, Man, thou art gone beyond the ordinary Pitch of e|vil Men; nay, &s;ome have &s;aid, that even Satan him&s;elf, (how great &s;oever the Guilt of his evil Nature is) is out-&s;inn'd in this. Such a Crime hath not been named in <HI>I&s;|rael; What? To fight for the Man whom thou ha&s;t Abjur'd?</HI> Surely, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> thou art hardned more than ever Man was before.</P>
<P>And do'&s;t thou expect Succe&s;s? Pri|thee, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> who do&s;t thou expect it from? From Man, I have told thee, thou can&s;t not expect it, and I cannot per|&s;wade my &s;elf to believe thou ha&s;t the Face to look up towards Heaven for it. Can'&s;t thou ask God to give thee Suc|ce&s;s in breaking an Oath, to ble&s;s Perjury,
<PB N="31" REF="30">
and &s;tand by thee that ha&s;t invoked him &s;olemnly to a Fal&s;ity? I Coun&s;el thee, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> to read again the la&s;t Words of thy Oath, which are the&s;e, <HI>So help me God:</HI> And I would de&s;ire thee to tell me what meaneth that little Word, SO. Be|lieve me, <HI>Friend John,</HI> that Particle &s;oundeth very &s;oft and &s;hort, but it hath a keen and dreadful Signification: SO <HI>help me,</HI> that is SO, may God help thee, and no otherwi&s;e, as thou keepe&s;t the Oath that thou had&s;t taken. Indeed, <HI>Friend John,</HI> this is the Interpretation that all the Doctors and Teachers, among tho&s;e who approve of taking an Oath do put upon this Word. And I mu&s;t tell thee, if this be the meaning, then ha&s;t thou already engaged the Lord of Heaven not to help thee; fora&s;much as thou ha&s;t not kept thy Oath.</P>
<P>I would that thou &s;hould&s;t maturely weigh within thy &s;elf the dreadful Con|dition, into which thou ha&s;t brought thy &s;elf, and tho&s;e that are with thee; for thou art not only fighting again&s;t our Lord the King, but thou art fighting a|gain&s;t the God of the whole Earth, and ha&s;t already lifted up thy Hand in Defi|ance of the Lord, de&s;iring him not to
<PB N="32" REF="31">
ble&s;s thee, or help thee in the Cau&s;e in which thou art engaged.</P>
<P>Now, <HI>Friend Mar,</HI> albeit thou may'&s;t be Re&s;olute enough, or De&s;perate enough, rather to engage in this War, both again&s;t God and the King, yet I would that all thy Helpers were made acquainted here|with, and that thou would&s;t lay the&s;e things fairly before their Eyes; <HI>&s;aying,</HI> I have Renounced the Help of God; there|fore, O Friends, do ye help me, and do ye joyn with me to fight without the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the God of Battle, again&s;t him whom I have &s;worn to Defend, and for him whom I have &s;worn to Oppo&s;e; Yea, O Friends, help me to fight again&s;t the Lord, and again&s;t the King.</P>
<P>Verily, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> If thou &s;hould tell this part of thy Doings in the Ears of thy People, they would fly from thee, as from one who was for&s;aken of God&punc; who&s;e De&s;truction &s;lumbreth not; and, albeit, the People that are with thee, have but little Sen&s;e of the Truth, or of the Fear of the Lord upon their Hearts; yet are there very few &s;o hardned, as to be willing to fight again&s;t God, and joyn with one who hath ca&s;t off Truth, Con|&s;cience,
<PB N="33" REF="32">
Honour, and the God of Hea|ven. Flatter not thy &s;elf, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> with Succe&s;s, while thou art at War with the Almighty, and ha&s;t renounced the Help of him who is alone the &s;trong help|er, whom none can re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>But not to Preach to thee who art har|den'd again&s;t the Spirit of Per&s;wa&s;ion, I &s;hall u&s;e the liberty, <HI>Friend Mar,</HI> to re|late to thee a &s;hort Hi&s;tory of a Ca&s;e &s;ome|thing like thine, tho' not &s;o bad in its Circum&s;tances, and for the Truth of the Story I &s;hall refer thee to the ju&s;t Docu|ments of Antiquity for the Proof of, and as for the Application I &s;hall leave it to thy &s;elf.</P>
<P>About the Year 1472, there was a &s;o|lemn Treaty of Peace made, after long and bloody Wars between <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> the King, Ruling in <HI>Hungary,</HI> and <HI>Amurath</HI> the Ru|ler of the <HI>Turks,</HI> or Wor&s;hippers of the Idol <HI>Mahomet;</HI> which Peace was at its Conclu&s;ion &s;olemnly Ratify'd by the &s;aid King, the Writing being drawn up with the Hand and Seal of the King affixed thereunto, and the &s;aid King took a &s;o|lemn Oath to ob&s;erve the &s;ame.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="33">
It happened that at the Per&s;wa&s;ion of the Pope, and divers of the Princes of the Earth Ruling at that time, that <HI>&V;ladi&s;|laus</HI> the King was prevailed with to make War again upon the &s;aid <HI>Amurath,</HI> with|out any ju&s;t Cau&s;e given, and in Con|tempt of his &s;aid &s;olemn Oath, wherein he had called upon the Lord (as thou ha&s;t now done) to help him SO, as he kept that Oath, and Sworn by his Name, that he would keep the &s;ame.</P>
<P>In the Proce&s;s of this War, a great and bloody Battle was fought by great Num|bers of mighty Men, gathered together on both &s;ides, in the Plains of <HI>Varna.</HI> It hap|pened that by the Valour of the Servants of the &s;aid King, the King of the <HI>Turks</HI> was &s;orely di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and the Battle pre&s;|&s;ed hard upon him, in&s;omuch as that he was nigh to being Vanqui&s;hed; when &s;eeing the Figure of Je&s;us Chri&s;t upon the Cro&s;s, which &s;ome of the Servants of King <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> had profanely di&s;play'd in their Banner, he drew out of his Bo|&s;om the Writing of the Peace, afore&s;aid, with the Hand and Seal of <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> the King affixed thereto, and the Oath of the King written thereon, and &s;tretching
<PB N="35" REF="34">
forth his Hand with the &s;aid Writing to|wards the &s;aid profane Image, and ca&s;ting his Eyes up to Heaven, he Pray'd, &s;ay|ing, <HI>Behold, O thou CR&V;CIFIED GOD, the Faith of the&s;e Chri&s;tians, if they are thy Servants, and thou art a God, do thou a|venge their abominable Perjury.</HI> Whereup|on immediately, it is &s;aid, the Hearts of the Servants of King <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> began to faint, and their Hands became feeble, in&s;omuch that the <HI>Turks,</HI> who was ready to fly, be|came Conquerors. <HI>&V;ladi&s;laus</HI> the Perjur'd King was &s;lain with the Sword, and there fell that Day on his &s;ide thirty thou&s;and mighty Men of Valour, for the Army was utterly overthrown, and very few e&s;caped.</P>
<P>I Coun&s;el thee, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> to apply this Hi&s;tory to thy &s;elf; for be it known to thee, that if the Servants of our Lord the King &s;hould lift up their Hands and Eyes to Heaven in the Day of Battle, and pre&s;enting thy Oath of Abjuration, &s;hould call upon God to Avenge him&s;elf on thy Perjury, and not to help thee who ha&s;t &s;o notoriou&s;ly renounced his A&s;&s;i&s;tance. I doubt not but thy Heart &s;hall &s;ink with|in thee, and thou &s;halt faint in the Battle; for who is the Man, and who art thou, <HI>O vain Creature,</HI> that thy Heart &s;hould
<PB N="36" REF="35">
endure, when thou &s;halt &s;ee the Hand|writing again&s;t thee, and that God whom thou ha&s;t call'd upon, <HI>not to help thee,</HI> &s;et|ting the King's Battle in Array again&s;t thee.</P>
<P>And know, <HI>O Man,</HI> that if it be not thus, but if the Lord does help thee, who ha&s;t thus abjur'd his Help, he mu&s;t do a &s;trange thing in the Earth, and act out of the ordinary Cour&s;e of his heavenly Go|vernment in thy behalf; which I &s;uppo&s;e thou wilt &s;ee &s;mall rea&s;on to expect.</P>
<P>Where then do&s;t thou look for A&s;&s;i|&s;tance, and to whom wilt thou turn thy &s;elf for Help? Man has for&s;aken thee, and God thou ha&s;t for&s;aken; wilt thou fly to the Witchcraft of Satan, and &s;tretch forth thy Hands to the evil Men of the Earth? Shall Thieves and Robbers be thy Refuge, and wilt thou turn De&s;troyer of thy Country? What will it avail thee to do thus? <HI>Had</HI> Zimri <HI>Peace that &s;lew his Ma&s;ter?</HI> Will not the&s;e things end in the De&s;truction of thy &s;elf, and of thy Family; and wilt thou not become the Execration and Hi&s;&s;ing of all that are the Servants of the Lord?</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="36">
But why &s;peak I to thee of the Judg|ments of God? Or why move I thee to look to the Hand of Heaven? Thou who ha&s;t drawn the Sword of Blood, and rai|&s;ed War in the Bowels of the Land; Art not thou hardned above Advice, and pa&s;t the Reproof of Rea&s;on and Sober|ne&s;s? I &s;hall therefore leave Expo&s;tu|lating with thee in that manner, and tell thee in Plainne&s;s and Sincerity, what the Pride of thy Heart, and the ambitious De&s;ires of thy Heart aim at, and how far thou deceive&s;t the People.</P>
<P>Thou thinke&s;t to bring in the Idol of thy Thoughts, whom thou Wor&s;hippe&s;t, and whom thou ha&s;t placed among the Kings; <HI>&s;aying,</HI> That he <HI>&s;hall Reign over us;</HI> and thou ha&s;t &s;mitten with the Sword, divers who have oppo&s;ed thee. Howbe|it, this King, as thou calle&s;t him, is a Stranger, and the People know him not, neither will they obey him.</P>
<P>Likewi&s;e, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> I Adverti&s;e thee, that thy Folly and Arrogance appeareth mo&s;t evident, in that thou flattere&s;t thy &s;elf with Expectations of Succe&s;s, upon thy breaking forth of thy lurking Holes
<PB N="38" REF="37">
and Mountains, into the Lands of the <HI>South,</HI> than which nothing is more prepo|&s;terous in thy Folly; fora&s;much as the Minds of the People in tho&s;e Parts are daily e&s;tranged from thee, and the Power of our Lord the King groweth exceeding Great: So that were it come to pa&s;s, ac|cording as thy Heart de&s;ireth, that thou &s;houlde&s;t be de&s;cended to the Valleys, and to the Plains, thou woulde&s;t be forthwith Overthrown and Di&s;comfited, and all that are with thee will be put to the Edge of the Sword. Wherefore, O Man, pur|&s;ue not thy own De&s;truction, which hangeth already over thy Head; for a&s;&s;u|redly, if thou entere&s;t into Battle with the Servants of the King, thou wilt be de&s;troyed, and the Memory of thee and thy pretended King will be wiped out from off the Face of the Earth.</P>
<P>Finally, <HI>Lord Mar,</HI> I &s;ignify unto thee, that having &s;aid the&s;e things to thee in time, that thou may&s;t repent, and re|turn to thy Obedience to the King; if thou continue ob&s;tinate, I &s;hall &s;peak to thee again more particularly, as it &s;hall be revealed to me of what &s;hall befal thee, and the People that are with thee.
