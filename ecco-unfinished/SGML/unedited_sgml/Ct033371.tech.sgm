<HEAD>HEREDITARY &amp; INDEFEASIBLE RIGHT
OF
KINGS.</HEAD>
<P>THE hereditary-inde&s;ea&s;ible right of kings,
and pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;t|ance
its genuine offspring, are doctrines which
of late have made a great noi&s;e in Europe, and
particularly in this i&s;land.</P>
<P>WHEN we con&s;ider man, ab&s;tracted from
all po&s;itive engagements, we find nothing in
his nature, or in his &s;ituation, to &s;ubject him
to the power of any, his creator and his pa|rents
excepted. The parental power is at an
end when children are grown up, and can
provide for them&s;elves. At any rate the pa|rental
power cannot &s;ub&s;i&s;t longer than the
life of the parents; for it is not a matter of
property to be tran&s;mitted by &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. &s;ince
it depends upon per&s;onal circum&s;tances. And
&s;uppo&s;ing it a &s;ubject to be taken by &s;ucce&s;|&s;ion,
it mu&s;t de&s;cend to all the children equal|ly,
at lea&s;t to all the &s;ons equally; for prime|geniture,
<PB N="4" REF="3">
'tis certain, is not a right of the law
of nature, but a con&s;equence only of the feu|dal
law. Hence it is a principle embraced by
the grave&s;t writers, that all mankind are born
free, and independent of one another.</P>
<P>MAN indeed is fitted for &s;ociety. His wants
prompt him to it, and his inclinations render
it agreeable. Accordingly we find mankind
almo&s;t every where parcelled out into &s;ocieties,
which have been originally formed by acci|dental
circum&s;tances, more or le&s;s exten&s;ive.
A &s;ociety of any extent cannot be without
government. The members mu&s;t have laws
to determine their differences, and they mu&s;t
have rulers to put their laws in execution. At
the &s;ame time, we find the con&s;titutions of
different &s;tates, with regard to government,
almo&s;t as various as are the &s;entiments of men
concerning it: So that tho' government be
nece&s;&s;ary to the well-being of &s;ociety, yet from
this circum&s;tance alone, were we to look no
further back, we may conclude no particular
form to be nece&s;&s;ary, but the effect of choice,
or perhaps in $word$ mea&s;ure of accident.</P>
<P>LET us trace this matter further, becau&s;e it
is of importance. Man is a &s;hy animal, and in
<PB N="5" REF="4">
his original &s;tate rather aver&s;e to &s;ociety. In
that &s;tate his wants were few, and ea&s;ily &s;up|plied;
therefore we may readily conclude,
that while acorns were the food of man, and
water his drink, there was neither u&s;e nor ap|petite
for &s;ociety. Accordingly we find man|kind
originally in every corner of the earth
living in &s;cattered habitations, with little in|tercour&s;e,
except among members of the &s;ame
family. The culture of corn laid the founda|tion
of a more exten&s;ive intercour&s;e, becau&s;e
thereby mutual a&s;&s;i&s;tance became nece&s;&s;ary.
When arts were invented, and indu&s;try increa&s;|ed,
it was found convenient to herd together
in towns and villages. From this clo&s;&s;er con|nection
one evil &s;prung, oppo&s;ition of intere&s;ts,
formerly rare; which at fir&s;t was the occa&s;ion
of quarrels and blood&s;hed, and afterwards of
frequent appeals to men of weight and pro|bity.
In time the nece&s;&s;ity of fixed judges
to determine differences being di&s;covered, the
election of the&s;e judges, which could not o|therways
be than popular, was the fir&s;t &s;tep to
government. The chief magi&s;trate therefore
was originally no more but the chief judge,
who&s;e powers were gradually extended, as
ca&s;es occured which required the interpo&s;ition
of a &s;uperior governor. War introduced Sla|very,
<PB N="6" REF="5">
as it &s;ubjected tho&s;e taken in battle to
the arbitrary will of their conquerors; and ab|&s;olute
power was too de&s;irable an acqui&s;ition
to be the perqui&s;ite of &s;ubjects only. The
chief magi&s;trate, however repugnant it is to
the nature of his office, did often gra&s;p at it:
And hi&s;tory informs us, that the chief magi|&s;trate,
in different &s;ocieties, has been often but
too &s;ucce&s;sful. In a word, ab&s;olute indepen|dence
and ab&s;olute power are the two ex|tremes;
and the latter, at lea&s;t &s;o far as con|cerns
&s;overeignty, could never have been in|troduced,
but by pa&s;&s;ing through all the inter|mediate
degrees.</P>
<P>GOVERNMENT therefore is one of the arts
which nece&s;&s;ity has &s;ugge&s;ted, which time and
experience have ripened, and which mu&s;t be
perpetually &s;ubject to further improvements.
For government, like all other arts, being in|vented
for the good of mankind, it mu&s;t be the
privilege of every &s;ociety to improve upon it,
as well as upon manufactures or hu&s;bandry.
No particular form therefore can be nece&s;&s;ary,
as no particular form is preferable to another,
unle&s;s &s;o far as it has a greater tendency to
promote its end, the good of the &s;ociety. Com|paring
democracy, ari&s;tocracy, and monarchy
together, this is their common &s;tandard.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="6">
THERE is a people inhabiting the earth who
are not left to the choice of their governors,
but are by nature &s;ubjected to monarchy. In
every &s;ociety there is a royal family, of a dif|ferent
&s;pecies from the other members. Every
monarch is born with marks of royalty, of a
peculiar &s;hape, and with &s;uperior beauty. We
may &s;uppo&s;e that the excellencies of the
mind are not inferior to tho&s;e of the body; and
no wonder when this is the ca&s;e, that perfect
obedience is given through all the &s;tate, and
that their monarch's will is their only law.&mdash;
There the parts are ju&s;tly di&s;tributed, the &s;o|vereign
framed for command, as the &s;ubjects
for obedience, each in their &s;everal capacities
equally contributing to the only end of go|vernment,
the well-being of the &s;ociety. Here
there can be no &s;tretching of prerogative on
the one hand, no re&s;i&s;tance nor even murmurs
on the other. The monarch, taught by nature
that the &s;overeign power is a tru&s;t which ought
not to be abu&s;ed, has no de&s;ire but to promote
the public welfare. The people, taught by
nature that pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;t|ance
are the only means to promote their hap|pine&s;s,
implicitly &s;ubmit them&s;elves to their
monarch's will.</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="7">
WERE mankind &s;o framed, for of in&s;ects we
have been &s;peaking, the&s;e gentlemen would
have rea&s;on on their &s;ide who declare &s;o &s;trong|ly
for indefea&s;ible-hereditary right, and the
reciprocal duty of pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non|re&s;i&s;tance:
Were our royal family, like that
of the bees, di&s;tingui&s;hed from the ma&s;s of the
people by &s;uperior excellencies, whether of the
mind or body, were they unerringly prompt|ed
by nature to exerci&s;e their power for the
welfare of the &s;ociety, blind obedience to their
will would be a virtue. But when we tru&s;t
with &s;overeign power one of the common
&s;tamp of mankind, who has by nature no
marks of royalty, and who perhaps by nature
is not fitted for command, the ab&s;urdity is
great to maintain that this per&s;on ought to
be under no controul, and that we ought to
continue to tru&s;t him, after repeated in&s;tances
of his betraying the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him.</P>
<P>I HAVE no occa&s;ion to con&s;ider whether con|que&s;t
be a good title by the law of nature to
acquire the ab&s;olute dominion of a &s;tate, as in
Turky, where the Grand Signior is &s;uppo&s;ed
to be the lord of the manor, and all the peo|ple
his &s;laves. This is not government, the
characteri&s;tic of which is tru&s;t repo&s;ed in one
<PB N="9" REF="8">
for the good of the whole. It is like a private
e&s;tate, which may be di&s;po&s;ed of by the pro|prietor
without controul, and applied for his
own purpo&s;es. It cannot be pretended that
the king of Britain has his right by conque&s;t,
and therefore no &s;upport can be drawn to the
argument from that quarter.</P>
<P>THE &s;cheme, it mu&s;t be yielded, is &s;o far
con&s;i&s;tent, that if we &s;uppo&s;e the king's right
to be indefea&s;ible, and that he cannot be de|prived
of his authority however much his
mea&s;ures &s;werve from the rules of good go|vernment,
it mu&s;t follow, that the people are
tied to pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance,
as there is no medium betwixt re&s;i&s;tance and
obedience. But where is the foundation of
the indefea&s;ible right of the king, more than
of any other officer of the &s;tate? Does it lie
in the name? One &s;hould &s;carce think &s;o,
when the name is indifferently applied to go|vernors
who have very little power, as well
as to tho&s;e who&s;e power is the mo&s;t exten&s;ive.</P>
<P>It cannot lie in the nature of the office,
which being a tru&s;t, is undoubtedly forfeitable
upon mal-admini&s;tration. It will perhaps be
&s;aid to lie in the con&s;titution of our govern|ment
<PB N="10" REF="9">
So far from it, that no man is bound
to obey the king's commands, unle&s;s delivered
in a certain form pre&s;cribed by law. And
even in France, &s;uppo&s;ing it an ab&s;olute mo|narchy,
without any con&s;titutional check upon
the king's actions, the king's power is notwith|&s;tanding
limited. There cannot be &s;uch a
thing in nature as for a people voluntarily to
&s;urrender their liberties to the arbitrary will
of any man. The act would be void as incon|&s;i&s;tent
with the great law of nature, <HI>&s;alus po|puli
&s;uprema lex.</HI></P>
<P>But the favourers of this doctrine when beat
out of the&s;e entrenchments, have a retreat
which they &s;uppo&s;e impregnable. They allow
at la&s;t that the king may do wrong, by betray|ing
the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him. But then they
maintain, that a king having no &s;uperior on
earth can have no proper judge of his actions
but God alone, from whom his power &s;lows,
and therefore is accountable to the Almighty
only. This is a fortre&s;s built upon &s;and. All
power no doubt is from God, natural and legal,
for he is the creator and upholder of all things.
But it follows from this, in&s;tead of being con|tradictory
to it, that every &s;ort of power is li|mited
by the oppo&s;ition of other powers, na|tural
<PB N="11" REF="10">
or legal, which are equally from God
with the power re&s;i&s;ted. Perhaps they mean
that every king has his commi&s;&s;ion from the
Almighty, and not from the people. Hi&s;to|ry
alone may &s;uffice to inform us, that this
cannot be, when there have exi&s;ted &s;o many
kings unworthy of command. But &s;uppo&s;ing
the fact, it does not follow that this commi&s;&s;ion
is unlimited. On the contrary it mu&s;t be li|mited;
for who can patronize &s;o impious a
doctrine as that God &s;hould give a direct com|mi&s;&s;ion
to any being to plague and per&s;ecute
mankind, unle&s;s for their &s;ins? The voice of
nature is the voice of God; and it is a fixed
principle in the law of nature, that where
there is no common judge to appeal to, the
party injured may do him&s;elf ju&s;tice. The
laws are &s;uperior to the king, and the&s;e he mu&s;t
be judged by. And &s;uppo&s;ing an ab&s;olute
government in the &s;tricte&s;t &s;en&s;e, where the
king's will is law, yet there is one law above
him. If his actions generally tend to de&s;truc|tion
in&s;tead of government, the people, who
have no judge to appeal to, may lawfully do
them&s;elves right. <HI>Salus populi e&s;t &s;uprema lex.</HI></P>
<P>But after all, where is the nece&s;&s;ity of God's
extraordinary interpo&s;ition by granting his im|mediate
<PB N="12" REF="11">
commi&s;&s;ion to kings, when in other mat|ters
$words$ to $overn the world by &s;econd
$word$ and ordinary means? Why &s;hould we
&s;uppo&s;e, that mankind are deprived of their na|tural
privilege of chu&s;ing their fir&s;t magi&s;trate,
more than of chu&s;ing tho&s;e that are &s;ubordi|nate?
Where is this commi&s;&s;ion recorded? Is
it given to all rulers who have the name of king,
or are &s;ome nations peculiarily honoured? Is
it given to all &s;overeigns in general, whether
honoured with the name of king or not? Had
all the crown-va&s;&s;als in France, dukes, earls,
barons, this commi&s;&s;ion, who u&s;urped, and,
for many ages, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a &s;ort of &s;overeignty
within their own territories? The&s;e are puz|zling
que&s;tions, and it would require a mo&s;t
expre&s;s revelation to put an end to the doubts
that ari&s;e from them. The legi&s;lative power,
one &s;hould imagine, is of a &s;uperior rank to
that of the king, becau&s;e that power gives laws
to the king; yet no peculiar interpo&s;ition
of providence is pretended in its behalf. This
body is left to be modelled bychoice or by ac|cident.
The government of the world is after
this manner carried on; and yet nothing hap|pens,
we may pre&s;ume, contradictory to the
original plan of providence. Why then a pe|culiar
providence in behalf of kings, or an im|mediate
<PB N="13" REF="12">
revelation, when there appears to be
no nece&s;&s;ity? We cannot, withour impiety, ad|mit
of the &s;uppo&s;ition, when, &s;o far as weak
man can conjecture about the operations of
the Almighty, he never interpo&s;es by extraor|dinary
means, unle&s;s where the ordinary di&s;|pen&s;ations
of providence prove in&s;ufficient to
an&s;wer his purpo&s;es: We may therefore con|clude,
with the highe&s;t degree of a&s;&s;urance, that
kings have no other commi&s;&s;ion from God but
what every magi&s;trate has, &s;upreme and &s;ub|ordinate,
who is legally elected according to
the &s;tanding laws of the &s;ociety to which he
belongs.</P>
<P>BUT doubts and difficulties multiply upon
us. Were all the nations pointed out by an
expre&s;s revelation who, like the Jews of old,
are to be governed by magi&s;trates of God's ex|pre&s;s
appointment; were all the families point|ed,
out who are to bear his commi&s;&s;ion, the re|velation
would &s;till be imperfect. It is not
enough to point out the family; the rules of
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion mu&s;t al&s;o be a&s;certained, that there
be no di&s;pure about the particular per&s;ons who
are to enjoy this hereditary-indefea&s;ible right.
Here, without a new revelation, we are left
<PB N="14" REF="13">
in a great mea&s;ure at an uncertainty; for, are
we to follow the rules of England or France?
Are we to be guided by the law as at pre&s;ent
e&s;tabli&s;hed, or as it was three centuries ago?
Whatever rules are followed, we mu&s;t &s;ee that
they are in a great mea&s;ure arbitrary, the off|&s;pring
of accident, or of the &s;lendere&s;t feelings
of the imagination, and e&s;tabli&s;hed by cu&s;tom
only. Has not this a &s;trong appearance of
leaving to every nation the choice of their own
chief magi&s;trates? Kings were at fir&s;t general|ly
cho&s;en for life. It crept into practice to
make all public offices hereditary; and &s;o
the &s;overeign power has generally come to be
hereditary, partly from the bent of the people,
and partly to avoid the inconveniencies which
elective monarchy is &s;ubjected to. But after
what manner is this hereditary right of kings
carried on? Not by any univer&s;al law, expre&s;s|ly
revealed or wrought into the nature of man;
&s;o far from it, that the rules of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion are
different in every different country, e&s;tabli&s;hed
by cu&s;tom alone, or, in other words, by the con|&s;ent
of the people. In France, for example,
the females are totally excluded. Have fe|males
by the appointment of the Almighty this
indefea&s;ible right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion? If they have,
<PB N="15" REF="14">
France for many ages has been in a damn|able
error. If not, the load of the guilt mu&s;t
lie upon England, and upon many other coun|tries
who admit of female &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. In my
apprehen&s;ion, this con&s;equence cannot be
evaded, otherways than by fairly acknowledg|ing
that God, in this matter, as well as in
others, works by &s;econd cau&s;es without any
direct interpo&s;ition, leaving every nation to be
governed by laws of their own appointment.
And indeed nothing looks liker a contradiction
than to &s;uppo&s;e that hereditary monarchy is
the appointment of the Almighty, and that he
has be&s;towed upon every heir an indefea&s;ible
right, not to be di&s;pen&s;ed with upon any oc|ca&s;ion
whatever, without pointing out, by in|fallible
marks, the per&s;ons who are to enjoy
this extraordinary privilege; commanding us,
under the pain of damnation, to give entire
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to per&s;ons, as rulers appointed by
him, without revealing who the&s;e per&s;ons are.</P>
<P>ANOTHER inference may be drawn from this
doubtfulne&s;s of the law of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. It is a
&s;elf-evident propo&s;ition, that no right can be
&s;tronger than the title upon which it is found|ed.
No title is more &s;lender, in mo&s;t in&s;tances,
<PB N="16" REF="15">
than that of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. How then can it be
maintained, that the hereditary right of kings
is indefea&s;ible, when the title upon which the
right is founded is &s;o weak and &s;o arbitrary.
I think we may with certainty conclude, that
&s;uch a right mu&s;t, upon every occa&s;ion, give
place to the primary rights of nature, &s;uch as
tend to our pre&s;ervation and well-being; and
therefore that any particular heir may be &s;afe|ly
&s;et a&s;ide, when he becomes dangerous to
the &s;ociety. For this is a&s;&s;uredly the voice of
God, that in every conflict the weaker right
mu&s;t yield to the &s;tronger. Nay we may go
one &s;tep further, that if the good of the &s;ociety
can be more promoted by a different form of
government, hereditary right may be laid a&s;ide
altogether without any crime; &s;ince the good
of the &s;ociety is an object of much greater im|portance
than the right of any particular family
can be.</P>
<P>TOUCHING the family of Stuart, no right
has a le&s;s air of divine authority than what they
had to the crown of Britain. To look no further
back than to the competition betwixt Bruce
and Baliol, which in the&s;e days appeared and
truly was an intricate affair: was Baliol a king
<PB N="17" REF="16">
by divine appointment, when he was acknow|ledged
and &s;ubmitted to, in con&s;equence of an
award given by Edward of England, who
plainly manife&s;ted, by the whole cour&s;e of his
proceedings, that he was more &s;wayed by po|litical
con&s;iderations than by ju&s;tice and equi|ty?
Unhappy is the condition of that people
who, under the pain of damnation, mu&s;t yield
pa&s;&s;ive obedience and non-re&s;i&s;tance to a mo|narch,
and yet have no better authority to di|rect
their duty than &s;uch an award. It will
be &s;aid, that the merits of the cau&s;e were with
Baliol. But how the patrons of the divine
right of kings &s;hould come to a certainty in
this matter, I'm at a lo&s;s to under&s;tand. For
not to mention the preten&s;ions of his competi|tor
Bruce, it is perhaps not extremly clear that
a female has any divine right to a crown; at
lea&s;t, there is no in&s;tance of this among&s;t the
Jews. And if females are admitted, I can|not
&s;ee why the kingdom ought not to be &s;plit
among&s;t female heirs, as well as a private e&s;tate.
If right to a crown be con&s;idered as a matter
of property, there certainly ought to be no differ|ence.
But laying a&s;ide all difficulties, and &s;uppo|&s;ing
Baliol's right of primogeniture to be invin|cibly
good, 'tis plain Robert Bruce could have
<PB N="18" REF="17">
no divine right, nor can the Stuarts have a
divine right who derive their right from him.
It is but a mean &s;ubterfuge, that none of Ba|liol's
race appear to claim the crown. Will
it be &s;aid, that this nation continued in an ob|&s;tinate
cour&s;e of rebellion again&s;t the king of
heaven, &s;o long as any of Baliol's race exi&s;ted?
How do we know they do not at pre&s;ent exi&s;t?
It is our indi&s;pen&s;ible duty to &s;earch for the
king whom God has given us thro' every corner
of the earth. And 'tis equally our duty to re|fu&s;e
our obedience to an u&s;urper; and he mu&s;t be
&s;o, who has not a hereditary right, and con&s;e|quently
is not of God's appointment. Let
us keep in view, that pre&s;cription, po&s;itive or
negative, can avail nothing, which has no other
foundation but univer&s;al con&s;ent, implied from
a long acquie&s;cence.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;erters of this divine right dare not yield
that Baliol forfeited the crown of Scotland, by
acknowledging him&s;elf to be the king of Eng|land's
va&s;&s;al; for this would be ju&s;tifying the late
revolution in every point. Making an indepen|dent
kingdom a fief of another &s;overeignty, is
not more &s;ubver&s;ive of the con&s;titution, than
the mea&s;ures are which were pur&s;ued by James
<PB N="19" REF="18">
VII. during the whole cour&s;e of his reign. And
if the people of Scotland could lawfully judge
that Baliol had &s;ubverted the con&s;titution, and
upon that judgment transfer the crown to
another, the people of Britain had the &s;ame
title to give judgment again&s;t James VII.
and to declare that he had forfeited the crown.</P>
<P>WITH regard to England, the pretext of a di|vine
right is &s;till more lame, if po&s;&s;ible. William
the conqueror was a ba&s;tard, and could have
no divine right to the dukedom of Normandy;
nor did he him&s;elf pretend any other right to
the crown of England, than by the te&s;tament
of Edward the confe&s;&s;or. But &s;uppo&s;ing him
to have conquered England, which will not be
readily yielded, he certainly did not conquer
his Norman &s;ubjects who came over with him
to England, and from whom, for ought we
know, a great part of the nation are de&s;cended.
The Stuarts therefore who have no other
claim to the crown of England, but by a fe|male
connection with the race of William the
conqueror, cannot, with any &s;hadow of rea&s;on,
in&s;i&s;t upon their beloved doctrine of a divine
right, &s;o far as concerns the Engli&s;h, who are
of Norman extraction.</P>
<P><PB N="20" REF="19">
ON the whole, &s;uppo&s;ing the hereditary right
of kings to be the appointment of God, inde|fea&s;ible
and indi&s;pen&s;ible, the following points
ought to be a&s;cerained: 1. Whether this law
be univer&s;al, to take place over the whole earth,
or if it be limited to certain nations, and what
the&s;e nations are. 2. To what particular families
does this divine right belong, who are thus
made &s;uperior to the re&s;t of mankind. 3. The
rules of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which concern the&s;e parti|cular
families, ought to be di&s;tinct and per&s;pi|cuous,
&s;o as to procure a perfect agreement a|mong&s;t
mankind, as about the primary laws of
nature. 4. The&s;e rules ought to be wrought
into our nature, and the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of them
attended with the &s;tronge&s;t &s;en&s;e of immorality,
like treachery or murder. Were the&s;e points
thoroughly cleared, the &s;cheme might be con|&s;i&s;tent;
but as it &s;tands, it is attended with
doubts and darkne&s;s, to lead every hone&s;t heart
who e&s;pou&s;es it into endle&s;s perplexities.</P>
<P>MODERN hi&s;tories are full of the evils occa&s;ion|ed
by di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ions; they are &s;till fuller
of the evils occa&s;ioned by conte&s;ts about the
king's prerogative. There can be no mode|ration
in &s;uch controver&s;ies, where God Almigh|ty
<PB N="21" REF="20">
is made a party, and every per&s;on called
impious who takes the oppo&s;ite &s;ide. Hereby
it comes, that this doctrine of the hereditary
indefea&s;ible right of kings &s;eldom fails to break
the peace of &s;ociety, to fo&s;ter inveterate enmities,
and to be the &s;ource of endle&s;s wars; of which,
were there no other evidence, the pre&s;ent times
afford a deplorable in&s;tance. So that, if we
are to give any parent to this doctrine other
than blind enthu&s;ia&s;m, we can never a&s;cribe it
to a good being. And indeed if there is an
invi&s;ible power a greater enemy to mankind
than another, he could not po&s;&s;ibly in&s;til into
us a more poi&s;onous principle. Plague and
famine are nothing to it.</P>
<P>BUT, tho' I have been de&s;ervedly &s;evere upon
the doctrine, I would not be under&s;tood to
pa&s;s the &s;ame cen&s;ure upon its votaries. I am
&s;en&s;ible the further removed a tenet is from
truth, the difficulty of conver&s;ion is propor|tionally
great. 'Tis like love be&s;towed upon
an ugly woman, which is ob&s;erved to be ever
without bounds. The Jacobites, &s;uch as are
not of a de&s;perate fortune, certainly de&s;erve
compa&s;&s;ion, even while they are laying wa&s;te
their country by inte&s;tine commotions. They
<PB N="22" REF="21">
can have no other motive but principle, when
they venture their lives and their fortunes
in the &s;ervice of their idol prince, as their
pro&s;pect of &s;ucce&s;s can never balance the ha|zard.
What pity is it they were not employ|ed
in a better cau&s;e. But if nothing el&s;e will
open their eyes, ought it not to have &s;ome
weight, that there is nothing more repugnant
to the laws which mu&s;t govern all &s;ocieties,
than for any &s;ingle man, or &s;et of men, to force
their opinion upon the majority. How would
they reli&s;h the behaviour of a member of their
own parliament, who &s;hould endeavour by
force of arms to oblige the whole body to &s;ub|mit
to his &s;entiment? Or how would they re|li&s;h
it, that a body of men &s;hould ri&s;e in arms
upon no better pretext than the procuring
ju&s;tice to a friend whom they &s;uppo&s;e to be
unju&s;tly condemned by the whole body of judg|es?
Is it not an excu&s;e commonly given by
banditti for robbing on the highway, that they
are but making repri&s;als upon account of
goods unju&s;tly wre&s;ted from them by authority
of law? Yet this is preci&s;ely the pre&s;ent ca&s;e.
King James was &s;et a&s;ide by the authority of the
nation, <HI>i. e.</HI> by the act of the majority, who from
<PB N="23" REF="22">
the very nature of &s;ociety, mu&s;t be the ultimate
judges, in all matters which concern their pre|&s;ervation
and well-being. Perhaps he was un|ju&s;tly
condemned. Be it &s;o for argument's &s;ake.
But an ultimate judgment mu&s;t lie &s;omewhere,
without further appeal. It mu&s;t be a funda|mental
law in all &s;ocieties to aquie&s;ce in this
ultimate judgment, right or wrong, without
which concord cannot be pre&s;erved but for a
moment. No hone&s;t remedy after this can
remain, but to de&s;ert the &s;ociety and to join
&s;ome other, where the rules of ju&s;tice are &s;up|po&s;ed
to be better ob&s;erved. Can it be thought
that the right of any man in a &s;ociety, &s;uppo&s;|ing
him to be a chief magi&s;trate, tru&s;ted with
the greate&s;t powers, is &s;uperior to the funda|mental
laws of the &s;ociety whence he derives
this right? It is an ab&s;urdity, the &s;ame as that
a part is greater than the whole. It were to
be wi&s;hed, that gentlemen would &s;eriou&s;ly con|&s;ider
this matter, who are &s;o &s;trenuous for the
claim of an abdicated king, and who would
embroil heaven and earth to compa&s;s the re|&s;toration
of the family. And would they but
allow them&s;elves to think with any degree of
coolne&s;s, they would &s;oon be convinced, that
<PB N="24" REF="23">
the peace of &s;ociety is an object of greater im|portance
than the right of any particular man
can be, &s;uppo&s;ing him to be de&s;cended from a
thou&s;and kings.</P>
