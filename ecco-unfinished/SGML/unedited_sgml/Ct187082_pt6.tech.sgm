<P>THE &s;erenity of virtue would now again have made
its abode the brea&s;t of Mr. Tyrold, but for the con|&s;tant
wretchedne&s;s to which he &s;aw his daughter a
prey. With the benigne&s;t pity he &s;trove to revive
her; a pity unabated by-any wonder, unalloyed with
any blame. His wonder fell all upon Edg$$, whom
he con&s;idered as refining away mortal happine&s;s, by
di&s;&s;atisfaction that it was not divine; but his cen&s;ure;
which he re&s;erved wholly for vice, ex$nerated them
both. Still however, he flattered him&s;elf that ere
long, to-her youthful mind and native chearfulne&s;s,
tranquillity, if not felicity, would imperceptibly re|turn,
from &s;uch a union for exertion of filial and &s;i&s;|terly
duties: that indu&s;try would &s;weeten re&s;t, virtue
gild privation, and &s;elf-approvance convert every &s;a|crifice
into enjoyment.</P>
<P>But peace &s;uch as this was far from her bo&s;om.
While the de&s;ertion of Edgar had tolled the death
bell to all her hopes, an unremitting contention di&s;|turbed
her mind, whether to avow or conceal her &s;itu|ation
with regard to the money-lender. The r$flecti|ons
of every night brought a di&s;&s;atisfaction in her con|duct,
which determined her upon an openne&s;s the mo&s;t
undi&s;gui&s;ed for the following morning: but timidity,
and the de&s;ire of reprieve from the fearful ta&s;k, again,
the following morning, regularly po&s;tponed her pur|po&s;e.</P>
<P>In the $word$ horror occa&s;ioned by her father's di&s;tre&s;s
from the bills of her brother, &s;he wrote a &s;upp$icating
letter to Mrs. Mittin, to $word$ &s;he would endeavour
to quiet her creditors till &s;he could arrange &s;omething
for their payment. And while this produced a cor|re&s;pondence
replete with danger, difficulty, and im|propriety,
a new circum&s;tance occurred, which yet
more cruelly embittered her conflicting emotions.
<PB N="176" REF="3">
Lavinia, in the virtuous eagerne&s;s of her heart to
forward the general oeconomy, in&s;i&s;ted wholly to re|linqui&s;h,
for this year, her appropriate allowance;
declaring that, by careful management, &s;he could di&s;|pen&s;e
with any thing new, and that the very few ex|pences
&s;he might find utterly unavoidable, &s;he would
demand from time to time as they occurred. Camilla,
at this propo&s;ition, retreated, in agony, to her chamber.
To make the &s;ame was impo&s;&s;ible; for how, then,
find intere&s;t for the money-lender? yet to with&s;tand
&s;o ju&s;t an example, &s;eemed a di&s;grace to every duty
and every feeling.</P>
<P>Lavinia, who, in her countenance and abrupt de|parture,
read the new di&s;tre&s;s &s;he had incautiou&s;ly ex|cited,
with a thou&s;and &s;elf-reproaches followed her.
She had con&s;idered but the common cau&s;e when &s;he
&s;poke, without weighing the &s;trange appearance of not
being &s;econded by her &s;i&s;ter: But her mind was
among&s;t the la&s;t to covet the narrow prai&s;e of in&s;idi|ous
compari&s;on; and her concern for the propo&s;al &s;he
had made, when &s;he &s;aw its effect, was as deep as
that of Camilla in hearing it, though not attended
with the &s;ame aggravations.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold remained utterly &s;urpri&s;ed. The gene|rous
and di&s;intere&s;ted nature of Camilla, made it im|po&s;&s;ible
to &s;u&s;pect her re&s;trained by a greater love of
money than Lavinia; and he could not endure to &s;up|po&s;e
her late vi&s;its to public places, had rendered per|&s;onal
oeconomy more painful. But he would make no
enquiry that might &s;eem a reproach; nor &s;uffer any
privation or contribution that was not chearful and
voluntary.</P>
<P>The purcha&s;es for the wedding of Mi&s;s Dennel
being now made, that young lady came down to the coun|try
to &s;olemnize her nuptials, accompanied by Mrs.
Mittin, who in&s;tantly vi&s;ited Camilla. She could
&s;ettle nothing, &s;he &s;aid, with the money-lender, with|out
the premium; but &s;he had coaxed all the creditors,
by a&s;&s;uring them, that, as the debtor was a great
<PB N="177" REF="4">
heire&s;s, they were certain of their money when &s;he
came to her e&s;tate. Camilla could not endure to owe
their forbearance to a fal&s;hood; though to convince
Mrs. Mittin of her errour, in contradiction to the a&s;&s;ertion
of Lionel, was a vain attempt. The bu&s;ine&s;s, how|ever,
pre&s;&s;ed; and to keep back the&s;e but too ju&s;t
claimants was her pre&s;ent mo&s;t fervent de&s;ire. Mrs.
Mittin was among&s;t the mo&s;t expert of expedient|mongers,
and &s;oon &s;tarted a method for rai&s;ing the
premium. She a&s;ked to look at what Camilla po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
of trinkets: and the prize ear-rings of Tun|bridge,
the ear-rings and necklace of Southampton,
and &s;everal &s;mall toys occa&s;ionally given her, were
collected. The locket &s;he al&s;o demanded, to make
weight; but neither that, nor the peculiar gifts, a$
keep-&s;akes, of her father, mother, or uncle, con&s;i&s;t|ing
of a &s;eal, a ring, and a watch, would &s;he part
with. What &s;he would relinqui&s;h, however, Mrs.
Mittin di&s;po&s;ed of to one of her numerous friends&punc;
but they rai&s;ed only, when intrin&s;ically valued, &s;ix|teen
pounds. Lavinia then in&s;i&s;ted upon coming for|ward
with a contribution of every trinket &s;he was
worth, &s;ave what had the &s;ame &s;acred motives of
detention: and the twenty pounds, without any cere|mony
of acknowledgment, were delivered to Mr.
Clykes; who then took into his own hands the pay|ment
of the hundred and eighteen pounds; for which
he received a bond, &s;igned by Camilla, and witne&s;&s;ed
by Mrs. Mittin; and another note of hand, promi&s;ing
ten per cent. intere&s;t for the &s;um, till the principal
were repaid. The&s;e two notes, he acknowledged,
were mere pledges of honour, as the law would treat
her as an infant; but he never acted without them, as
they prevented mi&s;takes in private dealings.</P>
<P>This important affair arranged, Camilla felt &s;ome|what
more at ea&s;e; &s;he was relieved from hourly
alarms, and left the mi&s;tre&s;s to make her confe&s;&s;ion as
circum&s;tances directed. But &s;he obtained not for no|thing
the agency of Mrs. Mittin, who was not a cha|racter
to leave &s;elf out of con&s;ideration in her tran&s;|actions
for others; and at every vi&s;it made at Ether|ington
<PB N="178" REF="5">
from this time, &s;he ob&s;erved &s;ome thing in
the apparel of Camilla that was utterly old fa&s;hion|ed,
or too mean for her to wear; but which would
do well enough for her&s;elf, when vamped up, as &s;he
knew how. Her obligations and inexperience
made it impo&s;&s;ible to her to re&s;i&s;t, though, at this
&s;ea&s;on of &s;aving care, &s;he gave up nothing which
&s;he could not have rendered u&s;eful by indu&s;try and
contrivance.</P>
<P>During this unhappy period at Etherington, a
brighter, though not unclouded &s;cene, was exhi|bited
at Cleves. Melmond arrived; he was per|mitted
to pay his addre&s;&s;es to the fair Indiana, and
believed felicity cele&s;tial accorded to him even
upon earth.</P>
<P>But this adored object her&s;elf &s;uffered &s;ome &s;e|vere
repining at her fate, when &s;he &s;aw, from her
window, her lover gallop into the park without
equipage, without dome&s;tics, and mounted on a
hired hor&s;e. The grimacing &s;hrugs of Mi&s;s Marg|land
&s;hewed &s;he entered into this mortification;
and they were nearly con&s;piring to di&s;mi&s;s the ig|noble
pretender, when a letter, which he mode&s;t|ly
&s;ent up, from his &s;i&s;ter, inviting Indiana to pa&s;s
a few weeks in Gro&s;venor Square, once again &s;e|cured
the intere&s;t of the brother. She &s;uffered,
therefore, Sir Hugh to hand her down &s;tairs, and
the enamoured Melmond thought him&s;elf the mo&s;t
ble&s;t of men.</P>
<P>The &s;ight of &s;uch eager enjoyment, and the
really amiable qualities of this youth, &s;oon com|pletely
reconciled the Baronet to this new bu&s;ine&s;s;
for he &s;aw no rea&s;on, he &s;aid, in fact, why one
niece had not as good a right to be married fir&s;t as
another. The generous and &s;entimental Eugenia
never cea&s;ed her kind offices, and &s;teadily wore an
air of tolerable chearfulne&s;s all day, though her
pillow was nightly wetted with tears for her un|fortunate
lot.</P>
<P><PB N="179" REF="6">
Nor, with all her native equanimity and acquir|ed
philo&s;ophy, was this a &s;ituation to bring back
&s;ere$ity. The enthu&s;ia&s;tic raptures of Melmond
elevated him, in her eyes, to &s;omething above hu|man;
and while his adoration of Indiana pre&s;ented
to her a picture of all &s;he thought mo&s;t fa&s;cinating,
his grateful &s;oftne&s;s of re&s;pect to her&s;elf was pene|tratingly
touching to her already conquered heart.</P>
<P>Indiana, meanwhile, began ere long, to catch
&s;ome of the plea&s;ure &s;he in&s;pired. The pa&s;&s;ionate
animation of Melmond, &s;oon not only re&s;umed its
fir&s;t power, but became even e&s;&s;ential to her. No
one el&s;e had yet &s;eemed to think her &s;o completely
a godde&s;s, except Mr. Macder&s;ey, whom &s;he &s;carce
expected ever to &s;ee again. With Melmond &s;he
could do nothing that did not make her appear to
him &s;till more lovely: and though her whims, thus
indulged, became almo&s;t endle&s;s, they but kindled
with fre&s;h flame his admiration. If &s;he fretted, he
thought her all &s;en&s;ibility; if &s;he pouted, all digni|ty;
if her laughter was unmeaning, &s;he was made
up of innocent gaiety: if what &s;he &s;aid was &s;hallow,
he called her the child of pure nature; if &s;he were
angry, how becoming was her &s;pirit! if illiberal,
how noble was her frankne&s;s! her per&s;on charmed
his eye, but his own imagination framed her mind,
and while his enchanted faculties were the mere
&s;laves of her beauty, they per&s;uaded them&s;elves they
were vanqui&s;hed by every other perfection.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold had not yet related Edgar's defec|tion
to Sir Hugh; though from the moment the
time of hope was pa&s;t, he wi&s;hed to end that of
expectation. But the pre&s;&s;ure of the affairs of
Lionel detained him at Etherington, and he could
not bear to give grief to his brother, till he could
&s;often its effect by the con&s;olation of &s;ome re&s;idence
at Cleves. This time now arrived; and the next
day was fixed for his painful ta&s;k, in which he
meant to &s;pare Camilla any &s;hare, when Jacob
<PB N="180" REF="7">
begged immediate admittance into the &s;tudy,
where Mr. Tyrold and his daughters were drink|ing
tea.</P>
<P>His &s;cared look in&s;tantly announced ill news.
Mr. Tyrold was alarmed, Lavinia was frightened,
and Camilla exclaimed, &startq;Jacob, &s;peak at once.!&endq;</P>
<P>He begged to &s;it down.</P>
<P>Camilla ran to get him a chair.</P>
<P>&startq;Is my brother well, Jacob?&endq; cried Mr. Tyrold.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, pretty well, con&s;idering, Sir,&mdash;but
the&s;e are va&s;t bad times for us!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O! if my uncle is but well,&endq; cried Camilla,
relieved from her fir&s;t dreadful doubt, &startq;all, I
hope, will do right!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, ay, Mi&s;s,&endq; &s;aid Jacob, &s;miling, &startq;I
knew you'd be ma&s;ter's be&s;t comfort; and &s;o I
told him, and &s;o he &s;ays, for that matter him&s;elf,
as I've got to tell you from him. But, for all that,
he takes on prodigious bad. I never &s;aw him in
the like way, except ju&s;t that time when Mi&s;s
Geny had the &s;mall pox.&endq;</P>
<P>They all &s;upplicated him to forbear further com|ments,
and then gathered, that a money-agent,
employed by young Lynmere, had ju&s;t arrived at
Cleves; where, with bitter complaints, he related
that, having been duped into believing him heir to
Sir Hugh Tyrold, he had been prevailed with to
grant him money, from time to time, to pay cer|certain
bills, contracted not only there, but in
London, for goods &s;ent thence by his order, to the
amount of near thirteen hundred pounds, without
the intere&s;t, of which he &s;hould give a &s;eparate
account; that he had vainly applied to the young
gentleman for re-imbur&s;ement, who finally a&s;&s;ured
him he was ju&s;t di&s;inherited by his uncle. No
hope, therefore, remained to &s;ave him from the
ruin of this affair, but in the compa&s;&s;ion of the
Boronet, which he now came to mo&s;t humbly
&s;olicit.</P>
<P><PB N="181" REF="8">
While Mr. Tyrold, in &s;ilent &s;urpri&s;e and con|cern,
li&s;tened to an account that placed his brother
in difficulties &s;o &s;imilar his own, Camilla, &s;inking
back in her chair, looked pale, looked almo&s;t life|le&s;s.
The hi&s;tory of the debts &s;he already knew,
and had daily expected to hear; but the circum|&s;tance
of the money lender, and the de$u&s;ion con|cerning
the inheritance, &s;o re&s;embled her own ter|rible,
and yet unknown &s;tory, that &s;he felt per|&s;onally
involved in all the &s;hame and horror of the
relation.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, who believed her &s;uffering all for
her uncle, made further enquiries, while Lavinia
tenderly &s;u&s;tained her, &startq;Don't take on &s;o, dear
Mi&s;s,&endq; &s;aid Jacob, &startq;for all our hope is in you,
as Ma&s;ter and I both &s;aid; and he bid me tell your
papa, that if he'd only give young 'Squire Man|dlebert
a jog, to egg him on, that he might no$
be &s;o &s;hilly &s;hally, as &s;oon as ever the wedding's
over, he'd accept his kind invitation to Beech
Park, and bide there till he got clear, as one
may &s;ay.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now required no a&s;&s;igned motive for
the exce&s;&s;ive di&s;tre&s;s of his daughter, and ha&s;tened
to turn Jacob from this too terribly trying &s;ub|ject,
by &s;aying, &startq;My brother then means to pay
the&s;e demands?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lauk, yes, Sir! his honour pays every thing
as any body a&s;ks him; only he &s;ays he don't know
how, becau&s;e of having no more money, being
&s;o hard run with all our preparations we have
been making this la&s;t fortnight.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, with every moment encrea&s;ing agita|tion,
hid her face again&s;t Lavinia; but Mr.
Tyrold, with &s;ome energy, &s;aid: The intere&s;t, at
lea&s;t, I hope he will not di&s;charge; for tho&s;e dan|gerous
vultures, who lie in wait for the weak or
erring, to encourage their frailties or vices, by
affording them means to pur&s;ue them, de&s;erve
much &s;everer puni&s;hment than merely lo&s;ing a
recompence for their iniquitous &s;nares.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="182" REF="9">
This was quite too much for the already di&s;or|ordered
Camilla; &s;he quitted her &s;i&s;ter, glided out
of the room, and delivered her&s;elf over as a prey
no longer to &s;orrow but remor&s;e. Her conduct
&s;eemed to have been preci&s;ely the conduct of
Clermont, and &s;he felt her&s;elf dreadfully implicated
as one of the <HI>weak or erring,</HI> guilty of <HI>frailties or vices.</HI></P>
<P>That an uncle &s;o dearly loved &s;hould believe &s;he
was forming an e&s;tabli&s;hment which would afford
him an a&s;ylum during his difficulties, now every
pro&s;pect of that e&s;tabli&s;hment was over, was &s;o
heart-piercing a circum&s;tance, that to her father
it &s;eemed &s;ufficient for the whole of what &s;he en|dured.
He made her over, therefore, to Lavinia,
while he ha&s;tened to Cleves; for Jacob, when he
had &s;aid all he was ordered to &s;ay, all he had ga|thered
him&s;elf, and all he was able to &s;ugge&s;t,
fini&s;hed with letting him know that his ma&s;ter
begged he would &s;et out that very moment.</P>
<P>The time of his ab&s;ence was &s;pent by Camilla
in an angui&s;h, that at his return, &s;eemed quite to
have changed her. He was alarmed, and redoubled
his tenderne&s;s; but his tenderne&s;s was no longer
her joy. He knows not, &s;he thought, whom he
care&s;&s;es; knows not that the wounds ju&s;t beginning
to heal for the &s;on, are &s;oon to be again opened for
the daughter!</P>
<P>Yet her affections were all awake to enquire
after her uncle; and when &s;he heard that nothing
could &s;o much &s;ooth him as her &s;ight, all fear of
his comments, all terror of exertion, &s;ub&s;ided in
the po&s;&s;ible chance of con&s;oling him: and Mr.
Tyrold, who thought every act of duty led
to chearfulne&s;s, &s;ent to de&s;ire the carriage might
fetch her the next morning.</P>
<P>He pa&s;&s;ed &s;lightly over to Camilla the &s;cene he
had him&s;elf gone through; but he confe&s;&s;ed to
Lavinia its difficulty and pain. Sir Hugh had ac|knowledged
he had drawn his bankers dry, yet
had merely current ca&s;h to go on till the next
quarter, whence he intended to deduct the further
<PB N="183" REF="10">
expences of the weddings. Neverthele&s;s, he was
determined upon paying every &s;hilling of the de|demand,
not only for the debts, but for all the
complicate intere&s;t. He would not li&s;ten to any
rea&s;oning upon this &s;ubject, becau&s;e, he &s;aid, he
had it upon his con&s;cience that the fir&s;t fault was
his own, in letting poor Clermont leave the king|dom,
without clearing up to him that he had made
Eugenia his exclu&s;ive heire&s;s. It was in vain Mr.
Tyrold pointed out, that no future hopes of wealth
could exculpate this unauthorized extravagance in
Clermont, and no di&s;&s;ipation in Clermont could
apologize for the clande&s;tine in Clermont could
apologize for the clande&s;tine loan, and its illegal
intere&s;t: &startq;The poor boy,' &s;aid he, did it all,
knowing no better, which how can I expect, when
I did wrong my&s;elf, being his uncle? Though if I
were to have twenty more nephews and nieces in
future, the fir&s;t word I &s;hould &s;ay to them would
be to tell them I &s;hould give them nothing; to the
end that having no hope, they might all be happy
one as another.&endq; All, therefore, that was left for
Mr. Tyrold, was to coun&s;el him upon the be&s;t
and &s;horte&s;t means of rai&s;ing the &s;um; and for this
purpo&s;e, he meant to be with him again the next
day.</P>
<P>This affair, however, with all its reproach for
the pa&s;t&punc; and all its &s;acrifices for the time to come,
by no means &s;o deeply affected Sir Hugh as the
blow Mr. Tyrold could no longer &s;pare concern|ing
Edgar. It &s;unk to his heart, di&s;pirited him
to tears, and &s;ent him, extremely ill, to bed.</P>
<P>The chai&s;e came early the next morning, and
Mr. Tyrold had the plea&s;ure to &s;ee Camilla exert
her&s;elf to appear le&s;s &s;ad. Lavinia was al&s;o of the
party, as he meant to &s;tay the whole day.</P>
<P>Eugenia met them in the hall, with the welcome
intelligence that Sir Hugh, though he had pa&s;&s;ed a
wretched night, was now &s;omewhat better, and
con&s;iderably cheared, by a vi&s;it from his old York|&s;hire
friend, Mr. We&s;twyn.</P>
<P>Neverthele&s;s, Sir Hugh di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him, and eve|ry
body el&s;e, to receive Camilla alone.</P>
<P><PB N="184" REF="11">
She endeavoured to approach him calmly, but his
own unchecked emotions &s;oon over&s;et her borrowed
fortitude, and the interview proved equally afflicting
to both. The cruel mi&s;chiefs brought upon him by
Clermont, were as nothing in the balance of his mi&s;|fortunes,
when oppo&s;ed to the &s;ight of &s;orrow upon
that face which, hitherto, had &s;o con&s;tantly enlivened
him as an image of joy: and with her, every &s;elf-di&s;appointment
yielded, for the moment, to the regret
of lo&s;ing &s;o precious a ble&s;&s;ing, as offering a refuge,
in a time of difficulty, to an uncle &s;o dear to her.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold would not &s;uffer this &s;cene to be long
uninterrupted; he entered, with a chearing counte|nance,
that compelled them to dry their tears, and
told them the We&s;twyns could not &s;o much longer be
le&s;t out, though they remained, well contented, for
the pre&s;ent, with Mi&s;s Margland and his other daugh|ters.
&startq;Melmond and Indiana,&endq; added he, &s;miling,
&startq;&s;eem at pre&s;ent not beings of this lower &s;phere, nor
to have a moment to &s;pare for tho&s;e who are.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That, my dear brother,&endq; an&s;wered the Baronet,
&startq;is all my comfort; for as to all the re&s;t of my mar|rying,
you &s;ee what it's come to! who could have
thought of young Mr. Edgar's turning out in the &s;ame
way? I can't &s;ay but what I take it pretty unkind of
him, letting me prepare at this rate for nothing; be|&s;ides
Beech Park's being within but a &s;tone's throw,
as one may &s;ay, as well as his own agreeablene&s;s.
However, now l've &s;een a little more of the world,
I can't &s;ay I find much difference between the good and
the bad, with re&s;pect to their all doing alike. The
young boys now-a-days, whatever's come to 'em,
don't know what they'd be at. They think nothing of
di&s;appointing a per&s;on if once they have a mind to
change their minds. All one's preparations go for
nothing; which they never think of.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now prevailed for the re-admi&s;&s;ion of
Mr. We&s;twyn, who was accompanied by his &s;on, and
followed by the Cleves family.</P>
<P>The cheeks of Camilla recovered their u&s;ual hu$
at the &s;ight of Henry, from the various intere&s;ting
<PB N="185" REF="12">
recollections which occurred with it. She was &s;een
her&s;elf with their original admiration, both by the
father and the &s;on, though with the former it was now
mingled with anger, and with the latter no longer
gilded with hope. Yet the complaints again&s;t her,
which, upon his arrival, Mr. We&s;twyn meant to make,
were &s;oon not merely relinqui&s;hed, but transformed
into pity, upon the view of her dejected countenance,
and &s;ilent melancholy.</P>
<P>The Baronet, however, revived again, by &s;eeing
his old friend, who&s;e humour &s;o much re&s;embled his
own, that, in York&s;hire, he had been always his fir&s;t
favourite. Each the children of untutored nature, ho|ne&s;t
and open alike in their words and their dealings,
their characters and their propen&s;ities were nearly the
&s;ame, though Sir Hugh, more &s;elf-formed, had a lan|guage
and manner of his own; and Mr. We&s;twyn, of
a temper le&s;s equal and le&s;s gentle, gave way, as they
aro&s;e, to &s;uch angry pa&s;&s;ions as the indulgent Baronet
never felt.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear friend,&endq; &s;aid Mr. We&s;twyn, &startq;you
don't take much notice of my Hal, though, I'll give you
my word, you won't &s;ee &s;uch another young fellow
every day. However, it's as well not, before his
face, for it might only make him think him&s;elf &s;ome|body:
and that, while I am alive, I don't intend he
&s;hould do. I can't bear a young fellow not dutiful.
I've always a bad opinion of him. I can't &s;ay he
plea&s;es me.</P>
<P>&startq;My dear We&s;twyn,&endq; an&s;wered the Baronet, &startq;I've
no doubt but what ma&s;ter Hal is very good, for which
I am truly glad. But as to much over rejoicing, now,
upon the &s;core of young boys, it's what I can't do,
&s;eeing they've turned out &s;o ill, one after another, as
far as I have had to do with them: for which, how|ever,
I hope I bear 'em no malice: They've enough
to an&s;wer for without that, which, I hope, they'll
think of in time.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why to be &s;ure, Sir Hugh, if you &s;et about
thinking of a young fellow by the pattern of my friend
Clermont, I can't &s;ay I'm much &s;urpri&s;ed you don't
<PB N="186" REF="13">
care to give him a good word; I can't &s;ay I am. I
am pretty much of the &s;ame way of thinking. I love
to &s;peak the truth.&endq; He then took Mr. Tyrold apart;
and ran on with a hi&s;tory of all he had gathered, while
at Leip&s;ie, of the conduct and way of life of Cler|mont
Lynmere. &startq;He was a di&s;grace,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;even
to the Engli&s;h name, as a Profe&s;&s;or told me, that I
can't remember the name of, it's &s;o prodig$ous long;
but, if it had not been for my &s;on, he told me, they'd
have thought all the Engli&s;h young fellows good for
nothing, except extravagance, and eating and drink|ing&punc;
`They'd all round have got an ill name,' &s;ays
he, `if it had not been for your &s;on,' were his words
which I &s;hall never forget. I &s;ent him over a noble
pipe of Madeira, which I'd ju&s;t got for my&s;elf, as
&s;oon as I came home. I took to him very much, I
can't &s;ay but I did; he$ was a very good man; he had
prodigiou&s;ly the look of an Engli&s;hman. He &s;aid Ha$
was an ornament to the univer&s;ity. I took it very well
of him. I wi&s;h he ha$ not &s;uch a hard name. I can
never call it to mind. I hate a hard name. I can
never &s;peak it without a blunder.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh now, who had been talking with Henry,
called upon Mr. We&s;twyn, to beg his pardon for not
&s;peaking of him more re&s;pectfully, &s;aying: &startq;I &s;ee
he's quite agreeable, which I &s;hould have noticed from
the fir&s;t, only being what I did not know; which I
hope is my excu&s;e; my head, my dear friend, not
getting on much, in point of quickne&s;s: though I can't
&s;ay its for want of pains, &s;ince you and I u&s;ed to live
&s;o much together; but to no great end, for I always
find my&s;elf in the back, however it happens; which
your &s;on, Ma&s;ter Hal, is, I &s;ee, quite the contrary.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;twyn was &s;o much gratified by this prai&s;e,
that he immediately confe&s;&s;ed the &s;cheme and wi&s;h he
had formed of marrying Hal to Camilla, only for her
not approving it. Sir Hugh prote&s;ted nothing could
give him more plea&s;ure than &s;uch a connexion, and &s;ig|nificantly
added, he had other nieces, be&s;ides Camilla.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, yes,&endq; &s;aid Mr. We&s;twyn, &startq;and I can't
keep from looking at 'em; I like 'em all mightily.
<PB N="187" REF="14">
I'm a great friend to taking from a good &s;tock. I chu&s;e
to know what I'm about. That girl at Southampton
hit my fancy prodigiou&s;ly. But I'm not for the beau|ty.
A beauty won't make a good wife. It takes her
too much time to put her cap on. That little one,
there, with the hump, which I don't mind, nor the
limp, neither, I like va&s;tly. But I'm afraid Hal
won't take to her. A young man don't much fancy an
ugly girl. He's always hankering after &s;omething
pretty. There's that other indeed, Mi&s;s Lavinia, is
as hand&s;ome a girl as I'd wi&s;h to &s;ee. And &s;he &s;eems
as good, too. However, I'm not for judging all by
the eye. I'm pa&s;t that. An old man &s;hould not play
the fool&punc; Which I wi&s;h &s;omebody would whi&s;per to
a certain Lord that I know of, that don't behave quite
to my mind. I'm not fond of an old fo$l; nor a
young one neither. They make me &s;ick.&endq;</P>
<P>Sir Hugh heard and agreed to all this, with the
&s;ame &s;implicity with which it was &s;poken; and, &s;oon
after, York&s;hire becoming their them$, Mr. Tyrold
had the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing his brother &s;o much re|animated
by the revival of old &s;cenes, ideas, and con|nexions,
that he heartily joined in pre&s;&s;ing the Mr.
We&s;twyns to &s;pend a fortnight at Cleves, to which
they con&s;ented with plea&s;ure.</P>
</DIV1>

<HEAD>CHAP. XX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Bride's Re&s;olves.</HEAD>
<P>WITH every allowance for a grief in which &s;o
deeply he &s;hared, Mr Tyrold felt nearly bowed down
with &s;orrow, when he ob&s;erved his own tenderne&s;s
abate of its power to con&s;ole, and his exhortations of
their influence with his mi&s;erable daughter, who&s;e
complicated afflictions &s;eemed de&s;perate to her&s;elf, and
to him nearly hopele&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="188" REF="15">
He now began to fear the rigid oeconomy and re|tirement
of their pre&s;ent lives might add &s;ecret di&s;gu&s;t
or fatigue to the di&s;appointment of her heart. He
&s;ighed at an idea &s;o little in uni&s;on with all that had
hitherto appeared of her di&s;po&s;ition; yet remembered
&s;he was very young and very lively, and thought that,
if caught by a love of gayer &s;cenes than Ethering$$
afforded, &s;he was at a &s;ea&s;on of life which brings its
own excu&s;e for &s;uch venial ambition.</P>
<P>He mentioned, therefore, with great kindne&s;s, their
exclu&s;ion from all &s;ociety, and propo&s;ed making an ap|plication
to Mrs. Needham, a lady high in the e&s;teem
of Mrs. Tyrold, to have the goodne&s;s to take &s;he
charge of carrying them a little into the world, dur|ing
the ab&s;ence of their mother. &startq;I can neither
exact nor de&s;ire,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;to &s;eque&s;ter you from all
amu&s;ement for a term &s;o utterly indefinite as that of
her re&s;toration; &s;ince it is now more than ever de&s;ira|ble
to regain the favour of your uncle Relvil for Lio|nel,
who has re&s;i&s;ted every profe&s;&s;ion for which I
have &s;ought to prepare him; though his idle and li|centious
cour&s;es &s;o little fit him for contentment with
the &s;mall patrimony he will one day inherit.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters mutually and &s;incerely declined this
propo&s;ition; Lavinia had too much employment to find
time ever &s;low of pa&s;&s;age; and Camilla, joined to the
want of all &s;pirit for recreation, had a dread of appear|ing
in the county, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould meet with Sir Sedley
Clarendel, who&s;e two hundred pounds were among&s;t
the evils ever pre&s;ent to her. The money which
Eugenia meant to &s;ave for this account had all been
given to Lionel; and now her marriage was at an
end, and no particular &s;um expected, &s;he mu&s;t be ve|ry
long in replacing it; e&s;pecially as Jacob was fir&s;t
to be con&s;idered; though he had kindly prote&s;ted he
was in no ha&s;te to be paid.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold was not &s;orry to have his propo&s;ition
declined; yet &s;aw the &s;adne&s;s of Camilla unabated,
and &s;ugge&s;ted, for a tran&s;ient diver&s;ity, a vi&s;it to the
Grove; enquiring why an acquaintance begun with &s;o
much warmth and plea&s;ure, &s;eemed thus utterly relin|qui&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="189" REF="16">
Camilla had her&s;elf thought with &s;hame of
her apparently ungrateful neglect of Mrs. Arlbery;
but the five guineas &s;he had borrowed, and forgotten to
pay, while &s;he might yet have a&s;ked them of Sir
Hugh, and which now &s;he had no ability any where
to rai&s;e, made the idea of meeting with her painful.
And thus, overwhelmed with regret and repentance
for all around, her &s;pirits gone, and her heart &s;unk,
&s;he de&s;ired never more, except for Cleves, to &s;tir from
Etherington.</P>
<P>Had he &s;een the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of her revival, Mr.
Tyrold would have been gratified by her &s;trengthened
love of home; but this was far from being the ca&s;e;
and, upon the marriage of Mi&s;s Dennel, which was
now celebrated, he was glad of an opportunity to
force her abroad, from the nece&s;&s;ity of making a con|gratulatory
vi&s;it to the bride's aunt, Mrs. Arlbery.</P>
<P>The chariot, therefore, of Sir Hugh being borrow|ed,
&s;he was compelled into this exertion; &s;he was ill
repaid by her reception from Mrs. Arlbery, who, hurt
as well as offended by her long ab&s;ence and total &s;i|lence,
wore an air of the mo&s;t chilling coldne&s;s.
Camilla felt &s;orry and a&s;hamed, but too much di&s;turb|ed
to attempt any palliation for her non-appearance,
and remi&s;&s;ne&s;s of even a note or me&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>The room was full of morning vi&s;itors, all collect|ed
for the &s;ame complimentary purpo&s;e; but &s;he was
relieved with re&s;pect to her fears of Sir Sedley Cla|rendel,
in hearing of his tour to the Hebrides.</P>
<P>Her mournful countenance &s;oon, however, di&s;per&s;|ed
the anger of Mrs. Arlbery. &startq;What,&endq; cried &s;he,
&startq;has befallen you, my fair friend? if you are not
immea&s;urably unhappy, you are very &s;eriou&s;ly ill.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&mdash;no,&mdash;my &s;pirits&mdash;have not been good&mdash;&endq;
an&s;wered &s;he, &s;tammering;&mdash;&startq;but yours may, per|haps,
a&s;&s;i&s;t to re&s;tore them.&endq;</P>
<P>The compo&s;ition of Mrs. Arlbery had no particle of
either malice or vengeance; &s;he now threw off, there|fore,
all re&s;erve, and taking her by the hand, &s;aid:
&startq;&s;hall I keep you to &s;pend the day with me? Yes or
no? Peace or war?</P>
<P><PB N="190" REF="17">
And without waiting for an an&s;wer, &s;he &s;ent back
the chariot, and a me&s;&s;age to Mr. Tyrold, that &s;he
would carry home his daughter in the evening.</P>
<P>&startq;And now, my faithle&s;s Fair,&endq; cried &s;he, as &s;oon
as they were alone, &startq;tell me what has led you to this
abominable ficklene&s;s? with me, I mean! If you had
grown tired of any body el&s;e, I &s;hould have thought
nothing &s;o natural. But you know, I &s;uppo&s;e, that
the &s;ame thing we philo&s;ophi&s;e into an admirable good
joke for our neighbours, we morali&s;e into a crime
again&s;t our&s;elves.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I thought,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, attempting to &s;mile,
&startq;none but country coun&s;ins ever made apologies?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, now, I mu&s;t forgive you without one word
more!&endq; an&s;wered Mrs. Arlbery, laughing, and &s;haking
hands with her; &startq;a happy citation of one <HI>bon mot,</HI>
is worth any ten offences. So, you &s;ee, you have
nine to commit, in &s;tore, clear of all damages. But
the plea&s;ure of finding one has not &s;aid a good thing
only for once, thence to be forgotten and die away in
the winds, is far greater than you can yet a while con|ceive.
In the fir&s;t pride of youth and beauty, our at|tention
is all upon how we are looked at. But when
tho&s;e begin to be &s;omewhat on the wane&mdash;when that
barbarous time comes into play, which revenges upon
poor mi&s;erable woman all the airs &s;he has been playing
upon &s;illy man&mdash;our ambition, then, is how we are
li&s;tened to. So now, cutting &s;hort reproach and ex|cu&s;e,
and all the wearying round of explanation, tell
me a little of your hi&s;tory &s;ince we la&s;t met.&endq;</P>
<P>This was the la&s;t thing Camilla meant to undertake:
but &s;he began, in a he&s;itating manner, to &s;peak of her
little debt. Mrs. Arlbery, eagerly interruting her,
in&s;i&s;ted it &s;hould not be mentioned, adding, &startq;I go on
va&s;tly well again; I am breaking in two ponies, and
building a new phaeton; and I &s;hall &s;oon pay for both,
without the &s;malle&s;t inconvenience,&mdash;except ju&s;t pinch|ing
my &s;ervants, and &s;tarving my vi&s;itors. But tell
me &s;omething of your adventures. You are not half
&s;o communicative as Rumour, which has given me a
thou&s;and details of you, and married you and your
<PB N="191" REF="18">
whole &s;et to at lea&s;t half a dozen men a piece, &s;ince
you were la&s;t at the Grove. Among&s;t others, it a&s;|&s;erts,
that my old Lord Valhur&s;t was &s;eriou&s;ly at
your feet? That prating Mrs. Mittin, who fa&s;tened
upon my poor little niece at Tun$ridge, and who is
now her factotum, pretends that my lord's own &s;er|vants
&s;poke of it publicly at Mrs. Berlinton's.</P>
<P>This was a fact that, being thus divulged, a very
few que&s;tions made impo&s;&s;ible to deny; though Ca|milla
was highly &s;uperior to the indelicacy and ingra|titude
of repaying the preference of any gentleman,
by publi&s;hing his rejection.</P>
<P>&startq;And what in the world, my dear child,&endq; &s;aid
Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;could provoke you to &s;o wild an
action as refu&s;ing him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Good Heaven, Mrs. Arlbery!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, what&mdash;you were not in love with him? I
believe not!&mdash;but if he was in love with you, take
my word for it, that would have done quite as well.
'Tis &s;uch a little while that &s;ame love la&s;ts, even
when it is begun with, that you have but a$ few
months to lo&s;e, to be exactly upon a par with tho&s;e
who &s;et out with all the quivers of Cupid, darting
from heart to heart. He has &s;till fortune enough left
for a hand&s;ome &s;ettlement; you can't help out-living
him, and then, think but how delectable would be
your &s;ituation! Freedom, money at will, the choice
of your own friends, and the enjoyment of your own
humour!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You would but try me, my dear Mrs. Arlbery;
for you cannot, I'm &s;ure, believe me capable of ma|king
&s;o &s;olemn an engagement for &s;uch mercenary
hopes, and &s;elfi&s;h purpo&s;es.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is all the romance of fal&s;e rea&s;oning. You
have not &s;ought the man, but the man you. You
would not have &s;olicited his acceptance, but yielded
to his &s;olicitation of yours. The balance is always
ju&s;t, where force is not u&s;ed. The man has his rea|&s;ons
for chu&s;ing you; you have your rea&s;ons for &s;uf|fering
your&s;elf to be cho&s;en. What his are, you have
<PB N="192" REF="19">
no bu&s;ine&s;s to enquire; nor has he the &s;malle&s;t right
to inve&s;tigate yours.&endq;</P>
<P>This was by no means the &s;tyle in which Camilla
had been brought up to think of marrlage; and Mrs.
Arlbery pre&s;ently added: &startq;You are grave; yet I
&s;peak but as a being of the world I live in: though I
addre&s;s one that knows nothing about it. Tell me,
however, a little more of your affairs. What are all
the&s;e marriages and no marriages, our neighbourhood
is &s;o bu&s;y in making and unmaking?</P>
<P>Camilla returned the mo&s;t brief and quiet an&s;wers
in her power; but was too late to &s;ave the delicacy
of Eugenia in concealing her late double di&s;appoint|ments,
the abortive preparations of Sir Hugh having
travelled through all the adjoining country. &startq;Poor
little dear ugly thing!&endq; cried Mrs. Arlbery, &startq;&s;he
mu&s;t certainly go off with her footman;&mdash;unle&s;s, in|deed,
that good old pedant, who teaches her that va&s;t
quantity of &s;tuff &s;he will have to unlearn, when once
&s;he goes a little about, $word$ take compa&s;&s;ion upon her
and her thou&s;ands, and put them both into his own
pockets.&endq;</P>
<P>This raillery was painful nearly to di&s;gu&s;t to Camilla;
who frankly declared &s;he &s;aw her &s;i&s;ter with no eyes
but tho&s;e of re&s;pect and affection, and could not en|dure
to hear her mentioned in &s;o ridiculous a man|ner.</P>
<P>&startq;Never judge the heart of a wit,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he,
laughing, &startq;by the tongue! We have often as good
hearts, ay, and as much good nature, too, as the
careful profers who utter nothing but what is right,
or the heavy thinkers who have too little fancy to &s;ay
any thing that is wrong. But we have a plea&s;ure in
our own rattle that cruelly runs away with our di&s;|cretion.&endq;</P>
<P>She then more &s;eriou&s;ly apologized for what &s;he
had &s;aid, and declared her&s;elf an unaffected admirer
of all &s;he had heard of the good qualities of Eu|genia.</P>
<P><PB N="193" REF="20">
Other &s;ubjects were then taken up, till they were
interrupted by a vi&s;it from the young bride, Mrs.
Li&s;&s;in.</P>
<P>Jumping into the room, &startq;I'm ju&s;t run away,&endq; &s;he
cried, &startq;without &s;aying a word to any body! I or|dered
my coach my&s;elf, and told my own footman to
whi&s;per me when it came, that I might get off, with|out
&s;aying a word of the matter. Dear! how they'll
all &s;tare when they mi&s;s me! I hope they'll be fright|ened!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And why &s;o, you little chit? why do you want
to make them unea&s;y?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O! I don't mind! I'm &s;o glad to have my
own way, I don't care for any thing el&s;e. Dear, how
do you do, Mi&s;s Camilla Tyrold? I wonder you
have not been to &s;ee me! I had a great mind to have
invited you to have been one of my bride's maids.
But papa was &s;o mon&s;trous cro&s;s, he would not let
me do hardly any thing I liked. I was never &s;o glad
in my life as when I went out of the hou&s;e to be mar|ried!
I'll never a&s;k him about any one thing as long
as I live again. I'll always do ju&s;t what I chu&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And you are quite &s;ure Mr. Li&s;&s;in will never in|terfere
with that re&s;olution?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, I &s;ha'n't let him! I dare &s;ay he would
el&s;e. That's one rea&s;on I came out &s;o, ju&s;t now, on
purpo&s;e to let him &s;ee I was my own mi&s;tre&s;s. And
I told my coachman, and my own footman, and my
maid, all three, that if they &s;aid one word, I'd turn
'em all away. For I intend always to turn 'em away
when I don't like 'em. I &s;hall never &s;ay any thing
to Mr. Li&s;&s;in fir&s;t, for fear of his meddling. I'm
quite determined I won't be cro&s;&s;ed any more, now
I've &s;ervants of my own. I'm &s;ure I've been cro&s;&s;ed
long enough.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, turning to Camilla, &startq;Dear,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;how grave you look! Dear, I wonder you don't
marry too! When I ordered my coach, ju&s;t now, I
was ready to cry for joy, to think of not having to
a&s;k papa about it. And to-day, at breakfa&s;t, I dare
<PB N="194" REF="21">
&s;ay I rung twenty times, for one thing or another.
As fa&s;t as ever I could think of any thing, I went
to ringing again. For when I was at papa's, every
time I rang the bell, he always a&s;ked me what I
wanted. Only think of keeping one under &s;o!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what in the world &s;aid Mr. Li&s;&s;in to &s;o
prodigious an uproar?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, he &s;tared like any thing. But he could not
&s;ay much: I intend to u&s;e him to it from the fir&s;t,
that he may never plague me, like papa, with
a&s;king me what's the rea&s;on for every thing. If I
don't like the dinner to-day, I'll order a new one, to
be dre&s;&s;ed for me on purpo&s;e. And Mr. Li&s;&s;in, and
papa, and Mrs. Mittin, and the re&s;t of 'em, may eat
the old one. Papa never let me order the dinner at
home; he always would know what there was him&s;elf,
and have what he cho&s;e. I'm re&s;olved I'll have every
thing I like be&s;t, now, every day. I could not get
at the cook alone this morning, becau&s;e &s;o many of
'em were in the way; though I rung for her a dozen
times. But to-morrow, I'll tell her of &s;ome things
I intend to have the whole year through; in parti|cular,
currant $arts, and minced veal, and ma&s;hed
potatoes. I've been determined upon that the&s;e three
years, for again&s;t I was married.&endq;</P>
<P>Then, taking Camilla by the hand, &s;he begged &s;he
would accompany her to next room, &s;aying, &startq;Pray
excu&s;e me, aunt Arlbery, becau&s;e I want to talk to
Mi&s;s Tyrold about a &s;ecret.&endq;</P>
<P>When they came to another apartment, after care|fully
&s;hutting the door, &startq;Only think,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;Mi&s;s Camilla Tyrold, of my marrying Mr. Li&s;&s;n
at la&s;t! Pray did you ever &s;u&s;pect it? I'm &s;ure I did
not. When papa told me of it, you can't think how
I was &s;urpri&s;ed. I always thought it would have
been Colonel Andover, or Mr. Macder&s;ey, or el&s;e
Mr. Summers; unle&s;s it had been Mr. Wiggan, or
el&s;e your brother; but Mr. Li&s;&s;in never once came
into my head, becau&s;e of his being &s;o old. I dare
$ay he's &s;even and twenty! only think!&mdash;But I be|lieve
<PB N="195" REF="22">
he and papa had &s;ettled it all along, only papa
never told it me, till ju&s;t before hand. I don't like
him much; do you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have not the plea&s;ure to know him: but I hope
you will endeavour to like him better, now.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I don't much care whether I do or not, for I
&s;hall never mind him. I always determined never to
mind a hu&s;band. One minds one's papa becau&s;e one
can't help it: But only think of my being married
before you! though you're &s;eventeen years old&mdash;almo&s;t
eighteen&mdash;I dare &s;ay&mdash;and I'm only ju&s;t fifteen. I
could not help thinking of it all the time I was dre&s;|&s;ing
for a bride. You can't think how pretty my
dre&s;s was. Papa made Mrs. Mittin but it, becau&s;e,
he &s;aid, &s;he could get every thing &s;o cheap: but I
made her get it the deare&s;t &s;he could, for all that.
Papa's mon&s;trous &s;tingy.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;ecret conference was broken up by a violent
ringing at the gate, &s;ucceeded by the appearance of
Mr. Li&s;&s;in, who, without any ceremony, opened the
door of the chamber into which the ladies had re|tired.</P>
<P>&startq;So, ma'am!&endq; &s;aid he, vi&s;ibly very angry, &startq;I
have the plea&s;ure at la&s;t to find you! dinner has wait|ed
till it is &s;poilt, and I hope, therefore, now, you
will do us the favour to come and &s;it at the head of
your table.&endq;</P>
<P>She looked frightened, and he took her hand, which
&s;he had not courage to draw back, though in a voice
that &s;poke a &s;ob near at hand, &startq;I'm &s;ure,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;this is not being treated like a married woman!
and I'm &s;ure if I'd known I might not do as I like,
and come out when I'd a mind, I would not have mar|ried
at all!&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Li&s;&s;in, with little or no apology to Mrs. Arl|bery,
then conveyed his fair bride to her coach.</P>
<P>&startq;Poor &s;imple girl!&endq; exclaimed Mrs. Arlbery.
&startq;Mr. Li&s;&s;in, who is a country &punc;&s;quire of Northwick,
will &s;oon teach her another le&s;&s;on, than that of order|ing
her carriage ju&s;t at dinner time! The poor child
<PB N="196" REF="23">
took it into her head that, becau&s;e, upon marrying
&s;he might &s;ay, `my hou&s;e, my coach,' and `my
&s;ervants,' in&s;tead of `my papa's;' and ring her bell
for whom &s;he plea&s;ed, and give her own orders, that
&s;he was to arrive at complete liberty and independ|ence,
and that her hu&s;band had merely to give her
his name, and lodge in the &s;ame dwelling: and &s;he
will regard him &s;oon, as a tyrant and a brute, for
not letting her play all day long the part of a wild
&s;chool girl, ju&s;t come home for the holidays.&endq;</P>
<P>The re&s;t of the vi&s;it pa&s;&s;ed without further inve&s;ti|gation
on the part of Mrs. Arlbery, or embarra&s;&s;|ment
on that of Camilla; who found again &s;ome lit|tle
plea&s;ure in the conver&s;ation which, at fir&s;t, had
&s;o much charmed; and the kindne&s;s which even her
apparent neglect had not extingui&s;hed.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, in two days, claimed her again&punc;
Mr. Tyrold would not permit her to &s;end an excu&s;e,
and &s;he found that lady more kindly di&s;po&s;ed to her
than ever; but with an undi&s;gui&s;ed compa&s;&s;ion and
concern in her countenance and manner. She had
now learnt that Edgar was gone abroad; and &s;he had
learnt that Camilla had private debts, to the amount
of one hundred and eighteen pounds.</P>
<P>The &s;hock of Camilla, when &s;poken to upon this
&s;ubject, was terrible. She &s;oon gathered, &s;he had
been betrayed by Mrs. Mittin, who, though &s;he had
made the communication as a profound &s;ecret to Mrs.
Arlbery, with whom &s;he had met at Mrs. Li&s;&s;in's,
there was every rea&s;on to &s;uppo&s;e would whi&s;per it,
in the &s;ame manner, to an hundred per&s;ons be&s;ides.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery, &s;eeing her ju&s;t unea&s;ine&s;s, promi&s;ed,
in this particular, to obviate it her&s;elf&punc; by a confer|ence
with Mrs. Mittin, in which &s;he would repre&s;ent,
that her own ruin would be the con&s;equence of di|vulging
this affair, from the general opinion which
would prevail, that &s;he had &s;educed a young lady un|der
age, to having dealings with a u&s;urer.</P>
<P><PB N="197" REF="24">
Camilla, deeply colouring, accepted her kind offer;
but was forced upon a confe&s;&s;ion of the tran&s;action;
though with a &s;hame for her tru&s;t in &s;uch a character
as Mrs. Mittin, that made her deem the relation a pe|nance
almo&s;t adequate to its wrong.</P>

<P>THE vi&s;it of the We&s;twyns to Sir Hugh &s;hewe$
Lavinia in &s;o favourable a light, that nothing le&s;s than
the &s;trong prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion already conceived for Camilla
could have guarded the heart of the &s;on, or the wi&s;h|es
of the father, from the complete captivation of her
mode&s;t beauty, her intrin&s;ie worth, and the chearful
alacrity, and virtuous &s;elf-denial, with which &s;he pre|&s;ided
in the new oeconomy of the rectory. But though
the utter demolition of hope played with Henry its u&s;ual
part of demoli&s;hing, al&s;o, half the fervour of admira|tion,
he &s;till felt, in con&s;equence of his late failure&punc;
a di&s;ta&s;te of any &s;imilar attempt: and Mr. We&s;twyn,
unbribed by the high prai&s;e of his &s;on, which had
won him in Camilla, left him ma&s;ter of his choice.
Each, however, found a delight in the Tyrold &s;ociety,
that &s;econded the wi&s;hes of the Baronet to make them
lengthen their vi&s;it.</P>
<P>The retrenchments, by which the debts of Cler|mont
were to be paid, could no longer, neverthele&s;s,
be deferred; and Mr. Tyrold was ju&s;t &s;etting out for
Cleves, to give his coun&s;el for their arrangement, when
his daughters were broken in upon by Mrs. Mittin.</P>
<P>Camilla could &s;carcely look at her, for di&s;plea&s;ure
at her conduct; but &s;oon ob&s;erved &s;he &s;eemed her&s;elf
full of re&s;entment and ill humour. She de&s;ired a pri|vate
interview; and Camilla then found, that Mrs.
Arlbery had not only repre&s;ented her fault, and fright|ened
her with its con&s;equences, but occa&s;ioned, though
mo&s;t unde&s;ignedly, new di&s;turbances and new dangers
<PB N="198" REF="25">
to her&s;elf: for Mrs. Mittin at length learnt, in this
conference, with equal certainty, &s;urpri&s;e, and pro|vocation,
that the inheritance of Sir Hugh was po&s;i|tively
and entirely &s;ettled upon his younge&s;t niece;
and that the denials of all expectation on the part of
Camilla, which &s;he had always taken for clo&s;ene&s;s,
conveyed but the &s;imple truth. Alarmed le&s;t &s;he &s;hould
incur the anger of Mr. Clykes, who was among&s;t her
mo&s;t u&s;eful friends, &s;he had written him word of the
di&s;covery, with her concern at the mi&s;take: and Mr.
Clykes, judging now he had no chance of the gratu|ity
finally promi&s;ed for <HI>honour</HI> and <HI>&s;ecre&s;y,</HI> and even
that his principal was in danger, had &s;ent an enraged
an&s;wer, with an imperious declaration, that he mu&s;t
either immediately be repaid all he had laid out, or
receive &s;ome &s;ecurity for its being refunded, of higher
value than the note of a minor of no fortune nor ex|pectations.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin prote&s;ted &s;he did not know which way
to turn, &s;he was &s;o &s;orry to have di&s;obliged &s;o good a
friend; and br$ke forth into a vehement invective
again&s;t Mr. Dub&s;ter, for pretending he knew the truth
from young Squire Tyrold him&s;elf.</P>
<P>Long as was her lamentation, and &s;atisfied as &s;he
always felt to hear her own voice, her pau&s;e &s;till came
too &s;oon for any reply from Camilla, who now felt
the d$&s;covery of her &s;ituation to be inevitable, com|pul&s;atory
and di&s;graceful. Self-upbraidings that &s;he
had ever li&s;tened to &s;uch an expedient, a&s;&s;ailed her
with the cruelle&s;t poignancy, $ingling almo&s;t &s;elf-dete&s;tation
with utter de&s;pair.</P>
<P>In vain Mrs. Mittin pre&s;&s;ed for &s;ome &s;atisfaction;
&s;he was mute from inability to devi&s;e any; till the
coachman of Mr. Li&s;&s;in &s;ent word he could wait no
longer. She then, in a broken voice, &s;aid, &startq;Be &s;o
good as to wait to Mr. Clykes, that if he will have
$he patience to wa$ a few days, I will prepare my
$$$ends to &s;ettle my accounts with him.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Mitten then, recovering from her own fright
in this bu&s;ine&s;s, an&s;wered, &startq;O, if that's the ca&s;e, my
dear young lady, pray don't be unea$y, for it grieves
me to vex you; and I promi&s;e you I'll coax my good
<PB N="199" REF="26">
friend to wait &s;uch a matter as that; for he's a va&s;t
regard for me; he'll do any thing I a&s;k him, I know.&endq;</P>
<P>She now went away; and Lavinia, who ran to her
&s;i&s;ter, found her in a &s;tate of di&s;tre&s;s, that melted her
gentle heart to behold: but when &s;he gathered what
had pa&s;&s;ed, &startq;This di&s;clo&s;ure, my deare&s;t Camilla,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;can never be &s;o tremendous as the ince&s;|&s;ant
fear of its di&s;covery. Think of that, I conjure
you! and endeavour to bear the one great &s;hock, that
will lead to after peace and ea&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, my dear &s;i&s;ter, peace and ea&s;e are no more
for me!&mdash;My happine&s;s was already buried;&mdash;and
now, all that remain$d of con&s;olation will be cut off
al&s;o, in the lo&s;t good opinion of my father and mo|ther!
&mdash;that de&s;troyed&mdash;and Edgar gone&mdash;whas is life
to me?&mdash;I barely exi&s;t!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And is it po&s;&s;ible you can even a moment doubt
their forgivene&s;s? dear as you are to them, cheri&s;hed,
beloved!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No&mdash;not their forgivene&s;s&mdash;but their e&s;teem&mdash;
their confidence, their plea&s;ure in their daughter will
all end!&mdash;think, Lavinia, of my mother!&mdash;when &s;he
finds I, too, have contributed to the di&s;tre&s;s and di&s;|turbance
of my father&mdash;that on my account, too, his
&s;mall income is again &s;traitened, his few gratifications
are again dimini&s;hed&mdash;O Lavinia! how has &s;he &s;trove
to guard her poor tottering girl from evil! And how
has her fondne&s;s been always the pride of my life!
What a conclu&s;ion is this to her cares! what a reward
to all the goodne&s;s of my father!&endq;</P>
<P>In this &s;tate of de&s;perate wretchedne&s;s, &s;he was &s;till
incapable to make the avowal which was now become
indi&s;pen&s;able, and which mu&s;t require another loan
from the &s;tore her father held &s;o &s;acred. Lavinia had
even le&s;s courage; and they determined to apply to
Eugenia, who, though as &s;oftly-feeling as either,
mingled in her character a &s;ort of heroic philo&s;ophy,
that enabled her to execute and to endure the harde&s;t
ta&s;ks, where &s;he thought them the demand of virtue.
They re&s;olved, therefore, the next morning, to &s;end
<PB N="200" REF="27">
a note to Cleves for the carriage, and to commit the
affair to this inexperienced and youthful female &s;age.</P>
<P>Far from running, as &s;he was wont, to meet her
father upon his entrance, Camilla was twice &s;ent for
before &s;he cou'ld gain &s;trength to appear in his pre|&s;ence;
nor could his utmo&s;t kindne&s;s enable her to
look up.</P>
<P>The heart of Mr. Tyrold was penetrated by her
avoidance, and yet more &s;unk by her &s;ight. His be&s;t
hopes were all defeated of affording her parental com|fort,
and he was &s;till to &s;eek for her revival or &s;up|port.</P>
<P>He related what had pa&s;&s;ed at Cleves, with the
accu&s;tomed openne&s;s with which he conver&s;ed with
his children as his friends. Clermont, he &s;aid, was
arrived, and had authenticated all the accounts, with
&s;o little of either &s;hame or &s;en&s;e, that a character le&s;s
determined upon indulgence than that of Sir Hugh,
mu&s;t have revolted from affording him &s;uccour, if
merely to mortify him into repentance. The manner
of making payment, however, had been the difficult
di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of the whole day. Sir Hugh was unequal
to performing any thing, though ready to con&s;ent to
every thing. When he propo&s;ed the &s;ale of &s;everal
of his numerous hor&s;es, he objected, that what re|mained
would be hard worked: when he mentioned
dimini&s;hing his table, he was afraid the poor would
take it ill, as they were u&s;ed to have his orts: and
when he talked of di&s;charging &s;ome of his &s;ervants,
he was &s;ure they would think it very unkind. &startq;His
heart,&endq; continued Mr. Tyrold, &startq;is &s;o bountiful, and
&s;o full of kindne&s;s, that he pleads his tender feelings,
and regretting wi&s;hes, again&s;t the &s;ound rea&s;on of hard
nece&s;&s;ity. What is right, however, mu&s;t only in it|&s;elf
&s;eek what is plea&s;ant; and there, when it cea&s;es
to look more abroad, it is &s;ure to find it.&endq;</P>
<P>He &s;topt, hearing a deep &s;igh from Camilla, who
&s;ecretly ejaculated a prayer that this &s;entence might
live, henceforward, in her memory. He divined the
wi&s;h, wh$ch devoutly he cchoed, and continued:</P>
<P><PB N="201" REF="28">
&startq;There is &s;o little, in fine, that he could bear to
relinqui&s;h, that, with my utmo&s;t efforts, I could
not calculate any retrenchment, to which he will
agree, at more than an hundred a year. Yet his &s;cru|ples
concerning his vow re&s;i&s;t all the en$reaties of our
di&s;intere&s;ted Eugenia, to either &s;ell out for the &s;um,
or cut down any trees in York&s;hire. The&s;e difficul|ties,
too potent for his weak frame, were again &s;ink|ing
him into that de&s;pondence which we &s;hould all
&s;edulou&s;ly guard again&s;t, as the mo&s;t prevailing of foes
to active virtue, when, to relieve him, I made a
propo&s;al which my dear girls will both, I tru&s;t, find
peculiar plea&s;ure in &s;econding.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla had already &s;trove to rai&s;e her drooping
head, con&s;cience &s;truck at what was &s;aid of de&s;pond|ence;
and now endeavoured to join in the chearful
confidence expre&s;&s;ed by Lavinia, that he could not be
mi&s;taken.</P>
<P>&startq;The little hoard, into which already we have
broken for Lionel,&endq; he went on, &startq;I have offered to
lend him for pre&s;ent payment, as far as it will go,
and to receive it again at &s;tated periods. In the mean
while, I &s;hall accept from him the &s;ame intere&s;t as from
the bank. For this I am to have al&s;o &s;ecurity. I run no
ri&s;k of the little all I have to leave to my two girls.&endq;</P>
<P>He now looked at them both, expecting to &s;ee plea|&s;ure
even in Camilla, that what was de&s;tined, hereaf|ter,
for her&s;elf, could prove of the &s;malle&s;t utility to
Sir Hugh: but his di&s;appointment, and her &s;hock were
equal. Too true for the mo&s;t tran&s;itory di&s;gui&s;e, the
keene&s;t angui&s;h &s;hot from her eye; and Mr. Tyrold,
amazed, &s;aid: &startq;Is it Camilla who would draw back
from any &s;ervice to her uncle?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah no!&endq; cried &s;he, with cla&s;ped hands, &startq;I
would die to do him any good! and O!&mdash;that my
death at this momen$&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>She &s;topt, affrighted, for Mr. Tyrold frowned. A
frown upon a face &s;o con&s;tantly benign, was new, was
awful to her; but &s;he in&s;tantly recollected his con|demnation
of wi&s;hes &s;o de&s;perate, and fearfully taking
his hand, be&s;ought his forgivene&s;s.</P>
<P><PB N="202" REF="29">
His brow in&s;tantly re&s;umed its &s;erenity. &startq;I have
nothing,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;my deare&s;t child, to forgive,
from the moment you recollect your&s;elf. But try,
for your own &s;ake, to keep in mind, that the current
&s;orrows, however acute, of current life, are but u&s;e|le&s;sly
aggravated by vain wi&s;hes for death. The
&s;malle&s;t kind office better proves affection than any
words, however elevated.&endq;</P>
<P>The conference here broke up; &s;omething incom|prehen&s;ible
&s;eemed to Mr Tyrold to be blended with
the grief of Camilla; and though from her birth &s;he
had manife&s;ted, by every opportunity, the mo&s;t libe|ral
di&s;regard of wealth, the &s;omething not under&s;tood
&s;eemed always to have money for its object. What
this might be, he now fervently wi&s;hed to explore;
yet &s;till hoped, by patient kindne&s;s, to receive her
confidence voluntarily.</P>
<P>Camilla now was half dead; Lavinia could with
difficulty &s;u&s;tain, but by no po&s;&s;ible means revive her.
What a period was this to di&s;clo&s;e to her Father that
&s;he mu&s;t deprive him, in part, even of his promi&s;ed
&s;olace in his intended a&s;&s;i&s;tance to his brother, to &s;a|tisfy
debts of which he &s;u&s;pected not the exi&s;tence!</P>
<P>When forced down &s;tairs, by a &s;ummons to &s;upper,
Mr. Tyrold, to con&s;ole her for his momentary di&s;|plea&s;ure,
redoubled his care&s;&s;es; but his tenderne&s;s
only made her weep yet more bitterly, and he looked
at her with a heart rent with angui&s;h. For Lavinia,
for Eugenia, he would have felt &s;imilar grief; but
their far le&s;s gay, though equally innocent natures,
would have made the view of their affliction le&s;s &s;trik|ingly
oppre&s;&s;ive. Camilla had, hitherto, &s;eemed in
the &s;pring of joy yet more than of life. Anxiety
flew at her approach, and animation took its place.
Nothing could &s;hake his re&s;ignation; yet to behold
her con&s;tant &s;adne&s;s, &s;everely tried his fortitude. To
&s;ee tears trickling ince&s;&s;antly down the pale cheeks &s;o
lately blooming; to &s;ee her youthful countenance
wear the haggard expre&s;&s;ion of care; to &s;ee life, in
its wi&s;h and purpo&s;es &s;eem at an end, 'ere, in its
<PB N="203" REF="30">
ordinary calculation, it was reckoned to have begun,
drew him from every other con&s;ideration, and filled his
whole mind with monopolizing apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>He now him&s;elf pre&s;&s;ed her, for change of &s;cene,
to accept an invitation &s;he had received from Mrs.
Berlinton to Gro&s;venor Square, whither Indiana was
going in a few days, to &s;pend a fortnight or three
weeks before her marriage. But &s;he declined the ex|cur&s;ion,
as not more un&s;ea&s;onable in its expence, than
ungenial to her feelings.</P>
<P>The following morning, while they were at their
melancholy breakfa&s;t, a letter arrived from Li&s;bon,
which Mr. Tyrold read with vi&s;ible di&s;turbance, ex|claiming,
from time to time, &startq;Lionel, thou art in|deed
puni&s;hed!&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters were equally alarmed, but Lavinia alone
could make any inquiry.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold then informed them, their uncle Relvil
had ju&s;t acknowledged to their Mother, that he could
no longer, in ju&s;tice, conceal that, previou&s;ly to his
quitting England, he had privately married his hou&s;e|keeper,
to induce her to accompany him in his voy|age:
and that, during his fir&s;t wrath upon the detec|tion
of Lionel, he had di&s;$iherited him in &s;avour of
a little boy of her own, by a former marriage, whom
they had brought with them to Li&s;bon.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, though it had been his con&s;tant &s;tudy
to bring up his children without any reference to
their rich uncles, had never internally doubted, but
that the bachelor brother of Mrs. Tyrold would leave
his fortune to the &s;on of his only &s;i&s;ter, who was his
&s;ole near relation. And Lionel, he knew, in defiance
of his admonitions, had built upon it him&s;elf, rather
as a certainty than a hope. &startq;He will now &s;ee,&endq; &s;aid
Mr. Tyrold, &startq;his pre&s;umption, and feel, by what he
&s;uffers, what he has earned. Yet culpable as he has
been, he is now, al&s;o, unfortunate; and where crimes
are followed by puni&s;hment, it is not for mortal man
<PB N="204" REF="31">
to harbour unabating re&s;entment. I will write a few
lines of comfort to him.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, in this conce&s;&s;ion, experienced all &s;he
could feel of &s;atisfaction; but the &s;hort &s;en&s;ation died
away at the la&s;t words of the letter of her Mother,
which Mr. Tyrold read aloud.</P>
<P>&startq;You, I well know, will immediately in this
evil, find for your&s;elf, and impart to our children,
&s;omething of in&s;truction, if not of comfort. Shall I
recollect this without emulation? No, I will bear up
from this &s;troke, which, at lea&s;t, permits my return
to Etherington; where, in the bo&s;om of my dear fa|mily,
and &s;upported by its honoured chief, I will for|get
my voyage, my painful ab&s;ence, and my di&s;appoint|ment,
in exertions of practical oeconomy, &s;trict, but
not rigid, which our good children will vie with each
other to adopt: &s;edulous, all around, to &s;hew in what
we can mo&s;t forbear. I hope almo&s;t immediately to
claim my &s;hare in the&s;e labours, which &s;uch motives
will make light, and &s;uch companions render preci|ous.&endq;</P>
<P>In agony pa&s;t repre&s;&s;ion at the&s;e words, Camilla
glided out of the room. The return of her Mother
was now horror to her, not joy; her &s;hattered nerves
could not bear the interview, while under a cloud
threatening to bur&s;t in &s;uch a &s;torm; and &s;he entreat|ed
Lavinia to tell her Father that &s;he accepted his pro|po&s;al
for going to Mrs. Be$linton's: &startq;and there,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;Lavinia, I will wait, till Eugenia has
told the dreadful hi&s;tory that thus humbles me to the
du&s;t!&endq;</P>
<P>Lavinia was too timid to oppo&s;e rea&s;on to this &s;uf|fering;
and Mr. Tyrold, already cruelly apprehen&s;ive
the ob&s;curity of their reclu&s;e lives contributed to her
depre&s;&s;ion, and believing &s;he compared her pre&s;ent pri|vations
to the lo&s;t elegancies of Beech Park, &s;ighed
heavily, yet &s;aid he was glad &s;he would remove from
a &s;pot in which remini&s;cence was &s;o painful. This
was not, indeed, he added, the period he &s;hould have
&s;elected for her vi&s;iting the capital, or re&s;iding at Mrs.
Berlinton's; but &s;he was too much touched by the
<PB N="205" REF="32">
&s;tate of her family, not to be guarded in her expences;
and the pre&s;&s;ure of her even augmenting &s;adne&s;s, was
heavier upon his mind than any other alar$$.</P>
<P>The con&s;cience-&s;truck Camilla could make no pro|fe&s;&s;ion,
no promi&s;e; nor yet, though ardently wi&s;hing
it, refu&s;e his offered advance of her next quarter's al|lowance,
le&s;t &s;he &s;hould be reduced again to the nece&s;|&s;ity
of borrowing.</P>
<P>This &s;tep once decided, brought with it &s;omething
like a gloomy compo&s;ure&punc; &startq;I &s;hall avoid,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;at lea&s;t, with my Mother, the&s;e killing care&s;&s;es of
deluded kindne&s;s that break my heart with my Father.
She, too, would &s;oon di&s;cover there was &s;omething
darker in my &s;adne&s;s than even grief! She would be
&s;ure that even my exqui&s;ite lo&s;s could not render me
ungrateful to all condolement; &s;he would know that
a daughter whom &s;he had her&s;elf reared and in&s;tructed,
would blu&s;h &s;o uncea&s;ingly to publi&s;h any per&s;onal di&s;|appointment,
let her feel it how &s;he might. O my
loved Mother! how did the delight of knowing your
kind expectations keep me, while under your guidance
in the way I ought to go! O Mother of my heart!
what a grievous di&s;appointment awaits your &s;ad return!
To find, at the fir&s;t opening of your virtuous &s;chemes
of general &s;aving&mdash;that I, as well as Lionel, have in|volved
my family in debts&mdash;that I, as well as Cler|mont,
have committed them clande&s;tinely to a u&s;u|r$r!&endq;</P>
<P>Lavinia undertook to give Eugenia proper in&s;tructi|ons
for her commi&s;&s;ion; but news arrived, the next
day, that Sir Hugh would take no denial to Eugenia's
being her&s;elf of the party. This added not, how|ever,
to the courage of Camilla for &s;taying, and her
next determination was to reveal the whole by letter.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold would not &s;end her to Cleves to take
leave, that her uncle might not be tempted to exer|ci&s;e
his wonted, but now no longer convenient gene|ro&s;ity,
nor yet be expo&s;ed to the pain of withholding
it. &startq;You will go, now, my dear girl,&endq; he &s;aid,
&startq;in your p$i&s;tine &s;implicity, and what can &s;o every
way become you? It is not for a &s;cheme of plea&s;ure,
<PB N="206" REF="33">
but for a &s;timulus to mental exertion, I part with you.
When you return, your excellent Mother will aid
your ta&s;k, and reward its labour. Remember but,
while in your own hands, that open oeconomy, &s;pring|ing
from di&s;cretion, is always re&s;pected. It is fal&s;e
&s;hame alone that $egets ridicule.&endq;</P>
<P>Weeping and &s;ilent &s;he heard him, and his fears
gained ground that her di&s;appointment, joined to a
view of gayer life, had robbed Etherington of all
charms to her. Bitterly he regretted he had ever &s;uf|fered
her to leave his roof, though he would not now
force her &s;tay. Compul&s;ion could only detain her
per&s;on; and might heighten the di&s;gu&s;t of her mind.</P>
<P>The little time which remained was given wholly
to packing and preparing; and continued employment
hid from Mr. Tyrold her emotion, which encrea&s;ed
every moment, till the carriage of Sir Hugh &s;topt at
the gate. Lo&s;t, then, to all &s;en&s;ation, but the horror
of the avowal that mu&s;t intervene 'ere they met again,
with incertitude if again he would &s;ee her with the
&s;ame kindne&s;s, &s;he flew into his arms, rather agoni&s;ed
than affectionate; ki&s;&s;ed his hands with fervor, ki&s;&s;ed
every &s;eparate finger, re&s;ted upon his &s;houlder, hid
her face in his bo$om, caught and pre&s;&s;ed to her lips
even the &s;laps of his coat, and &s;carce re&s;trained her&s;elf
from bending to ki&s;s his feet; yet without uttering a
word, without even &s;hedding a tear.</P>
<P>Strangely &s;urpri&s;ed, and deeply affected, Mr. Ty|rold,
&s;training her to his brea&s;t, &s;aid: &startq;Why, my
dear child, why, my deare&s;t Camilla, if thus agitated
by our parting, do you leave me?&endq;</P>
<P>This que&s;tion brought her to recollection, by the
impo&s;&s;ibility &s;he found to an&s;wer it; &s;he tore her&s;elf,
therefore, away from him, embraced Lavinia, and hur|ried
into the coach.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Surpri&s;e.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA &s;trove to check her grief upon enter|ing
the carriage, in which Mi&s;s Margland had
again the charge of the young party; but the in|terrogatory
of her Father, <HI>Why will you leave me?</HI>
was mentally repeated without cea&s;ing. Ah! why,
indeed! thought &s;he, at a moment when every filial
duty called more than ever for my &s;tay!&mdash;Well
might he not divine the unnatural rea&s;on! can I
believe it my&s;elf?&mdash;Believe &s;uch an hour arrived?
&mdash;when my Mother&mdash;the be&s;t of Mothers!&mdash;is ex|pected
&mdash;when &s;he returns to her family, Camilla
&s;eeks another abode! is not this a dream? and may
I not one day awake from it?</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland was in the highe&s;t good humour
at this expedition: and Indiana was &s;till enraptured
to vi&s;it London, from old expectations which &s;he
knew not how to relinqui&s;h; though they were
fixed to no point, and as fanta&s;tic as vague. Euge|nia,
who&s;e dejection had made Sir Hugh pre&s;s her
into the party, found nothing in it to revive her;
and Camilla entered Gro&s;venor-&s;quare with keen
di&s;&s;atisfaction of every &s;ort. The cautions of Edgar
again&s;t Mrs Berlinton broke into all the little re|lief
&s;he might have experienced upon again &s;eeing
her. She had meant to keep his final exhortations
con&s;tantly in her mind, and to make all his opini|ons
and coun&s;els the rule and mea&s;ure of her con|duct:
but a cruel perver&s;ity of events &s;eemed to
ca&s;t her every action into an apparent defiance of
his wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who, in a man&s;ion the mo&s;t
&s;plendid, received her with the &s;ame gentle &s;weet|ne&s;s
&s;he had fir&s;t &s;ought her regard, was de|lighted
by the unexpected &s;ight of Eugenia, who&s;e
vi&s;it had been &s;ettled too late to be announced by
<PB N="208" REF="35">
letter; and care&s;&s;ed Indiana immediately as a &s;i&s;ter.
Mi&s;s Margland, who came but for two days, &s;ought
with much adulation to obtain an invitation for a
longer &s;tay; but Mrs. Berlinton, though all cour|te&s;y
and grace, incommoded her&s;elf with no &s;ociety
that &s;he did not find plea&s;ing.</P>
<P>Melmond, who had accompanied them on hor&s;e|back,
was eager to engage the kindne&s;s of his &s;i&s;ter
for Indiana; and Mrs. Berlinton, in compliment to
her arrival, refu&s;ed all parties for the evening, and
be&s;towed upon her an almo&s;t undivided attention.</P>
<P>This was not quite &s;o plea&s;ant to him in proof
as in hope. Pa&s;&s;ionle&s;s, in this ca&s;e, her&s;elf, the
delu&s;ions of beauty deceived not her under&s;tand|ing;
and half an hour &s;ufficed to &s;hew Indiana to be
frivolous, uncultivated, and unmeaning. The
perfection, neverthele&s;s, of her face and per&s;on,
obviated either wonder or cen&s;ure of the choice
of her brother; though &s;he could not but regret
that he had not &s;een with mental eyes the truly
&s;uperior Eugenia.</P>
<P>The wretched Camilla quitted them all as &s;oon
as po&s;&s;ible, to retire to her chamber, and rumi|nate
upon her purpo&s;ed letter. She meant, at
fir&s;t, to write in detail; but her difficulties accu|mulated
as &s;he weighed them. &startq;What a &s;ea&s;on,&endq;
cried &s;he, &startq;to &s;ink Lionel &s;till deeper in di&s;grace!
What a treachery, after voluntarily a&s;&s;i&s;ting him,
to complain of, and betray him! ah! let my own
faults teach me mercy for the faults of others!&endq;
yet, without this acknowledgment, what exculpa|tion
could &s;he offer for the origin of her debts?
and all &s;he had incurred at Tunbridge? tho&s;e of
Southampton &s;he now thought every way unpar|donable.
Even were &s;he to relate the vain hopes
which had led to the expence of the ball dre&s;s,
could &s;he plead, to an under&s;tanding like that of
her Mother, that &s;he had been deceived and played
upon by &s;uch a woman as Mrs. Mittin? &startq;I am
a&s;toni&s;hed now my&s;elf,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;at that pa&s;|&s;ive
facility!&mdash;but to me, alas, thought comes only
<PB N="209" REF="36">
with repentance!&endq; The Higden debt, both for
the rent and the &s;tores, was the only one at which
&s;he did not blu&s;h, &s;ince, great as was her indi&s;cre|tion,
in not enquiring into her powers before &s;he
plighted her &s;ervices, it would be palliated by her
motive.</P>
<P>Vainly &s;he took up her pen; not even a line
could &s;he write. &startq;How enervating,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;is all wrong!&endq; I have been, till now, a happy
&s;tranger to fear! Partially favoured, and fondly
confiding, I have looked at my dear Father, I have
met my beloved Mother, with the &s;ame courage,
and the &s;ame plea&s;ure that I looked at and met my
brother and my &s;i&s;ters, and only with more reve|rence.
How mi&s;erable a change! I &s;hudder now
at the pre&s;ence of the mo&s;t indulgent of Fathers!
I fly with guilty cowardice from the fonde&s;t of
Mothers!&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, when able, followed her; and had no
&s;ooner heard the whole hi&s;tory, than, tenderly
embracing her, &s;he &s;aid, &startq;Let not this di&s;tre&s;s
&s;eem &s;o de&s;perate to you, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter! your
own account points out to me how to relieve it,
without either betraying our poor Lionel, or fur|ther
weighing down our already heavily burthened
friends.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And how, my dear Eugenia?&endq; cried Camilla,
with fearful gratitude, and involuntarily reviving
by the mo&s;t di&s;tant idea of &s;uch a project.</P>
<P>By adopting, &s;he &s;aid, the &s;ame means that had
been invented by Mrs. Mittin. She had many
valuable trinkets, the annual offerings of her mu|nificent
uncle, the &s;ale of which would go far
enough, &s;he could not doubt, towards the payment
of the principal, to induce the money-lender to
accept intere&s;t for the re&s;t, till the general affairs
of their hou&s;e were re-e&s;tabli&s;hed; when what re|mained
of the &s;um could be di&s;charged, without
difficulty, by her&s;elf; now no longer wanting mo|ney,
nor capable of receiving any plea&s;ure from it,
but by the plea&s;ure &s;he might give.</P>
<P><PB N="210" REF="37">
Camilla pre&s;&s;ed her in her arms, almo&s;t kneeling
with fond acknowledgements, and accepted, with|out
he&s;itation, her generous offer.</P>
<P>&startq;All then, is arranged,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, with a
&s;mile &s;o benign, it &s;eemed nearly beautiful; &startq;and
to friend&s;hip, and each other, we will devote our
future days. My &s;pirits will revive in the revival
of Camilla. To &s;ee her again gay will be reno|vation
to my uncle; and who knows, my dear
&s;i&s;ter, but our whole family may again be ble&s;t,
'ere long, with peace?&endq;</P>
<P>The next morning they &s;ent off a note to the
money-lender, who&s;e direction Camilla had re|ceived
from Mrs. Mittin, entreating his patience
for a fortnight, or three weeks, when he would
receive the greate&s;t part of his money, with every
&s;pecies of acknowledgement.</P>
<P>Camilla, much relieved, went to &s;it with Mrs.
Berlinton, but on entering the dre&s;&s;ing room, was
&s;truck by the &s;ight of Bellamy, ju&s;t quitting it.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, upon her appearance, with a
look of &s;oft rapture approaching her, &s;aid: &startq;Feli|citate
me, lovelie&s;t Camilla!&mdash;my friend, my
cho&s;en friend is re&s;tored to me, and the &s;ociety for
which &s;o long I have &s;ighed in vain, may be once
more mine!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;tartled, exclaimed with earne&s;tne&s;s,
&startq;My deare&s;t Mrs. Berlinton, pardon me, I entreat
&mdash;but is Mr. Bellamy known to Mr. Berlinton?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No!&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, di&s;dainfully; &startq;but he
has been &s;een by him. Mr. Berlinton is a &s;tranger
to merit or ta&s;te; and Alphon&s;o, to him, is but as
any other man&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;They are, however, acquainted with each
other?&endq; &s;aid Camilla.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton an&s;wered, that, after her marri|age,
&s;he remained three months in Wales with her
aunt, where Bellamy was travelling to view the
country, and where, almo&s;t immediately after that
<PB N="211" REF="38">
unhappy enthralment, &s;he fir&s;t knew him, and fir&s;t
learnt the &s;oothing charms of friend&s;hip; but from
that period they had met no more, though they
con&s;tantly corre&s;ponded.</P>
<P>Camilla was now fir&s;t &s;en&s;ible of all the alarm
with which Edgar had hitherto &s;trove to impre&s;s
her in vain. The impropriety of &s;uch a connexi|on,
the danger of &s;uch a partiality, filled her with
wonder and di&s;turbance. She he&s;itated whether to
relate or not the adventure of Bellamy with her
&s;i&s;ter; but the &s;trong repugnance of Eugenia to
having it named, and the impo&s;&s;ibility of proving
the truth of the general opinion of his ba&s;e &s;cheme,
decided her to &s;ilence. Upon the plans and the
&s;entiments, however, of Mrs. Berlinton her&s;elf,
&s;he &s;pared not the extreme&s;t &s;incerity: but &s;he
gained no ground by the conte&s;t, though &s;he lo&s;t
not any kindne&s;s by the attempt.</P>
<P>At dinner, &s;he felt extremely di&s;turbed by the re|appearance
of Bellamy, who alone, &s;he found, had
been excepted by Mrs. Berlinton, in the orders of
general denial to company. He &s;eemed, him&s;elf,
much &s;truck at the &s;ight of Eugenia, who blu&s;hed
and looked embarra&s;&s;ed by his pre&s;ence. He did
not, however, addre&s;s her; he confined his attenti|ons
to Mrs. Berlinton, or Mi&s;s Margland.</P>
<P>The former received them with di&s;tingui&s;hing
&s;oftne&s;s; the latter, at fir&s;t, di&s;dainfully repelled
them, from the general belief at Cleves of his at|tempted
elopement with Eugenia; but afterwards,
finding &s;he was left wholly to a per&s;on who had no
re&s;ources for entertaining her, namely, her&s;elf,&mdash;
and knowing Eugenia &s;afe while immediately under
her eye, &s;he deigned to treat him with more con|&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The opera was propo&s;ed for the evening, Mrs.
Berlinton, having both tickets and her box at the
&s;ervice of her fair friends, as the lady with whom
whom &s;he had &s;ub&s;cribed was out of town. Indi|ana
was enchanted, Mi&s;s Margland was elevated,
and Eugenia not unwilling to &s;eek &s;ome recreation,
<PB N="212" REF="39">
though hopele&s;s of finding it. But Camilla, not|with&s;tanding
&s;he was lightened, at this moment,
from one of her mo&s;t corro&s;ive cares, was too en|tirely
mi&s;erable for any &s;pecies of amu&s;ement. The
&s;ame &s;trong feelings that gave to plea&s;ure, when
&s;he was happy, &s;o high a ze&s;t, rendered it nearly
abhorrent to her, when grief had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her
mind.</P>
<P>After dinner, when the ladies retired to dre&s;s,
Camilla, with &s;ome unea&s;ine&s;s, conjured Eugenia to
avoid renewing any acquaintance with Bellamy.</P>
<P>Eugenia blu&s;hing, while a tear &s;tarted into either
eye, &s;aid &s;he was but too well guarded from Bella|my,
through a late tran&s;action; which had exalted
her to a &s;ummit of happine&s;s, from which &s;he could
never now de&s;cend to any new plan of life, beyond
the &s;ingle &s;tate and retirement.</P>
<P>At night, the whole party went to the Opera,
except Camilla, who, in &s;pending the evening
alone, meant to ruminate upon her affairs, and ar|range
her future conduct: but Edgar, his virtues,
and his lo&s;s, took imperious po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all her
thoughts; and while &s;he dwelt upon his honour,
his &s;incerity, and his goodne&s;s, and traced, with
cheri&s;hed recollection, every &s;cene in which &s;he
had been engaged with him, he and they recurred
to her as vi&s;ions of all earthly felicity.</P>
<P>Awakened from the&s;e reveries, by the &s;ound of
the carriage, and the rapping at the &s;treet door,
&s;he was ha&s;tening down &s;tairs to meet her &s;i&s;ter,
when &s;he heard Melmond call out from the coach:
&startq;Is Mi&s;s Eugenia Tyrold come home?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No;&endq; the man an&s;wered; and Melmond ex|claimed;
&startq;Good Heaven!&mdash;I mu&s;t run then back
to the theatre. Do not be alarmed, my Indiana,
and do not alarm Mi&s;s Camilla, for I will not re|turn
without her.&endq;</P>
<P>They all entered but him&s;elf; while Camilla,
fixed to the &s;tair upon which &s;he had heard the&s;e
<PB N="213" REF="40">
words, remained &s;ome minutes motionle&s;s. Then,
tottering down to the parlour, with a voice hollow
from affright, and a face pale as death, &s;he tremu|lou&s;ly
articulated, &startq;where is my &s;i&s;ter?&endq;</P>
<P>They looked all agha&s;t, and not one of them,
for &s;ome time, was capable to give any account
that was intelligible. She then gathered that, in
coming out of the theatre, to get to the coach,
they had mi&s;&s;ed her. None of them knew how,
which way, in what manner.</P>
<P>&startq;And where's Mr. Bellamy?&endq; cried &s;he, in an
agony of apprehen&s;ion; &startq;was he at the Opera?
where&mdash;where is he?&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland looked di&s;mayed, and Mrs. Ber|linton
amazed, at this interrogatory; but they
both &s;aid he had only been in the box at the be|ginning
of the Opera, and afterwards to help them
out of the crowd.</P>
<P>&startq;And who did he help? who? who?&endq; exclaimed
Camilla.</P>
<P>&startq;Me,&mdash;fir&s;t&mdash;&endq; an&s;wered Mi&s;s Margland,&mdash;&endq;
and, when we got into a great crowd, he took care
of Mi&s;s Eugenia too.&endq; She then added, that in this
crowd, both &s;he and Eugenia had been &s;eparated
from Mrs. Berlinton and Indiana, who by Mel|mond
and another gentleman had been handed
&s;traight to the carriage, without difficulty; that
&s;oon after, &s;he had lo&s;t the arm of Bellamy, who,
by &s;ome mi&s;take, had turned a wrong way; but &s;he
got to the coach by her&s;elf; where they had wait|ed
full half an hour, Melmond running to and fro
and &s;earching in every direction, but in vain, to
find Eugenia. Nor had Bellamy again appeared.
They then came home, hoping he had put her into
a chair, and that &s;he might be arrived before them.</P>
<P>&startq;Dreadful! dreadful!&endq; cried Camilla, &s;inking
on the floor, &startq;&s;he is forced away! &s;he is lo&s;t!&endq;</P>
<P>When again her &s;trength returned, &s;he de&s;ired
that &s;ome one might go immediately to the hou&s;e
or lodgings of Bellamy, to enquire if he were come
home.</P>
<P><PB N="214" REF="41">
This was done by a footman, who brought word
he had not been &s;een there &s;ince &s;ix o'clock in the
evening, when he dre&s;&s;ed, and went out.</P>
<P>Camilla now, confirmed in her horrible &s;urmi&s;e,
was nearly frantic. She bewailed her &s;i&s;ter, her
father, her uncle; &s;he wanted her&s;elf to ru&s;h
forth, to &s;earch Eugenia in the &s;treets; &s;he could

<P>IT was four o'clock in the morning when Mel|mond
returned. Camilla ru&s;hed to the &s;treet door
to meet him. His &s;ilence and his mournful air an|nounced
his ill &s;ucce&s;s. She wrung her hands in
angui&s;h, and be&s;ought him to &s;end in&s;tantly an ex|pre&s;s

wrote:</P>
<P>&startq;O my Father&mdash;our Eugenia has di&s;appeared!
&s;he was lo&s;t la&s;t night at the Opera&mdash;Mr. Bellamy
was conducting her to Mrs. Berlinton's coach&mdash;
but we have &s;een neither of them &s;ince!&mdash;what&mdash;
what mu&s;t we do?&endq;</P>
<P>Melmond wrote the addre&s;s, which her hand
could not make legible; and Mi&s;s Margland pre|pared
for the po&s;t a laboured vindication to Sir
Hugh of her own conduct upon this occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Indiana was long gone to bed. She was really
very &s;orry; but &s;he was really much tired; and &s;he
could do, as &s;he &s;aid, no good.</P>
<P>But Mrs. Berlinton felt an alarm for Eugenia,
and an a&s;toni&s;hment concerning Bellamy, that
<PB N="215" REF="42">
would fully have wakened her faculties, had &s;he
been wholly unmoved by the mi&s;ery of Camilla.
Far other was, however, her nature, gentle, com|pa&s;&s;ionate,
and &s;ympathi&s;ing; and her own internal
di&s;turbance, though great even beyond her own
conception why, &s;unk at &s;ight of the exce&s;s of
wretchedne&s;s which di&s;ordered her poor friend.</P>
<P>There could be but one po&s;&s;ible opinion of this
di&s;a&s;trous adventure, which was, that Bellamy had
&s;pirited this young creature away, to &s;ecure her
fortune, by her hand. Melmond again went forth,
to make enquiry at all the &s;tables in London, for
any carriage that might have been hired for a late
hour. And at &s;ix o'clock, in great perturbation,
he came back, &s;aying, he had ju&s;t traced that &s;he
was put into a chai&s;e and four from a hackney
coach; that the chai&s;e was hired in Piccadilly, and
engaged for a week. He was now determined to
ride po&s;t him&s;elf in the pur&s;uit, that, if any acci|dental
delay retarded them, he might recover her
before &s;he arrived at Gretna Green, whither he
could not doubt &s;he was to be conveyed: but as &s;he
could not be married by force, his pre&s;ence might
yet be in time to prevent per&s;ecution, or foul play.</P>
<P>Camilla nearly embraced him with tran&s;port at
this ray of hope, and, leaving his tendere&s;t con|dolements
for Indiana, whom he implored his &s;i&s;ter
to watch &s;edulou&s;ly, he galloped northwards.</P>
<P>His heart was mo&s;t &s;incerely in the bu&s;ine&s;s;
what he owed to the noble conduct which the high
&s;entiments and pure regard of Eugenia had dictat|ed,
had excited a tender veneration, which made
him hold his life as too &s;mall an offering to be re|fu&s;ed
for her &s;ervice, if its &s;acrifice could e&s;&s;enti|ally
&s;hew his gratitude. And often his &s;ecret mind
had breathed a wi&s;h, that her love of literature had
been in&s;tilled into her cou&s;in; though he &s;tudiou&s;ly
checked, as profane, all that was not admiration of
that mo&s;t exqui&s;ite workman&s;hip of nature.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton wanted not to be told this pro|ceeding
was wrong, yet &s;till found it impo&s;&s;ible to
<PB N="216" REF="43">
per&s;uade her&s;elf Eugenia would not &s;oon think it
right; though Eugenia was the creature that &s;he
mo&s;t revered in the whole world, and though, with
Bellamy him&s;elf &s;he felt irritated and di&s;appointed.</P>
<P>Camilla in every evil reverted to the lo&s;s of
Edgar, who&s;e guardian care, had &s;he pre&s;erved
him, would have pre&s;erved, &s;he thought, her loved
Eugenia.</P>
<P>The expre&s;s from Etherington brought back
only a few lines written by Lavinia, with an ac|count
that Mr. Tyrold, in deep mi&s;ery, was &s;etting
out po&s;t for Scotland.</P>
<P>A week pa&s;&s;ed thus in &s;u&s;pen&s;e, nearly intolera|ble
to Camilla, before Melmond returned.</P>
<P>Always upon the watch, &s;he heard his voice, and
flew to meet him in the dre&s;&s;ing room. He was
at the feet of Indiana, to whom he was pouring
forth his ardent lamentations at this long depriva|tion
of her &s;ight.</P>
<P>But joy had evidently no part in his tenderne&s;s;
Camilla &s;aw at once depre&s;&s;ion and evil tidings,
and, &s;inking upon a chair, could &s;carcely pro|nounce,
&startq;Have you not then found her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I have left her but this minute,&endq; he an&s;wered,
in a tone the mo&s;t melancholy.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! you have then &s;een her! you have &s;een
my deare&s;t Eugenia?&mdash;O, Mr. Melmond, why have
you left her at all?&endq;</P>
<P>It was long before he could an&s;wer; he be&s;ought
her to compo&s;e her&s;elf; he expre&s;&s;ed the extreme&s;t
&s;olicitude for the unea&s;ine&s;s of Indiana, who&s;e eter|nal
interruptions of &startq;Dear! where is &s;he?&mdash;
Dear! why did not &s;he come back?&mdash;Dear! who
took her away?&endq; he attributed to the agitation of
the fonde&s;t friend&s;hip, and conjured, while tears of
terror &s;tarted into his eyes, that &s;he would mode|rate
the exce&s;s of her &s;en&s;ibility. It &s;eems the pe|culiar
province of the lover to transfu&s;e all that he
him&s;elf mo&s;t prizes, and thinks prai&s;e-worthy,
into the brea&s;t of his cho&s;en object; nor is he more
blind to the defects with which &s;he may abound,
<PB N="217" REF="44">
than prodigal in gifts of virtues which exi&s;t but in
his own admiration.</P>
<P>&startq;And my Father? my poor Father!&endq; cried
Camilla, &startq;you have &s;een nothing of my Father?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Pardon me; I have ju&s;t left him al&s;o.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And not with Eugenia?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes; they are together.&endq;</P>
<P>Rapture now defied all apprehen&s;ion with Ca|milla;
the idea of Eugenia re&s;tored to her Father,
was an idea of entire happine&s;s; but her joy affect|ed
Melmond yet more than her alarm: he could
not let her fa&s;ten upon any fal&s;e expectations; he
bid his &s;i&s;ter aid him to &s;upport Indiana, and then,
with all the gentlene&s;s of the &s;incere&s;t concern,
confe&s;&s;ed that Eugenia was married before &s;he was
overtaken.</P>
<P>This was a blow for which Camilla was &s;till un|prepared.
She concluded it a forced marriage;
horror froze her veins, her blood no longer flow|ed,
her heart cea&s;ed to beat, &s;he fell lifele&s;s on the
ground.</P>
<P>Her recovery was more &s;peedy that it was hap|py,
and &s;he was a&s;&s;i&s;ted to her chamber, no longer
a&s;king any que&s;tions, no longer de&s;iring further
information. All was over of hope: and the par|ticulars
&s;eemed immaterial, &s;ince the cata&s;trophe
was as irrever&s;ible as it was afflicting.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton &s;till attended her, grieved for her
&s;uffering, yet believing that Eugenia would be the
happie&s;t of women; though an indignation the
mo&s;t forcible mingled with her &s;urpri&s;e at the con|duct
of Bellamy.</P>
<P>This dread &s;ort of cha&s;m in the acutene&s;s of
the feelings of Camilla la&s;ted not long; and Mrs.
Berlinton then brought from Melmond the fol|lowing
account.</P>
<P>With the utmo&s;t &s;peed he could u&s;e, he could
not, though a &s;ingle hor&s;e-man, overtake them.
They never, as he learnt by the way, remitted
their journey, nor &s;topt for the &s;malle&s;t refre&s;h|ment
but at &s;ome cottage. At length, in the la&s;t
<PB N="218" REF="45">
&s;tage to Gretna Green, he met them upon their
return. It was ea&s;y to him to &s;ee that his errand
was vain, and the knot indi&s;&s;olubly tied, by the
blinds being down, and the ea&s;y air with which
Bellamy was looking around him.</P>
<P>Eugenia &s;at back in the chai&s;e with a handker|chief
to her eyes. He &s;topt the vehicle, and told
Bellamy he mu&s;t &s;peak with that lady. &startq;That
lady, Sir,&endq; he produly an&s;wered, &startq;is my wife;
&s;peak to her, therefore;&mdash;but in my hearing.&endq;
Eugenia at this dropt her handkerchief, and looked
up. Her eyes were &s;unk into her head by weep|ing,
and her face was a living picture of grief.
Melmond loudly exclaimed: &startq;I come by the au|thority
of her friends, and I demand her own ac|count
of this tran&s;action.&endq; &startq;We are now going
to our friends,&endq; replied he, &startq;our&s;elves, and we
&s;hall &s;end them no me&s;&s;ages.&endq; He then ordered
the po&s;tillion to drive on, telling him at his peril
to &s;top no more; Eugenia, in a tone but ju&s;t audi|ble,
&s;aying: &startq;Adieu, Mr. Melmond! Adieu!&endq;</P>
<P>To have ri&s;ked his life in her re&s;cue, at &s;uch a
moment, &s;eemed to him nothing, could he but
more certainly have a&s;certained her own wi&s;hes,
and real &s;ituation: but as &s;he attempted neither re|&s;i&s;tance
nor remon&s;trance, he concluded Bellamy
&s;poke truth; and if they were married, he could
not unmarry them; and if they were going to her
friends, they were doing all he could now exact.
He re&s;olved, however, to follow, and if they &s;hould
$urn any other road, to call for a&s;&s;i&s;tance till he
could inve&s;tigate the truth.</P>
<P>They &s;topped occa&s;ionally for refre&s;hments at
the u&s;ual inns, and travelled no more in the dark;
but Bellamy never lo&s;t &s;ight of her; and Melmond,
in watching, ob&s;erved that &s;he returned to the
chai&s;e with as little oppo&s;ition as &s;he quitted it,
though weeping always, and never, for a voluntary
moment, uncovering her face. Bellamy &s;eemed
always mo&s;t a&s;&s;iduous in his attentions: &s;he never
<PB N="219" REF="46">
appeared to repul&s;e him, nor to receive from him any
comfort.</P>
<P>On the &s;econd day's journey, ju&s;t as Bellamy hand|ed
her from the chai&s;e, at the inn where they meant to
dine, and which Melmond, as u&s;ual, entered at the
&s;ame time, he &s;aw Mr. Tyrold&mdash;hurrying, but &s;o
&s;haking he could &s;carcely &s;upport him&s;elf, from a par|lour,
whence he had &s;een them alight, into the pa&s;|&s;age.
The eyes, ever downca&s;t, of Eugenia, per|ceived
him not, till &s;he was cla&s;ped, in mute agony,
in his arms. She then looked up, &s;aw who it was,
and fainted away. Bellamy, though he knew him
not, &s;uppo&s;ed who he might be, and his reverend ap|pearance
&s;eemed to impre&s;s him with awe. Never|thele&s;s,
be was him&s;elf &s;eizing the now &s;en&s;ele&s;s
Eugenia, to convey her to &s;ome room; when Mr.
Tyrold, reviving from indignation, fixed his eyes upon
his face, and &s;aid: &startq;By what authority, Sir, do
you pre&s;ume to take charge of my daughter?&endq;&mdash;&startq;By
the authority,&endq; he an&s;wered, &startq;of a hu&s;band.&endq; Mr.
Tyrold &s;aid no more; he caught by the arm of Mel|mond,
though he had not yet &s;een who he was, and
Bellamy carried Eugenia into the fir&s;t vacant parlour,
followed only by the woman of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Melmond then, re&s;pectfully, and filled with the
deepe&s;t commi&s;eration, &s;ought to make him&s;elf known
to Mr. Tyrold; but he heard him not, he heeded no
one; he &s;at down upon a trunk, accidentally, in the
pa&s;&s;age where all this had pa&s;&s;ed, &s;aying, but almo&s;t
without &s;eeming con&s;cious that he &s;poke aloud:
&startq;This, indeed, is a blow to break both our hearts!&endq;
Melmond then &s;tood &s;ilently by, for he &s;aw, by his
folded hands and uplifted eyes, he was ejaculating
&s;ome prayer: after which, with a countenance more
firm, and limbs better able to &s;u&s;tain him, he ro&s;e,
and moved towards the parlour into which the fainting
Eugenia had been carried.</P>
<P>Melmond then again &s;poke to him by his name.
He recollected the voice, turned to him, and gave
him his hand, which was of an icy coldne&s;s. &startq;You
are very kind, Mr. Melmond,&endq; he &s;aid; &startq;my poor
<PB N="220" REF="47">
girl&endq;&mdash;but &s;topt, checking what he meant to add,
and went to the parlour-door.</P>
<P>It was locked. The woman of the hou&s;e had
left it, and &s;aid, the lady was recovered from her
fit. Mr. Tyrold, from a thou&s;and feelings, &s;eem|ed
unable to demand admi&s;&s;ion for him&s;elf: he de|&s;ired
Melmond to &s;peak, and claim an audience
alone for him with his daughter.</P>
<P>Bellamy opened the door with a look evidently
humbled and frightened, yet affecting perfect ea&s;e.
When Melmond made known his commi&s;&s;ion,
Eugenia, &s;tarting up, exclaimed: &startq;Yes, yes! I
will &s;ee my dear Father alone!&mdash;and O! that this
poor frame might &s;ink to re&s;t on his loved bo&s;om!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;In a moment! in a moment!&endq; cried Bellamy,
motioning Melmond to withdraw; tell Mr. Ty|rold
he &s;hall come in a moment.&endq;</P>
<P>Melmond was forced to retreat; but heard him
ha&s;tily &s;ay, as again he fa&s;tened the door, &startq;My
life, O Eugenia! is in your hands&mdash;and is it thus
you requite my ardent love and con&s;tancy?&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold would now wait but a few minutes:
it was palpable Bellamy feared the interview; and
he could fear it but from one motive: he &s;ent
him, therefore, word by Melmond, that if he
did not immediately retire, and leave him to a
conference alone with his daughter, he would
apply no more for a meeting till he claimed it in a
court of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>Bellamy &s;oon came out, bowed ob&s;equiou&s;ly to
Mr. Tyrold, who pa&s;&s;ed him without notice, and
who was then for half an hour &s;hut up with Eu|genia.
Longer Bellamy could not endure; he
broke in upon them, and left the room no more.</P>
<P>Soon after, Mr. Tyrold came out, his own eyes
now as red as tho&s;e of the weeping bride. He
took Melmond apart, thanked him for his kind|ne&s;s,
but &s;aid nothing could be done. He entreat|ed
him therefore to return to his own happier af|fairs;
adding, &startq;I cannot talk upon this mi&s;erable
event. Tell Camilla, her &s;i&s;ter is, for the pre&s;ent,
<PB N="221" REF="48">
going home with me&mdash;though not, alas! alone!
Tell her, too, I will write to her upon my arrival
at Etherington.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This,&endq; concluded Mrs. Berlinton, &startq;is all my
brother has to relate; all that for him&s;elf he adds&punc;
is, that if ever, to &s;omething human, the mind of
an angel was accorded&mdash;that mind &s;eems en&s;hrined
in the heart of Eugenia!&endq;</P>
<P>Nothing that Camilla had yet experienced o$
unhappine&s;s, had penetrated her with feelings of
&s;uch deadly woe as this event. Eugenia, from her
childhood, had &s;eemed marked by calamity: her
ill health, even from infancy, and her &s;ub&s;equent
misfortunes, had excited in her whole hou&s;e the
tendere&s;t pity, to which the uncommon character
with which &s;he grew up, had added re&s;pect and
admiration. And the &s;trange, and almo&s;t continu|al
trials &s;he had to encounter, from the period of
her attaining her fifteenth year, which, far from
&s;ouring her mind, had &s;eemed to render it more
perfect, had now nearly &s;anctified her in the e&s;tima|tion
of them all. To &s;ee her, therefore, fall, at
la&s;t, a &s;acrifice to deceit or violence,&mdash;for one, if
not both, had palpably put her into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of Bellamy, was a grief more piercingly wounding
than all &s;he had yet &s;uffered. Whatever &s;he had
per&s;onally to bear, &s;he con&s;tantly imagined &s;ome
imprudence or impropriety had provoked; but
Eugenia, while &s;he appeared to her &s;o blamele&s;s,
that &s;he could merit no evil, was &s;o amiable, that
willingly &s;he would have borne for her their united
portions.</P>
<P>How it had been effected, &s;ince force would be
illegal, &s;till kept amazement joined to &s;orrow, till
the promi&s;ed letter arrived from Mr. Tyrold, with
an account of the tran&s;action.</P>
<P>Eugenia, parted from Mi&s;s Margland by Bellamy,
in the crowd, was obliged to accept his his pro|tection,
which, till then, &s;he had refu&s;ed, to re&s;tore
her to her company. The coach, he &s;aid, he
knew, had orders to wait in Pall Mall, whither
<PB N="222" REF="49">
the other ladies would be conveyed in chairs, to
avoid danger from the &s;urrounding carriages. She
de&s;ired to go, al&s;o, in a chair; but he hurried her
by quick &s;urprize into a hackney-coach, which, he
&s;aid, would be more &s;peedy, and bidding the man
drive to Pall Mall &s;eated him&s;elf oppo&s;ite to her.
She had not the mo&s;t remote &s;u&s;picion of his de&s;ign,
as his behaviour was even coldly di&s;tant, though
&s;he wondered Pall Mall was &s;o far off, and that
the coachman drove &s;o fa&s;t, till they &s;topt at a
turnpike&mdash;and then, in one quick and decided
moment, &s;he comprehended her &s;ituation, and
made an attempt for her own deliverance&mdash;but he
prevented her from being heard.&mdash;And the &s;cenes
that followed &s;he declined relating. Yet, what
&s;he would not recount, &s;he could not, to the que&s;|tions
of her Father, deny, that force, from that
moment, was u&s;ed, to repel all her efforts for ob|taining
help, and to remove her into a chai&s;e.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold required to hear nothing more, to
e&s;tabli&s;h a pro&s;ecution, and to &s;eize her, publickly,
from Bellamy. But from this &s;he recoiled. &startq;No,
my dear Father,&endq; &s;he continued, &startq;the die is ca&s;t!
and I am his!&mdash;Solemn has been my vow! &s;acred
I mu&s;t hold it!&endq;</P>
<P>She then briefly narrated, that though violence
was u&s;ed to &s;ilence her at every place where &s;he
&s;ought to be re&s;cued, every interval was employed,
by Bellamy, in the humble&s;t &s;upplications for her
pardon, and mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate prote&s;tations of re|gard,
all beginning and all ending in declaring,
that to live longer without her was impo&s;&s;i ble,
and pledging his ardent attachment for obtaining
her future favour; &s;pending the period from &s;tage
to &s;tage, or turnpike to urnpike, in kneeling to
be&s;eech forgivene&s;s for the de&s;peration to which
he was driven, by the mo&s;t cruel and hopele&s;s
pa&s;&s;ion that ever &s;eized the heart of man. When
they were near their journey's end, he owned that
his life was in her hands, but he was indifferent
whether he lo&s;t it from the mi&s;ery of living with|out
<PB N="223" REF="50">
her, or from her vengeance of this la&s;t &s;trug|gle
of his de&s;pair. She a&s;&s;ured him his life was
&s;afe, and offered him pardon upon condition of
immediate re&s;toration to her friends; but, &s;udden|ly
producing a pi&s;tol, &startq;Now then,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;O!
amiable object of my con&s;tant love! ble&s;s me with
your hand, or prepare to &s;ee me die at your feet!&endq;
And, with a terrifying oath, he bound him&s;elf not
to lo&s;e her and outlive her lo&s;s. She be&s;ought him
to be more rea&s;onable, with the gentle&s;t prayers;
but his vehemence only encrea&s;ed; &s;he offered
him every other promi&s;e he could name; but he
preferred death to every other &s;he &s;hould grant.
She then pronounced, though in trembling, a po&s;i|tive
refu&s;al. In&s;tantly he lifted up his pi&s;tol, and
calling out: &startq;Forgive, then, O hard-hearted
Eugenia, my uncontroulable pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;hed a
tear over the corp&s;e I am going to pro&s;trate at your
feet!&endq; was pointing it to his temple, when over|come
with horror, &s;he caught his arm, exclaim|ing;
&startq;Ah! &s;top! I con&s;ent to what you plea&s;e!&endq;
It was in vain &s;he &s;trove afterwards to retract;
one &s;cene followed another, till he had bound her
by all &s;he her&s;elf held &s;acred, to re&s;cue him from
&s;uicide, by con&s;enting to the union. He found a
per&s;on who performed the marriage ceremony on
the minute of her quitting the chai&s;e. She utter|ed
not one word; &s;he was pa&s;&s;ive, &s;cared, and
&s;carce alive; but re&s;i&s;ted not the eventful ring,
with which he encircled her finger, and &s;eemed
rou&s;ing as from a dream&punc; upon hearing him call
her his wife. He profe&s;&s;ed eternal gratitude, and
eternal devotion; but no &s;ooner was all conflict
at an end, than, con&s;igning her&s;elf wholly to grief,
&s;he wept without intermi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>When Mr. Tyrold had heard her hi&s;tory, abhor|rence
of &s;uch barbarous force, and dete&s;tation of
&s;uch foul play upon the ingenuous credulity of
her nature, made him in&s;i&s;t, yet more &s;trongly,
upon taking legal mea&s;ures for procuring an im|mediate
&s;eparation and &s;ub&s;equent puni&s;hment; but
<PB N="224" REF="51">
the reiterated vows with which, &s;ince the ceremo|ny,
he had bound her to him&s;elf, &s;o forcibly awed
the &s;trict con&s;cientiou&s;ne&s;s of her principles,
that no repre&s;entations could ab&s;olve her opinion
of what &s;he now held her duty; and while &s;he
confe&s;&s;ed her unhappine&s;s at a connexion formed
by &s;uch cruel means, &s;he conjured him not to en|crea&s;e
it, by rendering her, in her own e&s;timati|on,
perjured.</P>
<P>&startq;Patiently, therefore,&endq; continued Mr. Tyrold,
&startq;we mu&s;t bear, what vainly we &s;hould combat,
and bow down to tho&s;e calamities of which the
purpo&s;e is hidden, nor fancy no good is an&s;wered,
becau&s;e none is obvious. Man develops but little,
though he experiences much. The time will come
for his greater diffu&s;ion of knowledge; let him
meet it without dread, by u&s;ing worthily his actual
portion. I re&s;ign my&s;elf, therefore, with reve|rence
to this blow; though none yet has &s;truck
&s;o hardly at my heart. We mu&s;t now do what we
can for this victim to her own purity, by &s;eeking
means to &s;ecure her future independence, and by
bettering&mdash;if po&s;&s;ible!&mdash;her betrayer. What a
daughter, what a &s;i&s;ter, what a friend, has her fa|mily

&s;uch killing tidings! Misfortune, &s;ickne&s;s,
and poverty, &s;he has heroi&s;m to endure; but in|nocence
oppre&s;&s;ed through its own artle&s;&s;ne&s;s, and
inexperience duped by villainy, will &s;hake her ut|mo&s;t

&mdash;no evils that vi&s;ited the early years of this loved

my Camilla, at the deprivation you &s;u&s;tain|ed
at that period.&mdash;We owe to it, perhaps, that
you have not as treacherou&s;ly been betrayed!</P>
<P>&startq;How has the opening promi&s;e of our Eugenia
more than an&s;wered our fonde&s;t expectations!
Her knowledge is &s;till le&s;s is uncommon than her
&s;implicity, her philo&s;ophy for her&s;elf than her

<P>A letter from Lavinia contained &s;ome further
particulars. Their Father, &s;he &s;aid, finding the
poor victim re&s;olute, meant to &s;pare Sir Hugh all
that was po&s;&s;ible of the dete&s;table craft of Bellamy;
and Eugenia was already &s;truggling to recover her
natural &s;erenity, that &s;he might appear before him
without endangering his own. Bellamy talked of
nothing but love and rapture; yet the un&s;u&s;picious
Eugenia was the only per&s;on he deceived; for &s;o
little from the heart &s;eemed either his looks or his
expre&s;&s;ions, that it was palpable he was acting a
part, to all who believed it po&s;&s;ible words and

her time in their perpetual peru&s;al, in wiping from

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Progre&s;s of Di&s;&s;ipation.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Clykes, by the promi&s;ed payment and re|ward,
being for the pre&s;ent appea&s;ed, Camilla &s;till
admitted &s;ome hope of waiting a more favourable
moment for her cruel confe&s;&s;ion. She received,
al&s;o, a little though mournful, reprieve from ter|ror,
by a letter from Li&s;bon, written to again
po&s;tpone the return of Mrs. Tyrold, at the earne&s;t
reque&s;t of Mr. Relvil; and &s;he flattered her&s;elf
that, before her arrival, &s;he &s;hould be enabled to
re&s;ume tho&s;e only duties which could draw her
from de&s;pondence. She lived, meanwhile, wholly
&s;hut up from all company, con&s;igned to penitence
for her indi&s;cretions, to grief for the fate of her
&s;i&s;ter, and to wa&s;ting regret of her own cau&s;ele&s;sly
lo&s;t felicity.</P>
<P>Indiana &s;miled not more &s;weetly upon Mel|mond,
for Mi&s;s Margland's advi&s;ing her to con|&s;ider
in time, whether the promi&s;es made by Mi&s;s
Eugenia Tyrold, would be binding to Mrs. Bel|lamy.
She &s;aw, neverthele&s;s, no good, &s;he &s;aid, it
could do her cou&s;in, that &s;he &s;hould neglect &s;uch
an opportunity of &s;eeing London: and Mi&s;s
Margland, in aid of this de&s;ire, &s;pared &s;o much
trouble to Mrs. Berlinton, who &s;oon wearied of
Indiana, that &s;he had the &s;atisfaction of being in|vited
to remain in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare till the two
young ladies returned into the country.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who indulged, in full ex|tent,
every feeling, but inve&s;tigated none, had
been piqued and hurt to extreme unhappine&s;s at the
late conduct of Bellamy. Attracted by his fine
per&s;on, and caught by the fir&s;t flattery which had
talked to her of her own, &s;he had ea&s;ily been cap|tivated
by his de&s;cription of the &s;ympathy which
united, and penetrated by his lamentations at the
<PB N="227" REF="54">
de&s;tiny which parted them. His reque&s;t for her
friend&s;hip had been the fir&s;t circum&s;tance, after
her marriage, which had given her any intere&s;t in
life; and &s;oon, with the common effect of &s;uch
dangerous expedients to while away chagrin, had
occupied all her thoughts, and made the re&s;t of
the univer&s;e &s;eem to her as a blank. But their
continued &s;eparation from each other, made the
day &s;oon too long for mere regret; and her pliant
mind, in this &s;tate of vacancy, had readily been
bent to the new pur&s;uit pre&s;&s;ed upon her by Mrs.
Norfield; which, however, upon the re-appear|ance
of Bellamy, would &s;peedily have given way
to the re&s;umption of his influence, had not his
elopement with Eugenia left her again all at large.
It de&s;troyed an illu&s;ion &s;trong though not defina|ble;
demoli&s;hed a friend&s;hip ill conceived, and
wor&s;e under&s;tood; and brought with it a di&s;ap|pointment
which confu&s;ed all her ideas. To be
inactive was, however, impo&s;&s;ible; &s;implicity,
once given up, returns to the di&s;&s;ipated no more
or returns but when experience brings conviction,
That all is hollow where the heart bears no part;
all is peril where principle is not the guide.</P>
<P>The Faro Table was now re-opened, and again
but too powerfully &s;harpened the faculties which
mortification had blunted. A company the mo&s;t
mi&s;cellaneous compo&s;ed her evening a&s;&s;emblies,
which were &s;oon, neverthele&s;s, among&s;t the mo&s;t
fa&s;hionable, as well as crowded of the metropolis.
Whatever there, is new and &s;plendid, is &s;ure of a
run for at lea&s;t a &s;ea&s;on. Enquiries into what is
right, or &s;trictures upon what is wrong, rarely
mole&s;t popularity, till the ri&s;e of &s;ome fre&s;her lu|minary
gives fa&s;hion another abode.</P>
<P>Calamity requires not more fortitude than plea|&s;ure.
What &s;he began but to divert di&s;appoint|ment
and la&s;&s;itude, &s;he continued to attain cele|brity;
and the company which Faro and Fa&s;hion
brought together, &s;he &s;oon grew ambitious to
collect by motives of more appropriate flattery.
<PB N="228" REF="55">
All her aim, now, was to be univer&s;ally alluring;
and &s;he looked from object to object, in &s;miling
di&s;cour&s;e, till one by one, every object could look
only at her: and the grace and &s;oftne&s;s which had
been &s;ecretly bewitching while &s;he had the dignity
to keep admiration aloof, were boldly declared to
be invincible, &s;ince &s;he permitted &s;uch profe&s;&s;ions
to reach her ear.</P>
<P>Long &s;urrounded by gazing admirers, &s;he be|came
now encircled by avowed adorers; and what
for victory &s;he had e&s;&s;ayed, &s;he pur&s;ued ardently
for plea&s;ure. Coquetry is as fa&s;cinating to tho&s;e
who practi&s;e it, as to tho&s;e whom it &s;educes; and
&s;he found her&s;elf, &s;hortly more happy by a con|que&s;t
effected by wiles and by art, than by any
devotion paid &s;traight forward, and uncourted.
The generality of her new ambition protected it
from permanent ill con&s;equences; aiming at every
one, &s;he cared for no one; mortified by Bellamy,
&s;he re&s;olved to mortify others, and in proportion
as her &s;miles grew &s;ofter her heart became harder.</P>
<P>Indiana, at this period, immer&s;ed at once from
the mo&s;t private retreat into the gaye&s;t vortex of
plea&s;ure, thought her&s;elf in the upper regions,
where happine&s;s, compo&s;ed by her own ideas, con|&s;i&s;ted
in perpetual admiration of unfading beauty:
but though the high qualities with which the de|votion
of Melmond had gifted her, had en&s;laved
his rea&s;on and under&s;tanding from &s;u&s;pecting that
&s;o $air a form could enclo&s;e aught &s;hort of its own
perfection, his heart was &s;truck and all his feelings
were offended, when he &s;aw her capable of di&s;&s;ipa|tion
upon a &s;ea&s;on of calamity to Eugenia: Euge|nia,
whom though he could not love, he venerated;
Eugenia, who&s;e nature he thought divine, though
her per&s;on, unhappily, was but too human; Eu|genia,
to whom he owed the union upon which
hung all his wi&s;hes &hellip; to &s;eek plea&s;ure while
Eugenia &s;uffered, was a&s;toni&s;hing, was incompre|hen&s;ible.
He felt as if every principle of his love
were violated; he looked another way, to di&s;gui&s;e
<PB N="229" REF="56">
his &s;hock;&mdash;but when he looked at her again, it
was forgotten.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;oon after learnt, from Lavinia, that
Sir Hugh had been deeply affected by the hi&s;tory
of the elopement, though it had been &s;oftened to
him by all po&s;&s;ible means, at the de&s;ire of the
heroic Eugenia her&s;elf; who would now own to
no one the force with which &s;he had been carried
off. Bellamy continued the mo&s;t unremitting de|mon&s;trations
of affection, which &s;he received with
gentlene&s;s, and appeared entirely to credit as
&s;incere; but he had already ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed a
re&s;idence offered for them both at Cleves, and
made Eugenia her&s;elf a&s;k a &s;eparate provi&s;ion of
her uncle, though &s;he could not even a moment
pretend that the de&s;ire was her own. Sir Hugh,
neverthele&s;s, had yielded; and notwith&s;tanding
his pre&s;ent embarra&s;&s;ments from Clermont, had
in&s;i&s;ted upon &s;ettling a thou&s;and pounds a year
upon her immediately; in con&s;equence of which,
Bellamy had in&s;tantly taken a hou&s;e at Belfont, to
which they were already removing. Eugenia had
recovered her gentle fortitude, &s;eemed to &s;ubmit
to her de&s;tiny, and repined &s;olely &s;he could not,
yet, keep her engagement with re&s;pect to the
trinkets, which though &s;he had openly told Bella|my
were promi&s;ed to a friend, he had &s;eized to
pack up, and &s;aid, &startq;he could not re-deliver till
they were arranged in their new dwelling.&endq; But
&s;he charged Lavinia to expre&s;s her hopes that the
detention would not la&s;t long.</P>
<P>When the given three weeks expired, Indiana,
infatuated with London, begged and obtained leave
to &s;tretch her re&s;idence there to a month.</P>
<P>Eugenia was now &s;ettled at Belfont; but &s;till
Camilla received no intelligence of the promi&s;ed
boon, and &s;pent her lingering hours in her cham|ber,
<PB N="230" REF="57">
no longer even invited thence, except at
meals, by Mrs. Berlinton; who&s;e extreme and en|crea&s;ing
di&s;&s;ipation, from fir&s;t allowing no time,
took off, next, all de&s;ire for &s;ocial life. Surpri&s;ed
and hurt, Camilla was called off a little from her|&s;elf,
through concern. She &s;incerely loved Mrs.
Berlinton, whom it was difficult to &s;ee and know
with indifference, and &s;he &s;oftly repre&s;ented to her
how ill &s;he felt at ea&s;e in the falling off &s;he expe|rienced
in her partiality.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton tenderly embraced her, prote&s;t|ing
&s;he was dear to her as ever; and feeling, while
&s;he &s;poke, her fir&s;t affection return; but not a
moment had &s;he to be&s;tow from her new mode of
life: &s;ome party was always formed which &s;he had
not force of mind to break: an internal re&s;tle&s;s|ne&s;s,
from the want of &s;ome right pur&s;uit, joined
to a di&s;appointment &s;he could not own, made that
party induce another; and though none gave her
real plea&s;ure, which her &s;trong, however undi&s;ci|plined
and unguided feelings, &s;hut out from &s;uch
&s;uch a &s;pecies of vague life, all gave employment
to expectation, and were preferable to a regret at
once con&s;uming and mortifying.</P>
<P>Her gentlene&s;s, h$wever, and her returned
per&s;onal kindne&s;s, encouraged Camilla to repeat
her admonitions, and engage a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Mel|mond;
who, at any other period, would, uncalled,
have given his whole attention to a &s;i&s;ter dear at
once to his honour and his heart; but Indiana
more than occupied, &s;he engro&s;&s;ed him. She now
expected an adoration &s;o unremitting, that if &s;he
&s;urpri&s;ed his eyes turned any other way even a
moment, &s;he reproached him with abated love,
and it was the bu&s;ine&s;s of a day to obtain a re|conciliation.</P>
<P>Gratefully, however, at the in&s;tigation of Ca|milla,
he re&s;umed the vigilance with which, upon
her fir&s;t entering London the preceding year, he
had attended to all the actions of his &s;i&s;ter. But
the difference already produced by the effect of
<PB N="231" REF="58">
flattery, the hardening of example, and the &s;way
of uncontrolled early power, a&s;toni&s;hed and alarm|ed
him. At her fir&s;t &s;etting out, &s;he had hearken|ed
to all coun&s;el, frightened by every repre&s;enta|tion
of danger, and humbled by every remon&s;trance
again&s;t impropriety. But &s;he now heard him with
little or no emotion; and from beginning to
li&s;ten unmoved, &s;oon proceeded to reply and re|&s;i&s;t.
A &s;earch, rather than a love, of plea&s;ure
had &s;eized her young mind, which had now gained
an a&s;cendant that rendered conte&s;t le&s;s &s;hocking,
than yielding would have been painful.</P>
<P>The tribulation of Melmond at this ill &s;ucce&s;s,
re&s;ted not &s;olely upon his &s;i&s;ter; he &s;aw yet more
danger for Indiana, who now &s;eemed &s;carce to
live but while arraying, or di&s;playing her&s;elf.
His pa&s;&s;ion had lo&s;t its novelty, and her eyes lo&s;t
their beaming plea&s;ure in li&s;tening to it; and the
regard he had fondly expected to take place of fir&s;t
extacy, he now found unattainable, from want of
all materials for its &s;tructure. His di&s;cour&s;e, when
not of her beauty, but &s;trained her faculties; his
reading, when compelled to hear it, but wearied
her intellects. She had no genius to catch his
meaning, and no attention to &s;upply its place.</P>
<P>Deeply he now thought of Eugenia, with that
regret ever attached to frail humanity, for what is
removed from po&s;&s;ible po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion. The purity of
her love, the cultivation of her mind, and the
noblene&s;s of her &s;entiments, now bore forth a
contra&s;t to the general mental and intellectual lit|tlene&s;s
of Indiana, which made him blame the
fa&s;tidious eyes, that could dwell upon her face and
form; and feel that, even with the matchle&s;s In|diana,
he mu&s;t &s;igh at their mutual perver&s;ity of
fate.</P>
<P>Nor mi&s;&s;ed he more in &s;oul, than Indiana in
adoration, who turned from what &s;he now re&s;ented
as coldne&s;s, to the violent prai&s;es of Macder&s;ey,
who became, at this period, a frequenter of Mrs.
Berlinton's a&s;&s;emblies. She under&s;tood not the
<PB N="232" REF="59">
inevitable difference of the altered &s;ituation; that
he who was accepted might be grateful, but could
not be anxious; and that Melmond, while in &s;u&s;|pen&s;e,
wore the &s;ame impa&s;&s;ioned air, and &s;poke
the &s;ame impa&s;&s;ioned feelings as Macder&s;ey. To
her, all &s;eemed the change not from doubt to &s;ecu|rity,
but from love to in&s;en&s;ibility.</P>
<P>To live always at her feet, while he thought
her all-divine, was his own fir&s;t joy and greate&s;t
pride: but when once he found his godde&s;s had
every mortal imperfection, his homage cea&s;ed,
with amazement that ever it could have been ex|cited.
Tho&s;e eyes, thought he, which I have
gazed at whole days with &s;uch unreflecting admi|ration;
and who&s;e &s;hape, colour, &s;ize, and &s;weet
proportion &s;till hold their pre-eminence, now,
while retaining their fir&s;t lu&s;tre, have lo&s;t all their
illu&s;ory charm! I meet them&mdash;but to deplore their
vacancy of the &s;oul's intelligence&mdash;I fondly&mdash;vainly
&s;eek!&endq;</P>
<P>Even when again the time arrived for returning
to Cleves, Indiana, hanging languidly upon every
minute &s;he could &s;teal from it, petitioned for a few
days more from the ever-granting Baronet, which,
while by her devoted to coquetry, admiration,
and dre&s;s, were con&s;umed by Camilla in almo&s;t
every &s;pecies of wretchedne&s;s. Mrs. Mittin wrote
her word that Mr. Clykes was become more unea&s;y
than ever for his money, as &s;he had thought it
indi&s;pen&s;able to acquaint him of the reports in the
neighbourhood, that Mr. Tyrold had met with
misfortunes, and was retrenching: if he could not,
therefore, be paid quickly, he mu&s;t put in his
claims el&s;ewhere.</P>
<P>The &s;ame po&s;t brought from Lavinia an account
&s;o afflicting of Eugenia, as nearly to annihilate even
this deep per&s;onal di&s;tre&s;s. It was known, through
Molly Mill, who, by the expre&s;s in&s;i&s;tance of
Sir Hugh, continued to live with her young
<PB N="233" REF="60">
Mi&s;tre&s;s, that Bellamy had already, at Belfont,
ca&s;t off the ma&s;k of pretended pa&s;&s;ion, and gro&s;sly
demanded of her Mi&s;tre&s;s to beg money for him of
Sir Hugh; acknowledging without &s;cruple, large
debts, that demanded &s;peedy payment, and pre&s;&s;ing
her to a&s;k for the immediate po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the
York&s;hire e&s;tate. Her Mi&s;tre&s;s though mildly,
always &s;teadily refu&s;ed; which occa&s;ioned re|proaches
&s;o rude and violent as almo&s;t to frighten
her into fits; and &s;o loud that they were often
heard by every &s;ervant in the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Camilla, at this dreadful hi&s;tory, grew nearly
indifferent to all el&s;e, and would have relinqui&s;hed,
almo&s;t unrepining, her expectations of per&s;onal
relief, but that Lavinia, in the name of their un|happy
&s;i&s;ter, bid her &s;till cheri&s;h them; a&s;&s;uring
her &s;he hoped yet to perform her engagement, as
Mr. Bellamy never di&s;puted her already given
promi&s;e, though he had mi&s;laid the key of the box
in which the trinkets were depo&s;ited.</P>
<P>Nor even here re&s;ted the mi&s;ery of Camilla:
another alarm &s;tole upon her mind, of a nature
the mo&s;t dreadful.</P>
<P>Upon the fir&s;t evening of this newly-granted
&s;tay, while &s;he was conver&s;ing alone with Mrs.
Berlinton before the nocturnal <HI>toilette</HI> of that lady,
a &s;ervant announced Mr. Bellamy. Mrs. Berlinton
blu&s;hed high, evidently with as much of anger as
&s;urpri&s;e; Camilla ha&s;tily withdrawing, to avoid
an object abhorrent to her, wondered &s;he would ad|mit
him: yet, anxious for any intelligence that could
relate to her &s;i&s;ter, enquired when he was gone,
and ran towards the dre&s;&s;ing-room to a&s;k what had
pa&s;&s;ed: but before &s;he reached the door, the &s;ound
of his voice re-entering the hall, and of his &s;tep
re-a&s;cending the &s;tairs, made her fly into the ad|joining
apartment, not to encounter him; where
the in&s;tant he had &s;hut the door, and before &s;he
could move, &s;he heard him exclaim, &startq;You weep
&s;till, my lovely friend? Ah! can one doubt &s;o
injurious remain upon your mind, as to &s;uppo&s;e
<PB N="234" REF="61">
any thing but the cruel nece&s;&s;ity of my misfortunes
could have made me tarni&s;h our cele&s;tial friend&s;hip
with any other engagement? Ah! look at her.&hellip;
and look at your&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who, at fir&s;t, had been immoveable from
con&s;ternation, now recovered &s;ufficiently to get back
to her room. But &s;he returned no more to Mrs. Ber|linton,
though Bellamy &s;oon departed; her eagerne&s;s
for information &s;ub&s;ided in indignant &s;orrow. That
Eugenia, the injured, the ine&s;timable Eugenia, &s;hould
be &s;poken of, by the very violator who had torn her
from her friends, as a mere burthen attached to the
wealth &s;he procured him, &s;truck at her heart as a
poignard. And the impropriety to her&s;elf, and the
wrong to Eugenia, of Mrs. Berlinton, in li&s;tening to
&s;uch a di&s;cour&s;e, totally &s;unk that lady in her e&s;teem;
though it determined her, as a duty due to them all
around, to repre&s;ent what &s;he felt upon this &s;ubject:
and the next day, the in&s;tant &s;he was vi&s;ible, &s;he
begged an audience.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton was pen&s;ive and dejected, but, as
u&s;ual, open and unguarded: &s;he began her&s;elf to &s;peak
of the vi&s;it of Bellamy, and to a&s;k why &s;he ran away.</P>
<P>Camilla, without an&s;wer or he&s;itation, related what
&s;he had overhe$rd, adding, &startq;O, Mrs. Berlinton!
can you &s;uffer him to talk thus? Can you think of my
injured Eugenia&mdash;lately your own favourite friend&mdash;
and bear to hear him?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How injured, my ever-dear Camilla? Doe$ &s;he
know what he &s;ays? Can it hurt her unheard? Can
it affect her unimagined? He but &s;olaces his &s;adne&s;s
by a confidence he holds &s;acred; 'tis the type of our
friend&s;hip, now dearer, he &s;ays, than ever, &s;ince re|ciprocated
by &s;uch &s;ympathy.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You affright me, Mrs. Berlinton! what a p$r|ver&s;ion
of rea&s;on to talk of &s;ympathy in your &s;itu|ations?
Did Eugenia pre&s;s him to the altar? Did any
friends &s;olicit the alliance? Oh, Mrs. Berlinton! think
but a moment, and your own feeling mind will paint
his conduct in colours I have not the &s;kill to attain!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="235" REF="62">
&startq;You are right!&endq; cried &s;he, blu&s;hing in her un|willing
conviction: &startq;I know not how he could de|lude
me to believe our fates re&s;embled. Certainly
nothing can be le&s;s &s;imilar.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was happy in this victory; but the follow|ing
day, Bellamy, at the &s;ame hour was announced,
and in the &s;ame manner was admitted; Camilla flying,
and Mrs. Berlinton prote&s;ting &s;he &s;hould attack his
mi&s;taken compari&s;on with &s;everity.</P>
<P>Severity, however, was a quality with which &s;he
was unacquainted; Camilla, anxious in every way,
ha&s;tened to her when he was gone, but found her di&s;|&s;olved
in tender tears, &s;hed, &s;he declared, in regret of
the unea&s;ine&s;s &s;he had given him, for he had now made
her fully &s;en&s;ible his de&s;tiny alone was to blame.</P>
<P>The under&s;tanding of Camilla was highly &s;uperior
to being duped by &s;uch $lim&s;y &s;ophi&s;try, which &s;he
heard with added dete&s;tation of the character of Bel|lamy;
yet perceived that no remon&s;trance could pre|vent
his admittance, and that every interview regular|ly
de&s;troyed the effect of every exhortation.</P>
<P>In this melancholy period, the &s;ole &s;atisfaction &s;he
received was through a letter written by Lionel from
O&s;tend, in which he told that the dread of impri&s;on|ment,
or want, in a foreign country, made him lead
a life &s;o par&s;imonious, &s;o totally deprived of all plea|&s;ure
and all comfort, that he was almo&s;t con&s;umed
with regret for the wilfulne&s;s with which he had
thrown away his innumerable advantages; and &s;o much
&s;truck with the retro&s;pection of the wanton follies and
vices which had involved him in &s;uch di&s;honour and
ruin, that he began now to think he had rather been
mad than wicked;&mdash;&s;o unmeaning, unreflecting, and
unprovoked, as well as worthle&s;s, had been the cour&s;e
he had pur&s;ued.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;ent this letter immediately to her Father,
who remitted to Lionel &s;uch a &s;um as mu&s;t obviate
di&s;$re&s;s, with &s;uch intimation for the future as he
hoped would be&s;t encourage more &s;olid reformation.</P>
<P>Thus pa&s;&s;ed the time, improperly, or unhappily to
all, till the third period fixed for the return to the
<PB N="236" REF="63">
country elap&s;ed; and Camilla, finding the whole view
of her journey abortive, &s;aw the accumulated yet u&s;e|le&s;s
&s;uffering involved through her ill-judged procra&s;|tination.
Yet, as Eugenia &s;till did not de&s;pair, even
her confe&s;&s;ion was unwritten; and as Mi&s;s Margland
and Indiana granted her reque&s;t of going round by
Belfont, which &s;he had previou&s;ly arranged from an
ardent de&s;ire to embrace her loved &s;i&s;ter, &s;he &s;till dwelt
on a la&s;t hope from that interview.</P>

<P>WITH mingled di&s;quietude and di&s;ta&s;te, Melmond
&s;aw the reluctance of Indiana to quit town, and that
he was le&s;s than a cypher with her upon the la&s;t
evening's a&s;&s;embly, where, without deigning to be|&s;tow
one look upon him, &s;he chatted, &s;miled, and flut|tered
with every one el&s;e; undi&s;gui&s;edly betraying, that
he whom &s;he &s;hould &s;oon have alone, and have always,
&s;hould not rob of even one precious moment this la&s;t
&s;plendid blaze of general admiration. He &s;ighed; and
in common with the haple&s;s perver&s;ene&s;s of mor|ta$s,
thought he had <HI>thrown away,</HI> in Eugenia, <HI>a gem
richer than all her tribe!</HI><NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Shake&s;peare.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Camilla, who&s;e heart, however dead to joy, was
invariably open to tenderne&s;s, was melted wi$h fond
emotions in the idea of again meeting her beloved Eu|genia,
and ready for her journey nearly with the
light.</P>
<P>Soo$ after &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed, a hou&s;e maid, tapping
at her door, &s;aid, &startq;Pray, Ma'am, is Mi&s;s Lynmere
with you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No.&endq;</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently Mi&s;s Margland came her&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="237" REF="64">
&startq;Pray, Mi&s;s Camilla, do you know any thing of
Mi&s;s Lynmere? It's the odde&s;t thing in the world
where &s;he can be?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, now, went forth to aid the &s;earch; Mel|mond,
who was waiting to hand her into the carriage,
looked amazed at the enquiry. It $oon, however, was
clear, that &s;he was no where in the hou&s;e; and, after
&s;undry examinations and re&s;earches, one of the maids
was brought to confe&s;s having aided her, in the mid|dle
of the night, to go into the &s;treet, where &s;he was
handed into a po&s;t chai&s;e by Mr. Macder&s;ey.</P>
<P>Melmond appeared thunder &s;truck. An action &s;o
unexpected at the period of a &s;olemn engagement
which waited but the journey to Cleves for being
completed, &s;eemed to him, at fir&s;t, incredible. But,
when Mi&s;s Margland exclaimed, &startq;O pur&s;ue her, Mr.
Melmond! order your hor&s;e, and gallop to Scotland
Immediately!&endq; he gravely, and rather drily an&s;wered:
&startq;By no means, Ma'am! The man who has the ho|nour
of her preference, is the only one who can have
any hope to make her happy. I have no ambition for
a hand that has been voluntarily held out to another.&endq;</P>
<P>He then returned, quietly, to his own lodgings;
far more indignant than hurt at this abrupt conclu&s;ion
of a connexion which, though it had opened to him
as a promi&s;e of Ely&s;ium, was clo&s;ing with every me|nace
of mutual di&s;content.</P>
<P>Camilla was truly concerned; and not merely for
the future ri&s;k run by her Cou&s;in, in this ra&s;h flight,
but for the new di&s;appointment to her Uncle. She
was obliged, however, to be&s;tow her whole attention
upon Mi&s;s Margland, who&s;e tribulation was yet great|er,
and who, in lo&s;ing thus her pupil, lo&s;t the expect|ed
reward of near thirteen years of unwilling attend|ance.
She had, by no means, indeed, merited this
treachery from Indiana, whom though incapable to
in&s;truct in much good, &s;he had &s;edulou&s;ly guarded from
all evil.</P>
<P>To return to Sir Hugh without her charge, with|out
indeed either of the young ladies who were put
under her care, &s;he had not courage. Nor could Ca|milla
&s;o little feel for her di&s;tre&s;s as to reque&s;t it.
<PB N="238" REF="65">
An expre&s;s, therefore, was ordered to Cleves, for
informing him of tho&s;e ill tidings, with a very elabo|rate
panegyric from Mi&s;s Margland of her own con|duct;
and a de&s;ire to know if &s;he &s;hould remain in
town till &s;omething tran&s;pired concerning Indiana.</P>
<P>The expre&s;s was but ju&s;t gone, when a packet,
which ought to have arrived two days before, by the
&s;tage, was delivered to Camilla. Its intention was
merely to convey more &s;peedily a letter from Lavi|nia,
containing the terrible information that Mr. Clykes
had ju&s;t been at Etherington him&s;elf, to deliver in
his accounts, and pre&s;s immediate payment; their Fa|ther,
Lavinia &s;aid, conceived the whole &s;ome impo&s;i|tion,
till the man produced the paper &s;igned by his
daughter. She had then been called in, and obliged
to confe&s;s her knowledge of the tran&s;action. She
would avoid, &s;he &s;aid, particulars that could be only
u&s;ele&s;sly afflicting; but the interview had ended in
their Father's agreeing to pay, when it &s;hould be po&s;|&s;ible,
the &s;ums actually delivered to the creditors, and
for which Mr. Clykes could produce their own re|ceipts;
but refu&s;ing, po&s;itively and ab&s;olutely, any
gratuity what&s;oever, from dete&s;tation of &s;o dangerous
and &s;eductive a &s;pecies of trade, as clande&s;tine and il|legal
money-lending to minors. The man, much pro|voked,
&s;aid a friend of his had been u&s;ed far more
hand&s;omely by Sir Hugh Tyrold; but finding his re|mon&s;trances
vain, acknowledged the law again&s;t him
for the intere&s;t; but threatened to &s;end in an account
for his own trouble, in collecting and paying the bills,
that he would di&s;pute, for validity, in any court of
ju&s;tice to which he could be &s;ummoned: and, in leav|ing
the hou&s;e, he menaced an immediate writ, if all
he could legally claim were not paid the next day;
unle&s;s a new bond were properly &s;igned, with a pro|mi&s;e
to abide by that already drawn up. Their Fa|ther,
&s;he was forced to confe&s;s, had now lent his eve|ry
guinea, for the debts of Clermont, to Sir Hugh;
and was at this in&s;tant, deliberating to whom he &s;hould
apply; but de&s;ired, meanwhile, an exact &s;tatement of
the debts which this man had in commi&s;&s;ion to di&s;|charge.
<PB N="239" REF="66">
The letter concluded with Lavinia's unfeign|ed
grief in the ta&s;k of writing it.</P>
<P>Camilla read it with a di&s;traction that made it
wholly unintelligible to her; yet could not read it a
&s;econd time; her eyes became dim, her faculties con|fu&s;ed,
and &s;he rather felt deprived of the power of
thinking, than filled with any new and dreadful &s;ub|jects
for rumination.</P>
<P>In this &s;tate, the letter on the floor, her eyes &s;taring
around, yet looking vacant, and &s;earching nothing,
&s;he was called to Lord O'Lerney, who begged the ho|nour
of a conference with her upon bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>She &s;hook her head, in token of denial, but could
not &s;peak. The &s;ervant looked amazed; yet brought
her a &s;econd me&s;&s;enger, that his Lord&s;hip was ex|tremely
&s;orry to torment her, but wi&s;hed to communi|cate
&s;omething concerning Mr. Macder&s;ey.</P>
<P>She then faintly articulated, &startq;I can &s;ee nobody.&endq;</P>
<P>Still the &s;ame dreadful vacuity &s;uper&s;eded her &s;en&s;i|bility,
till, &s;oon after, &s;he received a note f$om Lady
I&s;abella Irby, de&s;iring to be admitted to a &s;hort con|ver&s;ation
with her upon the part of Lord O'Lerney.</P>
<P>With the name of Lady I&s;abella Irby recurred the
remembrance that &s;he was a favourite of Edgar&mdash;and
bur&s;ting into tears, &s;he con&s;ented to the interview;
which took place immediately.</P>
<P>The terrible &s;tate in which &s;he appeared was natu|rally,
though not ju&s;tly, attributed by her lady&s;hip to
the elopement of her Cou&s;in: while Camilla, called
by her &s;ight to &s;ofter regrets, beheld again, in mental
view, the loved and gentle image of Edgar.</P>
<P>Lady I&s;abella apologi&s;ed politely, but briefly, for
her intru&s;ion, &s;aying: &startq;My Lord O'Lerney, who&s;e
judgment is never in any danger, but where wa$ped
by his wi&s;h of giving plea&s;ure, in&s;i&s;ts upon it that
you will be le&s;s incommoded by a quick forced ad|mi&s;&s;ion
of me than of him&s;elf. Nobody el&s;e will
think &s;o; but it is not ea&s;y to refu&s;e him; &s;o here I
am. The motive of this intru&s;ion you can but too
readily divine. Lord O'Lerney is truly concerned at
this ra&s;h action in his kin&s;man, which he learnt by an
<PB N="240" REF="67">
accidental call at his lodgings, where various circum|&s;tances
had ju&s;t made it known. He could not re&s;t
without de&s;i$ing to &s;ee &s;ome part of the young lady's
family, and making an offer of his his own be&s;t &s;er|vices
with re&s;pect to &s;ome arrangement for her fu|ture
e&s;tabli&s;hment. It is for this purpo&s;e, you have
been &s;o importunately hurried: Lord O'Lerney wi&s;h|ing
to make the fir&s;t news that is &s;ent to Sir Hugh
Tyrold le&s;s alarming, by &s;tating, at once, what he
can communicate concerning Mr. Macder&s;ey.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who only now recollected that Mr. Macder|&s;ey
was related to Lord O'Lerney, was &s;oftened into
&s;ome attention, and much gratitude for his goodne&s;s,
and for her Lady&s;hip's benevolence in being its me&s;&s;en|ger.</P>
<P>&startq;Will you, then,&endq; &s;aid Lady I&s;abella, &startq;now
you under&s;tand the purport of his vi&s;it, &s;ee Lord
O'Lerney him&s;elf? He can give you much better and
clearer documents than I can; and it is always the
be&s;t and &s;horte&s;t mode to deal with principals.</P>
<P>Camilla mechanically complied, and Lady I&s;abella
&s;ent her footman with a note to his Lord&s;hip, who was
waiting at her hou&s;e in Park-lane:</P>
<P>The di&s;cour&s;e &s;till fell wholly upon Lady I&s;abella;
Camilla, lo&s;t alternately in mi&s;ery and ab&s;ence, &s;poke
not, heard not; yet former &s;cenes, though not pre&s;ent
circum&s;tances, were brought to her mind by the ob|ject
before her, and almo&s;t with reverence, &s;he looked
at the favourite of Edgar, in who&s;e &s;weetne&s;s of coun|tennance,
good &s;en&s;e, delicacy, and propriety, &s;he con|ceived
her&s;elf reading every moment the cau&s;es of his
approbation. Ah, why, thought &s;he, while unable
to reply, or to li&s;ten to what was &s;aid, why knew I
not this charming woman, while yet he took an inte|re&s;t
in my conduct and connexions! Perhaps her gen|tle
wi&s;dom might have drawn me into its own path!
how would he have delighted to have &s;een me under
&s;uch influence! how now, even now,&mdash;lo&s;t to him as
I am!&mdash;would he generou&s;ly rejoice, could he view
the conde&s;cending partiality of looks and manner that
&s;eem to denote her di&s;po&s;ition to kindne&s;s!</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="68">
Lord O'Lerney &s;oon joined them; and after
thanking Camilla for granting, and his Amba&s;&s;a|dre&s;s
for obtaining him an audience, &s;aid; &startq;I have
been eager for the honour of a conference with
Mi&s;s Tyrold, in the hope of &s;omewhat alleviating
the fears for the future, that may naturally join
with di&s;plea&s;$re for the pre&s;ent, from the very un|advi&s;ed
&s;tep of this morning. But, however wrong
the manner in which this marriage may be effect|ed,
the alliance in it&s;elf will not I hope, be &s;o di&s;|advantageous,
as matches of this expeditious cha|racter
prove in general. The actual po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions of
Macder&s;ey are, indeed, far beneath what Mi&s;s
Lynmere, with her uncommon claims, might de|mand;
but his expectations are con&s;iderable, and
well founded; and his family will all come forward
to meet her, with every mark of re&s;pect, for
which, as its head, I &s;hall lead the way. He is
hone&s;t, honourable, and good natured; not parti|cularly
endowed with judgment or di&s;cretion,
but by no means wanting in parts, though they
are rather wild and eccentric.&endq;</P>
<P>His Lord&s;hip then gave a full and &s;atisfactory
detail of the pre&s;ent &s;tate, and future hopes of his
kin&s;man; and added, that it &s;hould be his own
immediate care to endeavour to &s;ecure for the fair
bride a fixed &s;ettlement, from the rich old cou&s;in
who had long promi&s;ed to make Macder&s;ey his
heir. He told Camilla to write this, without de|lay,
to the young lady's Uncle, with full leave to
u&s;e his name and authority.</P>
<P>&startq;At all times,&endq; he continued, &startq;it is nece&s;&s;ary
to be quick, and as explicit as po&s;&s;ible, in repre|&s;enting
what can conciliate an adventure of this
&s;ort, of which the clande&s;tine mea&s;ure implies on
one &s;ide, if not on both, &s;omething wrong; but
mo&s;t e&s;pecially it is nece&s;&s;ary to u&s;e &s;peed
where the flight is made with an Hibernian; for
with the Engli&s;h in general, it is nearly enough
that a man &s;hould be born in Ireland, to decide
him for a fortune-hunter. If you lived, how|ever,
in that country, you would &s;ee the matter
<PB N="242" REF="69">
pretty equally arranged; and that there are not
more of our pennyle&s;s beaux who return laden
with the commodity of rich wives, than of tho&s;e
better circum&s;tanced who bring home wives with
more e&s;timable dowries.&endq;</P>
<P>He then added, that it was from Mi&s;s Lynmere
her&s;elf he had learnt the re&s;idence of Camilla in
Gro&s;venor-&s;quare; for, having made &s;ome ac|quaintance
with her at one of Mrs. Berlinton's
evening parties, he had heard &s;he was a niece of
Sir Hugh Tyrold, and immediately enquired after
her fair kin&s;woman, whom he had &s;een at Tun|bridge.</P>
<P>Camilla thanked him for remembering her; and
Lady I&s;abella, with a countenance that implied
approbation in the remark, &s;aid; &startq;I have never
once heard of Mi&s;s Tyrold at the a&s;&s;emblies of this
hou&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>She quietly replied &s;he had never been pre&s;ent
at them; but a look of &s;en&s;ibility with which her
eyes dropt, &s;poke more than &s;he intended, of
concern at their exi&s;tence, or at lea&s;t frequency.</P>
<P>&startq;Your lovely young Ho&s;te&s;s,&endq; &s;aid Lord O'Ler|ney,
&startq;has entered the world at too early an hour
to be aware of the &s;urfeit &s;he is preparing her&s;elf,
by this unremitting luxury of plea&s;ure; but I
know &s;o well her innocence and good qualities,
that I doubt not but the error will bring its own
cure, and &s;he will gladly return to the literary and
elegant intercour&s;e, which &s;he has ju&s;t now given
up for one &s;o much more tumultuous.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am glad you &s;till think &s;o, my Lord;&endq; &s;aid
Lady I&s;abella, al&s;o looking down; &startq;&s;he is a very
&s;weet creature, and the little I have &s;een of her,
made me, while in her &s;ight, warmly her well-wi&s;her.
Neverthele&s;s I &s;hould rather &s;ee any
young per&s;on, for whom I was much intere&s;ted,
&mdash;unle&s;s endowed with the very remarkable for|bearance
of Mi&s;s Tyrold,&mdash;under her influence
after the period your Lord&s;hip expects to return,
than during its <HI>interregnum!</HI>&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="243" REF="70">
Camilla di&s;avowed all claim to &s;uch prai&s;e, blu&s;h|ing
both for her friend and her&s;elf at what was &s;aid.
Lord O'Lerney, looking concerned, pau&s;ed, and then
an&s;wered, &startq;You know my partiality for Mrs. Berlin|ton:
yet I always &s;ee with fre&s;h re&s;pect the courage
with which my dear Lady I&s;abella ca&s;ts a&s;ide her na|tive
re&s;erve and timidity, where &s;he thinks a hint&mdash;an
intimation&mdash;may do good, or avert dangers.&endq;</P>
<P>His eye was then fixed upon Camilla, who &s;urpriz|ed,
turned ha&s;tily to Lady I&s;abella, and &s;aw a tender
compa&s;&s;ion in her countenance, that confirmed the in|terpretation
of Lord O'Lerney; joined with a mode&s;t
confu&s;ion that &s;eemed afraid, or a&s;hamed, of what had
e&s;caped her.</P>
<P>Grateful for her&s;elf, but extremely grieved for the
idea that &s;eemed to have gone forth of Mrs. Berlinton,
&s;he felt a tear &s;tart into her eye. She chaced it, with
as little emotion as &s;he could &s;hew; and Lord O'Ler|ney,
with an air of gayer kindne&s;s, &s;aid; &startq;As we
mu&s;t now, Mi&s;s Tyrold, account our&s;elves to be
&s;omewhat allied, you permit me, I hope, to recom|mend
my gallant Cou&s;in to your protection with Sir
Hugh? That he has his &s;hare of the wildne&s;s, the
blunders, the eccentricities, and the rhodomontade,
which form, with you Engli&s;h, our &s;tationary national
character, mu&s;t not be denied; but he has al&s;o, what
may equally, I hope, be given us in the lump, gene|ro&s;ity,
&s;pirit, and good intentions. With all this&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>He was here interrupted; the door being &s;uddenly
bur&s;t open by Mrs. Mittin, who entered, exclaiming,
&startq;Lord, Mi&s;s, what a &s;ad thing this is! I declare its
put me quite into a quiver! And all Winche&s;ter's
quite in an uproar, as one may &s;ay. You never &s;ee
how every body's in a turmoil!&endq;</P>
<P>Here ended the little interval of horror in Camilla.
Mrs. Mittin and Mrs. Clykes &s;eemed to her as one;
yet that, already, her Cou&s;in's elopement &s;hould have
&s;pread &s;o near home, &s;eemed impo&s;&s;ible. &startq;When,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;were you in Winche&s;ter? And how came
this affair known to you?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="244" REF="71">
&startq;Known? why, my dear Mi&s;s, it was there it all
happened. I come through it with Mr. Dennel, who
was &s;o obliging as to bring me to town, for a little
bu&s;ine&s;s I've got to do; and next week he'll take me
back again; for as to poor little Mrs. Li&s;&s;in, &s;h$'ll be
quite lo&s;t without me. She don't know her right hand
from her left, as one may &s;ay. But how &s;hould &s;he,
poor child? Why &s;he is but a baby. What's fifteen?
And &s;he's no more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;We'll talk of that,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, colouring at
her loquacious familiarity, &startq;&s;ome other time.&endq; And
attempted to beg Lord O'Lerney would fini&s;h what he
was &s;aying. But Mrs. Mittin, &s;omewhat affronted,
cried, &startq;Lord, only think of your &s;itting here, talk|ing,
and making your&s;elf &s;o comfortable, ju&s;t as if
nothing was the matter! when every body el&s;e is in
&s;uch a taking as never was the like! I mu&s;t &s;ay, as to
that, a gentleman more liked, and in more re&s;pect ne|ver
was, I believe; and I can't &s;ay but what I'm
very &s;orry my&s;elf for what Mr. Clykes has done; how|ever,
I told you, you know, you'd be&s;t not provoke
him; for though there can't be a better &s;ort of man,
he'll leave no &s;tone unturned to get his money.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For Heaven's &s;ake,&endq; cried Camilla, &s;tartled,
&startq;what&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What?&mdash;Why, Lord, Mi&s;s! don't you know
your Papa's took up? He's put in Winche&s;ter Pri&s;on,
for that debt, you know.&endq;</P>
<P>The breath of Camilla in&s;tantly &s;topt, and &s;en&s;ele&s;s,
lifele&s;s, &s;he &s;unk upon the floor.&endq;</P>
<P>Lord O'Lerney quitted the room in great concern,
to call &s;ome female a&s;&s;i&s;tants; but Lady I&s;abella re|mained,
contributing with equal tenderne&s;s and judg|ment
to her aid, though much per&s;onally affected by
the incident.</P>
<P>Her recovery was quick, but it was only to de&s;|pair;
to &s;creams rather than lamentations, to cries ra|ther
than tears. Her rea&s;on felt the &s;hock as forcibly
as her heart: the one &s;eemed tottering on its &s;eat,
the other bur&s;ting its abode. Words of alarming in|coherency
proclaimed the danger menacing her intel|lects,
<PB N="245" REF="72">
while agonies nearly convul&s;ive di&s;torted her
features, and writhed her form.</P>
<P>Unaffectedly &s;hocked, yet not venturing, upon &s;o
&s;light an acquaintance, to interfere, Lady I&s;abella ut|tered
gently but impre&s;&s;ively her good wi&s;hes and con|cern,
and glided away.</P>
<P>The nearly di&s;tracted Camilla &s;aw not that &s;he went;
and knew no longer that &s;he had been in the room. She
held her forehead one moment; called for death the
next; and the next wildly deprecated eternal puni&s;hment.
But as the horror nearly intolerable of this fir&s;t abrupt
blow gave way, the de&s;ire of flying in&s;tantly to her
father was the &s;ymptom of re&s;tor$d recollection.</P>
<P>Ha&s;tening then to Mi&s;s Margland, &s;he conjured her,
by all that was mo&s;t affecting, to &s;et off immediately
for Winche&s;ter. But Mi&s;s Margland, though &s;he
&s;pared not the mo&s;t &s;evere attacks upon the already
&s;elf-condemned and nearly-demoli&s;hed Camilla, always
found &s;omething relative to her&s;elf that was more
pre&s;&s;ing than what could regard any other, and de|clared
&s;he could not &s;tir from town till &s;he received
an an&s;wer from Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>Camilla be&s;ought at lea&s;t to have the carriage; but
of this &s;he a&s;&s;erted her&s;elf at pre&s;ent the indi&s;putable
mi&s;tre&s;s, and as the expre&s;s might come back in a few
hours, with directions that &s;he &s;hould &s;et off immedi|ately,
&s;he would not li&s;ten to parting with it. Ca|milla,
frantic to be gone, flew then down &s;t$i$s, and
called to the porter in the hall, that &s;ome one &s;hould
in&s;tantly &s;eek her a chai&s;e, coach, or any conveyance
whatever, that could carry her to Winche&s;ter.</P>
<P>She perceived not that Lady I&s;abella, waiting for
her footman, who had, accidentally, gone on further,
upon &s;ome me&s;&s;age, now opened the door of the par|lour,
where Lord O'Lerney was conver&s;ing with her
upon what had happened: &s;he was flying back, though
not knowing whither nor which way &s;he turned, when
Lord O'Lerney, gently &s;topping her, a&s;ked, why &s;he
would not, on &s;uch an emergence, apply for the carri|age
of Mrs. Berlinton? Lady I&s;abella &s;econded the
motion, by a &s;oft, but ju&s;t hint, of the danger of her
<PB N="246" REF="73">
taking &s;uch a journey, in a hired carriage, entirely
unprotected.</P>
<P>She had &s;carce con&s;ideration enough left to either
thank or under&s;tand them, yet mechanically followed
their coun&s;el, and went to Mrs. Berlinton; Lord
O'Lerney, deeply touched by her di&s;tre&s;s, &s;ending
in a &s;ervant at the &s;ame time with his name, and fol|lowing:
while Lady I&s;abella, too much intere&s;ted to
go till &s;omething was decided, quietly &s;hut her&s;elf
into the parlour, there to wait his Lord&s;hip's informa|tion.</P>
<P>The reque&s;t for the carriage was, indeed, rather
made by him than by Camilla, who, when &s;he entered
the room, and would have &s;poken, found her&s;elf de|prived
of the power of utterance, and looked a picture
of &s;peechle&s;s di&s;may.</P>
<P>The tender feelings of Mrs Berlinton were all im|mediately
awakened by this &s;ight, and &s;he eagerly an|&s;wered
Lord O'Lerney, that both her carriage and
her&s;elf &s;hould be devoted to her di&s;tre&s;&s;ed friend; yet,
the fir&s;t emotion over, &s;he recollected an engagement
&s;he could not break, though one &s;he he&s;itated to men|tion,
and at la&s;t only alluded to unexplained, though
making known it was in&s;urmountable; while the co|lour,
of which her late hours had robbed her lovely
cheeks, returned to them as &s;he &s;tammered her retracta|tion.</P>
<P>The next day, however, &s;he was beginning to pro|mi&s;e,
&mdash;but Camilla, to whom the next minute &s;eem|ed
endle&s;s, flew down again to the hall, to &s;upplicate
the fir&s;t &s;ootman &s;he could meet, to run and order any
&s;ort of carriage he could find; with but barely &s;uffici|ent
recollection to refrain running out with that view
her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Lady I&s;abella, again coming forth, entreated to
know if there were any commi&s;&s;ion, any po&s;&s;ible &s;er|vice
&s;he could her&s;elf perform. Camilla thanked her,
without knowing what &s;he &s;aid; and Lord O'Lorney,
who was de&s;cending the &s;tairs, repeated &s;imilar offers.
But wild with affright, or &s;huddering with horror, &s;he
pa&s;&s;ed without hearing or ob&s;erving him.</P>
<P><PB N="247" REF="74">
To &s;ee a young creature in a &s;tate &s;o deplorable,
and to con&s;ider her as travelling without any friend or
&s;upport, in &s;o &s;haken a condition, to vi&s;it an impri&s;on|ed
Father, touched tho&s;e benign ob&s;ervers with the
&s;incere&s;t commi&s;eration; and the connexion of a part
of his family forming at this moment with a branch
of her own, induced Lord O'Lerney to believe he
was almo&s;t bound to take care of her him&s;elf. &startq;And
yet,&endq; &s;aid he to Lady I&s;abella, &startq;though I am old
enough to be her grandfather, the world, &s;hould I
travel with her, might impute my a&s;&s;i&s;tance to a &s;pe|cies
of admiration which I hope to experience no
more&mdash;as witne&s;s my tru&s;ting my&s;elf &s;o much with
Lady I&s;abella Irby!&endq;</P>
<P>Lady I&s;abella, from the quick coincidence of &s;imilar
feelings, in&s;tantly conceived his wi&s;hes, and pau&s;ed
to weigh their po&s;&s;ibility. A &s;hort con&s;ideration was
&s;ufficient for this purpo&s;e. It brought to her memo|ry
her various engagements; but it repre&s;ented at the
&s;ame time to her benevolence that they would be all,
by the performance of one good action,</P>
<P>More honour'd in the breach than the ob&s;ervance:</P>
<P>She &s;ent, therefore, a m$&s;&s;age after Camilla, en|treating
a &s;hort conference.</P>
<P>Camilla, who was trying to comprehend &s;ome fur|ther
account from Mrs. Mitten, &s;ilently, but ha&s;tily
obeyed the call; and her look of wild angui&s;h would
have fixed the benign intention of Lady I&s;abella, had
it been wavering. In a &s;imple phra&s;e, but with a
manner the mo&s;t delicate, her Lady&s;hip then offered
to conduct her to Winche&s;ter. A &s;ervice &s;o unex|pected,
a goodne&s;s &s;o con&s;oling, in&s;tantly brought
Camilla to the u&s;e of her frightened away faculties,
but with &s;en&s;ations of gratitude &s;o forcible, that Lord
O'Lerney with difficulty &s;aved her from falling at the
&s;eet of his amiable friend, and with yet more difficul|ty
re&s;trained his own knees from doing her that $o|mage.
And &s;till the more &s;trongly he felt this active
exertion, from the di&s;appointment he had ju&s;t endure$
through the failure of his favourite Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="75">
No time was to be lo&s;t; Lady I&s;abella determined
to do well what &s;he once undertook to do at all;
&s;he went to Park-lane, to make known her excur|&s;ion,
and arrange &s;ome affairs, and then in&s;tantly
returned, in her own po&s;t-chai&s;e and four hor&s;es,
for Camilla; who was driven from the metropolis.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP XXVI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Operation of Terror.</HEAD>
<P>LADY I&s;abella, for the fir&s;t two or three miles,
left Camilla uninterruptedly to her own thoughts;
&s;he then endeavoured to engage her in &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e,
but was &s;oon forced to de&s;i&s;t. Her mi&s;ery exceeded
all mea&s;ure of re&s;traint, all power of effort. Her
Father in pri&s;on! and for her own debts! The
picture was too horrible for her view, yet too
adhe&s;ive to all her thoughts, all her feelings, all
her faculties, to be removed from them a moment.
Penetrated by what &s;he owed to Lady I&s;abella, &s;he
frequently took her hand, pre&s;&s;ed it between her
own, pre&s;&s;ed it to her lips; but could &s;hew her
no other gratitude, and force her&s;elf to no other
exertion.</P>
<P>It was &s;till early, they travelled po&s;t, and with
four hor&s;es, and arrived at Winche&s;ter before
eight o'clock.</P>
<P>Shaking, &s;he entered the town, half fainting,
half dead. Lady I&s;abella would have driven &s;traight
on to Etherington, which was but a &s;tage further;
but to enter the rectory, whence the Rector him|&s;elf
was torn&mdash;&startq;No!&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;no! there
where abides my Father, there alone will I abide!
No roof &s;hall cover my head, but that which
covers his! I have no wi&s;h but to &s;ink at his feet&mdash;
to crawl in the du&s;t&mdash;to confine my&s;elf to the
harde&s;t labour for the remnant of my mi&s;erable
<PB N="249" REF="76">
exi&s;tence, &s;o it might expiate but this guilty out|rage!</P>
<P>Lady I&s;abella took not any advantage of the an|gui&s;h
that was thus bur&s;ting forth with &s;ecret
hi&s;tory; &s;he was too delicate and too good to
&s;eize &s;uch a moment for &s;urpri&s;ing confidence, and
only required if &s;he had any friend in the town,
who could direct her whither to go, and accom|pany
as well as direct.</P>
<P>She knew no one with &s;ufficient intimacy to en|dure
pre&s;enting her&s;elf to them upon &s;uch an
occa&s;ion; and preferred proceeding alone to the
&s;ad and cruel interview. Lady I&s;abella ordered
the chai&s;e to an hotel, where &s;he was &s;hewn into a
room up &s;tairs, whence &s;he &s;ent one of her own
&s;ervants to enquire out where debtors were con|fined,
and if Mr. Tyrold were in cu&s;tody: charg|ing
him not to name, from whom or why he came,
and begging Camilla to get ready a note to prepare
her Father for the meeting, and prevent any
affecting &s;urpri&s;e. She then went to chu&s;e her&s;elf
a chamber, determined not to quit her voluntary
charge, till &s;he &s;aw her in the hands of her own
friends.</P>
<P>Camilla could not write: to kneel, to weep, $$|&s;ue,
was all &s;he could bear to plan; to pre&s;ent to
him the &s;ight of her hand writing &s;he had not
courage.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently &s;he heard a chai&s;e drive rapidly through
the inn gate: it might be he, perhaps relea&s;ed;
&s;he flew down the &s;tairs with that hope; but no
&s;ooner had de&s;cended them, than a dread of his
view took its place, and &s;he ran back: &s;he &s;topt,
however, in the landing place, to hear who entered.</P>
<P>Suddenly a voice &s;truck her ear that made her
&s;tart; that vibrated quick to her heart, and there
&s;eemed to arre&s;t the &s;prings of life: &s;he thought it
the voice of her Mother&mdash;</P>
<P>It cea&s;ed to &s;peak; and &s;he dropt on one knee,
inwardly, but fervently praying her &s;en&s;es might
deceive her.</P>
<P><PB N="250" REF="77">
Again, however, and more di&s;tinctly, it reached
her; doubt then cea&s;ed, terror next to horror
took its place. What was &s;aid &s;he knew not, her
trepidation was too great to take in more than the
&s;ound.</P>
<P>Pro&s;trate &s;he fell on the floor; but hearing a
waiter &s;ay, &startq;Up &s;tairs, madam, you may have a
room to your&s;elf.&endq; She &s;tarted, ro&s;e, and ru&s;hing
violently back to the apartment &s;he had quitted,
bolted her&s;elf in; exclaiming &startq;I am not worthy
to &s;ee you, my Mother! I have ca&s;t my Father in|to
pri&s;on&mdash;and I know you will abhor me!&endq;</P>
<P>She then &s;at down again&s;t the door, to li&s;ten if
&s;he were pur&s;ued; &s;he heard a foot&s;tep, a female
&s;tep; &s;he concluded it that of her Mother; She
can come,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;but to give me her male|diction!&endq;
And flew frantic about the room, look|ing
for any means of e&s;cape, yet perceiving only
the window, whence &s;he mu&s;t be da&s;hed to de|&s;truction.</P>
<P>She now heard a hand upon the lock of the
door. &startq;O that I could die! that I could die!&endq;
&s;he cried, madly advancing to the window, and
throwing up the &s;a&s;h, yet with quick in&s;tinctive
repentance pulling it down, &s;huddering and ex|claiming:
&startq;Is there no death for me but murder
&mdash;no murder but &s;uicide?&endq;</P>
<P>A voice now found its way through her cries to
her ear, that &s;aid, &startq;It is I, my dear Mi&s;s
Tyrold; will you not admit me?&endq;</P>
<P>It was Lady I&s;abella; but her mother might be
with her: &s;he could not, however, refu&s;e to open
the door, though de&s;perately &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf:
If &s;he is there, I will pa&s;s her, and ru&s;h into the
&s;treets!</P>
<P>Seeing, however, Lady I&s;abella alone, &s;he dropt
on her knees, ejaculating &startq;Thank Heaven! thank
Heaven! one moment yet I am &s;pared!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is it, my dear Mi&s;s Tyrold,&endq; &s;aid Lady
I&s;abella, &startq;that cau&s;es you this &s;udden agony?
what can it be that thus dreadfully di&s;orders you?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="251" REF="78">
&startq;Is &s;he with you?&endq; cried &s;he, in a voice &s;carce

<P>&startq;Ri&s;e, dear madam, and compo&s;e your&s;elf. If

order the chai&s;e, and return to town.</P>
<P>&startq;On the contrary,&endq; an&s;wered her Lady&s;hip,
extremely &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;o wild a reque&s;t, &startq;Let me

<P>&startq;O no, Lady I&s;abella, no! cried Camilla,
&s;peaking with frightful rapidity, and &s;haking in
every limb, &startq;all now is changed. I came to wait
upon my Father&mdash;to humble my&s;elf at his feet&mdash;
not to obtrude my&s;elf upon my Mother!&mdash;O Lady
I&s;abella!&mdash;I &s;hall have broken her heart&mdash;and I
dare not offend her with my &s;ight!&endq;</P>
<P>Lady I&s;abella, with the mo&s;t judicious gentle|ne&s;s,
endeavoured to render her more rea&s;onable.
&startq;I pretend not,&endq; &s;he &s;aid, &startq;to decide upon your
&s;ituation, though I comprehend its general afflic|tion:

mu&s;t be a meeting. Suffer me, therefore, rather
to ha&s;ten than retard &s;o right a mea&s;ure. Allow
of my mediation, and give me the infinite plea|&s;ure
of leaving you in the hands of your friends.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, though &s;carcely able to articulate her
words, declared again the motive to her journey was
at an end; that her Father had now one to watch,
&s;oothe, and attend him, who had none of her
dreadful drawbacks to con&s;oling powers; and that
&s;he would remain at Mrs Berlinton's till &s;ummoned
home by their immediate commands.</P>
<P><PB N="252" REF="79">
Lady I&s;abella began pleading their own rights to
decide if or not the meeting &s;hould be deferred:
but wildly interrupting her, &startq;You know not,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;what it is you a&s;k. I have not nerves,
I have not hardine&s;s to force my&s;elf into &s;uch a

<P>&startq;Let me go to them from you, my&s;elf; let me

together. That Lady whom I &s;aw but from the

and whom I now conclude to be Mrs. Tyrold,
&s;aid, as &s;he pa&s;&s;ed, I &s;hall walk; I only want a
guide;&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;They had not, then, even met!&endq; cried Ca|milla,
&s;tarting up with fre&s;h horror; &startq;&s;he is but
ju&s;t arrived&mdash;has but ju&s;t been at Etherington&mdash;
and there heard&mdash;that her hu&s;band was in pri&s;on&mdash;
and in pri&s;on for the debts of her daughter! her
guilty&mdash;perhaps reprobated daughter!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Again, wringing her hands, half di&s;tracted, &startq;O,
that the earth,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;had received me, ere
I quitted the parental roof! Innocent I had then
died, beloved, regretted,&mdash;no &s;hame would have
embittered my Father's &s;orrow&mdash;no wrath my

blighted with di&s;grace their &s;o long&mdash;long wi&s;hed-for

<P>The compa&s;&s;ionating, yet judicious Lady I&s;abella,
willing to &s;horten the &s;ufferings &s;he pitied, made

Winche&s;ter, that Camilla might gather &s;ome par|ticulars
of her family, and &s;ome compo&s;ure for
her&s;elf, to better judge what &s;tep to pur&s;ue. But
all de&s;ire of meeting was now converted into hor|ror;
&s;he was too much known in the neighbour|hood
to e&s;cape being recognized if &s;he &s;tayed till
the morning, and her &s;hattered intellects, &s;he de|clared
could not bear pa&s;&s;ing a whole night in ex|pectation

of a di&s;covery through &s;ome accident.
&startq;Have I not already,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;heard her
voice and fled its &s;ound? Judge then, Lady I&s;a|bella,

<P>Lady I&s;abella knew too little of the characters
with which &s;he had to deal, to judge if it would
be right to in&s;i&s;t any further: &s;he ordered, there|fore
fre&s;h hor&s;es to her chai&s;e, and as &s;oon as her
footman came back, who brought the now u&s;ele&s;s
direction where Mr. Tyrold was to be found, they
gallopped out of Winche&s;ter.</P>
<P>At Alton they &s;topt to &s;leep; and, her imme|diate
terror removed, &s;he became mo$e &s;en&s;ible of
what &s;he owed to Lady I&s;abella, to whom in the
cour&s;e of the evening, &s;he recounted frankly the
whole hi&s;tory of her debts, except what related to
Lionel.</P>
<P>&startq;Your Lady&s;hip hears me,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, in conclu|&s;ion,

From day to day, from hour to hour, I planned
expedients, where I ought to have made confe&s;|&s;ions!

Lady I&s;abella, much touched by her openne&s;s

the amount of the &s;um for which Mr. Tyrold was
confined, and be&s;ought Camilla to let it le&s;s weigh
upon her &s;pirits, as &s;he could her&s;elf undertake

<P>Camilla returned the mo&s;t grateful thanks; but
acknowledged &s;he had no apprehen&s;ion but that

debt will be ea&s;ily di&s;charged, its payment by a
loan is but incurring another: and how that is to
be paid, I know not indeed. Alas! Lady I&s;abella!
&mdash;the Father I have thus dreadfully involved, has
hitherto, throughout his exemplary life, held it a
&s;acred duty to adapt his expences to his income!&endq;</P>
<P>Again Lady I&s;abella gave what con&s;olation &s;he
could be&s;tow; and in return for her tru&s;t, &s;aid &s;he
would &s;peak to her with &s;incerity upon a point of
much delicacy. It was of her friend, Mrs. Ber|linton;
&startq;who now,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, &startq;you are not,
perhaps, aware, is become a general topic of di&s;|cour&s;e.
To the platonics, with which &s;he &s;et out
in life, &s;he has, of late, joined coquetry; nor
even there &s;tops the ardour with which &s;he &s;eeks
to animate her exi&s;tence; to two characters, hi|therto
thought the mo&s;t contradictory, the &s;enti|mental
and the flirting, &s;he unites yet a third, till
<PB N="255" REF="82">
now believed incompatible with the plea&s;ures and
pur&s;uits of either; this, I need not tell you, is that
of a game&s;tre&s;s. And when to three &s;uch attri|butes
is added an open aver&s;ion to her hu&s;band, a
profe&s;&s;ed, an even boa&s;ted hatred of his per&s;on, his
name, his very being&mdash;what hope can be enter|tained,
be her heart, her intentions, what they
may, that the various dangers &s;he &s;ets at defiance,
will not ultimately take their revenge, and &s;ur|pri&s;e
her in their trammels?&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar him&s;elf &s;eemed, to Camilla, to be &s;peak|ing
in this repre&s;entation; and that idea made it
catch her attention, in the mid&s;t of her utmo&s;t
mi&s;ery. She urged, however, all &s;he knew, and
could &s;ugge&s;t, in favour of Mrs. Berlinton; and
Lady I&s;abella expre&s;&s;ed much concern in occa&s;ion|ing
her any painful &s;en&s;ations. &startq;But who,&endq; &s;aid
&s;he, &startq;can &s;ee you thus nearly, and not be inter|e&s;ted
in your happine&s;s? And I have known, alas!
&mdash;though I am &s;till under thirty, in&s;tances innu|merable
of &s;elf-deluded young women, who, tru&s;t|ing
to their own pure intentions, have neither
feared nor heeded the dangers which encircled
them, till imperceptibly, from the in&s;idious influ|ence
of levity, they have pur&s;ued the very cour&s;e
they began with di&s;claiming, and followed the very
&s;teps from which at fir&s;t they unaffectedly recoiled.&endq;</P>
<P>In&s;tructed and grateful, though incapable of
being tranquilli&s;ed. Camilla the next day reached
Gro&s;venor &s;quare long before her fair friend had
left her downy pillow. Lady I&s;abella exacted a
promi&s;e to be informed of her proceedings, and
loaded with merited acknowledgments, returned
to her own man&s;ion.</P>
<P>Camilla took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the fir&s;t room in
which &s;he found a p$$ and ink, and wrote in&s;tantly
to Lavinia a &s;hort, rapid, and incoherent letter,
upon the di&s;traction of her mind at the dreadful
calamity &s;he had occa&s;ioned her Father, and the
accumulated horrors to which her Mother had re|turned.
She dur&s;t not pre&s;ent her&s;elf before them
<PB N="256" REF="83">
uncalled, not even by letter; but &s;he would live in
the &s;tricte&s;t retirement and penance till they or|dered
her home, for which epoch, not more
longed than dreaded, &s;he be&s;ought her &s;i&s;ter's me|diation.</P>
<P>This &s;ent off, &s;he forced her&s;elf to wait upon
Mi&s;s Margland, who had received an an&s;wer from
Cleves to continue in town till Indiana wrote or
re-appeared. She was put immediately into un|common
good humour, by the ill &s;ucce&s;s of the
journey of Camilla, which &s;he prote&s;ted was ex|actly
what &s;he expected.</P>
<P>Camilla then &s;trove to recollect all &s;he had been
told by Lord O'Lerney of Mr. Macder&s;ey, and to
relate it to Mi&s;s Margland, who, plea&s;ed and &s;ur|pri&s;ed,
undertook to write it to Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>To three days of dreadful &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;he now &s;aw
her&s;elf inevitably condemned, in waiting an an&s;wer
from Lavinia: but as her eyes were opened to re|mark,
by the admonitions of Lady I&s;abella, and
her attention was called back to the earlier cautions
of Edgar, her time, though &s;pent with mi&s;ery,
hung not upon her unoccupied. She thought her|&s;elf
called upon by every tie of friend&s;hip, faith|fully
and courageou&s;ly to repre&s;ent to Mrs. Berlin|ton
her impropriety of conduct with regard to
Bellamy, and the reports that were &s;pread abroad
to her more general di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>Her reception from that Lady, &s;he had thought,
for the fir&s;t time cold. She had welcomed her,
indeed, with an accu&s;tomed embrace, but her
kindne&s;s &s;eemed &s;trained, her &s;mile was faint, and
the eyes which &s;o &s;oftly u&s;ed to &s;econd it, were
averted.</P>
<P>As &s;oon as they were alone together, Camilla
took her hand; but, without returning its pre&s;&s;ure,
Mrs. Berlinton pre&s;ented her with a new poem for
her evening's amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Camilla put it down, but while he&s;itating how
to begin, Bellamy was announced. She &s;tarted,
and flew away, but returned when he was gone,
and begged a conference.</P>
<P><PB N="257" REF="84">
Mrs. Berlinton an&s;wered certainly; though &s;he look|ed
embarra&s;&s;ed, and added not immediately, as &s;he
was obliged to dre&s;s for the evening.</P>
<P>Camilla entreated &s;he might &s;peak with her before
dinner the next day.</P>
<P>To this &s;he received a gentle a&s;&s;ent: but no inter|view
at the time appointed took place; and when
at dinner they met, no notice was taken of the ne|glect.</P>
<P>She now &s;aw &s;he was pointedly avoided. Her cou|rage,
however, was called upon, her gratitude was
indebted for pa&s;t kindne&s;&s;es, and her honour felt a
double engagement. The opportunity therefore &s;he
could not obtain by reque&s;t, &s;he re&s;olved to &s;eize by
&s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>Bellamy was again, however, announced; but the
moment that, from her own chamber, &s;he heard him
de&s;cend the &s;tairs, &s;he flew to the dre&s;&s;ing-room, and
abruptly entered it.</P>
<P>The &s;urpri&s;e &s;he gave was not greater than that &s;he
received. Mrs. Berlinton, her fine eyes &s;treaming
with tears, and her white hands uplifted with an air
of &s;upplication, was evidently in an act of devotion.
Camilla drew back, and would have retired, but &s;he
ha&s;tily dried her eyes, and &s;aid: &startq;Mi&s;s Tyrold, do
you want me? where's Mi&s;s&mdash;Mi&s;s Marg$and?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah! my deare&s;t Mrs. Berlinton! my friend, as
I had hoped, and by me, &s;urely I tru&s;t loved for ever,&endq;
cried Camilla, throwing her arms round her neck,
&startq;why this &s;orrow? why this di&s;tance? why this un|kind
avoidance?&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who, at fir&s;t, had &s;hrunk from her
embrace, now fell, in trembling agitation, upon her
brea&s;t. Camilla hoped this was the in&s;tant to im|prove;
when &s;he appeared to be, her&s;elf, calling re|ligion
to her aid, and when the tenderne&s;s of her ap|peal
&s;eemed to bring back a movement of her fir&s;t
partiality.&endq; &startq;Suffer, &s;uffer me,&endq; &s;he therefore cri|ed,
&startq;to &s;peak to you now! hear me, my dear and
amiable friend, with the &s;weetne&s;s that fir&s;t won my
affection!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="258" REF="85">
&startq;Mrs. Berlinton, affrighted, drew back, acknow|ledging
her&s;elf unhappy; but &s;hrinking from all di&s;|cour&s;e,
and &s;tarting when Camilla named Bellamy,
with a confu&s;ion &s;he vainly &s;trove to repre&s;s.</P>
<P>Unhackneyed in the world as was Camilla, her
under&s;tanding and &s;en&s;e of right &s;tood here in the place
of experience, to point out the danger and impropriety
&s;urrounding her friend; and catching her by the gown,
as &s;he would have quitted the room, &startq;Mrs. Berlin|ton,&endq;
&s;he emphatically cried, &startq;if you per&s;i&s;t in this
unhappy, this perilous intercour&s;e, you ri&s;k your re|putation,
you ri&s;k my &s;i&s;ter's peace, you ri&s;k even
your own future condemnation!&mdash;O forgive me&mdash;for|give
me! I &s;ee how I have affected you&mdash;but you
would li&s;ten to no milder words!&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton had &s;unk upon a chair; her hands
cla&s;ped upon her forehead, and tears running rapidly
down her cheeks. Brought up with religious terrors,
yet ill in&s;tructed in religious principles, the dread of
future puni&s;hment nearly demoli&s;hed her, though no
regular creed of right kept her con&s;i&s;tently or &s;y&s;tema|tically
in any uniform exerci&s;e of good. But thus
forcibly &s;urpri&s;ed into &s;udden con&s;cientious recollec|tions,
&s;he betrayed, rather than opened her heart, and
acknowledged that &s;he was weeping at a denial &s;he
had given to Bellamy; who, mole&s;ted by the impo&s;&s;i|bility
of ever conver&s;ing with her undi&s;turbed, had
entreated her to grant him, from time to time, a few
hours &s;ociety, in a peaceful retirement. &startq;Nor
&s;hould I&mdash;nor could I&mdash;&endq; &s;he cried, refu&s;e him&mdash;for
I have every reliance in his honour&mdash;but that the
guilty world, ignorant of the purity of our friend&s;hip,
might cau&s;ele&s;sly alarm my brother for my fame. And
this, and the fear of any&mdash;though &s;o groundle&s;s&mdash;
unea&s;ine&s;s to your &s;i&s;ter, makes me re&s;i&s;t his powerful
eloquence, and even my own notions of what is
due to our exalted league of friend&s;hip.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla li&s;tened with horror to this avowal, yet
&s;aw, with compa&s;&s;ion, that her friend endeavoured
to per&s;uade her&s;elf &s;he was free from wrong; though
<PB N="259" REF="86">
with cen&s;ure, that &s;he &s;ought to glo&s;s over, rather than
inve&s;tigate, every doubt to the contrary: but while
fear was predominant for the event of &s;uch a &s;ituation
to her&s;elf, abhorrence filled her whole mind again&s;t
Bellamy, in every part, every plan, and every proba|bility
of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;O Mrs. Berlinton!&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;conquer this
terrible infatuation, which ob&s;cures danger from your
&s;ight, and right from your di&s;cernment! Mr. Bellamy
is married; and if you think, your&s;elf, my &s;i&s;ter
would be hurt to know of the&s;e unhallowed leagues
and bonds, you mu&s;t be &s;ure, with the lea&s;t reflection,
that they are wrong; you too, are married; and if
Mr. Melmond would join with the world in contemn|ing
the extraordinary project you mention, you mu&s;t
feel, with the lea&s;t reflexion, it ought not to be grant|ed.
Even were you both &s;ingle, it would be equally
improper, though not &s;o wide &s;preading in its mi&s;chief.
I have committed many errors; yet not one of them
wilfully, or again&s;t conviction: neverthele&s;s, the ill
con&s;equences that have en&s;ued, tear me at this mo|ment
with repentant &s;orrow:&mdash;Ah! think then, what
you&mdash;&s;o tender, &s;o &s;u&s;ceptible, &s;o feeling, will &s;uffer,
if with your apprehen&s;ions all awake, you li&s;ten to
any reque&s;t that may make my &s;i&s;ter unhappy, or in|volve
your de&s;erving brother in any difficulty or ha|zard!&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton was now &s;ubdued. Touched, terri|fied,
and convinced, &s;he embraced Camilla, wept in
her arms, and promi&s;ed to &s;ee Bellamy no more.</P>
<P>The next day arrived an an&s;wer from Lavinia, long,
minute, and melancholy, but tenderly affectionate and
replete with pity.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, my &s;i&s;ter,&endq; &s;he began, &startq;we cannot yet
meet! Our Mother is in no &s;tate to bear any added
emotion. The firmne&s;s of her whole character, the
fortitude of her whole life, hitherto unbroken by any
pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;uperior to any misfortune, have both
given way, &s;uddenly and dreadfully, to the &s;cene fol|lowing
her arrival.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="260" REF="87">
She then went back to particulars.</P>
<P>Mr. Clykes, &s;he had heard, finding his bill for his
own trouble po&s;itively refu&s;ed, had conceived the Ty|rold
family in danger of bankruptcy, by the general
rumours of the joint claimants of Lionel and Cler|mont;
and imagining he had no time to lo&s;e, hoped
by an arre&s;t to frighten their Father to terms, in order
to obviate the di&s;grace of &s;uch a mea&s;ure. Their Fa|ther
would however, hear of none, nor pay any thing
above the exact amount of the &s;igned receipts of the
various creditors; and &s;ubmitted to the confinement,
in preference to applying to any friend to be his bail,
till he could con&s;ult with a lawyer. He was already
at Winche&s;ter, where he had given Clykes a meet|ing,
when the writ was &s;erved again&s;t him. He &s;ent
a di&s;patch to Etherington, to prevent any &s;urpri&s;e at
his not returning, and to de&s;ire the affair might not
travel to Cleves, where Lavinia was then with Sir
Hugh. This note, addre&s;&s;ed to the upper &s;ervant,
fell into the hands of Mrs. Tyrold her&s;elf, the next
evening, upon her &s;udden arrival. She had been thus
unexpectedly brought back by the news of the flight of
Bellamy with Eugenia; her brother was &s;till ill, but
every con&s;ideration gave way to the maternal; and in
the hope to yet re&s;ue her daughter from this violator,
&s;he &s;et off in a packet which was ju&s;t &s;ailing. But
what, upon de&s;cending from the chai&s;e, was the hor|ror
of her fir&s;t news! She went on in&s;tantly to Win|che&s;ter,
and alighting at an hotel, took a guide and
went to the place of confinement.</P>
<P>&startq;The meeting that en&s;ued,&endq; continued Lavinia,
&startq;no one witne&s;&s;ed, but every one may imagine. I
will not therefore, wound your feelings, my deare&s;t
Camilla, with even touching upon my own. The
impre&s;&s;ion, however, left upon the mind of our poor
Mother, I &s;hould try vainly to di&s;gui&s;e, &s;ince it has
given her a &s;hock that has forced from me the open|ing
of this letter.&endq;</P>
<P>She then be&s;ought her to take, neverthele&s;s, &s;ome
comfort, &s;ince &s;he had the un&s;peakable &s;atisfaction to
inform her that their Father was returned to the rec|tory.
<PB N="261" REF="88">
He had been liberated, from the writ's being
withdrawn; though without his con&s;ent, without even
his knowledge, and contrary to his wi&s;hes. Nor was
it yet a&s;certained by whom this was done, though cir|cum&s;tances
allowed no divi&s;ion to their conjectures.</P>
<P>Harry We&s;twyn had learnt the terrible event in a
ride he had accidentally taken to Winche&s;ter; and,
upon returning to Cleves, had communicated it, with
the mo&s;t feeling circum&s;pection, to her&s;elf. The ex|ce&s;s
of grief with which &s;he had heard him, had
&s;eemed to penetrate to his quickly &s;en&s;itive &s;oul, &startq;for
he is yet more amiable&punc;&endq; &s;he added, &startq;than his Fa|ther's
partiality paints him;&endq; they agreed not to name
it to Sir Hugh; though Harry a&s;&s;ured her that no
le&s;s than five gentlemen in the vicinity had already
flown to Mr. Tyrold, to conjure to be accepted as
his bail: but he cho&s;e fir&s;t to con&s;ult his lawyer
upon the validity of the claim made again&s;t him. All
their care, however, was ineffectual; through &s;ome
of the &s;ervants, Sir Hugh was informed of the affair,
and his affliction was de&s;pair. He accu&s;ed him&s;elf as
being the cau&s;e of this evil, from the money he had
borrowed for Clermont, which might wholly have
been avoided, had he followed his brother's advice in
immediate and &s;evere retrenchments. The&s;e, how|ever,
he now began, in a manner that threatened to
rob him of every comfort; and Mr. We&s;twyn was &s;o
much affected by his di&s;tre&s;s, that, to relieve him, at
lea&s;t, from the expence of two gue&s;ts and their &s;er|vants,
he in&s;tantly took leave, promi&s;ing neverthele&s;s,
to yet &s;ee him again, before he returned for the re&s;t
of his days to his native home. In a few hours after
the departure of the&s;e gentlemen, news arrived that
Mr. Tyrold was again at the rectory. Mr. Clykes
had &s;uddenly &s;ent his receipt, in full of all demands,
and then &s;et off for London.</P>
<P>&startq;There cannot be a doubt this was the deed of
the generous Mr. We&s;twyn, in compact with his de|&s;erving
S$n,&endq; continued Lavinia; &startq;they have been
traced to Winche&s;ter; but we none of us know where,
at pre&s;ent, to direct to them. The delight of my Uncle
<PB N="262" REF="89">
at this act of his worthy old friend, has extremely re|vived
him. My Father is much di&s;&s;atisfied the wretch|ed
Clykes &s;hould thus be paid all his fraudulent claims,
but my Mother and my Uncle would, I believe, &s;carce
have &s;upported life under his longer confinement.&endq;</P>
<P>The letter thus concluded.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>&startq;My Mother, when fir&s;t &s;he heard you were in
town, was her&s;elf going to &s;end for you; but when

dreadful pangs of finding the haple&s;s fate of Eugenia
irremediable, was added the baneful &s;ight of an adored

<P>A wi&s;h for death, immediate death, in common

the reading, or remained after the fini&s;hing of

no longer wi&s;hes to &s;ee m$!&endq;</P>

a convul&s;ive &s;hivering, from feelings over-&s;trained, and
nerves dreadfully &s;hattered, &s;eized her; &s;he &s;ighed
&s;hort and quick, and thought her prayer already ac|compli&s;hing;
but the delu&s;ion &s;oon cea&s;ed; &s;he found
life &s;till in its vigour, though $ereft of its joy; and
death no nearer to her frame, for being called upon by
her wi&s;hes.</P>
<P>In the heavine&s;s of di&s;appointment, &startq;I have lived,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;too long, and yet I cannot die! I am be|come

Any, every period appeared to her pre|ferable,
and in the de&s;peration of her heart, &s;he de|termined
in&s;tantly to pur&s;ue her Mother to Belfont;
and there, by the gentle interece&s;&s;i$n of Eugenia, to
obtain her pardon, or, which &s;he thought immediately
would follow its refu&s;al, to &s;ink to death at her feet.</P>
<P>Relieved from the inten&s;ene&s;s of her agony by this
plan, and ever eager to pur&s;ue the fir&s;t idea that aro&s;e,

Margland would accompany her to Belfont; whence,

The chai&s;e was accorded promptly by Mrs. Ber|linton,

Camilla whether or not &s;he &s;hould return; but Mi&s;s
Margland though burning with curio&s;ity to &s;ee Eu|genia
as Mrs. Bellamy, would not quit town, from
continual expectation, of &s;ome news of Indiana.</P>

death, Camilla &s;et off for Belfont.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XXVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Rever&s;e of a Ma&s;k.</HEAD>
<P>THE plan of Camilla was to &s;top within twenty
yards of the hou&s;e of Bellamy, and then &s;end for
Molly Mill. But till &s;he gave this direction to the
driver, &s;he was not aware of the inconvenience of
being without a &s;ervant, which had not previou&s;ly
occurred either to Mrs. Berlinton or her&s;elf. The
man could not leave his hor&s;es, and &s;he was com|pelled
to let him draw up to the gate. There, when
he rang at a bell, her terror, le&s;t &s;he &s;hould &s;uddenly
encounter Mrs. Tyrold, made her bid him open the
chai&s;e door, that &s;he might get out and walk on,
before he enquired for Molly. But, in &s;tepping
from the carriage, &s;he di&s;cerned, over a paling at
&s;ome di&s;tance, Eugenia her&s;elf, alone, &s;lowly walk|ing,
and her head turned another way.</P>
<P>Every per&s;onal, and even every filial idea, was buried
in&s;tantly in this &s;ight. The di&s;a&s;trous &s;tate of this
beloved and unhappy &s;i&s;ter, and her own peculiar
knowledge of the worthle&s;s character of the wretch
who had betrayed her into his &s;nares, penetrated her
with an angui&s;h that took thought from all el&s;e;
and darting through the great gate, and thence
through a &s;maller one, which opened to the &s;pot
<PB N="265" REF="92">
where &s;he &s;aw her walking, &s;he flew to her in a
&s;peechle&s;s tran&s;port of &s;orrow, folded her in her arms,
and &s;obbed upon her &s;houlder.</P>
<P>Starting, &s;haking, amazed, Eugenia looked at
her; &startq;Good Heaven!&endq; &s;he exclaimed, &startq;is it my
Si&s;ter!&mdash;Is it Camilla?&mdash;Do I, indeed, &s;ee one &s;o
dear to me?&endq; And, too weak to &s;u&s;tain her&s;elf, &s;he
&s;unk, though not fainting, upon the turf.</P>
<P>Camilla could not articulate a &s;yllable. The hor|ror
&s;he had conceived again&s;t Bellamy chilled all at|tempt
at con&s;olation, and her own mi&s;ery which,
the preceding moment, &s;eemed to be cru&s;hing the
&s;prings of life, vani&s;hed in the agonized affection
with which &s;he felt the misfortunes of her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Eugenia &s;oon recovered, and ri&s;ing, and holding
her by the hand, yet &s;eeming to refu&s;e her&s;elf the emo|tion
of returning her embraces, &s;aid, with a faint
effort to &s;mile; &startq;You have &s;urpri&s;ed me, indeed,
my dear Camilla, and convicted me to my&s;elf of my
vain philo&s;ophy. I had thought I &s;hould never more
be moved thus again. But I &s;ee now, the affecti|ons
are not &s;o &s;peedily to be all vanqui&s;hed.&endq;</P>
<P>The melancholy conveyed by this idea of believed
apathy, in a young creature &s;o innocent, and but
ju&s;t dawning into life, &s;till beyond &s;peech, and nearly
beyond &s;ufferance, affected Camilla, who hanging over
her, &s;ighed out: &startq;My deare&s;t!&mdash;deare&s;t Eu|genia!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what is it has brought to me this unex|pected,
but loved &s;ight? Does Mr. Bellamy know
you are here?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, &s;huddering at his name.</P>
<P>Eugenia looked pen&s;ive, looked di&s;tre&s;&s;ed; and
ca&s;ting down her eyes and he&s;itating, with a deep
&s;igh &s;aid: &startq;I,&mdash;I have not the trinkets for my
dear &s;i&s;ter&mdash;Mr. Bellamy&mdash;&endq; &s;he &s;topt.</P>
<P>Called to her &s;ad &s;elf by this &s;hock, of which &s;he
&s;trove to repre&s;s the emotion, Camilla recollected her
<PB N="266" REF="93">
own &startq;almo&s;t blunted purpo&s;e<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Hamlet.</NOTE>,&endq; and fearfully a&s;ked
if their Mother were yet at Belfont.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, no,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, cla&s;ping her hands and
leaning her head upon her &s;i&s;ter's neck: &startq;She is
gone!&mdash;The day before ye&s;terday &s;he was with me,
&mdash;with me only for one hour!&mdash;yet to pa&s;s with her
&s;uch another, I think, my dear Camilla, would &s;oon
lead me where I might learn a better philo&s;ophy than
that I &s;o vainly thought I had already acquired
here!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;truck with awe, ventured not even at
an enquiry; and they both, for &s;ome little time,
walked on in &s;ilence.</P>
<P>&startq;Did &s;he name to you,&endq; at length, in broken ac|cents,
&s;he a&s;ked, &startq;did &s;he name to you, my Euge|nia,
&mdash;the poor, bani&s;hed&mdash;Camilla?&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Bani&s;hed? No. How bani&s;hed?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She did not mention me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No. She came to me but upon one &s;ubject.
She failed in her purpo&s;e,&mdash;and left me.&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;igh that was nearly a groan fini&s;hed this &s;hort
little &s;peech.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Heaven! my Eugenia,&endq; cried Camilla,
now in agony unre&s;i&s;ted, &startq;tell me then, what pa&s;&s;|ed!
what new di&s;appointment had my unhappy Mo|ther
to &s;u&s;tain? And how, and by what cruel fata|lity,
has it fallen to your lot&mdash;even to yours&mdash;
to &s;uffer her wi&s;hes to fail?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You know nothing, then,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, after
a pau&s;e, &startq;of her view&mdash;her errand hither?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing; but that to &s;ee you brought her not
only hither, but to England.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ble&s;&s;ed may &s;he be!&endq; cried Eugenia, fervently,
&startq;and rewarded where rewards are ju&s;t, and are per|manent!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla zealou&s;ly joined in the prayer, yet be&s;ought
to know if &s;he might not be informed of the view
to which &s;he alluded?</P>
<P><PB N="267" REF="94">
&startq;We mu&s;t go then,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, &startq;into the
hou&s;e; my poor frame is yet feebler than my mind,
and I cannot &s;upport it unaided while I make &s;uch a
relation.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, affrighted, now gave up her reque&s;t; but
the generous Eugenia would not leave her in &s;u&s;pen&s;e.
They went, therefore, to a parlour, where, &s;hutting
the doors and windows, &s;he &s;aid, &startq;I mu&s;t be con|ci&s;e,
for both our &s;akes; and when you under&s;tand
me, we mu&s;t talk in&s;tantly of other things.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla could give only a tacit promi&s;e; but her
air &s;hewed &s;he would hold it &s;acred as any bond.</P>
<P>&startq;The idea which brought over this ine&s;timable
Parent, and which brought her, at a moment when
&s;he knew me to be alone, to this &s;ad hou&s;e, the&s;e &s;ad
arms&mdash;Camilla! how &s;hall I &s;peak it? It was to
exonerate me from my vows, as forced! to annul all
my engagements as compul&s;atory! and to re&s;tore me
again&mdash;O, Camilla! Camilla! to my Parents, my
Si&s;ters, my Uncle, my dearly-loved Cleves!&endq;</P>
<P>She ga&s;ped almo&s;t convul&s;ively; yet though Ca|milla
now even conjured her to &s;ay no more, went on:
&startq;A propo&s;al &s;uch as this, pre&s;&s;ed upon me by one
who&s;e probity and honour hold all calamity at
nought, if oppo&s;ed to the mo&s;t minute deviation
from right&mdash;a propo&s;al &s;uch as this&mdash;ah! let me
not go back to the one terrible half in&s;tant of demur!
It was heart-rending, it was killing! I thought my|&s;elf
again in the bo&s;om of my loved family!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;And is it &s;o utterly impo&s;&s;ible? And can it not
yet be effected?&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;No, my dear Si&s;ter, no! The horrible &s;cenes I
mu&s;t go through in a public trial for &s;uch a purpo&s;e
&mdash;the &s;olemn vows I mu&s;t &s;et a&s;ide, the re-iterated
promi&s;es I mu&s;t break&punc;&mdash;no, my dear Si&s;ter, no!
&mdash;And now, we will &s;peak of this no more.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla knew too well her firmne&s;s, her enthu&s;ia&s;m
to perform whatever &s;he conceived to be her duty,
to enter into any conte&s;t. Yet to &s;ee her thus &s;elf
devoted, where even her upright Mother, and pious
<PB N="268" REF="95">
Father, tho&s;e patterns of re&s;ignation to every
heaven-inflicted &s;orrow, thought her ties were
repealed by the very villainy which had form|ed
them, &s;eemed more melancholy, and yet
harder for &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, than her fir&s;t &s;eizure by the
worthle&s;s Bellamy.</P>
<P>&startq;And how bore my poor Mother&mdash;my
poor unfortunate Mother! de&s;tined thus to woes
of every &s;ort, though from children who adore
her!&mdash;how bore &s;he the deprivation of a hope that
had brought her &s;o far?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Like her&s;elf! nobly! when once it was de|cided,
and &s;he &s;aw that though, upon certain
avowals, the law might revoke my plighted faith,
it could not abrogate the &s;cruples of my con&s;ci|ence.
She thinks them over&s;trained, but &s;he
knows them to be &s;incere, and permitted them,
therefore, to &s;ilence her. Unfit to be &s;een by any
others, &s;he hurried then away. And then, Camilla,
began my trial! Indeed I thought, when &s;he had
left me,&mdash;when my arms no more embraced
her honoured knees, and neither her ble&s;&s;ings, nor
her &s;orrows &s;oothed or wounded my ears, I thought
I might defy all evil to a&s;&s;ault, all woe to afflict
me ever again! that my eyes were exhau&s;ted of
every tear, and my heart was emptied of all power
of future feeling. I &s;eemed &s;uddenly quite harden|ed;&mdash;transformed
I thought to &s;tone, as &s;en&s;ele&s;s,
as immoveable, and as cold!&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;en&s;ations of Camilla were all &s;uch as &s;he
dur&s;t not utter; but Eugenia, a&s;&s;uming &s;ome com|po&s;ure;
added, &startq;Of this and of me now enough&mdash;
&s;peak, my dear Si&s;ter, of your&s;elf. How have you
been enabled to come hither? And what could you
mean by &s;aying you were bani&s;hed?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas my deare&s;t Eugenia, if my unhappy &s;itu|ation
is unknown to you, why &s;hould I agitate
you with new pain? my Mother, I find, &s;pared
you; and not only you, but me&mdash;though I have
wrung her heart, tortured it by a &s;ight never to
be obliterated from her memory&mdash;&s;he would not
<PB N="269" REF="96">
rob me of my beloved &s;i&s;ter's regard; nor even
name me, le&s;t the altered tone of her voice &s;hould
make you &s;ay, Of what Camilla does my Mother
&s;peak?&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, with earne&s;t wonder, begged an ex|planation;
but when Camilla found her wholly
uninformed of the hi&s;tory of their Father's con|finement,
&s;he recoiled from giving her &s;uch a
&s;hock: yet having gone too far entirely to recede,
&s;he re&s;ted the di&s;plea&s;ure of their Mother upon the
debts, and the dealings with a u&s;urer; both &s;uffi|ciently
repugnant to the &s;trictne&s;s and noblene&s;s
of Mrs Tyrold, to &s;eem ample ju&s;tification of her
di&s;plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>Eugenia entered into the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of her &s;i&s;ter,
as if exempt her&s;elf from all &s;uffering: and Ca|milla,
thus commi&s;erating and commi&s;erated, knew
not how to tear her&s;elf away; for though Eugenia
pre&s;&s;ed not her &s;tay, &s;he turned pale, when a door
opened, a clock &s;truck, or any thing &s;eemed to
progno&s;ticate a &s;eparation; and looked as if to part
with her were death.</P>
<P>At length, however, the latene&s;s of the day
forced more of re&s;olution. But when Camilla then
rang to give orders for the carriage, the &s;ootman
&s;aid it been gone more than two hours. The po&s;|tillion,
being left without any directions, thought
it convenient to &s;uppo&s;e he was done with; and
knowing Camilla had no authoriy, and his lady
no inclination to chide him, had given in her
little packet and driven off, without enquiry.</P>
<P>Far from repining at this mixture of imperti|nence
and carele&s;&s;ne&s;s, Camilla would have rejoiced
in an accident that &s;eemed to invite her &s;tay, had
not her &s;i&s;ter &s;eemed more &s;tartled than plea&s;ed by
it. She begged, therefore, that a po&s;t chai&s;e might
be ordered; and Molly Mill, the only &s;ervant to
whom the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e appeared willing to
&s;peak, received the commi&s;&s;ion. At &s;ight of Ca|milla,
Molly had cried bitterly, and beginning
&startq;O Mi&s;s!&mdash;&endq; &s;eemed entering into &s;ome lamen|tation
<PB N="270" REF="97">
and detail; but Eugenia, checking her,
half whi&s;pered: &startq;Good Molly, remember what
you promi&s;ed!&endq;</P>
<P>When Molly came back, &s;he &s;aid that there
were no hor&s;es at Belfont, and would be none till
the next morning.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters involuntarily congratulated one ano|ther
upon this accident, though they reciprocated
a &s;igh, that to nece&s;&s;ity alone they &s;hould owe
their lengthened intercour&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;But, my dear mi&s;tre&s;s,&endq; cried Molly, &startq;there's
a lad that I know very well, for I always &s;ee him
when I go of an errand, that's going to Sali&s;bury;
and he &s;ays he mu&s;t go through Etherington, and
if you've any thing you want to &s;end he'll take it
for you; and he can bring any thing back, for he
&s;hall be here again to-morrow, for he goes po&s;t.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia, &s;ending away Molly, &s;aid, &startq;Why
&s;hould you not &s;eize &s;uch an opportunity to addre&s;s
a few a lines to our dear mother? I may then have
the &s;atisfaction to &s;ee her an&s;wer: and if,&mdash;as
I cannot doubt, &s;he tells you to return home with
Mi&s;s Margland;&mdash;for &s;he will not, I am &s;ure, let
you travel about alone;&mdash;what a relief will it be
to me to know the di&s;tre&s;&s;es of my beloved &s;i&s;ter
are terminated! I &s;hall paint your meeting in my
&startq;mind's eye,&endq; &s;ee you again re&s;tored to the &s;un|&s;hine
of her fondne&s;s, and while away my &s;olitary
languor with reveries far more &s;oothing than any
that I have yet experienced at Belfont.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla embraced her generous Si&s;ter; and
always readie&s;t for what was &s;peedie&s;t, wrote the&s;e
lines, directed</P>

</LETTER>
<P>Could the two &s;i&s;ters, even in this melancholy
&s;tate, have continued together, they felt that yet
from tender &s;ympathy, con&s;olation might revi&s;it
their bo&s;oms. The day clo&s;ed in; but they could
not bear to part; and though, from hour to hour,
they pronounced an adieu, they &s;till &s;at on, talked
on, and found a balm in their re&s;tored intercour&s;e,
&s;o healing and &s;o &s;weet, that the &s;un, though they
hailed not its beams, ro&s;e while they were yet
repeating Good Night!</P>
<P>They then thought it too late to retire, mutu|ally
agreeing with how much greater facility they
might recover their lo&s;t re&s;t, than an opportunity
&s;uch as this for undi&s;turbed conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>Every minute of this endearing commerce made
&s;eparation &s;eem harder; and the an&s;wer for which
they waited from Etherington, anxiou&s;ly and fear|fully
as it was expected, &s;o whiled away the
minutes, that it was noon, and no chai&s;e had
been ordered, when they heard one driving up to
the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>Alarmed, they li&s;tened to know what it por|tended.
&startq;Mr. Bellamy,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, in a low
voice, &startq;&s;carce ever comes home at this hour.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Can it be my Mother her&s;elf? cried Camilla.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, however, Eugenia looked pale,
&startq;'Tis his &s;tep!&endq; &s;he whi&s;pered; and pre&s;ently
Bellamy opened the door.</P>
<P>Obliged to acknowledge his entrance, Camilla
aro&s;e; but her parched lips and clammy mouth
made her feel as if his &s;ight had given her a fever,
and &s;he attempted not to force any &s;peech.</P>
<P>He did not &s;eem &s;urpri&s;ed at &s;eeing her, a&s;ked
how &s;he did, rather cavalierly than civilly: rang
<PB N="272" REF="99">
the bell, and gave various orders; addre&s;&s;ed &s;carce
a word to his wi&s;e, and walked whi&s;tling about
the room.</P>
<P>A change &s;o gro&s;s and quick from the ob&s;equi|ous
Bellamy Camilla had hitherto &s;een, was be|yond
even her wor&s;t expectations, and &s;he con|ceived
as low an opinion of his under&s;tanding and
his manners, as of his morals.</P>
<P>Eugenia kept her eyes rivetted to the ground;
and though &s;he tried, from time to time, to &s;ay
&s;omething to them both, evidently required her
utmo&s;t fortitude to remain in the room.</P>
<P>At length; &startq;Mi&s;s Camilla,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;I &s;up|po&s;e
you know Mi&s;s Margland is gone?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Gone? whither?&mdash;how gone?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why home. That is to her home, as &s;he
thinks it, Cleves. She &s;et off this morning with
the light.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, a&s;toni&s;hed, was now called forth from
her taciturnity; &startq;What po&s;&s;ibly,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;can have induced this &s;udden journey? Has my
uncle &s;ent for her?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No; your uncle has nothing to do with it.
She had a letter la&s;t night from Mrs. Macder&s;ey,
with one enclo&s;ed for Sir Hugh, to beg pardon
and &s;o forth; and this morning &s;he &s;et off to
carry it.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was confounded. Why Mi&s;s Margland
had not, at lea&s;t, called at Belfont to enquire if
&s;he would proceed with her, was beyond all her
conjecture.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Soon after, Bellamy's &s;ervant came in with a
letter for Camilla, which had arrived after &s;he
left town, and was given to him by Mrs. Berlin|ton's
butler. She retired into the next room to
read it, where, to her great con&s;ternation, &s;he
found it was from Jacob, and had been written
the day of Mr. Tyrold's arre&s;t, though, as it was
&s;ent by a private hand, it had only now arrived.

the doctors had ordered for his &s;tomach. This
all the &s;ervants had taken &s;o to heart, that they

privately laid in, and not let his honour know

<P>So touching a mark of the fond gratitude of the
Cleves' &s;ervants to their kind ma&s;ter, mingled
tenderne&s;s, in defiance of all horror, in the tears
of Camilla; but her total inability to &s;atisfy the
ju&s;t claims of Jacob, &s;ince now her re&s;ource even
in Eugenia failed, with the grief of either defeating
his worthy project, or making it la&s;tingly hurtful
to him, was among&s;t the &s;evere&s;t &s;trokes which had
followed her ill advi&s;ed &s;chemes. To proclaim
&s;uch an additional debt, was a &s;hame from which
&s;he &s;hrunk; yet to fly immediately to Cleves, and
try to &s;oothe her oppre&s;&s;ed uncle, was an idea that
&s;till &s;eemed gifted with &s;ome power to &s;oothe her|&s;elf.

in wrong, however it might be checked,
in its progre&s;s, by a mingled love of right, and
a fear of ill con&s;equences.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah Edgar!&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;had I tru&s;ted you as
I ought, from the moment of your generous de|claration
&mdash;had my confidence been as firm in your
kindne&s;s as in your honour, what mi&s;ery had I
been &s;aved!&mdash;from this connection&mdash;from my
debts&mdash;from every wide-&s;preading mi&s;chief!&mdash;I
could then have erred no more, for I &s;hould have
thought but of your approvance!&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e regrets were, as u&s;ual, re&s;uming their
ab&s;orbing powers;&mdash;for all other evils &s;eemed fluc|tuating,
but here mi&s;ery was &s;tationary; when the
voice of Bellamy, &s;peaking har&s;hly to his unhappy
wife, and &s;ome words &s;he unavoidably caught, by
which &s;he found he was reque&s;ting that &s;he would
demand money of Sir Hugh, made her conclude
him not aware he was overheard, and force her|&s;elf
back to the parlour. But his inattention upon
her return was &s;o near rudene&s;s, that &s;he &s;oon felt
convinced Mrs. Berlinton had acquainted him with
her remon&s;trances and ill opinion: he &s;eemed in
guilty fear of letting her conver&s;e even a moment
with Eugenia; and pre&s;ently, though with an air
of pretended unconcern, &s;aid: &startq;You have no
commands for the chai&s;e I came in, Mi&s;s Camilla?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, Sir,&mdash;What chai&s;e?&mdash;Why?&mdash;&endq;
She &s;tammered.</P>
<P>&startq;It's difficult &s;ometimes to get one at this
place; and the&s;e hor&s;es are very fre&s;h. I bid them
&s;tay till they a&s;ked you.&endq;</P>
<P>This was &s;o palpable a hint for her to depart,
that &s;he could but not an&s;wer &s;he would make u&s;e
of it, when &s;he had taken leave of her &s;i&s;ter;
<PB N="275" REF="102">
whom &s;he now looked at with emotions near
de&s;pair at her fate, and with difficulty re&s;trained
even its mo&s;t unbridled expre&s;&s;ions. But Bellamy
kept clo&s;e, and no private conference could take
place. Eugenia merely &s;aid: &startq;Which way, my
dear &s;i&s;ter, &s;hall you go?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I&mdash;I am not, fixed&mdash;to&mdash;to Cleves, I
believe,&endq; an&s;wered &s;he, &s;carce knowing her&s;elf
what &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>&startq;I am very glad of it,&endq; &s;he replied, &startq;for the
&s;ake of my poor&mdash;&endq; &s;he found her voice faulter,
and did not pronounce &startq;uncle;&endq; but added, &startq;as
Mi&s;s Margland has already left London, I think
you right to go thither at once; it may abridge
many difficulties; and with po&s;t-hor&s;es, you may
be there before it is dark.&endq;</P>
<P>They then embraced tenderly, but parted with|out
any further &s;peech, and &s;he &s;et off rather me|chanically
than de&s;ignedly for Cleves.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">A new View of an old Man&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA, for &s;ome time, be&s;towed no thought
upon what &s;he was doing, nor whither &s;he was going.
A &s;cene &s;o dreadful as that &s;he now quitted, and a
character of &s;uch utter unworthine&s;s as that with
which her &s;i&s;ter for life was tied, ab&s;orbed her &s;acul|ties,
and nearly broke her heart.</P>
<P>When &s;he &s;topt, however, at Bag&s;hot, for fre&s;h
hor&s;es, the obligation of giving directions to others,
made her think of her&s;elf; and, bewildered with un|certainty
whether the &s;tep &s;he took were right or
wrong, &s;he regretted &s;he had not, at lea&s;t, de&s;ired to
&s;tay till the an&s;wer arrived from Etherington. Yet
her journey had the &s;anction of Eugenia's concur|rence;
and Eugenia &s;eemed to her oracular.</P>
<P><PB N="276" REF="103">
When &s;he came upon the cro&s;s road leading from
Winche&s;ter to Cleves, and felt her quick approach to
the &s;pot &s;o loved yet dreaded, the hor&s;es &s;eemed to
her to fly. Twenty times &s;he called out to the driver
not to hurry; who as often a&s;&s;ured her the bad roads
prevented any ha&s;te; &s;he wanted to form &s;ome appro|priate
plan and &s;peech for every emergence; but &s;he
could &s;ugge&s;t none for any. She was now at the feet
of her Mother, now ki&s;&s;ing the hands of her Father,
now embraced again by her fond uncle;&mdash;and now
rejected by them all. But while her fancy was at
work alternately to &s;oothe and to torture her, the park
lodge met her eyes, with &s;till no re&s;olution taken.</P>
<P>Vehemently &s;he &s;topt the chai&s;e. To drive in
through the park would call a general attention, and
&s;he wi&s;hed, ere her arrival were announced, to con|&s;ult
alone with Lavinia. She re&s;olved, therefore, to
get out of the carriage, and run by a private path, to
a &s;mall door at the back of the hou&s;e, whence &s;he
could glide to the chamber commonly appropriated to
her &s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>She told the po&s;tilion to wait, and alighting, walk|ed
quick and fearfully towards the lodge.</P>
<P>She pa&s;&s;ed through the park-gate for foot-pa&s;&s;engers
without notice from the porter. It was twilight. She
&s;aw no one; and rejoiced in the general vacancy.
Trembling, but with celerity, &s;he &startq;<HI>&s;kimmed,</HI>&endq; like
her celebrated name-&s;ake, the turf; and annoyed only
by the &s;hadows of the trees, which all, as fir&s;t they
caught her eye, &s;eemed the precur&s;ors of the approach
of Mrs. Tyrold, &s;peedily reached the man&s;ion: but
when &s;he came to the little door by which &s;he meant
to enter, &s;he found it fa&s;tened.</P>
<P>To the front door &s;he dur&s;t not go, from the nu|merous
chances by which &s;he might &s;urpri&s;e &s;ome of
the family in the hall: and to pre&s;ent her&s;elf at the
&s;ervant's gate would have an appearance degrading
and clande&s;tine.</P>
<P>She recollected, at la&s;t, the &s;a&s;h-door of a bow-window
belonging to a room that was never occupied
but in &s;ummer. Thither &s;he went, and knowing the
<PB N="277" REF="104">
&s;pring by which it could be opened on the out-&s;ide,
let her&s;elf into the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>With &s;teps not to be heard, and &s;carce breathing,
&s;he got thence into a $ong &s;tone pa&s;&s;age, whence &s;he
meant to mount the back &s;tairs.</P>
<P>She was relieved by not meeting any one in the way,
though &s;urpri&s;ed to hear no foot-&s;teps about the hou&s;e,
and no voices from any of the apartments.</P>
<P>Cautiou&s;ly &s;he went on, looking round at every
&s;tep, to avoid any &s;udden encounter; but when &s;he
came to the bed-chamber gallery, &s;he &s;aw that the door
of the room of Sir Hugh, by which &s;he mu&s;t nece&s;|&s;arily
pa&s;s, was wide open.</P>
<P>It was po&s;&s;ible he might be in it: &s;he had not cou|rage
to pa&s;s; her &s;ight, thus unprepared, after &s;o
many heavy evils, might be too affecting for his weak
frame. She turned &s;hort round, and entered a large
apartment at the head of the &s;tairs, called the
billiard-room, where &s;he re&s;olved to wait and watch
ere &s;he ventured any further.</P>
<P>Its a&s;pect was to the front of the hou&s;e: &s;he &s;tole
gently to a window, whence &s;he thought the melan|choly
of her own mind pervaded the park. None of
her uncle's hor&s;es were in &s;ight; no one was pa&s;&s;ing
to and fro; and &s;he looked vainly even for the hou&s;e|dog
who ordinarily patrolled before the man&s;ion.</P>
<P>She ventured to bend forwarder, to take a view of
the &s;ide wings; the&s;e, however, pre&s;ented not any
&s;ight more exhilirating nor more animated. Nothing
was in motion, no one was vi&s;ible, not even a fire
blazed chearfulne&s;s.</P>
<P>She next &s;trove to catch a glance of the windows
belonging to the chamber of Eugenia; but her &s;igh,
though &s;ad, was without &s;urpri&s;e to &s;ee their &s;hutters
clo&s;ed. Tho&s;e of Indiana were &s;hut al&s;o. &startq;How
mournfully,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;is all changed! what of
virtues are gone with Eugenia! what of beauty with
Indiana! the one &s;o con&s;tantly intere&s;ting! the other
locking always &s;o lovely!&endq;</P>
<P>But deeper &s;till was her &s;igh, &s;ince mingled with
&s;elf-reproach, to perceive her own chamber al&s;o &s;hut
<PB N="278" REF="105">
up. &startq;Alas!&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;my poor uncle con&s;iders
us all as dead to him!&endq; She dur&s;t not lean &s;ufficiently
forward to examine the drawing-room, in which &s;he
concluded the family a&s;&s;embled; but &s;he ob&s;erved,
with wonder, that even the library was not open,
though it was &s;till too light for candles; and Dr.
Orkborne, who u&s;ually &s;at there, from the forgetful|ne&s;s
of application, was the la&s;t to demand them.</P>
<P>The fear of di&s;covery was now combated by an
anxiety to &s;ee &s;ome one&mdash;any one,&mdash;and &s;he returned
to the pa&s;&s;age. All there was &s;till quiet, and &s;he
hazarded gliding pa&s;t the open door, though without
daring to look into the room; but when &s;he came to
the chamber of Lavinia, which &s;he &s;oftly entered, all
was dark, and it was evidently not in pre&s;ent u&s;e.</P>
<P>This was truly di&s;tre&s;sful. She concluded her
&s;i&s;ter was returned to Etherington, and knew not to
whom to apply for coun&s;el or mediation. She no
longer, however, feared meeting her parents, who
certainly had not made her &s;i&s;ter quit Cleves without
them&s;elves; and, after a little he&s;itation, relying
upon the ever &s;ure lenity of her uncle, &s;he determin|ed
to ca&s;t her&s;elf upon his kindne&s;s: but fir&s;t to &s;end
in a &s;hort note, to avoid giving him any &s;urpri&s;e.</P>
<P>She returned down the gallery, meaning to apply
for pen and ink to the fir&s;t per&s;on &s;he could find: &s;he
could only, &s;he knew, meet with a friend; unle&s;s,
by ill fortune, &s;he &s;hould encounter Mi&s;s Margland, the
way to who&s;e apartment &s;he &s;edulou&s;ly &s;hunned.</P>
<P>No longer, however, quite &s;o cautious, &s;he &s;topt
near the chamber of Sir Hugh, and convinced by the
&s;tillne&s;s it was empty, could not re&s;i&s;t &s;tepping into
the apartment.</P>
<P>It looked de&s;poiled and for&s;aken. Nothing was in
its wonted order; his favourite guns hung not over the
chimney-piece; the corners of the room were emptied
of his &s;ticks; his great chair was in a new place; no
cu&s;hions for his dogs were near the fire; the bed&s;tead
was naked.</P>
<P>She now felt petrified; &s;he &s;unk on the floor, to
ejaculate a prayer for his &s;afety; but knew not how to
<PB N="279" REF="106">
ri&s;e again, for terror; nor which way next to turn,
nor what even to conjecture.</P>
<P>Thus &s;he remained, till &s;u&s;pen&s;e grew wor&s;e than
certainty, and forced her&s;elf from the room to &s;eek
&s;ome explanation. It was po&s;&s;ible the whole family
re&s;idence might be changed to the back front of the
hou&s;e. She defcended the &s;tairs with almo&s;t equal ap|prehen&s;ion
of meeting any one or &s;eeing no one. The
&s;tone pa&s;&s;age was now nearly dark. It was always
the fir&s;t part of the hou&s;e that was lighted, as its
windows were &s;mall and high: but no preparations
were now making for that purpo&s;e. She went to the
hou&s;e-keeper's room, which was at the foot of the
&s;tairs &s;he had de&s;cended. The door was &s;hut, and
&s;he could not open it. She tried repeatedly, but
vainly, to be heard by &s;oft taps and whi&s;perings; no
one an&s;wered.</P>
<P>Amazed, confounded, &s;he turned &s;lowly another
way; not a foul was in &s;ight, not a &s;ound within
hearing. Every thing looked de&s;olate, all the family
&s;eemed to be vani&s;hed.</P>
<P>In&s;en&s;ibly, yet irre&s;i&s;tibly, &s;he now moved on to|wards
the drawing-room. The door was &s;hut. She
he&s;itated whether or not to attempt it. She li&s;tened.
She hoped to catch the voice of her uncle: but all
was inviolably &s;till.</P>
<P>This was the only place of a&s;&s;embling in the eve|ning;
but her uncle might have dropt a&s;leep, and
&s;he would not hazard &s;tartling him with her pre&s;ence.
She would &s;ooner go to the hall at once, and be an|nounced
in the common way by a &s;ervant.</P>
<P>But what was her a&s;toni&s;hment in coming to the
hall, to find neither &s;ervant, light nor fire? and the
marble pavement covered with trunks, packing mats,
&s;traw, ropes, and boxes? Terrified and a&s;toni&s;hed,
&s;he thought her&s;elf walking in her &s;leep. She could
combine no ideas, either good or bad, to account for
&s;uch a &s;cene, and &s;he looked at it bewildered and
incredulous.</P>
<P>After a long he&s;itation, &s;pent in wonder rather than
thought, &s;he at length determined to enter the break|fa&s;t
<PB N="280" REF="107">
parlour, and ring the bell: when the di&s;tant
&s;ound of a carriage that was ju&s;t entering the park,
made her &s;hut her&s;elf into the room, ha&s;tily, but
&s;ilently.</P>
<P>It advanced rapidly; &s;he trembled; it was &s;urely,
&s;he thought, her Mother.</P>
<P>When it drove up to the portico, and &s;he heard the
hou&s;e-bell ring, &s;he in&s;tinctively barred her door; but
finding no one approach to the call, while the bell was
impatiently re-rung, her &s;trong emotions of expecta|tion
were taking her again into the hall: but as her
hand was upon the lock of the door, a light glimmer|ed
through the key hole. She heard &s;ome $$ep ad|vancing,
and precipitately drew back.</P>
<P>The hall-door was now opened, and a man en|quired
for a young lady ju&s;t come from Alresford.</P>
<P>&startq;There's no young lady here at all,&endq; was the an|&s;wer,
in the voice of Jacob.</P>
<P>Finding it only her own driver, &s;he ventured out;
crying &startq;O Jacob! where is my dear uncle?&endq;</P>
<P>Jacob was, at fir&s;t, incapable of all an&s;wer, through
&s;urpri&s;e at her &s;trange appearance; but then &s;aid, &startq;O
Mi&s;s Camilla! you'll go nigh to break your good
heart when you knows it all! But how, you've got
into the hou&s;e is what I can't gue&s;s; but I wi&s;h, for
my poor ma&s;ter's &s;ake, it had been before now!&endq;</P>
<P>Horror crept through every vein of Camilla, in the
explanation &s;he awaited of this fearful my&s;tery. She
motioned to the driver to &s;tay, returned back to the
parlour, and beckoned, for &s;he could not &s;peak, to
Jacob to follow her.</P>
<P>When he came, and, &s;hutting the door, was be|ginning
a diffu&s;e lamentation, eagerne&s;s to avert
lengthened &s;u&s;pence recovered her voice, and &s;h$ pa&s;|&s;ionately
exclaimed: &startq;Jacob! in two words, where
is my uncle?&mdash;Is he well?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, yes, Mi&s;s Camilla, con&s;idering&mdash;&endq; he
began; but Camilla, who&s;e fears had been fatal, in|terrupted
him with f$rvent thank&s;giving, till &s;he was
called back from joy by the following words:</P>
<P><PB N="481" REF="108">
&startq;He's gone away Mi&s;s Camilla! gone Lord
knows where! given up all his grand hou&s;e-keep|ing,
turned off almo&s;t all his poor &s;ervants, left
this fine place, to have it let to whoever will hire
it, and is going to live, he &s;ays, in &s;ome poor little
lodging, till he can &s;crape together wherewithal to
pay off every thing for your papa.&endq;</P>
<P>A thunder-bolt that had in&s;tantly de&s;troyed her,
would gratefully have been received, in preference
to this &s;peech, by Camilla, who, ca&s;ting up her
hands and eyes, exclaimed: &startq;Then am I the mo&s;t
dete&s;table, as well as the mo&s;t wretched of human
beings! My Father I have impri&s;oned!&mdash;my Un|cle
I have turned from his hou&s;e and home! and
for thee, O my Mother!&mdash;this is the reception I
have prepared!&endq;</P>
<P>Jacob tried to con&s;ole her; but his account was
only added torture.</P>
<P>The very in&s;tant he told her, that his ma&s;ter
had received the news of the arre&s;t of Mr. Tyrold,
he determined upon this violent plan; and though
the &s;o &s;peedy relea&s;e, through the genero&s;ity of
Mr. We&s;twyn, had exceedingly calmed his fir&s;t
emotions, he would not change his purpo&s;e, and
prote&s;ted he would never indulge him&s;elf in peace
nor comfort more, till he had cleared off their
joint debts; of which he attributed the whole fault
to him&s;elf, from having lived up to the very verge
of his yearly income, when he ought, he &s;aid, con|&s;idering
there were &s;o many young people, to have
always kept a few odd &s;ums at hand for accidents.
&startq;We all did what we could,&endq; continued Jacob,
&startq;to put him off from &s;uch a thing, but all to no
purpo&s;e; but if you'd been here, Mi&s;s Camilla,
you'd have done more with him than all of us put
together: but he called Mi&s;s Lavinia and all of us
up to him, and &s;aid to us, I won't have nobody tell
this to my poor little girl, meaning you, Mi&s;s Ca|milla,
till l've got &s;omewhere &s;ettled and comfort|able;
becau&s;e of her kind heart, &s;ays he.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="282" REF="109">
Tenderne&s;s &s;o partial, at &s;o &s;uffering an in&s;tant,
almo&s;t killed Camilla, &startq;O Jacob,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;where is now my dear generous uncle? I will
follow him in this chai&s;e (ru&s;hing out as &s;he &s;poke)
I will be his &s;ervant, his nur&s;e, and attend him
from morning to night!&endq;</P>
<P>She hurried into the carriage as &s;he &s;poke; and
bade him give directions to the po&s;tilion. But
when &s;he heard he was, at pre&s;ent, only at Ether|ington,
whence he was &s;eeking a new abode, her
head drooped, and &s;he bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>Jacob remained, he &s;aid, alone, to take care
of all the things&punc; and to &s;hew the place to &s;uch as
might come.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland had been at the hou&s;e about
three hours ago; and had met Sir Hugh, who had
come over, to give directions about what he would
have packed up; and he had read a letter from
Mi&s;s Indy that was, and had forgiven her; but he
was &s;ore vexed Mi&s;s Margland had come without
Mi&s;s Camilla; only &s;he &s;aid Mi&s;s Camilla was at
Mrs. Bellamy's, and &s;he did not call, becau&s;e &s;he
thought it would be better to go back again, and
&s;ee more about Mi&s;s Indy, and &s;o bring Mi&s;s Ca|milla
next time; &s;o &s;he wheedled his ma&s;ter to
&s;pare the chai&s;e again, and let her go off directly
to &s;ettle every thing to Mi&s;s Indy's mind.</P>
<P>Camilla now repented &s;he had not returned to
Mrs. Berlinton's, there, notwith&s;tanding all ob|jections,
to have waited her recall; &s;ince there her
parents &s;till believed her, and thence, under the
protection of Mi&s;s Margland, would in all proba|bility
&s;ummon her. To pre&s;ent her&s;elf, after this
barbarous aggravation of the calamities &s;he had
cau&s;ed, undemanded and unforgiven at Ethering|ton,
&s;he thought impo&s;&s;ible. She inquired if, by
pa&s;&s;ing the night, at Cleves, &s;he might have any
chance of &s;eeing her uncle the next day. Jacob
an&s;wered, no; but that Mr. Tyrold him&s;elf, with
a gentleman from Winche&s;ter, who thought of
<PB N="283" REF="110">
hiring the hou&s;e, were to be there early in the
morning to take a &s;urvey of the premi&s;es.</P>
<P>A meeting, thus circum&s;tanced, with her Fa|ther,
at a moment when he came upon &s;o direful a
bu&s;ine&s;s, as parting with a place of which &s;he had
her&s;elf occa&s;ioned the de&s;ertion, &s;eemed to her in|&s;upportable:
and &s;he re&s;olved to return immedi|ately
to Belfont, to &s;ee there if her an&s;wer from
Lavinia contained any new directions; and if not,
to again go to London, and await final commands;
without li&s;tening ever more to any hopes, projects,
or judgments of her own.</P>
<P>Be&s;eeching the worthy Jacob to pardon her non|payment,
with every kind a&s;&s;urance that her uncle
&s;hould know all his goodne&s;s, &s;he told the po&s;tillion
to take her to Belfont.</P>
<P>He could go no further, he &s;aid, and that but a
foot pace, than to Alresford. Jacob marvelled,
but ble&s;&s;ed her, and Camilla, ejaculating, &startq;Adieu,
dear happy Cleves!&endq; was driven out of the park.</P>

<P>She arrived at Alresford &s;o late, with the return

for the night.</P>
<P>Though too much occupied to weigh well her
lonely and improper &s;ituation, at an inn, and at
&s;uch hours, &s;he was too unea&s;y to go to bed, and
too mi&s;erable for &s;leep, She &s;at up, without at|tempting
to read, write, or employ her&s;elf, patrol|ing
her chamber in mournful rumination.</P>
<P>Nearly as &s;oon as it was light, &s;he proceeded,
and arrived at the hou&s;e of Bellamy as the &s;ervants
were opening the window-&s;hutters.</P>
<P>Fearfully &s;he a&s;ked who was at home; and hear|ing
only their mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;ent for Molly Mill, and
enquired for the an&s;wer from Etherington; but
the lad had not yet brought any. She begged her
to run to the inn, to know what had detained him;
and then, ordering the chai&s;e to wait, went to her
&s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Eugenia was gently rejoiced to &s;ee her, though
evidently with encrea&s;ed per&s;onal unhappine&s;s.
Camilla would fain have &s;pared her the hi&s;tory of
the de&s;ertion of Cleves; but it was an act that in
its own nature mu&s;t be public; and &s;he had no other
way to account for her &s;o &s;peedy return.</P>
<P>Eugenia heard it with the mo&s;t piercing affliction;
and, in the fulne&s;s of her heart, from the new blow,
acknowledged the rapacity of Bellamy, and the bar|barity
with which he now &s;crupled not to avow
the &s;ordid motives of his marriage; cruelly la|menting
the extreme &s;implicity with which &s;he had
been beguiled into a belief of the &s;incerity and
violence of his attachment. &startq;For my&s;elf, how|ever,&endq;
&s;he continued, &startq;I now cea&s;e to murmur.
How can misfortune, per&s;onally, cut me deeper?
But with pity, indeed, I think of a new victim!&endq;</P>
<P>She then put into her &s;i&s;ter's hand a written
paper &s;he had picked up the preceding evening in
<PB N="285" REF="112">
her room, and which, having no direction, and
being in the hand-writing of Mrs. Berlinton, &s;he
had thought was a former note to her&s;elf, acciden|tally
dropt: but the fir&s;t line undeceived her.</P>
<P>&startq;I yield, at length, O Bellamy, to the eloquence
of your friend&s;hip! on Friday,&mdash;at one o'clock,

<LETTER>
<P>Camilla, almo&s;t petrified, read the lines. She
knew better than her &s;i&s;ter the plan to which this
was the con&s;ent; which to have been given after
her repre&s;entations and urgency, appeared &s;o ut|terly
unju&s;tifiable, $hat, with equal grief and in|dignation,
&s;he gave up this unhappy friend as wil|fully
lo&s;t; and her whole heart recoiled from ever
again entering her doors</P>
<P>Retracing, neverthele&s;s, her many amiable qua|lities,
&s;he knew not how, without further effort, to
leave her to her threatening fate; and determined,
at all ri&s;ks, to put her into the hands of her bro|ther,
who&s;e timely knowledge of her danger might
re&s;cue her from public expo&s;ure. She wrote
therefore the following note:</P>

</LETTER>
<P>His addre&s;s, from frequently hearing it, was
familiar to her; &s;he went her&s;elf into the hall, to
give the billet to a footman for the po&s;t-office.
She would not let her &s;i&s;ter have any &s;hare in the
tran&s;action, le&s;t it &s;hould afterwards, by any acci|dent,
be known; though, to give force to her
warning, &s;he ri&s;ked without he&s;itation the initials
of her own name.</P>
<P>The repugnance, neverthele&s;s, to going again to
Mrs. Berlinton, pointed out no new refuge; and
&s;he waited, with added impatience, for the an&s;wer
from Etherington, in hopes &s;ome po&s;itive direction
might relieve her cruel perplexity.</P>
<P><PB N="286" REF="113">
The an&s;wer, however, came not, and yet great|er
grew her di&s;tre&s;s. Molly Mill brought word
that when the me&s;&s;enger, who was a po&s;t-boy,
$turned, he was immediately employed to driv$ $word$
chai&s;e to London. The people at the inn heard
him &s;ay &s;omething of wanting to go to 'Squire
Bellamy's with a letter; but he had not time. He
was to come back however at night.</P>
<P>To wait till he arrived &s;eemed now to them both
indi&s;pen&s;able; but while con&s;idering at what hour
to order the chai&s;e, they heard a hor&s;eman gallop
up to the hou&s;e-door. &startq;Is it po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould
already be Mr. Bellamy?&endq; cried Eugenia changing
colour.</P>
<P>His voice, loud and angry, pre&s;ently confirmed
the &s;ugge&s;tion. Eugenia, trembling, &s;aid &s;he would
let him know whom he would find; and went into
the next room, where, as he entered, he roughly
exclaimed, &startq;What have you done with what I
dropt out of my pocket-book?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;There, Sir,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, in the tone of firm|ne&s;s
given by the a&s;cendance of innocence over
guilt, &startq;There it is: but how you can reconcile
to your&s;elf the delu&s;ions by which you mu&s;t have
obtained it I know not. I hope only, for her
&s;ake, and for yours, &s;uch words will never more
meet my eyes.&endq;</P>
<P>He was beginning a violent an&s;wer in a rai&s;ed
voice, when Eugenia told him her &s;i&s;ter was in
the next room.</P>
<P>He then, in a lowered tone, &s;aid, &startq;I warrant,
you have &s;hewn her my letter?&endq;</P>
<P>The veracious Eugenia was incapable of &s;aying
no; and Bellamy, unable to re&s;train his rage,
though &s;mothering his voice, through his &s;hut
teeth, &s;aid, &startq;I &s;hall remember this, I promi&s;e you!&endq;
However, if &s;he dare ever &s;peak of it, you may
tell her, from me, I &s;hall lock you up upon bread
and water for the re&s;t of your life, and lay it at her
door. I have no great terms to keep with her
now. What does &s;he &s;ay about Cleves? and that
<PB N="287" REF="114">
fool your uncle, who is giving up his hou&s;e to
pay your father's debts? What has brought her
$word$ again?&endq;</P>
<P>&punc;She is returning to Gro&s;venor &s;quare, to Mi&s;s
Margland.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mi&s;s Margland? There's no Mi&s;s Margland
in Gro&s;venor-&s;quare; nor any body el&s;e, that
de&s;ires her company I can tell her. However, go,
and get her off, for I have other bu&s;ine&s;s for you.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Eugenia then, opening the door, found her
&s;i&s;ter almo&s;t demoli&s;hed with terror and di&s;may.
Silently, for &s;ome &s;econds, they &s;unk on the brea&s;t
of each other; horror clo&s;ing all &s;peech, drying
up even their tears.</P>
<P>&startq;You have no me&s;&s;age to give me!&endq; Camilla
at length whi&s;pered; &startq;I have perforce, heard all!
and I will go;&mdash;though whither&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;topt, with a look of di&s;tre&s;s &s;o poignant,
that Eugenia, bur&s;ting into tears, while tenderly
&s;he clung around her, &s;aid, &startq;My &s;i&s;ter! my Ca|milla!
from me&mdash;from my hou&s;e mu&s;t you wander
in &s;earch of an a&s;ylum!&endq;</P>
<P>Bellamy here called her back. Camilla entreat|ed
&s;he would inquire if he knew whither Mi&s;s
Margland was gone.</P>
<P>He now came in him&s;elf, bowing civilly, though
with con&s;traint, and told her that Mi&s;s Margland
was with Mrs. Macder&s;ey, at Macder&s;ey's own
lodgings; but that neither of them would any
more be invited to Gro&s;venor-&s;quare, after &s;uch
ill-treatment of Mrs. Berlinton's brother.</P>
<P>Can you, thought Camilla, talk of ill-treatment?
while, turning to her &s;i&s;ter, &s;he &s;aid, &startq;Which
way &s;hall I now travel?&endq;</P>
<P>Bellamy abruptly a&s;ked, if &s;he was forced to go
before dinner; but not with an air of inviting any
an&s;wer.</P>
<P>None could &s;he make; &s;he looked down, to &s;ave
her eyes the &s;ight of an object they abhorred, em|braced
Eugenia, who &s;eemed a picture of death;
and after &s;aying adieu, added, &startq;If I knew whither
<PB N="288" REF="115">
you thought I &s;hould go&mdash;that &s;hould be my
guide?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Home, my deare&s;t &s;i&s;ter!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Drive then,&endq; &s;he cried, hurrying to the chai&s;e,
&startq;to Etherington.&endq;</P>
<P>Bellamy advancing, &s;aid, with a &s;mile, &startq;I &s;ee
you are not much u&s;ed to travelling. Mi&s;s Camilla!&endq;
and gave the man a direction to Bag&s;hot.</P>
<P>She began, now, to feel nearly carele&s;s what
became of her; her &s;ituation &s;eemed equally de&s;o|late
and di&s;graceful, and in gloomy de&s;pondence,
when &s;he turned from the high road, and &s;topt at
a &s;mall inn, called the half-way-hou&s;e, about nine
miles from Etherington, &s;he re&s;olved to remain
there till &s;he received her expected an&s;wer; ardently
hoping, if it were not yielding and favourable,
the &s;pot upon which &s;he &s;hould read it, would be
that upon which her exi&s;tence would clo&s;e.</P>
<P>Alighting at the inn, which, from being upon
a cro&s;s road, had little cu&s;tom, and was &s;carce
more than a large cottage, &s;he entered a &s;mall par|lour,
di&s;charged her chai&s;e, and ordered a man
and hor&s;e to go immediately to Belfont.</P>
<P>Pre&s;ently two or three gentle tappings at the
door made her, though fearfully, &s;ay, &startq;Come in!&endq;
A little girl then, with ince&s;&s;ant low courte&s;ies,
appeared, and looking &s;milingly in her face, &s;aid,
&startq;Pray, ma'am a'n't you the Lady that was &s;o
good to us?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;When? my dear? what do you mean?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, that u&s;ed to give us cakes and nice
things, and gave 'em to Jen, and Bet, and Jack? and
that would not let my dad be took up?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now recollected the elde&s;t little Higden,
the wa&s;herwoman's niece, and kindly enquired
after her father, her aunt, and family.</P>
<P>&startq;O, they all does pure now. My dad's had no
more mi&s;haps, and he hopes, plea&s;e God, to get
on pretty well.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Sweet hearing!&endq; cried Camilla, &startq;all my pur|po&s;es
have not, then, been fru&s;trated!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="289" REF="116">
With added &s;atisfaction &s;he learned al&s;o that the
little girl had a good place, and a kind mi&s;tre&s;s.
She begged her to ha&s;ten the Belfont me&s;&s;enger, giving
her in charge a &s;hort note for Eugenia, with a reque&s;t
for the Etherington letter. She had &s;pent nothing in
London, &s;ave in &s;ome &s;mall remembrances to one or
two of Mrs. Berlinton's &s;ervants; and though her
chai&s;e-hire had now almo&s;t emptied her pur&s;e, &s;he
thought every expence preferable to either lengthening
her &s;u&s;pence, or her re&s;idence on the road.</P>
<P>In an&s;wer to the demand of what &s;he would be
plea&s;ed to have, &s;he then ordered tea. She had taken
no regular meal for two days; and for two nights had
not even been in bed. But the wretchedne&s;s of her
mind &s;eemed to render her invulnerable to fatigue.</P>
<P>The &s;haken &s;tate of her nerves warped all ju&s;t con|&s;ideration
of the impropriety of her pre&s;ent &s;ojourn.
Her judgment had no chance, where it had her feelings
to combat, and in the de&s;pondence of believing her|&s;elf
parentally rejected, &s;he was indifferent to appear|ances,
and de&s;perate upon all other events; nor was
&s;he brought to any recollection, till &s;he was informed
that the me&s;&s;enger, whom &s;he had concluded was half
way to Belfont, could not &s;et out till the next morn|ing:
this &s;mall and private inn not being able to fur|ni&s;n
a man and hor&s;e at &s;horter warning.</P>
<P>To pa&s;s a &s;econd night at an inn, &s;eemed, even in
the calculations of her own hara&s;&s;ed faculties, utterly
improper; and thus, driven to extremity, &s;he forced
her&s;elf to order a chai&s;e for home; though with a
repugnance to &s;o compul&s;atory a meeting, that made
her wi&s;h to be carried in it a corp&s;e.</P>
<P>The tardy prudence of the character naturally ra&s;h,
commonly arrives but to point repentance that it came
not before. The only pair of hor&s;es the little inn
afforded, were now out upon other duty, and would
not return till the next day.</P>
<P>Almo&s;t to her&s;elf incredible &s;eemed now her &s;itu|ation.
She was compelled to order a bed, and to go
up $tairs to a &s;mall chamber: but &s;he could not even
wi&s;h to take any re&s;t. &startq;I am an outca&s;t,&endq; &s;he cried,
<PB N="290" REF="117">
&startq;to my family;&endq; my Mother would <HI>rather not &s;ee$me;</HI>
my Father forbears to demand me; and he&mdash;dearer to
me than life!&mdash;by whom I was once cho&s;en, has for|gotten
me!&mdash;How may I &s;upport my heavy exi&s;tence?
and when will it end?</P>
<P>Overpowered, neverthele&s;s, by fatigue, in the
middle of the night, &s;he lay down in her cloaths:
but her &s;lumbers were &s;o broken by vi&s;ions of reproach,
conveyed through hideous forms, and in menaces the
mo&s;t terrific, that &s;he gladly got up; preferring certain
affliction to wild and &s;anta&s;tic horrors.</P>
<P>Nearly as &s;oon as it was light, &s;he rang for little
Peggy, who&s;e Southampton anecdotes had &s;ecured her
the utmo&s;t re&s;pect from the mi&s;tre&s;s of the inn, and
heard that the expre&s;s was &s;et off.</P>
<P>Dreadful and dreary, in &s;low and lingering mi&s;ery,
pa&s;&s;ed the long interval of his ab&s;ence,\though his
rapid manner of travelling made it &s;hort for the
ground he traver&s;ed. She had now, however, bought
&s;ufficient experience to be&s;peak a chai&s;e again&s;t his
return. The only employment in which &s;he could
engage her&s;elf, was conver&s;ing with Peggy Higden,
who, &s;he was glad to find, could not remember her
name well enough to make it known, through her
pronunciation.</P>
<P>From the window, at length, &s;he perceived a man
and hor&s;e gallop up to the hou&s;e. She darted forth,
exclaiming: &startq;Have you brought me any an&s;wer?&endq;
And &s;eizing the letter he held out, &s;aw the hand|writing
of Lavinia, and &s;hut her&s;elf into her room.</P>
<P>She opened it upon her knees, expecting to find
within &s;ome lines from her mother; none, however,
appeared, and &s;ad and mortified, &s;he laid down the
letter, and wept. &startq;So utterly, then,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;have I lo&s;t her? Even with her pen will &s;he not
&s;peak to me? How early is my life too long!&endq;</P>
<P>Taking up again, then, the letter, &s;he read what
follows.</P>

All that &s;he dares, &s;hall be done,&mdash;but that you may

<P>&startq;Ye&s;terday I &s;aw her looking at your picture;&endq; the

&s;he an&s;wered, with Mi&s;s Margland. This is no &s;ea&s;on

Were her under&s;tanding le&s;s good, I &s;hould le&s;s hea|vily

<P>She then rang the bell, and de&s;ired this note

<P>But this, the waiter an&s;wered, was impo&s;&s;ible;
the hor&s;e on which the me&s;&s;enger had &s;et out to

in her pocket: the &s;eal of her Father, the ring of
her Mother, the watch of her Uncle, and the locket
of Edgar landlebert. With one of the&s;e &s;he now
determined to part, in preference to any new ex|po&s;ure
at Eth$rington, or to incurring the &s;mall|e&s;t
debt. She de&s;ired to be left alone, and took
them from her pocket, one by one, painfully rumi|nating
upon which &s;he could bear to lo&s;e. &startq;It
<PB N="294" REF="121">
may not,&endq; &s;he thought, be for long; for quick, I
hope, my cour&s;e will end!&mdash;yet even for an hour,
&mdash;even for the la&s;t final moment&mdash;to give up &s;uch
dear &s;ymbols of all that has made my happine&s;s in
life!&mdash;</P>
<P>She looked at them, ki&s;&s;ed and pre&s;&s;ed them to
her heart; &s;poke to them as if living and under|&s;tanding
repre&s;entatives of their donors, and be|&s;towed
&s;o much time in lamenting care&s;&s;es and he|&s;itation,
that the waiter came again, while yet &s;he
was undetermined.</P>
<P>She de&s;ired to &s;peak to the mi&s;tre&s;s of the hou&s;e.</P>
<P>In&s;tinctively &s;he now put away the gifts of her
parents; but between her uncle and Edgar &s;he
wavered. She blu&s;hed, however, at her demur,
and the mode&s;ty of duty made her put up the
watch. Taking, then, and agitating la&s;t view of
a locket which circum&s;tances had rendered inap|preciable
to her, &startq;Ah! not in vain,&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;even now &s;hall I lo&s;e what once was a token &s;o
bewitching&mdash;Dear precious locket! Edgar even
yet would be happy you &s;hould do me one la&s;t kind
office! generou&s;ly, benevolently, he would rejoice
you &s;hould &s;pare me &s;till one la&s;t menacing
&s;hame!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>When Mrs. Marl, the landlady, came in, deeply
colouring, &s;he put it into her hand, turning her
eyes another way, while &s;he &s;aid; &startq;Mrs. Marl, I
have not quite money enough to pay the bill; but
if you will keep this locket for a &s;ecurity, you $word$
be &s;ure to be paid by and bye.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Marl looked at it with great admiration,
and then, with yet greater wonder, at Camilla.
&startq;'Tis pretty, indeed, ma'am,&endq; &s;he &s;aid; &startq;'twould
be pity to &s;ell it. However, I'll &s;hew it my hu&s;|band.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Marl &s;oon came him&s;elf, with looks &s;ome|what
le&s;s &s;atisfied, &startq;Tis a fine bauble, ma'am,&endq;
cried he, &startq;but I don't under&s;tand tho&s;e things;
and there's nobody here can tell me what it's worth.
I'd rather have my money, if you plea&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="295" REF="122">
Weakened now in body, as well as &s;pirits, &s;he
bur&s;t into tears. Alas! &s;he thought, how little do
my friends conjecture to what I am reduced! She
offered, however, the watch, and the countenance
of Mr. Marl lo&s;t its gloom.</P>
<P>&startq;This,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;is &s;omething like! A gold
watch one may be &s;ure to get one's own for; but
&s;uch a thing as that mayn't fetch &s;ixpence, fine as
it looks.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Marl objected to keeping both; but her
hu&s;band &s;aid he &s;aw no harm in it; and Camilla
begged her note might be &s;ent without delay.</P>
<P>A labourer, after &s;ome &s;earch, was found, who
undertook, for hand&s;ome pay, to carry it on foot
to the rectory.</P>
</DIV1>
<DIV1 N="30" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. XXX.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Spectacle.</HEAD>
<P>THE me&s;&s;enger returned not till midnight;
what, then, was the con&s;ternation of Camilla that
he brought no an&s;wer! She &s;u&s;pected he had not
found the hou&s;e; &s;he doubted if the letter had been
delivered; but he affirmed he had put it into the
hands of a maid-&s;ervant, though, as it was late, he
had come away directly, and not thought of wait|ing
for any an&s;wer.</P>
<P>It is not very early in life we learn how little is
performed, for which no precaution is taken.
Care is the offspring of di&s;appointment; and &s;orrow
and repentance commonly hang upon its fir&s;t le&s;|&s;ons.
Unu&s;ed to tran&s;act any &s;ort of bu&s;ine&s;s for
her&s;elf, &s;he had expected, in &s;ending a letter an
an&s;wer as a thing of cour&s;e, and had now only
her&s;elf to blame for not having ordered him to
&s;tay. She con&s;oled her&s;elf, however, that &s;he was
known to be but nine miles di&s;tant from the rectory,
<PB N="296" REF="123">
and that any commands could be conveyed to her
nearly in an hour.</P>
<P>What they might be, became now, therefore,
her &s;ole anxiety. Would not her Mother write?
After an avowal &s;uch as &s;he had made of her de&s;o|late,
if not dying condition, would &s;he not pardon
and embrace her? was it not even po&s;&s;ible &s;he
might come her&s;elf?</P>
<P>This idea mingled emotions of a contrariety
&s;carcely &s;upportable. &startq;O how,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;&s;hall
I &s;ee her? Can joy blend with &s;uch terror? Can I
wi&s;h her approach, yet not dare to meet her eye?
&mdash;that eye which never yet has looked at me, but
to beam with bright kindne&s;s!&mdash;though a kind|ne&s;s
that, even from my childhood, &s;eemed to &s;ay,
Camilla, be blamele&s;s&mdash;or you break your Mother's
heart!&mdash;my poor unhappy Mother! &s;he has al|ways
&s;eemed to have a pre&s;entiment, I was born to
bring her to &s;orrow!&endq;</P>
<P>Expectation being now, for this night, wholly
dead, the exce&s;s of her bodily fatigue urged her to
take &s;ome repo&s;e: but her ever eager imagination
made her apprehen&s;ive her friends might find her
too well, and &s;u&s;pect her repre&s;entation was but to
alarm them into returning kindne&s;s. A fourth
night, therefore, pa&s;&s;ed without &s;leep, or the re|fre&s;hment
of taking off her cloathes; and by the
time the morning &s;un &s;hone in upon her apart|ment,
&s;he was too &s;eriou&s;ly di&s;ordered to make her
illne&s;s require the aid of fancy. She was full of
fever, faint, pallid, weak, and &s;haken by nervous
tremors. &startq;I think,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;I am now cer|tainly
going; and never was death &s;o welcomed by
one &s;o young. It will end in &s;oft peace my brief,
but &s;tormy pa&s;&s;age, and I &s;hall owe to its &s;olemn
call the &s;acred ble&s;&s;ing of my offended Mother!&endq;</P>
<P>Tranquilli&s;ed by this hope, and this idea, &s;he
now lo&s;t all &s;ufferings but tho&s;e of di&s;ea&s;e: her mind
grew calm, her &s;pirits &s;erene: all fears gave way to
the certainty of &s;oothing kindne&s;s, all grief was
buried in the &s;olemnity of expected di&s;&s;olution.</P>
<P><PB N="297" REF="124">
But this compo&s;ure outlived not the fir&s;t hours
of the morning; as they vainly advanced, pro|ducing
no loved pre&s;ence, no letter, no &s;ummons;
&s;olicitude revived, di&s;appointment &s;unk her heart,
and dread preyed again upon her nerves. She
&s;tarted at every &s;ound; every breath of wind &s;eem|portentous;
&s;he li&s;tened upon the &s;tairs; &s;he drag|ged
her feeble limbs to the parlour, to be nearer
at hand; &s;he forced them back again to her bed|room,
to &s;train her aching eyes out of the win|dow;
but &s;till no voice demanded her, and no per|&s;on
approached.</P>
<P>Peggy, who repeatedly came to tell her the hour,
now a&s;&s;ured her it was dinner time: unable to eat,
&s;he was heedle&s;s of the hint this conveyed, and it
obtained from her no orders, till Peggy gave her
innocently to under&s;tand the expectations of her
ho&s;t and ho&s;te&s;s; but when, at five o'clock, the
table was &s;erved, all force and courage for&s;ook her.
To be le&s;t thus to her&s;elf, when her &s;ituation was
known; to be abandoned at an inn where &s;he had
confe&s;&s;ed &s;he thought her&s;elf dying;&mdash;&startq;My Mo|ther,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;cannot forgive me! my Father
him&s;elf de&s;erts me! O Edgar! you did well to fly
&s;o unhallowed a connexion!&endq;</P>
<P>She left her dinner for Peggy, and crawling up
&s;tairs, ca&s;t her&s;elf upon the bed, with a de&s;perate
&s;upplication &s;he might ri&s;e from it no more. &startq;The
time,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;is pa&s;t for con&s;olation, and dead
for hope! my parents' own prayers have been
averted, and their progno&s;tics fulfilled. <HI>May the
dread forfeiture,</HI> &s;aid my deare&s;t Father, <HI>not extend
through my daughters!</HI>&mdash;Alas! Lionel him&s;elf has
not brought upon him a di&s;grace &s;uch as I have

<HI>&s;pare me evil under your &s;hape at lea&s;t!</HI>&mdash;but under
that it has come to her the mo&s;t heavily!&endq;</P>
<P>Di&s;&s;olving, then, in &s;orrowing regret, recollecti|ons
of maternal tenderne&s;s bathed her pillow with
her tears, and rever&s;ing all the inducements to her
&s;ad re&s;ignation, aboli&s;hed every wi&s;h but to fall&punc;
<PB N="298" REF="125">
again at the parental feet. &startq;To &s;ee,&endq; cried &s;he,
&startq;once more, the dear authors of my being! to re|ceive
their forgivene&s;s, their ble&s;&s;ing&mdash;to view
again their honoured countenances!&mdash;to hear once
more their loved &s;peech&mdash;Alas! was it I that
fled the voice of my Mother? That voice which,
till that moment, had been mu&s;ic to my mind! and
never reached my ear, but as the precur&s;or of all
kindne&s;s! why did I not &s;ooner at once kneel at
her feet, and &s;eek my lo&s;t path under my fir&s;t and
be&s;t guide?&endq;</P>
<P>Shocked and contrite in this tardy view of &s;tep
&s;he ought to have taken, &s;he now langui&s;hed to
petition for pardon even for an offence unknown;
and ri&s;ing, took up a pen to relate the whole tran&s;|action.
But her head was confu&s;ed, and the at|tempt
&s;hewed her &s;he was more ill than &s;he had
even her&s;elf &s;u&s;pected. She thought all rapidly
advancing, and enthu&s;ia&s;tically rejoiced.</P>
<P>Yet a &s;econd time &s;he took the pen; but it had
not touched the paper, when a buzzing, confu&s;ed,
&s;ti$$ed &s;ort of noi&s;e from without drew her to the
window.</P>
<P>She then perceived an immen&s;e crowd of people
approaching &s;lowly, and from a di&s;tance, towards
the inn.</P>
<P>As they advanced, &s;he was &s;truck to hear no en|crea&s;e
of noi&s;e, &s;ave from the nearer trampling of
feet. No voice was di&s;tingui&s;hable; no one &s;poke
$ouder than the re&s;t; they &s;eemed even to tread the
ground with caution. They con&s;i&s;ted of labourers,
workmen, beggars, women, and children, joined
by &s;ome accidental pa&s;&s;engers: yet the general
&startq;hum of many&endq; was all that was heard; they were
&s;ilent though numerous, &s;olemn though mixt.</P>
<P>As they came near, &s;he thought &s;he perceived
&s;omething in the mid&s;t of them like a bier, and
caught a glimp&s;e of a gentleman's habit. Startled,
&s;he drew in; but &s;oon, upon a$other view, di&s;cern|ed
clearly a well-dre&s;&s;ed man, &s;tretched out his full
length, and apparently dead.</P>
<P><PB N="299" REF="126">
Recoiling, &s;huddering, &s;he ha&s;tily &s;hut the win|dow,
&startq;Yet why,&endq; &s;he cried, the next moment,
&startq;and whence this emotion? Is not death what I
am meeting?&mdash;&s;eeking?&mdash;de&s;iring?&mdash;what I court?
what I pray for?&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;ighed, walked feebly up and down the
room, breathed hard and with effort, and then
forced her&s;elf again to open the window, deter|mined
to contemplate &s;teadily the anticipating ob|ject
of her fervent demand.</P>
<P>Yet not without &s;evere &s;elf-compul&s;ion &s;he flung
up again the &s;a&s;h; but when &s;he looked out, the
crowd alone remained; the bier was gone.</P>
<P>Whether carried on, or brought into the hou&s;e,
&s;he now wi&s;hed to know, with &s;ome particulars,
of whom it might be, and what belonged to &s;o
&s;trange and horrible an appearance.</P>
<P>She rang for little Peggy; but Peggy came not.
She rang again, but no one an&s;wered the bell. She
opened her door, meaning to de&s;cend to her little
parlour for information; but the murmuring buzz
&s;he had before heard upon the road, was now
within the hou&s;e, which &s;eemed filled with people,
all bu&s;y and occupied, yet &s;peaking low, and ap|pearing
to partake of a general awe.</P>
<P>She could not venture to encounter &s;o many
&s;pectators; &s;he &s;hut her door, to wait quietly till
this fir&s;t commotion &s;hould be pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>This was not for more than an hour; when ob|&s;erving,
from her window, that the crowd was di&s;|per&s;ed,
&s;he again li&s;tened at the door, and found
that the general di&s;turbance was &s;ucceeded by a
&s;tillne&s;s the mo&s;t profound.</P>
<P>She then rang again, and little Peggy appeared,
but looking pale and much frightened.</P>
<P>Camilla a&s;ked what had been the matter</P>
<P>&startq;O ma'am,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, crying, &startq;here's
been murder! A gentleman has been murdered&mdash;
and nobody knows who he is, nor who has
done it!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="300" REF="127">
She then related that he had been found dead
in a wood hard by, and one per&s;on calling another,
and another, he had been brought to the inn to be
owned.</P>
<P>&startq;And is he here now?&endq; with an involuntary
&s;hudder, a&s;ked Camilla.</P>
<LETTER>
<P>Yes, &s;he an&s;wered, but her mi&s;tre&s;s had ordered
her not to own it, for fear of frightening the young
lady; and &s;aid he would &s;oon be carried away.</P>
<P>The tale was &s;hocking, and, though &s;carce con|&s;cious
why, Camilla de&s;ired Peggy to &s;tay with her.</P>
<P>The little girl was mo&s;t willing; but &s;he was
pre&s;ently called down &s;tairs; and Camilla, with
&s;trong &s;hame of namele&s;s fears and weak horror,
&s;trove to meditate to &s;ome u&s;e upon this &s;cene.</P>
<P>But her mind was di&s;turbed, her compo&s;ure was
gone; her thoughts were broken, abrupt, unfixed,
and all upon which &s;he could dwell with any &s;tea|dine&s;s,
was the de&s;ire of one more appeal to her
family, that yet they would con&s;ent to &s;ee her, if
they received it in time; or that they &s;hould know
in what frame of mind &s;he expired, &s;hould it
bring them too late.</P>
<P>With infinite difficulty, &s;he then wrote the fol|lowing
lines; every bending down of her head
making it ache nearly to di&s;traction.</P>
<P>&startq;Adieu, my deare&s;t parents, if again it is de|nied
me to &s;ee you! Adieu my darling &s;i&s;ters! my
tender uncle! I a&s;k not now your forgivene&s;s; I

withheld it,&mdash;and my Mother, if again&s;t her&s;elf

lenient; would have probed but to heal, have
corrected but to pardon. O tendere&s;t of united
partners! ble&s;s, then, the early a&s;hes of your
erring, but adoring daughter, who, from the

This &s;he gave to Peggy, with a charge that, at
any expence, it might be conveyed to the rectory

<P>&startq;And &s;hall I not, thought &s;he, when &s;he had
re&s;ted from this exertion, and may I not at &s;uch
a period, with innocence, with propriety, write
one poor word to him who was &s;o near becoming
fir&s;t to me in all things?&endq;</P>
<P>She again took her pen, but had only written
&startq;O Edgar! in this la&s;t farewell be all di&s;plea&s;ure
forgotten!&mdash;from the fir&s;t to the final moment

&s;topt her hand, and ha&s;tily writing the direction,
le&s;t &s;he could write no more, &s;he, with difficulty
added, <HI>Not to be delivered till I am dead;</HI> and was
forced to lie down, and &s;hut all light from her
&s;trained and aching eyes.</P>
<P>Peggy pre&s;ently brought her word that all the
hor&s;es were out, and every body was engaged, and
that the note could not po&s;&s;ibly go till the next day.</P>
<P>Extremely di&s;appointed, &s;he begged to &s;peak
with Mrs. Marl; who &s;ent her word &s;he was
much engaged, but would wait upon her as &s;oon
as &s;he was able.</P>
<P>Vainly, however, &s;he expected her; it grew
du&s;k; felt her&s;elf wor&s;e every moment; flu&s;hed
with fever, or &s;hivering with cold, and her head
nearly &s;plit a&s;under with agony. She determined
to go once more down &s;tairs, and offer to her ho&s;t
him&s;elf any reward he could claim, &s;o he would
undertake the immediate delivery of the letter.</P>
<P>With difficulty &s;he aro&s;e; with &s;low &s;teps, and
tottering &s;he de&s;cended; but as &s;he approached her
little parlour, &s;he heard voices in it, and &s;topt.
They &s;poke low, and &s;he could not di&s;tingui&s;h
them. The door of an adjoining room was open,
and by its &s;tillne&s;s empty; &s;he re&s;olved to ring
there, to demand to &s;peak with Mr. Marl. But
as &s;he dragged her weak limbs into the apartment,
<PB N="302" REF="129">
&s;he &s;aw, &s;tretched out upon a large table, the &s;ame
form, dre&s;s, and figure &s;he had &s;een upon the bier.</P>
<P>Starting, almo&s;t fainting, but too much awed to
call out, &s;he held trembling by the door.</P>
<P>The bodily feeblene&s;s which impeded her im|mediate
retreat, gave force to a little mental re|flection:
Do I &s;hrink thus, thought &s;he, from
what &s;o earne&s;tly I have prayed to become&mdash;and
&s;o &s;oon I mu&s;t repre&s;ent&mdash;a picture of death?</P>
<P>She now impelled her&s;elf towards the table. A
cloth covered the face; &s;he &s;tood &s;till, he&s;itating
if &s;he had power to remove it: but &s;he thought it
a call to her own &s;elf-examination; and though
mentally recoiling, advanced. When clo&s;e to the
table, &s;he &s;tood &s;till, violently trembling. Yet
&s;he would not allow her&s;elf to retreat. She now
put forth her hand; but it &s;hook &s;u&s;pended over
the linen, without courage to draw it a&s;ide. At
length, however, with enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;elf compul|&s;ion,
&s;lightly and fearfully, &s;he lifted it up&mdash;
but in&s;tantly, and with in&s;tinctive horror, &s;natched
her hand away, and placed it before her &s;hut eyes.</P>
<P>She felt, now, &s;he had tried her&s;elf beyond her
courage, and, deeply moved, was fain to retreat;
but in letting down her hand, to &s;ee her way, &s;he
found &s;he had already removed the linen from a
part of the face, and the view &s;he unintentionally
caught almo&s;t petrified her.</P>
<P>For &s;ome in&s;tants &s;he &s;tood motionle&s;s, from
want of &s;trength to &s;tir, but with clo&s;ed eyes, that
feared to confirm their fir&s;t &s;urmi&s;e; but when,
turning from the gha&s;tly vi&s;age, &s;he attempted,
without another glance, to glide away, an unavoid|able
view of the coat, which &s;uddenly &s;he recog|nized,
put her conjecture beyond all doubt, that
&s;he now &s;aw dead before her the hu&s;band of her
&s;i&s;ter.</P>
<P>Re&s;entment, in gentle minds, however merited
and provoked, &s;urvives not the breath of the of|fender.
With the certainty no further evil can
be practi&s;ed, peri&s;hes vengeance again&s;t the culprit,
<PB N="303" REF="130">
though not hatred of the guilt: and though, with
the fir&s;t movement of &s;i&s;terly feelings, &s;he would
have &s;aid, Is Eugenia then relea&s;ed? the awe was
too great, his own change was too &s;olemn. He
was now where no human eye could follow, no
human judgment overtake him.</P>
<P>Again &s;he endeavoured to e&s;cape the dreadful
&s;cene, but her &s;haking limbs were refractory, and
would not &s;upport her. The mortal being re|quires
u&s;e to be reconciled to its own vi&s;ible mor|tality;
di&s;mal is its view; grim, repul&s;ive, terrific
its a&s;pect.</P>
<P>But no &s;ooner was her head turned from the
dire object, than alarm for her &s;i&s;ter took po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
of her &s;oul; and with what recollection &s;he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, &s;he determined to go to Belfont.</P>
<P>An idea of any active &s;ervice invigorates the
body as well as the mind. She made another effort
to depart, but a glance &s;he knew not how to avoid
&s;hewed her, upon the coat of the right arm and
right &s;ide of this gha&s;tly figure, large &s;pla&s;hes of
blood.</P>
<P>With horror thus accumulated, &s;he now &s;unk
upon the floor, inwardly exclaiming: He is mur|dered
indeed!&mdash;and where may be Eugenia?</P>
<P>A woman who had in charge to watch by the
corp&s;e, but who had privately &s;tolen out for &s;ome
refre&s;hment, now returning, &s;aw with affright the
new per&s;on in the room, and ran to call Mrs.
Marl; who, alarmed al&s;o at the &s;ight of the young
lady, and at her deplorable condition, a&s;&s;i&s;ted the
woman to remove her from the apartment, and
convey her to the chamber, where &s;he was laid
down upon the bed, though &s;he re&s;i&s;ted being un|dre&s;&s;ed,
and was &s;eized with an agui&s;h &s;hivering
fit, while her eyes &s;eemed emitting &s;parks of fire.</P>
<P>&startq;It is certainly now,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;over, and
hence I move no more!&endq;</P>
<P>The joy with which, a few minutes before,
&s;he would have welcomed &s;uch a belief, was now
converted into an awe un&s;peakable, undefinable.
<PB N="304" REF="131">
The wi&s;h of death is commonly but di&s;gu&s;t of life,
and looks forward to nothing further than relea&s;e
from worldly care:&mdash;but the &s;omething yet be|yond&mdash;the
&s;omething unknown, untried, yet
to come, the <HI>bourne whence no traveller returns</HI> to
prepare &s;ucceeding pa&s;&s;engers for what they may
expect now abruptly pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her con&s;i|deration,&mdash;but came to &s;care, not to &s;oothe.</P>
<P>All here, &s;he cried, I have wi&s;hed to leave&mdash;but&mdash;have I fitted my&s;elf for what I am to
meet?</P>
<P>Con&s;cience now &s;uddenly took the reins from
the hands of imagination, and a mi&s;t was cleared
away that hitherto, ob&s;curing every duty by de&s;|pondence,
had hidden from her own perceptions
the faulty ba&s;is of her de&s;ire. Con&s;cience took the
reins&mdash;and a mi&s;t was cleared away that had con|cealed
from her view the cruelty of this egoti&s;m.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e friends, it cried, which thus impatiently
$word$ou &s;eeke&s;t to quit, have they not loved, cheri&s;h|ed,
reared thee with the mo&s;t exqui&s;ite care and
kindne&s;s? If they are offended, who has offended
them? If thou art now abandoned, may it not be
from nece&s;&s;ity, or from accident? When th$n
ha&s;t inflicted upon them the &s;evere pain of har|bouring
anger again&s;t what is &s;o dear to them,
would&s;t thou load them with regret that they ma|nife&s;ted
any &s;en&s;ibility of thy errors? Ha&s;t thou
plunged thy hou&s;e in calamity, and will no wor|thier
wi&s;h occur to thee, than to leave it to its
&s;orrows and di&s;tre&s;s, with the aggravating pangs of
cau&s;ing thy afflicting, however blameable &s;elf|de&s;ertion?
of coming to thee&mdash;perhaps even
now!&mdash;with mild forgivene&s;s, and finding
thee a &s;elf devoted corp&s;e?&mdash;not fallen, indeed, by
the profane hand of daring &s;uicide, but equally
&s;elf-murdered through wilful &s;elf neglect.</P>
<P>Had the voice been allowed &s;ound which &s;poke
this dire admonition, it could &s;carcely with more
horror, or keener repentance have &s;truck her.
&startq;That poor man,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;now delivering
<PB N="305" REF="132">
up his account, by whatever hand he peri&s;hed, &s;ince
le&s;s principled, le&s;s in&s;tructed than my&s;elf, may be
criminal, perhaps, with le&s;s guilt!&endq;</P>
<P>The thought now of her Father,&mdash;the piety he had
&s;trove to inculcate into her mind; his re&s;ignation to
misfortune, and his tru&s;t through every &s;uffering, all
came home to her heart, with religious veneration;
and making prayer &s;ucceed to remor&s;e, guided her to
what &s;he knew would be his guidance if pre&s;ent, and
&s;he de$$ed to hear the &s;ervice for the &s;ick.</P>
<P>Peggy could not read; Mrs. Marl was too much
engaged; the whole hou&s;e had ample employment,
and her reque&s;t was una$tainable.</P>
<P>She then begged they would procure her a prayer|book,
that &s;he might try to read her&s;elf; but her eyes,
heavy, aching, and dim, glared upon the p$per, with|out
di&s;tingui&s;hing the print from the margin.</P>
<P>&startq;I am wor&s;e!&endq; &s;he cried faintly, &startq;my wi&s;h
comes fa&s;t upon me! Ah! not for my puni&s;hment let
it finally arrive!&endq;</P>
<P>With terror, however, even more than with malady,
&s;he now trembled. The horrible &s;ight &s;he had wit|ne&s;&s;ed,
brought death before her in a new view. She
feared &s;he had been pre&s;umptuous; &s;he felt that her
preparations had all been worldly, her impatience
wholly &s;elfi&s;h. She called back her wi&s;h, with peni|tence
and affright: her agitation became torture, her
regret was aggravated to remor&s;e, her grief to de&s;pair.</P>

<P>WHEN the fir&s;t violence of this paroxy&s;m of &s;or|row
abated, Camilla again &s;trove to pray, and found
that nothing &s;o much &s;tilled her. Yet, her faculties
confu&s;ed, hurried, and in angui&s;h, permitted little
more than incoherent ejaculations. Again &s;he &s;ighed
for her Father; again the &s;pirit of his in&s;tructions re|curred,
and &s;he enquired who was the clergyman of
<PB N="306" REF="133">
the pari&s;h, and if he would be humane enough to come
and pray by one who had no claim upon him as a
pari&s;hioner.</P>
<P>Peggy &s;aid he was a very good gentleman, and ne|ver
refu&s;ed even the poore&s;t per&s;on, that begged his
attendance.</P>
<P>&startq;O go to him, then,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;directly!
Tell him a &s;ick and helple&s;s &s;tranger implores that he
will read to her the prayers for the dying!&mdash;Should
I yet live&mdash;They will compo&s;e and make
me better;&mdash;if not&mdash;they will give me courage
for my quick exit.&endq;</P>
<P>Peggy went forth, and &s;he laid her beating head
upon the pillow, and endeavoured to quiet her nerves
for the &s;acred ceremony &s;he demanded.</P>
<P>It was dark, and &s;he was alone; the corp&s;e &s;he had
ju&s;t quitted &s;eemed &s;till bleeding in full view. She
clo&s;ed her eyes, but &s;till &s;aw it; &s;he opened them,
but it was always there. She felt nearly &s;tiff with
horror, chilled, frozen, with &s;peechle&s;s apprehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>A &s;lumber, feveri&s;h nearly to delirium, at length
&s;urpri&s;ed her harra&s;&s;ed faculties; but not to afford
them re&s;t. Death, in a vi&s;ible figure, gha&s;tly, pallid,
&s;evere, appeared before her, and with its hand, &s;harp
and forked, &s;truck abruptly upon her brea&s;t. She
&s;creamed&mdash;but it was heavy as cold, and &s;he could
not remove it. She trembled; &s;he &s;hrunk from its
touch; but it had iced her heart-&s;trings. Every
vein was congealed; every &s;tiffened limb &s;tretched to
its full length, was hard as marble: and when again
$he made a feeble effort to rid her oppre&s;&s;ed lungs of
the dire weight that had fallen upon them, a voice
hollow, deep, and di&s;tant, dreadfully pierced her ear,
calling out: &startq;Thou ha&s;t but thy own wi&s;h! &startq;Re|joice,
thou murmurer, for thou die&s;t!&endq; Clearer,
&s;h$iller, another voice quick vibrated in the air:
&startq;Whither goe&s;t thou,&endq; it cried, &startq;and whence
come&s;t thou?&endq;</P>
<P>A voice from within, over which &s;he thought &s;he
had no controul, though it &s;eemed i&s;&s;uing from her
vitals, low, hoar&s;e, and tremulous, an&s;wered, &startq;Whi|ther
<PB N="307" REF="134">
I go, let me re&s;t! Whence I come from let
me not look back! Tho&s;e who gave me birth, I
have de&s;erted; my life, my vital powers I have
rejected.&endq; Quick then another voice a&s;&s;ailed her.
&s;o near, &s;o loud, &s;o terrible&mdash;&s;he &s;hri$ked at its
horrible &s;ound. &startq;Prematurely,&endq; it cried, &startq;thou
art come, uncalled, unbidden; thy ta&s;k unfulfilled,
thy peace unearned. Follow, follow me! the
Records of Eternity are opened. Come! write
with thy own hand thy claims, thy merits to
mercy!&endq; A repelling &s;elf-accu&s;ation in&s;tantaneou&s;ly
overwhelmed her. &startq;O, no! no! no!&endq; &s;he ex|claimed,
&startq;let me not &s;ign my own mi&s;erable in|&s;ufficiency!&endq;
In vain was her appeal. A force
un&s;een, yet irre&s;i&s;tible, impelled her forward. She
&s;aw the immen&s;e volumes of Eternity, and her own
hand involuntarily gra&s;ped a pen of iron, and with a
velocity uncontroulable wrote the&s;e words: &startq;Without
re&s;ignation, I have prayed for death: from impa|tience
of di&s;plea&s;ure, I have de&s;ired annihilation:
to dry my own eyes, I have left&mdash;pitile&s;s,
&s;elfi&s;h, unnatural!&mdash;a Father the mo&s;t indul|gent,
a Mother almo&s;t idolizing, to weep out
their's!&endq; Her head would have &s;unk upon the
guilty characters; but her eye-lids refu&s;ed to clo&s;e,
and kept them gluring before her. They became, then,
illuminated with burning &s;ulphur. She looked another
way; but they partook of the &s;ame motion; &s;he ca&s;t
her eyes upwards, but &s;he &s;aw the characters &s;till;
$word$ turned from &s;ide to &s;ide; but they were always her
object. Loud ag$in &s;ounded the &s;ame direful voice:
&startq;The&s;e are thy de&s;erts; write now thy claims:&mdash;
and next,&mdash;and quick,&mdash;turn over the immortal leaves,
and read thy doom.&endq;&mdash;&startq;Oh, no!&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;Oh, no!&endq;&mdash;&startq;O, let me yet return! O, Earth,
with all thy &s;orrows, take, take me once again,
that better I may learn to work my way to that la&s;t
harbour, which, rejecting the criminal repiner,
opens its &s;oft bo&s;om to the firm, though &s;upplicating
&s;ufferer!&endq; In vain again &s;he called;&mdash;pleaded,
knelt, wept in vain. The time, &s;he found, was pa&s;t;
<PB N="308" REF="135">
&s;he had &s;lighted it while in her power; it would re|turn
to her no more; and a thou&s;and voices at once,
with awful vibration, an&s;wered aloud to every prayer,
&startq;Death was thy own de&s;ire!&endq; Again, unlicen&s;ed by
her will, her hand &s;eized the iron in&s;trument. The
book was open that demanded her claims. She wrote
w$th difficulty&mdash;but &s;aw that her pen made no
mark! She looked upon the page, when &s;he thought
&s;he had fini&s;hed,&mdash;but the paper was blank!&mdash;Voices
then, by hundreds, by thou&s;ands, by millions,
from &s;ide to &s;ide, above, below, around, called out,
echoed and re-echoed, &startq;Turn over, turn over&mdash;
and read thy eternal doom:&endq; In the &s;ame in&s;tant, the
leaf, untouched, bur&s;t open&mdash;and&mdash;&s;he awoke.
But in a trepidation &s;o viol$nt, the bed &s;hook under
her, the cold &s;weat, in large drops, fell from her
forehead, and her heart &s;till &s;eemed labouring under
the adamantine pre&s;&s;ure of the inflexibly cold g$a&s;p of
death. So exaited was her imagination, &s;o confu&s;ed
were all her thinking faculties, that &s;he &s;tared with
wild doubt whether then, or$ whether now, what &s;he
experienced were a dream.</P>
<P>In this &s;u&s;pen&s;ive &s;tate, fearing to call, to move,
or almo&s;t to breath, &s;he remained, in perfect &s;tillne&s;s,
and in the dark, till little Peggy crept &s;oftly into the
chamber.</P>
<P>Certain then of her &s;ituation, &startq;This has been,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;only a vi&s;ion&mdash;but my con&s;$$ence has
abetted it, and I cannot &s;hake it off.&endq;</P>
<P>When &s;he became calmer, and further recollected
her&s;elf, &s;he anxiou&s;ly enquired if the clergyman would
not come.</P>
<P>Peggy, he&s;itatingly, acknowledged he had not been
&s;ent for; her mi&s;tre&s;s had imagined the reque&s;t pro|ceeded
from a di&s;turbance of mind, owing to the &s;ight
of the corp&s;e, and &s;aid &s;he was &s;ure, after a little
&s;leep it would be forgotten.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas!&endq; &s;aid Camilla, di&s;appointed, &startq;it is more
nece&s;&s;ary than ever! my &s;en&s;es are wandering; I &s;eem
hovering between life and death&mdash;Ah! let not my&endq;
<PB N="309" REF="136">
own fearful fancies ab&s;orb this hour of change, which
religious rites &s;hould con&s;ecrate!&endq;</P>
<P>She then told Peggy to plead for her to her mi&s;|tre&s;s&punc;
and a&s;&s;ure her that nothing el&s;e, after the
dreadful &s;hock &s;he had received, could &s;till her mind.</P>
<P>Mrs. Marl, not long after came into the room her|&s;elf;
and enquiring how &s;he did, &s;aid, if &s;he was
really bent upon &s;uch a melancholy thing, the cler|gyman
had luckily ju&s;t called, and would read the
&s;ervice to her directly, if it would give her any com|fort</P>
<P>&startq;O, great and infinite comfort!&endq; &s;he cried, and
begged he might come immediately, and read to her
the prayer for tho&s;e of whom there is but &s;mall hope
of recovery. She would have ri&s;en, that &s;he might
kneel; but her limbs would not &s;econd her de&s;ire, and
&s;he was obliged to lie &s;till upon the out&s;ide of the
bed. Peggy drew the curtains, to &s;hade her eyes, as
a candle was brought into the room; but when &s;he
heard Mrs. Marl &s;ay: &startq;Come in&punc; Sir,&endq;&mdash;and &startq;here's
the prayer book;&endq; overpowered with tender recol|lection
of her Father, to whom &s;uch offices were fre|quent,
&s;he bur&s;t into an agony of tears, and hid her
face upon the pillow.</P>
<P>She &s;oon&punc; however, recovered, and the &s;olemnity
of the preparation overawed her &s;orrow Mrs. Marl
placed the light as far as po&s;&s;ible from the bed, and
when Camilla waved her hand in token of being
ready, &s;aid, &startq;Now, Sir, if you plea&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>He complied, though not immediately; but no
&s;ooner had he begun, no &s;ooner, devoutly, yet tremb|lingly,
pronounced, <HI>O Father of Mercies!</HI> than a
faint &s;cream i&s;&s;ued from the bed.&mdash;</P>
<P>He &s;topt; but &s;he did not &s;peak; and after a
&s;hort pau&s;e, he re&s;umed: but not a &s;econd &s;entence
was pronounced, when &s;he feebly ejaculated, &startq;Ah
heaven!&endq; and the book fell from his hands.</P>
<P>She &s;trove to rai&s;e her head, but could not; &s;he
opened, however, the &s;ide curtain, to look out; he
advanced at the &s;ame moment, to the foot of the
<PB N="310" REF="137">
bed&mdash;fixed his eyes upon her face, and in a voice
that &s;eemed to come from his &s;oul, exclaimed, &startq;Ca|milla!&endq;</P>
<P>With a mental emotion that, for an in&s;tant, re|&s;tored
her &s;trength, &s;he drew again the curtain, co|vered
up her face, and &s;obbed even audibly, while
the words, &startq;O Edgar!&endq; vainly &s;ought vent.</P>
<P>He attempted not to unclo&s;e the curtain &s;he had
drawn, but with a deep groan, dropping upon his
knees on the out&s;ide, cried, &startq;Great God!&endq; but
checking him&s;elf, ha&s;tily aro&s;e, and mentioning to
Mrs. Marl and to Peggy, to move out of hearing,
&s;aid, through the curtain, &startq;O Camilla! what dire
calamity has brought this about?&mdash;&s;peak, I implore!
&mdash;why are you here?&mdash;why alone?&mdash;&s;peak, &s;peak!&endq;</P>
<P>He heard &s;he was weeping, but received no an|&s;wer,
and with energy next to torture, exclaimed;
&startq;Refu&s;e not to tru&s;t me!&mdash;recollect our long friend|&s;hip
&mdash;forgive&mdash;forget its alienation!&mdash;By all you
have ever valued&mdash;by all your wonted genero&s;ity&mdash;I
call&mdash;I appeal&mdash;Camilla! Camilla!&mdash;your &s;ilence
rends my &s;oul!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla had no utterance, yet could not re&s;i&s;t this
urgency, and gently through the opening of the
curtain, put forth her &s;eeble hand.</P>
<P>He &s;eemed affected to agony; he held it between
each of his own, and while &s;oftly he uttered, &startq;O
ever&mdash;unchangeable generous Camilla!&endq; &s;he felt it
moi&s;tened with his tears.</P>
<P>Too weak for the new &s;en&s;ation this excited, &s;he
drew it away, and the violence of her emotion me|nacing
an hy&s;teric fit. Mrs Marl came back to her,
and wringing his hands as he looked around the room,
he tore him&s;elf away.</P>

<P>DECLINING all aid, Camilla continued in the

&s;tifling &s;ighs that were ri&s;ing into lobs, till &s;he heard
a gentle tap at her door.</P>
<P>She &s;tarted, but &s;till hid her&s;elf: Mrs Marl was

<P>&startq;Yes, he went directly, my dear Lady.&endq;</P>
<P>She threw the covering from her face, and with
uplifted hands&punc; exclaimed, &startq;O Edgar!&mdash;could you
&s;ee me thus&mdash;and leave me?&endq;&mdash;Yet eagerly &s;eiz|ing
the letter, called for a candle, and &s;trove to read

and dazzled eyes, and &s;he was forced to relinqui&s;h
the attempt. She pre&s;&s;ed it to her bo&s;om, and again
covered her&s;elf up.</P>
<P>Something, neverthele&s;s, like internal revival once
more, to her own un&s;peakable amazement, began
fluttering at her brea&s;t. She had &s;een the beloved
of her heart&mdash;dearer to her far than the life &s;he
thought her&s;elf re&s;igning; &s;een him penetrated to
angui&s;h by her &s;ituation, awakened to the tendere&s;t

of his &s;en&s;ibility, that, dead as &s;he had thought
her&s;elf to the world, its views, its hopes, its cares,
pa&s;&s;ed &s;traight to her heart&mdash;that wonderful repo&s;i|tory
of &s;ucce&s;&s;ive emotions, whence the expul&s;ion of
one &s;pecies of intere&s;t but makes way for the en|trance
of another; and which vainly, while yet in

mortal life, builds, even from hour to hour, upon
any cha&s;m of mortal &s;olicitude.</P>
<P>While wrapt up in this reverie, poignantly agi|tating,
yet undefinably &s;oothing, upon the return of
Edgar to England, and his a&s;toni&s;hing appearance in
her room, her attention was again arou&s;ed by ano|ther
gentle tap at the door</P>
<P>Peggy opened it, and left the room; but &s;oon

<P>&startq;Waiting?&endq; &s;he repeated, in extreme trepidati|on,
&startq;is he not then gone?&endq;</P>

<P>A &s;en&s;ation of plea&s;ure was now &s;o new to Ca|milla,
as almo&s;t to be too potent either for her

Yet &s;he called Peggy to her again, again
a&s;ked her if it were indeed true; and, bidding her
once more bring the candle, the new &s;pirit with

<P>Di&s;&s;olved in tears of tenderne&s;s, relieving, nay de|lightful,
&s;he immediately &s;ent him word that &s;he
accepted his kind office, and &s;hould feel eternal gra|titude
if he would acquaint her friends with her
&s;ituation.</P>
<P>Peggy &s;oon informed her the gentleman was
gone; and &s;he then inquired why he had been
brought to her as a clergyman.</P>
<P>The little girl gave the account with the utmo&s;t
&s;implicity. Her mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;he &s;aid, knew the gentle|man
very well, who was 'Squire Mandlebert, and
lived at a great hou&s;e not many miles off; and had
ju&s;t alighted to bait his hor&s;es, as &s;he went to a&s;k
about &s;ending for the clergyman. He inquired who
was ill; and her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;aid it was a Lady who
had gone out of her mind, by &s;eeing a dead body,
and raved of nothing but having prayers read to her;
which her hu&s;band would do, when his hou&s;e was
clear, if the humour la&s;ted: for they had nobody to
&s;end three miles off; and by drawing the curtains,
&s;he would not know if it was a clergyman or not.
The young 'Squire then a&s;ked if &s;he was a lodger
or a traveller, and her mi&s;tre&s;s an&s;wered: &startq;She's a
traveller, Sir; and if it had not been for Peggy's
knowing her, we &s;hould have been afraid who &s;he
might be; for &s;he &s;tays here, and never pays us;
only &s;he has given us a watch and a locket for
pledges.&endq; Then he a&s;ked on &s;ome more que&s;tions,
continued Peggy, and pre&s;ently de&s;ired to &s;ee the
locket; and when he had looked at it, he turned as
white as a &s;heet, and &s;aid he mu&s;t &s;ee the lady. Her
mi&s;tre&s;s &s;aid &s;he was laid down upon the bed, and
&s;he could not &s;end in a gentleman; unle&s;s it was her
hu&s;band; ju&s;t to quiet her poor head by reading her
<PB N="314" REF="141">
a prayer or two. So then the 'Squire &s;aid he'd take
the prayer book and read to her him&s;elf, if &s;he'd
&s;pare time to go into the room fir&s;t, and &s;hut up the
curtains. So her mi&s;tre&s;s &s;aid no, at fir&s;t; but Peggy
&s;aid the poor lady fretted on &s;o badly, that pre&s;ently
up they came together.</P>
<P>Ah! dear darling locket! internally cried Camilla,
how from the fir&s;t have I loved&mdash;how to the la&s;t will
I prize it! Ah dear darling locket!&mdash;how for ever&mdash;
while I live&mdash;will I wear it in my bo&s;om!</P>
<P>A calm now took place of her agonies that made
her &s;eem in a renovated exi&s;tence, till &s;leep, by gen|tle
approaches, &s;tole upon her again: not to bring
to her the dread vi&s;ion which accompanied its fir&s;t re|turn;
nor yet to allow her tranquil repo&s;e. A &s;ofter
form appeared before her; more afflictive, though
not &s;o horrible; it was the form of her Mother;
all di&s;plea&s;ure removed from her penetrating counte|nance;
no longer in her dying child viewing the
child that had offended her; yet while forgiving and
embracing&punc; &s;eeing her expire in her arms.</P>
<P>She awaked, affrighted,&mdash;&s;he &s;tarted, &s;he &s;at up|right;
&s;he called aloud upon her Mother, and wildly
looking around, thought &s;he &s;aw her at the foot of
the bed.</P>
<P>She cro&s;&s;ed her eyes with her hands, to endeavour
to clear her &s;ight: but the object only &s;eemed more
di&s;tinct. She bent forward, &s;eeking conviction, yet
incredulous, though &s;till meeting the &s;ame form.</P>
<P>Sighing, at la&s;t, from fruitle&s;s fatigue; 'tis won|drous
odd,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;but I now never know when
I wake or when I &s;leep!&endq;</P>
<P>The form glided away; but with motion &s;o palpa|ble,
&s;he could no longer believe her&s;elf played upon
by imagination. Awe-impre&s;t, and wonder-&s;truck,
&s;he &s;oftly opened her &s;ide-curtain to look after it. It
had &s;topt by a high che&s;t of drawers, again&s;t which,
leaning its head upon its arm, it &s;tood erect, but
&s;eemed weeping. She could not di&s;cern the face;
but the whole figure had the &s;ame &s;acred re&s;emblance.</P>
<P><PB N="315" REF="142">
The pul&s;es of her head beat now with &s;o much
violence, &s;he was forced to hold her temples. Doubt,
dread, and hope &s;eized every faculty at once; till,
at length, the uprai&s;ed arm of the form before her
dropt, and &s;he di&s;tinctly &s;aw the profile: &startq;It is
her&s;elf! it is my Mother!&endq; &s;he &s;creamed, rather
than pronounced, and threw her&s;elf from the bed to
the floor.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes! it is your Mother!&endq; was repeated, in a
tone &s;olemn and penetrating;&mdash;&startq;to what a &s;cene,
O Camilla, returned; her hou&s;e abandoned&mdash;her &s;on
in exile&mdash;her Eugenia lo&s;t&mdash;her hu&s;band, the prop of
all!&mdash;where &s;he dur&s;t not name!&mdash;and thou, the child
of her bo&s;om!&mdash;the con&s;tant terror, yet con&s;tant
darling of her &s;oul&mdash;where, and how, does &s;he &s;ee,
does &s;he meet thee again&mdash;O Camilla!&endq;</P>
<P>Then tenderly, though with angui&s;h, bending over
her, &s;he would have rai&s;ed, and helped her to return
to the bed: but Camilla would not be aided; &s;he
would not lift up her eyes; her face &s;ought the
ground, where leaning it upon her hands, without
de&s;iring to &s;peak, without wi&s;hing to &s;tir, torn by
&s;elf-reproaches that made her deem her&s;elf unworthy
to live, &s;he remained &s;peechle&s;s, immoveable.</P>
<P>&startq;Repre&s;s, repre&s;s,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold, gently,
yet firmly, &startq;the&s;e &s;trong feelings, u&s;ele&s;sly torturing
to us both. Rai&s;e your head, my poor girl&mdash;rai&s;e&mdash;
and repo&s;e it upon the brea&s;t of your Mother.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Of my Mother!&endq; repeated Camilla, in a voice
hardly audible; &startq;have I a Mother&mdash;who again will
own the bla&s;t of her hopes and happine&s;s?&mdash;the di&s;|grace,
the &s;hame of the be&s;t and mo&s;t injured of
Fathers!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let us pray,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold, with a &s;igh,
&startq;that the&s;e evils may pa&s;s away, and by &s;alutary
exertions, not de&s;ponding repinings, earn back our
fugitive peace.&endq;</P>
<P>Again &s;he then would have rai&s;ed her; but Ca|milla
&s;unk from all a&s;&s;i&s;tance: &startq;No,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;I
<PB N="316" REF="143">
am unworthy your lenity&mdash;I am unable even to
bear it.&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Camilla,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold, &s;teadily, &startq;it is
time to conquer this impetuous &s;en&s;ibility, which
already, in its effects, has nearly broken all our
hearts. With what horror have we mi&s;&s;ed&mdash;with
what agony &s;ought you! Now then, that at length
we find you, excite not new terror, by con&s;igning
your&s;elf to willing de&s;pair.&endq;</P>
<P>Struck with extreme dread of committing yet
further wrong, &s;he lifted up her head, with inten|tion
to have ri&s;en; but the weak &s;tate of her body,
forgotten by her&s;elf, and by Mrs. Tyrold un&s;u&s;|pected,
took its turn for demanding attention.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas! my poor Child,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;what
horrible havock has this &s;hort ab&s;ence produced!
O Camilla!&mdash;with a &s;oul of feeling like yours,
&mdash;&s;trong, tender, generous, and but too much
much alive, how is it you can thus have forgotten
the fir&s;t ties of your duty, and your heart, and
have been wrought upon by your own &s;orrows to
forget the &s;orrows you inflict? Why have you thus
fled us? thus abandoned your&s;elf to de&s;truction?
Was our anger to be &s;et in competition with our
mi&s;ery? Was the fear of di&s;plea&s;ure, from parents
who &s;o tenderly love you, to be indulged at the
ri&s;k of never ending regret to the mo&s;t lenient of
Fathers? and nearly the lo&s;s of &s;en&s;es to a Mother
who, from your birth, has idolized you in her
inmo&s;t &s;oul?&endq;</P>
<P>Bending then over her, &s;he folded her in her
arms; where Camilla, overpowered with the &s;trug|gles
of joy and contrition, &s;unk nearly lifele&s;s.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold, &s;eeing now her bodily feeblene&s;s,
put her to bed, with words of &s;oothing tender|ne&s;s,
no longer blended with retro&s;pective inve&s;ti|gation;
conjuring her to be calm, to remember
who&s;e peace and happine&s;s were encircled in her
life and health, and to remit to her fuller &s;trength
all further intere&s;ting di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="317" REF="144">
&startq;Ah! my Mother!&endq; cried Camilla, &startq;tell me
fir&s;t&mdash;if the time may ever come when with truth
you can forgive me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas, my darling chid!&endq; an&s;wered the gene|rous
Mother, &startq;I have my&s;elf now to pardon that
I forgave thee not at fir&s;t!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla &s;eemed tran&s;ported to another region;
with difficulty Mrs. Tyrold could hold her in her
bed, though hovering over her pillow with ince&s;&s;ant
care&s;&s;es: but to rai&s;e her eye only to meet that of
her Mother&mdash;not as her fertile terror had prophe|&s;ied,
darting unrelenting ire, but &s;oftly &s;olicitous,
and exqui&s;itely kind; to feel one loved hand anxi|ou&s;ly
upon her forehead, and to glue her $wn lips
upon the other; to find fears that had made exi&s;t|ence
in&s;upportable, transformed into &s;ecurity that
rendered it delicious;&mdash;with a floating, uncertain,
yet irrepre&s;&s;ible hope, that to Edgar &s;he owed this
re&s;toration, cau&s;ed a revul&s;ion in all her feelings,
that &s;oon operated upon her frame&mdash;not, indeed,
with tranquillity, but with rapture approaching to
delirium:&mdash;when &s;uddenly, a heavy, lumbering
noi&s;e, appalled her. &startq;Ah, my Mother!&endq; &s;he
faintly cried, &startq;our beloved Eugenia!&mdash;that
noi&s;e&mdash;where&mdash;and how&mdash;is Eugenia?&mdash;The
wretched Mr. Bellamy is no more!&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold an&s;wered, &s;he was acquainted with
the whole dreadful bu&s;ine&s;s, and would relate it
in a &s;ea&s;on of more &s;erenity; but meanwhile, as
repo&s;e, &s;he well knew, never a&s;&s;ociated with &s;u&s;|pen&s;e,
&s;he &s;atisfied immediate anxiety, by a&s;&s;uranc|es
that Eugenia was &s;afe, and at Etherington.</P>
<P>This was a joy &s;carce inferior to that which &s;o
recently had tran&s;ported her: but Mrs. Tyrold,
gathering from the good Peggy, that &s;he had not
been in bed, nor &s;carce ta&s;ted food, &s;ince &s;he had
been at the half-way hou&s;e, refu&s;ed all particulars,
till &s;he had been refre&s;hed with nouri&s;hment and
re&s;t. The fir&s;t immediately was ordered, and im|mediately
taken; and Mrs. Tyrold, to propi$$ate
<PB N="318" REF="145">
the &s;econd, in&s;i&s;ted upon total &s;ilence, and pre|pared
to &s;it up with her all night.</P>
<P>Long as the extreme agitation of her &s;pirits
di&s;tanced
<HI>Tir'd Nature's &s;weet re&s;torer, balmy &s;leep,</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Young.</NOTE>
the change from &s;o much mi&s;ery to heart-felt peace
and joy, with the judicious nur&s;ing and re&s;toratives
devi&s;ed by Mrs. Tyrold, for her weak and half
fami&s;hed frame, made her &s;lumber, when at
length it arrived, la&s;t &s;o long that, though
broken by frequent &s;tarts, &s;he awoke not till late
the next morning.</P>
<P>Her eyes then opened upon a felicity that again
made her think her&s;elf in a new world. Her
Mother, leaning over her, was watching her
breath, with hands uplifted for her pre&s;ervation,
and looks of fondne&s;s which &s;eemed to mark that
her happine&s;s depended upon it's being granted;
but as &s;he rai&s;ed her&s;elf, to throw her arms around
the loved maternal neck, the &s;hadow of another
form, quickly, yet gently receding, &s;truck her
&s;ight;&mdash;&startq;Ah, Heaven!&endq; &s;he exclaimed, &startq;who
is that?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Will you be good,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold gently,
&startq;be tranquil, be compo&s;ed, and earn that I &s;hould
tell you who has been watching by you this hour?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla could not an&s;wer; certain, now, who it
mu&s;t be, her emotions became again uncontroula|ble;
her horror, her remor&s;e, her &s;elf-abhorrence
revived, and agonizingly exclaiming, &startq;'Tis my
Father!&mdash;O, where can I hide my head'&endq; She
&s;trove again to envelop her&s;elf with the bed|curtain
from all view.</P>
<P>&startq;Here&mdash;in his own arms&mdash;upon his own brea&s;t
you &s;hall hide it,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold, returning to
the bed-&s;ide, &startq;and all now &s;hall be forgotten, but
thankfulne&s;s that our afflictions &s;eem finding their
period.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="319" REF="146">
&startq;O my Father! my Father!&endq; cried Camilla,
forgetting her &s;ituation, in her de&s;ire to throw
her&s;elf at his feet, &startq;can you &s;peak to me thus,
after the woe&mdash;the di&s;grace I have brought upon
you?&mdash;I de&s;erve your malediction!&mdash;I expected
to be &s;hut out from your heart,&mdash;I thought my&s;elf
abandoned&mdash;I looked forward only in death to re|ceiving
your forgivene&s;s!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold held her &s;till, while her Father
now ble&s;&s;ed and embraced her, each uttering, in
the &s;ame moment, whatever was &s;ofte&s;t to con&s;ole
her: but all her quick feelings were re-awakened
beyond their power to appea&s;e them; her penitence
tortured, her very gratitude tore her to pieces:
&startq;O my Mother,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;how do you forbear
to &s;purn me? Can you think of what is pa&s;&s;ed,
and &s;till pronounce your pardon? Will you not
draw it back at the &s;ight of my injured Father?
Are you not tempted to think I de&s;erve eternal
bani&s;hment from you both?&mdash;and to repent that
you have not ordered it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, my deare&s;t Child, no! I lament only that
I took you not at once to your proper &s;ecurity&mdash;
to the&s;e arms, my Camilla, that now &s;o fondly in|fold
you! to this bo&s;om&mdash;my darling girl!&mdash;where
my heart beats your welcome!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You make me too&mdash;too happy! the change is
almo&s;t killing! my Mother&mdash;my deare&s;t Mother!
&mdash;I did not think you would permit me to ever
call you &s;o again! My Father I knew would par|don
me, for the chief &s;uffering was his own; but
even he, I never expected could look at me thus
benignly again! and hardly&mdash;hardly would he have
been tried, if the evil had been rever&s;ed!&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold exhorted her to &s;ilent compo&s;ure;
but finding her agitation overpower even her own
efforts, he &s;ummoned her to join him in &s;olemn
thanks for her re&s;toration.</P>
<P>Awfully, though mo&s;t gratefully impre&s;&s;ed by
&s;uch a call, &s;he checked her emotion, and devoutly
<PB N="320" REF="147">
obeyed: and the &s;hort but pious ceremony quieted
her nerves, and calmed her mind.</P>
<P>The gentle&s;t tranquillity then took place in her
brea&s;t, of the tumultuous joy which had fir&s;t
chaced her deadly affliction. The &s;oothing, how|ever
&s;erious turn, given by devotion to her changed
&s;en&s;ations, &s;oftened the acute exce&s;s of rapture
which mounted felicity nearly to agony. More
eloquent, as well as &s;afer than any &s;peech, was the
pau&s;e of deep gratitude, the &s;ilence of humble
prai&s;e, which en&s;ued. Camilla, in each hand held
one of each beloved Parent; alternately &s;he pre&s;&s;ed
them with grateful reverence to her lips, alter|nately
her eye &s;ought each revered countenance,
and received, in the beaming &s;ondne&s;s they emit|ted,
a benediction that was balm to every woe.</P>

<P>MR. Tyrold was &s;oon, by urgent claims, forced
to leave them; and Camilla, with &s;trong &s;ecret
anxiety to know if Edgar had cau&s;ed this ble&s;t
meeting, led to a general explanation upon pa&s;t
events.</P>
<P>And now, to her utter amazement, &s;he found
that her letter &s;ent by the labourer had never been
received.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold related, that &s;he had no &s;ooner
read the fir&s;t letter addre&s;&s;ed to her through Lavi|nia,
than, &s;oftened and affected, &s;he wrote an an|&s;wer
of the utmo&s;t kindne&s;s to Belfont; de&s;iring
Camilla to continue with her &s;i&s;ter till called for
by Mi&s;s Margland, in her return home from Mrs.
Macder&s;ey. The vi&s;it, meanwhile to Cleves, had
tran&s;pired through Jacob, and, much touched by,
yet much blaming her travelling thus alone, &s;he
<PB N="321" REF="148">
wrote to her a &s;econd time, charging her to remove
no more from Belfont without Mi&s;s Margland.
But, on the preceding morning, the fir&s;t letter had
been returned with a note from Eugenia, that her
&s;i&s;ter had &s;et out two days before for Ethe$ington.</P>
<P>The moment of this intelligence, was the mo&s;t
dreadful to Mr. Tyrold and her&s;elf of their lives.
Every &s;pecies of conjecture was horrible. He &s;et
out in&s;tantly for Belfont, determining to make
enquiries at every inn, hou&s;e, and cottage, by the
way; but by taking, unfortunately, the road through
Alton, he had mi&s;&s;ed the half-way hou&s;e. In the
evening, while, with apprehen&s;ions &s;urpa&s;&s;ing all
de&s;cription, &s;he was waiting &s;ome news, a chai&s;e
drove up to the door. She &s;lew out, but &s;aw in
it&mdash;alone, cold, trembling, and &s;carce in he:
&s;en&s;es, Eugenia. In&s;tantly imagining &s;he came
with tidings of fatal tendency concerning Camilla,
&s;he &s;tarted back, exclaiming, &startq;All then, is over?&endq;
The chai&s;e-door had been opened; but Eugenia,
&s;haking too violently to get out; only, and faintly,
an&s;wered, &startq;Yes! my Mother&mdash;all is over!&mdash;&endq;
The mi&s;take was almo&s;t in&s;tantaneous death to
her&mdash;though the next words of Eugenia cleared it
up, and led to her own dreadful narrative.</P>
<P>Bellamy, as &s;oon as Camilla had left Belfont,
had made a peremptory demand that his wife &s;hould
claim, as if for &s;ome purpo&s;e of her own, a large
&s;um of Sir Hugh. Her &s;teady re&s;i&s;tance &s;ent him from
the hou&s;e in a rage; and &s;he &s;aw no more of him
till that day at noon, when he returned in a deep|er,
blacker wrath than &s;he had ever yet &s;een; and
vowed that nothing le&s;s than her going in per&s;on
to her uncle with his reque&s;t, &s;hould induce him
ever to forgive her. When he found her re&s;olute
in refu&s;al, he ordered a chai&s;e, and made her get
into it, without &s;aying for what purpo&s;e. She &s;aw
they were travelling towards Cleves, but he did
not once &s;peak, except where they changed hor&s;es,
till they came upon the cro&s;s-road, leading to the
half-way hou&s;e. Suddenly then, bidding the
<PB N="322" REF="149">
po&s;tillion &s;top at the end of a lane, he told him he
was going to look at a little farm, and, ordering
him to wait, made her alight and walk down it till
they were out of &s;ight of the man and the carri|age.
Fiercely, then &s;topping &s;hort, &startq;Will you
give me,&endq; he cried, &startq;your promi&s;e, upon oath,
that you will a&s;k your Uncle for the money?&endq;
&startq;Indeed, Mr. Bellamy, I cannot!&endq; &s;he an&s;wered.
&startq;Enough!&endq; he cried, and took from his pocket
a pi&s;tol. &startq;Good Heaven,&endq; &s;he &s;aid, &startq;you will
not murder me?&endq;&mdash;&startq;I cannot live without the
money my&s;elf,&endq; he an&s;wered, &startq;and why &s;hould I
let you?&endq; He then felt in his wai&s;$coat pocket,
whence he took two bullets, telling her, &s;he &s;hould
have the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing him load the pi&s;tol;
and that when one bullet had di&s;patched her, the
other &s;hould di&s;appoint the executioner. Horror
now conquered her, and &s;he &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to
a&s;k whatever he dictated. &startq;I mu&s;t hold the pi&s;tol
to your ear,&endq; cried he, &startq;while you take your
oath. See! 'tis loaded&mdash;This is no child's play.&endq;
He then lifted it up; but, at the &s;ame moment,
a di&s;tant voice exclaimed, &startq;Hold villain! or you
are a dead man!&endq; Starting, and meaning to hide
it within his wai&s;tcoat, his hand &s;hook&mdash;the pi&s;tol
went off&mdash;it &s;hot him through the body, and he
dropt down dead. Without &s;en&s;e or motion, &s;he
fell by his &s;ide; and upon recovering found her&s;elf
again in the chai&s;e. The po&s;tillion, who knew
her, had carried her thither, and brought her on
to Etherington. She then conjured that proper
per&s;ons might go back with the driver, and that
her Father would have the benevolence to &s;uper|intend
all that could be done that would be mo&s;t
re&s;pectfully decent.</P>
<P>The po&s;tillion acknowledged that it was him&s;elf
who had cried, Hold villain! A &s;u&s;picion of &s;ome
mi&s;chief had occured to him from &s;eeing the end
of a pi&s;tol jerk from the pocket of the gentleman,
as he got out of the chai&s;e; and begging a man,
who accidentally pa&s;&s;ed while he waited, to watch
<PB N="323" REF="150">
his hor&s;es, he ran down a field by the &s;ide of the
lane, whence he heard the words: &startq;The pi&s;tol is
loaded, and for no child's play!&endq; upon which,
&s;eeing it rai&s;ed, and the young Lady &s;hrink, he
called out. Yet Eugenia prote&s;ted her&s;elf con|vinced
that Bellamy had no real de&s;ign again&s;t
either his own life or her's, though terror, at the
moment, had conquered her: he had meant but to
affright her into con&s;ent, knowing well her word
once given, with whatever violence torn from
her, would be held &s;acred. The re&s;t was dreadful
accident, or Providence in that form playing upon
him&s;elf his own toils. The pious young Widow
was &s;o mi&s;erable at this &s;hocking exit, and the
&s;hocking manner in which the remains were left
expo&s;ed, that her Mother had &s;et out her&s;elf to
give orders in per&s;on, from the half-way hou&s;e,
for bringing thither the body, till Mr. Tyrold
could give his own directions. She found, how|ever,
that bu&s;ine&s;s already done. The man called
by the po&s;tillion had been joined by a party of la|bourers,
ju&s;t leaving off work; tho&s;e had gathered
others; they had procured &s;ome broad planks
which &s;erved for a bier, and had humanely con|veyed
the body to the inn, where the landlord was
a&s;&s;ured the po&s;tillion would come back with &s;ome
account of him, though little Peggy had only
learnt in general that he had been found murdered
near a wood.</P>
<P>&startq;Eugenia is ju&s;t now,&endq; &s;aid Mrs. Tyrold in
conclu&s;ion, &startq;plunged into an aby&s;s of ideas,
frightful to her humanity, and oppre&s;&s;ive to the
tenderne&s;s of her heart. Her nature is too noble
to rejoice in a relea&s;e to her&s;elf, worked by means
&s;o horrible, and big with notions of retribution
for the wretched culprit, at which even vengeance
the mo&s;t implacable might &s;hudder. Neverthele&s;s,
all will imperceptibly pa&s;s away, &s;ave the pity in|herent
in all good minds for vice and its penalties.
To know his abrupt puni&s;hment, and not to be
&s;hocked, would be inhuman; but to grieve with
<PB N="324" REF="151">
any regard for a man of &s;uch principles and conduct
would be an outrage to all that they have injured and
offended.&endq;</P>
<P>This view of the tran&s;action, by better reconciling
Camilla to the ultimate lot of her &s;i&s;ter, brought her back
to reflect upon her own. Still &s;he had not gathered with
preci&s;ion how &s;he had been di&s;covered. To pronounce
the name of Edgar was impo&s;&s;ible; but after a long
pau&s;e, which Mrs. Tyrold had hoped was given again
to repo&s;e, &s;he ventured to &s;ay, &startq;I have not yet
heard, my deare&s;t Mother, to what benign chance I
immediately owe my pre&s;ent un&s;peakable, unmerited
happine&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold looked at her a moment in &s;ilence, as
if to read what her que&s;tion offered beyond its mere
words: but &s;he &s;aw her eye ha&s;tily withdrawn from
the examination, and her cheeks &s;uddenly invelloped
with the bed cloaths.</P>
<P>Quietly, and without turning towards her again,
&s;he re&s;umed her narrative.</P>
<P>&startq;I engaged the worthy po&s;tillion of my poor Eu|genia
to drive me, purpo&s;ing to &s;end Ambro&s;e on with
him, while I waited at the half-way hou&s;e: but,
about two miles off, Ambro&s;e, who rode before, was
&s;topt by a gentleman, whom he met in a po&s;t chai&s;e;
when I came up to him, I &s;topt al&s;o. It was Mr.
Mandlebert.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who had looked up, now again ha&s;tily
drew back, and Mrs Tyrold, after a &s;hort pau&s;e, went
on.</P>
<P>&startq;His intelligence, of cour&s;e, fini&s;hed my &s;earch.
My fir&s;t idea was to convey you in&s;tantly home; but
the particulars I gathered made me fear removing
you. When I entered your room, you were a&s;leep;&mdash;
I dreaded to &s;urpri&s;e, yet could not refrain taking a
view of you, and while I looked, you &s;uddenly
awoke.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah!&endq; thought Camilla, 'tis to Edgar, then, that
ultimately I owe this ble&s;t moment!</P>
<P>&startq;But my Father,&endq; &s;he cried, my deare&s;t Mother,
&mdash;how came my dear Father to know where you had
found me?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="325" REF="152">
&startq;At Belfont he learnt the way you had &s;et out,
and that Eugenia and Bellamy were from home; and&punc;
without lo&s;s of time&mdash;regardle&s;s of the night and
of fa&s;ting,&mdash;he returned by a route through which
he traced you at every inn where you had changed
hor&s;es. He, al&s;o, entered as you were &s;leeping&mdash;and
we watched together by your &s;ide.&endq;</P>
<P>Again &s;ilial gratitude &s;ilenced all but it&s;elf, and
&s;leep, the &s;ofte&s;t &s;he had known for many months, &s;oon
gave to oblivion every care in Camilla.</P>
<P>The changeful tide of mental &s;pirits from mi&s;ery to
enjoyment, is not more rapid than the tran&s;ition from
per&s;onal danger to &s;afety, in the ela&s;tic period of
youth. 'Tis the epoch of extremes; and moderation,
by which alone we learn the true u&s;e of our ble&s;&s;ings,
is a wi&s;dom we are frequently only taught to appre|ciate
when redundance no longer requires its practice.</P>
<P>Camilla, from &s;orrow the mo&s;t de&s;olate, bounded
to joy that refu&s;ed a &s;olicitude; and from an illne&s;s
that held her &s;u&s;pended between delirium and di&s;&s;olu|tion,
to ca&s;e that had no complaint. The &s;ufferings
which had deprived her of the benefit of the re&s;t and
nouri&s;hment were no &s;ooner removed, than &s;he appeared
to be at once re&s;tored to health; though to repair the
wa&s;tes of &s;trength &s;ome time yet was nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold determined to carry her this afternoon
to Etherington. The remains of the wretched Bella|my,
in a c$ffin and hear&s;e brought from Winche&s;ter,
had been &s;ent to Belfont in the morning: and Mr.
Tyrold had followed, to give every direction that he
&s;hould be buried as the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e; without
reference to the conduct which had forfeited all &s;uch
re&s;pect.</P>
<P>Though the evil committed by the non-deliverence of
Camilla's letter was now pa&s;&s;ed all remedy, Mrs. Ty|rold
thought it every way right to endeavour to di&s;cover
where laid the blame; and by the two u&s;ual modes of
menace and promi&s;es, &s;he learnt that the countryman,
when he &s;topt to drink by the way, had in lighting
his pipe, let the letter take fire; and fearing to lo&s;e
the recompen&s;e he had expected, had &s;et his con&s;cience
<PB N="326" REF="153">
apart for a crown, and returned with the eventful
$al&s;ehood, which had made Camilla think her&s;elf
abandoned, and her friends deplore as her as lo&s;t.</P>
<P>For the benefit of tho&s;e with whom, in future, he
might have to deal, Mrs. Tyrold took &s;ome pains to
repre&s;ent to him the cruel evils his di&s;hone&s;ty had pro|duced;
but, &s;tupid rather than wicked, what he had
done had been without weighing right from wrong,
and what he heard was without under&s;tanding it.</P>
<P>Camilla found with extreme &s;atisfaction, that Mrs.
Tyrold, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trictne&s;s of the pre&s;ent
family oeconomy, meant liberally to recompen&s;e Mrs.
Marl, for the trouble and patience with which &s;he had
attended to a gue&s;t &s;o little profitable: while Peggy,
to who&s;e grateful remembrance &s;he owed the con&s;i|deration
&s;he had met with in her de&s;erted condition,
was rewarded by a much larger &s;um than &s;he had ever
before po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Camilla was obliged to confe&s;s &s;he
had parted with two pledges for future payment: the
watch was reclaimed without difficulty; but &s;he &s;hew|ed
&s;o much di&s;tre&s;s in naming the locket, that Mrs.
Tyrold, though &s;he looked anxiou&s;ly &s;urpri&s;ed, de|manded
it without enquiring into its hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>The exce&s;s of delight to Camilla in preparing to
return to Etherington, rendered her in&s;en&s;ible to all
fatigue, till &s;he was de&s;cending the &s;tairs; when the
recollection of the &s;hock &s;he had received from the
corp&s;e of Bellamy, made her tremble &s;o exceedingly,
that &s;he could &s;carce walk pa&s;t the door of the room
in which it had been laid. &startq;Ah, my deare&s;t Mo|ther,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;this hou&s;e mu&s;t give me always
the mo&s;t penetrating &s;en&s;ations: I have experienced in
it the deepe&s;t grief, and the mo&s;t heart-&s;oothing enjoy|ment
that ever, perhaps, gave place one to the other
in &s;o &s;hort a time!&endq;</P>
<P>Ambro&s;e had announced their intended arrival, and
at the door of the hou&s;e, the timid, but affectionate
Lavinia was waiting to receive them; and as Camilla,
in alighting, met her tender embraces, a well-known
<PB N="327" REF="154">
voice reached her ears, calling out in hurried accents,
&startq;Where is &s;he? Is &s;he come indeed? Are you quite
&s;ure?&endq; And Sir Hugh, hobbling rather than walking
into the hall, &s;olded her in his feeble arms, &s;obbing
over her: &startq;I can't believe it for joy! Poor &s;inner
that I am, and the cau&s;e of all our bad doings! how
can I have de&s;erved &s;uch a thing as this, to have my
own little Girl come back to me? which could not
have made my heart gladder, if I had had no &s;hare in
all this bad mi&s;chief! which, God knows I've had
enough, owing to my poor head doing always for the
wor&s;t, for all my being the olde&s;t of us all; which is
a thing I've often thought remarkable enough, in the
point of my knowing no better; which however, I
hope my dear little Darling will excu&s;e for the &s;ake of
my love, which is never happy but in &s;eeing her.&endq;</P>
<P>The heart of Camilla bounded with grateful joy at
&s;ight of this dear Uncle, and at &s;o tender a reception:
and while with equal emotion, and equal weakne&s;s,
they were unable to &s;upport either each other or them|&s;elves,
the worthy old Jacob, his eyes running over,
came to help his Ma&s;ter back to the parlour, and Mrs.
Tyrold and Lavinia conveyed thither Camilla: who
was but ju&s;t placed upon a &s;ofa, by the &s;ide of her
fond Uncle, when the door of an inner apartment was
&s;oftly opened, and pale, wan, and meagre, Eugenia
appeared at it, &s;aying, as faintly, yet with open arms,
&s;he advanced to Camilla: &startq;Let me too&mdash;your poor
harra&s;&s;ed, but half-alive Eugenia, make one in this
precious &s;cene! Let me &s;ee the joy of my kind Uncle
&mdash;the revival of my honoured Mother, the happine&s;s
of my dear Lavinia&mdash;and feel even my own heart beat
once more with delight in the bo&s;om of its darling
Si&s;ter!&mdash;my &s;o mourned&mdash;but now for ever, I tru&s;t,
re&s;tored to me, mo&s;t dear Camilla!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, thus encircled in her Mother's, Uncle's,
Si&s;ter's, arms at once, ga&s;ped, &s;ighed, &s;miled, and
&s;hed tears in the &s;ame grateful minute, while fondly
&s;he &s;trove to articulate, &startq;Am I again at Etherington
and at Cleves in one? And thus indulgently re|ceived?
thus more than forgiven? My heart wants
<PB N="328" REF="155">
room for its joy! my Mother! my Si&s;ters! if you
knew what de&s;pair has been my portion! I feared even
the &s;ight of my dear Uncle him&s;elf, le&s;t the &s;orrows
and the errors of a creature he &s;o kindly loved, &s;hould
have demoli&s;hed his generous heart!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Mine, my deare&s;t little Girl?&endq; cried the Baro|net,
&startq;why what would that have &s;ignified, in com|pari&s;on
to &s;uch a young one as yours, that ought to
know no &s;orrow yet a while? God knows, it being
time enough to begin: for it is but melancholy at be&s;t,
the cares of the world; which if you can't keep off
now, will be overtaking you at every turn.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Tyrold entreated Camilla might be &s;pared
further conver&s;ation. Eugenia had already glided back
to her chamber, and begged, this one &s;olacing inter|view
over, to be di&s;pen&s;ed with from joining the
family at pre&s;ent; Camilla was removed al&s;o to her
chamber; and the tender Mother divided her time and
her cares between the&s;e two recovered trea&s;ures of her
fonde&s;t affection.</P>

<P>MR. Tyrold did not return till the next day from
Belfont, where, through the account he gave from
his Daughter, the violent exit of the mi&s;erable Be&s;la|my
was brought in accidental death. Various circum|&s;tances
had now acquainted him with the hi&s;tory of
that wretched man, who was the younger &s;on of the
ma&s;ter of a great gaming-hou&s;e. In his fir&s;t youth,
he had been utterly neglected, and left to run wild
whither he cho&s;e; but his father afterwards becoming
very rich, had be&s;towed upon him as good an educa|tion
as the late period at which it was begun could
allow. He was intended for a. lucrative bu&s;ine&s;s;
but he had no application, and could retain no po&s;t:
<PB N="329" REF="156">
he went into the army; but he had no courage, and
was &s;peedily ca&s;hiered. Inheriting a pa&s;&s;ion for the
means by which the parental fortune had been rai&s;ed,
he devoted him&s;elf next to its pur&s;uit, and won very
largely. But as extravagance and good luck, by long
cu&s;tom, go hand in hand, he &s;pent as fa&s;t as he ac|quired;
and upon a tide of fortune in his disfavour,
was tempted to rever&s;e chances by unfair play, was
found out, and as ignominiou&s;ly chaced from the field
of hazard as from that of patrioti&s;m. His father was
no more; his elde&s;t brother would not a&s;&s;i&s;t him; he
&s;old therefore his hou&s;e, and all he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed but his
wardrobe, and, relying upon a very uncommonly
hand&s;ome face and per&s;on, determined to &s;eek a fairer.
lot, by eloping, if po&s;&s;ible, and with &s;ome heire&s;s
He thought it however prudent not only to retire
from London, but make a little change in his name,
which from Nicholas Gwigg he refined into Alphon&s;o
Bellamy. He began his career by a tour into Wales;
where he in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the acquaintance of
Mrs. Ecton, ju&s;t after &s;he had married Mi&s;s Melmond
to Mr. Berlinton: and though this was not an inter|cour&s;e
that could travel to Gretna-green, the beauty
and romantic turn of the bride of &s;o di&s;proportioned a
marriage, opened to his unprincipled mind a &s;cheme
yet more flagi$ious. Fortunately, however, for his
fair deffined prey, &s;oon after the connexion was form|ed,
&s;he left Wales; and the &s;earch of new adventures
carried him, by various chances, into Hamp&s;hire.
But he had e&s;tabli&s;hed with her, a corre&s;pondence,
and when he had caught, or rather $orced, an heire&s;s
into legal &s;hares, the di&s;covery of who and what he
was, became le&s;s important, and he ventured again
to town, and renewed his heinous plan, as well as his
inveterate early habits; till &s;urpri&s;ed by &s;ome unplea|&s;ant
recollectors, debts of honour, which he had found
it convenient to elude upon leaving the Capital, were
claimed, and found it impo&s;&s;ible to appear without
&s;atisfying &s;uch demands. Thence his cruel and inor|dinate
per&s;ecution of his unhappy wife for money:
<PB N="330" REF="157">
and thence, ultimately, the brief vengeance which
had reverberated upon his own head.</P>
<P>Camilla, who&s;e danger was the re&s;ult of &s;elf|neglect,
as her &s;ufferings had all flowed from mental
angui&s;h, was already able to go down to the &s;tudy
upon the arrival of Mr. Tyrold: where &s;he received,
with grateful rapture, the tender ble&s;&s;ings which wel|comed
her to the paternal arms&mdash;to her home&mdash;to
peace&mdash;to &s;afety&mdash;and primaeval joy.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, &s;paring to her yet weak nerves any
immediate explanations upon the pa&s;t, called upon
his wife to aid him to communicate, in the quiete&s;t
manner, what had been done at Belfont to Eugenia;
charging Camilla to take no part in a &s;cene inevitably
&s;hocking.</P>
<P>Once more in the appropriate apartment of her Fa|ther,
where all her earlie&s;t &s;cenes of gaye&s;t felicity
had pa&s;&s;ed, but which, of late, &s;he had only ap|proached
with terror, only entered to weep, &s;he ex|perienced
a delight almo&s;t awful in the renovation of
her pri&s;tine con&s;idence, and fearle&s;s ea&s;e. She took
from her pocket&mdash;where alone &s;he could ever bear to
keep it&mdash;her loved locket, delighting to attribute to
it this re&s;toration to dome&s;tic enjoyment; though
feeling at the &s;ame time, a renewal of &s;u&s;pence from
the return of its donor, and from the affecting inter|view
into which &s;he had been &s;urpri&s;ed, that broke in
upon even her filial happine&s;s, with bitter, tyrannical
regret. Yet &s;he pre&s;&s;ed to her bo&s;om the cheri&s;hed
&s;ymbol of fir&s;t regard, and was holding it to her lips,
when Mrs. Tyrold, unexpectedly, re-entered the room.</P>
<P>In extreme confu&s;ion, &s;he &s;hut it into its &s;hagreen
ca&s;e, and was going to re&s;tore it to her pocket; but
infolding it, with her daughter's hand, between each
of her own, Mrs. Tyrold &s;aid, &startq;Shall I ever, my
dear girl, learn the hi&s;tory of this locket?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O yes, my deare&s;t Mother,&endq; &s;aid the blu&s;hing
Camilla, &startq;of that&mdash;and of every&mdash;and of all things
&mdash;you have only&mdash;you have merely&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="331" REF="158">
&startq;If it di&s;tre&s;&s;es you, my dear child, we will leave
it to another day,&endq; &s;aid Mrs Tyrold, who&s;e eyes
Camilla &s;aw, as &s;he now rai&s;ed her own, were &s;wim|ming
in tears.</P>
<P>&startq;My Mother! my deare&s;t Mother!&endq; cried &s;he,
with the tendere&s;t alarm, &startq;has any thing new hap|pened?
&mdash;Is Eugenia greatly affected?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She is all every way, and in every re&s;pect,&endq; &s;aid
Mrs. Tyrold, &startq;whatever the fonde&s;t, or even the
proude&s;t-Mother could wi&s;h. But I do not at this
in&s;tant mo&s;t think of her. I am not with &s;ome fears
for my Camilla's &s;trength, in the immediate demand
that may be made upon her fortitude. Tell me, my
child, with that &s;incerity which &s;o long has been
mutually endearing between us, tell me if you think
you can &s;ee here, again, and as u&s;ual, without any
ri&s;k to your health, one long admitted and welcomed
as a part of the family?&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;tarted, changed colour, looked up, ca&s;t her
eyes on the floor; but &s;oon &s;eeing Mrs. Tyrold hold
an hankerchief bathed in tears to her face, lo&s;t all
$span$,
and throwing her arms round her neck, &startq;O my Mo|the,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;you who weep not for your&s;elf&mdash;
&s;carcely even in the mo&s;t poignant &s;orrow&mdash;can you
weep for me?&mdash;I will &s;ee&mdash;or I will avoid whoever
you plea&s;e&mdash;I &s;hall want no &s;ortitude,&mdash;I &s;hall fear
nothing&mdash;no one&mdash;not even my&s;elf&mdash;now again under
your protection! I will &s;carcely even think, my be|loved
Mother, but by your guidance!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Compo&s;e your&s;elf, then, my deare&s;t girl: and,
if you believe you are equal to behaving with firmne&s;s,
I will not refu&s;e his reque&s;t of re-admi&s;&s;ion.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;His reque&s;t?&endq; repeated Camilla, with involun|tary
quickne&s;s; but finding Mrs. Tyrold did not no|tice
it, gently adding, &startq;That per&s;on that&mdash;I believe
&mdash;you mean&mdash;has done nothing, my dear Mother, to
merit expul&s;ion!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I am happy to hear you &s;ay &s;o: I have been
&s;earfully, I mu&s;t own, and even piercingly di&s;plea&s;ed
with him.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="332" REF="159">
&startq;Ah, my dear Mother! how kind was the parti|ality
that turned your di&s;plea&s;ure &s;o wrong a way!

to your fondne&s;s rather than to your ju&s;tice!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>She trembled at the temerity of this vindication the
moment it had e&s;caped her, and looking another way,
&s;poke again of Eugenia: but Mrs. Tyrold now, tak|ing
both her hands, and &s;eeking, though vainly, to
meet her eyes, &s;aid, &startq;My deare&s;t child, I grow
painfully anxious to end a thou&s;and doubts; to &s;peak
and to hear with no further ambiguity, nor re&s;erve.

<P>Camilla again changed colour, and &s;trove to with|draw
her hands.</P>
<P>&startq;Take courage, my dear love, and let one final
explanation relieve us both at once. If Edgar has
merited well of you, why are you parted?&mdash;If ill&mdash;

&mdash;plead for me where I dare not now &s;peak&mdash;and rai&s;e
your indeed maternal eyes upon the happine&s;t&mdash;the mo&s;t
devoted of your family!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What is it overpowers me thus this morning?&endq;
cried Mrs. Tyrold, leaning her head upon her cling|ing
Camilla, while large drops fell from her eyes,
&startq;Misfortune, I &s;ee, is not the greate&s;t te&s;t of our
philo&s;ophy!&mdash;Joy, twice to day, has completely
demoli&s;hed mine!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What g$odne&s;s is this! what encouragement to
hope &s;ome indulgent interce&s;&s;ion here&mdash;where the &s;en&s;e
that now breaks in upon me of ungenerous&mdash;ever to
be lamented&mdash;and I had nearly &s;aid, execrated doubt,
fills me with &s;hame and regre&mdash;and makes me&mdash;even
at this &s;oft reviving, heart-re&s;toring moment, feel un|de&s;erving
my own hopes!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Shall I&mdash;may I leave him to make his
peace?&endq; whi&s;pered Mrs. Tyrold to her daughter,
who&s;e head &s;ought concealment even to annihilation;
but who&s;e arms, with what force they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, de|tained
<PB N="334" REF="161">
her, uttering faintly but rapidly, &startq;O no,
no, no!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My more than Mother!&endq; again cried Edgar,
&startq;I will wait till that felicity may be accorded me,
and put my&s;elf wholly under your kind and powerful
influence. One thing alone I mu&s;t &s;ay;&mdash;I have too
much to an&s;wer for, to take any &s;hare of the mi&s;de|meanors
of another!&mdash;I have not been a treacherous
li&s;tener, though a wilful obtruder,&mdash;See, Mrs.
Tyrold! who placed me in that room&mdash;who is the
accomplice of my happine&s;s!&endq;</P>
<P>With a &s;mile that &s;eemed to beam but the more
brightly for her gli&s;tening eyes, Mrs. Tyrold looked
to the door, and &s;aw there, leaning again&s;t it, the
form &s;he mo&s;t revered; &s;urveying them all with an
expre&s;&s;ion of &s;atisfaction &s;o perfect, contentment &s;o
benign, and plea&s;ure mingled with &s;o much thankful|ne&s;s,
that her tears now flowed fa&s;t from unre&s;trained
delight; and Mr. Tyrold, approaching to pre&s;s at once
the two objects of his mo&s;t exqui&s;ite tenderne&s;s to his
brea&s;t, &s;aid, &startq;This &s;urpri&s;e was not planned, but
circum&s;tances made it more than irre&s;i&s;tible. It was
not, however, quite fair to my Camilla, and if &s;he
is angry, we will be &s;elf-exiled till &s;he can pardon
us.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This is &s;uch a dream,&endq;&mdash;cried Camilla, as now,
fir&s;t, from the voice of her Father &s;he believed it rea|lity;
&startq;&s;o incredible&mdash;&s;o unintelligible&mdash;I
find it entirely&mdash;impo&s;&s;ible&mdash;impo&s;&s;ible to com|prehend
any thing I &s;ee or hear!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Let the pa&s;t,&mdash;not the pre&s;ent,&endq; cried Edgar,
&startq;be regarded as the dream! and generou&s;ly drive it
from your mind as a fever of the brain, with which
rea&s;on had no &s;hare, and for which memory mu&s;t find
no place.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If I could under&s;tand in the lea&s;t,&endq; &s;aid Camilla,
&startq;what this all means&mdash;what&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now in&s;i&s;ted that Edgar &s;hould retreat,
while he made &s;ome explanation; and then related to
his trembling, doubting&punc; wondering daughter, the
following circum&s;tances.</P>
<P><PB N="335" REF="162">
In returning from Belfont, he had &s;topt at the
half-way-hou&s;e, where he had received from Mrs.
Marl, a letter that, had it reached him as it was in|tended,
at Etherington, would have quickened the
general meeting, yet nearly have broken his heart. It
was that which, for want of a me&s;&s;enger, had never
been &s;ent, and which Peggy, in cleaning the bed|room,
had found under a table, where it had fallen,
&s;he &s;uppo&s;es, when the candle was put upon it for
reading prayers.</P>
<P>&startq;There was another letter, too!&endq; interrupted
Camilla, with quick blu&s;hing recollection;&mdash;&startq;but
my illne&s;s&mdash;and all that has followed, made me
forget them both till this very moment&mdash;Did &s;he
&s;ay any thing of any&mdash;other?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes;&mdash;the other had been delivered accord|ing
to its addre&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Good Heavens?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Be not frightened, my Camilla,&mdash;all has
been beautifully directed for the be&s;t. My accomplice
had received his early in the morning; he was at the
hou&s;e, by &s;ome fortunate hazard when it was found,
and, being well known there, Mrs. Marl gave it to
him immediately.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;How terrible!&mdash;It was meant only in ca&s;e
&mdash;I had &s;een no one any more!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;The intent, and the event, have been happily,
my child, at war. He came in&s;tantly hither, and en|quired
for me; I was not returned; he a&s;ked my
route, and rode to follow or meet me. About an
hour ago, we encountered upon the road: he gave
his hor&s;e to his groom, and came into the chai&s;e to
me.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now could with difficulty li&s;ten; but her
Father ha&s;tened to acquaint her, that Edgar, with the
mo&s;t generous apologies, the mo&s;t liberal &s;elf-blame,
had re-demanded his con&s;ent for a union, from which
every doubt was wholly, and even miraculou&s;ly re|moved,
by learning thus the true feelings of her heart,
as depicted at the awful cri&s;is of expected di&s;&s;olution.
The returning &s;miles which forced their way now
<PB N="336" REF="163">
through the tears and blu&s;hes of Camilla, &s;hewed
how vainly &s;he &s;trove to mingle the regret of
&s;hame with the felicity of &s;ond &s;ecurity, produced
by this eventful accident. But when &s;he further
heard that Edgar, in Flanders, had met with
Lionel, who, in frankly recounting his difficulties
and adventures, had named &s;ome circum&s;tances
which had &s;o &s;haken every opinion that had urged
him to quit England, as to induce him in&s;tantly,
from the conference, to &s;eek a pa&s;&s;age for his re|turn,
&s;he felt all but happine&s;s retire from her
heart;&mdash;vani&s;h even from her ideas.</P>
<P>&startq;You are not angry, then,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold,
as &s;milingly he read her delighted &s;en&s;ations, &startq;that
I waited not to con&s;ult you? That I gave back at
once my con&s;ent? That I folded him again in my
arms?&mdash;again&mdash;called him my &s;on?&endq;</P>
<P>She could but &s;eek the &s;ame pre&s;&s;ure; and he
continued, &startq;I would not bring him in with me;
I was not aware my dear girl was &s;o rapidly reco|vered,
and I had a ta&s;k to fulfil to my poor Euge|nia
that was &s;till my fir&s;t claim. But I promi&s;ed
within an hour, your Mother, at lea&s;t, &s;hould
welcome him. He would walk, he &s;aid, for that
period. When I met her, I hinted at what was
pa&s;&s;ing, and &s;he followed me to our Eugenia; I
then briefly communicated my adventure; and your
Mother, my Camilla, lo&s;t her&s;elf in hearing it!
Will you not,&mdash;like me!&mdash;withdraw from
her all reverence? Her eyes gu&s;hed with tears,&mdash;
&s;he wept, as you weep at this moment; &s;he was
&s;ure Edgar Mandlebert could alone pre&s;erve you
from danger, yet make you happy&mdash;Was &s;he
wrong, my dear child? Shall we attack now her
judgment, as well as her fortitude?&endq;</P>
<P>Only at her &s;eet could Camilla &s;hew her grati|tude;
to action &s;he had recour&s;e, for words were
inadequate, and the tendere&s;t care&s;&s;es now &s;poke
be&s;t for them all.</P>
<P>Re&s;pect for the &s;ituation of Eugenia, who had
de&s;ired, for this week, to live wholly up &s;tairs and
<PB N="337" REF="164">
alone, determined Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold to keep
back for &s;ome time the knowledge of this event
from the family. Camilla was mo&s;t happy to pay
&s;uch an attention to her &s;i&s;ter; but when Mr.
Tyrold was leaving her, to con&s;ult upon it with
Edgar, the ingenuou&s;ne&s;s of her nature urged her
irre&s;i&s;tibly to &s;ay, &startq;Since all this has pa&s;&s;ed, my
deare&s;t Father&mdash;my deare&s;t Mother&mdash;does it not
&s;eem as if I &s;hould now my&s;elf&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;topt; but &s;he was under&s;tood; they both
&s;miled, and Mr. Tyrold immediately bringing in
Edgar, &s;aid, &startq;I find my pardon, my dear fellow|culprit,
is already accorded; if you have doubts
of your own, try your eloquence for your&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>He left the room, and Mrs. Tyrold was gently
ri&s;ing to quietly follow, but Camilla, with a look
of entreaty of which &s;he knew the &s;incerity, and
would not re&s;i&s;t the earne&s;tne&s;s, detained her.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah yes, &s;tay, deare&s;t Madam!&endq; cried Edgar,
again re&s;pectfully taking her hand, &startq;and through
your unalterable goodne&s;s, let me hope to procure
pardon for a di&s;tru&s;t which I here for ever re|nounce;
but which had its origin in my never
daring to hope what, at this moment, I have the
felicity to believe. Yet now, even now, without
your kind mediation, this dear convale&s;cent may
plan &s;ome probationary trial at which my whole
mind, after this long &s;uffering, revolts. Will you
be my caution, my deare&s;t Mrs. Tyrold? Will
you venture&mdash;and will you deign to promi&s;e, that
if a full and generous forgivene&s;s may be pro|nounced
&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Forgivene&s;s?&endq; in a &s;oft voice interrupted Ca|milla:
&startq;Have I any thing to forgive? I thought
all apology&mdash;all explanation, re&s;ted on my part!
and that my imprudencies&mdash;my ra&s;hne&s;s&mdash;my &s;o
often-erring judgment&mdash;and &s;o apparently, al|mo&s;t
even culpable conduct&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;O, my Camilla! my now own Camilla!&endq;
cried Edgar, venturing to change the hand of the
Mother for that of the daughter; &startq;what too, too
<PB N="338" REF="165">
touching words and conce&s;&s;ions are the&s;e! Suffer
me, then, to hope a kind amne&s;ty may take place
of retro&s;pection, a clear, liberal, open forgivene&s;s
anticipate explanation and enquiry!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Are you &s;ure,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, &s;miling, &startq;this
is your intere&s;t, and not mine?&mdash;Does he not
make a mi&s;take, my deare&s;t Mother, and turn my
advocate, in&s;tead of his own? And can I fairly
take advantage of &s;uch an error?&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;un-&s;hine of her returning &s;miles went
warm to her Mother's heart, and gave a glow to
the cheeks of Edgar, and a brightne&s;s to his eyes
that irradiated his whole countenance. &startq;Your
penetrating judgment,&endq; &s;aid he to Mrs Tyrold,
&startq;will take in at once more than any profe&s;&s;ions,
any prote&s;tations can urge for me:&mdash;you &s;ee the
peace, the pardon which tho&s;e eyes do not &s;eek to
withhold&mdash;will you then venture, my more than
maternal friend! my Mother, in every meaning
which affection and reverence can give to that
revered appellation&mdash;will you venture at once&mdash;
now&mdash;upon this dear and ever after hallowed
minute&mdash;to &s;eal the kind con&s;ent of my truly
paternal guardian, and to give me an example of
that tru&s;t and confidence which my whole future
life &s;hall look upon as its le&s;&s;on?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes!&endq; an&s;wered Mrs. Tyrold, in&s;tantly join|ing
their hands, &startq;and with every &s;ecurity that the
happine&s;s of all our lives&mdash;my child's, my hu&s;|band's,
your's, my valued Edgar, and my own,
will all owe their felicity to the ble&s;&s;ing with which
I now lay my hands upon my two precious chil|dren!&endq;</P>
<P>Tears were the only language that could expre&s;s
the fulne&s;s of joy which &s;ucceeded to &s;o much
&s;orrow; and when Mr. Tyrold returned, and had
united his tendere&s;t benediction with that of his
beloved wi&s;e, Edgar was permitted to remain alone
with Camilla; and the clo&s;e of his long doubts,
and her own long perplexities, was a reciprocal
<PB N="339" REF="166">
confidence that left nothing untold, not an action
unrelated, not even a thought unacknowledged.</P>
<P>Edgar confe&s;&s;ed that he no &s;ooner had quitted
her, than he &s;u&s;pected the ju&s;tice of his deci&s;ion;
the turn which of late, he had taken, doubtfully
to watch her every action, and &s;u&s;piciou&s;ly to judge
her every motive, though it had impelled him in
her pre&s;ence, cea&s;ed to operate in her ab&s;ence.&mdash;
He was too noble to betray the well meant, though
not well applied warnings of Dr. Marchmont, yet
he acknowledged, that when left to cool reflection,
a thou&s;and palliations aro&s;e for every &s;tep he could
not po&s;itively vindicate: and when, afterwards,
from the frank communication of Lionel, he learnt
what belonged to the my&s;terious offer of Sir Sedley
Clarendel, that &s;he would &s;uperinted the di&s;po&s;al
of his fortune; and the deep obligation in which
&s;he had been innocently involved, his heart &s;mote
him for having judged 'ere he had inve&s;tigated
that tran&s;action; and in a perturbation un&s;peakable
of quick repentance, and tenderne&s;s, he &s;et out
for England. But when, at the half-way hou&s;e, he
&s;topt as u&s;ual to re&s;t his hor&s;es in his way to Beech
Park,&mdash;what were his emotions at the &s;ight of the
locket, which the landlady told him had been
pledged by a lady in di&s;tre&s;s! He be&s;ought her par|don
for the manner in which he had made way to
her; but the almo&s;t frantic anxiety which &s;eized
him to know if or not it was her, and to &s;ave her,
if &s;o, from the intended intru&s;ion of the landlord,
made him irre&s;i&s;tibly prefer it to the plainer mode
which he &s;hould have adopted with any one el&s;e,
of &s;ending in his name, and &s;ome me&s;&s;age. His
&s;hock at her view in &s;uch a &s;tate, he would not
now revive; but the impropriety of bidding the
landlady quit the chamber, and the impo&s;&s;ibility
of entering into an explanation in her hearing,
alone repre&s;&s;ed, at that agitated moment, the
avowal of every &s;en&s;ation with which his heart
was labouring. &startq;But when,&endq; he added, &startq;&s;hall I
cea&s;e to rejoice that I had li&s;tened to the good land|lady's
<PB N="340" REF="167">
hi&s;tory of a &s;ick gue&s;t, while all conjecture
was &s;o remote from whom it might be! when I am
tempted to turn a&s;ide front a tale of $word$, I will
recollect what I owe to having given one ear!&endq;
Lo&s;t in wonder at what could have brought her
to &s;uch a &s;ituation, and di&s;turbed how to pre&s;ent
him&s;elf at the rectory, till fixed in his plans, he
had ridden to the half-way hou&s;e that morning, to
enquire concerning the corp&s;e that Mrs. Marl had
mentioned&mdash;and there&mdash;while he was &s;peaking with
her, the little maid brought down two letters&mdash;
one of them directed to him&s;elf.&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;What a rapid tran&s;ition,&endq; cried he, &startq;was then
mine, from regrets, that robbed life of all charms,
to pro&s;pects which paint it in its mo&s;t viv$d colours
of happine&s;s! from wavering the mo&s;t deplorable,
to re&s;olutions of expiating by a whole life of de|voted
fondne&s;s, the barbarous waywardne&s;s that
could deprive me, for one wilful moment, of the
exqui&s;ite felicity of my lot!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But &s;till,&endq; &s;aid Camilla, &startq;I do not quite un|der&s;tand
how you came in that room this morning?
and how you authorized your&s;elf to overhear my
confe&s;&s;ions to my Mother?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Recollect my acknowledged accomplice before
you hazard any blame! When I came hither&mdash;
&s;omewhat, I confe&s;s, within my given hour, Mr.
Tyrold received me him&s;elf at the door. He told
me I was too &s;oon, and took me into the front par|lour.
The partition is thin. I heard my name
&s;poken by Mrs. Tyrold, and the gentle voice of
my Camilla, in accents yet more gentle than even
that voice ever &s;poke before, an&s;wering &s;ome que&s;|tion;
I was not my&s;elf, at fir&s;t, aware of its te|nour
&mdash;but when, unavoidably, I gathered it&mdash;
when I heard words &s;o beautifully harmonizing
with what I had &s;o lately peru&s;ed&mdash;I would in|&s;tantly
have ventured into the room; but Mr.
Tyrold feared &s;urpri&s;ing you&mdash;you went on&mdash;my
fa&s;cinated &s;oul dive&s;ted me of obedience&mdash;of cau|tion&mdash;of
<PB N="341" REF="168">
all but joy and gratitude&mdash;and he could
no longer re&s;train me. And now with which of
her offenders will my Camilla quarrel?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;With neither, I believe, ju&s;t at pre&s;ent. The
con&s;piracy is &s;o complex, and even my Mother &s;o
nearly a party concerned, that I dare not ri&s;k the
unequal conte&s;t. I mu&s;t only, in future,&endq; added
&s;he, &s;imiling, &startq;&s;peak ill of you&mdash;and then you
will find le&s;s plea&s;ure in the thinne&s;s of a partition!&endq;</P>
<P>Faithfully &s;he returned his communication, by
the fulle&s;t, mo&s;t candid, and un&s;paring account of
every tran&s;action of her &s;hort life, from the &s;till
&s;horter period of its being put into voluntary mo|tion.
With nearly breathle&s;s intere&s;t, he li&s;tened
to the detail of her tran&s;actions with Sir Sedley
Clarendel, with pity to her debts, and with horror
to her difficulties. But when, through the whole
ingenuous narration, he found him&s;elf the con|&s;tant
object of every view, the ultimate motive to
every action, even where lea&s;t it appeared, his hap|pine&s;s,
and his gratitude, made Camilla &s;oon for|get
that &s;orrow had ever been known to her.</P>
<P>They then &s;poke of her two favourites Mrs.
Arlbery, and Mrs. Berlinton; and though &s;he was
animated in her prai&s;e of the good qualities of the
fir&s;t, and the &s;weet attraction of the la&s;t, &s;he
confe&s;&s;ed the danger, for one &s;o new in the
world, of chu&s;ing friends di&s;tinct from tho&s;e of
her family; and voluntarily promi&s;ed, during
her pre&s;ent &s;ea&s;on of inexperience, to repo&s;e the
future choice of her connections, where &s;he could
never be happy without their approvance.</P>
<P>The two hundred pounds to Sir Sedley Cla|rendel,
he determined, on the very day that
Camilla &s;hould be his, to return to the Baronet,
under the privilege, and in the name of paying
it for a brother.</P>
<P>In conference thus &s;oftly bal&s;amic to every
pa&s;t wound, and thus deliciou&s;ly opening to
that &s;ummit of earthly felicity&mdash;confidence unli|mited
<PB N="342" REF="169">
entwined around affection unbounded&mdash;
hours might have pa&s;&s;ed, unnumbered and un|awares,
had not prudence forced a &s;eparation, for
the repo&s;e of Camilla.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The la&s;t Touches of the Picture.</HEAD>
<P>LATE as Edgar quitted the rectory, he went
not &s;traight to Beech Park; every tie both of
friend&s;hip and propriety carried him fir&s;t to Dr.
Marchmont; who had too much feeling to won|der
at the power of his late incitements, and
too much goodne&s;s of heart not to felicitate
him upon their i&s;&s;ue, though he &s;ighed at the
recollection of the di&s;appointments whence his
own doubting coun&s;el originated. Twice be|trayed
in his deare&s;t expectations, he had form|ed
two criterions from his peculiar experience,
by which he had &s;ettled his opinion of the whole
female &s;ex; and where opinion may humour
&s;y&s;tematic prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, who &s;hall build&punc; upon his
virtue or wi&s;dom to guard the tran&s;parency of his
impartiality?</P>
<P>The following day, the We&s;twyns pre&s;ented
them&s;elves at Etherington; hurried from a tour
they were taking through Devon&s;hire and Corn|wall,
by intelligence which had reached them
that Sir Hugh Tyrold was ruined, and Cleves
was to be let. They met, by chance, with
Edgar alone in the parlour; and the joy of
the old gentleman in hearing how &s;mall a
part of the rumour was founded in fact, made
<PB N="343" REF="170">
him &s;hake hands with him as cordially for
&s;etting him right, as Edgar welcomed his kind|ne&s;s,
from the plea&s;ure afforded by the &s;ight
of &s;uch primitive regard. But when, pre&s;um|ing
upo$ his peculiar intimacy in the family,
as ward of Mr. Tyrold, though without yet daring
to avow his approaching nearer affinity, Edgar
in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;uperior claim for &s;upplanting
them in taking charge of the debt of his guardian;
Mr. We&s;twyn, almo&s;t angrily, prote&s;ted he would
let no man upon earth, let him be who&s;e ward he
plea&s;ed, &s;hew more re&s;pect than him&s;elf for the
brother of Sir Hugh Tyrold; &startq;and Hal thinks
the &s;ame too,&endq; he added, &startq;or he's no &s;on of mine.
And &s;o he'll &s;oon &s;hew you, in a way you can't
gue&s;s, I give you my word. At lea&s;t that's my
opinion.&endq;</P>
<P>He then took his &s;on apart, and abruptly
whi&s;pered to him, &startq;As that pretty girl you
and I took &s;uch a fancy to, at Southton,
&s;erved us in that &s;habby manner, becau&s;e of
meeting with that old Lord, it's my opinion
you'd do the right thing to take her &s;i&s;ter;
who's pretty near as pretty, and gives her&s;elf
no airs; and that will be &s;hewing re&s;pect for
my worthy old friend, now he's down in
the world; which is exactly that he did for
me when I was down my&s;elf. For if he
had not lent me that thou&s;and pounds I told
you of, when not a relation I had&punc; would
lend me a hundred, I might have been ruin|ed
before ever you were born. Come, tell
me your mind, Hal! off or on? don't &s;tand
&s;hilly &s;hally; i'ts what I can't bear; &s;peak
hone&s;tly; I won't have your choice controll|ed;
only this one thing I mu&s;t tell you

of you again as long as ever I live, if you

The appearance of Lavinia relieved the immediate
embarra&s;&s;ment of Henry, while the mode&s;t plea&s;ure
with which &s;he received them confirmed the partiality
of both. The eagerne&s;s, however, of the father,
admitted of no delay, and when Sir Hugh entered the
room, the &s;on's a&s;&s;ent being obtained, he warmly de|manded
the fair Lavinia for his daughter-in-law.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh received the propo&s;ition with the mo&s;t
copious &s;atisfaction; Mr. and Mrs. Tyrold with equal,
though more anxious delight; and Lavinia her&s;elf with
blu&s;hing but unaffected hopes of happine&s;s.</P>
<P>Whatever was known to Sir Hugh, no cautions,
nor even his own be&s;t de&s;igns, could &s;ave from being
known to the whole hou&s;e. Eugenia, therefore, was
unavoidably informed of this tran&s;action; and the
generous plea&s;ure with which &s;he revived from the
almo&s;t &s;ettled melancholy left upon her, by continual
misfortunes, ju&s;tified the impatience of Edgar to ac|cel$rate
the allowed period for publi&s;hing his own
happy hi&s;tory.</P>
<P>Eugenia wept with joy at tidings &s;o precious of her
belov$$ &s;i&s;ter, through whom, and her other dear
friends, &s;he was alone, &s;he &s;aid, &s;u&s;ceptible of joy,
though to all &s;orrow &s;he henceforth bid adieu, &startq;For
henceforth,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;I mean to regard my&s;elf as
if already I had pa&s;&s;ed the bu&s;y period of youth and of
life, and were only a &s;pectatre&s;s of others. For this
purpo&s;e, I have begun writing my memoirs, which

<P>&startq;No blooming coquette, elated with adulation and
triumphant with conque&s;t, here counts the glories
of her eyes, or enumerates the train of her adorers:
no beauteous prude, repines at the fatigue of ad|miration,
nor bewails the nece&s;&s;ity of tyranny: O
gentle reader! you have the &s;tory of one from
<PB N="345" REF="172">
whom fate has withheld all the delicacy of vanity,
all the regale of cruelty&mdash;!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Here,&endq; interrupted the young biographer, &startq;will
follow my portrait, and then this further addre&s;s
to my readers.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O ye, who, young and fair, revel in the attrac|tions
of beauty, and exult in the pride of admiration,
&s;ay, where is your envy of the heire&s;s to whom
fortune comes with &s;uch alloys? And which how|ever
di&s;tre&s;&s;ed or impoveri&s;hed, would accept my
income with my per&s;onal defects?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ye, too, O lords of the creation, mighty men!
impute not to native vanity the repining &s;pirit with
which I lament the lo&s;s of beauty; attribute not to
the innate weakne&s;s of my &s;ex, the concern I confe&s;s
for my deformity; nor to feminine littlene&s;s of
&s;oul, a regret of which the true &s;ource is to be
traced to your own bo&s;oms, and &s;prings from your
own ta&s;tes: for the value you your&s;elves &s;et upon
external attractions, your own neglect has taught
me to know; and the indifferency with which you
con&s;ider all el&s;e, your own duplicity has in&s;tructed
me to feel.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla &s;ought to di&s;&s;uade her from reflexions &s;o
afflictive, and retro&s;pections &s;o poignant; but they
aided her, &s;he &s;aid, in her ta&s;k of acquiring compo&s;ure
for the regulation of her future life.</P>
<P>Edgar now received permi&s;&s;ion to make his commu|nication
to the Baronet.</P>
<P>The joy with which Sir Hugh heard it, was for
&s;ome time over-clouded by doubt. &startq;My dear Mr.
young Edgar,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;in ca&s;e you don't know
your own mind yet, in the point of it's nor changing
again, as it did before, I'd as lieve you would not
tell me of it till you've taken the proper time to be at
a certainty; frettings about the&s;e ups and downs,
being what do no good to me, in point of the gout.&endq;</P>
<P>But when thoroughly re-a&s;&s;ured, &startq;Well,&endq; he
cried, &startq;this is ju&s;t the thing I &s;hould have cho&s;e
out of all our misfortunes, being what makes me
happier than ever I was in my life; except once be|fore
<PB N="346" REF="173">
on the very &s;ame account, which all turned out
to end in nothing: which I hope won't happen any
more: for now I've only to pay off all our debts, and
then I may go back again to Cleves, which I &s;hall be
glad enough to do, it being but an awkward thing to
a man, after he's pa&s;t boyhood, having no home of
his own.&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;igh at the recollection of the change in his &s;itu|ation,
&s;ince his plan was la&s;t agitated, checked his
&s;elicity, and depre&s;&s;ed even that of Edger, who, with
the mo&s;t tender earne&s;tne&s;s, be&s;ought his leave to
advance the &s;um requi&s;ite to return him tranquilly to
his man&s;ion; but who could not prevail, till Camilla
joined in the petition, and permitted Edgar, in both
their names to entreat, as their deare&s;t wi&s;h, that they
might be united, according to the fir&s;t arrangement,
from Cleves</P>
<P>This the Baronet could not re&s;i&s;t, and preparations
were rapidly made for re-in&s;tating him in his dwelling,
and for the double marriages de&s;tined to take place
upon his return.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then, this,&endq; cried he, as he poured upon them
his tendere&s;t ble&s;&s;ings and care&s;&s;es, &startq;is the odde&s;t of
all! My dear little Camilla, that I took all my fortune
from, is the very per&s;on to give me her's as &s;oon as
ever &s;he gets it! as well as my own hou&s;e over my
old head again, after my turning her, as one may
&s;ay, out of it! which is a thing as curious, in point
of us poor ignorant mortals, as if my brother had put
it in a &s;ermon.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Such turns in the tide of fortune,&endq; &s;aid Mr.
Tyrold, &startq;are among&s;t the happie&s;t le&s;&s;ons of huma|nity,
where tho&s;e who have &s;erved the humble and
helple&s;s from motives of pure di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s, find
they have made u&s;eful friends for them&s;elves, in the
perpetual vici&s;&s;itudes of our un&s;table condition.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, then, there's but one thing more, by what
I can make out,&endq; &s;aid the Baronet, &startq;that need be
much upon my mind, and that I've been thinking
&s;ome time about, in point of forming a &s;cheme to get
rid of, which I think I've got a pretty good one: for
<PB N="347" REF="174">
here's Lavinia going to be married to the very
olde&s;t friend I have in the world; that is, to his
&s;on, which is the &s;ame thing in point of bringing us
all together; and my own dear little girl, to the
be&s;t gentleman in the county, except for that one
thing of going off at the fir&s;t, which I dare &s;ay he did
not mean, for which rea&s;on I &s;hall mention it no
more: and Indiana, to one of tho&s;e young ap|tains,
that I can't pretend I know much of; but
that's very excu&s;able in &s;o young a per&s;on, not
having had much head from the beginning; which
I always make allowance for; my own not being
over extraordinary: and Eugenia, poor thing,
being a widow already; for which God be prai&s;ed;
which I hope is no &s;in, in point of the poor lad
that's gone not belonging to any of u$, by what I
can make out, except by his own doing whether
we would or not; which, however, is neither
here nor there, now he's gone; for Eugenia being
no beauty, and Clermont having as good as &s;aid &s;o,
I &s;uppo&s;e &s;he thought &s;he mu&s;t not be too difficult;
which is a thing young girls are apt to fall into;
and boys too, for the matter of that; for, by what
I can make out of life, I don't &s;ee but what a
&s;cholar thinks a girl had better be pretty than not,
as much as another man.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But what, my dear brother,&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold,
&startq;is your new di&s;tre&s;s and new &s;cheme?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why I can't &s;ay but what I'm a little put out,
that Indiana &s;hould forget poor Mrs. Margland,
in the particular of a&s;king her to go to live with
her; which, however I dare &s;ay &s;he can't help,
tho&s;e young captains commonly not over liking
having elderly per&s;ons about them; not that I
mean to gue&s;s her age, which I take to be fifty,
and upwards; which is no point of ours. But the
thing I'm thinking of is Dr. Orkborne, in the ca&s;e
of their marrying one another.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear brother!&mdash;has any &s;uch idea oc|curred
to them?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="348" REF="175">
&startq;Not as I know of; but Indiana having done
with one, and Eugenia with the other, and me,
Lord help me! not wanting either of them, why
what can I do if they won't? the Doctor's a&s;ked
to go to town, for the &s;ake of printing his papers,
which I begged him not to hurry, for I'm but lit|tle
fit for learning conver&s;ation ju&s;t now; though
when he's here, he commonly &s;ays nothing; only
taking out his tablets to write down &s;omething
that comes into his head, as I &s;uppo&s;e: which I
can't &s;ay is very entertaining in the light of a com|panion.
However, as to his having called me a
blockhead, it's not what I take umbrage at, not
being a wit being a fault of no man's, except of
nature, which nobody has a right to be angry at.
Be&s;ides, as to his having a little pride, it's what
I owe to him no ill-will for; a &s;cholar having
nothing el&s;e but his learning, is excu&s;able for
making the mo&s;t of it. However, if they would
marry one another, I can't but &s;ay I &s;hould take
it very well of them. The only thing I know
again&s;t it, is the mortal di&s;like they have to one
another: and that, my dear brother, is the point
I want to con&s;ult you about; for then we &s;hall be
got off all round: which would be a great thing
off my mind.&endq;</P>
<P>When the happy day arrived for returning to
Cleves, Sir Hugh re-took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his ho&s;pi|table
man&s;ion, amid&s;t the tendere&s;t felicitations of
his fond family, and the almo&s;t clamorous rejoic|ings
of the a&s;&s;embled poor of the neighbourhood:
and the following morning, Mr. Tyrold gave the
hand of Lavinia to Harry We&s;twyn, and Dr.
Marchmont united them; and Edgar, glowing
with happine&s;s, now purified from any alloy, re|ceived
from the &s;ame revered hand, and owed to
the &s;ame honoured voice, the final and la&s;ting
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the tearful, but happy Camilla.</P>

What further remains to fini&s;h this &s;mall &s;ketch
of a Picture of Youth, may be compri&s;ed in a few
pages.</P>
<P>Indiana was more fortunate in her northern ex|pedition,
than experiments of that nature com|monly
prove. Macder&s;ey was a man of honour,
and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed better claims to her than he had either
language or &s;kill to explain: but the good Lord
O'Lerney, who, to benevolence the mo&s;t chearful,
and keenne&s;s the lea&s;t &s;evere, joined judgment and
genero&s;ity, acted as the guardian of his kin&s;man,
and placed the young couple in competence and
comfort.</P>
<P>The profe&s;&s;ion of Macder&s;ey obliging him to
&s;ojourn frequently in country quarters, Indiana,
when the fir&s;t novelty of t&eacute;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;tes was over,
wi&s;hed again for the con&s;tant adulatre&s;s of her
charms and endowments, and, to the inexpre&s;&s;ible
rapture of Sir Hugh, &s;olicited Mi&s;s Margland to
be her companion: and the influence of con&s;tant
flattery was &s;o &s;eductive to her weak mind, that,
though in&s;en&s;ible to the higher motive of cheri&s;h|ing
her in remembrance of her long cares, &s;he was
&s;o &s;poilt by her blandi&s;hments, and &s;o accu&s;tomed
to her management, that &s;he parted from her no
more.</P>
<P>Lavinia, with her de&s;erving partner &s;pent a
month between Cleves and Etherington, and then
accompanied him and his fond father to their
York&s;hire e&s;tate and re&s;idence. Like all characters
of radical worth, &s;he grew daily upon the e&s;teem
and affection of her new family, and found in her
hu&s;band as marked a contra&s;t with Clermont Lyn|mere,
to annul all Hypothe&s;is of Education, as
Lord O'Lerney, cool, rational, and penetrating,
oppo&s;ed to Macder&s;ey, wild, excentric, and vehe|ment,
offered again&s;t all that is National. Brought
up under the &s;ame tutor, the &s;ame ma&s;ters, and at
the &s;ame univer&s;ity, with equal care, equal ex|pence,
equal opportunities of every kind, Clermont
turned out conceited, voluptuous, and &s;hallow;
<PB N="350" REF="177">
Henry mode&s;t, full of feeling, and &s;tored with in|telligence.</P>
<P>Lionel, fir&s;t enraged, but next $amed, by the
di&s;inheritance which he had drawn upon him&s;elf,
had ample &s;ubject in his di&s;appointmen$ to keep
alive his repentance. And though enabled to re|turn
from bani&s;hment, by the ignominious con|demnation,
with another culprit, of the late
partner in his guilt, he felt &s;o lowered from his
fallen pro&s;pects, and &s;o gloomy from his altered
&s;pirits, that when his parents, &s;atisfied with his
puni&s;hment, held out the olive-branch to invite
him home, he came forth again rather as if con|demned,
than forgiven; and, wholly wanting &s;or|titude
either to &s;ee or to avoid his former a&s;&s;ociates,
he procured an appointment that carried him
abroad, where his friends induced him to remain,
till his bad habits, as well as bad connections, were
forgotten, and time aided adver&s;ity in forming
him a new character.</P>
<P>Clermont, for whom his uncle bought a com|mi&s;&s;ion,
fixed him&s;elf in the army; though with
no greater love of his country, than was appendant
to the opportunity it afforded of &s;hewing his fine
per&s;on to regimental advantage.</P>
<P>Mrs. Arlbery was among&s;t the fir&s;t to ha&s;ten
with congratulations to Camilla. With too much
under&s;tanding to betray her pique upon the error
of her judgment, as to the means of attaching
Mandlebert, &s;he had too much goodne&s;s of heart
not to rejoice in the happine&s;s of her young friend.</P>
<P>Mrs. Li&s;&s;in, who accompanied her in the wed|ding
vi&s;it, confe&s;&s;ed her&s;elf the mo&s;t di&s;appointed
and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed of human beings. She had not, &s;he
&s;aid, half &s;o much liberty as when &s;he lived with
her Papa, and heartily repented marrying, and
wi&s;hed &s;he had never thought of it. The &s;ervants
were always teazing her for orders and directions;
every thing that went wrong, it was always &s;he
who was a&s;ked why it was not right; when &s;he
wanted to be driving about all day, the coachman
<PB N="351" REF="178">
always &s;aid it was too much for the hor&s;es; when
&s;he travelled, the maids always a&s;ked her what mu&s;t
be packed up; if &s;he happened to be out at dinner
time, Mr. Li&s;&s;in found fault with every thing's
being cold: if &s;he wanted to do &s;omething &s;he
liked, he &s;aid &s;he had better let it alone; and, in
fine, her violent de&s;ire of this &s;tate of freedom,
ended in conceiving it a &s;tate of bondage; &s;he
found <HI>her own hou&s;e</HI> the hou&s;e of which &s;he mu&s;t
take the charge; being <HI>her own mi&s;tre&s;s,</HI> having the
burthen of &s;uperintending a whole family, and be|ing
<HI>married,</HI> becoming the property of another, to
whom &s;he made over a legal right to treat her ju&s;t
as he plea&s;ed. And as &s;he had cho&s;en neither for
character, nor for di&s;po&s;ition, neither from &s;ym|pathy
nor re&s;pect, &s;he found it hard to &s;ubmit
where &s;he meant to become independent, and dif|ficult
to take the cares where &s;he had made no
provi&s;ion for the &s;olaces of dome&s;tic life.</P>
<P>The notable Mrs. Mittin contrived &s;oon to &s;o
u&s;efully ingratiate her&s;elf in the favour of Mr.
Dennel, that, in the full per&s;$a&s;ion &s;he would &s;ave
him half his annual expences, he married her: but
her friend, Mr. Clykes, was robbed in his jour|ney
home of the ca&s;h which he had &s;o di&s;honour|ably
gained.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t care of Edgar was to clear every debt
in which Camilla had borne any &s;hare, and then
to make over to Lavinia the little portion in|tended
to be parted between the &s;i&s;ters. Henry
would have re&s;i&s;ted; but Mr. Tyrold knew the
fortune of Edgar to be fully adequate to his gene|ro&s;ity,
and &s;u&s;tained the propo&s;ition. Sir Sedley
Clarendel received his two hundred pounds with|out
oppo&s;ition, though with &s;urpri&s;e; and was
dubious whether to rejoice in the &s;hackles he had
e&s;caped, or to lament the charmer he had lo&s;t.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh would &s;uffer no one but him&s;elf to
clear the debts of his two nephews, or re$und
what had been advanced by his excellent old
<PB N="352" REF="179">
friend Mr. We&s;twyn. He called back all his
&s;ervants, liberally recompen&s;ed their marked
attachment, provided particularly for good old
Jacob; and took upon him&s;elf the mo&s;t am|ple
reward for the po&s;tillion who meant to
re&s;cue Eugenia.</P>
<P>The pri&s;oner and his wife, now worthy e&s;tab|li&s;hed
cottagers, were the fir&s;t, at the entrance of
Beech Park, to welcome the bride and bridgroom;
and little Peggy Higden was &s;ent for immediately,
and placed, with extreme&s;t kindne&s;s, where &s;he
might ri&s;e in u&s;e and in profit.</P>
<P>Lord O'Lerney was &s;edulou&s;ly &s;ought by Edgar,
who had the infinite happine&s;s to &s;ee Camilla a
&s;elected friend of Lady I&s;abella Irby, who&s;e bene|volent
care of her in the &s;ea&s;on of her utter di&s;|tre&s;s,
had &s;oftly enchained her tendere&s;t gratitude,
and had excited in him&s;elf an almo&s;t adoring re&s;|pect.</P>
<P>Melmond had received in time the caution of
Camilla, to prevent the meeting to which the
ba&s;ene&s;s of Bellamy was deluding his mi&s;guided
&s;i&s;ter, through her own wild theories. He forbore
to bla&s;t her fame by calling him publicly to ac|count;
and 'ere further arts could be practi&s;ed,
Bellamy was no more.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, in the &s;hock of &s;udden &s;orrow,
&s;hut her&s;elf up from the world. Claims of debts
of honour, which &s;he had no means to an&s;wer,
pur&s;ued her in her retreat; &s;he became at once the
prey of grief, repentance, and &s;hame; and her
mind was yet young enough in wrong, to be pene|trated
by the early cha&s;ti&s;ement of calamity. Re|moved
from the whirl of plea&s;ure, which takes
reflection from action, and feeling from thought,
&s;he reviewed, with poignant contrition, her grace|le&s;s
mi&s;conduct with regard to Eugenia, dete&s;ted
her infatuation, and humbled her&s;elf to implore
forgivene&s;s. Her aunt &s;eized the agitating mo|ment
of &s;elf-upbraiding and worldly di&s;gu&s;t, to
<PB N="353" REF="180">
impre&s;s upon her fears the le&s;&s;ons of her opening
life: and thus, repul&s;ed from pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;ickened
of di&s;&s;ipation, though too illiberally in&s;tructed for
chearful and rational piety, &s;he was happily
&s;natched from utter ruin by protecting, though
excentric enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Eugenia, for &s;ome time, continued in voluntary
&s;eclu&s;ion, happily reaping from the fruits of her
education and her virtues, re&s;ources and reflexions
for retirement, that robbed it of wearine&s;s. The
name, the recollection of Bellamy, always made her
&s;hudder, but the peace of perfect innocence was &s;oon
re&s;tored to her mind. The &s;ufferings of. Mrs. Berlin|ton
from &s;elf-reproach, taught her yet more fully
to value the felicity of blamele&s;&s;ne&s;s; and the gene|rous
liberality of her character, made the fir&s;t in|ducement
&s;he felt for exertion, the benevolence of
giving &s;olace to a penitent who had injured her.</P>
<P>Melmond, long con&s;cious of her worth, and
di&s;gu&s;ted with all that had rivalled it in his mind,
with the fervour of &s;incerity, yet diffidence of
&s;hame and regret, now fearfully &s;ought the favour
he before had reluctantly received. But Eugenia
retreated. She had no courage for a new engage|ment,
no faith for new vows, no hope for new
happine&s;s: till his really exemplary character, with
the &s;ympathy of his feelings, and the &s;imilarity of
his ta&s;te and turn of mind with her own, made
the Tyrolds, when they perceived his a&s;cendance,
&s;econd his wi&s;hes. Approbation &s;o &s;acred, joined
to a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion &s;o tender, &s;oon conquered every
timid difficulty in the ingenuous Eugenia; who in
his well-earnt e&s;teem, and grateful affection, re|ceived,
at length, the recompence of every exerted
virtue, and the &s;olace of every pa&s;t &s;uffering.
Melmond, in a companion delighting in all his
favourite pur&s;uits, and capable of joining even in
his &s;everer &s;tudies, &s;ound a charm to beguile from
him all former regret, while rea&s;on and experi|ence
endeared his ultimate choice. Eugenia once
<PB N="354" REF="181">
loved, was loved for ever. Where her counte|nance
was looked at, her complexion was forgo|ten;
while her voice was heard, her figure was
unob&s;erved; where her virtues were known,
they &s;eemed but to be enhanced by her per&s;onal
misfortunes.</P>
<P>The Baronet was enchanted to &s;ee her thus un|expectedly
happy, and &s;oon transferred to Mel|mond
the cla&s;&s;ical re&s;pe$$ which Clermont had for|feited,
when he concurred with Eugenia in a peti|tion,
that Dr. Orkborne, without further delay,
might be enabled to retire to his own plans and
pur&s;uits, with &s;uch ju&s;t and honourable con&s;idera|tion
for labours he well knew how to appreciate,
as his friend Mr. Tyrold &s;hould judge to be worthy
of his acceptance.</P>
<P>With joy expanding to that thankfulne&s;s which
may be called the <HI>beauty of piety,</HI> the virtuous
Tyrolds, as their fir&s;t ble&s;&s;ings, received the&s;e
ble&s;&s;ings of their children: and the bene&s;icent Sir
Hugh felt every wi&s;h &s;o &s;atisfied, he could &s;$ar$ely
occupy him&s;elf again with a project&mdash;&s;ave a
maxim of prudence drawn from his own experi|ence,
which he daily planned teaching to the little
generation ri&s;ing around him; To avoid, from
the di&s;a&s;ters of their Uncle, the Dangers and
Temptations, to their De&s;cendants, of Un&s;ettled
Collateral Expectations.</P>
<P>Thus ended the long conflicts, doubts, &s;u&s;penc|es,
and &s;ufferings of Edgar and Camilla; who,
without one inevitable calamity, one unavaidable

heedle&s;&s;ne&s;s of youth unguided, or to the
acquired di&s;tru&s;t of experience that had been

the repo&s;itory of her every thought; and her
friends read her exqui&s;ite lot in a gaiety no longer
to be feared: while, faithful to his word, making
Etherington, Cleves, and Beech Park, his al$ernate

dwellings, he rarely parted her from her fond
Parents, and enraptured Uncle. And Dr. March|mont,
as he &s;aw the pure innocence, open frank|ne&s;s,
and &s;potle&s;s honour of her heart, found her
virtues, her errors, her facility, or her de&s;peration,
but A PICTURE OF YOUTH; and regretting
the fal&s;e light given by the &s;pirit of compari&s;on,
in the hypothe&s;is which he had formed from in|dividual
experience, acknowlekged its inju&s;tice,
its narrowne&s;s and its arrogance. What, at la&s;t,
&s;o diver&s;ified as man? what &s;o little to be judged
by his fellow?</P>
