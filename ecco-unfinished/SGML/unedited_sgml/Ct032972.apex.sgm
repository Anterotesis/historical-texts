<HEAD>THE SHORTEST WAY To Peace and Union, &amp;c. INTRODUCTION.</HEAD>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;IT was always my Opinion, that whoever &s;hould go about to widen the Difference, or encrea&s;e the Mi&s;under&s;tandings between the Church of <HI>England</HI> and the Di&s;&s;enters,</Q> were the real Enemies of both.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;&punc;Tis an Unhappine&s;s that the &s;ober, thinking Men on both &s;ides are &s;en|&s;ible of, that there &s;hould be any Difference at all; and I am of the Opi|nion that would either &s;ide incline a little, the Breach might be ea&s;ily le&s;&s;|en'd,</Q> tho' perhaps not quite clos'd.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;And if ever a temper of Charity and Love &s;hould chance to prevail in this contentious unhappy Nation, I am fully per&s;waded, even a Capacity as weak as mine, might be able to propo&s;e Methods which might bring the Two Parties much nearer together.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;But while there is a breach of Charity, there can never be a union of Principles; and till the railing Spirit on either &s;ide is &s;uppre&s;s'd, the breach widens rather than heals, and all tends to the confu&s;ion of the General Pro|te&s;tant Intere&s;t both at Home and Abroad.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;That there are Per&s;ons on both &s;ides, who either from Pa&s;&s;ion or Preju|dice, Intere&s;t, or other wor&s;e Rea&s;ons, continue to encrea&s;e the unhappy &s;trife, by rendring both &s;ides &s;u&s;pected, and odious to one another, is a Truth too plain to be que&s;tion'd, and 'twould be an Impertinence I can|not di&s;pence with,</Q> to &s;pend time in the proof of it.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Nor is it &s;o much my de&s;ign to examine who they are, which in my opinion would be marking Men out for the General hatred, and expo&s;ing them to be &s;ton'd in the Streets. If I could prevail with both &s;ides to cea&s;e and di&s;courage the practice, the Per&s;ons would &s;ee their Errors, and might be forgiven by God and the Nation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;You are very much in the right of it, &s;ays a Gentleman, that in defence of &s;ome angry People, re&s;ents a late unhappy Book of mine, call'd, <HI>The Shorte&s;t Way, You are in the right of it to conceal Names, le&s;t your own &s;hould &s;tand fir&s;t in the Catalogue.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Truly I cannot deny but I am very &s;orry I publi&s;h'd that Book, becau&s;e the ill Management of it, has prevented my further Explaining of it; and now, becau&s;e I unwarily let &s;ome things &s;lip, at which the Government have too much cau&s;e to be Offended; and tho' to them who judge by out|&s;ides, my De&s;ign is Condemn'd, yet I cannot but prote&s;t to the World, that neither in that Book, nor in any thing I ever wrote, did I ever de|&s;ign
<PB N="4" REF="4">
to rai&s;e a F$ud between the Di&s;&s;enters and the Church of <HI>England;</HI> I never &s;aid, or believ d, the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as a Body, de&s;ign'd to ruine and de&s;tory the Di&s;&s;enters: But that there are &s;ome Men in the Church, who, indeed, are not of her, and who have by their Writings and Preach|ings te&s;tified the rancor of their Spirits, and the earne&s;t de&s;ires of their Souls to have the Di&s;&s;enters ruin d, is mo&s;t true, and at tho&s;e I levell'd; however, an ill Marks-man I have been thought, to aim at one thing and &s;hoot another.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Nor am I making an Appology here to move the Mercy of the Govern|ment, I have already re&s;olv'd in that Ca&s;e, that as a good Subject does not willingly offend, &s;o having by Inadvertancy fallen into the publick Di&s;plea|&s;ure, I &s;ubmit to the Clemency of my Superior, with this Re&s;olution, <HI>It is the Queen,</HI></Q> <HI>let Her Maje&s;ty do with me what &s;eems good in her Eyes.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;Nor &s;hall the Apprehen&s;ion of the Severity of Her Maje&s;ties Re&s;ent|ment, cau&s;e me to cea&s;e the endeavour, of bringing, as far as writing can do it, a fair Reconciliation of Parties in View: When a Fray is begun, the Standers by may part them, and bring them together; but if they will not &s;hake Hands,</Q> 'tis their own Fault.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;And that I may inform the World, that as far as I have been able, this has always been both my principle and practice; I Challenge the wor&s;t Enemies I have to find out, among any thing ever publi&s;h'd by me, the lea&s;t Shadow of a Temper di$fering from this healing principle.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;To this end, the following Sheets have been compos'd &s;ome Years ago, and have now very &s;mall Additions, as to Circum&s;tances, and were de&s;ign'd as an Introduction to a healing Conjunction of parties, which I had form'd in my Thoughts; for I doubt not, but I could ea&s;ily lay down &s;uch a Scheme of a General Union of Prote&s;tants in this Nation, as to politick Intere&s;t, as well as Religion, as no man on either &s;ide could oppo&s;e, with|out being a manife&s;t Incendiary, a Di&s;turber of the Publick Peace, and an Enemy to its e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government: But while I am in the Hands of the Law, I think 'tis time to have done writing; and if the Spirit of Peace would but po&s;&s;e&s;s the Minds of Men, there are better Pens and better Heads than mine to make the propo&s;al.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;It is not for me to tell our Governours they take wrong Mea&s;ures with the Di&s;&s;enters; and the Di&s;&s;enters would be angry if I &s;hould tell them there is Ill Blood among them; and &s;ome Church Men would think them|&s;elves injur'd, if I &s;hould &s;ay they imprudently encrea&s;e it: But I heartily wi&s;h I could &s;ay, all the&s;e three things were fal&s;e and Idle Chimera's of my own.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;And yet I would be content to be condemn'd to <HI>Newgate</HI> all the Days of my Life, if I did not lay down &s;uch undentable Te&s;timonies of the Truth of tho&s;e Heads as &s;hould convince all the unbva&s;s'd Judgments in the Na|tion and after that, &s;ub$oin &s;uch a Method of peace, Union, Love and Cha|rity among all the prote&s;tants of this Nation, as no Man but he who&s;e Rea|&s;on was a Slave to Intere&s;t, pa&s;&s;ion, or &s;ome ill De&s;ign, could find in his Heart to di&s;like.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;I do not &s;ay but any Man of either &s;ide, who&s;e Heart was touch'd from on high, with a Zeal for the good of <HI>England,</HI> for the pro&s;perity of the Prote|&s;tant Intere&s;t, and for the Glory of the pre&s;ent Government, might add to, amend, and I hope at la&s;t fini&s;h &s;o de&s;irable a Work; but I am fully per|&s;waded, I could State preliminaries of &s;uch a League of Amity, &s;uch a Uni|on of Affection, as &s;hould make us One people, with One Heart, and On$
<PB N="5" REF="5">
Intere&s;t, equally Zealous, Loyal, and Affectionate to the per&s;on of the Queen and the E&s;tabli&s;hment of the Government; and that Government remain ju&s;t the &s;ame,</Q> untouch d, unalter'd Con&s;titution that it is now.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq;But as I am not worthy to be the Author of &s;o great a Work, &s;o neither &s;hall I venture the farther Oppre&s;&s;ion of my private Circum&s;tances, by endeavouring to reconcile parties that re&s;olve not to be reconcil'd, unle&s;s I can receive the protection Due to a Me&s;&s;enger of peace.</Q></P>
<P>IT has often been objected to the Di&s;&s;enters, by tho&s;e who, with intent to widen our Breaches, are fond of blackening them as a party, That they are Enemies of Government; That their principles are incompatible with Monarchy; and that they are therefore dangerous both to the Church and State, that they mu&s;t be continually plotting again&s;t, becau&s;e naturally di&s;contented with the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment; That they hate the Queen be|cau&s;e &s;he loves the Church, and the like.</P>
<P>From hence the furious Authors have drawn &s;uch Con&s;equences, as were the Affertions true, would be natural enough, That the Church ought to provide again&s;t them as a dangerous Brood hatch'd under her Wing, that will lo&s;e no Opportunity to de&s;troy her; That they ought to be &s;o far from being admitted into the Admini&s;tration, that they ought not to be tru&s;ted with the priviledge of Freeholders, or to Vote for tho&s;e that are, and the like. <HI>New A&s;&s;ociation, Page</HI> 1.</P>
<P>But if after all that can be &s;aid on this Subject, it will appear that the true Intere&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters, is bound up in the pro&s;perity of the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment; that their Safety depends upon the protection of the Govern|ment; and that they cannot be guilty of endeavouring the Subver&s;ion of Monarchy, without &s;triking at the Door of their own pro&s;perity, and bring|ing them&s;elves into al$ the Confu&s;ions and Di&s;tre&s;&s;es they can wi&s;h to be delivered from; then the Arguments mu&s;t cea&s;e of Cour&s;e, the Con&s;equences mu&s;t be ab&s;ur'd, becau&s;e the Cau&s;es are Untrue; the Di&s;&s;enters mu&s;t fir&s;t be arraign'd for Fools, before they can be indicted for Rebels; and ought to be &s;ent to <HI>Bedlam</HI> and not to <HI>Newgate.</HI></P>
<P>Mankind at lea&s;t, &s;uch as are in their Wits, are properly &s;aid not to be capable of doing what they cannot do rationally; what they cannot do without prejudices to their own Intere&s;t they cannot do; that is, they can|not do it without being for&s;aken of their Sen&s;es, their common Under&s;tand|ing and their Hone&s;ty.</P>
<P>In order to come to a State of my propo&s;ition, I mu&s;t premi&s;e, that when I &s;peak of the Di&s;&s;enters, I mean the General Body of all Sorts of prote|&s;tants, who &s;eparate in Wor&s;hip from the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Church; and when I &s;peak of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> I mean the General Body of Orthodox Conformi&s;ts; and I take no Notice of the private De&s;igns or private Tem|pers of Men, who may broach their own Opinions, or declare Sentiments quite Differing from the Body of their own party.</P>
<P>Thus, when &s;ome hot violent Men have broke the Rules of all Mode&s;ty in their Anathema's on the Di&s;&s;enters, and have doom'd them to a wor&s;e Fate than the <HI>French</HI> Hugonots, it cannot be agreeable to the Ju&s;tice of Argument, to brand the Church of <HI>England,</HI> with any part of their principles, unle&s;s they had approv d them by &s;ome publick Act of the Church, or merited a Claim to the Charge by a General practice.</P>
<P>And thus, tho there may be &s;ome people among the many &s;everal Sects of Di&s;&s;enters, who may po&s;&s;e&s;s &s;omething of Antimonarchical principles, and
<PB N="6" REF="6">
may retain the Spirit of Rebellion, the General Body of the Di&s;&s;enters ought not to be branded with the black Mark of Rebels, Enemies to the Govern|ment, and dangerous to the Nation, unle&s;s they had committed &s;ome Crime as a Body which &s;hould merit &s;uch a Character.</P>
<P>And as on the one Hand, I am fully per&s;waded, that the Di&s;&s;enters of this Nation, taking them in general, except as before excepted, are not de&s;irous of any Change of Government; &s;o I think 'tis ea&s;ie to make it out, that while they are Ma&s;ters of their Wits, and have their Eyes open to their True Intere&s;t, they can never de&s;ire to have any part of the Government alter'd chang'd, or otherwi&s;e &s;ettled than it is.</P>
<P>If any Di&s;&s;enter be of another Mind, or if any Man, to fully their Cha|racter, will &s;uppo&s;e it of them, I would be glad to &s;ee it made out what &s;ort of Settlement, &s;uppo&s;e it were in their power, could they make which would be more to their Advantage.</P>
<P>To come to make the paralel, 'tis nece&s;&s;ary to ob&s;erve a State of the Di&s;&s;|enters Circum&s;tances under the pre&s;ent Government.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, They enjoy all their Civil Rights, their Liberty and property &s;tands upon the &s;ame Foot with their Church of <HI>England</HI> Conforming Neighbours; in Matters of Right or Wrong, 'tis not examin'd whether they are Di&s;&s;en|ters or no, but i$ they are <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men; 'tis not requir'd of them to concern their Spiritual Cipa&s;ities, which their Temporal; their E&s;tates are their own, and their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them &s;ecur'd by the &s;ame Laws, their Inheri|tances de&s;cend by uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion to their po&s;terity.</P>
<P>Secondly, Their Religious Liberty is tolerated by a Law, and no Con|formity is exacted of them, they are invited to Church, but not driven, Ex|communications, Confi&s;cations, &amp;c. for not coming to Church, are al tak|en off, the Talons of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Harpyes, at <HI>Doctors Commons</HI> are Cut, and tho&s;e Birds of prey have their Wings pinion'd by the Law.</P>
<P>Thirdly, This Liberty is Univer&s;al to all Sorts, Kinds, and &s;eperate So|cieties of Di&s;&s;enters, from the Quaker to the Jacobite Conformi&s;t; the Spi|ri of Per&s;ecution is laid, and has left off haunting us in this Nation, every Man &s;erves GOD his own way, and there is no Re&s;traint in Matters of Religion or Policy, only that in the latter, to pre&s;erve the Government in the Hands of the Churches Friends; all Per&s;ons who have any Share in the Admini&s;tration are oblig'd to conform; and this is by Act of Parliament, that is, to &s;ay, it is an Act of all the People con&s;ented to by them all, in their Repre&s;entatives, and therefore is what we ought to &s;ubmit to with Chear|f$lne&s;s.</P>
<P>I know &s;ome object the Rea&s;onablene&s;s of &s;uch a Law as makes Religious Ordinances the Te&s;t of Capacity for Civil Employments, and much has been &s;aid on that Point, that the Law was made to plea&s;e one Party, and on Pur|po&s;e to oppre&s;s another Party, and the like.</P>
<P>If the Di&s;pute were between <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Pagans,</HI> or <HI>Chri&s;tians</HI> and <HI>Jews,</HI> it might have &s;ome Rea&s;on in it, and none would be fit to be tru&s;ted with a Branch of the Government, who were in principle, mortal profe&s;s'd Enemies to it, on Account of Religion, and in &s;uch Ca&s;e a Religious Conformity would be a proper Te&s;t of the Party.</P>
<P>But waving the&s;e Arguments, we are not to con&s;ider what, in right Rea|&s;oning, we think ought to be a Law; but what actually is a Law enacted by the Legi&s;lator of the Nation, and to which, as Freeholders, we have given a tacit Con&s;ent, and therefore bound our &s;elves either to that Ob&s;ervation or the Penalty.</P>
<P><PB N="7" REF="7">
Be&s;ides, What is the publick po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of places, or Offices of Tru&s;t, in a Government, to the Ca&s;e of Religion? they who &s;eperate from the Com|munion of a Church, cannot in Rea&s;on, expect to be entertain'd in the Ser|vice of that very Church; and they that &s;eperate from the Church, ought to con&s;ider Places and Offices beforehand, and to examine, whether they can forego them for their Con&s;ciences or not; and if they did &s;o, they would not be &s;o frequently foregoing their Con&s;ciences to po&s;&s;e&s;s them again.</P>
<P>And I cannot but wonder at, and condemn the Inju&s;tice of &s;uch Di&s;&s;enters who would have tho&s;e People, to who&s;e Communion they cannot, or will not joyn, receive them into equal Advantages of Honour and of Profit, of Tru&s;t and Management, in the Politick Concern.</P>
<P>I cannot approve the Equity of it, nor I wou'd not have the Di&s;&s;enters cover it, nor had they the Government in their Hands would they admit, it them&s;elves.</P>
<P>This Coveting Offices of Tru&s;t, Honour and Profit in the Government has been the Cau&s;e of that Occa&s;ional Compliance, which to the Di&s;honour and Shame of the Di&s;&s;enters, has branded them with too much Levity and Religion.</P>
<P>But in all Profe&s;&s;ions, and in all Ages, from the Young Man in the Go&s;|pel, who&s;e Temptation was, that he had great Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, Covetou&s;ne&s;s and Ambition have been Snares to Religion; but neither does this Loo&s;ne&s;s of Principle lie as a Ju&s;t Charge upon the whole Body of the Di&s;&s;enters; nor &s;hou'd they bear the Error as a Brand upon the General Character, any more than the Church of <HI>England</HI> ought to be branded, with that General Odium of Cruelty, and barbarous de&s;tructive principles again&s;t their Di&s;&s;enting Neighbours, becau&s;e &s;ome of their Mini&s;ters from the Pulpit, have thundred out this Fiery Doctrine to their Hearers.</P>
<P>And therefore, in equal Ju&s;tice to both Sides, I think 'tis Ju&s;t to agree, that neither party ought to be denominated from the Hot de&s;tructive Lati|tude of a Few, but from the general Practice, and known Principle of the Body, and Generality on both Sides.</P>
<P>That the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as a Church guided by their Genuine Tem|per, as Chri&s;tians and <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, and govern'd by their known Principles, and the Canon of their Con&s;titution have nothing &s;o Antichri&s;tian among them, as can leave room to &s;ugge&s;t, they would be the De&s;troyers of their Brethren, and &s;et up Fire and Faggot among us, is plain from various Cir|cum&s;tances of Time and Action. The Revolution, the Act of Toleration, and their pre&s;ent Re&s;entment of this Temper lately pre&s;ented to them, Un|ma&s;q'd, are Modern Te&s;timonies of it.</P>
<P>That the Di&s;&s;enters, in general, are fully &s;atisfy'd with the Circum&s;tances of their pre&s;ent Settlement, and the Toleration they enjoy, and no other|wi&s;e unea&s;ie, than as they have indu&s;triou&s;ly been made to apprehend the Privileges and Toleration they enjoy are aim'd at, and endeavour'd to be le&s;&s;en'd or overthrown, is manife&s;t.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t. Becau&s;e all the late Reign, while their Toleration and Privileges were &s;ecure, they were entirely Ea&s;ie, fully pleas'd, and had nothing to wi&s;h, more than they enjoy'd: And Secondly, That under all the Unea&s;ine&s;s they have in this Reign expre&s;s'd, the renew'd&punc; A&s;&s;urances of the Continuance of their Toleration from the Royal Promi&s;es of the Queen, have been as Life to them from the Dead, and at all times revives their Satisfaction after it has receiv'd any Shock from the Violence and Threatnings of a party.</P>
<P>What, tho' among the Church of <HI>England,</HI> or among the Di&s;&s;enters, there
<PB N="8" REF="8">
are Incendiaries, &s;ome on one &s;ide, who till they knew it was wrote by a Di&s;&s;enter, hugg'd the Book, call'd, <HI>The &s;horte&s;t Way&punc;</HI> like an Oracle, and a new Invention that de&s;erv'd a Patent for the Practice; &s;o$e that have preach d the &s;ame Thing, Printed the &s;ame Thing, and declar d it to be the beit and propere&s;t way in the World, to &s;ettle the p$ace of the Nation, as well as the Peace of the Church; &s;ome on the one &s;ide, who are angry at being di&s;|po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of their Hopes of good places, and can di&s;pence with Sacraments, &amp;c. on Occa&s;ion, to enrich them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Both Sides, i$ they would &s;tudy the Nations peace, the Queens Honour, and the pro&s;perity of our Commerce would indu&s;triou&s;ly cru&s;h and di&s;cou|rage the Extreams on either Side, and in the Middle might be found, that ble&s;&s;ed path of peace and Union, which would lead the whole Body of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, to the full Enjoyment of that univer&s;al Charity and Love that every hone&s;t Man wi&s;hes for.</P>
<P>Here would be no Encroaching on one another, no Jealou&s;ie of parties; the Di&s;&s;enters would have no Rea&s;on to &s;eek places, to keep &s;uch out as would endeavour to Ruine them; nor they could no more Grudge the pro|fits and Advancements of Secular Tru&s;t to the Members of the Church, be|cau&s;e they would be &s;atisfy'd; they wou'd not mi&s;&s;apply their power to the Injury of their Di&s;&s;enting Brethren; and the Church Men, when they &s;aw the Di&s;&s;enters cea&s;e to Encroach upon them, would have no room for any uncharitable Sugge&s;tions, nor any Ground to Charge them with &s;editi|ous practices or De&s;igns to overwhelm the Government, &s;ubdue Monarchy, or erect Confu&s;ion and intolerable Anarchy.</P>
<P>In order to this happy Regularity, I proceed to &s;tate my propo&s;ition, that 'tis the True Intere&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England,</HI> to be govern'd by a Church of <HI>England</HI> Magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>And as I pretend, in what I write, to as much Impartiality as I can, &s;o I am not at all careful of di&s;plea&s;ing parties, if I do it in a direct pur&s;uit of Truth.</P>
<P>And therefore while I fir&s;t turn upon my Friends the Di&s;&s;enters, tho' they may be angry with me, I cannot help laying down this as the fir&s;t Rea&s;on of my Propo&s;ition: <HI>viz.</HI> That they are not qualified to be tru&s;ted with the Government of them&s;elves.</P>
<P>Nor do I go back to the years of Forty one, about which &s;uch a <HI>Pother</HI> has been made, as if all the pre&s;ent Di&s;&s;enters had been in Arms again&s;t their King, tho' not one in Five hundred of them was then Born; or as if they had all a hand in the death of King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t; or at lea&s;t, with St. <HI>Paul,</HI> in the Ca&s;e of St. <HI>Stephen,</HI> had been con&s;enting to his Death: But as a quarrel, which was ended before I was born, I have nothing to do with it; Let tho&s;e people accu&s;e the Di&s;&s;enters of that, who have undertaken to ju&s;tify the Church of <HI>England</HI> in a Ca&s;e &s;omething like it, as the late Revo|lution.</P>
<P>I think the Fable of the Country men, who made their addre&s;s to <HI>Jupiter</HI> for good Weather for their Harve&s;t, is &s;omething at Emblem of what I mean; they who dwelt in the Plains and moi&s;t Ground de&s;ir'd fair Wea|ther, and they who dwelt on the Hills de&s;ir'd Rain, upon which the Deity order'd them to go together and con&s;ult of it, and when they could agree what Weather to ask for that would plea&s;e them all, they &s;hould come again.</P>
<P>Now, if on the late, or any Revolution, it had been propo&s;ed to the Di&s;&s;|enters to have the Government of this Nation, I mean the Civil as well as Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Authority &s;ettled in their Hands, and in order to &s;uch a Settle|ment
<PB N="9" REF="9">
they were all met together to con&s;ider of it, I would be glad to be inform'd in what manner they could po&s;&s;ibly have agreed about it: 'Tis not my pre&s;ent Enquiry what manner of Government they would have agreed upon, I have el&s;ewhere &s;ufficiently prov'd, that the Con&s;titution, Intere&s;t, and Genius of the whole Nation would lead them to a Monarchy,, and to the &s;ame individual Monarchy now &s;ettled; but my Que&s;tion is, in what manner they would agree in the &s;ettling this very Monarchy?</P>
<P>The General body of the Di&s;&s;enters are compos'd of Four &s;orts, and tho&s;e Four &s;o oppo&s;ite in their Temper, Cu&s;toms, Doctrine and Di&s;cipline, that I am of opinion tis as probable all Four &s;hould Conform to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as to one another.</P>
<P>There is the <HI>Presbyterian, Independant, Anabapti&s;t</HI> and <HI>Quaker;</HI> now, if the&s;e Four were met like a <HI>Poli&s;h</HI> Diet on Hor&s;eback to choo&s;e a King, he mu&s;t be a great deal wi&s;er than I that can but gue&s;s out of which Party all the other Three could con&s;ent to Name a King; or by which party all the other Three could con&s;ent to be Govern d; for that would be the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> of it.</P>
<P>The <HI>Independant</HI> could never bear <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Government, that has been tryed already; for they once pull d it down by the Ears as intolerable.</P>
<P>The <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> in general, declare the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> would &s;etup Per&s;ecution from the old Principle. That <HI>Presbyteries</HI> are <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> and therefore to them, a <HI>Presbyterian</HI> Government would be all one with <HI>Popery.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Presbyterian</HI> would never brook an <HI>Independant</HI> or <HI>Anabapti&s;t</HI> Govern|ment, becau&s;e they count the one Sectary, and hardly admit the other to be Orthodox Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>None of the Three would bear the thought of a <HI>Quaker</HI> King, the Novelty would make Mankind Laugh at the Propo&s;al, the Splendor and Magnificence of a Court, and the nece&s;&s;ary Defence and Offence which the Confederacies and Intere&s;ts of Nations require, are things &s;o incon&s;i&s;tent with this plain dealing Profe&s;&s;or, that he mu&s;t cea&s;e to be a Quaker when he began to be a King; and they would then be much in doubt what Religion, and con&s;e|quently what Party he would choo&s;e; and therefore none of the Parties would agree to him.</P>
<P>So that the whole Body might, like the Country men, go home and con|&s;ider of it, and come to the A&s;&s;embly again when they were agreed upon the Point.</P>
<P>And if the Crown of this Kingdom does but remain in a Succe&s;&s;ion of Church of <HI>England</HI> Monarchs, till the&s;e Four can agree which of them &s;hall Reign, the Benediction of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Par&s;on to King <HI>James</HI> the Fir&s;t may be fulfill'd, That they &s;hall Reign as long as the Sun and Moon endure.</P>
<P>In the next place were the Government fix'd in any one of the&s;e Parties, without the Concurrence of the re&s;t, it does not appear to me that any Single Party would be &s;trong enough to maintain them&s;elves; for tho&s;e who did not freely con&s;ent to, would not willingly a&s;&s;i&s;t the Government; and every little di&s;&s;atisfaction of Parties would &s;hock the Con&s;titution. Revo|lutions would be as frequent as In&s;urrections; and Mobbing our Gover|nors, be as familiar as a Street Riot; con&s;equently property would be ne|ver &s;ecur'd, nor Families pre&s;erv'd; for 'tis very rarely &s;een in Governments that Crowns &s;hift Sides, but the Patrons of the la&s;t Government Sink un|der the Oppre&s;&s;ions of the pre&s;ent; The Favourities of one &s;ide, ri&s;e upon the ruins of the la&s;t; and the next turn wheels them under the Stage, and &s;ets up others? and &s;o on to the General Revolution of all things.</P>
<P>'Tis true, there is a thing call'd the People, the Multitude, the Rabble, or in a more Modern Term, the Mob: the&s;e like a great Raft of Timber in
<PB N="10" REF="10">
a River which receives the Tides from the Sea, are ever a Float, and drive this way or that, as they are hurried on by the General Current: 'tis true al&s;o that their Force is irre&s;i&s;tibly Violent, and nothing can with&s;tand them: but &s;till like the Raft of Timber, when the force of the Tide is &s;pent, and the Stream turns, they are as certain to Drive back again with the &s;ame Vio|lence of Motion as ever they were to move at all: &s;o that there is no more advantage from this Crowd to one party than there is to another. The &s;ame Mob will Huzza a King to his Throne, and Halloo him out of the Nation.</P>
<P>The &s;trength therefore of any party in this Nation con&s;i&s;ts in the power of its real Intere&s;t: for let the be&s;t King that ever Reign'd in <HI>England,</HI> be invaded by the wor&s;t, if he beat him in the Field but one Battail, he is gone, the Nation is all his own.</P>
<P>This is too plain from Hi&s;tory: <HI>William the Conqu ror</HI> fought but one Bat|tail for the whole Nation; and I know not one In&s;tance in all our Hi&s;tory, of any Prince that fought two, except King <HI>Jo4n. Maud</HI> the Empre&s;s Invad|ed King <HI>Stephen,</HI> and in one Battail the whole Quarrel run over to her. In the Ca&s;e of <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, and <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth, one &s;ingle Battail, at a time, &s;hifted the Crown of <HI>England</HI> Five or Six times; the like in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Henry</HI> the Seventh. In the Duke of <HI>Monmouth's</HI> Ca&s;e one Fight ended the Di&s;pute: And in our late Revolution, no Fight at all, but the appearance of an Army, gain'd the General Concurrence of the people.</P>
<P>In Ca&s;e therefore of the Government being to be tendred to the Di&s;&s;en|ters, they would never agree among them&s;elves who &s;hould have it; and if any one party obtain'd it without the con&s;ent of the other, he would never be able to hold it: and the Nation would be expos'd to inevitable Confu|&s;ions and Di&s;tractions.</P>
<P>Po&s;&s;ibly the Di&s;&s;enters may take it ill, if I &s;hould &s;ay they are not quali|fied with a Governing Temper: and &s;ince they are not like to be tryed, 'tis needle&s;s to enquire whether they are or no: but I am apt to think the mo&s;t &s;en&s;ible Men among them will acknowledge it, <HI>the&s;e Brethren would fall out by the way:</HI> they want &s;ome qualifications which are very nece&s;&s;ary to Go|vernment, as Charity, Patience, but particularly penetration and Genero&s;ity.</P>
<P>I allow this may be from the Accidents of their Circum&s;tances, and the paucity of their Numbers: the Men of Con&s;cience being, by the Scripture, Direction, not to be look'd for among the Wi&s;e or Noble, that is, not among the politicians nor the Gentry.</P>
<P>But God Almighty can qualifie, <HI>&s;ays a Di&s;&s;enter now,</HI> and give a Spirit of Government where he plea&s;es to give a Call to Governing.</P>
<P>I confe&s;s that freely, and therefore it &s;eems to me very plain, that where he has not be&s;tow'd the Spirit of Government, he has not de&s;ign'd to entru&s;t the power of it: and therefore I would advi&s;e the Di&s;&s;enters in <HI>England</HI> not to concern them&s;elves about it, at lea&s;t while they are not ill Treated, Op|pre&s;s'd or per&s;ecuted by tho&s;e who have the power of Governing.</P>
<P>Upon the&s;e Con&s;iderations, and more I could name, if I thought the&s;e were not &s;ufficient, I verily believe, that were the Four &s;orts of people which I have nam'd as con&s;tituting the Body of the Di&s;&s;enters, enquir'd of &s;eparate|ly, they would all Vote the Government into the hands of the Church of <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>What would the <HI>Anabapti&s;t</HI> &s;ay, if 'twere enquir'd of them by them&s;elves, <HI>Who will you have to be your King, a Presbyterian or a Church of</HI> England <HI>Man?</HI> They would mo&s;t certainly an&s;wer, if their General An&s;wers in like Ca&s;es may be regarded, the Church of <HI>England:</HI> For under them we &s;hall have a
<PB N="11" REF="11">
Toleration; but th&punc; other will per&s;ecute us in particular from all the re&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters, and from the old principle of <HI>Jure Divine,</HI> will &s;ay of all that are not of their own Opinion, <HI>Compell them to come in.</HI></P>
<P>What will the <HI>Presbyterian</HI> &s;ay, if the Church or <HI>Independant</HI> were propo&s;ed? They'd all cry out the Church of <HI>England:</HI> for the&s;e <HI>Independants</HI> will be for Levelling us all to their own narrow principles, till we &s;hall have no Go|vernment left at all, and at la&s;t no poverty, but run all into Fifth Monarchy Men, and make us &s;ell our E&s;tates for the u&s;e of the Saints.</P>
<P>If the <HI>Anabapti&s;ts</HI> and the Church were in Competition, they'd Cry out again, give us the Church of <HI>England</HI> Government, for the&s;e have no Go|vernment at all: we know not what to &s;ay of them, and hardly know whether &s;ome of them are Chri&s;tians or no.</P>
<P>As to the <HI>Qu$$ers:</HI> neither would they brook any of the Three, nor any of the Three them: &s;o that natural Con&s;equences, the Rea&s;on of the Thing, the Temper of the &s;eparate parties, and in general, the Intere&s;t of the whole, would make all the Di&s;&s;enters Unanimous, in de&s;iring to be govern'd by the Church of <HI>England</HI> Magi&s;tracy.</P>
<P>I can yet &s;ee no Tolerable Objection again&s;t this Doctrine: and I do not think it betters an Argument at all, to form trifling Objections, on purpo&s;e to an&s;wer them.</P>
<P>But if this Doctrine be true, then &s;ome Con&s;equences are to be drawn from it, which would, if well improv'd, lay the Foundation of an intire peace, a firm Union and Confidence between the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite parties in this Nation: &s;o that &s;peaking of publick Intere&s;t, there &s;hould never be any Contention, any Strife, Jealou&s;ies, or Animo&s;ities more: the Government &s;hould for ever e&s;teem the Di&s;&s;enter, tho' differing in Opinion, yet as Loyal and Affectionate to their Intere&s;t as any of the re&s;t of its Subjects, &s;ince ha|ving devolv'd all their Thoughts into this one Re&s;olution, That 'tis be&s;t for the Nation, and be&s;t for their Intere&s;t, that the Church of <HI>England</HI> party &s;hould be the governing, ruling party, and be intru&s;ted with the Civil pow|er: they could not imagine any Danger from them, becau&s;e no people ever willingly Act again&s;t their own Intere&s;t as &s;uch: and the Di&s;&s;enters not know|ing where better to fix the Government, than where it is, could never be &s;o bewitch'd, or for&s;aken of their Rea&s;on, to endeavour to alter it.</P>
<P>On the other Hand, the Di&s;&s;enters having no De&s;ire to alter, could have no Advantage to di&s;turb the Government, and con&s;equently could have no Rea|&s;on to &s;truggle to wind them&s;elves into any part of the Magi&s;tracy, e&s;pecially being fully &s;atisfy'd, that it was already in the be&s;t Hands it could be for the Benefit of the Whole.</P>
<P>All the&s;e little Di&s;&s;atisfactions, and Strife of parties for Elections, would die as Effects, the Original Strife about the Center of the Government, be|ing once remov'd as the Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>Occa&s;ional Conformity would be ca&s;ual and indifferent, neither worth one parties &s;training their principles to comply with, nor the other parties their Wits to explode: there would be no need of it on one Hand, nor it would be of no ill Con&s;equence on the other Hand.</P>
<P>The General Con&s;equences I draw from what I have alleag'd, are &s;uch as the&s;e.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, Tho&s;e warm Gentlemen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> who think they do GOD good Service in railing at the Di&s;&s;enters, as Subverters of the Church and of the Monarchy, and &s;how their Wit in fir&s;t painting the Robs of Rebellion in all its bloody Colours, and then dre&s;&s;ing up the Di&s;&s;enter
<PB N="12" REF="12">
in it, as if the Coat fitted none but him, are very much to blame; my Ch$|rity di&s;po&s;es me to hope they are unwilling &s;o; but certainly they are ef|fectually and eventually Enemies to the Peace of the Church, and the Pro&s;|perity of the Crown; all the Aver&s;ion of Parties is owing to them; all the ill blood which is to be found among the Di&s;&s;enters, is owing to the Menaces of the&s;e furious People, who in Print and in Pulpit, Entitle the whole Church and Government to the Exta&s;ies of their Pa&s;&s;ions, and &s;peak in the plural Number, as if they were then commanded to Cur&s;e <HI>Jacob.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e were the proper Authors of the <HI>Shorte&s;t Way,</HI> tho' &s;ome Body el&s;e may &s;uffer for it; and the&s;e Gentlemen, with humble Submi&s;&s;ion to the Go|vernment, unle&s;s of their own accord they Di&s;i&s;t, will, whenever our Rulers &s;ee their own Intere&s;t, be ordered to do it.</P>
<P>'Tis farther manife&s;t, that this Way of treating the Di&s;&s;enters can have no pre&s;ent Signification, for the Government, and Her Maje&s;ty in particular, having &s;ufficiently te&s;tify'd their Abhorrance of de&s;troying, hanging, or ba|ni&s;hing all the Di&s;&s;enters; To what purpo&s;e then can be the Treating them with &s;o much indecent Contempt, and keeping them in con&s;tant Alarms from the perpetual menacies of the Pulpit? No Indignation of the Clergy, or any Body el&s;e can hurt them, while Her Maje&s;ty thinks Her Self oblig'd to promi&s;e them Liberty and protection.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides, it &s;eems indecent, that when the Crown indulges them, the pul|pit &s;hou'd threaten them; that the Clergy &s;hould per&s;ecute them from the pre&s;s, when the Government tolerates them from the Law; this Way of the&s;e Gentlemen treating the Di&s;&s;enters, can have no Signification but what looks di&s;$oyal and di&s;re&s;pect$ul to the Queen, and manife&s;tly turns to their own Di&s;advantage, as to Character, and to the Di&s;advantage of the Govern|ment, who&s;e undoubted Intere&s;t it is, to have a free and intire Love, and un|interrupted Confidence in all its Subjects.</P>
<P>Secondly, If this Doctrine be true, then the Di&s;&s;enters have been Ill man|ag'd, and it is in the power of the Government to make them all Zealous, Hearty and Loyal to the pre&s;ent E&s;tabli&s;hment, in every part of it, to make the Di&s;&s;enters ea&s;ie, and them&s;elves e$&s;ie with them; and the Governing power, yet remain, not only by a Right, but by a voluntary, true Conce&s;&s;ion of parties; That the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hall not only obey the pre&s;ent Authority, but choo&s;e it, love it, and believe it to be the be&s;t, and the be&s;t for them; and that if it were di&s;&s;olv'd to Morrow, would be the fir&s;t Men in the Na|tion to re&s;tore it to the very &s;ingle, undivided po&s;t$$e it now flouri&s;hes in, and to maintain it there.</P>
<P>The Queen would be &s;erv'd with an undivided Loyalty, without concern|ing them&s;elves who &s;hall come next; all parties will earne&s;tly pray, that Her Maje&s;ty may continue long, and the Glory &s;he will obtain by bringing about $o happy, &s;o unexpected a Union of divided parties, &s;hall be greater in Ages yet to come, than all the Conque&s;ts of Her Armies, or the Succe&s;s of this doubtful War.</P>
<P>It any &s;hou'd be &s;o weak, as to &s;ay Her Maje&s;ty does not de&s;ire any &s;uch Union, tho' the Notion is too ab&s;$rd to merit any Remark, yet it leads me to take Notice, that really, whatever Her Maje&s;ty de&s;ires, there are &s;ome people who certainly do not de&s;ire it.</P>
<P><PB N="13" REF="13">
There can be no Body in the Nation but mu&s;t de&s;ire this Union, but &s;uch as are for <HI>The Shorte&s;t Way.</HI> &punc;Tis manife&s;t, the Government under&s;tands the General Intere&s;t of the Nation too well, not to de&s;ire &s;uch a Union: 'Tis plain, Her Maje&s;ty has expre&s;s'd Her Re&s;entment at the Sugge&s;tion of any thing Cruel to any of Her Subjects; and Her often expre&s;&s;ing Her Royal Tenderne&s;s for all Her Subjects, puts it out of doubt, She would be glad to &s;ee them all in the &s;ame path to Heaven with her &s;elf; but while She can|not Hope for that, She cannot but de&s;ire to &s;ee them &s;haking Hands, and united in Hearts in the Journey, tho' the Steps they take are in different parallels.</P>
<P>And her Maje&s;ty cannot but be pleas'd to &s;ee that all Her Subjects, of what|&s;oever Opinion in Matters of Religion, &s;hould joyn in a more than ordinary Zeal and Affection for both Her per&s;on and Government.</P>
<P>Another Inference from the premi&s;es, is this; Tho&s;e Di&s;&s;enters who co|vet places and perferment in the Government, and encrea&s;e the Scandal of their principles, on Account of Occa&s;ional Conformity for that End, are al&s;o to blame, e&s;pecially at &s;uch a time as this.</P>
<P>If it be the True Intere&s;t of the Di&s;&s;enters to be under the Government of the Church of <HI>England</HI> Magi&s;tracy, let tho&s;e to whom places, Salaries, and Honours are of more than common Nece&s;&s;ity, and that can conform to qualifie them&s;elves for them, continue in the Church; and &s;o not only help to promote the Government they e&s;pou&s;e, but al&s;o carry on the Intere&s;t of peace, General Charity, Loyalty, and Affection to the Queen, and to the Subject of every &s;ide.</P>
<P>The Di&s;&s;enters, as Di&s;&s;enters, can have no Rea&s;on to covet places; the pretence of keeping out Men that would di&s;&s;erve the publick would be o|ver; for where there is but one undivided Intere&s;t in Government, there can be no &s;ub&s;i&s;tance for Factions and parties.</P>
<P>What then can a Di&s;&s;enter, as a Di&s;&s;enter, covet a publick Employment for&punc; 'Tis plain, 'tis his Intere&s;t the Church party &s;hould have the Govern|ment, and that if 'twas in his Hands, or offer'd to him, he could not tell what to do with it, but would petition the Church party to take it again; he can have nothing to ask, but to be &s;ure of his Liberty and property his Toleration and E&s;tate.</P>
<P>In order to this, being effectually &s;ecur'd, there wants nothing, but that the Church party be fully &s;atisfy d that he never can encroach on the Go|vernment, alter or di&s;turb it, which without damage to his own Intere&s;t mu&s;t be impo&s;&s;ible; and the Church-Man being a&s;&s;ur'd of this, can have no manner of Ground to wi&s;h the Toleration repeal'd, or the property of the Di&s;&s;enter weaken'd, becau&s;e he is a willing Subject, and always will be a Friend to the Government, from the irrefragable Rea&s;ons of his own Safety and Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>After this mutual Confidence &s;ettl'd, a Di&s;&s;enter can never de&s;ire a place in the Government, but for the profit or Honour; and if he cannot di&s;po&s;e&punc; with him&s;elf about that, he mu&s;t bring his Con&s;cience and the Sallary, or his
<PB N="14" REF="14">
Con&s;cience and the Title together, and let them make the Bargain as well as they can, the State is no way concern'd in it.</P>
<P>I &s;ee no difficulty remains, but how to procure this mutual Confidence of parties, which tho' it be remote, is far from impo&s;&s;ible; but I am in &s;o fair a Way to be ruin'd, for De&s;cribing the <HI>Shorte&s;t Way</HI> to undo us, that I &s;hall be very wary how I pre&s;cribe more <HI>Short Ways,</HI> without the Direction of my Superiors, and that Concurring&punc; I doubt not it might ea&s;ily be brought to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>But Two imediate Circ4m&s;tances would contribute a great deal towards it, and both the&s;e I have often driven at; and while any thing I &s;hall write will be read, &s;hall continue to aim at it, and this is a Communion of Cha|rity and Civility between the parties; this would make Way for a right Under&s;tanding; and tho' there are differences in Religion, there need be none in Affection, in Society, in Neighbourhood; people may be good Neighbours, good Friends, and united in Intere&s;t, tho' one goes to the Church and to4her to the Meeting-Hou&s;e; let the Strife be who lives be&s;t, and the Contention of the Clergy who &s;hall preach Be&s;t, and by this make as many parties and Factions as they plea&s;e; let them preach one another's Hearers away, and Increa&s;e and Decrea&s;e according to the Genuine, Hone&s;t Lives and Doctrines of the party, then the be&s;t Church will be the bigge&s;t Church: they who preach Be&s;t, and pracice Be&s;t, will have the mo&s;t of their &s;ide: and that Church which has the mo&s;t of its &s;ide, will &s;oon have the upper Hand, for Number always prevails.</P>
<P>Nay, it &s;eems a Reflection on both &s;ides in my Opinion, that here &s;hould be &s;uch &s;triving, &s;uch pu&s;hing at power, and making Intere&s;t by parties about Religion: let them leave Religion to Her own Methods: The <HI>Coffee-Hou&s;e</HI> and the <HI>Clubs</HI> need not be concern'd about Her, let which &s;ide &s;oever have the Choice of Sheriffs, Mayors and Parliament Men: if it mu&s;t be Re|ligion that is in Di&s;pute, let the Di&s;pute be managed as a religious One, and no otherwi&s;e: let the Lives and Doctrines of the parties alone to Fight it out: they who have the be&s;t principles, and live be&s;t up to them, will cer|tainly get the better of it at la&s;t; and if Governments and Intere&s;t of par|ties &s;tood but Neuter, it would quickly appear who are the people.</P>
<P>But to touch a little the particulars: If this Union of Intere&s;t be ever attempted, there mu&s;t be fir&s;t a Union of Charity.</P>
<P>Fir&s;t, The Di&s;&s;enters, in who&s;e Name I have pretended to &s;ay, that they are willing to live peacably and quietly under the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government, &s;hould Evidence it by practice: they, who among the Di&s;&s;enters, are di&s;turb'd at the profits and Tru&s;t of the Government being taken from them and gi|ven to the Churchmen, are to blame, are ob&s;tructors of their General peace, if not Enemies to it; for as Di&s;&s;enters, Fir&s;t, 'Tis not a Farthing Advantage to your General Intere&s;t, if it be your Intere&s;t the Church party &s;hould have the Government: and if you would all Vote for a Church of <HI>England</HI> Magi&s;tracy if it were in your Choice, Who &s;hou'd have the places and pro|fits of the Government, but tho&s;e to whom you commit the Government? To de&s;ire it otherwi&s;e would be unrea&s;onable&mdash;But the main Ca&s;e lies here, you wou4d not be excluded, as unquallify'd and dangerous people.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="15">
Without Offence, let me &s;ay one Thing: this proceeds from the Jealou&s;ies infus'd in the Church party, that you covet all, and that you would throw them out of the Saddle, to &s;et your &s;elves in: and this Jealou&s;ie proceeds from the eagerne&s;s to get into places, and the Di&s;&s;atisfaction you expre&s;s for being &s;hut out.</P>
<P>Convince them that 'tis a Mi&s;take, as indeed it mu&s;t be if you are in your Sen&s;es: and let them know, by the Effects, that they are in the Wrong, and you will then never be excluded from places as dangerous people, but, in time, be admitted equally with all the Loyal Subjects of the Nation.</P>
<P>I know no Rea&s;on a Di&s;&s;enter has to de&s;ire any Concern in the Govern|ment but the Gain of it; for if &s;ince 'twas in his power to remove the Go|vernmen$, he would place it ju&s;t where it is, he can have no de&s;ign to do it any Injury: if then the profits of places and Tru&s;t be the Ca&s;e, my Advice to the Di&s;&s;enters, is to convince the Church Men by a General Quietne&s;s, and Unanimous Concurrence with the Government, that however they are divided in principles, they are one Body of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, under that very Government both of them like, and which both of them would, if it were di&s;&s;olv'd, voluntarily choo&s;e to Erect again: that they have but one Intere&s;t one End, one De&s;ign, and can never be &s;eparated without an Injury to both have one Crown, one parliament, and are but one people, and never de&s;ire to be otherwi&s;e: and if both &s;ides came to a &s;atisfaction of this point, there would be no more excluding of parties for Religion: Te&s;ts Sacraments and occa&s;ional Conformities, which are now the Scandal of both &s;ides, would &s;ink of them&s;elves, the Cau&s;es of them would die, and the Effects could not &s;urvive; 'twould be every Man's Intere&s;t to &s;upport what was every Man's Choice to &s;et up; every Man would de&s;ire to maintain that Government which every Man would endeavour to re&s;tore; and he that in|jur'd it, would equally be abhor'd by all &s;ides.</P>
<P>But all the Work does not lie on the Di&s;&s;enters &s;ide neither; and &s;ince I have once anger'd both &s;ides, by &s;peaking under a di&s;gui&s;e, I can but run the &s;ame Fate in &s;peaking plainly</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>England</HI> Men mu&s;t put their Hand to this Work, or it will never be brought to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>Some have &s;tarted an unkind Objection in the World, That there is no real de&s;ire in the Church Party ever to come to an Accomodation with the Di&s;&s;enters.</P>
<P>This may be true of &s;ome People in the Church, but it cannot be true of the General Body of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Church, of whom, as I before made a Pro|vi&s;ional Caution, I am Treating; nor can it be true of any that call them|&s;elves Church Men, unle&s;s one of tho&s;e two Ca&s;es are in it: Fir&s;t, That they are only Incendiaries and Di&s;turbers of the Nation, who Act under the Mask of the Church Profe&s;&s;ion, but are really Enemies of both; Or, Secondly, That they are Mad men, bereav'd both of their Religious and Politick Sen&s;es.</P>
<P>We have had it Printed, with an A&s;&s;urance I have wondred at, that the moderate Members of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> call'd <HI>Low Church Men,</HI> are wor&s;e than the Di&s;&s;enters; are Fanaticks in Ma&s;querade; and po&s;&s;ibly &s;uch Men as are of that Opinion, would be as much di&s;turb'd if all the Di&s;&s;enters &s;hould conform, as if all the Moderate Church Men &s;hould turn Di&s;&s;enters&punc; becau&s;e
<PB N="16" REF="16">
then their own Principles would be exploded immediately by all good Men, and their Per&s;ons mark'd as the General Incendiaries o$ the Nation; all the Sin of Politick Schi&s;m would plainly lye at their Doors; and not only &s;o, but the moderate Gentlemen of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> are the Men of Tem|per, and of Charity, Men of Liberty, of Candor, and of Principles, and this makes them aver&s;e to Oppre&s;&s;ion and Per&s;ecution.</P>
<P>The Church of <HI>Englan$</HI> is particularly denominated from the&s;e Men; I call all that Part of the Church, moderate Men, who are true Genuine Con|formi&s;ts to the Church, in Doctrine and Di&s;cipline, but neither bigotted to their Opinions, nor tainted with Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion, who are of the Church, becau&s;e they think it s the true&s;t Way of Wor&s;hip; who &s;peaking of Religion, are Prote&s;tants, and good Chri&s;tians; &s;peaking of Politicks, are Loyal Subjects to the Crown: but withall, are <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men, and fill'd with Charity to tho&s;e who differ from them, cautious of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty, and forward not to oppre&s;s their Neighbours.</P>
<P>Nay, even Men of higher and &s;traighter Principles, who think hard of tho&s;e who Di&s;&s;ent from them, yet are not for oppre&s;&s;ing them, and to make Pretences where they cannot find them, to ruine Families for Opinion in Religion.</P>
<P>If the Church has the Government, and the Di&s;&s;enters are pleas'd with its being &s;o, what have they to de&s;ire? If they have all the Profits of it, and the Di&s;&s;enters, with Confidence, commit them&s;elves to their Protection, what can they ask more? What other Rea&s;on can tho&s;e Gentlemen, who are &s;o hot again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters, give, why they &s;hou'd be oppre&s;s'd, but their Fear of them as a Party? This fear is thus prov'd to be ab&s;ur'd and groundle&s;s, and therefore I think the Con&s;equence is plain.</P>
<P>Tho&s;e People who $rive at the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Di&s;&s;enters, cannot be Friends to the Church, nor to the Government: 'tis true, it would be better for the Church there was no Schi&s;m, no Breach on Account of Opinion: but &s;ince there is, and they cannot pretend to bring all the Di&s;&s;enters back again, un|le&s;s they will &s;et up the <HI>Shorte&s;t Way,</HI> it cannot ageee with Policy, or Pub|lick Intree&s;t, to make them unea&s;ie.</P>
<P>If they won't Conform to the Church, 'tis impo&s;&s;ible to make them: but if they will Conform to the Government, if they are not Di&s;&s;enters in Po|liticks, if they A&s;&s;ent and Con&s;ent in Publick Matters, if they acquie&s;ce with a Church of <HI>England</HI> Government, and if it were in their Power would cho&s;e it from all others, as is I think fairly prov'd, then it cannot be the Intere&s;t of the Government to di&s;turb them, and they who would cru&s;h them, ex|po&s;e them, or widen the Breach between them and the Church, cannot be Friends to the Church, or to the Government, and ought to be treated accord|ingly.</P>
