<HEAD>The COUNTY of DIEPHOLT.</HEAD>
<P>THIS county lies &s;outh of Delmenhor&s;t, between Hoya on the ea&s;t, and O&s;nabrug on the we&s;t. It is about twelve miles in length, and five in breadth, con&s;i&s;ting mo&s;tly of moors and heath, with a little arable-land. For fuel the inhabitants make u&s;e of turf. The lake, called Dummer&s;ee, abounds with fi&s;h and wild ducks. In the county are four boroughs, and about one thou&s;and nine hundred fire-places. The inhabitants make a coar&s;e linen, and al&s;o a coar&s;e kind of woollen, in which, and black cat|tle, they have &s;ome traffic. Their religion is Lutherani&s;m. In the matricula, the king of Great-Britain is taxed for this county at one hor&s;e and four foot, or twenty-eight florins, monthly; but in re&s;pect of the chamber-judicatory, it is in|cluded
<PB N="4" REF="30">
in the &s;um paid for the whole electorate. It has &s;eat and voice in the college of the We&s;t|phalian counts of the empire, and at the diets of the circle. The taxes are much the &s;ame as in the county of Hoya, except that it pays no magazine|corn money. The di&s;tricts of Auburg and Wa|genfeld, in this county, are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, at pre&s;ent, by the landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el; but his right to them is di&s;puted by the king of Great-Britain.</P>
<P>Deepholt, from which the county takes its name, and the only place in it worth mentioning, is a large borough, &s;ituated on the Hunte.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY of SPIEGELBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This &s;mall county makes a part of the principa|lity of Calenberg; but the prince of Orange, he|reditary &s;tadtholder of the United Provinces, holds it of the elector of Hanover, as &s;uperior. Both the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical judicatories are &s;ubordi|nate to tho&s;e of Brun&s;wic-Lunenburg. The coun|ty al&s;o contributes its quota towards the mainte|nance of the troops of Brun&s;wic-Lunenburg. The elector, as &s;uperior of the county, has a &s;eat and voice in the college of the We&s;tphalian counts of the empire, and al&s;o at the diets of the circle. Its quota of the imperial and circle taxes is included in that of Calenberg.</P>
<P>Spiegelberg, from which the county takes its name, and the only place in it worth notice, is an antient ca&s;tle on a mountain, in which the counts formerly had their re&s;idence. Near it is an ho&s;pital for old women, and a chapel, to which many pilgrimages are made, on account of an image of the virgin.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTY RIETBERG, or RITTBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded to the &s;outh by the county of Lippe, to the north by that of Raven&s;|berg, to the ea&s;t by the bi&s;hopric of Paderborn, and to the we&s;t by that of O&s;nabrug. Its greate&s;t length is about &s;eventeen miles, and breadth about &s;ix. The &s;oil, for the mo&s;t part, con&s;i&s;ts of heath. Count Kaunitz-Rietberg, who is proprietor of the county, holding it as a fief of He&s;&s;e, enjoys both &s;eat and voice in the We&s;tphalian college of the counts of the empire, and al&s;o at the diets of the circle. His a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the empire is &s;ix hor&s;e, or &s;eventy-two florins, monthly, in lieu of them; and to the chamber-court he pays, each term, &s;eventy rix-dollars, forty-nine kruitzers.</P>
<P>Rietberg, from which the county takes its name, is a &s;mall town on the Ems, near which, on the &s;ame river, is the ca&s;tle of Eden.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>The COUNTY of PYRMONT.</HEAD>
<P>This county is bounded to the north and ea&s;t by the Hanoverian di&s;trict of Erzen, to the &s;outh and we&s;t by the Wolfenbuttel di&s;trict of Otten&s;tein, a part of Hanover, the county of Lippe, and the bi&s;hopric of Paderborn. It is about twelve miles both in length and breadth, and con&s;i&s;ts mo&s;tly of a beautiful valley, &s;urrounded by high green hills, in which is a &s;alt-work, the celebrated mine|ral &s;prings, and &s;teel waters. On one of the high|e&s;t of the hills are to be &s;een the ruins of Hermans, or Harmin's burg, a fort, which took its name from the antient German general Arminius. The inhabitants of this county are Lutherans, and have a &s;uperintendent at the new town of Pyrmont. By
<PB N="6" REF="50">
a &s;tipulation with the bi&s;hopric of Paderborn, in 1668, it was agreed, that in ca&s;e the male-&s;tock of the hou&s;e of Waldeck, to whom this county belongs, &s;hould become extinct, the bi&s;hop &s;hould &s;ucceed, on payment of twenty thou&s;and rix-dollars, to the daughters of Waldeck. At the &s;ame time the &s;eigniory of Lugde, or Lude, was ceded to the bi&s;hopric. This county entitles its lord to a &s;eat and voice, in the college of counts, at the diets of the empire, and circle. In the ma|tricula he is a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed at fourteen florins, and to the chamber-court, at &s;eventeen rix-dollars, &s;ixty|&s;even kruitzers, each term. His revenue from this county amounts to about thirty thou&s;and rix-dol|lars, ari&s;ing chiefly from the mineral-waters and &s;alt-work. The only place in it of any note is the New Town of Pyrmont, near which is a citadel, fortified with a broad ditch, high ramparts, and &s;ubterraneous pa&s;&s;ages and vaults. On the north &s;ide of the town is a good &s;tone quarry, and in that a pit, re&s;embling the grotto del Cane near Na|ples; over which, in 1720, a &s;tone vault was built. But that for which it is mo&s;t famous are its mineral-waters, i&s;&s;uing from &s;everal &s;prings in the neighbourhood. That chiefly u&s;ed for drink|ing has a hou&s;e built over it. Another, called in German the Brodelbrun, or the Bubbling-&s;pring, from the noi&s;e it makes, has hitherto been u&s;ed only for bathing. There is a great re&s;ort to the&s;e chaly|beate waters, which are even preferred to tho&s;e of the Spaw, and exported in large quantities from Bremen, whither they are &s;ent by the We&s;er, be|&s;ides what is carried over land, and drank at the fountain-head. Clo&s;e by the well-hou&s;e is a ball and a&s;&s;embly-room.</P>

It is upwards of a dozen miles both in length and breadth, and yields excellent pa&s;turage; in con&s;equence of which it has a good breed of cattle and hor&s;es, with butter and chee&s;e, not inferior to the Dutch. It is well &s;upplied with turf for fuel, but is much expo&s;ed to inun|dations from the &s;ea; to guard again&s;t which, dykes have been erected at a con&s;iderable expence.

<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of COLOGNE, or COLEN,</HEAD>
<P>This city, called in Latin Colonia Agrippina, and Ubiorum, and by the Germans Kewlen, &s;tands on the Rhine, twenty miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Du&s;&s;el|dorp, &s;ixty ea&s;t of Mae&s;tricht, &s;ixty-eight north of Triers, &s;eventy &s;outh of Mun&s;ter, eighty-two north-we&s;t of Mentz and Nimeguen, one hundred from Bru&s;&s;els and Antwerp, and one hundred and twenty from Am&s;terdam. It is one of the olde&s;t and large&s;t, as well as mo&s;t antient cities in all Germany, and derives its pre&s;ent name from that of Colonia, given it by the Romans, under whom it was the capi|tal of Germania Secunda. It is a free imperial city, governed by its own &s;enate, in re&s;pect to civil mat|ters and cau&s;es; but the criminal juri&s;diction belongs to the elector and his chapter. In the magnificent, but unfini&s;hed cathedral of St. Peter, is a tomb, in which the three wi&s;e men are &s;aid to be interred. Be&s;ides the cathedral, there are ten collegiate, and nineteen pari&s;h churches, four abbies, &s;eventeen mona&s;teries, thirty-nine nunneries, &s;ixteen ho&s;pi|tals, and about fifty chapels. Here is a very flouri&s;hing univer&s;ity, re-e&s;tabli&s;hed by Urban VI. in 1388. Tho' the elector, by his officers, ad|mini&s;ters ju&s;tice in all criminal cau&s;es, yet &s;o jea|lous are the citizens of him, that they will not per|mit him, in per&s;on, to re&s;ide above three days at a time in the city, nor to come into it with a great train. For this rea&s;on he commonly re&s;ides at Bonne. In 755 Cologne was made an archbi&s;hop|ric, and in 1260 entered into the Han&s;eatic league. It has the precedence of all the imperial cities, and is fortified, but in the antient manner; &s;o that it
<PB N="15" REF="140">
might be ea&s;ily taken by whoever was ma&s;ter of the field. Mo&s;t of the inhabitants are papi&s;ts; but there are al&s;o many prote&s;tants, who repair to the neighbouring town of Mulheim, in the duchy of Berg, for public wor&s;hip. Its trade, which is con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in Rheni&s;h wine, is chiefly in the hands of the prote&s;tants, and carried on by the Rhine. The &s;hips, wherewith they trade to the Netherlands, are of a particular form, and con&s;iderable burthen. In the council-hou&s;e, which is a large Gothic building, are many fine paintings, together with bows, arrows, bucklers, and all &s;orts of antique arms, particularly a cro&s;s-bow of whalebone, twelve feet long, eight inches broad, and four inches thick. In the church of St. Ur|&s;ula, they pretend to &s;hew her tomb, and the bones of the eleven thou&s;and pretended virgin-martyrs, tho' that &s;tory is entirely owing to a mi&s;take. The heads of &s;ome of the&s;e imaginary martyrs are kept in ca&s;es of &s;ilver, others are covered with &s;tuffs of gold, and &s;ome have caps of cloth of gold and velvet. Brevat &s;ays, he &s;aw between four and five thou&s;and &s;culls, decked with garlands and coro|nets, and ranged on &s;helves. The city &s;wears al|legiance and homage to a new elector, &s;o long as he continues to protect them in their ju&s;t rights and privileges. The univer&s;ity is under its juri&s;|diction. The canone&s;&s;es of St. Ur&s;ula, who mu&s;t be all counte&s;&s;es, have a hand&s;ome income, ex|clu&s;ive of offerings. In their church they pretend to &s;hew three of the thorns of our Saviour's crown, and one of the ve&s;&s;els that contained the water, which he converted into wine, at the marriage of Cana. In the church of St. Gereon are nine hun|dred heads of Moori&s;h cavaliers, &s;aid to have been in the army of Con&s;tantine, before it was convert|ed to Chri&s;tianity, and to have been beheaded for refu&s;ing to &s;acrifice to idols. Every one of the
<PB N="16" REF="150">

In the Je&s;uits college are the portraits of the thir|teen fir&s;t generals of the order, with Ignatius Loy|ala at their head, and in their church, which is the fine&s;t in Cologne, are many fine &s;tatues, with an amazing quantity of rich &s;ilver-plate; and the uten|&s;ils for ma&s;s are all of gold, enriched with precious &s;tones. In the Cordeliers-church is the tomb of the famous Duns Scotus, &s;urnamed doctor Sub|tilis, with this epitaph: <HI>Scotia me genuit, Anglia me &s;u&s;cepit, Gallia me docuit, Colonia me tenet.</HI> The three kings, or wi&s;emen, lie in a large purple &s;hrine, &s;pangled with gold, &s;et up on a pede&s;tal of bra&s;s, in the middle of a &s;quare mau&s;oleum, faced within and without with marble and ja&s;per. It is opened every morning at nine o'clock, if two of the canons of the cathedral are pre&s;ent, when the&s;e kings are &s;een lying at full length, with their heads bedecked with a crown of gold, garni&s;hed with precious &s;tones. Their names, which are Ga&s;par, Melchior, and Baltha&s;ar, are in purple characters, upon a little grate, of the &s;ame metal with that before the &s;hrine, which is adorned with an infinite number of large, rich pearls and pre|cious &s;tones, particularly an oriental topaz, as big as a pigeon's egg, valued at above thirty thou&s;and crowns. Over again&s;t them are &s;ix large branches of &s;ilver, with wax candles, which burn night and day. The bones of the&s;e men, we are told, were brought to Con&s;tantinople, by Helena, the mo|ther of Con&s;tantine; from thence to Milan, by Eu&s;torpius, bi&s;hop of that &s;ee, and afterwards hither by archbi&s;hop Rainold. The clergy here are va&s;tly numerous, and have plentiful revenues, but very little to do. The city is &s;aid to have up|wards of twenty gates; but the &s;treets, in general, are dirty and badly paved, and the windows com|po&s;ed of &s;mall round bits of gla&s;s. Baron Polnitz

<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of AIX-LA-CHAPELLE.</HEAD>
<P>This city, called in Latin Aqui&s;granum, A|quae, or Urbs Aquen&s;is; by the Germans Aachen, Achen, and Aach; by the French Aix-la-Cha|pelle, &s;tands fifteen miles north-ea&s;t of Limbourg, thirteen &s;outh-we&s;t of Juliers, twenty-eight ea&s;t of Mae&s;tricht, twenty-&s;ix ea&s;t of Liege, twenty-eight &s;outh-we&s;t of Cologne, and about twenty north-ea&s;t of the Spaw. Its German and Latin names are probably derived from its warm baths, for which it was famous even in the time of the Ro|mans.
<PB N="18" REF="170">
That of Aqui&s;granum is &s;uppo&s;ed to be derived from Serenius Granus, lieutenant-general of Gallia Belgica, who having di&s;covered the &s;prings here in 53, built baths after the Roman fa&s;hion, and a palace near them; but the city having been de&s;troyed by the Huns, lay in ruins, till it was re|built by Charlemagne, who made it the &s;eat of his empire on this &s;ide the Alps, building a palace, repairing the baths, and ordaining, that the future kings of the Romans &s;hould be crowned here with an iron crown, at Milan with one of &s;ilver, and at Rome with one of gold; which, tho' ob&s;erved for a while, hath been long &s;ince di&s;u&s;ed. This city, however, is reckoned the principal of the impe|rial cities, and is the place where the emperor ought to be crowned, and al&s;o where he ought to re&s;ide. Accordingly it calls it&s;elf, and by the Roman emperors and kings, is called, the Royal Chair, i. e. the throne, or re&s;idence, and free city of the Holy Roman Empire, having the keeping, and that properly, in the church of St. Mary, founded by Charlemagne, of a part of the jewels of the empire, which are commonly u&s;ed at the coronation of a Roman king, or emperor, namely, of Charlemagne's &s;word, a book of the Go&s;pels, and a golden ca&s;ket &s;et with precious &s;tones, where|in is kept &s;ome of the earth, on which the blood of St. Stephen dropt at his martyrdom. Here, in 16$8, was concluded that famous treaty between France and Spain, and another very lately between France and Great-Britain. Many councils were held at this place in the time of Charlemagne and Lewis the Pious. The greate&s;t part of the inha|bitants are Roman catholics; but there are al&s;o many prote&s;tants, both Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts, who are obliged to go to church to Vaels, about two miles off, in that part of the duchy of Lim|burg which is &s;ubject to the Dutch. The circuit
<PB N="19" REF="180">
of the whole city is about a league and a half, and that called the inner, or little town, about three quar|ters. The town hou&s;e is one of the fine&s;t in Germany, being adorned with the &s;tatues of all the emperors &s;ince Charlemagne, and with curious hi&s;tory-paint|ings. In the city are about twenty religious orders, who&s;e hou&s;es take up almo&s;t one-third of that called the Little Town. Every regent Roman emperor is a &s;worn canon of St. Mary's church, or the cathedral, according to the example and appointment of Charlemagne; and as by the Golden Bull the co|ronation of the emperors is ordained to be here, whenever they are crowned at Franckfort, as they have been ever &s;ince Maximilian I. they prote&s;t it &s;hall be without prejudice to the privileges of this city. The cathedral is a large old fa&s;hioned Gothic pile, which was con&s;ecrated by Leo III. in pre&s;ence of Charlemagne, and three hundred and &s;ixty-five bi&s;hops. Under the altar of the choir lies the body of Charlemagne, with a white marble tomb &s;tone over it. The chief rarities and relics in this church are, 1&s;t, The gown or &s;hift worn by the Virgin Mary at the birth of our Saviour. 2d, A coar&s;e linen cloth, pretended to have been girt about our Saviour on the cro&s;s. 3d, A piece of the cord he was bound with. 4th, Some of the blood of the proto-martyr St. Stephen, richly in|cha&s;ed in gold and precious &s;tones, on which the emperors are &s;worn at their inauguration. 5th, A picture of the Virgin Mary, with our Saviour in her arms, embo&s;&s;ed on a ja&s;per, about two inches broad, and pretended to be the work of St. Luke. 6th, A manu&s;cript copy of the Go&s;pels, in golden letters, in a cover of &s;ilver gilt. Be&s;ides the&s;e, here is a number of other curio&s;ities, which we have not room to particularize. There are a great many mineral &s;prings, both hot and cold, in and about the city, much frequented by the Engli&s;h, and mo&s;t other Eu|ropean

nations, and u&s;ed, &s;ome for bathing, and others for drinking. The virtues of the waters are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Bath in Somer&s;et|&s;hire; but the water of &s;ome of them is a great deal hotter. They are impregnated with &s;ulphur, &s;alt, nitre, &s;altpetre, and alum, and give relief in a great variety of maladies. They are unplea&s;ant to the ta&s;te at fir&s;t, and mo&s;t of them have an offen|&s;ive &s;mell. The fir&s;t &s;ea&s;on for them begins about the middle of May, and the &s;econd about the mid|dle of Augu&s;t, and each continues about &s;ix weeks. The baths are, in general, neat and commodious, the accommodations and provi&s;ions good and rea&s;onable, and there is a great variety of the be&s;t company. The city has for its protectors, the emperor, and the elector Palatine, as duke of Ju|liers. Its manufactures are tho&s;e of copper and bra&s;s wares, and of cloth. Round the city lies a di&s;trict, which is under its juri&s;diction, and is beau|tifully diver&s;ified with mountains, woods, and vineyards. At a little di&s;tance from it is the free imperial foundation of Bort&s;chied, of the Ci&s;tercian order, who&s;e abbe&s;s has a &s;eat and voice at the diet of the empire. The abbey, with its &s;eigniory, are under the protection of the city of Aix-la-Chapelle, the former &s;tanding at the charming vil|lage of Bortchied, or Portchied, in which are like|wi&s;e many hot &s;prings and baths. The&s;e have no di&s;agreeable &s;mell, and are not only bathed in, but drank. The reliques in the great min&s;ter-church in the city, are &s;hewn only at the jubilee, once in &s;even years, or at the reque&s;t of &s;ome great per&s;on|age, when they are taken out, and put in, in the pre&s;ence of the whole &s;enate and chapter. The windows of this church are curiou&s;ly gilt, and its pavement is of chequered marble. It contains al&s;o an immen&s;e trea&s;ure of ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver gilt, copes embroidered with pearl, and
<PB N="21" REF="200">
other rich ve&s;tments. The four fir&s;t reliques men|tioned above are kept in a che&s;t of &s;ilver and gold, curiou&s;ly engraved. At the entrance of the choir is a pulpit covered with plates of gold and &s;ilver, and adorned with precious &s;tones. The altar al&s;o of the choir is covered with plates of gold, repre|&s;enting our Saviour's pa&s;&s;ion; and in the upper part of the church is a throne, or chair, of white marble, &s;uppo&s;ed to have been placed there by the emperor Charlemagne, in which the emperors u&s;ed to &s;it, when they were con&s;ecrated, and re|ceived the homage of the electors and chapter. Aix la-Chapelle, being an imperial free city, has a &s;eat and voice at the diets of the empire, and circle. Its a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment in the matricula is only one hundred florins; and its quota towards the mainte|nance of the chamber-court, one hundred and fifty|five rix-dollars, fifty kruitzers, each term.</P>

<HEAD>IMPERIAL CITY of DORTMUND.</HEAD>
<P>This city, in Latin Tremonia, lies in the coun|ty of the Mark, thirty-four miles &s;outh of Mun&s;ter, and is pretty large, but not very well built. It is an imperial city, and, as &s;uch, enjoys both &s;eat and voice at the diets of the circle, and al&s;o at tho&s;e of the empire, on the Rheni&s;h bench of the col|lege of the imperial cities. Its a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment in the matricula is ninety-&s;ix florins, and to the chamber|court, each term, one hundred and eight rix-dol|lars, twenty and a half kruitzers. Dortmund was formerly one of the Han&s;e-towns. Its territory al&s;o was formerly a county, and had lords of its own; but &s;ince 1504, hath been entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the city. Here are four Lutheran churches, one nunnery, two mona&s;teries, and one of the three archigymna&s;ia, as they are called, of We&s;t|phalia. The city is populous and rich, having a
<PB N="22" REF="210">

<HEAD>THE CIRCLE of the LOWER RHINE.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle is bounded by that of We&s;tpha|lia, the Upper-Rhine, Franconia, Swabia, and Burgundy; as al&s;o by Lorrain and Al&s;ace, dividing the circle of the Upper-Rhine. The &s;tates thereof are the three &s;piritual electors, the elector Palatine, the duke of Aremberg, the prince of Taxis, the Teutonic bailiwic of Coblenz, the prince of Na&s;&s;au-Dietz, on account of the &s;eigniory of Beil&s;tein, the elector of Treves, on account of Lower-I&s;enburgh, and the count of Sinzendorf, on account of the burgraviate of Rheineck. The independency of the town of Gelnhau&s;en is di&s;puted. The diets of this circle are held at Frankfort on the Maine; and the elec|tor of Mentz is the &s;ummoning prince and director of it. It is one of tho&s;e called the Anterior-Circles; and its contribution to the empire has generally been equal to that of the Upper-Rhine. With re&s;pect to religion, it is reckoned among the mixed.</P>

<HEAD>MENTZ.</HEAD>
<P>The dominions of the elector of Mentz are, in general, fruitful. The proper archbi&s;hopric yields corn, cattle, excellent wines and fruits, e&s;pecially almonds, che&s;nuts, and filberts; and in &s;ome places good &s;alt, flax, and tobacco, iron mines, and plenty of wood. The principal rivers by which it is watered are the Rhine, the Maine, the Jaxt, and the Lhan. In the proper archbi&s;hopric there are no provincial &s;tates, except on the Eichsfeld, and the nobility belong to the immediate knight|hood of the empire. The predominant religion of the electorate is the Roman catholic, but in &s;everal places there are &s;till many prote&s;tants. The Jews are tolerated in every part of it except on the Eichsfeld, and in the territory of Erfurt. As the country is under the dominion of an eccle&s;ia&s;tic, the reader need not be told, that almo&s;t the whole property thereof belongs to prie&s;ts, monks, and nuns; and that all places and offices are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the clergy. For the education of youth, be|&s;ides the Je&s;uits colleges, there are the univer&s;ities of Mentz and Erfurt. The archbi&s;hopric is not altogether without manufactures, particularly tho&s;e of woollen and linen cloth, gla&s;s-mirrors, and por|celain, in which, and in wine, almonds, che&s;nuts, nuts, flax, and tobacco, a con&s;iderable trade is carried on. The pre&s;ent elector endeavours, in the mo&s;t commendable manner, to make commerce flouri&s;h both at Mentz and in all the archiepi&s;copal countries. This prelate is cho&s;en by the chapter, and &s;wears to a capitulation. He is not only the fir&s;t archbi&s;hop, but al&s;o elector of Germany, in con&s;equence of his being arch-chancellor of the
<PB N="24" REF="230">
empire. He is vi&s;itor of all the courts of the em|pire, director of its po&s;ts, and guardian of the ar|chives and matricula. He crowns the emperor, nominates a vice-chancellor of the empire, and holds a chancery at the imperial court; to him al|&s;o all foreign princes and &s;tates direct what propo|&s;itions they make to the empire, as well as apply for the redre&s;s of grievances. His a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in the chamber court are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the fir&s;t place. For the maintenanee of this court, he pays, each term, nine hundred rix-dollars, twenty-one kruitzers. In &s;pirituals he &s;tands immediately under the &s;ee of Rome. The bi&s;hoprics &s;till &s;ubject to his juri&s;|diction, are tho&s;e of Worms, Spire, Stra&s;burg, Con&s;tance, Aug&s;burg, Chur or Coire, Wurtz|burg, Eich&s;tadt, Paderborn, Hilde&s;heim, and Fulda. For the government of the country, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, the chief colleges are the privy-conference, the privy-chancery, the aulic-council, and the rever&s;ion-judicatory, to the la&s;t of which appeals lie from the inferior judicato|ries. The revenues of the elector are &s;aid to amount to about one hundred thou&s;and pounds, ari&s;ing chiefly from the tolls on the Rhine and Maine, the tax on wine, and that paid by the Jews. He is able to maintain five or &s;ix thou&s;and men at all times; but, to &s;ave unnece&s;&s;ary expence, &s;eldom keeps above half that number of regular troops; for his income, when he is only archbi|&s;hop of Mentz, without commendams, which is &s;eldom the ca&s;e, will allow of no greater &s;tate or expences; and his hou&s;hold is &s;uited rather to his &s;acred than his temporal character. In the city of Mentz, the circle of the Upper Rhine fre|quently keeps a garri&s;on, and in Erfurt both the emperor and elector keeps one. Of the electoral dominions in this circle, the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places are,</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="240">
Mentz, which &s;tands on the Rhine, near where the Maine falls into it, and is the capital of the archbi&s;hopric and electorate. It is called in Latin Moguntia and Moguntianum, and in French Mayence, and &s;tands fifteen miles we&s;t from Frankfort, twenty north from Worms, forty-eight from Heidelberg, forty-five from Spire, one hundred and eighty-&s;ix from Stra&s;burg, &s;ixty from Triers, and &s;eventy-four from Cologne. The city is pretty large and populous; but mo&s;t of the &s;treets are narrow, the hou&s;es old fa&s;hioned, and the fortifications remain &s;till unfini&s;hed. The elector has &s;everal palaces in and about the city, with fine gardens. It was made an archbi&s;hopric in 729 by Pepin and pope Gregory III. The ca|thedral, which is a lofty vaulted building, in the year 1755, was ornamented a-new, and furni&s;hed with windows. Be&s;ides the cathedral, here are many collegiate and other churches, with &s;everal mona&s;teries, nunneries, and ho&s;pitals, an univer|&s;ity founded in the years 1477 and in 1482, by the elector Diether, a bridge of boats over the Rhine, manufactures of &s;tockings and &s;tuffs, and two yearly fairs e&s;tabli&s;hed by the pre&s;ent elector, who endeavours, in the mo&s;t commendable man|ner, as we ob&s;erved above, to make commerce flou|ri&s;h both here and in the re&s;t of his dominions. This city claims the invention of the art of printing, which if not invented, was at lea&s;t much improved here by John Fau&s;t, or, as others &s;ay, by John Guttenburg, about the year 1450. The ve&s;tments in which the electors &s;ay ma&s;s are extremely rich, and the ca|nopy under which the ho&s;t is carried in proce&s;&s;ion, is entirely covered with pearl. There is a beau|tiful key along the river, defended by cannon. In the cathedral are &s;ome fine monuments, and a con|&s;iderable trea&s;ure. On its windows and tho&s;e of
<PB N="26" REF="250">
the palace, are painted a wheel, which is a part of the elector's coat of arms. The charter-hou&s;e here is one of the fine&s;t in Europe, both for its buildings and &s;ituation, having apartments large and commodious enough to lodge a &s;overeign and his retinue, and &s;ituated on an eminence fronting the Rhine. At the foot of this hou&s;e, &s;tands the Favorita, a &s;mall but elegant electoral palace, with mo&s;t charming gardens. Mentz has a flouri&s;hing trade, e&s;pecially in Rheni&s;h wines, of which the vineyards in this neighbourhood yield the be&s;t, particularly tho&s;e of Hockam, whence the fine&s;t &s;ort of Rheni&s;h wine has got the name of Old Hock.</P>

Others reject this &s;tory as fabulous; and think the tower was &s;o called, from the Germans giving the name of rats to the officers that were placed in it, to levy the toll, old buildings being generally called rats-ne&s;ts.</P>

Several diets of the empire have been held here. In 1664, the city was be&s;ieged and taken by the elector of Mentz, with the help of the French and Lorrain troops. But by &s;tipula|tions with the elector and princes of Saxony, who were protectors of the city, its privileges were in a great mea&s;ure &s;ecured to it.

<HEAD>The EICHSFELD.</HEAD>
<P>That part of the electorate, called the Eich&s;|feld, is &s;urrounded by He&s;&s;e, Thuringia, the prin|cipalities of Grubenhagen and Calenberg. It ex|tends about thirty miles in length, and twenty in breadth, and is divided into the upper and lower Eichsfeld, the former mountainous, but healthy and populous: the latter, tho' not enjoying perhaps &s;o pure an air, is more level, warm, and fruitful, abounding in corn, cattle, flax, and tobacco. Great quantities of linen and &s;erge are made in the upper, in which the rivers Leine, Lutter, Un|&s;trut, Wipper, and Rume have their &s;ource. The Thuringian language is &s;poken in the upper, but in the under the lower Saxon. In both are four ci|ties, three boroughs, and one hundred and fifty villages. The diets, which con&s;i&s;t of the repre|&s;entatives of the abbies, nunneries, and certain towns, with the nobility, are held, if the weather will permit, in the open air, at a place near Jage|banks-Warte, if not, in the council hou&s;e at Heiligen&s;tadt. There are a few prote&s;tants in the Eichsfeld, but the prevailing religion is the Ro|man catholic. With regard to eccle&s;ia&s;tical mat|ters, the country is divided into ten provincial deaneries and eighty-one pari&s;hes, in which are two collegiate foundations, two abbies, and &s;ix nun|neries. The right of patronage in &s;ome places belongs to the archbi&s;hop, in others to the cloi&s;|ters and foundations, and in others to the nobility. At Heiligen&s;tadt are held the &s;upreme temporal courts, and there al&s;o re&s;ides the lieutenant, or ad|mini&s;trator; but the &s;eat of the archiepi&s;copal

the Palatinate on the &s;outh, Luxemburg on the we&s;t, and the Wetterau on the ea&s;t. Its ex|tent fom &s;outh to north is about eighty miles, but its breadth is very unequal. On the banks of the Rhine and Mo&s;elle, the country is populous and fruitful in corn and wine, but el&s;ewhere moun|tainous and woody, yet abounding in game and acid &s;prings, and in metals and minerals of various kinds. It is watered not only by the Rhine and Mo&s;elle, but al&s;o by the Saar and Kyll, and con|tains twenty-eight towns. The &s;tates con&s;i&s;t of the prelates or abbots, with the repre&s;entatives of the clergy, and of certain towns. The inhabitants are all papi&s;ts except in &s;uch places as the elector po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in common with other princes, where there are &s;ome prote&s;tants. Under the archbi&s;hop are five archdeacons, and, &s;ubordinate to the&s;e, twenty provincial deans. The antient Treveri from whom the city of Triers and the electorate take their name, were a very warlike people: their general, Ambiorix, cut off a whole Roman army. They wor&s;hipped Mars and Apollo, 'till Con&s;tan|tine e&s;tabli&s;hed Chri&s;tianity among them: but at what time the bi&s;hopric and archbi&s;hopric were erected is uncertain. The church of Treves, however, is commonly accounted the mo&s;t antient of Germany. The chapter which elects the arch|bi&s;hop from among them&s;elves and makes him &s;wear to a capitulation, con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ixteen capitu|lary canons, who are all of noble extraction, be|&s;ides twenty-four others, who are domiceled. At every new election, the pope receives large &s;ums for confirmation, the pallium, and for annats. The archiepi&s;copal title is, By the grace of God, archbi&s;hop of Treves, of the holy Roman empire throughout Gaul and the kingdom of Arles, arch-chancellor and elector, and al&s;o admini&s;tra|tor of Prum. He is the &s;econd elector in rank,

His matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is twenty &s;ix hor&s;e and two-thirds, and one hundred and twenty-two foot two-thirds, or eight hundred and &s;ix florins, forty kruitzers. In the diets of the circle he has the &s;econd place, and nominates one a&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of the chamber judicatory, towards the maintenance of which he contributes, each term, eight hundred and eleven rix-dollars fifty-eight kruitzers. The tolls on the Mo&s;elle and Rhine, his deme&s;nes, and his office of noble guardian of the Minors, with the taxes he lays on his &s;ubjects, are &s;uppo&s;ed to bring him in about &s;eventy thou&s;and per annum. For the government of this electorate and the ad|mini&s;tration of ju&s;tice, be&s;ides the regency and revi&s;ion court, there are the two aulic judicatories, to which appeals lie from the inferior courts. There are al&s;o two &s;piritual high courts. The hereditary officers are the mar&s;hal, the chamberlain, the fewer, and cupbearer. Among other prerogatives, this elector has power to bani&s;h excommunicated per&s;ons out of the empire, if they do not reconcile them&s;elves to the church within a year, and to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the e&s;tates of minors, till they are of age. He has al&s;o a right to reunite all the fiefs of his dioce&s;e, upon failure of heirs, to the domains of his church. His &s;ubjects may appeal to the cham|ber of the empire in all cau&s;es above a thou&s;and florins. The regular troops he maintains, be&s;ides a militia, amount to between eleven and twelve hundred, be&s;ides a life-guard of forty men. The archbi&s;hopric is divided into the upper and lower, in the former of which the mo&s;t con&s;iderable places are,</P>

thereof is hardly any where above &s;even or eight. Be&s;ides this tract, there is the county of Recklink|hau&s;en, with the duchy of We&s;tphalia, and a di|&s;trict betwixt the duchy of Juliers and the arch|bi&s;hopric of Triers. That part of the archbi&s;hop|ric which is &s;ituated on the Rhine is more fruit|ful than the others, abounding in corn and wine. The river, be&s;ides contributing to its fertility, is of very great benefit to it in other re&s;pects. The &s;tates of the electorate con&s;i&s;t of the prelates, nobi|lity, and towns; and the diets for the proper arch|bi&s;hopric are held at Bonn. The elector of Co|logne is more powerful than either of the other two eccle&s;ia&s;tical electors. His dominions con|tain fifty-two towns, and about &s;eventeen boroughs. He has the &s;econd &s;uffrage in the electoral college, and crowns the emperor, when the ceremony is performed in his own dioce&s;e, or tho&s;e of his &s;uf|fragans. His &s;ee was rai&s;ed from a bi&s;hopric to an archbi&s;hopric in the eighth century. His &s;uffra|gans at pre&s;ent are the bi&s;hops of Liege, Mun&s;ter, and O&s;nabrug, and formerly al&s;o tho&s;e of Utrecht and Minden; but he has no authority in &s;pirituals over the prote&s;tants of the bi&s;hopric of O&s;nabrug, even when he is him&s;elf bi&s;hop thereof.

It is about forty miles in length, and thirty in breadth. The lower part of it is very fruitful, yielding plen|ty of corn and cattle, and &s;ome &s;alt-&s;prings. The higher affords iron-ore, calamy, lead, copper, &s;ome &s;ilver and gold, fine woods, cattle, game, fi&s;h,

<HEAD>PALATINATE of the RHINE.</HEAD>
<P>This Palatinate is divided into two parts by the Rhine, called the Upper and Lower Palatinate. The former lies in the circle of Bavaria, and belongs to the elector thereof; but the latter, in the circle we are now treating of, belongs to the elector Palatine. The latter part is bounded to the ea&s;t by the county of Katzenellnbogen, the archbi&s;hop|ric of Mentz, the bi&s;hopric of Worms, and part of the territory of the Tuetonic order in Franconia; to the we&s;t by Al&s;ace, the duchy of Deuxponts, the county of Sponheim, the duchy of Simmern, and certain di&s;tricts of the electorate of Mentz; to the &s;outh by the duchy of Wurtemberg, and the bi&s;horpric of Spire; and to the north by a part of the archbi&s;hopric of Mentz, and the county of Katzenellnbogen. It contains forty-one towns, be&s;ides &s;everal boroughs; and its greate&s;t extent is about eighty miles. The air is healthful, and the &s;oil fruitful in corn, pa&s;turage, wine, tobacco, and all &s;orts of pul&s;e, and fruits, particularly walnuts, che&s;nuts, and almonds. This country al&s;o breeds abundance of cattle, and is well watered by the Neckar, the Nahe, and the Rhine. In the la&s;t of the&s;e, near Germer&s;heim and Selz, is found gold, the exclu&s;ive right of &s;earching for which is farm|ed out by the elector. The &s;tate of religion hath varied greatly here &s;ince the reformation, Luther|ani&s;m and Calvini&s;m having been uppermo&s;t by
<PB N="46" REF="450">
turns, till the electorate devolved to the popi&s;h branches of the family, when popery, with all its &s;uper&s;tition and mummery, was e&s;tabli&s;hed anew: &s;o that the prote&s;tant religion is now on a very pre|carious footing in the Palatinate, tho' mo&s;t of the natives are &s;till of that per&s;ua&s;ion: but the two &s;ects of prote&s;tants, namely, the Lutherans and Calvini&s;ts, have greatly contributed to their own ruin, by their mutual jealou&s;y and animo&s;ity, being no le&s;s ran|corous again&s;t one another, than again&s;t their com|mon adver&s;aries the papi&s;ts. The Lutherans reckon them&s;elves fifty thou&s;and &s;trong, and are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of about eighty-five churches; but not one half of their preachers and &s;chool-ma&s;ters have a compe|tent maintenance. The number of Calvini&s;t clergy here is e&s;timated at five hundred, and that of the Roman catholics at four hundred. Be&s;ides &s;chools and Je&s;uits colleges in this country, there is one univer&s;ity, namely, that of Heidelberg; but there is very little trade in it except in wine. Authors are divided about the origin of the name Palatines, or Pfalzgraves, as the Germans call them; but it &s;eems mo&s;t likely to be derived from the palatia, or palaces, which the old Franki&s;h and German kings and Roman emperors were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in different parts of the country, and over which they appointed &s;upreme &s;tewards or judges, who were called Pala|tines or Pfalzgraves. The countries where the&s;e Palatines kept their courts were, from them, called Palatinates, which name came at la&s;t to be appropriated, by way of eminence, to this coun|try, as being the mo&s;t con&s;iderable of them. The antient electoral line failing in 1685, the electorate devolved to Philip-William, duke of Neuburg; and upon the death of his &s;econd &s;on, Charles-Philip, to the prince of Sulzbach. This elector has the title of arch-trea&s;urer of the empire, as well as the elector of Brun&s;wic-Luneburg, and is the fifth
<PB N="47" REF="460">
in rank among the &s;ecular electors. He is al&s;o one of the vicars of the empire, alternately with the elector of Bavaria, and enjoys many other preroga|tives, for which we refer the reader to our general account of Germany. In his own dominions he di&s;|po&s;es of all vacant benefices, but allows the eccle|&s;ia&s;tical council, compo&s;ed of two clergymen and two laymen, to pre&s;ent two candidates, of which he chu&s;es one. He is al&s;o ma&s;ter of all the tythes in his dominions; but he either grants them to the clergy, or &s;alaries in lieu of them, out of the re|venues of the church. His title is pfalzgrave of the Rhine; archtrea&s;urer and elector of the holy Roman empire; duke in Bavaria, Juliers, Cleve, and Berg; prince of Mors; marquis of Bergen|op-Zoom; count of Veldens, Sponheim, the Mark, and Raven&s;berg, and lord of Raven&s;tein. His quota to the army of the empire is thirty hor&s;e, and one hundred and thirty-eight foot, or nine hun|dred and fourteen florins, monthly. To the cham|ber of Wetzlar he contributes, each term, four hundred and four rix-dollars, eighty-two kruit|zers. There is an order of knighthood in this country, viz. that of St. Hubert; the badge of which is a quadrangular cro&s;s pendant to a red ribbon, with a &s;tar on the brea&s;t. The whole of the elector's revenue, ari&s;ing from the Palatinate, the duchies of Berg and Juliers, the &s;eigniory of Raven&s;tein, and the duchies of Neuburg and Sultzbach, hath been e&s;timated at about three hun|dred thou&s;and pounds per annum. The military e&s;tabli&s;hment con&s;i&s;ts of &s;everal regiments of hor&s;e and foot, be&s;ides the hor&s;e and Swi&s;s life-guards. All the different courts and councils, u&s;ual in other countries for the different departments of govern|ment, are al&s;o to be found here. As to towns and other places in this Palatinate, the mo&s;t con&s;idera|ble are,</P>
<P><PB N="48" REF="470">
Heidelberg, the capital of the Palatinate, ten miles from Manheim, twelve from Spire, thirty|eight from Frankfort, and thirty-five from Mentz. This city is &s;ituated near the river Neckar, in a good air, and encompa&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides, except to the we&s;t, with hills covered with vines. According to &s;ome, it takes its name from Heidel, &s;ignifying a myrtle, and berg a mountain; there being, or hav|ing been, plenty of tho&s;e trees on the mountains in the neighbourhood. It is an antient city, and has been frequently be&s;ieged and taken, plundered and de&s;troyed; but the barbarity of the French here in 1689, and 1693, was &s;uch, that no per&s;on, who&s;e heart is not quite callous and in&s;en&s;ible, can think of them, much le&s;s de&s;cribe them, without &s;hud|dering. How great is the effrontery of the&s;e peo|ple to value them&s;elves upon their politene&s;s and humanity, and to charge other nations, in parti|cular the Engli&s;h, a nation di&s;tingui&s;hed for its genero&s;ity and &s;en&s;ibility, with cruelty and ferocity. With re&s;pect to their behaviour here, our propo&s;ed brevity will not allow us to be particular. Let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that it would have degraced tho&s;e whom they contemptuou&s;ly call Les &s;auvages d'Amerique, tho' they have a much ju&s;ter title to the appellation them&s;elves. What will the reader, who knows their barbarities in the&s;e and other countries, think of one of their writers, who had lately the unparalleled a&s;&s;urance to call the Eng|li&s;h, Les &s;auvages d'Europe, the &s;avages of Eu|rope? As to Heidelberg, it is at pre&s;ent a &s;mall, but well built city. The electorel palace is an old fa&s;hioned building, but &s;tanding on a hill, com|mands a fine pro&s;pect. As to the famous library here, many valuable books and manu&s;cripts were taken from it in 1622, when general Tilly made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of the town, and &s;ent to Rome, Vienna, and
<PB N="49" REF="480">
Munich. The profe&s;&s;ors of the antiently &s;o celebrated univer&s;ity here, at pre&s;ent, are partly Calvini&s;ts, and partly Roman catholics. The Calvini&s;ts have al&s;o a gymna&s;ium. Of the churches, &s;ome belong to the Calvini&s;ts, &s;ome to the Lutherans, and &s;ome to the Roman catholics, the la&s;t of whom have al&s;o &s;ix cloi&s;ters in the town, with a college of Je&s;uits. In the college called the Sapience, which belongs at pre&s;ent to the Calvini&s;ts, twelve poor &s;tudents are provided with lodgings and board. Oppo&s;ite to Heidelberg is a high mountain, on which the Romans had a ca&s;tle, and which, by &s;ome, is thought to be the Mons Pyrus, men|tioned by Aminianus Marcellinus. It is now called the Holy Mountain, from a cloi&s;ter erected on it in 1023, to which frequent pilgrimages are made. The famous tun here, which &s;tood in a cellar, under one of the towers of the electoral pa|lace, and contained &s;ix hundred hog&s;heads, was emptied, and knocked in pieces, by the French in 1688; but the elector Charles-Lewis cau&s;ed a new one to be made, which is larger.</P>
<P>Manheim, the re&s;idence of the elector, &s;tands on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Rhine, a quarter of a league from its conflux with the Neckar, and eight miles we&s;t of Heidelberg. This is now one of the fine&s;t towns of Germany, and &s;trongly for|tified; but no le&s;s than ten thou&s;and men would be required for its defence: be&s;ides, it labours un|der a want of good water and whole&s;ome air. The electoral palace is one of the mo&s;t magnificent in Europe, and contains a grand collection of paintings, brought hither from Du&s;&s;eldorp, be&s;ides antiquities and curio&s;ities, among which is the crown of the un|happy Frederic V. king of Bohemia. The three religions tolerated in the empire have churches in this city. Here is al&s;o a Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue, and a college of Je&s;uits, with a Capuchin and Carmelite
<PB N="50" REF="490">

<P>Mo&s;bach, a &s;mall town, containing a ca&s;tle, with churches belonging to the three religions, and a manufacture of cloth.

<P>Germer&s;heim, a town, with a ca&s;tle, &s;ituated on the Rhine, where it is joined by the Queich, and where is a profitable fi&s;hery, and a gold wa&s;h. The emperor Rodolph I. of Hap&s;burg, died in this town, which is &s;uppo&s;ed to be the Vicus Ju|lianus of the Romans, and gives name to a baili|wic,

<P>Frankenthal, a con&s;iderable town, formerly for|tified, but afterwards mi&s;erably laid wa&s;te, and di&s;mantled by the French. In 1750, great pri|vileges were promi&s;ed to all prote&s;tants and Ro|man catholics who &s;hould come and &s;ettle in it.</P>
<P>Oppenheim, which &s;tands on a hill near the Rhine, and was once an imperial free city. In 1688, and 1689, it was mi&s;erably laid wa&s;te by the French, as were all the other towns of the Pa|latinate; but it has &s;ince recovered it&s;elf. All the three religions have churches here.</P>

The dukes of Aremberg and Ar&s;chot are a branch of the hou&s;e of Ligne. Till 1576 they were only counts, but were then made princes of the empire, and, in 1644, dukes. They have &s;eat and voice both at the diets of the empire and circle, in the college of princes; and their a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment in the matricula is two hor&s;e, and &s;ix foot, or forty-eight florins, monthly, in lieu of them. To the cham|ber-court, each term, their quota is eighty rix-dollars and &s;ixty kruitzers.

The &s;tates of it are the following: the bi&s;hoprics of Worms and Spire; the provo&s;t&s;hip of Wei&s;&s;enburg; the bi&s;hoprics of Stra&s;burg, Ba&s;il, and Fulda; the commandery of the order of St. John; the princely abbey of Prum; the provo&s;t&s;hip of Odenheim; the electoral pala|tinate of Simmern, Lautern, and Veldenz; the palatinate of Deuxponts, He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt, Hersfeld, and Spanheim; the mar|gravates of Nomeny, Salm with Kirburg, Na&s;&s;au-Weilburg, Na&s;&s;au-U&s;ingen, Na&s;&s;au-Id&s;tein, Na&s;|&s;au-Saarbrucken, and Otweiler, Waldeck, Hanau-Munzenburg, Hanau-Lichtenburg, Solms-Ho|hen&s;olms, Solms - Braunfels, Solms - Rodolheim, Solms-Laubach, and the electorate of Mentz, on account of Konig&s;tein, Stolberg, on account of Konig&s;tein, I&s;enburg-Bir&s;tein, I&s;enburg-Budingen, Wachter&s;sbach, and Meerholz; the rhinegraves of Greweiler, Grumbach, Dhaun, Leiningen-Hartenburg, Leiningen-We&s;terburg, Grun&s;tadt, Munsfelden, Witgen&s;tein of Witgen&s;tein, Wit|gen&s;tein-Berleburg, Falken&s;tein, Reipolzkirchen, Chriechingen, Wartenberg, Bretzenheim, Dach|&s;tuhl, and Ollbruck; with the imperial cities of Worms, Spire, Frankfort, Friedberg, and Wetz|lar, of all which we &s;hall treat in order. The bi&s;hop

of Worms, and the elector Palatine, as prince of Simmern, are joint directors and &s;ummoning princes of the circle, the late&s;t diets whereof have been held at Frankfort, but the archives are kept at Worms. With re&s;pect to religion, this circle is reckoned among the mixed. To the chamber of Wetzlar it pre&s;ents two a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors.</P>

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of WORMS.</HEAD>
<P>This bi&s;hopric being about twelve miles long, and eight where broade&s;t, lies on both &s;ides the Rhine; and, except where it terminates on the county of Katzenellnbogen, and the territory of Mentz, is environed by the Lower-Palatinate. Some parts of it are level, and fruitful in corn and wine; but, in general, it is barren, mountainous, and woody. There are &s;ome prote&s;tants in this bi&s;hopric, but they live in an oppre&s;&s;ed &s;tate; and indeed as the papi&s;ts look upon prote&s;tants as here|tics, and think them&s;elves bound to per&s;ecute them, in order to enlighten their minds, and &s;ave their &s;ouls, they have nothing but in&s;ult and in|ju&s;tice to expect from them. The regency here appoints the prote&s;tant pa&s;tors and &s;choolma&s;ters, but has no other authority in their eccle&s;ia&s;tical or matrimonial matters. In antient times the Vangi|ones inhabited this di&s;trict, and the bi&s;hop was &s;tiled in Latin, Epi&s;copus Vangionum. A bi&s;hop of this &s;ee, named Victor, is &s;aid to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted at the council of Cologn, in the year 347. The bi&s;hop|ric was much more con&s;iderable before the Refor|mation, than it is now. The revenue of it at pre|&s;ent is &s;aid not to exceed two thou&s;and five hundred pounds. The chapter, who chu&s;e the bi&s;hop, con&s;i&s;ts of thirteen capitular canons, and nine that are domiciled. In &s;pirituals the bi&s;hop is &s;ubject to the archbi&s;hop of Mentz. His matricular
<PB N="57" REF="560">
a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is two hor&s;e and thirteen foot, or &s;eventy florins monthly, in lieu of them; and to the cham|ber-court he pays, each term, fifty rix-dollars, &s;ixty|four kruitzers. The cathedral of this bi&s;hopric &s;tands in the imperial city of Worms, where the chapter al&s;o re&s;ides, and of which we &s;hall give an account afterwards. The only places be&s;ides in the bi&s;hopric, worth mentioning, are,</P>
<P>Stein, a fortre&s;s on the river We&s;chnitz, which gives name to a bailiwic.</P>
<P>Neuhau&s;en, Rhein, Turkheim, Hockheim, Dirm&s;tein, boroughs, the prote&s;tant churches in which the catholics u&s;e as freely as their own.</P>
<P>Leiningen, a town on a mountain, who&s;e citadel was de&s;troyed by the French.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of SPIRE.</HEAD>
<P>This bi&s;hopric lies on both &s;ides the Rhine, and is bounded every where by the territories of the elector-palatine, and tho&s;e of the margrave of Baa|den-Durlach. Some parts of it are woody and mountainous, but others open, level, and fruitful in corn, wine, almonds, che&s;nuts, &amp;c. It extends about thirty-two miles in length, and twelve in breadth, and is &s;aid to have been antiently the &s;eat of the Nemetes. The bi&s;hopric &s;eems to have been erected very early, but by whom is uncertain. The bi&s;hop is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Mentz, and, as a prince of the empire, has &s;eat and voice in the diets thereof, and of the circle. His ma|tricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is eighteen hor&s;e and &s;ixty foot, or four hundred and fifty-&s;ix florins, monthly, in lieu of them; and to the chamber-court he pays one hundred and &s;ixty rix-dollars, eight kruitzers, on account of the bi&s;hopric, and the provo&s;t&s;hip of Wei&s;&s;enburg. The cathedral is in the imperial city of Spire, where the chapter, con&s;i&s;ting of
<PB N="58" REF="570">
fourteen capitulars, and thirteen domicelli, al&s;o re&s;ides. The principal places belonging to the bi|&s;hopric are,</P>
<P>Philip&s;burg, a town and fort on the ea&s;t &s;ide of the Rhine. Though it belongs to the bi&s;hop of Spire, yet it is looked upon as a fort of the empire, by which the governor and commandant are ap|pointed. It has &s;tood &s;even memorable &s;ieges in the &s;pace of one hundred years. In 1734 it was taken by the French after a long and bloody &s;iege, in which the famous duke of Berwick, na|tural &s;on of king James II. of England, was killed by a cannon ball betwixt his two grand&s;ons, as he went to take a view of the trenches. The works are &s;aid to be at pre&s;ent in a very decayed &s;tate.</P>
<P>Bruch&s;al, a &s;mall town on the river Salza, nine miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Philip&s;burg, with a ca&s;tle, which is the ordinary re&s;idence of the bi&s;hop. It contains al&s;o a commandery of the order of St. John, and a &s;ecular college or foundation for im|mediate nobles of the empire, called the priory of Odenheim, becau&s;e originally founded there. The college has a particular di&s;trict belonging to it, part of which is independent of the bi&s;hop, who is patron of the college, and generally prior. In quality of the latter, he has a &s;eat and vote in the diet of the empire and circle among the prelates.</P>
<P>Rotenburg, Weib&s;tatt, and Eeide&s;heim, &s;mall towns, the fir&s;t of which has a ca&s;tle, and the la&s;t &s;tands on the Hart, the banks of which yield good wine.</P>

<PB N="59" REF="580">
1546, was converted into a temporal provo&s;t&s;hip, and annexed to the bi&s;hopric of Spire. On ac|count of it, the bi&s;hop has a &s;eat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle, and pays a matricu|lar a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of STRASBURG.</HEAD>
<P>Both the cathedral and chapter of this bi&s;hop|ric are in the city of Stra&s;burg; but the bi&s;hop commonly re&s;ides in the town of Zabern, or El&s;as-Zabern. In re&s;pect of that part of his dioce&s;e ly|ing in Al&s;ace, the bi&s;hop is &s;ubject to France; but in re&s;pect of his bailiwics on the other &s;ide the Rhine, he is &s;till a prince and &s;tate of the Ger|man empire, and as &s;uch, has a &s;eat and voice in the diets of the empire, and of this circle, paying a matricular and other a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments. In &s;pirituals he is &s;ubject to the archbi&s;hop of Mentz. His baili|wics lying on the German &s;ide of the Rhine in Swabia, contain no place of any note. We &s;hall take notice of tho&s;e in Al&s;ace when we come to treat of that country.</P>

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of BASIL.</HEAD>
<P>This bi&s;hopric, which is pretty large, lies partly in this circle and partly in Switzerland, and is bounded by the Sundgau, the county of Mompel|gard, the county of Burgundy, the principality of Neufchatel, and the cantons of Bern, Solothurn, and Ba&s;il. The inhabitants are partly prote&s;tants and partly Roman catholics, and their language partly French and partly Patois, the latter of which is a mixture of French and Italian. The &s;tates con&s;i&s;t of the clergy and nobility, with the towns and bailiwics. The bi&s;hop, who&s;e cathedral &s;tands in the city of Ba&s;il, is a prince of the empire,

having as &s;uch a &s;eat and vote in the diets of the empire, and of this circle, and paying the u&s;ual a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments. He is al&s;o clo&s;ely united, in a defen|&s;ive alliance, with the catholic cantons of Switzer|land. His chapter con&s;i&s;ts of eighteen capitulars and domicelli, and his metropolitan is the arch|bi&s;hop of Be&s;an&ccedil;on. In that part of his domi|nions which belong to this circle, the chief places are,</P>
<P>Bellelay, an abbey of Premon&s;traten&s;es, who&s;e abbot is mitred, and pre&s;ident of the provincial &s;tates.</P>
<P>Seehof, in French Elays, a &s;mall place belong|ing to the provo&s;t&s;hip of Mun&s;ter in Granfelden, which, with its &s;ubjects, is allied to and under the protection of the canton of Bern.</P>

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of FULDA.</HEAD>
<P>This bi&s;hopric is &s;urrounded by He&s;&s;e, the coun|ties of I&s;enburg and Hanau, the bi&s;hopric of
<PB N="61" REF="600">
Wurzburg, the county of Henneberg, and &s;ome di&s;tricts of the knights of the empire; being in its greate&s;t length above fifty miles, and in breadth above forty. Though it is, in general, a moun|tainous woody country, yet it is not without rich corn fields, and has al&s;o &s;everal &s;alt-&s;prings. The principal rivers, by which it is watered, are the Ful|da and the Saal. Of the inhabitants &s;ome are Lu|therans, but mo&s;t of them Roman catholics. Pope Zachary I. in 751, made the abbot of Fulda in|dependent of all epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, and &s;ubject to the &s;ee of Rome alone. Pope John XIII. made them primates of all the abbots in Germany, and the emperor Otho I. arch-chancellors to the Roman empre&s;s, upon who&s;e head they put on and take off the crown, at the coronation, and on all other &s;olemn occa&s;ions. Pope Benedict XIV. rai&s;ed the abbey to an exempted bi&s;hopric; but the bi&s;hop, as abbot, was &s;till to be &s;ubject to the rules of his order. He is a prince of the empire, and, as &s;uch, has a &s;eat and voice in the diets of the empire, and of the circle of the Upper Rhine. His matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is two hundred and fifty florins monthly, and two hundred and forty rix-dollars, four kruit|zers, each term, to the chamber-court. He is elected by the high-chapter, con&s;i&s;ting of fifteen per&s;ons, who, it is &s;aid, mu&s;t be gentlemen by &s;ix|teen de&s;cents. At his in&s;tallation he pays four hundred florins, or forty pounds, to the pope. His revenue is computed at between twenty and thirty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, and, it is &s;aid, he can rai&s;e between four and five thou&s;and men. In the territory belonging to the abbey, which is di|vided into bailiwics, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Fulda, the capital, &s;ituate on a river of the &s;ame name, forty-five miles north-ea&s;t from Hanau, and fifty from Ca&s;&s;el and Frankfort. It owes its ori|gin to the abbey, which was founded about the

middle of the eighth century by St. Boniface, and Sturm, its fir&s;t abbot, for Benedictine monks. It is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in Europe, having been endowed with great privileges by &s;everal em|perors. Here is a church dedicated to our Saviour, and another to St. Boniface, which is collegiate, with a palace for the prince, bi&s;hop, and abbot, a college of Je&s;uits, a nunnery of Benedictines, a gymna&s;ium, and a popi&s;h &s;eminary. In the year 1734, a univer&s;ity was founded here by the abbot. The abbey is &s;aid to be a &s;tately pile, but the town it&s;elf to be ill-built and dirty.</P>
<P>Brumzell, a very old town on the river Fulda.</P>
<P>Burghaun, a little town with a citadel, on the river Haun.</P>
<P>Gey&s;s, a little town on the river Ul&s;ter.</P>
<P>Dermbach, or Thermbach, a borough with a ca&s;tle and cloi&s;ter of Franci&s;cans. It is the capital of the bailiwic of Fi&s;chberg, of which the duke of Saxe-Weimar took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in 1741.</P>

<P>This ma&s;ter&s;hip or principality con&s;i&s;ts only of the town of Heiter&s;heim, and a few villages in the Bri&s;gau, belonging to the order of St. John. The grand-ma&s;ter of the order is a prince of the empire, and as &s;uch has a &s;eat and vote among the princes in the diets of the empire and circle. He pretends, as head or repre&s;entative of the order, to be &s;ove|reign of the above places; but the hou&s;e of Au&s;|tria accounts him a va&s;&s;al. Heiter&s;heim, which gives name to this petty principality, and was pur|cha&s;ed by the order in the year 1297, is a market|town, and the re&s;idence of the grand-ma&s;ter.

<HEAD>The PRINCELY ABBEY of PRUM.</HEAD>
<P>This abbey lies in the fore&s;t of Ardennes, be|twixt the bailiwics of Schoneck and Schonberg, belonging to the electorate of Triers. It was founded in the eighth century by Pepin, king of the Franks, and his con&s;ort, and in 1570 was in|corporated with the archbi&s;hopric of Triers. From that time the archbi&s;hops became admini&s;trators of it, and, as &s;uch, have now a &s;eat and vote in the diets. Their matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, on account of it, is one hor&s;emen and thirteen foot, and to the chamber of Wetzlar, eleven rix-dollars, five kruit|zers. The abbey hath lo&s;t a great part of the lands and ca&s;ualties formerly belonging to it. In the year 1361 its revenue was computed at four thou&s;and

The only places in it worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Simmern, which gives name to it, and takes its own from the river on which it &s;tands, twenty|five miles &s;outh of Coblentz, and thirty we&s;t of Mentz. Here all the three religions have churches.</P>

<P>This duchy, at pre&s;ent, con&s;i&s;ts of the antient county of Deux-Ponts, or Zwey-brucken, as it is called in the German, and &s;ome parts of the county of Veldenz. It gives title of duke to a branch of the electoral family, heretofore dukes of Berkenfield, who &s;ucceeded to it in 1733, by vir|tue of a compact with the elector, and who are en|titled by it to a &s;eat and vote in the diets of the em|pire and of this circle. Its matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is ten hor&s;e and thirty foot, or two hundred and forty florins, monthly, in lieu of them, and to the chamber of Wetzlar one hundred and &s;eventy-two rix-dollars, thirty-&s;ix kruitzers, but a part of this a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is deducted for the bailiwic of Stradecken, now belonging to the elector.

<HEAD>HESSE.</HEAD>
<P>The landgravate of He&s;&s;e is bounded by the bi|&s;hopric of Fulda, the principality of Hersfeld, Thuringia, and Eichsfeld, as al&s;o by that of Calen|burg, the bi&s;hopric of Paderborn, and Waldeck, the duchy of We&s;tphalia, the county of Witgen|&s;tein, Na&s;&s;au-Dillenburg, the county of Solins, and Upper-I&s;enburg. In the above limits, the county of Katzenellnbogen and &s;ome other terri|tories are not included. The whole country, in its utmo&s;t length, is near an hundred miles, and in &s;ome places near as much in breadth. The air is cold, but whole&s;ome, and the &s;oil fruitful in corn, wine, wood, and pa&s;ture. The country abounds al&s;o in cattle, fi&s;h, and game, &s;alt-&s;prings, baths, and mineral waters. The hills, which are many, yield &s;ilver, copper, lead, iron, allum, vitriol, pit-coal, &s;ulphur, boles, a porcelain earth, mar|ble, and alaba&s;ter. In the Eder gold is &s;ome|times found, and at Frankenberg a gold mine was formerly wrought. Be&s;ides many le&s;&s;er &s;treams, He&s;&s;e is watered by the following rivers, viz. the Lahn, the Fulda, the Eder or Schwalm, the Werra or We&s;er, and Diemel. The Rhine al&s;o and the Mayne pa&s;s through the country of Katze|nellnbogen. This country, like mo&s;t others in Germany, has its &s;tates, con&s;i&s;ting of the prelates, as they are called, the nobility, and the towns. The diets are divided into general and particular, and the latter into the greater and &s;maller committees. The hou&s;e of He&s;&s;e is divided into two principal branches, viz. Ca&s;&s;el, and Darm&s;tadt, of which Philip&s;dale, Rhinfels, and Homburg, are collate|ral
<PB N="67" REF="660">
branches, the two fir&s;t of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, and the la&s;t of He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt. Their rights and pri|vileges are very con&s;iderable. In particular, they have &s;everal votes at the diets of the empire, and cau&s;es, not exceeding a thou&s;and florins, are de|termined by the courts of the country, without appeal. The princes of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el are not of age till they are twenty-five, but tho&s;e of He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt are &s;o at eighteen. The right of pri|mogeniture hath been e&s;tabli&s;hed in both hou&s;es. The revenues of Darm&s;tadt are &s;aid to amount to near an hundred thou&s;and pounds a year, and tho&s;e of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el to near two hundred thou&s;and. The &s;mall county of Schaumberg alone yields a revenue of ten thou&s;and pounds, and that of Katze|nellnbogen, with the fore&s;ts of Richard&s;walde, it is &s;aid, was farmed near two hundred years ago at twelve thou&s;and pounds. The prince of He&s;&s;e Ca&s;&s;el has forty or fifty thou&s;and men in his dominions fit to bear arms, and the troops that he hires out have often brought him in large &s;ums, e&s;pecially from Great-Britain. The branches of Ca&s;&s;el, Homburg, and Phi|lip&s;dale, are Calvini&s;ts, that of Darm&s;tadt Luthe|rans, and that of Rhinfelds Roman catholics. The pre&s;ent prince of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, indeed, in the year 1749, embraced the Roman catholic religion; but in 1754 drew up, and confirmed by oath, an in&s;tru|ment, of which all the Prote&s;tant princes are gua|rantees, declaring, that the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of his dominions &s;hould continue in every re&s;pect as before, and that his children &s;hould be brought up, and in&s;tructed therein. Here, as in the other prote&s;tant Lutheran countries of Germany, are con&s;i&s;tories, &s;uperintendents, and in&s;pectors of the church. In the whole landgraviate are three uni|ver&s;ities, be&s;ides Latin &s;chools and gymna&s;ia, for the education of youth. The manufactures of He&s;&s;e are linen cloth, hats, &s;tockings, gloves,

paper, gold&s;miths wares, and at Ca&s;&s;el a beautiful porcelain is made. This is &s;uppo&s;ed to have been the country of the antient Catti, mentioned by Tacitus, &amp;c. who, in after-ages, were called Chatti, Cha&s;&s;i, Ha&s;&s;i, and He&s;&s;i. The two chief branches of Ca&s;&s;el and Darm&s;tadt have ma|ny rights and privileges in common, which we have not room to &s;pecify. Both of them have a &s;eat and vote in the college of princes at the diet of the empire, and tho&s;e of this circle. The matri|cular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el is one thou&s;and and ninety-&s;ix florins, forty-five kruitzers, and that of Darm&s;tadt &s;ix hundred and &s;ixty-three florins. To the chamber of Wetzlar He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el pays about four hundred and ninety-eight rix-dollars, and He&s;&s;e-Darm&s;tadt three hundred and thirteen rix-dollars, eighteen kruitzers. Each of the&s;e princes, be&s;ides their guards and militia, maintains a con&s;i|derable body, both of hor&s;e and foot. The coun|try is at pre&s;ent commonly divided into the Upper and Lower-He&s;&s;e. The principal places in the former belonging to He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el are,</P>

<P>This city, which &s;tands on the we&s;t &s;ide of the Rhine, ten miles from Manheim, and as many from Heidelberg, was antiently the capital of the Vangiones, and is called by Marcellinus, Vangio; by Antoninus, Bormilomagus; and by Ptolemy, Borbetomagus. It was at fir&s;t an archbi&s;hopric; but, in 750, pope Zachary made it &s;uffragan to Mentz, whither he transferred the archiepi&s;copal &s;ee. As an imperial city, it has a &s;eat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle, paying, as &s;uch, an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the empire, and the cham|ber of Wetzlar: yet the bi&s;hops conte&s;t its inde|pendence, and, in &s;everal re&s;pects indeed, act as &s;overeigns of it. It &s;tands not far from the Rhine, in a fine &s;pacious plain, abounding with fruit, corn, and wine, and is under the protection of the elector Palatine. The magi&s;trates, and many of the inhabitants, are Lutherans; but the Papi&s;ts have &s;everal convents and churches in it. Among the latter is the cathedral. Here is al&s;o a palace for the bi&s;hop, a Calvini&s;t church, a Je&s;uits col+lege, and a gymna&s;ium under the direction of tha$ order. The neighbourhood of the city is noted for a wine called our Lady's-milk. The bi&s;hop is ge+nerally one of the eccle&s;ia&s;tic electors, and there+fore &s;eldom re&s;ides here. The city is &s;aid to be a large as Frankfort on the Mayne, but is now i$ inhabited and poor. Several diets have been held and other important matters tran&s;acted in it; an here it was that the Reformation in 1525 began Worms has met with many misfortunes; but &s;uf+fered mo&s;t in 1689 from the French, who in

It is thought to be Julius Cae&s;ar's Nemetum Civitas, or Novio|magum, and to have been built by the Belgae long before our Saviour's time, and conquered by the Nemetes. The &s;ee, which is &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Mentz, is &s;aid to have been founded in the fourth century. The magi&s;trates of the city are Lutherans, and likewi&s;e mo&s;t of the inhabi|tants; but the Papi&s;ts have many churches and convents in it. As a free imperial city it has &s;eat and vote in the diets of the empire, and tho&s;e of the circle, paying an a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the empire and the chamber of Wetzlar. It has been entirely re|built &s;ince the year 1689, when it was totally de|&s;troyed by the French, who&s;e brutality was &s;uch, that they broke to pieces &s;everal fine marble monu|ments of emperors and empre&s;&s;es, and &s;cattered about the bones of the illu&s;trious dead. Before that fatal year it was the &s;eat of the imperial cham|ber. The name of prote&s;tants took its fir&s;t ri&s;e here at the diet held in 1529. The city will not allow the bi&s;hop to re&s;ide in it. When a new bi&s;hop is cho&s;en, before he enters the city, he re|dre&s;&s;es all complaints; and afterwards, &s;itting on hor&s;eback in the open air, betwixt the two outer|mo&s;t gates, which during the ceremony are &s;hut, with one hand on his left-brea&s;t, he pronounces a ble&s;&s;ing on the city, then binds him&s;elf not to in|fringe its privileges, but rather to maintain and in|crea&s;e them, and to live in peace and harmony

Here the emperor and king of the Romans are u&s;ually elected, and crowned; and, in the town-hou&s;e, in a ca&s;ket of gold, is kept the famous golden bull, which is written in Latin capitals, on forty-three quarto leaves of parchment, in the form of a book. The magi&s;trates, and a great part of the inhabitants, are Lutherans or Calvini&s;ts; but mo&s;t of the churches are in the hands of the Papi&s;ts, who have al&s;o &s;everal convents in the city. The other churches and convents belong to the Lutherans. As for the Calvini&s;ts, they are obliged to go to Bocken|heim, a town at a &s;mall di&s;tance, for wor&s;hip. The city has two great annual fairs, and &s;everal flouri&s;hing manufactures, particularly of &s;ilk, por|celain, and tobacco. A va&s;t number of hor&s;es, and great quantities of books, are bought and &s;old at its fairs. There are many fine palaces and public &s;tructures in the city. The Jews, who are numerous, are confined to a particular quarter. The territory belonging to the city, is of a con&s;i|derable extent; and the trade carried on by the Mayne and Rhine of great importance. The em|peror is elected in a &s;mall chapel, in the cathedral of St. Bartholomew, and crowned in another. After his coronation he dines in the town-hou&s;e; in which al&s;o the &s;tates of this circle u&s;ed formerly to

In the year 1682, the mili|tary e&s;tabli&s;hment of the whole empire, in time of peace, having been fixed at forty thou&s;and men, the quota of this circle was nine hundred and eighty hor&s;e, and one thou&s;and nine hundred and two foot; and of the three hundred thou&s;and florins granted to the operation-che&s;t of the empire in 1707, its quota amounted to twenty-two thou|&s;and &s;ix hundred and ninety-&s;ix. With regard to religion, it is one of the mixed. Of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the imperial chamber it nominates two, the one a Roman catholic and the other a prote&s;tant.</P>

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of BAMBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This bi&s;hopric is bounded to the north by the principality of Coburg and the Voghtland; to the &s;outh by the principality of Brandenburg-Bay|reuth, the territory of Nurenburg, or Nurnberg, and the principality of Schwarzenburg; to the we&s;t by the bi&s;hopric of Wurzburg; and to the ea&s;t by the territory of Nurnberg and Branden|burg-Bayreuth. The length of it is about &s;ixty miles, and the breadth forty. The &s;oil is very fertile in corn, wine, &s;affron, and liquorice, yield|ing al&s;o, in &s;ome places, laurel, fig, lemon, and orange-trees, with woods of fore&s;t-trees, and &s;ome metals. The country abounds likewi&s;e in cattle, and is well watered by the Mayne and &s;everal other rivers and brooks that fall into it. The inhabi|tants are all zealous Roman catholics. Here are no &s;tates. Before the year 1006, this country was called the county of Babenberg, and had counts of its own; but was then allotted for a bi|&s;hopric by the emperor Henry II. which pope Be|nedict VIII. exempted from all archiepi&s;copal ju|ri&s;diction. The bi&s;hop's privileges and preroga|tives are very great. He is the only one in Ger|many, who has the privilege of wearing a cardinal's hat, together with the pallium, the la&s;t of which, however, co&s;ts him four thou&s;and pounds; and there lies no appeal from his deci&s;ions in &s;ecular matters to the courts of the empire. The king of Bohemia is his cup-bearer, the elector-palatine his &s;teward, the elector of Saxony his grand-mar&s;hal, and the elector of Brandenburg his great chamberlain. The&s;e, or their proxies, if &s;ummoned mu&s;t attend, and do the duties of their offices on the day of his in&s;tallation. He is able to bring into the field four
<PB N="109" REF="1090">
or five thou&s;and men. The revenue ari&s;ing from his bi&s;hopric, be&s;ides his bailiwics in Carinthia, amounts to above fifty thou&s;and pounds. The chapter, by whom the bi&s;hop is elected, con&s;i&s;ts of twenty capitular canons, and fifteen domicelli, all of noble birth. All his e&s;tates, excepting tho&s;e in Carinthia, are held immediately of the empire. At the diet thereof he has the fourth place on the &s;piritual bench in the college of princes, and is a &s;ummoning prince and director of this circle, as we ob&s;erved above. His matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment, at pre&s;ent, is only four hundred and thirty-&s;even flo|rins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar five hundred and &s;eventy-four rix-dollars, each term. Here are all the u&s;ual courts, councils, and offices for the different departments of government, as war, foreign affairs, the finances, &amp;c. and the follow|ing are the chief places in the bi&s;hopric,</P>
<P>Bamberg, which gives name to it, and is its ca|pital, plea&s;antly &s;ituate near the river Rednitz, about thirty-four miles north of Nurenberg, and in the centre of Germany. It is &s;urrounded with walls and a ditch, and is, in general, well built and populous. Here are two epi&s;copal palaces or ca&s;tles, one called Peter&s;burg, and the other Gayer&s;werth, an univer&s;ity founded in 1648, &s;eve|ral mona&s;teries, nunneries, and churches, be&s;ides the cathedral of St. George, in which is the mo|nument of Henry II. who founded the bi&s;hopric, and his con&s;ort Cunigunda, with a trea&s;ure of jewels and relicks. Several diets both of the empire and circle have been held here. Not far from the town &s;tands the bi&s;hop's &s;ummer palace, called Mar|quard&s;burg. Among other curio&s;ities in the trea|&s;ury of the church of St. George, is a folio manu|&s;cript of the four Go&s;pels in Latin, upon fine vel|lum, in a neat Roman character, with &s;ome Go|thic

The whole is enamelled, and the intervals between the figures are garni&s;hed with pearls and precious &s;tones. The city is a great thoroughfare. A part of the road leading to it from Nurenberg lies through a fore&s;t of fir-trees, and is lined with gibbets and wheels, on which are expo&s;ed the bo|dies of &s;uch as have been executed for murders and robberies committed in the fore&s;t.</P>

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of WURTZBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This bi&s;hopric is bounded by the bi&s;hopric of Bamberg, the principality of Schwarzenburg, the county of Ca&s;tel, the Limburg &s;eigniory of Speck|feld, the principality of Brandenburg-An&s;pach, the &s;eigniory of Rothenburg, the county of Ho|henlohe, the Teutonic territory of Mergentheim, the county of Wertheim, the archbi&s;hopric of Mentz, the counties of Rieneck and Henneberg, the principality of Coburg, and the territory of Fulda. It extends upwards of eighty miles in length, and &s;ixty in breadth, and is fertile in corn, wine, fruits, plants, and pa&s;ture, and well

watered by the Mayne, the Franconian Saal, the Tauber, and Juxt. There are no provincial &s;tates here. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion is the Roman catholic, yet there are a few much oppre&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted prote&s;tants in the country. Chri&s;|tianity was fir&s;t introduced here by St. Kilian, a Scot&s;man, about the end of the &s;eventh century; and St. Burchard, the fir&s;t bi&s;hop, was appointed and con&s;ecrated by St. Boniface, who is al&s;o &s;aid to have been a Scot&s;man, and was the chief apo&s;tle of the Germans, and fir&s;t archbi&s;hop of Mentz, to which &s;ee the bi&s;hop of Wurtzburg is &s;uffragan. The bi&s;hop's title runs thus: prince of the holy Roman empire, bi&s;hop of Wurtzburg, and duke of Ea&s;t Frankenland. His revenue is &s;aid to amount to &s;ixty thou&s;and pounds a year, with which he maintains a con&s;iderable body of troops even in time of peace, with a &s;plendid court and hou&s;hold, hor&s;e and foot guards, &amp;c. being ab&s;olute in temporals, and living in all the &s;tate of a &s;overeign temporal prince; but in &s;pirituals an appeal lies from him to his metropolitan, or the pope's nun|cio. His chapter con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-two capitular canons, and thirty who are domiciled, who mu&s;t all be of noble birth, and each has an income of three thou&s;and German crowns per annum. The bi&s;hop has the honour of the pallium and cro&s;s, with a &s;eat and voice in the diets of the empire and circle. His a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the empire is eight hundred and fifty florins, and to the chamber of Wetzlar eight hundred and twenty-&s;ix rix-dollars. The chief places in the b&s;hopric are,</P>
<P>Wurtzburg, which gives name to it, and is its capital. Wurtzburg, in German, &s;ignifies a town of herbs, a great variety of which is found about it. It &s;tands in the very centre of Franconia, on the banks of the Mayne, forty miles we&s;t of Bam|berg, and is well fortified. There is al&s;o a &s;trong
<PB N="113" REF="1130">
fort near the town, containing an epi&s;copal palace, magazine, and a church; but the palace, in which the bi&s;hop u&s;ually re&s;ides, &s;tands in the town, and is a noble &s;tructure, the fir&s;t &s;tone of which was laid in the year 1720. The cathedral, together with a &s;eminary, is dedicated to St. Kilian, the pa|tron of Wurzburg and Franconia. As this city is under the dominion of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical prince, the reader need not be told, that it contains a great number of churches, mona&s;teries, nunneries, and other religious foundations. Here al&s;o is an uni|ver&s;ity founded in 1403, a hou&s;e of the Teutonic order, and another of the order of St. John, a foundery for cannon and bells, a college of Je&s;uits, and &s;everal ho&s;pitals. In the bi&s;hop's cellar are &s;aid to be more than &s;ixty tuns of curious work|man&s;hip, full of excellent old wine. At the en|trance of the bridge, over the Mayne, is a triumphal arch of hewn &s;tone. Of the abbies, one, large and magnificent, belongs to Scots Benedictines. The cathedral, an antient Gothic &s;tructure, is richly adorned within with &s;tatues, altars, pillars, &amp;c. of marble and &s;ilver, finely executed, be&s;ides paint|ings, &s;culptures, gilding, and ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver. Every thing almo&s;t is carved and gilt in the church; the pulpit, the organs, the benches for the canons, and the altars. Mo&s;t of the &s;tatues al&s;o are gilt. The great ho&s;pital of St. Julian here, is one of the riche&s;t and mo&s;t magnificent in Europe, having, it is &s;aid, a greater e&s;tate and income than the bi&s;hop him&s;elf. In the ca&s;tle is a fine train of artillery, with all the implements ne|ce&s;&s;ary for gunners, and va&s;t quantities of mu&s;|quet-balls, bombs, bullets, flints, be&s;ides a year's provi&s;ion for &s;ix thou&s;and men at arms, and forty thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot. Several diets have been held in this city, which, like mo&s;t others, has ex|perienced many calamities, and a great variety of

Jaxtberg and Hartheim have ca&s;tles. In Dittelbach is a Franci&s;can cloi&s;ter, and a celebrated image of the Virgin. In Schwarzach is a cloi&s;ter of Benedictines. In Kitzengen is an Ur&s;eline nunnery and Capuchin cloi&s;ter; but mo&s;t of the inhabitants are prote&s;tants. The Ci&s;tercian abbey of Eberach, in this bi&s;hopric, is one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable and riche&s;t in Germany.

<HEAD>Of the FRANCONIAN PRINCIPALITIES of the MARGRAVES of BRANDENBURG.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e principalities con&s;titute the burgravate of Nuremberg, in which city the antient burgraves had their &s;eat. From the&s;e burgraves, as we ob|&s;erved already, in our account of the electorate of Brandenburg, the pre&s;ent royal and princely hou&s;e of Brandenburg is de&s;cended. The burgravate is divided into the two principalities of An&s;pach and Bayreuth. The margrave of Culmbach was a collateral branch of Bayreuth; but, in the year 1726, on the extinction of the latter, became the reigning line. The title of both lines is the &s;ame as that of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, excepting the regal. Among other privileges of the margraves, is that of appointing a judge for the juri&s;diction of the bur|gravate of Nuremburg, which was antiently of great extent, but is now much more confined. The judge &s;its at An&s;pach four times a year; but an appeal lies from him to the &s;upreme tribunal of the empire, provided the &s;um in di&s;pute is above eight hun|dred guldens or guilders. The principality of Bayreuth lies mo&s;tly above the mountains called the Gebirg, and that of An&s;pach below them. Of the former, that part which lies above the Gebirg, is bounded by the bi&s;hopric of Bamberg, the &s;eigniories of Giech, and the Vogtland, the &s;eig|niory, of A&s;ch, Bohemia, the Upper Palatinate, and the territory of the imperial city of Nuren|burg. The &s;oil, though mountainous and &s;andy, is tolerably fertile. A great variety of minerals are found in it, as iron, copper, lead, vitriol, &s;ul|phur, antimony, marble of all colours, chry&s;tals, fine clay and &s;ealed earth, or terra &s;igillata; and formerly there were gold and &s;ilver mines wrought.
<PB N="116" REF="1160">
There are al&s;o &s;ome medicinal &s;prings. Of the mountains, the Fichtelberg, that is, the Pine mountain, one of the large&s;t and highe&s;t in Ger|many, is covered, in a great mea&s;ure, with pine, fir, beech, oak, elm, and lime-trees, and contains many cliffs, caves, bogs, mora&s;&s;es, and de&s;erts. Out of it al&s;o ri&s;e many rivers, as the White and Red Mayne, the Nabe, the Eger, the Ro&s;zlau, the Franconian Saale, the Pegnitz, and the Rednitz, be&s;ides le&s;&s;er &s;treams, all abounding in fi&s;h. Lu|therani&s;m is the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion of this country; but the Calvini&s;ts and Roman catholics, in &s;ome places, are allowed the exerci&s;e of theirs. Be&s;ides &s;everal Latin &s;chools and gymna&s;ia, there is an univer&s;ity at Erlang. The principal manufactures of the principality are, &s;tockings, hats, porcelain, white and brown earthen ware, and woollen cloth. Here are the u&s;ual hereditary officers, and al&s;o an order of knighthood, &s;tiled the Order of Sincerity, or, more commonly, of the Red Eagle. The margrave has a &s;eat and voice in the college of princes, at the diets of the empire, and tho&s;e of the circle. His a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the empire is three hundred and twenty-nine florins, monthly, and three hundred and thirty-eight rix-dollars, each term, to the chamber-court. For the government of the principality, and the admini&s;tration of ju&s;|tice, here are the u&s;ual councils, courts, and offices, be&s;ides a feudal court, and &s;everal mine-offices. The prince's revenues amount to upwards of five hundred and fifty guldens; but, it is &s;aid, might be improved to near double that &s;um. Be&s;ides a &s;mall body of regulars, there is a well-di&s;ciplined and regulated militia, each bailiwic and town fur|ni&s;hing its proportion. The principal places in this principality are,</P>
<P>Bayreuth, which gives name to it, and is its ca|pital, containing a magnificent palace, built &s;ince
<PB N="117" REF="1170">
the year 1753; in which the prince re&s;ides, a gym|na&s;ium, two Lutheran, and one Calvini&s;t church, a Roman catholic chapel, and a mint. The &s;eat of the high colleges is al&s;o here. In the neigh|bourhood is a pretty hou&s;e, in a wood, called the Hermitage, belonging to the prince.</P>
<P>St. Gorgen-am-See, a town on the lake called the Brandenburgh-Weyher, not far from Bay|reuth, in which the prince has a noble palace, with fine gardens. Here the marble of the coun|try is poli&s;hed, and wrought into all manner of forms. White and brown porcelain al&s;o is made here, in the latter of which gold and &s;ilver are very ingeniou&s;ly and durably annealed.</P>
<P>Streitberg, a market-town, containing a ca&s;tle, near which yellow marble is dug, and giving name to a bailiwic, in which are &s;everal remarkable caverns.</P>
<P>Culmbach, which gave name to a di&s;tinct mar|gravate till 1726, when the margrave &s;ucceeded to that of Bayreuth. It &s;tands on the White-Mayne, in a beautiful valley. Near it is the &s;trong fortre&s;s of Bla&s;&s;enburg, in which are kept the archives of the Brandenburg family; and the village of Himmelkron, where is a magnificent palace, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the White-Mayne, amid&s;t fine meadows, gardens, fields, and woods.</P>
<P>Hof, a con&s;iderable town on the Saale, contain|ing four churches, a gymna&s;ium, and a woollen manafucture, and gives name to a di&s;trict, in which a red, grey, and black marble is dug. Among the grey is a &s;ort variegated with red &s;pots, like drops of blood.</P>

<P>Erlang, one of the &s;ix head-towns, as they are called, of the principality, &s;ituate at the conflux of the Rednitz with the Schwabach, and di&s;tin|gui&s;hed into the old and new. The latter, which is al&s;o called Chri&s;tian-Erlang, having been begun by the margrave Chri&s;tian Erne&s;t, in 1686, is one of the fine&s;t towns in Germany. It lies clo&s;e to old Erlang, being almo&s;t environed with a wall of free-&s;tone, and containing a margravial palace, with a fine garden, an univer&s;ity, and &s;everal churches.

An&s;pach. It is a fruitful country, about forty miles in length; but the breadth is &s;mall in com|pari&s;on, and very unequal. The bi&s;hop is a prince of the empire, but &s;uffragan of Mentz, and has a revenue of between nine and ten thou&s;and pounds. His a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the empire is two hundred and forty-&s;ix florins, monthly; and to the chamber of Wetzlar two hundred and eighty-four rix-dollars, each term. The chapter con&s;i&s;ts of fourteen capi|tulars, and fourteen domiciled, who mu&s;t be all gentlemen by &s;ixteen de&s;cents. There are no land|&s;tates here, and the inhabitants are all Roman ca|tholics. The bi&s;hopric was founded by St. Boni|face, who made his &s;i&s;ter's &s;on Wilibald, afterwards canonized by pope Benedict XIII. fir&s;t bi&s;hop thereof in the year 745. Here are the u&s;ual here|ditary officers, and high colleges. The bi&s;hop is perpetual chancellor of the univer&s;ity of Ingol&s;tadt, and lord of &s;everal fiefs po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by princes and counts. The mo&s;t con&s;iderable places in the bi&s;hopric are,</P>

Here, be&s;ides an epi&s;copal palace, and cathedral dedicated to our Lady, are &s;everal cloi&s;ters and churches, with a Je&s;uits college. A pious, but very lucrative fraud, is practi&s;ed by the monks of this place. In St. Walburg's church is a rock, or altar, as it is &s;tiled, containing the brea&s;t|bones of the &s;aint, from which, what they call an oil, but which, in reality, is only a vapour, for it neither burns, nor &s;wims upon the &s;urface of water, is &s;aid to flow, and force it&s;elf thro' the &s;tone twice a-year. This holy oil is put up in &s;mall vials for the u&s;e of pilgrims, and other devotees, who are a&s;&s;ured of its miraculous virtues, and for that rea|&s;on re&s;ort hither in great numbers to purcha&s;e &s;ome of it, and pay their devotions to the bones

A new co&s;tly altar was erected in this church in 1745, in honour of St. Willibald, who&s;e bones, it was pre|tended, were then found. Near the town &s;tands the &s;trong citadel of St. Willibald&s;burg, upon a hill called Will bald&s;burg, where the bi&s;hops u&s;ed for|merly to re&s;ide, and in which are kept the archives, with an ar&s;enal and library.

<HEAD>The PRINCIPALITY of ANSPACH, ANSBACH, or ONOLZBACH.</HEAD>
<P>This principality lies all below the Gebirg, and has the domain of the Teutonic order, and the bi&s;hopric of Wurzburg on the we&s;t; part of the bi&s;hopric of Bamberg on the north and ea&s;t; and the circle of Swabia on the &s;outh: but is &s;o inter|mixed with other dominions, that it is difficult to give its true dimen&s;ions. As to the &s;oil and pro|duce it excels that of Bayreuth, yielding not only &s;everal &s;orts of grain and fruits, but al&s;o wine and tobacco, iron-mines, marble, medicinal &s;prings, and woods. Tho' &s;ome parts of it are &s;andy and mountainous, yet the&s;e produce good pa&s;ture, in

which abundance of cattle are both bred and fed. The woods are well &s;tored with game, and the rivers with fi&s;h. The chief of the latter are the Rednitz, the Altmuhl, the Jaxt, the Wornetz, and the Tauber. This principality, exclu&s;ive of that of Bayreuth, is &s;aid to bring in five hundred thou&s;and crowns a-year to its &s;overeign, one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable princes of Ger|many next to the electors, having lately &s;uc|ceeded to the margravate of Bayreuth. The pre|dominant religion is Lutherani&s;m; but at Schwa|bach the Calvini&s;ts have the free exerci&s;e of theirs. At An&s;bach is a gymna&s;ium illu&s;tre. The princi|pal manufactures of the country are tape&s;try, &s;tock|ings, cloth, &s;tuffs, gold and &s;ilver lace, wire, nee|dles, porcelain, leather, and mirrors. The reign|ing margrave has a &s;eat and voice in the college of princes, and at the diets of the empire and circle. His a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the empire for this principality is three hundred and twenty-nine florins, monthly; and to the chamber-court, three hundred and thirty-eight rix-dollars, each term. His military e&s;tabli&s;hment is a life-guard of hor&s;e, and one re|giment of foot of &s;even companies. The princi|pal places in the principality are,</P>

<HEAD>Of the TEUTONIC ORDER in GENE|RAL, but in particular of the MASTERSHIP of MERGENTHEIM, and the bailiwic of FRANCO|NIA.</HEAD>
<P>This order was founded in the year 1190 in Pa|le&s;tine, and the knights were at fir&s;t called knights of the Virgin Mary, or brothers of the Teutonic hou&s;e of our Lady of Jeru&s;alem. They mu&s;t be all Germans, and of true antient nobility. They are to bind them&s;elves by vows to defend the Chri&s;|tian religion, and the Holy-land, and to protect and a&s;&s;i&s;t the poor and the &s;ick. In 1226 and 1228, after they had been obliged to quit Pale&s;tine, they obtained a grant of all the lands they &s;hould con|quer from the pagan Pru&s;&s;ians; whereupon they &s;ubdued all Pru&s;&s;ia, Courland, Semigallia, and Livonia, but afterwards lo&s;t them all again. The &s;uperior of this &s;piritual order is &s;tiled the grand and Teutonic ma&s;ter, admini&s;trator of the grand ma&s;terdom in Pru&s;&s;ia, ma&s;ter of the Teutonic order in Germany and Italy, and lord of Freu|denthal and Eulenberg. He is a prince of the empire, and, as &s;uch, has a &s;eat and vote in the diets of the empire, and of this circle, paying a matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment of one hundred and twenty-four florins, monthly; and to the chamber of Wetzlar, two hundred and thirteen rix-dollars, each term. Both Roman catholics and prote&s;tants may be inve&s;ted with the order, and the prote&s;tant knights are permitted to marry. The e&s;tates, which they are po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in
<PB N="124" REF="1240">
Germany were obtained partly by purcha&s;e, and partly by donation, and con&s;i&s;t of what is properly called the ma&s;terdom of Mergentheim, and twelve bailiwics. The grand-ma&s;ter is cho&s;en by the chap|ter, con&s;i&s;ting of the coun&s;ellors and commanders, or commenders, the latter of whom are admini&s;tra|tors and judges of the bailiwics and commenderies; but in weighty matters, an appeal lies from them to the grand-ma&s;ter. The coun&s;ellors al&s;o, and the commenders, are cho&s;en by the chapter, the latter out of the former, and confirmed by the grand|ma&s;ter. Each of the bailiwics is &s;ubdivided into commanderies. In what is called the ma&s;terdom, and the greate&s;t part of the bailiwic of Franconia, the grand-ma&s;ter acts as a &s;overeign prince; but the commanders of all the other bailiwics, except|ing tho&s;e of Al&s;ace and Coblenz, who are imme|diate &s;tates of the empire, are treated as &s;ubjects of tho&s;e princes and &s;tates in who&s;e dominions they re&s;ide. Be&s;ides the ma&s;terdom of Mergentheim, the following bailiwics belong to the order.</P>
<P>That of Franconia, containing nineteen com|mandries, lying in the circles of Swabia, Bavaria, Upper and Lower Rhine, Sile&s;ia, and Moravia.</P>
<P>That of Al&s;ace and Burgundy, containing fifteen commanderies, lying in the circle of Swabia, Swi&s;|&s;erland, the Sandgau, and Upper and Lower Al|&s;ace.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Au&s;tria, containing eight com|manderies, lying in Au&s;tria, Stiria, Carinthia, and Carniola.</P>
<P>The bailiwic &s;eated on the Et&s;ch and Gebirg in Tyrol, containing five commanderies.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Coblenz, containing &s;even com|manderies, lying, mo&s;t of them, in the electorate of Triers and Cologn.</P>
<P>The bailiwic of Old Bie&s;en, containing thirteen

<P>The bailiwic of Utrecht, of which we can give no athentic account.</P>
<P>In the ma&s;terdom of Mergentheim, and the com|manderies lying in this circle, the only places worth mentioning are,</P>
<P>Mergentheim, a &s;mall town on the Tauber, which gives name to the ma&s;terdom, and near which, in the ca&s;tle of Neuhaus, the grand and Teutonic ma&s;ter re&s;ides. It is al&s;o the &s;eat of the regency, and a gymna&s;ium.</P>

The chief river by which it is watered is the Werra, into which &s;everal &s;maller &s;treams fall. The inhabitants are all Lutherans, except at Schmal|kalden, where the Calvini&s;ts have a church. The only manufactures of the county worth mention|ing are tho&s;e of arms, hard-ware, and fu&s;tians. The pre&s;ent proprietors of it are the elector of Saxony, the duke of Saxe-Weimar, Meinungen, Gotha, Cobourg-Saalfeld, Hilburghau&s;en, and the landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el. Some of the&s;e princes are entitled by it to voices in the diets of the empire and circle, and all of them contribute to the payment of its a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment to the empire and chamber-court. The principal places in the coun|ty are,</P>
<P>Schleu&s;ingen, lying on the little river Schleuz, and belonging, with its bailiwic, and &s;everal others, to the elector of Saxony. Here is a ca&s;tle, in which the princes of Henneberg u&s;ed &s;ometimes to re&s;ide.

<P>This county lies between the marqui&s;ate of An|&s;pach and the territory of Swabian-Halle, being upwards of twenty miles in length, and near as much in breadth, and taking its name from the antient family &s;eat of Hohenlohe, which &s;tood not far from the town of Uffenheim, in the principa|lity of An&s;pach. The county, in general, is hilly, but has &s;ome fertile plains and vallies, with woods and vineyards, medicinal &s;prings, and plenty of game and cattle. At Wei&s;zbach is al&s;o a &s;alt-work. The rivers Kocher, Jaxt, Tauber, and Wernitz, by which it is watered, abound with fi&s;h, as well as the lakes, ponds, and brooks.

The hou&s;e of Hohenlohe is divided into the two capital branches of Neuen&s;tein and Waldenburg; and the&s;e again into others, who have all a &s;hare of the county, with their re&s;pective colleges and officers. Tho&s;e of the Neuen&s;tein line are counts, but tho&s;e of the Waldenburg, princes, or princely counts; for both belong to the Franconian college of counts in the diets of the empire and circle.

<HEAD>The IMPERIAL CITY of NUREMBERG.</HEAD>
<P>This city &s;tands on the Regnitz, over which it has &s;everal bridges, both of wood and &s;tone, at the bottom of a hill, &s;ixty miles from Aug&s;burg, eighty-&s;even from Munich, forty-&s;ix from Wurtz|burg, and fifty from Rati&s;bon; and is thought by &s;ome to be the Segodunum, and by others the Ca&s;trum Noricum, of the antients. It is large and well built, but not very populous. Its forti|fications are a double wall, flanked with towers mounting cannon, and a deep ditch. The magi|&s;trates, and mo&s;t of the inhabitants, are Lutherans. There are a great many churches and chapels in it. In that of St. Sebald is a bra&s;s monument of the &s;aint, and a picture, repre&s;enting the creation of the world, by the celebrated Albert Durer, who was a native of the town: but the fine&s;t church in the town is that of St. Giles. In that of the Holy Gho&s;t are kept mo&s;t of the jewels of the empire, together with the pretended &s;pear, with which our Saviour's &s;ide was pierced, a thorn of his crown, and a piece of the manger wherein he was laid. Here are al&s;o a great many ho&s;pitals, one in parti|cular for foundlings, and another for pilgrims, with a gymna&s;ium, an anatomical theatre, a gra|nary, a fine public library, the old imperial fortre&s;s or ca&s;tle, &s;ome remains of the old citadel of the

burgraves of Nuremberg, &s;everal Latin &s;chools, an academy of painting, a well furni&s;hed ar&s;enal, a Teutonic hou&s;e, in which the Roman catholic &s;ervice is tolerated, and a mint. Mr. Key&s;ler &s;ays, there are upwards of five hundred &s;treets in it, about an hundred and forty fountains, &s;ixteen churches, forty-four religious hou&s;es, twelve bridges, ten market-places, and twenty-five thou|&s;and inhabitants; and that its territory, be&s;ides the capital and four other towns, contains above five hundred villages, and about an hundred and &s;ixty mills on the Regnitz. The trade of this city, though upon the decline, is &s;till very great, many of its manufactures being &s;till exported to all parts of the world; among which may be reckoned a great variety of curious toys, in ivory, wood, and metal. This city has al&s;o di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf in the arts of painting and engraving; in particular, very fine globes and maps have been, and &s;till are, exe|cuted here. When the emperor Henry VI, a&s;&s;i&s;t|ed at a tournament in Nuremberg, he rai&s;ed thirty|eight burghers to the degree of nobility, the de|&s;cendants of whom are called patricians, and have the government of the city almo&s;t entirely in their hands, the whole council, except the eight ma&s;ters of companies, who are &s;ummoned only on extra|ordinary occa&s;ions, con&s;i&s;ting of them. On Ea&s;ter|day the council-hou&s;e, in which are a great many fine pictures, particularly an Adam and Eve, as large as the life, by Albert Durer, and other curio&s;ities, is open, together with the ca&s;tle, to be viewed by every one who has a mind to it. In the town library, among other rare and curious books and manu&s;cripts, is Luther's Bible, &s;aid to have been &s;natched from amid&s;t the flames of a fire, without receiving any damage. Here is al&s;o a Mexican idol of gold, called Fizlipuzli, having a face like that of a cat or monkey, and a tail like

that of the former, with a pearl in each ear, and a mirror on its back, in which all its votaries were to look. Among the fine bra&s;s cannon in the ar|&s;enal, is one that is charged at the breech, and may be fired eight times in a minute; and two that carry balls of eighty pounds. The city keeps, in con&s;tant pay, &s;even companies, con&s;i&s;ting each, in time of peace, of a hundred men, but, in time of war, of a hundred and eighty-five; two troops of cuira&s;&s;iers, each con&s;i&s;ting of eighty-five men, and two companies of invalids. There are al&s;o twenty|four companies of burghers, well armed and di&s;|ciplined. On the new bridge, which is &s;aid to have co&s;t a hundred thou&s;and guilders, are two pyra|mids, on the top of one of which is a dove, with an olive branch in her bill, and on the other an imperial black eagle. The town cellar is &s;o large, that a coach and &s;ix may turn round in it. At the academy of painting, men are often hired to &s;tand naked, that the painters and &s;tatuaries may draw and model by them from the life. The com|mon people here have a cu&s;tom of decking the graves of their relations, with garlands of flowers, on St. John's day. There are a great many curious collections of rarities in this city. In one of the&s;e, belonging to a private family, is kept &s;ome unde|cayed rye and wheat, that was laid up in the city granary in the year 1347, and, in another, is a bowl cut out of a rhinoceros's horn. In Leather-&s;treet is the intire petrefied trunk of a tree, &s;tanding, with its roots, in the earth. Mu&s;ic al&s;o flouri&s;hes greatly in Nuremberg; and tho&s;e who delight in mecha|nic arts and manufactures, cannot any where bet|ter gratify their curio&s;ity. As an imperial city, it has a &s;eat and voice at the diets of the empire, and circle, paying to a Roman month one &s;eventh part of the common impo&s;ts of the circle, and to the chamber of Wetzlar eight hundred and

The territory be|longing to the city is pretty large, containing, be|&s;ides two con&s;iderable fore&s;ts of pine, called the Sibald and Laurence fore&s;ts, &s;everal towns and vil|lages. Of the former that of Altorf alone is worth mentioning. In it is a citadel, con&s;i&s;ting of twelve large courts, and an univer&s;ity, to which belongs an anatomical theatre, a chymical labora|tory, a botanical garden, an ob&s;ervatory, and a valuable library.

<HEAD>CIRCLE of SWABIA.</HEAD>
<P>SWABIA is bounded on the north by the Pa|latinate and Franconia; on the &s;outh by Ty|rol and Swi&s;&s;erland; on the we&s;t by Al&s;ace; and on the ea&s;t by Bavaria. From the two la&s;t coun|tries it is &s;eparated by the Rhine and Lech, and from Swi&s;&s;erland, by the lake called the Boden&s;ee, or lake of Con&s;tance and Bregenz, which is about forty miles in length. That end of the lake which lies towards Swabia, being parted into two branches by a long &s;lip of land, one of them, viz. that next Ger|many, is called the Upper-Lake, or the Bodmer, or Ueberlinger-&s;ee, and, in Latin, Lacus Acronius; and the other, or that next Swi&s;&s;erland, the Under or Zeller-&s;ee, in Latin, Lacus Venetus, or Inferior. In the former is the i&s;land of Meinau, and in the other that of Reichenau. In Swabia are two ridges of high mountains, called the Alb or Alp, and the Schwarzwald, or Black Fore&s;t. They tra|ver&s;e the greate&s;t part of the circle, from &s;outh to north, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and mo&s;t of the rivers, which, after watering the country, fall into the Rhine or Danube, i&s;&s;ue from them. A great part of both is covered with woods, which, on the former, con&s;i&s;t mo&s;tly of beech, and on the latter of fir. The inhabitants of both &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by the breeding and &s;ale of &s;heep and cattle, wood and pitch. Swabia is di&s;tingui&s;hed into Upper and Lower, Au&s;trian and Imperial, deriving its name from the Suevi, the antient inhabitants of the country, who are &s;aid to have had their own from the cu&s;tom of plaiting their long hair, like a train, in German Schwei&s;s; a cu&s;tom, as we are told, &s;till ob|&s;erved by the modern Swabians, men, women,
<PB N="141" REF="1420">
and children. Under the Franks the country was governed by dukes. At la&s;t the emperor Henry IV. conferred it hereditarily on Frederic of Hohen|&s;taufen, his &s;on-in-law, in who&s;e family it continued till its extinction in 1268. After that, the &s;tewards appointed by the emperor, and their deputies, with the lords, bi&s;hops, barons, and the chief cities of the country, by grant, mortgage, or &s;ale, and other methods, by degrees, became &s;overeigns of different parts of it, as it happened in the re&s;t of the empire. The circle of Swabia, containing the great|e&s;t part of the country of that name, extends above a hundred miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about a hun|dred from &s;outh to north, and is bounded by the cir|cle of the Upper-Rhine, Franconia, Bavaria, Au|&s;tria, and Swi&s;&s;erland. The &s;ummoning princes are, the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance, and the duke of Wur|temberg; but the latter is &s;ole director. The diets are commonly held twice a year at Ulm. The &s;tates are divided into five benches, viz. that of the eccle&s;ia&s;tical princes and abbots, that of the temporal princes and abbots; that of the prelates; that of the counts and barons; and, la&s;tly, that of the free imperial cities, of all which we &s;hall treat in the order of their rank, and precedence, at the diet. As to its quotas of men and money to the taxes of the empire, they have been reduced to an equality with tho&s;e of the circles of Upper and Lower-Saxony, the Lower-Rhine, and We&s;tphalia, of which &s;ome account hath been given. The troops of the circle con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal regiments of foot and hor&s;e. As to religion it is one of the mixed, and on that account nominates two a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors of the imperial chamber, the one a Catholic and the other a Lutheran. The air is healthy, and the &s;oil, e&s;pecially in the lower parts of it, fruitful. The principal manufacture is linen cloth. Of the

<HEAD>The BISHOPRIC of CONSTANCE.</HEAD>
<P>This bi&s;hopric, or at lea&s;t &s;uch part of it as be|longs to this circle, lies in Upper Swabia, on both &s;ides of the Boden&s;ee, or lake of Con&s;tance. It derives its name from the city &s;o called, which &s;hall be de&s;cribed afterwards, and to which the &s;ee was removed from Windi&s;ch in Swi&s;&s;erland in the &s;ixth century, as is generally &s;uppo&s;ed; but tho' the cathedral is in Con&s;tance, the bi&s;hop has very little power there, and re&s;ides at Mer&s;burg on the other &s;ide the lake. The chapter con&s;i&s;ts of twenty canons and four expectants. The dioce&s;e was formerly very exten&s;ive, comprehending the greate&s;t part of Swabia and Swi&s;&s;erland; but the prote&s;tant religion now prevails in many parts of it. The bi&s;hop is a prince of the empire, and, as &s;uch, has &s;eat and vote in the diets of the empire and circle, paying for all his e&s;tates therein to a Roman month one hundred and &s;ixteen florins, and to the imperial chamber one hundred and twenty rix-dollars. He has his hereditary officers, namely, a mar&s;hal, chamberlain, cup-bearer and &s;teward; and al&s;o his high colleges. His revenue, ari&s;ing from his deme&s;nes, is &s;aid to amount only to about twenty thou&s;and florins. As bi&s;hop he is &s;ubordinate to the archbi&s;hop of Mentz. The principal places belonging to him in this circle are,</P>
<P>Mer&s;burg, or Mor&s;purg, a very pretty town on the Boden&s;ee, eight miles north-ea&s;t of Con&s;tance, and the re&s;idence of the bi&s;hop. The depth of the lake, oppo&s;ite the town, is one hundred and eight

<P>Reichenau, in Latin, Augia Dives, a Benedictine abbey, on the i&s;land of that name, in the Zeller|&s;ee. The abbot, before it was united to the bi|&s;hopric, was a prince of the empire; but the bi&s;hop is now abbot, and &s;tiles him&s;elf lord of Reichenau, though he has no &s;eat on account of it in the diets of the circle, as the abbot had. The emperor, Charles the Fat, lies buried in the convent, which is &s;aid to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of an emerald of an extraor|dinary &s;ize, being two inches thick, and weighing twenty-eight pounds three quarters, the gift of the afore&s;aid emperor, or, as others affirm, of Char|lemagne. The i&s;land is very plea&s;ant and fertile, e&s;pecially in wine.</P>
<P>Oehningen, a convent near Stein, of which the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance is prior, and of which he &s;tiles him&s;elf lord. Both this opulent abbey, and that of Reichenau, were annexed to the bi&s;hopric, to ballance the lo&s;s it had &s;uffered by the reformation.</P>

The bi&s;hop is a prince of the empire, and &s;uffragan to the archbi&s;hop of Mentz. He pays the u&s;ual a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ments to the empire, and chamber of Wetzlar, and has his hereditary offi|cers, and high colleges. The cathedral is in the city of Aug&s;burg, where the chapter, con&s;i&s;ting of forty per&s;ons, re&s;ides, but the bi&s;hop in the town of Dillengen. His revenue is &s;aid to amount to one

He is cho&s;en by the chapter, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty nobles, has his hereditary officers and high colleges, and is grand|mar&s;hal to the empre&s;s. He is al&s;o exempt from all epi&s;copal juri&s;diction, and &s;ubject only to the pope in &s;pirituals, by virtue of a grant from all Adrian I. He was lord of the imperial city and territory of Kempten, till 1525, when the inha|bitants purcha&s;ed their liberty of him. In the town, however, there is &s;till a palace, with its offices, belonging to him, be&s;ides the abbey church, and &s;ome private hou&s;es.

<HEAD>DUCHY of WURTEMBURG and TECK.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded on the north, by part of Franconia, the archbi&s;hopric of Mentz, and the palatinate of the Rhine; on the ea&s;t, by the coun|ty of Oettingen, the marqui&s;ate of Burgau, the territory of Ulm, the bi&s;hopric of Aug&s;burg, and &s;everal other petty &s;tates of Swabia; on the &s;outh by the Danube, the principalities of Hohenzollern, and Fur&s;tenberg, and the marqui&s;ate of Hohen|berg; and, on the we&s;t, by part of the palatinate of the Rhine, the marqui&s;ate of Baden, and the Black-fore&s;t. It reaches betwixt &s;ixty and &s;eventy miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and from &s;outh to north; being the mo&s;t con&s;iderable dominion in Swabia, not only in re&s;pect of extent, but of fertility and
<PB N="146" REF="1470">
populou&s;ne&s;s. One divi&s;ion of it is into the Unter, or Under-land, the Middle-land, and the Upper|land; the la&s;t of which makes a part of the mountainous tract called the Alb, and Black|fore&s;t. It is al&s;o divided into the land above and below the Steig, which is the name of a a ridge of mountains near Stuttgard. This duchy not only abounds in grain of mo&s;t &s;orts, but al&s;o in flax, hemp, and good wine, commonly called Neckar wine, and fruit, e&s;pecially pears and ap|ples; in&s;omuch that cyder and perry are the com|mon drink of the pea&s;ants, when wine happens to be dear. In this country are al&s;o mines of &s;ilver, copper, and iron, woods of fir, oak, beech, birch, and pine, &s;ome &s;alt-&s;prings, abundance of &s;heep, game, and cattle, coal, and turf, cobalt, &s;ulphur, terra &s;igillata, fine clays for porcelain, and earthen ware, &s;everal &s;orts of marble, black amber, ala|ba&s;ter, mill&s;tones, mineral &s;prings, and baths. Silk is al&s;o cultivated in it. It is well watered by the Neckar, the Enz, Nagold, Fils, and Rems. The number of the inhabitants amounts to near five hundred thou&s;and; that of the cities and towns to &s;ixty-eight; and that of the boroughs, market|towns, and villages, to about twelve thou&s;and. On important occa&s;ions, diets are called and held at Stutt|gard, con&s;i&s;ting of the Lutheran prelates and abbots, and the repre&s;entatives of the towns. The e&s;ta|bli&s;hed religion is Lutherani&s;m; and the dukes, who are now Roman catholics, have engaged not to attempt any innovations in point of religion, but to &s;uffer every thing to remain on its former footing. Before the Reformation there were about a dozen very rich convents in this country, who&s;e revenues are now chiefly applied to the mainte|nance of churches, &s;chools, and the clergy. Be|&s;ides Lutherans, here are &s;ome Calvini&s;ts, Wal|den&s;es, and Jews. The Walden&s;es are allowed the public exerci&s;e of their religion, but the others
<PB N="147" REF="1480">
only in private. The Lutheran clergy are under four general and thirty-eight &s;pecial &s;uperinten|dents. For the in&s;truction of youth, there are above fifty grammar &s;chools in the duchy, be|&s;ides a gymna&s;ium at Stuttgard, and an univer|&s;ity at Tubingen. For a &s;upply of able divines, and &s;choolma&s;ters, here are excellent regulations; for the &s;chools are not only regularly vi&s;ited and examined, but the more promi&s;ing youths are car|ried &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, at the public expence, from the &s;chools to the gymna&s;ium; from the gymna|&s;ium to the country convents or academies; and from the&s;e to the univer&s;ity of Tubingen, where they are maintained till they are provided for, either as &s;choolma&s;ters, or mini&s;ters, after having under|gone &s;evere examinations in their progre&s;s from one &s;eminary to another. Hence this country is &s;aid to have &s;uch able and exemplary divines, as are hard|ly to be found in any other prote&s;tant country. It is certain, however, that the&s;e divines di&s;covered a very &s;elfi&s;h, mercenary, uncharitable &s;pirit, or a very narrow, blind, bigotted zeal, in oppo&s;ing the reception of the French refugees, after the revo|cation of the edict of Nantz, and giving out, to their &s;hame and di&s;honour, that it was better to admit Mahometani&s;m than Calvini&s;m, tho' the latter differs in no material point from Lutherani&s;m. The principal manufactures of this country are, earthen-ware, porcelain, gla&s;s-ware, e&s;pecially mir|rours, paper, linen cloth, woollen &s;tuffs, hats, &s;tock|ings, printed cottons, and &s;ilks. At Calwe and Urach are trading companies, which are of great &s;ervice to the country, e&s;pecially that of the former. The princes of Wurtemburg had long only the title of counts. That of duke was fir&s;t conferred on Eber|hard I. in the year 1495, by the emperor Maxi|milian. The right of primogeniture&s;hip was e&s;ta|bli&s;hed in the family &s;o early as in the year 1473.
<PB N="148" REF="1490">
There is a branch of it &s;ettled in Sile&s;ia, which, from the duchy of Oels, has the title of duke of Wurtemburg Oels. The duke's title at pre&s;ent is, duke of Wurtemburg and Teck, count of Mompelgard, lord of Heydenheim and Ju&s;tingen. He is hereditary &s;tandard bearer of the empire, and grand-hunt&s;man; in allu&s;ion to the la&s;t of which the order of hunting was founded here in 1702. The en&s;ign of that order is a gold-cro&s;s, enamelled red, appended to a broad watered &s;carlet rib|bon, pa&s;&s;ing from the left-&s;houlder to the right|&s;ide. On the left brea&s;t of the coat is a &s;ilver &s;tar, embroidered, round which is the motto of the order, Amicitiae virtuti&s;&abque; faedus. Their grand fe&s;|tival is on St. Hubert's day. As a prince of the empire, the duke has &s;eat and voice in the college of princes at the diets, paying the u&s;ual a&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ments to the empire and imperial chamber. We have already ob&s;erved, that he is &s;ummoning prince and director of this circle. Cau&s;es are de|termined here in the la&s;t re&s;ort; no appeal lying from the court-judicature to the aulic-council, or any foreign tribunal. The revenues of the duchy are &s;aid to amount to two millions of guilders per annum; and the troops, in time of peace, to four thou&s;and men, including the contingent of the circle, which is eighteen hundred. The duke has a great number of hunting &s;eats. So numerous are the deer and wild boars, that Mr. Key&s;ler &s;ays above twenty thou&s;and head peri&s;hed in the win|ters of 1731 and 1732, by the &s;everity of the wea|ther; and no wonder they multiply fa&s;t, as no per|&s;on, on pain of death, dare offer to wound or kill them, unle&s;s at the duke's hunting matches; &s;o that the poor pea&s;ants, near the fore&s;ts, are obliged in &s;ummer to keep a con&s;tant look out, and to be con|tinually watching their flocks and corn-fields. A very antient cu&s;tom prevails thro' the whole duchy

<P>Stuttgart, or Stuttgardt, the capital and re&s;i|dence of the duke, delightfully &s;ituated on the Ni|&s;enbach, which, at the di&s;tance of four or five miles, falls into the Neckar. A new ducal pa|lace was begun here in 1746. Near the old pa|lace are the menagerie and &s;ummer hou&s;e, the latter of which is greatly admired for its architec|ture. This city was once the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and the church of the Holy Cro&s;s is &s;till &s;tiled the ca|thedral. Here the duke's high colleges are held. Some derive the name of the town from its being antiently a &s;tud for breeding hor&s;es; which &s;eems the more probable, as its arms are a colt. There are &s;ome natural hot baths near it, which are much frequented. The duke has a good collection of antiquities and rarities; among which is a Jupiter Dolichenus, being a repre&s;entation of that deity in armour, &s;tanding on the crupper of an ox, and the picture of a woman, who had a long beard, when &s;he was only twenty five years old. Here is a theatre for French comedies, an ar&s;enal, and a con&s;iderable &s;ilk manufacture. The town is not large, nor well built, mo&s;t of the hou&s;es being low, and of wood; and the &s;treets, tho' pretty broad and open, are dirty.</P>
<P>Cant&s;tadt, a &s;mall town on the Neckar, in and near which are &s;everal &s;alt &s;prings, and an excel|lent mineral &s;pring.

<HEAD>The MARGRAVATE of BAADEN.</HEAD>
<P>This country, which is one of the be&s;t in Ger|many, lies along the ea&s;tern banks of the Rhine.

The &s;hare of the former, as lying &s;outh of the other, is di&s;tingui&s;hed by the name of the Upper; and that of the latter
<PB N="154" REF="1550">
by the name of the Lower Margravate, or mar|qui&s;ate. The right of primogeniture&s;hip hath been long introduced into both the&s;e branches. The whole country is &s;aid to be near &s;ixty miles long, and twenty broad, and lies between the duchy of Wurtemberg and the Bri&s;gau. It is fruitful in corn, wine, hemp, flax, and wood, abounding in particular with che&s;nut-trees. There are al&s;o many quarries of marble and free-&s;tone in it, large herds of &s;wine, plenty of fi&s;h, fowl, and veni&s;on, and the baths and mineral &s;prings are &s;o common, that the chief towns of both marqui&s;ates have their names from them. Both princes exerci&s;e an ab&s;olute au|thority in their dominions, excepting &s;o far as it is limited by the laws of the empire, and lay taxes on their &s;ubjects without a&s;&s;embling any &s;tates. The Upper Margravate, or that of Baaden-Baa|den, is bounded by the Rhine, the Lower Mar|gravate, the duchy of Wurtemberg, the county of Eber&s;tein, and the Ortenau. Other e&s;tates be|longing to the margrave are the lord&s;hip of Mahl|berg, lying between the Ortenau and Bri&s;gau, the county of Eber&s;tein, a con&s;iderable part of the county of Sponheim, two manors in the lord&s;hip of Graffen&s;tein, and one in the duchy of Luxem|burg, with &s;everal baronies in Bohemia.

<HEAD>The CITY of AUGSBURG.</HEAD>
<P>This imperial city, called antiently Vindelica, and Augu&s;ta Vindelicorum, or Rhaetorum, from a colony planted here by Augu&s;tus Cae&s;ar, &s;tands near the conflux of the Lech and Wertach, on the confines of Bavaria, in a plea&s;ant fertile coun|try, about twenty-five miles from the Danube, be|ing the metropolis of Swabia, and one of the large&s;t and fine&s;t cities in Germany. It is well fortified, has four large, and &s;ix &s;mall gates, with a great many mona&s;teries, nunneries, and churches, be|&s;ides the cathedral. Of the churches, &s;ome be|long to the Roman catholics, and &s;ome to the Lu|therans; for here both religions are tolerated, and both have a &s;hare in the government. In this city, in 1518, Luther appeared before the diet, to an|&s;wer for his new doctrine; and twelve years after, he and Melancthon pre&s;ented their confe&s;&s;ion of faith to the emperor Charles V. whence the Lu|therans are &s;aid to be of the Aug&s;burg confe&s;&s;ion,
<PB N="178" REF="1790">
tho' their pre&s;ent creed differs widely from that confe&s;&s;ion. Be&s;ides the abovementioned public buildings, here is the fine&s;t town-hou&s;e in all Ger|many, a great many ho&s;pitals well endowed, a Lutheran gymna&s;ium, an academy for arts and &s;ciences, founded in the year 1755, and called the Imperial Franci&s;can academy, two well furni&s;hed armouries, a hou&s;e of correction, and a work-hou&s;e, with &s;everal beautiful fountains and re&s;ervoirs, whence the city is well &s;upplied with water, brought by aqueducts from the Lech to five towers, and from thence, by means of curious water-works, di&s;tributed through the whole city. There are &s;everal corn, &s;awing, flatting, and &s;melting|mills, on the aqueducts. The palaces of the counts of Fuggar are very magnificent. To the&s;e counts belong a great number of &s;mall hou&s;es in the &s;u|burbs, called the Fuggery, which are let at a very low rent to poor burghers, and others. The trade of the city, though &s;till con&s;iderable, is far &s;hort of what it was formerly. At pre&s;ent, exclu|&s;ive of the bank commerce, and the Tyrol wines, with which it &s;upplies almo&s;t all Germany, it con&s;i&s;ts chiefly in gold and &s;ilver-&s;miths wares, and tho&s;e of tin; and ivory, clocks, and toys. The government of the city is almo&s;t entirely in the hands of the pa|tricians. The bi&s;hop, however, has certain powers and prerogatives in it. The revenue of the city is very con&s;iderable, and its garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ts of three hundred men. In the council-hou&s;e are &s;ome very noble halls, which, with the other apartments, are adorned with fine pictures, &s;culptures, &s;tatues, gilding, &amp;c. Of the fountains, the mo&s;t beauti|ful are tho&s;e of Augu&s;tus and Hercules. Betwixt the gates of Gogging and Klenker, is a very curi|ous wicket for admitting proper per&s;ons in the night-time. In the cathedral are fourteen chapels, and the arms of all the countries po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by

Charles V. who here laid up his &s;word, &s;tandard, &s;ceptre, and crown, when he bid adieu to this world, and retired to a convent. The abovemen|tioned wicket is &s;o wonderful a contrivance, that certain engineers and architects, who were &s;ent by the magi&s;trates of Nuremberg to examine it, with a view to have &s;uch another made there, declared, that without pulling down the walls, and all the ma|ry, it was not in the power of the devil him&s;elf to find out how it was contrived, or to make one like it in a thou&s;and years. In the library belonging to the gymna&s;ium, are &s;ome curious books and manu|&s;cripts. The abbot of the Benedictine abbey of St. Ulrichand Afra in this city, has a &s;eat among the prelates of the Rhine, and pays the u&s;ual taxes to the empire. The revenue of the abbey is com|puted at above fifty thou&s;and crowns. It is &s;aid to be a privileged place for debtors and criminals for three days, but no longer, without the abbot's permi&s;&s;ion. In the convent of the Carmelites is a remarkable &s;un-dial, being a Madona, who&s;e hand holds a &s;ceptre, marking the hours, and who&s;e head is enriched with rays, &s;tars, and all the &s;igns of the zodiac. The public granaries of this city contain great quantities of corn. In one of the ar|&s;enals is an old battering ram of bra&s;s, &s;till pre|&s;erved entire. All orders and degrees of per&s;ons here are di&s;tingui&s;hed by their proper dre&s;&s;es, &s;ome of which are very odd and uncommon: prints of them all, done on pa&s;te-board, are &s;old in the town. The ho&s;pital of the Holy Gho&s;t is a very noble one, and patients of both religions are admitted into it. The inn, called the Three Kings, is &s;aid to be the mo&s;t &s;uperb in Europe. Neither Jews nor Calvi|ni&s;ts have a toleration for their wor&s;hip here. As an imperial city, Aug&s;burg has &s;eat and vote in the diets of empire and circle, paying a matricular

Its inhabitants are partly Roman catholics and partly Lutherans; but the latter are much more numerous than the former. The magi&s;tracy al&s;o is Lutheran, and the better half of the members patricians. Here is a Lutheran gymna&s;ium, a Teutonic hou&s;e, a noble foundation for the daughters of patricians, who are permitted to marry, a hand&s;ome town-hou&s;e, ar&s;e|nal, and cathedral. The la&s;t now belongs to the Lutherans, and by &s;ome is reckoned the fine&s;t in Germany. One of the windows is finely painted with all the lineal de&s;cendants of Abraham, down to Je&s;us Chri&s;t. The pipes of the great organ are &s;aid to amount to &s;ix thou&s;and in number. This town gave birth to the celebrated Frein&s;hemius, &s;o well known to, and &s;o much re&s;pected by, the learn|ed world. It is not near &s;o big as Aug&s;burg, but more populous, and has an exten&s;ive territory, con&s;i&s;ting of upwards of twenty bailiwics. The bridge over the Danube, con&s;i&s;ting of four arches of &s;tone, is &s;trongly fortified, as well as the town; but the latter is &s;o &s;ituated, that it could not &s;u&s;tain a long &s;iege. Here are manufactures of iron, linen, woollen, and cotton, &s;tuffs, and fu&s;tians, in which, and dre&s;&s;ed leather, clock-work, Rheni&s;h, Neckar, and other wines, a great trade is carried on. The garri&s;on, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;ix companies, are lodged in little hou&s;es, or barracks, like that of Aug&s;burg. The archives of all the free cities of Swabia are kept here, and from hence a boat goes weekly to

<HEAD>CIRCLE of BAVARIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS circle takes its name from the duchy of Bavaria, which is the mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of it, and is bounded by the circles of Fran|conia, Swabia, Au&s;tria, and the kingdom of Bo|hemia. Its greate&s;t length, from north to &s;outh, is about one hundred and ninety miles, and the greate&s;t breadth, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, one hundred and fifteen; but it is much indented on all &s;ides. There are twenty &s;tates in it, &s;ome eccle&s;ia&s;tic and &s;ome &s;ecular. The elector of Bavaria, and bi&s;hop of Saltzburg, are joint &s;ummoning princes, and di|rectors. The diets are u&s;ually held at Rati&s;bon, though &s;ometimes at Wa&s;&s;erburg, Land&s;hut, and Muldorf. Of the forty thou&s;and men that were to be maintained by the empire, according to a decree of the diet in 1681, the quota of this circle was eight hundred hor&s;e, and one thou&s;and four hundred and ninety-four foot; and of the three hundred thou&s;and florins granted by the diet in 1707, its proportion was eighteen thou&s;and two hundred and fifty-two. With re&s;pect to religion, it is one of the mixed. Of the a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors in the im|perial chamber, one is nominated by the directors for this circle. The elector of Bavaria is heredi|tary-commander of the circular forces. The air here is healthy, but a great part of the country being mountainous, the &s;oil is none of the mo&s;t fruitful. The principal rivers are, the Danube, the Lech, the Inn, the I&s;er, the Amber, and the Salz. The people, in general, are &s;aid to be exceeding poor, ignorant, and &s;uper&s;titious, yet not &s;o heavy and unpoli&s;hed as the Swabians.

<HEAD>The ARCHBISHOPRIC of SALTZBURG:</HEAD>
<P>This archbi&s;hopric is bounded on the ea&s;t by Stiria and the Upper Au&s;tria; on the we&s;t by the county of Tyrol; on the north by the duchy of Bavaria; and on the &s;outh by the duchy of Carin|thia, and the bi&s;hopric of Brixen. It is &s;aid to be about one hundred miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and upwards of &s;ixty from north to &s;outh. With re|&s;pect to the &s;oil, it is very mountainous, yielding however excellent pa&s;turage, and, in con&s;equence of that, abounding in cattle, and hor&s;es remarkable for their mettle and hardine&s;s. This country is particularly noted for the great quantities of &s;alt it produces, which it barters chiefly with Bavaria for corn for its Chamois goats, and its &s;trong pa&s;&s;es and ca&s;tles. Here are al&s;o con&s;iderable mines of gold, &s;ilver, copper, lead, iron, and lapis calami|naris, with quarries of marble, and a natural hot bath. The principal rivers are the Salza, the Inn, the Ens, and Muer, which, as well as the lakes, and other &s;treams, are well &s;tored with fi&s;h. The pea&s;ants here are all allowed the u&s;e of arms, and trained to military duty. There are no nobles in the country, and mo&s;t of the lands belong to the clergy. The &s;tates con&s;i&s;t of the prelates, the ci|ties, and towns. Notwith&s;tanding this country is under the power of a popi&s;h eccle&s;ia&s;tic, and the violent, arbitrary, and oppre&s;&s;ive manner, in which the prote&s;tants have always been treated, great numbers of them &s;till remained in it till the year 1732, when no le&s;s than thirty thou&s;and of them withdrew from it, di&s;per&s;ing them&s;elves in the &s;everal prote&s;tant &s;tates of Europe, and &s;ome of them were even &s;ent from Great-Britain to the
<PB N="195" REF="1960">
American colonies. Be&s;ides bra&s;s and &s;teel wares, and all &s;orts of arms and artillery, there are al&s;o manufactures of coar&s;e cloth and linen here. The archbi&s;hop has many and great preroga|tives: he is a prince of the empire, and per|petual legate of the holy &s;ee, in Germany, of which he is al&s;o primate. He has the fir&s;t voice in the diet of this circle, and next to the electors, in that of the empire, in the college of princes, in which he, and the archduke of Au&s;tria, pre&s;ide by turns. No appeal lies from him, either in civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical cau&s;es, but to the pope alone; and he is entitled to wear the habit of a cardinal. He has al&s;o the nomination to &s;everal bi&s;hoprics, and the canonicates that fall vacant in the months in which the popes, by virtue of the concordat, are allowed to nominate, are all in his gift. His &s;uffra|gans are the bi&s;hops of Frey&s;ingen, Rati&s;bon, Brixen, Gurk, Chiem&s;ee, Seckau, and Lavant; and of the&s;e, the four la&s;t are nominated, and even con|firmed by him, and not by the pope. At the diet of the empire, his envoy takes place of all the princes that are pre&s;ent, under the degree of an elector. His revenue is &s;aid to amount to near two hundred thou&s;and pounds a-year, a great part of it ari&s;ing from the &s;alt-works. He is able to rai&s;e twenty-five thou&s;and men; but keeps in con|&s;tant pay, be&s;ides his guards, only one regiment, con&s;i&s;ting of one thou&s;and men. His court is very magnificent, and he has his hereditary great offi|cers, and high colleges. The chapter con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-four canons, who mu&s;t be all noble, but are obliged only to four months re&s;idence. At his acce&s;&s;ion to the &s;ee, the archbi&s;hop mu&s;t pay one hundred thou&s;and crowns to Rome for the pall. There is an order of knighthood here, in&s;tituted in 1711, in honour of St. Rupert, who was the fir&s;t bi&s;hop of Salt&s;burg about the beginning of the
<PB N="196" REF="1970">
eighth century. The chief places in the arch|bi&s;hopric are,</P>
<P>Salzburg, which gives name to it, and takes its own from the river Salza, on which it &s;tands, and over which it has a bridge. It is the capital of the country, well fortified, and the re&s;idence of the archbi&s;hop. The ca&s;tle here is very &s;trong, and as &s;trongly garri&s;oned, and well provided with provi&s;ions and warlike &s;tores. The archbi&s;hop's palace is magnificent, and in the area before it is a fountain, e&s;teemed the large&s;t and grande&s;t in Germany. The &s;tables are very lofty, and the number of the hor&s;es u&s;ually kept by the arch|bi&s;hop, is &s;aid to be upwards of two hundred. The city, of which one part &s;tands on a &s;teep rock, is well built, but the &s;treets are narrow, and badly paved. Be&s;ides the abovementioned, there are two other &s;tately palaces belonging to the archbi&s;hop, one of which is called the Neuebau, and the other Mirabella. The latter of the&s;e has a very beau|tiful garden; and the number of trees in the orangery is &s;o great, that Mr. Key&s;ler tells us, twenty thou&s;and oranges have been ga|thered from them in one year. The river Salza runs clo&s;e by the walls of this garden. There are a great many other fine &s;tructures in the city, pub|lic and private, &s;uch as palaces, mona&s;teries, ho&s;|pitals, and churches. In the cathedral dedicated to St. Rupert, the apo&s;tle of Bavaria, and a Scot&s;|man by birth, all the altars are of marble of diffe|rent kinds, and one of the organs has above three thou&s;and two hundred pipes. The winter and &s;um|mer riding-&s;chools here are noble &s;tructures. The univer&s;ity was founded in 1620, and committed to the care of the Benedictines, Be&s;ides it, there are two colleges, in which young noblemen are educated.</P>

<P>The utmo&s;t extent of this electorate, from &s;outh to north, is reckoned forty-&s;even leagues, and from ea&s;t to we&s;t thirty-three; but the duchy extends only about one hundred miles in length, and &s;ixty in breadth; and is bounded on the north by Bohemia and the Upper-Palatinate; on the ea&s;t by Au&s;tria, the bi&s;hopric of Saltzburg, and the bi&s;hopric of Pa&s;&s;au; on the &s;outh by the bi&s;hopric of Brixen and the county of Tyrol; and on the we&s;t by the bi&s;hopric of Aug&s;burg, the marqui&s;ate of Burgau, and the duchy of Neuburg: containing one hun|dred and twenty towns, &s;ome walled, and &s;ome open, and above three million of inhabitants. It is divided into the Upper and Lower Ba|varia. The former of which lying under the Alps, is mountainous, cold, and barren, producing lit|tle corn, and no wine; but abounding in woods, great and &s;mall lakes, cattle, wild fowl, and game, Be&s;ides medicinal &s;prings and baths, &s;alt|works, mines of copper, &s;ilver, lead, and iron.
<PB N="198" REF="1990">
The Lower-Bavaria lying on the Danube, is much more level and fruitful, yielding grain, fruit, and pa&s;turage. The principal rivers that water the duchy, are the Danube, the Inn, the I&s;er, the Lech, the Atmuhl, the Nab, and the Regen; all which, and the lakes, abound with fi&s;h. The &s;tates of the duchy con&s;i&s;t of the prelates, the knights and nobility; the la&s;t including not only the counts and barons, but al&s;o the burghers. A committee of the &s;tates a&s;&s;emble at Munich, as often as the circum&s;tances of affairs requires it. The only religion tolerated here is the Roman ca|tholics. The clergy, both &s;ecular and regular, are very rich, and the convents very numerous; but the pea&s;ants wretchedly poor, their chief &s;ub|&s;i&s;tance ari&s;ing from the herds of &s;wine, fed in the woods and fore&s;ts. The principal manufactures of the country are coar&s;e woollen cloth, velvet, tape&s;try, &s;tockings, woollen and &s;ilk &s;tuffs, clocks and watches. The name of Bavaria is a corruption of Boiaria, and that is derived from the Boii, a warlike peo|ple, that came from Gaul, and &s;ettled here about the time of the emperor Augu&s;tus. The country was long governed by dukes, both before Charle|magne, and after. Upon duke Henry the Lion being put under the ban, in 1180, by the emperor Fre|deric I. the duchy was given to the pfalzgrave of Wittel&s;bach, de&s;cended from duke Arnulph, na|tural &s;on to Karlman, great-grand-&s;on to Charles the Great. In 1623, duke Maximilian obtained the electoral dignity, together with the Upper-Pa|latinate, from the emperor Ferdinand II. as a re|compence for the &s;ervice he did him in the war again&s;t Frederic V. elector Palatine, and king of Bohemia, who was of the &s;ame family with the duke. The pre&s;ent elector is Maximilian-Jo&s;eph, &s;on of Charles-Albert, who was cho&s;en emperor
<PB N="199" REF="2000">
in 1742. The title of the elector is, By the grace of God, duke of Upper and Lower-Bavaria, as al&s;o of the Upper-Palatinate; pfalzgrave of the Rhine, arch-&s;teward of the Holy Roman empire, elector and landgraver of Leuchtenberg. He has five he|reditary officers, viz. a ma&s;ter of the hou&s;hold, a &s;teward, mar&s;hal, cupbearer, and hunt&s;man. In 1729, the order of St. George was revived by the elector Albert, the en&s;ign of which is a cro&s;s en|amelled blue, and worn pendant to a broad &s;ky|blue ribbon, with a black and white border. The elector has the fifth &s;eat in the electoral college, and &s;everal votes at the diets both of the empire and circle, in the colleges of the princes and counts. For the duchy of Bavaria, his matricular a&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment is that of an elector, viz. &s;ixty hor&s;e and two hun|dred and &s;eventy-&s;even foot, or one thou&s;and eight hundred and twenty-eight florins, monthly, in lieu of them: and to the chamber of Wetzlar, eight hundred and eleven rix-dollars. His ordinary re|venues, ari&s;ing chiefly from the monopoly of corn, &s;alt, beer, and tobacco, tolls, mines, and contri|butions, amount to between &s;ix and &s;even hundred thou&s;and pounds per annum. With re&s;pect to his military e&s;tabli&s;hment, he maintains, in time of peace, about twelve thou&s;and regulars, exclu&s;ive of ten thou&s;and militia, the expence of which, it is &s;aid, does not amount to quite nine hundred thou&s;and imperial guilders. His court, for magnificence and &s;plendor, is exceeded by none in Germany. During an interregnum, he is vicar of the empire, alter|nately with the elector Palatine, in all places be|longing to the vicariate of the count Palatine of the Rhine.

The number of the inhabitants is &s;aid to be about forty thou&s;and. Having been built at fir&s;t on a &s;pot of ground belonging to a convent, it had from thence, in German, the name of Munchen, i. e. Monk's-town, and a monk for its arms. The elector's palace here is a very grand &s;tructure, con&s;i&s;ting of &s;everal courts, furni&s;hed and adorned in the mo&s;t magnificent manner, with tape&s;try, gilding, &s;culpture, &s;tatues, and paintings.

The great hall is one hun|dred and eighteen feet long, and fifty-two broad; and the &s;tair-ca&s;e leading to it, from top to bottom, of marble and gold. In the hall of antiquities are three hundred and fifty-four bu&s;ts and &s;tatues of ja&s;per, and porphyry, bra&s;s and marble. In this palace al&s;o is a library, containing a va&s;t collection of books, and many valuable manu&s;cripts, in mo&s;t languages, antient and modern, and a cham|ber of rarities, among which is the picture of a bravo, or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in, who is &s;aid to have committed three hundred and forty-five murders with his own hand, and to have been an accomplice in, or privy to, four hundred more. The trea&s;ury in the cha|pel contains al&s;o a va&s;t number of pictures, pre|cious &s;tones, medals, ve&s;&s;els of gold and &s;ilver, &amp;c.

<PB N="215" REF="2160">
Upper and Lower-Au&s;tria, the former lying to|wards the we&s;t, and the latter towards the ea&s;t; and is bounded by Hungary on the ea&s;t, Bavaria on the we&s;t, Bohemia on the north, and Stiria on the &s;outh. It &s;tretches, on both &s;ides the Danube, between &s;ixty and &s;eventy miles, from north to &s;outh. Except towards Stiria, the Lower-Au&s;tria is level and fertile, producing not only corn and pa&s;ture, but &s;affron, wine, wood, alum, &s;ilver ore, and procelain earth; but the air would be unwhol|&s;ome, if it was not often purified by &s;trong gales of wind. The mountain in it, called the Kahle Berg, antiently Mons Cetius, extends from near Vienna into Carniola. At Baaden are hot baths. The rivers by which it is watered are, the Da|nube, Moravia, Leitha, Tra&s;en, Erlebach, Ips, and Kamp, all abounding with fi&s;h. Upper-Au&s;tria is mountainous and barren towards Sti|ria; but the re&s;t is more level and fertile, yield|ing plenty of fruits, game, wood, &s;alt, iron, medi|cinal baths, and &s;ome petrifying &s;prings, but no wine. Its rivers, be&s;ides the Danube, are the Ens, Steyer, Traun, which, as well as the lakes, abound with fi&s;h. Both Upper and Lower-Au&s;tria are po|pulous, and full of towns, villages, &s;eats, ca&s;tles, and cloi&s;ters. In &s;ome places, the dre&s;s of the inhabi|tants is odd enough; in particular, that of the wo|men on the other &s;ide of the Traun, and in the vale of Stoder. The dialect of Au&s;tria differs widely from the High-Dutch, and extends from the Adri|atic to Swi&s;&s;erland. The diets here con&s;i&s;t of the bi&s;hops, abbots, provo&s;ts, princes, counts, barons, knights, and towns; and in them they treat of the contributions, taxes, military affairs, &amp;c. That of Lower-Au&s;tria is held at Vienna, and that of the Upper at Lintz. The nobility, who are very nu|merous, and have great privileges, as well as the other &s;tates, are divided into the higher, con&s;i&s;ting of the counts and barons, and the lower, compre

hending the knights. The margraves of Branden|burg, as well as the archbi&s;hop of Salt&s;burg, have &s;ome fiefs in Au&s;tria. The prote&s;tant religion, af|ter the reformation, made a gret progre&s;s in this country; but by degrees was pre&s;cribed, and &s;up|pre&s;&s;ed. However, there are &s;till many &s;ecret ad|herents to Lutherani&s;m; and, in the year 1751, the empre&s;s-queen promi&s;ed to protect them, while they behaved them&s;elves peaceably. The archbi|&s;hop of Vienna is a prince of the Holy Roman empire, and has the honour of the pallium and cro&s;s. With re&s;pect to the character of the Au|&s;trians, they are &s;aid to be more &s;ocial and polite than their neighbours, and very ho&s;pitable to &s;trangers; but proud and haughty, vain and con|ceited, e&s;pecially the younger &s;ort, and tho&s;e who have places about court. According to baron Pol|nitz, they are exceeding fond of titles, and the greate&s;t epicures in the world. The luxury of the inhabitants of Vienna, in particular, is &s;aid to ex|ceed that of any other place in the world. At the tables of the great are &s;eldom le&s;s than nine or ten different &s;orts of wine; and Polnitz &s;ays, that he has &s;ometimes &s;een eighteen. The women are rather hand&s;ome than beautiful, and naturally vain and re&s;erved; but free from coquetry, and more fond of finery and grandeur, than gallantry: ex|tremely ignorant, &s;uper&s;titious, and credulous; but generous and &s;incere. They u&s;e neither paint nor patches. For the education of youth, and the im|provement of the arts and &s;ciences, be&s;ides Latin &s;chools and gymna&s;ia, there is the univer&s;ity of Vienna, which is now on a better footing than former|ly, and the There&s;ian college, with &s;everal riding, military, and other academies, as of painting, &s;culp|ture, and architecture. The imperial library is one of the mo&s;t famous in the whole world. As for ma|nufactures, the principal are &s;ilks, gold and &s;ilver
<PB N="217" REF="2180">
lace, cloths, &s;tuffs, &s;tockings, linen, mirrors, porce|lain, plate, bra&s;s, and other hard wares. The commodities exported are chiefly &s;affron, wine, alum, and gunpowder. At the &s;ame time, the importation of foreign manufactures is either whol|ly prohibited, or loaded with heavy duties. An exchange and loan-bank were elected at Vienna in 1704, where is al&s;o a court of commerce. Ro|dolph I. count of Hab&s;burg, who flouri&s;hed to|wards the end of the thirteenth century, was the founder of the pre&s;ent Au&s;trian family, which, from that time, gained continual acce&s;&s;ions of power, dignity, and dominion; till, at la&s;t, in the per&s;on of Albert II. it arrived at the im|perial throne, which it hath po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, almo&s;t without interruption, ever &s;ince, for upwards of three hundred years. Among the high privileges of this illu&s;trious hou&s;e are the&s;e: The arch|dukes may appear or not, as they plea&s;e, at the diets of the empire; yet nothing can be concluded there without their participation. They are not &s;ubjected to any taxes of the empire, and yet may claim its protection. They are exempted from the juri&s;diction of all the judicatories, and the ban of the empire; receive the inve&s;titure gratis, and in their own territories can create barons, counts, and princes, in any part of the empire; and when the male &s;tock of the family becomes extinct, the hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is to de&s;cend to the elde&s;t daughter. As to the hereditary officers, the counts of We&s;&s;enwolf are hereditary &s;tewards in the Upper, and the princes of Traut&s;on in the Lower Au&s;tria: the princes of Lamberg here|ditary chamberlains in the Upper, and the counts of Breuner in the Lower: the latter al&s;o, as heredi|tary play-counts, or ma&s;ters of the revels, have juri&s;diction over all jugglers and min&s;trels. The counts of Stahrenberg are hereditary mar&s;hals; the counts of Harrach hereditary ma&s;ters of the
<PB N="218" REF="2190">
hor&s;e; the counts of Hardeg hereditary cupbearers in the Lower, and the counts of Zinzendorf in the Upper Au&s;tria. The latter are al&s;o hereditary carvers, combat-judges, and combat-&s;hield-bearers, both in Upper and Lower Au&s;tria, and heredi|tary rangers in the Lower, but the princes of Lamberg in the Upper. The counts of Kuf|&s;tein are hereditary ma&s;ters of the jewel office; the barons of Hegenmuller hereditary purveyors; the lords of Rappach hereditary Stabelmei&s;ters, or di&s;po&s;ers of the &s;taffs, both in Upper and Lower Au&s;tria; the counts of Theirheim, hereditary fal|coners in Upper, and the counts of St. Julian in Lower Au&s;tria; the counts of Sprinzen&s;tein he|reditary mint-ma&s;ters; the counts of St. Hilario hereditary artillery-ma&s;ters; the counts of Paar hereditary po&s;t-ma&s;ters; the counts of Alben&s;|berg and Traun hereditary bannerets in both Au&s;trias; the provo&s;ts of St. Polten hereditary chaplains in Lower, and the abbots of Steyerger|&s;tein in Upper Au&s;tria. The&s;e offices, to which con|&s;iderable advantages are annexed, though hereditary in the abovementioned families, cannot be held by them unle&s;s they are members of the Catholic church. The order of the knights of the Golden-fleece being common to Au&s;tria and Spain, we &s;hall give an ac|count of it, when we come to treat of the la&s;t of the&s;e countries. Here are al&s;o two orders of la|dies, who are a &s;ort of knights, both founded by the empre&s;s-dowager Eleonora, in 1662. The one con&s;i&s;ts of thirty ladies, part prote&s;tants, part pa|pi&s;ts, and is called the order of the Slaves of Virtue. The other is that of the United Cro&s;s-bearers, who are &s;eventeen in number, and all papi&s;ts. The badge of the former is a gold medal, repre&s;enting the &s;un, encompa&s;&s;ed with a laurel crown, and their motto, <HI>Sola ubique triumphat.</HI> The latter wear on their left-&s;ide a four-cornered cro&s;s, fa&s;tened to

<P>For the government of Upper and Lower-Au&s;tria there are &s;everal colleges, &s;ubordinate to one ano|ther, the chief of which are held at Vienna. The civil law is of force in Au&s;tria, where it is not re|pugnant to the archduke's ordinances, or tho&s;e made, with their con&s;ent, by the land-diets. The revenues of the &s;overeign ari&s;e partly from the &s;ub|&s;idies granted by the &s;tates, and partly from the crown-lands, tolls, duties, exci&s;e, &amp;c. By virtue of a conce&s;&s;ion of pope Nicholas V. the archdukes may impo&s;e taxes on eccle&s;ia&s;tics. The forces of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria amounted, in the year 1755, to an hundred and eight regiments of infantry, cuira&s;&s;iers, dragoons, and hu&s;&s;ars, be&s;ides twelve independent companies, and fourteen thou&s;and invalids. Of the &s;ixteen million three hundred and eighty-&s;even thou&s;and eight hundred and &s;ixty-three florins, levied on the whole Au&s;trian hereditary countries, (the Netherlands and Italian &s;tates excepted) for the maintenance of this army, Lower-Au&s;tria pays two million eight thou&s;and nine hundred and &s;ixty-eight florins, and Upper-Au&s;tria nine hundred and &s;ix thou&s;and two hun|dred and twenty-eight.

<P>Lower-Au&s;tria, in 1753, was divided into four circles, two of which lie on the &s;outh, and two on the north, of the Danube. Tho&s;e on the &s;outh &s;ide are called the circles, below and above the fo|re&s;t of Vienna; and tho&s;e on the north, the circles below and above Manhart&s;berg, a mountain &s;o named. The chief places in the fir&s;t of the&s;e cir|cles are,</P>
<P><PB N="220" REF="2210">
Vienna, the capital of the whole archduchy, &s;tands on the &s;outh &s;ide of the Danube, forty miles we&s;t of Pre&s;burg, forty ea&s;t of Lintz, one hundred north-we&s;t of Buda, one hundred and eighty &s;outh-we&s;t of Cracow, four hundred and fifty north of Rome, five hundred and &s;ixty ea&s;t of Rotterdam, five hundred from Paris, &s;ix hundred from London, and five hundred and &s;eventy we&s;t of Con&s;tantinople. The Turks call it Beez, the natives Wien, and the Poles Wieden. The an|tient Vindobena &s;tood in the neighbourhood. The Danube is here very wide, forming &s;everal beau|tiful i&s;lands, well &s;tocked with wood. The coun|try to the ea&s;t and north is level; but to the we&s;t and &s;outh there is a range of mountains, cloathed with trees and vines. It &s;eems to have been a con|&s;iderable place in the time of the Romans, for it was the &s;tation of their Cla&s;&s;is I&s;trica, or navy on the Danube; and here the emperor Marcus Au|relius Antoninus Philo&s;ophus is &s;aid to have died. In 1192 it was enlarged, beautified, and walled round with the ran&s;om-money which the mar|quis of Au&s;tria obliged Richard I. of England to pay when he made him pri&s;oner in his return from the Holy Land, becau&s;e he took down the Au&s;trian banner at Joppa, and threw it into the hou&s;e of office. This ran&s;om was one hundred and forty thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver, Cologne weight; &s;o prodigious a &s;um for tho&s;e times, that the Eng|li&s;h were obliged to &s;ell their church-plate to rai&s;e it. The city it&s;elf is of no great extent, contain|ing, be&s;ides churches and cloi&s;ters, which have generally exten&s;ive gardens and walks, about twelve hundred hou&s;es, from four to &s;even &s;tories high, eighty &s;treets, and fifteen principal &s;quares. There are many magnificent palaces in it, and in the burghers hou&s;es the &s;econd &s;tory is allotted for the re&s;idence of the imperial court officers. It is well

fortified after the modern way, and, including the &s;uburbs, may be about a quarter as big as London and We&s;tmin&s;ter. It is very populous, having al|ways great numbers of &s;trangers in it, of mo&s;t Eu|ropean nations, in their proper habits, and may con|tain generally about one hundred and eighty thou|&s;and &s;ouls. The &s;treets are narrow and dirty, and the air would be very unwhole&s;ome, were it not for the high wind, which blow here mo&s;t part of the year: whence the proverb, Vienna vel vento&s;a, vel veneno&s;a. In mo&s;t of the &s;quares are beautiful fountains and magnificent monuments, erected by the emperors. The metropolitan church of St. Stephen is a large magnificent Gothic building, with a tower four hundred and &s;ixty Au&s;trian feet high, and a bell upwards of ten feet in height, and thirty-two in circumference. The bowels of the archducal hou&s;e at their deaths are depo&s;ited in a vault of this church; but their hearts in the cloi&s;ter church of the bare|footed Augu&s;tines, which is the imperial abbey|church, and their bodies in that of the capuchin|cloi&s;ter. The archbi&s;hops revenue is near thirty thou&s;and imperial florins per annum. Among the cloi&s;ters, of which there are a great number here, both in the city and &s;uburbs, one of the principal is the Schotten, or Scotti&s;h Benedictine abbey, who&s;e abbot is mitred, and a &s;tate of the country, and to who&s;e juri&s;diction the populous &s;uburb of St. Ulrich, together with the Neubau, are &s;ubject. This abbey was founded for the Scots, in honour of their countryman St. Colman, who was former|ly reckoned the patron of Au&s;tria. At the entrance of the church of St. Stephen there is a &s;tone placed in the wall, and held in great veneration by the papi&s;ts, being &s;uppo&s;ed to be one of tho&s;e with which St. Stephen was &s;toned to death. It looks like a pebble, and is worn very &s;mooth, in con&s;e|quence
<PB N="222" REF="2240">
of the &s;uper&s;tition of the people, who are continually touching it out of devotion. From the &s;pire of the church is a mo&s;t noble pro&s;pect of the city and adjacent country, and of the cour&s;e of the Danube, almo&s;t to Pre&s;burgh, in Hungary. In the tower there is a ca&s;e of wooden hammers, with which they call the people to church from Good-Friday to Ea&s;ter-Sunday, becau&s;e they will not &s;uffer the bells to ring out during the time that our Saviour is &s;uppo&s;ed to have lain in the grave. Here are many ho&s;pitals, one in particular called the Burgher-&s;pital, in which near three thou&s;and per&s;ons are maintained. The imperial palace is a mean old building, con&s;i&s;ting of two courts; the inner for the imperial family, and the outer, which is the large&s;t, for lodging the courtiers and guards. The imperial cabinet of coins and medals is the large&s;t and grande&s;t in Europe; and the imperial library equals, if not exceeds, that of the Vatican, and the royal library at Paris, being &s;uppo&s;ed to contain near one hundred thou&s;and volumes. A|mong other curious manu&s;cripts is one of Livy, above a thou&s;and years old; a Greek manu&s;cript of Dio&s;corides, above one thou&s;and one hundred; a Greek manu&s;cript of the book of Gene&s;is, above one thou&s;and three hundred, containing many cu|rious draughts and repre&s;en ations in miniature, or water colours; Luther's Bible, with a great many notes in his own hand writing; a Greek manu&s;cript of the New-Te&s;tament, above one thou&s;and five hundred years old, in gold letters on purple. Here is a noble univer&s;ity, endowed with large revenues and privileges, and divided into four cla&s;&s;es, having each of them peculiar rules and im|munities, namely, the Au&s;trian cla&s;s for the &s;tu|dents of Au&s;tria, Italy, and other countries be|yond the Alps. That of the Rhine, for the we&s;tern parts of the empire, France, Spain, and the Ne|therlands.
<PB N="223" REF="2250">
That of the Hungarians, for Hungary, Bohemia, with other countries which &s;peak Sclavonic, and &s;ome parts of Germany. La&s;tly, that of the Saxons, taking in Saxony, Sweden, Denmark, the north parts of Germany, with Great-Britain and Ireland. Hence the &s;tu|dents here are of many nations. The Je&s;uits are the only profe&s;&s;ors of divinity and philo&s;ophy. The principal, or chancellor, with the other ma&s;ters of the univer&s;ity, have the power of life and death over the &s;cholars: but the e&s;tabli&s;hments for paint|ing, &s;culpture, and the other fine arts, are on a much better footing here than tho&s;e for the &s;ciences, e&s;pe|cially in re&s;pect to philo&s;ophy and divinity, which, as taught in the colleges of the Je&s;uits, are little better than a heap of &s;chola&s;tic chimeras. How|ever, in the year 1752, an imperial ordinance was i&s;&s;ued, with a view to improve the me|thod of teaching. Vienna is divided into four quarters, one of which is called the Schotten, that is, the Scotti&s;h quarter. One of the gates al&s;o is called the Scots gate, in remembrance of &s;ome notable exploit performed there by the troops of that nation. The mini&s;ters of the prote&s;tant crown|ed heads have chapels here, as in other Roman catholic countries; and &s;ome prote&s;tants held offices, both civil and military, under the late emperor Charles VI. The Jews were formerly tole|rated; but, at pre&s;ent, neither here, nor in any other part of Au&s;tria. The &s;uburbs are much larger than the city it&s;elf. To ride round the line, which enclo&s;es them at an ordinary pace, would take up about four hours. The large&s;t of them is called Leopold-&s;tadt, from the emperor Leopold. In that of Ro&s;&s;au, is the grand palace of Lich|ten&s;tein. In that of Wieden, is the new imperial favourita, or &s;ummer-palace. In that called Renn|weg, is the cloi&s;ter of the female Salerians, or
<PB N="224" REF="2260">
Engli&s;h nuns, with the grand palaces of the late prince Eugine of Savoy, and of the prince of Schwarzenberg. In that called Land&s;tra&s;ze, is a fine cloi&s;ter of hermits of the order of St. Augu&s;|tine, who wear white ermine. The garri&s;on here con&s;i&s;ts of one regiment of foot, who are lodged in ca&s;erns. The city, by means of the Danube, is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, and every thing el&s;e u&s;eful, nece&s;&s;ary, or agreeable. As it is the &s;eat of the court, and the &s;upreme colleges and tribunals, there is a prodigious re&s;ort to it, e&s;pecially of the noble&s;&s;e, from all the hereditary countries, and others, particularly tho&s;e of the empire. The grandeur of this court exceeds that of mo&s;t others. All, or mo&s;t of the officers of &s;tate, and of the hou&s;hold, of the hor&s;e and foot guards, and above one hundred gentlemen of the bed chamber, who wear golden keys at their brea&s;ts, are either princes, counts, or barons; but the etiquette, that is an|tient forms and u&s;ages, which are rigidly ob&s;erved, tho' univer&s;ally exclaimed again&s;t, give it an air of con&s;traint, that is no where el&s;e to be &s;een. Days of Gala, i. e. fe&s;tivals and holidays, are very wel|come both to the court and city. They are of three &s;orts, the court-gala, the grand-gala, and little-gala. The fir&s;t are the birth-days, name-days, &amp;c. of the emperor and empre&s;s. The &s;e|cond, tho&s;e of &s;ome mini&s;ter, which are kept in the city. And the third, when any piece of good fortune happens to a family of rank and di&s;tinction, or when any great lady is let blood, which, baron Polnitz tells us, is enough to put the whole city in gala. He ob&s;erves it as a &s;ingular cu&s;tom at this court, that the empre&s;s-dowager can never quit mourning, tho' their officers and dome&s;tics may: that their apartments mu&s;t always be hung, and their coaches covered with black: that they cannot be pre&s;ent at a play, ball, or concert: and

<P>In the neighbourhood of Vienna is the palace of Schonbrun, the fine&s;t of all the imperial palaces: al&s;o Hetzendorf, Eber&s;dorf, and Luxemburg plea|&s;ure-hou&s;es. In the village from which the &s;e|cond takes its name, the empre&s;s-queen, in 1725, founded a charity for the daughters of fifty poor officers, who are maintained gratis, and in&s;tructed in the languages and female qualifications. Near the &s;ame village is the Neu-Gibaude, where all kinds of rare animals are kept. In the Luxem|burg palace the imperial family re&s;ides, while they take the diver&s;ion of heron-hunting.

<P><PB N="228" REF="2300">
Linz, the capital of Upper-Au&s;tria, &s;tanding on the Danube, one hundred miles we&s;t of Vienna, and one hundred and ten &s;outh of Prague. Here is a wooden bridge over the Danube; and on a hill in the neighbourhood is a citadel, which is &s;ome|times the re&s;idence of the emperor. The town is well-built of white free-&s;tone, and populous, containing &s;everal hand&s;ome churches, cloi&s;ters, &s;quares, and fountains, and is much re&s;orted to by the nobility, who have plea&s;ure-hou&s;es in the neighbourhood. It is al&s;o the &s;eat of &s;everal courts and colleges for Upper-Au&s;tria; carries on a con|&s;iderable trade in gun-barrels and linen cloth; and has hand&s;ome &s;uburbs, with two great yearly fairs, at Ea&s;ter and Bartholomew-tide. In the neighbourhood, likewi&s;e, are plantations of hops.</P>
<P>Wels, a well-built town on the river Traun, &s;aid to have been founded by the emperor Vale|rian, after his expedition again&s;t the Scythians in Pannonia. Here is a ca&s;tle, in which the emperor Maximilian I. died. From this town al&s;o the neighbouring exten&s;ive barren heath of Wel&s;ar takes its name.</P>
<P>Gmunden, a town &s;ituated on the lake of Gmund or Traun, which abounds with fi&s;h. It has a con&s;iderable trade in &s;alt, made at Hal&s;tadt, in the neighbourhood, brought hither by the lake, and exported as far as Vienna. The &s;alt-pits were fir&s;t di&s;covered in 1303, by Elizabeth, con&s;ort to Albrecht I. On an i&s;land in the lake is a royal citadel, called Ort.</P>
<P>Focklabruck, or Voklabruck, a well-built town, on the river Vokl, which enjoys the privilege of granting protection to all &s;laves, and who&s;e burgh|ers and merchants, with their wares, are toll-free, throughout all the Au&s;trian dominions. Near it, in 1626, the rebel Bavarians were defeated.</P>

<P>Schaumberg, a citadel, which gives name to a county, now belonging to the family of Stahren|berg, but formerly an immediate county of the empire.</P>
<P>The county of Neuberg al&s;o was formerly an immediate county of the empire, but now belongs to the bi&s;hop of Pa&s;&s;au. Tho' this county is a part of Au&s;tria, it is &s;urrounded on all &s;ides by Bavaria, and has &s;everal citadels in it.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable places in the Traun quar|ter are,</P>
<P>Ens, in Latin Ani&s;ia, Ana&s;um, or Ana&s;&s;anum, a fair, &s;trong, and well-built town, &s;ituated on the river of the &s;ame name, fifteen miles ea&s;t of Linz, and ninety we&s;t of Vienna. It was built in the year 990 on the &s;ite of Lauriacum, a Roman co|lony, de&s;troyed by the Huns, about the year 450, and the &s;eat of &s;ome Roman emperors. Ens was formerly &s;ubject to its own count, till the emperor Rodolph purcha&s;ed it, and annexed it to the do|minions of Au&s;tria.

The hard-wares made here are conveyed by the Danube to all the neighbouring parts. The town was formerly the capital of a county, and belonged to Stiria; but the Stirian duke Ottocar, having ceded his duchy to his fa|ther-in-law, duke Leopold of Au&s;tria, it was &s;e|parated from Stiria, and annexed to the country above the Ens.</P>
<P>This quarter, be&s;ides the above towns, contains &s;everal mona&s;teries, the chief of which are the rich cloi&s;ter of Benedictines, near Krem&s;mun&s;ter, and that of St. Florian.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of STIRIA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is divided into the Upper and Un|der Stiria, or Steyermark, and bounded to the ea&s;t by Hungary, to the we&s;t by Carinthia and Salz|burg, to the &s;outh by Carniola, and to the north by Au&s;tria. The air of Stiria is &s;aid to be unwhole|&s;ome; whence the Hungarian fever, and other di&s;|tempers, are frequent here, be&s;ides that which is &s;o common among the inhabitants of the Alps, viz. a large &s;welling under the chin, to which the poorer &s;ort are mo&s;t liable, &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to drinking the &s;now-water, which comes off the mountains, and mixes with their brooks and rivers. The&s;e &s;wellings are &s;ometimes &s;o ex|traordinary, that they deprive the patients both of &s;en&s;e and voice; and the poor women, when they &s;uckle their infants, are forced &s;ometimes to lift them up, becau&s;e they hang &s;o low as to cover their nipple. In mo&s;t of their towns are ho&s;pitals for tho&s;e that are afflicted by this di&s;temper, in a more than ordinary degree. The Upper Stiria, or Steyermark, is full of high and &s;teep mountains, which, notwith&s;tanding, are generally cultivated and inhabited to the very top. The&s;e mountains are buried in &s;now all winter, and exceeding cold; but the inhabitants are habituated to the &s;everity of the weather, and wonderfully hardy. They contain &s;ilver, lead, copper, but e&s;pecially iron; and their &s;ummits are covered with fore&s;ts, which &s;upply wood for &s;melting the&s;e metals. The Sti|rian
<PB N="232" REF="2360">
&s;teel is reckoned the be&s;t in Europe. Among the&s;e mountains al&s;o are many lakes, abounding with fi&s;h, hot baths, medicinal &s;prings, and &s;alt|works They yield, moreover, a fine &s;ort of wheat, feed large herds of cattle and goats, and abound with wild fowl.</P>
<P>The Under or Lower Stiria, or Steyermark, is more champaign than the Upper, yielding corn, and a very good wine, particularly near Racke&s;|burg, Cilli and Luetenberg, with hot-baths, and medicinal &s;prings. In the quarter of Cilli, dor|mice are reckoned a great dainty, as they are in Carniola and Italy.</P>
<P>In the whole duchy are twenty boroughs, near one hundred market-towns, and about five hundred ci|tadels: the highways are &s;aid to be in very good condition. The common people generally &s;peak Wendi&s;h, or a very har&s;h dialect of the German, and the better &s;ort are ma&s;ters not only of the&s;e, but al&s;o of Italian and French. The land-&s;tates of this duchy con&s;i&s;t, as in Au&s;tria, of the prelates, lords, knights, and royal towns, and their a&s;&s;emblies are held at Gratz. The Roman catholic is the only re|ligion tolerated in Stiria. Seckau is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, &s;ubject to the archbi&s;hop of Salzburg, who&s;e vicar he is in mo&s;t part of Stiria. At Gratz is an univer&s;ity, and in &s;ome other places, gymna&s;ia and colleges of Je&s;uits. The principal manufactures of the country are iron and &s;teel works, of which there is a con&s;iderable exportation. Stiria continued a marqui&s;ate, till the emperor Frederic Barbaro&s;&s;a erected it into a duchy. It has been con&s;tantly &s;ubject to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, &s;ince Rodolph I. and to this day retains peculiar immunities. The counts of Trautman&s;dorf are &s;upreme hereditary &s;tewards; the counts of Wilden|&s;tein chamberlains; the counts of Saurau mar&s;hals; the counts of Windi&s;h Gratz, ma&s;ters of the hor&s;e;

the family of Stubenberg, cup-bearers; the counts of Hardegk, &s;ewers; the princes and counts of Dietrich&s;tein, rangers; the counts of Rothal, ma&s;ters of the jewels; the family of Wurmbrand, purveyors; the counts of Schrattenbach, carvers; and the counts of Steinpeis, falconers. Stiria is governed by a captain general, who repre&s;ents the &s;overeign, and re&s;ides at Gratz, where are al&s;o &s;everal high colleges for the whole of the inner Au&s;trian countries. Towards the maintenance of the army, it contributes 1, 182, 545 florins yearly; but, for the mo&s;t part, only two regiments of foot lie in it.</P>
<P>The principal places in lower Stiria are</P>
<P>Gratz, in Latin Graecium, the capital of the duchy, &s;ituate on the river Muehr, over which is a bridge leading to a large &s;uburb, &s;eventy-four miles &s;outh of Vienna. It is well built and forti|fied, and contains a great many churches and cloi&s;ters, together with a fort, in which the col|leges are held, a diet-hou&s;e, an ar&s;enal, a Je&s;uits college, an univer&s;ity, and an ho&s;pital. The ca&s;tle or citadel, in which is the archduke's palace, &s;tands on a high rocky-hill, commanding the town and neighbouring country. Here are two annual fairs which continue each a fortnight. In the ca&s;tle is a great horn, which is &s;ounded every morning and evening, and a va&s;t large bell, which is rung every morning at &s;even o'clock. The nobility, who re&s;ide here in great numbers, have many palaces, and the burghers are wealthy.</P>
<P>Marburgh or Marchburg, which was once the capital of an independant county, &s;tands twenty|four miles &s;outh of Gratz, and is noted for Roman monuments.</P>
<P>Pettau, commonly called Petovium, but more properly Petovio, a pretty little town &s;ituate on the river Drave, thirty miles &s;outh ea&s;t of Gratz.

<P>Luetenberg, a market town, noted for the be&s;t wine in the&s;e parts.</P>
<P>Cilli or Zilli, formerly the capital of an inde|pendent county, which the emperoror Frederic III. took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of in 1457, when the la&s;t count was killed, leaving no heirs, and incorporated with Stiria. In this county &s;tands the high mountain Bacher or Pacher, rich in all &s;orts of ores, as the mineral waters that i&s;&s;ue from it evedently &s;hew. The highway between Cilli and Pettau was ori|ginally a Roman cau&s;ey, and &s;everal Roman mile|&s;tones and other monuments have been found near it. The inhabitants of the county are all Scla|vonians, otherwi&s;e called Wends or Winds. The town, &s;tiled in Latin authors Cilia, Celia, Celeia, and Zelia, is very antient, and by many Roman coins, and other monuments di&s;covered in and about it, appears to have been antiently a place of great con&s;ideration.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of CARINTHIA.</HEAD>
<P>A part of this country was antiently called Car|nia, and the inhabitants Carni; but the former afterwards Carinthia, and the latter Carantani, and Carinthi. The country of Carinthia (what
<PB N="236" REF="2400">
goes under that name at pre&s;ent) is bound|ed to the &s;outh by the territory of the republic of Venice and Carniola, to the north by Stiria and the archbi&s;hopric of Saltzburg, to the we&s;t by Ty|rol, and to the ea&s;t by Stiria. The air of this country is cold, and the &s;oil in general mountainous and barren; but there are &s;ome fruitful dales or valleys in it, which produce wheat and other grain. The lakes, brooks, and rivers, which are very numerous, abound in fi&s;h, and the mountains yield good iron, with &s;ome lead, and in many places are covered with woods. The river Drave runs acro&s;s the country, receiving &s;everal le&s;&s;er &s;treams in its pa&s;&s;age. In this duchy are eleven boroughs, twenty-one market-towns, and an hundred and &s;eventy-five ca&s;tles. The inhabitants are partly de&s;cendants of the antient Germans, and partly of the Sclavonians or Wends. The &s;tates are con&s;tituted as in Au&s;tria, and their a&s;&s;emblies held at Clagenfurt. The archbi&s;hop of Saltzburg, and the bi&s;hop of Bamberg, have con&s;iderable territories in this country. Chri&s;tianity was planted here in the &s;eventh century. The only profe&s;&s;ion tolerated at pre&s;ent is the Roman catholic. The bi|&s;hops are tho&s;e of Gurk and Lavant, who are &s;ub|ject to the archbi&s;hop of Saltzburg. At Clagen|furt there is a gymna&s;ium for the in&s;truction of youth. This country was formerly a part of the duchy of Bavaria. In the year 1282 the emperor, Rodolph I. gave it to Maynard, count of Tyrol, on condition that, when his male i&s;&s;ue failed, it &s;hould revert to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, which hap|pened in 1331. The hereditary officers here are, the counts of Ro&s;enberg, &s;tewards; the counts of Herber&s;tein, chamberlains and &s;ewers; the counts of Khevenhuller, ma&s;ters of the hor&s;e; the counts of Dietrich&s;tein, cupbearers; the counts of Para|dei&s;er, rangers; the counts of Seilern, purveyors;
<PB N="237" REF="2410">
the counts of Thurn, jewel-keepers; the counts of Wels, &s;taff-bearers; the counts of Sturgk, carvers; and the barons of Haller&s;tein, falconers. This duchy has its particular governor or land-captain, as he is called, and towards the expences of the mi|litary e&s;tabli&s;hment contributes annually &s;ix hun|dred and thirty-&s;even thou&s;and &s;ix hundred and ninety-five florins. Only one regiment of foot is u&s;ually quartered in it.</P>
<P>The principal places in Lower-Carinthia are,</P>
<P>Clagenfurt, the capital of the whole duchy, &s;tanding an hundred and forty miles &s;outh-we&s;t of Vienna, being antiently called Claudia, and the &s;eat of the dukes. It is well built and fortified, and contains &s;everal churches and convents, with a college of Je&s;uits, a gymna&s;ium, and a provincial hou&s;e, in which the &s;tates a&s;&s;emble. Here is al&s;o an eque&s;trian &s;tatue of the emperor Theobald, and two pillars of marble, con&s;ecrated, the one to the Holy Trinity, and the other to the Virgin. Aeneas Sylvius &s;ays, that in his time, if a man was &s;trong|ly &s;u&s;pected of theft, they u&s;ed fir&s;t to hang him, and then try him, three days after. If he was found guilty, they let his body hang till it rotted; if innocent, they took him down, buried him at the public charge, and prayed for his &s;oul. Be|tween this town and St. Veit are &s;ome remains of an antient town, &s;uppo&s;ed to be Tiburnia, where Roman coins have been found, and other antiqui|ties. The Lutheran religion was &s;uppre&s;&s;ed here anno 1600.</P>

<HEAD>The DUCHY of CARNIOLA.</HEAD>
<P>This duchy is bounded to the &s;outh by the A|driatic &s;ea and that part of I&s;tria po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the republic of Venice, to the north by Carinthia and Sti ia, to the ea&s;t by Sclavonia and Croatia, and to the we&s;t by Friuli, the county of Gorz or Goritz, and a part of the gulph of Venice, extending, in length, about an hundred and ten miles, and in breadth about fifty. It is called by the Germans Krain or Crania, which, as well as its antient name Carnia, and its modern Carniola, is derived from its antient inhabitants, the Carni, a tribe of the Scythians, otherwi&s;e called Japides, whence this and the adjacent countries were al&s;o named Japi|dia. In this duchy a great many different jargons are &s;poken, the inhabitants being compo&s;ed of Ger|mans, Sclavonians, Croatians, Walachians, Ita|lians, and Dalmatians: but tho&s;e chiefly in u&s;e are, the Sclavonian or Wendi&s;h, and German; the fir&s;t by the common people, and the latter by tho&s;e of rank and fa&s;hion. Carniola is full of mountains, &s;ome of which are cultivated and in|habited, &s;ome covered with wood, others naked and barren, and others continually buried in &s;now. From the &s;ummit of the Loibel or Lobel, a very high, &s;teep, and rocky mountain, which &s;eparates Carniola from Carinthia, is a pro&s;pect of va&s;t ex|tent, and very &s;triking. The middle Krain is one
<PB N="240" REF="2440">
continued chain of mountains, in which, as well as the others, are many remarkable caverns. Not|with&s;tanding the&s;e mountains, Carniola, in general, is a fruitful country, e&s;pecially in the vallies, which yield yearly &s;everal crops; for when the wheat, rye, barley, lentils, pea&s;e, and beans are cut down, buck-wheat, and afterwards hemp, flax, and millet, are &s;own and reaped. Some parts of the country yield al&s;o apples and pears, of which cyder and perry is made; together with che&s;nuts, wal|nuts, olives, grapes, oranges, citrons, and lemons. Here is, moreover, good pa&s;ture, with herds of horned cattle and hor&s;es, all &s;orts of veni&s;on and fowl, &s;ea and river fi&s;h, metals and minerals, par|ticularly iron, &s;teel, lead, and copper; but &s;alt they mu&s;t have from the &s;overeign's magazines. There are &s;everal rivers in Carniola, of which the Sau is the chief, be&s;ides medicinal &s;prings, hot-baths, and inland lakes, of which la&s;t the Zirk|nitzer&s;ee is the mo&s;t remarkable.</P>
<P>It is &s;aid to contain twenty-one cities, thirty-five market-towns, above two hundred ca&s;tles, and about four thou&s;and villages. The common Car|niolians are a very hardy race, going barefoot in winter through the &s;now, the men always with open brea&s;ts, and &s;leeping on a hard bench, with|out bed or bol&s;ter. Their food al&s;o is very coar&s;e and mean. In winter, when the &s;now lies deep on the ground, the mountaineers bind either &s;mall ba&s;kets, or long thin narrow boards, like the Lap|landers, to their feet, on which, with the help of a &s;tout &s;taff or pole, they de&s;cend with great velocity from the mountains. When the &s;now is frozen, they make u&s;e of a &s;ort of irons, or &s;kaits. In different parts of the country, the inhabitants, e&s;pecially the common &s;ort, differ widely from one another in their dre&s;s, language, and manner of living. In the Upper and Lower Krain they wear long beards.

One part of the town is inhabited chiefly by butchers, another by fi&s;hermen, and another by mariners. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who &s;tands im|mediately under the pope; and has an old ca&s;tle, but is not very &s;trong, e&s;pecially towards the river.

<HEAD>MIDDLE-CARNIOLA.</HEAD>
<P>This divi&s;ion contains that tract commonly called Dry-Carniola, from its want of water, which, notwith&s;tanding, is pretty well inhabited; but its greate&s;t curio&s;ity is a lake, denominated from a &s;mall town in the neighbourhood, the Zirknitz or Cirk|nitz-&s;ee. This lake is about one German, or four Engli&s;h miles, in length, and half as much in breadth, contains three beautiful i&s;lands, and is encompa&s;&s;ed at &s;ome di&s;tance with mountains and fore&s;ts. But what is mo&s;t remarkable, is, that it di&s;appears generally once a-year, about St. John or St. James's day, running off through holes or pits in the bottom; &s;ometimes it will di&s;appear twice or thrice a-year; and &s;ometimes even in winter, if the weather be dry. On the other hand, it has been known to continue two or three years without running off. Of the holes or pits, there are five much larger than the re&s;t, each of which &s;ucce&s;&s;ively, when the water runs off, &s;tands empty
<PB N="245" REF="2490">
five days; &s;o that the whole lake becomes dry in twenty-five. As &s;oon as the beginning of the ebb is ob&s;erved, the fi&s;hing in the pits begins, which belongs to five &s;eigniories. The fi&s;h, which are carp, tench, pike, eels, and two other &s;orts, called &s;chleien and ruten, are caught by laying nets over the holes. Mr. Key&s;ler tells us, that upon the ringing of a bell at Zirknitz, when the waters begin to fall, the pea&s;ants, both men and women, run to the pools quite naked, notwith&s;tanding both the clergy and magi&s;trates have u&s;ed their utmo&s;t endeavours to &s;uppre&s;s &s;o indecent a cu&s;tom. When the water runs off early in the year, in about three weeks af|ter it is gone, there is good gra&s;s on the bot|tom, which is mowed down, and the bottom after|wards ploughed, and &s;owed with millet. If the water runs not off early, nothing can be &s;own; and if it returne &s;oon, the &s;eed is lo&s;t. With re&s;pect to its return, the water, at fir&s;t, bur&s;ts out of &s;ome pits on the &s;outh &s;ide with great violence, a little rain always falling at the &s;ame time; but af|terwards, (when the rain falls heavier, and it thun|ders at the &s;ame time &s;o loud, as to &s;hake the earth) it breaks out through all the apertures with great force, in&s;omuch that the lake is filled in eighteen or twenty-four hours, at which time it is in a man|ner covered with wild fowl, &s;uch as gee&s;e, ducks, &amp;c. After the millet-harve&s;t, all manner of game is hunted, caught, or killed in it. On the &s;outh &s;ide are two caverns, out of which, when it thun|ders, water i&s;&s;ues with a&s;toni&s;hing violence; and, if it happens in harve&s;t, a great many naked, black, and blind, but fat ducklings, are brought up with the water, which in fourteen days receive their &s;ight, and are covered with feathers.</P>

<HEAD>INNER-CARNIOLA.</HEAD>
<P>This divi&s;ion contains many mountains and vine|yards, but little corn-land or fre&s;h water.

The grotto of St. Mary Mag|dalen, near the market-town of Adl&s;berg, is un|commonly beautiful. A per&s;on would imagine that he walked round the ruined walls of an old magnificent palace, of which the &s;till in part un|damaged, and partly broken ruined columns &s;trike the eye.

The neighbouring dale yields good wine, figs, and other fruits. Formerly this town was incorporated with the duchy of Carniola, and bore a &s;hare of all its impo&s;ts; but now it is neither reckoned a part of Carniola, nor is &s;ubject to its taxes.

This town has a ca&s;tle, and is famous for its quick&s;ilver mines. The virgin|quick&s;ilver is found in numerous &s;mall drops, in many ores, upon beating them to pieces, and &s;ometimes trickles down through the veins of the mountains; but the common &s;ort is extracted by fire out of the ore. The virgin is much dearer than the common &s;ort, which is &s;old for two florins a pound. Sometimes two thou&s;and &s;ix hundred centners or hundred-weights, of the common &s;ort, are extracted in a year, and an hundred of the vir|gin collected.</P>

<HEAD>The COUNTIES of GORZ and GRADISCA.</HEAD>
<P>The county of Gorz, in Latin Comitatus Goritiae, is by geographers, but fal&s;ely, made a part of Carni|ola, has the captain&s;hip of Tulmino to the north; Carniola, and the Venetian territory of Mo&s;acolne, to the &s;outh; Carniola and the Idrian-Bottom to the ea&s;t; and to the we&s;t the Venetian Friuli. This county abounds in wine, red and white, &s;ilk, corn, fruit, and goats, but has little oil, and few hor&s;es or oxen. The river Li&s;onzo, antiently the Son|tius, and in Italian II Sontio, traver&s;es it, and falls into the Adriatic. People of note here &s;peak Ita|lian and German; but the lower &s;ort either Sclavo|nic, or a jargon made up of Italian and French, called Furlan, or Friulian. The Roman catholic is the only religion of the country. As to the ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;diction, it belonged not long ago to the patriarch of Aquileia, but now to the archbi|&s;hop of Gorz, who, with his chapter, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all the e&s;tates, revenues, and juri&s;diction in this county, that formerly belonged to the patriarch. Count Leonhard of Gorz dying, in 1500, without male heirs, the emperor Maximilian I. by virtue of certain antient &s;tipulations, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the county, and, ever &s;ince that time, it has con|&s;tantly remained in the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.

<P>As to the county of Gradi&s;ca, the lord lieute|nant of the county of Gorz is at the &s;ame time captain of Gradi&s;ca. The only place worth men|tioning in it is that from which it takes its name, viz. Gradi&s;ca, which is a little, but well-fortified town, on the river Li&s;onzo.</P>
<P>The territory of Aquileia al&s;o is governed by the lieutenant of Gorz. With re&s;pect to the patri|archate of Aquileia or Aglar, an agreement was made in 1751, between the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and the republic of Venice, which was confirmed by the pope. By virtue thereof, the patriarch&s;hip is quite aboli&s;hed, and in&s;tead of it, two archbi|&s;hoprics erected, viz. one at Gorz, and another at Udine. To the juri&s;diction of the former be|long the Au&s;trian countries, before &s;ubject to the patriarch; and to the latter, tho&s;e of Venice that were &s;ubject to him.

<HEAD>The COUNTY of TYROL.</HEAD>
<P>This county, with regard to the face of it, is very mountainous. Of the&s;e mountains, &s;ome have their tops always buried in &s;now; others are covered with woods, abounding with a va|riety of game; and others are rich in metals, and marble of all colours. Of the lower, &s;ome yield plenty of corn, others wine, and woods of che&s;nut trees. The vallies are exceeding fertile al&s;o and plea&s;ant. In &s;ome places con&s;iderable quanti|ties of flax are rai&s;ed, in others there is a good breed of hor&s;es and horned cattle, and, among the mountains, abundance of chamois and wild goats. In this country are al&s;o found precious &s;tones of &s;e|veral &s;orts, as granates, rubies, amethy&s;ts, emeralds, and a &s;pecies of diamonds, agates, cornelians, chal|cedonies, malachites, &amp;c. nor is it without hot|baths, acid-waters, &s;alt-pits, mines of &s;ilver, cop|per, and lead, mineral colours, alum, and vitriol. The principal river of Tyrol is the Inn, which after traver&s;ing the country, and receiving a number of le&s;&s;er &s;treams into it, enters Bavaria, in which, at Pa&s;&s;au, it falls into the Danube. The men here are very tall, robu&s;t, and vigorous; the women al&s;o are &s;tout, and generally fair: and both &s;exes have a mixture of the Italian and German in their tempers and characters. As there is little trade or manufacture in the country, except what
<PB N="254" REF="2580">
is occa&s;ioned by the mines and &s;alt works, many of the common people are obliged to &s;eek a &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence el&s;ewhere. A particular kind of &s;alu|tation is u&s;ed all over Tyrol. When a per&s;on comes into a hou&s;e, he &s;ays, <HI>Hail! Je&s;us Chri&s;t:</HI> the an&s;wer is, <HI>May Chri&s;t be prai&s;ed, and the Holy Virgin his mother.</HI> Then the ma&s;ter of the hou&s;e takes the vi&s;itor by the hand. This &s;alutation is fixed up in print at all the doors, with an adver|ti&s;ement tacked to it, importing, that pope Cle|ment XI. granted an hundred days indulgence, and a plenary ab&s;olution to tho&s;e who &s;hould pro|nounce the &s;alutation and an&s;wer, as often as they did it. The emperor has forts and citadels &s;o advantageou&s;ly &s;ituated on rocks and mountains all over the country, that they command all the val|lies, avenues, and pa&s;&s;es that lead into it. The inhabitants, however, to keep them in good hu|mour, are more gently treated, and not &s;o highly taxed, as tho&s;e of the other hereditary countries. As to the &s;tates, they are much the &s;ame in this coun|try as in the other Au&s;trian territories, except that the pea&s;ants here &s;end deputies to the diets. Tyrol came to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria in the year 1363, when Margaret, counte&s;s thereof, bequeathed it to her uncles the dukes of Au&s;tria. The arms of Tyrol are an eagle gules, in a field argent. The counts of Trap are hereditary &s;tewards; the lords of Glo&s;z, chamberlains; the princes of Traut&s;on, mar&s;hals; the counts of Wolken&s;tein, ma&s;ters of the hor&s;e and carvers; the hou&s;e of Spaur, cup|bearers; the counts of Kunigl, &s;ewers, and rangers; the counts of Brandis, keepers of the jewels; the hou&s;e of Wel&s;perg, purveyors and &s;taff-bearers; and the counts of Coalto, falconers. Be&s;ides the governor, here are three &s;overeign colleges, &s;ubor|dinate to the court at Vienna, which &s;it at In&s;pruck,
<PB N="255" REF="2590">
and have their different departments. Towards the expences of the military e&s;tabli&s;hment of this county, the proportion is one hundred thou&s;and florins, yearly; but no more than one regiment of foot is generally quartered in it.</P>
<P>Tyrol is divided into &s;ix quarters, as they are called, namely, tho&s;e of the Lower and Upper Innthal, Vint&s;gow, Et&s;ch, Ei&s;ack, and Pu&s;ter|thal.</P>
<DIV4>
<HEAD>The mo&s;t con&s;iderable places in the LOWER INN-THAL QUARTER are,</HEAD>
<P>In&s;pruck, or Yn&s;brug, in Latin Oenipons, or Oenipontium, the capital of the county, &s;ituated on the river Inn, fifty-&s;even miles &s;outh of Mu|nich, and two hundred and twenty-five we&s;t of Vienna. Its name is compounded of that of the river, and the German word pruck, prugg, bruck, or brugg, &s;ignifying a bridge. It is a little, but hand&s;ome and agreeable city, with large &s;uburbs, &s;tanding in a plea&s;ant valley, &s;urrounded with mountains, of which the lower parts are well cul|tivated, but the tops continually covered with &s;now. Formerly it was the re&s;idence of the arch|dukes, and at pre&s;ent of the governor and &s;ove|reign colleges. In the city and &s;uburbs are many fine palaces, churches, convents, fountains, mar|ket places, &amp;c. The ca&s;tle, where the antient counts, and princes of the Au&s;trian family, u&s;ed to re&s;ide, is &s;tately, large, and convenient, but not very regular or beautiful, as having been built at &s;everal times. It is adorned with &s;ome fine paintings, particularly the labours of Her|cules in fre&s;co, and a picture of Mary, queen of Scots. Here al&s;o is a cabinet of curious rarities, with natural and artificial fountains, &s;tatues, plea|&s;ant gardens, groves, walks, and covered galleries,
<PB N="256" REF="2600">
that lead from it to five different churches. Adjoin|ing to it is a wooden palace, whither the court u&s;ed to retire when an earthquake happened, to which the city, by being &s;hut up among &s;o many mountains, is frequently &s;ubject. The fortifications, it is &s;aid, are not extraordinary; but, about a mile off, is the &s;trong ca&s;tle of Amras, or Ambras, which commands the town. In the Franci&s;can church is a noble monument erected by Ferdinand I. to his grand-father Maximilian; and a chapel, called the &s;ilver chapel, becau&s;e there is an image of the Virgin of &s;olid &s;ilver, as big as the life, in the middle of the altar, together with many other images of &s;aints, all of the &s;ame metal. This is held to be one of the mo&s;t &s;acred and venerable chapels in the world, by the Roman catholics, on account of the indulgences granted to it by &s;everal popes, &s;o that one ma&s;s &s;aid in it is thought &s;uffi|cient to deliver a &s;oul from purgatory. In this city Chri&s;tina, queen of Sweden, fir&s;t abjured the prote&s;tant religion in 1655; and, in 1719, the prince&s;s Sobie&s;ki was detained here by the empe|ror's orders, when &s;he was going to Italy, to be married to the pretender: however, &s;he &s;oon made her e&s;cape, and was married to him.</P>
<P>Hall, which &s;tands a league north-ea&s;t of In|&s;pruck, on the Inn, and is reckoned the &s;econd city in Tyrol. It is famous for its &s;alt-works, there being, in this neighbourhood, a &s;alt-mine, out of which large blocks of &s;alt are dug, and thrown into pits filled with fre&s;h water; from whence the &s;alt, when melted, is conveyed by wooden troughs to Hall, and there boiled in huge pans or ci&s;terns. A great number of pea|&s;ants are continually employed in felling trees in the woods of fir, with which the double range of mountains along the Inn are covered. The&s;e being rolled down from the mountains into the river,
<PB N="257" REF="2610">
are conveyed by it to In&s;pruck and Halle. The &s;altworks and the mint (in the la&s;t of which a great deal of money is coined of the copper and &s;ilver dug out of the mines of Tyrol, wherein, it is &s;aid, &s;even thou&s;and men, women, and children, are con&s;tantly employed) with the great trade driven on in copper and tin by means of the Inn, make this a very flouri&s;hing place, tho' in the neighbourhood of In&s;pruck.</P>
<P>Kuff&s;tein, a fortified little town on the Inn, near which is a &s;trong ca&s;tle, hewn out of a rock, and called Gerolzeg.</P>
<P>Rattenberg, a &s;mall, but &s;trong town, with a ca&s;tle, on the Inn.</P>
<P>Kitzbichl, the capital of a &s;eigniory, belonging to the count of Lamberg, and containing one hun|dred and fifty-&s;even villages and hamlets.</P>
<P>Schwatz, a very fine market-town on the Inn, near which is a mine of copper, mixed with &s;ilver. This mine yields about twenty thou&s;and marks of &s;ilver in a-year, at the rate of one mark for every forty pounds of copper. Blue and green mineral colours are al&s;o found here.</P>
<P>Ambras, or Ombras, a royal palace and ca&s;tle on an eminence in the neighbourhood of In&s;pruck and Halle, containing an ar&s;enal with a prodigious collection of curio&s;ities, con&s;i&s;ting of a va&s;t num|ber of medals, precious &s;tones, &s;uits of armour, rich trappings, &s;tatues of &s;everal princes on hor&s;e|back, in their old rich tilting accountrements, a great variety of &s;poils and trophies, taken in &s;ome of the mo&s;t important victories obtained by the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, for two or three hundred years. In particular here are the &s;tatues of Francis I. on hor&s;eback, repre&s;enting him and his hor&s;e, ju&s;t as they were taken in the battle of Pavia; and of two Turki&s;h ba&s;haws, with the co&s;tly habits and har|ne&s;&s;es with which they were taken, embelli&s;hed with
<PB N="258" REF="2620">
gold, &s;ilver, and precious &s;tones. Here is al&s;o a very extraordinary natural curio&s;ity, namely, an oak inclo&s;ing the body of a deer. The pro&s;pect from the ca&s;tle is very &s;triking and agreeable.</P>

<HEAD>The mo&s;t remarkable places in the UPPER INN|THAL QUARTER are,</HEAD>
<P>Cirl, or Zirl, on the river Inn, near which is the &s;teep rock of Martin&s;wand, where Maximilian I. in the too warm pur&s;uit of a chamois, very nar|rowly e&s;caped with his life. On the top of the rock a wooden cro&s;s hath been erected, which, tho' forty feet high, appears from below to be &s;carce two feet in height, &s;o lofty is the rock. Near the cro&s;s are al&s;o the images of St. John and the Virgin Mary as big as the life.</P>

<P>Tyrol, antiently Terioli, a &s;mall market-town, whence the country takes its name. It &s;tands in a plea&s;ant valley, and contains a &s;tately antient ca&s;tle, in which re&s;ides a burgrave, who has a large ju|ri&s;diction.

<P>One of the dales, or vallies, in this quarter, is called Sugan, in Latin Vallis Euganea, from its antient inhabitants the Euganei. At the extremi|ty

<HEAD>The AUSTRIAN TERRITORIES in SWABIA.</HEAD>
<P>The&s;e territories, on account of which the arch|dukes &s;tile them&s;elves princes of Swabia, and which, towards the expences of the military e&s;tabli&s;hment, contribute annually an hundred and twenty thou|&s;and florins, comprehend, the imperial landvog|tey in Swabia; the town of Co&s;tnitz, Co&s;tanz, or Con&s;tance, with its territory; the margravate or marqui&s;ate of Burgau; the county of Kirchberg, or Wei&s;&s;enhorn; the county of Hohenberg; the landgravate of Nellenburg; the Au&s;trian Bri&s;gaw; the four fore&s;t towns, lying on the Rhine; the landvogtey of Ortenau; with &s;everal &s;mall towns and &s;eigniories.</P>
<P>The extent of the landvogtey of Swabia cannot be ea&s;ily determined, being &s;o much inter&s;ected by other territories. It is divided into the Upper and Low|er, and is tolerably fertile, producing corn, and in &s;ome places wine. The pea&s;ants here are little better than &s;laves, having hardly any thing that they can call their own, and no other religion but the Roman catholic is tolerated. The only place in the territory of any note is,</P>
<P>Altorf, a market-town, endowed with con&s;ider|able privileges and immunities, and the &s;eat of the chief tribunal.</P>
<P><PB N="263" REF="2670">
Con&s;tance, Co&s;tanz, or Co&s;nitz, in Latin Con&s;tan|tia, an antient city on the lake to which it gives name, was formerly an imperial city, but Ferdinand I. in the year 1549, brought it under the power of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. It is well fortified, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who does not, however, re&s;ide in it, but at Mer&s;berg. Diets of the empire have been often held in this city; but of all the a&s;&s;em|blies held in it, that &s;tiled the council of Con&s;tance, is the mo&s;t famous. It was called by the emperor Sigi&s;mund, when there was a great &s;chi&s;m in the church, and no le&s;s than three popes, one &s;et up by the Italians, a &s;econd by the French, and a third by the Spaniards; who were all three de|po&s;ed, and a new one, viz. Martin V. cho&s;en. This council likewi&s;e condemned the doctrines of Wickliff, John Hu&s;s, and Jerom of Prague, cau&s;ing the bones of the fir&s;t to be dug up and burnt, and the two la&s;t to be burnt alive, though the former had a &s;afe-conduct granted him by the emperor. This was the greate&s;t oecumeni|cal &s;ynod that was ever held, and continued from the year 1414 to 1418. It is &s;aid there were an hundred thou&s;and foreigners in and about Con|&s;tance at that time. Of the&s;e the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, with their retinues, made upwards of eighteen thou&s;and. There were al&s;o, it is &s;aid, three hundred and forty-&s;ix jugglers and &s;tage-players, and fifteen hundred harlots. Some will be apt to wonder, how the latter could find any cu&s;tom or encouragement, on &s;o &s;o|lemn an occa&s;ion. The council, one would ima|gine, mu&s;t have had a great deal of &s;pare time on their hands; for, though they &s;at &s;everal years, all they did was the depo&s;ing three infallible popes, &s;etting up a new one, and burning two hone&s;t men, becau&s;e they had the audaciou&s;ne&s;s and impiety to attempt to &s;hake off the yoke of eccle&s;ia&s;tical ty|ranny,
<PB N="264" REF="2680">
to open the eyes of the laity, and to expo&s;e the mon&s;trous corruptions and impo&s;itions of the church of Rome. The&s;e councils were never of any real &s;ervice to Chri&s;tianity and true religion; they only &s;erved to rivet the chains of the laity, and to ruin and extirpate all tho&s;e who had the courage and hone&s;ty to attempt to break them. We had al|mo&s;t forgot to mention that infamous canon made here, namely, that faith is not to be kept with he|retics, nor tho&s;e &s;u&s;pected of here&s;y, which was neither more or le&s;s than e&s;tabli&s;hing villainy and perfidiou&s;ne&s;s by law; for what was that they called here&s;y, again&s;t which the&s;e &s;piritual thunders were levelled, but integrity, honour, virtue, and reli|gion, every thing, in fact, that is noble, generous, great, and good? But to return to Con&s;tance. It is a very pretty city, plea&s;antly &s;ituated on the &s;outh &s;ide of the lake, where the Rhine i&s;&s;ues out of it, three hundred and twenty-five miles we&s;t of Vienna. Some a&s;cribe the founding of it to Con|&s;tantine the Great, or his father Con&s;tantius Chlo|rus; but others think it more antient. The hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, under the title of protector, maintains a governor and garri&s;on here, and allows the city mo&s;t of its antient privileges; for, as we ob&s;erved already, it was once a free imperial city; but on refu&s;ing to conform to the Interim, a religious re|gulation formed by Charles V. it was be&s;ieged, taken, and &s;ubjected to the Au&s;trian family. A con&s;iderable trade is carried on here by means of the lake, and the Rhine which runs out of the lake, about a mu&s;ket-&s;hot below the town. The build|ing, where the above council met, is &s;till &s;hewn to &s;trangers, together with the wicket through which they conveyed victuals to the venerable fathers, who compo&s;ed it. The bi&s;hop has no authority at pre&s;ent in the town.</P>

The margravate of Burgau lies between the Danube and the Lech. It came to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria in 1283, upon the death of its la&s;t mar|grave Henry. There are only two towns in it of any note, viz.</P>
<P>Burgau, and Gunzburg. The former is the capi|tal, has an old ca&s;tle, and &s;tands on the river Min|del: the latter &s;tands on the Danube, is a great thoroughfare, and has a magnificent ca&s;tle, the re|&s;idence of the Au&s;trian governor.</P>
<P>The county of Kirchberg, or Wei&s;&s;enhorn, is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed as a male-fief by the Raymund branch of the noble family of Fuggers. The only place in it worth mentioning is,</P>

<P>The county of Hohenberg was purcha&s;ed in the year 1381, by the Au&s;trian duke Leopold, of count Rudolph, for &s;ixty-&s;ix thou&s;and florins. It contains &s;everal &s;mall towns, cloi&s;ters, and ca&s;tles.</P>
<P>The landgravate of Nellenburg came to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria by purcha&s;e. It is about twenty-&s;even miles long, and twelve broad, and the inha|bitants are Calvini&s;ts, under the protection of the Swi&s;s cantons.</P>
<P>The Au&s;trian Bri&s;gaw came to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, by purcha&s;e, in the year 1367. The prin|cipal places in it are,</P>
<P>Friburg, the capital, which is &s;ituate on the river Trei&s;am, on the edge of the Black-Fore&s;t, and was founded in 1118, by duke Berthold of Zahringen, and endowed with many immunities. It was former|ly
<PB N="266" REF="2700">
very &s;trong, and had &s;tood many &s;ieges; but its fortifications were demoli&s;hed by the French, in 1745. The town is large, populous, and wealthy, having an univer&s;ity, a college of Je&s;uits, and &s;e|veral cloi&s;ters. The lapidaries here are famous for poli&s;hing the granates, ja&s;pers, and other precious &s;tones, that are found in Lorrain and the neigh|bouring countries. The tower of the great church is &s;o high, &s;o curiou&s;ly carved and con&s;tructed, that there is nothing of that kind in Germany to be compared to it, except that of Stra&s;burg.</P>
<P>Bri&s;ack, or Old Bri&s;ack, to di&s;tingui&s;h it from the New, which was built and &s;trongly fortified by the French on the other &s;ide the Rhine, in Al|&s;ace. Old Bri&s;ack came to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria by mortgage, and was once an imperial city. It was reckoned very &s;trong until 1741, when its fortifications were razed, by order of the queen of Hungary.</P>
<P>Neuburg on the Rhine, which was formerly an imperial town, but in the fourteenth century fell under the dominion of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria.</P>
<P>Zahringen, a de&s;olate ca&s;tle near Freyburg, from which the antient dukes of Zahringen took their title.</P>
<P>The abbey of St. Bla&s;e, who&s;e abbot, in 1747, was made a prince of the empire. He is al&s;o hereditary arch - aulic - chaplain of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, in the Anterior Au&s;trian countries, but &s;ubject, in &s;pirituals, to the bi&s;hop of Con|&s;tance.</P>

<HEAD>FACE of the COUNTRY, AIR, SOIL, and PRODUE.</HEAD>
<P>Bohemia is &s;urrounded by high mountains and woods, and every province divided from another by a chain of mountains. It enjoys but an indif|ferent air, for tho' it is warm and plea&s;ant, it is not accounted very whole&s;ome; and this is &s;up|po&s;ed to be partly owing to the large thick woods with which it abounds. The &s;oil is &s;aid to be rich in general, tho' in &s;ome places &s;andy. It is well watered by the rivers Muldaw, Egra, Oder, Vi&s;|tula, Moraw, Teyn, and Igla. It produces corn, buck-wheat, and millet, fruits, excellent hops, &s;affron, ginger, calamus, a &s;ort of pannick, or fox|tail, good red wines, and pa&s;ture, flax, wool, and timber. They have a &s;trong large breed of hor&s;es, great numbers of which are often bought up to remount the French cavalry. Its mountains are

the riche&s;t in Europe in gold, &s;ilver, precious &s;tones, copper, quick&s;ilver, iron, lead, tin, &s;ulphur, and &s;altpetre. This country yields al&s;o terta &s;igillata, or &s;ealed earth, Mu&s;covy-gla&s;s, &s;tone, or pit-coal, alum, vitriolic water, marble, mineral waters, and hot baths. La&s;tly, here are numerous herds of cattle, plenty of game and wild-fowl, with bears, lynxes, wolves, foxes, martens, badgers, beavers, otters, and in the rivers and ponds are well-ta&s;ted fi&s;h of all &s;orts.</P>

<HEAD>CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>Bohemia, for a con&s;iderable time, was governed by dukes, and afterwards by kings, who were li|mited in their power, and elected by the &s;tates; tho' they u&s;ually kept to the family of the decea&s;ed monarch. After the battle of the White Moun|tain, in 1620, the crown was made hereditary in the Au&s;trian family; &s;o that, from that time, the &s;tates have had nothing more to do with re&s;pect to the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The &s;tates, indeed, are &s;ummoned every year by the command of the em|pre&s;s-queen, and meet at Prague; but it is only for form's &s;ake. They con&s;i&s;t of the clergy, nobi|lity, gentry, and repre&s;entatives of the towns. Here a commi&s;&s;ioner from the &s;overeign lays be|fore them the nece&s;&s;ity of granting &s;uch &s;upplies as the court demands, which u&s;ually amounts to a
<PB N="276" REF="2800">
very great &s;um; and the&s;e are granted, without he&s;itation, or examination: only they &s;ometimes expre&s;s their concern at the ab&s;ence of their prince, and &s;eem grieved, that their country is exhau&s;ted to enrich the Au&s;trians, for whom they have an im|placable aver&s;ion. The pea&s;ants here are bond|men to their lords, and to the hard yoke which galls them is doubtle&s;s owing, in a great mea&s;ure, both their perver&s;e ob&s;tinate di&s;po&s;ition, and their indolence; the latter of which, among other things, is evident from the wretched condition of the vil|lages, which, tho' wood is to be &s;ound here in great plenty, and building is far from being ex|pen&s;ive, are very mean and de&s;picably. In the year 1679, a great part of them took up arms on ac|count of the heavy bondage they laboured under. The clergy are compo&s;ed of the archbi&s;hop of Prague, &s;everal bi&s;hops, provo&s;ts, and abbots, be&s;ides the in&s;erior clergy. The nobility are di|vided into princes, counts, and barons; and the next degrees to the&s;e are knights, burghers, hu&s;|bandmen, and pea&s;ants. Bohemia is divided into twelve circles; but the city of Prague, on account of its dignity, is not included in any circle. Each of the&s;e circles has two headmen or captains, one out of the &s;tate of lords, and one out of the &s;tate of knights. The county of Glatz was ceded in the year 1742 to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, and by him add|ed to Sile&s;ia. Bohemia is generally con&s;idered as a part of Germany, but with very little rea&s;on, for it is not in any of the nine circles, neither doth it contribute any thing towards the forces, or re|venues of the empire, or is &s;ubject to any of its laws.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>RELIGION.</HEAD>
<P>The Bohemians are &s;uppo&s;ed to have received the Chri&s;tian faith &s;o early as the &s;ixth century; but if not then, it is certain they did in the ninth, and their religion was that of the Greek church, till Bole&s;laus, &s;urnamed the Good, introduced po|pery among them. John Hu&s;s and Jerom of Prague were burnt at the council of Con&s;tance, in the fifteenth century, for endeavouring to bring about a reformation in religion. This occa&s;ioned a bloody war, which continued for many years; but the Hu&s;&s;ites were wor&s;ted, and, in 1547, the greater part of them was obliged to quit their country; upon which they withdrew to the neigh|bouring dominions, e&s;pecially Poland and Pru&s;&s;ia. However, when Luther appeared, great numbers of the Bohemians embraced his doctrine, and the&s;e at fir&s;t had a toleration; but afterwards, being per&s;ecuted, they took up arms, and, in 1618, cho&s;e Frederic V. elector Palatine, for their king: but the war ended unfortunately, both for the king and the prote&s;tant Bohemians. In con&s;equence of this, they were deprived, in 1627, of all their rights and privileges; and &s;uch as would not &s;ubmit to the Roman catholic church, were compelled to quit the country. However, there are a few Lutherans
<PB N="278" REF="2820">
&s;till remaining here; but they are obliged to be upon their guard, and to conceal them&s;elves as much as po&s;&s;ible. The Jews at Prague are more indulged, and have a very open toleration. The archbi&s;hop of Prague is born legate of the holy apo&s;tolic &s;ee of Rome, and crowns the king of Bo|hemia. He is al&s;o a prince of the Holy Roman empire, though he has no &s;eat in the diets, primate of the kingdom, and perpetual chancellor of the univer&s;ity of Prague. His &s;uffragans are the bi&s;hops of Leutmeritz, and Konigingratz. The government of the church and clergy is ve&s;ted in the archiepi&s;copal con&s;i&s;tory, from which an appeal lies either to the queen or pope.</P>

<HEAD>REVENUES and FORCES.</HEAD>

The revenue of Bohemia is &s;aid to amount to near one million &s;terling a-year. The wealth and grandeur of the nobility form a very &s;triking and affecting contra&s;t with the poverty and &s;lavery of the pea&s;ants. The latter, in a rich and plentiful country, are &s;tarving, both their per&s;ons and effects being entirely at the mercy of their lords, without who&s;e permi&s;&s;ion they cannot &s;o much as earn a mor&s;el of bread to them|&s;elves.

The whole is about twelve miles in circumference, and but thinly inhabited. The fortifications are not of great importance, as it may be flanked and raked on all &s;ides. However, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia was not able to make him&s;elf ma&s;ter of it in the late war, though he almo&s;t de&s;troyed it with his bombs, &amp;c. It &s;tands in a plea&s;ant and fruitful country, in the mid&s;t of gardens, fine fields, palaces, and plea&s;ure-hou&s;es. It hath &s;uffered greatly by &s;ieges, and hath been often taken and plundered. The univer&s;ity was founded by Charles IV. in the year 1347. The Je&s;uits here have two very large col|leges, with a fine library and ob&s;ervatory. In 1409, when John Hu&s;s was rector of the univer&s;ity, there were no le&s;s than forty-four thou&s;and &s;tu|dents,

and when the emperor Charles V. would have retrenched their privileges, twenty-four thou|&s;and are &s;aid to have left it in one week, and &s;ixteen thou&s;and in a &s;hort time after. The Jews have the trade of this city almo&s;t entirely in their own hands. They deal in all &s;orts of commodities, e&s;pecially the precious &s;tones found in the Bohemian mines, and, by receiving all old-fa&s;hioned things in payment, quite ruin the Chri&s;tian handicraft&s;men. In 1744 they nar|rowly e&s;caped being expelled the kingdom, having been &s;u&s;pected of corre&s;ponding with the Pru&s;&s;ians, when they made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of the city. The grand prior of the order of Malta, for Bohe|mia, Moravia, and Sile&s;ia, re&s;ides here; and the church and ho&s;pital of the Holy Gho&s;t is the &s;eat of the general and grand-ma&s;ters of the holy order of Knights of the Cro&s;s with the red Star, re&s;iding in the above-mentioned countries, and in Poland and Hungary. The cathedral is dedicated to St. Veit, and adorned with many magnificent tombs of great per&s;onages. On Rat&s;chin-hill, in Upper-Prague, mo&s;t of the nobility have hou&s;es, and the emperor a very magnificent palace, with a &s;ummer-hou&s;e, commanding one of the fine&s;t pro&s;pects in the world. Here the tribunals of the regency meet, and the halls, galleries, and other apartments, are adorned with a multitude of noble pictures. The great hall, where the coronation-fea&s;t is kept, is &s;aid to be the large&s;t of the kind in Europe, next to that of We&s;tmin&s;ter. The ca&s;tle &s;tands on the above-mentioned mountain, called Rat&s;chin, or the White Mountain, and is very &s;trong. It was from a window of this ca&s;tle that the emperor's coun&s;ellors were thrown in 1618; but tho' they fell from a great height, yet they were not kill|ed, nor indeed much hurt.

The &s;tables of the latter are very grand, the racks being of &s;teel, and the mangers of marble, with a marble pillar betwixt each hor&s;e; over each hor&s;e al&s;o is placed his pic|ture, as big as the life. Though the inhabitants of Prague in general are poor, and their &s;hops but meanly furni&s;hed; yet, it is &s;aid, there are few cities where the nobility and gentry are more wealthy, and live in greater &s;tate. Here is much gaming, ma&s;querading, fea&s;ting, and very &s;plendid public balls, with an Italian opera, and a&s;&s;em|blies in the hou&s;es of the quality every night. On the White Mountain, near the town, was fought the battle, in which the prote&s;tants, with the elector Palatine Frederic, their king, were de|feated. The lu&s;tres and drinking gla&s;&s;es made here of Bohemian chry&s;tal are much e&s;teemed, and vended all over Europe. The&s;e chry&s;tals are al&s;o poli&s;hed by the Jews, and &s;et in rings, ear-pendants, and &s;hirt-buttons.

It is bounded to the &s;outh by Au&s;tria; to the north by Glatz and Sile&s;ia; to the we&s;t by Bohe|mia; and to the ea&s;t by Sile&s;ia and Hungary: be|ing about one hundred and twenty miles in length, and one hundred in breadth.</P>
<P>A great part of this country is over-run with woods and mountains, where the air is very cold, but much whole&s;omer than in the low grounds, which are full of bogs and lakes. The mountains, in general, are barren; but the more champaign parts tolerably fertile, yielding corn, with plenty of hemp and flax, good &s;affron, and pa&s;ture. Nor

is it altogether de&s;titute of wine, red and white, fruits, and garden &s;tuff. Moravia al&s;o abounds in hor&s;es, black cattle, &s;heep, and goats. In the woods and about the lakes there is plenty of wild fowl, game, veni&s;on, bees, honey, hares, foxes, wolves, beavers, and a bea&s;t of prey, called Ry&s;owe, about the &s;ize of a dog, having its belly and feet &s;potted, and leaping &s;uddenly on its prey, from rocks or trees. In this country are likewi&s;e quarries of marble, ba&s;tard diamonds, amethy&s;ts, alum, iron, &s;ulphur, &s;alt-petre, and vitriol, with whole&s;ome mineral waters, and warm &s;prings; but &s;alt is imported. Its rivers, of which the March, Morawa, or Morau, are the chief, abound with trout, crayfi&s;h, barbels, cels, jack, perch, and many other &s;orts of fi&s;h.</P>
<P>The language of the inhabitants is a dialect of the Sclavonic, differing little from the Bohemian; but the nobility and citizens &s;peak German and French.</P>
<P>Moravia was antiently inhabited by the Quadi, who were driven out by the Sclavi. Its kings, who were once powerful and independent, after|wards became dependent on, and tributary to the German emperors and kings. At la&s;t, in the year 908, the Moravian kingdom was parcelled out a|mong the Germans, Poles, and Hungarians. In 1086, that part of it properly called Moravia, was declared a marqui&s;ate by the German king, Henry IV. and united with Bohemia, to who&s;e dukes and kings, it hath ever &s;ince been &s;ubject. Tho' it is not very populous, it contains about forty-two greater or walled towns, &s;eventeen &s;maller or open towns, and one hundred and ninety-eight market-towns, be&s;ides villages, &amp;c. The &s;tates of the country con&s;i&s;t of the clergy, lords, knights, and burge&s;&s;es; and the diets, when &s;ummoned by the regency, are held at Brunn. The marqui&s;ate is
<PB N="295" REF="2990">
&s;till governed by its own peculiar con&s;titutions, under the directorium in publicis &amp; camera|libus, and the &s;upreme judicatory at Vienna. It is divided into &s;ix circles, each of which has its captain, and contributes, to its &s;overeign, about one|third of what is exacted of Bohemia. Towards the expences of the military e&s;tabli&s;hment of the whole Au&s;trian hereditary countries, its yearly quota is one million eight hundred and fifty-&s;ix thou&s;and four hundred and ninety florins. Seven regiments of foot, one of cuira&s;&s;iers, and one of dragoons, are u&s;ually quartered in it.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity was planted in this country in the ninth century, and the inhabitants continued at|tached to the church of Rome till the fifteenth, when they e&s;pou&s;ed the doctrine of John Hu&s;s, and threw off popery; but after the defeat of the elector Palatine, whom they had cho&s;en king, as well as the Bohemians, the emperor Ferdinand II. re-e&s;tabli&s;hed popery. However, there are &s;till &s;ome prote&s;tants in Moravia; and not long &s;ince a &s;et of enthu&s;ia&s;ts, called Hernhutters, or Mora|vian Brethren, headed by one of the counts of Zinzindorf, appeared among them, who, at fir&s;t, met with great encouragement in England, but af|terwards, when their tenets and practices came to be better known, fell into contempt; though they have &s;till &s;ome followers among the lower &s;ort. The bi&s;hop of Olmutz, who &s;tands immediately under the pope, is at the head of the eccle&s;ia&s;tics in this country. The &s;upreme eccle&s;ia&s;tical juri&s;|diction, under the bi&s;hop, is ve&s;ted in a con&s;i&s;tory. In Moravia, Poland, and Bohemia, the prie&s;ts are called Knez, which, in the Sclavonic, &s;ignifies a prince; and, though originally u&s;ed only as a compliment, &s;hews the abject &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion and re|&s;pect paid to them.</P>
<P><PB N="296" REF="3000">
The commerce of this country is incon&s;iderable. Of what they have, Brunn enjoys the principal part. At Iglau and Trebitz are manufactures of cloth, paper, gunpowder, &amp;c. There are al&s;o &s;ome iron-works and gla&s;s hou&s;es in the country.</P>
<P>The inhabitants of Moravia, in general, are open-hearted, not ea&s;y to be provoked or pacified, obedient to their ma&s;ters, true to their promi&s;es, but credulous of old prophecies, and much ad|dicted to drinking; tho' neither &s;uch &s;ots, or bigots, as they are repre&s;ented by &s;ome geographers. The boors, indeed, upon the river Hanak, are &s;aid to be a thievi&s;h, unpoli&s;hed, brutal race. The &s;ciences now begin to lift up their heads a little among the Moravians, the univer&s;ity of Olmutz having been put on a better footing; and a riding academy, with a learned &s;ociety, have been lately e&s;tabli&s;hed there.</P>
<P>Moravia being divided into circles, we &s;hall give &s;ome account of the chief places in each of them.</P>

<HEAD>The principal places in that of OLMUTZ are,</HEAD>
<P>Holomauc, or Olmutz, the capital of the mar|qui&s;ate, a &s;mall, but neat, well-built, populous city, on the river Morawa, eighty miles north of Vienna. It is divided into the Old and New Town, in which are &s;ome &s;pacious, regular &s;treets, with fine hou&s;es, all painted on the out&s;ide, two great &s;quares, a cathedral dedicated to St. Wenzel, (where it is &s;aid St. Cyril is interred) &s;everal ho&s;pi|tals and cloi&s;ters of monks and nuns, a college and &s;eminary of Je&s;uits, an univer&s;ity, riding academy, learned &s;ociety, and twenty-&s;ix churches. It is a royal borough, and the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop; and, by means of its river, carries on a con&s;iderable trade

There are &s;ix cloi&s;ters, a collegiate church, the bi&s;hops pa|lace, and a college of Je&s;uits in the town, with an ho&s;pital of the knights of Malta in the &s;u|burbs. The cloi&s;ter of Augu&s;tine hermits is famous for an image of the virgin Mary, made, as they pretend, by St. Luke, and a foundation for young ladies. The citadel is called Spielberg, or Spilmberg, and &s;tands on a mountain clo&s;e to the town.</P>
<P>Wi&s;kow, or Wi&s;chau, a walled town, which, about a dozen years ago, was almo&s;t entirely burnt down. Without the town is a Capuchin cloi&s;ter.</P>

<HEAD>The Marqui&s;ates of UPPER and LOWER LUSATIA.</HEAD>
<P>LUSATIA is bounded to the ea&s;t by Sile&s;ia, to the we&s;t by Mi&s;nia, to the &s;outh by Bohe|mia, and to the north by the marqui&s;ate of Bran|denburg. Till towards the middle of the fifteenth century, the Upper Lu&s;atia was called the Mark, i. e. the marqui&s;ate or the land of Budi&s;zin and Gorlitz; and the Lower only Lu&s;atia, which, it is &s;aid, in the Sclavonic, &s;ignifies a woody, or mar&s;hy country. The air of the Upper Lu&s;atia, which is hilly and mountainous, is better than that of the Lower, a great part of which is moori&s;h and boggy. Both abound in wood, e&s;pecially the Lower, and turf for fuel. The heathy and moun|tainous tracts are generally barren; but the lower champaign and mar&s;h lands, are tolerably fertile, producing pa&s;ture, wheat, rye, oats, barley, buck wheat, peas, lentils, beans, and millet; together with flax, hops, tobacco, &s;ome white and red wine, and what is called manna. Of &s;everal of the&s;e ar|ticles, however, con&s;iderable quantities are im|ported. In this country are found al&s;o quarries of &s;tone, medicinal &s;prings, ba&s;tard diamonds, agates, and ja&s;pers, earths, and clays for tobacco pipes, and all &s;orts of earthen ware, alum, good iron, &s;tone, vitriolic and copper water; nor is it de&s;titute of cattle, fi&s;h, and veni&s;on. The rivers Spree, the Schwarze, or Black El&s;ter, and the Pulznitz, have their &s;ources in the Lu&s;atias, which are al&s;o watered by the Nei&s;&s;e and Queis. The antient in|habitants of this country were the Saxons, who were &s;ucceeded by the Vandals, and the&s;e by the Sorber-Wends, a Sclavonian people. The pre&s;ent
<PB N="303" REF="3070">
inhabitants, the de&s;cendants of the Wends, have an odd dre&s;s, and the language is &s;o inarticulate and guttural, that it hath been &s;aid, it might be pro|nounced without lips, teeth, or tongue; but the towns are almo&s;t wholly peopled by Germans.</P>
<P>In the Upper-Lu&s;atia are &s;ix towns which appear at the land diets, &s;ixteen &s;maller country towns, and four market-towns. In the Lower are four diet-towns, thirteen country-towns, and two market ones. Both marqui&s;ates were formerly &s;ubject ei|ther to the kings of Bohemia, the archdukes of Au|&s;tria, or electors of Brandenburg; but, in 1636, both were ab&s;olutely ceded to the elector of Saxo|ny, in lieu of the &s;eventy-two tons of gold, which he expended in a&s;&s;i&s;ting the emperor Ferdinand II. again&s;t the Bohemians.</P>
<P>Chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t planted in Lu&s;atia in the &s;e|venth century, but it was &s;everal centuries after that before popery was fully e&s;tabli&s;hed. In the eleventh century many cloi&s;ters were erected in the country; but at the reformation &s;uch numbers embraced Lu|therani&s;m, that it became the predominant reli|gion, and &s;till continues, though there are &s;till &s;e|veral Roman catholic foundations, churches, mar|ket-towns, and villages. The enthu&s;ia&s;tic &s;ect of Herrenhuther's unhappily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es a great influence and e&s;teem here. There are con&s;iderable manu|factures of woollen and linen &s;tuffs in the Lu&s;atias, e&s;pecially the Upper. At Budi&s;&s;en, and in the adja|cent country, prodigious quantities of &s;tockings, &s;patterda&s;hes, caps, and gloves are made. The linen manufactures al&s;o flouri&s;h here, chiefly in the Upper-Lu&s;atia, where all &s;orts of linen are made, printed, and dyed. Exclu&s;ive of the&s;e, there are con&s;iderable manufactures of hats, leather, paper, gunpowder, iron, gla&s;s, bleached wax, &amp;c. Tho' the demand and exportation of the&s;e commodities, particularly linens and woollens, is not &s;o great as
<PB N="304" REF="3080">
formerly, yet it is &s;till con&s;iderable, and more than overbalances their importations in wool, yarn, &s;ilk, wines, &s;pices, corn, fre&s;h and baked fruits, garden &s;tuff, and hops. Di&s;putes of many years &s;tanding have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between the country artificers and li|nen-manufacturers on the one &s;ide, and the diet-towns on the other; the latter unju&s;tly &s;eeking to exclude the former from any &s;hare in the linen trade. The natives of this country are &s;aid to have quick natural parts, but to be &s;ordidly penurious. We are told they ob&s;erve the Saxon laws much better than they did the Bohemian. Learning hath been much e&s;teemed and encouraged in both marqui&s;ates &s;ince the reformation. The &s;chools in the &s;ix diet-towns of Upper-Lu&s;atia, particularly at Gorlitz, Budi&s;&s;en, and Zittau, greatly di&s;tingui&s;h them|&s;elves, having hand&s;ome &s;tipends. In Lower Lu|&s;atia al&s;o are &s;ome good &s;chools, with &s;tipends for the maintenance of &s;tudents. Printing is &s;aid to be much followed, and brought to great perfec|tion in this country.</P>

<HEAD>SILESIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS duchy is bounded to the ea&s;t by Po|land; to the we&s;t by Moravia, Bohemia, Lu|&s;atia, and the county of Glatz; to the north by a chain of mountains, and a thicket of con&s;iderable extent, which &s;eparates it from Hungary; and to the north by the mark of Brandenburg. From north-we&s;t to &s;outh-ea&s;t it is about two hundred and twenty-five miles, and about an hundred where broade&s;t; but it is much contracted at both ends. Upon the frontiers of this country, to the we&s;t and &s;outh, are very high mountains, and &s;ome likewi&s;e in other parts of it. One of the ridges upon the frontiers is &s;tiled the Riphaean Mountains, ano|ther the Moravian, another the Bohemian, and another the Hungarian, Crapack, or Carpathian. A branch of the Bohemian is called the Giant Mountains. The winter on the&s;e hilly tracts is more &s;evere, &s;ets in &s;ooner, and la&s;ts longer, than in the low lands. The inhabitants u&s;e a kind of &s;kaits when the &s;now is deep, as they do in Carniola. Little or no grain is rai&s;ed in the mountains, and &s;ome &s;andy tracts; but the re&s;t of the country is abundantly fruitful, not only in grain, but fruits, roots, pa&s;ture, flax, hops, madder, tobacco, and hemp, yielding al&s;o &s;ome wine, with con&s;iderable quantities of &s;ilk and honey. In many places are great woods of pines, fir, beech, larch, and other trees, affording tar, pitch, ro&s;in, turpentine, lamp-black, and timber for all u&s;es. In this country al&s;o is found marble of &s;everal &s;orts, &s;ome precious &s;tones, lime&s;tone, mill&s;tone, pit-coal, turf, vitriol, &s;ome &s;ilver ore, cop|per,

lead, iron, and mineral &s;prings. Great num|bers of black cattle and hor&s;es are brought hither from Poland and Hungary for &s;ale, tho&s;e bred in the country not being &s;ufficient; but of &s;heep, goats, game, and veni&s;on, they have great plenty. As for wild-bea&s;ts, here are lynxes, foxes, wea&s;els, otters, and beavers. The rivers, lakes, and ponds, yield fi&s;h of &s;everal &s;orts, particularly &s;turgeons &s;everal ells in length, and &s;al|mon. Be&s;ides a number of &s;maller &s;treams to water this country, there is the Oder, which traver&s;es it almo&s;t from one end to the other, and the Vi&s;tula, which, after a pretty long cour&s;e through it, enters Poland. The number of the cities and market-towns is &s;aid to be about two hundred, the county of Glatz included, and that of the villages five thou&s;and. The inhabitants, who are computed to be about a million and an half, are a mixture of Ger|mans, Poles, and Moravians. The language ge|nerally &s;poken is German, but in &s;ome places the vulgar tongue is a dialect of the Sclavonic. The &s;tates con&s;i&s;t of the princes and dukes, and tho&s;e called &s;tate-lords, with the nobility, who are im|mediately &s;ubject to the &s;overeign, and the repre|&s;entatives of the chief cities; but &s;ince the coun|try fell under the dominion of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, no fur&s;tentage or diets have been held. The king however, when he took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the country, confirmed all the other privileges of the inhabi|tants. With re&s;pect to religion, not only prote&s;tants, but papi&s;ts, Jews, and Greeks, enjoy full liberty of con&s;cience. The greate&s;t part of Sile&s;ia lies in the dioce&s;e of Bre&s;lau, but &s;ome part of it in the Poli&s;h dioce&s;es of Po&s;en and Cracow. The bi&s;hop of Bre&s;lau &s;tands immediately under the pope with regard to &s;pirituals, but all eccle&s;ia&s;tical benefices, not excepting the &s;ee of Bre&s;lau, is in the king's gift.

at Bre&s;lau is an univer&s;ity, and at Lignitz an academy for martial exerci&s;es. The principal ma|nufactures here are woollens, linens, and cottons of &s;everal &s;orts, with hats, gla&s;s-ware, gunpowder, and iron manufactures. Of the&s;e, and the manufac|tures of the country mentioned above, there is a con&s;iderable exportation. Accounts are generally kept in rix-dollars, &s;ilver gro&s;chens, and deuaren. With re&s;pect to its revolutions and pre&s;ent govern|ment, it was long a part of the kingdom of Poland; afterwards it had &s;everal dukes and petty princes for its &s;overeigns, who by degrees became &s;ubject to the kings of Bohemia, until, at la&s;t, king Charles IV. incorporated the whole duchy with Bohemia; and thus it continued in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, until the pre&s;ent king of Pru&s;&s;ia, taking advantage of the troubles that en&s;ued upon the death of the emperor Charles VI. and pretending a kind of claim, wre&s;ted a great part of it, together with the county of Glatz, from his daughter and heire&s;s, Maria There&s;a, the pre&s;ent empre&s;s dowa|ger; &s;o that now only a &s;mall part of it is po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and connected with the empire, the re&s;t being governed by the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, without acknowledging any &s;ort of de|pendence on the crown of Bohemia or the empire. For the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in all civil, cri|minal, and feudal ca&s;es, and &s;uch as relate to the revenue, the king of Pru&s;&s;ia has e&s;tabli&s;hed three &s;upreme judicatories, to which an appeal lies from all the inferior ones, and from which, when the &s;um exceeds five hundred rix-dollars, cau&s;es may be moved to Berlin. The Lutheran churches and &s;chools are under the in&s;pection of the upper-con|&s;i&s;tories, and tho&s;e of the papi&s;ts under that of the bi&s;hop's court at Bre&s;lau; but from both an ap|peal lies to the tribunal at Berlin. As to the re|venue, the exci&s;e here is levied only in the walled towns, being on the &s;ame footing as in the mark
<PB N="314" REF="3180">
of Brandenburg; but in the re&s;t of the country the contributions are fixed, and the &s;ame both in peace and war. The &s;everal branches of the revenue are under the management of the war and domain offices of Bre&s;lau and Glogau. The whole revenue ari&s;ing to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia from Sile&s;ia, and the county of Glatz, amounts to about four millions of rix-dollars per annum.</P>
<P>Sile&s;ia is divided into the Upper and Lower, and each of the&s;e again into principalities and lord&s;hips; of &s;ome of which, both the property and juri&s;dic|tion belong immediately to the &s;overeign, but of others to his &s;ubjects and va&s;&s;als. In regard to the character of the people, the boors are accounted very dull and &s;illy; but of tho&s;e of a higher rank, many have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their wit and learning, as well as by their military and poli|tical talents. However, in general, like their neighbours the Germans and Bohemians, they have more of Mars than Mercury in their compo&s;ition, and their parts are more &s;olid than &s;hining.

In|cluding the &s;uburbs, it is of great extent, having many large, regular &s;quares, broad &s;treets, &s;tately public and private edifices; but the fortifications are of no great importance. Here are in particu|lar a great many churches and convents belonging to the Catholics, of the former are al&s;o &s;everal belonging to the Lutherans, one to the Calvi|ni&s;ts, and one to the Greeks. The Jews have likewi&s;e two &s;ynagogues here, and the Je&s;uits a college; the bi&s;hop a &s;tately palace, and the Lutherans two gymna&s;iums. The popi&s;h uni|ver&s;ity is a noble &s;tructure, nor is the exchange de&s;titute of magnificence. This city is the &s;eat of all the high colleges, and the third in rank, next to Berlin and Konig&s;berg, in all the Pru&s;&s;ian domi|nions. The magi&s;tracy of it is Lutheran, and its trade and manufactures very con&s;iderable. Seve|ral of the mona&s;teries and nunneries are very mag|nificent; and there are al&s;o &s;ome good public libra|ries in it, with two armories, a college of phy&s;icians, and a mint.

It is al&s;o well watered by the Ney&s;z, and a number of le&s;&s;er &s;treams. Since it fell under the dominion of Pru&s;&s;ia, the landtage, or diets, have been di&s;continued. The language u&s;ually &s;poken is the German, and the principal manufactures are thread and linen; but the inha|bitants live chiefly by tillage and grazing. Till the king of Pru&s;&s;ia got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the county, popery alone was tolerated in it; but now the Lu|therans have the free exerci&s;e of their religion. From 1561, to 1742, this county continued an|nexed to the crown of Bohemia, when it was ceded to the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, his heirs and de&s;cendants, for ever, by the peace of Berlin. For the govern|ment of it, there is a regency at Glatz. From the tribunals, whether civil or eccle&s;ia&s;tical, an appeal lies to the courts at Bre&s;lau, and from them to the tribunal at Berlin.

<P>The lord&s;hip of A&s;ch is &s;urrounded by the prin|cipality of Culmbach, the Vogtland, and the king|dom of Bohemia. It belongs to baron Zedwitz, and, be&s;ides the market-town of A&s;ch, contains about twenty villages.</P>
<P>There are a great many lord&s;hips, market towns, and villages in the empire; that belong to the free nobility thereof, who are mo&s;tly counts and barons, and form a &s;ociety under certain regulations, and endowed with divers privileges, though they have no &s;eat in the diets of the empire and circles. They are divided into the circles of Swabia, Franconia, and the Rhine, and generally hold their e&s;tates im|mediately of the emperor and empire. In the time of a general war, or other pre&s;&s;ing exigency, in&s;tead of per&s;onal &s;ervice, to which they are bound, they contribute a &s;um of money to the emperor, but pay nothing to the chamber at Wetzlar. There is no place belonging to the nobility of the circles of Franconia and the Rhine worth mentioning, and the only place belonging to a member of the no|biliar circle of Swabia, that de&s;erves our notice, is

<HEAD>THE PRESENT STATE OF THE WORLD.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>HUNGARY, And its incorporated COUNTRIES.</HEAD>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>Its NAME, SITUATION, and DIVISION.</HEAD>
<P>THIS kingdom, or at lea&s;t the greate&s;t part of it, was antiently called Pannonia, from the Pannonians, who were de&s;cended of the Sclavi; but it took the name of Hungary from the Huns, a Scythian, or Tartar nation, who took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of it in the ninth century. It lies between the 18th and 22d degrees of ea&s;t long. and betwixt the 45th and 49th degrees of north lat. being bound|ed to the north by the Carpathian mountains, which &s;eparate it from Poland; to the &s;outh by Servia, and the river Drave, which &s;eparates it from Scla|vonia; to the we&s;t by Moravia, Au&s;tria, and Sti|ria; and to the ea&s;t by Walachia and Tran&s;ylvania. It is about two hundred and forty miles in length,
<PB N="336" REF="3400">
and two hundred and thirty-five in breadth, and it divided into the Upper and Lower Hungary, the former being that part which lies towards the ea&s;t, and the latter that which lies towards the we&s;t.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>AIR, SOIL, and PRODUCE.</HEAD>
<P>The northern parts of the kingdom are moun|tainous and barren, but healthy; the &s;outhern, on the contrary, are level, and exceeding fruitful, but not very healthy. The country along the Danube, from Pre&s;burg to Belgrade, for upwards of two hundred miles, is one continued plain, and no &s;oil can be more fertile; but the air, by rea&s;on of the many &s;wamps and mora&s;&s;es, is not &s;o whole&s;ome, as on the higher and drier grounds. Here are mines of gold, &s;ilver, copper, iron, lead, quick|&s;ilver, cinnabar, antimony, yellow orpiment, &s;ul|phur, vitriol, marca&s;ite, &s;alt native, and factitious, &s;altpetre, magnets, a&s;be&s;tos, or &s;tone-flax, marble of &s;everal colours, alaba&s;ter, with diamonds, and all &s;orts of precious &s;tones. Corn is in &s;uch plenty, that it is &s;old for one-&s;ixth of its price in England. Their grapes are large and lu&s;cious; and their wines, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of Tockay, preferred to any in Europe. They have va&s;t numbers of cattle and hor&s;es, the latter mo&s;tly mou&s;e coloured, with buffaloes, deer, wild fowl, game, and fi&s;h, and many &s;pecies of wild bea&s;ts, particularly chamois goats, bears, and lynxes. Of vegetables, be&s;ides vines, and the common &s;orts, here are tobacco, &s;affron, buck-wheat, millet, melons, and che&s;nuts. Here al&s;o are excellent warm baths, and &s;prings of various kinds and qualities. The chief mountains of Hungary are the Crapack, or Crapathian, which is the general name for all tho&s;e that &s;eparate this kingdom from Poland, Moravia, Sile&s;ia, and &s;ome part of Au&s;tria. The &s;ides of mo&s;t of them
<PB N="337" REF="3410">
are covered with wood, and their tops with &s;now. The chief rivers are the Danube, the Drave, the Save, the Wag or Waag, the Gran, the Temes, the Raab, and Thei&s;s, all well &s;tocked with fi&s;h; e&s;pecially the la&s;t, the carps of which have been &s;old for a crown the thou&s;and. There are &s;everal lakes among the Carpathian mountains, and &s;ome al&s;o in the lowlands.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>ORIGIN, CHARACTER, and MANNERS of the INHABITANTS.</HEAD>
<P>The inhabitants are a mixture of the de&s;cendants of the antient Huns, Sclavonians, Camani, Ger|mans, Walachians, Greeks, Jews, Turks, and a wandering people, called Zigduns, &s;aid to be of uncertain origin, but, probably, the &s;ame as tho&s;e we call gyp&s;ies. The Hungarians are &s;aid to be of a &s;anguine choleric temper, and &s;omewhat fierce, cruel, proud, and revengeful. They have been always reputed good &s;oldiers, being much more inclined to arms, martial exerci&s;es, and hunting, than to arts, learning, trade, or agriculture. The nobility affect great pomp and magnificence, and are much addicted to fea&s;ting and carou&s;ing. The men, in general, are &s;trong and well proportioned. They &s;have their beards, but leave whi&s;kers on the upper-lip; wearing fur caps on their heads, a clo&s;e-bodied coat, girt with a &s;a&s;h, with a &s;hort cloak, or mantle over all, &s;o contrived, as to be buckled under the arm, and leave the right hand at liberty. Their hor&s;e are called hu&s;&s;ars, and their foot heydukes. The former wear a broad|&s;word, or &s;cymeter, and carry a hatchet or battle|ax. Their hor&s;es are fleet, but not near &s;o large as the German hor&s;es, and therefore they &s;tand up on their &s;hort &s;tirrups, when they &s;trike. The heydukes u&s;ually wear feathers in their caps, ac|cording
<PB N="338" REF="3420">
to the number of the enemies they pretend to have killed. Both hor&s;e and foot are an excel|lent militia, very good at a pur&s;uit, or ravaging and plundering a country, but not equal to regu|lar troops in a pitched battle. The women, when they go abroad, wear &s;hort cloaks, and a veil.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>LANGUAGE, RELIGION, and SEMINARIES.</HEAD>
<P>There are four languages &s;poken in this country, viz the Hungarian, which, like the people, is of Scythian origin, and has little or no affinity with any European tongue; the German, Sclavonian, Wallachian, and Latin. The la&s;t is &s;poken not only by the better &s;ort, but al&s;o by the common people, though very corruptly. The people call|ed Zigduns have al&s;o a particular jargon. Chri&s;ti|anity was planted in Hungary in the ninth and tenth centuries. In the &s;ixteenth the reformation made a great progre&s;s in it; but at pre&s;ent, tho' the Roman catholics hardly make a fourth part of the inhabitants, their religion is predominant, the prote&s;tants enjoying only a bare toleration. Be|&s;ides &s;everal &s;ects of prote&s;tants, here are al&s;o great numbers of the Greek church and Jews; the la&s;t pay double taxes of all kinds. Be&s;ides Je&s;uits colleges and other convents, there are &s;everal uni|ver&s;ities for the Roman catholics. The Lutherans al&s;o and Calvini&s;ts have their gymna&s;iums and &s;chools, but under divers re&s;trictions.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>TRADE and MANUFACTURES.</HEAD>
<P>As to the traffic of this country, it is almo&s;t wholly in the hands of the Greeks and Jews. The exports con&s;i&s;t chiefly of wine, hor&s;es, cattle, metals, minerals, &s;affron, wool, and leather. Hungary, in particular, furni&s;hes Au&s;tria, and
<PB N="339" REF="3430">
other countries we&s;t of it, with va&s;t droves of cattle, as well as variety of excellent wines, of which tho&s;e of Tockay are reckoned the be&s;t. The prin|cipal manufactures are tho&s;e of copper, bra&s;s, iron, and other hard wares. Great quantities of bra&s;s and iron are exported, wrought and unwrought.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION and GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>Hungary at fir&s;t, like mo&s;t other countries, was divided into many little principalities and &s;tates, which at length were united under one head, who had the title of duke. The la&s;t of the&s;e dukes was Gey&s;a, who becoming a pro&s;elyte to Chri&s;tianity, was baptized; after which he re&s;igned the government to his &s;on Stephen, who took the title of king, anno 1000: but as the throne was filled by election, though generally out of the &s;ame family, the di&s;po&s;al of the crown was di&s;|puted between the Turki&s;h and German em|perors for near two hundred years; but after the year 1527, when Ferdinand, archduke of Au&s;tria, was advanced to the throne, the Au&s;trians found means to influence the elections in &s;uch a manner, as to keep the crown in their family till 1687, when it was &s;ettled hereditarily on their heirs male; and now, in con&s;equence of an act made by the diet at Pre&s;burg, in 1723, in ca&s;e of the failure of heirs male, it is to de&s;cend to females. The &s;tates of the kingdom con&s;i&s;t of the prelates, the barons, the gentry, and the royal towns. To the fir&s;t cla&s;s be|long two archbi&s;hops, about a dozen bi&s;hops, near as many abbots and provo&s;ts, with the Pauline &amp; Praemon&s;traten&s;ian Je&s;uits. To the &s;econd, the &s;tadtholder or palatine, who repre&s;ents the king, the court-judge, the ban or viceroy of Dalmatia, Croatia, and Sclavonia, the &s;tadtholder of Tran|&s;ilvania, the great trea&s;urer, the great cup-bearer,
<PB N="340" REF="3440">
the &s;teward of the hou&s;hold, the ma&s;ter of the hor&s;e, the lord-chamberlain, the captain of the yeomen of the guards, and the grand-mar&s;hal of the courts, who are &s;tiled the great barons, together with the inferior bans, or counts and barons. To the third cla&s;s belong the gentry, &s;ome of whom have noble manors, and others only the privileges of nobles. To the fourth cla&s;s belong the royal free cities, which are not &s;ubject to the counts, but hold immediately of the king. The gentry al&s;o, who hold of the archbi&s;hops and bi&s;hops, have the &s;ame privileges as the Hungarian nobility. The common people are va&s;&s;als to the lords, on who&s;e lands they live, whether the&s;e lands belong to the crown, the clergy, nobility, or gentry.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>REVENUE and FORCES.</HEAD>
<P>The ordinary revenue of this kingdom is &s;aid to exceed a million &s;terling, ari&s;ing from the mines, duties on cattle, royal deme&s;nes, &s;alt-works, con|tributions, cu&s;toms, &amp;c. The fortifications and garri&s;ons can&s;tantly maintained on the frontiers a|gain&s;t the Turks, are a great expence to the go|vernment. Hungary can ea&s;ily bring into the field one hundred thou&s;and men, regulars and militia; for there are fifty thou&s;and in actual pay, and the provinces furni&s;h the other fifty thou&s;and, when they are wanted.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>DIVISION and CHIEF TOWNS.</HEAD>
<P>Hungary, as we ob&s;erved above, is divided into Upper and Lower, which are &s;ubdivided each into two circles, and the&s;e again into counties, called by the natives Varmegye.</P>
<DIV4>
<PB N="341" REF="3450">
<HEAD>The principal places in LOWER-HUNGARY are,</HEAD>
<P>Pre&s;burg, the capital of the kingdom, called by the inhabitants Po&s;ony and Pre&s;poren, &s;itu|ated on the Danube, about forty-&s;ix miles ea&s;t from Vienna, and &s;eventy-five from Buda. The ca&s;tle, in which the regalia are kept, &s;tands on a hill above the town. Here the &s;tates a&s;&s;emble; and in the cathedral, dedicated to St. Martin, the king is crowned. The town is not very large, nor well built, but is very antient, and plea&s;antly &s;ituated, and enjoys a good air. Its fortifications are only a double wall and ditch. In the lower &s;uburbs is is a hill, where the king, after his coronation, goes on hor&s;eback, and brandi&s;hes St. Stephen's &s;word towards the four cardinal points, intimating, that he will defend his country again&s;t all its enemies. Be&s;ides the cathedral, there are &s;everal other popi&s;h and one Lutheran church, with a Je&s;uits college, three convents, and two ho&s;pitals. It gives name to a county, and is the re&s;idence of the archbi&s;hop of Gran, who is primate, chief &s;ecretary, and chan|cellor of the kingdom, legatus natus of the papal &s;ee, and prince of the Holy Roman empire.</P>
<P>Tirnau, a hand&s;ome royal town on the river Ti|na. Hither the archiepi&s;copal chapter of Gran was removed, when that city fell into the hands of the Turks, in 1543. There are a great many churches and convents in this town, be&s;ides an aca|demy of Je&s;uits.</P>
<P>Modra, a royal free-city, at the foot of the Car|pathian mountains, with vineyards on one &s;ide.</P>
<P>Bozin, a &s;mall but hand&s;ome royal-city on a ri&s;ing ground. Near it is a ca&s;tle belonging to count Palfy.</P>
<P>St. George, a &s;mall town, at the foot of a mountain, noted for the fine flavour of its wine.
<PB N="342" REF="3460">
The&s;e four towns are all in the county or pro|vince of Pre&s;burg, which lies on the north-&s;ide of the Danube, and is upwards of forty miles in length, and thirty in breadth. Count Palfy is hereditary|palatine of it. The crops in this county are often greatly damaged by mildew.</P>
<P>Nitra, a well peopled, but meanly built town, on a river of the &s;ame name. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who&s;e palace and cathedral are in the ca&s;tle that &s;tands above the town. The water here is &s;aid to be unwhol&s;ome. The town gives name to a pro|vince or county about forty-eight miles in length, and from eight to twenty-four in breadth, of which the bi&s;hop is palatine, and in which is &s;ome good corn land, with mineral &s;prings, warm baths, and vineyards.</P>
<P>Leopold&s;tadt, a &s;trong regular fortification on the Wag, and the only place in the county of Ni|tra capable of making head again&s;t an enemy.</P>
<P>Trent&s;chin, a royal free city on the Wag, and the capital of the county to which it gives name, and which extends along the Wag to the frontiers of Moravia and Sile&s;ia. Here is a ca&s;tle, &s;tanding on a &s;teep rock.</P>
<P>Welicona, the capital of the county of Arva, which lies between Sile&s;ia and the Carpathian mountains, and extends as far as Poland.</P>
<P>Lepto-Ujvar-Hradek, a ca&s;tle which gives name to a county every where full of mountains and rocks, higher than tho&s;e of the Alps; one in parti|cular, called Benikova, is three thou&s;and paces per|pendicular height. They abound in metals, mine|rals, and medicinal &s;prings, with caverns, in which are many curious figures in drop-&s;tone. The exhalations from &s;ome of the mineral &s;prings &s;uffocate birds in their flight over them. The chief towns in this county are Botza and Ro&s;enberg.</P>
<P><PB N="343" REF="3470">
Szent, a pretty large populous town, and the capital of the county of Thurotze, which is level and fertile, and contains &s;ome mineral &s;prings and baths.</P>
<P>Neu&s;ohl, the capital of the county of Alt&s;ohl, which is mountainous, and abounds in cattle and &s;heep, ores, minerals, medicinal &s;prings, and warm baths. At the village of Herrengrund are va&s;t copper-works; for out of the earth here oozes a vitriol by which iron is changed into copper. The effluvia of &s;ome of the warm &s;prings in the county kill both bea&s;ts and birds; yet the water may be drank, and the birds and bea&s;ts killed by the efflu|via &s;afely eaten.</P>
<P>Cremnitz, one of the chief of the mine-towns, and the capital of the county of Bars. It lies in a deep valley, betwixt high mountains, in which are many gold and other mines; but &s;o exhau&s;ted are tho&s;e of gold, that the ore got from them &s;carcely an&s;wers the expence of working them. There is a mint in the town for the coinage of gold ducats, &amp;c. to which all the other mine-towns bring their gold and &s;ilver. Both the air and water here are very unwhol&s;ome. Above the town is a ca&s;tle, with a church. There are many other towns in the county, of which tho&s;e of Skleno and Ei&s;enbach are famous for their hot baths.</P>
<P>Schemnitz, a pretty large town, and the capital of the county of Hont. Two-thirds of the in|habitants are prote&s;tants. This is the principal mine-town in Hungary; the gold and &s;ilver mines here &s;till producing a con&s;iderable quantity of ore, though far &s;hort of what they did formerly: a|bout a thou&s;and workmen are &s;till employed in the mines and mine-works. Mr. Key&s;ler &s;ays, the expence of working all the mines in Hungary is above a million of guilders. Here are two ca&s;tles. In the county are &s;everal warm baths and medi|cinal &s;prings, with load-&s;tone, iron, and lead ore;
<PB N="344" REF="3480">
but the air about the mines and mine-towns is ac|counted very unwhole&s;ome.</P>
<P>Neograd, a large village, giving name to a coun|ty which is mountainous and woody, but in &s;ome parts yields excellent wine, together with medicinal &s;prings, of which &s;ome are warm in winter, and cold in &s;ummer.</P>
<P>Pe&s;th, a royal free town, in a plain, on the Da|nube, over-again&s;t Buda, where the &s;upreme court of appeals is held. Here al&s;o is a large military ho&s;pital, with &s;everal churches and convents, and a bridge of boats of great length over the Da|nube. The town is &s;urrounded by a wall and moat, and gives name to a county, which is united to tho&s;e of Pilis and Solth, yields an excellent red and white wine, but is mo&s;tly mountainous, woody, and barren, and has little good water. Near it is a field in which many diets have been held, and kings cho&s;en.</P>
<P>Vaitz, a con&s;iderable city on the Danube, being the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and having a great annual fair, and bea&s;t-market, with &s;everal convents.</P>
<P>Buda, called Ofen-Buda by the inhabitants. There are two towns of this name, the Old and New Old Buda is but a poor mean place, but the New is a royal free town, &s;tanding on the Danube, &s;eventy-five miles from Pre&s;burg, and an hundred and &s;ix from Vienna. It is well fortified, and was the capital of the kingdom and re&s;idence of the king, until it was &s;eized by the Turks in 1529, in who&s;e hands it continued till 1689. Here is a ca&s;tle &s;ituated at the extremity of the town, on the ea&s;t &s;ide, commanding the greate&s;t part of it. Here al&s;o are &s;everal warm baths, of which &s;ome are &s;o moderate, that they are immediately fit either for bathing or drinking; but others are &s;o hot, that they cannot be u&s;ed until mixed with cold water, or conveyed to cool in other baths. The town has
<PB N="345" REF="3490">
con&s;iderable &s;uburbs. The neighbouring country yields a good red wine, and excellent melons. Hard by the town is the i&s;land of St. Andrew, in the Da|nube, eight miles long, and eight broad: and near it, on the banks of the river, is the town of St. Andrew, which makes a better figure than Buda it&s;elf. A few miles al&s;o below Buda is another i&s;land, called E&s;epel, which formerly belonged to prince Eugene, who had a &s;eat in the neighbour|hood, where he often re&s;ided. From the &s;ame prince a plea&s;ant mountain, that runs into the Da|nube and is covered with woods and vineyards, is called Eugene Promontory. The Danube here is a|bout a quarter of a league in breadth.</P>
<P>Coloe&s;a, the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, &s;tanding for|ty eight miles &s;outh-ea&s;t from Buda. The town was de&s;troyed by the Hungarian rebels in 1602, and afterwards by the Turks; but now begins to thrive again.</P>
<P>Szent-Miklos, the capital of the province of Lit|tle-Cumany, taking its name from the Cumani, who formerly dwelt betwixt the Nieper and the Black Sea; but being expelled by the Tartars, in 1237, went and &s;ettled in Hungary. Among other places in the county is Pandour, a village, from which tho&s;e well-known irregulars called Pandours take their name.</P>
<P>Batz, formerly an epi&s;copal city, but now, with its bi&s;hopric, united to Coloe&s;a. It gives name to a county in which, near the village of Zeuth on the Theis, prince Eugene, anno 1697, defeated the Turks, with great &s;laughter. The above places are in the circle, as it is called, beyond the Danube.</P>
<P>In the other, called the circle below the Danube, the principal places are,</P>

&s;outh-we&s;t from Pre&s;burg, is well built and popu|lous, and has large &s;uburbs. The neighbourhood is noted for good wine. Several diets have been held here; one in particular, anno 1601, in which the emperor Leopold granted the prote&s;tants the free exerci&s;e of their religion.</P>
<P>Wie&s;elburg, a large town, giving name to a county, in which is al&s;o Altenburg or O-Var, a beautiful town on a branch of the Danube, with Gabo, Kop&s;in, and Neu&s;iedel, con&s;iderable towns. The la&s;t gives name to a lake twenty miles long, and nine broad.</P>
<P>Raab, a town &s;trongly fortified, at the conflux of the Danube, Raab, and Rabnitz. It is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, and has an univer&s;ity, with a &s;trong garri|&s;on. In the county to which it gives name, is the chief Benedictine abbey in Hungary, &s;ituate on a hill, called Martin's-berg, from the &s;aint to which the convent is dedicated.</P>
<P>Comorra, a royal free town, at the conflux of the Danube and Wag, near which is a very &s;trong for|tre&s;s, and a large i&s;land in the Danube, called Schul. It gives name to a county, in which are quarries of white and red marble, and &s;ome other con&s;iderable towns, be&s;ides the remains of the old town of Bre|getium, where many curious antiquities have been found.</P>
<P>Gran, a royal free town on the Danube, where it is joined by the river Gran, thirty-five miles from Pre&s;burg, and ninety-two from Vienna. Here are &s;ome natural warm baths. When this city was be|&s;ieged by the Imperiali&s;ts, in 1596, Sir Thomas Arundel, of Wardour ca&s;tle, di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf in &s;uch a manner, that the emperor Rodolph created him a count of the empire, and king James I. made him a baron of England, which honours are &s;till enjoyed by his po&s;terity. The neighbouring country is very plea&s;ant and fruitful, and yields

<HEAD>In UPPER-HUNGARY, which lies towards the ea&s;t, on the borders of Poland, Tran&s;ilvania, and Wa|lachia, the principal places are,</HEAD>
<P>Skepus, a ca&s;tle, which gives name to a county of great extent, abounding in &s;ome parts with fruit|ful corn fields, rich pa&s;tures, pul&s;e, and flax, and in others with woods and mountains, &s;ome of which are among the loftie&s;t of the Carpathian chain. No wine is made in any part of it, but it has &s;ome iron and copper mines. Near the ca&s;tle of Ske|pus is a cavern, in which all the winter the water is fluid, but in &s;ummer large quantities of ice is brought from it for cooling their liquors. The principal towns in the county, be&s;ides the mine|towns, are Leut&s;chau, Ka&s;mark, and Lublyo. The two fir&s;t are walled. Vitriol, or copperas, not only gu&s;hes out from the mines of this county, but breaks forth al&s;o from the &s;urface of the ground.

<HEAD>TRANSYLVANIA.</HEAD>
<P>THIS country, a part of the antient Dacia, had its modern name from its &s;ituation, trans &s;ylvas, i. e. beyond the woods or fore&s;ts, which divide it from Hungary. The Germans call it Sie|benburgen, from &s;even celebrated ca&s;tles in it; and the Hungarians Erdely, which &s;ignifies a woody, mountainous country. It is &s;aid to be about an hundred and &s;ixty miles from north to &s;outh, and an hundred and fifty from ea&s;t to we&s;t, being bounded on the north by Hungary, Poland, and Moldavia, on the &s;outh by Walachia and the Ban|nat of Teme&s;var, on the ea&s;t by Moldavia, and on the we&s;t by Hungary. Its mountains yield gold, &s;ilver, iron, lead, copper, quick&s;ilver, rock-&s;alt, cinnabar, &s;ulphur, vitriol, &s;alt-petre, antimony, red ochre, i&s;ingla&s;s, and other minerals, and &s;everal of them are clothed with vines. Many petrifying, &s;alt, and medicinal &s;prings, cold and hot, with a great variety of plants, are al&s;o found among them. The fields and vallies are rich and fertile, yielding corn, pul&s;e, and fruits, and the fore&s;ts abound with buffaloes, elks, &s;tags, wild-goats, bears, fox|es, martins, lynxes, ermines, beavers, wild-a&s;&s;es, wolves, bees, &amp;c. Va&s;t numbers al&s;o of black cattle and hor&s;es are bred here. Of the latter there is a wild &s;ort, with manes hanging down to the ground. The principal rivers are the Szamos, the Maros, and the Aluta. As to the inhabitants, they are of &s;everal &s;orts, as Hungarians, Saxons, Walachians, Armenians, Bulgarians, Greeks, Ra&s;cians or Ser|vians, and a people of Tartar origin, called Sekli. Here are al&s;o Jews and Zigduns, or gyp&s;ies, as in Hungary. In regard to religion, Roman catholics, prote&s;tants, Greeks, and Armenians, are all tolerated
<PB N="354" REF="3580">
here. The prote&s;tants are much more numerous than the Roman catholics. For a long time this country was chiefly governed by waywodes, &s;et up and &s;upported &s;ometimes by the Turks, and &s;ometimes by the emperors of Germany. In 1713 Michael Apaffi, the la&s;t of the&s;e waywodes, dying without i&s;&s;ue, Tran&s;ylvania was annexed to Hun|gary, without regard to the claims of the Rakotzi family; and, &s;ince 1722, hath been made hereditary to the princes and prince&s;&s;es of the hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria, whereas before the prince &s;ucceeded by free election. The &s;tates, like tho&s;e of Hungary, con|&s;i&s;t of the prelates or clergy, nobility, gentry, and royal towns: but each of the three nations, i. e. the Hungarians, Sikli or Sekli, and Saxons, have not only their &s;eparate di&s;tricts, but differ widely in re&s;pect of their internal government, laws, cu&s;|toms, and con&s;titutions: all, however, are &s;ub|ordinate to the prince and diet. The executive power is chiefly in the governor, and the council, appointed by the empre&s;s-queen out of the three nations above mentioned; for the others have no &s;hare in the government, nor &s;uch as are not of the Roman catholic, Calvini&s;t, or Lutheran reli|gions. The military e&s;tabli&s;hment of Tran&s;ylva|nia con&s;i&s;ts, at pre&s;ent, only of &s;ix regiments, un|der a commander in chief. The empre&s;s-queen draws a con&s;iderable revenue from it. In 1733 it paid no le&s;s than &s;eventy thou&s;and pounds to the extraordinary &s;ub&s;idy demanded by the emperor, which was double the &s;um paid by Stiria. The chief tribunal is that called the royal table, to which appeals lie from the inferior courts, and from it to the governor and council, and from thence to the &s;overeign. In church affairs, ap|peals lie from the bi&s;hop to the archbi&s;hop of Co|lotza, the pope's nuncio, and the court of Rome.</P>

<HEAD>SCLAVONIA.</HEAD>
<P>THE country antiently comprehended under this name, extended from the Adriatic to the Black Sea, the Sclavi having over-run all the&s;e pro|vinces; and, to this day, the languages &s;poken in them are all dialects or corruptions of the Sclavonic. Modern Sclavonia has the Drave on the north, and the Save on the &s;outh, terminating ea&s;tward on the Danube, and we&s;tward on Carniola, and extending about three hundred miles from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and &s;eventy from north to &s;outh, where broade&s;t. It takes its name from the Sclavi, a Scythian nation, who, about the time of the emperor Ju&s;tinian, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of this and the neighbouring countries. The inhabitants are a mixture of Scla|vonians, Croats, Walachians, Germans, Venetians, Turks, Servians or Ra&s;cians, and Hungarians. Sclavonia was long &s;ubject to the Venetians, after|wards to the Turks, by whom the greate&s;t part of it was ceded to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, at the treaty of Carlowitz. In 1746 it was united to Hungary by the empre&s;s-queen. The &s;tates &s;end repre&s;entatives to the diets of Hungary, and have al&s;o diets of
<PB N="357" REF="3610">
their own. A viceroy, or ban, pre&s;ides over Sclavonia, jointly with Croatia and part of Dalma|tia. Some &s;ay that the word &s;lave took its ri&s;e from the tyranny exerci&s;ed by the Venetians to|wards the people of this country, when under their dominion. The air is plea&s;ant and temperate, the face of the country level, and the &s;oil fruitful in corn, wine, and pa&s;ture. The only religion pub|licly tolerated, is the Roman catholic; yet there are many of the Greek church. To the extraor|dinary &s;ub&s;idies granted to the emperor it pays as much as Tyrol, viz. ten thou&s;and pounds. The places of mo&s;t note in it are,</P>
<P>E&s;&s;ek, a con&s;iderable town on the river Drave, near its influx into the Danube, eighty-&s;even miles north-we&s;t from Belgrade, and an hundred and three &s;outh-ea&s;t from Buda. It was particular|ly remarkable once for a wooden bridge, erected by the Turks over the Danube and &s;ome mora&s;&s;es, which was near eight miles in length, and thirty yards in breadth, with rails on each &s;ide, watch|towers at every quarter of a mile's di&s;tance, and &s;tairs leading down to the mar&s;hes; but this bridge was de&s;troyed by the Imperiali&s;ts in their late wars with the Turks, who u&s;ed to invade Hungary by it.</P>
<P>Zalankemen, a walled town, with a ca&s;tle, op|po&s;ite to which the Theis falls into the Danube.</P>
<P>Peterwardein, a &s;trong town on the Danube, op|po&s;ite to Belgrade. In its neighbourhood prince Eugene obtained a great victory over the Turks in 1716.</P>
<P>Carlowitz, on the banks of the Danube, &s;ix miles north-we&s;t of Peterwardein, and thirty-four of Belgrade. It is noted for a treaty of peace con|cluded here, in 1698, betwixt the emperor, the czar of Mu&s;covy, the king of Poland, and the Vene|tians, on the one part, and the Turks on the
<PB N="358" REF="3620">
other. Here the Greek bi&s;hop of Sclavonia re&s;ides, and the neighbourhood is noted for good red wine.</P>
<P>Mitrowitz, a town on the Save, where antiently &s;tood Sirmium, the capital of Illyricum.</P>

It is about eighty miles in length, and &s;eventy in breadth, and was once di|vided between the Hungarians and Turks, but now the greate&s;t part of it is &s;ubject to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria. The Croats derive their origin from the Sclavi, and their language is a dialect of the Scla|vonian, approaching very near to that of the Poles. The country is divided into two parts, viz. that under, and that beyond the Save. In the late wars between the empre&s;s queen and the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, it is &s;aid that no le&s;s than fifty thou&s;and men were rai&s;ed in this country, and twenty thou&s;and in Scla|vonia. Both hor&s;e and foot are good &s;oldiers, e&s;|pecially the former, &s;erving for much the &s;ame purpo&s;es as the hu&s;&s;ars, pandours, and other ir|regulars. The &s;oil, where cultivated, is fruitful in wine and oil, and many other products; but be|ing

a frontier country, and much expo&s;ed to in|roads, it is not &s;o well cultivated as it otherwi&s;e would be, which is al&s;o the ca&s;e with Sclavonia. Here is one bi&s;hopric, but no univer&s;ities, and the only towns worth mentioning are,</P>

The Au&s;trians, Turks, and Ragu&s;ans, &s;hare the re&s;t of it among&s;t them. The language and cu&s;toms of the inhabitants are Sclavonian, and their religion the Roman catholic. The mountains are covered with olives, vines, and myrtles, or flocks of &s;heep, and lined with gold and &s;ilver ore. The plains are fertile, and feed abundance of cattle. Under Dalmatia is included Morlachia, a country full of high mountains, in length about &s;ixty miles, and in breadth eighty, being a part of the antient Liburnia. The inha|bitants are of Walachian extraction; for the name
<PB N="360" REF="3640">
of the country is a contraction of Mauro-Walachia, that is, Black Walachia; and the Walachians, it is &s;aid, are the de&s;cendants of the Roman colonies that were antiently planted in the&s;e countries. There is a people in this country and Carniola, called U&s;|cocks, a rough &s;avage race, much addicted to ra|pine, and noted for their agility, &s;kipping like goats among the mountains, from rock to rock. Their language is Walachian, and their religion the Greek, or &s;omething like it. The principal places belonging to the Au&s;trians in Dalmatia are,</P>

<HEAD>RAGUSA and its TERRITORY.</HEAD>
<P>RAGUSA is a &s;mall republic, which, in its con&s;titution, much re&s;embles Venice, the government being almo&s;t entirely in the hands of the nobles. The chief magi&s;trate is &s;tiled rector, an&s;wering to the Venetian doge, except that he is changed every month. Here al&s;o are &s;everal coun|cils, of which that of the pregadi has the chief direction of affairs. To guard the city again&s;t contagious di&s;tempers here is a board of health, con&s;i&s;ting of five nobles. It is &s;aid of the Ragu|&s;ans, that they pay tribute to the Turks out of fear, to the Venetians out of hatred, and to the emperor, Spain, the pope, and Naples, out of re|&s;pect, and from political views. They are &s;o jealous of their neighbours, that the gates of the city are allowed to be open only a few hours in the day. Their chief protector is the grand &s;eignior, to whom they pay an annual tribute of twenty thou|&s;and zequins. The languages &s;poken here are the Italian and Sclavonian. The e&s;tabli&s;hed religion is the Roman catholic; but tho&s;e of the Turks, Greeks, and Armenians are tolerated. The only place of any note in their territory is that from which the republic takes its name, which was antiently called Epidaurus. At pre&s;ent it is a &s;mall, but well built town, &s;tanding on the &s;ea|coa&s;t, in a whole&s;ome air, but barren &s;oil, and hav|ing a good harbour, with &s;everal manufactures, and a con&s;iderable trade. It is al&s;o the &s;ee of an archbi&s;hop, and &s;ome &s;mall fertile i&s;lands in the Adriatic belong to it.</P>
<P>In Turki&s;h Dalmatia are &s;everal con&s;iderable towns, viz. Scardona, Kliuno, Herzegowina, Ma|&s;ter, Medon, and Ale&s;&s;io, antiently Li&s;&s;us or Li&s;|&s;um,

mountains, who&s;e tops are &s;aid to be from nine to twelve thou&s;and feet above the level of the &s;ea, con&s;i&s;ting of craggy inacce&s;&s;ible rocks, of which &s;ome are quite bare, while others are always covered with ice and &s;now. Among the mountains are many excellent medicinal and other &s;prings, cold and warm baths, water-falls, craggy precipices, deep narrow vallies, and ca|verns. They yield al&s;o a great variety of herbs, thickets, and bu&s;hes, in the upper parts; and, in the lower, rich pa&s;tures and woods. The highe&s;t are tho&s;e in the canton of Uri. Many of the vallies are covered with lakes, or watered by brooks and rivers. In &s;ome of them are towns, villages, woods, vineyards, and corn lands. Both on the moun|tains, and in the vallies, the air is extremely cold in winter; but in &s;ummer it is very plea&s;ant, cool, and refre&s;hing on the former, but exce&s;&s;ive hot in the latter. Sometimes it is winter on the north|&s;ide of a mountain, when it is &s;ummer on the other; nay flowers may be gathered &s;ometimes with one hand, and &s;now with the other. Prodigious ma&s;&s;es of ice and &s;now often fall from them in winter, and do a great deal of damage; and mo&s;t of the &s;treams and rivers take their ri&s;e from the thawing of the ice and &s;now on their &s;ides and tops. From the ri&s;ing or de&s;cending of the clouds, with which they are commonly enveloped, the inhabitants can, for the mo&s;t part, pretty exactly foretel the changes of the weather, &s;o that they &s;erve them in&s;tead of weather gla&s;&s;es. The other and lower parts of Switzerland are very plea&s;ant and fertile, being diver&s;ified with vineyards, corn-fields, meadows, and pa&s;ture-grounds. The mountains in the&s;e are but mole-hills in compari&s;on of the others: there is neither &s;now nor ice on them in &s;ummer, and they frequently afford not only good pa&s;turage, but arable ground.

The &s;ands of the rivers yield gold-du&s;t, particularly tho&s;e of the Rhine, the Emmet, the Aare, the Reu&s;z, the Adda, and the Goldbach. The metals of this country being generally found to be brittle, the only mines that are worked are a few iron ones. In the lower parts of Switzerland they &s;ow rye, oats, barley, &s;pelt, flax, and hemp. Wines of various &s;orts are al&s;o produced in &s;ome of them, with apples, pears, nuts, cherries, plumbs, and che&s;nuts; and tho&s;e that lie towards Italy abound in peaches, morels, almonds, figs, citrons, and pomegranates. Of wood for fuel, and other u&s;es, there is generally plenty; in &s;ome places, however, they are obliged to burn &s;heeps dung, and in others a kind of heath and &s;mall &s;hrubs. In the vallies, they cultivate &s;affron with good &s;ucce&s;s. The Switzers derive their princi|pal &s;ub&s;i&s;tence from their flocks and herds of cattle, which in &s;ummer graze upon the mountains. Their chee&s;e is much e&s;teemed, e&s;pecially that of Bern and Griers, in the canton of Freyburg. Great numbers of hor&s;es al&s;o are bred here, and bought up for the French cavalry. Chamois goats are common on the mountains and al&s;o marmou&s;ets, which in Latin are called mures alpini, i. e. Alpine mice, but in reality are a kind of badgers. There are wild fowls of &s;everal &s;orts, particularly a large kind of eagle. The foxes are white or yellow; and of the hares &s;ome turn white in winter, &s;o that they can &s;carce be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the &s;now. Be|&s;ides the abovementioned rivers, the Rhone and the Te&s;in have their &s;ources in this country. The lakes are very numerous; but the chief are tho&s;e of
<PB N="368" REF="3720">
Geneva, Neufchattel, Biel, Zurich, Thun, Brien, Con&s;tance, and Lucern. Both rivers and lakes abound with fi&s;h, and afford a cheap water-car|riage. Switzerland is not &s;o populous as many other countries in Europe; and the popi&s;h cantons le&s;s &s;o than the prote&s;tant. The total number of the inhabitants is computed at two millions.</P>

<HEAD>LANGUAGE, RELIGION, and LEARNING.</HEAD>
<P>The language generally &s;poken here is the Ger|man, in which al&s;o all public affairs are tran&s;acted; but in tho&s;e parts of the country that border on Italy or France, a corrupt French or Italian pre|vails. The two predominant religions are Cal|vini&s;m and popery. Of the former are the cantons of Zurich and Bern, the towns of St. Gall, Ge|neva, Muhlhau&s;en, and Biel, the principality of Neufchatel, the greater part of Ba&s;il, Schaff|hau&s;en, the country of the Gri&s;ons, the Thurgau, Toggenburg, Glaris, and the Rhine valley, the fron|tiers of Appenzel, with a &s;mall part of Solothurn, and &s;ome places in the countries of Baden and Sar|gans. The re&s;t of the Swi&s;s cantons, allies, and dependants are popi&s;h. For the education of youth there is an univer&s;ity at Ba&s;il, and aca|demies at Zurich, Bern, Lau&s;anne, and Geneva, be&s;ides gymna&s;iums and &s;cholae illu&s;tres, both in the popi&s;h and Swi&s;s cantons. There are al&s;o &s;o|cieties among them for the improvement of the German language, and the &s;ciences. Some Swit|zers have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in the fine arts, e&s;pecially in painting and engraving; but there are but few of them that have been remarkable for their exten&s;ive learning and deep erudition, or their fine ta&s;te for polite literature.</P>

<PB N="369" REF="3730">
<HEAD>MANUFACTURES and TRADE.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to manufactures, the principal are &s;nuff and tobacco, linen of &s;everal &s;orts, lace, thread, &s;ilk and wor&s;ted &s;tockings, neckcloths, cotton &s;tuffs, gloves, handkerchiefs, &s;ilks of &s;everal &s;orts, gold and &s;ilver brocades, a variety of woollen manu|factures, hats, paper, leather of all &s;orts, earthern wares, porcelain, toys, watches, clocks, and other hardwares, &amp;c. The trade of Switzerland is greatly promoted by many navigable lakes and rivers. In &s;ome of the above manufactures, and in chee&s;e, butter, &s;heep, hor&s;es, black cattle, hides and &s;kins, the exports are con&s;iderable; and as the imports are chiefly grain and &s;alt, with &s;ome American and A&s;iatic goods, there is probably a large balance in their favour. In &s;ome parts of Switzerland dre&s;s is re&s;trained by &s;umptuary laws.</P>

<HEAD>REVOLUTIONS and CONSTITUTION.</HEAD>
<P>The Swi&s;s were antiently called Helvitii. After they were defeated by Marius they retired into their own country, where they lived peaceably till the time of Julius Cae&s;ar, who obliged them again to &s;ubmit to the Roman yoke, under which they con|tinued till the declen&s;ion of that empire, when they became a part of the kingdom of Burgundy. After that they fell under the dominion of the Franks; then of the Germans; but being op|pre&s;&s;ed by the latter, they threw off the yoke, and erected &s;everal &s;tates or republics, which, at the treaty of We&s;tphalia in 1648, were recognized as free and independent. The cantons of Switz, Uri, and Underwald, having, &s;o early as the year 1308, entered into a confederacy in the canton of Switz, and having al&s;o obtained their fir&s;t victory
<PB N="370" REF="3740">
in 1315, over Leopold, archduke of Au&s;tria, in the &s;ame canton, its name was given to the whole con|federacy, which it &s;till retains. The other can|tons &s;ucce&s;&s;ively acceded to this a&s;&s;ociation, but &s;ome of them not until upwards of an hundred years after. With re&s;pect to the government and con|&s;titution of the&s;e cantons, &s;ome of them are ari&s;|tocracies, and &s;ome democracies. In the former both the legi&s;lative and executive power is lodged in the burghers or citizens of the capital of each canton; and of the&s;e there are &s;even, viz. Zurich, Bern, Ba&s;il, Friburg, Solothurn, and Schaff hau&s;en. In the others the legi&s;lative power is lodged in the whole body of the people; and every male above &s;ixteen, whether ma&s;ter or &s;ervant, has a vote in making laws, and in the choice of magi&s;trates. For what concerns the whole Helvetic body, there are diets ordinary and extraordinary: the former are held annually and the others upon particular emergen|cies; and both are &s;ummoned by the city of Zurich, which appoints the time and place of their meetings. Be&s;ides the general diets, &s;ince the reformation, there have been particular diets of the two religions, at which all public affairs of con&s;equence, that regard the two parties, are treated &s;eparate|ly; for tho' a &s;en&s;e of their common intere&s;ts obliges them to &s;tudy to maintain the league and union, yet it is certain, that the mutual confidence between the cantons is in &s;ome mea&s;ure lo&s;t, through the zeal of each party for their particular opinions, e&s;pecially of the Roman catholics. The annual general diets are held always at Frauenfeld, or Baden, principally to regulate the affairs of the common bailiages. Lucern takes the lead of the Roman catholic cantons, being the mo&s;t powerful of that deno|mination; but Zurich, though le&s;s powerful than that of Bern, takes the precedence of all the other cantons, both prote&s;tant and popi&s;h. The&s;e can|tons
<PB N="371" REF="3750">
do not make one commonwealth, but are &s;o many independent &s;tates, united together by &s;trict alliances for their mutual defence. The extraordinary diets or congre&s;&s;es are held at Al|dorf. Each canton u&s;ually deputes two envoys, both to the ordinary and extraordinary; to which al&s;o the abbot and town of St. Gall, and the town of Biel, &s;end repre&s;entatives as allies. To the thirteen cantons belong, in common, twenty-one bailiages, two towns, and two lord&s;hips. The allies or incorporated places, as they are call|ed, are the abbot and town of St. Gall, the three Gri&s;on Leagues, the republic of the Valais, the towns of Muhlhau&s;en and Biel, the principality of Neuenberg or Neufchatel, Geneva, and the bi&s;hop of Ba&s;il. Of the&s;e the abbot and town of St. Gall, and the town of Biel, are regarded as members of the Helvetic body, but the re&s;t only as allies.</P>

<HEAD>REVENUES.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to the public revenues, they are in general very incon&s;iderable, ari&s;ing chiefly from the u&s;ual regalia, appropriated every where to the &s;overeign, the deme&s;nes, and public granaries, vo|luntary contributions, the &s;ale of &s;alt, and a land|tax; in the prote&s;tant cantons from the church|lands al&s;o that were &s;eized at the reformation. Ex|cept in Zurich, Bern, Ba&s;il, and Schaffhau&s;en, where the people are more indu&s;trious, have a greater trade, and are richer than in the others, they defray the ordinary charges, and that is all.</P>

<PB N="372" REF="3760">
Every male from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty is enrolled, and about one third of them regimented. They mu&s;t all provide them&s;elves with arms, cloathing, and accoutrements, and appear on the &s;tated days for exerci&s;e; and the &s;everal cantons and di&s;tricts mu&s;t be furni&s;hed with a &s;ufficient train of artillery, and all the other implements of war. The Switzers of the &s;everal cantons are allowed to engage in the &s;ervice of &s;uch foreign princes and &s;tates as are in alliance with tho&s;e cantons, or with whom they have made a previous agreement. Such &s;tates, paying an annual &s;ub&s;idy to the re&s;pective cantons, are al|lowed to make levies. Every man enli&s;ts voluntari|ly, and for what number of years they plea&s;e; at the expiration of which they are at liberty to return home. A great many thus always returning from foreign &s;ervice, Switzerland is never unprovided with able and experienced officers and &s;oldiers. With re&s;pect to their character, they are a brave, hone&s;t, ho&s;pitable, hardy people; very true to their engagements, friendly, and humane. In &s;hort, there is not a people in Europe who&s;e national character is better. In their per&s;ons they are generally tall, robu&s;t, and well made, but their com|plexions are none of the be&s;t, and tho&s;e that live in the neighbourhood of the mountains are &s;ubject to wens. The women are &s;aid to be generally hand|&s;ome and well &s;haped, &s;en&s;ible and mode&s;t, yet frank, ea&s;y, and agreeable in conver&s;ation. Few of the pea&s;ants are mi&s;erably poor, and many of them rich, e&s;pecially in the prote&s;tant cantons, and that of Bern in particular. We now proceed to a particular de&s;cription of the &s;everal cantons, accord|ing to their rank, after which will follow that of their common bailiages and incorporated territories.</P>

<P>This canton is bounded to the north by Swabia and the canton of Schaff hau&s;en, to the &s;outh by the town and territory of Rapper&s;chweil and the cantons of Switz and Zug, to the ea&s;t by the Thur|gau, Toggenburg, and Utznach, and to the we&s;t by the free bailiages and county of Baden. It is about &s;ixty miles from north to &s;outh, and forty-eight from ea&s;t to we&s;t. This canton, with re&s;pect to its face, air, and &s;oil, is &s;aid to be an epitome of all Switzerland, as containing in it hills, vallies, plains, corn-lands, vineyards, lakes, and rivers. Their wines have a tartne&s;s at fir&s;t, but the longer they are kept the more agreeable they are. The other products are excellent fruits, corn, pa&s;ture, fine clay, chalk, &s;everal coloured earths, pit-coal, turf, and &s;ulphur. There are al&s;o &s;ome mineral &s;prings in the canton, and of the lakes that of Zurich is the mo&s;t con&s;ide|rable. The reformation was introduced here by Zwinglius, in the year 1517. Religious matters are under the direction of an eccle&s;ia&s;tical council, and a &s;ynod. There are an hundred and fifty mini&s;ters in the canton, divided into ten deanries. It is the fir&s;t in rank, and inferior only to that of Bern in extent, power, and wealth; in con&s;e|quence of which, its repre&s;entatives pre&s;ide in the general diets, when held in any place belonging in common to the cantons, and the affairs relating to the whole confederacy are tran&s;acted in its offices. Its quota, for the defence of the &s;everal members of the confederacy, is fourteen hundred men. Of one of the two armies rai&s;ed on the&s;e occa&s;ions, it nominates one of the commanders in chief, as Lu|cern does the other. Its revenue is &s;aid to be about an hundred and fifty thou&s;and crowns a-year, of which, one year with another, two-thirds are expend|ed
<PB N="374" REF="3780">
in the charges of government, and the re&s;t laid up in the trea&s;ury. It can bring fifty thou&s;and fighting men into the field, at a very &s;hort warning. Of the bailiwics into which it is divided, eighteen are called the inward, and eighteen the outward. Over each of the former there are two bailiffs, who hold their employments during life, officiate by turns, and re&s;ide in the city, vi&s;iting their baili|wics only at certain times, for the holding of courts. In the latter the bailiffs re&s;ide con&s;tantly, and hold their office only for &s;ix, nine, or at mo&s;t twelve years. Here are al&s;o twenty &s;ecularized convents that are called bailiages, but without any juri&s;diction annexed to them. The principal places in the canton are,</P>
<P>Zurich, which gives name to it, and is its capi|tal, &s;tanding in a plea&s;ant country, near where the river Aa i&s;&s;ues from the lake that takes its name from the town, twenty-three miles from Schaff|hau&s;en, and an hundred and fourteen from Geneva. After having been ruined by Attila, the Hun, it is &s;aid to have been re&s;tored by Thuricus, &s;on of The|odoric, king of the Goths, from whom it took the name of Thuricum, corrupted afterwards into that of Zurich. The river divides it into two parts, and has two bridges over it. It is fortified in the mo|dern way, and has wide ditches, faced with free &s;tone. There are five ar&s;enals in it, well &s;tored with arms and artillery; an academy or college, having fifteen profe&s;&s;ors; a mu&s;eum, or chamber of rarities; a &s;tately town-hou&s;e, the pillars in the front of which are of black marble, &s;treaked with white; and a town-library. The Platz and Lindenhof are two plea&s;ant walks, planted with lime-trees. The &s;overeignty and admini&s;tration of all affairs are lodged in the greater and le&s;&s;er council, out of which are cho&s;en the city-officers, as the councils are out of the thirteen companies of
<PB N="375" REF="3790">
burghers. There are &s;everal other councils or col|leges, each of which has its particular department. Here are a great variety of &s;ilk, woollen, linen, cot|ton, and other manufactures, this being the place of the greate&s;t trade in all Switzerland. Before the reformation, there was an abbey for ladies in this town, who&s;e abbe&s;s had the title of prince&s;s; the large revenues of which are now applied mo&s;tly to pious and charitable u&s;es. The town is well &s;upplied with provi&s;ions by and from its lake. The &s;treets are neat, and hou&s;es well built, but not magnificent. The college here hath produced &s;ome learned men, particularly Zwinglius and Bullinger. In the town|library are &s;everal letters to Bullinger, from lady Jane Gray, daughter to the duke of Suffolk. In one of the ar&s;enals is the figure of William Tell, dre&s;&s;ed and armed in the antient Swi&s;s manner, with the cro&s;s-bow, whence he &s;hot the arrow that &s;truck the apple off of his child's head. The unmarried women here are di&s;tingui&s;hed from the married, by a particular knot of ribbons on their heads, and the men are generally dre&s;&s;ed in black; for the young only are allowed to wear coloured &s;tuffs, and tho&s;e quite plain, gold, &s;ilver, and jewels, being forbid, and luxury and vanity, of every kind, carefully guarded again&s;t. When they go to church, the men all wear bands, and, when in mourning, bonnets made of pa&s;teboard, covered with crape. Both men and women are &s;o fond of mu&s;ic, that there is few of them that cannot play on &s;ome in&s;trument. If a burgher goes out of town, or a pea&s;ant enters it, without a &s;word, they are liable to be fined. No per&s;ons, whatever their rank or office may be, are exempted from the &s;umptuary laws. The burgoma&s;ters, who are the &s;ame as the advoyers at Bern, have the title of ex|cellence. The ho&s;pitals here are very neat, and well endowed; but they do not affect the ridicu|lous
<PB N="376" REF="3800">
vanity of lodging the poor in palaces. Not only in this town and canton, and other parts of Switzerland, but al&s;o among the Gri&s;ons, the mi|ni&s;ters all preach covered. The country about the town is very plea&s;ant and fruitful, for both which it is not a little indebted to the lake, that extends twenty-four miles in length, and about two or three in breadth. The water is of a green colour, &s;uppo&s;ed to be owing to the melted &s;now that falls into it from the adjacent mountains. That part of it next Zurich, is called the Lower-lake, and the other end, the Upper. The cathedral, or great church here, is collegiate. Among the archives of the dean and chapter are many folios of letters, to and from Bullenger, relating to the Reforma|tion. The pre&s;ent city is &s;aid to owe its origin to a nunnery, founded by the emperor Lewis I. near where the antient Tigurum &s;tood. At the village of Waugen near it is a &s;pring, called Hunger|brunn, which is &s;aid to flow plentifully before a &s;carcity, though dry at all other times.</P>

<P>Lauffen, a village on the Rhine, about a league below Schaffhau&s;en, where the river precipitates it&s;elf from rocks an hundred and twenty feet in height. Goods therefore that are brought down the Rhine, are taken out above Lauffen, and em|barked again below it.</P>

<P>Gruningen, a &s;mall town, but the capital of a bailiwic. Here is a fine ca&s;tle, in which the bai|liff re&s;ides, and the church has &s;everal beautiful tombs in it. At the village of Babiken, in this bailiwic, is a hou&s;e of the Teutonic order.</P>
<P>Lower-Lunneren, a &s;mall village, in the baili|wic of Knonau, where, in 1741, many curious re|mains of Roman antiquities were found. In the &s;ame bailiwic, Albis, a very lofty mountain, has its beginning, who&s;e &s;ides are covered with woods, and on who&s;e top are two watch-towers.</P>
<P>Stein-am-Rhein, a town on the Celler-Lake, where the Rhine i&s;&s;ues from it.

<P>This canton is bounded to the north by the cantons of Ba&s;il and Solothurn, and the Au&s;trian Fore&s;t-towns; to the &s;outh by the lake of Geneva, the Valais and duchy of Savoy; to the ea&s;t by Uri, Underwald, Lucern, and the county of Baden; and to the we&s;t by Solothurn, Neufchatel, Franche-Comt&eacute;, the di&s;trict of Biel, and the land of Gex. It is the mo&s;t fruitful, the riche&s;t, and by much the large&s;t of all the cantons, extending in length about &s;ixty leagues, and about thirty where broade&s;t. It yields not only plenty of grain, fruit, and pa|&s;ture, but al&s;o a good wine, a variety of coloured earths and clays, &s;and-&s;tone, mundick, gyp&s;um, pit-coal, &s;ulphur, and iron-ore. Here likewi&s;e are large herds of cattle, great and &s;mall; and, in con&s;equence of that, great quantities of milk, but|ter, and chee&s;e. The rivers that water this canton are the Aar, the Emmat, the Wigger, the Aaa, the Ru&s;z, the Limmat, the Sanen, the Sen&s;en, and the Kandel. The principal lake is that of Geneva, the length of which is about eighteen leagues, and the greate&s;t breadth between three and four. The depth in &s;ome places is near four hundred fathom, in others not above forty. The Rhone enters it at the ea&s;t end, near Bouveret, and i&s;&s;ues out again at the we&s;t, clo&s;e by Geneva. In &s;ummer its waters are much &s;welled by the melting of the &s;now on the mountains. This lake, however, is not entire|ly &s;urrounded by the territory of Bern, but partly
<PB N="379" REF="3830">
by Savoy and the country of Gex; the former of which belongs to the king of Sardinia, and the latter to France, and the territory of Sion. Its bor|ders are extremely fertile and beautiful, being much embelli&s;hed with vineyards, which yield excellent wine, and inter&s;per&s;ed with towns and villages, be|twixt which a con&s;iderable commerce is carried on. The other great lakes, that are wholly or partly within this canton, are tho&s;e of Neufchatel, Biel, Murte, Thun, Brien, and Halwyl, which all abound in fi&s;h, particularly that of Geneva, where trouts are &s;ometimes caught weighing forty or fifty pounds. In that of Biel, called al&s;o the Nydau|lake, are two &s;mall i&s;lands, one of which is very beautiful. This lake is about three leagues in length, and one in breadth. Along the whole we&s;t and north-we&s;t &s;ides of the canton runs that chain of mountains, called by the general name of Jura; but the &s;everal mountains of which it is com|po&s;ed, have all their particular names. This can|ton is well cultivated, and very populous, the number of its &s;ubjects being computed at four hun|dred thou&s;and. German is the prevailing language, but almo&s;t all the people of fa&s;hion &s;peak either French or Italian; even the common people in the Pais de Vaud, and other places, that lie towards France or Italy, &s;peak a corrupt French or Italian, or a jargon compo&s;ed of both. The e&s;tabli&s;hed reli|gion here, and the other prote&s;tant cantons, is Calvini&s;m, the &s;ame both in doctrine and di&s;ci|pline as in Holland; nor is any other tolerated, except in the common bailiages, and the vale of Frick. The mini&s;ters are divided into deaneries and cla&s;&s;es, and hold yearly chapters or &s;ynods. They are kept in a greater dependence on the civil power here, than in the other cantons, and not &s;uffered to interfere with matters of &s;tate. The city of Bern fir&s;t joined the con&s;ederacy in the
<PB N="380" REF="3840">
year 1353. Towards the defence thereof the can|ton now furni&s;hes two thou&s;and men. Every male, from &s;ixteen to &s;ixty, is inrolled in the militia, and about a third of them regimented. There are of|ficers for every di&s;trict, who&s;e province it is to &s;ee that the men be regularly exerci&s;ed; that their arms, ammunition, and cloathing, be in good condition; and that they be kept in a con&s;tant readine&s;s to march. Once a-year they are drawn out to a gene|ral review. The &s;ame attention is paid to tho&s;e that belong to the train of artillery. Some regiments con|&s;i&s;t of married, and &s;ome of unmarried men; &s;ome of foot, others of dragoons. There is al&s;o one regi|ment and a troop of cuira&s;&s;iers. The latter con|&s;i&s;ts entirely of burghers of Bern. Both the hor&s;e|men and footmen find their hor&s;es, arms, and ac|coutrements. Be&s;ides the arms and artillery in the ar&s;enal at Bern, all the ca&s;tles, where the country governors or bailiffs re&s;ide, are well furni&s;hed with them. At Bern is a con&s;tant guard or garri&s;on of two hundred men, and a &s;mall garri&s;on at fort Arburg. In the &s;ame city is al&s;o an office, which grants licences for levies to foreign powers, and where the recruits make their appearance, and are regi&s;tered. The bailiffs have the chief direc|tion of affairs in their &s;everal di&s;tricts, being gene|rals of the militia, and pre&s;iding in the courts of ju&s;tice; but, in civil cau&s;es, above a certain value, an appeal lies from them to Bern; and, in capital cau&s;es, their &s;entence mu&s;t be confirmed by the great council before it can be executed. When any bailiwic is to be di&s;po&s;ed of, as many balls as there are competitors are put into a bag, whereof one is gilt, and he that draws that has the bailiwic.</P>
<P>Mr. Key&s;ler ob&s;erves, that the wealthie&s;t pea|&s;ants in Switzerland are tho&s;e of Bern; it being difficult to find a village without one, at lea&s;t, who is worth between twenty and thirty thou&s;and guil|ders,
<PB N="381" REF="3850">
and &s;ometimes even &s;ixty thou&s;and. He &s;ays, the common people of both &s;exes wear &s;traw hats, and that the women's petticoats are tied up &s;o near their armpits, that hardly an hand's-breadth is left for their &s;hape; that the inns, not only in this canton but throughout Switzerland are in general, very good; that the manners of the people were, in many re&s;pects, greatly changed within fifty years before he vi&s;ited them, which was about thirty years ago, and con&s;equently mu&s;t be much more &s;o now; that, in&s;tead of the plainne&s;s and hone&s;t &s;implicity of their ance&s;tors, the love of &s;uperfluities and high living greatly prevailed; that luxury, pomp, and that infatuation for foreign productions, which had infected mo&s;t parts of Europe, had al&s;o extended its contagious influence to Switzerland, though not to &s;uch a degree as in many other countries. Dr. Burnet &s;ays, that drinking is &s;o common, and produces &s;o many quarrels and di&s;orders, that the bailiffs not only &s;ub&s;i&s;t by the fines payable for them, but often get e&s;tates, carrying, perhaps, twenty thou&s;and crowns, at the end of five years, to Bern; that their law is &s;hort and clear, in&s;omuch that the mo&s;t intricate &s;uit is ended after two, or perhaps three hearings, either in the fir&s;t in|&s;tance, before the bailiff, or in the &s;econd, at Bern; that the civility expre&s;&s;ed in this country to women, at fir&s;t meeting them, is not by &s;aluting them, but &s;haking them by the hand, and that none but &s;trangers take off their hats to them. Mr. Addi&s;on &s;ays, that the pea&s;ants are generally cloathed in a coar&s;e kind of canvas, the manufacture of the country, and that their holiday cloaths go from father to &s;on; &s;o that it is not uncommon to &s;ee a countryman in his great grandfather's doublet and breeches; that the belief of witchcraft prevailed among them &s;o much, that there were &s;ome exe|cutions on that account while he was in the country;
<PB N="382" REF="3860">
that the que&s;tion, or torture, is u&s;ed not only is this canton but all over Switzerland; that though the &s;ubjects of the &s;tate are rich, the public is poor; and though they could oppo&s;e a &s;udden inva&s;ion, yet that their unkindly &s;oil requires &s;uch a number of hands to cultivate it, that they could not &s;pare the reinforcements and recruits that would be nece&s;|&s;ary in a long war. Upon extraordinary occa&s;ions, however, they boa&s;t that they could rai&s;e eighty thou&s;and men in twenty-four hours. This can|ton is divided into the German country, that is, that part of the canton in which the German tongue is &s;poken, and which is al&s;o called the antient can|ton, extending from Morat to the county of Ba|den; and the Roman, called al&s;o the Waal, and Pais de Vaud. In the former of the&s;e, which con|tains thirty-five bailiwics, and about three hun|dred pari&s;hes, the principal places are,</P>
<P>Bern, which gives name to the whole canton, and is its capital. It is &s;aid that the taking of a bear on the day on which the foundation of this city was laid, gave occa&s;ion to its name, hence it is often in Latin called Arctopolis, i. e. the city of the Bear, and has a bear for its coat of arms. It is almo&s;t &s;urrounded by the river Aar. The hou&s;es are mo&s;tly built of white free-&s;tone, and, in the principal &s;treets, have piazzas, or arches, under them, for the conveniency of walk|ing dry in wet weather. Mo&s;t of the &s;treets are paved with flints and traver&s;ed by a canal lined with free-&s;tone, which is brought from a con|&s;iderable di&s;tance, and is very u&s;eful in carry|ing off the filth of the city, extingui&s;hing fires, and other purpo&s;es. The city is large, &s;tanding almo&s;t in the middle of the canton, and containing &s;everal churches, of which one is called the Great Church, and the fir&s;t mini&s;ter thereof, the dean, who is the head of the city-clergy. From an in&s;crip|tion near the great door of this church, it appears,
<PB N="383" REF="3870">
that the fir&s;t &s;tone of it was laid in 1421. Over the &s;ame door is a repre&s;entation of the la&s;t judge|ment, in which the &s;culptor hath placed the pope among the damned. In this city is al&s;o a college with eight profe&s;&s;ors, a large public library, and a mu&s;eum; a &s;tately granary, in which a great quan|tity of corn is always kept; a guildhall; a well &s;tored ar&s;enal; and &s;everal ho&s;pitals. In the ar&s;e|nal is a wooden &s;tatue of the famous Tell, which ropre&s;ents him as taking aim at the apple placed on the head of his &s;on. There is al&s;o the &s;ta|tue of Berch told von Zahringen, the founder of the city; and two large horns of buffaloes or wild bulls, called in Latin Uri, &s;uch as are u&s;ed in war by the canton of Uri in&s;tead of trumpets, and taken from it in the year 1712. Hard by al&s;o hang the grote&s;que dre&s;&s;es of tho&s;e who blew them. The inhabitants of Uri, who boa&s;t their de&s;cent from the old Tau, bear a buffalo's head in their ri&s;ci, coat of arms; and the per&s;on who blows the great horn in time of war, is called the bull of Uri. In the Dominican church, a hole in the wall is always &s;hewn to &s;trangers, by means of which, it having a communication with the cell of a monk in an adjoining mona&s;tery, the pious fraud of mak|ing an image of the Virgin appear to &s;peak, was once carried on, which for a while an&s;wered the purpo&s;es of the monks very well; but they were at la&s;t detected and puni&s;hed. This city, though larger, is not &s;o populous nor &s;o well built as that of Zu|rich. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of it is a hand&s;ome &s;tone bridge; and near the great church is a very fine platform &s;ome hundred feet in height, which makes a mo&s;t delightful walk, being planted with limes, and commanding a charming pro&s;pect, particularly of the mountains of the Gri&s;ons, covered with &s;now in the mid&s;t of &s;ummer. In 1654 a &s;tudent of divinity, being on hor&s;eback, and in liquor,
<PB N="384" REF="3880">
leaped over this terrace without receiving any other hurt than breaking a leg, and lived many years af|ter, but the hor&s;e was killed. In the upper part of the city are always kept a number of bears in two inclo&s;ures, with fir-trees for them to clamber and play upon. Of the burghers of Berne, only tho&s;e are qualified for the government and magi&s;tracy of of the city, who are the de&s;cendants of &s;uch as were made burghers before the year 1635. Other qualifications are al&s;o nece&s;&s;ary, in particular they mu&s;t not be under thirty years of age, and mu&s;t be enrolled in one of the twelve companies. To obtain a country government, or to hold any con|&s;iderable employment, the candidate al&s;o mu&s;t be married. The great council, in which the &s;ove|reignty of the canton is ve&s;ted, con&s;i&s;ts, when full, of two hundred and twenty-nine, but is generally much &s;hort of that number, eighty or more often dying before their places are filled up. The le&s;&s;er council &s;enate, or, as it is called, the daily council, becau&s;e it meets every day, Sundays and holydays excepted, con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-&s;even members, in|cluding the two praetors, or advoyers, the four tri|bunes of the people, the two trea&s;urers, and the two heimlichers, or &s;ecrecy-men, &s;o called, becau&s;e to them all &s;ecrets relating to the &s;tate are di&s;co|vered. The members of the great and little coun|cils mutually fill up the vacancies that hap|pen in the&s;e two colleges. How the bailiffs are cho&s;en we have already taken notice. Our limits will not permit us to enter into any fur|ther detail with re&s;pect to the government, only it is to be ob&s;erved in general, that all the officers of any note are cho&s;en out of the great or little councils; and that all the bailiffs and caf|tellans of the canton continue &s;ix years in office. The trade of the city is not very great, but was le&s;s before the French refugees &s;ettled therein; &s;ome, however, doubt whether it has been a gainer

Ratzli, a high hill in the ca&s;tellany of Upper Simmenthal, commanding a view, which, at fir&s;t &s;ight, is apt to excite terror, over an ei&s;meer, or icy lake, and &s;everal glet&s;chers, or hills, covered with ice and &s;now, all lying below it.</P>
<P>Frutigen, a village which gives name to a ca&s;|tellany, con&s;i&s;ting of a long valley. Throughout all Switzerland, there is no where &s;uch plenty of &s;ulphur veins, nor &s;uch rich ores, as in the neigh|bourhood of Kandel&s;tag in this valley.</P>
<P>Ha&s;zli, a village, giving name to a territory or valley of con&s;iderable extent, in which are fine woods of beech and pine, excellent roots, wild fowl of all kinds, chamois, and other mountain animals, together with mines, particularly of lead and iron, and fine chry&s;tals. Over a high moun|tain here called the Grim&s;el, or Grim&s;len-hill, lies a road, which is practicable only in &s;ummer, and is even then very difficult and dangerous, on account of the ice and &s;now: in &s;ome places there are bridges laid from one rock to another, in others, the road is hewn out of the &s;olid rock, and in others guarded with walls. The inhabitants of this di&s;trict, with great labour and expence, keep it in repair. On the top of the mountain is a lake, and at the foot of it, on the highway, &s;tands a hou&s;e, called an ho&s;pital, though properly &s;peaking it is only an inn. The innkeeper, or ho&s;pitaller, as he is called, is appointed every five years by the land|holders of the Ha&s;zli vale, and continues there as long as the road is practicable, accommodating travellers with victuals and drink. Such as are able pay for what they have; but the poorer &s;ort are entertained gratis, and the expence is defrayed by an annual collection made throughout the can|tons. Round the mountain runs an ei&s;thal, or ice valley, called Grim&s;elthal, in a part of which, named Zinkenberg, a cry&s;tal pit was di&s;covered in

It is probable there|fore, that a &s;on, or &s;ome other relation of his, marched &s;ome troops into Switzerland to a&s;&s;ert his claim; and as a great part of France was then &s;ubject to the Engli&s;h, the army he brought with him was, no doubt, partly compo&s;ed of that na|tion.</P>

The cognizance of criminal affairs belongs entirely to one quarter of the town, called St. Francis, and in that is one &s;treet, of which, if any of the inhabitants is guilty of a capital crime, the others have the &s;ole power of condemning or acquitting him. The whole town con&s;i&s;ts of &s;teep a&s;cents and de&s;cents, and takes its name from its &s;itua|tion betwixt the brooks Laus and Anna. It gives name to a bailiwic, the bailiff of which re|&s;ides in the ca&s;tle, which was formerly the bi&s;hop's palace, and has &s;ome juri&s;diction in the town. In the college here, Theodore Beza tran&s;lated the P&s;alms into French ver&s;e; and the fir&s;t profe&s;&s;or of law e&s;tabli&s;hed in it, was the late learned Barbey|rac, who died a profe&s;&s;or in one of the Dutch uni|ver&s;ities. The great church, which was antiently the cathedral, is a large Gothic &s;tructure, &s;aid to have been two hundred years in building: there
<PB N="390" REF="3940">
are two hundred and &s;eventy-two marble columns in it, &s;ome or which, we are told, are of one piece. In the wall is a fi&s;&s;ure, once large enough for a man to creep through, which was occa&s;ioned by an earthquake in 1634, and, ten years after, was clo&s;ed up by another. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of the town is a very plea&s;ant walk, with a charming pro&s;pect of the city, and the lake, which, though half a league off, &s;eems to be hard by: the view is much the &s;ame from the terrace by the great church. In &s;hort, &s;uch is the beauty of this country, the charming contra&s;t of hills and vallies, corn fields, meadows, vineyards, and woods, with the additional recommendation of a noble lake and mild government, that per&s;ons of all ranks and countries flock hither, and to the other towns in the Pais de Vaud. The bailiwic to which this town gives name, is the large&s;t in the whole country, and contains &s;everal other &s;mall towns, as St. Saphorin, noted for its wine, Cu|illi, Lu&s;try, and Vilette, all on the lake; Corzi &s;us Vevay, or Cor&s;ier, &s;ituated in Rys-vale, which is celebrated for its wine, known by the name of Ryftwein.</P>

<HEAD>In the di&s;trict called the ARGAU, from its &s;ituation on both &s;ides the Aar, are the four towns of Brugg or Bruck, Lenzburg, Arau, and Zof|fingen, which &s;ubmitted to this canton in 1415, but are independent of any bailiwic, and enjoy great privileges under the immediate &s;overeignty of Bern.</HEAD>
<P>Brugg or Bruck, in Latin Pons Arulae, is &s;o called from its fine &s;tone bridge, over the Aaar or Aren. Here are &s;everal councils, from which an appeal lies to the German council at Bern. It is a pretty large well built city, and has a hand|&s;ome town-hou&s;e, with a public library, college, and granary. In the neighbourhood of this town formerly &s;tood Vindoni&s;&s;a, a town of Helvetia, de|&s;troyed by Con&s;tantius; and the rich abbey of Ko|nigsfelden. The celebrated old ca&s;tle of Hab&s;burg, the original family &s;eat of the counts of that title, from whom de&s;cended the augu&s;t hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria, &s;tands high, on the river Aar, about a league from Brugg, and was built in the eleventh century, by Werner, bi&s;hop of Stra&s;burg.</P>
<P>Lenzburg is a neat little town, with a ca&s;tle, &s;eated on a mountain, in a plea&s;ant fertile country, and giving name to a bailiwic of great extent; but the bailiff has little or no authority in the town.</P>
<P>Arau is not a very large but a very plea&s;ant town, &s;eated on the Aaar, from which it takes its name,
<PB N="393" REF="3970">
and on which it has a covered bridge. It &s;tands thirty miles north-ea&s;t of Bern, and is noted for being the place where the prote&s;tant towns and cantons hold their a&s;&s;emblies. Here al&s;o an end was put to the war that broke out, in 1712, between &s;ome of the prote&s;tant and popi&s;h cantons. The inhabitants are &s;o jealous of their franchi&s;es, that if a burgher, condemned by his judges, ap|peals to Bern, he lo&s;es his freedom. To the town al&s;o belong the high and low juri&s;diction within its di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Zoffingen is a &s;mall town, &s;eated on the river Wigger, and under its own regency. Here is a public library, enriched with &s;ome curious ma|nu&s;cripts, and increa&s;ing every day. Nicholas Dut, who was advoyer of this town, and as &s;uch carried its colours at the battle of Sempach, in 1386, finding him&s;elf &s;urrounded by the enemy, tore the colours in pieces, and crammed them into his mouth, where they were found after his death, and carried back to the town-hou&s;e.</P>

<P>This canton is the large&s;t and mo&s;t powerful of the popi&s;h cantons, its greate&s;t length being about forty-eight miles, and its greate&s;t breadth about thirty-two. It is bounded on the ea&s;t by the can|tons of Zug and Schweiz, and the free provinces, towards the north and we&s;t it terminates on the canton of Bern, and towards the &s;outh on the can|ton of Underwalden. A part of the canton is mountainous, yet yields good pa&s;ture, both for &s;heep and cattle: the more level parts are fruit|ful in corn, &s;o that it has not only enough for it&s;elf, but al&s;o to &s;pare to its neighbours, the le&s;&s;er and more barren cantons. There are &s;everal lakes in it, great or &s;mall, abounding with fi&s;h, and al&s;o
<PB N="394" REF="3980">
rivers, of which the Ru&s;z, the greater and le&s;&s;er Emmat, and Goldbach are the chief; the two la&s;t are &s;aid to be aurifluous. Pilate's Hill, in this canton, is one of the highe&s;t in Switzerland, and has a lake on the top. Lucern acceded to the Hel|vetic alliance in the year 1322: its government is ari&s;tocratical, and its chief revenue ari&s;es from the e&s;tates of the extinct nobility: it is &s;aid to be able to rai&s;e fifteen hundred men, and is noted for its inveteracy again&s;t prote&s;tanti&s;m. The places of mo&s;t note in the canton are,</P>
<P>Lucern, from which it has its name, &s;tanding on a branch of the four fore&s;t-towns lake, called al&s;o the lake of Lucern, where the Ru&s;z i&s;&s;ues from it; twenty-two miles from Zurich, and twenty-four from Bern. It is a con&s;iderable thoroughfare to Italy, and contains an ar&s;enal, a magnificent Je&s;uit's college and town hou&s;e, &s;everal convents, with a ca|thedral or collegiate church, in which is an organ &s;o large that an ordinary man may creep into the greater pipes. A nuncio from the pope u&s;ually re&s;ides here. The town is &s;uppo&s;ed to have had its name from a lucerna, or lantern, &s;et up here to direct pa&s;&s;engers on the lake in the night. The government of the town and canton is lodged in a great and little council, cho&s;en out of the burgh|ers. The catholic cantons u&s;ually have their par|ticular diet here. Both town and canton are in the dioce&s;e of Con&s;tance.</P>

<P>This canton is bounded to the north by the canton of Schwitz; to the &s;outh by &s;ome of the Italian bailiwics; to the ea&s;t by the Gri&s;ons, and the canton of Glaris; and on the we&s;t by the can|tons of Bern and Underwald. Its length is about &s;ixty miles, and its breadth upwards of twenty. It con&s;i&s;ts almo&s;t every where of high mountains and deep vallies. The mountain called St. Gotthard&s;|berg, is the highe&s;t in Switzerland, if not in Eu|rope. A road lies over it to Italy, which a&s;cends continually for eight hours, or twenty-four miles, and is practicable not only to hor&s;es, but carriages. The height of the mountain, the &s;now and ice, woods, naked rocks, precipices, ca&s;cades, green pa&s;tures, lakes, the noi&s;e of the river Ru&s;z, and other torrents, heightened by the echoes among the hollows of the mountain, pre&s;ent altogether, both to the eyes and ears of a traveller, a very ro|mantic, awful, and maje&s;tic &s;cene. In a certain part of the mountain, near the highway, is a Ca|puchin convent, in which two fathers con&s;tantly
<PB N="396" REF="4000">
attend, and, for a &s;mall con&s;ideration, accommo|date travellers with whatever is wanted. Many thou&s;and head of cattle graze on this, and the other mountains here, in &s;ummer; and great quan|tities of chee&s;e are made on them. The vales be|tween the&s;e mountains are excceding hot in &s;um|mer, and yield the mo&s;t luxuriant crops of gra&s;s: mo&s;t beautiful chry&s;tals al&s;o are often found among them. The inhabitants are a hardy, vigorous, and brave people, but noted for their blind zeal and bigotry. Mo&s;t part of the income of this &s;tate ari&s;es from the impo&s;ts on goods carried betwixt Italy and Germany, and the annual pen&s;ions they receive from the kings of France and Spain. They have no wine, little corn, and few or no manu|factures; but plenty of wood, fi&s;h, black cattle, butter, and chee&s;e, with which they purcha&s;e what nece&s;&s;aries they want. They are reckoned about twenty thou&s;and in number, of which tho&s;e of better fa&s;hion live by the flocks and herds they keep in their grounds; and the meaner &s;ort by tending the&s;e herds, or hawking and peddling Ger|man and Italian wares. The government here is democratical, as in all the other petty cantons, where they have hardly any towns, but live di&s;|per&s;ed in villages. The landes gemeine, or gene|ral a&s;&s;embly of the canton, is held annually on the fir&s;t Sunday of May, and in that every male, above &s;ixteen, has a vote. The landrathe or council ordi|narily con&s;i&s;ts of &s;ix per&s;ons, deputed from each of the communities into which the conton is di|vided, who are nominated from among the prin|cipal officers and magi&s;trates. The pre&s;ident of the council is called the Landamman. Some of their magi&s;tates are generally innkeepers. In ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical matters, they are &s;ubject to the bi&s;hops of Con&s;tance, Coire, or Como. The only places in the canton, de&s;erving the name of towns, are,</P>
<P><PB N="397" REF="4010">
Altorf, i. e. the Old Village, &s;tanding twenty-three miles &s;outh-ea&s;t of Lucern, not far from the Reu&s;z, and the Vier Wald&s;tadter&s;ee, or lake of the four fore&s;t towns. It is well built, being the &s;eat of the government, and the place where mo&s;t of the gentry re&s;ide; containing an ar&s;enal, a gra|nary, a hand&s;ome town-hou&s;e, with a hou&s;e for cutting and poli&s;hing chry&s;tal, three churches, and two convents.</P>
<P>Geornico, in German, Irnis, a pretty large market town, &s;tanding on both &s;ides the Te&s;&s;in.</P>
<P>The mo&s;t remarkable vallies are,</P>
<P>Meyden, a very wild vale, containing a chapel, and &s;ome &s;cattered habitations.</P>
<P>Livinirthal, in Latin, Vallis Lepontina, lying on the other &s;ide of St. Gotthardt's mountain, to|wards Italy, with the Te&s;in running through it. Galeazzo Maria, duke of Milan, ceded this valley to the canton in 1446. Its inhabitants are Italians, dependent in &s;pirituals on the bi&s;hop of Camo, and governed by a bailiff &s;ent from Uri.</P>
<P>Ur&s;erenthal, or Ur&s;eren valley, which is about three leagues in length, and one in breadth, and yields good pa&s;turage, but wants wood; &s;o that the inhabitants have no other fuel, but wild ro&s;e|trees, and a kind of heath or broom. The&s;e inha|bitants are a free people, and rather allies, than &s;ubjects of the canton of Uri. In eccle&s;ia&s;tical mat|ters, they are &s;ubject to the bi&s;hop of Coire. The valley begins a little beyond a bridge over the Reu&s;z, on St. Gotthardt's mountain, called the Devil's-bridge, being of &s;uch a height, with its founda|tions laid on rocks, almo&s;t as low as the bed of the river, which is here very impetuous, that every one who &s;ees it, is a&s;toni&s;hed how it was erected.</P>

<P>This canton to the &s;outh borders on Uri; to the north on the Zurich &s;ee; to the ea&s;t on Glaris; and to the we&s;t on Lucern, Zug, and Zurich. It is above thirty miles in length, and twenty in breadth. With re&s;pect to its &s;oil, government, and religion, they are much the &s;ame as tho&s;e of Uri: its inhabitants too, like tho&s;e of that canton, are hardy, bold, and vigorous: their land, for the mo&s;t part, is pa&s;ture ground, yielding little corn, and no wine; but they have plenty of fi&s;h from their lakes and rivers, with black cattle, game, butter, and chee&s;e. In &s;pirituals they are &s;ubject to the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance. Though this is one of the petty cantons, and only the &s;econd in rank among the&s;e, yet it has the honour of giving name to the whole confederacy. The inhabitants are de&s;cended from the Cimbrians, who, after being defeated by Marius, the Roman general, fled to the&s;e mountains. In 1308 they threw off the Au&s;trian yoke, and united with Uri and Underwald, for the defence of their common rights; and by the&s;e three, Leopold, duke of Au|&s;tria, was totally defeated at Morgart, in this can|ton. The principal places in it, or under its &s;ove|reignty, are,</P>
<P>Schweiz, which gives name to it, and is its capi|tal, and the &s;eat of the regency. It &s;tands ten miles from Lucern, in a plea&s;ant valley between hills, that are generally covered with &s;now, and contains, be&s;ides a pari&s;h church, three convents, a town hou&s;e, a mint, an ho&s;pital, an ar&s;enal, and &s;everal hand&s;ome private hou&s;es.</P>
<P>Brunnen, a village on the lake of the four can|tons, commonly called the lake of Lucern, where in 1315, the cantons of Uri, Schweiz, and Under|wald, entered into a perpetual alliance, and there|by

laid the foundation of the Helvetic confede|racy.</P>
<P>Unterart, a free borough on the Zug-lake, which gives name to one of the &s;ix parts or di&s;tricts, into which the canton is divided.</P>
<P>Lachen, a &s;mall place, with a harbour, on the lake of Zurich, and in the di&s;trict of March or Mark. That di&s;trict, which is fruitful, and lies along the lake, belonged to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, till 1405, when being reduced by the people of Appenzel, it was transferred by them to this can|ton, as an acknowledgment for their a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The inhabitants have great privileges.</P>
<P>Ein&s;idlen, a &s;mall town, near the river Meu&s;e, ten miles north-ea&s;t from Schweiz. Here is a rich Benedictine abbey, the abbot of which has the title of prince, and is lord of the town and its territory, under the &s;overeignty, or rather the protection of the canton. Paracel&s;us, the famous phy&s;ician, was born here, and died at Saltzburg in 1540. It was owing to the prodigious re&s;ort of pilgrims to the abbey, to pay their vows or devotions to the Virgin, that the neighbouring country, which was formerly a gloomy fore&s;t, is now full of villages and farm hou&s;es. Over the door of the chapel of the Virgin is in&s;cribed, in large characters, the&s;e words, <HI>Hic e&s;t plena remi&s;&s;io peccatorium a culpa &amp; a poena;</HI> i. e. Here is full remi&s;&s;ion both of the guilt and puni&s;hment of &s;inners. The trea&s;ure of the abbey is of immen&s;e value: in particular, here is a large pyx, which, be&s;ides one hundred and &s;ixty ounces of gold, is adorned with one hundred and &s;eventy-four large pearls, three hundred and three diamonds, thirty-eight &s;apphires, one hundred and fifty-four emeralds, eight hundred and &s;ixty rubies, forty-four garnets, twenty-&s;ix hyacinths, and nineteen amethy&s;ts. The abbey was rebuilt in 1704, and is a large &s;plendid edifice, contain|ing
<PB N="400" REF="4040">
magnificent apartments for the abbot, with a library, and convenient rooms for the reclu&s;es, and the entertainment of &s;trangers. The church of our Lady is embelli&s;hed with ma&s;terly paintings, rich guildings, and mo&s;t delicate &s;tucco-work. In the di&s;trict belonging to the abbey is al&s;o a nun|nery, containing a trea&s;ure of great value, and de|pendent on the abbey, which is al&s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the Aufnau, a &s;mall delightful i&s;land in the Zurich&s;ee, with lands, juri&s;dictions, and preroga|tives, in many other places.</P>

<HEAD>UNDERWALD.</HEAD>
<P>This canton is divided by a fore&s;t into two parts, denominated Ober and Underwald, i. e. above and below the fore&s;t; but the canton bears only the name of the latter. Northward and we&s;t|ward it is bounded by the canton and part of the lake of Lucern; &s;outhward by the cantons of Uri and Bern; ea&s;tward by that of Uri; being eighteen miles from north to &s;outh, and fifteen from ea&s;t to we&s;t. Here is little corn or wine, but fine fruits, pa&s;tures, woods, and cattle, with lakes, mi|neral &s;prings, and quarries of marble. One of its vallies is called the Melchthal, or Milk-Vale. The two parts mentioned above make two com|munities, which have each their re&s;pective chief, diet, council, &s;eal, banner, and officers; but as they both con&s;titute only one canton, they have al&s;o a common-council. Both are of the popi&s;h religion, and in the dioce&s;e of Con&s;tance: as the Oberwald has two thirds of the public re|venue, it pays al&s;o two-thirds of the public ex|pences. Though both &s;end a repre&s;entative to the general diet of the cantons, yet they have but one voice: this canton &s;hook off the Au&s;trian yoke at the &s;ame time as the two la&s;t de&s;cribed. The capital of the vale above the fore&s;t is Sarnen, on

It is not above twelve miles either way, but much more populous and fruitful than any of the three former, yielding wine, wheat, che&s;nuts, and other fruits, in its vales, and ex|cellent pa&s;ture on its mountains. The inhabitants of this canton are as &s;taunch Roman catholics as tho&s;e of the four la&s;t mentioned. It lies in the dio|ce&s;e of Con&s;tance, and its government, like that of the three la&s;t, is democratical. There are two lakes in it, abounding in fi&s;h, particularly large carps, pikes, and a &s;pecies of trouts, called rotels; as well as &s;everal woods, full of game.

Va&s;t numbers of hor&s;es, black cattle, goats, and &s;heep, graze both on the mountains and in the vallies, and great quantities of butter and chee&s;e are made in both. The mountains yield al&s;o wood, &s;late, chry&s;tal, mineral waters, and baths, and the rivers and lakes abound with fi&s;h. The government, like that of the pre|ceding petty cantons, is democratical; but the greater part of the inhabitants are prote&s;tants. Their principal bu&s;ine&s;s is grazing. About &s;ome of the lakes, the winds are remarkably regular in their ri&s;ing, falling, and &s;hifting; for in the morning an ea&s;terly breeze &s;ets in, and continues until ten, when a calm en&s;ues until noon, then a we&s;terly breeze &s;prings up until &s;un-&s;et, when, if the weather is fair, it &s;hifts to the ea&s;t. Dr. Bur|net tells us, that in all &s;uits at law here, betwixt tho&s;e of different religions, two-thirds of the judges mu&s;t be of the religion of the defendant. Matri|monial cau&s;es, among the prote&s;tants or Calvini&s;ts, are determined by the con&s;i&s;tory. Be&s;ides the ge|neral diet of both religions, held annually in a field without the town of Glaris, there are particular diets of each religion, held al&s;o annually; that of
<PB N="403" REF="4070">
the Calvini&s;ts at Schwanden, and that of the papi&s;ts in a field between Net&s;tall, and Naffels. Here, as in the other democratical cantons, be&s;ides the diets called lande&s;gemeine, there is a landrathe, i. e. a council or regency, with &s;everal courts of ju&s;tice, for civil, criminal, and eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs. The principal officers are the amman, &s;tadtholder, and banneret. The militia con&s;i&s;t of &s;even companies. The places of mo&s;t note in the canton are,</P>
<P>Glaris, which gives name to it, is a large hand|&s;ome town on the river Linth, having a week|ly market, and &s;everal annual fairs.</P>
<P>Elm, a village, &s;o hemmed in with high moun|tains that the inhabitants, for &s;everal weeks in the year, never &s;ee the &s;un.</P>
<P>Naffels, a pretty little town upon the Linth, near which, in the year 1308, three hundred and fifty Switzers defeated eight thou&s;and (&s;ome &s;ay fifteen thou&s;and) Au&s;trians.</P>
<P>Schwanden, a country town, giving name to a pari&s;h entirely prote&s;tant, and the large&s;t in the canton, next to that of Glaris.</P>
<P>Werdenburg, a &s;mall town, giving name to a county on the Rhine, belonging to this canton. The inhabitants of the county are all prote&s;tants, and their bailiff is al&s;o always &s;uch. There is a chain of hills here called the Freyberg, or Free Mountain, becau&s;e none but twelve &s;worn hunters are allowed to hunt upon it, and that only in &s;um|mer, and for a marriage-fea&s;t, when they mu&s;t ne|ver kill more than a couple of Chamois goats.</P>

<P>This canton was no part of the antient Switzer|land, or Helvetia, but was even then an ally, as it is now a member of the laudable Helvetic body. It is bounded to the &s;outh by the canton of Solo|thurn, to the north by a part of the margravate of Baden-Dourlach and the territory of Rheinfelden, to the ea&s;t by the Frickthal, and to the we&s;t by Solothurn, the dioce&s;e of Ba&s;il, and the Sundgau, being upwards of twenty miles in length, and about eighteen in breadth. It is entirely pro|te&s;tant, and contains twenty-&s;even pari&s;hes, and &s;even bailiwics. The lower parts of it are fruit|ful in pa&s;ture, corn, and wine, but the mountains extremely barren. There are many medicinal &s;prings and baths in it, and the air is whole&s;ome and temperate. Both men and women, for the mo&s;t part, wear the French dre&s;s; but the lan|guage commonly &s;poken is High-Dutch, though the French al&s;o is much u&s;ed. This canton join|ed the confederacy in the year 1501. Its govern|ment, like that of Bern, Zurich, and Lucern, is ari&s;tocratical; and its revenues ari&s;e chiefly from &s;ecularized abbeys, and impo&s;ts on goods carried through the country, to and from France, Italy, and Germany. Be&s;ides the military e&s;tabli&s;hment of the city of Ba&s;il, there are two provincial regi|ments, con&s;i&s;ting each of ten companies, and a troop of dragoons. The places of mo&s;t note in the canton are,</P>
<P>Ba&s;il, which gives name to it, and is its capital. This is the large&s;t city in all Switzerland, having two hundred and twenty &s;treets, and &s;ix market-places or &s;quares. Its environs are exceeding beautiful, con&s;i&s;ting of a fine level tract of fields and meadows. The city is divided into two parts

by the Rhine, over which there is a hand&s;ome bridge. It is thought to have ri&s;en on the ruins of the old Augu&s;ta Rauracorum. For its name of Ba&s;ilia, it is indebted to Julian the Apo&s;tate, who would have it &s;o called, in honour of his mother Ba&s;ilina. It is fortified with walls, moats, towers, and ba&s;tions, and contains &s;everal churches, be&s;ides the cathedral, which is an old Gothic &s;tructure; a commandery of the order of St. John, and another of the Teutonic order; a public granary, and ar&s;e|nal; a &s;tately town-hou&s;e, in which is an exqui&s;ite piece of the &s;ufferings of Chri&s;t, by Holbein, and a &s;tatue of Munatius Plancus, a Roman general, who, about fifty years before Chri&s;t, built the antient city of Augu&s;ta Rauracorum; an univer&s;ity, which was founded in 1459, and has a curious phy&s;ic|garden, library, and mu&s;eum; a gymna&s;ium; a &s;tately palace, belonging to the margrave of Baden-Dourlach; be&s;ides a chamber of curio&s;ities, &s;e|veral ho&s;pitals. &amp;c. In the ar&s;enal is &s;hewn the ar|mour in which Charles the Bold lo&s;t his life, with the furniture of his hor&s;e, and the kettle-drums and trumpets of his army. On the &s;tair-ca&s;e of the council-hou&s;e, is a picture of the la&s;t Judgment, in which, though drawn before the Reformation, popes, cardinals, monks, and prie&s;ts, are repre&s;ent|ed in the torments of hell. Over-again&s;t the French church, on a long covered wall, is painted the dance of death; where the king of Terrors is repre&s;ented as mixing with all ranks and ages, and complimenting them, in German ver&s;es, on their arrival at the grave. St. Peter's &s;quare, planted with elm and lime-trees, makes a plea&s;ant walk; but a &s;pot regularly planted with trees, clo&s;e by the river, and near the min&s;ter, makes &s;till a finer, as commanding a mo&s;t beautiful and exten&s;ive pro|&s;pect. The celebrated Era&s;mus died here, in 1536, in the &s;eventieth year of his age, and was buried in
<PB N="406" REF="4100">
the great church. He left his library and cabinet of rarities to one Amberbach, a learned lawyer of this city, of who&s;e heirs they were purcha&s;ed by the univer&s;ity. Be&s;ides this cabinet, there are &s;everal other curious private ones. The clocks of this city go an hour fa&s;ter than el&s;ewhere, except at Con&s;tance, a circum&s;tance, which &s;ome a&s;cribe to the famous councils held there, when it was thought the be&s;t expedient to bring the fathers earlier to the a&s;&s;em|bly, for the quicker di&s;patch of bu&s;ine&s;s; but others &s;ay, that, in Ba&s;il, it was owing to a con&s;piracy being defeated by that means. Trade &s;till flouri&s;hes here, e&s;pecially in &s;ilk, ribbons, and wines; and the police is under excellent regulations. Mo&s;t of the offices are be&s;towed, by lot, among well qualified per&s;ons. No per&s;on, without the city, mu&s;t wear lace of gold or &s;ilver. All young women are pro|hibited from wearing &s;ilks; and the neare&s;t rela|tions only are to be invited to a marriage-fea&s;t. For the government of the city there are &s;everal councils or colleges, and officers. Of the la&s;t the two burgoma&s;ters, and two wardens of trades, are the chief. The great council is compo&s;ed of the repre&s;entatives of the &s;everal companies of the greater and le&s;&s;er city. Ba&s;il was the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop till the Reformation; but though there is one that &s;till bears the title, he has now no juri&s;|diction here, and lives at Porentru, near the Upper Al&s;ace.

<P>This canton is near forty miles in length, and above twenty in breadth. It is encompa&s;&s;ed on all &s;ides by the canton of Bern, a few places excepted, which lie on the lake of Neufchatel, and the bailiwics of Murten and Schwarzenburg. It is partly mountainous, and partly champaign, and, be&s;ides &s;ome wine, yields plenty of pa&s;turage, grain, fruit, cattle, and chee&s;e. France &s;upplies it with &s;alt, and the Pais de Vaud with wine. It is divided into three inner bailiwics, and &s;ixteen outer, be&s;ides the territory of the city. A medley of French and German is &s;poken in &s;ome places,
<PB N="408" REF="4120">
but in others German only. The canton is entirely popi&s;h, and contains an hundred and four pari&s;hes, under the juri&s;diction of the bi&s;hop of Lau&s;anne, who re&s;ides at Freyburg. It became a member of the Helvetic body in 1481. The government is ari&s;tocratical, and its militia con&s;i&s;ts of eleven re|giments, be&s;ides the burghers of Freyburg. The places of mo&s;t note are,</P>
<P>Freyburg, which gives name to it, and is its ca|pital. It is called Freyburg in Uchtlande, to di|&s;tingui&s;h it from Freyburg in the Bri&s;gaw, &s;tands among rocks, in a valley, on the river Saone, &s;ix leagues &s;outh-we&s;t from Bern. Here are &s;eve|ral churches, convents, and ho&s;pitals, with a col|lege of Je&s;uits, a mint, a granary, an ar&s;enal, a commandery of St. John, and a council-hou&s;e, which &s;tands on a rock, and commands a grand pro&s;pect. The government is much the &s;ame as that of Bern; except that here it is confined to &s;e|venty families of patricians, exclu&s;ive of all others. The town is tolerably fortified. May the &s;econd, and the twenty-&s;econd of June, are ob&s;erved here as great fe&s;tivals, for two &s;ignal victories gained on the&s;e days over Charles the Bold. It is &s;aid, if a debtor in this town does not pay at the time ap|pointed, the creditor &s;ends his &s;ervants and hor&s;es to a public inn, where the debtor is obliged to maintain them, till he pays the debt. At the di|&s;tance of a league from Freyburg, in a wilderne&s;s of woods and rocks, is a remarkable hermitage, con&s;i&s;ting of a church and &s;teeple, with an oratory, a hall, dining-room, kitchen, &s;everal chambers, and &s;tairs, a cellar, well, and other conveniences, all hewn out of a rock, not excepting the chimney and &s;teeple, notwith&s;tanding the latter is fifty-four feet high. A part of the rock was al&s;o cut into a flat for a garden, covered with earth, and planted with fruit and dwarf-trees of all &s;orts, and
<PB N="409" REF="4130">
pot-herbs. Be&s;ides all this, the water of a cry|&s;tal &s;pring was conveyed, by &s;everal channels, into &s;mall re&s;ervoirs, for watering the garden, and other purpo&s;es. A work like this cannot fail of filling the mind of every &s;pectator with a&s;toni&s;h|ment; but that mu&s;t be greatly increa&s;ed, when it is known, that it was wholly performed by only one man and a boy, in the &s;pace of twenty-five years. The ingenious architect was unhappily drowned, in the year 1708, in the river Sane, as he was conveying back &s;ome young people, that had attended the con&s;ecration of his little church, in a &s;mall boat, by the help of which he u&s;ed, every week, to bring provi&s;ions, and other nece&s;&s;aries, from the city. The place of the decea&s;ed hermit is &s;aid to be now &s;upplied by a prie&s;t, who &s;ub&s;i&s;ts by the charities of &s;trangers that come to &s;ee the hermitage, whom he generally regales with bread, wine, and a no&s;egay.</P>

<P>This canton, called by the French Soleurre, is bounded on the ea&s;t and &s;outh by that of Bern, and on the north and we&s;t by the bi&s;hopric or canton of Ba&s;il; extending on both &s;ides the river Aar, about twelve miles from north to &s;outh, and ten where broade&s;t. This canton, though part of it con&s;i&s;ts of the mountain of Jura, is tolerably fertile, yielding corn, wine, fine woods, fruits, and pa|&s;tures. The religion profe&s;&s;ed in it is the Roman catholic, except in one bailiwic; and the govern|ment is ari&s;tocratical. It became a member of the Helvetic body in 1481, and is &s;aid to be able to rai&s;e ten thou&s;and men. In &s;pirituals it is &s;ubject partly to the bi&s;hop of Lau&s;anne, and partly to

<P>Solothurn, which gives name to it, and is its ca|pital, &s;tanding on the river Aar, &s;eventeen miles north of Bern, and thirty-one &s;outh of Ba&s;il. It was a place of &s;trength in the time of the Romans, and &s;everal of their medals, in&s;criptions, and other antiquities have been found here. It is &s;ituated in a plea&s;ant, fertile country, and well fortified. In the collegiate church dedicated to St. Ur&s;ina, are &s;everal fine tombs and monuments; but &s;ome of the images are very gro&s;s, particularly one repre&s;ent|ing God the father as an old man, with a black beard, having our Saviour on his knees, and a pi|geon over his head. The church and college of the Je&s;uits are reckoned the fine&s;t in all Switzerland, and are &s;aid to have co&s;t above four hundred thou|&s;and livres. Here al&s;o is a well furni&s;hed ar&s;enal, and two convents, one which, namely, that of the Cordeliers, is the re&s;idence of the French envoy to the cantons. The government is much the &s;ame as that of Bern and Friburg, for here is a greater and le&s;&s;er council, with other &s;ubordinate colleges, courts, and offices, two advoyers, a banneret, and trea&s;urer. The language &s;poken here is the French. Eleven bailiwics are &s;ubject to this town, be&s;ides tho&s;e that it po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es in common with other cantons.</P>

<P>This is the mo&s;t northern of all the cantons of Switzerland, and lies entirely on the German &s;ide of the Rhine. It is bounded on the &s;outh by the canton of Zurich, from which it is &s;eparated by the Rhine; on the we&s;t by the Black Fore&s;t; and on the north and ea&s;t by Swabia: its greate&s;t length being about twenty miles, and its breadth twelve. It is abundantly fertile, yielding corn, fruit, pa|&s;ture, plenty of fi&s;h, mineral &s;prings, and good red wine. It was admitted a member of the Hel|vetic body in 1501. The inhabitants are Calvin|i&s;ts, and the government ari&s;tocratical. As for towns, the only one in it worth de&s;cribing is,</P>
<P>Schaffhau&s;en, which gives name to it, and is its capital. It is plea&s;antly &s;ituated in a plain on the Rhine, and is very hand&s;ome, the &s;treets being broad, and the hou&s;es magnificent. Here are &s;everal churches (of which that of St. John is &s;aid to be the large&s;t in all Switzerland, and that of All-Saints e&s;teemed a very fine &s;tructure) an ar&s;enal, an academy, of which the city pa&s;tors are profe&s;&s;ors, a noble cabinet of rarities, collected by the learned Charles Patin, who was a profe&s;&s;or at Padua, with a fortre&s;s, which &s;tands on the high|e&s;t ground in the town, called the Emmer&s;berg, and con&s;equently commands it. The city carries on a good trade by the Rhine, over which it has a hand|&s;ome &s;tone-bridge. As its name, in German, &s;igni|fies a &s;heepfold, &s;o it has a &s;heep for its coat of arms, and upon its coin. The fountains here, and in other parts of Switzerland, have generally pillars in the mid&s;t of their ba&s;ons, with &s;tatues on them of William Tell, and the other deliverers of their country. Here al&s;o, as in the other ari&s;tocratical cantons, is a greater and le&s;&s;er council, which are

cho&s;en out of the twelve companies of burghers, and from which all the town-offices are filled up. In the &s;uburbs is a &s;pring of water in a cellar, &s;o plentiful, that it &s;upplies above one hundred pipes, and, in the neighbourhood, is a fine free-&s;tone quarry. The town was originally called Scaph|hau&s;en, i. e. the barge or boat-hou&s;e, from a ferry that was here formerly over the river.</P>

<P>This is the la&s;t, and one of the lea&s;t of the thir|teen cantons. It con&s;i&s;ts only of three or four val|lies, having the town and abbey of St. Gall on the north; the county of Toggenburg on the we&s;t; the lord&s;hip of Sax, in the canton of Zurich, and that of Gambs, in the canton of Schweiz, on the &s;outh; and the Rheinthal, or Rhine valley, on the ea&s;t. Its greate&s;t length is about thirty miles, and its breadth about twenty. It yields good pa|&s;turage, and con&s;equently is not de&s;titute of cattle, milk, butter, or chee&s;e. Con&s;iderable quantities al&s;o of wheat, rye, barley, oats, beans, peas, flax, and wine, are produced in it; be&s;ides a great deal of fruit, wood, and turf, with mineral waters, and warm baths. There are many mountains in the canton, the highe&s;t of which is that called the Hohe&s;antis, or the Hohe-Me&s;zmer, which com|mands a pro&s;pect of a prodigious extent. There are al&s;o &s;everal lakes and rivers. The inhabitants, who are partly prote&s;tants, and partly Roman ca|tholics, &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by their manufactures of linen, crape, fu&s;tian, and thread, or by bleaching, and the &s;ale of their cattle, butter, chee&s;e, hor&s;es, wood, and coal. Of the twenty-three pari&s;hes in
<PB N="413" REF="4170">
the canton, four are popi&s;h and nineteen prote&s;tant. Before the Reformation, the inhabitants were &s;ubject to the abbot of St. Gall, but they then &s;hook off his yoke, and united them&s;elves with the other can|tons; after that, however, there were violent ani|mo&s;ities between the papi&s;ts and prote&s;tants, the former continually per&s;ecuting the latter, till at la&s;t, in 1587, by the mediation of the other cantons, the two parties came to an accommodation, by which certain di&s;tricts were a&s;&s;igned to each party: whereas before they lived promi&s;cuou&s;ly together, and though the&s;e two divi&s;ions now con&s;titute but one canton, yet each forms a di&s;tinct community or free &s;tate, &s;ending its particular repre&s;entatives to the diets of the confederacy, and having its &s;e|parate councils and officers. In &s;pirituals the pa|pi&s;ts are &s;ubject to the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance, but the prote&s;tants to their own con&s;i&s;tory. The mi|litia of the former does not exceed three thou&s;and, whereas tho&s;e of the latter amount to ten thou&s;and. The places of mo&s;t note in the canton are,</P>

It is a very large, populous bailiwic, and takes its name from the river Thur, which traver&s;es it. Though &s;omewhat mountainous towards the &s;outh, it is, in general, a fruitful country, yielding grain and wine, with good pa&s;ture, and fruits of all kinds. About a third of its inhabitants are papi&s;ts under the bi&s;hop of Con&s;tance, and the re&s;t Calvi|ni&s;ts. The Switzers took it from Sigi&s;mund, arch|duke of Au&s;tria, in the year 1460. The eight old cantons, viz. Zurich, Bern, Lucern, Uri, Schweiz, Underwald, Zug, and Glaris, who are &s;overeigns of it, alternately appoint a bailiff every two years: but a great part of it is immediately &s;ubject to certain lords, &s;piritual or temporal, par|ticularly the bi&s;hop and chapter of Con&s;tance, and the abbot of St. Gall. The places of mo&s;t note in it are,</P>

<HEAD>The Bailiwic of the RHEINTHAL.</HEAD>
<P>This bailiwic has its name from its &s;ituation along the Rhine, by which it is bounded to the ea&s;t.

It is well watered by three navigable rivers, the Limmat, the Reu&s;z, and the Aar, which abound with fi&s;h. The can|tons of Bern and Zurich appoint a bailiff &s;ucce&s;|&s;ively, each for &s;even years, and then Glaris, for two. Places of any note in the county are,</P>

In Latin it is called Ca&s;tellum or Vicus Thermarum, Aquae Helveticae, Thermopolis, Thermae Helveticae, Bada, Badena, Badenia, all which names, as well as its origin and increa&s;e, it owes to the warm-baths, for which it was famous, according to Tacitus, long before his time. They lie a little out of the town, on both &s;ides of the Limnat, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed by the names of the great and &s;mall baths. The waters are hot in the third degree, being &s;trongly impregnated with &s;ul|phur, and a mixture of alum and nitre. They are u&s;ed for many di&s;tempers, particularly &s;terility in wo|men, either by bathing or drinking. Here are al&s;o two ca&s;tles, an old and a new, the latter of which is the re&s;idence of the bailiff; a bridge over the river, but without rails; a council-hou&s;e, in which the ge|neral a&s;&s;emblies of the cantons are &s;ometimes held; with &s;everal churches and convents; the inhabi|tants being partly prote&s;tants, and partly papi&s;ts.

In the&s;e his territories he has the di&s;po&s;al of all benefices, and the nomi|nation of all judges and officers, and, it is &s;aid, can rai&s;e five or &s;ix thou&s;and men.

It came to the abbey of St. Gall, by purcha&s;e, in the year 1468. In the beginning of the eighteenth century, the inhabitants, to deliver them&s;elves from the exactions and op|pre&s;&s;ions of the abbot Leodger, the &s;on of a &s;hoe-maker, took up arms, which, at la&s;t, drew on a war, in which the cantons of Zurich and Bern &s;ided with the county, and tho&s;e of Schweiz and Glaris with the abbot; but the prote&s;tant cantons having gained two battles, the abbot, in 1718, was fain to come to an accommodation, by which the liberties of the Toggenburgers were &s;o|lemnly confirmed. All fines and forfeitures be|long to the abbot, who appoints mo&s;t of the judges and officers; but there is a council nomi|nated by the people, for the maintenance of their liberties, and for impo&s;ing and levying taxes, and other purpo&s;es. One half al&s;o of the judges, in the lower courts, are nominated by the county pari&s;hes. The only religions tolerated are the po|pi&s;h and Calvini&s;m; the profe&s;&s;ors of which are en|titled to an equal &s;hare in all offices, courts, and councils. Lichten&s;teig, a &s;mall town on the river Thur, is the capital of the county.</P>

<HEAD>The Town of ST. GALL.</HEAD>
<P>St. Gall is a fine large town, in the Upper Thurgau, near the river Steinach, &s;ix miles from the lake, and thirteen from the city of Con&s;tance. It owed its origin to the abbey; but the inhabitants are now Calvini&s;ts. Here are &s;everal churches, with a gymna&s;ium, in which is the city-library, a town-hou&s;e, alms-hou&s;e, and ar&s;enal. Though the territory belonging to the town is barren, the inhabitants are generally rich, and live at their ea&s;e, having a great trade in linen, with eight bleaching|grounds, and &s;everal fulling-mills along the river Sittern; be&s;ides, the town is a great thorough|fare betwixt Germany and Italy. Its &s;ituation near the lake al&s;o is very advantageous to it, and tho' it was formerly &s;ubject to the abbot, yet it is now a republic, and &s;ends deputies to the general diet; but the government is ari&s;tocratical. Here are &s;e|ven companies of citizens, one of which con&s;i&s;ts of gentlemen and traders of good families; two councils, a greater and le&s;&s;er; three burgoma&s;ters, and other officers, and &s;everal courts of ju&s;tice. Be&s;ides the burghers, who are well di&s;ciplined, there is a company of matro&s;&s;es and bombardiers, one of light infantry, two of granadiers, and a troop of hor&s;e. In 1454 it entered into a perpetual al|liance with the cantons of Zurich, Bern, Lucern, Schweiz, Zug, and Glaris. The precinct depen|dent on the town is &s;mall, but it has a lord&s;hip in the landgravate of the Thurgau, over which it ap|points a bailiff every &s;ixth year.</P>

<HEAD>The GRISON LEAGUES.</HEAD>
<P>The country of the Gri&s;ons is bounded on the north by the counties of Surgans and Blu|denz, the canton of Glaris, and the principa|lity of Lichten&s;tein; on the &s;outh by the cantons Italian bailiwics, the county of Chavenne, and the Valteline; on the ea&s;t by the territories of Venice and Milan; and on the we&s;t by &s;ome of the Italian bailiwics, and the canton of Uri. It is divided in|to three leagues, viz. the Gri&s;on or Grey league, the league of the hou&s;e of God, and that of the ten Juri&s;dictions. The two fir&s;t lie towards the &s;outh, and the third towards the north. The length of the whole is above &s;eventy miles, and the breadth about &s;ixty. The inhabitants are &s;aid to have had the name of Gri&s;ons from the grey coats they wore in former times. This country, lying among the Alps, is very mountainous; but the mountains yield good pa&s;ture for cattle, &s;heep, and goats, with &s;ome rye and barley: in the vallies there is plenty of grain, pul&s;e, fruits, and wine, with mineral &s;prings; good hay al&s;o is made there. This country al&s;o abounds with hogs and wild fowl; but there is a &s;carcity of fi&s;h and &s;alt, and their hor&s;es are mo&s;tly purcha&s;ed of foreigners. The principal rivers are the Rhine, the Inn, and the Adda. Here are al&s;o &s;everal lakes, mo&s;t of
<PB N="431" REF="4350">
which lie on the tops of the hills. The language of the Gri&s;ons is either a corrupt Italian, or the German. About two-thirds of the inhabitants are Calvini&s;ts, and the re&s;t papi&s;ts; the latter of whom in &s;pirituals, are under the bi&s;hop of Coire, ex|cept a few that are in the dioce&s;e of Como. Each of the leagues is &s;ubdivided into &s;everal le&s;&s;er com|munities, which are &s;o many democracies, every male, above &s;ixteen, having a &s;hare in the go|vernment of the community, and a vote in the election of magi&s;trates. Deputies from the &s;eve|ral communities con&s;titute the general diet of the Gri&s;on leagues, which meets annually, and alter|nately, at the capital of each league; but they can conclude nothing without the con&s;ent of their con|&s;tituents. This country was antiently a part of Rhetia. After the extinction of the Roman em|pire in the we&s;t, it was &s;ometime &s;ubject to its own dukes, or tho&s;e of Swabia. Then the bi&s;hop of Coire, and other petty princes, dependent on the emperors of Germany, became ma&s;ters of great part of it: at la&s;t, by the extinction of its lords, purcha&s;e voluntary grants, and force the Refor|mation, it got rid of all its lords, and erected it&s;elf into three di&s;tinct republics, each of which, as we ob&s;erved already, are &s;ubdivided into a certain number of communities, which are a &s;ort of re|publics, exerci&s;ing every branch of &s;overeignty, except that of making peace or war, &s;ending em|ba&s;&s;ies, concluding alliances, and enacting laws relating to the whole country, which belong to the provincial diets of the &s;everal leagues. The communities may be compared to the cities of Holland, and the diets of the &s;everal leagues to the provincial &s;tates. The particular diets are com|po&s;ed of a deputy from each community; and both in them, and the communities, every thing is determined by a majority of votes. In the com|munities
<PB N="432" REF="4360">
every male, above &s;ixteen, has a vote. Be&s;ides the annual provincial diets for chu&s;ing the chiefs, and other officers, and deliberating on the affairs of the re&s;pective leagues, there are general diets for what concerns all the three leagues, or whole body. In both the&s;e, the repre&s;entatives can do nothing of them&s;elves, but are tied down to the in&s;tructions of their principals: however, as all re&s;olutions are decided by the plurality of votes, and as the prote&s;tants are at lea&s;t two-thirds of the people, this republic may be deemed a pro|te&s;tant &s;tate. There is a general &s;eal for all the three leagues; and each particular league has a &s;eparate &s;eal. Be&s;ides the &s;tated times of meeting, extraordinary diets are &s;ometimes &s;ummoned, when either the dome&s;tic affairs of the &s;tate, or any fo|reign mini&s;ter require it. In the general diets, the Grey league has twenty-eight votes, that of the hou&s;e of God twenty-three, and that of the Ten Juri&s;dictions fifteen. The&s;e leagues, at different times, have entered into clo&s;e alliances with the neighbouring cantons, and their a&s;&s;ociates. The bailiwics belonging in common to the three leagues are tho&s;e of the Valteline, Chieavene, Bormio, Meyenfeld, Malans, and Jennins; the officers of which are nominated &s;ucce&s;&s;ively by the &s;everal communities, every two years. The yearly re|venue ari&s;ing to the Gri&s;ons from their bailiwics is &s;aid to amount to about thirteen thou&s;and five hun|dred florins. The public revenues altogether are but &s;mall, though there are many private per|&s;ons in the country that are rich. However, in ca&s;e of any extraordinary emergency, they tax them&s;elves in proportion to the nece&s;&s;ity of the &s;er|vice, and the people's abilities. They have no re|gular troops, but a well di&s;ciplined militia, and upon occa&s;ion, it is &s;aid, can bring a body of thirty thou&s;and fighting men into the field: but their

<HEAD>The LEAGUE of the HOUSE of GOD.</HEAD>
<P>This league is thought to derive its name from the cathedral of the bi&s;hopric of Chur, which &s;tands in it. It is upwards of eighty miles in length, and &s;ixty in breadth where wide&s;t, and contains &s;ome very high mountains. The chief of this league has the title of pre&s;ident, and like tho&s;e of the others, is elected annually. Its diet is held at the &s;ame time and place as the general diet, namely, at Coire, and, in both, it has twenty-three votes. It lies in the &s;outh-ea&s;t part of the Gri&s;ons country, and is divided into two great communi|ties, and the&s;e again into twenty-one &s;maller, called juri&s;dictions; the inhabitants of which are mo&s;tly prote&s;tants. About Coire, and the banks of the Rhine, they have fruit of all &s;orts, except oranges and olives. The number of the inhabitants is &s;aid to be about forty thou&s;and, of which &s;even or eight thou&s;and are fit to bear arms. Places of mo&s;t note in this league are,</P>
<P>Coire, or Chur, the capital not only of the league, but of the whole republic. It is called in Latin Curia Rhetorum, and &s;tands on the river Ple&s;&s;ur, which a little below falls into the Rhine, where that river begins to be navigable, and con&s;e|quently of great &s;ervice to the trade of the place. The neighbourhood of the town is beautifully di|ver&s;ified with hills, plains, vineyards, corn-fields, and orchards. The inhabitants are all Calvini&s;ts. The town is very populous, and pretty large, con|taining &s;everal churches, with the ar&s;enal, and re|cord office of the whole republic, a college be|longing in common to the three leagues, a gram|mar-&s;chool,
<PB N="435" REF="4390">
a granary, and a town-hou&s;e, in which is held, once in three years, the general diet, and al&s;o the extraordinary diets, and the congre&s;&s;es. It has al&s;o, from time immemorial, been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the right of coinage. The bi&s;hopric, to which it gives name, is very antient, and, before the Re|formation, had great power, and a large revenue annexed to it. The bi&s;hop has &s;till a revenue of upwards of a thou&s;and pounds &s;terling, and is a prince of the empire, though he furni&s;hes no con|tingent. According to the rights and privileges claimed by this league, no bi&s;hop ought to be cho&s;en, nor any of the epi&s;copal effects and po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ions allienated, without its con&s;ent and appro|bation, nor any employments dependent on the &s;ee conferred on any but members of the league; yet tho&s;e claims have not of late been much re|garded by the bi&s;hop and chapter. For the government of the city, there is a greater and le&s;&s;er council, be&s;ides &s;everal courts of ju&s;tice, bur|goma&s;ters, and other officers. The bi&s;hop, in &s;pi|rituals, is &s;ubject to the archbi&s;hop of Mentz. His chapter con&s;i&s;ts of twenty-four canons, but of the&s;e only &s;ix have &s;alaries, who live together with the bi&s;hop on an eminence ju&s;t without the city of Coire, called the Hoff, which is enclo&s;ed with walls and gates, and in which al&s;o &s;tands the cathedral. The bi&s;hop has e&s;tates and incomes, not only among the Gri&s;ons, but el&s;ewhere, par|ticularly in Tyrol. The greater part of the inha|bitants of his dioce&s;e are now prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>Po&s;chiavo, a hand&s;ome town, which gives name to a plea&s;ant valley, lying between high mountains, and containing a lake. The road to and from the Valteline and Engaden pa&s;&s;ing through it, occa&s;i|ons a great deal of bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>The valley of Engaden, in this league, is di|vided into the upper and lower, being large and

<HEAD>The League of the TEN JURISDICTIONS.</HEAD>
<P>This is the &s;malle&s;t of the three, is divided into &s;even great communities, out which the chief is annually cho&s;en by turns. To make up the ten juri&s;dictions, Dr. Burnet &s;ays, that three of the great communities are &s;ubdivided each into two juri&s;dictions. In the general diet this league has fifteen votes. It purcha&s;ed for it&s;elf, in the year 1649, all the prerogatives which the hou&s;e of Au|&s;tria was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of in the country. The greater part of the inhabitants are prote&s;tants; and the language of all, except a village or two, is Ger|man. The public is very poor, though particular per&s;ons are generally very rich. The country is about twenty-five miles in length, and the &s;ame in breadth, and con&s;i&s;ts, for the mo&s;t part, of rugged de&s;ert mountains, yielding neither corn nor fruit, except on the banks of the Rhine, and a few other places, but abounding in hor&s;es, cattle, fi&s;h, milk, butter, and che&s;e, of all which there is a con&s;idera|ble exportation. Bleau reckoned the men about fifteen thou&s;and, of whom four thou&s;and were fit to bear arms. In the community of Davos are &s;aid to be mines of &s;ilver, lead, and copper, but none of them are wrought. In the great church of the &s;ame community is held the general diet every
<PB N="437" REF="4410">
three years, and there al&s;o the archives and ban|ners of the league are kept. In the community of Ca&s;tels, and others, are mineral waters and baths. The only town in the league is that of</P>
<P>Mayenfeld, which gives name to a great com|munity, and contains a large warehou&s;e for mer|chandize, going to or from Italy by the way of St. Lucius Steig, which is a very narrow pa&s;s, leading from the country of the Gri&s;ons into Germany. The di&s;trict of Mayenfeld belongs to all the three leagues, having been purcha&s;ed by them in common, and produces a pretty good wine.</P>
<P>Malix is a large parochial village, in the com|munity of Churwalden.</P>

<HEAD>The countries or territories &s;ubject to the three GRISONS leagues lie at the foot of the ALPS, near the entrance of Italy, and con&s;i&s;t of the Valteline, and the counties of Bormio and Chiavenna.</HEAD>
<P>The Valteline, in Latin, Vallis Tellina, is upwards of thirty miles in length, and from eight to twenty in breadth. It is exceeding fruit|ful and plea&s;ant, being watered by the Adda, which abounds with fi&s;h, &s;creened from the northern bla&s;ts by high mountains, and beautifully inter|&s;per&s;ed with corn-fields, meadows, vineyards, che&s;nut, and other fruit trees. There is a red wine produced here, of a mo&s;t delicious flavour, and &s;o &s;trong a body, that it will keep a whole cen|tury, improving both in ta&s;te and whole&s;omene&s;s, and gradually turning paler, till at length its red|ne&s;s totally di&s;appears. The culture of &s;ilk and wine cheifly engro&s;&s;ing the attention of the inha|bitants, grazery is too much neglected, and even a part of the corn con&s;umed in the country is im|ported. Here are &s;everal baths and mineral waters,
<PB N="438" REF="4420">
with &s;ome iron works. So fertile is the country, where duly cultivated, that they have &s;ometimes three crops in a year; the fir&s;t of wheat, the &s;econd of millet, and the third of turnips, or other garden|&s;tuff. The &s;trength of the wine is in a great mea|&s;ure owing to the &s;ituation of the mountains, which running ea&s;t and we&s;t, the vineyards have the be|nefit of the &s;un the whole day. The trouts of the Adda are fat and delicious, and &s;o large, that they weigh from fifty to &s;ixty pounds. The language of the country is a corrupt Italian, and the religion popery; there were formerly many prote&s;tants here, but they were all ma&s;&s;acred, in the year 1620, without regard to age, &s;ex, or quality. This country, as well as tho&s;e of Bormio and Chia|venna, belonged antiently to the &s;ee of Chur; but having been wre&s;ted from it by the dukes of Milan, and recovered again with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the three leagues, the bi&s;hop, in 1530, transferred all the rights of his &s;ee to the leagues, on condition, that every two years, five hundred and &s;eventy-three florins &s;hould be paid to the bi&s;hop for the time, being out of the cu&s;toms levied at Chiavanna. The principal officers in the Valteline are appointed every two years by the Gri&s;ons. Every two years al&s;o, each league &s;ends three deputies, with two clerks and a lawyer, to hear the complaints of the people again&s;t the officers &s;et over them, and to redre&s;s their grievances. The inhabitants are po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of particular privileges, and have the choice of certain officers. The name of the county is de|rived from the village of Tell, &s;ituated on the top of a hill. There are ve&s;&s;els u&s;ed in the kitchens here and almo&s;t all over Lombardy, made of a &s;tone called lovege, which feels oily and &s;caly, and is &s;omewhat of the nature of &s;late. This &s;tone is dug out of three mines, one near Chiavenna, another in this country, and a third in that of the Gri&s;ons.
<PB N="439" REF="4430">
Dr. Burnet &s;ays, that the pots made of this &s;tone boil meat &s;ooner than tho&s;e of metal, though their bottoms are twice as thick at the other. The pa&s;|&s;age into the mine here is not above three feet wide, for near half a mile, through a rock; &s;o that they who draw out the &s;tones creep all along on their bellies, having a candle fa&s;tened to their foreheads, and the &s;tone laid on a &s;ort of cu&s;hion made for it on their hips. This country is defended by mountains, through which there are narrow pa&s;&s;es, where a few men may with&s;tand great armies. Bleau computed the inhabitants at about twenty-five thou&s;and, of which four thou&s;and were fit to bear arms. Their chief trade is in wine, cattle, hides, tallow, butter, and chee&s;e. Travellers ob|&s;erve, that there is &s;carce a people upon earth that live under a milder government, and enjoy greater privileges, than tho&s;e of the Valteline. It is a plea&s;ant valley, &s;tretched out between the lake of Como on the we&s;t, and Tyrol on the ea&s;t, with the country of the Gri&s;ons on the north, and the dominions of Venice on the &s;outh; and is divided into three terzeros, or thirds, which are &s;ubdi|vided into communities. The principal places in it are,</P>

<HEAD>The Country of BORMIO, called by the Ger|mans WORMS.</HEAD>
<P>This country is environed on all &s;ides by high mountains, of which there are al&s;o many within it. The air is pure and healthy, and the &s;oil, though it yields no wine, and little fruit, yet is fruitful in corn, honey, iron ore, and rich pa&s;tures, which feed great numbers of cows, &s;heep, and goats. The Adda has its &s;ource in this country. The inhabitants are all papi&s;ts, and amount to about fourteen thou&s;and. They have a governor, ap|pointed by the Gri&s;ons, and &s;tiled a pode&s;tat; but enjoy all their antient rights and privileges. The only place in the country of any note is that from which it takes its name, which &s;tands near the Adda, twenty-two miles from Sondrio, forty from Chiavenna, and fifty from Coire. It is the re&s;i|dence of the governor, &s;ent hither every two years from the Gri&s;ons, and is a pretty large populous place. One of the vales here is called Maglia Vaccha, or Eat Cow, from the many cows killed in it by falls from the neighbouring mountains; and another is &s;tiled the Freel Valley, in Latin Vallis Fera, or Ferrea, from the iron-ore, &s;melting hou&s;es, and forges in it.

<P>Halden&s;tein is a free independent barony, about three miles below Chur, on the Rhine. It is under the protection of the Gri&s;on Leagues, and takes its name from the village of Halden&s;tein, which has a palace in it, and a &s;mall ca&s;tle above it. For the protection granted it by the Gri&s;ons, it is obliged, when required, to furni&s;h them a certain number of men. The inhabitants are Calvini&s;ts. Its lord, &s;tiled baron of Halden&s;tein and Lichten&s;tein, has all the prerogatives of a &s;overeign within the barony, together with the great and &s;mall tythes, the pa|tronage of the churches, &amp;c. Until the year 1701 the inhabitants were under villenage, but were then relea&s;ed from it. Out of three per&s;ons recommended by the va&s;&s;als, the baron nominates one for judge.</P>

<HEAD>VALAIS.</HEAD>
<P>Another ally of the Swi&s;s cantons is the county of Valais, by the Switzers called Wallis, and in Latin Vale&s;ia. It is a valley among the Alps, hav|ing Swi&s;&s;erland on the north and ea&s;t, the Milane&s;e and the duchy of Ao&s;ta on the &s;outh, and Savoy on the we&s;t, extending near an hundred miles in length, from ea&s;t to we&s;t, and about thirty in breadth, be|tween high mountains. It is exceeding fertile, yielding wheat, barley, rye, wine, &s;affron, apples, pears, plumbs, cherries, che&s;nuts, mulberries, &s;mall nuts, and, in &s;ome places, almonds, figs, pomegra|nates, and other fine fruits. It abounds al&s;o in cat|tle, game, and veni&s;on, has &s;ome hot baths and pits of coal, and is well watered by the Rhone, which traver&s;es it from ea&s;t to we&s;t. A great part of it formerly belonged to the bi&s;hop of Sion, who &s;till
<PB N="443" REF="4470">
pre&s;ides in the councils of the commonwealth, and has great influence in the management of their af|fairs. Not only the German, French, and Italian, but even the Latin is &s;poken here, and that too by the common people, though very corruptly. The Valais is entirely popi&s;h, forming the dioce&s;e of Sion; and is divided into the Upper and Lower. The Upper, in the year 1475, having made a conque&s;t of the Lower, the latter has ever &s;ince been &s;ubject to the former, though not without many privileges. A diet is held twice a-year, to which the &s;even communities, or tithings of Upper-Valais, &s;end deputies. The government, excepting that of the Sion, which is ari&s;tocratical, is much the &s;ame as that of the Gri&s;ons. Mo&s;t of the in|habitants, we are told, have large wens, and are of a very diminutive &s;ize. The country is very popu|lous, and contains thirty five pari&s;hes. The har|ve&s;t generally begins in May in the vallies, but is not over on the mountains till October. Two &s;orts of cry&s;tal are found in the Valais, one very fine and clear, and the other du&s;ki&s;h, or of a violet colour. Their woods abound with larch trees, which fur|ni&s;h them with rozin and agaric. The air, though very hot in the vallies in &s;ummer, is &s;o pure, that tho&s;e who are temperate live to a great age. Mo&s;t of the hou&s;es are of wood, e&s;pecially of that of the larch tree, which is very durable, and grows at la&s;t as black as ebony. The chief places in the Upper-Valais are,</P>
<P>Sitten, in French Sion, the capital of the whole Valais, &s;tanding not far from the Rhine, on the river Sitten, from which it takes its name. It contains &s;everal churches and convents, and is the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who has no le&s;s than three palaces in the town, and &s;tiles him&s;elf count and prefect of the Valais. He is cho&s;en by the chapter, and the repre&s;entatives of the &s;even tithings, and is &s;ubject
<PB N="444" REF="4480">
in &s;pirituals to the archbi&s;hop of Mou&s;tiers, in Sa|voy. The bi&s;hopric is very antient. The town is twenty miles from the lake, and fifty-four from the city of Geneva, eighty-five from Milan, and fifty from Bern.</P>
<P>Brug or Brig, which before the year 1755, when the greate&s;t part of it was de&s;troyed by an earthquake, was accounted the hand&s;ome&s;t place in the whole Valais. It &s;tands on the river Sal|tana, not far from the Rhone, twelve miles &s;outh|ea&s;t of Sion. About three miles from it, and clo&s;e by the Rhone, is a warm bath, of great virtue.</P>

<P>Extend from north-ea&s;t to &s;outh-we&s;t, be|tween the Franche Comt&eacute; and the lakes of Neuf|chatel and Biel, being about thirty miles in length, and fifteen in breadth. The lower parts of them yield wine, fruits, corn, hemp, and flax, and tho&s;e which lie on Mount Jura afford not only pa&s;ture for &s;heep and cattle, and woods, abounding with
<PB N="446" REF="4500">
deer and other game, but al&s;o metals, marble, pe|trefactions, and chalk-pits. Here are al&s;o &s;ome celebrated mineral waters. The country is very populous, and the greate&s;t part of the inhabitants are prote&s;tants. The current language is the French, but none of the pure&s;t, nor &s;poken with the true accent. Mary, duche&s;s of Nemours, dy|ing in 1707, &s;everal illu&s;trious families put in their claims to the&s;e territories; but the high tribunal of Neufchatel, after a mature and impartial exami|nation of the &s;everal claims, pa&s;&s;ed a decree in fa|vour of the king of Pru&s;&s;ia, on the third of No|vember 1707, who immediately took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the principality, confirming to the inhabitants all their liberties and privileges, together with their alliances and communiy of rights with the can|tons. Though the king &s;tiles him&s;elf &s;overeign prince of Neufchatel and Valangin, yet his autho|rity is pretty much limited by the privileges of the people; his edicts being of no force until they are confirmed by the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates. The ordinary admini&s;tration of affairs is ve&s;ted in the governor and council, appointed by the king. The revenue of the principality amounts to about forty thou&s;and florins per annum, and its militia to between eight and nine thou&s;and men. This country is called the key of Switzerland, on account of &s;ix pa&s;&s;es, which lead from the former into the latter, and may be defended by a handful of men again&s;t the greate&s;t armies. The only places worth notice in it are,</P>
<P>Neufchatel, which gives name to it, and is its capital, being &s;tiled in Latin Neocomum, Novi|ca&s;trum, or Neoburgum, and in German Neuen|burg and Wel&s;ch-Neuenburg. It &s;tands on the &s;ide of the lake, which takes its name from it, about twenty-&s;even miles long, and &s;ix broad,
<PB N="447" REF="4510">
and abounding in fi&s;h, but not very deep. The town, which is pretty large and tolerably well built, is commanded by a huge old ca&s;tle on a hill, in which the governor re&s;ides. Its neigh|bourhood is adorned with vineyards, gardens, and &s;eats, and it enjoys great privileges, being ex|empted, in particular, from all impo&s;ts and tithes. It is &s;aid to have been built by the emperor Con|rade, in 1034. In 1406 its fir&s;t alliance was con|cluded with Bern, which hath been frequently re|newed &s;ince that time; and, in 1530, it embraced the Reformation.</P>
<P>Landeron, a town &s;eated at the influx of the Zil or Thielle into the Biel lake.</P>
<P>Boudry, a &s;mall town, which, as well as the former, gives name to a di&s;trict.</P>
<P>Valangin, a &s;mall town and ca&s;tle at the foot of Mount Jura, which gives name to the county. In one of the &s;ummits of Mount Jura, in this county, near a village called La Cote aux Fees, is to be &s;een a very &s;uperb Pagan temple, hewn out of a rock, in which Mercury was con&s;ulted by means of certain prophete&s;&s;es, called in French Fees.</P>

<DIV4>
<HEAD>The City of GENEVA.</HEAD>
<P>The republic of Geneva con&s;i&s;ts of the city and a &s;mall territory. The city, called in Latin al&s;o Geneva, but in German Genf, and in French Ge|nev&eacute;, is &s;ituated where the Rhone makes its exit from the lake, &s;ixty-five miles from Bern, &s;eventy-five from Lyons, and an hundred and &s;ix from Turin. A part of it &s;tands on an i&s;land in the Rhone, and part on the banks on both &s;ides, being a hand&s;ome well fortified city, and pretty large. In &s;ome of the &s;treets are arched walks or piazzas. The Treille is a mo&s;t charming place, planted with linden trees, and commanding a fine pro&s;pect
<PB N="448" REF="4520">
of the lake, and of &s;everal ranges of mountains and rocks, ri&s;ing behind one another; &s;ome co|vered with vineyards and herbage, and others with &s;now, with openings betwixt them. Immediately below the city the Rhone is joined by the Arve. Over the former of the&s;e rivers are four bridges. The inhabitants of Geneva are mo&s;tly Calvini&s;ts. Of the &s;ix churches, the cathedral of St. Peter is the principal, in which is a monument to the memory of Henry duke of Rohan. The &s;ervice in &s;ome of the&s;e churches is in French, in others in Italian, and in others in German. The guildhall is a &s;tately free|&s;tone edifice, &s;ituated on an eminence, the a&s;cent to which is without any &s;teps, &s;o that a per&s;on may not only walk, but ride from the top to the bot|tom. Here is an ar&s;enal, which is &s;aid to contain arms for twelve thou&s;and men; and an univer&s;ity, which has twelve profe&s;&s;ors belonging to it, with a very valuable library. Several learned men have either been natives, or profe&s;&s;ors and mini&s;ters of this city; particularly Calvin, Theodore Beza, the Diodati, the Turretines, the late Mr. Le Clerc, and others. As the quantity of corn produced in the territory of the city is not &s;ufficient for the con&s;umption of the inhabitants, the republic has erected large granaries, which always contain a quantity &s;ufficient to &s;upply the inhabitants two years. The bakers, the inn-keepers, the garri&s;on, and the artificers employed by the city, are obliged to take what corn they want from the&s;e granaries, at a &s;mall advance of the prime co&s;t. Be&s;ides the re|venue ari&s;ing from hence, the city has other in|comes, amounting to about an hundred and thirty thou&s;and dollars, with part of which it maintains a garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ting of eight hundred men, well di&s;|ciplined, and cloathed in a blue uniform, turned up with red. The environs of the city are ex|tremely plea&s;ant, which, with the goodne&s;s of the
<PB N="449" REF="4530">
air and provi&s;ions, the mildne&s;s of the govern|ment, the politene&s;s of the inhabitants, the num|bers of foreign gentlemen always re&s;iding here, or pa&s;&s;ing from France, Germany, and other countries to the north of the Alps, to Italy, and others lying &s;outh of them, render it a mo&s;t agree|able place: hence Mr Addi&s;on &s;tiled it, very ju&s;t|ly, the court of the Alps. In all the &s;treets are fountains and canals to &s;upply the inhabitants with water, which is rai&s;ed by engines from the Rhone. The trade of the city is very con&s;iderable, it being a great thoroughfare, and having a variety of ma|nufactures, with a number of indu&s;trious and in|genious artificers, particularly in the watch-making branch. The library belonging to the city is well furni&s;hed with excellent books, be&s;ides a curious collection of medals and petrefactions, and &s;ome antient manu&s;cripts. They are not &s;o rigid in keeping the &s;abbath here as the Calvini&s;ts in Eng|land and Scotland; for they tolerate, and even au|thorize, all manner of manly exerci&s;es on Sundays, after divine &s;ervice; and then it is that the militia al&s;o are exerci&s;ed. The &s;un ri&s;es later here, and &s;ets &s;ooner, than in mo&s;t other places of the &s;ame latitude, which is owing to the Alps. Mr. Addi&s;on &s;ays, that there are merchants in Geneva that are reckoned worth two millions of crowns, though, perhaps, not one of them &s;pends five hundred pounds a-year. At the general ho&s;pital, be&s;ides the city poor, poor travellers are maintained for one day, and then di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed, with &s;ome money in their pockets, to pro|ceed on their journey. As to the government, it is much like that of Zurich and Bern. The number of burghers is about fifteen hundred, and the prin|cipal magi&s;trates are the four &s;yndics. There are no le&s;s than four councils, viz. the general council of the citizens and burghers, the council of two hundred, that of &s;ixty, and that of twenty-five.
<PB N="450" REF="4540">
Of the la&s;t, two per&s;ons of the &s;ame family cannot be members at the &s;ame time. A &s;on here, who refu&s;es to pay his father's debts, is incapable of any office in the &s;tate. No marriages are permit|ted unle&s;s both parties are of the prote&s;tant reli|gion. A woman of forty years of age mu&s;t not marry a man of le&s;s than thirty; if &s;he exceed forty, her hu&s;band mu&s;t at lea&s;t be thirty-five: nor mu&s;t a man above &s;ixty marry a woman who is not, at lea&s;t, thirty. A widow mu&s;t not alter her condi|tion in le&s;s than &s;ix months after her hu&s;band's de|cea&s;e. The kings of France and England are con|&s;tantly mentioned in their public prayers here. It is &s;aid that Calvin lies buried in that part of the church-yard called the Plain-palais; but the parti|cular &s;pot is either not known, or pretended not to be known. Before the Reformation, this city was the &s;ee of a bi&s;hop, who was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the &s;o|vereignty thereof at fir&s;t, jointly with its counts, and afterwards with the dukes of Savoy; but it got rid of both, about the period above-mentioned, and entered into alliance with &s;everal of the can|tons: at pre&s;ent, however, tho&s;e only with Bern and Zurich continue in force. The king of France always keeps a re&s;ident here. So much are the magi&s;tracy afraid of opening a door to luxury and licentiou&s;ne&s;s, that no theatre is per|mitted in the city. The lake, to which it gives name, re&s;embles a half-moon, who&s;e convex &s;ide lies towards Switzerland. On that &s;ide it extends eighteen leagues, reckoning along the &s;hore, but on the Savoy &s;ide not above twelve; and its great|e&s;t breadth is upwards of &s;even. As for its depth, in &s;ome places it is &s;aid to be unfathomable. Con|trary to mo&s;t other lakes, it decrea&s;es in winter, and increa&s;es in &s;ummer, which is owing to the melting of the &s;now on the neighbouring moun|$ans. It is hardly ever frozen over, and has the ter|ritories
<PB N="451" REF="4550">
of no le&s;s than five different &s;tates border|ing on it, viz. the kingdom of France, the duchy of Savoy, the canton of Bern, the bi&s;hopric of Sion, and the republic of Geneva.</P>
<P>The bi&s;hop of Ba&s;il is al&s;o in alliance with the &s;even popi&s;h cantons, on account of a part of his territories which, having embraced the prote&s;tant religion, detached it&s;elf from the empire, and made an alliance with &s;ome of the cantons, though it &s;till acknowledges the bi&s;hop as &s;overeign. In this part the principal places are, Biel, which we have given &s;ome account of already, and which is in al|liance with Bern, Freyberg, and Solothurn; and Neuen&s;tadt, a &s;mall town on the Biel lake, in al|liance with Bern, where is a ca&s;tle, which is the re&s;idence of the bi&s;hop's ca&s;tellan.</P>

<P>A great part of them being &s;urrounded by the &s;ea, lying low, and abounding in mar&s;hes, the air, in con&s;equence thereof, is damp and unwhole&s;ome, rains and fogs frequent, and the gout, &s;curvy, rheumati&s;m, and agues, both rife and inveterate. The effects of human indu&s;try here are wonderful in the dykes and dams erected for defending the country again&s;t the inundations of the &s;ea, and in the ditches, canals, mills, and &s;luices, for draining the mar&s;hes. The quantity of grain produced here is not &s;uffi|cient for home con&s;umption; but the pa&s;tures in the mar&s;hes are &s;o rich, that they can &s;pare a great deal of butter and chee&s;e for exportation. They have al&s;o a good breed of &s;heep, who&s;e wool is highly valued, with turf, madder, tobacco, &s;ome fruit, and iron; but all the pit-coal and timber u&s;ed in it, and indeed mo&s;t of the comforts, and even the nece&s;&s;aries of life, are imported. All the provinces either lie upon, or communicate with the North-&s;ea, by means of that called the Zuyder, or South-&s;ea, which was formed partly

by the Rhine's right branch, then increa&s;ed by the Vecht, which has now another outlet, over-flow|ing the low &s;wampy grounds through which it pa&s;&s;ed, and partly by the &s;ea's breaking in, in the thirteenth century, and overflowing a large tract of ground contiguous to that before laid under water by the Rhine. The principal rivers are, the Rhine, the Maes, the Scheld, and the Vecht. The fir&s;t is divided into &s;everal branches, one of which joins the Old I&s;&s;el, and after that falls into the Zuyder-&s;ee; another named the Leck, at the village of Krimpen, mingles with the Maes; a third, called the Crooked Rhine, is branched out at Leyden into canals, of which one runs into the lake of Harlem, and another lo&s;es it&s;elf in the &s;and hills between Catwyk on the Rhine, and Catwyk on the &s;ea; and a fourth, called the Waal, falls into the Maes over-again&s;t Workum. The Maes, after dividing it&s;elf into two branches, and again uniting the&s;e, falls into the North-&s;ea, below Rotterdam. The Scheld below Antwerp divides it&s;elf into two branches, called the We&s;tern and Ea&s;tern Scheld; the fir&s;t &s;eparating Flanders from Zealand, and the other running north by Bergen-op-Zoom, and af|terwards ea&s;t, between the i&s;lands of Beveland and Schowen, falls into the &s;ea a little below. The Vecht runs from ea&s;t to we&s;t through the province of Overy&s;&s;el, and falls into the Zuyder-&s;ee. There are many &s;maller rivers that join the&s;e, and a va&s;t number of canals; yet there are few good harbours in the provinces. The be&s;t are tho&s;e of Rotterdam, Helvoet&s;luys, and Flu&s;hing. As to the harbour of Am&s;terdam, it is indeed one of the large&s;t and &s;afe&s;t in Europe; but there is a bar at the entrance of it, over which large ve&s;&s;els cannot pa&s;s, without being lightened, or unloaded. There are no mountains in the&s;e provinces; and the only lake, properly &s;o called, is that of Harlem. The provinces are ex|tremely

The towns are very agreeable, being kept very clean, and having canals in the middle of the &s;treets, planted with trees. The number of inhabitants is compu|ted at about two millions. The animals here are much the &s;ame as in England; but their hor&s;es and horned cattle are of a larger &s;ize. Storks build and hatch on their chimnies; but, being birds of pa&s;|&s;age, they leave the country about the middle of Augu&s;t, with their young, and return the February following.

A va&s;t variety of manu|factures are carried on in the provinces, and with extraordinary &s;kill and diligence; and a great num|ber of hands are employed, and much wealth ac|quired by the herring, cod, and whale fi&s;heries; though they are not &s;o con&s;iderable, or advantage|ous, as formerly. No nation has hitherto equalled them in the cure of herrings; tho&s;e cured at Gla&s;|gow, in Scotland, are thought to come the neare&s;t to them. About a hundred and fifty &s;ail are annu|ally employed in the whale fi&s;hery, and about two hundred in the herring. The profits of the latter, in a good year, after all deductions, are thought to amount to two millions of Holland guilders. The principal manufactures here are tho&s;e of linen, paper, and earthen-ware of all &s;orts. Ship build|ing al&s;o employs va&s;t numbers of hands. The trade of this country, however, upon the whole, is &s;aid to be upon the decline, owing partly to a decline of their antient par&s;imony and indu&s;try, but chiefly to the improvement of manufactures, trade, and navigation, in other, countries.</P>

<HEAD>COINS.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to the coin here, every province being a &s;overeignty of it&s;elf, has of cour&s;e the right of coinage; but all the pieces mu&s;t be of the
<PB N="457" REF="4610">
&s;ame intrin&s;ic value. The coins, real or imaginary, are a deut, worth about half a farthing; a grot Flemi&s;h, two farthings; a &s;tiver, equal to a penny Engli&s;h; a dubbelchin, to two pence; a &s;chilling, to &s;ix-pence; but there are &s;chillings worth only five pence half-penny; a guilder, to twenty pence; a gold guilder, to fifty-eight; a thaler, or dollar, to thirty; a rixthaler, or rixdollar, to fifty; a lowenthaler, or lion-dollar, to forty-two; a du|catoon, to &s;ixty-three. The gold ducat is worth about eight &s;hillings and eight pence; and the ruy|der is almo&s;t equal in value to a guinea. Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are half and three guilder pieces, and half and quarter rixdollars.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>CONSTITUTION and GOVERNMENT.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to the political con&s;titution, mo&s;t of the towns in the &s;everal provinces are little republics, who&s;e deputies, with the nobility, compo&s;e the &s;tates thereof; and the deputies of provinces, in like manner, compo&s;e the &s;tates-general. Every town or province may &s;end as many deputies as they plea&s;e to the a&s;&s;emblies of the provincial &s;tates, or &s;tates-general; but tho&s;e of each town or province have but one voice, and pre&s;ide by turns. No re&s;olution taken by the &s;tates-general is of any force, till it is confirmed by the &s;everal provinces. The legi&s;lative power in the towns is ve&s;ted in the &s;enates, and the executive in the burgoma&s;ters, &s;yndics, &amp;c. The &s;tates of the provinces are &s;tiled noble and mighty lords; but tho&s;e of Holland, noble and mo&s;t mighty lords; and the &s;tates-general, high and mighty lords, or the lords the &s;tates-general of the United-Netherlands, or their high mightine&s;&s;es. Be&s;ides the &s;tates-general, there is al&s;o a council of &s;tate, con&s;i&s;ting of deputies from the &s;everal provinces,
<PB N="458" REF="4620">
making twelve in all, of which Holland &s;ends three, Gelderland, Zealand, and Utrecht, two a|piece, and Frie&s;land, Groningen, and Overy&s;&s;el, one. In this council every deputy pre&s;ides a week by turns, and the &s;tadtholder has a deci&s;ive voice when the votes happen to be equal. The principal af|fairs that come under their deliberation, are tho&s;e relating to the army and finances. The &s;tadtholder is al&s;o pre&s;ident of the &s;tates in every province, but has no &s;eat in the &s;tates-general. One di&s;&s;enting voice in the provincial &s;tates prevents their coming to any re&s;olution. From the death of William III. prince of Orange and king of England, there had been no &s;tadtholder, at lea&s;t for the provinces of Holland, Zealand, and We&s;t-Frie&s;land; but the&s;e al&s;o, in 1747, upon the French breaking into Dutch Flanders, made choice of William-Charles-Henry-Fri&s;o, prince of Orange, and father of the pre&s;ent &s;tadtholder, William V. The &s;tadtholder&s;hip was at the &s;ame time made hereditary to his heirs male and female, provided the latter did not marry the &s;on of a king, or a papi&s;t. The &s;tadtholder's powers and prerogatives are very con&s;iderable: in particular, he &s;eems directly, or by his influence, to have the no|mination of the magi&s;trates, deputies, and mo&s;t of the officers, civil and military. In &s;hort, though he has not the title, he has more real power and authority than many kings; for be&s;ides the influence and revenue he derives from the &s;tadtholder&s;hip, he has &s;everal principalities, and large e&s;tates of his own. With re&s;pect to the admini&s;tration of ju&s;tice in this country, every province has its tribunal, to which, except in criminal cau&s;es, appeals lie from the petty and country courts; and it is &s;aid, that ju&s;tice is no where di&s;tributed with more im|partiality.</P>

<HEAD>TAXES and REVENUES.</HEAD>
<P>The taxes in the&s;e provinces are &s;o many, and &s;o heavy, e&s;pecially in Holland, that it is not with|out rea&s;on that a certain author a&s;&s;erts, that the only thing that has e&s;caped taxation there is the air they breathe. The ordinary revenues of the re|public are computed at between two and three mil|lions &s;terling annually. Out of a hundred guilders, the province of Holland contributes fifty-eight, and, con&s;equently, above one half of the whole pub|lic expences. For the encouragement of trade, the duties on goods and merchandize are &s;aid to be exceeding low. Notwith&s;tanding the number and greatne&s;s of the taxes, every province is &s;aid to labour under very heavy debts, e&s;pecially Hol|land, and the public credit is not in the mo&s;t flou|ri&s;hing condition.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>FORCES, by SEA and LAND.</HEAD>
<P>With re&s;pect to their land forces in time of peace, they &s;eldom exceed forty thou&s;and, and very often fall &s;hort of that number. They employ a great many foreigners, e&s;pecially Swi&s;s and Scots, in their &s;ervice; and, in time of war, hire whole regiments of Ger|mans. The chief command of the army is ve&s;ted in the &s;tadtholder, under whom is the field-mar&s;hal-general. In 1756 the expences of the army a|mounted only to nine million &s;even hundred and &s;ixty-five thou&s;and and four guilders. No nation in the world can fit out a more formidable fleet than the Dutch, having always va&s;t quantities of timber prepared for building of &s;hips, and &s;uch numbers of &s;hip-carpenters and mariners: howe|ver, in times of peace, they u&s;ually have no more than thirty in commi&s;&s;ion, for the protection of
<PB N="460" REF="4640">
their trade in the Mediterranean, and to convoy the homeward-bound Indiamen, &amp;c. Their navy is under the direction of the five admiralty col|leges, who, to defray the charges thereof, levy the duties on exports and imports.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>CHARACTER of the DUTCH.</HEAD>
<P>As to the character of the Dutch, the boors or hu&s;bandmen are indu&s;trious enough, but heavy, and &s;low of under&s;tanding. The &s;eamen are a plain, blunt, but rough, &s;urly, and ill-mannered &s;ort of people. Their trade&s;men are &s;omething &s;harper, and make u&s;e of all their &s;kill to take advantage of the ignorance of tho&s;e they deal with. Every cla&s;s of men are extremely frugal. All appetites and pa&s;&s;ions run lower and cooler here than in other countries, avarice excepted. Quarrels are very rare, revenge is &s;eldom heard of, and jealou&s;y &s;carcely ever known. It is very uncommon for any of them to be really in love, or even to pretend to it; nor do the women &s;eem to care whether they are or not. People conver&s;e pretty much upon a level here; nor is it ea&s;y to di&s;tingui&s;h the man from the ma&s;ter, nor the maid from the mi&s;tre&s;s, &s;uch liber|ties do they allow their &s;ervants, or rather are obliged to allow them, for they may not be &s;truck or corrected by them, but the di&s;pute mu&s;t be left to the magi&s;trate. The Dutch are tall and &s;trong|built; but both men and women have the gro&s;&s;e&s;t &s;hapes that are to be met with any where, or rather no &s;hape at all. Their garb, except among the of|ficers of the army and &s;ome few others, is exceed|ing plain, and the fa&s;hions change as &s;eldom as in Spain. The men are addicted to drinking, which &s;ome think nece&s;&s;ary in this foggy air, both for their health, and the improvement of their under&s;tandings. Among their diver&s;ions, that of
<PB N="461" REF="4650">
&s;kaiting in winter is one of the chief. It is amaz|ing to &s;ee the crowds in a hard fro&s;t upon the ice, and their great dexterity in &s;kaiting; both men and women darting along, or rather fly|ing, with inconceivable velocity. The Dutch are remarkable for their cleanline&s;s: nothing can ex|ceed the neatne&s;s of their hou&s;es, towns, and villages. Many of them have di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves by their learning, and &s;ome even by their wit and in|genuity, witne&s;s Era&s;mus, Grotius, &amp;c. The Dutch excel al&s;o in painting and engraving, and &s;ome of them have been no contemptible &s;tatuaries. In our particular de&s;cription of the &s;even provinces, we &s;hall begin with Gelderland, as the fir&s;t in rank.</P>
</DIV3>
<DIV3>
<HEAD>GELDERLAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province, (called North Gelderland, to di|&s;tingui&s;h it from Upper Gelderland, belonging to Pru&s;&s;ia) together with its appurtenance the county of Zutphen, is bounded to the we&s;t by Utrecht and Holland, on the ea&s;t by the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter and the duchy of Cleve, on the north by the Zuy|der-&s;ee and Overy&s;&s;el, and on the &s;outh it is &s;eparated from Brabant by the Maes. Its greate&s;t extent from north to &s;outh is about forty-&s;even miles, and from we&s;t to ea&s;t near as much; but its figure is very irregular. The air here is much healthier and clearer than in the maritime provinces, the land lying higher. Excepting &s;ome part of what is called the Veluwe, the &s;oil is good and fruitful. The county of Zutphen, in particular, yields great quantities of apples, pears, and cherries; nor is it without meadows and arable lands, though the &s;oil in general is heathy. Gelderland is watered by the Rhine, and its three branches, the Waal, the Y&s;&s;el, and the Leck, be&s;ides le&s;&s;er &s;treams. In 1079, it was rai&s;ed to a county by the emperor Henry IV.
<PB N="462" REF="4660">
and in 1339 to a duchy, by the emperor Lewis of Bavaria. It had dukes of its own till 1528, when it was yielded up to the emperor Charles V. That part of it which at pre&s;ent con&s;titutes the province of Gelderland, acceded, in 1579, to the union of Utrecht. It is divided into three di&s;tricts, each of which has its &s;tates and diets. Tho&s;e for the whole province are held twice a-year, at the capital towns. The deputies &s;ent by the province to the &s;tates-general are nineteen. As to religion, here are two hundred and eighty-five Calvini&s;t mini&s;ters, fourteen Roman catholic con|gregations, and four Lutheran, be&s;ides three others of remon&s;trants and anabapti&s;ts. The places of mo&s;t note in the province are,</P>
<P>Nemmeguen, in Latin Noviomagum, which &s;tands on the Waal, nine miles from Cleves, and fifty-two from Am&s;terdam, and is the capital of the quarter to which it gives name. It is a large an|tient city, &s;trongly fortified, and plea&s;antly &s;ituated, where the Oppidum Batavorum is &s;uppo&s;ed by &s;ome to have &s;tood. It was formerly an impe|rial and han&s;e town. On the ea&s;t &s;ide of it &s;tands an old ca&s;tle, called the Falkenhof, where are plea&s;ant walks of lime-trees, and it contains &s;everal churches, belonging to different &s;ects. The provincial &s;tates, and tho&s;e of the di&s;trict, a&s;&s;emble in the &s;tadthou&s;e. This city is famous for the peace concluded here, in 1678, between the French and the confederates. It carries on a good trade with the duchy of Cleves, and makes great profit by its white beer, which is much e&s;teemed through|out the provinces. In the town-hou&s;e is kept the &s;word with which the counts Egmont and Horn were beheaded by the duke of Alva's order. The burgrave, who re&s;ides in the ca&s;tle, is one of the chief nobles of the province, and pre|&s;ides in its diets.</P>
<P><PB N="463" REF="4670">
Tiel or Thiel, a town on the Waal, &s;eventeen miles from Nemeguen, to the we&s;t. Tho' much fallen from what it was formerly, yet it is &s;till pretty well inhabited, and has a tolerable trade, by means of the Waal and Maes.</P>
<P>Bommel or Salt Bommel, a town on an i&s;land in the Waal, called, from the town, Bommelwaard.</P>
<P>Batenburg, a country town on the Maes, having a &s;tately ca&s;tle, which, with the town, belongs to the counts of Bentheim-Steinfurt.</P>
<P>Panderen, a village in the bailiage of Upper-Be|tuwe, where begins the new canal, through which the Rhine at pre&s;ent pa&s;&s;es. In the &s;ame bailiage &s;tood formerly the Schenken-Schanze, a very &s;trong and &s;pacious fort, built, in 1586, by general Martin Schenk; and the Tolhaus, a ca&s;tle where the dukes of Gelderland frequently re&s;ided, and where ve&s;&s;els &s;till pay toll, as they did formerly. The Betuwe is that tract of land lying between the Rhine and the Waal. It is divided into two bailiages, called the Upper and Lower, or Ea&s;tern and We&s;tern Be|tuwe.</P>
<P>Zutphen, a town on the right bank of the Y&s;&s;el, giving name to a county, which con&s;titutes ano|ther of the three quarters into which the province is divided. The town is large and &s;trongly forti|fied, and has a bridge of boats over the Y&s;&s;el, which divides the town into two parts. The whole neighbouring country may be laid under water by means of the Borkel, a river which here joins the Y&s;&s;el. There are &s;everal churches here, belonging to different &s;ects; with ho&s;pitals for the aged, &s;ick, orphans, and &s;trangers; and a gymna|&s;ium. The town was formerly one of the Han&s;e, and more flouri&s;hing than at pre&s;ent. There are plea&s;ant walks about it, e&s;pecially on the ramparts. The citizens are noted for their courte&s;y and po|litene&s;s, to which the many gentlemen who
<PB N="464" REF="4680">
live here greatly contribute. Gerard van Zutphen, ma&s;ter to the famous Thomas &aacute; Kempis, and other learned men, were born in this city: and the great Sir Philip Sidney died of the wounds he received at the &s;iege thereof. Its name, in the Dutch, &s;ig|nifies the South Fen.</P>
<P>Doe&s;burg, a &s;mall but well fortified town, at the conflux of the Old and New Y&s;&s;el, the latter of which is the canal cut by Dru&s;us to bring the Rhine into the Old Y&s;&s;el. This town &s;tands &s;ix miles from Zutphen, and, by &s;ome, is &s;uppo&s;ed to derive its name from Dru&s;us. A great deal of tobacco grows in the neighbourhood.</P>
<P>Deutichem, a &s;mall town on the Old Y&s;&s;el. Here great quantities of bombs, bullets, and gra|nadoes, are ca&s;t out of iron dug in this county.</P>
<P>Lochem, a &s;mall open town on the Borkel.</P>
<P>Grol, a &s;mall open town, on a branch of the Borkel named the Slink, near the borders of the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter, fifteen miles from Zutphen. It is a great thoroughfare for waggons, laden with goods from Germany, which pay toll at this place.</P>
<P>Borkelo, a &s;mall town on the Borkel, giving name to a lord&s;hip which had once lords of its own, and occa&s;ioned the war betwixt the &s;tates and the bi&s;hop of Mun&s;ter, in 1665 and 1672, the latter claiming a right to it, upon the failure of the male i&s;&s;ue of its lords.</P>
<P>Breedevoort, a &s;mall but well fortified town, near the borders of the bi&s;hopric of Mun&s;ter, be|longing to the prince of Orange.</P>
<P>Heerenberg, a &s;mall town, which gives name to a lord&s;hip belonging to the prince of Hohen|zollern-Sigmaringen.</P>
<P>Arnheim or Arnem, which gives name to the third quarter, and is the capital not only of that, but of the whole province. It &s;tands on the Rhine,
<PB N="465" REF="4690">
at the foot of the Veluwe hills, &s;ix miles from Ni|meguen, and forty-eight from Am&s;terdam, and is &s;trongly fortified. It has al&s;o a commodious har|bour, and is the &s;eat of the &s;upreme council of Gelderland, and the chamber of accounts. Here is an antient palace, in which the dukes of Gelder|land, and after them the &s;tadtholders of the pro|vince, u&s;ed to keep their court. The walls, being delightfully planted with lime-trees, make a plea|&s;ant walk. In the great church are the monu|ments of &s;everal counts and dukes of Gelder|land; and near the city is the village of Oo&s;ter|beck, where the emperor Henry III. was born, in 1027.</P>
<P>Harderwyk, &s;ituate on the Zuyder-&s;ee, twenty-&s;ix miles from Arnheim, and thirty from Am&s;ter|dam. Here is an univer&s;ity, which, till 1648, was only a Schola illu&s;tris. The trade of the town is con&s;iderable, e&s;pecially in fi&s;h, of which its red herrings are much admired. The &s;teeple of St. Mary's church, a mo&s;t &s;tately &s;tructure, is &s;o high that it &s;erves for a land-mark, being &s;een at a great di&s;tance, both by &s;ea and land. Prodigious quan|tities of blue-berries are gathered in the neighbour|ing woods, and carried to Am&s;terdam, and other towns. The provincial mint is in this city, the for|tifications of which are in the antient manner. The famous lawyer Gerardus Voetius is &s;aid to have been a native of this place.</P>
<P>Wageningen, a &s;mall town on the Rhine, with a commodious harbour. In the neighbourhood to|bacco is much cultivated.</P>
<P>Elburg, a &s;mall town on the Zuyder-&s;ee, who&s;e ramparts, planted with lime trees, form a delight|ful walk. Its inhabitants &s;ub&s;i&s;t chiefly by fi&s;hing, and catching wild-ducks.</P>
<P>In that tract of land called the Veluwe is the lord&s;hip of Loo, belonging, with a beautiful &s;eat
<PB N="466" REF="4700">
on it, to the prince of Orange. In the &s;ame di|&s;trict, at the village of Dieren, is another &s;eat be|longing to the prince. Between the Nimmegen quar|ter and the provinces of Holland and Utrecht, lie the counties of Buren and Kuilenburg, which are al&s;o the property of the prince of Orange, and take their names from two &s;mall towns in them.</P>

<DIV3>
<HEAD>HOLLAND.</HEAD>
<P>This province, which is the large&s;t of the &s;even, is divided into South and North Holland, the lat|ter of which is al&s;o called We&s;t Frie&s;land; and bounded on the we&s;t by the German ocean, or North Sea; to the ea&s;t by the Zuyder-&s;ee, the pro|vince of Utrecht, and part of Gelderland; to the &s;outh by Dutch Brabant and Zealand; and to the north by the Zuyder-&s;ee. Its greate&s;t extent from north to &s;outh, including the i&s;land of Texel, is about ninety Engli&s;h miles; but from ea&s;t to we&s;t its extent varies from forty to twenty-five. To defend it again&s;t the &s;ea, dykes have been erected at an immen&s;e expence, and innumerable cana's cut to drain it, as being naturally very low and mar&s;hy. Some parts of the province are very fruitful in corn; but the greater part con&s;i&s;ts of rich pa&s;tures, wherein are kept large herds of kine, which &s;upply them with incredible quanti|ties of butter and chee&s;e. Of the latter, that of Edam, in North Holland, is highly e&s;teemed. The many rivers and canals that inter&s;ect the pro|vince are of great advantage to its commerce, but contribute to render the air foggy and unwhole|&s;ome. There is a communication by water be|twixt almo&s;t every town and village. Towards the middle al&s;o of the province are great numbers of turf pits. It is &s;o populous, that the number
<PB N="467" REF="4710">
of the inhabitants is computed at one million two hundred thou&s;and. In point of cleanline&s;s, no country &s;urpa&s;&s;es, and few come up to it, e&s;pecially in North Holland, and that even in the villages. From the counts of Holland this province de|volved, in 1436, to the dukes of Burgundy, and from them to the hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, along with the other provinces. The &s;tates of Holland and We&s;t Frie&s;land are compo&s;ed of the nobility and depu|ties of the towns: of the latter there are eighteen that &s;end deputies to the a&s;&s;embly of the &s;tates, which is held at the Hague. The grand pen&s;ionary is a per&s;on of great dignity and weight in this a&s;|&s;embly, and his office requires extraordinary abilities. There are al&s;o two councils compo&s;ed of deputies, one for South, and another for North Holland, who have the cognizance of the revenue and military affairs. The whole province &s;ends one deputy from among the noble&s;&s;e to the &s;tates-general, who takes precedence of all others, together with three or four more. There are two &s;upreme courts of ju|dicature for Holland and Zealand, viz. the great council of Holland and Zealand, and the hof, or court of Holland. To the&s;e appeals lie from the towns; but the cau&s;es of noblemen come before them in the fir&s;t in&s;tance. With re&s;pect to the eccle&s;ia&s;tical government, there is a &s;ynod held annually both in South and North Holland, of which the former contains eleven cla&s;&s;es, and the latter &s;ix; and the mini&s;ters of both together amount to three hundred and thirty-one. In the whole province are thirty-&s;even towns, eight bo|roughs, and four hundred villages, of which the mo&s;t con&s;iderable in South Holland, taking them according to their rank, are,</P>

Merwe, in 1421. It is &s;o &s;trong by nature, that it has little or no need of art. Here is the mint for South Holland, a gymna&s;ium, a commodious harbour, and a con&s;iderable trade, e&s;pecially in grain, linen, thread, Rheni&s;h wine, and timber, the two la&s;t of which are brought down the Rhine from Germany. The apartment in the Guildhall, in which the famous &s;ynod which condemned the Arminians in 1618 and 19, was held, is &s;till &s;hewn to &s;trangers. Here the counts of Holland for|merly had their u&s;ual re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Harlem, &s;ituate on the river Sparen, not far from the lake to which it gives name. It is a large, populous, and plea&s;ant city, ten miles from Am&s;terdam to the we&s;t, and fourteen from Leyden towards the north. The papi&s;ts here far out-num|ber the prote&s;tants. Va&s;t quantities of linen and thread are bleached here, the waters of the lake having a particular quality that renders them very fit for that purpo&s;e; but neither the manufactures of &s;ilk, cloth, or linen, are in &s;o flouri&s;hing a condition as formerly. This city, as is well known, claims the honour of the invention of printing, which &s;ome think more ju&s;tly due to John Gotten|berg of Mentz. The magi&s;trates keep in their town-hou&s;e the fir&s;t book printed by Co&s;ter, about the year 1440. Before the Reformation Har|lem was a bi&s;hop's &s;ee. It is famous for the &s;iege which it held out again&s;t the Spaniards for ten months in 1573; the town&s;men, before they capi|tulated, were reduced to eat leather, gra&s;s, and the vile&s;t animals. They kept a corre&s;pondence with the prince of Orange, for a con&s;iderable time, by means of carrier pigeons. There is a com|munication with the lake, and with Am&s;ter|dam and Leyden, by means of &s;everal canals. Schemes have been often formed for draining the lake, but never put in execution. To the &s;outh of the town lies a wood, cut into delightful walks
<PB N="469" REF="4730">
and vi&s;tas. A &s;ort of phren&s;y in regard to flowers, particularly tulips, once prevailed here, in con&s;e|quence of which the mo&s;t beautiful &s;orts were bought and &s;old at an extravagant price. The aca|demy of &s;ciences was founded at Harlem in 1752.</P>
<P>Delft, a large, hand&s;ome, &s;tately city, four miles from the Hague, towards the &s;outh-ea&s;t. There is little &s;tir here, the city being chiefly inha|bited by rich people, who have retired from bu&s;i|ne&s;s. In the great church is a magnificent mau&s;o|leum, erected in 1609, at the expence of the &s;tates-general, to the memory of William I. prince of Orange, who was ba&s;ely a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by an emi&s;|&s;ary of Philip II. king of Spain. At the feet of the prince's &s;tatue lies a dog, who is &s;aid to have died of grief when his ma&s;ter was murdered. Among other &s;tately monuments in the old church is that of the renowned admiral Van Tromp. Delft is famous for its fine earthen ware made in imitation of china, and known by the name of Delft ware. The town hou&s;e is adorned with &s;everal &s;tatues, as tho&s;e of Ju&s;tice, Prudence, and Mercy, and over the gate is this di&s;tich:</P>
<Q>Haec domus odit, amat, punit, con&s;ervat, honorat, Nequitiam, pacem, crimina, jura, bonos.</Q>
<P>i. e.</P>
<Q>This hou&s;e hates wickedne&s;s, loves peace, puni&s;hes crimes, pre&s;erves the laws, and honours the good.</Q>
<P>Here, as in mo&s;t of the other towns of the pro|vinces, are chimes, extremely harmonious: they play one tune at the fir&s;t quarter after every hour, two at the next, three at the next, and four before the hour &s;trikes. The ar&s;enal for the province of Holland, together with two powder-magazines for the &s;ame province, and two for the Generalit&eacute;, are kept here. Here al&s;o lie the yachts, which bring
<PB N="470" REF="4740">
the deputies of the &s;everal provinces to the a&s;&s;em|blies at the Hague. The&s;e yachts are exqui&s;itely beautiful and rich, the provinces and cities vying with each other which &s;hall have the be&s;t accom|modation for their repre&s;entatives. They are from thirty to fifty tons burthen, being adorned with &s;treamers, and carrying guns, with trumpets, and other mu&s;ic. To this town belongs Delfshaven, a beautiful village on the Maes, about eight miles from Delft, to the &s;outh-ea&s;t. It is a flouri&s;hing place, having a good harbour, in which lie the Ea&s;t-India &s;hips, and herring-bu&s;&s;es, with other ve&s;&s;els be|longing to the merchants of Delft.</P>
<P>Leyden, in Latin, Lugdunum Batavorum, one of the large&s;t and fine&s;t cities in Holland, abounds with canals, along which are rows of lofty trees, that afford very plea&s;ant walks. An arm, or &s;mall branch of the Rhine, runs through it. Over the canals are one hundred and forty-five bridges, mo&s;t of them of &s;tone or brick. The univer&s;ity here is the olde&s;t in the United-Provinces: it has large privi|leges, a library well furni&s;hed, and particularly rich in manu&s;cripts, a phy&s;ic garden well &s;tocked with all &s;orts of plants, many of which have been brought from the Cape of Good Hope and the Ea&s;t-Indies, an anatomy-hall, well provided with &s;keletons, and an ob&s;ervatory. The profe&s;&s;ors, who are ge|nerally very eminent, read public lectures four times a week, for which they take no money; but about three guineas are paid for a cour&s;e of private lectures, which la&s;ts a whole year. The &s;tudents have no di&s;tinct habit, but all wear &s;words, though they generally go to the public and private lectures in their night-gowns and &s;lippers. The &s;alaries of the profe&s;&s;ors are from one hundred to two hundred pounds a-year: they wear gowns only when they pre&s;ide at public di&s;putations, read public lectures, or meet in the &s;enate; and their lectures are always
<PB N="471" REF="4750">
in Latin. The &s;tudents do not lodge in the uni|ver&s;ity, but where they plea&s;e in the town. The cloth manufacture here is much decayed, which formerly flouri&s;hed to &s;uch a degree, that one hun|dred thou&s;and pieces, it is &s;aid, have &s;ometimes been made in a year. The city is famous for the long and &s;evere &s;iege it maintained in 1573 again&s;t the Spaniards. We cannot help mentioning the reply of that illu&s;trious magi&s;trate, Adrian de Verf, when the citizens repre&s;ented to him the havock made by the famine during the &s;iege, and in&s;i&s;ted upon his &s;urrendering: "Friends, &s;aid he, here is my body, divide it among you, to &s;atisfy your hunger, but bani&s;h all thoughts of &s;ur|rendering to the cruel and perfidious Spaniard." They took his advice, in regard to their not &s;ur|rendering, and never would li&s;ten to any overtures; but told the Spaniards, they would hold out as long as they had an arm to eat, and another to fight. There are &s;ome fine churches here, and many long, broad, hand&s;ome &s;treets; but the papi&s;ts, as at Harlem, are more numerous than the prote&s;tants.</P>
<P>Am&s;terdam, or Am&s;teldam, derives its name from the Am&s;tel, on which it is &s;ituated, and the dam, or dyke, built there, to prevent the inunda|tion of the river. It is the fir&s;t city in the pro|vinces in point of trade, extent, and wealth, though not in rank. The Am&s;tel divides it into two parts, and fills its fine canals, before it joins the Y, which is an arm of the Zuyder, or South-&s;ea, that almo&s;t entirely divides South from North-Holland. The &s;oil being mar&s;hy, the buildings are founded upon oaken piles, or &s;takes, driven at a great expence, into the ground. The canals, which are very nume|rous, divide the town into a multitude of i&s;lands, which are joined again by a va&s;t number of bridges. The &s;hips lying in the Yare in &s;uch numbers, that their ma&s;ts look like a fore&s;t. Am&s;terdam &s;tands
<PB N="472" REF="4760">
ten miles from Harlem, twenty from Leyden, twenty-eight from the Hague, and twenty-nine from Rotterdam. In the thirteenth century it was only a &s;mall fi&s;hing town; it now appears in the form of a cre&s;cent, or half-moon, on the Y, and is well fortified on the land-&s;ide with ramparts and ba&s;tions. On each of the latter is a windmill, be&s;ides a va&s;t number of others, all round the town. The gates of the city are very fine, e&s;pecially that of Harlem. On the &s;ide next the Y, it is defend|ed by a double row of piles driven into the water, with openings for &s;hips to pa&s;s in and out; the le&s;&s;er lying within, and the greater without the piles, and &s;ome even between them. The Plan|tagie is a place laid out into beautiful walks, and planted with trees. On the Y is al&s;o a very de|lightful walk, commanding a fine pro&s;pect. A|mong the public buildings mo&s;t de&s;erving the at|tention of a traveller, is the &s;tadthou&s;e, which &s;tands in a large &s;quare on the Damme, and co&s;t the city above thirty millions of guilders. It is admi|rably adorned with marble, &s;culpture, &s;tatues, painting, and guilding. Underneath are pri&s;ons for criminals, and large apartments, where the trea&s;ures of the famous bank are kept. Here al&s;o the a&s;&s;emblies of the &s;enate are held, and cau&s;es, both civil and criminal, are tried, and, in general, all public bu&s;ine&s;s tran&s;acted. The chimes of the tower are extremely fine, and it commands a de|lightful pro&s;pect of the city and its environs, as far as the Zuyder-&s;ee. The exchange too is worth view|ing, as well as the ar&s;enal; the inn called The Three Waggons, the gymna&s;ium illu&s;tre, the Ea&s;t and We&s;t India hou&s;es, the lombard and loan bank, the theatre, the phy&s;ic-garden, the chirurgical and anatomical college, the naval &s;tore-hou&s;es, the docks, &s;luices, churches, ho&s;pitals, hou&s;es of cor|rection, harbour, towers, warehou&s;es, weighing-hou&s;es,
<PB N="473" REF="4770">
&amp;c. The lombard is a corporation em|powered by authority to lend money upon pledges at a moderate intere&s;t. When the &s;um wanted and the pawn are con&s;iderable, as in the ca&s;e of the elector of Bavaria's jewels, it is thought the bank both advances the money, and receives the intere&s;t. The bank here was founded in 1609. All payments, exceeding the &s;um of three hundred guilders, mu&s;t be made in bank. Bank money is generally about five per cent. better than current, and the difference is termed the agio. In&s;tead of drawing an intere&s;t, every proprietor pays con&s;i|derably for keeping his money in the bank, the credit of which is very great, as depending not &s;o much upon the trea&s;ure actually depo&s;ited there, as upon the &s;ecurity of the city, and even of the republic: but it is &s;aid to be a mi&s;take, that the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of this bank is managed by tran&s;|fer, and no money ever i&s;&s;ued. It is under the care and in&s;pection of the burgoma&s;ters. As to the trade of this city let it &s;uffice to &s;ay, that it has a great &s;hare not only of that carried on in Europe, but in all the re&s;t of the world; and in particular, that it is in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one half of that va&s;t com|merce carried on by the Dutch to the Ea&s;t-Indies, and governs the whole. The indu&s;try of the inha|bitants of Am&s;terdam is amazing; all are employ|ed in &s;ome trade, manufactures, or bu&s;ine&s;s, and none are idle, but &s;uch as either want hands, or &s;trength to u&s;e them. The number of inhabitants is computed at about two hundred thou&s;and, of which a great part are papi&s;ts and Jews. The number of foreigners here is al&s;o generally very con&s;iderable. The greate&s;t di&s;advantages this city labours under is the want of good air and water, and perhaps conver&s;ation. At the mouth of the harbour is a bar, which cannot be pa&s;&s;ed by large &s;hips, till they are lightened.</P>
<P><PB N="474" REF="4780">
Gauda, commonly called Ter-Gow, is &s;eated on the &s;mall river Gow, from which it has its name, and which falls into the Y&s;&s;el below the town, about twenty-three miles from Am&s;terdam to|wards the &s;outh-ea&s;t. The inhabitants, by their &s;luices, can lay the adjacent country all under water. The paintings on the windows of the church of St. John the Bapti&s;t are &s;aid to be the fine&s;t, of that kind, in the world; they con&s;i&s;t of &s;everal pieces both of &s;acred and profane hi&s;tory. The trade of this place, at pre&s;ent, is chiefly in cordage, thread, and tobacco pipes, in the la&s;t of which they &s;ur|pa&s;s all others; but the clay is brought from the bi&s;hopric of Liege. Va&s;t quantities of bricks and tiles are al&s;o made in the neighbourhood of the town; and mo&s;t of the barks employed in the trade between Holland, Zealand, and the Au|&s;trian Netherlands, pa&s;s through it. The gene|rality of the inhabitants, however, are &s;aid to be &s;uch as have quitted bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;pend the remain|der of their days in peace and retirement. The archives of Holland are kept here.</P>
<P>Rotterdam, &s;tanding at the conflux of the Maes, or Merwe, and the Rotter, from the latter of which, and Dam, its name is formed. It is thirteen miles from the Hague, twenty-eight from Am&s;terdam, and fifteen from Leyden; and, next to the two la&s;t, it is &s;aid to be now the greate&s;t city in Hol|land. Its &s;treets are &s;pacious, adorned with lofty trees, and noble canals; by the la&s;t of which &s;hips of the greate&s;t burden run into the heart of the city, and lade and unlade at the merchants doors. The trade here is very great, e&s;pecially to Eng|land and Scotland. Over the Maes, which is here very broad, is a bridge, on which is placed a bra&s;s &s;tatue of Era&s;mus. The Haaring-Vliet, and the Boom-quay, are very fine &s;treets. The latter lies along the Maes, and on one &s;ide has a magnificent
<PB N="475" REF="4790">
row of trees and hou&s;es, or rather palaces, extend|ing above half a mile; and on the other the river, where &s;hips are continually &s;ailing up and down, or at anchor. This charming key, being very broad and clean, &s;erves in&s;tead of a mall. The principal buildings in the town are the exchange, the Ea&s;t and We&s;t-India hou&s;es, the bank, the ar|&s;enal, and the great church, or that of St. Laurence, near which is the little ob&s;cure hou&s;e in which Era&s;mus was born, with his picture, and this di&s;tich over the door:</P>
<Q>Aedibus his ortus, mundum d coravit Era&s;mus, Artibus ingenuis, religione, fide.</Q>
<P>i. e.</P>
<Q>Era&s;mus, who adorned the world with arts and &s;ciences, religion and virtue, was born in this hou&s;e.</Q>
<P>There are three high tribunals in this city, viz. that of the admiralty of the Maes; of the high-bailiff, or dyke-graaf of Schieland; and that of the judges of Schieland. On the ea&s;t and we&s;t &s;ides of the city are docks, where they are continually build|ing, repairing, or launching ve&s;&s;els; but the large&s;t &s;hips belonging to the admiralty of Rotterdam lie at Helvoet&s;luys; and, as there is not a &s;ufficient depth of water at the mouth of the Maes for &s;hips that draw above fifteen feet, they are obliged to come hither by the way of Helvoet&s;luys, and the Haaring Vliet. The gla&s;s-hou&s;e here makes a|bundance of gla&s;s-toys, and enamelled bowls, which are &s;ent to India, and exchanged for China ware, and other oriental commodities.</P>
<P>Gorkum, &s;ituated at the conflux of the Merwe and Linge, on the frontiers of Gelderland, car|ries on a good trade in corn and &s;almon, (the latter of which is taken in the Merwe) and in but|ter,
<PB N="476" REF="4800">
chee&s;e, poultry, and wild-ducks, brought down the Linge from Gelderland. From the &s;teeple of the church may be &s;een twenty-two walled towns, with a va&s;t number of villages. It is a neat well built city, and, being one of the keys of Holland, is &s;trongly fortified, e&s;pecially on the &s;ide next Gel|derland, as on the others the country may be laid under water.</P>
<P>Schiedam, &s;o called from its &s;ituation on the Schie, which a little lower falls into the Maes. It is a &s;mall but populous city, and the third in rank among the &s;mall cities that &s;end deputies to the provincial &s;tates. In its neighbourhood grow great numbers of juniper trees. The inhabitants &s;ub|&s;i&s;t chiefly by the herring fi&s;hery, and by making nets.</P>
<P>Schoonhoven, at the conflux of the Leck and Vliet, about eleven miles from Rotterdam. It is well fortified, has a good harbour, and trade, e&s;pecially in &s;almon, paper, and herrings. The adjacent country may be laid under water.</P>
<P>Briel, &s;ituated in the i&s;land of Voorn, on the left-&s;ide, and near the mouth of the Maes. It has a good harbour and trade, and is &s;trongly for|tified. Here the famous admiral Tromp was born. On the ramparts are plea&s;ant walks of trees. The i&s;land, in which it &s;tands, is fruitful in corn, but the air is too moi&s;t. It is the la&s;t of the towns in South-Holland that &s;end deputies to the &s;tates; and one of tho&s;e that, in 1585, was mortgaged to queen Elizabeth. Of the other towns, the prin|cipal are,</P>
<P>The Hague, in Latin Haga Comitis, in French La Haye, in Dutch der Haag, or 'S-Graavenhage, i. e. the Earl's Grove or Wood, from the wood near which it is built, and in which the earls of Holland had a country-hou&s;e. Though it &s;ends no deputies to the &s;tates, it is one of the mo&s;t con|&s;iderable
<PB N="477" REF="4810">
towns in Holland, plea&s;antly &s;ituated, and exceeding beautiful. The inhabitants al&s;o breathe a better air than tho&s;e of the other cities, as it &s;tands on a dry &s;oil, &s;omewhat higher than the re&s;t of the country. It has no gates or walls, but is &s;urrounded by a moat, over which there are many draw-bridges. Two hours are required to walk round it, and it contains about forty or fifty thou|&s;and &s;ouls. It is a place of much &s;plendor and bu|&s;ine&s;s, being the &s;eat of the high colleges of the republic and province of Holland, and the re&s;i|dence of the &s;tadtholder, and foreign amba&s;&s;adors; and there are a great many fine &s;treets and &s;quares in it. In the Inner-Court all the high colleges and courts of ju&s;tice hold their a&s;&s;emblies: there al&s;o the foot-guards do duty, as the hor&s;e-guards do in the Outer, when the &s;tates are &s;itting. De Plaats is an open airy place, in form of a triangle, adorn|ed with neat and beautiful buildings: the Vyver-berg is an eminence, laid out into &s;everal fine &s;hady walks, with the Vyver, a large ba&s;on of water, at the bottom: the Voorhout is the mo&s;t celebrated part of the Hague, and con&s;i&s;ts of the mall, and three ways for coaches on each &s;ide, planted with trees, being much the &s;ame as St. James's park at London: the palace of Opdam, or Wa&s;&s;enaar, is built in a very elegant ta&s;te: the Prince and Prince&s;s Grafts are fine &s;treets: the Plain, in Dutch Het Pleyn, is a beautiful grove, laid out in &s;everal cro&s;s walks, and &s;urrounded with &s;tately hou&s;es: the Jewi&s;h &s;ynagogue is well worth being &s;een by a curious traveller; and al&s;o the palaces of the prince of Orange, the Hotel of Spain, the New Voor|hout, the mau&s;oleum of the baron of Opdam in the great church, and the &s;everal ho&s;pitals. The environs of the Hague are exceeding plea&s;ant. Among other agreeable objects are the wood, with the palace of Orange at the extremity of it,
<PB N="478" REF="4820">
called the Hou&s;e in the Wood; the village of Scheveling; and the &s;and hills along the North Sea; with the village of Voorburg, and the charming &s;eats and fine gardens round it. Two miles from the Hauge is Ry&s;wick, a village; and, a quarter of a mile from that, a noble palace belonging to the prince of Orange, famous for the treaty of peace concluded there in 1697. Loo&s;duynen, where Margaret, counte&s;s of Henneburg, and daughter of Florence IV. count of Holland and Zealand, is &s;aid to have been delivered of three hundred and &s;ixty-five children at a birth, in 1276, is about five miles from the Hague. Five miles beyond Loo&s;duynen, and not far from the beauti|ful village of Grave&s;ande, is Hon&s;lardyck, another palace belonging to the prince of Orange, and one of the fine&s;t &s;tructures in the Low-Countries.</P>
<P>Naorden, a town on the Zuyder-&s;ee, &s;trongly for|tified, and a kind of a barrier to Am&s;terdam. Here are &s;ome woollen and velvet manufactories.</P>
<P>Muyden, a well fortified town at the mouth of the Vecht, on the Zuyder-&s;ee. Great quantities of &s;alt are made here; and the adjacent country, in ca&s;e of need, may be laid under water.</P>
<P>Wezep, the chief bu&s;ine&s;s of who&s;e inhabitants is to carry fre&s;h water from the Vecht to Am&s;ter|dam; Nieuwer&s;luice, on the Vecht; Woerden, on the Old Rhine; Oudewater; Nieuwpoort on the Leck, Gertruydenberg, and Der-Klundert, belong|ing to the hou&s;e of Na&s;&s;au; Helvoet&s;luys, which has a &s;mall, but commodious harbour, where the packet boat from England u&s;ually arrives; Goree, on an i&s;land of the &s;ame name; Vianen, on the Leck; William&s;tadt, on the frontiers of Dutch Bra|bant; Workham; Heu&s;den; Vlaardingen, a pretty large place, from which more bu&s;&s;es go, one year with another, to the herring fi&s;hery, than from all the other ports of the Netherlands put together;

and Catwyk-op-Zee, where is a mo&s;t &s;tately &s;eat belonging to the Wa&s;&s;enaar family. Near the la&s;t &s;tood formerly the Arx Britannica, a fort or ca&s;tle, &s;aid to have been erected by the emperor Caligula.</P>
<P>Be&s;ides the&s;e, there are &s;till &s;ome other &s;mall towns and forts, and a great number of villages, &s;uperior to many towns, in other countries, in trade, wealth, extent, and beauty. Among the forts is Love&s;tein, on the borders of Gelderland, in which the celebrated Grotius was confined, in 1619.</P>
