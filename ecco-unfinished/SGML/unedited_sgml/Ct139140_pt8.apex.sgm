<HEAD>THE NATURAL HISTORY OF BIRDS.</HEAD>
<DIV2>
<HEAD>The IBIS <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In Greek <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, which the Romans adopted. It has no name in European languages, as being unknown in our climates. Ac|cording to Albertus, it was called in Egyptian <HI>Leheras.</HI> In Avi|cenna, the word <HI>An&s;chuz</HI> denotes the Ibis. St. Jerome was mi&s;|taken in tran&s;lating <HI>Jan&s;chuph (Leviticus,</HI> ii. <HI>I&s;aiah,</HI> xxxiv.) by Ibis, for a nocturnal bird is meant in that pa&s;&s;age. Some inter|preters rendor the Hebrew word <HI>Tin&s;chemet</HI> by Ibis.</NOTE>.</HEAD>
<P>OF all the &s;uper&s;titious practices that have ever degraded the human race, the wor|&s;hip of animals might be deemed the mo&s;t abject and the mo&s;t ab&s;urd: and yet did that propen|&s;ity originate from the pure&s;t of motives. In the early ages of the world, man was on all &s;ides encompa&s;&s;ed by dangers, and had to &s;truggle naked and unarmed again&s;t the formidable at|tacks of his numerous foes. Tho&s;e animals, therefore, which con&s;pired with his efforts to de&s;troy and eradicate the ho&s;tile tribes, were na|turally
<PB N="2" REF="9">
entitled to his regard and affection. But the &s;entiment of gratitude afterwards degene|rated into veneration; and fear and intere&s;t, nouri&s;hing the groveling propen&s;ion, both the u&s;eful and the pernicious creatures were alike exalted into the rank of gods.</P>
<P>Egypt is one of tho&s;e countries where animal|wor&s;hip was of the highe&s;t antiquity, and ob|&s;erved with the mo&s;t &s;crupulous attention, for many ages; and that humiliating &s;pecies of ido|latry, which is authenticated by all the monu|ments that have been tran&s;mitted to po&s;terity, &s;eems to prove, that the original &s;ettlers had long contended with the noxious animals. In fact, crocodiles, &s;erpents, gra&s;shoppers, and all the other loath&s;ome creatures, teemed in the deep and &s;pacious mud, deluged by the annual inundation of the river. The heat of a tropical &s;un fo&s;tering the rich &s;lime would engender infi|nite numbers of offen&s;ive and &s;hapele&s;s beings, which would &s;ucce&s;&s;ively be effaced, till the earth, purged of its impurities, was occupied by nobler inhabitants.</P>
<P><Q>"Swarms of little venomous &s;erpents," the early hi&s;torians relate <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">H$rodotus, <HI>Euterpe,</HI> N&deg; 76. Aelian, Solinus, Marcellinus, Pomponius Mela, <HI>lib.</HI> iii. 8.</NOTE>, &startq;ro&s;e out of the &s;lime of mar&s;hes, and flying in a great body towards Egypt, would have entered into that country and &s;pread de&s;olation, had not the Ibis op|po&s;ed it&s;elf to their inroad, and repelled them.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="10">
Was not this the &s;ource of the &s;uper&s;titious ve|neration paid to that bird? The prie&s;ts encou|raged the notions of the vulgar; when the gods, they &s;aid, deigned to a&s;&s;ume a vi&s;ible form, it was that of the Ibis. Their tutelar deity <HI>Thoth</HI> or Mercury, the inventor of arts and of laws, had already undergone that transformation <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Plato in <HI>Phaedr.</HI></NOTE>; and Ovid, faithful to this ancient mythology, in the battle of the gods and giants, conceals Mer|cury under the wings of an Ibis, &amp;c <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Metam. <HI>lib.</HI> v.</NOTE>. But &s;et|ting a&s;ide all the&s;e fables, we have &s;till to exa|mine the hi&s;tory of the combats between the&s;e birds and the &s;erpents. Herodotus a&s;&s;ures us, that he went to view the field of battle. <Q>&startq;Near the town Butus,&endq;</Q> he &s;ays&punc; <Q>&startq;on the confines of Arabia, where the mountains open into the va&s;t plain of Egypt, I there &s;aw immen&s;e heaps of &s;erpents' bones <NOTE N="&#38;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herodotus, <HI>Euterpe,</HI> N^o^s 75 and 76.</NOTE>.&endq;</Q> Cicero cites this pa&s;&s;age <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Lib. i. <HI>De Nat. Deorum.</HI></NOTE>, and Pliny &s;eems to confirm it, by &s;ay|ing, that the Egyptians invoke the Ibi&s;es again&s;t the inva&s;ion of &s;erpents <NOTE N="&par;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat. Lib. x. 28.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>We read al&s;o in the hi&s;torian Jo&s;ephus, that when Mo&s;es made war on the Aethiopians, he carried, in cages of <HI>papyrus,</HI> a great number of Ibi&s;es, to oppo&s;e them to the &s;erpents <NOTE N="&para;" PLACE="foot"><HI>Antiq. Judaic.</HI> lib. ii. 10.</NOTE>. This
<PB N="4" REF="11">
&s;tory, which is not very probable, is ea&s;ily ex|plained by a fact mentioned by Maillet, in his de&s;cription of Egypt: <Q>&startq;A bird named <HI>Pharaoh's capon</HI> (known to be the Ibis) follows more than an hundred leagues the caravans in their route to Mecca, for the &s;ake of the dung left at the encampments, though at other times it is never &s;een on that track <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">De&s;cription de l'Egypt, <HI>partie</HI> II. p. 23.</NOTE>&endq;</Q>. We may pre&s;ume, that the Ibi&s;es thus accompanied the Hebrew nation in their march out of Egypt; and that Jo&s;ephus has disfigured the fact, by a&s;|cribing to the prudence of the general what was due only to the in&s;tinct of the birds; and has introduced the army of Aethiopians and the cages of papyrus to embelli&s;h his narration, and to exalt our idea of the legi&s;lator of the Jews.</P>
<P>To kill the Ibis was, among the Egyptians, forbidden under pain of death <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Herodotus, <HI>uti &s;upra.</HI></NOTE>. That peo|ple, who&s;e temper was equally gloomy and vain, invented the lugubrious art of preparing mummies, by which they endeavoured, we may &s;ay, to perpetuate death, and to counteract the benevolent views of nature, which, in compa&s;|&s;ion to our feelings, labours a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly to efface every di&s;mal and funereal image. Not only were they &s;olicitous to pre&s;erve human bodies, they applied their &s;kill in embalming to the &s;acred animals. Many receptacles of mum|mies
<PB N="5" REF="12">
which have been dug up in the plain of Saccara are called <HI>bird-pits,</HI> becau&s;e only birds are found embalmed, particularly the Ibis, con|tained in tall earthen pots, who&s;e orifice is &s;topped with cement. We have received &s;everal of the&s;e ve&s;&s;els; and in all of them we di&s;cover|ed a &s;ort of doll, formed by the bandages which enca&s;ed the bird, of which the greate&s;t part fell into black du&s;t when the ligatures were removed. We could however perceive all the bones of a bird, with the feathers &s;ticking to &s;ome bits of fle&s;h that remained &s;olid. From the&s;e frag|ments we could judge of the &s;ize of the bird, which was nearly equal to that of the curlew; and the bill, which was pre&s;erved in two of the mummies, &s;howed the genus: it was as thick as that of a &s;tork, was curved like the bill of the curlew, but not channelled: and as its curva|ture is equal throughout, we may place the Ibis between the &s;tork and the curlews <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See one of the bills repre&s;ented by Edwards, <HI>plate</HI> 105.</NOTE>. In fact, &s;o nearly is it related to both the&s;e genera of birds, that the modern naturali&s;ts have ranged it with the latter, and the ancients had cla&s;&s;ed it with the former. <Q>Herodotus has di&s;tinctly cha|racterized the Ibis, by &s;aying that &startq;its bill is much hooked, and its legs like tho&s;e of the crane." He takes notice of two &s;pecies: The fir&s;t," he relates, "is entirely black; the &s;econd, which con&s;tantly occurs, is all
<PB N="6" REF="13">
white, except the tips of the feathers of the wing and tail, which are very black; and the neck and head, which are only covered with &s;kin.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>But I mu&s;t here remove the ob&s;curity with which this pa&s;&s;age of Herodotus has been in|volved by the ignorance of tran&s;lators, and which ca&s;ts an air of fable and ab&s;urdity on the whole. <Q>A clau&s;e which ought to have been rendered literally, <HI>&startq;which oftener occur among men's feet,</HI> runs thus in their ver&s;ions, <HI>the&s;e indeed have feet like men.&endq;</HI></Q> Naturali&s;ts, at a lo&s;s to conceive the import of this odd compa|ri&s;on, have &s;trained to explain or palliate it. They &s;uppo&s;e that Herodotus mi&s;took the &s;tork for the white ibis, and imagined its flat toes to re&s;emble tho&s;e of a man. But this interpreta|tion was un&s;atisfactory; and the Ibis with human feet might have been rejected among the fables. Yet under this ab&s;urd image was it admitted as a real exi&s;tence; and we cannot help being &s;ur|prized to find at pre&s;ent this account in&s;erted in the memoirs of a learned academy <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>&startq;The other &s;pecies (the White Ibis) has its feet fa&s;hioned like the human feet.&endq;</Q> <HI>M$moires de l'Academie des In&s;criptions &amp; Belles Lettres,</HI> tome ix. p. 28.</P></NOTE>: though the chimera is only the production of the tran&s;|lator of that ancient hi&s;torian, who&s;e candour in acknowledging the uncertainty of his narratives, when drawn from other information, ought to
<PB N="7" REF="14">
procure him credit in &s;ubjects that came under his own ob&s;ervation.</P>
<P>Ari&s;totle, too, di&s;criminates two &s;pecies of Ibis; he adds, that the white kind is &s;pread over all Egypt, except near Pelu&s;ium, where only the black ones occur, which are &s;een in no other part of the country <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Animal. <HI>lib.</HI> ix. 27.</NOTE>. Pliny repeats this par|ticular ob&s;ervation <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Nat. <HI>lib.</HI> x. 30.</NOTE>. But all the ancients, at the &s;ame time that they remark the difference of the two birds in point of colour, a&s;cribe to them both the &s;ame common figure, habits, and in&s;tincts; and regard Egypt, in exclu&s;ion to every other country, as their proper abode <NOTE N="&#38;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Strabo places them al&s;o on a fre&s;h-water lake, near Lichas, in the extremity of Africa.</NOTE>. If it was carried abroad, they alledge, it lan|gui&s;hed out its days, con&s;umed by the de&s;ire of revi&s;iting its native &s;oil <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Aelian.</NOTE>. A bird &s;o ardently attached to its country, naturally became the emblem of it: the figure of the Ibis, in the hieroglyphics, denotes Egypt, and few images or characters are oftener repeated on all the mo|numents. They appear on mo&s;t of the obe|li&s;ks; on the ba&s;e of the &s;tatue of the Nile, at the Belvidere in Rome, and al&s;o in the garden of the Thuilleries at Paris. In the medal of Adrian, where Egypt appears pro&s;trate, the Ibis is placed at her &s;ide; and this bird is figured with an
<PB N="8" REF="15">
elephant in the medal of Quintus Marius, to &s;ignify Egypt and Lybia, the &s;cenes of his ex|ploits, &amp;c.</P>

we find it has a &s;trong appetite to feed on &s;er|pents, and even a &s;ort of antipathy to all rep|tiles. Belon a&s;&s;ures us that it continues to kill them, though &s;ated with prey. Diodorus Si|culus &s;ays, that night and day the Ibis, walking by the verge of the water, watches reptiles, &s;earching for their eggs, and de&s;troying the beetles and gra&s;shoppers which they meet. Accu&s;tomed to re&s;pectful treatment in Egypt, the&s;e birds advanced without fear into the mid&s;t of the cities. Strabo relates, that they filled the &s;treets and lanes of Alexandria to &s;uch a degree as to become trouble&s;ome and importunate, con|&s;uming indeed the filth, but al&s;o attacking pro|vi&s;ions, and defiling every thing with their dung: inconveniencies which would &s;hock the delicate and poli&s;hed Greek, though the Egyp|tians &s;o gro&s;sly &s;uper&s;titious, might cheerfully &s;ubmit to them.</P>

<P>THIS bird is &s;omewhat larger than the cur|lew, and &s;omewhat &s;maller than the &s;tork: its length from the point of the bill to the end of the nails is about three feet and an half. Herodotus de&s;cribes it as having tall naked legs; the face and front equally de&s;titute of feathers; the bill hooked; the quills of the tail and wings black, and the re&s;t of the plumage white. To the&s;e characters we &s;hall add &s;ome other properties not mentioned by the ancient hi&s;torian: The bill is rounded, and terminates in a blunt point; the neck is of an equal thick|ne&s;s throughout, and not clothed with pendant feathers like that of the &s;tork.</P>
<P>Perrault de&s;cribed and di&s;&s;ected one of the&s;e birds, which had lived in the <HI>menagerie</HI> at Ver|&s;ailles.

<PB N="14" REF="21">
bird, while tho&s;e of the Ibis were five parts. He ob&s;erved the &s;ame proportional difference to obtain between their bills and their necks. The wings appeared very large; their quills were black, and all the re&s;t of the plumage was white, inclined a little to ru&s;ty, and diver&s;ified only by &s;ome purple and reddi&s;h &s;pots under the wings; the top of the head, the orbits, and the under &s;ide of the throat, were void of feathers, but covered by a red wrinkled &s;kin; the bill was thick at the root, round, an inch and half in diameter, and curved the whole length; it was of a light yellow at its origin and deep orange near the extremity: the &s;ides of the bill were &s;harp, and &s;o hard that they might cut &s;erpents <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Corneo proceroque ro&s;tro.</HI> Cicero, <HI>uti &s;upra.</HI></NOTE>, which is probably the way that the bird takes to de&s;troy them; for the tip being blunt it could &s;carce pierce them.</P>
<P>The lower part of the legs was red, and mea|&s;ured more than four inches; though Belon, in his figure of the black ibis, repre&s;ents it as only one inch in length; both that part and the foot were entirely covered with hexagonal &s;cales. The &s;cales which incru&s;ted the toes were cut into tablets, and the nails were point|ed, &s;traight, and blacki&s;h. Both &s;ides of the mid-toe were bordered by the rudiments of a membrane, which, in the two other toes, ap|peared only on the in&s;ide.</P>
<P><PB N="15" REF="22">
Though the Ibis is not granivorous, its ven|tricle is a &s;ort of gizzard, who&s;e inner mem|brane is rough and wrinkled. We have more than once remarked this incongruity in the &s;tructure of birds; in the ca&s;&s;owary, for in&s;tance, which does not feed on fle&s;h, the &s;tomach is membranous like that of the eagle <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">An intere&s;ting circum&s;tance in this de&s;cription concerns the pa&s;&s;age of the chyle in the inte&s;tines of birds.

Perhaps, adds the anatomi&s;t, this pa&s;&s;age is common to all the tribe of birds; and as they exhibit no lacteal veins, we may ju&s;tly conjecture, that this is the cour&s;e of the chyle in pa&s;&s;ing from the inte&s;tines into the me&s;entery.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Perrault found the inte&s;tines to be four feet eight inches long; the heart was of a middling &s;ize, and not extremely large, as Merula pre|tended; the tongue, which was very &s;hort, and concealed at the bottom of the bill, was only a &s;mall cartilage inve&s;ted by a fle&s;hy membrane; which gave occa&s;ion to Solinus' remark, that this bird had no bill.

Their hatches begin in Ja|nuary and end in May; they lay their eggs, which are greeni&s;h, in the large plants that grow under the mangroves, or amid&s;t the bram|bles, on &s;ome &s;ticks collected. The young ones may ea&s;ily be caught by the hand, even when the mother leads them out to &s;earch for in&s;ects and &s;mall crabs, which are their principal food: they are not wild, and they &s;oon become recon|ciled to the dome&s;tic &s;tate. <Q>"I reared one," &s;ays M. de la Borde, &startq;which I have kept up|wards of two years; it fed out of my hand very familiarly, and never mi&s;&s;ed the time of dinner and &s;upper: it ate bread, fle&s;h either raw, dre&s;&s;ed, or &s;alted, fi&s;h, every thing in &s;hort was acceptable; it &s;howed however a pre|ference to fowls' and fi&s;hes' guts, and with that view it frequently paid a vi&s;it to the kitchen.

In &s;ome parts of France, the Lap|wing has the denomination of <HI>dix-huit</HI> (eigh|teen) becau&s;e the&s;e two &s;yllables, pronounced faintly, expre&s;s, with tolerable accuracy, its cry. which many languages have endeavoured to de|note by imitative &s;ounds <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Gyfytz, Giwitz, Kiwitz, Czieik,</HI> &amp;c.</NOTE>.

<P>The Lapwing is joyous, and perpetually in motion; it &s;ports and frolics a thou&s;and ways in the air; it a&s;&s;umes, at times, every imaginable po&s;ture, its belly &s;ometimes even turned upwards or &s;idewi&s;e, and its wings expanded perpendi|cularly; and no bird wheels and flickers &s;o nimbly.</P>
<P>The Lapwings arrive in our meadows in great flocks about the beginning of March, or even as early as the end of February, after the fir&s;t open weather, when the wind is &s;outherly. At this

&s;ea&s;on they alight in the fields of green corn <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon, Nat. des Oi&s;eaux, <HI>liv.</HI> iv. 17.</NOTE>, or in the morning cover the low mar&s;hy grounds in &s;earch of worms, which they dextrou&s;ly draw from their holes: when the bird meets with one of tho&s;e little clu&s;ters of pellets, or rolls of earth, which are thrown out by the worm's perfora|tions, it fir&s;t gently removes the mould from the mouth of the hole, &s;trikes the ground at the &s;ide with its foot, and &s;teadily and attentively waits the i&s;&s;ue; the reptile, alarmed by the &s;hock, emerges from its retreat, and is in&s;tantly &s;eized <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><P><Q>&startq;To a&s;certain this circum&s;tance," &s;ays M. Baillon, "I employed the &s;ame &s;tratagem: in a field of green corn, and in the garden, I beat the earth for a &s;hort time, and I &s;aw the worms coming out; I pre&s;&s;ed down a &s;take, which I then turned in all directions to &s;hake the &s;oil: this method, which is &s;aid to be u&s;ed by the cur|lews, &s;ucceeds &s;till quicker; the worms crawled out in crowds, even at the di&s;tance of a fathom from the &s;take.&endq;</Q></P></NOTE>. In the evening the Lapwings pur&s;ue a different plan; they run along the gra&s;s, and feel under their feet the worms, which now come forth, invited by the coolne&s;s of the air: thus they obtain a plentiful meal, and afterwards they wa&s;h their bill and feet in the &s;mall pools or rivulets.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are difficult to be approached, and &s;eem to de&s;cry the fowler at a great di&s;|tance: we can gain nearer them in a &s;trong wind, for then they fly with difficulty. When they are congregated and ready to ri&s;e together, they all flap their wings with an equal motion; and as they keep clo&s;e to each other, and their

under &s;ide is white, the ground, which was darkened by their numbers, appears at once white. But this great &s;ociety, which the&s;e birds form on their arrival, di&s;&s;olves when the vernal warmth invites to love, and in two or three days they di&s;per&s;e. The &s;ignal is given by battles between the males; the females &s;eem to avoid the contentions, and fir&s;t abandon the flock, as if unconcerned in the quarrels: but, in fact, they draw off the combatants to form a &s;weeter and more intimate union, which la&s;ts three months.</P>
<P>The hatch is conducted in April; it con&s;i&s;ts of three or four ablong eggs, of a dull green, much &s;potted with black: the&s;e are dropped in the mar&s;hes, on the little heads or clods of earth rai&s;ed above the &s;urface of the plain; a precau|tion which &s;eems nece&s;&s;ary to guard again&s;t the accidental &s;welling of the water, but which, however, leaves the ne&s;t expo&s;ed. To make a &s;ite for it, they are contented with cropping, clo&s;e to the &s;urface, a little round &s;pace in the gra&s;s, which &s;oon withers about it, from the heat of incubation; and if we find the gra&s;s fre&s;h and verdant, we may infer that the eggs have not been covered. It is &s;aid, that the&s;e eggs are good to eat, and in many provinces great quan|tities are gathered for market. But is it not an incroachment on the rights of nature, an inva|&s;ion on her property, to de&s;troy thus the tender germs of &s;pecies which we cannot multiply?
<PB N="51" REF="61">
The eggs of dome&s;tic poultry are in a manner our own creation, but tho&s;e of independent birds belong only to the common mother of all.</P>
<P>The incubation of the Lapwing, as in mo&s;t other birds, la&s;ts twenty days: the female &s;its a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly; if any thing alarms it, and drives it from its ne&s;t, it runs a little way, cowering through the gra&s;s, and does not ri&s;e till at a good di&s;tance from its eggs, that it may not betray the &s;pot. The old hens, who&s;e ne&s;ts have been robbed, will not again breed expo&s;ed in the mar&s;hes; they retire among the growing corn, and there in tranquillity make their &s;econd hatch: the young ones, le&s;s experienced, are not deterred by their lo&s;s, and they ri&s;k their ne&s;t a &s;econd, or even a third time in the &s;ame place; but the&s;e after|layings never exceed one or two eggs.</P>
<P>The young Lapwings, two or three days after being hatched, run among the gra&s;s and follow their parents: the&s;e from &s;olicitude often betray the little family, and di&s;cover the retreat, as they flutter backwards and forwards over the fowler's head with cries of inquietude, which are aug|mented as he approaches the &s;pot where the brood had &s;quatted on the fir&s;t alarm. When pu&s;hed to extremity they betake them&s;elves to running, and it is difficult to catch them with|out the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of a dog, for they are as alert as partridges. At this age they are covered with
<PB N="52" REF="62">
a blacki&s;h down, $aded under with long white hairs; but in Jul they drop this garb, and ac|quire their beaut$ful plumage.</P>
<P>The great a&s;&s;$ciation now begins to be re|newed: all the Lapwings of the &s;ame mar&s;h, young or old, a&s;&s;emble; tho&s;e of the adjacent mar&s;hes join them, and in a &s;hort time, a body of five or &s;ix hundred are collected. They hover in the air, &s;aunter in the meadows, and, after rain, they di&s;per&s;e among the plowed fields.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are reckoned incon&s;tant, and in|deed they &s;eldom remain above twenty-four hours in the &s;ame tract: but this volatility is occa&s;ioned by the &s;cantine&s;s of food; if the worms of a certain haunt be con&s;umed in one day, the flock mu&s;t remove on the following. In the month of October the Lapwings are very fat, and this is the time when they live in greate&s;t abun|dance; becau&s;e in this wet&s;ea&s;on the worms &s;warm on the &s;urface; but the cold winds which blow about the end of the month con&s;train them to retire into the earth, and thus oblige the Lap|wings to pa&s;s into another climate. This is the general cau&s;e of migration in the vermivorous birds. On the approach of winter, they advance towards the &s;outh, where the rains are only be|gun, and, for a like rea&s;on, they return in the &s;pring; the exce&s;&s;ive heat and dryne&s;s of the &s;ummer in tho&s;e latitudes having the &s;ame effect as great cold in confining the worms in

the ground <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Baillon, to whom we are indebted for the be&s;t details in this hi&s;tory of the Lapwing, confirms our idea with re&s;pect to the cau&s;e of the return of the Lapwing from &s;outh to north, by an ob&s;ervation which he made him&s;elf in the Antilles. <Q>"The ground," &s;ays he, &startq;is, during &s;ix months of the year, extremely hard and parched in the Antilles; not a &s;ingle drop of rain falls in the whole of that time; I have &s;een cracks in the valleys four inches broad, and &s;eve|ral feet deep; no worm can then live at the &s;urface; accordingly, in the dry &s;ea&s;on, no vermivorous bird is ob&s;erved in the&s;e in&s;tands; but on the fir&s;t days after the rains &s;et in, they arrive in &s;warms, and come, I &s;uppo&s;e, from the low deluged lands on the ea&s;tern &s;hores of Florida, from the Bahamas, and a multitude of other i&s;lands, lying north or north-we&s;t from the Antilles: all the&s;e wet places are the cradle of the water-fowl of the&s;e i&s;lands, and per|haps of a part of the great continent of America.&endq;</Q></NOTE>.

<P>THIS bird is by Belon termed the <HI>gray-plo|ver;</HI> and in fact it re&s;embles the plover as much as the lapwing, perhaps more: it has in|deed, like the latter, the &s;mall hind toe, which is wanting in the plover, a difference which has induced naturali&s;ts to &s;eparate the&s;e birds. But it mu&s;t be ob&s;erved that this toe is &s;maller than that of the lapwing, and hardly apparent; and that al&s;o it has &s;carce any of the colours of the lapwing. It might be regarded as a lapwing becau&s;e it has a fourth toe; or as a plover, be|cau&s;e it has no tuft, and &s;ince its habits and its garb are tho&s;e of the plovers.</P>
<P>Klein will not even admit that this &s;mall dif|ference in the toes is a general character, but ju&s;tly regards it as an anomaly; and he in&s;i&s;ts
<PB N="68" REF="78">
that the lapwings and plovers have &s;o many common characters as to con&s;titute only one great family. Accordingly, &s;ome naturali&s;ts have termed it a lapwing, others a plover: and, to compromi&s;e the matter, and retain the ana|logies, we have denominated it the <HI>Lapwing-Plover.</HI> Fowlers call it the <HI>&s;ea-plover,</HI> which is an improper appellation, &s;ince it con$orts with the common plovers; and Belon takes it to be the leader of their flocks, becau&s;e it has a louder and &s;tronger voice than the re&s;t. It is &s;ome|what larger than the golden plover; its bill is proportionally longer and &s;touter: all its plu|mage is light a&s;h-gray, and almo&s;t white under the body, mixed with browni&s;h &s;pots on the upper &s;ide of the body and on the &s;ides; the quills of the wing are blacki&s;h; the tail is &s;hort, and does not project beyond the wing.</P>
<P>Aldrovandus conjectures, with a good deal of probability, that this bird is mentioned by Ari&s;|totle under the name of <HI>pardalis.</HI> But we mu&s;t ob&s;erve that the philo&s;opher does not &s;eem to &s;peak of it as a bird with which he was him&s;elf acquainted; for the following are his expre&s;|&s;ions: <Q>&startq;The <HI>pardalis</HI> is &s;aid to be in a great mea&s;ure a gregarious bird, and never found alone; its plumage is entirely cinereous; it is, in point of &s;ize, next the <HI>molliceps;</HI> its pi|nions and feet are vigorous; its voice not deep, but frequent <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t.

<PB N="69" REF="79">
name <HI>pardalis</HI> &s;ignifies a mottled plumage. All the other properties belong equaily to the family of the plovers or of the lapwing.</P>
<P>Willughby a&s;&s;ures us, that this bird is &s;een frequently in the territories of the Venetian &s;tate, where it is called <HI>&s;quatarola.</HI> Mar&s;igli reckons it an inhabitant of the banks of the Danube. Schwenckfeld in&s;erts it in the num|ber of Sile&s;ian birds; Rzacyn&s;ki, in tho&s;e of Poland; and Sibbald, in tho&s;e of Scotland. Hence this &s;pecies, like all the lapwings, is ex|tremely diffu&s;ed. Does Linnaeus allude to any peculiarity of its hi&s;tory, when in one of his editions he denominates it <HI>tringa augu&s;ti men&s;is</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><HI>Sy&s;t. Nat.</HI> ed. 10.

<P>THE &s;ocial in&s;tinct is not be&s;towed on all the &s;pecies of birds; but, in tho&s;e which it cements, the union is firmer and more un&s;haken than in other animals; not only their flocks are more numerous and more con&s;tantly embo|died: the whole community &s;eems to have but one will; and the &s;ame appetites, projects, and plea&s;ures actuate each individual. Birds are more prolific than the quadrupeds, they live in greater plenty, and their motions are performed with greater ea&s;e and celerity. The compact|ne&s;s of their &s;quadrons, and the power of their voice, enable them to transfu&s;e their &s;entiments and intentions, and to act by mutual concert. And the &s;agacity exerci&s;ed in interpreting their &s;ignals begets among them affection, tru&s;t, and the gentle habits of peace and concord. The &s;ocieties of quadrupeds, whether formed volun|tarily in the wilds of nature, or contracted and upheld by the influence of man, cannot be com|pared with the congregations of the birds. Pi|geons grow fond of their common dwelling;
<PB N="72" REF="82">
and their attachment is the &s;tronger the more numerous their flock: quails a&s;&s;emble, and con|cert their migration: the gallinaceous tribes po&s;&s;e&s;s, even in the &s;avage &s;tate, tho&s;e &s;ocial ha|bits which dome&s;tication only nouri&s;hes and un|folds: la&s;tly, all the birds which &s;catter in the woods or di&s;per&s;e in the fields, gather together in the autumn; and after chearing the bright days of that late &s;ea&s;on with gay &s;port, they depart embodied, in que&s;t of milder winters and happier climates. All the&s;e combinations and movements of the feathered race are conducted independently of the guidance or controul of man, though performed under his eye. But his in|terference in the a&s;&s;ociations of quadrupeds di&s;|unites and di&s;per&s;es them. The marmot, form|ed by nature for &s;ociety, now lives &s;olitary and exiled on the &s;ummits of mountains; the bea|ver, di&s;po&s;ed &s;till more to friend&s;hip, and almo&s;t civilized, has been driven into the deepe&s;t wilds. Man has de&s;troyed or prevented all union among animals: that of the hor&s;e has been extingui&s;hed, and the whole &s;pecies &s;ub|jected to the rein <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The hor&s;es which have grown wild on the plains of Buenos-Ayres go in large flocks, run together, feed together, and give all the marks of mutual attachment and intelligence, and of delight|ing in &s;ociety.

Such in general are the companies of many water-fowls, and in particu|lar that of the Plovers.</P>
<P>They appear in numerous bodies in the pro|vinces of France during the autumnal rains, and from this circum&s;tance they derive their name <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">From <HI>pluvia,</HI> rain.

They frequent, like the lapwings, the wet bottoms and &s;limy grounds, where they &s;earch for worms and in&s;ects: they go into the water in the morning to wa&s;h their bill and feet, which are clotted with mud by their employ|ment; a habit which is common al&s;o to the woodcocks, the lapwings, the curlews, and many
<PB N="74" REF="84">
other birds which feed on worms. They &s;trike the ground with their feet to elicit the&s;e, and often they extract them from their retreat <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. Baillon, of Montreuil-&s;ur-mer.</NOTE>. Though the Plovers are u&s;ually very fat, their inte&s;tines are found to be &s;o empty, that it has been &s;uppo&s;ed that they could live on air; but it is probable that the &s;oft &s;ub&s;tance of the worms turns wholly into nouri&s;hment, and leaves little excrement. They &s;eem however capable of &s;upporting a long ab&s;tinence: Schwenckfeld &s;ays, that he kept one fourteen days, which during the whole time only drank &s;ome water, and &s;wallowed a few grains of &s;and.</P>
<P>Seldom do the Plovers remain more than twenty-four hours in the &s;ame place: as they are very numerous, they quickly con&s;ume the provi&s;ions which it affords, and are then obliged to remove to another pa&s;ture. The fir&s;t &s;nows compel them to leave our climates, and &s;eek milder regions: however, a con&s;iderable num|ber of them remain in our maritime provinces <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Picardy, according to M.

&s;een, &s;ays Longolius. And, according to Be|lon, their &s;malle&s;t companies amount at lea&s;t to fifty. When on the ground they never re&s;t, but are ince&s;&s;antly engaged in the &s;earch of food; they are almo&s;t perpetually in motion: &s;everal keep watch while the re&s;t of the flock are feed|ing, and on the lea&s;t &s;ymptom of danger they utter a &s;hrill &s;cream, which is the &s;ignal of flight. On wing, they follow the wind, and maintain a pretty &s;ingular arrangement; and thus advancing in front, they form in the air tran&s;ver&s;e zones, very narrow and exceedingly long: &s;ometimes there are &s;everal of the&s;e zones parallel, of &s;mall depth, but wide extended in cro&s;s lines.</P>
<P>When on the ground the&s;e birds run much, and very &s;wiftly; they continue in a flock the whole day, and only &s;eparate to pa&s;s the night: they di&s;per&s;e in the evening to a certain haunt, where each repo&s;es apart; but at day-break, the one fir&s;t awake or the mo&s;t watchful, which fowlers term the <HI>caller,</HI> though perhaps it is the &s;entinel, &s;ounds the cry <HI>hui, hieu, huit,</HI> and in an in&s;tant they obey the &s;ummons and collect to|gether. This is the time cho&s;en for catching them: a clap-net is &s;tretched before dawn fac|ing the place where they &s;leep; a number of fowlers encircle it, and as &s;oon as the call is heard, they throw them&s;elves flat on the ground till the birds gather; then they ri&s;e up, &s;hout, and throw their &s;ticks into the air; &s;o that the
<PB N="76" REF="86">
Plovers are frightened, and hurrying away with a low flight they &s;trike again&s;t the net, which drops upon them, and often the whole flock is taken. This plan is always attended with great &s;ucce&s;s; but a &s;ingle bird-catcher can in a &s;impler way en&s;nare con&s;iderable numbers: he conceals him&s;elf behind his net, and attracts the birds by means of a call of bark. They are caught in abundance in the plains of Beauce and of Champagne. Though very common in Italy, they are e&s;teemed excellent game: Belon &s;ays, that in his time a Plover was &s;old often as dea$ as a hare; he adds, that they preferred the young ones, which he calls <HI>guillemots.</HI></P>
<P>The cha&s;e of the Plovers, and their mode of living in that &s;ea&s;on, are almo&s;t the whole we know of their natural hi&s;tory. Tran&s;ient gue&s;ts rather than inhabitants of our fields, they di&s;ap|pear on the &s;now's falling; repa&s;s without halt|ing in the &s;pring, and leave us when the other birds arrive. It would &s;eem, that the gentle warmth of that &s;ea&s;on, which awakens the dor|mant faculties of the other birds, makes a con|trary impre&s;&s;ion on the Plovers: they proceed to the more northern countries to breed, and rear their young, for during the whole &s;ummer we never &s;ee them. Then they inhabit Lapland, and other parts of the north of Europe <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">See Collection Academique, <HI>partie $rangere,</HI> tome xi. <HI>Aca|demie de Stockholm,</HI> p. 60.</NOTE>, and
<PB N="77" REF="87">
probably tho&s;e of A&s;ia. Their progre&s;s is the &s;ame in America; &s;ince they are common to both continents, and are ob&s;erved in the &s;pring at Hud&s;on's Bay advancing farther north <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Hi&s;t. Gen. des Voy. <HI>tom.</HI> xv. <HI>p.</HI> 267.</NOTE>. After arriving in flocks in tho&s;e arctic tracts, they &s;eparate into pairs; and the more intimate union of love breaks, or rather &s;u&s;pends for a time, the general &s;ociety of friend&s;hip. Hence Klein, an inhabitant of Dantzick, remarks, that the Plovers live &s;olitary in low grounds and meadows.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies which in our climates appears as numerous at lea&s;t as that of the lapwing, is le&s;s diffu&s;ed. According to Aldrovandus, fewer Plovers are caught in Italy than lapwings, and they are not found in Switzerland and other countries, where the lapwings are frequent. But perhaps the Plover, advancing farther to the north than the lapwing, gains as much terri|tory as it relinqui&s;hes in the &s;outh. It &s;eems al&s;o to have occupied a &s;pacious tract in the new world, which has afforded an ample range to many &s;pecies of birds, becau&s;e there the temperature is more uniform throughout, and the climates more ob&s;curely di&s;criminated.</P>
<P>The Golden Plover may be regarded as the repre&s;entative of the whole family of Plovers; and what we have &s;aid of their habits and oeco|nomy refer to it: but &s;pecies are included, which we proceed to enumerate and de&s;cribe.</P>

<HEAD>THE THICK KNEED BUSTARD.</HEAD>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="103" REF="116">
it has &s;everal peculiar features and habits, that disjoin it from the other &s;pecies.</P>
<P>This bird is much larger than the golden plover, and even exceeds the woodcock: its thick legs have a remarkable &s;welling below the knee; for which rea&s;on Belon has applied the epithet <HI>oedicnemus</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Formed from <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, to &s;well, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the upper part of the leg or knee.</NOTE>. Like the plover it has only three toes, which are very &s;hort: its legs and feet are yellow; its bill yellowi&s;h from the origin to the middle, and from thence blacki&s;h to the extremity; and is of the &s;ame &s;hape with that of the plover, only thicker: all the plumage is of a light gray and ru&s;ty-gray ground, and &s;peckled with da&s;hes of brown and blacki&s;h, the &s;trokes very di&s;tinct on the neck and brea&s;t, and more confu&s;ed on the back and the wings, which are cro&s;&s;ed with a whiti&s;h bar: two &s;treaks of ru&s;ty white pa&s;s above and below the eye: the ground is ru&s;ty colour on the back and neck, and white under the belly, which is not &s;peckled.</P>
<P>This bird has great power of wing; it &s;prings at a di&s;tance, e&s;pecially in the day-time, and flies pretty near the ground: it runs on the &s;ward and in the fields, as &s;wiftly as a dog; and hence, in &s;ome provinces, it has been termed <HI>the &s;urveyor</HI> (arpenteur.) After running, it &s;tops &s;hort, holding its body and head &s;till <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Albin.</NOTE>; and on
<PB N="104" REF="117">
the lea&s;t noi&s;e it &s;quats on the ground. Flies, beetles, &s;mall &s;nails, &amp;c. are its chief food, toge|ther with &s;ome other in&s;ects that are found in fallow grounds, &s;uch as crickets, gra&s;shoppers, &amp;c. <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">M. Baillon, who has ob&s;erved this bird on the coa&s;ts of Picardy, informs us, that it al&s;o eats little black lizards, which it finds on the downs, and even &s;mall adders.</NOTE>: for it con&s;tantly inhabits the brows of banks, and prefers the &s;tony, &s;andy, and dry &s;pots. In Beauce, Salerne tells us, bad land is called <HI>curlew-land.</HI> The&s;e birds, &s;olitary and tranquil during the day, begin to &s;tir on the ap|proach of the evening; then they &s;pread on all &s;ides, flying rapidly, and crying on the heights with all their might: their voice, which is heard at a great di&s;tance, re&s;embles the &s;ound of a third flute, dwelling on three or four tones, from a flat to a &s;harp. This is the time that they approach our dwellings <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Sloane.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e nocturnal habits &s;eem to &s;hew, that this bird &s;ees better in the night than in the day; yet is its &s;ight very acute in the day-time: the po&s;ition too of its large eyes enables it to &s;ee as well before as behind: it de&s;cries the &s;port&s;man at a good di&s;tance, &s;o that it can ri&s;e and e&s;cape before he gets within &s;hot of it. It is as wild as it is timorous; fear alone confines it during the day, and permits it not to come abroad or utter its cries till night: and &s;o invin|cible is its timidity, that if a per&s;on enter the
<PB N="105" REF="118">
room where it is kept, it endeavours to conceal it&s;elf, or &s;neak off, and runs again&s;t whatever happens to be in its way. It is &s;aid, that this bird fore&s;ees the changes of the weather, and an|nounces rain: Ge&s;ner remarks, that even when confined, it is much di&s;turbed before a &s;torm.</P>
<P>This Great Plover, or Stone Curlew, forms an exception to the numerous &s;pecies, which having a part of their leg naked, are reckoned inhabi|tants of &s;hores and boggy grounds; &s;ince it keeps ever at a di&s;tance from water or mar&s;hes, and re&s;ides in dry upland &s;ituations <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">We may hence &s;ee with what little rea&s;on Ge&s;ner took it for the <HI>charadrios</HI> of Ari&s;totle, which is decidedly a &s;hore bird. See the article of the <HI>Ring-Plover.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e are not the only habits in which they differ from the plovers. The &s;ea&s;ons of their migrations are not the &s;ame; for they retire in November, during the latter rains of autumn, having, previous to their departure, which com|mences at night <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Salerne.</NOTE>, collected at the call of their leader, in flocks of three or four hundred; and they return early in the &s;pring, being &s;een in the end of March in Beauce, Sologne, Berry, and &s;ome other provinces of France. The female lays only two, or &s;ometimes three eggs, on the naked ground, between &s;tones <NOTE N="&#38;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>, or in a &s;mall hole which &s;he forms in the &s;and of heaths or
<PB N="106" REF="119">
downs <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">During the eight days which I wandered on the dry &s;ands that cover the &s;ea-&s;hore from the mouth of the Somme to the extremity of the Boulonnois, I met with a ne&s;t which appeared to be that of the <HI>&s;aint-germer</HI> (&s;tone-curlew). To a&s;certain this, I remained &s;it|ting on the &s;and till evening, having rai&s;ed a little hillock in front to conceal my&s;elf. The birds which inhabit tho&s;e &s;ands being ac|cu&s;tomed to &s;ee the &s;urface perpetually changed by the wind, are not in the lea&s;t di&s;turbed at finding new cavities or elevations. My trouble was recompen&s;ed: in the evening the bird came to her eggs, and I recognized it to be the <HI>&s;aint-germer,</HI> or &s;tone-curlew: her ne&s;t placed expo&s;ed on a flat in a &s;and-plain, con&s;i&s;ted only of a little hole of an inch, and of an eliptical &s;hape, containing three eggs, pretty large, and of a &s;ingular colour. <HI>Ob&s;ervation made by M. Baillon, of Montreuil-&s;ur-mer.</HI></NOTE>. The male pur&s;ues her eagerly in the love &s;ea&s;on; he is as con&s;tant as he is ardent, and never de&s;erts her: he a&s;&s;i&s;ts in leading the young, and in&s;tructing them to di&s;tingui&s;h their food. The education is tedious; for though the brood can &s;oon walk after they are hatched, it is a con&s;iderable time before they have &s;trength &s;ufficient to fly. Belon found &s;ome that could not u&s;e their wings in the end of October; which induced him to &s;uppo&s;e that the eggs are laid at a late &s;ea&s;on. But the Chevalier De&s;mazy, who ob&s;erved the&s;e birds at Malta <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">In Malta it is called <HI>tolaride.</HI></NOTE>, informs us, that they have regularly two hatches, one in the &s;pring, and another in the end of Augu&s;t. He al&s;o a&s;&s;ures us, that the incubation la&s;ts thirty days. The young ones are excellent game, and the adults likewi&s;e are eaten, though their fle&s;h is blacker and dryer. The cha&s;e of
<PB N="107" REF="120">
the &s;tone curlews was re&s;erved in Malta for the ma&s;ter, before the introduction of our partridges, about the middle of la&s;t century <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">In the time of the grand ma&s;ter, Martin de Redin.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds do not, like the plovers, advance into the north in &s;ummer; at lea&s;t Linnaeus has not in&s;erted them in his <HI>Fauna Suecica.</HI> Wil|lugh by a&s;&s;ures us, that in England they are found in Norfolk and in Cornwall; yet Charleton, who gives him&s;elf out for an experienced &s;port&s;man, confe&s;&s;es that he never met with any. Indeed, the wild di&s;po&s;ition of the &s;tone curlew, and its retirement during the day, might long conceal it from the eyes of ob&s;ervers; and Belon, who fir&s;t di&s;covered it in France, remarks that no per&s;on could then tell him its name.</P>
<P>I had one of the&s;e birds a month or five weeks at my hou&s;e in the country. It fed on &s;oup, bread, and raw fle&s;h, and preferred the la&s;t. It a$e not only in the day-time, but al&s;o at night; for its provi&s;ion, when given in the evening, was ob&s;erved to be dimini&s;hed next morning.</P>
<P>This bird &s;eemed to me of a peaceful temper, but timorous and wild; and I am induced to think that this is really the ca&s;e, as it is &s;eldom &s;een in the day, and prefers the ob&s;curity of night for its a&s;&s;ociations. I ob&s;erved, that as &s;oon as it perceived a per&s;on, even at a di&s;tance, it endeavoured to e&s;cape, and was &s;o overcome with fear, as to hurt it&s;elf in the flurry. It is, therefore, one of tho&s;e birds which nature has
<PB N="108" REF="121">
de&s;tined to live remote from us, and has endued with the in&s;tinct for that purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>The one which I mention uttered no cry; it only made, two or three nights before its death, a &s;ort of feeble whi&s;tle, which was perhaps an expre&s;&s;ion of pain, for the root of its bill and its feet were much ga&s;hed, owing to its violent &s;truggling in the cage, at the &s;ight of any new object. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the Thick-knee'd Bu&s;tard, <HI>Charadrius Oedicnemus:</HI> <Q>&startq;It is gray; its two primary wing-quills black, and in the middle white; its bill &s;harp; its feet cinereous.&endq;</Q>The&s;e birds are very frequent in Norfolk; they breed in rabbit burrows; their eggs are olive, with reddi&s;h &s;pots.</NOTE></P>

<P>THOSE birds which di&s;per&s;e in our fields or retire under the &s;hade of our fore&s;ts, inha|bit the mo&s;t enchanting &s;cenes, and the mo&s;t peaceful retreats of nature.

a few birds, &s;uch as the Oy&s;ter-catcher, obtain &s;ub&s;i&s;tance and &s;ecurity, and even enjoy plea&s;ure and love. It lives on &s;ea-worms, oy&s;ters, lim|pets, and other bivalves, which it gathers on the &s;and of the &s;ea-&s;hore: it keeps con&s;tantly on the banks, which are left dry at low water, or on the little channels, where it follows the refluent tide; and never retires farther than the &s;andy hillocks which limit the beach. This bird has al&s;o been called the <HI>&s;ea-pie,</HI> not only on account of its plumage, which is black and white, but becau&s;e it makes a continual noi&s;e or cry, e&s;pe|cially when it is in flocks: this cry is &s;hrill and abrupt, repeated ince&s;&s;antly whether at re&s;t or on the wing.</P>
<P>This bird is &s;eldom &s;een on mo&s;t of the French coa&s;ts; yet it is known in Saintonge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Belon.</NOTE>, and in Picardy <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M.

<P><PB N="116" REF="131">
This bird is as large as the crow; its bill four inches long, contracted, and, as it were, com|pre&s;&s;ed vertically above the no&s;trils, and flatten|ed at the &s;ides like a wedge as far as the tip, who&s;e &s;quare &s;ection forms a cutting edge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Le Page du Pratz, <HI>ut &s;upra.</HI></NOTE>: a &s;tructure peculiar to it&s;elf, and which enables its bill to rai&s;e up and detach the oy&s;ters, limpets and other &s;hell-fi&s;h from their beds and ro$ks.</P>
<P>The Oy&s;ter-catcher is one of tho&s;e few birds which have only three toes. This &s;ingle cir|cum&s;tance has led &s;y&s;tematic writers to range it next the bu&s;tard. Yet it is apparent how wide is the &s;eparation in the order of nature; for not only this bird haunts the &s;ea-&s;hores, it even &s;wims, though its feet are almo&s;t entirely devoid of membranes. It is true that, according to M. Baillon, who ob&s;erved the Oy&s;ter-catcher on the coa&s;ts of Picardy, its method of &s;wimming is merely pa&s;&s;ive, but it has no aver&s;ion to re|po&s;e on the water, and leaves the &s;ea for the land whenever it choo&s;es.</P>
<P>Its black and white plumage, and its long bill, have given occa&s;ion to the inaccurate appella|tions of <HI>&s;ea-pie</HI> and <HI>&s;ea-woodcock:</HI> the name <HI>Oy&s;ter-catcher</HI> is proper, &s;ince it expre&s;&s;es its mode of &s;ub&s;i&s;ting. Cate&s;by found oy&s;ters in its &s;tomach, and Willughby entire limpets. The organ of di|ge&s;tion is &s;pacious and mu&s;cular, according to
<PB N="117" REF="132">
Belon; who adds, that the fle&s;h of the bird is black and hard, and of a rank ta&s;te. Yet M. Baillon avers, that the Oy&s;ter-catcher is always fat in the winter, and that the young ones are tolerably plea&s;ant food. He kept one more than two months in his garden, where it lived chiefly on earth-worms like the curlews, but al&s;o ate raw fle&s;h and bread, with which it was well content. It drank indifferently either &s;alt or fre&s;h water, without &s;hewing the lea&s;t preference to either: yet in the &s;tate of nature the&s;e birds never inhabit the mar&s;hes or the mouths of ri|vers; they remain con&s;tantly on or near the beach; probably becau&s;e fre&s;h waters do not afford the proper &s;ub&s;i&s;tence.</P>
<P>The Oy&s;ter-catcher makes no ne&s;t; its eggs, which are grayi&s;h and &s;potted with black, it lays on the naked &s;and, out of the reach of the tide, but without any preparation for their reception; it only &s;eems to &s;elect a high &s;pot, &s;trewed with fragments of &s;hells. The number of eggs is u&s;ually four or five, and the time of incubation is twenty or twenty-one days: the female does not cover them a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly; &s;he &s;eems, in this re&s;pect, to do as mo&s;t of the birds that inhabit the &s;ea-&s;hores, and to leave the hatch to the &s;un's heat part of the day, leaving her charge at nine or ten o'clock of the morning, and not returning, unle&s;s on occa&s;ion of rain, till three in the afternoon.

<P>The bill and feet of the Oy&s;ter-catcher are of a fine coral red: hence Belon has called it <HI>haematopus</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, blood, and <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, the foot.</NOTE>, taking it for the <HI>himantopus</HI> of Pliny; but the&s;e two names ought not to be confounded, or applied to the &s;ame bird. The former &s;ignifies <HI>red legs,</HI> and might be referred to the Oy&s;ter-catcher; but it is not found in Pliny, though Dalechamp reads it &s;o: and the latter, expre&s;&s;ive of tall, frail, and &s;lender legs, belongs not to the Oy&s;ter-catcher, but to the long-&s;hank.

<P>Willughby, in cautioning us not to confound this bird, under the name of <HI>haemantopus,</HI> with the himantopus with long and delicate legs, &s;eems to point out another mi&s;take of Belon's; who, in his de&s;cription of the Oy&s;ter-catcher, attributes to it this delicacy of feet, incompatible, it would &s;eem, with its mode of life, which obliges it to clamber on the edges of rocks.

<P>THE two birds repre&s;ented in N^o^s 795 and 892 of our <HI>Pl. Enl.</HI> are of a new genus, which required a di&s;tinct name. They re&s;em|ble the plover in the feet, which have only three toes, but differ in the &s;hape of the bill, which is curved, whereas that of the plovers is &s;traight and inflated near the end. The fir&s;t was killed in France, where it had probably &s;trayed, &s;ince no other has been &s;een. It ran with rapidity along the &s;hore, and hence it de|rived its name.

Both of them have larger legs than the plovers; they are as large, but not &s;o thick; their toes are very &s;hort, particularly the two lateral ones. The plumage of the fir&s;t is gray, wa&s;hed with rufous brown; on the eye

is a lighter &s;treak, almo&s;t white, which &s;tretches backwards, and below it a black &s;treak ri&s;ing from the outer angle of the eye: the top of the head is rufous; the quills of the wing are black, and each feather of the tail, except the two middle ones, has a black &s;pot, with another white one near the point.</P>

<P>WE adopt the name <HI>Turn-&s;tone,</HI> given by Cate&s;by, becau&s;e it indicates the &s;ingular habit which this bird has of turning over the &s;tones at the water's-edge, to di&s;cover the worms and in&s;ects that lurk under the&s;e; whereas all the other &s;hore-birds content them&s;elves with &s;earching in the &s;and or mud. <Q>"Being at &s;ea," &s;ays Cate&s;by, &startq;forty leagues from Florida, in the latitude of 31 degrees, a bird flew on our &s;hip, and was caught. It was very alert in turning the &s;tones that lay be&s;ide it: in doing &s;o, it u&s;ed only its upper mandible, and was able to turn over very nimbly &s;tones of three pounds weight <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Carolina, vol. i. p. 72.</NOTE>.&endq;</Q> This action implies &s;ingular force and dexterity in a bird which is hardly &s;o large as the du&s;ky &s;andpiper.
<PB N="124" REF="140">
It has a bill of a harder and more horny &s;ub|&s;tance than the other little &s;hore-birds, and it forms a &s;mall family amid that numerous tribe: the bill is thick at the root, and gradually tapers to a point: the upper-part is &s;omewhat com|pre&s;&s;ed, and appears to ri&s;e with a &s;light curve: it is black, and an inch long: the feet have no membranes, are pretty &s;hort, and of an orange-colour.</P>
<P>The plumage of the Turn-&s;tone re&s;embles that of the ringed plover, in the white and black which inter&s;ect it, but without tracing di&s;tinctly a collar, and in the mixture of rufous on the back. This &s;imilarity in its colours has proba|bly mi&s;led Brown, Willughby, and Ray, who have given it the appellation <HI>morinellus</HI> (dotterel); though it is of a kind entirely di&s;tinct from the plovers, being furni&s;hed with a fourth toe and a differently &s;haped bill.</P>
<P>The &s;pecies of the Turn-&s;tone is common to both continents. It is known on the we&s;t coa&s;t of England, where the&s;e appear generally in &s;mall companies of three or four <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>.

and e&s;pecially in the pebbly channels of clear rivulets <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The Water-Ouzel has a very wide mouth; its feathers are grea&s;y like the ducks, which enables it the ea&s;ier to dive under water for aquatic in&s;ects: it forms its ne&s;t with mo&s;s near rivulets, and fa|&s;hions it like a vault: its eggs are four in number. <HI>Extract of a let|ter from Dr. Hermann to M. de Montbeillard, dated Stra&s;burg, 22d Sep|tember</HI> 1774.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>Its habits are very &s;ingular. Aquatic birds with palmated feet &s;wim or dive; tho&s;e which inhabit the &s;hores, without wetting their body, wade with their tall legs; but the Water-Ouzel walks quite into the flood, following the declivity of the ground: it is ob&s;erved to enter by degrees, till the water reaches its neck; and it &s;till advances, holding its head not higher than u&s;ual, though completely immer&s;ed: it continues to walk under the water, and even de&s;cends to the bottom, where it &s;aunters as on the dry bank. We are indebted to M. Hebert for the fir&s;t account of this extraordinary habit, which I know not to belong to any other bird. I &s;hall here give the ob&s;ervations which he was plea&s;ed to communicate to me.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;I lay ambu&s;hed on the verge of the lake Nantua, in a hut formed of pine-branches and &s;now, where I patiently waited till a boat, which was rowing on the lake, &s;hould drive &s;ome wild-ducks to the water's edge. I ob|&s;erved without being perceived: before me was a &s;mall inlet, the bottom of which gently
<PB N="128" REF="145">
&s;helved, and might be about two or three feet deep in the middle. A Water-Ouzel &s;topped here more than an hour, and I had full lei&s;ure to view its manoeuvres. It entered into the water, di&s;appeared, and again emerged on the other &s;ide of the inlet, which it thus repeat|edly forded. It traver&s;ed the whole of the bot|tom, and &s;eemed not to have changed its ele|ment, and di&s;covered no he&s;itation or reluc|tance in the immer&s;ion. However, I per|ceived &s;everal times, that as often as it waded deeper than the knee, it di&s;played its wings, and allowed them to hang to the ground. I remarked, too, that when I could di&s;cern it at the bottom of the water, it appeared inveloped with air, which gave it a brilliant &s;urface; like &s;ome &s;orts of beetles, which are always in wa|ter, inclo&s;ed with a bubble of air. Its view in dropping its wings on entering the water, might be to confine this air; it was certainly never without &s;ome, and it &s;eemed to quiver. The&s;e &s;ingular habits of the Water-Ouzel were unknown to all the &s;port&s;men whom I have talked with; and, perhaps, without the accident of the &s;now-hut, I &s;hould have ever been ignorant of them: but I can aver, that the bird came to my very feet, and, that I might ob&s;erve it, I did not kill it <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Note communicated by M. Hebert to M. le Comte de Buffon,</NOTE>.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>The hi&s;tory of birds pre&s;ents few facts more curious than the foregoing. Linnaeus had

rightly &s;aid, that the Water-Ouzel de&s;cends into the &s;treams, and again emerges with much dexterity; <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Fauna Suecica.</NOTE>; and Willughby had remarked that, though cloven-footed, this bird dived: but nei|ther of them &s;eems to have known that it plunged in order to walk on the bottom. We may ea&s;ily &s;uppo&s;e, that for this purpo&s;e a peb|bly channel and clear water are requi&s;ite, and that a &s;limy ground would be altogether impro|per.

<P>IN wet meadows, from the time the gra&s;s is grown till it be cut down, there i&s;&s;ues from the thicke&s;t part of the herbage a raucous voice, or rather a broken, har&s;h cry, <HI>cr&ebreve;k, cr&ebreve;k, cr&ebreve;k,</HI> much like the noi&s;e made by &s;tripping forcibly the teeth of a large comb under the fingers: as we approach the &s;ound retires, and is heard at a

remove of fifty paces. It is the Land Rail that emits this cry, which might be taken for the croaking of a reptile <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Longolius, <HI>apud Ge&s;nerum.</HI></NOTE>. This bird &s;eldom e&s;|capes by flight, but almo&s;t always walks nimbly through the thicke&s;t gra&s;s, where it leaves a re|markable track. It begins to be heard about the 10th or 12th of May, at the &s;ame time with the quails, which it &s;eems ever to accompany <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">They arrive and retire together, according to Longolius.</NOTE>. Hence, as the quails too inhabit meadows, and as the Land Rail is le&s;s common, and rather larger, it has been &s;uppo&s;ed to be their leader <NOTE N="&#38;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ari&s;totle, <HI>Hi&s;t.

<P>A gratuitous exten&s;ion of the imaginary ana|logy between the Land Rail and the quail has likewi&s;e impre&s;&s;ed the notion of an equal fecun|dity.
<PB N="139" REF="157">
But, from repeated ob&s;ervations, we are a&s;&s;ured, that it &s;eldom lays eight or ten eggs, never eighteen or twenty, as &s;uppo&s;ed: indeed, were we to admit &s;uch multiplication, the &s;pe|cies would be more numerous, con&s;idering how well the ne&s;t is concealed. This ne&s;t is negli|gently con&s;tructed with a little mo&s;s or dry gra&s;s, and placed u&s;ually in &s;ome &s;mall hollow in the turf: the eggs, larger than tho&s;e of the quail, are &s;prinkled with broader reddi&s;h &s;pots. The young crakes run as &s;oon as they bur&s;t the &s;hell, following their mother, but quit not the meadow till the &s;cythe &s;weeps away their habi|tation. The late hatches are plundered by the hands of the mower. All the other broods then &s;helter them&s;elves in the fields of buck|wheat, among oats, and in wa&s;te grounds over|&s;pread with broom, where they are found often in &s;ummer: a few return again to the meadows about the end of that &s;ea&s;on.</P>
<P>We may know when a dog lights on the &s;cent of the Land Rail, from his keen &s;earch, his number of fal&s;e tracks, and the ob&s;tinacy with which the bird per&s;i&s;ts in keeping the ground, in&s;omuch that it may be &s;ometimes caught by the hand: it often &s;tops &s;hort, and &s;quats down; the dog pu&s;hing eagerly forward, over&s;hoots the &s;pot, and lo&s;es the trace; the Rail, it is &s;aid, pro|fits by his blunder, and runs back on its path; nor does it &s;pring till driven to the la&s;t extre|mity, and then it ri&s;es to a good height before

it &s;tretches onwards. It flies heavily, and never to a great di&s;tance.

The fleetne&s;s of its feet compen&s;ates for the tardine&s;s of its wings: all its little excur&s;ions, its windings, and its doublings in the fields and meadows, are performed by running.

&s;inks with the water. It lays &s;even or eight eggs; and the floating young are hatched all black. Their education is &s;peedy; for they run, &s;wim, dive, and &s;oon &s;eparate, each to lead a &s;o|litary, &s;avage life, which prevails even in the &s;ea&s;on of love: &s;ince, except during actual coi|tion, the male di&s;cards his female, pays no ten|der attentions or care&s;&s;es, indulges in no frolics or joyous airs, and feels none of tho&s;e &s;oft de|lights, the &s;weet preludes of fruition. Unhappy beings, who never breathe a &s;igh to the objects of their pa&s;&s;ion! in&s;ipid loves, who&s;e &s;ole end is to procure po&s;terity!</P>
<P>Its habits wild, its in&s;tinct &s;tupid, the <HI>Marouette</HI> is un&s;u&s;ceptible of education, nor is even ca|pable of being tamed. We rai&s;ed one, how|ever, which lived a whole &s;ummer on crumbs of bread and hemp-&s;eed: when by it&s;elf, it kept con&s;tantly in a large bowl of water; but if a per&s;on entered the clo&s;et where it was &s;hut, it ran to conceal it&s;elf in a &s;mall dark corner, without venting cries or murmurs. In the &s;tate of liberty, however, it has a &s;harp piercing voice, much like the &s;cream of a young bird of prey: and though it has no propen&s;ity to &s;ociety, as &s;oon as one cries, another repeats the &s;ound, which is thus conveyed through all the re&s;t in the di&s;trict.</P>
<P>The <HI>Marouette,</HI> like all the rails, is &s;o ob&s;ti|nately aver&s;e to ri&s;e, that the &s;port&s;man often &s;eizes it with his hand, or fells it with a &s;tick.
<PB N="149" REF="168">
If it finds a bu&s;h in its retreat, it climbs upon it, and from the top of its a&s;ylum beholds the dogs bru&s;hing along in fault: this habit is common to it and to the water rail. It dives, &s;wims, and even &s;wims under water, when hard pu&s;hed.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds di&s;appear in the depth of winter, but return early in the &s;pring; and even in the month of February they are common in &s;ome provinces of France and Italy.

<P>IF we attended only to the &s;hape of the bill and feet, we &s;hould reckon this bird a rail; but its tail is much longer, and we have therefore adopted a compound name, expre&s;&s;ive of this character, <HI>Caur&acirc;le</HI> or <HI>Queue R&acirc;le</HI> (tail-rail). Its plumage is rich, though the colours are dark: to form an idea of it, we may compare it to the wings of tho&s;e fine &s;hining flies, in which black, brown, rufous, fulvous, and light gray, inter|mingled in zones and zig-zags, compo&s;e a &s;oft enchanting mixture. Such particularly is the plumage of the wings and tail; the head is hooded with black, and there are long white lines above and below the eye; the bill is ex|actly that of the rail, except that it is rather longer; and the head, the neck, and the body are al&s;o longer than in the rail; the tail is five inches, and projects two beyond the wings; the foot is thick, twenty-&s;ix lines high, and the

<PB N="164" REF="185">
its conformation: it is oftener in the water than the rail, though it does not &s;wim much, but only cro&s;&s;es from one &s;ide to another. It lurks the greate&s;t part of the day among the reeds, or under the roots of alders, willows, and oziers, and leaves not its retreat until evening: it frequents le&s;s the mar&s;hes and bogs than the rivers and pools. Its ne&s;t is placed clo&s;e to the brink of the water, and con&s;tructed with a large heap of broken reeds and ru&s;hes interwoven. The mother quits her ne&s;t every evening, hav|ing previou&s;ly covered the eggs with herbs and ru&s;hes. The young run as &s;oon as they are hatched, like tho&s;e of the rail, and in the &s;ame way are led by their dam to the water: and, no doubt, it is for this rea&s;on that the parents, con|&s;ulting future convenience, always build their ne&s;t &s;o near the &s;urface.

<P>We know four or five Jacanas, which are of the &s;ame bulk, and differ only in colour. The fir&s;t &s;pecies given by Fernandez is the fourth of Marcgrave. The head, the neck, and the fore|&s;ide of the body of this bird, are black tinged with violet; the great quills of the wing are greeni&s;h; the re&s;t of the upper &s;urface is fine che&s;nut, with a purpli&s;h or ferruginous ca&s;t: each wing is armed with a pointed &s;pur in&s;erted in the &s;houlder, exactly like the &s;pines of the cri&s;ped ray-fi&s;h; a membrane, taking its origin at the root of the bill, &s;preads on the front, and divides into three portions, leaving al&s;o a barbel on each &s;ide; the bill is &s;traight, inflated &s;ome|what at the point, and of a fine yellow jonquil, like the &s;purs; the tail is very &s;hort, and this character, as well as the form of the bill, the tail, the toes, and the height of the legs, of which the half is covered with feathers, belongs equally to all the &s;pecies of Jacanas. Marcgrave &s;eems to exaggerate, when he compares their bulk to that of a pigeon; for their body is not larger than the quail, only their legs are much taller; their neck is al&s;o longer, and their head

<P><Q>"The&s;e birds," he &s;ays, &startq;go commonly in pairs, and when &s;eparated by &s;ome accident they call each other: they are very wild, and the &s;port&s;man cannot approach them but by wiles, covering him&s;elf with leaves, or running behind the bu&s;hes or the reeds. They are &s;een regularly in St. Domingo during the rainy months of May and November, or &s;hortly after: yet a few are &s;een at other times, which would &s;hew that the places of their habitual abode are not very remote. But they are never found except in mar&s;hes,&endq; or at the &s;ides of pools and brooks.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;The flight of the&s;e birds is not lofty, but pretty rapid: in ri&s;ing they vent a &s;hrill, &s;queaking cry, which is heard far, and &s;eems to bear &s;ome re&s;emblance to that of the white owl.

According to the reading of Athenaeus, Ari&s;totle &s;ubjoined that it had five toes; which would have been erro|neous, though &s;ome other ancient authors have alledged it. But among the moderns, I&s;idorus has fallen into a much greater error, which has been copied by Albertus, who &s;ays that one of its feet is webbed and calculated for &s;wimming, and that the other is fitted for running like the land birds: which is equally fal&s;e and ab&s;urd, and mu&s;t mean nothing more than that the Porphyrion is a &s;hore bird, and lives on the confines of the land and water.

<P>Now if we compare this Porphyrion of the ancients with our Sultana Hen, figured in N&deg; 810, <HI>Planches Enlumin&eacute;es,</HI> it appears that this bird, which was brought to us from Madaga&s;car un|der the name of <HI>taleve</HI> <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">The <HI>taleva</HI> is a river bird of the bulk of a hen, which has many violet feathers; and its front, its bill, and its feet red.

The academicians, who have de&s;cribed a &s;imilar one, recognized al&s;o the Porphyrion in the Sul|tana Hen. It is about two feet long from the bill to the claws: the toes are extremely long, and completely parted, without the lea&s;t ve&s;tige of membrane: they are di&s;po&s;ed as u&s;ual, three before and one behind; and Ge&s;ner was mi&s;|taken when he repre&s;ented them as placed two and two: the neck is very &s;hort in proportion to the length of the legs, which are featherle&s;s: the feet are very long; the tail is very &s;hort; the bill is &s;haped like a flat cone at the &s;ides, and is pretty &s;hort: the la&s;t property which charac|teri&s;es this bird is, that its front is bald, like that of the coot's, and covered with a plate, which, extending to the top of the head, &s;preads into an oval, and &s;eems to be formed by the production of the horny &s;ub&s;tance of the bill. This is
<PB N="190" REF="213">
what Ari&s;totle expre&s;&s;es in Athenaeus, by &s;aying that the Porphyrion has its bill &s;trongly attached to its head. The academicians found two pretty large <HI>caeca,</HI> which expanded into &s;acs; and the inflation of the lower part of the <HI>ae&s;ophagus</HI> &s;eems to &s;upply the place of a craw, which, Pliny &s;ays, is wanting in this bird.</P>
<P>This Sultana Hen, de&s;cribed by the Acade|micians, is the fir&s;t bird of the kind that has been &s;een by the moderns. Ge&s;ner &s;peaks only from report, and from a drawing of it: Wil|lughby &s;ays, that no naturali&s;t has &s;een the Por|phyrion. We owe to the Marquis de Ne&s;le the plea&s;ure of having &s;een it alive; and we expre&s;s our mo&s;t re&s;pectful thanks for what we regard as a debt of Natural Hi&s;tory, which every day is enriched by his enlightened and generous ta&s;te: he has put it in our power to verify in a great mea&s;ure, on his Sultana Hen, what the an|cients have &s;aid of their Porphyrion. This bird is very gentle and innocent, and at the &s;ame time timorous, fugitive, fond of &s;olitude and retirement, concealing it&s;elf as much as po&s;&s;i|ble when it eats. It cries from fear when one approaches, at fir&s;t with a faint &s;ound, which afterwards grows &s;hriller and louder, and ends with two or three dull and hollow claps: while in a cheerful mood, it vents &s;ofter and calmer accents. It &s;eems to prefer fruits and roots, particularly tho&s;e of the &s;uccories, to every other &s;ort of food, though it can al&s;o live on &s;eeds. If
<PB N="191" REF="214">
offered a fi&s;h, it eagerly &s;eizes it, and devours it greedily. Often it repeatedly &s;oaks its provi|&s;ions in water. How &s;mall &s;oever its mor&s;el may be, it con&s;tantly clenches it with its long toes, bending the hind one over the re&s;t, and holding its foot half rai&s;ed; it then eats by crumbs.</P>
<P>Scarce any bird has more beautiful colours; the blue of its plumage is &s;oft and glo&s;&s;y, em|belli&s;hed with brilliant reflections; its long feet, and the plate from the top of its head to the root of its bill, are of a fine red, and a tuft of white feathers under the tail heightens the lu&s;tre of its charming garb. Except that it is rather &s;maller, the female differs not from the male, which exceeds the partridge, but is infe|rior to a common hen. The Marquis de Ne&s;le brought this pair from Sicily, where, according to the note which he obligingly communicated to us, they are known under the name of <HI>Gallo|fagiani:</HI> they are found on the lake Lentini, above Catana, and are &s;old for a moderate price in that city, as well as in Syracu&s;e and the ad|jacent towns. They appear alive in the public places, and plant them&s;elves be&s;ide the &s;ellers of vegetables and fruits to pick up the refu&s;e: and this beautiful bird, which the Romans lodg|ed in their temples, now experiences the decline of Italy. That fact &s;hows that the Sultana Hens have been naturalized in Sicily from a few pairs of the&s;e Porphyrions introduced from
<PB N="192" REF="215">
Africa; and in all probability this fine &s;pecies has been propagated, in like manner, in &s;ome other countries; for we &s;ee from a pa&s;&s;age of Ge&s;ner, that this naturali&s;t was convinced that the&s;e birds are found in Spain, and even in the &s;outh of France.</P>
<P>This bird is one of tho&s;e which are by nature mo&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to dome&s;tication, and to multiply them would be both agreeable and u&s;eful. The pair kept in the voleries of the Marquis de Ne&s;le, ne&s;tled la&s;t &s;pring (1778); both male and female laboured in con&s;tructing the ne&s;t; they placed it at &s;ome height from the ground, on a projection of the wall, with a heap of &s;ticks and &s;traws: the eggs were &s;ix in number, white, with a rough &s;hell, exactly round, and about the &s;ize of a demi-billiard. The female was not a&s;&s;iduous in covering; and a common hen was &s;ub&s;tituted, but without &s;ucce&s;s. We may &s;urely expect another hatch to be more pro&s;pe|rous if carefully attended by the mother her&s;elf; for this purpo&s;e the&s;e birds ought to enjoy the calm and retreat which they &s;eek, and e&s;pecially in the &s;ea&s;on of love. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] Specific character of the purple Gallinule, <HI>Fulica Porphyrio:</HI> "Its front is red, many bracelets; its body green, below violet."</NOTE></P>

<P>SINCE the primary &s;tock of the Sultana Hen inhabits the &s;outhern regions of our conti|nent, it is not probable that the climates of the north produce the &s;econdary &s;pecies.

Yet in autumn they all leave the &s;mall pools, and re&s;ort to the large ones, where they a&s;&s;emble in a great flock: there they often remain till December; and when the &s;nows, and e&s;pecially the fro&s;ts, drive them from the high and chill tracts, they de|&s;cend into the plains, which enjoy a milder tem|perature; and the want of water, rather than the cold, con&s;trains them to &s;hift their haunts. M. Hebert &s;aw them in a very &s;evere winter on the lake of Nantua, which is late in freezing: he &s;aw them al&s;o in the plains of Brie, though in &s;mall numbers, in the depth of winter.

In fact, the &s;pecies con&s;i&s;ts of two fa|milies, which live in the &s;ame lake without ever cohabiting, and are di&s;tingui&s;hed from each other &s;olely by their bulk, and not by the colour of the frontal plate, as &s;ome pretend; for in both that is u&s;ually white, and becomes red only in the &s;ea&s;on of love.</P>
<P>This thick naked membrane, which covers the fore &s;ide of the head like an e&s;cutcheon, and which made the ancients give the Coot the epithet of <HI>bald,</HI> &s;eems to be a production of the upper layer of the &s;ub&s;tance of the bill, which is &s;oft, and almo&s;t fle&s;hy near the root. The bill is fa&s;hioned into a flat cone at the &s;ides, and is blui&s;h white; when in the &s;ea&s;on of court&s;hip, the frontal plate a&s;&s;umes its vermilion tint.</P>
<P>All the plumage is furni&s;hed with a thick down, covered with delicate clo&s;e feathers; it is of a leaden-black, full and deep on the head and neck, with a white &s;treak on the fold of the wing: no difference indicates the &s;ex. The Coot is as large as a dome&s;tic hen, and its head and body are nearly of the &s;ame form: its toes are half-webbed, fringed fully on both &s;ides with a membrane, &s;calloped into fe&s;toons, who&s;e knots corre&s;pond to the joints of the <HI>phalanges:</HI> the&s;e membranes are, like the feet, of a leaden colour: above the knee a &s;mall portion of the naked leg is circled with red: the thighs are

<P>ALL that we have &s;aid of the common Coot <HI>(morelle)</HI> applies to the Greater Coot <HI>(ma|croule);</HI> their habits and their &s;hapes are the &s;ame, only the latter is rather larger than the former, and the bald &s;pace on the front is al&s;o broader. One of the&s;e birds, taken in March 1779, near Montbard, among the vines, whither it had been driven by a violent wind, afforded me an opportunity, for the &s;pace of a month, during which it was kept alive, of making the following ob&s;ervations. It refu&s;ed, at fir&s;t, all &s;orts of dre&s;&s;ed food, bread, chee&s;e, and fle&s;h, raw or boiled: it rejected al&s;o earth-worms and young frogs, whether dead or alive. It required to be crammed with gobbets of &s;oaked bread. It was extremely fond of a tray full of water, and would repo&s;e whole hours in it. It &s;ought al&s;o to hide it&s;elf; though it was not wild, and &s;uffered it&s;elf to be laid hold of, only pecking, with a few &s;trokes, the hand that was about to &s;eize it, and

the&s;e &s;o feeble, either becau&s;e of the &s;oftne&s;s of the bill, or the weakne&s;s of the mu&s;cles, as hardly to make any impre&s;&s;ion on the &s;kin: it betrayed neither anger nor impatience; it made no endeavour to e&s;cape, and &s;hewed no &s;urprize or fear. But this &s;tupid tranquillity, this total want of vigour and courage, proceeded probably from its bewildered condition, remote from its proper element and its u&s;ual habits. It &s;eemed deaf and mute; any noi&s;e made clo&s;e to its ear never moved it, or drew the lea&s;t in|clination of its head; and though it was often pur&s;ued and teazed, it never vented the &s;malle&s;t cry. We have the water-hen equally mute in captivity.

<P>THE Grebe is well known by tho&s;e beauti|ful &s;ilvery white muffs, which have the &s;oft clo&s;ene&s;s of down, the ela&s;ticity of fea|thers, and the lu&s;tre of &s;ilk. Its undre&s;&s;ed plumage, particularly that of the brea&s;t, is really a fine down, very clo&s;e and firm, and regularly di&s;po&s;ed, who&s;e gli&s;tening filaments lie upon each other, and join, &s;o as to form a gla&s;&s;y, &s;hining &s;urface, equally impenetrable by cold or humidity. This clothing, &s;o well adapted to the rigours of &s;ea&s;on and of climate, was nece&s;|&s;ary to the Grebe, which in the &s;evere&s;t win|ters remains con&s;tantly in the water, like the divers; in&s;omuch that it has often been con|founded with them under the common name <HI>colymbus</HI> <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">From <GAP DESC="FOREIGN">, <HI>to go into the water.</HI></NOTE>. But the Grebes differ e&s;&s;entially from the divers, which have their toes com|pletely
<PB N="214" REF="238">
webbed, and not edged with a &s;calloped membrane, parted at each toe; not to mention other di&s;tinctions, which &s;hall be afterwards &s;tat|ed. Accordingly, accurate naturali&s;ts, appro|priating to the divers the terms <HI>mergus, uria,</HI> and <HI>oethya,</HI> re&s;trict that of <HI>colymbus</HI> to the great and little Grebes.</P>
<P>By its &s;tructure, the Grebe is de&s;tined to in|habit the waters; its legs are placed entirely behind, and almo&s;t &s;unk into its belly, &s;o that only the feet appear, and are like oars; they na|turally throw them&s;elves outwards, and could not &s;upport the body of the bird on the ground, unle&s;s it &s;tood quite erect. In this po&s;ition, the &s;triking with its wings would, in&s;tead of rai&s;ing it into the air, only overturn it; &s;ince the legs could not aid the impul&s;ion. It requires there|fore a great effort to begin its flight on land; and, as if con&s;cious of this imbecility, it is ob&s;erved to avoid the &s;hore; and to prevent its being driven thither, it always &s;wims again&s;t the wind <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Oppian. <HI>Exeutic. lib.</HI> ii.</NOTE>. If unfortunately a wave ca&s;ts it on the brink, it continues &s;truggling with its feet and wings, though for the mo&s;t part in vain, to mount into the air, and return to the water: it may be then caught by the hand, in &s;pite of the violent &s;trokes it gives with its bill in defence. But it is as nimble in the water as it is feeble on land: it &s;wims, dives, da&s;hes through the waves, and runs on the &s;urface with &s;urpri&s;ing rapidity;
<PB N="215" REF="239">
its motions are &s;aid even to be never quicker and bri&s;ker than when under water <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. It pur|&s;ues the fi&s;h to a very great depth <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>, and is of|ten caught in fi&s;hermen's nets. It dives deeper than the &s;coter duck, which is taken only on beds of &s;hell-fi&s;h left bare by the ebb-tide; while the Grebes are taken in the open &s;ea, often at more than twenty feet depth.</P>
<P>The Grebes frequent equally the &s;ea and the fre&s;h waters, though naturali&s;ts have &s;carce &s;poken but of tho&s;e which are &s;een on lakes, pools, and inlets of rivers <NOTE N="&#38;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Idem.</NOTE>. Several &s;pecies oc|cur on the coa&s;ts of Brittany, Picardy, and in the channel <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">The little and cre&s;ted Grebes, according to M. Baillon.</NOTE>.

It is rather larger than the coot; its length from the bill to the rump is a foot five inches, and from the bill to the nails a foot and nine or ten inches: all the upper &s;ide of the body is deep brown but glo&s;&s;y, and all the fore &s;ide is of a very fine &s;ilvery white. Like all the other Grebes, it has a &s;mall head, a &s;traight and point|ed bill, and from the corners a &s;mall naked red &s;kin extends to the eye; its wings are &s;hort and
<PB N="216" REF="240">
&s;omewhat di&s;proportioned to the body. The bird ri&s;es with difficulty, but after it has caught the wind, it flies far <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>. Its voice is loud and rough <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Ge&s;ner and Belon.</NOTE>. Its leg, or rather its tar&s;us, is wi|dened and flattened laterally; the &s;cales with which it is covered form on the hind part a double indenting; the nails are broad and flat: the tail is wanting in all the grebes, but they have on the rump the tubercles, in which the tail-quills are u&s;ually in&s;erted, but the&s;e tuber|cles are &s;maller than in other birds, and only bear a tuft of &s;mall feathers.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds are commonly very fat: not only they feed their young with little fi&s;hes, they eat &s;ea-weed and other plants <NOTE N="&#38;;Dagger;" PLACE="foot">Willughby.</NOTE>, and &s;wallow mud <NOTE N="&sect;" PLACE="foot">Schwenckfeld.</NOTE>. White feathers too are often found in their &s;to|mach; not that they devour birds, they catch the down which plays on the water, mi&s;taking it for a &s;mall fi&s;h. It is mo&s;t probable that the Grebes, like the cormorants, ca&s;t up the re&s;idue of dige&s;tion; at lea&s;t fi&s;h-bones are found rolled into pellets and unaltered at the bottom of the ventricle.</P>
<P>The fi&s;hers of Picardy re&s;ort to the Engli&s;h coa&s;t in &s;earch of the Grebes' ne&s;ts, &s;ince they do not breed on that of France <NOTE N="&par;" PLACE="foot">Ob&s;ervations of M. Baillon.</NOTE>; and they find the&s;e in the holes of rocks, into which the birds

probably fly, &s;ince they cannot climb, and whence the young mu&s;t throw them&s;elves into the &s;ea.

<P>The genus of the&s;e birds con&s;i&s;ts of two fa|milies differing in &s;ize.

<P>THIS Grebe has a black tuft, divided behind as it were into two horns; it has al&s;o a &s;ort of mane, rufous at the root, black at the point, cut round the neck; which gives it a very odd look, and makes it to be regarded as a mon&s;trous &s;pecies.

Hebert ob&s;erved this in a captive Diver, which being held by a long &s;tring, took always that direc|tion: it appeared to have lo&s;t nothing of its na|tural liberty: it was kept on a river, where it lived by catching &s;mall fi&s;h. <NOTE PLACE="foot">[A] The &s;peckled Diver lays its eggs near the verge of mari|time lakes: they are oval, du&s;ky with &s;ome black &s;pots, and as large as tho&s;e of a goo&s;e.</NOTE></P>

Some, however, breed in the Scilly i&s;les on the rocks, which they gain by &s;pringing from the water, having taken advan|tage of a &s;well: for, like the other Divers, they can hardly ri&s;e from the land <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>&startq;I one day found two of the&s;e Divers, which had been ca&s;t a&s;hore by the waves; they were lying on the &s;and, working their feet and wings, and crawling with difficulty: I gathered them like &s;tones, yet they were not wounded; and one of them thrown up, flew, dived, and played on the water before my eyes.&endq;</Q> <HI>Ob|&s;ervation communicated by M.

<P>It appears that the&s;e Divers &s;carcely ever quit the northern &s;eas; though, according to Klein, they vi&s;it from time to time the coa&s;ts of the Baltic, and are well known through the whole of Sweden <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">Fauna Suecica.</NOTE>. Their principal abode is on the &s;hores of Norway, Iceland, and Greenland: the&s;e they frequent the whole &s;ummer, and there breed their young, which they rear with &s;ingular care and &s;olicitude. On this &s;ubject, Ander&s;on gives details which would be intere&s;t|ing, were they all accurate. He &s;ays that they lay only two eggs, and that as &s;oon as a young Lumme is able to quit the ne&s;t, the parents lead it to the water, the one flying always above it to keep off the bird of prey, and the other be|low to receive it in ca&s;e it &s;hould fall; and that if notwith&s;tanding their a&s;&s;i&s;tance, the ne&s;tling fall to the ground, the parents ru&s;h after it, and rather than for&s;ake it, they &s;uffer them&s;elves to be caught by men or eaten by foxes, which ever watch tho&s;e opportunities, and which, in tho&s;e bleak frozen regions, are con&s;trained to turn all their &s;agacity and wiles again&s;t the birds. This
<PB N="245" REF="273">
author adds, that when the Lummes have once reached the &s;ea with their young, they return no more to land. He affirms even that the old ones which have accidentally lo&s;t their family, or are pa&s;t breeding, never revi&s;it the &s;hore, but &s;wim always in flocks of &s;ixty or a hundred. <Q>&startq;If we throw a young one into the &s;ea before a flock of Lummes, they will all gather round it, and &s;trive to attend it; nay they will fight about it till the victor leads it off: but if the mother happen to intervene, the quarrel im|mediately cea&s;es, and the infant is con&s;igned to her care.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>On the approach of winter, the&s;e birds retire, and appear not again until the &s;pring. Ander|&s;on conjectures, that, &s;haping their cour&s;e be|tween the ea&s;t and the we&s;t, they arrive in America: and Edwards in fact admits that this &s;pecies is common both to the northern &s;eas of that continent and of Europe.

The experiments with heated balls are inconclu&s;ive. Bodies have no natural tendency to cool, any more than to heat: they only maintain an equality of temperature with the &s;urrounding matter. In ordinary ca&s;es, cooling is produced by the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive application of different portions of air to the hot &s;urface. A body colder than the atmo&s;phere would in the &s;ame manner be heated. In the exhau&s;ted receiver of an air-pump, the progre&s;s of heating or cooling is much &s;lower; and could a perfect vacuum be obtained, there is every rea&s;on to think that a body would for ever retain the &s;ame temperature. The earth would therefore pre&s;erve perpetually its heat; and even though we &s;hould &s;uppo&s;e it to be environed with a &s;ub$le aether (which is altogether improba|ble) the communication of this heat to other planets or &s;y&s;tems would be extremely &s;low and imperceptible. Nay, if there be any difference, the earth is growing warmer, by the ince&s;&s;ant ab&s;orption of the &s;un's rays: yet &s;o va&s;t is its ma&s;s, that this effect will not much exceed a degree in a thou&s;and years.

There they inhabit, collected in thou&s;ands: the report of a mu&s;ket does not di&s;per&s;e them; they only ri&s;e a few feet, and alight again into their ne&s;ts. Nor need we u&s;e fire-arms, for they may

be felled with &s;ticks, and yet their companions will not be alarmed, or endeavour to e&s;cape from the ma&s;&s;acre. Their fle&s;h, e&s;pecially that of the young ones, is pretty good food.</P>
<P>The&s;e birds do not &s;tray far into the &s;ea, and &s;eldom lo&s;e &s;ight of land. Like the penguins, they are clothed with a very thick plumage, well adapted to guard again&s;t the &s;evere and continual cold of the frozen regions which they inhabit. For&s;ter &s;eems to admit &s;everal &s;pecies or varieties of this bird; but as he does not &s;uf|ficiently di&s;tingui&s;h them, and as the different mode of ne&s;tling on tufts or in the crevices of rocks is in&s;ufficient to di&s;criminate the &s;pecies, we &s;hall de&s;cribe only the common Shag known in our climates.</P>
<P>They are pretty numerous on the coa&s;t of Cornwal and in the Iri&s;h &s;ea, particularly on the I&s;le of Man <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>.

The &s;hape of the kidnies is &s;ingular; they are not parted into three lobes, as in other birds, but jagged like a cock's comb on their convex portion, and di|vided from the re&s;t of the lower belly by a membrane which inve&s;ts them: the <HI>cornea</HI> of the eye is of a bright red, and the cry&s;talline ap|proaches the &s;pherical form, as in fi&s;h: the ba&s;e of the bill is furni&s;hed with a red &s;kin, which al&s;o &s;urrounds the eye: the aperture of the no&s;|trils is &s;o narrow a &s;lit as to have e&s;caped ob|&s;ervers, who have a&s;&s;erted, that the cormorants, both the greater and the le&s;&s;er, want the no&s;|trils: the greate&s;t toe in the&s;e two &s;pecies is the outer, compo&s;ed of five <HI>phalanges,</HI> the next one containing three, the third three, and the la&s;t, which is the &s;horte&s;t, only two: the feet are of a &s;hining black, and armed with pointed nails <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">M.

<P>THIS Sea Swallow is named <HI>Guifette</HI> on the coa&s;t of Picardy. Its plumage, which is white under the body, is agreeably variegated with black behind the head, with brown clouded with ru&s;ty on the back, and with a hand&s;ome gray fringed with whiti&s;h on the wings. It is of a middle &s;ize between the two preceding, but differs in &s;everal particulars with regard to ha|bits and oeconomy. Baillon, who compares it with the great &s;ea-&s;wallow, &s;ays, that it is di&s;|tingui&s;hed by many characters: 1. It does not continually &s;eek its food on the &s;ea; it is not pi&s;|civorous, but rather in&s;ectivorous, feeding as much on flies and other in&s;ects, which it &s;naps in the air, as on tho&s;e which it catches on the water: 2. It is not &s;o clamorous as the great &s;ea-&s;wallow: 3. It does not lay on the naked &s;and, but chu&s;es in the mar&s;hes a tuft of herbs

or mo&s;s in &s;ome in&s;ulated hillock amid&s;t the water or on its brink; it carries thither &s;ome dry &s;talks of herbs, and drops its eggs, which are generally three in number: 4. It covers a&s;&s;iduou&s;ly &s;eventeen days, and all the chicks bur&s;t the &s;hell the &s;ame day.</P>
<P>The young cannot fly till after a month, and yet they retire early with their parents, and of|ten before the greater terns. They are &s;een flying along the Seine and the Loire at the time of their pa&s;&s;age. Their flight re&s;embles that of the greater terns; they are even continually in the air: they fly oftener &s;kimming the &s;ur|face of the water, and ri&s;e very high, and with great rapidity.</P>

When one &s;ur|prized a young Booby that had no guard, he gave it a violent peck on the back to make it di&s;gorge, which it did in&s;tantly: it ca&s;t up one or two fi&s;h about the bulk of one's hand, which the old man-of-war bird &s;wallowed &s;till more ha&s;tily.

<P>The Frigat is not larger than a hen, but its wings extend eight, ten, and even fourteen feet. This prodigious expan&s;ion enables it to perform its di&s;tant excur&s;ions, and tran&s;ports it into the mid&s;t of the ocean, where it is often the only object between the &s;ky and the water that gra|tifies the longing eyes of the mariner <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><Q>&startq;We were accompanied with no bird in our route; a white booby or a Frigat appeared now and then at a great di&s;tance (between 15&deg; and 20&deg; &s;outh latitude).&endq;</Q> <HI>Cook.</HI></NOTE>; but this exce&s;&s;ive length of wings has al&s;o its in|convenience; and, like the booby, the Frigat can hardly ri&s;e after it has alighted, &s;o that when &s;urprized in that &s;ituation it may be felled to the ground <NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot"><Q>&startq;I went one of the&s;e la&s;t days to hunt Frigats on their i&s;let at the extremity of Guadaloupe; we were three or four per&s;ons, and in le&s;s than two hours we took three or four hundred; we &s;ur|prized the grown ones on the branches, or in their ne&s;t, and as they had great difficulty in taking wing, we had time to &s;tun them with the blows of &s;ticks." <HI>Dutertre.&mdash;"</HI>They leave their eggs with diffi|culty, and &s;uffer them&s;elves to be knocked down with &s;ticks: I have often been witne&s;s and actor of this butchery.&endq;</Q> <HI>M. de la Borde.</HI></NOTE>.

<P>Both the Gulls and the Mews have a long cutting bill, flat on the &s;ides, with the point fortified and bent into a hook, and a protuberant corner at the lower mandible.

They do not, like mo&s;t other birds, conceal their head under their wing when they &s;leep; they only turn it behind, re&s;ting the bill between the upper &s;ide of the wing and the back.</P>
<P>When a per&s;on tried to catch the&s;e birds, they bit and pecked with rancour: to ma&s;ter them without &s;uffering injury, it was nece&s;&s;ary to throw an handkerchief over their head. If one pur&s;ued them, they quickened their pace by &s;preading their wings. U&s;ually they walked &s;lowly and ungracefully. Their &s;loth was be|trayed even in their rage; for when the large&s;t pur&s;ued the other, he walked lei&s;urely, without &s;eeming to care whether he &s;hould overtake it; nor did the other &s;how any anxiety to e&s;cape, and when it reckoned it&s;elf to be at a &s;ufficient di&s;tance, it &s;topped; and it repeated this exer|tion as often as it was pre&s;&s;ed, &s;o as to keep al|ways beyond its enemy's reach, as if remotene&s;s was &s;ufficient to de&s;troy the antipathy.&mdash;Must not thus the weak ever retire for &s;afety before the &s;trong? But unfortunately tyranny, in the hands of man, is an engine which extends as far as his thought!</P>
<P>The&s;e birds appeared the whole winter to
<PB N="364" REF="401">
forget the u&s;e of their wings. They di&s;covered no inclination to fly away: they were indeed well fed, and their gluttonous appetite could not torment them. But in the &s;pring they felt new appetites, and &s;howed other de&s;ires; they en|deavoured to ri&s;e into the air, and would have e&s;caped, had not &s;everal inches been clipt from their wings: they could therefore only &s;pring by jerks, or whirl on their feet with their wings expanded. The pa&s;&s;ion of love, which wakens with the &s;ea&s;on, &s;eemed to &s;uppre&s;s the in&s;tinct of antipathy, and de&s;troy their mutual enmity: for they &s;eemed to fondle each other, and though they did not con&s;ort, being of different &s;pecies, they ate, &s;lept, and re&s;ted together. But their plaintive cries and re&s;tle&s;s motions, &s;uffi|ciently declared, that the &s;weete&s;t &s;entiment of nature was provoked, not &s;atisfied.</P>

<P>IT is probable that this Gull, de&s;cribed by Father Feuill&eacute;e, and which is nearly as large as the gray-mantled Gull, is only a &s;hade or va|riety of that &s;pecies, or of &s;ome of the preced|ing, at a certain age.

He adds, as a &s;ingular property, that the inner toe has only two joints, the middle one three, and the outer four, which is therefore the longe&s;t; but this &s;tructure, the mo&s;t favourable for &s;wimming, &s;ince the broade&s;t part of the &s;ole has thus the greate&s;t compa&s;s of motion, occurs in a great number of aquatic birds, and even among the waders.

This bird exceeds not in bulk the white mew; it is only fifteen inches long: the plumage con&s;i&s;ts of a fine white ground on the fore &s;ide of the body, and gray on the mantle, marked with &s;ome &s;treaks of the &s;ame gray that form a kind of half-collar on the upper &s;ide of the neck; it is di&s;tingui&s;hed al&s;o by &s;pots of white and black mixed on the coverts of the wing, with varieties, however, which we &s;hall mention.

The&s;e birds are &s;een on the Thames, near Grave&s;end, according to Albin.</NOTE>; and they &s;eem to frequent the &s;eas of both con|tinents. Cate&s;by found them at the Bahama I&s;lands: Fernandez de&s;cribes them under the Mexican name <HI>pipixcan:</HI> and, like all the other mews, they abound mo&s;t in the northern countries. Martens, who ob&s;erved them in Spitzbergen, and calls them <HI>kirmews,</HI> &s;ays, that they lay on whiti&s;h mo&s;s, in which the eggs can hardly be di&s;tingui&s;hed, being al&s;o dirty white, or greeni&s;h dotted with black; they are as large as tho&s;e of pigeons, but very &s;harp at the end; the yolk is red, and the albugineous liquor is blui&s;h. Martens &s;ays, that he ate of them, and found them very good, ta&s;ting like the eggs of lapwings. The parents dart boldly on the per&s;on who dares to rob their ne&s;t, and with loud cries they endeavour to drive him off by &s;triking with their bills. The fir&s;t &s;yllable of their name <HI>kirmew,</HI> is expre&s;&s;ive of their notes, according to the &s;ame traveller; who remarks, however, that their voice differs in the various regions which they inhabit, the polar tracts, the
<PB N="391" REF="430">
coa&s;ts of Scotland, tho&s;e of Ireland, and the Ger|man Ocean. He a&s;&s;erts that, in general, a dif|ference may be perceived in the cries of animals of the &s;ame &s;pecies, re&s;ulting from the influence of climate; and this diver&s;ity may indeed ob|tain, e&s;pecially in birds, for the tones of animals are the expre&s;&s;ions of their mo&s;t u&s;ual &s;en&s;a|tions; and the feathered race are delicately &s;en&s;i|ble to the variations of the atmo&s;phere, and to the impre&s;&s;ions of temperature.</P>
<P>Martens ob&s;erves likewi&s;e, that the Mews of Spitzbergen have finer and more hairy feathers than tho&s;e of our &s;eas. This difference, too, ari&s;es from the climate. Another, which &s;eems to be derived from the age of the individual, con&s;i&s;ts in the colour of the bill and the feet: in &s;ome the&s;e are red, in others black. But what proves that this difference does not con&s;ti|tute two di&s;tinct &s;pecies is, that the intermediate &s;hade occurs in &s;everal &s;ubjects; &s;ome having the bill red, and the legs only reddi&s;h, and others having the bill red at the tip only, and the re&s;t black. Thus we admit but one &s;pecies of Laugh|ing Mew; the difference which led Bri&s;&s;on to make a &s;ubdivi&s;ion, lying entirely in the colour of the bill and of the legs. In the female, the front and throat are marked with white, whereas the whole head of the male is covered with a black cap: the great quills of the wing are al&s;o partly this colour: the mantle is blui&s;h cine|reous, and the re&s;t of the body white. <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the Black-headed Gull, <HI>Larus Ridi|bundus:</HI> "It is whiti&s;h, its head blacki&s;h, its bill and feet red."&mdash;Specific character of the Laughing Gull, <HI>Larus Atricilla:</HI> <Q>&startq;It is &s;omewhat hoary, its head blacki&s;h, its bill red, its feet black.&endq;</Q></P>

About our Lady|day, or &s;ooner in a forward &s;pring, they come to &s;tay for good, otherwi&s;e not till the beginning of April, when they build their ne&s;ts, which they make not of &s;ticks, but heath and ru&s;hes, making them but &s;hallow, and laying generally but four eggs, three and five more rarely, which are about the bigne&s;s of a &s;mall hen egg. The hafts or i&s;lands are prepared for them between Mi|chaelmas and Chri&s;tmas, by cutting down the reeds and ru&s;hes, and putting them a&s;ide in the nooks and corners of the hafts, and in the valleys, to make them level; for &s;hould they be permitted to rot on the i&s;lands, the pewits would not endure them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;After three weeks &s;itting the young ones are hatched, and about a month after they are almo&s;t ready to fly, which u&s;ually happens on the 3d of June, when the proprietor of the pool orders them to be driven and catched, the gentry coming from all parts to &s;ee the &s;port: the manner is thus&mdash;They pitch a rabbet-net on the bank|&s;ide, in the mo&s;t convenient place over-again&s;t the hafts, the net in the middle being about ten yards from the &s;ide, but clo&s;e at the ends in the manner of a bow; then &s;ix or &s;even men wade into the pool, beyond the pewits, over-again&s;t the net, with long &s;taves, and drive them from the hafts, whence they all &s;wim to the bank|&s;ide, and landing, run like lapwings into the net, where people are &s;tanding ready to take them up, and put them into two pens made within the bow of the net, which are built round, about three yards diameter, and a yard high, or &s;omewhat better, with &s;mall &s;takes driven into the ground in a circle, and interwoven with broom and other raddles.&endq;</Q>&mdash;(This de&s;cription is illu&s;trated by an engraving).</P>

<P>WE &s;u&s;pect that this bird is no other than our &s;potted mew <HI>(kittiwake)</HI> which vi&s;its the inland parts of England during winter. We make this conjecture, becau&s;e its bulk is the &s;ame, and its plumage &s;imilar, only brown where the other is gray: and it is well known that the&s;e birds when young have a darker ca&s;t, not to mention how ea&s;ily the &s;hades may be confounded in a de&s;cription or drawing. If that of the Briti&s;h Zoology had been better, we could have &s;poken with more confidence. How|ever, this Mew lives in winter on earth-worms, and when its &s;tomach is overloaded, it di&s;gorges them half-dige&s;ted; which is the origin of the <HI>&s;tar-&s;hot</HI> or <HI>&s;tar-gelly.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="foot"><P>[A] Specific character of the Winter-Mew, <HI>Larus Hybernus:</HI> <Q>&startq;It is white; its top, the back of its head, and the &s;ides of its neck, &s;potted; its back cinereous; the fir&s;t of its wing-quills black; its tail marked with a black bar near the tip.&endq;</Q>&mdash;There is a pa&s;&s;age in Morton's Hi&s;tory of Northampton&s;hire, which, as it throws light on the oeconomy of the Winter-Mew, and indeed on the nature of birds in general, de&s;erves a place in this work.</P>
<P><Q>"I &s;hall here," &s;ays the intelligent author, &startq;&s;et down my remarks upon that <HI>gelatinous</HI> body called <HI>&s;tar-gelly, &s;tar-&s;hot,</HI> or <HI>&s;tar-fall'n;</HI> &s;o named becau&s;e vulgarly believed to fall from a &s;tar, or to be the recrement of the meteor which is called the falling or &s;hooting &s;tar, or rather the meteor it&s;elf &s;hot down to the earth. It is generally a clear, almo&s;t &s;ky-coloured, tremulous, vi&s;cid, or tenacious gelly; but in water glib and &s;lippery. To the hand it is as cold as we gene|rally &s;ay a frog is; and is apt to &s;trike a chillne&s;s into it. 'Tis found in lumps or ma&s;&s;es of a certain &s;ize. The large&s;t I have &s;een was about the bigne&s;s of a goo&s;e egg. Tho&s;e that are found fre&s;h and new, are generally entire, very little, if at all, broken or di&s;|per&s;ed: &s;ome of the ma&s;&s;es are curled or convoluted &s;omewhat like the <HI>ileum,</HI> or as a garden-&s;nail appears when the &s;hell is broken off from it. In con&s;i&s;tence and colour, it pretty much re&s;embles boiled &s;tarch, or rather a &s;olution of <HI>gum tragacanth.</HI> I &s;et &s;ome of this gelly on the fire in a &s;ilver ve&s;&s;el: it did not di&s;&s;olve, as does cold boiled &s;tarch when it is &s;et again upon the fire; but became thick and vi&s;cous; the more fluid or watery part of it having gone off in vapour. I let it &s;tand till the humidity was all evaporated. To the bottom of the ve&s;&s;el adhered certain &s;kins and ve&s;&s;els, like tho&s;e of animal bodies. The in&s;ide of the porringer upon this operation exhibited a gli&s;tering like that of i&s;ingla&s;s; and there proceeded from it a kind of grea&s;y &s;mell. Another experiment I made of the gelly broken and put into &s;pring-water, which I &s;et to &s;eeth upon the fire, but not much of it di&s;&s;olved. A piece of mu&s;lin being dipt into it &s;o managed as with &s;tarch, was &s;tiffened as with that. The glo&s;s that it gave to the mu&s;lin might be rubbed off. The gelly being put into water, &s;ome of it &s;ub&s;ided; &s;ome did not. In the pieces that floated I ob&s;erved &s;everal bubbles, which I thought were formed by the water intruded into and retained in the pores&endq; of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;It is &s;ometimes found with patches of a dirty yellow in it; &s;ometimes with black &s;pecks re&s;embling little pellets of grumous blood. Breaking one of the lumps, I di&s;covered and took out of it &s;everal pieces of tough &s;kin, and of long tenacious &s;tring-like bo|dies. Macerating another of the&s;e ma&s;&s;es that I might clear the &s;trings, as I called them, from the &s;ofter or more pulpy part of the gelly, I found them branched and di&s;tended through the whole ma&s;s. The &s;maller branches in &s;ize and figure like capillary blood|ve&s;&s;els of a blacki&s;h red. With the&s;e were broad pieces of a very thin film or membrane. The ma&s;s, though a large one of the &s;ort, might be drawn up and &s;u&s;pended by the&s;e &s;trings. The gelly, when it has been kept for &s;ome time, becomes putrid, and has a &s;trong &s;mell, like that of a dead carca&s;e in a putrid &s;tate. Chickens&endq; will eat it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;This &s;tar-&s;hot, as it is called, is very rarely to be met with on the tillage-lands. At Oxendon, and in mo&s;t other places, we find it chiefly in the lower and moi&s;ter ground, particularly on the ledges of &s;od, upon the &s;ides of trenches in meadows, upon and near the banks of brooks or pools, on ant-hills and mould-banks now and then in great plenty. It occurs &s;ometimes in dry, barren, and heathy ground. It does not appear for any number of years &s;uc|ce&s;&s;ively in one and the &s;ame place. At Pisford, in January 1702, was &s;hown me a ma&s;s of &s;tar-gelly lying upon a dead hedge that I am well a&s;&s;ured had its fir&s;t appearance there. The like has been found upon a flat board at the top of a cherry-ladder, in Mr. Courtman's garden at Thorpe. The la&s;t in as compact a ma&s;s as&endq; tho&s;e upon the ground are u&s;ually found in.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;'Tis chiefly &s;een in mi&s;ty mornings, and in wet weather, in au|tumn, in winter, and early in the &s;pring; &s;eldom or never any that&endq; is fre&s;h and new in the time of fro&s;t, or in the &s;ummer months.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;In 1700, there was no &s;tar-gelly to be found about Oxendon, till a wet week in the end of February, when the &s;hepherds brought&endq; me about thirty &s;everal lumps or ma&s;&s;es of it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;Applied to the running heels of hor&s;es, it has been found to be&endq; of u&s;e; as al&s;o for pa&s;ting paper to pa&s;teboard, gla&s;s, and the like.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;As to the origin of this body, it has in many particulars a near analogy with animal &s;ub&s;tances; as the de&s;cription of it plainly &s;hows. And by &s;everal other circum&s;tances that are not men|tioned, it appears to me to be only the di&s;gorging or ca&s;ting of birds of three or four &s;orts; of tho&s;e &s;ort of fowl in particular that at certain &s;ea&s;ons do feed very plentifully upon earth-worms and the like; and e&s;pecially of the <HI>&s;ea-maw,</HI> and the <HI>winter-mew</HI> or <HI>coddy-moddies</HI> birds of the gull kind, which are very ravenous. The <HI>coddy-moddies</HI> come up into this country in great numbers at the time this &s;tar-&s;hot is generally found, viz. in the autumn and the winter months: frequent tho&s;e very places where it u&s;ually occurs, viz. moi&s;t meadows and the banks of brooks, more rarely ploughed lands; and greedily devour carth-worms, which in tho&s;e places, and about that time of the year, are very nume|rous. They generally come up the vallies, where our brooks and rivers run, very early in the morning, even before the &s;hep|herds or any body el&s;e are abroad in the fields; e&s;pecially in foggy mornings and before a &s;torm, in &s;uch &s;ea&s;ons and in &s;uch weather as in a particular manner invite the earth-worms out of their holes and rece&s;&s;es up upon the &s;urface: and the birds return again to &s;eaward. In the month of September, 1708, I &s;aw a <HI>coddy-moddy</HI> &s;hot down to the ground, that on her fall upon the ground, when almo&s;t half-dead, di&s;gorged a heap of half-dige&s;ted&endq; earth-worms, much re&s;embling the gelly called &s;tar-&s;hot.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;In fine, having compared the notes or marks of that di&s;gorge or ca&s;ting with tho&s;e of the gelly, called &s;tar-&s;hot, I found them &s;o much alike, I am &s;atisfied the latter is for the main the &s;ame origin as is the former. Some of the&s;e ma&s;&s;es I take to be di&s;|gorged by herons and bitterns after having fed upon frogs, which they &s;ometimes do. Sir William Craven once &s;hot a bittern by one of Winwick pools, which after great heaving and working of her brea&s;t, at length di&s;charged a quantity of this &s;ort of gelly. The worthy Mr. Thomas Clerke, of Watford, a&s;&s;ures me, that he has &s;een a ma&s;s of &s;tar-gelly, wherein appeared the head and other parts of a frog almo&s;t di&s;&s;olved into a gelly, like to that which encompa&s;&s;ed it. Having kept a parcel of frogs &s;pawn &s;ome time by me, it had a &s;mell very like that of corrupted &s;tar-&s;hot. Others of them, it is not unlikely, are di&s;gorged by crows, when they feed over-abundantly on earth-worms. The carrion crow will likewi&s;e feed upon frogs and toads too, pecking them into pieces, and &s;o devouring them; whereas the herons, &amp;c. &s;wallow them whole. The gelly upon the dead hedge, and on the cherry-ladder, in the in&s;tances above-mentioned, I am apt to&endq; think came from crows or rooks....</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;'Tis u&s;ual with birds, the more ravenous &s;ort e&s;pecially, to ca&s;t up what is unea&s;y and burthen&s;ome to their &s;tomachs. This is well known to tho&s;e who are conver&s;ant and experienced in the bu&s;ine&s;s of ordering and managing of birds, e&s;pecially hawks. We may rea&s;onably &s;uppo&s;e, that all other birds that have a membranous &s;tomach, and voracious appetite, do the &s;ame upon any the like occa&s;ion; the&s;e in particular I have now mention|ed, namely, herons and bitterns, which have a membranous &s;to|mach, as have all the carnivorous birds: and the Winter-Mew, and the carrion crow, who&s;e &s;tomachs are not furni&s;hed with &s;uch thick mu&s;cles, as are tho&s;e of the granivorous birds. The&s;e, the <HI>Winter-Mew</HI> particularly, having glutted and overcharged their &s;tomachs with earth-worms, or the like cold and vi&s;cid food, they ca&s;t it up again not duly di&s;&s;olved; then e&s;pecially when the earth-worms, &amp;c. are a new or more uncommon &s;ort of food to them. We have a parallel in&s;tance in &s;ome &s;orts of fi&s;hes, accord|ing to the curious and judicious Mr. Ray, who takes the <HI>Ballae Marinae,</HI> which are little round lumps (&s;ome of them as big as tennis-balls) of <HI>fel&s;tu$ae</HI> ama&s;&s;ed together, to be ca&s;t out of fi&s;hes &s;tomachs.&endq;</Q></P></NOTE></P>

AFTER this enumeration of the &s;pecies of Gulls and Mews well de&s;cribed and di&s;tinctly known, we &s;hall mention a few others, which might probably be ranged with the preceding, if their indications were more complete.</P>
<P N="1">1. That which Bri&s;&s;on calls <HI>the little gray mew,</HI> &s;aying, that it is <HI>equal in bulk to the great cinereous mew;</HI> and which &s;eems to differ from that &s;pecies, or from that of the gray-mantled bill, becau&s;e it has white mixed with gray on the back.</P>
<P N="2">2. That great Sea-Mew, mentioned by An|der&s;on, which preys on an excellent fi&s;h, called in Iceland <HI>runmagen.</HI> He tells us, that this bird carries it a&s;hore, and eats only the liver; and that the pea&s;ants in&s;truct the children to run up to the Mew as &s;oon as it alights, and &s;natch from it the fi&s;h.</P>
<P N="3">3. The bird killed by Mr. Banks, in the la|titude of 1&deg; 7&prime; north, and longitude 28&deg; 50&prime;, and which he terms the <HI>black-footed gull,</HI> or <HI>larus cre|pidatus.</HI> The excrements were of a bright red,
<PB N="399" REF="438">
approaching that of the liquor contained in the <HI>helix,</HI> which floats on the &s;ea; which renders it probable that the bird feeds on that &s;hell-fi&s;h.</P>
<P N="4">4. The Mew called by the inhabitants of the i&s;land of Lu&ccedil;on <HI>taringting,</HI> and which, from the character of vivacity a&s;cribed to it, and its habit of running &s;wiftly on the &s;hore, may be either the little gray mew or the laughing mew.</P>
<P N="5">5. The Mew of the lake of Mexico, called by the inhabitants <HI>acuicuitzcatl,</HI> and of which Fernandez &s;ays nothing more.</P>
<P N="6">6. La&s;tly, a Gull ob&s;erved by the Vi&s;count de Querho&euml;nt, in the road off the Cape of Good Hope, and which, from the account he oblig|ingly communicated, mu&s;t be a &s;ort of the black-mantle, but its legs, in&s;tead of red, are &s;ea-green.</P>

<P>CONSIDERING its &s;ize and figure, this bird might be ranged with the mews. But if it be of that family, it has lo&s;t all fraternal affection; for it is the avowed and eternal per|&s;ecutor of its kindred, and particularly of the kittiwake. It keeps a &s;teady eye on them, and when it perceives them betake to flight, it pur|&s;ues without intermi&s;&s;ion. The people of the north report that its object is to obtain the excrements from tho&s;e unhappy little mews; and they have, for that rea&s;on, called it <HI>Strund|jager,</HI> to which <HI>Stercorarius</HI> is &s;ynonymous. Mo&s;t probably, however, this bird does not devour the dung, but only the fi&s;h which the kittiwakes drop from their bill or di&s;gorge <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot"><P>Some naturali&s;ts have alledged, that certain &s;pecies of gulls pur&s;ue others for their excrements. I have done all that was in my power to a&s;certain this fact, which I was always aver&s;e to be|lieve. I have frequently repaired to the &s;ea-&s;hore to make ob&s;er|vations, and have di&s;covered what give ri&s;e to the fable. It is this:</P>
<P>This gulls maintain with each other a perpetual conte&s;t about their carnage, at lea&s;t the great and middle &s;pecies: when one comes out of the water with a fi&s;h in its bill, the fir&s;t which per|ceives it &s;hoots down to &s;natch the prey; and if the fortunate plun|derer ha&s;tens not to &s;wallow the capture, it will be pur&s;ued in its turn by others &s;till &s;tronger, which &s;trike it violently with their bill; it cannot avoid them but by e&s;caping, or by repelling its ene|my; and whether that the fi&s;h incumbers its flight, or that it is over|come with fear, or &s;en&s;ible that the fi&s;h is the &s;ole motive of the pur&s;uit, it quickly throws it up; the other, which &s;ees it drop, catches it dextrou&s;ly before it reaches the water, and &s;eldom mi&s;&s;es to receive it.</P>
<P>The fi&s;h appears always white in the air, becau&s;e it reflects the light, and &s;eems, by rea&s;on of the celerity of the flight, to drop be|hind the gull which vomits it. The&s;e two circum&s;tances have de|ceived ob&s;ervers.</P>
<P>I have verified the &s;ame fact in my garden; I cha&s;ed &s;ome large gulls &s;houting after them; they ran and di&s;gorged the fi&s;h which they had ju&s;t &s;wallowed; I threw it to them, and they caught it in the air, with as much alertne&s;s as dogs. <HI>Note communicated by M.

e&s;pecially as it catches fi&s;h it&s;elf, and al&s;o eats whale's blubber; and amid&s;t the abundance of nouri&s;hment with which the &s;ea &s;upplies its in|habitants, it would be very &s;trange if the Labbe was reduced to &s;wallow what all the re&s;t re|ject.</P>
<P>No per&s;on has better de&s;cribed the&s;e birds than Ghi&s;ter, in the Memoirs of the Academy of Stockholm. <Q>"The flight of the Labbe," &s;ays he, &startq;is &s;wift and poi&s;ed, like that of the go&s;hawk. The &s;tronge&s;t wind cannot hinder it from catching in the air the &s;mall fi&s;h thrown to it by the fi&s;hermen. When they
<PB N="402" REF="442">
call <HI>lab, lab,</HI> it immediately repairs to receive the fi&s;h, whether raw or dre&s;&s;ed, or the other food which is offered to it. It al&s;o takes the herrings out of the bu&s;&s;es, and if they are &s;alt|ed, it wa&s;hes them before &s;wallowing. One can hardly approach it or fire upon it, un|le&s;s &s;ome bait be thrown. But the fi&s;hermen are kind to it, as it is an almo&s;t infallible &s;ign of a herring-&s;hoal; and when the Labbe does not appear, their &s;ucce&s;s is &s;mall. This bird is almo&s;t always on the &s;ea; generally two or three appear together, and very &s;el|dom five or &s;ix. When it cannot find pro|vi&s;ion at &s;ea, it comes to the beach and at|tacks the mews, which &s;cream on its appear|ance: but it ru&s;hes on them, and overtaking them, it alights on their back, and obliges them to ca&s;t up the fi&s;h which they had ju&s;t &s;wallowed. This bird, as well as the mews, lays its eggs on the rocks; the male is blacker and rather larger than the female <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Collection Academique, <HI>partie etrangere, tom.</HI> xi. <HI>p.</HI> 51.</NOTE>.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>Though it is the Long-tailed Labbe to which the&s;e ob&s;ervations &s;eem chiefly to apply, we con|ceive that they relate al&s;o to the &s;pecies now under con&s;ideration, who&s;e tail is fa&s;hioned &s;o that the two middle feathers are the longe&s;t, but do not much exceed the others. Its bulk is nearly equal to that of the little mew, and its colour is dun cinereous, waved with gray|i&s;h <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">This colour is lighter below the body; and &s;ometimes, accord|ing to Martens, the belly is white.</NOTE>:
<PB N="403" REF="443">
the wings are very large, and the legs are formed as in the mews, only not quite &s;o &s;trong; the toes are &s;horter. But the bill differs more from that of the&s;e birds, the end of the upper mandible being armed with a nail or hook that appears added; a character in which the bill of the Labbe re&s;embles that of the petrels, though the no&s;trils are not tubular.</P>
<P>The Labbe has, in the carriage of its head, &s;omething of the bird of prey, and its predatory life belies not its appearance.

<P>THE mode of life, the habits, and oeconomy of animals, are not &s;o free as might be &s;up|po&s;ed. Their actions re&s;ult not from inclina|tion and choice, but are the nece&s;&s;ary effects of their peculiar organization and &s;tructure. Nor do they &s;eek ever to infringe or evade the law of their con&s;titution: the eagle never abandons his rocks, or the heron her &s;hores: the one &s;hoots down from the aerial regions, to plunder or murder the lamb, founding his pre&s;criptive right on his &s;trength, his armour, and his habi|tual rapine; the other, &s;tanding in the mire, pa|tiently expects the glimp&s;e of its fugitive prey. The woodpecker never for&s;akes the trees, round which he is appointed to creep. The &s;nipe mu&s;t for ever remain in its mar&s;hes; the lark in its furrows, and the warbler in its groves. All the granivorous birds &s;eek the inhabited countries, and attend on the progre&s;s of cultivation. While

tho&s;e which prefer wild fruits and berries, per|petually fly before us, and cheri&s;h the wilds, and fore&s;ts, and mountains: there, remote from the dwellings of man, they obey the injunctions of nature. She retains the hazel grous under the thick &s;hade of pines; the &s;olitary blackbird un|der his rock; the oriole in the fore&s;ts, which re|&s;ound with its notes; while the bu&s;tard &s;eeks its &s;ub&s;i&s;tence on the dry commons, and the rail in the wet meadows. Such are the eternal, immu|table decrees of nature, as permanent as their forms: the&s;e great po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions &s;he never re&s;igns, and on the&s;e we vainly hope to encroach. And are we not continually reminded of the weakne&s;s of our empire? She obliges us even to receive trouble&s;ome and noxious &s;pecies: the rats make a lodgment in our hou&s;es, the martins in our windows, the &s;parrows in our roofs; and when &s;he conducts the &s;tork to the top of our old ruinous towers, already the habitation of the mournful family of nocturnal birds, does &s;he not ha&s;ten to re&s;ume the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions which we have u&s;urped for a time, but which the &s;ilent lap&s;e of ages will infallibly re&s;tore to her?</P>
<P>Thus the numerous and diver&s;ified &s;pecies of birds, led by in&s;tinct, and confined by their wants to the different di&s;tricts of nature, have apportioned among them&s;elves the air, the earth, and the water. Each holds its place, and en|joys its little domain, and the means of &s;ub&s;i&s;t|ence, which the extent or defect of its faculties
<PB N="414" REF="454">
will augment or abridge. And as all the po&s;&s;i|ble gradations in the &s;cale of exi&s;tence mu&s;t be filled up, &s;ome &s;pecies, confined to a &s;ingle mode of &s;upport, cannot vary the u&s;e of tho&s;e imper|fect in&s;truments which nature has be&s;towed on them. Thus the &s;poonbill &s;eems formed for ga|thering &s;hell-fi&s;h: the &s;mall flexible &s;trap and the reflected arch of the avo&s;et's bill, reduce it to live on fi&s;h-&s;pawn: the oy&s;ter-catcher has an ax-&s;haped bill, calculated for opening the &s;hells: and the cro&s;sbill could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, were it not dextrous in plucking the &s;cales from the fir|cones. La&s;tly, the <HI>Shearbill</HI> could neither eat &s;idewi&s;e, nor gather food, nor peck forwards; its bill con&s;i&s;ting of two pieces extremely unequal, the lower mandible, being long and extended di&s;|proportionately, projects far beyond the upper, into which it falls like a razor into its haft <NOTE N="*" PLACE="foot">Ray.</NOTE>.

<P>ALL the birds which &s;wim, and who&s;e toes are connected by membranes, have the leg &s;hort, the thigh contracted, and often partly concealed under the belly.

According to Aldrovandus, the things of this bird are &s;hort in proportion to the length of its legs: the bill is yellow throughout, but black at the tip; it is &s;hort, and does not open much: the mantle is iron gray, and the belly white: two white feathers with black points cover the tail. This is all that the naturali&s;t informs us; he adds nothing about its mea&s;ures; but, if we judge from his figure, they are nearly the &s;ame with tho&s;e of the plover.</P>

Tho&s;e large &s;emi-palmated birds, which haunt the &s;ides of waters, but neither dive nor &s;wim, are judiciou&s;ly reckoned by Willughby di&s;tinct and independent &s;pecies: for the Flamingo in particular &s;eems to form the gradation between them and the cla&s;s of the great &s;wimmers, which it re&s;embles by its half-webs, and becau&s;e the membrane &s;tretched between the toes re|cedes in the middle by two &s;callops.

Scaliger compares it to that of the heron, and Ge&s;ner to that of the &s;tork; remarking, as well as Wil|lughby, the exce&s;&s;ive length of the &s;lender neck. <Q>&startq;When the Flamingo has attained its full growth,&endq;</Q> &s;ays Cate&s;by, <Q>&startq;it is not heavier than a wild duck, and is yet five feet high.&endq;</Q> The&s;e great differences in &s;ize, noticed by au|thors, have a reference to the age as well as to the varieties which they have al&s;o remarked in the plumage.

Its &s;kull &s;eems to be rai&s;ed and its throat dilated before, to receive the lower man|dible, which is very broad at its origin. The two mandibles form a round and &s;traight canal as far as their middle; after which the upper one bends &s;uddenly, and its convexity changes into a broad &s;urface: the lower mandible reflects proportionally, but always pre&s;erves the &s;hape of a broad gutter; and the upper one, by a &s;mall curvature at its point, applies to the ex|tremity of the lower mandible. The &s;ides of both are be&s;et internally with a &s;mall black in|denting, who&s;e points are turned backwards. Dr. Grew, who has de&s;cribed this bill with great accuracy, remarks al&s;o a filament within, un$$$ the upper mandible, and which divides it in the middle. It is black from its tip to where it bends, and from thence to the root it is white in the dead bird, but, in the living &s;ubject, it &s;eems liable to vary; &s;ince Ge&s;ner a&s;&s;erts, that it is of a bright red, Aldrovandus that it is brown, Willughby that it is bluei&s;h, and Seba that it is yellow. <Q>"To a &s;mall round head," &s;ays Du|tertre, &startq;is joined a large bill four inches long, half red, half black, and bent into the form of a &s;poon.&endq;</Q> The Academicians, who have de|&s;cribed this bird under the name of <HI>B&eacute;charu,</HI>

When they lay or hatch, they &s;tand erect, not on the top but very near it, their feet on the ground and in the water, leaning them&s;elves again&s;t the hillock, and covering the ne&s;t with their tail: their legs are very long, and as they make their ne&s;t on the ground, they could not, without injuring their eggs or their young, have their legs in the ne&s;t, nor &s;it, nor &s;upport their whole body but for this wonderful in&s;tinct which nature has given them. They never lay more than two eggs, and &s;eldom fewer. Their young ones cannot fly till they are almo&s;t full grown; but will run prodigiou&s;ly fa&s;t. <HI>Dampier.</HI></NOTE>.</P>
<P>The ne&s;ts are always placed in the &s;alt|mar&s;hes; they contain only two or at mo&s;t three eggs, which are white, as thick as tho&s;e of a goo&s;e, and &s;omewhat longer.

But whatever be the progre&s;s of this tint in the plumage, the wing fir&s;t acquires the colour, and is always brighter than the other parts.

<P>Their food is in every country nearly the &s;ame. They eat &s;hell-fi&s;h, fi&s;h-&s;pawn, and aquatic in|&s;ects: they &s;eek them in the mud, into which they thru&s;t their bill and part of their head; at

One of the&s;e Flamingos, caught nearly in the &s;ame manner, lived fifteen years in our court-yard; it continued on good terms with the poultry, and even care&s;&s;ed its fellow|lodgers, the turkies and ducks, by &s;cratching their back with its bill. It fed on the &s;ame grain as the other poultry, provided that it was wetted with a little water; it could eat only by turning the bill to lay hold of its food &s;idewi&s;e: it dabbled like the ducks, and knew tho&s;e per&s;ons &s;o well who u&s;ually took care of it, that when hungry it went to them and pulled their clothes with its bill: it often kept it&s;elf mid-legs in water, &s;eldom changing its place, and plunging from time to time its head to the bottom, to catch &s;mall fi&s;hes, which it prefers to grain. Sometimes it ran on the water, &s;triking it alternately with its claws, and &s;upport|ing it&s;elf by the motion of its wings half extended. It was not fond of &s;wimming, but only of puddling with its feet in &s;hallow water. When it fell, it ro&s;e with great difficulty; and accordingly it never re&s;ted on its belly to &s;leep: it only drew one of its legs under it, leaned upon the other, pa&s;&s;ed its neck upon its back, and concealed its head between the end of its wing and its body, always on the &s;ide oppo&s;ite to the leg which was bent.&endq;</Q> <HI>Letter from M.

for though very wild in the &s;tate of liberty, the Flamingo, when once caught, is &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive, and even affectionate. In fact, it has rather a timo|rous than a lofty &s;pirit; and the &s;ame fear which prompts it to fly, &s;ubdues it after it is taken. The Indians have completely tamed them. M. De Peire&s;c &s;aw them very familiar, &s;ince he gives &s;everal particulars of their dome&s;tic life. They eat more in the night, he &s;ays, than in the day, and &s;oak their bread in water. They are &s;en&s;i|ble to cold, and creep &s;o clo&s;e to the fire as to burn their feet; and when one leg is di&s;abled,

they walk on the other, and a&s;&s;i&s;t their motion by u&s;ing their bill like a crutch on the ground. They &s;leep little, and re&s;t only on one leg, the other being drawn under the belly. Yet they are delicate, and difficult to rear in our cli|mates: it appears even, that, though pliant to the habits of captivity, that &s;tate is very un&s;uitable to their nature, &s;ince they cannot &s;upport it long, but drag out a langui&s;hing exi&s;tence; for they never propagate when re|duced to dome&s;tication.</P>
