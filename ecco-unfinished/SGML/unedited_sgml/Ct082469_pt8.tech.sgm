<P>IF we con&s;ider the projects of the famous Cabal,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXVI.</NOTE> it
will be hard to determine, whether the end, which
they proposed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1674.</NOTE> was more blameable and pernicious,
or the means by which they were to effect it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prepo&s;terous &s;chemes of the cabal.</NOTE> more impolitic
and imprudent. Though they might talk only of recovering
of fixing the king's authority; their intention could be
no other than that of making him ab&s;olute; &s;ince it was
not po&s;&s;ible to regain or maintain, in oppo&s;ition to the
<PB N="2" REF="8">
people, any of tho&s;e powers of the crown, aboli&s;hed by late
law or cu&s;tom, without &s;ubduing the people, and render|ing
the royal prerogative intirely uncontroulable. Again&s;t
&s;uch a &s;cheme, they might fore&s;ee, that every party of
the nation would declare them&s;elves, not only the old
parliamentary party, which, though they kept not in a
body, were &s;till very numerous; but even the greate&s;t
Royali&s;ts, who were indeed attached to Monarchy, but
de&s;ired to &s;ee it limited and re&s;trained by law. It had ap|peared,
that the pre&s;ent Parliament, though elected dur|ing
the greate&s;t prevalence of the royal party, were yet
very tenacious of popular privileges, and retained a con|&s;iderable
jealou&s;y of the Crown, even before they had
received any ju&s;t ground of &s;u&s;picion. The guards, there|fore,
together with a &s;mall army, new levied, and undi&s;|ciplined,
and compo&s;ed too of Engli&s;hmen, were almo&s;t
the only dome&s;tic re&s;ources, which the King could de|pend
on in the pro&s;ecution of the&s;e dangerous councils.</P>
<P>THE a&s;&s;i&s;tance of France was, no doubt, e&s;teemed by
the Cabal a con&s;iderable &s;upport in the &s;chemes which
they were forming: but it is not ea&s;ily conceived, that
they could imagine them&s;elves capable of directing and
employing an a&s;&s;ociate of &s;o domineering a character.
They ought ju&s;tly to have &s;u&s;pected, that it would be
Lewis's &s;ole intention, as it evidently was his intere&s;t, to
rai&s;e incurable jealou&s;ies between the King and his peo|ple;
and that he &s;aw how much a &s;teddy uniform govern|ment
in this i&s;land, whether free or ab&s;olute, would
form invincible barriers to his ambition. Should his a&s;|&s;i&s;tance
be demanded; if he &s;ent a &s;mall &s;upply, it would
&s;erve only to enrage the people, and render the breach
altogether irreparable; if he furni&s;hed a great force, &s;uf|ficient
to &s;ubdue the nation, there was little rea&s;on to
tru&s;t his genero&s;ity, with regard to the u&s;e, which he
would make of this advantage.

<P><PB N="3" REF="10">
IN all its other parts, the plans of the Cabal, it mu&s;t
be confe&s;&s;ed, appear equally ab&s;urd and incongruous.
If the war with Holland was attended with great &s;ucce&s;s,
and involved the &s;ubjection of the republic; &s;uch an ac|ce&s;&s;ion
of force mu&s;t fall to Lewis, not to Charles: And
what hopes afterwards of re&s;i&s;ting by the greate&s;t unani|mity
&s;o mighty a monarch? How dangerous, or rather
how ruinous to depend upon his a&s;&s;i&s;tance again&s;t do|me&s;tic
di&s;contents? If the Dutch, by their own vigour,
and the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of allies, were able to defend them|&s;elves,
and could bring the war to an equality; the
French arms would be &s;o employed abroad, that no con|&s;iderable
reinforcement could thence be expected to &s;e|cond
the King's enterprizes in England. And might not
the project of over-awing or &s;ubduing the people be
e&s;teemed, of it&s;elf, &s;ufficiently odious, without the ag|gravation
of &s;acrificing that State, which they regarded
as their be&s;t ally, and with which, on many accounts,
they were de&s;irous of maintaining the greate&s;t concord
and &s;tricte&s;t confederacy?</P>
<P>WHATEVER views likewi&s;e might be entertained of
promoting by the&s;e mea&s;ures the catholic religion; they
could tend only to render all the other &s;chemes abortive,
and make them fall with inevitable ruin upon the pro|jectors.
The catholic religion, indeed, where it is e&s;ta|bli&s;hed,
is more proper than the prote&s;tant for &s;upport|ing
an ab&s;olute Monarchy; but would any man have
thought of it as the means of acquiring arbitrary author|ity
in England, where it was more dete&s;ted than even
&s;lavery it&s;elf?</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be allowed, that the difficulties, and even in|con&s;i&s;tencies,
attending the &s;chemes of the Cabal, are
&s;o numerous and obvious, that one feels at fir&s;t an incli|nation
to deny the reality of tho&s;e &s;chemes, and to &s;up|po&s;e
them entirely the chimeras of calumny and faction.
But the utter impo&s;&s;ibility of accounting by any other
<PB N="3" REF="11">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="4" REF="12">
hypothe&s;is for tho&s;e &s;trange mea&s;ures embraced by the
court, as well as for the numerous, circum&s;tances, which
accompanied them, obliges us to acknowledge (though
there remains no direct evidence of it<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">No treaty to this purpo&s;e with France ever appeared; and indeed, it is probable for the rea&s;ons mentioned above, that no &s;uch treaty was ever for|mally entered into: The King thought it &s;ufficient, that he joined his intere&s;t with that of the French Monarch, and he believed that this circum|&s;tance alone would enable him to depend on that Prince's a&s;&s;i&s;tance in ca&s;e of nece&s;&s;ity. The abbot Primi indeed publi&s;hed at Paris the terms of a treaty to this purpo&s;e: But there are &s;o many difficulties attending his nar|ration, that it can have little weight with us: He &s;poke only by conjecture, or if he was &s;upplied by the French Mini&s;ters with materials, it was &s;o much the intere&s;t of that court to embroil the King with his &s;ubjects, that their account is very much to be &s;u&s;pected. He &s;ays too, that it was expre&s;ly agreed to divide the United Provinces, to give the inland Provinces to Lewis, Zealand to Charles, Holland to the Prince of Orange. But this is very im|probable on many accounts, particularly becau&s;e there is no appearance of &s;uch a &s;cheme in the French propo&s;als Utrecht. We &s;ee plainly by them, that there was no concerted plan betwixt the two Kings, and that they go|verned them&s;elves entirely by events. Father Orleans, who, it is &s;aid, wrote from materials given him by K. James, is the mo&s;t authentic te&s;ti|mony of the arbitrary de&s;igns of the court; and there is no doubt of the truth of his narration in this particular. But his hi&s;tory in other re|&s;pects is &s;o fal&s;e and &s;uperficial, that were it not &s;upported by other arguments, it would in this narration have &s;mall weight with us. But after all, the di&s;cour&s;e of Sir William Temple to the King after mentioned, which that Monarch does not oppo&s;e, is, next to the evidence of facts, the be&s;t proof of the King's intentions.</NOTE>) that a formal plan
was laid for &s;ubverting the con&s;titution, and that the
King and the Mini&s;try were in reality con&s;pirators again&s;t
the people. What is mo&s;t probable in human affairs is
not always true; and a very minute circum&s;tance, over|looked
in our &s;peculations, &s;erves often to explain events,
which may &s;eem the mo&s;t &s;urprizing and unaccountable.
Though the King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed penetration and a &s;ound judg|ment,
his capacity was chiefly fitted for &s;maller matters<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Duke of Buckingham's character of K. Charles II.</NOTE>,
and the ordinary occurrences of life; nor had he appli|cation
enough to carry his view to di&s;tant con&s;equences,
or to dige&s;t and adju&s;t any plan of political operations.
<PB N="5" REF="13">
AS he &s;carce ever thought twice on any one &s;ubject,
every appearance of advantage was apt to &s;educe him;
and when he found his way ob&s;tructed by unlooked-for
difficulties, he readily turned a&s;ide into the fir&s;t path,
where he expected more to gratify the natural indolence
of his di&s;po&s;ition. To this ver&s;atility or pliancy of ge|nius,
he him&s;elf was inclined to tru&s;t; and he thought,
that, after trying an experiment for enlarging his autho|rity,
he could ea&s;ily, if it failed, return into the ordi|nary
channel of government. But the &s;u&s;picions of the
people, though they bur&s;t not forth at once, were by
this attempt rendered altogether incurable; and the more
they reflected on the circum&s;tances, attending it, the
more re&s;entment and jealou&s;y were they apt to entertain.
They ob&s;erved, that the King never had any favourite;
that he was never governed by his mini&s;ters, &s;carce even
by his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es; and that he him&s;elf was the chief &s;pring
of all public councils. Whatever appearance, therefore,
of a change might be pretended, they &s;till &s;u&s;pected,
that the &s;ame project was &s;ecretly in agitation; and they
deemed no precaution too great to &s;ecure them again&s;t
the pernicious con&s;equences of &s;uch councils.</P>
<P>THE King &s;en&s;ible of this jealou&s;y, was inclined
thenceforth not to tru&s;t altogether to his people; and
though obliged to make a &s;eparate peace, he &s;till kept
up connexions with the French monarch. He apologized
for de&s;erting his ally, by repre&s;enting to him all the real
undi&s;&s;embled difficulties, under which he laboured; and
Lewis, with the greate&s;t complai&s;ance and good humour,
admitted the validity of his excu&s;es. The Duke like|wi&s;e,
con&s;cious that his principles and conduct had ren|dered
him &s;till more obnoxious to the people, maintained
on his own account a &s;eparate corre&s;pondence with the
French court, and entered into particular connexions
with Lewis, which the&s;e princes dignified with the name
of friend&s;hip. The Duke had only in view the &s;ecuring
<PB N="6" REF="14">
his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and favouring the Catholics; and it mu&s;t
be acknowledged to his prai&s;e, that, though his &s;chemes
were dangerous to the people, they gave the King no
ju&s;t ground of jealou&s;y. A dutiful &s;ubject, and an af|fectionate
brother, he knew no other rule of conduct
but obedience; and the &s;ame unlimited &s;ubmi&s;&s;on, which
afterwards, when King, he exacted of his people, he
was ever willing, before he a&s;cended the throne, to pay
to his Sovereign.</P>
<P>AS the King was at peace with all the world, and al|mo&s;t
the only Prince in Europe who was placed in that
agreeable &s;ituation, he thought proper to offer his me|diation
to the contending powers, in order to compo&s;e
all their differences. France, willing to negotiate under
&s;o favourable a mediator, very readily accepted Charles's
offer; but, it was apprehended, that, for a like rea&s;on,
the allies would be inclined to refu&s;e it. In order to give
a &s;anction to his new councils, the King invited Tem|ple
from his retreat, and appointed him amba&s;&s;ador to
the St. $word$.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Remon|&s;trances of Sir W. Temple.</NOTE> That wi&s;e mini&s;ter, reflecting on the un|happy
i&s;&s;ue of his former undertakings, and the fatal
turn of councils, which had occa&s;ioned it, re&s;olved, be|fore
he embarked anew, to acquaint him&s;elf, as far as
po&s;&s;ible, with the real intentions of the King, in tho&s;e
popular mea&s;ures, which he &s;eemed again to have adopt|ed.
After blaming the dangerous &s;chemes of the Cabal,
which the King was de&s;irous to excu&s;e, he told his Ma|je&s;ty
very plainly, that he would find it extremely diffi|cult,
if not ab&s;olutely impo&s;&s;ible, to erect in England
the &s;ame &s;y&s;tem of government and religion, which was
e&s;tabli&s;hed in France: That the univer&s;al bent of the
nation was again&s;t both; and it required ages to change
the genius and &s;entiments of a people: That many, who
were at bottom indifferent in matters of religion, would
yet oppo&s;e all alterations on that head; becau&s;e they con|&s;idered,
that nothing but force of arms could &s;ubdue the
<PB N="7" REF="15">
reluctance of the people again&s;t popery; after which,
they knew, there could be no &s;ecurity for civil liberty:
That in France every circum&s;tance had long been ad|ju&s;ted
to that &s;y&s;tem of government, and tended to its
e&s;tabli&s;hment and &s;upport: That the commonalty, be|ing
poor and di&s;pirited, were of no account; the nobi|lity,
engaged by the pro&s;pect or po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of numerous
offices, civil and military, were entirely attached to the
court; the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, retained by like motives, added
the &s;anction of religion to the principles of civil policy:
That in England a great part of the landed property be|longed
to the yeomanry or middling gentry; the King
had few offices to be&s;tow; and could not him&s;elf even &s;ub|&s;i&s;t,
much le&s;s maintain an army, except by the volun|tary
&s;upplies of his Parliament: That if he had an
army on foot, yet, if compo&s;ed of Engli&s;hmen, they
would never be prevailed on to promote ends, which the
people &s;o much feared and hated: That the Roman Ca|tholics
in England were not the hundredth part of the
nation, and in Scotland not the two hundredth; and it
&s;eemed again&s;t all common &s;en&s;e to hope, by one part,
to govern ninety-nine, who were of contrary &s;entiments
and di&s;po&s;itions: And that foreign troops, if few, would
tend only to inflame hatred and di&s;content; and how to
rai&s;e and bring over at once, or to maintain many, it was
very difficult to imagine. To the&s;e rea&s;onings Temple
added the &s;entiments of Gourville, a Frenchman, for
whom, he knew, the King had entertained a great e&s;teem.
&startq;A King of England,&endq; &s;aid Gourville, &startq;who will be
<HI>the man of his people,</HI> is the greate&s;t King in the world:
But if he will be any thing more, he is nothing at
all.&endq; The King heard at fir&s;t this di&s;cour&s;e with
&s;ome impatience; but being a very dextrous di&s;&s;embler,
he &s;eemed moved at la&s;t, and laying his hand on Tem|ple's,
&s;aid with an appearing cordiality, &startq;And I will be
the man of my people.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="8" REF="16">
TEMPLE when he went abroad, &s;oon found, that the
&s;cheme of mediating a peace was likely to prove abortive.
The allies, be&s;ides their jealou&s;y of the King's media|tion,
were extremely bent upon the continuance of the
war. Spain had &s;tipulated with Holland never to come
to an accommodation, till all things in Flanders were re|&s;tored
to the condition, in which they had been left by
the Pyrenean treaty. The Emperor had very high pre|ten&s;ions
in Al&s;ace; and as the greate&s;t part of the em|pire
joined in the alliance, it was hoped, that France, &s;o
much over-matched in force, would &s;oon be obliged to
&s;ubmit to the terms demanded of her. The &s;tates, in|deed,
oppre&s;&s;ed by exorbitant taxes, as well as checked
in their commerce, were de&s;irous of peace, and had few
or no claims of their own to retard it: But they could
not in gratitude, nor even in good policy, abandon allies,
to who&s;e protection they had been &s;o lately indebted for
their &s;afety. The Prince of Orange like wi&s;e, who had
great influence in their councils, was all on fire for mili|tary
fame, and was well plea&s;ed to be at the head of ar|mies,
from which &s;uch mighty &s;ucce&s;&s;es were expected.
Under various pretences, he eluded, during the whole
campaign, the meeting with Temple; and after the
troops were &s;ent into winter-quarters, he told that mini|&s;ter,
in his fir&s;t conference, that till greater impre&s;&s;ion
was made on France, rea&s;onable terms could not be
hoped for; and it was therefore in vain to negotiate.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;s of the campaign had not an&s;wered ex|pectation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1674.</NOTE>
The prince of Orange, with a &s;uperior army,
was oppo&s;ed in Flanders to the prince of Cond&eacute;, and had
hoped to penetrate into France by that quarter, where
the frontier was then very feeble. After long endeavour|ing,
though in vain, to bring Cond&eacute; to a battle, he
ra&s;hly expo&s;ed, at Seneffe, a wing of his army; and

the advantage. But this imprudence of the prince of
Orange was amply compen&s;ated by his behaviour in that
ob&s;tinate and bloody action which en&s;ued. He rallied his
di&s;mayed troops; he led them to the charge; he pu&s;hed
the veteran and martial troops of France; and he obliged
the prince of Cond&eacute;, notwith&s;tanding his age and cha|racter,
to exert greater efforts, and to ri&s;que his per&s;on
more, than in any action, where, even during the heat
of youth, he had ever commanded. After &s;un-&s;et, the
action was continued by the light of the moon; and it
was darkne&s;s at la&s;t, not the wearine&s;s of the combatants,
which put an end to the conte&s;t, and left the victory un|decided.
&startq; The prince of Orange,&endq; &s;aid Cond&eacute;, with
great candour and genero&s;ity, &startq; has acted in every thing
like an old captain, except venturing his life too like
a young &s;oldier.&endq; Oudenarde was afterwards inve&s;ted
by the prince of Orange; but he was obliged by the
Imperial and Spani&s;h generals to rai&s;e the &s;iege on the
approach of the enemy. He afterwards be&s;ieged and
took Grave; and at the beginning of winter, the armies
broke up, with great discontents and complaints on all
&s;ides.</P>
<P>THE allies were not more &s;ucce&s;sful in other places.
Lewis in a few weeks reconquered Franchecomt&eacute;. In
Al&s;ace, Turenne di&s;played again&s;t a much &s;uperior ene|my,
all that military &s;kill, which had long rendered him
the mo&s;t renowned captain of his age and nation. By a
&s;udden and forced march, he attacked and beat at Sintz|heim
the duke of Lorrain and Caprara, general of the
Imperiali&s;ts. Seventy thou&s;and Germans pour into Al|&s;ace,
and take up their quarters in that province. Tu|renne,
who had retired into Lorrain, returns unexpect|edly
upon them. He attacks and defeats a body of the
enemy at Mulhau&s;en. He chaces from Colmar the elec|tor
of Brandenburgh, who commanded the German
troops. He gains a new advantage at Turkheim. And
<PB N="10" REF="18">
having di&s;lodged all the allies, he obliges them to repa&s;s
the Rhine; full of &s;hame for their multiplied defeats,
and &s;till more,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1647.</NOTE> of anger and complaints again&s;t each
other.</P>
<P>IN England, all the&s;e events were con&s;idered by the
people with great anxiety and concern; though the King
and his mini&s;ters affected great indifference with regard
to them. Con&s;iderable alterations were about this time
made in the Engli&s;h mini&s;try. Buckingham was di&s;|graced,
who had long, by his wit and entertaining hu|mour,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the King's favour. The chief mini&s;ters
were Arlington, now lord chamberlain, and Danby the
trea&s;urer. Great hatred and jealou&s;y took place between
the&s;e mini&s;ters; and the King's affairs were &s;omewhat
di&s;turbed by their quarrels. But Danby gained ground
every day with the King, and Arlington declined in the
&s;ame proportion. Danby was a frugal mini&s;ter; and by
his application and indu&s;try, he brought the revenue into
tolerable order. He endeavoured &s;o to conduct him&s;elf
as to give offence to no party; and the con&s;equence was,
that he was able entirely to pl$a&s;e none. He was al|ways
a declared enemy to the French alliance; but never
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed authority enough to overcome the prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions,
which the King and the Duke retained towards it. It
mu&s;t be a&s;cribed to the prevalence of that intere&s;t, that
the Parliament was a&s;&s;embled &s;o late this year; le&s;t they
&s;hould attempt to engage the King in mea&s;ures again&s;t
France,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1675.</NOTE> during the en&s;uing campaign.<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of April.</NOTE> They met not
till the approach of &s;ummer.</P>
<P>EVERY &s;tep taken by the Commons di&s;covered that ill
humour and jealou&s;y,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> to which the late open mea&s;ures
of the King, and his pre&s;ent &s;ecret attachments gave
&s;uch ju&s;t foundation. They drew up a new bill again&s;t po|pery,
and re&s;olved to in&s;ert in it many &s;evere clau&s;es for
the detection and pro&s;ecution of prie&s;ts: They pre&s;ented
<PB N="11" REF="19">
addre&s;&s;es a &s;econd time again&s;t Lauderdale; and when the
King's an&s;wer was not &s;atisfactory, they &s;eemed &s;till de|termined
to per&s;evere in their applications: An accu&s;a|tion
was moved again&s;t Danby; but upon examining the
&s;everal articles, it was not found to contain any ju&s;t rea|&s;ons
of a pro&s;ecution; and was therefore dropped: They
applied to the King for recalling his troops from the
French &s;ervice; and as he only promi&s;ed, that they
&s;hould not be recruited, they appeared to be much di&s;&s;a|tisfied
with his an&s;wer: A bill was brought in, making
it trea&s;on to levy money without authority of parliament:
Another vacating the &s;eats of &s;uch members as accepted
of offices: Another to &s;ecure the personal liberty of the
&s;ubject, and to prevent &s;ending any one pri&s;oner be|yond
&s;ea.</P>
<P>THAT the court party might not be idle, during the&s;e
attacks, a bill for a new te&s;t was introduced into the
Hou&s;e of Peers by the earl of Linde&s;ey. All members
of either hou&s;e, and all who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any office, were
by this bill required to &s;wear,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Pa&s;&s;ive obe|dience.</NOTE> that it was not lawful,
upon any pretence what&s;oever, to take arms again&s;t the
King; that they abhorred the traiterous po&s;ition of tak|ing
arms by his authority again&s;t his per&s;on, or again&s;t
tho&s;e commi&s;&s;ioned by him; and that they will not at
any time endeavour the alteration of the prote&s;tant reli|gion,
or of the e&s;tabli&s;hed government either in church
or &s;tate.</P>
<P>GREAT oppo&s;ition was made to this bill; as might be
expected from the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the public. Dur|ing
&s;eventeen days, the debates were carried on with
much zeal; and all the rea&s;on and learning of both par|ties
were di&s;played on this memorable occa&s;ion. The
que&s;tion, indeed, with regard to re&s;i&s;tance, was a point,
which entered into the controver&s;ies of the old parties,
cavalier and roundhead; as it made an e&s;&s;ential part of
the pre&s;ent di&s;putes between court and country. Few
<PB N="12" REF="20">
neuters were found in the nation: But among &s;uch as
could maintain a calm indifference, there prevailed &s;enti|ments
very wide of tho&s;e adopted by either party. Such
per&s;ons thought, that all public declarations of the le|gi&s;lature,
either for or again&s;t re&s;i&s;tance, were equally
impolitic, and could &s;erve to no other purpo&s;e, than to
&s;ignalize in their turn the triumph of one faction over
another: That the &s;implicity retained in the antient laws
of England, as well as in the laws of every other na|tion,
ought &s;till to be pre&s;erved, and was be&s;t calculated
to prevent the extremes on either &s;ide: That the ab&s;o|lute
exclu&s;ion of re&s;i&s;tance, in all po&s;&s;ible ca&s;es, was
founded on <HI>fal&s;e</HI> principles; its expre&s;s admi&s;&s;ion might
be attended with <HI>dangerous</HI> con&s;equences; and there was
no nece&s;&s;ity of expo&s;ing the public to either inconve|nience:
That if a choice mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily be made in
the ca&s;e, the preference of utility to truth in public in|&s;titutions
was apparent; nor could the &s;uppo&s;ition of re|&s;i&s;tance,
beforehand and in general terms, be &s;afely ad|mitted
in any government: That even in mixt monar|chies,
where that &s;uppo&s;ition &s;eemed mo&s;t requi&s;ite, it
was yet entirely &s;uperfluous; &s;ince no man, on the ap|proach
of extraordinary nece&s;&s;ity, could be at a lo&s;s,
though not directed by legal declarations, to find the
proper remedy: That even tho&s;e who might, at a
di&s;tance and in &s;chola&s;tic rea&s;oning, exclude all re|&s;i&s;tance,
would yet hearken to the voice of nature; when
evident ruin, both to them&s;elves and to the public, mu&s;t
attend a &s;trict adherence to their pretended principles:
That the que&s;tion, as it ought thus to be entirely ex|cluded
from all determinations of the legi&s;lature, was,
even among private rea&s;oners, little better than a di&s;pute
of words: That the one party could not pretend, that
re&s;i&s;tance ought ever to become a familiar practice; the
other would &s;urely have recour&s;e to it in great extremi|ties:
And thus the difference could only turn on the de|grees
<PB N="13" REF="21">
of danger or oppre&s;&s;ion, which could warrant this
irregular remedy; a difference, which, in a general que&s;|tion,
it was impo&s;&s;ible, by any language, preci&s;ely to fix
or determine.</P>
<P>THERE were many other ab&s;urdities in this te&s;t, par|ticularly
that of &s;wearing not to alter the government
either in church or &s;tate; &s;ince all human in&s;titutions are
liable to abu&s;e, and require continual amendments, which
are, in reality, &s;o many alterations. It is not indeed
po&s;&s;ible to make a law, which does not innovate, more
or le&s;s, in the government. The&s;e difficulties produced
&s;uch ob&s;tructions to the bill, that it was carried only by
two voices in the Hou&s;e of Peers. All the popi&s;h Lords,
headed by the earl of Bri&s;tol, voted again&s;t it. It was
&s;ent down to the Hou&s;e at Commons, where it was
likely to meet with a &s;crutiny &s;till more &s;evere.</P>
<P>BUT a quarrel, which en&s;ued between the two Hou&s;es,
prevented the pa&s;&s;ing all the bills projected during the pre|&s;ent
&s;e&s;&s;ion. One Dr. Shirley, being ca&s;t in a law-&s;uit
before the Chancery again&s;t Sir John Fag, a member of
the Hou&s;e of Commons, preferred a petition of appeal
before the Hou&s;e of Peers. The Lords received it, and
&s;ummoned Fag to appear before them. He complained
to the lower Hou&s;e, who e&s;pou&s;ed his cau&s;e. They not
only maintained, that no member of their hou&s;e could
be &s;ummoned before the Peers; and for this claim they
could plead precedent: They al&s;o a&s;&s;erted, that the
upper Hou&s;e could receive no appeals from any court of
equity; a preten&s;ion, which extremely retrenched the
juri&s;diction of the Peers, and which was contrary to the
practice that had prevailed during this whole century.
The Commons &s;end Shirley to pri&s;on: the Lords a&s;&s;ert
their powers. Conferences are tried; but no accommo|dation
en&s;ues. Four lawyers are &s;ent to the Tower by
the Commons, for tran&s;gre&s;&s;ing the order of the Hou&s;e,
and pleading in this cau&s;e before the Peers. The Peers
<PB N="14" REF="22">
denominate this arbitrary commitment a breach of the
great charter, and order the lieutenant of the Tower to
relea&s;e the pri&s;oners: He refu&s;es obedience: They ap|ply
to the King, and de&s;ire him to puni&s;h the lieutenant
for his contempt. The King &s;ummons both Hou&s;es;
exhorts them to unanimity; and informs them, that the
pre&s;ent quarrel had ari&s;en from the contrivance of his and
their enemies, who propo&s;ed by that means to force a
di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament. His advice has no effect:
The Commons continue as violent as ever; and the
King, finding that no bu&s;ine&s;s could be fini&s;hed, at la&s;t
prorogued the Parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of June.</NOTE></P>
<P>WHEN the Parliament were again a&s;&s;embled,<NOTE PLACE="marg">13th of Oc|tober.</NOTE> there ap|peared
not in any re&s;pect a change of the di&s;po&s;itions of<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parliament.</NOTE>
either hou&s;e. The King de&s;ired &s;upplies, as well for the
building of &s;hips as for taking off anticipations, which
lay upon his revenue. He even confe&s;&s;ed, that he had
not been altogether &s;o frugal as he might have been, and
as he re&s;olved to be for the future: Though he a&s;&s;erted,
that to his great &s;atisfaction he had found his expences by
no means &s;o exorbitant as &s;ome had repre&s;ented them. The
Commons took into con&s;ideration the &s;ubject of &s;upply.
They voted 300,000 pounds for the building of &s;hips;
but they appropriated the &s;um by very &s;trict clau&s;es. They
pa&s;&s;ed a re&s;olution not to grant any &s;upply for taking off
the anticipations of the revenue<NOTE N="c" PLACE="foot">Several hi&s;torians have affirmed, that the Commons found, this &s;e&s;&s;ion, upon enquiry, that the King's revenue was 1,600,000 pounds a year, and that the nece&s;&s;ary expence was but 700,000 pounds; and have appealed to the Journals for a proof. But there is not the lea&s;t appearance of this in the Journals; and the fact is impo&s;&s;ible.</NOTE>. This vote was
carried in a very full hou&s;e, by a majority of four only:
So nearly were the parties ballanced. The quarrel was
revived, to which Dr. Shirley's cau&s;e had given occa&s;ion.
The proceedings of the Commons di&s;covered equal vio|lence
as during la&s;t &s;e&s;&s;ion. A motion was made in the
Hou&s;e of Peers, but rejected, for addre&s;&s;ing the King to
<PB N="15" REF="23">
di&s;&s;olve the pre&s;ent Parliament. The King contented him|&s;elf
with proroguing them to a very long term. Whether
the&s;e quarrels between the Hou&s;es aro&s;e from contrivance
or accident was never certainly known.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of No|vember.</NOTE> Each party
might, according to their different views, e&s;teem them|&s;elves
either gainers or lo&s;ers by them. The Court
might de&s;ire to ob&s;truct all attacks from the Commons,
by giving them other employment. The country party
might de&s;ire the di&s;&s;olution of a Parliament, which, not|with&s;tanding
all di&s;gu&s;ts, &s;till contained too many roya|li&s;ts,
ever to &s;erve all the purposes of the malecontents.</P>
<P>SOON after the prorogation, there pa&s;&s;ed a tran&s;action,
which in it&s;elf is trivial, but tends &s;trongly to mark the
genius of the Engli&s;h government, and of Charles's ad|mini&s;tration
during this period. The liberty of the
con&s;titution, and the variety as well as violence of the
parties, had begot a propen&s;ity for political conver&s;ation;
and as the coffee-hou&s;es in particular were the &s;cenes,
where the conduct of the King and the mini&s;try was can|va&s;&s;ed
with great freedom, a proclamation was i&s;&s;ued to
&s;uppre&s;s the&s;e places of rendezvous. Such an act of
power, during former reigns, would have been ground|ed
entirely on the prerogative; and before the acce&s;&s;ion
of the hou&s;e of Stuart, no &s;cruple would have been en|tertained
with regard to that exerci&s;e of authority. But
Charles, finding doubts to ari&s;e upon his proclamation,
had recour&s;e to the judges, who &s;upplied him with a chi|cane
of law, and that too a very frivolous one, by
which he might ju&s;tify his proceedings. The act, which
&s;ettled the exci&s;e; gave the King a power to refu&s;e li|cences
for retailing liquors to &s;uch as could not find &s;e|curity
for payment of the duties. But coffee was not a
liquor liable to exci&s;e and even this power of refu&s;ing
licences was very, limited, and could not rea&s;onably be
extended beyond the intention of the acr. The King,
therefore, ob&s;erving the people to be much di&s;&s;atisfied,
<PB N="16" REF="24">
yielded to a petition of the coffee-men, who promi&s;ed
for the future to re&s;train all &s;editious di&s;cour&s;e in their
hou&s;es; and the proclamation was recalled.</P>
<P>THIS campaign proved more fortunate to the confede|rates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1675.</NOTE>
than any other during this whole war. The
French took the field in Flanders with a very numerous
army; and the King him&s;elf-&s;erved as a volunteer under
the prince of Cond&eacute;. But notwith&s;tanding his mighty
preparations, he could gain no advantages but the taking
of Huy and Limbourg, places of no great con&s;equence.
The prince of Orange with a con&s;iderable army oppo&s;ed
him in all his motions; and neither party was willing,
without a vi&s;ible advantage, to hazard a general battle,
which might be attended either with the entire lo&s;s of
Flanders on the one hand, or the inva&s;ion of France on the
other. Lewis tired of &s;o unactive a campaign, returned
to Ver&s;ailles; and the whole &s;ummer pa&s;&s;ed in Flanders
without any memorable event.</P>
<P>TURENNE commanded on the upper Rhine, in oppo|&s;ition
to his great rival, Montecuculi, general of the
Imperiali&s;ts. The object of the latter was to pa&s;s the
Rhine, to penetrate into Al&s;ace, Lorraine, or Burgundy,
and to fix his quarters in the&s;e provinces: The aim of
the former was to guard the French frontiers, and to
di&s;appoint all the &s;chemes of his enemy. The mo&s;t
con&s;ummate &s;kill was di&s;played on both &s;ides; and if
any &s;uperiority appeared in Turenne's conduct, it was
a&s;cribed chiefly to his greater vigour of body, by which
he was enabled to in&s;pect all the po&s;ts in per&s;on, and
could on the &s;pot take the ju&s;te&s;t mea&s;ures for the execu|tion
of his de&s;igns. By po&s;ting him&s;elf on the German
&s;ide of the Rhine, he not only kept Montecuculi from
pa&s;&s;ing that river: He had al&s;o laid his plan in &s;o ma&s;|terly
a manner, that in a few days he mu&s;t have obliged
the Germans to decamp, and have gained a con&s;idera|ble
advantage over them; when a period was put to his
<PB N="16" REF="25">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="17" REF="26">
illu&s;trious life, by a random &s;hot, which &s;truck him on
the brea&s;t, as he was taking a view of the enemy. The
news excited &s;orrow in King, court, and people, equalled
by nothing which we meet with in hi&s;tory, but the la|mentations
of the Roman people for the death of Ger|manicus.
The con&s;ternation of the army was inexpre&s;|&s;ible.
The French troops, who, a moment before,
were a&s;&s;ured of victory, now con&s;idered them&s;elves as
totally vanqui&s;hed; and the Germans, who would have
been glad to compound for a &s;afe retreat, expected no
le&s;s than the total de&s;truction of the enemy. But de
Lorges, nephew to Turenne, &s;ucceeded him in the com|mand,
and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a great &s;hare of the genius and ca|pacity
of his predece&s;&s;or. By his &s;kilful operations, the
French were enabled to repa&s;s the Rhine; without con|&s;iderable
lo&s;s; and this retreat was e&s;teemed equally
glorious with the great&s;t victory. The de&s;perate valour
of the Engli&s;h troops, who were placed in the rear,
contributed greatly to &s;ave the French army. They had
been &s;eized with equal pa&s;&s;ion as the native troops of
France, for their brave general, and fought with ardour
to revenge his death on the Germans. The duke of
Marlborough, then captain Churchill, here learned the
rudiments of that art, which he afterwards practi&s;ed with
&s;uch fatal &s;ucce&s;s again&s;t France.</P>
<P>THE prince of Cond&eacute; left the army in Flanders under
the command of Luxembourg; and carrying with him
a con&s;iderable reinforcement, &s;ucceeded to Turenne's
command. He defended Al&s;ace from the Germans, who
had pa&s;&s;ed the Rhine, and invaded that province. He
obliged them fir&s;t to rai&s;e the &s;iege of Hagenau, then
that of Saberne. He eluded all their attempts to bring
him to a battle. And having dextrou&s;ly kept them from
e&s;tabli&s;hing them&s;elves in Al&s;ace, he forced them, not|with&s;tanding
their &s;uperiority of number, to repa&s;s the
<PB N="17" REF="27">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="18" REF="28">
Rhine, and take up their winter quarters in their own
country.</P>
<P>AFTER the death of Turenne, a detachment of the
German army was &s;ent to the &s;iege of Treves: An en|terprize,
in which the Imperiali&s;ts, the Spaniards, the
Palatine, the duke of Lorraine, and many other princes
pa&s;&s;ionately concurred. The project was well concerted,
and executed with vigour. Mare&s;chal Crequi, on the
other hand, collected an army, and advanced with a
view of forcing the Germans to rai&s;e the &s;iege. They left
a detachment to guard their lines, and under the command
of the dukes of Zell and O&s;nabrugh, marched in que&s;t of
the enemy. At Con&s;arbric, they fell unexpectedly, and
with &s;uperior numbers,, on Crequi, and put him to rout.
He e&s;caped with four attendants only; and throwing
him&s;elf into Treves, re&s;olved by a vigorous defence to
make amends for his former error or misfortune. The
garri&s;on was brave, but not abandoned to that total de|&s;pair,
by which their governor was actuated. They
mutinied again&s;t his ob&s;tinacy; capitulated for them|&s;elves;
and becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to &s;ign the capitulation,
they delivered him a pri&s;oner into the hands of the
enemy.</P>
<P>'TIS remarkable, that this rout of Crequi is almo&s;t
the only battle, which the French lo&s;t at land, from Ro|croi
to Blenheim, during the cour&s;e of above &s;ixty years;
and the&s;e too, full of bloody wars again&s;t potent and
martial enemies: Their victories equal almo&s;t the num|ber
of years during that period. Such was the vigour
and good conduct of that Monarchy! And &s;uch too
were the re&s;ources and refined policy of the European
nations, by which they were enabled to repair their lo&s;&s;es,
and &s;till to confine that mighty power nearly within its
antient limits! A fifth part of the&s;e victories would have
&s;ufficed in another period to have given to France the
empire of Europe.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="29">
THE Swedes had been engaged, by the payment of
large &s;ub&s;idies, to take part with Lewis, and invade the
territories of the elector of Brandenburgh in Pomera|nia.
That elector, joined by &s;ome Imperiali&s;ts from Si|le&s;ia,
fell upon them with great bravery and &s;ucce&s;s.
He &s;oon beat them out of his part of that country, and
pur&s;ued them into their own. He had an interview with
the King of Denmark, who was now entered into the
intere&s;ts of the confederates, and re&s;olved to declare war
again&s;t Sweden. The&s;e princes concerted mea&s;ures for
pu&s;hing the victory.</P>
<P>TO all the&s;e misfortunes again&s;t foreign enemies were
united &s;ome dome&s;tic in&s;urrections of the common peo|ple
in Guienne and Brittany. Though &s;oon &s;uppre&s;&s;ed,
they divided the force and attention of Lewis. The
only advantage, gained by the French, was at &s;ea. Me&s;|&s;ina
in Sicily had revolted; and a fleet under the duke
de Vivonne was di&s;patched to &s;upport the rebels. The
Dutch had &s;ent a &s;quadron to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Spaniards. A
battle en&s;ued, where de Ruyter was killed. This event
alone was thought equivalent to a victory.</P>
<P>THE French, who, twelve years before, had &s;carce a
&s;hip of war in any of their harbours, had rai&s;ed them|&s;elves,
by means of per&s;everance and policy, to be, in
their pre&s;ent force, though not in their resources, the
fir&s;t maritime power in Europe. The Dutch, while
in alliance with them again&s;t England, had &s;upplied
them with &s;everal ve&s;&s;els, and had taught them the ru|dimerits
of the difficult art of &s;hip building. The Eng|lish
next, when in alliance with them again&s;t Holland,
in&s;tructed them in the method of fighting their &s;hips,
and of pre&s;erving order in naval engagements. Lewis
availed him&s;elf of every opportunity to aggrandize his
people, while Charles, &s;unk in indolence and plea&s;ure,
neglected all the noble arts of government; or if, at
time he rou&s;ed him&s;elf from his lethargy, that in|du&s;try,
<PB N="20" REF="30">
by rea&s;on of the unhappy projects which he em|braced,
was often more pernicious to the public than his
inactivity it&s;elf. He was as anxious to promote the na|val
power of France, as if the &s;afety of his crown had
depended on it; and many of the plans executed in
that kingdom, were fir&s;t, 'tis &s;aid<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Welwood, Burnet, Coke.</NOTE>, dige&s;ted and cor|rected
by him.</P>
<P>THE &s;ucce&s;&s;es of the allies had been con&s;iderable the
la&s;t campaign;<NOTE PLACE="marg">1676.</NOTE> but the Spaniards and Imperiali&s;ts well
knew, that France was not yet &s;ufficiently broke, nor
willing to &s;ubmit to the terms which they re&s;olved to
impo&s;e upon her. Though they could not refu&s;e the
King's mediation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Congre&s;s of Nimeguen.</NOTE> and Nimeguen, after many difficul|ties,
was at la&s;t fixed on as the place of congre&s;s; yet
under one pretence or other, they &s;till delayed &s;ending
their amba&s;&s;adors, and no progre&s;s was made in the ne|gotiation.
Lord Berkeley, Sir William Temple, and
Sir Lionel Jenkins, were the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters at Nime|guen.
The Dutch, who were impatient for peace, &s;oon
appeared: Lewis, who hoped to divide the allies, and
who knew, that he him&s;elf could neither be &s;educed nor
forced into a di&s;advantageous peace, &s;ent amba&s;&s;adors:
The Swedes, who hoped to recover by treaty, what they
had lo&s;t by arms, were al&s;o forward to negotiate. But
as the&s;e powers could not proceed of them&s;elves to &s;ettle
terms, the congre&s;s hitherto &s;erved merely as an amu&s;ement
to the public.</P>
<P>IT was by the events of the campaign,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1676.</NOTE> not the confe|rences
of the negotiators, that the articles of peace were
to be determined. The Spani&s;h towns, ill fortified and
wor&s;e defended, made but a feeble re&s;i&s;tance to Lewis,
who, by laying up magazines during the winter, was
able to take the field early in the &s;pring, before the fo|rage
could be found in the open country. In the month
of April he laid &s;iege to Cond&eacute;, and took it by &s;torm it
<PB N="21" REF="31">
four days. Having &s;ent the duke of Orleans to be&s;iege
Bouchaine, a &s;mall but important fortre&s;s, he po&s;ted
him&s;elf &s;o advantageou&s;ly with his main army, as to
hinder the confederates from relieving it, or fighting
without di&s;advantage. The Prince, in &s;pite of all the
difficulties of the &s;ea&s;on, and the want of provi&s;ions,
came in &s;ight of the French army; but his indu&s;try
&s;erved to no other purpo&s;e than to render him a &s;pecta|tor
of the &s;urrender of Bouchaine. Both armies &s;tood in
awe of each other, and were unwilling to hazard an ac|tion,
which might be attended with the mo&s;t important
con&s;equences. Lewis, though he wanted not per&s;onal
courage, was very little enterprizing in the field; and
being re&s;olved this campaign to re&s;t contented with the
advantages which he had &s;o early acquired, he thought
proper to entru&s;t his army to Mare&s;chal Schomberg, and
retired him&s;elf to Ver&s;ailles. After his departure,
the Prince of Orange laid &s;iege to Mae&s;tricht; but
meeting with an ob&s;tinate re&s;i&s;tance, he was obliged, on
the approach of Schomberg, who in the mean time had
taken Aire, to rai&s;e the &s;iege. He was incapable of
yielding to adver&s;ity, or bending under misfortunes: But
he began to fore&s;ee, that by the negligence and errors of
his allies, the war in Flanders mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily have a
very unfortunate i&s;&s;ue.</P>
<P>ON the upper Rhine, Philip&s;bourg was taken by the
Imperiali&s;ts. In Pomerania, the Swedes were &s;o un&s;uc|ce&s;sful
again&s;t the Danes and Brandenburgers, that they
&s;eemed to be lo&s;ing apace all tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, which,
with &s;o much valour and good fortune, they had ac|quired
in Germany.</P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of winter, the congre&s;s of
Nimeguen was pretty full, and the plenipotentiaries of
the Emperor and Spain, two powers &s;trictly conjoined by
blood and alliance, at la&s;t appeared. The Dutch had
threatened, if they delayed any longer, to proceed to a
<PB N="22" REF="32">
&s;eparate treaty with France. In the conferences and ne|gotiations
the di&s;po&s;itions of the parties became every
day more apparent.</P>
<P>THE Hollanders,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1677.</NOTE> loaded with debts, and harra&s;&s;ed with
taxes, were de&s;irous of putting an end to a war; in
which, be&s;ides the inconveniencies attending all leagues,
the weakne&s;s of the Spaniards, the divi&s;ions and delays
of the Germans, progno&s;ticated nothing but di&s;grace
and misfortune. Their commerce langui&s;hed; and what
gave them &s;till greater anxiety, the commerce of Eng|land,
by rea&s;on of her neutrality, flouri&s;hed extremely;
and they were apprehen&s;ive, left advantages, once lo&s;t,
would never thoroughly be regained. They had them|&s;elves
no farther motive for continuing the war, except
to &s;ecure a good frontier to Flanders; but gratitude to
their allies &s;till engaged them, to try, whether another
campaign might procure a peace, which would give
general &s;atisfaction. The Prince of Orange, urged by
motives of honour, of ambition, and of animo&s;ity again&s;t
France, endeavoured to keep them &s;teady to this re|&s;olution.</P>
<P>THE Spaniards, not to mention the other incurable
weakne&s;&s;es, into which their monarchy was fallen,
were di&s;tracted with dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions between the par|ties
of the Queen Regent and Don John, natural bro|ther-to
their young &s;overeign. Though unable of them|&s;elves
to defend Flanders, they were re&s;olute not to con|clued
a peace, which would leave it expo&s;ed to every
a&s;&s;ault or inroad; and while they made the mo&s;t mag|nificent
promi&s;es to the States, their real tru&s;t was in
the protection of England. They &s;aw, that, if that
&s;mall but important territory was once &s;ubdued by France,
the Hollanders, expo&s;ed to &s;o terrible a power, would
fall into dependance, and would endeavour, by &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ions,
to ward off that de&s;truction, to which a war it
the heart of their State mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily expo&s;e them
<PB N="23" REF="33">
They believed that Lewis, &s;en&s;ible how much greater
advantages he might reap from the alliance than from
the &s;ubjection of the Republic, which mu&s;t &s;catter its
people, and depre&s;s its commerce, would be content|ed
with very moderate conditions, and would turn his
enterprizes again&s;t his other neighbours. They thought
it impo&s;&s;ible but the people and Parliament of England,
fore&s;eeing the&s;e obvious con&s;equences, mu&s;t at la&s;t force
the King to take part in the affairs of the continent,
in which their intere&s;ts were &s;o deeply concerned. And
they tru&s;ted, that even the King him&s;elf, on the ap|proach
of &s;o great a danger, mu&s;t open his eyes, and
&s;acrifice his prejudices, in favour of France, to the &s;afety
of his own kingdoms.</P>
<P>BUT Charles here found him&s;elf entangled in &s;uch<NOTE PLACE="marg">Uncertain conduct of the King.</NOTE>
oppo&s;ite motives and engagements, as he had not re&s;o|lution
enough to break, nor patience to unravel. On
the one hand, he always regarded his alliance with
France as a &s;ure re&s;ource in ca&s;e of any commotions
among his own &s;ubjects; and whatever &s;chemes he might
have formed for enlarging his authority, or altering the
e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, it was from that quarter alone he
could expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance. He had actually in &s;ecret &s;old
his neutrality to France, and he received remittances of
a million of livres a year, which was afterwards increa&s;ed
to two millions; a con&s;iderable &s;upply in the pre&s;ent em|barra&s;&s;ed
&s;tate of his revenue. And he dreaded, le&s;t the
Parliament &s;hould treat him as they had formerly done
his father; and after they had engaged him in a war on
the continent, &s;hould take advantage of his nece&s;&s;ities,
and make him purcha&s;e &s;upplies by &s;acrificing his prero|gative,
and abandoning his mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the cries of his people and Par|liament,
&s;econded by Danby, Arlington, and mo&s;t of
his mini&s;ters, incited him to take part with the allies,
and to correct the unequal ballance of power in Europe.
<PB N="24" REF="34">
He might apprehend danger from oppo&s;ing &s;uch earne&s;t
de&s;ires: He might hope for large &s;upplies, if he con|curred
with them: And however inglorious and indolent
his di&s;po&s;ition, the renown of acting as arbiter of Eu|rope,
would probably at intervals rouze him from his
lethargy, and move him to &s;upport the high character,
with which he was inve&s;ted.</P>
<P>IT is worthy ob&s;ervation, that during this period, the
King was, by every one, abroad and at home, by
France and by the allies, allowed to be the undi&s;puted
arbiter of Europe; and no terms of peace, which he
would have pre&s;cribed, could have been refu&s;ed by ei|ther
party. Tho' France afterwards found means to re|&s;i&s;t
the &s;ame alliance, joined with England; yet was &s;he
then obliged to make &s;uch violent efforts as quite ex|hau&s;ted
her; and it was the utmo&s;t nece&s;&s;ity, which
pu&s;hed her to find re&s;ources, far &s;urpa&s;&s;ing her own ex|pectations.
Charles was &s;en&s;ible, that, &s;o long as the
war continued abroad, he &s;hould never enjoy ea&s;e at
home, from the impatience and importunity of his &s;ub|jects;
yet could he not re&s;olve to impo&s;e a peace by
openly conjoining him&s;elf with either party. Terms
advantageous to the allies mu&s;t lo&s;e him the friend&s;hip
of France; The contrary would enrage his Parliament.
Between the&s;e views, he perpetually floated; and from
his conduct, it is ob&s;ervable, that a carele&s;s, remi&s;s di&s;|po&s;ition,
agitated by oppo&s;ite, motives, is capable of as
great incon&s;i&s;tencies as is incident even to the greate&s;t
imbecillity and folly.</P>
<P>THE Parliament was a&s;&s;embled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> and the King made
them a very plau&s;ible &s;peech,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> in which he warned them
again&s;t all differences among them&s;elves; expre&s;&s;ed a
re&s;olution to do his part for bringing their con&s;ultations
to a happy i&s;&s;ue; and offered his con&s;ent to any laws for
the farther &s;ecurity of their religion, liberty, and property.
He then told them of the decayed condition of the navy;
<PB N="25" REF="35">
and a&s;ked money for repairing it: He informed them,
that part of his revenue, the additional exci&s;e, was &s;oon
to expire: And he added the&s;e words, &startq;You may at
any time &s;ee the yearly e&s;tabli&s;hed expence of the
government, by which it will appear, that the con|&s;tant
and unavoidable charge being paid, there will
remain no overplus towards an&s;wering tho&s;e contin|gencies,
which may happen in all kingdoms, and
which have been a con&s;iderable burthen on me this
la&s;t year.&endq;</P>
<P>BEFORE the parliament entered upon bu&s;ine&s;s, they
were &s;topped by a doubt which was &s;tarted concerning
the legality of their meeting. It had been enacted by
an old law of Edward the third, &startq;That Parliaments
&s;hould be held once every year, or oftner, if need
be.&endq; The la&s;t prorogation had been longer than a
year; and being $uppo&s;ed on that account illegal, it was
pretended to be equivalent to a di&s;&s;olution. The con&s;e|quence
&s;eems by no means ju&s;t; and be&s;ides, a latter act,
that which repealed the triennial law, had determined,
that it was nece&s;&s;ary to hold Parliaments only once in
three years. Such weight, however, was put on this
cavil, that Buckingham, Shafte&s;bury, Sali&s;bury, and
Wharton, in&s;i&s;ted &s;trenuou&s;ly in the Hou&s;e of Peers on
the invalidity of the Parliament, and the nullity of all
its future acts. For &s;uch dangerous po&s;itions, they were
&s;ent to the Tower, there to remain during the plea&s;ure
of his Maje&s;ty and the Hou&s;e. Buckingham, Sali&s;bury,
and Wharton made &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, and were &s;oon after re|lea&s;ed.
But Shafte&s;bury, more ob&s;tinate in his temper,
and de&s;irous of di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by his adherence
to liberty, &s;ought the remedy of law; and being rejected
by the judges, he was at la&s;t, after a twelvemonth's im|pri&s;onment,
obliged to make the &s;ame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions; upon
which he was al&s;o relea&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="26" REF="36">
THE Commons at fir&s;t &s;eemed to proceed with temper.
They granted the &s;um of 586,000 pounds, for building
thirty &s;hips; tho' they &s;trictly appropriated the money to
that &s;ervice. E&s;timates were given in of the expence;
but it was afterwards found that they fell &s;hort near
100,000 pounds. They al&s;o voted, agreeably to the
King's reque&s;t, the continuance of the additional exci&s;e
for three years. This exci&s;e had been granted for nine
years in 1668. Every thing &s;eemed to promi&s;e a peace|able
and an ea&s;y &s;e&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT the Parliament was &s;oon rou&s;ed from this tran|quillity<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1677.</NOTE>
by the news received from abroad. The French
King had taken the field in the middle of February, and
laid &s;iege to Valenciennes, which he carried in a few
days by &s;torm. He next inve&s;ted both Cambray and St.
Omer. The prince of Orange, alarmed with this pro|gre&s;s,
ha&s;tily a&s;&s;embled an army, and marched to the
relief of St. Omer. He was encountered by the French,
under the duke of Orleans and mare&s;chal Luxembourg.
The prince po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great talents for war; courage, ac|tivity,
vigilance, patience; but &s;till he was inferior in
genius to tho&s;e con&s;ummate generals, oppo&s;ed to him by
Lewis; and though he always found means to repair his
lo&s;&s;es, and to make head in a little time again&s;t the vic|tors,
he was during his whole life un&s;ucce&s;sful. By a
ma&s;terly movement of Luxembourg, he was here beat,
and obliged to retreat to Ypres. During the battle, he
made the utmo&s;t efforts, by exhortation and example, to
rally his di&s;mayed &s;oldiers: He &s;truck one of the runa|ways
acro&s;s the face with his &s;word, &startq; Ra&s;cal,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq; I will &s;et a mark on you at pre&s;ent, that I may hang
you afterwards.&endq; Cambray and St. Omer were &s;oon
&s;urrendered to Lewis.</P>
<P>THIS &s;ucce&s;s, derived from &s;uch exorbitant power
and &s;uch wi&s;e conduct, &s;truck a ju&s;t terror into the
Engli&s;h Parliament. They addre&s;&s;ed the King, repre|&s;enting
<PB N="27" REF="37">
the danger to which the kingdom was expo&s;|ed
from the greatne&s;s of France, and de&s;iring, that his
Maje&s;ty, by &s;uch alliances as he &s;hould think fit, would
both &s;ecure his own dominions and the Spani&s;h Ne|therlands,
and thereby quiet the fears of his people.
The King, de&s;irous of eluding this application, which
he con&s;idered as a kind of attack on his mea&s;ures, re|plied
in general terms, that he would u&s;e all means for
the pre&s;ervation of Flanders, con&s;i&s;tent with the peace
and &s;afety of his kingdoms. This an&s;wer was an eva|&s;ion,
or rather a real denial. The Commons, therefore,
thought proper to be more particular. They entreated
him not to defer the entering into &s;uch alliances as might
attain that great end: And in ca&s;e war with the French
King &s;hould be the re&s;ult of his mea&s;ures, they promi&s;ed
to grant him all the aids and &s;upplies, which would ena|ble
him to &s;upport the honour and intere&s;t of the nation.
The king was al&s;o more particular in his reply. He
told them, that the only way to prevent danger, was to
put him in a condition to make preparations for their &s;e|curity.
This me&s;&s;age was under&s;tood to be a demand
of money. The Parliament accordingly empowered
the king to borrow on the additional exci&s;e 200,000
pounds, at &s;even per cent: A very &s;mall &s;um indeed;
but which they deemed &s;ufficient, with the ordinary re|venue,
to equip a good &s;quadron, and thereby put the na|tion
in &s;ecurity, till farther re&s;olutions were taken.</P>
<P>BUT this conce&s;&s;ion fell far &s;hort of the King's ex|pectations.
He therefore informed them, that unle&s;s
they granted him the &s;um of 600,000 pounds upon new
funds, it would not be po&s;&s;ible for him, without expo&s;ing
the nation to manife&s;t danger, to &s;peak or act tho&s;e
things, which would an&s;wer the end of their &s;everal
addre&s;&s;es. The Hou&s;e took this me&s;&s;age into con&s;ide|ration:
But before they came to any re&s;olution, the
King &s;ent for them to Whitehall, where he told them,
<PB N="28" REF="38">
upon the word of a King, that they &s;hould not repent
any tru&s;t, which they would repo&s;e in him for the
&s;afety of his kingdoms; that he would not for any con|&s;ideration
break credit with them, or employ their mo|ney
to other u&s;es, than tho&s;e for which they intended it;
but that he would not hazard, either his own &s;afety
or theirs, by taking any vigorous mea&s;ures, or forming
new alliances, till he was in a better condition, both
to defend his &s;ubjects, and offend his enemies. This
&s;peech brought affairs to a &s;hort i&s;&s;ue. The King re|quired
them to tru&s;t him with a large &s;um: He pawned
his royal word for their &s;ecurity: They mu&s;t either
run the ri&s;que of lo&s;ing their money, or endanger tho&s;e
alliances they had projected, and at the &s;ame time de|clare
to all the world the highe&s;t di|&s;tru&s;t of their &s;o|vereign.</P>
<P>BUT there were many rea&s;ons which determined the<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament's di&s;tru&s;t of the King.</NOTE>
Hou&s;e of Commons to put no tru&s;t in his Maje&s;ty.
They con&s;idered, that the pretence of danger was ob|viously
groundle&s;s; while the French were oppo&s;ed by
&s;uch powerful alliances on the continent, while the
King was ma&s;ter of a good fleet at &s;ea, and while all
his &s;ubjects were &s;o heartily united in oppo&s;ition to fo|reign
enemies. That the only ju&s;tifiable rea&s;on, there|fore,
of the King's backwardne&s;s, was not the apprehen|&s;ion
of danger from abroad, but a diffidence, which he
might perhaps have entertained of his Parliament; le&s;t,
after engaging him in foreign alliances for carrying on
a war, they &s;hould take advantage of his nece&s;&s;ities,
and extort from him conce&s;&s;ions dangerous to his royal
dignity. That this Parliament, by their pa&s;t conduct,
had given no foundation for &s;uch &s;u&s;picions, and were
&s;o far from pur&s;uing any &s;ini&s;ter ends, that they had
granted &s;upplies for the fir&s;t Dutch war; for maintain|ing
the triple league, though concluded without their
advice; even for carrying on the &s;econd Dutch war; which
<PB N="29" REF="39">
was entered into contrary to their opinion, and contrary
to the manife&s;t intere&s;ts of the nation. That on the
other hand, the King had, by former mea&s;ures, excited
very rea&s;onable jealou&s;ies in his people, and did with a
bad grace require at pre&s;ent their tru&s;t and confidence.
That he had not &s;crupled to demand &s;upplies for main|taining
the triple league, at the very moment he was
concerting mea&s;ures for breaking it, and had accordingly
employed to that purpo&s;e the &s;upplies, which he had ob|tained
by tho&s;e delu&s;ive preten&s;ions. That his union
with France, during the war again&s;t Holland, mu&s;t have
been founded on projects the mo&s;t dangerous to his peo|ple;
and as the &s;ame union was &s;till &s;ecretly maintained,
it might ju&s;tly be feared, that the &s;ame projects were
not yet entirely abandoned. That the King could not
&s;eriou&s;ly intend to pro&s;ecute vigorous mea&s;ures again&s;t
France; &s;ince he had &s;o long remained entirely uncon|cerned
during &s;uch obvious dangers, and, till prompted
by his Parliament, who&s;e proper bu&s;ine&s;s it was not to
take the lead in tho&s;e parts of admini&s;tration, had &s;u&s;|pended
all his activity. That if he really meant to enter
into a cordial union with his people, he would have
taken the fir&s;t &s;tep, and have endeavoured, by putting
tru&s;t in them, to re&s;tore that confidence, which he him|&s;elf,
by his ra&s;h councils, had fir&s;t violated. That it
was in vain to a&s;k &s;o &s;mall a &s;um as 600,000 pounds, in
order to &s;ecure him again&s;t the future attempts of the
Parliament; &s;ince that &s;um mu&s;t &s;oon be exhau&s;ted by a
war with France, and he mu&s;t again fall into that depen|dance,
which was become in &s;ome degree e&s;&s;ential to the
con&s;titution. That if he would form the nece&s;&s;ary alli|ances,
that &s;um or a greater would in&s;tantly be voted;
nor could there be any rea&s;on to dread, that the parlia|ment
would immediately de&s;ert mea&s;ures, in which they
were engaged by their honour, their inclination, and the
public intere&s;t. That the real ground, therefore, of
<PB N="30" REF="40">
the King's refu&s;al was neither apprehen&s;ion of danger
from foreign enemies, nor jealou&s;y of parliamentary en|croachments;
but a de&s;ire of obtaining the money,
which he intended, notwith&s;tanding his royal word, to
employ to other purpo&s;es. And that by u&s;ing &s;uch di&s;|honourable
means to &s;o ignoble an end, he rendered
him&s;elf &s;till more unworthy the confidence of his
people.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Commons were now regularly divided
into two parties, the court and the country. Some were
inli&s;ted in the court-party by offices, nay a few by bribes
&s;ecretly given them; a &s;candalous practice fir&s;t begun by
Clifford, a pernicious mini&s;ter: But great numbers were
attached merely by inclination; &s;o far as they e&s;teemed the
mea&s;ures of the Court agreeable to the intere&s;ts of the nation.
Private views and faction had likewi&s;e drawn many into
the country party: But there were al&s;o many, who had no

members on both &s;ides fluctuated between the parties; and
gave the &s;uperiority &s;ometimes to the Court, &s;ometimes to
the oppo&s;ition<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Temple's Memoirs, vol. i. p. 458.</NOTE>. In the pre&s;ent emergence, a general
di&s;tru&s;t of the King prevailed; and the Parliament re|&s;olved
not to hazard their money, in expectation of alli|ances,
which, they believed, were never intended to be
formed. In&s;tead of granting the &s;upply, they voted an
addre&s;s, wherein &startq; they be&s;ought his maje&s;ty to enter

for pre&s;erving his Maje&s;ty's honour and the &s;afety

of the public. The King pretended the highe&s;t anger
at this addre&s;s, which he repre&s;ented as a dange|rous
encroachment upon his prerogative. He reproved
the Commons in very &s;evere terms; and ordered them
immediately to be adjourned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">8th of May.</NOTE></P>
<P>IT is certain, that this was the critical moment, when
the King both might with ea&s;e have pre&s;erved the ba|lance
of power in Europe, which it has &s;ince co&s;t this
i&s;land an infinite profu&s;ion of blood and trea&s;ure to re|&s;tore,
and might by per&s;everance have at la&s;t regained,
in &s;ome tolerable mea&s;ure, after all pa&s;t, errors, the con|fidence
of his people. This opportunity being neglected,
the wound became incurable; and notwith&s;tanding <HI>his</HI>

and <HI>their</HI> momentary inclinations to rely on his
faith; <HI>he</HI> was &s;till believed to be at bottom engaged in
the &s;ame intere&s;t, and <HI>they</HI> &s;oon relap&s;ed into di&s;tru&s;t and

King had at this time concerted mea&s;ures with France,
and had no intention to enter into a war in favour of the
allies. He had entertained no view, therefore, even
when he pawned his ROY&Aacute;L WORD to his people, than
to procure a grant of money; and he tru&s;ted, that,
while he eluded their expectations, he could not after|wards
want pretences for palliating his conduct.</P>
<P>NEGOTIATIONS mean while were carried on between
France and Holland, and an eventual treaty was con|cluded;
that is, all their differences were adju&s;ted, pro|vided
they could afterwards &s;atisfy their allies on both
&s;ides. But this work, though in appearance difficult,
<PB N="32" REF="42">
&s;eemed to be extremely forwarded, by farther bad &s;uc|ce&s;&s;es
on the part of the confederates, and by the
great impatience of the Hollanders; when a new
event happened, which promi&s;ed a more pro&s;perous i&s;&s;ue
to the quarrel with France, and revived extremely the
hopes of all the Engli&s;h who under&s;tood the intere&s;ts of
their country.</P>
<P>THE King &s;aw, with regret, the violent di&s;con|tents,
which prevailed in the nation, and which &s;eemed
every day to augment upon him. Strongly de&s;irous by
his natural temper to be ea&s;y him&s;elf, and to make every
body el&s;e ea&s;y, he &s;ought expedients to appea&s;e tho&s;e
murmurs, which, as they were very di&s;agreeable for the pre|&s;ent,
might in their con&s;equences prove extremely dan|gerous.
He knew, that, during the late war with Hol|land,
the malecontents at home had made applications to the
prince of Orange; and if he continued &s;till to neglect
the prince's intere&s;ts, and to thwart the inclinations of
his people, he apprehended le&s;t their common complaints
&s;hould cement a la&s;ting union between them. He &s;aw
that the religion of the Duke in&s;pired the nation with
very di&s;mal apprehen&s;ions; and though he had obliged
his brother to allow the young prince&s;&s;es to be educated
in the prote&s;tant faith, &s;omething farther, he thought,
was requi&s;ite, in order to &s;atisfy the nation. He enter|tained
therefore propo&s;als for marrying the prince to the
lady Mary, the elde&s;t prince&s;s, and heir apparent to the
crown (for the duke had no male i&s;&s;ue.) And he hoped;
by &s;o tempting an offer, to engage him entirely in his
intere&s;ts. A peace he propo&s;ed to make; &s;uch as would
&s;atisfy France, and &s;till pre&s;erve his connexions with that
crown: And he intended to &s;anctify it by the approba|tion
of the prince, whom he found to be extremely re|vered
in England, and re&s;pected throughout all Europe&punc;
All the rea&s;ons for this alliance were &s;econded by the
&s;ollicitations of Danby, and al&s;o of Temple, who was
<PB N="33" REF="43">
at the time in England: And Charles at la&s;t granted
permi&s;&s;ion to the prince, when the campaign &s;hould be
over, to pay him a vi&s;it.</P>
<P>THE King Very graciou&s;ly received his nephew at<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of Oc|tober.</NOTE>
Newmarket. He would have entered immediately upon
bu&s;ine&s;s; but the prince de&s;ired fir&s;t to be acquainted
with the lady Mary: And he declared, that, contrary
to the u&s;ual &s;entiments of per&s;ons of his rank, he placed
a great part of happine&s;s in dome&s;tic &s;atisfaction, and
would not, upon any con&s;ideration of intere&s;t or poli|tics,
match him&s;elf with a per&s;on disagreeable to him.
He was introduced to the prince&s;s, whom he found in
the bloom of youth, and extremely amiable both in her
per&s;on and her humour. The King now thought, that
he had a double tye upon him, and might &s;afely make
account of his compliance with every propo&s;al: He was
&s;urprized to find the prince decline all di&s;cour&s;e of bu&s;i|ne&s;s,
and refu&s;e to concert any terms for the general
peace, till his marriage &s;hould be fini&s;hed. He well fore|&s;aw,
he &s;aid, from the &s;ituation of affairs, that his allies
were likely to have hard terms; and he never would ex|po&s;e
him&s;elf to the reproach of having &s;acrificed their in|tere&s;ts
to promote his own purpo&s;es. Charles &s;till be|lieved;
notwith&s;tanding the cold, &s;evere manner of the
prince, that he would abate of this rigid punctilio of ho|nour;
and he protracted the time, hoping by his own
in&s;inuation and addre&s;s, as well as by the allurements of
love and ambition, to win him to compliance. One day,
Temple found the prince in very bad humour, repent|ing
that he had ever come to England, and re&s;olute in a
few days to leave it. But before he went, the King, he
&s;aid, mu&s;t chu&s;e the terms, on which they &s;hould here|after
live together: He was &s;ure it mu&s;t be like the
greates;t friends or the greate&s;t enemies: And he de&s;ired
Temple to inform his Ma&s;ter next morning of the&s;e in|tentions.
Charles was &s;truck with his menace, and
<PB N="34" REF="44">
fore&s;aw how the prince's departure would be interpreted
by the people. He re&s;olved, therefore, immediately to
yield with a good grace; and having paid a compliment
to his nephew's hone&s;ty, he told Temple, that the mar|riage
was concluded, and de&s;ired him to, inform the
Duke of it,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of Octo|ber.</NOTE> as of an affair already re&s;olved on. The duke
&s;eemed &s;urprized;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Marriage of the prince of Orange with the lady Mary.</NOTE> but yielded a prompt obedience:
Which, he &s;aid, was his con&s;tant maxim to whatever
he found to be the King's plea&s;ure. No mea&s;ure during
this reign gave &s;uch general &s;atisfaction. All parties
&s;trove who &s;hould mo&s;t applaud it. And even Arlington,
who had been kept out of the &s;ecret, told the prince,
&startq; That &s;ome things, good in them&s;elves, were &s;poiled
by the manner of doing them, as &s;ome things bad
were mended by it; but he would confe&s;s, that this
was a thing &s;o good in it&s;elf, that the manner of do|ing
it could not &s;poil it.&endq;</P>
<P>THIS marriage was a great &s;urprize to Lewis, who,
being accu&s;tomed to govern every thing in the Engli&s;h
Court, now found &s;o important a &s;tep taken, not only
without his con&s;ent, but without his knowlege or parti|cipation.
A conjunction of England with the allies, and
a vigorous war in oppo&s;ition to French ambition, were
the con&s;equences immediately expected, both abroad and
at home: But to check the&s;e &s;anguine expectations, the
King, a few days after the marriage, prolonged the ad|journment
of the Parliament from the third of Decem|ber
to the fourth of April. This term was too late for
granting &s;upplies, or making preparations for war; and
could be cho&s;en by the King for no other rea&s;on, but as
an atonement to France for his con&s;ent to the marriage.</P>
<P>THE King, however, entered into con&s;ultations with
the prince,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Plan of peace.</NOTE> together with Danby and Temple, con|cerning
the terms which it would be proper to require
of France. After &s;ome debate, it was agreed, that
France &s;hould re&s;tore Lorrain to the Duke; with Tour|nay,
<PB N="35" REF="45">
Valenciennes, Cond&eacute;, Aeth, Charleroi, Courtray,
Oudenarde, and Binche to Spain, in order to form a
good frontier for Flanders. The prince in&s;i&s;ted much,
that Franchecomt&eacute; &s;hould likewi&s;e be re&s;tored; and
Charles thought, that becau&s;e he had patrimonial e&s;tates
of great value in that province, and deemed his property
more &s;ecure in the hands of Spain, he was engaged by
&s;uch views to be ob&s;tinate in that point: But the prince
very generou&s;ly declared, that to procure but one good
town to the Spaniards in Flanders, he would willingly
abandon all tho&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions. As the King &s;till in&s;i&s;ted
on the impo&s;&s;ibility of wre&s;ting Franchecomt&eacute; from
Lewis, the prince was obliged to &s;ubmit.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING this conce&s;&s;ion to France, the
projected peace was favourable to the allies; and it was
a &s;ufficient indication of vigour in the King, that he had
given his a&s;&s;ent to it. He farther agreed to &s;end over a
mini&s;ter in&s;tantly to Paris, in order to propo&s;e the&s;e
terms. This mini&s;ter was to enter into no treaty:
He was to allow but two days for the acceptance or re|fu&s;al
of the terms: Upon the expiration, of the&s;e, he was
immediately to return: And in ca&s;e of refu&s;al, the King
promi&s;ed immediately to enter into the confederacy. To
carry &s;o imperious a me&s;&s;age, and &s;o little expected from
the Engli&s;h Court, Temple was the per&s;on pitched on,
who&s;e declared aver&s;ion to the French intere&s;t was not
likely to make him fail of vigour and promptitude in the
execution of has commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BUT Charles next day felt a relenting in this a&s;&s;umed
vigour. In&s;tead of Temple he di&s;patched the carl of Fe|ver&s;ham,
a creature of the Duke's, and a Frenchman by
birth: And he &s;aid, that the me&s;&s;age being har&s;h in it|&s;elf,
it was needle&s;s to aggravate it by a di&s;agreeable
me&s;&s;enger. The prince left London; and the King;
at his departure, a&s;&s;ured him, that he never would
abate in the lea&s;t point of the &s;cheme concerted,
<PB N="36" REF="46">
and would enter into war with Lewis, if he refu&s;ed
it.</P>
<P>LEWIS received the me&s;&s;age with &s;eeming gentlene&s;s
and complacency.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotia|tions.</NOTE> He told Fever&s;ham, that the King of
England well knew, that he might always be ma&s;ter of
the peace; but &s;ome of the towns in Flanders, it &s;eemed
very hard to demand, e&s;pecially Tournay, upon who&s;e
fortifications &s;uch immen&s;e &s;ums had been expended:
He would therefore take &s;ome &s;hort time to con&s;ider of
an an&s;wer. Fever&s;ham &s;aid, that he was limited to two
days &s;tay: But when that time was elap&s;ed, he was pre|vailed
with to &s;tay &s;ome few days longer; and he came
away at la&s;t without any po&s;itive an&s;wer. Lewis &s;aid,
that he hoped his brother would not break with him for
one or two towns: And with regard to them too, he
would &s;end orders to his amba&s;&s;ador at London to treat
with the King him&s;elf. Charles was &s;oftened by the
&s;oftne&s;s of France; and the blow was thus artfully
eluded. The French amba&s;&s;ador, Barillon, owned, at
la&s;t, that he had orders to yield all except Tournay, and
even to treat about &s;ome equivalent for that fortre&s;s, if
the King ab&s;olutely in&s;i&s;ted upon it. The prince was
gone, who had given &s;pirit to the Engli&s;h Court; and
the negotiation began to draw out into me&s;&s;ages and re|turns
from Paris.</P>
<P>BY intervals, however, the King could rouze him&s;elf,
and &s;how &s;till &s;ome firmne&s;s and re&s;olution. Finding that
affairs were not likely to come to any conclu&s;ion with
France, the Parliament, notwith&s;tanding the long ad|journment,
was a&s;&s;embled on the fifteenth of January;
a very unu&s;ual mea&s;ure, and capable of giving alarm to
the French Court. Temple was &s;ent for to the coun|cil,
and the King told him, that he intended he &s;hould
go to Holland, in order to form a treaty of alliance with
the States; and that the purpo&s;es of it &s;hould be, like
the triple league, to force both France and Spain to ac|cept
<PB N="37" REF="47">
of the terms propo&s;ed. Temple was &s;orry to find
this act of vigour qualified by &s;uch a regard to France,
and by &s;uch an appearance of indifference and neutra|lity
between the parties. He told the King, that the re|&s;olution
agreed on, was to begin the war in conjunc|tion
with all the confederates, in ca&s;e of no direct and
immediate an&s;wer from France: That this mea&s;ure
would &s;atisfy the prince, the allies, and the people of
England; advantages which could not be expected from
&s;uch an alliance with Holland alone: That France
would be di&s;obliged, and Spain likewi&s;e; nor would
the Dutch be &s;atisfied with &s;uch a faint imitation of the
triple league, a mea&s;ure concerted when they were
equally at peace with both parties. For the&s;e rea&s;ons,
Temple declined the employment; and Laurence Hyde,
&s;econd &s;on to chancellor Clarendon, was &s;ent in his
place.</P>
<P>THE prince of Orange was &s;urprized to ob&s;erve &s;uch
&s;ymptoms of weakne&s;s and vigour conjoined in the Engli&s;h
councils.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1678.</NOTE> He was re&s;olved, however, to make the be&s;t of
a mea&s;ure, which he did not approve; and as Spain &s;e|cretly
con&s;ented, that her ally &s;hould form a league,
which was &s;eemingly directed again&s;t her as well as
France, but which was to fall only on the latter, the
States concluded the treaty in the terms propo&s;ed by the<NOTE PLACE="marg">6th of Ja|nuary.</NOTE>
King.</P>
<P>MEANWHILE, the Engli&s;h Parliament met, after &s;ome
new delays;<NOTE PLACE="marg">28th of Ja|nuary.</NOTE> and the King was a&s;toni&s;hed, that, not|with&s;tanding
all the re&s;olute mea&s;ures, which, he
thought, he had taken, great di&s;tru&s;t and jealou&s;y and
di&s;content were apt, at intervals, &s;till to prevail among
the members. Though in his &s;peech he had allowed,
that a good peace could no longer be expected from ne|gotiation,
and a&s;&s;ured them, that he was re&s;olved to en|ter
into war for that purpo&s;e; the Commons did not for|bear
to in&s;ert in their reply &s;everal very har&s;h and even

unrea&s;onable clau&s;es. Upon his reproving them, they
&s;eemed penitent, and voted, that they would a&s;&s;i&s;t his Ma|je&s;ty
in the pro&s;ecution of the war. A fleet of ninety
&s;ail, an army of thirty thou&s;and men, and a million of
money were al&s;o voted. Great difficulties were made by
the Commons with regard to the army, which the
Hou&s;e, judging by pa&s;t mea&s;ures, believed to be intended
more again&s;t the liberties of England than again&s;t the
progre&s;s of the French Monarch. To this perilous &s;itu|ation
had the King reduced both him&s;elf and the nation.
In all debates, &s;evere &s;peeches were made, and were re|ceived
with a &s;eeming approbation: The Duke and the
trea&s;urer began to be apprehen&s;ive of impeachments:
Many motions again&s;t the King's mini&s;ters were lo&s;t by
a very &s;mall majority: The Commons appointed a day
to con&s;ider the &s;tate of the kingdom with regard to po|pery:
And they even went &s;o far as to vote, that, how
urgent &s;oever the occa&s;ion, they would lay no farther
charge on the people, till &s;ecured again&s;t the prevalence
of the catholic party. In &s;hort, the Parliament were
impatient for war whenever the King &s;eemed aver&s;e to
it; but grew &s;u&s;picious of &s;ome &s;ini&s;ter de&s;ign &s;o &s;oon as
he complied with their reque&s;ts, and &s;eemed to enter
into their mea&s;ures.</P>
<P>THE King was enraged at this la&s;t vote: He reproach|ed
Temple with his popular notions, as he termed them;
and a&s;ked him how he thought the Hou&s;e of Commons
could be tru&s;ted for carrying on the war, &s;hould it be en|tered
on, when in the very commencement they made
&s;uch declarations. The uncertainties indeed of Charles's
conduct were &s;o multiplied, and the jealou&s;ies on both
&s;ides &s;o incurable, that even tho&s;e who approached
neare&s;t the &s;cene of action could not determine, whe|ther
the King ever &s;eriou&s;ly meant to enter into war, or
whether, if he did, the Hou&s;e of Commons would
not have taken advantage of his ncce&s;&s;ities, and
<PB N="39" REF="51">
made him purcha&s;e &s;upplies by a great &s;acrifice of his
authority<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. I. p. 461.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King of France knew how to avail him&s;elf of
all the advantages, which the&s;e di&s;tractons afforded him.
By his emi&s;&s;aries, he repre&s;ented to the Dutch, the un|certainty
of their dependance on England; where an in|dolent
King, aver&s;e to all war, e&s;pecially with France,
and irre&s;olute in his mea&s;ures, was actuated only by the
uncertain breath of a factious Parliament. To the ari&s;to|cratic
faction, he remarked the danger of the Prince's
alliance with the Royal Family of England, and revived
their apprehen&s;ions, le&s;t, in imitation of his father, who
had been honoured with the &s;ame alliance, he &s;hould vio|lently
attempt to enlarge his authority, and en&s;lave his
native country.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Campaign of 1678.</NOTE> In order to &s;econd the&s;e motives with
&s;ome farther terrors, he him&s;elf took the field very early
in the &s;pring; and after threatning Luxembourg, Mons,
and Namur, he &s;at down &s;uddenly before Ghent and
Ypres, and in a few weeks made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of both
places. This &s;ucce&s;s gave great alarm to the Hollanders,
who were no wi&s;e &s;atisfied with the conduct of England,
or with the ambiguous treaty lately concluded; and it
quickened all their paces towards an accommodation.</P>
<P>IMMEDIATELY after the Parliament had voted the
&s;upply, the King began to inli&s;t forces; and &s;uch was
the ardour of the Engli&s;h for a war with France, that an
army of above 20,000 men, to the a&s;toni&s;hment of all
Europe, were compleated in a few weeks. Three thou|&s;and
men, under the duke of Monmouth, were &s;ent
over to &s;ecure O&s;tend: Some regiments were recalled
from the French &s;ervice: A fleet was fitted out with
great diligence: And a quadruple alliance was projected
between England, Holland, Spain, and the Emperor.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e vigorous mea&s;ures received a &s;udden damp
from a pa&s;&s;ionate addre&s;s of the lower Hou&s;e; in which
<PB N="40" REF="52">
they ju&s;tified all their pa&s;t proceedings, that had given
di&s;gu&s;t to the King; de&s;ired to be acquainted with the
mea&s;ures taken by him; prayed him to di&s;mi&s;s evil
coun&s;ellors; and named in particular the duke of Lau|derdale,
on who&s;e removal they &s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted.
The King told them, that their addre&s;s was &s;o extrava|gant,
that he was not willing &s;peedily to give it the an|&s;wer,
which it de&s;erved. And he began again to lend
an ear to the propo&s;als of France, who offered him great
&s;ums of money, if he would con&s;ent to their making an,
advantageous peace with the allies.</P>
<P>TEMPLE, though pre&s;&s;ed by the King, refu&s;ed to
have any concern in &s;o di&s;honourable a negotia|tion:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Negotiations.</NOTE> But
he informs us, that the King &s;aid, there was one arti|cle
propo&s;ed, which &s;o incen&s;ed him, that, as long as he
lived, he would never forget it. Sir William goes no
farther; but the editor of his works, the famous Dr.
Swift, &s;ays, that the French, before they would agree
to any payment, required as a preliminary, that the King
&s;hould engage never to keep above 8000 regular troops in
his three kingdoms. Charles broke into a pa&s;&s;ion.
&startq; Cod's-fi&s;h,&endq; &s;aid he, his u&s;ual oath, &startq; Does my
brother of France think to &s;erve me thus? Are all his
promi&s;es to make me ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of my people
come to this? Or does he think <HI>that</HI> a thing to be
done with eight thou&s;and men?&endq;</P>
<P>VAN BEVERNING was the Dutch amba&s;&s;ador at Ni|meguen,
a man of great authority with the States. He
was very eager for peace, and was per&s;waded, that the
reluctance of the King and the jealou&s;ies of the Parlia|ment
would for ever di&s;appoint the allies in their hopes of
&s;uccour from England. Orders were &s;ent him by the
States to go to the French King at Ghent, and concert
the terms of a general treaty, as well as procure a pre|&s;ent
truce for &s;ix weeks. The terms agreed on were
much wor&s;e for the Spaniards, than tho&s;e planned by
<PB N="41" REF="53">
the King and the Prince of Orange. Six towns, &s;ome
of them of no great importance, were to be re&s;tored to
them: But Ypres, Cond&eacute;, Valenciennes, and Tour|nay,
in which con&s;i&s;ted the chief &s;trength of their fron|tier,
were to remain with France.</P>
<P>GREAT murmurs aro&s;e in England when it was
known, that Flanders was to be left in &s;o defencele&s;s a
condition. The chief complaints were levelled again&s;t
the King, who, by his concurrence at fir&s;t, by his favour
afterwards, and by his delays at la&s;t, had rai&s;ed the
power of France to &s;uch an enormous height, that it
threatened the general liberties of Europe. Charles,
unea&s;y under the&s;e imputations, dreading the con&s;e|quence
of lo&s;ing the affections of his &s;ubjects, and per|haps
di&s;gu&s;ted with the &s;ecret article propo&s;ed by France,
began to wi&s;h heartily for war, which, he hoped, would
have re&s;tored him to his antient popularity.</P>
<P>AN opportunity very unexpectedly offered it&s;elf for his
di&s;playing the&s;e new di&s;po&s;itions. While the amba&s;&s;a|dors
at Nimeguen were concerting the terms of a gene|ral
treaty, the marquis de Balbaces, the Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;a|dor,
a&s;ked the amba&s;&s;adors of France, at what time
France intended to re&s;tore the &s;ix towns in Flanders.
They made no difficulty of declaring, that the King,
their ma&s;ter, being obliged to &s;ee an entire re&s;titution
made to the Swedes of all they had lo&s;t in the war,
could not evacuate the&s;e towns, till that Crown had re|ceived
&s;atisfaction; and that this detention of places
was the only means to induce the Princes of the North
to accept of the peace.</P>
<P>THE States immediately gave the King intelligence of
a preten&s;ion, which might be attended with &s;uch dange|rous
con&s;equences. The king was both &s;urprized and
angry. He immediately di&s;patched Temple to concert
with the States vigorous mea&s;ures for oppo&s;ing France.<NOTE PLACE="marg">16th of July.</NOTE>
Temple in &s;ix days concluded a treaty, by which Lewis
<PB N="42" REF="54">
was obliged to declare within &s;ixteen after the date, that
he would pre&s;ently evacuate the towns: And in ca&s;e of
his refu&s;al, Holland was engaged to continue the war,
and England immediately to declare again&s;t France, in
conjunction with the whole confederacy.</P>
<P>ALL the&s;e warlike mea&s;ures were &s;o little &s;econded by
the Parliament, where even the French mini&s;ters were
&s;u&s;pected of carrying on &s;ome intrigues, that the Com|mons
renewed their former jealou&s;ies again&s;t the King,
and voted the army immediately to be di&s;banded. The
King by a me&s;&s;age repre&s;ented the danger of di&s;arming
before peace was concluded; and he recommended to
their con&s;ideration, whether he could honourably recall
his forces from tho&s;e towns in Flanders, which had put
them&s;elves under his protection, and which had at pre|&s;ent
no other means of defence. The Commons agreed
to prolong the term with regard to the&s;e forces. Every
thing indeed in Europe wore the appearance of war.
France had po&s;itively declared, that &s;he would not eva|cuate
the towns before the requi&s;ite ce&s;&s;ion was made
to Sweden; and her honour &s;eemed now engaged to &s;up|port
that declaration. Spain and the Empire, extremely
di&s;gu&s;ted with the terms of peace, impo&s;ed by Holland,
&s;aw with plea&s;ure the pro&s;pect of a powerful &s;upport from
the new re&s;olutions of Charles. Holland it&s;elf, encou|raged
by the Prince of Orange and his party, was not
di&s;plea&s;ed to find that the war would be renewed on more
equal terms. The allied army under that Prince was ap|proaching
towards Mons, then blockaded by France. A
con&s;iderable body of Engli&s;h forces under the duke of
Monmouth, were ready to join him.</P>
<P>CHARLES u&s;ually pa&s;&s;ed a great part of his time in the
women's apartments, particularly tho&s;e of the dutche&s;s
of Port&s;mouth; where, among other gay company, he
often met with Barillon, the French amba&s;&s;ador, a man of
polite conver&s;ation, who was admitted into all the amu&s;e|ments
<PB N="43" REF="55">
of that inglorious, but agreeable monarch. It was
the charms of this &s;auntering ea&s;y life, which, during the
latter part of his life, attached Charles to his mi&s;tre&s;&s;es.
By the in&s;inuations of Barillon and the dutche&s;s of Port&s;|mouth,
an order was, in an unguarded hour, procured,
which in&s;tantly changed the face of affairs in Europe.
One du Cros, a French fugitive monk, was &s;ent to
Temple, directing him to apply to the Swedi&s;h amba&s;&s;a|dor,
and per&s;wade him not to in&s;i&s;t on the conditions re|quired
by France, but to &s;acrifice to general peace tho&s;e
intere&s;ts of Sweden. Du Cros, who had &s;ecretly re|ceived
in&s;tructions from Barillon, publi&s;hed every where
in Holland the commi&s;&s;ion, with which he was intru&s;ted;
and all men took, the alarm. It was concluded, that
Charles's &s;udden alacrity for war was as &s;uddenly extin|gui&s;hed,
and that no &s;teady mea&s;ures could ever be taken
with England. The King afterwards, when he &s;aw Tem|ple,
treated this important matter in raillery; and &s;aid
laughing, that the rogue du Cros had outwitted them
all.</P>
<P>THE negotiations however at Nimeguen &s;till conti|nued;
and the French amba&s;&s;adors &s;pun out the time, till
the morning of the fatal day, which, by the late treaty
between England and Holland, was to determine, whe|ther
a &s;udden peace or a long war was to have place in
Chri&s;tendom. The French amba&s;&s;adors came then to
Van Beverning, and told him, that they had received or|ders
to con&s;ent to the evacuation of the towns, and im|mediately
to conclude and &s;ign the peace.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1&s;t of Au|gu&s;t.</NOTE> Van Bevern|ing
might have refu&s;ed compliance, becau&s;e it was now
impo&s;&s;ible to procure the con&s;ent and concurrence of
Spain; but he had entertained &s;o ju&s;t an idea of the fluc|tuations
in the Engli&s;h councils, and was &s;o much alarm|ed
by the late commi&s;&s;ion given to du Cros, that he
deemed it fortunate for the Republic to conclude on any
terms a dangerous war where they were likely to be
<PB N="44" REF="56" MS="Y">
very ill &s;upported. The papers were in&s;tantly drawn up,
and &s;igned by the mini&s;ters of France and Holland be|tween
eleven and twelve a clock at night. By this treaty,
France &s;ecured the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of Franchecomt&eacute;, together
with Cambray, Aire, St. Omer, Valenciennes, Tour|nay,
Ypres, Bouchaine, Ca&s;&s;el, &amp;c. and re&s;tored to
Spain only Charleroi, Courtrai, Oudenard, Aeth, Ghent,
and Limbourg.</P>
<P>NEXT day Temple received an expre&s;s from England,
which brought the ratifications of the treaty lately con|cluded
with the States, with orders immediately to pro|ceed
to the exchange of them. Charles was now returned
to his former inclinations for war with France.</P>
<P>VAN BEVERNING was loudly exclaimed again&s;t by the
amba&s;&s;adors of the allies at Nimeguen, e&s;pecially tho&s;e of
Brandenburg arid Denmark, who&s;e ma&s;ters were obliged
by the treaty to re&s;tore all their acqui&s;itions. The mini|&s;ters
of Spain and the Emperor were fullen and di&s;|gu&s;ted;
and all men hoped, that the States, importuned
and encouraged by continual &s;ollicitations from England,
would di&s;avow their amba&s;&s;ador, and renew the war. The
Prince of Orange even took a very extraordinary &s;tep,
in order to engage them to that mea&s;ure; or perhaps to
give vent to his own &s;pleen and re&s;entment. The day
after &s;igning the peace at Nimeguen, he attacked the
French army at St. Dennis hear Mons; and gained &s;ome
advantage over Luxembourg, who re&s;ted &s;ecure on the
faith of the treaty, and concluded the war to be fini&s;hed.
The Prince knew, at lea&s;t had rea&s;on to believe, that
the peace was &s;igned, though it had not been formally
notified to him; and he here &s;acrificed wantonly, with|out
a proper motive, the lives of many brave men on
both &s;ides, who fell in this &s;harp and well conte&s;ted
action.</P>
<P>HYDE was &s;ent over with a view of per&s;wading the
States to di&s;avow Van Beverning; and the King pro|mi&s;ed,
<PB N="45" REF="57">
that England, if &s;he might depend on Holland,
would immediately declare war, and would pur&s;ue it,
till France was reduced to rea&s;onable conditions. Charles
at pre&s;ent went farther than words. He hurried on the
embarkation of his army for Flanders, and all his prepa|rations
wore a ho&s;tile appearance. But the States had
been too often deceived to tru&s;t him any longer. They
ratified the treaty &s;igned at Nimeguen; and all the other
Powers of Europe were at la&s;t,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Peace of Nimeguen$</NOTE> after much clamour and
many di&s;gu&s;ts, obliged to accept of the terms pre&s;cribed
to them.</P>
<P>LEWIS had now reached the height of that glory,
which ambition can afford. His mini&s;ters and negotia|tors
appeared as much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of all Europe in
the cabinet, as his generals and armies had been expe|rienced
in the field. A &s;ucce&s;sful war had been carried
on again&s;t an alliance, compo&s;ed of the greate&s;t Poten|tates
in Europe. Con&s;iderable conque&s;ts had been made,
and his territories enlarged on every &s;ide. An advanta|geous
peace was at la&s;t concluded, where he had given
the law. The allies were &s;o enraged again&s;t each other,
that they were not likely to cement &s;oon in any new
confederacy. And thus he had, during &s;ome years, a
real and near pro&s;pect of attaining the Monarchy of Eu|rope,
and of exceeding the Empire of Charlemagne, per|haps
equalling that of antient Rome. Had England con|tinued
much longer in the &s;ame condition, and under the
&s;ame government, it is not ea&s;y to conceive, that he
could have failed of his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>IN proportion as the&s;e circum&s;tances exalted the
French, they excited indignation among the Engli&s;h,
who&s;e animo&s;ity, rouzed by terror, mounted to a great
height again&s;t that rival nation. In&s;tead of taking the
lead in the affairs of Europe, Charles, they thought, had,
contrary to his own honour and intere&s;t, acted a part
entirely &s;ub&s;ervient to the common enemy, and in all his
<PB N="46" REF="58">
&s;ures had either no project at all, or &s;uch as was highly,
criminal and dangerous. While Spain, Holland, the
Emperor, the Princes of Germany called aloud on Eng|land
to lead them to victory and to liberty, and con|&s;pired
to rai&s;e her to a &s;tation more glorious than &s;he had
ever before attained; her King, from mean pecuniary
views, had &s;ecretly &s;old his alliance to Lewis, and was
bribed into an intere&s;t contrary to that of his people.
His active &s;chemes in conjunction with France were
highly pernicious; his neutrality was equally ignomini|ous;
and the jealous, refractory behaviour of the Parlia|ment,
though in it&s;elf dangerous, was the only remedy
for &s;o many greater ills, with which the public, from the
mi&s;guided councils of the King, was &s;o nearly threaten|ed.
Such were the di&s;po&s;itions of men's minds at the
conclu&s;ion of the Peace of Nimeguen: And the&s;e di&s;po|&s;itions
very naturally prepared the way for the events
which followed.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t now return to the affairs of Scotland; which
we left in &s;ome di&s;order, after the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the in|&s;urrection
in 1666. The King, who at that time en|deavoured
to render him&s;elf popular in England, adopt|ed
like mea&s;ures in Scotland, and he entru&s;ted the go|vernment
chiefly into the hands of Tweddale, and Sir
Robert Murray, men of prudence and moderation. The&s;e
mini&s;ters made it their principal, occupation to compo&s;e
the religious differences, which ran very high, and for
which &s;carce any modern nation but the Dutch, had as
yet found out the proper remedy. As rigour and re|&s;traint
had failed in Scotland, a &s;cheme of <HI>comprehen&s;ion</HI>
was tried; by which it was propo&s;ed to dimini&s;h greatly
the authority of bi&s;hops, to aboli&s;h their negative voice
in the eccle&s;ia&s;tical courts, and to leave them little more
than the right of precedency among the pre&s;byters. But
the zealots entertained great jealou&s;y again&s;t this &s;cheme,
They remembered, that it was by &s;uch gradual &s;teps,
<PB N="47" REF="59">
that King James endeavoured to introduce epi&s;copacy.
Should the ears and eyes of men be once reconciled to the
name and habit of bi&s;hops, the whole power of the func|tion,
they dreaded, would &s;oon follow: The lea&s;t com|munication
with unlawful and antichri&s;tian in&s;titutions
they e&s;teemed dangerous and criminal: <HI>Touch not, ta&s;te
not, handle not;</HI> this cry went out among&s;t them: And
the King's mini&s;ters at la&s;t perceived that they &s;hould
pro&s;titute the dignity of government, by making ad|vances,
to which the malecontents were determined not
not to corre&s;pond.</P>
<P>THE next project adopted was that of <HI>indulgence.</HI> In
pro&s;ecution of this &s;cheme, the mo&s;t popular of the ex|pelled
preachers, without requiring any terms of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion, were &s;ettled in vacant
churches; and &s;mall &s;alaries of about twenty pounds a
year were offered to the re&s;t, till they &s;hould otherwi&s;e be
provided for. The&s;e la&s;t refu&s;ed the King's bounty,
which they con&s;idered as the wages of a criminal &s;ilence.
Even the former &s;oon repented their compliance. The
people, who had been accu&s;tomed to hear them rail
again&s;t their &s;uperiors, and preach to the times, as they
called it, deemed their &s;ermons languid and &s;piritle&s;s,
when deprived of the&s;e ornaments. Their u&s;ual gifts,
they thought, had left them, on account of their &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,
which was &s;tigmatized as era&s;tiani&s;m. They
gave them the appellation, not of mini&s;ters of Chri&s;t, but
of <HI>the King's curates;</HI> as the clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed
church were commonly denominated the <HI>bi&s;hops cutates.</HI>
The preachers them&s;elves returned in a little time to
their former practices, by which they hoped to regain
their former dominion over the minds of men; a &s;upe|riority,
which no one, who has ever po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed it, will
willingly, by any con&s;ideration, be prevailed on to re|linqui&s;h.
The conventicles, multiplied daily in the We&s;t:
The clergy of the e&s;tabli&s;hed church were in&s;ulted:
<PB N="48" REF="60">
The laws were neglected: The Covenanters even met
daily in arms at their places of wor&s;hip: And though
they u&s;ually di&s;per&s;ed them&s;elves after religious &s;ervice,
yet the government took a ju&s;t alarm at &s;eeing men,
who were &s;o entirely governed by their &s;editious teachers;
dare to &s;et authority at defiance, and during a time of
full peace, to put them&s;elves in a military po&s;ture.</P>
<P>THERE was here, it is apparent, in the political body,
a di&s;ea&s;e very dangerous and inveterate; and the govern|ment
had tried every remedy, but the true one, to allay
and correct it. An unlimited toleration, after &s;ects have
diffu&s;ed them&s;elves and are &s;trongly rooted, is the only
expedient, which can allay their fervour, and make the
civil union acquire a &s;uperiority above religious di&s;tinc|tions.
But as the operations of this regimen are com|monly
very gradual, and at fir&s;t imperceptible, vulgar
politicians are apt, for that rea&s;on, to have recour&s;e to
more ha&s;ty and more dangerous remedies. It is ob&s;erv|able
too, that the&s;e non-conformi&s;ts in Scotland neither
offered nor demanded toleration; but laid claim to an
entire &s;uperiority, and to the exerci&s;e of extreme rigour
again&s;t their adver&s;aries. The covenant, which they ido|lized,
was a per&s;ecuting, as well as a &s;editious band of
confederacy: and the government, in&s;tead of treating
them like madmen, who &s;hould be &s;oothed, and flatter|ed,
and deceived into tranquillity, thought them&s;elves in|titled
to a rigid obedience, and were too apt, from a mi&s;|taken
policy, to retaliate upon the di&s;&s;enters, who had
erred from the &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;m.</P>
<P>Amid&s;t the&s;e di&s;turbances, a new parliament was a&s;&s;em|bled
at Edinburgh<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">19th of October, 1669.</NOTE>; and Lauderdale was &s;ent down com|mi&s;&s;ioner.
The zealous pre&s;byterians, who were the
chief patrons of liberty, were too obnoxious to re&s;i&s;t the
mea&s;ures of the government; and the tyde &s;till ran
&s;trong in favour of monarchy. The commi&s;&s;ioner had
<PB N="49" REF="61">
&s;uch influence as to get two acts pa&s;&s;ed, which were of
the utmo&s;t con&s;equence to the civil and ecc&s;e&s;ia&s;tical li|berties
of the kingdom. By the one, it was declared,
that the &s;ettling all things with regard to the external
government of the church was a right of the crown:
That whatever related to eccle&s;ia&s;tical meetings, mat|ters,
and per&s;ons, were to be ordered, according to &s;uch
directions as the King &s;hould &s;end to his Privy Council:
And that the&s;e, being publi&s;hed by them, &s;hould have
the force of laws. The other act regarded the militia,
which the King by his own authority had two years be|fore
e&s;tabli&s;hed, In place of the army which was broke.
By this act, the militia was &s;ettled to the number of
22000 men, who were to be con&s;tantly armed, and re|gularly
di&s;ciplined. And it was farther enacted, that
the&s;e troops &s;hould be held in readine&s;s to march into
England, Ireland, or any part of the King's dominions,
for any cau&s;e in which his Maje&s;ty's authority, power,
for greatne&s;s was concerned; on receiving orders not
from the King, but the Privy Council of Scotland.</P>
<P>LAUDERDALE boa&s;ted extremely of his &s;ervices in
procuring the&s;e two laws: The King by the former
was rendered ab&s;olute ma&s;ter of the church, and might
legally, even by an edict, re-e&s;tabli&s;h, if he thought pro|per,
the Catholic religion in Scotland: By the latter,
he &s;aw a powerful force ready at his call: He had even
the advantage of being able to di&s;gui&s;e his orders under the name of the Privy Council; and in ca&s;e of failure
in his enterprises, could, by &s;uch a pretence, apologize
for his Conduct to the Engli&s;h parliament. But <HI>in</HI> pro|portion
as the&s;e laws were agreeable to the King, they
gave alarm to the Engli&s;h Commons, and were the chief
cau&s;e of tho&s;e redoubled attacks, which they made upon
Lauderdale. the&s;e attacks, however, &s;erved only to for|tify
him in his intere&s;t with the King; and tho' it is pro|bable,
that the Scots militia, during the divided &s;tate of

<PB N="50" REF="64">
that kingdom, would, if matters had come to extremity,
have been of very little &s;ervice again&s;t England; yet
did $word$ regard the credit of it as a con&s;iderable &s;up|port
to his authority: And Lauderdale, by degrees, be|came
the prime or rather &s;ole mini&s;ter for Scotland.
The natural indolence of the King di&s;po&s;ed him to give
entire confidence to a man, who had &s;o far extended the
royal Prerogative, and who was &s;till di&s;po&s;ed to render
it ab&s;olutely uncontroulable.</P>
<P>IN a &s;ub&s;equent &s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;ame Parliament<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">28th of July, 1670.</NOTE>, a
&s;evere law was enacted again&s;t conventicles. Ruinous
fines were impo&s;ed both on the preachers and hearers,
even if the meetings had been in hou&s;es; but field con|venticles
were &s;ubjected to the penalty of death and con|fi&s;cation
of goods: Four hundred marks Scots were
offered as a reward to tho&s;e who &s;hould &s;eize the crimi|nals;
and they were indemnified for any &s;laughter,
which they &s;hould commit in the execution of &s;uch an
undertaking. And as it was found difficult to get evi|dence
again&s;t the&s;e conventicles, however numerous,
it was enacted by another law, that, whoever, being
required by the Council, refu&s;ed to give information
upon oath,, &s;hould be puni&s;hed by arbitrary fines, by
impri&s;onment, or by bani&s;hment to the plantations.
Thus all per&s;ecution naturally, or rather nece&s;&s;arily,
adopts the iniquities, as well as rigors, of the inqui&s;i|tion.
What a con&s;iderable part of the &s;ociety con&s;ider
as their duty and honour, and the others are apt to re|gard
with compa&s;&s;ion and indulgence, can by no other
expedient be &s;ubjected to &s;uch &s;evere penalties as the na|tural
&s;entiments of mankind appropriate only to the
greate&s;t crimes.</P>
<P>THO' Lauderdale found this ready compliance in the
Parliament, a party was formed again&s;t him, of which
duke Hamilton was the head, Next &s;e&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="&dagger;" PLACE="foot">16th of June, 1673.</NOTE>, this party
<PB N="51" REF="65">
had become considerable: And many were di&s;gu&s;ted,
as well with Lauderdale's in&s;olence, as with the
grievances, under which the nation laboured. The fir&s;t
Parliament of this reign had acknowleged, that the
regulation of all foreign trade was an inherent branch
of royal prerogative. In con&s;equence of this impor|tant
conce&s;&s;ion, the King, by an act of council, had
prohibited the importation of brandy and all &s;pirits; and
the execution of this edict was committed to lord El|phin&s;tone,
a relation of Lauderdale's. Elphin&s;tone
made no other u&s;e of this power than to &s;ell licences to
the merchants, by which expedient he gained great &s;ums
to him&s;elf, tho' to the lo&s;s of the revenue, as well as of
the kingdom. A monopoly of &s;alt had al&s;o been
granted to lord Kincardine; and a new impo&s;ition on
tobacco had been be&s;towed in gift upon Sir John Ni|col&s;on,
for the benefit of him&s;elf and &s;ome friends of
Lauderdale. When the&s;e grievances were complained
of, the commi&s;&s;ioner, who was de&s;irous to prevent all
parliamentary enquiry, cho&s;e rather to redre&s;s them in
council; and he accordingly cancelled the three patents
complained of. But as farther grievances were men|tioned,
and a general repre&s;entation of the &s;tate of
the kingdom was propo&s;ed to be made by Parliament:
Lauderdale oppo&s;ed, as a barrier, the Lords of Articles,
without who&s;e con&s;ent, he &s;aid, no motion could be re|ceived.
Men were now convinced of their imprudence
in re&s;toring that in&s;titution, which rendered all national
a&s;&s;emblies in a manner u&s;ele&s;s for the redre&s;s of grie|vances.</P>
<P>HAMILTON, Tweddale, and others went to London,
and applied to the King, who was alone able to correct
the abu&s;es of Lauderdale's admini&s;tration. But even
their complaints to him might be dangerous; and all
approaches of truth to the Throne were barred by the
ridiculous law again&s;t lea&s;ing-making; a law, which &s;eems
<PB N="52" REF="66">
have been extorted by the antient nobles, in order to
protect their own tyranny, oppre&s;&s;ion, and inju&s;tice. Great
precautions, therefore, were u&s;ed by the Scots malecon|tents
in their repre&s;entations to the King; but no redre&s;s
was obtained. Charles loaded them with care&s;&s;es, and
continued Lauderdale in his authority.</P>
<P>A VERY bad, at lea&s;t a &s;evere u&s;e was made of this au|thority.
The Privy Council di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed twelve gentle|men
or noblemen of their hou&s;es<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">In 1675.</NOTE>; and the&s;e hou&s;es
were converted, into &s;o many garri&s;ons, e&s;tabli&s;hed for
the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of conventicles. The nation, it was
pretended, was really, on account of the&s;e religious a&s;|&s;emblies,
in a &s;tate of war; and by the antient law, the
King, in &s;uch an emergence, was empowered to place a
garri&s;on in any hou&s;e, where he &s;hould judge it ex|pedient.</P>
<P>IT were endle&s;s to recount every act of violence and ar|bitrary
authority exerci&s;ed during Lauderdale's admini&s;|tration.
All the lawyers were put from the bar, nay,
bani&s;hed by the King's order twelve miles from Edin|burgh,
and by that means the whole ju&s;tice of the king|dom
was &s;u&s;pended for a year; till the&s;e lawyers were
brought to declare it as their opinion, that all appeals to
Parliament were illegal. A letter was procured from
the King, for turning out twelve of the chief magi&s;|trates
of Edinburgh, and declaring them incapable of
all public office; tho' their only crime had been their
want of compliance with Lauderdale. The burroughs
of Scotland have a privilege of meeting once a year by
their deputies, in order to con&s;ider the &s;tate of trade,
and make bye-laws for its regulation: In this conven|tion
a petition was voted, complaining of &s;ome late laws,
which ob&s;tructed commerce, and praying the King, that
he would impower his commi&s;&s;ioner, in the next &s;e&s;&s;ion of
Parliament, to give his a&s;&s;ent to the repealing them. For
<PB N="53" REF="67">
this pre&s;umption, as it was called, &s;everal of the members
were fined and impri&s;oned. One More, a member of
Parliament, having moved in the hou&s;e, that, in imi|tation
of the Engli&s;h Parliament, no bill&punc; &s;hould pa&s;s
except after three readings, he was for this pretended
offence immediately &s;ent to pri&s;on by the commi&s;&s;ioner&punc;</P>
<P>THE private deportment of Lauderdale was as in&s;olent
and provoking as his public admini&s;tration was violent
and tyrannical. Ju&s;tice likewi&s;e was univer&s;ally per|verted
by faction and intere&s;t: And from the great ra|pacity
of that duke, and &s;till more of his dutche&s;s, all
offices and favours were openly put to &s;ale. No-one
was allowed to approach the Throne who was not de|pendant
on him; and no remedy could be hoped for or
obtained again&s;t his manifold oppre&s;&s;ions. The ca&s;e of
Mitchel &s;hows, that this minti&s;ter was as much devoid
of truth and honour as of lenity and ju&s;tice.</P>
<P>MITCHEL was a de&s;perate $anatic, and had entertained&punc;
a re&s;olution of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating Sharpe, archbi&s;hop of St.
Andrews, who, by his former apo&s;tacy and &s;ub&s;equent
rigour, had rendered him&s;elf extremely odious to all men,
e&s;pecially to the Covenanters. In the year 1668,
Mitchel fired a pi&s;tol at the primate, as he was &s;itting in
his coach; but the bi&s;hop of Orkney, &s;tepping into the
coach, happened to &s;tretch out his arm, which intercepted
the ball, and was much &s;hattered by it. This happened
in the principal &s;treet of the city; but &s;o generally was
the archbi&s;hop dete&s;ted, that the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in was allowed peace|ably
to walk off; and having turned a &s;treet or two,
and thrown off a wig, which di&s;gui&s;ed him, he imme|diately
appeared in public, and remained altogether un|&s;u&s;pected.
Some years afterwards, Sharpe remarked a
man, who &s;eemed to eye him very eagerly; and being
&s;till anxious, le&s;t an attempt of a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination &s;hould be
renewed, he ordered him to be &s;eized and examined.
Two loaded pi&s;tols were found upon him; and as he
<PB N="54" REF="68">
was now concluded to be the author of the former at|tempt,
Sharpe promi&s;ed, that if he would confe&s;s his
guilt, he &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed without any puni&s;hment.
Mitchel was &s;o credulous as to believe him; but was
immediately produced before the council by the faithle&s;s
primate. The council, having no proof again&s;t him,
but hoping to involve the whole body of Cove|nanters
in this odious crime, very &s;olemnly renewed
the promi&s;e of pardon, if he would make a full di&s;co|very;
and it was a great di&s;appointment to them, when
they found, upon his confe&s;&s;ion, that only one per&s;on,
who was now dead, had been acquainted with his bloody
resolutions. Mitchel was next carried before a court of
judicature, and required to renew his confe&s;&s;ion; but be|ing
apprehen&s;ive, that, tho' a pardon for life had been
promi&s;ed him, other corporal puni&s;hments might &s;till be
inflicted, he refu&s;ed compliance; and was &s;ent back to
pri&s;on. He was next examined before the council, un|der
pretence of his being concerned in the in&s;urrection
at Pentland; and tho' no proof appeared again&s;t him,
he was put to the que&s;tion, and contrary to the mo&s;t ob|vious
principles of equity, was urged to accu&s;e him&s;elf.
He endured the torture with &s;ingular re&s;olution, and
continued ob&s;tinate in the denial of a crime, of which,
it is believed, he really was not guilty. In&s;tead of ob|taining
his liberty, he was &s;ent to the Ba&s;s, a very high
rock, &s;urrounded by the &s;ea; at this time converted into\
a &s;tate pri&s;on, and full of the unhappy Covenanters.
He there remained in great mi&s;ery, loaded with irons;
till the year 1677, when it was re&s;olved by &s;ome new
examples to &s;trike a fre&s;h terror into the per&s;ecuted, but
&s;till ob&s;tinate enthu&s;ia&s;ts&punc; Mitchel was then brought
before a court of judicature, and put upon his trial, for
an attempt to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate an archbi&s;hop and a privy coun|&s;ellor.
His former confe&s;&s;ion was pleaded again&s;t him,
and was proved by the te&s;timony of the duke of Lauder|dales
<PB N="55" REF="69">
lord commi&s;&s;ioner, lord Hatton his brother, de|puty
trea&s;urer, the earl of Rothes, chancellor, and the
primate him&s;elf. Mitchel, be&s;ides maintaining that the
Privy Council was no court of judicature, and that a
confe&s;&s;ion before them was not judicial, a&s;&s;erted, that
he had been engaged to make that confe&s;&s;ion by a &s;o|lemn
promi&s;e of pardon which had been given him.
The four privy coun&s;ellors denied upon oath, that any
&s;uch promi&s;e had ever been given. The pri&s;oner then
de&s;ired, that the council books might be produced in
court; and even offered a copy of that day's proceedings
to be read; but the Privy Coun&s;ellors maintained, that,
after they had made oath, no farther proof could be ad|mitted,
and that the books of Privy Council contained
the King's &s;ecrets, which were on no account to be di|vulged.
They were not probably aware, when they
&s;wore, that the clerk having engro&s;&s;ed the promi&s;e of
pardon in the narrative of Mitchel's confe&s;&s;ion, the
whole minute had been &s;igned by the chancellor, and
that the proofs of their perjury were by that means
committed to record. Tho' the pri&s;oner was condemned,
Lauderdale was &s;till inclined to pardon him; but the un|relenting
primate rigorou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted upon his execution,
and &s;aid, that, if a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins remained unpuni&s;hed, his life
mu&s;t be expo&s;ed to perpetual danger. Mitchel was ac|cordingly
executed at Edinburgh in January 1678.
Such a complication of cruelty and treachery &s;hews the
character of tho&s;e mini&s;ters, to whom the King had
entru&s;ted the government of Scotland.</P>
<P>LAUDERDALE'S admini&s;tration, be&s;ides the iniquities
ari&s;ing from the extreme violence of his temper, and
the &s;till greater iniquities in&s;eparable from all projects
of per&s;ecution, was attended with other circum&s;tances,
which engaged him into &s;evere and arbitrary mea&s;ures.
An ab&s;olute government was to be introduced, which on
its commencement is often mo&s;t rigorous; and tyranny
<PB N="56" REF="70">
was &s;till obliged, for want of military power, to cover
it&s;elf under an appearance of law; a &s;ituation which&punc;
rendered it extremely awkward in its motions, and by
provoking oppo&s;ition, extended the fury of its op|pre&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE rigours, exerci&s;ed again&s;t conventicles, in&s;tead
of breaking the &s;pirit of the fanatics, had tended only,
its is u&s;ual, to render them more ob&s;tinate in their errors,
to increa&s;e the fervour of their zeal, to link them more
clo&s;ely with each other, and to enflame them again&s;t
the e&s;tablished hierarchy. The Commonalty, almo&s;t
every where in the South, particularly in the We&s;tern counties, frequented conventicles without re&s;erve; and
the gentry, tho' they them&s;elves commonly ab&s;tained
from the&s;e illegal places of wor&s;hip, connived at this ir|regularity
in their inferiors. In order to engage the for|mer
on the &s;ide of the per&s;ecutors, a bond or contract
was by order of the Privy Council tendered to the land|lords
in the We&s;t, by which they were to engage for
the good behaviour of their tenants; and in ca&s;e any te|nant
frequented a conventicle, they were to &s;ubject
them&s;elves to the &s;ame fine as could by law be exacted
from the delinquent. It was ridiculous to give &s;anction
to laws by voluntary contracts: It was iniquitous to make
one man an&s;werable for another's conduct: It was ille|gal
to impo&s;e &s;uch hard conditions upon men&punc; who had
no wi&s;e offended. For the&s;e rea&s;ons, the greate&s;t part
of the gentry refu&s;ed to &s;ign tho&s;e bonds; and Lauder|dale,
enraged at this oppo&s;ition, endeavoured to break
their &s;pirit by expedients, which were &s;till more unu&s;ual
and more arbitrary.</P>
<P>THE law enacted again&s;t conventicles, had called
them &s;eminaries of rebellion. This expre&s;&s;ion, which
was nothing but a flouri&s;h of rhetoric, Lauderdale and
the Privy Council were willing to under&s;tand in a literal
&s;en&s;e: and becau&s;e the we&s;tern counties abounded in con|venticles,
<PB N="57" REF="71">
tho' otherwi&s;e in the mo&s;t profound peace,
they pretended, that the&s;e counties were in a &s;tate of ac|tual
war and rebellion. They made therefore an agree|ment
with &s;ome highland chieftains to call out their clans
to the number of 8000 men: to the&s;e they joined the
guards, and the militia of Angus: And they &s;ent the
whole to live on free quarter upon the lands of &s;uch as
had refu&s;ed the bonds illegally required of them. The
obnoxious counties were the mo&s;t populous and mo&s;t in|du&s;trious in Scotland: The highlanders were the peo|ple
the mo&s;t di&s;orderly and the lea&s;t civilized. It Is ea&s;y
to imagine the havoc and de&s;truction, which en&s;ued.
A multitude, not accu&s;tomed to military discipline,
aver&s;e to the re&s;traint of laws, trained up in rapine and
violence, were let loo&s;e amid&s;t tho&s;e whom they were
taught to regard as enemies to their Prince and to their
religion. Nothing e&s;caped their ravenous hands: By
hard&s;hips, and &s;ometimes by tortures, men were obliged
to di&s;cover their concealed wealth. Neither age, nor
&s;ex, nor innocence afforded protection: And the gentry,
finding that even tho&s;e who had been mo&s;t compliant,
and who had &s;ub&s;cribed the bonds, were alike expo&s;ed
to the rapacity of tho&s;e barbarians, confirmed them&s;elves
&s;till more in the ob&s;tinate re&s;olution of refu&s;ing them.
The voice of the nation was rai&s;ed again&s;t this enor|mous
outrage; and after two months free quarter, the
highlanders were at la&s;t &s;ent back to their hills, loaded
with the &s;poils and execrations, of the We&s;t.</P>
<P>THOSE who had been engaged to &s;ub&s;cribe the bonds,
could find no &s;ecurity but by turning out &s;uch tenants
as they &s;u&s;pected of an inclination to conventicles, and
thereby depopulating their e&s;tates. To encrea&s;e the mi|&s;ery
of the&s;e unhappy tenants the council enacted, that
none &s;hould be received any where, or allowed a habi|tation,
who brought not a certificate of his conformity
from the pari&s;h-mini&s;ter. That the ob&s;tinate and re|fractory
<PB N="58" REF="72">
might not e&s;cape farther per&s;ecution, a new de|vice
was fallen upon. By the law of Scotland, any man,
who &s;hould go before a magi&s;trate, and &s;wear that he
thought him&s;elf in danger from another, might obtain a
writ of <HI>law-burrows,</HI> as it is called; by which the lat|ter
was bound,, under the penalty of impri&s;onment and outlawry,
to find &s;ecurity for his good behaviour. Lau|derdale
entertained, the ab&s;urd notion of making the
King &s;ue for writs of law-burrows again&s;t his &s;ubjects.
On this pretence, the refu&s;ers of the bonds were &s;um|moned
to appear before the council, and were required
to bind them&s;elves, under the penalty of two years rent,
neither to frequent conventicles them&s;elves, nor allow
their family and tenants to be pre&s;ent at tho&s;e unlawful
a&s;&s;emblies. Thus chicanery was joined to tyranny; and
the Maje&s;ty of the King, in&s;tead of being exalted, was
an reality pro&s;tituted; as if he were obliged to &s;eek the
&s;ame &s;ecurity, which one neighbour might require of
another.</P>
<P>IT was an old law, but &s;eldom executed, that a man,
who was accu&s;ed of any crime, and did not appear, in
order to take his trial, might be <HI>intercommuned,</HI> that is,
he might be publicly outlawed; and whoever afterwards,
either on account of bu&s;ine&s;s, relation, nay charity,
had the lea&s;t intercour&s;e with him, was &s;ubjected to the
&s;ame penalties as could by law be inflicted on the cri|minal
him&s;elf. A great many writs of intercommuning
were now i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the hearers and preachers in
conventicles; and by this &s;evere and even ab&s;urd law,
crimes and guilt went on multiplying in a geometrical
proportion. Where laws them&s;elves are &s;o violent, it
is no wonder that an admini&s;tration &s;hould be ty|rannical.</P>
<P>LEST the cry of an oppre&s;&s;ed people &s;hould reach the
Throne, the council forbad, under high penalties, every
nobleman or gentleman of landed property to leave the
<PB N="59" REF="73">
kingdom. A &s;evere edict, e&s;pecially where the Sovereign
him&s;elf re&s;ided in a foreign country. Notwith&s;tanding
this act of council, Ca&s;&s;ilis fir&s;t, afterwards Hamilton
and Tweddale, went to London, and laid their com|plaints
before the King. The&s;e violent proceedings of
Lauderdale were very oppo&s;ite to the natural temper of
Charles; and he immediately i&s;&s;ued orders for di&s;conti|nuing
the bonds and the writs of law-burrows. But as
he was commonly little touched with what lay at a di&s;|tance,
he entertained not the proper indignation again&s;t
tho&s;e who had abu&s;ed his authority. Even while he re|tracted
the&s;e oppre&s;&s;ive mea&s;ures, he was prevailed with
to avow and prai&s;e them in a letter, which he wrote to
the privy council. This proof of confidence might for|tify
the hands of the mini&s;try, but the King ran a ma|nife&s;t
hazard of lo&s;ing the affections of his &s;ubjects, by
not permitting even tho&s;e who were de&s;irous of it, to
di&s;tingui&s;h between him and their oppre&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>IT is reported<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Burnet.</NOTE>, that Charles, after a full hearing of
the debates concerning Scots affairs, &s;aid, &startq; I perceive
that Lauderdale has been guilty of many bad things,
again&s;t the people of Scotland; but I cannot find,
that he has acted any thing contrary to my intere&s;t.&endq;
A &s;entiment mo&s;t unworthy of a Sovereign!</P>
<P>DURING the ab&s;ence of Hamilton and the other di&s;|contented
Lords, the King allowed Lauderdale to &s;um|mon
a convention of e&s;tates at Edinburgh. This con|vention,
be&s;ides granting &s;ome money, be&s;towed ap|plau&s;es
on all Lauderdale's admini&s;tration, and in their
addre&s;&s;es to the King, expre&s;&s;ed the highe&s;t contentment
and &s;atisfaction. But the&s;e in&s;tances of complai&s;ance
had the contrary effect in England from what was ex|pected
by the contrivers of them. All men there con|cluded
that in Scotland the very voice of liberty was to|tally

&s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and that, by the prevalence of tyranny,
grievances were &s;o rivetted, that it was become dange|rous
even to mention them, or complain to the Prince,
who alone was capable of redre&s;&s;ing them. From the
&s;lavery of the neighbouring kingdom, they inferred the
arbitrary di&s;po&s;itions of the King; and from the violence,
with which &s;overeign power was there exerci&s;ed, they
apprehended the mi&s;eries, which might en&s;ue to them|&s;elves
upon their lo&s;s of liberty. If per&s;ecution by a
prote&s;tant church could be carried to &s;uch extremities,
what might be dreaded from the prevalence of popery,
which had ever, in all ages, made open profe&s;&s;ion of
exterminating by fire and &s;word every oppo&s;ite &s;ect or
communion? And if the fir&s;t approaches towards un|limited
authority were &s;o tyrannical, how di&s;mal its
final e&s;tabli&s;hment; when all dread of oppo&s;ition &s;hall
at la&s;t be removed by mercenary armies, and all &s;en&s;e
of &s;hame by long and inveterate habit?</P>

<P>THE Engli&s;h nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">CHAP. LXVII.</NOTE> ever &s;ince the fatal league with
France, had entertained violent jealou&s;ies again&s;t
the Court; and the &s;ub&s;equent mea&s;ures adopted by the
King, had tended more to encrea&s;e than cure the gene|ral
prejudices. Some my&s;terious de&s;ign was &s;till &s;u&s;|pected
in every enterprize and profe&s;&s;ion: Arbitrary
power and popery were apprehended as the &s;cope of all
projects: Each breath or rumour made the people &s;tart
with anxiety: Their enemies, they thought, were in
their very bo&s;om, and had got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of their Sove|reign's
confidence. While in this timorous, jealous di&s;|po&s;ition,

ears: They were wakened from their &s;lumber; and like
men affrighted and in the dark, took every &s;hadow for
a &s;pecter. The terror of each man became the &s;ource of
terror to another. And an univer&s;al panic being diffu|&s;ed,
rea&s;on and argument and common &s;en&s;e and com|mon
humanity lo&s;t all influence over them. From this
di&s;po&s;ition of men's minds we are to account for the pro|gre&s;s
and credit of the POPISH PLOT;<NOTE PLACE="marg">The popi&s;h plot.</NOTE> an event, which
would otherwi&s;e appear prodigious and altogether inex|plicable.</P>
<P>ON the twelfth of Augu&s;t, one Kirby, a chemi&s;t, ac|co&s;ted
the Kang, as he was walking in the Park: &startq; Sir,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq; keep within the company: Your enemies
have a de&s;ign upon your life; and you may be &s;hot
in this very walk.&endq; Being a&s;ked the rea&s;on of the&s;e
&s;trange &s;peeches, he &s;aid, that two men, called Grove
and Pickering, had engaged to &s;hoot the King, and Sir
George Wakeman, the Queen's phy&s;ician, to poy&s;on
him. This intelligence, he added, had been commun|nicated
to him by Doctor Tongue; whom, if per|mitted,
he would introduce to his Maje&s;ty. Tongue
was a divine of the church of England; a man active,
re&s;tle&s;s, full of projects, devoid of under&s;tanding.
He brought papers to the King, which contained informa|tion
of a plot, and were dige&s;ted into forty-three articles.
The King not having lei&s;ure to peru&s;e them, &s;ent them
to the lord-trea&s;urer, Danby, and ordered the two in|formers
to lay the bu&s;ine&s;s before that mini&s;ter. Tongue
confe&s;&s;ed to Danby, that he him&s;elf had not drawn the
papers, that they had been &s;ecretly thru&s;t under his door,
and that, tho' he &s;u&s;pected, he did not certainly know
who was the author. After a few days, he returned,
and told the trea&s;urer, that his &s;u&s;picions, he found,
were ju&s;t; that the author of the intelligence, whom
he had met twice or thrice in the &s;treet, had acknow|leged
the whole matter, and had given him a more par|ticular
<PB N="63" REF="81">
account of the con&s;piracy, but de&s;ired, that his
name might be concealed, being apprehen&s;ive le&s;t the
papi&s;ts &s;hould murder him.</P>
<P>THE information was renewed with regard to Grove's
and Pickering's intentions of &s;hooting the King; and
Tongue even pretended, that, at a particular time, they
were to &s;et out for Wind&s;or with that intention. Or|ders
were given for arre&s;ting them, &s;o &s;oon as they
&s;hould appear in that place: But tho' this alarm was
more than once renewed, &s;ome frivolous rea&s;ons were
&s;till found by Tongue for their delaying the journey.
And the King concluded, both from, the&s;e eva&s;ions, and
from the my&s;terious, artificial manner of communicating
the intelligence, that the whole was a fiction.</P>
<P>TONGUE came next to the trea&s;urer, and told him,
that a pacquet of letters, wrote by je&s;uits concerned in
the plot, was that night to be put into the po&s;t-hou&s;e
for Wind&s;or, directed to Bedingfield, a je&s;uit, confe&s;&s;or
to the Duke. When this intelligence was conveyed to
the King, he replied, that the pacquet mentioned had a
few hours before been brought to the Duke by Beding|field;
who &s;aid, that he &s;u&s;pected &s;ome bad de&s;ign upon
him, that the letters &s;eemed to contain matters of a dan|gerous
import, and that he knew them not to be the hand|writing
of the per&s;ons who&s;e names were &s;ub&s;cribed to
them. This incident &s;till farther confirmed the King in
his incredulity.</P>
<P>THE matter had probably &s;lept in this po&s;ture for ever, had it not been for the anxiety of the Duke, who, hearing
that prie&s;ts and je&s;uits and even his own confe&s;&s;or had
been accu&s;ed, was de&s;irous, that a thorough, enquiry
&s;hould by made by the council into the pretended con|&s;piracy.
Kirby and Tongue were enquired after, and
were now found to be living in clo&s;e conjunction with
Titus Oates, the per&s;on who was &s;aid to have conveyed
the fir&s;t intelligence to Tongue. Oates affirmed, that

he had fallen under &s;u&s;picion with the je&s;uits; that he
had received three blows with a &s;tick and a box on the
ear from the provincial of that order, for revealing their
con&s;piracy: and that over-hearing them &s;peak of their
intentions to puni&s;h him more &s;everely, he had with|drawn,
and concealed him&s;elf. This man, in who&s;e
brea&s;t was lodged a &s;ecret, involving the fate of Kings
and kingdoms, was allowed to remain in &s;uch nece&s;&s;ity,
that Kirby was obliged to &s;upply him with daily bread;
and it was a joyful &s;urprize to him, when he heard, that
the council were at la&s;t di&s;po&s;ed to take &s;ome notice of
his intelligence. But as he expected more encourage|ment
from the public, than from the King or his mini|&s;ters,
he thought proper, before he was pre&s;ented to the
council, to go with his two companions to Sir Edmund&s;|bury
Godfrey, a noted and active ju&s;tice of peace, and
to give evidence before him of all the articles of the
con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>THE wonderful intelligence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">oates's narrative.</NOTE> which Oates conveyed
both to Godfrey and the council, and afterwards to the
Parliament, was to this purpo&s;e<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Oates's Narrative.</NOTE>. The pope, he &s;aid,
on examining the matter in the congregation <HI>de propa|ganda
fide,</HI> had found him&s;elf entitled to the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
England and Ireland on account of the here&s;y of Prince
and people, and had accordingly a&s;&s;umed the &s;overeignty
of the&s;e kingdoms. This &s;upreme power he had thought
proper to delegate to the &s;ociety* of je&s;uits; and de
Oliva, general of that order, in con&s;equence of the pa|pal
grant, had exerted every act of regal authority, and
particularly had &s;upplied, by commi&s;&s;ions under the &s;eal
of the &s;ociety, all the chief offices, both civil and mili|tary.
Lord Arundel was created chancellor, lord Powis
trea&s;urer, Sir William Godolphin privy &s;eal, Coleman
&s;ecretary of &s;tate, Langhorne attorney general, lord Bel|la&s;is general of the papal army, lord Peters lieutenant
<PB N="65" REF="85">
general, lord Stafford pay-ma&s;ter; and inferior com|mi&s;&s;ions, &s;igned by the provincial of the je&s;uits, were
al&s;o di&s;tributed to men of all ranks. All the digni|ties
of the church were filled, and many of them
with Spaniards and other foreigners. The provincial
had held a con&s;ult of the je&s;uits under his authority;
where the King, whom they opprobriou&s;ly called the
Black Ba&s;tard, was &s;olemnly tried and condemned as
a heretic; and a re&s;olution taken to put him to death.
Father le Shee (for &s;o this great plotter and informer
called father la Chai&s;e, confe&s;&s;or to the French King, a
man of probity and humanity) had con&s;igned in London
ten thou&s;and pounds to be paid to any man, who &s;hould
merit it by this a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination. A Spani&s;h provincial had
expre&s;&s;ed like liberality: The prior of the Benedictines
was willing to go the length of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds:
The Dominicans approved of the action; but pleaded
poverty. Ten thou&s;and pounds had been offered to Sir
George Wakeman, the Queen's phy&s;ician, who de|manded
fifteen thou&s;and, as a reward for &s;o great a &s;er|vice:
His demand was complied with; and five thou|&s;and
had been paid him by advance. Le&s;t this means
&s;hould fail, four Iri&s;h ruffians had been employed by the
je&s;uits, at the rate of twenty guineas a-piece, to &s;tab the
King at Wind&s;or; and Coleman, late &s;ecretary to the
Dutche&s;s of York, had given the me&s;&s;enger, who car|ried
them orders, a guinea to quicken his diligence.
Grove and Pickering were al&s;o employed to &s;hoot the
King with &s;ilver bullets: The former was to receive the
&s;um of fifteen hundred pounds; the latter, being a pious
man, was to be rewarded with thirty thou&s;and ma&s;&s;es,
which, e&s;timating ma&s;&s;es at a &s;hilling a-piece, amounted
to a like value. Pickering would have executed his pur|po&s;e,
had not the f$int at one time dropt out of his pi&s;tol,
at another time the priming. Coniers, the je&s;uit, had
bought a knife at the price of ten &s;hiliings, which, he
<PB N="66" REF="86">
thought, was not dear, con&s;idering the purpo&s;e for which
he inten ded it, to wit, &s;tabbing the King. Letters of
&s;ub&s;cription were circulated among the catholics all over
England, to rai&s;e a &s;um for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. No le&s;s
than fifty je&s;uits had met in May la&s;t, at the White-hor&s;e
tavern, where it was unanimou&s;ly agreed to put the King
to death. This &s;ynod did afterwards, for more conve|nience,
divide them&s;elves into many le&s;s cabals or com|panies;
and Oates was employed to carry notes and let|ters
from one to another, all tending to the &s;ame end of
murthering the King. He even carried, from one com|pany
to another, a paper, in which they formally expre&s;|&s;ed
their re&s;olution of executing that deed; and it was regu|larly
&s;ub&s;cribed by all of them. A wager of an hundred
pounds was laid, and &s;takes made, that the King &s;hould
eat no more Chri&s;tmas pyes. In &s;hort, it was deter|mined,
to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of a je&s;uit, that if he would
not become R. C. (Roman Catholic) he &s;hould no lon|ger
be C. R. (Charles rex). The great fire of London
had been the work of the je&s;uits, who had employed eighty
or eighty-&s;ix per&s;ons for that purpo&s;e, and had expended
&s;even hundred fire-balls; but they had a good return for
their charges; for they had been able to pilfer goods
from the fire to the value of fourteen thou&s;and
pounds: The je&s;uits had al&s;o rai&s;ed another fire on St.
Margaret's Hill, whence they had &s;tolen goods to the
value of two thou&s;and pounds: Another at Southwark:
and it was determined in like manner to burn all the
chief cities in England. A paper model was already
framed for the firing of London; the &s;tations were re|gularly
marked out, where the &s;everal fires were to com|mence;
and the whole plan of operations was &s;o con|certed,
that precautions were taken by the je&s;uits to
vary their mea&s;ures, according to the variations of the
winds. Fire-balls were familiarly called among then
Teuxbury mu&s;tard pills; and were &s;aid to contain$$
<PB N="67" REF="87">
notable biting &s;auce. In the great fire, it had been de|termined
to murther the King; but he had di&s;covered
&s;uch diligence and humanity in extingui&s;hing the flames,
that even the je&s;uits relented, and &s;pared his life. Be|&s;ides the&s;e a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations and fires; in&s;urrections, rebel|lions,
and ma&s;&s;acres were projected by that religious or|der
in all the three kingdoms. There were twenty
thou&s;and Catholics in London, who would ri&s;e in four
and twenty hours or les; and Jenni&s;on, a je&s;uit, &s;aid,
that they might ea&s;ily cut the throats of an hundred thou|&s;and
Prote&s;tants. Eight thou&s;and Catholics had agreed
to take arms in Scotland. Ormond was to be murthered
by four je&s;uits; a general ma&s;&s;acre of the Iri&s;h prote&s;t|ants
was concerted; and forty thou&s;and black bills
were already provided for that purpo&s;e. Coleman had
remitted two hundred thou&s;and pounds to promote the
rebellion in Ireland; and the French King was to land
a great army in that i&s;land. Poole, who wrote the Sy|nop&s;is,
was particularly marked out for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination;
as was al&s;o, Dr. Stilllingfleet, a controver&s;ial writer again&s;t
the Papi&s;ts. Burnet tells us, that Oates paid him the
&s;ame compliment. After all this havoc, the crown was
to be offer'd to the Duke, but on the following condi|tions;
that he receive it as a gift from the Pope; that
he confirm all the papal commi&s;&s;ions for offices and em|ployments;
that he ratify all pa&s;t tran&s;actions, by par|doning
the incendiaries, and the murderers of his bro|ther
and of the people; and that he con&s;ent to the utter
extirpation of the prote&s;tant religion. If he refu&s;e the&s;e
conditions, he himfelf was immediately to be poi&s;oned
or a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated. <HI>To pot James mu&s;t go;</HI> according to the
expre&s;&s;ion a&s;cribed by Oates to the je&s;uits.</P>
<P>OATES, the informer of this dreadful plot, was him|&s;elf the mo&s;t infamous of mankind. He was the &s;on of
an anabapti&s;t preacher, chaplain to colonel Pride; but
having taken orders in the church, he had been provided

in a &s;mall living by the duke of Norfolk. He had been
indicted for perjury; and by &s;ome means had e&s;caped.
He was afterwards a chaplain on board the fleet;
whence he had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed on complaint of &s;ome un|natural
practices, not fit to be named. He then became
a convert to the Catholics; but he afterwards boa&s;ted,
that his conver&s;ion was a mere pretence, in order to get
into their &s;ecrets, and to betray them<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">Burnet, Echard, North, L'E&s;trange, &amp;c.</NOTE>: He was &s;ent
over to the je&s;uit's college at St. Omers, and tho' above
thirty years of age, he there lived &s;ome time among the
&s;tudents. He was di&s;patched on an errand to Spain;
and thence returned to St. Omers; where the je&s;uits,
heartily tired of their convert, at la&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed him from
their &s;eminary. It is likely, that from re&s;entment of this
u&s;age, he was induced, in combination with Tongue,
to contrive that plot, of which he accu&s;ed the Catholics.</P>
<P>THIS abandoned man, when examined before the
council, betrayed his impo&s;tures in &s;uch a manner, as
would have utterly di&s;credited the mo&s;t con&s;i&s;tent &s;to|ry,
and the mo&s;t reputable evidence. While in Spain,
he had been, carried, he &s;aid, to Don John, who pro|mi&s;ed
great a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the execution of the catholic de|&s;igns.
The King a&s;ked him, what &s;ort of man Don
John was: He an&s;wered, a tall, lean man; directly
contrary to truth, as the King well knew<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Burnet, North.</NOTE>. He totally
mi&s;took the &s;ituation of the je&s;uit's college at Paris<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">North.</NOTE>.
Tho' he pretended great intimacies with Coleman, he
knew him not, when placed very near him; and had no
other excu&s;e than that his &s;ight was bad in candle-light<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, North, Triale.</NOTE>.
He fell into like mi&s;takes with regard to Wakeman.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the&s;e objections, great atten|tion
was paid to Oates's evidence, and the plot became very
&s;oon the &s;ubject of conver&s;ation, and even the object of
terror to the people. The violent animo&s;ity, which had
been excited again&s;t the Catholics in general, made the
<PB N="69" REF="91">
public &s;wallow the gro&s;&s;e&s;t ab&s;urdities, when they ac|companied
an accu&s;ation of tho&s;e religioni&s;ts: And the more
diabolical any contrivance appeared, the better it &s;uited the
tremendous idea entertained of a je&s;uit. Danby likewi&s;e,
who &s;tood in oppo&s;ition to the French and catholic inte|re&s;t
at court, was willing to encourage every &s;tory, which
might &s;erve to di&s;credit that party. By his &s;ugge&s;tion,
when a warrant was &s;igned for arre&s;ting Coleman, there
was in&s;erted a clau&s;e for &s;eizing his papers; a circum|&s;tance attended with the mo&s;t important con&s;equences.</P>
<P>COLEMAN, partly on his own account,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coleman's letters.</NOTE> partly by or|ders
from the Duke, had been engaged in a corre&s;pon|dence
with father la Chai&s;e, with the Pope's nuncio at
Bru&s;&s;els, and with other Catholics abroad; and being
him&s;elf a fiery zealot, bu&s;y and &s;anguine, the expre&s;&s;ions
in his letters often betrayed great violence and indi&s;cre|tion.
His corre&s;pondence during the years 1674, 1675,
and part of 1676, was &s;eized, and contained many ex|traordinary
pa&s;&s;ages. In particular he &s;aid to la Chai&s;e,
&startq; We have here a mighty work upon our hands, no le&s;s
than the conver&s;ion of three kingdoms, and by that
perhaps the utter &s;ubduing of a pe&s;tilent here&s;y, which
has a long time domineered over a great part of this
northern world. There were never &s;uch hopes of
&s;ucce&s;s, &s;ince the days of Queen Mary, as now in our
days. God has given us a prince,&endq; meaning the
Duke, &startq; who is become (may I &s;ay a miracle) zealous
of being the author and in&s;trument of &s;o glorious a
work; but the oppo&s;ition we are &s;ure to meet with is
al&s;o like to be great: So that it imports us to get all the
aid and a&s;&s;i&s;tance we can.&endq; In another letter he &s;aid,
&startq;I can &s;carce believe my&s;elf awake, or the thing real,
when I think of a Prince in &s;uch an age as we live
in, converted to &s;uch a degree of zeal and piety, as
not to regard any thing in the world in compari&s;on
of God Almighty's glory, the &s;alvation of his own
<PB N="70" REF="92">
&s;oul, and the conver&s;ion of our poor kingdom.&endq; In
other pa&s;&s;ages, the intere&s;ts of the Crown of England,
tho&s;e of the French King, and tho&s;e of the catholic re|ligion
are &s;poke of as in&s;eparable. The Duke is al&s;o &s;aid
to have connected his intere&s;ts unalterably with tho&s;e of
Lewis. The King him&s;elf, he affirms, is always in|clined
to favour the Catholics, when he may do it with|out
hazard. &startq; Money,&endq; Coleman adds, &startq; cannot fail
of per&s;wading the King to any thing. There is no|thing
it cannot make him do, were it ever &s;o much to
his prejudice. It has &s;uch an ab&s;olute power over
him, that he cannot re&s;i&s;t it. Logic in our court
built upon money, has more powerful charms than
any other &s;ort of argument.&endq; For the&s;e rea&s;ons, he
propo&s;es to father la Chai&s;e, that the French King &s;hould
remit the &s;um of 300,000 pounds, on condition that the
Parliament be di&s;&s;olved; a mea&s;ure, to which, he &s;ays,
the King was, of him&s;elf, &s;ufficiently inclined, were it
not for his hopes of obtaining money from that a&s;&s;embly.
The Parliament, he &s;aid, had already con&s;trained the
King to make peace with Holland, contrary to the in|tere&s;ts
of the catholic religion, and of his mo&s;t chri&s;tian
maje&s;ty: And if they &s;hould meet again, they would
&s;urely engage him farther, and even to make war
again&s;t France. It appears al&s;o from the &s;ame letters,
that the a&s;&s;embling the Parliament &s;o late as April in the
year 1675, had been procured by the intrigues of the ca|tholic
and French party, who thereby intended to &s;how
the Dutch and other confederates abroad, that they could
expect no a&s;&s;i&s;tance from England.</P>
<P>WHEN the contents of the&s;e letters were publicly
known, they diffu&s;ed the panic,, with which the nation
began already to be &s;eized on account of the popi&s;h
plot. Men rea&s;oned more from their fears and their
pa&s;&s;ions than from the evidence before them. It is cer|tain,
that the active and enterprizing &s;pirit of the ca|tholic
<PB N="71" REF="93">
church, particularly of the je&s;uits, merits atten|tion,
and is, in &s;ome degree, dangerous to every other
communion. Such zeal of pro&s;elyti&s;m actuates that
&s;ect, that its mi&s;&s;ionaries have penetrated into every na|tion
of the globe; and in one &s;en&s;e there is a <HI>popi&s;h plot</HI>
perpetually carried on again&s;t: all &s;tates, Prote&s;tant, Pa|gan,
and Mahometan. It is likewi&s;e very probable, that
the conversion of the Duke, and the favour of the King,
had in&s;pired the catholic prie&s;ts with new hopes of reco|vering
in the&s;e i&s;lands their lo&s;t dominion, and gave fre&s;h
vigour to that intemperate zeal, by which they are com|monly
actuated. Their fir&s;t aim was to obtain a tolera|tion;
and &s;uch was the evidence, they believed, of their
theological tenets, that, could they but procure entire
liberty, they mu&s;t infallibly in time open the eyes of
the people. After they had converted con&s;iderable num|bers,
they might be enabled, they hoped, to re-in&s;tate
them&s;elves in full authority, and entirely to &s;uppre&s;s that
here&s;y, with which the kingdom had &s;o long been in|fected.
Tho' the&s;e dangers to the prote&s;tant religion
were very di&s;tant, it was ju&s;tly the object of great con|cern
to find, that the heir apparent to the crown was &s;o
blinded with bigotry, and &s;o deeply engaged in foreign
intere&s;ts; and that the King him&s;elf had been prevailed
with, from low intere&s;ts, to hearken to his dangerous in|&s;inuations.
Very bad con&s;equences might en&s;ue from
&s;uch perver&s;e habits and attachments; nor could the na|tion
and Parliament guard again&s;t them with too anxious
a precaution. But that the Roman pontiff could hope to
a&s;&s;ume the &s;overeignty of the&s;e kingdoms; a project,
which, even during the darkne&s;s of the eleventh and
twelfth centuries, would have appeared chimerical:
That he &s;hould delegate this authority to the je&s;uits; that
order in the Romi&s;h church, which was the mo&s;t hated:
That a ma&s;&s;acre could be attempted of the Prote&s;tants,
who &s;urpa&s;&s;ed the Catholics a hundred fold, and were

inve&s;ted with the whole authority, of the &s;tate: That the
King him&s;elf was to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated, and even the Duke,
the only &s;upport of their party: The&s;e were &s;uch ab|&s;urdities as no human te&s;timony was &s;ufficient to prove;
much le&s;s the evidence of one man, who was noted for
infamy, and who could not keep him&s;elf, every mo|ment,
from falling into the gro&s;&s;e&s;t incon&s;i&s;tencies. Did
&s;uch intelligence de&s;erve even &s;o much attention as to be
refuted, it would appear, that Coleman's letters were
&s;ufficient alone to de&s;troy all its credit. For how could
&s;o long a train of corre&s;pondence be carried on, by a man
&s;o much tru&s;ted by the party; and yet no traces of in|&s;urrections, if really intended, of fires, ma&s;&s;acres, a&s;&s;a&s;|&s;inations,
inva&s;ions, be ever di&s;covered in any &s;ingle
pa&s;&s;age of the&s;e letters? But all &s;uch reflections, and
many more equally obvious, were vainly employed
again&s;t that general prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, with which the nation
was &s;eized. Oates's plot and Coleman's were univer|&s;ally
confounded: And the evidence of the latter being
unque&s;tionable, the belief of the former, aided by the
pa&s;&s;ions of hatred and of terror, took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;on of the
whole people.</P>
<P>THERE was danger however,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of Oc|tober. Godfrey's murder.</NOTE> le&s;t time might open the
eyes of the public; when the murther of Godfrey com|pleated
the general delu&s;ion, and rendered the prejudices
of the nation absolutely incurable. This magi&s;trate had
been mi&s;&s;ing &s;ome days; and after much &s;earch, and
many &s;urmizes, his body was found lying in a ditch at
Primro&s;e-hill: The marks of &s;trangling were thought to
appear about his neck, and &s;ome contusions on his
brea&s;t: His own &s;word was &s;ticking in the body; but as
no con&s;iderable quantity of blood en&s;ued on drawing it,
it was concluded, that it had been thru&s;t in after his
death, and that he had not killed him&s;elf: He had rings
on his fingers and money in his pocket: It was there|fore
inferred, that he had not fallen into the hands of
<PB N="73" REF="97">
robbers. Without farther rea&s;oning, the cry ro&s;e, that
he had been a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the Papi&s;ts, on account of
his taking Oates's evidence. This clamour was quickly
propagated, and met with universal belief. The panic
&s;pread it&s;elf on every &s;ide with infinite rapidity; and all
men, a&s;toni&s;hed with fear, and animated with rage, &s;aw
in Godfrey's fate all the horrible de&s;igns a&s;cribed to the
Catholics; and no farther doubt remained of Oates's
veracity. The voice of the whole nation united again&s;t
that hated &s;ect; and notwith&s;tanding that the bloody
con&s;piracy was &s;uppo&s;ed to be now di&s;covered, men
could &s;carce be per&s;waded, that their lives were yet in
&s;afety. Each hour teemed with new rumours and &s;ur|mizes.
Inva&s;ions from abroad, in&s;urrections at home,
even private murthers and poi&s;onings were apprehended.
To deny the reality of the plot was to be an accomplice:<NOTE PLACE="marg">General con&s;tern$|tion.</NOTE>
To he&s;itate was criminal; Royali&s;t, Republican;
Churchman, Sectary; Courtier, Patriot; all parties

its defence, as if the enemy were at its gates: The
chains and po&s;ts were put up: And it was a noted &s;aying
at that time of Sir Thomas Player, the chamberlain,
that were it not for the&s;e precautions, all the citizens
might ri&s;e next morning with their throats cut<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">North, p. 206.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to propagate the popular phrenzy, &s;everal ar|tifices

carried into the city, attended by va&s;t multitudes. It
was publickly expo&s;ed in the &s;treets, and viewed by all
ranks of men; and every one, who &s;aw it, went away
inflamed, as well by the mutual contagion of &s;entiments,
as by the di&s;mal &s;pectacle it&s;elf. The funeral pomp was
celebrated with great parade. It was conducted thro' the
chief &s;treets of the city: Seventy-two clergymen marched

mounted the pulpit, and &s;tood on each &s;ide of the
preacher, le&s;t, in paying the la&s;t office to this unhappy
magi&s;trate, he &s;hould, before the whole people, be
murthered by the Papi&s;ts<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">North, p. 205.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN this di&s;po&s;ition of the nation, rea&s;on could no more
be heard than a whi&s;per in the mid&s;t of the mo&s;t violent
hurricane. Even at pre&s;ent, Godfrey's, murther cannot
upon any &s;y&s;tem be rationally accounted for. That he
was a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by the Catholics, &s;eems utterly impro|bable.
The&s;e religioni&s;ts could not be engaged to com|mit
that crime from <HI>policy,</HI> in order to deter other magi&s;|trates
from acting again&s;t them. Godfrey's fate was no
wi&s;e capable of producing that effect, unle&s;s it were
publickly known, that the Catholics were his murther|ers;
an opinion, which, it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, mu&s;t
prove the ruin of their party. Be&s;ides, how many
magi&s;trates, during more than a century, had acted in
the mo&s;t violent manner, without its being ever &s;u&s;|pected,
that any one had been cut off by a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination?
Such jealous times as the pre&s;ent were &s;urely ill fitted for
beginning the&s;e dangerous experiments. Shall we there|fore
&s;ay, that the Catholics were pu&s;hed on, not by po|licy,
but by blind <HI>revenge</HI> again&s;t Godfrey? But Godfrey
had given them little or no occa&s;ion of offence in taking
Oates's evidence. His part was merely an act of form,
belonging to his office; nor could he, or any man in his
&s;tation, po&s;&s;ibly refu&s;e it. In the re&s;t of his conduct,
he lived on good terms with the Catholics, and was far
from di&s;tingui&s;hing him&s;elf by his &s;everity again&s;t that
&s;ect. It is even certain, that he had contracted an in|timacy
with Coleman, and took care to inform his friend
of the danger to which, by rea&s;on of Oates's evidence,
he was at pre&s;ent expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THERE are &s;ome writers, who, finding it impo&s;&s;ible
to account for Godfrey's murther by the machinations of
<PB N="75" REF="99">
the Catholics, have recour&s;e to the oppo&s;ite &s;uppo&s;ition.
They lay hold of that common pre&s;umption, that tho&s;e
commit the crime who reap profit by it; and they affirm
that it was Shafte&s;bury and the heads of the popular
party, who perpetrated that deed, in order to throw the
odium of it on the Papi&s;ts. But if this &s;uppo&s;ition be
received, it mu&s;t al&s;o be admitted, that the whole plot
was the contrivance of tho&s;e politicians; and that Oates
acted altogether under their direction. But it appears,
that Oates, dreading probably the oppo&s;ition of power|ful
enemies, had very anxiou&s;ly acquitted the Duke,
Danby, Ormond, and all the mini&s;try; per&s;ons who
were certainly the mo&s;t obnoxious to the popular leaders.
Be&s;ides, the whole texture of the plot contains &s;uch low
ab&s;urdity, that it is impo&s;&s;ible to have been the inven|tion
of any man of &s;en&s;e or education. It is true, the more
mon&s;trous and horrible the con&s;piracy, the better was it
fitted to terrify, and thence to convince the populace:
But this effect, we $ay &s;afely &s;ay, no one could before|hand
have promi&s;ed upon; and a fool was in this ca&s;e
more likely to &s;ucceed than a wi&s;e man. Had Shafte&s;|bury
laid the plan of a popi&s;h conspiracy, he had pro|bably
rendered it moderate, con&s;i&s;tent, credible; and on
that very account had never met with the prodigious &s;uc|ce&s;s,
with which Oates's tremendous fictions were at|tended.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t, therefore, be contented to remain for ever
ignorant of the actors of Godfrey's murther; and only
pronounce in general, that that event, in all likelihood,
had no connexion, one way or other, with the popi&s;h
plot. Any man, e&s;pecially &s;o active a magi&s;trate as Godfrey,
might, in &s;uch a city as London, have many enemies,
of whom his friends and family had no &s;u&s;picion. He
was a melancholy man; and there is &s;ome rea&s;on, not|with&s;tanding
all the pretended appearances to the con|trary,
to &s;u&s;pect that he fell by his own hands. The
<PB N="76" REF="100">
affair was never examined with tranquillity, or even
common &s;en&s;e, during the time: and it is impo&s;&s;ible
for us, at this di&s;tance, certainly to account for it.</P>
<P>NO ONE doubted but the papi&s;ts had a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated God|frey:
but &s;till the particular actors were unknown. A
proclamation was i&s;&s;ued by the King, offering a pardon
and five hundred pounds reward to any one who would
di&s;covcr them. As it was afterwards &s;urmized, that the
terror of a like a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination would prevent di&s;covery, a
new proclamation was i&s;&s;ued, promi&s;ing ab&s;olute protec|tion
to any one who would reveal the &s;ecret. Thus
were indemnity, money, and &s;ecurity offered to the
faire&s;t bidder: And no one needed to fear, during the
pre&s;ent fury of the people, that his evidence would un|dergo
too &s;evere a &s;crutiny.</P>
<P>WHILE the nation was in this ferment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t of Oc|tober. The Par|liament.</NOTE> the Parlia|ment
was a&s;&s;embled. In his &s;peech the King told them,
that tho' they had given money for di$$banding the army<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">They had granted him 600,000 pounds for di&s;banding the army, for re-imbur&s;ing the charges of his naval armament, and for paying the Prin|ce&s;s of Orange's portion.</NOTE>,
he had found Flanders &s;o expo&s;ed, that he had thought
it nece&s;&s;ary &s;till to keep them on foot, and doubted not
but this mea&s;ure would meet with their approbation.
He informed them, that his revenue lay under great an|ticipations,
and at be&s;t was never equal to the con&s;tant
and nece&s;&s;ary expence of the government; as would ap|pear
from the &s;tate of it, which he intended to lay be|fore
them. He al&s;o mentioned the plot, carried on
again&s;t his life by the je&s;uits; but &s;aid, that he would
forbear delivering any opinion of the matter, le&s;t he
&s;hould &s;eem to &s;ay too much or too little; and that he
would leave the &s;crutiny of it entirely to the law.</P>
<P>THE King was anxious to keep the que&s;tion of the
popi&s;h plot from the Parliament, where he &s;u&s;pected
many de&s;igning people would very much abu&s;e the pre|&s;ent
<PB N="77" REF="101">
credulity of the nation: But Danby, who hated the
catholics, and courted popularity, and perhaps hoped, that
the King, if his life was believed to be in danger from the
je&s;uits, would be more cordially loved by the nation, had
entertained oppo&s;ite de&s;igns; and the very fir&s;t day of the
&s;e&s;&s;ion, he opened the matter in the Hou&s;e of Peers.
The King was extremely di&s;plea&s;ed with this temerity,
and told his mini&s;ter, &startq;Though you do not believe it,
you will find, that you have given the Parliament a
handle to ruin your&s;elf, as well as to di&s;turb all my
affairs; and you will &s;urely live to repent it.&endq; Dan|by
had afterwards &s;ufficient rea&s;on to applaud the &s;aga|city
of his ma&s;ter.</P>
<P>The cry of the plot was immediately echoed from one
Hou&s;e to the other.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Zeal of the Parliament.</NOTE> The verdict of Parliament gave
&s;anction to that fury, with which the people were already
agitated. An addre&s;s was voted for a &s;olemn fa&s;t: A
form of prayer was contrived for that &s;ervice; and be|cau&s;e
the popi&s;h plot had been omitted in the fir&s;t
draught, it was carefully ordered to be in&s;erted; le&s;t
omni&s;cience &s;hould want intelligence, to u&s;e the words
of an hi&s;torian<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">North, p. 207.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>IN order to continue and propagate the alarm, ad|dre&s;&s;es
were voted for laying before the hou&s;e &s;uch pa|pers
as might di&s;cover the horrible con&s;piracy; for the
removal of popi&s;h recu&s;ants from London; for admini|&s;tering
every where the oaths of allegiance and &s;upre|macy;
for denying acce&s;s at court to all unknown
and &s;u&s;picious per&s;ons; and for appointing the train|bands
of London and We&s;tmin&s;ter to be in readine&s;s.
The lords Powis, Stafford, Arundel, Peters, and Bel|la&s;is
were committed to the Tower, and were &s;oon after
impeached for high trea&s;on. And both Hou&s;es, after
hearing Oates's evidence, voted, &startq; That the Lords and
Commons are of opinion, that there hath been, and
<PB N="78" REF="102">
&s;till is, a damnable and helli&s;h plot, contrived and car|ried
on by the popi&s;h recu&s;ants, for a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inating and
murdering the King, for &s;ubverting the government,
and for rooting out and de&s;troying the prote&s;tant re|ligion.&endq;</P>
<P>So vehement were the Hou&s;es, that they &s;at every
day, forenoon and afternoon, on the &s;ubject of the plot:
For no other bu&s;ine&s;s could be admitted. A committee
of Lords were appointed to examine pri&s;oners and wit|ne&s;&s;es:
Blank warrants were put into their hands, for
the commitment of &s;uch as &s;hould be accu&s;ed or &s;u&s;pec|ted.
Oates, who, tho' his evidence were true, mu&s;t,
by his own confe&s;&s;ion, be regarded as an infamous vil|lain,
was by every one applauded, care&s;&s;ed, and called
the &s;aviour of the nation. He was recommended by the
parliament to the King. He was lodged in Whitehall,
protected by guards, and encouraged by a pen&s;ion of
1200 pounds a year.</P>
<P>IT was not long before &s;uch bountiful encouragement
brought forth new witne&s;&s;es. William Bedloe, a man,
if po&s;&s;ible, more infamous than Oates, appeared next
upon the &s;tage. He was of very low birth, had been
noted for &s;everal cheats and even thefts, had travelled
over many parts of Europe under borrowed names, had
frequently pa&s;&s;ed him&s;elf for a man of quality, and had
endeavoured, by a variety of lyes and contrivances, to
prey upon the ignorant and unwary. When he appeared
before the council, he gave intelligence only of God|frey's
murther, which, he &s;aid, had been perpetrated in
Somer&s;et-hou&s;e, where the Queen lived, by papi&s;ts,
&s;ome of them &s;ervants in her family. He was que&s;tioned
about the plot; but utterly denied all knowlege of it
and al&s;o a&s;&s;erted, that he had no acquaintance with Oates
Next day, when examined before the committee o
Lords, he bethought him&s;elf better, and was ready to
give an ample account of the plot, which he found $word$
<PB N="79" REF="103">
anxiou&s;ly inquired into. This narrative he made to tally,
as well as he could, with that of Oates, which had
been publi&s;hed: But that he might make him&s;elf accept|able
by new information, he added &s;ome other circum|&s;tances,
and tho&s;e, &s;till more tremendous and extraor|dinary.
He &s;aid, that ten thou&s;and men were to be
landed from Flanders in Burlington Bay, and immedi|ately
to &s;eize Hull: That Jer&s;ey and Guern&s;ey were to
be &s;urprized by forces from Bre&s;t; and that a French
fleet were, all la&s;t &s;ummer, hovering in the Channel for
that purpo&s;e: That the lords Powis and Peters were to
form an army in Radnor&s;hire, to be joined by another
army, con&s;i&s;ting of twenty or thirty thou&s;and religious
men and pilgrims, who were to land at Milford Haven
from St. Iago in Spain: That there were forty thou&s;and
men ready in London; be&s;ides tho&s;e, who would, on
the alarm, be po&s;ted at every alehou&s;e door, in order to
kill the &s;oldiers, as they came out of their quarters:
That lord Stafford, Coleman, and father Ireland had
money &s;ufficient to defray the expences of all the&s;e ar|maments:
That he him&s;elf was to receive four thou&s;and
pounds, as one that could murder a man; as al&s;o a com|mi&s;&s;ion
from lord Bella&s;is, and a benediction from the
Pope: That the King was to be a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated; all the Pro|te&s;tants
ma&s;&s;acred who would not &s;eriou&s;ly be converted;
the government offered to ONE, if he would con&s;ent to
hold it of the church; but if he &s;hould refu&s;e that con|dition,
as was &s;u&s;pected, the authority would be left to
certain lords under the nomination of the Pope. In a
&s;ub&s;equent examination before the Commons, Bedloe
added (for the&s;e men always brought their intelligence
&s;ucce&s;&s;ively and by piece-meal) that lord Carrington was
al&s;o in the con&s;piracy for rai&s;ing men and money again&s;t
the government; as was likewi&s;e lord Brudenel. The&s;e
noblemen, with all other per&s;ons mentioned by Bedloe,
were immediately committed to cu&s;tody by the Parliament.

IT is remarkable, that the only re&s;ource of Spain, in
her pre&s;ent decayed condition, lay in the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of
England; and, &s;o far from being in a &s;ituation to tran|&s;port
ten thou&s;and men for the inva&s;ion of that king|dom,
&s;he had &s;ollicited and obtained Engli&s;h forces to be
&s;ent into the garri&s;ons of Flanders, which were not
otherwi&s;e able to defend them&s;elves again&s;t the French.
The French too, we may ob&s;erve, were, at that very
time, in open war with Spain, and yet are &s;uppo&s;ed to be
engaged in the &s;ame de&s;ign again&s;t England; as if religious
motives were become the &s;ole actuating principle among
&s;overeigns. But none of the&s;e circum&s;tances; however
obvious, were able, when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to multiplied
horrors, antipathies, and prejudices, to engage the lea&s;t
attention of the populace: For &s;uch the whole nation
were at this time become. The popi&s;h plot pa&s;&s;ed for
inconte&s;tible: And had not men &s;oon expected with cer|tainty
the legal puni&s;hment of the&s;e criminals, the Ca|tholics
had been expo&s;ed to the hazard of an univer&s;al
ma&s;&s;acre. The torrent indeed of national prejudices ran
&s;o high, that no-one, without the mo&s;t imminent dan|ger,
dur&s;t venture openly to oppo&s;e it; nay, &s;carce
any-one, without great force of judgment, could &s;ecretly
entertain an opinion contrary to the prevailing &s;enti|ments.
The loud and unanimous voice of a great na|tion
has mighty authority over weak minds; and even
later hi&s;torians are &s;o &s;wayed by the concurring judg|ment
of &s;uch multitudes, that &s;ome of them have e&s;teemed
them&s;elves &s;ufficiently moderate, when they affirmed,
that many circum&s;tances of the plot were true, tho'
&s;ome were added, and others much magnified. But it
is an obvious principle, that a witne&s;s, who perjures
him&s;elf, in one circum&s;tance, is credible in none: And
the authority of the plot, even to the end of the pro&s;e|cutions,
&s;tood entirely upon witne&s;&s;es. Tho' the Ca|tholics
had been &s;uddenly and unexpectedly detected, at
<PB N="81" REF="107">
the very moment, when their con&s;piracy, it is &s;aid, was
ready to be put in execution; no arms, no ammunition,
no money, no commi&s;&s;ions, no papers, no letters, af|ter
the mo&s;t rigorous &s;earch, ever were di&s;couraraged, to
confirm the evidence of Oates and Bedloe. Yet &s;till
the nation, tho' often fru&s;trated, went on in the eager
pur&s;uit and confident belief of the con&s;piracy: And even
the manifold incon&s;i&s;tencies and ab&s;urdities, contained
in the Narratives, in&s;tead of di&s;covering them, &s;erved
only as farther incentives to di&s;cover the bottom of the
plot, and were con&s;idered as &s;light objections, which a
more complete information would fully remove. In all
hi&s;tory, it will be difficult to find &s;uch another in&s;tance
of popular frenzy and bigotted delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>IN order to &s;upport the panic among the people, e&s;pe|cially
among the citizens of London, a pamphlet was
publi&s;hed with this title, &startq;A narrative and impartial
di&s;covery of the horrid popi&s;h plot, carried on for
burning and de&s;troying the cities of London and We&s;t|min&s;ter
with their &s;uburbs; &s;etting forth the &s;everal
con&s;ults, orders, and re&s;olutions of the je&s;uits, con|cerning
the &s;ame: By captain William Bedloe, lately
engaged in that horrid de&s;ign, and one of the popi&s;h
committee for carrying on &s;uch fires&endq; Every fire,
which had happened for &s;everal years pa&s;t, is there a&s;cri|bed
to the machinations of the je&s;uits, who propo&s;ed,
as Bedloe &s;aid, by &s;uch attempts to find an opportunity
for the general ma&s;&s;acre of the prote&s;tants; and in the
mean time, were plea&s;ed to enrich them&s;elves by pilfer|ing
goods from the fires.</P>
<P>THE King, tho' he &s;crupled not, wherever he could
u&s;e freedom, to throw the highe&s;t ridicule on the plot,
and on all who believed it; yet found it nece&s;&s;ary to
adopt the popular opinion before the Parliament. The
torrent, he &s;aw, ran too &s;trong to be controuled; and
be could only hope, by a &s;eeming compliance, to be
<PB N="82" REF="108">
able, after &s;ome time, to guide and direct and elude its
fury. He made therefore a &s;peech to both Hou&s;es; in
which he told them, that he would take the utmo&s;t care
of his per&s;on during the&s;e times of danger; that he was
as ready as their hearts could wi&s;h, to join with them in
all means for e&s;tabli&s;hing the prote&s;tant religion, not only
during his own time, but for all future ages; that,
provided the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was pre&s;erved, he would
con&s;ent to any laws for re&s;training a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or:
And in conclu&s;ion, he exhorted them to think of effec|tual
means for the conviction of popi&s;h recu&s;ants; and
he highly prai&s;ed the duty and loyalty of all his &s;ubjects,
who had di&s;covered &s;uch anxious concern for his &s;afety.</P>
<P>THESE gracious expre&s;&s;ions abated nothing of the vehe|mence
of parliamentary proceedings. A bill was introduced
for a new te&s;t, in which popery was denominated idola|try;
and all members, who refu&s;ed this te&s;t, were exclu|ded
both Hou&s;es. The bill pa&s;&s;ed the Commons without
much oppo&s;ition; but in the upper Hou&s;e the Duke moved,
that an exception might be admitted in his favour.
With great earne&s;tne&s;s, and even wth tears in his eyes,
he told them, that he was now to ca&s;t him&s;elf on their
kindne&s;s, in the greate&s;t concern, which he could have
in the world; and he prote&s;ted, that, whatever his re|ligion
might be, it &s;hould only be a private thing be|tween
God and his own &s;oul, and never &s;hould appear in
his public conduct. Notwith&s;tanding this &s;trong effort,
in &s;o important a point, he prevailed only by two
voices; a &s;ufficient indication of the general di&s;po&s;ition
of the people. &startq;I would not have,&endq; &s;aid a noble Peer,
in the debate on this bill, &startq;&s;o much as a popi&s;h man
or a popi&s;h woman to remain here; not &s;o much as a
popi&s;h dog or a popi&s;h bitch; not &s;o much as a popi&s;h
cat to pur or mew about the King.&endq; What is mor$
extraordinary, this &s;peech met with prai&s;e and appro$
bation.</P>
<P><PB N="83" REF="109">
ENCOURAGED by this general fury, the witne&s;&s;es went
till a &s;tep farther in their accu&s;ations; and tho' both
Oates and Bedloe had often declared, that there was no
other per&s;on of di&s;tinction, whom they knew to be con|cerned
in the plot, they were now &s;o audacious as to ac|cu&s;e
even the Queen her&s;elf of entering into the de&s;ign
again&s;t her hu&s;band's life. The Commons, in an ad|dre&s;s
to the King, gave countenance to this &s;candalous
accu&s;ation; but the Lords would not be prevailed with
to join in the addre&s;s. It is here, if any where, that
we may &s;u&s;pect the &s;ugge&s;tions of the popular leaders
to have had place. The King, it was well known,
bore no great affection to his con&s;ort; and now more
than ever, when his heir apparent was &s;o much hated,
had rea&s;on to be de&s;irous of i&s;&s;ue, which might quiet the
jealous fears of his people. This very hatred&punc; which
prevailed again&s;t the Duke, would much facilitate, he
knew, any expedient that could be devi&s;ed for the ex|clu&s;ion
of that Prince; and nothing farther &s;eemed re|qui&s;ite
for the King, than to give way in this particular
to the rage and fury of the nation. But Charles, not|with&s;tanding
all allurements of plea&s;ure, or intere&s;t, or
&s;afety, had the genero&s;ity to protect his injured con&s;ort.
&startq;They think,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;I have a mind to a new wife;
but for all that I will not &s;ee an innocent woman
abu&s;ed<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">North's Emamen, p. 186.</NOTE>.&endq; He immediately ordered Oates to be
&s;trictly confined, &s;eized his papers, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his
&s;ervants; and this daring informer was obliged to make
applications to Parliament, in order to recover his liberty.</P>
<P>DURING this agitation of men's minds, the Parlia|ment
gave new attention to the militia; a circum&s;tance,
which, even during the times of greate&s;t tranquillity,
can never prudently be neglected. They pa&s;&s;ed a bill,
by which it was enacted, that a regular militia &s;hould
be kept in arms, during &s;ix weeks of the year, and a
<PB N="84" REF="110">
third part of them do duty every fortnight of that time.
The popular leaders probably intended to make u&s;e of the
general prejudices, and even to turn the arms of the
people again&s;t the Prince<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 437.</NOTE>. But Charles refu&s;ed his a&s;|&s;ent
to the bill, and told the Parliament, that he would
not, were it for half an hour, part &s;o far with the power
of the &s;word: But if they would contrive any other
bill for ordering the militia, and &s;till leave it in his
power to a&s;&s;emble or di&s;mi&s;s them as he thought proper,
he would willingly give it the royal &s;anction. The Com|mons,
di&s;&s;atisfied with this negative, tho' the King had never
before employed that prerogative, immediately voted that
all the new-levied forces &s;hould be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed. They
pa&s;&s;ed a bill, granting money for that &s;ervice; but to
&s;hew their extreme jealou&s;y of the Crown, be&s;ides ap|propriating
that money by the &s;tricte&s;t clau&s;es, they or|dered
it to be paid, not into the exchequer, but into the
chamber of London. The Lords demurred with regard
to &s;o extraordinary a clau&s;e, which threw a violent re|flection
on the King's mini&s;ters, and even on him&s;elf&punc;
and by that means the act remained in &s;u&s;pence.</P>
<P>IT was no wonder, that the pre&s;ent ferment and cre|dulity
of the nation engaged men of infamous character
and indigent circum&s;tances to become informers;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Accu&s;ation of Danby.</NOTE> when
per&s;ons of rank and condition could be tempted to give into
that &s;candalous practice. Montague, the King's amba&s;&s;a|dor
at Paris, had procured a $eat in the lower Hou&s;e;
and without obtaining or a&s;king the King's leave, he
&s;uddenly came over into England. Charles, &s;u&s;pecting
his intention, ordered his papers to be &s;eized; but Mon|tague,
who fore&s;aw this mea&s;ure, had taken care to &s;e|crete
one paper, which he immediately laid before the
Hou&s;e of Commons. It was a letter from the trea&s;urer
Danby, wrote at the beginning of the year, during the
negotiations at Nimeguen for the general peace. Mon|tague
<PB N="85" REF="111">
was there directed to make a demand of money;
or in other words, the King was willing &s;ecretly to &s;ell
his good offices to France, contrary to the general in|tere&s;ts
of the confederates, and even to tho&s;e of his own
kingdoms. The letter, among other particulars, con|tains
the&s;e words: &startq;In ca&s;e the conditions of peace
&s;hall be accepted, the king expects to have &s;ix milli|ons
of livres a year for three years, from the time
that this agreement &s;hall be &s;igned between his Ma|je&s;ty
and the King of France; becau&s;e it will pro|bably
be two or three years before the Parliament will
be in humour to give him any &s;upplies after the making
of any peace with France; and the amba&s;&s;ador here
has always agreed to that &s;um; but not for &s;o long a
time.&endq; Danby was &s;o unwilling to engage in this ne|gotiation,
that the King, to &s;atisfy him, &s;ubjoined with
his own hand the&s;e words; &startq;This letter is writ by my
order, C. R.&endq;</P>
<P>THE Commons were inflamed with this intelligence;
and carrying their &s;u&s;picions much farther than the truth,
they concluded, that the King had all along acted in
concert with the French court; and that every &s;tep,
which he had taken in conjunction with the allies, had
been illu&s;ory and deceitful. De&s;irous of getting to the
bottom of &s;o important a &s;ecret, and being pu&s;hed by
Danby's numerous enemies, they immediately voted an im|peachment
of high trea&s;on again&s;t that mini&s;ter, and
&s;ent up &s;ix articles to the Hou&s;e of Peers.<NOTE PLACE="marg">His impeachment.</NOTE> The&s;e ar|ticles
were, That he had traiterou&s;ly engro&s;&s;ed to him|&s;elf
regal power, by giving in&s;tructions to his ma|je&s;ty's
amba&s;&s;adors, without the participation of the &s;e|cretaries
of &s;tate, or the privy council: That he had
traiterou&s;ly endeavoured to &s;ubvert the government, and
introduce arbitrary power; and to that end, had levied
and continued an army, contrary to act of Parliament:
That he had traiterou&s;ly endeavoured to alienate the af|fections
<PB N="86" REF="112">
of his Maje&s;ty's &s;ubjects, by negotiating a
di&s;advantageous peace with France, and procuring mo|ney
for that purpo&s;e: That he was popi&s;hly affected,
and had traiterou&s;ly concealed, after he had notice, the late
horrid and bloody plot, contrived by the papi&s;ts again&s;t
his Maje&s;ty's per&s;on and government: That he had
wa&s;ted the King's trea&s;ure: And that he had by indirect
means obtained &s;everal exorbitant grants from the Crown.</P>
<P>IT is certain that the trea&s;urer, in giving in&s;tructions
to the amba&s;&s;ador, had exceeded the bounds of his of|fice:
and as the genius of a monarchy, &s;trictly limited,
requires, that the proper mini&s;ter &s;hould be an&s;werable
for every abu&s;e of power, the Commons, tho' they here
advanced a new preten&s;ion, might ju&s;tify them&s;elves by
the utility and even nece&s;&s;ity of it. But in other re&s;pects
their charge again&s;t Danby was very ill grounded. That
mini&s;ter made it appear to the Hou&s;e of Lords, not only
that Montague, the informer again&s;t him, had all along
promoted the money-negotiations with France, but that
he him&s;elf was ever extremely aver&s;e to the intere&s;ts of
that crown, which he e&s;teemed pernicious to his ma&s;ter,
and to his country. The French nation, he &s;aid, had
always entertained, as he was certainly informed, the
highe&s;t contempt, both of the King's per&s;on and go|vernment.
His diligence, he added, in tracing and di&s;|covering
the popi&s;h plot, was generally known; and
if he had common &s;en&s;e, not to &s;ay common hone&s;ty, he
would &s;urely be anxious to pre&s;erve the life of a ma&s;ter,
by whom he was &s;o much favoured. He had wa&s;ted no
trea&s;ure, becau&s;e there was no trea&s;ure to wa&s;te. And
tho' he had rea&s;on to be grateful for the King's bounty,
he had made more moderate acqui&s;itions than were gene|rally
imagined, and than others in his office had ofte$
done, even during a &s;horter admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Peers plainly &s;aw, that, allowing al$
the charge of the Commons to be true, Danby's crim$|fell
<PB N="87" REF="113">
not under the &s;tatute of Edward the third; and tho'
the words, <HI>trea&s;on</HI> and <HI>traiterou&s;ly,</HI> had been carefully
&s;ubjoined to &s;everal articles, this appellation could not
alter the nature of things, or &s;ubject him to the penal|ties
annexed to that crime. They refu&s;ed, therefore, to
commit Danby upon this irregular charge: The Com|mons
in&s;i&s;ted on their demand; and a great conte&s;t was
likely to arise, when the King, who had already ob|&s;erved
&s;ufficient in&s;tances of the ill-humour of the Par|liament,<NOTE PLACE="marg">30th of De|cember. Di&s;&s;olution of the long Parliament.</NOTE>
thought proper to prorogue them. This pro|rogation
was &s;oon after followed by a di&s;&s;olution; a de&s;|perate
remedy in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the nation.
But the di&s;ea&s;e, it mu&s;t be owned, the King had rea|&s;on
to e&s;teem de&s;perate. The utmo&s;t rage had been di&s;covered
by the Commons, on account of the popi&s;h
plot; and their fury began already to point again&s;t the
royal family, if not again&s;t the Throne it&s;elf. The
Duke had been &s;truck at in &s;everal motions: The trea|&s;urer
had been impeached: All &s;upply had been refu&s;ed,
except on the mo&s;t di&s;agreeable conditions: Fears, jea|lou&s;ies,
and antipathies were every day multiplying in
Parliament: And tho' the people were &s;trongly infected
with the &s;ame prejudices, the King hoped, by di&s;&s;olving
the pre&s;ent cabals, that a &s;et of men might be cho&s;en,
more moderate in their pur&s;uits, and le&s;s tainted with
the virulence of faction.</P>
<P>THUS came to a period a parliament, which had &s;tate
during the whole cour&s;e of this reign, one year excepted.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Its cha|racter.</NOTE>
Its conclu&s;ion was very different from its commence|ment,
Being elected during the joy and fe&s;tivity of the
re&s;toration, it con&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t entirely of royali&s;ts;
who were di&s;po&s;ed to &s;upport the Crown by all the libera|lity,
which the habits of that age would permit. Alarmed
by the alliance with France, they gradually withdrew
their confidence from the King; and finding him &s;till
<PB N="88" REF="114">
to per&s;evere in a foreign intere&s;t, they proceeded to di&s;|cover
&s;ymptoms of the mo&s;t refractory and mo&s;t jealous
di&s;po&s;ition. The popi&s;h plot pu&s;hed them beyond all bounds
of moderation; and before their di&s;&s;olution they &s;eemed
to be treading &s;ta&s;t in the foot-&s;teps of the la&s;t long Par|liament,
on who&s;e conduct they threw at fir&s;t &s;uch vio|lent
blame. In all their variations, they had &s;till followed
the opinions and prejudices of the nation; and &s;eemed
ever to be more governed by humour and party views
than by public intere&s;t, and more by public intere&s;t than
by any corrupt or private influence.</P>
<P>DURING the fitting of the Parliament, and after its
prorogation and di&s;&s;olution, the trials of the pretended
criminals were carried on; and the courts of judicature,
places, which, if po&s;&s;ible, ought to be kept more pure
from inju&s;tice than even national a&s;&s;emblies them&s;elves,
were &s;trongly infected with the &s;ame party rage and bi|gotted
prejudices. Coleman, the mo&s;t obnoxious of
the con&s;pirators, was fir&s;t brought to his trial. His
letters were produced again&s;t him. They contained,
as he him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed, much indi&s;cRetion: But unle&s;s
&s;o far as it is illegal to be a zealous catholic, they &s;eem
to prove nothing criminal, much le&s;s trea&s;onable, again&s;t
him. Oates and Bedloe &s;wore, that he had received a
commi&s;&s;ion, &s;igned by the &s;uperior of the je&s;uits, to be
papal &s;ecretary of &s;tate, and had con&s;ented to the poi|&s;oning,
&s;hooting, and &s;tabbing the King: He had even,
according to Oates's depo&s;ition, advanced a guinea to
promote tho&s;e bloody purpo&s;es. The&s;e wild &s;tories were
all confounded with the projects contained in his letters;
and Coleman received &s;entence of death. The &s;entence
was &s;oon after executed upon him<NOTE N="t" PLACE="foot">3^d of December.</NOTE>. He &s;uffered with
calmne&s;s and con&s;tancy, and to the la&s;t per&s;i&s;ted in the
&s;tronge&s;t prote&s;tations of his innocence.</P>
<P><PB N="89" REF="115">
COLEMAN'S execution was &s;uceceded by the trial of
father Ireland, who, 'tis pretended, had &s;igned, toge|ther
with fifty je&s;uits, the great re&s;olve of murdering the
King. Grove and Pickering, who had undertaken to
&s;hoot him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Of Ireland.</NOTE> were tried at the &s;ame time. The only wit|ne&s;&s;es
again&s;t the pri&s;oners were &s;till Oates and Bedloe.
Ireland affirmed, that he was in Stafford&s;hire all the
month of Augu&s;t la&s;t, a time when Oates's evidence
made him in London. He proved his a&s;&s;ertion by good
evidence, and would have proved it by undoubted; had
he not, mo&s;t iniquitou&s;ly, been debarred, while in pri|&s;on,
of all u&s;e $word$ pen and ink, and denied the liberty of
&s;ending for witne&s;&s;es. All the&s;e men, before they came
to the bar, were condemned in the opinions of the
judges, jury, and &s;pectators; and to be a je&s;uit, or
even a Catholic, was of it&s;elf a &s;ufficient&punc; proof of
guilt. The chief ju&s;tice<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Sir William Scrogges.</NOTE> in particular gave &s;anction to
all the narrow prejudices and bigotted fury of the popu|lace.
In&s;tead of being council for the pri&s;oners, as his
office required, he pleaded the cau&s;e again&s;t them, brow|beat
their witne&s;&s;es, and on every occa&s;ion repre&s;ented
their guilt as certain and uncontroverted. He even went
&s;o far as publicly to affirm, that the Papi&s;ts had not the
&s;ame principles which Prote&s;tants have, and therefore
were not entitled to that common credence, which the
principles and practices of the latter call for. And when
the jury brought in their verdict again&s;t the pri&s;oners,
he &s;aid, &startq;You have done, gentlemen, like very good
&s;ubjects, and very good Chri&s;tians, that is to fay,
like very good Prote&s;tants: And now much good may
their 30,000 ma&s;&s;es do them.&endq; Alluding to the ma&s;&s;es,
by which Pickering was to be rewarded for murdering
the King.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1679.</NOTE> All the&s;e unhappy men went to execution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of Ja|nuary.</NOTE> prote&s;ting their innocence; a circum&s;tance, which

that the je&s;uits allowed of lies and mental re&s;ervations $word$
the promotion of a good cau&s;e, was at this time &s;o uni|ver&s;ally
received, that no credit was given to te&s;timony
delivered either by that order, or by any of their di&s;ci|ples.
It was forgot, that all the con&s;pirators, engage
in the gun-powder-trea&s;on, and Garnet, the je&s;uit
among the re&s;t, had freely on the &s;cafford made confe&s;|&s;ion
of their guilt.</P>
<P>THO' Bedloe had given information of Godfrey's mur|der,
he &s;till remained a &s;ingle evidence again&s;t the per|&s;ons
accu&s;ed; and all the allurements of profit and ho|nour
had not hitherto tempted any one to confirm the
te&s;timony of that informer. At la&s;t, means were found
to compleat the legal evidence. One Prance, a &s;ilver$&s;mith,
and a Catholic, had been accu&s;ed by Bedloe o$
being an accomplice in that murder; and upon his de|nial
had been thrown into pri&s;on, loaded with heavy
irons, and confined to the condemned hole, a place cold$
dard, and full of na&s;tine&s;s. Such rigours were &s;uppo&s;ed
to be exerci&s;ed by orders from the &s;ecret committee of
lords, particularly Shafte&s;bury and Buckingham; who&punc;
in examining the pri&s;oners, u&s;ually employed (as 'tis
&s;aid, and indeed &s;ufficiently proved) threatenings and
promi&s;es, rigour and indulgence, and every art, under
pretence of extorting the truth from them. Prance had not courage to re&s;i&s;t, but confe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf an accom|plice
in Godfrey's murder. Being a&s;ked concerning the
plot, he al&s;o thought proper to be acquainted with it,
and conveyed &s;ome intelligence to the council. Among
other ab&s;urd circum&s;tances, he &s;aid, that one Le Fevre
bought a &s;econd-hand &s;word of him; becau&s;e he knew
not, as he &s;aid, what times were at hand: And Prance,
expre&s;&s;ing &s;ome concern for poor trade&s;men, if &s;uch
times came; Le Fevre replied, that it would be better
for trade&s;men, if the catholic religion was re&s;tored:
And particularly, that there would be more church
<PB N="91" REF="119">
work for &s;ilver&s;miths. But all this information, with
regard to the plot as well as the murder of Godfrey,
Prance &s;olemnly retracted, both before the King and
the &s;ecret committee: And being again thrown into
pri&s;on, he was induced, by new terrors and new &s;uffer|ings,
to confirm his fir&s;t information, and was now pro|duced
as a &s;ufficient evidence.</P>
<P>HILL, Green and Berry were tried for Godfrey's
murder; all of them men of law &s;tation. Hill was &s;er|vant
to a phy&s;ician: The other two belonged to the po|pi&s;h
chapel at Somer&s;et Hou&s;e. It is needle&s;s to run
over all the particulars of a long trial: It will be &s;uf|ficient
to &s;ay, that Bedloe's evidence and Prance's were
in many circum&s;tances totally irreconcileable; that both
of them laboured under un&s;urmountable difficulties, not
to &s;ay gro&s;s ab&s;urdities; and that they were invalidated
by contrary evidence, which is altogether convincing.
But all was in vain. The pri&s;oners were condemned
and executed.<NOTE PLACE="marg">February 21st and 28th.</NOTE> They all denied their guilt at their exe|cution;
and as Berry died a Prote&s;tant, this circum|&s;tance
was regarded as very con&s;iderable: But in&s;tead of
giving &s;ome check to the general credulity of the people,
men were only &s;urprized, that a Prote&s;tant could be
induced at his death to per&s;i&s;t in &s;o manife&s;t a fal&s;hood.</P>
<P>AS the army could neither be kept up, nor di&s;banded
without money, the King, however little hopes he
could entertain of more compliance, found him&s;elf
obliged to &s;ummon a new Parliament. The blood, al|ready
&s;hed on account of the popi&s;h plot, in&s;tead of
&s;atiating the people,<NOTE PLACE="marg">New elec|tions.</NOTE> &s;erved only as an incentive to their
fury; and each conviction of a criminal was hitherto
regarded as a new proof of tho&s;e horrible de&s;igns, a&s;cribed
to the Papi&s;ts&punc; This election is perhaps the fir&s;t in
England, which, &s;ince the commencement of the Mo|narchy,
had been carried on by a violent conte&s;t be|tween
the parties, and where the court intere&s;ted it&s;elf,

to a high degree, in the choice of the national repre&s;en|tatives.
But all its efforts were fruitle&s;s, in oppo&s;ition
to the torrent of prejudices, which prevailed. Religion,
liberty, property, even the lives of men were now &s;up|po&s;ed to be at &s;take; and no &s;ecurity, it was thought,
except in a vigilant Parliament, could be found again&s;t
the impious and bloody con&s;pirators. Were there any
part of the nation, to which the ferment, occa&s;ioned by
the popi&s;h plot, had not as yet propagated it&s;elf; the
new elections, by intere&s;ting the whole people in na|tional
concerns, tended to diffu&s;e it into the remote&s;t
corner; and the con&s;ternation, univer&s;ally excited,
proved an excellent engine for influencing the electors.
All the zealots of the former Parliament were re-cho&s;en:
New ones were added: The Pre&s;byterians in particular,
being tran&s;ported with the mo&s;t inveterate antipathy again&s;t
popery, were very active and very &s;ucce&s;sful in the elec|tions.
That party, it is &s;aid, fir&s;t began at this time
the abu&s;e of &s;plitting their freeholds, in order to multi|ply
the votes of electors. By accounts, which came
from every part of England, it was concluded, that the
new repre&s;entatives would, if po&s;&s;ible, exceed the old
in their refractory oppo&s;ition to the court, and furious
per&s;ecution of the Catholics.</P>
<P>THE King was alarmed, when he &s;aw &s;o dreadful a
tempe&s;t ari&s;e from &s;uch &s;mall and unaccountable begin|nings.
His life, if Oates and Bedloe's information was
true, had been aimed at by the Catholics: Even the
Duke's was in danger: The higher, therefore, the rage
mounted again&s;t popery, the more &s;hould the nation
have been reconciled to the&s;e two princes, in whom,
it appeared, the church of Rome repo&s;ed no confidence.
But there is a &s;ophi&s;try, which attends all the pa&s;&s;ions;
e&s;pecially tho&s;e into which the populace enter. Men
gave credit to the informers, &s;o far as concerned the
guilt of the Catholics: But they &s;till retained their old
<PB N="93" REF="123">
&s;u&s;picions, that the&s;e religioni&s;ts were &s;ecretly favoured
by the King, and had obtained the mo&s;t entire a&s;cendant
over his brother. Charles had too much penetration not
to &s;ee the danger, to which the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and even his
own crown and dignity, now &s;tood expo&s;ed A nume|rous
party, he found, was formed again&s;t him; on the
one hand, compo&s;ed of a populace, &s;o credulous from
prejudice, &s;o blinded with religious antipathy, as impli|citly
to believe the mo&s;t palpable ab&s;urdities; and con|ducted,
on the other hand, by leaders &s;o little &s;crupu|lous,
as to endeavour, by encouraging perjury, &s;ubor|nation,
lyes, impo&s;tures; and even by &s;hedding innocent
blood, to gratify their own furious ambition, and &s;ub|vert
all legal authority. Rouzed from his lethargy by
&s;o imminent a peril, he began to exert that vigour of
mind, of which on great occa&s;ions he was not de&s;titute;
and without quitting in appearance his u&s;ual facility of tem|per,
he collected an indu&s;try, firmne&s;s, vigilance, of which he
was believed altogether incapable. The&s;e qualities, joined
to dexterity and judgment, conducted him happily thro'
the many &s;hoals, which &s;urrounded him; and he was at
la&s;t able to make the &s;torm fall on the heads of tho&s;e who
had blindly rai&s;ed, or artificially conducted it.</P>
<P>ONE chief &s;tep, which the King; took, towards grati|fying
and appea&s;ing his people and Parliament, was, de|&s;iring
the Duke to withdraw beyond &s;ea, that no far|ther
&s;u&s;picion might remain of the influence of popi&s;h
councils. The Duke readily complied; but fir&s;t re|quired
an order for that purpo&s;e, &s;igned by the King
le&s;t his ab&s;ence &s;hould be interpreted as a proof of fear
or of guilt. He al&s;o de&s;ired, that his brother &s;hould
&s;atisfy him, as well as the public, by a public decla|ration
of the illegitimacy of the Duke of Monmouth.</P>
<P>JAMES Duke of Monmouth was the King's natural
&s;on by Lucy Walters,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of Monmouth.</NOTE> and born about ten years before
the re&s;toration. He po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the qualities, which
<PB N="94" REF="124">
could engage the affections of the populace; a di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
valour, an affable-addre&s;s, a thoughtle&s;s genero&s;ity
a graceful per&s;on. He ro&s;e &s;till higher in the public fa|vour,
by rea&s;on of the univer&s;al hatred, to which the
Duke, on account of his religion, was expo&s;ed. Mon|mouth's
capacity was mean; his temper pliant: So that
notwith&s;tanding his great popularity, he had never been
dangerous, had he not implicitly re&s;igned him&s;elf over
to the guidance of Shafte&s;bury, a man of &s;uch a re&s;tle&s;s
temper, &s;uch &s;ubtle wit, and &s;uch abandoned principles.
That daring politician had flattered Monmouth with the
hopes of &s;ucceeding to the crown. The &s;tory of a con|tract
of marriage, pa&s;&s;ed between the King and Mon|mouth's
mother, and &s;ecretly kept in a certain <HI>black box;</HI>
had been indu&s;triou&s;ly &s;pread abroad, and was greedily
received by the multitude. As the horrors of popery &s;till
pre&s;&s;ed harder on them, they might be induced, either
to adopt that fiction, as they had already done many
others more incredible, or to commit open violation on
the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. And it would not be difficult, it
was hoped to per&s;uade the King, who was extremely fond
of his &s;on, to give him the preference above a brother,
who by his imprudent bigotry, had involved him in &s;uch
inextricable difficulties. But Charles, in order to cut off
all &s;uch expectations, as well as to remove the Duke's
apprehen&s;ions, took care, in full council, to declare
Monmouth's illegitimacy, and to deny all promi&s;e of
marriage to his mother.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Duke of York retires to Bru&s;&s;els.</NOTE> The Duke, being gratify'd in

<PB N="95" REF="125">
appeared in the fir&s;t &s;tep, which they took upon
their a&s;&s;embling. It had ever been u&s;ual for the Com|mons,
in the election of their &s;peaker, to con&s;ult the
inclinations of the Sovereign; and even the long Par|liament
in 1641 had not thought proper to depart from
&s;o e&s;tabli&s;hed a cu&s;tom. The King now de&s;ired, that
the choice &s;hould fall on Sir Thomas Meres; But Sey|mour,
&s;peaker to the la&s;t Parliament, was in&s;tantly
called to the chair, by a vote which &s;eemed unanimous.
The King, when Seymour was pre&s;ented to him for his
approbation, rejected him, and ordered the Commons
to proceed to a new choice. A great flame was ex|cited.
The Commons maintained, that the King's ap|probation
was merely a form, and that he could not,
without giving a rea&s;on&punc; reject the &s;peaker cho&s;en: The
King, that, &s;ince he had the power of rejecting, he
might, if he plea&s;ed, keep the rea&s;on in his own brea&s;t.
As the que&s;tion had never before been &s;tarted, it might
&s;eem difficult to find principles, upon which it could be
decided<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">In 1566, the Speaker &s;aid to Q. Elizabeth, that without her allowance the election of the hou&s;e was of no &s;ignificance. D'Ewes's Journal, p. 97.

and the election was ratified by the King. It has ever
&s;ince been under&s;tood, that the choice of the &s;peaker lies
in the Hou&s;e; but that the King retains the Power of
rejecting any one di&s;agreeable to him.</P>
<P>SEYMOUR was deemed a great enemy to Danby; and
it was the influence of that nobleman, as commonly &s;up|po&s;ed,
which had engaged the King to enter into this ill|time
controver&s;y with the Commons. The impeach|ment,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Danby's impeach|ment.</NOTE> therefore, of Danby was on that account the
<PB N="96" REF="126">
&s;ooner revived; and it was maintained by the Com|mons,
that, notwith&s;tanding the intervening di&s;&s;olution,
every part of that procedure &s;tood in the &s;ame condition
in which it had been left by the la&s;t Parliament: A pre|ten&s;ion
which, tho' unu&s;ual, &s;eems tacitly to have been
yielded them. The King had before hand had the pre|caution
to grant a pardon to Danby; and, in order to
&s;creen the chancellor from all attacks by the Commons,
he had taken the &s;eal into his own hand, and had him|&s;elf
affixed it to the parchment. He told the Parliament,
that as Danby had acted in every thing by his orders, he
was no wife criminal; that his pardon, however, he
would in&s;i&s;t upon; and if it &s;hould be found any way de|fective
in form, he would renew it again and again, till
it &s;hould be rendered entirely compleat: But that he
was re&s;olved to deprive him of all employments, and to
remove him from court.</P>
<P>The Commons were no wi&s;e &s;ati&s;fied with this con|ce&s;&s;ion.
They pretended that no pardon of the Crown
could be pleaded in bar of an impeachment by the Com|mons.
The prerogative of mercy had been hitherto un|der&s;tood
to be altogether unlimited in the king; and
this preten&s;ion of the Commons, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed,
was entirely new. It was however very &s;uitable to the
genius of a Monarchy, &s;trictly limited; where the
King's mini&s;ters are &s;uppo&s;ed to be for ever accountable
to national a&s;&s;emblies, even for &s;uch abu&s;es of power as
they may commit by orders from their ma&s;ter. The pre|&s;ent
emergence, while the nation was &s;o highly inflamed,
was the proper time for pu&s;hing &s;uch popular claims;
and the Commons failed not to avail them&s;elves of this
advantage. They &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on the impeachment of
Danby. The Peers, in compliance with them, depart|ed
from their former &s;cruples, and ordered Danby to be
taken into cu&s;tody. Danby withdrew. The Commons
pa&s;&s;ed a bill, appointing him to &s;urrender him&s;elf before
<PB N="97" REF="127">
a certain day, or, in default of it, attainting him. A
bill had pa&s;&s;ed the upper Hou&s;e, mitigating the penalty
to bani&s;hment; but after &s;ome conferences, the Peers
thought proper to yield to the violence of the Commons;
and the bill of attainder was carried. Rather than un|dergo
&s;uch &s;evere penalties, Danby appeared, and was
immediately committed to the Tower.</P>
<P>WHILE a prote&s;tant nobleman met with &s;uch &s;evere
pro&s;ecution, it was not likely that the Catholics would
be over-looked by the zealous Commons. The credit
of the popi&s;h plot &s;till &s;tood upon the oaths of a few in|famous
witne&s;&s;es.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Popi&s;h plot.</NOTE> Tho' &s;uch immen&s;e preparations
were &s;uppo&s;ed to have been made in the very bowels of
the kingdom, no traces of them, after the mo&s;t rigorous
enquiry, had as yet appeared. Tho' &s;o many thou&s;ands,
both abroad and at home, had been engaged in the dread|ful
&s;ecret; neither hope, nor fear, nor remor&s;e, nor le|vity,
nor &s;u&s;picions, nor private re&s;entment had engaged
any-one to confirm the evidence. Tho' the Catholics;
particularly the je&s;uits, were repre&s;ented as guilty of the
utmo&s;t indi&s;cretion, in&s;omuch that they talked of the
King's murder as common news, and wrote of it in plain
terms by the common po&s;t; yet, among the great num|ber
of letters &s;eized, no-one contained any part of &s;o
complicated a con&s;piracy. Tho' the informers pretend|ed,
that, even after they had re&s;olved to betray the &s;ecret,
many trea&s;onable commi&s;&s;ions and papers had pa&s;&s;ed thro'
their hands; they had not had the precaution to keep
any one of them, in order to fortify their evidence. But
all the&s;e difficulties, and a thou&s;and more, were not
found too hard of dige&s;tion by the nation and Parliament.
The pro&s;ecution and farther di&s;covery of the plot were
&s;till the object of general concern. The Commons vot|ed,
that, if the King &s;hould come to an untimely end,
they would revenge his death upon the Papi&s;ts; not
reflecting that that &s;ect were not his only enemies.
<PB N="98" REF="128">
They promi&s;ed rewards to new di&s;coverers; not con&s;ider|ing
the danger, which they incurred, of granting bribes
to perjury. They made Bedloe a pre&s;ent of 500 pounds;
and particularly recommended the care of his &s;afety to
the duke of Monmouth. Colonel Sackville, a member,
having, in a private company, &s;poke opprobriou&s;ly of
tho&s;e who affirmed that there was any plot, was expelled
the Hou&s;e. The Peers gave power to their committees
to &s;end for and examine &s;uch as would maintain the in|nocence
of tho&s;e condemned for the plot. A pamphlet
having been publi&s;hed to di&s;credit the informers, and to
vindicate the catholic lords in the Tower, the&s;e lords
were required to di&s;cover the author, and thereby to ex|po&s;e their own advocate to pro&s;ecuation. And both Hou&s;es
concurred in renewing the former vote, that the Papi&s;ts
had undoubtedly entered into a <HI>horrid</HI> and <HI>trea&s;onable</HI> con|&s;piracy
again&s;t the King, the &s;tate, and the prote&s;tant
religion.</P>
<P>IT mu&s;t be owned, that this extreme violence, in pro|&s;ecution
of &s;o ab&s;urd an impo&s;ture, di&s;graces the noble
cau&s;e of liberty, in which the Parliament was engaged.
We may even conclude from &s;uch impatience of contra|diction,
that the pro&s;ecutors them&s;elves retained a &s;ecret
&s;u&s;picion, that the general belief was but ill grounded.
The politicians among them were afraid to let in light,
le&s;t it might put an end to &s;o u&s;eful a delu&s;ion: The
weaker and le&s;s di&s;hone&s;t party took care, by turning their
eyes a&s;ide, not to &s;ee a truth, &s;o oppo&s;ite to tho&s;e furious
pa&s;&s;ions, by which they were actuated, and in which
they were determined ob&s;tinately to per&s;evere.</P>
<P>SIR WILLIAM TEMPLE had been lately recalled from
his foreign employments; and the King, who, after the
removal of Danby, had no one with whom he could &s;o
much as di&s;cour&s;e with freedom of public affairs, was
re&s;olved, upon Coventry's di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, to make him one
of his &s;ecretaries of &s;tate. But that philo&s;ophical patriot,
<PB N="99" REF="129">
too little intere&s;ted for the intrigues of a court, too full
of &s;pleen and delicacy, for the noi&s;y turbulence of po|pular
a&s;&s;emblies, was alarmed at the univer&s;al di&s;con|tents
and jealou&s;ies, which prevailed, and was deter|mined
to make his retreat, as &s;oon as po&s;&s;ible, from a
&s;cene which threatened &s;o much confu&s;ion. Mean-while,
he could not refu&s;e the confidence with which his ma&s;ter
honoured him; and he re&s;olved to employ it to the public
&s;ervice. He repre&s;ented to the King, that, as the jea|lou&s;ies
of the nation were extreme, it was nece&s;&s;ary to
cure them by &s;ome new remedy, and to re&s;tore that con|fidence,
&s;o requi&s;ite for the &s;afety both of King and peo|ple:
That to refu&s;e every thing to the Parliament in their
pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition, or to yield every thing, was equally
dangerous to the con&s;titution and to public tranquillity:
That if the King would introduce into his councils &s;uch
men as enjoyed the confidence of his people, fewer con|ce&s;&s;ions
would probably be required; or if exorbitant de|mands
were made, the King, under the &s;anction of &s;uch
coun&s;ellors, might be enabled, with the greater &s;afety, to
refu&s;e them: And that the heads of the popular party,
being gratified with the King's favour, would probably
abate of that violence, by which they endeavoured at
pre&s;ent to pay court to the multitude.</P>
<P>THE King a&s;&s;ented to all the&s;e rea&s;ons; and, in con|cert
with Temple, he laid the plan of a new privy-coun|cil,
without who&s;e advice he declared him&s;elf determined
for the future to take no mea&s;ures of importance. This
council was to con&s;i&s;t of thirty per&s;ons, and was never
to exceed that number. Fifteen of the chief officers of
the crown were to be continued, who, it was &s;uppo&s;ed,
would adhere to the King, and, in ca&s;e of any extre|mity,
oppo&s;e the exorbitancies of &s;action. The other
part of the council was to be compo&s;ed, either of men of
character, detached from the court, or of tho&s;e who po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
chief credit in both Hou&s;es. And the King, in
<PB N="100" REF="130">
filling up the names of his new council, was glad to find,
that the members, in land and offices, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to the
amount of 300,000 pounds a year; a &s;um nearly equal
to the whole property of the Hou&s;e of Commons, again&s;t
who&s;e violence the new council was intended as a barrier
to the throne<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Their names were: Prince Rupert, the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, lord Finch chancellor, earl of Shafte&s;bury, pre&s;ident, earl of Angle|&s;ea, privy &s;eal, duke of Albemarle, duke of Monmouth, duke of Newea&s;tle, duke of Lauderdale, duke of Ormond, marque&s;s of Winche&s;ter, marque&s;s of Worce&s;ter, earl of Arlington, earl of Sali&s;bury, earl of Bridgwa$$$ earl of Sunderland, earl of E&s;&s;ex, earl of Bath, vi&s;count Falconberg, vi&s;count Halifax, bi&s;hop of London, lord Robarts, lord Hollis, lord Ru&s;&s;el, lord Cavendi&s;h, &s;ecretary Coventry, Sir Francis North, chief ju&s;tice, Sir Henry Capel, Sir John Erneley, Sir Thomas Chichely, Sir William Tem|ple, Edward Seymour, Henry Powle.</NOTE></P>
<P>THIS experiment was tried, and &s;eemed at fir&s;t to
give &s;ome &s;atisfaction to the public. The earl of E&s;&s;ex,
a nobleman of the popular party, &s;on to that lord Capel
who had been beheaded a little after the late King, was
made trea&s;ure in place of Danby. The earl of Sunder|land,
a man of intrigue and great capacity, was made
&s;ecretary of &s;tate: the vi&s;count Halifax, a fine genius,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of learning, eloquence, indu&s;try, but &s;ubject to
inquietude, and fond of refinements, was admitted into
the council. The&s;e three, together with Temple, who
often joined them, though he kept him&s;elf more detached
from public bu&s;ine&s;s, formed a kind of cabinet council,
from which all affairs received their fir&s;t dige&s;tion. Shaf|te&s;bury
was made pre&s;ident of the council; contrary to
the advice of Temple, who foretold the con&s;equence of
admitting a man of &s;o dangerous a character into any
part of the public admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>As Temple fore&s;aw, it happened. Shafte&s;bury, find|ing
that he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no more than the appearance of
court-favour, was re&s;olved &s;till to adhere to the popular
<PB N="101" REF="131">
party, by who&s;e confidence he enjoyed an undi&s;puted &s;u|periority
in the lower Hou&s;e, and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed great influence
over the other. The very appearance of court-favour,
empty as it was, tended to render him more dangerous.
His partizans, ob&s;erving the progre&s;s which he had alrea|dy
made, hoped, that he would &s;oon acquire the entire
a&s;cendant; and he con&s;tantly flattered them, that, if
they per&s;i&s;ted in their purpo&s;es, the King, from indo|lence,
and nece&s;&s;ity, and fondne&s;s for Monmouth, would
at la&s;t be induced, even at the expence of his brother's
right, to make them every conce&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>BESIDES, the antipathy to popery, as well as jealou&s;y
of the King and Duke, had taken too fa&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
men's minds, to be removed by &s;o feeble a remedy, as
this new council, projected by Temple. The Com|mons,
&s;oon after the declaration of that council, pro|ceeded
&s;o far as to vote unanimou&s;ly, &startq;That the Duke of
York's being a papi&s;t, and the hopes of his coming to
the crown, had given the highe&s;t countenance to the
pre&s;ent con&s;piracies and de&s;igns of the papi&s;ts again&s;t
the king and the prote&s;tant religion.&endq; It was expected,
that a bill for excluding him the throne would &s;oon be
brought in. To prevent this bold mea&s;ure, the King
concerted &s;ome limitations, which he propo&s;ed to the
Parliament. He introduced his plan by the following
gracious expre&s;&s;ions: &startq;And to &s;hew you, that, while
you are doing your parts, my thoughts have not been
mi&s;employed, but that it is my con&s;tant care to do every
thing, that may pre&s;erve your religion, and &s;ecure it
for the future in all events, I have commanded my lord
chancellor to mention &s;everal particulars; which, I
hope, will be an evidence, that, in all things, which
concern the public &s;ecurity, I &s;hall not follow your
zeal, but lead it.&endq;</P>
<P>THE limitations projected were of the utmo&s;t impor|tance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Limitations on a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</NOTE>
and deprived the &s;ucce&s;&s;or of the chief branches

of royalty. A method was there chalked out, by which
the nation, on every new reign, could be en&s;ured of
having a Parliament, which the King &s;hould not, for a
certain time, have it in his power to di&s;&s;olve. In ca&s;e
of a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or, the prince was to forfeit the right
of conferring any eccle&s;ia&s;tical preferments: No member
of the privy council, no judge of the common law or in
chancery, was to be put in or di&s;placed but by con&s;ent of
Parliament: And the &s;ame precaution was extended to
the military part of the government; to the lord lieu|tenant
and deputy lieutenant of the counties, and to all
officers of the navy. The chancellor, of him&s;elf added,
&startq;It is hard to invent another re&s;traint; con&s;idering how
much the revenue will depend upon the con&s;ent of
Parliament, and how impo&s;&s;ible it is to rai&s;e money
without &s;uch con&s;ent. But yet, if any thing el&s;e can
occur to the wi&s;dom of the Parliament, which may
farther &s;ecure religion and liberty again&s;t a popi&s;h &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or,
without defeating the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion it|&s;elf,
his maje&s;ty will readily con&s;ent to it.&startq;</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that, when the&s;e limitations were
fir&s;t laid before the council, Shafte&s;bury and Temple were
the only members, who argued again&s;t them. The rea|&s;ons,
which they employed, were diametrically oppo&s;ite.
Shafte&s;bury's opinion was, that the re&s;traints were in&s;uf|ficient;
and that nothing but the total exclu&s;ion of the
duke could give a proper &s;ecurity to the kingdom. Tem|ple
on the other hand thought, that the re&s;traints were
&s;o rigorous as even to &s;ubvert the con&s;titution; and that
&s;hackles, put upon a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or, would not after|wards
be ea&s;ily ca&s;t off by a prote&s;tant. It is certain,
that the Duke was extremely alarmed when he heard of
this &s;tep taken by the King, and that he was better
plea&s;ed even with the bill of exclu&s;ion it&s;elf, which, he
thought, by rea&s;on of its violence and inju&s;tice, could
never po&s;&s;ibly take place. There is al&s;o rea&s;on to be|lieve,
<PB N="103" REF="135">
that the King would not have gone &s;o far, had he
not expected from the extreme fury of the Commons,
that his conce&s;&s;ions would be rejected, and that the blame
of not forming a rea&s;onable accommodation would by
that means lie entirely at their door.</P>
<P>IT &s;oon appeared, that Charles had entertained a ju&s;t
opinion of the di&s;po&s;ition of the Hou&s;e. So much were
the Commons actuated by the cabals of Shafte&s;bury and
other malecontents; &s;uch violent antipathy prevailed
again&s;t popery, that the King's conce&s;&s;ions, tho' much more
important than could rea&s;onably have been expected,
were not embraced.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Bill of ex|clu&s;ion.</NOTE> A bill was brought in for the total
exclu&s;ion of the Duke from the crown of England and
Ireland. It was declared that the &s;overeignty of the&s;e
kingdoms, upon the King's death or re&s;ignation, &s;hould
devolve to the per&s;on next in &s;ucce&s;&s;ion after the Duke;
that all acts of royalty, which that Prince &s;hould after|wards
perform, &s;hould not only be void, but be deemed
trea&s;on; and that if he &s;o much as entered any of the&s;e
dominions, he &s;hould be deemed guilty of the &s;ame of|fence;
and that all who &s;upported his title, &s;hould be
puni&s;hed as rebels and traitors. This important bill,
which implied bani&s;hment as well as exclu&s;ion, pa&s;&s;ed
the lower Hou&s;e by a majority of &s;eventy-nine.</P>
<P>THE Commons were not &s;o wholly employed about
the exclu&s;ion-bill as to overlook all other &s;ecurities to li|berty.
The country party, during all the la&s;t Parlia|ment,
had exclaimed much again&s;t the bribery and cor|ruption
of the members: and the &s;ame reproach had
been renewed again&s;t the pre&s;ent Parliament. An en|quiry
was made into a complaint, which was &s;o dange|rous
to the honour of that a&s;&s;embly; but very little foun|dation
was found for it. Sir Stephen Fox, who was the
pay-ma&s;ter, confe&s;&s;ed to the Hou&s;e, that nine members
received pen&s;ions to the amount of three thou&s;and four
hundred pounds: And after a very rigorous enquiry by
<PB N="104" REF="136">
a &s;ecret committee, eight more pen&s;ioners were di&s;covered.
A &s;um al&s;o, about twelve thou&s;and pounds, had been
occa&s;ionally given or lent to others. The writers
of that age pretend, that Clifford and Danby had
adopted very oppo&s;ite maxims with regard to pecu|niary
influence. The former endeavoured to gain the
leaders and orators of the Hou&s;e, and deemed the others
of no con&s;equence. The latter thought it &s;ufficient to
gain a majority, however compo&s;ed. It is likely, that
the means, rather than the intentions, were wanting to
both the&s;e mini&s;ters.</P>
<P>PENSIONS and bribes, tho' it be difficult entirely to
exclude them, are dangerous expedients for government;
and cannot be too carefully guarded again&s;t, nor too ve|hemently
decried by every one who has a regard to the
virtue and liberty of a nation. The influence, however,
which the Crown acquires from the di&s;po&s;al of places,
honours, and preferments, is to be e&s;teemed of a diffe|rent
nature. This engine of power may become too
forcible, but it cannot altogether be aboli&s;hed, without
the total de&s;truction of monarchy, and even of all regu|lar
authority. But the Commons at this time were &s;o
jealous of the Crown, that they brought in a bill, which
was twice read, excluding from the lower Hou&s;e all
who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any lucrative offices.</P>
<P>THE &s;tanding army and the King's guards were by
the Commons voted to be illegal: A new preten&s;ion, it
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed; but very nece&s;&s;ary for the full &s;ecurity
of liberty and a limited con&s;titution.</P>
<P>ARBITRARY impri&s;onment is a grievance,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Habeas cor|pus bill.</NOTE> which, in
&s;ome degree, has place almo&s;t in every government, ex|cept
in that of Britain; and our ab&s;olute &s;ecurity from
it we owe chiefly to the pre&s;ent Parliament; a merit,
which makes great atonement for the faction and violence,
into which their prejudices had, in other particulars, be|trayed
them. The great charter had laid the foundation
<PB N="105" REF="137">
of this valuable part of liberty; the petition of right had
renewed and extended it; but many provi&s;ions were &s;till
wanting, to render it complete, and prevent all eva&s;ion
or delay from mini&s;ters and judges. The act of <HI>habeas
corpus,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed this &s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;erved the&s;e u&s;eful purpo&s;es.
By this act, it was prohibited to &s;end any one to pri&s;ons
beyond &s;ea. No judge, under &s;evere penalties, mu&s;t re|fu&s;e
to any pri&s;oner a writ of <HI>habeas corpus,</HI> by which the
gaoler was directed to produce in court the body of the
pri&s;oner (whence the writ has its name) and to certify
the cau&s;e of his detainer and impri&s;onment. If the
gaol lay within twenty miles of the judge, the writ mu&s;t
be obeyed in three days; and &s;o proportionably for
greater di&s;tances: Every pri&s;oner mu&s;t be indicted the
fir&s;t term after his commitment, and brought to trial in
the &s;ub&s;equent term. And no man, after being enlarged
by order of court, can be recommitted for the &s;ame of|fence.
This law is e&s;&s;entially nece&s;&s;ary for the pro|tection
of liberty in a mixed monarchy; and as it has
not place in any other form of government, this con&s;i|deration
alone may induce us to prefer our pre&s;ent con|&s;titution
to all others. It mu&s;t, however, be confe&s;&s;ed,
that there is &s;ome difficulty to reconcile with &s;uch extreme
liberty the regular police of a &s;tate, e&s;pecially that of
great cities.</P>
<P>DURING the&s;e zealous efforts for the protection of li|berty,
no complai&s;ance for the Crown was di&s;covered
by this Parliament. The King's revenue lay under great
debts and anticipations: Tho&s;e branches, granted in the
years 1669 and 1670, were ready to expire: And the
fleet was repre&s;ented by the King to be in great decay
and di&s;order. But the Commons, in&s;tead of being af|fected
by the&s;e di&s;tre&s;&s;es of the Crown, tru&s;ted chiefly to
them for pa&s;&s;ing the exclu&s;ion-bill, and for puni&s;hing
and di&s;placing all the mini&s;ters, who were di&s;agreeable
to them. They were therefore in no ha&s;te to relieve the
<PB N="106" REF="138">
King; and grew only the more a&s;&s;uming on account of
his complaints and unea&s;ine&s;s. Jealous however of the
army, they granted the &s;ame &s;um of 206,000 pounds,
which had been voted for di&s;banding it by the la&s;t Par|liament;
tho' the vote, by rea&s;on of the &s;ub&s;equent pro|rogation
and di&s;&s;olution, joined to &s;ome &s;cruples of the
Lords, had not been carried into an act. This money
was appropriated by very &s;trict clau&s;es; but the Com|mons
in&s;i&s;ted not as formerly upon its being paid into the
chamber of London.</P>
<P>THE impeachment of the five popi&s;h lords in the
Tower, with that of the earl of Danby, was carried on
with great vigour. The power of that mini&s;ter and his
credit with the King, made him extremely obnoxious
to the popular leaders; and the Commons hoped, that
if he was pu&s;h'd to extremity, he would be obliged, in
order to ju&s;tify his own conduct, to lay open the whole
intrigue of the French alliance, which they &s;u&s;pected to
contain a &s;ecret of the mo&s;t dangerous nature. The King
on his &s;ide, apprehen&s;ive of the &s;ame con&s;equences, and
de&s;irous to protect his mini&s;ter, who was become crimi|nal
merely by obeying orders, employed his whole inte|re&s;t
to &s;upport the validity of that pardon, which had
been granted him. The Lords appointed a day for the
examination of this que&s;tion, and agreed to hear coun|cil
on both &s;ides: But the Commons would not &s;ubmit
their preten&s;ions to the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion of argument and en|quiry.
They voted, that whoever &s;hould pre&s;ume,
without their leave, to maintain before the Hou&s;e
of Peers the validity of Danby's pardon, &s;hould be ac|counted
a betrayer of the liberties of the Engli&s;h Com|mons.
And they made a demand, that the bi&s;hops,
whom they knew to be devoted to the court, &s;hould be
removed, not only when the trial of the earl &s;hould come
on, but al&s;o when the validity of his pardon &s;hould be
di&s;cu&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P><PB N="107" REF="139">
THE bi&s;hops before the reformation had always en|joyed
a &s;eat in Parliament: But &s;o far were they anti|ently
from regarding that dignity as a privilege, that they
affected rather to form a &s;eparate order in the &s;tate, quite
independant of the civil magi&s;trate, and accountable
only to the pope and to their own order. By the con&s;ti|tutions,
however, of Clarendon, enacted during the
reign of Henry II. they were obliged to give their pre|&s;ence
in Parliament; but as the canon law prohibited
them from a&s;&s;i&s;ting in the trials of life and death, they
were allowed in &s;uch ca&s;es the privilege of ab&s;enting
them&s;elves. A practice, which was at fir&s;t merely vo|luntary,
became afterwards a rule; and on the earl of
Strafford's trial, the bi&s;hops, who would gladly have at|tended,
and who were no longer bound by the canon-law,
were yet obliged to withdraw. It had always been
u&s;ual for them to enter a prote&s;tation of their right to
fit; and this prote&s;tation, being con&s;idered as a mere
form, was always admitted and di&s;regarded. But here
was &s;tarted a new que&s;tion of no &s;mall importance. The
Commons, who were now enabled, by the violence of
the people, and the nece&s;&s;ities of the crown, to make
new acqui&s;itions of powers and privileges, in&s;i&s;ted, that
the bi&s;hops had no more title to vote in the que&s;tion of
the earl's pardon than in the impeachment it&s;elf. The
bi&s;hops a&s;&s;erted, that the pardon was merely a prelimi|nary;
and that, neither by the canon-law nor the prac|tice
of Parliament, were they ever obliged, in capital
ca&s;es, to remove, till the very commencement of the
trial it&s;elf. If their ab&s;ence was con&s;idered as a privilege,
which was its real origin, it depended on their own
choice, how far they would in&s;i&s;t upon it. If regarded
as a diminution of their right of peerage, &s;uch unfavou|rable
cu&s;toms ought never to be extended beyond the very
circum&s;tance e&s;tabli&s;hed by them; and all arguments,
from a pretended parity of rea&s;on, were in that ca&s;e of
little or no authority.</P>
<P><PB N="108" REF="140">
THE Hou&s;e of Lords were &s;o much influenced by
the&s;e rea&s;ons, that they admitted the bi&s;hops' right to
vote, when the validity of the pardon &s;hould be exa|mined.
The Commons in&s;i&s;ted &s;till on their withdraw|ing;
and thus a quarrel being commenced between the
two Hou&s;es, the King, who expected nothing but fre&s;h
in&s;tances of violence from this Parliament, began to en|tertain
thoughts of laying hold of &s;o favourable a pre|tence,
and of fini&s;hing the &s;e&s;&s;ion by a prorogation.
While in this di&s;po&s;ition, he was alarmed with &s;udden
intelligence, that the Hou&s;e of Commons were preparing
a remon&s;trance, in order to inflame the nation &s;till far|ther
upon the favourite topics of the plot and of popery.
He ha&s;tened,<NOTE PLACE="marg">27th of May.</NOTE> therefore, to execute his intention, even
without con&s;ulting his new council, by who&s;e advice he
had promi&s;ed to regulate his whole conduct. And thus
were di&s;appointed all the projects of the malecontents,
whe were extremely enraged at this vigorous mea&s;ure
of the King. Shafte&s;bury publicly threatened, that he
would have the head of whoever had advi&s;ed it. The
Parliament was &s;oon after di&s;&s;olved without advice of
council;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prorogation and di&s;&s;o|lution of the Parlia|ment.</NOTE> and a new Parliament ordered to be cho&s;en.
The King was willing to try every means, which gave
a pro&s;pect of more compliance in his &s;ubjects;<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of July.</NOTE> and, in
ca&s;e of failure, the blame, he hoped, would lie on tho&s;e
who&s;e ob&s;tinacy forced him to extremities.</P>
<P>BUT even during the rece&s;s of Parliament, there was
no interruption to the pro&s;ecution of the Catholics ac|cu&s;ed
of the plot. The King, contrary to his own judg|ment,
found him&s;elf obliged to give way to this popular
fury. Whitebread, provincial of the je&s;uits, Fenwic,
Gavan, Turner, and Harcourt, all of them of the &s;ame
order,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial and execution of the five je|&s;uits.</NOTE> were fir&s;t brought to their trial. Be&s;ides Oates
and Bedloe, Dugdale, a new witne&s;s, appeared again&s;t
the pri&s;oners. This man had been &s;teward to lord
A&s;ton, and, tho' poor, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;omewhat a more repu|table
<PB N="109" REF="141">
character than the other two: But his account of
the intended ma&s;&s;acres and a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inations was equally
mon&s;trous and incredible. He even a&s;&s;erted, that 200,000
Papi&s;ts in England were ready to take arms. The pri|&s;oners
proved by &s;ixteen witne&s;&s;es from St. Omer's,
&s;tudents and mo&s;t of them young men of family,
that Oates was in that &s;eminary, at the time when he
&s;wore that he was in London: But as they were Catho|lics
and di&s;ciples of the je&s;uits, their te&s;timony, both
with the judges and the jury, was totally di&s;regarded.
Even the reception, which they met with in court, was
full of outrage and mockery. One of them &s;aying, that
Oates always continued at St. Omer's, if he could believe
his &s;en&s;es: &startq;You Papi&s;ts,&endq; &s;aid the chief ju&s;tice, &startq;are
taught not to believe your &s;en&s;es.&endq; It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that Oates, in oppo&s;ition to the &s;tudents of St.
Omer's, found means to bring evidence of his having
been at that time in London: But this evidence, tho' it
had, at the time, the appearance of &s;ome &s;olidity, was
afterwards di&s;covered, when Oates him&s;elf was tried for
perjury, to be altogether deceitful. In order farther
to di&s;credit that witne&s;s, the je&s;uits proved by undoubt|ed
te&s;timony, that he had perjured him&s;elf in father Ire|land's
trial, whom they &s;hewed to have been in Stafford|&s;hir
at the very time when Oates &s;wore, that he was
committing trea&s;on in London. But all the&s;e pleas
availed them nothing again&s;t the general prejudices.
They received &s;entence of death; and were executed,
per&s;i&s;ting to their la&s;t breath in the mo&s;t &s;olemn, earne&s;t,
and deliberate, tho' di&s;regarded prote&s;tations of their
innocence.</P>
<P>THE next trial was that of Langhorne,<NOTE PLACE="marg">And of Langhorne.</NOTE> an eminent
lawyer, by whom all the concerns of the je&s;uits were
managed. Thro' his hands, Oates and Bedloe &s;wore,
all the papal commi&s;&s;ions pa&s;&s;ed; by which the chief of|fices
in England were &s;upplied with Catholics. When
<PB N="110" REF="142">
verdict was given again&s;t the pri&s;oner, the audience ex|pre&s;&s;ed
their &s;avage joy by loud acclamations. So high
indeed had the popular rage mounted, that the witne&s;&s;es
for this unhappy man, on approaching the court, were
almo&s;t torne in pieces by the rabble: One in particular
was brui&s;ed to &s;uch a degree, as to put his life in danger.
And another, a woman, declared, that, unle&s;s the court
could afford her protection, &s;he dur&s;t not give evidence:
But as the judges could go no farther than promi&s;e to pu|ni&s;h
&s;uch as &s;hould injure her, the pri&s;oner him&s;elf had
the humanity to wave her te&s;timony.</P>
<P>So far the informers had proceeded with &s;ucce&s;s:
Their accu&s;ation was hitherto equivalent to a &s;entence of
death.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Wakeman acquitted.</NOTE> The fir&s;t check, which they received, was on
the trial of Sir George Wakeman the Queen's phy&s;ician,<NOTE PLACE="marg">18th of July.</NOTE>
whom they accu&s;ed of an intention to poi&s;on the King.
It was a &s;trong circum&s;tance in favour of Wakeman,
that Oates, in his fir&s;t information before the council,
had accu&s;ed him only upon hear&s;ay; and when a&s;ked by
the chancellor, whether he had any thing farther to
charge him with, he added, &startq;God forbid I &s;hould &s;ay
any thing again&s;t Sir George: For I know nothing
more again&s;t him.&endq; On the trial he gave po&s;itive
evidence of the pri&s;oner's guilt. There were many
other circum&s;tances which favoured Wakeman: But
what chiefly contributed to his acquittal, was the con|nexion
of his cau&s;e with that of the Queen, whom no|one,
even during the highe&s;t prejudices of the times,
could &s;incerely believe guilty. The great importance
of the trial made men recollect them&s;elves, and recall that
good &s;en&s;e and humanity, which &s;eemed during &s;ome|time
to have abandoned the nation. The chief ju&s;tice him|&s;elf,
who had hitherto favoured the witne&s;&s;es, exagge|rated
the plot, and railed again&s;t the pri&s;oners, was ob|&s;erved
to be con&s;iderably mollified, and to give a favour|able
charge to the jury. Oates and Bedloe had the a&s;|&s;urance
<PB N="111" REF="143">
to attack him to his face, and even to accu&s;e
him of partiality before the council. The whole party
who had formerly much extolled his conduct, made him
the great object of their re&s;entment. Wakeman's ac|quittal
was indeed a &s;en&s;ible mortification to the furious
pro&s;ecutors of the plot, and fixed an indelible &s;tain upon
the witne&s;&s;es. But Wakeman, after he recovered his
liberty, finding him&s;elf expo&s;ed to &s;uch inveterate en|mity,
and being threatened with farther pro&s;ecutions,
thought it prudent to retire beyond &s;ea: And his flight
was interpreted as a proof of guilt, by tho&s;e who were
&s;till r&s;olved to per&s;i&s;t in the belief of the con&s;piracy.</P>
<P>THE great di&s;contents in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of af|fairs in Scot|land.</NOTE> and the refractory
di&s;po&s;ition of the Parliament, excited the hopes of the
Scots covenanters, and gave them &s;ome pro&s;pect of an
end to tho&s;e grievous oppre&s;&s;ions, under which they had
&s;o long laboured. It was &s;u&s;pected to have been the po|licy
of Lauderdale and his a&s;&s;ociates to pu&s;h the&s;e un|happy
men to extremity, and force them into rebellion,
with a view of reaping profit from the forfeitures and
attainders, which would en&s;ue upon it. But the co|venanters,
aware of this policy, had hitherto forborne
all acts of ho&s;tility; and that tyrannical mini&s;ter had
failed of his purpo&s;e. An incident at la&s;t happened,
which brought on an in&s;urrection in that country.</P>
<P>THE covenanters were much enraged again&s;t Sharpe,
the primate, whom they con&s;idered as an apo&s;tate from
their principles, and whom they experienced to be an
unrelenting per&s;ecutor of all tho&s;e who di&s;&s;ented from
the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip. He had an officer under him,
one Carmichael, no le&s;s zealous than him&s;elf again&s;t all
conventicles, and who by his violent pro&s;ecutions had
rendered him&s;elf extremely obnoxious to the fanatics.
A company of the&s;e had way-laid him on the road near<NOTE PLACE="marg">3d of May.</NOTE>
St. Andrews, with an intention, if not of killing him,
at lea&s;t of beating him &s;o &s;everely as would afterwards
<PB N="112" REF="144">
render him more cautious in per&s;ecuting the Non-con|formi&s;ts<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">Wodrow's hi&s;tory of the &s;ufferings of the church of Scotland, vol. ii. p. 28.</NOTE>.
While looking out for their prey, they were
&s;urprized at &s;eeing the archbi&s;hop's coach pa&s;s by; and
they immediately interpreted this incident as a declaration
of the &s;ecret purpo&s;e of Providence again&s;t him. But
when they ob&s;erved, that almo&s;t all his &s;ervants, by
&s;ome accident, were ab&s;ent, they no longer doubted,
that heaven had here delivered their capital enemy into
their hands. Without farther deliberation, they fell
upon him; dragged him from his coach; tore him from
the arms of his daughter, who interpo&s;ed with cries and
tears; and piercing him with redoubled wounds, left
him dead on the &s;pot, and immediately di&s;per&s;ed them|&s;elves.</P>
<P>THIS atrocious action &s;erved the mini&s;try as a pre|tence
for a more violent per&s;ecution again&s;t the fanatics,
on whom, without di&s;tinction, they laid the guilt of
tho&s;e furious a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ins. It is indeed certain, that the mur|der
of Sharpe had excited an univer&s;al joy among the
covenanters, and that their blind zeal had often led
them, in their books and &s;ermons, to prai&s;e and recom|mend
the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of their enemies, whom they con|&s;idered
as the enemies of all true piety and godline&s;s.
The &s;tories of Jael and Si&s;era, of Ehud and Eglon, re|&s;ounded
from every pulpit. The officers, quartered in
the we&s;t, received more &s;trict orders to find out and dis|per&s;e
all conventicles; and for that rea&s;on the covenan|ters,
in&s;tead of meeting in &s;mall bodies, were obliged to
celebrate their wor&s;hip in numerous a&s;&s;emblies, and to
bring arms for their &s;ecurity. At Rutherglen, a &s;mall
borough near Gla&s;gow, they openly &s;et forth a declara|tion
again&s;t prelacy, and in the market-place burned &s;e|veral
acts of Parliament and acts of council, which had
e&s;tabli&s;hed prelacy, and prohibited all conventicles. For
<PB N="113" REF="145">
this in&s;ult on government, they purpo&s;ely cho&s;e the 29th
of May, the anniver&s;ary of the re&s;toration; and previ|ou&s;ly
extingui&s;hed the bonfires, which had been kind|led
for that &s;olemnity.</P>
<P>CAPTAIN Graham, afterwards vi&s;count Dundee, an
active and enterprizing officer, attacked a great conven|ticle
upon Lo$don-hill, and was repul&s;ed with the lo&s;s
of thirty men. The covenanters finding that they were
unwarily involved in &s;uch deep guilt, were engaged to
per&s;evere, and to &s;eek from their valour and fortune alone
for that indemnity, which the &s;everity of the government
left them no hopes of ever being a$$e otherwi&s;e to ob|tain.
They pu&s;hed on to Gla&s;gow, and tho' at fir&s;t re|pu&s;ed,
they afterwards made them&s;elves ma&s;ters of that
town; di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the e&s;tabli&s;hed clergy; and i&s;&s;ued
proclamations, in which they declared, that they fought
again&s;t the King's &s;upremacy, again&s;t popery and prelacy,
and again&s;t a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>HOWEVER accidental this in&s;urrection might appear,
there is rea&s;on to think, that &s;ome great men, in com|bination
with the popular leaders in England, had &s;e|cretly
in&s;tigated the covenanters to proceed to &s;uch ex|tremities<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Algernon Sidney's letters, p. 90.</NOTE>,
and hoped for the &s;ame effects as had forty
years before en&s;ued from the di&s;orders in Scotland.
The King al&s;o, apprehen&s;ive of like con&s;equences, im|mediately
di&s;patched Monmouth with a &s;mall body of
Engli&s;h cavalry. He joined the Scots guards, and &s;ome
regiments of militia, levied from the well affected coun|ties;
and with great celerity marched towards the we&s;t
in que&s;t of the rebels.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Battle of Bothwel-bridge.</NOTE> They had taken po&s;t at Both|wel-bridge
between Hamilton and Gla&s;gow; where
there was no acce&s;s to them but over the bridge, which
a &s;mall body was able to defend again&s;t the King's
forces. They &s;hewed great judgment in the choice of
their po&s;t; but di&s;covered neither judgment nor valour
<PB N="114" REF="146">
in any other &s;tep of their conduct. No nobility and few
gentry had joined them: The mini&s;ters were in reality
the commanders; and the whole army never exceeded
8000 men.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of June.</NOTE> Monmouth attacked the bridge; and the
body of in&s;urgents who defended it, maintained their
po&s;t, as long as their ammunition la&s;ted. When they
&s;ent for more, they received orders to abandon their
ground, and to retire backwards. This imprudent mea|&s;ure
ruined the army of the covenanters. Monmouth
pa&s;&s;ed the bridge without oppo&s;ition, and drew up in or|der,
oppo&s;ite to the enemy. His cannon alone put them
to rout. About 700 $ell in the pur&s;uit: For properly
&s;peaking there was no action. Twelve hundred were
taken pri&s;oners; and were treated by Monmouth with
an humanity, which they had never experienced in their
own countrymen. Such of them as would promi&s;e to
live peaceably under the government were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed.
About three hundred, who were &s;o ob&s;tinate as to refu&s;e
this ea&s;y condition, were &s;hipped for Barbadoes; but
unfortunately peri&s;hed in the voyage. Two of their
clergy were hanged. Monmouth was of a generous di&s;|po&s;ition;
and be&s;ides, aimed at popularity in Scotland.
The King intended to intru&s;t the affairs of that kingdom
into his hands. He had married a Scots lady, heire&s;s
of one of the mo&s;t con&s;iderable families, and allied to
all the chief nobility. And Lauderdale, as he was now
declining in his parts, and was much decayed in his
memory, began to lo&s;e with the King, that influence
which he had maintained during &s;o many years; not|with&s;tanding
all the efforts of his numerous enemies both
in Scotland and England, and notwith&s;tanding the many
violent and tyrannical actions, of which he had been
guilty. Even at pre&s;ent he retained &s;o much influence
as to poi&s;on all the good intentions, which the King,
either of him&s;elf or by Monmouth's &s;ugge&s;tion, had
formed with regard to Scotland. An act of indemnity
<PB N="115" REF="147">
was granted; but the mini&s;ter took care, that it &s;hould
rather afford protection to him&s;elf and his a&s;&s;ociates,
than to the unhappy covenanters. And tho' orders were
given to connive thenceforwards at all conventicles, he
found means, under a variety of pretences, to elude the
execution. It mu&s;t be owned however to his prai&s;e,
that he was the chief per&s;on, who by his council ha&s;tened
the expeditious march of the forces and the prompt or|ders
to Monmouth: and thereby di&s;appointed all the
expectations of the Engli&s;h malecontents, who, reflect|ing
on the di&s;po&s;itions of men's minds in both king|doms,
had entertained great hopes from the progre&s;s of
the Scots in&s;urrection.</P>

others to the popular part of the government. Tho'
the King after his re&s;toration, had endeavoured to abo|li&s;h
the di&s;tinction of parties, and had cho&s;en his mi|ni&s;ters
from among all denominations; no &s;ooner had he
lo&s;t his popularity, and expo&s;ed him&s;elf to general jea|lou&s;y,
than he found it requi&s;ite to court the old cavalier
party, and to promi&s;e them full compen&s;ation for that
neglect, of which they had hitherto complained. The
pre&s;ent emergence made it &s;till more nece&s;&s;ary for him
to apply for their &s;upport; and there were many circum|&s;tances,
which determined them, at this time, to fly to
the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the crown, and to the protection of the
royal family.</P>
<P>A PARTY &s;trongly attached to monarchy will natu|rally
be jealous of the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, by which alone,
they believe, &s;tability to be pre&s;erved in the government,
and a barrier fixed to the encroachments of popular a&s;|&s;emblies.
The project, openly embraced of excluding
the Duke, appeared to that party a dangerous innovation:
And the de&s;ign, &s;ecretly projected, of advancing Mon|mouth,
made them apprehen&s;ive, le&s;t the inconvenien|cies
of a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion &s;hould be propagated to all
po&s;terity. While the jealous lovers of liberty maintained,
that a King, who&s;e title depended on the Parliament,
would naturally be more regardful of the intere&s;ts and
humours of the people; the pa&s;&s;ionate admirers of mo|narchy
<PB N="117" REF="151">
con&s;idered this dependance as a degradation of
kingly government, and a great &s;tep towards the e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
of a commonwealth in England.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the union of the political Royali&s;ts brought
great acce&s;&s;ion of force to the crown, Charles derived
no le&s;s &s;upport from the confederacy, which he had, at
this time, the addre&s;s to form with the church of En|gland.
He repre&s;ented to the church the great number
of Pre&s;byterians and other &s;ectaries, who had entered into
the popular party; the encouragement and favour which
they met with; the loudne&s;s of their cries with regard
to popery and arbitrary power. And he made the e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
clergy and their adherents apprehend, that the
old &s;cheme for the abolition of prelacy as well as mo|narchy
was revived, and that the &s;ame mi&s;eries and
oppre&s;&s;ions threatened them, to which, during the civil
wars and u&s;urpations, they had &s;o long been expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THE memory al&s;o of the&s;e di&s;mal times united many
indifferent and impartial per&s;ons to the Crown, and be|got
a dread, le&s;t the zeal for liberty &s;hould engraft it&s;elf
on fanatici&s;m, and &s;hould once more kindle a civil war
in the kingdom. Had not the King &s;till retained the
prerogative of di&s;&s;olving the Parliament, there was in|deed
rea&s;on to apprehend the renewal of all the preten|&s;ions
and violences, which had u&s;hered in the la&s;t com|motions.
The one period appeared an exact counter|part
to the other: But &s;till di&s;cerning judges could per|ceive,
both in the &s;pirit of the parties and in the genius
of the Prince, a very material difference; by means of
which Charles was enabled at la&s;t, tho' with the immi|nent
peril of liberty, to pre&s;erve the peace of the nation.</P>
<P>THE cry again&s;t popery was very loud; but it pro|ceeded
le&s;s from religious than from party zeal, in tho&s;e
who propagated, and even in tho&s;e who adopted it.
The &s;pirit of enthu&s;ia&s;m had occa&s;ioned &s;o much mi&s;|chief,
and had been &s;o &s;ucce&s;sfully exploded, that it was
<PB N="118" REF="152">
not po&s;&s;ible, by any artifice, again to revive and &s;up|port
it. Cant had been ridiculed; hypocri&s;y detected;
the preten&s;ions to a more thorough reformation, and to
greater purity, had become &s;u&s;picious; and in&s;tead of
denominating them&s;elves the <HI>godly</HI> party, the appellation af|fected
at the beginning of the civil wars, the pre&s;ent pa|triots
were contented to call them&s;elves the <HI>good</HI> and the
<HI>hone&s;t</HI> party<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. i. p. 335.</NOTE>: A &s;ure progno&s;tic, that their mea&s;ures
were not to be &s;o furious, nor their preten&s;ions &s;o exor|bitant.</P>
<P>THE King too, tho' not endowed with the integrity
and &s;trict principles of his father, was happy in a more
amiable manner, and more popular addre&s;s. Far from
being di&s;tant, &s;tately, or re&s;erved, he had not a grain
of pride or vanity in his whole compo&s;ition<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Temple, vol. i. p. 449.</NOTE>; but was
the mo&s;t affable, be&s;t bred man alive. He treated his
&s;ubjects like noblemen, like gentlemen, like freemen;
not like va&s;&s;als or boors. His profe&s;&s;ions were plau&s;ible,
his whole behaviour engaging; &s;o that he won upon the
hearts, even while he lo&s;t the good opinion of his &s;ub|jects,
and often ballanced their judgment of things by
their per&s;onal inclination<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Di&s;|&s;ertation on Parties, letter vii.</NOTE> In his public conduct like|wi&s;e,
tho' he had &s;ometimes embraced mea&s;ures dange|rous
to the liberty and religion of his people, he had
never been found to per&s;evere ob&s;tinately in them, but
had always returned into that path, which their united
opinion &s;eemed to point out to him. And upon the whole,
it &s;eemed to many, cruel and even iniquitous, to re|mark
too rigorou&s;ly the failings of a prince, who di&s;co|vered
&s;o much facility in correcting his errors, and &s;o
much lenity in pardoning the offences committed again&s;t
him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE general affection, which was borne the King,
appeared &s;ignally about this time. He fell &s;ick at Wind|&s;or;
<PB N="119" REF="153">
and had two or three fits of a fever, &s;o violent as made
his life be thought in danger. A general amazement &s;ei|zed
all ranks of men, encrea&s;ed by the apprehen&s;ions en|tertained
of his &s;ucce&s;&s;or. In the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of
men's minds, the King's death, to u&s;e an expre&s;&s;ion of
Sir William Temple<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Vol. i. p. 342.</NOTE>, was regarded as the end of the
world. The malecontents, it was feared, would pro|ceed
to extremities, and immediately kindle a civil war
in the kingdom. Either their entire &s;ucce&s;s, or entire
failure, or even the ballance and conte&s;t of parties, &s;eemed
all of them events equally fatal. The King's chief
coun&s;ellors,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the mini&s;try.</NOTE> therefore, E&s;&s;ex, Halifax, and Sunderland,
who &s;tood on very bad terms with Shafte&s;bury and the
popular party, advi&s;ed him to &s;end &s;ecretly for the Duke,
that, in ca&s;e of any &s;ini&s;ter accident, that Prince might be
ready to a&s;&s;ert his right again&s;t the oppo&s;ition, which
he was likely to meet with. When the Duke arrived,
he found his brother out of danger; and it was agreed to
conceal the invitation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">2d of September.</NOTE> which he had received. His jour|ney,
however, was attended with very important conse|quences.
He prevailed on the King to di&s;grace Mon|mouth,
who&s;e projects were now known and avowed;
to deprive him of his command in the army; and to
&s;end him beyond &s;ea. He him&s;elf returned to Bru&s;&s;els;
but made a very &s;hort &s;tay in that place. He obtained
leave to retire to Scotland, under pretence &s;till of quiet|ing
the apprehen&s;ions of the Engli&s;h nation; but really
with a purpo&s;e of &s;ecuring that kingdom in his intere&s;ts.</P>
<P>THO' E&s;&s;ex and Halifax had concurred in the re&s;olution
of inviting over the Duke, they &s;oon found, that they
had not obtained his confidence, and that even the King,
while he made u&s;e of their &s;ervice, had no &s;incere re|gard
for their per&s;ons. E&s;&s;ex in di&s;gu&s;t re&s;igned the Trea|&s;ury:
Halifax retired to his country-feat: Temple, de|&s;pairing
of any accommodation among &s;uch enraged par|ties,
<PB N="120" REF="154">
withdrew almo&s;t entirely to his books and his gar|dens.
The King, who changed mini&s;ters as well as
mea&s;ures with great indifference, be&s;towed at this time
his chief confidence on Hyde, Sunderland, and Godol|phin.
Hyde &s;ucceeded E&s;&s;ex in the trea&s;ury.</P>
<P>ALL the King's mini&s;ters, as well as him&s;elf, were
extremely aver&s;e to the meeting of the new Parliament,
which they expected to find as refractory as any of the
preceding.
The elections had gone mo&s;tly in favour of
the country party. The terrors of the plot had &s;till
a mighty influence over the populace; and the appre|hen&s;ions
of the Duke's bigotted principles and arbitrary
character, weighed with all men of &s;en&s;e and reflection.
The King therefore re&s;olved to prorogue the Parliament,
that he might try, whether time would allay tho&s;e hu|mours,
which, by every other expedient, he had in vain
attempted to mollify. In this mea&s;ure he did not expect
the concurrence of his council. He knew, that tho&s;e
popular leaders, whom he had admitted, would zealou&s;ly
oppo&s;e a re&s;olution, which di&s;concerted all their &s;chemes;
and that the royali&s;ts would not dare, by &s;upporting it,
to expo&s;e them&s;elves to the vengeance of the Parliament,
when it &s;hould be a&s;&s;embled. The&s;e rea&s;ons obliged him
to take this &s;tep entirely of him&s;elf; and he only decla|red
his re&s;olution in council. It is remarkable, that,
tho' the King had made profe&s;&s;ion never to embrace any
mea&s;ure without advice of his council, he had often
broke that re&s;olution, and had been nece&s;&s;itated in affairs
of the greate&s;t con&s;equence, to controul their opinion.
Many of them in di&s;gu&s;t threw up about this time; par|ticularly
lord Ru&s;&s;el, the mo&s;t popular man in the na|tion,
as well from the mildne&s;s and integrity of his man|ners,
as from his zealous attachment to the religion and
liberties of his country. Tho' carried into &s;ome ex|tremes,
his intentions were ever e&s;teemed upright; and be|ing
heir to the mo&s;t opulent fortune in the kingdom, as
<PB N="121" REF="155">
as void of ambition, men believed, that nothing but
the la&s;t nece&s;&s;ity would ever engage him to embrace any
de&s;perate mea&s;ures. Shafte&s;bury, who was, in mo&s;t par|ticulars,
of an oppo&s;ite character, was removed by the
King from the office of pre&s;ident of the council; and
the earl of Radnor, a man who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed whim&s;ical ta|lents
and &s;plenetic virtues, was &s;ub&s;tituted in his place.</P>
<P>IT was the favour and countenance of the Parliament,
which had chiefly encouraged the rumour of plots; but
the nation had got &s;o much into that vein of credulity,
and every nece&s;&s;itous villain was &s;o much incited by the
&s;ucce&s;s of Oates and Bedloe, that even during the pro|rogation
the people were not allowed to remain in tran|quillity.
There was one Dangerfield, a fellow who had
been burned in the hand for crimes, tran&s;ported, whip|ped,
pilloried four times, fined for cheats, outlawed for
felony, convicted of coining, and expo&s;ed to all the pub|lic
infamy, which the laws could inflict on the ba&s;e&s;t and
mo&s;t &s;hameful enormities. The credulity of the peo|ple,
and the humour of the times, enabled even this
man to become a per&s;on of con&s;equence.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Meal-tub plot.</NOTE> He was the
author of a new incident, called the <HI>Meal-tub plot,</HI> from
the place where &s;ome papers, regarding it, were found.
The bottom of this affair it is difficult, and not very ma|terial,
to di&s;cover. It only appears, that Dangerfield,
under pretence of betraying the con&s;piracies of the Pre&s;|byterians,
had been countenanced by &s;ome Catholics of
condition, and had even been admitted to the Duke's
pre&s;ence and the King's. And that under pretence of
revealing new popi&s;h plots, he had obtained acce&s;s to
Shafte&s;bury and &s;ome of the popular leaders. Which
&s;ide he intended to cheat, is uncertain; or whether he
did not rather mean to cheat both: But he &s;oon found,
that the belief of the nation was much more open to a
popi&s;h than a pre&s;byterian plot; and he re&s;olved to &s;trike
in with the prevailing humour. Tho' no weight could
<PB N="122" REF="156">
be laid on his te&s;timony, great clamour was rai&s;ed; as
if the Court, by way of retaliation, had intended to load
the Pre&s;byterians with the guilt of a fal&s;e con&s;piracy.
It mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that the pre&s;ent period, by the
prevalence and &s;u&s;picion of &s;uch mean and ignoble arts
on all &s;ides, throws a great &s;tain on the Briti&s;h annals.</P>
<P>ONE of the mo&s;t innocent artifices,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of No|vember.</NOTE> practi&s;ed by party|men
at this time, was the additional ceremony, pomp,
and expence, with which a pope-burning was celebrated
in London: This &s;pectacle &s;erved to entertain, and
amu&s;e, and enflame the populace. The duke of Mon|mouth
likewi&s;e came over without leave, and made a
triumphant proce&s;&s;ion thro' many parts of the kingdom,
extremely care&s;&s;ed and admired by the people. All the&s;e
arts &s;eemed requi&s;ite to &s;upport the general prejudices,
during the long interval of Parliament. Great endea|vours
were al&s;o u&s;ed to obtain the King's con&s;ent for
the meeting of that a&s;&s;embly.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1680.</NOTE> Seventeen peers pre&s;ented
a petition to that purpo&s;e. Many of the corporations
imitated this example. Notwith&s;tanding &s;everal marks
of di&s;plea&s;ure, and even a menacing proclamation from
the King, petitions came from all parts, earne&s;tly in&s;i&s;ting
on a &s;e&s;&s;ion of Parliament. The danger of popery, the terrors
of the plot, were never forgot in any of the&s;e addre&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>TUMULTUOUS petitioning was one of the chief arti|fices,
by which the malecontents in the la&s;t reign had
attacked the Crown: And tho' the manner of &s;ub&s;cri|bing
and delivering petitions was now &s;omewhat li|mited
by act of Parliament, the thing it&s;elf &s;till remain|ed;
and was an admirable expedient for infe&s;ting the
Court, for &s;preading di&s;content, and for uniting the
nation in any popular clamour. As the King found no
law, by which he could puni&s;h tho&s;e importunate, and,
as he e&s;teemed them, undutiful &s;ollicitations, he was
obliged to encounter them by popular applications of a
contrary tendency. Wherever the church and court
<PB N="123" REF="157">
party prevailed, addre&s;&s;es were framed, containing ex|pre&s;&s;ions
of the highe&s;t regard to his Maje&s;ty, the mo&s;t
entire acquie&s;cence in his wi&s;dom, the mo&s;t dutiful &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
to his prerogative, and the deepe&s;t <HI>abhorrence</HI> of
tho&s;e, who endeavoured to encroach on it, by pre&s;cri|bing
to him any time for a&s;&s;embling the Parliament.
Thus the nation came to be di&s;tingui&s;hed into <HI>Petitioners</HI>
and <HI>Abhorrers.</HI> Factions indeed were at this time ex|tremely
animated again&s;t each other. The very names,
by which each party denominated its antagoni&s;t, di&s;|cover
the virulence and rancour, which prevailed. For
be&s;ides Petitioner and Abhorrer, appellations which were
&s;oon forgot, this year is remarkable for being the epoch
of the well-known epithets of WHIG and TORY,
by which,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Whig and Tory.</NOTE> and &s;ometimes without any very material dif|ference,
this i&s;land has &s;o been &s;o long divided. The
court party reproached their antagoni&s;ts with their af|finity
to the fanatical conventiclers in Scotland, who
were known by the name of Whigs: The country party
found a re&s;emblance between the courtiers and the po|pi&s;h
banditti in Ireland, to whom the appellation of
Tory was affixed. And after this manner, the&s;e fooli&s;h
terms of reproach came into public and general u&s;e;
and even at pre&s;ent &s;eem not nearer their end than when
they were fir&s;t invented.</P>
<P>THE King u&s;ed every art to encourage his partizans,
and to reconcile the people to his government. He per|&s;evered
in the great zeal which he affected again&s;t popery.
He even allowed &s;everal prie&s;ts to be put to death, for
no other crime but their having received orders in the
Romi&s;h church. It is &s;ingular, that one of them, called
Evans, was playing at tennis, when the warrant for his
immediate execution was notified to him: He &s;wore,
that he would play out his &s;et fir&s;t. Charles, with
the &s;ame view of acquiring popularity, formed
an alliance with Spain, and al&s;o offered an alliance
<PB N="124" REF="158">
to Holland: But the Dutch, terrified with the great
power of France, and &s;eeing little re&s;&s;ource in a coun|try
&s;o di&s;tracted as England, declined acceptance. He
had &s;ent for the Duke from Scotland, but de&s;ired him
to return, when the time of &s;&s;embling the Parliament
began to approach.</P>
<P>IT was of great con&s;equence to the popular party,
while the meeting of the Parliament depended on the
King's will, to keep the law, who&s;e operations are per|petual,
entirely on their &s;ide. The &s;heriffs of London
by their office return the juries: It had been u&s;ual for
the mayor to nominate one &s;heriff by drinking to him;
and the common hall had ever without di&s;pute confirmed
the mayor's choice. Sir Robert Clayton, the mayor, na|med
one who was not acceptable to the popular party:
The common-hall rejected him; and Bethel and Corni&s;h,
two independants, and republicans, and of con&s;equence
deeply engaged with the malecontents, were cho&s;en by
a majority of voices. In &s;pite of all remon&s;trances and
oppo&s;ition, the citizens per&s;i&s;ted in their choice; and the
court party were obliged for the pre&s;ent to acquie&s;ce.</P>
<P>JURIES however were not &s;o partial in the city; but
that rea&s;on and ju&s;tice, even when the popi&s;h plot was
in que&s;tion, could &s;ometimes prevail. The earl of Ca&s;tle|maine,
hu&s;band to the famous dutche&s;s of Cleveland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of June.</NOTE>
was acquitted about this time; tho' accu&s;ed by Oates
and Dangerfield of an intention to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate the King.
Sir Thomas Ga&s;coigne, a very aged gentleman in the
north, being accu&s;ed by two &s;ervants, whom he had
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed for di&s;hone&s;ty, received a like verdict. The&s;e
trials were great blows to the plot, which now began to &s;tagger in the judgment of mo&s;t men, except tho&s;e
who were devoted to the country party. But in order
&s;till to pre&s;erve alive the zeal again&s;t popery, the earl of
Shafte&s;bury appeared in We&s;tmin&s;ter hall, attended by
the earl of Huntington, the lords Ru&s;&s;el, Cavendi&s;h,
<PB N="125" REF="159">
Gray, Brandon, Sir Henry Caverly, Sir Gilbert Ger|rard,
Sir William Cooper, and other per&s;ons of di&s;tinc|tion,
and pre&s;ented to the grand jury of Middle&s;ex rea|&s;ons
for indicting the Duke of York as a popi&s;h recu&s;ant.
While the jury were deliberating on this extraordinary
pre&s;entment, the chief ju&s;tice &s;ent for them up, and &s;ud|denly,
even &s;omewhat irregularly, di&s;mi&s;led them.
Shafte&s;bury however obtained the end, for which he had
undertaken this bold mea&s;ure: He &s;howed to all his
followers the de&s;perate re&s;olution, which he had em|braced,
never to admit of any accommodation or com|po&s;ition
with the Duke. By &s;uch daring conduct he a&s;|&s;ured
them, that he was fully determined not to de&s;ert
their cau&s;e, and he engaged them to a like devoted per|&s;everance
in all the mea&s;ures, which he &s;hould &s;ugge&s;t
to them.</P>
<P>As the kingdom was regularly and openly divided
into two zealous parties,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t of Oc|tober.</NOTE> it was not difficult for the King
to know,<NOTE PLACE="marg">A new Par|liament.</NOTE> that the majority of the new Hou&s;e of Com|mons
was engaged in intere&s;ts oppo&s;ite to the Court:
But that he might leave no expedient untried, which
could compo&s;e the unhappy differences among his &s;ub|jects,
he re&s;olved, at la&s;t, after a very long interval, to
a&s;&s;emble the Parliament. In his &s;peech, he told them,
that the &s;everal prorogations, which he had made, had been
very advantageous to his neighbours, and very u&s;eful to
him&s;elf: That he had employed that time in perfecting
with the Crown of Spain an alliance, which had been
often de&s;ired by former Parliaments, and which, he
doubted not, would be extremely agreeable to them:
That, in order to give weight to this mea&s;ure, and render
it beneficial to Chri&s;tendom, it was nece&s;&s;ary to avoid
all dome&s;tic di&s;&s;en&s;ions, and to unite them&s;elves firmly
in the &s;ame views and purpo&s;es: That he was determin|ed,
that nothing on his part &s;hould be wanting to &s;uch
a &s;alutary end; and provided the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion be pre&s;erved
<PB N="126" REF="160">
in its due and legal cour&s;e, he would concur in any
new expedients for the &s;ecurity of the prote&s;tant religion:
That the farther examination of the popi&s;h plot and the
puni&s;hment of the criminals, were requi&s;ite for the &s;afety
both of King and kingdom: And after recommending to
them the nece&s;&s;ity of providing, by &s;ome &s;upplies, for
the &s;afety of Tangiers, he proceeded in the&s;e words:
&startq;But that which I value above all the trea&s;ure in the
world, and which I am &s;ure will give us greater
&s;trength and reputation both at home and abroad than
any trea&s;ure can do, is a perfect union among our|&s;elves.
Nothing but this can re&s;tore the kingdom to
that &s;trength and vigour which it &s;eems to have lo&s;t,
and rai&s;e us again to that con&s;ideration, which Eng|land
hath u&s;ually po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. All Europe have their
eyes upon this a&s;&s;embly, and think their own happi|ne&s;s
and mi&s;ery, as well as ours, will depend upon
it. If we &s;hould be &s;o unhappy as to fall into mi&s;|under&s;tandings among our&s;elves to that degree as
would render our friend&s;hip un&s;afe to tru&s;t to, it will
not be wondered at, if our neighbours &s;hould begin to
take new re&s;olutions, and perhaps &s;uch as may be fa|tal
to us. Let us therefore take care, that we do not
gratify our enemies, and di&s;courage our friends, by any
un&s;ea&s;onable di&s;putes. If any &s;uch do happen, the
world will &s;ee, that it was no fault of mine: For I
have done all that it was po&s;&s;ible for me to do, to keep
you in peace, while I live, and to leave you &s;o, when
I die. But from &s;o great prudence and &s;o good affec|tion
as yours, I can fear nothing of this kind; but
do rely upon you all, that you will do your be&s;t en|deavours

the Commons. Every &s;tep, which they took, betrayed
that zeal, with which they were animated. They voted,
<PB N="127" REF="161">
that it was the undoubted right of the &s;ubject to petition
the King for the calling and fitting of Parliament. Not
contented with this deci&s;ion, which &s;eems very ju&s;tifiable
in a mixt Monarchy, they fell with the utmo&s;t violence
on all tho&s;e <HI>abhorrers,</HI> who in their addre&s;&s;es to the Crown,
had expre&s;&s;ed their di&s;approbation of tho&s;e petitions.
They did not reflect that it was as lawful for one party
of men, as for another, to expre&s;s their &s;entiments of
public affairs; and that the be&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hed right, in par|ticular
circum&s;tances, may be abu&s;ed, and even the ex|erci&s;e
of it become an object of abhorrence. For this
offence, they expelled Sir Thomas Withens. They ap|pointed
a committee for farther enquiry into &s;uch mem|bers
as had been guilty of a like crime; and complaints
were lodged again&s;t Lord Pa&s;ton, Sir Robert Malverer,
Sir Bryan Stapelton, Taylor and Turner. They ad|dre&s;&s;ed
the King again&s;t Sir George Jefferies, recorder
of London, for his activity in the &s;ame cau&s;e; and they
frightened him into a re&s;ignation of his office, in which
he was &s;ucceeded by Sir George Treby, a great leader
of the popular party. They voted an impeachment
again&s;t North, chief ju&s;tice of the common pleas, for
drawing the proclamation again&s;t tumultuous petitions:
But upon examination found the proclamation &s;o cauti|ou&s;ly
worded, that it afforded them no handle again&s;t
him. A petition had been pre&s;ented to the King from
Taunton. &startq;How dare you deliver me &s;uch a paper?&endq;
&s;aid the King to the per&s;on who pre&s;ented it. &startq;Sir,&endq;
replied he, &startq;my name is DARE.&endq; For this &s;aucy reply,
but under other pretences, he had been tried, fined, and
committed to pri&s;on. The Commons now addre&s;&s;ed the
King for his liberty and for the remittance of his fine.
Some printers al&s;o and authors of &s;editious libels, they
took under their protection.</P>
<P>GREAT numbers of the Abhorrers, from all parts of
England, were &s;eized by order of the Commons, and

committed to cu&s;tody. The liberty of the &s;ubject,
which had been &s;o carefully guarded by the great char|ter,
and by the late law of Habeas Corpus, was every
day violated by their arbitrary and capricious commit|ments.
The chief jealou&s;y, 'tis true, of the Engli&s;h con|&s;titution
is naturally and ju&s;tly directed again&s;t the
Crown; nor indeed have the Commons any other way
of &s;ecuring their privileges but by commitments, which,
as they cannot beforehand be exactly determined by law,
mu&s;t always appear in &s;ome degree arbitrary. Sen&s;ible of
the&s;e rea&s;ons, the people had hitherto, without mur|muring,
&s;een this di&s;cretionary power exerci&s;ed by the
Hou&s;e: But as it was now carried to extremes, and was
abu&s;ed to &s;erve the purpo&s;es of a faction, great com|plaints
again&s;t it were heard from all quarters. At la&s;t,
the vigour and courage of one Stowel of Exeter, an
Abhorrer, put an end to the practice. He refu&s;ed to
obey the &s;erjeant at arms, &s;tood upon his defence, and
&s;aid that he knew of no law, by which they pretended
to commit him. The hou&s;e, finding it equally dange|rous
to proceed or to recede, got off by an eva&s;ion:
They in&s;erted in their votes, that Stowel was indi&s;po|&s;ed,
and that a month's time was allowed him for his
recovery.</P>
<P>BUT the chief violence of the Hou&s;e of Commons
appeared in all their tran&s;actions with regard to the plot,
which they pro&s;ecuted with the &s;ame zeal and the &s;ame
credulity as their predece&s;&s;ors. They renewed the for|mer
vote, which affirmed the reality of the horrid po|pi&s;h
plot; and, in order to the more to terrify the peo|ple,
they even a&s;&s;erted, that, notwith&s;tanding the di&s;co|very,
the plot &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ted. They expelled Sir Robert
Can and Sir Robert Yeomans, who had been complain|ed
of, for &s;aying, that there was no popi&s;h, but there
was a pre&s;byterian plot. And they greatly lamented
the death of Bedloe, whom they called a material wit|ne&s;s,
<PB N="129" REF="165">
and on who&s;e te&s;timony they much depended.
He had been &s;eized with a fever at Bri&s;tol, had &s;ent
for chief ju&s;tice North, confirmed all his former evidence,
except that with regard to the Duke and the Queen,
and de&s;ired North to apply to the King for &s;ome money
to relieve him in his nece&s;&s;ities. A few days after he
died; and the whole party triumphed extremely in
this incident: As if &s;uch a te&s;timony could be e&s;teemed
the affirmation of a dying man, as if his confe&s;&s;ion of
perjury in &s;ome in&s;tances could a&s;&s;ure his veracity in the
re&s;t, and as if the per&s;everance of one profligate could
outweigh the la&s;t words of &s;o many men, guilty of no
other crime but that of popery.</P>
<P>THE Commons even endeavoured, by their counte|nance
and protection, to purge off the extreme infamy,
with which Dangerfield was loaded, and to re&s;tore him
to a capacity of being a witne&s;s. The whole tribe of
informers, they applauded and rewarded: Jenni&s;on, Tur|berville,
Dugdale, Smith, la Faria, appeared before
them; and their te&s;timony, however frivolous or ab&s;urd,
met with a favourable reception: The King was applied
to in their behalf for pen&s;ions and pardons: Their nar|ratives
were printed with that &s;anction, which aro&s;e
from the approbation of the Hou&s;e. Dr. Tongue was
recommended for the fir&s;t con&s;iderable church prefer|ment,
which &s;hould become vacant. Con&s;idering men's
determined re&s;olution to believe, in&s;tead of admiring that
a palpable fal&s;hood &s;hould be maintained by witne&s;&s;es,
it may ju&s;tly appear wonderful, that no better evidence
was ever produced again&s;t the Catholics.</P>
<P>THE principal rea&s;ons, which &s;till &s;upported the cla|mour
of the popi&s;h plot, were the apprehen&s;ions, &s;o ju&s;tly
entertained by the people, of the Duke of York, and
the re&s;olution,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exclu&s;ion&punc; bill.</NOTE> embraced by their leaders, of excluding
him from the throne. Shafte&s;bury and many con&s;idera|ble
men of the party, had rendered them&s;elves totally ir|reconcileable
with him, and could find their &s;afety no
<PB N="130" REF="166">
way but in his ruin. Monmouth's friends hoped, that
the exclu&s;ion of that Prince would make way for their
patron. The re&s;entment again&s;t the Duke's apo&s;tacy,
the love of liberty, the zeal for religion, the attach|ment
to faction; all the&s;e motives incited the country
party. And above all, what &s;upported the re&s;olution
of adhering to the exclu&s;ion, and rejecting all expedients
offered, was the hope artificially encouraged, that the
King would at la&s;t be obliged to yield to their demand.
His revenues were extremely burdened; and even if free,
could &s;carce &s;uffice for the nece&s;&s;ary charges of govern|ment,
much le&s;s for that plea&s;ure and expence, to which
he was &s;trongly inclined. Tho' he had withdrawn his
countenance from Monmouth, he was known &s;ecretly
to retain a great affection for him. On no occa&s;ion
had he ever been found to per&s;i&s;t ob&s;tinately again&s;t dif|ficulties
and importunity. And as his beloved ml&s;tre&s;s,
the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth, had been engaged, either
from lucrative views, or the hopes of making the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion fall on her own children, to unite her&s;elf
with the popular party; this incident was regarded
as a favourable progno&s;tic of their &s;ucce&s;s. Sun|derland,
&s;ecretary of &s;tate, who had linked his inte|re&s;t
with that of the dutche&s;s, had concurred in the
&s;ame mea&s;ure.</P>
<P>BUT be&s;ides friend&s;hip to his brother and a regard to
the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, there were many &s;trong rea&s;ons
which had determined Charles to per&s;evere in oppo&s;ing
the exclu&s;ion. All the royali&s;ts and the devotees to the
church; that party by which alone Monarchy was &s;up|ported;
regarded the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion as inviolable;
and if abandoned by the King in &s;o capital an article, it
was to be feared, that they would, in their turn, de|&s;ert
his cau&s;e, and deliver him over to the preten&s;ions
and u&s;urpations of the country party. The country party,
or the Whigs, as they were called, if they did not &s;till
retain &s;ome propen&s;ity towards a republic, were at lea&s;t
<PB N="131" REF="167">
affected with a violent jealou&s;y of regal power; and it was
equally to be dreaded, that being enraged with oppo&s;ition,
and animated with &s;ucce&s;s, they would, if they pre|vailed
in this preten&s;ion, be willing as well as able, to
reduce the prerogative within very narrow limits. All
menaces therefore, all promi&s;es were in vain employed
again&s;t the King's re&s;olution: He never would be pre|vailed
with to de&s;ert his friends, and put him&s;elf into
the hands of his enemies. And having voluntarily made
&s;uch important conce&s;&s;ions, and offered, over and over
again, &s;uch &s;trong limitations, he was well plea&s;ed to
find them rejected by the ob&s;tinacy of the Commons;
and hoped, that, after the &s;pirit of oppo&s;ition had &s;pent
it&s;elf in fruitle&s;s violence, the time would come, when
he might &s;afely appeal again&s;t his Parliament to his people.</P>
<P>SO much were the popular leaders determined to carry
matters to extremity, that in le&s;s than a week after the
commencement of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, a motion was made for
bringing in an exclu&s;ion-bill, and a committee was ap|pointed
for that purpo&s;e. This bill differed in nothing
from the former, but in two articles, which &s;howed &s;till
an increa&s;e of zeal in the Commons: The bill was to
be read to the people twice a year in all the churches of
the kingdom, and every one, who &s;hould &s;upport the
Duke's title, was rendered incapable of pardon but by
act of Parliament.</P>
<P>THE debates were carried on with great violence on
both &s;ides. The bill was defended by Sir William Jones,
who had now re&s;igned his office of attorney-general, by
lord Ru&s;&s;el, by Sir Francis Winnington, Sir Harry Capel,
Sir William Pulteney, by colonel Titus, Treby, Hamb|den,
Montague.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of No|vember.</NOTE> It was oppo&s;ed by Sir Leoline Jen|kins,
&s;ecretary of &s;tate, Sir John Ernley, chancellor of
the exchequer, by Hyde, Seymour, Temple. The ar|guments,
tran&s;mitted to us, may be reduced to the fol|lowing
topics.</P>

IN every government, &s;aid the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts, there is
&s;omewhere an authority ab&s;olute and &s;upreme; nor can
any determination, however unu&s;ual, which receives
the &s;anction of the legi&s;lature,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Arguments for and again&s;t the exclusion.</NOTE> ever&punc; afterwards admit of
di&s;pute or controul&punc; The liberty of any con&s;titution,
&s;o far from dimini&s;hing this ab&s;olute power, &s;eems rather
to add force to it, and to give it greater influence over
the people. The more parts of the &s;tate concur in any
legi&s;lative deci&s;ion, and the more free their voice; the
le&s;s likelihood is there that any oppo&s;ition will be made
to tho&s;e mea&s;ures, which receive the final &s;anction of
their authority. In England, the legi&s;lative power is
lodged in King, Lords, and Commons, which com|prehend
every order of the community: And there is no
pretext for exempting any circum&s;tance of government,
not even the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown, from &s;o full and
deci&s;ive a juri&s;diction. Even expre&s;s declarations have,
in this particular, been made of parliamentary authority:
In&s;tances have occurred, where it has been exerted:
And tho' prudential rea&s;ons may ju&s;tly be alleged, why
&s;uch innovations &s;hould never be attempted but on ex|traordinary
occa&s;ions, the power and right are for ever
ve&s;ted in the community. But if any occa&s;ion can be
deemed extraordinary, if any emergence can require un|u&s;ual
expedients, it is the pre&s;ent; when the heir to the
Crown has renounced the religion of the &s;tate, and has
zealou&s;ly embraced a faith, totally ho&s;tile and incompa|tible.
A prince of that communion can never put tru&s;t
in a people, &s;o prejudiced again&s;t him: The people mu&s;t
be equally diffident of &s;uch a prince. Foreign and de|&s;tructive alliances will &s;eem to the one the only protec|tion
of his throne: Perpetual jealou&s;y, oppo&s;ition, &s;action,
even in&s;urrections will be employed by the other as
the &s;ole &s;ecurities for their liberty and religion. Tho'
theological principles, when &s;et in oppo&s;ition to pa&s;&s;ions,
have often &s;mall influence on mankind in general, &s;till
<PB N="133" REF="171">
le&s;s on princes; yet when they become &s;ymbols of fac|tion,
and marks of party di&s;tinctions, they concur with
one of the &s;tronge&s;t pa&s;&s;ions in the human frame, and
are then capable of carrying men to the greate&s;t extre|mities.
Notwith&s;tanding the better judgment and mil|der
di&s;po&s;ition of the King; how much has the influ|ence
of the Duke already di&s;turbed the tenor of govern|ment?
How often engaged the nation into mea&s;ures to|tally
de&s;tructive of their foreign intere&s;ts and honour, of
their dome&s;tic repo&s;e and tranquillity? The more the
ab&s;urdity and incredibility of the popi&s;h plot are in&s;i&s;ted
on, the &s;tronger rea&s;on it affords for the exclu&s;ion of the
Duke; &s;ince the univer&s;al belief of it di&s;covers the ex|treme
antipathy of the nation to his religion, and the ut|ter
impo&s;&s;ibility of ever bringing them to acquie&s;ce peace|ably
under the dominion of &s;uch a Sovereign. The
prince, finding him&s;elf in &s;o perilous a &s;ituation, mu&s;t
&s;eek for &s;ecurity by de&s;perate remedies, and by totally
&s;ubduing the privileges of a nation, who had betrayed
&s;uch ho&s;tile di&s;po&s;itions towards him&s;elf, and towards
every thing which he deems the mo&s;t &s;acred. It is in
vain to propo&s;e limitations and expedients. Whatever
&s;hare of authority is left in the Duke's hands, will be
employed to the de&s;truction of the nation; and even the
additional re&s;traints, by di&s;covering the public diffidence
and aver&s;ion, will &s;erve him as incitements to put him|&s;elf
in a condition entirely ab&s;olute and independant.
And as the laws of England &s;till make re&s;i&s;tance trea&s;on,
and neither do nor can admit of any po&s;itive exceptions;
what folly to leave the kingdom in &s;o perilous and
ab&s;urd a &s;ituation; where the greate&s;t virtue will be ex|po&s;ed
to the mo&s;t &s;evere pro&s;cription, and where the
laws can only be &s;aved by expedients, which the&s;e
&s;ame laws have declared the highe&s;t crime and enormity?</P>
<P>THE court party rea&s;oned in an oppo&s;ite manner. An
authority, they thought, entirely ab&s;olute and uncon|troulable
<PB N="134" REF="172">
is a mere chimera, and is no where to be found
in any human in&s;titutions. All government is founded
on opinion and a &s;en&s;e of duty; and wherever the &s;u|preme
magi&s;trate, by any law or po&s;itive pre&s;cription,
&s;hocks an opinion regarded as fundamental, and e&s;ta|bli&s;hed
with equal firmne&s;s as his own authority, he
&s;ubverts the principle, by which he him&s;elf is e&s;tabli&s;hed,
and can no longer hope for obedience. In European
monarchies, the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion is ju&s;tly e&s;teemed a
fundamental; and even tho' the whole legi&s;lature be
ve&s;ted in a &s;ingle per&s;on, it would never be permitted
him, by an edict, to di&s;inherit his lawful heir, and call
a &s;tranger or more di&s;tant relation to the Throne. Abu&s;es
an other parts of government are capable of redre&s;s,
from more di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate enquiry or better information of
the Sovereign, and till then ought patiently to be en|dured:
But violations of the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion draw
&s;uch terrible con&s;equences after them as are not to be
paralleled by any other grievance or inconvenience.
Vainly is it pleaded, that England is a mixt Monar|chy;
and that a law, framed by King, Lords, and
Commons, is enacted by the concurrence of every part
of the &s;tate: It is plain, that there remains a very pow|erful
party, who may indeed be out-voted, but who
never will deem a law, &s;ubver&s;ive of hereditary right,
to be any wi&s;e valid or obligatory. Limitations, &s;uch
as are propo&s;ed by the King, give no &s;hock to the con|&s;titution,
which, in many particulars, is already li|mited;
and they may be &s;o calculated as to &s;erve every
purpo&s;e, which is &s;ought for by an exclu&s;ion. If the
antient barriers again&s;t regal authority have been able,
during &s;o many ages, to remain impregnable; how much
more, tho&s;e additional ones, which, by depriving the
Monarch of power, tend &s;o far to their own &s;ecurity?
The very &s;ame jealou&s;y too of religion, which has en|gaged
the people to lay the&s;e re&s;traints upon the &s;uc|ce&s;&s;or,
<PB N="135" REF="173">
will le&s;&s;en extremely the number of his partizans,
and make it utterly impracticable for him, either by force
or artifice, to break the fetters, impo&s;ed upon him.
The King's age and vigorous &s;tate of health promi&s;e him
a long life: And can it be prudent to tear the whole
&s;tate in pieces, in order to provide again&s;t a contingency,
which, it is very likely, may never happen? No hu|man
&s;chemes can &s;ecure the public in all po&s;&s;ible events;
and the bill of exclu&s;ion it&s;elf, however accurately
framed, leaves room for very obvious and very natural
&s;uppo&s;itions, to which it pretends not to provide any re|medy.
Should the Duke have a &s;on, after the King's
death; mu&s;t that &s;on, without any default of his own,
forfeit his title? Or mu&s;t the prince&s;s of Orange de&s;cend
from the Throne, in order to give place to the lawful
&s;ucce&s;&s;or? But were all the&s;e rea&s;onings fal&s;e, it &s;till re|mains
to be con&s;idered, that in public deliberations we
&s;eek not the expedient, which is be&s;t in it&s;elf, but the
be&s;t of &s;uch as are practicable. The King willingly con|&s;ents
to limitations, and has already offered &s;ome which
are of the utmo&s;t importance: But he is determined to en|dure
any extremity rather than allow the right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
to be invaded. Let us beware of that factious violence,
which leads us to demand more than will be granted;
le&s;t we lo&s;e the advantage of tho&s;e beneficial conce&s;&s;ions,
and leave the nation, on the King's decea&s;e, at the mercy
of a zealous prince, irritated with the ill u&s;age, which,
he imagines, he has already met with.</P>
<P>IN the Hou&s;e of Commons, the rea&s;oning of the ex|clu&s;ioni&s;ts
appeared the mo&s;t convincing; and the bill
pa&s;&s;ed by a great majority. It was in the Hou&s;e of Peers
that the King expected to oppo&s;e it with &s;ucce&s;s. The
court party was there &s;o prevalent, that it was carried
only by a majority of two to pay &s;o much re&s;pect to the
bill as even to commit it.<NOTE PLACE="marg">15th of No|vember.</NOTE> When it came to be de|bated,
the conte&s;t was very violent. Shafte&s;bury, Sun|derland,
<PB N="136" REF="174">
and E&s;&s;ex argued for it: Halifax chiefly con|ducted
the debate again&s;t it, and di&s;played an extent of
capacity and a force of eloquence, which had never been
&s;urpa&s;&s;ed in that a&s;&s;embly. He was animated, as well by
the greatne&s;s of the occa&s;ion, as by a rival&s;hip to his un|cle
Shafte&s;bury; whom, during that day's debate, he
&s;eemed, in the judgement of all, to have totally eclip&s;ed.
The King was pre&s;ent during the whole debate, which
was prolonged till eleven at night.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Exclu&s;ion-bill riejected.</NOTE> The bill was thrown
out by a con&s;iderable majority. All the bi&s;hops, except
three, voted again&s;t it. Be&s;ides the influence of the
Court over them; the church of England, they ima|gined
or pretended, was in much greater danger from
the prevalence of Pre&s;byteriani&s;m than of Popery, which,
tho' favoured by the Duke, and even by the King, was
extremely repugnant to the genuis of the nation.</P>
<P>THE Commons di&s;covered much ill humour upon this
di&s;appointment. They immediately voted an addre&s;s for
the removal of Halifax from the King's councils and pre|&s;ence
for ever. Tho' the pretended cau&s;e was his ad|vi&s;ing
the late frequent prorogations of Parliament, the
real rea&s;on was apparently his vigorous oppo&s;ition to the
exclu&s;ion-bill. When the King applied for money to
enable him to defend Tangiers, which he declared his
pre&s;ent revenues totally unable to &s;upport; in&s;tead
of complying, they voted &s;uch an addre&s;s as was in reality
a remon&s;trance, and one little le&s;s than violent that famous
remon&s;trance, which u&s;hered in the civil wars. All
the abu&s;es of government, from the beginning almo&s;t of the
reign, are there in&s;i&s;ted on; the Dutch war, the alliance
with France, the prorogations and di&s;&s;olutions of Par|liament;
and as all the&s;e mea&s;ures, as well as the <HI>damna|ble</HI>
and <HI>helli&s;h</HI> plot, are a&s;cribed to the machinations of
the Papi&s;ts, it was plainly in&s;inuated, that the King had,
all along, lain under the influence of that party, and was
in reality the chief con&s;pirator again&s;t the religion and
liberties of his people.</P>
<P><PB N="137" REF="175">
THE commons, tho' they conducted the great bu&s;ine&s;s
of the exclu&s;ion with extreme violence and even impru|dence,
had yet much rea&s;on for that jealou&s;y, which
gave ri&s;e to it: But their vehement pro&s;ecution of the

&s;uch a &s;pirit, either of credulity or inju&s;tice, as admits

<P>THERE were three witne&s;&s;es produced again&s;t the pri|&s;oner;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Stafford.</NOTE>
Oates, Dugdale, and Turberville. Oates &s;wore,
that he &s;aw Fenwic, the je&s;uit, deliver to Stafford a
commi&s;&s;ion &s;igned by de Oliva, general of the je&s;uits,
con&s;tituting him payma&s;ter to the papal army, which
was to be levied for the &s;ubduing of England: For this
ridiculous impo&s;ture &s;till maintened its credit with the
Commons. Dugdale gave te&s;timony, that the pri&s;oner,
at Tixal, a &s;eat of lord A&s;ton's, had endeavoured to en|gage
him in the de&s;ign of murdering the King; and had
promi&s;ed him, be&s;ides the honour of being &s;ainted by the
church, a reward of 500 pounds for that &s;ervice. Tur|berville
affirmed, that the pri&s;oner, in his own hou&s;e at
Paris, had made him alike propo&s;al. To offer money for
murdering a King, without laying down any &s;cheme, by
which the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;in may en&s;ure &s;ome probability or po&s;&s;ibility
of e&s;cape, is &s;o incredible in it&s;elf, and may &s;o ea&s;ily be
maintained by any pro&s;titute evidence, that an accu&s;ation
of that nature, not accompanied with circum&s;tances,
ought very little to be attended to by any court of judi|cature.
But notwith&s;tanding the &s;mall hold, which the
witne&s;&s;es afforded, the pri&s;oner was able, in many very
<PB N="138" REF="176">
material particulars, to di&s;credit their te&s;timony. It
was &s;worn by Dugdale, that Stafford had a&s;&s;i&s;ted in a
great con&s;ult of the Catholics held at Tixal; but Staf|ford
proved by undoubted te&s;timony, that at the time a&s;|&s;igned
he was in Bath, and in that neighbourhood,
Turberville had &s;erved a noviciate among the Domini|cans;
but having de&s;erted the convent, he had inli&s;ted
as a trooper in the French army; and being di&s;mi&s;&s;ed
that &s;ervice, he now lived in London, abandoned by all
his relations, and expo&s;ed to great poverty. Stafford
proved, by the evidence of his gentleman and his page,
that Turberville had never, either at Paris or at London,
been &s;een in his company; and it might ju&s;tly appear
&s;trange, that a per&s;on, who had &s;o important a &s;ecret in
his keeping, was &s;o long entirely neglected by him.</P>
<P>THE clamour and outrage of the populace, during the
trial, were extreme: Great ability and eloquence were
di&s;played by the managers, Sir William Jones, Sir Fran|cis
Winnington, &s;erjeant Maynard: Yet did the pri&s;o|ner,
under all the&s;e di&s;advantageous circum&s;tances, make
a better defence than was expected, either by his friends
or his enemies: The unequal conte&s;t, in which he was
engaged, was a plentiful &s;ource of compa&s;&s;ion to every
mind, &s;ea&s;oned with humanity. He repre&s;ented, that,
during a cour&s;e of forty years, from the very commence|ment
of the civil wars, he had, through many dangers,
difficulties, and lo&s;&s;es, &s;till maintained his loyalty: And
was it credible, that now in his old age, ea&s;y in his cir|cum&s;tances,
but di&s;pirited by infirmities, he would be|lye
the whole cour&s;e of his life, and engage, again&s;t his
royal ma&s;ter, from whom he had ever received kind treat|ment,
in the mo&s;t de&s;perate and mo&s;t bloody of all con|&s;piracies?
He remarked the infamy of the witne&s;&s;es; the
contradictions and ab&s;urdities of their te&s;timony; the ex|treme
indigence in which they had lived, tho' engaged,
as they pretended, in a con&s;piracy with Kings, Princes,
<PB N="139" REF="177">
and nobles; the credit and opulence to which they were
at pre&s;ent rai&s;ed. With a &s;implicity and tenderne&s;s more
per&s;ua&s;ive than the greate&s;t oratory, he &s;till made prote&s;|tations
of his innocence, and could not forbear, every
moment, expre&s;&s;ing the mo&s;t lively &s;urprize and indig|nation
at the audacious impudence of the witne&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>IT will ju&s;tly appear a&s;toni&s;hing to us, as it did to Staf|ford
him&s;elf, that the Peers, after a &s;olemn trial of &s;ix
days, &s;hould, by a majority of twenty-four voices, pro|nounce
&s;entence again&s;t him. He received however with
re&s;ignation the fatal verdict. <HI>God's holy name be prai&s;ed,</HI>
was the only exclamation which he uttered. When the
high-&s;teward told him, that the Peers would intercede
with the King for remitting the more cruel and ignomi|nious
parts of the &s;entence, hanging and quartering; he
bur&s;t into tears: But he told the Lords, that he was
moved to this weakne&s;s, by his &s;en&s;e of their goodne&s;s,
not by any terror of that fate, which he was doomed to
&s;uffer.</P>
<P>IT is remarkable, that after Charles, as is u&s;ual in
&s;uch ca&s;es, had remitted to Stafford the hanging and quar|tering,
the two &s;heriffs, Bethel and Corni&s;h, indulging
their own republican humour, and complying with the
prevalent &s;pirit of their party, ever jealous of Monarchy,
&s;tarted a doubt with regard to the King's power of exer|ci&s;ing
even this &s;mall degree of lenity. &startq;Since he cannot
pardon the whole,&endq; &s;aid they, &startq;how can he have
power to remit part of the &s;entence?&endq; They propo&s;ed
the doubt to both hou&s;es: The peers pronounced it &s;u|perfluous;
and even the Commons, apprehen&s;ive le&s;t a
que&s;tion of this nature might make way for Stafford's e&s;|cape,
gave this &s;ingular an&s;wer. &startq;This Hou&s;e is <HI>content,</HI>
that the &s;heriffs do execute William late vi&s;count Staf|ford
by &s;evering his head from his body <HI>only.</HI>&endq; No|thing
can be a &s;tronger proof of the fury of the times,
than that lord Ru&s;&s;el, notwith&s;tanding the virtue and hu|manity
<PB N="140" REF="178">
of his character, &s;econded in the Hou&s;e this bar|barous
&s;cruple of the &s;heriffs.</P>
<P>IN the interval between the &s;entence and execution,
many efforts were made to &s;hake the re&s;olution of the in|firm
and aged pri&s;oner, and to bring him to &s;ome con|fe&s;&s;ion
of that trea&s;on for which he was now condemned.
It was even rumoured, that he had confe&s;&s;ed; and the
zealous partymen, who, no doubt, had &s;ecretly, not|with&s;tanding
their credulity, entertained &s;ome &s;cruple
with regard to the popi&s;h con&s;piracy, expre&s;&s;ed great
triumph on this occa&s;ion. But Stafford, when again
called before the Hou&s;e of Peers, di&s;covered many
&s;chemes, which had been laid by him&s;elf and others for
procuring a toleration to the Catholics, at lea&s;t a miti|gation
of the penal laws, enacted again&s;t them: And he
prote&s;ted, that this was the &s;ole trea&s;on of which he had
ever been guilty.</P>
<P>STAFFORD now prepared him&s;elf for death with that
intrepidity which became his birth and &s;tation, and which
was the natural re&s;ult of the innocence and integrity,
which, during the cour&s;e of a long life, he had ever
maintained: His mind &s;eemed even to collect new force
from the violence and oppre&s;&s;ion, under which he labour|ed.
When going to execution, he called for a cloak to
defend him again&s;t the rigour of the &s;ea&s;on.<NOTE PLACE="marg">29th of De|cember.</NOTE> &startq;Perhaps,
&s;aid he, I may &s;hake with cold; but, I tru&s;t in God,
not for fear.&endq;<NOTE PLACE="marg">and execu|tion.</NOTE> On the &s;caffold, he continued, with
reiterated and earne&s;t a&s;&s;everations, to make prote&s;tions
of his innocence: All his fervour was exerci&s;ed on that
point: When he mentioned the witne&s;&s;es, who&s;e per|juries
had bereaved him of life, his expre&s;&s;ions were full
of mildne&s;s and of charity. He &s;olemnly di&s;avowed all
tho&s;e immoral principles, which over-zealous Prote&s;|tants
had a&s;cribed without di&s;tinction to the church of
Rome: And he hoped, he &s;aid, that the time was now
approaching, when the pre&s;ent delu&s;ion would be di&s;|&s;ipated;
<PB N="141" REF="179">
and when the force of truth, tho' late, would
engage the whole world to make reparation to his in|jured
honour.</P>
<P>THE populace, who had exulted at Stafford's trial and
condemnation, were now melted into tears, at the &s;ight
of that tender fortitude, which &s;hone forth in each fea|ture,
and motion, and accent of this aged noble. Their
profound &s;ilence was only interrupted by &s;ighs and groans:
With difficulty they found &s;peech to a&s;&s;ent to tho&s;e pro|te&s;tations
of innocence, which he frequently repeated:
&startq;We believe you, my lord! God ble&s;s you, my lord!&endq;
The&s;e expre&s;&s;ions with a faultering accent flowed from
them. The executioner him&s;elf was touched with &s;ym|pathy.
Twice he lifted up the ax, with an intent to
&s;trike the fatal blow; and as often felt his re&s;olution to
fail him. A deep &s;igh was heard to accompany his la&s;t
effort, which laid Stafford for ever at re&s;t. All the &s;pec|tators
&s;eemed to feel the blow. And when the head was
held up to them with the u&s;ual cry, <HI>This is the head of a
traitor,</HI> no clamour of a&s;&s;ent was uttered. Pity, remor&s;e,
and a&s;toni&s;hment had taken po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of every heart, and
di&s;played it&s;elf in every countenance.</P>
<P>THIS is the la&s;t blood which was &s;hed on account of
the popi&s;h plot: An incident, which, for the credit of
the nation, it were better to bury in eternal oblivion;
but which it is nece&s;&s;ary to perpetuate, as well to main|tain
the truth of hi&s;tory, as to warn, if po&s;&s;ible, their
po&s;terity and all mankind never again to fall into &s;o
&s;hameful and &s;o barbarous a delu&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE execution of Stafford gratified the prejudices of
the country party; but it contributed nothing to their
power and &s;ecurity: On the contrary, by exciting com|mi&s;eration,
it tended &s;till farther to encrea&s;e that di&s;belief
of the whole plot, which began now to prevail. The
Commons, therefore, not to lo&s;e the pre&s;ent occa&s;ion,
re&s;olved to make both friends and enemies &s;en&s;ible of
<PB N="142" REF="180">
their authority. They pa&s;&s;ed a bill for ea&s;ing the Pro|te&s;tant
Di&s;&s;enters, and for repealing the per&s;ecuting &s;ta|tute
of the thirty-fifth of Elizabeth: This laudable bill
was likewi&s;e carried thro' the Hou&s;e of Peers. The
chief ju&s;tice was very obnoxious for di&s;mi&s;&s;ing the grand
jury in an irregular manner, and thereby preventing that
bold mea&s;ure of Shafte&s;bury and his friends, who had
pre&s;ented the Duke as a Recu&s;ant. For this crime the
Commons &s;ent up an impeachment again&s;t him; as al&s;o
again&s;t Jones and We&s;ton, two of the judges, who, in
&s;ome &s;peeches from the bench, had gone &s;o far as to give
to many of the fir&s;t Reformers the denomination of Fa|natics.</P>
<P>THE King, in rejecting the exclu&s;ion bill, had &s;hel|tered
him&s;elf &s;ecurely behind the authority of the Hou&s;e
of Peers; and the Commons had been deprived of the
u&s;ual pretence to attack the Sovereign him&s;elf, under co|lour
of attacking his mini&s;ters and coun&s;ellors. In pro|&s;ecution
however of the &s;cheme, which he had formed,
of throwing the blame on the Commons in ca&s;e of any
rupture, he made them a new &s;peech. After warning
them, that a neglect of this opportunity would never be
retrieved, he added the&s;e words: &startq;I did promi&s;e you the
fulle&s;t &s;atisfaction, which your hearts could wi&s;h, for
the &s;ecurity of the prote&s;tant religion, and to concur with
you in any remedies, which might con&s;i&s;t with pre&s;erv|ing
the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Crown in its due and legal
cour&s;e of de&s;cent. I do again, with the &s;ame re&s;er|vations,
renew the &s;ame promi&s;es to you: And being
thus ready on my part to do all that can rea&s;onably be
expected from me, I &s;hould be glad to know from you,
as &s;oon as may be, how far I &s;hall be a&s;&s;i&s;ted by you
and what it is you de&s;ire from me.&endq;</P>
<P>THE mo&s;t rea&s;onable objection again&s;t the limitations
propo&s;ed by the King, is, that they introduced too con|&s;iderable an innovation in the government, and almo$$|totally
<PB N="143" REF="181">
annihilated the power of the Monarch. But con|&s;idering
the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the Commons and their
leaders, we may fairly pre&s;ume, that this objection would
have &s;mall weight with them, and that their di&s;gu&s;t again&s;t
the Court would rather incline them to dimini&s;h than
&s;upport regal authority. They &s;till hoped, from the
King's urgent nece&s;&s;ities, and his u&s;ual facility, that he
would throw him&s;elf wholly into their hands; and that
thus, without waiting for the acce&s;&s;ion of the Duke,
they might immediately render them&s;elves ab&s;olute ma&s;ters
of the government.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Violence of the Com|mons.</NOTE> The Commons, therefore, be&s;ides
in&s;i&s;ting &s;till on the exclu&s;ion, proceeded to bring in bills
of a very important, and &s;ome of them of a very alarm|ing
nature: One to renew the triennial act, which had
been &s;o inadvertently repealed in the beginning of the
reign: A &s;econd to make the office of judge during good
behaviour: A third to declare the levying of money with|out
con&s;ent of Parliament to be high trea&s;on: A fourth
to order an a&s;&s;ociation for the &s;afety of his Maje&s;ty's
per&s;on, for defence of the prote&s;tant religion, for the
pre&s;ervation of the prote&s;tant &s;ubjects again&s;t all inva&s;ions
and oppo&s;ition what&s;oever, and for preventing the Duke
of York or any Papi&s;t from &s;ucceeding to the Crown.
The memory of the covenant was too recent for men
to overlook the con&s;equences of &s;uch an a&s;&s;ociation: And
the King, who was particularly conver&s;ant in Davila,
could not fail of recollecting a memorable foreign in|&s;tance to fortify this dome&s;tic experience.</P>
<P>THE Commons al&s;o pa&s;&s;ed many votes, which, tho'
they had not the authority of laws, &s;erved however to di&s;|cover
the temper and di&s;po&s;ition of the Hou&s;e. They
voted, that whoever had advi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to refu&s;e
the exclu&s;ion bill, were promoters of popery and ene|mies
to the King and kingdom. In another vote, they
named the marque&s;s of Worce&s;ter, the earls of Claren|don,
Fever&s;ham, and Halifax, Laurence Hyde, and Ed|ward
<PB N="144" REF="182">
Seymour, as tho&s;e dangerous enemies, and they
reque&s;ted his Maje&s;ty to remove them from his per&s;on
and councils for ever: They voted, that, till the exclu|&s;ion
bill was pa&s;&s;ed, they could not, con&s;i&s;tent with the
tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them, grant the King any manner of
&s;upply. And left he &s;hould be enabled, by any other ex|pedient,
to &s;upport the government, and pre&s;erve him|&s;elf
independant, they pa&s;&s;ed another vote, in which
they declared, that whoever &s;hould hereafter lend, by
way of advance, any money upon tho&s;e branches of the
King's revenue, ari&s;ing from cu&s;toms, exci&s;e, or hearth
money, &s;hould be judged a hinderer of the &s;itting of
Parliament, and be re&s;pon&s;ible for the &s;ame in Parliament.</P>
<P>THE King might pre&s;ume, that the Peers, who had
rejected the exclu&s;ion bill, would &s;till continue to de|fend
the Throne, and that none of the dangerous bills,
introduced into the other Hou&s;e, would ever be pre&s;ent|ed
for the royal a&s;&s;ent and approbation. But as there re|mained
no hopes of bringing the Commons to any com|po&s;ure,
and as their farther &s;itting &s;erved only to keep
faction alive, and to perpetuate the general ferment of
the nation, he came &s;ecretly to a re&s;olution of prorogue|ing
them.<NOTE PLACE="marg">1681.</NOTE> They got intelligence about a quarter of an
hour before the black rod came to their door.<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of Ja|nuary. Di&s;&s;olution of the Par|liament.</NOTE> Not to
lo&s;e &s;uch precious time, they pa&s;&s;ed in a very tumultuous
manner &s;ome very extraordinary re&s;olutions. They voted,
<HI>that</HI> who&s;oever advi&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to prorogue this Par|liament
to any other purpo&s;e than in order to pa&s;s the bill
of exclu&s;ion, was a betrayer of the King, of the prote&s;|tant
religion, and of the kingdom of England; a promot|er
of the French intere&s;t, and a pen&s;ioner of France:
<HI>That</HI> thanks be given to the city of London for their ma|nife&s;t
loyalty, and for their care and vigilance in the pre|&s;ervation
of the King and of the prote&s;tant religion: <HI>That</HI>
it is the opinion of this Hou&s;e, that that city was burn|ed
in the year 1666 by the Papi&s;ts, de&s;igning thereby to
<PB N="145" REF="183">
introduce arbitrary power and popery into the king|dom:
<HI>That</HI> humble application be made to his maje&s;ty to
re&s;tore the duke of Monmouth to all his offices and com|mands,
from which, it appears to the Hou&s;e, he had
been removed by the influence of the duke of York.
And <HI>that</HI> it is the opinion of the Hou&s;e, that the pro&s;e|cution
of the Prote&s;tant di&s;&s;enters upon the penal laws
is at this time grievous to the &s;ubject, a weakening of
the prote&s;tant intere&s;t, an encouragement of popery,
and dangerous to the peace of the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE King pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome laws of no great importance:
But the bill for repealing the thirty fifth of Elizabeth,
he privately ordered the clerk of the Crown not to pre|&s;ent
to him. By this artifice, which was equally di&s;o|bliging
to the country party as if the bill had been re|jected,
and at the &s;ame time implied &s;ome meanne&s;s
and timidity in the King, that &s;alutary act was for the
pre&s;ent eluded. The King had often of him&s;elf attempt|ed,
and &s;ometimes by irregular means, to give indul|gence
to Nonconformi&s;ts: But be&s;ides, that he had u&s;u|ally
expected to comprehend the Catholics in this liberty,
the pre&s;ent refractory di&s;po&s;ition of the Sectaries had much
incen&s;ed him again&s;t them, and he was &s;till re&s;olved, if
po&s;&s;ible, to keep them at mercy.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t votes of the Commons &s;eemed to be an
attempt of forming indirectly an a&s;&s;ociation again&s;t the
Crown, after they found, that their a&s;&s;ociation bill could
not pa&s;s: The di&s;&s;enting intere&s;t, the city, and the duke
of Monmouth, they endeavoured to connect with the coun|try
party. A civil war indeed never appeared &s;o likely as
at pre&s;ent; and it was high time for the King to di&s;&s;olve
a Parliament, which &s;eemed to have entertained &s;uch
dangerous projects. Soon after, he &s;ummoned another.
Tho' he ob&s;erved, that the country party had e&s;tabli&s;hed
their intere&s;t &s;o &s;trongly in all the electing burroughs,
that he could not hope for any di&s;po&s;ition more favou|rable
<PB N="146" REF="184">
in the new Parliament, this expedient was &s;till a
prosecution of his former project, of trying every method,
by which he might form an accommodation with the
Commons: And if all failed, he hoped, that he could
the better ju&s;tify to his people, at lea&s;t to his party, a
final breach with them.</P>
<P>IT had always been much regretted by the Royali&s;ts
during the civil wars, that the Long Parliament had been
a&s;&s;embled at We&s;tmin&s;ter, and had thereby received force
and encouragement from the neighbourhood of a potent
and factious city, which had zealou&s;ly embraced their
party. Tho' the King was now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of guards,
which, in &s;ome mea&s;ure overawed the populace, he was
determined &s;till farther to obviate all inconveniences;
and he &s;ummoned the new Parliament to meet at Oxford.
The city of London &s;howed how ju&s;t a judgment he
had formed of their di&s;po&s;ition. Be&s;ides re-electing $word$
&s;ame members, they voted thanks to them for their for|mer
behaviour, in endeavouring to di&s;cover the depth of
the <HI>horrid</HI> and <HI>helli&s;h</HI> popi&s;h plot, and to exclude the
Duke of York, the principal cau&s;e of the ruin and mi|&s;ery,
impending over the nation. Monmouth with fifteen
Peers pre&s;ented a petition again&s;t a&s;&s;embling the Parliament
at Oxford, &startq;where the two Hou&s;es,&endq; they &s;aid,
&startq;could not be in &s;afety; but would be ea&s;ily expo&s;ed
to the &s;words of the Papi&s;ts and their adherents, of
whom too many had crept into his Maje&s;ty's guards.&endq;
The&s;e in&s;inuations, which &s;truck &s;o evidently at the
King him&s;elf, were not calculated to per&s;wade him, but
to inflame the people.</P>
<P>THE Exclu&s;ioni&s;ts might have concluded, both from
the King's di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t Parliament, and from
his &s;ummoning of the pre&s;ent to meet at Oxford, that
he was determined to maintain his declared re&s;olution of
rejecting their favourite bill: But they &s;till flattered them|&s;elves,
that his urgent nece&s;&s;ities would influence his ea&s;y
<PB N="147" REF="185">
temper, and finally gain them the a&s;cendant. The lea|ders
came to Parliament, attended not only with their
&s;ervants, but with numerous bands of their followers
and partizans. The four city members in particular
were followed by great multitudes, wearing ribbons, in
which were woven the&s;e words, <HI>No Popery! No Slavery!</HI>
The King had his guards regularly mu&s;tered; His party
likewi&s;e endeavoured to make a &s;how of their &s;trength:
And on the whole, the a&s;&s;embly at Oxford bore more
the appearance of a tumultuous Poli&s;h diet, than of a
regular Engli&s;h Parliament.</P>
<P>THE King,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t of March.</NOTE> who had hitherto employed the mo&s;t gra|cious
expre&s;&s;ions to all his Parliaments, particularly the
two la&s;t, thought proper to addre&s;s him&s;elf to the pre|&s;ent
in a more authoritative manner.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New parlia|ment at Ox|ford.</NOTE> He complained of
the unwarrantable proceedings of the former Hou&s;e of
Commons; and &s;aid, that, as he would never u&s;e arbi|trary
government him&s;elf, neither would he ever &s;uffer
it in others. By calling however this Parliament &s;o &s;oon,
he had &s;ufficiently &s;hown, that no pa&s;t irregularities could
in&s;pire him with a prejudice again&s;t tho&s;e a&s;&s;emblies. He
now afforded them, he added, another opportunity of
providing for the public &s;afety; and to all the world had
given one evidence more, that on his part he had not ne|glected
the duty incumbent on him.</P>
<P>THE Commons were not over-awed with the magi|&s;terial
air of the King's &s;peech. They con&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t
entirely of the &s;ame members; they cho&s;e the &s;ame &s;pea|ker;
and they in&s;tantly fell into the &s;ame mea&s;ures, the
impeachment of Danby, the repeal of the per&s;ecuting
&s;tatute of Elizabeth, the enquiry into the popi&s;h plot,
and the bill of exclu&s;ion. So violent were they on this
la&s;t article, that no expedient, however plau&s;ible, could &s;o
much as be hearkened to. Ernely, one of the King's
mini&s;ters, propo&s;ed, that the Duke &s;hould be bani&s;hed,
during life, five hundred miles from England, and that

on the King's demi&s;e the next heir &s;hould be con&s;tituted
regent with regal power: Yet even this expedient, which
left the Duke only the bare title of King, could not,
tho' &s;econded by Sir Thomas Lyttleton and Sir Thomas
Mompe&s;&s;ion, obtain the attention of the Hou&s;e. The
pa&s;t di&s;appointments of the country party, and the oppo|&s;ition
made by the court, had only rendered them more
united, more haughty, and more determined. No
other method but their own, of excluding the Duke,
could give them any &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>THERE was one Fitz-harris,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Fitz-harris's ca&s;e.</NOTE> an Iri&s;h Catholic, who
had in&s;inuated him&s;elf into the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth's
acquaintance, and had been very bu&s;y in conveying to
her intelligence of any libel wrote by the country party, or
of any de&s;igns entertained again&s;t her or again&s;t the court.
For &s;ervices of this kind, and perhaps too, from a regard
to his father, Sir Edward Fitz-Harris, who had been an
eminent royali&s;t, he had received from the King a pre|&s;ent
of 250 pounds. This man met with one Everard,
a Scotchman, a &s;py of the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts, and an infor|mer
of the popi&s;h plot; and he propo&s;ed to him to write
a libel again&s;t the King, the Duke, and the whole ad|mini&s;tration.
What Fitz-harris's intentions were, can|not
well be a&s;certained; it is probable, as he afterwards
a&s;&s;erted, that he meant to carry this libel to his patron,
the dutche&s;s, and to make a merit of the di&s;covery. Eve|rard,
who &s;u&s;pected &s;ome other de&s;ign, and who was
plea&s;ed on his &s;ide to have the merit of a di&s;covery with
his patrons, re&s;olved to betray his friend: He po&s;ted Sir
William Waller, a noted ju&s;tice of peace, and two per|&s;ons
more behind the hangings, and gave them an oppor|tunity
of &s;eeing and hearing the whole tran&s;action. The
libel, &s;ketched out by Fitz-harris, and executed partly
by him, partly by Everard, was the mo&s;t furious, indecent,
and outrageous performance imaginable; and &s;uch as was
fitter to hurt than &s;erve any party, which &s;hould be &s;o
<PB N="149" REF="189">
imprudent as to adopt it. Waller carried the intelligence
to the King, and obtained a warrant for committing Fitz|harris,
who happened, at that very time, to have a copy
of the libel in his pocket. Finding him&s;elf now delive|red
over to the law, he re&s;olved to pay court to the po|pular
party, who were alone able to protect him, and
by whom he ob&s;erved almo&s;t all trials to be governed
and directed. He &s;aid, that he had been employed by
the court to write the libel, in order to throw the odium
of it on the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts: But this account, which was
within the bounds of credibility, he di&s;graced by circum|&s;tances,
which are altogether ab&s;urd and improbable.
The intention of the mini&s;ters, he &s;aid, was to &s;end
about copies to all the heads of the country party; and
the moment they received them, they were to be arre&s;ted,
and a con&s;piracy to be imputed to them. That he might
merit favour by &s;till more important intelligence, he com|menced
a di&s;coverer of the great popi&s;h plot; and he fai|led
not to confirm all the tremendous circum&s;tances, in|&s;i&s;ted
on by his predece&s;&s;ors. He &s;aid, that the &s;econd
Dutch war was entered into with a view of extirpating
the prote&s;tant religion, both abroad and at home; that
father Parry, a je&s;uit, on the di&s;appointment by the peace,
told him, that the Catholics re&s;olved to de&s;troy the King,
and had even engaged the Queen in that de&s;ign; that
the envoy of Modena offered him 10,000 pounds to
kill the King, and upon his refu&s;al the envoy &s;aid, that
the dutche&s;s of Mazarine, who was as expert at poi&s;on|ing
as her &s;i&s;ter, the counte&s;s of Soi&s;&s;ons, would, with
a little phial, execute that de&s;ign; that upon the King's
death the army in Flanders were to come over, and ma&s;|&s;acre
the Prote&s;tants; that money was rai&s;ed in Italy for
recruits and &s;upplies, and there &s;hould be no more Par|liaments;
and that the Duke was privy to this whole
plan, and had even entered into the de&s;ign of Godfrey's
<PB N="150" REF="190">
murder, which was afterwards executed in the manner
related by Prance.</P>
<P>THE popular leaders had, all along, been very de|&s;irous
of having an accu&s;ation again&s;t the Duke; and
tho' Oates and Bedloe, in their fir&s;t intelligence, had
not dared to go &s;o far, both Dugdale and Dangerfield
had afterwards been encouraged to &s;upply &s;o material a
defect, by comprehending him in the con&s;piracy. The
Commons, therefore, finding that Fitz-harris was al&s;o
willing to &s;erve this purpo&s;e, were not a&s;hamed to adopt
his evidence, and re&s;olved for that end to &s;ave him from
the de&s;truction with which he was at pre&s;ent threatened.
The King had removed him from the city-pri&s;on, where
he was expo&s;ed to be tampered with by the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts;
had &s;ent him to the Tower; and had ordered him to
be pro&s;ecuted by an indictment at common law. In or|der
to prevent his trial, and execution, an impeachment
was voted by the Commons again&s;t him, and &s;ent up to
the Lords. That they might &s;how, the greater contempt
of the Court, they ordered, by way of deri&s;ion, that
the impeachment &s;hould be carried up by &s;ecretary Jen|kins;
who was &s;o provoked by the intended affront, that
he at fir&s;t refu&s;ed obedience; tho' afterwards, being
threatened with commitment, he was induced to com|ply
The Lords voted to remit the affair to the ordi|nary
courts of judicature, before whom, as the attor|ney-general
informed them, it was already determined to
try Fitz-harris. The Commons maintained, that the
Peers were obliged to receive every impeachment from
the Commons; and this indeed &s;eems to have been the
fir&s;t in&s;tance of their refu&s;al: They therefore voted, that
the Lords, in rejecting their impeachment, had denied
ju&s;tice, and had violated the con&s;titution of Parliament.
They al&s;o declared, that whatever inferior court &s;hould
proceed again&s;t Fitz-harris, or any one that lay under
<PB N="151" REF="191">
impeachment, would be guilty of a high breach of pri|vilege.
Great heats were likely to en&s;ue; and as the
King found no likelihood of any better temper in the
Commons, he gladly laid hold of the opportunity, af|forded
by a quarrel between the two Hou&s;es, and he pro|ceeded
to a di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Parliament di&s;&s;olved.</NOTE> The &s;ecret
was &s;o well kept, that the Commons had no intimation
of it, till the black rod came to their door, and &s;um|moned
them to attend the King at the Hou&s;e of Peers.</P>
<P>THIS vigorous mea&s;ure, tho' it might have been fore|&s;een,
excited &s;uch a&s;toni&s;hment in the country party, as
deprived them of all &s;pirit, and reduced them to ab&s;olute
de&s;pair. They were &s;en&s;ible, tho' too late, that the
King had finally taken his re&s;olution, and was deter|mined
to endure any extremity rather than &s;ubmit to
tho&s;e terms, which they had re&s;olved to impo&s;e upon
him. They found, that he had patiently waited till af|fairs
&s;hould come to full maturity; and having now
engaged a national party on his &s;ide, had boldly &s;et his
enemies at defiance. No Parliaments, they knew,
would be &s;ummoned for &s;ome years; and during that long
interval, the Court, tho' perhaps at the head of an infe|rior
party, yet being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all authority, would
have every advantage over a body, di&s;per&s;ed and di&s;u|nited.
The&s;e reflections crowded upon every one; and
all the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts were terrified, left Charles &s;hould &s;e|cond
the blow by &s;ome action more violent, and im|mediately
take vengeance on them for their long and ob|&s;tinate
oppo&s;ition to his mea&s;ures. The King on his part
was no le&s;s apprehen&s;ive, left de&s;pair might engage them
to have recour&s;e to force, and make &s;ome &s;udden attempt
upon his per&s;on. Both parties therefore hurried away from
Oxford; and in an in&s;tant, that city, &s;o crowded and
bu&s;y, was left in its u&s;ual emptine&s;s and tranquillity.</P>
<P>THE court party gathered force from the di&s;per&s;ion and
a&s;toni&s;hment of their antagoni&s;ts, and adhered more firmly

to the King, who&s;e re&s;olutions, they now &s;aw, could
be entirely depended on. The violence of the exclu&s;i|oni&s;ts
was every$where exclaimed again&s;t and aggravated;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Victory of the Roya|li&s;ts.</NOTE>
and even the reality of the plot, that great engine of their
authority, was openly called in que&s;tion. The clergy
e&s;pecially were bu&s;y in this great revolution; and be|ing
moved, partly by their own fears, partly by the in|&s;inuations
of the Court, they repre&s;ented all their anta|goni&s;ts
as Sectaries and Republicans, and rejoiced in
e&s;caping all tho&s;e perils, which they believed to have
been hanging over them. Principles, the mo&s;t oppo&s;ite
to civil liberty, were every where inforced from the pul|pit;
and adopted in numerous addre&s;&s;es; where the King
was flattered in his pre&s;ent mea&s;ures, and congratulated
on his e&s;cape from Parliaments. Could words have been
depended on, the nation appeared to be running fa&s;t into
voluntary &s;ervitude, and &s;eemed even ambitious of re|&s;igning
into the King's hands all the privileges, tran&s;|mitted
to them, thro' &s;o many ages, by their gallant
ance&s;tors.</P>
<P>BUT Charles had &s;agacity enough to di&s;tingui&s;h be|tween
men's real internal &s;entiments, and the language,
which zeal and oppo&s;ition to a contrary &s;action may &s;ome|times
extort from them. Notwith&s;tanding all the&s;e pro|fe&s;&s;ions
of duty and obedience, he was re&s;olved not to
tru&s;t, for a long time, the people with a new election,
but to depend entirely on his own oeconomy for allevi|ating
tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ities, under which he laboured. Great
retrenchments were made in the hou&s;hold: Even his fa|vourite
navy was neglected: Tangiers, tho' it had co&s;t
great &s;ums of money, was a few years after abandoned
and demoli&s;hed. The mole was entirely de&s;troyed; and
the garri&s;on, being brought over to England, &s;erved to
augment that &s;mall army, which the King relied on, as
one &s;olid ba&s;is of his authority. It had been happy for
the nation, had Charles u&s;ed. his victory with ju&s;tice
<PB N="153" REF="195">
and moderation equal to the prudence and dexterity,
with which he obtained it.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t &s;tep, taken by the court, was the trial of
Fitz-harris. Doubts were rai&s;ed by the jury with regard
to their power of trying him, after the concluding vote
of the Commons: But the judges took upon them to
decide the que&s;tion in the a&s;&s;irmative; and the jury were
obliged to proceed. The writing the libel was clearly
proved upon Fitz-harris: The only que&s;tion was with regard
to his intentions. He afferted, that he was a &s;py of the
Court, and had accordingly carried the libel to the dutch|e&s;s
of Port&s;mouth; and he was de&s;irous, that the jury
&s;hould, in this tran&s;action, con&s;ider him as a cheat,
not as a traitor. He failed however &s;omewhat in the
proof; and was brought in guilty of trea&s;on by the jury.</P>
<P>FINDING him&s;elf entirely in the hands of the King, he
now retracted all his former impo&s;tures with regard to the
popi&s;h plot, and even endeavoured to attone for them by
new impo&s;tures again&s;t the country party. He affirmed,
that the&s;e fictions had been extorted from him by the &s;ug|ge&s;tions
and artifices of Treby the recorder, and of Bethel
and Corni&s;h, the two &s;heriffs. This account he per&s;i&s;ted
in even at his execution; and tho' men knew, that no|thing
could be depended on, which came from one &s;o
corrupt, and &s;o lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of honour; yet were they
inclined, from his per&s;everance, to rely &s;omewhat more
on his veracity in the&s;e la&s;t a&s;&s;everations. But it appears
that his wi&s;e had &s;ome connexions with Mrs. Wall,
the favourite maid of the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth; and
fitz-harris hoped, if he per&s;i&s;ted in a &s;tory agreeable to
the Court, that &s;ome favour might on that account be
&s;hown to his family.</P>
<P>IT is amu&s;ing to reflect on the &s;everal lights, in which
this &s;tory has been repre&s;ented by the oppo&s;ite &s;actions.
The country party affirmed, that Fitz-harris had been
employed by the Court, in order to throw the odium of
<PB N="154" REF="196">
the libel on the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts, and thereby give ri&s;e to a
prote&s;tant plot: The court party maintained, that the
exclu&s;ioni&s;ts had found out Fitz-harris, a &s;py of the mini|&s;ters,
and had &s;et him upon this undertaking, from an
intention of loading the Court with the imputation of
&s;uch a de&s;ign upon the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts. Rather than acquit
their antagoni&s;ts, both &s;ides were willing to adopt an ac|count
the mo&s;t intricate and incredible. It was a &s;trange
&s;ituation, in which the people, at that time, were
placed; to be every day tortured with the&s;e perplexed &s;to|ries,
and inflamed with &s;uch dark &s;u$picions again&s;t their
fellow-citizens. This was no le&s;s than the fifteenth fal&s;e
plot, or &s;ham plot, as they were then called, with which
the court, it was imagined, had endeavoured to load their
adver&s;aries<NOTE N="i" PLACE="foot">College's trial.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE country party had intended to make u&s;e of Fitz|harris's
evidence again&s;t the Duke and the Catholics;
and his execution was therefore a great mortification to
them. But the King and his mini&s;ters were re&s;olved not
to be contented with &s;o &s;lender an advantage. They
were determined to pro&s;ecute the victory, and to employ
again&s;t the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts tho&s;e very offen&s;ive arms, how|ever
unfair, which that party had laid up in &s;tore again&s;t
their antagoni&s;ts. The whole gang of &s;pies, witne&s;&s;es, in|formers,
&s;uborners, who had &s;o long been &s;upported and
encouraged by the leading patriots, finding now that the
King was entirely ma&s;ter, turned &s;hort upon their old
patrons, and offered their &s;ervice to the mini&s;ters. To
the di&s;grace of the Court and of the age, they were re|ceived
with hearty welcome; and their te&s;timony or ra|ther
perjury made u&s;e of, in order to commit legal mur|der
upon the oppo&s;ite party. With an air of triumph and
deri&s;ion it was a&s;ked, &startq;Are not the&s;e men good witne&s;&s;es,
who have e&s;tabli&s;hed the popi&s;h plot, upon who&s;e te|&s;timony
Stafford and &s;o many Catholics have been ex|ecuted,
<PB N="155" REF="197">
and whom you your&s;elves have &s;o long cele|brated
as men of credit and veracity? You have ad|mitted
them into your bo&s;om: They are be&s;t acquainted
with your trea&s;on: They are determined in another
&s;hape to &s;erve their King and country: And you can|not
complain, that the &s;ame mea&s;ure, which you meted
to others, &s;hould now, by a righteous doom or ven|geance,
be mea&s;ured out to you.&endq;</P>
<P>IT is certain, that the principle of retaliation may &s;erve
in &s;ome ca&s;es as a full apology, in others as an alleviation,
for a conduct which would otherwi&s;e be expo&s;ed to great
blame. But the&s;e infamous arts, which poi&s;on ju&s;tice
in its very &s;ource, and break all the bands of human
&s;ociety, are &s;o dete&s;table and dangerous, that no pretence
of retalation can be pleaded as an apology or even an al|leviation
for the crime incurred by them. On the con|trary,
the greater indignation the King and his mini&s;ters,
felt, when formely expo&s;ed to the perjuries of abandoned
men, the more reluctance &s;hould they now have di&s;cove|red
again&s;t employing the &s;ame in&s;truments of vengeance
upon their antagoni&s;ts.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t per&s;on, on whom the mini&s;ters fell, was one
College, a London joiner, who had become extremely no|ted
for his zeal again&s;t popery, and was very much con|nected
with Shafte&s;bury and all the leaders of the country
party: For as they relied much upon the populace, men
of College's rank and &s;tation were very u&s;eful to them.
College had been in Oxford armed with &s;word and pi&s;tol
during the &s;itting of the Parliament; and this was made
the foundation of his crime. It was pretended that a
con&s;piracy had been entered into to &s;eize the King's per&s;on,
and retain him in confinement, till he &s;hould make the
conce&s;&s;ions demanded of him. The &s;heriffs of London
were in &s;trong oppo&s;ition to the Court; and it was not
&s;trange, that the grand jury named by them rejected the
bill again&s;t College. The pri&s;oner was therefore &s;ent to
<PB N="156" REF="198">
Oxford, where the trea&s;on was &s;aid to have been com|mitted.
Lord Norris, a courtier, was &s;heriff of the
county; and the inhabitants were in general extremely
devoted to the court party. A jury was named, con&s;i&s;t|ing
entirely of Royali&s;ts; and tho' they were men of
credit and character, yet &s;uch was the factious rage, which
prevailed, that little ju&s;tice could be expected by the pri|&s;oner.
Some papers, containing hints and directions for
his defence, were taken from him, as he was conducted
to his trial: An iniquity, which &s;ome pretended to ju&s;tify
by alleging, that a like violence had been committed
again&s;t a pri&s;oner during the fury of the popi&s;h plot.
Such wild notions of retaliation were at that time propa|gated
by the court party.</P>
<P>THE witne&s;&s;es produced again&s;t College were Dug|dale,
Turberville, Haynes, Smith; men who had be|fore
given evidence again&s;t the Catholics, and whom the
jury, for that very rea&s;on, regarded as the mo&s;t perjured
lyars. College, tho' be&s;et with &s;o many toils, oppre&s;&s;ed
with &s;o many iniquities, defended him&s;elf with &s;pirit,
courage, capacity, pre&s;ence of mind; and he invalidated
the evidence of the Crown, by the mo&s;t convincing ar|guments
and the mo&s;t undoubted te&s;timony: Yet did the
jury, after half an hour's deliberation, bring in a verdict
again&s;t him. The inhuman &s;pectators received the news
with a &s;hout of applau&s;e: But the pri&s;oner was no wi&s;e
di&s;mayed. At his execution, he maintained the &s;ame
manly fortitude, and &s;till denied the crime imputed to
him. His whole conduct and demeanour prove him to
have been a man led a&s;tray only by the fury of the times,
and to have been governed by a very hone&s;t, but indi&s;|creet
zeal for his country and his religion.</P>
<P>THUS the two parties, actuated by mutual rage, but
cooped up within the narrow limits of the law, levelled
with poi&s;oned daggers the mo&s;t deadly blows again&s;t each
other's brea&s;t, and buried in their factious divi&s;ions all re|gard
to truth, honour, and morality.</P>

of &s;o much loyalty, as well as probity, and honour, ex|cluded

intere&s;t with the King as to get Ormond recalled from
the government of Ireland; and lord Robarts, afterwards
earl of Radnor, &s;uccceded him in that important employ|ment.
Lord Berkly &s;ucceeded Robarts; and the earl of
E&s;&s;ex, Berkely. At la&s;t in the year 1677, Charles ca&s;t
his eyes again upon Ormond, whom he had &s;o long ne|glected;
and &s;ent him over lieutenant to Ireland. &startq;I have

thought it his duty, regularly, tho' with dignity, to
pay his court at Whitehall; and to prove that his at|tachments
were founded on gratitude, inclination, and
principle, not on any temporary advantages. All the
expre&s;&s;ions, which dropped from him, while neglected by

hours points right.&endq;</P>
<P>WHEN Charles found it his intere&s;t to &s;how favour to
the old Royali&s;ts and to the church of England, Ormond,
who was extremely revered by that whole party, could
not fail of recovering, together with the government of
Ireland, his former credit and authority. His admini|&s;tration,
when lord lieutenant, was corre&s;pondent to the
general tenor of his life; and tended equally to promote
the intere&s;t of Prince and people, of Prote&s;tant and Ca|tholic.
Ever firmly attached to the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion,
he was able, even during the&s;e jealous times, to e&s;cape
&s;u&s;picion, tho' he gratified not vulgar prejudices by any
per&s;ecution of the popi&s;h party. He encrea&s;ed the re|venue
of Ireland to three hundred thou&s;and pounds a year:
He maintained a regular army of ten thou&s;and men: He
&s;upported a well di&s;ciplined militia of twenty thou&s;and
And tho' the act of &s;ettlement had &s;o far been infringed
that Catholics were permitted to live in corporate towns
<PB N="159" REF="201">
they were guarded with &s;o careful an eye, that the mo&s;t timo|rous
Prote&s;tant never apprehended any danger from them.</P>
<P>THE chief object of E&s;&s;ex's ambition was to return
to the &s;tation of lord lieutenant, where he had behaved
with honour and integrity: Shafte&s;bury and Buckingham
bore an extreme hatred to Ormond, both from per&s;onal
and party con&s;iderations: The great aim of the anti|courtiers
was to throw reflections on every part of the
King's government. It could be no &s;urprize, therefore,
to the lord lieutenant to learn, that his admini&s;tration was
attacked in Parliament, particularly by Shafte&s;bury; but
he had the &s;atisfaction, at the &s;ame time, to hear of the keen,
tho' polite defence, made by his &s;on, the generous O&s;&s;ory. After Ju&s;tifying &s;everal particulars of Ormond's admini|&s;tration
again&s;t that intriguing patriot, O&s;&s;ory proceeded
in the following words: &startq;Having &s;poke of what the
lord lieutenant has done, I pre&s;ume with the &s;ame truth
to tell your lord&s;hips what he has not done. He never
advi&s;ed the breaking of the triple league; he never ad|vi&s;ed the &s;hutting up of the Exchequer; he never
advi&s;ed the declaration for a toleration; he never ad|vi&s;ed
the falling out with the Dutch and the joining
with France: He was not the author of that mo&s;t ex|cellent
po&s;ition <HI>Delenda e&s;t Carthago,</HI> that Holland, a
prote&s;tant country, &s;hould, contrary to the true inte|re&s;t
of England, be totally de&s;troyed. I beg, that
your lord&s;hips will be &s;o ju&s;t as judge of my father
and all men, according to their actions and their coun|cils.&endq;
The&s;e few &s;entences, pronounced by a plain
and gallant &s;oldier, noted for probity, had a &s;urprizing
effect upon the audience, and confounded all the rhe|toric
of his eloquent and factious adver&s;ary. The prince
of Orange, who e&s;teemed the former character as much
as he de&s;pi&s;ed the latter, could not forbear congratulating
by letter the earl of O&s;&s;ory on this new &s;pecies of victory,
which he had obtained.</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="202">
OSSORY, tho' he ever kept at a great di&s;tance from
faction, was the mo&s;t popular man in the kingdom; tho'
he never made any compliance with the corrupt views of
the Court, was extremely beloved and re&s;pected by the
King. An univer&s;al grief appeared on his death, which
happened about this time, and which the populace, as
is u&s;ual wherever they are much affected, fooli&s;hly a&s;cri|bed
to poi&s;on. Ormond bore the lo&s;s with patience
and dignity; tho' he ever retained a plea&s;ing, however
melancholy, &s;en&s;e of the &s;ignal merit of O&s;&s;ory. &startq;I
would not exchange my dead &s;on,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;for any
living &s;on in Chri&s;tendom.&endq;</P>
<P>THESE particularities may appear a digre&s;&s;ion; but
'tis with plea&s;ure, I own, that I relax my&s;elf for a mo|ment
in the contemplation of the&s;e humane and virtu|ous
characters, amid&s;t that &s;cene of fury and faction,
fraud and violence, in which at pre&s;ent our narration has
unfortunately engaged us.</P>
<P>BESIDES the general intere&s;t of the country party to
decry the conduct of all the King's mini&s;ters, the pru|dent
and peaceable admini&s;tration of Ormond was in a
particular manner di&s;plea&s;ing to them. In England,
where the Catholics were &s;carce one to a hundred, means
had been found to excite an univer&s;al panic, on account
of in&s;urrections and even ma&s;&s;acres, projected by that
&s;ect; and it could not but &s;eem &s;trange that in Ireland,
where they exceeded the Prote&s;tants ten to one, there
&s;hould no &s;ymptoms appear of any combination or con|&s;piracy.
Such an incident, when duly con&s;idered, might
even in England &s;hake the credit of the plot, and di|mini&s;h
the authority of tho&s;e leaders, who had &s;o long,
with &s;uch indu&s;try, inculcated the belief of it on the
nation. Rewards therefore were published in Ireland to any that would bring
intelligence or become witne&s;&s;es;
and &s;ome profligates were &s;ent over to that kingdom, with
a commi&s;&s;ion to &s;eek out evidence again&s;t the Catholics.
<PB N="161" REF="203">
Under pretence of &s;earching for arms or papers, they
broke into hou&s;es; and, plundered them: They threw
innocent men into pri&s;on, and took bribes for their re|lea&s;e:
And after all their diligence, it was with difficulty,
that that country; commonly fertile enough in witne&s;&s;es;
could furni&s;h them with any fit for their purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, a Certain Fitzgerald appeared, followed by
two Macnamaras, Ivey, San&s;on, Dennis, Bourke, and
&s;ome others. The&s;e men were immediately &s;ent over to
England; and tho' they po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed neither character, &s;uf|ficient
to gain belief even for truth, nor &s;en&s;e to invent
a credible fal&s;hood they were care&s;&s;ed rewarded, &s;up|ported,
and recommended by the earl of Shafte&s;bury.
Oliver Plunket, the titular primate of Ireland, a man of
very peaceable di&s;po&s;itions, was condemned and exe|cuted
upon &s;uch te&s;timony. And the Oxford-Parliament
entered &s;o far into the matter as to vote that they were
entirely &s;atisfied in the reality of the <HI>horrid</HI> and <HI>damnable</HI>
Iri&s;h plot. But &s;uch deci&s;ions, tho' at fir&s;t regarded as
Infallible, had now lo&s;t much of their authority; and
the public &s;till remained &s;omewhat indifferent and incre|dulous.</P>
<P>AFTER the di&s;&s;olution of the Parliament, and the &s;ub|&s;equent
victory of the Royali&s;ts, Shafte&s;bury's evidences,
with Turberville, Smith, and others, addre&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves
to the mini&s;ters, and gave information of high
trea&s;on again&s;t their former patron. It is &s;ufficiently
&s;candalous, that intelligence, conveyed by &s;uch men,
&s;hould have been attended to; but there is &s;ome rea&s;on
to think, that the Court agents, nay the mini&s;ters, nay
the King him&s;elf<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">See captain Wilkin&s;on's Narrative.</NOTE>, went farther, and were active in en|deavouring,
tho' in vain, to find more reputable per&s;ons
to &s;upport the bla&s;ted credit of the Iri&s;h witne&s;&s;es. Shafte&s;|bury
was committed to pri&s;on, and his indictment was
pre&s;ented to the grand jury. The new &s;heriffs of Lon|don
<PB N="162" REF="204">
don, Shute and Pilkington, were engaged as deeply as
their predece&s;&s;ors in the country party; and they took
care to name a jury extremely devoted to the &s;ame cau&s;e:
A precaution quite requi&s;ite, when it was &s;carce po&s;&s;ible
to find men indifferent or attached to neither party. As
far as &s;wearing could go, the trea&s;on was clearly proved
again&s;t Shafte&s;bury; or rather &s;o clearly as to merit no
kind of credit or attention.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shafte&s;bury acquitted.</NOTE> That veteran leader of a
party, enured from his early youth to faction and in|trigue,
to cabals and con&s;piracies, was repre&s;ented as open|ing
without re&s;erve his trea&s;onable intentions to the&s;e
ob&s;cure banditti, and throwing out &s;uch violent and out|rageous
reproaches upon the King, as none but men of
low education, like them&s;elves, could be &s;upp|&s;ed to
employ. The draught of an a&s;&s;ociation, it is true,
again&s;t popery and the Duke, was found in Shafte&s;|bury's
cabinet; and dangerous inferences might be
drawn from many clau&s;es of that paper. But it
did not appear that it had been framed by Shafte&s;|bury,
or &s;o much as approved by him. And as projects of an a&s;&s;ociation had been propo&s;ed in Parlia|ment,
it was very natural for that nobleman to be think|ing
of &s;ome plan, which it might be proper to lay before
that a&s;&s;embly. The grand jury, therefore, after weigh|ing
all the&s;e circum&s;tances, rejected the indictment; and
the people, who attended the hall, te&s;tified their joy, by
the loude&s;t acclamations, which were echoed thro' the
whole city.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time a &s;cheme of oppre&s;&s;ion was laid in
Scotland, after a manner &s;till more flagrant, again&s;t a
nobleman much le&s;s obnoxious than Shafte&s;bury; and as
that country was reduced almo&s;t to a &s;tate of total &s;ub|jection,
the project had the fortune to &s;ucceed.</P>
<P>THE earl of Argyle, from his youth, had di&s;tingui&s;h|ed
him&s;elf by his loyalty,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle's trial.</NOTE> and his attachment to the royal
family. Tho' his father was head of the Covenanters,
<PB N="163" REF="205">
he refu&s;ed to concur in any of their mea&s;ures; and when
a commi&s;&s;ion of colonel was given him by the conven|tion
of &s;tates, he forbore to act upon it, till it &s;hould be
ratified by the King. By his re&s;pectful behaviour, as
well as by his &s;ervices, he made him&s;elf very acceptable to
Charles, when that Prince was in Scotland; and even
after the battle of Worce&s;ter, all the misfortunes, which
attended the royal cau&s;e, could not engage him to de&s;ert it.
Under Middleton he ob&s;tinately per&s;evered to harra&s;s
and infe&s;t the victorious Engli&s;h; and it was not till he
received orders from that general, that he would &s;ubmit
to accept of a capitulation. Such jealou&s;y of his loyal
attachments was entertained by the Commonwealth and
Protestor, that a pretence was &s;oon after fallen upon to
commit him to pri&s;on; and his confinement was rigo|rou&s;ly
continued till the restoration. The King, &s;en&s;ible
of his &s;ervices, had remitted to him his father's forfeiture,
and created him earl of Argyle; and when a mo&s;t unju&s;t
&s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed upon him by the Scots Parliament,
Charles had anew remitted it. In the &s;ub&s;equent part of
the reign, Argyle behaved him&s;elf dutifully; and tho' he
&s;eemed not di&s;po&s;ed to go all lengths with the Court, he
always appeared, even in his oppo&s;ition, a man of mild
di&s;po&s;itions and peaceable deportment.</P>
<P>A PARLIAMENT was &s;ummoned at Edinburgh this
&s;ummer, and the Duke was appointed commi&s;&s;ioner. Be|&s;ides
granting money to the king and voting the indefea|&s;ible
right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, this Parliament enacted a te&s;t,
which all per&s;ons, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of offices, civil, military, or
eccle&s;ia&s;tical, were bound to take. In this te&s;t, the
King's &s;upremacy was affirmed, the covenant renounced,
pa&s;&s;ive obedience a&s;&s;ented to, and all obligations di&s;|claimed
of endeavouring any alterations in church or
&s;tate. This was the &s;tate of the te&s;t, as propo&s;ed by the
courtiers: but the country party propo&s;ed al&s;o a clau&s;e
of adherence to the prote&s;tant religion, which could not
<PB N="164" REF="206">
with decency be refu&s;ed. The whole was of an enor|mous
length con&s;idered as an oath; and what was wor&s;e,
a confe&s;&s;ion of faith was there ratified; which had been
impo&s;ed a little after the reformation, and which contain|ed
a great many articles, altogether forgot by the Par|liament
and nation. Among others, the doctrine of re|&s;i&s;tance
was inculcated; &s;o that the te&s;t, being voted in
a hurry, was found on examination to be a medley of
contradiction and ab&s;urdity. Several per&s;ons, the mo&s;t
attached to the Crown, &s;erupled to take it. The bi&s;hops
and many of the clergy remon&s;trated: The earl of
Qucen&s;bury refu&s;ed to &s;wear, except he might be allow|ed
to add an explanation: And even the privy council
thought it nece&s;&s;ary to publi&s;h for general &s;atisfaction a
&s;olution of &s;ome difficulties, attending the te&s;t.</P>
<P>Tho' the courtiers could not reject the clau&s;e of adhe|rence
to the prote&s;tant religion, they propo&s;ed, as a re|qur&s;ite
mark of re&s;pect, that all Princes of the blood
&s;hould be exempted from taking that oath. This excep|tion
was zealou&s;ly oppo&s;ed by Argyle, who ob&s;erved,
that the &s;ole danger to be dreaded for the prote&s;tant reli|gion
mu&s;t proceed from the perver&s;ion of the royal family.
By in&s;i&s;ting on &s;uch topics, he drew on him&s;elf the &s;ecret
indignation of the Duke, of which he &s;oon felt the fatal
effects.</P>
<P>WHEN Argyle took the te&s;t as a privy coun&s;ellor, he
&s;ubjoined, in the Duke's pre&s;ence, an explanation,
which he had beforehand communicated to that Prince,
and which he believed to have been approved by him. It
was in the&s;e words. &startq;I have con&s;idered the te&s;t, and
am very de&s;irous of giving obedience as far as I can. I
am confident, that the Parliament never intended to
impo&s;e contradictory oaths: Therefore I think no
man can explain it but for him&s;elf. Accordingly, I
take it as far as it is con&s;i&s;tent with it&s;elf, and the prote|&s;tant
religion. And I do declare, that I mean not to
<PB N="165" REF="207">
bind up my&s;elf, in my &s;tation, and in a lawful way,
from wi&s;hing and endeavouring any alteration, which
I think to the advantage of church or &s;tate, and not
repugnant to the prote&s;tant religion and my loyalty:
And this I under&s;tand as a part of my oath.&endq; The
Duke, as was natural, heard the&s;e words with great
tranquillity: no one took the lea&s;t offence: Argyle was
admitted to &s;it that day in council: And it was impo&s;&s;ible
to imagine, that a capital offence had been committed,
where occa&s;ion &s;eemed not to have been given, &s;o much
as for a frown or reprimand.</P>
<P>ARGYLE was much &s;urprized, a few days after, to
find that a warrant was i&s;&s;ued for committing him to pri|&s;on;
that he was indicted for high trea&s;on, lea&s;ing-mak|ing
and perjury; and that from the&s;e innocent words an
accu&s;ation was extracted, by which he was to forfeit ho|nours,
life, and fortune. It is needle&s;s to enter into
particulars, where the iniquity of the whole is &s;o appa|rent.
Tho' the &s;word of ju&s;tice was di&s;played, even
her &s;emblance was not put on; and the forms alone of
law were pre&s;erved, in order to &s;anctify, or rather aggra|vate
the oppre&s;&s;ion. Of five judges, three did not &s;cru|ple
to find the guilt of trea&s;on and lea&s;ing-making to be
incurred by the pri&s;oner: A jury of fifteen noblemen
gave verdict again&s;t him: And the King, being con|&s;ulted,
ordered the &s;entence to be pronounced; but the
execution of it to be &s;u&s;pended, till farther plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>IT was pretended by the Duke and his creatures, that
Argyle's life and fortune were not in any danger, and that
the &s;ole rea&s;on for pu&s;hing the trial to &s;uch extremities
again&s;t him was in order to make him renounce &s;ome
hereditary juri&s;dictions, which gave his family a dange|rous
authority in the Highlands, and checked the cour&s;e
of public ju&s;tice. But allowing the end to be ju&s;tifiable,
the means were infamous; and &s;uch as were incompa|tible,
not only with a free, but a civilized government,
<PB N="166" REF="208">
Argyle had therefore no rea&s;on to tru&s;t any longer to the
ju&s;tice or mercy of &s;uch enemies: He made his e&s;cape
from pri&s;on; and till he &s;hould find a &s;hip for Holland,
he concealed him&s;elf during &s;ome time in London. The
King heard of his lurking-place, but would not allow
him to be arre&s;ted<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 522.</NOTE>. All the parts however of his &s;en|tence,
&s;o far as the government in Scotland had power,
were rigorou&s;ly executed; his e&s;tate confi&s;cated, his arms
rever&s;ed and torne.</P>
<P>IT would &s;eem,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of affairs in Scotland.</NOTE> that the genuine pa&s;&s;ion for liberty was
at this time totally extingui&s;hed in Scotland: There was
only pre&s;erved a &s;pirit of mutiny and &s;edition, encouraged
by a mi&s;taken zeal for religion. Cameron and Cargil,
two furious preachers, went a &s;tep beyond all their bre|thren:
They publickly excommunicated the King for his
tyranny and his breach of the covenant, and renounced all
allegiance to him. Cameron was killed by the troops in an
action at Airs-Mo&s;s; Cargil was taken and hanged. Many
of their followers were tried and convicted. Their lives
were offered them if they would &s;ay <HI>God &s;ave the King:</HI>
But they would only agree to pray for his repentance.
This ob&s;tinacy was much in&s;i&s;ted on as an apology for
the rigors of the admini&s;tration: But, if duly con&s;idered,
it will rather afford rea&s;on for a contrary inference. Such
unhappy delu&s;ion is an object rather of commi&s;eration
than of anger; And it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible, that men
could have been carried to &s;uch a degree of madne&s;s, un|le&s;s
provoked by a long train of violence and oppre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>AS the King was ma&s;ter in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1682.</NOTE> and no longer
dreaded the clamours of the country party, he permitted
the Duke to pay him a vi&s;it; and was &s;oon after prevailed
on to allow of his return to England, and of his bearing
a part in the admini&s;tration. The Duke went to Scot|land
in order to bring up his family, and &s;ettle the go|vernment
<PB N="167" REF="209">
of that country; and he cho&s;e to take his pa&s;|&s;age
by &s;ea. The &s;hip &s;truck on a &s;and-bank, and was
lo&s;t: The Duke e&s;caped in the barge; and it is pretended,
that, while many per&s;ons of rank and quality were
drowned, and among the re&s;t, Hyde, his brother-in-law,
he was very careful to &s;ave &s;everal of his dogs and prie&s;ts:
For the&s;e two &s;pecies of favourites are coupled together
by &s;ome writers. It has likewi&s;e been a&s;&s;erted, that the
barge might &s;afely have held more per&s;ons, and that &s;ome
who &s;wam to it were thru&s;t off, and even their hands cut
in order to di&s;engage them. But every action of every
eminent per&s;on, during this period, is &s;o liable to be mi&s;|interpreted
and mi&s;repre&s;ented by faction, that we ought
to be very cautious of pa&s;&s;ing our judgment on too &s;light
an evidence. It is remarkable, that the &s;ailors on board
the &s;hip, though they felt them&s;elves &s;inking, and &s;aw
inevitable death before their eyes, yet &s;o &s;oon as they ob|&s;erved
the Duke to be in &s;afety, gave a loud &s;hout, in
te&s;timony of their joy and &s;atisfaction.</P>
<P>THE Duke, during his abode in Scotland, had be|haved
with great civility towards the gentry and nobi|lity:
and by his courtly demeanour had much won upon
their affections: But his treatment of the enthu&s;ia&s;ts was
&s;till &s;omewhat rigorous; and in many in&s;tances he ap|peared
to be a man of a &s;evere, if not an unrelenting
temper. It is even a&s;&s;erted, that he u&s;ually a&s;&s;i&s;ted with
his pre&s;ence at the torture of criminals, and looked on
with tranquillity, as if he were con&s;idering &s;ome curious
experiment<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 583. Wodrow, vol. ii. p. 169. This la&s;t author, who is much the better authority, mentions only one in&s;tance, that of Spreul, which &s;eems to have been an extraordinary one.</NOTE>. He left the authority in the hands of the
earl of Aberdeen, chancellor, and the earl of Queen&s;|bury,
trea&s;urer: A very arbitrary &s;pirit appeared in their
admini&s;tration. A gentleman of the name of Weir was
tried, becau&s;e he had kept company with one who had
<PB N="168" REF="210">
been in the rebellion; though that per&s;on had never been
marked out by proce&s;s or proclamation. The inferences
upon which Weir was condemned (for a pro&s;ecution by
the government and a condemnation were in Scotland the
&s;ame thing) hung upon each other, after the following
manner. No man, it was &s;uppo&s;ed, could have been in a
rebellion, without being expo&s;ed to &s;u&s;picion in the neigh|bourhood:
If the neighbourhood had &s;u&s;pected him, it
was to be pre&s;umed, that each individual had likewi&s;e
heard of the grounds of &s;u&s;picion: Every man was bound
to declare to the government his &s;u&s;picion again&s;t every
man, and to avoid the company of traitors: To fail in
this duty was to participate in the trea&s;on: The conclu|sion
on the whole was, You have conver&s;ed with a rebel,
therefore you are your&s;elf a rebel. A reprieve was with
&s;ome difficulty procured for Weir; but it was &s;eriou&s;ly
determined to make u&s;e of the precedent. Courts of ju|dicature
were erected in the &s;outhern and we&s;tern coun|ties,
and a &s;trict inqui&s;ition carried on again&s;t this new
&s;pecies of crime. The term of three years was pre&s;cribed
for the continuance of the&s;e courts; after which an in|demnity
was promi&s;ed. Whoever would take the te&s;t,
was in&s;tantly entitled to the benefit of this indemnity.
The Pre&s;byterians, alarmed with &s;uch tyranny, from
which no man could deem him&s;elf &s;afe, began to think
of leaving the country; and &s;ome of their agents were
lent to England, in order to treat with the proprietors of
Carolina for a &s;ettlement in that colony. Any condition
&s;eemed preferable to the living in their native country,
which, by the prevalence of persecution and violence,
was become as in&s;ecure to them as a den of robbers.</P>
<P>ABOVE two thou&s;and per&s;ons were out-lawed on pre|tence
of their conver&s;ing or having intercour&s;e with re|bels<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Wodrow, vol. ii. Appendix, 94.</NOTE>,
and they were continually hunted in their retreats
<PB N="169" REF="211">
by &s;oldiers, &s;pies, informers, and oppre&s;&s;ive magi&s;trates.
It was u&s;ual to put en&s;naring que&s;tions to people, living
peaceably in their own hou&s;es; &s;uch as, &startq;Will you re|nounce
the Covenant? Do you e&s;teem the ri&s;ing at
Bothwel to be rebellion? Was the killing the arch|bi&s;hop
of St. Andrew's a murder?&endq; And when the
poor deluded creatures refu&s;ed to an&s;wer, capital puni&s;h|ments
were inflicted on them<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">Wodrow, vol. ii. pa&s;&s;im.</NOTE>. Even women were
brought to the gibbet for this pretended crime. A num|ber
of fugitives, rendered frantic by oppre&s;&s;ion, had
publi&s;hed a &s;editious declaration; renouncing allegiance
to Charles Stuart, whom they called, as they, for their
parts, had indeed &s;ome rea&s;on to e&s;teem him, a tyrant.
This incident afforded the privy council a pretence for a
very unu&s;ual kind of oppre&s;&s;ion. Soldiers were di&s;per&s;ed
over the country, and power was given to all commi&s;&s;ion
officers, even the mo&s;t inferior, to oblige every one
whom they met with, to abjure the declaration; and
upon refu&s;al, in&s;tantly, without farther que&s;tions, to
&s;hoot the delinquent<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">Id. vol. ii. p. 434.</NOTE>. It were endle&s;s, as well as
&s;hocking, to enumerate all the in&s;tances of per&s;ecution,
or, in other words, of ab&s;urd tyranny, which at that
time prevailed in Scotland. One of them however is &s;o
&s;ingular, that I cannot forbear relating it.</P>
<P>THREE women were &s;eized<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">Id. vol. ii. p. 505.</NOTE>; and the cu&s;tomary oath
was tendered to them, by which they were to abjure the
&s;editious declaration above-mentioned. They all refu&s;ed,
and were condemned to a capital puni&s;hment by drown|ing.
One of them was an elderly woman: The other
two were very young; one eighteen years of age, the
other only thirteen. Even the&s;e violent per&s;ecutors were
a&s;hamed to put the younge&s;t to death: But the other two
were conducted to the place of execution, and were tied
to &s;takes within the &s;ea-mark at low water: A contrivance,
<PB N="170" REF="212">
which rendered their death lingering and dreadful. The
elderly woman was placed farthe&s;t in, and by the ri&s;ing
of the waters was fir&s;t &s;uffocated. The younger partly
terrified with the view of her companion's death, partly
&s;ubdued by the entreaty of her friends, was prevailed
with to &s;ay <HI>God &s;ave the King.</HI> Immediately the &s;pectators
called out, that &s;he had &s;ubmitted; and &s;he was loo&s;ened
from the &s;take. Major Winram, the officer who guarded
the execution, again required her to &s;ign the abjuration;
and upon her refu&s;al, he ordered her in&s;tantly to be
plunged in the water, where &s;he was &s;uffocated.</P>
<P>THE &s;everity of the admini&s;tration in Scotland is in
part to be a&s;cribed to the Duke's temper, to whom the
King had con&s;igned over the government of that coun|try,
and who gave &s;uch attention to affairs as to allow
nothing of importance to e&s;cape him. Even the go|vernment
of England from the &s;ame cau&s;e began &s;ome|what
to be infected with the &s;ame &s;everity. The Duke's
credit was very great at Court. Tho' neither &s;o much
beloved nor e&s;teemed as the King, he was more dreaded;
and thence an attendance more exact, as well as a &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion
more ob&s;equious, was paid him. The &s;aying of
Waller was remarked, that Charles, in &s;pite to the Par|liament,
who had determined, that the Duke &s;hould not
&s;ucceed him, was re&s;olved, that he &s;hould reign even in
his lifetime.</P>
<P>THE King however, who loved to maintain a balance
in his councils, &s;till &s;upported Halifax, whom he created
a marque&s;s, and made lord privy &s;eal; tho' ever in op|po&s;ition
to the Duke.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the Mini&s;try in England.</NOTE> This man, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the
fine&s;t genius and mo&s;t exten&s;ive capacity, of all employed
in public affairs during the pre&s;ent reign, affected a &s;pe|cies
of neutrality between the parties, and was e&s;teemed
the head of that &s;mall body, known by the denomination
of <HI>Trimmers.</HI> This conduct, which is much more na|tural
to men of integrity than of ambition, could not
<PB N="171" REF="213">
however procure him the former character; and he was
always with rea&s;on, regarded as an intriguer rather than
a patriot. Sunderland, who had promoted the exclu&s;ion|bill,
and who had been di&s;placed on that account, was
again, with the Duke's con&s;ent, brought into the admi|ni&s;tration.
The extreme duplicity, at lea&s;t variablene&s;s,
of this man's conduct thro' the whole cour&s;e of his life,
made it be &s;u&s;pected, that it was by the King's direction
he had mixed with the country party. Hyde, created
earl of Roche&s;ter, was fir&s;t commi&s;&s;ioner of the trea&s;ury,
and was entirely in the Duke's intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THE King him&s;elf was obliged to act as the head of
a party; a di&s;agreeable &s;ituation for a Prince, and always
the &s;ource of much inju&s;tice and oppre&s;&s;ion. He knew
how obnoxious the di&s;&s;enters were to the church; and
he re&s;olved, contrary to the maxims of toleration, which
he had hitherto &s;upported in England, to gratify his
friends by the per&s;ecution of his enemies. The laws
again&s;t conventicles were now rigorou&s;ly executed; an
expedient, which, the King knew, would neither dimi|nish
the numbers nor influence of the Nonconformi&s;ts;
and which is therefore to be deemed more the re&s;ult of
pa&s;&s;ion than of policy. Scarce any per&s;ecution &s;erves the
intended purpo&s;e but &s;uch as amounts to a total extermi|nation.</P>
<P>Tho' the King's authority made every day great ad|vances,
it &s;till met with con&s;iderable ob&s;tacles, chiefly
from the city, which was entirely in the hands of the
malecontents.<NOTE PLACE="marg">New nomi|nation of &s;heriffs.</NOTE> The juries, in particular, named by the

trea&s;on, it was apprehended, might there be com|mitted
with impunity. There could not therefore be a
more important &s;ervice to the Court than to put affairs
a different footing. Sir John Moor, lord mayor,

was gained by &s;ecretary Jenkins, and encouraged to in&s;i&s;t
upon the cu&s;tomary privilege of his office, of naming one
of the &s;heriffs. Accordingly, when the time of election
came, he drank to North, a Levant merchant, who ac|cepted
that expen&s;ive office. The country party &s;aid,
that, being lately returned from Turkey, he was, on
account of his recent experience, better qualified to &s;erve
the purpo&s;es of the Court. A poll was opened for the
election of another &s;heriff; and here began the conte&s;t.
The majority of the common-hall, headed by the two
&s;heriffs of the former year, refu&s;ed to acknowledge
the mayor's right of nominating one &s;heriff, but in&s;i&s;ted
that both mu&s;t be elected by the liveries.<NOTE PLACE="marg">24th of June.</NOTE> Papillon and
Dubois were the per&s;ons whom the country party agreed
to elect: Box was pointed out by the courtiers. Books
were accordingly opened for the poll; but as the mayor
would not allow the elections to proceed for two vacan|cies,
the &s;heriffs and he &s;eparated, and each carried on
the poll apart. The country party, who voted with the
&s;heriffs for Papillon, and Dubois, were much more nu|merous
than tho&s;e who voted with the mayor for Box.
But as the mayor in&s;i&s;ted, that his books were the only
legal ones, he declared Box to be duly elected. All dif|ficulties
however were not &s;urmounted. Box, apprehen|&s;ive
of the con&s;equences of &s;o dubious an election, fined
off; and the mayor found it requi&s;ite to proceed to a
new election. When the matter was propo&s;ed to the
common-hall, a loud cry was rai&s;ed, No election! No
election! The two &s;heriffs already elected, Papillon and
Dubois, were in&s;i&s;ted on as the only legal magi&s;trates.
But as the mayor &s;till maintained, that Box alone had
been legally cho&s;en, and that it was now requi&s;ite to &s;up|ply
his place, he opened books anew, and during the
tumult, and confu&s;ion of the citizens, a few of the
mayor's partizans elected Rich, unknown to and un|heeded
by the re&s;t of the liveries. North and Rich were
<PB N="173" REF="217">
accordingly &s;worn &s;heriffs for the en&s;uing year; but it
was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end a guard of the train bands to pro|tect
them in the entering upon their office.<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of Oc|tober.</NOTE> A new mayor
of the court party was &s;oon after cho&s;en by means, as is
pretended, much more violent and irregular.</P>
<P>THUS the country party were di&s;lodged from their
&s;trong hold in the city, where, ever &s;ince the commence|ment
of factions in the Engli&s;h government, they had,
without interruption, almo&s;t without mole&s;tation, main|tained
a &s;uperiority. It had been happy, had the parti|alities,
hitherto objected to juries, been corrected, with|out
giving place to partialites of an opposite kind: But
in the pre&s;ent di&s;tracted &s;tate of the nation, an equitable
neutrality was almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be attained. The
court and church party, who were now named on juries,
made ju&s;tice &s;ub&s;ervient to their factious views; and the King
had a pro&s;pect of obtaining full revenge on his enemies. It
was not long before the effects of the&s;e alterations were
&s;een. When it was fir&s;t reported, that the Duke intended to
leave Scotland, Pilkington, at that time &s;heriff, a very
violent man, had broke out in the&s;e terms, &startq;He has
already burned the city, and is he now coming to
cut all our throats?&endq; For the&s;e &s;candalous expre&s;&s;ions,
the Duke &s;ued Pilkington; and enormous damages,
to the amount of 100,000 pounds, were decreed him.
By the law of England, ratified in the great charter,
no fine ought to extend to the total ruin of a criminal.
Sir Patience Ward, formerly mayor, who gave evidence
for Pilkington, was &s;ued for perjury, and condemned to
the pillory: A &s;evere &s;entence, and &s;ufficient to deter all
witne&s;&s;es from appearing in favour of tho&s;e, who were
pro&s;ecuted by the Court.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the crown had obtained &s;o great a victory
in the city,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1683.</NOTE> it was not quite deci&s;ive; and the conte&s;t
might be renewed every year at the election of magi&s;trates.
<PB N="174" REF="218">
An important project therefore was formed, riot only to
make the King ma&s;ter of the city but by that example
to gain him the a&s;cendant in all the corporations of Eng|land,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Quo war|ran$os.</NOTE>
and thereby give the greate&s;t wound to the legal
con&s;titution, which the mo&s;t powerful and mo&s;t arbitrary
Monarchs had ever yet been able to inflict. All the Roya|li&s;ts,
tho' Engli&s;hmen, and even, to a certain degree,
lovers of liberty, were yet induced, from enmity to the
oppo&s;ite faction, and from the de&s;ire of &s;uperiority, to
concur in this violent mea&s;ure. A writ of <HI>quo warranto</HI>
was i&s;&s;ued again&s;t the city; that is, an enquiry into the
validity of their charter. It was pretended that the city
had forfeited all its privileges, and ought to be declared
no longer a corporation, on account of two offences;
which the court of aldermen and common council had
committed. After the great fire in 1666, all the mar|kets
had been rebuilt and had been fitted up with many
conveniencies; and in order to defray the expence, the
magi&s;trates had impo&s;ed a &s;mall toll on &s;uch as brought
any goods to market. In the year 1679, they had ad|dre&s;&s;ed
the King again&s;t the prorogation of Parliament,
and had employed the following terms. &startq;Your peti|tioners
are greatly &s;urprized at the late prorogation,
whereby the pro&s;ecution of the public ju&s;tice of the
kingdom, and the making nece&s;&s;ary provi&s;ions for the
pre&s;ervation of your Maje&s;ty and your prote&s;tant &s;ub|jects,
have received interruption.&endq; The&s;e words were
pretended to contain a &s;candalous reflection on the King
and his mea&s;ures. The cau&s;e of the city was defended
again&s;t the attorney and &s;ollicitor generals, by Treby and
Pollexfen.</P>
<P>THESE la&s;t pleaded, that, &s;ince the foundation of the
Monarchy, no corporation had ever yet been forfeited,
and the thing it&s;elf implied an ab&s;urdity: That a corpo|ration,
as &s;uch, was incapable of all crime or offence,
and none was an&s;werable for any iniquity but the per&s;ons
<PB N="175" REF="219">
them&s;elves, who committed it: That the members, in
choo&s;ing magi&s;trates, had entru&s;ted them only with legal
powers; and where the magi&s;trates had exceeded-the&s;e
powers, their acts were void, but could never involve
the body it&s;elf in any criminal imputation: That &s;uch
had ever been the practice of England, except at the
Reformation, when the mona&s;teries were forfeited; but
this was an extraordinary ca&s;e; and it was even thought
nece&s;&s;ary afterwards to ratify the whole tran&s;action by
act of Parliament: That corporate bodies, framed for
public good, and calculated for perpetual duration,
ought not to be annihilated for the temporary faults of
their members, who might them&s;elves, without hurting
the community, be que&s;tioned for their offences: That
even a private e&s;tate, if entailed, could not be forfeited
to the Crown, on account of trea&s;on, committed by the
tenant for life; but upon his demi&s;e went to the next in
remainder: That the offences, objected to the city, far
from de&s;erving &s;o &s;evere a puni&s;hment, were not even
worthy of the &s;malle&s;t reprehen&s;ion: That all corpora|tions
were inve&s;ted with the power of making bye-laws;
and the &s;malle&s;t burrough in England had ever been al|lowed
to carry the exerci&s;e of this power farther than
London had done in the in&s;tance complained of: That
the city, having, at their own expence, repaired the mar|kets,
which were built too on their own e&s;tates, might
as lawfully claim a &s;mall recompence from &s;uch as
brought commodities thither, as a man might require rent
for a hou&s;e, which he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of: That tho&s;e who
di&s;liked the condition, might ab&s;tain from the market;
and whoever paid, had done it voluntarily: That it was
an avowed right of the &s;ubjects to petition; nor had the
city in their addre&s;s abu&s;ed this privilege: That the King
him&s;elf had often declared, the Parliament often voted,
the nation to be in danger from the popi&s;h plot; which,
it is evident could not be fully pro&s;ecuted but in a par|liamentary
<PB N="176" REF="220">
manner: That the impeachment of the popi&s;h
lords was certainly ob&s;tructed by the frequent proroga|tions;
as was al&s;o the enacting of nece&s;&s;ary laws, and
providing for the defence of the nation: That the loyalty
of the city, no le&s;s than their regard to &s;elf-pre&s;ervation,
might prompt them to frame the petition; &s;ince it was
acknowledged, that the King's life was every moment
expo&s;ed to the mo&s;t imminent danger from the popi&s;h
con&s;piracy: That the city had not accu&s;ed the King of
ob&s;tructing ju&s;tice, much le&s;s of having any &s;uch inten|tion;
&s;ince it was allowed, that evil counsellors were
alone an&s;werable for all the pernicious con&s;equences of
any mea&s;ure: And that it was unaccountable, that two
public deeds, which had not, during &s;o long a time,
&s;ubjected to any, even the &s;malle&s;t penalty, the per&s;ons
guilty of them, &s;hould now be puni&s;hed &s;o &s;everely upon
the corporation, which always was, and always mu&s;t be
innocent.</P>
<P>IT is evident, that tho&s;e who would apologize for the
mea&s;ures of the court, mu&s;t, in this ca&s;e, found their
arguments, not on law, but rea&s;ons of &s;tate. The
judges,<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of June.</NOTE> therefore, who condemned the city, are totally
inexcu&s;able; &s;ince the &s;ole ju&s;tifiable object of their de|terminations
mu&s;t ever be the pure principles of ju&s;tice
and equity. But the place of judge was at that time
held during plea&s;ure; and it was impo&s;&s;ible, that any
cau&s;e, where the Court bent its force, could ever be car|ried
again&s;t it. After &s;entence was pronounced, the city
applied in a very humble manner to the King; and he
agreed to re&s;tore their charter, but in return they were
obliged to &s;ubmit to the following regulations: That no
lord mayor, &s;heriff, recorder, common &s;erjeant, town
clerk, or coroner &s;hould be admitted to the exerci&s;e of
his office without his Maje&s;ty's approbation: That if the
King di&s;approve twice of the mayor or &s;heriffs elected,
he may by commi&s;&s;ion appoint the&s;e magi&s;trates: That
<PB N="177" REF="221">
the lord mayor and court of aldermen may, with his Ma|je&s;ty's
leave, di&s;place any magi&s;trate: And that no al|derman,
in ca&s;e of a vacancy, &s;hall be elected without
con&s;ent of the court of aldermen, who, if they di&s;ap|prove
twice of the choice, may fill the vacancy.</P>
<P>ALL the corporations in England,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Great pow|er of the Crown.</NOTE> having the example
of London before their eyes, &s;aw how vain it would
prove to &s;truggle with the Court, and were, mo&s;t of
them, &s;ucce&s;&s;ively induced to &s;urrender their charters into
the King's hands. Con&s;iderable &s;ums were exacted for
re&s;toring the charters; and all the offices of power and
profit were left at the di&s;po&s;al of the Crown. Tho&s;e
who judge of the actions of princes by the rules of po|licy
alone, could excu&s;e tho&s;e mea&s;ures of the King, by
which he much extended his authority, and acquired a
great a&s;cendant in every burrough and corporation.
But it &s;eems &s;trange, that the independant royali&s;ts, who
never meant to make the Crown ab&s;olute, &s;hould yet be
&s;o elated with the victory obtained over their adver&s;aries,
as to approve of a precedent, which left no national pri|vileges
in &s;ecurity, but enabled the King, under like pre|tences,
and by means of like instruments, to recall anew
all tho&s;e charters, which at pre&s;ent he was plea&s;ed to
grant. And every friend to liberty mu&s;t allow, that the
nation, who&s;e con&s;titution was thus &s;hattered in the
&s;hock of faction, had a right, by every prudent expedi|ent,
to recover that &s;curity, of which it was &s;o unhap|pily
bereaved.</P>
<P>WHILE &s;o great a faction adhered to the Crown, it is
apparent, that re&s;i&s;tance, however ju&s;tifiable, could ne|ver
be prudent; and all wi&s;e men &s;aw no other expedient
but peaceably to &s;ubmit to the pre&s;ent grievances. There
was however a party of malecontents, &s;o turbulent in
their di&s;po&s;ition, that even before this la&s;t iniquity, which
laid the whole con&s;titution at the mercy of the King,
they had meditated plans of re&s;i&s;tance; at a time when
<PB N="178" REF="222">
it could be as little ju&s;tifiable as prudent. In the &s;pring

Monmouth's declaration publi&s;hed in the next reign, con&s;e&s;&s;es a con&s;ult for extraordinary remedies.</NOTE>, a little before the Oxford Parliament, the King
was &s;eized with a fit of &s;ickne&s;s at Wind&s;or, which gave
great alarm to the public.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A con&s;pi|racy.</NOTE> The Duke of Monmouth,
lord Ru&s;&s;el, lord Grey, in&s;tigated by the re&s;tle&s;s Shafte&s;|bury,
had agreed, in ca&s;e the King's &s;ickne&s;s &s;hould prove
mortal, to ri&s;e in arms and oppo&s;e the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the
Duke. Charles recovered; but the&s;e dangerous projects
were not laid a&s;ide. The &s;ame con&s;pirators, together
with E&s;&s;ex and Sali&s;bury, were determined to continue
the Oxford Parliament, after the King, as was daily ex|pected,
&s;hould di&s;&s;olve it; and they engaged &s;ome lea|ders
among the Commons in the &s;ame de&s;perate mea&s;ure.
They went &s;o far as to detain &s;everal lords in the Hou&s;e,
under pretence of &s;igning a prote&s;tation again&s;t rejecting
Fitz-harris's impeachment: But hearing that the Com|mons
had broke up in great con&s;ternation, they were
likewi&s;e obliged at la&s;t to &s;eparate. Shafte&s;bury's im|pri&s;onment
and trial put an end for &s;ome time to the&s;e
machinations; and it was not till the new &s;heriffs were im|po&s;ed
on the city that they were revived. The leaders of the
country party began then to apprehend them&s;elves in im|minent
danger; and they were well plea&s;ed to find, that the citizens were &s;truck with the &s;ame terror, and were
thence inclined to undertake the mo&s;t perilous enterprises.
Be&s;ides the city, applications were made to the gentry
and nobility in &s;everal counties of England to ri&s;e in
arms. Monmouth engaged the earl of Maccle&s;|field,
lord Brandon, Sir Gilbert Gerrard, and other
gentleman in Che&s;hire: Lord Ru&s;&s;el fixed a corre&s;pon|dence
<PB N="179" REF="223">
with Sir William Courtney, Sir Francis Rowles,
Sir Francis Drake, who promi&s;ed to rai&s;e the We&s;t;
and Trenchard in particular, who had great intere&s;t in
the di&s;affected town of Taunton, a&s;&s;ured him of con&s;i|derable
a&s;&s;i&s;tance from that neighbourhood. Shafte&s;bury
and his emi&s;&s;ary, Fergu&s;on, an independant clergyman
and a re&s;tle&s;s plotter, managed the corre&s;pondence in the
city, upon which the confederates chiefly relied. The
whole train was ready to take fire; but was prevented by
the caution of lord Ru&s;&s;el, who induced Monmouth to
delay the enterprise. Shafte&s;bury in the mean time was &s;o
affected with the &s;en&s;e of his danger, that he had left his
hou&s;e, and &s;ecretly lurked in the city; meditating all tho&s;e
de&s;perate &s;chemes, which di&s;appointed revenge and am|bition
could dictate. He exclaimed loudly again&s;t de|lay,
and repre&s;ented to his confederates, that having
gone &s;o far, and entru&s;ted the &s;ecret into &s;o many hands,
there was no &s;afety for them but in a bold and de&s;perate
pro&s;ecution of their purpo&s;e. The projects were there|fore
renewed: Meetings of the con&s;pirators were ap|pointed
in different hou&s;es, particulary in Shephard's an
eminent wine-merchant in the city: A plan of the in|&s;urrection
was laid in London, Che&s;hire, Devon&s;hire,
and Bri&s;tol: The &s;everal places of rendezvous in the
city were concerted: and the whole operations fixed:
The &s;tate of the guards was even viewed by Monmouth
and Arm&s;trong, and an attack on them pronounced very
practicable: A declaration to ju&s;tify the enterprise to the
public was read and agreed to: And every circum&s;tance
&s;eemed now to render an in&s;urrection unavoidable; when
a new delay was procured by Trenchard, who declared,
that the ri&s;ing in the We&s;t could not for &s;ome weeks be
in &s;ufficient forwardne&s;s.</P>
<P>SHAFTESBURY was enraged at the&s;e perpetual cautions
and delays in an enterprize, which, he thought, nothing
but courage and celerity could render effectual: He threat|ened
<PB N="180" REF="224">
to commence the in&s;urrection with his friends in
the city alone; and he boa&s;ted, that he had ten thou&s;and
<HI>bri&s;k boys,</HI> as he called them, who, on a motion of his
finger, were ready to fly to arms. Monmouth, Ru&s;&s;el,
and the other con&s;pirators, were, during &s;ome time, in
apprehen&s;ions, le&s;t de&s;pair &s;hould pu&s;h him into &s;ome
dangerous mea&s;ure; when they heard, that, after a long
&s;truggle between fear and rage, he had at la&s;t abandoned
all hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, and had retired into Holland. He
lived in a private manner at Am&s;terdam; and for greater
&s;ecurity de&s;ired to be admitted into the magi&s;tracy of that
city: But his former violent councils again&s;t the Dutch
commonwealth were remembered, and all applications
from him were rejected.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Shafte&s;bury retires and dies.</NOTE> He died &s;oon after; and his
end gave neither &s;orrow to his friends, nor joy to his ene|mies.
His &s;urious temper, notwith&s;tanding his capacity,
had done great injury to the cau&s;e, in which he was en|gaged.
The violences and iniquities, which he &s;ug|ge&s;ted
and encouraged, were greater than even faction
it&s;elf could endure; and men could not forbear &s;ome|times
remembering, that the &s;ame per&s;on, who was be|come
&s;o zealous a patriot, was once a mo&s;t pro&s;titute
courtier. It is remarkable, that this man, who&s;e prin|ciples
and conduct were, in all other re&s;pects, &s;o excep|tionable,
proved an excellent chancellor; and that all his
decrees, while he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that eminent office, were
equally remarkable for ju&s;tne&s;s and for integrity. So dif|ficult
it is to find in hi&s;tory a character either wholly bad
or perfectly good; tho' the prejudices of party make
writers run frequently into the extremes both of pane|gyric
and of &s;atire!</P>
<P>AFTER Shafte&s;bury's departure, the con&s;pirators found
&s;ome difficulty in renewing the corre&s;pondence with the
city malecontents, who had been accu&s;tomed to depend
&s;olely on that nobleman. Their common views, how|ever,
as well as common apprehen&s;ion, made them at
<PB N="181" REF="225">
la&s;t have recour&s;e to each other; and a regular project
of an in&s;urrection was again formed. A council of &s;ix
was erected, con&s;i&s;ting of Monmouth, Ru&s;&s;el, E&s;&s;ex,
Howard, Algernon Sidney, and John Hambden, grand|&s;on
to the great parliamentary leader. The&s;e men en|tered
into an agreement with Argyle and the Scots male-contents,
who engaged, that, upon the payment of
10,000 pounds for the purcha&s;e of arms in Holland, they
would bring the Covenanters into the field. In&s;urrections
likewi&s;e were anew projected in Che&s;hire and the We&s;t,
as well as in the city; and &s;ome meetings of the leaders
were held, in order to reduce the&s;e projects into form.
The con&s;pirators differed extremely in their views. Sid|ney
was pa&s;&s;ionate for a commonwealth. E&s;&s;ex had em|braced
the &s;ame project. But Monmouth had entertained
hopes of acquiring the Crown for him&s;elf. Ru&s;&s;el, as
well as Hambden, was much attached to the antient con|&s;titution,
and propo&s;ed only the exclu&s;ion of the Duke
and the redre&s;s of grievances, Lord Howard was a
man of abandoned principles, and was ready to embrace
any party, which his immediate intere&s;t &s;hould recom|mend
to him. But notwith&s;tanding this difference of
characters and of views, their common hatred of the
Duke and the pre&s;ent admini&s;tration united them into
one party; and the dangerous experiment of an in&s;ur|rection
was fully re&s;olved on.</P>
<P>WHILE the&s;e &s;chemes were concerting among the lea|ders,
there was an inferior order of con&s;pirators,
who frequently met together, and with the in&s;urrec|tion,
carried on projects quite unknown to Monmouth,
and the cabal of &s;ix.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rye-hou&s;e plot.</NOTE> Among the&s;e men were colonel

party-man; We&s;t, Tyley, Norton, Ayloffe, lawyers;
Fergu&s;on, Rou&s;e, Hone, Keiling, Holloway, Bourne,
Lee, Rumbald. Mo&s;t of the&s;e la&s;t were merchants or
trade&s;men; and the only per&s;ons of this confederacy,
who had acce&s;s to the leaders of the party, were Rum|&s;ey
and Fergu&s;on. When the&s;e men were met toge|ther
in their cabals, they indulged them&s;elves in the
mo&s;t de&s;perate and mo&s;t criminal di&s;cour&s;e: They frequently
mentioned the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination of the King and the Duke,
to which they had given the familiar appellation of <HI>lop|ping:</HI>
They even went &s;o far as to have thought of a
&s;cheme for that purpo&s;e. Rumbald, who was a mal|&s;ter,
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed a farm, called the Rye-hou&s;e, which lay
on the way to Newmarket, whither the King com|monly
went once a year, for the diversion of the races.
A plan of this farm had been laid before &s;ome of the
con&s;pirators by Rumbald, who &s;howed them how ea&s;y
it would be, by over-turning a cart, to &s;top at that place
the King's coach; while they might fire upon him from
the hedges, and be ea&s;ily enabled afterwards, thro' bye
lanes and cro&s;s the fields, to make their e&s;cape. But
tho' the plau&s;ibility of this &s;cheme gave great plea&s;ure to
the con&s;pirators, no concerted de&s;ign was as yet laid,
nor any men, hor&s;es, or arms provided: The whole was
little more than loo&s;e di&s;cour&s;e, the over-flowings of
their zeal and rancour. The hou&s;e in which the King
lived at Newmarket, took fire accidentally; and he was
obliged to leave that place eight days &s;ooner than he in|tended.
To this circum&s;tance his &s;afety was afterwards
a&s;cribed, when the con&s;piracy was di&s;covered; and the
court party could not &s;ufficiently admire the wi&s;e di&s;pen|&s;ations
of Providence. It is indeed certain, that as the
King had thus unexpectedly left Newmarket, he was
much wor&s;e attended than u&s;ual; and Rumbald informed
his confederates with regret what a fine opportunity was
thus unfortunately lo&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="183" REF="229">
AMONG the con&s;pirators I have mentioned Keiling, a
&s;alter in London. This man had been engaged in a
very bold mea&s;ure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Con&s;piracy di&s;covered.</NOTE> of arre&s;ting the mayor of London,
at the &s;uit of Papillon and Dubois, the outed &s;heriffs;
and being liable to pro&s;ecution for that action, he thought
it fafe&s;t to purcha&s;e a pardon, by revealing the con&s;piracy,
in which he was deeply concerned.<NOTE PLACE="marg">12th of June.</NOTE> He brought to &s;e|cretary
Jenkins intelligence of the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination plot;
but as he was a &s;ingle evidence, the &s;ecretary, whom
many fal&s;e plots had probably rendered incredulous, &s;cru|pled
to i&s;&s;ue warrants for the commitment of &s;o great a
number of per&s;ons. Keiling therefore, in order to for|tify
his te&s;timony, engaged his brother in trea&s;onable
di&s;cour&s;e with Good-enough, one of the con&s;pirators;
and Jenkins began now to give more attention to the in|telligence.
The con&s;pirators had got &s;ome hint of the
danger, in which they were involved; and all of them
concealed them&s;elves. One per&s;on alone, of the name
of Barber, an in&s;trument-maker, was &s;eized; and as his
confe&s;&s;ion concurred in many particulars with Keiling's
information, the affair &s;eemed to be put out of all que&s;|tion;
and a more diligent &s;earch was every where made
after the con&s;pirators.</P>
<P>WEST, the lawyer, and colonel Rum&s;ey, finding the
perils to which they were expo&s;ed in endeavouring to e&s;|cape,
re&s;olved to &s;ave their own lives at the expence of
their companions; and accordingly &s;urrendered them|&s;elves
with an intention of becoming evidence. We&s;t
could do little more than confirm, the te&s;timony of
Keiling with regard to the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination plot; but Rum|&s;ey,
be&s;ides additional confirmation of the &s;ame de&s;ign,
was at la&s;t, tho' with much difficulty, led to give an ac|count
of the meetings at Shephard's. Shephard was im|mediately
apprehended; and had not courage to maintain
fidelity to his confederates. Upon his information, or|ders
were i&s;&s;ued for arre&s;ting the great men engaged in
<PB N="184" REF="230">
the con&s;piracy. Monmouth ab&s;conded: Ru&s;&s;el was &s;ent
to the Tower; Gray was arre&s;ted but e&s;caped from the
me&s;&s;enger: Howard was taken, while he concealed him|&s;elf
in a chimney; and being a man of mo&s;t profligate
morals, as well as indigent circum&s;tances, he &s;crupled
not, in hopes of a pardon, to reveal the whole con&s;pi|racy.
E&s;&s;ex, Sidney, Hambden were immediately ap|prehended
upon his evidence. Every day &s;ome of the
con|&s;pirators were detected in their lurking-places, and
thrown into pri&s;on.</P>
<P>LIEUTENANT COLONEL WALCOT was fir&s;t brought
to his trial.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Execution of the con&s;pirators.</NOTE> This man, who was once noted for bra|very,
had been &s;o far overcome by the love of life, that
he had wrote to &s;ecretary Jenkins, and had offered upon
promi&s;e of pardon to turn evidence: But no &s;ooner had
he taken this mean &s;tep, than he felt more gene|rous
&s;entiments ari&s;e in him; and he endeavoured, tho'
in vain, to conceal him&s;elf. The witne&s;&s;es again&s;t him
were Rum&s;ey, We&s;t, Shephard, together with one
Bourne, a brewer. His own letter to the &s;ecretary was
produced, and rendered the te&s;timony of the witne&s;&s;es
unque&s;tionable. Hone and Rou&s;e were al&s;o condemned
to die. The&s;e two men, as well as Walcot, at their
execution, acknowleged the ju&s;tice of the &s;entence;
and from their trial and confe&s;&s;ion it is &s;ufficiently appa|rent,
that the plan of an in&s;urrection had been regularly
formed; and that even the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination had been often
talked of, and not without the approbation of many of
the con&s;pirators.</P>
<P>THE condemnation of the&s;e criminals was probably
intended as a preparative to the trial of lord Ru&s;&s;el,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of lord Ru&s;&s;el.</NOTE> and
&s;erved to impre&s;s the public with a thorow belief of the
con&s;piracy, as well as a horror again&s;t it. The witne&s;&s;es
produced again&s;t the noble pri&s;oner were Rum&s;ey, Shep|ard,
and lord Howard. Rum&s;ey &s;wore, that he him&s;elf
had been introduced to the cabal at Shephard's, where
<PB N="185" REF="231">
Ru&s;&s;el was pre&s;ent; and had delivered them a me&s;&s;age
from Shafte&s;bury, urging them to ha&s;ten the intended
in&s;urrection: But had received for an&s;wer, that it was
found ncce&s;&s;ary to delay the de&s;ign, and that Shafte&s;bury
mu&s;t therefore, for &s;ome time, re&s;t contented. This an|&s;wer,
he &s;aid, was delivered by Fergu&s;on, but was a&s;&s;ented
to by the pri&s;oner. He added, that &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e had
been entered into about taking a &s;urvey of the guards;
and he thought, that Monmouth, Gray and Arm&s;trong
undertook to view them. Shephard &s;wore, that his hou&s;e
had been beforehand be&s;poke by Fergu&s;on for the &s;e|cret
meeting of the con&s;pirators, and that he had been
careful to keep all his &s;ervants from approaching them,
and had &s;erved them him&s;elf. Their di&s;cour&s;e, he &s;aid,
ran chiefly upon the means of &s;urprizing the guards
and it was agreed that Monmouth and his two friends
&s;hould take a &s;urvey of them. The report, which they
brought next meeting, was, that the guards were remi&s;s,
and that the de&s;ign was very practicable: But he did not
affirm, that any re&s;olution was taken of executing it.
The pri&s;oner, he thought, was pre&s;ent at both the&s;e
meetings; but he was &s;ure, that at lea&s;t he was pre&s;ent
at one of them. A declaration, he added, had been
read by Fergu&s;on in Ru&s;&s;el's pre&s;ence: The rea&s;ons of
the intended in&s;urrection were there &s;et forth, and all
the public grievances fully di&s;played.</P>
<P>LORD HOWARD had been one of the cabal of &s;ix after
Shafte&s;bury's flight; and two meetings had been held of
the con&s;pirators, one at Hambden's, another at Ru&s;&s;el's.
Howard &s;wore, that, at the fir&s;t meeting, it was agreed
to begin the in&s;urrection in the country before the city;
the places were fixed, the proper quantity and kind of
arms agreed on, and the whole plan of operations con|certed:
That at the &s;econd meeting, the conver&s;ation
turned chiefly upon their corre&s;pondence with Argyle and
the di&s;contented Scots, and that the principal management
<PB N="186" REF="232">
of that affair was intru&s;ted to Sidney, who had &s;ent one
Aaron Smith into Scotland with proper in&s;tructions. He
added, that in the&s;e con&s;ults no que&s;tion was put nor
votes collected: but there was no contradiction, and,
as he took it, all of them, and the pri&s;oner among the
re&s;t, gave their con&s;ent.</P>
<P>RUMSEY and Shephard were very unwilling witne&s;&s;es
again&s;t lord Ru&s;&s;el; and it appears from Gray's Secret
Hi&s;tory<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">Page 43.</NOTE>, that, if they had plea&s;ed, they could have
given a more explicite te&s;timony again&s;t him. This re|luctance,
together with the difficulty of recollecting
circum&s;tances in a conver&s;ation, which had pa&s;&s;ed above
eight months before, and which the per&s;ons had not at
that time any intention to di&s;cover, may beget &s;ome
&s;light objection to their evidence. But on the whole, it
was undoubtedly proved, that the in&s;urrection had been
deliberated on by the pri&s;oner, and fully re&s;olved; the
&s;urpri&s;al of the guards deliberated on, but not fully re|&s;olved;
and that an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination had never once been
mentioned or imagined by him. So far the matter of
fact &s;eems certain: But &s;till, with regard to law, there
remained a difficulty, and that of a very important
nature.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h laws of trea&s;on, both in the manner of
defining that crime and in the proof required, are the
milde&s;t and mo&s;t indulgent, and con&s;equently the
mo&s;t equitable, that are any where to be found.
The two chief &s;pecies of trea&s;on, contained in the
law of Edward the third, are the compa&s;&s;ing and
intending the King's death, and the actual levying
war again&s;t him; and by the law of Mary the
crime mu&s;t be proved by the concurring te&s;timony of
two witne&s;&s;es, to &s;ome overt act, tending to the&s;e pur|po&s;es.
But the lawyers, partly de&s;irous of paying court
to the Sovereign, partly convinced of ill con&s;equences,
<PB N="187" REF="233">
which might attend &s;uch narrow limitations, had intro|duced
a greater latitude, both in the proof and definition
of the crime. It was not required, that the two wit|ne&s;&s;es
&s;hould te&s;tify the &s;ame preci&s;e overt act: It was
&s;ufficient, that they both te&s;tified &s;ome overt act of the
&s;ame trea&s;on; and tho' this eva&s;ion may &s;eem a &s;ubtilty,
it had long prevailed in the courts of judicature, and had
at la&s;t been &s;olemnly fixed by parliament at the trial of
lord Stafford. The lawyers had u&s;ed the &s;ame freedom,
tho' perhaps after a more exceptionable manner, with the
law of Edward the third. They had ob&s;erved, that, by that
famous &s;tatute, if a man &s;hould enter into a con&s;piracy
for a rebellion, &s;hould even fix a corre&s;pondence with fo|reign
powers for that purpo&s;e, &s;hould provide arms and
money, yet, if he was detected and no rebellion en&s;ued,
he could not be tried for trea&s;on. To prevent this in|convenience,
which it had been better to remedy by a
new law, they had commonly laid their indictment for
intending the death of the King, and had produced the
intention of a rebellion as a proof of that other inten|tion.
But tho' this form of indictment and trial
was very frequent, and many criminals had received
&s;entence upon it, it was con&s;idered as irregular, and was
plainly confounding, by a &s;ophi&s;m, two &s;pecies of trea|&s;on,
which the &s;tatute had mo&s;t accurately di&s;tingui&s;hed.
What made this refinement &s;till more inexcu&s;able; a
law had pa&s;&s;ed &s;oon after the re&s;toration, where the con|&s;ulting
or intending a rebellion, was, during Charles's
life-time, declared trea&s;on; and it was required that the
pro&s;ecution &s;hould be made within &s;ix months after the
crime was committed. But notwith&s;tanding this &s;ta|tute,
the lawyers had per&s;evered, as they &s;till do per&s;e|vere,
in the old form of indictment; and both Sir Harry
Vane and Oliver Plunket, titular primate of Ireland, had
been tried by it. Such was the general horror, entertained
again&s;t the old republicans, and the popi&s;h con&s;pirators,
<PB N="188" REF="234">
that no-one had murmured again&s;t this interpretation of
the &s;tatute; and the lawyers thought, that they might
follow the precedent even in the ca&s;e of the popular and
beloved lord Ru&s;&s;el. Ru&s;&s;el's crime fell plainly under
the &s;tatute of Charles the 2d; but the facts &s;worne to by
Rum&s;ey and Shepard were without the &s;ix months re|quired
by law and to thc other facts Howard was a
&s;ingle witne&s;s. To make the indictment, therefore,
more exten&s;ive, the intention of murdering the King
was comprehended in it; and for proof of this intention
the con&s;piracy for rai&s;ing a rebellion was a&s;&s;igned; and
what &s;eemed to bring the matter &s;till nearer, the de&s;ign
of attacking the King's guards.</P>
<P>RUSSEL perceived this irregularity, and de&s;ired to have
the point-argued by council: The chief ju&s;tice told him,
that that privilege could not be granted, unle&s;s he previ|ou&s;ly
confe&s;&s;ed the facts charged upon him. The arti|ficial
confounding the two &s;pecies of trea&s;on, tho' a prac|tice
&s;upported by many precedents, is the chief, but not
the only hard&s;hip, of which Ru&s;&s;el had rea&s;on to complain
on his trial. His defence was very feeble; and he con|tented
him&s;elf with prote&s;ting, that he never had enter|tained
any de&s;ign again&s;t the King's life: His candour
would not allow him to deny the con&s;piracy for an in|&s;urrection.
The jury were men of fair and irreproach|able
characters, but zealous Royali&s;ts: After a &s;hort de|liberation,
they brought in the pri&s;oner guilty.</P>
<P>APPLICATIONS were made to the King for a pardon:
Even money, to the amount of an hundred thou&s;and
pounds, was offered to the dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth by
the old earl of Bedford, father to Ru&s;&s;el. The King
was inexorable. He had been extremely harra&s;&s;ed with
the violence of the country party, and he had ob&s;erved,
that the pri&s;oner, be&s;ides his &s;ecret de&s;igns, had always
been carried to the highe&s;t extremity of oppo&s;ition in
Parliament. He had even adopted a &s;entiment, &s;imilar to
<PB N="189" REF="235">
what we meet with in a letter of the younger Brutus.
Had his father, he &s;aid, advi&s;ed the King to reject the
exclu&s;ion-bill, he would he the fir&s;t to move for a parlia|mentary
impeachment again&s;t him. When &s;uch determined
re&s;olution was ob&s;erved, his popularity, his humanity,
his ju&s;tice, his very virtues became &s;o many crimes,
and were u&s;ed as arguments again&s;t &s;paring him. Charles
therefore would go no farther than remit the more ig|nominious
part of the &s;entence, which the law requires
to be pronounced again&s;t traitors. &startq;My lord Ru&s;&s;el,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;&s;hall find, that I am po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that prero|gative,
which, in the ca&s;e of lord Stafford, he thought
fit to deny me.&endq; As the fury of the country party
had rendered it impo&s;&s;ible for the King, without the mo&s;t
imminent danger of his throne, to pardon &s;o many Ca|tholics,
whom he firmly believed to be innocent, and
even affectionate and loyal to him; he probably thought,
that, &s;ince the edge of the law was now ready to fall up|on
that party them&s;elves, they could not rea&s;onably ex|pect,
that he would interpo&s;e to &s;ave them.</P>
<P>RUSSEL'S con&s;ort, a woman of great merit, daughter
and heire&s;s of the good earl of Southampton, threw
her&s;elf at the King's feet, and pleaded with many tears
the merits and loyalty of her father, as an atonement
for tho&s;e errors, into which hone&s;t, however mi&s;taken
principles had &s;educed her hu&s;band. The&s;e &s;upplications
were the la&s;t in&s;tance of female weakne&s;s (if they de&s;erve
the name) which &s;he betrayed Finding all applications
vain, &s;he collected courage, and not only fortified her&s;elf
again&s;t the fatal blow, but endeavoured by her ex|ample
to &s;trengthen the re&s;olution of her unfortunate
lord. With a tender and decent compo&s;ure they took
have of each other on the day of his execution. &startq;The
bitterne&s;s of death is now pa&s;&s;ed,&endq; &s;aid he, when he
turned from her. Lord Cavendi&s;h had lived in the clo&s;e&s;t
intimacy with Ru&s;&s;el, and de&s;erted not his friend
<PB N="190" REF="236">
in the pre&s;ent calamity. He gallantly offered to manage
his e&s;cape, by changing cloaths with him, and remain|ing
at all hazards in his place. Ru&s;&s;el refu&s;ed to &s;ave his
own life, by an expedient which might expo&s;e his friend
to &s;o many hard&s;hips. When the duke of Monmouth
by me&s;&s;age offered to &s;urrender him&s;elf, if Ru&s;&s;el thought
that that mea&s;ure would any way contribute to his &s;afety;
&startq;It will be no advantage to me,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;to have my

done,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;with time, and henceforth mu&s;t
think &s;olely of eternity.&endq;</P>
<P>THE &s;caffold was erected in Lincoln's Inn Fields,<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t of July.</NOTE> a
place very di&s;tant from the Tower; and it was probably
intended, by conducting Ru&s;&s;el thro' &s;o many &s;treets,
to &s;how the mutinous city their beloved leader, once the
object of all their confidence, now expo&s;ed to the utmo&s;t
rigours of the law. As he was the mo&s;t popular among
his own party; &s;o was he ever the lea&s;t obnoxious to the
oppo&s;ite faction:<NOTE PLACE="marg">and execu|tion.</NOTE> And his melancholy fate united every
heart, &s;en&s;ible of humanity, in a tender compa&s;&s;ion for
him. Without the lea&s;t change of countenance, he laid
his head on the block; and at two &s;trokes, it was &s;e|vered
from his body.</P>
<P>IN the &s;peech, which he delivered to the &s;heriffs, he
was very anxious to clear his memory from any imputa|tion
of ever intending the King's death, or any altera|tion
in the government: He could not explicitely con|fe&s;s
the projected in&s;urrection without hurting his friends,
who might &s;till be called in que&s;tion for it; but he did
<PB N="191" REF="237">
not purge him&s;elf of that de&s;ign, which, in the pre&s;ent
condition of the nation, he regarded as no crime. By
many pa&s;&s;ages in his &s;peech, he &s;eems to the la&s;t to have
lain under the influence of party zeal; a pa&s;&s;ion, which
being nouri&s;hed by a &s;ocial temper, and cloathing it&s;elf
under the appearance of principle, it is almo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible
for a virtuous man, who has acted in public life, ever
thoroughly to eradicate. He profe&s;&s;ed his entire belief in
the popi&s;h plot: And he &s;aid, that, tho' he had often
heard the &s;eizure of the guards mentioned, he had ever
di&s;approved of that attempt. To which he added,
that the ma&s;&s;acring &s;o many innocent men in cold blood
was &s;o like a popi&s;h practice, that he could not but ab|hor
it. Upon the whole, the integrity and virtuous inten|tions,
rather than the capacity, of this unfortunate noble|man,
&s;eem to have been the &s;hining parts of his character.</P>
<P>ALGERNON SIDNEY was next brought to his trial.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Trial of Algernon Sidney.</NOTE>
This gallant per&s;on, &s;on to the earl of Leice&s;ter, had
entered deeply into the war again&s;t the late King; and tho'
no way tainted with enthu&s;ia&s;m, he had &s;o far &s;hared in
all the councils of the independant republican party, as
to have been named on the high court of ju&s;tice, which
tried and condemned that Monarch: He thought not
proper, however, to take his &s;eat among the judges. He
ever oppo&s;ed Cromwel's u&s;urpation with zeal and cou|rage;
and after employing all his efforts again&s;t the re|&s;toration,
he re&s;olved to take no benefit of the general
indemnity, but cho&s;e voluntary buni&s;hment, rather than
&s;ubmit to a government and family, which he abhorred.
As long as the republican party had any exi&s;tence, he
was active in every &s;cheme, however unpromi&s;ing, which
tended to promote their cau&s;e: But at la&s;t, in 1677,
finding it nece&s;&s;ary for his private affairs to return into
England, he had applied for the King's pardon, and had
obtained it. When the factions, ari&s;ing from the po|pi&s;h
plot, began to run high, Sidney, full of tho&s;e ideas

of liberty, which he had imbibed from the great examples
antiquity, joined the popular party; and was
even willing to &s;eek a &s;econd time, thro' all the horrors of civil war, for his adored republic.</P>
<P>FROM this imperfect &s;ketch of the character and con|duct
of this illu&s;trious per&s;onage, it may ea&s;ily be con|ceived
how obnoxious he was become to the court and
mini&s;try: What alone renders them inexcu&s;able was the
illegal method, which they took, of effecting their pur|po&s;e
again&s;t him. On Sidney's trial they produced a
great number of witne&s;&s;es, who proved the reality of a plot
in general; and when the pri&s;oner exclaimed, that
all the&s;e evidences &s;aid nothing of him, he was an&s;wer|ed,
that this method of proceeding, however irregular,
had been practi&s;ed in the pro&s;ecutions of the popi&s;h con|&s;pirators:
A topic more fit to condemn one party than to
ju&s;tify the other. The only witne&s;s, who depo&s;ed
again&s;t Sidney was lord Howard; but as the law require|ed
two witne&s;&s;es, a &s;trange expedient was fallen on to
&s;upply this deficiency. In ran&s;acking the pri&s;oner's clo&s;et;
&s;ome di&s;cour&s;es on government were found; where he
had maintained principles, favourable indeed to liberty,
but &s;uch as the be&s;t and mo&s;t dutiful &s;ubjects in all ages
have been known to embrace; the original contract,
the &s;ource of power from a con&s;ent of the people, the
lawfulne&s;s of re&s;i&s;ting tyrants, the preference of liberty
to the government of a &s;ingle per&s;on. The&s;e papers
were a&s;&s;erted to be equivalent to a &s;econd witne&s;s, and
even to many witne&s;&s;es. The pri&s;oner replied, that
there was no other rea&s;on for a&s;cribing the&s;e papers to
him be&s;ides a &s;imilitude of hand; a proof, which was
never admitted in criminal pro&s;ecutions: That allowing
him to be the author, he had compo&s;ed them &s;olely for
his private amu&s;ement, and had never publi&s;hed them to
the world, or even communicated them to any &s;ingle
per&s;on: That, when examined, they appeared by the
<PB N="193" REF="241">
colour of the ink to have been wrote many years before,
and were in vain produced as evidences of a pre&s;ent con|&s;piracy
again&s;t the government: And that where the law
po&s;itively requires two witne&s;&s;es, one witne&s;s, attended
with the mo&s;t convincing circum&s;tances, could never
&s;uffice; much le&s;s, when &s;upported by a circum&s;tance
&s;o weak and precarious. All the&s;e arguments, tho' urged
by the pri&s;oner with great courage and pregnancy of
rea&s;on, had no influence. The violent and inhuman
Jefferies was now chief ju&s;tice; and by his direction a
partial jury was ea&s;ily prevailed on to give a verdict
again&s;t Sidney. His execution followed a few days after|wards:
He complained, and with rea&s;on, of the iniquity
of the &s;entence; but he had too much greatne&s;s of mind
to deny tho&s;e con&s;ults with Monmouth and Ru&s;&s;el,<NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of De|cember. His execution.</NOTE> in
which he had been engaged. He rather gloried, that he
now &s;uffered for that <HI>good old cau&s;e,</HI> in which, from his
earlie&s;t youth, he &s;aid, he had inli&s;ted him&s;elf.</P>
<P>THE execution of Sidney is regarded as one of the
greate&s;t blemi&s;hes of the pre&s;ent reign. The evidence
again&s;t him, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed was not legal; and
the jury, who condemned him, were, for that rea|&s;on,
very blameable. But that after &s;entence pa&s;&s;ed by
a court of judicature, the King &s;hould interpo&s;e and par|don
a man, who, tho' otherwi&s;e po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of great me|rit,
was undoubtedly guilty, who had ever been a mo&s;t
inflexible and mo&s;t inveterate enemy to the royal family,
and who lately had even abu&s;ed the King's clemency,
might be an act of heroic genero&s;ity, but can never be
regarded as a nece&s;&s;ary and indi&s;pen&s;ible duty.</P>
<P>HOWARD was al&s;o the &s;ole evidence again&s;t Hamb|den;
and his te&s;timony was not &s;upported by any very
material circum&s;tance. The crown-lawyers therefore
found it in vain to try the pri&s;oner for trea&s;on:
They laid the indictment only for mi&s;demeanours, and
obtained &s;entence again&s;t him. The fine impo&s;ed was
exorbitant; no le&s;s than forty thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P><PB N="194" REF="242">
HOLLOWAY, a merchant of Bri&s;tol, one of the con|&s;pirators,
had fled to the We&s;t Indies, and was now
brought over. He had been out-lawed; but the year,
allowed him for pre&s;enting him&s;elf, was not expired. A
trial was therefore offered him: But as he had at fir&s;t
confe&s;&s;ed his being engaged in a con&s;piracy for an in&s;ur|rection,
and even allowed that he had heard &s;ome di&s;|cour&s;es
of an a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination, tho' he had not approved of
them, he thought it more expedient to throw him&s;elf on
the King's mercy. He was executed, per&s;i&s;ting in the
&s;ame confe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>SIR THOMAS ARMSTRONG, who had been &s;eized in
Holland by Chidley, the King's mini&s;ter, and &s;ent over,
was preci&s;ely in the &s;ame &s;ituation with Holloway: But
the &s;ame favour, or rather ju&s;tice, was refu&s;ed him.
The lawyers pretended, that, unle&s;s he voluntarily came
in before the expiration of the time a&s;&s;igned, he could
not claim the privilege of a trial; not con&s;idering, that
the &s;eizure of his per&s;on ought in equity to be &s;uppo&s;ed
the accident which prevented him. The King bore a
great enmity again&s;t this gentleman, by whom he be|lieved
the duke of Monmouth to have been &s;educed
from his duty: He al&s;o a&s;&s;erted, that Armstrong had once
promi&s;ed Cromwel to a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inate him; tho' it mu&s;t be
confe&s;&s;ed, that the pri&s;oner ju&s;tified him&s;elf from this
imputation by very &s;trong arguments. The&s;e were the
rea&s;ons of that inju&s;tice, which was now done him. It
was apprehended, that &s;ufficient evidence of his guilt
could not be produced; and that even the partial juries,
which were now returned, and which allowed them&s;elves
to be entirely directed by Jefferies and other violent
judges, would not give &s;entence again&s;t him.</P>
<P>ON the day that Ru&s;&s;el was tried, E&s;&s;ex, a man emi|nent
both for virtues and abilities, was found in the
Tower with his throat cut. The coroner's inque&s;t
brought in their verdict, <HI>&s;elf-murther:</HI> Vet becau&s;e two
children of ten years of age (one of whom too departed
<PB N="195" REF="243">
from his evidence) had affirmed, that they heard a great
noi&s;e from his window, and that they &s;aw a hand throw
out a bloody razor, the&s;e circum&s;tances were laid hold
of, and the murder was a&s;cribed to the King and the
Duke, who happened that morning to pay a vi&s;it to the
Tower. E&s;&s;ex was &s;ubject to fits of deep melancholy,
and had been &s;eized with one immediately upon his com|mitment:
He was accu&s;tomed to maintain the lawful|ne&s;s
of &s;uicide: And his counte&s;s, upon a &s;trict enquiry,
which was committed to the care of Dr. Burnet, found
no rea&s;on to confirm the &s;u&s;picion: Yet could not all
the&s;e circum&s;tances, joined to many others, entirely re|move
the imputation. It is no wonder, that faction is
&s;o productive of vices of all kinds: For, be&s;ides that it
inflames all the pa&s;&s;ions, it tends much to remove tho&s;e
great re&s;traints, honour and &s;hame; when men find,
that no iniquity can lo&s;e them the applau&s;e of their own
party, and no innocence &s;ecure them again&s;t the calum|nies
of the oppo&s;ite.</P>
<P>BUT tho' there is no rea&s;on to think, that E&s;&s;ex had
been murdered by any orders from court, it mu&s;t be ac|knowleged,
that a very unju&s;tifiable u&s;e in Ru&s;&s;el's trial
was made of that incident. The King's council men|tioned
it in their pleadings as a &s;trong proof of the con|&s;piracy;
and it is &s;aid to have had great weight with the
jury. It was in&s;i&s;ted on in Sidney's trial for the &s;ame
purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>SOME memorable cau&s;es,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of the nation.</NOTE> tried about this time, tho'
they have no relation to the Rye-hou&s;e con&s;piracy, &s;how
the temper of the bench and the juries. Oates was con|victed
of having called the Duke a popi&s;h traitor; was
fined to the amount of one hundred thou&s;and pounds; and
was condemned to pri&s;on till he &s;hould make payment.
A like illegal &s;entence was pa&s;&s;ed upon Dutton-Colt for
a like offence. Sir Samuel Barnardi&s;ton was fined ten
thou&s;and pounds; becau&s;e, in &s;ome private letters, which
<PB N="196" REF="244">
had been intercepted, he had reflected on the govern|ment.
This gentleman was obnoxious, becau&s;e he had
been foreman of that jury, which rejected the bill again&s;t
Shafte&s;bury. A pretence was therefore fallen upon for
puni&s;hing him; tho' &s;uch a precedent may ju&s;tly be
e&s;teemed a very unu&s;ual act of &s;everity, and &s;ufficient to
de&s;troy all confidence in private friend&s;hip and corre|spondence.</P>
<P>THERE is another remarkable trial, which &s;hows the
di&s;po&s;ition of the courts of judicature, and which, tho'
it pa&s;&s;ed in the en&s;uing year, it may not be improper to
relate here. One Ro&s;ewel, a pre&s;byterian preacher, was
accu&s;ed by three women of having &s;poke trea&s;onable
words in a &s;ermon. They &s;wore to two or three peri|ods,
and agreed &s;o exactly together, that there was not
the &s;malle&s;t variation in their depositions. Ro&s;ewel on
the other hand made a very good defence. He proved,
that the witne&s;&s;es were lewd and infamous per&s;ons. He
proved, that, even during Cromwel's u&s;urpation, he
had always been loyal; that he prayed con&s;tantly for the
King in his family; and that in his &s;ermons he
often inculcated the obligations of loyalty. And as to
the &s;ermon, of which he was accu&s;ed, &s;everal witne&s;&s;es,
who heard it, and &s;ome who wrote it in &s;hort hand, de|po&s;ed that he had u&s;ed no &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions as tho&s;e ob|jected
to him. He offered his own notes as a farther
proof. The women could not &s;hew by any circum|&s;tance
or witne&s;&s;es, that they were at his meeting. And
the expre&s;&s;ions, which they &s;wore again&s;t him, were &s;o
gro&s;&s;&punc; that no man in his &s;en&s;es could be &s;uppo&s;ed to
employ them before a mixt audience. It was al&s;o urged,
that it was next to impo&s;&s;ible for three women to re|member
&s;o long a period upon one &s;ingle hearing, and
to remember it &s;o exactly, as to agree to a tittle in their
depo&s;itions with regard to it. The pri&s;oner offered to
put the whole upon this i&s;&s;ue: He would pronounce,
<PB N="197" REF="245">
with his u&s;ual tone of voice, a period as long as that
which they had &s;worn to; and then let them try to re|peat
it, if they could. What was more unaccountable,
they had forgot even the text of his &s;ermon; nor did
they remember any &s;ingle pa&s;&s;age, but the words, which
they depo&s;ed to. After &s;o &s;trong a defence, the &s;ollici|tor
general thought not proper to make any reply: Even
Jefferies went no farther than &s;ome general declamations
again&s;t conventicles and Pre&s;byterians: Yet &s;o violent
were party-prejudices, that the jury gave a verdict again&s;t
the pri&s;oner; which however appeared &s;o palpably un|ju&s;t,
that it never was executed.</P>
<P>THE duke of Monmouth had ab&s;conded on the fir&s;t
di&s;covery of the con&s;piracy; and the Court could get no
intelligence of him. At la&s;t, Hallifax, who began to
apprehend the too great prevalence of the royal party, and
who thought, that Monmouth's intere&s;t would prove the
be&s;t counterballance to the Duke's, di&s;covered his retreat,
and prevailed with him to write two letters to the King,
full of the tendere&s;t and mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive expre&s;&s;ions.
The King's fondne&s;s was revived; and he permitted
Monmouth to come to court. He even endeavoured to
mediate a reconciliation between his &s;on and his brother;
and having promi&s;ed Monmouth, that his te&s;timony
&s;hould never be employed again&s;t any of his &s;pends, he
engaged him to give a full account of the plot. But, in
order to put the country party to &s;ilence, he called next
day an extraordinary council; and informed them, that
Monmouth had &s;howed great penitence for the &s;hare,
which he had had in the late con&s;piracy, and had ex|pre&s;&s;ed
his re&s;olutions never more to engage in &s;uch cri|minal
enterprizes. He went &s;o far as to give orders, that
a paragraph to the like purpo&s;e &s;hould be in&s;erted in the
Gazette. Monmouth kept &s;ilence 'till he had obtained
his pardon in form: But finding, that, by taking this
&s;tep, he was entirely di&s;graced with his party, and that,
<PB N="198" REF="246">
even tho' he &s;hould not be produced in court as an evi|dence,
his te&s;timony, being &s;o publickly known, might
have weight with juries on any future trial, he re&s;olved
at all hazards to retrieve his honour. His emi&s;&s;aries,
therefore, received orders to deny, that he had ever made
any &s;uch confe&s;&s;ion as that a&s;cribed to him; and the party
cried aloud, that the whole was a fiction of the Court.
The King, provoked at this conduct, bani&s;hed Mon|mouth
his pre&s;ence, and afterwards ordered him to de|part
the kingdom.</P>
<P>THE court were well aware, that the malecontents in
England had held a corre&s;pondence with tho&s;e in Scot|land;
and that Baillic of Jervi&s;wood, a man of merit
and learning, with two gentlemen of the name of Camp|bel,
had come to London, under pretence of negociating
the &s;ettlement of the Scots Pre&s;byterians in Carolina,
but really with a view to concert mea&s;ures with the Eng|li&s;h
con&s;pirators. Baillie was &s;ent pri&s;oner to Edin|burgh;
and as no evidence appeared again&s;t him, the
council required him to &s;wear, that he would an&s;wer all
que&s;tions, which &s;hould be propounded to him. Baillie
refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to &s;o iniquitious a condition; and a
fine of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds was impo&s;ed upon him. At
la&s;t, two per&s;ons, Spence and Car&s;tares, being put to
the torture, gave evidence which involved the earl of
Tarras and &s;ome others, who, in order to &s;ave them|&s;elves
from attainder, were reduced to accu&s;e Baillie.
He was brought to trial; and being in &s;o langui&s;hing a
condition from the cruel treatment, which he had met
with in pri&s;on, that it was feared he would not &s;urvive
that night, he was ordered to be executed the very af|ternoon,
on which he received &s;entence.</P>
<P>THE &s;everities, exerci&s;ed during this part of the pre|&s;ent
reign, were much contrary to the u&s;ual tenor of the
King's conduct; and tho' tho&s;e who &s;tudied his cha|racter
more narrowly, have pronounced, that towards
<PB N="199" REF="247">
great offences he was rigid and inexorable, the nation
were more inclined to a&s;cribe every unju&s;t or hard mea|&s;ure
to the prevalence of the Duke's councils, into who&s;e
hands the King had, from indolence, not from any opi|nion
of his brother's &s;uperior capacity, re&s;igned the reins
of government. The Crown indeed gained great advan|tages
from the detection of the con&s;piracy, and lo&s;t none
by the rigorous execution of the con&s;pirators: The hor|ror
entertained again&s;t the a&s;&s;a&s;&s;ination-plot, which was
commonly confounded with the de&s;ign of an in&s;urrec|tion,
rendered the whole party unpopular, and recon|ciled
the nation to the mea&s;ures of the court. The
mo&s;t loyal addre&s;&s;es came from all parts of the kingdom;
and the doctrine of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to the civil magi&s;trates,
and even of an unlimited pa&s;&s;ive obedience, became the
reigning principle of the times. The univer&s;ity of Ox|ford
pa&s;&s;ed a &s;olemn decree, condemning &s;ome doctrines,
which they denominated republican, but which indeed
are, mo&s;t of them, the only tenets, on which liberty
and a limited constitution can be founded. The faction
of the exclusioni&s;ts, lately &s;o numerous, powerful, and
zealous, were at the King's feet; and were as much
fallen in their &s;pirit as in their credit with the nation.
Nothing, which had the lea&s;t appearance of oppo&s;ition
to the Court, could be hearkened to by the public.</P>
<P>THE King endeavoured to encrea&s;e his pre&s;ent popu|larity
by every art;<NOTE PLACE="marg">163$.</NOTE> and knowing, that the &s;u&s;picion of
popery was of all others the mo&s;t dangerous, he judged
it proper to marry his niece, the Lady Anne, to Prince
George, brother to the King of Denmark. All the
credit, however, and per&s;ua&s;ion of Hallifax, could not
engage him to call a Parliament, or tru&s;t the nation with
the election of a new repre&s;entative. Tho' his revenues
were extremely burthened, he cho&s;e rather to &s;truggle
with the pre&s;ent difficulties, than try an experiment,
<PB N="200" REF="248">
which, by rai&s;ing afre&s;h &s;o many di&s;contented humours,
might prove dangerous to his repo&s;e. The Duke like|wi&s;e
zealou&s;ly ob&s;tructed this propo&s;al, and even en|gaged
the King in mea&s;ures, which could have no other
tendency, than to render any accommodation with a Par|liament
altogether impracticable. Williams, who had
been &s;peaker during the two la&s;t Parliaments, was pro|&s;ecuted
for warrants, i&s;&s;ued by him, in obedience to or|ders
of the Hou&s;e: A breach of privilege, which it
&s;eemed not likely, any future Hou&s;e of Commons would
leave unpuni&s;hed. Danby and the popi&s;h lords, who
had &s;o long been, confined to the Tower, and who &s;aw
no pro&s;pect of a trial in Parliament, were admitted to
bail: A mea&s;ure very ju&s;t in it&s;elf, but deemed a great en|croachment
on the privileges of that a&s;&s;embly. The
Duke contrary to law, was re&s;tored to the office of
high admiral, without taking the te&s;t.</P>
<P>HAD the lea&s;t grain of jealou&s;y or emulation been
mixed in the King's character; had he been actuated by
that concern, for his people's or even for his own ho|nour,
which his high &s;tation demanded, he would have
hazarded many dome&s;tic inconveniencies rather than
allow: France to domineer in &s;o haughty a manner as
that which at pre&s;ent &s;he a&s;&s;umed in every negotiation.<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of foreign affairs.</NOTE> The peace of Nimeguen, impo&s;ed by the Dutch on their
unwilling allies, had disjointed the whole confederacy;
and all the powers, engaged in it, had di&s;banded their
&s;upernumerary troops, which they found &s;uch difficulty
to &s;ub&s;i&s;t. Lewis alone &s;till maintained a very powerful
army, and by his preparations rendered him&s;elf every day
more formidable. He now acted as if he were the &s;ole
Sovereign in Europe, and as if all other Princes were
&s;oon to become his va&s;&s;als. Courts or chambers were
erected in Metz and Bri&s;ac, for re-uniting &s;uch territo|ries
as had ever been members of any part of his new
conque&s;ts. They made inquiry into titles buried in the
<PB N="201" REF="249">
mo&s;t remote antiquity. They cited the neighbouring
Princes to appear before them, and i&s;&s;ued decrees, ex|pelling
them from the contested territories. The im|portant
town of Stra&s;bourg, an antient and a free &s;tate,
was &s;eized by Lewis: Alo&s;t was demanded of the Spa|niards,
on a mo&s;t frivolous, and even ridiculous pre|tence;
and upon their refu&s;al to yield it, Luxembourg
was blockaded, and &s;oon after taken. Genoa had been
bombarded, becau&s;e the Genoe&s;e had &s;tipulated to build
&s;ome gallies for the Spaniards; and in order to avoid a
more &s;evere fate, that republic was obliged to yield to
the mo&s;t mortifying conditions. The empire was in|&s;ulted
in its head and principal members; and u&s;ed no
other expedient for redre&s;s, but impotent complaints and
remon&s;trances.</P>
<P>SPAIN was &s;o enraged at the in&s;olent treatment which
&s;he met with, that, without-con&s;idering her pre&s;ent weak
condition, &s;he declared war again&s;t her haughty enemy:
She hoped, that the other powers of Europe, &s;en&s;ible of
the common danger, would fly to her a&s;&s;i&s;tance. The
prince of Orange, who&s;e ruling pa&s;&s;ions were the love of
war and animo&s;ity again&s;t France, &s;econded every where
the applications of the Spaniards. In the year 1681, he
even made a journey to England, in order to engage the
King into clo&s;er mea&s;ures with the confederates. He
al&s;o propo&s;ed to the States to make an augmentation of
their forces; but &s;everal of the provinces, and even the
town of Am&s;terdam, had been gained by the French,
and the propo&s;al was rejected. The Prince's enemies
derived the mo&s;t plau&s;ible rea&s;ons of their oppo&s;ition from
the &s;ituation of England, and the known and avowed at|tachments
of the Engli&s;h Monarch.</P>
<P>No &s;ooner had Charles di&s;mi&s;&s;ed his Parliaments, and
embraced the re&s;olution of governing by prerogative
alone, than he dropped his new alliance with Spain, and
returned to his former dangerous connexions with Lewis.
<PB N="202" REF="250">
That Prince had even offered to make him arbiter of his
differences with Spain; and this latter power, &s;en&s;ible
of Charles's partiality, had refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a
di&s;advantageous propo&s;al. Whether any money was
now remitted to England, we do not certainly know:
But we may fairly pre&s;ume, that the King's nece&s;&s;ities
were in &s;ome degree relieved by France. And tho'
Charles had rea&s;on to apprehend the utmo&s;t danger from
the great, and &s;till encrea&s;ing, naval power of that king|dom,
joined to the weak condition of the Engli&s;h fleet,
no con&s;ideration was able to rouze him from his pre&s;ent
lethargy.</P>
<P>IT is here we are to fix the point of the highe&s;t ex|altation,
which the power of Lewis or that of any Eu|ropean
Prince, &s;ince the age of Charlemagne, had ever
attained. The only Monarch, capable of oppo&s;ing his
progre&s;s, was entirely engaged in his intere&s;ts; and the
Turks, invited by the malecontents of Hungary, were
preparing to invade the Emperor, and to di&s;able that
Prince from making head again&s;t the progre&s;s of the
French power. Lewis may even be accu&s;ed of over&s;ight,
in not making &s;ufficient advantage of &s;uch favourable op|portunities,
which he was never afterwards able to re|call.
But that Monarch, tho' more governed by mo|tives
of ambition than by tho&s;e of ju&s;tice or moderation,
was &s;till more actuated by the &s;ugge&s;tions of vanity.
He contented him&s;elf with in&s;ulting and domineering
over all the Princes and free States of Europe; and he
thereby provoked their re&s;entment, without &s;ubduing
their power. While every one, who approached his
per&s;on, and behaved with &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to his authority,
was treated with the highe&s;t politene&s;s; all the neigh|bouring
Potentates had &s;ucce&s;&s;ively felt the effects of his
haughty imperious di&s;po&s;ition. And by indulging his
poets, orators, and courtiers in their flatteries, and in
their progno&s;tications of univer&s;al empire, he conveyed
<PB N="203" REF="251">
fa&s;ter, than by the pro&s;pect of his power alone, the ap|prehen&s;ion
of general conque&s;t and &s;ubjection.</P>
<P>THE French greatne&s;s never,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1685.</NOTE> during his whole reign,
in&s;pired Charles with any apprehen&s;ions; and Clifford,
'tis &s;aid, one of his mo&s;t favoured ministers, went &s;o far
as to affirm, that it were better for the King to be Vice|roy
under a great and generous Monarch, than a &s;lave to
five hundred of his own in&s;olent &s;ubjects. The ambi|tion
therefore and uncontrouled power of Lewis were
no diminution of Charles's happine&s;s; and in other re|&s;pects
his condition &s;eemed at pre&s;ent more eligible than
it had ever been &s;ince his re&s;toration. A mighty faction,
which had &s;hook his throne, and menaced his family,
was totally &s;ubdued, and by their precipitant indi&s;cretion
had expo&s;ed them&s;elves both to the rigour of the laws
and to public hatred. He had recovered his former po|polarity
in the nation; and what probably plea&s;ed him
more than having a compliant Parliament, he was ena|bled
to govern altogether without one. But it is cer|tain,
that the King, amid&s;t all the&s;e promi&s;ing circum|&s;tances,
was not happy nor &s;atisfied. Whether he found
him&s;elf expo&s;ed to difficulties for want of money, or
dreaded a recoil of the popular humour from the pre&s;ent
arbitrary mea&s;ures, is uncertain. Perhaps the violent,
imprudent temper of the Duke, by pu&s;hing him upon
dangerous attempts, gave him apprehen&s;ion and unea&s;i|ne&s;s.
He was overheard to &s;ay one day, in oppo&s;ing &s;ome
of the Duke's ha&s;ty councils, &startq;Brother, I am too old
to go again to my travels: You may, if you choo&s;e
it.&endq; Whatever was the cau&s;e of the King's di&s;&s;ati&s;|faction,
it &s;eems very probable, that he was meditating
&s;ome change of mea&s;ures, and had formed a new plan of
admini&s;tration. He was determined, 'tis thought, to
&s;end the Duke to Scotland, to recall Monmonth, to
&s;ummon a Parliament, to di&s;mi&s;s all his unpopular mi|ni&s;ters,

and to throw him&s;elf entirely on the good will
and $ffection of his &s;ubjects. Amid&s;t the&s;e truly wi&s;e
and virtuous de&s;igns, he was &s;eized with a &s;udden fit,
which re&s;embled an apoplexy; and tho' he was reco|vered
from it by bleeding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's &s;ick|ne&s;s and death, 6th of Fe|bruary.</NOTE> he langui&s;hed only for a few days,
and then expired, in the fifty-fifth year of his age, and
twenty-fifth of his reign. He was &s;o happy in a good
con&s;titution of body, and had ever been &s;o remarkably
careful of his health, that his death &s;truck as great a
&s;urprize into his &s;ubjects, as if he had been in the flower
of his youth. And their inexpre&s;&s;ible concern for him, owing
to their affection for his per&s;on, as well as the dread of his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, very naturally, when joined to the critical
time of his death, begot the &s;u&s;picion of poi&s;on. All
circum&s;tances however con&s;idered, this &s;u&s;picion mu&s;t
be allowed to vani&s;h; like many others, of which all
hi&s;tories are full.</P>
<P>DURING the few days of the King's illne&s;s, clergy|men
of the church of England attended him; but he
di&s;covered a total indifference towards their devotions
and exhortations. Catholic prie&s;ts were brought, and
he received the &s;acrament from them, accompanied with
all the other rites of the Romi&s;h church. Two papers
were found in his clo&s;et, wrote with his own hand, and
containing arguments in favour of that communion.
The Duke had the imprudence immediately to publi&s;h
the&s;e papers; and thereby both confirmed all the re|proaches
of tho&s;e who had been the greate&s;t enemies to
his brother's mea&s;ures, and afforded to the whole world a
&s;pecimen of his own bigotry.</P>
<P>IF we &s;urvey the character of Charles the Second in the
different lights,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and cha|racter.</NOTE> which it will admit of, it will appear
very various, and give ri&s;e to different and even oppo&s;ite
fentiments. When con&s;idered as a companion, he ap|pears
the mo&s;t amiable and engaging of men; and in|deed,
in this view, his deportment mu&s;t be allowed al|together
<PB N="205" REF="255">
unexceptionable. His love of raillery was &s;o
tempered with good breeding, that it was never offen&s;ive:
His propen&s;ity to &s;atyre was &s;o checked with di&s;cretion,
that his friends never dreaded their becoming the object
of it: His wit, to u&s;e the expre&s;&s;ion of one, who knew
him well, and who was him&s;elf an exqui&s;ite judge<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">Marque&s;s of Hallifax.</NOTE>,
could not be &s;aid &s;o much to be very re&s;ined or elevated,
qualities apt to beget jealou&s;y and apprehen&s;ion in com|pany,
as to be a plain, gaining, well-bred, recommend|ing
kind of wit. And tho' perhaps he talked more
than &s;trict rules of behaviour might permit, men were
&s;o plea&s;ed with the affable, communicative deportment
of the Monarch, that they always went away contented
both with him and with them&s;elves. This indeed is the
mo&s;t &s;hining part of the King's character; and he &s;eems
to have been &s;en&s;ible of it: For he was fond of dropping
the formality of &s;tate, and of relap&s;ing every moment
into the companion.</P>
<P>IN the duties of private life, his conduct, tho' not
free from exception, was, in the main, laudable. He
was an ea&s;y generous lover, a civil obliging hu&s;band, a
friendly brother, an indulgent father, and a good natured
ma&s;ter<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Duke of Buckingham.</NOTE>. The voluntary friend&s;hips, however, which
this Prince contracted, nay, even his &s;en&s;e of gratitude,
were feeble; and he never attached him&s;elf to any of
his mini&s;ters or courtiers with a very &s;incere affection.
He believed them to have no other motive for &s;erving
him but &s;elf-intere&s;t, and he was &s;till ready, in his turn,
to &s;acrifice them to pre&s;ent ea&s;e or convenience.</P>
<P>WITH a detail of his private character we mu&s;t &s;et
bounds to our panegyric on Charles. The other parts
of his conduct may admit of &s;ome apology, but can
de&s;erve &s;mall applau&s;e. He was indeed &s;o much fitted
for private life, preferably to public, that he even po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
order, frugality, oeconomy in the former: Was
profu&s;e, thoughtle&s;s, negligent in the latter. When
<PB N="206" REF="256">
we con&s;ider him as a Sovereign, his character, tho' not
altogether void of virtues, was in the main dangerous
to his people, and di&s;honourable to him&s;elf. Negligent
of the intere&s;ts of the nation, carele&s;s of its glory,
aver&s;e to its religion, jealous of its liberty, lavi&s;h of its
trea&s;ure, &s;paring only of its blood; he expo&s;ed it by his
mea&s;ures, tho' he appeared ever but in &s;port, to the dan|ger
of a furious civil war, and even to the ruin and
ignominy of a foreign conque&s;t. Yet may all the&s;e enor|mities,
if fairly and candidly examined, be imputed, in
a great mea&s;ure, to the indolence of his temper; a fault,
which, however unfortunate in a Monarch, it is im|po&s;&s;ible
for us to regard with great &s;everity.</P>
<P>IT has been remarked of this King, that he never
&s;aid a fooli&s;h thing, nor ever did a wi&s;e one: A cen&s;ure,
which, tho' too far carried, &s;eems to have &s;ome founda|tion
in his character and deportment.</P>
<P>IF we reflect on the appetite for power, inherent in
human nature, and add to it, the King's education in
foreign countries, and among the Cavaliers, a party which
would naturally exaggerate the late u&s;urpations of po|pular
a&s;&s;emblies upon the rights of Monarchy; it is not
&s;urprizing, that civil liberty &s;hould not find in him a
very zealous patron. Harra&s;&s;ed with dome&s;tic factions,
weary of calumnies and complaints, oppre&s;&s;ed with debts,
&s;traitened in his revenue, he &s;ought, tho' with feeble
efforts, for a form of government, more &s;imple in its
&s;tructure and more ea&s;y in its management. But his
attachment to France, after all the pains, which we have
taken, by enquiry and conjecture, to fathom it, contains
&s;till &s;omething, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, my&s;terious and in|explicable.
The hopes of rendering him&s;elf ab&s;olute
by Lewis's a&s;&s;i&s;tance &s;eem &s;o chimerical, that they could
&s;carce be retained with &s;uch ob&s;tinacy by a Prince o$
Charles's penetration: And as to pecuniary &s;ub&s;idies&punc;
he &s;urely &s;pent much greater &s;ums in one &s;ea&s;on, during
the &s;econd Dutch war, than were remitted from France
<PB N="207" REF="257">
during the cour&s;e of his whole reign. I am apt there|fore
to imagine, that Charles was in this particular
guided chiefly by inclination, and by a prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion in
favour of the French nation. He con&s;idered that peo|ple
as gay, &s;prightly, polite, elegant, courteous, devoted
to their Prince, and attached to the catholic faith; and for
the&s;e rea&s;ons he cordially loved them. The oppo&s;ite
character of the Dutch, had rendered them the objects
of his aver&s;ion; and even the uncourtly humours of the
Engli&s;h made him very indifferent towards them. Men's
notions of intere&s;t are much warped by their affections;
and it is not altogether without example, that a man
may be guided by national prejudices, who has ever been
little bia&s;&s;ed by private and per&s;onal friend&s;hip.</P>
<P>THE character of this Prince has been very elaborately
drawn by two great ma&s;ters, perfectly well acquainted
with him, the duke of Buckingham and the marque&s;s of
Hallifax; not to mention &s;everal elegant &s;trokes given by
Sir William Temple. Dr. Welwood likewi&s;e and bi|&s;hop
Burnet have employed their pencil on the &s;ame &s;ub|ject:
But the former is &s;omewhat partial in his favour;
as the latter is by far too har&s;h and malignant. In&s;tead
of finding an exact parallel between Charles the Second
and the Emperor Tiberius, as that prelate pretends, it
would be more ju&s;t to remark a full contra&s;t and oppo|&s;ition.
The Emperor &s;eems as much to have &s;urpa&s;&s;ed
the King in abilities, as he falls &s;hort of him in virtue.
Provident, wi&s;e, active, jealous, malignant, dark, &s;ul|len,
un&s;ociable, re&s;erved, cruel, unrelenting, unfor|giving;
the&s;e are the lights, under which the Roman
tyrant has been tran&s;mitted to us. And the only cir|cum&s;tance,
in which, it can ju&s;tly be pretended, he was
&s;imilar to Charles, is his love of women; a pa&s;&s;ion,
which is too general to form any &s;triking re&s;emblance,
and which that dete&s;table and dete&s;ted mon&s;ter &s;hared al&s;o
with unnatural appetites.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t act of James's reign was to a&s;&s;emble the
privy council;<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's fir&s;t tran&s;actions.</NOTE> where, after &s;ome prai&s;es be&s;tow|ed
on the memory of his predece&s;&s;or, he made
profe&s;&s;ions of his re&s;olution to maintain the e&s;tabli&s;hed
government, both in church and &s;tate. Tho' he had
been reported, he &s;aid, to have imbibed very arbitrary
principles, he knew that the laws of England were &s;uf|ficient
to make him as great a Monarch as he could wi&s;h;
and he was determined never to depart from them. And
as he had heretofore ventured his life in defence of the
<PB N="209" REF="259">
nation, he would &s;till go as far as any man in maintain|ing
all its ju&s;t rights and liberties.</P>
<P>THIS di&s;cour&s;e was received with great applau&s;e, not
only by the council, but by the whole nation. The
King univer&s;ally pa&s;&s;ed for a man of great &s;incerity and
great honour; and as the current of favour ran at that
time for the Court, men believed, that his intentions were
conformable to his expre&s;&s;ions. &startq;We have now,&endq; it
was &s;aid, &startq;the word of a King; and a word never yet
broken.&endq; Addre&s;&s;es came from allquarters, full of
duty, nay, of the mo&s;t &s;ervile adulation. Every one
ha&s;tened to pay court to the new Monarch<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">The Quakers' addre&s;s was e&s;teemed &s;omewhat &s;ingular. It was con|ceived in the&s;e terms. &startq;We are come to te&s;tify our &s;orrow for the death of our good friend Charles, and our joy for thy being made our gover|nour. We are told thou art not of the per&s;wa&s;ion of the church of England, no more than we: Wherefore we hope thou wilt grant us the &s;ame liberty, which thou allowe&s;t thy&s;elf. Which doing, we wi&s;h thee all manner of happine&s;s.&endq;:</NOTE> And James
had rea&s;on to think, that, notwith&s;tanding the violent
efforts made by &s;o potent a party for his exclu&s;ion, no
throne in Europe was better e&s;tabli&s;hed than that of
England.</P>
<P>THE King, however, in the fir&s;t exerci&s;e of his au|thority,
&s;hewed, that either he was not &s;incere in his
profe&s;&s;ions of attachment to the laws, or that he had en|tertained
&s;o lofty an idea of his own legal power, that
even his utmo&s;t &s;incerity would tend very little to &s;ecure
the liberties of the people. All the cu&s;toms and the
greater part of the exci&s;e had been voted by Parliament
during the late King's life, and con&s;equently the grant
was now expired; nor had the &s;ucce&s;&s;or any right to
levy the&s;e branches of revenue. But James i&s;&s;ued a
proclamation, ordering the cu&s;toms and exci&s;e to be paid
as before; and this exertion of power he would not deign
to qualify by the lea&s;t act or even appearance of conde|&s;cen&s;ion.
It was propo&s;ed to him, that, in order to

prevent the ill effects of any intermi&s;&s;ion in levying the&s;e
duties, entries &s;hould be made, and bonds for the &s;uns
taken of the merchants: But the payment be &s;u&s;pended
till the Parliament &s;hould give authority to receive it.
This precaution was recommended as an expre&s;&s;ion of
deference to that a&s;&s;embly, or rather to the laws: But
for that very rea&s;on probably, it was rejected by the
King, who thought, that the Commons would thence
be invited to a&s;&s;ume more authority, and would regard
the whole revenue, and con&s;equently the whole power
of the Crown, as dependant on their good will and
plea&s;ure.</P>
<P>THE King likewi&s;e went openly, and with all the
en&s;igns of his dignity, to ma&s;s, an illegal meeting:
And by this imprudence he di&s;played at once his arbi|trary
di&s;po&s;ition, and the bigotry of his principles:
The&s;e two great characteri&s;tics of his reign and bane of
his admini&s;tration. He even &s;ent Caryl, as his agent to
Rome, to make &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions to the Pope, and to pave
the way for a &s;olemn readmi&s;&s;ion of England into the
bo$om of the catholic church. The Pope, Innocent the
XIth, very prudently advi&s;ed the King not to be too
precipitant in his mea&s;ures, nor ra&s;hly attempt what re|peated
experience might convince him was ab&s;olutely
impracticable. The Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador, Ronquillo,
deeming the tranquillity of England very requi&s;ite for the
&s;upport of Spain, u&s;ed the freedom to make like remon|&s;trances.
He ob&s;erved how bu&s;y the prie&s;ts appeared at
court, and advi&s;ed the King not to a&s;&s;ent with too great
facility to their dangerous councils. &startq;Is it not the
cu&s;tom of Spain,&endq; replied James, &startq;for the King to
con&s;ult with his confe&s;&s;or?&endq; &startq;Yes,&endq; &s;aid the amba&s;|&s;ador,
&startq;and 'tis for that very rea&s;on our affairs &s;ucceed
&startq;&s;o ill.&endq;</P>
<P>JAMES gave hopes on his acce&s;&s;ion, that he would
hold the ballance of power more &s;teadily than his pre|dece&s;&s;or;
<PB N="211" REF="263">
and that France, in&s;tead of rendering Eng|land
&s;ub&s;ervient to her ambitious projects, would now meet
with &s;trong oppo&s;ition from that Kingdom. Be|&s;ides
applying him&s;elf to bu&s;ine&s;&s; with great indu&s;try, he
&s;eemed jealous of national honour, and expre&s;&s;ed great
care, that no more re&s;pect &s;hould be payed the French
amba&s;&s;ador than his own received at Paris. But the&s;e
appearances were not &s;ufficiently &s;upported; and he found
him&s;elf by degrees under the nece&s;&s;ity of falling into an
union, at lea&s;t of pre&s;erving peace, with that great Mo|narch,
who, by his power as well as his zeal, &s;eemed
alone capable of a&s;&s;i&s;ting him, in the projects formed for
promoting the catholic religion in England.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING the King's prejudices, all the
chief offices of the Crown continued &s;till in the hands of
Prote&s;tants Roche&s;ter was lord high trea&s;urer; his bro|ther
Clarendon lord chamberlain; Godolphin chamber|lain
to the Queen; Sunderland &s;ecretary of &s;tate; Hal|lifax
pre&s;ident of the council. This nobleman had &s;tood
in oppo&s;ition to the King during the la&s;t years of Charles's
reign; and when he attempted, on the acce&s;&s;ion, to
make &s;ome apology for his late mea&s;ures, James very
genteely told him, that he would forget every thing that
was pa&s;t, except his behaviour during the exclu&s;ion bill.
In other re&s;pects, however, the King appeared not of
&s;o forgiving a temper. When the principal exclu&s;ioni&s;ts
came to pay their re&s;pects to their new Sovereign, they
either were not admitted, or were received very coldly,
&s;ometimes even with frowns. This conduct might &s;uit
the character, which the King &s;o much affected, of &s;ince|rity:
But by &s;howing, that a King of England could
re&s;ent the quarrels of a duke of Yorke, he gave his
people no high idea either of his lenity or magnanimity.</P>
<P>ON all occa&s;ions, the King was very free in declar|ing,
that men mu&s;t now look for a more active and more
vigilant government, and that he would retain no mi|ni&s;ters,

who did not practi&s;e an unre&s;erved obedience to
his commands. We are not indeed to look For the
&s;prings of his admini&s;tration &s;o much in his council and
chief officers of &s;tate, as in his own temper, and in the
character of tho&s;e per&s;ons, with whom he &s;ecretly con|&s;ulted.
The Queen had great influence over him; a
woman of &s;pirit, who&s;e conduct had been very popular,
till &s;he arrived at that high dignity. She was much go|verned
by the prie&s;ts, e&s;pecially the je&s;uits; and as the&s;e
were al&s;o the King's favourites, all public mea&s;ures were
taken originally from the &s;ugge&s;tions of the&s;e men, and
bore evident marks of their ignorance in government,
and of the violence of their religious zeal.</P>
<P>THE King however had another attachment, &s;eemingly
not very con&s;i&s;tent with this devoted regard to his Queen
and to his prie&s;ts: It was to Mrs. Sedley, whom he &s;oon
after created counte&s;s of Dorche&s;ter, and who expected
to govern him with the &s;ame authority, which the
dutche&s;s of Port&s;mouth had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed during the former
reign. But the King, who had entertained the ambition
of converting his people, was told, that the regularity of
his life ought to corre&s;pond to the &s;anctity of his inten|tions;
and he was prevailed with, at fir&s;t, to remove
Mrs. Sedley from Court: A re&s;olution in which he had
not the courage to per&s;evere. Good agreement between
the mi&s;tre&s;s and the confe&s;&s;or of Princes is not commonly
a difficult matter to compa&s;s: But in the pre&s;ent ca&s;e
the&s;e two potent engines of command were found very
incompatible. Mrs. Sedley, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed all the wit
and ingenuity of her father, Sir Charles, made the
prie&s;ts and their councils the perpetual objects of her rail|lery;
and it is not to be doubted, but they, on their
part, redoubled their exhortations with their penitent to
break off &s;o criminal an attachment.</P>
<P>HOWEVER little inclination the King, as well as his
Queen and prie&s;ts, might bear to an Engli&s;h Parliament,
<PB N="213" REF="267">
it was absolutely nece&s;&s;ary, at the beginning of a reign,
to &s;ummon that a&s;&s;embly. The low condition, into
which the Whigs or country party had fallen during the
la&s;t years of Charles's reign, the odium under which they
laboured on account of the Rye-hou&s;e con&s;piracy; the&s;e
cau&s;es made that party meet with little &s;ucce&s;s in the
new elections. The general re&s;ignation too of the char|ters
had made the corporations extremely dependent;
and the recommendations of the Court, tho' little a&s;|&s;i&s;ted,
at, that time, by pecuniary influence, were become
very prevalent.<NOTE PLACE="marg">A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> The new Hou&s;e of Commons therefore
con&s;i&s;ted almo&s;t entirely of zealous Tories and church|men;
and were of con&s;equence &s;trongly bya&s;&s;ed, by
their affections, to comply with the mea&s;ures of the
Crown.</P>
<P>THE di&s;cour&s;e, which the King made &startq;to the Parlia|ment,
was more fitted to work on their fears than their
affections.<NOTE PLACE="marg">19th of May.</NOTE> He repeated indeed, and with great &s;olem|nity,
the promi&s;e which he had made before the privy
council, of governing according to the laws, and of pre&s;erv|ing
the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion: Brit at the &s;ame time he told
them, that he po&s;itively expected they would &s;ettle his
brother. &startq;I might u&s;e many arguments,&endq; &s;aid he,
&startq;to in$orce this demand, the benefit of trade, the &s;up|port
of the navy, the nece&s;&s;ities of the Crown, and
the well-being of the government it&s;elf, which I mu&s;t
not &s;uffer to be precarious: But I am confident, that
your own con&s;ideration and your &s;en&s;e of what is
ju&s;t and rea&s;onable will &s;ugge&s;t to you whatever on
this occa&s;ion might be enlarged upon. There is
indeed one popular argument,&endq; added he, &startq;which
may be urged again&s;t compliance with my demand:
Men may think, that by feeding me from time to
time with &s;uch &s;upplies as they think convenient,
they will better &s;ecure frequent meetings of Parlia|ment:
<PB N="214" REF="268">
But as this is the fir&s;t time I &s;peak to you from
the throne, I mu&s;t plainly tell you, that &s;uch an ex|pedient
would be very improper to employ with me,
and that the be&s;t way to engage me to meet you often
is always to u&s;e me well.&endq;</P>
<P>IT was ea&s;y to interpret this language of the King.
He plainly intimated, that he had re&s;ources in his pre|rogative
for &s;upporting the government, independaent of
their &s;upplies; and that &s;o long as they complied with
his demands, he would have recour&s;e to them; but that
any ill u&s;age on their part would &s;et him free from tho&s;e
mea&s;ures of government, which he &s;eemed to regard
more as voluntary than as nece&s;&s;ary. It mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
that no Parliament in England was ever placed in
a more critical &s;ituation, nor where more forcible argu|ments
could be urged, either for their oppo&s;ition or com|pliance
with the Court.</P>
<P>IT was &s;aid on the one hand,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rea&s;ons for and again&s;t a revenue during life.</NOTE> that jealou&s;y of royal
power was the very ba&s;is of the Engli&s;h con&s;titution, and
the principle to which the nation was beholden for all
that liberty, which they enjoy above the &s;ubjects of other
monarchies. That this jealou&s;y, tho', at different peri|ods,
it may be more or le&s;s inten&s;e, can never &s;afely be
laid a&s;leep, even under the be&s;t and wi&s;e&s;t Princes. That
the character of the pre&s;ent Sovereign afforded cau&s;e
for the highe&s;t vigilance, by rea&s;on of the arbitrary prin|ciples,
which he had imbibed; and &s;till more, by rea|&s;on
of his religious zeal, which it is impo&s;&s;ible for him
ever to gratify, without a&s;&s;uming more authority than
the con&s;titution allows him. That power is to be
watched in its very fir&s;t encroachments; nor is any thing
ever gained by timidity and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. That every con|ce&s;&s;ion
adds new force to u&s;urpation; and at the &s;ame
time, by di&s;covering the da&s;tardly di&s;po&s;itions of the
people, in&s;pires it with new courage and enterprize.
That as arms were intru&s;ted altogether in the hands of the
<PB N="215" REF="269">
Prince, no check remained upon him but the dependant
condition of his revenue; a &s;ecurity therefore which it
would be the mo&s;t egregious folly to abandon. That all
the other barriers, which, of late years, had been
erected again&s;t arbitrary power, would be found, without
this capital article, to be rather pernicious and de&s;truct|ive.
That new limitations in the con&s;titution &s;timulated
the Monarch's inclination to &s;urmount the laws, and
required frequent meetings of Parliament, in order to re|pair
all the breaches, which either time or violence may
have made upon that complicated fabric. That recent
experience during the reign of the late King, a Prince
who wanted neither prudence nor moderation, had &s;uf|ficiently
proved the &s;olidity of all the&s;e maxims. That
his Parliament, having ra&s;hly fixed his revenue for life,
and at the &s;ame time repealed the triennial bill, found
that they them&s;elves were no longer of importance, and
that liberty, not protected by national a&s;&s;emblies, was
expo&s;ed to every outrage and violation. And that the
more openly the King made an unrea&s;onable demand,
the more ob&s;tinately ought it to be refu&s;ed; &s;ince it is
evident, that his purpo&s;e in making it cannot po&s;&s;ibly be
ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>ON the other hand it was urged, that the rule of
watching the very fir&s;t encroachments of power could
only have place, where the oppo&s;ition to it might be
regular, peaceful, and legal. That tho' the refu&s;al of
the King's pre&s;ent demand might &s;eem to be of this na|ture,
yet in reality it involved con&s;equences, which led
much farther than at fir&s;t &s;ight might be apprehended.
That the King in his &s;peech had plainly intimated, that
he had re&s;ources in his prerogative, which, in ca&s;e of
oppo&s;ition from Parliament, he thought him&s;elf &s;ully in|titled
to employ. That if the Parliament openly di&s;co|vered
an intention of reducing him to dependance, mat|ters
mu&s;t pre&s;ently be brought to a cri&s;is, at a time the
<PB N="216" REF="270">
mo&s;t favourable to his cau&s;e, which his mo&s;t &s;anguine
wi&s;hes could ever have promi&s;ed him. That if we ca&s;t
our eyes abroad, to the &s;tate of affairs on the conti|nent,
to the &s;ituation of Scotland and Ireland; or, what
is of more importance, if we con&s;ider the di&s;po&s;ition of
men's minds at home, every circum&s;tance would be
found adver&s;e to the cau&s;e of liberty. That the country
party, during the late reign, by their violent, and in
many re&s;pects unju&s;tifiable mea&s;ures in Parliament, by
their de&s;perate attempts out of Parliament, had expo&s;ed
their principles to public hatred, and had excited extreme
jealou&s;y in all the Royali&s;ts and zealous churchmen,
who now formed the bulk of the nation. That it would
not be acceptable to that party to &s;ee this King wor&s;e
treated than his brother in point of revenue, or any at|tempts
made to keep the Crown in dependance. That
they thought Parliaments as liable to abu&s;e as Monarchy,
and de&s;ired not to &s;ee things in a &s;ituation, where the
King could not, if he found it requi&s;ite, either pro|rogue
or di&s;&s;olve them. That if the pre&s;ent Parliament,
by making great conce&s;&s;ions, could gain the King's con|fidence,
and engage him to ob&s;erve the promi&s;es now
given them, every thing would by gentle methods &s;uc|ceed
to their wi&s;hes. That if, on the contrary, after
&s;uch in&s;tances of compliance, he formed any de&s;ign on
the liberties and religion of the nation, he would in the
eyes of all mankind render him&s;elf entirely inexcu&s;able,
and the whole people would join in oppo&s;ition to him.
That re&s;i&s;tance could &s;carce be attempted twice; and
there was therefore the greater nece&s;&s;ity of waiting till
time and incidents had prepared the minds of the nation
for it. That the King's prejudices in favour of popery,
tho' in the main pernicious, yet were &s;o far fortunate,
that they rendered the connexion in&s;eparable between
the national religion and national liberty. And that if
any illegal attempts were afterwards made, the church,
<PB N="217" REF="271">
which was at pre&s;ent the chief &s;ecurity of the Crown,
would &s;urely catch the alarm, and would &s;oon di&s;po&s;e
the people to an effectual re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>THESE la&s;t rea&s;ons, fortified by the prejudices and af|fections
of party, prevailed in Parliament; and the
Commons, be&s;ides thanks for the King's &s;peech, voted
unanimou&s;ly, that they would &s;ettle on the pre&s;ent King
during life all the revenue enjoyed by the late King at
the time of his decea&s;e. That they might not detract
from this genero&s;ity by any &s;ymptoms of di&s;tru&s;t, they
al&s;o voted unanimou&s;ly, that the Hou&s;e entirely relied
on his Maje&s;ty's royal word and repeated declarations to
&s;upport the religion of the church of England: but they
added, that that religion was dearer to them than their
lives. The &s;peaker, in pre&s;enting the revenue-bill, took
care to inform the King of the Commons' vote with re|gard
to religion: but could not, by &s;o &s;ignal a proof of
confidence, extort from him one word, in favour of that
religion, on which, he told his Maje&s;ty, they &s;et &s;o high
a value. Notwith&s;tanding the grounds of &s;u&s;picion,
which this &s;ilence afforded, the Hou&s;e continued in the
&s;ame liberal di&s;po&s;ition. The King having demanded a
farther &s;upply for the navy and other purpo&s;es, they re|vived
tho&s;e duties on wines and vinegar, which had been
once enjoyed by the late King; and they added &s;ome im|po&s;itions
on tobacco and &s;ugar. This grant amounted
on the whole to about &s;ix hundred thou&s;and pounds a
year.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Lords were in a humour no le&s;s com|pliant.
They even went &s;ome lengths towards breaking
in pieces all the remains of the popi&s;h plot; that once
formidable engine of bigotry and faction.</P>
<P>A LITTLE before the meeting of Parliament, Oates<NOTE PLACE="marg">Oates con|victed of perjury.</NOTE>
had been tried for perjury on two indictments. One for
&s;wearing, that he was pre&s;ent at a con&s;ult of je&s;uits in
London the twenty-fourth of April, 1679: Another for

<PB N="217" REF="273">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="218" REF="274">
&s;wearing, that father Ireland was in London between
the eighth and twelfth of Augu&s;t and on the beginning
of September in the &s;ame year. Never crimnal was con|victed
on fuller and more undoubted evidence. Two
and twenty per&s;ons, who had been &s;tudents at St. Omers,
mo&s;t of them men of credit and family, gave evidence,
that Oates had entered into that &s;eminary about Chri&s;t|mas
in the preceding year, and had never been ab&s;ent
but one night, till the month of July following. For|ty-&s;even
witne&s;&s;es, per&s;ons al&s;o of untainted character,
&s;wore that father Ireland, on the third of Augu&s;t, had
gone to Stafford&s;hire, where he re&s;ided till the middle of
September; and, what &s;ome years before would have
been regarded as a very material circum&s;tance, nine of
the&s;e witne&s;&s;es were Prote&s;tants of the church of Eng|land.
Oates's &s;entence was to be fined a thou&s;and marks
on each indictment, to be whipped on two different days
from Aldgate to Newgate, and from Newgate to Ty|burn,
to be impri&s;oned during life, and to be pilloried
five times every year. The impudence of the man &s;up|ported
it&s;elf under the conviction, and his courage un|der
the puni&s;hment. He made &s;olemn appeals to Heaven,
and protectations of the veracity of his te&s;timony: Tho'
the whipping was &s;o cruel, that it was evidently the in|tention
of the Court to put him to death by that puni&s;h|ment,
he was enabled, by the care of his friends, to re|cover:
And he lived to King William's reign; when he
had a pen&s;ion of four hundred pounds a year &s;ettled on
him. A con&s;iderable number &s;till adhered to him in his
di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and regarded him as the martyr of the prote|&s;tant
cau&s;e. The populace were affected with the &s;ight
of a puni&s;hment, more &s;evere than is commonly exer|ci&s;ed
in England. And the &s;entence of perpetual im|pri&s;onment was deemed illegal.</P>
<P>THE conviction of Oates's perjury was taken notice of by
the hou&s;e of Peers. Be&s;ides freeing the popi&s;h lords, Powis,
<PB N="219" REF="275">
Arundel, Bella&s;is, and Tyrone, together with Danby,
from the former impeachment by the Commons, they
went &s;o far as to vote a rever&s;al of Stafford's attainder,
on account of the fal&s;hood of that evidence, on which
he had been condemned. This bill fixed &s;o deep a &s;tain on
the former proceedings of the exclu&s;ioni&s;ts, that it met
with great oppo&s;ition among the Lords; and it was at
la&s;t, after one reading, dropped by the Commons. Tho'
the reparation of inju&s;tice be the &s;econd honour, which
a nation can attain; the pre&s;ent emergence &s;eemed very
improper for granting &s;o full a ju&s;tification of the ca|tholics,
and throwing &s;o &s;ignal an imputation on the Pro|te&s;tants.</P>
<P>THE cour&s;e of parliamentary proceedings was inter|rupted
by the news of<NOTE PLACE="marg">Mon|mouth's in|va&s;ion.</NOTE> Monmouth's arrival on the we&s;t
coa&s;t with three &s;hips from Holland. No &s;ooner was
this intelligence conveyed to the Parliament, than they
voted, that they would adhere to his Maje&s;ty with their
lives and fortunes. They pa&s;&s;ed a bill of attainder again&s;t
Monmouth: and they granted a &s;upply of four hundred
thou&s;and pounds for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing this rebellion. After
having thus &s;trengthened the hands of the King, they
adjourned them&s;elves.</P>
<P>MONMOUTH, when ordered to depart the kingdom,
during the late reign, had retired to Holland; and as it
was well known, that he was &s;till much favoured by his
indulgent father, all marks of honour and di&s;tinction
were be&s;towed upon him by the Prince of Orange. Af|ter
the acce&s;&s;ion of James, the Prince thought proper
to di&s;mi&s;s Monmouth and all his followers; and that
illu&s;trious fugitive retired to Bru&s;&s;els. Finding him&s;elf
&s;till pur&s;ued by the King's &s;everity, he was pu&s;hed, con|trary
to his judgment as well as inclination, to make a
very ra&s;h and premature attempt upon England. He &s;aw
that the King had lately mounted the Throne, not only
without oppo&s;ition, but &s;eemingly with the good will

<PB N="219" REF="277">

and affections of his &s;ubjects. A Parliament was &s;it|ting,
which di&s;covered the greate&s;t di&s;po&s;ition to com|ply
with the Court, and who&s;e adherence to the Crown,
he knew, would give a &s;anction and authority to all pu|blic
mea&s;ures. The grievances of this reign were hitherto
incon&s;iderable; and the people were not as yet in a di&s;|po&s;ition
to remark them with great &s;everity. All the&s;e
con&s;iderations occurred to Monmouth; but &s;uch was the
impatience of his followers, &s;uch the precipitate humour
of Argyle, who &s;et out for Scotland a little before him,
that no rea&s;ons could be attended to; and this unhappy
man was drove upon his fate.</P>
<P>THE imprudence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">11th of June.</NOTE> however, of this enterprize did
not at fir&s;t appear. Tho' on his landing at Lime in
Dor&s;et&s;hire, he had cearce a hundred followers; &s;o po|pular
was his name, that in four days he had a&s;&s;embled
above two thou&s;and hor&s;e and foot. They were indeed
almo&s;t all of them, the lowe&s;t of the people; and his
declaration was chiefly calculated to &s;uit the prejudices
of the vulgar, or the mo&s;t bigotted of the whig-party.
He called the King, Duke of Yorke; and denominated
him a traitor, a tyrant, a murderer, a popi&s;h u&s;urper
He imputed to him the fire of London, the murder of
Godfrey and of E&s;&s;ex, nay the poi&s;oning the late King.
And he invited all the people to join in oppo&s;ition to his
tyranny.</P>
<P>THE duke of Albemarle, &s;on to him who had re&s;tored
the Royal Family, &s;ummoned together the militia of
Devon&s;hire to the number of 4000 men, and took po&s;t
at Axmin&s;ter, in order to oppo&s;e the rebels; but ob&s;erv|ing,
that his troops bore a great affection to Monmouth,
he thought proper to retire. Monmouth, tho' he had
formerly given many &s;ignal proofs of per&s;onal courage,
had not the vigour of mind requi&s;ite for an undertaking
of this nature. From an ill grounded diffidence of his
men, he neglected to attack Albemarle; an ea&s;y enter|prize,
<PB N="221" REF="279">
by which he might both have acquired credit and
&s;upplied him&s;elf with arms. Lord Gray, who com|manded
his hor&s;e, di&s;covered him&s;elf to be a notorious
coward; yet &s;uch was the &s;oftne&s;s of Monmouth's na|ture,
that Gray was &s;till continued in his command.
Fletcher of Salton, a Scot&s;man, a per&s;on of &s;ignal pro|bity
and fine genius, had been engaged by his republi|can
principles in this enterprize, and commanded the
cavalry together with Gray: But being in&s;ulted by one,
who had newly joined the army, and who&s;e hor&s;e he had
in a hurry made u&s;e of, he was prompted by pa&s;&s;ion, to
which he was much &s;ubject, to di&s;charge a pi&s;tol at the
man; and he killed him on the &s;pot. This accident ob|liged
him immediately to leave the camp; and the lo&s;s of
&s;o gallant an officer was a great prejudice to Monmouth's
enterprize.</P>
<P>THE next &s;tation of the rebels was Taunton, a very
di&s;affected town, which gladly and even fondly received
them, and re-inforced them with con&s;iderable numbers.
Twenty young maids of &s;ome rank pre&s;ented Monmouth
with a pair of colours of their handiwork, together with
a copy of the bible. Monmouth was here per&s;uaded to
take upon him the title of King, and a&s;&s;ert the le|gitimacy
of his birth; a claim, which he advanced in
his fir&s;t declaration, but who&s;e di&s;cu&s;&s;ion he was deter|mined,
he then &s;aid, during &s;ome time to po&s;tpone. His
numbers had now increa&s;ed to &s;ix thou&s;and men; and
he was obliged every day, for want of arms, to di&s;mi&s;s a
great many, who crowded to his &s;tandard. He entered
Bridgewater, Wells, Frome; and was proclaimed in all
the&s;e places: But forgetting, that &s;uch de&s;perate enter|prizes
can only be rendered &s;ucce&s;sful by the mo&s;t adven|turous
courage, he allowed the expectations of the' peo|ple
to langui&s;h, without attempting any con&s;iderable un|dertaking.</P>
<P><PB N="222" REF="280">
WHILE Monmouth by his imprudent and ill-timed
caution, was thus wa&s;ting time in the We&s;t, the King
employed him&s;elf in making preparations to oppo&s;e him.
Six regiments of Briti&s;h troops were called over from
Holland: The army was con&s;iderably augmented: And
regular forces, to the number of 3000 men, were di&s;|patched
under the command of Fever&s;ham and Churchill,
in order to check the progre&s;s of the rebels.</P>
<P>MONMOUTH, ob&s;erving that no con&s;iderable men
joined him, finding that an in&s;urrection which was pro|jected
in the city had not taken place, hearing that Ar|gyle,
his confederate, was already defeated and taken;
&s;unk into &s;uch de&s;pondency, that he had once re&s;olved
to withdraw him&s;elf, and leave his unhappy followers to
their fate. His followers expre&s;&s;ed more courage than
their leader, and &s;eemed determined to adhere to him in
every fortune.<NOTE PLACE="marg">5th of July. Monmouth defeated,</NOTE> The negligent di&s;po&s;ition made by Fe|ver&s;ham,

action &s;howed what a native courage and a principle of
duty, even when una&s;&s;i&s;ted by di&s;cipline, is able to per|form.
They made great impre&s;&s;ion on the veteran forces;
drove them from their ground; continued the fight till
their ammunition failed them; and would at la&s;t have
obtained a victory, had not the mi&s;conduct of Monmouth
and the cowardice of Gray prevented it. After a con|te&s;t
of three hours the rebels gave way; and were fol|lowed
with great &s;laughter. About 1500 fell in the
battle and pur&s;uit. And thus was concluded in a few
weeks this enterprize, ra&s;hly undertaken, and feebly
conducted.</P>
<P>MONMOUTH fled from the field of battle above twenty
miles, till his hor&s;e &s;unk under him. He then changed
cloaths with a pea&s;ant, in order to conceal him&s;elf. The
pea&s;ant was found by the pur&s;uers, who now redoubled
<PB N="223" REF="281">
the diligence of their &s;earch. At la&s;t, the unhappy
Monmouth was di&s;covered, lying in the bottom of a
ditch, and covered with fern: His body depre&s;&s;ed with
fatigue and hunger; his mind by the memory of pa&s;t
misfortunes, by the pro&s;pect of future di&s;a&s;ters. Hu|man
nature is unequal to &s;uch calamitous &s;ituations;
much more, the temper of a man, &s;oftened by early
pro&s;perity, and accu&s;tomed to value him&s;elf chiefly on
military bravery. He bur&s;t into tears, when &s;eized by
his enemies; and he &s;eemed &s;till to indulge the fond
hope and de&s;ire of life. Tho' he might have known,
from the greatne&s;s of his own offences, and the &s;everity
of James's temper, that no mercy could be expected, he
wrote him the mo&s;t &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive letters, and conjured him
to &s;pare the blood of a brother, who had ever been &s;o
&s;trongly attached to his intere&s;ts. James, finding &s;uch
&s;ymptoms of depre&s;&s;ion and de&s;pondency in the unhappy
pri&s;oner, admitted him to his pre&s;ence, in hopes of ex|torting
a di&s;covery of his accomplices: But Monmouth
would not purcha&s;e life, however loved, at the price of
&s;o much infamy. Finding all efforts vain, he a&s;&s;umed
courage from de&s;pair, and prepared him&s;elf for death,
with a &s;pirit, better &s;uited to his rank and character.
This favourite of the people was attended to the &s;caf|fold
with a plentiful effu&s;ion of tears. He warned the
executioner not to fall into the error which he had com|mitted
in b$heading Ru&s;&s;el,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and exe|cuted, 15th of July.</NOTE> where it had been nece&s;&s;ary
to redouble the blow. This precaution &s;erved only to
di&s;may the executioner. He &s;truck a feeble blow on
Monmouth, who rai&s;ed his head from the block, and
looked him in the face, as if reproaching him for his
failure. He gently laid down his head a &s;econd time;
and the executioner &s;truck him again and again to no
purpo&s;e. He at la&s;t threw a&s;ide the ax, and cried out
that he was incapable of fini&s;hing the bloody office. The
&s;heriff obliged him to renew the attempt; and at two
blows more the head was &s;evered from the body.</P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="282">
THUS peri&s;hed in the thirty-&s;ixth year of his age a
nobleman, who, in le&s;s turbulent times, was well qua|lified
to be an ornament to the Court, even to be &s;er|viceable
to his country. The favour of his Prince, the
care&s;&s;es of faction, the allurements of popularity, &s;e|duced
him into enterprizes, which exceeded his capa|city.
The good will of the people &s;till followed him in
every fortune. Even after his execution, their fond cre|dulity
flattered them with hopes of &s;eeing him once more
at their head. They believed, that the per&s;on executed
was not Monmouth, but one, who, having the fortune
to re&s;emble him nearly, was willing to give this proof of
his extreme attachment, and to &s;uffer death in his &s;tead.</P>
<P>THIS victory, obtained by the King in the commence|ment
of his reign, would naturally, had it been pru|dently
managed, have tended much to encrea&s;e his power
and authority. But by rea&s;on of the cruelty, with which
it was pro&s;ecuted, and of the temerity, which it after|wards
occa&s;ioned, it was a principal cau&s;e of his &s;udden
ruin and downfall.</P>
<P>SUCH arbitrary principles had the Court in&s;tilled into
all its &s;ervants, that Fever&s;ham, immediately after the
victory, hanged up above twenty pri&s;oners; and was
proceeding in his executions, when the bi&s;hop of Bath
and Wells warned him, that the&s;e unhappy men were
now by law entitled to a trial, and that their execution
would be deemed a real murther. This remon&s;trance
however did not &s;top the &s;avage nature of colonel Kirke,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Cruelty of colonel Kirke.</NOTE>
a &s;oldier of fortune, who had long &s;erved at Tangiers,
and had contracted from his habitudes with the Moors,
an inhumanity le&s;s known in European and in free coun|tries.
At his fir&s;t entry into Bridgewater, he hanged
nineteen without the lea&s;t enquiry into the merits of
their cau&s;e. As if to make &s;port with death, he or|dered
a certain number to be executed, while he and
his company &s;hould drink to the King's health, or to the
<PB N="225" REF="283">
queen's, or to judge Jefferies's. Ob&s;erving their feet
to &s;hake in the agonies of death, he cried that he would
give them mu&s;ic to their dancing; and he immediately
commanded the drums to beat and the trumpets to &s;ound.
By way of experiment, he ordered one man to be hung
up three times, que&s;tioning him at every interval, whe|ther
he repented of his crime: But the man ob&s;tinately
a&s;&s;erting, that, notwith&s;tanding all the pa&s;t, he would
&s;till willingly engage in the &s;ame cau&s;e, Kirke ordered
him to be hung in chains. One &s;tory, commonly told
of him, is memorable for the treachery, as well as bar|barity,
which attended it. A young maid pleaded for
the life of her brother, and flung her&s;elf at Kirke's feet,
armed with all the charms, which beauty and innocence,
bathed in tears, could be&s;tow upon her. The tyrant
was inflamed with de&s;ire, not &s;oftened into love or cle|mency.
He promi&s;ed to grant her reque&s;t, provided
that &s;he, in her turn, would be equally compliant to
him. The maid yielded to the conditions: But after &s;he
had pa&s;&s;ed the night with him, the wanton &s;avage, next
morning, &s;howed her from the window her brother,
the darling object for whom &s;he had &s;acrificed her virtue,
hanged on a gibbet, which he had &s;ecrectly ordered to be
there erected for his execution. Rage and de&s;pair and
indignation took po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her mind, and deprived
her for ever of her &s;en&s;es. All the inhabitants of that
country, innocent as well as guilty, were expo&s;ed to the
ravages of this barbarian. The &s;oldiery were let loo&s;e
to live on free quarter; and his own regiment, in&s;tructed
by his example, and encouraged by his exhortations,
di&s;tingui&s;hed them&s;elves in a more particular manner by
their outrages. By way of plea&s;antry he u&s;ed to deno|minate
them <HI>his lambs;</HI> an appellation, which was long
remembered with horror in the we&s;t of England.</P>
<P>THE cruel Jefferies &s;ucceeded after &s;ome interval;
and &s;howed the people, that the rigours of the law
<PB N="226" REF="284">
might equal, if not exceed, the ravages of military
tyranny. This man, who wantoned in cruelty, had al|ready
given a &s;pecimen of his character in many trials,
where he had pre&s;ided; and he now &s;et out with a &s;avage
joy as to a full harve&s;t of death and de&s;truction. He
began at Dorche&s;ter; and thirty rebels being arraigned,
he exhorted them, but in vain, to &s;ave him, by their free
confe&s;&s;ion, the trouble of trying them: And when twenty-nine
were found guilty, he ordered them, as an ad|ditional
puni&s;hment of their di&s;obedience, to be led to
immediate execution. Mo&s;t of the other pri&s;oners, terri|fied
with this example, pleaded guilty; and no le&s;s than
two hundred and ninety-two received &s;entence at Dor|che&s;ter.
Of the&s;e eighty were executed. Exeter was
the next &s;tage of his cruelty: Two hundred and forty-three
were there tried, of whom a great number were
condemned and executed. He al&s;o opened his commi&s;&s;ion
at Taunton and Wells; and every where carried terror
and a&s;toni&s;hment along with him. The juries were &s;o
&s;truck with his menaces, that they gave their verdict
with precipitation, and many innocent per&s;ons were in|volved
with the guilty. And on the whole, be&s;ides tho&s;e
butchered by the military commanders, two hundred
and fifty-one are computed to have fallen by the hand of
ju&s;tice. The whole country was &s;trowed with the heads
and limbs of traitors. Every village almo&s;t beheld the
dead carca&s;s of a wretched inhabitant. And all the ri|gours
of ju&s;tice, unabated by any appearance of cle|mency,
were fully di&s;played to the people by the in|human
Jefferies.</P>
<P>OF all the executions during this di&s;mal period, the
mo&s;t remarkable were tho&s;e of Mrs. Gaunt and Lady
Li&s;le, who had been accu&s;ed of harbouring traitors.
Mrs. Gaunt was an Anabapti&s;t, noted for her benefi|cence,
which &s;he extended to per&s;ons of all profe&s;&s;ions
and per&s;wa&s;ions. One of the robels, knowing her hu|mane
<PB N="227" REF="285">
character, had recour&s;e to her in his di&s;tre&s;s, and
was concealed by her. Hearing of the proclamation,
which offered an indemnity and rewards to &s;uch as di&s;|covered
criminals, he ba&s;ely betrayed his benefactre&s;s,
and bore evidence again&s;t her. He received a pardon for
his treachery; &s;he was burned alive for her charity.</P>
<P>LADY LISLE was widow of one of the Regicides,
who had enjoyed great favour and authority under Crom|wel,
and who having fled, after the re&s;toration, to Lau|zunne
in Swi&s;&s;erland, was there a&s;&s;a&s;&s;inated by three Iri&s;h
ruffians, who hoped to make their fortune by this infa|mous
piece of &s;ervice. His widow was now pro&s;ecuted for
harbouring two rebels the day after the battle of Sedge|moor;
and Jefferies pu&s;hed on the trial with the mo&s;t
unrelenting violence. In vain did the aged pri&s;oner plead,
that the&s;e criminals had been put into no proclamation,
had been convicted by no verdict; nor could any man
be denominated a traitor, till the &s;entence of &s;ome legal
court was pa&s;&s;ed upon him: That it appeared not by any
proof, that &s;he was &s;o much as acquainted with the guilt
of the per&s;ons, or had heard of their joining the rebel|lion
of Monmouth: That tho' &s;he might be obnoxious
on account of her family, it was well known, that her
heart was ever loyal, and that no per&s;on in Eng|land
had &s;hed more tears for that fatal event, in
which her hu&s;band had unfortunately bore too great
a &s;hare: And that the &s;ame principles, which &s;he her&s;elf
had ever embraced, &s;he had carefully in&s;tilled into her
&s;on, and had, at that very time, &s;ent him to fight again&s;t
tho&s;e rebels, whom &s;he was now accu&s;ed of harbouring.
Tho' the&s;e arguments did not move Jefferies, they had
influence on the jury. Twice they &s;eemed inclined to
bring in a favourable verdict: They were as often &s;ent
back with menaces and reproaches; and at la&s;t were
con&s;trained to give &s;entence again&s;t the pri&s;oner. Not|with&s;tanding
all applications for pardon, the cruel &s;en|tence
<PB N="228" REF="286">
was executed. The King &s;aid, that he had given
Jefferies a promi&s;e not to pardon her: An excu&s;e, which
could &s;erve only to aggravate the blame again&s;t him&s;elf.</P>
<P>ONE might have hoped, that, by all the&s;e bloody execu|tions,
a rebellion, &s;o precipitate, &s;o ill &s;upported, and of
&s;uch &s;hort duration, would have been &s;ufficiently expi|ated:
But nothing could &s;atiate the &s;pirit of rigour,
which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the admini&s;tration Even tho&s;e multi|tudes,
who received pardon, were obliged to attone for
their guilt by fines, which reduced them to beggary; or
where their former poverty made them incapable of pay|ment,
they were condemned to cruel whippings or &s;e|vere
impri&s;onments. Nor could the innocent e&s;cape the
hands, equally rapacious as cruel, of the chief ju&s;tice.
Prideaux, a gentleman of Devon&s;hire, being thrown into
pri&s;on, and terrified with the &s;evere and arbitrary mea|&s;ures,
which at that time met with no controul, was
obliged to buy his liberty of Jefferies at the price of fif|teen
thou&s;and pounds; tho' he could never &s;o much as
learn the crime of which he was accu&s;ed.</P>
<P>GOODENOUGH, the &s;editious under-&s;heriff of London,
who had been engaged in the mo&s;t bloody and de&s;perate
part of the Rye-hou&s;e con&s;piracy, was taken pri&s;oner af|ter
the battle of Sedgemoor, and was re&s;olved to &s;ave his
own life, by an accu&s;ation of Corni&s;h, the &s;heriff, whom
he knew to be extremely obnoxious to the Court. Co|lonel
Rum&s;ey joined him in the accu&s;ation; and the pro|&s;ecution
was &s;o ha&s;tened, that the pri&s;oner was tried, con|demned,
and executed in the &s;pace of a week. The
perjury of the witne&s;&s;es appeared immediately after; and
the King &s;eemed to regret the execution of Corni&s;h. He
granted his e&s;tate to his family, and condemned the wit|ne&s;&s;es
to perpetual impri&s;onment.</P>
<P>THE inju&s;tice of this &s;entence again&s;t Corni&s;h, was
not required to di&s;gu&s;t the nation again&s;t the Court:
The continued rigour of the other executions had al|ready
<PB N="229" REF="287">
impre&s;&s;ed an univer&s;al hatred towards the mini&s;ters
of ju&s;tice, attended with a compa&s;&s;ion for the unhappy
&s;ufferers, who, as they had been &s;educed into this crime
by mi&s;taken principles, bore their puni&s;hment with the
&s;pirit and zeal of martyrs. The people might have been
willing on this occa&s;ion to di&s;tingui&s;h between the King
and his mini&s;ters: But care was taken to prove, that the
latter had done nothing but what was agreeable to their
ma&s;ter. Jefferies, on his return, was immediately, for
tho&s;e eminent &s;ervices, created a peer; and was &s;oon af|ter
ve&s;ted with the dignity of chancellor. No body could
then doubt but that the King intended to rule more by
fear than love, and that he was not aver&s;e to the cruelties
which had been practi&s;ed.</P>
<P>WE mu&s;t now take a view of the &s;tate of affairs in
Scotland;<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of af|fairs in Scotland.</NOTE> where the fate of Argyle had been decided
before that of Monmouth. Immediately after the King's
acce&s;&s;ion, a Parliament had been &s;ummoned at Edin|burgh;
and all affairs were there conducted by the duke
of Queen&s;bery the commi&s;&s;ioner, and the earl of Perth
the chancellor. The former had re&s;olved to make an
entire &s;urrender of the liberties of his country; but was
determined &s;till to adhere to its religion: The latter en|tertained
no &s;cruples of paying court even by the &s;acrifice
of both. But no courtiers, even the mo&s;t pro&s;titute,
could go farther than the Parliament it&s;elf, towards a re|&s;ignation
of their liberties. In a vote, which they called
an offer of duty, after adopting the fabulous hi&s;tory of
an hundred and eleven Scots Monarchs, they acknow|ledged,
that all the&s;e Princes, by the primary and fun|damental
law of the &s;tate, had been ve&s;ted with a <HI>&s;olid</HI>
and <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> authority. They declared their abhorrence
of all principles and po&s;itions, derogatory to the King's
&s;acred, &s;upreme, &s;overeign, ab&s;olute power, of which
none, they &s;aid, whether &s;ingle per&s;ons or collective bo|dies,
can participate, but in dependance on him and by
<PB N="230" REF="288">
commi&s;&s;ion from him. They promi&s;ed, that the whole
nation, between &s;ixty and &s;ixteen, &s;hall be in readine&s;s
for his Maje&s;ty's &s;ervice, where and as oft as it &s;hall be
his royal plea&s;ure to require them. And they annexed
the whole exci&s;e both of inland and foreign commodities
for ever to the Crown.</P>
<P>ALL the other acts of this a&s;&s;embly &s;avoured of the
&s;ame &s;pirit. They declared it high trea&s;on for any per|&s;on
to refu&s;e the te&s;t, if tendered by the council. To
defend the obligation of the covenant, &s;ubjected a per|&s;on
to the &s;ame penalty. To be pre&s;ent at any conven|ticle,
was made puni&s;hable with death and confi&s;cation
of goods. Even &s;uch as refu&s;ed to give te&s;timony, ei|ther
in ca&s;es of trea&s;on or nonconformity, were declared
equally puni&s;hable as if guilty of tho&s;e very crimes: An
excellent prelude to all the rigours of an inqui&s;ition. It
mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, that nothing could equal the abject
&s;ervility of the Scotch nation during this period but the
arbitrary &s;everity of the admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>IT was in vain, that Argyle &s;ummoned a nation,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Argyle's inva&s;ion,</NOTE> &s;o
lo&s;t to all &s;en&s;e of liberty, &s;o degraded by repeated in|dignities,
to ri&s;e in vindication of their violated laws
and privileges. The greater part of tho&s;e who declared
for him, were his own va&s;&s;als; men, who, if po&s;&s;ible,
were &s;till more &s;unk in &s;lavery than the re&s;t of the na|tion.
He arrived, after a pro&s;perous voyage, in Ar|gyle&s;hire,
attended by &s;ome fugitives from Holland; and
among the re&s;t, by Sir Patric Hume, a man of mild
di&s;po&s;itions, who had been driven to this extremity by a
continued train of oppre&s;&s;ion. The privy council was
apprized of Argyle's intentions. The whole militia of
the kingdom, to the number of twenty-two thou&s;and men,
were already in arms; and a third part of them, with
all the regular forces, were on their march to oppo&s;e
him. All the con&s;iderable gentry of his clan were thrown
into pri&s;on. And two &s;hips of war were on the coa&s;t
<PB N="231" REF="289">
to watch his motions. Under all the&s;e di&s;couragements
he yet made a &s;hift, partly from terror, partly from af|fection,
to collect and arm a body of about two thou|&s;and
five hundred men; but &s;oon found him&s;elf &s;urrounded
on all &s;ides with in&s;uperable difficulties. His arms and
ammunition were &s;eized: His provi&s;ions cut off: The
marque&s;s of Athole pre&s;&s;ed him on one &s;ide; lord Charles
Murray on another; the Duke of Gordon hung upon
his rear;<NOTE PLACE="marg">defeat,</NOTE> the earl of Dunbarton met him in front. His
followers daily fell off from him; but Argyle, re&s;olute
to per&s;evere, broke at la&s;t with the &s;hattered remains of
his troops into the di&s;affected part of the low countries,
which he had endeavoured to allure to him by declara|tions
for the covenant. No per&s;on &s;howedei ther courage
or inclination to join him; and his &s;mall and &s;till de|crea&s;ing
army, after wandering about for a little time,
was at la&s;t defeated and di&s;&s;olved without an enemy.
Argyle him&s;elf was &s;eized and carried to Edinburgh;<NOTE PLACE="marg">and execu|tion.</NOTE>
where, after enduring many indignities with a gallant
&s;pirit, he was publickly executed. He &s;uffered upon the
former unju&s;t &s;entence, which had been pa&s;&s;ed upon him.
The re&s;t of his followers either e&s;caped or were pardoned;
all except Rombold and Ayloffe, two Engli&s;hmen, who
had attended him on this expedition.</P>
<P>THE King was &s;o elated with this continued tide of
pro&s;perity,<NOTE PLACE="marg">9th of No|vember. A Parlia|ment.</NOTE> that he began to undervalue even an Engli&s;h
Parliament, at all times formidable to his family; and
from his &s;peech to both Hou&s;es, whom he had a&s;&s;embled
early in the winter, he &s;eemed to think him&s;elf exempt|ed
from all rules of prudence or nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;&s;imula|tion
He plainly told the two hou&s;es, that the militia,
which had formerly been &s;o much magnified, was now
found, by the experience of the la&s;t rebellion, to be al|together
u&s;ele&s;s; and he required a new &s;upply, in order
to maintain tho&s;e additional forces, which he had levied.
The al&s;o took notice, that he had employed a great many
<PB N="232" REF="290">
catholic officers, and that he had, in their favour, di&s;|pen&s;ed
with the law, requiring the te&s;t to be taken by
every one who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed any public office. And to cut
&s;hort all oppo&s;ition, he declared, that, having reaped
the benefit of their &s;ervice during &s;uch times of danger,
he was determined, neither to expo&s;e them afterwards to
di&s;grace, nor him&s;elf, in ca&s;e of another rebellion, to
the want of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>SUCH violent aver&s;ion did this Parliament bear to op|po&s;ition;
&s;o great dread had been in&s;tilled of the con|&s;equences
attending any breach with the King; that it is
probable, had he u&s;ed his di&s;pen&s;ing power without de|claring
it, no enquiries would have been made, and
time might have reconciled the nation to this dangerous
exerci&s;e of the prerogative. But to invade at once their
con&s;titution, to threaten their religion, to e&s;tabli&s;h a
&s;tanding army, and even to require them, by their con|currence,
to contribute towards all the&s;e mea&s;ures, ex|ceeded
the bounds of their patience, and they began,
for the fir&s;t time, to di&s;play &s;ome &s;mall remains of Eng|li&s;h
&s;pirit and genero&s;ity. When the King's &s;peech
was taken into con&s;ideration by the Commons, many &s;e|vere
reflections were thrown out again&s;t the pre&s;ent mea|&s;ures;
and the Hou&s;e was with &s;eeming difficulty en|gaged
to promi&s;e in a general vote, that they would grant
&s;ome &s;upply. But in&s;tead of fini&s;hing that bu&s;ine&s;s,
which could alone render them acceptable to the King,
they proceeded to examine the di&s;pen&s;ing power; and
they voted an addre&s;s to the King again&s;t it. Before this
addre&s;s was pre&s;ented, they re&s;umed the con&s;ideration of
the &s;upply; and as one million two hundred thou&s;and
pounds were demanded by the Court, and two hundred
thou&s;and pounds propo&s;ed by the country-party, a mid|dle
cour&s;e was cho&s;en, and &s;even hundred thou&s;and
pounds, after &s;ome di&s;pute, were at la&s;t voted. The
addre&s;s again&s;t the di&s;pen&s;ing power was expre&s;&s;ed in the
<PB N="233" REF="291">
mo&s;t re&s;pectful and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive manner; yet was it very
ill received by the King, and his an&s;wer contained a
flat denial, uttered with great warmth and vehemence.
The Commons were &s;o daunted with this reply, that
they kept &s;ilence a long time; and when Coke, member
for Derby, ro&s;e up and &s;aid, &startq;I hope we are all Engli&s;h|men,
and not to be frighted with a few hard words;&endq;
&s;o little &s;pirit appeared in that a&s;&s;embly, often &s;o refrac|tory
and mutinous, that they &s;ent him to the Tower for
bluntly expre&s;&s;ing a free and generous &s;entiment. They
adjourned, without fixing a day for the con&s;ideration of
his Maje&s;ty's an&s;wer; and on their next meeting, they
very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ively proceeded to the con&s;ideration of the
&s;upply, and even went &s;o far as to e&s;tabli&s;h funds for
paying the &s;um voted, in nine years and a half. The
King, therefore, had in effect, almo&s;t without &s;truggle
or violence, obtained a total victory over the Commons;
and in&s;tead of conte&s;ting for their liberties, now ex|po&s;ed
to manife&s;t danger, they even conferred an addi|tional
revenue to the Crown; and rendering the King
in &s;ome degree independent, contributed to encrea&s;e tho&s;e
imminent dangers, with which they had &s;o good rea&s;on
to be alarmed.</P>
<P>THE next oppo&s;ition came from the Hou&s;e of Peers,
which has not commonly taken the lead on the&s;e occa|&s;ions,
and even from the bench of bi&s;hops, whence the
Court u&s;ually expects the greate&s;t complai&s;ance and &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion.
The upper Hou&s;e had been engaged, in the
fir&s;t days of the &s;e&s;&s;ion, to give general thanks for the
King's &s;peech; by which compliment they were under|&s;tood,
according to the practice of that time, to have
acquie&s;ced in every part of it: Yet notwith&s;tanding that
&s;tep, Compton, bi&s;hop of London, in his own name
and that of his brethren, moved that a day &s;hould be
appointed for taking the &s;peech into con&s;ideration: He
was &s;econded by Halifax, Nottingham, and Mordaunt.
<PB N="234" REF="292">
Jefferies, the chancellor, oppo&s;ed this motion; and
&s;eemed inclined to u&s;e in that Hou&s;e the &s;ame arrogance,
to which on the bench he had &s;o long been accu&s;tomed:
But he was &s;oon taught to know his place; and he
proved, by his behaviour, that in&s;olence, when checked,
naturally &s;inks into meanne&s;s and cowardice. The bi|&s;hop
of London's motion prevailed.</P>
<P>THE King might rea&s;onably have pre&s;umed, that
even if the Peers &s;hould &s;o far recover courage as to
make an application again&s;t his di&s;pen&s;ing power, the
&s;ame &s;teddy an&s;wer, which he had given the Commons,
would make them relap&s;e into the &s;ame timidity; and he
might by that means have obtained a very con&s;iderable
&s;upply, without making any conce&s;&s;ions in return. But
&s;o imperious was his temper, &s;o lofty the idea which he
had entertained of his own authority, &s;o violent the
&s;chemes &s;ugge&s;ted by his own bigotry and that of his
prie&s;ts; that, without any delay, without waiting for
any farther provocation, he immediately proceeded to a
prorogation. He continued the Parliament during a
year and a half by four more prorogations; but having
in vain tried by &s;eparate applications to break the ob|&s;tinacy
of the leading members, he at la&s;t di&s;&s;olved that
a&s;&s;embly. And as it was plainly impo&s;&s;ible for him to
find among his prote&s;tant &s;ubjects a &s;et of men more de|voted
to royal authority, it was univer&s;ally concluded,
that he intended thenceforth to govern entirely without
Parliaments.</P>
<P>NEVER King mounted the throne of England with
greater advantages than James; nay, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed greater
facility, if that were any advantage, of rendering him|&s;elf
and his po&s;terity ab&s;olute: But all the&s;e fortunate
circum&s;tances tended only, by his own mi&s;conduct, to
bring more &s;udden ruin upon him. The nation &s;eemed
di&s;po&s;ed of them&s;elves to re&s;ign their liberties into his
hands, had he not, at the &s;ame time, made an attempt
<PB N="235" REF="293">
upon their religion: And he might even have &s;ucceeded
in &s;urmounting at once their liberties and religion, had
he conducted his &s;chemes with common prudence and
di&s;cretion. Openly to declare to the Parliament, &s;o
early in his reign, his intention to di&s;pen&s;e with the te&s;ts,
&s;truck an univer&s;al alarm thro' the nation; infu&s;ed ter|ror
into the church, which had hitherto been the chief
&s;upport of Monarchy; and even di&s;gu&s;ted the army, by
who&s;e means alone he could now propo&s;e to govern.
The former horror again&s;t popery was revived by pole|mical
books and &s;ermons; and in every di&s;pute the
victory &s;eemed to be gained by the prote&s;tant divines,
who were heard with more favourable ears, and who
conducted the controver&s;y with more learning and elo|quence.
But another incident happened at this time,
which tended extremely to excite the animo&s;ity of the
nation again&s;t the catholic communion.</P>
<P>LEWIS the fourteenth, after having long harra&s;&s;ed
and mole&s;ted the Prote&s;tants, at la&s;t revoked entirely the
edict of Nantz; which had been enacted by Harry the
fourth for &s;ecuring them the exerci&s;e of their religion;
which had been declared irrevocable; and which, du|ring
the experience of near a century, had been at|tended
with no &s;en&s;ible inconvenience. All the ini|quities,
in&s;eparable from per&s;ecution, were exerci&s;ed
again&s;t tho&s;e unhappy religioni&s;ts; who became ob&s;ti|nate
in proportion to the oppre&s;&s;ions which they &s;uf|fered,
and either covered under a feigned conver&s;ion a
more violent abhorrence to the catholic communion, or
&s;ought among foreign nations for that liberty, of which
they were bereaved in their native country. Above
half a million of the mo&s;t u&s;eful and indu&s;trious &s;ubjects
de&s;erted France; and exported, together with immen&s;e
&s;ums of money, tho&s;e arts and manufactures, which had
chiefly tended to enrich that kingdom. They propagated
every where the mo&s;t tragical accounts of the tyranny,
<PB N="236" REF="294">
exerci&s;ed again&s;t them, and revived among the Prote|&s;tants
all tho&s;e &s;entiments of the bloody and per&s;ecuting
&s;pirit of popery, to which &s;o many incidents in all ages
had given too much foundation. Near fifty thou&s;and
refugees pa&s;&s;ed over into England; and all men were
di&s;po&s;ed from their repre&s;entations to fo&s;ter the utmo&s;t
horror again&s;t the projects, which they apprehended to
be entertained by the King for the abolition of the pro|te&s;tant
religion. When a Prince of &s;o much humanity
and of &s;uch &s;ignal prudence as Lewis could be engaged,
by the bigotry of his religion alone, without any pro|vocation,
to embrace &s;uch &s;anguinary and impolitic
mea&s;ures; what might be dreaded, they a&s;ked, from
James, who was &s;o much inferior in the&s;e virtues, and
who had already been irritated by &s;uch ob&s;tinate and vio|lent
oppo&s;ition? In vain did the King affect to throw
the highe&s;t blame on the per&s;ecutions of France: In
vain did he afford the mo&s;t real protection and a&s;&s;i&s;tance
to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Hugonots. All the&s;e &s;ymptoms of to|leration
were regarded as fallacious; oppo&s;ite to the
avowed principles of his &s;ect, and belied by the &s;evere
admini&s;tration, which he him&s;elf had exerci&s;ed again&s;t
the Nonconformi&s;ts in Scotland.</P>
<P>THE &s;malle&s;t approach towards the introduction of
popery,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1686.</NOTE> mu&s;t, in the pre&s;ent di&s;po&s;ition of the people,
have afforded rea&s;on of jealou&s;y; much more &s;o wide a
&s;tep as that of di&s;pen&s;ing with the te&s;ts, the &s;ole &s;ecu|rity
which the nation, being di&s;appointed of the exclu|&s;ion-bill,
found provided again&s;t tho&s;e dreaded innova|tions.
Yet was the King re&s;olute to per&s;evere in his
purpo&s;e; and having failed in bringing over the Par|liament,
he made an attempt, with more &s;ucce&s;s, for
e&s;tabli&s;hing the di&s;pen&s;ing power, by a verdict of his
judges. Sir Edward Hales, a new pro&s;elyte, had ac|cepted
a commi&s;&s;ion of colonel; and directions were
<PB N="237" REF="295">
given to his coachman to pro&s;ecute him for the penalty
of five hundred pounds, which the law, e&s;tabli&s;hing
the te&s;ts, had granted to informers. By this feigned
action, the King hoped,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Di&s;pen&s;ing power.</NOTE> both from the authority of the
deci&s;ion, and the rea&s;on of the thing, to put an end to
all que&s;tions with regard to his di&s;pen&s;ing power.</P>
<P>IT could not be expected, that the lawyers, appointed
to plead again&s;t Hales, would exert great force on that
occa&s;ion&punc; But the cau&s;e was regarded with &s;uch anxiety
by the public, that it has been thoroughly di&s;cu&s;&s;ed in &s;e|veral
elaborate di&s;cour&s;es<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Particularly Sir Edward Herbert's defence in the State Trials, and Sir Robert Atkins's Enquiry concerning the di&s;pen&s;ing power.</NOTE>; and could men dive&s;t them|&s;elves
of prejudice, there want not &s;ufficient materials,
on which to form a true judgment. The claim and ex|erci&s;e
of the di&s;pen&s;ing power is allowed to be very an|tient
in England; and tho' it &s;eems at fir&s;t to have been
copied from papal u&s;urpations, it may plainly be traced
up as high as the reign of Henry the third. In the go|thic
governments, men were more anxious to &s;ecure
their private property than to &s;hare in the public admi|ni&s;tration;
and provided no innovations were attempted
on their rights and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, the care of executing the
laws, and en&s;uring general &s;afety was without jealou&s;y
entru&s;ted to the Sovereign. Penal &s;tatutes were com|monly
intended to arm the Prince with more authority
for that purpo&s;e; and being in the main calculated for
promoting his influence and intere&s;t as fir&s;t magi&s;trate,
there &s;eemed no danger in allowing him to di&s;pen&s;e with
their execution, in &s;uch particular ca&s;es as might require
an exception or indulgence. That practice had &s;o much
prevailed, that the Parliament it&s;elf had more than once
acknowleged this prerogative of the Crown; particu|larly
during the reign of Henry the fifth, when they enact|ed
the law again&s;t aliens<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 1. Hen. V. n. xv.</NOTE>, and al&s;o when they pa&s;&s;ed the
&s;tatute of provi&s;ors<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Rot. Parl. 1. Hen. V. n. xxii. It is re|markable, however, that in the reign of Richard the &s;econd, the Parlia|ment granted the King only a temporary power of di&s;pen&s;ing with the &s;ta|tute of provi&s;ors. Rot. Parl. 15.

penal &s;tatutes was &s;uch as gave the King a &s;uperior in|tere&s;t
in their execution beyond any of his &s;ubjects; it
could not but &s;ometimes happen in a mixed government,
that the Parliament would de&s;ire to enact laws, by which
the regal power, in &s;ome particulars, even where pri|vate
property was not immediately concerned, might be
regulated and re&s;trained. In the twenty-third of Henry
the &s;ixth, a law of this kind was enacted, prohibiting
any man to &s;erve in a county as &s;heriff above a year; and
a clau&s;e was in&s;erted, by which the King was di&s;abled
from granting a di&s;pen&s;ation. Plain rea&s;on might have
taught, that this law, at lea&s;t, &s;hould be exempted from
the King's prerogative; But as the di&s;pen&s;ing power &s;till
prevailed in other ca&s;es, it was &s;oon able, aided by the
&s;ervility of the courts of judicature, even to overpower
this &s;tatute, which the legi&s;lature had evidently intended
to &s;ecure again&s;t all violation. In the reign of Henry the
&s;eventh, the ca&s;e was brought to a trial before all the
judges in the Exchequer-chamber; and it was decreed,
that, notwith&s;tanding the &s;trict clau&s;e abovementioned,
the King might di&s;pen&s;e with the &s;tatute: He could
fir&s;t, it was alleged, di&s;pen&s;e with the prohibitory clau&s;e,
and then with the &s;tatute it&s;elf. This opinion of the
judges, however ab&s;urd, had ever &s;ince pa&s;&s;ed for un|doubted
law: The practice of continuing the &s;heriffs had
ever prevailed: And mo&s;t of the property in England had
been fixed by deci&s;ions, which juries, returned by &s;uch
&s;heriffs, had given in the courts of judicature. Many other
di&s;pen&s;ations of a like nature may be produced; not only
&s;uch as took place by intervals, but &s;uch as were uniformly
continued. Thus the law was di&s;pen&s;ed with which prohi|bited
any man to go a judge of a&s;&s;ize into his own county;
that which rendered all Welchmen incapable of offices in
<PB N="239" REF="299">
Wales; that which required every one, who received a
pardon for felony, to find &s;ureties for his good behavi|our.
In the &s;econd of James the fir&s;t, a new con&s;ulta|tion
of all the judges had been held in the Exchequer-chamber
upon a like que&s;tion: This prerogative of the
Crown was again unanimou&s;ly confirmed<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Coke's Reports, &s;eventh report.</NOTE>: And it be|came
an e&s;tabli&s;hed principle in Engli&s;h juri&s;prudence,
that, tho' the King could not allow of what was morally
unlawful, he could permit what was only prohibited by
po&s;itive &s;tatute. Even the jealous Hou&s;e of Commons,
which extorted the petition of right from Charles the
fir&s;t, made no &s;cruple, by the mouth of Glanville, their
manager, to allow of the di&s;pen&s;ing power in its full ex|tent<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. vii. fir&s;t edit. p. 205. Parl. Hi&s;t. vol. viii. p. 132.</NOTE>; and in the famous trial of &s;hip-money, Holborne,
the popular lawyer, had, freely, and in the mo&s;t ex|pre&s;s
terms, made the &s;ame conce&s;&s;ion<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">State Trials, vol. v. fir&s;t edit. p. 171.</NOTE>. Sir Edward
Coke, the great oracle of Engli&s;h law, had not only
concurred with all other lawyers in favour of this prero|gative;
but &s;eems even to believe it &s;o inherent in the
Crown, that an act of Parliament it&s;elf could not abo|li&s;h it<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Sir Edward Coke's Reports, twelfth report, p. 18.</NOTE>. And he particularly ob&s;erves, that no law can
impo&s;e &s;uch a di&s;ability of enjoying offices as the King
may not di&s;pen&s;e with; becau&s;e the King, from the law
of nature, has a right to the &s;ervice of all his &s;ubjects.
This particular rea&s;on, as well as all the general princi|ples,
is applicable to the que&s;tion of the te&s;ts; nor can
the dangerous con&s;equence of granting di&s;pen&s;ations in
that ca&s;e be ever received before a court of judicature.
Every prerogative of the Crown, it may be &s;aid, admits
of abu&s;e: Should the King pardon all criminals, law
mu&s;t be totally di&s;&s;olved: Should he declare and continue
perpetual war again&s;t all nations, inevitable ruin mu&s;t

en&s;ue: Yet the&s;e powers are entru&s;ted to the Sovereign;
and we mu&s;t be contented, as our ance&s;tors were, to
depend upon his prudence and di&s;cretion in the exerci&s;e
of them.</P>
<P>THO' this rea&s;oning &s;eems founded on &s;uch principles
as are u&s;ually admitted by lawyers, the people had en|tertained
&s;uch violent prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions again&s;t the u&s;e, which
James here made of his prerogative, that he was ob|liged,
before he brought on Hales's cau&s;e, to di&s;place four
of the judges, Jones, Montague, Charleton and Nevil;
and even Sir Edward Herbert, the chief ju&s;tice, tho' a
man of acknowleged virtue, yet becau&s;e he here &s;up|ported
the preten&s;ions of the Crown, fell under a great
load of infamy. Men deemed a di&s;pen&s;ing, to be in ef|fect
the &s;ame with a repealing power; and they could
not conceive, that le&s;s authority was requi&s;ite to repeal
than to enact any &s;tatute. If one penal law was di&s;|pen&s;ed
with, any other might undergo the &s;ame fate:
And by what principle could even the laws, which de|fine
property, be afterwards &s;ecured from violation? The
te&s;t act had ever been conceived the great barrier of the
e&s;tabli&s;hed religion under a popi&s;h &s;ucce&s;&s;or: As &s;uch it
had been in&s;i&s;ted on by the Parliament; as &s;uch granted
by the King; as &s;uch, during the debates with regard to
the exclu&s;ion, recommended by the chancellor. By
what magic, what chicane of law, is it now annihilated,
and rendered of no validity? The&s;e que&s;tions were every
where a&s;ked; and men, &s;traitened by precedents and de|ci&s;ions
of great authority, were reduced either to que&s;tion
the antiquity of this prerogative it&s;elf, or to a&s;&s;ert, that
even the practice of near five centuries could not be|&s;tow
on it &s;ufficient authority<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Sir Robert Atkins, p. 21.</NOTE>. It was not con&s;idered
that the pre&s;ent difficulty or &s;eeming ab&s;urdity had pro|ceeded
from late innovations introduced into the go|vernment.
Ever &s;ince the beginning of this century, the
<PB N="241" REF="303">
Parliament had, with the mo&s;t laudable zeal, been ac|quiring
powers and e&s;tabli&s;hing principles, favourable to
law and liberty: The authority of the Crown had been
limited in many important particulars: And penal &s;tatutes
were often calculated to &s;ecure the con&s;titution
again&s;t the attempts of mini&s;ters, as well as to pre&s;erve
general peace and repre&s;s crimes and immoralities. A
prerogative however, derived from very antient, and al|mo&s;t
uniform practice, the di&s;pen&s;ing power, &s;till re|mained,
or was &s;uppo&s;ed to remain with the Crown;
&s;ufficient in an in&s;tant to overturn this whole fabric,
and to throw down all the fences of the con&s;titution. If
this prerogative; which carries, on the face of it, &s;uch
&s;trong &s;ymptoms of an ab&s;olute authority in the Crown,
had yet, in antient times, &s;ub&s;i&s;ted with &s;ome degree of
liberty in the &s;ubject; this fact only proves, that &s;carce
any human government, much le&s;s one erected in rude
and barbarous times, is entirely con&s;i&s;tent and uniform
in all its parts. But to expect, that the di&s;pen&s;ing power
could, in any degree, be rendered compatible with tho&s;e
accurate and regular limitations; which had of late been
e&s;tabli&s;hed, and which the people were determined to
maintain, was a vain hope; and tho' men knew not
upon what principles they could deny that prerogative,
they &s;aw, that, if they would pre&s;erve their laws and
con&s;titution, there was an ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity for denying,
or at lea&s;t for aboli&s;hing it. The revolution alone, which
&s;oon &s;ucceeded, happily put an end to all the&s;e di&s;putes:
By means of it a more uniform edifice was at la&s;t erected:
The mon&s;trous incon&s;i&s;tence, &s;o vi&s;ible between the an|tient
Gothic parts of the fabric and the recent plans of
liberty, was fully corrected: And to their mutual felicity,
King and people were finally taught to know their pro|per
limits and boundaries<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">It is remarkable, that the Convention, &s;ummoned by the Prince of Orange, did not, even when they had the making of their own terms in <HI>the Declaration of Rights,</HI> venture to condemn the di&s;pen&s;ing power in ge|neral, which had been uniformly exerci&s;ed by the former Kings of England. They only condemned it &s;o far, <HI>at it had been a&s;&s;umed and exerci&s;ed of late.</HI> But in the <HI>Bill of Rights,</HI> which pa&s;&s;ed about a twelvemonth after, the Parliament took care to &s;ecure them&s;elves more effectually again&s;t a branch of prerogative, incompatible with all legal liberty and limitations; and they excluded, in po&s;itive terms, all di&s;pen&s;ing power in the Crown. Yet even then the Hou&s;e of Lords rejected that clau&s;e of the bill, which condemned the exerci&s;e of this power in former kings, and obliged the Commons to re&s;t contented with aboli&s;hing it for the future. There needs no other proof of the irregular nature of the old Engli&s;h government, than the &s;ub|&s;i&s;tence of &s;uch a prerogative, always exerci&s;ed and never que&s;tioned, till the acqui&s;ition of real liberty di&s;covered, at la&s;t, the danger of it.

WHATEVER topics lawyers might find to defend
James's di&s;pen&s;ing power, the nation thought it dange|rous,
if not fatal, to liberty; and his re&s;olution of ex|erci&s;ing
it may on that account be e&s;teemed equally
alarming, as if the power had been founded on the mo&s;t
recent and mo&s;t flagrant u&s;urpation. It was hot likely,
that an authority, which had been a&s;&s;umed thro' &s;o many
ob&s;tacles, would in his hands lie long idle and unem|ployed.
Four catholic lords were brought into the privy
council, Powis, Arundel, Bella&s;is, and Dover. Hali|fax,
finding, that notwith&s;tanding all his pa&s;t merits,
he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed no real credit or authority, became very re|fractory
in his oppo&s;ition; and his office of privy &s;eal
was given to Arundel. The King was open, as well
as zealous, in the de&s;ire of making converts; and men
plainly &s;aw, that the only way to acquire his affection
and confidence was by a &s;acrifice of their religion. Sun|derland,
&s;ome time after, &s;crupled not to gain favour at
this price. Roche&s;ter, the trea&s;urer, tho' the King's
brother-in-law, yet, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to give this in|&s;tance
of complai&s;ance, was turned out of his office:
The Trea&s;ury was put in commi&s;&s;ion, and Bella&s;is was
placed at the head of it. All the courtiers were di&s;|gu&s;ted,
even &s;uch as had little regard to religion. The
<PB N="243" REF="307">
di&s;honour, as well as di&s;tru&s;t, attending renegades, made
mo&s;t men re&s;olve, at all hazards, to adhere to their an|tient
faith.</P>
<P>IN SCOTLAND,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Scotland.</NOTE> James's zeal for pro&s;elyti&s;m was more
&s;ucce&s;sful. The earls of Murray, Perth, and Melfort
were brought over to the Court religion; and the two
latter noblemen made u&s;e of a very courtly rea&s;on for
their conversion: They pretended, that the papers, found
in the late King's cabinet, had opened their eyes, and
had convinced them, of the preference due to the Catho|lic
religion. Queen&s;berry, who di&s;covered not the &s;ame
complai&s;ance, fell into total di&s;grace, notwith&s;tanding
his former &s;ervices, and the unlimited &s;acrifices, which
he had made to the mea&s;ures of the Court. The&s;e
merits could not even en&s;ure him of &s;afety again&s;t the
vengeance, to which he &s;tood expo&s;ed. His rival, Perth,
who had been ready to &s;ink under his &s;uperior intere&s;t,
now acquired the a&s;cendant; and all the complaints,
exhibited again&s;t him, were totally obliterated. His faith,
according to a &s;aying of Halifax, had made him whole.</P>
<P>BUT it was in Ireland chiefly,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Ireland.</NOTE> that the ma&s;k was wholly
taken off; and that the King thought him&s;elf at liberty
to proceed to the full extent of his zeal, and his vio|lence.
The duke of Ormond was recalled; and tho'
the primate and lord Granard, two prote&s;tants, &s;till po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
the authority of ju&s;tices, the whole power was
lodged in the hands of Talbot, the general, &s;oon efter
created earl of Tyrconnel; a man, who, from the blind|ne&s;s
of his prejudices and fury of his temper, was tran&s;|ported
with the mo&s;t immea&s;urable ardour for the Ca|tholic
cau&s;e. After the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of Monmouth's re|bellion,
orders were given by Tyrconnel to di&s;arm all
the prote&s;tants, on pretence of &s;ecuring the public peace,
and keeping their arms in a few magazines for the u&s;e of
the militia. Next, the army was new-modelled; and
great numbers of officers were di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, becau&s;e it was
<PB N="244" REF="308">
pretended, that they or their fathers had &s;erved under
Cromwel and the Republic. The injustice was not
confined to them. Near three hundred officers more
were afterwards broke, tho' many of them had pur|cha&s;ed
their commi&s;&s;ions: About four or five thou&s;and
private &s;oldiers, because they were Prote&s;tants, were di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed;
and being &s;tripped even of their regimentals,
were turned out to &s;tarve in the &s;treets. While the&s;e
violences were carrying on, Clarendon, who had been
named lord lieutenant, came over; but he quickly found,
that, as he had refu&s;ed to give the King the de&s;ired
pledge of fidelity, by changing his religion, he po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
no credit or authority. He was even a kind of
pri&s;oner in the hands of Tyrconnel; and as he gave all
oppo&s;ition in. his power to the precipitant mea&s;ures of
the Catholics, he was &s;oon after recalled, and Tyr|connel
&s;ub&s;tituted in his place. The unhappy Prote|&s;tants
now &s;aw all the legal authority, as well as the
military force, transferred into the hands of their in|veterate
enemies; inflamed with hereditary hatred, and
&s;timulated by every motive, which either the pa&s;&s;ion for
power, property, or religion could in&s;pire. Even the
barbarous banditti were let loo&s;e to prey on them in their
pre&s;ent defencele&s;s condition. A renewal of the antient
ma&s;&s;acres was apprehended; and great multitudes, &s;truck
with the be&s;t grounded terror, de&s;erted the kingdom,
and infu&s;ed into the Engli&s;h nation a dread of tho&s;e
violences, to which, after &s;ome time, they might ju&s;tly,
from the prevalence of the Catholics, think them&s;elves
expo&s;ed.</P>
<P>ALL judicious per&s;ons of the Catholic communion were
di&s;gu&s;ted with the&s;e violent mea&s;ures, and could ea&s;ily
fore&s;ee the con&s;equences. But James was entirely go|verned
by the ra&s;h coun&s;els of the Queen and of his
confe&s;&s;or, father Peters, a je&s;uit, whom he &s;oon after
created a privy coun&s;ellor. He thought too that as he
<PB N="245" REF="309">
was now in the decline of life, it was nece&s;&s;ary for him, by
ha&s;ty &s;teps, to carry his de&s;igns into execution; le&s;t the
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the prince&s;s of Orange &s;hould overturn all
his projects. In vain did Arundel, Powis, and Bella&s;is
remon&s;trate, and &s;ugge&s;t more moderate and cautious
mea&s;ures. The&s;e men had &s;een and felt, during the
pro&s;ecution of the plot, the extreme antipathy which the
nation bore to popery; and though &s;ome &s;ub&s;equent in|cidents
had &s;eemingly allayed that &s;pirit, they knew, that
the &s;ettled habits of the people were &s;till the &s;ame, and
that the &s;malle&s;t incident was &s;ufficient to renew the fo|rmer
animo&s;ity. A very moderate indulgence therefore to
their religion would have &s;atisfied them; and all attempts
to acquire power, much more to procure a change of the
national faith, they deemed dangerous and de&s;tructive.</P>
<P>ON the fir&s;t broaching of the popi&s;h plot,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Breach be|twixt the King and the church.</NOTE> the Church
of England had concurred with the &s;ame violence and
credulity as the re&s;t of the nation, in the pro&s;ecution of
it; But dreading afterwards the prevalence of republican
and pre&s;byterian principles, they had been engaged to
&s;upport the mea&s;ures of the court; and to their a&s;&s;i&s;tance
James had chiefly owed his &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown.
Finding that all the&s;e &s;ervices were forgot, and that the
Catholic religion was the King's &s;ole darling, the church
had commenced an oppo&s;ition to court-mea&s;ures; and
popery was now acknowledged the more immediate danger.
In order to prevent inflammatory &s;ermons on this popu|lar
&s;ubject, James revived &s;ome directions to preachers
which had been promulgated by the late King, in the
beginning of his reign, when no de&s;ign again&s;t the na|tional
religion was yet formed, or at lea&s;t apprehended.
But in the pre&s;ent delicate and intere&s;ting &s;ituation of the
church, there was little rea&s;on to expect, that orders,
founded on no legal authority, would be rigidly obeyed
by preachers, who &s;aw no &s;ecurity to them&s;elves but in
pre&s;erving the confidence and regard of the people. In|&s;tead
<PB N="246" REF="310">
of avoiding controver&s;y, according to the King's ad|monition,
the preachers every where declaimed again&s;t
popery; and among the re&s;t, Dr. Sharpe, a clergyman
of London, particularly di&s;tingui&s;hed him&s;elf, and af|fected
to throw great contempt on tho&s;e who had been
induced to change their religion by &s;uch pitiful argu|ments
as the Romi&s;h mi&s;&s;ionaries could &s;ugge&s;t. This
topic, being &s;uppo&s;ed to rcflect on the King, gave great
offence at court; and positive orders were i&s;&s;ued to the
bi&s;hop of London, his dioce&s;an, immediately to &s;u&s;pend
Sharpe, till his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure &s;hould be farther
known. The prelate replied, that he could not po&s;&s;ibly
obey the&s;e commands, and that he was not empowered,
in &s;uch a &s;ummary manner, to inflict any puni&s;hment
even upon the greate&s;t delinquent. But neither the&s;e
obvious rea&s;ons, nor the mo&s;t dutiful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ions, both
of the prelate and of Sharpe him&s;elf, could appea&s;e the
court. The King was determined to proceed with the
utmo&s;t violence in this cau&s;e. The bi&s;hop him&s;elf he re|&s;olved
to puni&s;h for di&s;obedience to his commands; and
the expedient which he employed for that purpo&s;e, was
of a nature at once the mo&s;t illegal and mo&s;t alarming.</P>
<P>AMONG all the engines of authority formerly employed
by the Crown, none had been more dangerous or even
de&s;tructive to liberty, than the court of high com|mi&s;&s;ion,
which, together with the &s;tar-chamber, had
been aboli&s;hed in the reign of Charles I. by act of Parlia|ment;
in which a clau&s;e was al&s;o inserted, prohibiting
the erection, in all future times, of that court or any of
a like nature. But the law was deemed by James no
ob&s;tacle;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Court of ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion.</NOTE> and an eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion, was anew i&s;|&s;ued,
by which &s;even<NOTE N="m" PLACE="foot">The per&s;ons named were the archbi&s;hop of Canterbury, Sancroft; the bi&s;hop of Durham, Crew; of Roche&s;ter, Sprat; the earl of Roche&s;ter Sunderland, chancellor Jefferies, and lord chief ju&s;tice Herbert. The archbi&s;hop refu&s;ed to act, and the bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter was &s;ub&s;tituted in $word$ place.</NOTE> commi&s;&s;ioners were ve&s;ted with
<PB N="247" REF="311">
full and unlimited authority over the whole church of
England. On this court were be&s;towed the &s;ame inqui|&s;itorial
powers, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the former court of high
commi&s;&s;ion: They might proceed upon bare &s;u&s;picion;
and the better to &s;et the law at defiance, it was expre&s;sly
in&s;erted in their patent it&s;elf, that they were to exerci&s;e
their juri&s;diction, notwith&s;tanding any law or &s;tatute to
the contrary. The King's de&s;ign to &s;ubdue the church
was now &s;ufficiently known; and had he been able to
e&s;tabli&s;h the authority of this new-erected court, his &s;uc|ce&s;s
was infallible. A more &s;en&s;ible blow could not be
given both to national liberty and religion; and happily
the conte&s;t could not be tried in a cau&s;e more iniquitous
and unpopular than that again&s;t Sharpe and the bi&s;hop of
London.</P>
<P>THE prelate was cited before the commi&s;&s;ioners. After
denying the legality of the court, after claiming the privi|lege
of all Chri&s;tian bi&s;hops to be tried by the metro|politan
and his &s;uffragans; he pleaded in his own defence,
that as he was obliged, if he had &s;u&s;pended Sharpe, to act
in the capacity of a judge, he could not, con&s;i&s;tent either
With law or ju&s;tice, pronounce &s;entence without a pre|vious
citation and trial: That he had by petition repre|&s;ented
this difficulty to his Maje&s;ty; and not receiving any
an&s;wer, he had rea&s;on to think, that his petition had
given entire &s;atisfaction. That in order to &s;hew his far|ther
deference, he had advi&s;ed Sharpe to preach no more,
till he had ju&s;tified his conduct to the King; an advice,
which, coming from a &s;uperior, was equivalent to a com|mand,
and had accordingly met with the proper obedi|ence:
That he had thus in his apprehen&s;ion conformed
him&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty's plea&s;ure; but if he &s;hould &s;till be
found wanting to his duty in any particular, he was now
contented to crave pardon,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sentence again&s;t the bi&s;hop of London.</NOTE> and to make reparation. All
this &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. both in Sharpe and the prelate, had no
effect; The King was determined to have an example:
<PB N="248" REF="312">
Orders were accordingly &s;ent to the commi&s;&s;ioners to
proceed:<NOTE PLACE="marg">1687.</NOTE> And by a majority of votes the bi&s;hop, as well
as the doctor, was &s;u&s;pended.</P>
<P>ALMOST the whole of this &s;hort reign con&s;i&s;ts of at|tempts
always imprudent, often illegal, and &s;ometimes
both, again&s;t whatever was mo&s;t loved and revered by
the nation: Even &s;uch &s;chemes of the King's as might
be laudable in them&s;elves, were &s;o di&s;graced with the&s;e
intentions, that they &s;erve only to aggravate the charge
again&s;t him. James was become a great patron of tol|eration,
and an enemy to all tho&s;e per&s;ecuting laws, which,
from the influence of the church, had been enacted both
again&s;t the Di&s;&s;enters and Catholics.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Penal laws &s;u&s;pended.</NOTE> Not contented
with granting di&s;pen&s;ations, to particular per&s;ons he a&s;|&s;umed
a power of i&s;&s;uing a declaration of general indul|gence,
and of &s;u&s;pending at once all the penal &s;tatutes,
by which a conformity was required to the e&s;tabli&s;hed re|ligion.
This was a &s;train of authority, it mu&s;t be con|fe&s;&s;ed,
quite incon&s;i&s;tent with law and a limited con|&s;titution;
but was &s;upported by many &s;trong precedents
in the hi&s;tory of England. Even after the principles of
liberty were become more prevalent, and began to be
well under&s;tood, the late King had oftner than once,
and without giving much umbrage, exerted this dange|rous
power: He had in 1662 &s;u&s;pended the execution of
a law, which regulated carriages: During the two
Dutch wars, he had twice &s;u&s;pended the act of navi|gation:
And the Commons in 1666, being re&s;olved,
contrary to the King's judgment, to enact that iniquitous
law again&s;t Iri&s;h cattle, found it nece&s;&s;ary, in order to
obviate the exerci&s;e of this prerogative, which they de|&s;ired
not at that time entirely to deny or abrogate, to
call the importation of that cattle a nui&s;ance.</P>
<P>THO' the former authority of the King was great in
civil affairs, it was &s;till greater in eccle&s;ia&s;tical; and the
whole de&s;potic power: of the popes was often, believed, in
<PB N="249" REF="313">
virtue of the &s;upremacy, to be devolved to the crown.
The la&s;t parliament of Charles the fir&s;t, by depriving the
King and convocation of the power of framing canons
without con&s;ent of Parliament, had &s;omewhat dimini&s;hed
the &s;uppo&s;ed extent of the &s;upremacy; but &s;till very con|&s;iderable
remains of it, at lea&s;t very important claims,
were pre&s;erved, and were occa&s;ionally made u&s;e of by the
Sovereign. In 1662, Charles, pleading both the rights
of his &s;upremacy and his &s;u&s;pending power, had granted
a general indulgence or toleration; and in 1672 he re|newed
the &s;ame edict: Tho' the remon&s;tran$$ of his
Parliament obliged him, on both occa&s;ions, to retract;
and in the la&s;t in&s;tance, the triumph of law over prero|gative
was deemed very great and memorable. In general,
we may remark, where the exerci&s;e of the &s;u&s;pending
power was agreeable and u&s;eful, the power it&s;elf was
little que&s;tioned: Where the exerci&s;e was thought liable
to exceptions, men not only oppo&s;ed it, but proceeded
to deny altogether the legality of the prerogative on
which it was founded.</P>
<P>JAMES, much more imprudent, head-&s;trong, and ar|bitrary
than his brother, i&s;&s;ued anew a proclamation,
&s;u&s;pending all the penal laws in eccle&s;ia&s;tical affairs, and
granting a general liberty of con&s;cience to all his &s;ubjects.
He was not deterred by the con&s;ideration, that this
&s;cheme of indulgence was already bla&s;ted by two fruit|le&s;s
attempts; and that in &s;uch a government as that of
England, it was not &s;ufficient that a prerogative be ap|proved
of by &s;ome lawyers and antiquarians: If it was
condemned by the general voice of the nation, and yet
was &s;till exerted, the victory over national liberty was
equally &s;ignal as if obtained by the mo&s;t flagrant inju&s;tice
and u&s;urpation. The&s;e two con&s;iderations indeed would
rather &s;erve to recommend this project to James; who
deemed him&s;elf &s;uperior in vigour and activity to his
brother, and who probably thought, that his people en|joyed
<PB N="250" REF="314">
no liberties, but by his royal conce&s;&s;ion and indul|gence.</P>
<P>IN order to procure a better reception for his edict of
toleration, the King, finding him&s;elf oppo&s;ed by the
church, began to pay great court to the Di&s;&s;enters; and
he imagined, that, by playing one party again&s;t another,
he would ea&s;ily obtain the victory over both; a refined
policy which it much exceeded his capacity to conduct.
His intention was &s;o obvious, that it was impo&s;&s;ible for
him ever to gain the &s;incere confidence and regard of the
Nonconformi&s;ts. They knew, that the genius of their
religion was diametrically oppo&s;ite to that of the Catho|lics,
the &s;ole object of the King's affection. They were
&s;en&s;ible, that both the violence of his temper, and the
maxims of his religion, were repugnant to the principles
of toleration. They had &s;een, that on his fir&s;t acce&s;&s;ion
to the Crown, as well as during his brother's reign, he
had courted the church at their expence; and it was
not till after his dangerous &s;chemes were rejected by the
prelates, that he had recour&s;e to the Nonconformi&s;ts.
All his favours, therefore, mu&s;t, to every man of judg|ment
among the &s;ectaries, have appeared mo&s;t in&s;idious:
Yet &s;uch was the plea&s;ure reaped from pre&s;ent ea&s;e, &s;uch
the animosity of the di&s;&s;enters again&s;t the church, who
had &s;o long &s;ubjected them to the rigours of per&s;ecution,
that they every where expre&s;&s;ed the mo&s;t entire duty to
the King and compliance with his mea&s;ures; and could
not forbear rejoicing extremely in the pre&s;ent depre&s;&s;ion
of their enemies.</P>
<P>BUT had the Di&s;&s;enters been ever &s;o much inclined to
&s;hut their eyes with regard to the King's intentions, the
manner of conducting his &s;cheme in Scotland was &s;uffi|cient
to di&s;cover the &s;ecret. The King fir&s;t applied to the
Scots Parliament, and de&s;ired an indulgence for the Ca|tholics
alone, without comprehending the Pre&s;byterians:
But that a&s;&s;embly, though more di&s;po&s;ed than even the
<PB N="251" REF="315">
Parliament of England, to &s;acrifice their civil liberties,
re&s;olved likewi&s;e to adhere pertinaciou&s;ly to their religion;
and they now rejected for the fir&s;t time the King's ap|plication.
James therefore found him&s;elf obliged to ex|ert
his prerogative; and he thought it prudent to intere&s;t
a party of his &s;ubjects, be&s;ides the Catholics, in &s;up|porting
this act of authority. To the great &s;urprize of
the harra&s;&s;ed and per&s;ecuted Pre&s;byterians, they heard the
principles of toleration every where extolled, and found
that permi&s;&s;ion was granted to attend conventicles; an
offence, which, even during this reign, had been de|clared
no le&s;s than a capital crime. The King's decla|ration,
however, of indulgence contained articles, &s;ufficient
to depre&s;s their joy. As if Popery were already
predominant, he declared, that he never would u&s;e
force or <HI>invincible nece&s;&s;ity</HI> again&s;t any man on account
of his per&s;wa&s;ion or the prote&s;tant religion;&endq; A pro|mi&s;e
&s;urely of toleration given to the Prote&s;tants with
great precaution, and admitting a considerable latitude
for per&s;ecution and violence. It is likewi&s;e remarkable,
that the King declared in expre&s;s terms, that he had
thought fit, by his &s;overeign authority, prerogative
royal, and <HI>ab&s;olute</HI> power, which all his &s;ubjects were
to obey <HI>without re&s;erve,</HI> to grant this royal toleration.&endq;
The dangerous de&s;igns of other Princes are to be col|lected
by a compari&s;on of their &s;everal actions, by a di&s;|covery
of their more &s;ecret councils: But &s;o blinded
was James with zeal, &s;o tran&s;ported with his imperious
temper, that even his proclamations and public edicts
contain expre&s;&s;ions, which, without any farther enquiry,
may &s;uffice to his condemnation.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h well knew, that the King, by the con|&s;titution
of their government, thought him&s;elf intitled,
as indeed he was, to as ample authority in his &s;outhern,
as in his northern kingdom; and therefore, tho' the de|claration
of indulgence publi&s;hed for England was more
<PB N="250" REF="316">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="251" REF="317">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="252" REF="318">
cautiou&s;ly worded, they could not but be alarmed by
the arbitrary treatment, to which their neighbours were
expo&s;ed. I is even remarkable, that the Engli&s;h de|claration
contained clau&s;es of a &s;trange import. The
King there promi&s;ed, that he would maintain his loving
&s;ubjects in all their properties and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, as well of
church and abbey lands as of any other. Men
thought, that, if the full e&s;tabli&s;hment of popery was
not at hand, this promi&s;e was quite &s;uperfluous; and
they concluded, that the King was &s;o replete with joy
on the pro&s;pect of that glorious event, that he could not,
even for a moment, refrain him&s;elf from expre&s;&s;ing it.</P>
<P>But what afforded the mo&s;t alarming pro&s;pect,<NOTE PLACE="marg">State of Iceland.</NOTE> was
the violent, and precipitant conduct of affairs in Ireland.
Tyrconnel was now ve&s;ted with full authority; and car|ried
over with him as chancellor one Fitton, a man who
was taken from a jail, and who had been convicted of
forgery and other crimes, but who compen&s;ated for all
his enormities by a headlong zeal for the Catholic reli|gion.
He was even heard to &s;ay from the bench, that
the Prote&s;tants were all rogues, and that there was not
one among forty thou&s;and who was not a traitor, a re|bel,
and a villain. The whole &s;train of the admini&s;tra|tion
was &s;uitable to &s;uch &s;entiments. The Catholics
were put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the council table, of the courts
of judicature, of the bench of ju&s;tices. In order to
make them ma&s;ters of the Parliament, the &s;ame violence
was exerci&s;ed that had been practi&s;ed in England. The
charters of Dublin and of all the corporations were re|called;
and new charters were granted, &s;ubjecting the
corporations to the ab&s;olute will of the Sovereign. The
Prote&s;tant freemen were expelled, Catholics introduced,
and the latter &s;ect, as they always were the majority in
number, were now inve&s;ted with the whole power of
the kingdom. The act of &s;ettlement was the only ob|&s;tacle
to their enjoying the whole property; and Tyr|connel
<PB N="253" REF="319">
had formed a &s;cheme for calling a Parliament, in
order to rever&s;e that act, and empower the King to be|&s;tow
all the lands of Ireland on his catholic &s;ubjects.
But in this &s;cheme he met with oppo&s;ition from the mo|derate
Catholics in the King's council. Lord Bella&s;is
went even &s;o far as to affirm with an oath, &startq;that that fel|low
in Ireland was fool and madam enough to ruin ten
kingdoms.&endq; The decay of trade, from the de&s;ertion
of the Prote&s;tants, was repre&s;ented; the &s;inking of the
tevenue; the alarm communicated to England: And by
the&s;e con&s;iderations the King's re&s;olutions were for &s;ome
time &s;u&s;pended; tho' it was ea&s;y to fore&s;ee, from the
u&s;ual tenor of his conduct, which &s;ide would at la&s;t pre|ponderate.</P>
<P>BUT the King was not contented with di&s;covering in
his own kingdoms the imprudence of his conduct: He
was re&s;olved, that all Europe &s;hould be witne&s;s of it.
He publickly &s;ent the earl of Ca&s;telmaine amba&s;&s;ador ex|traordinary
to Rome,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Emba&s;&s;y to Rome.</NOTE> in order to expre&s;s his obei&s;ance to
the Pope, and to reconcile his kingdoms to the catholic
communion. Never man, who came on &s;o important
an errand, met with &s;o many neglects and even affronts,
as Ca&s;telmaine; The Pope, in&s;tead of being plea&s;ed
with this forward &s;tep, concluded, that a &s;cheme, con|ducted
with &s;uch indi&s;cretion, could never po&s;&s;ibly be
&s;ucce&s;sful. And as he was engaged in a violent quarrel
with the French monarch, a quarrel which intere&s;ted
him much more than the conver&s;ion of England, he bore
little regard to James, whom he believed too clo&s;ely
united with his capital enemy.</P>
<P>THE only proof of complai&s;ance, which the King re|ceived
from his Holine&s;s, was his &s;ending a nuncio into
England, in return for the emba&s;&s;y. By act of Parlia|ment
any communication with the Pope was declared
high trea&s;on: Yet &s;o little regard did the King pay to the
laws, that he gave the nuncio a public and &s;olemn re|ception
<PB N="254" REF="320">
at Wind&s;or. The duke of Somer&s;et, one of the
lords of the bed-chamber, becau&s;e he refu&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t at
this ceremony, was di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his employments.
The nuncio re&s;ided openly in London during all this
reign. Four catholic bi&s;hops were publickly con&s;ecrated
in the King's chapel, and &s;ent out, under the title of
vicars apo&s;tolical, to exerci&s;e the epi&s;copal function in
their re&s;pective dioce&s;es. Their pa&s;toral letters, directed
to the lay Catholics of England, were printed and di&s;|per&s;ed
by the expre&s;s allowance and permi&s;&s;ion of the
King. The regular clergy of that communion appeared
at Court in the habits of their order; and &s;ome of them
were &s;o indi&s;creet as to boa&s;t, that, in a little time, they
hoped to walk in proce&s;&s;ion thro' the capital.</P>
<P>WHILE the King &s;hocked in the mo&s;t open manner
all the principles and prejudices of his prote&s;tant &s;ub|jects,
he could not &s;ometimes but be &s;en&s;ible, that he
&s;tood in need of their a&s;&s;i&s;tance for the execution of his
de&s;igns. He had him&s;elf, by virtue of his prerogative,
&s;u&s;pended the penal laws, and di&s;pen&s;ed with the te&s;t;
but he would gladly have obtained the &s;anction of Par|liament
to the&s;e acts of power and he knew, that,
without this authority, his edicts alone would never af|ford
&s;ufficient &s;ecurity to the Catholics. He had em|ployed,
therefore, with the members of Parliament
many private conferences, which were then called <HI>clo|&s;etings;</HI>
and he u&s;ed every expedient of rea&s;ons, menaces,
and promi&s;es to break their ob&s;tinacy in this particular.
Finding all his efforts fruitle&s;s, he had di&s;&s;olved the Par|liament,
and was re&s;olved to call a new one, from whom he
expected more complai&s;ance and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion. By the
practice of annuling the charters, the King was become
ma&s;ter of all the corporations, and could at his plea&s;ure
change every where the whole magistracy. The church
party, therefore, by whom the Crown had been hitherto
&s;o remarkably &s;upported, and to whom the King vi&s;ibly
<PB N="255" REF="321">
owed his own &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, were deprived of all authority;
and Di&s;&s;enters fir&s;t in London, and afterwards in every
other town, were &s;ub&s;tituted in their place. Not con|tented
with this violent and dangerous innovation, cer|tain
regulators were appointed to examine the qualifica|tions
of electors; and directions were given them to ex|clued
all &s;uch as adhered to the te&s;t and penal &s;tatutes<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">The elections in &s;ome places, particularly in York, were transferred from the people to the magi&s;trates, who, by the new charter, were all named by the Crown. Sir John Rere&s;by's Memoirs, p. 272. This was in reality nothing different from the King's naming the members. The &s;ame act of authority had been employed in all the burroughs of Scot|land.</NOTE>.
Queries to this purpo&s;e were openly propo&s;ed in all pla|ces,
in order to try the &s;entiments of men, and enable
the King to judge of the proceedings of the future Par|liament.
The power of the Crown was at this time &s;o
great; the revenue, managed by James's frugality, &s;o
con&s;iderable and independant; that if he had embraced
any national party, he had been en&s;ured of infallible
&s;ucce&s;s, and might have carried his authority to what
extent he plea&s;ed. But the Catholics, to whom he had
entirely devoted him&s;elf, were not the hundredth part of
the people. Even the prote&s;tant Nonconformi&s;ts, whom
he &s;o much courted, were litttle more than the twen|tieth;
and what Was wor&s;e, repo&s;ed very little confidence
in the unnatural alliance contracted with the Catholics,
and in the principles of toleration, which, contrary to
their u&s;ual practice in all ages, &s;eemed at pre&s;ent to be
adopted by that &s;ect. The King therefore, findnig little
hopes of &s;ucce&s;s, protracted the election of a Parliament,
and proceeded &s;till in the exerci&s;e of his illegal and arbi|trary
authority.</P>
<P>THE whole power in Ireland had been committed to
the Catholics. In Scotland, all the mini&s;ters, whom
the King chiefly tru&s;ted, were converts to that religion.
Every great office in England, civil and military, was
<PB N="256" REF="322">
gradually transferred from the Prote&s;tants. Roche&s;ter
and Clarendon, the King's brothers-in-law, tho' they
had been ever faithful to his intere&s;ts, could not, by all
their &s;ervices, attone for their adherence to the national
religion; and had been di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from their employments.
The pro&s;titute Jefferies him&s;elf, tho' he had &s;acrificed ho|nour
and ju&s;tice and humanity to the Court; yet becau&s;e
he refu&s;ed al&s;o to give tip his religion, was very fa&s;t de|clining
in favour and intere&s;t. Nothing now remained
but to open the door in the church and univer&s;ities to
the intru&s;ion of the Catholics; It was not long before
the King made this violent effort; and by con&s;training
the prelacy and e&s;tabli&s;hed church to &s;eek protection
in the principles of liberty, he at la&s;t left him&s;elf entirely
without friends and adherents.</P>
<P>FATHER Francis, a Benedictine, was recommended
by the King's mandate to the university of Cambridge
for the degree of ma&s;ter of arts; and as it was u&s;ual for
the univer&s;ity to confer that degree on per&s;ons eminent
for learning, without regard to their religion; and as
they had even admitted lately the &s;ecretary to the am|ba&s;&s;ador
of Morocco; the King on that account thought
him&s;elf the better intitled to compliance. But the uni|ver&s;ity
con&s;idered, that there was a great difference be|tween
a compliment be&s;towed on foreigners, and degrees
which gave a title to vote in all the elections and decrees
of the univer&s;ity; and which, if conferred on the Ca|tholics,
would infallibly in time render that &s;ect entirely
&s;uperior. They therefore refu&s;ed to obey the King's
mandate, and were cited to appear before the court of
eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion. The vice chancellor was &s;u&s;|pended;
but as the univer&s;ity cho&s;e a man of &s;pirit to
&s;ucceed him, the King thought proper for the pre&s;ent to
drop his preten&s;ions.</P>
<P>THE attempt upon the univer&s;ity of Oxford was pro|&s;ecuted
with more inflexible ob&s;tinacy, and was at|tended
<PB N="257" REF="323">
with more important con&s;equences. This uni|ver&s;ity
had lately in their famous decree made a &s;olemn
profe&s;&s;ion of pa&s;&s;ive obedience; and the Court probably
expected,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Attempt upon Mag|dalen co|lege.</NOTE> that they would &s;how their &s;incerity, when
their turn came to practi&s;e that doctrine; which, tho',
if carried to the utmo&s;t extent, it be contrary both to
rea&s;on and to nature, is apt to meet with the mo&s;t ef|factual
oppo&s;ition from the latter principle. The pre&s;i|dent
of Magdalen colllege, one of the riche&s;t foundations
in Europe, dying about this time, a mandate was &s;ent in
favour of Farmer, a new convert, but one, who, be|&s;ides
his being a Catholic, had not in other re&s;pects the
qualities required by the &s;tatutes for enjoying that of|fice.
The fellows of the college made very &s;ubmi&s;&s;ive
applications to the King for recalling his mandate; but
before they received an an&s;wer, the day came, on which, by
their &s;tatutes, they were required to proceed to an election.
They therefore cho&s;e Dr. Hough, a man of virtue, as
well as of the firmne&s;s and vigour requi&s;ite for maintain|ing
his own rights and tho&s;e of the univer&s;ity. In order
to puni&s;h the college for this contumacy, as it was called,
an inferior eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion was &s;ent down, and
the new pre&s;ident and the fellows were cited before that
court. So little regard had been paid to any other con|&s;ideration
be&s;ides religion, that Farmer, on enquiry,
was found guilty of the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t &s;candalous
vices; in&s;omuch that even the eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion|ers
were a&s;hamed to in&s;i&s;t on his election. A new man|date,
therefore, was i&s;&s;ued in favour of Parker, lately
created bi&s;hop of Oxford, a man of a pro&s;titute cha|racter,
but who, like Farmer, attoned for all his vices
by his avowed willingne&s;s to embrace the catholic reli|gion.
The college repre&s;ented, that all pre&s;idents had
ever been appointed by election, and there were even
few in&s;tances of the King's interpo&s;ing by his recom|mendation
in favour of any candidate; that having al|ready
<PB N="258" REF="324">
made a regular election of a pre&s;ident, they could
not, during his life, deprive him of his office, and &s;ub|&s;titute
any other in his place; that, even if there was a
vacancy, Parker, by the &s;tatutes of their founder, could
not be cho&s;en; that they had all of them bound them|&s;elves
by oath to observe the&s;e &s;tatutes, and never on any
account to accept of a di&s;pen&s;ation; and that the col|lege
had at all times &s;o much di&s;tingui&s;hed it&s;elf by its
loyalty, that nothing but the mo&s;t invincible nece&s;&s;ity
could now oblige them to oppo&s;e his Maje&s;ty's inclinations.
All the&s;e rea&s;ons availed them nothing. The pre&s;ident
and all the fellows, except two who complied, were ex|pelled
the college; and Parker was put in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the office. This act of violence, of all tho&s;e committed
during the reign of James, is perhaps the mo&s;t illegal
and arbitrary. When the di&s;pen&s;ing power was the mo&s;t
&s;trenuou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on by court lawyers, it had &s;till been
allowed, that the &s;tatutes, which regard private property
could not legally be infringed by that prerogative: Yet
ill this in&s;tance it appeared, that even the&s;e were not
now &s;ecure from inva&s;ion. The privileges of a college
are attacked: Men are illegally di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of their pro|perty,
for adhering to their duty, to their oaths, and to
their religion: The fountains of the church are at|tempted
to be poy&s;oned; nor would it be long, it was
concluded, ere all eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as well as civil prefer|ments,
would be be&s;towed on &s;uch as, negligent of ho|nour,
virtue, and &s;incerity, ba&s;ely &s;acrificed their faith to
the reigning &s;uper&s;tition. Such were the general &s;enti|ments;
and as the univer&s;ities have an intimate con|nexion
with the eccle&s;ia&s;tical e&s;tabli&s;hments, and mightily
intere&s;t all tho&s;e who have there received their education,
this arbitrary proceeding begot an univer&s;al di&s;content
again&s;t the King's admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE next mea&s;ure of the Court was an in&s;ult &s;till
more open on the eccle&s;ia&s;tics, and rendered the breach
<PB N="259" REF="325">
between the King and that powerful body fatal, as well as
incurable. It is &s;trange, that James, when he felt,
from the &s;entiments of his own heart, what a mighty
influence religious zeal had over him, &s;hould yet be &s;o
infatuated as never once to &s;u&s;pect, that it might po&s;|&s;ibly
have a proportional authority over his &s;ubjects.
Could he have profited from repeated experience, he
had &s;een in&s;tances enough of their &s;trong aver&s;ion to|wards
that communion, which, from a violent, im|perious
di&s;po&s;ition, he was determined, by every po&s;|&s;ible
expedient, to introduce into his kingdoms.</P>
<P>THE King publi&s;hed a &s;econd declaration of indul|gence,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1688.</NOTE>
almo&s;t in the &s;ame terms with the former; and he
&s;ubjoined an order, that, immediately after divine &s;ervice
it &s;hould be read by the clergy in all the churches. As
they were known univer&s;ally to di&s;approve of the
u&s;e made of the &s;u&s;pending power, this clau&s;e, they
thought, could be meant only as an in&s;ult upon them;
and they were &s;en&s;ible, that, by their compliance, they
would expo&s;e them&s;elves, both to public contempt, on
account of their tame behaviour, and to public hatred,
by their indirectly patronizing &s;o obnoxious a preroga|tive<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot">When Charles di&s;&s;olved his la&s;t Parliament, he &s;et forth a declaration giving his rea&s;ons for that mea&s;ure, and this declaration the clergy had been ordered to read to the people after divine &s;ervice. The&s;e orders were agreeable to their party prejudices, and they willingly &s;ubmitted to them. The contrary was now the ca&s;e.</NOTE>.
They were determined, therefore, almo&s;t univer&s;ally
to preserve the regard of the people; their only
protection, while the laws were become of &s;o little va|lidity,
and while the Court was &s;o deeply engaged in op|po&s;ite
intere&s;ts. In order to encourage them in this re|&s;olution,
&s;ix prelates, to wit, Lloyde bi&s;hop of St.
A&s;aph, Ken of Bath and Wells, Turner of Ely, Lake
of Chiche&s;ter, White of Peterborow, and Trelawney
<PB N="260" REF="326">
of Bri&s;tol, met privately with the primate, and concerted
the form of a petition to the King. They there repre|&s;ented
in few words, that, tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the highe&s;t
&s;en&s;e of loyalty, a virtue of which the church of En|gland
had given &s;uch eminent te&s;timonies; tho' de&s;irous
of affording ea&s;e in a legal way to all Prote&s;tant Di&s;|&s;enters;
yet becau&s;e the declaration of indulgence was
founded on a prerogative, formerly declared illegal by
Parliament, they could not, in prudence, honour, or
con&s;cience, &s;o far make them&s;elves parties as the di&s;tri|bution
of it all over the kingdom would be interpreted
to amount to. They therefore be&s;ought the King, that
he would not in&s;i&s;t upon their reading that declaration<NOTE N="p" PLACE="foot">The words of the petition were. That the great aver&s;ene&s;s found in them&s;elves to their di&s;tributing and publi&s;hing in all their churches your Maje&s;ty's late declaration for liberty of con&s;cience, proceeds neither from any want of duty and obedience to your Maje&s;ty (our holy mother, the church of England, being both in her principles and her con&s;tant practice unque&s;tionably loyal, and having to her great honour been more than once publicly acknowleged to be &s;o by your gracious Maje&s;ty) nor yet from any want of tenderne&s;s to Di&s;&s;enters, in relation to whom we are willing to come to &s;uch a temper as &s;hall be thought fit, when the matter &s;hall be con&s;idered and &s;ettled in Parliament and Convocation. But among many other con|&s;iderations, from this e&s;pecially, becau&s;e that declaration is founded upon &s;uch a di&s;pen&s;ing power as hath been o&s;ten declared illegal in Parliament, and particularly in the years 1662 and 1672, and in the beginning of your Maje&s;ty's reign, and is a matter of &s;o great moment and con&s;equence to the whole nation both in church, and &s;tate, that your petitioners cannot in prudence, honour, or conscience &s;o far make them&s;elves parties to it as a di&s;tribution of it all over the nation and the &s;olemn publication of it once and again, even in God's hou&s;e, and in the time of divine &s;ervice, mu&s;t amount to in common and reasonable con&s;truction.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE King was incapable, not only of yielding to the
greate&s;t oppo&s;ition, but of allowing the &s;lighte&s;t and
mo&s;t re&s;pectful contradiction to pa&s;s unpuni&s;hed. He
immediately embraced a re&s;olution (and his re&s;olutions, when once embraced, were inflexible) of puni&s;hing the
bi&s;hops, for a petition &s;o popular in its matter, and &s;o
prudent and cautious in the expre&s;&s;ion. As the petition
<PB N="261" REF="327">
was delivered him in private, he &s;ummoned them before
the council; and there questioned them whether they
would acknowledge it. The bi&s;hops &s;aw his intention,
and &s;eemed long de&s;irous to decline an&s;wering; But be|ing
pu&s;hed by the chancellor, they at la&s;t owned the pe|tition.
On their refu&s;al to give bail, an order was im|mediately
drawn for their commitment to the Tower;
and the Crown lawyers received directions to pro&s;ecute
them for the &s;editious libel, which, it was pretended,
they had compo&s;ed and uttered.</P>
<P>THE people were already aware of the danger,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Impri&s;on|ment,</NOTE> to
which the prelates were expo&s;ed; and were rai&s;ed to the
highe&s;t pitch of anxiety and attention with regard to
the i&s;&s;ue of this extraordinary affair. But when they be|held
the&s;e fathers of the church brought from court
under the cu&s;tody of a guard, when they &s;aw them em|barked
in ve&s;&s;els on the river, and conveyed towards the
Tower, all their affection for liberty, all their zeal for
religion, blazed up at once; and they flew to behold
this affecting and animating &s;pectacle. The whole &s;hore
was covered with crowds of pro&s;trate &s;pectators, who at
once implored the ble&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e holy, pa&s;tors, and ad|dre&s;&s;ed
their petitions towards Heaven for protection du|ring
this extreme danger, to which their country and
their religion &s;tood expo&s;ed. Even the &s;oldiers, &s;eized
with the contagion of the &s;ame &s;pirit, flung them&s;elves
on their knees before the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed prelates, and craved
the benediction of tho&s;e criminals, whom they were ap|pointed
to guard. Some per&s;ons ran into the water,
that they might participate more nearly of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings,
which the prelates were di&s;tributing on all around them.
The bi&s;hops them&s;elves, during this triumphant &s;uffering,
augmented the general favour, by the mo&s;t lowly &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ive
deportment; and they &s;till exhorted the people
to fear God, honour the King, and maintain their
loyalty; expre&s;&s;ions more animating than the mo&s;t in|flammatory

&s;peeches. And no &s;ooner had they entered
the precincts of the Tower than they hurried to chapel,
in order to return thanks for tho&s;e afflictions, which
Heaven, in defence of its holy cau&s;e, had thought them
worthy to endure.</P>
<P>THEIR pa&s;&s;age,<NOTE PLACE="marg">$$ial</NOTE> when conducted to their trial, was,
if po&s;&s;ible, attended with greater crowds of anxious
&s;pectators. All men &s;aw the dangerous cri&s;is, to which
affairs were reduced, and were &s;en&s;ible, that the i&s;&s;ue
could not po&s;&s;ibly be put on a more favourable cau&s;e,
than that in which the King had &s;o imprudently en|gaged.
Twenty-nine temporal peers (for the other pre|lates
&s;tood aloof) attended the pri&s;oners to We&s;tmin&s;ter
Hall; and &s;uch crowds of gentry followed the proce&s;&s;ion,
that &s;carce any room was left for the populace to enter.
The lawyers for the bi&s;hops were Sir Robert Sawyer,
Sir Francis Pemberton, Pollexfen, Treby, and Sommers.
No cau&s;e, even during the pro&s;ecution of the popi&s;h plot,
was ever heard with &s;o much zeal and attention. The
popular torrent, which, of it&s;elf, ran fierce and &s;trong,
was now farther irritated by the opposition of the go|vernment.</P>
<P>THE council for the bi&s;hops pleaded, that the law al|lowed
&s;ubjects, if they thought them&s;elves aggrieved in
any particular, to addre&s;s them&s;elves by petition to the
King, provided they kept within certain bounds, which
the &s;ame law pre&s;cribed them, and which in the pre&s;ent
petition the prelates had rigidly ob&s;erved: That an active
obedience in ca&s;es, which were contrary to con&s;cience,
was never pretended to be due to government; and law
was allowed to be the great mea&s;ure of the compliance
and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of &s;ubjects: That when any per&s;on found
commands to be impo&s;ed upon him, which he could not
obey, it was more re&s;pectful to offer to the Prince his
rea&s;ons for refu&s;al, than to remain in an ob&s;tinate and
refractory &s;ilence: That it was no breach of duty $$&s;ubjects,
<PB N="263" REF="331">
even tho' not expre&s;ly called upon, to di&s;cover
their &s;en&s;e of public mea&s;ures, in which every one had
&s;o intimate a concern: That the bi&s;hops in the pre&s;ent
ca&s;e were called upon, and mu&s;t either expre&s;s their ap|probation
by compliance, or their di&s;approbation by pe|tition:
That it could be no &s;edition to deny the prero|gative
of &s;u&s;pending the laws; becau&s;e there really was
no &s;uch prerogative, nor ever could be, in a legal and
limited government: That even if this prerogative was
real, it had yet been frequently di&s;puted before the whole
nation, both in We&s;tmin&s;ter-hall, and in both hou&s;es of
Parliament; and no one had ever dreamed of puni&s;hing the
denial of it as criminal; That the prelates, in&s;tead of
making an appeal to the people, had applied in pri|vate
to his Maje&s;ty, and had even delivered their pe|tition
&s;o fecretly, that except by the confe&s;&s;ion, extorted
from them before the council, it was &s;ound impo&s;&s;ible to
prove them the authors: And that tho' the petition was
afterwards printed and di&s;per&s;ed, it was not &s;omuch as
attempted to be proved, that they had the lea&s;t knowlege
of that publication.</P>
<P>THESE arguments were convincing in them&s;elves, and
were heard with a very favourable di&s;po&s;ition by the au|dience.
Even &s;ome of the judges, tho' their &s;eats were
held during plea&s;ure, declared them&s;elves in favour of
the pri&s;oners. The jury however, from what cau&s;e is
not certainly known, took &s;everal hours to deliberate,
and kept, during &s;o long a time, the people in the mo&s;t
anxious expectation. But when the wi&s;hed for verdict,
<HI>not guilty,</HI><NOTE PLACE="marg">17th of June. and acquit|tal of the bi&s;hops.</NOTE> was at la&s;t pronounced, the intelligence was
echoed thro' the hall, was conveyed to the crowds with|out,
was carried into the city, and was propagated with
infinite joy throughout the kingdom.</P>
<P>EVER &s;ince Monmouth's rebellion, the King had,
every &s;ummer, encamped his army on Houn&s;low heath,
that he might both improve their di&s;cipline, and by &s;o
unu&s;ual a &s;pectacle over-awe the mutinous people. A
<PB N="264" REF="332">
popi&s;h chapel was openly erected in the mid&s;t of the
camp, and great pains taken, tho' in vain, to bring over
the &s;oldiers to that communion. The few converts,
whom the prie&s;ts had made, were treated with &s;uch con|tempt
and ignominy, as deterred every one from follow|ing
the example. Even the Iri&s;h officers, whom the
King introduced into the army, &s;erved rather, from the
aver&s;ion borne them, to weaken his intere&s;t among them.
It happened, that the very day, on which the bi&s;hops'
trial was fini&s;hed, the King had reviewed the troops, and
had retired into lord Fever&s;ham, the general's, tent;
when he was &s;urprized to hear a great uproar in the
camp, attended with the mo&s;t extravagant &s;ymptoms of
tumultuary joy. He &s;uddenly enquired the cau&s;e, and
was told by Fever&s;ham, &startq;It was nothing but the re|joicing
of the &s;oldiers for the acquittal of the bi&s;hops.
Do you call that nothing?&endq; replied he, &startq;but &s;o much
the wor&s;e for them.&endq;</P>
<P>THE King was &s;till determined to ru&s;h forwards in
the &s;ame cour&s;e, where he was already, by his precipitate
career, &s;o fatally advanced. Tho' he knew, that every
order of men, except a handful of Catholics, were en|raged
at his pa&s;t mea&s;ures, and &s;till more terrified with
the future pro&s;pect; tho' he &s;aw that the &s;ame di&s;con|tents
had reached the army, his &s;ole re&s;&s;ource during the
general di&s;affection: Yet was he incapable of changing
his mea&s;ures, or even of remitting his violence in the
pro&s;ecution of them. He &s;truck out two of the judges,
Powel and Holloway, who had appeared to favour the
bi&s;hops: He i&s;&s;ued orders to pro&s;ecute all tho&s;e clergy|men,
who had not read his declaration; that is, the
whole church of England, two hundred excepted: He
&s;ent a mandate to the new fellows, whom he had ob|truded
on Magdalen-College, to elect for pre&s;ident, in
the room of Parker, lately decea&s;ed, one Gifford, a
doctor of the Sorbonne, and titular bi&s;hop of Madura:
And he is even &s;aid to have nominated the &s;ame per&s;on
<PB N="265" REF="333">
to the &s;ee of Oxford. So great an infatuation is perhaps
an object of compa&s;&s;ion rather than of anger: And is really
&s;urpri&s;ing in a man, who, in other re&s;pects, was not
deficient in &s;en&s;e and accompli&s;hments.</P>
<P>A FEW days before the acquittal of the bi&s;hops, an
event happened, which, in the King's &s;entiments, much
overballanced all the mortifications,<NOTE PLACE="marg">10th of June. Birth of the Prince of Wales.</NOTE> which he had re|ceived
on that occa&s;ion. The Queen was brought to
bed of a &s;on, who was baptized by the name of James.
This ble&s;&s;ing was impatiently longed for, not only by
the King and Queen, but by all the zealous Catholics
both abroad and at home. They &s;aw, that the King
was pa&s;t middle age; and that on his death the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
mu&s;t devolve on the Prince and Prince&s;s of Orange, two
zealous Prote&s;tants, who would &s;oon replace every thing
on the antient foundations. Vows therefore were of|fered
at every &s;hrine for a male &s;ucce&s;&s;or: Pilgrimages
were undertaken, particularly one to Loretto, by the
dutche&s;s of Modena; and &s;ucce&s;s was chiefly attributed
to that pious journey. But in proportion as this event
was agreeable to the Catholics, it encrea&s;ed the di&s;gu&s;t
of the Prote&s;tants, by depriving them of that agreeable,
tho' &s;omewhat di&s;tant pro&s;pect, in which at pre&s;ent they
flattered them&s;elves. Calumny even went &s;o far as to
a&s;cribe to the King the de&s;ign of impo&s;ing on the world
a &s;uppo&s;ititious child, who might be educated in his
principles, and after his death &s;upport the catholic reli|gion
in his dominions. The nation almo&s;t univer&s;ally
believed him capable, from bigotry, of committing any
crime; as they had &s;een, that, from like motives, he
was guilty of every imprudence: And the affections of
nature, they thought, would be ea&s;ily &s;acrificed to the
&s;uperior motives of propagating a catholic and orthodox
faith. The pre&s;ent occa&s;ion was not the fir&s;t, when
that calumny had been propagated. In the year 1682,
the Queen, then Dutche&s;s of Yorke, had been preg|nant;

and rumours were &s;pread, that an impo&s;ture
would, at that time, be put upon the nation: But hap|pily,
the infant proved a female, and thereby &s;pared the par|ty
all the trouble of &s;upporting their improbable fiction<NOTE N="q" PLACE="foot">This &s;tory is taken notice of in a weekly paper, the Ob&s;ervator, pub|li&s;hed at that very time, 23d of Augu&s;t, 1682.

<P>WHILE every motive, civil and religious, concurred
to alienate from the King every rank and denomi|nation
of men, it might be expected, that his throne
would, without delay, fall to pieces by its own weight:
<PB N="267" REF="337">
But &s;uch is the influence of e&s;tabli&s;hed government; &s;o
aver&s;e are men from beginning hazardous enterprizes;
that had not the nation received &s;uccour from abroad, af|fairs
might long have remained in their pre&s;ent delicate
&s;ituation, and the King might at la&s;t have prevailed in
his ra&s;h, and ill concerted projects.</P>
<P>THE Prince of Orange,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Conduct of the Prince of Orange.</NOTE> ever &s;ines his marriage with
the Lady Mary, had maintained a very prudent conduct;
agreeable to that &s;ound under&s;tanding, with which he
was &s;o eminently endowed. He made it a maxim to
concern him&s;elf very little in Engli&s;h affairs, and never by
any mea&s;ure to di&s;gu&s;t any of the factions, or give um|brage
to the Prince, who filled the throne. His natural
inclination, as well as his intere&s;t, led him to employ
him&s;elf with a&s;&s;iduous indu&s;try in the affairs of the con|tinent,
and to oppo&s;e the grandeur of the French Mo|narch,
again&s;t whom he had long, both from per&s;onal
and political con&s;iderations, conceived the mo&s;t violent
animo&s;ity. By this conduct, he gratified the prejudices
the whole Engli&s;h nation: But as he cro&s;&s;ed the in|clinations
of Charles, who &s;ought peace by compliance
With France, he had much declined in the favour and af|fections
of that monarch.</P>
<P>JAMES on his acce&s;&s;ion found it &s;o much his intere&s;t
to live in good terms with the heir apparent, that he
&s;howed the Prince &s;ome demonstrations of friend&s;hip;
and the Prince on his part was not wanting in every in|&s;tance
of duty and regard towards the King. On Mon|mouth's
inva&s;ion, he immediately di&s;patched over &s;ix re|giments
of Briti&s;h troops, which were in the Dutch &s;er|vice:
and he offered to take the command of the King's
forces again&s;t the rebels. However much he might di&s;|approve
the maxims of the King's admini&s;tration, he
ever kept a total &s;ilence on that &s;ubject, and gave no
countenance to tho&s;e di&s;contents, which were propagated
with &s;uch indu&s;try throughout the nation.</P>
<P><PB N="268" REF="338">
IT was from the application of James him&s;elf, that
the Prince fir&s;t openly took any part in English affairs.
Notwith&s;tanding the lofty ideas, which the King had
entertained of his own prerogative, he found, that the
edicts, emitted from it, &s;till wanted much of the au|thority
of laws, and that the continuance of them might
in the i&s;&s;ue become dangerous, both to him&s;elf and to
the Catholics, whom he de&s;ired to favour. An act of
Parliament alone could en&s;ure the indulgence or tolera|tion,
which he had laboured to e&s;tabli&s;h; and he hoped,
that, if the Prince would declare in favour of that &s;cheme,
the members, who had hitherto re&s;i&s;ted all his own ap|plications,
would at la&s;t be prevailed with to adopt it.
The con&s;ent, therefore, of the Prince to the repeal of
the penal &s;tatutes and of the te&s;t was &s;trongly &s;ollicited
by the King; and in order to engage him to agree to that
mea&s;ure, hopes were given<NOTE N="r" PLACE="foot">Burnet, vol. i. p. 711. D'Avaux, 15th of April, 1688.</NOTE>, that England would &s;econd
him in all tho&s;e enterprizes, which his active and exten&s;ive
genius had with &s;uch &s;ucce&s;s formed on the continent.</P>
<P>THE Prince knew,<NOTE PLACE="marg">He forms a league against France.</NOTE> that the Emperor and the King of
Spain were enraged by the repeated injuries, which they
had &s;uffered from the ambition of Lewis, and &s;till more,
by the frequent in&s;ults, which his pride had made them
undergo. He was apprized of the influence of the&s;e
Monarchs over the Catholic Princes of the empire: He
had him&s;elf obtained a great authority with the prote|&s;tant
Princes: And he formed a project of uniting Eu|rope
in one general league again&s;t the encroachments of
France, which &s;eemed &s;o nearly to threaten the liberty
and independance of all its neighbours.</P>
<P>No characters are more incompatible than tho&s;e of a
conqueror and a per&s;ecutor; and Lewis &s;oon found, that,
be&s;ides his weakening France by the bani&s;hment of &s;o
many u&s;eful &s;ubjects, the refugees had enflamed all the
prote&s;tant nations again&s;t him, and had rai&s;ed him ene|mies,
<PB N="269" REF="339">
who, in defence of their religion as well as li|berty,
were ob&s;tinately re&s;olved to oppo&s;e his progre&s;s.
The city of Am&s;terdam and other towns in Holland,
which had before fallen into a dependance on France:
being terrified with the accounts, which they every mo|ment
received, of the furious persecutions again&s;t the Hu|gonots,
had now dropped all private factions, and had en|tered
into an entire confidence with the Prince of Orange<NOTE N="s" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, 24th of July, 1681; 10th of June, 15th of October, 11th of November, 1688; vol. iv. p. 30.</NOTE>.
The prote&s;tant. Princes of the empire had formed a &s;e|parate
league at Magdebourg for the defence of their re|ligion.
The Engli&s;h were anew enraged at the blind
bigotry of their Sovereign, and were di&s;po&s;ed to embrace
the mo&s;t de&s;perate re&s;olutions again&s;t him. From a view
of the &s;tate of Europe during this period, it appears, that
Lewis, be&s;ides &s;ullying an illu&s;trious reign, had wan|tonly
by this per&s;ecution rai&s;ed invincible barriers to his
arms, which otherwi&s;e it had been very difficult, if not
impo&s;&s;ible, to re&s;i&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Prince of Orange knew how to avail him&s;elf of
all the&s;e advantages. By his intrigues and influence a
league was formed at Au&s;bourg, where the whole em|pire
united in its defence again&s;t the French Monarch.
Spain and Holland became parties in the alliance. The
acce&s;&s;ion of Savoy was afterwards obtained. Sweden
and Denmark &s;eemed to favour the fame cau&s;e. But
tho' the&s;e numerous &s;tates composed the greater part of
Europe, the league was &s;till deemed imperfect and un|equal
to its end; &s;o long as England maintained that
neutrality, in which &s;he had hitherto per&s;evered.</P>
<P>JAMES, tho' more prone to bigotry, was more &s;en|&s;ible
to his own and to national honour than his brother;
and had he not been confined by the former motive, he
would have maintained with more &s;pirit the intere&s;t and
independance of his kingdoms. When a pro&s;pect, there|fore,
<PB N="270" REF="340">
appeared of promoting his religious &s;chemes by
oppo&s;ing the progre&s;s of France, he was not aver&s;e to
that mea&s;ure; and he gave his &s;on-in-law room to hope,
that, by concurring with his views in England, he
might prevail with him to &s;econd tho&s;e projects, which
the Prince was &s;o ambitious of promoting.</P>
<P>A MORE tempting offer could not be made to a per&s;on
of his enterprizing character:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Refu&s;es to concur with the King.</NOTE> But the objections to that
mea&s;ure, upon deliberation, appeared to him in&s;uperable.
The King, he ob&s;erved, had incurred the mo&s;t violent
hatred of his own &s;ubjects: Great apprehen&s;ions were
entertained of his de&s;igns: The only re&s;&s;ource, which
the nation &s;aw, was in the future &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of the Prince
and Prince&s;s: Should he concur in tho&s;e dreaded mea|&s;ures,
he would draw on him&s;elf all the odium, under
which the King laboured: The nation might even re|fu&s;e
to bear the expence of alliances, which would in
that ca&s;e become &s;o &s;u&s;picious: And he might him&s;elf
incur danger of lo&s;ing a &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, which was awaiting
him, and which the egregious indi&s;cretion of the King
&s;eemed even to give him hopes of reaping before it
&s;hould devolve to him by the cour&s;e of nature. The
Prince, therefore, would go no farther than to promi&s;e
his con&s;ent to the repeal of the penal &s;tatutes, by which
the Nonconformi&s;ts as well as Catholics were expo&s;ed
to puni&s;hment. The te&s;t he e&s;teemed a &s;ecurity ab&s;o|lutely
requi&s;ite for the e&s;tabli&s;hied religion.</P>
<P>THE King did not remain &s;atisfied with a &s;ingle trial.
There was one Stuart, a Scots lawyer, who had been
bani&s;hed for tr$a&s;onable practices; bnt who had after|wards
obtained a pardon, and had been recalled. By the
King's directions, Stuart wrote &s;everal letters to pen&s;ion|ary
Fagel, with whom he had contracted an acquaint|ance
in Holland; and be&s;ides urging all the motives for
an unlimited toleration, he de&s;ired, that his rea&s;ons
&s;hould, in the King's name, be communicated to the
<PB N="271" REF="341">
Prince and Prince&s;s of Orange. Fagel during a long
time made no reply; b$t finding, that his &s;ilence was
con&s;trued into an a&s;&s;ent, he at la&s;t expre&s;&s;ed his own &s;en|timent
and that of their Highne&s;&s;es. the &s;aid, that it
was their fixed opinion, that no man, merely becau&s;e
he differed from the e&s;tabli&s;hed faith, &s;hould ever, while he
remained a peaceable &s;ubject, be expo&s;ed to any puni&s;h|ment
or even mole&s;tation: That the Prince and Prince&s;s
of Orange gave heartily their con&s;ent for repealing le|gally
all the penal &s;tatutes, as well tho&s;e enabled again&s;t
the Catholics as again&s;t the Prote&s;tant Nonconformi&s;ts;
and would concur with the King in any mea&s;ure for that
purpo&s;e. That the te&s;t was not to be considered as a
penalty inflicted on the profe&s;&s;ors of any religion, but
as a &s;ecurity provided for the e&s;tabli&s;hed wor&s;hip. That
it was no puni&s;hment on men to be excluded from pub|lic
offices, and to live peaceably on their own revenues
or indu&s;try. That even in the United Provinces, which
were &s;o often cited as models of toleration, tho' all &s;ects
were admitted, yet civil offices were only enjoyed by the
profe&s;&s;ors of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion. That military com|mands,
indeed, were &s;ometimes be&s;towed on Catholics;
but as they were conferred with great precaution, and
&s;till lay under the controul of the magi&s;trate, they could
give no ju&s;t rea&s;on for umbrage. And that their High|ne&s;&s;es,
however de&s;irous of gratifying the King, and of
endeavouring, by every means, to render his reign
peaceable and happy, could not agree to any mea&s;ure, which
would expo&s;e their religion to &s;uch imminent danger.</P>
<P>WHEN this letter was publi&s;hed, as it &s;oon was, it
in&s;pired great courage into the Prote&s;tants of all denomi|nations,
and &s;erved to keep them united in their oppo|&s;ition
to the encroachments of the Catholics. On the
other hand, the King, who was not contented with a
&s;imple toleration for his own religion, but was re&s;olved,
that it &s;hould enjoy great credit, if not an, ab&s;olute &s;u|periority
<PB N="272" REF="342">
was extremely di&s;gu&s;ted, and took every oc|ca&s;ion
to expre&s;s his di&s;plea&s;ure, as well again&s;t the Prince
of Orange as the United Provinces. He gave the Al|gerine
pyrates, who preyed on the Dutch, a reception in his
harbours, and liberty to dir&s;po&s;e of their prizes.
He revived &s;ome complaints of the Ea&s;t India company
with regard to the affair of Bantam<NOTE N="u" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, 21&s;t of January, 1687.</NOTE>. He required the
&s;ix Briti&s;h regiments in the Dutch &s;ervice to be &s;ent over.
He began to put his navy in a formidable condition.
And from all his movements, the Hollanders entertained
apprehen&s;ions, that he &s;ought only an occa&s;ion and pre|tence
for making war upon them.</P>
<P>THE Prince in his turn re&s;olved to pu&s;h affairs with
more vigour,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Re&s;olves to oppo&s;e the King.</NOTE> and to pre&s;erve all the Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants
in his intere&s;ts, as well as maintain them firm in their
pre&s;ent union again&s;t the Catholics. He knew, that the
men of education in England were, marry of them, re|tained
in their religion more by honour than by prin|ciple
<NOTE N="x" PLACE="foot">Burnet.</NOTE>; and that, tho' every one was a&s;hamed to be
the fir&s;t pro&s;elyte, yet, if the example was once &s;et by
&s;ome eminent-per&s;ons, intere&s;t would every day make
considerable conver&s;ions to a communion, which was &s;o
zealou&s;y encouraged by the Sovereign. Dyvkelt there|fore
was &s;ent over as envoy to England; and the Prince
gave him in&s;tructions, be&s;ides publickly remon&s;trating
with the King on his conduct both at home and abroad,
to apply in his name, after a proper manner, to every
&s;ect and denomination. To the church party he &s;ent
a&s;&s;urances of favour and regard, and prote&s;ted, that his
education in Holland had no wi&s;e prejudiced him again&s;t
epi&s;copal government. The Nonconformi&s;ts he ex|horted
not to be deceived by the fallacious care&s;&s;es of a
popi&s;h Court, but to wait patiently, till, in the maturity
of time, laws, enacted by Prote&s;tants, &s;hould give them
<PB N="273" REF="343">
that toleration, which, with &s;o much rea&s;on, they had
long claimed and demanded. Dykvelt executed his
commi&s;&s;ion with &s;uch dexterity, that all orders of men
ca&s;t their eyes towards Holland, and expected thence a
deliverance from tho&s;e dangers, with which their reli|gion
and liberty were &s;o nearly threatened.</P>
<P>MANY of the mo&s;t considerable per&s;ons, both in
church and &s;tate,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Is applied to by the Eng|li&s;h.</NOTE> made &s;ecret applications to Dykvelt,
and thro' him to the Prince of Orange. Admiral Her|bert
too, tho' a man of great expence, and &s;eemingly of
little religion, had thrown up his employments, and
retired to the Hague, where he a&s;&s;ured the Prince of the
di&s;affection of the &s;eamen, by whom that admiral was
extremely beloved. Admiral Ru&s;&s;el, cou&s;in german to
the unfortunate lord of that name, pa&s;&s;ed frequently
between England and Holland, and kept the communi|cation
open with all the great men of the prote&s;tant party.
Henry Sidney, brother to Algernon, and uncle to the
earl of Sunderland, came over under pretence of drink|ing
the waters at Spaw, and conveyed &s;till &s;tronger a&s;|&s;urances
of an univer&s;al combination again&s;t the mea|&s;ures
of the King. Lord Dumblaine, &s;on to the earl
of Danby, being ma&s;ter of a frigate, made &s;everal voy|ages
to Holland, and carried from many of the nobility
tenders of duty, and even con&s;iderable &s;ums of money<NOTE N="y" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux, 14th and 24th of September, 8th and 15th of October, 1688.</NOTE>,
to the Prince of Orange.</P>
<P>THERE remained, however, &s;ome rea&s;ons, which
retained all parties in awe, and kept them from breaking
out into immediate violence. The Prince, on the one
hand, was afraid of hazarding, by his inva&s;ion, an in|heritance,
which the laws en&s;ured to the Prince&s;s; and
the Engli&s;h Prote&s;tants, on the other hand, from the
pro&s;pect of her &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, &s;till entertained hopes of ob|taining
at la&s;t a peaceable and a &s;afe redre&s;s of all their
grievances. But when the Prince of Wales was born,
<PB N="274" REF="344">
both the Prince and the Engli&s;h nation were reduced to
de&s;pair, and &s;aw no re&s;&s;ource but in a confederacy for
their mutual intere&s;ts. And thus the event which the
King had &s;o long made the object of his mo&s;t ardent
prayers, and from which he expected the firm e&s;tabli&s;h|ment
of his throne, proved the immediate cau&s;e of his
ruin and downfall.</P>
<P>ZUYLESTEIN, who had been &s;ent over to congratulate
the King on the birth of his &s;on, brought the Prince
formal invitations from mo&s;t of the great men in Eng|land,
to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, by his arms, in the recovery of
their laws and liberty. The bi&s;hop of London, the
earls of Danby, Nottingham, Devon&s;hire, Dor&s;et, the
duke of Norfolk, the marque&s;s of Hallifax, the lords
Lovelace, Delamare, Paulet, Eland, Mr. Hambden,
Powle, Le&s;ter, be&s;ides many eminent citizens of Lon|don;
all the&s;e per&s;ons, tho' of the mo&s;t opposite parties,
concurred in their applications to the Prince. The
Whigs,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Coalition of parties.</NOTE> &s;ituable to their antient principles of liberty,
which had led them to attempt the exclu&s;ion bill, ea&s;ily
agreed to oppo&s;e a King, who&s;e conduct had verified
whatever his wor&s;t enemies had prognosticated of his
&s;ucce&s;&s;ion. The Tories and the church, party, finding
their pa&s;t &s;ervices forgotten, their rights invaded, their
religion threatened, agreed to drop for the pre&s;ent all
over-&s;trained doctrines of &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and attend to the
great and powerful dictates of nature. The Noncon|formi&s;ts,
dreading the care&s;&s;es of known and inveterate
enemies, deemed the offers of toleration more &s;ecure
from a Prince educated in tho&s;e principles, and accu&s;|tomed
to that practice. And thus all faction was for a
time laid a&s;leep in England; and rival parties, forget|ting
their animo&s;ity, had &s;ecretly concurred in a de&s;ign
of oppo&s;ing their unhappy and mi&s;guided Sovereign.
The earl of Shrew&s;bury, who had acquired great popu|larity
by de&s;erting, at this time, the Catholic religion
<PB N="275" REF="345">
in which he had been educated, left his regiment, mort|gaged
his e&s;tate for forty thou&s;and pounds, and made a
tender of his &s;word and pur&s;e to the Prince of Orange.
Lord Wharton, notwith&s;tanding his age and infirmities,
had taken a journey for the &s;ame purpo&s;e. Lord Mor|daunt
was at the Hague, and pu&s;hed on the enterprize
with that ardent and courageous &s;pirit, for which he
was &s;o eminent. Even Sunderland, the King's favou|rite
mini&s;ter, is believed to have entered into a corre|&s;pondence
with the Prince; and at the expence of
his own honour and his ma&s;ter's intere&s;t, to have &s;e|cretly
embraced a cau&s;e, which he fore&s;aw, was likely
&s;oon to predominate<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">D'Avaux was always of that opinion. See his Negotiations 6th and 20th of May, 18th, 27th of September, 22d of November, 1688. But it is pretended, that that lord always &s;ugge&s;ted moderate councils to the King; a &s;ure proof, if true, of his fidelity. See his defence.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE Prince was ea&s;ily determined to yield to the ap|plications
of the Engli&s;h, and to embrace the defence
of a nation, which, during its pre&s;ent fears and di&s;tre&s;&s;es,
regarded him as its &s;ole protector. The great object of
his ambition was to be placed at the head of a confede|rate
army, and by his valour to avenge the injuries,
which him&s;elf, his country, and his allies had &s;u&s;tained
from the haughty Lewis. But while England remained
under the pre&s;ent government, he de&s;paired of ever form|ing
a league, which would be able, with any probability
of &s;ucce&s;s, to make oppo&s;ition again&s;t that powerful
Monarch. The tyes of affinity could not be &s;uppo&s;ed
to have great influence over a per&s;on of the Prince's
rank and temper; much more, as he knew, that they
were at fir&s;t unwillingly contracted by the King, and
had never &s;ince been cultivated by any e&s;&s;ential favours
of good offices. Or &s;hould any reproach remain upon
him for violating the duties of private life; the glory of
delivering oppre&s;&s;ed nations would, he hoped, be able,
<PB N="276" REF="346">
in the eyes of all rea&s;onable men, to make ample com|pen&s;ation.
He could not well expect, on the commence|ment
of his enterprize, that it would lead him to mount
the throne of England: But he undoubtely fore&s;aw,
that its &s;ucce&s;s would e&s;tabli&s;h his authority in that
Kingdom. And &s;o egregious was James's temerity, that
there was no advantage, &s;o great or obvious, which that
Prince's indi&s;cretion might not afford his enemies.</P>
<P>THE Prince of Orange, thro'out his whole life,
was peculiarly happy in the &s;ituations, in which he
was placed. He &s;aved his own country from ruin, he
re&s;tored the liberties of the&s;e kingdoms, he &s;upported
the general independency of Europe. And thus, tho'
his virtue, it is confe&s;&s;ed, be not the pure&s;t, which we
meet with in hi&s;tory, it will be difficult to find any per|&s;on,
who&s;e actions and conduct have contributed more
eminently to the general intere&s;ts of &s;ociety and of
mankind.</P>
<P>THE time,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's prepara|tions.</NOTE> when the Prince entered on his enterprize,
was very well cho&s;en; as the people were then in the
highe&s;t ferment, on account of the in&s;ult, which the
impri&s;onment and trial of the bi&s;hops had put upon the
church, and indeed upon all the Prote&s;tants of the na|tion.
His method of conducting the preparations was
no le&s;s wi&s;e and politic. Under other pretences he had
beforehand made con&s;iderable augmentations to the
Dutch fleet; and the &s;hips were at that time lying in
harbour. Some additional troops were al&s;o levied; and
&s;ums of money, rai&s;ed for other purpo&s;es, were di|verted
by the Prince to the u&s;e of this expedition. The
States had given him their entire confidence; and partly
from terror of the exorbitant power of France, partly
from di&s;gu&s;t at &s;ome re&s;traints laid on their commerce
in that kingdom, were &s;en&s;ible how nece&s;&s;ary &s;ucce&s;s in
this enterprize was become to their dome&s;tic happine&s;s
and &s;ecurity. Many of the neighbouring Princes re|garded
<PB N="277" REF="347">
him as their guardian and protector, and were
guided by him in all their councils. He held confe|rences
with Ca&s;tanaga, governor of the Spani&s;h Ne|therlands,
with the Electors of Bradenburgh and Saxony,
with the Landgrave of He&s;&s;e-Ca&s;&s;el, with the whole
hou&s;e of Lunenbourg. It was agreed, that the&s;e Princes
&s;hould replace the troops employed again&s;t England, and
&s;hould protect the United Provinces during the ab&s;ence
of the Prince of Orange. Their forces were already on
their march for that purpo&s;e: A con&s;iderable encamp|ment
of the Dutch army was formed near Nimeguen:
Every place was in motion; and tho' the roots of this
con&s;piracy reached from one end of Europe to the other,
&s;o &s;ecret were the Prince's councils, &s;o fortunate was
the di&s;po&s;ition of affairs, that he &s;till could cover his
preparations under other pretences; and little &s;u&s;picion
was entertained of his real intentions.</P>
<P>THE King of France, menaced by the league of
Aug&s;bourg, had re&s;olved to &s;trike the fir&s;t blow again&s;t
the allies; and having &s;ought a quarrel with the Em|peror
and the Elector Palatine, he had invaded Ger|many
with a great army, and had laid &s;iege to Philip&s;|bourg.
The Elector of Cologne, who was al&s;o Bi&s;hop
of Liege and Mun&s;ter, and who&s;e territories almo&s;t en|tirely
&s;urrounded the United Provinces, had died about
this time; and the candidates for that rich &s;ucce&s;&s;ion
were Prince Clement of Bavaria, &s;upported by the
hou&s;e of Au&s;tria, and the cardinal of Fur&s;temberg, a
prelate entirely dependant on France. The pope, who
favoured the allies, was able to throw the ballance be|tween
the parties, and Prince Clement was cho&s;en; a
circm&s;tance which contributed extremely to the &s;ecurity
of the States. But as the cardinal kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of many
of the fortre&s;&s;es, and had applied to France for &s;uccours,
the neighbouring territories were all in motion; and by
this means the preparations of the Dutch and their allies

&s;eemed intended merely for their own defence again&s;t the
enterprizes of Lewis.</P>
<P>ALL the artifices, however, of the Prince could not en|tirely
conceal his real intentions from the &s;agacity of the
French court. D'Avaux, Lewis's envoy at the Hague,
had been able, by a compari&s;on of circum&s;tances, to trace
the purpo&s;es of the preparations in Holland; and he in|&s;tantly
informed his ma&s;ter of the di&s;covery. Lewis con|veyed
the intelligence to James; and accompanied the
information with a very important offer.<NOTE PLACE="marg">Offers of France to the King.</NOTE> He was willing
to join a &s;quadron of French &s;hips to the Engli&s;h fleet;
and to &s;end over any number of troops, which James
&s;hould judge requi&s;ite for his &s;ecurity. When this pro|po&s;al
was rejected, he again offered to rai&s;e the &s;iege of
Philip&s;bourg, to march his army into the Netherlands,
and by the terror of his arms to detain the Dutch forces
In their own country. This propo&s;al met with no better
reception.</P>
<P>JAMES was not,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Rejected.</NOTE> as yet, entirely convinced, that his
&s;on in law intended an inva&s;ion upon England. Fully
per&s;waded, him&s;elf, of the &s;acredne&s;s of his own autho|rity,
he fancied, that a like belief had made deep im|pre&s;&s;ion
on his &s;ubjects; and notwith&s;tanding the &s;trong
&s;ymptoms of di&s;content which broke out, &s;uch an uni|ver&s;al
combination in rebellion appeared to him no wi&s;e
credible. His army, in which he tru&s;ted, and which he
had con&s;iderably augmented, would be ea&s;ily able, he
thought, to repel foreign force, and to &s;uppre&s;s any &s;e|dition
among the populace. A &s;mall number of French
troops, joined to the&s;e, might tend only to breed di&s;con|tent;
and afford them a pretence for mutinying again&s;t
foreigners, &s;o much feared and hated by the nation. A
great body of auxiliaries might indeed &s;ecure him both
again&s;t an inva&s;ion from Holland, and again&s;t the rebellion
of his own &s;ubjects; but would be able afterwards to re|duce
him to total dependance, and render his authority
<PB N="279" REF="351">
entirely precarious. Even the French inva&s;ion of the
Low Countries might be attended with very dangerous
con&s;quences; and would &s;uffice, in the&s;e jealous times,
to revive the old &s;u&s;picion of a combination again&s;t Hol|land,
and again&s;t the prote&s;tant religion; a &s;u&s;picion,
which had already produced &s;uch di&s;contents in England.
The&s;e were the views &s;ugge&s;ted by Sunderland, and it mu&s;t
be confe&s;&s;ed, that the rea&s;ons, on which they were
founded, were &s;ufficiently plau&s;ible; as indeed the &s;itu|ation,
to which the King had reduced him&s;elf, was, to
the la&s;t degree, delicate and perplexing.</P>
<P>STILL Lewis was unwilling to abandon a friend and
ally, who&s;e intere&s;t he regarded as clo&s;ely connected with
his own. By the &s;ugge&s;tion of Skelton, the King's mi|ni&s;ter
at Paris, orders were &s;ent to D'Avaux to remon|&s;trate
with the States in Lewis's name again&s;t tho&s;e pre|parations,
which they were making to invade England.
The &s;trict amity, &s;aid the French mini&s;ter, which &s;ub&s;i&s;ts
between the two monarchs will make Lewis regard every
attempt again&s;t his ally as an act of ho&s;tility again&s;t him|&s;elf.
This remon&s;trance had a very bad effect, and put
the States in a flame. What is this alliance, they a&s;ked,
between France and England, which has been &s;o care|fully
concealed from us? Is it of the &s;ame nature with
the former; meant for our de&s;truction and for the ex|tirpation
of the prote&s;tant religion? If &s;o, it is high time
for us to provide for our own defence, and to anticipate
tho&s;e projects, which are forming again&s;t us.</P>
<P>EVEN James was di&s;plea&s;ed with this officious &s;tep taken
by Lewis for his &s;ervice. He was not reduced, he &s;aid,
to the condition of the cardinal of Fur&s;temberg, and ob|liged
to &s;eek the protection of France. He recalled Skel|ton,
and threw him into the Tower for his ra&s;h con|duct.
He &s;olemnly di&s;avowed D'Avaux's memorial;
and prote&s;ted, that no alliance &s;ub&s;i&s;ted between him and
Lewis, but what was public and known to all the world.
The States, however, &s;till affected to appear incredulous
<PB N="280" REF="352">
on that article<NOTE N="b" PLACE="foot">That there really was no new alliance formed betwixt France and Eng|land appears both from Sunderland's apology, and from D'Avaux's negotia|tions, lately publi&s;hed: See Vol. IV. p. 18. Eng. Tran&s;lation. 27th of September, 1687. 16th of March, 6th of May, 10th of Augu&s;t, 2d, 23d, and 24th of September, 5th and 7th of October, 11th of November, 1688.</NOTE>; and the Engli&s;h, extremely prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
again&s;t their Sovereign, firmly believed, that a project
was concerted with Lewis for their entire &s;ubjection.
Port&s;mouth, it was &s;aid, was to be put into the hands
of that ambitious monarch: England was to be filled
with French and Irish troops: And every man, who was
not willing to embrace the Romi&s;h &s;uper&s;tition, was by
the&s;e bigotted Princes devoted to &s;udden de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THESE &s;ugge&s;tions were every where &s;pread abroad,
and tended extremely to augment the di&s;contents, of
which both the fleet and army, as well as the people,
betrayed every day the mo&s;t evident &s;ymptoms. The
fleet had begun to mutiny; becau&s;e Stricland, the ad|miral,
a Roman Catholic, introduced the ma&s;s aboard
his &s;hip, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the prote&s;tant chaplain. It
was with &s;ome difficulty they could be appea&s;ed; and
they &s;till per&s;i&s;ted in declaring, that they would not
fight again&s;t the Dutch, whom they called friends and
brethren; but would willingly engage the French, whom
they regarded as national enemies. The King had in|tended
to augment his army with Iri&s;h rercuits, and he
re&s;olved to try the experiment on the regiment of
the Duke of Berwic, his natural &s;on; but Beaumont,
the lieutenant-colonel, refu&s;ed to admit them; and to
this oppo&s;ition five captains &s;teadily adhered. They were
all ca&s;hiered; and had not the di&s;contents of the army
on this occa&s;ion become very apparent, it was re&s;olved
to have tried and puni&s;hed tho&s;e officers for mutiny.</P>
<P>THE King made a trial of the di&s;po&s;itions of his army,
in a manner &s;till more undi&s;gui&s;ed. Finding oppo&s;ition
from all the civil and eccle&s;ia&s;tical powers of the king|dom,
he re&s;olved to appeal to the military, who, if
unanimous, were able alone to &s;erve all his purpo&s;es, and
<PB N="281" REF="353">
enforce univer&s;al obedience. His intention was to en|gage
all the regiments, one after another, to give their
con&s;ent to the repeal of the te&s;t and penal &s;tatutes; and
accordingly, the major of Litchfield's drew out the bat|tallion
before the King, and told them, that they were
required either to enter into his Maje&s;ty's views, in the&s;e
particulars, or to lay down their arms. The King was
&s;urpri&s;ed to find, that, two captains and a few popi&s;h
&s;oldiers excepted, the whole battallion immediately em|braced
the latter part of the alternative. For &s;ome time,
he remained &s;peechle&s;s; but having recovered from his
a&s;toni&s;hment, he commanded them to take up their arms;
adding with a &s;ullen, di&s;contented air, &startq;That for the
future, he would not do them the honour to a&s;k their
advice.&endq;</P>
<P>WHILE the King was di&s;mayed with the&s;e &s;ymptoms
of general di&s;affection, he received a letter from the mar|que&s;s
of Albeville,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of Sep|tember.</NOTE> his mini&s;ter at the Hague; which in|formed
him with certainty that he was &s;oon to look for a
powerful inva&s;ion from Holland, and that Pen&s;ionary
Fagel had at la&s;t acknowledged, that the &s;cope of all
the Dutch preparations was to tran&s;port forces into Eng|land.
Tho' James could rea&s;onably expect no other in|telligence,
he was a&s;toni&s;hed at the news: He grew pale,
and the letter dropped from his hand: His eyes were now
opened, and he found him&s;elf on the brink of a frightful
precipice, which his delu&s;ions had hitherto concealed
from him. His mini&s;ters and councellors, equally a&s;to|ni&s;hed
with him&s;elf, &s;aw no re&s;&s;ource but in a &s;udden and
precipitant retraction of all tho&s;e fatal mea&s;ures, by which
he had created him&s;elf &s;o many enemies, foreign and do|mestic.
He paid court to the Dutch, and offered to enter
into any alliance with them for common &s;ecurity:<NOTE PLACE="marg">The King retracts his mea&s;ures.</NOTE> He
replaced in all the counties the deputy-lieutenants and
ju&s;tices, who had been deprived of their commi&s;&s;ions for
their adherence to the te&s;t and the penal laws: He re|&s;tored
<PB N="282" REF="354">
the charters of London and of all the corporations:
He annulled the court of eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion: He
took off the bi&s;hop of London's &s;u&s;pen&s;ion: He re-in|&s;tated
the expelled pre&s;ident and fellows of Magdalen
college: And he was even reduced to care&s;s tho&s;e bi&s;hops,
whom he had &s;o lately pro&s;ecuted and in&s;ulted. All the&s;e
mea&s;ures were regarded as &s;ymptoms of fear, not of re|pentance.
The bi&s;hops, in&s;tead of promi&s;ing &s;uccour, or
&s;ugge&s;ting comfort, recapitulated to him all the in&s;tances
of his mal-admini&s;tration, and advi&s;ed him thencefor|wards
to follow more &s;alutary council. And as intel|ligence
arrived of a great di&s;a&s;ter, which had befallen the
Dutch fleet, it is commonly believed, that the King re|called,
for &s;ome time, the conce&s;&s;ions, which he had or|dered
to be made to Magdalen college; A very bad &s;ign
of his &s;incerity in his other conce&s;&s;ions. Nay, &s;o pre|valent
were his unfortunate prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ions, that, amid&s;t
all his pre&s;ent di&s;tre&s;&s;es, he could not forbear, at the bap|ti&s;m
of the young Prince, from appointing the Pope to
be one of the godfathers.</P>
<P>THE report, that a &s;uppo&s;ititious child was to be im|po&s;ed
on the nation, had been widely &s;pread, and greedily
received, before the Prince of Wales's birth: But the
King, who, without &s;eeming to take notice of the mat|ter,
might ea&s;ily have qua&s;hed that ridiculous rumour,
had, from an ill-timed haughtine&s;s, totally neglected it.
He di&s;dained, he &s;aid, to &s;atisfy tho&s;e, who could deem
him capable of &s;o ba&s;e and villainous an action. Finding
that the calumny &s;till gained ground, and had made deep
impre&s;&s;ion on his &s;ubjects, he was now obliged to &s;ubmit
to the mortifying office of a&s;certaining the reality of that
birth. Tho' no particular attention had been beforehand
given to en&s;ure proof, the evidence, both of the Queen's
pregnancy and delivery, was rendered indi&s;putable; and
&s;o much the more, as no argument or proof of any im|portance,
nothing but popular rumour and &s;urmize, could
be thrown into the oppo&s;ite &s;cale.</P>
<P><PB N="283" REF="355">
MEANWHILE, the Prince of Orange's declaration was
di&s;per&s;ed over the kingdom, and met with univer&s;al ap|probation.
All the grievances of the nation were there
enumerated:<NOTE PLACE="marg">Prince's declaration.</NOTE> The di&s;pen&s;ing and &s;u&s;pending power;
the court of eccle&s;ia&s;tical commi&s;&s;ion; the filling all offices
with Catholics, and the rai&s;ing a je&s;uit to be a privy-coun|&s;ellor;
the open encouragement given to popery, by
building every where churches, colleges, &s;eminaries for
that &s;ect; the di&s;placing of judges, if they refu&s;ed to
give &s;entence according to orders received from Court;
the annulling the charters of all the corporations, and the
&s;ubjecting the election of members to arbitrary will and
plea&s;ure; the treating petitions, even the mo&s;t mode&s;t,
and from per&s;ons of the highe&s;t rank, as criminal and &s;e|ditious;
the committing the whole authority of Ireland,
civil and military, into the hands of Papi&s;ts; the a&s;&s;uming
an ab&s;olute power over the religion and laws of Scot|land,
and openly exacting in that kingdom an obedience
without re&s;erve; and the violent pre&s;umptions again&s;t the
legitimacy of the Prince of Wales. In order to redre&s;s
all the&s;e grievances, the Prince &s;aid, that he intended to
come over into England with an armed force, which
might protect him from the King's evil coun&s;ellors:
And that his &s;ole aim was to have a legal and free Parlia|ment
&s;ummoned, who might provide for the &s;afety and
liberty of the nation, as well as examine the proofs of
the Prince of Wales's legitimacy. No one, he added,
could entertain &s;uch hard thoughts of him as to imagine,
that he had formed other de&s;igns than to procure the full
and la&s;ting &s;ettlement of the religion, liberty, and pro|perty
of the &s;ubject. The force, which he intended to
bring with him, was totally di&s;proportioned to any views
of conque&s;t; and it were ab&s;urd to &s;u&s;pect, that &s;o many
per&s;ons of high rank, both in church and &s;tate, would
have given him &s;o many &s;olemn invitations for &s;uch a
pernicious purpo&s;e. Tho' the Engli&s;h mini&s;ters, terri|fied

with his enterprize, had pretended to redre&s;s &s;ome
of the grievances complained of; there &s;till remained the
foundation of all grievances, that upon which they could
in an in&s;tant be again erected, an arbitrary and de&s;potic
power in the Crown. And for this u&s;urpation there was
no po&s;&s;ible remedy, but by a full declaration of all the
rights of the &s;ubject in a free Parliament.</P>
<P>SO well concerted were the Prince's mea&s;ures, that,
in three days, above four hundred tran&s;ports were hired;
the army quickly fell down the rivers and canals from
Nimeguen;<NOTE PLACE="marg">21&s;t of Oc|tober.</NOTE> the artillery, arms, &s;tores, hor&s;es were em|barked;
and the Prince &s;et &s;ail from Helvoet-Sluice, with
a fleet of near five hundred ve&s;&s;els, and an army of above
fourteen thou&s;and men. He fir&s;t encountered a &s;torm,
which drove him back: But his lo&s;s being &s;oon repaired,
the fleet put to &s;ea under the command of admiral Her|bert,
and made &s;ail with a fair wind towards the we&s;t of
England. The &s;ame wind detained the King's fleet in
the river, and enabled the Dutch to pa&s;s the Straits of
Dover without mole&s;tation. Both &s;hores were covered
with multitudes of people, who, be&s;ides admiring the
grandeur of the &s;pectacle, were held in anxious &s;u&s;pence
by the pro&s;pect of an enterprize, the mo&s;t important,
which, during &s;ome ages, had been undertaken in Eu|rope.
The Prince had a pro&s;perous voyage, and landed
his army &s;afely in Torbay on the fifth of November, the
anniver&s;ary of the gunpowder-trea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Dutch army marched fir&s;t to Exeter; and the
Prince's declaration was there publi&s;hed. That whole
county was &s;o terrified with the executions, which had
en&s;ued upon Monmouth's rebellion, that no body for &s;e|veral
days joined the Prince. The bi&s;hop of Exeter in a
fright fled to London, and carried to Court intelligence
of the inva&s;ion. As a reward of his zeal, he received the
archbi&s;hopric of York, which had long been kept vacant,
with an intention, as was univer&s;ally believed, of be&s;tow|ing
<PB N="285" REF="359">
it on &s;ome Catholic. The fir&s;t per&s;on, who joined
the Prince, was major Burrington; and he was quickly
followed by the gentry of the counties of Devon and So|mer&s;et.
Sir Edward Seymour made propo&s;als for an a&s;&s;o|ciation,
which every one &s;igned. By degrees, the earl
of Abington, Mr. Ru&s;&s;el, &s;on to the earl of Bedford,
Mr. Wharton, Godfrey, Howe came to Exeter. All
England was in commotion.<NOTE PLACE="marg">General commotion.</NOTE> Lord Delamere took arms
in Che&s;hire, the earl of Danby &s;eized York, the earl of
Bath governor of Plymouth, declared for the Prince, the
earl of Devon&s;hire made a like declaration in Derby.
The nobility and gentry of Nottingham embraced the
&s;ame cau&s;e; and every day there appeared &s;ome effect of
of that univer&s;al combination, into which the nation had
entered again&s;t the mea&s;ures of the King. Even tho&s;e
who took not the field again&s;t him, were able to embarra&s;s
and confound his councils. A petition for a free Parlia|ment
was &s;igned by twenty-four bi&s;hops and peers of the
greate&s;t di&s;tinction, and was pre&s;ented to the King. No
one thought of oppo&s;ition or re&s;i&s;tance again&s;t the inva|der.</P>
<P>BUT the mo&s;t dangerous &s;ymptom was the di&s;affection,<NOTE PLACE="marg">De&s;ertion of the army.</NOTE>
which, from the general &s;pirit of the nation, not from
any particular rea&s;on, had crept into the army. The of|ficers
&s;eemed all di&s;po&s;ed to prefer the intere&s;ts of their
country and of their religion before tho&s;e principles of
honour and fidelity, which are commonly e&s;teemed the
mo&s;t &s;acred ties by men of that profe&s;&s;ion. Lord Col|che&s;ter,
&s;on to the earl of Rivers, was the fir&s;t officer who
de&s;erted to the prince; and he was attended by a few of
his troops. Lord Lovelace made a like effort; but was
intercepted by the militia under the duke of Beaufort,
and taken pri&s;oner: Lord Cornbury, &s;on to the earl of
Clarendon, was more &s;ucce&s;sful. He attempted to carry
over three regiments of cavalry; and he actually brought
a con&s;iderable part of them to the Prince's quarters. Se|veral

officers of di&s;tinction informed Fever&s;ham, the ge|neral,
that they could not in con&s;cience fight again&s;t the
Prince of Orange.</P>
<P>LORD CHURCHHILL had been rai&s;ed from the rank of
a page, and had been inve&s;ted with a high command in
the army, had been created a peer, and had owed his
whole fortune to the King's bounty: Yet even this per|&s;on
could re&s;olve, during the pre&s;ent extremity, to de&s;ert
his unhappy ma&s;ter, who had ever repo&s;ed entire confi|dence
in him. He carried with him the duke of Gra&s;ton,
natural &s;on to the late King, colonel Berkeley, and &s;ome
troops of dragoons. This conduct was a &s;ignal &s;acrifice
to public virtue of every duty in private life; and re|quired,
for ever after, the mo&s;t upright, the mo&s;t di&s;|intere&s;ted,
and mo&s;t public &s;pirited behaviour to render
it ju&s;tifiable.</P>
<P>THE King had arrived at Sali&s;bury, the head quarters
of his army, when he received this fatal news. That
Prince, though a &s;evere enemy, had ever appeared a
warm, &s;teady, and &s;incere friend; and he was extremely
&s;hocked with this, as well as with many other in&s;tances
of ingratitude, to which he was now expo&s;ed. There
remained none in whom he could confide. As the whole
army had di&s;covered &s;ymptoms of di&s;content, he con|cluded
it full of treachery; and being de&s;erted by tho&s;e
whom he had mo&s;t favoured and obliged,<NOTE PLACE="marg">25th of No|vember.</NOTE> he no longer
expected that others would hazard their lives in his &s;er|vice.
During this di&s;traction and perplexity, he em|braced
a &s;udden re&s;olution of drawing off his army, and
retiring towards London: A mea&s;ure, which could only
&s;erve to betray his fears, and provoke farther treachery.</P>
<P>BUT Churchhill had prepared a &s;till more mortal blow
for his di&s;tre&s;t benefactor. His lady and he had an en|tire
a&s;cendant over the family of Prince George of Den|mark;
and the time now appeared &s;ea&s;onable for over|whelming
the unhappy King, who was already &s;tagger|ing
<PB N="287" REF="363">
with the violent &s;hocks, which he had received. An|dover
was the fir&s;t &s;tage of his Maje&s;ty's retreat towards
London; and there, prince George, together with the
young duke of Ormond, Sir George Huet, and &s;ome other
per&s;ons of di&s;tinction,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and of Prince George.</NOTE> de&s;erted him in the night-time,
and retired to the Prince's camp. No &s;ooner had this
news reached London, than the prince&s;s Anne, pretend|ing
fear of the King's di&s;plea&s;ure,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and of the Prince&s;s Anne.</NOTE> withdrew her&s;elf in
the company of the bi&s;hop of London and lady Church|hill.
She fled to Nottingham; where the earl of Dor&s;et
received her with great re&s;pect, and the gentry of the
county quickly formed a troop for her protection.</P>
<P>THE late King, in order to gratify the nation, had
entru&s;ted the education of his nieces entirely to Prote&s;|tants;
and as the&s;e prince&s;&s;es were deemed the chief re&s;|&s;ource
of the e&s;tabli&s;hed religion after their father's de|fection,
great care had been taken to in&s;till into them,
from their earlie&s;t infancy, the &s;tronge&s;t prejudices again&s;t
popery. During the violence too of &s;uch popular currents,
as now prevailed in England, all private con&s;iderations
are commonly lo&s;t in the general pa&s;&s;ion; and the more
principle any per&s;on po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, the more apt is he, on &s;uch
occa&s;ions, to neglect and abandon his dome&s;tic duties.
Though the&s;e cau&s;es may account for the Prince&s;s's be|haviour,
they had no way prepared to King to expect &s;o
a&s;toni&s;hing an event. He bur&s;t into tears, when the fir&s;t
intelligence of it was conveyed to him. Undoubtedly he
fore&s;aw in this incident the total expiration of his royal<NOTE PLACE="marg">King's con&s;teration.</NOTE>
authority: But the nearer and more intimate concern of
a parent laid hold of his heart; when he found him&s;elf
abandoned in his uttermo&s;t di&s;tre$s by a child, and a virtu|ous
child, whom he had ever regarded with the mo&s;t ten|der
affection. &startq;God help me,&endq; cried he, in the ex|tremity
of his agony, &startq;my own children have for&s;aken
me!&endq; It is indeed &s;ingular, that a Prince, who&s;e chief

&s;hould be expo&s;ed, from religious antipathy, to &s;uch treat|ment
as even Nero, Domitian, or the mo&s;t enormous ty|rants,
that have di&s;graced the records of hi&s;tory, never
met with from their friends and family.</P>
<P>SO violent were the prejudices, which at this time
prevailed, that this unhappy father, who had been de|&s;erted
by his favourite child, was believed, upon her
di&s;appearance, to have put her to death: And it was
fortunate, that the truth was timely di&s;covered; other|wi&s;e
the populace, even the King's guards them&s;elves,
might have been engaged, in revenge, to commence a
ma&s;&s;acre of the prie&s;ts and Catholics.</P>
<P>THE King's fortune now expo&s;ed him to the contempt
of his enemies; and his behaviour was not &s;uch as could
procure him the e&s;teem of his friends and adherents.
Unable to re&s;i&s;t the torrent, he pre&s;erved not pre&s;ence of
mind in yielding to it; but &s;eemed in this emergence as
much depre&s;&s;ed with adver&s;ity, as he had before been
vainly elated by pro&s;perity. He called a council of all
the peers and prelates who were in London; and fol|lowed
their advice in i&s;&s;uing writs for a new Parliament,
and in &s;ending Halifax, Nottingham, and Godolphin, as
commi&s;&s;ioners to treat with the prince of Orange. But
the&s;e were the la&s;t acts of royal authority which he ex|erted.
He even hearkened to imprudent council, by
which he was prompted to de&s;ert the throne, and to gra|tify
his enemies beyond what their fonde&s;t hopes could
have promi&s;ed them.</P>
<P>THE Queen, ob&s;erving the fury of the people, and
knowing how much &s;he was the object of general hatred,
was &s;truck with the deepe&s;t terror, and began to appre|hend
a parliamentary impeachment from which &s;he was
told, the Queens of England were not exempted. The
popi&s;h courtiers, and above all, the prie&s;ts, were aware,
that they would be the fir&s;t &s;acrifice, and that their per|petual
bani&s;hment, was the &s;malle&s;t penalty, which they
<PB N="289" REF="367">
mu&s;t expect from national re&s;entment. They were there|fore
de&s;irous of carrying the King along with them;
who&s;e pre&s;ence, they knew, would &s;till be &s;ome re&s;ource
and protection to them in foreign countries, and who&s;e
re&s;toration, if it ever happened, would again re-in&s;tate
them in power and authority. The general defection of
the Prote&s;tants made the King regard the Catholics,
as his only &s;ubjects, on who&s;e council he could rely;
and the fatal cata&s;trophe of his father afforded them a
plau&s;ible rea&s;on for making him apprehend a like
fate. The infinite difference of circum&s;tances was not,
during's men pre&s;ent di&s;traction, &s;ufficiently weighed.
Even after the people were inflamed by a long civil war,
the execution of Charles the fir&s;t could not be deemed
a national deed: It was perpetrated by a fanatical army,
pu&s;hed on by a daring and enthu&s;ia&s;tic leader; and the
whole kingdom had ever entertained, and did &s;till enter|tain,
a mo&s;t violent abhorrence again&s;t that enormity.
The &s;ituation of public affairs, therefore, no more re|&s;embled
what they were forty years before, than the
Prince of Orange, either in birth, character, fortune,
or connexions, could be &s;uppo&s;ed a parallel to Crom|wel.</P>
<P>THE emmi&s;&s;aries of France, and among the re&s;t, Baril|lon,
the French amba&s;&s;ador, were bu&s;y about the King;
and they had entertained a very fal&s;e notion, which they
in&s;tilled into him; that nothing would more certainly re|tard
the public &s;ettlement, and beget univer&s;al confu&s;ion,
than his de&s;ertion of the kingdom. The Prince of Orange
had with good rea&s;on embraced a contrary opinion; and
he deemed it extremely difficult to find expedients for &s;e|curing
the nation, &s;o long as the King kept po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of
the crown. Actuated, therefore, by this public motive,
and no le&s;s, we may well pre&s;ume, by private ambition,
he was determined to u&s;e every expedient, which might
intimidate the King, and make him de&s;ert that throne,

which he him&s;elf was alone enabled to fill. He declined
a per&s;onal conference with the king's commi&s;&s;ioners, and
&s;ent the earls of Clarendon and Oxford to treat with
them: The terms, which he propo&s;ed, implied almo&s;t a
pre&s;ent participation of the &s;overeignty: And he &s;top|ped
not a moment the march of his army towards Lon|don.</P>
<P>THE news which the King received from all quarters,
helped to continue the panic, into which he was fallen,
and which his enemies expected to improve to their ad|vantage.
Colonel Copel, deputy-governor of Hull,
made him&s;elf ma&s;ter of that important fortre&s;s; and threw
into pri&s;on lord Langdale, the governor, a Catholic;
together with lord Montgomery, a nobleman of the &s;ame
religion. The town of Newca&s;tle received the lord
Lumly, and declared for the Prince of Orange and a free
Parliament. The duke of Norfolk, lord lieutenant of
the county of that name, engaged it in the &s;ame mea&s;ure.
The Prince's declaraion was read at Oxford by the duke
of Ormond, and was received with great applau&s;e by that
loyal Univer&s;ity, who al&s;o made an offer of their plate to
the Prince. Every day, &s;ome per&s;on of quality or di&s;|tinction,
and among the re&s;t, the duke of Somer&s;et,
went over to the enemy. A very violent declaration was
di&s;per&s;ed in the Prince's name, but not with his partici|pation;
in which every one was commanded to &s;eize and
puni&s;h all Papi&s;ts, who, contrary to law, pretended ei|ther
to carry arms, or exerci&s;e any act of authority. It
may not be unworthy of notice, that a merry ballad,
called Lilliballero, being at this time published in deri&s;ion
of the Papi&s;ts and the Iri&s;h, it was greedily received by
the people, and was univer&s;ally &s;ung by all ranks of men,
even by the King's army, who were &s;trongly &s;eized with
the national &s;pirit. This incident both di&s;covered, and
&s;erved to encrea&s;e, the general di&s;content of the king|dom.</P>
<P><PB N="291" REF="371">
THE contagion of mutiny and di&s;obedience had al&s;o
reached Scotland, whence the regular forces, contrary
to the advice of Balcarras, the trea&s;urer, were with|drawn,
in order to re-inforce the Engli&s;h army. The
marque&s;s of Athole, together with the vi&s;count Tarbat,
and others, finding the opportunity favourable, began to
form intrigues again&s;t Perth, the chancellor; and the
Pre&s;byterians and other malecontents flocked from all
quarters to Edinburgh. The chancellor, apprehen&s;ive
of the con&s;equences, found it expedient to withdraw;
and the populace, as if that event were a &s;ignal for their
in&s;urrection, immediately ro&s;e in arms, and rifled the
popi&s;h chapel in the king's palace. All the Catholics,
even all the zealous Royali&s;ts, were obliged to conceal
them&s;elves; and the privy council, in&s;tead of their for|mer
&s;ubmi&s;&s;ive &s;trains of addre&s;s to the King, and violent
edicts again&s;t their fellow-&s;ubjects, now made applications
to the Prince of Orange, as the &s;ole re&s;torer of law and
liberty.</P>
<P>THE King every moment alarmed, more and more,
with the&s;e proofs of a general di&s;affection, not daring to
repo&s;e tru&s;t in any but tho&s;e who were expo&s;ed to more
danger than him&s;elf, agitated by indignation towards in|gratitude,
by di&s;dain of infidelity, impelled by his own
fears and those of others, precipitantly embraced the re|&s;olution
of withdrawing to France, and he &s;ent off be|forehand
the Queen and the infant Prince, under the
conduct of count Lauzun,<NOTE PLACE="marg">and flight. 12th o$ December.</NOTE> an old favourite of the French
Monarch. He him&s;elf di&s;appeared in the night-time,
attended only by Sir Edward Hales, a new convert; and
made the be&s;t of his way to a &s;hip, which waited for him
near the mouth of the river. As if this mea&s;ure had
not been the mo&s;t grateful to his enemies of any which he
could adopt, he had carefully concealed his intention from
all the world; and nothing could equal the &s;urprize,
which &s;eized the city, the court, the kingdom, upon the
<PB N="292" REF="372">
di&s;covery of this &s;trange event. Men beheld, all on a
&s;udden, the reins of government thrown up by the hand
which held them; and &s;aw none, who had any right or
even preten&s;ion, to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of them.</P>
<P>THE more effectually to involve every thing in confu|&s;ion,
the King appointed not any one, who &s;hould, in
his ab&s;ence, exerci&s;e any part of the admini&s;tration; he
threw the great &s;eal into the river; and he recalled all
tho&s;e writs, which had been i&s;&s;ued for the elections of
the new Parliament. It is often &s;uppo&s;ed, that the &s;ole
motive, which impelled him to this &s;udden de&s;ertion,
was his reluctance to meet a free Parliament, and his re|&s;olution
not to &s;ubmit to tho&s;e terms, which his &s;ubjects
would deem requi&s;ite for the &s;ecurity of their liberties and
their religion. But it mu&s;t be con&s;idered, that his &s;ub|jects
had fir&s;t de&s;erted him, and entirely lo&s;t his confi|dence;
that he might rea&s;onably be &s;uppo&s;ed to entertain
fears for his liberty, if not for his life; and that the con|ditions
would not probably be moderate, which the na|tion,
&s;en&s;ible of his inflexible temper, enraged with the
violation of their laws and the danger of their religion,
and fore&s;eeing his re&s;entment on account of their pa&s;t
oppo&s;ition, would, in his pre&s;ent circum&s;tances, exact
from him.</P>
<P>BY this temporary di&s;&s;olution of government, the po|pulace
were now ma&s;ters; and there was no di&s;order,
which, during their pre&s;ent ferment, might not be dread|ed
from them. They ro&s;e in a tumult and de&s;troyed all
the ma&s;s-hou&s;es. They even attacked and rifled the
hou&s;es of the Florentine envoy and Spani&s;h amba&s;&s;ador,
where many of the Catholics had lodged their mo&s;t valu|able
effects. Jefferies, the chancellor, who had di&s;gui&s;ed
him&s;elf, in order to fly the kingdom, was di&s;covered by
them, and &s;o abu&s;ed, that he died in a little time after|wards.
Even the army, which &s;hould have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed
tho&s;e tumults, would, it was apprehended, &s;erve rather
<PB N="293" REF="373">
to encrea&s;e the general di&s;order. Fever&s;ham had no &s;ooner
heard of the King's retreat, than he di&s;banded the troops
in the neighbourhood, and without either di&s;arming
or paying them, let them loo&s;e to prey upon the coun|try.</P>
<P>IN this extremity, the bi&s;hops and peers, who were
in town, being the only remaining authority of the &s;tate
(for the privy council, compo&s;ed of the King's creatures,
was totally di&s;regarded) thought proper to a&s;&s;emble, and
to interpo&s;e for the pre&s;ervation of the community.
They cho&s;e the marque&s;s of Halifax their &s;peaker: They
gave directions to the mayor and aldermen for keeping
the peace of the city: They i&s;&s;ued orders, which were
readily obeyed, to the fleet, the army, and all the gar|ri&s;ons:
And they made applications to the Prince, who&s;e
enterprize they highly applauded, and who&s;e &s;ucce&s;s they
joyfully congratulated.</P>
<P>THE Prince on his part was not wanting to the tyde of
&s;ucce&s;s, which flowed in upon him, nor backward in
a&s;&s;uming that authority, which the pre&s;ent exigency had
put into his hands. Be&s;ides the general popularity, at|tending
his cau&s;e, a new incident made his approach to
London &s;till more welcome. In the pre&s;ent trepidation
of the people, a rumour aro&s;e, either from chance or de|&s;ign,
that the di&s;banded Iri&s;h had taken arms, and had
commenced an univer&s;al ma&s;&s;acre of all the Prote&s;tants in
England. This ridiculous belief was &s;pread all over the
kingdom in one day; and begot every where the deepe&s;t
con&s;ternation. The alarum bells were rung; the bea|cons
fired; men fancied that they &s;aw at a di&s;tance the
&s;moke of the burning cities, and heard the groans of
tho&s;e who were &s;laughtered in their neighbourhood. It
was &s;urprizing, that the Catholics did not all peri&s;h, in
the rage which naturally &s;ucceeds &s;uch popular panics.</P>
<P>WHILE every one, either from principle, intere&s;t, or
animo&s;ity, turned their back on the unhappy King, who
<PB N="294" REF="374">
had abandoned his own cau&s;e, the unwelcome news ar|rived,
that he had been &s;eized by the populace at Fever|&s;ham,
while he was making his e&s;cape in di&s;gui&s;e; that
he had been very much abu&s;ed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">King &s;eized at Fever|&s;ham.</NOTE> till he was known; but
that the gentry had then interpo&s;ed and protected him,
tho' they &s;till refu&s;ed to con&s;ent to his e&s;cape. This in|telligence
threw all parties into confu&s;ion. The Prince
&s;ent Zuyle&s;tein with orders, that the king &s;hould ap|proach
no nearer than Roche&s;ter; but the ma&s;&s;age came
too late. He was already arrived in London, where the
populace, moved by compa&s;&s;ion for his unhappy fate, and
actuated by their own levity, had received him with
&s;houts and acclamations.</P>
<P>DURING the King's abode at Whitehall, little atten|tion
was payed him by the nobility or any per&s;ons of di&s;|tinction.
They had, all of them, been previou&s;ly di&s;|gu&s;ted
on account of his blind partiality to the Catholics;
and they knew, that they were now become more crimi|nal
in his eyes by their late public applications to the
Prince of Orange. He him&s;elf &s;hewed not any &s;ymp|toms
of &s;pirit, nor di&s;covered any intention of re&s;uming
the reins of government, which he had once thrown
a&s;ide. His authority was now plainly expired; and as
he had exerci&s;ed his power, while po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it, with
very precipitant and haughty councils, he relinqui&s;hed
it by a de&s;pair, equally precipitant and pu&s;illanimous.</P>
<P>NOTHING remained for the now ruling powers but to
deliberate how they &s;hould di&s;po&s;e of his per&s;on. Be|&s;ides,
that the Prince may ju&s;tly be &s;uppo&s;ed to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
more genero&s;ity than to think of offering violence
to an unhappy monarch, &s;o nearly related, to him, he
knew, that nothing would &s;o effectually promote his own
views as the King's retreat into France, a country at all
times &s;o obnoxious to the Engli&s;h. It was determined,
therefore, to pu&s;h him into that mea&s;ure, which, of
him&s;elf, he &s;eemed &s;ufficiently inclined to embrace. The
<PB N="295" REF="375">
King having &s;ent lord Fever&s;ham on a civil me&s;&s;age to the
Prince, de&s;iring a conference for an accommodation in
order to the public &s;ettlement, that nobleman was put in
arre&s;t, under pretence of his wanting a pa&s;&s;port: The
Dutch guards were ordered to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of White|hall,
where the King then lodged, and to di&s;place the
Engli&s;h: And Halifax, Shrew&s;bury, and Delamere,
brought a me&s;&s;age from the Prince, which they delivered
to the King in bed after midnight, ordering him to leave
his palace next morning, and to depart for Ham, a &s;eat
of the dutche&s;s of Lauderdale's. He de&s;ired permi&s;&s;ion,
which was ea&s;ily granted, of retiring to Roche&s;ter, a
town near the &s;ea-coa&s;t. It was perceived, that the ar|tifice
had taken effect; and that the king, terrified with
this har&s;h treatment, had renewed his former re&s;olution of
leaving the kingdom.</P>
<P>HE lingered, however, &s;ome days at Roche&s;ter, under
the protection of a Dutch guard, and &s;eemed de&s;irous of
an invitation &s;till to keep po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the throne. He
was undoubtedly &s;en&s;ible, that, as he had, at fir&s;t, tru&s;t|ed
too much to his people's loyalty, and in confidence of
their &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, had offered the highe&s;t violence to their
principles and prejudices; &s;o had he, at la&s;t, on finding
his di&s;appointment, gone too far into the other extreme,
and had ha&s;tily &s;uppo&s;ed them void of all &s;en&s;e of duty or
allegiance. But ob&s;erving, that the church, the nobili|ty,
the city, the country, all concurred in neglecting
him, and leaving him to his own councils, he &s;ubmitted
to his melancholy fate; and being urged by earne&s;t let|ters
from the Queen,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Second eva|&s;ion.</NOTE> he privately embarked on board a
frigate which waited for him,<NOTE PLACE="marg">23d of De|cember.</NOTE> and he arrived &s;afely at

life, his conduct was irreproachable, and is intitled to
our approbation. Severe, but open in his enmities,
&s;teady in his councils, diligent in his &s;chemes, brave in
his enterprizes, faithful, &s;incere, and honourable in his
dealings with all men: Such was the character, with
which the duke of York mounted the throne of England.
In that high &s;tation, his frugality of public money was
remarkable, his indu&s;try exemplary, his application to
naval affairs &s;ucce&s;sful, his encouragement of trade ju|dicious,
his jealou&s;y, of national honour laudable: What
then was wanting to make him an excellent Sovereign?
A due regard and affection to the religion and con&s;titution
of his country. Had he been po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of this e&s;&s;ential
quality, even his middling talents, aided by &s;o many vir|tues,
would have rendered his reign honourable and hap|py.
When it was wanting, every excellency, which he
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, became dangerous and pernicious to his king|doms.</P>
<P>THE &s;incerity of this Prince (a virtue, on which he
highly valued him&s;elf) has been much que&s;tioned in tho&s;e
reiterated promi&s;es, which he made of pre&s;erving the
liberties and religion of the nation. It mu&s;t be conf&s;&s;|ed,
that his reign was one continued inva&s;ion of both;
yet is it known, that, to his la&s;t breath, he per&s;i&s;ted in
a&s;&s;erting, that he never meant to &s;ubvert the laws, or
procure more than a toleration and an equality of privi|leges
to his catholic &s;ubjects. This que&s;tion can only affect
the per&s;onal character of the King, not our judg|ment
of his public conduct. Tho' by a &s;tretch of can|dour
<PB N="297" REF="377">
we &s;hould admit of his &s;incerity in the&s;e profe&s;&s;ions,
the people were equally ju&s;tifiable in their re&s;i&s;tance of
him. So lofty was the idea, which he had entertained of
his <HI>legal</HI> authority, that it left his &s;ubjects little or no
right to liberty, but what was dependent on his &s;overeign
will and plea&s;ure. And &s;uch was his zeal of pro&s;elyti&s;m,
that, whatever he might have intended, he plainly &s;top|ped
not at toleration and equality: He confined all power,
encouragement, and favour to the Catholics: Converts
from intere&s;t would &s;oon have multiplied upon him: If
not the greate&s;t, at lea&s;t the be&s;t part of the people, he
would have flattered him&s;elf, were brought over to his re|ligion:
And he would in a little time have thought it
ju&s;t, as well as pious, to be&s;tow on it all the public e&s;|tabli&s;hments.
Rigours and per&s;ecutions again&s;t heretics
would &s;peedily have followed; and thus liberty and the
prote&s;tant religion would in the i&s;&s;ue have been totally
&s;ubverted; tho' we &s;hould not &s;uppo&s;e, that James, on
the commencement of his reign, had &s;eriou&s;ly formed a
plan for that purpo&s;e. And on the whole, allowing this
King to have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed good qualities and good intentions,
his conduct &s;erves only, on that very account, as a
&s;tronger proof, how dangerous it is to allow any Prince,
infected with that &s;uper&s;tition, to wear the crown of the&s;e
kingdoms.</P>
<P>AFTER this manner, the courage and abilities of the
Prince of Orange, &s;econded by &s;urprizing fortune, had
effected the deliverance of this; i&s;land; and with very lit|tle
effu&s;ion of blood (for only one officer of the Dutch
army and a few private &s;oldiers fell in an accidental &s;kir|mi&s;h)
had expelled from the throne a great Prince, &s;up|ported
by a formidable fleet and a numerous army. Still
the more difficult ta&s;k remained, and what perhaps the
Prince regarded as not the lea&s;t important: The obtain|ing
for him&s;elf that crown, which had fallen from the
head of his father-in-law. Some lawyers, intangled in
<PB N="298" REF="378">
the &s;ubtleties and forms of their profe&s;&s;ion, could think
of no expedient; but that the Prince &s;hould claim the
crown by right of conque&s;t; &s;hould a&s;&s;ume immediately
the title of Sovereign; and &s;hould call a Parliament,
which, being thus legally &s;ummoned by a King in po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion,
could ratify whatever had been tran&s;acted before
they a&s;&s;embled. But this mea&s;ure, being de&s;tructive of
all principles of liberty, the only principles on which his
future throne could be e&s;tabli&s;hed, was prudently reject|ed
by the Prince, who, finding him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the
good will of the nation, refolved to leave them entirely to
their own guidance and direction. The peers and bi&s;hops,
to the number of near ninety, made an addre&s;s, de&s;iring
him to &s;ummon a convention by circular letters; to a&s;|&s;ume,
in the mean time, the management of all public
affairs; and to concert mea&s;ures for the &s;ecurity of Ire|land.
At the &s;ame time, they re&s;u&s;ed reading a letter,
which the King had left in order to apologize for his
late de&s;ertion, by the violence which had been put upon
him. This &s;tep was a &s;ufficient indication of their in|tentions
with regard to that unhappy Monarch.</P>
<P>THE Prince, &s;eemed &s;till unwilling to act upon an au|thority,
which might be deemed &s;o imperfect: He was
de&s;irous of obtaining a more expre&s;s declaration of the
public con&s;ent. A very judicious expedient was fallen
on for that purpo&s;e. All the members, who had &s;at in
the Hou&s;e of Commons during any Parliament of Charles
the &s;econd (the only Parliaments who&s;e election was re|garded
as free) were invited to meet; and to them were
added The mayor, aldermen, and fifty of the common
council of the city. This was the mo&s;t proper repre&s;en|tative
of the people, which could be &s;ummoned during
the pre&s;ent emergence. They unanimou&s;ly voted the
&s;ame addre&s;s with the Lords: And the Prince, being
thus &s;upported by all the legal authority, which could
po&s;&s;ibly be obtained in this critical juncture, wrote circu|lar
<PB N="299" REF="379">
letters to the counties and corporations of England;
and his orders were univer&s;ally complied with. A mo&s;t
profound tranquility prevailed throughout the kingdom;
and the prince's admini&s;tration was &s;ubmitted to,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Convention &s;ummoned.</NOTE> as if he
had &s;ucceeded in the mo&s;t regular manner to the vacant
throne. The fleet received his orders: The army, with|out
murmur or oppo&s;ition, allowed him to new-model
them. And the city &s;upplied him with a loan of two
hundred thou&s;and pounds.</P>
<P>THE conduct of the Prince with regard to Scotland,<NOTE PLACE="marg">1689.</NOTE>
was founded on the &s;ame prudent and moderate maxims.<NOTE PLACE="marg">7th of Janu|ary.</NOTE>
Finding,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of Scotland.</NOTE> that there were many Scot&s;men of rank at that
time in London, he &s;ummoned them together, laid be|fore
them his intentions, and a&s;ked their advice in the
pre&s;ent emergency. This a&s;&s;embly, con&s;i&s;ting of thirty
noblemen and about four&s;core gentelmen, cho&s;e duke
Hamilton for pre&s;ident; a man, who, being of a tempo|rizing
character, was determined to pay court to the pre|&s;ent
authority. His elde&s;t &s;on, the earl of Arran, pro|fe&s;&s;ed
an adherence to King James; an u&s;ual policy in
Scotland, where the father and &s;on, during civil com|motions,
are often ob&s;erved to take, oppo&s;ite &s;ides: in
order to &s;ecure at all adventures the family from forfei|ture.
Arran propo&s;ed to invite back the King upon con|ditions;
but as he was vehemently oppo&s;ed in this motion
by Sir Patric Hume, and &s;econded by nobody, the a&s;&s;em|bly
made an offer to the Prince of the pre&s;ent admini&s;|tration,
which he willingly accepted. To anticipate a
little in our narration; a convention, by circular letters
from the Prince, was &s;ummoned at Edinburgh on the
twenty-&s;econd of March; where it was &s;oon vi&s;ible, that
the intere&s;t of the maleconte&s;ts would entirely prevail.
The more zealous Royali&s;ts, regarding this a&s;&s;embly as
illegal, had forborn to appear at elections; and the other
party were returned from mo&s;t places. The revolution
was not, in Scotland as in England, effected by the coa|lition

of Whig and Tory: The former party alone had
over-powered the government, and were too much en|raged
by the pa&s;t injuries, which they had &s;uffered, to
admit of any compo&s;ition with their former ma&s;ters. So
&s;oon as the purpo&s;e of the convention was di&s;covered,
the earl of Balcarras and vi&s;count Dundee, the leaders
of the Tories, withdrew from Edinburgh; and the con|vention
having pa&s;&s;ed a vote, that King James, by his
mal-admini&s;tration, and his abu&s;e of power, had <HI>forfeited</HI>
all title to the crown, they made a tender of the royal
dignity to the Prince and Prince&s;s of Orange.<NOTE PLACE="marg">22d of Ja|nuary.</NOTE></P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h convention was a&s;&s;embled;<NOTE PLACE="marg">Engli&s;h con|vention meets.</NOTE> and it im|mediately
appeared, that the Hou&s;e of Commons, both
from the prevailing humour of the people, and from the
influence of pre&s;ent authority, were mo&s;tly cho&s;en from
among the whig party. After thanks were unanimou&s;ly
given by both Hou&s;es to the Prince of Orange for the
deliverance, which he had brought them, a memorable
vote was in a few days pa&s;&s;ed by a great majority of the
Commons, and &s;ent up to the Hou&s;e of Peers for their
concurrence. It was contained in the&s;e words. &startq;That
King James the &s;econd, having endeavoured to &s;ubvert
the con&s;titution of the kingdom, by breaking the ori|ginal
contract betwixt King and people; and having,
by the advice of Je&s;uits and other wicked per&s;ons,
violated the fundamental laws, and withdrawn him&s;elf
out of the kingdom, has abdicated the government,
and that the throne is thereby vacant.&endq; This vote,
when carried to the upper Hou&s;e, met with great oppo|&s;ition;
of which it is here nece&s;&s;ary for us to explain the
rea&s;on.</P>
<P>THE Tories and the High-church-men, finding them|&s;elves
at once menaced with a &s;ubver&s;ion of their laws
and of their religion, had zealou&s;ly promoted the national
revolt, and had on this occa&s;ion departed from tho&s;e prin|ciples
of non-re&s;i&s;tance, of which, while the King fa|voured
them, they had formerly made &s;uch loud profe&s;|&s;ions.
<PB N="301" REF="383">
Their pre&s;ent apprehen&s;ions had prevailed over
their political tenets; and the unfortunate James, who
had too much relied on tho&s;e general declarations, which
never will be reduced to practice, found in the i&s;&s;ue that
both parties were &s;ecretly united in oppo&s;ition to him.
But no &s;ooner was the danger pa&s;&s;ed, and the general
fear &s;omewhat allayed, than party prejudices re&s;umed, in
&s;ome degree, their former authority; and the Tories were
a&s;hamed of that victory, which their antagoni&s;ts, during
the late tran&s;actions, had obtained over them. They
were inclined, therefore, to &s;teer a middle cour&s;e; and,
tho' generally determined to oppo&s;e the King's return,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Views of the parties.</NOTE>
they re&s;olved not to con&s;ent to the dethroning him, or
altering the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion. A regent with kingly
power was the expedient, which they propo&s;ed; and a
late in&s;tance in Portugal &s;eemed to give &s;ome authority
and precedent to that plan of government.</P>
<P>IN favour of this &s;cheme the Tories urged, that, by
the uniform tenor of the Engli&s;h laws, the right of the
crown was ever regarded as &s;acred, and could, on no ac|count,
and by no mal-admini&s;tration, be forfeited by the
Sovereign: That to dethrone a King and to elect his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or, was a practice quite unknown to the con&s;titu|tion,
and had a tendency to render kingly power entirely
dependant and precarious: That where the Prince, from
his tender years, from lunacy, or from other natural in|firmity,
was incapacitated to hold the reins of govern|ment,
both the laws and former practice agreed in ap|pointing
a regent, who, during the interval, was in|ve&s;ted
with the whole power of the admini&s;tration: That
the inveterate and dangerous prejudices of King James
had rendered him as unfit to &s;way the Engli&s;h &s;cepter, as
if he had fallen to lunacy; and it was therefore natural
for the people to have recour&s;e to the &s;ame remedy: That
the election of one King was a precedent for the election
of another; and the government, by that means, would
<PB N="302" REF="384">
either degenerate into a republic, or what was wor&s;e,
into a turbulent and &s;editious Monarchy: That the ca&s;e
was &s;till more dangerous, if there remained a Prince,
who claimed the crown by right of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, and di&s;|puted,
on &s;o plau&s;ible a ground, the title of the pre&s;ent
Sovereign: That tho' the doctrine of non-re&s;i&s;tance
might not, in every po&s;&s;ible circum&s;tance, be ab&s;olutely
true, yet was the belief of it extremely expedient; and
to e&s;tabli&s;h a government, which &s;hould have the con|trary
principle for its ba&s;is, was to lay the foundation of
perpetual revolutions and convul&s;ions: That the appoint|ment
of a regent was indeed expo&s;ed to many inconve|niencies;
but &s;o long as the line of &s;ucce&s;&s;ion was pre|&s;erved
entire, there was &s;till a pro&s;pect of putting an end
&s;ome time or other, to the public di&s;orders: And that
scarce any in&s;tance occurred in hi&s;tory, e&s;pecially in the
Engli&s;h hi&s;tory, where a di&s;puted title had not in the i&s;&s;ue,
been attended with much greater ills, than all tho&s;e,
which the people had &s;ought to &s;hun, by departing from
the lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;or.</P>
<P>THE leaders of the whig-party, on the other hand,
a&s;&s;erted, that, if there was any ill in the precedent, that
ill would re&s;ult as much from the e&s;tabli&s;hing a regent,
as from the dethroning one King, and appointing his
&s;ucce&s;&s;or; nor would the one expedient, if wantonly
and ra&s;hly embraced by the people, be le&s;s the &s;ource of
public convul&s;ions than the other: That if the laws
gave no expre&s;s permi&s;&s;ion to depo&s;e the Sovereign, nei|ther
did they authorize the re&s;i&s;ting his authority, or &s;e|parating
the power from the title: That a regent was
unknown, except where the Prince, by rea&s;on of his
tender age or his infirmities, was incapable of a will;
and in that ca&s;e, his will was &s;uppo&s;ed to be involved in
that of the regent: That it would be the height of ab|&s;urdity
to try a man for acting upon a commi&s;&s;ion, re|ceived
from a Prince, whom we our&s;elves acknowledge
<PB N="303" REF="385">
to be the lawful Sovereign; and no jury would decide &s;o
contrary both to law and to common &s;en&s;e, as to con|demn
&s;uch a criminal: That even the pro&s;pect of being
delivered from this mon&s;trons inconvenience was, in the
pre&s;ent &s;ituation of things, more di&s;tant, than that of
putting an end to a di&s;puted &s;ucce&s;&s;ion: That allowing
the young Prince to be the legitimate heir, he had been
carried abroad; he would be educated in principles de|&s;tructive
of the con&s;titution and e&s;tabli&s;hed religion;
and he would probably leave a &s;on, liable to the &s;ame
in&s;uperable objection: That if the whole line were cut
off by law, the people would in time forget or neglect
their claim; an advantage, which could not be hoped
for, while the admini&s;tration was conducted in their
name, and while they were &s;till acknowledged to po&s;&s;e&s;s
the legal title: And that a nation thus perpetually go|verned
by regents or protectors approached much nearer
to a republic than one &s;ubject to Monarchs, who&s;e he|reditary
regular &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, as well as pre&s;ent authority,
was fixed and appointed by the people.</P>
<P>THIS que&s;tion was agitated with great zeal by the op|po&s;ite
parties in the Hou&s;e of Peers. The chief &s;peakers
among the Tories were Clarendon, Roche&s;ter, and Not|tingham;
among the Whigs, Halifax and Danby. The
que&s;tion was carried for a King by two voices only,
fifty-one again&s;t forty-nine. All the prelates, except
two, the bi&s;hops of London and Bri&s;tol, voted for a re|gent.
The primate, a di&s;intere&s;ted but pu&s;illanimous
man, kept at a di&s;tance, both from the Prince's court
and from Parliament.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;e of Peers proceeded next to examine piece|meal
the vote, &s;ent up to them by the Commons. They
debated, &startq;Whether there was an original contract be|tween
King and people,&endq; and the affirmative was
carried by fifty-three again&s;t forty-&s;ix; a proof that the
Tories were already lo&s;ing ground. The next que&s;tion
<PB N="302" REF="386">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="303" REF="387">
<GAP DESC="DUPLICATE" EXTENT="1 page">
<PB N="304" REF="388">
was, &startq;Whether King James had broke that original con|tract?&endq;
and after a &s;light oppo&s;ition, the affirmative
prevailed. The Lords proceeded to take into con&s;idera|tion
the word, <HI>abdicated;</HI> and it was carried that <HI>de&s;erted</HI>
was more proper. The concluding que&s;tion was, &startq;Whe|ther
King James, having broke the original contract
and <HI>de&s;erted</HI> the government, the throne was thereby va|cant?&endq;
This que&s;tion was debated with more heat and
contention than any of the former; and upon a divi&s;ion,
the Tories prevailed by eleven voices, and it was carried
to omit the la&s;t article with regard to the vacancy of the
throne. The vote was &s;ent back to the Commons with
the&s;e amendments.</P>
<P>THE earl of Danby had embraced the project of be|&s;towing
the Crown &s;olely upon the Prince&s;s of Orange,
and of admitting her as hereditary legal &s;ucce&s;&s;or to
King James: Pa&s;&s;ing by the infant Prince as illegitimate
or &s;uppo&s;ititious. His change of party in the la&s;t que&s;|tion
gave the Tories &s;o con&s;iderable a majority in the num|ber
of voices.</P>
<P>THE Commons &s;till in&s;i&s;ted on their vote,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Free $on|ferences betwixt the Hou&s;es.</NOTE> and &s;ent
up rea&s;ons, why the Lords &s;hould depart from their
amendments. The Lords were not convinced; and it
was nece&s;&s;ary to have a free conference, in order to &s;ettle
this controver&s;y. Never national debate &s;urely was more
important, nor managed by more able &s;peakers; yet is
one &s;uprized to find the topics, in&s;i&s;ted on by both &s;ides,
&s;o very frivolous; more re&s;embling the verbal di&s;putes
of the &s;chools than the &s;olid rea&s;onings of &s;tate&s;men and
legi&s;lators. In public tran&s;actions of &s;uch con&s;equence,
the true motives, which produce any mea&s;ure, are &s;el|dom
avowed. The Whigs, now the ruling party, hav|ing
united with the Tories, in order to bring about the
revolution, had &s;o much deference for their new allies,
as not to in&s;i&s;t, that the Crown &s;hould be declared <HI>for|feited,</HI>
on account of the King's mal-admini&s;tration:
<PB N="305" REF="389">
Such a declaration, they thought, would imply too ex|pre&s;s
a cen&s;ure of the old tory principles, and too open
a preference of their own. They agreed therefore to
confound together the King's abu&s;ing his power and his
withdrawing from the kingdom; and they called the
whole an <HI>abdication;</HI> as if he had given a virtual, tho'
not a verbal, con&s;ent to his dethronement. The Tories
took advantage of this obvious impropriety, which had
been occa&s;ioned merely by the complai&s;ance or prudence
of the Whigs; and they in&s;i&s;ted upon the word, <HI>de&s;er|tion,</HI>
as much more &s;ignificant and intelligible. It was
retorted on them, that, however that expre&s;&s;ion might be
ju&s;tly applied to the King's withdrawing him&s;elf, it could
not, with any propriety, be extended to his violation of
the fundamental laws. And thus both parties, while
they warped their principles from regard to their antago|ni&s;ts,
and from prudential con&s;iderations, lo&s;t the pr&aacute;i&s;e
of con&s;i&s;tence and uniformity.</P>
<P>THE managers for the Lords next in&s;i&s;ted, that even al|lowing
the King's abu&s;e of power to be equivalent to an
abdication, or in other words, to a civil death, it could
operate no otherwi&s;e than his voluntary re&s;ignation or
his natural death; and could only make way for the next
&s;ucce&s;&s;or. It was a maxim of Engli&s;h law, <HI>that the throne
was never vacant;</HI> but in&s;tantly upon the decea&s;e of one
King was filled with his legal heir, who was entitled to
all the authority of his predece&s;&s;or. And however young
or unfit for government the &s;ucce&s;&s;or, however unfortu|nate
in his &s;ituation, tho' he were even a captive in the
hands of public enemies; yet no ju&s;t rea&s;on, they
thought, could be a&s;&s;igned, why, without any default of
his own, he &s;hould lo&s;e a crown, to which, by birth,
he was fully intitled. The managers of the Commons
might have oppo&s;ed this rea&s;oning by many &s;pecious
and even &s;olid arguments. They might have &s;aid, that
the great &s;ecurity for allegiance being merely opinion,
<PB N="306" REF="390">
any &s;cheme of &s;ettlement &s;hould be adopted, in which,
it was mo&s;t probable, the people would acquie&s;ce and
per&s;evere. That tho' upon the natural death of one
King, who&s;e admini&s;tration had been agreeable to the
laws, many and great inconveniencies would be endured
rather than exclude his lineal &s;ucce&s;&s;or; yet the ca&s;e
was not the &s;ame, when the people had been obliged, by their
revolt, to dethrone a Prince, who&s;e illegal mea&s;ures had,
in every circum&s;tance, violated the con&s;titution. That
in the&s;e extraordinary revolutions, the government re|turned
to its fir&s;t principles, and the community acquired
a right of providing for the public intere&s;t by expedients,
which, on other occa&s;ions, might be deemed violent and
irregular. That the recent u&s;e of one extraordinary re|medy
familiarized the people to the practice of another,
and more reconciled their minds to &s;uch licences than
if the government had run on in its u&s;ual tenor. And
that King James, having carried abroad his &s;on, as well
as withdrawn him&s;elf, had given &s;uch ju&s;t provocation
to the kingdom, had voluntarily involved it in &s;uch diffi|culties,
that the intere&s;ts of his family were ju&s;tly &s;acri|ficed
to the public &s;ettlement and tranquillity. Tho'
the&s;e topics &s;eem rea&s;onable, they were intirely forborne
by the whig managers; both becau&s;e they implied an
acknowledgment of the infant Prince's legitimacy,
which, it was agreed, to keep in ob&s;curity, and becau&s;e
they contained too expre&s;s a condemnation of tory prin|ciples.
They were contented to maintain the vote of
the Commons by &s;hifts and eva&s;ions; and both &s;ides
parted at la&s;t without coming to any agreement.</P>
<P>BUT it was impo&s;&s;ible for the public to remain long in
the pre&s;ent &s;ituation. The per&s;everance, therefore, of
the Lower Hou&s;e obliged the Lords to comply; and by
the de&s;ertion of &s;ome Peers to the Whig party, the vote
of the Commons, without any alteration, pa&s;&s;ed by a
&s;mall majority in the Upper Hou&s;e, and received the
<PB N="307" REF="391">
&s;anction of every part of the legi&s;lature, which then &s;ub|&s;i&s;ted.</P>
<P>IT happens unluckily for tho&s;e, who maintain an ori|ginal
contract between the magi&s;trate and people, that
great revolutions of government, and new &s;ettlements
of civil con&s;titutions, are commonly conducted with &s;uch
violence, tumult and di&s;order, that the public voice can
&s;carce ever be heard; and the opinions of the citizens are
at that time le&s;s attended to than even in the common
cour&s;e of admini&s;tration. The pre&s;ent tran&s;actions in
England, it mu&s;t be confe&s;&s;ed, are a very &s;ingular excep|tion
to this ob&s;ervation. The new elections had been
carried on with great tranquillity and freedom: The
Prince had ordered the troops to depart from all the
towns, where the voters a&s;&s;embled: A tumultuary pe|tition
to the two Hou&s;es having been promoted, he took
care, tho' the petition was calculated for his own advan|tage,
effectually to &s;uppre&s;s it: He entered into no in|trigues,
either with the electors or the members: He
kept him&s;elf in a total &s;ilence, as if he had been no wi&s;e
concerned in the&s;e tran&s;actions: And &s;o far from form|ing
cabals with the leaders of parties, he di&s;dained even
to be&s;tow care&s;&s;es on tho&s;e, who&s;e a&s;&s;i&s;tance might be u&s;e|ful
to him. This conduct was highly meritorious, and
discovered great moderation and magnanimity; even tho'
the Prince unfortunately, thro' the whole cour&s;e of his
life, and on every occa&s;ion, was noted for an addre&s;s &s;o
cold, dry, and di&s;tant, that it was very difficult for him,
on account of any intere&s;t, to &s;often or familiarize it.</P>
<P>AT la&s;t, the Prince deigned to break &s;ilence, and to
expre&s;s, tho' in a private manner, his &s;entiments on the
pre&s;ent &s;ituation of affairs. He called together Halifax,
Shrew&s;bury, Danby, and a few more; and he told them,
that having been invited over to re&s;tore their liberty, he
had engaged in this enterprize, and had at la&s;t happily
effected his purpo&s;e: That it belonged to the Parliament,
<PB N="308" REF="392">
now cho&s;en and a&s;&s;embled with freedom, to concert
mea&s;ures for the public &s;ettlement; and he pretended not
to interpo&s;e in their determinations. That he heard of &s;e|veral
&s;chemes propo&s;ed for e&s;tabli&s;hing the government;
Some in&s;i&s;ted on a regent; others were de&s;irous of be|&s;towing
the Crown on the Prince&s;s: It was their concern
alone to choo&s;e that plan of admini&s;tration which was
mo&s;t agreeable or advantageous to them. That if they
cho&s;e to &s;ettle a regent, he had no objection: He only
thought it incumbent on him to inform them, that he
was determined not to be the regent, nor ever to engage
in a &s;cheme, which, he knew, would be expo&s;ed to &s;uch
in&s;uperable difficulties. That no man could have a ju&s;ter
or deeper &s;en&s;e of the Prince&s;s's merit than he was im|pre&s;&s;ed
with; but he would rather remain a private per|&s;on
than enjoy a crown, which mu&s;t depend on the will
or life of another. And that they mu&s;t therefore make ac|count,
if they were inclined to either of the&s;e two plans
of &s;ettlement, that it would be totally out of his power
to a&s;&s;i&s;t them in carrying it into execution: His affairs
abroad were too important to be abandoned for &s;o pre|carious
a dignity, or even to allow him &s;o much leizure
as would be requi&s;ite to introduce order into their di&s;|jointed
government.</P>
<P>THESE views of the prince were &s;econded by the Prin|ce&s;s
her&s;elf, who, as &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed many virtues, was
a mo&s;t ob&s;equious wife to a hu&s;band, who, in the judg|ment
of the generality of her &s;ex, would have appeared
&s;o little attractive and amiable. All con&s;iderations were
neglected, when they came in competition with what
&s;he deemed her duty to the Prince. When Danby and
others of her partizans wrote her an account of their
&s;chemes and proceedings, &s;he expre&s;&s;ed great di&s;plea&s;ure;
and even tran&s;mitted their letters to her hu&s;band, as a
&s;acrifice to conjugal fidelity. The Prince&s;s Anne al&s;o
concurred in the &s;ame plan for the public &s;ettlement;
<PB N="309" REF="393">
and being promi&s;ed an ample revenue, was contented to
he po&s;tponed in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ion to the crown. And as the
title of her infant brother, in the pre&s;ent e&s;tabli&s;hment,
was entirely neglected, &s;he might, on the whole, e&s;teem
her&s;elf, in point of intere&s;t, a great gainer by this revo|lution.</P>
<P>ALL parties, therefore, being agreed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Settlement of the crown.</NOTE> the Convention
pa&s;&s;ed a bill, where they &s;ettled the Crown on the Prince
and Prince&s;s of Orange, the &s;ole Admini&s;tration to re|main
in the Prince: The Prince&s;s of Denmark to &s;ucceed
after the death of the Prince and Prince&s;s of Orange;
her po&s;terity after tho&s;e of the Prince&s;s, but before tho&s;e
of the Prince by any other wife. The Convention an|nexed
to this &s;ettlement of the crown a declaration of
rights, where all the points, which had, of late years,
been di&s;puted between King and people, were finally de|termined;
and the powers of royal prerogative were
more narrowly circum&s;cribed and more exactly defined,
than in any former period of the Engli&s;h government.</P>
<P>THUS we have &s;een, thro' the cour&s;e of four reigns,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Manners, arts, and &s;ciences,</NOTE> a
continued &s;truggle maintained between the crown and the
people: Privilege and Prerogative were ever at variance:
And both parties, be&s;ide the pre&s;ent object of di&s;pute, had
many latent claims, which, on a favourable occa&s;ion,
they produced again&s;t their adver&s;aries. Governments
too &s;teady and uniform, as they are &s;eldom free, &s;o are
they, in the judgment of &s;ome, attended with another
&s;en&s;ible inconvenience: They abate the active powers of
men; depre&s;s courage, invention, and genius; and pro|duce
<PB N="310" REF="394">
an univer&s;al lethargy in the people. Tho' this
opinion may be ju&s;t, the fluctuation and conte&s;t, it mu&s;t
be allowed, of the Engli&s;h government were, during the&s;e
reigns, much too violent both for the repo&s;e and &s;afety
of the people. Foreign affairs, at that time, were either
entirely neglected, or managed to pernicious purpo&s;es:
And in the dome&s;tic admini&s;tration there was felt a con|tinued
fever, either &s;ecret or manife&s;t; &s;ometimes the
mo&s;t furious convul&s;ions and di&s;orders. The revolution
forms a new epoch in the con&s;titution; and was attended
with con&s;equences much more advantageous to the peo|ple,
than the barely freeing them from a bad admini&s;tra|tion.
By deciding many important que&s;tions in favour
of liberty, and &s;till more, by that great precedent of de|po&s;ing
one King, and e&s;tabli&s;hing a new family, it gave
&s;uch an a&s;cendant to popular principles, as has put the
nature of the Engli&s;h constitution beyond all controver&s;y.
And it may &s;afely be affirmed, without any danger of
exaggeration, that we in this i&s;land have ever &s;ince en|joyed,
if not the be&s;t &s;y&s;tem of government, at lea&s;t the
mo&s;t entire &s;y&s;tem of liberty, that ever was known
among&s;t mankind.</P>
<P>TO decry with &s;uch violence, as is affected by &s;ome,
the whole line of Stuart; to maintain, that their admi|ni&s;tration
was one continued encroachment on the <HI>incon|testible</HI>
rights of the people; is not giving due honour
to that great event, which not only put a period to their
hereditary &s;ucce&s;&s;ion, but made a new &s;ettlement of
the whole con&s;titution. The inconveniencies, &s;uffered by
the people under the two fir&s;t reigns of that family (for
in the main they were pro&s;perous) proceeded in a great
mea&s;ure from the unavoidable &s;ituation of affairs; and
&s;carce any thing could have prevented tho&s;e events, but
&s;uch vigour of genius in the Sovereign, attended with
&s;uch good fortune, as might have enabled him entirely to
overpower the liberties of his people. While the Parlia|ments,
<PB N="311" REF="395">
in the&s;e reigns, were taking advantage of the ne|ce&s;&s;ities
of the Prince, and attempting every &s;e&s;&s;ion to
aboli&s;h, or circum&s;cribe, or define, &s;ome prerogative of
the Crown, and innovate in the u&s;ual tenor of govern|ment:
Mu&s;t it not be expected, that the Prince would
defend an authority, which, for above a century, that
is, during the whole regular cour&s;e of the for|mer
Engli&s;h government, had been exerci&s;ed with|out
di&s;pute or controver&s;y? And tho' Charles the
&s;econd, in 1672, may with rea&s;on be deemed the
aggre&s;&s;or, nor is it po&s;&s;ible to ju&s;tify his conduct; yet
were there &s;ome motives &s;urely, which could engage a
Prince, &s;o &s;oft and indolent, and at the &s;ame time, &s;o
judicious, to attempt &s;uch hazardous enterprizes. He
felt, that public affairs had reached a &s;ituation, at which
they could not po&s;&s;ibly remain, without &s;ome farther in|novation.
Frequent Parliaments were become almo&s;t
entirely nece&s;&s;ary to the conduct of public bu&s;ine&s;s; yet
the&s;e a&s;&s;emblies were &s;till, in the judgment of the Roy|ali&s;ts,
much inferior in dignity to the Sovereign, whom
they &s;eemed better calculated to council than controul.
The Crown &s;till po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed con&s;iderable power of oppo&s;ing
Parliaments; and had not as yet acquired the means of
influencing them. Hence a continued jealou&s;y between
the&s;e parts of the con&s;titution: Hence the inclination
mutually to take advantage of each other's nece&s;&s;ities:
Hence the impo&s;&s;ibility under which the King lay of find|ing
mini&s;ters, who could at once be &s;erviceable and
faithful to him. If he followed his own choice in ap|pointing
his &s;ervants, without regard to their parliamen|tary
intere&s;t, a refractory &s;e&s;&s;ion was in&s;tantly to be ex|pected:
If he cho&s;e them from among the leaders of po|pular
a&s;&s;emblies, they either lo&s;t their influence by ad|hering
to the Crown, or they betrayed the Crown, in
order to pre&s;erve their influence with the people. Nei|ther
Hambden, whom Charles the fir&s;t was willing to
<PB N="312" REF="396">
gain at any price; nor Shafte&s;bury, whom Charles the
&s;econd, after the popi&s;h plot, attempted to engage in his
councils, would renounce their popularity for the preca|rious,
and, as they e&s;teemed it, deceitful favour of the
Prince. The root of their authority they &s;till thought
to lye in the Parliament; and as the power of that a&s;|&s;embly
was not yet uncontrouleable, they &s;till re&s;olved
to augment it, tho' at the expence of the royal preroga|tives.</P>
<P>'TIS no wonder, that the&s;e events, by the repre&s;enta|tions
of faction, have long been extremely clouded and
ob&s;cured. No man has yet aro&s;e, who has been en|abled
to pay an entire regard to truth, and has dared to
expo&s;e her, without covering or di&s;gui&s;e, to the eyes of
the prejudiced public. Even that party among&s;t us,
who boa&s;t of the highe&s;t regard to liberty, have not po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed
&s;ufficient liberty of thought in this particular; nor
have been able to decide impartially of their own merit
compared with that of their antagoni&s;ts. More noble
undoubtedly in their ends, and more beneficial to man|kind;
they mu&s;t al&s;o be allowed to have been often le&s;s
ju&s;tifiable in the means, and in many of their tran&s;actions
to have payed more regard to political than to moral
con&s;iderations. Being obliged to court the populace,
they found it nece&s;&s;ary to comply with their rage and
folly; and have even, on many occa&s;ions, by propagat|ing
fictions, by promoting violence, &s;erved to infatuate,
as well as corrupt that people, to whom they made a
tender of liberty and ju&s;tice. Charles the fir&s;t was a
tyrant, a Papi&s;t, and a contriver of the Iri&s;h ma&s;&s;acre:
The church of England was relpa&s;ing fa&s;t into idolatry:
Puritani&s;m was the only true religion, and the covenant
the favourite object of heavenly regard. Thro' the&s;e de|lu&s;ions
the party proceeded, and, what may &s;eem more
wonderful, &s;till to the encrea&s;e of law and liberty; 'till
they reached the impo&s;ture of the popi&s;h plot, a fiction
<PB N="313" REF="397">
which exceeds the ordinary bounds of vulgar credulity.
But however &s;ingular the&s;e events may appear, there is
really nothing altogether new in any period of modern
hi&s;tory: And it is remarkable, that tribunitian arts, tho'
&s;ometimes u&s;eful in a free con&s;titution, have often been
&s;uch as men of &s;trict probity and honour could not bring
them&s;elves either to practice or approve. The other fac|tion,
who, &s;ince the revolution, have been obliged to
court the populace, &s;ometimes found it requi&s;ite to em|ploy
like artifices.</P>
<P>THE whig party, for a cour&s;e of near &s;eventy years,
have, almo&s;t without interruption, enjoyed the whole
authority of the government; and no honours nor offices
could be obtained but by their countenance and protec|tion.
But this event, which has been advantageous to
the &s;tate, has been de&s;tructive to the truth of hi&s;tory,
and has e&s;tabli&s;hed many gro&s;s fal&s;hoods, which it is
unaccountable how any civilized nation could have em|braced
with regard to its dome&s;tic occurrences. Com|po&s;itions
ths mo&s;t de&s;picable, both for &s;tyle and matter,
have been extolled, and propagated, and read; as if
they had equalled the mo&s;t celebrated remains of anti|quity.
And becau&s;e the ruling party had obtained an
advantage over their antagoni&s;ts in the philo&s;ophical di&s;|putes
concerning &s;ome of their general principles, they
thence a&s;&s;umed a right to impo&s;e on the public their ac|count
of all particular tran&s;actions, and to repre&s;ent the
other party as governed entirely by the lowe&s;t and mo&s;t
vulgar prejudices. But extremes of all kinds are to be
avoided; and tho' no one will ever plea&s;e either faction
by moderate opinions, it is there we are mo&s;t likely to
meet with truth and cetainty.</P>
<P>WE &s;hall &s;ubjoin to this general view of the Engli&s;h
government, &s;ome account of the &s;tate of the finances,
arms, trade, manners, arts, between the re&s;toration and

THE revenue of Charles the &s;econd, as &s;ettled by the
long Parliament, was put upon a very bad footing. It
was too &s;mall, if they intended to make him indepen|dant
in the common cour&s;e of his admini&s;tration: It
was too large, and &s;ettled during too long a period, if
they re&s;olved to keep him in entire dependance. The large
debts of the republic, which were thrown upon that
Prince, the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;upplying the naval and military
&s;tores, which were entirely exhau&s;ted<NOTE N="a" PLACE="foot">Lord Clarendon's &s;peech to the Parliament, Oct. 9, 1665.</NOTE>; that of repair|ing
and furni&s;hing his palaces: All the&s;e cau&s;es involved
the King in great difficulties immediately after his re&s;to|ration;
and the Parliament were not &s;ufficiently liberal
in &s;upplying him. Perhaps too he had contracted &s;ome
debts abroad; and his bounty to the di&s;tre&s;&s;ed cavaliers,
tho' it did not corre&s;pond either to their &s;ervices or ex|pectations,
could not fail, in &s;ome degree, to exhau&s;t
his trea&s;ures. The extraordinary &s;ums, granted the
King during the fir&s;t years, did not &s;uffice for the&s;e ex|traordinary
charges; and the exci&s;e and cu&s;toms, the only
con&s;tant revenue, amounted not to nine hundred thou|sand
pounds a year, and fell very much &s;hort of the or|dinary
charges of the government. The addition of
hearth-money in 1662, and of the other two branches
in 1669 and 1670, brought up the revenue to one mil|lion
three hundred fifty-eight thou&s;and pounds, as we
learn from lord trea&s;urer Danby's account: But the

becau&s;e a&s;&s;erted. by all cotemporary authors of
both parties, and even confe&s;&s;ed by him&s;elf, that King
Charles was &s;omewhat profu&s;e and negligent. But it is
likewi&s;e certain, that a very rigid frugality was requi&s;ite
to &s;upport the government under &s;uch difficulties. There
is a familiar rule in all bu&s;ine&s;s, that every, man &s;hould
be payed, in proportion to the tru&s;t repo&s;ed in him, and
to the power, which he enjoys; and the nation &s;oon
found rea&s;on, from Charles's dangerous connexions with
France, to repent their tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of that prudential
maxim.</P>
<P>IF we e&s;timate the ordinary revenue of Charles the &s;e|cond
at one million two hundred thou&s;and pounds a year
during his whole reign, the computation with rather ex|ceed
than fall under the, true value. The Convention
Parliament, after all the &s;ums, which they had granted the
King towards the payment of old debts, threw, the la&s;t
day of their meeting, a debt upon him, amounting to
one million &s;even hundred forty-three thou&s;and two hun|dred
&s;ixty-three pounds<NOTE N="d" PLACE="foot">Journals, 29th of December, 1660.</NOTE>. All the extraordinary &s;ums,
which were afterwards voted him by Parliament, amount|ed
to eleven millions four hundred forty-three thou&s;and
four hundred and &s;even pounds; which divided by
twenty-four, the number of years, which that King
reigned, make four hundred &s;eventy-&s;ix thou&s;and eight
hundred and eight pounds a year. During that time, he
had two violent wars to &s;u&s;tain with the Dutch; and in
1678, he made expen&s;ive preparations for a war with
France. In the fir&s;t Dutch war, both France and Den|mark
were allies to the United Provinces, and the naval armaments
in England were very great; &s;o that it is im|po&s;&s;ible
<PB N="316" REF="402">
he could have &s;ecreted any part, at lea&s;t any con|&s;iderable
part, of the &s;ums, which were then voted him
by: Parliament.</P>
<P>To the&s;e &s;ums we mu&s;t add about one million two
hundred thou&s;and pounds, which had been detained from
the bankers on &s;hutting up the Exchequer in 1672. The
King payed &s;ix per cent. for this money during all the
re&s;t of his reign<NOTE N="e" PLACE="foot">Danby's Memoirs, p. 7.</NOTE>. It is remarkable, that, notwith|&s;tanding
this violent breach of faith, the King, two
years after, borrowed money at eight per cent; the &s;ame
rate of intere&s;t, which he had payed before that event<NOTE N="f" PLACE="foot">Id. p. 65.</NOTE>.
A proof, that public credit, in&s;tead of being of &s;o de|licate
a nature, as we are apt to imagine, is, in reality, &s;o
hardy and rou&s;t, that it is very difficult to de&s;troy it.</P>
<P>THE revenue of James was rai&s;ed by the Parliament
to about one million eight hundred fifty thou&s;and pounds<NOTE N="g" PLACE="foot">Journ. 1&s;t of March, 1689.</NOTE>;
and his income as Duke of York being added, made the
whole amount to two millions a year; a &s;um well pro|portioned

in too independent a manner. The national debt at the
revolution amounted to one million fifty-four thou&s;and
nine hundred twenty-five pounds<NOTE N="h" PLACE="foot">Journ. 20th of March, 1689.</NOTE>.</P>
<P>THE militia fell much to decay during the&s;e two reigns,
partly by the policy of the Kings, who had entertained
a diffidence of their &s;ubjects, partly by that ill judged
law, which limited the King's power of mu&s;tering and
arraying them. In the beginning, however, of Charles's
reign, the militia were &s;till deemed formidable. De
Wit having propo&s;ed to the French King an inva&s;ion of
England during the fir&s;t Dutch war, that Monarch re|plied,
that &s;uch an attempt would be entirely fruitle&s;s,
and would tend only to unite the Engli&s;h. In a few

<P><PB N="317" REF="403">
CHARLES in the beginning of his reign had in pay near
five thou&s;and men, of guards and garri&s;ons. At the end
of his reign, he augmented this number to near eight
thou&s;and. James on Monmouth's rebellion had on foot
about fifteen thou&s;and men; and when ths Prince of
Orange invaded him, there were no fewer than thirty
thou&s;and regular troops in England.</P>
<P>THE Engli&s;h navy, during the greate&s;t part of Charles's
reign, made a great figure, for number of &s;hips, valour
of the men, and conduct of the commanders. Even in
1678, the fleet con&s;i&s;ted of eighty-three &s;hips<NOTE N="k" PLACE="foot">Pepys's Memoirs, p. 4.</NOTE>; be&s;ides
thirty, which were at that, time on the &s;tocks. On the
King's acce&s;&s;ion he found only &s;ixty-three ve&s;&s;els of all
&s;izes<NOTE N="l" PLACE="foot">Memoirs of Engli&s;h affairs, chiefly naval.</NOTE>. During the latter part of Charles's reign, the
navy fell con&s;iderably to decay, by rea&s;on of the narrow|ne&s;s

acce&s;&s;ion, re&s;tored it to its former power and glory; and
before he left the throne, carried it much father. The

as a model for order and economy. The fleet at

not to mention O&s;&s;ory, &s;erved on board the fleet,
and were pre&s;ent in the mo&s;t furious engagements again&s;t
the Dutch.</P>
<P>THE commerce and riches of England did never, du|ring
any period, increa&s;e &s;o fa&s;t as from the re&s;toration
to the revolution. The two Dutch wars, by di&s;turbing
the trade of that republic, promoted the navigation of
this i&s;land; and after Charles had made a &s;eparate peace
<PB N="318" REF="404">
with the States, his &s;ubjects enjoyed unmole&s;ted the
trade of Europe. The only di&s;turbance, which they
met with, was from a few French privateers, who in|fe&s;ted
the channel; and Charles interpo&s;ed not in behalf
of his &s;ubjects with &s;ufficient &s;pirit and vigour. The
recovery or conque&s;t of New York and the Jer&s;eys was
a very con&s;iderable acce&s;&s;ion to the &s;trength and &s;ecurity
of the Engli&s;h colonies; and, together with the &s;ettle|ment
of Pen&s;ilvania and Carolina, which was effected
during this reign, extended prodigiou&s;ly the Engli&s;h em|pire
in America. The per&s;ecutions of the Di&s;&s;enters,
or more properly &s;peaking, the re&s;traints impo&s;ed upon
them, contributed to augment and people the&s;e colonies.
Dr. Davenant affirms<NOTE N="n" PLACE="foot">Di&s;cour&s;e on the public revenues, part ii. P. 29, 33, 36.</NOTE> that the &s;hipping of England
doubled during the&s;e twenty-eight years. Several new
manufactures were e&s;tabli&s;hed; in iron, bra&s;s, &s;ilk, hats,
gla&s;s, &amp;c. One Brewer, leaving the Low Countries, when
they were threatened with a French conque&s;t, brought the
art of dying woollen cloth into England, and by that im|provement
&s;aved the nation great &s;ums of money. The
encrea&s;e of coynage during the&s;e two reigns was ten
millions two hundred &s;ixty-one thon&s;and pounds. A
board of trade was erected in 1670; and the earl of
Sandwich was made president. Charles revived and &s;up|ported
the charter of the Ea&s;t-India company; a mea|&s;ure
whole utility is &s;omewhat doubtful: He granted a
charter to the Hud&s;on's Bay company; a mea&s;ure evi|dently
hurtful.</P>
<P>THE French King, about the beginning of Charles's
reign, laid &s;ome impositions on Engli&s;h commodities:
And the Engli&s;h, partly di&s;plea&s;ed with this innovation,
partly moved by their animo&s;ity again&s;t France, retalio|ated,
by laying &s;uch re&s;traints on the commerce with
that kingdom as amounted almo&s;t to a prohibition. They
<PB N="319" REF="405">
formed calculations, by which they per&s;waded them&s;elves,
that they were lo&s;ers a million and half or near two mil|lions
a year by the French trade. But no good effects
were found to re&s;ult from the&s;e re&s;traints; and in King
James's reign they were taken off by the Parliament.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time that the burroughs of England were
deprived of their privileges, the like attempt was made
on the colonies. King James recalled their charters, by
which their liberties were &s;ecured; and he &s;ent over go|vernors
inve&s;ted with ab&s;olute power. The arbitrary
principles of that Monarch appeared in every part of his
admini&s;tration.</P>
<P>THE people, during the&s;e two reigns, were, in a
great mea&s;ure, cured of that wild fanatici&s;m, by which
they had formerly been &s;o much agitated. Whatever
new vices they might acquire, it may be que&s;tioned,
whether, by this change, they were, in the main, much
lo&s;ers in point of morals. By the example of the King
and the cavaliers, licentiou&s;ne&s;s and debauchery became
very prevalent in the nation. The plea&s;ures of the table
were much pur&s;ued. Love was treated, more as an ap|petite
than a pa&s;&s;ion. The one &s;ex began to abate of
the national, character of cha&s;tity, without being able
to in&s;pire the other with &s;entiment or delicacy.</P>
<P>THE abu&s;es in the former age, ari&s;ing from over|&s;trained
preten&s;ions of piety, had much propagated the
&s;pirit of irreligion<NOTE N="o" PLACE="foot"><P>This &s;ophi&s;m, of arguing from the abu&s;e of any thing again&s;t the u&s;e of it, is one of the gro&s;&s;e&s;t; and at the &s;ame time, the mo&s;t common, to which men are &s;ubject. The hi&s;tory, of all ages, and none more than that of the period, which is our &s;ubject, offers us examples of the abu&s;e of religion; and we have not been &s;paring to remark, them: But whoever would thence draw an inference to the di&s;advantage of religion in general, would argue very ra&s;hly and erroneou&s;ly. The proper office of religion is to reform men's lives, to purify their hearts, to inforce all moral duties, and to &s;ecure obedience to, the laws and civil magi&s;trate. While it pur&s;ues the&s;e falutary purpo&s;es, its operations, tho' infinitely valuable, are &s;ecret and &s;ilent, and &s;eldom come under the cognizance of hi&s;tory. That adulterate &s;pecies of it alone, whlch inflames faction, animates &s;edition, and prompts rebe$ion, di&s;tingui&s;hes it&s;elf on the open theatre of the world, and is the great, &s;ource of revolutions and public co$vul&s;ions. The hi&s;torian, therefore, has &s;carce occa&s;ion to mention any other kind of religion; and he may retain the highe&s;t regard, for true piety, even while he expo&s;es all the abu&s;es of the fal&s;e. He may even think, that he cannot better &s;how his attachment to the Former than by detecting the latter, and, laying open its ab&s;urdities and pernicious tendency.</P>
<P>IT is no proof of irreligion in an hi&s;torian, that he remarks &s;ome fault or imperfection in each, &s;ect of religion, which he has occa&s;ion to mention, Every in&s;titution, however divine, which is adopted by men, mu&s;t partake of the weakne&s;s and infirmities of our nature; and will be apt, unle&s;s carefully guarded, to degenerate into one extreme or the other. What &s;pecies of devotion &s;o pure, noble, and worthy, the Supreme Being, as that which is mo&s;t &s;piritual, &s;imple, unadorned, and which partakes nothing either of the &s;en&s;es or imagination? Yet is it found by experience, that this mode of wor&s;hip does very naturally, among the vulgar, mount up into extravagance and fanatici&s;m. Even many of the fir&s;t reformers are expo&s;ed to this reproach; and their zeal, tho' in the event, it proved extremely u&s;eful, partook &s;trongly of the enthu&s;ia&s;tic genius: Two of the judges in the reign of Charles the &s;econd, &s;crupled not to advance this opinion even from the bench. Some mixture ceremony, pomp, and ornament may &s;eem to correct the abu&s;e; yet will it be found very difficult to prevent &s;uch a form of religion from &s;inking &s;ometimes into &s;uper&s;ti&s;ion the church of England it&s;elf, which is perhaps the be&s;t medium among the&s;e extremes, will be allowed, at lea&s;t during the, age of archbi&s;hop La$d, to have been &s;omewhat infected with a &s;uper&s;tition, re&s;embling the popi&s;h; and to have payed a higher regard to &s;ome po&s;itive in&s;titutions, than the nature of the things, &s;trictly &s;peaking, would permit. It is the bu&s;ine&s;s of an hi&s;torian to remark the&s;e abu&s;es of all kinds; but it belongs al&s;o to a prudent reader to confine the repre&s;entations, which he meets with, to that age alone of which the author treats. What ab&s;urdity, for in&s;tance, to &s;uppo&s;e, that the Pre&s;byterians, Independants, Anabapti&s;ts, and other &s;ectaries of the pre&s;ent age, partake of, all the extravagancies, which, we remark in tho&s;e who bore the&s;e appellations in the la&s;t century? The inference indeed &s;eem ju&s;ter; where &s;ects have been noted for fanatici&s;m during one period, to conclude, that they will be very moderate and rea&s;onable in the &s;ub&s;equent. For as it is the nature of fanatici&s;m to aboli&s;h all &s;lavi&s;h &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to prie&s;ts power; it follows that as &s;oon as the fir&s;t ferment is abated, men are $ate rally in &s;uch fects left to the free u&s;e of their rea&s;on, and &s;hake off the fetters of cu&s;tom and authority.</P></NOTE>

<P>THE &s;ame factions, which formerly di&s;tracted the na|tion,
were revived, and exerted them&s;elves in the mo&s;t
ungenerous and unmanly enterprizes again&s;t each other.
King Charles, being in his whole deportment a model
of ea&s;y and gentlemanly behaviour, improved the polite|ne&s;s
of the nation; as much as faction, which of all
things is mo&s;t de&s;tructive to politene&s;s, could po&s;&s;ibly per|mit.
His courtiers were long di&s;tingui&s;hable in England
by their obliging and agreeable manners.</P>
<P>AMIDST the thick cloud of bigotr$ and ignorance,
which over&s;pread the nation, during the Commonwealth
and Protector&s;hip, there were a few &s;edate philo&s;ophers,
who in the retirement of Oxford, cultivated their rea&s;on,
and e&s;tabli&s;hed conferences for the mutual communica|tion
of their di&s;coveries in phy&s;ics and geometry. Wil|kins,
a clergyman, who had married Cromwel's &s;i&s;ter
and was afterwards created bi&s;hop of Che&s;ter, promoted
the&s;e philo&s;ophical conver&s;ations. Immediately after the
re&s;toration, the&s;e men procured a patent, and having
enlarged their number, were denominated the <HI>Royal So|ciety.</HI>
But this patent was all they obtained from the
King. Tho' Charles was a great lover of the &s;ciences,
particularly chymi&s;try and mechanics, he animated them
by his example alone, not by his bounty. His craving
courtiers and mi&s;tre&s;&s;es, by whom he was perpetually &s;ur|rounded,
engro&s;&s;ed all his expence, and left him neither
money nor attention for literary merit. His contempo|porary,
Lewis, who fell &s;hort of the King's genius and
knowledge in this particular, much exceeded him in libe|rality.
Be&s;ides pen&s;ions conferred on learned men
throughout all Europe, his academies were directed by
rules and &s;upported by fallaries: A genero&s;ity, which
does great honour to his memory; and in the eyes of all

the ingenuous part of mankind, will be e&s;teemed art
atonement for many of the errors of his reign. We
may he &s;urprized, that this example &s;hould not be more
followed by Princes; &s;ince it is certain, that that bounty,
&s;o exten&s;ive, &s;o beneficial, and &s;o much celebrated, co&s;t
not that Monarch &s;o great a &s;um as is often conferred on
one &s;ingle, u&s;ele&s;s, overgrown favourite or courtier.</P>
<P>BUT tho' the French academy of &s;ciences was directed,
encouraged, and &s;upported by the Sovereign, there aro&s;e
in England &s;ome men of &s;uperior genius, who were more
than &s;ufficient to ca&s;t the ballance, and who drew on
them&s;elves and on their native country the regard and at|tention
of all Europe. Be&s;ides Wilkins, Wren, Wallis,
eminent mathematicians, Hooke, an accurate ob&s;erver
by micro&s;copes, and Sydenham, the re&s;torer of true phy|&s;ic;
there flouri&s;hed during this period a Boyle and a
Newton; men who trode, with cautious, and there|fore
the more &s;ecure &s;teps, the only road, which leads to
true philo&s;ophy.</P>
<P>BOYLE improved the pneumatic engine, invented by
Otto Guericke, and was thereby enabled to make &s;everal
new and curious experiments on the air as well as on
other bodies: His chymi&s;try is much admired by tho&s;e
acquainted with that art: his hydro&s;tatics contain a
greater mixture of rea&s;oning and invention with experi|ment
than any other of his works; but his rea&s;oning is
&s;till remote from that boldne&s;s and temerity, which had
led a&s;tray &s;o many philo&s;ophers. Boyle was a great par|tizan
of the mechanical philo&s;ophy; a theory, which, by
di&s;covering &s;ome of the &s;ecrets of nature, and allowing us
to imagine the re&s;t, is &s;o agreeable to the natural vanity
and curio&s;ity of men.</P>
<P>IN Newton this i&s;land may boa&s;t of having produced the
greate&s;t and rare&s;t genius that ever aro&s;e for the orna|ment
and in&s;truction of the &s;pecies. Cautious, in ad|mitting
no principles but &s;uch as were founded on expe|riment;
<PB N="323" REF="411">
but re&s;olute to adopt every &s;uch principle, how|ever
new or unu&s;ual: From mode&s;ty, ignorant of his &s;u|priority
above the re&s;t of mankind; and thence, le&s;s
careful to accommodate his rea&s;onings to common appre|hen&s;ions:
More anxious to merit than acquire fame: He
was from the&s;e cau&s;es long unknown to the world; but
his reputation at la&s;t broke out with a lu&s;tre, which &s;carce
any writer, during his own life-time, had ever before
attained. While Newton &s;eemed to draw off the veil
from &s;ome of the my&s;teries of nature, he &s;hewed at the
&s;ame time the imperfections of the mechanical philo&s;ophy;
and thereby re&s;tored her ultimate &s;ecrets to that ob&s;curity,
in which they ever did and ever will remain.</P>
<P>THIS age was far from being &s;o favourable to polite
literature as to the &s;ciences. Charles, tho' fond of wit,
tho' po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of a con&s;iderable &s;hare of it, tho'
his ta&s;te of conver&s;ation &s;eems to have been $ound and
ju&s;t; &s;erved rather to corrupt than improve the poetry and
eloquence of his time. When the theatres were opened
at the re&s;toration, and freedom was again given to plea|&s;antry
and ingenuity; men, after &s;o long an ab&s;tinence,
fed on the&s;e delicacies with le&s;s ta&s;te than avidity, and
the coar&s;e&s;t and mo&s;t irregular &s;pecies of wit was received
by the court as well as by the people. The productions
at that time repre&s;ented on the theatre were &s;uch mon|&s;ters
of extravagance and folly; &s;o utterly devoid of
all rea&s;on or even common &s;en&s;e; that they would be
the di&s;grace of Engli&s;h literature, had not the nation made
attonement for its former admiration of them, by the to|tal
oblivion to which they are now condemned. The
duke of Buckingham's Rehear&s;al, which expo&s;ed the&s;e
wild productions, &s;eems to be a piece of ridicule car|ried
to exce&s;s; yet in reality the copy &s;carce equals
&s;ome of the ab&s;urdities, which we meet with in the
originals.</P>
<P><PB N="324" REF="412">
THIS &s;evere &s;atyre, together with the good &s;en&s;e of the
nation, corrected, after &s;ome time, the extravagancies
of the fa&s;hionable wit; but the productions of literature
&s;till wanted much of that correctne&s;s and delicacy, which
we &s;o much admire in the antients, and in the French
writers, their judicious imitators. It was indeed during
this period chiefly, that that nation left the Engli&s;h be|hind
them in the productions of poetry, eloquence, hi&s;|tory,
and other branches of polite letters; and acquired
a &s;uperiority, which the efforts of Engli&s;h writers, during
the &s;ub&s;equent age, did more &s;ucce&s;sfully conte&s;t with
them. The arts and &s;ciences were imported from Italy
into this i&s;land as early as in France; and made at fir&s;t
more &s;urprizing advances. Spencer, Shake&s;pear, Bacon,
John&s;on, were much &s;uperior to their cotemporaries,
who flouri&s;hed in that kingdom. Milton, Waller, Den|ham,
Cowley, Harvey were at lea&s;t equal to their cotem|poraries.
The reign of Charles the &s;econd, which &s;ome
prepo&s;terou&s;ly repre&s;ent as our augu&s;tan age, retarded the
progre&s;s of polite literature in his i&s;land; and it was
then found, that the immea&s;urable licentiou&s;ne&s;s, which
was indulged or rather applauded at court, was more
de&s;tructive to the refined arts than even the cant, non|&s;en&s;e,
and enthu&s;ia&s;m of the preceeding period.</P>
<P>MOST of the celebrated writers of this age remain mo|numents
of genius, perverted by indecency and bad ta&s;te;
but none more than Dryden, both by rea&s;on of the great|ne&s;s
of his talents and the gro&s;s abu&s;e which he made of
them. His plays, excepting a few &s;cenes, are utterly
disfigured by vice or folly or both. His translations ap|pear
too much the offspring of ha&s;te and hunger: Even
his fables are ill cho&s;en tales, conveyed in an incorrect,
tho' &s;pirited ver&s;ification. Yet amid&s;t this great number
of loo&s;e productions, the refu&s;e of our language, there
are found &s;ome &s;mall pieces, his Ode to St. Cecilia, the
<PB N="325" REF="413">
greate&s;t part of Ab&s;alom and Achitophel, and a few more,
which di&s;cover &s;o great genius, &s;uch a richne&s;s of expre&s;|&s;ion,
&s;uch pomp and variety of numbers, that they leave
us equally full of regret and indignation, on account of
the inferiority or rather great ab&s;urdity of his other
writings.</P>
<P>The very name of Roche&s;ter is offen&s;ive to mode&s;t
ears; yet does his poetry di&s;cover &s;uch energy of &s;tyle and
&s;uch poignancy of &s;atyre, as give ground to imagine what
&s;o fine a genius, had he fallen in a more happy age and
had followed better models, was capable of producing.
The antient &s;atyri&s;ts often u&s;ed great liberty in their ex|pre&s;&s;ions;
but their freedom no more re&s;embles the li|cence
of Roche&s;ter, than the nakedne&s;s of an Indian does
that of a common pro&s;titute.</P>
<P>WYCHERLEY was ambitious of the reputation of
wit and libertini&s;m; and he attained it: He was pro|bably
capable of reaching the fame of true comedy,
and in&s;tructive ridicule. Otway had a genius finely
turned to the pathetic: but he neither ob&s;erves &s;trictly
the rules of the drama, nor the rules, &s;till more, e&s;&s;en|tial,
of propriety and decorum. By one &s;ingle piece the
duke of Buckingham did both great &s;ervice to his age and
honour to him&s;elf. The earls of Mulgrave, Dor&s;et, and
Ro&s;common wrote in a good ta&s;te; but their productions
are either feeble or carele&s;s. The marque&s;s of Halifax
di&s;covers a refined genius; and nothing but leizure and
an inferior &s;tation &s;eem wanting to have procured him
great eminence in literature.</P>
<P>OF all the con&s;iderable writers of this age, Sir William
Temple is almo&s;t the only one, who kept him&s;elf altogether,
unpolluted by that inundation of vice and licentiou&s;ne&s;s,
which overwhelmed the nation. The &s;tyle of this au|thor,
tho' extremely negligent, and even mixed with fo|reign
idioms, is agreeable and intere&s;ting. That mix|ture
<PB N="326" REF="414">
of vanity, which appears, in his works, is rather a
recommendation to them. By means of it, we enter into
acquaintance with the character of the author, full of
honour and humanity; and fancy that we are engaged,
not in the peru&s;al of a book, but in conver&s;ation with a
companion.</P>
<P>THO' Hudibras was publi&s;hed, and probably com|po&s;ed,
during Charles the &s;econd's reign, Butler may
ju&s;tly, as well as Milton, be thought to belong to the
foregoing period. No compo&s;ition abounds &s;o much as
Hudibras in &s;trokes of ju&s;t and inimitable wit; yet are
there many performances, which give as great or greater
entertainment on the whole peru&s;al. The allu&s;ions are
often dark and far-fetched; and tho' &s;carce any author
was ever able to expre&s;s his thoughts in &s;o few words, he
often employs too many thoughts on one &s;ubject, and
thereby becomes prolix after an unu&s;ual manner. It is
&s;urprizing how much erudition Butler has introduced with
&s;o good a grace into a work of plea&s;antry and humour;
Hudibras is perhaps one of the mo&s;t learned compo&s;itions,
that is to be found in any language. The advantage,
which the royal cau&s;e received from this poem, in expo|&s;ing
the fanatici&s;m and fal&s;e pretences of the former par|liamentary
party, was prodigious. The king him&s;elf
had &s;o good a ta&s;te as to be highly plea&s;ed with the me|rit
of the work, and had even got a great part of it by
heart: Yet was he either &s;o carele&s;s in his temper, or &s;o
little endowed with the virtue of liberality, or more
properly &s;peaking, of gratitude, that he allowed the au|thor,
who was a man of virtue and probity, to live in
ob&s;curity, and die in want. Dryden is an in&s;tance of a
negligence of the &s;ame kind. His Ab&s;alom &s;en&s;ibly
contributed in the victory, which the Tories obtained
over the Whigs after the exclu&s;ion-parliaments: Yet
could not this merit, aided by his great genius, procure
<PB N="327" REF="415">
him an e&s;tabli&s;hment, which might exempt him from
the nece&s;&s;ity of writing for bread. Otway, tho' a profe&s;t
Royali&s;t, could not eyen procure bread by his writings;
and he had the &s;ingular fate of dying literally of hunger.
The&s;e incidents throw a great &s;tain on the memory
of Charles, who had di&s;cernment, loved genius, was
liberal of money, but attained not the prai&s;e of true
genero&s;ity.</P>
