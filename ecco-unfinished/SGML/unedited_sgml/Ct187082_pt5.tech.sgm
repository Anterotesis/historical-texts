<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Plea&s;ant Adventure.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA was again called upon for her note,
before &s;he had read the letter it was to an&s;wer;
but relieved now from the pre&s;&s;ure of her own
terrifying apprehen&s;ions, &s;he gave it complete and
willing attention.</P>
<P>It contained four &s;ides of paper, clo&s;ely yet ele|gantly
written in the language of romantic &s;enti|ment.
Mrs. Berlinton &s;aid &s;he had &s;pent, as yet,
only a few minutes with her aunt; but they had
been awfully important; and &s;ince &s;he had exacted
from her a promi&s;e to &s;tay the whole day, &s;he
could not deny her di&s;appointed friend&s;hip the
tran&s;ient &s;olace of a paper conver&s;ation, to &s;ooth
the lingering interval of this unexpected ab&s;ence.
&startq;My &s;oul pines to unburden the weight of its
&s;orrows into thy &s;ympathi&s;ing bo&s;om, my gentle&s;t
friend; but oh! there let them not &s;ojourn! receive
but to lighten, li&s;ten but to commi&s;erate, and then,
far, far thence di&s;mi&s;s them, retaining but the re|membrance
thou ha&s;t di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them with con&s;o|lation.&endq;
She then bewailed the time lo&s;t to &s;oft
communication and confidence, in their journey,
from the pre&s;ence of others; for though one was a
brother &s;he &s;o truly loved, &s;he found, notwith|&s;tanding
the tenderne&s;s of his nature, he had the
prejudices of a man upon man's prerogatives, and
her woes called for &s;oothing, not arguments; and
<PB N="2" REF="3">
the other, &s;he briefly added, was but an accidental
pa&s;&s;enger. &startq;'Tis to thee only, O my beauteous
friend! I would tru&s;t the &s;ad murmurs of my irre|ver&s;ible
and mi&s;erable de&s;tiny, of which I have
learnt but this moment the cruel and de&s;perate
&s;ecret cau&s;e.&endq; She re&s;erved, however, the di&s;covery
for their meeting, and called upon her pity for
her unfortunate brother, as deeply involved in his
future views, as &s;he in her pa&s;t, by this my&s;tery:
&startq;And have I written this much,&endq; &s;he bur&s;ts forth,
&startq;without &s;peaking of the cheri&s;hed corre&s;pondent
whom &s;o often I have de&s;cribed to thee? Ah! be|lieve
me not faithle&s;s to that partner of my cho&s;en
e&s;teem, that noble, that re&s;i&s;tle&s;s po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or of my
pure&s;t friend&s;hip! No, charming Camilla, think
not &s;o degradingly of her whom fate, in its &s;ole
pitying interval, has ca&s;t into thy arms.&endq; Two
pages then en&s;ued with his exclu&s;ive encomium,
painting him chief in every virtue, and ma&s;ter of
every grace. She next expre&s;&s;ed her earne&s;tne&s;s to
&s;ee Indiana, who Camilla had told her would be
at Southampton. &startq;Pre&s;ent me, I conjure thee, to
the fair and amiable en&s;laver of my unhappy bro|ther!
I die to &s;ee, to conver&s;e with her, to catch
from her lovely lips the mode&s;t wi&s;dom with which
he tells me they teem; to read in her &s;peaking eyes
the intelligence which he a&s;&s;ures me illumines
them.&endq; She concluded with de&s;iring her to give
what orders &s;he plea&s;ed for the coach, and the &s;er|vants,
and to pa&s;s the day with her friends.</P>
<P>Camilla, who&s;e own &s;en&s;ations were now revived
to happine&s;s, read the letter with all the &s;ympathy
it claimed, and felt her eyes fill with generous tears
at the contra&s;t of their &s;ituations; yet &s;he highly
blamed the tenderne&s;s expre&s;&s;ed for the unknown
corre&s;pondent, though its innocence &s;he was &s;ure
mu&s;t vanqui&s;h even Edgar, &s;ince its &s;o con&s;tant
avowal proved it might be publi&s;hed to all man|kind.
She an&s;wered her in language nearly as af|fectionate,
though le&s;s inflated than her own, and
re&s;olved to &s;upport her with Edgar, till her &s;weet|ne&s;s
<PB N="3" REF="4">
and purity &s;hould need no champions but
them&s;elves. She was a&s;hamed of the &s;pecies of ex|pectation
rai&s;ed for Indiana, yet knew not how to
interfere with Melmond's idea of her capacity,
le&s;t it might &s;eem unkind to repre&s;ent its fallaci|ou&s;ne&s;s;
but &s;he was glad to find her &s;oft friend
&s;eemed to have a &s;trict guardian in her brother;
and wi&s;hed eagerly to communicate to Edgar a
circum&s;tance which &s;he was &s;ure would be &s;o
welcome to him.</P>
<P>Impatient to &s;ee Eugenia, &s;he accepted the offer
of the carriage, and de&s;irous to e&s;cape Mrs. Mittin,
begged to have it immediately; but that notable
per&s;on came to the door at the &s;ame time as the
coach, and, without the &s;malle&s;t ceremony, &s;aid &s;he
would accompany her to the hotel, in order to
take the opportunity of making acquaintance with
her friends.</P>
<P>Courage frequently, at lea&s;t in females, becomes
potent as an agent, where it has been feeble as a
principal. Camilla, though &s;he had wi&s;hed, upon
her own account, to repre&s;s Mrs. Mittin in the
morning, had been too timid for &s;uch an under|taking;
but now, in her anxiety to oblige Edgar,
&s;he gathered re&s;olution for declining her company.
She then found, as is generally the ca&s;e with the
fearful, the ta&s;k le&s;s difficult than &s;he had expected;
for Mrs. Mittin, content with a promi&s;e &s;elf-made,
that the introduction &s;hould take place the next
day, &s;aid &s;he would go and help Mrs. Berlinton's
woman to unpack her lady's things, which would
make a u&s;eful friend for her in the hou&s;e, for a
thou&s;and odd matters.</P>
<P>The carriage of Sir Hugh was ju&s;t driving off
as Camilla arrived at the hotel.</P>
<P>She hurried from Mrs. Berlinton's coach, de|manding
which way the company was gone; and
being an&s;wered, by a pa&s;&s;ing waiter, up &s;tairs, ran
on at once, without patience or thought of a&s;king
if &s;he &s;hould turn to the right or left; till &s;eeing a
gentleman &s;tanding &s;till upon the landing place,
<PB N="4" REF="5">
and leaning upon the banni&s;ters, &s;he was retreating,
to de&s;ire a conductor, when &s;he perceived it was
Dr. Orkborne; who, while the ladies were looking
at accomodations, and inquiring about lodgings,
in profound cogitation, and with his tablets in his
hands, undi&s;turbed by the various noi&s;es around
him, and unmoved by the various &s;pectators con|tinually
pa&s;&s;ing and repa&s;&s;ing, was fini&s;hing a period
which he had begun in the coach for his great
work.</P>
<P>Camilla, cheerfully greeting him, begged to
know which way &s;he &s;hould find Eugema; but,
making her a &s;ign not to &s;peak to him, he wrote
on. Accu&s;tomed to his manner, and brought up
to re&s;pect whatever belonged to &s;tudy, from the
&s;tudious life and turn of her father, &s;he obeyed the
mute injunction, and waited quietly by his &s;ide; till,
tired of the delay, though unwilling to interrupt him,
&s;he glided &s;oftly about the pa&s;&s;age, watching and ex|amining
if &s;he could &s;ee any of the party, yet fearing
to offend or mortify him if &s;he called for a waiter.</P>
<P>While &s;traying about thus, as far off as &s;he could
go without lo&s;ing &s;ight of Dr. Orkborne, a door
&s;he had ju&s;t pa&s;&s;ed was flung open, and &s;he &s;aw
young Halder, who&s;e licentious in&s;olence had &s;o
much alarmed her in the bathing-hou&s;e, &s;troam
out, yawning, &s;tretching, and &s;wearing unmean|ingly,
but mo&s;t di&s;gu&s;tingly, at every &s;tep.</P>
<P>Terrified at his &s;ight, &s;he went on, as &s;he could
not get to the Doctor without pa&s;&s;ing him; but the
youth, recollecting her immediately, called out:
&startq;Ah, ha! are you there again, you little vixen?&endq;
and pur&s;ued her.</P>
<P>&startq;Dr. Orkborne! Dr. Orkborne!&endq; &s;he rather
&s;creamed than &s;aid, &startq;pray come this way! I con|jure&mdash;I
be&s;eech&mdash;I entreat&mdash;Dr. Orkborne!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>The Doctor, catching nothing of this but his
name, querulou&s;ly exclaimed: &startq;You mole&s;t me
much!&endq; but without rai&s;ing his eyes from his tab|lets;
while Halder, at the appeal, cried: &startq;Ay, ay,
<PB N="5" REF="6">
Doctor! keep your di&s;tance, Doctor! you are be&s;t
where you are, Doctor, I can tell you, Doctor!</P>
<P>Camilla, then, too much &s;cared to be aware &s;he
ran a far greater ri&s;k than &s;he e&s;caped, de&s;perately
&s;ought refuge by opening the neare&s;t door: though
by the &s;udden noi&s;es upon the &s;tairs, and in all the
adjoining pa&s;&s;ages, it &s;eemed as if Dr. Orkborne
were the only one not alarmed by her cries.</P>
<P>No one, however, could approach &s;o &s;oon as
the per&s;on of who&s;e chamber &s;he had bur&s;t the
door; who was an old gentleman, of a good and
lively countenance, who promptly pre&s;enting him|&s;elf,
looked at her with &s;ome &s;urpri&s;e, but good-humouredly
a&s;ked her what &s;he was plea&s;ed to
want in his room.</P>
<P>&startq;That gentleman,&endq; &s;he cried, panting and
meaning to point to Dr. Orkborne; &startq;that gentle|man
I want, &s;ir!&endq; but &s;uch a medley of waiters,
company, and &s;ervants, had in a moment a&s;&s;embled
in the &s;pace between them, that the Doctor was
no longer to be di&s;cerned.</P>
<P>&startq;Do you only open my door, then,&endq; &s;aid he,
drily, &startq;to tell me you want &s;omebody el&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>Yet when Halder, vowing he owed her an ill
turn for which &s;he &s;hould pay, would have &s;eized
her by the hand, he protected with his own arm,
&s;aying: &startq;Fie, boy, fie! let the girl alone! I don't
like violence.&endq;</P>
<P>A gentleman now, forcing him&s;elf through the
crowd, exclaimed: &startq;Mi&s;s Camilla Tyrold! is it
po&s;&s;ible! what can you do here, madam?&endq;</P>
<P>It was Dr. Marchmont, whom the affrighted
Camilla, &s;pringing forward, could only an&s;wer in
catching by the arm.</P>
<P>&startq;Tyrold&endq; repeated the old gentleman; &startq;Is her
name Tyrold?&endq;</P>
<P>Sorry now to have pronounced it in this mixt
company, Dr. Marchmont evaded any an&s;wer;
and, begging her to be compo&s;ed, a&s;ked whither,
or to whom, he might have the honour of con|ducting
her.</P>
<P><PB N="6" REF="7">
&startq;Almo&s;t all my family are here,&endq; cried &s;he,
&startq;but I could not make Dr. Orkborne &s;hew me
the way to them.&endq;</P>
<P>The old gentleman then, repeating &startq;Tyrold!
why if her name is Tyrold, I'll take care of her
my&s;elf;&endq; invited her into his apartment.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont, thanking him, &s;aid: This
young lady has friends, who in all probability are
now unea&s;ily &s;eeking her; we mu&s;t lo&s;e no time in
joining them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, but, well,&endq; cried the old &s;tranger, &startq;let
her come into my room till the coa&s;t is clear, and
then take her away in peace. Come, there's a good
girl, come in, do! you're heartily welcome; for
there's a per&s;on of your name that's the be&s;t friend
I ever had in the world. He's gone from our parts,
now; but he's left nothing &s;o good behind. Pray,
my dear, did you ever hear of a gentleman, an old
York&s;hire Baronet, of your name?</P>
<P>&startq;What! my uncle?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your uncle! why are you niece to Sir Hugh
Tyrold?&endq;</P>
<P>Upon her an&s;wering yes, he clapped his hands
with delight, and &s;aying: &startq;Why then I'll take
care of you my&s;elf, if it's at the ri&s;k of my life!&endq;
carried, rather than drew her into his room, the
Doctor following. Then, loudly &s;hutting his door
in the face of Halder, he called out: &startq;Enter my
ca&s;tle who dare! I &s;hall turn a young man my&s;elf,
at the age of &s;eventy, to drub the fir&s;t varlet that
would attack the niece of my dear old friend!&endq;</P>
<P>They &s;oon heard the pa&s;&s;age clear, and, without
deigning to li&s;ten to the petulant revilings with
which young Halder &s;olaced his fooli&s;h rage,
&startq;Why, my dear,&endq; he continued, why did not you
tell me your name was Tyrold at once? I promi&s;e
you, you need carry nothing el&s;e with you into our
parts, to &s;ee all the doors fly open to you. You
make much of him, I hope where he is? for he left
not a dry eye for twenty miles round when he quit|ted
us. I don't know how many &s;uch men you may
<PB N="7" REF="8">
have in Hamp&s;hire; but York&s;hire's a large county,
yet the be&s;t man in it would find it hard to get a
&s;eat in Parliament, where Sir Hugh Tyrold would
offer him&s;elf to be a candidate. We all &s;ay, in
York&s;hire, he's &s;o &s;tuffed full of goodne&s;s and kind|ne&s;s,
that there's no room left in him for any thing
el&s;e; that's our way of talking of him in York&s;hire;
if you have a better way in Hamp&s;hire, I &s;hall be
glad to learn it; never too late for that; I hate pride.&endq;</P>
<P>No po&s;&s;ible di&s;turbance could make Camilla in|&s;en&s;ible
to plea&s;ure in the prai&s;e of her uncle, or
depre&s;s her &s;pirits from joining in his eulogy; and
her attention, and brightening looks, drew a narra|tive
from the old gentleman of the baronet's good
actions and former kindne&s;&s;es, &s;o plea&s;ant both to
the &s;peaker and the hearer, that the one forgot he
had never &s;een her before, and the other, the fright|ful
adventure which had occa&s;ioned their meeting
now.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont at length, looking at his watch,
inquired what &s;he meant to do? to &s;eek her &s;i&s;ter
and party, &s;he an&s;wered; and, returning her ho&s;t
the warme&s;t acknowledgments for his a&s;&s;i&s;tance
and goodne&s;s, &s;he was going; but, &s;topping her:
&startq;How now? he cried, &startq;don't you want to know
who I am? Now I have told you I am a friend of your
uncle, don't you &s;uppo&s;e he'll a&s;k you my name?</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;miling, a&s;&s;ured him &s;he wi&s;hed much
to be informed, but knew not how to trouble him
with the que&s;tion.</P>
<P>&startq;Why my name, my dear, is We&s;twyn, and
when you &s;ay that to your uncle, he won't give you
a &s;our look for your pains; take my word for that
beforehand. I carried over his nephew and heir,
a cou&s;in, I &s;uppo&s;e, of yours, to Leip&s;ic with me,
about eight years ago, along with a boy of my own,
Hal We&s;twyn; a very good lad, I a&s;&s;ure you, though
I never tell him &s;o to his face for fear of pu&s;&s;ing
him up; I hate a boy puffed up; he commonly
comes to no good; that's the only fault of my ho|noured
friend; he &s;poils all young people&mdash;witne&s;s
<PB N="8" REF="9">
that &s;ame cou&s;in of yours, that I can't &s;ay I much
like; no more does he me; but tell your good uncle
you have met me; and tell him I love and honour
him as I ought to do; I don't know how to do
more, or el&s;e I would; tell him this, my dear.
And I have not forgot what he did for me once,
when I was hard run; and I don't intend it; I'm
no friend to &s;hort memories.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla &s;aid, his name, and her uncle's regard
for him, had long been familiar to her; and told
him Clermont Lynmere was of the party to South|ampton,
though &s;he knew not how to enter abruptly
into an explanation of his mi&s;take concerning the
inheritance. Mr. We&s;twyn an&s;wered he was in no
hurry to &s;ee Clermont, who was not at all to his
ta&s;te; but would not quit Hamp&s;hire without vi&s;iting
Cleves: and when he gathered that two more nieces
of Sir Hugh were in the hou&s;e, he de&s;ired to be
pre&s;ented to them.</P>
<P>Upon re-entering the pa&s;&s;age, to the great amu&s;e|ment
of Dr. Marchmont, and &s;erious provocation
of Camilla, they perceived Dr. Orkborne, &s;tanding
preci&s;ely where he had fir&s;t &s;tationed him&s;elf; attend|ing
no more to the general hubbub than to her parti|cular
entreaty, and as regardle&s;s of the various jolts
he had received during the tumult, as of the ob&s;truc|tion
he cau&s;ed, by his inconvenient po&s;ition, to the
ha&s;te of the pa&s;&s;ers by. Still &s;teadily repo&s;ing again&s;t
the banni&s;ters, he worked hard at refining his para|graph,
per&s;uaded, &s;ince not &s;ummoned by Mi&s;s
Margland, he had be&s;towed upon it but a few
minutes, though he had been fixed to that &s;pot near
an hour.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland received Camilla with a civility
which, &s;ince her po&s;itive and public affiance to
Edgar, &s;he thought nece&s;&s;ary to the mi&s;tre&s;s of
Beech Park; but &s;he looked upon Dr. Marchmont,
whom &s;he concluded to have been her advocate, with
a cold ill-will, which, for Mr. We&s;twyn, &s;he &s;ea&s;oned
&s;till more &s;trongly by a portion of contemptuous
<PB N="9" REF="10">
haughtine&s;s; from a ready di&s;po&s;ition to believe
every &s;tranger, not formally announced, beneath her
notice.</P>
<P>The Doctor &s;oon retired, and found Edgar in his
apartment, ju&s;t returned from a long &s;troll. He re|counted
to him the late tran&s;action, with reiterated
exhortations to circum&s;pection, from added doubts
of the &s;olidity, though with new prai&s;e of the
attractions of Camilla. &startq;She &s;eems a character,&endq;
he &s;aid, &startq;difficult to re&s;i&s;t, and yet more difficult to
attach. Nothing &s;erious appears to impre&s;s her for
two minutes together. Let us &s;ee if the thought|le&s;&s;ne&s;s
and inadvertence thus perpetually fertile of
danger, re&s;ult from youthful inexperience, or have
their &s;ource in innate levity. Time and rea&s;on will
rectify the fir&s;t; but time, and even rea&s;on, will
but harden and embolden the latter. Prudence,
therefore, mu&s;t now interfere; or pa&s;&s;ion may fly,
when the union it has formed mo&s;t requires its con|tinuance.&endq;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. II.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An Author's Time-keeper.</HEAD>
<P>MR. WESTWYN, charmed to meet &s;o many
$ear relations of a long-valued friend, &s;truck
by the extraordinary beauty of Indiana, and by the
&s;en&s;ible an&s;wers of the child, as he called Eugenia;
as well as caught by the united loveline&s;s of per&s;on
and of mind which he ob&s;erved in Camilla, could
not bring him&s;elf to retire till the dinner was upon
the table: pleading, in excu&s;e for his &s;tay, his for|mer
intimacy with Sir Hugh. Mi&s;s Margland,
&s;eeing in him nothing that marked fa&s;hion, &s;trove to
di&s;tance him by a high demeanour: but though not
<PB N="10" REF="11">
wanting in &s;hrewdne&s;s, Mr. We&s;twyn was a perfectly
natural man, and only thinking her manners di&s;agree|able,
without &s;u&s;pecting her intention, took but
little notice of her, from the time he &s;aw &s;he could
give him no plea&s;ure: while with the young party,
he was &s;o much delighted, that he &s;eriou&s;ly regretted
he had only one &s;on to offer among&s;t them.</P>
<P>When the dinner was &s;erved, Eugenia grew unea&s;y
that Dr. Orkborne &s;hould be &s;ummoned, who&s;e non|appearance
&s;he had not ventured to mention, from
the profe&s;&s;ed hatred of his very &s;ight avowed by Mi&s;s
Margland. But Camilla, brought up to exert con|&s;tantly
her courage for the ab&s;ent, told the waiter to
call the gentleman from the head of the &s;tairs.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My ma&s;ter him&s;elf, ma'am,&endq; he an&s;wered &startq;as
well as I, both told the gentleman the company he
came with were &s;erved; but he as good as bid us
both hold our tongues. He &s;eems to have taken a
great liking to that place upon the &s;tairs; though
there's nothing I know of particular in it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But, if you tell him we wait dinner&mdash;&endq; cried
Eugenia; when Mi&s;s Margland, interrupting her
&s;aid, &startq;I'm &s;ure then, you won't tell him true: for
I beg we may all begin. I think it would be rather
more decorous he &s;hould wait for us!&endq;</P>
<P>The waiter, neverthele&s;s, went; but pre&s;ently
returned, &s;omewhat ruffled; &s;aying, &startq;The gentle|man
does not choo&s;e to hear me, ma'am. He &s;ays,
if he mayn't be let alone one &s;ingle minute, it will be
throwing away all his morning. I can't &s;ay I know
what he means; but he &s;peaks rather froppi&s;h. I'd
as lieve not go to him again, if you plea&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland declared, &s;he wi&s;hed him no better
dinner than his pot-hooks; but did not doubt he
would come ju&s;t before they had done, as u&s;ual;
and he was no more mentioned: though &s;he never
in her life eat &s;o fa&s;t; and the table was ordered to

<P><PB N="11" REF="12">
Mi&s;s Margland, when the cloth was removed,
propo&s;ed a &s;ally in &s;earch of lodgings. Camilla and
Eugenia, de&s;irous of a private conference, begged to
remain within; though the latter &s;ought to take
care of her ab&s;ent preceptor, before &s;he could enjoy
the conver&s;ation of her &s;i&s;ter; and when Mi&s;s Marg|land
and Indiana, in &s;ecret exultation at his dinner|le&s;s
&s;tate, had glided, with &s;ilent &s;impering, pa&s;t him,
flew to be&s;eech his con&s;ent to take &s;ome nouri&s;hment.</P>
<P>Such, however, was his pre&s;ent ab&s;orption in
what he was writing, that the voluntary kindne&s;s of
his pupil was as unwelcome as the forced intru&s;ion of
the waiter; and he conjured her to grant him a little
re&s;pite from &s;uch eternal tormenting, with the plain|tive
impatience of deprecating &s;ome injury.</P>
<P>The &s;i&s;ters, now, equally eager to relate and to
li&s;ten to their mutual affairs, &s;hut them&s;elves up in
the apartment of Eugenia; who, with the greate&s;t
&s;implicity, began the di&s;cour&s;e, by &s;aying, &startq;Have
you heard, my dear &s;i&s;ter, that Clermont has refu&s;ed
me?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was &s;everely &s;hocked. Accu&s;tomed her|&s;elf
to the face and form of Eugenia, which, to
her innocent affection, pre&s;ented always the image of
her virtuous mind and cultivated under&s;tanding, &s;he
had not pre&s;aged even the po&s;&s;ibility of &s;uch an
event; and, though &s;he had &s;een with concern the
inequality of their outward appearance, Clermont
had &s;eemed to her, in all el&s;e, &s;o inferior to her
&s;i&s;ter, that &s;he had repined at his unworthine&s;s, but
never doubted the alliance.</P>
<P>She was di&s;tre&s;&s;ed how to offer any con&s;olation;
but &s;oon found none was required. Eugenia was
compo&s;ed and contented, though pen&s;ive, and not
without &s;ome feeling of mortification. Yet anger
and re&s;entment had found no place in the tran&s;action.
Her equity acknowledged that Clermont had every
right of choice: but while her candour induced her
to even applaud his di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s in relinqui&s;hing
the Cleves e&s;tate, her capacity pointed out how ter|rible
<PB N="12" REF="13">
mu&s;t be the per&s;onal defects, that &s;o &s;peedily,
without one word of conver&s;ation, one trial of any
&s;ort how their ta&s;tes, tempers, or characters might
accord, &s;timulated him to &s;o deci&s;ive a rejection.
This view of her unfortunate appearance ca&s;t her, at
fir&s;t, into a train of melancholy ideas, that would
fa&s;t have led her to unhappine&s;s, though wholly un|mixed
with any regret of Clermont, had not the
natural philo&s;ophy of her mind come to her aid; or
had her education been of a more worldly &s;ort.</P>
<P>When Camilla related her own hi&s;tory, her plan
of making Edgar again completely ma&s;ter of his
own proceedings met the entire approbation of Eu|genia,
who, with a &s;erious &s;mile, &s;aid, &startq;Take
warning by me, my dear &s;i&s;ter! and, little as you
have rea&s;on to be brought into any compari&s;on with
&s;uch a one as me, anticipate the di&s;grace of de|fection!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, much touched, embraced her, &s;incerely
wi&s;hing &s;he were half as &s;aultle&s;s as her excellent &s;elf.</P>
<P>The return of Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana obliged
them to quit their retreat: and they now found
Dr. Orkborne in the dining-room Having fini&s;hed
his paragraph, he had &s;ought his party of his own
accord; but, meeting with no one, had taken a
book from his pocket, with which he meant to be|guile
the appetite he felt ri&s;ing, till the hour of
dinner, which he had not the &s;malle&s;t &s;u&s;picion was
over: for of the progre&s;s of time he had no know|ledge
but by its palpable pa&s;&s;age from the &s;un to the
moon; his watch was never wound up, and the
morning and the evening were but announced to him
by a &s;ummons to breakfa&s;t and to &s;upper.</P>
<P>The ladies &s;eated them&s;elves at the window.
Indiana was enchanted by the concour&s;e, of gay
and well dre&s;&s;ed people pa&s;&s;ing by, and far from in|&s;en&s;ible
to the vi&s;ible &s;urpri&s;e and plea&s;ure &s;he excited
in tho&s;e who ca&s;t up their eyes at the hotel.
Eugenia, to whom a great and populous town was
entirely new, found al&s;o, in the diver&s;ity as well as
<PB N="13" REF="14">
novelty of its objects, much matter for remark and
contemplation; Mi&s;s Margland had experienced the
utmo&s;t &s;atisfaction in &s;eeing, at la&s;t, &s;ome faces and
&s;ome things le&s;s ru&s;tic than had been pre&s;ented to her
in York&s;hire or at Cleves; and Camilla had every
hope that this place, in Edgar's own expre&s;&s;ion,
would terminate every perplexity, and give local date
to her life's permanent felicity.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, a youth appeared on the oppo|&s;ite
pa$ement, who&s;e air was new to none of the
party, yet not immediately recollected by any. It
was &s;triking, however, in elegance and in melan|choly.
Eugenia recollected him fir&s;t, and &s;tarting
back, ga&s;ped for breath; Indiana the next moment
called out, &startq;Ah!&mdash;it's Mr Melmond!&endq; and
blu&s;$ing high, her whole face was bright and dim|pled
with unexpected delight.</P>
<P>He walked on, without looking up, and Indiana,
&s;imply piqued as well as chagrined, &s;aid &s;he was glad
he was gone.</P>
<P>But Eugenia looked after him with a gentle &s;igh,
which now fir&s;t &s;he thought blamele&s;s, and a plea&s;ure,
which, though half mournful, &s;he now &s;uffered her|&s;elf
to encourage. Free from all ties that made her
&s;hun this partiality as culpable, &s;he &s;ecretly told her|&s;elf
&s;he might now, without injury to any one, in|dulge
it for an object whom, little as he was known to
her, &s;he internally painted with all the &s;aultle&s;s qua|lities
of ideal excellence.</P>
<P>From the&s;e meditations &s;he was rou&s;ed by Dr.
Orkborne's looking rather wi&s;hfully round him, and
exclaiming, &startq;Pray&mdash;don't we dine rather late?&endq;</P>
<P>The mi&s;take being cleared up, by Mi&s;s Marg|land's
a&s;&s;uring him it was impo&s;&s;ible to keep dinner
waiting all day, for people who cho&s;e to &s;tand whole
hours upon a &s;tairca&s;e, he felt rather di&s;comforted:
but when Eugenia privately ordered him a repa&s;t in
his own chamber, he was amply con&s;oled, by the
uncon&s;trained freedom with which he was empowered
<PB N="14" REF="15">
to have more books upon the table than plates; and
to make more ink &s;pots than he eat mouthfuls.</P>
<P>Camilla had the mortification to find, upon her
returh home, that Edgar had made his promi&s;ed
vi&s;it, not only in her ab&s;ence, but while Mrs. Ber|linton
was &s;till with her aunt.</P>
<P>That lady then communicated to Camilla the &s;e|cret
to which, while yet in ignorance of its exi&s;tence,
&s;he now found &s;he had been &s;acrificed. Mrs. Ecton,
two years ago, had given her hand, in the mo&s;t &s;o|lemn
privacy, to her butler, who now attended her
to Southampton. To avoid di&s;obliging a &s;ick old
relation, from whom &s;he expected a con&s;iderable le|gacy,
&s;he had prevailed with her hu&s;band to con&s;ent
that the marriage &s;hould not be divulged: but cer|tain
that whatever now might be her fortune, &s;he
had no power to bequeath it from her new con|nexion,
the terror of leaving utterly de&s;titute a
beautiful young creature, who believed her&s;elf well
provided for, had induced her to nearly force her
acceptance of an almo&s;t &s;uperannuated old man of
family; who, merely coveting her beauty, inquired
not into her inclination. The &s;ame latent cau&s;e had
made her inexorable to the pleadings of young
Melmond; who, conceiving his fortune dependent
upon the plea&s;ure of his aunt, his certain income
being trifling, thought it his duty to fly the fair
object of his adoration, when he di&s;covered the de|ceit
of Lionel with regard to the inheritance of Sir
Hugh. This &s;ick old relation was now ju&s;t dead,
and had left to her &s;ole di&s;po&s;al a con&s;iderable e&s;tate.
The hu&s;band naturally refu&s;ed to be kept any longer
from his ju&s;t rights; but the &s;hame &s;he felt of mak|ing
the di&s;covery of a marriage contracted clande&s;|tinely,
after &s;he was &s;ixty years of age, with a man
under thirty, threw her into a nervous fever. And,
in this &s;tate, unable to reveal to her nephew an event
which now affected him alone, &s;he prevailed with Mr.
Ul&s;t, who was willing to revi&s;it his original home,
Southampton, to accompany her thither in his u&s;ual
<PB N="15" REF="16">
capacity, till &s;he had &s;ummoned her nephew and
niece, and acquainted them with the affair.</P>
<P>To her&s;elf, Mrs. Berlinton &s;aid, the evil of this
tran&s;action has been over, while yet it was unknown;
&s;he had heard it, therefore, in &s;ilence, and forborne
unavailing reproach. But her brother, to whom
the blow was new, and the con&s;equences were &s;till
impending, was &s;truck with extreme angui&s;h, that
while thus every po&s;&s;ible hope was extingui&s;hed with
regard to his love, he mu&s;t &s;uddenly apply him&s;elf
to &s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s, or be reduced to the mo&s;t ob&s;cure
poverty.</P>
<P>Camilla heard the account with &s;incere concern for
them both, much heightened for young Melmond,
upon finding that, by his expre&s;s de&s;ire, his &s;i&s;ter
now relinqui&s;hed her de&s;ign of cultivating an acquain|tance
with Indiana, whom he had the virtue to de|termine
to avoid, &s;ince his fortune, and even his
hopes, were thus irretrievably ruined.</P>
<P>They conver&s;ed together to a late hour; and Ca|milla,
before they parted, made the mo&s;t earne&s;t apo|logies
for the liberty taken with her hou&s;e by Mrs.
Mittin: but Mrs. Berlinton, with the utmo&s;t &s;weet|ne&s;s,
begged &s;he might &s;tay till all her bu&s;ine&s;s with
her was &s;ettled; &s;milingly adding, bu&s;ine&s;s alone,
&s;he was &s;ure could bring them together.</P>
<P>Much relieved, &s;he then determined to pre&s;s Mrs.
Mittin to collect and pay her accounts immediately;
and to avoid with her, in the meanwhile, any further
tran&s;actions.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. III.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">An agreeable Hearing.</HEAD>
<P>EARLY the next morning, Camilla went to
the hotel, in the carriage of Mrs. Berlinton;
eluding, though not without difficulty, the company
of Mrs. Mittin. She found the party all in good
&s;pirits; Indiana, in particular, was completely
elated; joined to the admiration &s;he believed awaited
her in this large and fa&s;hionable town, &s;he now
knew &s;he might meet there the only per&s;on who had
ever excited in her youthful, and nearly vacant
brea&s;t any appropriate plea&s;ure, &s;uper-added to the
general ze&s;t of being adored. She did not, indeed,
think of marrying any one who could not offer her
a coach and four; but &s;o little was &s;he di&s;turbed by
thinking at all, that the delight of being adulated
by the man &s;he preferred, carried with it no idea of
danger. Eugenia too, &s;oothed with the delu&s;ions
of her romantic but innocent fancy, flattered her|&s;elf
&s;he might now &s;ee continually the object &s;he
conceived formed for meriting her even reverential
regard; and Mi&s;s Margland was importantly occu|pied
upon affairs be&s;t &s;uited to her ta&s;te and ancient
habits, in deliberating how fir&s;t to bring forth her
fair charge with the mo&s;t brilliant effect.</P>
<P>Camilla was much embara&s;&s;ed how to parry an
introduction to Mrs. Berlinton, upon which all the
females bulk as the foundation of their Southampton
pro&s;perity; the young ones, already informed &s;he
was the &s;i&s;ter of Melmond, langui&s;hing to know her
for his &s;ake; and Mi&s;s Margland, formerly acquainted
with the noble family of her hu&s;band, being impa|tient
to re&s;ume her claims in &s;imilar circles; but an
<PB N="17" REF="18">
awkard beginning apology was &s;et a&s;ide by the
entrance of Edgar and Dr. Marchmont.</P>
<P>Indiana now poured forth innumerable que&s;tions
upon what &s;he might look forward to with re&s;pect to
balls and public places; Eugenia a&s;ked nearly as
many concerning the buildings, antiquities, and
pro&s;pects; and Mi&s;s Margland more than either,
relative to the company, their genealogies and con|nexions.
The two Doctors &s;oon &s;at aloof, con|ferring
upon le&s;s familiar matters; but Edgar only
&s;poke in reply, and Camilla uttered not a word.</P>
<P>Soon after, a voice on the &s;tairs called out,
&startq;O never mind &s;hewing me the way; if I come to
a wrong room, I'll go on till I come to a right;&endq;
and the next minute young Lynmere &s;allied into the
apartment.</P>
<P>&startq;I could not get to you la&s;t night,&endq; &startq;cried he;&endq;
&startq;and I can only &s;tay a moment now. I have a
pretty &s;erious bu&s;ine&s;s upon my hands; &s;o if you
can give me any breakfa&s;t, don't lo&s;e time.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, willing to plea&s;e the brother of
Indiana, readily ordered for him whatever the inn
could afford, of which he failed not heartily to par|take,
&s;aying, &startq;I have met with a good comic &s;ort
of adventure here already Gue&s;s what it is?</P>
<P>Indiana complied; but his own wi&s;h to communi|cate
was &s;o much &s;tronger than that of any one to
hear, that, before &s;he could pronounce three words,
he cried: Well, if you're &s;o exce&s;&s;ive curious, I'll
tell it you. I'm engaged in a duel.</P>
<P>Indiana &s;creamed; Mi&s;s Margland echoed her
cry; Eugenia, who had looked down from his en|trance,
rai&s;ed her eyes with an air of intere&s;t; Ca|milla
was &s;urpri&s;ed out of her own concerns; and
Edgar &s;urveyed him with an a&s;toni&s;hment not wholly
unmixt with contempt; but the two Doctors went
on with their own di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, nay, Dye, don't be frightened; 'tis not
a duel in which I am to fight my&s;elf; I am only to
be &s;econd. But &s;uppo&s;e I were fir&s;t? what &s;ignifies?
<PB N="18" REF="19">
the&s;e are things we have in hand &s;o often, we
don't think of them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;La! brother! you don't &s;ay &s;o?&endq; cried Indi|ana:
&startq;La! how droll!&endq; He then pretended that
he would tell nothing more.</P>
<P>Camilla inquired if he had &s;een Mr. We&s;twyn,
whom &s;he had met with the preceding day.</P>
<P>&startq;Not I, faith! but that's a-propos enough;
for it's his &s;on that has a&s;ked me to be his &s;econd.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, poor good old Mr. We&s;twyn!&endq; cried Ca|milla,
now much intere&s;ted in this hi&s;tory; &startq;and
can you not &s;ave him &s;uch a &s;hock? can you not
be mediator in&s;tead of &s;econd? he &s;eems &s;o fond of
his &s;on&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, as to him, it's no matter; he's &s;uch a har&s;h
old huncks, I &s;hall be glad to have him worked a
little; I've often wanted to pull him by the no&s;e,
my&s;elf, he takes &s;uch liberties with me. But did
you ever hear of &s;uch a fool as his &s;on? he de&s;erves
to be badgered as bad as his father; he's going to
fight with as fine an hone&s;t fellow as ever I met
with, for nothing at all! ab&s;olutely nothing!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear! how droll!&endq; &s;aid Indiana.</P>
<P>&startq;But why can you not interfere?&endq; cried Ca|milla:
&startq;poor Mr. We&s;twyn will be made &s;o un|happy
if any evil befals his &s;on!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, faith, as to him, he may take it as he will;
I &s;han't trouble my head about him; he has made
free enough with me, I can a&s;&s;ure you; it's only to
have him out of the way, that the bu&s;ine&s;s is put
off till noon; it was to have been in the morning,
but the old tyrant took it into his pate to make
poor Henry, who is one of your good ones, and
does nothing to vex him on purpo&s;e, ride out with
him; he has promi&s;ed, however, to get off by
twelve o'clock, when four of us are to be at a cer|tain
&s;pot that I &s;han't name.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla again began to plead the merits of the
father; but Indiana more urgently demanded the
rea&s;on of the combat. &startq;I dare &s;ay, brother, they
<PB N="19" REF="20">
fight about being in love with &s;omebody? don't
they, brother? now do tell me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Not a whit! it's for a girl he don't care a
&s;traw for, and never &s;aw but once in his life, and
don't care a farthing if he never &s;ees again.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear, how droll, brother! I thought people
always fought about being in love with &s;omebody
they wanted to marry; and never but when &s;he
was exce&s;&s;ive pretty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, faith, marriage &s;eldom de&s;erves a fighting
match; but as to being pretty, that's all Harry has
in his excu&s;e, &s;o he pretends &s;he's as divine as an
angel.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear! well, and don't you know any thing
more than that about it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, nor he either; he only &s;aw her at a bath|ing
hou&s;e, where a fine jolly young buck was pay|ing
her a few compliments, that &s;he affected not to
like; and pre&s;ently, in a &s;illy di&s;pute whether &s;he
was a girl of character, they had a violent quar|rel,
and Harry was &s;uch a fool as to end it with a
challenge.&endq;</P>
<P>At the words <HI>a bathing hou&s;e,</HI> the blood for&s;ook
the cheeks of Camilla with &s;udden per&s;onal alarm;
but it mounted high into them again, upon hear|ing
the nature of the di&s;pute; though yet again it
&s;unk, and le&s;t them wholly pallid, at the brief and
final conviction &s;he was the &s;ole cau&s;e of this duel,
and upon &s;o di&s;graceful a di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The emotions of Edgar, though le&s;s fearful,
were not le&s;s violent nor painful. That Camilla
&s;hould be the &s;ubject of any challenge was &s;hock|ing,
but of &s;uch a one he thought a di&s;honour;
yet to prevent, and with the lea&s;t publicity, its
effect, was the immediate occupation of his mind.</P>
<P>A &s;hort pau&s;e en&s;ued, broken pre&s;ently by Cler|mont,
who, looking at his watch, &s;uddenly jumped
up, and calling out, &startq;Faith, I &s;hall be too late!&endq;
was capering out of the room; but the &s;hame of
Camilla in the di&s;grace, was overpowered by her
terror of its con&s;equences, and &s;tarting up, and
<PB N="20" REF="21">
cla&s;ping her hands, &startq;O cou&s;in! O Clermont!&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;for Heaven's &s;ake &s;top this affair!&endq;</P>
<P>Clermont, &s;atisfied that a &s;ufficient alarm was
rai&s;ed to impede the tran&s;action, without any con|ce&s;&s;ion
on his part, declared him&s;elf bound in ho|nour
to attend the appointment, and, in extreme
&s;eeming ha&s;te and earne&s;tne&s;s, walked off: &s;top|ping,
however, when he came to the door, not to
li&s;ten to the &s;upplications of his cou&s;in, but to to&s;s
off a fre&s;h cup of chocolate, which a waiter was
ju&s;t carrying to the next room.</P>
<P>Camilla now, her face varying in colour twenty
times in a minute, and her whole frame &s;haking,
while her eyes were ca&s;t, con&s;cious and timid, on
the floor, approached Edgar, and &s;aying, &startq;This
young man's father is my dear uncle's friend!&mdash;&endq;
bur&s;t into tears.</P>
<P>Edgar, wholly di&s;&s;olved, took her hand, pre&s;&s;ed
it to his lips, be&s;ought her, in a low voice, to di&s;|mi&s;s
her apprehen&s;ions, in the confidence of his
mo&s;t ardent exertions, and again ki&s;&s;ing her hand,
with the words, &startq;Too&mdash;O, far too dear Camilla!&endq;
ha&s;tened after Lynmere.</P>
<P>Affected in a thou&s;and ways, &s;he dropt, weep|ing,
upon a chair. Should the duel take place, and
any fatal con&s;equences follow, &s;he felt &s;he &s;hould
never be happy again; and even, &s;hould it be pre|vented,
its very &s;ugge&s;tion, from &s;o horrible a
doubt of her character, &s;eemed a &s;tain from which
it could never recover. The incon&s;iderate facility
with which &s;he had wandered about with a per&s;on
&s;o little known to her, &s;o underbred, and &s;o for|ward,
appeared now to her&s;elf inexcu&s;able; and
&s;he determined, if but &s;pared this dreadful puni&s;h|ment,
to pa&s;s the whole of her future life in un|remitting
caution.</P>
<P>Eugenia, with the kinde&s;t &s;ympathy, and Indi|ana
and Mi&s;s Margland, with extreme curio&s;ity,
&s;ought to di&s;cover the rea&s;on of her emotion; but
while begging them to di&s;pen&s;e with an explana|tion,
<PB N="21" REF="22">
old Mr. We&s;twyn was announced and ap|peared.</P>
<P>The horrors of a culprit, the mo&s;t cruel as well
as criminal, &s;eemed in&s;tantly the portion of the
&s;elf-condemned Camilla; and, as he advanced with
chearful kindne&s;s, to inquire after her health, his
ignorance that all his happine&s;s, through her
means, was that moment at &s;take, pierced her with
a &s;uffering &s;o exqui&s;ite, that &s;he uttered a deep
groan, and &s;unk back upon her chair.</P>
<P>An in&s;tant's recollection brought her more of
fortitude, though not of comfort; and &s;pringing
up and addre&s;&s;ing, though not looking at Mr.
We&s;twyn, who was &s;taring at her with a&s;toni&s;h|ment
and concern: &startq;Where, &s;ir,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;is

<P>&startq;My &s;on!&endq; repeated the good old gentleman,
wanting no other word to participate in any alarm;
&startq;what, Hal We&s;twyn?&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Follow him&mdash;&s;eek&mdash;him&mdash;&s;end for him&mdash;and
do not, a &s;ingle in&s;tant, lo&s;e &s;ight of him all
day!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My dear young lady, what do you mean? I'll
&s;end for him, to be &s;ure, if you de&s;ire it; but what
makes you &s;o good as to think about my &s;on? did
you ever &s;ee my &s;on? do you know my &s;on? do
you know Hal We&s;twyn?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Don't a&s;k now, dear &s;ir! &s;ecure him fir&s;t, and
make what inquiries you plea&s;e afterwards.&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;twyn, in evident con&s;ternation, walked
out, Camilla her&s;elf opening the door; but turn|ing
back in the pa&s;&s;age, &s;trongly &s;aid: &startq;If the boy
has been guilty of any mi&s;behaviour, I won't &s;up|port
him; I don't like mi&s;behaviour; it's a bad
thing; I can't take to it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O no! no! quite the contrary!&endq; exclaimed the
agitated Camilla, he is good, kind, generous! I
owe him the greate&s;t obligation! and I de&s;ire
<PB N="22" REF="23">
nothing upon earth &s;o much, at this moment, as to
&s;ee him, and to thank him!&endq;</P>
<P>The old gentleman's eyes now filled with tears,
and coming back, and mo&s;t affectionately &s;haking
hands with her, &startq;I was afraid he had mi&s;behaved,&endq;
he cried; &startq;but he was always a good lad; and if
he has done any thing for the niece of my dear
Sir Hugh Tyrold, I &s;hall hug him to my heart!&endq;
and then, in great, but plea&s;ed perturbation, he
hurried away, &s;aying to him&s;elf, as he went: &startq;I'll
take him to her, to be &s;ure; I de&s;ire nothing
better! God ble&s;s her! If &s;he can &s;peak &s;o well of
my poor Hal, &s;he mu&s;t be the be&s;t girl living! and
&s;he &s;hall have him&mdash;yes, &s;he &s;hall have him, if &s;he's
a mind to him; and I don't care if &s;he i'n't worth
a groat; &s;he's niece to my old friend; that's
better.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla &s;peeding, but not hearing him, returned
to her &s;eat; yet could not an&s;wer one que&s;tion,
from the horrors of her fears, and her &s;hame of the
detail of the bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>When the breakfa&s;t was over, Mi&s;s Margland
de&s;ired every one would get ready to go the lodg|ings;
and, with Indiana, repaired her&s;elf to vi&s;it
them, and give general orders. Dr. Marchmont
had glided out of the room, in anxiety for Edgar;
to the great di&s;&s;atisfaction, and almo&s;t contempt of
Dr. Orkborne, with whom he was ju&s;t di&s;cu&s;&s;ing
&s;ome controverted points upon the &s;hield of Achil|les;
which, that he could quit for the light concerns
of a young man, added again to his &s;urmi&s;es that,
though he had run creditably the u&s;ual &s;chola&s;tic
race, his reputation was more the effect of general
ability and addre&s;s, than of &s;uch &s;ound and con&s;um|mate
learning as he him&s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed. Ruminating
upon the ignorant inju&s;tice of mankind, in &s;uffer|ing
&s;uch quacks in literature and philology to
carry the palm of fame, he went to his chamber, to
collect, from his bol&s;ter and bed&s;ide, the hoard of
books and papers, from which, the preceding
night, he had di&s;encumbered his coat, wai&s;tcoat,
<PB N="23" REF="24">
and great coat pockets, in&s;ide and out, to review
before he could &s;leep; and which now were again
to encircle him, to facilitate their change of
abode.</P>
<P>But Eugenia would not quit her afflicted &s;i&s;ter,
who &s;oon, in her gentle brea&s;t, depo&s;ited the whole
of her grief, her apprehen&s;ions, and her plans;
charging her in&s;tantly to retire, if Edgar &s;hould
return, that whatever might be the event he &s;hould
unfold, &s;he might relea&s;e him immediately from an
engagement that his la&s;t words &s;eemed to avow
did not make him happy, and that probably he
now repented. The de&s;ign was &s;o con&s;onant to
the native heroi&s;m of Eugenia, that &s;he con&s;ented,
with applau&s;e, to aid its execution.</P>
<P>About half an hour, which &s;eemed to be pro|longed
to twenty times the duration of the whole
day, pa&s;&s;ed in terrible expectation; Edgar then ap|peared,
and Eugenia, &s;u&s;pending her earne&s;t cu|rio&s;ity,
to comply with the acute feelings of her
&s;i&s;ter, retreated.</P>
<P>Camilla could &s;carce breathe; &s;he &s;tood up, her
eyes and mouth open, her face pale, her hands up|lifted,
waiting, but not daring to demand intelli|gence.</P>
<P>Edgar, entering into her di&s;tre&s;s with a tender|ne&s;s
that drove from him his own, eagerly &s;atis|fied
her: &startq;All,&endq; he cried, &startq;is &s;afe; the affair has
been compromi&s;ed: no duel has taken place; and
the parties have mutually pledged them&s;elves to
forget the di&s;pute.&endq;</P>
<P>Tears again, but no longer bitter, flowed copi|ou&s;ly
down her cheeks, while her rai&s;ed eyes and
cla&s;ped hands expre&s;&s;ed the fervency of her thank|fulne&s;s.</P>
<P>Edgar, extremely touched, took her hand; he
wi&s;hed to &s;eize a moment &s;o nearly awful, to en|force
upon her mind every &s;erious &s;ubject with
which he mo&s;t de&s;ired it to be impre&s;&s;ed; but &s;or|row
was ever &s;acred to him: and de&s;iring only, at
this period, to con&s;ole her: &startq;This adventure,&endq; he
<PB N="24" REF="25">
cried, &startq;has now terminated &s;o well, you mu&s;t not
&s;uffer it to wound you. Di&s;mi&s;s it, &s;weet Camilla,
from your memory!&mdash;at lea&s;t till you are more
compo&s;ed.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, &s;ir!&endq; cried Camilla, to whom his &s;oftne&s;s,
by re&s;toring her hope of an ultimately happy con|clu&s;ion,
re&s;tored &s;trength; &startq;it ought never to be
di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from my memory; and what I am now
going to &s;ay will fix it there indelibly.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar was &s;urpri&s;ed, but plea&s;ed; his mo&s;t anxi|ous
wi&s;hes &s;eemed on the point of being fulfilled;
he expected a voluntary explanation of every per|plexity,
a clearance of all my&s;tery.</P>
<P>&startq;I am &s;en&s;ible that I have appeared to you,&endq;
&s;he re&s;umed, &startq;in many points reprehen&s;ible; in
&s;ome, perhaps, inexcu&s;able&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Inexcu&s;able? O no! never! never!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The letters of Sir Sedley Clarendel I know
you think I ought not to have received&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, biting his nails, looked down.</P>
<P>&startq;And, indeed, I acknowledge my&s;elf, in that
affair, a mo&s;t egregious dupe!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>She blu&s;hed; but her blu&s;h was colourle&s;s to
that of Edgar. Re&s;entment again&s;t Sir Sedley beat
high in every vein; while di&s;appointment to his
delicacy, in the idea of Camilla duped by any man,
&s;eemed, in one blow, to detach him from her per|&s;on,
by a &s;udden di&s;&s;olution of all charm to his
mind in the connection.</P>
<P>Camilla &s;aw, too late, &s;he had been too ha&s;ty in
a confe&s;&s;ion which &s;ome apologi&s;ing account &s;hould
have preceded; but what her courage had begun,
pride now aided her to &s;upport, and &s;he continued.</P>
<P>&startq;For what belongs to that corre&s;pondence, and
even for its being unknown to my friends, I may
offer, perhaps, hereafter, &s;omething in exculpa|tion;&mdash;hereafter,
I &s;ay, building upon your long
family regard; for though we part&mdash;it will be, I
tru&s;t, in amity.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Part!&endq; repeated Edgar recovering from his
di&s;plea&s;ure by amazement.</P>
<P><PB N="25" REF="26">
&startq;Yes, part,&endq; &s;aid &s;he, with a&s;&s;umed firmne&s;s;
&startq;it would be vain to palliate what I cannot di&s;|gui&s;e
from my&s;elf&mdash;I am le&s;&s;ened in your e&s;teem.&endq;
She could not go on; imperious &s;hame took po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion
of her voice, crim&s;oned her very forehead,
blu&s;hed even in her eyes, demoli&s;hed her &s;trained
energy, and enfeebled her genuine &s;pirit.</P>
<P>But the con&s;cious taciturnity of Edgar recalled
her exertions; &s;truck and afflicted by the truth &s;he
had pronounced, he could not controvert it; he
was mute; but his look &s;poke keen di&s;turbance and
bitter regret.</P>
<P>&startq;Not &s;o low, however, am I yet, I tru&s;t, fallen
in your opinion, that you can wonder at the &s;tep I
now take. I am aware of many errours; I know,
too, that appearances have often cruelly mi&s;repre|&s;ented
me; my errours you might have the can|dour
to forget, and fal&s;e appearances I could ea&s;ily
clear in my own favour&mdash;but where, and what is
the tali&s;man which can era&s;e from my own re|membrance
that you have thought me unworthy?&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar &s;tarted; but &s;he would not give him time
to &s;peak; what &s;he had la&s;t uttered was too pain|ful
to her to dwell upon, or hear an&s;wered, and
rapidly, and in an elevated manner, &s;he went on.</P>
<P>&startq;I here, therefore, &s;olemnly relea&s;e you from
all tie, all engagement whatever with Camilla
Tyrold! I &s;hall immediately acquaint my friends
that henceforth&mdash;we Both are Free!</P>
<P>She was then retiring. Edgar, confounded by a
&s;troke &s;o utterly and every way unexpected, neither
an&s;wering nor interpo&s;ing, till he &s;aw her hand
upon the lock of the door. In a voice then, that
&s;poke him cut to the &s;oul, though without at|tempting
to &s;top her, &startq;This then,&endq; he cried,
&startq;Camilla is your final adieu.&endq;</P>
<P>She turned round, and with a face glowing, and
eyes gli&s;tening, held out to him her hand: &startq;I
knew not if you would accept,&endq; &s;he &s;aid &startq;a
kinder word, or I &s;hould have a&s;&s;ured you of my
unaltered regard&mdash;and have claimed the continu|ance
<PB N="26" REF="27">
of your friend&s;hip, and even&mdash;if your pati|ence
is not utterly exhau&s;ted, of your watchful
coun&s;el&mdash;Farewell! remember me without &s;eve|rity!
my own e&s;teem mu&s;t be permanent as my ex|i&s;tence!&endq;</P>
<P>The door, here, was opened by Mi&s;s Margland
and Indiana, and Camilla ha&s;tily &s;natched away the
hand which Edgar, gra&s;ping with the fondne&s;s of
renovated pa&s;&s;ion, &s;ecretly meant to part with no
more, till a final reconciliation once again made it
his own; but compelled to yield to circum&s;tance,
he &s;uffered it to be withdrawn; and while &s;he
darted into the chamber of Eugenia, to hide her
deep emotions from Indiana, who was tittering,
and Mi&s;s Margland, who was &s;neering, at the &s;itu|ation
in which &s;he was &s;upri&s;ed, he abruptly took
leave him&s;elf, too much impre&s;&s;ed by this critical
&s;cene, to labour for unintere&s;ting di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="4" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. IV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Ideas upon Marriage.</HEAD>
<P>WHILE, in the bo&s;om of her faithful &s;i&s;ter,
Camilla repo&s;ed her feelings and her fears, al|ternately
rejoicing and trembling at the temerity
of the re&s;olution &s;he had exerted; Edgar &s;ought
his not le&s;s faithful and honourable, but far more
worldly friend, Dr. Marchmont.</P>
<P>He narrated, with extreme emotion, the &s;cene he
had ju&s;t had with Camilla; a&s;&s;erting her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of every &s;pecies of excellence from the noblene&s;s
of her rejection, and abhorring him&s;elf for having
given her a moment's doubt of his fulle&s;t e&s;teem.
Not a &s;olicitude, he declared, now remained with
<PB N="27" REF="28">
him, but how to appea&s;e her di&s;plea&s;ure, &s;atisfy
her dignity, and recover her favour.</P>
<P>&startq;Softly, &s;oftly!&endq; &s;aid the Doctor; &startq;mea&s;ure
your &s;teps more temperately, ere you run with
&s;uch velocity. If this refu&s;al is the re&s;ult of an
offended &s;en&s;ibility, you cannot exert your&s;elf too
warmly in its con&s;olation; even if it is from pride,
it has a ju&s;t claim to your conce&s;&s;ions, &s;ince &s;he
thinks you have injured it; yet pau&s;e before you
act, may it not be merely from a confidence of
power that loves to tyrannize over its &s;laves, by
playing with their chains? or a lurking &s;pirit of
coquetry, that de&s;ires to regain the liberty of trifl|ing
with &s;ome new Sir Sedley Clarendel or, per|haps,
with Sir Sedley him&s;elf?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dr. Marchmont! how wretchedly ill you
think of women!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I think of them as they are! I think of them
as I have found them. They are artful, though
feeble; they are &s;hallow, yet &s;ubtle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You have been unfortunate in your con|nexions?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yet who had better pro&s;pects? with energies
as warm, with hopes as lively as your own, twice
have I conducted to the altar two beings I thought
framed for my peculiar felicity; but my peace,
my happine&s;s, and my honour, have been torn up
by the root, exactly where I thought I had planted
them for my whole temporal exi&s;tence. This
heart, which to you appears hard and &s;u&s;picious,
has been the dupe of its &s;u&s;ceptibilities; fir&s;t,
in a creature of its own choice, next, where it be|lieved
it&s;elf cho&s;en. That fir&s;t, Mandlebert, had
you &s;een her, you would have thought, as I thought
her my&s;elf&mdash;an angel! She was another Camilla.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Another Camilla!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Grace, &s;weetne&s;s, and beauty vied in her for
pre-eminence. Yes, another Camilla! though I
&s;ee your incredulity; I &s;ee you think my compa|ri&s;on
almo&s;t pro&s;ane; and that grace, &s;weetne&s;s,
and beauty, awaited the birth of Camilla to be made
<PB N="28" REF="29">
known to the world. Such, however, &s;he was, and
I &s;aw and loved at once. I knew her character
fair, I precipitately made my addre&s;&s;es, and con|cluded
my&s;elf beloved in return&mdash;becau&s;e I was
accepted!&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar &s;hrunk back, and ca&s;t down his eyes.</P>
<P>&startq;Nor was it till the moment&mdash;heart-breaking
yet to my recollection!&mdash;of her &s;udden death, that
I knew the lifele&s;s, &s;oulle&s;s, inanimate frame was
all &s;he had be&s;towed upon me. In the private
drawer of her bureau, I then found a pocket-book.
In the fir&s;t leaf, I &s;aw a gentleman's name;&mdash;I
turned over, and &s;aw it again; I looked further,
and &s;till it met my view; I opened by chance,&mdash;
but nothing el&s;e appeared:&mdash;there it was &s;till,
traced in every hand, charactered in every form,
&s;hape, and manner, the wayward, wi&s;tful eye could
delight to fa&s;hion, for varying, yet beholding it
without end: while, over the intermediate &s;paces,
ver&s;es, quotations, &s;hort but affecting &s;entences,
were every where &s;cattered, bewailing the mi&s;ery
of di&s;appointed hope, and unrequited love; of a
heartle&s;s hand devoted at the altar; of vows en|chaining
liberty, not &s;atisfying affection! I then
&mdash;alas, too late! dived deeper, with, then, u&s;ele&s;s
inve&s;tigation,&mdash;and di&s;covered an early pa&s;&s;ion,
never era&s;ed from her mind;&mdash;di&s;covered&mdash;that I
had never made her happy! that &s;he was merely
enduring, &s;uffering me&mdash;while my whole confid|ing
&s;oul was undividedly hers!&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Edgar &s;huddered at this picture; &startq;But why,
then,&endq; he cried, &startq;&s;ince &s;he &s;eemed amiable as well
as fair, why did &s;he accept you?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A&s;k half the married women in the nation
how they became wives: they will tell you their
friends urged them;&mdash;that they had no other e&s;ta|bli&s;hment
in view;&mdash;that nothing is &s;o uncertain
as the repetition of matrimonial powers in women;
&mdash;and that tho&s;e who cannot &s;olicit what they
wi&s;h, mu&s;t accommodate them&s;elves to what of|fers.
This fir&s;t adventure, however, is now no
<PB N="29" REF="30">
longer u&s;eful to you, though upon its hard re|membrance
was founded my former caution: but
I am even my&s;elf &s;atisfied, at pre&s;ent, that the ear|lie&s;t
partiality of Camilla has been yours; what
now you have to weigh is, the &s;trength or inadequacy
of her character, for guiding that partiality to
your mutual happine&s;s. My &s;econd melancholy
hi&s;tory will be&s;t illu&s;trate this difficulty. You
may ea&s;ily believe, the la&s;t of my intentions was
any further e&s;&s;ay in a lottery I had found &s;o in|au&s;picious;
but, while cold even to apathy, it was
my inevitable chance to fall in the way of a plea&s;|ing
and innocent young creature, who gave me,
un&s;ought and unwi&s;hed for, her heart. The
boon, neverthele&s;s, &s;oon caught my own: for
what is &s;o alluring as the voluntary affection of a
virtuous woman?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; cried Edgar, &startq;and what now could
di&s;turb your tranquillity?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The in&s;ufficiency of that heart to its own de|ci&s;ion.
I &s;oon found that her apparent predilec|tion
was &s;imply the re&s;ult of the ca&s;ualty which
brought me almo&s;t exclu&s;ively into her &s;ociety,
but unmarked by any con&s;onance of ta&s;te, feeling,
or under&s;tanding. Her inexperience had made her
believe, &s;ince &s;he preferred me to the few who &s;ur|rounded
her, I was the man of her choice: with
equal facility I concurred in the &s;ame mi&s;take;&mdash;
for what is &s;o credulous as &s;elf-love? But &s;uch a
regard, the child of accident, not &s;election, was
unequal, upon the di&s;covery of the di&s;&s;imilarity of
our di&s;po&s;itions, to the &s;malle&s;t &s;acrifice. My
melancholy returned with the view of our mutual
delu&s;ion; la&s;&s;itude of plea&s;ing was the precur&s;or of
di&s;content. Di&s;&s;ipation then, in the form of amu&s;e|ment,
pre&s;ented it&s;elf to her aid: retirement and
books to came mine. My re&s;ource was &s;afe, though
&s;olitary; her's was gay, but perilous. Di&s;&s;ipation,
with its u&s;ual Proteus powers, from amu&s;ement
changed its form to temptation, allured her into
dangers, impeached her honour, and blighted her
<PB N="30" REF="31">
with di&s;grace. I ju&s;t di&s;cerned the precipice
whence &s;he was falling, in time to avert the dreadful
nece&s;&s;ity of ca&s;ting her off for ever:&mdash;but what was
our life thence forward? Cares unparticipated,
griefs uncommunicated, &s;tifled re&s;entments, and
unremitting wearine&s;s! She is now no more; and
I am a lonely individual for the re&s;t of my pilgri|mage.</P>
<P>&startq;Take warning, my dear young friend, by my
experience. The entire po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the heart of
the woman you marry is not more e&s;&s;ential to your
fir&s;t happine&s;s, than the complete knowledge of her
di&s;po&s;ition is to your ultimate peace.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar thanked him, in deep concern to have
awakened emotions which the ab&s;orption of &s;tudy,
and influence of literature, held generally dor|mant.
The le&s;&s;on, however, which they incul|cated,
he engaged to keep always pre&s;ent to his
con&s;ideration; though, but for the &s;trange affair
of Sir Sedley Clarendel, he &s;hould feel confident
that, in Camilla, there was not more of exterior
attraction, than of &s;olid excellence: and, with re|gard
to their concordance of ta&s;te and humour, he
had never &s;een her &s;o gay, nor &s;o lovely, as in
&s;cenes of active benevolence, or dome&s;tic life. She
had promi&s;ed to clear, hereafter, the tran&s;action
with Sir Sedley; but he could not hold back for
that explanation: hurt, already, by his apparent
&s;cruples, &s;he had openly named them as the motives
of her rejection: could he, then, &s;hew her he yet
demurred, without forfeiting all hope of a future
accommodation?</P>
<P>&startq;Delicacy,&endq; &s;aid Dr. Marchmont, &startq;though the
quality the mo&s;t amiable we can practi&s;e in the &s;er|vice
of others, mu&s;t not take place of common
&s;en&s;e, and &s;ound judgment, for our&s;elves. Her
di&s;mi&s;&s;ion does not di&s;card you from her &s;ociety;
on the contrary, it invites your friend&s;hip&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Doctor! what innocence, what &s;weetne&s;s
does that very circum&s;tance di&s;play!&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="31" REF="32">
&startq;Learn, however, their concomitants, ere you
yield to their charms: learn if their &s;ource is
from a pre&s;ent, yet accidental preference, or from
the nobler &s;pring of elevated &s;entiment. The
meeting you &s;urpri&s;ed with Sir Sedley, the pre|&s;umption
you acknowledge of his letters, and the
confe&s;&s;ion made by her&s;elf that &s;he had &s;ubmitted
to be duped by him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, Dr. Marchmont! what harrowing draw|backs
to felicity! And how much mu&s;t we rather pity
than wonder at the errors of common young wo|men,
when a creature &s;uch as this is &s;o ea&s;y to be
mi&s;led!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You mu&s;t not imagine I mean a cen&s;ure upon
the excellent Mr. Tyrold, when I &s;ay &s;he is left
too much to her&s;elf: the purity of his principles, and
the virtue of his character, mu&s;t exempt him from
blame; but his life has been both too private and
too tranquil to be aware of the dangers run by
Female Youth, when &s;traying from the mother's
careful wing. All that belongs to religion, and to
principle, he feels, and he has taught; but the impe|diments
they have to encounter in a commerce
with mankind, he could not point out, for he does
not know. Yet there is nothing more certain,
than that &s;eventeen weeks is not le&s;s able to go
alone in a nur&s;ery, than &s;eventeen years in the
world.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;ugge&s;tion but added to the bias of Edgar
to take her, if po&s;&s;ible, under his own immediate
guidance.</P>
<P>&startq;Know, fir&s;t,&endq; cried the Doctor, &startq;if to your
guidance &s;he will give way; know if the affair with
Sir Sedley has exculpations which render it &s;ingle
and adventitious, or if there hang upon it a light|ne&s;s
of character that may inve&s;t caprice, chance,
or ficklene&s;s, with powers of involving &s;uch an|other
entanglement.&endq;</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">How to treat a Defamer.</HEAD>
<P>AS the lodgings taken by Mi&s;s Margland could
not be ready till the afternoon, Camilla re|mained
with her &s;i&s;ter; a &s;ojourn which, while it
con&s;oled her with the &s;ociety, and gratified her by
the approbation of Eugenia, had yet another al|lurement;
it detained her under the &s;ame roof with
Edgar; and his manner of li&s;tening to her rejection,
and his undi&s;gui&s;ed &s;uffering before they were
parted, led her to expect he might yet demand a
conference before &s;he quitted the hotel.</P>
<P>In about an hour, as unplea&s;antly as unceremo|niou&s;ly,
they were broken in upon by Mrs. Mitten.
&startq;How mon&s;tro$s lucky, my dear,&endq; cried &s;he to
Camilla, &startq;that I &s;hould find you, and your little
&s;i&s;ter, for I &s;uppo&s;e this is &s;he, together! I went
into your dining room to a&s;k for you, and there I
met tho&s;e other two ladies; and I've made ac|quaintance
with 'em, I a&s;&s;ure you, already; for I
told them I was on a vi&s;it at the Honourable Mrs.
Berlinton's. So I've had the opportunity to re|commend
&s;ome &s;hops to 'em, and I've been to tell
&s;ome of the good folks to &s;end them &s;ome of their
nice&s;t goods for'em to look at; for, really, &s;ince I've
been bu&s;tling a little about here, I've found &s;ome
of the good people &s;o va&s;tly obliging, I can't but
take a plea&s;ure in &s;erving 'em, and getting 'em a
few cu&s;tomers, e&s;pecially as I know a little civility
of that &s;ort makes one friends &s;upri&s;ingly. Often
and often have I got things under prime co&s;t my|&s;elf,
only by helping a per&s;on on in his trade. So
one can't &s;ay good nature's always thrown away.
However, I come now on purpo&s;e to put a note
into your own hands, from Mrs. Berlinton; for
<PB N="33" REF="34">
all the &s;ervants were out of the way, except one, and
he wanted to be about &s;omething el&s;e, &s;o I offered to
bring it, and &s;he was very much plea&s;ed; &s;o I fancy
its about &s;ome &s;ecret, for &s;he never offered to &s;hew it
me; but as to the poor man I &s;aved from the walk,
I've won his heart downright; I dare &s;ay he'll go of
any odd errand for me, now, without vails. That's
the be&s;t of good nature, it always comes home to
one.&endq;</P>
<P>The note from Mrs. Berlinton contained a tender
&s;upplication for the return of Camilla, and a pre&s;&s;ing
and flattering invitation that her &s;i&s;ter &s;hould join their
little party, as the motives of honour and di&s;cretion
which made her, at the reque&s;t and for the &s;ake of her
brother, &s;acrifice her eagerne&s;s to be pre&s;ented to Mi&s;s
Lynmere, operated not to impede her acquaintance
with Mi&s;s Eugenia.</P>
<P>This propo&s;ition had exqui&s;ite charms for Eugenia.
To become acquainted with the &s;i&s;ter of him to whom,
henceforward, &s;he meant to devote her &s;ecret thoughts,
enchanted her imagination. Camilla, therefore, ne|gotiated
the vi&s;it with Mi&s;s Margland, who, though
little plea&s;ed by this &s;eparate invitation, knew not
how to refu&s;e her concurrence; but Indiana, $word$ dig|nant
that the &s;i&s;ter of Melmond &s;hould not, fir&s;t, have
waited upon her, and &s;olicited her friend&s;hip, pri|vately
re&s;olved, in pique of this di&s;re&s;pect, to puni&s;h
the brother with every rigour &s;he could invent.</P>
<P>Camilla, upon her return, found Mrs. Mitten al|ready
deeply engaged in propo&s;ing an alteration in the
dre&s;s of Eugenia, which &s;he was aiding Molly Mill to
accompli&s;h; and &s;o much &s;he found to &s;ay and to do,
to propo&s;e and to object to, to contrive and to alter,
that, from the &s;implicity of the mi&s;tre&s;s, and the igno|rance
of the maid, the one was &s;oon l$d to conclude
&s;he &s;hould have appeared improperly before Mrs. Ber|linton,
without &s;uch u&s;eful advice; and the other to
believe &s;he mu&s;t &s;hortly have lo&s;t her place, now her
young lady was come forth into the world, if &s;he had
not thus miraculou&s;ly met with &s;o good a friend.</P>
<P><PB N="34" REF="35">
During the&s;e preparations, Camilla was &s;ummoned
back to the dining-room to receive Mr. We&s;twyn.</P>
<P>She did not hear this call with &s;erenity. The
danger which, however unwittingly, &s;he had cau&s;ed
his &s;on, and the &s;hocking circum&s;tances which were
its foundation, tinged her cheeks, and confounded her
wi&s;h of making acknowledgments, with an horror that
&s;uch an obligation could be po&s;&s;ible.</P>
<P>The door of the dining-room was open, and as &s;oon
as her &s;teps were heard, Mr. We&s;twyn came &s;miling
forth to receive her. She hung back involuntarily;
but, pacing up to her, and taking her hand, &startq;Well,
my good young lady,&endq; he cried, &startq;I have brought
you my &s;on; but he's no boa&s;ter, that I can a&s;&s;ure
you, for though I told him how you wanted him to
come to you, and was &s;o good as to &s;ay you were &s;o
much obliged to him, I can't make him own he has
ever &s;een you in his life; which I tell him is carrying
his mode&s;ty over far; I don't like affectation&mdash;I have
no ta&s;te for it.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, di&s;covering by this &s;peech, as well as by
his plea&s;ed and tranquil manner, that he had e&s;caped
hearing of the intended duel, and that his &s;on was &s;till
ignorant who&s;e cau&s;e he had e&s;pou&s;ed, ardently wi&s;hed
to avert farther &s;hame by concealing her&s;elf; and, &s;tep
by &s;tep, kept retreating back towards the room of
Eugenia; though &s;he could not di&s;engage her hand
from the old gentleman, who, trying to draw her on,
&s;aid: &startq;Come, my dear! don't go away. Though
my &s;on won't confe&s;s what he has done for you, he
can't make me forget that you were &s;uch a dear &s;oul
as to tell me your&s;elf, of his good behaviour, and of
your having &s;uch a kind opinion of him. And I have
been telling him, and I can a&s;&s;ure you I'll keep my
word, that if he has done a &s;ervice to the niece of
my dear old friend, Sir Hugh Tyrold, it &s;hall value
him fifty pounds a-year more to his income, if I
&s;traighten my&s;elf never &s;o much. For a lad, that
knows how to behave in that manner, will never
&s;pend his money &s;o as to make his old father a&s;hamed
of him. And that's a good thing for a man to know.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="35" REF="36">
&startq;Indeed, &s;ir, this is &s;ome mi&s;take,&endq; &s;aid the
young man him&s;elf, now advancing into the pa&s;&s;age,
while Camilla was &s;tammering out an excu&s;e from
entering; &startq;it's &s;ome great mi&s;take; I have not the
honour to know&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>He was going to add Mi&s;s Tyrold, but he &s;aw her
at the &s;ame moment, and in&s;tantly recollecting her
face, &s;topt, blu&s;hed, and looked amazed.</P>
<P>The retreating effort of Camilla, her &s;hame and her
pride, all &s;ub&s;ided by his view, and gave place to the
more generous feelings of gratitude for his intuitive
good opinion, and emotion for the ri&s;k he had run in
her defence; and with an expre&s;&s;ion of captivating
&s;weetne&s;s in her eyes and manner, &startq;That you did
not know me,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;makes the peculiarity of
your goodne&s;s, which, indeed, I am more &s;en&s;ible to
than I can expre&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why, there! there, now! there!&endq; cried Mr.
We&s;twyn, while his &s;on, enchanted to find who&s;e
character he had &s;u&s;tained, bowed almo&s;t to the
ground with re&s;pectful gratitude for &s;uch thanks;
&startq;only but li&s;ten! &s;he &s;ays the very &s;ame things to
your face, that &s;he &s;aid behind your back! though I
am afraid it's only to plea&s;e an old father; for if not,
I can't for my life find out any rea&s;on why you &s;hould
deny it. Come, Hal, &s;peak out, Hal!&endq;</P>
<P>Equally at a lo&s;s how either to avow or evade
what had pa&s;&s;ed in the pre&s;ence of Camilla, young
We&s;twyn began a &s;tammering an awkward apology;
but Camilla, feeling doubly his forbearance, &s;aid:
&startq;Silence may in you be delicate&mdash;but in me it would
be gracele&s;s.&endq; Then, turning from him to old Mr.
We&s;twyn, &startq;you may be proud, &s;ir,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;of
your &s;on! It was the honour of an utter &s;tranger he
was protecting, as helple&s;s as &s;he was unknown at the
time &s;he excited his intere&s;t; nor bad he even in view
this poor mede he now receives of her thanks!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My deare&s;t Hal!&endq; cried Mr. We&s;twyn, wringing
him by the hand; &startq;if you have but one &s;mall grain
of regard for me, don't per&s;i&s;t in denying this! I'd
<PB N="36" REF="37">
give the la&s;t hundred pounds I had in the world to be
&s;ure it was true!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;That to hear the name of this lady,&endq; &s;aid the
young man, &startq;&s;hould not be nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;pire me with
re&s;pect for her, who can wonder? that any opportu|nity
could ari&s;e in which &s;he &s;hould want defence, is
all that can give any &s;urpri&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You own it, then, my dear Hal? you own you've
done her a kindne&s;s? why then, my dear Hal, you've
done one to me! and I can't help giving you a hug
for it, let who will think me an old fool?&endq;</P>
<P>He then fervently embraced his &s;on, who confu&s;ed,
though gratified, &s;trove vainly to make di&s;claiming
&s;peeches. &startq;No, no, my dear Hal,&endq; he cried, &startq;you
&s;ha'n't let your&s;elf down with me again, I promi&s;e,
you, though you've two or three times tried to make
me think nothing of you; but this young lady here,
dear &s;oul, &s;peaks another language; &s;he &s;ays I may be
proud of my &s;on! and I dare &s;ay &s;he knows why, for
&s;he's a charming girl, as ever I &s;aw; &s;o I will be proud
of my &s;on! Poor dear Hal! thou ha&s;t got a good
friend. I can tell thee, in that young lady! and &s;he's
niece to the be&s;t man I ever knew; and I value her
good opinion more than any body's.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are much too good,&endq; cried Camilla, in an
accent of tender plea&s;ure, the re&s;ult of grateful joy,
that &s;he had not been the means of de&s;troying the pa|ternal
happine&s;s of &s;o fond a father, joined to the
dreadful certainty how narrowly &s;he had e&s;caped that
mi&s;ery; &startq;you are much too good, and I blu&s;h even
to thank you, when I think&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>What &s;he meant to add was in a moment forgotten,
and that &s;he blu&s;hed cea&s;ed to be metaphorical, when
now, as they all three entered the dining-room toge|ther,
the fir&s;t object that met her eyes was Edgar.</P>
<P>Their eyes met not again; delighted and con&s;ci|ous,
&s;he turned hers ha&s;tily away. He comes, thought
&s;he, to reclaim me! he will not &s;ubmit to the &s;epara|tion;
he comes to re-a&s;&s;ure me of his e&s;teem, and to
receive once more my faithful heart!</P>
<P><PB N="37" REF="38">
Edgar had &s;een, by chance, the We&s;twyns pa&s;s
to the room of the Cleves party, and felt the mo&s;t
ardent de&s;ire to know if they would meet with
Camilla, and what would be her reception of her
young champion, who&s;e &s;word, with extreme trou|ble,
he had him&s;elf that morning &s;heathed, and
who&s;e gallantry he attributed to a vehement, how|ever
&s;udden pa&s;&s;ion. Dr. Marchmont acknowledg|ed
the epoch to be highly intere&s;ting for ob&s;erva|tion,
and, pre&s;uming upon their old right of inti|macy
with all the party, they abruptly made a &s;e|cond
vi&s;it.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana, who were examin|ing
&s;ome goods &s;ent by Mrs. Mittin, had received
them all four without much mark of civility; and
Mr. We&s;twyn immediately de&s;ired Camilla to be
&s;ent for, and kept upon the watch, till her &s;tep
made him ha&s;ten out to meet her.</P>
<P>Edgar could not hear unmoved the dialogue
which en&s;ued; he imagined an amiable rival was
&s;uddenly &s;pringing up in young We&s;twyn, at the
very moment of his own di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, which he now
even thought po&s;&s;ible this incipient conque&s;t had
urged; and when Camilla, walking between the
father and the &s;on, with looks of &s;ofte&s;t &s;en&s;ibility,
came into the room, he thought he had never &s;een
her &s;o lovely, and that her mo&s;t bewitching &s;miles
were purpo&s;ely lavi&s;hed for their captivation.</P>
<P>With this idea, he found it impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak
to her; their &s;ituation, indeed, was too critical for
any common addre&s;s, and when he &s;aw that &s;he
turned from him, he attempted to conver&s;e with
the other ladies upon their purcha&s;es; and Camilla,
left to her two new beaux, had the unavoidable
appearance of being engro&s;&s;ed by them, though
the &s;ight of Edgar in&s;tantly robbed them of all
real attention.</P>
<P>Soon after, the door was again opened, and Mr.
Girt, the young per&s;umer, came, &s;mirking and
&s;craping, into the room with a box of various toys,
e&s;&s;ences, and co&s;metics, recommended by Mrs.
Mittin.</P>
<P><PB N="38" REF="39">
Ignorant of the mi&s;chief he had done her, and
not even recollecting to have &s;een him, Camilla
made one to look at his goods; but Edgar, to whom
his audacious a&s;&s;ertions were immediately brought
back by his fight, would have made him feel the
effects of his re&s;entment, had not his pa&s;&s;ion for
Camilla been of &s;o &s;olid, as well as warm a texture,
as to induce him to prefer guarding her delicacy,
to any po&s;&s;ible di&s;play he could make of his feel|ings
to others, or even to her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Mr. Girt, in the mid&s;t of his exhibition of me|morandum
books, &s;melling bottles, tooth-pick
ca&s;es, and pocket mirrors; with wa&s;hes to immor|talize
the &s;kin, powders becoming to all counte|nances,
and pomatums to give natural tre&s;&s;es to old
age, &s;uddenly recollected Camilla. The gro&s;s mi&s;|take
he had made he had already di&s;covered, by
having dodged her to the hou&s;e of Mrs Berlinton;
but all alarm at it had cea&s;ed, by finding, through
a vi&s;it made to his &s;hop by Mrs. Mittin, that &s;he
was uninformed he had propagated it. Not gifted
with the di&s;cernment to &s;ee in the air and manner
of Camilla her entire, though una&s;&s;uming &s;uperio|rity
to her accidental a&s;&s;ociate, he concluded them
both to be relations of &s;ome of the upper dome&s;tics;
and with a look and tone de&s;cending from the mo&s;t
profound adulation, with which he was pre&s;enting
his various articles to Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana,
into a familiarity the mo&s;t facetious, &startq;O dear,
ma'am,&endq; he cried, &startq;I did not &s;ee you at fir&s;t; I
hope t'other lady's well that's been &s;o kind as to
recommend me? Indeed I &s;aw her ju&s;t now.&endq;</P>
<P>Young We&s;twyn, to whom, as to Edgar, the bold
defamation of Girt occurred with his pre&s;ence,
but whom none of the namele&s;s delicacies of the
peculiar &s;ituation, and peculiar character of Edgar,
re&s;trained into &s;ilence, felt &s;uch a di&s;gu&s;t at the pre|&s;umption
of effrontery that gave him courage for
this facetious addre&s;s, to a young lady who&s;e inno|cence
of his ill u&s;age made him think its injury double,
<PB N="39" REF="40">
that unable to repre&s;s his indignation, he abruptly
whi&s;pered in his ear, &startq;Walk out of the room, &s;ir!&endq;</P>
<P>The amazed perfumer, at this haughty and un|expected
order, &s;tared, and cried aloud, &startq;No
offence, I hope, &s;ir?&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;twyn a&s;ked what was the matter? while
Camilla, crim&s;oned by the familiar a&s;&s;urance with
which &s;he had been addre&s;&s;ed, retired to a window.</P>
<P>&startq;Nothing of any moment, &s;ir,&endq; an&s;wered Hen|ry;
and again, in a low but &s;till more po&s;itive
voice, he repeated his command to Girt.</P>
<P>&startq;Sir, I'm not u&s;ed to be u&s;ed in this manner!&endq;
an&s;wered he, hardily, and hoping, by rai&s;ing his
tone, for the favourable intervention of the company.</P>
<P>Indiana, now, was preparing to &s;cream, and
Mi&s;s Margland was looking round to &s;ee whom
&s;he &s;hould reprehend; but young We&s;twyn, coolly
opening the door, with a &s;trong arm, and an able
$erk, twi&s;ted the perfumer into the pa&s;&s;age, &s;aying,
&startq;You may &s;end &s;omebody for your goods.&endq;</P>
<P>Girt, who equally &s;trong, but not equally adroit
as Henry, &s;trove in vain to re&s;i&s;t, vowed vengeance
for this a&s;&s;ault. Henry, without &s;eeming to hear
him, occupied him&s;elf with looking at what he had
left. Camilla felt her eyes &s;uffu&s;e with tears; and
Edgar, for the fir&s;t time in his life, found him&s;elf
vi&s;ited by the baleful pa&s;&s;ion of envy.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland could not comprehend what this
meant; Indiana comprehended but too much in
finding there was &s;ome di&s;turbance of which &s;he
was not the object; but Mr We&s;twyn, lo&s;ing his
look of delight, &s;aid, with &s;omething of &s;everity,
&startq;Hal! what did you turn that man out of the
room for?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He is perfectly aware of my rea&s;on, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid
Henry; and then added it was a long &s;tory, which
he begged to relate another time.</P>
<P>The blank face of Mr. We&s;twyn &s;hewed di&s;plea|&s;ure
and mortification. He lifted the head of his
cane to his mouth, and after biting it for &s;ome
time, with a frowning countenance, muttered, &startq;I
<PB N="40" REF="41">
don't like to &s;ee a man turned out of a room. If
he's done any harm, tell him &s;o; and if it's wor&s;e
than harm, &s;ou&s;e him in a hor&s;e-pond; I've no ob|jection:
But I don't like to &s;ee a man turned out of
a room; it's very unmannerly; and I did not think
Hal would do &s;uch a thing.&endq; Then &s;uddenly, and
with a &s;uccinct bow, bidding them all good bye, he
took a ha&s;ty leave; &s;till, however, muttering, all
the way along the pa&s;&s;age, and down the &s;tairs,
loud enough to be heard: &startq;Kicking and jerking a
man about does not prove him to be in the wrong.
I thought Hal had been more of a gentleman. If
I don't find the man turns out to be a ra&s;cal, Hal
&s;hall beg his pardon; for I don't like to &s;ee a man
turned out of a room.</P>
<P>Henry, who&s;e &s;pirit was as irritable as it was ge|nerous,
felt acutely this public cen&s;ure, which,
though &s;atisfied he did not de&s;erve, every &s;pecies
of propriety prohibited his explaining away. With
a forced &s;mile, therefore, and a &s;ilent bow, he fol|lowed
his father.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana now bur&s;t forth with a
torrent of wonders, conjectures and que&s;tions; but
the full heart of Camilla denied her &s;peech, and
the carriage of Mrs. Berlinton being already at the
door, &s;he called upon Eugenia, and followed, per|force,
by Mrs. Mittin, left the Hotel.</P>
<P>Edgar and Dr. Marchmont gave neither &s;urpri&s;e
nor concern by retiring in&s;tantly to their own
partment.</P>
<P>&startq;Dr. Marchmont,&endq; &s;aid the former, in a tone
of a&s;&s;umed moderation, &startq;I have lo&s;t Camilla! I
&s;ee it plainly. This young man &s;teps forward &s;o
gallantly, &s;o ingenuou&s;ly, nay &s;o amiably, that the
contra&s;t&mdash;chill, &s;evere, and repul&s;ive&mdash;mu&s;t render
me&mdash;in this dete&s;table &s;tate&mdash;in&s;upportable to all
her feelings. Dr. Marchmont! I have not a doubt
of the event!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The juncture, is, indeed, perilous, and the
trial of extreme&s;t hazard; but it is &s;uch as draws
all uncertainty to a cri&s;is, and, therefore, is not
<PB N="41" REF="42">
much to be lamented. You may &s;afely, I think,
re&s;t upon it your de&s;tiny. To a generous female
heart a duel is the mo&s;t dangerous of all a&s;&s;aults,
and the mo&s;t fa&s;cinating of all charms; and a duel|li&s;t,
though preci&s;ely what a woman mo&s;t &s;hould
dread, as mo&s;t expo&s;ing her to public notice, is the
per&s;on of all others &s;he can, commonly, lea&s;t re&s;i&s;t.
By this te&s;t, then, prove your Camilla. Her cham|pion
&s;eems evidently her admirer, and his father
her adorer. Her late engagement with you may
po&s;&s;ibly not reach them; or reaching but with its
di&s;&s;olution, &s;erve only to render them more eager.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do you &s;uppo&s;e him,&endq; cried Edgar, after a
pau&s;e of &s;trong di&s;turbance; &startq;do you &s;uppo&s;e
him rich?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Certainly not. That the addition of fifty
pounds a-year, to his income &s;hould be any object,
proves his fortune to be very moderate.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Clear her, then, at lea&s;t,&endq; &s;aid he, with a &s;o|lemnity
almo&s;t reproachful; &startq;clear her, at lea&s;t,
of every mercenary charge! If I lo&s;e her&mdash;&endq; he
ga&s;ped for breath&mdash;&startq;&s;he will not, you find, be
bought from me! and pique, anger, inju&s;tice, nay
incon&s;tancy, all are le&s;s deba&s;ing than the &s;ordid
corruption of which you &s;u&s;pected her.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;This does not, nece&s;&s;arily, prove her di&s;inter|e&s;ted;
&s;he is too young, yet, to know her&s;elf the
value &s;he may hereafter &s;et upon wealth. And,
independent of that inexperience, there is com|monly
&s;o little &s;tability, &s;o little internal hold, in
the female character, that any &s;udden glare of ad|ventitious
lure, will draw them, for the moment,
from any and every regular plan of &s;ub&s;tantial be|nefit.
It remains, therefore, now, to be tried, if
Beech Park, and its ma&s;ter united; can vie with
the bright and intoxicating incen&s;e of a life volun|tarily
ri&s;ked, in &s;upport&mdash;not of her fair &s;ame, that
was unknown to its defender&mdash;but &s;imply of the
fair countenance which &s;eemed its pledge.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar, heartle&s;s and &s;ad, attempted no further
argument; he thought the Doctor prejudiced again&s;t
<PB N="42" REF="43">
the merits of Camilla; yet it appeared, even to
him&s;elf, that her whole conduct, from the &s;hort
period of his open avowal, had &s;eemed a wilful &s;e|ries
of oppo&s;ition to his reque&s;ts and opinions.
And while terror for &s;urrounding dangers gave
weight to his di&s;approbation of her vi&s;iting South-hampton,
with a lady &s;he knew him to think more
attractive than &s;afe or re&s;pectable, her &s;ufferance
of the vulgar and forward Mrs. Mittin, with whom
again he &s;aw her quit the hotel, was yet more of|fen&s;ive,
&s;ince he could conceive for it no other in|ducement
than a carele&s;s, if not determined hu|mour,
to indulge every impul&s;e, in equal contempt
of his coun&s;el, and her own reflection.</P>
<P>All blame, however, of Camilla, was &s;hort of his
&s;elf-di&s;&s;atisfaction, in the di&s;tance impo&s;ed upon
him by uncertainty, and the coldne&s;s dictated by
di&s;cretion, at a period &s;o &s;en&s;itive, when her &s;pirit
was alarmed, and her delicacy was wounded, that
a &s;tranger &s;hould &s;tart forward, to vindicate her in|nocence,
and cha&s;ti&s;e its detractors, was &s;ingular,
was unfortunate, was nearly intolerable; and he
thought he could with thankfulne&s;s, have renounc|ed
half his fortune, to have been him&s;elf the &s;ole
protector of Camilla.</P>

<HEAD TYPE="sub">The Power of Prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THE two &s;i&s;ters were &s;ilent from the hotel to
the hou&s;e of Mrs. Berlinton.&mdash;From the height
of happie&s;t expectation, rai&s;ed by the quick
return of Edgar, Camilla was &s;unk into the lowe&s;t
de&s;pondence, by the abortive conclu&s;ion of the
meeting: while Eugenia was ab&s;orbed in mute joy,
<PB N="43" REF="44">
and wrapt in expectation. But Mrs. Mittin, un|di&s;turbed
by the pangs of uncertainty, and unoc|cupied
by any romantic per&s;ua&s;ion of bli&s;s, &s;poke
amply, with re&s;pect to quantity, for all three.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, though &s;omewhat &s;truck at fir&s;t
&s;ight of Eugenia with her &s;trange contra&s;t to Ca|milla,
received her with all the di&s;tingui&s;hing
kindne&s;s due to the &s;i&s;ter of her friend.</P>
<P>She had the poems of Collins in her hand; and,
at their joint de&s;ire, in&s;tead of putting the book
a&s;ide, read aloud, and with the tendere&s;t accent,
one of his mo&s;t plaintive odes.</P>
<P>Eugenia was enraptured. Ah! thought &s;he, this
is indeed the true &s;i&s;ter of the accompli&s;hed Mel|mond!&mdash;&s;he
&s;hall &s;hare with him my adoration.
My heart &s;hall be devoted&mdash;after my own dear fa|mily&mdash;to
the homage of their perfections!</P>
<P>The ode, to her great delight, la&s;ted till the din|ner
was announced, when Melmond appeared: but
her prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion could alone give any charm to his
&s;ight: he could barely recollect that he had &s;een
her, or even Camilla before; he had conver&s;ed
with neither; his eyes had been devoted to Indiana,
and the de&s;pondence which had become his portion
&s;ince the news of the marriage of his aunt, &s;eemed
but rendered the more peculiarly bitter, by this
intimate connection with the family of an object &s;o
adored.</P>
<P>Yet, though nothing could be more &s;piritle&s;s
than the hour of dinner, Eugenia di&s;covered in it
no deficiency; &s;he had previou&s;ly &s;ettled, that the
pre&s;ence of Melmond could only breathe &s;weets and
perfection, and the magic of prejudice works every
event into its own circle of expectation.</P>
<P>Melmond did not even accompany them back
to the drawing-room. Eugenia &s;ighed; but no|body
heard her. Mrs. Mitten &s;aid, &s;he had &s;ome|thing
of great con&s;equence to do in her own room,
and Mrs. Berlinton, to divert the languor &s;he
found creeping upon them all, had recour&s;e to
Hammond's elegies.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="45">
The&s;e were &s;till reading, when &s;ervant brought
in the name of Lord Valhur&s;t. &startq;O, deny me to
him! deny me to him!&endq; cried Mrs. Berlinton;
&startq;'tis a relation of Mr. Berlinton's and I hate
him.&endq;</P>
<P>The order was given, however, too late; he
entered the room.</P>
<P>The name, as Camilla knew it not, &s;he had heard
unmoved; but the &s;ight of a per&s;on who had &s;o
largely contributed to &s;hock and terrify her in the
bathing$ hou&s;e, &s;truck her with horror. Brought
up with the re&s;pect of other times, &s;he had ri&s;en at
his entrance; but &s;he turned &s;uddenly round upon
recollecting him, and in&s;tead of the court&s;ie &s;he in|tended
making, involuntarily moved away her
chair from the part of the room to which he was
advancing.</P>
<P>This was unnoticed by Mrs. Berlinton, who&s;e
chagrin at his intru&s;ion made her wi&s;h to walk
away al&s;o; while with Lord Valhur&s;t it only pa&s;&s;ed,
joined to her ri&s;ing, for a mark of her being but
little accu&s;tomed to company. That Eugenia ro&s;e
too was not perceived, as &s;he rather lo&s;t than
gained in height by &s;tanding.</P>
<P>Mo&s;t ob&s;equiou&s;ly, but mo&s;t un&s;ucce&s;sfully, the
peer made his court to Mrs. Berlinton; inquiring
after her health, with ful&s;ome tenderne&s;s, and ex|tolling
her good looks with nearly gro&s;s admiration.
Mrs. Berlinton li&s;tened, for &s;he was incapable of
incivility; though, weary and di&s;gu&s;ted, &s;he &s;eldom
made the &s;malle&s;t an&s;wer.</P>
<P>The two &s;i&s;ters might, with ea&s;e, equally have
e&s;caped notice, &s;ince, though Mrs. Berlinton occa|&s;ionally
addre&s;&s;ed them, the peer would never have
turned from her&s;elf, had not Mrs. Mitten, abruptly
entering in &s;earch of a pair of &s;ci&s;&s;ars, perceived
him, and ha&s;tily called out, &startq;O lauk, &s;ir, if it is not
you! I know you again well enough! But I hope,
now you &s;ee us in &s;uch good company as this good
lady's, you'll believe me another time, when I tell
you we're not the &s;ort of per&s;ons you took us for!
<PB N="45" REF="46">
Mi&s;s Tyrold, my dear, I hope you've &s;poke to the
gentleman?&endq;</P>
<P>Lord Valhur&s;t with difficulty recollected Mrs.
Mitten, from the very cur&s;ory view his otherwi&s;e
occupied eyes had taken of her; but when the
concluding words made him look at Camilla,
who&s;e youth and beauty were not &s;o liable to be
forgotten, he knew at once her a&s;&s;ociate, and was
aware of the meaning of her harangue.</P>
<P>Sorry to appear before his fair kin&s;woman to any
di&s;advantage, though by no means di&s;plea&s;ed at an
opportunity of again &s;eeing a young creature he
had thought &s;o charming, he began an apology to
Mrs. Mitten while his eyes were fixed upon Ca|milla,
vindicating him&s;elf from every intention
that was not re&s;pectful, and hoping &s;he did not &s;o
much injure as to mi&s;take him.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mitten was ju&s;t beginning to an&s;wer that
&s;he knew better, when the words, &startq;Why, my
Lord, how have you offended Mrs. Mitten?&endq;
dropping from Mrs. Berlinton, in&s;tantly new
&s;trung all her notions. To find him a nobleman
was to find him innocent; for, though &s;he did not
quite &s;uppo&s;e that a peer was not a mortal, &s;he had
never &s;poken to one before; and the power of
title upon the ear, like that of beauty upon the
eye, is, in its fir&s;t novelty, all-commanding; mani|fold
as are the drawbacks on the influence of either,
when awe is lo&s;t by familiarity and habitual re|flection
takes place of ca&s;ual and momentary admi|ration.
Title then, as well as beauty, demands
mental auxiliaries; and tho&s;e who po&s;&s;e&s;s either,
more watched than the common race, &s;eem of
higher re&s;pon&s;ibility; but proportioned to the
cen&s;ure they draw where they err, is the veneration
they in&s;pire where their eminence is complete. Nor
is this the tribute of prejudice, as tho&s;e who look up
to all &s;uperiority with envy love to aver; the impar|tial
and candid reflectors upon human frailty, who, in
viewing it, &s;ee with its elevation its &s;urrounding
temptations, will call it but the tribute of ju&s;tice.</P>
<P><PB N="46" REF="47">
To Mrs. Mitten, however, the mere found of a title
was enough; &s;he felt its a&s;cendance without examin|ing
its claims, and, dropping the lowe&s;t court&s;ie her
knees could &s;upport, confu&s;edly &s;aid, &s;he hoped his
lord&s;hip would excu&s;e her &s;peaking &s;o quick and im|properly,
which &s;he only did from not knowing who
he was; for, if &s;he had known him better, &s;he &s;hould
have been &s;ure he was too much the gentleman to do
any thing with with an ill de&s;ign.</P>
<P>His lord&s;hip courteou&s;ly accepted the apology; and
advanced to Camilla, to expre&s;s his hopes &s;he had not
participated in &s;uch injurious &s;u&s;picions.</P>
<P>She made no an&s;wer, and Mrs. Be$linton inquired
what all this meant?</P>
<P>&startq;I prote&s;t, my dear madam,&endq; &s;aid the peer, &startq;I do
not well comprehend my&s;elf. I only &s;ee there has
been &s;ome mi&s;under&s;tanding; but I hope this young
lady will believe me, when I declare, upon my ho|nour,
that I had no view but to offer my protection, at
the time I &s;aw her under alarm.&endq;</P>
<P>This was a declaration Camilla could not di&s;pute,
and even felt inclined to credit, from the &s;olemnity
with which it was uttered; but to di&s;cu&s;s it was
every way impo&s;&s;ible, and therefore, coldly bowing
her head, &s;he &s;eemed acquie&s;cent.</P>
<P>Lord Valhur&s;t now pretty equally divided his at|tention
between the&s;e two beautiful young women;
looking at and complimenting them alternately, till a
&s;ervant came in and &s;aid, &startq;The two Mr. We&s;twyns
de&s;ire to &s;ee Mi&s;s Tyrold.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla did not wi&s;h to avoid per&s;ons to whom &s;he
was &s;o much obliged, but begged &s;he might receive
them in the next apartment, that Mrs. Berlinton might
not be di&s;turbed.</P>
<P>The eager old gentleman &s;tood with the door in
one hand, and his &s;on in the other, awaiting her.
&startq;My dear young lady,&endq; he cried, &startq;I have been
hunting you out for hours. Your good governe&s;s had
not a mind to give me your direction, thinking me, I
&s;uppo&s;e, but a trouble&s;ome old fellow; and I did not
know which way to turn, till Hal found it out. Hal's
<PB N="47" REF="48">
pretty quick. So now, my dear young lady, let me
tell you my errand; which I won't be tedious in, for
fear, another time, you may rather not &s;ee me. And
the more I &s;ee you, the le&s;s I like to think &s;uch
a thing. However, with all my good will to
make ha&s;te, I mu&s;t premi&s;e one thing, as it is but
fair. Hal was quite again&s;t my coming upon this
bu&s;ine&s;s. But I don't think it the le&s;s right for that;
and &s;o I come. I never yet &s;aw any good of a man's
being ruled by his children. It only &s;erves to make
them think their old fathers &s;uperannuated. And if
once I find Hal taking &s;uch a thing as that into his
head, I'll cut him of with a &s;hilling, well as I love
him.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Your menace, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid Henry, colouring, though
&s;miling, &startq;gives me no alarm, for I &s;ee no danger.
But&mdash;&s;hall we not detain Mi&s;s Tyrold too long from
her friends?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ay now, there comes in what I take notice to be
the ta&s;te of the pre&s;ent day! a lad can hardly enter
his teens, before he thinks him&s;elf wi&s;er than his father,
and gives him his coun&s;el, and tells him what he
thinks be&s;t. And, if a man i'n't upon his guard, he
may be run down for an old dotard, before he knows
where he is, and &s;ee his &s;on &s;etting up for a member
of parliament, making laws for him. Now this is
what I don't like; &s;o I keep a tight hand upon Hal,
that he mayn't do it. For Hal's but a boy, ma'am,
though he's &s;o clever. Not that I pretend I'd change
him neither, for e'er an old fellow in the three king|doms.
Well, but, now I'll you what I come for.
You know how angry I was about Hal's turning that
man out of the room? well, I took all the pains I
could to come at the bottom of the fray, intending, all
the time, to make Hal a&s;k the man's pardon; and
now what do you think is the end? Why, I've
found out Hal to be in the right! The man proves to
be a worthle&s;s fellow, that has defamed the niece of
my dear Sir Hugh Tyrold; and if Hal had la&s;hed him
with a cat-o'nine-tails, I &s;hould have been glad of it.
I can't &s;ay I &s;hould have found fault. So you &s;ee,
<PB N="48" REF="49">
my dear young lady, I was but a cro&s;s old fellow, to
be &s;o out of &s;orts with poor Hal.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, with mingled gratitude and &s;hame, of|fered
her acknowledgements; though what &s;he heard
a&s;toni&s;hed, if po&s;&s;ible, even more than it mortified her.
How in the world, thought &s;he, can I have provoked
this &s;lander?</P>
<P>She knew not how little provocation is nece&s;&s;ary for
calumny; nor how regularly the common herd,
where appearances admit two interpretations, decide
for the wor&s;t. Girt de&s;igned her neither evil nor good;
but not knowing who or what &s;he was, &s;imply filled
up the doubts in his own mind, by the bias of his own
character.</P>
<P>Confu&s;ed as much as her&s;elf, Henry propo&s;ed imme|diately
to retire; and, as Camilla did not invite them
to &s;tay, Mr. We&s;twyn could not refu&s;e his con&s;ent:
though, &s;ending his &s;on out fir&s;t, he &s;topt to &s;ay,
in a low voice, &startq;What do you think of Hal, my dear
young lady? I'n't he a brave rogue? And did not
you tell me I might be proud of my &s;on? And &s;o I
am, I promi&s;e you! How do you think my old
friend will like Hal? I &s;hall take him to Cleves.
He's another &s;ort of lad to Ma&s;ter Clermont! I
hope, my dear young lady, you don't like your cou&s;in?
He's but a &s;ad &s;park, I give you my word. Not a bit
like Hal.&endq;</P>
<P>When the carriage came for Eugenia, who was &s;elf|per&s;uaded
this day was the mo&s;t felicitous of her life,
&s;he went &s;o $$luctantly, that Mrs. Berlinton, caught
by her delight in the vi&s;it, though un&s;u&s;picious of its
motive, invited her to renew it the next morning.</P>
<P>At night, Mrs. Mittin, following Camilla to her
chamber, &s;aid, &startq;See here, my dear! what do you
&s;ay to this? Did you ever &s;ee a prettier cloak? look
at the cut of it, look at the capes! look at the mode!
And as for the lace, I don't think all Southampton can
produce its fellow; what do you &s;ay to it, my dear?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What every body mu&s;t &s;ay to it, Mrs. Mittin;
that it's remarkably pretty.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="49" REF="50">
&startq;Well, now try it on. There's a &s;et! there's a
fall off the &s;houlders! do but look at it in the gla&s;s.
I'd really give &s;omething you could but &s;ee how it be|comes
you Now, do pray, only tell me what you
think of it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Always the &s;ame, Mrs. Mittin; that it's ex|tremely
pretty.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear, then, now comes out the &s;e|cret!
It's your own! you may well &s;tare; but it's
true; it's your own, my dear!&endq;</P>
<P>She demanded an explanation; and Mrs. Mittin &s;aid,
that, having taken notice that her cloak looked very
mean by the &s;ide of Mrs. Berlinton's, when &s;he com|pared
them together, &s;he re&s;olved upon &s;urpri&s;ing her
with a new one as quick as po&s;&s;ible. She had, there|fore,
got the pattern of Mrs. Berlinton's and cut it
out, and then got the mode at an haberda&s;her's, and
then the lace at a milliner's, and then &s;et to work &s;o
hard, that &s;he had got it done already.</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;eeing the materials were all infinitely
richer than any &s;he had been accu&s;tomed to wear, was
extremely chagrined by &s;uch officiou&s;ne&s;s, and gravely
inquired how much this would add to her debts.</P>
<P>&startq;I don't know yet, my dear; but I had all the
things as cheap as po&s;&s;ible; but as it was not all at
one &s;hop, I can't be clear as to the exact &s;um.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, who had determined to avoid even the
&s;hadow of a debt, and to forbear every po&s;&s;ible expence
till &s;he had not one remaining, was now not merely
vexed, but angry. Mrs. Mittin, however, upon who&s;e
feelings that mo&s;t trouble&s;ome of all qualities to its
po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors, delicacy, never obtruded, went on, extoll|ing
her own performance, and prai&s;ing her own good
nature, without di&s;covering that either were imperti|nent;
and, was &s;o far from conceiving it po&s;&s;ible they
could be unwelcome, that &s;he attributed the concern
of Camilla to mode&s;ty, on account of her trouble;
and mi&s;took her di&s;plea&s;ure for di&s;tre&s;s, what &s;he could
do for her in return. And, indeed, when &s;he fini&s;hed
her double panegyric upon the cloak and its maker,
with confe&s;&s;ing &s;he had &s;at up the whole night, in
<PB N="50" REF="51">
order to get it done, Camilla con&s;idered her&s;elf as too
much obliged to her intention to reproach any further
its want of judgment; and concluded by merely in|treating
&s;he would change her note, pay for it imme|diately,
di&s;charge her other accounts with all &s;peed,
and make no future purcha&s;e for her what&s;oever.</P>

<P>EUGENIA failed not to ob&s;erve her appointment
the next morning, which was devoted to elegiac
poetry. A ta&s;te &s;o &s;imilar operated imperceptibly upon
$word$. Berlinton, who detained her till &s;he was com|pelled
to return to prepare for a great hall at the pub|lic
rooms; the profound deliberations of Mi&s;s Marg|land,
how to exhibit her fair pupil, having fini&s;hed,
$word$ mo&s;t deliberations upon &s;uch &s;ubjects, by doing
that which is done by every body el&s;e upon the &s;ame
occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>Sir Hugh had given directions to Mi&s;s Margland to
clear his three $eces equally of all expences relative
to public places. Camilla, therefore, being entitled
to a ticker, and having brought with her whatever
was un&s;poilt of her Tunbridge apparel, thought this
the mo&s;t &s;ea&s;onable opportunity &s;he could take for
again &s;eeing Edgar, who, in their pre&s;ent delicate
&s;ituation, would no longer, probably, think it right to
inquire for her at a &s;tranger's.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton had not purpo&s;ed appearing in pub|lic,
till &s;he had formed her own party; but an irre|pre&s;&s;ible
curio&s;ity to &s;ee Indiana induced her to accom|pany
Camilla, with no other attendant than Lord
Valhur&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin &s;ought vainly to be of the party; Mrs.
Berlinton, though permitting her &s;tay in her hou&s;e,
<PB N="51" REF="52">
and treating her with con&s;tant civility, had no idea
of including her in her own &s;ociety, which &s;he aimed
to have always di&s;tingui&s;hed by either rank, talents,
or admirers: and Camilla, who now felt her integrity
involved in her economy, was firm again&s;t every hint
for a&s;&s;i&s;ting her with a ticket.</P>
<P>Lord Valhur&s;t, who alone, of the fa&s;hionable &s;o|journers,
had yet di&s;covered the arrival of Mrs. Ber|linton,
was highly gratified by this opportunity of
attending two &s;uch fair creatures in public.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, as u&s;ual, was the la&s;t to enter the
room; for &s;he never began the duties of the toilette
till after tea-time. Two &s;uch youthful beauties were
not likely to pa&s;s without ob&s;ervation. Mrs. Berlin|ton,
already no longer new to it, had alternately the
air of receiving it with the mo&s;t winning mode&s;ty, or
of not noticing &s;he received it at all: for though, but
a few months &s;ince, &s;he had &s;carcely been even &s;ee$
by twenty per&s;ons, and even of tho&s;e had never met a
fixed eye without a blu&s;h, the feelings are &s;o often the
mere concomitants of the habits, that &s;he could now
already know her&s;elf the principal object of a whole
a&s;&s;embly, without any &s;en&s;ation of timidity, or ap|pearance
of confu&s;ion. To be hold was not in her
nature, which was &s;oft and amiable; but admiration
is a dangerous a&s;&s;aulter of diffidence, and familiarity
makes almo&s;t any di&s;tinction met unmoved.</P>
<P>Camilla was too completely engro&s;&s;ed by her heart,
to think of her appearance.</P>
<P>Lord Valhur&s;t, from his time of life, &s;eemed to be
their father, though his adulating air as little &s;uited
that character as his inclination. He &s;carce knew
upon which mo&s;t to lavi&s;h his compliments, or to
regale his eyes, and turned, half expiring with exta&s;y,
from the &s;oft charms of his kin&s;woman, with &s;ome|thing,
he thought, re&s;embling animation, to the more
quickening influence of her bright-eyed companion.</P>
<P>But the effect produced upon the company at large
by the radiant beauty of Indiana, who had entered
&s;ome time, was &s;till more &s;triking than any immediate
powers from all the bewitching graces of Mrs. Ber|linton,
<PB N="52" REF="53">
a$d all the intelligent loveline&s;s of Camilla.
Her faultle&s;s face, her perfect form, rai&s;ed wonder in
one &s;ex, and overpowered envy in the other. The
men looked at her, as at &s;omething almo&s;t too cele&s;tial
for their devoirs; the women, even the mo&s;t charming
among&s;t them, &s;aw them&s;elves di&s;tanced from all pre|ten&s;ions
to rivalry. She was followed, but not ap|proached;
gazed at, as if a &s;tatue, and inquired
after, rather as a prodigy than a mortal.</P>
<P>This awful homage &s;pread not, however, to her
party; the watchful but di&s;dainful eyes of Mi&s;s
Margland obtained for her&s;elf, even with u&s;ury, all
the haughty contempt they be&s;towed upon others:
Eugenia was pronounced to be a foil, brought merely
in ridicule: and Dr. Orkborne, whom Mi&s;s Margland,
though dete&s;ting, forced into the &s;et, in preference to
being without a man, to band them from the carriage,
and to call it for them at night, had a look &s;o forlorn
and di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, while obliged to parade with them up
and down the room, that he &s;eemed rather a pri&s;oner
than an e&s;quire, and more to require a guardian to
prevent his e&s;caping him&s;elf, than to &s;erve for one in
&s;ecuring his young charges from any attack.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland augured nothing &s;hort of half a
&s;core propo&s;als of marriage the next day, from the
evident brilliancy of this fir&s;t opening into life of her
beautiful pupil; who&s;e own eyes, while they dazzled
all others, &s;ought eagerly tho&s;e of Melmond, which
they meant to vanqui&s;h, if not annihilate.</P>
<P>The fir&s;t care of Mi&s;s Margland was to make her&s;elf
and her young ladies known to the ma&s;ter of the cere|monies.
Indiana needed not that precaution to be im|mediately
the choice of the mo&s;t elegant man in the
room; yet &s;he was piqued, not delighted, and Mi&s;s
Margland felt &s;till more irritated, that he proved to
be only a baronet, though a obleman, at the &s;ame
time, had pre&s;ented him&s;elf to Eugenia. It is true
the poet was ruined; but his title was unimpaired;
and though the fortune of the baronet, like his per&s;on,
was in its pri$e, Indiana thought her&s;elf degraded by
<PB N="53" REF="54">
his hand, &s;ince the partner of her cou&s;in was of &s;upe|rior
rank.</P>
<P>Eugenia, in&s;en&s;ible to this honour, looked only for
Melmond; not like Indiana, &s;plendidly to &s;ee and
kill, but &s;ilently to view and venerate. Melmond,
however, was not there; he kn$w his little command
over his pa&s;&s;ion, in pre&s;ence of its object; he knew,
too, that the expence of public places was now beyond
the propriety of his income, and virtuou&s;ly devoted
his ev$ning to his &s;ick aunt.</P>
<P>Edgar had waited impatiently the entrance of Ca|milla.
His momentary &s;ight of L$rd Valhur&s;t, at the
bathing room, did not bring him to his remembrance
in his pre&s;ent more &s;h$wy apparel, and he was gra|tified
to &s;ee only an old $word$ in her immediate &s;uite.
He did not deem it proper, as they were now cir|cum&s;tanced,
to a&s;k her to dance; but he quietly ap|proached
and bowed to her, and addre&s;&s;ed &s;ome civil
inquiries to Mrs. Berlinton. The We&s;twyns had
waited for her at the door; and the father had imme|diately
made her give her hand to Henry to join the
dancers.</P>
<P>&startq;That's a charming girl,&endq; cried old Mr. We&s;twyn,
when &s;he was gone; &startq;a very charming girl, I pro|mi&s;e
you. I have taken a prodigious liking to her;
and &s;o has Hal.&endq;</P>
<P>Revived by this open &s;peech, which made him hope
there was no &s;erious de&s;ign, Edgar &s;miled upon the
old gentleman, who had addre&s;&s;ed it to the whole
remaining party; and &s;aid, &startq;You have not known
that young lady long, I believe, &s;ir?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No, &s;ir; but a little while; but that I don't
mind. A long while and a &s;hort while is all one,
when I like a per&s;on; for I don't think how many
years they've got over their heads &s;ince fir&s;t I &s;aw
them, but how many good things they've got on the
in&s;ide their hearts to make me want to &s;ee them
again. Her uncle's the deare&s;t friend I have in the
world; and when I go from this place, I &s;hall make
him a vi&s;it; for I'm &s;ure of a welcome. But he has
never &s;een my Hal. However, that good girl will
<PB N="54" REF="55">
he &s;ure to &s;peak a kind word for him, I know; for
&s;he thinks very well of him; &s;he told me her&s;elf, I
might be proud of my &s;on. I can't &s;ay but I've loved
the girl ever &s;ince for it.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar was &s;o much plea&s;ed with the perfectly na|tural
character of this old gentleman, that, though
alarmed at his intended call upon the favour of Sir Hugh,
through the influence of Camilla, for Henry, he would
yet have remained in his &s;ociety, had he not been
driven from it by the junction of young Lynmere,
who&s;e &s;hallow in&s;olence he thought in&s;upportable.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who declined dancing, had arrived
&s;o late, that when Henry led back Camilla, the com|pany
was &s;ummoned to the tea-table. She was lan|gui&s;hing
for an introduction to Indiana, the ab&s;ence
of Me$mond obviating all pre&s;ent objection to their
meeting; &s;he therefore gave Camilla the welcome ta&s;k
to propo&s;e that the two parties &s;hould unite.</P>
<P>Many years had elap&s;ed &s;ince Mi&s;s Margland had
received &s;o &s;en&s;ible a gratification; and, in the coa|lition
which took place, &s;he di&s;played more of civility
in a few minutes, than &s;he had exerted during the whole
period of her York&s;hire and Cleves re&s;idence.</P>
<P>Notwith&s;tanding all &s;he had heard of her charms,
Mrs. Berlinton &s;till &s;aw with &s;urpri&s;e and admiration
the exqui&s;ite face and form of the cho&s;en of her
brother, whom &s;he now &s;o &s;incerely bewailed, that, had
her own wealth been per&s;onal or transferrable, &s;he
would not have he&s;itated in &s;haring it with him, to aid
his better &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>Lord Valhur&s;t adhered tenaciou&s;ly to his kin&s;|woman;
and the three gentlemen who had danced the
la&s;t dances with Indiana, Eugenia, and Camilla,
a&s;&s;etted the privilege of attending their partners at the
tea-table.</P>
<P>In a few minutes, Lynmere, coming up to them,
with &startq;Well, have you got any thing here one can
touch?&endq; leant his hand on the edge, and his whole
body over the table, to take a view at his ea&s;e of its
contents.</P>
<P><PB N="55" REF="56">
&startq;Suppo&s;e there were nothing, &s;ir?&endq; &s;aid old
We&s;twyn; &startq;look round, and &s;ee what you could
want.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Really, &s;ir,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, between whom
and Camilla, Lynmere had &s;queezed him&s;elf a place,
&startq;you don't u&s;e much ceremony!&endq;</P>
<P>Having taken &s;ome tea, he found it intolerable,
and &s;aid he mu&s;t have a gla&s;s of Champaign$.</P>
<P>&startq;La, brother!&endq; cried Indiana, &startq;if you bring
any win$, I can't bear to &s;tay.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland &s;aid the &s;ame; but he whi&s;tled, and
looked rou$d him without an&s;wering.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who, though &s;he had thought his
uncommonly fine per&s;on an excu&s;e for his intru&s;ion,
thought nothing could excu&s;e this ill-breeding, pro|po&s;ed
they &s;hould leave the tea-table, and walk.</P>
<P>&startq;Sit &s;till, ladies,&endq; &s;aid Mr. We&s;twyn, &startq;and
drink your tea in peace.&endq; Then, turning to Lynmere,
&startq;I wonder,&endq; he cried, &startq;you an't a&s;hamed of your|&s;elf!
If you were a &s;on of mine, I'll tell you what;
I'd lock you up! I'd &s;erve you as I did when I car|ried
you over to Leip&s;ic, eight years ago. I always
hated pert boys. I can't fancy 'em.&endq;</P>
<P>Lynmere, affecting not to hear him, though in|wardly
firing, called violently after a waiter; and,
in mere futile vengeance, not only gave in order for
Champaigne, but demanded &s;ome Stilton chee&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Chee&s;e!&endq; exclaimed Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;if you
order any chee&s;e. I can't &s;o much as &s;tay in the
room. Think what a nau&s;eous &s;mell it will make$&endq;</P>
<P>The man an&s;wered they had no Stilton chee&s;e in the
hou&s;e, but the very be&s;t of every other &s;ort.</P>
<P>Lynmere, who had only given this command to
&s;hew his defiance of control, &s;eized, with equal a$i|dity,
the opportunity to abu&s;e the waiter; affirming
he belonged to the wor&s;t &s;erved hotel in Chri&s;tendom.</P>
<P>The man walked off in dudgeon, and Mr.
We&s;twyn, lo&s;ing his anger in his a&s;toni&s;hment at this
effrontery, &s;aid, &startq;And pray, Mr. Lynmere, what
do you pretend to know of Stilton chee&s;e? do they
make it at Leip&s;ie? did you ever &s;o much as ta&s;te it
in your life?&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="56" REF="57">
&startq;O, yes! excellent! excellenti&s;&s;imo! I can eat
no other.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Eat no other! it's well my Hal don't &s;ay the
&s;ame! I'd churn him to a chee&s;e him&s;elf if he did!
And pray Mr. Lynmere, he &s;o good as to let me
know how you got it there?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ways and means, &s;ir; ways and means!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why you did not &s;end acro&s;s the &s;ea for it?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;A travelled man, &s;ir, thinks no more of what
you call acro&s;s the &s;ea, than you, that live always
over your own fire-&s;ide, think of &s;tepping acro&s;s a
kennel.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, &s;ir, well,&endq; &s;aid the old gentleman, now
very much piqued,! &startq;I can't but &s;ay I feel &s;ome con|cern
for my old friend, to have his money dou&s;ed about
at &s;uch a rantipole rate. A boy to be &s;ending over
out of Germany into England for Stilton chee&s;e! I
wi&s;h it had been Ha$ with all my heart! I promi&s;e
you I'd have given him enough of it. If the lea&s;t
little thought of the kind was but once to have got in
his head, I'd have taken my b &s;t oaken &s;tick, and
have done him the good office to have helped it out
for him: and have made him thank me after too!
I hate daintine&s;s; e&s;pecially in boys. I have no great
patience with it.&endq;</P>
<P>Only more incen&s;ed, Lynmere called aloud for his
Champaigne. The waiter civilly told him, it was
not u&s;ual to bring wine during tea: but he p$r&s;i&s;ted;
and Mr. We&s;tywn, who &s;aw the ladies all ri&s;ing, au|thoritatively,
told the waiter to mind no &s;uch direc|tions.
Lynmere, who had entered the ball-room in
his riding-dre&s;s, rai&s;ed a &s;witch at the man, which he
dur&s;t not rai&s;e at Mr. We&s;twyn, and prote&s;ted, in a
threatening attitude, he would lay it acro&s;s his &s;houl|ders,
if he obeyed not. The man, ju&s;tly provoked,
thought him&s;elf authori&s;ed to &s;natch it from him:
Clerm$$t re&s;i&s;ted; a fierce &s;cuffle en&s;ued; and though
Henry, by immediate intervention, could have parted
them, Mr. We&s;tywn in&s;i&s;ted there &s;hould he no inter|ference,
&s;aying, &startq;If any body's helped, let it be the
waiter; for he's here to do his duty: he don't come
<PB N="57" REF="58">
only to behave unmannerly, for his own plea&s;ure.
And if I &s;ee him hard run, it's odds but I lend him
my own fi&s;t to right him.&mdash;I like fair play.&endq;</P>
<P>The female party, in very &s;erious alarm at this un|plea&s;ant
&s;cene, ro&s;e to hurry away. Lord $alhur&s;t
was ambitious to &s;uffice as guardian to both his fair
charges; but Henry, when prohibited from &s;topping
the affray, offered his &s;ervices to Camilla, who could
not refu&s;e them; and Mrs. Berlinton, active and im|patient,
flew on foremo&s;t; with more &s;peed than his
lord&s;hip could follow, or even keep in fight. Indiana
was handed out by her new adorer, the young baro|net;
and Eugenia was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by her new a&s;&s;ailer, the
young nobleman.</P>
<P>Edgar, who had hurried to Camilla at the fir&s;t tu|mult,
was &s;tung to the heart to &s;ee who handed her
away; and, forcing a pa&s;&s;age, followed, till Henry,
the envied Henry, depo&s;ited her in the carriage of
Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>The confu&s;ion in the room, meanwhile, was not
likely &s;oon to decrea&s;e, for old Mr. We&s;twyn, de|lighted
by this mortifying cha&s;ti&s;ement to Clermont,
would permit neither mediation nor a&s;&s;i&s;tance on his
&s;ide; &s;aying, with great glee, &startq;It will do him a
great deal of good! My poor old friend will ble&s;s
me for it. This is a better le&s;&s;on than he got in all
Leip&s;ic. Let him feel that a Man's a Man; and not
take it into his head a per&s;on's to &s;tand &s;till to be
&s;witched, when he's doing his duty, according to his
calling. Switching a man is a bad thing. I can't &s;ay
I like it. A gentleman &s;hould always u&s;e good words;
and then a poor man's proud to &s;erve him; or, if he's
in&s;olent for nothing, he may trounce him and wel|come.
I've no objection.&endq;</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland, meanwhile, had not been remi&s;s in
what &s;he e&s;teemed a mo&s;t capital feminine accompli&s;h|ment,
&s;creaning; though, in its exerci&s;e, &s;he had
failed of any &s;ucce&s;s, &s;ince, while her voice called
remark, her countenance repelled its effect. Yet as
&s;he &s;aw that not one lady of the group retreated un|attended,
&s;he thought it a di&s;grace to &s;eem the only
<PB N="58" REF="59">
female, who, from internal courage, or external ne|glect,
&s;hould retire alone; &s;he therefore called upon
Dr. Orkborne, conjuring, in a &s;hrill and pathetic
voice, meant more for all who &s;urrounded than for
him&s;elf, that he would protect her.</P>
<P>The Doctor, who had kept his place in defiance of
all &s;ort of inconvenience, either to him&s;elf or to
others; and who, with &s;ome curio&s;ity, was viewing
the combat, which he was mentally comparing with
certain pugili&s;tic games of old, was now, for the fir&s;t
time in the evening, receiving &s;ome little entertainment,
and therefore compo&s;edly an&s;wered, &startq;I have a very
good place here, ma'am; and I would rather not quit
it till this &s;cene is over.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;So you won't come, then, Doctor?&endq; cried &s;he,
modulating into a &s;oft whine the voice which rage,
not terror, rendered tremulous.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne, who was any thing rather than lo|quacious,
having given one an&s;wer, &s;aid no more.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland appealed to all pre&s;ent upon the
indecorum of a lady's being kept to witne&s;s &s;uch un|becoming
violence, and upon the unheard-of inatten|tion
of the Doctor: but a &s;hort, &startq;Certainly!&mdash;&endq;
&startq;To be &s;ure, ma'am!&mdash;&endq; or, &startq;It's very &s;hocking
indeed!&endq; with a ha&s;ty decampment from her neigh|bourhood,
was all of &s;ympathy &s;he procured.</P>
<P>The entrance, at length, of the ma&s;ter of the
hou&s;e, &s;topt the affray, by calling off the waiter.
Clermont, then, though wi&s;hing to extirpate old
We&s;twyn from the earth, and ready to eat his own
fle&s;h with fury at the double di&s;grace he had endured,
affected a loud halloo, as if he had been contending
for his amu&s;ement; and prote&s;ting Bob, the waiter,
was a fine fellow, went off with great apparent &s;atis|faction.</P>
<P>&startq;Now, then, at lea&s;t, &s;ir,&endq; cried Mi&s;s Margland,
imperiou&s;ly to the Doctor, who, &s;till ruminating upon
the late conte&s;t, kept his &s;eat, &startq;I &s;uppo&s;e you'll
conde&s;cend to take care of me to the coach?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;The&s;e modern clothes are very much in the
way,&endq; &s;aid the Doctor, gravely; &startq;and give a bad
<PB N="59" REF="60">
effect to attitudes.&endq; He ro&s;e, however, but not
knowing what <HI>to take care of a lady to a coach</HI> meant,
&s;tood re&s;olutely &s;till, till &s;he was forced, in de&s;pera|tion,
to walk on alone. He then &s;lowly followed,
keeping many paces behind, notwith&s;tanding her con|tinually
looking back; and when, with a heavy &s;igh
at her hard fate, &s;he got, una&s;&s;i&s;ted, into the carriage,
where her young ladies were waiting, he tranquilly
mounted after her, tolerably reconciled to the lo&s;s of
his evening, by &s;ome new annotations it had &s;ugge&s;ted
for his work, relative to the games of antiquity.</P>
</DIV2>
<DIV2 N="8" TYPE="chapter">
<HEAD>CHAP. VIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Youthful Effu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>CAMILLA now thought her&s;elf &s;afe in harbour;
the &s;torms all over, the dangers all pa&s;t, and but
a light gale or two wanting to make good her landing
on the bo&s;om of permanent repo&s;e. This gale, this
propitious gale, &s;he thought ready to blow at her cal$:
for &s;he deemed it no other than the breath of jealou&s;y.
She had &s;een Edgar, though he knew her to be pr$|$ected,
follow her to the coach, and &s;he had &s;een, by
the light afforded from the lamps of the carriage, th$t
her &s;afety from the crowd and tumult was not the &s;ole
object of his watchfulne&s;s, &s;ince though that, at the
in&s;tant &s;he turned round, was obviou&s;ly &s;ecure, his
countenance exhibited the &s;tronge&s;t marks of di&s;tur|bance.
The &s;ecret &s;pring, therefore, &s;he now thought,
that was to re-unite them, was in her own po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion</P>
<P>All the coun&s;els of Mrs. Arlbery upon this &s;ubject
occurred to her; and imagining &s;he had hitherto erred
from a &s;imple facility, &s;he rejoiced in the accident
which had pointed her to a &s;afer path, and &s;hewn her
that, in the pre&s;ent di&s;ordered &s;tate of the opinions of
<PB N="60" REF="61">
Edgar, the only way to a la&s;ting accommodation was
to alarm his &s;ecurity, by a&s;&s;erting her own independ|ence.</P>
<P>Her difficulty, however, was &s;till con&s;iderable as to
the means. The &s;evere puni&s;hment &s;he had received,
and the &s;elf blame and penitence &s;he had incurred,
from her experiment with Sir Sedley Clarendel, all
rendered, too, abortive, by Edgar's contempt of the
object, determined her to &s;uffer no hopes, no feelings
of her own, to engro&s;s her ever more from weighing
tho&s;e of another. The end, therefore, of her deli|beration
was to &s;hew general gaiety, without appro|priate
favour, and to renew &s;olicitude on his part by
a di&s;played ea&s;e of mind on her own.</P>
<P>Elated with this idea &s;he determined upon every
po&s;&s;ible public exhibition by which &s;he could execute
it to the be&s;t advantage. Mrs. Berlinton had but to
appear, to &s;ecure the mo&s;t fa&s;hionable per&s;ons at
Southampton for her parties, and &s;oon renewed the
&s;ame cour&s;e of life &s;he had lived at Tunbridge, of
&s;eeing company either at home or abroad every day,
except when &s;ome accidental plan offered a &s;cheme of
more novelty.</P>
<P>Upon all the&s;e occa&s;ions, young We&s;twyn, though
wholly un&s;ought, and even unthought of by Camilla,
was in&s;tinctively and incautiou&s;ly the mo&s;t alert to
&s;econd her plan; he was her fir&s;t partner when &s;he
danced, her con&s;tant attendant when &s;he walked, and
always in wait to conver&s;e with her when &s;he was
&s;eated; while, not purpo&s;ing to engage him, &s;he per|ceived
not his fa&s;t growing regard, and intending to
be open to all alike, ob&s;erved not the thwarting effect
to her de&s;ign of this peculiar a&s;&s;iduity.</P>
<P>By old Mr. We&s;twyn this intercour&s;e was yet more
urgently forwarded. Bewitched with Camilla, he
carried his &s;on to her wherever &s;he appeared, and &s;aid
aloud to every body but her&s;elf: &startq;If the boy and
girl like one another, they &s;hall have one another;
and I won't inquire what &s;he's worth; for &s;he thinks &s;o
well of my &s;on, that I'd rather he'd have her than
an empre&s;s. Money goes but a little way to make
<PB N="61" REF="62">
people happy; and true love's not a thing to be got
every day; &s;o if &s;he has a mind to my Hal, and Hal
has a mind to her, why, if they have not enough,
he mu&s;t work hard and get more. I don't like to cro&s;s
young peop$e. Better let a man labour with his hands,
than fret away his &s;pirit. Neither a boy nor a girl are
good for much when they've got their hearts broke.&endq;</P>
<P>This new experiment of Camilla, like every other
deduced from fal&s;e rea&s;oning, and formed upon fal&s;e
principles, was flattering in its promi&s;e, pernicious in
its progre&s;s, and abortive in its performance. Edgar
&s;aw with agony what he conceived the a&s;cendance of
a new attachment built upon the declen&s;ion of all
regard for him&s;elf; and in the fir&s;t horror of his appre|hen&s;ions,
would have re&s;i&s;ted the &s;upplanter by en|forcing
his own final claim; but Dr. Marchmont
repre&s;ented that, &s;ince he had heard in &s;ilence his right
to that claim &s;olemnly withdrawn, he had better fir&s;t
a&s;certain if this apparent connection with young
We&s;twyn were the motive, or only the con&s;equence
of that re&s;umption: &startq;If the fir&s;t be the ca&s;e,&endq; he
added, &startq;you mu&s;t tru&s;t her no more: a heart &s;o in|flammable
as to be kindled into pa&s;&s;ion by a mere acci|dental
blaze of gallantry and valour, can have nothing
in con&s;onance with the cha&s;te purity and fidelity your
character requires and merits: If the la&s;t, inve&s;tigate
whether the net in which &s;he is entangling her&s;elf is
that of levity, delighting in change, or of pique, di&s;|gui&s;ing
its own agitation in efforts to agitate others.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Alas!&endq; cried the melancholy Edgar, &startq;in either
ca&s;e, &s;he is no more the artle&s;s Camilla I fir&s;t adored!
that fatal connection at the Grove, formed while her
character, pure, white, and &s;potle&s;s, was in its en|chanting,
but dangerous &s;tate of fir&s;t ductility, has
already broken into that clear tran&s;parent &s;inglene&s;s of
mind, &s;o beautiful in its total ignorance of every &s;pe|cies
of &s;cheme, every &s;ort of double mea&s;ure, every
idea of &s;ecret view and latent expedient!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Repine not, however, at the connection till you
know whether &s;he owes to it her defects, or only their
manife&s;tation. A man &s;hould &s;ee the woman he would
<PB N="62" REF="63">
marry in many &s;ituations, ere he can judge what chance
he may have of happine&s;s with her in any. Though
now and then 'tis a ble&s;&s;ed, 'tis always a perilous &s;tate;
but the man who has to weather its &s;torms, &s;hould
not be remi&s;s in &s;tudying the clouds which precede
them.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, Doctor! by this delay&mdash;by the&s;e experi|ments&mdash;&s;hould
I lo&s;e her!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;If by finding her unworthy, where is the lo&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar &s;ighed, but acknowledged this que&s;tion to be
unan&s;werable.</P>
<P>&startq;Think, my dear young friend, what would be
your &s;ufferings to di&s;cover any radical, inherent fail|ing,
when irrem$diably her's! run not into the very
common error of depending upon the gratitude of
your wife after marriage, for the in$quality of her
fortune before your union. She who has no fortune
at all, owes you no more for your alliance, than &s;he
who has thou&s;ands; for you do not marry her becau&s;e
&s;he has no fortune! you marry her becau&s;e you think
&s;he has &s;ome endowment, mental or per&s;onal, which
you conclude will conduce to your happine&s;s; and
&s;he, on her part, accepts you, becau&s;e &s;he &s;uppo&s;es
you or your &s;ituation will contribute to her's The
object may be different, but neither &s;ide is indebted to
the other, &s;ince each has &s;elf, only, in contempla|tion;
and thus, in fact, rich or poor, high or low,
whatever be the previous di&s;tinction between the par|ties,
on the hour of marriage they begin as equals.
The obligation and the debt of gratitude can only
commence when the knot is tied: &s;elf, then, may
give way to &s;ympathy; and whichever, from that
moment, mo&s;t con&s;iders the other, becomes immedi|ately
the creditor in the great account of life and
happine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>While Camilla, in gay ignorance of danger, and
awake only to hope, pur&s;ued her new cour&s;e, Euge|nia
had the infinite delight of improving daily and
even hourly in the good graces of Mrs. Berlinton;
<PB N="63" REF="64">
who &s;oon di&s;covered how wide from ju&s;tice to that
excellent young creature was all judgment that
could be formed from her appearance. She found
that &s;he was as elegant in her ta&s;te for letters as
her&s;elf, and far more deeply cultivated in their
knowledge; that her manners were gentle, her &s;en|timents
were elevated, yet that her mind was hum|ble;
the &s;ame authors delighted and the &s;ame pa&s;&s;a|ges
&s;truck them; they met every morning; they
thought every morning too &s;hort, and their friend|&s;hip,
in a very few days, knit by &s;o many bands of
&s;ympathy, was as fully e&s;tabli&s;hed as that which al|ready
Mrs. Berlinton had formed with Camilla.</P>
<P>To Eugenia this treaty of amity was a delicious
poi&s;on, which, while it enchanted her faculties by
day, preyed upon her vitals by night. She fre|quently
&s;aw Melmond, and though a melancholy
bow was almo&s;t all the notice &s;he ever obtained
from him, the countenance with which he made it,
his air, his figure, his face, nay his very dre&s;s, for
the half in&s;tant he be&s;towed upon her, occupied
all her thoughts till &s;he &s;aw him again, and had
another to con over and dwell upon.</P>
<P>Melmond, inexpre&s;&s;ibly wretched at the depriva|tion
of all hope of Indiana, at the very period when
fortune &s;eemed to favour his again pur&s;uing her,
dreamt not of this partiality. His time was devoted
to deliberating upon &s;ome lucrative &s;cheme of fu|ture
life, which his literary turn of mind rendered
difficult of &s;election, and which his refined love of
&s;tudy and retirement made hateful to him to un|dertake.</P>
<P>He was kind, however, and even con&s;oling to
his aunt, who &s;aw his nearly de&s;olate &s;tate with a
compunction bitterly increa&s;ed by finding &s;he had
thrown their joint properties, with her own per|&s;on,
into the hands of a rapacious tyrant. To
&s;often her repentance, and allow her the &s;oothing
of all &s;he could &s;pare of her own time, Mrs. Ber|linton
invited her to her own hou&s;e. Mr. Ul&s;t, of
cour&s;e included in the invitation, made the removal
<PB N="64" REF="65">
with alacrity, not for the plea&s;ure it procured his
wife, but for the money it &s;aved him&s;elf; and Mrs.
Mittin voluntarily re&s;igned to them the apartment
&s;he had cho&s;en for her own, by way of a little peace-offering
for her unde&s;ired length of &s;tay; for &s;till,
though ince&s;&s;antly Camilla inquired for her ac|count,
&s;he had received no an&s;wer from her credi|tors,
and was obliged to wait for another and ano|ther
po&s;t.</P>
<P>Mrs. Ul&s;t, though not well enough, at pre&s;ent,
to &s;ee company, and at all times, fanatically aver&s;e
to every &s;pecies of recreation, could not entirely
avoid Eugenia, who&s;e vi&s;its were con&s;tant every
morning, and who&s;e expected inheritance made a
&s;imilar wi&s;h occur for her nephew, with that which
had di&s;po&s;ed of her niece; for &s;he flattered her&s;elf
that if once &s;he could &s;ee them both in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion
of great wealth, her mind would be more at ea&s;e.</P>
<P>She communicated this idea to Mr. Ul&s;t, who,
mo&s;t willing, al&s;o, to get rid of the reproach of the
poverty and ruin of Melmond, imparted it with
&s;trong exhortation for its promotion, to the young
man; but he heard with di&s;dain the mercenary
project, and prote&s;ted he would daily labour for
his bread, in preference to pro&s;tituting his probity,
by &s;oliciting a regard he could never return, for
the acquirement of a fortune which he never
could merit.</P>
<P>Mr. Ul&s;t, much too hard to feel this as any re|flection
upon him&s;elf, applied for the intere&s;t of
Mrs. Berlinton; but &s;he &s;o completely thought
with her brother, that &s;he would not interfere,
till Mr. Ul&s;t made &s;ome ob&s;ervations upon Eugenia
her&s;elf, that inclined her to waver.</P>
<P>He &s;oon remarked, in that young and artle&s;s
character, the &s;ymptoms of the partiality &s;he had
conceived in favour of Melmond, which, when
once pointed out, could not be mi&s;taken by Mrs.
Berlinton, who, though more than equally &s;u&s;cep|tible
with Eugenia, was &s;elf-occupied, and &s;aw nei|ther
her emotion at his name, nor her timid air at
<PB N="65" REF="66">
his approach, till Mr. Ul&s;t, who&s;e di&s;cernment had
been quickened by his wi&s;hes, told her when, and
for what, to look.</P>
<P>Touched now, her&s;elf, by the double happine&s;s
that might en&s;ue, from a gratified choice to Euge|nia,
and a noble fortune to her brother, &s;he took
up the cau&s;e, with delicacy, yet with pity; repre|&s;enting
all the charming mental and intellectual
accompli&s;hments of Eugenia, and be&s;eeching him
not to &s;acrifice both his intere&s;t and his peace, in
&s;ubmitting to a hopele&s;s pa&s;&s;ion for one object,
while he inflicted all its horrors upon another.</P>
<P>Melmond, amazed and &s;oftened, li&s;tened and
&s;ighed; but prote&s;ted &s;uch a change, from all of
beauty to all of deformity, was impracticable; and
that though he revered the character &s;he painted,
and was &s;en&s;ible to the honour of &s;uch a preference,
he mu&s;t be ba&s;e, double, and perjured, to take ad|vantage
of her great, yet unaccountable goodne&s;s,
by heartle&s;s profe&s;&s;ions of feigned participation.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, to whom &s;entiment was irre&s;i&s;t|able,
urged the matter no longer, but wept over
her brother, with compa&s;&s;ionate admiration.</P>
<P>Another day only pa&s;&s;ed, when Mrs Mittin
picked up a paper upon the &s;tairs, which &s;he &s;aw
fall from the pocket of Eugenia, in drawing out her
handkerchief, but which, determined to read ere &s;he
returned, &s;he found contained the&s;e lines.</P>
<P>O Rea&s;on! friend of the troubled brea&s;t guide
of the wayward fancy, moderator of the flights
of hope, and &s;inkings of de&s;pair, Eugenia calls

</LG>
<P>Overjoyed by the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the important
&s;ecret this little juvenile effu&s;ion of tenderne&s;s be|trayed,
Mrs. Mittin ran with it to Mrs Berlinton,
and without mentioning &s;he had &s;een whence the
paper came, &s;aid &s;he had found it upon the &s;tairs:
for even tho&s;e who have too little delicacy to attri|bute
to treachery a clande&s;tine indulgence of curi|o&s;ity,
have a certain in&s;tinctive &s;en&s;e of its unfair|ne&s;s,
which they evince without avowing, by the
care with which they &s;often their motives, or
their manner, of according them&s;elves this &s;pecies
of gratification.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who &s;crupulou&s;ly would have
withheld from looking into a letter, could not &s;ee
a copy of ver&s;es, and recognize the hand of Euge|nia,
already known to her by frequent notes, and
refrain reading. That &s;he &s;hould find any thing
per&s;onal, did not occur to her; to peru&s;e, there|fore,
<PB N="67" REF="68">
a manu&s;cript ode or &s;onnet, which the humi|lity
of Eugenia might never voluntarily reveal,
cau&s;ed her no he&s;itation; and &s;he ran through the
lines with the warme&s;t delight, till, coming &s;ud|denly
upon the end, &s;he bur&s;t into tears, and flew
to the apartment of her brother.</P>
<P>She put the paper into his hand without a word,
He read it ha&s;tily. Surpri&s;ed, confounded, di&s;|ordered,
he looked at his &s;i&s;ter for &s;ome explana|tion
or comment; &s;he was &s;till &s;ilently in tears;
he read it again, and with yet greater emotion;
when, holding it back to her, &startq;Why, my &s;i&s;ter,&endq;
he cried, &startq;why would &s;he give you this? why
would you deliver it? Ah! leave me, in pity, firm
in integrity, though fallen in fortune.!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My brother, my dear brother, this matchle&s;s
creature merits not &s;o degrading an idea; &s;he gave
me not the precious paper&mdash;&s;he knows not I po&s;|&s;e&s;s
it; it was found upon the &s;tairs: Ah! far from
thus openly confe&s;&s;ing her unhappy prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion,
&s;he conceals it from every human being; even her
beloved &s;i&s;ter, I am convinced, is untru&s;ted; upon
paper only &s;he has breathed it, and breathed it as
you &s;ee&mdash;with a genero&s;ity of &s;oul that is equal to
the delicacy of her conduct.&endq;</P>
<P>Melmond now felt &s;ubdued. To have excited
&s;uch a regard in a mind that &s;eemed &s;o highly cul|tivated,
and &s;o naturally elegant, could not &s;ail to
to touch him; and the concluding line deeply pe|netrated
him with tender though melancholy grati|tude.
He took the hand of his &s;i&s;ter, returned her
the paper, and was going to &s;ay: &startq;Do whatever
you think proper;&endq; but the idea of lo&s;ing all right
to adore Indiana checked and &s;ilenced him; and
mournfully telling her he required a little time for
reflection, he entreated to be left to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>He was not &s;uffered to ruminate in quiet; Mrs.
Mittin, proud of having anything to communicate
to a relation of Mrs. Berlinton's, made an oppor|tunity
to &s;it with Mrs. Ul&s;t, purpo&s;ely to commu|nicate
to her the di&s;covery that Mi&s;s Eugenia
<PB N="68" REF="69">
Tyrold was in love with, and wrote ver&s;es upon,
her nephew. Melmond was in&s;tantly &s;ent for; the
important &s;ecret was enlarged upon with remon|&s;trances
&s;o pathetic, not to throw away &s;uch an
invitation to the mo&s;t brilliant good fortune, in
order to ca&s;t him&s;elf, with his vainly nouri&s;hed
pa&s;&s;ion, upon immediate hard&s;hips, or la&s;ting penu|ry;
that rea&s;on as well as intere&s;t, compelled him
to li&s;ten; and, after a &s;evere conflict, he gave his
reluctant promi&s;e to &s;ee Eugenia upon her next
vi&s;it, and endeavour to bias his mind to the con|nexion
that &s;eemed likely to en&s;ue.</P>
<P>Camilla who was in total ignorance of the whole
of this bu&s;ine&s;s, received, during the dinner, an in|coherent
note from her &s;i&s;ter, conjuring that &s;he
would &s;earch immediately, but privately, in her
own chamber, in the dre&s;&s;ing-room of Mrs. Berlin|ton,
in the hall, and upon the &s;tairs, for a paper
in her hand-writing, which &s;he had &s;omewhere
lo&s;t, but which &s;he be&s;ought her, by all that &s;he
held dear, not to read when &s;he found; prote&s;ting
&s;he &s;hould &s;hut her&s;elf up for ever from the whole
world, if a &s;yllable of what &s;he had written on
that paper were read by a human being.</P>
<P>Camilla could not endure to keep her &s;i&s;ter a
moment in this &s;u&s;pen&s;ive &s;tate, and made an ex|cu&s;e
for quitting the table that &s;he might in&s;tantly
&s;eek the manu&s;cript. Melmond and Mrs. Berlin|ton
both conjectured the contents of the billet,
and felt much for the mode&s;t and timid Eugenia;
but Mrs. Mittin could not confine her&s;elf to &s;ilent
&s;ugge&s;tion; &s;he ro&s;e al&s;o, and running after Ca|milla,
&s;aid: &startq;My dear Mi&s;s, has your &s;i&s;ter &s;ent
to you to look for any thing?&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla a&s;ked the meaning of her inquiry; and
&s;he then owned &s;he had picked up, from the
&s;tairs, a &s;ort of love letter, in which Mi&s;s Euge|nia
had wrote couplets upon Mr. Melmond.</P>
<P>Inexpre&s;&s;ibly a&s;toni&s;hed, Camilla demanded their
re&s;toration; this &s;oon produced a complete expla|nation,
and while, with equal &s;urpri&s;e and concern,
<PB N="69" REF="70">
&s;he learnt the &s;ecret of Eugenia, and its di&s;covery to
its object, &s;he could not but re&s;pect and honour all &s;he
&s;he had gathered from Mrs Berlinton of the behaviour
of her brother upon the detection; and his equal free|dom
from pre&s;umptuous vanity, or mercenary projects,
induced her to believe her &s;i&s;ter's choice, though wholly
new to her, was well founded; and that if he could
conquer his early propen&s;ity for Indiana, he &s;eemed,
of all the characters &s;he knew&punc; Edgar alone and always
excepted, the mo&s;t peculiarly formed for the happine&s;s
of Eugenia.</P>
<P>She begged to have the paper, and entreated her
&s;i&s;ter might never know into who&s;e hands it had fallen.
This was cheerfully agreed to; but Mrs. Mittin, dur|ing
the conference, had already flown to Eugenia, and
amid&s;t a torrent of offers of &s;ervice, and profe&s;&s;ions of
power to do any thing &s;he plea&s;ed for her, &s;uffered her
to &s;ee that her attachment was betrayed to the whole
hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The agony of Eugenia was exce&s;&s;ive; and &s;he re|&s;olved
to keep her chamber ti$l &s;he returned to Cleves,
that &s;he might neither &s;ee nor be &s;een any more by
Melmond nor his family. Scarce could &s;he bear to be
broken in upon even by Camilla, who tenderly ha&s;ten|ed
to con&s;ole her. She hid her blu&s;hing con&s;cious
face, and prote&s;ted &s;he would inhabit only her own
apartment for the re&s;t of her life.</P>
<P>The active Mrs. Mittin failed not to carry back the
hi&s;tory of this re&s;olution; and Melmond, to his un|&s;peakable
regret in being thus precipitated, thought
him&s;elf called upon in all decency and propriety to an
immediate declaration. He could not, however, a&s;&s;ume
fortitude to make it in per&s;on; nor yet was his mind
&s;ufficiently compo&s;ed for writing; he commi&s;&s;ioned,
therefore, his &s;i&s;ter to be the bearer of his overtures.</P>
<P>He charged her to make no mention of the ver&s;es,
which it was fitting &s;hould, on his part, pa&s;s unnoticed,
though &s;he could not but be &s;en&s;ible his pre&s;ent addre&s;s
was their con&s;equence; he de&s;ired her &s;imply to &s;tate
his high reverence for her virtues and talents, and his
his con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of the inadequacy of his preten&s;ions
<PB N="70" REF="71">
to any claim upon them, except what aro&s;e from the
grateful integrity of e&s;teem with which her happine&s;s
&s;hould become the fir&s;t object of his future life, if &s;he
forbade not his application for the con&s;ent of Sir Hugh
and Mr. Tyrold to &s;olicit her favour.</P>
<P>With re&s;pect to Indiana, he begged her, unle&s;s
que&s;tioned, to be wholly &s;ilent. To &s;ay his flame for
that adorable creature was extingui&s;hed would be ut|terly
fal&s;e; but his peace, as much as his honour,
would lead him to combat, henceforth, by all the
means in his power, his ill-fated and woe-teeming
pa&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>This commi&s;&s;ion was in perfect con&s;onance with
the feelings of Mrs. Berlinton, who, though with
difficulty the gained admi&s;&s;ion, executed it with the
mo&s;t tender delicacy to the terrified Eugenia, who,
amazed and trembling, pale and incredulous, &s;o little
under&s;tood what &s;he heard, &s;o little was able to believe
what &s;he wi&s;hed, that, when Mrs. Berlinton, with
an affectionate embrace, begged her an&s;wer, &s;he a&s;ked
if it was not Indiana of whom &s;he was &s;peaking!</P>
<P>Mrs Berlinton then thought it right to be explicit;
&s;he acknowledged the early pa&s;&s;ion of her brother for
that young lady, but &s;tated that, long before he had
ventured to think of her&s;elf, he had determined its
conque&s;t; and that what originally was the prudence
of compul&s;ion, was now, from his altered pro&s;pects in
life, become choice: &startq;And believe me,&endq; added &s;he,
from my long and complete knowledge of the honour
and the delicacy of his opinion, as well as of the ten|derne&s;s
and gratitude of his nature, the woman who
&s;hall once receive his vows, will find his life devoted
to the &s;tudy of her happine&s;s.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia flew into her arms, hung upon her bo&s;om,
wept, blu&s;hed, &s;miled, and &s;ighed, alternately; one
moment wi&s;hed Indiana in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her fortune,
the next thought &s;he her&s;elf, in all but beauty, more
formed for his felicity, and ultimately gave her tacit
but tran&s;ported con&s;ent to the application.</P>
<P>Melmond, upon receiving it, heaved what he fondly
hoped would be his la&s;t &s;igh for Indiana, and ordering
<PB N="71" REF="72">
his hor&s;e, &s;et off immediately for Cleves and Ether|ington;
determined frankly to &s;tate his &s;mall income
and cru&s;hed expectations; and feeling almo&s;t equally
indifferent to acceptance or rejection.</P>
<P>Camilla devoted the afternoon to her agitated but
enraptured &s;i&s;ter, who de&s;ired her &s;ecret might &s;pread
no further, till the will of her father and uncle &s;hould
decide its fate; but the loquacious Mrs. Mittin, hav|ing
&s;ome cheap ribands and fine edgings to recommend
to Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana, could by no means
refrain from informing them, at the &s;ame time, of the
di&s;covered manu&s;cript.</P>
<P>&startq;Poor thing!&endq; cried Indiana, &startq;I really pity her.
I don't think,&endq; imperceptibly gliding towards the
gla&s;s; &startq;I don't think, by what I have &s;een of Mr.
Melmond, &s;he has much chance; I've a notion he's
rather more difficult.</P>
<P>&startq;Really this is what I always expected!&endq; &s;aid
Mi&s;s Margland; &startq;It's ju&s;t exactly what one might
look for from one of your learned educations, which
I always de&s;pi&s;ed with all my heart. Writing love
ver&s;es at fifteen! Dr. Orkborne's made a fine hand
of her! I always hated him, from the very fir&s;t.
However, I've had nothing to do with the bringing
her up, that's my con&s;olation! I thank Heaven I
never made a ver&s;e in my life! and I never intend
it.&endq;</P>

<P>CAMILLA left her &s;i&s;ter to accompany Mrs. Berlin|ton
to the Rooms; no other mode remaining for &s;eeing
Edgar, who, &s;ince her rejection, had held back from
repeating his attempt of vi&s;iting Mrs. Berlinton.</P>
<P>In mutual &s;olicitude, mutual watchfulne&s;s, and
mutual trials of each other's hearts and e&s;teem, a week
<PB N="72" REF="73">
had already pa&s;&s;ed, without one hope being extirpated,
or one doubt allayed. This evening was &s;omewhat
more, though le&s;s plea&s;antly deci&s;ive.</P>
<P>Accident, want of due con&s;ideration, and &s;udden
recollection, in an agitated moment, of the worldly
doctrine of Mrs. Arlbery, had led Camilla, once more,
into the &s;emblance of a character, which, without
thinking of, &s;he was acting. Born &s;imple and ingenu|ous,
and bred to hold in horror every &s;pecies of art,
all idea of coquetry was foreign to her meaning,
though an untoward contrariety of circum&s;tances,
playing upon feelings too potent for deliberations,
had eluded her into a conduct as mi&s;chievous in its
e&s;&s;ects, and as wide from artle&s;&s;ne&s;s in its appearance,
as if &s;he had been brought up and nouri&s;hed in fa&s;hi|onable
egoti&s;m.</P>
<P>Such, however, was not Camilla: her every pro|pen&s;ity
was pure, and, when reflection came to her
aid, her conduct was as exemplary as her wi&s;hes.
But the ardour of her imagination, acted upon by
every pa&s;&s;ing idea, &s;hook her judgment from its yet
un&s;teady &s;eat, and left her at the mercy of wayward
Sen&s;ibility&mdash;that delicate, but irregular power, which
now impels to all that is mo&s;t di&s;intere&s;ted for others,
now forgets all mankind, to watch the pul&s;ations of its
own fancies.</P>
<P>This evening brought her back to recollection.&mdash;Young
We&s;tywn, urged by what he deemed encou|ragement,
and prompted by his impatient father,
&s;poke of his intended vi&s;it to Cleves, and introduction
to Sir Hugh, in terms of &s;uch animated plea&s;ure, and
with a manner of &s;uch open admiration, that &s;he could
not mi&s;take the &s;erious purpo&s;es which he meant to
imply.</P>
<P>Alarmed, &s;he looked at him; but the expre&s;&s;ion of
his eyes was not &s;uch as to &s;till her &s;u&s;picions.
Frightened $t what now &s;he fir&s;t ob&s;erved, &s;he turned
from him, $$vely&punc; meaning to avoid conver&s;ing with
him the re&s;t $word$ the evening; but her caution came too
late; her fir&s;t $$vilities had flattered both him and his
father into a belief of her favour, and this &s;udden
<PB N="73" REF="74">
drawback he imputed only to virgin mode&s;ty, which
but added to the fervour of his devoirs.</P>
<P>Camilla now perceived her own error: the per&s;eve|rance
of young We&s;twyn not merely &s;tartled, but
appalled her. His character, una&s;&s;uming, though
&s;pirited, was marked by a general decency and pro|priety
of demeanour, that would not pre&s;umptuou&s;ly
brave di&s;tancing; and awakened her, therefore, to a
review of her own conduct, as it related, or as it
might &s;eem, to him&s;elf.</P>
<P>And here not all the guiltle&s;&s;ne&s;s of her intentions
could exonerate her from blame with that finely &s;cru|tinizing
monitor to which Heaven, in pity to tho&s;e
evil propen&s;ities that law cannot touch, nor &s;ociety
reclaim, has devolved its earthly juri&s;diction in the
human brea&s;t. With her hopes &s;he could play, with
her wi&s;hes &s;he could trifle, her intentions &s;he could
de&s;end, her de&s;igns &s;he could relinqui&s;h&mdash;but with her
con&s;cience &s;he could not combat. It pointed beyond
the pre&s;ent moment; it took her back to her impru|dence
with Sir Sedley Clarendel, which &s;hould have
taught her more circum&s;pection; and it carried her on
to the di&s;appointment of Henry and his father, whom
while heedle&s;sly &s;he had won, though without the
mo&s;t remote view to beguile, &s;he might &s;eem artfully to
have caught, for the wanton vanity of rejecting.</P>
<P>While advice and retro&s;pection were thus alike
oppre&s;&s;ive in accu&s;ation, her pen&s;ive air and withdrawn
&s;miles proved but more endearing to young We&s;twyn,
who&s;e internal interpretation was &s;o little adapted to
render them formidable, that his a&s;&s;iduities were but
more tender, and allowed her no repo&s;e.</P>
<P>Edgar, who with the mo&s;t &s;uffering &s;u&s;pen&s;e, ob|&s;erved
her unu&s;ual &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s, and its effect upon
Henry, drew from it, with the cu&s;tomary ingenuity
of &s;en&s;itive minds to torment them&s;elves, the &s;ame infe|rence
for his cau&s;ele&s;s torture, as proved to his rival a
delu&s;ive ble&s;&s;ing. But while thus he contemplated
Henry as the mo&s;t envied of mortals, a new &s;cene
called forth new &s;urpri&s;e, and gave birth to yet new
doubts in his mind. He &s;aw Camilla not merely turn
<PB N="74" REF="75">
wholly away from his rival, but enter into conver&s;a|tion,
and give, apparently, her whole attention to
Lord Valhur&s;t, who, it was palpable, only &s;poke to her
of her charms, which, alternately with tho&s;e of Mrs.
Berlinton, he devoted his whole time to wor&s;hipping.</P>
<P>Camilla by this action, meant &s;imply to take the
quicke&s;t road &s;he &s;aw in her power to &s;hew young
We&s;twyn his mi&s;take. Lord Valhur&s;t &s;he held nearly
in aver&s;ion; for, though his vindication of his up|right
motives at the bathing-hou&s;e, joined to her in|difference
in con&s;idering him either guilty or innocent,
made her conclude he might be blamele&s;s in that tran&s;|action,
his perpetual compliments, enforced by &s;tar|ing
eyes and tender glances, wearied and di&s;gu&s;ted
her. But he was always by her &s;ide, when not in the
&s;ame po&s;ition with Mrs Berlinton; and while his
readine&s;s to engage her made this her ea&s;ie&s;t expedi|ent,
his time of life per&s;uaded her it was the &s;afe&s;t.
Little aware of the effect this produced upon Edgar,
&s;he imagined he would not more notice her in any
conver&s;ation with Lord Valhur&s;t, than if &s;he were
di&s;cour&s;ing with her uncle.</P>
<P>But while &s;he judged from the &s;incerity of reality,
&s;he thought not of the mi&s;chief of appearance. What
in her was de&s;igned with innocence, was rendered
&s;u&s;picious to the ob&s;ervers by the looks and manner
of her companion. The plea&s;ure with which he found,
at la&s;t, that incen&s;e received, which hitherto had been
&s;lighted, gave new ze&s;t to an adulation which, while
Camilla endured merely to &s;hew her coldne&s;s to young
We&s;twyn, &s;eemed to Edgar to be offered with a gro&s;s
pre&s;umption of welcome, that mu&s;t re&s;ult from an
opinion it was addre&s;&s;ed to a confirmed coquette.</P>
<P>Offended in his inmo&s;t &s;oul by this idea, he &s;carce
de&s;ired to know if &s;he were now &s;timulated mo&s;t by a
wi&s;h to torment Henry, or him&s;elf, or only by the
general plea&s;ure &s;he found in this now mode of amu&s;e|ment.
&startq;Be it,&endq; cried he to Dr. Marchmont, &startq;as
it may, with me all is equally over! I &s;eek not to
recall an attachment liable to &s;uch intermi&s;&s;ions, &s;uch
<PB N="75" REF="76">
commotions. What would be my peace, my tran|quillity,
with a companion &s;o un&s;table? A mind all
at large in its pur&s;uits?&mdash;a di&s;&s;ipated wife!&mdash;No!&mdash;I
will remain here but to let her know I acquie&s;ce in
her di&s;mi&s;&s;ion, and to learn in what form &s;he has
communicated our breach to her friends.&endq;</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont was &s;ilent, and they walked out
of the room together; leaving the deceived Camilla
per&s;uaded he was &s;o indifferent with regard to the old
peer, that all her influence was lo&s;t, and all her late
exertions were thrown away, by one evening's re|mi&s;&s;ne&s;s
in exciting his fears of a young rival.</P>
<P>Melmond returned to Southampton the next morn|ing
with an air of deep and &s;ettled melancholy. He
had found the two brothers together, and the candour
of his appearance, the plainne&s;s of his declaration,
the openne&s;s with which he &s;tated his &s;ituation, and
his near relation&s;hip to Mrs. Berlinton, procured him
a courteous hearing; and he &s;oon &s;aw that both the
father and the uncle, though they de&s;ired time for
con&s;ideration and inquiry, were di&s;po&s;ed to favour
him. Mr. Tyrold, though, to his acknowledged
recent di&s;appointment of fortune, he attributed his
addre&s;s, had &s;o little hope that any man at once ami|able
and rich would pre&s;ent him&s;elf to his unfortunate
Eugenia, that, when he &s;aw a gentleman well edu|cated,
well allied, of plea&s;ing manners, and with
every external promi&s;e of a good and feeling charac|ter,
mode&s;tly, and with no profe&s;&s;ions but of e&s;teem
and re&s;pect, &s;eek her of her friends, he thought him|&s;elf
not even entitled to refu&s;e him. He told him,
however, that he could conclude upon nothing in a
matter of &s;uch equal intere&s;t to him&s;elf and his wife,
without her knowledge and concurrence; and that
during the time he demanded before he gave a final
an&s;wer, he required a forbearance of all intercour&s;e,
beyond that of a common acquaintance. His fir&s;t
de&s;ign was immediately to &s;end for Eugenia home;
<PB N="76" REF="77">
but the young man appeared &s;o rea&s;onable, &s;o mild,
&s;o unlike a fortune-hunter, that, con&s;titutionally in|dulgent
where he apprehended nothing criminal, he
contented him&s;elf with writing to the &s;ame effect to
Eugenia, fully &s;atisfied of her &s;crupulous punctua|lity,
when once his will was known.</P>
<P>Melmond, though thus well received, returned
back to Southampton with any air rather than that
of a bridegroom. The order, not to wait upon Eu|genia
in private, was the only part of his ta&s;k he
performed with &s;atisfaction; for though a mind really
virtuous made him wi&s;h to conquer his repugnance to
his future partner, he felt it could not be by com|paring
her with Indiana.</P>
<P>Eugenia received the letter of her father, written
in his own and her uncle's name, with tran&s;port; and,
to te&s;tify her grateful obedience, re&s;olved to name the
impending tran&s;action to no one, and even to relinqui&s;h
her vi&s;its to Mrs. Berlinton, and only to &s;ee Melmond
when accident brought him before her in public.</P>
<P>But Mrs. Mittin, through words ca&s;ually dropt,
or conver&s;ations not very delicately overheard, &s;oon
gathered the particulars of her &s;ituation, which hap|pily
furni&s;hed her with a new &s;ubject for a go&s;&s;iping
vi&s;it to Mi&s;s Margland and Indiana. The fir&s;t of
the&s;e ladies received the news with unconcern, rather
plea&s;ed than otherwi&s;e, that the temptation of an
heire&s;s &s;hould be removed from any rivalry with the
charms of her fair pupil; who, by no means, how|ever,
li&s;tened to the account with equal indifference.
The &s;ight of Melmond at Southampton, with the
circum&s;tance of his being brother to the Honourable
Mrs. Berlinton, had awakened all the plea&s;ure with
which &s;he had fir&s;t met his impa&s;&s;ioned admiration;
and while &s;he haughtily expected from every public
exhibition, &startq;to bring home hearts by dozens,&endq; the
&s;ecret point &s;he had in view, was &s;hewing Melmond
that her power over others was as mighty as it had
been over him&s;elf. She had not taken the trouble to
a&s;k with what end: what was pa&s;&s;ed never afforded
<PB N="77" REF="78">
her an ob&s;ervation; what was to come never called
forth an idea. Occupied only by the pre&s;ent moment,
things gone remained upon her memory but as mat|ters
of fact, and all her expectations &s;he looked for|ward
to but as matters of cour&s;e. To lo&s;e&punc; therefore,
a conque&s;t &s;he had thought the victim of her beauty
for life, was a &s;urpri&s;e nearly incredible; to lo&s;e him
to Eugenia an affront &s;carcely &s;upportable; and &s;he
waited but an opportunity to kill him with her di&s;dain.
But Melmond, who dreaded nothing &s;o much as an
interview; availed him&s;elf of the commands of Mr.
Tyrold, in not going to the lodgings of Eugenia,
and lived ab&s;orbed in a melancholy retirement which,
books alone could a little alleviate.</P>
<P>The conclu&s;ion of the letter of Mr. Tyrold, gave
to Camilla as much pain as every other part of it
gave to Eugenia plea&s;ure: it was an earne&s;t and pa|rentally
tender prayer, that the alliance with Mel|mond,
&s;hould his worth appear &s;uch as to authori&s;e
its taking place, might prove the counterpart to the
happine&s;s &s;o &s;weetly promi&s;ed from that of her &s;i&s;ter
with Edgar.</P>
<P>While Camilla &s;ighed to con&s;ider how wide from
the certainty with which he mentioned it was &s;uch an
event, &s;he blu&s;hed that he &s;hould be thus uninformed
of her in&s;ecurity: but while a reconciliation was not
more her hope than her expectation with every ri&s;ing
&s;un, &s;he could not endure to break his repo&s;e with the
knowledge of a &s;u&s;pen&s;e &s;he thought as di&s;graceful as
it was unhappy. Yet her pre&s;ent &s;cheme to accele|rate
its termination, became difficult even of trial.</P>
<P>The obviou&s;ly &s;erious regard of Henry was a con|tinual
reproach to her; and the undi&s;gui&s;ed approba|tion
of his father was equally painful. Yet &s;he could
now only e&s;cape them by turning to &s;ome other, and
that other was nece&s;&s;arily Lord Valhur&s;t, who&s;e clo&s;e
&s;iege to her notice forced off every a&s;&s;ailant but him|&s;elf.
This the deluded Camilla thought an expedient
the mo&s;t innoxious; and gave to him &s;o much of her
time, that his &s;u&s;ceptibility of the charms of youth
<PB N="78" REF="79">
and beauty was put to a trial beyond his fortitude;
and in a very few days, notwith&s;tanding their di&s;pro|portion
in age, his embarra&s;&s;ed though large e&s;tates,
and the little or no fortune &s;he had in view, he de|termined
to marry her; for when a man of rank and
riches re&s;olves to propo&s;e him&s;elf to a woman who has
neither, he conceives his acceptance not a matter of
doubt</P>
<P>In any other &s;ociety, his admiration of Camilla
might ea&s;ily, like what he had already experienced
and forgotten for thou&s;ands of her &s;ex, have e&s;caped
&s;o grave or decided a tendency; but in Mrs. Berlin|ton
he &s;aw &s;o much of youth and beauty be&s;towed
upon a man whom he knew to be his own &s;enior in
age, that the idea of a hand&s;ome young wife was per|petually
pre&s;ent to him. He weighed, like all people
who &s;eek to entice them&s;elves to their own wi&s;hes, but
one &s;ide of the que&s;tion; and ri&s;ked, like all who &s;uc|ceed
in &s;uch &s;elf-&s;eduction, the inconvenience of finding
out the other &s;ide too late. He &s;aw the attractions
of his fair kin&s;woman; but neglected to con&s;ider of
how little avail they were to her hu&s;band; he thought
with exultation of that hu&s;band's age, and almo&s;t
childi&s;hne&s;s; but forgot to take into the &s;cales, that
they had obtained from his youthful choice only
di&s;gu&s;t and avoidance.</P>
<P>While he waited for &s;ome trinkets, which he had
ordered from town, to have ready for pre&s;enting with
his propo&s;als, Edgar only &s;ought an opportunity and
courage to take his la&s;t farewel. Whenever Camilla
was &s;o much engaged with others that it was impo&s;&s;i|ble
to approach her, he thought him&s;elf capable of
uttering an eternal adieu; but when, by any open|ing,
he &s;aw where and how he might addre&s;s her, his
feet refu&s;ed to move, his tongue became parched, and
his pleading heart &s;eemed exclaiming: O, not to|night!
yet, yet, another day, ere Camilla is parted
with for ever!</P>
<P>But &s;uddenly, &s;oon after, Camilla cea&s;ed to ap|pear.
At the rooms, at the plays, at the balls, and
<PB N="79" REF="80">
at the private a&s;&s;emblies, Edgar looked for her in
vain. Her old adulator, al&s;o, vani&s;hed from public
places, while her young admirer and his father hover|ed
about in them as u&s;ual, but &s;piritle&s;s, comfortle&s;s,
and as if in the &s;ame &s;earch as him&s;elf.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. X.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Juvenile Calculations.</HEAD>
<P>MRS. Norfield, a lady whom circum&s;tances had
brought into &s;ome intimacy with Mrs. Berlinton upon
her marriage, had endeavoured, from the fir&s;t of her
entrance into high life, to draw her into a love of
play; not with an idea of doing her any mi&s;chief,
for &s;he was no more her enemy than her friend; but
to an&s;wer her own purpo&s;es of having a Faro table
under her own direction. She was a woman of fa&s;hion,
and as &s;uch every-where received; but her fortune
was &s;mall, and her pa&s;&s;ion for gaming inordinate;
and as there was not, at this time, one Faro table at
Southampton, whither &s;he was ordered for her health,
&s;he was almo&s;t wearied into a lethargy, till her re|iterated
intreaties prevailed, at length, with Mrs.
Berlinton to hold one at her own hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The fatigue of life without view, the peril of ta|lents
without prudence, and the &s;atiety of plea&s;ure
without intermi&s;&s;ion, were already dangerou&s;ly a&s;&s;ault|ing
the early independence and premature power of
Mrs. Berlinton; and the moment of vacancy and
wearine&s;s was &s;eized by Mrs. Norfield, to pre&s;s the
e&s;&s;ay of a new mode of amu&s;ement.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton's hou&s;e opened, failed not to be
filled; and opened for a Faro table, to be filled with
a peculiar &s;et. To game has, unfortunately, always
its attractions; to game with a perfect novice is not
what will render it le&s;s alluring; and to &s;ee that no|vice
rich and beautiful is &s;till le&s;s likely to be repelling.</P>
<P><PB N="80" REF="81">
Mr. Berlinton, when he made this marriage,
&s;uppo&s;ed he had engaged for life a fair nur&s;e to
his infirmities; but when he &s;aw her fixed aver|&s;ion,
he had not &s;pirit to cope with it; and when
&s;he had always an excu&s;e for a &s;eparation, he had
not the &s;en&s;e to acquaint him&s;elf how &s;he pa&s;&s;ed
her time in his ab&s;ence. A natural imbecility of
mind was now nearly verging upon dotage, and as
he rarely quitted his room but at meal times, &s;he
made a point never to &s;ee him in any other part of
the day. Her antipathy rendered her obdurate,
though her di&s;po&s;ition was gentle, and &s;he had now
left him at Tunbridge, to meet her aunt at South|ampton,
with a knowledge he was too ill to follow
her, and a determination, upon various pretences,
to &s;tay away from him for &s;ome months. The ill
fate of &s;uch unequal alliances is almo&s;t daily exem|plified
in life; and though few young brides of old
bridegrooms fly their mates thus openly and de|cidedly,
their retainers have &s;eldom much cau&s;e to
rejoice in &s;uperior happine&s;s, &s;ince they are gene|rally
regarded but as the gaolers of their young
prey.</P>
<P>Moderation was the la&s;t prai&s;e to which Mrs.
Berlinton had any claim; what &s;he entered upon
through per&s;ecution, in an interval of mental &s;u|pinene&s;s,
&s;he was &s;oon awake to as a plea&s;ure, and
next pur&s;ued as a pa&s;&s;ion. Her beloved corre&s;|pondent
was neglected; her favourite authors were
&s;et a&s;ide; her country rambles were given up;
balls and the rooms were forgotten; and Faro
alone engro&s;&s;ed her faculties by day, and her dreams
during the &s;hort epoch &s;he re&s;erved for &s;leep at
night. She lo&s;t, as might be expected, as con&s;tantly
as &s;he played; but as money was not what &s;he na|turally
valued, &s;he di&s;dained to weigh that circum|&s;tance;
and &s;o long as &s;he had any to pay, re&s;igned
it with more grace than by others it was won.</P>
<P>That Camilla was not caught by this ruinous
fa&s;cination, was not &s;imply the effect of nece&s;&s;ity.
Had the &s;tate of her finances been as flouri&s;hing as
<PB N="81" REF="82">
it was decayed, &s;he would have been equally &s;teady
in this forbearance: her rea&s;on was fair, though
her feelings frequently cha&s;ed it from the field.
She looked on, therefore, with &s;afety, though not
wholly with indifference; &s;he had too much fancy
not to be amu&s;ed by the &s;pirit of the bu&s;ine&s;s, and
was too animated not to take part in the &s;ucce&s;&s;ive
hopes and fears of the &s;everal competitors; but
though her quick &s;en&s;ations prompted a readine&s;s,
like that of Mrs. Berlinton, to enter warmly into
all that was pre&s;ented to her, the re&s;emblance
went no further; what &s;he was once convinced was
wrong, &s;he was incapable of practi&s;ing.</P>
<P>Upon Gaming, the fir&s;t feeling and the late&s;t
reflection are commonly one; both point its
hazards to be unnece&s;&s;ary, its purpo&s;es rapacious,
and its end de&s;perate lo&s;s, or de&s;tructive gain; &s;he
not only, therefore, held back; &s;he took the
liberty, upon the privilege of their avowed friend|&s;hip,
to remon&s;trate again&s;t this dangerous pa&s;time
with Mrs. Berlinton. But that lady, though emi|nently
de&s;igned to be amiable, had now contracted
the fearful habit of giving way to every propen&s;ity;
and finding her native notions of happine&s;s were
blighted in the bud, concluded that all which now
remained for her was the indulgence of every lux|ury.
She heard with &s;weetne&s;s the expo&s;tulation
of her young friend; but &s;he pur&s;ued her own
cour&s;e.</P>
<P>In a very few days, however, while the blu&s;h of
&s;hame dyed her beautiful cheeks, &s;he inquired if
Camilla could lend her a little ready money.</P>
<P>A blu&s;h of no le&s;s unplea&s;ant feelings over&s;pread
the face of her fair gue&s;t&punc; in being compelled to
own &s;he had none to lend; but &s;he eagerly pro|mi&s;ed
to procure &s;ome from Mrs. Mitten, who had
a note in her hand to exchange for the payment of
&s;ome &s;mall debts contracted at Tunbridge. Mrs.
Berlinton, gathering from her confu&s;ion, how ill
&s;he was &s;tored, would not hear of applying to this
re&s;ource, &startq;though I hate,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;to be in|debted
<PB N="82" REF="83">
to that odious old cou&s;in, of whom I was
obliged to borrow la&s;t night.&endq;</P>
<P>Glaring imprudence in others is a le&s;&s;on even to
the mo&s;t unthinking; Camilla, when &s;he found
that Mrs. Berlinton had lo&s;t every guinea &s;he could
command, ventured to renew &s;till more forcibly
her exhortations again&s;t the Faro table; but Mrs.
Berlinton, notwith&s;tanding &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed an excel|lent
capacity, was &s;o little fortified with any prac|tical
tenets either of religion or morality, that
where &s;entiment did not take part of what was
right, &s;he had no pre&s;ervative again&s;t what was
wrong. The Faro table, therefore, was &s;till opened;
and Lord Valhur&s;t, by the &s;ums he lent, obtained
every privilege of intimacy in the family, except
that of being welcome.</P>
<P>Again&s;t this perilous mode of proceeding Camilla
was not the only warner. Mrs. Ul&s;t &s;aw with ex|treme
repugnance the mode of life her niece was
pur&s;uing, and reprimanded her with &s;evere re|proach;
but her influence was now lo&s;t; and Mrs.
Berlinton, though &s;he kindly attended her, and
&s;ought to alleviate her &s;ufferings, acted as if &s;he
were not in exi&s;tence.</P>
<P>It was now Mrs. Mittin gained the highe&s;t point
of her ambition; Mrs. Berlinton, tired of remon|&s;trances
&s;he could not controvert, and would not
ob&s;erve, was extremely relieved by finding a per|&s;on
who would &s;it with her aunt, comply with her
humours, hear her lamentations, &s;ub&s;cribe to her
opinions, and beguile her of her rigid fretfulne&s;s by
the amu&s;ement of go&s;&s;iping anecdotes.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin had begun life as the apprentice to
a &s;mall country milliner; but had rendered her&s;elf
&s;o u&s;eful to a &s;ick elderly gentlewoman, who lodged
in the hou&s;e, that &s;he left her a legacy, which, by
&s;inking into an annuity, enabled her to quit her
bu&s;ine&s;s, and &s;et up, in her own conception, for a
gentlewoman her&s;elf; though with &s;o very &s;mall
an income, that to &s;u&s;tain her new po&s;t, &s;he was
frequently reduced to far greater dependance and
<PB N="83" REF="84">
hard&s;hips than &s;he experienced in her old one.
She was good-humoured, yet laborious; gay, yet
&s;ub&s;ervient; poor, yet di&s;&s;ipated. To be u&s;eful
&s;he would &s;ubmit to any drudgery; to become
agreeable, devote her&s;elf to any flattery. To plea&s;e
was her ince&s;&s;ant de&s;ire, and her rage for popularity
included every rank and cla&s;s of &s;ociety. The
more eminent, of cour&s;e, were her fir&s;t objects, but
the &s;ame aim de&s;cended to the lowe&s;t. She would
work, read, go of errands, or cook a dinner; be a
para&s;ite, a &s;py, an attendant, a drudge; keep a
&s;ecret, or &s;pread a report; incite a quarrel, or coax
contending parties into peace; invent any expedi|ent,
and execute any &s;cheme&mdash;all with the pretext
to oblige others, but all, in fact, for &s;imple ego|ti&s;m;
as prevalent in her mind as in that of the
more highly ambitious, though meauer and le&s;s
dangerous.</P>
<P>Camilla was much relieved when &s;he found this
officious per&s;on was no longer retained &s;olely upon
her account; but &s;till &s;he could neither obtain her
bills, no an&s;wers ever arriving, nor the money for
her twenty pound note, Mrs. Mitten always evad|ing
to deliver it, and a&s;&s;erting &s;he was &s;ure &s;ome|body
would come in the &s;tage the next day for the
payment &s;he had promi&s;ed; and when Camilla
wanted ca&s;h for any of the very few articles &s;he
now allowed her&s;elf to think indi&s;pen&s;ible, in&s;tead
of re&s;toring it into her hands, &s;he flew out her&s;elf
to purcha&s;e the goods that were required, and al|ways
brought them home with a&s;&s;urances they
were cheaper than the &s;hopkeepers would let her
have them for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>Camilla re&s;i&s;ted all incitements to new dre&s;s and
new ornaments, with a fortitude which mu&s;t not
be judged by the aged, nor the retired, who weigh|ing
only the frivolity of what &s;he with&s;tood, are
not qualified to appreciate the merit of this &s;ort of
re&s;ignation; the young, the gay, the new in life,
who know that, among&s;t minor calamities, none
are more alarming to the juvenile brea&s;t than the
<PB N="84" REF="85">
fear of not appearing initiated in the reigning
modes, can alone do ju&s;tice to the pre&s;ent philo&s;o|phy
of Camilla, in &s;eeing that all &s;he wore, by the
quick changes of fa&s;hion, &s;eemed already out of
date; in refu&s;ing to look at the perpetual diver&s;ity
of apparel daily brought, by various dre&s;s model|lers,
for the approbation of Mrs. Berlinton, and in
&s;eeing that lady always newly, brightly, and in a
di&s;tingui&s;hed manner attired, yet appearing by her
&s;ide in exactly the &s;ame array that &s;he had con&s;tantly
worn at Tunbridge. Nor was Camilla indifferent
to this contra&s;t; but &s;he &s;ubmitted to it as the
duty of her pre&s;ent involved &s;ituation, which ex|acted
from her every privation, in preference to be|&s;towing
upon any new expence the only &s;um &s;he
could command towards clearing what was pa&s;t.</P>
<P>But, after a very &s;hort time, the little wardrobe
exhibited a wor&s;e quality than that of not keeping
pace with the la&s;t devi&s;es of the <HI>ton;</HI> it lo&s;t not
merely its newne&s;s, but its delicacy. Alas! thought
&s;he, how long, in the careful and rare wear of
Etherington and Cleves, all this would have &s;erved
me; while here, in this daily u&s;e, a fortnight is
&s;carce pa&s;&s;ed, yet all is &s;poilt and de&s;troyed. Ah!
public places are only for the rich!</P>
<P>Now, therefore, Mrs. Mittin was of &s;erious
utility; &s;he failed not to ob&s;erve the declining
&s;tate of her attire; and though &s;he wondered at the
par&s;imony which &s;o re&s;olutely prohibited all orders
for its renewal, in a young lady &s;he con&s;idered as
&s;o great an heire&s;s, &s;he was yet proud to di&s;play her
various powers of proving &s;erviceable. She turned,
changed, rubbed, cleaned, and new made up all
the &s;everal articles of which her dre&s;s was com|po&s;ed,
to &s;o much advantage, and with &s;uch &s;trik|ing
effect, that for yet a few days more all &s;eemed
renewed, and by the arts of &s;ome few alterations,
her appearance was rather more than le&s;s fa&s;hion|able
than upon her fir&s;t arrival.</P>
<P>But this could not la&s;t long; and when all,
again, was fading into a &s;tate of decay, Mrs. Ber|linton
<PB N="85" REF="86">
received an invitation for her&s;elf and her
fair gue&s;t, to a great ball and &s;upper, given upon
the occa&s;ion of a young nobleman's coming of age,
in which all the dancers, by agreement, were to be
habited in uniform.</P>
<P>This uniform was to be clear fine lawn, with
lilac plumes and ornaments.</P>
<P>Camilla had now, with con&s;uming regret, pa&s;&s;ed
&s;everal days without one &s;ight of Edgar. This
invitation, therefore, which was general to all the
company at Southampton, was, in its fir&s;t &s;ound,
delicious; but became, upon con&s;ideration, the re|ver&s;e.
Clear lawn and lilac plumes and ornaments
&s;he had none; how to go &s;he knew not; yet Edgar
&s;he was &s;ure would be there; how to &s;tay away &s;he
knew le&s;s.</P>
<P>This was a &s;evere moment to her courage; &s;he
felt it faultering, and putting down the card of in|vitation,
without the force of de&s;iring Mrs. Berlin|ton
to make her excu&s;e, repaired to her own room,
terrified by the preponderance of her wi&s;hes to a
con&s;ent which &s;he knew her &s;ituation rendered un|warrantable.</P>
<P>There, however, though &s;he gained time for re|flection,
&s;he gathered not the re&s;olution &s;he &s;ought.
The &s;tay at Southampton, by the de&s;ire of Lyn|mere,
had been lengthened; yet only a week now
remained, before &s;he mu&s;t return to her father and
her uncle&mdash;but how return? &s;eparated from Ed|gar?
Edgar whom &s;he &s;till believed &s;he had only
to &s;ee again in &s;ome more au&s;picious moment, to
re-conquer and &s;ix for life! But when and where
might that au&s;picious moment be looked for? not
at Mrs. Berlinton's; there he no more attempted
to vi&s;it: not at the Rooms; tho&s;e now were de|cidedly
relinqui&s;hed, and all general invitations
were inadequate to draw Mrs. Berlinton from her
new pur&s;uit: where, then, was this happy expla|nation
to pa&s;s?</P>
<P>When our wi&s;hes can only be gratified with dif|ficulty,
we conclude, in the ardour of combating
<PB N="86" REF="87">
their ob&s;tacle, that to lo&s;e them, is to lo&s;e every
thing, to obtain them is to en&s;ure all good. At
this ball, and this &s;upper, Camilla painted Edgar
completely re&s;tored to her; &s;he was certain he
would dance with her; &s;he was &s;ure he would &s;it
by no one el&s;e during the repa&s;t; the many days
&s;ince they had met would endear to him every mo|ment
they could now &s;pend together, and her active
imagination &s;oon worked up &s;cenes &s;o important
from this evening, that &s;he next per&s;uaded her be|lief
that all chance of reconciliation hung wholly
upon the meeting it offered.</P>
<P>Impelled by this notion, yet wavering, di&s;&s;ati&s;|fied,
and uncomfortable, &s;he &s;ummoned Mrs. Mit|ten,
and intreated &s;he would make &s;uch inquiries
concerning the value of the ball-dre&s;s uniform, as
would enable her to e&s;timate its entire expence.</P>
<P>Her hours pa&s;&s;ed in extreme di&s;quietude; for
while all her hopes centred in the approaching fe&s;|tival,
the e&s;timate was to determine her power of
enjoying it was by no means ea&s;y to procure.
Mrs. Mittin, though an adept in &s;uch matters,
took more plea&s;ure in the parade than in the per|formance
of her ta&s;k; and always an&s;wered to her
inquiries, that it was impo&s;&s;ible to &s;peak &s;o &s;oon;
that &s;he mu&s;t go to &s;uch another &s;hop fir&s;t; that
&s;he mu&s;t con&s;ult with &s;uch and &s;uch a per&s;on; and
that &s;he mu&s;t con&s;ider over more clo&s;ely the orders
given by Mrs. Berlinton, which were to be her di|rection,
though with the &s;tipulation of having ma|terials
much cheaper and more common.</P>
<P>At length, however, &s;he bur&s;t into her room,
one morning, before &s;he was dre&s;&s;ed, &s;aying:
&startq;Now, my dear mi&s;s, I hope I &s;hall make you
happy;&endq; and di&s;played, upon the bed, a beautiful
piece of fine lawn.</P>
<P>Camilla examined and admired it, a&s;ked what it
was a yard, and how much would &s;uffice for the
dre&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;Why, my dear, I'll an&s;wer for it there's
enough for three whole dre&s;&s;es; why it's a whole
<PB N="87" REF="88">
piece; and I dare &s;ay I can get a hankerchief and
an apron out of it into the bargain.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But I want neither handkerchief, nor apron,
nor three dre&s;&s;es, Mrs. Mittin; I &s;hall take the
&s;malle&s;t quantity that is po&s;&s;ible, if I take any
at all.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Mitten &s;aid that the man would not cut it,
and &s;he mu&s;t take the whole, or none.</P>
<P>Camilla was amazed &s;he could &s;o far have mi&s;|under&s;tood
her as to bring it upon &s;uch terms, and
begged &s;he would carry it back.</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, if you don't take this, my dear, there's
nothing in the &s;hops that comes near it for le&s;s than
fifteen &s;hillings a-yard; Mrs. Berlinton gives
eighteen for her's, and it don't look one bit to
choo&s;e; and this, if you take it all together, you
may have for ten, for all its width, for there's 30
yards, and the piece comes to but fifteen pound.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla prote&s;ted &s;he would not, at this time,
pay ten &s;hillings a-yard for any gown in the
world.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, who had flattered her&s;elf that the
handkerchief and apron, at lea&s;t, if not one of the
gowns, would have fallen to her &s;hare, was much
di&s;compo&s;ed by this unexpected declaration; and
di&s;appointed, murmuring, and conceiving her the
mo&s;t avaricious of mortals, was forced away; leav|ing
Camilla in complete de&s;pondence of any power
to effect her wi&s;h with propriety.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin came back late, and with a look of
di&s;may; the man of whom &s;he had had the mu&s;lin,
who was a traveller, whom &s;he had met at a friend's,
had not waited her return; and, as &s;he had left the
fifteen pounds with him, for a pledge of the &s;ecu|rity
of his goods, &s;he &s;uppo&s;ed he had made off, to
get rid of the whole piece at once.</P>
<P>Camilla felt petrified. No po&s;&s;ible plea&s;ure or
de&s;ire could urge her, deliberately, to what &s;he
deemed an extravagance; yet here, in one moment,
&s;he was de&s;poiled of three parts of all &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed,
<PB N="88" REF="89">
either for her own u&s;e, or towards the re&s;titution
of her ju&s;t debts with others.</P>
<P>Ob&s;erving her di&s;tre&s;s, though with more di&s;|plea&s;ure
than pity, from believing it founded in
the mo&s;t extraordinary covetou&s;ne&s;s, Mrs. Mitten
propo&s;ed mea&s;uring the piece in three, and di&s;po&s;|ing
of the two gowns &s;he did not want to Mrs.
Berlinton, or her &s;i&s;ter and Mi&s;s Lynmere.</P>
<P>Camilla was a little revived; but the re&s;pite of
difficulty was &s;hort; upon opening the piece, it was
found damaged; and after the fir&s;t few yards;
which Mrs. Mittin had &s;edulou&s;ly examined, not a
breadth had e&s;caped &s;ome rent, fray, or mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>The ill being now irremediable, to make up the
dre&s;s in the cheape&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible was the only
con&s;olation that remained. Mrs. Mittin knew a
mantua-maker who, to oblige her, would under|take
this for a very &s;mall payment; and &s;he pro|mi&s;ed
to procure every thing el&s;e that was nece&s;|&s;ary
for the mere&s;t tri&s;le.</P>
<P>Determined, however, to ri&s;k nothing more in
&s;uch hands, &s;he now po&s;itively demanded that the
re&s;idue of the note &s;hould be re&s;tored to her own
keeping. Mrs. Mittin, though much affronted,
hone&s;tly refunded the five pounds. The little ar|ticles
&s;he had occa&s;ionally brought were &s;till unpaid
for; but her pa&s;&s;ion for detaining the money was
merely with a view to give her&s;elf con&s;equence, in
boa&s;ting how and by whom &s;he was tru&s;ted, and
now and then drawing out her pur&s;e, before tho&s;e
who had le&s;s to produce; but wholly without any
de&s;ign of impo&s;ition or fraud; all &s;he could obtain
by hints and addre&s;s &s;he conceived to be fair
booty; but further &s;he went not even in thought.</P>
<P>Three days now only remained before this
event-promi&s;ing ball was to take place, and within
three after it, the Southampton expedition was to
clo&s;e. Camilla &s;carce breathed from impatience
for the important moment, which was preceded
by an invitation to all the company, to take a &s;ail
on the Southampton water on the morning of the
entertainment.</P>
</DIV2>

<HEAD>CHAP. XI.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Water Party.</HEAD>
<P>THE ball dre&s;s of Camilla was not yet ready,
when &s;he &s;et out for the amu&s;ement of the morn|ing.
Melmond, upon this occa&s;ion, was forced
into the excur&s;ion; his &s;i&s;ter repre&s;ented, &s;o pathe|tically,
the ungrateful ill-breeding of &s;eque&s;tering
him&s;elf from a company of which it mu&s;t &s;o pub|licly
be judged Eugenia would make one, with the
impo&s;&s;ibility of for ever e&s;caping the &s;ight of Indi|ana,
that he could not, in common decency, any
longer po&s;tpone the double meeting he almo&s;t
equally dreaded.</P>
<P>And this, with all that could aggravate its
mi&s;ery, from &s;eeing the two objects together, im|mediately
occurred. Sir Hugh Tyrold's coach,
containing Mi&s;s Margland, Indiana, Eugenia, and
Dr. Orkborne, was arrived ju&s;t before that of
Mrs. Berlinton; and, the morning being very fine,
they had ju&s;t alighted, to join the company a&s;&s;emb|ling
upon the beech for the expedition. Mi&s;s
Margland &s;till continued to exact the attendance of
the Doctor, though his wry looks and &s;luggi&s;h
pace always proclaimed his ill will to the ta&s;k.
But Clermont, the only proper beau for her par|ties,
was completely unattainable. He had con|connected
him&s;elf with young Halder, and his a&s;|&s;ociates,
from whom, while he received in&s;truc|tions
relative to the &s;tables and the dog-kennels, he
returned, with &s;uitable edification, le&s;&s;ons on the
$ulinary art.</P>
<P>Melmond, deeply di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, be&s;ought his &s;i&s;ter
not to alight till the la&s;t moment. She pitied him
too &s;incerely not to comply; and, in a very &s;hort
time, &s;he had her&s;elf an aggregate of almo&s;t all the
gentlemen on the beech before the coach.</P>
<P><PB N="90" REF="91">
Among the&s;e, the fir&s;t to pre&s;s forward were the
two We&s;twyns, each enraptured to again &s;ee Ca|milla;
and the mo&s;t &s;ucce&s;sful in obtaining notice was
lord Valhur&s;t, with whom Camilla &s;till thought it
prudent, however irk&s;ome, to di&s;cour&s;e, rather than
receive again the a&s;&s;iduities of Henry: but her
mind, far from them all, was hovering on the edge
of the &s;hore, where Edgar was walking.</P>
<P>Edgar, for &s;ome time pa&s;t, had joined the utmo&s;t
unea&s;ine&s;s what conduct to pur&s;ue with regard to
the friends of Camilla, to the heart-rending deci|&s;ion
of parting from her for ever. He &s;oon learnt
the new and dangerous manner in which Mrs.
Berlinton &s;pent her evenings, and the idea that
mo&s;t naturally occurred to him, was imparting it
to Mr. Tyrold. But in what way could he ad|dre&s;s
that gentlemen, without fir&s;t knowing if Ca|milla
had acquainted him with the &s;tep &s;he had
taken? He felt too &s;trongly the &s;evere blow it
would prove, not to wi&s;h &s;oftening it with every
palliation; and while the&s;e &s;till lingering feelings
awed his proceedings, his &s;ervant learnt, from
Molly Mill, that Melmond had been favourably
received at Cleves, as a &s;uitor to Eugenia. Find|ing
&s;o near an alliance likely to take place with the
brother, he gave up his plan of remon&s;trating
again&s;t the &s;i&s;ter, except in private coun&s;el to Ca|milla;
for which, and for uttering his fearful
adieu, he was now waiting but to &s;peak to her un|ob&s;erved.</P>
<P>Still, however, with pain unabating, he &s;aw the
eager approach to her of Henry, with di&s;gu&s;t that
of lord Valhur&s;t, and with alarm the general herd.</P>
<P>Lord Pervil, the young nobleman who deemed
it worth while to be at the expence of &s;everal
hundred pounds, in order to let the world know
how old he was, now, with his mother, a widow
lady, and &s;ome other relations, came down in a &s;u|perb
new equipage, to the water-&s;ide. Mrs. Ber|linton
could not be &s;o &s;ingular, as not to join in
the general crowd that flocked around them with
<PB N="91" REF="92">
congratulations; and all parties in a few minutes,
were a&s;&s;embled on one &s;pot.</P>
<P>Edgar, when he had &s;poken to the group to
which the honours of the day belonged, made up
to Camilla, gravely enquired after her health; and
then placed him&s;elf as near to her as he was able,
in the hope of conferring with her when the com|pany
began to move.</P>
<P>Her &s;pirits now ro&s;e, and her pro&s;pects re|opened
to their wi&s;hed termination. All her re|gret
was for Henry, who &s;aw her pre&s;ent avoid|ance,
and bemoaned her long ab&s;ence, with a &s;ad|ne&s;s
that reproached and afflicted her.</P>
<P>A very fine yacht, and three large plea&s;ure-boats,
were in readine&s;s for this company, &s;ur|rounded
by various other ve&s;&s;els of all &s;orts and
conditions, which were filled with mi&s;cellaneous
parties, who meant to partake the &s;ame gales for
their own diver&s;ion or curio&s;ity. The invited &s;et
was now &s;ummoned to the water, lord Pervil and
his relations leading the way by a &s;mall boat to the
yacht, to which Mrs. Berlinton and the Cleves
party were particularly &s;elected gue&s;ts.</P>
<P>Camilla, depending upon the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of Edgar,
in pa&s;&s;ing through the boat to the yacht, &s;o obvi|ou&s;ly
turned from Henry, that he lo&s;t all courage
for per&s;evering in addre&s;&s;ing her, and was even,
though mo&s;t unwillingly, retiring from a vicinity
in which he &s;eemed palpably obtru&s;ive, had not
his father in&s;i&s;ted upon detaining him, whi&s;pering,
&startq;Be of good heart, Hal! the girl will come round
yet.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar kept equally near her, with a de&s;ign that
was the counterpart of her own wi&s;h, of offering
her his hand when it was her turn to enter the
boat; but they $word$ both di&s;appointed, the Peer,
not waiting that rotation, pre&s;ented her his arm
as &s;oon as lady Pervil had led the way. There
was no redre&s;s, though Camilla was as much pro|voked
as either of the young rivals.</P>
<P><PB N="92" REF="93">
Lord Valhur&s;t did not long exult in his vic|tory;
the un&s;teadine&s;s of the boat made him rather
want help for him&s;elf, than find force to be&s;tow it
upon another, and, upon mounting at the helm to
pa&s;s her on the yacht, he tottered, his foot &s;lipt,
and he mu&s;t have &s;unk between the two ve&s;&s;els, had
not a waterman caught him up, and dragged him
into the yacht, with no further misfortune than a
brui&s;ed &s;hin, wet legs and feet, and a deplorably
rueful countenance, from mingled fright and mor|tification.</P>
<P>Edgar, not wholly un&s;u&s;picious &s;uch an acci|dent
might happen, was darting into the boat to
&s;natch Camilla from its participation, when he
felt him&s;elf forcibly pulled back, and &s;aw, at the
&s;ame moment, Henry, who had al&s;o &s;tarted for|ward,
but whom nothing had retarded, anticipate
his purpo&s;e, and aid her into the yacht.</P>
<P>Looking round to &s;ee by what, or by whom, he
had &s;o unaccountably been &s;topt, he perceived old
Mr. We&s;twyn, his forefinger upon his no&s;e in &s;ign
of &s;ilence and &s;ecre&s;y, gra&s;ping him by the coat.</P>
<P>&startq;What is the humour of this, Sir?&endq; cried he,
indignantly.</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;twyn, &s;till making his token for di&s;cre|tion,
and bending forward to &s;peak in his ear, &s;aid,
&startq;Do, there's a good &s;oul, let my boy help that
young lady. Hal will be much obliged to you, I
can tell you: and he's a very good lad.&endq;</P>
<P>The nature of Edgar was too candid to &s;uffer
his wrath to re&s;i&s;t a reque&s;t &s;o &s;imple in &s;incerity;
but deeply he &s;ighed to find, by its implication,
that the pa&s;&s;ion of Henry was thus &s;till fed with
hopes.</P>
<P>The pa&s;&s;ing of other ladies, with their e&s;quires,
prevented him, who had no lady he wi&s;hed to con|duct,
from making his way yet into the yacht; and
the hone&s;t old gentleman, detained by the &s;ame
rea&s;on, entered promptly into the hi&s;tory of the
pre&s;ent &s;ituation of his &s;on with regard to Camilla;
relating, frankly, that he thought her the &s;weete&s;t
<PB N="93" REF="94">
girl in the world, except that &s;he did not know her
own mind; for &s;he had been &s;o plea&s;ed with his
&s;on fir&s;t of all, that he really thought he &s;hould
oblige her by making it a match: &startq;which I could
not,&endq; added he, &startq;have the heart to refu&s;e to a
girl that gave the boy &s;uch a good character.
You'd be &s;urpri&s;ed to know how &s;he took to him!
you may be proud, &s;ays &s;he to me, you may be
proud of your &s;on! which is what I &s;hall never
forget; for though I loved Hal ju&s;t the &s;ame before,
I never could tell but what it was only becau&s;e he
was my own. And I'm &s;o afraid of behaving like
a blind old goo&s;e, that I often &s;nub Hal, when he's
no more to blame than I am my&s;elf, for fear of his
getting out of my hands, and behaving like a cer|tain
young man he has been brought up with, and
who, I a&s;&s;ure you, de&s;erves to have his ears cropt
ten times a day, for one piece of impudence or
other. I &s;hould not have been &s;orry if he'd fallen
into the water along with that old lord, whom I
don't wi&s;h much good to neither; for, between
friends, it &s;eems to me that it's he that has put her
out of conceit with my poor Hal: for all of a
&s;udden, nobody can tell why nor wherefore, &s;he
takes it into her head there's nothing el&s;e worth
li&s;tening to, but ju&s;t his old compliments. And
my poor Hal, after thinking &s;he had &s;uch a kind|ne&s;s
for him, that he had nothing to do but put on
his be&s;t coat&mdash;for I told him I'd have none of his new-fangled
modes of affronting my worthy old friend,
by going to him like a po&s;tillion, with $ cropt head,
and half a coat&mdash;after thinking he'd only to a&s;k his
con&s;ent, for he'd got mine without ever a word, all
at once, without the lea&s;t quarrel, or either I or
Hal giving her the lea&s;t offence, &s;he won't &s;o
much as let him &s;peak to her; but turns off to
that old fellow that tumbled into the water there,
and had near made her flip in after, if it had not
been for my &s;on's &s;topping her, which I &s;ha'n't
forget your kindne&s;s in letting him do; but what's
more, &s;he won't &s;peak to me neither! though all I
<PB N="94" REF="95">
want is to a&s;k her the rea&s;on of her behaviour!
which I &s;hall certainly do, if I can catch her any
five minutes away from that lord; for you'll never
believe what good friends we were, before &s;he took
&s;o to him. We three, that is, &s;he and I, and
Hal, u&s;ed to &s;peak to nobody el&s;e, &s;carce. Poor
Hal thought he'd got it all his own way. And I
can't but own I thought as much my&s;elf; for there
was no knowing &s;he'd hold her&s;elf &s;o above us,
all at once. I a&s;&s;ure you, if we don't bring her to,
it will go pretty hard with us; for I like her ju&s;t
as well as Hal does. I'd have made over to them
the be&s;t half of my income immediately.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar had never yet felt &s;uch &s;erious di&s;plea&s;ure
again&s;t Camilla, as &s;eized him upon this artle&s;s
narrative. To have trifled thus, and, as he be|lieved,
mo&s;t wantonly, with the feelings and peace
of two amiable per&s;ons, whether from the vanity
of making a new conque&s;t, or the tyranny of per|&s;ecuting
an old one, &s;hewed a love of power the
mo&s;t unju&s;tifiable, and a levity the mo&s;t unpardon|able.
And when he con&s;idered him&s;elf as exactly
in the &s;ame &s;u&s;pen&s;ive embarra&s;&s;ment, as a young
man of little more than a fortnight's acquaint|ance,
he felt indignantly a&s;hamed of &s;o humiliating
a rivalry, and a &s;trong diminution of regret at his
pre&s;ent purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>Melmond, meanwhile, pre&s;&s;ed by his &s;i&s;ter, &s;e|conded
by his own &s;en&s;e of propriety, had forced
him&s;elf to the Cleves' party; and, after bowing
civilly to Mi&s;s Margland, who courteou&s;ly &s;miled
upon one who &s;he imagined would become ma&s;ter
of Cleves, and mo&s;t profoundly to Indiana, who
coloured, but deigned not the &s;malle&s;t &s;alutation in
return, offered his hand to Eugenia; but with a
mind &s;o ab&s;orbed, and &s;teps &s;o uncertain, that he
was unable to afford her any a&s;&s;i&s;tance; and her
lamene&s;s and helple&s;&s;ne&s;s made her &s;o much require
it, that &s;he was in danger of falling every moment;
yet &s;he felt in paradi&s;e; &s;he thought him but en|feebled,
as &s;he was enfeebled her&s;elf, by a tender
<PB N="95" REF="96">
&s;en&s;ibility; and danger, therefore, was not merely
braved, it was dear, it was precious to her.</P>
<P>Indiana now con&s;oled her mortification, with the
&s;olace of believing a retaliation at hand, that would
overcome the otherwi&s;e indelible di&s;grace of being &s;u|per&s;eded
by Eugenia, in a conque&s;t. Full of her
own little &s;cheme, &s;he imperiou&s;ly refu&s;ed all offers of
aid, and walked on alone, till cro&s;&s;ing the boat, &s;he
gave a &s;hriek at every &s;tep, made hazardous by her
wilful rejection of a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and acted over again
the charm of terror, of which &s;he well recollected
the power upon a former occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e were &s;ounds to vibrate but too &s;urely to the
heart of Melmond; he turned involuntarily to look
at her; her beauty had all its original enchantment;
and he &s;natched away his eyes. He led on her whom
&s;till le&s;s he dur&s;t view; but another glance, thus &s;ur|pri&s;ed
from him, &s;hewed Indiana unguarded, unpro|tected;
his imagination painted her immediately in a
watery grave; and, &s;eeing Eugenia &s;afe, though not
accommodated, he ru&s;hed back to the boat, and with
trembling re&s;pect implored her to accept his aid.</P>
<P>Triumphant, now, &s;he conceived her&s;elf in her
turn, and looking at him with haughty di&s;dain, &s;aid,
&s;he cho&s;e to go alone; and when again he conjured
her not to ri&s;k her precious &s;afety, added, &startq;you
know you don't care about it; &s;o pray go to your
Mi&s;s Eugenia Tyrold.&endq;</P>
<P>Young Melmond, delicate, refined, and well bred,
was preci&s;ely among&s;t the fir&s;t to feel, that a reply
&s;uch as this mu&s;t be cla&s;&s;ed among the rever&s;e of tho&s;e
three epithets&mdash;had it come from any mouth but that
of Indiana!&mdash;but love is deaf, as well as blind, to
every defect of its cho&s;en object, during the &s;ea&s;on
of pa&s;&s;ion: from her, therefore, this an&s;wer, leaving
unob&s;erved the littlene&s;s and &s;pleen which compo&s;ed
it, retained but &s;o much of meaning as belongs to
announcing jealou&s;y, and in giving him that idea, filled
him with &s;en&s;ations that almo&s;t tore him a&s;under.</P>
<P><PB N="96" REF="97">
Urged by her pique, &s;he contrived, and with real
ri&s;k, to jump into the yacht alone; though, if &s;wayed
by any le&s;s potent motive, &s;he would &s;ooner have re|mained
in the boat the whole day. But what is the
&s;trength which may be put upon a par with inclina|tion?
and what the general courage that partial en|terprize
will not exceed?</P>
<P>Melmond, who only to &s;ome amiable cau&s;e could
attribute whatever flowed from &s;o beautiful an object,
having once &s;tarted the idea of jealou&s;y, could give
its &s;ource only to love: the impure &s;pring of envy
entered not into his &s;ugge&s;tions. What, then, was
his di&s;traction, to think him&s;elf &s;o greatly mi&s;erable!
to believe he was &s;ecretly favoured by Indiana, at the
in&s;tant of his fir&s;t devoirs to another! Duty and de|&s;ire
were equally urgent to be heard; he &s;hrunk in
utter de&s;pondence from the two objects that &s;eemed
to per&s;onify both, and retreated, to the utmo&s;t of
his power, from the &s;ight of either.</P>
<P>Mi&s;s Margland had more than echoed every &s;cream
of Indiana, though nobody had &s;eemed to hear her.
Dr. Orkborne, the only beau &s;he could compel into
her &s;ervice, was mi&s;&s;ing; her eye and voice alike
every where demanded him in vain; he neither ap|peared
to her view, nor an&s;wered her indignant calls.
&mdash;Nor, indeed, though &s;he forced his attendance, had
&s;he the mo&s;t remote hope of in&s;piriting him to any
gallantry: but &s;till he was a man, and &s;he thought it
a mark of con&s;equence to have one in her train; nor
was it by any means nothing to her to torment Dr.
Orkborne with her reproaches. To di&s;po&s;itions highly
ira&s;cible, it is frequently more gratifying to have a
&s;ubject of complaint than of acknowledgment.</P>
<P>The ladies being now all accommodated upon the
deck, &s;ailing orders were given, when an &startq;holla!
holla!&endq; making the company look round, Lynmere
de&s;ired to be admitted. All the party intended for
the yacht were already on board, and lord Pervil told
Mr. Lynmere he would find a very good place in one
of the plea&s;ure boats: but he an&s;wered he was ju&s;t
<PB N="97" REF="98">
come from them, and preferred going in the yacht.
Lord Pervil then only hoped the ladies would excu&s;e
being a little crowded. Edgar had already glided in,
and Mr. We&s;twyn had openly declared, when a&s;ked
to go to one of the boats, that he always went where
Hal went, be it where it might.</P>
<P>Clermont, now, elbowing his way into a group of
gentlemen, and addre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf to young Halder,
who was among&s;t them, &s;aid: &startq;Do you know what
they've got to eat here.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What the deuce! have you not examined the
larder? I have been looking over the three boats,
&mdash;there's nothing upon earth!&mdash;&s;o I came to &s;ee if
I could do any better here.&endq;</P>
<P>Halder vowed if there were nothing to eat, he
would &s;ooner jump over board, and &s;wim to &s;hore,
than go &s;tarving on.</P>
<P>&startq;Starving?&endq; &s;aid Mr We&s;twyn, &startq;why I &s;aw,
my&s;elf, &s;everal ba&s;kets of provi&s;ions taken into each
of the boats.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Only ham and fowls,&endq; an&s;wered Clermont con|temptuou&s;ly.</P>
<P>&startq;Only ham and fowls? why what would you
have?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O the d&mdash;l,&endq; an&s;wered he, making faces,
&startq;not that antediluvian &s;tuff! any thing's better than
ham and fowls.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Stilton chee&s;e, for in&s;tance?&endq; cried Mr. We&s;t|wyn,
with a wrathful &s;neer, that made Clermont,
who could not endure, yet, for many rea&s;ons, could
not re&s;ent it, ha&s;tily decamp from his vicinity.</P>
<P>Mr. We&s;twyn, looking after the young epicure
with an expre&s;&s;ion of angry &s;corn, now took the arm
of Edgar, who&s;e evident intere&s;t in his fir&s;t commu|nication
encouraged further confidence, and &s;aid:
&startq;That per&s;on that you &s;ee walk that way ju&s;t now,
is a fellow that I have a prodigious longing to give a
good caning to. I can't &s;ay I like him; yet he's ne|phew
and heir to the very be&s;t man in the three
<PB N="98" REF="99">
kingdoms. However, I heartily hope his uncle
will di&s;inherit him, for he's a poor fool as well as
a &s;orry fellow. I love to &s;peak my mind plainly.&endq;</P>
<P>Edgar was ill-di&s;po&s;ed to conver&s;ation, and in|tent
only upon Camilla, who was now &s;eated be|tween
Mrs. Berlinton and Eugenia, and occupied
by the fine pro&s;pects every where open to her; yet
he explained the error of Clermont's being heir,
as well as nephew, to Sir Hugh; at which the old
gentleman, almo&s;t jumping with &s;urprize and joy,
&s;aid: &startq;Why, then who's to pay all his debts at
Leip&s;ic? I can't &s;ay but what I'm glad to hear this.
I hope he'll be &s;ent to pri&s;on, with all my heart,
to teach him a little better manners. For my old
friend will never cure him; he &s;poils young people
prodigiou&s;ly. I don't believe he'd &s;o much as give
'em a hor&s;e-whipping, let 'em do what they would.
That i'n't my way. A&s;k Hal!&endq;</P>
<P>Here he &s;topt, di&s;turbed by a new &s;ight, which
di&s;placed Clermont from his thoughts.</P>
<P>Camilla, to whom the beauties of nature had
mental, as well as vi&s;ual charms, from the ble&s;|&s;ings,
as well as plea&s;ure, &s;he had from childhood
been in&s;tructed to con&s;ider as &s;urrounding them,
was &s;o enchanted with the delicious &s;cenery every
way courting her eyes, the tran&s;parent bright|ne&s;s
of the noble piece of water upon which &s;he
was &s;ailing, the richne&s;s and verdure of its banks,
the &s;till and gently gliding motion of the ve&s;&s;el,
the clearne&s;s of the heavens, and the &s;erenity of
the air, that all her cares, for a while, would have
been lo&s;t in admiring contemplation, had &s;he not
painfully &s;een the eternal watching of Henry for
her notice, and gathered from the expre&s;&s;ion of his
eyes, his intended expo&s;tulation. The &s;elf-reproach
with which &s;he felt how ill &s;he could make her de|fence,
joined to a &s;incere and generous wi&s;h to &s;pare
him the humiliation of a rejection, made her &s;eek
&s;o to engage her&s;elf, as to prevent the po&s;&s;ibility of
his uttering two &s;entences following. But as this
was difficult with Eugenia, who was lo&s;t in &s;ilent
<PB N="99" REF="100">
meditation upon her own happine&s;s, or Mrs. Ber|linton,
who was occupied in examining the beauty
&s;o fatal to the repo&s;e of her brother, &s;he had found
&s;uch trouble in eluding him, that, when &s;he &s;aw
lord Valhur&s;t advance from the cabin, where he
had been drying and refre&s;hing him&s;elf, &s;he wel|comed
him as a re&s;ource, and, taking advantage of
the civility &s;he owed him for what he had &s;uffered
in e&s;quiring her, gave him her &s;ole attention; al|ways
per&s;uaded his admiration was but a &s;ort of
old fa&s;hioned politene&s;s, equally without de&s;ign in
it&s;elf, or &s;ubject for comment in others.</P>
<P>But what is &s;o hard to judge as the human heart&punc;
The faire&s;t ob&s;ervers mi&s;con&s;true all motives to
action, where any received prepo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion has found
an hypothe&s;is. To Edgar this conduct appeared the
mo&s;t degrading fondne&s;s for adulation, and to Mr.
We&s;twyn a tyrannical caprice, meant to mortify
his &s;on. &startq;I hope you &s;aw that! I hope you &s;aw
that!&endq; cried he, &startq;for now I don't care a pin
for her any longer! and if Hal is &s;uch a mere
fool as ever to think of her any more, I'll never
&s;ee his face again as long as I live. After looking
a&s;kew at the poor boy all this time, to turn about
and make way for that na&s;ty old fellow; as who
&s;hould &s;ay, I'll &s;peak to nothing but a lord! is
what I &s;hall never forgive, and I wi&s;h I had never
&s;een the girl, nor Hal neither. I can't &s;ay I like
&s;uch ways. I can't abide 'em.&endq;</P>
<P>A &s;igh that then e&s;caped Edgar, would have told
a more di&s;cerning per&s;on, that he came in for his
ample &s;hare in the &s;ame wi&s;h.</P>
<P>&startq;And, after all,&endq; continued he, &startq;being a lord
is no &s;uch great feat that ever I could learn. Hal
might be a lord too, if he could get a title. There
is nothing required for it but what any man may
have; nobody a&s;ks after what he can do, or what
he can &s;ay. If he's got a good head, it's well;
and if he has not, it's all one. And that's what
you can't &s;ay of &s;uch a likely young fellow as my
&s;on. You may &s;ee twenty for one that's as well
<PB N="100" REF="101">
looking. Indeed, to my mind, I don't know that
ever I &s;aw a prettier $ad in my life. So &s;he might
do wor&s;e, I promi&s;e her, though &s;he has u&s;ed my
&s;on &s;o &s;habbily. I don't like her the better for it,
I a&s;&s;ure her; and &s;o you may tell her, if you plea&s;e.
I'm no great friend to not &s;peaking my mind.&endq;</P>
<P>The fear of being too late for the evening's ar|rangements,
made lord Pervil, after two hours &s;ail,
give orders for veering about: the ladies were ad|vi&s;ed
to go into the cabin during this evolution,
and Camilla was among&s;t tho&s;e who mo&s;t readily
complied, for the novelty of viewing what &s;he had
not yet &s;een. But when, with the re&s;t, &s;he was
returning to the deck, lord Valhur&s;t, who had
ju&s;t de&s;cended, entreated her to &s;top one moment.</P>
<P>Not at all conjecturing his rea&s;on, &s;he knew not
how to refu&s;e, but innocently begged him to &s;peak
quick, as &s;he was in ha&s;te, not to lo&s;e any of the
beautiful land&s;capes they were pa&s;&s;ing.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah what,&endq; cried the enamoured peer, &startq;what
in the world is beautiful in any compari&s;on with
your&s;elf? To me no po&s;&s;ible object can have &s;uch
charms; and I have now no wi&s;h remaining but
never to lo&s;e &s;ight of it.</P>
<P>Amazed beyond all mea&s;ure, &s;he &s;tared at him a
moment in &s;ilence, and then, confirmed by his
looks that he was &s;erious, would have left the cabin
with precipitance; but, preventing her from pa&s;|&s;ing:
&startq;Charming Mi&s;s Tyrold!&endq; he cried, &startq;let
the confe&s;&s;ion of my flame meet your favour, and I
will in&s;tantly make my propo&s;als to your friends.&endq;</P>
<P>To Camilla this offer appeared as little delicate,
as its maker was attractive; yet &s;he thought her&s;elf
indebted for its general purport, and, as &s;oon as
her a&s;toni&s;hment allawed her, gracefully thanked
him for the honour of his good opinion, but en|treated
him to make no application to her friends,
as it would not be in her power to concur in their
con&s;ent.</P>
<P>Concluding this to be mode&s;t &s;hyne&s;s, he was
beginning a pa&s;&s;ionate prote&s;tation of the warmth
<PB N="101" REF="102">
of his regard, when the effu&s;ion was &s;topt by the
appearance of Edgar.</P>
<P>Little imagining &s;o &s;erious a &s;cene to be pa&s;&s;ing
as the few words he now gathered gave him to un|der&s;tand,
his perplexity at her not returning with
the other ladies, made him &s;ugge&s;t this to be a fa|vourable
moment to &s;eize for following her him&s;elf,
and demanding the &s;ought, though dreaded confe|rence.
But when he found that his lord&s;hip, in|&s;tead
of making, as he had &s;uppo&s;ed, his u&s;ual
fond, yet unmeaning compliments, was pompou&s;ly
offering his hand, he precipitately retired.</P>
<P>No liveline&s;s of temper had injured in Camilla
the real mode&s;ty of her character. A &s;en&s;e there|fore,
of obligation for this partiality accompanied
its &s;urpri&s;e, and was preparing her for repeating
the rejection with acknowledgements though with
firmne&s;s, when the &s;ight of Edgar brought an en|tirely
new train of feelings and ideas into her
mind. O! happy moment! thought &s;he; he mu&s;t
have heard enough of what was pa&s;&s;ed to know me,
at lea&s;t, to be di&s;intere&s;ted! he mu&s;t &s;ee, now, it
was him&s;elf, not his &s;ituation in life, I was &s;o
prompt in accepting&mdash;and if again he manife&s;ts
the &s;ame preference, I may receive it with more
frankne&s;s than ever, for he will &s;ee my whole
heart, &s;incerely, &s;ingly, inviolably his own!</P>
<P>Bewitched with this notion, &s;he e&s;caped from the
peer, and ran up to the deck, with a renovation
of animal &s;pirits, &s;o high, &s;o lively, and &s;o buoyant,
that &s;he &s;carce knew what &s;he &s;aid or did, from
the uncontrolable gaiety, which made every idea
dance to a happine&s;s new even to her happy mind.
Whoever &s;he looked at, &s;he &s;miled upon; to what|ever
was propo&s;ed, &s;he a&s;&s;ented: &s;carce could &s;he
re&s;train her voice from involuntarily &s;inging, or
her feet from in&s;tinctively dancing.</P>
<P>Edgar, compared with what he now felt, be|lieved
that hitherto he had been a &s;tranger to what
wonder meant. Is this, thought he, Camilla?
Has &s;he wilfully fa&s;cinated this old man &s;eriou&s;ly
<PB N="102" REF="103">
to win him, and has &s;he won him but to triumph
in the vanity of her conque&s;t? How is her delicacy
perverted! what is become of her &s;en&s;ibility? Is
this the artle&s;s Camilla? mode&s;t as &s;he was gay,
docile as &s;he was &s;pirited, gentle as &s;he was intelli|gent?
O how &s;poilt! how altered! how gone!</P>
<P>Camilla, little &s;u&s;picious of this con&s;truction,
thought it would be now equally wrong to &s;peak
any more with either Henry or lord Valhur&s;t, and
talked with all others indi&s;criminately, changing
her object with almo&s;t every &s;peech.</P>
<P>A moment's reflection would have told her, that
quietne&s;s, alone, in her pre&s;ent &s;ituation, could
do ju&s;tice to the purity of her intentions: but re|flection
is rarely the partner of happine&s;s in the
youthful brea&s;t; it is commonly brought by &s;or|row,
and flies at the fir&s;t dawn of returning joy.</P>
<P>Thus, while &s;he di&s;pen&s;ed to all around, with
views the mo&s;t innocent, her gay and almo&s;t wild
felicity, the very delight to which &s;he owed her
animation, of believing &s;he was evincing to Edgar
with what &s;inglene&s;s &s;he was his own, gave her the
appearance, in his judgment, of a fini&s;hed, a vain,
an all-accompli&s;hed coquette. The exaltation of
her ideas brightened her eyes into a vivacity almo&s;t
dazzling, gave an attraction to her &s;miles that was
irre&s;i&s;tible, the charm of fa&s;cination to the &s;ound of
her voice, to her air a thou&s;and namele&s;s graces,
and to her manner and expre&s;&s;ion an enchantment.</P>
<P>Powers &s;o captivating, now for the fir&s;t time
united with a &s;acility of intercour&s;e, &s;oon drew
around her all the attendant admiring beaux.</P>
<P>No animal is more gregarious than a fa&s;hionable
young man, who, whatever may be his abilities to
think, rarely decides, and &s;till le&s;s frequently acts
for him&s;elf. He may wi&s;h, he may appreciate,
internally with ju&s;tice and wi&s;dom; but he only
&s;ays, and only does, what &s;ome other man of
fa&s;hion, higher in vogue, or older in courage,
has &s;aid or has done before him.</P>
<P><PB N="103" REF="104">
The young lord Pervil, the &s;tar of the pre&s;ent day,
was now drawn into the magic circle of Camilla;
this was full &s;ufficient to bring into it every minor
luminary of his con&s;tellation; and even the re&s;|plendent
and incomparable beauty of Indiana, even
the &s;oft and melting influence of the expre&s;&s;ively
lovely Mrs. Berlinton, gave way to the &s;uperior a&s;|cendance
of that varied grace, and winning viva|city,
which &s;eemed in&s;tinctively &s;haring with the
beholders its own plea&s;ure and animation.</P>
<P>To Edgar alone this gave her not new charms:
he &s;aw in her more of beauty but le&s;s of intere&s;t;
the &s;entence dictated by Dr. Marchmont, as the
watchword to his feelings, <HI>were &s;he mine,</HI> recurred
to him ince&s;&s;antly; alas! he thought, with this
di&s;&s;ipated delight in admiration, what individual
can make her happy? to the rational &s;erenity of
dome&s;tic life, &s;he is lo&s;t!</P>
<P>Again, as he viewed the thickening group before
her, offering fre&s;h and fre&s;h incen&s;e, which her
occupied mind &s;carce perceived, though her ele|vated
&s;pirits uncon&s;ciou&s;ly encouraged, he inter|nally
exclaimed: &startq;O, if her tru&s;ting father &s;aw
her thus? her father who, with all his tender le|nity,
has not the blind indulgence of her uncle,
how would he &s;tart! how would his &s;en&s;e of &s;air
propriety be revolted!&mdash;or if her mother&mdash;her re&s;|pectable
mother beheld, thus changed, thus undig|nified,
thus open to all flattery and all flatterers,
her no longer peerle&s;s daughter&mdash;how would &s;he
blu&s;h! how would the tint of &s;hame rob her im|pre&s;&s;ive
countenance of its noble confidence!&endq;</P>
<P>The&s;e thoughts were too agitating for ob&s;ervati|on;
his eyes moi&s;tened with &s;adne&s;s in a&s;&s;ociating
to his di&s;appointment that of her revered and ex|emplary
parents, and he retreated from her &s;ight
till the moment of landing; when with &s;udden
de&s;peration, melancholy yet determined, he told
him&s;elf he would no longer be withheld from ful|filling
his purpo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="104" REF="105">
He made way, then, to the group, though with
un&s;teady &s;teps; his eye pierced through to Camilla;
&s;he caught and fixt it. He felt cold; but &s;till ad|vanced.
She &s;aw the change, but did not under|&s;tand
it. He offered her his hand before lady Per|vil
aro&s;e to lead the way, le&s;t &s;ome competitor
&s;hould &s;eize it; &s;he accepted it, rather &s;urpri&s;ed by
&s;uch &s;udden promptne&s;s, though encouraged by it
to a &s;till further dependance upon her revived and
&s;anguine expectations.</P>
<P>Yet deeper &s;unk this flattering illu&s;ion, when &s;he
found his whole frame was &s;haking, and &s;aw his
complexion every moment varying. She con|tinued,
though in a le&s;s di&s;engaged manner, her
&s;prightly di&s;cour&s;e with the group; for he uttered
not a word. Content that he had &s;ecured her
hand. he waited an opportunity le&s;s public.</P>
<P>Lady Pervil, who po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed that true politene&s;s
of a well-bred woman of rank, who knows her&s;elf
never &s;o much re&s;pected as when &s;he lays a&s;ide mere
heraldic claims to &s;uperiority, would not quit the
yacht of which &s;he did the honours, till every
other lady was conducted to the &s;hore. Edgar had
el&s;e purpo&s;ed to have detained Camilla in the ve&s;|&s;el
a moment later than her party, to hear the
very few words it was his intention to &s;peak.
Fru&s;trated of this de&s;ign, he led her away with
the re&s;t, &s;till totally &s;ilent, till her feet touched the
beech: &s;he was then, with &s;eeming carele&s;&s;ne&s;s,
withdrawing her hand, to trip off to Mrs. Berlin|ton;
but Edgar, &s;uddenly gra&s;ping it, tremulou&s;ly
&s;aid: &startq;Will it be too much pre&s;umption&mdash;in a
rejected man&mdash;to beg the honour of three minutes
conference with Mi&s;s Tyrold, before &s;he joins
her party?</P>
<P>A voice piercing from the deep could not have
cau&s;ed in Camilla a more immediate revul&s;ion of
ideas; but &s;he was &s;ilent, in her turn, and he led
her along the beech, while Mrs. Berlinton, attended
by a train of beaux, went to her carriage, where,
thus engaged, &s;he contentedly waited.</P>
<P><PB N="105" REF="106">
&startq;Do not fear,&endq; he re&s;umed, when they had
pa&s;&s;ed the crowd, &startq;do not fear to li&s;ten to me,
though, once more, I venture to obtrude upon you
&s;ome advice; let it not di&s;plea&s;e you; it is in the
&s;pirit of the pure&s;t good will; it is &s;ingly, &s;olely,
and di&s;intere&s;tedly as a friend.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla was now all emotion; pale &s;he turned,
but Edgar did not look at her; and &s;he &s;trove to
thank him in a common manner, and to appear
cool and unmoved.</P>
<P>&startq;My opinion, my fears rather, concerning
Mrs. Berlinton, as I find &s;he hopes &s;oon for a near
connexion with your family, will henceforth re|main
buried in my own brea&s;t: yet, &s;hould you,
to any u&s;e hereafter remember them, I &s;hall re|joice:
though &s;hould nothing ever recur to remind
you of them, I &s;hall rejoice &s;till more. Nor will
I again torment you about that very underbred
woman who inhabits the &s;ame hou&s;e, and who
every where boa&s;ts an intimacy with its two ladies,
that is heard with general a&s;toni&s;hment: nor yet
upon another, and far more important topic, will
I now touch,&mdash;the pre&s;ent evening recreation at
Mrs. Berlinton's. I know you are merely a &s;pec|tatre&s;s,
and I will not alarm your friends, nor
dwell my&s;elf, upon collateral mi&s;chiefs, or event|ual
dangers, from a bu&s;ine&s;s that in three days
will end, by your re&s;toration to the mo&s;t re&s;pecta|ble
of all protections. All that, now, I mean to
enter upon, all that, now, I wi&s;h to enforce, a few
words will compri&s;e, and tho&s;e words will be my&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>He would have &s;aid <HI>my la&s;t,</HI> but his breath failed
him; he &s;topt; he wanted her to &s;eize his meaning
unpronounced; and, though it came to her as a
thunder bolt from heaven, its very horror helped
her; &s;he divined what he could not utter, by feel|ing
what &s;he could not hear.</P>
<P>&startq;Few, indeed,&endq; cried he, in broken accents,
&startq;mu&s;t be the&s;e final words! but how can I &s;et out
upon my &s;o long procra&s;tinated tour, with an idea
that you are not in perfect &s;afety, yet without at|tempting
<PB N="106" REF="107">
to point out to you your danger? And
yet,&mdash;that you &s;hould be &s;urrounded by admirers
can create no wonder;&mdash;that you &s;hould feel your
power without di&s;plea&s;ure, is equally natural;&mdash;I
&s;carcely know, therefore, what I would urge&mdash;yet
perhaps, untold, you may conceive what &s;truggles
in my brea&s;t, and do ju&s;tice to the conflict between
friend&s;hip and re&s;pect, where one prompts a free|dom,
which the other troubles to execute. I need
not, I think, &s;ay, that to offend you is nearly the
only thing that could aggravate the affliction of
this parting.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Camilla turned a&s;ide from him; but not to
weep; her &s;pirit was now re-wakened by re&s;ent|ment,
that he could thus propo&s;e a &s;eparation,
without enquiring if &s;he per&s;i&s;ted to de&s;ire it.</P>
<P>&startq;I tire you?&endq; re&s;umed he, mournfully; &startq;yet
can you be angry that a little I iinger? Farewell,
however&mdash;the grave, when it clo&s;es in upon me, can
alone end my prayers for your felicity! I commit
wholly to you my character and my conduct, with
regard to your mo&s;t honoured father, whom I be|&s;eech
and conjure you to a&s;&s;ure of my eternal gra|titude
and affection. But I am uncertain of your
wi&s;hes; I will, therefore, depart without &s;eeing
him. When I return to this country, all will be
forgotten&mdash;or remembered only&mdash;&endq; <HI>by me,</HI> he
meant to &s;ay, but he checked him&s;elf, and, with
forced compo&s;ure, went on:</P>
<P>&startq;That I travel not with any view of plea&s;ure,
you, who know what I leave&mdash;how I prize what I
lo&s;e,&mdash;and how lately I thought all I mo&s;t coveted
mine for ever, will ea&s;ily believe. But if earthly
bli&s;s is the lot of few, what right had I to expect
being &s;o &s;elected? Severe as is this moment, with
ble&s;&s;ings, not with murmurs, I quit you! ble&s;&s;ings
which my life, could it be u&s;eful to you, &s;hould
con&s;ecrate. If you were per&s;uaded our di&s;po&s;i|tions
would not a&s;&s;imulate; if mine appeared to
you too rigorous, too ungenial, your timely pre|caution
has &s;pared more mi&s;ery than it has
<PB N="107" REF="108">
inflicted. How could I have borne the light, when
it had &s;hewn me Camilla unhappy&mdash;yet Camilla
my own&mdash;?&endq;</P>
<P>His &s;truggle here grew vain, his voice faultered;
the re&s;entment of Camilla for&s;ook her; &s;he rai&s;ed
her head, and was turning to him her &s;oftened
countenance, and filling eyes, when &s;he &s;aw Mel|mond,
and a party of gentlemen, fa&s;t approaching
her from Mrs. Berlinton. Edgar &s;aw them too,
and cutting &s;hort all he meant to have added,
ki&s;&s;ed, without knowing what he did, the lace of
her cloak, and ejaculating &startq;Be Heaven your guard,
and happine&s;s your portion!&endq; left her hand to that
of Melmond, which was held out to her, and
&s;lightly bowing to the whole party, walked &s;lowly,
and frequently looking back, away: while Camilla,
nearly blinded now by tears that would no longer
be re&s;trained, kept her eyes fixedly upon the earth,
and was drawn, more dead than alive, by Mel|mond
to the coach.</P>

<P>THE &s;uddenne&s;s of this blow to Camilla, at the
moment when her expectations from Edgar were
wound up to the &s;ummit of all &s;he de&s;ired, would
have &s;tupified her into a con&s;ternation beyond even
affliction, had not the mildne&s;s of his farewell, the
kindne&s;s of his prayers, and the friend&s;hip of his
coun&s;els, joined to the genero&s;ity of leaving wholly
to her&s;elf the account of their &s;eparation, &s;ubdued
all the pride that &s;ought to &s;tifle her tenderne&s;s,
and penetrated her with an admiration which left
not one particle of cen&s;ure to dimini&s;h her regret.</P>
<P>Melmond and his &s;i&s;ter, always open to di&s;tre&s;s,
and &s;u&s;ceptible to pity, &s;aw with true concern this
<PB N="108" REF="109">
melancholy change, and concluded that Mandlebcrt
had communicated &s;ome painful intelligence.</P>
<P>She went &s;traight to her own room, with a &s;ign
of &s;upplication that Mrs Berlinton would not fol|low;
and turning quick from Mrs. Mittin, who
met her at the &s;treet door.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton yielded; but Mrs. Mittin was not
ea&s;ily rebuffed. She was loaded with lilac plumes,
ribbands, and gauzes, and Camilla &s;aw her bed
completely covered with her new ball dre&s;s.</P>
<P>This &s;ight was, at fir&s;t, an aggravation of her
agony, by appearing to her as &s;uperfluous as it was
expen&s;ive: but wherever hope could find an aper|ture
to creep in at, it was &s;ure of a welcome from
Camilla. Edgar was undoubtedly invited to the
ball; why &s;hould he not be there? he had taken
leave of her, indeed, and he certainly propo&s;ed go|ing
abroad; but could a mere meeting once more,
be &s;o repugnant as not to be endured.</P>
<P>The an&s;wer to this que&s;tion was favourable to
her wi&s;hes, for by her wi&s;hes it was framed: and
the next play of her fertile and quick reviving ima|gination,
de&s;cribed the meeting that would en&s;ue,
the accidents that would bring them into the &s;ame
&s;et, the circum&s;tances that would draw them again
into conver&s;ation, and the &s;incerity with which &s;he
would do ju&s;tice to her unalterable e&s;teem, by a&s;|&s;uring
him how injurious to it were his &s;urmi&s;es
that &s;he thought him rigorous, au&s;tere, or in any
&s;ingle in&s;tance to blame.</P>
<P>The&s;e hopes &s;omewhat appea&s;ed, though their
uncertainty could not bani&s;h her terrors, and &s;he
was able to appear at dinner tolerably compo&s;ed.</P>
<P>Another affair, immediately after, &s;uper&s;eded
them, for the pre&s;ent, by more urgent difficulties.</P>
<P>Soon after her arrival at Southampton, a poor
woman, who wa&s;hed for her, made a petition in
behalf of her brother, a petty &s;hop-keeper, who,
by various common, yet pitiable circum&s;tances of
unmerited ill &s;ucce&s;s in bu&s;ine&s;s, was unable to give
either money or &s;ecurity to the whole&s;ale dealers,
<PB N="109" REF="110">
for the renewal of his exhau&s;ted &s;tock in trade;
though the pre&s;ent full &s;ea&s;on, made it rational
to &s;uppo&s;e, that, if he had his u&s;ual commodities,
he might retrieve his credit, &s;ave him&s;elf from
bankruptcy, and his children from beggary.
The&s;e la&s;t, which were five in number, were
all, upon various pretences, brought to Camilla,
who&s;e pity they excited by the innocence with
which they &s;eemed ignorant of requiring it;
and who received them with &s;miles and encou|ragement,
however frivolous their errands, and
$requent their interruptions. But the goods
which their father wanted to lay in, to revive
his trade, demanded full thirty pounds, which,
Camilla declared, were as ab&s;olutely out of her
power to give as thirty thou&s;and, though &s;he
promi&s;ed to plead to Sir Hugh for the &s;um, upon
her return to Cleves, and was prevailed with to
grant her name to this promi&s;e for the whole&s;ale
dealers. The&s;e would tru&s;t, however, to no verbal
&s;ecurity; and Mrs. Mittin, who from collateral
rea&s;ons was completely a friend of the poor man,
offered to be bound for him her&s;elf, though
thirty pounds were nearly her year's income,
provided Camilla would &s;ign a paper, by which
&s;he would engage <HI>upon her honour,</HI> to indemnify
her of any lo&s;s &s;he might eventually &s;u&s;tain
by this agreement, as &s;oon as &s;he was of age, or
&s;hould find it in her power before that time.</P>
<P>The &s;eriou&s;ne&s;s of this clau&s;e, made Camilla
refu&s;e the re&s;pon&s;ibility, prote&s;ting &s;he &s;hould
have no added means in con&s;equence of being
of age. But Mrs. Mittin a&s;&s;ured Higden, the
poor man, as &s;he a&s;&s;ured all others, that &s;he
was heire&s;s to immen&s;e wealth, for &s;he had
it from one that had it from her own brother's
own mouth; and that though &s;he could not
find out why &s;he was &s;o &s;hy of owning it, &s;he
&s;uppo&s;ed it was only from the fear of being
impo&s;ed upon.</P>
<P><PB N="110" REF="111">
The &s;teadine&s;s of Camilla, however, could not
with&s;tand her compa&s;&s;ion, when the wa&s;herwoman
brought the poor children to beg for their father; and,
certain of her uncle's bounty, &s;he would have run a
far more palpable ri&s;k, &s;ooner than have a&s;&s;umed the
force to &s;end them weeping away.</P>
<P>The &s;tores were then delivered; and all the family
poured forth their thanks.</P>
<P>But this day, in quitting the dining parlour, &s;he was
&s;topt in the hall by Higden, who, in unfeigned ago|nies,
related that &s;ome fla&s;ks of oil, in a &s;mall hamper,
which were among&s;t the mi&s;cellaneous articles of his
ju&s;t collected &s;tores, had, by &s;ome cruel accident, been
cru&s;hed, and their contents, finding their way into all
the other packages, had &s;tained or de&s;troyed them.</P>
<P>Camilla, to who&s;e fore&s;ight misfortune never pre|&s;ented
it&s;elf, heard this with nearly equal te$$or for
her&s;elf, and &s;orrow for the poor man: yet her own
part, in a &s;econd minute, appeared that of mere in|convenience,
compared with his, which &s;eemed ruin
irretrievable; &s;he &s;ought, therefore, to comfort him;
but could afford no further help, &s;ince &s;he had pain|fully
to beg from her uncle the &s;um already &s;o u&s;e|le&s;sly
incurred. He ventured &s;till to pre&s;s, that, $word$
again he could obtain a &s;upply, every evil chance
&s;hould be guarded again&s;t; but Camilla had now
learned that accidents were po&s;&s;ible; and the fear
which ari&s;es from di&s;appointed tru&s;t, made her think
of probable mi&s;chiefs with too acute a di&s;cernment, to
deem it right to run again any hazard, where, if there
were a failure, another, not her&s;elf, would be the
&s;ufferer. Yet the de&s;pair of the poor man induced her
to promi&s;e &s;he would write in his favour, though not
act in it again unauthori&s;ed,</P>
<P>With feelings or &s;till augmented di&s;comfort, from
her denial, &s;he repai$$d to her toilette; but attired
her&s;elf without &s;eeing what &s;he put on, or knowing,
but by Mrs. Mittin's de&s;criptions and boa&s;tings, that
her dre&s;s was new, of the P$rv$$ uniform, and made
preci&s;ely like that of Mrs. Berlinton. Her agitated
&s;pirits, &s;u&s;pended, not between hope and fear, but
<PB N="111" REF="112">
hope and de&s;pair, permitted no examination of its
elegance: the recollection of its expence, and the
knowledge that Edgar thought her degenerating into
coquetry, left nothing but regret for its wear.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, who never before, &s;ince her mar|riage,
had been of any party where her attractions had
not been unrivalled, had believed her&s;elf &s;uperior to
plea&s;ure from per&s;onal homage, and knew not, till &s;he
mi&s;&s;ed it, that it made any part of her amu&s;ement in
public. But the Beauty, when fir&s;t &s;he perceives a
competitor for the adulation &s;he has enjoyed exclu|&s;ively,
and the State&s;man, at the fir&s;t turn of popular
applau&s;e to an antagoni&s;t, are the two beings who,
perhaps, for the moment, require the mo&s;t &s;evere di&s;|play
of &s;elf-command, to di&s;gui&s;e, under the &s;em|blance
of good humour or indifference, the di&s;appoint|ment
they experience in them&s;elves, or the contempt
with which they are &s;eized for the changing multitude.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, though &s;he felt no re&s;entment
again&s;t Camilla for the de&s;ertion &s;he had occa&s;ioned
her, felt much &s;urprize; not to be fir&s;t was new to
her: and whoever, in any &s;tation of life, any cla&s;s of
&s;ociety, has had regular and acknowledged precedency,
mu&s;t own a &s;udden de&s;cent to be rather aukward.
Where re&s;ignation is voluntary, to give up the higher
place may denote more greatne&s;s of mind than to
retain it; but where impo&s;ed by others, few things
are le&s;s exhilarating to the principal, or impre&s;s le&s;s
re&s;pect upon the by-&s;tander.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton had never been vain; but &s;he could
not be ignorant of her beauty; and that the world's
admiration &s;hould be &s;o wondrou&s;ly $ickle, or &s;o cu|riou&s;ly
&s;hort-lived, as to make even the bloom of youth
fade before the higher ze&s;t of novelty, was an earlier
le&s;&s;on than her mind was prepared to receive. She
thought &s;he had dre&s;&s;ed her&s;elf that morning with too
much carele&s;&s;ne&s;s of what was becoming, and devoted
to this evening a greater portion of labour and &s;tudy.</P>
<P>While Camilla was impatiently waiting, Mrs.
Pollard, the wa&s;herwoman, gained admittance to her,
and bringing two intere&s;ting little children of from
<PB N="112" REF="113">
four to five years old, and an elder girl of eleven,
made them join with her&s;elf to implore their bene|factre&s;s
to &s;ave them all from de&s;truction.</P>
<P>Higden having had the imprudence, in his grief,
to make known his recent misfortune, it had reached
the ears of his landlord, who already was watchful
and &s;u$picious, from a year and half arrears of his
rent; and &s;teps were immediately preparing to &s;eize
whatever was upon the premi&s;es the next morning;
which, by bringing upon him all his other creditors,
would in$allib$y immure him in the lingering hope|le&s;&s;ne&s;s
of a pri&s;on.</P>
<P>Camilla now wavered; the debt was but eighteen
pounds; the noble large&s;&s;es of her uncle in charity,
till, of late, that he had been &s;omewhat drained by
Lionel, were nearly unlimited.&mdash;She pau&s;ed&mdash;looked
now at the pleading group, now at her expen&s;ive dre&s;s;
a&s;ked how, for her own hopes &s;he could ri&s;k &s;o much,
yet for their deliverance from ruin &s;o little; and with
a blu&s;h turning from the mirror, and to the children
with a tear, finally con&s;$nted that the landlord &s;hould
apply to her the next morning.</P>
<P>Lord Pervil had &s;ome time opened the ball before
Mrs. Berlinton's arrival; but he looked every where
for Camilla, to &s;ucceed to a young lady of quality with
whom he had danced the fir&s;t two dances.</P>
<P>He could not, however, believe he had found,
though he now &s;oon &s;aw and made up to her. The
brilliancy of her eyes was dimmed by weeping, her
vivacity was changed into dejection, &s;ighs and looks
of ab&s;ence took place of &s;miles and &s;allies of gaiety,
and her whole character &s;eemed to have lo&s;t its &s;pring
and ela&s;ticity. She gave him her hand, to pre&s;erve
her power of giving it if claimed by Edgar, and though
he had thought of her without cea&s;ing &s;ince &s;he had
charmed him in the yacht, till he had obtained it,
not a lady appeared in the room, by the time the&s;e
two dances were over, that he would not more chear|fully
have cho&s;en for two more: her gravity every
<PB N="113" REF="114">
minute encrea&s;ed, her eye rolled, with re&s;tle&s;s anxiety,
every where, except to me$t his, and &s;o little were
her thoughts, looks, or conver&s;ation be&s;towed upon
her partner, that in&s;tead of finding the animated beauty
who had nearly captivated him on board the yacht, he
&s;eemed coupled with a fair lifele&s;s machine, whom
the mu&s;ic, per-force, put in $otion; and relinqui&s;hed
her hand with as little reluctance as &s;he withdrew it.</P>
<P>Melmond had again, by his &s;i&s;ter, been forced into
the party, though with added unwillingne&s;s, from his
new idea of Indiana. Now, however, to avoid that
fair bane was impo&s;&s;ible: Indiana was the fir&s;t object
to meet every eye, from the lu&s;tre of her beauty, and
the finene&s;s of her figure, each more than ever tran&s;|cendently
con&s;picuous, from the uniform which had
obliged every other female in the room to appear in
exactly the &s;ame attire. Yet great and unrivalled as
was the admiration which &s;he met, what came &s;imply
and naturally was in&s;ufficient $or the thir&s;t with which
&s;he now quaffed this intoxicating beverage; and to
render its draughts &s;till more delicious, &s;he made
Eugenia always hold by her arm. The contra&s;t here
to the &s;pectators was diverting as well as &s;triking,
and renewed attention to her own charms, when the
eye began to grow nearly fated with gazing. The
ingenuous Eugenia, incapable of &s;u&s;pecting &s;uch a
de&s;ign, was always the dupe to the reque&s;t, from the
opinion it was made in kindne&s;s, to, to &s;ave her from
fatigue in the eternal &s;auntering of a public place;
and, lo&s;t to all fear, in being lo&s;t to all hope, as to
her own appearance, chearfully accompanied her beau|tiful
kin&s;woman, without conjecturing that, in a com|pany
whence the illiterate and vulgar were excluded,
per&s;onal imper&s;ections could excite plea&s;antry, or be
a &s;ubject of &s;atire.</P>
<P>Camilla, who &s;till &s;aw nothing of Edgar, yet &s;till
thought it po&s;&s;ible he might come, joined them as &s;oon
as &s;he was able. Mi&s;s Margland was full of com|plaints
about Dr. Orkborne, for his affording them no
a&s;&s;i&s;tance in the yacht, and not coming home even to
dinner, nor to attend them to lord Pervil's; and Eu|genia,
<PB N="114" REF="115">
who was &s;incerely attached to the Doctor, from
the many years he had been her preceptor, was be|ginning
to expre&s;s her &s;erious unea&s;ine&s;s at his thus
&s;trangely vani&s;hing; when Clermont, with the mo&s;t
ob&s;treperous laughter, made up to them, and &s;aid:
&startq;I'll tell you a mon&s;trous good joke! the be&s;t thing
you ever heard in your life! the old Doctor's been
upon the very point of being drowned!&mdash;and he has
not had a mor&s;el to eat all day!&endq;</P>
<P>He then related that his man, having &s;een him
compo&s;edly &s;eated, and mu&s;ing, upon a pile of planks
which were &s;ea&s;oning upon the beech, with his face
turned away from the company to avoid its interrup|tions,
had enquired if he had any commands at home?
whither he was going: &startq;Not for meaning to do
them,&endq; continued Lynmere: &startq;No, no! catch Bob
at that! but only to break in upon him; for Bob's a
rare hand at a joke. He &s;ays he's ready to die with
laughing, when he &s;peaks to the old Doctor while
he's &s;tudying, becau&s;e he looks &s;o much as if he
wi&s;hed we were all hanged. However, he an&s;wered
tolerably civilly, and only de&s;ired that nobody might
go into his room till he came home from the &s;ail, for
he'd forgot to lock it. So Bob, who &s;moked how the
matter was, &s;ays: &startq;The &s;ail, Sir, what are you
going alone, then? for all the company's been gone
the&s;e two hours.&endq; So this put him in &s;uch a taking,
Bob &s;ays he never laughed &s;o much in his life. He
jumped up as if he'd been bit: &startq;Gone?&endq; &s;ays he,
&startq;why where's Mi&s;s Eugenia, I promi&s;ed Sir Hugh
not to lo&s;e &s;ight of her.&endq; So he &s;aid he'd go after her
that very moment. &startq;Call me a boat,&endq; &s;aid he: ju&s;t
as if he'd ordered a $ackney coach; for he knows
about as much of winds and tides as my little bay
Filly, that I bought of Halder ye&s;terday for fifty
pounds, but that I &s;hall make worth &s;eventy in le&s;s
than a month. Well, there was nothing to be had
but a &s;mall fi&s;hing boat, &s;o Bob winks at the man to
take in a friend; for he has all tho&s;e fellows in a
&s;tring. So in went his Latin&s;hip, and off they put.
Bob fell into &s;uch a fit of laughter, he &s;ays, I might
<PB N="115" REF="116">
have heard him a mile off. I don't think Bob has his
fellow upon earth for fun.</P>
<P>Eugenia now interrupted the narration, with a &s;eri|ous
enquiry where Dr. Orkborne was at pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Lynmere, &s;houting at what he thought the ridicule
of this concern, an&s;wered, that Bob had told the
fi&s;herman to go about his own bu&s;ine&s;s, unle&s;s the
Doctor offered to pay him hand&s;omely for taking him
on board the yacht; but thinking it would be a good
joke to know what was become of him, he had gone
him&s;elf, with Halder, and &s;ome more choice blades,
to the beech, about half an hour ago, to make Bob
&s;ee if the fi&s;hing boat was come in; and, by good
J$ck, they arrived at the very nick of time, and &s;aw
the Doctor, the fi&s;h, and the fi&s;hing-tackle, all hauled
out together. &startq;And a better &s;ight was never &s;een
before, I promi&s;e you!&endq; continued Lynmere; I
thought I &s;hould quite have bur&s;t my &s;ides with looking
at him, he was &s;o wet and &s;o cold, and &s;o mi&s;erable;
and when I thought of his having had no dinner, I
&s;houted till I was ready to roll on the beech&mdash;and he
&s;melt &s;o of the fi&s;h, that I could have hugged Bob,
'twas &s;uch mon&s;trous good &s;port. He got three half
crowns in a minute for his ingenuity. Halder be|gan;
&mdash;and two others of us gave two more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Poor Dr. Orkborne! and where is he now?&endq;
&s;aid Eugenia</P>
<P>&startq;Why we got about the fi&s;herman, and then we
had all the &s;ame fun over again: He &s;ays, that, at
fir&s;t the poor gentleman was in a great taking, fretting
and $u$ing, and looking out for the yacht, and &s;eem|ing
almo&s;t be&s;ide him&s;elf for hurry to get to it; but
after that, he takes out a little red book and a pencil,
and falls to writing, ju&s;t as hard as if he'd come into
the boat for nothing el&s;e; in&s;omuch, that when they
were ju&s;t coming along-&s;ide the yacht, he never lifted
up his head, nor li&s;tened to one word, but kept
making a motion with his hand to be let alone&punc; and
when the man &s;aid the yacht would be pa&s;&s;ed, he bid
him hold his peace, and not interrupt him &s;o, in &s;uch
a petti&s;h manner, that the man re&s;olved to take hone&s;t
<PB N="116" REF="117">
Bob's advice, and go on about his own bu&s;ine&s;s. A$d
&s;o he did, and the Doctor was as content as a lord&punc;
till he had &s;cribbled all he could &s;cratch out of his
noddle: but then came the be&s;t &s;port of all; for
when $e had nothing more to write, and looked up,
and &s;aw the boat &s;tock &s;till, and the man fi&s;hing at
his lei&s;ure, and heard the yacht had been bound home|ward
of a good hour, he was in &s;uch a perilous pa&s;|&s;ion,
the man &s;ays, that he actually thought he'd have
jumped overboard. I'll bet what you will he won't
a&s;k Bob to call him a boat again in a hurry.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;As to his behaviour,&endq; &s;aid Mi&s;s Margland, &startq;it's
the la&s;t thing in the world to &s;urprize me, after what
I have &s;een my&s;elf; nor any body el&s;e, I believe,
neither. Who is Dr. Orkborne? I doubt much if
any body ever heard his name before. I &s;hould like to
know if any body can tell who was his grand-father!&endq;</P>
<P>She then declared, if &s;he could get any &s;oul to
fetch him, he &s;hould &s;till come, if it were only that
he might not pa&s;s the evening all in his own way&punc;
which would be ju&s;t the thing to encourage him to
hide him&s;elf out of $ight, on purpo&s;e not to help them
another time.</P>
<P>Eugenia was going to beg he might not be di&s;turbed;
when Melmond, all alacrity to &s;eize any means of
ab&s;enting him&s;elf from the two cou&s;ins, who produced
in him &s;o &s;evere a conflict, offered his &s;ervices to
carry a me&s;&s;age to the Doctor; which being readily
accepted, he &s;et off.</P>
<P>Indiana and Eugenia, not wholly without &s;imilarity
of &s;en&s;ation, looked after him. Indiana had now caught
his eye; and though quickne&s;s was no part of her
character, the $ale it told had convinced her that her
power, though no longer acknowledged was not ex|tingui&s;hed;
it required neither elemental precepts,
nor &s;agacious perceptions, to make this di&s;covery, and
&s;he exultingly determined to appea&s;e her late mortifi|cation,
by reducing him to her feet. She &s;topt not
to enquire what &s;uch a &s;tep might be to Eugenia, nor
what was likely, or even de&s;irable to be its event.
Where narrow minds imagine they have received in|jury,
<PB N="117" REF="118">
they &s;eek revenge rather than redre&s;s, from an
opinion that &s;uch a conduct a&s;&s;erts their own impor|tance.</P>
<P>Still vainly, and wretchedly, the $yes of Camilla
&s;ought Edgar: the evening advanced, but he came
not; yet, catching a$ every po&s;&s;ible chance for hope,
&s;he thought &s;ome other room that they had not vi&s;ited,
might be open for company, where, finally they might
meet.</P>
<P>Dr. Orkborne accompanied Melmond back. Mi&s;s
Margland was preparing him a reproachful reception,
but was &s;o much offended by the fi&s;hy &s;mell which
he brought into the room, that &s;he had immediate re|cour&s;e
to her falts, and be&s;ought him to &s;tand out of
her way. He complied without reluctance, though
with high di&s;dain.</P>
<P>The young ladies were all dancing, Indiana had no
&s;ooner perceived Melmond, than &s;he determined to
engage his attention: the arts of coquetry require but
&s;lender parts, where the love of admiration is potent;
&s;he pretended, therefore, to feel extremely ill, put
her hand to her forehead, and telling her partner,
Mr. Halder, &s;he could not &s;tand another minute,
ha&s;tened to Mi&s;s Margland, and ca&s;t her&s;elf, as if
fainting, upon her neck.</P>
<P>This had all the &s;ucce&s;s with Melmond that his own
lively imagination could give it. He flew to a &s;ide|table
to get her a gla&s;s of water, which his trembling
hand could &s;carce hold, but which &s;he received from
him with a langui&s;hing &s;weetne&s;s, that di&s;&s;olved every
tie but of love, and he &startq;<HI>hung over her enamoured</HI><NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="foot">Milton.</NOTE>;&endq;
while Mi&s;s Margland related that &s;he could hardly
keep from fainting her&s;elf, &s;o much &s;he had been
&s;hocked and di&s;ordered by the horrid &s;mell of Dr.
Orkborne.</P>
<P>Indiana now caught the infection, and prote&s;ted
&s;he was &s;o much wor&s;e, that if &s;he had not a little air
&s;he &s;hould die. Melmond was flying to open a win|dow,
but a lady who &s;at clo&s;e to it, objected; and he
<PB N="118" REF="119">
had then recour&s;e to two folding doors, leading to a
portico open to a large garden.</P>
<P>Hither Indiana permitted her&s;elf to be led, and led
by the thrice happy, yet thrice mi&s;erable Melmond.
Mi&s;s Margland was accompanying them, but lady
Pervil, advancing to enquire what went wrong, gave
her an opportunity irre&s;i&s;tible to inveigh again&s;t Dr.
Orkborne; and as her well-bred hearer, though little
intere&s;ted in &s;uch a detail, would not interrupt it, In|diana
arrived alone in the portico with Melmond.
Halder, who had danced with her, followed, but
&s;uppo&s;ing Melmond the favoured man, walked &s;inging
off, and made the tour of the garden.</P>
<P>This &s;ituation was to Melmond as dangerous, as to
Indiana it was exulting. She now &s;uddenly withdrew
her hand, with an air of poignant di&s;dain, which the
illuminated portico and hou&s;e made amply vi&s;ible; and
when, &s;urpri&s;ed and much moved, he tremblingly
enquired if &s;he were wor&s;e, &s;he an&s;wered, &startq;Why do
you a&s;k? I am &s;ure you do not care.&endq;</P>
<P>Ea&s;ily deprived of all forbearance, &startq;Heavens!&endq;
he exclaimed, &startq;do I live, yet &s;uffer this imputation!
O divine Indiana! load me with every other reproach,
rather than this dreadful charge of in&s;en&s;ibility to all
that is mo&s;t lovely, mo&s;t perfect upon earth!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I thought,&endq; &s;aid Indiana, again &s;oftening her fine
eyes, &startq;you had quite forgot me, and all the vows
you made to me.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Wretch that I am,&endq; cried Melmond, nearly di&s;|tracted
by this charge, and by the regret at lo&s;ing
him, which &s;eemed its purpo&s;e, &startq;condemned to
every &s;pecies of woe! O fair, angelic Indiana! in a
cottage with you would I have dwelt, more delight|edly,
and more proudly, than any potentate in the
mo&s;t gorgeous palace: but, alas! from you&mdash;formed to
enchant all mankind, and add grace to every dignity&mdash;
from you could I dare a&s;k &s;uch a &s;acrifice?</P>
<P>Indiana now li&s;tened with an attentive &s;oftne&s;s no
longer factitious; though all her views wa$ted her to
&s;plendour and high life, her ear could not with&s;tand
the romantic &s;ound of love and a cottage; and though
<PB N="119" REF="120">
no character was ever le&s;s formed to know and ta&s;te the
ble&s;&s;ings &s;uch a &s;pot may be&s;tow and reciprocate, &s;he
imagined &s;he might there be happy, for &s;he con&s;idered
&s;uch a habitation but as a bower of eglantine and ro&s;es,
in which &s;he might repo&s;e and be adored all day long.
Melmond &s;aw but too quickly the relenting ca&s;t of her
countenance; and extacy and de&s;pair combated which
&s;hould bear &s;way in his brea&s;t. &startq;Ah, madam,&endq; he
cried, &startq;mo&s;t ado$$$ble and mo&s;t adored of women!
you know my terrible &s;ituation, but you know not the
&s;ufferings, nor the con&s;tancy of my heart!&mdash;the per|&s;ecution
of friends, the pre&s;&s;ure of di&s;tre&s;s, the hope|le&s;&s;ne&s;s
of my idolized Indiana&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>A deep &s;igh interrupted him&mdash;it came not from
Indiana&mdash;&s;tartled, he looked round&mdash;and beheld Eu|genia,
leaning again&s;t the door by which &s;he &s;eemed
to have intended entering, pale, petrified, agha&s;t.</P>
<P>Shame now tied his tongue, and tingled, with
quick reproach, through his whole frame. He looked
at Indiana with de&s;pair, at Eugenia with remor&s;e;
injured rectitude and blu&s;hing honour urged him to the
&s;wi&s;te&s;t termination of &s;o every way terrible a &s;cene,
and bowing low to Eugenia, &startq;I dur&s;t not, madam,&endq;
he cried, &startq;ever hope for your pardon! yet I rather
deluded my&s;elf than deceived you when I ventured to
&s;olicit your acceptance. Alas! I am a bankrupt both
in fortune and in heart, and can only pray you will
ha&s;ten to forget&mdash;that you may forbear to execrate
me!&endq;</P>
<P>He then di&s;appeared, finding a way out by the gar|den,
to avoid re-entering the ball-room.</P>
<P>Eugenia, who, in this &s;peech, comprehended an
eternal adieu, &s;unk upon the &s;eat of the portico, cold,
&s;hivering, almo&s;t lifele&s;s. Little prepared for &s;uch an
event, &s;he had followed Indiana the moment &s;he was
di&s;engaged from the dance, not &s;u&s;picious of any
<HI>t&eacute;te-$&igrave;-t&ecirc;te,</HI> from believing Halder of the party. The
energy of Melmond made her approach unheard; and
the words &s;he unavoidably caught, nearly turned her
to marble.</P>
<P><PB N="120" REF="121">
Indiana was &s;orry for her di&s;tre&s;s, yet felt a triump$
in its cau&s;e; and wondered how &s;o plain a little crea|ture
could take it into her head to think of marrying.</P>
<P>Camilla now joined them, affrighted at the evident
angui&s;h of Eugenia, who, leaning upon her affection|ate
bo&s;om, had the relief excited by pity, of bur&s;ting
into tears, while de&s;pondingly &s;he uttered: &startq;All is
over, my &s;i&s;ter, and over for life with Eugenia!
Melmond flies and dete&s;ts me! I am odious in his
fight! I am horror to his thoughts!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla wept over her in &s;ilent, but heart breaking
&s;ympathy. Indiana returned to the dance: but the
two &s;uffering &s;i&s;ters remained in the portico till &s;um|moned
to depart. They were in&s;en&s;ible to the night
air, from the fever of their minds. They &s;poke no
more; they felt the in&s;ufficiency of words to expre&s;s
their grie&s;s, and their mutual compa&s;&s;ion was all that
&s;oftened their mutual &s;orrows.</P>

<P>LOST to all happine&s;s, and for the fir&s;t time in her
life, dive&s;ted of hope, Camilla at a late hour returned
to Mrs. Berlinton's And here, her heart-breaking
di&s;appointment received the cruel aggravation of the
mo&s;t &s;evere &s;elf-reproach, when in facing the mirror
to depo&s;it her ornaments upon the toilette table, &s;he
con&s;idered the expen&s;ive elegance of her whole dre&s;s,
now, even in her own e&s;timation, by its abortive pur|po&s;e,
rendered glaringly extravagant. Since her pro|ject
had failed &s;he &s;aw the impropriety of having ri&s;ked
&s;o much in its attempt; and a train of ju&s;t reflections
en&s;ued, to which her under&s;tanding was always equal,
though her gaiety was &s;eldom di&s;po&s;ed. &startq;Would
Edgar,&endq; thought &s;he, &startq;wait the event of a meeting
at a ball to decide his conduct? Had he not every
<PB N="121" REF="122">
title to claim a conference with me, if he had the
&s;malle&s;t inclination? Rejected as he calls him&s;elf, I
had not pretended to demand our &s;eparation from any
doubts, any di&s;plea&s;ure of my own. From the mo|ment
he &s;uffered me to quit, without reclamation, the
roof under which I had propo&s;ed our parring. I ought
to have &s;een it was but his own de&s;ire, perhaps de&s;ign,
I was executing. And all the reluctance he &s;eemed
to $eel, which &s;o weakly I attributed to regard, was
but the expiring &s;en&s;ibility of the la&s;t moment of inter|cour&s;e.
Not with murmurs, he &s;ays, he will quit
me&mdash;nor with murmurs will I now re&s;ign him!&mdash;with
ble&s;&s;ings, he &s;ays, he leaves me&mdash;O Edgar! maye&s;t
thou too be ble&s;t! The erring and unequal Camilla
de&s;erved thee not!&endq;</P>
<P>A more minute examination of her attire was not
calculated to improve her &s;erenity. Her robe was
every where edged with the fine&s;t Valencienne $ace;
her lilac &s;hoes, &s;a&s;h, and gloves, were richly &s;pan|gled
with &s;ilver, and fini&s;hed with a &s;ilver fringe; her
ear-rings and necklace were of $lac and gold beads;
her fan and &s;hoe ro&s;es were brilliant with lilac foil,
and he$ bouquet of artificial lilac flowers, and her
plumes of lilac feathers, were here and there tipt
with the mo&s;t tiny tran&s;parent white beads, to give
them the effect of being glittering with the dew.</P>
<P>Of the co&s;t of all this &s;he was no judge, but, cer|tain
its amount mu&s;t be high, a warm di&s;plea&s;ure aro&s;e
again&s;t the incorrigible Mrs. Mittin, who had not
only taken the pattern, but the value of Mrs. Berlin|ton's
dre&s;s for her guide: and a yet greater di&s;&s;atis|faction
en&s;ued with her&s;elf, for tru&s;ting the &s;malle&s;t
commi&s;&s;ion to &s;o vain and ungovernable an agent.
She could only hope to hoard the payment from the
whole of her next year's allowance, by living in &s;o
&s;orbearing and retired a manner, as to require nothing
for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>The new, but all powerful g$e&s;t which now a&s;&s;ail|ed
her, unhappine&s;s, had &s;till kept here yes from clo&s;ing,
when &s;he was called up to Mr. Tennet, the landlord
of Higden. Her fuller knowledge of her own hope|le&s;s
<PB N="122" REF="123">
debts, could not make her faithle&s;s to her engage|ment;
for her acquaintance with mi&s;ery awakened
but more pity for the mi&s;ery of others. She admitted
him, therefore, without demur; and found he was
a land $$$$eyor, who had often been employed by Sir
Hugh at Cleves. He accepted her verbal promi&s;e to
be an&s;werable for the rent now due, declining her
note of hand, which her minority made illegal, and
engaging not to hurry her for the money; well &s;atisfi|ed,
by the Tyrold character in the whole county, he
might abide by her word of honour, &s;ounded upon
the known munificence of her uncle.</P>
<P>This delay was a relief, as it &s;aved a partial de|mand,
that mu&s;t have forced an abrupt confe&s;&s;ion of
her own debts, or have deceived the baronet into a
belief the had nothing to &s;olicit.</P>
<P>When this bu&s;ine&s;s was tran&s;acted, &s;he ha&s;tened to
Eugenia, to con&s;ole who&s;e &s;ufferings was all that
could mitigate her own.</P>
<P>One of the maids then came to &s;ay &s;he had forgotten
to inform her, that, &s;ome time after &s;he had &s;et out for
lord Pervil's, a &s;tranger, much muffled up, and with a
hat flapped over his face &s;o as wholly to hide it, had
enquired for her, and &s;eemed much di&s;turbed when he
heard &s;he was at the ball, but &s;aid he would call again
the next day at noon.</P>
<P>No conjecture occurred to Camilla but that this
mu&s;t be Edgar; it was contrary to all probability;
but no other image could find way to her mind. She
ha&s;tened, inexpre&s;&s;ibly perturbed, to her &s;i&s;ter, deter|mining
to be at home before twelve o'clock, and
fa&s;hioning to her&s;elf all the varieties &s;uch a meeting
could afford; every one of which, however they be|gan,
ended regularly with a reconciliation.</P>
<P>She found Eugenia weeping in bed. She embraced
her with the extreme&s;t tenderne&s;s: &startq;Ah my &s;i&s;ter!&endq;
&s;aid the unhappy mourner, &startq;I weep not for my
di&s;appoinment, great as it may be&mdash;and I do not
attempt de&s;cribing it!&mdash;it is but my &s;econdary &s;or|row.
I weep, Camilla, for my own infatuation! for
the folly, the blindne&s;s of which I find my&s;elf culpa|ble.
<PB N="123" REF="124">
O Camilla! is it po&s;&s;ible I could ever&mdash;for a
moment, a &s;ingle moment, &s;uppo&s;e Melmond could
willingly be mine! could &s;ee his exqui&s;ite &s;u&s;ceptibi|lity
of every thing that is mo&s;t perfect, yet per&s;uade
my&s;elf he could take, by choice, the poor Eugenia for
his wife! the mangled, deformed,&mdash;unfortunate Eu|genia!</P>
<P>Camilla, touched to the heart, wept now more than
her &s;i&s;ter. &startq;That Eugenia,&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;has but to be
known, to leave all beauty, all figure, every exterior
advantage aloof, by the nobler, the more ju&s;t &s;uperi|ority
of intrin&s;ic worth. Let our e&s;timates but be
mental, and who will not be proud to be placed in pa|rallel
with Eugenia?&endq;</P>
<P>She was then beginning her own &s;ad relation, when
an unopened letter upon the toilette table caught her
eye. It had been placed there by Molly Mill, who
thought her mi&s;tre&s;s a&s;leep. Struck by the &s;hape of
the &s;eal, Camilla ro&s;e to examine it: what was her
palpitation, then, to &s;ee the cypher E M, and, turn|ing
to the other &s;ide, to perceive the hand-writing of
Edgar!</P>
<P>She put it into her &s;i&s;ter's hand, with expectation
too big for &s;peech. Eugenia opened it, and they read
it &s;ilently together.</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><HI>To Mi&s;s</HI> EUGENIA TYROLD.

<P>'Tis yet but a &s;hort time&mdash;in every account but my
own&mdash;&s;ince I thought my&s;elf forming a legal claim to
addre&s;s Mi&s;s Eugenia Tyrold as my &s;i&s;ter. Every other
claim to that affectionate and endearing title has been
her's beyond her own memory; her's by the $$$al love
I bear her venerated parents; her's, by the tender e&s;|teem
due to the union of almo&s;t every virtue. The&s;e
fir&s;t and early ties mu&s;t remain for ever. Di&s;appoint|ment
here cannot pierce her barbarous &s;hafts, fortune
cannot wanton in rever&s;ing, nor can time di&s;&s;olve
them&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="124" REF="125">
&startq;O Edgar!&endq; exclaimed Camilla, &s;lopping the
reading, and putting her hand, as in benediction, up|on
the paper, &startq;do you deign to talk of di&s;appoint|ment?
do you conde&s;cend to intimate you are unhap|py?
Ah, my Eugenia, you &s;hall clear this dreadful

<P>Eugenia dried her tears at the thought of &s;o &s;weet

<P>Of the other&mdash;yet nearer claim, I will not &s;peak.
You have probably known longer than my&s;elf, its an|nihilation,

I write but to take with my pen the leave I dare not
tru&s;t my&s;elf to take by word of mouth; to wi&s;h to your
opening pro&s;pects all the happine&s;s that is flown from
mine, and to entreat you to an&s;wer for me to the whole

<CLOSER><SIGNED>EDGAR MANDLEBERT.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>At the kind wi&s;h upon her own opening pro&s;pects,
Eugenia wept afre&s;h; but when Camilla took the let|ter
to pre&s;s to her lips and her heart what he &s;aid of
his &s;ufferings, &s;he perceived at the doubling down, two
lines more:&mdash;</P>
<P>I am this moment leaving Southampton for the I&s;le
of Wight, whence I &s;hall &s;ail to the fir&s;t port, that the
fir&s;t ve&s;&s;el with which I may meet &s;hall be bound for.</P>
<P>&startq;No, my dear Eugenia,&endq; cried &s;he, then colour|ing,
and putting down the letter, &startq;your mediation
will be &s;pared. He acquaints us he is quitting Eng|land.
He can only mention it to avoid the per&s;ecuti|on
of an an&s;wer. Certainly none &s;hall be obtruded
upon him.&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia pleaded that &s;till a letter might overtake
him at the I$e of Wight, and all mi&s;under&s;tanding
might be rectified. &startq;And then, my &s;i&s;ter, all may be
well, and your happine&s;s renewed.&mdash;It is not &s;lown from
you&mdash;like that of Eugenia&mdash;from any radical cau&s;e.
<PB N="125" REF="126">
Her's is not only gone, pa&s;t all re&s;ource, but has left
behind it di&s;grace with &s;orrow, deri&s;ion with di&s;ap|pointment!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla &s;trove to &s;oothe her, but would no longer
li&s;ten to any mediation; &s;he re&s;olved, at once, to write
of the &s;eparation to her father, and be&s;eech him to
&s;end for her to Eitherington, and never again &s;uffer
her to quit that ro$$, where alone her peace was with|out
di&s;turbance, her conduct without reproach. Even
her debts, now, &s;he felt equal to avowing, for as, far
from contracting new ones, &s;he meant in future to re|$ide
in complete ob&s;curity, &s;he hoped the feelings of
this moment would procure pardon for her indi&s;creti|ons,
which her own &s;edulous future oeconomy &s;hould
be inde$atigable to repair.</P>
<P>Eugenia would not &s;trive longer again&s;t a proccdure
which &s;he deemed digni&s;ied, and the departure of Ca|milla
was hurried by a me&s;&s;enger, who brought word
that the &s;trange man, with the flapped hat, was return|ed,
and entreated her, for Heaven's &s;ake, to let him
&s;p$ak with her one moment.</P>
<P>Dead, now, to the hope &s;he had entertained of this
enquirer. &s;he merely from his own urgency complied
with his call; for her curio&s;ity was gone &s;ince &s;he now
know it could not be Edgar.</P>
<P>Edgar, indeed, was actually departed. His heart
was loaded with &s;orrow, his pro&s;pect &s;eemed black
with de&s;pondence; but Camilla was lo&s;t to that per|fect
confidence, and unbounded e&s;teem, he required
to feel for his wi&s;e, and no tenderne&s;s without them,
no partial good opinion, nor general admiration, could
make him wi&s;h to lead her to the altar. &startq;No!&endq; cried
he, &startq;Dr. Marchmont; you judged me better than
my fir&s;t pa&s;&s;ion, and her untried &s;teadine&s;s enabled me
to judge my&s;elf. Mi&s;ery only could have followed
my view of her in the mixt &s;ociety in which the thou|&s;and
accidents of life might occa&s;ionally have placed
us. I can only be happy with a character as &s;imple in
the world, as in retirement; as artle&s;s at an a&s;&s;embly,
<PB N="126" REF="127">
as in a cottage. Without that heavenly &s;implicity, the
union of all el&s;e that renders life de&s;irable, were
vain! without that&mdash;all her enc$anting qualities, with
which nothing can vie, and which are entwi$ed around
my heart-&s;tring$, were ineffectual to my peace.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You are right,&endq; &s;aid the Doctor, and your time|ly
caution, and early wi&s;dom, will protect you from
the bitterne&s;s of a per&s;onal experience like mine. With
all the charms &s;he a&s;&s;embles, her character &s;eems too
un&s;table for private dome&s;tic life. When a few years
more have blunted the wild vivacity, the floating am|bition,
the changing propen&s;ities which now render
her incon&s;i&s;tent to others, and $$$uating even to her|&s;elf,
&s;he may yet become as re&s;pectable, as &s;he mu&s;t
always be amiable. B$t now,.&hellip; whoever takes
her from the circle in which &s;he is playing, will &s;ee
her lo&s;t to all gaiety, though without daring to com|plain,
from the re&s;traint of bidden duties, which make
the bidder a $yrant.</P>
<P>Edgar &s;hrunk from &s;uch a part, and immediately pre|pared
for his long projected tour.</P>
<P>He had, originally, purpo&s;ed vi&s;iting Mr. Tyrold
before he &s;et out, and conver&s;ing with him upon the
&s;tate of danger in which he thought his daughter;
but his tenderne&s;s for her feelings, during his la&s;t
adi$$, had beg$iled him of this plan, l$$t it &s;hould
prove painful, injurious, or inau&s;picious to her own
views or de&s;igns in breaking to her friends their breach.
He now addre&s;&s;ed a few lines to his revered guardian,
to be delivered by Dr. Marchmont; to whom he gave
di&s;cretionary powers, if any explanation &s;hould be de|manded;
though clogged with an earne&s;t clau&s;e, that
he would neither advance, nor confe&s;s any thing that
could $urt Camilla, even a moment, unle&s;s to avert
from her &s;ome danger, or &s;ub&s;tantiate &s;ome good.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont determined to accompany him to
the I&s;le of Wight, whither he re&s;olved to go, and wait
for his baggage; and undertook the &s;uperintendance
of his e&s;tate and affairs in his ab&s;ence.</P>
<P>When they were &s;ummoned to the little ve&s;&s;el,
Edgar changed colour, his heart beat quick, and he
<PB N="127" REF="128">
$ighed rather than breathed. He h$ld his hand upon
his eyes and forehead for a few minutes, in ag$ny in|expre&s;&s;ible,
then &s;ilently gave his &s;ervant the letter he
had written for Eugenia, took the Doctor by the a$$,
walked to the beech, and got aboard; his head $word$
turned wholly towards the town, his eyes looking above
it, as if &s;eeking to fix the habitation of Camilla. Dr.
Marchm$nt &s;ought to draw his attention another way,
but it was rivetted to the &s;pot they were quitting.</P>
<P>&startq;I feel truly your unhappine&s;s, my dear Mandle|b$rt,&endq;
&s;aid he, &startq;that this young creature, with de|fects
of &s;o cruel a tendency, mingles qualities of &s;o
endearing a nature. Judge, however, the predomi|nance
of what is fa$lty, &s;ince parents &s;o exemplary
have not been able to make the &s;cales weigh down on
the &s;ide of $ight. Alas! Mr. Tyrold has him&s;elf erred,
in committing, at &s;o early a period, her conduct into
her own reins. The very virtues, in the fir&s;t youth,
are &s;o little regulated by reflection, were they not watch|ed
nor aided, they run into extremes nearly as perni|cious,
though not &s;o unamiable as the vices. What
in&s;tance more than this now before us can &s;hew the
futility of education, and the precariou&s;ne&s;s of i$$ate
worth, when the contaminating world is allowed to
&s;eize its inexperienced prey, before the character is
fixed as well as formed?&endq;</P>
<P>A deeply a&s;&s;enting &s;igh broke from the bo&s;om of
Edgar, who&s;e &s;trained eyes held their purpo&s;e, till
neither beach, nor town, nor even a &s;pire of South|ampton,
were di&s;cernible. Again, then, for a mo|ment,
he covered them with his hand, and exclaimed:
&startq;Farewell! Camilla, farewell!&endq;</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XIV.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A mode&s;t Reque&s;t.</HEAD>
<P>QUICK, though without a wi&s;h of &s;peed, was
the return home of Camilla; &s;he felt at this moment
<PB N="128" REF="129">
in that cru&s;hed and de&s;olate &s;tate, where the &s;udden
extinction of hope leaves the mind without energy to
form even a wi&s;h. She was quick only becau&s;e too
nervous to be &s;low, and hurried on, &s;o little knowing
why, that when &s;he came to Mrs. Berlinton's, &s;he was
running to her own room, wholly forgetting what had
called her from Eugenia, till the &s;ervant &s;aid, &startq;this
is the man, ma'am.&endq;</P>
<P>She then &s;aw, parading up and down the hall, a
figure wrapt round in a dark blue roquelo, with
no part of his face vi&s;ible, from the flaps of his
hat.</P>
<P>At another time &s;he might have been &s;tartled: but
&s;he was now indifferent to every thing, and only en|quired
what was his bu&s;ine&s;s.</P>
<P>He made no an&s;wer but by a low bow, pointing, at
the &s;ame time to the door of one of the parlours, and
then, in a &s;upplicating manner, putting together his
hands, as if begging to &s;peak to her in private.</P>
<P>Carele&s;s, rather than courageous, &s;he was going
into an empty room with him, when the &s;ervant
whi&s;pered her to be upon her guard, as the man had
a very &s;u&s;picious look.</P>
<P>Stopping &s;hort, then, &s;he again repeated her que&s;ti|on,
adding, &startq;I can hear any thing you have to &s;ay
&s;ay where we now are.&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;tranger &s;hook his head, with a motion to|wards
the &s;ervant, that &s;eemed to demand his ab|&s;ence.</P>
<P>Alas! thought &s;he, it is &s;ome gentleman in di&s;tre&s;s,
who wants to beg and is a&s;hamed. I have nothing to
give him! I will, at lea&s;t, therefore, not in&s;i&s;t upon
his expo&s;ing him&s;elf. She then whi&s;pered the foot|man
to keep in the hall, and near the parlour, which
&s;he entered, telling the incognito$ he might fol|low.</P>
<P>But &s;he was &s;eriou&s;ly alarmed out of her apathy,
upon &s;eeing him cautiou&s;ly &s;hut the door, and &s;e|dulou&s;ly
examine the apartment.</P>
<P>She wanted not pre&s;ence of mind, when not
robbed of it by &s;ome peculiar and poignant feelings.
<PB N="129" REF="130">
She turned immediately to the bell, certain its
fir&s;t touch would bring in the footman: but,
perceiving her purpo&s;e, the &s;tranger &s;eized her by
the arm, and in a hoar&s;e low voice &s;aid: &startq;Are you
mad, Camilla? don't you know me?&endq; and the re|cognized
her brother.</P>
<P>She expo&s;tulated upon his having &s;o cau&s;ele&s;sly
terrified her, and enquired why he came &s;o di&s;|gui&s;ed.</P>
<P>He laughed heartily at her affright, and extolled
his own &s;kill in per&s;onating a &s;ubtle ru$$ian; de|claring
he liked to have a touch at all trades, in
ca&s;e of accidents.</P>
<P>&startq;And have you come hither, Lionel, only for
this fooli&s;h and very unplea&s;ant trick?</P>
<P>&startq;O no, my dear! this was only for my open|ing.
I have an hundred &s;mart freaks in my head,
any one of them worth a little trip to Southamp|ton.
Be&s;ides, I wanted to know what you were
about. How does a certain ma&s;ter Edgar Mandle$bert
do? Don't blu&s;h, child. What a little $ly
rogue you have been! hey ho? Tears?&mdash;My dear
Camilla! what's all this?&endq;</P>
<P>She entreated him to make his enquiries of
Eugenia.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, you took me in, I promi&s;e you. I fully
thought the young baronet had been the man.
And, really he's as fine a fellow as I ever &s;aw.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do not &s;peak of him, I beg! O Lionel!&mdash;i$
you knew&mdash;&endq; She was going to &s;ay, how through
your means, that affair has injured me&mdash;but &s;he
checked complaints which &s;he now regarded as
u&s;ele&s;s, and therefore degrading; and, wiping her
eyes, a&s;ked if he had yet con&s;idered the large &s;um,
for the obligation of which he had made her &s;eem
re&s;pon&s;ible to Sir Sedley, whom &s;he &s;hould not
know how ever to meet, nor con&s;equently, how
ever to vi&s;it in the county, till &s;ome payment, if
not made, were at lea&s;t arranged.</P>
<P>&startq;Pho, pho, my dear child, don't be &s;o Vellum|like;
you'll be fit for nothing, &s;oon, but to file bills
<PB N="130" REF="131">
and &s;core accounts. What's two hundred to him?
Hang him! I wi&s;h 'twere as much again&mdash;I hate
making a fu&s;s about nothing. But come, tell me
&s;omething to rai&s;e my &s;pirits&mdash;I am horribly me|lancholy.
I've &s;ome notion of making a little
&s;port here with Mi&s;s Sca$e-crow, How does &s;he go
on? Wa&s;pi&s;h as ever?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Do tell me, &s;eriou&s;ly, Lionel, what is it has
brought you hither?</P>
<P>&startq;Two things, my dear. The fir&s;t of which is
the plea&s;ure of &s;eeing you; and the &s;econd is a lit|tle
amu&s;ement I propo&s;e my&s;elf with old Dr. Hic,
Haec, Hoc. I find Clermont's had rare &s;port with
him already. It's duced unlucky I did not come
&s;ooner.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Clermont? When did you &s;ee Clermont?</P>
<P>&startq;Don't be curious, child. I never encourage
curio&s;ity. It always leads to di&s;agreeable que&s;tions.
You may tell me any thing you plea&s;e, but a&s;k no|thing.
That's my manner of dealing with little
girls. How did you like my &s;ending the Major to
you? Was not that good fudge? What do you look
&s;o grave for, my dear? You're enough to give one
the vapours.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla attempted not to rally; &s;he felt pierced
as by a poignard at the very fight of Lionel. The
debt he had made her contract with Sir Sedley, the
&s;ecrecy it exacted, the corre&s;pondence it had drawn
on, the cruel circum&s;tances it had produced, and
the heart-breaking event to which it had, ultimate|ly,
led, made his view excite &s;en&s;ations too corro|&s;ive,
and reflections too bitter, for any enjoyment
of a gaiety, which her utmo&s;t partiality could not
di&s;entangle from levity the mo&s;t unfeeling.</P>
<P>&startq;Come, come, for pity's &s;ake, be a little le&s;s
&s;tupid, I conjure you. How terribly you want a
good &s;haking! &s;hall I give you one? by the way,
you have never thanked me for &s;ending you that
&s;mart young tinker. You are horribly ungrateful
to all my tender care to provide you a good &s;pou&s;e.
What! not a &s;mile? Not one dear little dimple for
<PB N="131" REF="132">
all my rattle? Nay then, if that's the ca&s;e, let's to
bu&s;ine&s;s at once. Any thing is better than mawk|i&s;hne&s;s.
I always preferred being flogged for a
frolic, to being told I was a good boy, at the ex|pence
of &s;itting &s;till, and learning my le&s;&s;on.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And what bu&s;ine&s;s, my dear Lionel? Have you
really any?</P>
<P>&startq;O yes, always; nobody has more; only I do it
&s;o bri&s;kly, people always &s;uppo&s;e it nothing but
plea&s;ure. However, ju&s;t at this minute, I am
really in rather an ugly dilemma. You know, my
dear girl, there is a certain little rather awkward
affair of mine, which I once hinted to you.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Lionel, I hope, at lea&s;t,&endq;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;O, none of your hopes with that grave face!
Hope, with a grave face, always means fear. Now,
as I am already half &s;hoes over in the &s;lough of
de&s;pond, 'twill be horrid ungenerous to poke me
&s;till lower.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now began to tremble, and would a&s;k
no que&s;tions&mdash;Lionel, when he had &s;ilenced her,
&s;eemed at a lo&s;s how to proceed; he walked about
the room with quick jerks, opened and &s;hut the
window, &s;eated him&s;elf upon every chair, and
every table; and then, in a half pa&s;&s;ion, &s;aid: &startq;&s;o
you don't want to hear any more? and you don't
care a fig if I'm hanged or drowned?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My &s;pirits are not high, my dear Lionel; and
my head is full, and my heart is oppre&s;&s;ed: if you

I beg without trifling.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, there's nothing new; &s;o don't look fright|ened;
it's all the &s;ame old &s;tory.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You continue, then, that dark, my&s;terious
connexion? O brother!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why &s;he's &s;o pretty! &s;o mon&s;trous pretty!
be&s;ides, &s;he doats upon me. You don't half con|ceive
what a pretty fellow I am, Camilla. A &s;i&s;ter
never knows how to judge a man. All the women
like me prodigiou&s;ly.&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="132" REF="133">
&startq;Indeed, Lionel, you take an undue advantage
of my affection. I mu&s;t &s;eriou&s;ly in&s;i&s;t that you
mention this &s;ubject to me no more.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I don't intend it. I intend to fini&s;h with this
once&mdash;provided you do me one la&s;t good turn.
Will you, now? Come, don't be queer.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I will do nothing, ab&s;olutely nothing in &s;o
improper&mdash;&s;o &s;hocking a bu&s;ine&s;s. Indeed, I know
not how to forgive you for naming it again.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, then, I'll pledge you my word and ho|nour
you &s;hall never hear of it more, if you'll only
grant me this one favour.&endq;</P>
<P>Di&s;plea&s;ed at the pa&s;t, and frightened for what
might be to come, &s;he prote&s;ted &s;he would immedi|ately
leave the room, if he continued this per&s;ecu|tion:
adding &startq;how affectionately I love you, I
need not, I am &s;ure, &s;ay; but a con$idence &s;uch as
this, from a brother to a &s;i&s;ter, di&s;graces us both:
and let me penetrate, but not irritate you, if I own,
that I much doubt whether I ought not from the
beginning, to have revealed this tran&s;action at
Etherington. Do not be angry Lionel: has not
every con&s;ideration been &s;urmounted by the fear of
giving you pain?&endq;</P>
<P>Finding he &s;till would be heard, &s;he was peremp|torily
quitting the room; but when &s;he had her
hand upon the door, he effectually &s;topped her, by
&s;aying, &startq;Nay, then, if nothing will content you
but getting the whole out at once, you may make
your&s;elf ea&s;y, the bu&s;ine&s;s is at end, for&mdash;&mdash;we're
blown!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t certainly be glad if &s;uch a bu&s;ine&s;s is at
an end, Lionel; but how do you mean blown? to
whom? in what manner?</P>
<P>&startq;To every body, I'm afraid; for the hu&s;band's
upon the point of getting at it.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Hu&s;band?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O, the deuce! I did not mean to &s;ay that: how|ever,
it's out! and as it mu&s;t have been known
&s;ooner or later&endq;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P><PB N="133" REF="134">
Camilla had now an air the neare&s;t to &s;everity
&s;he had ever worn: &startq;Adieu, Lionel!&endq; &s;he cried,
&startq;I am &s;orry for you, indeed; but you mu&s;t find
another hearer for this guilty hi&s;tory.&mdash;I will li&s;|ten
to no more!&endq;</P>
<P>Lionel now detained her by force. &startq;How can
you take up the thing &s;o wrong,&endq; &s;aid he; &startq;when
I tell you it's over, isn't that enough? Be&s;ides, I
promi&s;e you I have not wanted for my puni&s;hment:
when you hear all, you'll find that.&endq;</P>
<P>Too &s;ick for &s;peech, yet too weak for re&s;i&s;tance,
&s;he was con&s;trained to return to her &s;eat, and hear
what he plea&s;ed to relate.</P>
<P>&startq;My adventure, my dear, was di&s;covered entire|ly
by the want of a little hu&s;h money. 'Tis the
very deuce and all for a man to be in love when
he is poor. If I had only had a little hu&s;h money&mdash;
yes, yes, I under&s;tand that eye! but as to tho&s;e pal|try
&s;ums I have had, from time to time, &s;ince this
affair, why they could not be expected to la&s;t for
ever: And the fir&s;t went to a hou&s;e-maid,&mdash;and
the &s;econd to the groom,&mdash;and the third.&endq;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Lionel! Lionel! is this a communication&mdash;are
the&s;e particulars for me?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, I only mention it to let you know it's all
gone fairly. Be&s;ides, as to her being a married
woman, which, I &s;ee, is what you think &s;o much
the wor&s;t of all, I a&s;&s;ure you, if you knew
her hu&s;band, you would not wonder; he de|&s;erves
every thing. Such a tire&s;ome quiz! it
was often hours before we could get rid of
him. You never knew &s;uch a blockhead. The
poor thing can't bear him$ But &s;he's fond of me
to di&s;traction. Nay, nay, don't frown &s;o! If you'll
believe me, Camilla, you'll quite &s;poil your face.
Well, the fellow that threatens to betray us,
won't keep our &s;ecret under three hundred pounds!
There's an uncon&s;cionable knave! However I
thought that better than a trial too; not that &s;he
would have broken her heart at a &s;eparation, you'll
believe; but then &hellip; there's a certain horrid thing
called damages! And then my father's particulari|ties,&mdash;and
<PB N="134" REF="135">
my mother's &s;eeing things in &s;uch
&s;trong lights&mdash;and a par&s;on's &s;on,&mdash;and all that.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>Camilla, &s;haking and pale, now entreated him to
get her a gla&s;s of water, and, for a while, at lea&s;t,
to forbear continuing this terrible &s;tory.</P>
<P>He con&s;ented to ring for the water, and then,
more briefly, went on.</P>
<P>&startq;Finding it vain to hope any longer for entire
concealment, I thought a private di&s;covery le&s;s
&s;hocking than a public one; and therefore, telling
my &s;tory as well as I could I &s;tated that three hun|dred
pounds would &s;ave both the expences and
publicity of a trial; and, with every po&s;&s;ible pro|fe&s;&s;ion
of contrition and reformation, I humbly
petitioned for that &s;um from my uncle.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My poor uncle! alas! what unrea&s;onable&mdash;unmerciful
claims every way &s;urround him!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;He's well revenged for mine, I promi&s;e you!
There's no plague lo&s;t between us, as you'll own,
when you've heard the end of my poor petiti|on.
I followed up my letter, according to my
u&s;ual cu&s;tom, the next day, in order to receive my
money, knowing poor uncle hates writing wor&s;e
than giving: well, and when I arrived, my mind
ju&s;t made up to a few gentle reprimands again&s;t
naughtine&s;s, and as many gentle promi&s;es to do &s;o
no more; out pops me the old butler, and &s;ays his
ma&s;ter can't &s;ee me! Not &s;ee me? Why, who's
with him? Your father, &s;ir! O, then for your life,
cries I, don't &s;ay I have been here&mdash;but now&mdash;now
Camilla will you think me puni&s;hed or not?&mdash;My
uncle had a little go$t in his right-hand, and had
made my father open and read&mdash;that very day,&mdash;all
his letters! If ever you knew old Nick &s;erve a
poor young fellow a wor&s;e turn than that, tell me
&s;o? I owe him &s;uch a grudge for it, I could almo&s;t
find in my heart to turn par&s;on my&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla could not utter a word. She dropt her
head over her folded arms upon the table, to hide
her offending brother from her &s;ight, whom now,
placed in oppo&s;ition to her all-excellent father, &s;he
<PB N="135" REF="136">
blamed beyond her powers, beyond what &s;he con|ceived
even her rights of expre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>&startq;Why now, my dear Camilla, what do you hide
your face for? Do you think I'm not as &s;orry for
this thing as you can be for the life of you; How|ever,
now comes the wor&s;t; and if you don't pity
me when you hear this, you may depend upon it
you have no bowels. I was making off as fa&s;t as I
could, mum the word to the &s;ervants, when in
comes old Jacob with a letter. I &s;natched it from
him, hoping my uncle had privately &s;ent me a
draft&mdash;but the direction was written by my father!
Don't you begin to feel a little for me now?&endq;</P>
<P>She could only rai&s;e her head to ejuculate, &startq;My
poor&mdash;poor father!&endq; and then, nearly in an agony,
dropt it again.</P>
<P>&startq;Hey-day, Camilla? how's this? what! not
one word of poor, poor brother, too? why you
are harder than flint. However, read that letter.
And then, if you dont think me the mo&s;t unhappy
young fellow in exi&s;tence, you are fit to devi&s;e
tortures for the inqui&s;ition.&endq;</P>
<P>She took the letter eagerly, yet awfully, ki&s;&s;ed
in weeping the hand-writing, and read what fol|lows:</P>
<Q><HI>To</HI> LIONEL TYROLD, <HI>E&s;q.</HI></Q>
<P>To have brought up my family with the purity
of principle which the holy profe&s;&s;ion of their
father ought to in&s;pire him to teach, has been,
from the hour that my paternal &s;olicitudes com|menced,
the mo&s;t fervent of my prayers. How
my hopes have been deluded you have but too long
known; how gro&s;sly they have failed has reached
my own knowledge but this moment. I here re|&s;ign
the vain expectation, that through my &s;on the
community might ble&s;s me: may a for&s;eiture &s;o
dread not extend to me, al&s;o, through my daugh|ters!&mdash;</P>
<P>Camilla &s;topt, &s;unk upon her knees, and devout|ly
repeated the la&s;t &s;entence, with her own ardent
&s;upplications joined to it, before &s;he could proceed.</P>
<P><PB N="136" REF="137">
A few words more mu&s;t, for the pre&s;ent, &s;uffice
between us. Accident, by throwing into my hands
this la&s;t letter to the uncle who&s;e goodne&s;s you have
mo&s;t unwarrantably and unfeelingly abu&s;ed, has given
birth to an inve&s;tigation, by which I have arrived at
the di&s;covery of the long cour&s;e of rapacity by which
you have pillaged from the &s;ame &s;ource. Henceforth,
you will find it dry. I have &s;tated to my brother the
mi&s;take of his compliance, and obtained his &s;olemn
word, that all intercour&s;e between you, that has not
my previous approbation, &s;hall here finally cea&s;e. You
will now, therefore, empty no more tho&s;e coffers
which, but for you, have only been opened to the
ju&s;t claims of benevolence.</P>
<P>You will regard this detection as the wrath of ill|fortune;
I view it, on the contrary, as the mercy of
Providence. What were further pecuniary ex$nerati|ons,
but deeper plunges into vilifying di$&s;olutene&s;s?
If, as you intimate, the refu&s;al of your pre&s;ent de|mands
will expo&s;e you to public &s;hame, may its &s;hock
awaken feelings that may re&s;tore you to private virtue!
I cannot &s;pare you from di&s;grace, by aiding you in
corruption; I cannot re&s;cue you from worldly di&s;ho|nour,
by hiding and abetting crimes that may unfold
to eternal mi&s;ery. To error I would be lenient; to
penitence I would be con&s;oling; to reformation I
would open my arms: but to him who confe&s;&s;es his
guilt only to &s;ave him&s;elf from puni&s;hment, to him
who would elude the incurred penalties of his wick|edne&s;s,
by &s;hamele&s;sly &s;oliciting a re&s;pectable old re|lation
to u&s;e bribery for its concealment,&mdash;to him, I
can only &s;av, Since all precepts of virtue have failed
to &s;hew thee its excellence, go! learn of misfortune
the evils, at lea&s;t of vice! Pay to the laws of &s;ociety
what retribution they require for their violation&mdash;and
if &s;uffering &s;hould lead to contrition, and &s;eclu&s;ion

<P>Camilla wept over this letter till its characters
were almo&s;t effaced by her tears. To withhold from
her father the knowledge of the mi&s;conduct of Lio|nel,
what had &s;he not &s;uffered? what not &s;acrificed?
yet to find it all unavailing, to find him thus inform|ed
of his &s;on's wanton calls for money, his culpable
connection, and his ju&s;t fears of &s;eeing it publi&s;hed
and puni&s;hed,&mdash;&mdash;and to confider with all this, that
Edgar, through the&s;e unpardonable deviations from
right, was irretrievably lo&s;t to her, excited &s;orrow
the mo&s;t depre&s;&s;ing for her father, and regrets &s;carce
&s;upportable for her&s;elf.</P>
<P>&startq;Well,&endq; cried Lionel, &startq;what do you think of
my ca&s;e now? Don't you allow I pay pretty hand|&s;omely
for a mere young man's gambol? I a&s;&s;ure you
I don't know what might have been the con&s;equence,
if Jacob had not afforded me a little comfort. He
told me you were going to be married to '&s;quire
Mandleb$$t, and that you were all at Southton, and
that he was &s;ure you would do any thing in the world
to get me out of jeopardy; and &s;o, thinking pretty
much the &s;ame my&s;elf, here I am! Well, what &s;ay
you, Camilla? Will you &s;peak a little word for me
to Edgar?&endq;</P>
<P>Shame, now taking place of affliction, &s;topt her
tears, which dried upon her burning cheeks, as &s;he
an&s;wered, &startq;He is well known to you, Lionel:&mdash;
you can addre&s;s him your&s;elf!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;No; that's your mi&s;take, my dear. I have a
little odd money matter to &s;ettle with him already;
and be&s;ides, we have had a fort of a falling out upon
the &s;ubject; for when I &s;poke to him about it la&s;t,
he gave him&s;elf the airs of an old ju&s;tice of the
<PB N="138" REF="139">
peace, and &s;aid if he did not find the affair given up,
nothing &s;hould induce him ever to help me again.
What a mere codger that lad has turned out!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, noble Edgar! ju&s;t, high-principled, and
firm!&endq; half pronounced Camilla, while again the
the icicles di&s;&s;olved, and trickled down her face.</P>
<P>&startq;See but the different way in which things &s;trike
people! however, it is not very pretty in you, Ca|milla,
to prai&s;e him for treating me &s;o &s;$urvily. But
come, do&s;t think he'll lend me the money?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lend,&endq; repeated &s;he, &s;ignificantly.</P>
<P>&startq;Ay lend; for I &s;hall pay it every farthing; and
every thing el&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And how? And when?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why,&mdash;with old unky Relvil's fortune.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;For &s;hame, brother!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Nay, nay, you know as well as I do, I mu&s;t
have it at la&s;t. Who el&s;e has he to leave it to? Come,
will you beg the three hundred for me? He dare not
refu&s;e you, you know, in your day of power.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lionel,&endq; cried &s;he, with extreme emotion, &startq;I
&s;hall &s;ee him no more! nor, perhaps may you!&mdash;He
has left England.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Impo&s;&s;ible! why Jacob told me unky was work|ing
night and day at preparations for your keeping
the wedding at Cleves?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I cannot talk upon this &s;ubject. I mu&s;t be|&s;eech
you to re&s;erve your enquiries for Eugenia&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I mu&s;t go to her then, directly. I have not a
moment to lo&s;e. If you won't make Edgar help me
in this bu&s;ine&s;s&mdash;and I know he won't do it of his
own accord, I am utterly done up. There will re|main
but one &s;ingle thing for me. So now for my
roquelo. But do only tell me, Camilla, if you ever
knew &s;uch a poor unlucky wight? for before I came
to you, certain it would not be ea&s;y to make that
young prig do any thing he had already declared
again&s;t, I found out cou&s;in Clermont. What a hand|&s;ome
coxcomb that is! Well, I told him my ca&s;e,
for one young fellow &s;oon comprehends the difficul|ties,
<PB N="139" REF="140">
of another, and begged him to a&s;k for the mo|ney
of uncle Hugh, as if for him&s;elf, telling him,
that as he was a new comer, and a new beginner, he
could not &s;o readily be refu&s;ed; and promi&s;ing to
&s;erve him as good a turn my&s;elf, when he had got a
little into our ways, and wanted it, with my good
uncle Relvil. Well! what do you think was the
next news? It's enough to make a man's hair &s;tand
an end, to &s;ee what a &s;pite fortune has taken to me!
Do you know he has got debts of his own, of one
&s;ort or another, that poor unky has never heard of,
to the amount of upwards of a thou&s;and pounds.&endq;</P>
<P>He then muffled him&s;elf up and departed.</P>

<P>CAMILLA remained in a &s;tate of accumulated
di&s;tre&s;s, that knew not upon what object mo&s;t to
dwell: her father, &s;hocked and irritated beyond the
mild endurance of his character; her brother, wan|tonly
&s;porting with his family's honour, and his own
morals and reputation; her uncle, preparing for n$p|tials
broken off without his knowledge; Edgar, by
a thou&s;and perver&s;ities of accident, of indi&s;cretion,
of mi&s;under&s;tanding, for ever parted from her;&mdash;
$u&s;hed all together upon her mind, each combating
for precedence, each individually foiled, yet all col|lectively
triumphant. Nor were even the&s;e her &s;ole
&s;ubjects of affliction: yet another cau&s;e was added,
in debts contracted from mingled thoughtle&s;&s;ne&s;s, in|experience,
and genero&s;ity, augmented to &s;he knew
not what &s;um, and to be paid by &s;he knew not what
means. And this topic, which in it&s;elf &s;eemed to
her the lea&s;t intere&s;ting, &s;oon, by the circum&s;tances
with which it was connected, grew the mo&s;t pre&s;&s;ing
<PB N="140" REF="141">
of any. How, at a moment like this, could &s;he
make her purpo&s;ed confe&s;&s;ion to her father, who&s;e
wounded mind demanded all &s;he could offer of con|dolement?
How call upon her uncle to be re&s;pon&s;ible
for what &s;he owed, when &s;he now knew the enormous
accounts preparing for him from Clermont, of which
he was him&s;elf yet uninformed?</P>
<P>Lionel &s;oon returned. &startq;So it's really all off?&endq;
he cried; &startq;dame Fortune, methinks, has a mind
to give me a ta&s;te of her art that I &s;han't ea&s;ily for|get.
Eugenia would tell me no particulars. But,
&s;ince things are thus, there is only one &s;tep left for
poor Pilgarlick. I mu&s;t whi&s;k over to the Conti|nent.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;To the Conti$ent? without con&s;ulting my fa|ther?
without&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;My father?&mdash;Why, you &s;ee he gives me up.
He thinks&mdash;I thank him!&mdash;a little whole&s;ome di&s;|cipline
will do me good. Don't you under&s;tand what
he means by <HI>&s;eclu&s;ion from the world?</HI> A pri&s;on, my
dear! a gaol! However, I'm not quite of that opi|nion.
I really think a man's as well off in a little
open air. So fare thee well child. As &s;oon as ever
my dear uncle Relvil &s;ays good night, I'll come
home again, and wi&s;h you all good morning.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Lionel! Lionel!&mdash;&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Well, well! I know it's very wrong, and all
that; &s;o &s;ay nothing. Dont't di&s;tre&s;s me, I beg,
for I hate to be hipped. Be&s;ides, old Relvil don't
de&s;erve much better; why can't he behave like a
man, and &s;ettle an annuity upon him&s;elf, and an old
&s;ervant, and a dog, and a cat, and a parrot, and then
let an hone&s;t young fellow &s;ee a little of the world
hand&s;omely, and like a gentleman? But your bache|lor
uncles, and maiden aunts, are the mo&s;t tantalizing
fellows and fellowe&s;&s;es in the creation.&endq;</P>
<P>He then ki&s;&s;ed her, and was going; but, earne&s;tly
detaining him, &s;he conjured that he would let her
<PB N="141" REF="142">
fir&s;t hint his de&s;ign to their father, that at lea&s;t it
might be &s;et a&s;ide, if it would &s;till more deeply di&s;|turb
him.</P>
<P>&startq;No child, no; I know his way of rea&s;oning
already. He thinks every man &s;hould pay for what
he owes, either with money or &s;tripes. Now my poor
dear little body is not of that opinion. And what
would they get by having me &s;hut up in pri&s;on? And
I'll defy 'em to ca&s;t me in any other damages. I've a
few debts, too of my own, that make me a little un|ea&s;y.
I don't mean to trades people; they can wait
well enough; our credit is good: but a man looks
horrid &s;mall, walking about, when he can't pay his
debts of honour. However, when I di&s;appear, per|haps
my father will take compa&s;&s;ion upon my character.
If not, the Relvil e&s;tate &s;hall wipe off all in the long
run.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;And is it po&s;&s;ible, Lionel, thus lightly, thus
negligently, thus unmoved, you can plan &s;uch a jour|ney?
&s;uch an exile?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why what can I do? what can I po&s;&s;ibly do?
I am obliged to be off in my own defence. Unle&s;s,
indeed, I marry little Mi&s;s Dennel, which I have
once or twice thought of; for &s;he's a mon&s;trous fool.
But then &s;he is very rich. How &s;hould you like her
for a &s;i&s;ter? Nay, nay, I'm &s;erious. Don't &s;hake your
head as if I was joking. What do you think of her
for my &s;pou&s;e?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;She is a good girl, I believe, Lionel, though a
&s;imple one; and I &s;hould be &s;orry to &s;ee her unhappy:

&s;uch as this?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Ble&s;s thy heart, my little dear, what have hu&s;|bands

Prithee don't &s;et about forming thy notions of
married people from the par&s;onage-hou&s;e, and conclude
a wife no better than a $eal rib, &s;ticking always clo&s;e

<P><PB N="142" REF="143">
&startq;Alas, Lionel!&mdash;how changed, how hard&mdash;for|give
me if I &s;ay how hard mu&s;t you be grown, to be
capable of gaiety and rattle at this period!&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;You'll die an old maid, Camilla, take my word
for it. And I'm really &s;orry, for you're not an ugly
girl. You might have been got off. But come, don't
look &s;o melancholy at a little &s;illy &s;port. The world
is &s;o full of &s;orrow, my dear girl, &s;o little vi&s;ited by
happine&s;s, that chearfulne&s;s is almo&s;t as nece&s;&s;ary as
exi&s;tence, in &s;uch a vale of tears.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What can induce you to laugh, Lionel, at &s;uch
words?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I can't help it, faith! I was thinking I &s;poke &s;o
like a par&s;on's &s;on!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla ca&s;t up her eyes and hands:</P>
<P>&startq;Lionel, &s;he cried, what have you done with your
heart? has it bani&s;hed every natural &s;eeling? has the
affecting letter of the be&s;t of fathers, his cruel &s;epara|tion
from the mo&s;t excellent of mothers, and even your
own dreadfully cen&s;u$able conduct, &s;erved but to
amu&s;e you with ridicule and deri&s;ion?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Camilla,&endq; cried he, taking her hands, &startq;you
wrong me! you think I have no feeling, becau&s;e I
am not always crying. However, &s;hall I tell you the
truth? I hate my&s;elf! and &s;o completely hate my&s;elf
at this moment, that I dare not be grave! dare not
&s;uffer reflection to take hold of me, left it &s;hould
make life too odious for me to bear it. I have run on
from folly to wickedne&s;s for want of thought; and now
thought is ready to come back, I mu&s;t run from that,
for want of fortitude. What has bewitched me, I
know no more than you; but I never meant to play
this abominable part. And now, if I did not flog up
my &s;pirits to prevent their flagging, I &s;uppo&s;e I &s;hould
hang or drown. And, believe me, if I were condemned
to the galleys, I &s;hould think it le&s;s than I de&s;erve;
for I hate my&s;elf, I repeat&mdash;I honour my father, though
I have u&s;ed him &s;o ill; I love my mother,&mdash;for all
her deuced &s;everity,&mdash;to the bottom of my &s;oul; I
would cut off my left arm for Lavinia and Eugenia;
and for thee, Camilla, I would lop off my right!&mdash;But
<PB N="143" REF="144">
yet, when &s;ome frolic or gambol comes into my
way, I forget you all! clear out my memory you all
walk, as if I had never beheld you!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla now embraced him with a deluge of tears,
entreated him to forgive the a&s;perity his &s;eeming
want of all feeling had drawn from her, and frequently
to write to her, and acquaint her how he went on, and
&s;end his direction for her an&s;wers; that &s;o, at lea&s;t,
their father might know how he employed him&s;elf,
and have the power to give him coun&s;el.</P>
<P>&startq;But how, my poor Lionel,&endq; &s;he added, &startq;how
will you live abroad? How will you even travel?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Why as to how I &s;hall live there, I don't know;
but as well as I de&s;erve ea&s;ily: however, as to how
I &s;hall get there, look here,&endq; taking from his pocket
a handful of guineas, &startq;that little good Eugenia has
given me every thing, even to the la&s;t half crown,
that &s;he had at Southampton, to help me forward.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Dear excellent, ever generous Eugenia! O that
I could follow her example! but alas! I have no|thing!&mdash;and
wor&s;e than nothing!!</P>
<P>They then affectionately embraced each other, and
and parted.</P>

<P>WHAT Camilla experienced at this juncture &s;he
believed inadmi&s;&s;ible of aggravation. Even the break|ing
off with Edgar &s;eemed as a new misfortune from
the new force which circum&s;tances gave to its afflic|tion.
With his &s;ympathi&s;ing aid, how might &s;he have
&s;oftened the &s;orrows of her father! how have broken
the &s;hock of the blow Clermont was preparing for her
uncle? But now in&s;tead of le&s;&s;ening their griefs, &s;he
mu&s;t her&s;elf inflict upon them a heavier evil than any
they had yet &s;uffered. And how could &s;he reveal
tidings for which they were &s;o wholly unprepared?
<PB N="144" REF="145">
how be even intelligible in the hi&s;tory, without ex|po&s;ing
the guilty Lionel beyond all chance of pardon?</P>
<P>Again &s;he went to coun&s;el with Eugenia, who, with
her u&s;ual di&s;intere&s;ted affection, propo&s;ed taking the
painful bu&s;ine&s;s upon her&s;elf at their return home.
Camilla, with tears of gratitude accepted the &s;i&s;terly
office, and re&s;olved to devote the re&s;t of her &s;hort time
for Southampton to Mrs. Berlinton; who, &s;hocked to
&s;ee her evident unhappine&s;s, hung over her with the
mo&s;t melting tenderne&s;s: bewailing alike the di&s;ap|pointment
of Eugenia, and the conduct of her brother;
who now, with exqui&s;ite mi&s;ery, &s;hut him&s;elf wholly
up in his room.</P>
<P>This compa&s;&s;ionate kindne&s;s &s;omewhat &s;oftened her
angui&s;h; but when the engagements of Mrs. Berlinton
called her away, Mrs. Mittin bur&s;t bri&s;kly into her
chamber.</P>
<P>&startq;Well, my dear,&endq; cried &s;he, &startq;I come with bet|ter
news now than ever! only gue&s;s what it is!&endq;</P>
<P>Nothing could le&s;s conduce to the tranquillity of
Camilla than &s;uch a de&s;ire; her conjectures always
flowed into the channels of her wi&s;hes; and &s;he thought
immediately that Mrs. Mitten had been informed of
her &s;ituation, and came to her with &s;ome intelligence
of Edgar.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mitten, after keeping her a full quarter of an
hour in &s;u&s;pence, at la&s;t &s;aid: &startq;Do you know Mi&s;s
Dennel's going to be married?&mdash;though &s;he was fifteen
only ye&s;terday!&mdash;and I am invited to the wedding?&endq;</P>
<P>No &s;urpri&s;e had ever yet produced le&s;s plea&s;ure to
Camilla, who now cea&s;ed to li&s;ten, though Mrs.
Mitten by no means cea&s;ed to &s;peak, till her attention
was awakened by the following &s;entence: So, as I
am to go to town, to &s;hop with her, at her own papa's
de&s;ire, you can give me the money, you know, my
dear, and I can pay off your Tunbridge bills for you.&endq;</P>
<P>She then took out of her pockets &s;ome accounts,
which, &s;he &s;aid, &s;he had ju&s;t received; though, in
fact, they had been in her po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion more than a week;
but till the invitation of Mi&s;s Dennel called her &s;o
plea&s;antly away, &s;he had thought it prudent to keep
<PB N="145" REF="146">
every motive in re&s;erve, that added importance to her
&s;tay.</P>
<P>Camilla, with the utmo&s;t apprehen&s;ion, took the
papers into her hands: they were the bills from Tun|bridge,
of the milliner, &s;he &s;hoe-maker, the haber|da&s;her,
and the glover, and amounted altogether to
&s;ixteen pounds.</P>
<P>The chief articles had been nearly forced upon her
by Mrs. Mittin, with a&s;&s;urances of their cheapne&s;s,
and repre&s;entations of their nece&s;&s;ity, that, joined to
her entire ignorance of the enormous charges of fa&s;hion,
had led her to imagine four or five guineas the utmo&s;t
&s;um at which they could be e&s;timated.</P>
<P>What now, then, was her horror! if to &s;ixteen
pounds amounted the trifles &s;he had had at Tunbridge,
what calculation mu&s;t &s;he make of articles, &s;o infinitely
more valuable, that belonged to her debts at Southamp|ton?
And to whom now could &s;he apply? The un|happy
&s;ituation of her father was no longer an only
rea&s;on to forbear &s;uch a call upon him: Lionel, &s;till
under age, was flying the kingdom with debts, which,
be they &s;mall as they might, would, to Mr. Tyrold's
limited income, be as heavy as the more con&s;iderable
ones of her cou&s;in upon Sir Hugh; yet who be&s;ides
could give her aid? Eugenia, who&s;e yearly allow|ance,
according to her &s;ettled future fortune, was five
times that of her &s;i&s;ters, had given what help &s;he had
in her power, before &s;he quitted Cleves, upon the
affair of the hor&s;e; and all that remained of a con|&s;iderable
pre&s;ent made for her Southampton expedition
by her uncle, who in every thing di&s;tingui&s;hed her
as his &s;ucce&s;&s;or and heire&s;s, &s;he had ju&s;t be&s;towed
upon Lionel, even, as he had declared, to her la&s;t
half-crown. Mrs. Berlinton, who&s;e tender friend&s;hip
might, in this emergence, have encouraged &s;olicita|tion,
was involved in debts of honour, and wanted
money for her&s;elf; and to Mrs. Arlbery, her only
other acquaintance rich enough to give a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and
with whom &s;he was intimate enough to a&s;k it, &s;he al|ready
owed five guineas; and how in con&s;cience or
decency, could &s;he addre&s;s her for &s;o much more,
<PB N="146" REF="147">
when &s;he &s;aw before her no time, no term, upon
which &s;he could fix for re&s;titution?</P>
<P>In this terrible &s;tate, with no one to coun&s;el her,
and no powers of &s;elf-judgment, &s;he felt a dread
of going home, that rendered the coming day a
day of horror, though to a home to which, hither|to,
&s;he had turned as the fir&s;t joy of her happine&s;s,
or &s;ofte&s;t &s;olace of any di&s;turbance. Her filial
affections were in their pri&s;tine force; her &s;hort
commerce with the world had robbed them of
none of their vivacity; her regard for Edgar,
whom &s;he delighted to con&s;ider as a younger Mr.
Tyrold, had rather enlarged than divided them;
but to return a burthen to an already burthened
hou&s;e, an affliction to an already afflicted parent&mdash;&startq;No!&endq;
&s;he broke out, aloud, &startq;I cannot go
home!&mdash;I cannot carry calamity to my father!&mdash;He
will be mild&mdash;but he will look unhappy; and
I would not &s;ee his face in &s;orrow&mdash;&s;orrow of my
own creating&mdash;for years of after joy!&endq;</P>
<P>She threw her&s;elf down upon the bed, hid her
face with the counterpane, and wept, in de&s;perate
carele&s;sle&s;s of the pre&s;ence of Mrs. Mittin, and an|&s;wering
nothing that &s;he &s;aid.</P>
<P>In affairs of this &s;ort, Mrs. Mittin had a quick|ne&s;s
of apprehen&s;ion, which, though but the
attribute of ready cunning, was not inferior to the
keene&s;t penetration, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, for deeper inve&s;tiga|tions,
by characters of more &s;olid &s;agacity. From
the fear which Camilla, in her angui&s;h, had ut|tered
of &s;eeing her father, &s;he gathered, there mu&s;t
be &s;ome &s;evere re&s;triction in money concerns; and,
without troubling her&s;elf to con&s;ider what they
might be, &s;aw that to aid her at this moment
would be the highe&s;t obligation; and immediately
&s;et at work a brain as fertile in worldly expedi|ents,
as it was barren of intellectual endowments,
in forming a plan of pre&s;ent relief, which &s;he con|cluded
would gain her a rich and powerful friend
for life.</P>
<P><PB N="147" REF="148">
She was not long in &s;ugge&s;ting a propo&s;ition,
which Camilla &s;tarted up eagerly to hear, almo&s;t
breathle&s;s with the hope of any reprieve to her
terrors.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin, among&s;t her numerous friends,
counted a Mr. Clykes, a money-lender, a man, &s;he
&s;aid, of the fir&s;t credit for &s;uch matters with people
of fa&s;hion in any difficulty. If Camilla, therefore,
would collect her debts, this gentleman would pay
them, for a hand&s;ome premium, and hand&s;ome
intere&s;t, till &s;he was able, at her own full lei&s;ure,
to return the principal, with a proper pre&s;ent.</P>
<P>Camilla nearly embraced her with rapture for
this &s;cheme. The premium &s;he would collect as
&s;he could, and the intere&s;t &s;he would pay from her
allowance, certain that when her uncle was cleared
from his embarra&s;&s;ments, her own might be re|vealed
without any &s;erious di&s;tre&s;s. She put,
therefore, the affair wholly into the hands of Mrs.
Mittin, be&s;ought her, the next morning, to de|mand
all her Southampton bills, to add to them
tho&s;e for the rent and &s;tores of Higden, and then to
tran&s;act the bu&s;ine&s;s with Mr. Clykes; promi&s;ing
to agree to whatever premium, intere&s;t, and pre|&s;ent,
he &s;hould demand, with endle&s;s acknowledg|ments
to her&s;elf for &s;o great a &s;ervice.</P>
<P>She grieved to employ a per&s;on &s;o utterly di&s;a|greeable
to Edgar; but to avert immediate evil
was ever re&s;i&s;tle&s;s to her ardent mind.</P>
<P>The whole of the Southampton accounts were
brought her early the next morning by the active
Mrs. Mittin, who now concluded, that what &s;he
had conceived to be covetou&s;ne&s;s in Camilla, was
only the fear of a hard tyrant of a father, who
kept her &s;o par&s;imoniou&s;ly, that &s;he could allow
her&s;elf no indulgence, till the death of her uncle
&s;hould endow her with her own rich inheritance.</P>
<P>Had this arrangement not taken place before the
arrival of the bills, Camilla, upon beholding them,
thought &s;he &s;hould have been driven to complete
di&s;traction. The ear-rings and necklace, &s;ilver
<PB N="148" REF="149">
fringes and &s;pangles, feathers, no&s;egay, and &s;hoe-ro&s;es,
with the other parts of the dre&s;s, and the
fine Valencienne edging, came to thirty-three
pounds. The cloak al&s;o, that cheape&s;t thing in
the world, was nine guineas; and various &s;mall
articles, which Mrs. Mittin had occa&s;ionally brought
in, and others with which Camilla could not di&s;|pen&s;e,
came to another five pounds. To this, the
rent for Higden added eighteen; and the bill of
&s;tores, which had been calculated at thirty, was
&s;ent in at thirty-&s;even.</P>
<P>The whole therefore, with the &s;ixteen pounds
from Tunbridge, amounted to one hundred and
eighteen pounds nine &s;hillings.</P>
<P>Struck to the very &s;oul with the idea of what &s;he
mu&s;t have endured to have pre&s;ented, at &s;uch a
period, &s;o large an account, either at Cleves or at
Etherington, &s;he felt lifted into paradi&s;e by the
e&s;cape of this expedient, and lo&s;t &s;ight of every
po&s;&s;ible future difficulty, in the relief of avoiding
&s;o &s;evere a pre&s;ent penalty.</P>
<P>By this means, al&s;o, the trade&s;men would not
wait; and &s;he had been educated with &s;o ju&s;t an
abhorrence of receiving the goods, and benefiting
from the labours of others, without &s;peeding them
their rights and their rewards, that &s;he felt de&s;|picable
as well as mi&s;erable, when &s;he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed
what &s;he had not repaid.</P>
<P>Mrs. Mittin was now inve&s;ted with full powers
for the agency, which her journey to London
would give her immediate means to execute. She
was to meet Mi&s;s Dennel there in two days to a&s;&s;i&s;t
in the wedding purcha&s;es, and then to accompany
that young lady to her father's hou&s;e in Hamp&s;hire,
whence &s;he could vi&s;it Etherington, and finally
arrange the $ran&s;action.</P>
<P>Camilla, again thanking, took leave of her, to
con&s;ign her few remaining hours to Mrs. Berlinton,
who was impatient at lo&s;ing one moment of the
&s;ociety &s;he began &s;incerely to regret &s;he had not
more uniformly preferred to all other. As &s;ad
<PB N="149" REF="150">
now with cares as Camilla was with afflictions, &s;he
had robbed her &s;ituation of nearly the only good
which belonged to it&mdash;an affluent power to gratify
every luxury, whether of genero&s;ity or per&s;onal
indulgence. Her gaming, to want of happine&s;s,
added now want of money; and Camilla, with a
&s;igh, &s;aw &s;omething more wretched, becau&s;e far
deeper and more wilful in error than her&s;elf.</P>
<P>They mingled their tears for their &s;eparate per|&s;onal
evils, with the kinde&s;t con&s;olation that either
could &s;ugge&s;t for the other, till Camilla was told
that Eugenia de&s;ired to &s;ee her in the parlour.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton, a&s;hamed, yet delighted to meet
her again, went down at the &s;ame time. She em|braced
her with fondne&s;s, but ventured not to
utter either apology or concern. Eugenia was
&s;erious but compo&s;ed, &s;ighed often, yet both ac|cepted
and returned her care&s;&s;es.</P>
<P>Camilla enquired if Mi&s;s Margland expected
them immediately.</P>
<P>&startq;Yes,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered; &startq;but I have fir&s;t a little
bu&s;ine&s;s of my own to tran&s;act.&endq; Then, turning
to Mrs. Berlinton, and forcing a &s;mile, &startq;You
will be &s;urpri&s;ed,&endq; &s;he &s;aid, &startq;to hear me a&s;k for
.&hellip; your brother! &hellip; but I mu&s;t &s;ee him be|fore
I can leave Southampton.&endq;</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton hung her head: There is cer|tainly,&endq;
&s;he cried, &startq;no reproach he does not me|rit
&hellip; yet, if you knew &hellip; the re&s;pect &hellip; the
&hellip; the &hellip;&endq;</P>
<P>Eugenia rang the bell, making a &s;light apology,
but not li&s;tening to what Mrs. Berlinton &s;trove to
&s;ay; who, colouring and unea&s;y, &s;till attempted
to utter &s;omething &s;oftening to what had pa&s;&s;ed.</P>
<P>&startq;Be &s;o good,&endq; &s;aid Eugenia, when the footman
appeared, &startq;to tell Mr. Melmond I beg to &s;peak
with him.&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla a&s;toni&s;hed, and Mrs. Berlinton &s;ilenced,
waited, in an unplea&s;ant pau&s;e, the event.</P>
<P>Eugenia, ab&s;orbed in thought, neither &s;poke to,
nor looked at them, nor moved, till the door
<PB N="150" REF="151">
opened, and Melmond, who dur&s;t not refu&s;e &s;o
direct a &s;ummons, though he would have preferred
any puni&s;hment to obeying it, blu&s;hing, bowing,
and trembling, entered the room.</P>
<P>She then &s;tarted, half heaved, and half checked
a &s;igh, took a folded note out of her pocket-book,
and with a faint &s;mile, &s;aid, &startq;I fear my de&s;ire
mu&s;t have been painful to you; but you &s;ee me
now for the la&s;t time&mdash;I hope!&mdash;without any ill-will.&endq;</P>
<P>She &s;topt for breath to go on; Melmond, amaz|ed,
&s;triving vainly to articulate one word of ex|cu&s;e,
one profe&s;&s;ion even of re&s;pect.</P>
<P>&startq;Believe me, Sir,&endq; &s;he then continued, &startq;&s;urpri&s;e
was the la&s;t &s;en&s;ation I experienced upon a late&hellip;
tran&s;action. My extraordinary per&s;onal defects
and deformity have been &s;ome time known to me,
though&mdash;I cannot tell how&mdash;I had the weakne&s;s or
vanity not to think of them as I ought to have
done!&mdash;&mdash;But I &s;ee I give you$ unea&s;ine&s;s, and
therefore I will be more conci&s;e.&endq;</P>
<P>Melmond, confounded, had bowed down his
head not to look at her, while Camilla and Mrs.
Berlinton both wept.</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;entiments, Sir,&endq; &s;he then went on, &startq;of
my cou&s;in have never been declared to me; but it
is not very difficult to me to divine what they may
be. All that is certain, is the unkindne&s;s of For|tune,
which forbids her to li&s;ten or, or you to
plead to them. This, Sir, it &s;hall be my care&endq;&mdash;&s;he
&s;topt a moment, looking paler, and wanting
voice; but pre&s;ently recovering, proceeded&mdash;&startq;my
happine&s;s, let me &s;ay, to endeavour to rectify. I
have much influence with my kind uncle; can I
doubt, when I repre&s;ent to him that I have ju&s;t
e&s;caped making two worthy people wretched, he
will deny aiding me to make them happy? No!
the re&s;idence already intended at Cleves will &s;till
be open, though one of its parties will be changed.
But as my uncle, in a manner unexampled, has
bound him&s;elf, in my favour, from any future di&s;|po&s;ition
<PB N="151" REF="152">
of what he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;es, I have ventured, Sir,
upon this paper, to obviate any apprehen&s;ions of
your friends, for the unhappy time when that ge|nerous
uncle can no longer act for him&s;elf.&endq;</P>
<P>She then unfolded, and gave him the paper,
which contained the&s;e words:</P>
<P>&startq;I here &s;olemnly engage my&s;elf, if Mi&s;s Indiana
Lynmere accepts, with the con&s;ent of Sir Hugh

</DIV2>
<DIV2>
<P>Unable to read, yet conceiving the purport of
the writing, Melmond was at her feet. She endea|voured
to rai&s;e him, and though extremely affect|ed,
&s;aid, with an air of &s;ome plea&s;antry, &startq;Shew
le&s;s &s;urpri&s;e, Sir, or I &s;hall conclude you thought
me as frightful within as without! But no! Pro|vidence
is too good to make the mind nece&s;&s;arily

<P>&startq;Ah, Madam! exclaimed Melmond, wholly
overcome, the noble&s;t as well as &s;ofte&s;t of human

<P>&startq;No more, no more!&endq; interrupted &s;he, pene|trated
with a plea&s;ure in the&s;e words which &s;he
dur&s;t not indulge, &startq;you &s;hall hear from me &s;oon.
Meanwhile, be Hope your motto, Friend&s;hip &s;hall
be mine.&endq;</P>
<P>She was then going to hold out her hand to
him; but her courage failed; &s;he ha&s;tily embraced
Mrs. Berlinton, took the arm of Camilla, and
hurried out of the hou&s;e, followed by the footman
who had attended her.</P>
<P>Melmond, who had &s;een the motion of her hand
now advancing, now withdrawn, would have
given the univer&s;e to have &s;tamped upon it his
grateful reverence; but his courage was &s;till le&s;s
<PB N="152" REF="153">
than her own; &s;he &s;eemed to him, on the &s;udden,
transformed to a deity, benignly employed to re&s;|cue
and ble&s;s him, but who&s;e tran&s;cendent good|ne&s;s,
he could only at a di&s;tance, and in all humi|lity,
adore.</P>
<P>Mrs. Berlinton was left penetrated nearly as
much as her brother, and doubtful if even the
divine Indiana could render him as happy as the
exalted, the incomparable Eugenia.</P>
<P>The two &s;i&s;ters found Mi&s;s Margland in extreme
ill-humour waiting their arrival, and the whole
party immediately quitted Southampton.</P>
<P>It not &s;eldom occurred to Mi&s;s Margland to be
cro&s;s merely as a mark of con&s;equence; but here
the di&s;plea&s;ure was deep with her&s;elf as with others.
She had entered Southampton with a per&s;ua&s;ion
her fair pupil would make there the e&s;tabli&s;hment,
&s;o long the promi&s;ed mede of her confinement;
and Indiana her&s;elf, not knowing where to &s;top
her &s;anguine and inflated hopes, imagined that the
fame of her beauty would make the place where
it was fir&s;t exhibited the re&s;ort of all of fa&s;hion in
the nation. And the opening of the &s;cene an&s;wer|ed
their fulle&s;t expectations: no other name was
heard but Indiana Lynmere, no other figure was
admired, no other face could bear examination.</P>
<P>But her triumph, though &s;plendid, was &s;hort;
&s;he &s;oon found that the overtures of eyes were
more ready than tho&s;e of &s;peech; and though one
young baronet, enchanted with her beauty, im|mediately
profe&s;&s;ed him&s;elf her lover, when he
was di&s;dained, in the full a&s;&s;urance of higher offers,
and becau&s;e a peer had addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to Euge|nia,
&s;he &s;aw not that he was &s;ucceeded by any
other, nor yet that he broke his own heart. Men
of ta&s;te, after the fir&s;t conver&s;ation, found her
more admirable to look at than &s;peak with; ad|venturers
&s;oon di&s;covered that her per&s;onal charms
were her only dower; the common herd were re|pul&s;ed
from approaching her by the repul&s;ive man|ners
of Mi&s;s Margland; and all evinced, that
<PB N="153" REF="154">
though a pa&s;&s;ion for beauty was &s;till as fa&s;hionable
as it was natural, the time was pa&s;t when the
altar of Hymen required no other incen&s;e to
blaze upon it.</P>
<P>The governe&s;s, therefore, and the pupil, quit|ted
Southampton with equal di&s;appointment and
indignation; the fir&s;t fore&s;eeing another long and
yawning &s;ojourn at Cleves; the &s;econd firmly be|lieving
her&s;elf the mo&s;t unaccountably ill u&s;ed
per&s;on in the creation, that one offer only had
reached her, and that without repetition, though
admired nearly to adoration, &s;he literally rather
than metaphorically conceived her&s;elf a de$$|godde&s;s.</P>
<P>One &s;olitary offer to Eugenia, of an every $ay
ruined young nobleman, though a bla&s;t both to
the &s;ettlement and the peace of Indiana, was to
her&s;elf wholly nugatory. Intent, at that period,
upon dedicating for ever to Melmond he$ virgir$
heart, &s;he was &s;orry, upon his account, for the ap|plication,
but gave it not, upon her own, a mo|ment's
con&s;ideration. This propo&s;ition was made
upon her fir&s;t arrival, and was followed by no
other. She was then, by the account given to the
ma&s;ter of the ceremonies by Mi&s;s Margland, re|garded
as the heire&s;s of Cleves: but, almo&s;t im|mediately
after, the report &s;pread by Mrs. Mittin,
that Camilla was the true heire&s;s, gained &s;uch
ground among&s;t the &s;hop-keepers, and thence tra|velled
&s;o rapidly from go&s;&s;ip to go&s;&s;ip, and hou&s;e
to hou&s;e, that Eugenia was &s;oon no more thought
of; though a &s;pecies of doubt was ca&s;t upon the
whole party, from the double a&s;&s;ertion, that kept
off from Camilla, al&s;o, the fortune &s;eekers of
the place.</P>
<P>But another rumour got abroad, that &s;oon en|tirely
cleared Eugenia, not merely of lovers but
acquaintances; namely, her &s;tudies with Dr. Ork|borne.
This was a prevailing theme of &s;pite with
Mi&s;s Margland, when the Doctor had neglected
and di&s;plea&s;ed her; and a topic always at hand for
<PB N="154" REF="155">
her &s;pleen, when it was angered by other circum|&s;tances
not &s;o ea&s;y of blame or of mention.</P>
<P>This, &s;hortly, made Eugenia &s;tared at &s;till more
than her peculiar appearance. The mi&s;&s;es, in tit|tering,
ran away from the learned lady; the bea$$
contemptuou&s;ly &s;neering, rejoiced &s;he was too
ugly to take in any poor fellow to marry her.
Some imagined her &s;tudies had &s;tinted her growth;
and all were convinced her education had made her
&s;uch a fright.</P>
<P>Of the whole party, the only one who quitted
Southampton in &s;pirits was Dr. Orkborne. He
was delighted to be no longer under the dominion
of Mi&s;s Margland, who, though &s;he never left
him tranquil in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all he valued, his
lei&s;ure, and his books and papers, eternally an|noyed
him with reproaches upon his ab&s;ence, non-attendance,
and ignorance of high life; a&s;king
always, when angry, &startq;If any one had ever heard
who was his grandfather?&endq;</P>
<P>The doctor, in return, de&s;pi&s;ing, like mo&s;t who
have it not, whatever belonged to noble birth, re|garded
her and her progenitors as the pe&s;t of the
human race; frequently when incen&s;ed by interrup|tion,
exclaiming, &startq;Where intellect is uncultivated,
what is man better than a brute, or woman than
an ideot?&endq;</P>
<P>Nor was his return to his own room, books,
and hours, under the roof of the indulgent Sir
Hugh, the only relief of this removal; he knew
not of the previous departure of Dr. Marchmont,
and he was glad to quit a &s;pot where he was open
to a compari&s;on which he felt to be always to his
di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>So much more powerful and more prominent is
character than education, that no two men could
be more different than Dr. Marchmont and Dr.
Orkborne, though the &s;ame univer&s;ity had fini&s;hed
their &s;tudies, and the &s;ame pa&s;&s;ion, pur&s;uit, and
&s;ucce&s;s in re&s;pect to learning, had rai&s;ed and &s;pread
their names and celebrity. The fir&s;t, with all his
<PB N="155" REF="156">
&s;chola&s;tic endowments, was a man of the world,
and a grace to &s;ociety; the &s;econd, though in
erudition equally re&s;pectable, was wholly lo&s;t to
the general community, and alive only with his pen
and his books. They enjoyed, indeed, in common,
that happy and often &s;ole reward of learned la|bours,
the privilege of &s;natching &s;ome care from
time, &s;ome repining from misfortune, by &s;eizing
for them&s;elves, and their own exclu&s;ive u&s;e, the
whole monopoly of mind; but they employed it
not to the &s;ame exten&s;ion. The things and people
of this lower &s;phere were &s;tudiou&s;ly, by Dr. Ork|borne,
&s;unk in oblivion by the domineering pre|valence
of the alternate tran&s;port and toil of in|tellectual
occupation; Dr. Marchmont, on the
contrary, though his education led to the &s;ame
propen&s;ities, &s;till held his fellow-creatures to be of
higher con&s;ideration than their productions.
Without &s;uch extravagance in the pur&s;uit of his
&s;tudies, he knew it the happy province of literary
occupations, where voluntary, to ab&s;orb worldly
&s;olicitudes, and bani&s;h for a while even mental
anxieties; and though the charm may be broken
by every fre&s;h intru&s;ion of calamity, it unites
again with the fir&s;t retirement, and, without di|mini&s;hing
the feelings of &s;ocial life, has a power,
from time to time, to &s;et a&s;ide their &s;ufferings.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">Brides and no Brides.</HEAD>
<P>IN the hall of the Cleves man&s;ion the party from
Southampton were received by Sir Hugh, Mr.
Tyrold, and Lavinia. The baronet greeted in par|ticular
the two nieces he regarded as brides elect,
with an elation that prevented him from ob&s;erving
their &s;adne&s;s; while their confu&s;ion at his mi&s;take
<PB N="156" REF="157">
he attributed to the mere ba&s;hfulne&s;s of their &s;itu|ation.
He enquired, neverthele&s;s, with &s;ome
&s;urpri&s;e, why the two bridegrooms did not attend
them? which, he owned, he thought rather odd;
though he &s;uppo&s;ed it might be the only new way.</P>
<P>The changing colour and &s;tarting tears of the
two &s;i&s;ters &s;till e&s;caped his kindly occupied but un|di&s;cerning
eyes: while Mr. Tyrold, having ten|derly
embraced, avoided looking at them from the
fear of adding to their blu&s;hes, and &s;at quiet and
grave, &s;triving to alleviate his pre&s;ent new and
deep &s;orrow, by participating in the revived hap|pine&s;s
of his brother. But Lavinia &s;oon &s;aw their
mutual di&s;tre&s;s, and with apprehen&s;ive affection
watched an opportunity to inve&s;tigate its cau&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;But come,&endq; cried Sir Hugh, &startq;I &s;han't wait
for tho&s;e gentlemen to &s;hew you what I've done
for you, &s;eeing they don't wait for me, by their
following their own way, which, however, I &s;up|po&s;e
they may be with their lawyers, none of tho&s;e
gentlemen having been here, which I think rather
$low, con&s;idering the rooms are almo&s;t ready.&endq;</P>
<P>He would now have taken them round the hou&s;e;
but, nearly expiring with &s;hame, they entreated
to be excu&s;ed; and, in&s;upportably oppre&s;&s;ed by the
cruel di&s;covery they had to divulge, &s;tole apart to
con&s;ult upon what mea&s;ures they &s;hould take.
They then &s;ettled that Camilla &s;hould accompany
Mr. Tyrold to Etherington, but keep off all di&s;|clo&s;ure
till the next morning, when Eugenia
would arrive, and unfold the &s;ad tidings.</P>
<P>When they returned to the parlour, they found
Sir Hugh, in the innocency of his heart, had
forced Indiana, Mi&s;s Margland, and even Dr. Ork|borne,
to view his improvements for the expected
nuptials, judging the di&s;intere&s;tedne&s;s of their
plea&s;ure by his own; though to the two ladies,
nothing could be le&s;s gratifying than preparations
for a &s;cene in which they were to bear no part,
and the Doctor thought every evil genius at work to
detain him from his &s;tudy and his manu&s;cripts.</P>
<P><PB N="157" REF="158">
&startq;But what's the odde&s;t&endq; cried the Baronet,
&startq;of all, is nobody's coming for poor Indiana;
which I could never have expected, e&s;pecially in
the point of taking off little Eugenia fir&s;t, whom
her own cou&s;in did not think pretty enough;
which I can never think over and above good na|tured
in him, being &s;o difficult. However, I hope
we &s;hall &s;oon forget that, now for which rea&s;on,
I forgive him.&endq;</P>
<P>Indiana was &s;o much piqued, &s;he could &s;carce
refrain from relating the portico hi&s;tory at lord
Pervil's; but the Baronet, not remarking her di&s;|compo&s;ure,
turned to Camilla and Eugenia, &s;mi|lingly
exclaiming: &startq;Well, my dear girls, I &s;ha'n't
mention what we have been looking at in your
ab&s;ence, becau&s;e of your blu&s;hes, which I hope
you approve. But we &s;hall &s;oon, I hope, &s;ee it
all together, without any of your mode&s;ty's mind|ing
it. I &s;hall have to pinch a little for it the re&s;t
of the year, which, God knows, will be a plea|&s;ure
to me, for the &s;ake of my two dear girls, as
well as Mr. Edgar; not to mention the new young
gentleman; who &s;eems a pretty kind of per&s;on
too, though he is not one of our own relations.&endq;</P>
<P>He was rather di&s;appointed when he found
Camilla was to go to Etherington, but de&s;ired
there might be a general meeting the next day,
when he &s;hould al&s;o invite Dr. Marchmont. &startq;For
I think&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;he's as little proud as the be&s;t
dance among&s;t us; which makes me like him as
well. And I can't &s;ay but I was as much obliged
to him that day about the mad bull, as if he had
been one of my nephews or nieces him&s;elf: which
is what I &s;ha'n't forget.&endq;</P>
<P>In the way back to Etherington, Camilla could
&s;carce utter a word; and Lavinia, who had ju&s;t
gathered from her, in a whi&s;per &startq;All is over
with Edgar!&endq; with divided, but &s;ilent pity, looked
from her father to her &s;i&s;ter, thought of her bro|ther,
and wept for all three. Mr. Tyrold alone
was capable of any exertion. Unwilling to give
<PB N="158" REF="159">
Camilla, whom he concluded impre&s;&s;ed with the
thou&s;and &s;olicitudes of her impending change of
&s;ituation, any abrupt account of her brother's
cruel conduct, he &s;poke with compo&s;ure though
not with $word$lne&s;s, and hoped, by a general
gravity, to prepare, without alarming her, for the
ill $word$ he mu&s;t inevitably $word$ But he &s;oon,
however, ob&s;erved an exce&s;s of &s;adne&s;s upon her
countenance, far deeper than what he could attri|bute
to the thoughts he had fir&s;t &s;ugge&s;ted and
wholly different from an ag$$ation in which though
fear bears a part, hope preponderates.</P>
<P>It now &s;truck him that probably Lionel had
been at Southampton: for &s;o wide was every idea
from &s;uppo&s;ing any mi&s;chief with Edgar, that,
like Sir Hugh, upon his non appearance, he had
concluded him engaged with his lawyer. But of
Melmond, le&s;s &s;ure, he had been more open in en|quiry,
and with inexpre&s;&s;ible concern, for his be|loved
and unfortunate Eugenia, gathered that the
affair was ended: though her &s;ucceding plan by her
own de&s;ire, Camilla left for her own explanation.</P>
<P>When they arrived at Etherington, taking her
into his &s;tudy, &startq;Camilla,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;tell me, I
beg&hellip; do you know any thing of Lionel&endq;</P>
<P>An unre&s;trained bur&s;t of tears convinced him
his conjecture was right, and he &s;oon obtained all
the particulars of the meeting except its levity
and flightine&s;s. Where directly que&s;tioned, no
&s;i&s;terly ten lerne&s;s could induce her to filial preva|rication;
but &s;he rejoiced to &s;pare her brother all
expo&s;ure that m$re &s;ilence could &s;pare; and as Mr.
Tyrold &s;u&s;pected not her former knowledge of his
extravagance and ill conduct, he neither a&s;ked, nor
heard, any thing beyond the la&s;t interview,</P>
<P>At the plan of going abroad, he &s;ighed heavily,
but would take no mea&s;ures to prevent it. Lionel,
he &s;aw was certain of being ca&s;t in any trial; and
though he would not &s;tretch out his arm to avert
the puni&s;hment he thought de&s;erved, he was not
&s;orry to change the languid wa&s;te of impri&s;on|ment
<PB N="159" REF="160">
at home, for the hard&s;hips with which he
might live upon little abroad.</P>
<P>A calamity &s;uch as this &s;eemed cau&s;e full &s;uffici|ent
for the di&s;tre&s;s of Camilla; Mr. Tyrold &s;ought
no other; but though &s;he wept, now, at liberty,
his very freedom from &s;u&s;picion and enquiry in|crea&s;ed
her angui&s;h. &startq;Your happy fate,&endq; cried
he, &startq;is what mo&s;t, at this moment &s;upports me;
and to that I &s;hall chiefly owe the &s;upport of
your mother; whom a blow &s;uch as this will more
bitterly try than the lo&s;s of our whole income,
or even than the life it&s;elf of your brother. Her
virtue is above misfortune, but her &s;oul will &s;hud|der
at guilt.&endq;</P>
<P>The horror of Camilla was nearly intolerable
at this &s;peech, and the dreadful di&s;appointment
which &s;he knew yet to be awaiting her loved pa|rents.
&startq;Take comfort, my deare&s;t girl,&endq; &s;aid Mr.
Tyrold, who &s;aw her &s;uffering, &startq;it is yours, for
all our &s;akes to be chearful, for to you we &s;hall
owe the worthie&s;t of &s;ons, at the piercing juncture
when the weake&s;t and mo&s;t faulty fails us.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O my father!&endq; &s;he cried, &startq;&s;peak not &s;uch
words! Lionel him&s;elf&hellip;&endq; &s;he was going to &s;ay:
has made you le&s;s unhappy than you will be made
by me: but &s;he dur&s;t not fini&s;h her phra&s;e; &s;he
turned away from him her &s;treaming eyes, and &s;topt.</P>
<P>&startq;My deare&s;t child,&endq; he cried, &startq;let not your
ri&s;ing pro&s;pects be thus dampt by this cruel event.
The connection you have formed will be a con&s;ola|tion
to us all. It binds to us for life a character
already &s;o dear to us; it will afford to our Lavinia,
&s;hould we leave her &s;ingle, a certain a&s;ylum; it
will give to our Eugenia a coun&s;ellor that may
&s;ave her hereafter from fraud and ruin; it may
aid poor Lionel, when, &s;ome time hence, he re|turns
to his country, to return to the right path,
whence &s;o widely he has &s;trayed; and it will heal
with lenient balm the wounded, bleeding bo&s;om
of a meritorious but deeply afflicted mother!
While to your father, my Camilla&hellip;&endq;</P>
<P><PB N="160" REF="161">
The&s;e la&s;t words were not heard; &s;uch a mention
of her mother had already overpowered her, and un|able
to let him keep up his delu&s;ion, &s;he &s;upported her
&s;haking frame again&s;t his &s;houlder, and exclaimed in
a tone of agony: &startq;O my father! you harrow me
to the &s;oul!&mdash;Edgar has left me!&mdash;has left England!
&mdash;left us all!&endq;&mdash;&mdash;</P>
<P>Shocked, yet nearly incredulous, he in&s;i&s;ted upon
looking at her: her countenance impelled belief. The
woe it expre&s;&s;ed could be excited by nothing le&s;s than
the deprivation of every worldly expectation, and a
&s;ingle glance was an an&s;wer to a thou&s;and interroga|tories.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now &s;at down, with an air between
calmne&s;s and de&s;pondence, &s;aying, &startq;And how has
this come to pa&s;s?&endq;</P>
<P>Again &s;he got behind him, and in a voice &s;carce
audible, &s;aid, Eugenia would, the next morning, ex|plain
all.</P>
<P>&startq;Very well, I will wait;&endq; he quietly, but with pal|pably
&s;tifled emotions, an&s;wered: &startq;Go, my love, go
to Lavinia; open to her your heart; you will find
con&s;olation in her kindne&s;s. My own, I confe&s;s, is
now weighed down with &s;orrow! this la&s;t and unex|pected
&s;troke will demand &s;ome time, &s;ome &s;olitude,
to be yielded to as it ought.&endq; He then held out to
her his hand, which &s;he could &s;carcely approach from
trembling, and &s;carcely ki&s;s for weeping, and added:
&startq;I know what you feel for me&mdash;and know, too, that
my lo&s;s to yours is nothing,&mdash;for yours is not to be
e&s;timated! you are young, however, and, with your|&s;elf
it may pa&s;s away.&hellip; but your mother&mdash;my
heart, Camilla, is rent for your unfortunate mo|ther!&endq;</P>
<P>He then embraced her, called Lavinia, and retired
for the night.</P>
<P>Terribly it pa&s;&s;ed with them all.</P>
<P>The next morning, before they a&s;&s;embled to break|fa&s;t,
Eugenia was in the chamber of Camilla.</P>
<P><PB N="161" REF="162">
She entered with a bright beam upon her counte|nance,
which, in defiance of the ravaging di&s;temper
that had altered her, gave it an expre&s;&s;ion almo&s;t ce|le&s;tial.
It was the pure emanation of virtue, of di&s;|intere&s;ted,
of even heroic virtue. &startq;Camilla,&endq; &s;he
cried, &startq;all is &s;ettled with my uncle! Indiana &hellip;
you will not wonder&mdash;con&s;ents; and already this
morning I have written to Mr. Mel&mdash;$&endq;</P>
<P>With all her exultation, her voice faultered at the
name, and, with a faint &s;mile, but deep blu&s;h, &s;he
called for the congratulations of her &s;i&s;ter upon her
&s;peedy &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>&startq;Ah, far more than my congratulations, my e&s;|teem,
my veneration is yours, dear and generous Eu|genia!
true daughter of my mother! and proude&s;t
recompence of my father!</P>
<P>She was not &s;ufficiently &s;erene to give any particu|lars
of the tran&s;action; and Mr. Tyrold &s;oon &s;ent for
her to his room.</P>
<P>Camilla, trembling and hanging over her, &s;aid:
&startq;You will do for me, I know, better than I could
do for my&s;elf;&mdash;but &s;pare poor Lionel&mdash;and be ju&s;t

<P>Eugenia &s;trictly obeyed: in &s;paring Lionel &s;he
&s;pared al&s;o her father, whom his highly unfeeling be|haviour
with regard to Sir Sedley would yet further
have incen&s;ed and grieved; and, in doing ju&s;tice to
Edgar, &s;he flattered her&s;elf &s;he prevented an aliena|tion
from one yet de&s;tined to be nearly allied to him,
&s;ince time, &s;he &s;till hoped, would effect the reconci|liation
of Camilla with the youth whom&mdash;next to
Melmond&mdash;&s;he thought the mo&s;t amiable upon earth.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, by this means, gathered no further
intelligence than that they had parted upon &s;ome mu|tual,
though &s;light di&s;&s;atisfaction. He hoped, there|fore,
with Eugenia, they might &s;oon meet again;
and re&s;olved, till he could better judge what might
prove the event, to keep this di&s;tre&s;s from Sir Hugh.</P>
<P>He then met Camilla with the mo&s;t con&s;olatory
kindne&s;s; yet would not tru&s;t her ardent mind with
<PB N="162" REF="163">
the hopes he cheri&s;hed him&s;elf, dreading infinitely
more to give than to receive di&s;appointment. He
blamed her for admitting any doubts of the true re|gard
of Edgar, in whom promi&s;e was always &s;hort
of performance, and whom he conceived di&s;plea&s;ed
by unju&s;t &s;u&s;picions, or offended by undue expecta|tions
of profe&s;&s;ions, which the very &s;incerity of his
rational and manly character prevented him from
making.</P>
<P>Camilla heard in &s;ilence &s;ugge&s;tions &s;he could not
an&s;wer, without relating the hi&s;tory of Sir Sedley:
&startq;No, Lionel, no!&endq; &s;he &s;aid to her&s;elf, &startq;I will not
now betray you! I have lo&s;t all!&mdash;and now the lo&s;s
to me is irreparable, &s;hall I bla&s;t you yet further to
my poor father, who&s;e deepe&s;t &s;igh is already for
your mi&s;conduct?&endq;</P>
<P>The &s;tory of Eugenia her&s;elf he learnt with true
admiration, and gave to her magnanimity its deare&s;t
mede, in her mother's promi&s;ed, and his own imme|diate
approbation.</P>
<P>But Sir Hugh, notwith&s;tanding all Eugenia could
urge in favour of Melmond, had heard her account
with grief and re&s;entment. All, however, being ac|tually
ready for the double wedding, he could not, he
&s;aid, an&s;wer to his con&s;cience doing &s;o much for the
re&s;t, and refu&s;ing the &s;ame for Indiana, whom he
called upon to accept or reject the preparations made
for her cou&s;in.</P>
<P>Indiana &s;tood fluttering for a few minutes between
the exultation of being the fir&s;t bride, and the mor|tification
of marrying a man without fortune or title.
But the ob&s;ervation of Sir Hugh, upon the oddity
of her marrying the la&s;t, &s;he was piqued with a mo&s;t
earne&s;t ambition to rever&s;e. Nor did Melmond him|&s;elf
go for nothing in this affair, as all &s;he had of
heart he had been the fir&s;t to touch.</P>
<P>She retired for a &s;hort conference with Mi&s;s Mar|gland,
who was nearly in an equal dilemma, from
unwillingne&s;s to di&s;po&s;e of her beautiful pupil with|out
a title, and from eagerne&s;s to quit Cleves, which
<PB N="163" REF="164">
&s;he thought a convent for dullne&s;s, and a pri&s;on for
confinement. Melmond had &s;trongly in his favour
the received maxim among&s;t match-makers, that a
young lady without fortune has a le&s;s and le&s;s chance
of getting off upon every public appearance, which
they call a public failure: their joint deliberations
were, however, interrupted by an abrupt intiu&s;ion
of Molly Mill, who announced &s;he had ju&s;t heard
that Mi&s;s Dennel was going to be married.</P>
<P>This information ended the di&s;cu&s;&s;ion. The di&s;|grace
of a bridal appearance anticipated in the neigh|bourhood
by &s;uch a chit, made Indiana ha&s;tily run
down &s;tairs, and tell her uncle that the merit of Mel|mond
determined her to refu&s;e every body for his
&s;ake.</P>
<P>A man and hor&s;e, therefore, at break of day the
next morning, was &s;ent off by Eugenia to South|ampton
with the&s;e words:</P>
<LETTER>
<OPENER><HI>To</HI> FREDERIC MELMOND, <HI>E&s;&abque;</HI></OPENER>
<P>You will be welcome, Sir, at Cleves, where you
will forget, I hope, every painful &s;en&s;ation, in the
happine&s;s which awaits you, and di&s;mi&s;s all retro&s;pec|tion,
to return with &s;incerity the &s;erene friend&s;hip of</P>
<CLOSER><SIGNED>EUGENIA TYROLD.</SIGNED></CLOSER>
</LETTER>
<P>Mr. Tyrold now vi&s;ited Cleves with only his
younger daughter, and excu&s;ed the non-appearance
there, for the pre&s;ent, of Camilla; acknowledging
that &s;ome peculiar incidents, which he could not yet
explain, kept Mandlebert away, and mu&s;t po&s;tpone
the celebration of the marriage.</P>
<P>The vexation this gave Sir Hugh, redoubled his
anxiety to break to him the evil by degrees, if to
break it to him at all &s;hould become indi&s;pen&s;able.</P>

<HEAD>CHAP. XVIII.</HEAD>
<HEAD TYPE="sub">A Hint for Debtors.</HEAD>
<P>MR. Tyrold was well aware that to keep from
Sir Hugh the affliction of Camilla, he mu&s;t keep
from him Camilla her&s;elf: for though her &s;ighs &s;he
could &s;uppre&s;s, and her tears di&s;per&s;e, her voice
had lo&s;t its tone, her countenance its gaiety; her
eyes no longer &s;parkled, her very &s;miles betrayed
angui&s;h. He was the la&s;t to wonder at her &s;uffer|ings,
for Edgar was nearly as dear to him as her|&s;elf;
but he knew not, that, added to this annihi|lation
of happine&s;s, her peace was con&s;umed by
her &s;ecret knowledge of the blows yet impending
for him&s;elf, and for her uncle. Concealment, al|ways
abhorrent to her nature, had, till now, been
unknown even to her thoughts; and its weight,
from a &s;pecies of culpability that &s;eemed attached
to its practice, was, at times, more dreadful to
bear than the lo&s;s even of Edgar him&s;elf. The
latter blackened every pro&s;pect of felicity; but the
former, &s;till more tremendous to the pure princi|ples
in which &s;he had been educated, &s;eemed to
&s;trike even at her innocence. The fir&s;t wi&s;h of an
ingenuous mind is to anticipate even inquiry; the
feeling, therefore, that mo&s;t heavily weighs it
down, is any fear of detection.</P>
<P>While they were at breakfa&s;t the following
morning, the &s;ervant brought in the name of Dr.
Marchmont.</P>
<P>Camilla felt nearly fainting. Why he was come
&mdash;whence&mdash;whether Edgar accompanied him&mdash;or
&s;ent by him any me&s;&s;age&mdash;whether he were return|ed
to Beach Park&mdash;or &s;ailed for the Continent&mdash;&mdash;were
doubts that pre&s;&s;ed &s;o fa&s;t, and &s;o vehemently
upon her mind, that &s;he feared to quit the room
le&s;t &s;he &s;hould meet Edgar in the pa&s;&s;age, and
feared &s;till more to continue in it, le&s;t Dr. March|mont
<PB N="165" REF="166">
&s;hould enter without him. Mr. Tyrold,
who participated in all her feelings, and &s;hared
the &s;ame ideas, gently committed her to Lavinia,
and went into his &s;tudy to the Doctor.</P>
<P>His own illu&s;ion was there quickly de&s;troyed.
The looks of Dr. Marchmont boded nothing that
was happy. They wore not their cu&s;tomary ex|pre&s;&s;ion.
The gravity of Mr. Tyrold &s;hewed a
mind prepared for ill news, if not already oppre&s;&s;ed
with it, and the doctor, after a few general &s;peech|es,
delivered the letter from Edgar.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold received it with a &s;ecret &s;huddering;
&startq;Where,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;is Mandlebert at pre&s;ent?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;I believe, by this time&mdash;at the Hague.&endq;</P>
<P>This &s;entence, with the grieved, yet &s;till air
and tone of voice which accompanied it, was
death at once to every flattering hope: he immedi|ately
read the letter, which, conceived in the ten|dere&s;t
terms of reverence and affection, took a
&s;hort and &s;imple, though touchingly re&s;pectful
leave of the purpo&s;ed connexion, and demoli&s;hed
at once every di&s;tant view of future conciliation.</P>
<P>He hung his head a moment, and &s;ighed from
the bottom of his heart; but the re&s;ignation which
he &s;ummoned upon every &s;orrow was never deaf
to his call, and when he had &s;ecretly ejaculated a
&s;hort and &s;ilent prayer for fortitude to his beloved
wife, he turned calmy to the doctor, and began
conver&s;ing upon other affairs.</P>
<P>Dr. Marchmont pre&s;umed not to manife&s;t the
commi&s;eration with which he was filled. He &s;aw
the true chri&s;tian, enduring with humility mi&s;|fortune,
and the re&s;pectable parent &s;upporting the
dignity of his daughter by his own. To the fir&s;t
character, complaint was forbidden; to the &s;econd,
it would have been degrading. He looked at him
with veneration, but to &s;pare further u&s;ele&s;s and
painful efforts, &s;oon took leave.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, &s;haking hands with him, &s;aid, as
they were parting, &startq;when you write to Mandle|bert,
a&s;&s;ure him of my con&s;tant affection. The
<PB N="166" REF="167">
world, Dr. Marchmont is too full of real evil, for
me at lea&s;t, to cau&s;e one moment of unnece&s;&s;ary
unea&s;ine&s;s to any of its poor pilgrims. 'Tis &s;trange,
my dear doctor, this is not more generally con&s;i|dered,
&s;ince the advantage would be &s;o reciprocal
from man to man. But wrapt up in our own &s;hort
moment, we forget our neighbour's long hour!
and exi&s;tence is ultimately embittered to all, by
the refined &s;u&s;ceptibility for our&s;elves that mono|polizes
our feelings.&endq;</P>
<P>Doctor Marchmont, who in this la&s;t &s;entence
con&s;trued a &s;light reflection upon Edgar, expre&s;|&s;ively
an&s;wered, &startq;Our &s;en&s;ibility for others is not
always dormant, becau&s;e not apparent&mdash;How much
of worth and excellence may two characters &s;epa|rately
po&s;&s;e&s;s, where yet there are di&s;uniting
particles which impede their harmonizing with
each other!&endq;</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, powerfully &s;truck, &s;aw now the
general nature of the conceptions which had cau&s;ed
this lamented breach. He could not concur, but
he would not attempt to controvert: opinion in
this ca&s;e mu&s;t have even the precedence of ju&s;tice.
If Edgar thought his daughter of a di&s;po&s;ition with
which his own could not &s;ympathi&s;e, it were vain
to expatiate upon her virtues or her &s;weetne&s;s;
that one doubt previou&s;ly taken might mar their
a&s;&s;imilating efficacy. Comprehending, therefore,
the cau&s;e at large, he de&s;ired no detail; the words
of Dr. Marchmont, though deci&s;ive, were not of|fen&s;ive,
and yet they parted perfect friends, each
perceiving, yet forgiving, that each ca&s;t upon the
other the error of fal&s;e rea&s;oning; Edgar to the
one, and Camilla to the other, appearing faultle&s;s
in the &s;eparation.</P>
<P>But not in the ta&s;ks which &s;ucceeded were their
offices as ea&s;ily to be compared. Dr. Marchmont
wrote to Edgar that all was quietly relinqui&s;hed,
and his mea&s;ures were honourably acquitted; while
Mr. Tyrold, &s;hut up in his &s;tudy, &s;pent there &s;ome
of the &s;evere&s;t minutes of his life, in &s;truggling for
<PB N="167" REF="168">
the equanimity he covetted to pronounce to his
daughter this la&s;t doom. Pity for her &s;u&s;pence
accelerated his efforts, and he then &s;ent for her
down &s;tairs.</P>
<P>His utmo&s;t compo&s;ure, in &s;uch an interview,
was highly nece&s;&s;ary for both. The pale and
trembling Camilla advanced with downca&s;t eyes; but
when he took her in his arms, and ki&s;&s;ed her, a
&s;udden ray of hope &s;hot acro&s;s her quick imagina|tion,
and &s;he looked up: an in&s;tant was now &s;uffi|cient
to rectify her mi&s;take. The tenderne&s;s of
of her father wore no air of congratulation, it was
the mere offspring compa&s;&s;ion, and the woe with
which it was mixt, though mild, though patient,
was too potent to require words for explanation.</P>
<P>The glance &s;ufficed; her head dropt, her tears
in torrents bathed his bo&s;om; and &s;he retired to
Lavinia while yet neither of them had &s;poken.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold, contented with virtuous exertions,
demanded not impo&s;&s;ibilities; he left to nature
that fir&s;t grief which too early exhortation or con|troul
rather inflames than appea&s;es. He then
brought her back to his apartment.</P>
<P>He conjured her, there, to remember that &s;he
grieved not alone; that where the tears flowed not
&s;o fa&s;t from the eyes, the &s;ources were not dry
whence they &s;prung, and that bridled &s;orrow was
&s;ometimetimes the mo&s;t &s;uffering.</P>
<P>&startq;Alas, my deare&s;t father, to think you mourn
too&mdash;and for me!&mdash;will that le&s;&s;en what I feel?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;Yes, my dear child, by a generous duty it
will point out to watch that the exce&s;s of one
affliction involve you not in another.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;What a motive,&endq; &s;he an&s;wered, &startq;for exer|tion!
If the &s;malle&s;t part of your happine&s;s&mdash;of
my honoured mother's&mdash;depends upon mine, I
&s;hall be unhappy, I think, no more!&endq;</P>
<P>A gu&s;h of tears ill accorded with this fond decla|ration;
but Mr. Tyrold, without noticing them,
kindly replied, &startq;Let your filial affection, my
child, check the inordinacy of your affliction,
<PB N="168" REF="169">
and I will accept with plea&s;ure for your virtuous
mother, and with thanks for my&s;elf, the exertion
which, beginning for our &s;akes, may lead you to
that &s;elf denial which is the parent of our be&s;t hu|man
actions, and approximates us the mo&s;t to what
what is divine.&endq;</P>
<P>Broken-hearted as was Camilla, her &s;orrows
would, at lea&s;t apparently, have abated from con|&s;olation
&s;o tender, if all &s;he felt had been known;
if no latent and lurking evil had hung upon her
&s;pirits, defeating all argument, and blighting all
comfort, by the cruel con&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s of concealed
mi&s;chief, which while ince&s;&s;antly &s;he &s;tudied the
be&s;t moment for revealing, accident might prema|turely
betray.</P>
<P>Upon this &s;ubject her thoughts were unremit|tingly
bent, till, in a few days time, &s;he received
a letter from Mrs. Mittin, informing her &s;he had
ju&s;t &s;een the money-lender, Mr. Clykes, who,
finding her &s;o much under age, would not under|take
the bu&s;ine&s;s for le&s;s than ten per cent, nor
without a free premium of at lea&s;t twenty pounds.</P>
<P>The latter demand, &s;o entirely out of her power
to grant, gave to her the mental &s;trength &s;he had
yet &s;ought in vain; and determining to end this
baneful &s;ecret, &s;he &s;eized her own fir&s;t moment of
emotion to relate to her father the whole of her
di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and ca&s;t her&s;elf upon his mercy.</P>
<P>I &s;hall be happier, &s;he cried, much happier, as,
with tottering &s;teps, &s;he hurried to the &s;tudy; he
will be lenient, I know; and even if not, what
di&s;plea&s;ure can I incur &s;o &s;evere as the eternal ap|prehen&s;ion
of doing wrong?</P>
<P>But her plan though well formed, had fixed upon
an ill-timed moment for its execution. She en|tered
the room with an agitation which rather
&s;ought than &s;hunned remark, that &s;ome enquiry
might make an opening for her confe&s;&s;ion: but Mr.
Tyrold was intently reading a letter, and examin|ing
&s;ome papers, from which he rai&s;ed not his eyes
at her approach. She &s;tood fearfully before him
<PB N="169" REF="170">
till he had done; but then, &s;till not looking up,
he leant his head upon his hand, with a counte|nance
&s;o di&s;turbed, that, alarmed from her de&s;ign,
by the apprehen&s;ion he had received &s;ome ill tidings
from Li&s;bon, &s;he a&s;ked, in a faint voice, if the
foreign po&s;t were come in?</P>
<P>&startq;I hope not!&endq; he an&s;wered: &startq;I &s;hould look
with pain, at this moment, upon the hand of your
unhappy mother!&endq;</P>
<P>Camilla, affrighted, knew not now what con|jecture;
but gliding into her pocket the letter of
Mrs. Mittin, &s;tood &s;u&s;pended from her purpo&s;e.</P>
<P>&startq;What &amacr; reception,&endq; he pre&s;ently added, &startq;is
preparing for that noble&s;t of women when her
exile may end! That epoch, to which I have
looked forward as the brightener of my every
view upon earth&mdash;how is it now clouded!&endq;</P>
<P>Giving her, then, the letter and papers; &startq;The
&s;on,&endq; he &s;aid, &startq;who once I had hoped would
prove the guardian of his &s;i&s;ters, the honour of
his mother's days, the future prop of my own&mdash;See,
Camilla, on how &s;andy a foundation mortal
man builds mortal hopes!&endq;</P>
<P>The letter was from a very re&s;pectable trade&s;man,
containing a complaint that, for the three years Lio|nel
had been at the Univer&s;ity, he had never paid
one bill, though he continually ordered new articles:
and begging Mr. Tyrold would have the goodne&s;s
to &s;ettle the accounts he enclo&s;ed; the young gen|tleman,
after fixing a day for payment, having
&s;uddenly ab&s;conded without notice to any one.</P>
<P>&startq;The &s;um, you &s;ee,&endq; continued Mr. Tyrold,
&startq;amounts to one hundred and &s;eventy-one pounds;
a &s;um, for my income enormous. The allowance
I made this cruel boy, was not only adequate to
all his proper wants, and rea&s;onable de&s;ires, but
all I could afford without di&s;tre&s;&s;ing my&s;elf, or in|juring
my other children: yet it has &s;erved him,
I imagine, but for pocket money! The im|men&s;e
&s;ums he has extorted from both his uncles,
mu&s;t have been &s;wallowed up at a gaming table.
<PB N="170" REF="171">
Into what wretched cour&s;es has he run! The&s;e
bills, large as they are, I regard but as forerunners
of others; all he has received he has &s;quan|dered
upon his vices, and to-morrow, and the
next day, and the next, I may expect an encrea&s;|ing
li&s;t of his debts, from his hatter, his ho&s;ier,
his &s;hoe-maker, his taylor,&mdash;and whoever he has
employed.</P>
<P>Camilla, overwhelmed with internal &s;hame, yet
more powerful than grief it&s;elf, &s;tood motionle&s;s.
The&s;e expences appeared but like a &s;econd part of
her own, with her milliner, her jeweller, and her
haberda&s;her; which now &s;eemed to her&s;elf not le&s;s
wanton in extravagance.</P>
<P>Surpri&s;ed by her entire &s;ilence, Mr. Tyrold
looked up. Her cheeks, rather livid than pale,
and the deep di&s;may of her countenance, extremely
affected him. The kindne&s;s of his embraces re|lieved
her by melting her into tears, though the
&s;peech which accompanied them was, to her con|&s;ciou&s;ne&s;s,
but reproach: &startq;Let not your &s;i&s;terly
feelings thus &s;ubdue you, my deare&s;t Camilla. Be
comforted that you have given us no affliction
your&s;elf, &s;ave what we mu&s;t feel for your own un|de&s;ervedly
altered pro&s;pects. No unthinking im|prudence,
no unfeeling &s;elfi&s;hne&s;s, has ever, $or an
in&s;tant, driven from your thoughts what you owe
to your duty, or weakened your plea&s;ure in every
endearing filial tie. Let this chear you, my child;
and let us all try to &s;ubmit calmly to our general
di&s;appointment.&endq;</P>
<P>Prai&s;e thus ill-timed rather probed than healed her
wounds. Am I puni&s;hed? am I puni&s;hed? She inter|nally
exclaimed; but could not bear to meet the eyes
of her father, who&s;e indulgence &s;he felt as if abu&s;ing,
and who&s;e good opinion &s;eemed now but a delu|&s;ion.
Again, he made her over to the gentle
Lavinia for comfort, and fearing &s;erious ill effects
from added mi&s;ery, exerted him&s;elf, from this time,
to appear chearful when &s;he was pre&s;ent.</P>
<P><PB N="171" REF="172">
His predictions failed not to be fulfilled: the ap|plication
made by one creditor, &s;oon reached every
other, and urged &s;imilar mea&s;ures. Bills there|fore,
came in daily, with petitions for payment;
and as Lionel &s;till wanted a month or two of being
of age, his creditors depended with confidence upon
the re&s;pon&s;ibility of his father.</P>
<P>Nor here clo&s;ed the claims &s;pringing from
general ill conduct. Two young men of fa&s;hion,
hard pre&s;&s;ed for their own failures, &s;tated to Mr.
Tyrold the debts of honour owing them from
Lionel: and three notorious game&s;ters, who had
drawn in the unthinking youth to his ruin, en|forced
the &s;ame information, with a hint that, if
they were left un&s;atisfied, the credit of the young
man would fall the &s;acrifice of their ill treatment.</P>
<P>The ab&s;ence of Mrs. Tyrold at this period, by
&s;paring her daily difficulty as well as pain, was re|joiced
in by her hu&s;band; though never &s;o &s;trongly
had he wanted her aiding coun&s;el, her equal in|tere&s;t,
and her con&s;oling participation. Obliged
to act without them, his deliberation was &s;hort and
deci&s;ive for his mea&s;ures, but long and painful for
their means of execution. He at once determined
to pay, though for the la&s;t time, all the trades
people; but the manner of obtaining the money
required more con&s;ideration.</P>
<P>The bills, when all collected, amounted to &s;ome|thing
above five hundred pounds, which was but one
hundred &s;hort of his full yearly income.</P>
<P>Of this, he had always contrived to lay by an hun|dred
pounds annually, which &s;um, with its accumu|lating
intere&s;t, was de&s;tined to be divided between
Lavinia and Camilla. Eugenia required nothing; and
Lionel was to inherit the paternal little fortune. The
portion of Mrs. Tyrold, which was &s;mall, the e&s;tate
of her father having been almo&s;t all entailed upon
Mr. Relvil, was to be divided equally among&s;t her
children.</P>
<P>To take from the little hoard which, with &s;o ten|der
a care, he had heaped for the daughters, &s;o large
<PB N="172" REF="173">
a &s;hare for the &s;on, and to an&s;wer demands &s;o unduly
rai&s;ed, and ill de&s;erved, was repul&s;ive to his inclina|tion,
and &s;hocked his &s;trong &s;en&s;e of equal ju&s;tice.
To apply to Mr. Relvil would be prepo&s;terous; for
though upon him dwelt all his ultimate hopes for
Lionel, he knew him, at this moment, to be &s;o
&s;uffering and &s;o irritated by his means, that to hear of
any new mi&s;demeanours might incen&s;e him to an irre|vocable
di&s;inheritance.</P>
<P>With regard to Sir Hugh, nothing was too much
to expect from his generous kindne&s;s; yet he knew
that his bountiful heart had always kept his income
from overflowing; and that, for three years pa&s;t,
Lionel had drained it without mercy. His prepara|tions,
al&s;o, for the double marriages had, of late,
much &s;traitened him. To take up even the &s;malle&s;t
part of what, in le&s;s expen&s;ive times, he had laid by,
he would regard as a breach of his &s;olemn vow, by
which he imagined him&s;elf bound to leave Eugenia
the full property &s;he would have po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, had he
died in&s;tantly upon making it. Rea&s;on might have
&s;hewn this a tie of &s;upererogation; but where any man
conceived him&s;elf obeying the dictates of his con&s;ci|ence,
Mr. Tyrold held his motives too &s;acred for
di&s;pute.</P>
<P>The painful re&s;ult of this afflicting meditation, was
laying before his daughters the whole of his difficul|ties,
and demanding if they would willingly concur
in paying their brother's bills from their appropriate
little &s;tore, by adopting an altered plan of life, and
&s;evere &s;elf-denial of their pre&s;ent ea&s;e and elegance,
to aid its &s;peedy replacement.</P>
<P>Their &s;atisfaction in any expedient to &s;erve their
brother that &s;eemed to fall upon them&s;elves, was &s;in|cere,
was even joyful: but they jointly be&s;ought
that the &s;um might be freely taken up, and deducted
for ever more from the hoard; &s;ince no earthly grati|fication
could be &s;o great to them, as contributing their
mite to prevent any deprivation of dome&s;tic enjoy|ment
to their beloved parents.</P>
<P><PB N="173" REF="174">
His eyes gli&s;tened, but not from grief; it was the
plea&s;ure of virtuous happine&s;s in their purity of filial
affection. But though he knew their &s;incerity, he
would not li&s;ten to their petition. &startq;You are not
yet,&endq; &s;aid he, &startq;aware what your future calls may be
for money. What I have yet been able to &s;ave,
without this unexpected &s;eizure, would be inadequate
to your even decent maintenance, &s;hould any accident
&s;top &s;hort its encrea&s;e. Weep not, my dear children!
my health is &s;till good, and my pro&s;pect of lengthened
life &s;eems fair. It would be, however, a temporal
folly as well as a &s;piritual pre&s;umption, to forget the
precarious tenure of human exi&s;tence. My life, my
dear girls, will he happier, without being &s;horter,
for making provi&s;ions for its worldly ce&s;&s;ation.&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;But, Sir! but my father!&endq; cried Camilla|hanging
over him, and lo&s;ing in filial tenderne&s;s her
per&s;onal di&s;tre&s;&s;es; &startq;if your manner of living is
altered, and my dear mother returns home and &s;ees
you relinqui&s;hing any of your &s;mall, your temperate
indulgencies, may it not yet more embitter her &s;ufferings
and her di&s;plea&s;ure for the unhappy cau&s;e? For her
&s;ake then, if not for ours.&endq;&mdash;</P>
<P>&startq;Do not turn away, deare&s;t Sir!&endq; cried Lavinia;
&startq;what mother ever merited to have her peace the fir&s;t
&s;tudy of her children, if it is not ours?&endq;</P>
<P>&startq;O Providence benign!&endq; &s;aid Mr. Tyrold, fold|ing
them to his heart, &startq;how am I yet ble&s;&s;ed in my
children!&mdash;True and excellent daughters of my in|valuable
wife&mdash;This little narration is the &s;olace I
&s;hall have to offer for the grief I mu&s;t communicate.&endq;</P>
<P>He would not, however, hearken to their propo&s;i|tion;
his peace, he &s;aid, required not only immediate
mea&s;ures for replacing what he mu&s;t borrow, but al&s;o
that no cha&s;m &s;hould have lieu in funding his u&s;ual
annual &s;um for them. All he would accept was the
&s;ame &s;evere forbearance he &s;hould in&s;tantly practice
him&s;elf, and which their mother, when re&s;tored to
them, would be the fir&s;t to adopt and improve. And
this, till its end was an&s;wered, they would all &s;teadily
<PB N="174" REF="175">
continue, and then, with chearful &s;elf-approvance,
re&s;um$ their wonted comforts.</P>
<P>Mr. Tyrold had too frequent views of the brevity
of human life to po&s;tpone, even from one &s;un to ano|ther,
any action he deemed e&s;&s;ential. A new general
&s;y&s;tem, therefore, immediately pervaded his hou&s;e.
Two of the &s;ervants, with whom he be&s;t could di&s;|p$n&s;$,
were di&s;charged; which hurt him m$re than
any other privation, $or he loved, and was loved by
every dome&s;tic who lived with him. His table, al|ways
&s;imple though elegant, was now reduced to plain
nece&s;&s;aries; he parted with every hor&s;e, but one to
who&s;e long &s;ervices he held him&s;elf a debtor; and
whatever, throughout the whole oeconomy of his &s;mall
e&s;tabli&s;hment, admitted &s;implifying, deducting, or
aboli&s;hment, received without delay, its requi&s;ite
alteration or di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>The&s;e new regulations were quietly, but complete|ly,
put in practice, before he would di&s;charge one bill
for his &s;on; to whom, neverthele&s;s, though his con|duct
was &s;trict, his feelings were &s;till lenient. He
attributed not to moral turpitude his errors nor his
crimes, but to the prevalence of ill example, and to
an unju&s;tifiable and dangerous levity, which irre&s;i&s;ta|bly
led him to treat with mockery and trifling the mo&s;t
&s;erious &s;ubjects. The puni&s;hment, however, which
he had now drawn upon him&s;elf would yet, he hoped,
touch his heart.</P>
<P>But the debts called debts of honour, met not with
&s;imilar treatment. He an&s;wered with &s;pirited re&s;ent|ment
demands he deemed highly flagitious, coun&s;elling
tho&s;e who &s;ent them, when next they applied to an un|happy
family to who&s;e calamities they had contribut|ed,
to enquire fir&s;t if its principles, as well as its
fortune, made the hazards of gaming among&s;t its do|me&s;tic
re&s;pon&s;ibilities.</P>
