<OPENER><SALUTE>MADAM,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>_TO Your Maje&s;ty is mo&s;t humbly De|dicated this Second Part of the <HI>Hi&s;tory of the Rebellion and Civil Wars,</HI> written by <HI>Edward</HI> Earl of <HI>Clarendon.</HI> For to whom &s;o naturally can the works of this Author, treating of the times of Your
<PB REF="70">
Royal Grandfather, be addre&s;s'd, as to Your &s;elf; now wearing, with Lu&s;tre and Glory, that Crown, which, in tho&s;e unhappy days, was treated with &s;o much contempt and barbarity, and laid low even to the Du&s;t?</P>
<P>This Second Part comes with the greater confidence into Your pre&s;ence, by the advantage of the favourable reception, the Fir&s;t hath met with in the World; &s;ince it is not to be doubted, but the &s;ame truth, fairne&s;s, and impartiality, that will be found through|out the whole thread of the Hi&s;tory, will meet with the &s;ame Can|dour from all equal Judges.</P>
<P>'Tis true, &s;ome few Per&s;ons, who&s;e Ance&s;tors are here found not to have had that part during their lives which would have been more agreeable to the wi&s;hes of their &s;urviving po&s;terity, have been offended at &s;ome particulars, mention'd in this Hi&s;tory, con|cerning &s;o near Relations, and would have them pa&s;s for mi&s;taken Informations. But it is to be hoped, that &s;uch a concern of Kindred for their Families, though not blameable in them, will rather ap|pear partial on Their &s;ide; &s;ince it cannot be doubted, but this Author mu&s;t have had his materials from undeniable, and unex|ceptionable hands, and could have no temptation to in&s;ert any thing but the truth in a work of this nature, which was de&s;ign'd to remain to Po&s;terity, as a faithful record of Things and Per&s;ons in tho&s;e times, and of his own unque&s;tionable &s;incerity in the re|pre&s;entation of them.</P>
<P>In this a&s;&s;urance it is humbly hoped, it will not be unprofitable to Your Maje&s;ty to be here inform'd of the fatal and unde&s;erv'd misfortunes of one of Your Ance&s;tors, with the particular and &s;ad occa&s;ions of them; the better to direct Your Royal Per&s;on through the continual uncertainties of the Greatne&s;s of this World. And as Your Maje&s;ty cannot have a better Guide, throughout the whole Cour&s;e of Your Reign, for the good Admini&s;tration of Your Govern|ment,
<PB REF="80">
than Hi&s;tory in general, &s;o there cannot be a more u&s;eful one to Your Maje&s;ty than this of Your own Kingdoms; and it is pre|&s;um'd, without lying under the Imputation of mi&s;leading Your Ma|je&s;ty, it may be a&s;&s;erted that no Author could have been better in|&s;tructed, and have known more of the times and matters of which he writes, than this who is here pre&s;ented to You.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty may depend upon his Relations to be true in fact; and You will find his ob&s;ervations ju&s;t; his Reflections made with judgement and weight; and his Advices given upon wi&s;e and ho|ne&s;t principles; not capable of being now interpreted as &s;ub&s;ervient to any Ambition or Intere&s;t of his own; and having now outliv'd the prejudices and partialities of the times in which they were written. And Your Maje&s;ty thus elevated, as by God's ble&s;&s;ing You are, from whom a great many truths may be indu&s;triou&s;ly conceal'd, and on whom a great many wrong notions under fal&s;e Colours may with equal care be obtruded, will have the greater advantage from this faithful Remembrancer.</P>
<P>This Author, once a Privy Coun&s;ellor and Mini&s;ter to two great Kings, and, in a good degree, Favourite to one of them, hath &s;ome pretence to be admitted into Your Maje&s;ties Council too, and may become capable of doing You Service al&s;o; whil&s;t the accounts he gives of times pa&s;t, come &s;ea&s;onably to guide You through the times pre&s;ent, and tho&s;e to come.</P>
<P>This History may lie upon Your Table unenvied, and Your Ma|jesty may pa&s;s hours and days in the peru&s;al of it, when po&s;&s;ibly, they who &s;hall be the most u&s;eful in Your Service, may be reflected on for aiming too much at influencing Your Actions, and engro&s;&s;ing Your Time.</P>
<P>From this History Your Majesty may come to know more of the nature, and temper of Your own People, than hath yet been ob|&s;erv'd by any other hand. Neither can any living conver&s;ation lay
<PB REF="90">
before Your Maje&s;ty in one view, &s;o many tran&s;actions nece&s;&s;ary for Your ob&s;ervation. And &s;eeing no Prince can be endued in a moment with a perfect experience in the conduct of Affairs, what|ever knowledge may be u&s;eful to Your Maje&s;ties Government, if it may have been concealed from You in the Circum&s;tances of Your private Life, in this Hi&s;tory it may be the mo&s;t effectually &s;up|plied; where Your Maje&s;ty will find the true constitution of Your Government, both in Church and State, plainly laid before You, as well as the Mi&s;takes that were committed in the management of both.</P>
<P>Here Your Maje&s;ty will &s;ee how both tho&s;e Intere&s;ts are in&s;e|perable, and ought to be pre&s;erv'd &s;o, and how fatal it hath prov'd to both, whenever, by the Artifice and Malice of wicked and &s;elf|de&s;igning Men, they have happen'd to be divided. And though Your Maje&s;ty will &s;ee here, how a great King lost his Kingdoms, and at last his Life, in the Defence of this Church, You will di&s;cern too, that it was by Men, who were no better friends to Monarchy than to true Religion, that his Calamities were brought upon him; and as it was the method of tho&s;e Men to take excep|tions first to the Ceremonies and outward Order of the Church, that they might attack her the more &s;urely in her very Being and Foundation, &s;o they could not destroy the State, which they chiefly de&s;ign'd, 'till they had first overturn'd the Church. And a truth it is which cannot be controverted, That the Monarchy of <HI>England</HI> is not now capable of being Supported, but upon the Principles of the Church of <HI>England;</HI> from whence it will be very natural to conclude, that the pre&s;erving them both firmly united together is the likeliest way, for Your Majesty to Reign happily over Your Subjects.</P>
<P>The Religion by Law Establi&s;hed is &s;uch a Vital part of the Government, &s;o con&s;tantly woven and mixed into every branch of it,
<PB REF="100">
that generally Men look upon it as a good part of their Property too; &s;ince that, and the Government of the Church is &s;ecured to them by the &s;ame provi&s;ion. So that it &s;eems that, next to Trea&s;on again&s;t Your Sacred Per&s;on, an Inva&s;ion upon the Church ought to be watched and prevented by tho&s;e who have the honour to be tru&s;ted in the publick Admini&s;tration, with the &s;tricte&s;t Care and Diligence, as the be&s;t way to pre&s;erve Your Per&s;on and Government in their ju&s;t dignity and authority.</P>
<P>Amongst all the ob&s;ervations, that may be made out of this History, there &s;eems none more Melancholick, than that, after &s;o much mi&s;ery and de&s;olation brought upon the&s;e Kingdoms by that unnatural Civil War, which hath yet left &s;o many deep and lamentable marks of it's rage and fury, there have hitherto ap|pear'd &s;o few &s;igns of repentance and reformation.</P>
<P>Some Per&s;ons will &s;ee, they are de&s;ign'd to be excepted out of this remark, who&s;e conduct hath happily made amends for the mistakes of their Ancestors, and who&s;e practice in the Stations they are now in, does &s;ufficiently distingui&s;h them. Happy were it for the Nation, had all the rest thought fit to follow &s;o good Examples, and that either Acts of Indemnity and Oblivion, or Acts of Grace and Favour, or Employments of Authority, Riches, and Honour, had hitherto been able to recover many of them to the temper of good Subjects. The truth of this ob&s;er|vation is &s;et forth by this Author in &s;o lively a manner, that one hath frequent occa&s;ions to look on him as a Prophet as well as an Historian, in &s;everal particulars mention'd in this Book.</P>
<P>That this Remark may not look froward or angry, with great &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to Your Majesty, it may be con&s;ider'd, what can be the meaning of the &s;everal Seminaries, and as it were Univer&s;i|ties, &s;et up in divers parts of the Kingdom, by more than ordi|nary
<PB REF="110">
Indu&s;try, contrary to Law, &s;upported by large contribu|tions; where the Youth is bred up in Principles directly contrary to Monarchical and Epi&s;copal Government? what can be the meaning of the con&s;tant Solemnizing by &s;ome Men, the Anniver|&s;ary of that di&s;mal thirtieth of <HI>January,</HI> in &s;candalous and op|probrious feasting and jesting, which the Law of the Land hath commanded to be perpetually ob&s;erv'd in fa&s;ting and humiliation? If no &s;ober Man can &s;ay any thing in the defence of &s;uch Actions, &s;o destructive to the very E&s;&s;ence of the Government, and yet im|po&s;&s;ible to be conducted without much con&s;ultation and advice, it is hoped this reflection will not be thought to have proceeded from an uncharitable and ill natur'd &s;pirit, but from a dutiful and tender regard to the good of the Nation, and the pro&s;perity of Your Maje&s;ties Reign.</P>
<P>In the mean time, whether this does not look like an indu&s;trious Propagation of the Rebellious Principles of the la&s;t Age, and on that &s;core render it nece&s;&s;ary that Your Maje&s;ty &s;hould have an eye toward &s;uch unaccountable Proceedings, is humbly &s;ubmitted to Your Maje&s;ty; who will make a better judgement upon the whole than any others can &s;ugge&s;t to You: You have a greater Intere&s;t to do it; You have much more to pre&s;erve, and much more to lo&s;e; You have the happine&s;s of Your Kingdoms, Your Crown, and Your Government to &s;ecure, in a time of as great difficulties, as ever were yet known, under a very Expen&s;ive War at pre&s;ent, and &s;ome circum&s;tances attending it in relation to the&s;e Nations, that may continue even after a Peace; be&s;ides the dan|ger of a future &s;eparation of the two Kingdoms, very uncomfort|able to reflect on; which yet, in all probability, will have Influence upon the pre&s;ent times too, if it comes once to be thought that it is inevitable.</P>
<P>God give Your Maje&s;ty a &s;afe and pro&s;perous pa&s;&s;age through
<PB REF="120">
&s;o many appearances of hazard; You can never want Under|takers of divers &s;orts, who, according to their &s;everal Politicks, will warrant You Succe&s;s if You will tru&s;t 'em: But Your real happine&s;s will very much depend upon Your &s;elf, and Your choo&s;ing to Honour with Your Service &s;uch Per&s;ons as are hone&s;t, stout&punc; and wi&s;e.</P>
<P>If Informations of times pa&s;t may be u&s;eful, this Author will de&s;erve a &s;hare of credit with You, who&s;e reputation and expe|rience were &s;o great in his life time, that they will be recorded in times to come for the real Services he did, be&s;ides the Honour, and great Fortune, unu&s;ual to a Subject, of having $$en Grandfa|ther to two great Queens, Your Royal Si&s;ter and Your Self; both &s;o well belov'd, and e&s;teem'd by Your People; both &s;o willing, and zealous to do good. Her power indeed was more limited and de|pendent; but her early death made room for Your Maje&s;ties more unre&s;train'd and Soveraign Authority, and re&s;ign'd to Your &s;elf alone the more la&s;ting di&s;pen&s;ation of tho&s;e ble&s;&s;ings that came from Heaven to You both.</P>
<P>If the benefit Your Maje&s;ty may reap by the peru&s;al of this Hi&s;tory, &s;hall prove &s;erviceable to after times, it will be remem|ber'd to the prai&s;e and honour of his name; and Your Maje&s;ty Your &s;elf will not be di&s;plea&s;ed to allow his memory a &s;hare of that advantage; nor be offended with being put in mind, that Your <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Heart, &s;o happily own'd by Your &s;elf, and adored by Your Subjects, had not been &s;o <HI>Entirely Engli&s;h,</HI> without a communication with His heart too, than which there never was one more devoted to the good of his Country and the firm e&s;ta|bli&s;hment of the Crown.</P>
<P>It being de&s;ign'd by this Dedication only to introduce this No|ble Author into Your pre&s;ence, it would be contrary to the Inten|tion of it to take up more of Your Maje&s;ties time here; it is be&s;t
<PB REF="130">
therefore to leave this faithful Coun&s;ellor alone with You. For God's &s;ake, Madam, and Your own, be plea&s;ed to read him with attention, and &s;erious and frequent reflections; and from thence, in conjunction with Your own Heart, pre&s;cribe to Your &s;elf the methods of true and la&s;ting Greatne&s;s, and the &s;olid Maxims of a Soveraign truly <HI>Engli&s;h:</HI> That during this life, You may ex|ceed in Felicities and Fame, and after this life, in Reputation and E&s;teem, that Glorious Predece&s;&s;or of Your Maje&s;ties, the Renown'd Fir&s;t <HI>Semper Eadem,</HI> who&s;e Motto You have cho&s;en, and who&s;e Pattern You &s;eem to have taken for Your great Ex|ample, to Your own immortal Glory, and the Defence, Security, and Pro&s;perity of the Kingdoms You govern.</P>

So that they who were not over much given to fear, finding very many places in that great River, which was looked upon as the only &s;trength and &s;ecurity of the Town, to be ea&s;ily forda|ble, <MILESTONE N="20"> and nothing towards an Army for defence but the Standard &s;et up, begun &s;adly to apprehend the danger of the Kings own Per&s;on. <Q>In&s;o|much that S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hley,</HI> his Serjeant-Major-General of his intended Army, told him, &startq;that he could not give any a&s;&s;urance again&s;t his Ma|je&s;ties
<PB N="2" REF="170">
being taken out of his bed, if the Rebels &s;hould make a brisk&endq; attempt to that purpo&s;e.</Q> And it was evident, all the Strength he had to depend upon was his Hor&s;e, which were under the Command of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> at <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and were not at that time in Number above eight hundred, few better arm'd than with Swords; whil&s;t the Enemy had, within le&s;s than twenty Miles of that place, double the Number of Hor&s;e excellently arm'd and appointed, and a Body of five thou&s;and Foot well train'd, and di&s;ciplin'd; &s;o that, no doubt, if they had ad|vanced, they might at lea&s;t have di&s;per&s;ed tho&s;e few Troops of the Kings, and driven his Maje&s;ty to a greater di&s;tance, and expo&s;ed him to nota|ble <MILESTONE N="10"> hazards and inconveniencies.</P>
<P>WHEN Men were allmo&s;t confounded with this pro&s;pect, his Ma|je&s;ty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Port&s;mouth <HI>be &s;ieg'd by the Parliaments Forces.</HI></NOTE> receiv'd Intelligence, that <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> was &s;o &s;treightly be&s;ieged by Sea and Land, that it would be reduced in very few days, except it were reliev'd. For the truth is, Colonel <HI>Goring,</HI> though he had &s;ufficient warning, and &s;ufficient &s;upplies of Money to put that place into a po|&s;ture, had relied too much upon probable and ca&s;ual a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and neglected to do that Him&s;elf which a vigilant Officer would have done: and albeit his chief dependence was both for money and provi&s;ions from the I&s;le of <HI>Wight,</HI> yet he was carele&s;s to &s;ecure tho&s;e &s;mall Ca&s;tles and <MILESTONE N="20"> Block-hou&s;es, that guarded the pa&s;&s;age; which, revolting to the Parlia|ment a&s;&s;oon as he declared for the King, cut off all tho&s;e dependences; &s;o that he had neither Men enough to do ordinary duty, nor provi&s;ions enough for tho&s;e few, for any con&s;iderable time. And at the &s;ame time with this news of <HI>Port&s;mouth,</HI> arrived certain Adverti&s;ements, that the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> and all his Forces in the We&s;t, from whom only the King hoped that <HI>Port&s;mouth</HI> &s;hould be reliev'd, was driven out of <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> where his power and intere&s;t was believ'd un|que&s;tionable, into <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire;</HI> and there be&s;ieged in <HI>Sherborne</HI> Ca&s;tle.</P>
<P>THE Marquis, after he left the King at <HI>Beverly,</HI> by ordinary jour|neys, <MILESTONE N="30"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Hertford<HI>'s Actions in</HI> Somer&s;et-&s;hire, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></NOTE> and without making any long &s;tay by the way, came to <HI>Bath,</HI> upon the very edge of <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> at the time when the General A&s;|&s;izes were there held; where, meeting all the con&s;iderable Gentlemen of that great County, and finding them well affected to the King's Ser|vice, except very few who were &s;ufficiently known, he enter'd into con|&s;ultation with them from whom he was to expect a&s;&s;i&s;tance, in what place he &s;hould mo&s;t conveniently fix him&s;elf for the better di&s;po&s;ing the Affections of the People, and to rai&s;e a &s;trength for the re&s;i&s;tance of any attempt which the Parliament might make, either again&s;t them, or to di&s;turb the Peace of the Country by their Ordinance of the Militia, <MILESTONE N="40"> which was the fir&s;t power they were like to hear of. <Q>Some were of opi|nion, &startq;that <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> would be the fitte&s;t place, being a great, rich, and populous City; of which being once po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed, they &s;hould be ea&s;ily able to give the Law to <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter-&s;hire;</HI> and could not receive any Affront by a &s;uddain or tumultuary In&s;urrection of the&endq; People.</Q> And if this advice had been followed, it would, probably, have proved very pro&s;perous. <Q>But, on the contrary, it was objected, &startq;that it was not evident, that his Lord&s;hips reception into the City would be &s;uch as was expected; M^r <HI>Hollis</HI> being Lieutenant thereof, and having exerci&s;ed the Militia there; and there being vi&s;ibly many <MILESTONE N="50"> di&s;affected people in it, and &s;ome of Eminent Quality; and if he &s;hould attempt to go thither and be di&s;appointed, it would break the whole De&s;ign: Then that it was out of the County of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and therefore

<P>WHEN the Marquis was thus in the mid&s;t of an Enemy that allmo&s;t cover'd the whole Kingdom, his whole &s;trength was a Troop of Hor&s;e, rai&s;ed by M^r <HI>John Digby,</HI> Son to the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and another by S^r <HI>Francis Hawley</HI> (both which were levied in tho&s;e parts to attend the King in the North) and a Troop of Hor&s;e and a &s;mall Troop of Dra|goons, rai&s;ed and armed by S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> at his own charge; and about one hundred Foot gathered up by Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Henry Lunsford</HI> towards a Regiment, which were likewi&s;e to have marched <MILESTONE N="20"> to the King.

And thereupon your Maje&s;ty hath &s;et up your Stan|dard again&s;t them, whereby you have put the two Hou&s;es of Parlia|ment, and, in Them, this whole Kingdom, out of your Protection; &s;o that until your Maje&s;ty &s;hall recal tho&s;e Proclamations and Decla|rations, whereby the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and both Hou&s;e$ of Parliament, and their Adherents, and A&s;&s;i&s;tants, and &s;uch as have obeyed and exe|cuted <MILESTONE N="20"> their Commands and Directions, according to their duties, are declared Traitors or otherwi&s;e Delinquents: and until the Standard, &s;et up in pur&s;uance of the &s;aid Proclamation, be taken down, your Maje&s;ty hath put us into &s;uch a condition, that whil&s;t we &s;o remain, we cannot, by the fundamental Priviledges of Parliament, the publick tru&s;t repo&s;ed in us, or with the general good and &s;afety of this King|dom,&endq; give your Maje&s;ty any other An&s;wer to this Me&s;&s;age.</Q></P>

<P>WHEN the King's Me&s;&s;engers return'd with this An&s;wer to <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> all Men &s;aw to what they mu&s;t tru&s;t; and the King believ'd, <MILESTONE N="30"> he &s;hould be no farther moved to make Addre&s;&s;es to them. And yet all hopes of an Army, or any ability to re&s;i&s;t that violence &s;eem'd &s;o de&s;perate, that he was privately advi&s;ed by &s;ome&punc; whom he tru&s;ted as much as any, and tho&s;e who&s;e affections were as entire to him as any Mens, to give all other thoughts over, and in&s;tantly to make all ima|ginable ha&s;t to <HI>London,</HI> and to appear in the Parliament Hou&s;e before they had any expectation of him. And they conceived there would be more likelyhood for him to prevail that way, than by any Army he was like to rai&s;e.

<P>AND le&s;t this Overture of a Treaty might be a means to allay and compo&s;e the di&s;tempers of the People, and that the hope and expecta|tion <MILESTONE N="10"> of Peace might not di&s;hearten their Party, in their preparations and contributions to the War, the &s;ame day they &s;ent their la&s;t An&s;wer to the King, they publi&s;hed this Declaration to the Kingdom.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;WHEREAS his Maje&s;ty, in a Me&s;&s;age receiv'd the 5^t^h of <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Hou&s;es De|claration to the Kingdom.</NOTE> requires that the Parliament would revoke their Declarations again&s;t &s;uch Per&s;ons, as have a&s;&s;i&s;ted his Maje&s;ty in this unnatural War again&s;t his Kingdom; it is this day ordered, and declared by the Lords and Commons, that the Armes, which they have been forced to take up, and &s;hall be forced to take up, for the pre&s;ervation of the Par|liament, Religion, the Laws and Liberties of the Kingdom, &s;hall not <MILESTONE N="20"> be laid down, until his Maje&s;ty &s;hall withdraw his Protection from &s;uch Per&s;ons as have been voted by both Hou&s;es to be Delinquents, or that &s;hall by both Hou&s;es be voted to be Delinquents, and &s;hall leave them to the ju&s;tice of the Parliament to be proceeded with according to their demerit; to the end that both this and &s;ucceeding Generations may take warning, with what danger they incur the like heynous crimes: and al&s;o to the end that tho&s;e great charges and damages, wherewith all the Common-wealth hath been burthen'd in the pre|mi&s;&s;es, &s;ince his Maje&s;ties departure from the Parliament, may be borne by the Delinquents, and other Malignant and Di&s;affected Per|&s;ons: <MILESTONE N="30"> and that all his Maje&s;ties good and well affected Subjects, who, by Loan of Monies, or otherwi&s;e at their charge, have a&s;&s;i&s;ted the Common-wealth, or &s;hall in like manner hereafter a&s;&s;i&s;t the Common-wealth in time of extreme danger, may be repayed all Sums of Money lent by them for tho&s;e purpo&s;es, and be &s;atisfied their charges &s;o &s;u|&s;tained, out of the E&s;tates of the &s;aid Delinquents, and of the Ma|lignant&endq; and Di&s;affected Party in this Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Declaration did the King no harm; for be&s;ides that it was evi|dent to all Men, that the King had done what&s;oever was in his power, <MILESTONE N="40"> or could be expected from him, for the prevention of a Civil War, all Per&s;ons of Honour and Quality plainly di&s;cerned, that they had no &s;afe|ty but in the pre&s;ervation of the Regal power, &s;ince their E&s;tates were already di&s;po&s;ed of by them who could declare whom they would De|linquents, and would infallibly declare all &s;uch who had not concurred with them. And the advantage the King receiv'd by tho&s;e overtures, and the pride, frowardne&s;s, and perver&s;ne&s;s of the Rebels, is not ima|ginable; his Levies of Men, and all other preparations for the War, be|ing incredibly advanced from the time of his fir&s;t Me&s;&s;age.

<P>WHEN the King came to <HI>Derby,</HI> he receiv'd clear information from <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|moves to</HI> Der|by.</NOTE> the well affected Party in <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> that the Town was at His devo|tion;

And therefore, as well in regard of the &s;trong and plea&s;ant &s;ituation of it (one &s;ide being defended by the <HI>Severn,</HI> the other having a &s;ecure pa&s;&s;age in|to <HI>Wales,</HI> the confines of <HI>Montgomery-&s;hire</HI> extending very near the &punc;Town) as for the corre&s;pondence with <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> of which City he hoped well, and that by his being at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> he &s;hould be as well able to &s;ecure <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> as by carrying his whole Train &s;o far North; be&s;ides that the other might give &s;ome apprehen&s;ion of his going into <HI>Ireland,</HI> which had been formerly mention'd, his Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd for that Town; <MILESTONE N="10"> and, after one days &s;tay at <HI>Derby,</HI> by ea&s;y marches he went thither, drawing his whole &s;mall Forces to a Rendezvous by <HI>Wellington,</HI> a days march &s;hort of <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> and that being the fir&s;t time that they were together, his Maje&s;ty then cau&s;ed his Military Orders for the Di&s;cipline and Government of the Army to be read at the head of each Regiment; and then, which is not fit ever to be forgotten, putting him&s;elf in the middle, where he might be be&s;t heard, not much unlike the Emperour <HI>Trajan,</HI> who when he made <HI>Sura</HI> Great Mar&s;hal of the <HI>Empire,</HI> gave him a Sword, <Q>&s;aying, &startq;Receive this Sword of me, and if I command as I ought, employ it in my defence; if I do otherwi&s;e draw it again&s;t&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> me, and take my life from me, his Maje&s;ty made this Speech to his Soldiers.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;GENTLEMEN, you have heard tho&s;e Orders read: it is Your part, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Speech and Prote&s;tation at the head of his Forces, after the read|ing his Orders of War.</NOTE> in your &s;everal places, to ob&s;erve them exactly; the time cannot be long before We come to Action, therefore you have the more rea&s;on to be careful; and I mu&s;t tell you, I &s;hall be very &s;evere in the puni&s;h|ing of tho&s;e, of what condition &s;oever, who tran&s;gre&s;s the&s;e In&s;tru|ctions. I cannot &s;u&s;pect your Courage and Re&s;olution; your Con|&s;cience and your Loyalty hath brought you hither, to Fight for your <MILESTONE N="30"> Religion, your King, and the Laws of the Land. You &s;hall meet with no Enemies but Traytors, mo&s;t of them <HI>Browni&s;ts, Anabapti&s;ts,</HI> and <HI>Atheists;</HI> &s;uch who de&s;ire to de&s;troy both Church and State, and who have already condemn'd You to ruin for being Loyal to Us. That you may &s;ee what u&s;e I mean to make of your Valour if it plea&s;e God to ble&s;s it with &s;ucce&s;s, I have thought fit to publi&s;h my Re&s;olution to you in a Prote&s;tation; which when you have heard me make, you will believe you cannot fight in a better Quarrel, in which I promi&s;e to live&endq; and dye with you.</Q></P>
<P>THE Prote&s;tation his Maje&s;ty was then plea&s;ed to make was in the&s;e <MILESTONE N="40"> words.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;I do promi&s;e in the pre&s;ence of Almighty God, and as I hope for his ble&s;&s;ing and protection, that I will, to the utmo&s;t of my power, defend and maintain the true Reform'd Prote&s;tant Religion, e&s;tabli&s;h'd in the Church of <HI>England;</HI> and, by the grace of God, in the &s;ame will&endq; live and dye.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I de&s;ire to govern by all the known Laws of the Land, and that the Liberty, and Property of the Subject, may be by them pre&s;erved with the &s;ame care, as my own ju&s;t Rights. And if it plea&s;e God, by his ble&s;&s;ing <MILESTONE N="50"> upon this Army, rai&s;ed for my nece&s;&s;ary defence, to pre&s;erve me from this Rebellion, I do &s;olemnly and faithfully promi&s;e, in the &s;ight of God, to maintain the ju&s;t priviledges and freedom of Parlia|ment,
<PB N="14" REF="290">
and to govern by the known Laws of the Land to my utmo&s;t power; and particularly, to ob&s;erve inviolably the Laws con&s;ented to by me this Parliament. In the mean while, if this time of War, and the great nece&s;&s;ity, and &s;traits I am now driven to, beget any violation of tho&s;e, I hope it &s;hall be imputed by God and Men to the Authors of this War, and not to Me; who have &s;o earne&s;tly laboured for the&endq; pre&s;ervation of the Peace of this Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;WHEN I willingly fail in the&s;e particulars, I will expect no aid or relief from any Man, or Protection from Heaven. But in this re&s;o|lution, I hope for the chearful a&s;&s;i&s;tance of all good Men, and am con|fident&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> of God's ble&s;&s;ing.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Prote&s;tation, and the manner and &s;olemnity of making it, gave not more life and encouragement to the little Army, than it did com|fort and &s;atisfaction to the Gentry and Inhabitants of tho&s;e parts; into whom the Parliament had infu&s;ed, that, if his Maje&s;ty prevailed by force, he would, with the &s;ame power, aboli&s;h all tho&s;e good Laws, which had been made this Parliament; &s;o that they looked upon this Prote&s;ta|tion, as a more ample &s;ecurity for their enjoying the benefit of tho&s;e Acts, than the Royal A&s;&s;ent he had before given. And a more general, <MILESTONE N="20"> and pa&s;&s;ionate expre&s;&s;ion of affections cannot be imagined, than he re|ceiv'd by the People of tho&s;e Counties of <HI>Derby, Stafford,</HI> and <HI>Shrop|&s;hire,</HI> as he pa&s;&s;ed; or a better reception, than he found at <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King comes to</HI> Shrewsbury.</NOTE> into which Town he enter'd on <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the 20^t^h of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>IT will be, and was then, wonder'd at, that, &s;ince the Parliament had a full and well formed Army, before the King had one full Regiment, and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was Him&s;elf come to <HI>Northampton,</HI> &s;ome days before his Maje&s;ty went from <HI>Nottingham,</HI> his Lord&s;hip neither di&s;|quieted the King whil&s;t he &s;tayed there, nor gave him any di&s;turbance in his March to <HI>Shrewsbury;</HI> which if he had done, he might either have <MILESTONE N="30"> taken him Pri&s;oner, or &s;o di&s;per&s;ed his &s;mall power, that it would never have been po&s;&s;ible for him to have gotten an Army together. But as the Earl had not yet receiv'd his In&s;tructions, &s;o they, upon whom he depended, avoided that expedition out of meer pride, and contempt of the King's Forces; and upon a pre&s;umption, that it would not be po&s;&s;i|ble for him to rai&s;e &s;uch a power, as would be able to look Their Ar|my in the face; but that, when he had in vain tried all other ways, and tho&s;e, who not only followed him upon their own charges, but &s;upported tho&s;e who were not able to bear their own (for his Army was maintain'd and paid by the Nobility and Gentry, who &s;erved likewi&s;e in their own <MILESTONE N="40"> Per&s;ons) were grown weary and unable longer to bear that burthen, his Maje&s;ty would be forced to put him&s;elf into Their Arms for Protection and Sub&s;i&s;tence; and &s;uch a Victory without blood had crown'd all their de&s;igns. And if their Army, which they pretended to rai&s;e only for their defence, and for the &s;afety of the King's Per&s;on, had been able to prevent the Kings rai&s;ing any, or if the King, in that Melancholick conjuncture at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> had return'd to <HI>White-Hall,</HI> he had ju&s;ti|fied all their proceedings, and could never after have refu&s;ed to yeild to what&s;oever they propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>AND it is mo&s;t certain, that the Common Soldiers of their Army <MILESTONE N="50"> were generally per&s;waded, that they &s;hould never be brought to fight; but that the King was in truth little better than impri&s;oned by evil Coun&s;ellors, Malignants, Delinquents, and Cavaliers (the termes ap|plied
<PB N="15" REF="300">

<P>ON the other hand, the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> thinking tho&s;e few fugitives <MILESTONE N="10"> not worth his farther care, and that they would be ea&s;ily apprehended by the Committee of the Militia, which was very powerful in <HI>Devon,</HI> and <HI>Cornwall,</HI> contented him&s;elf with having driven away the Mar|quis, and &s;o expelled all hope of rai&s;ing an Army for the King in the We&s;t; and retired with his Forces to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> as S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> had done from <HI>Port&s;mouth;</HI> &s;o that as it was not expected, that the Forces about his Maje&s;ty could be able to defend him, again&s;t &s;o pui&s;&s;ant an Army, &s;o it was not imaginable that he could receive any addition of &s;trength from any other parts. For wherever they found any Per&s;on of Quality inclined to the King, or but di&s;inclined to Them, <MILESTONE N="20"> they immediately &s;ei&s;ed upon his Per&s;on, and &s;ent him in great triumph to the Parliament; who committed him to Pri&s;on, with all circum|&s;tances of cruelty and inhumanity.</P>
<P>THUS they took Pri&s;oner the Lord <HI>Mountague</HI> of <HI>Boughton,</HI> at his Hou&s;e in <HI>Northampton-&s;hire,</HI> a Per&s;on of great reverence being above four&s;core years of age, and of unblemi&s;h'd Reputation, for declaring him&s;elf un&s;atisfied with their di&s;obedient and undutiful proceedings again&s;t the King, and more expre&s;sly again&s;t their Ordinance for the Mi|litia; and notwith&s;tanding that he had a Brother of the Hou&s;e of Peers, the Lord Privy Seal, and a Nephew the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> who had as <MILESTONE N="30"> full a power in that Council as any Man, and a Son in the Hou&s;e of Commons very unlike his Father; his Lord&s;hip was committed to the Tower a clo&s;e Pri&s;oner; and though he was afterwards remitted to more Air, he continued a Pri&s;oner to his death.</P>
<P>THUS they took Pri&s;oner in <HI>Oxford-&s;hire</HI> the Earl of <HI>Berk-&s;hire,</HI> and three or four principal Gentlemen of that County; and committed them to the Tower, for no other rea&s;on but wi&s;hing well to the King; for they never appear'd in the lea&s;t Action in his Service. And thus they took Pri&s;oner the Earl of <HI>Bath</HI> in <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> who neither had, or ever meant to do the King the lea&s;t &s;ervice; but only out of the moro&s;ity of <MILESTONE N="40"> his own Nature, had before, in the Hou&s;e, expre&s;s'd him&s;elf not of their minds; and carried him, with many other Gentlemen of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>So|mer&s;et,</HI> with a &s;trong Guard of Hor&s;e, to <HI>London;</HI> where, after they had been expo&s;ed to the rudene&s;s and reproach of the Common people, who called them Traytors and Rebels to the Parliament, and pur&s;ued them with &s;uch u&s;age as they u&s;e to the mo&s;t infamous Malefactors, they were, without ever being examin'd, or charged with any particular crime, committed to &s;everal Pri&s;ons; &s;o that not only all the Pri&s;ons about <HI>London</HI> were quickly fill'd with Per&s;ons of Honour, and great re|putation for &s;obriety and integrity to their Counties, but new Pri&s;ons <MILESTONE N="$0"> were made for their reception; and, which was a new and barbarous in|vention, very many Per&s;ons of very good Quality, both of the Clergy and Laity, were committed to Pri&s;on on board the Ships in the River

And that the lo&s;s of their Liberty might not be all their puni&s;hment, it was the u&s;ual cour&s;e, and very few e&s;caped it, after any Man was committed as a notorious Malignant (which was the brand) that his E&s;tate and Goods were &s;ei&s;ed, or plunder'd by an Order from the Hou&s;e of Commons, or &s;ome Com|mittee, or the Soldiers, who in their march took the Goods of all Pa|pi&s;ts and eminent Malignants, as lawful prize; or by the fury and Li|cence of the Common people, who were in all places grown to that bar|barityand rage again&s;t the Nobility and Gentry (under the Style of Ca|valiers) <MILESTONE N="10"> that it was not &s;afe for any to live at their Hou&s;es, who were taken notice of as no Votaries to the Parliament.</P>
<P>So the Common people (no doubt by the advice of their Superiors) in <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> on a &s;uddain be&s;et the Hou&s;e of S^r <HI>John Lucas,</HI> one of the be&s;t Gentlemen of that County, and of the mo&s;t eminent affection to the King, being a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber to the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> and upon pretence that he was going to the King, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of all his Hor&s;es and Armes, &s;ei&s;ed upon his Per&s;on, and u&s;ed him with all po&s;&s;ible indignities, not without &s;ome threats to murther him; and when the Mayor of <HI>Colchester,</HI> whither he was brought&punc; with more hu|manity <MILESTONE N="20"> than the re&s;t, offer'd to keep him Pri&s;oner in his own Hou&s;e, till the plea&s;ure of the Parliament &s;hould be farther known, they compell'd him, or he was willing to be compell'd, to &s;end him to the Common Goal; where he remain'd, glad of that &s;ecurity, till the Hou&s;e of Com|mons removed him to another Pri&s;on (without ever charging him with any crime) having &s;ent all his Hor&s;es to the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex,</HI> to be u&s;ed in the &s;ervice of that Army.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time the &s;ame Rabble enter'd the Hou&s;e of the Coun|te&s;s of <HI>Rivers</HI> near <HI>Colchester;</HI> for no other ground, than that &s;he was a Papi&s;t; and in few hours disfurni&s;h'd it of all the Goods, which had <MILESTONE N="30"> been many years with great curio&s;ity providing, and were not of le&s;s value than forty thou&s;and pounds &s;terling; the Counte&s;s her &s;elf hardly e&s;caping, after great in&s;olence had been u&s;ed to her Per&s;on: And &s;he could never receive any reparation from the Parliament.

<P>I mu&s;t not forget, though it cannot be remember'd without much horrour, that this &s;trange Wild-fire among the people, was not &s;o much <MILESTONE N="40"> and &s;o furiou&s;ly kindled by the breath of the Parliament, as of their Clergy, who both admini&s;ter'd fuel, and blow'd the Coales in the Hou&s;es too. The&s;e Men having creeped into, and at la&s;t driven all Learned and Orthodox Men from the Pulpits, had, as is before remember'd, from the beginning of this Parliament, under the Notion of Reformation and extirpating of Popery, infu&s;ed &s;editious inclinations into the hearts of Men again&s;t the pre&s;ent Government of the Church, with many libel|lous invectives again&s;t the State too. But &s;ince the rai&s;ing an Army, and rejecting the Kings la&s;t overture of a Treaty, they contain'd them|&s;elves within no bounds; and as freely and without controul, inveighed <MILESTONE N="50"> again&s;t the Per&s;on of the King, as they had before again&s;t the wor&s;t Ma|lignant; prophanely, and bla&s;phemou&s;ly applying what&s;oever had been &s;poken and declared by God Him&s;elf, or the Prophets, again&s;t the mo&s;t

<P>THERE are Monuments enough in the &s;editious Sermons at that time printed, and in the Memories of Men, of others not printed, of &s;uch wre&s;ting, and perverting of Scripture to the odious purpo&s;es of the Preacher, that pious Men will not look over without trembling.

There were more than M^r <HI>Mar&s;hall,</HI> who from the 23^d Ver&s;e of the 5^t^h Chap. of <HI>Judges.

It would fill a Volume to in&s;ert all the impious madne&s;s of this kind, &s;o that the complaint of the Prophet <HI>Ezekiel,</HI> might mo&s;t truly, and &s;ea&s;onably have been applied, <HI>There is a con&s;piracy of her Prophets in the mid&s;t</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Ezek.

<P>YET this Commander, coming early in the morning, when the &s;mall Guard which had watched, conceiving all to be &s;ecure, were gon to re&s;t, and being within Mu&s;quet &s;hot of the Gate before he was di&s;cover'd, finding that weak Gate &s;hut, or rather clo&s;ed again&s;t him, and not that quick appearance of a Party within the Town, as he promi&s;ed him&s;elf, without doing any harm, retired in great di&s;order, and with &s;o much <MILESTONE N="40"> ha&s;t, that the wearied Hor&s;e, &s;ent out pre&s;ently to attend him, could not overtake any of his Train; &s;o that when Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> came thi|ther, they did not conceive any con&s;iderable Party of the Enemy to be near.

And, it may be, it was well they had not; for if all tho&s;e Officers had been in the heads of their &s;everal Troops, it is not impo&s;&s;ible it might have been wor&s;e. <Q>But the Prince in&s;tantly declaring, &startq;&endq; that he would Charge;</Q> his Brother, the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary Ge|neral <HI>Wilmot,</HI> S^r <HI>John Byron,</HI> S^r <HI>Lewis Dives,</HI> and all tho&s;e Officers and Gentlemen, who&s;e Troops were not pre&s;ent or ready, put them&s;elves next the Prince; the other wearied Troops coming in order after them.</P>

<P>THIS Rencounter proved of great advantage, and benefit to the King. For it being the fir&s;t Action his Hor&s;e had been brought to, and that party of the Enemy being the mo&s;t pick'd and choice Men, it gave his Troops great courage, and render'd the name of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> very ter|rible, and exceedingly appalled the adver&s;ary; in&s;omuch as they had not, in a long time after, any confidence in their Hor&s;e, and their very Numbers were much le&s;&s;en'd by it. For that whole party being routed, and the chief Officers of Name and Reputation either kill'd, or taken, though the number lo&s;t upon the place was not con&s;iderable, there were <MILESTONE N="40"> very many more who never return'd to the &s;ervice; and, which was wor&s;e, for their own excu&s;e, in all places, talked aloud of the incredible, and unre&s;i&s;tible courage of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and the King's Hor&s;e. So that, from this time, the Parliament begun to be apprehen&s;ive, that the bu&s;ine&s;s would not be as ea&s;ily ended, as it was begun; and that the King would not be brought back to them with their bare Votes. Yet how faintly &s;oever the private pul&s;es beat (for no que&s;tion many who had made greate&s;t noi&s;e, wi&s;h'd they were again to choo&s;e their &s;ide) the two Hou&s;es were &s;o far from any vi&s;ible abatement of their mettle, that to weigh down any po&s;&s;ible &s;uppo&s;ition that they might be inclined, or <MILESTONE N="50"> drawn to treat with the King, or that they had any apprehen&s;ion that the people would be le&s;s firm, and con&s;tant to them, they proceeded to bolder Acts to evince both, than they had yet done.</P>

<P>BESIDES this, that it might appear, they were nothing jealous or apprehen&s;ive of the Peoples defection and revolt from them, whereas before they had made the general de&s;ire of the Kingdom the ground, and argument for what&s;oever they had done, and had only invited Men to <MILESTONE N="30"> contribute freely what they thought fit, to the charge in hand, with|out compelling any who were unwilling; they now took notice not on|ly of tho&s;e who oppo&s;ed their proceedings, or privately di&s;&s;waded other Men from concurring with them, but of tho&s;e, who either out of fear, or covetou&s;ne&s;s, or both, had neglected really to contribute; <Q>and there|fore they boldly publi&s;hed their Votes (which were Laws to the Peo|ple, or of much more Authority) &startq;That all &s;uch Per&s;ons, as &s;hould not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Votes of both Hou&s;es for rai&s;ing and procuring Mo|ney.</NOTE> contribute to the charge of the Common-wealth, in that time of emi|nent&endq; nece&s;&s;ity, &s;hould be di&s;arm'd and &s;ecured;</Q> <Q>and that this Vote might be the more terrible, they order'd, the &s;ame day, the Mayor and <MILESTONE N="40"> Sheriffs of <HI>London</HI> &startq;to &s;earch the Hou&s;es, and &s;ei&s;e the Armes belong|ing to &s;ome Aldermen, and other principal &s;ub&s;tantial Citizens of&endq; <HI>London,</HI> whom they named in their Order;</Q> <Q>&startq;for that it appeared by the report from their Committee, that they had not contributed, as&endq; they ought, to the charge of the Common-wealth.</Q></P>
<P>BY this means the poore&s;t, and lowe&s;t of the People, became Infor|mers again&s;t the riche&s;t, and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial; and the re&s;ult of &s;earch|ing the Hou&s;es and &s;ei&s;ing the Armes was, the taking away Plate, and things of the greate&s;t Value, and very frequently plundering what&s;oever was worth the keeping. <Q>They farther appointed, &startq;that the Fines, Rents, <MILESTONE N="50"> and Profits, of Arch-Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Deans, Deans and Chapters, and of all Delinquents, who had taken up Armes again&s;t the Parliament, or had been Active in the Commi&s;&s;ion of Array, &s;hould be &s;eque&s;ter'd

&endq; for the u&s;e and benefit of the Common-wealth.</Q> <Q>And that the King might not fare better than his Adherents, they directed &startq;all his Reve|nue, ari&s;ing out of Rents, Fines in Courts of Ju&s;tice, Compo&s;ition for Wards, and the like, and all other his Revenue &s;hould be brought into the &s;everal Courts, and other places, where they ought to be paid in, and not i&s;&s;ued forth, or paid forth, until farther Order &s;hould be taken&endq; by both Hou&s;es of Parliament;</Q> without &s;o much as a&s;&s;igning him any part of his own, towards the &s;upport of his own Per&s;on.</P>
<P>THIS &s;tout inva&s;ion of the Peoples property, and compelling them to part with what was mo&s;t precious to them, any part of their E&s;tates, <MILESTONE N="10"> was thought by many an unpopular Act, in the morning of their So|veraignty, and that it would wonderfully have irreconciled their new Subjects to them. But the Conductors well under&s;tood, that their Em|pire already depended more on the Fear, than Love of the People; and that as they could carry on the War only by having Money enough to pay the Soldiers, &s;o, that whil&s;t they had That, probably they &s;hould not want Men to recruit their Armies upon any mi&s;adventure.</P>
<P>IT cannot be imagined, how great advantages the King received by the Parliaments rejecting the King's Me&s;&s;ages for Peace, and their man|ner in doing it. All Mens mouths were open'd again&s;t them, the Me&s;|&s;ages <MILESTONE N="20"> and An&s;wers being read in all Churches; they who could not &s;erve him in their Per&s;ons, contrived ways to &s;upply him with Money. Some eminent Governours in the Univer&s;ities gave him notice that all the Colleges were very plentifully &s;upplied with Plate, which would amount to a good Value, and lay u&s;ele&s;s in their Trea&s;uries, there being enough be&s;ides for their Common U&s;e; and there was not the lea&s;t doubt, but that when&s;oever his Maje&s;ty &s;hould think fit to require that Trea&s;ure, it would all be &s;ent to him. Of this the King had long thought, and, when he was at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> in that Melancholick &s;ea&s;on, two Gentle|men were di&s;patch'd away to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and to <HI>Cambridge</HI> (two to each) <MILESTONE N="30"> with Letters to the &s;everal Vice-Chancellors, that they &s;hould move the Heads, and Principals of the &s;everal Colleges and Halls, that they would &s;end their Plate to the King; private adverti&s;ements being fir&s;t &s;ent to &s;ome tru&s;ty Per&s;ons to prepare, and di&s;po&s;e tho&s;e, without who&s;e con|&s;ent the &s;ervice could not be performed.</P>
<P>THIS whole affair was tran&s;acted with &s;o great &s;ecrecy, and di&s;cre|tion, that the Me&s;&s;engers return'd from the two Univer&s;ities, in as &s;hort a time as &s;uch a Journey could well be made; and brought with them all, or very near all their Plate, and a con&s;iderable Sum of Money, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Uni|ver&s;ities con|tributed their Money and Plate to the King.</NOTE> which was &s;ent as a Pre&s;ent to his Maje&s;ty from &s;everal of the Heads of <MILESTONE N="40"> Colleges, out of their own particular Stores; &s;ome Scholars coming with it, and helping to procure Hor&s;es and Carts for the &s;ervice; all which came &s;afe to <HI>Nottingham,</HI> at the time when there appeared no more expectation of a Treaty, and contributed much to rai&s;ing the dejected Spirits of the place. The Plate was pre&s;ently weighed out, and deli|vered to the &s;everal Officers, who were entru&s;ted to make Levies of Hor&s;e and Foot, and who received it as Money, the re&s;t was carefully pre&s;erved to be carried with the King, when he &s;hould remove from thence; &s;ecret Orders being &s;ent to the Officers of the Mint, to be rea|dy to come to his Maje&s;ty a&s;&s;oon as he &s;hould require them, which he <MILESTONE N="50"> meant to do, a&s;&s;oon as he &s;hould find him&s;elf in a place convenient. There was now no more complaining or murmuring. Some Gentlemen under|took to make Levies upon their Credit, and Intere&s;t, and others &s;ent Mo|ney to the King upon their own Inclinations.</P>

THERE was a plea&s;ant Story, then much &s;poken of in the Court, which admini&s;ter'd &s;ome Mirth. There were two great Men who lived near <HI>Nottingham,</HI> both Men of great Fortunes and of great Par&s;imony, and known to have much Money lying by them. To the former the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> was &s;ent, to the latter, <HI>John A&s;hburnham</HI> of the Bed-Cham|ber, and of entire confidence with his Ma&s;ter; each of them with a Let|ter, all written with the King's hand, to borrow of each ten or five thou&s;and pounds. <HI>Capel</HI> was very civilly received by One, and enter|tain'd as well as the ill accommodations in his Hou&s;e, and his manner of living would admit. <Q>He expre&s;s'd, with wonderful civil profe&s;&s;ions of <MILESTONE N="10"> duty, &startq;the great trouble he &s;u&s;tain'd, in not being able to comply with&endq; his Maje&s;ties Commands:</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;all men knew that he neither had, nor could have Money, becau&s;e he had every year, of ten or a dozen which were pa&s;t, purcha&s;ed a thou&s;and pounds Land a year; and there|fore he could not be imagin'd to have any Money lying by him, which he never lov'd to have. But, he &s;aid, he had a Neighbour, who liv'd within few Miles of him, who was good for nothing, and liv'd like a Hog, not allowing him&s;elf Nece&s;&s;aries, and who could not have &s;o lit|tle&endq; as twenty thou&s;and pounds in the &s;curvy Hou&s;e in which he liv'd;</Q> and advi&s;ed, <Q>&startq;he might be &s;ent to, who could not deny the having of&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> Money;</Q> and concluded with great duty to the King, and dete&s;tation of the Parliament, and as if he meant to con&s;ider farther of the thing, and to endeavour to get &s;ome Money for him, which though he did not remember to &s;end, his affections were good, and he was afterwards kill'd in the King's Service.</P>
<P>ASHBURNHAM got no more Money, nor half &s;o many good words. That Lord had &s;o little corre&s;pondence with the Court, that he had ne|ver heard his Name, and when he had read the King's Letter, he asked from whom it was; <Q>and when he told him, &startq;&endq;he &s;aw it was from the King,</Q> <Q>he replied, &startq;that he was not &s;uch a fool as to believe it. That he had&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> receiv'd Letters both from the King and his Father;</Q> and ha&s;tily run|ning out of the Room, return'd with half a dozen Letters in his hand; <Q>&s;aying, &startq;that tho&s;e were all the King's Letters, and that they allways begun with <HI>Right Tru&s;ty and Well beloved,</HI> and the King's Name was ever at the Top; but this Letter begun with his own Name, and ended with your loving friend C. R. which, he &s;aid, he was &s;ure, could not&endq; be the Kings hand.</Q> His other treatment was according to this, and after an ill &s;upper, he was &s;hewed an indifferent bed; <Q>the Lord telling him, &startq;&endq;that he would confer more of the matter in the morning;</Q> he having &s;ent a Servant with a Letter to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> who was his <MILESTONE N="40"> Wifes Nephew, and who had &s;carce ever &s;een his Uncle. The Man came to <HI>Nottingham</HI> about Midnight, and found my Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> in his Bed. <Q>The Letter was to tell him, &startq;that one <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> was with him, who brought him a Letter, which he &s;aid was from the King; but he knew that could not be; and therefore he de&s;ired to know, who this Man&endq; was, whom he kept in his Hou&s;e till the Me&s;&s;enger &s;hould return.</Q> In &s;pight of the laughter, which could not be forborne, the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> made ha&s;t to inform him of the condition and Quality of the Per&s;on, and that the Letter was writ with the Kings own hand, which he &s;el|dom vouch&s;afed to do. And the Me&s;&s;enger returning early the next <MILESTONE N="50"> morning, his Lord&s;hip treated M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> with &s;o different a re|&s;pect, that he, who knew nothing of the cau&s;e, believ'd, that he &s;hould return with all the Money that was de&s;ired. But it was not long before
<PB N="26" REF="420">
he was undeceived. <Q>The Lord with as chearful a Countenance as his could be, for he had a very unu&s;ual and unplea&s;ant face, told him, &startq;that though he had no Money Him&s;elf, but was in extreme want of it, he would tell him where he might have Money enough; that he had a Neighbour, who liv'd within four or five Miles, that never did good to any body, and lov'd no body but him&s;elf, who had a world of Mo|ney, and could furni&s;h the King with as much as he had need of, and if he &s;hould deny that he had Money when the King &s;ent to him, he knew were he had one Trunk full, and would di&s;cover it; and that he was &s;o ill belov'd and had &s;o few friends, that no body would care how&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> the King u&s;ed him.</Q> This good Coun&s;el was all M^r <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> could make of him: and yet this wretched Man was &s;o far from wi&s;hing well to the Parliament, that when they had prevailed, and were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the whole Kingdom, as well as of <HI>Nottingham-&s;hire,</HI> he would not give them one penny; nor compound for his Delinquency, as they made the having lived in the King's Quarters to be; but &s;uffer'd his whole E&s;tate to be &s;eque&s;ter'd, and lived in a very mi&s;erable fa&s;hion, only by what he could ravi&s;h from his Tenants; who, though they paid their Rents to the Parliament, were forced by his rage and threats to part with &s;o much as kept him, till he died, in that condition he cho&s;e to <MILESTONE N="20"> live in: His con&s;cience being powerful enough to deny Him&s;elf, though it could not di&s;po&s;e him to grant to the King. And thus the two Me&s;|&s;engers return'd to the King, &s;o near the &s;ame time, that he who came fir&s;t, had not given his account to the King, before the other enter'd into his pre&s;ence.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame day, a Gentleman in tho&s;e parts, known to be very rich, being pre&s;&s;ed to lend the King five hundred pounds, &s;ent him a pre&s;ent of one hundred pieces in Gold; <Q>&startq;which, he &s;aid, he had procured with great difficulty; and prote&s;ted, with many execrable imprecations, that he had never in his life &s;een five hundred pounds of his own to|gether;&endq;</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"> when, within one Month after the Kings departure, the Par|liament Troops, which borrowed in another &s;tile, took five thou&s;and pounds from him, which was lodged with him, in the Chamber in which he lay. Which is therefore mention'd in this place, that upon this oc|ca&s;ion it may be &s;een, that the unthrifty retention of their Money, which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the &s;pirits of tho&s;e, who did really wi&s;h the King all the &s;ucce&s;s he wi&s;hed for him&s;elf, was one unhappy cau&s;e of all his misfor|tunes: and if they had, in the beginning, but lent the King the fifth part of what, after infinite lo&s;&s;es, they found nece&s;&s;ary to &s;acrifice to his Enemies, in the conclu&s;ion, to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from total ruin, his <MILESTONE N="40"> Maje&s;ty had been able, with Gods ble&s;&s;ing, to have pre&s;erved Them, and to have de&s;troyed all his Enemies.</P>
<P>THE news of the important advantage before <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> found the King at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> whither his Maje&s;ty thought nece&s;&s;ary to make a Jour|ney him&s;elf, a&s;&s;oon as he came to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> both to a&s;&s;ure that City to his Service, which was the Key to <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to countenance the Lord <HI>Strange</HI> (who, by the death of his Father, became Earl of <HI>Derby)</HI> again&s;t &s;ome oppo&s;ition he met with, on the behalf of the Parliament. Here <HI>Crane,</HI> &s;ent by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> gave his Maje&s;ty an Account of that Action; and pre&s;ented him with the En&s;igns, which had been taken; <MILESTONE N="50"> and inform'd him of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s being in <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> which made the King return &s;ooner to <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> than he intended, and before the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of that power, which a little longer &s;tay would have given him.</P>
<P><PB N="27" REF="430">
PRINCE <HI>Rupert</HI> the &s;ame night, after his Victory, finding the gro&s;s of the Rebels Army to be within five or &s;ix miles, again&s;t which that City was in no degree tenable, though all the King's Foot had been there, retired from <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> on the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> &s;ide of the River, without any di|&s;turbance, into his Quarters near <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and with all his Pri&s;oners, Colonel <HI>Sandys</HI> only excepted, whom he left to dye of his wounds there; the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex</HI> being &s;o much &s;tartled with this late defeat, that he advanced not in two days after; and then being &s;urely inform'd, that he &s;hould find no re&s;i&s;tance, he enter'd with his Army into <HI>Worce&s;ter;</HI> u&s;ing great &s;everity to tho&s;e Citizens, who had been eminently inclined <MILESTONE N="10"> to the King's Service, and &s;ending the principal of them Pri&s;oners to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the Kings coming to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> there was a very great con|flux <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King comes to</HI> Shrewsbury.</NOTE> of the Gentry there, and the Neighbouring Counties, which were generally well affected, and made great profe&s;&s;ions of duty to his Ma|je&s;ty: &s;ome of them undertook to make Levies of Hor&s;e and Foot, and perform'd it at their own charge. The Town was very commodious in all re&s;pects, &s;trong in it's &s;ituation; and in re&s;pect of it's Neighbourhood to North <HI>Wales,</HI> and the u&s;e of the <HI>Severn,</HI> yeilded excellent provi&s;ions of all kinds; &s;o that both Court and Army were very $ell accommo|dated, <MILESTONE N="20"> only the incurable di&s;ea&s;e of want of Money could not be a&s;|&s;waged in either. Yet whil&s;t they &s;at &s;till, it was not very &s;en&s;ible, much le&s;s importunate. The Soldiers behaved them&s;elves orderly, and the People were not inclined, or provoked to complain of their new Gue&s;ts; and the remainder of the Plate, which was brought from the Univer&s;i|ties, together with the &s;mall pre&s;ents in Money, which were made to the King by many particular Per&s;ons, &s;upplied the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ary expences very conveniently. But it was ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd, that, when the Army &s;hould move, which the King re&s;olved it &s;hould do with all po&s;|&s;ible expedition, the nece&s;&s;ity of Money would be very great, and the Train <MILESTONE N="30"> of Artillery, which is commonly a Spunge that can hardly be filled, was de&s;titute of all things nece&s;&s;ary for motion. Nor was there any hope that it could march, till a good Sum of Money were a&s;&s;ign'd to it; &s;ome Carriage-Hor&s;es, and Waggons, which were prepared for the Service of <HI>Ireland,</HI> and lay ready at <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> to be tran&s;ported with the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> Lieutenant of that Kingdom, were brought to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> by his Maje&s;ties Order, for his own Train: And the Earls pa&s;&s;ionate labouring to prevent, or remedy that application, with &s;ome other rea&s;ons, hinder'd the Earl him&s;elf from pur&s;uing that Journey; and, in the end, deprived him of that province. But this &s;ea&s;onable ad|dition <MILESTONE N="40"> to the Train encrea&s;ed the nece&s;&s;ity of Money, there being more u&s;e of it thereby.</P>
<P>TWO Expedients were found to make &s;uch a competent provi&s;ion for all wants, that they were at la&s;t broken through. <Q>Some Per&s;on of that inclination had in&s;inuated to the King, that, &startq;if the Roman Ca|tholicks, which that, and the adjacent Counties were well inhabited by, were &s;ecretly treated with, a con&s;iderable Sum of Money might be rai&s;ed among them; but it mu&s;t be carried with great privacy, that no notice might be taken of it, the Parliament having declared &s;o&endq; great Animo&s;ities again&s;t them;</Q> nor did it in that conjuncture concern <MILESTONE N="50"> the King le&s;s that it &s;hould be very &s;ecret, to avoid the &s;candal of a clo&s;e conjunction with the Papi&s;ts, which was every day imputed to him. <Q>Upon many con&s;ultations how, and in what method to carry on this
<PB N="28" REF="440">
De&s;ign, the King was inform'd, &startq;that if he would depute a Per&s;on, much tru&s;ted by him, to that &s;ervice, the Roman Catholicks would tru&s;t him, and a&s;&s;ign one or two of their Body to confer with him, and by&endq; this means the work might be carried on.</Q> Hereupon the King &s;ent for that Per&s;on, and told him this whole matter, as it is here &s;et down, and required him to con&s;ult with &s;uch a Per&s;on, whom he would &s;end to him the next morning. The next morning a Per&s;on of Quality very much tru&s;ted by all that Party, came to him to confer upon that &s;ub|ject; and &s;hewed a li&s;t of the Names of all the Gentlemen of Quality and Fortune of that Religion, who were all convict Recu&s;ants, and liv'd <MILESTONE N="10"> within tho&s;e Counties of <HI>Shrop&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Stafford.</HI> They appear'd to be a good Number of very valuable Men, on who&s;e behalf he had only Au|thority to conclude, though he believ'd that the method, they agreed on there, would be &s;ubmitted to, and confirm'd by that Party in all other places. <Q>He &s;aid &startq;they would by no means hearken to any motion for the loan of Money, for which they had paid &s;o dear, upon their &s;erving&endq; the King in that manner, in his fir&s;t expedition again&s;t the <HI>Scots.</HI></Q> It was in the end agreed upon, that the King &s;hould write to every one of them to pay him an advance of two, or three years of &s;uch Rent, as they were every year obliged to pay to him, upon the compo&s;ition they had <MILESTONE N="20"> made with him for their E&s;tates; which would amount to a con&s;idera|ble Sum of Money. And the&s;e Letters were accordingly writ, and within ten or twelve days, between four and five thou&s;and pounds were return'd to his Maje&s;ty; which was a &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply for his affairs.</P>
<P>AT his return to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> the King found as much done towads his March, as he expected. And then the other Expedient (which was hinted before) for Money offer'd it &s;elf. There was a Gentleman of a very good extraction, and of the be&s;t E&s;tate of any Gentleman of that Country, who lived within four or five miles of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and was looked upon as a very prudent Man, and had a very powerful influence <MILESTONE N="30"> upon that People, and was of undoubted Affections and Loyalty to the King, and to the Government both in Church, and State: his Elde&s;t Son was a young Gentleman of great expectation, and of excellent parts, a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who had behaved him&s;elf there very well. <Q>This Gentleman intimated to a friend of his, &startq;that, if his Father might be made a Baron, he did believe he might be prevailed&endq; with, to pre&s;ent his Maje&s;ty with a good Sum of Money.</Q> It was pro|po&s;ed to the King, who had no mind to embrace the propo&s;ition, <Q>his Maje&s;ty taking occa&s;ion often to &s;peak again&s;t &startq;making Merchandize of Honour; how much the Crown &s;uffer'd at pre&s;ent by the licence of <MILESTONE N="40"> that kind, which had been u&s;ed during the favour of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham;</HI> and that he had not taken a firmer Re&s;olution again&s;t&endq; many things, than again&s;t this particular Expedient for rai&s;ing Money.</Q> However, after he return'd from <HI>Chester,</HI> and found by the increa&s;e of his Levies, and the good di&s;po&s;ition all things were in, that he might in a &s;hort time be able to march, and in &s;o good a condition, that he &s;hould rather &s;eek the Rebels, than decline meeting with them, if the indi&s;pen&s;able want of Money did not make his motion impo&s;&s;ible; the merit and ability of the Per&s;on, and the fair expectation from his Po&s;te|rity, he having two Sons, both very hopeful, prevailed with his Maje&s;ty <MILESTONE N="50"> to re&s;ume the &s;ame overture; and in few days it was perfected, and the Gentleman was made a Baron; who pre&s;ented the Sum of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds to his Maje&s;ty; whereupon all preparations for the Army were pro&s;ecuted with effect.</P>
<P><PB N="29" REF="450">
ASSOON as the King came to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> he had di&s;patched his Letters and Agents into <HI>Wales, Che&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> to quicken the Levies of Men which were making there, and return'd from <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> through the North part of <HI>Wales</HI> (where he found the People cordial to him, and arming them&s;elves for him) to <HI>Shrewsbury.</HI> The King's cu&s;tom was in all Counties, through which he pa&s;&s;ed, to cau&s;e the High Sheriff to draw all the Gentlemen, and the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Inhabitants of tho&s;e parts together, to whom (be&s;ides his care&s;&s;ing the principal Gentlemen &s;everally, familiarly, and very obligingly) he allways &s;poke &s;omething publickly (which was afterwards printed) telling them, <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P><Q>&startq;THAT it was a benefit to him from the In&s;olencies and Misfortunes, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sub&s;tance of the King's Speeches to the Gentry and Commonalty of the &s;everal Counties thro' which he pa&s;&s;ed.</NOTE> which had driven him about, that they had brought him to &s;o good a part of his Kingdom, and to &s;o faithful a part of his People. He hoped, neither They, nor He &s;hould repent their coming together. He would do His part, that they might not; and of Them he was con|fident&endq; befor he came.</Q> <Q>He told them, &startq;the re&s;idence of an Army was not u&s;ually plea&s;ant to any place; and His might carry more fear with it, &s;ince it might be thought (being robbed, and &s;poiled of all his own, and &s;uch terror u&s;ed to fright and keep all Men from &s;upplying him)&endq; he mu&s;t only live upon the aid and relief of his Peop$$.</Q> <Q>But he bid <MILESTONE N="20"> them &startq;&endq;not be afraid;</Q> <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;he wi&s;hed to God, his poor Subjects &s;uffer'd no more by the In&s;olence, and Violence of that Army rai&s;ed again&s;t him, though they had made them&s;elves wanton with Plenty, than they &s;hould do by His; and yet he feared he &s;hould not be able to prevent all di&s;orders; he would do his be&s;t; and promi&s;ed them,&endq; no man &s;hould be a lo&s;er by him if He could help it.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid &startq;he had &s;ent for a Mint, and would melt down all his own Plate, and expo&s;e all his Land to Sale, or Mortgage, that he might bring the lea&s;t pre&s;|&s;ure&endq; upon them.</Q> <Q>However, he invited them &startq;to do that For him, and them&s;elves, for the maintenance of their Religion, and the Law of <MILESTONE N="30"> the Land (by which they enjoyed all that they had) which other Men&endq; did Again&s;t them;</Q> <Q>he de&s;ired them, &startq;not to &s;uffer &s;o good a cau&s;e to be lo&s;t, for want of &s;upplying him with that, which would be taken from them, by tho&s;e who pur&s;ued his Maje&s;ty with that violence. And whil&s;t tho&s;e ill Men &s;acrificed their Money, Plate, and utmo&s;t Indu&s;try, to de&s;troy the Common-wealth, They would be no le&s;s liberal to pre|&s;erve it. He bid them a&s;&s;ure them&s;elves, if it plea&s;ed God to ble&s;s him with &s;ucce&s;s, he would remember the A&s;&s;i&s;tance every particular Man&endq; gave him to his advantage.</Q> <Q>However it would hereafter (how furiou&s;ly &startq;&s;oever the minds of &s;ome Men were now po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed) be honour, and <MILESTONE N="40"> comfort to them, that with &s;ome charge and trouble to them&s;elves, they had done Their part to &s;upport their King and pre&s;erve the&endq; Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty allways took notice of any particular reports, which, either with reference to the publick, or their private concerns, might make impre&s;&s;ion upon that People, and gave clear An&s;wers to them. With this gracious and Princely demeanour, it is hardly credible how much he won upon the People; &s;o that not only his Army daily en|crea&s;ed by Voluntiers (for there was not a Man pre&s;&s;ed) but &s;uch pro|portions of Plate, and Money, were voluntarily brought in, that the <MILESTONE N="50"> Army was fully and con&s;tantly paid: the King having erected a Mint at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> more for reputation than u&s;e (For, for want of Work-men, and In&s;truments, they could not Coyn a thou&s;and pounds a week) and
<PB N="30" REF="460">
cau&s;ing all his own Plate, for the Service of his Hou&s;hold, to be deli|ver'd there, made other Men think, theirs was the le&s;s worth the pre|&s;erving.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex</HI> came to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> he &s;ent a Gen|tleman <HI>(Fleetwood,</HI> the &s;ame who had afterwards &s;o great power in the Army, but then a Trooper in his Guards) to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> without a Trumpet, or any other ceremony than a Letter to the Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et;</HI> <Q>in which he &s;aid, &startq;he was appointed by the Parliament, to cau&s;e a Pe|tition, then in his hands, to be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty; and there|fore de&s;ired his Lord&s;hip to know his Maje&s;ties plea&s;ure, when he <MILESTONE N="10"> would be plea&s;ed to receive it from &s;uch Per&s;ons, as he &s;hould &s;end&endq; over with it.</Q> <Q>The Earl of <HI>Dor&s;et</HI> (by his Maje&s;ties command, after it had been debated in Council what An&s;wer to return) &s;ent him word in writing, &startq;that the King had allways been, and would be &s;till ready to receive any Petition from his two Hou&s;es of Parliament; and if the Earl had any &s;uch to be pre&s;ented, if he &s;ent it by any Per&s;ons, who &s;tood not Per&s;onally accu&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty of High Trea&s;on, and ex|cepted &s;pecially in all offers of Pardon made by him, the Per&s;ons who brought it &s;hould be welcome; and the King would return &s;uch an&endq; An&s;wer to it, as &s;hould be agreeable to Honour, and Ju&s;tice.</Q> Whether <MILESTONE N="20"> this limitation as to Me&s;&s;engers di&s;plea&s;ed them (as it was afterwards &s;aid, that the Me&s;&s;engers appointed to have deliver'd it were the Lord <HI>Mandevil,</HI> and M^r <HI>Hambden,</HI> who, they thought, would have skill to make infu&s;ions into many Per&s;ons then about his Maje&s;ty; <Q>and the hopes of that acce&s;s being barred by that limitation, and exception, they would not &s;end any other) or what other rea&s;on &s;oever there was, the King heard no more of this Petition, or any Addre&s;s of that Nature, till he found, by &s;ome new printed Votes, and Declarations, &startq;that he was guilty of another breach of the Priviledge of Parliament, for having refu&s;ed to receive their Petition, except it were pre&s;ented in &s;uch a <MILESTONE N="30"> manner as He pre&s;cribed: Whereas They alone were Judges in what manner, and by what Per&s;ons their own Petitions &s;hould be deliver'd,&endq; and he ought &s;o to receive them.</Q> So that Petition which is before &s;et down in the very terms it pa&s;s'd both Hou&s;es, was never deliver'd to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THERE cannot be too often mention of the wonderful Providence <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The &s;trength of the King's Army at</HI> Shrewsbury.</NOTE> of God, that from that low de&s;pi&s;ed condition the King was in at <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> after the &s;etting up his Standard, he &s;hould be able to get Men, Money, or Armes, &s;o that, within twenty days after his coming to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> he re&s;olv'd to march, in de&s;pight of the Enemy, even <MILESTONE N="40"> towards <HI>London;</HI> his Foot, by this time, con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ix thou|&s;and; and his Hor&s;e of two thou&s;and; his Train in very good order, commanded by S^r <HI>John Heydon.</HI> And though this &s;trength was much inferior to the Enemy, yet as it was greater than any Man thought po&s;|&s;ible to be rai&s;ed, &s;o all thought it &s;ufficient to encounter the Rebels. Be&s;ides that it was confidently believ'd (and not without &s;ome grounds, upon corre&s;pondence with &s;ome Officers in the other Army) that, a&s;&s;oon as the Armies came within any rea&s;onable di&s;tance of each other, very many Soldiers would leave their Colours, and come to the King; which expectation was confirm'd by divers Soldiers, who every day dropped <MILESTONE N="50"> in from tho&s;e Forces; and, to make them&s;elves welcome, told many Stories of their Fellow's re&s;olutions, whom they had left behind.</P>
<P>AND this mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that either by the care and diligence of
<PB N="31" REF="470">
the Officers, or by the good inclinations, and temper of the Soldiers them&s;elves, the Army was in &s;o good order and di&s;cipline, that, during the King's &s;tay at <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> there was not any remarkable di&s;order; the Country being very kind to the Soldiers, and the Soldiers ju&s;t, and regardful to the Country. And by the free Loans, and Contributions of the Gentlemen, and Sub&s;tantial Inhabitants, but e&s;pecially by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Nobility, who attended, the Army was &s;o well paid, that there was not the lea&s;t mutiny or di&s;content for want of pay; nor was there any cau&s;e; for they &s;eldom failed every week, never went above a fortnight unpaid. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE greate&s;t difficulty was to provide Armes; of which indeed there was a wonderful &s;carcity, the King being exceedingly di&s;appointed in his expectation of Armes from <HI>Holland;</HI> a Ve&s;&s;el or two having been taken by his own Ships, under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> &s;o that, except eight hundred Mu&s;quets, five hundred pair of Pi&s;tols, and two hundred Swords, which came with the Powder, landed in <HI>York|&s;hire,</HI> as is before mention'd, the King had none in his Magazine; &s;o that he was compell'd to begin at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and &s;o in all places as he pa&s;&s;ed, to borrow the Armes from the Train'd-bands; which was done with &s;o much warine&s;s and caution (albeit it was kno$n that tho&s;e Armes <MILESTONE N="20"> would, being left in tho&s;e hands, be imployed again&s;t him, or at lea&s;t be of no u&s;e to him) that it was done rather with their con&s;ent, than by any con&s;traint, and allways with the full approbation of their Commanders. And therefore in <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> where the Gentlemen very unskilfully, though with good meaning, de&s;ired that the Armes might &s;till be left in the Country Men's hands, there was none of that kind of borrowing. But, in all places, the Noblemen, and Gentlemen of Quality, &s;ent the King &s;uch &s;upplies of Armes, out of their own Armories (which were very mean) &s;o that by all tho&s;e Means together, the Foot, all but three or four hundred, who marched with|out <MILESTONE N="30"> any Weapon but a Cudgel, were Arm'd with Mu&s;quets, and Bags for their Powder, and Pikes; but, in the whole Body, there was not a Pikeman had a Cor&s;let, and very few Mu&s;queteers who had Swords. Among the Hor&s;e, the Officers had their full de&s;ire, if they were able to procure old Backs, and Brea&s;ts, and Pots with Pi&s;tols, or Carabines, for their two or three fir&s;t Ranks, and Swords for the re&s;t; them&s;elves (and &s;ome Soldiers by their examples) having gotten, be&s;ides their Pi&s;tols and Swords, a &s;hort Pole-Ax.</P>
<P>THE Foot were divided into three Brigades; the fir&s;t commanded by S^r <HI>Nicholas Byron,</HI> the &s;econd by Colonel <HI>Harry Wentworth,</HI> the <MILESTONE N="40"> third by Colonel <HI>Richard Fielding,</HI> S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hley</HI> being Major Gene|ral, and commanding the Foot immediately under the General. For, though General <HI>Ruthen,</HI> who came to the King &s;ome few days before he left <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> was made Field Mar&s;hal, yet he kept wholely with the Hor&s;e to a&s;&s;i&s;t Prince <HI>Rupert:</HI> And S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton,</HI> of who&s;e Sol|diery there was a very great e&s;teem, was made Colonel General of the Dragoons; which at that time, though con&s;i&s;ting of two or three Regi|ments, were not above eight hundred, or a thou&s;and at the mo&s;t. Mo&s;t of the Per&s;ons of Quality, except tho&s;e who&s;e attendance was near the King's own Per&s;on, put them&s;elves into the King's Troop of Guards, <MILESTONE N="50"> commanded by the Lord <HI>Bernard Stewart;</HI> and made indeed &s;o gal|lant a Body, that, upon very mode&s;t computation, the E&s;tate, and Re|venue of that &s;ingle Troop, it was thought, might ju&s;tly be valued at
<PB N="32" REF="480">

Their Servants, under the command of S^r <HI>William Kil|ligrew,</HI> made another full Troop, and allways marched with their Lords and Ma&s;ters.</P>
<P>IN this equipage the King marched from <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> on the 12^t^h of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King $$$$ing form'd an Army marches from</HI> Shrewsbury <HI>towards</HI> Lon|don.</NOTE> <HI>October</HI> to <HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> never le&s;s baggage attending a Royal Army, there being not one Tent, and very few Waggons belonging to the whole Train; having in his whole Army not one Officer of the Field who was a Papi&s;t, except S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton,</HI> if He were one; and very few com|mon <MILESTONE N="10"> Soldiers of that Religion. <Q>However the Parliament, in all their Declarations, and their Clergy much more in their Sermons, a&s;&s;ured the People, &startq;&endq;that the King's Army con&s;i&s;ted only of Papi&s;ts, whil&s;t them&s;elves entertain'd all of that Religion, that they could get;</Q> and very many, both Officers and Soldiers, of that Religion engaged with them; whether it was that they really believ'd, that that Army did de|&s;ire Liberty of Con&s;cience for all Religions, as &s;ome of the chief of them pretended, or that they de&s;ired to divide them&s;elves for communication of Intelligence, and Intere&s;t. <Q>And here it is not fit to forget one parti|cular, that, when the Committee of Parliament appointed to advance <MILESTONE N="20"> the &s;ervice upon the Propo&s;ition for Plate, and Hor&s;es, in the County of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> &s;ent word to the Hou&s;e of Commons, &startq;that &s;ome Papi&s;ts offer'd to lend Money upon tho&s;e Propo&s;itions, and de&s;ired advice whether&endq; they &s;hould accept of it, it was An&s;wer'd,</Q> <Q>&startq;that if they offer'd any con&s;iderable Sum, whereby it might be conceiv'd to proceed from a real affection to the Parliament, and not out of Policy to bring them|&s;elves within their Protection, and &s;o to excu&s;e their Delinquency, it&endq; &s;hould be accepted of.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the King was ready for his march, there was &s;ome difference of opinion which way he &s;hould take; many were of opinion that he <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;hould march towards <HI>Worcester,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;till remain'd; tho&s;e Countries were thought well affected to the King; where his Ar|my would be &s;upplied with provi&s;ions, and encrea&s;ed in Numbers; and that no time &s;hould be lo&s;t in coming to a Battle; becau&s;e the longer it was deferred, the &s;tronger the Earl would grow, by the &s;upplies which were every day &s;ent to him from <HI>London;</HI> and he had &s;tore of Armes with him to &s;upply all defects of that kind. However it was thought more coun&s;ellable to march directly towards <HI>London,</HI> it being morally &s;ure, that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> would put him&s;elf in their way. The King had much confidence in his Hor&s;e (his Nephew Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> being in <MILESTONE N="40"> the head of them) which were fle&s;hed by their &s;ucce&s;s at <HI>Worcester;</HI> and if he had made his march that way, he would have been entangled in the inclo&s;ures, where his Hor&s;e would have been le&s;s u&s;eful; whereas there were many open grounds near the other way, much fitter for an Engagement. And &s;o, about the middle of <HI>October,</HI> the King march'd from <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and quarter'd that night at <HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> ten Miles from the other place, where there was a Rendezvous of the whole Ar|my, which appear'd very cheaful; and thence to <HI>Wolverhampton, Bro|micham,</HI> and <HI>Killingworth,</HI> a Hou&s;e of the Kings, and a very noble Seat, where the King re&s;ted one day; where the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Heath,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> who was made Chief Ju&s;tice for that purpo&s;e <HI>(Bramston,</HI> a Man of great Learning and Integrity, being, without any purpo&s;e of disfavour, re|moved from that Office, becau&s;e he &s;tood bound by Recognizance to

<P>SOME days had pa&s;&s;ed without any notice of that Army; &s;ome re|porting that it remain'd &s;till at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> others, that they were march'd the direct way from thence towards <HI>London.</HI> <Q>But Intelligence came from <HI>London,</HI> &startq;that very many Officers of Name, and Command in the Parliament Army, had undergone that &s;ervice with a full re&s;olu|tion to come to the King a&s;&s;oon as they were within any di&s;tance; and <MILESTONE N="10"> it was wi&s;h'd, that the King would &s;end a Proclamation into the Ar|my it &s;elf, and to offer pardon to all who would return to their obe|dience.&endq;</Q> A Proclamation was prepared accordingly, and all circum|&s;tances re&s;olv'd upon, that a Herald &s;hould be &s;ent to proclaim it in the Head of the Earls Army, when it &s;hould be drawn up in Battle. But that, and many other particulars, prepared and re&s;olved upon, were forgotten, or omitted at the time appointed, which would not admit any of tho&s;e formalities.</P>
<P>WHEN the whole Army marched together, there was quickly di&s;co|ver'd <NOTE PLACE="marg">Faction begun in the Kings Army.</NOTE> an unhappy jealou&s;y, and divi&s;ion between the pri$$ipal Officers, <MILESTONE N="20"> which grew quickly into a perfect Faction between the $oot and the Hor&s;e. The Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> was General of the whole Army by his Commi&s;&s;ion, and thought very equal to it. But when Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> came to the King, which was after the Standard was &s;et up, and receiv'd a Commi&s;&s;ion to be General of the Hor&s;e, which, all Men knew, was de&s;ign'd for him, there was a clau&s;e in&s;erted into it, exempting him from receiving Orders from any Body but from the King him&s;elf; which, upon the matter, &s;eparated all the Hor&s;e from any dependence upon the General, and had other ill con&s;equences in it: for when the King at midnight, being in his Bed, and receiving Intelligence of the Enemies motion, <MILESTONE N="30"> commanded the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> his principal Secretary of State, to direct Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> what he &s;hould do, his Highne&s;s took it very ill, and expo&s;tulated with the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> for giving him Orders. He could not have directed his pa&s;&s;ion again&s;t any Man, who would feel or regard it le&s;s. <Q>He told him, &startq;that it was his office to &s;ignify what the King bid him; which he &s;hould allways do; and that his Highne&s;s,&endq; in neglecting it, neglected the King;</Q> who did neither the Prince, nor his own &s;ervice any good, by complying in the beginning with his rough Nature. But the King was &s;o indulgent to him, that he took his advice in all things relating to the Army, and upon the deliberation of their <MILESTONE N="40"> march, and the figure of the Battle they re&s;olv'd to fight in with the Enemy, he concurr'd entirely with Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s advice, rejecting the opinion of the General, who prefer'd the order he had learn'd under Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and Prince <HI>Harry,</HI> with whom he had &s;erv'd at the &s;ame time, when the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and he, both of them, had Regiments. The re&s;ervedne&s;s of the Princes Nature, and the little education he then had in Courts, made him unapt to make acquaintance with any of the Lords, who were thereby likewi&s;e di&s;couraged from applying them&s;elves to Him; whil&s;t &s;ome Officers of the Hor&s;e were well plea&s;ed to ob&s;erve that &s;trangene&s;s, and fomented it; believing Their credit would be the <MILESTONE N="50"> greater with the Prince, and de&s;iring that no other Per&s;on &s;hould have any credit with the King. So the War was &s;carce begun, when there appeared &s;uch Faction and De&s;igns in the Army, which wi&s;e Men look'd

upon as a very evil Prefage; and the inconveniencies, which flow'd from thence, gave the King great trouble in a &s;hort time after.</P>
<P>WITHIN two days after the King marched from <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>marches after the King.</HI></NOTE> Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> moved from <HI>Worcester</HI> to attend him, with an Army far Superior in Number to the Kings; the Hor&s;e and Foot being complete|ly arm'd, and the Men very well exerci&s;ed, and the whole equipage (be|ing &s;upplied out of the King's Magazines) &s;uitable to an Army &s;et forth at the charge of a Kingdom. The Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> had the Name of General of the Hor&s;e, though that Command principally depended upon S^r <HI>William Balfour.</HI> Of the Nobility he had with him the Lords <HI>Kim|bolton,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>Saint Johns, Wharton, Robarts,</HI> and the Lords <HI>Rochford,</HI> and <HI>Feilding</HI> (who&s;e Fathers, the Earls of <HI>Dover,</HI> and <HI>Denbigh,</HI> charged as Voluntiers in the King's Guards of Hor&s;e) and many Gentlemen of Qua|lity; but his Train was &s;o very great, that he could move but in &s;low marches. So that the two Armies, though they were but twenty miles a&s;under, when they fir&s;t &s;et forth, and both marched the &s;ame way, gave not the lea&s;t di&s;quiet in ten days march to each other; and in truth, as it appear'd afterwards, neither Army knew where the other was.</P>
<P>THE King by quick marches, having &s;eldom re&s;ted a day in any place, came, on <HI>Saturday</HI> the 22^d of <HI>October,</HI> to <HI>Edgcot</HI> a Village in <HI>Northam|pton-&s;hire,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> within four Miles of <HI>Banbury,</HI> in which the Rebels had a Garri&s;on. <Q>A&s;&s;oon as he came thither he called a Council of War, and having no Intelligence that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was within any di&s;tance, it was re&s;olv'd, &startq;the King and the Army &s;hould re&s;t in tho&s;e Quarters the next day, only that S^r <HI>Nicholas Byron</HI> &s;hould march with his Bri|gade,&endq; and attempt the taking in of <HI>Banbury.</HI></Q> With this Re&s;olution the Council Broke up, and all Men went to their Quarters, which were at a great di&s;tance, without any apprehen&s;ion of an Enemy. <Q>But that night, about twelve of the Clock, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> &s;ent the King word, &startq;that the Body of the Rebel's Army was within &s;even or eight Miles, <MILESTONE N="30"> and that the head Quarter was at a Village call'd <HI>Keinton</HI> on the Edge of <HI>Warwick-&s;hire;</HI> and that it would be in his Maje&s;ties power, if he&endq; thought fit, to fight a Battle the next day;</Q> <Q>which his Maje&s;ty liked well, and therefore immediately di&s;patched Orders to cro&s;s the de&s;ign for <HI>Banbury,</HI> &startq;&endq;and that the whole Army &s;hould draw to a Rendezvous on the top of <HI>Edge-hill;</HI></Q> which was a high Hill about two Miles from <HI>Keinton,</HI> where the head Quarter of the Earl was, which had a clear pro&s;pect of all that Valley.</P>
<P>IN the morning being <HI>Sunday</HI> the 23^d of <HI>October,</HI> when the Rebels <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battle of</HI> Keinton <HI>or</HI> Edge-hill.</NOTE> were beginning their March (for they &s;u&s;pected not the King's Forces to be near) they perceived a fair Body of Hor&s;e on the top of that Hill, and ea&s;ily concluded their march was not then to be far. It is certain they were exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed, having never had any other confidence of their Men, than by the di&s;parity they concluded would be &s;till be|tween Their Numbers, and the Kings, the which they found them&s;elves now deceiv'd in. For two of their &s;tronge&s;t and be&s;t Regiments of Foot, and one Regiment of Hor&s;e, was a days march behind with their Am|munition. So that, though they were &s;till &s;uperior in Number, yet that difference was not &s;o great as they promi&s;ed them&s;elves. However it cannot be denied that the Earl, with great dexterity, perform'd what|&s;oever could be expected from a Wi&s;e General. He cho&s;e that ground which be&s;t liked him. There was between the Hill and the Town a fair Campaigne, &s;ave that near the Town it was narrower, and on the right
<PB N="35" REF="520">
hand &s;ome Hedges, and Inclo&s;ures: &s;o that there he placed Mu&s;queteers, and not above two Regiments of Hor&s;e, where the ground was nar|rowe&s;t; but on his left Wing he placed a Body of a thou&s;and Hor&s;e, commanded by one <HI>Ram&s;ey</HI> a <HI>Scotch-</HI>man; the Re&s;erve of Hor&s;e, which was a good one, was commanded by the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> General of their Hor&s;e, and S^r <HI>William Balfour</HI> with him. The General Him&s;elf was with the Foot, which were order'd as much to advantage as might be. And in this po&s;ture they &s;tood from eight of the Clock in the morning.</P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, though Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was early in the morning <MILESTONE N="10"> with the greate&s;t part of the Hor&s;e on the top of the Hill, which gave the Enemy the fir&s;t Alarm of the nece&s;&s;ity of fighting, yet the Foot were quarter'd at &s;o great a di&s;tance, that many Regiments marched &s;even or eight Miles to the Rendezvous: &s;o that it was pa&s;t one of the Clock, before the King's Forces marched down the Hill; the General him&s;elf alighted at the head of his own Regiment of Foot, his Son the Lord <HI>Willoughby</HI> being next to him, with the King's Regiment of Guards, in which was the King's Standard carried by S^r <HI>Edmund Verney,</HI> Knight Mar&s;hal. The King's right Wing of Hor&s;e was Comma$$ed by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the left Wing by M^r <HI>Wilmot</HI> Commi&s;&s;ary General of the Hor&s;e, <MILESTONE N="20"> who was a&s;&s;i&s;ted by S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton</HI> with mo&s;t of the Dragoons, becau&s;e that left Wing was oppo&s;ed to the Enemies right, which had the &s;hel|ter of &s;ome Hedges lined with Mu&s;queteers: and the Re&s;erve was com|mitted to S^r <HI>John Byron,</HI> and con&s;i&s;ted indeed only of his own Regiment. At the entrance into the Field, the King's Troop of Guards, either pro|voked by &s;ome un&s;ea&s;onable Scoffs among the Soldiery, or out of de&s;ire of Glory, or both, be&s;ought the King, <Q>&startq;that he would give them leave to be ab&s;ent that day from his Per&s;on, and to charge in the Front&endq; among the Hor&s;e, the which his Maje&s;ty con&s;ented to.</Q> <Q>They de&s;ired Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> &startq;&endq;to give them that honour which belonged to them;</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"> who accordingly a&s;&s;ign'd them the fir&s;t place; which, though they per|form'd their parts with admirable Courage, may well be reckon'd among the over&s;ights of that day.</P>
<P>IT was near three of the Clock in the afternoon, before the Battle begun; <Q>which, at that time of the year, was &s;o late, that &s;ome were of opinion, &startq;&endq;that the bu&s;ine&s;s &s;hould be deferr'd till the next day.</Q> <Q>But again&s;t that there were many objections; &startq;the King's Numbers could&endq; not encrea&s;e, the Enemies might;</Q> for they had not only their Garri|&s;ons, <HI>Warwick, Coventry,</HI> and <HI>Banbury</HI> within di&s;tance, but all that Country &s;o devoted to them, that they had all provi&s;ions brought to <MILESTONE N="40"> them, without the lea&s;t trouble; whereas, on the other &s;ide, the Peo|ple were &s;o di&s;affected to the King's Party, that they had carried away, or hid all their Provi&s;ions, in&s;omuch as there was neither Meat for Man, or Hor&s;e; and the very Smiths hid them&s;elves, that they might not be compell'd to &s;hooe Hor&s;es, of which in tho&s;e &s;tony ways there was great need. This proceeded not from any radical malice, or di&s;affection to the King's Cau&s;e, or his Per&s;on, though it is true, that circuit in which this Battle was fought, being very much in the Intere&s;t of the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Brooke,</HI> was the mo&s;t eminently corrupted of any Coun|ty in <HI>England;</HI> but by the reports, and infu&s;ions which the other very <MILESTONE N="50"> diligent Party had wrought into the Peoples belief; <Q>&startq;that the Cavaliers were of a fierce, bloody, and licentious di&s;po&s;ition, and that they com|mitted all manner of cruelty upon the Inhabitants of tho&s;e places
<PB N="36" REF="530">
&endq; where they came, of which, robbery was the lea&s;t:</Q> &s;o that the poor people thought there was no other way to pre&s;erve their goods, than by hiding them out of the way; which was confe&s;s'd by them, when they found how much that information had wronged them, by making them &s;o injurious to their Friends. And therefore where the Army re&s;ted a day they found much better entertainment at parting, than when they came; for it will not be denied, that there was no Per&s;on of Honour or Quality, who paid not punctually and exactly for what they had; and there was not the lea&s;t violence or di&s;order among the Common Sol|diers in their march, which &s;caped exemplary puni&s;hment, &s;o that at <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>Bromicham,</HI> a Town &s;o generally wicked, that it had ri&s;en upon &s;mall parties of the Kings, and kill'd, or taken them Pri&s;oners, and &s;ent them to <HI>Coventry,</HI> declaring a more peremptory malice to his Maje&s;ty than any other place, two Soldiers were executed, for having taken &s;ome &s;mall trifle of no value out of a Hou&s;e, who&s;e owner was at that time in the Rebels Army. So &s;trict was the di&s;cipline in this Army; when the other, without controul, practi&s;ed all the di&s;&s;olutene&s;s imaginable. But the march was &s;o fa&s;t, that the leaving a good reputation behind them, was no Harbinger to provide for their better reception in the next Quarters. So that their wants were &s;o great, at the time when they <MILESTONE N="20"> came to <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> that there were very many Companies of the Com|mon Soldiers, who had &s;carce eaten Bread in eight and forty hours be|fore. The only way to cure this was a Victory; and therefore the King gave the Word, though it was late, the Enemy keeping their ground to receive him without advancing at all.</P>
<P>IN this hurry, there was an omi&s;&s;ion of &s;omewhat, which the King intended to have executed before the beginning of the Battle. He had cau&s;ed many Proclamations to be printed of Pardon to all tho&s;e Soldiers who would lay down their Armes, which he re&s;olv'd, as is &s;aid before, to have &s;ent by a Herald to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and to have found ways <MILESTONE N="30"> to have &s;catter'd, and di&s;pers'd them in that Army, a&s;&s;oon as he under|&s;tood they were within any di&s;tance of him. But all Men were now &s;o much otherwi&s;e bu&s;ied, that it was not &s;oon enough remember'd; and when it was, the Proclamations were not at hand; which, by that which follows, might probably have produced a good effect. For as the right Wing of the King's Hor&s;e advanced to Charge the left Wing, which was the gro&s;s of the Enemies Hor&s;e, S^r <HI>Faithful Forte&s;cue</HI> (who, having his Fortune and Intere&s;t in <HI>Ireland,</HI> was come out of that Kingdom to ha&s;ten &s;upplies thither, and had a Troop of Hor&s;e rai&s;ed for him for that Ser|vice, but as many other of tho&s;e Forces were, &s;o his Troop was like|wi&s;e <MILESTONE N="40"> di&s;po&s;ed into that Army, and he was now Major to S^r <HI>William Waller;</HI> He) with his whole Troop advanced from the gro&s;s of their Hor&s;e, and di&s;charging all their Pi&s;tols on the ground, within little more than Carabine &s;hot of his own Body, pre&s;ented Him&s;elf, and his Troop to Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> and immediately, with his Highne&s;s, charged the Enemy. Whether this &s;uddain Accident, as it might very well, and the not knowing how many more were of the &s;ame mind, each Man looking upon his Companion with the &s;ame apprehen&s;ion as upon the Enemy, or whether the terror of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and the King's Hor&s;e, or all together, with their own evil Con&s;ciences, wrought upon them, <MILESTONE N="50"> I know not, but that whole Wing, having unskilfully di&s;charg'd their Carabines and Pi&s;tols into the Air, wheeled about, the King's Hor&s;e charging in the flank and rear, and having thus ab&s;olutely routed them,
<PB N="37" REF="540">
pur&s;ued them flying; and had the execution of them above two Miles.</P>
<P>THE left Wing, commanded by M^r <HI>Wilmot,</HI> had as good &s;ucce&s;s, though they were to charge in wor&s;e ground, among hedges, and through gaps and ditches, which were lined with Mu&s;queteers. But S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton,</HI> with great Courage and Dexterity, beat off tho&s;e Mu&s;queteers with his Dragoons; and then the right Wing of their Hor&s;e was as ea&s;i|ly routed and di&s;per&s;ed as their left, and tho&s;e follow'd the cha&s;e as fu|riou&s;ly as the other. The Re&s;erve &s;eeing none of the Enemies Hor&s;e left, thought there was nothing more to be done, but to pur&s;ue tho&s;e that fled; and could not be contain'd by their Commanders; but with Spurs, <MILESTONE N="10"> and loo&s;e Rains follow'd the cha&s;e, which their left Wing had led them. And by this means, whil&s;t mo&s;t Men thought the Victory unque&s;tion|able, the King was in danger of the &s;ame fate which his Predece&s;&s;or, <HI>Henry</HI> the third, had at the Battle of <HI>Lewes</HI> again&s;t his Barons; when his Son the Prince, having routed their Hor&s;e, follow'd the cha&s;e &s;o far, that, before his return to the field, his Father was taken Pri&s;oner; and &s;o his Victory &s;erv'd only to make the misfortunes of that day the more intolerable. For all the King's Hor&s;e having thus left the Field, many of them only following the execution, others intending t$$ Spoil in the Town of <HI>Keinton,</HI> where all the Baggage was, and the $$rl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s <MILESTONE N="20"> own Coach, which was taken, and brought away; their Re&s;erve, com|manded by S^r <HI>William Balfour,</HI> moved up and down the field in good Order, and marching towards the King's Foot pretended to be Friends, till ob&s;erving no Hor&s;e to be in readine&s;s to charge them, they brake in upon the Foot, and did great execution. Then was the General the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> in the head of his Regiment, being on Foot, &s;hot in the thigh; with which he fell, and was pre&s;ently encompa&s;s'd with the Enemy; and his Son, the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> piou&s;ly endeavouring the re&s;cue of his Father, taken Pri&s;oner with him. Then was the Standard taken (S^r <HI>Edmund Verney,</HI> who bore it, being kill'd) but re&s;cued again <MILESTONE N="30"> by Captain <HI>John Smith,</HI> an Officer of the Lord <HI>Grandi&s;ons</HI> Regiment of Hor&s;e, and by him brought off. And if tho&s;e Hor&s;e had be&s;tirred them&s;elves, they might with little difficulty have de&s;troyed, or taken Pri&s;oner the King Him&s;elf, and his two Sons, the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> being with fewer than one hundred Hor&s;e, and tho&s;e without Officer or Command, within half Mu&s;quet &s;hot of that Body, before he &s;u&s;pected them to be Enemies.</P>
<P>WHEN Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> return'd from the cha&s;e, he found this great alteration in the field, and his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf with few Noblemen, and a &s;mall retinue about him, and the hope of &s;o glorious a day quite <MILESTONE N="40"> vani&s;h'd. For though mo&s;t of the Officers of Hor&s;e were return'd, and that part of the field cover'd again with the loo&s;e Troops, yet they could not be per&s;waded, or drawn to charge either the Enemies Re&s;erve of Hor&s;e, which alone kept the field, or the Body of their Foot, which only kept their ground. <Q>The Officers pretending, &startq;that their Soldiers&endq; were &s;o di&s;per&s;ed, that there were not ten of any Troop together;</Q> <Q>and the Soldiers, &startq;that their Hor&s;es were &s;o tired, that they could not&endq; charge.</Q> But the truth is, where many Soldiers of one Troop or Regi|ment were rallied together, there the Officers were wanting; and where the Officers were ready, there the Soldiers were not together; and nei|ther <MILESTONE N="50"> Officers, nor Soldiers de&s;ired to move without tho&s;e who properly belonged to them. Things had now &s;o ill an a&s;pect, that many were of opinion, that the King &s;hould leave the field, though it was not ea&s;y

to advi&s;e whither he &s;hould have gone; which if he had done, he had left an ab&s;olute Victory to tho&s;e, who even at this time thought them|&s;elves overcome. But the King was po&s;itive again&s;t this advice, well knowing, that as that Army was rai&s;ed by his Per&s;on and Pre&s;ence only, &s;o it could by no other means be kept together; and he thought it Un|princely, to for&s;ake Them who had for&s;aken all they had to &s;erve him: Be&s;ides, he ob&s;erv'd the other &s;ide look'd not as if they thought them|&s;elves Conquerors; for that Re&s;erve, which did &s;o much mi&s;chief be|fore, &s;ince the return of his Hor&s;e, betook them&s;elves to a fixt &s;tation between their Foot, which at be&s;t could but be thought to &s;tand their <MILESTONE N="10"> ground, which two Brigades of the Kings did with equal Courage, and gave equal Vollies; and therefore he tryed all po&s;&s;ible ways to get the Hor&s;e to charge again; ea&s;ily di&s;cerning, by &s;ome little attempts which were made, what a notable impre&s;&s;ion a brisk one would have made upon the Enemy. And when he &s;aw it was not to be done, he was con|tent with their only &s;tanding &s;till. Without doubt if either Party had known the con&s;titution of the other, they had not parted &s;o fairly; and, very probably, which &s;oever had made a bold offer, had compa&s;s'd his end upon his Enemy. This made many believe, though the Hor&s;e vaunted them&s;elves aloud to have done Their part, that the good for|tune <MILESTONE N="20"> of the fir&s;t part of the day, which well managed would have &s;ecured the re&s;t, was to be imputed rather to their Enemies want of Courage, than to their own Virtue (which after &s;o great a Victory, could not &s;o &s;oon have for&s;aken them) and to the &s;uddain and unexpected revolt of S^r <HI>Faithful Forte&s;cue</HI> with a whole Troop, no doubt much to the con|&s;ternation of tho&s;e he left; though they had not &s;o good Fortune as they de&s;erv'd; for by the negligence of not throwing away their Orange Tawny Scarfs, which they all wore as the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex</HI>'s colours, and being immediately engaged in the charge, many of them, not fewer than &s;eventeen or eighteen, were &s;uddainly kill'd by tho&s;e to whom they <MILESTONE N="30"> joyn'd them&s;elves.</P>
<P>IN this doubt of all &s;ides, the Night, the Common friend to wearied and di&s;maied Armies, parted them; and then the King cau&s;ed his Can|non, which were neare&s;t the Enemies, to be drawn off; and with his whole Forces him&s;elf &s;pent the night in the field, by &s;uch a fire, as could be made of the little wood, and bu&s;hes which grew thereabouts, unre&s;olv'd what to do the next morning; <Q>many reporting, &startq;that the&endq; Enemy was gone;</Q> but when the day appear'd, the contrary was di&s;|cover'd; for then they were &s;een &s;tanding in the &s;ame po&s;ture, and place in which they fought, from whence the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> wi&s;ely never &s;uf|fer'd <MILESTONE N="40"> them to &s;tir all that Night; pre&s;uming rea&s;onably, that if they were drawn off never &s;o little from that place, their Numbers would le&s;&s;en, and that many would run away; and therefore he cau&s;ed all man|ner of provi&s;ions, with which the Country &s;upplied him plentifully, to be brought thither to them for their refre&s;hment, and repo&s;ed him&s;elf with them in the place; be&s;ides, that Night he receiv'd a great addition of &s;trength, not only by rallying tho&s;e Hor&s;e, and Foot, which had run out of the field in the Battle, but by the arrival of Colonel <HI>Hambden,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Grantham</HI> with two thou&s;and fre&s;h Foot (which were reckon'd among the be&s;t of the Army) and five hundred Hor&s;e, which <MILESTONE N="50"> marched a day behind the Army for the Guard of their Ammunition, and a great part of their Train, not &s;uppo&s;ing there would have been any Action that would have required their pre&s;ence.

this &s;ea&s;onable Recruit brought them, was to give their old Men &s;o much Courage as to keep the field, which it was otherwi&s;e believ'd, they would hardly have been per&s;waded to have done. In the other Army, after a very cold Night &s;pent in the field, without any refre&s;hment of Victual, or Provi&s;ion for the Soldiers (for the Country was &s;o di&s;affect|ed, that it not only not &s;ent in Provi&s;ions, but Soldiers, who &s;tragled into the Villages for relief, were knocked in the head by the Common People) The King found his Troops very thin; for though by conference with the Officers, he might rea&s;onably conclude, that there were not many &s;lain in the Battle, yet a third part of his Foot were not upon the <MILESTONE N="10"> place, and of the Hor&s;e many mi&s;&s;ing; and they that were in the field were &s;o tired with duty, and weaken'd with want of meat, and &s;hrunk up with the cruel cold of the Night (for it was a terrible Fro&s;t, and there was no &s;helter of either Tree or Hedge) that though they had rea|&s;on to believe, by the &s;tanding &s;till of the Enemy, whil&s;t a &s;mall Party of the King's Hor&s;e, in the morning, took away four pieces of their Can|non very near them, that any offer towards a charge, or but marching towards them, would have made a notable impre&s;&s;ion in them, yet there was &s;o vi&s;ible an aver&s;ne&s;s from it in mo&s;t Officers, as well as Sol|diers, that the King thought not fit to make the attempt; $ut contented <MILESTONE N="20"> him&s;elf to keep his Men in Order, the Body of Hor&s;e facing the Enemy upon the field where they had fought.</P>
<P>TOWARDS Noon the King re&s;olv'd to try that expedient, which was prepared for the day before; and &s;ent S^r <HI>William le Neve,</HI> Claren|cieux King at Armes, to the Enemy, with his Proclamation of Par|don to &s;uch as would lay down Armes; believing, though he expected then little benefit by the Proclamation, that he &s;hould, by that means, receive &s;ome adverti&s;ement of the condition of the Army, and what Pri&s;oners they had taken (for many Per&s;ons of Command and Quality were wanting) giving him order likewi&s;e to de&s;ire to &s;peak with the <MILESTONE N="30"> Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> who was known to be in their hands. Before S^r <HI>Wil|liam</HI> came to the Army, he was receiv'd by the out Guards, and con|ducted, with &s;trictne&s;s (that he might &s;ay, or publi&s;h nothing among the Soldiers) to the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex;</HI> who, when he offer'd to read the Pro|clamation aloud, and to deliver the effect of it, that he might be heard by tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent, rebuked him, with &s;ome roughne&s;s, <Q>and charged him, &startq;as he lov'd his life, not to pre&s;ume to &s;peak a word&endq; to the Soldiers; and after &s;ome few que&s;tions, &s;ent him pre&s;ently back well guarded through the Army, without any An&s;wer at all.</Q> At his re|turn he had &s;o great and feeling a &s;en&s;e of the danger he had pa&s;&s;ed, that <MILESTONE N="40"> he made little ob&s;ervation of the Po&s;ture or Numbers of the Enemy. Only he &s;eem'd to have &s;een, or apprehended &s;o much trouble and di&s;|order in the faces of the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex,</HI> and the principal Officers about him, and &s;o much dejection in the common Soldiers, that they look'd like Men who had no farther Ambition, than to keep what they had left. He brought word of the death of the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey;</HI> who, be|ing carried out of the field a Pri&s;oner, into a Barn of the next Village, for want of a Surgeon, and &s;uch accommodations as were nece&s;&s;ary, within few hours died with the lo&s;s of Blood, his wound not being otherwi&s;e Mortal or dangerous. This was imputed to the inhumanity <MILESTONE N="50"> of the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex,</HI> as if he had purpo&s;ely neglected, or inhibited the performing any nece&s;&s;ary offices to him, out of the In&s;olence of his Na|ture, and in revenge of &s;ome former unkindne&s;&s;es, which had pa&s;s'd

between them. But, I pre&s;ume, it may be with more ju&s;tice attributed to the hurry, and di&s;traction of that &s;ea&s;on, when, being &s;o un&s;ecure of their Friends, they had no thoughts vacant for their Enemies. For it is not to be denied at the time when the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> was taken Pri|&s;oner, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> thought him&s;elf in more danger; and among his faults want of Civility and Curte&s;y was none.</P>
<P>THE Number of the &s;lain, by the te&s;timony of the Mini&s;ters, and others of the next Pari&s;h, who took care of the Burying of the Dead, and which was the only computation that could be made, amounted to above five thou&s;and; whereof two parts were conceiv'd to be of tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="10"> of the Parliament Party, and not above a third part of the Kings. In|deed the lo&s;s of both &s;ides was &s;o great, and &s;o little of triumph ap|pear'd in either, that the Victory could &s;carce be imputed to the One or the Other. Yet the King's keeping the field, and having the &s;poil of it, by which many Per&s;ons of Quality, who had lain wounded in the field were pre&s;erv'd, his pur&s;uing afterwards the &s;ame de&s;ign he had when he was diverted to the Battle, and &s;ucceeding in it (which &s;hall be touch'd anon) were greater En&s;igns of Victory on that &s;ide, than taking the General Pri&s;oner, and the taking the Standard, which was likewi&s;e recover'd, were on the other. Of the Kings the principal Per|&s;ons, <MILESTONE N="20"> who were lo&s;t, were the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> General of the Army, the Lord <HI>Stewart,</HI> Lord <HI>Aubigny</HI> Son to the Duke of <HI>Lenox,</HI> and Bro|ther to the then Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and <HI>Lenox,</HI> S^r <HI>Edmund Verney,</HI> Knight Mar&s;hal of the King's Hor&s;e, and Standard Bearer, and &s;ome others of le&s;s Name, though of great Virtue, and good Quality.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI> was a Man of very noble extraction, and in|herited <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Character of the Earl of</HI> Lind&s;ey, <HI>the King's Gene|ral.</HI></NOTE> a great Fortune from his Ance&s;tors; which though he did not manage with &s;o great care, as if he de&s;ired much to improve, yet he left it in a very fair condition to his Family, which more intended the en|crea&s;e of it. He was a Man of great Honour, and &s;pent his Youth and <MILESTONE N="30"> Vigour of his Age in Military Actions and Commands abroad; and al|beit he indulged to him&s;elf great liberties of Life, yet he &s;till pre&s;erv'd a very good reputation with all Men, and a very great Intere&s;t in his Country, as appear'd by the &s;upplies he, and his Son, brought to the King's Army; the &s;everal Companies of his own Regiment of Foot, being commanded by the principal Knights and Gentlemen of <HI>Lincoln|&s;hire,</HI> who engaged them&s;elves in the &s;ervice principally out of their per|&s;onal affection to Him. He was of a very generous Nature, and pun|ctual in what he undertook, and in exacting what was due to him; which made him bear that re&s;triction &s;o heavily, which was put upon <MILESTONE N="40"> him by the Commi&s;&s;ion granted to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and by the King's preferring the Princes opinion, in all matters relating to the War, be|fore His. <Q>Nor did he conceal his re&s;entment: the day before the Bat|tle, he &s;aid to &s;ome Friends, with whom he had u&s;ed freedom, &startq;that he did not look upon him&s;elf as General; and therefore he was re|&s;olv'd, when the day of Battle &s;hould come, that he would be in the&endq; head of his Regiment as a private Colonel, where he would dye.</Q> He was carried out of the field to the next Village, and if he could then have procured Surgeons, it was thought his wound would not have proved Mortal.

<P>OF the Parliament Party that peri&s;hed, the Lord <HI>Saint Johns</HI> of <HI>Blet|nezo,</HI> and <HI>Charles E&s;sex,</HI> were of the be&s;t Quality. The la&s;t had been bred up a Page under the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex,</HI> who afterwards, at his charge, preferr'd him to a Command in <HI>Holland;</HI> where he liv'd with very good reputation, and pre&s;erv'd the credit of his decayed Family: And a&s;&s;oon as the Earl unfortunately accepted this Command, he thought his gra|titude obliged him to run the fortune of his Patron, and out of pure kindne&s;s to the Per&s;on of the Earl, as many other Gentlemen did, en|gaged <MILESTONE N="40"> him&s;elf again&s;t the King without any malice or Rebellion in his heart towards the Crown. He had the Command of a Regiment of Foot, and was e&s;teem'd the be&s;t and mo&s;t expert Officer of the Army, and was kill'd by a Mu&s;quet &s;hot in the beginning of the Battle. The Lord <HI>Saint Johns</HI> was elde&s;t Son to the Earl of <HI>Bullingbrooke,</HI> and got him&s;elf &s;o well belov'd by the reputation of his Courte&s;y and Civility, which he expre&s;s'd towards all Men, that though his parts of under&s;tanding were very ordinary at be&s;t, and his cour&s;e of life licentious and very much depraved, he got credit enough, by engaging the principal Gentlemen of <HI>Bedford-&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Hertford-&s;hire</HI> to be bound for him, to contract a <MILESTONE N="50"> debt of fifty or three&s;core thou&s;and pounds; for the payment whereof the fortune of the Family was not engaged, nor in his power to engage.

before the Rebellion, he left the Kingdom and fled into <HI>France;</HI> leaving his va&s;t debt to be paid by his Sureties, to the utter ruin of many Fa|milies, and the notable impairing of others. <Q>In the beginning of the Parliament, the King was prevailed with to call him to the Hou&s;e of Peers, his Father being then alive, upon an a&s;&s;urance &startq;that by his pre|&s;ence and liberty, which could by no other way be &s;ecured, means would be found out to pay his debts, and free &s;o many worthy Per|&s;ons from their engagements: Be&s;ides that the times being like to be trouble&s;ome the King might be &s;ure of a faithful Servant, who would&endq; allways advance his &s;ervice in that Hou&s;e.</Q> But the King had very ill <MILESTONE N="10"> fortune in conferring tho&s;e graces, nor was his &s;ervice more pa&s;&s;ionate|ly, and in&s;olently oppo&s;ed by any Men in that Hou&s;e than by tho&s;e, who upon tho&s;e profe&s;&s;ions were advanced by him from the condition of Commoners. And this Gentleman, from the fir&s;t hour of his &s;itting in that Hou&s;e by the King's &s;o extraordinary grace, was never known to concur in any one Vote for the King's Service, that receiv'd any oppo|&s;ition: and, a&s;&s;oon as it was in his power, he receiv'd a Commi&s;&s;ion with the fir&s;t to Command a Troop of Hor&s;e again&s;t him, in which he behaved him&s;elf &s;o ill, that he receiv'd &s;ome wounds in running away; <Q>and being taken Pri&s;oner died before the next morning, without any <MILESTONE N="$0"> other &s;igns of repentance, than the canting words, &startq;that he did not in|tend&endq; to be again&s;t the King, but wi&s;h'd him all happine&s;s:</Q> &s;o great an influence the fir&s;t &s;eeds of his birth had upon his Nature, that how long &s;oever they were conceal'd, and &s;eem'd even buried in a very different breeding and conver&s;ation, they &s;prung up, and bore the &s;ame fruit upon the fir&s;t occa&s;ion. And it was an ob&s;ervation of that time, that the Men of mo&s;t licentious lives, who appear'd to be without any &s;en&s;e of Reli|gion, or reverence to virtue, and the mo&s;t unre&s;train'd by any obliga|tions of con&s;cience, betook them&s;elves to that Party, and pretended an impul&s;e of Religion out of fear of Popery; and on the other &s;ide, very many Per&s;ons of Quality, both of the Clergy and Laity, who had &s;uf|fer'd under the imputation of Puritani&s;m, and did very much di&s;like the proceedings of the Court, and oppo&s;ed them upon all occa&s;ions, were yet &s;o much &s;candalized at the very approaches to Rebellion, that they renounced all their old Friends, and applied them&s;elves with great Re|&s;olution, Courage, and Con&s;tancy to the King's Service, and continued in it to the end, with all the di&s;advantages it was liable to.</P>
<P>PRISONERS taken by the Enemy were, the Lord <HI>Willoughby,</HI> ha|&s;tily and piou&s;ly endeavouring the re&s;cue of his Father; S^r <HI>Thomas Luns|ford,</HI> and S^$ <HI>Edward Stradling,</HI> both Colonels; and S^r <HI>William Vava&s;our&punc;</HI> who commanded the King's Regiment of Guards under the Lord <HI>Wil|loughby;</HI> and &s;ome other inferior Commanders.

<P>$ WHEN the Armies had thus only look'd one upon another, the whole day, and it being di&s;cern'd that the Enemy had drawn off his Carriages, the King directed all his Army to retire into their old Quarters, pre|&s;uming (as it proved) that many of tho&s;e who were wanting would be found there. And &s;o him&s;elf with his two Sons went to <HI>Edgecot,</HI> where he lay the night before the Battle, re&s;olving to re&s;t the next day, both for the refre&s;hing his wearied, and even tired Men, and to be inform'd of the motion and condition of the Enemy, upon which &s;ome Troops of the King's Hor&s;e attended. The Earl of <HI>E&s;sex</HI> retired with his to <HI>Warwick</HI> Ca&s;tle, whither he had &s;ent all his Pri&s;oners; &s;o that, on the <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> morning, the King was inform'd, that the Enemy was gone, and that &s;ome of his Hor&s;e had attended the rear of the Enemy allmo&s;t to <HI>Warwick,</HI> and that they had left many of their Carriages, and very many of their wounded Soldiers at the Village next to the field; by which it appeared that their remove was in ha&s;t, and not without ap|prehen&s;ion.</P>
<P>AFTER the Hor&s;e had march'd allmo&s;t to <HI>Warwick,</HI> and found the Coa&s;t clear from the Enemy, they return'd to the field to view the dead Bodies, many going to enquire after their friends who were mi&s;&s;ing, where they found many not yet dead of their wounds, but lying &s;tripp'd among the dead; among whom, with others, young M^r <HI>Scroop</HI> brought off his Father, S^r <HI>Gervas Scroop;</HI> who, being an old Gentleman of great fortune in <HI>Lincoln-&s;hire,</HI> had rai&s;ed a Foot Company among his Tenants, and brought them in to the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey</HI>'s Regiment out of devotion and re&s;pect to his Lord&s;hip, as well as duty to the King; and had, about the time that the General was taken, faln with &s;ixteen wounds in his body and head; and had layen &s;tripp'd among the dead, from that time, which was about three in the afternoon on <HI>Sunday,</HI> all that cold night, all <HI>Munday,</HI> and <HI>Munday</HI> night, and till <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> evening, for it was &s;o late before his Son found him; whom with great piety he carried to a warm lodging, and afterwards to <HI>Oxford;</HI> where he wonderfully reco|ver'd. The next morning after, being <HI>Wedne&s;day,</HI> there was another Gentleman, one <HI>Bellingham,</HI> of an ancient extraction, and the only Son of his Father, found among the dead, and brought off by his Friends with twenty wounds; who, after ten days, died at <HI>Oxford,</HI> by the negli|gence of his Surgeons, who left a wound in his thigh, of it &s;elf not dan|gerous, undi&s;cern'd, and &s;o by fe&s;tering de&s;troyed a body very hopefully recover'd of tho&s;e which were only thought Mortal. The Surgeons were of opinion, that both the&s;e Gentlemen owed their lives to the inhuma|nity of tho&s;e who &s;tripp'd them, and to the coldne&s;s of the nights, which &s;topp'd their blood, better than all their skill and Medicaments could have done, and that if they had been brought off within any rea&s;on|able di&s;tance of time after their wounds, they had undoubtedly pe|$ri&s;hed.</P>
<P><PB N="44" REF="620">
ON <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> morning, the King drew his Army to a Rendezvous, where he found his Numbers greater than he expected; for, in the night after the Battle, very many of the Common Soldiers out of cold, and hunger, had found their old Quarters. So that it was really believ'd upon this view, when this little re&s;t had recover'd a &s;trange chearfulne&s;s into all Men, that there were not in that Battle lo&s;t above three hundred Men at mo&s;t. There the King declared General <HI>Ruthen</HI> General of his Army in the place of the Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey;</HI> and then march'd to <HI>Ayno,</HI> a little Village two miles di&s;tant from <HI>Banbury,</HI> of which his Maje&s;ty that day took a View, and meant to attempt it the next day following. <MILESTONE N="10"> There was at that time in <HI>Banbury</HI> Ca&s;tle a Regiment of eight hundred Foot, and a Troop of Hor&s;e, which, with Spirits proportionable, had been enough to have kept &s;o &s;trong a place from an Army better pre|pared to have a&s;&s;aulted it, than the Kings then was, and at a &s;ea&s;on of the year more commodious for a Seige. And therefore many were of opinion, that the King &s;hould have march'd by it, without taking notice of it, and that the engaging before it, might prove very prejudicial to him. That which prevailed with him to &s;tay there, be&s;ides the Courage of his Soldiers, who had again recover'd their appetite to Action, was that he could not well re&s;olve whither to go; for till he was inform'd <MILESTONE N="20"> what the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex</HI> did, he knew not how to direct his march; and if the Enemy advanced upon him, he could not fight in a place of more advantage. And therefore, having &s;ent a Trumpet to &s;ummon the Ca|&s;tle, and having fir&s;t taken the Lord <HI>Say</HI>'s Hou&s;e at <HI>Broughton,</HI> where there was &s;ome &s;hew of re&s;i&s;tance, and in it a Troop of Hor&s;e, and &s;ome good Armes, the Cannon were planted again&s;t the Ca&s;tle, and the Ar|my drawn out before it; but, upon the fir&s;t &s;hot made, the Ca&s;tle &s;ent to treat, and upon leave to go away without their Armes, they fairly and kindly deliver'd the place; and half the Common Soldiers at the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Banbury <HI>Ca|&s;tle &s;urrender|ed to the King.</HI></NOTE> lea&s;t readily took conditions, and put them&s;elves into the King's Army, <MILESTONE N="30"> the re&s;t of the Armes came very &s;ea&s;onably to &s;upply many Soldiers of every Regiment, who either never had any before, or had lo&s;t them at the Battle.</P>
<P>THIS la&s;t &s;ucce&s;s declared where the Victory was before at <HI>Edge-hill;</HI> for, though the routing of their Hor&s;e, the having kill'd more upon the place, and taken more Pri&s;oners, the number of the Colours wone from the Enemy (which were near forty in number) without the lo&s;s of above three or four, and la&s;tly the taking four pieces of their Cannon the next morning after the Battle, were &s;o many Arguments that the Victory inclined to the King: On the other &s;ide, the lo&s;s of the General him&s;elf, <MILESTONE N="40"> and &s;o many Men of Name either kill'd or taken Pri&s;oners, who were generally known over the Kingdom (whereas, be&s;ides the Lord <HI>Saint Johns,</HI> and Colonel <HI>E&s;sex,</HI> the names of the re&s;t of that Party were &s;o ob&s;cure, that neither the one &s;ide &s;eem'd to be gainers by having taken or kill'd them, nor the other &s;ide to be lo&s;ers by being without them) the having kept the field la&s;t, were &s;ufficient Te&s;timonies at the lea&s;t that they were not overcome. But now the taking of <HI>Banbury,</HI> which was the more &s;ignal, by the circum&s;tances of that part of the Armies being, before the Battle, de&s;ign'd for that &s;ervice, then recalled to the field, and after that field fought, and the Retreat of the Enemy, the Readvancing <MILESTONE N="50"> upon it, and taking it, was &s;o undeniable an Argument that the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex</HI> was more broken and &s;catter'd than at fir&s;t he appear'd to be, that the King's Army was look'd upon as Victorious. A Garri&s;on was
<PB N="45" REF="630">
put into <HI>Banbury,</HI> and the Command thereof committed to the Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> and then the King marched to his own Hou&s;e at <HI>Wood|&s;tock;</HI> and the next day with the whole Army to <HI>Oxford,</HI> which was the only City of <HI>England,</HI> that he could &s;ay was entirely at his devo|tion; where he was receiv'd by the Univer&s;ity, to whom the integri|ty and fidelity of that place is to be imputed, with all joy, and accla|mation.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> continued &s;till at <HI>Warwick,</HI> repairing his broken <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The condition of the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex<HI>'s Army after the fight.</HI></NOTE> Regiments and Troops, which every day le&s;&s;en'd and impaired; for the number of his &s;lain Men was greater than it was reported to be, there <MILESTONE N="10"> being very many kill'd in the cha&s;e, and many who died of their wounds after they were carried off, and, of tho&s;e, who run away in the begin|ning, more &s;tayed away than return'd; and which was more, they who run farthe&s;t and fa&s;te&s;t told &s;uch lamentable Stories of the defeat, and many of them &s;hew'd &s;uch hurts, that the terror thereof was even ready to make the People revolt to their Allegiance in all places. Many of tho&s;e who had &s;tood their ground, and behaved them&s;elves well in the Battle, either with remor&s;e of Con&s;cience, horror of what they had done, and &s;een, or wearine&s;s of the duty and danger, withdre$ them&s;elves from their Colours, and &s;ome from their Commands. And it is certain <MILESTONE N="20"> many engaged them&s;elves fir&s;t in that &s;ervice, out of an opinion, that an Army would procure a Peace without fighting; others out of a de|&s;ire to &s;erve the King, and re&s;olving to go away them&s;elves, and to carry others with them, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould find them&s;elves within a &s;ecure di&s;tance to do it; both the&s;e being, contrary to their expecta|tion, brought to fight, the latter, not knowing how to get to the King's Army in the Battle, di&s;charged them&s;elves of the Service a&s;&s;oon as they came to <HI>Warwick;</HI> &s;ome with leave, and &s;ome without. But that which no doubt mo&s;t troubled his Excellency was the temper, and con&s;titu|tions of his new Ma&s;ters; who, he knew, expected no le&s;s from him than <MILESTONE N="30"> a Victory compleat, by his bringing the Per&s;on of the King alive or dead to them; and would con&s;ider what was now fallen out, as it was &s;o much le&s;s than they look'd for, not as it was more than any body el&s;e could have done for them. However, he gave them a glorious account of what had pa&s;&s;ed, and made as if his &s;tay at <HI>Warwick</HI> were rather to re|ceive new Orders and Commands from them, than out of any weakne&s;s or inability to pur&s;ue the old, and that he attended the King's motion as well as if he had been within &s;even miles of him.</P>
<P>IT is certain the con&s;ternation was very great at <HI>London,</HI> and in the two Hou&s;es, from the time that they heard, that the King march'd from <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> with a formed Army, and that he was re&s;olv'd to fight, a&s;&s;oon as he could meet with theirs. However they endeavour'd to keep up confidently the ridiculous opinion among the Common People, that the King did not Command, but was carried about in that Army of the Cavaliers, and was de&s;irous to e&s;cape from them; which they hoped the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex</HI> would give him opportunity to do. The fir&s;t news they heard of the Armies being engaged, was by tho&s;e who fled upon the fir&s;t charge; who made marvellous ha&s;t from the place of danger, and thought not them&s;elves &s;afe, till they were gotten out of any po&s;&s;ible di&s;tance of being pur&s;ued. It is certain, though it was pa&s;t two of the clock before <MILESTONE N="50"> the Battle begun, many of the Soldiers, and &s;ome Commanders of no mean Name, were at S^t <HI>Albans,</HI> which was near thirty miles from the field, before it was dark. The&s;e Men, as all Runaways do for their own
<PB N="46" REF="640">
excu&s;e, reported all for lo&s;t, and the King's Army to be &s;o terrible, that it could not be encounter'd. Some of them, that they might not be thought to come away before there was cau&s;e, or whil&s;t there was any hope, reported the progre&s;s of the Battle, and pre&s;ented all tho&s;e lamen|table things, and the circum&s;tances by which every part of the Army was defeated, which their terrified fancies had &s;ugge&s;ted to them whil&s;t they run away; &s;ome had &s;een the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;lain, and heard his dying words; <Q>&startq;That every one &s;hould &s;hift for him&s;elf, for all re&s;i&s;tance&endq; was to no purpo&s;e:</Q> So that the whole City was, the <HI>Munday,</HI> full of the defeat; and though there was an expre&s;s, from the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> him|&s;elf, <MILESTONE N="10"> of the contrary, there was not Courage enough left to believe it, and every hour produced &s;omewhat to contradict the reports of the la&s;t. <HI>Munday</HI> in the afternoon, the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> produced a Letter in the Hou&s;e of Peers, which was written the night before by the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> in which all particulars of the day were &s;et down, <Q>and &startq;the im|pre&s;&s;ion which had in the beginning been made upon his Hor&s;e, but&endq; that the conclu&s;ion was pro&s;perous.</Q> Whil&s;t this was reading, and eve|ry Man greedily dige&s;ting the good news, the Lord <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> who had a Command of Hor&s;e in the &s;ervice, enter'd the Hou&s;e with frighted and gha&s;tly looks, <Q>and po&s;itively declared &startq;all to be lo&s;t, again&s;t what&s;oever&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> they believ'd or flater'd them&s;elves with.</Q> And though it was evident enough that he had run away from the beginning, and only lo&s;t his way thither, mo&s;t Men look'd upon him as the la&s;t Me&s;&s;enger, and even &s;hut their ears again&s;t any po&s;&s;ible comfort; &s;o that without doubt very many, in the horror and con&s;ternation of eight and forty hours, paid and underwent a full penance and mortification for the hopes, and in|&s;olence of three months before. At the la&s;t, on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> morning, the Lord <HI>Wharton,</HI> and M^r <HI>William Strode,</HI> the one a Member of the Hou&s;e of Lords, the other of the Commons, arrived from the Army, and made &s;o full a relation of the Battle, <Q>&startq;of the great Numbers &s;lain <MILESTONE N="30"> on the King's part, without any con&s;iderable lo&s;s on Their &s;ide, of the mi&s;erable and weak condition the King's Army was in, and of the Earl&endq; of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s re&s;olution to pur&s;ue him,</Q> <Q>That they were not now content to be &s;avers, but Voted &startq;&endq;that their Army had the Victory;</Q> and ap|pointed a day for a &s;olemn thank&s;giving to God for the &s;ame; and that &s;o great a joy might not be enjoyed only within tho&s;e Walls, they ap|pointed tho&s;e two tru&s;ty Me&s;&s;engers to communicate the whole relation with all circum&s;tances to the City; which was convened together at the <HI>Guild-Hall</HI> to receive the &s;ame. But by this time, &s;o many Per&s;ons, who were pre&s;ent at the Action, came to the Town of both &s;ides (for <MILESTONE N="40"> there was yet a free intercour&s;e with all Quarters) and &s;ome di&s;cour&s;es were publi&s;hed, how little either of the&s;e two Me&s;&s;engers had &s;een them|&s;elves of that days bu&s;ine&s;s, that the City &s;eem'd not &s;o much exalted at their Relations, as the Hou&s;es had been; the King's taking <HI>Banbury,</HI> and marching afterwards to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and the reports from tho&s;e parts of his power, with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s lying &s;till at <HI>Warwick,</HI> gave great Argument of di&s;cour&s;e; <Q>which grew the greater by the commitment of &s;everal Per&s;ons, for reporting &startq;&endq;that the King had the better of the field;</Q> which Men thought would not have been, if the &s;ucce&s;s had been con|trary; and therefore there was nothing &s;o generally &s;poken of, or wi&s;h'd <MILESTONE N="50"> for, as Peace.</P>
<P>THEY who were really well affected to the King, and from the be|ginning oppo&s;ed all the extravagances, for of &s;uch there were many in
<PB N="47" REF="650">
both Hou&s;es, who could not yet find in their hearts to leave the com|pany, <Q>&s;pake now aloud, &startq;that an humble Addre&s;s to the King for the removal of all mi&s;under&s;tandings, was both in Duty nece&s;&s;ary, and in&endq; Policy convenient.</Q> The half hearted, and half witted People, which made much the Major part of both Hou&s;es, plainly di&s;cern'd there mu&s;t be a War, and that the King at lea&s;t would be able to make re&s;i&s;tance, which they had been promi&s;ed he could not do, and &s;o were equally pa&s;&s;ionate to make any overtures for accommodation. They only who had contrived the mi&s;chief, and already had dige&s;ted a full change and alteration of Government, and knew well, that all their Arts would be di&s;cover'd, <MILESTONE N="10"> and their Per&s;ons odious, though they might be &s;ecured, vio|lently oppo&s;ed all motions of this kind. <Q>The&s;e Men pre&s;s'd earne&s;tly &startq;to &s;end an expre&s;s to their Brethren of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to invite, and con|jure them to come to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to leave no way unthought of, for &s;uppre&s;&s;ing, and totally de&s;troying all tho&s;e who had pre&s;um'd&endq; to &s;ide with the King.</Q> This overture of calling the <HI>Scots</HI> in again was as Unpopular a thing, as could be mention'd; be&s;ides that it implied a great, and ab&s;olute diffidence in their own &s;trength, an$ an acknow|ledgement that the People of <HI>England</HI> &s;tood not &s;o generally affected to their de&s;ires, which they had hitherto publi&s;hed, and urged, as the be&s;t <MILESTONE N="20"> Argument to ju&s;tify tho&s;e de&s;ires. <Q>Therefore the wi&s;e Managers of that Party, by who&s;e conduct they had been principally govern'd, &s;eem'd fully to concur with tho&s;e who de&s;ired Peace, &startq;and to &s;end an humble Addre&s;s to the King, which they confe&s;s'd to be due from them as&endq; Subjects, and the only way to procure happine&s;s for the Kingdom.</Q> <Q>And having hereby render'd them&s;elves gracious, and gained credit, they advi&s;ed them &startq;&s;o to endeavour Peace, that they might not be di&s;ap|pointed&endq; of it,</Q> <Q>and wi&s;h'd them &startq;to con&s;ider that the King's Party were high upon the &s;ucce&s;s of having an Army (of which they had rea&s;on|ably before de&s;paired) though not upon any thing that Army had yet <MILESTONE N="30"> done. That it was apparent, the King had Mini&s;ters &s;tirring for him in the North, and in the We&s;t, though hitherto with little effect; and therefore if they &s;hould make &s;uch an application for Peace, as might imply the giving over the thoughts of War, they mu&s;t expect &s;uch a Peace, as the mercy of tho&s;e whom they had provoked would con&s;ent to. But if they would &s;teddily pur&s;ue tho&s;e Coun&s;els as would make their &s;trength formidable, they might then expect &s;uch moderate con|ditions, as they might, with their own, and the Kingdom's &s;afety, &s;e|curely &s;ubmit to. That therefore the propo&s;ition of &s;ending into <HI>Scot|land</HI> was very &s;ea&s;onable; not that it could be hoped, or was de&s;ired, <MILESTONE N="40"> that they &s;hould bring an Army into <HI>England,</HI> of which there was not like to be any need; but that that Kingdom might make &s;uch a De|claration of their Affections, and readine&s;s to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Parliament, that the King might look upon them with the more con&s;ideration, as a Body not ea&s;ily to be oppre&s;s'd, if he &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon too high con|ditions.&endq;</Q></P>
<P>BY this Artifice, whil&s;t they who pre&s;&s;ed a Treaty thought, that that being once con&s;ented to, a Peace would inevitably be concluded, <Q>the &s;ame day that a Committee was appointed &startq;to prepare heads of an hum|ble Addre&s;s unto his Maje&s;ty, for compo&s;ing the pre&s;ent differences, and&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> di&s;tractions,</Q> and &s;ettling the Peace of the Kingdom (which was a great conde&s;cention) they made no &s;cruple to declare, <Q>&startq;that the preparations of Forces, and all other nece&s;&s;ary means for defence, &s;hould be pro&s;e|cuted&endq;

And the King him&s;elf was &s;o confident that the Affections of that People could not be &s;o corrupted towards him, as to make a farther attempt upon him, that he believ'd them, to a de|gree, &s;en&s;ible of their former breach of duty, and willing to repair it by any &s;ervice. <Q><HI>Le&s;lie</HI> him&s;elf had made great acknowledgments, and great profe&s;&s;ions to him, and had told him, &startq;that it was nothing to promi&s;e him, that he would never more bear Armes again&s;t him, but he pro|mi&s;ed he would &s;erve his Maje&s;ty upon any &s;ummons without asking&endq; the cau&s;e.</Q> The Earl of <HI>Lowden,</HI> and all the re&s;t, who had mi&s;led the People, were po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of what&s;oever they could de&s;ire, and the future fortune of That Nation &s;eem'd to depend wholely upon the keeping up the King's full power in This.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty had, from time to time, given his Council of that King|dom full relations of all his differences with his Parliament, and had carefully &s;ent them the Declarations, and publick Pa&s;&s;ages of both &s;ides, and they had allways return'd very ample expre&s;&s;ions of their Affections and Duty, and expre&s;s'd a great &s;en&s;e of the Parliaments proceedings towards him. And &s;ince the time of his being at <HI>York,</HI> the Lord Chan|cellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in who&s;e Integrity and Loyalty he was lea&s;t &s;ecure, had been with him; and &s;eem'd &s;o well &s;atisfied with the Ju&s;tice and Honour of his Maje&s;ties carriage towards the Parliament, that he writ to the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners at <HI>London,</HI> in the Name, and as by the di|rection of the Lords of the &s;ecret Council of that Kingdom, <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould pre&s;ent to the two Hou&s;es the deep &s;en&s;e they had of the Inju|ries and Indignities, which were offer'd to the King, who&s;e ju&s;t Rights they were bound to defend; and that they &s;hould conjure them, to bind up tho&s;e wounds which were made, and not to widen them by &s;harpne&s;s of Language; and to give his Maje&s;ty &s;uch real &s;ecurity for his &s;afety among them, by an effectual declaring again&s;t Tumults, and &s;uch other Actions as were ju&s;tly offen&s;ive to his Maje&s;ty, that he might be induced to re&s;ide nearer to them, and comply with them in&endq; &s;uch propo&s;itions as &s;hould be rea&s;onably made;</Q> with many &s;uch ex|pre&s;&s;ions, as together with his return into <HI>Scotland</HI> without coming to <HI>London,</HI> where he was expected, gave them &s;o much offence and jea|lou&s;y, that they never communicated that Letter to the Hou&s;es, and took all po&s;&s;ible care to conceal it from the People.</P>
<P>THE Marquis <HI>Hamilton</HI> had been likewi&s;e with his Maje&s;ty at <HI>York,</HI> and, finding the Eyes of all Men directed towards him with more than ordinary jealou&s;y, he offer'd the King to go into <HI>Scotland,</HI> with many A&s;&s;urances and undertakings, <Q>confident &startq;that he would at lea&s;t keep that People from doing any thing, that might &s;eem to countenance&endq; the carriage of the Parliament.</Q> Upon which promi&s;es, and to be rid of him at <HI>York,</HI> where he was by all Men look'd upon with marvelous prejudice, the King &s;uffer'd him to go, with full A&s;&s;urance that he would, and he was &s;ure he could, do him very good &s;ervice there: as, on the other &s;ide, in his own Court he was &s;o great an offence, that the whole Gentry of <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> who no doubt had infu&s;ions to that purpo&s;e from others, had a de&s;ign to have petition'd the King, that the Marquis might
<PB N="51" REF="690">
be &s;eque&s;ter'd from all Councils, and pre&s;ence at Court, as a Man too much tru&s;ted by them who would not tru&s;t his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>LASTLY, the King had many of the Nobility of <HI>Scotland</HI> then at|tending, and among tho&s;e the Earl of <HI>Calander,</HI> who had been Lieute|nant General of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Army, when it invaded <HI>England,</HI> and had freely confe&s;s'd to his Maje&s;ty, upon what errors and mi&s;takes he had been corrupted, and by whom, and pretended &s;o deep a &s;en&s;e of what he had done ami&s;s, that it was believ'd, he would have taken Command in the King's Army; which he declined, as if it might have been penal to him in <HI>Scotland</HI> by &s;ome clau&s;e in the Act of the Pacification, but <MILESTONE N="10"> e&s;pecially upon pretence it would di&s;able him from doing him greater &s;ervice in that Kingdom: whither, &s;hortly after the Standard was &s;et up, he repaired, with all &s;olemn Vows of a&s;&s;erting, and improving his Maje&s;ties Intere&s;t in tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>THE Parliament on the other hand a&s;&s;ured them&s;elves, that that Nation was entirely Theirs, having their Commi&s;&s;ioners re&s;iding with them at <HI>London;</HI> and the chief Managers and Governours in the fir&s;t War, by their late intercour&s;e, and communication of G$ilt, having a firm corre&s;pondence with the Marquis of <HI>Argile,</HI> the Ea$l of <HI>Lowden,</HI> and that Party, who being not able to excu&s;e them&s;elves, thought the <MILESTONE N="20"> King could never in his heart forgive them, when it &s;hould be in his power to bring them to ju&s;tice. And they undertook that when there &s;hould be need of that Nation (which the other thought there would never be) they &s;hould be as forward to &s;econd them as They had been; in the mean time return'd as fair, and re&s;pective An&s;wers to all their Me&s;&s;ages, and upon their Declarations, which were con&s;tantly &s;ent to them, as they did to the King; <Q>a&s;&s;i&s;ting them in their de&s;ign again&s;t the Church, which was not yet grown Popular even in the two Hou&s;es, by declaring &startq;that the People of that Nation could never be engaged&endq; on any other ground, than the Reformation of Religion.</Q> And there|fore, <MILESTONE N="30"> about the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the A&s;&s;embly of the Kirk of <HI>Scot|land</HI> publi&s;h'd a Declaration; <Q>&startq;how exceedingly griev'd they were, and made heavy, that in &s;o long a time, again&s;t the profe&s;&s;ions both of King and Parliament, and contrary to the joynt de&s;ires and prayers of the Godly in both Kingdoms, to whom it was more dear and precious, than what was deare&s;t to them in the world, the Reformation of Re|ligion&endq; had moved &s;o &s;lowly, and &s;uffer'd &s;o great interruption.</Q></P>
<P>THE ground of which reproach was this; in the late Treaty of Peace, the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Scotland</HI> had expre&s;s'd a de&s;ire or wi&s;h warily couched in words, rather than a Propo&s;ition, <Q>&startq;that there were &s;uch an unity <MILESTONE N="40"> of Religion, and Uniformity of Church Government agreed on, as might be a &s;pecial means for con&s;erving of Peace betwixt the two&endq; Kingdoms:</Q> To which there had been a general inclination to return a rough An&s;wer, and reproof for their intermedling in any thing that related to the Laws of <HI>England.</HI> But, by the extraordinary indu&s;try, and &s;ubtlety of tho&s;e, who &s;aw that bu&s;ine&s;s was not yet ripe, and who alledged, that it was only wi&s;h'd, not propo&s;ed, and therefore that a &s;harp reply was not merited, this gentle An&s;wer, again&s;t the minds of very many, was return'd,</P>
<P><Q>&startq;THAT his Maje&s;ty, with the advice of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, did <MILESTONE N="$0"> approve of the Affection of his Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in their de&s;ire of having conformity of Church Government between the two Nations; and as the Parliament had already taken into con&s;ideration the Refor|mation
<PB N="52" REF="700">
of Church Government, &s;o they would proceed therein in due time, as &s;hould be&s;t conduce to the glory of God, the Peace of the&endq; Church, and of both Kingdoms.</Q></P>
<P>WHICH was con&s;ented to by mo&s;t, as a civil An&s;wer, &s;ignifying, or concluding nothing; by others, becau&s;e it admitted an interpretation of reducing the Government of the Church in <HI>Scotland</HI> to this of <HI>England,</HI> as much as the contrary. But it might have been well di&s;cern'd, that tho&s;e Men asked nothing without a farther de&s;ign than the words na|turally imported, nor ever re&s;ted &s;atisfied with a general formal An&s;wer, except they found, that they &s;hould hereafter make u&s;e, and receive benefit by &s;uch An&s;wer. So they now urged the matter of this An&s;wer, as a &s;ufficient Title to demand the extirpation of Prelacy in <HI>England,</HI> and demoli&s;hing the whole Fabrick of that glorious Church; urging his Maje&s;ties late practice, while he was in Per&s;on in <HI>Scotland,</HI> in re&s;orting frequently to their exerci&s;es of publick Wor&s;hip; and his Royal Actions, in e&s;tabli&s;hing the Wor&s;hip and Government of that Kirk in Parliament.
<Q>And therefore they de&s;ired the Parliament &startq;to begin their work of Re|formation at the Uniformity of Kirk Government; for that there could be no hope of unity in Religion, of one confe&s;&s;ion of Faith, one form of Wor&s;hip, and one Catechi&s;m, till there were fir&s;t one form of Church Government; and that the Kingdom, and Kirk of <HI>Scotland,</HI> could have no hope of a firm and durable Peace, till Prelacy, which had been the main cau&s;e of their mi&s;eries and troubles, fir&s;t and la&s;t, were pluck'd up root and branch, as a plant which God had not planted, and from which no better fruits could be expected, than &s;uch &s;owr&endq; Grapes, as at that day &s;et on edge the Kingdom of <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P><Q>WHICH Declaration the Lords of the &s;ecret Council, finding, as they &s;aid, &startq;the rea&s;ons therein expre&s;s'd to be very pregnant, and the par|ticulars de&s;ired, much to conduce to the glory of God, the advance|ment of the true Chri&s;tian Faith, his Maje&s;ties Honour, and the Peace,&endq; and union of his Dominions, well approv'd of;</Q> and concurred in their earne&s;t de&s;ires to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, <Q>&startq;to take to their &s;e|rious con&s;iderations tho&s;e particulars, and to give favourable hearing to &s;uch de&s;ires and overtures, as &s;hould be found mo&s;t conducible to&endq; the promoting &s;o great, and &s;o good a work.</Q></P>
<P>THIS being &s;ent to the Parliament at the time they were forming their Army, and when the King was preparing for his defence, they who, from the beginning, had principally intended this confu&s;ion of the Church, <Q>in&s;inuated &startq;how nece&s;&s;ary it was, &s;peedily to return a very affectionate, and &s;atisfactory reply to the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland;</HI> not only to pre&s;erve the reputation of unity, and con&s;ent between them, which, at that time, was very u&s;eful to them, but to hinder the ope|rations of the di&s;affected in that Kingdom; who, upon infu&s;ions that the Parliament only aim'd at taking his Maje&s;ties Regal rights from him, to the prejudice of Monarchique Government, without any thought of reforming Religion, endeavour'd to pervert the Affections of that People towards the Parliament. Whereas if they were once a&s;&s;ured there was a purpo&s;e to reform Religion, they &s;hould be &s;ure to have their Hearts; and, if occa&s;ion required, their Hands too; which po&s;&s;ibly might be &s;educed for the King, if that purpo&s;e were not ma|nife&s;ted. Therefore, for the pre&s;ent, they &s;hould do well to return their hearty thanks for, and their Brotherly acceptance and approba|tion of the de&s;ires, and advice of that Chri&s;tian A&s;&s;embly, and of the
<PB N="53" REF="710">
Lords of the Council; and that though, for the pre&s;ent, by rea&s;on of the King's di&s;tance from the Parliament, they could not &s;ettle any conclu&s;ion in that matter, yet for Their parts they were re&s;olv'd to en|deavour&endq; it.</Q></P>
<P>BY this Artifice and Invention, they procured a Declaration from the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, of wonderful kindne&s;s, and confe&s;&s;ion of many inconveniencies, and mi&s;chiefs the Kingdom had &s;u&s;tain'd by Bi|&s;hops; <Q>and therefore they declared, &startq;that that Hierarchical Govern|ment was evil, and ju&s;tly offen&s;ive, and burthen&s;ome to the Kingdom; a great impediment to Reformation, and growth of Religion; very pre|judicial <MILESTONE N="10"> to the State and Government of the Kingdom; and that they were re&s;olv'd, that the &s;ame &s;hould be taken away; and that their pur|po&s;e was to con&s;ult with Godly, and Learned Divines, that they might not only remove That, but &s;ettle &s;uch a Government, as might be mo&s;t agreeable to Gods holy word; mo&s;t apt to procure, and con&s;erve the Peace of the Church at home, and happy union with the Church of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and other Reform'd Churches abroad; and to e&s;tabli&s;h the &s;ame by a Law, which they intended to frame for that purpo&s;e, to be pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty for his Royal A&s;&s;ent; and in the mean time to be&s;eech him, that a Bill for the A&s;&s;embly might be pa&s;&s;ed in&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> time convenient for their meeting;</Q> the two Hou&s;es having extrajudi|cially and extravagantly nominated their own Divines to that purpo&s;e, as is before remember'd.</P>
<P>IT was then believ'd by many, and the King was per&s;waded to believe the &s;ame, that all tho&s;e importunities from <HI>Scotland</HI> concerning the Go|vernment of the Church, were u&s;ed only to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from being pre&s;s'd by the Parliament, to joyn with them again&s;t the King; imagining that this Kingdom would never have con&s;ented to &s;uch an al|teration; and they again pretending, that no other obligation could unite that People in their &s;ervice. <Q>But it is mo&s;t certain, this la&s;t De|claration <MILESTONE N="30"> was procured by per&s;wading Men, &startq;that it was for the pre&s;ent nece&s;&s;ary, and that it was only an Engagement to do their be&s;t to per|&s;wade his Maje&s;ty, who they concluded would be inexorable in the&endq; point (which they &s;eem'd not to be &s;orry for)</Q> <Q>&startq;and that a receding from&endq; &s;uch a conclu&s;ion would be a means to gratify his Maje&s;ty in a Treaty.</Q> At wor&s;t, they all knew, that there would be room enough, when any Bill &s;hould be brought in, to oppo&s;e what they had, for this rea&s;on of State, &s;eem'd generally to con&s;ent to. And &s;o by the&s;e Stratagems, thinking to be too hard for each other, they grew all &s;o entangled, that they &s;till wound them&s;elves deeper into tho&s;e Labyrinths, in which the <MILESTONE N="40"> Major part meant not to be involv'd. And what effect that Declaration of the two Hou&s;es, after the Battle of <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> which is mention'd be|fore, wrought, will very &s;hortly appear.</P>
<P>THE King found him&s;elf in good ea&s;e at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where care was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King at</HI> Oxford <HI>re|cruits his Ar|my.</HI></NOTE> taken for providing for the &s;ick, and wounded Soldiers, and for the ac|commodation of the Army, which was, in a &s;hort time, recruited there in a good mea&s;ure; and the &s;everal Colleges pre&s;ented his Maje&s;ty with all the Money they had in their Trea&s;uries, which amounted to a good Sum, and was a very &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply, as they had formerly &s;ent him all their Plate. It had been very happy, if the King had continued his <MILESTONE N="50"> re&s;olution of &s;itting &s;till during the Winter, without making farther at|tempts; for his reputation was now great, and his Army believ'd to be much greater than it was, by the Victory they had obtain'd, and the
<PB N="54" REF="720">
Parliament grew more divided into factions, and di&s;like of what they had done, and the City appear'd fuller of di&s;content, and le&s;s inclined to be impo&s;ed upon than they had been: &s;o that on all hands nothing was pre&s;s'd, but that &s;ome addre&s;s might be made to the King for an ac|commodation; which temper and di&s;po&s;ition might have been culti|vated, as many Men thought, to great effects, if no farther approaches had been made to <HI>London,</HI> to &s;hew them how little cau&s;e they had for their great fear. But the Weather growing fair again, as it often is about <HI>Allhollantide,</HI> and a good party of Hor&s;e having been &s;ent out from <HI>Abingdon,</HI> where the head Quarter of the Hor&s;e was, they ad|vanced <MILESTONE N="10"> farther than they had order to do, and upon their approach to <HI>Reading,</HI> where <HI>Harry Martin</HI> was Governour for the Parliament, there <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Garri&s;on of the Parlia|ment at</HI> Read|ing <HI>quitting it, the King marches thi|ther.</HI></NOTE> was a great terror &s;ei&s;ed upon them, in&s;omuch as Governour and Gar|ri&s;on fled to <HI>London,</HI> and left the place to the party of Hor&s;e; <Q>which gave adverti&s;ement to the King, &startq;that all fled before them; that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> remain'd &s;till at <HI>Warwick,</HI> having no Army to March; and that there was &s;o great divi&s;ions in the Parliament, that, upon his Maje&s;ties approach, they would all fly; and that nothing could inter|rupt him from going to <HI>White-Hall.</HI> However, <HI>Reading</HI> it &s;elf was &s;o good a Po&s;t, that if the King &s;hould find it nece&s;&s;ary to make his own <MILESTONE N="20"> Re&s;idence in <HI>Oxford,</HI> it would be much the better by having a Garri|&s;on&endq; at <HI>Reading.</HI></Q></P>
<P>UPON the&s;e and other motives, be&s;ides the natural credulity in Men, in believing all they wi&s;h to be true, the King was prevailed with to march with his Army to <HI>Reading.</HI> This Alarm quickly came to <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and was receiv'd with the deepe&s;t horror: they now unbeliev'd all which had been told them from their own Army; that Army which, they were told, was well beaten, and &s;catter'd, was now advanced within thirty Miles of <HI>London;</HI> and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who pretended to the Victory, and who they &s;uppo&s;ed was watching the King, that he might <MILESTONE N="30"> not e&s;cape from him, could not be heard of, and continued &s;till at <HI>War|wick.</HI> Whil&s;t the King was at <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> they gave orders Magi&s;terially for the War, but now it was come to their own doors, they took not that delight in it.</P>
<P><Q>BEFORE they were re&s;olv'd what to &s;ay, they di&s;patch'd a Me&s;&s;en|ger, who found the King at <HI>Reading,</HI> only to de&s;ire &startq;a &s;afe conduct from his Maje&s;ty for a Committee of Lords and Commons, to attend his Maje&s;ty with an humble Petition from his Parliament. The King pre|&s;ently&endq; return'd his An&s;wer,</Q> <Q>&startq;that he had allways been, and was &s;till ready to receive any Petition from them; that their Committee &s;hould <MILESTONE N="40"> be Welcome, provided it con&s;i&s;ted of Per&s;ons, who had not been by name declared Traytors by his Maje&s;ty, and excepted as &s;uch in his&endq; Declarations, or Proclamations.</Q> The cau&s;e of this limitation was as well the former Rule his Maje&s;ty had &s;et down at <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> (from whence he thought not fit now to recede, after a Battle) as that he might prevent the Lord <HI>Say</HI>'s being &s;ent to him, from whom he could expect no entire, and upright dealing.</P>
<P><Q>THE next day another Letter came from the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Peers to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> one of his Maje&s;ties principal Secretaries, to de&s;ire &startq;a &s;afe conduct for the Earls of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and <HI>Pem|broke,</HI> and four Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, to attend his Ma|je&s;ty&endq; with their Petition;</Q> which &s;afe conduct was immediately &s;ign'd by his Maje&s;ty, excepting only for S^r <HI>John Evelyn,</HI> who was by name
<PB N="55" REF="730">
excepted in his Maje&s;ties Proclamation of Pardon to the County of <HI>Wilts;</HI> <Q>which Proclamation was then &s;ent to them with a &s;ignification, &startq;that if they would &s;end any other Per&s;on in his place, not &s;ubject to the &s;ame exception, he &s;hould be receiv'd as if his name were in the&endq; &s;afe conduct.</Q> Though this was no more than they had cau&s;e to look for, yet it gave them opportunity for a time to lay a &s;ide the thought of Petitioning, as if his Maje&s;ty had rejected all overtures of Peace: <Q>&startq;For he might every day proclaim as many of their Members Traytors, and except them from Pardon, as he plea&s;ed, and therefore it was to no purpo&s;e to prepare Petitions, and appoint Me&s;&s;engers to pre&s;ent <MILESTONE N="10"> them, when it was po&s;&s;ible tho&s;e Me&s;&s;engers might, the hour before, be proclaim'd Traytors: that to &s;ubmit to &s;uch a limitation of the King's was, upon the matter, to con&s;ent to, and approve the highe&s;t&endq; breach of Priviledge, that had been yet offer'd to them.</Q></P>
<P>SO that, for &s;ome days, all di&s;cour&s;e of Peace was waved, and all po&s;&s;ible preparations for defence and re&s;i&s;tance made; for which they had a &s;tronger Argument than either of the other, the advancing of their General, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who was now on his march towards <HI>Lon|don;</HI> and a great fame came before him of the &s;trength and Courage of his Army; though in truth it was not an&s;werable to the report: How|ever, <MILESTONE N="20"> it &s;erv'd to encourage, and inflame tho&s;e who&s;e fear only inclined them to Peace, and to awe the re&s;t. The King, who had every night an account of what was tran&s;acted in the Hou&s;es all day (what the clo&s;e Committee did, who guided all private de&s;igns, was not &s;o &s;oon known) re&s;olv'd to quicken them; and advanced with his whole Army to <HI>Cole|brook.</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King ad|vances to</HI> Colebrook.</NOTE> This indeed exalted their appetite to Peace; for the clamour of the People was importunate, and &s;omewhat humbled their Style; for at <HI>Colebrook,</HI> the 11^t^h of <HI>November,</HI> his Maje&s;ty was met by the two Earls of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and <HI>Pembroke,</HI> with tho&s;e three of the Hou&s;e of Commons who&s;e Names were in the &s;afe conduct; they &s;atisfying <MILESTONE N="30"> them&s;elves, that the leaving S^r <HI>John Evelyn</HI> behind them, without bring|ing another in his room, was no Submi&s;&s;ion to the King's exception: and this Petition was by them pre&s;ented to him.</P>

<P>THE King, within two or three hours after the receipt of this Peti|tion, deliver'd to the &s;ame Me&s;&s;engers, this en&s;uing An&s;wer, with which they return'd the &s;ame Night to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P><Q>&startq;WE take God to Witne&s;s, how deeply We are affected with the mi|&s;eries <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's An&s;wer.</NOTE> of this Kingdom, which heretofore We have &s;troven, as much as in Us lay to prevent; it being &s;ufficiently known to all the world that, as We were not the fir&s;t that took up Armes, &s;o, We have &s;hew'd Our readine&s;s of compo&s;ing all things in a fair way, by our &s;everal of|fers <MILESTONE N="20"> of Treaty, and &s;hall be glad now at length to find any &s;uch incli|nations in others. The &s;ame tenderne&s;s to avoid the de&s;truction of our Subjects (whom We know to be our greate&s;t &s;trength) which would allways make our greate&s;t Victories bitter to us, &s;hall make us willing|ly hearken to &s;uch Propo&s;itions, whereby the&s;e bloody di&s;tempers may be &s;topp'd, and the great di&s;tractions of this Kingdom &s;ettled to Gods glory, Our Honour, and the Welfare, and Flouri&s;hing of Our People: And to that end &s;hall re&s;ide at our own Ca&s;tle at <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> (if the Forces there &s;hall be removed) till Committees may have time to attend us with the &s;ame (which, to prevent the Inconveniencies that will inter|vene, <MILESTONE N="30"> We wi&s;h be ha&s;tned) and &s;hall be ready there, or, if that be re|fu&s;ed us, at any place where We &s;hall be, to receive &s;uch Propo&s;itions as afore&s;aid, from both our Hou&s;es of Parliament.

<P>IT was then believ'd by many, that if the King had, a&s;&s;oon as the Me&s;&s;engers return'd to <HI>London,</HI> retired with his Army to <HI>Reading,</HI> and there expected the Parliaments An&s;wer, they would immediately have withdrawn their Garri&s;on from <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and deliver'd that Ca&s;tle to his Maje&s;ty for his accommodation to have treated in: And without doubt <MILESTONE N="40"> tho&s;e Lords who had been with the Petition, and &s;ome others who thought them&s;elves as much over-&s;haddow'd by the greatne&s;s of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and the Chief Officers of the Army, as they could be by the glory of any Favourite, or power of any Coun&s;ellors, were re&s;olv'd to merit as much as they could of the King, by advancing an honourable Peace; and had it in their purpo&s;e to endeavour the giving up of <HI>Wind|&s;or</HI> to the King; but whether they would have been able to have pre|vailed that &s;o con&s;iderable a &s;trength, in &s;o con&s;iderable a place, &s;hould have been quitted, whil&s;t there was only hope of a Peace, I much doubt. But certainly the King's Army carried great terror with it; and all tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="50"> reports, which publi&s;h'd the weakne&s;s of it, grew to be peremptorily disbeliev'd. For, be&s;ides that every days experience di&s;prov'd &s;omewhat which was &s;o confidently reported, and it was evident great indu&s;try was
<PB N="57" REF="750">
u&s;ed to apply &s;uch Intelligence to the People as was mo&s;t like to make impre&s;&s;ion upon the pa&s;&s;ions, and affections of the Vulgar-&s;pirited, it could not be believ'd that a handful of Men could have given Battle to their formidable Army, and, after taking two or three of their Garri|&s;ons, pre&s;ume to march within fifteen Miles of <HI>London:</HI> &s;o that, if from thence the King had drawn back again to <HI>Reading,</HI> relying upon a Treaty for the re&s;t, it is probable his power would have been more valued, and con&s;equently his grace the more magnified. And &s;ure the King re&s;olv'd to have done &s;o, or at lea&s;t to have &s;tayed at <HI>Colebrook</HI> till he heard again from the Parliament. But Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> exalted with the ter|ror <MILESTONE N="10"> he heard his Name gave to the Enemy, tru&s;ting too much to the Vulgar Intelligence every Man receiv'd from his Friends at <HI>London,</HI> who according to their own pa&s;&s;ions and the Affections of tho&s;e with whom they corre&s;ponded, concluded that the King had &s;o great a Party in <HI>London,</HI> that, if his Army drew near, no re&s;i&s;tance would be made, without any direction from the King, the very next morning after the Committee return'd to <HI>London,</HI> advanced with the Hor&s;e and Dragoons to <HI>Hown&s;low,</HI> and then &s;ent to the King to de&s;ire him that the Army might march after; which was, in that ca&s;e, of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity; for the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had a part of his Army at <HI>Brentford,</HI> and the re&s;t at <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Acton,</HI> and <HI>Kingston.</HI> So that if the King had not advanced with His Body, tho&s;e who were before might very ea&s;ily have been compa&s;s'd in, and their Retreat made very difficult.</P>
<P>SO the King march'd with his whole Army towards <HI>Brentford,</HI> where <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King marches to|wards</HI> Brent|ford.</NOTE> were two Regiments of their be&s;t Foot (for &s;o they were accounted, be|ing tho&s;e who had eminently behaved them&s;elves at <HI>Edge-hill)</HI> having Barricadoed the narrow Avenues to the Town, and ca&s;t up &s;ome little Brea&s;t Works at the mo&s;t convenient places. Here a <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Regiment of the Kings, which had been faulty at <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> recover'd its Honour, and a&s;&s;aulted the Works, and forced the Barricadoes well defended by <MILESTONE N="30"> the Enemy. Then the King's Forces enter'd the Town after a very warm &s;ervice, the chief Officers, and many Soldiers of the other &s;ide be|ing kill'd; and they took there above five hundred Pri&s;oners, eleven Colours, and fifteen pieces of Cannon, and good &s;tore of Ammunition. But this Victory (for con&s;idering the place it might well be call'd &s;o) proved not at all fortunate to his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>THE two Hou&s;es were &s;o well &s;atisfied with the An&s;wer their Com|mittee had brought from the King, and with the report they made of his Maje&s;ties clemency, and gracious reception of them, that they had &s;ent order to their Forces, <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould not exerci&s;e any Act of&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> Ho&s;tility towards the King's Forces;</Q> and, at the &s;ame time, di&s;patch'd a Me&s;&s;enger, to acquaint his Maje&s;ty therewith, and to de&s;ire <Q>&startq;that&endq; there might be the like forbearance on His part.</Q> The Me&s;&s;enger found both Parties engaged at <HI>Brentford,</HI> and &s;o return'd without attending his Maje&s;ty, who had no apprehen&s;ion that they intended any Ce&s;&s;ation; &s;ince tho&s;e Forces were advanced to <HI>Brentford, Acton,</HI> and <HI>Kingston,</HI> af|ter their Committee was &s;ent to <HI>Colebrook.</HI> However they look'd upon this entering of <HI>Brentford</HI> as a &s;urpri&s;e contrary to Faith, and the be|traying their Forces to a Ma&s;&s;acre, under the &s;pecious pretence of a Treaty for Peace. <Q>The Alarm came to <HI>London,</HI> with the &s;ame terror as if <MILESTONE N="50"> the Army were enter'd their Gates, and the King accu&s;ed &startq;of Treachery, Perfidy, and Blood; and that he had given the &s;poil and wealth of the&endq; City as Pillage to his Army, which advanced with no other purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="58" REF="760">
THEY who believ'd nothing of tho&s;e Calumnies, were not yet willing the King &s;hould enter the City with an Army, which, they knew, would not be govern'd in &s;o rich Quarters; and therefore, with un&s;peakable expedition, the Army under the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was not only drawn to|gether, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex<HI>'s Army, and the City Train'd-bands oppo&s;ed again&s;t them.</HI></NOTE> but all the Train'd-bands of <HI>London</HI> led out in their brighte&s;t equipage upon the Heath next <HI>Brentford;</HI> where they had indeed a full Army of Hor&s;e and Foot, fit to have decided the Title of a Crown with an equal adver&s;ary. The View and Pro&s;pect of this &s;trength, which no|thing but that &s;uddain exigent could have brought together, extremely puffed them up; not only as it was an ample &s;ecurity again&s;t the pre|&s;ent <MILESTONE N="10"> danger, but as it look'd like a &s;afe power to encounter any other. They had now before their Eyes the King's little handful of Men, and then begun to wonder and blu&s;h at their own fears; and all this might be without exce&s;s of Courage; for without doubt their numbers then, without the advantage of equipage (which to Soldiers is a great addi|tion of Mettle) were five times greater than the Kings, harra&s;&s;ed, Wea|ther-beaten, and half|&s;tarved Troops.</P>
<P><Q>I HAVE heard many knowing Men, and &s;ome who were then in the City Regiments, &s;ay, &startq;that if the King had advanced, and charged that Ma&s;&s;ive body, it had pre&s;ently given ground; and that the King had <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;o great a Party in every Regiment, that they would have made no&endq; re&s;i&s;tance.</Q> But it had been madne&s;s, which no &s;ucce&s;s could have vin|dicated, to have made that attempt: and the King ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd that he had brought him&s;elf into &s;treights and difficulties, which would be hardly ma&s;ter'd, and expo&s;ed his Victorious Army to a view, at too near a di&s;tance off his two Enemies, the Parliament and the City. Yet he &s;tood all that day in Battalia to receive them, who only played upon him with their Cannon, to the lo&s;s only of four or five Hor&s;es, and not one Man. The con&s;titution of their Forces, where there were very many not at all affected to the Company they were in, being a good argument <MILESTONE N="30"> to Them not to charge the King, which had been an ill one to Him to charge Them.</P>
<P>WHEN the evening drew on, and it appear'd that great Body &s;tood <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Army drawn off to</HI> King|&s;ton.</NOTE> only for the defence of the City, the King appointed his Army to draw off to <HI>Kingston,</HI> which the Rebels had kindly quitted; which they did without the lo&s;s of a Man; and him&s;elf went to his own Hou&s;e at <HI>Hampton-</HI>Court; where he re&s;ted the next day, as well to refre&s;h his Army, even tired with watching and fa&s;ting, as to expect &s;ome Propo|&s;itions from the Hou&s;es. For, upon his advance to <HI>Brentford,</HI> he had &s;ent a Servant of his own, one M^r <HI>White,</HI> with a Me&s;&s;age to the Parlia|ment, <Q>containing the rea&s;ons of that motion (there being no Ce&s;&s;ation offer'd on Their part) and de&s;iring &startq;the Propo&s;itions might be di&s;patch'd&endq; to him with all &s;peed.</Q> But his Me&s;&s;enger, being carried to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> was by him u&s;ed very roughly, and by the Hou&s;es committed to the Gate-hou&s;e, not without the motion of &s;ome Men, <Q>&startq;that he&endq; might be executed as a Spy.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER a days &s;tay at <HI>Hampton-</HI>Court, the King removed him&s;elf to his Hou&s;e at <HI>Otelands,</HI> leaving the gro&s;s of his Army &s;till at <HI>Kingston,</HI> and thereabouts; but being then inform'd of the high imputations they had laid upon him; <Q>&startq;of breach of Faith, by his march to <HI>Brentford;</HI> and that the City was really inflamed with an opinion, that he meant to have &s;urpri&s;ed them, and to have &s;acked the Town; that they were &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with that fear, and apprehen&s;ion, that their care and pre
<PB N="59" REF="770">
paration for their &s;afety would at lea&s;t keep off all Propo&s;itions for&endq; Peace, whil&s;t the Army lay &s;o near <HI>London:</HI> He gave direction for all his Forces to retire to <HI>Reading;</HI></Q> fir&s;t di&s;charging all the Common Sol|diers, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Reading.</NOTE> who had been taken Pri&s;oners at <HI>Brentford</HI> (except &s;uch who Vo|luntarily offer'd to &s;erve him) upon their Oaths that they would no more bear Armes again&s;t his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P><Q>THE King then &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;es, in which &startq;he took no|tice <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;ends a Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;es.</NOTE> of tho&s;e unju&s;t and unrea&s;onable imputations rai&s;ed on him; told them again of the rea&s;ons and circum&s;tances of his motion towards <HI>Brentford;</HI> of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s drawing out his Forces towards him, <MILESTONE N="10"> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Quarters about him, and allmo&s;t hemming him in, after the time that the Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;ent to him with the Peti|tion; that he had never heard of the lea&s;t overture of the forbearing all Acts of Ho&s;tility, but &s;aw the contrary practiced by Them by that advance; that he had not the lea&s;t thought or intention of ma&s;tering the City by Force, or carrying his Army thither: That he wonder'd to hear his Soldiers charged with thir&s;ting after blood, when they took above five hundred Pri&s;oners in the very heat of the Fight. He told them &s;uch were mo&s;t apt, and likely to maintain their Power by blood and rapine, who had only got it by Oppre&s;&s;ion and Inju&s;tice; that His <MILESTONE N="20"> was ve&s;ted in him by the Law, and by that only (if the de&s;tructive Coun&s;els of others did not hinder &s;uch a Peace, in which that might once again be the univer&s;al rule, and in which only Religion and Ju|&s;tice could flouri&s;h) he de&s;ired to maintain it: that he intended to march to &s;uch a di&s;tance from his City of <HI>London</HI> as might take away all pretence of apprehen&s;ion from his Army, that might hinder them from preparing their Propo&s;itions, in all &s;ecurity, to be pre&s;ented to him; and there he would be ready to receive them, or, if that expe|dient plea&s;ed them not, to end the Pre&s;&s;ures and Mi&s;eries, which his Subjects, to his great grief, &s;uffer'd through this War, by a pre&s;ent&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> Battle.</Q></P>
<P>BUT as the Armies being &s;o near <HI>London</HI> was an Argument again&s;t a pre&s;ent Treaty, &s;o its remove to <HI>Reading</HI> was a greater with very ma|ny not to de&s;ire any. The danger, which they had brought them&s;elves for &s;ome days together to look upon at their Gates, was now to be con|temn'd at the di&s;tance of thirty miles; and this retreat imputed only to the fear of their power, not to the inclinations to Peace. And therefore they, who during the time that the Major part did really de&s;ire a good Peace, and whil&s;t overtures were preparing to that purpo&s;e, had the skill to intermingle Acts more de&s;tructive to it, than any Propo&s;itions <MILESTONE N="40"> could be contributory (as the inviting the <HI>Scots</HI> to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance by that Declaration, which is before mention'd; and the publi&s;hing a De|claration at the &s;ame time, which had lain long by them, in reply to one &s;et forth by the King long before in An&s;wer to theirs of the 26^t^h of <HI>May,</HI> in which they u&s;ed both his Per&s;on and his Power with more irre|verence than they had ever done before) now only in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;ur|pri&s;e, as they call'd it, of <HI>Brentford;</HI> and publi&s;hed, by the Authority of both Hou&s;es, a relation of the carriage of the King's Soldiers in that Town after their Victory (which they framed upon the di&s;cour&s;es of the Country People, who po&s;&s;ibly, as it could not be otherwi&s;e, had receiv'd <MILESTONE N="50"> damage by their Licence then) to make the King and his Army odious to the Kingdom; <Q>&startq;&endq;as affecting nothing but blood and rapine;</Q> <Q>and con|cluding, &startq;that there could not be rea&s;onably expected any good condi|tions

<P>THEIR Tru&s;ty Lord Mayor of <HI>London, I&s;aack Pennington,</HI> who was again cho&s;en to &s;erve another year, &s;o be&s;tir'd him&s;elf, having to a&s;&s;i&s;t him two Sheriffs, <HI>Langham</HI> and <HI>Andrews,</HI> as they could wi&s;h, that there was not only no more importunity or interpo&s;ition from the City for Peace; <Q>but, in&s;tead thereof, an Overture and Declaration from di|vers, <MILESTONE N="10"> under the &s;tyle of well affected Per&s;ons, &startq;that they would ad|vance a con&s;iderable number of Soldiers, for the &s;upply and recruit of the Parliament Forces; and would arme, maintain, and pay them for &s;everal months, or during the times of danger, and di&s;tractions; pro|vided that they might have the publick Faith of the Kingdom for re|payment of all &s;uch Sums of Money, which they &s;hould &s;o advance by&endq; way of Loan.</Q> <Q>This wonderful kind of propo&s;ition was pre&s;ently declared &startq;to be an acceptable &s;ervice to the King, Parliament, and&endq; Kingdom, and nece&s;&s;arily tending to the pre&s;ervation of them;</Q> and therefore an Ordinance, as they call it, was framed and pa&s;&s;ed both <MILESTONE N="20"> Hou&s;es:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;THAT all &s;uch as &s;hould furni&s;h Men, Money, Hor&s;e, or Armes <NOTE PLACE="marg">An Ordinance for rai&s;ing Money upon the publick faith.</NOTE> for that Service, &s;hould have the &s;ame fully repaid again, with In|tere&s;t for the forbearance thereof, from the times disbur&s;ed.

Upon this voluntary, general propo&s;ition, made by a few ob&s;cure Men, probably &s;uch who were not able to &s;upply much Money, was this Ordinance made; and from this Ordinance the Active Mayor, and Sheriffs, appointed a Committee of &s;uch Per&s;ons who&s;e inclinations they well knew, to pre&s;s all kind of Peo|ple, e&s;pecially tho&s;e who were not forward, to new Sub&s;criptions; and, by degrees, from this uncon&s;ider'd pa&s;&s;age, grew the monthly Tax of &s;ix thou&s;and pounds to be &s;et upon the City for the payment of the Army.</P>

<P>THE King was hardly &s;ettled in his Quarters, when he heard that the Parliament was fixing a Garri&s;on at <HI>Marlborough</HI> in <HI>Wilt-&s;hire,</HI> a <NOTE PLACE="marg">Malborough <HI>Garri&s;on'd by the Parlia|ment.</HI></NOTE> Town the mo&s;t notoriou&s;ly di&s;affected of all that County; otherwi&s;e, &s;aving the ob&s;tinacy and malice of the Inhabitants, in the Situation of it very unfit for a Garri&s;on.

This place, the King &s;aw, would &s;oon prove an ill Neighbour to him; not only as it was in the heart of a rich County, and &s;o would &s;treighten, and even infe&s;t his Quarters (for it was within twenty Miles of <HI>Oxford)</HI> but as it did cut off his Line of Communication with the We&s;t: And therefore, though it was <HI>December,</HI> a &s;ea&s;on, when his tired, and allmo&s;t naked Soldiers might expect re&s;t, he &s;ent a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;$, Foot, and Dragoons, under the Command of M^r <HI>Wilmot</HI> the Lieutenant General <MILESTONE N="20"> of his Hor&s;e, to vi&s;it that Town; who, coming thither on a <HI>Saturday,</HI> found the place &s;trongly Mann'd: for, be&s;ides the Garri&s;on, it being Market day, very many Country People came thither to buy and &s;ell, and were all compell'd to &s;tay and take Armes for the defence of the place; which, for the mo&s;t part, they were willing to do, and the Peo|ple peremptory to defend it. Though there was no Line about it, yet there were &s;ome places of great advantage, upon which they had rai&s;ed Batteries, and planted Cannon, and &s;o Barricadoed all the Avenues, which were through deep narrow Lanes, that the Hor&s;e could do lit|tle &s;ervice. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P><Q>WHEN the Lieutenant General was, with his Party, near the Town, he apprehended a fellow who confe&s;&s;ed upon examination, &startq;that he was a Spy, and &s;ent by the Governour to bring Intelligence of their &s;trength&endq; and motion.</Q> When all Men thought, and the poor fellow him&s;elf fear'd, he &s;hould be executed; the Lieutenant General cau&s;ed his whole Party to be ranged in order in the next convenient place, and bid the fellow look well upon them, and ob&s;erve them, and then bid him return to the Town, and tell tho&s;e that &s;ent him, what he had &s;een, and withal that he &s;hould acquaint the Magi&s;trates of the Town, <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould do well to treat with the Garri&s;on, to give them leave to &s;ubmit to <MILESTONE N="40"> the King; that if they did &s;o, the Town &s;hould not receive the lea&s;t prejudice; but if they compell'd him to make his way, and enter the Town by force, it would not be in his power to keep his Soldiers from&endq; taking that which they &s;hould win with their blood: and &s;o di&s;mi&s;s'd him.</Q> This generous Act proved of &s;ome advantage; for the fellow, tran&s;ported with having his life given him; and the Numbers of the Men he had &s;een, be&s;ides his no experience in &s;uch &s;ights, being multi|plied by his fear, made notable relations of the &s;trength, gallantry, and re&s;olution of the Enemy, and of the impo&s;&s;ibility of re&s;i&s;ting them; which, though it prevailed not with tho&s;e in Authority to yeild, yet it <MILESTONE N="$0"> &s;trangely abated the hopes, and courage of the People.

&s;o that the Foot had time to make room for the Hor&s;e, who were now enter'd at both ends of the Town, yet were not &s;o near an end as they expected; for the Streets were in many places Barricadoed, which were ob&s;tinately defended by &s;ome Soldiers and Town&s;men, who kill'd many Men out of the Windows of the Hou&s;es; &s;o that, it may be, if they had tru&s;ted only to their own &s;trength, without compelling the Country Men to encrea&s;e their Number, and who being fir&s;t frighted, and weary, di&s;hearten'd their companions, that place might have co&s;t more blood. <HI>Ram&s;ey</HI> the Governour was him&s;elf retired into the Church with &s;ome Officers, and from thence did &s;ome hurt; upon this, there being &s;o ma|ny <MILESTONE N="10"> kill'd out of Windows, fire was put to the next Hou&s;es, &s;o that a good part of the Town was burn'd, and then the Soldiers enter'd doing le&s;s execution than could rea&s;onably be expected; but, what they &s;pared in Blood, they took in Pillage, the Soldiers enquiring little who were friends or foes.</P>

<P>THE fir&s;t thing the King applied him&s;elf to con&s;ult upon, after he was &s;ettled in his Winter Quarters, and de&s;paired of any hone&s;t Over|tures for a Peace, was, how to apply &s;ome Antidote to that Poy&s;on, which was &s;ent into <HI>Scotland,</HI> in that Declaration We mention'd before; the which he had not only &s;een, as an Act communicated abroad and in <MILESTONE N="40"> many hands, but the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Earl of <HI>Lind&s;ey,</HI> who was then a Commi&s;|&s;ioner Leiger at <HI>London</HI> for <HI>Scotland,</HI> had pre&s;ented it to him.

For, of all his own Revenue, he had n$t yet the re|ceiving a penny within his power; neither did he think $it to compel <MILESTONE N="20"> any one, even &s;uch who were known to have contributed freely to the Parliament, to &s;upply him: Only by Letters, and all other gentle ways, he invited tho&s;e who were able, to con&s;ider how much their own &s;ecu|rity and pro&s;perity was concern'd, and depended upon the pre&s;ervation of His Rights; and offer'd to &s;ell any of his Lands, or to give any Per|&s;onal &s;ecurity for what&s;oever Money would be lent to him at Intere&s;t: for he had directed a Grant to be prepared of &s;everal Parks, and Forre&s;ts, and other Crown Lands, to many Per&s;ons of Honour and great Fortune about him, who&s;e E&s;tates and Reputation were well known; who were ready to be Per&s;onally bound for what&s;oever Sums could be borrow'd. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>

But they found the old Arguments of Popery, the Militia, and Delinquents, for the ju&s;ti|fication of the War, grew every day of le&s;s reverence with the People; and that as the King's own Religion was above any &s;candal they could lay upon it, &s;o the Regal power &s;eem'd &s;o a&s;&s;erted by Law, and the King, upon all occa&s;ions, cited particular Statutes for the Vindication of his Right, that whil&s;t they confe&s;s'd the Soveraign power to be ve&s;ted in him, all Legal Mini&s;ters had that dependence on him, that Their Au|thority would by degrees grow into contempt.</P>
<P>AND of this di&s;advantage the &s;ea&s;on of the year put them in mind: <MILESTONE N="10"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King makes new Skeriffs.</NOTE> for the King now, according to cour&s;e, prick'd Sheriffs, and made &s;uch choice in all Counties, that they fore&s;aw the People were not like to be &s;o implicitely at their di&s;po&s;al. <Q>Therefore, as they had before craftily in&s;inuated the &s;ame in &s;ome particulars, they now barefaced avow, &startq;that the Soveraign Power was wholely and entirely in Them; and that the&endq; King him&s;elf, &s;evered from Them, had no Regal Power in him.</Q> Their Clergy had hitherto been their Champions, and wre&s;ted the Scripture to their &s;en&s;e; their Lawyers were now to vindicate their Title, and they were not more mode&s;t in applying Their profe&s;&s;ion to their &s;ervice. As all places of Scripture, or in the Fathers, which were &s;poken of the <MILESTONE N="20"> Church of Chri&s;t, are by the Papi&s;ts applied to the Church of <HI>Rome;</HI> &s;o, what&s;oever is written in any of the Books of the Law, or mention'd in the Records, of the Authority and Effects of the Soveraign Power, and of the Dignity and Juri&s;diction of Parliament, was, by the&s;e Men, alledged and urged for the Power of the two Hou&s;es, and &s;ometimes for the &s;ingle Authority of the Hou&s;e of Commons. <Q>Being &s;upplied with the Learning of the&s;e Gentlemen, they declared, &startq;that the Sheriffs, then con&s;tituted by the King, were not Legal Sheriffs, nor ought to execute,&endq; or be &s;ubmitted to in that Office;</Q> and order'd, <Q>&startq;whom&s;oever the King&endq; made Sheriff in any County, to be &s;ent for as Delinquent;</Q> and becau&s;e <MILESTONE N="30"> it &s;eem'd unrea&s;onable, that the Counties &s;hould be without that Legal Mini&s;ter, to whom the Law had intru&s;ted it's Cu&s;tody, <Q>it was propo&s;ed &startq;that they might make a new great Seal, and by that Authority make&endq; Sheriffs, and &s;uch other Officers as they &s;hould find nece&s;&s;ary;</Q> but for the pre&s;ent that Motion was laid a&s;ide.</P>
<P>THE King had appointed &s;ome of tho&s;e Pri&s;oners who were taken in the Battle at <HI>Keinton</HI> field, and others apprehended in the Act of Re|bellion, to be Indicted of High Trea&s;on, upon the Statute of the 25^t^h year of King <HI>Edward</HI> the third, before the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice, and other Learned Judges of the Law, by Virtue of his Maje&s;ties Commi&s;&s;ion of <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer:</HI> <Q>The Parliament declared &startq;all &s;uch Indictments,&endq; and all Proceedings thereupon, to be unju&s;t, and illegal;</Q> and inhibited the Judges to proceed farther therein; <Q>declaring (which was a &s;tronger Argument) &startq;that if any Man were executed, or &s;uffer'd hurt, for any thing he had done by Their Order, the like puni&s;hment &s;hould be in|flicted, by death or otherwi&s;e, upon &s;uch Pri&s;oners as were, or &s;hould&endq; be, taken by Their Forces: And, in none of their ca&s;es, ever asked the Judges what the Law was.</Q> By the determination of the Statute, and the King's refu&s;al, which hath been mention'd before, to pa&s;s any new Law to that purpo&s;e, there was no farther duty of Tonnage and Poundage <MILESTONE N="50"> due upon Merchandize, and the Statute made this very Parliament in|volv'd all Men in the guilt and penalty of a premunire, who offer'd to receive it. <Q>The King publi&s;h'd a Proclamation upon that Statute, and

&startq;required all Men to forbear paying that duty, and forbid all to receive&endq; it.</Q> They again declared, <Q>&startq;that no Per&s;on, who receiv'd tho&s;e duties by Virtue of Their Orders, was within the danger of a premunire, or any other penalty what&s;oever; becau&s;e the intent, and meaning of that penal clau&s;e was only to re&s;train the Crown from impo&s;ing any duty or payment upon the Subjects, without their con&s;ent in Parlia|ment; and was not intended to extend to any ca&s;e whereunto the&endq; Lords and Commons give their a&s;&s;ent in Parliament.</Q></P>

been, in tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t influence upon his Coun&s;els, that they look'd more upon the prevailing of their own Party, than upon any tho&s;e great advantages both to his Crown, and Royal Per&s;on, which he might obtain by joyning with his People: and &s;o cunning were tho&s;e Factors for Popery, in pro&s;ecution of their own aimes, that they could put on a counterfeit Vi&s;age of Honour, Peace, and Great|ne&s;s, upon tho&s;e cour&s;es and coun&s;els, which had no truth, and reali|ty, but of Weakne&s;s, Di&s;honour, and Mi&s;eries to his Maje&s;ty, and the&endq; whole Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEY &s;aid, &startq;they had lately expre&s;s'd their earne&s;t inclinations to <MILESTONE N="10"> that National love and amity with the united Provinces, which had been nouri&s;h'd and confirm'd by &s;o many civil re&s;pects, and mutual intere&s;ts, as made it &s;o natural to them, that they had, this Parliament, in their humble Petition to his Maje&s;ty, de&s;ired, that they might be joyn'd with that State in a more near and &s;treight League, and Union: And they could not but expect &s;ome returns from Them, of the like expre&s;&s;ions: and that they would be &s;o far from blowing the fire, which begun to kindle among them, that they would rather endea|vour to quench it, by &s;trengthning and encouraging them who had no other de&s;ign but not to be de&s;troyed, and to pre&s;erve their Religion, <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;ave them&s;elves, and the other Reform'd Churches of <HI>Chri&s;tendom,</HI> from the Ma&s;&s;acres and Extirpations, with which the principles of the Roman Religion did threaten them all; which were begun to be acted in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and in the Hopes, and Endeavours, and Intentions of that Party, had long &s;ince been executed upon Them, if the Mer|cy, Favour, and Ble&s;&s;ing of Almighty God, had not &s;uperabounded, and prevented the &s;ubtlety and malignity of cruel, wicked, and blood|thir&s;ty&endq; Men.</Q></P>
<P>WITH this &s;pecious di&s;patch, in which were many other particulars to render the King's cau&s;e ungracious, and their own very plau&s;ible, <MILESTONE N="30"> their Agent, one <HI>Strickland,</HI> an ob&s;cure Gentleman, was receiv'd by the States; and, notwith&s;tanding the Queen was then there, and the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> vi&s;ibly inclined to a&s;&s;i&s;t the King with all his Intere&s;ts, and the Interpo&s;ition of the King's Re&s;ident, did not only hinder the States from giving the lea&s;t countenance to the King's cau&s;e, but really &s;o corrupted the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> in the Army, and in that Court, that there was nothing de&s;ign'd to advance it by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> him&s;elf (who with great genero&s;ity &s;upplied the King with Armes and Ammunition to a very con&s;iderable Value) or by the private activity and dexterity of particular Per&s;ons, out of their own Fortune, or by the &s;ale or pawn|ing <MILESTONE N="40"> of Jewels, but intelligence was given &s;oon enough to the Parliament, either to get &s;tops, and &s;eizures upon it, by Order of the State, or to intercept the &s;upply by their Navy at Sea. So that much more was in that manner, and by that means, taken and intercepted at Sea, than ever arrived at any Port within his Maje&s;ties obedience: of which at that time he had only one, the Harbour of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle.</HI> With the &s;ame &s;ucce&s;s, they &s;ent another Agent to <HI>Bru&s;&s;els,</HI> who prevailed with <HI>Don Franci&s;co de Melos,</HI> then Governour of <HI>Flanders,</HI> to di&s;countenance all|ways, and &s;ometimes to prevent the preparations which were there making by the King's Mini&s;ters. And in <HI>France</HI> they had another Agent, <MILESTONE N="50"> one <HI>Aulgier,</HI> a Man long before in the con&s;tant pay of the Crown; who though he was not receiv'd, and avow'd (to put the better varni&s;h upon their Profe&s;&s;ions to the King) by that Crown, did them more &s;ervice
<PB N="71" REF="890">
than either of the other; by how much more that People had an in|fluence upon the di&s;tempers of the three Kingdoms.</P>
<P>AND as the Parliament made all the&s;e addre&s;&s;es to Forreign States, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Inclina|tions of For|reign Kings, and States, in this cau&s;e be|tween the K$ng and Parliament.</NOTE> and Princes, which no Parliament had ever done before, &s;o it will be fit here to take notice how other Princes appear'd concern'd on the King's behalf. The <HI>Spaniard</HI> was &s;ufficiently incen&s;ed by the King's reception of the Emba&s;&s;adors of <HI>Portugal,</HI> and, which was more, entering into terms of Amity and League with that Crown, and had therefore con|tributed notable a&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and &s;ent both Armes, and Money thither. And, &s;ince the extravagances of this Par|liament, <MILESTONE N="10"> the Emba&s;&s;ador of <HI>Spain</HI> had made great application to them.</P>
<P>THE <HI>French,</HI> according to their Nature, were much more active, and more intent upon blowing the fire. The former commotions in <HI>Scotland</HI> had been rai&s;ed by the &s;pecial encouragement, if not con|trivance of the Cardinal <HI>Richelieu;</HI> who had carefully kept up, and en|larg'd the old Franchi&s;es of the <HI>Scots</HI> under that Crown; which made a very &s;pecious &s;hew of wonderful grace and benefit, at a di&s;tance, to that Nation, and was of little burthen to the <HI>French;</HI> and, in truth, of lit|tle advantage to tho&s;e who were in full po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of all tho&s;e Priviledges. Yet, by this means, the <HI>French</HI> have allways had a very great influence <MILESTONE N="20"> upon the Affections of that People, and opportunities to work great prejudice to that Crown: As nothing was more vi&s;ible than that, by the Cardinals Activity, all tho&s;e late di&s;tempers in <HI>Scotland</HI> were car|ried on till his death, and, by His Rules and Principles, afterwards: The <HI>French</HI> Mini&s;ters allways making their corre&s;pondence, with, and rela|tion to tho&s;e who were taken Notice to be of the <HI>Puritan</HI> Party; which was under&s;tood to be in order only to the oppo&s;ition of tho&s;e Coun&s;els, which &s;hould at any time be offer'd on the behalf of <HI>Spain.</HI></P>
<P>SINCE the beginning of this Parliament, the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, Moun&s;ieur <HI>la Fert&egrave;,</HI> di&s;&s;embled not to have notable familiarity with <MILESTONE N="30"> tho&s;e who govern'd mo&s;t in the two Hou&s;es; di&s;cover'd to them what|&s;oever he knew, or could rea&s;onably devi&s;e to the prejudice of the King's Coun&s;els and Re&s;olutions; and took all opportunities to le&s;&s;en, and un|dervalue the King's Regal Power, by applying him&s;elf on publick oc|ca&s;ions of State, and in his Ma&s;ters Name, and to improve his Intere&s;t, to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament (which had in no Age before been ever known) as in the bu&s;ine&s;s of Tran&s;portation of Men out of <HI>Ireland,</HI> be|fore remember'd; in which he cau&s;ed, by the importunity of the two Hou&s;es, his Maje&s;ties promi&s;e, and engagement to the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Emba&s;|&s;ador, to be render'd of no effect. And, after that, he formally exhibited, <MILESTONE N="40"> in writing, a Complaint to the two Hou&s;es again&s;t S^r <HI>Thomas Rowe,</HI> his Maje&s;ties extraordinary Emba&s;&s;ador to the Emperor, and Princes of <HI>Germany,</HI> upon the Treaty of an accommodation on the behalf of the Prince Elector and re&s;titution of the <HI>Palatinate,</HI> <Q>confidently avowing, &startq;that S^r <HI>Thomas Rowe</HI> had offer'd, on the King's part, to enter into a League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive with the Hou&s;e of <HI>Au&s;tria,</HI> and to&endq; wed all their Intere&s;ts;</Q> and, in plain terms, asked them, <Q>&startq;whether&endq; They had given S^r <HI>Thomas</HI> in&s;tructions to that purpo&s;e?</Q> expre&s;&s;ing a great value his Ma&s;ter had of the Affection of the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> <Q>which drew them to a return of much, and unu&s;ual civility, and to <MILESTONE N="50"> a&s;&s;ure the <HI>French</HI> King, &startq;that S^r <HI>Thomas Rowe</HI> had no &s;uch In&s;tructions from Them; and that they would examine the truth of it; and would be careful that nothing &s;hould be done, and perfected in that Treaty
<PB N="72" REF="900">
&endq; which might reflect upon the good of the <HI>French</HI> King.</Q> Whereas in truth there was not the lea&s;t ground, or pretence for that &s;ugge&s;tion; S^r <HI>Thomas Rowe</HI> having never made any &s;uch offer, or any thing like it. And when, after his return out of <HI>Germany,</HI> he expo&s;tulated with the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, for &s;uch an injurious, cau&s;le&s;s information, he an|&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;that his Ma&s;ter had receiv'd &s;uch adverti&s;ement, and had given&endq; him order to do what he did.</Q> So that it ea&s;ily appear'd, it was only a fiction of State, whereby they took occa&s;ion to publi&s;h, that they would take any opportunity to re&s;ort to the two Hou&s;es, and thereby to flatter them in their u&s;urpation of any Soveraign Authority. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THERE is not a &s;adder con&s;ideration than this Pa&s;&s;ion, and Inju&s;tice, in Chri&s;tian Princes (and I pray God the Almighty Ju&s;tice be not angry, on this account, with the Government of Kings, Princes, and States) that they are &s;eldom &s;o Sollicitous that the Laws be executed, Ju&s;tice admini&s;tred, and Order perform'd within their own Kingdoms, as they are that all three may be di&s;turbed, and confounded among&s;t their Neigh|bours. And there is no &s;ooner a &s;park of Di&s;&s;ention, a di&s;compo&s;ure in Affections, a jealou&s;y in Under&s;tandings, di&s;cern'd to be in a Neighbour Province, or Kingdom, to the hazarding the Peace thereof, but they, though in League and Amity, with their utmo&s;t Art and Indu&s;try, make <MILESTONE N="20"> it their bu&s;ine&s;s to kindle that &s;park into a flame, and to contract and ripen all un&s;ettled humours, and jealous Apprehen&s;ions, into a perem|ptory di&s;content, and all di&s;content to Sedition, and all Sedition to open and profe&s;&s;ed Rebellion. And they have rarely &s;o ample &s;atisfaction in their own greatne&s;s, or &s;o great a &s;en&s;e and value of Gods ble&s;&s;ing upon them, as when they have been In&s;truments of drawing &s;ome notorious Calamity upon their Neighbours. As if the Religion of Princes were nothing but Policy, and that they con&s;ider'd nothing more, than to make all other Kingdoms but their own mi&s;erable: and becau&s;e God hath re|&s;erv'd them to be try'd only within his own Juri&s;diction, and before his <MILESTONE N="30"> own Tribunal, that he means to try them too by other Laws, and Rules, than he hath publi&s;h'd to the world for his Servants to walk by. Whereas they ought to con&s;ider, that God hath placed them over his People as Examples, and to give countenance to his Laws by their own &s;trict ob&s;ervation of them; and that as their Subjects are to be defended, and protected by their Princes, &s;o They them&s;elves are to be a&s;&s;i&s;ted and &s;upported by one another; the function of Kings being an Order by it &s;elf: and as a contempt and breach of every Law is, in the Policy of State, an Offence again&s;t the Per&s;on of the King, becau&s;e there is a kind of violation offer'd to his Per&s;on in the tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion of that Rule <MILESTONE N="40"> without which he cannot govern; &s;o the Rebellion of Subjects again&s;t their Prince ought to be look'd upon, by all other Kings, as an A&s;&s;ault of their own Soveraignty, and, in &s;ome degree, a de&s;ign again&s;t Monar|chy it &s;elf; and con&s;equently to be &s;uppre&s;&s;ed, and extirpated, in what other Kingdom &s;oever it is, with the like concernment as if it were in their own Bowels.</P>
<P>BESIDES the&s;e indirect Artifices, and Activity before mention'd in the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;ador, very many of the <HI>Hugonots</HI> in <HI>France</HI> (with whom this Crown heretofore, it may be, kept too much corre&s;pondence) were declared Enemies to the King; and, in publick, and in &s;ecret, gave <MILESTONE N="50"> all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;i&s;tance to tho&s;e who&s;e bu&s;ine&s;s was to de&s;troy the Church.

Enemies; &s;o the occa&s;ion, from whence tho&s;e di&s;affections grew, was very unskilfully and imprudently admini&s;ter'd by the State here.

<P>WHEN the Reformation of Religion fir&s;t begun in <HI>England,</HI> in the time of King <HI>Edward</HI> the &s;ixth, very many, out of <HI>Germany</HI> and <HI>France,</HI> le&s;t their Countries, where the Reformation was &s;everely per&s;ecuted, <MILESTONE N="10"> and tran&s;planted them&s;elves, their Families, and E&s;tates, into <HI>England,</HI> where they were receiv'd very ho&s;pitably; and that King, with great Piety and Policy, by &s;everal Acts of State, granted them many Indem|nities, and the free u&s;e of Churches in <HI>London</HI> for the exerci&s;e of their Religion: whereby the Number of them encrea&s;ed; and the benefit to the Kingdom, by &s;uch an acce&s;s of Trade, and improvement of Manu|factures, was very con&s;iderable. Which Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> finding, and well knowing that other notable u&s;es of them might be made, enlarg'd their Priviledges by new Conce&s;&s;ions; drawing, by all means, great Numbers over, and &s;uffering them to erect Churches, and to enjoy the <MILESTONE N="20"> exerci&s;e of their Religion after their own manner, and according to their own Ceremonies, in all places, where, for the conveniency of their Trade, they cho&s;e to re&s;ide. And &s;o they had Churches in <HI>Norwich, Canterbury,</HI> and other places of the Kingdom, as well as in <HI>London;</HI> whereby the Wealth of tho&s;e places marvellou&s;ly encrea&s;$d. And be|&s;ides the benefit from thence, the Queen made u&s;e of them in her great Tran&s;actions of State in <HI>France,</HI> and the Low Countries, and by the mediation and interpo&s;ition of tho&s;e People, kept an u&s;eful Intere&s;t in that Party, in all the Forreign Dominions where they were tolerated. The &s;ame Charters of Liberty were continued and granted to them, <MILESTONE N="30"> during the peaceable Reign of King <HI>James,</HI> and in the beginning of this King's Reign, although, it may be, the politick con&s;iderations in tho&s;e Conce&s;&s;ions, and Connivances, were neither made u&s;e of, nor under|&s;tood.</P>
<P>SOME few years before the&s;e Troubles, when the power of Church Men grew more tran&s;cendent, and indeed the Faculties and Under&s;tand|ings of the Lay Coun&s;ellors more dull, lazy, and unactive (for without the la&s;t, the fir&s;t could have done no hurt) the Bi&s;hops grew jealous that the countenancing another Di&s;cipline of the Church here, by Order of the State (for tho&s;e Forreign Congregations were govern'd by a Presby|tery <MILESTONE N="40"> according to the Cu&s;tom, and Con&s;titution of tho&s;e parts of which they had been Natives: the <HI>French, Dutch,</HI> and <HI>Walloons,</HI> had the free u&s;e of &s;everal Churches according to their own di&s;cipline) would at lea&s;t dimini&s;h the Reputation and Dignity of the Epi&s;copal Government, and give &s;ome countenance to the Factious, and Schi&s;matical Party in <HI>England</HI> to hope for &s;uch a toleration.</P>

All voluntary Loans were a$ an end, and the publick Faith thought a &s;ecurity not to be relied on, and by how much greater the difficulty was, by &s;o much the more fatal would the &s;inking under it prove; and therefore it was with the more Vigour to be re&s;i&s;ted.

<P>THE truth is, the King was not &s;orry to &s;ee this Ordinance, which he thought &s;o prodigious, that he &s;hould have been a greater Gainer by it than they that made it; &s;eeing it was &s;o palpable, and clear a de|mon&s;tration of the Tyranny the People were to live under, that they would ea&s;ily have di&s;cern'd the change of their condition: yet he took <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;o much pains, to awaken his Subjects to a due apprehen&s;ion of it, and to apply the thorough con&s;ideration of it to them, that he publi&s;h'd a Declaration upon that Ordinance; the which, pre&s;enting many things to them, which have &s;ince fallen out, may be, in this place, fit to be in&s;erted in the King's own words, which were the&s;e:</P>
<P><Q>&startq;IT would not be believ'd (at lea&s;t great pains have been taken that <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Maje&s;ties Declaration upon occa&s;ion of the former Ordinance.</NOTE> it might not) that the pretended Ordinance of the Militia (the fir&s;t attempt that ever was, to make a Law by Ordinance, without Our con&s;ent) or the keeping us out of <HI>Hull,</HI> and taking Our Armes and <MILESTONE N="40"> Ammunition from us, could any way concern the Intere&s;t, Property, or Liberty of the Subject: And it was confe&s;s'd, by that de&s;perate De|claration it &s;elf of the 26^t^h of <HI>May,</HI> that if they were found guilty of that charge of de&s;troying the Title and Intere&s;t of Our Subjects to their Lands, and Goods, it were indeed a very great crime.

But Men mu&s;t be condemn'd to a &s;trange unthriftine&s;s, who will lend upon &s;uch &s;ecurity.

<P>THOUGH this Petition was in effect no other than to de&s;ire the King to disband his Army, and to put him&s;elf into the ab&s;olute di&s;po&s;al of the Parliament, and therefore all wi&s;e Men concluded that no great Pro|gre&s;s would be made by it towards Peace; yet &s;o &s;otted and infatuated were the People, that, upon this very Petition, they were prevailed <MILESTONE N="20"> with to &s;ubmit to another Sub&s;cription for Money, and Plate, for the nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ion of Armes, Ammunition, and Pay of their Army, until their disbanding and return home to their &s;everal Counties: that &s;o they might not be occa&s;ioned, through want of Pay, to Plunder, Rob, or Pillage by the way homewards, after their di&s;charge and di&s;mi&s;&s;ion.

AT la&s;t, a day was appointed: and, at the &s;ame time, a Committee of the Lords and Commons were &s;ent to be pre&s;ent, to &s;ee that it might not have &s;uch a reception, as might render their Intere&s;t &s;u&s;pected. <Q>A&s;&s;oon as the Gentleman &s;ent by the King had read his Maje&s;ties An&s;wer, the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> told them, &startq;of the high value the Parliament had of the City; that they had con&s;ider'd of tho&s;e wounding A&s;per&s;ions, which, in that An&s;wer, were ca&s;t upon Per&s;ons of &s;uch eminent Af|fection in their City, and upon others, of great fidelity and tru&s;t among them: That they own'd them&s;elves to be equally intere&s;&s;ed in all things that concern'd them, and would &s;tand by them with their Lives, <MILESTONE N="10"> and Fortunes, for the pre&s;ervation of the City in general, and tho&s;e Per&s;ons in particular who had been faithful, and de&s;erv'd well both of the Parliament, and Kingdom.

<P>ASSOON as his Lord&s;hip had fini&s;h'd his Oration, which was re|ceiv'd with marvellous Acclamations, M^r <HI>Pym</HI> enlarged him&s;elf, in a Speech then printed, upon the &s;everal parts of the King's An&s;wer (for it was &s;o long before it was deliver'd, that the printed Copies from <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> which were printed there after the Me&s;&s;enger was gone &s;o long that all Men concluded it was deliver'd, were publick and in all hands) and told them the &s;en&s;e of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, upon every part of it. <Q>Among the re&s;t, &startq;that the demanding the Lord Mayor, and the other three Citizens, was again&s;t the Priviledge of Parliament (two of them being Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons) and mo&s;t di&s;ho|nourable to the City, that the Lord Mayor of <HI>London</HI> &s;hould be &s;ub|jected to the violence of every ba&s;e Fellow; and that they &s;hould be commanded to deliver up their chief Magi&s;trates, and &s;uch eminent Members of the City, to the King's plea&s;ure, only becau&s;e they had <MILESTONE N="30"> done their duty, in adhering to the Parliament, for the defence of the&endq; Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE told them, &startq;that, to the objection that the Government of the City had been managed by a few de&s;perate Per&s;ons, and that they did exerci&s;e an Arbitrary Power, the two Hou&s;es gave them this Te&s;ti|mony, that they had, in mo&s;t of the great occa&s;ions concerning the Government of the City, follow'd Their direction; and that direction which the Parliament had given, They had executed; and they mu&s;t, and would maintain to be &s;uch, as &s;tood with Their honour in giving&endq; it, and the others tru&s;t, and fidelity in performing it.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P><Q>TO the objection, &startq;that the Property of the Subject was de&s;troyed,&endq; by taking away the twentieth part by an Arbitrary Power,</Q> <Q>he told them, &startq;that that Ordinance did not require a twentieth part, but did limit the A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors that they &s;hould not go beyond a twentieth part, and that was done by a Power deriv'd from both Hou&s;es of Parliament; the Lords, who had an hereditary Intere&s;t in making of Laws in this Kingdom; and the Commons, who were elected and cho&s;en to repre|&s;ent the whole Body of the Commonalty, and tru&s;ted, for the good&endq; of the People, when ever they &s;ee cau&s;e, to charge the Kingdom.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid farther, &startq;that the &s;ame Law which did enable the two Hou&s;es <MILESTONE N="50"> of Parliament to rai&s;e Forces to maintain, and defend the &s;afety of Religion, and of the Kingdom, did likewi&s;e enable them to require contributions whereby tho&s;e Forces might be maintain'd; or el&s;e it

were a vain power to rai&s;e Forces, if they had not a power likewi&s;e to&endq; maintain them in that Service for which they were rai&s;ed.</Q> <Q>He ob|&s;erv'd, &startq;that it was reported, that the King declared he would &s;end &s;ome Me&s;&s;engers to ob&s;erve their carriage in the City, and what was done among them: the Parliament had ju&s;t cau&s;e to doubt, that tho&s;e would be Me&s;&s;engers of &s;edition, and trouble, and therefore de&s;ired them to ob&s;erve and find them out, that they might know who they&endq; were.</Q> <Q>He concluded with &startq;commending unto their con&s;ideration, the great danger that they were all in; and that the danger could not be&endq; kept off, in all likelyhood, but by the Army that was then on foot;</Q> <Q>and a&s;&s;ured them, &startq;that the Lords and Commons were &s;o far from be|ing <MILESTONE N="10"> frighted by any thing, in that An&s;wer, that they had, for Them|&s;elves, and the Members of both Hou&s;es, declared a farther contribu|tion, towards the maintenance of that Army; and could not but hope, and de&s;ire, that the City, which had &s;hew'd &s;o much good Affection in the former nece&s;&s;ities of the State, would be &s;en&s;ible of their own, and of the condition of the whole Kingdom, and add to that which they had already done, &s;ome farther Contribution, whereby that Ar|my&endq; might be maintain'd for all their &s;afeties.</Q></P>
<P>WHETHER the &s;olemnity for the reception of this Me&s;&s;age after it <MILESTONE N="20"> was known what the contents were, and the bringing &s;o great a Guard of arm'd Men to the place where it was to be deliver'd, frighted the well affected Party of the City from coming thither, or frighted them, when they were there, from expre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Affections, I know not. But it is certain, the&s;e Speeches and Di&s;cour&s;es were receiv'd, and entertain'd with all imaginable applau&s;e, and that meeting was concluded with a general Acclamation, <Q>&startq;&endq;that they would live, and die with the Hou&s;es, and other expre&s;&s;ions of that nature.</Q> So that all thoughts of farther Addre&s;s, or complyance with his Maje&s;ty from the City, were &s;o en|tirely and ab&s;olutely laid a&s;ide, that the Licence of Seditious and Trea|&s;onable <MILESTONE N="30"> di&s;cour&s;es daily encrea&s;ed; <Q>in&s;omuch, that complaint being made to the then Lord Mayor, that a certain de&s;perate Per&s;on, had &s;aid, &startq;that&endq; he hoped &s;hortly to wa&s;h his hands in the King's blood, that Mini&s;ter of Ju&s;tice refu&s;ed to &s;end any Warrant, or to give any direction to any Officer, for the apprehen&s;ion of him.</Q> This was the &s;ucce&s;s of that Pe|tition, and An&s;wer.</P>
<P>THE Hou&s;es now began to &s;peak Them&s;elves, of &s;ending Propo&s;i|tions to the King for Peace. For, how great &s;oever the complyance &s;eem'd with them from the City, or the Country, they well enough di&s;|cern'd that complyance was generally upon the hope and expectation <MILESTONE N="40"> that they would procure a &s;peedy Peace. And they had now procured that to pa&s;s both Hou&s;es, which they only wanted, the Bill for the ex|tirpation of Epi&s;copacy: in the doing whereof, they u&s;ed marvellous Art, and Indu&s;try. They who, every day, did &s;omewhat, how little &s;o|ever then taken notice of, to make Peace impo&s;&s;ible, and re&s;olv'd, that no Peace could be &s;afe for Them, but &s;uch a one as would be un&s;afe for the King, well enough knew that they &s;hould never be able to hold up, and carry on the War again&s;t the King in <HI>England,</HI> but by the help of an Army out of <HI>Scotland;</HI> which they had no hope to procure but upon the Stock of the Alteration of the Government of the Church; to which <MILESTONE N="50"> that Nation was violently inclined. But to compa&s;s That, was very difficult; very much the Major part, even of tho&s;e Members who &s;till continued with them, being cordially Affected to the Government e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd,
<PB N="90" REF="1110">
at lea&s;t not affected to any Other. To tho&s;e therefore, who were &s;o far engaged as to de&s;ire to have it in Their power to compel the King to con&s;ent to &s;uch a Peace as they de&s;ired, they repre&s;ented, <Q>&startq;the con|&s;equence of getting the <HI>Scots</HI> to declare for them; which would more terrify the King, and keep the Northern parts in Subjection more, than any Forces they &s;hould be able to rai&s;e: That it was impo&s;&s;ible to draw &s;uch a Declaration from them, without fir&s;t declaring them|&s;elves that they would alter the Government by the Bi&s;hops; which that People pretended to believe the only ju&s;tifiable ground to take up&endq; Armes.</Q> To others, which was indeed their publick, and avow'd, and <MILESTONE N="10"> current Argument in debates, they alledged, <Q>&startq;that they could not ex|pect that any Peace would be effected by the King's free concurrence to any Me&s;&s;age they could &s;end to him, but that it mu&s;t ari&s;e, and re|&s;ult from a Treaty between them, upon &s;uch Propo&s;itions as either Party would make upon their own Intere&s;t: that it could not be ex|pected that &s;uch Propo&s;itions would be made on either &s;ide, as would be pertinaciou&s;ly in&s;i&s;ted on by them who made them; it being the cour&s;e, in all Affairs of this Nature, to ask more than was expected to be con&s;ented to; that it concern'd Them as much, to make demands of great Moment to the King, from which they meant to recede, as <MILESTONE N="20"> others upon which they mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t: that all Men knew the inclination and affection the King had to the Church, and therefore if he &s;aw That in danger, he would re&s;cue it at any price, and very probably their departing from their Propo&s;ition concerning the Church, might be the mo&s;t powerful Argument to the King, to gratify them with the&endq; Militia.</Q></P>
<P><Q>By the&s;e Artifices, and e&s;pecially by concluding ob&s;tinately, &startq;that no Propo&s;itions &s;hould be &s;ent to the King for Peace, till the Bill for&endq; extirpation of Bi&s;hops was pa&s;s'd the Lords Hou&s;e (where it would never otherwi&s;e have been &s;ubmitted to) they had their de&s;ire;</Q> and, <MILESTONE N="30"> about the end of <HI>January,</HI> they &s;ent the Earls of <HI>Northumberland, Pem|broke,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ent to the King with Propo&s;itions of Peace about the end of</HI> January.</NOTE> <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> with eight Members of the Commons to <HI>Oxford,</HI> with their Petition and Propo&s;itions.

the name of a Parliament, and a prejudice to the power of the Court; yet a full &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and Love of the e&s;tabli&s;h'd Government of Church and State, e&s;pecially to that part of the Church as concern'd the Liturgy or Book of Common Prayer, which was a mo&s;t general ob|ject of Veneration with the People. And the jealou&s;y, and apprehen|&s;ion that the other Party intended to alter it, was a principal advance|ment of the King's Service. Though the Major, and mo&s;t con&s;iderable part of the Gentry, and Men of E&s;tates, were heartily for the King, many of them being of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and &s;o having &s;een, and ob|&s;erv'd by what &s;pirit the di&s;temper was begot, and carried on; yet there <MILESTONE N="10"> were others of Name, Fortune, and Reputation with the People, very &s;ollicitous for the Parliament, and more active than the other. There was a Third &s;ort (for a Party they cannot be call'd) greater than either of the other, both of Fortune, and Number, who, though they were &s;a|tisfied in their Con&s;ciences of the ju&s;tice of the King's cau&s;e, had yet &s;o great a dread of the power of the Parliament, that they &s;at &s;till as Neu|ters, a&s;&s;i&s;ting neither. So that they who did boldly appear, and declare for the King, were compell'd to proceed with all warine&s;s, and circum|&s;pection; by the known and well under&s;tood Rules of the Law, and Ju&s;tice; and dur&s;t not oppo&s;e the mo&s;t extravagant Act of the other Side <MILESTONE N="20"> but with all the formality that was u&s;ed in full Peace: Which mu&s;t be an An&s;wer to all tho&s;e over&s;ights, and omi&s;&s;ions, which Po&s;terity will be apt to impute to the King, in the morning of the&s;e Di&s;tractions.</P>
<P>THE Committee of the Parliament, who were entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> and believ'd them&s;elves Ma&s;ters of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> drew their Forces of the Country to <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> to be &s;ure that S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> and his Adherents (who&s;e power they thought contemptible) might not e&s;cape out of their hands. This was before the Battle of <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> when the King was at lowe&s;t, and when the Authority of Parliament found little oppo&s;ition in any place. <Q>The Quarter Se&s;&s;ions came, where they <MILESTONE N="30"> cau&s;ed a Pre&s;entment to be drawn, in form of Law, &startq;again&s;t divers Men unknown, who were lately come arm'd into that County <HI>contra&endq;</HI> <HI>pacem</HI> &amp;c.</Q> Though none were named, all under&s;tood Who were meant; and therefore S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> who very well under&s;tood tho&s;e pro|ceedings, voluntarily appeared; took notice of the pre&s;entment, and produced the Commi&s;&s;ion granted by the King, under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> to the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> by which he was con&s;tituted General of the We&s;t; and a Commi&s;&s;ion, from his Lord&s;hip, to S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> of Lieutenant General of the Hor&s;e; <Q>and told them, &startq;he was &s;ent to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, in the defence of their Liberties, again&s;t all illegal&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> Taxes, and Impo&s;itions.</Q> Hereupon, after a full and &s;olemn debate, the Jury, which con&s;i&s;ted of Gentlemen of good Quality, and Fortunes in the County, not only acquitted S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> and all the other Gentlemen his Companions, of any di&s;turbance of the Peace; <Q>but de|clared, &startq;that it was a great &s;avour, and ju&s;tice of his Maje&s;ty, to &s;end down aid to them who were already mark'd out to de&s;truction; and that they thought it the duty of every good Subject, as well in Loyal|ty to the King, as in gratitude to tho&s;e Gentlemen, to joyn with them&endq; with any hazard of Life and Fortune.</Q></P>
<P><Q>As this full vindication was thus gotten on the King's part, &s;o an Indictment was prefer'd again&s;t S^r <HI>Alexander Carew,</HI> S^r <HI>Richard Buller,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Committee, &startq;for a Rout and unlawful A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Launce&s;ton;</HI> and for Riots and Mi&s;demeanours committed again&s;t many

&endq; of the King's good Subjects, in taking their Liberties from them (for they had intercepted,</Q> and apprehended divers Me&s;&s;engers, and others of the King's Party, and employed by them) This Indictment and In|formation was found by the Grand Jury, and thereupon, according to a Statute in that ca&s;e provided, an Order of Se&s;&s;ions was granted to the High Sheriff, a Per&s;on well affected to the King's Service, <Q>&startq;to rai&s;e the <HI>po&s;se Comitatus,</HI> for the di&s;per&s;ing that unlawful A&s;&s;embly at <HI>Laun|ceston,&endq;</HI> and for the apprehen&s;ion of the Rioters.</Q> This was the Ri&s;e and Foundation of all the great Service that was after perform'd in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> by which the whole We&s;t was reduced to the King. For, by <MILESTONE N="10"> this means, there were immediately drawn together a Body of three thou&s;and Foot, well arm'd; which by no other means could have been done: with which S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> whom they all willingly obeyed, advanced towards <HI>Launceston,</HI> where the Committee had fortified, and from thence had &s;ent Me&s;&s;ages of great contempt upon the proceedings of the Se&s;&s;ions; for be&s;ides their confidence in their own <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> &s;trength, they had a good Body of Hor&s;e to &s;econd them upon all occa&s;ions, in the Confines of <HI>Devon.</HI></P>
<P>SIR <HI>George Chudliegh</HI> a Gentleman of good Fortune, and Reputation in that County, and very active for the Militia, being then at <HI>Tavistock,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> with five or &s;ix full Troops of Hor&s;e, rai&s;ed in that County to go to Their Army, but detain'd till <HI>Cornwal</HI> could be &s;ettled; upon the News of S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI>'s advancing, the&s;e drew to <HI>Litton,</HI> a Village in <HI>De|von-&s;hire,</HI> but within three Miles of <HI>Launceston.</HI> S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> march'd within two Miles of the Town, where he refre&s;h'd his Men, intending, the next morning early, to fall on the Town: But S^r <HI>Richard Buller,</HI> and his confederates, not daring to abide the Storm, in great di&s;order quitted the Town that night, and drew into <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> and &s;o towards <HI>Plimouth;</HI> &s;o that in the morning S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> found the Gates of <HI>Launceston</HI> open, and enter'd without re&s;i&s;tance. As the &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to, <MILESTONE N="30"> and reverence of, the known practiced Laws had, by the Sheriffs Au|thority, rai&s;ed this Army within very few days, &s;o the extreme &s;uper|&s;tition to it, a&s;&s;oon di&s;&s;olv'd it. For when all the Per&s;ons of Honour, and Quality, who well knew the de&s;perate form'd de&s;igns of the other Party, earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd the pur&s;uing the di&s;heartned, and di&s;maied Re|bels into <HI>Devon,</HI> by which they &s;hould quickly encrea&s;e their Numbers, by joyning with the well affected in that large and populous County, who were yet aw'd into &s;ilence: <Q>It was powerfully objected, &startq;that the Sheriff, by who&s;e legal Authority only that Force was drawn together, might not lawfully march out of his own County, and that it was the <MILESTONE N="40"> principal Priviledge of the Train'd-bands, that they might not be com|pell'd&endq; to march farther, than the limits of their Sheriff.</Q></P>
<P>How greivous and inconvenient &s;oever this doctrine was di&s;cern'd to be, yet no Man dur&s;t pre&s;ume &s;o far upon the temper of that People, as to object Policy, or nece&s;&s;ity to the notions of Law. And therefore, concealing, as much as was po&s;&s;ible, the true rea&s;ons, they pretended their not following the Enemy proceeded from apprehen&s;ion of their &s;trength, by their joyning with S^r <HI>George Chudliegh,</HI> and of want of Am|munition (either of which were not unrea&s;onable) and &s;o march'd to <HI>Salt-a&s;h,</HI> a Town in <HI>Cornwal</HI> upon an Arm of the Sea; which only di|vided <MILESTONE N="50"> it from <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and <HI>Devon,</HI> where was a Garri&s;on of two hun|dred <HI>Scots;</HI> who, upon the approach of S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> as kindly quit <HI>Salt-a&s;h,</HI> as the others had <HI>Launce&s;ton</HI> before. So that being now entirely

Ma&s;ters of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> they fairly di&s;mi&s;s'd tho&s;e who could not be kept long together, and retired with their own handful of Hor&s;e and Dra|goons, till a new provocation from the Enemy &s;hould put fre&s;h Vigour into that County.</P>
<P>IN the mean time, con&s;idering the ca&s;ualty of tho&s;e Train'd-bands, and that &s;trength, which on a &s;uddain could be rai&s;ed by the <HI>po&s;&s;e Co|mitatus,</HI> which, though it made a Gallant &s;hew in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> they ea&s;ily &s;aw would be of no u&s;e towards the quenching the General Rebellion over <HI>England,</HI> they enter'd upon thoughts of rai&s;ing voluntary Regi|ments of Foot; which could be only done by the Gentlemen of that <MILESTONE N="10"> Country among their Neighbours, and Tenants, who depended on them. S^r <HI>Bevil Greenvil</HI> (the generally mo&s;t belov'd Man of that County) S^r <HI>Nicholas Slanning,</HI> the Gallant Governour of <HI>Pendennis</HI> Ca&s;tle, <HI>John Arundel,</HI> and <HI>John Trevannion,</HI> two young Men of Excellent hopes, and Heirs to great Fortunes in that Country (all four of them Members of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and &s;o better inform'd, and acquainted with the de&s;perate humours of the adver&s;e Party) undertook the rai&s;ing Re|giments of Voluntiers: many young Gentlemen, of the mo&s;t con&s;ider|able Families of the County, a&s;&s;i&s;ting them, as inferior Officers. So that, within a &s;horter time than could be expected, from one &s;ingle County, <MILESTONE N="20"> there was a Body of Foot, of near fifteen hundred, rai&s;ed, arm'd, and well di&s;ciplin'd for Action. But there was then an Accident, that might have di&s;compo&s;ed a People which had not been very well prepared to perform their duties.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Mohun</HI> (who had departed from <HI>York</HI> from the King with all profe&s;&s;ions of Zeal, and Activity in his Service) had, from the time of the fir&s;t motion in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> forborne to joyn him&s;elf to the King's Party; &s;taying at home at his own Hou&s;e, and imparting him&s;elf equal|ly to all Men of &s;everal con&s;titutions, as if he had not been yet &s;uffi|ciently inform'd which Party to adhere to. But after all the adver&s;e <MILESTONE N="30"> Party was driven out of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and the fame of the King's marching in the head of an Army, and having fought the Battle at <HI>Edge-hill</HI> (the effect whereof was variou&s;ly reported) without acquainting any Body with his Intention, he took a Journey towards <HI>London,</HI> at the time when the King march'd that way, and pre&s;ented him&s;elf to his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Brentford,</HI> as &s;ent from S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> and the re&s;t of tho&s;e Gentle|men engaged in <HI>Cornwal;</HI> though many Men believ'd that his purpo&s;e was, in truth, for <HI>London,</HI> if he had not then found the King's condi|tion better than it was generally believ'd. Upon his Lord&s;hips infor|mation of the State of tho&s;e We&s;tern parts, and upon a &s;uppo&s;ition that <MILESTONE N="40"> he &s;pake the &s;en&s;e, and de&s;ires of tho&s;e from whom he pretended to come, the King granted a Commi&s;&s;ion joyntly to his Lord&s;hip, S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> S^$ <HI>John Berkley,</HI> and Colonel <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> to govern tho&s;e Forces, in the ab&s;ence of the Lord Marquis of <HI>Hertford;</HI> with which he return'd into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and immediately rai&s;ed a Regiment of Foot; behaving him&s;elf as actively, and being every way as forward in the ad|vancing the great bu&s;ine&s;s, as any Man; &s;o that Men imputed his for|mer re&s;ervedne&s;s, only to his not being &s;atisfied in a condition of Com|mand.</P>
<P>ON the other &s;ide, they who were concern'd in that alteration, were <MILESTONE N="50"> not at all well contented. For before, the&s;e Gentlemen of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> upon who&s;e intere&s;t and activity the work depended, had, with great readine&s;s, complied with the other, both out of great value of their
<PB N="101" REF="1240">
Per&s;ons, with whom they had good familiarity, and friend&s;hip, and in re&s;pect of their Authority, and Commi&s;&s;ions, with which they came qualified in that County: for, as was remember'd before, S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> had a Commi&s;&s;ion from the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> to be Lieute|nant General of the Hor&s;e, S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> to be Commi&s;&s;ary General, and Colonel <HI>A&s;hburnham</HI> to be Major General of the Foot; &s;o that there was no di&s;pute of Commands. But now, the Lord <HI>Mohun</HI>'s com|ing into an equal Command with any, and &s;uperior to tho&s;e who thought Their reputation and intere&s;t to be &s;uperior to His (for he had not the good fortune to be very gracious in his own Country) and this by his <MILESTONE N="10"> own &s;ollicitation, and interpo&s;ition, gave them &s;ome indignation. How|ever their publick-heartedne&s;s, and joynt concernment in the good Cau&s;e, &s;o totally &s;uppre&s;s'd all Animo&s;ities, and indeed Indi&s;po&s;itions, that a greater concurrence could not be de&s;ired, in what&s;oever could contribute to the work in hand; &s;o that they not only pre&s;erv'd <HI>Corn|wal</HI> entire, but made bold incur&s;ions into <HI>Devon,</HI> even to the Walls of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and <HI>Exeter;</HI> though the Sea&s;on of the year, being the deep Winter, and the want of Ammunition, &s;oon forced them to retire into <HI>Cornwal.</HI></P>
<P>THE reputation of their being Ma&s;ters of that one County, and the <MILESTONE N="20"> apprehen&s;ion of what they might be &s;hortly able to do, made the Par|liament think it time to take more care for their &s;uppre&s;&s;ion. And therefore they &s;ent their whole Forces out of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> to joyn with tho&s;e of <HI>Devon,</HI> to make an entire conque&s;t of <HI>Cornwal.</HI> With the&s;e, <HI>Ruthen</HI> (a <HI>Scotch-</HI>man, the Governour of <HI>Plimouth)</HI> advanced into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> by a Bridge over the <HI>Tamar,</HI> &s;ix miles above <HI>Salt-a&s;h</HI> (where he had before endeavour'd to force his pa&s;&s;age by Water, but had been beaten off with lo&s;s) having ma&s;ter'd the Guard there; the Earl of <HI>Stamford</HI> following him, two or three days march behind, with a new &s;upply of Hor&s;e, and Foot; albeit tho&s;e the <HI>Scotch-</HI>man had with him, <MILESTONE N="30"> were much &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the Kings: which, upon this &s;uddain Inva&s;ion, were forced to retire with their whole &s;trength to <HI>Bodmin;</HI> whither, fore&s;eeing this &s;torm &s;ome few days before it came, they had again &s;ummon'd the <HI>po&s;se Comitatus,</HI> which appear'd in con&s;iderable Numbers.</P>
<P>THEY had &s;carce refre&s;h'd them&s;elves there, and put their Men in order; when <HI>Ruthen,</HI> with his Hor&s;e, Foot, and Cannon, was advanced to <HI>Liskard,</HI> within &s;even miles of <HI>Bodmin;</HI> from whence they moved towards the Enemy with all alacrity, knowing how nece&s;&s;ary it was for them to fight before the Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> who was at that time come <MILESTONE N="40"> to <HI>Launce&s;ton</HI> with a &s;trong party of Hor&s;e and Foot, &s;hould be able to joyn with the Rebels. And as this con&s;ideration was of importance to ha&s;ten the one, &s;o it prevail'd with the other Party too; for <HI>Ruthen,</HI> apprehending that his Victory, of which he made no que&s;tion, would be clouded by the pre&s;ence of the Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> who had the chief Command, re&s;olv'd to di&s;patch the bu&s;ine&s;s before He came. And &s;o S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> (to whom the other Commi&s;&s;ioners, who had a joynt Authority with him, willingly devolv'd the &s;ole Command for that day, le&s;t confu&s;ion of Orders might beget di&s;traction) was no &s;ooner known to be drawing towards him (to whom a pre&s;ent Battle was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, <MILESTONE N="50"> that it was re&s;olv'd, upon all di&s;advantages, to have fallen on the Enemy in the Town rather than not fight) but <HI>Ruthen</HI> likewi&s;e drew out his Forces, and choo&s;ing his ground upon the Ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Bradock-</HI>Down

near <HI>Liskard,</HI> &s;tood in Battalia to expect the Enemy; S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> having likewi&s;e put His Men in order, cau&s;ed publick Prayers to be &s;aid, in the head of every Squadron <Q>(which the Rebels ob&s;erving, told their fellows, &startq;&endq;they were at Ma&s;s, to &s;tir up their Courages in the cau&s;e of Religion)</Q> and having winged his Foot with his Hor&s;e and Dragoons, he advanced within Mu&s;quet-&s;hot of the Enemy, who &s;tood without any motion. Then perceiving that their Cannon were not yet come up from the Town, he cau&s;ed two &s;mall iron Minion Drakes (all the Ar|tillery they had) to be drawn, under the cover of little Parties of Hor&s;e, to a convenient di&s;tance from the Body of the Enemies; and after two <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;hots of tho&s;e Drakes (which being not di&s;cern'd, and doing &s;ome exe|cution &s;trook a greater terror into them) advanced with his Body upon them; and, with very ea&s;y contention, beat them off their ground; they having lined the Hedges behind them with their Re&s;erve, by which they thought &s;ecurely to make their retreat into the Town. But the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> &s;o briskly be&s;tirr'd them&s;elves, and pre&s;s'd them &s;o hard on eve|ry &s;ide, being indeed excellent at Hedge-work, and that kind of Fight, that they quickly wone That ground too, and put their whole Army in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> Ralph Hopton <HI>$eats the Parlia|ments Forces a$</HI> Bradock<HI>-Down vnder</HI> Ruthen.</NOTE> a rout, and had the full execution of them as far as they would pur&s;ue. But after that advantage, they were allways more &s;paring, than is u&s;ually <MILESTONE N="20"> known in Civil Wars, &s;hedding very little Blood after re&s;i&s;tance was given over, and having a very noble and Chri&s;tian &s;en&s;e of the lives of their Brethren: in&s;omuch as the Common Men, when they have been pre&s;s'd by &s;ome fiercer Officer, to follow the execution, <Q>have an&s;wer'd, &startq;they could not find in their hearts to hurt Men, who had nothing in&endq; their hands.</Q></P>
<P>IN this Battle, without the lo&s;s of an Officer of Name, and very few Common Men, they took twelve hundred and fifty Pri&s;oners, mo&s;t of their Colours, all their Cannon, being four Bra&s;s Guns (whereof two were twelve Pounders) and one iron Saker, all their Ammunition, and <MILESTONE N="30"> mo&s;t of their Armes. <HI>Ruthen</HI> him&s;elf, and tho&s;e who could keep pace with him, fled to <HI>Salt-a&s;h;</HI> which he thought to fortify, and by the Neighbourhood of <HI>Plimouth,</HI> and a&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Shipping, to defend; and thereby &s;till to have an influence upon a good part of <HI>Cornwal.</HI> The Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> receiving quick Adverti&s;ement of this Defeat, in great di&s;order retired to <HI>Tavi&s;tock,</HI> to pre&s;erve the utmo&s;t parts of <HI>Devon</HI> from incur&s;ions. Hereupon, after a &s;olemn Thank&s;giving to God for this great Victory (which was about the middle of <HI>January)</HI> and a little refre&s;hing their Men at <HI>Liskard,</HI> the King's Forces divided them&s;elves; S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> and Colonel <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> with S^r <HI>Bevil Greenvil,</HI> S^r <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Nicholas Slanning</HI>'s, and Colonel <HI>Trevannion</HI>'s Voluntary Regiments, and &s;uch a Party of Hor&s;e and Dragoons as could be &s;pared, advanced to <HI>Tavi&s;tock</HI> to vi&s;it the Earl of <HI>Stamford;</HI> the Lord <HI>Mohun,</HI> and S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> with the Lord <HI>Mohun</HI>'s, and Colonel <HI>Godolphin</HI>'s Voluntary Regiments, and &s;ome of the Train'd-bands, march'd towards <HI>Salt-a&s;h,</HI> to di&s;lodge <HI>Ruthen;</HI> who within three days (for there was no more be|tween his defeat at <HI>Bradock-</HI>Down, and his vi&s;itation at <HI>Salt-a&s;h)</HI> had ca&s;t up &s;uch works, and planted &s;uch &s;tore of Cannon upon the narrow Avenues, that he thought him&s;elf able, with the help of a goodly Ship of four hundred Tuns, in which were &s;ixteen pieces of Cannon, which he had brought up the River to the very &s;ide of the Town, to defend that place again&s;t any &s;trength was like to be brought again&s;t him.

<P>IN tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary and brisk expeditions in falling upon <HI>Chagford</HI> (a little Town in the South of <HI>Devon)</HI> before day, the King lo&s;t <HI>Sidney</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Sidney Godolphin <HI>&s;lain</HI></NOTE> <HI>Godolphin,</HI> a young Gentleman of incomparable parts; who, being of a con&s;titution and education more delicate, and unacquainted with con|tentions, upon his ob&s;ervation of the wickedne&s;s of tho&s;e Men in the Hou&s;e of Commons, of which he was a Member, out of the pure in|dignation of his Soul again&s;t them, and con&s;cience to his Country, had, with the fir&s;t, engaged him&s;elf with that Party in the We&s;t: and though <MILESTONE N="30"> he thought not fit to take Command in a Profe&s;&s;ion he had not willing|ly cho&s;en, yet as his advice was of great Authority with all the Com|manders, being allways one in the Council of War, and who&s;e notable abilities they had &s;till u&s;e of in their Civil Tran&s;actions, &s;o he expo&s;ed his Per&s;on to all Action, Travel, and Hazard; and by too forward en|gaging him&s;elf in this la&s;t, receiv'd a mortal &s;hot by a Mu&s;quet, a little above the knee, of which he died in the in&s;tant; leaving the misfortune of his death upon a place, which could never otherwi&s;e have had a men|tion to the world.</P>
<P>AFTER this, which happen'd about the end of <HI>January,</HI> in re&s;pect <MILESTONE N="40"> of the &s;ea&s;on of the year, and the want of Ammunition, finding that they could make no impre&s;&s;ion upon the &s;trong-holds of the Enemy, they retired, with their whole Forces, to <HI>Tavistock;</HI> where they re|fre&s;hed, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's</HI> Corni&s;h <HI>Forces come to</HI> Tavi&s;tock.</NOTE> and re&s;ted them&s;elves many days, being willing to ea&s;e their fa&s;t Friends of <HI>Cornwal</HI> as much as was po&s;&s;ible from the trouble, and charge of their little Army.

<P>THE taking this Prote&s;tation with that &s;olemnity, and the ble&s;&s;ed Sacrament thereupon, made even tho&s;e who before expected little fruit from the Treaty, believe, that Men, being &s;o engaged, would not be liable to tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions, and Affections, which u&s;ually tran&s;ported that Party; and &s;o to hope that &s;ome Good might proceed from it: and therefore the King's Party were ea&s;ily induced to retire with their Forces <MILESTONE N="10"> into <HI>Cornwal;</HI> and thereupon, a Truce, and Ce&s;&s;ation, was agreed upon, <NOTE PLACE="marg">A Truce, and Ce&s;&s;ation thereupon.</NOTE> that a Treaty might proceed without Interruption. In which Treaty, the &s;ame continuing beyond the expiration of the pre&s;ent year 1642, We &s;hall for the pre&s;ent leave them; that We may take a &s;hort &s;urvey of the Northern Parts, and remember by what degrees They came to feel the Calamities, and to bear Their Burthen in the Civil War.</P>
<P>WHEN the King left <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> he appointed S^r <HI>Thomas Glemham,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">An account of the Northern Parts di&s;po&s;i|tion, at that time.</NOTE> at the de&s;ire of the Gentlemen of that County, as was before remem|ber'd, to &s;tay in <HI>York,</HI> to order and command tho&s;e Forces, which they &s;hould find nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e, to defend them&s;elves from the excur&s;ions <MILESTONE N="20"> of <HI>Hull,</HI> whence young <HI>Hotham</HI> infe&s;ted the Country more than his Father; who was willing enough to &s;it &s;till in his Garri&s;on, where he believ'd he could make advantage upon the &s;ucce&s;s of either Party: and they who were mo&s;t inclined to the Parliament (whereof the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and his Son were the chief) from whom the King was &s;o far from expecting any notable mi&s;chief, that he left them all at their own Hou&s;es, when he went from thence; and might, if he had thought it requi&s;ite, have carried them away Pri&s;oners with him) were rather de|&s;irous to look on, than engage them&s;elves in the War; pre&s;uming that one Battle would determine all di&s;putes, and the Party which prevail'd <MILESTONE N="30"> in that, would find a general &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion throughout the Kingdom. And truly, I believe, there was &s;carce one Conclu&s;ion, that hath contributed more to the continuance and length of the War, than that generally receiv'd opinion in the beginning, that it would be quickly at an end. Hereupon, there being but one vi&s;ible difference like to beget di&s;tractions in the Country, which was about the Militia, the King appointing it to be govern'd, and di&s;po&s;ed by the Commi&s;&s;ion of Array, and the Par|liament by Their Ordinance; for the compo&s;ing whereof, the Gentle|men of the &s;everal opinions, propo&s;ed, between them&s;elves, <Q>&startq;that neither the One, nor the Other &s;hould be medled with; but that&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> all &s;hould be contented to &s;it &s;till,</Q> without engagement to either Par|ty: this &s;eem'd very rea&s;onable to the Parliament Party there, who were rather carried away with an implicite reverence to the very name of a Parliament (the fatal di&s;ea&s;e of the whole Kingdom at that time) than really tran&s;ported with the pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;ign of the furious part of it; and who plainly di&s;cern'd, that, by much the greate&s;t part of the Per&s;ons of Honour, Quality, and Intere&s;t in the County, would cordially oppo&s;e their Proceedings: For, be&s;ides the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> there were in truth few of good Reputation, and Fortune, who run that way. On the other hand, the King's Party thought Their work done by it; for <MILESTONE N="50"> They having already &s;ent two good Regiments of Foot, the one under Colonel <HI>John Bella&s;is,</HI> younger Son to the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Falconbridge,</HI> and the other under S^r <HI>William Pennyman;</HI> and two Regiments of
<PB N="106" REF="1290">
Dragoons, the one under Colonel <HI>Duncomb,</HI> the other, Colonel <HI>Gowre;</HI> be&s;ides three or four good Troops of Hor&s;e; and the King being at that di&s;tance, that they could not &s;end Him farther &s;upply; they thought they had nothing to do, but to keep the Country in &s;uch a Peace, that it might do the King no harm by &s;ending Men to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> or adhering to the Garri&s;on of <HI>Hull;</HI> and concluding, as the other did, that the deci&s;ion between the King and Parliament would be at the fir&s;t En|counter. Upon the&s;e deliberations, Articles were &s;olemnly drawn up, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Articles of Neutrality a|greed in</HI> York|&s;hire <HI>between both parties</HI></NOTE> con&s;ented to and &s;ub&s;cribed by the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and <HI>Harry Bella&s;is,</HI> the Heir Apparent of the Lord <HI>Falconbridge,</HI> who were the two Knights <MILESTONE N="10"> who &s;erv'd in Parliament for <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> nearly allyed together, and of great kindne&s;s till their &s;everal opinions, and affections had divided them in this Quarrel: the former adhering to the Parliament, the latter, with great Courage and Sobriety, to the King.</P>
<P>WITH them, the Principal Per&s;ons of either Party &s;ub&s;cribed the Articles, and gave their mutual Faiths to each other, that they would ob&s;erve them; being indeed no other than an Engagement of Neutra|lity, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t neither Party. Of all the Gentry of <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> there were only two Di&s;&s;enters on the Parliament &s;ide, young <HI>Hotham,</HI> and S^r <HI>Edward Rhodes;</HI> who, though of the better Quality, was not &s;o <MILESTONE N="20"> much known, or con&s;ider'd, as the other. But they quickly found Se|conds enough; for the Parliament no &s;ooner was inform'd of this tran&s;|action, than they expre&s;s'd their dete&s;tation of it, and gently in words (though &s;cornfully in matter) <Q>reprehending the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and his Party, &startq;&endq;for being cou&s;en'd, and over-reach'd by the other:</Q> <Q>They de|clared, &startq;that none of the Parties to that Agreement had any Authority to bind that Country to any &s;uch Neutrality, as was mention'd in that Agreement; it being a peculiar and proper Power, and Priviledge of Parliament, where the whole Body of the Kingdom is repre&s;ented, to bind all, or any part thereof: That it was very prejudicial and dan|gerous to the whole Kingdom, that one County &s;hould withdraw them&s;elves from the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the re&s;t, to which they were bound by Law, and by &s;everal Orders and Declarations of Parliament: That it was very derogatory to the Power and Authority of Parliament, that any private Men &s;hould take upon them to &s;u&s;pend the execution of the Ordinance of the Militia, declared by both Hou&s;es to be ac|cording to Law, and very nece&s;&s;ary, at that time, for the pre&s;erva|tion of the Peace and Safety of the Kingdom. And therefore, they &s;aid, they thought them&s;elves bound in Con&s;cience, to hinder all farther&endq; proceedings upon that Agreement;</Q> <Q>and order'd, &startq;that no &s;uch Neu|trality <NOTE PLACE="marg">But di&s;$$$$d by the Par|liament, upon which they en|ter'd into Acts of Ho$$ility there.</NOTE> &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd in that County. For if they &s;hould &s;uffer particular Counties to divide them&s;elves from the re&s;t of the King|dom,&endq; it would be a means of bringing all to ruin, and de&s;truction.</Q> <Q>And therefore they farther declared, that &startq;neither the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> nor the Gentlemen of <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> who were Parties to tho&s;e Articles, nor any other Inhabitants of that County, were bound by any &s;uch Agree|ment; but required them to pur&s;ue their former Re&s;olutions, of Maintaining and A&s;&s;i&s;ting the Parliament, in Defence of the Common Cau&s;e, according to the General Prote&s;tation wherein they were bound with the re&s;t of the Kingdom, and again&s;t the Particular Prote&s;tation by them&s;elves lately made; and according to &s;uch Orders and Com|mi&s;&s;ions as they &s;hould receive from both Hou&s;es of Parliament, from the Committee of the Lords and Commons appointed for the &s;afety&endq; 
<PB N="107" REF="1300">
of the Kingdom, or from the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Lord General.</Q> And le&s;t this their Declaration &s;hould not be of power enough to di&s;&s;olve this Agreement, they publi&s;h'd their Re&s;olution, and directed that <Q>&startq;M^r <HI>Hotham,</HI> and S^r <HI>Edward Rhodes,</HI> &s;hould proceed upon their former In&s;tructions; and that they &s;hould have power to &s;ei&s;e, and appre|hend all Delinquents that were &s;o voted by the Parliament, and all &s;uch others, as Delinquents, as had, or did &s;hew them&s;elves oppo&s;ite and&endq; di&s;obedient to the Orders and Proceedings of Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>UPON this Declaration, and Vote, not only young <HI>Hotham</HI> fell to the practice of Acts of Ho&s;tility, with all Licence, out of the Garri&s;on <MILESTONE N="10"> at <HI>Hull,</HI> but the Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> him&s;elf, and all the Gentlemen of that Party, who had, with that Prote&s;tation, &s;ign'd the Articles, in&s;tead of re&s;enting the reproach to them&s;elves, tamely &s;ubmitted to tho&s;e un|rea&s;onable conclu&s;ions: and, contrary to their &s;olemn Promi&s;e and En|gagement, prepared them&s;elves to bear a part in the War, and made all ha&s;t to levy Men.</P>
<P>UPON &s;o great a di&s;advantage were the King's Party in all places; who were &s;o preci&s;e in promi&s;es, and their per&s;onal undertakings, that they believ'd they could not &s;erve the King, and his Cau&s;e, if Their reputation and integrity were once blemi&s;h'd, though &s;ome particular <MILESTONE N="20"> Contract proved to his di&s;advantage: whil&s;t the Others expo&s;ed their Honours for any pre&s;ent temporary conveniencies, and thought them|&s;elves Ab&s;olv'd by any new Re&s;olution of the Hou&s;es, to who&s;e Cu&s;tody their Honour, and Ingenuity was committed. The pre&s;ent di&s;advantage of this Rupture was greater to the King's Party there, than to the other. For (be&s;ides that many who concurr'd with them very frankly and &s;ollicitou&s;ly in the Neutrality, &s;eparated them&s;elves from them now there was a nece&s;&s;ity of Action) they had neither Money to rai&s;e Men, nor Armes to arme them; &s;o that the &s;trength con&s;i&s;ted in the Gentle|men them&s;elves, and their Retinue; who, by the good Affections of the <MILESTONE N="30"> Inhabitants of <HI>York,</HI> were &s;trong enough to &s;ecure one another within the Walls of that City. Then the Earl of <HI>Cumberland,</HI> in whom the chief power of Command was to rai&s;e Men and Money in a ca&s;e of Ne|ce&s;&s;ity, though he was a Per&s;on of entire devotion to the King, was in his nature Unactive, and utterly unexperienced in Affairs and Exigents of that Nature.</P>
<P>ON the other hand, the oppo&s;ite Party was &s;trengthned and enabled by the &s;trong Garri&s;on of <HI>Hull,</HI> whence young <HI>Hotham,</HI> on all occa&s;ions, was ready to &s;econd them with his Troop of Hor&s;e, and to take up any well affected Per&s;on who was &s;u&s;pected to be Loyal; which drove all <MILESTONE N="40"> re&s;olv'd Men from their Hou&s;es into <HI>York,</HI> where they only could be &s;afe. The other could have what Men more they de&s;ired from <HI>London,</HI> and both ready Money from thence to <HI>Hull,</HI> and Ordinances to rai&s;e what they would in the County to pay them. <HI>Leeds, Hallifax,</HI> and <HI>Bradford,</HI> three very populous, and rich Towns (which depending whole|ly upon Clothiers too much maligned the Gentry) were wholely at their di&s;po&s;ition. Their Neighbours in <HI>Lincoln-shire</HI> were in a Body to &s;econd them, and S^r <HI>John Gell</HI> was on the &s;ame behalf po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of <HI>Derby,</HI> and all that County, there being none that had the hardine&s;s Yet, to de|clare there for the King. So that, if S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI>'s warine&s;s had not <MILESTONE N="50"> kept him from being active, and his pride, and contempt of the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> upon whom the Country chiefly depended, hinder'd him from &s;econding, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting his Lord&s;hip; or if any Man had had the entire
<PB N="108" REF="1310">
Command of tho&s;e parts, and Forces, to have united them, the Parlia|ment had, with very little re&s;i&s;tance, been ab&s;olute Ma&s;ters of all <HI>York|shire;</HI> and, as ea&s;ily, of the City it &s;elf. But their want of Union in Particulars, though they agreed too well in the Main, gave the King's Party time to breath, and to look about for their pre&s;ervation. There|upon, they &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> for A&s;&s;i&s;tance; <Q>offering, &startq;if he would march into <HI>York-shire,</HI> they would joyn with him, and be&endq; entirely Commanded by him;</Q> the Earl of <HI>Cumberland</HI> willingly offer|ing to wave any Title to Command.</P>
<P>IT was before remember'd, that, when the King left <HI>York,</HI> he had &s;ent <MILESTONE N="10"> the Earl of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> as a Per&s;on of great Honour, and Intere&s;t in tho&s;e parts, to be Governour of <HI>New-Castle;</HI> and &s;o to &s;ecure that Port, that the Parliament might neither &s;ei&s;e it, nor the <HI>Scots</HI> be bribed by it to come to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of their Brethren. Which Commi&s;&s;ion from the King, his Lord&s;hip no &s;ooner executed, without the lea&s;t ho&s;tility (for that Town receiv'd him with all po&s;&s;ible acknowledgements of the King's goodne&s;s in &s;ending him) but he was impeach'd by the Hou&s;e of Commons of High Trea&s;on. From his going thither (which was in <HI>Au|gu&s;t)</HI> till toward the end of <HI>November,</HI> the Earl &s;pent his time in di&s;po&s;ing the People of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham,</HI> to the <MILESTONE N="20"> King's Service, and to a right under&s;tanding of the matters in difference; in the fortifying <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> and the River; whereby that Harbour might only be in the King's Obedience; in rai&s;ing a Garri&s;on for that place, and providing Armes for a farther advance of the King's Service. Then he provided for the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of his Friends in <HI>York-shire,</HI> who&s;e condition grew every day more de&s;perate. For the Parliament, finding the inconveniencies of having no Commander in Chief in tho&s;e parts, had cau&s;ed their Generali&s;&s;imo, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> to &s;end a Commi&s;|&s;ion to the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> <Q>&startq;to Command all the Forces of <HI>York-shire,&endq;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Fairfax <HI>made General of</HI> York-&s;hire <HI>for the Par|liament.</HI></NOTE> and the adjacent Counties, in Chief;</Q> by which, in le&s;s time than could <MILESTONE N="30"> be rea&s;onably imagined, he was able to draw together an Army of five or &s;ix thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot; &s;o that <HI>York</HI> mu&s;t pre&s;ently have been &s;wallow'd up.</P>

The Earl being now ma&s;ter of the North as far as <HI>York,</HI> thought rather of forming an Ar|my, and providing money to pay it, than of making any farther pro|gre&s;s in the Winter; and therefore &s;uffer'd the Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> to enjoy the Southern part of that large rich County, till the &s;pring, and the improvement of his condition, &s;hould enable him to advance: Yet few days pa&s;s'd without blows, in which the Parliament Forces had u&s;ually <MILESTONE N="50"> the wor&s;t.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after the Earl's coming to <HI>York,</HI> General <HI>King</HI> repaired to him, whom he made Lieutenant General of his Army; who, not|with&s;tanding

the unavoidable prejudice, in that Conjuncture, of his be|ing a <HI>Scotch-</HI>man, order'd the Foot with great wi&s;dom and dexterity: the charge of the Hor&s;e being at the &s;ame time committed to General <HI>Goring;</HI> who, by the Queens favour, notwith&s;tanding all former failings, was recommended to that Province, and quickly applied him&s;elf to Action: &s;o that, though the Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> kept <HI>Selby,</HI> and <HI>Cawood,</HI> both within a &s;mall di&s;tance from <HI>York,</HI> the Earl was ab&s;olute Ma&s;ter of the Field.

<P>HER Maje&s;ty had, from her fir&s;t going into <HI>Holland,</HI> dexterou&s;ly endeavour'd to advance the King's Intere&s;t, and &s;ent very great quan|tities of Armes and Ammunition to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> (though, by the vigilance of the Parliament Agents in tho&s;e parts, and the power of their Ships, too much of it was intercepted) with &s;ome con&s;iderable Sums of Mo|ney, and good &s;tore of Officers; who, by the connivance of the Prince of <HI>Orange,</HI> came over to &s;erve their own King.

<P>ABOUT the middle of <HI>February,</HI> the Queen took Shipping from <HI>Holland,</HI> in a States Man of War, a&s;&s;ign'd by the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> with others for her Convoy, and arrived &s;afely in <HI>Burlington-</HI>Bay, upon the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen ar|rives at</HI> Bur|lington <HI>from</HI> Holland.</NOTE> Coa&s;t of <HI>York-shire;</HI> where &s;he had the patience to &s;tay on Shipboard <MILESTONE N="30"> at Anchor, the &s;pace of two days, till the Earl had notice, <Q>&startq;to draw &s;uch a part of his Forces that way, as might &s;ecure her Landing, and&endq; wait on her to <HI>York;</HI></Q> which he no &s;ooner did (and he did it with all imaginable expedition) but her Maje&s;ty came on Shore; and, for the pre|&s;ent, was plea&s;ed to refre&s;h her &s;elf in a convenient Hou&s;e upon the very Key, where all accommodations were made for her reception; there being many things of Moment to be un&s;hipp'd before &s;he could rea&s;on|ably enter upon her Journey towards <HI>York.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;econd day after the Queen's Landing, <HI>Batten,</HI> Vice-Admiral to the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> (who had waited to intercept her pa&s;&s;age) with <MILESTONE N="40"> $our of the King's Ships, arrived in <HI>Burlington</HI> Road; and, finding that her Maje&s;ty was Landed, and that &s;he lodged upon the Key, bringing his Ships to the neare&s;t di&s;tance, being very early in the morning, di&s;|charged above a hundred Cannon (whereof many were laden with Cro&s;s|bar-&s;hot) for the &s;pace of two hours upon the Hou&s;e where her Maje&s;ty was lodged; whereupon &s;he was forced out of her Bed, &s;ome of the &s;hot making way through her own Chamber; and to &s;helter her &s;elf under a Bank in the open Fields; which Barbarous and Trea&s;onable Act, was &s;o much the more odious, in that the Parliament never &s;o far took no|tice of it, as to di&s;avow it.

<P>THE City of <HI>Chester</HI> was firm to the King, by the virtue of the In|habitants, and Intere&s;t of the Bi&s;hop, and Cathedral Men; but e&s;pe|cially by the reputation, and dexterity of M^r <HI>O. Bridgman,</HI> Son to the Bi&s;hop, and a Lawyer of very good e&s;timation; who not only inform'd them of their duty, and encouraged them in it, but upon his Credit <MILESTONE N="10"> and E&s;tate, both which were very good, &s;upplied them with what&s;o|ever was nece&s;&s;ary for their defence; &s;o that they were not put to be Hone&s;t and Expen&s;ive together. But as they had no Garri&s;on of Soldiers, &s;o they had no Officer of skill and experience to manage, and direct that Courage which, at lea&s;t, was willing to defend their own Walls; which they were now like to be put to. Therefore the King &s;ent thither S^r <HI>Nicholas Byron,</HI> a Soldier of very good Command, <Q>with a Commi&s;&s;ion to be &startq;Colonel-General of <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and <HI>Shropshire;</HI> and to be Gover|nour&endq; of <HI>Chester;</HI></Q> who being a Per&s;on of great affability, and dexterity, as well as Martial knowledge, gave great life to the de&s;igns of the well-affected <MILESTONE N="20"> there; and, with the encouragement of &s;ome Gentlemen of North <HI>Wales,</HI> in a &s;hort time rai&s;ed &s;uch a power of Hor&s;e and Foot, as made often Skirmi&s;hes with the Enemy; &s;ometimes with notable ad|vantage, never with any &s;ignal lo&s;s. S^r <HI>William Bruerton</HI> fortified <HI>Nant|witch,</HI> as the King's Party did <HI>Chester;</HI> from which Garri&s;ons, contain|ing both their Forces, they contended which &s;hould mo&s;t prevail upon, that is mo&s;t &s;ubdue, the Affections of the County, to declare for, and joyn with them. But the fair expectation of <HI>Cheshire</HI> was clouded by the &s;torms that aro&s;e in <HI>Lancashire,</HI> where Men of no Name, and con|temn'd Intere&s;t, by the meer credit of the Parliament, and frenzy of <MILESTONE N="30"> the People, on a &s;uddain &s;natch'd that large and populous County, from their Devotion to the Earl of <HI>Derby.</HI></P>
<P>THE Town of <HI>Manchester</HI> had, from the beginning (out of that Fa|ctious humour which po&s;&s;e&s;s'd mo&s;t Corporations, and the pride of their Wealth) oppo&s;ed the King, and declared magi&s;terially for the Parlia|ment. But as a great part of the County con&s;i&s;ted of Papi&s;ts, of who&s;e In&s;urrections they had made &s;uch u&s;e in the beginning of the Parlia|ment, when they had a mind to Alarm the People with dangers; &s;o it was confidently believ'd, that there was not one Man often throughout that County, who meant not to be dutiful, and loyal to the King: yet <MILESTONE N="$0"> the re&s;tle&s;s &s;pirit of the &s;editious Party was &s;o &s;edulous, and indu&s;trious, and every one of the Party &s;o ready to be engaged, and punctually to obey; and, on the other hand, the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> &s;o Unactive, and &s;o uncomplying with tho&s;e who were fuller of alacrity, and would have proceeded more vigorou&s;ly again&s;t the Enemy; or, through want of experience &s;o irre&s;olute, that in&s;tead of countenancing the King's Party in <HI>Cheshire,</HI> which was expected from him, the Earl, in&s;en&s;ibly, found <HI>Lancashire</HI> to be allmo&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;s'd again&s;t him: the Rebels, every day, gaining, and fortifying all the &s;trong Towns, and &s;urpri&s;ing his Troops, without any con&s;iderable Encounter. And yet, &s;o hard was the King's <MILESTONE N="$0"> condition, that though he knew tho&s;e great misfortunes proceeded from want of Conduct, and of a vigorous and expert Commander, he thought it not &s;afe to make any alteration, le&s;t that Earl might be provoked,
<PB N="112" REF="1360">
out of di&s;dain to have any Superior in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> to manife&s;t how much he could do Again&s;t him, though it appear'd he could do little For him. Yet it was ea&s;ily di&s;cern'd, that his Ancient power there depended more upon the Fear, than Love of the People; there being very many, now in this time of Liberty, engaging them&s;elves again&s;t the King, that they might not be &s;ubject to that Lords Commands.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the King committing <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> &s;till to his Lord&s;hips care (who&s;e Fidelity, without doubt, was blamele&s;s, whatever his Skill was) he &s;ent the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> <Q>with a Commi&s;&s;ion of &startq;&endq; Lieutenant General of <HI>Shropshire,</HI></Q> <HI>Cheshire,</HI> and North <HI>Wales;</HI> who, <MILESTONE N="10"> being a Per&s;on of great Fortune, and Honour, quickly engaged tho&s;e parts in a chearful A&s;&s;ociation; and rai&s;ed a Body of Hor&s;e and Foot, that gave S^r <HI>William Bruerton</HI> &s;o much trouble at <HI>Nantwitch,</HI> that the Garri&s;on at <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> had breath to enlarge it's Quarters, and to provide for it's own &s;ecurity; though the Enemy omitted no opportunity of infe&s;ting them, and gave them as much trouble as was po&s;&s;ible. It can|not be denied but S^r <HI>William Bruerton,</HI> and the other Gentlemen of that Party, albeit their Educations, and cour&s;e of life, had been very diffe|rent from their pre&s;ent Engagements, and for the mo&s;t part were very unpromi&s;ing in matters of War, and therefore were too much contemn'd <MILESTONE N="20"> Enemies, executed their Commands with notable Sobriety, and inde|fatigable Indu&s;try (virtues not &s;o well practiced in the King's Quarters) in&s;omuch as the be&s;t Soldiers who encounter'd with them, had no cau&s;e to de&s;pi&s;e them. It is true, they had no other &s;treights, and difficulties to &s;truggle with, than what proceeded from their Enemy; being allways &s;upplied with Money to pay their Soldiers, and with Armes to Arme them; whereby it was in their power not to grieve and oppre&s;s the Peo|ple. And thereby (be&s;ides the &s;pirit of Faction that much govern'd) the Common People were more devoted to them, and gave them all Intelligence of what might concern them; whereas they who were in|tru&s;ted <MILESTONE N="30"> to govern the King's Affairs, had intolerable difficulties to pa&s;s through; being to rai&s;e Men without Money, to Arme them without Weapons (that is they had no Magazine to &s;upply them) and to keep them together without Pay; &s;o that the Country was both to Feed, and Cloath the Soldiers; which quickly inclined them to remember only the Burthen, and forget the Quarrel.</P>
<P>THE difference in the temper of the Common People of both &s;ides was &s;o great, that they who inclined to the Parliament, left nothing unperform'd that might advance the Cau&s;e; and were incredibly vigi|lant and indu&s;trious to cro&s;s, and hinder what&s;oever might promote the <MILESTONE N="40"> King's: whereas they who Wi&s;h'd well to Him, thought they had per|form'd their duty in doing So, and that they had done enough For him, in that they had done nothing Again&s;t him.</P>
<P>THOUGH, by this &s;ending the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> tho&s;e Counties of <HI>Shrop|shire,</HI> and <HI>Cheshire,</HI> with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of North <HI>Wales,</HI> kept tho&s;e parts &s;o near their Obedience, that their Di&s;obedience was not yet per|nicious to the King, in &s;ending A&s;&s;i&s;tance to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, or to the Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI> again&s;t the Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> yet tho&s;e Counties which lay in the line between <HI>Oxford</HI> and <HI>York,</HI> were, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The condition, at that time, of the Coun|ties between</HI> Oxford, <HI>and</HI> York.</NOTE> upon the matter, entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Enemy. The Garri&s;on of <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Northampton</HI> kept that whole County in obedience to the Parliament, &s;ave, that from <HI>Banbury</HI> the adjacent Parts were forced to bring &s;ome contribution thither. In <HI>Warwick-shire</HI> the King had no footing; the

Ca&s;tle of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the City of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and his own Ca&s;tle of <HI>Killing|worth,</HI> being fortified again&s;t him. The Lord <HI>Grey,</HI> Son to the Earl of <HI>Stamford,</HI> had the Command of <HI>Leice&s;ter-&s;hire;</HI> and had put a Garri&s;on into <HI>Leice&s;ter. Derby-&s;hire,</HI> without any vi&s;ible Party in it for the King, was under the power of S^r <HI>John Gell,</HI> who had fortified <HI>Derby.</HI> And all the&s;e Counties, with <HI>Stafford-&s;hire,</HI> were united in an A&s;&s;ociation again&s;t the King under the Command of the Lord <HI>Brook;</HI> who was, by the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> made General of that A&s;&s;ociation; a Man cordially Di&s;affected to the Government of the Church, and upon whom that Party had a great dependence. This A&s;&s;ociation receiv'd no other Interruption from, <MILESTONE N="10"> or for the King, than what Colonel <HI>Ha&s;tings</HI> gave; who, being a youn|ger Son to the Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> had appear'd eminently for the King from the beginning; having rai&s;ed a good Troop of Hor&s;e with the fir&s;t, and, in the head thereof, charged at <HI>Edge-hill.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER the King was &s;ettled at <HI>Oxford,</HI> Colonel <HI>Ha&s;tings,</HI> with his own Troop of Hor&s;e only, and &s;ome Officers which he ea&s;ily gather'd together, <Q>went with a Commi&s;&s;ion into <HI>Leice&s;ter-&s;hire</HI> &startq;of Colonel Ge|neral&endq; of that County,</Q> and fixed him&s;elf at <HI>A&s;hby de la Zouch,</HI> the Hou&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> his Father, who was then living; which he pre&s;ently fortified; and, in a very &s;hort time, by his Intere&s;t there, <MILESTONE N="20"> rai&s;ed &s;o good a Party of Hor&s;e and Foot, that he maintain'd many Skir|mi&s;hes with the Lord <HI>Grey:</HI> the King's Service being the more advanced there, by the notable Animo&s;ities between the two Families of <HI>Hun|tington</HI> and <HI>Stamford;</HI> between whom the County was divided pa&s;|&s;ionately enough, without any other Quarrel. And now the Sons fought the Publick Quarrel, with their Private Spirit and Indignation. But the King had the advantage in His Champion, the Lord <HI>Grey</HI> being a young Man of no eminent parts, and only backed with the credit and Authority of the Parliament: whereas Colonel <HI>Hastings,</HI> though a younger Brother, by his per&s;onal reputation, had &s;upported his Family; <MILESTONE N="30"> and, by the intere&s;t of It, and the affection that People bore to him, brought, no doubt, an addition of power to the very Cau&s;e. In&s;omuch as he not only defended him&s;elf again&s;t the Forces of the Parliament in <HI>Leicester-shire,</HI> but di&s;quieted S^r <HI>John Gell</HI> in <HI>Derby-shire,</HI> and fixed &s;ome convenient Garri&s;ons in <HI>Stafford-shire.</HI></P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time, &s;ome Gentlemen of that County, rather well affected than experienced, before they were well enough provided to go through their work, &s;elfed on the Clo&s;e in <HI>Lichfield</HI> for the King; a place naturally &s;trong, and defended with a Mote, and a very high and thick Wall; which in the Infancy of the War was thought a good For|tification. <MILESTONE N="40"> To &s;uppre&s;s this growing Force, within the limits of his A&s;&s;ociation, the Lord <HI>Brook</HI> advanced with a form'd Body of Hor&s;e, Foot, and Cannon; part drawn from the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army, and the re&s;t out of the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Coventry,</HI> and <HI>Warwick;</HI> and, without any re&s;i&s;tance, enter'd the City of <HI>Lichfield;</HI> which, being unfortified, was open to all Comers.

And it was re|ported, that in his Prayer, that very morning (for he u&s;ed to pray publickly though his Chaplain were in the pre&s;ence) he wi&s;h'd, <Q>&startq;that if the Cau&s;e he were in, were not right and ju&s;t, he might be pre&s;ent|ly&endq; cut off.</Q> They who were acquainted with him, believ'd him to be <MILESTONE N="10"> well natured, and ju&s;t; and rather &s;educed, and corrupted in his under|&s;tanding, than perver&s;e and malicious. Whether his Pa&s;&s;ions or Con|&s;cience &s;wayed him, he was undoubtedly one of tho&s;e who could have been with mo&s;t difficulty reconciled to the Government of Church or State: And therefore his death was look'd upon as no ill Omen to Peace, and was exceedingly lamented by His Party; which had &s;carce a more ab&s;olute confidence in any Man than in Him. However it brought not that relief to the be&s;ieged in the Clo&s;e as was believ'd it would; for the &s;ame Forces, under S^r <HI>John Gell,</HI> proceeded &s;o vigorou&s;ly in the work, and they Within &s;o faintly, and unskilfully, that without any of that <MILESTONE N="20"> di&s;tre&s;s which Men thought it might bear, and which it did, within a &s;hort time after, bear again&s;t the King, the place was yeilded without other conditions than of Quarter; by which many Per&s;ons became Pri|&s;oners, of too good Quality to have their Names remember'd.</P>
<P>BY this prize, the &s;pirits of that Party were much exalted, and the King's Party in tho&s;e parts as much ca&s;t down. Yet &s;ome Gentlemen betook them&s;elves to the Town of <HI>Stafford,</HI> and having too much de|clared <NOTE PLACE="marg">Stafford <HI>Gar|ri&s;on'd by &s;ome Gentlemen for the King.</HI></NOTE> for the King, when they thought <HI>Lichfield</HI> would have been of &s;trength to &s;ecure them, to hope to live unhurt at their Hou&s;es, re&s;olv'd to defend that place; again&s;t which S^r <HI>John Gell</HI> drew his late fle&s;h'd <MILESTONE N="30"> Troops. But the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> (who intended the relief of <HI>Lich|field,</HI> if they had had any patience to expect it) with a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e, and Dragoons, from his Garri&s;on of <HI>Banbury,</HI> came &s;ea&s;onably to their Succour, and put him&s;elf into the Town; and, the &s;ame Night, beat up a Quarter of the Enemies, in which he kill'd and took above an hundred of their Hor&s;e. S^r <HI>John Gell</HI> retired &s;o far as to meet with S^r <HI>William Bruerton,</HI> who, from <HI>Nantwitch,</HI> was coming to joyn with him for the &s;ubduing of <HI>Stafford;</HI> and, having done that, re&s;olv'd to march in a Body for the clearing the other Counties. When they were joyn'd, being near three thou&s;and Foot, and Hor&s;e, with a good Train of Artillery, they moved back towards <HI>Stafford;</HI> imagining the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> would meet them without the Walls: and it &s;o fell out; for the Earl no &s;ooner heard that the Rebels were drawing towards the Town, but he drew out his Party to encounter them; imagining it could be only <HI>Gell,</HI> who&s;e Numbers he under&s;tood, and who&s;e Courage he much undervalued.</P>
<P>IT was on a <HI>Sunday,</HI> about the middle of <HI>March,</HI> when, in the after|noon, he march'd out of <HI>Stafford;</HI> his Party con&s;i&s;ting of Hor&s;e, and Dragoons, and &s;ome few Foot, the whole Number being under one thou&s;and, and found the Enemy, in very good Order, expecting them upon a place called <HI>Hopton-</HI>Heath, &s;ome two Miles from <HI>Stafford.</HI> Though the Number was more than double to the Earl's, yet the Heath &s;eeming very fair, the breadth of it being more than Mu&s;quet-&s;hot from
<PB N="115" REF="1410">
Enclo&s;ure on each &s;ide, and the number of his Hor&s;e being at lea&s;t equal to the other, he re&s;olv'd to charge them; and accordingly Did, with &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s, that he totally routed that part of their Hor&s;e; and, ral|lying again his Men, he charg'd the other part of their Hor&s;e, which &s;tood more in &s;helter of their Foot; and &s;o totally routed, and di&s;per&s;ed them, that the Enemy had &s;carce a Hor&s;e left upon the Field; and took likewi&s;e from them eight pieces of Cannon.</P>
<P>IN this &s;econd Charge, the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> being engaged on the execution, very near, or among their Foot, had his Hor&s;e killed under him. So that his own Hor&s;e (according to their unhappy practice) <MILESTONE N="10"> with too much fury pur&s;uing the Cha&s;e, he was left encompa&s;s'd by his Enemies. What His behaviour was afterwards, and Their Carriage to|wards Him, can be known only by the Te&s;timony of the Rebels; who confe&s;s'd, that after he was on his feet, he kill'd with his own hand the Colonel of Foot who made fir&s;t ha&s;t to him; and that after his head|piece was &s;tricken off with the But-end of a Mu&s;quet, they offer'd him quarter; which, they &s;ay, he refu&s;ed; an&s;wering, <Q>&startq;that he &s;corn'd to&endq; take quarter from &s;uch ba&s;e Rogues, and Rebels, as They were.</Q> Af|ter which, he was &s;lain by a blow with a Halbert on the hinder part of <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Ear$ $f $Span$ vanqui&s;h'd $Word$ Enemies Hor&s;e that oppo&s;ed him.</NOTE> his head, receiving, at the &s;ame time, another deep wound in his face. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>ALL this time the Enemies Foot &s;tood, which (after their Hor&s;e were di&s;per&s;ed) S^r <HI>Thomas Byron,</HI> who Commanded the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s Regiment, a Gentleman of great Courage, and of very good Conduct, charged with good execution. But the Night came on a pace, and the Field, which they thought &s;o fair, was found full of Coal-pits, and holes dangerous for their Hor&s;e; &s;o that they thought fit to forbear farther Action, till they might have the Morning's light; and &s;tood all that Night in the Field. When the Morning appear'd, there was no Enemy to be &s;een. For a&s;&s;oon as the Fight ended, and the Night drew on, that they were unperceiv'd, they had left the Field, in hope that their &s;cat|ter'd <MILESTONE N="30"> Hor&s;e would find them in quarters more remote from the danger. The Victorious Party was &s;o hara&s;&s;ed with duty, and tired with the fight, &s;o ca&s;t down with the lo&s;s of their General, and &s;o de&s;titute of Officers to Direct and Command, what was next to be done (For the Lord <HI>Compton,</HI> the Earls elde&s;t Son, had receiv'd a &s;hot in the Leg; S^r <HI>Thomas Byron</HI> a &s;hot in the Thigh, whereby they were not able to keep the field; and many other Officers hurt) that they retired to refre&s;h them&s;elves at <HI>Stafford,</HI> after they had taken the &s;poil of the field and buried their dead.</P>
<P>IN this Fight, which was &s;harp, and &s;hort, there were kill'd, and taken <MILESTONE N="40"> Pri&s;oners, of the Parliament Party, above two hundred, and more than that number wounded. For, the Hor&s;e charging among their Foot, more were hurt than kill'd. Eight pieces of their Cannon, and mo&s;t of their Ammunition was likewi&s;e taken. Of the Earls Party were &s;lain but five and twenty, whereof there were two Captains, &s;ome inferior Officers, and the re&s;t Common Men: but there were as many hurt, and tho&s;e of the chief Officers. They who had all the En&s;igns of Victory, but their General, thought them&s;elves undone; whil&s;t the other &s;ide, who had e&s;caped in the Night, and made a hard &s;hift to carry his dead Body with them, hardly believ'd they were lo&s;ers: <MILESTONE N="$0"></P>

THE truth is, a greater Victory had been an unequal recompence <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Character.</NOTE> for &s;uch a lo&s;s. He was a Per&s;on of great Courage, Honour, and Fide|lity, and not well known till his Evening; having, in the ea&s;e, and plen|ty, and luxury of that too happy time, indulged to him&s;elf, with that licence which was then thought nece&s;&s;ary to great fortunes: but from the beginning of the&s;e Di&s;tractions, as if he had been awaken'd out of a Lethargy, he never proceeded with a luke-warm temper. Before the Standard was &s;et up, he appear'd in <HI>Warwick-&s;hire</HI> again&s;t the Lord <HI>Brook,</HI> and as much upon his own Reputation as the Ju&s;tice of the Cau&s;e (which was not &s;o well then under&s;tood) di&s;countenanced, and drove <MILESTONE N="10"> him out of that County. Afterwards he took the Ordnance from <HI>Ban|bury-</HI>Ca&s;tle, and brought them to the King. A&s;&s;oon as an Army was to be rai&s;ed, he levied, with the fir&s;t, upon his own charge, a Troop of Hor&s;e, and a Regiment of Foot; and (not like &s;ome other Men, who warily di&s;tributed their Family to both &s;ides, one Son to &s;erve the King, whil&s;t his Father, or another Son, engaged as far for the Parliament) entirely dedicated all his Children to the Quarrel; having four Sons Officers under him, whereof three charged that day in the Field: And, from the time he &s;ubmitted him&s;elf to the profe&s;&s;ion of a Soldier, no Man more punctual upon Command, no Man more diligent and vigi|lant <MILESTONE N="20"> in duty. All di&s;tre&s;&s;es he bore like a Common Man, and all wants, and hardne&s;&s;es, as if he had never known plenty, or ea&s;e; mo&s;t prodigal of his Per&s;on to danger; and would often &s;ay, <Q>&startq;that if he out liv'd&endq; the&s;e Wars, he was certain never to have &s;o noble a death.</Q> So that it is not to be wonder'd, if, upon &s;uch a &s;troke, the Body that felt it, thought it had lo&s;t more than a Limb.</P>
<P>ASSOON as it was known where the Enemy re&s;ted after their retreat, the young Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> &s;ent a Trumpet to S^r <HI>John Gell,</HI> to de|&s;ire the Body of his Father, that he might give it &s;uch decent burial, as became him. <Q><HI>Gell</HI> and <HI>Bruerton,</HI> joyntly, by letter, demanded &startq;in ex|change <MILESTONE N="30"> for the dead Body, all their Ammunition, Pri&s;oners, and Can|non,&endq; they had lo&s;t at the Battle;</Q> which demands being &s;o unrea&s;onable, and again&s;t the Law of Armes, the Earl &s;ent again to them, to de&s;ire, <Q>&startq;that if they would not return the Corps, that his Chirurgeon might have leave to embalm it, whereby it might be pre&s;erv'd to receive tho&s;e rights, when they &s;hould be willing to gratify him, which, he&endq; pre&s;umed, upon more di&s;pa&s;&s;ion'd thoughts, they would be.</Q> Their An&s;wer to this was as unrea&s;onable as the other, <Q>&startq;That they would neither &s;end the Body, nor permit his Chirurgeons to come to em|balm&endq; it;</Q> pre&s;uming, it is probable, that the piety of the Son would <MILESTONE N="40"> have prevailed to have their unheard of propo&s;itions complied with.</P>
<P>AND &s;o We &s;hall, for the pre&s;ent, leave the&s;e parts, and vi&s;it the Prin|cipality <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The State of the Principa|lity of</HI> Wales <HI>at that time.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Wales;</HI> of which, hitherto very little hath been &s;aid; and from the Affection whereof, the King had, from the beginning, a very great benefit; it having &s;upplied him with three or four good Regiments of Foot, in which many of their Gentry were engaged, before the Bat|tle of <HI>Edge-hill.</HI></P>
<P>IT hath been before remember'd, that the Marquis of <HI>Hertford</HI> drew with him out of <HI>Wales,</HI> and brought to <HI>Oxford,</HI> about <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> near two thou&s;and Men; leaving <HI>Wales</HI> guarded only with the Courage and <MILESTONE N="40"> Fidelity of the Gentry, and Inhabitants.

of Men and Provi&s;ions from thence; the King allways put it under the Government of tho&s;e to whom he committed tho&s;e parts. South <HI>Wales,</HI> which is much the larger, and richer part of that Dominion, he com|mitted to the charge of the Lord <HI>Herbert,</HI> elde&s;t Son to the Marquis <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Herbert, <HI>Son of the Earl of</HI> Worce&s;ter, <HI>made General of South</HI> Wales.</NOTE> of <HI>Worcester;</HI> whom he made his Lieutenant General, adding <HI>Mon|mouth-&s;hire</HI> to his Commi&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THERE were, in the opinion of many, great objections again&s;t com|mitting that employment to that noble Lord, who&s;e Per&s;on many Men lov'd, and very few hated. Fir&s;t, he had no knowledge, or experience in the Martial Profe&s;&s;ion; then his Religion, being of that &s;ort of Ca|tholicks <MILESTONE N="10"> the People render'd odious, by accu&s;ing it to be mo&s;t Je&s;uited, Men apprehended would not only produce a greater brand upon the King of favouring Papi&s;ts and Popery, than he had been yet reproach'd with (for, though he had &s;ome Papi&s;ts entertain'd in his Armies, yet all Men tru&s;ted by him in Superior Commands, were Men of unblemi&s;h'd integrity in the Prote&s;tant Religion: and in all his Armies, he had but one General Officer, of the contrary Religion, S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton,</HI> whom the Papi&s;ts notwith&s;tanding would not acknowledge for a Papi&s;t) This gave opportunity and excu&s;e to many Per&s;ons of Quality, and great Intere&s;t in tho&s;e Counties (between whom and that Lord's Family, there <MILESTONE N="20"> had been perpetual Feudes, and Animo&s;ities) to le&s;&s;en their Zeal to the King's cau&s;e, out of jealou&s;y of the others Religion: and tho&s;e conte&s;ta|tions had been lately improv'd with &s;ome &s;harpne&s;s, by the Lord <HI>Her|bert</HI>'s Carriage towards the Lord Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> during the time of his re&s;idence there; when, out of vanity to magnify his own power, he had not &s;hew'd that due regard to that of the other, which he &s;hould have had. And no doubt, if he had been of that mind, it would much more have advanced the King's Service, if he would have contributed his full A&s;&s;i&s;tance to another, who more popularly might have borne the Title of &s;uch a Command. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>BUT on the other &s;ide, the nece&s;&s;ity of di&s;po&s;ing tho&s;e parts, divided from the re&s;t of the Kingdom, under the Command of &s;ome Per&s;on of Honour and Intere&s;t, was very vi&s;ible; and the expedition in doing it was as nece&s;&s;ary; the Parliament being po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and <HI>Bri|stol,</HI> and &s;o having &s;uch an influence upon the Trade and Livelihood of that People, by their ab&s;olute Command of the <HI>Severn,</HI> that except there were extraordinary care of keeping them, they would be quickly lo&s;t. Be&s;ides that, at the &s;ame time, there was di&s;cour&s;e, in the Hou&s;es, <Q>&startq;&endq; of &s;ending the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> thither, who&s;e E&s;tate was very great in tho&s;e parts, and his Reputation equal.</Q> The Parliament had allready <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;uch footing in <HI>Pembroke-&s;hire,</HI> that many of the principal Gentlemen had declared for Them; and the Harbour of <HI>Milford-</HI>Haven gave their Fleet opportunity to give them all &s;upplies, and relief. This being the State of tho&s;e parts, the Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> not only offer'd, but de&s;ired to receive that Command; <Q>and engaged him&s;elf, &startq;not only to &s;ecure it from the Oppo&s;ition, and Malignity of the other Party, but, before the &s;pring, to rai&s;e &s;uch a &s;trength of Hor&s;e, and Foot, and to pro|vide &s;uch an equipage to march with, that might reduce <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and be then added to the King's Army, when he &s;hould be ready to&endq; take the Field;</Q> and all this &s;o much at his own charge (for his Fa|ther, <MILESTONE N="$0"> who was well able, would furni&s;h Money, as was pretended, upon the King's promi&s;e to repay him, <Q>when he &s;hould be re&s;tored to his own) &startq;that he would receive no part of the King's Revenue, or of &s;uch Money,
<PB N="118" REF="1440">
as his Maje&s;ty could be able to draw for the &s;upply of his own more&endq; immediate occa&s;ions.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was a very great offer, and &s;uch as no Man el&s;e could &s;o rea|&s;onably make. For the Marquis of <HI>Worcester</HI> was generally reputed the greate&s;t monied Man of the Kingdom; and, probably, might not think it an unthrifty thing, rather to disbur&s;e it for the King, who might be able to repay it, than to have it taken from him by the other Party; which would be hardly que&s;tionable if They prevailed. The Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> him&s;elf was a Man of more than ordinary Affection and Reverence to the Per&s;on of the King, and one, who, he was &s;ure, would <MILESTONE N="10"> neither deceive nor betray him. For his Religion, it might work upon Him&s;elf, but could not di&s;quiet other Men. For though he were a Pa|pi&s;t, he was never like to make others &s;o; and his Reputation and In|tere&s;t was very great with many Gentlemen of tho&s;e Counties, who were not at all friends to his Religion. It was not po&s;&s;ible to employ any Per&s;on of Intere&s;t, and Power in tho&s;e parts; and there were many objections from the Nature, and Manners of that People, again&s;t a meer Stranger, again&s;t whom there would not be &s;ome Faction, and Animo|&s;ity; for the Emulations, and di&s;&s;ention between Families was general, and notorious: and therefore it would be be&s;t to choo&s;e &s;uch a one, who <MILESTONE N="20"> was like to have a greater Faction for him, than again&s;t him. And it was to be hoped that the old Grudges, and Prejudices, which had been rather again&s;t the Hou&s;e of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and the Popi&s;h Religion pro|fe&s;s'd there, than again&s;t the Per&s;on of this Lord, would have been com|po&s;ed, and declined by his fair and gentle Carriage towards all Men (as in truth he was of a civil, and obliging Nature) and by the publick|heartedne&s;s of tho&s;e, who, for the Cau&s;e, and Con&s;cience &s;ake, would, it was hoped, &s;acrifice all trivial and private contentions to a Union that mu&s;t vindicate the Religion, Honour, and Ju&s;tice of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e rea&s;ons, and the&s;e pre&s;umptions, the King granted &s;uch <MILESTONE N="30"> a Commi&s;&s;ion, as is before mention'd, to the Lord <HI>Herbert;</HI> who, with more expedition than was expected by many, or by others believ'd po&s;|&s;ible, rai&s;ed a Body of above fifteen hundred Foot, and near five hun|dred <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Herbert <HI>rai&s;es a little Army:</HI></NOTE> Hor&s;e, very well and &s;ufficiently Armed; which encrea&s;ed the merit of the &s;ervice.</P>
<P>THE Hor&s;e he put under the Command of his Brother, the Lord <HI>John Somer&s;et,</HI> a maiden Soldier too; and the Foot under Colonel <HI>Lawly,</HI> whom he made his Major General, a bold and a &s;prightly Offi|cer. About the middle of <HI>February</HI> he march'd towards <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> with an ill Omen at his &s;etting out; for a Rabble of the Country People be|ing <MILESTONE N="40"> got together, without Order, or Officer of Name, Barricadoed a lit|tle Village in the Forre&s;t of <HI>Deane,</HI> call'd <HI>Cover</HI> (through which he was to pa&s;s) and refu&s;ed to give him entrance; and out of a Window kill'd Colonel <HI>Lawly,</HI> and two Officers more, without hurting a Common Soldier; whereby that Body was de&s;titute of any Per&s;on of experience to Command them.

But if the Money, which was laid out in Rai&s;ing, Arming, and Paying that Body of Men, which never advanced the King's Service in the lea&s;t de|gree, had been brought into the King's receipt at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to have been imployed to the mo&s;t advantage, I am per&s;waded the War might have been ended the next Summer. <Q>For I have heard the Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> &s;ay, &startq;that tho&s;e preparations, and the other, which by that Defeat were&endq; render'd u&s;ele&s;s, co&s;t above three&s;core thou&s;and pounds;</Q> whereof, though much came from the Marquis's Coffers, yet, no doubt, the ge|neral Contributions from the Catholicks made a good part: and very <MILESTONE N="40"> con&s;iderable Sums were receiv'd by him of the King's Revenue upon Ward&s;hips, and other ways: for it was a common practice in tho&s;e times, for Men to get into employments upon promi&s;es, that they would not do this or that, without which no body el&s;e would undertake that &s;er|vice; and being, upon tho&s;e terms, receiv'd into it, they immediately did the other, becau&s;e no other Man would do the &s;ervice without it.</P>
<P>THE fame of this prodigious Victory &s;o &s;ubdued all tho&s;e parts, that S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> with the &s;ame &s;pirit of celerity, and attended with the &s;ame Succe&s;s, flew to <HI>Hereford;</HI> and though a walled Town, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^$</HI> W.

<PB N="120" REF="1480">
newly Garri&s;on'd; his motion being &s;o quick, that though Prince <HI>Mau|rice</HI> attended him with all po&s;&s;ible diligence, he could never farther en|gage him than in light Skirmi&s;hes; and, having taken this progre&s;s, re|turn'd &s;afe to <HI>Gloucester;</HI> and from thence to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army; having made no other u&s;e of his Conque&s;ts, than the di&s;honouring &s;o many places, which had &s;o quietly yeilded to him; into which (for he fixed no one Garri&s;on) the King's Forces immediately enter'd again. So that his Maje&s;ties Quarters continued the &s;ame they were, hara&s;&s;ed only, and di&s;countenanced, nothing &s;treighten'd by this Incur&s;ion; and the Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> again intended new Levies.</P>
<P>HAVING now, with as much clearne&s;s as I could, remember'd the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The State of</HI> Ireland <HI>at that time with reference to the diffe|rence between the King and the two Hou&s;es Here.</HI></NOTE> true State of the King's Affairs, and the condition of the Kingdom, at the end of this year 1642, with which I intend to conclude this &s;ixth Book; I &s;hall, before I return to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to conclude the year, briefly call to remembrance the di&s;con&s;olate State of <HI>Ireland;</HI> of which, ad|vantage was allways taken again&s;t the King, to render him odious to the People, as if he countenanced, at lea&s;t not &s;ufficiently abhorr'd, that wicked, and unnatural Rebellion. And this Imputation was with &s;o great Art in&s;inuated, that it got credit with many; in&s;omuch as I have heard &s;ome, who could make no other Excu&s;e for adhering to the Par|liament, <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;ay, <Q>&startq;they were per&s;waded that the King favour'd tho&s;e Re|bels;&endq;</Q> <Q>which, they &s;aid, &startq;could not be without &s;ome de&s;ign upon the&endq; Religion, Liberty, and Pro&s;perity of <HI>England.</HI></Q> Whereas I can aver truly, upon as good grounds, as ever any Man &s;poke the heart of an|other, that the King allways look'd upon it, as the mo&s;t groundle&s;s, bloody, and wicked Rebellion, that ever po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Spirits of that Peo|ple; and was not more griev'd at any one circum&s;tance of the Dome&s;tick di&s;tractions, than, as it hinder'd him from cha&s;ti&s;ing, and taking Ven|geance upon the Other: which from his Soul he de&s;ired.</P>
<P>BUT in this di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Ireland,</HI> it cannot be expected, that I &s;hould, <MILESTONE N="30"> neither do I intend to mention all the memorable Actions (in which were great In&s;tances of God's own dete&s;tation of tho&s;e inhuman Rebels, by the &s;ignal Victories he gave again&s;t them) or the other Tran&s;actions within that Kingdom; but &s;hall remember no more of that bu&s;ine&s;s, than had immediate reference to, and dependence on, the difference be|tween the King and the two Hou&s;es of Parliament.</P>
<P>IT is &s;aid before, that when the fir&s;t vi&s;ible rupture was declared be|tween them, which was in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Hull</HI> (which the King under|&s;tood to be a direct levying of War again&s;t him) in the Prote&s;tation made by his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;that he would no farther treat, or concur with them, <MILESTONE N="40"> in any Acts propo&s;ed by them; till he fir&s;t receiv'd reparation, or &s;a|tisfaction&endq; in that particular;</Q> he allways excepted what &s;hould any way concern <HI>Ireland:</HI> in which he offer'd to con&s;ent to what&s;oever might rea&s;onably conduce to the reducing tho&s;e Rebels; and did, after that, concur in &s;ome Propo&s;itions of that Nature. Yet it is certain that, from that time, the two Hou&s;es were &s;o bu&s;y in preparing the War for <HI>England,</HI> that they did very little prepare for the War of <HI>Ireland;</HI> &s;ave only by &s;ome &s;mall &s;upplies of Money and Provi&s;ions. <Q>The King objected to them, &startq;the employing the Monies, rai&s;ed, by Act of Parliament, for the pre&s;ervation and reduction of <HI>Ireland,</HI> with a &s;pecial clau&s;e that the <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;ame &s;hould not be diverted to any other u&s;e what&s;oever, in the &s;up|porting the unnatural War, and Rebellion again&s;t his Maje&s;ty; par|ticularly one hundred thou&s;and pounds at one time; and that many
<PB N="121" REF="1490">
Soldiers, rai&s;ed under pretence of being &s;ent into <HI>Ireland,</HI> were, con|trary to their expectation and engagement, forced to &s;erve under the&endq; Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> again&s;t the King;</Q> of which, he named, S^r <HI>Faithful For|te&s;cue</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e, and the Lord <HI>Wharton</HI>'s, and the Lord <HI>Kerry</HI>'s Regiment of Foot.</P>
<P><Q>TO this they an&s;wer'd, &startq;that albeit they had, upon the urgent occa|&s;ions of this Kingdom, &s;ometimes made u&s;e of Monies rai&s;ed, and col|lected for <HI>Ireland;</HI> yet that they had in due time repaid it, and that the other Affairs had never &s;uffer'd by the Loan: And for the Men, that it proceeded from his Maje&s;ties own default; for after they had <MILESTONE N="10"> rai&s;ed them, with a &s;erious intention to &s;end them into <HI>Ireland,</HI> under the Command of the Lord <HI>Wharton,</HI> the King refu&s;ed to grant a Com|mi&s;&s;ion to him to tran&s;port them, and &s;o they had been compell'd to&endq; u&s;e them in their own Service here.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King replied, &startq;that it appear'd, they had diverted that Money to other U&s;es than tho&s;e for which it was provided; which was mani|fe&s;tly unlawful; and that it did not appear they had again reimbur&s;ed it, becau&s;e very little &s;upply was &s;ent thither, and very much wanted: and for the Soldiers, that They fir&s;t levied them, without his Maje&s;ties leave; which they had allways before asked, for their othe$ Levies; <MILESTONE N="20"> and being levied, they de&s;ired a Commi&s;&s;ion for the Lord <HI>Wharton</HI> to Command them ab&s;olutely, without any dependence upon the Lord Lieutenant of <HI>Ireland;</HI> which had been never heard of, and which his Maje&s;ty refu&s;ed; but offer'd &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion as was granted to&endq; other Men.</Q></P>
<P><Q>ON the other hand, they objected to the King, &startq;the &s;ei&s;ing &s;ome Cart-Hor&s;es at <HI>Chester,</HI> provided for the Train of Artillery for <HI>Ireland;</HI> that his Forces had taken many Cloaths, and Provi&s;ions, on the Road, which were going to <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> to be tran&s;ported thither for the relief of the Soldiers; and that he entertain'd, and countenanced Men in his&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> Court, which were Favourers or Actors in that Rebellion:</Q> naming the Lord Vi&s;count <HI>Costeloe,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Taffe,</HI> which gave great um|brage to tho&s;e who were well affected, and as great encouragement to the Rebels there.</P>
<P><Q>To the fir&s;t, the King confe&s;s'd, &startq;he found about &s;ix&s;core Hor&s;es at <HI>Chester,</HI> which had long lain there; and, at his remove from <HI>Not|tingham,</HI> knowing, the other Hor&s;e and Men, rai&s;ed for <HI>Ireland,</HI> were then marching with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> again&s;t him, he knew not, but the&s;e likewi&s;e might be &s;o imployed, and therefore in his own nece&s;|&s;ity took them for his own draughts. For the Cloaths, which had been <MILESTONE N="40"> taken by his Soldiers, that it proceeded by the default of the Parlia|ment; who, after the War was begun, had &s;ent tho&s;e Carriages through His Quarters, without &s;ending to his Maje&s;ty for a &s;afe Conduct, or giving any notice to him of it, till after they were taken: that it was within two Miles of <HI>Coventry</HI> (which was then in Rebellion) that tho&s;e Cloaths were taken; and that, a&s;&s;oon as he knew they were de&s;ign'd for <HI>Ireland,</HI> his Maje&s;ty had u&s;ed the be&s;t means he could to recover them; but that the Soldiers, who were allmo&s;t naked, had divided them for their own Supplies; and his Maje&s;ty offer'd to give a &s;afe&endq; conduct at all times for what&s;oever &s;hould be de&s;ign'd for <HI>Ireland.</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="50"></P>
<P><Q>THE occa&s;ion of the other reproach, &startq;for countenancing Per&s;ons&endq; who adhered to the Rebels, was this.</Q> The Lords, <HI>Dillon</HI> [Vi&s;count <HI>Costeloe]</HI> and <HI>Taffe,</HI> had, four Months before, pa&s;s'd out of <HI>Ireland</HI> into
<PB N="122" REF="1500">
<HI>England,</HI> having never been in con&s;ort with the Rebels, but &s;o much tru&s;ted by them, that they de&s;ired, by Their hands, to addre&s;s a Petition to the King; <Q>humble enough, de&s;iring &startq;only to be heard, and offering&endq; to &s;ubmit to his Maje&s;ties &s;ingle Judgement.</Q> With this Petition, and all other In&s;tructions, as they pretended, the&s;e Lords acquainted the Lords Ju&s;tices, and Council of <HI>Ireland;</HI> who were &s;o well &s;atisfied with the Per&s;ons employed, that they granted their &s;afe pa&s;s, and &s;ent Let|ters by them of Te&s;timony. They were no &s;ooner Landed in <HI>England,</HI> but they were apprehended, and &s;ent Pri&s;oners to the Parliament, and by them committed with all &s;trictne&s;s, <Q>&startq;as Agents employed by the Re|bels&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> of <HI>Ireland</HI> to the King;</Q> and that Circum&s;tance inforced, and &s;pread among the People, with all licentious glo&s;&s;es again&s;t the King; who, for that rea&s;on, took no notice of their re&s;traint, though from his Mini&s;ters he receiv'd adverti&s;ement of the truth of the whole bu&s;ine&s;s. After &s;ome time was &s;pent in clo&s;e Impri&s;onment, the&s;e Lords, by Petition, and all other Addre&s;&s;es they could make, pre&s;s'd to be brought to any kind of Examination and Tryal; of which they found no other benefit, than that, upon this importunity, their Impri&s;onment was le&s;s clo&s;e; and, by degrees, under a formal re&s;traint (which though more plea&s;ant, was not le&s;s co&s;tly) had the liberty of <HI>London,</HI> and from thence, after <MILESTONE N="20"> four months re&s;traint, without being formally charged with any crime, or brought to any Tryal, which they often de&s;ired, they e&s;caped, and came to <HI>York;</HI> whither a Me&s;&s;enger from the Hou&s;e of Commons fol|low'd them, and demanded them as Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>MANY were of opinion, that they &s;hould have been deliver'd back; fore&s;eeing that the Parliament would pre&s;s the &s;candal of &s;heltering them much to the King's di&s;advantage; <Q>and any imputations, &startq;of coun|tenancing&endq; the Rebels of <HI>Ireland,</HI></Q> found more credit, and made deeper impre&s;&s;ion with the People, <Q>than any other di&s;cour&s;es of &startq;protecting&endq; Malignants, and Delinquents.</Q> On the other &s;ide, it was thought un|rea&s;onable, <MILESTONE N="30"> to remit Men to an Impri&s;onment, which appear'd to have been unju&s;t, by their not being proceeded again&s;t in &s;o long time; e&s;pe|cially when their coming to the King would be declared &s;uch a crime, that it would be now in their Enemies power to cau&s;e them to be pu|ni&s;h'd; which before they could not do; at be&s;t, it were to deliver them up to the Serjeant of the Hou&s;e of Commons, from whence no Inno|cence could redeem them, without paying &s;uch va&s;t fees, as would amount to a greater Sum than they could probably be &s;upplied with. So that the King, who wi&s;h'd that they had rather gone any whither than where He was, re&s;olv'd to take no notice of their e&s;cape. And &s;o <MILESTONE N="40"> they continued in His Quarters, and put them&s;elves into the Troops; where they behaved them&s;elves with good Courage, and frankly en|gaged their Per&s;ons in all dangerous Enterpri&s;es.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e Jealou&s;ies, and Conte&s;ts, the King being vi&s;ibly and con|fe&s;&s;edly unable to &s;end Succours of any kind thither, and the Parliament having enough el&s;e to do, and, in truth, not taking &s;o much pains to pre&s;erve it, as to impute the lo&s;s of it to the King, poor <HI>Ireland</HI> got very &s;mall relief. The Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> Lord Lieutenant of that King|dom, had receiv'd his di&s;patch from the King, before he went to <HI>Shrews|bury.</HI> But when the King thought he would have gone directly to <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Ireland,</HI> his Lord&s;hip return'd to <HI>London;</HI> which en|crea&s;ed the King's jealou&s;y, and prejudice to him; which his former Carriage, and a Letter writ lately by him from <HI>Nottingham,</HI> to the Earl
<PB N="123" REF="1510">
of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> and by Order of Parliament printed, had begot to a great degree. <Q>Shortly after his return to <HI>London,</HI> the Hou&s;e of Com|mons demanded &startq;&endq;to &s;ee the In&s;tructions he had receiv'd from the King;</Q> <Q>which, as it was unrea&s;onable in Them, &s;o he had receiv'd expre&s;s Com|mand from the King, &startq;&endq;not to communicate them.</Q> However, after he had avoided it as long as he could, and They continued Peremptory in the demand, in the end, he produced them to be peru&s;ed by the Com|mittee of both Hou&s;es. The truth is, the Earl's condition was very &s;lip|pery, and allmo&s;t impo&s;&s;ible to be &s;afely managed by the mo&s;t dexterous Per&s;on. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>HE was de&s;ign'd to that employment by the King, &s;hortly upon the death of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> (or rather before; not without &s;ome ad|vice from that Earl) with as great circum&s;tances of grace and favour, as could be; and as a Per&s;on, of whom entirely the King a&s;&s;ured him|&s;elf, being then &s;o ungracious to the Parliament, that as there were &s;ome &s;harp glances at him in that time (which are before remember'd) &s;o no|thing pre&s;erv'd him from a publick exception, but the Intere&s;t of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who&s;e Si&s;ter he had married; whom that Party was not willing to irreconcile. After the Rebellion was broke out in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the King had committed the Carrying on the War to the <MILESTONE N="20"> Hou&s;es, he thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for his Province, to render him&s;elf as gracious to that People as was po&s;&s;ible; and labour'd That with &s;o good effect, and Indu&s;try, that he omitted that care w$ich &s;hould have been ob&s;erv'd in continuing his Intere&s;t at Court. For the King and Queen grew every day le&s;s &s;atisfied with him; which &s;ure he did not with warine&s;s enough provide again&s;t, though, I believe, he had ne|ver unfaithful purpo&s;es towards either of them; but did &s;adly project, by his demeanour, and intere&s;t in the Hou&s;es, to provide &s;o well for <HI>Ireland,</HI> and to go thither in &s;o good a condition, that, being once there, he might be able to &s;erve the King as he &s;hould be required. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>BUT one Man is rarely able to act both tho&s;e parts: For his &s;hewing his In&s;tructions, he gave a rea&s;on, which, if he had been free from all other objections, might appear no ill excu&s;e: <Q>&startq;He knew his In&s;tructions were &s;uch, that, being peru&s;ed by the Committee, could by no mi&s;|con&s;truction, or po&s;&s;ible perver&s;ion, be wre&s;ted to the King's di&s;advan|tage;&endq;</Q> as indeed they never were able, nor ever attempted, to fix any reproach from them upon the King. <Q>&startq;Whereas, after they were &s;o peremptorily required, if he &s;hould have as peremptorily refu&s;ed to &s;ubmit, they would have concluded that there had been &s;omewhat unju&s;tifiable in them, and upon that jealou&s;y made no &s;cruple of publi&s;h|ing&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> the wor&s;t reproaches&punc; upon his Maje&s;ty.</Q> and it may be, he was not without an imagination, that if by this conte&s;t he had drawn the di&s;|plea&s;ure of the two Hou&s;es upon him, as could not be avoided, his mi&s;|fortune at Court might have &s;uffer'd that conte&s;t to have depre&s;s'd him. And when he left the King between <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> his condition was &s;o low at Court, that a Man might have imagined his in|tere&s;t would be be&s;t pre&s;erv'd by being within the Verge of the Parlia|ments Protection. As his return to <HI>London</HI> was be&s;ides the King's ex|pectation, &s;o his &s;tay there was longer than &s;eem'd to be intended by his own propo&s;al; for he &s;tayed there above two Months, till after the <MILESTONE N="50"> Battle of <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> and both Parties being fix'd in their Winter Quar|ters; and then, without waiting again on the King, though <HI>Oxford</HI> was very few Miles out of his way, about the end of <HI>November,</HI> he went
<PB N="124" REF="1520">
to <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> with a purpo&s;e of tran&s;porting him&s;elf for <HI>Ireland,</HI> but without the lea&s;t appearance of addition of Strength, or provi&s;ions from the Parliament; neither were their &s;hips there ready to tran&s;port him.</P>
<P>ABOUT the end of <HI>November,</HI> four Officers of the Army in <HI>Ireland,</HI> S^r <HI>James Montgomery,</HI> S^r <HI>Hardre&s;s Waller,</HI> Colonel <HI>Arthur Hill,</HI> and Colonel <HI>Audly Mervin,</HI> having been employed from <HI>Ireland</HI> to &s;olli|cite the Parliament for Succours, came from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and deliver'd a Petition to the King; <Q>in which they told him, &startq;that they had addre&s;s'd them&s;elves to the Parliament for &s;upplies, who&s;e &s;en&s;e <MILESTONE N="10"> of their Mi&s;eries, and Inclination to redre&s;s them, appear'd very ten|der to them; but the pre&s;ent di&s;tempers of the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> were grown &s;o great, that all future pa&s;&s;ages, by which comfort and life &s;hould be conveyed to that ga&s;ping Kingdom, &s;eem'd totally to be ob&s;tructed; &s;o that, unle&s;s his Maje&s;ty, out of his &s;ingular Wi&s;dom, and fatherly Care, applied &s;ome &s;peedy remedy, his loyal, and di&s;tre&s;s'd Subjects of that Kingdom mu&s;t inevitably peri&s;h. They acknowledg'd, his Princely favour and goodne&s;s &s;ince this Rebellion, &s;o abundantly expre&s;s'd in a deep &s;en&s;e, and lively re&s;entment of their bleeding con|dition: And therefore, they be&s;ought him, among his other weighty <MILESTONE N="20"> Cares, &s;o to reflect upon the bleeding condition of that peri&s;hing King|dom, that timely relief might be afforded. Otherwi&s;e his Loyal Sub|jects there mu&s;t yeild their Fortunes, as a Prey; their Lives, a &s;acri|fice; and their Religion, a Scorn to the mercile&s;s Rebels, powerfully&endq; a&s;&s;i&s;ted from abroad.</Q></P>
<P>AND indeed the condition of the Prote&s;tants, in that Kingdom, was very mi&s;erable: for, whil&s;t the di&s;tractions of <HI>England</HI> kept them from receiving &s;uccours from thence, the Rebels had Armes, Ammunition, Money, and Commanders, from <HI>Rome, Spain,</HI> and <HI>France;</HI> the Pope having &s;ent a formal avow'd Nuntio, to who&s;e juri&s;diction the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> &s;ub|mitted; <MILESTONE N="30"> and the Kings of <HI>France,</HI> and <HI>Spain,</HI> having &s;ent great Sup|plies, and their Agents, to countenance and foment the Rebellion; who gave notable Countenance to the A&s;&s;embly and form'd Council for the Rebels, &s;ettled at <HI>Kilkenny.</HI></P>
<P>THE King, who well knew this Petition was &s;ent by the permi&s;&s;ion of tho&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and that the Agents employed were Men of notorious di&s;affection to him, who look'd for &s;ome &s;uch An&s;wer as might improve the envy of the People, u&s;ed the Me&s;&s;engers with all po&s;&s;ible grace, and return'd them as gracious an An&s;wer: <Q>&startq;That, from the be|ginning of that mon&s;trous Rebellion, he had had no greater &s;orrow, <MILESTONE N="40"> than for the bleeding condition of that his Kingdom. That he had, by all means, labour'd, that timely relief might be afforded to it, and con&s;ented to all Propo&s;itions, how di&s;advantageous &s;oever to Him&s;elf, that had been offer'd to him to that purpo&s;e; and, not only at fir&s;t re|commended their condition to both his Hou&s;es of Parliament, and immediately, of his own meer motion, &s;ent over &s;everal Commi&s;&s;ions, and cau&s;ed &s;ome proportion of Armes, and Ammunition (which the Petitioners well knew to have been a great &s;upport to the Northern parts of that Kingdom) to be conveyed to them out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and offer'd ten thou&s;and Voluntiers to undertake that War; but had often <MILESTONE N="50"> pre&s;s'd, by many &s;everal Me&s;&s;ages, that &s;ufficient &s;uccours might be ha&s;ten'd thither, and other matters of &s;maller importance laid by, which did divert it; and offer'd, and mo&s;t really intended, in his own

<P>THE King being fully inform'd now, as well by this Committee, as from his Mini&s;ters of State in that Kingdom, of the growing power of the Rebels in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and of the weak Re&s;i&s;tance his good Subjects were like to make, who&s;e only hopes depended upon tho&s;e Succours <MILESTONE N="30"> which they pre&s;umed the Lord Lieutenant would bring over with him, and that he was now going thither, without the lea&s;t addition of &s;trength, or probable a&s;&s;urance that any would be &s;ent after him; his Maje&s;ty con&s;ider'd likewi&s;e, that, be&s;ides the damp this naked arrival of the Lord Lieutenant There mu&s;t ca&s;t upon the minds of all, it would make like|wi&s;e a great alteration in the conduct of Affairs there. For upon His landing, the Commi&s;&s;ion to the Earl of <HI>Ormond,</HI> of Lieutenant Gene|ral of the Army, would be determined; and there had tho&s;e jealou&s;ies, and di&s;re&s;pects, pa&s;s'd between the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter</HI> and Him, that the Earl of <HI>Ormond</HI> was re&s;olv'd, no more to continue that Command, but <MILESTONE N="40"> immediately to tran&s;port him&s;elf out of that Kingdom; by which the King &s;hould lo&s;e the &s;ervice of a Per&s;on much the mo&s;t powerful, mo&s;t able, and mo&s;t popular within that Kingdom; and who had, with won|derful Courage and Conduct, and allmo&s;t miraculous &s;ucce&s;s, hitherto re&s;train'd the rage and fury of the Rebels, and indeed a Man &s;o accom|pli&s;h'd, that he had either No Enemies, or Such who were a&s;hamed to profe&s;s they were &s;o.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e con&s;iderations, the King thought fit, for &s;ome time, till he might farther weigh the whole bu&s;ine&s;s, to &s;u&s;pend the Earl of <HI>Lei|ce&s;ter</HI>'s Journey: and therefore &s;ent to him to <HI>Chester</HI> (where he had <MILESTONE N="50"> lain, in &s;ome indi&s;po&s;ition of health, above a fortnight; <Q>and the Ships being not yet come for his Tran&s;portation) &startq;to attend his Maje&s;ty at&endq; <HI>Oxford;</HI></Q> which he did &s;hortly after <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> and continued there;

<P>THIS Me&s;&s;age put a nece&s;&s;ity upon them, of entering again upon the Argument, and gave them who de&s;ired Peace and Accommodation, an opportunity to pre&s;s for the Debate, which had been craftily laid a&s;ide for the di&s;patch of other matters; that Party, which was mo&s;t deeply engaged in the War, and re&s;olv'd to carry it on, having a nota|ble dexterity in keeping tho&s;e things from being Debated, in which they found Their &s;en&s;e would not prevail.

For, be&s;ides that many Per&s;ons, who from the beginning had allways di&s;&s;ented from them, for their ea&s;e and conveniency had &s;tayed among them, very many were convinced in their under&s;tandings, that they had been mi&s;led; and di&s;cerned, in what a bottomle&s;s Gulph of mi&s;ery the Kingdom would be plunged, if an immediate compo&s;ure were not made; and &s;ome of tho&s;e who had been as fierce as any, and given as great countenance to the kindling the fire, either out of con&s;cience that they had done ami&s;s, or fear that the King would prevail by power, or anger that they found other Men valued above them; in their pre&s;ent <MILESTONE N="30"> Di&s;traction, or their natural Incon&s;tancy even in Ill, were mo&s;t &s;ollici|tous for a Treaty. <Q>So that within few days after the receipt of this Me&s;|&s;age, both Hou&s;es agreed &startq;that there &s;hould be a Treaty, in which &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg">Both Hou&s;es agree there &s;hould be a Treaty; and they &s;end for a &s;afe conduct.</NOTE> much of the King's Propo&s;itions as concern'd the Magazins, Forts, and Ships, and the Propo&s;ition of both Hou&s;es for the disbanding the Ar|mies, &s;hould be fir&s;t treated on, and concluded, before the proceeding to treat upon any of the other Propo&s;itions; and that the Treaty &s;hould begin the fourth of <HI>March,</HI> or &s;ooner if it might be; and that, from&endq; the beginning,</Q> the time &s;hould not exceed twenty days. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>

&s;aw a Ce&s;&s;ation, in order to re&s;toring the King to his Rights) but would le&s;&s;en the Forces he had already; in that the Army con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t of Men engaged by the Pay, not affection to the Cau&s;e; who, upon &s;uch a remi&s;&s;ion of duty as would nece&s;&s;arily attend a Ce&s;&s;ation, would abandon a Party, which they fore&s;aw, upon a Peace, mu&s;t be condemn'd, though it might be &s;ecure: And whereas all Overtures of a Treaty hitherto had advanced their Levies upon pretence of be|ing in a po&s;ture not to be contemn'd, they believ'd, a real Ce&s;&s;ation&endq; would render tho&s;e Levies impo&s;&s;ible.</Q></P>
<P><Q>OTHERS thought &startq;any Ce&s;&s;ation di&s;advantageous enough to the King; and therefore, that the terms, upon which it was to be made, were to be preci&s;ely look'd to: that the Articles propo&s;ed would only produce a &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of pre&s;ent Acts of Ho&s;tility, and Blood, among the Soldiers; but not give the lea&s;t ta&s;t of Peace, or admit the lea&s;t benefit to the People; for that all Intercour&s;e, and Conver&s;ation was inhibited, in &s;o much as no Per&s;on of the King's Party, though no Soldier, had liberty to vi&s;it his Wife, or Family, out of the King's Quarters, during this Ce&s;&s;ation; and the hindering Recruits could on|ly prejudice the King, not at all the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who had at pre&s;ent a greater Army than ever before; and the City of <HI>London</HI> was &s;uch a Magazine of Men, as could &s;upply him upon very &s;mall warning. Be|&s;ides, though the State of the King's Army and Quarters, about <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> was &s;uch as might receive &s;ome advantage by a Ce&s;&s;ation; yet, in the We&s;t, it was hoped his Affairs were in the bud; and the Earl of <HI>New-Castle</HI> was &s;o much Ma&s;ter in the North, that if a Peace en&s;ued not (which wi&s;e Men did not believe was &s;eriou&s;ly intended on the Par|liaments part, by rea&s;on the Propo&s;itions to be treated on, were &s;o unrea&s;onable, and impo&s;&s;ible to be con&s;ented to) &s;uch a Ce&s;&s;ation would hinder the motion and progre&s;s of the Earl's good fortune, and give time to the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> who was at pre&s;ent very low, to put him|&s;elf&endq; into &s;uch a po&s;ture as might give new trouble.</Q> And 'tis certain the Northern Forces had then great dread of this Ce&s;&s;ation.</P>
<P>TO the&s;e con&s;iderations was added another of greater moment, and which could be le&s;s an&s;wer'd by any acce&s;s of benefit, and advantage on the King's Party. Hitherto the Parliament had rai&s;ed their va&s;t Sums of Money, for the &s;upport of their Army (which could only be &s;upported by con&s;tant great pay) and for the di&s;charge of their other im|men&s;e expences, incident to &s;uch a Rebellion, from the City of <HI>Lon|don,</HI> and principally from their Friends, not daring &s;o rigidly to execute their Ordinances generally, but contented them&s;elves with &s;ome &s;evere&punc;judgements upon particular Men, whom they had branded with &s;ome extraordinary mark of Malignancy, out of <HI>London,</HI> &s;ave only that they gleaned among their own Zealots upon voluntary Collections, and plun|der'd by their Army, which brought no &s;upply to their Common Stock: And of what they impo&s;ed upon Cities, and Towns, wherein they had Garri&s;ons (in which they had been likewi&s;e very tender) they had re|ceiv'd very little; not venturing yet, by any general Tax, and Impo&s;i|tion upon the People, to inflame them, and inform them how they meant to invade their Liberty, and their Property, with the jealou&s;y whereof, they had blown them up to all tho&s;e &s;wellings, and &s;editious humours&punc; again&s;t the King; and apprehending, that if they &s;hould attempt That, any encouragement of &s;trength from any of the King's Armies, would make the whole Kingdom ri&s;e again&s;t them.</P>
<P><PB N="131" REF="1590">
BUT now, after they had agreed to a Treaty, and framed even Arti|cles for a Ce&s;&s;ation; they pa&s;s'd an Ordinance for a Weekly A&s;&s;e&s;&s;ment <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Hou&s;es pa&s;s an Ordi|nance for a Weekly A&s;&s;e&s;&s;|ment on the whole King|dom.</NOTE> throughout the Kingdom, towards the &s;upport of the War; by which, was impo&s;ed upon the City of <HI>London</HI> the weekly Sum of ten thou&s;and pounds, and upon the whole Kingdom no le&s;s than a weekly Payment of thirty three thou&s;and five hundred and eighteen pounds, amounting in the year to one Million &s;even hundred forty two thou&s;and nine hundred thirty &s;ix pounds; a prodigious Sum for a People to bear, who, before this War, thought the payment of two Sub&s;idies in a year, which, in the be&s;t times, never amounted to above two hundred thou&s;and <MILESTONE N="10"> pounds, and never in our Age to above a hundred and fifty, an in&s;up|portable burthen upon the Kingdom: Which indeed had &s;carce borne the &s;ame, under all the Kings that ever Reign'd.</P>
<P>FOR the &s;peedy and exact collection whereof, they appointed, by the &s;ame Ordinance, Commi&s;&s;ioners in each County, &s;uch as were &s;ufficient|ly inclined to, and engaged in Their de&s;igns. To this they added other Ordinances, for exacting the twentieth part, and other payments, throughout the Kingdom; which had been only undergone (and that not generally) in <HI>London;</HI> and, above all, for the &s;eque&s;tering, and &s;ei&s;ing of the E&s;tates of all who adhered to the King. <Q>&startq;Now if a Ce&s;&s;ation <MILESTONE N="20"> were con&s;ented to by the King, on the Articles propo&s;ed, and thereby the King's Forces lock'd up within the &s;everal limits and narrow bounds, in which they were contein'd, the&s;e Ordinances n$ght be exe|cuted throughout all their Quarters; and thereby va&s;t Sums be rai&s;ed. Their great A&s;&s;ociation of <HI>Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridge, Huntington, Bedford,</HI> and <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> (in neither of which the King had any vi&s;ible Par|ty, or one fixed Quarter) upon which, the apprehen&s;ion of the Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI>'s advance upon them, kept them from notable pre&s;&s;ures, would by this means yeild them a great &s;upply of Men, and Money.

<P>THESE con&s;iderations made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon tho&s;e, who be|liev'd the Treaty was not like to produce a Peace; the Number of which was encrea&s;ed by a new re&s;olution, at this time enter'd upon, and vi|gorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted, <Q>&startq;to fortify the City of <HI>London,</HI> and to draw a line&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The City of</HI> London <HI>for|tified.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"> about it;</Q> which was executed with marvellous expedition; which, many believ'd, would not have been then done, both for the charge and jealou&s;y of it, if it had not been re&s;olv'd it &s;hould not Yet return to the King's obedience. And many Per&s;ons of Honour, and Quality, about the King, who had given great life to his Affairs, were &s;o &s;tartled with the &s;en&s;e of it, that they addre&s;s'd them&s;elves together to his Maje&s;ty, and be&s;ought him, <Q>&startq;that they might not lo&s;e That now, by an unequal Ce&s;&s;ation, which had been pre&s;erv'd for them, during the Licence of Ho&s;tility; and that His, and Their Enemies, might not be That way enabled to de&s;troy them, which Yet they dur&s;t not attempt to do by any&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's propo&s;als of Alterations in the two Hou&s;es Arti|cles of Ce&s;&s;a|tion.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="$0"> Other.</Q> The King hereupon, after &s;olemn Debates in Council, the chief Officers of his Army being pre&s;ent, re&s;olv'd to make &s;uch Alterations in the Articles, as might make the terms a little more equal, at lea&s;t pre|vent &s;o into lerable di&s;advantages.</P>

<P><Q>AND his Maje&s;ty told them, &startq;he hoped, the&s;e &s;mall Alterations would &s;ufficiently manife&s;t, how &s;ollicitous he was for the good of his People, for who&s;e Liberties he &s;hould in&s;i&s;t, when in matters meerly concerning Him&s;elf, he might de&s;cend to ea&s;ier conditions; and how de&s;irous he was, that, in this unnatural Contention, no more blood of his Subjects might be &s;pilt, upon which he look'd with much Grief, Compa&s;&s;ion, and Tenderne&s;s of Heart, even on the blood of tho&s;e, who had lifted up their hands again&s;t him.

For the fir&s;t, of Mediation, they pretended a Title, and obligation to it; by a Clau&s;e in the Act of Pacification made at the beginning of this Parliament; <Q>which Clau&s;e was: &startq;That the Peace to be then e&s;tabli&s;h'd, might be inviolably ob&s;erv'd, in all time to come, it was agreed, that &s;ome &s;hould be appointed by his Maje&s;ty, and the Parliaments of both Kingdoms, who, in the interim betwixt <MILESTONE N="10"> the &s;itting of the Parliaments, might be careful, that the Peace then happily concluded might be continued; and who &s;hould endeavour by all means to prevent all troubles, and divi&s;ions; and if any debate and difference &s;hould happen to ari&s;e, to the di&s;turbance of the Common Peace, they &s;hould labour to remove, or compo&s;e them, according to their power; it being &s;uppo&s;ed, that for all their proceedings of this Kind, they &s;hould be an&s;werable to the King's Maje&s;ty and the Parlia|ment; and if any thing &s;hould fall out that &s;hould be above their power, and could not be remedied by them, they &s;hould inform them|&s;elves in the particulars, and repre&s;ent the &s;ame to the King's Maje&s;ty, <MILESTONE N="$0"> and the en&s;uing Parliament; that, by their Wi&s;doms and Authority, all occa&s;ion and cau&s;es of troubles might be removed, and the Peace of the Kingdom might be perpetual to all po&s;terity. And it was de|clared, that the power of the Commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould be re&s;train'd to the&endq; Articles of Peace in that Treaty.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Clau&s;e, and the whole Statute, being carefully peru&s;ed, and examined before his Maje&s;ty in his Council, the King return'd an An&s;wer to them in writing.</P>
<P><Q>&startq;THAT He could not find any colour, or pretence of Authority, to <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's An&s;wer to them in both particulars.</NOTE> be granted by that Act of Parliament, by which the Commi&s;&s;ioners <MILESTONE N="$0"> for <HI>Scotland</HI> could conceive them&s;elves intere&s;&s;ed in a faculty of Me|diation; that the Clau&s;e mention'd by them (be&s;ides that there was no &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ion granted as was mention'd in that Clau&s;e, nor any Commi&s;&s;ioners named for tho&s;e purpo&s;es) related only to the diffe|rences that might grow between the two Nations; and only upon the Articles of that Treaty, which, his Maje&s;ty &s;aid, had been, and &s;hould be inviolably ob&s;erv'd by Him. That the differences between his Ma|je&s;ty and his two Hou&s;es of Parliament, had not the lea&s;t Relation to the Peace between the two Kingdoms, but to his unque&s;tionable, and long enjoyed Rights, which, his Rebellious Subjects endeavour'd, by <MILESTONE N="$0"> Force, to wre&s;t from him; and concern'd the fundamental Laws of this Kingdom; which, as they could not be &s;uppo&s;ed to be known to the Con&s;ervators of the Peace of <HI>Scotland,</HI> &s;o They could not have any po&s;&s;ible Cogni&s;ance of them. That it might give great Umbrage to his Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> if he &s;hould con&s;ent to what they now propo&s;ed; and, in&s;tead of confirming, and continuing the Peace, breed jealou&s;ies between the Nations; and therefore he could not admit of any &s;uch Mediation as They propo&s;ed; but that he hoped the Treaty, which he now expected, would beget &s;o good an under&s;tanding be|tween Him and his two Hou&s;es, that a Peace might en&s;ue; towards&punc; which he would expect nothing from his Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> but&endq; their Prayers.</Q></P>
<P>THIS gave them no &s;atisfaction, but they in&s;i&s;ted &s;till on their right
<PB N="145" REF="1730">
by that Clau&s;e, which, without any Rea&s;on or Argument to per&s;wade others to be of their mind, they &s;aid, <Q>&startq;they conceiv'd, laid that obliga|tion&endq; upon them of interpo&s;ition; to which the King &s;till gave the &s;ame An&s;wer.</Q></P>
<P>FOR their Other demand of a Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> the ca&s;e &s;tood thus: The King, at his la&s;t being in <HI>Scotland,</HI> had, according to the Pre|cedent he had made Here, granted an Act for Triennial Parliaments in that Kingdom; and, at the clo&s;e of that pre&s;ent Parliament, had ratified another Act, by which, a certain day was appointed, for the Commence|ment of the next; which day was to be on the fir&s;t <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> of <HI>June,</HI> in <MILESTONE N="10"> the year 1644, except the King &s;hould call one &s;ooner; which he had power to do. So that the que&s;tion was only, whether the calling a Par|liament &s;ooner in that Kingdom, was like to advance His &s;ervice, and to contribute to the Peace of This? In the di&s;qui&s;ition whereof, there need|ed no Arguments, that &s;uch a Convention could not then produce benefit to the King; the entire Government of that People being in tho&s;e Per|&s;ons, who had contrived tho&s;e di&s;mal alterations. On the other hand, all Men thought it very happy for the King, that, without His con&s;ent, there could be no Parliament in <HI>Scotland,</HI> till <HI>June</HI> 1644; which was more than fourteen Months from this time: till when, how di&s;inclin'd <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;oever the whole Nation &s;hould be, there was as much A&s;&s;urance, as could po&s;&s;ibly be, from that People, that the Parliament $ould not be able to procure any avow'd &s;upply from that Kingdom: It being the ex|pre&s;s words in the late Act of Pacification, <Q>&startq;that the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould not denounce, or make War again&s;t the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,&endq;</HI> without con&s;ent of the Parliament of <HI>England;</HI></Q> as on the other part, it was enacted, <Q>&startq;that the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;hould not denounce, or make War again&s;t the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> without the con&s;ent of the Parliament of <HI>Scotland.</HI> And in ca&s;e any of the Subjects of either of the Kingdoms &s;hould ari&s;e in Armes, or make War again&s;t the other King|dom, <MILESTONE N="30"> or Subjects thereof, without con&s;ent of the Parliament of that Kingdom, whereof they are Subjects, or upon which they do depend, that they &s;hould be held, reputed, and demanded, as Traytors to the E&s;tates, whereof they are Subjects. And, that both the Kingdoms, in that ca&s;e, &s;hould be bound to concur in the repre&s;&s;ing of tho&s;e that &s;hould happen to ari&s;e in Armes, or make War, without con&s;ent of&endq; their own Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>SO that whoever believ'd, that tho&s;e People could be contain'd by any obligations, Divine, or Humane, thought it impo&s;&s;ible, by the&s;e clear Texts, that any Forces could be rai&s;ed there to invade <HI>England,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="40"> di&s;turb his Maje&s;ty, till <HI>June</HI> 1644; before which time, there was hope the King might &s;o far prevail, that the &s;pirit of the Rebellion might be broken, and Men return again to their Under&s;tanding, and Allegiance. Therefore to that demand, the King return'd An&s;wer, <Q>&startq;that again&s;t the&endq; time by which they could legally demand a Parliament</Q> (naming the day) <Q>&startq;he would i&s;&s;ue out his Writs, and there being no emergent Cau&s;e to do it &s;ooner, he would forbear to put his Subjects there to that trouble, which tho&s;e meetings, how nece&s;&s;ary &s;oever, would naturally&endq; carry with them.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN they perceiv'd that they &s;hould not receive &s;atisfaction in ei|ther <MILESTONE N="50"> of their Propo&s;als, and (which it may be troubled them more) that the King was &s;o wary in his An&s;wers, and &s;o clearly expre&s;s'd the Rea|&s;ons, and Ju&s;tice of them, that they &s;hould have no Arguments to apply
<PB N="146" REF="1740">
to the pa&s;&s;ion, or intere&s;t, of their Country-men; which they expected at lea&s;t (For in that, in which he was mo&s;t &s;tedfa&s;tly re&s;olv'd, the pre&s;erva|tion of the Government of the Church, he expre&s;s'd no more to them, than, <Q>&startq;That being a matter of &s;o great importance, and having &s;o near Relation to the Civil Government, and Laws of <HI>England,</HI> They could not be competent con&s;iderers of it; but that He would do what &s;hould be mo&s;t &s;afe, and nece&s;&s;ary for the peace and welfare of his Subjects,&endq; who were mo&s;t concern'd in it) At la&s;t rather cur&s;orily,</Q> and as matter of Ceremony at parting, than of moment, <Q>they de&s;ired &startq;the King's leave,&endq; and Pa&s;s to go to <HI>London,</HI></Q> having, as they &s;aid, <Q>&startq;&s;ome bu&s;ine&s;s there&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> before their return into their own Country.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was, by many, thought a thing of &s;o &s;mall moment, that the King &s;hould readily grant it; &s;ince it was evident, that it was in their own power to go thither without his leave; for they were nece&s;&s;arily to return through the Enemies Quarters; and being once there, they might choo&s;e whether they would go directly home, or vi&s;it <HI>London.</HI> And there|fore that reque&s;t was thought but an In&s;tance of their mode&s;ty, that they might not return without one thing granted to them, at their reque&s;t. But the King look'd upon it as no indifferent thing; and their asking a bu&s;ine&s;s that they needed not ask, was enough to demon&s;trate, that there <MILESTONE N="20"> was more in it than appeared. And he well knew, there was a great dif|ference between their going to <HI>London</HI> with His Pa&s;s, and Licence, and without it, which they might ea&s;ily do. They had now publickly declared their Errand, and claim'd a Title, and Legal Capacity to undertake the bu&s;ine&s;s of Mediation; which would be &s;o far from being rejected there, that they would be thankfully receiv'd, and admitted to a power of Um|pirage. If upon, or after this claim, the King &s;hould grant them His Pa&s;s, it would, by their Logick, more rea&s;onably conclude his A&s;&s;ent, than ma|ny of tho&s;e inferences which they drew from more di&s;tant Propo&s;itions; and having that ground once, his Maje&s;ties not con&s;enting to what tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="30"> grave Mediators would propo&s;e, and afterwards, as Arbitrators, award, &s;hould be quarrel &s;ufficient for the whole Nation to Engage. And there|fore the King expre&s;sly denied his Pa&s;s, and &s;afe conduct; and told them plainly the rea&s;on why he did &s;o; <Q>and required them, &startq;&s;ince he had de|nied to con&s;ent to that, which could be the only ground of their go|ing to <HI>London,</HI> that they &s;hould fir&s;t return to tho&s;e that &s;ent them, before they attempted that Journey: if they did otherwi&s;e, they mu&s;t run the hazard of Per&s;ons, whom his Maje&s;ty would not countenance&endq; with His Protection.</Q> And the truth is, though they might very well have gone to <HI>London,</HI> they could not have return'd thence to <HI>Scotland</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> (except they would have &s;ubmitted to the inconvenience and hazard of a Voyage by Sea) without &s;o much danger from the King's Quarters in the North <HI>(York,</HI> and <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> being at His devotion) that they could not rea&s;onably promi&s;e them&s;elves to e&s;cape.</P>
<P>WHILST this was in agitation, the Committee from the Parliament <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ments Com|mi&s;&s;ioners to Treat came to</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> for the Treaty, to wit, the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> M^r <HI>Peirrepoint,</HI> S^r <HI>W.

<P>ASSOON as the Committee arriv'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> they were very gra|ciou&s;ly <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Treaty be|gins upon the Propo&s;als of Ce&s;&s;ation, but that takes no effect.</NOTE> receiv'd by the King; his Maje&s;ty allways giving them Audience in Council, and They withdrawing into a private Chamber prepared for them, whil&s;t their Propo&s;als, which they &s;till deliver'd in writing, were con&s;ider'd, and debated before the King. <Q>They declared, &startq;that they were fir&s;t to Treat of the Ce&s;&s;ation, and till that was concluded, that they&endq; were not to enter upon any of the other Propo&s;itions;</Q> with which his <MILESTONE N="10"> Maje&s;ty was well plea&s;ed, pre&s;uming that they had brought, or had power to give, con&s;ent to the Articles propo&s;ed by him; which he rather be|liev'd, when they read the preamble to the Articles; <Q>in which it was de|clared, &startq;that the Lords and Commons being &s;till carried on with a vehe|ment de&s;ire of Peace, that &s;o the Kingdom might be freed from the de&s;o|lation, and de&s;truction, wherewith it was like to be overwhelm'd, had con&s;ider'd of the Articles of Ce&s;&s;ation with tho&s;e alterations, and addi|tions, offer'd by his Maje&s;ty; unto which they were ready to agree in &s;uch&endq; manner as was expre&s;s'd in the en&s;uing Articles.</Q> After which, were in|&s;erted the very Articles had been fir&s;t &s;ent to the King, without the lea&s;t <MILESTONE N="20"> conde&s;cen&s;ion to any one Alteration, or Addition, made by him; neither had the Committee power to recede or con&s;ent to any Alteration, but only to publi&s;h it, if the King con&s;ented in Terms, and Then, and not till Then, to proceed to Treat upon the other Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>THIS the King look'd upon as an ill Omen; other Men as a plain Con|tempt, and Stratagem, to make the People believe by their &s;ending their Committee, that they did de&s;ire a Treaty and a Ce&s;&s;ation, yet, by limiting them &s;o &s;trictly, to fru&s;trate Both, and to ca&s;t the Envy of it upon the King. Hereupon, the next day, the King &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to them, which he publi&s;h'd, to undeceive the People; <Q>farther pre&s;&s;ing &startq;the weight and <MILESTONE N="30"> con&s;equence of his former exceptions, and alterations; and the incon|venience that proceeded from not granting their Committee power to alter &s;o much as verbal Expre&s;&s;ions: &s;o that, if the King &s;hould con&s;ent to the Articles, as they were propo&s;ed, he &s;hould not only &s;ubmit to great di&s;advantages; but &s;ome &s;uch, as Them&s;elves would not think rea|&s;onable to oblige him to. As by that Article wherein they re&s;erv'd a power to &s;end out a Fleet, or what Ships They thought good, to Sea; they were not at all re&s;train'd, from &s;ending what Land Forces they plea&s;ed, to any part of the Kingdom; &s;o that, when the Ce&s;&s;ation ended, they might have new, and greater Armies throughout the Kingdom, than <MILESTONE N="40"> they had when it begun; which, he pre&s;umed, they did not intend; be|ing&endq; a thing &s;o unequal, and contrary to the Nature of a Ce&s;&s;ation.</Q></P>

the not agreeing upon the One, might not de&s;troy the hopes of, nor &s;o much as delay the Other; He was willing to Treat, even without a Ce&s;|&s;ation, upon the Propo&s;itions them&s;elves, in that order that was agreed; and de&s;ired their Committee might be enabled to that effect. In which&endq; Treaty he would give,</Q> he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;all his Subjects that &s;atisfaction, that if any &s;ecurity to enjoy all the Rights, Priviledges, and Liberties, due to them by the Law, or that happine&s;s in Church and State, which the be&s;t times had &s;een, with &s;uch farther Acts of Grace, as might agree with his Honour, Ju&s;tice, and Duty to his Crown, and which might not render him le&s;s able to protect his Subjects, according to his Oath, would &s;a|tisfy <MILESTONE N="10"> them; his Maje&s;ty was confident, in the Mercy of God, that no&endq; more precious blood of this Nation would be thus mi&s;erably &s;pent.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Me&s;&s;age produced Liberty to the Committee to enter upon the Treaty it &s;elf, upon the Propo&s;itions, though the Ce&s;&s;ation &s;hould not be agreed to: and &s;hortly after they &s;ent rea&s;ons to the King, why they con|&s;ented not to the Ce&s;&s;ation in &s;uch manner, and with tho&s;e limitations, as He had propo&s;ed. 1. <Q>They alledged, &startq;that, if they &s;hould grant &s;uch a free Trade, as the King de&s;ired, to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and other places, where his Forces lay, it would be very difficult, if not impo&s;&s;ible, to keep Armes, Ammunition, Money, and Bullion, from pa&s;&s;ing to his Army: How|ever, <MILESTONE N="20"> it would be exceeding advantageous to his Maje&s;ty, in &s;upplying his Army with many nece&s;&s;aries, and making their Quarters a Staple for &s;uch Commodities, as might be vented in the adjacent Counties; and &s;o draw Money thither; whereby the Inhabitants would be better enabled by Loanes, and Contributions, to &s;upport his Army. As this advantage to Him was very Demon&s;trable, &s;o it was very Improbable, that it would produce any &s;upply to Them; and, in a Treaty for Ce&s;&s;a|tion, tho&s;e demands could not be thought rea&s;onable that were not in|different, that is, equally advantageous to both Parties. 2. That to de|mand the approving the Commanders of the Ships, was, to de&s;ire to add <MILESTONE N="30"> the &s;trength of the one Party to the other, before the differences were ended; again&s;t all Rules of Treaty. And to make a Ce&s;&s;ation at Sea, was to leave the Kingdom naked to Forreign Forces, and the Ports open for His &s;upplies of Armes, and Ammunition. But for conveying any Forces, by tho&s;e means, from one part to the other, they would ob&s;erve the Ar|ticles, by which that was re&s;train'd. 3. For the expre&s;&s;ion of the Army rai&s;ed by the Parliament, they were contented it &s;hould be alter'd, and the name of the two Hou&s;es u&s;ed. 4. For the Committing none, but ac|cording to the known Laws of the Land, that is, by the ordinary Proce&s;s of Law, it would follow, that no Man mu&s;t be committed by Them for <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;upplying the King with Armes, Money, or Ammunition; for, by the Law of the Land, the Subject might carry &s;uch goods from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Oxford:</HI> The Soldiers mu&s;t not be committed who do run from their Colours, and refu&s;e any duty in the Army; no Man &s;hould be com|mitted, for not &s;ubmitting to nece&s;&s;ary &s;upplies of Money: &s;o that if it &s;hould be yeilded to, in his Maje&s;ties &s;en&s;e, they &s;hould be di&s;abled to re&s;train &s;upplies from their Enemies, and to govern, and maintain their own Soldiers; and &s;o, under a di&s;gui&s;e of a Ce&s;&s;ation, &s;hould admit that which would nece&s;&s;arily produce the di&s;&s;olving of their Army, and de|&s;truction&endq; of their Cau&s;e.</Q> And, they &s;aid, <Q>&startq;it was not probable, that his Maje&s;ty would &s;uffer the &s;ame inconveniences by that Clau&s;e; for that <MILESTONE N="50"> they believ'd he would interpret, that what his General did by Vertue of His Commi&s;&s;ion, was and would be done according to the known
<PB N="149" REF="1770">
Laws of the Land; whereas he had denied, that tho&s;e known Laws gave any power to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, to rai&s;e Armes; and &s;o, con&s;equently, their General could not exerci&s;e any martial Laws. So that under the &s;pecious &s;hew of Liberty, and Law, They &s;hould be alltogether di&s;abled to defend their Liberties and Laws; and his Maje&s;ty would enjoy an ab&s;olute Victory, and Submi&s;&s;ion, under pretence of a&endq; Ce&s;&s;ation, and Treaty.</Q> They &s;aid, <Q>&startq;being, by a nece&s;&s;ity inevitable, en|forced to a Defen&s;ive War, and therein warranted both by the Laws of God and Man, it mu&s;t needs follow, that, by the &s;ame Law, they were enabled to rai&s;e means to &s;upport that War; and therefore they could <MILESTONE N="10"> not relinqui&s;h that power of laying Taxes upon tho&s;e who ought to joyn with them in that Defence, and the nece&s;&s;ary way of levying tho&s;e Taxes upon them, in ca&s;e of refu&s;al; for otherwi&s;e their Army mu&s;t&endq; needs be di&s;&s;olv'd.</Q></P>
<P>Though the&s;e Rea&s;ons were capable, in a &s;ad, and compo&s;ed debate, of full An&s;wers, and many things would naturally have flow'd from them, to di&s;prove the Practice and A&s;&s;ertions of the framers of them; yet it was very evident, that they carried &s;uch a kind of rea&s;on with them, as would prevail over the under&s;tandings of the People; and that the King, by not con&s;enting to the Ce&s;&s;ation, as it was propo&s;ed by them, would be <MILESTONE N="20"> generally thought to have rejected Any; which could not but have an ill influence upon his Affairs: and therefore his Maje&s;ty &s;ent t$em, a&s;&s;oon as he had weighed this late Me&s;&s;age, which he well di&s;cern'd was not form'd to &s;atisfy him, but to &s;atisfy the People again&s;t him, an An&s;wer; in which he explain'd the ill con&s;equence of many of their A&s;&s;umtions, and in|forced the importance of his former demands on the behalf of the Peo|ple; <Q>however, he offer'd &startq;to admit the Ce&s;&s;ation upon the matter of their own Articles; &s;o that he might not be under&s;tood to con&s;ent to any of&endq; tho&s;e unju&s;t, and illegal powers, which they exerci&s;ed upon the Subjects.</Q> But from henceforward, the Hou&s;es declin'd any farther Argument, and <MILESTONE N="30"> Debate concerning the Ce&s;&s;ation; <Q>and directed their Committee, &startq;to ex|pedite&endq; the Treaty upon the Propo&s;itions: the Particulars whereof be|ing tran&s;acted in the beginning of the year 1643.</Q> I &s;hall refer the Narra|tive to the next Book; intending in This, only to comprehend the Tran&s;|actions to the end of 1642.</P>
<P>I AM per&s;waded if the King had, upon the receipt of the Articles for the Ce&s;&s;ation, when they were fir&s;t &s;ent to him, frankly con&s;ented to it, it would have prov'd very much to his advantage; and that His Army would very much have encrea&s;ed by it, and the Other been impaired; and that it would have been very difficult for the Parliament to have di&s;|&s;olv'd <MILESTONE N="40"> it, if once begun, or to have determin'd the Treaty. But be&s;ides the rea&s;ons before mention'd, the con&s;ideration of the Northern Forces, and the re&s;training them within their old Quarters, who &s;eem'd to be in a condition of marching even to <HI>London</HI> it &s;elf, prevail'd very far with the King; or rather (which indeed was the main rea&s;on, and render'd every other Sugge&s;tion of Weight) the jealou&s;y that they did not intend to con|&s;ent to, or admit any Peace, but &s;uch a one as his Maje&s;ty might Not admit, made all the preliminary debates the more in&s;i&s;ted on.</P>
<P>I CANNOT but in&s;ert one Particular, which may hereafter be thought of &s;ome &s;ignification. It was now the time of the year when, by the cu|&s;tom <MILESTONE N="$0"> of the Kingdom, the King's Judges <HI>Itinerant</HI> u&s;ed to go the Circuits throughout <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Wales,</HI> to admini&s;ter Ju&s;tice to the People; and to enquire into all Trea&s;ons, Felonies, Breaches of the Peace, and other
<PB N="150" REF="1780">
mi&s;demeanours; which were any where committed contrary to the known Laws; and they were &s;worn to judge according to tho&s;e known Laws, the &s;tudy and knowledge whereof was their profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>THE Lords and Commons now &s;ent to the King a &s;pecial Me&s;&s;age, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The advice and de&s;ires of the two Hou&s;es concerning Goal-delivery.</NOTE> &startq;to advi&s;e, and de&s;ire him, that, in regard of the pre&s;ent di&s;tractions, which might hinder both the Judges, and the People, from re&s;orting to tho&s;e places where &s;uch meetings might be appointed, the A&s;&s;izes and Goal-delivery might not be holden; but that it might be deferr'd, un|til&endq; it &s;hould plea&s;e God to re&s;tore Peace unto his People.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King return'd them An&s;wer; &startq;that the pre&s;ent bloody di&s;tra|ctions <NOTE PLACE="marg">His Majesties An&s;wer.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"> of the Kingdom, which he had u&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible means to prevent, and would &s;till to remove, did afflict his Maje&s;ty under no con&s;ideration more, than of the great interruption, and &s;top it made in the Cour&s;e and Proceedings of Ju&s;tice, and the Execution of the Laws; whereby his good Subjects were robb'd of the Peace, and Security they were born to. And therefore, as much as in Him lay, he would advance that only means of their happine&s;s; at lea&s;t, they &s;hould &s;ee that their &s;ufferings that way, proceeded not from his Maje&s;ty; and &s;ince they might now expect, by the Laws, Statutes, and Cu&s;toms of the Kingdom, the A&s;&s;izes and general Goal-delivery in every County, his Maje&s;ty thought not fit <MILESTONE N="20"> to command the contrary; but would take &s;evere, and preci&s;e order, that None of his Subjects &s;hould receive the lea&s;t prejudice, as they re|paired thither, by any of his Forces, which rule he &s;hould be glad to &s;ee ob&s;erv'd by others. And then he hoped, by the execution of the Laws, even tho&s;e publick Calamities might have &s;ome abatement, and&endq; the Kingdom recover its former Peace, and Pro&s;perity.</Q></P>
<P>BUT this An&s;wer was not more &s;atisfactory than others they had u&s;ually receiv'd from him; <Q>and therefore they betook them&s;elves to their old, tryed Weapon, and made an <HI>Ordinance,</HI> &startq;that all Judges, and Ju&s;tices <NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Hou&s;es make an Ordinance to forbid the next A&s;&s;izes, and Goal-de|livery.</NOTE> of A&s;&s;ize, and <HI>Ni&s;i prius,</HI> and Ju&s;tices of <HI>Oyer,</HI> and <HI>Terminer,</HI> and Goal-delivery, <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;hould forbear to execute any of their &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ions, or to hold or keep any A&s;&s;izes, or Goal-delivery, at any time during that Lent Vacation; as they would An&s;wer the contempt, and neglect there|of,&endq; before the Lords and Commons in Parliament.</Q> This was the fir&s;t avow'd Interruption, and Su&s;pen&s;ion of the publick Ju&s;tice, that hap|pen'd, or that was known ever before in that kind; and gave the People occa&s;ion to believe, that what the Parliament did (what pretence &s;oever there was of Fundamental Laws) was not &s;o warrantable by that Rule, &s;ince they labour'd &s;o much to &s;uppre&s;s that inqui&s;ition. It was not in the King's power to help this; for be&s;ides that the example of Judge <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Mallet,</HI> who, the Circuit before, had been forcibly taken from the Bench by a Troop of Hor&s;e, as is before remember'd, terrified all the Judges (and there were very few Counties in <HI>England,</HI> in which they could have been &s;ecure from the like violence) the Records, upon which the Legal pro|ceedings were to be, were at <HI>London;</HI> and &s;o the exerci&s;e of the Law cea&s;ed throughout the Kingdom, &s;ave only in &s;ome few Counties, whi|ther the King &s;ent &s;ome Judges of A&s;&s;ize, and into others, his Commi&s;|&s;ion of <HI>Oyer</HI> and <HI>Terminer;</HI> by virtue whereof, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and many others, were as legally attainted of High Trea&s;on, as the wi&s;dom of our Ance&s;tors could direct. <MILESTONE N="50"></P>

He was a Man of very good parts, and an excellent under&s;tanding; yet, which is no common infirmity, &s;o diffident of him&s;elf, that he was &s;ometimes led by Men who judged much wor&s;e. He was of a great, and haughty Spirit, and &s;o pun|ctual in point of Honour, that he never &s;werv'd a tittle. He had &s;o entire a Re&s;ignation of him&s;elf to the King, that he abhorr'd all Artifices to &s;helter him&s;elf from the prejudice of tho&s;e, who, how powerful &s;oever, fail'd in their duty to his Maje&s;ty; and therefore he was pur&s;ued with all <MILESTONE N="$0"> imaginable malice by them, as One that would have no quarter, upon &s;o infamous Terms, as but looking on whil&s;t his Ma&s;ter was ill u&s;ed. As he had receiv'd great bounties from the King, &s;o he &s;acrificed all he had to his Service, a&s;&s;oon as his occa&s;ions &s;tood in need of it; and lent his Ma|je&s;ty, at one time, twenty thou&s;and pounds together; and, a&s;&s;oon as the War begun, engaged his three Brothers, all Gallant Gentlemen, in the &s;ervice; in which they all lo&s;t their Lives.

and had no de&s;ign of making advantage from it. For, though he was a Man of very good parts, and conver&s;ant in Books, both in the Latin and Greek Languages, and of a clear Courage, of which he had given frequent Evidence; yet he was &s;o wholely given up to a Country life, where he liv'd in &s;plendour, that he had an aver&s;ion, and even an unapt|ne&s;s, for Bu&s;ine&s;s: Be&s;ides his particular Friend&s;hip with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who&s;e Si&s;ter he had married, his greate&s;t acquaintance and con|ver&s;ation had been with tho&s;e, who had the reputation of being be&s;t af|fected to the Liberty of the Kingdom, and lea&s;t in love with the hu|mour of the Court; many of whom were the chief of tho&s;e, who en|gaged <MILESTONE N="10"> them&s;elves mo&s;t factiou&s;ly, and furiou&s;ly again&s;t the King. But a&s;&s;oon as he di&s;cern'd their violent purpo&s;es again&s;t the Government e&s;tabli&s;h'd, before he &s;u&s;pected their blacker de&s;igns, he &s;evered him&s;elf from them; and, from the beginning of the Parliament, never concurr'd with them in any one Vote di&s;honourable to the King, or in the pro|&s;ecution of the Earl of <HI>Strafford.</HI> He did accept the Government of the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> as is mention'd before, purely out of obedience to the King; and, no doubt, it was a great &s;ervice; though for the per|formance of the Office of a Governour, he never thought him&s;elf fit, nor medled with it. He left <HI>York,</HI> as is remember'd, to form an Army <MILESTONE N="20"> for the King in the We&s;t, where his Intere&s;t was; but he found tho&s;e parts &s;o corrupted, and an Army from the Parliament was poured down &s;o &s;oon upon him, that there was nothing for the pre&s;ent to be done worthy of his pre&s;ence; &s;o that he &s;ent the &s;mall party, that was with him, farther We&s;t to <HI>Cornwal;</HI> where, by degrees, they grew able to rai&s;e an Army, with which they joyn'd with him afterwards again; and him&s;elf return'd to the King at <HI>Oxford,</HI> about the time when the Treaty begun.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Southampton</HI> was indeed a great Man in all re&s;pects, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Earl of</HI> Southampton.</NOTE> brought very much Reputation to the King's Cau&s;e. He was of a nature <MILESTONE N="30"> much inclined to Melancholy, and being born a younger Brother, and his Father, and his Elder Brother dying upon the point together, whil&s;t he was but a Boy, he was at fir&s;t much troubled to be call'd <HI>my Lord;</HI> and with the noi&s;e of Attendance; &s;o much he Then delighted to be alone. He had a great Spirit; he had never had any conver&s;ation in the Court, nor obligation to it. On the contrary, he had undergone &s;ome hard&s;hip from it; which made it believ'd, that he would have been ready to have taken all occa&s;ions of being &s;evere towards it. And therefore, in the be|ginning of the Parliament, no Man was more courted by the Managers of tho&s;e De&s;igns. He had great di&s;like of the High Cour&s;es, which had <MILESTONE N="$0"> been taken in the Government, and a particular prejudice to the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> for &s;ome exorbitant proceedings. But, a&s;&s;oon as he &s;aw the ways of reverence and duty towards the King declined, and the pro&s;e|cution of the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> to exceed the limits of Ju&s;tice, he op|po&s;ed them vigorou&s;ly in all their proceedings. He was a Man of great &s;harpne&s;s of Judgement, a very quick Apprehen&s;ion, and that readine&s;s of Expre&s;&s;ion upon any &s;uddain Debate, that no Man deliver'd him&s;elf more advantageou&s;ly, and weightily, and more efficaciou&s;ly with the hearers; &s;o that no Man gave them more trouble in his oppo&s;ition, or drew &s;o many to a concurrence with him in opinion. He had no rela|tion <MILESTONE N="50"> to, or dependence upon the Court, or purpo&s;e to have any; but wholely pur&s;ued the publick Intere&s;t. It was long before he could be prevail'd with to be a Coun&s;ellor, and longer before he would be ad|mitted

<P>THE Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> was a Man of a grave a&s;pect, of a pre&s;ence <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Earl of</HI> Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> that drew re&s;pect, and of long experience in Affairs of great Importance. He had been, by the extraordinary favour of King <HI>James</HI> to his Per|&s;on (for he was a very hand&s;ome Man) and his parts, which were na|turally great, and had been improv'd by good Education at home and abroad, &s;ent Emba&s;&s;adour into <HI>Spain,</HI> before he was thirty years of Age; and afterwards in &s;everal other Emba&s;&s;ies; and at la&s;t, again in|to <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Spain;</HI> where he Treated, and Concluded the Marriage between the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> and that Infanta; which was afterwards di&s;&s;olv'd. He was by King <HI>James</HI> made of the Privy Council, Vice-Chamberlain of the Hou&s;ehold, an Earl, and a Gentleman of the Bed-Chamber to the Prince, and was then cru&s;h'd by the power of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> and the prejudice the Prince him&s;elf had contracted again&s;t him, during his Highne&s;s's being in <HI>Spain;</HI> upon which he was impri&s;on'd upon his return; and after the Duke's death, the King retain'd &s;o &s;trict a Memory of all that Duke's Friend&s;hips and Di&s;plea&s;ures, that the Earl of <HI>Bristol</HI> could never recover any admi&s;&s;ion to Court; but liv'd in the Country, in ea&s;e, and plenty in his Fortune, and in great Repu|tation with all who had not an implicit Reverence for the Court; and before, and in the beginning of the Parliament, appear'd in the head

<P>THE Lord <HI>Dun&s;more</HI> had been made a Privy Coun&s;ellor, after &s;o many, who had de&s;erv'd wor&s;e, had been call'd thither; and was rea|dy <MILESTONE N="40"> to do whatever he was directed; he was a Man of a rough, and tem|pe&s;tuous Nature, violent in pur&s;uing what he wi&s;h'd, without judge|ment, or temper to know the way of bringing it to pa&s;s; however, he had &s;ome kind of power with froward and di&s;contented Men; at lea&s;t he had credit to make them more indi&s;po&s;ed.

<P>THE Lord <HI>Savil</HI> was likewi&s;e of the Council, being fir&s;t Controller, and then Trea&s;urer of the Hou&s;ehold, in recompence of his di&s;covery of all the Trea&s;ons, and Con&s;piracies, after they had taken effect, and <MILESTONE N="10"> could not be puni&s;h'd. He was a Man of an Ambitious and re&s;tle&s;s Nature; of Parts and Wit enough; but, in his di&s;po&s;ition, and incli|nation, &s;o Fal&s;e, that he could never be believ'd, or depended upon. His particular Malice to the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> which he had &s;uck'd in with his Milk (there having allways been an immortal Feud between the Families; and the Earl had &s;hrewdly overborne his Father) had engaged him with all Per&s;ons who were willing, and like to be able, to do Him mi&s;chief. And &s;o, having opportunity when the King was at the <HI>Berks,</HI> and made the fir&s;t unhappy Pacification, to enter into conver&s;ation, and acquaintance, with tho&s;e who were then employed <MILESTONE N="20"> as Commi&s;&s;ioners from the <HI>Scots,</HI> there was a &s;ecret Intelligence en|ter'd into between them from that time; and he was a principal In|&s;trument to engage that Nation, to march into <HI>England</HI> with an Ar|my; which they did the next year after. To which purpo&s;e, he &s;ent them a Letter, &s;ign'd with the Names of &s;everal of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> No|bility, inviting them to enter the Kingdom, and making great promi&s;es of A&s;&s;i&s;tance; which Names were forged by him&s;elf, without the pri|vity of tho&s;e who were named. And when all this mi&s;chief was brought to pa&s;s, and he found his credit in the Parliament not &s;o great as other Mens, he in&s;inuated him&s;elf into credit with &s;ome body, who brought <MILESTONE N="30"> him to the King or Queen, to whom he confe&s;s'd all he had done to bring in the <HI>Scots,</HI> and Who had con&s;pired with him, and all the &s;ecrets he knew, <Q>with a thou&s;and Prote&s;tations &startq;to repair all by future Loyalty,&endq; and Service;</Q> for which he was promi&s;ed a White Staff, which the King had then re&s;olv'd to take from S^r <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> who held it with the Secre|taries Office; which he had accordingly; though all his di&s;covery was of no other u&s;e, than that the King knew many had been Fal&s;e, whom he could not puni&s;h; and &s;ome, whom he could not &s;u&s;pect. When the King came to <HI>York,</HI> where this Lord's Fortune, and Intere&s;t lay, his Reputa|tion was &s;o low, that the Gentlemen of Intere&s;t, who wi&s;h'd well to the <MILESTONE N="40"> King's Service, would not communicate with him; and, after the King's remove from thence, the Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> found cau&s;e to have &s;uch a jealou&s;y of him, that he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to impri&s;on him; and after|wards &s;ent him to <HI>Oxford;</HI> where he &s;o well purged him&s;elf, that he was again re&s;tored to his Office. But in the end he behaved him&s;elf &s;o ill, that the King put him again out of his place, and committed him to Pri&s;on, and never after admitted him to his pre&s;ence; nor would any Man of Quality ever after keep any corre&s;pondence with him.</P>

SECRETARY <HI>Nicholas</HI> was a very hone&s;t, and indu&s;trious Man, and allways ver&s;ed in bu&s;ine&s;s; which few of the other were, or had been.

High Admiral of <HI>England;</HI> which was &s;uch a quick &s;ucce&s;&s;ion of Boun|ties and Favours, as had rarely befallen any Man, who had not been attended with the Envy of a Favourite. He was, in all his deportment, a very great Man, and that which look'd like Formality, was a Pun|ctuality in pre&s;erving his dignity, from the inva&s;ion and intru&s;ion of bold Men, which no Man of that Age &s;o well pre&s;erv'd him&s;elf from. Though his Notions were not large or deep, yet his temper, and re|&s;ervedne&s;s in di&s;cour&s;e, and his re&s;ervedne&s;s in &s;peaking, got him the Reputation of an Able, and a Wi&s;e Man; which he made evident in the excellent Government of his Family, where no Man was more ab|&s;olutely <MILESTONE N="$0"> obeyed; and no Man had ever fewer idle words to An&s;wer for; and in debates of importance, he allways expre&s;s'd him&s;elf very perti|nently. If he had thought the King as much above Him, as he thought Him&s;elf above other con&s;iderable Men, he would have been a good Sub|ject; but the extreme undervaluing tho&s;e, and not enough valuing the King, made him liable to the impre&s;&s;ions, which they who approach'd him by tho&s;e Addre&s;&s;es of Reverence, and E&s;teem, that u&s;ually in&s;inuate into &s;uch Natures, made in him. So that after he was fir&s;t prevail'd upon, not to do that which in honour and gratitude he was obliged to (which is a very pe&s;tilent corruption) he was, with the more Facility, <MILESTONE N="$0"> led to concur in what, in Duty and Fidelity, he ought not to have done, and which at fir&s;t he never intended to have done. And &s;o he concurr'd in all the Coun&s;els which produced the Rebellion, and &s;tayed with them to &s;upport it; which is as much, as is nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ay of him in this place, &s;ince there will be often occa&s;ion hereafter to mention him, with &s;ome enlargement.</P>

Whil&s;t there was tranquillity in the Kingdom, he enjoyed his full &s;hare in Pomp and Greatne&s;s; the largene&s;s and plentifulne&s;s of his Fortune being at|tended with reverence, and dependence from the People where his E&s;tate, and Intere&s;t lay, and where indeed he was a great Man; getting an affection and e&s;teem from Per&s;ons who had no dependence upon him, by his magnificent living, and di&s;cour&s;ing highly of Ju&s;tice, and of the Prote&s;tant Religion; inveighing bitterly again&s;t Popery, and telling what <MILESTONE N="$0"> he u&s;ed to &s;ay to the King; and &s;peaking frankly of the over&s;ights of the Court, that he might not be thought a Slave to it. He had been bred, from his Cradle, in the Court; and had that perfection of a Cour|tier, that as he was not wary enough in offending Men, &s;o he was for|ward in acknowledging it, even to his Inferiors, and to impute it to his pa&s;&s;ion, and ask pardon for it; which made him be thought a well natur'd Man.

<P>FROM this time, he took him&s;elf to be ab&s;olv'd from all obligations, and dependence upon the Court, which he had liv'd too long in, to be willing to quit; and therefore the more clo&s;ely adhered to Them by who&s;e power he thought he might get thither again; and, for &s;ome time, entertain'd the hope of obtaining the other Superior White Staff; <MILESTONE N="20"> which remain'd then in the King's hand by the departure of the Earl of <HI>Arundel</HI> into the parts beyond the Seas. But when he &s;aw that Staff given to the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> who was then made Lord Steward of the Hou&s;ehold, he gave over tho&s;e weak imaginations, and concurr'd roundly in all the Lord <HI>Say</HI> propo&s;ed; and was &s;o weak &s;till, as to be|lieve They never meant to Rebel again&s;t the King; or that the King could long &s;ub&s;i&s;t, without putting him&s;elf into Their hands. When They had any thing to do in the We&s;t, as the exerci&s;e of the Militia, or executing any other Ordinance, they &s;ent him into the Country, and &s;hew'd him to the People, under the conduct of two or three Mem|bers <MILESTONE N="30"> of the Hou&s;e, in whom they could Confide; <Q>and he talk'd &startq;of the King's evil Coun&s;ellors, who carried him from his Parliament; and&endq; of the Malignants;</Q> and again&s;t Scandalous Mini&s;ters; whil&s;t none of his old Friends came near him.

No Man had credit enough with him, to corrupt him in point of Loyalty to the King, whil&s;t he thought him&s;elf Wi&s;e enough to know, what Trea&s;on was. But the new Doctrine, and di&s;tinction of Allegiance, and of the King's power in and out of Parliament, and the new Notions <MILESTONE N="10"> of Ordinances, were too hard for him, and did really intoxicate his under&s;tanding, and made him quit his own, to follow Theirs, who, he thought, wi&s;h'd as well, and judg'd better than him&s;elf. His vanity di&s;po&s;ed him to be his Excellency; and his Weakne&s;s, to believe that he &s;hould be the General in the Hou&s;es, as well as in the Field; and be able to govern their Coun&s;els, and re&s;train their Pa&s;&s;ions, as well as to Fight their Battles; and that, by this means, he &s;hould become the Pre&s;erver, and not the De&s;troyer of the King and Kingdom. With this ill grounded Confidence, he launch'd out into that Sea, where he met with nothing but Rocks and Shelves, and from whence, he could never <MILESTONE N="20"> di&s;cover any &s;afe Port to Harbour in.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Salisbury</HI> had been born and bred in Court, and had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Earl of</HI> Salisbury.</NOTE> the advantage of a de&s;cent from a Father, and a Grandfather, who had been very Wi&s;e Men, and great Mini&s;ters of State in the Eyes of <HI>Chri&s;ten|dom;</HI> who&s;e Wi&s;dom and Virtues died with them, and their Children only inherited their Titles. He had been admitted of the Council to King <HI>James;</HI> from which time he continued &s;o ob&s;equious to the Court, that he never fail'd in overacting all that he was required to do. No Act of power was ever propo&s;ed, which He did not advance, and execute His part with the utmo&s;t rigour. No Man &s;o great a Tyrant in his <MILESTONE N="$0"> Country, or was le&s;s &s;wayed by any motives of Ju&s;tice or Honour. He was a Man of no words, except in Hunting, and Hawking. In matters of State, and Council, he allways concurr'd in what was propo&s;ed For the King, and cancell'd and repaired all tho&s;e tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, by con|curring in all that was propo&s;ed Again&s;t him, a&s;&s;oon as any &s;uch Propo|&s;itions were made. Yet when the King went to <HI>York,</HI> He likewi&s;e at|tended upon his Maje&s;ty; and, at that di&s;tance, &s;eem'd to have recover'd &s;ome Courage, and concurr'd in all Coun&s;els which were taken to unde|ceive the People, and to make the proceedings of the Parliament odious to all the world. But, on a &s;uddain, he cau&s;ed his Hor&s;es to attend him out of the Town, and having placed fre&s;h ones at a di&s;tance, he fled back to <HI>London,</HI> with the expedition &s;uch Men u&s;e, when they are mo&s;t af|fraid; and never after denied to do any thing that was required of him; and when the War was ended, and <HI>Cromwell</HI> had putdown the Hou&s;e of Peers, he got him&s;elf to be cho&s;en a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons; and &s;ate with them, as of their own Body; and was e&s;teem'd accordingly.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> was of the King's Council too, but was not <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Earl of</HI> Warwick.</NOTE> wonder'd at for leaving the King, whom he had never well &s;erv'd; nor did he look upon him&s;elf as obliged by that Honour, which, he knew, was conferr'd upon him in the croud of tho&s;e whom his Maje&s;ty had no e&s;teem of, or ever propo&s;ed to tru&s;t; &s;o His bu&s;ine&s;s was to joyn with tho&s;e to whom he owed his promotion. He was a Man of a plea&s;ant, and companiable Wit, and conver&s;ation; of an univer&s;al Jollity; and
<PB N="160" REF="1930">
&s;uch a licence in his Words, and in his Actions, that a Man of le&s;s Vir|tue could not be found out: &s;o that one might rea&s;onably have believ'd, that a Man &s;o qualified, would not have been able to have contributed much to the overthrow of a Nation, and Kingdom. But with all the&s;e faults, he had great Authority and Credit with that People, who, in the beginning of the Troubles, did all the mi&s;chief; and by opening his doors, and making his Hou&s;e the Rendezvous of all the &s;ilenced Mini&s;ters, in the time when there was Authority to &s;ilence them, and &s;pending a good part of his E&s;tate, of which he was very prodigal, upon them, and by being pre&s;ent with them at their Devotions, and making him&s;elf <MILESTONE N="$0"> merry With them, and At them, which they di&s;pen&s;ed with, he became the head of That Party; and got the Style of a Godly Man. When the King revok'd the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion of Admiral, He pre&s;ently accepted the Office from the Parliament; and never quitted their Service; and when <HI>Cromwell</HI> disbanded that Parliament, he betook him&s;elf to the protection of the Protector; married his Heir to his Daughter; and liv'd in &s;o entire a confidence, and friend&s;hip with him, that when the Protector dyed, he exceedingly lamented him. He left his E&s;tate, which before was Subject to a va&s;t debt, more improv'd and re|pair'd, than any Man who traffick'd in that de&s;perate Commodity of <MILESTONE N="$0"> Rebellion.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> had grown up under the &s;hadow of the Court, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Earl of</HI> Holland.</NOTE> and had been too long a Coun&s;ellor before, and contributed too much to the Coun&s;els which had mo&s;t prejudiced the Crown, to have declined waiting upon it, when it needed Attendance. But he cho&s;e to &s;tay with the Parliament; and there hath been enough &s;aid of him before, and more mu&s;t be &s;aid hereafter. And therefore it &s;hall &s;uffice Now, to &s;ay, that there was a very froward fate attended all, or mo&s;t of the Po&s;terity of that bed, from whence He and his Brother of <HI>Warwick</HI> had their ori|ginal; though He, and &s;ome others among them, had many very good Parts, and excellent Endowments.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> of the whole Cabal, was, in a thou&s;and re|&s;pects, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Earl of</HI> Manche&s;ter.</NOTE> mo&s;t unfit for the Company he kept. He was of a gentle, and a ge|nerous Nature; civilly bred; had Reverence and Affection for the Per|&s;on of the King, upon whom he had attended in <HI>Spain;</HI> lov'd his Coun|try with too unskilful a tenderne&s;s; and was of &s;o excellent a temper, and di&s;po&s;ition, that the barbarous times, and the rough parts he was forced to act in them, did not wipe out, or much deface tho&s;e Marks: in&s;omuch as he was never guilty of any rudene&s;s towards tho&s;e he was obliged to oppre&s;s, but perform'd allways as good Offices towards his old Friends, and all other Per&s;ons, as the iniquity of the time, and the nature of the Employment he was in, would permit him to do; which kind of humanity could be imputed to very few.</P>
<P>HE was at la&s;t di&s;mi&s;s'd, and remov'd from any Tru&s;t, for no other rea&s;on, but becau&s;e he was not Wicked enough.

degree defray the expences of the Court, forced him too &s;oon to retire to a Country Life; and totally to abandon both the Court, and <HI>Lon|don;</HI> whither he came very &s;eldom in many years. And in this retire|ment, the di&s;countenance which his Father underwent at Court, the conver&s;ation of that Family into which he was Married, the bewitching Popularity, which flow'd upon him with a wonderful torrent, and the want of tho&s;e Guards which a good Education &s;hould have &s;upplied him with, by the clear Notion of the Foundation of the Eccle&s;ia&s;tical, as well as the Civil Government, made a great impre&s;&s;ion upon his Un|der&s;tanding (for his Nature was never corrupted, but remain'd &s;till in <MILESTONE N="10"> it's Integrity) and made him believe that the Court was inclined to hurt, and even to de&s;troy the Country; and from particular In&s;tances to make general, and dangerous conclu&s;ions. They who had been all|ways Enemies to the Church prevail'd with him to le&s;&s;en his reverence for it, and having not been well in&s;tructed to defend it, he yeilded too ea&s;ily to tho&s;e who confidently a&s;&s;aulted it; and thought it had great er|rors, which were nece&s;&s;ary to be reform'd; and that all means are law|ful to compa&s;s that which is nece&s;&s;ary. Whereas the true Logick is, that the thing de&s;ired is not nece&s;&s;ary, if the ways are unlawful which are propo&s;ed to bring it to pa&s;s. No Man was courted $ith more ap|plication, <MILESTONE N="$0"> by Per&s;ons of all conditions, and qualities; and $is Per&s;on was not le&s;s acceptable to tho&s;e of &s;teddy and uncorrupted Principles, than to tho&s;e of deprav'd inclinations. And in the end, even his Piety admi|ni&s;ter'd &s;ome excu&s;e to him; for his Father's infirmities, and tran&s;gre&s;|&s;ions, had &s;o far expo&s;ed him to the inqui&s;ition of Ju&s;tice, that the Son found it nece&s;&s;ary to procure the A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and Protection of tho&s;e who were &s;trong enough to violate Ju&s;tice it &s;elf; and &s;o he adhered to tho&s;e who were be&s;t able to defend his Father's Honour, and thereby to &s;ecure his own Fortune; and concurr'd with them in their mo&s;t violent de|&s;igns, and gave reputation to them. And the Court as unskilfully took an occa&s;ion too &s;oon to make him de&s;perate, by accu&s;ing him of High Trea&s;on, when (though he might be guilty enough) he was, without doubt, in his Intentions, at lea&s;t, as innocent as any of the leading Men.</P>
<P>IT is &s;ome Evidence, that God Almighty &s;aw his heart was not &s;o malicious as the re&s;t, that he pre&s;erv'd Him to the end of the confu&s;ion; when he appear'd as glad of the King's Re&s;toration, and had heartily wi&s;h'd it long before, and very few, who had a hand in the contrivance of the Rebellion, gave &s;o manife&s;t tokens of Repentance as He did; and having, for many years, undergone the jealou&s;y, and hatred of <HI>Crom|well,</HI> as one who abominated the Murther of the King, and all the Bar|barous proceedings again&s;t the Lives of Men in cold Blood; the King upon his return receiv'd him into grace and favour, which he never af|ter forfeited by any undutiful behaviour.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t of tho&s;e Coun&s;ellors which were made after the faction <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Lord</HI> Say.</NOTE> prevail'd in Parliament, who were all made to advance an Accommo|dation, and who adhered to the Parliament, was the Lord <HI>Say;</HI> a Man, who had the deepe&s;t hand in the original Contrivance of all the Cala|mities which befel this unhappy Kingdom, though he had not the lea&s;t thought of di&s;&s;olving the Monarchy, and le&s;s of levelling the Ranks, and Di&s;tinctions of Men. For no Man valued him&s;elf more upon his Title, or had more Ambition to make it greater, and to rai&s;e his For|tune, which was but moderate for his Title. He was of a proud, moro&s;e, and &s;ullen Nature; conver&s;ed much with Books, having been bred a

Scholar, and (though nobly born) a Fellow of New College in <HI>Oxford;</HI> to which he claim'd a right, by the Alliance he pretended to have from <HI>William</HI> of <HI>Wickham,</HI> the Founder; which he made good by a far fetch'd Pedigree, through &s;o many hundred years, half the time whereof extingui&s;hes all relation of kindred. However upon that pretence, that College hath been &s;eldom without one of that Lord's Family. His parts were not quick, but &s;o much above many of his own Rank, that he had allways great Credit, and Authority in Parliament; and the more, for taking all opportunities to oppo&s;e the Court; and He had, with his Milk, &s;uck'd in an implacable Malice again&s;t the Government of the Church. <MILESTONE N="10"> When the Duke of <HI>Buckingham</HI> propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, after his return with the Prince from <HI>Spain,</HI> to make him&s;elf Popular, by breaking that match, and to be gracious with the Parliament, as for a &s;hort time he was, he re&s;olv'd to embrace the friend&s;hip of the Lord <HI>Say;</HI> who was as &s;ollicitous to climb by that Ladder. But the Duke quickly found him of two imperious, and pedantical a Spirit, and to affect too dan|gerous mutations; and &s;o ca&s;t him off; and from that time he gave over any pur&s;uit in Court, and liv'd narrowly in the Country; having conver&s;ation with very few, but &s;uch who had great Malignity again&s;t the Church and State, and fomented their inclinations, and gave them <MILESTONE N="20"> in&s;tructions how to behave them&s;elves with caution, and to do their bu&s;ine&s;s with mo&s;t &s;ecurity; and was in truth the Pilot, that &s;teer'd all tho&s;e Ve&s;&s;els which were freighted with Sedition to de&s;troy the Go|vernment.</P>
<P>HE found allways &s;ome way to make profe&s;&s;ions of duty to the King, and made &s;everal undertakings to do great Services, which he could not, or would not, make good; and made ha&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of any preferment he could compa&s;s, whil&s;t his Friends were content to attend a more proper conjuncture. So he got the Ma&s;ter&s;hip of the Wards &s;hortly after the beginning of the Parliament, and was as &s;ollicitous to <MILESTONE N="30"> be Trea&s;urer after the death of the Earl of <HI>Bedford;</HI> and, if he could have &s;atisfied his rancour in any degree again&s;t the Church, he would have been ready to have carried the Prerogative as high as ever it was. When he thought there was mi&s;chief enough done, he would have &s;topp'd the current, and have diverted farther fury; but he then found he had only authority, and credit to do hurt; none to heal the wounds he had given; and fell into as much contempt with tho&s;e whom he had led, as he was with tho&s;e whom he had undone.</P>
<P>THE la&s;t of the Coun&s;ellors who &s;tayed with the Parliament, was <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of S^r</HI> Henry Vane <HI>the elder.</HI></NOTE> S^r <HI>Henry Vane;</HI> who had &s;o much excu&s;e for it, that, being thrown out <MILESTONE N="$0"> of Court, he had no whither el&s;e to go; and promi&s;ed him&s;elf to be much made of by Them, for who&s;e &s;akes only he had brought that in|famy upon him&s;elf. He was of very ordinary parts by Nature, and had not cultivated them at all by Art; for he was Illiterate. But being of a &s;tirring and boi&s;terous di&s;po&s;ition, very indu&s;trious, and very bold, he &s;till wrought him&s;elf into &s;ome employment. He had been acquainted with the vici&s;&s;itudes of Court, and had undergone &s;ome &s;evere Morti|fication, by the disfavour of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> in the beginning of the King's Reign. But the Duke was no &s;ooner dead (which made it believ'd that he had made his Peace in his life time, for the King was not, in a long time after, reconciled to any Man who was eminently in the Dukes disfavour) but he was again brought into the Court, and made a Coun&s;ellor, and Controller of the Hou&s;ehold; which place he became

well, and was fit for; and if he had never taken other preferment, he might probably have continued a good Subject. For he had not incli|nation to change, and in his judgement he had liked the Government both of Church, and State; and only de&s;ired to rai&s;e his Fortune, which was not great, and which he found many ways to improve. <Q>And he was wont to &s;ay, &startq;that he never had de&s;ired other preferment; and believ'd, that Marquis <HI>Hamilton</HI> (with whom he had never kept fair quarter) when he fir&s;t propo&s;ed to him to be Secretary of State, did it to affront&endq; him;</Q> well knowing his want of Ability for the di&s;charge of that Office. But, without doubt, as the fatal preferring him to that place was of un|&s;peakable <MILESTONE N="10"> prejudice to the King, &s;o his receiving it was to his own de|&s;truction. His malice to the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> (who had unwi&s;ely pro|voked him, wantonly, and out of contempt) tran&s;ported him to all ima|ginable thoughts of Revenge; which is a Gue&s;t, that naturally di&s;quiets, and tortures tho&s;e who entertain it, with all the perplexities they con|trive for others; and That di&s;po&s;ed him to &s;acrifice his Honour and Faith, and his Ma&s;ter's Intere&s;t, that he might ruin the Earl, and was buried Him&s;elf in the &s;ame ruin; for which being ju&s;tly cha&s;ti&s;ed by the King, and turn'd out of his Service, he was left to his own de&s;pair; and, though he concurr'd in all the malicious de&s;igns again&s;t the King, and again&s;t the <MILESTONE N="$0"> Church, he grew into the hatred, and contempt, of tho&s;e who had made mo&s;t u&s;e of him; and dyed in univer&s;al reproach, and not contemn'd more by any of his Enemies, than by his own Son; who had been his principal Conducter to De&s;truction.</P>

<P>TO this An&s;wer, by which they required at lea&s;t to go whole Sharers <MILESTONE N="10"> with him in his Soveraignty, the King replied, <Q>&startq;That he knew not what proportion of his Revenue had been made u&s;e of by his two Hou&s;es, but he had rea&s;on to believe, if much of it had not been u&s;ed, very much remain'd &s;till in their hands; his whole Revenue being &s;o &s;topp'd, and &s;ei&s;ed on, by the orders of one or both Hou&s;es, even to the taking of his Money out of his Exchequer, and Mint, and Bonds (forced from his Cofferers Clerk) for the Provi&s;ions of his Hou&s;ehold; that very little had come to his u&s;e for his own &s;upport, but he would be well contented to allow what&s;oever had been employed in the main|tenance of his children, and to receive the Arrears due t$ him&s;elf, and <MILESTONE N="20"> to be &s;ure of his own for the future.

<P><Q>TO that part which concern'd the Ships, the King told them, &startq;that he expected his own Ships &s;hould be deliver'd to him, as by the Law <MILESTONE N="$0"> they ought to be; and that when he &s;hould think fit to nominate a Lord High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> it &s;hould be &s;uch a Per&s;on again&s;t whom no ju&s;t exception could be made; and if any &s;hould be, he would allways leave him to his due Tryal, and Examination; and he would grant his Office to him by &s;uch Letters Patents, as had been u&s;ed.

<P>IT is evident to all Men Where the difference now lay between them, being whether the King would re&s;erve the di&s;po&s;al of tho&s;e Offices and Places of Tru&s;t to Him&s;elf, which all Kings had enjoyed, and was in|deed a part of his Regality, or whether he would be content with &s;uch a Nomination, as, being to pa&s;s, and depend upon Their approbation, no Man &s;hould ever be admitted to them, who was nominated by Him. <Q>The Committee, upon his Maje&s;ties An&s;wer, de&s;ired to know, &startq;whe+ther he did intend, that both Hou&s;es &s;hould expre&s;s their confidence of the Per&s;ons, to who&s;e tru&s;t tho&s;e places were to be committed; for that they were directed by their In&s;tructions, that, if his Maje&s;ty was plea&s;ed to a&s;&s;ent thereunto, and to nominate Per&s;ons of Quality to re|ceive the charge of them, that they &s;hould certify it to both Hou&s;es of Parliament, that thereupon they might expre&s;s their confidence in tho&s;e Per&s;ons, or humbly de&s;ire his Maje&s;ty to name others, none of which Per&s;ons to be removed during three years next en&s;uing, without ju&s;t cau&s;e to be approv'd by both Hou&s;es; and if any &s;hould be &s;o re|mov'd, or die within that &s;pace, the Per&s;ons, to be put in their places, to be &s;uch, as the two Hou&s;es &s;hould Confide in.

that he did not intend, that the Hou&s;es &s;hould expre&s;s their confidence of the Per&s;ons, to who&s;e tru&s;ts tho&s;e places &s;hould be committed, but only that they &s;hould have liberty, upon any ju&s;t exception, to pro|ceed again&s;t any &s;uch Per&s;ons according to Law; his Maje&s;ty being re|&s;olv'd not to protect them again&s;t the publick Ju&s;tice. When any of the places &s;hould be void, he well knew the nomination, and free election of tho&s;e, who &s;hould &s;ucceed, to be a right belonging to, and inherent in his Maje&s;ty; and having been enjoyed by all his Royal Progenitors, he could not believe his well affected Subjects de&s;ired to limit him in that Right; and de&s;ired they would be &s;atisfied with this <MILESTONE N="10"> An&s;wer, or give him any rea&s;ons to alter his re&s;olution, and he would&endq; comply with them.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEY told him, &startq;there could be no good and firm Peace hoped for, if there were not a cure found out for the Fears and Jealou&s;ies; and&endq; they knew none &s;ure, but This which they had propo&s;ed.</Q> <Q>The King replied, &startq;that he rather expected rea&s;ons grounded upon Law, to have &s;hew'd him, by the Law, that he had not that right he pretended, or that they had a right Superior to His, in what was now in que&s;tion; or that they would have &s;hew'd him &s;ome legal rea&s;on, why the Per|&s;ons tru&s;ted by him were incapable of &s;uch a tru&s;t; t$an that they <MILESTONE N="$0"> would only have in&s;i&s;ted upon Fears, and Jealou&s;ies, of which as he knew no ground, &s;o he mu&s;t be ignorant of the cure. That the Ar|gument they u&s;ed might extend to the depriving him of, or at lea&s;t &s;haring with him in, all his ju&s;t regal Power; &s;ince Power, as well as Forces, might be the object of Fears and Jealou&s;ies, and there would be allways a power left to hurt, whil&s;t there was any left to protect and&endq; defend.</Q> <Q>He told them, &startq;if he had as much inclination, as he had more right, to Fears and Jealou&s;ies, he might with more rea&s;on have in&s;i&s;ted upon an addition of power, as a &s;ecurity to enable him to keep his Forts, when he had them; &s;ince it appear'd it was not &s;o great, but <MILESTONE N="$0"> that they had been able to take them from him, than they to make any difficulty to re&s;tore them to him in the &s;ame ca&s;e they were before. But, he &s;aid, as he was him&s;elf content with, &s;o, he took God to Wit|ne&s;s, his greate&s;t de&s;ire was, to ob&s;erve allways and maintain the Law of the Land; and expected the &s;ame from his Subjects; and believ'd the mutual ob&s;ervance of that Rule, and neither of them to fear what the Law fear'd not, to be, on both parts, a better cure for that dan|gerous di&s;ea&s;e of Fears and Jealou&s;ies, and a better means to e&s;tabli&s;h a happy and perpetual Peace, than for him to deve&s;t him&s;elf of tho&s;e tru&s;ts, which the Law of the Land had &s;ettled in the Crown alone, to pre&s;erve the power, and dignity of the Prince, for the better protection of the Subject, and of the Law, and to avoid tho&s;e dangerous di&s;tra|ctions, which the Intere&s;t of any Sharers with him would have infal|libly&endq; produced.</Q></P>
<P>THE Committee neither offer'd to An&s;wer his Maje&s;ties rea&s;ons, nor to oppo&s;e other rea&s;ons to weigh again&s;t them; <Q>but only &s;aid, &startq;That they were commanded by their In&s;tructions, to in&s;i&s;t upon the de&s;ires&endq; of both Hou&s;es formerly expre&s;s'd.</Q> To which the King made no other An&s;wer, <Q>&startq;than that he conceiv'd it all the Ju&s;tice in the world for him to in&s;i&s;t, that what was by Law his own, and had been contrary to Law taken from him, &s;hould be fully re&s;tored to him, without con|ditioning to impo&s;e any new limitations upon Him, or his Mini&s;ters, which were not formerly required from them by the Law; and he

thought it mo&s;t unrea&s;onable, to be pre&s;s'd to dimini&s;h his own ju&s;t&endq; Rights Him&s;elf, becau&s;e Others had violated and u&s;urped them.</Q> This was the Sum of what pa&s;s'd in the Treaty upon that Propo&s;ition.</P>

<P>TO this Me&s;&s;age the two Hou&s;es return'd no An&s;wer to the King, but required the Committee to return to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> (having been in <HI>Oxford</HI> with his Maje&s;ty ju&s;t twenty days) with &s;uch po&s;itive circum|&s;tances, that the Hou&s;e of Commons enjoyn'd Their Members to begin their Journey the &s;ame day; which they obeyed; though it was &s;o late, <MILESTONE N="$0"> that they were forced to very inconvenient Accommodations; and at their return, &s;ome of them were look'd upon with great Jealou&s;y, as Per&s;ons engaged by the King, and di&s;inclined to the Parliament; and this Jealou&s;y prevail'd &s;o far, that M^r <HI>Martin</HI> open'd a Letter from the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> to his own Lady, pre&s;uming he &s;hould therein have di&s;cover'd &s;ome combination; and this in&s;olence was not di&s;liked.</P>
<P>MANY were of opinion, that the King was too &s;evere in this Treaty, and in&s;i&s;ted too much upon what is his own by Right, and Law; and that if he would have di&s;tributed Offices and Places, liberally to parti|cular Men, which had been a conde&s;cen&s;ion in Policy to be &s;ubmitted <MILESTONE N="$0"> to, he might have been repo&s;&s;e&s;s'd of his own Power. And I have heard this alledg'd by many, who at that time were extremely violent again&s;t all &s;uch Artifices. The Committee them&s;elves (who at that time per|fectly
<PB N="175" REF="2090">
abhorred the proceedings of the Parliament, or rather the power, and &s;uperiority of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex)</HI> &s;eem'd exceedingly de&s;irous of &s;uch an accommodation, as all good Men de&s;ired; and to believe, that if the King would have conde&s;cended &s;o far, as to nominate the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> to be Lord High Admiral, that it would have made &s;o great a divi&s;ion in the Hou&s;es, that the Treaty would have been con|tinued, and his Maje&s;ty been &s;atisfied in all the other Propo&s;itions. And the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> to private Friends, did make as full Pro|fe&s;&s;ions of future Service to his Maje&s;ty, and as ample Recognitions of pa&s;s'd Errors, and Mi&s;takes, as could rea&s;onably be expected from a wary Nature, before he could be &s;ure what reception &s;uch Profe&s;&s;ions, and Vows would find. But the King thought the Power and Intere&s;t of that Committee would be able to do little, if it could not prevail for the enlarging the time of the Treaty, in which they &s;eem'd heartily to engage them&s;elves. And he was re&s;olv'd at lea&s;t to have a probable A&s;&s;urance of the conclu&s;ion, before he would offer &s;uch conce&s;&s;ions, as taking no effect might prove prejudicial to him: As particularly, the nominating the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> to be Admiral (though he would willingly have done it, as the price and pledge of a$ Honourable Peace) would have di&s;contented all who had, how unrea&s;o$ably &s;oever, promi&s;ed them&s;elves that preferment; and many would have imputed it to an un&s;ea&s;onable ea&s;ine&s;s (from which imputation it concern'd the King, at that time, as much to purge him&s;elf, as of unmercifulne&s;s and revenge) upon promi&s;es, and hopes, to have readmitted a Man to a charge, and tru&s;t, he had &s;o fatally betrayed, and broken, again&s;t as &s;olemn pro|mi&s;es, and obligations, at the lea&s;t, as he could now enter into; and therefore it concern'd the King to be &s;ure of &s;ome advantage, in lieu of this vi&s;ible hazard.</P>
<P>I AM one of tho&s;e, who do believe, that this obligation, at this time, layed upon the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> with &s;uch other circum&s;tances of kindne&s;s, as would have been fit to accompany it, would have met real gratitude, and faithfulne&s;s in him (for as, originally, he had, I am per&s;waded, no evil purpo&s;es again&s;t the King; &s;o he had now &s;ufficient di&s;dain and indignation again&s;t tho&s;e who got him to tread their Ways, when he had not their Ends) and that it would have made &s;ome rent and divi&s;ion in the two Hou&s;es (which could not but have produced &s;ome benefit to the King) and that it might probably have procured &s;ome few days addition for the continuance of the Treaty; the avow'd ground of denying it, being, becau&s;e the King had not, in the lea&s;t degree, con|&s;ented to any one thing propo&s;ed by them: but, I confe&s;s, I cannot en|tertain any imagination, that it would have produced a Peace, or given the King any advantage, or benefit in the War: what inconvenience it might have produced hath been touch'd before. For, be&s;ides that the &s;tirring and active Party, who carried on the War, were neither gracious to the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> nor He to them, their Favourite at Sea being then the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> who had the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Fleet, and whom alone they believ'd fit to be tru&s;ted with the Navy; who|ever calls to mind, what was done in the Hou&s;es, during the time of the Treaty, and by Their directions; that by their own Authority they directed all the Lands of Bi&s;hops, Deans and Chapters, to be &s;eque&s;ter'd, and inhibited their Tenants to pay any Rent to them; that under pre|$ence of &s;earching for Armes, and taking away &s;uper&s;titious Pictures, they cau&s;ed the Queens Chappel at <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> Hou&s;e (where &s;he was to

<P>WHOSOEVER remembers, the other Propo&s;ition upon which the Treaty was founded, and the Bills then pre&s;ented to the King for his Royal A&s;&s;ent; that there was no unrea&s;onable thing demanded in the nineteen Propo&s;itions, which was not comprehended in the&s;e fourteen, <MILESTONE N="20"> and many additions made that were not in the former; that they de|manded the total abolition and extirpation of Arch-Bi&s;hops, Bi&s;hops, Deans and Chapters, and the whole frame of the Government of the Church; and another Bill for the calling an A&s;&s;embly of Divines, no|minated by them&s;elves (which was a pre&s;umption, as contrary to the Policy and Government of the Kingdom, as the mo&s;t extravagant Act they had done) con&s;i&s;ting of Per&s;ons the mo&s;t deeply engaged in the mo&s;t unwarrantable Acts that had been done; and yet his Maje&s;ty was required to promi&s;e to pa&s;s &s;uch other Bills for &s;ettling of Church Go|vernment, as, upon con&s;ultation with that A&s;&s;embly of Divines, &s;hould <MILESTONE N="30"> be re&s;olv'd on by both Hou&s;es of Parliament: That all the other Bills then pre&s;ented to the King for his Royal A&s;&s;ent, and in&s;i&s;ted on by their fourth Propo&s;ition, though they had &s;pecious and popular Titles, contain'd many Clau&s;es in them contrary to common Equity, and the Right of the Subject, and introduced proceedings very different from the known Ju&s;tice of the Kingdom; and therefore, be&s;ides the time, and circum&s;tances of the pa&s;&s;ing tho&s;e Acts (when the Nation was in blood) not like to meet with his Maje&s;ties Approbation; I &s;ay, who|&s;oever remembers, and con&s;iders all this (to &s;ay nothing of the limita|tions by which their Committee were bound, without any power of de|bating, <MILESTONE N="$0"> or other capacity than to deliver the Re&s;olutions of the two Hou&s;es, and to receive the King's An&s;wer, which might as effectually have been done, by any one &s;ingle ordinary Me&s;&s;enger) cannot, I con|ceive, believe, that the King's con&s;enting to make any one Per&s;on among them High Admiral of <HI>England,</HI> would have been a means to have re|&s;tored the Kingdom to a pre&s;ent Peace, and the King to his ju&s;t Rights and Authority. And if all the&s;e con&s;iderations be not &s;ufficient to ren|der that &s;uppo&s;ition improbable, that, which follows next in order of Story, will abundantly confute it.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Saturday</HI> the 15^t^h of <HI>April,</HI> which was the very day on which the Treaty expired at <HI>Oxford,</HI> being the la&s;t of the twenty days which were fir&s;t a&s;&s;ign'd, and to which no importunity of the Kings could procure an Addition, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> march'd with his whole Army
<PB N="177" REF="2110">
from <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> and &s;ate down before <HI>Reading;</HI> which preparation would <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>marches to Be&s;iege</HI> Reading Apr. 15. <HI>being the la&s;t day of the Treaty.</HI></NOTE> not have been &s;o exactly made, and the re&s;olution &s;o punctually taken, if they had meant any rea&s;onable conce&s;&s;ions from the King &s;hould have fru&s;trated that va&s;t charge, and determin'd all farther Contentions. The Earl had never before been in the head of &s;o gallant an Army, which con&s;i&s;ted of about &s;ixteen thou&s;and Foot, and above three thou&s;and Hor&s;e, in as good an Equipage, and &s;upplied with all things nece&s;&s;ary for a Siege, as could be expected from an Enemy which knew no wants, and had the Command of the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> and all other Stores of the Kingdom. In the Town were above three thou&s;and Foot, and a <MILESTONE N="10"> Regiment of Hor&s;e con&s;i&s;ting of near three hundred; the Fortifications were very mean to endure a form'd Siege, being made only to &s;ecure a Winter Quarter, and never intended for a &s;tanding Garri&s;on. <Q>And it is very true, that it was re&s;olv'd at a Council of War at <HI>Oxford,</HI> &startq;that&endq; before the end of <HI>April</HI></Q> (before which time it was conceiv'd the Ene|my would not adventure to take the Field) <Q>&startq;S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton</HI> &s;hould&endq; &s;light tho&s;e Works, and draw off his Garri&s;on to the $ing;</Q> and that which made it le&s;s able to bear a Siege, than the weakne&s;s of their Works, was their want of Ammunition; for they had not forty Barrels of pow|der; which could have held a brisk and a daring Enemy but a &s;hort <MILESTONE N="20"> time. And as this defect proceeded not from want of fore&s;ight, &s;o it was not capable of being &s;upplied, at lea&s;t in that proportion as was worthy the name of a Supply. For the King had no Port to Friend, by which he could bring Ammunition to <HI>Oxford;</HI> neither had he been yet able to &s;et up any Manufacture for any con&s;iderable &s;upply. So that what he brought up with him after the Battle of <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> which was the re|mainder of the four hundred Barrels brought by the Ship call'd the Pro|vidence, before the &s;etting up of his Standard, had &s;erv'd for all his ex|peditions, being di&s;tributed into the &s;everal Garri&s;ons; and was &s;till to furni&s;h all his growing occa&s;ions; and that Magazine now at <HI>Reading</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> (which was no greater than is before mention'd) was yet double to what was in any other place, <HI>Oxford</HI> only excepted; wherein, at this time, there was not above one hundred Barrels of Powder, and in no one place Match proportionable to that little Powder: And this defect is wholely to be imputed to the lowne&s;s, and &s;treightne&s;s of the Kings condition; for there was no want of indu&s;try, but all imaginable care and pains taken to prevent, and &s;upply it.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the&s;e difficulties, the Town look'd upon the Enemy with Courage and Contempt enough; and to &s;ay the truth, both Officers and Soldiers were as good, as in the infancy of a War <MILESTONE N="$0"> could be expected; and they had no apprehen&s;ion of want of Victual, with which they were abundantly &s;tored. The Soldiers without, were, for the mo&s;t part, newly levied, and few of their Officers acquainted with the way and order of A&s;&s;aulting Towns; and this was the fir&s;t Siege that happen'd in <HI>England.</HI> Upon the fir&s;t &s;itting down before it, after they had taken a full View of the ground, their General advi&s;ed with his Council of War, in what manner he &s;hould proceed, whether by A&s;&s;ault, or Approach; in which there was great diver&s;ity of opinions. <Q>&startq;The Works were weak; the Number of the A&s;&s;ailants &s;ufficient; all materials in readine&s;s; they believ'd the Soldiers in the Town full of Apprehen&s;ions, and a very con&s;iderable Party of the Inhabitants di&s;|affected to the Garri&s;on, who in the time of a Storm would be able to beget a great di&s;traction. They might be able to Storm it in &s;o many
<PB N="178" REF="2120">
places at once, that the number of the Soldiers within would not be able to defend all; and if they prevail'd in any One, their whole Body of Hor&s;e might enter, and be immediately Ma&s;ters of the Town. If they prevail'd this way, their Army would have that Reputation, and carry that terror with it, that no power of the Kings would hereafter be able to abide it; but they might march over the Kingdom, and &s;ubdue every part of it; whereas if they delayed their work, and pro|ceeded by way of Approach, tho&s;e in the Town would recover heart, and after they had dige&s;ted the pre&s;ent Fears, and Apprehen&s;ions, contemn their danger; and their own Soldiers, who were yet fre&s;h <MILESTONE N="10"> and vigorous, would every day abate in Courage, and their Numbers in a few weeks le&s;&s;en as much by &s;ickne&s;s and duty, as they &s;hould&endq; probably do by an A&s;&s;ault.</Q> <Q>On the other hand it was objected, &startq;that&endq; the Army con&s;i&s;ted mo&s;t of new Levies</Q> (and in truth there were not, of all that gallant Army that was at <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> among the Foot, three thou&s;and Men) <Q>&startq;who would be hardly brought to begin upon &s;o de|&s;perate Service; that it was the only Army the Parliament had, upon which all their hopes, and welfare depended; and if, in the Spring, it &s;hould receive an Eminent foil, they would not recover their Courage again all the Summer. That they were not only to look upon the <MILESTONE N="20"> taking of <HI>Reading,</HI> but, pur&s;uing that in a rea&s;onable way, to keep them&s;elves in a po&s;ture and condition to end the War by a Battle with all the King's Forces; which would no doubt apply them&s;elves to their relief; and no place under Heaven could be &s;o commodious for them to try their Fortune in, as That. Whereas if they &s;hould ha&s;tily engage them&s;elves upon an A&s;&s;ault, and receive a Repul&s;e, and &s;hould be afterwards forced to ri&s;e to Fight with the King, they &s;hould never&endq; make their Men &s;tand; and then their Cau&s;e was lo&s;t.</Q> As for the dan|ger of &s;ickne&s;s among the Soldiers, who were not acquainted with hard|&s;hip, it was urged, <Q>&startq;that though it were earlier in the year than the <MILESTONE N="$0"> Armies u&s;ually march'd into the Field, yet they had much better ac|commodation and provi&s;ion than Armies u&s;e to have; their Hor&s;e (to whom that time of the year is commonly mo&s;t hazardous, through the want of Forrage) being plentifully provided for with Hay and Oates by the benefit of the River, and all Supplies being &s;ent for the&endq; Foot out of <HI>London.</HI></Q></P>
<P>AND in truth 'tis hardly credible what va&s;t quantities (be&s;ides the Provi&s;ions made in a very regular way by the Commi&s;&s;ioners) of excel|lent Victual ready dre&s;s'd, were every day &s;ent in Waggons and Carts from <HI>London</HI> to the Army, upon the voluntary contributions from <MILESTONE N="40"> private Families, according to their Affections to the good Work in hand: the Common People being per&s;waded, that the taking of <HI>Reading</HI> would de&s;troy all the King's hopes of an Army; and that it would be taken in very few days. Upon the&s;e Arguments and Debates (in which all the&s;e rea&s;ons were con&s;ider'd on both &s;ides) the Major part of the Council inclined, and with that the General complied, to pur&s;ue the bu&s;ine&s;s by Approach. It was reported, that the Officers of Hor&s;e in the Council were all for a Storm, and the Foot Officers for Approaching. The chief Care and Over&s;ight of the Approaches was committed to <HI>Philip Skippon,</HI> a Man often mention'd in the fir&s;t part of this Hi&s;tory, who had been an old Officer, and of good experience in the low Countries, and was now made Serjeant-Major-General of the Army, by the ab&s;olute power of the two Hou&s;es, and without the chearful concurrence of the Earl of

<P>THE Approaches advanced very fa&s;t, the ground being in all places as fit for that work as could be, and the Town lying &s;o low, that they had ea&s;ily rai&s;ed many Batteries, from whence they &s;hot their Cannon into the Town at a near di&s;tance, but without any con&s;iderable execu|tion; there being fewer lo&s;t by that Service, than will be believ'd, and but one Man of note, Lieutenant Colonel <HI>D'Ews</HI> a young Man of notable Courage, and Vivacity, who had his Leg &s;hot off by a Cannon <MILESTONE N="10"> Bullet, of which he &s;peedily and very chearfully dyed. From the Town there were frequent Sallies with good &s;ucce&s;s; and very many Soldiers, and &s;ome Officers, of the Enemy were kill'd; more, hurt; who were &s;ent to Ho&s;pitals near <HI>London;</HI> and tho&s;e that were &s;ent to <HI>London,</HI> as many Cart Loads were, were brought in the night, and di&s;po&s;ed with great &s;ecrecy, that the Citizens might take no notice of it: the Strata|gems of this kind are too ridiculous to be particularly &s;et down, though pur&s;ued then with great indu&s;try, in&s;omuch as &s;ome were puni&s;h'd for reporting that there were many Soldiers kill'd, and hurt before <HI>Reading;</HI> and it was a mark of Malignity to believe tho&s;e reports, &s;o unfit the Peo|ple <MILESTONE N="20"> were to be tru&s;ted with all truths.</P>
<P>WITHIN a week after the beginning of the Siege, S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton</HI> the Governour, being in a Court of Guard near the Line which was neare&s;t to the Enemies Approaches, a Cannon &s;hot accidentally lighted upon the top of it, which was cover'd with Brick-tyle, a piece whereof, the &s;hot going through, hit the Governour in the head, and made that impre&s;&s;ion upon him, that his &s;en&s;es &s;hortly fail'd him; &s;o that he was not only di&s;abled afterwards from executing in his own Per&s;on, but in|competent for Coun&s;el or Direction; &s;o that the chief Command was devolv'd to Colonel <HI>Richard Fielding,</HI> who was the elde&s;t Colonel of <MILESTONE N="30"> the Garri&s;on. This accident was then thought of great misfortune to the King, for there was not in his Army an Officer of greater Reputa|tion, and of whom the Enemy had a greater dread. The next night af|ter this accident, but before it was known at <HI>Oxford,</HI> a Party from thence under the Command of M^r <HI>Wilmot</HI> the Lieutenant General of the Hor&s;e, without any &s;ignal oppo&s;ition, put in a &s;upply of powder, and a Regiment of five hundred Foot into the Town, and receiv'd Adver|ti&s;ement from thence of the Governours hurt, and that they mu&s;t ex|pect to be reliev'd within a week, beyond which time they &s;hould not be able to hold out. How ill the King was provided for &s;uch an expe|dition, <MILESTONE N="40"> will be&s;t appear by remembering how his Forces were then &s;cat|ter'd, and the pre&s;ent po&s;ture he was then in at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>

<P>IN this po&s;ture Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> now found them, having in the Town with them at that time a Troop of Hor&s;e, belonging to the Garri&s;on of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> which was grown to that &s;trength, that it infe&s;ted tho&s;e parts exceedingly; and would in a &s;hort time have extended it &s;elf to a power|ful juri&s;diction.

<P>IN the Entrance of this Town, and in the too eager pur&s;uit of that loo&s;e Troop of Hor&s;e that was in it, the Earl of <HI>Denbigh</HI> (who from the beginning of the War, with unwearied pains, and exact &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to di&s;cipline and order, had been a Voluntier in Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Troop, and been engaged with &s;ingular Courage in all enterprizes of danger) was unfortunately wounded with many hurts on the Head and Body with Swords, and Poll-Axes; of which, within two or three days, he dyed.

full a qualification was a heightned mea&s;ure of malice and di&s;loyalty for this Service, that it weighed down the infamy of any other leud and vicious behaviour.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Bromicham,</HI> the Prince, without longer &s;tay than to remove two or three &s;light Garri&s;ons in the way, which made very little re&s;i|&s;tance, march'd to <HI>Lichfield,</HI> and ea&s;ily po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of the Town, which lay open to all Comers; but the Clo&s;e (containing the Cathedral Church, and all the Clergy Men's Hou&s;es) was &s;trongly fortified, and re&s;olv'd again&s;t him. The Wall, about which there was a broad and deep Mote, was &s;o thick, and &s;trong, that no Battery the Prince could <MILESTONE N="10"> rai&s;e, would make any impre&s;&s;ion; the Governour, one Colonel <HI>Rou&s;|well,</HI> very re&s;olute, and the Garri&s;on of &s;uch Men as were mo&s;t tran&s;|ported with &s;uper&s;tition to the cau&s;e in which they engaged, and in Number equal to the ground they were to keep, and their provi&s;ions ample for a longer time than it was fit the Prince &s;hould &s;tay before it. So that it was believ'd, when his Highne&s;s had in vain endeavour'd to procure it by Treaty, he would not have engaged before it; for his &s;trength con&s;i&s;ted, upon the matter, wholely in Hor&s;e; his Foot and Dragoons being an incon&s;iderable Force for &s;uch an Attempt. But whe|ther the difficulties were not throughly di&s;cern'd, and weighed at fir&s;t, <MILESTONE N="20"> or whether the importance of the place was thought &s;o great, that it was worth an equal hazard, and adventure, he re&s;olv'd not to move till he had tried the uttermo&s;t; and to that purpo&s;e, drew what addition of Force he could out of the Country, to &s;trengthen his handful of Foot; and per&s;waded many Officers, and Voluntiers of the Hor&s;e to alight, and bear their parts in the duty; with which they chearfully and gal|lantly complied; and in le&s;s than ten days, he had drawn the Mote dry, and prepared two Bridges for the graff. The Be&s;ieged omitted nothing that could be perform'd by vigilant, and bold Men; and killed, and wounded many of the Be&s;iegers; and di&s;appointed, and &s;poiled one Mine <MILESTONE N="30"> they had prepared. In the end, early in the morning, the Prince having prepared all things in readine&s;s for the A&s;&s;ault, he &s;prung another Mine; which &s;ucceeded according to wi&s;h, and made a breach of twenty foot in the Wall, in a place lea&s;t &s;u&s;pected by tho&s;e within; yet they de|fended it with all po&s;&s;ible courage and re&s;olution, and kill'd and hurt very many; &s;ome, Officers of prime quality; whereof the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> Colonel <HI>Gerrard,</HI> Colonel <HI>Wagstaffe,</HI> and Major <HI>Leg</HI> were the chief of the wounded; and when they had enter'd the breach, they continued the di&s;pute &s;o fiercely within (the narrowne&s;s of the breach, and the a&s;cent not &s;uffering many to enter together, and no Hor&s;e being able to <MILESTONE N="40"> get over) that after they had kill'd Colonel <HI>U&s;her,</HI> and &s;ome other good Officers, and taken other Pri&s;oners (for both Colonel <HI>Wagstaffe,</HI> and <HI>William Leg</HI> were in their hands) they compell'd the Prince to con&s;ent to very Honourable conditions; which he readily yeilded to, as think|ing him&s;elf a Gainer by the Bargain. And &s;o the Garri&s;on march'd out <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>and</HI> Lichfield, <HI>and returns to the King.</HI></NOTE> with fair re&s;pect, and the Princes te&s;timony of their having made a cou|ragious Defence; his Highne&s;s being very glad of his conque&s;t, though the purcha&s;e had &s;hrewdly &s;haken his Troops, and robb'd him of many Officers and Soldiers he much Valued. <Q>At this time, either the day be|fore, or the day after this Action, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> receiv'd a po&s;itive Or|der from the King, &startq;to make all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t, with all the &s;trength he had, and all he could draw together from tho&s;e parts, to the relief of&endq; <HI>Reading;</HI></Q> which was in the danger We but now left it.

<P>THE importunity from that Garri&s;on for relief, was &s;o peremptory, and the concernment &s;o great in their pre&s;ervation, that the King found it would not bear the nece&s;&s;ary delay of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s returning with His Forces; and therefore his Maje&s;ty in Per&s;on, with tho&s;e Hor&s;e and <MILESTONE N="10"> Foot which he could &s;peedily draw together, leaving very few behind him in <HI>Oxford,</HI> or in any other Garri&s;on, advanced towards <HI>Reading;</HI> hoping, and that was the utmo&s;t of his hope, that he might with the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Garri&s;on, be able to force one Quarter, and &s;o draw out his Men; and by the advantage of tho&s;e Rivers which divided the Enemy, and by the Pa&s;&s;es, be able to retire to <HI>Oxford;</HI> for being joyn'd, he could not have equalled one half of the Enemies Army. When the King drew near the Town, the day being pa&s;s'd whereon they had been promi&s;ed, or had promi&s;ed them&s;elves relief, he was encounter'd by a Party of the Enemy, which defended their Po&s;t, who being quickly &s;econded by Supplies of Hor&s;e and Foot from all their Quarters, after <MILESTONE N="20"> a very &s;harp conflict, in which many fell on both &s;ides, the King's Party, commanded by the Earl of <HI>Forth</HI> him&s;elf [the General] con&s;i&s;ting of near one thou&s;and Mu&s;queteers, were forced to retire to their Body; which they did the &s;ooner, becau&s;e tho&s;e of the Town made no &s;em|blance of endeavouring to joyn with them; which was that they prin|cipally relyed upon. The rea&s;on of that was, the Garri&s;on, not &s;eeing their relief coming, had &s;ent for a Parley to the Enemy, which was agreed to, with a Truce for &s;o many hours, upon which Ho&s;tages were deliver'd; and a Treaty begun, when the King came to relieve it. Upon the view of the Enemies &s;trength, and intrenchment, all were of opi|nion <MILESTONE N="30"> that the &s;mall Forces of the King would not be able to rai&s;e the Siege, or to joyn with tho&s;e in the Town; and in this Melancholick conclu&s;ion his Maje&s;ty retired for the pre&s;ent, re&s;olving to make any other rea&s;onable attempt the next day. In the mean time, &s;ome Soldiers found means to e&s;cape out of the Town, and Colonel <HI>Fielding</HI> him&s;elf in the Night came to the King, and told him the State they were in; <Q>and &startq;that they were in Treaty, and believ'd he might have very good conditions, and liberty to march away with all their Armes and Bag|gage;&endq;</Q> which was &s;o welcome News, that the King bid him, <Q>Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> being then pre&s;ent, &startq;that if he could procure &s;uch conditions,&endq; he &s;hould accept them:</Q> for indeed the Men and the Armes were all that the King de&s;ired, the lo&s;s of either of which was like to prove fa|tal to him. The King continued &s;till at <HI>Nettlebeck,</HI> a Village &s;even or eight Miles di&s;tant from <HI>Reading,</HI> to attend the &s;ucce&s;s of the Treaty; re&s;olving, if it &s;ucceeded not, to try the utmo&s;t again for their redem|ption; but all Men praying heartily for liberty to march off upon the Treaty, the next day the&s;e Articles were agreed on.</P>

<P>UPON the&s;e Articles, &s;ign'd by the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the Town was de|liver'd on the 27^t^h day of <HI>April</HI> (being within a fortnight after the Siege begun) and the Garri&s;on march'd to the King, who &s;tayed for them, and with him to <HI>Oxford.</HI> But at their coming out of the Town, and pa&s;&s;ing through the Enemies Guards, the Soldiers were not only reviled, and reproachfully u&s;ed, but many of them di&s;arm'd, and mo&s;t of the Waggons plunder'd, in the pre&s;ence of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> him&s;elf, and the Chief Officers; who &s;eem'd to be offended at it, and not to be able to prevent it; the unruline&s;s of the Common Men being &s;o great. As <MILESTONE N="$$"> this breach of the Articles was very notorious, and inexcu&s;able, &s;o it was made the ri&s;e, foundation, and excu&s;e for barbarous inju&s;tice of the &s;ame kind throughout the greate&s;t part of the War; in&s;omuch as the King's Soldiers afterward, when it was Their part to be preci&s;e in the ob&s;ervation of Agreements, mutinou&s;ly remember'd the violation at <HI>Reading;</HI> and thereupon exerci&s;ed the &s;ame Licence; from thence, ei|ther &s;ide having &s;omewhat to object to the other, the requi&s;ite hone&s;ty and ju&s;tice of ob&s;erving conditions was mutually, as it were by agree|ment, for a long time after Violated.</P>
<P>THERE had been, in the &s;ecret Committee for the carrying on the War, forming tho&s;e de&s;igns, and admini&s;tering to the expences thereof, a long debate with great difference of opinion, whether they &s;hould not march directly with their Army to Be&s;iege <HI>Oxford,</HI> where the King and the Court was, rather than <HI>Reading;</HI> and if they had taken that re&s;olu|tion, as M^r <HI>Hambden,</HI> and all they who de&s;ired &s;till to &s;trike at the Root very earne&s;tly in&s;i&s;ted upon, without doubt they had put the King's Af+fairs into great confu&s;ion. For, be&s;ides that <HI>Oxford</HI> was not tolerably Fortified, nor the Garri&s;on well provided for, the Court, and Multi+tude of Nobility, and Ladies, and Gentry, with which it was inhabited bore any kind of Alarm very ill. But others, who did not yet thin$ their Army well enough compo&s;ed to re&s;i&s;t all temptations, nor enough &s;ubdued in their inclinations to Loyalty, and Reverence towards th$ Per&s;on of the King, had no mind it &s;hould Be&s;iege the very place whe$

<P><Q>AT the Trial, it was objected again&s;t the Colonel, &startq;that the Town might have been longer defended, there being want of no nece&s;&s;ary <MILESTONE N="10"> Provi&s;ion, and as much Powder, at the giving it up, as there was when the Enemy came fir&s;t before it; for be&s;ides the fir&s;t &s;upply, &s;ixteen Barrels were put in during the Skirmi&s;h, when the King came to re|lieve it: That &s;everal Colonels pre&s;s'd very earne&s;tly to &s;ally, when the King's Forces were engaged, and that they were expre&s;sly hinder'd, and forbidden by Him: That he frequently gave his Pa&s;s to a Woman to go out of the Town, who went into the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army, and return'd again: That he per&s;waded the Council of War to con&s;ent to the Articles, by prote&s;ting that the King had well approv'd them, and&endq; reproach'd tho&s;e Officers who were of another opinion;</Q> with &s;ome <MILESTONE N="20"> other particulars of Licence and Pa&s;&s;ion, which reflected more upon his Di&s;cretion, than his Hone&s;ty, or Conduct.</P>
<P><Q>HE ju&s;tified him&s;elf &startq;to have done nothing towards the delivery of the place, but upon full con&s;ideration, advice, and approbation of the Council of War: That he was in his own con&s;cience, and judgement &s;atisfied, that the Sub&s;tance of the Articles were advantageous for his Maje&s;ties Service; and though it was true, by that la&s;t &s;upply of Am|munition, their Store was near as much as when the Siege begun; yet it was in all but thirty two Barrels, which would have la&s;ted but few hours, if the Enemy, who had approach'd within little more than <MILESTONE N="30"> Pi&s;tol &s;hot of &s;ome parts of their works, &s;hould attack them in that manner as they had rea&s;on to expect; and if they had held out longer, when it had appear'd that the King was not &s;trong enough to relieve them, they &s;hould not have been admitted to &s;uch conditions: and therefore, that he believ'd a hazard of &s;o great a concernment, was not to be run, when he well knew his Maje&s;ties former re&s;olution of &s;lighting the Garri&s;on; and that it would not be now done above a fortnight &s;ooner than was intended: That he had no knowledge of his Maje&s;ties approach, till the Forces were engaged, when a Truce was concluded, and their Ho&s;tages in the Enemies hands; and therefore, that he conceiv'd it again&s;t the Law of Armes to make any attempt from the Town; and before they could &s;ufficiently deliberate it in Council, his Maje&s;ties Forces retired: That the Woman to whom he gave a Pa&s;s, was one, he often employed as a Spy, with very good effect; and he did believe, the advantage he receiv'd by it, was greater than &s;he could carry to the Enemy by any information &s;he could give: That he did per&s;wade the Council of War to con&s;ent to the conditions, becau&s;e he believ'd them very profitable to his Maje&s;ty, and he had averr'd only his Maje&s;ties Approbation of the general Sub&s;tance of the Articles, never applied it to the Clau&s;e of the third Article, which he much de&s;ired to have alter'd, but could not obtain the con&s;ent of the Enemy.

it proceeded only from his Zeal to the Service, and his apprehen&s;ion of the lo&s;s of &s;o many good Men, upon whom he well knew the King much depended: That he might have committed many Indi&s;cretions, for which he de&s;ired pardon, but had not fail'd in point of Fidelity: That by the unfortunate hurt of the Governour, the Command was devolv'd upon him by his right of Seniority, not any ambitious de|&s;ign of his own: That he had, from time to time, acquainted S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton</HI> with the State, and Condition they were in, and though his in|di&s;po&s;ition of health was &s;uch, that he would not give po&s;itive Orders, he &s;eem'd to approve of all that was done; and though, for the former <MILESTONE N="10"> rea&s;on, he refu&s;ed to &s;ign the Articles, yet they were read to him, and&endq; he expre&s;s'd no di&s;like of them.</Q> The truth of it is, S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton</HI> was believ'd by many, not to be in &s;o incompetent a condition to Com|mand as he pretended; and that albeit his head was &s;o much &s;woln&punc; that he might not in Per&s;on venture upon any execution, yet his under|&s;tanding, or &s;en&s;es, were not much di&s;temper'd, or di&s;compo&s;ed; and that he only po&s;itively waved medling, out of di&s;like of the condition they were in. And it is true, that, when he came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> he could &s;peak as rea&s;onably of any matter, as ever I knew him before, or after.</P>
<P>NOTWITHSTANDING all the defence the Colonel could make for <MILESTONE N="20"> him&s;elf, and that there was not indeed any colour of proof, that he had acted any thing treacherou&s;ly, he was, <Q>upon an Article &startq;for not obey|ing&endq; Orders</Q> (for in this agitation he had receiv'd &s;ome &s;uch, which he had not preci&s;ely ob&s;erv'd) &s;entenced to lo&s;e his head; which judgement, after long and great interce&s;&s;ion, was, in the end, remitted by the King; but his Regiment di&s;po&s;ed to another; and He never re&s;tored to that Command. And though he had been allways before of an unblemi&s;h'd Reputation for Hone&s;ty, and Courage; and had heartily been engaged from the beginning of the Troubles, and been hurt in the Service, and he appear'd afterwards as a Voluntier, with the &s;ame Courage, in the <MILESTONE N="$0"> mo&s;t perilous Actions, and obtain'd a principal Command in another of the King's Armies, he never recover'd the misfortune and blemi&s;h of this Imputation. And yet I mu&s;t profe&s;s for My part, being no &s;tranger to what was then alledg'd, and prov'd on either Party, I do be|lieve him to have been free from any ba&s;e compliance with the Enemy, or any cowardly declen&s;ion of what was rea&s;onable to be attempted. So fatal are all misfortunes, and &s;o difficult a thing it is to play an after-Game of Reputation, in that nice and jealous profe&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE Inconveniences, and Mi&s;chiefs, that re&s;ulted to the King from this accident, were greater than were at that time taken notice of; for from this, the Factions in Court, Army, and City (which afterwards grew very trouble&s;ome to the King) were dated, and took their original; great Animo&s;ities grew between the Officers of the Army; &s;ome being thought to have been too pa&s;&s;ionate, and &s;ollicitous in the pro&s;ecution of the Colonel, and too much to have countenanced the rage and fury of Common Soldiers in demanding Ju&s;tice on their Officer; for from &s;uch a kind of Clamour it begun. Others again were as much condemn'd for a palpable avow'd protection of him, thereby to &s;hew their power, that a Per&s;on They favour'd, &s;hould not &s;uffer; and of both the&s;e, &s;ome were more Violent than they &s;hould have been; which &s;everal Inclina|tions equally po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the Court, &s;ome believing that he was really guilty of Treachery, though not &s;o clearly proved; and therefore that, being within the Mercy of the Law, upon another Article, no mercy ought

to be &s;hew'd to him; others as really &s;uppo&s;ing him Innocent, and there|fore thinking it great pity, &s;everely to take the forfeiture, upon &s;uch a point, as few Officers of the Army did not know Them&s;elves guilty in: the&s;e &s;uppo&s;ing the former too full of rigour, and uncharitablene&s;s; and They again accu&s;ing the Other of too much lenity, and indulgence; whil&s;t many Gentlemen of Honour, and Quality, who&s;e Fortunes were imbarked with the King, grew extremely jealous, that the Parliament had corrupted &s;ome of the King's Officers with rewards; and that others had power to protect them from puni&s;hment, and di&s;covery; and the Soldiers again as much incen&s;ed, that their lives mu&s;t be &s;acrificed, upon <MILESTONE N="10"> Ca&s;ual, and Accidental tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, to the animo&s;ity and jealou&s;y of tho&s;e who run not the &s;ame dangers with them.</P>
<P>BUT the&s;e Indi&s;po&s;itions, and Di&s;tempers, were the effects of the exigents of that time (I wi&s;h the humours had been impaired when the times mended) and very many who &s;aw the King's condition very low in an in&s;tant, and believ'd the Rebels to be mo&s;t flouri&s;hing, would look no farther for a rea&s;on, than the lo&s;s of <HI>Reading;</HI> though they had All &s;till, but the Town; which was never intended to be kept. It is mo&s;t certain, that the King him&s;elf was &s;o far from believing the condition he was in to be tolerable, that, upon the news of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s ad|vance <MILESTONE N="20"> towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> within four or five days after the lo&s;s of <HI>Reading,</HI> he once re&s;olv'd, and that by the advice of the Chief Officers of his Ar|my, to march away towards the North, to joyn with the Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle.</HI> And if the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had, at that time, but made any &s;hew of moving with his whole Body that way, I do verily per&s;wade my &s;elf, <HI>Oxford</HI> it &s;elf, and all the other Garri&s;ons of tho&s;e parts, had been quitted to them; but tho&s;e fears were quickly compo&s;ed, by an A&s;&s;urance of the Earl's &s;tay at <HI>Reading;</HI> and that he was not in a po&s;ture for a pre|&s;ent march, and that his Numbers had been &s;hrewdly le&s;&s;en'd by the Siege; whereupon the King re&s;olv'd to abide him, and give him Battle <MILESTONE N="30"> about <HI>Oxford,</HI> if he advanced; and, in the mean time, encamped his Foot upon the Down, about a Mile from <HI>Abingdon;</HI> which was the head Quarter for his Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>WHEN the Sea&s;on of the year grew ripe for taking the Field, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> found that his too early march had nothing advanced his Affairs; the Soldiers having perform'd &s;o &s;trict duty, and lodging upon the ground, in fro&s;t and rain, before <HI>Reading,</HI> had produced great &s;ick|ne&s;s and di&s;ea&s;es in his Army, which had wa&s;ted abundance of his Men; &s;o that he wanted rather another Winter Quarter to recover, and recruit his Men, than an opportunity to engage them in Action; which he found <MILESTONE N="$$"> would be too often admini&s;ter'd. He &s;ent daily importunities to the Parliament for &s;upplies of all kinds, which they were not enough fur|ni&s;hed with to &s;atisfy him; new Divi&s;ions, and Animo&s;ities aro&s;e There, to perplex their Coun&s;els. Their Triumph upon the taking of <HI>Reading,</HI> which they had celebrated with loud fe&s;tivity, and made the City be|lieve, that all tho&s;e benefits would attend it, which they knew would be mo&s;t grateful to them, appear'd now without any fruit; the King had all his Forces and Army entire, and had only lo&s;t a Town that he never meant to keep, and which They knew not what to do with; and was now ready to come into the Field, when Theirs was de&s;titute of health, and all tho&s;e accommodations, which mu&s;t enable them to march: and their General, every day reiterated his complaints, and reproach'd them with the unskilful Orders they had &s;ent him, by which,

again&s;t all the Advice and Arguments he had given them, he was re|duced to that extremity.</P>
<P>THE di&s;re&s;pectful, and ab&s;urd breaking off the Treaty with the King, was urged by their Commi&s;&s;ioners; who thought them&s;elves di&s;obliged by it, and publi&s;h'd the King's gracious di&s;po&s;ition, and the temper of the Council in <HI>Oxford,</HI> to be different from what the Parliament de|&s;ired it &s;hould be believ'd. They complain'd of jealou&s;ies which had been entertain'd of their Integrity; and the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> having di&s;cover'd, as is &s;aid before, that <HI>Harry Martin</HI> had open'd a Letter, which he had writ from <HI>Oxford</HI> to his Lady, took him a&s;ide, <MILESTONE N="10"> after a conference in the Painted Chamber between the two Hou&s;es, and que&s;tion'd him upon it; and the other giving him &s;ome rude An|&s;wers in ju&s;tification of what he had done, the Earl cudgell'd him in that pre&s;ence; upon which many Swords were drawn, to the great re|proach and &s;candal of the Parliament.</P>
<P>THESE, and the like In&s;tances of di&s;traction, and confu&s;ion, brought the Reputation of that Party low; and made it look'd upon, as like to de&s;troy it &s;elf without an Enemy; whil&s;t the King's Party, at that di|&s;tance, &s;eem'd to be more united, and to have recover'd their Spirits, of which they receiv'd frequent evidence by the News of &s;ome of their <MILESTONE N="20"> Quarters being beat up, and many of their Men lo&s;t by the unexpected incur&s;ions of the King's Hor&s;e; whereof &s;ome Parties, by night marches, and unu&s;ual Lanes, went often near <HI>London,</HI> and took many Pri&s;oners, who thought them&s;elves &s;ecure in their Hou&s;es, and in Journeys they made; who were put to ran&s;ome them&s;elves with good Sums of Mo|ney; &s;o that, after all tho&s;e Mountains of promi&s;es, and undertakings, the wants were greater, and the City more importuned for Money, and the Parliament vi&s;ibly more nece&s;&s;itated for want of it, than they had been before; and in&s;tead of di&s;per&s;ing the King's Army, and bringing the King back to his Parliament, a &s;uddain direction was given, and a <MILESTONE N="30"> vigorous execution of that direction was begun, to draw a Line about the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and to Fortify it; le&s;t the King's Forces might break in upon them; which made the People &s;u&s;pect the State of their Affairs to be wor&s;e than in truth it was; yet &s;o far were they from any thoughts of Peace, and Accommodation, that the Hou&s;e of Commons raged more furiou&s;ly than ever; and every day engaged them&s;elves in conclu&s;ions more mon&s;trous, than they had yet enter'd upon. For the &s;upply of the Charge of the War, they propo&s;ed &s;ettling and impo&s;ing an Exci&s;e upon &s;uch Commodities as might be&s;t bear it; which was a burthen the People of <HI>England</HI> had hitherto reproach'd <MILESTONE N="40"> other Nations with, as a Mark of Slavery, and never fear'd by them|&s;elves; and for the exerci&s;e of the Soveraign Power, they re&s;olv'd it fit to make a new great Seal, to be allways re&s;ident with the Hou&s;es. But the Lords were not yet arriv'd at that pre&s;umption, but plainly refu&s;ed to concur with them in either.</P>

When the ruptures grew &s;o great between the King and the two Hou&s;es, that very many of the Members withdrew from tho&s;e Councils, He, among the re&s;t, with equal di&s;like ab&s;ented him&s;elf; but at the time&punc; the Standard was &s;et up, having intimacy and friend&s;hip with &s;ome Per|&s;ons now of nearne&s;s about the King, with the King's Approbation, he return'd again to <HI>London;</HI> where he &s;poke, upon all occa&s;ions, with great &s;harpne&s;s, and freedom; which (now there were &s;o few there that u&s;ed it, and there was no danger of being over Voted) was not re&s;train'd; and therefore u&s;ed as an Argument again&s;t tho&s;e, <Q>who were gone upon pretence &startq;that they were not &s;uffer'd to declare their opinion freely in the Hou&s;e; which could not be believ'd, when all Men knew, what Liberty M^r <HI>Waller</HI> took, and &s;poke every day with impunity, again&s;t&endq; the Sen&s;e, and Proceedings of the Hou&s;e.</Q> This wone him a great Re|putation with all People who wi&s;h'd well to the King; and he was look'd upon as the bolde&s;t Champion the Crown had in both Hou&s;es; &s;o that &s;uch Lords, and Commons, as really de&s;ired to prevent the ruin of the Kingdom, willingly complied in a great familiarity with him, as a Man re&s;olute in their ends, and be&s;t able to promote them. And it may be they believ'd his Reputation at Court &s;o good, that he would be no ill Evidence There, of other Mens Zeal, and Affection; and &s;o all Men &s;poke their minds freely to him, both of the general di&s;temper, and of the pa&s;&s;ions, and ambition of particular Per&s;ons: All Men knowing him to be of too good a Fortune, and too wary a Nature, to engage him|&s;elf in de&s;igns of danger or hazard.</P>
<P>M^r WALLER had a Brother in Law, one M^r <HI>Tomkins,</HI> who had mar|ried his Si&s;ter, and was Clerk of the Queens Council, of very good fame for Hone&s;ty, and Ability. This Gentleman had good Intere&s;t, and Re|putation in the City, and conver&s;ed much with tho&s;e who di&s;liked the proceedings of the Parliament, and wi&s;h'd to live under the &s;ame Go|vernment they were born; and from tho&s;e Citizens receiv'd informa|tion of the temper of the People, upon Accidents, in the publick Af|fairs. And M^r <HI>Waller,</HI> and He, with that confidence that u&s;es to be be|tween Brethren of the &s;ame good Affections, frequently imparted their <MILESTONE N="$$"> ob&s;ervations, and opinions to each other; the one relating, how many in both Hou&s;es inclined to Peace; and the other making the &s;ame judge|ment upon the corre&s;pondence he had, and intelligence he receiv'd from

the mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Men of <HI>London;</HI> and both of them again commu|nicated what one receiv'd from the other, to the Company they u&s;ed to conver&s;e with; M^r <HI>Waller</HI> imparting the wi&s;hes, and power of the well affected Party in the City, to the Lords and Gentlemen whom he knew to be of the &s;ame mind; and M^r <HI>Tomkins</HI> acquainting tho&s;e he dur&s;t tru&s;t of the City, that &s;uch and &s;uch Lords and Gentlemen, who were of &s;pecial Note, were weary of the di&s;tractions, and would heartily, and confidently contribute to &s;uch an honourable, and hone&s;t Peace, as all Men knew would be mo&s;t acceptable to the King. And from hence they came rea&s;onably to a conclu&s;ion, that if &s;ome means were found <MILESTONE N="10"> out to rai&s;e a confidence in tho&s;e who wi&s;h'd well, that they &s;hould not be oppre&s;s'd by the extravagant power of the de&s;perate Party; but that if they would &s;o far a&s;&s;i&s;t one another, as to declare their opinions to be the &s;ame, they &s;hould be able to prevent, or &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e Tumults, which &s;eem'd to countenance the di&s;tractions; and the Hou&s;es would be induced to Terms of Moderation.</P>
<P>IN this time the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> being return'd from <HI>Ireland,</HI> in|cen&s;ed again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> and di&s;contented with the Parliament here, finding M^r <HI>Waller</HI> in good e&s;teem with the Earl of <HI>No$thumberland,</HI> and of great friend&s;hip with the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> he enter'd into the <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;ame familiarity; and, being more of a Soldier, in the di&s;cour&s;es ad|mini&s;ter'd que&s;tions, and con&s;iderations, nece&s;&s;ary to be under&s;tood by Men that either meant to U&s;e force, or to Re&s;i&s;t it; <Q>and wi&s;h'd &startq;that they who had Intere&s;t, and Acquaintance in the City, would endea|vour by a mutual corre&s;pondence to inform them&s;elves of the di&s;tinct Affections of their Neighbours, that, upon any exigent, Men might&endq; fore&s;ee whom they might tru&s;t;</Q> and the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es being again de|rived by M^r <HI>Waller</HI> to M^r <HI>Tomkins,</HI> He, upon occa&s;ion, and conference with his Companions, in&s;i&s;ted on the &s;ame Arguments; and They again conver&s;ing with Their Friends, and Acquaintance (for of all this bu&s;i|ne&s;s, <MILESTONE N="30"> there were not above three who ever &s;poke together) agreed, <Q>&startq;that &s;ome well affected Per&s;ons, in every Pari&s;h, and Ward, about <HI>London,</HI> &s;hould make a li&s;t of all the Inhabitants; and thereupon to make a&endq; rea&s;onable gue&s;s of their &s;everal Affections (which at that time was no hard thing for ob&s;erving Men to do) and thence a computation of the Strength,</Q> and Power of that Party, which was notoriou&s;ly Violent again&s;t any Accommodation.</P>
<P>I AM per&s;waded the utmo&s;t project in this de&s;ign was (I &s;peak not what particular Men might intend, or wi&s;h upon their own fancies) to beget &s;uch a Combination among the Party well affected, that they <MILESTONE N="40"> would refu&s;e to conform to tho&s;e Ordinances of the twentieth part, and other Taxes for the &s;upport of the War; and thereby, or by joynt Pe|titioning for Peace, and di&s;countenancing the other who Petition'd a|gain&s;t it, to prevail with the Parliament to incline to a determination of the War. And it may be, &s;ome Men might think of making advan|tage of any Ca&s;ual Commotion, or preventing any mi&s;chief by it; and thereupon that enquiry where the Magazines lay, and di&s;cour&s;e of wear|ing &s;ome di&s;tingui&s;hing tokens, had been rather ca&s;ually mention'd, than &s;eriou&s;ly propo&s;ed. For it is certain, very many who were con&s;cious to them&s;elves of Loyal Purpo&s;es to the King, and of hearty di&s;like of the <MILESTONE N="$$"> Parliaments proceedings, and ob&s;erv'd the violent, revengeful, ruinating pro&s;ecution of all Men, by tho&s;e of the engaged Party, were not with|out &s;ad apprehen&s;ions that, upon &s;ome jealou&s;y, and Quarrel pick'd,
<PB N="194" REF="2330">
even a general Ma&s;&s;acre might be attempted of all the King's Friends; and thereupon, in &s;everal di&s;cour&s;es, might touch upon &s;uch expedients, as might in tho&s;e Sea&s;ons be mo&s;t beneficial to their &s;afety. But that there was ever any form'd de&s;ign, either of letting in the King's Army into <HI>London,</HI> which was impo&s;&s;ible to be contriv'd; or of rai&s;ing an Army there, and &s;urpri&s;ing the Parliament, or any one Per&s;on of it, or of u&s;ing any violence in, or upon the City, I could never yet &s;ee cau&s;e to believe; and if there had, they would have publi&s;h'd &s;uch a re|lation of it, after M^r <HI>Waller</HI> had confe&s;s'd to them, all he knew, had heard, or fancied to him&s;elf, as might have con&s;tituted &s;ome rea&s;onable under&s;tanding of it; and not have contented them&s;elves with making <MILESTONE N="10"> conclu&s;ions from Que&s;tions that had been asked, and An&s;wers made, by Per&s;ons unknown, and forcing expre&s;&s;ions u&s;ed by one, to relate to Actions of another, between whom there had been never the lea&s;t ac|quaintance, or corre&s;pondence; and joyning what was Said at <HI>London</HI> to &s;omewhat Done at <HI>Oxford,</HI> at another time, and to another purpo&s;e: for before I fini&s;h this di&s;cour&s;e, it will be nece&s;&s;ary to &s;peak of another Action, which, how di&s;tinct &s;oever from this that is related, was woven together to make one Plot.</P>
<P>FROM the King's coming to <HI>Oxford,</HI> many Citizens of good Quality, who were pro&s;ecuted, or jealou&s;ly look'd upon in <HI>London,</HI> had re&s;orted <MILESTONE N="20"> to the King, and hoping, if the Winter produced not a Peace, that the Summer would carry the King before that City with an Army; <Q>they had entertain'd &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e &startq;of rai&s;ing, upon their own Stocks of Money and Credit, &s;ome Regiments of Foot, and Hor&s;e, and joyning with &s;ome Gentlemen of <HI>Kent,</HI> who were likewi&s;e inclined to &s;uch an&endq; undertaking:</Q> Among the&s;e was S^r <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;p,</HI> a Citizen of good Wealth, great Trade, and an active &s;pirited Man, who had been lately pro&s;ecuted with great &s;everity by the Hou&s;e of Commons, and had thereupon fled from <HI>London,</HI> for appearing too great a Stickler in a Pe|tition <MILESTONE N="30"> for Peace in the City. This Gentleman indu&s;triou&s;ly pre&s;erv'd a corre&s;pondence &s;till there, by which he gave the King often very u&s;eful Intelligence, <Q>and a&s;&s;ured him &startq;of a very con&s;iderable Party, which would appear there for him, when ever his own power &s;hould be &s;o&endq; near, as to give them any countenance.</Q> In the end, whether invited by his Corre&s;pondents there, or tru&s;ting his own &s;prightly inclinations and re&s;olutions too much, and concluding that all who were equally Hone&s;t, would be equally Bold, he de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;to grant a Com|mi&s;&s;ion to &s;uch Per&s;ons, whom He would nominate, of the City of <HI>London,</HI> under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> in the nature of a Commi&s;|&s;ion <MILESTONE N="40"> of Array, by virtue whereof, when the Sea&s;on &s;hould come, his Party there would appear in di&s;cipline, and order; and that this was de&s;ired by tho&s;e, who be&s;t knew what Countenance and Authority was requi&s;ite; and being tru&s;ted to them would not be executed at all, or el&s;e at &s;uch a time as his Maje&s;ty &s;hould receive ample fruit by it; pro|vided it were done with &s;ecrecy, equal to the hazard They &s;hould run,&endq; who were employed in it.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King had this exception to it, &startq;the improbability that it could&endq; do good,</Q> and that the failing might do hurt to the Undertakers. But the Promoter was a very Popular Man in the City, where he had been <MILESTONE N="50"> a Commander of the Train'd-bands, till the Ordinance of the Militia removed him; which rather improv'd, than le&s;&s;en'd, his Credit; and he was very confident, it would produce a notable advantage to the King:
<PB N="195" REF="2340">
however, They de&s;ired it who were there, and would not appear with|out it; and therefore the King con&s;ented to it; referring the nomina|tion of all Per&s;ons in the Commi&s;&s;ion to him; who, he verily believ'd, had proceeded by the In&s;truction, and Advice of tho&s;e that were neare&s;t the concernment; and for the &s;ecrecy of it, the King referr'd the pre|paring, and di&s;patch of the Commi&s;&s;ion, to S^r <HI>Nicholas Cri&s;p</HI> him&s;elf, who &s;hould acquaint no more with it, than he found requi&s;ite; &s;o with|out the privity, or advice of any Coun&s;ellor, or Mini&s;ter of State then mo&s;t tru&s;ted by his Maje&s;ty, he procured &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion as he de|&s;ired (being no other than the Commi&s;&s;ion of Array in <HI>Engli&s;h)</HI> to be <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;ign'd by the King, and &s;ealed with the Great Seal.</P>
<P>THIS being done, and remaining &s;till in his Cu&s;tody, the Lady <HI>Au|bigney,</HI> by a Pa&s;s, and with the con&s;ent of the Hou&s;es, came to <HI>Oxford</HI> to tran&s;act the Affairs of her own Fortune with the King upon the death of her Husband, who was killed at <HI>Edge-hill;</HI> <Q>and She having in few days di&s;patch'd her bu&s;ine&s;s there, and being ready to return, S^r <HI>Nicho|las Cri&s;p</HI> came to the King, and be&s;ought him, &startq;&endq;to de&s;ire that Lady</Q> (who had a Pa&s;s, and &s;o could promi&s;e her &s;elf &s;afety in her Journey) <Q>&startq;&endq; to carry a &s;mall Box (in which that Commi&s;&s;ion &s;hould $e)</Q> <Q>&startq;with her, and to keep it in her own Cu&s;tody, until a Gentleman mould call to&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> her Lady&s;hip for it,</Q> by &s;uch a token; <Q>that token, he &s;aid, &startq;he could &s;end to one of the Per&s;ons tru&s;ted, who &s;hould keep it by him, till&endq; the opportunity came in which it might be executed.</Q> The King ac|cordingly wi&s;h'd the Lady <HI>Aubigney,</HI> to carry it with great care and &s;e|crecy; <Q>telling her, &startq;&endq; it much concern'd his own Service;</Q> and to deliver it in &s;uch manner, and upon &s;uch A&s;&s;urance, as is before mention'd, which &s;he did, and, within few days after her return to <HI>London,</HI> deli|ver'd it to a Per&s;on who was appointed to call for it. How this Com|mi&s;&s;ion was di&s;cover'd, I could never learn: for though M^r <HI>Waller</HI> had the Honour to be admitted often to that Lady, and was believ'd by Her <MILESTONE N="30"> to be a Gentleman of mo&s;t entire Affections to the King's Service, and con&s;equently might be fitly tru&s;ted with what &s;he knew, yet her Lady|&s;hip her &s;elf, not knowing what it was &s;he carried, could not inform any Body el&s;e.</P>
<P>BUT about this time, a Servant of M^r <HI>Tomkins,</HI> who had often cur|&s;orily over heard his Ma&s;ter and M^r <HI>Waller</HI> di&s;cour&s;e of the Argument, We are now upon, placed him&s;elf behind a hanging, at a time they were together; and there, whil&s;t either of them di&s;cour&s;ed the language, and opinion of the Company they kept, over heard enough to make him believe his Information, and Di&s;covery, would make him welcome to <MILESTONE N="40"> tho&s;e whom he thought concern'd; and &s;o went to M^r <HI>Pym,</HI> and ac|quainted him with all he had heard, or probably imagined. The time when M^r <HI>Pym</HI> was made acquainted with it, is not known; but the cir|cum&s;tances of the publi&s;hing it were &s;uch, as filled all Men with Ap|prehen&s;ions. It was on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the 31^&s;^t of <HI>May,</HI> their &s;olemn fa&s;t day, when, being all at their Sermon, in S^t <HI>Margarets</HI> Church in <HI>We&s;t|min&s;ter,</HI> according to their cu&s;tom, a Letter or Me&s;&s;age is brought pri|vately to M^r <HI>Pym;</HI> who thereupon, with &s;ome of the mo&s;t active Mem|bers, ri&s;e from their Seates; and, after a little whi&s;pering together, re|move out of the Church: This could not but exceedingly affect tho&s;e <MILESTONE N="$$"> who &s;tayed behind; immediately they &s;end Guards to all the Pri&s;ons, as <HI>Lambeth-</HI>Hou&s;e, <HI>Ely-</HI>Hou&s;e, and &s;uch places, where their Malignants were in Cu&s;tody, <Q>with directions &startq;&endq; to &s;earch the Pri&s;oners;</Q> and &s;ome
<PB N="196" REF="2350">
other places which they thought fit &s;hould be &s;u&s;pected. <Q>After the Ser|mons were ended, the Hou&s;es met; and were only then told, &startq;that Letters were intercepted going to the King and the Court at <HI>Oxford,</HI> that expre&s;s'd &s;ome notable Con&s;piracy in hand, to deliver up the Par|liament, and the City into the hands of the Cavaliers; and that the&endq; time for the execution of it, drew very near.</Q> <Q>Hereupon a Committee was appointed &startq;to examine all Per&s;ons They thought fit; and to appre|hend&endq; &s;ome nominated at that time.</Q> And the &s;ame Night, this Com|mittee apprehended M^r <HI>Waller,</HI> and M^r <HI>Tomkins;</HI> and, the next day, &s;uch others as they &s;u&s;pected. <MILESTONE N="1$"></P>
<P>M^r WALLER was &s;o confounded with Fear, and Apprehen&s;ion, that he confe&s;s'd whatever he had &s;aid, heard, thought, or &s;een; all that he knew of him&s;elf, and all that he &s;u&s;pected of others; without conceal|ing any Per&s;on of what Degree, or Quality &s;oever, or any di&s;cour&s;e that he had ever, upon any occa&s;ion, entertain'd with them: What &s;uch and &s;uch Ladys of great Honour, to whom, upon the Credit of his great Wit, and very good Reputation, he had been admitted, had &s;poke to him in their Chambers of the proceedings in the Hou&s;es; and how they had encouraged him to oppo&s;e them, what corre&s;pondence, and inter|cour&s;e they had, with &s;ome Mini&s;ters of State at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and how they <MILESTONE N="20"> deriv'd all Intelligence thither. <Q>He inform'd them, &startq;that the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> had been particular in all the agita|tions which had been with the Citizens; and had given frequent Ad|vice, and Directions, how they &s;hould demean them&s;elves; and that the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> had expre&s;s'd very good wi&s;hes to any attempt, that might give a &s;top to the Violent Actions, and Proceed|ings&endq; of the Hou&s;es, and produce a good Under&s;tanding with the King.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the Committee were thus furni&s;h'd, they took the examina|tions of M^r <HI>Tomkins,</HI> and &s;uch other as they thought nece&s;&s;ary, and having at the &s;ame time, by &s;ome other means, di&s;cover'd (or conceal'd <MILESTONE N="30"> it till this time) that Commi&s;&s;ion which is before di&s;cour&s;ed of, and gotten the very Original into their hands, they kneaded both into one Plot, and Con&s;piracy; and, acquainting the Hou&s;es with &s;o much as they thought yet &s;ea&s;onable to publi&s;h, they declared (without naming any Lords, or other Per&s;ons, to be intere&s;&s;ed in the de&s;ign, &s;ave tho&s;e only who were impri&s;on'd; among whom the Lady <HI>Aubigney</HI> was one: and without communicating any of the examinations, which, they pretended, were not to be common till the Con&s;pirators were brought to Tryal) <Q>&startq;that the Original of this Con&s;piracy was from the late <HI>London</HI> Petition&endq; for Peace,</Q> which was &s;poken of about <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> la&s;t in the Book pre|cedent; <MILESTONE N="40"> <Q>&startq;and that, under pretence of Peace and Moderation, a Party was to be form'd, which &s;hould be able to &s;uppre&s;s all opponents, and to awe the Parliament: That, to this purpo&s;e, &s;ome of tho&s;e who were the principal Movers, and Fomenters of that Petition, did con|tinue, in the Nature of a Committee, &s;till to carry on the de&s;ign: that they held Intelligence in both Armies, Court, and Parliament; took a general Survey of the Numbers, and Affections of the &s;everal Inha|bitants throughout the Wards, and Pari&s;hes of the City, and places adjacent; and di&s;tingui&s;h'd all under the titles of Men affected, or aver&s;e to the King; or indifferent, and Neutral Per&s;ons, carried only by the <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;ucce&s;s, and power of the Prevailers: That they were well in&s;tructed in the Number, and inclinations of the Train'd-bands of <HI>London;</HI> the places where the Magazines were kept; where the Commanders for

<P><Q>&startq;WHEREAS there hath been, and now is, in this Kingdom, a Popi&s;h, and Trayterous Plot for the Subver&s;ion of the true Prote&s;tant Re|form'd Religion, and the Liberty of the Subject; and, in pur&s;uance thereof, a Popi&s;h Army hath been rai&s;ed, and is now on foot in divers parts of this Kingdom; and whereas there hath been a treacherous and horrid de&s;ign, lately di&s;cover'd by the great ble&s;&s;ing and e&s;pecial <MILESTONE N="20"> providence of God, of divers Per&s;ons, to joyn them&s;elves with the Armies rai&s;ed by the King, and to de&s;troy the Forces rai&s;ed by the Lords and Commons in Parliament, to &s;urpri&s;e the Cities of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> with the Suburbs; by Armes to force the Parliament; and finding by con&s;tant experience, that many ways of force, and trea|chery, are continually attempted, to bring to utter ruin and de&s;truction the Parliament, and Kingdom; and that which is deare&s;t, the true Pro|te&s;tant Religion: And that, for the preventing and with&s;tanding the &s;ame, it is fit, that all, who are true hearted, and lovers of their Coun|try, &s;hould bind them&s;elves each to other in a &s;acred Vow and Co|venant:&endq;</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P><Q>&startq;I <HI>A.

<P>THOUGH many were much &s;tartled at this Covenant, and took time <MILESTONE N="10"> to con&s;ider of it, there being in the Preamble, and po&s;itive part, much which very few believ'd, and in the promi&s;&s;ory part a more direct de|nouncing War again&s;t the King, than had been in plain terms before avow'd by them, and an ab&s;olute Prote&s;tation again&s;t Peace, till the King were at their Mercy; yet the fear of being concluded guilty of the Plot, made them &s;wallow all the re&s;t; and the example of one prevail|ing with many, there was not a Member of either Hou&s;e that took it not; and being thus fetter'd, and intangled them&s;elves, they &s;ent their Committee into the City, <Q>to acquaint them with their &startq;happy di&s;co|very, <MILESTONE N="20"> and how miraculou&s;ly God had pre&s;erv'd them, and to engage&endq; them in the &s;ame &s;acred Vow, and Covenant;</Q> which was readily &s;ub|mitted <NOTE PLACE="marg">The &s;ame Vow and Cove|nant taken throughout the City, and Army.</NOTE> to; and, by the Indu&s;try of their Clergy, &s;ooner than can be imagined, taken throughout that People.

<P>THERE is nothing clearer than that the Commi&s;&s;ion &s;ent from <HI>Ox|ford</HI> <MILESTONE N="$$"> by the Lady <HI>Aubigney,</HI> had not any relation to the di&s;cour&s;es pa&s;s'd between M^r <HI>Waller, Tomkins,</HI> and tho&s;e Citizens, or that they, who knew of one, had not any privity with the other: which if they had had,

and intended &s;uch an In&s;urrection, as was alledged, M^r <HI>Waller,</HI> and M^r <HI>Tomkins,</HI> or &s;ome one of tho&s;e Lords who were &s;uppo&s;ed to combine with them, would have been in the Commi&s;&s;ion. Or if the King's Mi|ni&s;ters had been engaged in the con&s;ultation, and hoped to have rai&s;ed a Party which &s;hould &s;uddainly &s;ei&s;e upon the City, and the Parliament, they would never have thought a Commi&s;&s;ion granted to &s;ome Gentle|men at <HI>Oxford</HI> (for the Major part of the Commi&s;&s;ioners were there and a few private Citizens, would have &s;erv'd for that work. I am very confident, and I have very much rea&s;on for that confidence, that there was no more known, or thought of at <HI>Oxford,</HI> concerning the matter of the Commi&s;&s;ion, than I have before &s;et forth, nor of the other, than that M^r <HI>Tomkins</HI> &s;ometimes writ to the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> (for M^r <HI>Waller,</HI> out of the cautiou&s;ne&s;s of his own Nature, never writ word) and by Me&s;&s;engers &s;ignified to him, <Q>&startq;that the Number of tho&s;e, who de&s;ired Peace, and adhorr'd the proceedings of the Hou&s;es, was very con&s;i|derable; and that they re&s;olv'd, by refu&s;ing to contribute to the War, and to &s;ubmit to their Ordinances, to declare and manife&s;t them&s;elves in that manner, that the Violent Party in the City &s;hould not have&endq; credit enough to hinder any Accommodation.</Q> <Q>And the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> allways return'd An&s;wer, &startq;that they &s;hould expedite tho&s;e Expedients, a&s;&s;oon as might be, for that delays made the War more difficult to be&endq; re&s;train'd.</Q> And if I could find Evidence, or Rea&s;on, to induce me to believe, that there was any farther de&s;ign in the thing it &s;elf, or that the King gave farther countenance to it, I &s;hould not at all conceal it. No Man can imagine, that if the King could have entertain'd any pro|bable hope of reducing <HI>London,</HI> which was the Fomenter, Supporter, and indeed the Life of the War, or could have found any expedient, from whence he could rea&s;onably propo&s;e to di&s;&s;olve, &s;catter, and di&s;|per&s;e tho&s;e who, under the name of a Parliament, had kindled a War again&s;t him, but he would have given his utmo&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and coun|tenance thereunto, either by publick Force, or private Contrivance.</P>
<P>THERE were very great endeavours u&s;ed, to have proceeded with equal &s;everity again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Conway</HI> (for the accu&s;ation of the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> it was proceeded ten|derly in; for though the Violent Party was heartily incen&s;ed again&s;t him, as a Man weary of them, yet his Reputation was &s;till very great) who were both clo&s;e Pri&s;oners; and, to that purpo&s;e, their Lord&s;hips and M^r <HI>Waller</HI> were confronted before the Committee; where They as peremptorily denying, as He charging them, and there being no other Witne&s;s but He again&s;t them, the pro&s;ecution was rather let alone than declined, till after a long re&s;traint they procured enlargement upon Bayl. M^r <HI>Waller</HI> him&s;elf (though confe&s;&s;edly the mo&s;t guilty; and by his unhappy demeanour, in this time of his Affliction, he had rai&s;ed as many Enemies as he had formerly Friends, and allmo&s;t the &s;ame) after he had, with incredible di&s;&s;imulation, acted &s;uch a remor&s;e of Con|&s;cience, that his Tryal was put off out of Chri&s;tian compa&s;&s;ion, till he might recover his under&s;tanding (and that was not, till the heat, and fury of the Pro&s;ecutors, was rea&s;onably abated with the Sacrifices they had made) and, by drawing Vi&s;itants to him&s;elf, of the mo&s;t powerful Mi|ni&s;ters of all Factions, had, by his liberality, and penitence, his receiving vulgar and vile &s;ayings from them with humility, and reverence, as clearer Convictions and Informations than in his Life he had ever had; and di&s;tributing great Sums to them for their Prayers, and Gho&s;tly

Coun&s;el; &s;o &s;atisfied Them, that They &s;atisfied others; was brought, at his &s;uite, to the Hou&s;e of Commons Bar; where (being a Man in truth very powerful in Language; and who, by What he &s;poke, and in the Manner of &s;peaking it, exceedingly captivated the good Will and Benevolence of his hearers; which is the highe&s;t part of an Oratour) with &s;uch flattery, as was mo&s;t exactly calculated to that Meridian, with &s;uch a Submi&s;&s;ion, as Their Pride took delight in, and &s;uch dejection of mind, and &s;pirit, as was like to cou&s;en the Major part, and be thought &s;erious; <Q>he laid before them &startq;their own danger, and concernment, if they &s;hould &s;uffer one of their own Body, how unworthy and mon|&s;trous <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;oever, to be tryed by the Soldiers, who might thereby grow to that power hereafter, that they would both try tho&s;e, They would not be willing &s;hould be tryed, and for things, which they would ac|count No Crimes; the inconvenience, and in&s;upportable mi&s;chief whereof, all wi&s;e Common-wealths had fore&s;een, and prevented, by&endq; exempting their own Members from all judgements but their own:</Q> He prevailed, Not to be tryed by a Council of War; and thereby pre|&s;erv'd his dear bought Life; &s;o that, in truth, he does as much owe the Keeping his head to that Oration, as <HI>Cataline</HI> did the $o&s;s of His to tho&s;e of <HI>Tully:</HI> and by having done Ill very well, he, by degrees, drew <MILESTONE N="20"> that re&s;pect to his parts, which allways carries &s;ome compa&s;&s;ion to the Per&s;on, that he got leave to compound for his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, and them to accept of ten thou&s;and pounds (which their Affairs wanted) for his liberty; whereupon he had leave to recollect him&s;elf in another Coun|try (for his Liberty was to be in Bani&s;hment) how mi&s;erable he had made him&s;elf, in obtaining that leave to live out of his own. And there cannot be a greater Evidence of the ine&s;timable Value of his Parts, than that he liv'd, after this, in the good Affection, and E&s;teem of many, the pity of mo&s;t, and the reproach, and &s;corn of few, or none.</P>
<P>THESE high proceedings, at <HI>London,</HI> and in the Hou&s;es, were not <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;econded with any notable &s;ucce&s;s abroad; but it appear'd plainly, by the &s;low coming in of Monies, and more &s;low coming in of Men, that the hearts of the People were generally more devoted to Peace, than to the continuance of tho&s;e di&s;tractions; and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> by the great decay, and &s;ickne&s;s of his Army, was not in near &s;ix weeks, able to remove from <HI>Reading;</HI> by which many Men concluded, which could not be rea&s;onably fore&s;een, that if <HI>Reading</HI> had held out many days longer, he would have been compell'd to rai&s;e his Siege; and that was the rea&s;on the Earl gave for granting &s;o good conditions: for if he could have &s;tayed longer before it, he well knew, they mu&s;t have yeilded on <MILESTONE N="$0"> wor&s;e terms; neither feared he the King would be able to relieve it. In the end, there being no other way to quiet the City of <HI>London,</HI> he march'd towards <HI>Oxford;</HI> but, in truth, rather to &s;ecure <HI>Buckingham|&s;hire,</HI> which was now infe&s;ted by the King's Hor&s;e, than to di&s;quiet that place. And to that purpo&s;e, he fixed his head Quarter at <HI>Thame,</HI> ten <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>marches to</HI> Thame.</NOTE> Miles from <HI>Oxford,</HI> and upon the very edge of the other Country.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the War, the Army in <HI>Scotland</HI> having been lately disbanded, many Officers of that Nation, who had &s;erv'd in <HI>Ger|many</HI> and in <HI>France,</HI> betook them&s;elves to the Service of the Parlia|ment; whereof divers were Men of good Conduct, and Courage; though there were more as bad as the Cau&s;e, in which they engaged. Of the former &s;ort Colonel <HI>Hurry</HI> was a Man of Name, and Reputation, and an excellent Officer of Hor&s;e, and had commanded tho&s;e Hor&s;e at

<HI>Edge-hill</HI> under <HI>Balfour,</HI> which had pre&s;erv'd their Army there; and finding him&s;elf afterwards not &s;o well regarded, as, he thought, he had de&s;erv'd, as it was no ea&s;y thing to value that People at the rate they did &s;et upon them&s;elves; and being without any other Affection for their Service, than their Pay inclined him to, he re&s;olv'd to quit them, and to go to the King; in order to which, he had kept &s;ome corre&s;pondence with the Earl of <HI>Brainford</HI> the King's General; under who&s;e Command he had formerly &s;erv'd in <HI>Germany.</HI> Whil&s;t the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> remain'd at <HI>Thame,</HI> and his Army quarter'd thereabout, <HI>Hurry</HI> came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> in the Equipage that became a Colonel of Hor&s;e who had receiv'd good <MILESTONE N="10"> Pay; and the very next day after he came, having been very graciou&s;ly receiv'd by the King, to give proof that he brought his whole heart with him, he went to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> acquainted him where the Parliament Hor&s;e lay, and how loo&s;e they were in their Quarters; and to give a te&s;timony of his fidelity to the King, he de&s;ired to march a Voluntier with a good Party, to make an attempt upon the Enemy; and the Prince a&s;&s;igning a &s;trong Party for the Service, he accompanied, and conducted them out of the Common Road, till they came to a Town, where a Re|giment of the Parliaments Hor&s;e was Quarter'd; which they beat up; and killed, or took mo&s;t of the Officers and Soldiers; and then fell upon <MILESTONE N="20"> tho&s;e other Quarters, by which they had pa&s;&s;ed before, with the like &s;ucce&s;s; &s;o return'd to <HI>Oxford</HI> with many Pri&s;oners, and with notable damage to the Enemy.</P>
<P>ASSOON as he return'd, he made another propo&s;ition to the Prince for the attacking the Quarters near <HI>Thame;</HI> through which he had pa&s;s'd, when he came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and &s;o was well acquainted with the po&s;ture in which they were, and a&s;&s;ured the Prince, <Q>&startq;that, if he went about it time enough, before there &s;hould be any alteration in their Quarters, which he believ'd the General would quickly make, the Enterpri&s;e&endq; would be worthy of it.</Q> The Prince was &s;o well &s;atisfied with what he <MILESTONE N="30"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Rupert <HI>beates up &s;ome of his Quar|ters with good &s;ucce&s;s.</HI></NOTE> had already done, that he re&s;olv'd to conduct the next adventure him|&s;elf, which he did very fortunately. They went out of the Ports of <HI>Ox|ford</HI> in the Evening upon a <HI>Saturday,</HI> and march'd beyond all the Quar|ters as far as <HI>Wickham,</HI> and fell in there at the farther end of the Town towards <HI>London,</HI> from whence no Enemy was expected, and &s;o no Guards were kept There. A Regiment of Hor&s;e, and of Foot, were lodged there; which were cut off, or taken Pri&s;oners; and all the Hor&s;es and a good Booty brought away. From thence they march'd backward to another Quarter, within le&s;s than two Miles of the General's own Quarters; where his Men lodged with the &s;ame &s;ecurity, they had done <MILESTONE N="40"> at <HI>Wickham,</HI> not expecting any Enemy that way; and &s;o met with the &s;ame fate the others had done; and were all kill'd, or made Pri&s;oners. Thus having perform'd, at lea&s;t as much as they had propo&s;ed to do, and being laden with Pri&s;oners, and Booty, and the Sun being now ri&s;ing, the Prince thought it time to retire to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and gave orders to march accordingly with all convenient &s;peed, till they &s;hould come to a Bridge which was yet two Miles from them, where he had appointed a Guard to attend, to favour their Retreat.</P>
<P>BUT the Alarm had been brought to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> from all the Quarters, who quickly gathered tho&s;e Troops together, which were neare&s;t; and directed tho&s;e to follow the Prince, and to entertain him in Skirmi&s;hes, till Him&s;elf &s;hould come up with the Foot, and &s;ome other Troops; which he made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t to do. So that when the

Prince had allmo&s;t pa&s;s'd a fair Plain, or Field, call'd <HI>Chalgrave</HI> Field, from whence he was to enter a Lane, which continued to the Bridge; the Enemies Hor&s;e were di&s;cover'd marching after them with &s;peed; and as they might ea&s;ily overtake them in the Lane, &s;o they mu&s;t as ea&s;ily have put them into great di&s;order. Therefore the Prince re&s;olv'd to expect, and &s;tand them upon the open Field, though his Hor&s;e were all tired, and the Sun was grown very hot, it being about eight of the Clock in the Morning in <HI>June.</HI> <Q>He then directed, &startq;that the Guard of the Pri&s;oners &s;hould make what ha&s;t they could to the Bridge, but that&endq; all the re&s;t &s;hould return;</Q> for &s;ome were enter'd the Lane: and &s;o he <MILESTONE N="10"> placed him&s;elf and his Troops, as he thought fit, in that Field to receive the Enemy; which made more ha&s;t, and with le&s;s order than they &s;hould have done; and being more in Number than the Prince, and con&s;i&s;ting of many of the Principal Officers, who having been pre&s;ent with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> when the Alarm came, &s;tayed not for their own Troops, but joyn'd with tho&s;e who were ready in the pur&s;uit, as They thought, of a Flying Enemy, or &s;uch as would ea&s;ily be arre&s;ted in their ha&s;ty re|treat; and, having now overtaken them, meant to take revenge them|&s;elves for the damage they had receiv'd that Night, and Morning, be|fore the General could come up to have a &s;hare in the Victory, though <MILESTONE N="20"> his Troops were even in View. But the Prince entertain'd them &s;o roughly, that though they charged very bravely and ob&s;tinately, being many of their be&s;t Officers, of which the chiefe&s;t falling, the re&s;t &s;hew'd le&s;s Vigour, in a &s;hort time they broke, and fled, and were pur&s;ued till they came near the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Body; which being at near a miles di&s;tance, and making a &s;tand to receive their Flying Troops, and to be inform'd of their di&s;a&s;ter, the Prince with his Troops ha&s;ten'd his retreat, and pa&s;s'd the Lane, and came &s;afe to the Bridge before any of the Earls Forces came up; who found it then to no purpo&s;e to go farther, there being a good Guard of Foot, which had likewi&s;e lined both &s;ides of the <MILESTONE N="30"> Hedges a good way in the Lane. Thus the Prince, about Noon, or &s;hort|ly after, enter'd <HI>Oxford,</HI> with near two hundred Pri&s;oners, &s;even Cor|nets of Hor&s;e, and four En&s;igns of Foot, with mo&s;t of the Men he car|ried from thence; few only having been kill'd in the Action, whereof &s;ome were of Name.</P>
<P>THE Prince pre&s;ented Colonel <HI>Hurry</HI> to the King with a great Te&s;ti|mony of the Courage he had &s;hew'd in the Action, as well as of his Coun|&s;el, and Conduct in the whole; which was indeed very dexterous, and could have been perform'd by no Man, who had not been very con|ver&s;ant in the Quarters of tho&s;e he de&s;troyed. Upon which, the King <MILESTONE N="$0"> honour'd him with Knighthood, and a Commi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e a Regiment of Hor&s;e; and every body magnified, and extolled him, as they u&s;ually do a Man who hath good luck, and the more, becau&s;e he was a <HI>Scotch|man,</HI> and profe&s;s'd a Repentance for having been in Rebellion again&s;t the King. <Q>He de&s;erves this Te&s;timony, and Vindication to be given him, again&s;t the calumnies which were rai&s;ed again&s;t him, &startq;as if he had broken his Tru&s;t, and de&s;erted the Service of the Parliament, and betrayed&endq; them to the King, which is not true.</Q> He had own'd, and publi&s;h'd his di&s;contents long before, and demanded redre&s;s, and ju&s;tice, in &s;ome par|ticulars from the Parliament, in which the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> thought he had rea&s;on; and wi&s;h'd he might receive &s;atisfaction. But the Man was in his nature proud, and imperious; had rai&s;ed many Enemies; was a Man of Licence, and committed many di&s;orders of that kind. He was
<PB N="204" REF="2430">
however a good Officer in the Field; regular and vigilant in marching, and in his Quarters; which the Parliament thought other Men would attain to, who had fewer Vices; and therefore granted nothing that he had de&s;ired; <Q>upon which he declared, &startq;&endq; he would &s;erve them no longer; and deliver'd up his Commi&s;&s;ion to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI></Q> and being then pre&s;s'd to promi&s;e, that he would not &s;erve the King; he po&s;itively re|fu&s;ed to give any &s;uch Engagement; and after he had &s;tayed in <HI>London</HI> about a Month, and had receiv'd encouragement from &s;ome Friends in <HI>Oxford,</HI> he came thither in the manner &s;et down before.</P>
<P>THE Prince's &s;ucce&s;s in this la&s;t march was very &s;ea&s;onable, and rai&s;ed <MILESTONE N="10"> the Spirits at <HI>Oxford</HI> very much, and for &s;ome time allayed the Jealou|&s;ies, and Animo&s;ities, which too often broke out in &s;everal Factions to the di&s;quiet of the King. It was vi&s;ibly great in the number of the Pri|&s;oners; whereof many were of condition, and the names of many Offi|cers were known, who were left dead upon the Field, as Colonel <HI>Gunter,</HI> who was look'd upon as the be&s;t Officer of Hor&s;e they had, and a Man of known malice to the Government of the Church; which had drawn &s;ome &s;evere cen&s;ure upon him before the Troubles, and for which he had &s;till meditated Revenge. <Q>One of the Pri&s;oners taken in the Action, &s;aid, &startq;that he was confident M^r <HI>Hambden</HI> was hurt, for he &s;aw him <MILESTONE N="20"> ride off the Field before the Action was done, which he never u&s;ed to do, with his head hanging down, and re&s;ting his hands upon the neck&endq; of his Hor&s;e;</Q> by which he concluded he was hurt. The news the next day made the Victory much more important, than it was thought to have been. There was full information brought of the great lo&s;s the Enemy had &s;u&s;tain'd in their Quarters, by which three or four Regi|ments were utterly broken and lo&s;t: the names of many Officers, of the be&s;t account, were known, who were either kill'd upon the place, or &s;o hurt as there remain'd little hope of their recovery.</P>
<P>AMONG the Pri&s;oners, there were taken Colonel <HI>Sheffield,</HI> a younger <MILESTONE N="30"> Son of the Earl of <HI>Mulgrave,</HI> and one Colonel <HI>Beckly</HI> a <HI>Scotch-</HI>man; who, being both vi&s;ibly wounded, acted their hurts &s;o well, and pre|tended to be &s;o ready to expire, that upon their Paroles neither to en|deavour nor endure a Re&s;cue, they were &s;uffer'd to re&s;t at a private Hou&s;e in the way, within a mile of the Field, till their Wounds &s;hould be dre&s;s'd, and they recover &s;o much &s;trength as to be able to render them&s;elves Pri&s;oners at <HI>Oxford.</HI> But the King's Forces were no &s;ooner gone, than they found means to &s;end to their Comrades, and were the next day &s;trong enough, to &s;uffer them&s;elves to be removed to <HI>Thame,</HI> by a &s;trong Party &s;ent from the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and, between denying <MILESTONE N="$$"> that they had promi&s;ed, and &s;aying, that they would perform it, they never &s;ubmitted them&s;elves to be Pri&s;oners, as much again&s;t the Law of Armes, as their taking Armes was again&s;t their Allegiance. But that which would have been look'd upon as a con&s;iderable recompence for a Defeat, could not but be thought a great addition to the Victory, which was the death of M^r <HI>Hambden;</HI> who, being &s;hot into the Shoulder with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Hambden <HI>wounded in</HI> Chalgrave <HI>Field, of which he died.</HI></NOTE> a brace of Bullets, which brake the Bone, within three Weeks after died with extraordinary pain; to as great a con&s;ternation of all that Party, as if their whole Army had been defeated, or cut off.</P>
<P>MANY Men ob&s;erv'd (as upon &s;ignal turns of great Affairs, as this was, &s;uch ob&s;ervations are frequently made) that the Field in which the late Skirmi&s;h was, and upon which M^r <HI>Hambden</HI> receiv'd his deaths wound, <HI>Chalgrave</HI> Field, was the &s;ame place in which he had fir&s;t executed

the Ordinance of the Militia, and engaged that County, in which his Reputation was very great, in this Rebellion: and it was confe&s;s'd by the Pri&s;oners that were taken that day, and acknowledged by all, that upon the Alarm that morning, after their Quarters were beaten up, he was exceeding &s;ollicitous to draw Forces together to pur&s;ue the Enemy; and, being a Colonel of Foot, put him&s;elf among tho&s;e Hor&s;e as a Vo|luntier, who were fir&s;t ready; and that when the Prince made a &s;tand, all the Officers were of opinion to &s;tay till their Body came up, and He alone (being &s;econd to None but the General him&s;elf in the ob&s;ervance, and application of all Men) per&s;waded, and prevailed with them to ad|vance; <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;o violently did his fate carry him, to pay the Mulct in the place where he had committed the Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ion, about a year before.</P>
<P>HE was a Gentleman of a good Family in <HI>Buckingham-&s;hire,</HI> and born to a fair Fortune, and of a mo&s;t civil and affable deportment. In his entrance into the world, he indulged to him&s;elf all the Licence in Sports and Exerci&s;es, and Company, which were u&s;ed by Men of the mo&s;t Jolly Conver&s;ation. Afterwards, he retired to a more re&s;erv'd, and Melan|choly Society, yet pre&s;erving his own natural Chearfulne&s;s, and Viva|city, and above all, a flowing courte&s;y to all Men; though they who conver&s;ed nearly with him, found him growing into a di&s;like of the Ec|cle&s;ia&s;tical <MILESTONE N="20"> Government of the Church, yet mo&s;t believ'd it rather a di&s;|like of &s;ome Church-men, and of &s;ome introducements of Theirs, which he apprehended might di&s;quiet the publick Peace. He was rather of Reputation in his own Country, than of publick di&s;cour&s;e, or fame in the Kingdom, before the bu&s;ine&s;s of Ship-money: but Then he grew the Argument of all Tongues, every Man enquiring who, and what He was, that dur&s;t, at his own charge, &s;upport the Liberty, and Property of the Kingdom, and re&s;cue his Country, as he thought, from being made a Prey to the Court. His carriage, throughout this Agitation, was with that rare temper and mode&s;ty, that they who watch'd him <MILESTONE N="30"> narrowly to find &s;ome advantage again&s;t his Per&s;on, to make him le&s;s re&s;olute in his Cau&s;e, were compell'd to give him a ju&s;t Te&s;timony. And the Judgement that was given again&s;t him, infinitely more advanced Him, than the Service for which it was given. When this Parliament begun (being return'd Knight of the Shire for the County where he liv'd) the Eyes of all Men were fixed upon him, as their <HI>Patriae Pater,</HI> and the Pilot that mu&s;t &s;teer the Ve&s;&s;el, through the Tempe&s;ts, and Rocks which threaten'd it. And I am per&s;waded, his Power and Intere&s;t, at that time, was greater to do Good or Hurt, than any Man's in the King|dom, or than any Man of His Rank hath had in any time: for his Re|putation <MILESTONE N="40"> of Hone&s;ty was Univer&s;al, and his Affections &s;eem'd &s;o publick|ly guided, that no corrupt, or private ends could bya&s;s them.</P>
<P>HE was of that rare affability, and temper in Debate, and of that &s;eeming humility and &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion of judgement, as if he brought no opinion of his own with him, but a de&s;ire of Information, and In&s;tru|ction; yet he had &s;o &s;ubtle a way of Interrogating, and, under the no|tion of Doubts, in&s;inuating his Objections, that he infu&s;ed his own opi|nions into tho&s;e from whom he pretended to learn, and receive them. And even with them who were able to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from his in|fu&s;ions, and di&s;cern'd tho&s;e opinions to be fixed in him, with which they could not comply, he allways left the Character of an Ingenious, and Con&s;cientious Per&s;on. He was indeed a very Wi&s;e Man, and of great parts, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd with the mo&s;t ab&s;olute &s;pirit of Popularity, and the
<PB N="206" REF="2460">
mo&s;t ab&s;olute faculties to govern the People, of any Man I ever knew. For the fir&s;t year of the Parliament, he &s;eem'd rather to moderate, and &s;often the violent and di&s;temper'd humours, than to inflame them. But wi&s;e and di&s;pa&s;&s;ion'd Men plainly di&s;cern'd, that that moderation pro|ceeded from prudence, and ob&s;ervation that the &s;ea&s;on was not ripe, rather than that he approv'd of the moderation; and that he Begot many opinions, and motions, the Education whereof he committed to other Men; &s;o far di&s;gui&s;ing his own de&s;igns, that he &s;eem'd &s;eldom to wi&s;h more than was concluded; and in many gro&s;s conclu&s;ions, which would hereafter contribute to de&s;igns not yet &s;et on foot, when he <MILESTONE N="10"> found them &s;ufficiently backed by majority of Voices, he would with|draw him&s;elf before the Que&s;tion, that he might &s;eem not to con&s;ent to &s;o much vi&s;ible unrea&s;onablene&s;s; which produced as great a doubt in &s;ome, as it did approbation in others, of his Integrity. What com|bination &s;oever had been originally with the <HI>Scots</HI> for the Inva&s;ion of <HI>England,</HI> and what farther was enter'd into afterwards in favour of them, and to advance any alteration of the Government in Parliament, no Man doubts was at lea&s;t with the privity of this Gentleman.</P>
<P>AFTER he was among tho&s;e Members accu&s;ed by the King of High-Trea&s;on, he was much alter'd; his nature and carriage &s;eeming much <MILESTONE N="20"> fiercer than it did before. And without que&s;tion, when he fir&s;t drew his Sword, he threw away the Scabbard; for he pa&s;&s;ionately oppo&s;ed the Overture made by the King for a Treaty from <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and as eminently, all expedients that might have produced any accommoda|tions in this that was at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and was principally relied on, to pre|vent any infu&s;ions which might be made into the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> towards Peace, or to render them ineffectual, if they were made; and was in|deed much more relied on by that Party, than the General him&s;elf. In the fir&s;t entrance into the Troubles, he undertook the Command of a Regiment of Foot, and perform'd the duty of a Colonel, upon all oc|ca&s;ions, <MILESTONE N="30"> mo&s;t punctually. He was very temperate in diet, and a Supreme Governour over all his Pa&s;&s;ions, and Affections, and had thereby a great power over other Mens. He was of an Indu&s;try and Vigilance not to be tired out, or wearied by the mo&s;t Laborious; and of Parts not to be impo&s;ed upon, by the mo&s;t Subtle, or Sharp; and of a Per&s;onal cou|rage equal to his be&s;t Parts; &s;o that he was an Enemy not to be wi&s;h'd wherever he might have been made a Friend; and as much to be ap|prehended where he was &s;o, as any Man could de&s;erve to be. And there|fore his death was no le&s;s plea&s;ing to the One Party, than it was condoled in the Other. In a word, what was &s;aid of <HI>Cinna,</HI> might well be ap|plied <MILESTONE N="40"> to Him; <Q>&startq;he had a Head to contrive, and a Tongue to per&s;wade,&endq; and a Hand to execute, any mi&s;chief.</Q> His death therefore &s;eem'd to be a great deliverance to the Nation.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army was &s;o weaken'd by the&s;e defeates, and more by the &s;ickne&s;s that had wa&s;ted it, that it was not thought &s;afe to remain longer &s;o near his unquiet, and re&s;tle&s;s Enemies. The Factions, and Animo&s;ities at <HI>London,</HI> required his pre&s;ence There; and he thought the Army would be &s;ooner recruited there, than at &s;o great a di&s;tance; &s;o that he march'd directly from <HI>Thame</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> where he found <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>marches from</HI> Thame <HI>to</HI> London; <HI>quartering his Army about S^t</HI> Albans.</NOTE> Jealou&s;y and Contention enough; leaving his Army Quarter'd about S^t <HI>Albans.</HI> Whil&s;t the Affairs of the Parliament were in this di&s;traction, the King's recover'd great Reputation; and the Sea&s;on of the year being fit for Action, all Di&s;contents, and Factious Murmurings, were adjourn'd to the next Winter.</P>

THE end of the Treaty, in which We left the Chief Commanders <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Affairs in the We&s;t.</NOTE> of the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Forces, with Commi&s;&s;ioners of the other We&s;tern Coun|ties, was like that in other places; for notwith&s;tanding tho&s;e extraor|dinary obligations of Oaths, and receiving the Sacrament, circum&s;tances in no other Treaty, the Parliament no &s;ooner &s;ent their Votes, and De|clarations to them (the &s;ame which are before mention'd upon the Trea|ties in <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Che&s;hire)</HI> and &s;ome Members of their own to overlook and perplex them, but all peaceable Inclinations were laid a&s;ide; &s;o that (having in the mean time indu&s;triou&s;ly levied Money, through|out <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> and <HI>Devon,</HI> upon Friends and Enemies; and a good Body <MILESTONE N="10"> of Men) the Night before the expiration of the Treaty and Ce&s;&s;ation, <HI>James Chudleigh</HI> the Major General of the Rebels, brought a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e and Foot within two miles of <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> the head Quarter of the <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> and the very next Morning, the Ce&s;&s;ation not being determined till after twelve of the Clock in the Night, march'd upon the Town, where they were not &s;ufficiently provided for them. For though the Commanders of the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> had employed their time, as u&s;efully as they could, during the Ce&s;&s;ation, in preparing the Gentry of that Country, and all the Inhabitants, to &s;ubmit to a Weekly Tax for the &s;upport of that power, which defended them; over and above <MILESTONE N="20"> which, the Gentlemen, and Per&s;ons of Quality, freely brought in all their Plate to be di&s;po&s;ed of to the publick; and though they fore&s;aw, after the Committee of Parliament came into the Country, that the Treaty would conclude without fruit, and therefore S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> and S^r <HI>Bevil Greenvil</HI> repaired to <HI>Launce&s;ton</HI> the day before the expira|tion of the Treaty, to meet any attempt &s;hould be made upon them: Yet, being to Feed, and Pay their &s;mall Forces out of one County, they had been compell'd to Quarter their Men at a great di&s;tance, that no one part might be more oppre&s;s'd than was nece&s;&s;ary: &s;o that all that was done the fir&s;t day, was by the advantage of Pa&s;&s;es, and lining of <MILESTONE N="30"> Hedges, to keep the Enemy in Action, till the other Forces came up; which they &s;ea&s;onably did, towards the Evening; and then the Enemy, who receiv'd great lo&s;s in that days Action, grew &s;o heartle&s;s, that in the Night they retired to <HI>Okington,</HI> fifteen miles from the place of their Skirmi&s;h. After which many &s;mall Skirmi&s;hes en&s;ued, for many days, with various &s;ucce&s;s; &s;ometimes the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> advancing in <HI>Devon,</HI> and then retiring again; for it appear'd now, that a form'd Army was march|ing again&s;t them, &s;o far &s;uperior in Number, that there was no rea|&s;onable hope of re&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the middle of <HI>May,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Stamford</HI> march'd into <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Stamford <HI>marches into</HI> Cornwal <HI>with an Army.</HI></NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Cornwal,</HI> by the North part, with a Body of fourteen hundred Hor&s;e and Dragoons, and five thou&s;and four hundred Foot by the Poll, with a Train of thirteen Bra&s;s Ordnance, and a Mortar Piece, and a very plentiful Magazine of Victual, and Ammunition, and every way in as good an Equipage, as could be provided by Men who wanted no Mo|ney; whil&s;t the King's &s;mall Forces, being not half the Number, and un&s;upplied with every u&s;eful thing, were at <HI>Launce&s;ton;</HI> of whom the Enemy had &s;o ab&s;olute a contempt, though they knew they were march|ing to them, within &s;ix or &s;even Miles, that they con&s;ider'd only how to take them after they were di&s;per&s;ed, and to prevent their running <MILESTONE N="50"> into <HI>Pendennis</HI> Ca&s;tle to give them farther trouble. To which purpo&s;e having encamped them&s;elves upon the flat top of a very high Hill, to which the A&s;cents were very &s;teep every way, near <HI>Stratton,</HI> being the

This de&s;ign, which was not in it &s;elf unrea&s;onable, proved fortunate to the King. For his Forces which march'd from <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> with a re&s;olution to Fight with the Enemy, upon any di&s;advantage of Place or Number (which, how hazardous &s;o|ever, <MILESTONE N="10"> carried le&s;s danger with it, than retiring into the County, or any thing el&s;e that was in their power) ea&s;ily now re&s;olv'd to A&s;&s;ault the Camp in the ab&s;ence of their Hor&s;e; and with this re&s;olution, they march'd on <HI>Monday</HI> the fifteenth of <HI>May,</HI> within a Mile of the Enemy; being &s;o de&s;titute of all Provi&s;ions, that the be&s;t Officers had but a Bisket a Man a day, for two days, the Enemy looking upon them as their own.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Tue&s;day</HI> the &s;ixteenth of <HI>May,</HI> about five of the Clock in the Morning, they di&s;po&s;ed them&s;elves to their Work; having &s;tood in their Armes all the Night. The Number of Foot was about two thou&s;and <MILESTONE N="20"> four hundred, which they divided into four Parts, and agreed on their &s;everal Provinces. The fir&s;t was Commanded by the Lord <HI>Mohun,</HI> and S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton;</HI> who undertook to A&s;&s;ault the Camp on the South &s;ide.

<P>IN this manner the Fight begun; the King's Forces pre&s;&s;ing, with their utmo&s;t vigour, tho&s;e four ways up the Hill, and the Enemies as ob&s;tinately defending their ground. The Fight continued with very doubtful &s;ucce&s;s, till towards three of the Clock in the Afternoon; when word was brought to the Chief Officers of the <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> that their Am|munition was &s;pent to le&s;s than four Barrels of Powder; which (con|cealing the defect from the Soldiers) they re&s;olv'd could be only &s;up|plied with Courage: and therefore, by Me&s;&s;engers to one another, they agreed to advance with their full Bodies, without making any more &s;hot, till they reach'd the top of the Hill, and &s;o might be upon even ground with the Enemy; wherein the Officer's Courage, and Re&s;olution, was &s;o well &s;econded by the Soldier, that they begun to get ground in all places; and the Enemy, in wonder of the Men, who out faced their &s;hot with their Swords, to quit their Po&s;t.

Then the Enemy gave ground apace, in&s;omuch as the four Parties, growing nearer and nearer as they a&s;cended the Hill, be|tween three and four of the Clock, they all met together upon one ground near the top of the Hill; where they embraced with un&s;peakable joy, each congratulating the others &s;ucce&s;s, and all acknowledging the wonderful ble&s;&s;ing of God; and being there po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of &s;ome of the Enemies Cannon, they turn'd them upon the Camp, and advanced to|gether <MILESTONE N="10"> to perfect the Victory.

On the Parliament &s;ide, notwith&s;tanding their advantage of ground, and that the other were the A&s;&s;ailants, above three hundred were &s;lain on the place, and &s;even|teen hundred taken Pri&s;oners with their Major General, and above thirty other Officers. They took likewi&s;e all their Baggage and Tents, <MILESTONE N="$0"> all their Cannon, being, as was &s;aid before, thirteen pieces of Bra&s;s Ordnance, and a Bra&s;s Mortar piece; all their Ammunition, being &s;e|venty Barrels of Powder, and all other &s;orts of Ammunition propor|tionable, and a very great Magazine of Bisket, and other excellent pro|vi&s;ions of Victuals; which was as &s;ea&s;onable a Ble&s;&s;ing as the Victory, to tho&s;e who, for three or four days before, had &s;uffer'd great want of food as well as &s;leep; and were equally tired with duty, and hunger.

<P>THE truth is, he was of too good an under&s;tanding, and too much genero&s;ity in his nature, to be affected to the Cau&s;e which he &s;erv'd, or <MILESTONE N="4$"> to comply with tho&s;e Arts, which he &s;aw practiced to carry it on; and having a Command in <HI>Ireland</HI> when the War fir&s;t broke out, he came thence into <HI>England,</HI> with a purpo&s;e to &s;erve the King; and to that end, &s;hortly after his Maje&s;ties coming to <HI>Oxford,</HI> he came thither to ten|der his Service; but he found the Eyes of mo&s;t Men fixed upon him with prejudice and jealou&s;y there, both for his Family's &s;ake, which was notoriou&s;ly di&s;affected to the King, and for &s;ome errors of his own, in that Plot, that was &s;o much &s;poken of, to bring up the Northern Army to awe the Parliament; in which bu&s;ine&s;s, being then a very young Man, and of a &s;tirring &s;pirit, and de&s;irous of a Name, he had expre&s;s'd much Zeal to the King's Service, and been bu&s;y in inclining the Army to en|gage in &s;uch Petitions, and Undertakings, as were not gracious to the Parliament.

When the Marquis was ready for his Journey, news arriv'd of the great Victory at <HI>Stratton;</HI> &s;o that there was no dan|ger <MILESTONE N="10"> in the Marquis's being able to joyn with that little <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Army; and then there would appear indeed a vi&s;ible Body worthy the name of an Army. This put &s;ome Per&s;ons upon de&s;iring, that Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> (who was yet in no other Quality of Command, than of a private Colo|nel of Hor&s;e, but had allways behaved him&s;elf with great Courage and Vigilance) might be likewi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed into a Command of that Army. Hereupon the King a&s;&s;ign'd Him, and his Highne&s;s willingly accepted to be Lieutenant General under the Marquis; who for many rea&s;ons, be&s;ides that he was actually po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of it, was thought fit to have the &s;uperior power over tho&s;e We&s;tern Counties, where his Fortune lay, <MILESTONE N="20"> and the E&s;timation, and Reverence of the People to him was very great. So the Prince, and the Marquis, with Prince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s, and the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon</HI>'s, and Colonel <HI>Thomas Howard</HI>'s Regiments of Hor&s;e (the Earl being General of the Cavalry) advanced into the We&s;t; and &s;taying only &s;ome few days at <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and after in <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> whil&s;t &s;ome new Regiments of Hor&s;e and Foot, which were levying by the Gentlemen in tho&s;e parts, came up to them, made all convenient ha&s;t into <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> being de&s;irous to joyn with the <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> a&s;&s;oon as might be; pre&s;uming they &s;hould be then be&s;t able to perfect their new Levies, when they were out of apprehen&s;ion of being di&s;turbed by a <MILESTONE N="$$"> more powerful Force. For S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> was already march'd out of <HI>London,</HI> and u&s;ed not to &s;tay longer by the way than was unavoidably nece&s;&s;ary.</P>
<P>IN the Marquis's fir&s;t entrance into the We&s;t, He had an un&s;peakable lo&s;s, and the King's Service a far greater, by the death of M^r <HI>Rogers,</HI> a Gentleman of a rare Temper, and excellent Under&s;tanding; who be|&s;ides that he had a great Intere&s;t in the Marquis, being his Cou&s;in-german, and &s;o, out of that private Relation, as well as Zeal to the publick, pa&s;|&s;ionately inclined to advance the Service, had a wonderful great in|fluence upon the County of <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> for which he &s;erv'd as one of the Knights in Parliament; and had &s;o well de&s;ign'd all things there, that <HI>Poole,</HI> and <HI>Lyme</HI> (two Port Towns in that County, which gave the King afterwards much Trouble) if He had liv'd, had been undoubtedly re|duced. But by his Death all tho&s;e hopes were cancelled, the &s;urviving Gentry of that Shire being, how well affected &s;oever, &s;o unactive, tha$ the progre&s;s, that was that year made there to the King's advantage ow'd little to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of <HI>June,</HI> Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and the Marquis, with &s;ixteen or &s;eventeen hundred Hor&s;e, and about one thou&s;and new levie$ Foot, and &s;even or eight Field-pieces, came to <HI>Chard,</HI> a fair Town i$ <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> neare&s;t the edge of <HI>Devon-&s;hire;</HI> where, according t$ order, they were met by the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Army; which con&s;i&s;ted of abov$ three thou&s;and excellent Foot, five hundred Hor&s;e, and three hundre$

Yet if the ex|traordinary temper and virtue of the Chief Officers of the <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> had not been much &s;uperior to that of their Common Soldiers, who valued them&s;elves high, as the Men who&s;e courage had alone vindicated the King's Cau&s;e in the We&s;t, there might have been greater di&s;order at their fir&s;t joyning, than could ea&s;ily have been compo&s;ed. For how &s;mall <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;oever the Marquis's Party was in Numbers, it was &s;upplied with all the General Officers of a Royal Army, a General, Lieutenant General, General of the Hor&s;e, General of the Ordnance, a Major General of Hor&s;e, and another of Foot, without keeping &s;uitable Commands for tho&s;e who had done all that was pa&s;&s;ed, and were to be principally re|lied on for what was to come. So that the Chief Officers of the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Army, by joyning with a much le&s;s Party than them&s;elves, were at be&s;t in the condition of Private Colonels. Yet the &s;ame Publick thoughts &s;till &s;o ab&s;olutely prevailed with them, that they quie$ed all murmur|ings and emulations among Inferior Officers, and Common Soldiers; <MILESTONE N="20"> and were, with equal candour and e&s;timation, valued by the Prince and Marquis, who bethought them&s;elves of all expedients, which might prevent any future mi&s;under&s;tanding.</P>
<P>TAUNTON was the fir&s;t place they re&s;olv'd to vi&s;it, being one of the faire&s;t, large&s;t, and riche&s;t Towns in <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire;</HI> but withall as emi|nently affected to the Parliament, where they had now a Garri&s;on; but they had not yet the &s;ame Courage they recover'd afterwards. For the Army was no &s;ooner drawn near the Town, the head Quarters being at <HI>Orchard;</HI> a Hou&s;e of the <HI>Portmans,</HI> two miles from the Town, but the Town &s;ent two of their &s;ub&s;tantial Inhabitants to Treat; which, though <MILESTONE N="30"> nothing was concluded, &s;truck that terror into the Garri&s;on (the Pri|&s;oners in the Ca&s;tle, whereof many were Men of good Fortunes, im|pri&s;on'd there as Malignants, at the &s;ame time rai&s;ing &s;ome commotion there) that the Garri&s;on fled out of the Town to <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> being a le&s;s Town but of a much &s;tronger &s;ituation; and, with the &s;ame panick fear, the next day, from thence; &s;o that the Marquis was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd, in three days, of <HI>Taunton, Bridgewater,</HI> and <HI>Dun&s;tar-</HI>Ca&s;tle, &s;o much &s;tronger than both the other, that it could not have been forced; yet by the dexterity of <HI>Francis Windham,</HI> who wrought upon the fears of the owner, and ma&s;ter of it, M^r <HI>Lutterel,</HI> was, with as little blood &s;hed <MILESTONE N="$0"> as the other, deliver'd up to the King; into which the Marquis put him, that took it, as Governour; as he well de&s;erv'd.</P>
<P>THE Government of <HI>Taunton</HI> he committed to S^r <HI>John Stawell,</HI> a Gentleman of a very great E&s;tate in tho&s;e parts; who, from the be|ginning, had heartily and per&s;onally engaged Him&s;elf and his Children for the King; and was in the fir&s;t form of tho&s;e who had made them|&s;elves obnoxious to the Parliament. The other Government, of <HI>Bridge|water,</HI> was conferr'd upon <HI>Edmund Windham,</HI> High Sheriff of the County, being a Gentleman of a Fortune near the place, and of a good per&s;onal Courage, and unque&s;tionable Affection to the Cau&s;e.

<PB N="214" REF="2540">
they had with the Country. For whereas the Chief Commanders of the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Army, had re&s;train'd their Soldiers from all manner of Licence, obliging them to &s;olemn, and frequent Actions of Devotion, in&s;omuch as the fame of their Religion, and Di&s;cipline, was no le&s;s than of their Courage, and thereupon S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> (who was generally con&s;ider'd as the General of that Army, though it was govern'd by &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion as is before remember'd) was greedily expected in his own Country, where his Reputation was &s;econd to no Mans; the Hor&s;e, that came now with the Marquis, having lived under a loo&s;e di&s;cipline, and coming now into plentiful Quarters, unvi&s;ited by an Army, eminent for their di&s;affection, were di&s;orderly enough to give the Enemy credit in laying more to their charge than they de&s;erv'd; and by their Licence hinder'd tho&s;e orderly Levies, which &s;hould have brought in a &s;upply of Money, for the regular payment of the Army. This extravagancy produced another mi&s;chief, &s;ome jealou&s;y, or &s;hadow of it, between the Lord Marquis and Prince <HI>Maurice;</HI> the fir&s;t, as being better ver&s;ed in the policy of Peace, than in the my&s;teries of War, de&s;iring to regu|late the Soldier, and to re&s;train him from u&s;ing any Licence upon the Country, and the Prince being thought &s;o wholely to incline to the Sol|dier, that he neglected any con&s;ideration of the Country, and not with|out &s;ome de&s;ign of drawing the &s;ole dependence of the Soldier upon him&s;elf. But here were the &s;eeds rather &s;own of di&s;like, than any vi&s;i|ble di&s;inclination produced; for after they had &s;ettled the Garri&s;ons be|fore mention'd, they advanced, with unity and alacrity, Ea&s;tward, to find out the Enemy, which was gathered together in a con&s;iderable Body, within le&s;s than twenty miles of them.</P>
<P>WHILST &s;o much time was &s;pent at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to prepare the &s;up|plies for the We&s;t, and in &s;ettling the manner of &s;ending them; which might have been done much &s;ooner, and with le&s;s noi&s;e; the Parliament fore&s;aw, that if all the We&s;t were recover'd from them, their Quarters would by degrees be &s;o &s;treighten'd, that their other Friends would quickly grow weary of them. They had &s;till all the We&s;tern Ports at their Devotion, tho&s;e in <HI>Cornwal</HI> only excepted; and their Fleets had allways great benefit by it. And though mo&s;t of the Gentry were en|gaged again&s;t them, as they were in truth in many parts throughout the Kingdom, yet the Common People, e&s;pecially in the Cloathing parts of <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> were generally too much inclined to them. So that they could not want Men, if they &s;ent a Body of Hor&s;e, and &s;ome Armes, to countenance them; with the la&s;t of which, they had &s;uffi|ciently &s;tored the Sea Towns which were in their hands. And there|fore they re&s;olv'd, that though they could not ea&s;ily recruit their Army, they would &s;end &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e, and Dragoons, into the We&s;t, to keep up the Spirits of their Friends there.

So that <MILESTONE N="20"> he got great Reputation with the Parliament and the City; and was there called <HI>William the Conqueror.</HI> And it is very true, that they who looked upon the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> as a Man that would not keep them company to the end of their Journey, had their Eyes upon S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> as a Man more for Their turn; and were de&s;irous to extol him the more, that he might eclip&s;e the other. And therefore they pre|pared all things for his march, with &s;o great expedition, and &s;ecrecy, that the Marquis of <HI>Hertford</HI> was no &s;ooner joyn'd to the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Troops (in which time <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> and <HI>Dun&s;tar,</HI> and &s;ome other places were reduced from the Parliament) before he was inform'd that S^r <HI>William</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Waller</HI> was within two days march of him, and was more like to draw &s;upplies to him from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and the parts adjacent, which were under the Parliament, than the Marquis could from the open Country; and therefore it was held mo&s;t coun&s;elable to advance, and engage him, whil&s;t he was not yet too &s;trong; and by this means they &s;hould con|tinue &s;till their march towards <HI>Oxford;</HI> which they were now inclined to do.</P>
<P>THOUGH S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> him&s;elf continued &s;till at <HI>Bath,</HI> yet the remainder of tho&s;e Hor&s;e and Dragoons that e&s;caped out of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> after the Battle of <HI>Stratton,</HI> and &s;uch other as were &s;ent out of <HI>Exeter</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> for their ea&s;e, when they apprehended a Siege, and tho&s;e Soldiers who fled out of <HI>Taunton,</HI> and <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> and other Regiments of the Country, were by <HI>Alexander Popham, Strode,</HI> and the other Deputy Lieutenants of the Militia for <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> rallied; and with the Train'd|bands, and Voluntier Regiments of the Country, drawn together, with that confidence, that when the Marquis had taken up his head Quarters at <HI>Somerton,</HI> the Enemy, before break of day, fell upon a Regiment of Dragoons, quarter'd a mile Ea&s;tward from the Town; and gave &s;o brisk an Alarm to the King's Army, that it was immediately drawn out, and advanced upon the Enemy (being the fir&s;t they had &s;een make any <MILESTONE N="$0"> &s;tand before them, &s;ince the Battle of <HI>Stratton)</HI> who making &s;tands upon the places of advantage, and maintaining little Skirmi&s;hes in the Rear, retired in no ill order to <HI>Wells;</HI> and the King's Forces &s;till pur&s;uing,

they cho&s;e to quit that City likewi&s;e; and drew their whole Body, ap|pearing in number as con&s;iderable as their Pur&s;uers, to the top of a Hill, called <HI>Mendip-</HI>Hill, overlooking the City of <HI>Wells,</HI> which they had left. The day being far &s;pent, and the March having been long, the Marquis, with all the Foot, and Train, &s;tayed at <HI>Wells;</HI> but Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon,</HI> with S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> and S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> and two Regiments of Hor&s;e, re&s;olv'd to look upon the Enemy on the top of the Hill; who &s;uffer'd them, without interruption, to gain the top of the Hill level with them, and then, in a very orderly manner, facing with a large Front of their Hor&s;e, to give their Foot and Baggage lei&s;ure <MILESTONE N="$$"> and &s;ecurity, retired together as the Prince advanced. This, and the natural contempt the King's Hor&s;e yet had of the Enemy, which in all Skirmi&s;hes and Charges had been hitherto beaten by them, made the Prince judge this to be but a more graceful running away; and there|fore follow'd them farther, over tho&s;e large Hills, till the Enemy, who were anon to pa&s;s through a Lane, and a Village called <HI>Chewton,</HI> were compelled, before their entrance into the Lane, to leave their Re&s;erve; which faced about much thinner than it was over the Hill; which op|portunity and advantage was no &s;ooner di&s;cern'd, as it had been fore&s;een, but the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon</HI> (who allways Charged home) with an incom|parable <MILESTONE N="$$"> Gallantry Charged the Enemy, and pre&s;s'd them &s;o hard, that he enter'd the Lane with them, and Routed the whole Body of their Hor&s;e, and follow'd the execution of them above two miles.</P>
<P>BUT this was like to have been a dear &s;ucce&s;s; for S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> who lay with his new Army at <HI>Bath,</HI> and had drawn to him a good &s;up|ply out of the Garri&s;on at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> had directed this Body which was in <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> to retire before the King's Forces till they &s;hould joyn with him, who had &s;ent a fre&s;h, &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e and Dragoons, to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Retreat; which, by the advantage of a Hedge, had march'd with|out being di&s;cover'd: &s;o that the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon,</HI> being a &s;tranger <MILESTONE N="3$"> in the Country and the ways, pur&s;ued the Enemy into S^r <HI>William Waller</HI>'s Quarters, and till him&s;elf was pre&s;s'd by a fre&s;h Body of Hor&s;e and Dra|goons; when he was nece&s;&s;itated to retire in as good order as he could; and &s;ent the Prince, who followed him, word of the danger which at|tended them. His Highne&s;s hereupon, with what ha&s;t he could, drew back through the Village; choo&s;ing rather, with very good rea&s;on, to attend the Enemy in the plain Heath, than to be engaged in a narrow pa&s;&s;age: thither the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon</HI> with his Regiment came to him, broken and cha&s;ed by the Enemy; who immediately drew up a large Front of Hor&s;e and Dragoons, much &s;tronger than the Prince's Party, <MILESTONE N="4$"> who had only his own, and the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon</HI>'s Regiments, with &s;ome Gentlemen Voluntiers. The &s;treight, and nece&s;&s;ity he was in, was very great; for as he might &s;eem much too weak to Charge them, &s;o the danger might probably be much greater to retire over the&s;e fair Hills, being pur&s;ued with a fre&s;h Party much &s;uperior in number. Therefore he took a Gallant Re&s;olution, to give the Enemy a brisk Charge with his own Regiment upon their advance, whil&s;t the Earl rallied His, and prepared to &s;econd him, as there &s;hould be occa&s;ion. This was as &s;oon and fortunately executed as re&s;olv'd; the Prince in the head of the Re|giment Charging &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that he utterly broke, and routed that <MILESTONE N="5$"> part of the Front that receiv'd the impre&s;&s;ion. But allmo&s;t half the Enemies Hor&s;e, that, being extended larger than his Front, were not Charg'd, wheeled about, and Charg'd the Prince in the Rear; and at the
<PB N="217" REF="2580">
&s;ame time the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon,</HI> with his rallied Regiment, Charg'd Their Rear; and all this &s;o throughly perform'd, that they were mingled one among the other, and the good Sword was to decide the controver&s;y, their Pi&s;tols being &s;pent in the clo&s;e. The Prince him&s;elf receiv'd two &s;hrewd hurts in his head, and was beaten off his Hor&s;e; but he was pre|&s;ently reliev'd, and carried off; and the Enemy totally routed, and pur|&s;ued again by the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon;</HI> who had a fair execution upon them, as long as the light countenanced his cha&s;e, and then he return'd to the head Quarters at <HI>Wells;</HI> there having been in the&s;e Skirmi&s;hes three&s;core or four&s;core Men lo&s;t on the Princes Party, and three times <MILESTONE N="10"> that number by the Enemy; the Action being too quick to take many Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Wells</HI> the Army re&s;ted many days, as well to recover the Prince's wounds, being only cuts with Swords, as to con&s;ult what was next to be done; for they were now within di&s;tance of an Enemy that they knew would Fight with them. For S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> was at <HI>Bath</HI> with his whole Army, much encrea&s;ed by tho&s;e who were cha&s;ed out of the We&s;t; and re&s;olv'd not to advance, having all advantages of Provi&s;ions, and Pa&s;&s;es, till a new &s;upply, he every day expected from <HI>London,</HI> were arriv'd with him. On the other &s;ide, the Marquis was not only to pro|vide <MILESTONE N="20"> to meet with &s;o vigilant an Enemy, but to &s;ecure him&s;elf at his Rear, that the di&s;affection of the People behind him, who were only &s;ubdued, not converted, upon the advance of S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> might not take fre&s;h Courage. Though <HI>Cornwal</HI> was rea&s;onably &s;ecured, to keep off any impre&s;&s;ion upon it &s;elf from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> yet <HI>Devon-&s;hire</HI> was left in a very un&s;afe po&s;ture; there being only a &s;mall Party at <HI>Columb-John,</HI> a Hou&s;e of S^r <HI>John Acklands</HI> three miles off <HI>Exeter,</HI> to controul the power of that City, where the Earl of <HI>Stamford</HI> was; and to di&s;pute not only with any commotion, that might happen in the Coun|try, but with any power that might arrive by Sea. Upon the&s;e con&s;i|derations, <MILESTONE N="$0"> and the intelligence, that the Parliament had &s;ent directions to the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> their Admiral, <Q>&startq;to attend the <HI>Devon-&s;hire</HI> Coa&s;t&endq; with his Fleet,</Q> and take any advantage he could, the Marquis, by the advice of the Council of War, &s;ent S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> back into <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> with Colonel <HI>Howard</HI>'s Regiment of Hor&s;e, to Command the Forces which were then there, and to rai&s;e what Numbers more he could po&s;&s;ibly, for the blocking up that City, and reducing the County; and upon his arrival there, to &s;end up to the Army S^r <HI>James Hamilton</HI>'s Re|giment of Hor&s;e and Dragoons; which had been left in <HI>Devon-&s;hire;</HI> and, by the Licence they took, weaken'd the King's Party; &s;o that by <MILESTONE N="$0"> &s;ending this relief thither, he did not le&s;&s;en at all his own Numbers, yet gave great &s;trength to the reducing tho&s;e parts, as appear'd afterwards by the &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>AFTER this di&s;po&s;ition, and eight or ten days re&s;t at <HI>Wells,</HI> the Ar|my generally expre&s;&s;ing a chearful impatience to meet with the Enemy, of which, at that time, they had a greater contempt, than in rea&s;on they &s;hould have; the Prince, and Marquis, advanced to <HI>Frome,</HI> and thence to <HI>Bradford</HI> within four miles of <HI>Bath.</HI> And now no day pa&s;&s;ed without Action, and very &s;harp Skirmi&s;hes; S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> having receiv'd from <HI>London</HI> a fre&s;h Regiment of five hundred Hor&s;e, under <MILESTONE N="$0"> the Command of S^r <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerig;</HI> which were &s;o compleatly Arm'd, that they were called by the other &s;ide the Regiment of Lob&s;ters, be|cau&s;e of their bright Iron &s;hells, with which they were cover'd, being
<PB N="218" REF="2590">
perfect Cuira&s;&s;iers; and were the fir&s;t &s;een &s;o Arm'd on either &s;ide, and the fir&s;t that made any impre&s;&s;ion upon the King's Hor&s;e; who, being unarm'd, were not able to bear a &s;hock with them; be&s;ides that they were &s;ecure from hurts of the Sword, which were allmo&s;t the only Wea|pons the other were furni&s;h'd with.</P>
<P>THE contention was hitherto with Parties, in which the &s;ucce&s;&s;es were various, and allmo&s;t with equal lo&s;&s;es: for as S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> upon the fir&s;t advance from <HI>Wells,</HI> beat up a Regiment of Hor&s;e and Dragoons of S^r <HI>James Hamilton</HI>'s, and di&s;per&s;ed them; &s;o, within two days, the King's Forces beat a Party of His from a Pa&s;s near <HI>Bath,</HI> <MILESTONE N="$$"> where the Enemy lo&s;t two Field-pieces, and near an hundred Men. But S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> had the advantage in his ground, having a good City, well furni&s;h'd with provi&s;ions, to quarter his Army together in; and &s;o in his choice not to Fight, but upon extraordinary advantage. Where|as the King's Forces mu&s;t either di&s;per&s;e them&s;elves, and &s;o give the Enemy advantage upon their Quarters, or, keeping near together, lodge in the Field, and endure great di&s;tre&s;s of Provi&s;ion; the Country being &s;o di&s;affected, that only force could bring in any &s;upply or relief. Here|upon, after &s;everal attempts to engage the Enemy to a Battle upon equal terms, which having the advantage, he wi&s;ely avoided; the Mar|quis, <MILESTONE N="$$"> and Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> advanced with their whole Body to <HI>Marsfield,</HI> five miles beyond <HI>Bath</HI> towards <HI>Oxford;</HI> pre&s;uming, that, by this means, they &s;hould draw the Enemy from their place of advantage, his chief bu&s;ine&s;s being to hinder them from joyning with the King. And if they had been able to pre&s;erve that temper, and had neglected the Enemy, till he had quitted his advantages, it is probable they might have Fought upon as good terms as they de&s;ired. But the unrea&s;onable contempt they had of the Enemy, and confidence they &s;hould prevail in any ground, together with the &s;treights they endured for want of Provi&s;ions, and their want of Ammunition, which was &s;pent as much in the daily <MILESTONE N="3$"> Hedge Skirmi&s;hes, and upon their Guards, being &s;o near, as could have been in Battle, would not admit the patience; for S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> who was not to &s;uffer that Body to joyn with the King, no &s;ooner drew out his whole Army to <HI>Lan&s;down,</HI> which look'd towards <HI>Marsfield,</HI> but they &s;uffer'd them&s;elves to be engaged upon great di&s;advantage.</P>
<P>IT was upon the fifth of <HI>July</HI> when S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> a&s;&s;oon as it <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battle of</HI> Lan&s;down July 5.</NOTE> was light, po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him&s;elf of that Hill; and after he had, upon the brow of the Hill over the high way, rai&s;ed Brea&s;t-works with faggots and earth, and planted Cannon there, he &s;ent a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e towards <HI>Marsfield;</HI> which quickly Alarm'd the other Army, and was &s;hortly <MILESTONE N="4$"> driven back to their Body. As great a mind as the King's Forces had to cope with the Enemy, when they had drawn into Battalia, and found the Enemy fixed on the top of the Hill, they re&s;olv'd not to attack them upon &s;o great di&s;advantage; and &s;o retired again towards their old Quar|ters: which S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> perceiving, &s;ent his whole Body of Hor&s;e and Dragoons, down the Hill, to Charge the Rear and Flank of the King's Forces; which they did throughly, the Regiment of Cuira&s;&s;iers &s;o amazing the Hor&s;e they Charged, that they totally routed them; and, &s;tanding firm and un&s;haken them&s;elves, gave &s;o great terror to the King's Hor&s;e, who had never before turn'd from an Enemy, that no <MILESTONE N="5$"> example of their Officers, who did Their parts with invincible Courage, could make them Charge with the &s;ame confidence, and in the &s;ame manner they had u&s;ually done. However, in the end, after S^r <HI>Nicholas</HI>
<PB N="219" REF="2600">
<HI>Slanning</HI> with three hundred Mu&s;queteers, had fallen upon, and beaten their Re&s;erve of Dragooners, Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Car|narvon,</HI> rallying their Hor&s;e, and winging them with the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Mu&s;|queteers, Charged the Enemies Hor&s;e again, and totally routed them; and in the &s;ame manner receiv'd two Bodies more, and routed and cha&s;ed them to the Hill; where they &s;tood in a place allmo&s;t inacce&s;&s;ible. On the brow of the Hill there were Brea&s;t-works, on which were pretty Bodies of &s;mall &s;hot, and &s;ome Cannon; on either Flank grew a pretty thick Wood towards the declining of the Hill, in which &s;trong Parties of Mu&s;queteers were placed; at the Rear, was a very fair Plain, where <MILESTONE N="10"> the Re&s;erves of Hor&s;e and Foot &s;tood ranged: <Q>yet the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Foot were &s;o far from being appalled at this di&s;advantage, that they de&s;ired to fall on, and cryed out, &startq;that they might have leave to fetch of tho&s;e Can|non.&endq;</Q> In the end, order was given to attempt the Hill with Hor&s;e and Foot. Two &s;trong Parties of Mu&s;queteers were &s;ent into the Woods, which flanked the Enemy; and the Hor&s;e and other Mu&s;queteers up the Road way, which were Charged by the Enemies Hor&s;e, and routed; then S^r <HI>Bevil Greenvil</HI> advanced with a Party of Hor$e, on his right hand, that ground being be&s;t for Them; and his Mu&s;queteers on the left; him&s;elf leading up his Pikes in the middle; and in the face of their Can|non, <MILESTONE N="20"> and Small &s;hot from the Brea&s;t-works, gained the brow of the Hill; having &s;u&s;tain'd two full Charges of the Enemies Hor&s;e; but in the third Charge his Hor&s;e failing, and giving ground, he receiv'd, after other wounds, a blow on the Head with a Poll-Axe, with which he fell, and many of his Officers about him; yet the Mu&s;queteers fired &s;o fa&s;t upon the Enemies Hor&s;e, that they quitted their ground, and the two Wings, who were &s;ent to clear the Woods, having done their Work, and gain'd tho&s;e parts of the Hill, at the &s;ame time beat off their Ene|mies Foot, and became po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of the Brea&s;t-works; and &s;o made way for their whole Body of Hor&s;e, Foot, and Cannon, to a&s;cend the <MILESTONE N="30"> Hill; which they quickly did, and planted them&s;elves on the ground they had wone; the Enemy retiring about Demy Culvering &s;hot be|hind a Stone Wall upon the &s;ame Level, and &s;tanding in rea&s;onable good order.</P>
<P>EITHER Party was &s;ufficiently tired, and battered, to be contented to &s;tand &s;till. The King's Hor&s;e were &s;o &s;haken, that of two thou&s;and which were upon the Field in the morning, there were not above &s;ix hundred on the top of the Hill. The Enemy was exceedingly &s;catter'd too, and had no mind to venture on plain ground with tho&s;e who had beaten them from the Hill; &s;o that, exchanging only &s;ome &s;hot from <MILESTONE N="40"> their Ordnance, they look'd one upon another till the night interpo&s;ed. About twelve of the Clock, it being very dark, the Enemy made a &s;hew of moving towards the ground they had lo&s;t; but giving a &s;mart Volly of &s;mall &s;hot, and finding them&s;elves An&s;wer'd with the like, they made no more noi&s;e; which the Prince ob&s;erving, he &s;ent a Common Soldier to hearken as near the place, where they were, as he could; <Q>who brought word, &startq;that the Enemy had le&s;t lighted matches in the Wall behind which&endq; they had lain, and were drawn off the Field;</Q> which was true; &s;o that, a&s;&s;oon as it was day, the King's Army found them&s;elves po&s;&s;e&s;s'd en|tirely of the Field, and the Dead, and all other En&s;igns of Victory: <MILESTONE N="$0"> S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> being march'd to <HI>Bath,</HI> in &s;o much di&s;order and apprehen&s;ion, that he left great &s;tore of Armes, and ten Barrels of Pow|der, behind him; which was a very &s;ea&s;onable &s;upply to the other &s;ide,
<PB N="220" REF="2610">
who had &s;pent, in that days Service, no le&s;s than four&s;core Barrels, and had not a &s;afe proportion left.</P>
<P>IN this Battle, on the King's part, there were more Officers and Gen|tlemen of Quality &s;lain, than Common Men; and more hurt, than &s;lain. That which would have clouded any Victory, and made the lo&s;s of others le&s;s &s;poken of, was the death of S^r <HI>Bevil Greenvil.</HI> He was in|deed <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> Bevil Greenvil <HI>&s;lain.</HI></NOTE> an excellent Per&s;on, who&s;e Activity, Intere&s;t, and Reputation, was the Foundation of what had been done in <HI>Cornwal;</HI> and his temper, and affections, &s;o publick, that no accident, which happen'd, could make any impre&s;&s;ions in him; and His example kept others from taking any <MILESTONE N="1$"> thing ill, or at lea&s;t &s;eeming to do &s;o. In a word, a brighter Courage, and a gentler Di&s;po&s;ition, were never married together to make the mo&s;t chearful, and innocent conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>VERY many Officers and Per&s;ons of Quality were hurt; as the Lord <HI>Arundel</HI> of <HI>Wardour,</HI> &s;hot in the thigh with a brace of Pi&s;tol Bullets; S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> &s;hot through the Arme with a Mu&s;quet; S^r <HI>George Vaughan,</HI> and many others, hurt in the head of their Troops with Swords and Poll-Axes; of which, none of name died. But the morning added much to the Melancholy of their Victory, when the Field was entirely their own. For S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> riding up and down the Field to vi&s;it <MILESTONE N="2$"> the hurt Men, and to put the Soldiers in order, and readine&s;s for mo|tion, &s;itting on his Hor&s;e, with other Officers and Soldiers about him, near a Waggon of Ammunition, in which were eight Barrels of Powder; whether by treachery, or meer accident, is uncertain, the Powder was blown up; and many, who &s;tood neare&s;t, kill'd; and many more maim'd; among whom S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> and Serjeant Major <HI>Sheldon</HI> were mi|&s;erably hurt; of which, Major <HI>Sheldon,</HI> who was thought to be in le&s;s danger than the other, died the next day, to the general grief of the whole Army, where he was wonderfully belov'd, as a Man of an un|daunted Courage, and as great gentlene&s;s of Nature. S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> <MILESTONE N="3$"> having hardly &s;o much life, as not to be number'd with the dead, was put into a Litter, and then the Army march'd to their old Quarters at <HI>Marsfield;</HI> exceedingly ca&s;t down with their mornings misfortune (S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> being indeed the Soldiers darling) where they repo&s;ed them&s;elves the next day, principally in care of S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton;</HI> who, though there were hope of his recovery, was not fit to travel. In this time many of the Hor&s;e, which had been routed in the morning, before the Hill was wone, found the way to <HI>Oxford;</HI> and, according to the cu&s;tom of tho&s;e who run away, reported all to be lo&s;t, with many par|ticular accidents, which they fancied very like to happen when they left the Field; but the next day brought a punctual adverti&s;ement from the Marquis, but, withall, a de&s;ire of a Regiment or two of fre&s;h Hor&s;e, and a &s;upply of Ammunition; whereupon the Earl of <HI>Crawford</HI> with his Regiment of Hor&s;e, con&s;i&s;ting of near five hundred, was directed to advance that way, with &s;uch a proportion of Ammunition as was de&s;ired.</P>
<P>AFTER a days re&s;t at <HI>Marsfield,</HI> it being under&s;tood that S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> was &s;till at <HI>Bath</HI> (his Army having been rather &s;urpri&s;ed and di&s;comforted with the incredible boldne&s;s of the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Foot, than much weaken'd by the Number &s;lain, which was no greater than on the King's part) and that he had &s;ent for fre&s;h &s;upply from <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> it was concluded, rather to march to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and &s;o to joyn with the King's Army, than to &s;tay and attend the Enemy, who was &s;o near his &s;upplies:

And &s;o they march'd towards <HI>Chippenham.</HI> But when S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> had Intelligence of the blowing up of the Powder, of which he well knew there was &s;carcely enough before, and of the hurt it had done, he infu&s;ed new &s;pirit into his Men; and verily believ'd, that they had no Ammunition, and that the lo&s;s of S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> (whom the People took to be the Soul of that Army, the other Names being not &s;o much &s;poken of, or &s;o well known, and at this time believ'd to be dead) would be found in the Spirits of the Soldiers; and having gotten &s;ome fre&s;h Men from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and more from the inclinations of the three Counties of <HI>Wilts, Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> which joyn'd about <HI>Bath,</HI> in the <MILESTONE N="10"> mo&s;t ab&s;olute di&s;affected parts of all three, he follow'd the Marquis towards <HI>Chippenham;</HI> to which he was as near from <HI>Bath,</HI> as the other from <HI>Marsfield.</HI></P>
<P>THE next day, early in the morning, upon notice that the Enemy was in di&s;tance, the Prince, and the Marquis drew back the Army through <HI>Chippenham,</HI> and pre&s;ented them&s;elves in Battalia to the Enemy; being very well contented to fight in &s;uch a place, where the &s;ucce&s;s was to depend more on their Foot, who were unque&s;tionably $$cellent, than on their Hor&s;e, which were at be&s;t weary, though their Officers were, to Envy, forward and re&s;olute. But S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> who was a right <MILESTONE N="20"> good choo&s;er of advantages, liked not that ground; relying as much upon his Hor&s;e, who had gotten Credit, and Courage, and as little upon his Foot, who were only well Arm'd, and well Bodied, very vulgarly Spirited, and Officer'd: &s;o that having &s;tood all night in Battalia, and the Enemy not coming on, the Prince and Marquis, the next day, ad|vanced towards the <HI>Devi&s;es;</HI> S^r <HI>Nicholas Slanning,</HI> with great Spirit and Prudence, &s;ecuring the Rear with &s;trong Parties of Mu&s;queteers; with which he gave the Enemy, who pre&s;s'd upon them very &s;martly, &s;o much Interruption, that S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> de&s;pairing of overtaking, &s;ent a Trumpet to the Marquis, with a Letter; offering a pitch'd Field <MILESTONE N="30"> at a place of his own choo&s;ing, out of the way. The which being ea&s;ily under&s;tood to be only a Stratagem to beget a delay in the march, the Marquis carried the Trumpet three or four miles with him, and then &s;ent him back with &s;uch an An&s;wer as was fit. There were, all this day, perpetual and &s;harp Skirmi&s;hes in the Rear; the Enemy pre&s;&s;ing very hard, and being allways with lo&s;s repul&s;ed, till the Army &s;afely reach'd the <HI>Devi&s;es.</HI></P>
<P>THEN the ca&s;e was alter'd for their retreat to <HI>Oxford,</HI> the Enemy being upon them with improvement of Courage, and improvement of Numbers; <Q>S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> having di&s;per&s;ed his Warrants over the <MILESTONE N="40"> Country, &s;ignifying, &startq;&endq;that he had beaten the Marquis,</Q> <Q>and requiring the People &startq;to ri&s;e in all places for the apprehen&s;ion of his &s;catter'd,&endq; and di&s;per&s;ed Troops;</Q> which confidence, Men conceiv'd, could not proceed from le&s;s than a manife&s;t Victory; and &s;o they flocked to Him as the Ma&s;ter of the Field. The Foot were no more now to make the retreat, the &s;ituation of the place they were now in, being &s;uch as they could move no way towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> but over a Campagne of many miles, where the &s;tronger in Hor&s;e mu&s;t needs prevail.</P>
<P>HEREUPON, it was unanimou&s;ly advi&s;ed, and con&s;ented to, that the Lord Marquis and Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> &s;hould that night break through, <MILESTONE N="50"> with all the Hor&s;e, to <HI>Oxford;</HI> and that S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> (who, by this, was &s;uppo&s;ed pa&s;t danger of death, and could hear and &s;peak well enough, though he could not &s;ee or &s;tir) with the Earl of <HI>Marlborough,</HI> who was
<PB N="222" REF="2630">
General of the Artillery, the Lord <HI>Mohun,</HI> and other good Officers of Foot, &s;hould &s;tay there with their Foot, and Cannon, where it was hoped they might defend them&s;elves, for a few days, till the General might return with relief from <HI>Oxford;</HI> which was not above thirty miles off. This re&s;olution was pur&s;ued; and, the &s;ame night, all the Hor&s;e got &s;afe away into the King's Quarters, and the Prince, and Marquis, in the morning, came to <HI>Oxford;</HI> by which time, S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> had drawn all his Forces about the <HI>Devi&s;es.</HI> The Town was open, without the lea&s;t Fortification, or Defence, but &s;mall Ditches and Hedges; upon which the Foot were placed, and &s;ome pieces of Cannon conveniently <MILESTONE N="10"> planted. The Avenues, which were many, were quickly Barricadoed to hinder the entrance of the Hor&s;e, which was principally apprehended. S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> had &s;oon notice of the remove of the Hor&s;e; and there|fore, intending that pur&s;uit no farther, he brought his whole Force clo&s;e to the Town, and beleaguered it round; and having rai&s;ed a Battery upon a Hill near the Town, he poured in his &s;hot upon it without in|termi&s;&s;ion, and attempted to enter in &s;everal other places with Hor&s;e, Foot, and Cannon; but was in all places more re&s;olutely re&s;i&s;ted, and repul&s;ed. At the &s;ame time, having Intelligence (as his Intelligence was allways mo&s;t exact in what&s;oever concern'd him) of the Earl of <MILESTONE N="2$"> <HI>Crawford</HI>'s marching with a &s;upply of Powder, according to order, af|ter the fir&s;t Battle of <HI>Lan&s;down,</HI> he &s;ent a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e and Dragoons to intercept him; who, before he knew of the alterations which had happen'd, and of the remove of the Hor&s;e towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> was &s;o far engaged, that he hardly e&s;caped with the lo&s;s of his Ammu|nition, and a Troop or two of his Hor&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>UPON this improvement of his &s;ucce&s;s, S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> reckon'd his Victory out of que&s;tion; and thereupon &s;ent a Trumpet into the Town to &s;ummon the be&s;ieged, to let them know, &startq;that he had cut off their relief, and that their State was now de&s;perate; and therefore ad|vi&s;ed them to &s;ubmit them&s;elves to the Parliament, with whom he&endq; would mediate on their behalf.</Q> They in the Town were not &s;orry for the Overture; not that they apprehended, it would produce any conditions they &s;hould accept, but that they might gain &s;ome time of re&s;t by it: for the &s;treights they were in, were too great for any minds not prepared to pre&s;erve their honour at any rates. When the Enemy came fir&s;t before the Town, and the Guards were &s;upplied with Ammu|nition for their duty, there was but one hundred and fifty weight of Match left in the Store; whereupon diligent Officers were directed to &s;earch every Hou&s;e in the Town, and to take all the Bed-cords they could find, and to cau&s;e them to be &s;peedily beaten, and boyled. By this &s;uddain expedient, there was, by the next morning, provided fifteen hundred weight of &s;uch &s;erviceable Match, as very well endured that &s;harp &s;ervice. The compa&s;s of the ground they were to keep, was &s;o large, and the Enemy pre&s;s'd &s;o hard upon all places, that their whole Body were upon perpetual duty together, neither Officer, or Soldier having any time for re&s;t; and the activity of the Chief Officers was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to keep up the Courage of the Common Men, who well enough under&s;tood the danger they were in, and therefore they were very glad of this Me&s;&s;age; <Q>and return'd, &startq;that they would &s;end an Officer to Treat&endq; if a Ce&s;&s;ation were agreed to during the time of the Treaty;</Q> which was con&s;ented to, if it were &s;uddainly expedited.</P>
<P>ON the Party of the Be&s;ieged were propo&s;ed &s;uch terms, as migh
<PB N="223" REF="2640">
take up mo&s;t time in the Debate, and might imply Courage and Re&s;o|lution to hold out. S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> on the other hand, offer'd only Quarter, and civil u&s;age to the Officers, and leave to the Common Sol|diers to return to their Hou&s;es without their Armes, except they would voluntarily choo&s;e to &s;erve the Parliament. The&s;e being terms many of the Officers would not have &s;ubmitted to in the la&s;t extreme, the Treaty ended; after tho&s;e in the Town had gained what they only looked for, &s;even or eight hours &s;leep, and &s;o long time &s;paring of Ammunition. The truth is, S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> was &s;o confident that they were at his Mercy, <Q>that he had written to the Parliament, &startq;that their work was <MILESTONE N="10"> done, and that, by the next Po&s;t, he would &s;end the Number, and&endq; Quality of his Pri&s;oners;</Q> neither did he imagine it po&s;&s;ible, that any relief could have been &s;ent from <HI>Oxford;</HI> the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> to whom he had &s;ignified his &s;ucce&s;s, and the po&s;ture he was in, lying with his whole Army at <HI>Thame,</HI> within ten miles of it. But the importance was too well under&s;tood by the King to omit any thing, that might, with the utmo&s;t hazard, be attempted for the redeeming tho&s;e Men, who had wrought &s;uch wonders for him. And therefore, a&s;&s;oon as the Marquis, and Prince, arriv'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> with the &s;ad and unexpected news, and relation of the di&s;tre&s;s of their Friends, though the Queen was then on <MILESTONE N="20"> her march towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> and the King had appointed to meet her two days Journey for her &s;ecurity, his Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd to take only his own Guards of Hor&s;e, and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Regiment, for that expedi|tion; and &s;ent the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> with all the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e, to march that very day in which the adverti&s;ement came to him, towards the <HI>Devi&s;es;</HI> &s;o that the Marquis and the Prince coming to <HI>Oxford</HI> on the <HI>Monday</HI> morning, the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> that night, moved towards the work; and Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> returning with him as a Voluntier, but the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> Commanding in Chief, appear'd, on the <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> about noon, upon the plain within two miles of the Town. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> had with him fifteen hundred Hor&s;e, and no more, and two &s;mall Field-pieces, which he &s;hot off to give the Town notice of his coming; having it in his hopes, that, it being a fair Campagne about the Town, when the Enemy &s;hould ri&s;e from before it, he &s;hould be able in &s;pite of them to joyn with the Foot, and &s;o to have a fair Field for it; which would be &s;till di&s;advantageous enough, the Enemy being Superior by much in Hor&s;e, very few of tho&s;e, who had broken away from the <HI>Devi&s;es</HI> (except the Prince him&s;elf, the Earl of <HI>Carnar|von,</HI> and &s;ome other Officers) being come up with them, becau&s;e they were tired, and di&s;per&s;ed. The Enemy, careful to prevent the joyning <MILESTONE N="$0"> of this Party of Hor&s;e with the Foot, and fully adverti&s;ed of their com|ing, drew off, on all parts, from the Town; and put them&s;elves in Bat|talia upon the top of a fair Hill, called <HI>Roundway-</HI>Down; over which the King's Forces were nece&s;&s;arily to march, being full two miles off the Town: they within conceiv'd it hardly po&s;&s;ible, that the relief, they expected from <HI>Oxford,</HI> could &s;o &s;oon arrive; all the Me&s;&s;engers, who were &s;ent to give notice of it, having mi&s;carried by the clo&s;ene&s;s of the Siege; and therefore &s;u&s;pected the warning pieces from the Plain, and the drawing off the Town by the Enemy, to be a Stratagem to cou&s;en the Foot from tho&s;e Po&s;ts they defended, into the open Field; and &s;o, <MILESTONE N="$0"> very rea&s;onably, being in readine&s;s to march, they waited a &s;urer Evi|dence, that their Friends were at hand; which &s;hortly arriv'd, and a&s;|&s;ured them, <Q>&startq;&endq; that the Prince was near and expected them.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="224" REF="2650">
IT will be ea&s;ily conceived, with what alacrity they advanced to meet him; but S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> had purpo&s;ely cho&s;e that ground to hinder that conjunction, and advanced &s;o fa&s;t on the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> that with|out &s;uch removes, and traver&s;es, as might give his Men &s;ome appre|hen&s;ion, that Lord could not expect the Foot from the Town; and therefore he put his Troops in order upon that ground to expect the Enemies Charge, who were &s;omewhat more than Mu&s;quet &s;hot off in order of Battle.</P>
<P>HERE S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> out of pure gayety, departed from an advan|tage he could not again recover; for being in excellent order of Battle, <MILESTONE N="10"> with &s;trong wings of Hor&s;e to his Foot, and a good Re&s;erve placed, and his Cannon u&s;efully planted, apprehending &s;till the conjunction between the Hor&s;e and the Foot in the Town, and gratifying his Enemy with the &s;ame contempt, which had &s;o often brought inconveniences upon them, and di&s;cerning their number Inferior to that he had before (as he thought) ma&s;ter'd, he march'd, with his whole Body of Hor&s;e, from his Foot, to Charge the Enemy; appointing S^r <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerig</HI> with his Cuira&s;&s;iers apart, to make the fir&s;t impre&s;&s;ion; who was encounter'd by S^r <HI>John Byron,</HI> in who&s;e Regiment the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon</HI> Charged as a Volun|tier; and after a &s;harp conflict, in which S^r <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerig</HI> receiv'd <MILESTONE N="$0"> many wounds, that impenetrable Regiment was Routed, and, in a full Career, cha&s;ed upon their other Hor&s;e. At the &s;ame time, the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> Charging them from divi&s;ion to divi&s;ion, as they were ranged, in half an hour, &s;o &s;uddain Alterations the accidents of War introduce, the whole entire Body of the Triumphant Hor&s;e were &s;o totally Routed, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battle of</HI> Roundway<HI>-Down, where|in S^r</HI> William Waller <HI>is Routed.</HI></NOTE> and Di&s;per&s;ed, that there was not one of them to be &s;een upon that large &s;pacious Down; every Man &s;hifting for him&s;elf with greater dan|ger by the Precipices of that Hill, than he could have undergone by op|po&s;ing his pur&s;uer. But as it was an unhappy ground to fly, &s;o it was as ill for the pur&s;uer; and after the Rout, more peri&s;h'd by falls and <MILESTONE N="0$"> brui&s;es from their Hor&s;es, down the Precipices, than by the Sword. The Foot &s;tood &s;till firm, making &s;hew of a gallant Re&s;i&s;tance; but the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> quickly &s;ei&s;ed their Cannon, and turn'd them upon them, at the &s;ame time that the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Foot, who were by this come from the Town, were ready likewi&s;e to Charge them; upon which their hearts failed; and &s;o they were Charged on all &s;ides, and either killed, or taken Pri&s;oners, very few e&s;caping; the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> retaining too fre&s;h a Memory of their late di&s;tre&s;&s;es, and revenging them&s;elves on tho&s;e who had con|tributed thereunto. S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> him&s;elf, with a &s;mall Train, fled into <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which had &s;acrificed a great part of their Garri&s;on in his <MILESTONE N="$$"> Defeat; and &s;o were even ready to expire at his entry into the Town, him&s;elf bringing the fir&s;t news of his di&s;a&s;ter.</P>
<P>THIS glorious day, for it was a day of Triumph, redeem'd for that time the King's whole Affairs, &s;o that all Clouds that &s;hadowed them &s;eem'd to be di&s;pelled, and a bright light of &s;ucce&s;s to &s;hine over the whole Kingdom. There were in this Battle &s;lain, on the Enemies part, above &s;ix hundred on the place; nine hundred Pri&s;oners taken, be&s;ides two or three hundred retaken and redeem'd, whom they had gathered up in the Skirmi&s;hes, and pur&s;uit; with all their Cannon, being eight pieces of Bra&s;s Ordnance; all their Armes, Ammunition, Waggons, Bag|gage, <MILESTONE N="5$"> and Victual; eight and twenty Foot En&s;igns, and nine Cornets; and all this by a Party of fifteen hundred Hor&s;e, with two &s;mall Field|pieces (for the Victory was perfect, upon the matter, before the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI>
<PB N="225" REF="2660">
came up; though the Enemies Foot were &s;uffer'd to &s;tand in a Body uncharged, out of ceremony, till They came; that they might be re|fre&s;h'd with a &s;hare in the Conque&s;t) again&s;t a Body of full two thou&s;and Hor&s;e, five hundred Dragoons, and near three thou&s;and Foot, with an excellent Train of Artillery. So that the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> had great rea&s;on to think their deliverance, and Victory at <HI>Roundway,</HI> more &s;ignal and won|derful, than the other at <HI>Stratton,</HI> &s;ave that the fir&s;t might be thought the Parent of the latter, and the lo&s;s on the King's Party was le&s;s; for in This there were &s;lain very few; and, of name, none but <HI>Dudley Smith,</HI> an hone&s;t and valiant young Gentleman; who was allways a Voluntier <MILESTONE N="10"> with the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> and among the fir&s;t upon any action of danger.</P>
<P>BESIDES the pre&s;ent fruit of this Victory, the King receiv'd an ad|vantage from the Jealou&s;y, that, from thence, grew among the Officers of the Parliament Armies. For S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> believ'd him&s;elf to be ab&s;olutely betrayed, and &s;acrificed by the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> out of envy at the great things he had done, which &s;eem'd to eclip&s;e His Glories; <Q>and complain'd, &startq;that he lying with his whole Army within ten miles of <HI>Oxford,</HI> &s;hould &s;uffer the Chief &s;trength of that place t$ march thirty miles to de&s;troy him, without &s;o much as &s;ending out a Party to fol|low them, or to Alarm <HI>Oxford,</HI> by which they would have been pro|bably&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> recalled.</Q> <Q>On the other hand, the Earl, di&s;daining to be thought his Rival, reproach'd the other with &startq;un&s;oldierly neglects, and want of Courage, to be beaten by a handful of Men, and to have de&s;erted his Foot and Cannon, without engaging his own Per&s;on in one Charge&endq; again&s;t the Enemy.</Q> Wherever the fault was, it was never forgiven; but from the Enmity that proceeded from thence, the King often after|wards reaped very notable, and &s;ea&s;onable advantages; which will be remember'd in their places.</P>
<P>THIS ble&s;&s;ed Defeat happen'd to be upon the &s;ame day, and upon the &s;ame time of the day, when the King met the Queen upon the Field <MILESTONE N="30"> near <HI>Keinton,</HI> under <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> where the Battle had been fought in <HI>October</HI> before; and before their Maje&s;ties came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> they receiv'd the happy news of it. It is ea&s;y to imagine the joy with which it was receiv'd, all Men rai&s;ing their fallen Spirits to too great a height, as though they &s;hould now go through all the work without farther oppo&s;ition; and this tran&s;port to either extremes was too natural upon all the Vi|ci&s;&s;itudes of the War; and it was &s;ome allay to the welcome News of the Victory to &s;ome Men, that it had been obtain'd under the Command and Conduct of <HI>Wilmot;</HI> who was very much in Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s di&s;|e&s;teem, and not in any notable degree of favour with the King, but much <MILESTONE N="$0"> belov'd by all the good fellow&s;hip of the Army; which was too great a Body. It was now time for the King's Army, Victorious in &s;o many Encounters, to take the Field; upon What Enterpri&s;e, was the Que|&s;tion. This overthrow of <HI>Waller</HI> had infinitely &s;urpri&s;ed, and encrea&s;ed the di&s;tractions at <HI>London.</HI> They had &s;een the Copy of the Warrants, which his vanity had cau&s;ed to be di&s;per&s;ed, after the Action at <HI>Lan&s;|down;</HI> <Q>in which he declared, &startq;that he had Routed the Marquis's Army, and was in pur&s;uit of them; and therefore Commanded the Ju&s;tices of Peace, and Con&s;tables, to give order for the apprehen&s;ion of them,&endq; as they $led di&s;per&s;ed;</Q> and expected every day, that the Marquis <MILESTONE N="$$"> would be &s;ent up Pri&s;oner: and now to hear that his whole invincible Army was defeated, and him&s;elf fled, upon the matter, alone (for ill news is for the mo&s;t part made wor&s;e, as the be&s;t is reported to be better than
<PB N="226" REF="2670">
it is) brought them to their Wits end; &s;o that they could little advance the recruiting the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> his Army; who in his Per&s;on likewi&s;e grew more &s;ullen towards them, and re&s;ented their little regard of him, and grew every day more conver&s;ant with the Earls of <HI>Nothumberland,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> and others who were mo&s;t weary of the War, and would be glad of Peace upon ea&s;y terms.</P>
<P>THE King's Army receiv'd a fair addition, by the conjuncture with <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King meets the Queen near</HI> Keinton; <HI>&s;he coming with a great Recruit.</HI></NOTE> tho&s;e Forces which attended the Queen; for her Maje&s;ty brought with her above two thou&s;and Foot, well Arm'd, and one thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and &s;ix pieces of Cannon, and two Mortars, and about one hundred <MILESTONE N="10"> Waggons: So that a&s;&s;oon as their Maje&s;ties came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who had &s;pent his time about <HI>Thame,</HI> and <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> without any Action after that Skirmi&s;h in which M^r <HI>Hambden</HI> was &s;lain, &s;ave by &s;mall Parties of which there was none of Name, or Note, but one hand&s;ome &s;mart conflict between a Party of five hundred Hor&s;e and Dragoons, Commanded by Colonel <HI>Middleton,</HI> a <HI>Scotch-</HI>man, on the Parliament Party, and a Regiment of Hor&s;e, Commanded by S^r <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> on the King's; where, after a very Soldierly conte&s;t, and more blood drawn than was u&s;ual upon &s;uch Actions, the King's Party pre|vailed, returning with &s;ome Pri&s;oners of Name, and the &s;laughter of <MILESTONE N="20"> one hundred of their Enemy, not without &s;ome lo&s;s of their own: The Earl, I &s;ay, retired with his Army broken, and di&s;hearten'd to <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>retires from</HI> Thame <HI>with his Ar|my to</HI> Ux|bridge.</NOTE> giving over any thought of fighting with the King, till he &s;hould be re|cruited, with Hor&s;e, Men, and Money; and &s;uffering no le&s;s in the talk of the People (who began to a&s;&s;ume a great freedom in di&s;cour&s;e) for not interpo&s;ing to hinder the Queens march to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and joyning with the King, than for &s;itting &s;till &s;o near <HI>Oxford,</HI> whil&s;t the Lord <HI>Wil|mot</HI> went from thence to the ruin of S^r <HI>William Waller.</HI></P>
<P>AFTER which Defeat, the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> retired to <HI>Oxford</HI> to attend his Maje&s;ty; and the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Army (for that name it de&s;ervedly kept &s;till, though it receiv'd &s;o good an encrea&s;e by the Marquis, and Princes joyning with them) drew back, and po&s;&s;e&s;s'd them&s;elves of <HI>Bath,</HI> which was &s;oon quitted to them, upon the overthrow of <HI>Waller;</HI> that Gar|ri&s;on being withdrawn to reinforce <HI>Bri&s;tol.</HI> At <HI>Bath</HI> they re&s;ted, and refre&s;h'd them&s;elves, till they might receive new Orders from the King; who, upon full advice, and con&s;ideration of the State he was in, and the broken condition of the Enemy, re&s;olv'd to make an attempt upon the City of <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> to which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was mo&s;t inclined, for his be|ing di&s;appointed in a former de&s;ign; and where there were many well affected to the King's Service from the beginning, and more &s;ince the execution of tho&s;e two eminent Citizens.

which tho&s;e who &s;u&s;pected the wor&s;t had &s;ent a board, but with many Per&s;ons of Quality; who, being unwilling to run the hazard of a Siege, thought that way to have &s;ecured them&s;elves, and to have e&s;caped to <HI>London;</HI> and &s;o were all taken Pri&s;oners. <Q>The next day, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> came to his Brother, and the Marquis, and a general Council of all the principal Officers of both Armies being a&s;&s;embled, it was Debated, &startq;in what Manner, they &s;hould proceed, by A&s;&s;ault or&endq; Approach.</Q></P>
<P>THERE were in the Town five and twenty hundred Foot, and a Re|giment of Hor&s;e and Dragoons; the Line about the Town was fini&s;h'd; <MILESTONE N="10"> yet in &s;ome places the graff was wider, and deeper than in others. The Ca&s;tle within the Town was very well prepared, and &s;upplied with great &s;tore of Provi&s;ions to endure a Siege. <Q>The opinions were &s;everal: The Officers of the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> were of opinion, &startq;that it was be&s;t to proceed by way of Approach; becau&s;e, the ground being very good, it would in a very &s;hort time be done; and &s;ince there was no Army of the Ene|my in a po&s;&s;ibility to relieve it, the &s;ecure&s;t way would be the be&s;t; whereas the Works were &s;o good, that they mu&s;t expect to lo&s;e very many Men; and, if they were beaten off, all their Summer hopes would be de&s;troyed; it not being ea&s;y, again to make up the &s;pirit of the Ar|my&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> for a new Action.</Q> <Q>Be&s;ides, they alledg'd, &startq;the well affected Party in the City, which was believ'd to be very great, would, after they had been clo&s;ely Be&s;ieged three or four days, have a greater influence upon the Soldier, and be able to do more towards the Surrender, than they could upon a Storm; when they would be equally &s;en&s;ible of the di&s;|order of the Soldier, and their own damage by plunder, as the other; and the too late example of the executed Citizens, would keep Men&endq; from offering at any in&s;urrection in the City.</Q></P>
<P>ON the other hand, Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and all the Officers of His Army, very earne&s;tly de&s;ired to A&s;&s;ault it; <Q>alledg'd, &startq;the Work to be ea&s;y, and <MILESTONE N="30"> the Soldiers fitter for any brisk attempt, than a dull patient de&s;ign; and that the Army would be more weaken'd by the latter, than the former: that the City, not having yet recover'd the con&s;ternation of S^r <HI>William Waller</HI>'s Defeat, was &s;o full of horror, that it would make a very weak Defence: that there was no Soldier of experience in the Town, and the Governour him&s;elf not like to endure the terror of a Storm: whereas, if they gave them time to con&s;ider, and to look long upon them with a Wall between, they would grow confirm'd, and re|&s;olute, and courage would &s;upply the place of skill; and having plen|ty of all kinds of Provi&s;ions within the Town, they would grow &s;trong, <MILESTONE N="40"> and peremptory, whil&s;t the Be&s;iegers grew le&s;s vigorous, and di&s;|hearten'd.&endq;</Q> The&s;e rea&s;ons, and the Prince's importunity, with &s;ome in&s;inuations of knowing more than was fit to be &s;poken, as if &s;omewhat would be done within the Town, that mu&s;t not be mention'd, and a glorious contempt of danger, prevailed &s;o far, that it was con&s;ented to, on all parts, to A&s;&s;ault the Town the next morning at three places on the <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire</HI> &s;ide, and at three places on the <HI>Glouce&s;ter-&s;hire</HI> &s;ide, at the break of day. The truth is, both opinions, with regard to their different circum&s;tances, were in them&s;elves rea&s;onable. For the <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter-&s;hire</HI> &s;ide, where Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was, might be Storm'd, the graff <MILESTONE N="50"> being &s;hallow, and the Wall, in &s;ome places, low, and weak; which could not be ea&s;ily Approach'd, by rea&s;on the ground was rocky, and the re|doubts high and very &s;trong, which overlook'd the ground; on the other
<PB N="228" REF="2690">
&s;ide, the ground was very ea&s;y to Approach, and as inconvenient, and dangerous to Storm, by rea&s;on of a plain level before the Line, and a broad and deep graff, and the Line, throughout, better flanker'd than the other.</P>
<P>THE next morning, with little other Provi&s;ions fit for &s;uch a Work, than the Courage of the A&s;&s;ailants, both Armies fell on. On the We&s;t &s;ide, where the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> were, they a&s;&s;aulted the Line in three places; one divi&s;ion led by S^r <HI>Nicholas Slanning,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted with Colonel <HI>John Tre|vannion,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Slingsby,</HI> and three more Field Officers; too great a number of &s;uch Officers to conduct &s;o &s;mall a Party as five <MILESTONE N="10"> hundred Men, if there had not been an immoderate di&s;dain of danger, and appetite of glory: Another divi&s;ion, on the right hand, was led by Colonel <HI>Buck,</HI> a&s;&s;i&s;ted by Colonel <HI>Wagstaffe,</HI> Colonel <HI>Bernard A&s;hley,</HI> who Commanded the Regiment of the Lord Marquis <HI>Hertford,</HI> with other Field Officers: And the third divi&s;ion, on the left hand, led by S^r <HI>Thomas Ba&s;&s;et,</HI> who was Major General of the <HI>Corni&s;h.</HI> The&s;e three divi&s;ions fell on together with that Courage, and Re&s;olution, as nothing but death could controul; and though the middle divi&s;ion got into the graff, and &s;o near filled it, that &s;ome mounted the Wall, yet by the pro|digious di&s;advantage of the ground, and the full defence the Be&s;ieged <MILESTONE N="20"> made within, they were driven back with a great &s;laughter; the Com|mon Soldiers, after their Chief Officers were kill'd, or de&s;perately wound|ed, finding it a bootle&s;s attempt.</P>
<P>ON Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s &s;ide, it was A&s;&s;aulted with equal Courage, and allmo&s;t equal lo&s;s, but with better &s;ucce&s;s; for though that divi&s;ion led on by the Lord <HI>Grandi&s;on,</HI> Colonel General of the Foot, was beaten off, the Lord <HI>Grandi&s;on</HI> him&s;elf being hurt; and the other, led by Colonel <HI>Bella&s;is,</HI> likewi&s;e had no better fortune; yet Colonel <HI>Wa&s;hington,</HI> with a le&s;s Party, finding a place in the Curtaine (between the places A&s;|&s;aulted by the other two) weaker than the re&s;t, enter'd, and quickly <MILESTONE N="30"> made room for the Hor&s;e to follow. The Enemy, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;aw the Line enter'd in one place, either out of fear, or by Command of their Officers, quit their Po&s;ts; &s;o that the Prince enter'd with his Foot and Hor&s;e into the Suburbs; &s;ending for one thou&s;and of the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Foot, which were pre&s;ently &s;ent to &s;econd him; and march'd up to <HI>Frome|gate,</HI> lo&s;ing many Men, and &s;ome very good Officers, by &s;hot from the Walls, and Windows; in&s;omuch as all Men were much ca&s;t down to &s;ee &s;o little gotten with &s;o great a lo&s;s; for they had &s;till a more difficult entrance into the Town, than they had yet pa&s;&s;ed, and where their Hor&s;e could be of no u&s;e to them; when, to the exceeding comfort of Ge|nerals, <MILESTONE N="40"> and Soldiers, the City beat a Parley; which the Prince willingly embracing, and getting their Ho&s;tages into his hands, &s;ent Colonel <HI>Ger|rard</HI> and another Officer to the Governour to Treat.

<P>THE next morning, if not before (for the truth is, from the time that the Treaty was fir&s;t offer'd, they in the Town kept no Guards, nor ob|&s;erv'd any order; but Their Soldiers run away to the Prince, and many of His Soldiers went into the Town) his Highne&s;s was po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> the Enemy then marching away. Here the ill example of <HI>Reading,</HI> in the breach of the Articles, was remember'd, and unhappily followed; for all that Garri&s;on was now here. So that they, with &s;ome Colour of right, or retaliation, and the re&s;t, by Their example, u&s;ed great Licence to the Soldiers, who &s;hould have been &s;afely conducted; which reflected much upon the Prince, though he u&s;ed his utmo&s;t power to &s;uppre&s;s it; and charged Colonel <HI>Fiennes</HI> to be acce&s;&s;ary to his own wrong, by march|ing out of the Town an hour before his appointment; and thereby his Convoy was not ready; and at another Gate, than was appointed and agreed on. And as the Articles were thus unhappily violated to tho&s;e who went away, &s;o they were not enough ob&s;erv'd to tho&s;e who &s;tayed, and to the City it &s;elf: for many of Colonel <HI>Fiennes</HI> Soldiers taking conditions, and entering with the King's Army, in&s;tructed their new

<P>THIS reduction of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was a full tide of pro&s;perity to the King, and made him Ma&s;ter of the &s;econd City of his Kingdom, and gave him the undi&s;turbed po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of one of the riche&s;t Counties of the Kingdom (for the Rebels had now no &s;tanding Garri&s;on, or the lea&s;t vi&s;ible in|fluence upon any part of <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire)</HI> and render'd <HI>Wales</HI> (which was before well affected, except &s;ome Towns in <HI>Pembroke-&s;hire)</HI> more u&s;e|ful <MILESTONE N="2$"> to him; being freed of the fear of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and con&s;equently of the charge, that allways attends tho&s;e fears; and re&s;tored to the Trade with <HI>Bristol;</HI> which was the greate&s;t &s;upport of tho&s;e parts.

<P>UPON the News of the Lord <HI>Fairfax</HI>'s being Defeated in the North, which came about this time, <Q>they re&s;olv'd to &s;end a Committee of the two Hou&s;es into <HI>Scotland,</HI> &startq;to de&s;ire their Brethren of that Kingdom,&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The two Hou&s;es &s;end Commi&s;&s;ioners into</HI> Scotland <HI>for relief.</HI></NOTE> pre&s;ently to advance with an Army for their relief;</Q> which was thought &s;o de&s;perate a Cure, that the Lords naming the Earl of <HI>Rutland,</HI> and Lord <HI>Grey</HI> of <HI>Warke,</HI> for that Emba&s;&s;y, the Earl upon indi&s;po&s;ition of Health procured a relea&s;e; and the other, who had never declined any employment they would confer on him, &s;o peremptorily refu&s;ed to <MILESTONE N="$$"> meddle in it, that he was committed to the Tower; and in the end, they were compelled to depute only Commoners to that Service: and &s;o S^r <HI>William Armyne,</HI> young S^r <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> and two more, a&s;&s;i&s;ted with M^r <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> and M^r <HI>Nye,</HI> two of their powerful Clergy, were imbarked in that negotiation; upon which, they who &s;ent them, were &s;o far from being confident, and &s;o little &s;atisfied, that they &s;hould be driven to bring in Forreign Forces, with the purpo&s;e whereof they had &s;o long traduced the King, that there was, &s;ome few de&s;perate Per&s;ons only excepted, even a univer&s;al de&s;ire of Peace; <Q>and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Him|&s;elf, writing to the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, of the defects <MILESTONE N="2$"> in his Army, and of his wants of Hor&s;e, Men, and Money, advi&s;ed, &startq;that they would think of &s;ending &s;ome rea&s;onable Propo&s;itions to the King,&endq; for the procuring a &s;afe Peace;</Q> which being the fir&s;t intimation, he had ever given to that purpo&s;e, together with his familiarity, and cor|re&s;pondence with tho&s;e Lords, who were known pa&s;&s;ionately to de&s;ire an accommodation, gave them &s;ad apprehen&s;ions; which were encrea&s;ed by &s;ome &s;evere Me&s;&s;ages they receiv'd from him, for his vindication from the foul a&s;per&s;ions, and calumnies, which were generally and publickly laid on him, for his unactivity after the winning <HI>Reading,</HI> whil&s;t the Queen march'd &s;ecurely to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> was de&s;troyed; <Q>as if &startq;he would think of &s;ome way of righting Him&s;elf,&endq; if They were not &s;en&s;ible on His behalf.</Q></P>
<P>HOW to work upon the&s;e di&s;compo&s;ed humours, and to reduce them to &s;uch temper, that they might con&s;ent to the Kingdoms Peace, was the Argument of the King's con&s;ultations: but by what expedient to promote this, was the Difficulty. After the breach of the la&s;t Treaty, and when the King had in vain labour'd to revive it, and could not pro|cure any An&s;wer from them to his la&s;t Me&s;&s;ages; <Q>but in&s;tead thereof his Me&s;&s;enger impri&s;on'd, tryed before a Council of War for his Life, and &s;till in cu&s;tody, and a Declaration, &startq;that who&s;oever &s;hould be em|ployed <MILESTONE N="40"> by his Maje&s;ty, on any Me&s;&s;age to them, without Their leave,&endq; &s;hould be proceeded again&s;t as a Spy (&s;o that though they pretended to be his great Council,</Q> they upon the matter now prote&s;ted again&s;t any relation to his Maje&s;ty) he advi&s;ed with his Council, <Q>&startq;what might be fit for him to do, to le&s;&s;en the Reverence and Reputation of them with&endq; the People:</Q> for the &s;uper&s;tition towards the name of a Parliament was &s;o general, that the King had wi&s;ely forborne to charge the two Hou&s;es with the Trea&s;on, and Rebellion which was rai&s;ed, but imputed it to particular Per&s;ons, <Q>who were mo&s;t vi&s;ibly and actually engaged in it.

We de&s;ired to add any thing, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Religion, Laws, and Liberty of the Kingdom.

<P>WHAT effect this Declaration produced, at lea&s;t what accident fell out &s;hortly after the publi&s;hing it, We &s;hall have occa&s;ion anon to re|member, when We have fir&s;t remember'd &s;ome unfortunate Pa&s;&s;ages, which accompanied this pro&s;perity on the King's part; for the Sun&s;hine of his Conque&s;t was &s;omewhat clouded, not only by the Number and Quality of the &s;lain, but by the jealou&s;ies and mi&s;under&s;tandings of tho&s;e who were alive. There was not, from the beginning, that confor|mity <MILESTONE N="20"> of humour and inclinations between the Princes and the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> as had been to be wi&s;h'd between all Per&s;ons of Honour, who were engaged in a Quarrel that could never pro&s;per but by the Union of the Undertakers. Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> and, on his behalf (or ra|ther the other by his impul&s;ion) Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> taking to heart, that a Nephew of the King's &s;hould be Lieutenant General to the Marquis, who had neither been exerci&s;ed in the profe&s;&s;ion of a Soldier, nor even now punctually &s;tudied the Office of a General: On the other hand, the Marquis, who was of the mo&s;t gentle Nature to the gentle, and as rough and re&s;olute to the imperious, it may be liked not the Princes a&s;&s;uming <MILESTONE N="30"> to him&s;elf more than became a Lieutenant General, and &s;ometimes cro&s;&s;ing Acts of his with relation to the governing, and di&s;po&s;ing the Affairs of the Country, in which he knew him&s;elf better ver&s;ed than the Prince; and when <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was taken, where the Marquis took him&s;elf <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Jealou&s;ies ari&s;e among the King's principal Offi|cers about the Government of</HI> Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> to Command in Chief, being a Town particularly within his Commi&s;&s;ion, and of which he was be&s;ides Lord Lieutenant, he thought him&s;elf not regardfully enough u&s;ed, that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had not only enter'd into the Treaty without His advice, but concluded the Articles without &s;o much as naming him, or taking notice that he was there. And there|fore with as little ceremony to his Highne&s;s, or &s;o much as communi|cating <MILESTONE N="40"> it to either of the Princes, the Marquis declared that he would give the Government of that City to S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton.</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> on the other hand conceiv'd the Town wone by him, being enter'd on that &s;ide in which he Commanded ab&s;olutely, and the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> on the other part ab&s;olutely repul&s;ed; and therefore that the di&s;po&s;ition of the Command and Government of it, wholely belonged to him. But when he heard the re&s;olution of the Marquis concerning S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> who was not to be put into the Scale with any private Man, he gave over the de&s;ign of conferring it upon any of the pretenders; and by the &s;ame Me&s;&s;enger, by whom he adverti&s;ed his Maje&s;ty of the good &s;uc|ce&s;s, <Q>he de&s;ired, &startq;that he would be&s;tow the Government of that City&endq; reduced by him, upon him&s;elf;</Q> the which the King readily con&s;ented to; not &s;u&s;pecting any di&s;pute to be about it.

<P>THEN, and not before, the King under&s;tood what &s;treight he was in; and was exceedingly perplexed to find an Expedient to compo&s;e the dif|ference that he &s;aw would ari&s;e. He had pa&s;&s;ed his word to his Nephew, of whom he was very tender, and did in truth believe that his Title to di&s;po&s;e the Government was very ju&s;t: he had likewi&s;e a very ju&s;t e&s;teem of the Marquis, who had &s;erv'd him with all fidelity, and had clearly declared him&s;elf for him, when the doing otherwi&s;e would have been <MILESTONE N="10"> mo&s;t prejudicial to his Maje&s;ty: and, it could not be denied, no Subject's Affection and Loyalty gave a greater Lu&s;tre to the King's Cau&s;e, than that of the Marquis; and that which was a circum&s;tance of infinite Moment, was the nominating S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton;</HI> who as he was a Per|&s;on of high merit from the King, &s;o he was the mo&s;t gracious and po|pular to that City, and the Country adjacent; and after &s;o great &s;ervice, and &s;uffering in the &s;ervice, to expo&s;e him to a refu&s;al, was both again&s;t the kindne&s;s and goodne&s;s of the King's Nature, and h$$ Politick fore|&s;ight into his Affairs. And as a pre&s;age how various the interpretation would be abroad, of what&s;oever he &s;hould determine, he found the <MILESTONE N="20"> Minds and Affections of his own Court and Council, with more pa&s;&s;ion than ordinary, ready to deliver their opinions. The Marquis was ge|nerally lov'd, and where he was not enough known to be &s;o, his Intere&s;t and Reputation in the Kingdom was thought of wonderful con&s;idera|tion in the King's bu&s;ine&s;s: and many were very much troubled to &s;ee Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who&s;e Activity and Courage in the Field they thought very in&s;trumental, incline to get the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the &s;econd City of the Kingdom into his hands, or to engage him&s;elf &s;o much in the Civil Government, as &s;uch a Command &s;oberly executed mu&s;t nece&s;&s;arily comprehend; and this as it were in contempt of one of the prime Noble <MILESTONE N="30"> Men of the Kingdom, to which Order the Prince had not expre&s;s'd him|&s;elf very debonair. <Q>And the&s;e thought &startq;the King was, by Coun&s;el and Precept, to reform and &s;often the Prince's under&s;tanding and humour; and to per&s;wade him, in compliance with his Service, to decline the Conte&s;t, and &s;uffer the Marquis to proceed in his di&s;po&s;ition, which,&endq; on all parts, was acknowledged to be mo&s;t fitly de&s;ign'd.</Q></P>
<P><Q>OTHERS again were of opinion, &startq;that the right of di&s;po&s;ing the Command to whom&s;oever he thought fit, entirely belonged to Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> and therefore (be&s;ides that the King had, by the &s;ame Me&s;&s;en|ger who brought the Suit, return'd his Con&s;ent) that he could not be <MILESTONE N="40"> rea&s;onably refu&s;ed, when he de&s;ired it for him&s;elf; which would take away all po&s;&s;ible imagination of di&s;re&s;pect to S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> who could not take it ill, that the Prince him&s;elf had taken a Command, that was de&s;ign'd to Him: That the Eyes of the Army were upon his Highne&s;s, who&s;e name was grown a terror to the Enemy, as his Cou|rage and Conduct had been very pro&s;perous to the King; and if, after &s;o happy and glorious an atchievement, he &s;hould now receive a re|pul&s;e in &s;o rea&s;onable a pretence, though it would not le&s;&s;en his own duty or alacrity in the Service, it might have an unhappy influence upon his Reputation and Intere&s;t in the Army; which could receive no diminution without apparent damage to his Maje&s;ty: and therefore, that &s;ome means &s;hould be u&s;ed to the Marquis, to wave his Title,&endq; and to con&s;ent that the Prince &s;hould enjoy his de&s;ires:</Q> &s;o that they
<PB N="238" REF="2800">
who were only fit to be employed to per&s;wade and alter either, Seem'd, and indeed Were, pa&s;&s;ionately engaged again&s;t the thing they were to per&s;wade. Whereupon the King di&s;cern'd that all depended upon his own Royal Wi&s;dom; and therefore re&s;olv'd to take a Journey in his own Per&s;on to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and there to give &s;uch a Rule as he &s;hould find mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary; to which, he pre&s;umed, both Per&s;ons would conform them|&s;elves, as well cordially, as obediently.</P>
<P>THAT which the King propo&s;ed to him&s;elf, was to gratify his Ne|phew <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes to</HI> Bri&s;tol <HI>to compo&s;e the difference.</HI></NOTE> with the Name, and the Marquis, by making S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> enjoy the Thing; upon obliging whom the King's care was very parti|cular. For though he knew his nature, as in truth it was, mo&s;t exactly free from interrupting the lea&s;t publick Service by private ends or thoughts, other Men would be apt to conceive and publi&s;h a di&s;re&s;pect to be done to him, which him&s;elf apprehended not; and therefore his Maje&s;ty was not only, in his own Princely mind, to retain a very gra|cious &s;en&s;e of his Service, but to give Evidence to all Men, that he did &s;o. And &s;o after he had made a joyful entrance into <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which was perform'd with all decent Solemnity, and u&s;ed all kind and obliging ex|pre&s;&s;ions to the Marquis, he de&s;ired him in private to con&s;ent, that he might perform his promi&s;e to his Nephew, which he had pa&s;&s;ed before <MILESTONE N="$$"> he had any imagination that his Lord&s;hip otherwi&s;e had determin'd of it; without &s;peaking at all of any other Title his Highne&s;s had to it, but by his Maje&s;ties promi&s;e. He e&s;tabli&s;h'd Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> in the Go|vernment of <HI>Bristol,</HI> who immediately &s;ent a Commi&s;&s;ion to S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton</HI> (who was now &s;o well recover'd, that he walked into the Air) to be his Lieutenant Governour; <Q>&s;ignifying likewi&s;e to him, by a Con|fident that pa&s;&s;ed between them, &startq;that though he was now engaged for &s;ome time, which &s;hould not be long, to keep the Superior Title him|&s;elf, he would not at all meddle in the Government, but that he &s;hould be as ab&s;olute in it, as if the Original Commi&s;&s;ion had been granted&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> to Him.</Q></P>
<P>S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> who was exceedingly &s;orry that His name was at all u&s;ed, and expo&s;ed, as an Argument of difference and mi&s;under&s;tanding between Per&s;ons of &s;uch eminent influence upon the publick, quickly di&s;cern'd that this expedient, though it &s;eem'd plau&s;ibly to le&s;&s;en the noi&s;e of the Debate, did in truth object him to the full Envy of one Par|ty. For the Marquis (who by the King's per&s;wa&s;ions was rather quieted, than &s;atisfied) might, and he fore&s;aw would, be per&s;waded to expect that he would refu&s;e the Commi&s;&s;ion from Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> both, as he might be thought to comply in an Injury done to the Marquis, to whom <MILESTONE N="40"> his devotion had been ancient, fa&s;t, and un&s;haken, and as the Command now given him, was inferior to what the Marquis, who had the power of di&s;po&s;al, had conferr'd on him; and &s;o that he &s;hould vindicate the Title, which the King him&s;elf was loath to give a judgement upon. He was the more troubled, becau&s;e he found that by &s;ubmitting to this Charge, he &s;hould by &s;ome be thought to have de&s;erted the Marquis out of a kind of Revenge for his having de&s;erted the Enterpri&s;e, when he cho&s;e, the la&s;t year, rather to go into <HI>Wales</HI> than <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and for his de&s;erting him again now, when he brought all new Officers to Com|mand the Army over Their heads who had rai&s;ed it, and made the way <MILESTONE N="50"> for the new to come to them. Whereas the fir&s;t, as is before remem|ber'd, was done by his own advice, as well as his full con&s;ent; and the latter, he well knew, was rather to be imputed to Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> than
<PB N="239" REF="2810">
to his Lord&s;hip, who&s;e kindne&s;s and e&s;teem had been ever very real to him. On the other hand, he &s;aw plainly, that if he refu&s;ed to receive this Commi&s;&s;ion, with what &s;pecious Circum&s;tances of Duty and Sub|mi&s;&s;ion &s;oever, it might produce (as without doubt unavoidably it would) notable di&s;turbances and interruptions in the King's Affairs; and that the Marquis, to common under&s;tandings, had, to obey the King, declined the Conte&s;t, and therefore that the reviving it, and the mi&s;chief that attended it, would be imputed to his particular Account. Be&s;ides that, he had allways borne an avow'd and declar'd Reverence to the Queen of <HI>Bohemia</HI> and her Children, whom he had per&s;onally and <MILESTONE N="10"> actively &s;erved in their Wars, whil&s;t they maintain'd any, and for who&s;e Honour and Re&s;titution he had been a Zealous and known Champion. And therefore he had no inclination to di&s;oblige a hopeful Prince of that Hou&s;e, upon whom our own hopes &s;eem'd &s;o much to depend. He therefore re&s;olv'd, according to his rare temper throughout this War, to let him whom he profe&s;s'd to &s;erve, choo&s;e in what kind he would be &s;erv'd by him; and chearfully receiv'd the Commi&s;&s;ion from Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> upon which, all di&s;cour&s;e, or debate of difference, was for the pre&s;ent determin'd, what whi&s;perings or murmurings &s;o$ver remain'd.</P>
<P>THE King found it now high time to re&s;olve, to what Action next <MILESTONE N="$0"> to di&s;po&s;e his Armies, and that their lying &s;till &s;o long there (for the&s;e Agitations had kept the main work from going forward ten or twelve days, a time in that Sea&s;on unfortunately lo&s;t) had more weaken'd, than refre&s;h'd them; having not lo&s;t more Men by &s;torming the City, than afterwards by plundering it: tho&s;e Soldiers, who had warm'd them&s;elves with the burthen of Pillage, never quietly again &s;ubmitting to the Car|riage of their Armes.</P>
<P><Q>THE Que&s;tion was fir&s;t, &startq;whether both Armies &s;hould be united,&endq; and march in one, upon the next De&s;ign?</Q> and then, <Q>&startq;What that De|&s;ign&endq; &s;hould be? Again&s;t the Fir&s;t, there were many Allegations.</Q> <MILESTONE N="$$"></P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>&startq;THE condition of the We&s;t: <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Devon-&s;hire</HI> were entirely po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Enemy; for though S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> with a daring Party kept <HI>Exeter,</HI> and Colonel <HI>John Digby</HI> the North part (which was notoriou&s;ly di&s;affected) from joyning with <HI>Plymouth,</HI> which would el&s;e quickly have grown into an Army &s;trong enough to infe&s;t <HI>Cornwal,</HI> yet they had no place to retire to upon di&s;tre&s;s; and all the Ports upon the We&s;tern Coa&s;ts were Garri&s;on'd by the Parlia|ment, which, upon the fame of the approach of the King's Forces, and the lo&s;s of <HI>Bristol,</HI> might probably be, without much re&s;i&s;tance,&endq; <MILESTONE N="$0"> reduced.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>&startq;THE <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Army was greater in Reputation, than Numbers; having lo&s;t many at <HI>Lan&s;down,</HI> and the A&s;&s;ault of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and, by the death of their Chief Officers, very many were run away &s;ince: be&s;ides they pretended &s;ome promi&s;e made to their Country (which they conceiv'd not to be enough &s;ecured again&s;t <HI>Plymouth)</HI> of return|ing &s;peedily for the reduction of that Town; &s;o that if they were com|pelled to march Ea&s;twards, to which they were not inclined, it was to be doubted they would moulder away &s;o fa&s;t, that there would be little addition of &s;trength by it. Whereas if they march'd We&s;tward, it would be no hard matter to gather up tho&s;e who were return'd, and to be &s;trong enough in a very &s;hort time, by new Levies, for any En|terpri&s;e&endq; &s;hould be thought rea&s;onable to be undertaken.</Q> <Q>To which was added, &startq;that having lo&s;t tho&s;e Officers, whom they lov'd and fear'd;
<PB N="240" REF="2820">
and who&s;e Reverence re&s;train'd their Natural di&s;tempers, they were too much inclined to mutiny; and had expre&s;s'd a peremptory aver|&s;ion&endq; to the joyning, and marching with the King's Army.</Q> And the truth is, their humours then were not very gentle and agreeable, as be|ing apt to think that their prowe&s;s was not enough recompenced, or va|lued. For though the King affected to make all po&s;&s;ible demon&s;trations to them, of an extraordinary high e&s;teem he had of their wonderful Fi|delity and Courage, yet he was able to procure very little Money for them; and they had then, by the di&s;cipline under which they had been train'd (which was mo&s;t regular, and full of that &s;obriety which pro|mi&s;ed <MILESTONE N="10"> good fortune) an hone&s;t pride in their own Natures, a great di&s;|dain of plundering, or &s;upplying them&s;elves by tho&s;e vile Arts, which they grew afterwards le&s;s tender to avoid.</P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>&startq;THE great number of the King's Hor&s;e; which was &s;o brave a Body, that when that part of it, which was joyn'd to the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> was away, he &s;hould march with at lea&s;t &s;ix thou&s;and Hor&s;e, which were as many as would be able to live on any Country within a due di&s;tance&endq; of Quartering.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. <Q>&startq;LASTLY, &s;ome Corre&s;pondence with the Chief Gentlemen of <HI>Dor|&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> who were ready to joyn with any con&s;iderable Party for the <MILESTONE N="20"> King, and had &s;ome probable hopes, that the &s;mall Garri&s;ons upon&endq; the Coa&s;t would not make a tedious re&s;i&s;tance.</Q></P>
<P>THERE was another rea&s;on, which was not given, that if both Ar|mies had been kneaded into one, Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> could have been but a private Colonel: but there were enough be&s;ides to &s;atisfy the King to keep them divided; and &s;o he gave Order to the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon</HI> to advance towards <HI>Dorchester</HI> (the Chief Town in that County, and one of the mo&s;t malignant in <HI>England,</HI> where the Rebels had a Garri&s;on) with the Hor&s;e and Dragoons, and the next day to Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Mau|rice <HI>&s;ent into the We&s;t with an Army.</HI></NOTE> march after with the Foot and Cannon; his Maje&s;ty keeping with him <MILESTONE N="30"> the Marquis of <HI>Hertford</HI> to attend his own Per&s;on; for though he well &s;aw, he &s;hould undergo &s;ome Inconveniences by withdrawing the Mar|quis from that employment, the opinion of the Soundne&s;s of his Reli|gion, and Integrity of his Ju&s;tice, rendring him by much the mo&s;t po|pular Man in tho&s;e parts, and was exceedingly tender of giving the lea&s;t umbrage and di&s;ta&s;te to his Lord&s;hip, upon who&s;e Honour and Affection he relied entirely, and would a&s;&s;oon have tru&s;ted his Crown upon His Fidelity, as upon any Man's in his three Kingdoms, yet he di&s;cern'd plainly that the Prince and the Marquis would never agree together; and that there were Per&s;ons about them, who would foment their In|di&s;po&s;itions <MILESTONE N="4$"> to each other, with any hazard to His &s;ervice; and con|cluded, that he &s;hould &s;ooner reduce his People by the Power of his Army, than by the per&s;wa&s;ions of his Coun&s;el; and that the roughne&s;s of the one's Nature, might prevail more than the lenity and conde&s;cen|&s;ion of the other: and therefore he &s;ent the Prince on that employ|ment; u&s;ing all imaginable means to remove any trouble, or jealou&s;y of his favour from the Marquis's mind; his Maje&s;ty freely and clearly communicating to him all his Coun&s;els, and the true grounds of his Re|&s;olution; and declaring to him, <Q>&startq;that he would make him a Gentleman of his Bed-Chamber, and Groom of his Stole, and that he would all|ways&endq; have his Company and Advice about him;</Q> with which the Mar|quis was &s;atisfied; rather becau&s;e he re&s;olv'd not to di&s;obey him, than that he was well plea&s;ed with the price of the obligations.</P>
<P><PB N="241" REF="2830">
AND truly many wi&s;e and hone&s;t Men, were &s;orry for the King's Election; and though the Marquis's years, and a long indulgence to his ea&s;e, had &s;uperinduced a kind of lazine&s;s and inactivity upon his Na|ture, that was neither agreeable to his primitive Con&s;titution, nor the great Endowments of his mind (for he was a good Scholar, and had a good judgement) and le&s;s to the temper of this time, and the Office of a General, in&s;omuch, as he often re&s;ign'd an excellent under&s;tanding to tho&s;e who had a very indifferent one, and follow'd the advice, and con|cluded upon the information of tho&s;e, who had narrower, and more vulgar thoughts than &s;uited with his Honour, and were not worthy of <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;uch a Tru&s;t; yet they thought the Prince's inexperience of the Cu&s;toms and Manners of <HI>England,</HI> and an aver&s;ion from con&s;idering them, mu&s;t &s;ubject him to the information and advice of wor&s;e Coun&s;ellors than the other, and which would not be &s;o ea&s;ily controuled: And I am of opi|nion, that if the Prince had waited on his Maje&s;ty in that Army, and never interpo&s;ed in any Command, not purely Martial, and the Mar|quis been &s;ent with tho&s;e Forces into the We&s;t with the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> (who was now to be left at <HI>Bristol</HI> to intend his health, and to form that new Garri&s;on; which was to be a Magazine for Men, Armes, Ammu|nition, and all that was wanted) and &s;ome other &s;teady Per&s;ons, who <MILESTONE N="20"> might have been A&s;&s;ign'd to &s;pecial Provinces, a greater tide of good fortune had attended that expedition.</P>
<P>THE next re&s;olution to be taken, was concerning the King's own motion with the other Army. There was not a Man, who did not think the reducing of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> a City within little more than twenty miles of <HI>Bristol,</HI> of mighty importance to the King, if it might be done with|out a great expence of time, and lo&s;s of Men: <Q>&startq;It was the only Gar|ri&s;on the Rebels had between <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> on the North part of <HI>England,</HI> and if it could be recover'd, his Maje&s;ty would have the River of <HI>Severn</HI> entirely within his Command; whereby his Gar|ri&s;ons <MILESTONE N="30"> of <HI>Worcester,</HI> and <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and all tho&s;e parts, might be &s;upplied from <HI>Bristol;</HI> and the Trade of that City thereby &s;o advanced, that the Cu&s;toms and Duty might bring a notable Revenue to the King, and the Wealth of the City encrea&s;ing, it might bear the greater Burthen for the War: A rich and populous County, which hitherto rather yeilded Conveniences of Quarter, than a &s;ettled Contribution (that &s;trong Garri&s;on holding not only the whole Forre&s;t divi&s;ion, which is a fourth part of the County of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> ab&s;olutely in obedience, but &s;o alarm'd all other parts, that none of the Gentry, who for the mo&s;t part were well affected, dur&s;t &s;tay at their own Hou&s;es) might be <MILESTONE N="40"> wholely the King's Quarters, and by how much it had offended, and di&s;quieted the King, more than other Counties, by &s;o much the more&endq; Money might be rai&s;ed upon them.</Q> Be&s;ides the General weekly Con|tributions, the Yeomanry, who had been mo&s;t forward and &s;editious, being very wealthy, and able to redeem their Delinquency at a high Price (and the&s;e Arguments were fully pre&s;s'd by the well affected Gen|try of the County, who had carried them&s;elves hone&s;tly, and &s;uffer'd very much by doing &s;o, and undertook great Levies of Men, if this Work were fir&s;t done) there was another Argument of no le&s;s, if not greater Moment than all the re&s;t: <Q>&startq;If <HI>Gloucester</HI> were reduced, there <MILESTONE N="50"> would need no Forces to be left in <HI>Wales,</HI> and all tho&s;e Soldiers might be then drawn to the marching Army, and the Contributions and&endq; other Taxes a&s;&s;ign'd to the payment of it.</Q> Indeed the King would
<PB N="242" REF="2840">
have had a glorious, and entire part of his Kingdom, to have contended with the re&s;t.</P>
<P>YET all the&s;e motives were not thought worth the engaging his Ar|my in a doubtful Siege; whil&s;t the Parliament might both recover the fear that was upon them, and con&s;equently allay and compo&s;e the di&s;tem|pers (which, if they did not wholely proceed from, were very much &s;trengthen'd by tho&s;e fears) and recruit their Army; and therefore that it was better to march into &s;ome of tho&s;e Counties which were mo&s;t op|pre&s;s'd by the Enemy, and there wait &s;uch advantage, as the di&s;traction in and about <HI>London</HI> would admini&s;ter, except there could be &s;ome pro|bable <MILESTONE N="10"> hope that <HI>Gloucester</HI> might be got without much delay. And to that purpo&s;e there had been &s;ecret agitation, the effect whereof was hourly expected. The Governour of that Garri&s;on was one Colonel <HI>Ma&s;&s;y,</HI> a Soldier of Fortune, who had, in the late Northern Expedi|tions prepared by the King again&s;t <HI>Scotland,</HI> been an Officer in the King's Army, under the Command of Colonel <HI>William Leg;</HI> and, in the be|ginning of the&s;e Troubles, had been at <HI>York</HI> with inclination to &s;erve the King; but finding him&s;elf not enough known there, and that there would be little gotten, but the Comfort of a good Con&s;cience, he went to <HI>London,</HI> where there was more Money, and fewer Officers; and was <MILESTONE N="20"> ea&s;ily made Lieutenant Colonel to the Earl of <HI>Stamford;</HI> and being quickly found to be a diligent and &s;tout Officer, and of no ill parts of Conver&s;ation to render him&s;elf acceptable among the Common People, was by his Lord&s;hip, when he went into the We&s;t, left Governour of that City of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> where he had behaved him&s;elf actively, and &s;ucce&s;sfully. There was no rea&s;on to de&s;pair, that this Man (not intoxi|cated with any of tho&s;e fumes, which made Men rave, and frantick in the Cau&s;e) might not be wrought upon. And <HI>Will. Leg,</HI> who had the good opinion of mo&s;t Men, and the particular kindne&s;s of Prince <HI>Ru|pert,</HI> had &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger, who was like to pa&s;s without &s;u&s;picion to <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Gloucester,</HI> with &s;uch a Letter of kindne&s;s and overture to <HI>Ma&s;&s;y,</HI> as was proper in &s;uch a ca&s;e from one Friend to another. This Me&s;&s;enger re|turn'd when the King's and the Army's motion was under Debate, and brought an An&s;wer from the Governour to Colonel <HI>Leg,</HI> in a very high Style, <Q>and &s;eeming to take it much unkindly, &startq;that he &s;hould endea|vour to Corrupt him in his Hone&s;ty, and Fidelity, and to per&s;wade him&endq; to break a Tru&s;t, which, to &s;ave his Life, he would never do;</Q> <Q>with much di&s;cour&s;e &startq;of his Honour, and Reputation, which would be all|ways&endq; dear to him.</Q> <Q>But the Me&s;&s;enger &s;aid withall, &startq;that, after the Go|vernour had given him this Letter, and &s;ome &s;harp Reproaches before <MILESTONE N="40"> Company, he was brought again, a back way, to a place where the&endq; Governour was by him&s;elf;</Q> <Q>and then he told him, &startq;that it was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary he &s;hould write &s;uch an An&s;wer as he had done; which was communicated to tho&s;e, who el&s;e would have been jealous what &s;uch a Me&s;&s;enger &s;hould come to him about; but that he &s;hould tell <HI>Will.

THIS Me&s;&s;age turn'd the Scale; for though it might be without pur|po&s;e of being hone&s;t, yet there was no great objection again&s;t the King's marching that way with his Army; &s;ince it would be &s;till in his power to pur&s;ue any other Coun&s;el, without engaging before it.

</LETTER>
<P>THIS Paper was &s;ub&s;cribed by <HI>Wi&s;e</HI> the Mayor, and <HI>Ma&s;&s;y</HI> the Go|vernour, <MILESTONE N="10"> with thirteen of the Aldermen, and mo&s;t &s;ub&s;tantial Citizens, and eleven Officers of the Garri&s;on; and a&s;&s;oon as their Me&s;&s;engers re|turn'd, who were quickly di&s;m&s;s'd, without attending to &s;ee what the King re&s;olv'd, all the Suburbs of the City, in which were very large and fair buildings, well inhabited, were &s;et on fire; &s;o that there was no doubt, the King was to expect nothing there but what could not be kept from him. Now was the time for new Debates, and new Re&s;olutions; to which Men came not &s;o unbia&s;&s;ed, or un&s;wayed, as they had been at <HI>Bristol.</HI> This indignity and affront to the King prompted thoughts of <MILESTONE N="20"> Revenge; and &s;ome thought the King &s;o far engaged, that in Honour he could not do le&s;s, than &s;it down before the Town, and force it: and the&s;e Inclinations gave Countenance, <Q>and Credit to all tho&s;e plau&s;ible informations &startq;of &s;mall Provi&s;ions in the Town, either of Victual, or Ammunition; that, where the Town was &s;tronge&s;t, there was nothing but an old Stone Wall, which would fall upon an ea&s;y Battery; that there were many well affected People in the Town, who, with tho&s;e who were incen&s;ed by the burning of the Suburbs, and the great lo&s;&s;es they mu&s;t &s;u&s;tain thereby, would make &s;uch a Party, that a&s;&s;oon as&endq; they were di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, the &s;editious Party would be forced to yeild.</Q> <Q>It <MILESTONE N="30"> was alledged, &startq;that the Enemy had no Army; nor, by all Intelligence, was like to form any &s;oon enough to be able to relieve it; and if they had an Army, that it was much better for his Maje&s;ty to force them to that di&s;tance from <HI>London,</HI> and to fight there, where he could be &s;upplied with what&s;oever he wanted, could choo&s;e his own ground, where his brave Body of Hor&s;e would be able to Defeat any Army they&endq; could rai&s;e, than to &s;eek them in their own Quarters.</Q></P>
<P>ABOVE all, the confidence of the Soldiers of the be&s;t experience moved his Maje&s;ty; who upon riding about the Town, and taking a near view of it, were clear of opinion, that they &s;hould be able in le&s;s <MILESTONE N="40"> than ten days by Approach, for all thoughts of Storming was laid a&s;ide upon the lo&s;s at <HI>Bristol,</HI> to win it. This produced a Re&s;olution in his Maje&s;ty, not one Man in the Council of War di&s;&s;wading it. <Q>So the King pre&s;ently &s;ent to <HI>Oxford</HI> for his General the Earl of <HI>Brentford</HI> &startq;to come to him, with all the Foot that could be &s;pared out of that Garri&s;on,&endq; and his pieces of Battery, to govern that Action:</Q> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> wi&s;ely declining that Province, and retiring him&s;elf into the General&s;hip of the Hor&s;e, that he might not be thought accountable for any Accidents which &s;hould attend that Service. At the &s;ame in&s;tant, Orders were di&s;patched to S^r <HI>William Vava&s;our,</HI> who Commanded all the Forces in <MILESTONE N="50"> South <HI>Wales</HI> (the Lord <HI>Herbert</HI> having been per&s;waded, &s;o far to com|ply with the indi&s;po&s;ition of that People, <Q>as to decline that Command, or at lea&s;t for a time to di&s;&s;emble it) &startq;to draw all his Men to the Forre&s;t
<PB N="245" REF="2870">
&endq; &s;ide of the Town;</Q> where the Bridges being broken down, a &s;mall &s;trength would keep Them in, and any from going to them, which within two days was done. Thus the King was engaged before <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> and <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King Be|&s;ieges the Town.</NOTE> thereby gave re&s;pite to the di&s;tracted Spirits at <HI>London,</HI> to breath, and compo&s;e them&s;elves; and, more methodically than they had hoped to have done, to prepare for their pre&s;ervation, and accompli&s;hing their own ends; which at that time &s;eem'd allmo&s;t de&s;perate, and incurable.</P>
<P>THE direful News of the Surrender of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> which was brought to the two Hou&s;es on the 31^&s;^t of <HI>July,</HI> &s;truck them to the heart, and came upon them as a Sentence of Death, after a va&s;t Con&s;umption of <MILESTONE N="10"> Money, and confident promi&s;es of de&s;troying all the King's Forces by a day, every Tax and Impo&s;ition being declared to be the la&s;t; and for fini&s;hing the work, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was at the &s;ame time return'd to <HI>Kingston,</HI> within ten Miles of them, with his broken and di&s;mayed Troops, which him&s;elf would not endure &s;hould have the Title of an Army. So that the War &s;eem'd to be even at an end in a &s;en&s;e very contrary to what they had undertaken; their General talking more, and pre&s;&s;ing for reparation, and vindication of his Honour from imputations, and a&s;per&s;ions, than for a Recruit of Forces, or providing an Army to defend them. Every Man reproach'd his Neighbour with his want of <MILESTONE N="20"> inclination to Peace, when good conditions might be had, and magni|fied his own wi&s;dom, <Q>for having fear'd &startq;&endq; it would come to This.</Q> <Q>The King's la&s;t Declaration had been read by all Men, and was magnified &startq;as a mo&s;t gracious and undeniable in&s;tance of his Clemency and Ju&s;tice, that he was &s;o far from being elated with his good Succe&s;&s;es, and Power allmo&s;t to have what he would, that he renew'd all tho&s;e Promi&s;es, and Prote&s;tations for the Religion, Laws, and Liberties of the King|dom, and Priviledges of Parliament; which had been out of their per|ver&s;ne&s;s di&s;credited before, as proceeding from the low condition he was in; and whereas they had been frighted with their repre&s;entation <MILESTONE N="30"> of their own guilt, and the implacablene&s;s of the King's Nature, as if he meant an utter conque&s;t of them, his Maje&s;ty had now offer'd all that could be hone&s;tly de&s;ired, and had expre&s;s'd him&s;elf a Prince not delighted with blood and revenge, but an indulgent Father to the mo&s;t&endq; di&s;obedient Children.</Q> In this Reformation of Under&s;tanding, the Lords in their Hou&s;e debated nothing but expedients for Peace: there were not of that Body above five, at the mo&s;t, who had any inclination to continue the War; <Q>and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had &s;ufficiently declared, &startq;&endq; that He was weary of it,</Q> and held clo&s;e&s;t and &s;tricte&s;t Corre&s;pondence with tho&s;e who mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionately pre&s;&s;ed an Accommodation. So that, <MILESTONE N="40"> on the fifth of <HI>August,</HI> they de&s;ired a Conference with the Commons; <Q>and declared to them, &startq;that they were re&s;olv'd to &s;end Propo&s;itions to&endq; the King,</Q> and they hoped, They would concur in them: the parti|culars propo&s;ed by them were,</P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>&startq;THAT both Armies might be pre&s;ently disbanded, and his Ma|je&s;ty <NOTE PLACE="marg">Propo&s;itions for peace gi|ven by the Hou&s;e of Lords to the Hou&s;e of Com+mons in a Con|ference.</NOTE> be entreated to return to his Parliament, upon &s;uch &s;ecurity as&endq; &s;hould give him &s;atisfaction.</Q></P>

&s;uch hands as the King &s;hould appoint, with the approbation of both Hou&s;es of Parliament: and his Maje&s;ties Revenue to be ab&s;olutely, and wholely re&s;tored unto him; only deducting &s;uch part, as had been of nece&s;&s;ity expended for the maintenance of his Children, and not&endq; otherwi&s;e.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. <Q>&startq;THAT all the Members of both Hou&s;es who had been expelled only for ab&s;enting them&s;elves, or meer compliance with his Maje&s;ty, and no other matter of Fact again&s;t them, might be re&s;tored to their&endq; Places.</Q></P>
<P N="5">5. <Q>&startq;THAT all Delinquents, from before the tenth day of <HI>January</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> 1641, &s;hould be deliver'd up to the Ju&s;tice of Parliament, and a Ge|neral&endq; Pardon for all others on both &s;ides.</Q></P>
<P N="6">6. <Q>AND la&s;tly, that there might be an Act of Oblivion for all by|gone &startq;&endq; Deeds, and Acts of Ho&s;tility.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN this Conference was reported in the Hou&s;e of Commons, it begot a wonderful long, and a hot Debate, which la&s;ted till ten of the Clock that night, and continued a day or two more; the violent Party (for there were yet many among them of more moderate Con&s;titutions, who did, and ever had heartily abhorr'd their proceedings, though out <MILESTONE N="20"> of fear, and indi&s;po&s;ition of Health, or not knowing el&s;e well what to do, they continued there) inveighed furiou&s;ly again&s;t the de&s;ign it &s;elf of &s;ending to the King at all, and therefore would not have the parti|cular Propo&s;itions &s;o much as con&s;ider'd: <Q>&startq;They had receiv'd much pre|judice by the la&s;t Treaty at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and therefore mu&s;t undergo more now their condition was much lower: The King had &s;ince that, upon the matter, declared them to be no Parliament; for if they were not free, they could not be a Parliament; &s;o that till that point were vin|dicated, they could not Treat in any &s;afe Capacity, but would be look'd upon under the notion of Rebels, as his Maje&s;ty had declared them. <MILESTONE N="30"> They had &s;ent Members into <HI>Scotland</HI> to require A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which that Kingdom was preparing with all Brotherly affection, and forwardne&s;s, and after &s;uch a di&s;covery, to Treat for Peace, without the privity of the <HI>Scots,</HI> was to betray them; and to forfeit all hopes hereafter of re|lief from thence, what nece&s;&s;ities &s;oever they might be reduced to. That the City of <HI>London</HI> had expre&s;s'd all imaginable readine&s;s to rai&s;e Forces for S^$ <HI>William Waller;</HI> and the Counties near <HI>London</HI> were ready to ri&s;e as one Man, whereby the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> would be &s;peedily enabled to march, with a better Army than ever he had, to give the King Battle, except this di&s;cour&s;e of Peace did extingui&s;h the Zeal that&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> was then flaming in the hearts of the People.</Q></P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding the&s;e rea&s;ons, and the pa&s;&s;ion in the delivery, the terror of the King's Succe&s;&s;es &s;ugge&s;ted An&s;wers enough. <Q>&startq;They had been puni&s;h'd for breaking off the Treaty of <HI>Oxford,</HI> when they might have had better terms than now they could expect; and if they omitted this opportunity, they &s;hould fare much wor&s;e; that they were not &s;ure of aid from <HI>Scotland,</HI> neither was it allmo&s;t po&s;&s;ible it &s;hould come time enough to pre&s;erve them from the Ruin at hand. And for the City of <HI>London,</HI> though the common and meaner &s;ort of People, who might promi&s;e them&s;elves advantage by it, de&s;ired the <MILESTONE N="50"> continuance of the di&s;tractions, yet it was evident the mo&s;t Sub&s;tan|tial and Rich Men de&s;ired Peace, by their refu&s;al to &s;upply Money for the carrying on the War; and if they &s;hould judge of the Common
<PB N="247" REF="2890">
People by their forwardne&s;s to engage their own Per&s;ons, they had rea&s;on to believe they had no mind to the War neither; for their Ge|neral was forced to retire even under their own Walls, for want of Men to recruit his Army. However, the &s;ending rea&s;onable Propo&s;i|tions to the King, would either procure a Peace, and &s;o they &s;hould have no more need of an Army; or, being refu&s;ed, would rai&s;e more&endq; Men and Money than all their Ordinances without it.</Q> The&s;e rea&s;ons and arguments prevailed; and after the Debate had la&s;ted till ten of the Clock at night, it was re&s;olv'd upon the Que&s;tion, and carried by nine and twenty Voices, <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould in&s;i&s;t upon the Propo&s;itions, and&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;end to his Maje&s;ty.</Q></P>
<P>AND without doubt, if they had then &s;ent (as if the Power had been in the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, they had done) a firm Peace had im|mediately en&s;ued: For be&s;ides that if a Treaty and Ce&s;&s;ation had been in that Conjuncture enter'd upon, no extravagant demand would have been pre&s;&s;ed, only a &s;ecurity for tho&s;e who had been faulty, which the King would gladly have Granted, and mo&s;t Religiou&s;ly ob&s;erv'd; the fourth Propo&s;ition, and Con&s;ent to re&s;tore all Members to their places in Parliament, would have prevented the kindling any more fire in tho&s;e Hou&s;es. But this was too well known to be &s;uffer'd to pa&s;s; and there|fore <MILESTONE N="20"> the next day, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> <Q>the &s;editious Preachers filled all the Pulpits with Alarms of &startq;Ruin and De&s;truction to the City, if a Peace&endq; were now offer'd to the King;</Q> and printed Papers were &s;catter'd through the Streets, and fixed upon Gates, Po&s;ts, and the mo&s;t publick places in the City and Suburbs, <Q>requiring &startq;all Per&s;ons well affected, to ri&s;e as one Man, and to come to the Hou&s;e of Commons next morning; for that&endq; twenty thou&s;and <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebels were landed;</Q> which information was likewi&s;e given that day in many Pulpits by their Preachers; <Q>and in other Papers likewi&s;e &s;et up, it was declared, &startq;that the Malignant Party had&endq; over voted the Good, and if not prevented, there would be a Peace.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>WHEN the minds of the People were thus prepared, <HI>Pennington,</HI> their own Lord Mayor, though on <HI>Sunday</HI> (on which they before com|plain'd the King u&s;ed to &s;it in Council) called a Common Council; <Q>where a Petition was framed to the Hou&s;e of Commons, taking notice &startq;of Propo&s;itions pa&s;&s;ed by the Hou&s;e of Peers for Peace, which if con|&s;ented to, and allow'd, would be de&s;tructive to Religion, Laws, and Liberties; and therefore de&s;ired that Hou&s;e to pa&s;s an Ordinance, ac|cording&endq; to the Tenour of an Act of their Common Council (which they appointed to be annex'd to their Petition)</Q> <Q>&startq;which was for the vi|gorous pro&s;ecuting the War, and declining all thoughts of Accommo|dation.&endq;</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"> With this Petition, and &s;uch an Attendance as tho&s;e prepa|ratives <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Petition of the Common Council of</HI> London <HI>a|gain&s;t Peace:</HI></NOTE> were like to bring, the Lord Mayor him&s;elf, who, from the time of his Mayoralty, had forborne &s;itting in the Hou&s;e as a Member, came to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and deliver'd it, with &s;uch farther In&s;inua|tions of the temper of the City, as were fit for the purpo&s;e, <Q>the People at the door behaving them&s;elves as imperiou&s;ly, telling the Members of both Hou&s;es, as they pa&s;s'd by them, &startq;that if they had not a good An&s;wer,&endq; they would be there the next day with double the Number.</Q> The Lords complain'd of the Tumults, and &s;ent to the Commons to joyn with them in their Suppre&s;&s;ion; <Q>in&s;tead whereof the Commons (many of their Body <NOTE PLACE="marg">Whereupon the Hou&s;e of Commons re|jected the Pro|po&s;itions of the Lords.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="$0"> withdrawing for fear, and others by fear converted, or it may be by hope of prevailing) gave the City thanks &startq;for their Petition, Advice, and&endq; Courage; and rejected the Propo&s;itions for Peace.</Q></P>
<P><PB N="248" REF="2900">
THIS rai&s;ed a new conte&s;t in the City, which was not willing to lie under the perpetual brand of re&s;i&s;ting and oppo&s;ing Peace, as they did of fir&s;t rai&s;ing the War. And therefore the Wi&s;e and Sober part of it, would gladly have di&s;cover'd how aver&s;e they were from the late Act of the Common Council. But the late Execution of <HI>Tomkins,</HI> and <HI>Cha|loner,</HI> and the advantage which was pre&s;ently taken again&s;t any Man who was moderately inclined, frighted all Men from appearing in Per|&s;on to de&s;ire tho&s;e things, upon which their hearts were mo&s;t &s;et. In the end, the Women expre&s;s'd greater Courage than the Men; and having a Precedent of a Rabble of that Sex, appearing in the beginning <MILESTONE N="10"> of the&s;e Di&s;tractions with a Petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, to fo|ment the Divi&s;ions, with acceptance and approbation, a great Multi|tude of the Wives of Sub&s;tantial Citizens came to the Hou&s;e of Com|mons with a Petition for Peace. Thereupon a Troop of Hor&s;e, under the Command of one <HI>Harvey,</HI> a decayed Silk-man, who from the be|ginning had been one mo&s;t confided in, were &s;ent for; who behaved them&s;elves with &s;uch inhumanity, that they Charged among the &s;illy Women, as an Enemy worthy of their Courage, and killed, and wounded many of them, and ea&s;ily di&s;per&s;ed the re&s;t. When they were by this means &s;ecured from farther vexation of this kind, &s;pecial notice was <MILESTONE N="20"> taken of tho&s;e Members who &s;eem'd mo&s;t importunate, and de&s;irous of Peace, that &s;ome advantage might be taken again&s;t them. Whereupon, they well di&s;cerning the danger they were in, many both of the Peers, and the Commons, fir&s;t ab&s;ented them&s;elves from the Hou&s;es, and then remov'd into tho&s;e Quarters where they might enjoy the Protection of the King; and &s;ome of them came directly to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>HAVING diverted this Torrent, which would have brought Peace upon them before they were aware, they con&s;ider'd their &s;trength, and applied them&s;elves to the recovery of the Spirits of their General; who&s;e indi&s;po&s;ition troubled them more, than any other di&s;tre&s;s they were in. <MILESTONE N="30"> To this cure they applied remedies of contrary Natures, which would yet work to the &s;ame end.

<P>THE Violent Party carried now all before them; and were well con|tented with the ab&s;ence of tho&s;e who u&s;ed to give them &s;ome trouble, and vexation.

<P>THE fame of all the&s;e di&s;tractions and di&s;orders at <HI>London,</HI> exceed|ingly di&s;po&s;ed Men in all places to reproach his Maje&s;ties &s;tay before <HI>Gloucester;</HI> his Friends at <HI>London</HI> de&s;iring that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould march directly thither, to take the advantage of tho&s;e di&s;tractions; and the Lords of the Council at <HI>Oxford,</HI> upon the intelligence and advice from thence, were very &s;ollicitous that the King would take that re&s;olution, to which he was him&s;elf enough inclined. But his condition was be|liev'd to be, in both places, better than it was; and that he had now a victorious Army, without an Enemy to re&s;train his motion; whereas, <MILESTONE N="40"> in truth, his was a weak Army, le&s;&s;en'd exceedingly by the lo&s;&s;es it &s;u|&s;tain'd before <HI>Bristol;</HI> and when that part of it was march'd with Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> into the We&s;t, and which could not have march'd any other way, the King had not much above &s;ix thou&s;and Foot to march with, though he left none at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> but obliged my Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> to Garri&s;on it as he could, which he &s;hortly did; and that would have appear'd a very &s;mall Army to have march'd towards <HI>London;</HI> though it is true the Hor&s;e was a noble Body, and Superior in number to that of the Foot.</P>
<P>THERE was likewi&s;e another circum&s;tance, that few Men were then <MILESTONE N="5$"> acquainted with: Upon the fir&s;t News of the taking of <HI>Bristol,</HI> his Ma|je&s;ty, before he left <HI>Oxford,</HI> had &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the Earl of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> <Q>who was then engaged before <HI>Hull,</HI> &startq;that if he found the bu&s;ine&s;s

<P>THE King was newly &s;at down before <HI>Gloucester,</HI> when the Go|vernour <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Debates in the Council at</HI> Ox|ford <HI>$ow th$&s;e Lords &s;hould be receiv'd.</HI></NOTE> of <HI>Wallingford</HI> &s;ent notice to <HI>Oxford,</HI> of the Arrival of tho&s;e two Earls; <Q>to whom the Lords of the Council return'd direction, &startq;that&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> they &s;hould &s;tay there, till the King's plea&s;ure was under&s;tood;</Q> to whom the Secretary had &s;ent the information, and de&s;ired his Maje&s;ties will concerning their reception. The King well knew, any Order he &s;hould give in it, would be liable to many objections, and he had not &s;o good an inclination to either of them, as to run any inconvenience for their &s;akes; the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> having &s;erv'd in Per&s;on again&s;t him, as the General of the Rebels Hor&s;e; and the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> in the King's opinion, having done wor&s;e. <Q>And therefore his Maje&s;ty Com|manded, &startq;that his Privy Council &s;hould Debate the matter among them&s;elves, and pre&s;ent their opinion and advice to him, and he would&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> then determine what kind of Entertainment they &s;hould have.</Q> The opinions at the board were &s;everal; <Q>&s;ome thought, &startq;that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould receive them very graciou&s;ly, and with all outward expre&s;&s;ions of his acceptance of their return to his Service, and that the demeanour of all others to them &s;hould be &s;uch, as might make them think them|&s;elves very welcome, without the lea&s;t taking notice of any thing for|merly done ami&s;s by them; which would be a great encouragement to others to come away too: So that the Numbers, and Quality of tho&s;e who &s;taved behind, would probably in a &s;hort time be &s;o &s;mall, that they would have no reputation in the Kingdom to continue the&endq; <MILESTONE N="$0"> War.</Q> Many differ'd diametrically from this; and were &s;o far from thinking this advice agreeable to the dignity, or &s;ecurity of the King, <Q>that they thought it not fit &startq;to admit them pre&s;ently to the King's or

Queen's pre&s;ence, till by their good carriage and demeanour, they &s;hould give &s;ome te&s;timony of their Affections: They had both taken the late Covenant, of which one Clau&s;e was, to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Forces rai&s;ed by the Parliament, again&s;t the Army rai&s;ed by the King; with many reproaches, and known &s;candals upon that Army. If they had felt a true remor&s;e of Con&s;cience for the ill they had done, they would have left that Party, when that Covenant was to be impo&s;ed upon them; which, &s;ince they did not, that they came now was to be imputed ra|ther to the King's &s;ucce&s;s, and the weakne&s;s of that power which they had hitherto &s;erv'd, than to any reformation of their under&s;tanding, <MILESTONE N="10"> or improvement of their Allegiance: and that it was great rea&s;on, that they who had given &s;uch Arguments of ju&s;t jealou&s;y and &s;u&s;picion of them&s;elves, &s;hould rai&s;e a confidence in their Loyalty and Affection by &s;ome Act equal to the other; and therefore none who had taken that Covenant, &s;hould be admitted to the pre&s;ence of the King, Queen, or Prince, before he had taken &s;ome other Oath or Covenant, declaring an equal hatred, and abhorring of the Rebellious Armes which were taken up again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, and the Coun&s;els by which they were&endq; taken up.</Q></P>

<P>THIS di&s;cour&s;e and imagination had made wonderful impre&s;&s;ion upon the Queen, who was inflamed with a jealou&s;y that there was a de&s;ign to le&s;&s;en her Intere&s;t in the King, and that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was Chief in <MILESTONE N="20"> that Con&s;piracy, and meant to bring it to pa&s;s by keeping the King &s;till in the Army, and by hindring his coming to <HI>Oxford:</HI> and out of this apprehen&s;ion the Queen had written &s;o warmly and concernedly to the King, who was the mo&s;t incapable of any &s;uch apprehen&s;ions, and had her Maje&s;ty in &s;o perfect an adoration, that a&s;&s;oon as he receiv'd that Letter, without delay he came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and quickly compo&s;ed tho&s;e mi&s;takes; though the being engaged before <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> was &s;till very grievous, and reproaches were publickly ca&s;t upon tho&s;e who gave the advice.</P>

<P>IN this whole Debate, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who &s;el|dom &s;poke without &s;ome earne&s;tne&s;s, <Q>was the only Man (except an|other, who brought no credit to the opinion, the Lord <HI>Saville)</HI> who advi&s;ed confidently, &startq;that they might be very graciou&s;ly receiv'd by both their Maje&s;ties, and civilly be vi&s;ited, and treated by every Body; that other Men might, by the entertainment they receiv'd, be en|couraged&endq; to de&s;ert the Parliament too.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;it would be too great a di&s;advantage to the King, and to his Cau&s;e, that whil&s;t the Parliament u&s;ed all the indu&s;try and artifices, to corrupt the Duty and <MILESTONE N="20"> Affection of the Subject, and had their Armes open to receive and embrace all, who would come to them, his Maje&s;ty &s;hould admit none to return to him, who had been faulty, or not come &s;o &s;oon as they ought to have done; that if the King had a mind to gratify, and oblige the Parliament, he could not do it more to their hearts de&s;ire, than by rejecting the application of the&s;e Lords, or &s;uffering it to pa&s;s un|regarded.&endq;</Q> <Q>There was one Argument again&s;t their admi&s;&s;ion urged very lowdly, &startq;&endq; that it would di&s;turb the Peace of the place;</Q> the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> had Commanded that part of the Army, which in&s;e&s;ted the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> at his being at <HI>Sherborne,</HI> when the Marquis had <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;ent <HI>Harry Seymour,</HI> as is mention'd before, with a Challenge to the Earl to fight with him; which the Earl rea&s;onably declined at that time; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;he would be ready, when the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Parlia|ment &s;hould be over, to wait upon the Marquis when he &s;hould re|quire&endq; it.</Q> And &s;ome Men, who were near enough to the Marquis's Coun&s;els, undertook to know, that if the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> &s;hould be in <HI>Oxford,</HI> the Marquis, who was every day expected, would exact the performance of his promi&s;e; which &s;ure he was too wi&s;e to do.</P>
<P>THE King, during the whole Debate, did not expre&s;s any thing of his own &s;en&s;e, &s;ave that he &s;eem'd well plea&s;ed with any &s;harpne&s;s that <MILESTONE N="40"> was expre&s;s'd towards the Earl of <HI>Holland.</HI> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;that he was bound to his good behaviour, by being under the common reproach of in|clining too much to tho&s;e who had u&s;ed him wor&s;t; of which he would&endq; not be guilty:</Q> However, he did not think, at this time, that it would be good to make any Per&s;ons de&s;perate; <Q>and therefore gave order, &startq;that the Governour of <HI>Wallingford</HI> &s;hould permit them to continue their Journey to <HI>Oxford;</HI> where all Men might u&s;e what civilities they plea&s;ed to them; and that Him&s;elf, and the Queen, would do that towards them, which upon their application and addre&s;s, they &s;hould&endq; think fit:</Q> and though this determination was given, without the lea&s;t di&s;covery of grace towards the Per&s;ons of tho&s;e Lords, and not without &s;ome reflections of prejudice towards them, it was not grateful to the Ta|ble; which was evident enough by their Countenance. The next morning, the King return'd to the Army.</P>
<P><PB N="255" REF="2970">
THERE had been, as is &s;aid, very great divi&s;ions in the Coun&s;els at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> from the time of the Treaty, and the very abrupt break|ing it off; and the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> re&s;enting the Affront done to him by <HI>Martin,</HI> had encrea&s;ed tho&s;e divi&s;ions; and the ill &s;ucce&s;&s;es afterwards in the Defeat of <HI>Waller,</HI> and the taking of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> had given every Man Courage to &s;ay what he would. And then the proceeding upon M^r <HI>Waller</HI>'s di&s;covery, and obliging all Men to take a de&s;perate Engagement, which they dur&s;t not refu&s;e, for fear of being declared guilty of the Plot, as many of them were, incen&s;ed very many: But above all, the pro&s;perity of the King's Affairs made every Body wi&s;h to <MILESTONE N="10"> come into his Quarters. A great Number of the Hou&s;e of Commons, who were known allways to wi&s;h well, came to <HI>Oxford:</HI> and of the Peers, the Earl of <HI>Portland,</HI> who was allways very faithful to the King, and had &s;tayed in the Hou&s;e of Peers by his Maje&s;ties leave, and had been accu&s;ed by M^r <HI>Waller</HI> to be privy to that de&s;ign, upon which he had endured a long impri&s;onment, came at this time to <HI>Oxford,</HI> as is &s;aid before, together with the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Lovelace;</HI> the former of which had been likewi&s;e que&s;tion'd, and impri&s;on'd, and the latter had been as knowing of the matter, and of c$n&s;tant duty to the King; and all three had gotten liberty, and opportunity to come <MILESTONE N="20"> away by &s;wallowing that Vow, and Oath, which could only &s;et them free, and which they made ha&s;t to An&s;wer for to the King. The Return of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to <HI>London</HI> in ill humour, had given opportunity to the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> and the re&s;t, who were weary of the work in hand, to inflame him to re&s;entment of the neglects which had been put upon him, and the jealou&s;ies which were entertain'd of him. The Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> had given up his Commi&s;&s;ion of General of the Hor&s;e, and quitted the Service, and never had any Affection to their ways in his Judgement. The Earl of <HI>Clare</HI> had been with the King at <HI>York,</HI> and had his leave to return to <HI>London,</HI> to intend his own particular Affairs; <MILESTONE N="30"> and, during his &s;tay, had never concurred in any malicious Coun&s;el again&s;t the King, but was look'd upon as a Man, not only firm to the Principles of Monarchy, but of Duty to the Per&s;on of the King. He was a Man of Honour, and of Courage, and would have been an ex|cellent Per&s;on, if his heart had not been &s;et too much upon the keeping, and improving his E&s;tate; he was weary of the Company he kept, and ea&s;ily hearken'd to the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> in any con&s;ultation how to re|cover the King's Authority, and to put an end to the War. The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was, as is &s;aid before, enough provoked, and incen&s;ed, and willingly heard all the Lords, and others, who inveighed again&s;t the vio|lent <MILESTONE N="40"> Proceedings of tho&s;e who &s;wayed the Parliament, and differ'd not with them in his judgement of the Men, and the Matter: &s;o that they believ'd that he would as readily be di&s;po&s;ed to agree upon the Remedy, as he did upon the Di&s;ea&s;e.</P>
<P>THEIR end and de&s;ign was, as I &s;aid, if they could draw him to a concurrence, that They, and all the re&s;t of tho&s;e who were accounted moderate Men, that is who de&s;ired a Peace, and to return to their duty to the King (which were much the Major part of both Hou&s;es that re|main'd at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> after &s;o many of both were gone to the King) might all go to the Army; and thereupon the General, and They, to <MILESTONE N="$0"> write to the Parliament together, and to &s;end &s;uch Propo&s;itions to them, as the Parliament &s;hould tran&s;mit to the King, as the conditions of Peace. If the King &s;hould refu&s;e to con&s;ent to them, it would be an
<PB N="256" REF="2980">
infallible way to unite all People to compel him to it: but if the Parlia|ment would refu&s;e to tran&s;mit tho&s;e Propo&s;itions to the King, or to con|&s;ent to a Peace upon tho&s;e conditions, they would then declare again&s;t them, for not adhereing to the grounds upon which the War was fir&s;t begun, and would joyn them&s;elves to the King to force them to it. If this had been done in that conjuncture, when the authority and credit of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was not yet eclip&s;ed, and before an Independent Army was rai&s;ed, which was &s;hortly after done, it could not probably have failed of the &s;ucce&s;s de&s;ired. But the Earl was too &s;crupulous and too punctual to that which he called a Tru&s;t; and this was too barefaced <MILESTONE N="10"> a &s;eparation for him to engage in: Be&s;ides that he did believe, that he &s;hould be able to &s;uppre&s;s that violent Party by the Parliament it &s;elf, and he thought that would bring all about which he de&s;ired; and &s;o he did not only reject what was propo&s;ed to him, but expre&s;s'd &s;uch a di&s;|like of the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> for propo&s;ing it, that he thought it high time to get him&s;elf out of his reach. The Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> who allways con&s;ider'd Him&s;elf in the fir&s;t place, had, from the time of the Queen's landing, privately made offer of his Service to the Queen, and renew'd his old confidence and friend&s;hip with M^r <HI>Jermyn;</HI> and knowing well to enhance the value of his own Service, made great promi&s;es of nota|ble <MILESTONE N="20"> Service; <Q>and M^r <HI>Jermyn</HI> ea&s;ily per&s;waded her Maje&s;ty, &startq;that it was much better for her to re&s;tore an old Servant, whom &s;he knew &s;o well, to her confidence (though he had &s;tepped out of the way) than to rely upon the fidelity of any of tho&s;e, who were now about the King, and who were all upon the matter &s;trangers to her, at lea&s;t not enough&endq; known by her;</Q> <Q>and then, &startq;that by laying hold upon this opportunity, &s;he would, at her fir&s;t coming to the King, carry his Re&s;toration with her, po&s;&s;e&s;s her &s;elf of the whole frame of his bu&s;ine&s;s, becau&s;e all other de&s;igns would be laid a&s;ide; and &s;o all the good, that would re|dound to the King and Kingdom from this new Negotiation, mu&s;t, by <MILESTONE N="30"> the con&s;ent of all the world, be attributed to her Maje&s;ties Wi&s;dom&endq; and Conduct.</Q> This appearing hopeful to her Maje&s;ty, and all that had any thing of Hope was by the other allways looked upon as Certain, the corre&s;pondence was embraced; and the Earl a&s;&s;ured not only to be re|&s;tored to his former Station in all re&s;pects, but to a Title to new In|tere&s;ts. And upon this encouragement and obligation, when he found he could not prevail with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> that the King's Affairs pro&s;per'd, and that <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was now taken, and the Queen come to <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> he re&s;olv'd Him&s;elf to go thither, and prevailed with the Earls of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and <HI>Clare,</HI> to do the like; he a&s;&s;uring them, that they &s;hould be <MILESTONE N="40"> very well receiv'd. The Earl of <HI>Clare</HI> made his Journey by him&s;elf, out of the common Road, and came without any interruption into <HI>Oxford,</HI> at the time appointed: the Earls of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and <HI>Holland,</HI> came toge|ther to <HI>Wallingford,</HI> as is mention'd. The Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who was naturally &s;u&s;picious, went to his own Hou&s;e at <HI>Petworth</HI> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> by which he thought he &s;hew'd aver&s;ion enough to the Coun|&s;els at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and would keep it in his own power to return, if he found that the reception of the other Lords at <HI>Oxford</HI> was not an|&s;werable to their expectation; be&s;ides that he would expect the re&s;ult of the Lord <HI>Conway</HI>'s Negotiation, who was more tru&s;ted by him than <MILESTONE N="$$"> any other.</P>
<P>THE leave for the two Earls to come from <HI>Wallingford</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> was declared but the night before the King return'd to the Army; and
<PB N="257" REF="2990">
was not &s;ent thither till the next day. So that the Lords came not to <HI>Oxford</HI> till two days after, much mortified with the time they had been forced to &s;pend at <HI>Wallingford,</HI> and with the di&s;putation, they heard, had been held concerning them; of which they had receiv'd &s;o particu|lar information, that the Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> writ a very civil Letter to the Chancellor of the Exchequer before he came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> <Q>taking no|tice of &startq;&endq; the Affection he had &s;hew'd to him in his advice to the King.</Q> Both of them had Friends enough there to provide for their accommo|dation in convenient Lodgings, &s;o that the one had a Lodging at <HI>Mag|dalen</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> of which Hou&s;e he had formerly been a Mem|ber; <MILESTONE N="10"> the other lay in <HI>Baliol</HI> College, where he had a Daughter, who &s;pared him part of her Lodgings. But for any application to them by the Lords, or Per&s;ons in Authority there, they had no rea&s;on to think them|&s;elves very welcome. They went, in the fir&s;t place, to do their Duties to the Queen; who receiv'd them coldly enough, not out of di&s;inclina|tion, or unwillingne&s;s to &s;hew them any countenance, but pure com|$$ance with the ill humour of the Town, which &s;he dete&s;ted: nor did M^r <HI>Jermyn,</HI> who &s;till valued him&s;elf upon the impo&s;&s;ible faculty to plea&s;e All, and di&s;plea&s;e None, think fit to deal clearly with th$$ in that point (having, probably, &s;aid more in his Letters of corre&s;pondence and ad|vice, <MILESTONE N="20"> than he had Authority to do; it being his cu&s;tom to write, and &s;peak, what was mo&s;t grateful to the Per&s;ons) &s;o that the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> with whom alone the corre&s;pondence had been, began to think him&s;elf betrayed, and invited to <HI>Oxford</HI> only to be expo&s;ed to comtempt. He came one morning to vi&s;it the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when there were the Lord <HI>Cottington,</HI> and two or three other Privy Coun&s;ellors with him, who all went pre&s;ently away, without &s;o much as &s;aluting him; which offended the Chancellor as much as it did Him, and in truth obliged the Chancellor to more ceremony and civility, than, it may be, he would otherwi&s;e have practiced: &s;o that he did vi&s;it him again, and <MILESTONE N="$0"> made all profe&s;&s;ions and offers of kindne&s;s and &s;ervice to him; which he did very heartily; and complyed therein, not only with his own in|clinations, but with his judgement, as very important to the King's Ser|vice; and did all he could to induce others to be of the &s;ame opinion; in which he had no great &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P><Q>THE Intelligence from <HI>London</HI> brought, every day, the Re&s;olution of the Parliament, &startq;&endq;to relieve <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI></Q> and that, if their Levies did not &s;upply them with Men &s;oon enough, the Train'd-bands of the City would march out with the General for that Service: whereupon the three Earls, <HI>Bedford, Holland,</HI> and <HI>Clare,</HI> after &s;ome days &s;tay in <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> thought it nece&s;&s;ary to offer their Service to the King in the Ar|my, and to bear their part in any danger that might happen by an en|gagement between the Armies; and &s;o went together to <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> where the King receiv'd them without any di&s;re&s;pect, and &s;poke with them as they gave him occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>WHILST the King continued before <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> his Forces in the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Kings Af|fairs in the We&s;t.</NOTE> We&s;t moved with a full gale and tide of &s;ucce&s;s.

Upon the Surrender of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> many of the
<PB N="258" REF="3000">
Gentlemen, and others of that County, who were engaged in that City for the Parliament, had vi&s;ited their Hou&s;es, and Friends, in their Jour|ney to <HI>London,</HI> whither by their &s;afe conduct they went, and had made &s;uch prodigious di&s;cour&s;es of the fiercene&s;s and courage of the Cavaliers (as mo&s;t Men who run away, or are beaten, extol the power of the Enemy which had been too hard for them) that re&s;i&s;ting them begun to be thought a matter impo&s;&s;ible. One M^r <HI>Strode,</HI> a Man much relied on in tho&s;e parts and of a good Fortune, after he had vi&s;ited his Hou&s;e, took <HI>Dorchester</HI> in his way to <HI>London,</HI> <Q>and being de&s;ired by the Ma|gi&s;trates, &startq;to view their Works and Fortifications, and to give his Judge|ment&endq; <MILESTONE N="1$"> of them;</Q> <Q>after he had walked about them, he told them, &startq;that&endq; tho&s;e Works might keep out the Cavaliers about half an hour;</Q> and then told them &s;trange &s;tories of the manner of A&s;&s;aulting <HI>Bristol;</HI> <Q>&startq;and that the King's Soldiers made nothing of running up Walls twenty&endq; foot high, and that no Works could keep them out;</Q> which he &s;aid not out of any purpo&s;e to betray them (for no Man wi&s;h'd the King's Army wor&s;e &s;ucce&s;s) but had really &s;o much horror, and con&s;terna|tion about him, and the dreadful Image of the Storme of <HI>Bristol</HI> im|printed in his mind, that he did truly believe, they had &s;caled all tho&s;e Forts and Places which were deliver'd to them; and he propogated this fear and trepidation &s;o fruitfully where he came, that the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon</HI> came no &s;ooner near <HI>Dorchester</HI> with his Hor&s;e and Dra|goons (which, it may be, was under&s;tood to be the Van of the Victo|rious Army which had taken <HI>Bristol)</HI> but the Town &s;ent Commi&s;&s;ioners to him to Treat; and upon Articles of Indemnity, that they &s;hould not <NOTE PLACE="marg">Dorche&s;ter <HI>Surrender'd.</HI></NOTE> be plunder'd, and not &s;uffer for the ill they had done, deliver'd up the Town (which was &s;trongly Situated, and might very well have been Defended by the &s;pirits of the&s;e People, if they had Courage equal to their Malice; for a place more entirely di&s;affected to the King, <HI>England</HI> had not) with all their Armes, Ammunition, and Ordnance. The fame of the Earl's coming had before frighted S^r <HI>Walter Earl,</HI> who had for a long time Be&s;ieged <HI>Corfe-</HI>Ca&s;tle (the Hou&s;e of the Lord Chief Ju&s;tice <HI>Banks,</HI> defended by his Lady with her Servants, and &s;ome few Gentle|men, and Tenants, who betook them&s;elves thither for Her a&s;&s;i&s;tance, and their own &s;ecurity) from that Siege; and he making more ha&s;t to convey him&s;elf to <HI>London,</HI> than Generals u&s;e to do, who have the care and charge of others, his Forces were pre&s;ently di&s;per&s;ed. And now the Surrender of <HI>Dorchester</HI> (the Magazine from whence the other places were &s;upplied with principles of Rebellion) infu&s;ed the &s;ame &s;pirit into <HI>Weymouth,</HI> a very convenient Harbour and Haven: and that example <NOTE PLACE="marg">Weymouth, <HI>and</HI> Portland <HI>Surrender'd to the King's Forces.</HI></NOTE> again prevailed on the I&s;land and Ca&s;tle of <HI>Portland</HI> (a place not enough under&s;tood, but of wonderful importance) to all which the Earl granted fair conditions, and receiv'd them into his Maje&s;ties Protection.</P>
<P>HITHER Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> came now up with Foot and Cannon, and neglecting to follow the Train of the Enemies fears to <HI>Lyme,</HI> and <HI>Poole</HI> the only two Garri&s;ons then left in their po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion, &s;tayed with his Ar+my about <HI>Dorchester</HI> and <HI>Weymouth</HI> &s;ome days, under the Notion o$ &s;ettling and di&s;po&s;ing the Government of tho&s;e Garri&s;ons. Here the Soldiers, taking advantage of the famous Malignity of tho&s;e places, u&s;e$ great licence; neither was there care taken to ob&s;erve tho&s;e Article$ which had been made upon the Surrender of the Towns; which the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon,</HI> who was full of Honour and Ju&s;tice upon all Con+tracts, took &s;o ill, that he quitted the Command he had with tho&s;e Forces
<PB N="259" REF="3010">
and return'd to the King before <HI>Gloucester;</HI> which publi&s;h'd the inju&s;tice with the more &s;candal. Whether this Licence, which was much &s;poken of, and, no doubt, given out to be greater than it was, aliened the Af|fections of tho&s;e parts, or whether the ab&s;ence of the Marquis of <HI>Hert|ford</HI> from the Army, which was not till then taken notice of, begot an apprehen&s;ion that there would not be much Lenity u&s;ed towards tho&s;e who had been high, and pertinacious Offenders, or whether this Army, when it was together, &s;eem'd le&s;s formidable than it was before conceiv'd to be, or that the terror which had po&s;&s;e&s;s'd and &s;ei&s;ed upon their &s;pirits, was &s;o violent that it could not continue, and &s;o Men grew <MILESTONE N="10"> le&s;s amazed, I know not: but tho&s;e two &s;mall Towns, whereof <HI>Lyme</HI> was believ'd incon&s;iderable, return'd &s;o peremptory a refu&s;al to the Prince's Summons, that his Highne&s;s re&s;olv'd not to attack them; and &s;o march'd to <HI>Exeter,</HI> where he found all things in better order, and that <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Mau|rice <HI>comes be|fore</HI> Exeter <HI>with his Ar|my.</HI></NOTE> City more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, than he had rea&s;on to expect, by the diligence and dexterity of S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> who being &s;ent from <HI>Wells</HI> by the Mar|quis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> as is before remember'd, to govern the Affairs of <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> with one Regiment of Hor&s;e, and another of new levied and half-arm'd Foot, had &s;o encrea&s;ed his Numbers by t$e concurrence of the Gentlemen of that County, that he fixed &s;trong Quarters within <MILESTONE N="20"> le&s;s than a mile of the City, and kept his Guards even to the Gates; when the Earl of <HI>Stamford</HI> was within, with a &s;trength, at lea&s;t equal in number to the Be&s;iegers.</P>
<P>THE Parliament commended the relief of this place, by &s;pecial in|&s;tructions, to their Admiral the Earl of <HI>Warwick;</HI> after who&s;e having made &s;hew of Landing Men in &s;everal places upon the Coa&s;t, and there|by compelled S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> to make quick and weari&s;ome marches with Hor&s;e and Dragoons from place to place, the wind coming fair, the Fleet left tho&s;e who attended their Landing about <HI>Totne&s;s,</HI> turn'd about, and with a fre&s;h Gale made towards the River, that leads to the <MILESTONE N="30"> Walls of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and having the Command of both &s;ides of the River, upon a flat, by their Cannon, the Earl pre&s;umed that way he &s;hould be able to &s;end relief into the City; but the diligence, and providence of S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> had fortunately ca&s;t up &s;ome &s;light works upon the ad|vantageous nookes of the River, in which his Men might be in &s;ome &s;ecurity from the Cannon of the Ships; and made great ha&s;t with his Hor&s;e to hinder their Landing; and &s;o this attempt was not only with|out &s;ucce&s;s, but &s;o unfortunate, that it di&s;couraged the Seamen from endeavouring the like again. For after three or four hours pouring their great &s;hot, from their Ships, upon the Land Forces, the tide falling, <MILESTONE N="40"> the Earl of <HI>Warwick</HI> fell off with his Fleet, leaving three Ships behind <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Warwick <HI>with his Fleet attempts the relief of it, but &s;ucceeds not.</HI></NOTE> him, of which one was burnt, and the other two taken from the Land, in view of his whole Fleet; which no more looked after the Relief of <HI>Exeter</HI> that way.</P>
<P>WHILST all the King's Forces were employed in the blocking up the Town, and attending the Coa&s;t, to wait upon the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> the Garri&s;on of <HI>Plymouth</HI> encrea&s;ed very fa&s;t, into which the Fleet di&s;|burthen'd them&s;elves of all they could &s;pare; and the North parts of <HI>Devon-&s;hire</HI> gathered apace into a head for the Parliament; <HI>Barnstable,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> and <HI>Bediford,</HI> being Garri&s;on'd by them; which having an uninterrupted line of Communication with <HI>Plymouth,</HI> re&s;olv'd to joyn their whole &s;trength, and &s;o to compel the Enemy to draw off from the Walls of <HI>Exeter,</HI> which had been very ea&s;y to have been done, if they in the

City had been as active for their own pre&s;ervation. S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> having notice of this preparation and re&s;olution, &s;ent Colonel <HI>John Digby</HI> (who had from their fir&s;t entrance into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> Commanded the Hor&s;e) with his own Regiment of Hor&s;e, and &s;ome loo&s;e Troops of Dragoons, into the North of <HI>Devon,</HI> to hinder the joyning of the Rebels Forces. He cho&s;e <HI>Torrington</HI> for his Quarter, and within few days drew to him a Troop of new rai&s;ed Hor&s;e, and a Regiment of Foot, rai&s;ed by his old Friends in <HI>Cornwal;</HI> &s;o that he had with him above three hundred Hor&s;e, and &s;ix or &s;even hundred Foot. Tho&s;e of <HI>Bediford</HI> and <HI>Barnstable,</HI> being &s;uperior in number, and apprehending <MILESTONE N="10"> that the King's Succe&s;&s;es Ea&s;tward, might encrea&s;e His &s;trength and power There, and weaken Theirs, re&s;olv'd to try their Fortunes; and joyning them&s;elves together, to the Number of above twelve hundred Foot, and three hundred Hor&s;e, under the Command of Colonel <HI>Ben|net,</HI> hoped to &s;urpri&s;e Colonel <HI>John Digby</HI> at <HI>Torrington;</HI> and he was upon the matter &s;urpri&s;ed: <Q>for albeit he had notice in the night from <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> &startq;that the Forces drew out thence to <HI>Bediford</HI> in the night,&endq; and that they intended to fall on his Quarters early in the morning;</Q> and thereupon put him&s;elf into a po&s;ture to receive them, and drew up all his Forces together out of the Town, upon &s;uch a piece of ground, <MILESTONE N="20"> as, in that inclo&s;ed County, could be mo&s;t advantageous for his Hor&s;e, having, through all the little Inclo&s;ure, cut Gaps, through which his Hor&s;e might enter; yet, after he had attended their coming till Noon, and heard no more of them, and his &s;mall Parties, which were &s;ent out to enquire, return'd with a&s;&s;urance, that there was no appearance of an Enemy, he believ'd they had given over their de&s;ign; and &s;o di&s;|mi&s;&s;ed his Hor&s;e to their &s;everal Quarters, re&s;erving only one hundred and fifty upon their Guard, and return'd him&s;elf into the Town with the Foot.</P>
<P><Q>BUT, within le&s;s than an hour, he receiv'd the Alarm, &startq;that the&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> Enemy was within half a Mile of the Town.</Q> The confu&s;ion was very great, &s;o that he re&s;olv'd not to draw the Foot out of the Town; but having placed them in the be&s;t manner he could, upon the Avenues, him&s;elf went to the Hor&s;e out of the Town, re&s;olving to wait upon the Rear of the Enemy; who were drawn up on the &s;ame piece of ground, on which he had expected them all the morning. The Colonel, who&s;e courage, and vivacity upon Action, was very eminent, and commonly very fortunate, intended rather to look upon them, than to engage with them, before his others Troops came up; but having divided his &s;mall Party of Hor&s;e, the whole con&s;i&s;ting but of one hundred and fifty, <MILESTONE N="40"> into &s;everal Parties, and di&s;tributed them into &s;everal little Clo&s;es, out of which there were gaps into the larger ground, upon which the Ene|my &s;tood, a forelorne hope of fifty Mu&s;queteers advanced towards that ground where him&s;elf was, and if they had recover'd the Hedge, they would ea&s;ily have driven him thence. And therefore, as the only expe|dient left, him&s;elf taking four or five Officers into the Front with him, Charged that forelorne hope; which immediately threw down their Armes, and run upon their own Body, and carried &s;o infectious a fear <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> John Dig|by <HI>Routs the Parliaments&punc; Forces at</HI> Torrington.</NOTE> with them, that without making a Stand, or their Hor&s;e offering once to Charge, the whole Body Routed them&s;elves, and fled; Colonel <HI>Digby</HI> following the execution with his Hor&s;e, till their Swords were blunted with &s;laughter, and his Numbers over burthen'd with Pri&s;oners; though the Foot out of the Town ha&s;ten'd to the cha&s;e, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;aw what terror had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed their Enemies.</P>
<P><PB N="261" REF="3030">
IN this Action (for it cannot be called a Battle; hardly a Skirmi&s;h; where no re&s;i&s;tance was made) there were near two hundred killed, and above two hundred taken Pri&s;oners, and tho&s;e that fled contributed more to the Victory, than the Pri&s;oners, or the &s;lain, for they were &s;cat|ter'd and di&s;per&s;ed over all the Country, and &s;carce a Man without a cut over the face and head, or &s;ome other hurt; that wrought more upon the Neighbours towards their conver&s;ion, than any Sermon could be Preach'd to them. Some of the Principal Officers, and of their Hor&s;e, got into <HI>Bediford,</HI> and <HI>Barnstable;</HI> and not con&s;idering the inconve|nience of acknowledging, that God was extraordinary propitious to the <MILESTONE N="10"> Cavaliers, <Q>told &s;trange &s;tories of &startq;the horror and fear that &s;ei&s;ed upon them, and that no body &s;aw above &s;ix of the Enemy, that Charged&endq; them;</Q> which proved a greater di&s;may to their Friends, than their Defeat.</P>
<P>AT this time came Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> to <HI>Exeter,</HI> the fame of who&s;e arrival brought a new terror, &s;o that the Fort at <HI>Appledore,</HI> which com|manded the River to <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> and <HI>Bediford,</HI> being deliver'd to Colonel <HI>Digby,</HI> within two or three days after his Victory, tho&s;e two Towns &s;hortly after &s;ubmitted to his Maje&s;ty, upon promi&s;e of Pardon, and <NOTE PLACE="marg">Barn&s;table <HI>and</HI> Bediford <HI>yeilded to him.</HI></NOTE> &s;uch other Articles as were of cour&s;e; which Colonel <HI>Digby</HI> &s;aw pre|ci&s;ely <MILESTONE N="20"> ob&s;erv'd, as far as concern'd the Towns in point of plunder, or violence towards the Inhabitants. And this &s;ucce&s;s &s;o wrought upon the Spirits, and temper of that People, that all the Per&s;ons of eminent di&s;affection withdrawing them&s;elves, according to their liberty by the Articles; Colonel <HI>Digby,</HI> within very few days, encrea&s;ed his &s;mall Par|ty to the Number of three thou&s;and Foot, and eight hundred Hor&s;e; with which he was by Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> order'd to march to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> and to block up that place from making incur&s;ions into the Country.</P>
<P>THE lo&s;s of all their Garri&s;ons on the North Coa&s;t, and de&s;pair of &s;uccour or relief from any other place, prevailed with the Earl of <HI>Stam|ford,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> and that Committee in <HI>Exeter</HI> (to whom the Earl was not &s;u|perior) to Treat with the Prince; and thereupon Articles were agreed to; and that rich and plea&s;ant City was deliver'd on the fourth of <HI>Septem|ber,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Exeter <HI>deli|ver'd to the Prince upon Articles,</HI> Septemb. 4.</NOTE> which was within fourteen or &s;ixteen days after Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> came thither, into the King's protection, after it had &s;uffer'd no other di&s;tre&s;s, or impre&s;&s;ion from the Be&s;iegers, than the being kept from taking the Air without their own Walls, and from being &s;upplied from the Country Markets.</P>
<P>THERE was an accident fell out a little before this time, that gave <MILESTONE N="$0"> new Argument of trouble to the King, upon a difference between Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> and the Marquis. It hath been &s;aid, that the Earl of <HI>Carnar|von,</HI> who was General of the Hor&s;e of the We&s;tern Army, had march'd from <HI>Bristol</HI> the day before the Prince, and had taken <HI>Dorchester,</HI> and <HI>Weymouth,</HI> before his Highne&s;s came up to the Army, both con&s;iderable places, and the Seats of great Malignity. The former was not thought nece&s;&s;ary to be made a Garri&s;on, but the latter was the be&s;t Port Town of that Country, and to be kept with great care. The Marquis had made &s;ome promi&s;e of the Government thereof, when it &s;hould be taken (of which they made no doubt) to S^r <HI>Anthony A&s;hley Cooper,</HI> a young Gentleman of that Country, of a fair and plentiful Fortune, and one, who in the opinion of mo&s;t Men, was like to advance the place by be|ing Governour of it, and to rai&s;e Men for the defence of it, without le&s;&s;ening the Army; and had, in expectation of it, made &s;ome provi&s;ion
<PB N="262" REF="3040">
of Officers and Soldiers, when it &s;hould be time to call them together. Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> on the other &s;ide, had &s;ome other Per&s;on in his view, upon whom he intended to confer that charge, when it &s;hould fall. In the moment that the Town was taken, and before the Prince came thither, S^r <HI>Anthony,</HI> hearing that the Marquis came not with the Ar|my, but remain'd &s;ometime at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> made all the ha&s;t he could to him, and came thither the &s;ame day the King left it; and applied him|&s;elf to the Marquis, who remember'd his promi&s;e, and thought him&s;elf obliged to make it good, and that it was in his power &s;o to do, &s;ince it appear'd, that the Town was taken before the King had declared to <MILESTONE N="10"> him, that he &s;hould not go to the Army; till when he ought to be looked upon as General of it. He conferr'd with the Chancellor of the Exchequer upon it, as a matter in which his Honour was concern'd, and on which his heart was &s;et. <Q>S^r <HI>Anthony</HI> came likewi&s;e to him, who was of his acquaintance, and de&s;ired his a&s;&s;i&s;tance, &startq;that, after &s;o much charge he had been put to, in the expectation of it, and to prepare for it, he might not be expo&s;ed to the Mirth, and Contempt of the&endq; Country.</Q> It was evident that if he return'd with the Commi&s;&s;ion from the Marquis (which he was mo&s;t inclined to give him) both He and the Commi&s;&s;ion would be affronted, and the Town would not be &s;uf|fer'd <MILESTONE N="20"> to &s;ubmit to him. Therefore the Chancellor was of opinion, that there was no way but to appeal to the King, and de&s;ire his Favour, as well as his Ju&s;tice, in giving his Commi&s;&s;ion to the Per&s;on de&s;ign'd by the Marquis; which would remove that part of the exception, which would mo&s;t trouble the Prince; and he offer'd to write him&s;elf very earne&s;tly to the King. Be&s;ides his de&s;ire to gratify the Marquis, he did in truth believe it of great importance to his Maje&s;ties Service, to en|gage a Per&s;on of &s;uch a Fortune and Intere&s;t, &s;o throughly in his quar|rel, as he then believ'd &s;uch an obligation mu&s;t needs do; the flexibility and in&s;tability of that Gentleman's nature, not being then under&s;tood <MILESTONE N="30"> or &s;u&s;pected.</P>
<P>HE did write, with all the skill and importunity he could u&s;e, to the King; <Q>and writ to the Lord <HI>Falkland,</HI> &startq;to take S^r <HI>John Colepepper</HI> with him, if he found any aver&s;ion in the King, that they might to|gether&endq; di&s;cour&s;e, and prevail with him.</Q> But his Maje&s;ty po&s;itively and ob&s;tinately refu&s;ed to grant it; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;he would not, to plea&s;e the Marquis in an unju&s;t pretence, put a publick di&s;obligation and affront&endq; upon his Nephew.</Q> So the Expre&s;s return'd without effect, and the Marquis was as &s;en&s;ibly touched as could be imagin'd; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;that&endq; he was fallen from all credit with the King,</Q> and was made incapable of doing him farther Service; <Q>that his Fidelity &s;hould never be le&s;&s;en'd&startq;&endq; towards him (as in truth he was incapable of a di&s;loyal thought)</Q> <Q>&startq;but &s;ince he was become &s;o totally u&s;ele&s;s to the King, and to his Friends, he hoped his Maje&s;ty would give him leave to retire to his own Hou&s;e; where, he doubted not, he &s;hould be &s;uffer'd to live privately, and&endq; quietly, to pray for the King.</Q> The Chancellor knew well the nature of the Marquis, that would never give him leave to pur&s;ue any Re&s;o|lution which he found might prove inconvenient to his Maje&s;ty, for whom he had all po&s;&s;ible duty; yet he knew too, that the mi&s;chief was not &s;mall, from the ob&s;ervation that the Marquis thought him&s;elf ill u&s;ed, and that there were too many who would take the opportunity to foment tho&s;e jealou&s;ies and di&s;contents; and therefore re&s;olv'd (having di&s;patch'd all things which were incumbent on him at <HI>Bristol,</HI> and u&s;ed

all freedom with the Marquis, for the di&s;pelling all trouble&s;ome ima|ginations) to go him&s;elf to the King, and to repre&s;ent that affair to him, and the probable con&s;equences of it, with new In&s;tances. And at la&s;t, with very great difficulty, he did &s;o far prevail with his Maje&s;ty, that he gave a Commi&s;&s;ion to S^r <HI>Anthony A&s;hley Cooper,</HI> to be Governour of <HI>Weymouth;</HI> which he was the more ea&s;ily per&s;waded to, out of &s;ome prejudice he had to the Per&s;on, who, he under&s;tood, was de&s;ign'd to that Government. However, the Marquis receiv'd it as a &s;ea&s;onable Act of favour to him&s;elf, and in a &s;hort time after, came from <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to attend upon his Maje&s;ty according to his Command. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>AT <HI>Gloucester</HI> the bu&s;ine&s;s proceeded very &s;lowly: for though the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The pro&s;ecu|tion of the Siege of</HI> Glou|ce&s;ter.</NOTE> Army encrea&s;ed wonderfully there, by the acce&s;s of Forces from all Quarters, yet the King had neither Money, nor materials requi&s;ite for a Siege, and they in the Town behaved them&s;elves with great Courage and Re&s;olution, and made many &s;harp and bold Sallies upon the King's Forces, and Did more hurt commonly than they Receiv'd; and many Officers of Name, be&s;ides common Soldiers, were &s;lain in the Trenches, and Approaches; the Governour leaving nothing unperform'd that be|came a vigilant Commander. Sometimes, upon the Sa$$es, the Hor&s;e got between the Town and Them, &s;o that many Pri&s;oners were taken, <MILESTONE N="20"> who were allways drunk; <Q>and, after they were recover'd, they confe&s;s'd, &startq;that the Governour allways gave the Party that made the Sally, as&endq; much Wine and &s;trong Water as they de&s;ired to drink:</Q> &s;o that it &s;eems their mettle was not purely natural; yet it is very ob&s;ervable, that, in all the time the King lay there with a very glorious Army, and after the taking of a City of much greater name, there was no one Officer run from the Town to him, nor above three common Soldiers, which is a great Argument, the di&s;cipline within was very good. Be&s;ides the lo&s;s of Men before the Town, both from the Walls, and by &s;ickne&s;s (which was not greater than was to be rea&s;onably expected) a very great <MILESTONE N="$0"> Licence broke into the Army both among Officers, and Soldiers; the malignity of tho&s;e parts being thought excu&s;e for the exerci&s;e of any rapine, or &s;everity among the Inhabitants. In&s;omuch as it is hardly to be credited, how many thou&s;and Sheep were in a few days de&s;troyed, be&s;ides what were brought in by the Commi&s;&s;aries for a regular provi|&s;ion; and many Country Men impri&s;on'd by Officers without Warrant, or the lea&s;t knowledge of the King's, till they had paid good Sums of Money, for their Delinquency; all which brought great clamour upon the Di&s;cipline of the Army, and Ju&s;tice of the Officers, and made them likewi&s;e le&s;s prepared for the Service they were to expect.</P>
<P>IN the mean time nothing was left at <HI>London</HI> unattempted, that might advance the preparation for the relief of <HI>Gloucester.</HI> All Over|tures of Peace were &s;uppre&s;s'd, and the City purely at the Devotion of tho&s;e who were mo&s;t Violent, who put one complement upon them at this time, that is not to be pa&s;&s;ed over. It is remember'd before, that, $at the beginning of the&s;e di&s;tractions, before the King's going into the North, his Maje&s;ty had, upon the reiterated importunity of the two Hou&s;es, made S^r <HI>John Coniers</HI> Lieutenant of the Tower of <HI>London;</HI> who was a Soldier of very good e&s;timation, and had been the Lieutenant General of his Hor&s;e in that la&s;t preparation again&s;t the <HI>Scots,</HI> and Go|vernour of <HI>Berwick.</HI> The Parliament thought, by this obligation, to have made him their own Creature, and de&s;ired to have engaged him in &s;ome active Command in their Armies, having the Reputation of
<PB N="264" REF="3070">
one of the be&s;t Officers of Hor&s;e of that time. But he warily declined that engagement, and conteined him&s;elf within the limits of that place, which, by the multitude of Pri&s;oners, &s;ent to the Tower by the two Hou&s;es, and the exce&s;&s;ive Fees they paid, yeilded him a va&s;t profit; in the admini&s;tration whereof, he was &s;o impartial, that tho&s;e Pri&s;oners who &s;uffer'd mo&s;t for his Maje&s;ty, found no more favour or indulgence from him, than the re&s;t. About this time, either di&s;cerning that they grew to Confide le&s;s in him, than they had done, and that he mu&s;t en|gage him&s;elf in their Service, or &s;hould &s;hortly lo&s;e the benefit of their good opinion, or really abhorring to be &s;o near tho&s;e Actions he &s;aw <MILESTONE N="10"> every day committed, and to lie under the &s;candal of keeping his Ma|je&s;ties only Fort which he could not apply to his Service, <Q>he de&s;ired leave from the Hou&s;es &startq;&endq; to go into <HI>Holland,</HI></Q> where his Education had been, and his Fortune was, without obliging him&s;elf to a time of re|turn. The Propo&s;ition was not unwelcome to the Hou&s;es; and there|upon they immediately committed that charge, the Cu&s;tody of the Tower of <HI>London,</HI> to the Lord May or <HI>Pennington;</HI> that the City might <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Cu&s;tody of the Tower committed by the two Hou&s;es to the Lord Mayor</HI> Pen|nington.</NOTE> &s;ee they were tru&s;ted to hold their own Reines, and had a juri&s;diction committed to them which had allways ju&s;tled with their own. This complement &s;erv'd to a double purpo&s;e; for thereby, as they made the <MILESTONE N="20"> City believe they had put them&s;elves under their protection, &s;o they were &s;ure, they had put the City under the power, or under the appre|hen&s;ion of the power of him, who would never for&s;ake them out of an Appetite to Peace.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> now declared, that he would him&s;elf undertake the relief of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> whereas before S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> was de&s;ign'd to it, and, whence&s;oever it proceeded, was return'd to his old full ala|crity again&s;t the King, and recover'd tho&s;e Officers and Soldiers again to him, who had ab&s;ented by his Connivance, or upon an opinion that he would march no more; yet his Numbers encrea&s;ed not &s;o fa&s;t as the occa&s;ion required: for Colonel <HI>Ma&s;&s;y</HI> found means to &s;end many Me&s;|&s;engers out of the Town, to adverti&s;e the &s;treights he was in, and the time that he &s;hould be able to hold out. Their Ordinance of Pre&s;&s;ing, though executed with unu&s;ual rigour, in&s;omuch as Per&s;ons of good For|tunes, who had retired to <HI>London,</HI> that they might be le&s;s taken notice of, were &s;ei&s;ed on, and detain'd in Cu&s;tody, till they paid &s;o much Mo|ney, or procured an able Man to go in their places, brought not in &s;uch a &s;upply as they expected; and &s;uch as were brought in, and de|liver'd to the Officers, declared &s;uch an aver&s;ne&s;s to the work to which they were de&s;ign'd, and &s;uch a Peremptory re&s;olution not to Fight, that they only encrea&s;ed their Numbers, not their Strength, and run away upon the fir&s;t opportunity. In the end, they had no other re&s;ort for Men, but to tho&s;e who had &s;o con&s;tantly &s;upplied them with Money and prevailed with their true Friends, the City, which they &s;till alarm'$ with the King's irreconcilablene&s;s to them, to &s;end three or four of thei$ Train'd-band Regiments, or Auxiliaries, to Fight with the Enemy a$ that di&s;tance, rather than to expect him at their own Walls, where the$ mu&s;t be a&s;&s;ured to &s;ee him a&s;&s;oon as <HI>Gloucester</HI> &s;hould be reduced; an$ then they would be as much perplexed with the Malignants within, a$ with the Enemy without their City.</P>

It would not at fir&s;t be credited at the Leaguer, that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> could be in a condition to attempt &s;uch a work; and therefore they were too negligent upon the Intelligence, and &s;u&s;pected rather that he would give &s;ome Alarm to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where the Queen was, and thereby hope to draw the Army from <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> than that in truth he would venture upon &s;o tedious a march, where he mu&s;t pa&s;s over a Campagne <MILESTONE N="10"> near thirty miles in length, where half the King's Body of Hor&s;e would di&s;tre&s;s, if not de&s;troy his whole Army, and through a Country eaten bare, where he could find neither Provi&s;ion for Man nor Hor&s;e; and if he &s;hould, without interruption, be &s;uffer'd to go into <HI>Gloucester,</HI> he could neither &s;tay there, nor po&s;&s;ibly retire to <HI>London,</HI> without being de&s;troyed in the Rear by the King's Army, which &s;hould neverthele&s;s not engage it &s;elf in the hazard of a Battle. Upon the&s;e conclu&s;ions they proceeded in their works before <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> their Galleries being near fini&s;h'd, and vi&s;ibly a great want of Ammunition in $he Town; yet the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI> was appointed, with a good Party of $or&s;e, to wait <MILESTONE N="20"> about <HI>Banbury,</HI> and to retire before the Enemy, if he &s;hould advance towards <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and to give &s;uch impediments to their march, as in &s;uch a Country might be ea&s;y to do; Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> him&s;elf &s;taying with the Body of Hor&s;e, upon the Hills above <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> to joyn, if the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;hould be &s;o hardy as to venture.</P>
<P>THE Earl came to <HI>Brackly,</HI> and having there taken in from <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> and <HI>Bedford,</HI> the la&s;t recruits upon which he depended, he march'd &s;teadily over all that Campagne, which they thought he fear'd, towards <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> and though the King's Hor&s;e were often within view, and entertain'd him with light Skirmi&s;hes, he pur&s;ued his direct way; the <MILESTONE N="$0"> King's Hor&s;e &s;till retiring before him, till the Foot was compelled to rai&s;e the Siege, in more di&s;order and di&s;traction, than might have been <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Siege of</HI> Glouce&s;ter <HI>rai&s;ed.</HI></NOTE> expected; and &s;o with le&s;s lo&s;s, and ea&s;ier Skirmi&s;hes, than can be ima|gined, the Earl, with his Army and Train, march'd to <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> where he found them reduced to one &s;ingle Barrel of Powder; and all other Provi&s;ions an&s;werable. And it mu&s;t be confe&s;s'd, that Governour gave a &s;top to the Career of the King's good &s;ucce&s;s, and from his pertinacious defence of that place, the Parliament had time to recover their broken Forces, and more broken Spirits; and may acknowledge to this ri&s;e, the greatne&s;s to which they afterwards a&s;pired.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;tayed in that joyful Town (where he was receiv'd with all po&s;&s;ible demon&s;trations of honour) three days; and in that time, which was as wonderful as any part of the Story, cau&s;ed all nece&s;&s;ary Provi&s;ions to be brought in to them, out of tho&s;e very Quarters in which the King's Army had been &s;u&s;tain'd, and which they conceiv'd to be entirely &s;pent: So &s;ollicitous were the People to conceal what they had, and to re&s;erve it for Them; which, without a Connivance from the King's Commi&s;&s;aries, could not have been done. All this time, the King lay at <HI>Sudley-</HI>Ca&s;tle, the Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Chandois,</HI> within eight miles of <HI>Gloucester,</HI> watching when that Army would return; which, they conceiv'd, &s;tayed rather out of de&s;pair than election, in tho&s;e eaten Quarters; and, to open them a way for their retreat, his Maje&s;ty re|moved to <HI>E&s;ham,</HI> hoping the Earl would choo&s;e to go back the &s;ame
<PB N="266" REF="3090">
way he came; which, for many rea&s;ons, was to be de&s;ired; and there|upon the Earl march'd to <HI>Tewkesbury,</HI> as if he had no other purpo&s;e. The King's Hor&s;e, though bold, and vigorous upon Action, and Execu|tion, were allways le&s;s patient of duty, and ill accommodation than they &s;hould be; and at this time, partly with wearine&s;s, and partly with the indi&s;po&s;ition that po&s;&s;e&s;s'd the whole Army upon this relief of the Town, were le&s;s vigilant towards the motion of the Enemy: So that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was march'd with his whole Army and Train from <HI>Tewkesbury,</HI> four and twenty hours before the King heard which way he was gone: for he took the advantage of a dark night, and having <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;ure Guides, reach'd <HI>Cirence&s;ter,</HI> before the breaking of the day; where <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>in his return &s;ei&s;es upon</HI> Ciren|ce&s;ter.</NOTE> he found two Regiments of the King's Hor&s;e quartered &s;ecurely; all which, by the negligence of the Officers (a common and fatal crime throughout the War, on the King's part) he &s;urpri&s;ed, to the number of above three hundred; and which was of much greater value, he found there a great quantity of Provi&s;ions, prepared, by the King's Commi&s;&s;aries, for the Army before <HI>Gloucester,</HI> and which they neglected to remove after the Siege was rai&s;ed, and &s;o mo&s;t &s;otti&s;hly left it for the relief of the Enemy, far more apprehen&s;ive of hunger than of the Sword; and indeed this wonderful &s;upply &s;trangely exalted their Spirits <MILESTONE N="20"> as &s;ent by the &s;pecial care and extraordinary hand of providence, even when they were ready to faint.</P>
<P>FROM hence the Earl, having no farther apprehen&s;ion of the King's Hor&s;e, which he had no mind to encounter upon the open Campagne, and being at the lea&s;t twenty miles before him, by ea&s;y marches, that his &s;ick and wearied Soldiers might overtake him, moved, through that deep and enclo&s;ed County of North <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> his direct way to <HI>Lon|don.</HI> A&s;&s;oon as the King had &s;ure notice which way the Enemy was gone, he endeavour'd, by expedition and diligence, to recover the ad|vantage, which the &s;upine negligence of tho&s;e he tru&s;ted, had robbed <MILESTONE N="30"> him of; and Him&s;elf, with matchle&s;s indu&s;try, taking care to lead up the Foot, Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> with near five thou&s;and Hor&s;e, march'd day and night over the Hills, to get between <HI>London</HI> and the Enemy before they &s;hould be able to get out of tho&s;e enclo&s;ed deep Countrys, in which they were engaged between narrow Lanes, and to entertain them with Skirmi&s;hes till the whole Army &s;hould come up. This de&s;ign, pur&s;ued and executed with indefatigable pains, &s;ucceeded to his wi&s;h; for when the Van of the Enemies Army had allmo&s;t march'd over <HI>Awborne</HI> Cha&s;e, intending that night to have reach'd <HI>Newbury,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> beyond their fear, or expectation, appear'd with a &s;trong Body of Hor&s;e &s;o near them, that before they could put them&s;elves in order to receive him, he charged their Rear, and routed them with good execution; and though the Enemy perform'd the Parts of good Men, and applied them|&s;elves more dexterou&s;ly to the relief of each other, than on &s;o &s;uddain and unlook'd for an occa&s;ion was expected, yet with &s;ome difficulty, and the lo&s;s of many Men, they were glad to &s;horten their Journey, and the night coming on, took up their Quarters at <HI>Hungerford.</HI></P>
<P>IN this conflict, which was very &s;harp for an hour or two, many fell of the Enemy, and of the King's Party none of Name, but the Marquis of <HI>Vieu Ville,</HI> a Gallant Gentleman of the <HI>French</HI> Nation, who had at|tended the Queen out of <HI>Holland,</HI> and put him&s;elf as a Voluntier upon this Action, into the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI>'s Regiment. There were hurt ma|ny Officers, and among tho&s;e the Lord <HI>Jermyn</HI> receiv'd a &s;hot in his

Arm with a Pi&s;tol, owing the pre&s;ervation of his Life from other &s;hots to the excellent temper of his Armour; and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> a &s;trange hurt in the face, a Pi&s;tol being di&s;charged at &s;o near a di&s;tance upon him, that the Powder fetch'd much blood from his face, and for the pre&s;ent blinded him, without farther mi&s;chief; by which it was concluded, that the Bullet had dropped out before the Pi&s;tol was di&s;charged: And may be reckon'd among one of tho&s;e e&s;capes, of which that Gallant Per|&s;on hath pa&s;&s;ed a greater number, in the cour&s;e of his Life, than any Man I know.</P>
<P>BY this expedition of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> the Enemy was forced to &s;uch <MILESTONE N="10"> delay, that the King came up with his Foot and Train, though his num|bers, by his exceeding long and quick marches, and the Licence which many Officers and Soldiers took whil&s;t the King lay at <HI>E&s;ham,</HI> were much le&s;&s;en'd, being above two thou&s;and fewer, than when he rai&s;ed his Siege from <HI>Glouce&s;ter.</HI> And when the Earl, the next day, advanced from <HI>Hungerford,</HI> hoping to recover <HI>Newbury,</HI> which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> with his Hor&s;e would not be able to hinder him from; when he came within two miles of the Town, he found the King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it. For his Maje&s;ty, with his whole Army, was come thither two hours before; this put him to a nece&s;&s;ity of &s;taying upon the Field that night; it be|ing <MILESTONE N="20"> now the &s;eventeenth day of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>IT was now thought by many, that the King had recover'd what&s;o|ever had been lo&s;t by former Over&s;ights, Omi&s;&s;ions, or Neglects, and that by the de&s;troying the Army which had reliev'd <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> he &s;hould be fully recompenced for being di&s;appointed of that purcha&s;e. He &s;eem'd to be po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of all advantages to be de&s;ired, a good Town to refre&s;h his Men in, whil&s;t the Enemy lodged in the Field, his own Quarters to friend, and his Garri&s;on of <HI>Wallingford</HI> at hand, and <HI>Oxford</HI> it &s;elf within di&s;tance for &s;upply of what&s;oever &s;hould be wanting; when the Enemy was equally tired with long marches, and from the time that <MILESTONE N="$0"> the Prince had attacked them, the day before, had &s;tood in their Armes in a Country where they could not find Victual. So that it was con|ceiv'd, that it was in the King's power, whether he would fight or no, and therefore that he might compel them to notable di&s;advantages, who mu&s;t make their way through, or &s;tarve; and this was &s;o fully under|&s;tood, that it was re&s;olv'd over night, not to engage in Battle, but upon &s;uch grounds as &s;hould give an A&s;&s;urance of Victory. But, contrary to this re&s;olution, when the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had, with excellent conduct, drawn out his Army in Battalia, upon a Hill called <HI>Bigg</HI>'s-Hill, within le&s;s than a mile of the Town, and order'd his Men in all places to the <MILESTONE N="$0"> be&s;t advantage, by the precipitate Courage of &s;ome young Officers, who had good Commands, and who unhappily allways undervalued the Cou|rage of the Enemy, &s;trong Parties became &s;ucce&s;&s;ively &s;o far engaged, that the King was compelled to put the whole to the hazard of a Bat|tle, and to give the Enemy at lea&s;t an equal game to play.</P>
<P>IT was di&s;puted, on all parts, with great Fiercene&s;s and Courage; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battle of</HI> Newbury.</NOTE> the Enemy pre&s;erving good Order, and &s;tanding rather to keep the ground they were upon, than to get more; by which they did not ex|po&s;e them&s;elves to tho&s;e di&s;advantages, which any motion would have offer'd to the A&s;&s;ailants. The King's Hor&s;e, with a kind of contempt of the Enemy, Charged with wonderful boldne&s;s, upon all grounds of in|equality; and were &s;o far too hard for the Troops of the other &s;ide, that they Routed them in mo&s;t places, till they had left the greate&s;t part
<PB N="268" REF="3120">
of their Foot without any guard at all of Hor&s;e. But then the Foot be|haved them&s;elves admirably on the Enemies part, and gave their &s;cat|ter'd Hor&s;e time to Rally, and were ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t and &s;ecure them upon all occa&s;ions. The <HI>London</HI> Train'd-bands, and Auxiliary Regiments (of who&s;e inexperience of danger, or any kind of Service, beyond the ea&s;y practice of their Po&s;tures in the Artillery Garden, Men had till then too cheap an e&s;timation) behaved them&s;elves to wonder; and were, in truth, the pre&s;ervation of that Army that day. For they &s;tood as a Bulwark and Rampire to defend the re&s;t; and when their wings of Hor&s;e were &s;catter'd, and di&s;per&s;ed, kept their ground &s;o &s;teadily, that, though Prince <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>Rupert</HI> him&s;elf led up the choice Hor&s;e to Charge them, and endured their &s;torm of &s;mall &s;hot, he could make no impre&s;&s;ion upon their &s;tand of Pikes, but was forced to wheel about: of &s;o Soveraign benefit and u&s;e, is that readine&s;s, order, and dexterity in the u&s;e of their Armes, which hath been &s;o much neglected.</P>
<P>IT was fought all that day without any &s;uch notable turn, as that either Party could think they had much the better. For though the King's Hor&s;e made the Enemies often give ground, yet the Foot were &s;o immoveable, that little was gotten by the other; and the fir&s;t entrance into the Battle was &s;o &s;uddain, and without Order, that, during the whole day, no u&s;e was made of the King's Cannon, though that of the Enemy was placed &s;o unhappily, that it did very great execution upon the King's Party, both Hor&s;e and Foot. The night parted them, when nothing el&s;e could; and each Party had then time to revolve the over|&s;ights of the day. The Enemy had fared at lea&s;t as well as they hoped for; and therefore, in the morning early, they put them&s;elves in order of marching, having an obligation in nece&s;&s;ity to gain &s;ome place, in which they might eat and &s;leep. On the King's &s;ide there was not that caution which &s;hould have been the day before, and though the Num|ber of the &s;lain was not &s;o great, as, in &s;o hot a day, might have been looked for; yet very many Officers and Gentlemen were hurt: &s;o that they rather cho&s;e to take advantage of the Enemies motion, than to Charge them again upon the old ground, from whence they had been, by order, called off the night before, when they had recover'd a Po&s;t, the keeping of which would much have prejudiced the Adver&s;ary. The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> finding his way open, pur&s;ued his main de&s;ign of return+ing to <HI>London,</HI> and took that way by <HI>Newbury,</HI> which led towards <HI>Reading;</HI> which Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> ob&s;erving, &s;uffer'd him, without inter+ruption or di&s;trubance, to pa&s;s, till his whole Army was enter'd into the narrow Lanes; and then with a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e, and one thou&s;and Mu&s;queteers, followed his Rear with &s;o good effect, that h$ put them into great di&s;order, and killed many, and took many Pri&s;oners However the Earl, with the gro&s;s of his Army, and all his Cannon, go &s;afe into <HI>Reading;</HI> and, after a night or two &s;pent there to refre&s;h an$ <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>gets in|to</HI> Reading; <HI>thence, to</HI> London.</NOTE> re&s;t his Men, he moved in a &s;low and orderly march to <HI>London,</HI> leavin$ <HI>Reading</HI> to the King's Forces; which was pre&s;ently po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by S^r <HI>Jaco$ A&s;hley,</HI> with three thou&s;and Foot and five hundred Hor&s;e, and mad$ again a Garri&s;on for the King: his Maje&s;ty and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> with th$ remainder of the Army, retiring to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and leaving a Garri&s;on u$+der the Command of Colonel <HI>Boys</HI> in <HI>Dunnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle (a Hou&s;e $$ <HI>John Packers,</HI> but more famous for having been the Seat of <HI>Geoffe$ Chaucer,</HI> within a mile of <HI>Newbury)</HI> to Command the great Roa$ through which the We&s;tern Trade was driven to <HI>London.</HI></P>

AT this time S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> was at <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> with above two thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and as many Foot; as unconcern'd for what might be|fall the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> as the Earl had formerly been on His behalf at <HI>Roundway-</HI>Hill: otherwi&s;e, if he had advanced upon the King to <HI>New|bury</HI> (which was not above twenty miles) when the Earl was on the other &s;ide, the King had been in great danger of an utter Defeat; and the apprehen&s;ion of this, was the rea&s;on, or was afterwards pretended to be, for the ha&s;ty engagement in Battle.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was receiv'd at <HI>London,</HI> with all imaginable de|mon&s;trations of Affection, and Reverence; Publick, and Solemn Thank&s;|giving <MILESTONE N="10"> was appointed for his Victory; for &s;uch they made no &s;cruple to declare it. Without doubt, the Action was perform'd by him with in|comparable Conduct and Courage; in every part whereof, very much was to be imputed to his own Per&s;onal Virtue; and it may be well reckon'd among the mo&s;t Soldierly Actions of this unhappy War. For he did the bu&s;ine&s;s he undertook, and, after the Relief of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> his next care was to retire with his Army to <HI>London;</HI> which, con&s;idering the length of the way, and the difficulties he was to contend with, he did with le&s;s lo&s;s than could be expected; on the other hand, the King was not without &s;igns of a Victory. He had followed, and compelled <MILESTONE N="20"> the Enemy to Fight, by overtaking him, when he de&s;ired to avoid it. He had the &s;poil of the Field, and pur&s;ued the Enemy the next day af|ter the Battle, and had a good execution upon them, without receiving any lo&s;s; and, which &s;eem'd to Crown the Work, fixed a Garri&s;on again at <HI>Reading,</HI> and thereby &s;treighten'd their Quarters as much as they were in the beginning of the year; his own being enlarged by the all|mo&s;t entire Conque&s;t of the We&s;t, and his Army much &s;tronger, in Hor&s;e and Foot, than when he fir&s;t took the Field. On which &s;ide &s;oever the Marks and publick En&s;igns of Victory appear'd mo&s;t con&s;picuous, cer|tain it is, that according to the unequal fate, that attended all Skirmi&s;hes <MILESTONE N="30"> and Conflicts with &s;uch an Adver&s;ary, the lo&s;s on the King's &s;ide was in Weight much more con&s;iderable, and penetrating; for whil&s;t &s;ome ob|&s;cure, unheard of Colonel or Officer, was mi&s;&s;ing on the Enemies &s;ide, and &s;ome Citizen's Wife bewailed the lo&s;s of her Husband, there were on the other, above twenty Officers of the Field, and Per&s;ons of Ho|nour, and publick Name, &s;lain upon the place, and more of the &s;ame Quality hurt.</P>
<P>HERE fell the Earl of <HI>Sunderland,</HI> a Lord of great Fortune, tender <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Sunderland <HI>&s;lain in this Battle:</HI></NOTE> years (being not above three and twenty years of Age) and an early Judgement; who, having no Command in the Army, attended upon the <MILESTONE N="$0"> King's Per&s;on, under the obligation of Honour; and putting him&s;elf that day in the King's Troop a Voluntier, before they came to Charge, was taken away by a Cannon Bullet.</P>
<P>THIS day al&s;o fell the Earl of <HI>Carnarvon,</HI> who, after he had Charged, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>And the Earl of</HI> Carnarvon; <HI>his Character.</HI></NOTE> and Routed a Body of the Enemies Hor&s;e, coming carele&s;sly back by &s;ome of the &s;catter'd Troopers, was, by one of them who knew him, run through the Body with a Sword; of which he died within an hour.

After the Trou|bles begun, having the Command of the fir&s;t or &s;econd Regiment of Hor&s;e, that was rai&s;ed for the King's Service, he wholely gave him&s;elf up to the office and duty of a Soldier; no Man more diligently Obeying, or more dexterou&s;ly Commanding; for he was not only of a very keen Courage in the expo&s;ing his Per&s;on, but an excellent Di&s;cerner and Pur|&s;uer of Advantage upon his Enemy.

Tho&s;e Infirmities, and that Licence, which he had formerly <MILESTONE N="10"> indulged to him&s;elf, he put off with &s;everity, when others thought them excu&s;able under the notion of a Soldier.

liberal and bountiful Patron towards them, even above his Fortune; of which, in tho&s;e admini&s;trations, he was &s;uch a Di&s;pen&s;er, as, if he had been tru&s;ted with it to &s;uch U&s;es, and if there had been the lea&s;t of Vice in his expence, he might have been thought too prodigal. He was con&s;tant and pertinacious in what&s;oever he re&s;olv'd to do, and not to be wearied by any pains that were nece&s;&s;ary to that end. And therefore having once re&s;olv'd not to &s;ee <HI>London,</HI> which he loved above all places, till he had perfectly learned the Greek Tongue, he went to his own Hou&s;e in the Country, and pur&s;ued it with that indefatigable Indu&s;try, that it will not be believ'd in how &s;hort a time he was Ma&s;ter of it, and <MILESTONE N="10"> accurately read all the Greek Hi&s;torians.</P>
</LETTER>
<P>IN this time, his Hou&s;e being within little more than ten miles of <HI>Oxford,</HI> he contracted familiarity and friend&s;hip with the mo&s;t polite and accurate Men of that Univer&s;ity; who found &s;uch an immen&s;ne&s;s of Wit, and &s;uch a &s;olidity of Judgement in him, &s;o infinite a Fancy, bound in by a mo&s;t Logical ratiocination, &s;uch a va&s;t knowledge, that he was not ignorant in any thing, yet &s;uch an exce&s;&s;ive humility, as if he had known nothing, that they frequently re&s;orted, and dwelt with him, as in a College &s;ituated in a purer Air; &s;o that his Hou&s;e was a Univer&s;ity in a le&s;s Volume; whither they came not &s;o $uch for Re|po&s;e <MILESTONE N="20"> as Study; and to examine and refine tho&s;e gro&s;&s;er Propo&s;itions, which lazine&s;s and con&s;ent made current in vulgar Conver&s;ation.</P>
<P>MANY attempts were made upon him by the in&s;tigation of his Mo|ther (who was a Lady of another per&s;wa&s;ion in Religion, and of a mo&s;t Ma&s;culine under&s;tanding, allayed with the pa&s;&s;ion and infirmities of her own Sex) to pervert him in his Piety to the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and to reconcile him to that of <HI>Rome;</HI> which they pro&s;ecuted with the more confidence, becau&s;e he declined no opportunity or occa&s;ion of conference with tho&s;e of that Religion, whether Prie&s;ts, or Laicks; having dili|gently &s;tudied the controver&s;ies, and exactly read all, or the choice&s;t of <MILESTONE N="$0"> the Greek, and Latin Fathers, and having a Memory &s;o &s;tupendious, that he remember'd, on all occa&s;ions, what&s;oever he read. And he was &s;o great an Enemy to that pa&s;&s;ion and uncharitablene&s;s, which he &s;aw produced, by difference of opinion, in matters of Religion, that in all tho&s;e di&s;putations with Prie&s;ts, and others of the Roman Church, he affected to manife&s;t all po&s;&s;ible Civility to their Per&s;ons, and e&s;timation of their Parts; which made them retain &s;till &s;ome hope of his reduction, even when they had given over offering farther rea&s;ons to him to that purpo&s;e. But this charity towards them was much le&s;&s;en'd, and any corre&s;pondence with them quite declined, when, by &s;ini&s;ter Arts, they had corrupted his two younger Brothers, being both Children, and &s;tolen them from his Hou&s;e, and tran&s;ported them beyond Seas, and perverted his Si&s;ters: upon which occa&s;ion he writ two large di&s;cour&s;es again&s;t the principal po&s;itions of that Religion, with that &s;harpne&s;s of Style, and full Weight of Rea&s;on, that the Church is deprived of great Jewels in the concealment of them, and that they are not publi&s;h'd to the world.</P>
<P>HE was &s;uperior to all tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions and affections, which attend Vulgar minds, and was guilty of no other ambition than of knowledge, and to be reputed a Lover of all good Men; and that made him too much a contemner of tho&s;e Arts, which mu&s;t be indulged in the tran&s;|actions of human Affairs. In the la&s;t &s;hort Parliament, he was a Bur|ge&s;s in the Hou&s;e of Commons; and, from the Debates which were there
<PB N="272" REF="3170">
managed with all imaginable gravity and &s;obriety, he contracted &s;uch a reverence to Parliaments, that he thought it really impo&s;&s;ible they could ever produce mi&s;chief or inconvenience to the Kingdom; or that the Kingdom could be tolerably happy in the intermi&s;&s;ion of them. And from the unhappy and un&s;ea&s;onable di&s;&s;olution of that Convention, he harbour'd, it may be, &s;ome jealou&s;y and prejudice to the Court, to|wards which he was not Before immoderately inclined; his Father having wa&s;ted a full Fortune there, in tho&s;e offices and employments by which other Men u&s;e to obtain a greater. He was cho&s;en again this Parlia|ment to &s;erve in the &s;ame place, and, in the beginning of it, declared <MILESTONE N="10"> him&s;elf very &s;harply and &s;everely again&s;t tho&s;e exorbitances, which had been mo&s;t grievous to the State; for he was &s;o rigid an ob&s;erver of e&s;ta|bli&s;h'd Laws and Rules, that he could not endure the lea&s;t breach, or deviation from them; and thought no mi&s;chief &s;o intolerable as the pre&s;umption of Mini&s;ters of State, to break po&s;itive Rules, for rea&s;ons of State; or Judges to tran&s;gre&s;s known Laws, upon the Title of Con|veniency, or Nece&s;&s;ity; which made him &s;o &s;evere again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Finch,</HI> contrary to his Natural gentlene&s;s, and temper: in&s;omuch as they, who did not know his compo&s;ition to be as free from Revenge, as it was from Pride, thought that the &s;harpne&s;s to <MILESTONE N="20"> the Former, might proceed from the Memory of &s;ome unkindne&s;&s;es, not without a mixture of Inju&s;tice, from him towards his Father. But without doubt he was free from tho&s;e temptations, and in both ca&s;es was only mi&s;led by the Authority of tho&s;e, who, he believ'd, under&s;tood the Laws perfectly; of which, him&s;elf was utterly ignorant; <Q>and if the a&s;&s;umption, which was then &s;carce controverted, had been true, &startq;that an Endeavour to overthrow the fundamental Laws of the Kingdom&endq; was Trea&s;on,</Q> a &s;trict under&s;tanding might make rea&s;onable conclu|&s;ions to &s;atisfy his own judgement, from the exorbitant parts of their &s;everal Charges. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE great opinion he had of the uprightne&s;s, and integrity of tho&s;e Per&s;ons who appeared mo&s;t active, e&s;pecially of M^r <HI>Hambden,</HI> kept him longer from &s;u&s;pecting any de&s;ign again&s;t the Peace of the Kingdom; and though he differ'd from them commonly in conclu&s;ions, he believ'd long their purpo&s;es were hone&s;t. When he grew better inform'd what was Law, and di&s;cern'd in them a de&s;ire to controule that Law by a Vote of one, or both Hou&s;es, no Man more oppo&s;ed tho&s;e attempts, and gave the adver&s;e Party more trouble by rea&s;on and argumentation; in&s;o|much as he was, by degrees, looked upon as an Advocate for the Court, to which he contributed &s;o little, that he declined tho&s;e addre&s;&s;es, and even tho&s;e Invitations which he was obliged allmo&s;t by civility to enter|tain. And he was &s;o jealous of the lea&s;t imagination that he &s;hould in|cline to Pre&s;erment, that he affected even a moro&s;ene&s;s to the Court, and to the Courtiers; and left nothing undone which might prevent, and divert the King's or Queen's Favour towards him, but the de&s;erving it. <Q>For when the King &s;ent for him once or twice to &s;peak with him, and to give him thanks for his excellent comportment in tho&s;e Coun&s;els, which his Maje&s;ty graciou&s;ly term'd &startq;&endq;doing him Service, his An&s;wers were more negligent, and le&s;s &s;atisfactory, than might be expected;</Q> as if he cared only, that his Actions &s;hould be Ju&s;t, not that they &s;hould be Acceptable, and that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould think that they proceeded only from the impul&s;ion of Con&s;cience, without any &s;ympathy in his Affections; which, from a Stoical and Sullen Nature, might not have
<PB N="273" REF="3180">
been mi&s;interpreted; yet, from a Per&s;on of &s;o perfect a habit of generous, and ob&s;equious complyance with all good Men, might very well have been interpreted by the King as more than an ordinary aver&s;ne&s;s to his Service: &s;o that he took more pains, and more forced his Nature to Actions unagreeable, and unplea&s;ant to it, that he might not be thought to incline to the Court, than mo&s;t Men have done to procure an Office there. And if any thing but not doing his duty, could have kept him from receiving a Te&s;timony of the King's Grace and Tru&s;t at that time, he had not been called to his Council; not that he was in truth aver&s;e from receiving publick Employment; for he had a great devotion to <MILESTONE N="10"> the King's Per&s;on, and had before u&s;ed &s;ome &s;mall endeavour to be re|commended to him for a Forreign Negotiation, and had once a de&s;ire to be &s;ent Emba&s;&s;adour into <HI>France;</HI> but he abhorr'd an imagination or doubt &s;hould &s;ink into the thoughts of any Man, that in the di&s;charge of his tru&s;t and duty in Parliament, he had any bia&s;s to the Court, or that the King him&s;elf &s;hould apprehend, that he looked for a reward for being Hone&s;t.</P>
<P><Q>FOR this rea&s;on, when he heard it fir&s;t whi&s;pered, &startq;that the King&endq; had a purpo&s;e to make him a Privy Coun&s;ellor,</Q> for which there was, in the beginning, no other ground, but becau&s;e he was known &s;ufficient <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>(haud &s;emper errat fama, aliquando &amp; eligit)</HI> he re&s;olv'd to decline it; and at la&s;t &s;uffered him&s;elf only to be overruled, by the advice and per|&s;wa&s;ions of his Friends, to &s;ubmit to it. Afterwards, when he found that the King intended to make him Secretary of State, he was po&s;itive to refu&s;e it; <Q>declaring to his Friends, &startq;that he was mo&s;t unfit for it, and that he mu&s;t either do that which would be great di&s;quiet to his own Nature, or leave that undone which was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to be done by one that was honoured with that place; for the mo&s;t ju&s;t and hone&s;t Men did, every day, that which he could not give him&s;elf leave&endq; to do.</Q> And indeed he was &s;o exact, and &s;trict an Ob&s;erver of Ju&s;tice <MILESTONE N="30"> and Truth, that he believ'd tho&s;e nece&s;&s;ary conde&s;cen&s;ions and applica|tions to the weakne&s;s of other Men, and tho&s;e Arts and In&s;inuations which are nece&s;&s;ary for di&s;coveries, and prevention of ill, would be in Him a declen&s;ion from his own rules of life; though he acknowledged them fit, and ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to be practiced in tho&s;e employments. He was, in truth, &s;o preci&s;e in the practick principles he pre&s;cribed Him|&s;elf (to all others he was as indulgent) as if he had lived <HI>in Republica Platonis, non in faece Romuli.</HI></P>
<P>TWO rea&s;ons prevailed with him to receive the Seales, and but for tho&s;e he had re&s;olutely avoided them. The fir&s;t, the con&s;ideration that <MILESTONE N="$0"> his refu&s;al might bring &s;ome blemi&s;h upon the King's Affairs, and that Men would have believ'd, that he had refu&s;ed &s;o great an Honour and Tru&s;t, becau&s;e he mu&s;t have been with it obliged to do &s;omewhat el&s;e not ju&s;tifiable. And this he made matter of Con&s;cience, &s;ince he knew the King made choice of him, before other Men, e&s;pecially becau&s;e he thought him more hone&s;t than other Men. The other was, le&s;t he might be thought to avoid it out of fear to do an ungracious thing to the Hou&s;e of Commons, who were &s;orely troubled at the di&s;placing S^r <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> whom they looked upon as removed for having done them tho&s;e Offices they &s;tood in need of; and the di&s;dain of &s;o popular an incum|brance <MILESTONE N="$0"> wrought upon him next to the other. For as he had a full ap|petite of fame by ju&s;t and generous Actions, &s;o he had an equal con|tempt of it by any &s;ervile expedients: and he &s;o much the more con&s;ented
<PB N="274" REF="3190">
to, and approved the Ju&s;tice upon S^r <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> in his own private judgement, by how much he &s;urpa&s;&s;ed mo&s;t Men in the Religious ob|&s;ervation of a Tru&s;t; the violation whereof he would not admit of any excu&s;e for.</P>
<P>FOR the&s;e rea&s;ons, he &s;ubmitted to the King's Command, and be|came his Secretary, with as humble and devoted an acknowledgement of the greatne&s;s of the obligation, as could be expre&s;&s;ed, and as true a &s;en&s;e of it in his heart. Yet two things he could never bring him&s;elf to, whil&s;t he continued in that Office, that was to his death; for which he was contented to be reproached, as for omi&s;&s;ions in a mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary <MILESTONE N="10"> part of his place. The one, employing of Spies, or giving any counte|nance, or entertainment to them. I do not mean &s;uch Emi&s;&s;aries, as with danger would venture to view the Enemies Camp, and bring In|telligence of their Number, or quartering, or any particulars that &s;uch an ob&s;ervation can comprehend; but tho&s;e, who by communication of Guilt, or Di&s;&s;imulation of manners, wind them&s;elves into &s;uch Tru&s;ts and Secrets, as enable them to make di&s;coveries. The other, the Li|berty of opening Letters, upon a &s;u&s;picion that they might contain matter of dangerous con&s;equence. <Q>For the fir&s;t, he would &s;ay, &startq;&s;uch In&s;truments mu&s;t be void of all Ingenuity, and common Hone&s;ty, be|fore <MILESTONE N="20"> they could be of u&s;e; and afterwards they could never be fit to be credited: and that no &s;ingle pre&s;ervation could be worth &s;o general a wound, and corruption of humane &s;ociety, as the cheri&s;hing &s;uch&endq; Per&s;ons would carry with it.</Q> <Q>The la&s;t, he thought &startq;&s;uch a violation of the Law of Nature, that no qualification by Office could ju&s;tify him&endq; in the tre&s;pa&s;s;</Q> and though he was convinced by the nece&s;&s;ity, and iniquity of the time, that tho&s;e advantages of information were not to be declined, and were nece&s;&s;arily to be practiced, he found means to put it off from him&s;elf; whil&s;t he confe&s;&s;ed he needed excu&s;e and par|don for the omi&s;&s;ion; &s;o unwilling he was to re&s;ign any part of good <MILESTONE N="30"> Nature to an obligation in his Office.</P>
<P>IN all other particulars he filled his place with great &s;ufficiency, be|ing well ver&s;ed in Languages, to under&s;tand any that are u&s;ed in bu&s;i|ne&s;s, and to make him&s;elf again under&s;tood. To &s;peak of his Integrity, and his high di&s;dain of any bait that might &s;eem to look towards cor|ruption, <HI>in tanto viro, injuria virtutum fuerit.</HI> Some &s;harp expre&s;&s;ions he u&s;ed again&s;t the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury,</HI> and his concurring in the fir&s;t Bill to take away the Votes of Bi&s;hops in the Hou&s;e of Peers, gave occa&s;ion to &s;ome to believe, and opportunity to others to conclude, <Q>and publi&s;h, &startq;that he was no friend to the Church, and the e&s;tabli&s;h'd&endq; Government of it;</Q> and troubled his very Friends much, who were more confident of the contrary, than prepared to An&s;wer the Alle|gations.</P>
<P>THE truth is, he had unhappily contracted &s;ome prejudice to the Arch-Bi&s;hop; and having ob&s;erv'd his Pa&s;&s;ion, when, it may be, multi|plicity of bu&s;ine&s;s, or other indi&s;po&s;ition had po&s;&s;e&s;s'd him, did wi&s;h him le&s;s intangled and engaged in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Court, or State though, I &s;peak it knowingly, he had a &s;ingular e&s;timation and reverenc$ of his great Learning, and confe&s;&s;ed Integrity; and really thought hi$ own letting him&s;elf loo&s;e to tho&s;e expre&s;&s;ions which implied a di&s;e&s;tee$ of the Arch-Bi&s;hop, or at lea&s;t an acknowledgment of his Infirmitie$ would enable him to &s;helter him from part of the &s;torm he &s;aw rai&s;e for his de&s;truction; which he abominated with his Soul.</P>

<P><PB N="275" REF="3210">
THE giving his con&s;ent to the fir&s;t Bill for the di&s;placing the Bi&s;hops, did proceed from two grounds: The fir&s;t, his not under&s;tanding Then the Original of their Right and Suffrage there: the other, an opinion, that the combination again&s;t the whole Government of the Church by Bi&s;hops, was &s;o violent and furious, that a le&s;s compo&s;ition than the di&s;pencing with their intermedling in Secular Affairs, would not pre|&s;erve the Order. <Q>And he was per&s;waded to this by the profe&s;&s;ion of many Per&s;ons of Honour, who declared, &startq;they did de&s;ire the one, and&endq; would not then pre&s;s the other;</Q> which, in that particular, mi&s;led many Men. But when his ob&s;ervation and experience made him di&s;cern <MILESTONE N="10"> more of their Intentions, than he before &s;u&s;pected, with great frank|ne&s;s he oppo&s;ed the &s;econd Bill that was preferr'd for that purpo&s;e; and had, without &s;cruple, the order it &s;elf in perfect reverence; and thought too great Encouragement could not po&s;&s;ibly be given to Learning, nor too great Rewards to Learned Men. He was never, in the lea&s;t degree, &s;wayed or moved by the objections which were made again&s;t that Go|vernment in the Church (holding them mo&s;t ridiculous) or affected to the other, which tho&s;e Men fancied to them&s;elves.</P>
<P>HE had a Courage of the mo&s;t clear and keen tempe$ and &s;o far from fear, that he &s;eem'd not without &s;ome Appetite of danger; and there|fore, <MILESTONE N="20"> upon any occa&s;ion of Action, he allways engaged his Per&s;on in tho&s;e Troops which he thought, by the forwardne&s;s of the Commanders, to be mo&s;t like to be farthe&s;t engaged; and in all &s;uch Encounters, he had about him an extraordinary chearfulne&s;s, without at all affecting the execution that u&s;ually attended them; in which he took no delight, but took pains to prevent it, where it was not, by re&s;i&s;tance, made ne|ce&s;&s;ary: in&s;omuch that at <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> when the Enemy was Routed, he was like to have incurr'd great Peril, by interpo&s;ing to &s;ave tho&s;e who had thrown away their Armes, and again&s;t whom, it may be, others were more fierce for their having thrown them away: &s;o that a Man <MILESTONE N="30"> might think, he came into the Field chiefly out of Curio&s;ity to &s;ee the face of Danger, and Charity to prevent the &s;hedding of Blood. Yet in his natural inclination he acknowledged he was addicted to the profe&s;|&s;ion of a Soldier; and &s;hortly after he came to his Fortune, before he was of Age, he went into the Low Countries, with a re&s;olution of pro|curing Command, and to give him&s;elf up to it; from which he was di|verted by the compleat inactivity of that Summer: So he return'd in|to <HI>England,</HI> and &s;hortly after enter'd upon that vehement cour&s;e of Study we mention'd before, till the fir&s;t Alarm from the North; then again he made ready for the Field, and though he receiv'd &s;ome repul&s;e <MILESTONE N="40"> in the Command of a Troop of Hor&s;e, of which he had a promi&s;e, he went a Voluntier with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>FROM the Entrance into this unnatural War, his natural chearful|ne&s;s and vivacity grew clouded, and a kind of &s;adne&s;s, and dejection of Spirit &s;tole upon him, which he had never been u&s;ed to: yet being one of tho&s;e who believ'd that one Battle would end all differences, and that there would be &s;o great a Victory on one Side, that the Other would be compelled to &s;ubmit to any conditions from the Victor (which &s;up|po&s;ition and conclu&s;ion generally &s;unk into the minds of mo&s;t Men, and prevented the looking after many advantages that might then have been laid hold of) he re&s;i&s;ted tho&s;e indi&s;po&s;itions, <HI>&amp; in luctu, bellum inter remedia erat.</HI> But after the King's return from <HI>Brentford,</HI> and the &s;urious re&s;olution of the two Hou&s;es not to admit any Treaty for
<PB N="276" REF="3220">
Peace, tho&s;e indi&s;po&s;itions, which had before touched him, grew into a perfect habit of unchearfulne&s;s; and He, who had been &s;o exactly ea&s;y, and affable to all Men, that his face and countenance was allways pre&s;ent, and vacant to his Company, and held any cloudine&s;s, and le&s;s plea&s;antne&s;s of the vi&s;age, a kind of rudene&s;s or incivility, became, on a &s;uddain, le&s;s communicable; and thence, very &s;ad, pale, and exceed|ingly affected with the Spleen. In his Cloaths and Habit, which he had minded before allways with more neatne&s;s, and indu&s;try, and expence, than is u&s;ual to &s;o great a Soul, he was not now only incurious, but too negligent; and in his reception of Suitors, and the nece&s;&s;ary, or ca|&s;ual <MILESTONE N="10"> Addre&s;&s;es to his place, &s;o quick, and &s;harp, and &s;evere, that there wanted not &s;ome Men (&s;trangers to his nature and di&s;po&s;ition) who be|liev'd him proud and imperious; from which no mortal Man was ever more free.</P>
<P>IT is true, that as he was of a mo&s;t incomparable gentlene&s;s, appli|cation, and even &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to good, and worthy, and entire Men, &s;o he was naturally (which could not but be more evident in his Place, which objected him to another conver&s;ation, and intermixture, than his own election would have done) <HI>adver&s;us malos injucundus;</HI> and was &s;o ill a di&s;&s;embler of his di&s;like, and di&s;inclination to ill Men, that it <MILESTONE N="20"> was not po&s;&s;ible for Such not to di&s;cern it. There was once, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, &s;uch a declared acceptation of the good Service an eminent Member had done to Them, and, as they &s;aid, <Q>to the whole Kingdom, that it was moved, he being pre&s;ent, &startq;that the Speaker might, in the name of the whole Hou&s;e, give him thanks; and then, that every Member might, as a te&s;timony of his particular acknowledg|ment,&endq; &s;tir or move his hat towards him;</Q> the which (though not or|der'd) when very many did, the Lord <HI>Falkland</HI> (who believ'd the Ser|vice it &s;elf not to be of that moment, and that an honourable and ge|nerous Per&s;on could not have &s;tooped to it for any recompence) in&s;tead <MILESTONE N="30"> of moving his hat, &s;tretched both his Armes out, and cla&s;ped his hands together upon the Crown of his hat, and held it clo&s;e down to his head; that all Men might &s;ee, how odious that flattery was to him, and the very approbation of the Per&s;on, though at that time mo&s;t popular.</P>
<P>WHEN there was any Overture, or hope of Peace, he would be more erect, and vigorous, and exceedingly &s;ollicitous to pre&s;s any thing which he thought might promote it; and &s;itting among his Friends, often, after a deep &s;ilence, and frequent &s;ighs, would, with a &s;hrill and &s;ad ac|cent, ingeminate the word <HI>Peace, Peace;</HI> <Q>and would pa&s;&s;ionately pro|fe&s;s, &startq;that the very agony of the War, and the view of the calamities <MILESTONE N="40"> and de&s;olation the Kingdom did, and mu&s;t endure, took his &s;leep from&endq; him, and would &s;hortly break his heart.</Q> <Q>This made &s;ome think, or pretend to think, &startq;that he was &s;o much enamoured on Peace, that he&endq; would have been glad, the King &s;hould have bought it at any price;</Q> which was a mo&s;t unrea&s;onable Calumny.

<P>IN the morning before the Battle, as allways upon Action, he was very chearful, and put him&s;elf into the fir&s;t rank of the Lord <HI>Byron</HI>'s Regiment, then advancing upon the Enemy, who had lined the Hedges <MILESTONE N="10"> on both &s;ides with Mu&s;queteers; from whence he was &s;hot with a Mu&s;|quet in the lower part of the Belly, and in the in&s;tant falling from his Hor&s;e, his Body was not found till the next morning; till when, there was &s;ome hope he might have been a Pri&s;oner; though his neare&s;t Friends, who knew his temper, receiv'd &s;mall comfort from that ima|gination.

<P>NOW to go on with the Cour&s;e of our Hi&s;tory: the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>returns to</HI> London</NOTE> enter'd into <HI>London</HI> on the 25^t^h of <HI>September</HI> (a day we &s;hall have occa|&s;ion to remember upon another &s;olemnity) and was the next day vi&s;ited, at <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> Hou&s;e, <Q>by the Speaker and the whole Hou&s;e of Commons, who declared to him, &startq;that they came to congratulate his notable &s;ucce&s;s, and to render the thanks of the Kingdom to him, for his incomparable Conduct and Courage; and that they had cau&s;ed their acknowledge|ment to be enter'd in their Journal Book, as a monument and record&endq; of His Virtue, and Their gratitude.</Q> A day or two after, &s;olemn thanks <MILESTONE N="30"> were render'd to tho&s;e Members of both Hou&s;es who had Command in the Army, and &s;ome extraordinary &s;ignification of re&s;pect derived to the Superior Officers, throughout the Army.

after this Battle, as is before related (It kept the Field, and had the &s;poil of it; It took &s;ome Pieces of the Enemies Cannon, who march'd off in the Night, and were pur&s;ued with &s;ome con&s;iderable lo&s;s beyond <HI>Reading,</HI> where a Garri&s;on was again placed for his Maje&s;ty, under the Command of S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hley,</HI> Major General of the Army, an excel|lent Officer; &s;o that the Parliament was in &s;o much a wor&s;e State than they were in the Spring, as the lo&s;s of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and mo&s;t of the We&s;t amounted to; for by this time <HI>Exeter</HI> was likewi&s;e reduced by Prince <HI>Maurice)</HI> yet, notwith&s;tanding all this, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> as is &s;aid be|fore, was receiv'd at <HI>London</HI> with all imaginable Gratulation and <MILESTONE N="10"> Triumph; he had done all that was expected from him, with many cir|cum&s;tances of great, Soldierly, and notable Courage, and the heart and &s;pirit of the Parliament was vi&s;ibly much exalted, and their impatience for Peace quite abated.</P>
<P>ON the contrary, upon the King's return to <HI>Oxford,</HI> there appear'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Temper of the Army, and the Court at</HI> Oxford, <HI>upon the return of the King thi|ther.</HI></NOTE> nothing but dejection of mind, di&s;content, and &s;ecret Mutiny in the Army, Anger and Jealou&s;y among the Officers, every one accu&s;ing an|other of want of Courage and Conduct in the Actions of the Field; and they who were not of the Army, blaming them all for their &s;everal failings and gro&s;s over&s;ights. The Siege of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> was not believ'd <MILESTONE N="20"> to have been well conducted, and that it might have been taken in half the time they were before it, if it had been skilfully gone about. The not engaging the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> in all the march over &s;o open a Country, was thought unexcu&s;able, and was imputed to the want of Courage in <HI>Wilmot;</HI> whom Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> did in no degree favour: nor was the Prince him&s;elf without &s;ome reproaches, for &s;uffering the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> after all the Hor&s;e was joyn'd, to march down a long &s;teep Hill into the Vale of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> without any di&s;turbance; and that the whole Army, when it was found nece&s;&s;ary to quit the Siege, had not been brought to Fight in that Vale, and at &s;ome di&s;tance from the Town, when the King's <MILESTONE N="$0"> Men were fre&s;h, and the other Side tired with &s;o long a March.</P>
<P>BUT then all Men renewed their execrations again&s;t tho&s;e who ad|vi&s;ed the &s;itting down before <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> the Officers, who had been pre&s;ent, and con&s;enting to all the Coun&s;els, di&s;claiming as much as any, the whole de&s;ign; and all con&s;pired to lay the whole reproach upon the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, who &s;poke mo&s;t in tho&s;e Debates, and was not at all gracious to the Soldiers: and this clamour again&s;t that Engagement was &s;o popular, and univer&s;al, that no Man took upon him&s;elf to &s;peak in Defence of it; though, be&s;ides the rea&s;ons which have been formerly alledged for it, what happen'd in this la&s;t Action, in the relief of <HI>Glou|ce&s;ter,</HI> <MILESTONE N="$0"> might well &s;eem to ju&s;tify it; for &s;ince it appear'd, that the City was &s;o much united to the Parliament, that it &s;upplied their Army with &s;uch a Body of their Train'd-bands (without which it could never have march'd) with what &s;ucce&s;s could his Maje&s;ty have approached <HI>London,</HI> after the taking of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> with his hara&s;&s;ed Army? and would not the whole Body of the Train'd-bands have defended That, when &s;o con&s;i|derable a part of them could be per&s;waded to undertake a March of two hundred Miles? for le&s;s they did not March&punc; from the time they went out, to that in which they return'd. But no rea&s;on could ever convert tho&s;e, who look'd upon that undertaking at <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> as the ruin of <MILESTONE N="50"> the King's Affairs.</P>
<P>THE temper of the Court was no better than that of the Army; and the King was &s;o much troubled with both, that he did not enjoy the
<PB N="279" REF="3250">
quiet his condition required. They who had forborne to be importu|nate for Honours, or Offices, becau&s;e they knew they &s;hould not be able to obtain their de&s;ires from the King, made their Mode&s;ty an ar|gument of their Merit to the Queen; <Q>and a&s;&s;ured her, &startq;that they had for borne to ask any thing in Her ab&s;ence, becau&s;e they had allways re|&s;olv'd&endq; never to receive any thing, but by Her bounty.</Q> Many pre|tended former promi&s;es and engagements for Creations of Honour, a&s;|&s;oon as any thing &s;hould be done of that kind. And it is true enough, that both their Maje&s;ties had given them&s;elves ea&s;e from pre&s;ent im|portunities, by making promi&s;es, with reference to a time, which they <MILESTONE N="10"> imagined, and, at that time, re&s;olv'd &s;hould not be &s;oon: and now there was no &s;ooner mention of conferring Honour upon one or two whom they had a mind to gratify, but the re&s;t who had that promi&s;e, were very importunate and clamorous for the &s;ame Ju&s;tice. By this means they were, upon the matter, compell'd to gratify &s;ome Men to whom they bore no good will; and &s;o, they who receiv'd the favours were no more plea&s;ed, than they were who conferr'd them; and they who were without Ambition before, when they &s;aw Honours and Offices conferr'd upon Men, who, they thought, did not merit them $etter than them|&s;elves, thought their Service undervalued if they did not receive the <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;ame reward. <Q>And it was a u&s;ual Prologue to &s;uites of that kind, &startq;that they did not de&s;ire it out of their own ambition, but purely to &s;atisfy their Friends; who withdrew their kindne&s;s from them, out of an opinion that they had offended the King, who would not otherwi&s;e&endq; put &s;o great a difference between Them and other Men.</Q> Whence it may be ob&s;erv'd, that Princes &s;hould not confer publick rewards in a &s;ea&s;on when they can only gratify Few, and &s;o Many &s;tand upon the &s;ame level in pretences, that they are apt to re&s;ent the preferring of One, as an affront and di&s;obligation to the re&s;t.</P>
<P>THERE was no particular that gave the King more unquietne&s;s, <MILESTONE N="30"> than the pretence of my Lord of <HI>Holland.</HI> The three Earls I before mention'd, had attended the King before he ro&s;e from <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and had waited upon him throughout that march, and had Charged the Enemy, in the King's Regiment of Hor&s;e, at the Battle of <HI>Newbury,</HI> very bravely; and had behaved them&s;elves, throughout, very well; and return'd to <HI>Oxford</HI> with his Maje&s;ty; and now expected to be well look'd upon: and the other Two had no cau&s;e to complain; the King, upon all occa&s;ions, &s;poke very graciou&s;ly to them, <Q>and particularly &s;ent the Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Earl of <HI>Clare,</HI> &startq;that he had liberty,&endq; and might be pre&s;ent at the Councils of War;</Q> where the Peers u&s;ually <MILESTONE N="40"> were, and where the general matters of contribution, and &s;uch things as concern'd the Country, were u&s;ually debated. But the Earl of <HI>Hol|land</HI> was not plea&s;ed; he thought nothing of former Mi&s;carriages ought to be remember'd; that all tho&s;e were cancelled by the Merit of coming to the King Now, and bringing &s;uch con&s;iderable Per&s;ons with him, and di&s;po&s;ing others to follow; and expected, upon his fir&s;t appearance, to have had his Key re&s;tored to him; to have been in the &s;ame condi|tion he was in the Bed-Chamber, and in the Council, and in the King's Grace and Countenance; of all which he had a&s;&s;urance from the Queen before he came, at lea&s;t from M^r <HI>Jermyn,</HI> who, no doubt, did exceed <MILESTONE N="50"> his Commi&s;&s;ion; and the very deferring of this, was grievous to him; and the more, becau&s;e he found the &s;ame di&s;re&s;pect from all others, as he had done when he came fir&s;t to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P><PB N="280" REF="3260">
HE came frequently in the afternoon to <HI>Merton</HI> College; where the Queen lay, and where the King was for the mo&s;t part at that time of the day, and both their Maje&s;ties look'd well upon him, and &s;poke to him in publick as occa&s;ion was admini&s;ter'd. Sometimes the King went a&s;ide with him to the Window, in the &s;ame Room, where they &s;poke a quarter or half an hour together, out of the hearing of any body; which the Queen did often in the &s;ame manner; and M^r <HI>Jermyn,</HI> who was about this time made a Baron, was very frequently with him. The King was allways upon his guard towards him, and did not, in truth, abate any thing of his former rigour or prejudice, and continued firm <MILESTONE N="10"> to his former re&s;olutions. But the Queen, whether from her inclination, or promi&s;e, or di&s;like of mo&s;t other People, who were not &s;o good Cour|tiers (as &s;ure none was equal to Him in that function and my&s;tery) did in truth heartily de&s;ire, that he might receive &s;atisfaction in all things, according to his own de&s;ire; and would have tru&s;ted him her &s;elf as much as formerly. Yet &s;he complied &s;o far with the King's aver&s;ion, that &s;he yet forbore to pre&s;s it, or to own the encouragement &s;he had given him; nor had &s;he a willingne&s;s to oppo&s;e &s;o great a torrent of pre|judice, as &s;he &s;aw evidently run again&s;t him; &s;o that &s;he appear'd not to wi&s;h, what without doubt &s;he would have been very glad of. How|ever <MILESTONE N="20"> the Marquis of <HI>Hertford</HI> was now come to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and expected the performance of the King's promi&s;e to him, and to be admitted into the Office of Groom of the Stole; of which the King took not the lea&s;t notice to him &s;ince his return; which made it the more &s;u&s;pected, that the intention was to readmit the old Officer; and this apprehen&s;ion was confirm'd by the Queen's looking le&s;s graciou&s;ly upon the Marquis, than &s;he had u&s;ed to do. And it is true, though it may be &s;he did not intend to make any &s;uch di&s;covery by her looks, &s;he was not plea&s;ed that any &s;uch promi&s;e was made, both becau&s;e it was without Her Con|&s;ent, and as it cro&s;&s;ed what &s;he de&s;ign'd; and much de&s;ired that the <MILESTONE N="30"> Marquis could have been per&s;waded to have relea&s;ed it; towards which the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> with &s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, &s;poke to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, <Q>&startq;how unrea&s;onable a thing it was for the Marquis, who&endq; was Ma&s;ter of &s;o great a Fortune,</Q> <Q>to affect &s;uch a low preferment (as he term'd it) &startq;&endq; and how generous a thing it would be to quit his pre|tence:</Q> but he quickly di&s;cover'd him not to be willing to engage in any &s;uch Propo&s;ition. All this wonderfully indi&s;po&s;ed the other Lords, and the Per&s;ons of Quality in the Town, who did not wi&s;h to &s;ee the Court ju&s;t filled as it had been, or the Queen Her &s;elf po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of &s;o ab&s;olute a power, as &s;he had been formerly; though they looked upon her Per|&s;on <MILESTONE N="40"> with all Duty and Reverence.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> did not act his own part with that art and dex|terity, which might have been expected from his cunning and expe|rience; nor had ever made the lea&s;t Apology to the King for any thing he had formerly done; nor appear'd to have the lea&s;t &s;en&s;e that he had committed any error, as his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf declared to tho&s;e, who he knew were his Friends; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;that he behaved him&s;elf with the &s;ame Confidence, and A&s;&s;urance, as he had done when he was mo&s;t in his favour; and that he retain'd &s;till the old Artifice at Court, to be &s;een to whi&s;per in the King's and Queen's ear, by which People thought there was &s;ome &s;ecret, when the matter of tho&s;e whi&s;pers was nothing but what might be &s;aid in the open Court; and that the Earl of <HI>Hol+land</HI> had &s;everal times &s;eem'd to de&s;ire, to &s;ay &s;omewhat in private to
<PB N="281" REF="3270">
him, upon which he had withdrawn from the Company to the end or corner of the Room, and, at fir&s;t, expected and apprehended, that he would &s;ay &s;omewhat in his own excu&s;e; but that he had never then &s;aid one word, but what he might have &s;poke in the Circle; with&endq; which,</Q> <Q>the King &s;aid, &startq;he was the better plea&s;ed; and that he believ'd, he had not been more particular in his di&s;cour&s;e with the Queen, &s;ave that he u&s;ed to entertain Her with the wi&s;dome and power of the Par|liament, and what great things they would be able to do, and how much they were re&s;pected in Forreign Parts; which, his Maje&s;ty &s;aid, was a &s;trange di&s;cour&s;e for a Man to make, who had &s;o lately left them,&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> becau&s;e he thought the King's condition to be the better of the two.</Q></P>
<P>THE Earl had a Friend who did heartily de&s;ire to do him all the Of|fices, and Services, that would con&s;i&s;t with the King's Honour, and all|ways apprehended the ill con&s;equence of di&s;couraging &s;uch conver&s;ions, and who &s;poke often to the Earl of his own Affairs. And when he com|plain'd of his u&s;age, and repeated, what promi&s;es and encouragement he had receiv'd to come to the King, <Q>and of what importance his good reception would have been, &startq;that there were many of con&s;iderable Re|putation, and Intere&s;t in the Hou&s;e of Commons (whom he named) who intended to have follow'd; and that the Earl of <HI>Northumberland&endq;</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> expected only His advice;</Q> <Q>his Friend asked him, &startq;whether he had done all things, &s;ince he came to the King, which might rea&s;onably&endq; be expected from him?</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he thought he had done all could be expected from him, in bringing him&s;elf to the King; and, &s;ince his coming to him, in venturing his life for him; and in lieu thereof he had not receiv'd Thanks, or one gracious word; and now, after his Office had been kept unbe&s;tow'd near two years, and a promi&s;e made to him, that he &s;hould be re&s;tored to it, it was to be be&s;tow'd upon another, to make his di&s;grace the more notorious; which he thought&endq; would not prove for his Maje&s;ties Honour or Advantage.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>HIS Friend asked him, whether he had asked it of the King, or in|form'd him of the promi&s;e that was made to him? <Q>He &s;aid &startq;he Had done neither, nor ever Would; he expected it of the King's Grace, and would not extort it by a promi&s;e, which, it might be, his Maje&s;ty&endq; was not privy to.</Q> <Q>The other replied very plainly to him, &startq;that if he thought he had never committed any fault again&s;t the King, he had no rea&s;on to acknowledge it, or make excu&s;e for it; but if he were con&s;cious of any &s;uch, how unwarily &s;oever it had been done, or how unmaliciou&s;ly &s;oever it had been intended, he ought to make &s;ome confe&s;&s;ion, and apology to his Maje&s;ty; nor could his Maje&s;ty, with <MILESTONE N="$0"> the &s;afety of his Honour, avow the receiving him into any tru&s;t with|out it; nor was he capable of receiving any Offices from his Friends, or the Queen's own declared interpo&s;ition on his behalf, till he had&endq; perform'd that nece&s;&s;ary Introduction.</Q> <Q>He told him, &startq;if he would&endq; follow His advice,</Q> he believ'd he might receive &s;ome effect of it, <Q>which was, &startq;that he &s;hould &s;end to de&s;ire a private Audience of his Maje&s;ty in &s;ome Room, where no body might be pre&s;ent; which would not be refu&s;ed him; and then he &s;hould (with all the excu&s;es upon the terror the Parliament gave to all Men, who had exceeded the com|mon Rules, in their Admini&s;tration of the tru&s;t they had from his Ma|je&s;ty; as he could not deny He had done in many particulars for the advancement of his Maje&s;ties Service) confe&s;s, that he had not been hardy enough to contemn that power, but had been &s;o much in awe
<PB N="282" REF="3280">
of it, that he cho&s;e rather to pre&s;ume upon his Maje&s;ties goodne&s;s, than to provoke Their jealou&s;y and di&s;plea&s;ure; and &s;o had complied with them more, than in his duty and gratitude to his Maje&s;ty he ought to have done; for which he begged his pardon upon his knees; and if he might obtain it, he made no doubt, he &s;hould wipe out the memory of pa&s;t Offences by &s;ome new &s;ervices, which &s;hould be be|neficial&endq; to his Maje&s;ty;</Q> <Q>and he added, &startq;that he would do very well, if he would &s;ue out his pardon, as the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> had done; who had asked it of the King when he fir&s;t ki&s;&s;ed his hand, and had &s;ince&endq; wi&s;ely taken it out under the Great Seal of <HI>England.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Holland</HI> &s;eem'd not at all plea&s;ed with this advice; <Q>&s;aid, <MILESTONE N="10"> &startq;he did not think&punc; though he would not ju&s;tify all that he had done, his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions were of that magnitude, that they required &s;uch a for|mality of asking Pardon; that His ca&s;e was very different from that of the Earl of <HI>Bedford,</HI> who had been in Armes, and a General Of|ficer in the Field again&s;t the King; whereas He had only &s;at in the Par|liament, as lawfully he might do; and if he had failed in his attendance upon his Maje&s;ty, and otherwi&s;e de&s;erv'd his di&s;plea&s;ure, he had re|ceiv'd &s;o many marks of it before he de&s;erv'd it, that might well tran&s;|port a very faithful Servant into a di&s;content. That a&s;&s;oon as he found <MILESTONE N="20"> him&s;elf re&s;tored to any proportion of his Maje&s;ties grace and con|fidence, his own inclination would carry him to as humble Apologies, and as deep acknowledgements of all his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, as could be expected from him, and &s;uch as he believ'd would reconcile the King's goodne&s;s to him: but to make the fir&s;t advance by &s;uch a kind of &s;ub|mi&s;&s;ion,&endq; he did not think he could prevail over him&s;elf to do it.</Q> How|ever, he took his advice very kindly, and &s;poke often with him after upon the &s;ame Subject.</P>

<P><Q>FOR &s;uch an expedient therefore, they propo&s;ed, &startq;that a Covenant <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Covenant propo&s;ed by the</HI> Scots <HI>be|tween the two Kingdoms, and agreed to:</HI></NOTE> might be agreed upon between the two Kingdoms, for the utter ex|tirpation of Prelacy, which that Kingdom was &s;atisfied to be a great ob&s;truction to the Reformation of Religion; and the two Hou&s;es of Parliament had di&s;cover'd a &s;ufficient aver&s;ion from that Government, by having pa&s;&s;ed a Bill for their utter abolition, and in the place thereof to erect &s;uch a Government, as &s;hould be mo&s;t agreeable to Gods Word, which they doubted not would be their own Presbytery; and that the People being cemented together by &s;uch an obligation, would never&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> be &s;ever'd and disjoyn'd by any temptation.</Q></P>
<P>THERE was an ea&s;y con&s;ent, from the Committee of the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> to any expedient that might throughly engage the other Nation; and &s;o a form of words were quickly agreed on between them, for a perfect combination and marriage between the Parliament and the <HI>Scots,</HI> in all &s;uch particulars, as were mo&s;t like to be unacceptable to the King; and this form being pre&s;ently communicated to the Convention of E&s;tates, and the A&s;&s;embly, as &s;oon found an approbation and concurrence there, with as much &s;olemnity, as was nece&s;&s;ary to &s;hew their temper and re|&s;olution, and to gain the con&s;ent of the two Hou&s;es at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> whither it was di&s;patched with all imaginable celerity, <Q>and a &s;ignifica|tion &startq;that that People were in &s;uch a forwardne&s;s to advance, that they&endq; would be in <HI>England</HI> a&s;&s;oon as they could be rea&s;onably expected.</Q>

<P><Q>MANY were of opinion, that this engagement was propo&s;ed &startq;rather to decline being engaged in the Quarrel, than out of hope or imagina|tion that the two Hou&s;es would concur with them; for though there had been a Bill pa&s;&s;ed, before the la&s;t Treaty with the King, to that purpo&s;e, yet they well knew that mo&s;t of the Peers, and Per&s;ons of Quality and Intere&s;t in the other Hou&s;e, were willing to depart from <MILESTONE N="10"> that Overture.

However, it would vi&s;ibly take up &s;o much time, that if there were no Ebb in the King's pro&s;perity and &s;ucce&s;s, he might well fini&s;h his work, and this $nterpo&s;ition be&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> interpreted for a politick Stratagem to amu&s;e the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI></Q> But if this was their Stratagem, they met with People too frank hearted, and not &s;crupulous to contribute towards it: for the draught of the Covenant no &s;ooner came to <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> but they &s;hewed a marvellous inclina|tion to it. Yet as well becau&s;e it was not yet known, what &s;ucce&s;s the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> would have in the relief of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> which was like to have a &s;hrew'd influence upon Men's Affections and Con&s;ciences, as that they might &s;eem to u&s;e all nece&s;&s;ary deliberation, and caution, for the information of their Judgements in a new ca&s;e, that concern'd the Re|ligion, and Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Fabrick of the Kingdom, they tran&s;mitted it <MILESTONE N="30"> to their A&s;&s;embly of Divines, <Q>to return Their opinion &startq;of the lawful|ne&s;s&endq; of taking it in point of Con&s;cience.</Q></P>

<P>ASSOON as this &s;olemnity was over, which was concluded by M^r <HI>Hender&s;on</HI> (the &s;ole Eccle&s;ia&s;tical Commi&s;&s;ioner from the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland)</HI> who magnified what they had done, <Q>and a&s;&s;ured them &startq;of great &s;ucce&s;s after it, by the experience of that Nation, who, from their Union in their fir&s;t Covenant, found nothing hard they propo&s;ed to&endq; them&s;elves;</Q> <Q>and told them, &startq;that were that Covenant now painted upon the Wall within the Pope's Palace, it would doubtle&s;s put him&endq; into <HI>Bel&s;hazzar</HI>'s quaking condition;</Q> the Speaker and Commons <MILESTONE N="40"> (having fir&s;t &s;et their hands to the Covenant, after they had taken it) return'd to their Hou&s;e, and ob&s;erving, that many of their Members were that day ab&s;ent, the cau&s;e whereof was ea&s;y to be gue&s;&s;ed, <Q>they order'd, &startq;that, a&s;&s;oon as they came into the Hou&s;e, the Covenant &s;hould be tender'd to them, and who&s;oever refu&s;ed to take it, &s;hould be pro|ceeded again&s;t, as a di&s;affected Per&s;on, in &s;uch manner as the Hou&s;e&endq; &s;hould think fit.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEY farther made a &s;pecial Order, &startq;that all the Mini&s;ters of Pari&s;h <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Covenant order'd to be taken by o|thers, e&s;pecial|ly by the City.</NOTE> Churches within <HI>London,</HI> and <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> the Suburbs, and the whole line of Communication, &s;hould read and explain the Covenant <MILESTONE N="$0"> to their &s;everal Congregations, and &s;tir them up, the next Fa&s;t day, to the chearful taking of it: and particular care was taken, that all the&endq; Students of the Inns of Court &s;hould be per&s;waded to receive it.</Q> But
<PB N="290" REF="3370">
over and above the&s;e general directions, there was a particular cere|mony, and application to recommend this Covenant to the City, and Corporation of <HI>London,</HI> and another u&s;e to be made of it. The Cove|nant was not only to bring, but to keep Men together; and the taking it had only inclined the <HI>Scots,</HI> to march to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance; they were to have one hundred thou&s;and pounds Advanced to them, and paid at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> before they could &s;tir; and how to advance this great Sum, was not ea&s;y to re&s;olve. All their Ordinances for levying of Mo|ney were expired; their I&s;&s;ues and Disbur&s;ments &s;o va&s;t, that no income was &s;ufficient; their Exchequer was exhau&s;ted, and even their Publick <MILESTONE N="10"> faith Bankrupt: &s;uch Anticipations upon all kind of receipts, for Mo|nies borrowed, and already &s;pent, that they had no Capitol for future Security.</P>
<P>THE Judicature of the Hou&s;e of Peers (though their Number was but ten, for there was no more at the Sentence of Ju&s;tice <HI>Berkley)</HI> had helped them all they could. Ju&s;tice <HI>Berkley,</HI> who had been committed by them to the Tower, &s;hortly after the beginning of the Parliament, upon a Charge of High Trea&s;on, and &s;ince the beginning of the War, permitted to &s;it as &s;ole Judge in the King's Bench, one whole Term, was now brought to Judgement; and by their Lord&s;hips fined the Sum <MILESTONE N="20"> of twenty thou&s;and pounds, and made incapable of any place of Judi|cature; and upon abatement of half, and his Liberty, he paid the other ten thou&s;and pounds together, to tho&s;e Per&s;ons they appointed to re|ceive it; which, &s;ince all fines are due to the King alone, and cannot be di&s;po&s;ed but by him, many thought a greater crime than that for which he was &s;entenced. Baron <HI>Trevor,</HI> who was fined for the &s;ame Offence, and &s;uffer'd &s;till to continue the &s;ame Office, in which he had committed his mi&s;demeanour, yeilded them as much more. But the&s;e petty Sums were di&s;po&s;ed before they were receiv'd, and were but &s;mall drops to quench the great drougth they &s;u&s;tain'd: &s;o that the reputation and &s;e|curity <MILESTONE N="30"> of this Covenant, was, among&s;t other U&s;es, to bring in Mo|ney too.</P>
<P>TO that purpo&s;e, a Committee of Lords and Commons, with &s;ome of their Divines of the A&s;&s;embly, was &s;ent to the <HI>Guild-Hall,</HI> where the Mayor had called a Common Council for their reception, <Q>to recom|mend to them, &startq;the wonderful advantage and &s;trength their Party &s;hould gain by taking, and being united in this Covenant, and the de&s;perate condition they were like to be in without it: If the <HI>Scots</HI> came not to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, which, without this obligation, they could not do, they were in danger to be overwhelm'd by the Enemy; <MILESTONE N="40"> or at lea&s;t to make a di&s;advantageous and di&s;honourable Peace with them; which yet they could not tell how it would be ob&s;erv'd and kept. On the other hand, by this famous acce&s;&s;ion of &s;trength of a whole Nation, they &s;hould undoubtedly be able to ma&s;ter the War, and to make tho&s;e who had been the Cau&s;ers of it, defray the Charge; and &s;o all the Publick debts being di&s;charged out of the E&s;tates of De|linquents and Malignants, the Kingdom would not be at all impo|veri&s;hed, and the Peace, which &s;hould hereafter be made with the King, would be &s;ure to be inviolably ob&s;erv'd by the &s;trength of this Union; and therefore that it could not be purcha&s;ed at too dear a&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> rate.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;&endq; IT was, they &s;aid,</Q> <Q>&startq;neither Covetou&s;ne&s;s, nor want of Affection, and Zeal to their Relief, that the <HI>Scots,</HI> who took Their Cau&s;e to
<PB N="291" REF="3380">
heart as their own, de&s;ired an Advance of Money before they drew their Army into <HI>England,</HI> but pure Nece&s;&s;ity, and the Poverty of that Kingdom, already exhau&s;ted by their late expeditions, and keeping their Soldiers together for the good of This. And if there had been Money enough in that Country to have been procured upon the publick Stock and Revenue, or the Mortgage of private E&s;tates, to which all Men were forward for the Publick Good, their Love to their Brethren here was &s;uch, that they would neither have asked, nor re|ceiv'd Money for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, after it had proved effectual; much le&s;s, before the yeilding it. For Evidence of which frank and Bro|therly <MILESTONE N="10"> Inclination, they freely offer'd the Engagement of their own&endq; E&s;tates, for the repayment of the Money that &s;hould be advanced:</Q> which was the fir&s;t time, that ever Land in <HI>Scotland</HI> had been offer'd for &s;ecurity of Money, borrowed in the City of <HI>London.</HI> In the end, they very devoutly extolled the Covenant, magnified the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Na|tion, with all imaginable Attributes of E&s;teem and Reverence, <Q>&startq;a Na|tion that had engaged it &s;elf to God in a higher way, in a more extra|ordinary way, than any Nation this day upon the face of the Earth had done; a Nation, that had reform'd their lives fo$ &s;o &s;mall a time, more than ever any People, that they knew of, in the world had done; <MILESTONE N="20"> a Nation, that God had honour'd by giving as glorious Succe&s;s unto,&endq; as ever he did unto any:</Q> and very earne&s;tly de&s;ired the Loan of a hun|dred thou&s;and Pounds. The Rhetorick and the Zeal prevailed; a hundred thou&s;and pounds was promi&s;ed, and &s;hortly provided, and &s;ent to <HI>Edenborough;</HI> and the A&s;&s;urance of the <HI>Scots</HI> coming &s;o full, that they were looked upon as Ma&s;ters of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> allready. With &s;uch an alacrity all the&s;e things were tran&s;acted.</P>
<P>THAT Violent Party in the Parliament, which never intended any Peace with the King, and had more de&s;perate Mutations in their pur|po&s;es, than they avow'd, even among&s;t tho&s;e who concurr'd with them <MILESTONE N="30"> in all they de&s;ired, did not think them&s;elves &s;ecure in the Affection of the People, nor in tho&s;e who had the greate&s;t Tru&s;t in their Affairs. They had &s;een the great changes in the Hou&s;es, in the City, and in the Country, upon their late ill Succe&s;&s;es, the Defeat of <HI>Waller,</HI> and the lo&s;s of <HI>Bri&s;tol:</HI> and though the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;till adhered to them, yet they &s;aw he was not plea&s;ed, nor favoured one of tho&s;e Men upon whom they mo&s;t depended; but, on the contrary, all who were countenanced by Him, or in His confidence, were Men of &s;uch Principles as they liked not, or who de&s;ired no other Alterations, in the Court or Go|vernment, but only of the Per&s;ons who acted in it: therefore they had <MILESTONE N="40"> taken an opportunity, in the greate&s;t dejection of Spirit, and when they looked upon them&s;elves as near &s;wallow'd up by the King's power, <Q>to move &startq;that they might &s;end into <HI>Scotland</HI> to their Brethren there, to joyn with them, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them with an Army, that they might, by &s;uch a Conjunction, have a Support, to make them &s;o con&s;iderable, as to be treated with, and to receive conditions which might pre&s;erve&endq; them from ruin:</Q> which Propo&s;ition, being for &s;o common an Intere&s;t and Benefit, had receiv'd a General concurrence; and &s;o that Committee of both Hou&s;es had been &s;ent into <HI>Scotland,</HI> <Q>to put them in mind &startq;of their joynt concernment, and how impo&s;&s;ible it would be, for the <HI>Scots</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> long to enjoy the great conce&s;&s;ions they had obtain'd from the King, when the Parliament of <HI>England,</HI> by who&s;e Friend&s;hip, Power, and Authority they had obtain'd them, &s;hould be oppre&s;&s;ed, and forced to
<PB N="292" REF="3390">
yeild to &s;uch conditions for their particular pre&s;ervations, as the King&endq; would think fit to give them.</Q> But they were not a little &s;tartled, when they found this Me&s;&s;age had obliged them to a pre&s;ent expence of a hundred thou&s;and pounds, before there was any vi&s;ible Relief given them; and &s;aw them&s;elves involv'd in new obligations of Guilt, and to purpo&s;es they really never intended.</P>
<P>THERE hath been &s;carce any thing more wonderful throughout the Progre&s;s of the&s;e di&s;tractions, than that this Covenant did with &s;uch ex|traordinary expedition, pa&s;s the two Hou&s;es, when all the leading Per|&s;ons in tho&s;e Councils, were at the &s;ame time known to be as great Ene|mies <MILESTONE N="10"> to Presbytery (the E&s;tabli&s;hment whereof was the main end of this Covenant) as they were to the King or the Church. And He who con|tributed mo&s;t to it, and, in truth, was the Principal Contriver of it, and the Man by whom the Committee in <HI>Scotland</HI> was entirely, and &s;tupidly govern'd, S^r <HI>Harry Vane</HI> the younger, was not afterwards more known to abhor the Covenant, and the Presbyterians, than he was at that very time known to do, and laughed at 'em then, as much as ever he did afterwards.</P>
<P>HE was indeed a Man of extraordinary Parts, a plea&s;ant Wit, a great Under&s;tanding, which pierced into, and di&s;cern'd the purpo&s;es of other <MILESTONE N="20"> Men with wonderful Sagacity, whil&s;t he had Him&s;elf <HI>vultum clau&s;um,</HI> that no Man could make a gue&s;s of what he intended. He was of a tem|per not to be moved, and of rare di&s;&s;imulation, and could comply when it was not &s;ea&s;onable to contradict, without lo&s;ing ground by the con|de&s;cen&s;ion; and if he were not &s;uperior to M^r <HI>Hambden,</HI> he was inferior to no other Man, in all my&s;terious Artifices. There need no more be &s;aid of his Ability, than that he was cho&s;en to cozen, and deceive a whole Nation which was thought to excell in craft and cunning: which he did with notable pregnancy and dexterity, and prevailed with a Peo|ple, that could not otherwi&s;e be prevailed upon than by advancing <MILESTONE N="30"> their Idol Presbytery, to &s;acrifice their Peace, their Intere&s;t, and their Faith, to the erecting a Power and Authority that re&s;olv'd to per&s;ecute Presbytery to an extirpation; and, in proce&s;s of time, very near brought their purpo&s;e to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>THE Nation of <HI>Scotland,</HI> in general, had been &s;o fully &s;atisfied in all that they could pretend to de&s;ire, that they were very well di&s;po&s;ed to be Spectators of what was done in <HI>England,</HI> without engaging them|&s;elves in the Quarrel; and though there were &s;ome powerful Men among&s;t them, who&s;e guilt would not &s;uffer them to believe that they could be otherwi&s;e &s;ecure, than by the King's want of power to call <MILESTONE N="40"> them to ju&s;tice, yet their Number was not thought &s;o great, as to be able to corrupt the People into a bare-faced Act of Rebellion: nor had they any &s;uch face of Authority, as to invite them to it. Without a Parliament, they could not propo&s;e it; the King had ab&s;olutely refu&s;ed to call a Parliament, and it was yet above a Year to come, before a Par|liament could be A&s;&s;embled without the King's Con&s;ent; and in that time, the King might have the better of his Enemies. However, the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Parliament had not been long at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> before they prevailed with the Council to call a Parliament; which Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and others, who pretended great devotion to the King, <MILESTONE N="50"> and were of the Council, had promi&s;ed the King to oppo&s;e, <Q>and &s;aid &startq;&endq; they were powerful enough to prevent it.</Q> When it came to the point, Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> being, one way or other, per&s;waded him&s;elf, per&s;waded
<PB N="293" REF="3400">
others, <Q>&startq;that the ab&s;olute refu&s;al to &s;uffer a Parliament to be called, would not quiet the Debate, nor &s;ecure the King, but more enflame tho&s;e who de&s;ired it; who would take &s;ome other time, when many of them who oppo&s;ed it &s;hould be ab&s;ent, to propo&s;e it; and &s;o would carry it: and that therefore they were better be ab&s;ent at fir&s;t, where|by the others, might, without oppo&s;ition, &s;end out their Summons for a Parliament to A&s;&s;emble, at the day they thought fit; and that, as they who would &s;erve the King would not be there, &s;o they &s;hould prevail with as many others as they could, not to be there likewi&s;e; whereby the number which appear'd, would be &s;o incon&s;iderable, that <MILESTONE N="10"> they would not dare to &s;it, but perfectly di&s;per&s;e; and this di&s;appoint|ment would for ever qua&s;h that de&s;ign, and render tho&s;e who advi&s;ed it, odious to the People; as Men who de&s;ired illegally to engage the&endq; Nation in unju&s;tifiable ways, to di&s;turb the publick Peace.</Q></P>
<P>A SUMMONS was accordingly &s;ent out to call a Parliament, to meet <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Parliament Summon'd by the Cove|nanters in</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> at a day appointed; before which time, tho&s;e of the Nobility and Gen|try, who did really de&s;ire to &s;erve the King, applied them&s;elves to Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> (who&s;e advice and orders, the King him&s;elf had required them to ob&s;erve; unhappily &s;till believing him to be faithf$l) to know what they &s;hould do: <Q>many of the principal of them declaring their opinions <MILESTONE N="20"> to him, &startq;that they &s;hould take an opportunity to meet together, and bring their Friends with them, whereby they might make a good Body of Hor&s;e, and &s;o, with their Armes in their hands, they would de|clare&endq; again&s;t the Legality of that Parliament,</Q> and the meeting in it: and named a fit opportunity to him for &s;uch a meeting at the Funeral of a Lady, which was to be within &s;ome days, when, according to the cu&s;tom of that People, great Numbers of Per&s;ons of Quality u&s;e to A&s;|&s;emble, to do Honour to the dead in the la&s;t ob&s;equies. <Q>He told them, &startq;he believ'd, it mu&s;t come &s;hortly to that remedy, but conceiv'd it not yet time, and that &s;uch a meeting would frighten the People, and en|crea&s;e <MILESTONE N="30"> the Number in Parliament, and make many re&s;ort to them for&endq; their directions.</Q> <Q>He likewi&s;e &s;aid, &startq;he had changed his former opi|nion, concerning their own being ab&s;ent at that time of the meeting of the Parliament, &s;ince their meer ab&s;ence would not be di&s;counte|nance enough, and that they who &s;at, would carry the Reputation of a Parliament, and the People would be guided by them, if there were nothing but their ab&s;ence to work upon their inclinations, and af|fections.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE propo&s;ed therefore to them, &startq;that they would all re&s;olve to be pre&s;ent, and take their places; and that, when the Hou&s;e &s;hould be <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;at, and any Man &s;hould &s;tand up to propo&s;e the taking any bu&s;ine&s;s into con&s;ideration, He [the Duke] would fir&s;t make his Prote&s;tation again&s;t proceeding in &s;o illegal a Convention, and then They &s;hould all make the &s;ame Prote&s;tation; and he did hope, that the Number of the Prote&s;ters would be great enough to di&s;&s;olve the meeting; and thus they &s;hould put the be&s;t end to the matter that could de de&s;ired: but if it &s;hould &s;ucceed otherwi&s;e, then would be the time to with|draw and put them&s;elves in Armes; towards which he would make&endq; the be&s;t preparation he could; and de&s;ired Them to do the like.</Q> The Earl of <HI>Kinoul,</HI> and &s;ome others, made exception again&s;t this Expedient, <MILESTONE N="50"> and pre&s;&s;ed the former meeting at the Funeral, till the Duke told them, <Q>&startq;&endq; the King liked the other way better;</Q> and pulled a Letter out of his Pocket, which he had receiv'd from his Maje&s;ty, and read them &s;o much

<P>THE Parliament met at the day; and Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> according to his promi&s;e, took an opportunity to &s;ay &s;omewhat that &s;eem'd to imply a Prote&s;tation again&s;t the meeting; upon which, many of the Lords, who had been allways mo&s;t engaged again&s;t the King, were very warm; <Q>and demanded, &startq;that he &s;hould declare him&s;elf clearly, whether he did&endq; Prote&s;t again&s;t the Parliament;</Q> whereupon his Brother the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> who was Secretary of State to the King, &s;tood up, <Q>and &s;aid, <MILESTONE N="10"> &startq;that he hoped, that Noble Lord's Affection to his Country was better known, than that any Man could imagine he would Prote&s;t again&s;t the&endq; Parliament of the Kingdom;</Q> and then the Duke explain'd, and excu&s;ed him&s;elf; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;he meant no &s;uch thing:&endq;</Q> and &s;o they declared, <Q>&startq;that they would Treat with the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who were &s;ent from the&endq; Parliament of <HI>England;</HI> and appointed Commi&s;&s;ioners for that purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P>SOME are of opinion, that, even at this time, they did not intend to engage in the War again&s;t the King; but that, as a few Men cozen'd the Parliament at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> <Q>by per&s;wading them, &startq;that they de&s;ired&endq; only a &s;afe Peace,</Q> till, by multiplication of Indignities, they made it <MILESTONE N="20"> impo&s;&s;ible to make a Peace that would appear &s;afe; &s;o there was as &s;mall a Number in <HI>Scotland,</HI> that overreached the Parliament there, <Q>by per|&s;wading, &startq;that they never intended to do any thing again&s;t the King, but that it would be too ingrateful a thing, and render them very odious to the whole <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, if, after they had receiv'd &s;o many obligations from the Parliament there, to who&s;e protection they owed their Religion, and all that they enjoyed, they &s;hould refu&s;e &s;o much as to Treat with them, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, by their interpo&s;ition, to procure a good Peace for them with the King; which would be a great Honour to them; and would be as great an obligation to his Maje&s;ty,&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> as to the Parliament.</Q> That this was all that was in their thoughts; and that they would avoid any Engagement in a War, not by rejecting the Propo&s;ition, but by making &s;uch demands, as they knew well, would never be accepted by the Parliament at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> <Q>Thereupon they told the Commi&s;&s;ioners from that Parliament, &startq;that it would be im|po&s;&s;ible to engage their Nation in a joynt concurrence with them, again&s;t the King, but by the Influence and Authority of their Kirk; and that it would be as impo&s;&s;ible to procure the Con&s;ent of their Kirk, except by making it evident to them, that the Government of the Church in <HI>England,</HI> &s;hould be reduced to the &s;ame model with <MILESTONE N="40"> Theirs in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and that Epi&s;copacy &s;hould be totally extirpated; and that Deans and Chapters, &s;hould be utterly aboli&s;hed; without&endq; which,</Q> <Q>they &s;aid, &startq;they could never think their own Government &s;ecurely e&s;tabli&s;hed; but if &s;uch a promi&s;e might be &s;olemnly made, their Kirk would be throughly engaged, and the Nation, to a Man,&endq; would enter into the Quarrel.</Q></P>
<P>S^r <HI>Harry Vane</HI> was not &s;urpri&s;ed with the Propo&s;ition, which he had long fore&s;een, and came re&s;olv'd to pay their own price for their Friend|&s;hip. Thereupon, as hath been allready &s;aid, the Covenant was prepared, and other Propo&s;itions made for the pre&s;ent furni&s;hing a great Sum of <MILESTONE N="50"> Money, to enable them to begin their Levies; and many other extra|vagant Conditions propo&s;ed on the <HI>Scots</HI> part, for the payment of the Army, and other va&s;t expences, that they did not believe the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners
<PB N="295" REF="3420">
would yeild, or that the Parliament would perform, if they were yeilded unto. Nothing of Money, or Honour, made any delay; and they came provided with &s;ome Letters of Credit, that as little time might be lo&s;t as was po&s;&s;ible, in making all nece&s;&s;ary preparations. The Covenant was the matter of Difficulty; they knowing well, that many of their greate&s;t Friends, both in the Parliament, and the Army, had not any mind to change the Government of the Church; to which the People of <HI>England</HI> were not generally di&s;affected.</P>
<P>S^r <HI>Harry Vane</HI> therefore (who equally hated Epi&s;copacy and Presby|tery, &s;ave that he wi&s;hed the one Aboli&s;hed with much impatience, be|lieving <MILESTONE N="10"> it much ea&s;ier to keep the other from being E&s;tabli&s;hed, what|ever they promi&s;ed, than to be rid of that which was &s;ettled in the King|dom) carefully con&s;ider'd the Covenant, and after he had alter'd, and changed many expre&s;&s;ions in it, and made them doubtful enough to bear many interpretations, he, and his fellow Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;ign'd the whole Treaty; <Q>whereby it was provided, &startq;that the Covenant &s;hould be taken throughout all his Maje&s;ties Dominions; that a Committee of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sub&s;tance of the Treaty between the</HI> Engli&s;h <HI>Com|mi&s;&s;ioners and the</HI> Scots.</NOTE> the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould allways &s;it with the Clo&s;e Committee at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> for the carrying on of the War, with equal Autho$$ty; that there &s;hould be no Treaty of Peace with the King, without the joynt con|&s;ent&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> of the Parliaments of both Kingdoms;</Q> and many other particu|lars, very derogatory to the Honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; and with all po&s;&s;ible expedition &s;ent it to the Clo&s;e Committee at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> in the time of their con&s;ternation, and before the relief of <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> which tran&s;mitted it pre&s;ently back to them, allow'd and confirm'd.</P>
<P>AND thereupon the Parliament at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> re&s;olv'd to rai&s;e a great Army, and to invade <HI>England;</HI> and their old General <HI>Le&s;ley,</HI> who had &s;o &s;olemnly promi&s;ed the King, <Q>not only &startq;never to bear Armes&endq; <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scots <HI>rai&s;e an Army under</HI> Le&s;ley.</NOTE> again&s;t him,</Q> but to Serve him, let the Cau&s;e be what it would, with|out any he&s;itation undertook the Command of it. All this time, Duke <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Hamilton</HI> looked on, and &s;ometimes &s;ate with them; and when the fir&s;t Proclamation was prepared, in the King's name, for a General Ren|dezvous of all Men, from &s;uch an Age to &s;uch an Age, at &s;uch a time and place, that &s;o their Army might be pre&s;ently form'd, the Earl of <HI>Lanrick</HI> put the King's Signet, with the keeping whereof he was tru&s;ted, to the &s;aid Proclamation: and all this being done, both the Brothers left <HI>Scotland,</HI> to give the King an Account at <HI>Oxford,</HI> of all the Pro|ceedings: Many of the Nobility of that Kingdom, who did heartily wi&s;h well to the King, being gone from thence, after the fir&s;t days meet|ing of their Parliament (when the Duke had broken his promi&s;e to them) and inform'd his Maje&s;ty at large of that which They thought foul In|fidelity.</P>
<P>THE Di&s;compo&s;ures, Jealou&s;ies, and Di&s;gu&s;ts, which reigned at <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Divi&s;ions a|mongst the Councils at</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> produced great Inconveniences; and as, many times, Men in a Scuffle lo&s;e their Weapons, and light upon tho&s;e which belonged to their Adver&s;aries, who again Arme them&s;elves with tho&s;e which be|longed to the others, &s;uch, one would have thought, had been the For|tune of the King's Army in the Encounters with the Enemies: for tho&s;e under the King's Commanders grew in&s;en&s;ibly into all the Licence, Di&s;|order, and Impiety, with which they had reproached the Rebels; and They, into great Di&s;cipline, Diligence and Sobriety; which begot Cou|rage and Re&s;olution in them, and notable dexterity in Atchievements and Enterpri&s;es. In&s;omuch, as one &s;ide &s;eem'd to Fight for Monarchy,
<PB N="296" REF="3430">
with the Weapons of Confu&s;ion, and the other to de&s;troy the King and Government, with all the Principles and Regularity of Monarchy.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of the Troubles, the King had very prudently re|&s;olv'd with him&s;elf, to confer no Honours, or be&s;tow any Offices or Pre|ferments upon any, till the end and conclu&s;ion of the Service; and if that Re&s;olution had continued, He would have found much ea&s;e by it, and his Service great Advantage. The Nece&s;&s;ity and Exigents of the War, &s;hortly after made &s;ome breach into this &s;ea&s;onable re&s;olution, and, for ready Money to carry on the War, his Maje&s;ty was compelled, again&s;t his Nature, to di&s;pence &s;ome favours, which he would not willing|ly <MILESTONE N="10"> have &s;uffer'd to be purcha&s;ed, but by Vertue and high Merit. Then all Men thought Money and Money worth to be all one; and that who|&s;oever, by his Service, had de&s;erved a Reward of Money, had de&s;erved any thing that might be had for Money. And when it was apparent, that the War was like to prove a bu&s;ine&s;s of time, it was thought un|rea&s;onable, that the King &s;hould not confer rewards on Some, which he was able to do, becau&s;e he could not do it on All, which was con|fe&s;&s;edly out of his power. And &s;o, by importunity, and upon the Title of old Promi&s;es, and &s;ome conveniences of his Service, he be&s;tow'd Ho|nours upon &s;ome principal Officers of his Army, and Offices upon others; <MILESTONE N="20"> to which, though, in the particulars, no ju&s;t exceptions could be taken, yet many were Angry to &s;ee &s;ome preferr'd, and not &s;o much extolling their own merit and &s;ervice, as making it equal to tho&s;e whom they &s;aw advanced, every Man thought him&s;elf neglected and &s;lighted, in that another was better e&s;teem'd.</P>
<P>AND this Poy&s;on of Envy wrought upon many Natures, which had skill enough not to confe&s;s it: The Soldiers, albeit they were emulous among&s;t them&s;elves, and very un&s;atisfied with one another (there being unhappy Animo&s;ities among&s;t the Principal Officers) yet they were too well united, and reconciled again&s;t any other Body of Men; and think|ing <MILESTONE N="$0"> the King's Crown depended wholely on the fortune of Their Swords, believ'd no other Per&s;ons to be con&s;iderable, and no Councils fit to be con&s;ulted with, but the Martial; and thence proceeded a fatal di&s;re&s;pect and irreverence to the Council of State, to which, by the whole&s;ome Con&s;titution of the Kingdom, the Militia, Garri&s;ons, and all Martial power is purely, and naturally Subordinate; and by the Authority, and prudence whereof, Provi&s;ion could be only rea&s;onably expected, for the countenance and &s;upport of the Army.</P>
<P>THE General, and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> were both Strangers to the Go|vernment and Cu&s;tom of the Kingdom, and utterly unacquainted with <MILESTONE N="$0"> the Nobility, and the King's Mini&s;ters, or with their Rights: and the Prince's heart was &s;o wholely &s;et upon Actions of War, that he not only neglected, but too much contemn'd the peaceable and civil Arts, which were mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary even to the carrying on of the other. And certainly, &s;omewhat like that which <HI>Plutarch</HI> &s;ays of the Roman Au|guries, <Q>&startq;that <HI>Octavius</HI> lo&s;t his Life by tru&s;ting to them, and that <HI>Ma|rius&endq;</HI> pro&s;per'd the better,</Q> becau&s;e he did not altogether de&s;pi&s;e them, may be &s;aid of Popularity: though he that too immoderately, and im|portunately affects it (which was the ca&s;e of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex)</HI> will hardly continue innocent; yet he who too affectedly de&s;pi&s;es, or neglects what <MILESTONE N="$0"> is &s;aid of him, or what is generally thought of Per&s;ons, or Things, and too Stoically contemns the Affections of Men, even of Vulgar (be his other Abilities and Virtues as great as can be imagined) will, in &s;ome
<PB N="297" REF="3440">
conjuncture of time, find him&s;elf very unfortunate. And it may be, a better rea&s;on cannot be a&s;&s;ign'd for the misfortunes that hopeful young Prince (who had great parts of mind, as well as Vigour of Body, and an incomparable per&s;onal Courage) underwent, and the Kingdom thereby, than that unpoli&s;hed roughne&s;s of his Nature; which render'd him le&s;s patient to hear, and con&s;equently le&s;s skilful to judge of tho&s;e things, which &s;hould have guided him in the di&s;charge of his important Tru&s;t: and making an unskilful judgement of the unu&s;efulne&s;s of the Councils, by his ob&s;ervation of the infirmities and weakne&s;s of &s;ome particular Coun&s;ellors, he grew to a full di&s;e&s;teem of the Acts of that Board; <MILESTONE N="10"> which mu&s;t ever be re&s;pected, as long as the Regal Power is exerci&s;ed in <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P>I CANNOT but, on this occa&s;ion, continue this digre&s;&s;ion thus much farther, to ob&s;erve, that they who avoid publick Debates in Council, or think them of no moment, upon undervaluing the Per&s;ons of &s;ome Coun&s;ellors, and from the particular infirmities of the Men, the heavi|ne&s;s of this Man, the Levity of another, the weakne&s;s and &s;implicity of a third, conclude, that the advice and opinions of Many are not re|qui&s;ite to any great de&s;ign, are exceedingly deceiv'd; and will perni|ciou&s;ly deceive others who are mi&s;led by tho&s;e conclu&s;ions. For it is in <MILESTONE N="20"> Wi&s;dom, as it is in Beauty, a face that, being taken in pieces, affords &s;carce one exact feature, an eye, or a no&s;e, or a tooth, or a brow, or a mouth, again&s;t which a vi&s;ible ju&s;t exception may not be taken, yet al|together, by a gracefulne&s;s and vivacity in the whole, may con&s;titute an excellent Beauty, and be more charming than another, who&s;e Sym|metry is more faultle&s;s; &s;o there are many Men, who in one particular Argument, may be unskilful, in another affected, who may &s;eem to have &s;ome Levity, and Vanity, or Formality, in ordinary and cur&s;ory Conver&s;ation (a very crooked Rule to mea&s;ure any Man's Abilities, as giving a better Mea&s;ure of the Humour, than of the Under&s;tanding) <MILESTONE N="$0"> and yet in form'd Coun&s;els, Deliberations, and Tran&s;actions, are Men of great In&s;ight, and Wi&s;dom, and from whom excellent A&s;&s;i&s;tance may be contributed.</P>
<P>NO Que&s;tion, all great Enterpri&s;es, and De&s;igns, that are to be executed, have many parts, even in the projection, fit for the Survey and Di&s;qui&s;ition of &s;everal Faculties and Abilities, equally for the deci|&s;ion of &s;harper, and more phlegmatick Under&s;tandings. And We often hear, in Debates of great Moment, Animadver&s;ions of more weight, and con&s;equence, from tho&s;e who&s;e ordinary conver&s;ation may not be &s;o delightful, than from Men of more &s;ublime parts. Certainly <HI>Solomon</HI> well under&s;tood him&s;elf, when he &s;aid, <HI>In the Multitude of Coun&s;ellors there is &s;afety.</HI> And though it be confe&s;s'd, that rea&s;on would be bet|ter di&s;cover'd, and &s;tated, and right conclu&s;ions ea&s;ier made by a few, than by a greater Number, yet when the Execution depends on many and the general interpretation &s;o much depends on the Succe&s;s, and the Succe&s;s on the Interpretation, We &s;ee tho&s;e Coun&s;els u&s;ually mo&s;t pro|&s;perous, whereof the con&s;iderations, and deliberations, have been mea|&s;ured by that Standard which is mo&s;t publickly acknowledged, and re|ceiv'd. He has had but &s;mall Experience in the managing Affairs, who is not able experimentally to name to him&s;elf, &s;ome very good and u&s;e|ful conclu&s;ions, which have therefore only mi&s;carried, becau&s;e they were not communicated to tho&s;e, who thought they had rea&s;on to be|$lieve them&s;elves competent parties to the Secret. There was &s;eldom ever
<PB N="298" REF="3450">
yet that publick heartedne&s;s &s;unk into the brea&s;ts of Men, as to be long willing to be left out in tho&s;e tran&s;actions, to the privacy whereof they had a right. And therefore Men have been often willing enough, any &s;ingle Advice &s;hould mi&s;carry, of what&s;oever general Concernment, rather than contribute to the fame of &s;ome One Man, who has thought Their Approbation not worth the providing for. And though the Ad|vantage of &s;ecrecy and di&s;patch, &s;eems to favour a &s;mall Number of Coun&s;ellors, yet (except in &s;ome few ca&s;es, which in their own Nature are to be both con&s;ulted, and acted together, and the full Execution whereof may be by a few) I am not &s;ure that the inconveniency will <MILESTONE N="10"> be greater by the nece&s;&s;ary delays, occa&s;ion'd by the Number, or even by &s;uch a di&s;covery, as may be &s;uppo&s;ed to proceed from the Levity of any of them, than by wanting the Approbation, and Concurrence of tho&s;e, who will unavoidably know it &s;oon enough to add to, or take from the Succe&s;s, at lea&s;t the Reputation, of any publick bu&s;ine&s;s. Much of the Negligence, and Di&s;re&s;pect towards the Civil Councils, proceeded from the&s;e unhappy Cau&s;es. For as all Corporations, Tribes, and Fra|ternities, &s;uffer mo&s;t by the malignity of &s;ome of their own Members; &s;o the Jealou&s;y, and Indi&s;po&s;ition of &s;ome Coun&s;ellors, contributed much to the di&s;regard which fell upon the Order; and in Them, upon the <MILESTONE N="20"> King.</P>
<P>AMONG tho&s;e who were next the King's Tru&s;t, and to whom he com|municated the greate&s;t Secrets in his Affairs, there were &s;ome, who from private, though very good, conditions of life, without &s;uch an appli|cation to Court as u&s;ually u&s;hered in tho&s;e promotions, were a&s;cended to that preferment; and were believ'd to have an equal Intere&s;t with any, in their Ma&s;ters e&s;timation. The&s;e were &s;ure to find no more Cha|rity from the Court, than from the Army; and they having had lately &s;o many equals, it was thought no pre&s;umption, freely to cen&s;ure all they did, or &s;poke; what effect &s;oever &s;uch freedom had upon the publick <MILESTONE N="30"> Policy and Tran&s;actions. It were to be wi&s;h'd, that Per&s;ons of the greate&s;t Birth, Honour, and Fortune, would take that care of them&s;elves by Education, Indu&s;try, Literature, and a love of Virtue, to &s;urpa&s;s all other Men in Knowledge, and all other Qualifications, nece&s;&s;ary for great Actions, as far as they do in Quality and Titles; that Princes, out of Them, might allways choo&s;e Men fit for all Employments, and high Tru&s;ts; which would exceedingly advance their Service; when the re|putation and re&s;pect of the Per&s;on carries &s;omewhat with it, that faci|litates the bu&s;ine&s;s. And it cannot ea&s;ily be expre&s;&s;ed, nor comprehended by any who have not felt the weight, and burthen of the Envy, which <MILESTONE N="40"> naturally attends upon tho&s;e promotions, which &s;eem to be <HI>per Saltum,</HI> how great &s;treights and difficulties &s;uch Mini&s;ters are forced to wre&s;tle with, and by which the Charges, with which they are entru&s;ted, mu&s;t proportionably &s;uffer, let the Integrity and Wi&s;dom of the Men, be what it can be &s;uppo&s;ed to be. Neither is the patience, and dexterity, to carry a Man through tho&s;e &s;treights, ea&s;ily attained; it being very hard, in the morning of preferment, to keep an even temper of mind, between the care to pre&s;erve the dignity of the place committed to him (without which he &s;hall expo&s;e him&s;elf to a thou&s;and rude attempts, and di&s;honour the judgement that promoted him, by appearing too <MILESTONE N="50"> mean for &s;uch a Tru&s;t) and between the caution, that his Nature be not really exalted to an overweening pride and folly, upon the priviledge of his great place; which will expo&s;e him to much more contempt, than
<PB N="299" REF="3460">
the former; and therefore is, with a more exact Guard, to be avoided: the Errors of gentlene&s;s and civility, being much more ea&s;ily reform'd, as well as endured, than the other of arrogance and o&s;tentation.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t provi&s;ion that &s;uch Men can make for their Voyage, be|&s;ides a la&s;ting &s;tock of innocency, and a firm confidence in God Al|mighty, that he will never &s;uffer that innocency to be utterly oppre&s;&s;ed, or notoriou&s;ly defamed, is, an expectation of tho&s;e Gu&s;ts, and Storms of Rumour, Detraction, and Envy; and a re&s;olution not to be over &s;en|&s;ible of all Calumnies, Unkindne&s;s, or Inju&s;tice; but to believe, that, by being Preferr'd before other Men, they have an obligation upon them, <MILESTONE N="10"> to Suffer more than other Men would do; and that the be&s;t way to con|vince &s;candals, and mi&s;reports, is, by neglecting them, to appear not to have de&s;erv'd them. There is not a more trouble&s;ome pa&s;&s;ion, or that often draws more inconveniences with it, than that which proceeds from the indignation of being unju&s;tly calumniated, and from the pride of an upright Con&s;cience; when Men cannot endure to be &s;poken ill of, if they have not de&s;erv'd it: in which di&s;temper, though they &s;hould free them&s;elves from the Errors, or Infirmities, with which they were traduced, they commonly di&s;cover others, of which they had never been &s;u&s;pected. In a word, let no hone&s;t Man that is o$ce enter'd into <MILESTONE N="20"> this li&s;t, think, he can by any skill, or comportment, prevent the&s;e con|flicts and a&s;&s;aults; or that he can, by any &s;tubborn or impetuous hu|mour, &s;uppre&s;s, and prevail over them: but let him look upon it as Purgatory; he is unavoidably to pa&s;s through, and depend upon provi|dence, and time, for a vindication; and by con&s;tantly performing all the duties of his place, with Ju&s;tice, Integrity, and Uprightne&s;s, give all Men cau&s;e to believe, he was worthy of the fir&s;t Hour; which is a Triumph very Lawfully to be affected.</P>
<P>As the&s;e di&s;tempers, indi&s;po&s;itions, and infirmities of particular Men, had a great influence upon the publick Affairs, and di&s;turbed and <MILESTONE N="30"> weaken'd the whole frame and fabrick of the King's de&s;igns; &s;o no par|ticular Man was more di&s;quieted by them, than the King him&s;elf; who, in his Per&s;on, as well as in his Bu&s;ine&s;s, &s;uffer'd all the Vexation of the rude, petulant, and di&s;contented humours of Court, and Army. His Maje&s;ty now paid Intere&s;t for all the benefit and advantage, he had re|ceiv'd in the beginning of the War, by his gentlene&s;s, and Princely af|fability to all Men, and by de&s;cending &s;omewhat from the forms of Ma|je&s;ty, which he had, in his former life, ob&s;erv'd with all punctuality. He vouch&s;afed then him&s;elf to receive any Addre&s;&s;es, and Overtures for his Service, and to hold di&s;cour&s;e with all Men who brought devotion <MILESTONE N="40"> to him; and he mu&s;t be now troubled with the complaints, and mur|murs, and humours of all; and how frivolous, and unrea&s;onable &s;oever, the cau&s;e was, his Maje&s;ty was put both to inform, and temper their Under&s;tandings. No Man would receive an An&s;wer but from Him&s;elf, and expected a better from him, than he mu&s;t have been contented to have receiv'd from any Body el&s;e. Every Man magnified the Service he had done, and his Ability, and Intere&s;t to do greater, and propo&s;ed Ho|nour and Reward equal to both in his own &s;en&s;e. <Q>And if he receiv'd not an An&s;wer to his mind, he grew &s;ullen, complain'd, &startq;he was neg|lected,&endq; and re&s;olv'd,</Q> <Q>or pretended &s;o, &startq;to quit the Service, and to&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> Travel into &s;ome Forreign Kingdom.</Q> He is deceiv'd that believes the ordinary Carriage, and State of a King, to be matters of indifferency, and of no relation to his Greatne&s;s. They are the Outworks, which

pre&s;erve Maje&s;ty it &s;elf from approaches and &s;urpri&s;al. We find that the Queen of <HI>Sheba</HI> was amazed at the meat of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Table, and the &s;itting of his Servants, and the attendance of his Mini&s;ters, and their Apparel, and his Cup-bearers <HI>&amp;c.</HI> as &s;o great in&s;tances of <HI>Solomon</HI>'s Wi&s;dom, that <HI>there was no more &s;pirit in her.</HI> And no doubt, what Prince &s;oever incon&s;iderately departs from tho&s;e forms, and trappings, and ornaments of his dignity, and preeminence, will hardly, at &s;ome time, be able to pre&s;erve the body it &s;elf of Maje&s;ty, from intru&s;ion, inva&s;ion, and violation.</P>
<P>AND let no Man think, that the King had now no hard task to ma&s;ter <MILESTONE N="10"> the&s;e Troubles, and that a &s;hort and &s;harp bla&s;t of Royal Severity, would ea&s;ily have di&s;per&s;ed the&s;e clouds. The di&s;ea&s;e was too violent and catching, and the contagion too univer&s;al, to be cured by that re|medy; neither were the &s;ymptoms, or effects, the &s;ame in all con&s;titu|tions. It cannot be imagined, into how many &s;everal &s;hapes Mens in|di&s;po&s;itions were put, and how many Artifices were u&s;ed to get Honours, Offices, Preferments, and the waywardne&s;s and perver&s;ne&s;s, which at|tended the being di&s;appointed of their own hopes. One Man had been named for &s;uch a place, that is, Him&s;elf and his Friends had given it out, that he &s;hould have it, when, it may be, he was too mode&s;t to pretend <MILESTONE N="20"> to it; and upon this Vogue he had a Title, and if it &s;hould be conferr'd upon another, it would be a mark of the King's disfavour to him; and thereby he &s;hould lo&s;e the Ability, and Credit, without which he could do no farther Service. Another &s;ugge&s;ted, that his Friends and Com|panions in con&s;ort, had all receiv'd &s;ome obligation, and if he alone &s;hould remain without &s;ome te&s;timony of favour, it would be a brand upon him of &s;ome &s;ignal unworthine&s;s. No Man was &s;o hard hearted to him&s;elf, as not to be able to give a rea&s;on for any thing he de&s;ired; and He commonly had be&s;t &s;ucce&s;s, who pro&s;ecuted his own wi&s;hes with mo&s;t boldne&s;s, and importunity; neither was there a better, or <MILESTONE N="30"> another rea&s;on for &s;ome Men's Preferment, than that they had &s;et their hearts upon it, and Would have it. And it was a great temptation to mode&s;t Natures, to find forward Men had &s;o good Fortune, that the want of Succe&s;s begun to be imputed to want of Wit.</P>
<P><Q>I REMEMBER about this time, a Per&s;on of good Quality, and of a good Name in Action, came to me very pen&s;ive, and told me, &startq;how con&s;cienciou&s;ly he had &s;erv'd the King, without any private de&s;igns, or other thoughts, than the di&s;charge of his own Duty, and rendring the performance of that Duty acceptable to his Maje&s;ty; yet that, to his un&s;peakable di&s;comfort, he found, he had been mi&s;repre&s;ented <MILESTONE N="40"> to the King, and that his Maje&s;ty had entertained a &s;ini&s;ter opinion of him, and de&s;ired me to learn, what the ground of the prejudice&endq; was, and by my good te&s;timony to endeavour to remove it.</Q> I had a very good opinion of the Per&s;on, and believ'd the King had &s;o, and therefore per&s;waded him, that the Jealou&s;y was groundle&s;s, and pre&s;&s;ed to know, from whence he receiv'd tho&s;e impre&s;&s;ions; <Q>he excu&s;ed him|&s;elf in the particular, and a&s;&s;ured me, &startq;that he had his Adverti&s;ement from a &s;ure hand, which was to be concealed and not doubted; that, upon my Enquiry, I would find it true, though he could not imagine&endq; the cau&s;e.</Q> <Q>I promi&s;ed him, &startq;I would pre&s;s the King very heartily in <MILESTONE N="50"> it, and if there were any thing that &s;tuck with him, I pre&s;umed his&endq; Maje&s;ty would be &s;o gracious to let me know it;</Q> and accordingly, having &s;hortly after an opportunity to wait on his Maje&s;ty, I told him
<PB N="301" REF="3480">
the true Narrative of what had pa&s;&s;ed, with my ob&s;ervation of the ge|neral comportment of that Gentleman, and be&s;ought his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;if any ill Offices had been done him, or that any prejudice towards him was lodged in his Royal brea&s;t, that he would graciou&s;ly vouch&s;afe to tell me what it was, and that he would allow him an Acce&s;s, to clear him&s;elf from any imputations. The King very chearfully a&s;&s;ured me, that he had not only a very good opinion of that Gentleman, but that&endq; he was mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured, he had no real &s;u&s;picion to the contrary;</Q> and therefore, <Q>bid me &startq;proceed to the other part of my bu&s;ine&s;s. I told him, I had no more, and that I was &s;ure, I &s;hould make a very happy Man&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> by &s;atisfying him of what I found.</Q> <Q>Then, &s;aid the King, &startq;you are not throughly in&s;tructed, for the other half of this bu&s;ine&s;s mu&s;t be a&endq; Sute.</Q> <Q>I replied, &startq;if that were &s;o, I was yet more ignorant than I&endq; &s;u&s;pected my &s;elf.</Q> The Gentleman &s;hortly after came to me, in pain, as I thought, with the jealou&s;y of being in Umbrage; and when I gave him pregnant A&s;&s;urance to the contrary, with the mention of &s;ome Ex|pre&s;&s;ions the King had u&s;ed, which were indeed very gracious, he &s;eem'd to receive it with &s;uch a countenance and gu&s;to, that I verily believ'd he had had his hearts de&s;ire. <Q>But, the next morning, he came to me again, and told me, &startq;that I had made him abundantly $$ppy; and that <MILESTONE N="20"> he doubted not, there was no ju&s;t ground for the other reports, but only the Malice of tho&s;e who wi&s;hed them true; yet, that they had le&s;&s;en'd his credit abroad, even with his Friends, and that he found, there was no way to keep up his Reputation, and Intere&s;t in the world, whereby he might be able to do the King Service (which was all he looked after) but the receiving &s;ome te&s;timony of the King's good opi|nion, which would be a publick evidence that the other di&s;cour&s;es were&endq; fal&s;e.</Q> I was &s;urpri&s;ed, and as much out of countenance, as He &s;hould have been; <Q>and advi&s;ed him &startq;to patience, and to expect the King's own time, and method, rather than to quicken him by any importunity,&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> which would give an ill reli&s;h to any obligation.</Q> He would not un|der&s;tand that Philo&s;ophy, but &s;hortly after found &s;ome other means, to pre&s;s the King very roundly for a place, upon the title of that good opinion he had declared to me to hold of him; <Q>not without &s;ome impli|cation, &startq;that, without &s;ome &s;uch earne&s;t of his Maje&s;ties goodne&s;s, he&endq; &s;hould not be able to continue in his Service;</Q> which probably was one of the mode&s;te&s;t Addre&s;&s;es, which were made to him at that time. And it cannot be denied, this way the King's Trouble was &s;o great, that he many times &s;uffer'd more Vexation from the indi&s;po&s;ition, and humours of his own People, than from the Enemy, or the apprehen&s;ion of their <MILESTONE N="40"> Coun&s;els: which hath made me enlarge this digre&s;&s;ion &s;o much; con|ceiving it no le&s;s to be a part of Hi&s;tory, and more u&s;eful to Po&s;terity, to leave a Character of the times, than of the Per&s;ons, or the Narra|tive of the matters of Fact, which cannot be &s;o well under&s;tood, as by knowing the Genius that prevailed when they were tran&s;acted.</P>
<P>THE be&s;t Expedient his Maje&s;ty could find to di&s;pel the&s;e fumes, was Motion and Action; and therefore, though the Sea&s;on of the Year was too far &s;pent, and too many Officers hurt, for the taking the Field again, be&s;ides that many Regiments were return'd to their old Po&s;ts (as the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> to defend their own Country from the Incur&s;ions from <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> and to reduce &s;ome Towns in <HI>Pembroke-&s;hire,</HI> which, lying on the Sea, by the help of the Parliament Ships, begun to fortify, and gather &s;trength) yet he re&s;olv'd his Forces about <HI>Oxford</HI> &s;hould not lie &s;till.</P>
<P><PB N="302" REF="3490">
IN the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> with a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e, Foot, and Dragoons, marched into <HI>Bedford-&s;hire,</HI> and took the Town of <HI>Bedford,</HI> and in it a Party of the Enemy, who u&s;ed it only as a &s;trong Quarter. This expedition was principally to countenance S^r <HI>Lewis Dives,</HI> whil&s;t he Fortified <HI>Newport Pannel,</HI> where he hoped to fix a Garri&s;on; which would have made a more direct line of commu|nication with the Northern Parts, and re&s;train'd the Commerce between <HI>London</HI> and their A&s;&s;ociated Counties; which they well under&s;tood; and therefore, upon the fir&s;t News of it, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> removed his head Quarters from <HI>Wind&s;or</HI> to S^t <HI>Albans,</HI> and the Train'd-bands of <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>London,</HI> and their Auxiliary Regiments, marched again to him for his Recruit; upon the advancement whereof, and a mi&s;take of Orders from <HI>Oxford,</HI> S^r <HI>Lewis Dives</HI> drew off his Forces from <HI>Newport Pannel;</HI> and the Enemy pre&s;ently po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of it, and made it a very u&s;e|ful Garri&s;on. Upon which, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> Fortified <HI>To&s;&s;iter,</HI> a Town in <HI>Northampton-&s;hire,</HI> and left a &s;trong Garri&s;on there; which, though it infe&s;ted the Enemy &s;omewhat, and took great Revenge upon tho&s;e Counties which had expre&s;&s;ed a violent Affection to the Parliament, in truth, added little &s;trength to the King; for he lo&s;t many Hor&s;e by the labour of duty, the greate&s;t part of the Body of his Hor&s;e being forced <MILESTONE N="20"> to Quarter near that place, for the &s;ecurity of the Foot, till the Works about the Town were in &s;uch a forwardne&s;s, that they needed not fear their Neighbours at S^t <HI>Albans.</HI></P>
<P>IN the mean time, the power of the Parliament was lea&s;t Manife&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King's Affairs in the We&s;t.</NOTE> in the We&s;t, where their Party was reduced to a lowne&s;s, and confined within narrow limits, after the taking of <HI>Exeter;</HI> the Gentlemen of that County having been generally well devoted to the King's Service, though never able &s;afely to declare it, at lea&s;t to appear in a po&s;ture of oppo&s;ing the violence of the other Party. Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> found a ge|neral concurrence to advance the great work, by Levies of Money, <MILESTONE N="30"> Men, and all Offices that could be expected; in&s;omuch as, within very few days after the Surrender of that Town, his Army of Foot, by the new Levies, contained no fewer than &s;even thou&s;and Men (which was a Body the We&s;t had not before &s;een) be&s;ides a Body of Hor&s;e, at lea&s;t proportionable to the other; and all in excellent Equipage for Action. And at the &s;ame time, Colonel <HI>John Digby</HI> was before <HI>Plymouth,</HI> with above three thou&s;and Foot, and &s;ix hundred Hor&s;e, and had taken a work from the Enemy of great Importance, called <HI>Mount-Stamford</HI> in honour of that Earl during the time of his abode there, within half a mile of the Town, and which commanded &s;ome part of the River; the <MILESTONE N="40"> lo&s;s whereof gave the Town a marvellous di&s;couragement.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t Error the Prince committed after the reducing of <HI>Exeter,</HI> was &s;taying too long there before he advanced; for Victorious Armies carry great terror with them, whil&s;t the memory and fame of the Victory is fre&s;h. The next, that he moved not directly towards <HI>Plymouth,</HI> when he did move; which, in all probability, would have yeilded upon his Approach: for the Town was full of di&s;traction, and jealou&s;y among&s;t them&s;elves, as well as unprovided for the reception of an Enemy. It was a rich and populous Corporation, being, in time of Peace, the greate&s;t Port for Trade in the We&s;t; and, except <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> then more con|&s;iderable than all the re&s;t. There was in it a Ca&s;tle very &s;trong towards the Sea, with good Platforms and Ordnance; and little more than Mu&s;|quet &s;hot from the Town, was an I&s;land with a Fort in it, much &s;tronger
<PB N="303" REF="3500">
than the Ca&s;tle; both which were, before the Troubles, under the Com|mand of a Captain, with a Garri&s;on of about fifty Men at the mo&s;t; and were only intended for a &s;ecurity, and defence of the Town, again&s;t a Forreign Inva&s;ion; the Ca&s;tle and the I&s;land together, having a good Command of the entrance into the Harbour, but towards the Land there was very little &s;trength. This Command was in the hands of S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hley,</HI> and as unprovided to expect, or re&s;i&s;t an Enemy, as the other Ca&s;tles and Forts of the Kingdom; le&s;s for the receiving a Recruit; there being only Ordnance, and Ammunition, without any other Provi|&s;ions for the &s;upport of the Soldiers within the Walls; and the Garri&s;on it &s;elf <MILESTONE N="10"> being by time, Marriages, and Trade, incorporated into the Town, and rather Citizens than Soldiers: So that S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hley</HI> being &s;ent for to the King, before his &s;etting up his Standard, a&s;&s;oon as there was any apprehen&s;ion of a Party for the King in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> after the appear|ing of S^r <HI>Ralph Hopton,</HI> and tho&s;e other Gentlemen there, the Mayor, and Corporation of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> quickly got both the Ca&s;tle and I&s;land into their own Power.</P>
<P>IT will be wonder'd at by many hereafter, that tho&s;e, and the like places of Strength in <HI>England,</HI> being under the Command of Per&s;ons entirely of his Maje&s;ties Nomination, were not put into a good Po&s;ture <MILESTONE N="20"> of Defence, when it grew fir&s;t Evident, that there would be &s;hortly oc|ca&s;ion to u&s;e them; for according to the old &s;tory in <HI>Aelian,</HI> that when in one of the States of <HI>Greece, Micippus</HI>'s Sheep brought forth a Lyon, it was generally, and ju&s;tly concluded, that that portended a Tyranny, and change of the State from a peaceable to a bloody Government; &s;o when the two Hou&s;es of Parliament fir&s;t produced a Soveraign Power, to make, and alter, and &s;u&s;pend Laws, before they rai&s;ed an Army, or made a General, or declared War; when that mild and innocent Sheep, that Legal regular Convention of a &s;ober and mode&s;t Council, had once brought forth that Lyon, which &s;ought whom he might devour, it might <MILESTONE N="30"> be ea&s;ily, and naturally concluded by all wi&s;e and &s;ober Men, that the ble&s;&s;ed calm, and temperate State of Government, by which every Man eat the fruit of his own Vine, was at an end; and rapine, blood, and de|&s;olation, to &s;ucceed; and therefore that tho&s;e Holds &s;hould, in rea&s;on, have been then provided for.</P>
<P>BUT I &s;hall &s;ay here once for all, that from the time that there was any rea&s;onable jealou&s;y of a War, it was never in the King's Power to mend the condition of any of tho&s;e places; and if he had attempted it, with what caution or &s;ecrecy &s;oever, the inconvenience he mu&s;t have &s;u&s;tained by it, be&s;ides the failing of his end, would have been much <MILESTONE N="40"> greater than the Advantage which could have accrued, if he had done what he de&s;ired. I have very ill de&s;cribed the times We have pa&s;&s;ed through, if That be not apparent; and that it was rather an Error of the former times, that tho&s;e places needed any Supply, than that it was not applied to them in the &s;ucceeding.</P>
<P>THE Parliament was very glad <HI>Plymouth</HI> was thus &s;ecured; and, as well to put an obligation upon all Corporations, by &s;hewing they thought them capable of the greate&s;t Tru&s;ts, as becau&s;e they could not, in truth, more rea&s;onably Confide in any other, they committed the Government thereof to that Mayor; who was well enough in&s;tructed, what re&s;pect <MILESTONE N="50"> to pay to their Committee; which was appointed to re&s;ide there for his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and to conduct the Affairs in tho&s;e parts. Of that Com|mittee, S^r <HI>Alexander Carew</HI> was one; a Gentleman of a good Fortune
<PB N="304" REF="3510">
in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> who &s;erv'd in Parliament as Knight for that County, and had, from the beginning of the Parliament, concurr'd in all conclu&s;ions with the mo&s;t Violent, with as full a Te&s;timony of that zeal and fury, to which their confidence was applied, as any Man. To Him the Cu&s;tody and Government of that Fort, and I&s;land, which was looked upon as the Security of the Town, was committed; and a &s;ufficient Garri&s;on put into it. The Mayor commanded the Ca&s;tle, and the Town, about which a Line was ca&s;t up of Earth, weak, and irregular.</P>
<P>AFTER the Battle of <HI>Stratton,</HI> and the King's Forces prevailing &s;o far over the We&s;t, that <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> was taken by them, and <HI>Exeter</HI> clo&s;ely <MILESTONE N="10"> Be&s;ieged, S^r <HI>Alexander Carew</HI> begun to think, his I&s;land and Fort would hardly &s;ecure his E&s;tate in <HI>Cornwal;</HI> and under&s;tood the Law &s;o well (for he had had a good Education) to know, that the &s;ide he had cho&s;en, would be no longer the Better, than it &s;hould continue the Stronger; and having originally follow'd no other Motives, than of Popularity and Intere&s;ts, re&s;olv'd now to redeem his Errors; and found means to cor|re&s;pond with &s;ome of his old Friends and Neighbours in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and by them, to make a direct Overture to Surrender that Fort and I&s;land <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> Alexander Carew <HI>Treats to Surrender the Fort of</HI> Plymouth <HI>to the King's Forces, but is &s;urpri&s;ed.</HI></NOTE> to the King, upon an A&s;&s;urance of his Maje&s;ties Pardon, and a full re|mi&s;&s;ion of his Offences. S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> who then lay before <HI>Exeter,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> was the next Supreme Officer, qualified to entertain &s;uch a Treaty; and He, in&s;tantly, by the &s;ame conveyance, return'd him as ample A&s;&s;urance of his own conditions as could be; <Q>with advice, &startq;that he &s;hould not, upon any defect of forms (which, upon his engagement, &s;hould be &s;upplied with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, to his own &s;atisfaction) defer the con&s;ummating the work; which hereafter, po&s;&s;ibly, might not be in&endq; his power to effect:</Q> de&s;igns of that Nature being to be con&s;ulted and executed together; for in tho&s;e ca&s;es, according to <HI>Mutianus</HI> in <HI>Tacitus, Qui deliberant, de&s;civerunt;</HI> and the greate&s;t danger attends the not going on. But he was &s;o &s;otti&s;hly, and dangerou&s;ly wary of his own Se|curity <MILESTONE N="30"> (having neither Courage enough to obey his Con&s;cience, nor Wickedne&s;s enough to be pro&s;perous again&s;t it) that he would not pro|ceed, till he was &s;ufficiently a&s;&s;ured, that his Pardon was pa&s;&s;ed the Great Seal of <HI>England;</HI> before which time, though all imaginable ha&s;t was made, by the Treachery of a Servant whom he tru&s;ted, his Treaty and De&s;ign was di&s;cover'd to the Mayor, and the re&s;t of the Committee; and, according to the diligence u&s;ed by that Party, in ca&s;es of &s;uch con|cernment, he was &s;uddainly, and without re&s;i&s;tance, &s;urpri&s;ed in his Fort, and carried Pri&s;oner into <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and from thence, by Sea, &s;ent to <HI>London;</HI> where what became of him, will be remember'd in it's <MILESTONE N="40"> place.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after this accident, Colonel <HI>Digby</HI> came before the Town; and though the great damage was by this means prevented, yet it can|not be imagined, but the People were in great di&s;traction, with the ap|prehen&s;ion of the danger they had e&s;caped; and tho&s;e di&s;coveries bring allways that Melancholy with them, that Men are not quickly again brought to a confidence in one another. For no Man had, to common under&s;tanding, better de&s;erv'd to be tru&s;ted, or given le&s;s Argument for Su&s;picion: And upon &s;uch a defection, who could hope to &s;tand free from jealou&s;y? Be&s;ides he could not but have had much familiarity with <MILESTONE N="50"> many in the Town, which mu&s;t &s;ubject them to &s;ome Su&s;picion, or, at+lea&s;t, make them &s;u&s;pect that they were &s;u&s;pected; and without doubt, it awaken'd many to apprehend the immediate hand of God in the
<PB N="305" REF="3520">
Judgement, that he would not &s;uffer a Man to recover the Security, and Comfort of his Allegiance, who had &s;o &s;ignally departed from it again&s;t the light of his own Con&s;cience; and that a Man, who had been before precipitate again&s;t all rea&s;on, &s;hould peri&s;h by con&s;idering too much, when precipitation was only rea&s;onable.</P>
<P>THE fame of the winning of <HI>Exeter,</HI> by which a Victorious Army was at liberty to vi&s;it them, and then the lo&s;s of <HI>Mount-Stamford,</HI> which was their only con&s;iderable Fortification to the Land, with tho&s;e other di&s;compo&s;ures, wrought a wonderful con&s;ternation among&s;t them; and made them con&s;ider, that if they could hold out, and defend their Town, <MILESTONE N="10"> the Country being all lo&s;t, they mu&s;t lo&s;e all their Trade, and &s;o from Merchants become only Soldiers; which was not the condition they contended for. In&s;omuch as the Mayor him&s;elf was not without a pro|pen&s;ity to &s;end for a Treaty, upon which the Town might be deliver'd to the King: and it was by many then believ'd, that if Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> had then marched from <HI>Exeter</HI> before it, that Treaty would infallibly have en&s;ued. But, when I &s;ay it was an error that he did Not, I intend it rather as a Misfortune than a Fault; for his Highne&s;s was an utter &s;tranger in tho&s;e parts; and therefore was not, without great appearance of rea&s;on, per&s;waded fir&s;t to bend his cour&s;e to <HI>Dartmo$$h;</HI> <Q>which was <MILESTONE N="20"> looked upon &startq;as an ea&s;y work, and a Harbour, which, b$$ng got, would draw a very good Trade: and that &s;hort work being perform'd, <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> would have the le&s;s Courage to make re&s;i&s;tance; and if it &s;hould,&endq; it were much fitter for the Winter,</Q> <Q>which was now drawing on (for it was more than the middle of <HI>September)</HI> &startq;than the other, by rea&s;on of the conveniency of good accommodation for the Soldiers, near about&endq; it; which could not be had about <HI>Dartmouth.</HI></Q></P>
<P>UPON the&s;e rea&s;ons, he marched directly to <HI>Dartmouth;</HI> which, how unfit &s;oever to make a Defence again&s;t &s;uch an Army, by the di&s;|advantage <MILESTONE N="$0"> of Situation, and the want of all tho&s;e helps which u&s;e to make a Garri&s;on confident, he found in no temper and di&s;po&s;ition to yeild; &s;o that he &s;ate down before it. And &s;hortly after, there came &s;o <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Mau|rice <HI>&s;it$ down before</HI> Dart|mouth; <HI>and takes it:</HI></NOTE> violent a Sea&s;on of Rain, and foul Weather, that very many of his Men, with lying on the ground, fell &s;ick, and died; and more, run away. Yet, after near a Months Siege, and the lo&s;s of many good Men (whereof the &s;ame Colonel <HI>Chudleigh,</HI> of whom We &s;poke before, was one, a Gal|lant young Gentleman, who receiv'd a &s;hot with a Mu&s;quet in the Body, of which he died within few days, and was a wonderful lo&s;s to the King's Service) it was given up on fair conditions; and then the Prince, having <MILESTONE N="$0"> placed a Garri&s;on there, under the Command of Colonel <HI>Seymour,</HI> a Gentleman of principal account and intere&s;t in <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> lo&s;t no more time, but, with all convenient expedition, marched to <HI>Plymouth;</HI> which was not now in the State it had been; for the Parliament being quickly inform'd, how terrible an impre&s;&s;ion the lo&s;s of allmo&s;t all other Parts of the We&s;t, had made upon the Spirits of that People, had before this time &s;ent a recruit of five hundred Men, and a <HI>Scotch</HI> Officer to be Go|vernour; who ea&s;ed the Mayor of that unequal Charge, and quickly made it evident, that nothing but a peremptory defence was thought of.

<P>THOUGH the King's Succe&s;s, and good Fortune, had met with a

check in the relief of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and the Battle of <HI>Newbury,</HI> yet his condition &s;eem'd mightily improved by the whole Summers Service. For whereas he &s;eem'd before confined, upon the matter, within <HI>Oxford-&s;hire,</HI> and half <HI>Berk-&s;hire</HI> (which half was lo&s;t too upon the lo&s;s of <HI>Read|ing</HI> in the Spring) and the Parties which appeared for him in other Coun|ties, &s;eem'd rather &s;ufficient to hinder a general Union again&s;t him, than that they were like to reduce them to his devotion; he was now, upon the matter, Ma&s;ter of the whole We&s;t; <HI>Cornwal</HI> was his own without a Rival; <HI>Plymouth</HI> was the only place, in all <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> unreduced; and tho&s;e Forces &s;hut within their own Walls: the large, rich County <MILESTONE N="10"> of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> with <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> entirely His: In <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> the Enemy had only too little fi&s;her Towns, <HI>Poole</HI> and <HI>Lyme;</HI> all the re&s;t was de|clared for the King. And in every of the&s;e Counties, he had plenty of Harbours and Ports, to &s;upply him with Ammunition, and the Coun|try with Trade. In <HI>Wilt-&s;hire</HI> the Enemy had not the lea&s;t footing, and rather a Town or two in <HI>Hamp&s;hire</HI> than any po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the County; that People being generally undevoted to them: The whole Princi|pality of <HI>Wales,</HI> except a Sea Town or two in <HI>Pembroke-&s;hire,</HI> was at his devotion; and that unfortunately ob&s;tinate Town of <HI>Glouce&s;ter</HI> only kept him from commanding the whole <HI>Severn.</HI> The Parliament was <MILESTONE N="20"> nothing &s;tronger in <HI>Shrop&s;hire, Che&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> than they were in the beginning of the year. And albeit the Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> had been forced to ri&s;e as unfortunately from <HI>Hull,</HI> as the King had been from <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> yet he had &s;till a full power over <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> and a greater in <HI>Nottingham-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln-&s;hire,</HI> than the Parliament had. So that he might be thought to be now &s;trong enough to make War; the contrary opinion whereof had been one of the greate&s;t rea&s;ons that there was no Peace. And therefore Many believ'd, that, what ap|pearance &s;oever there was of ob&s;tinacy, the Winter would produce &s;ome Overtures of Accommodation; and that all the noi&s;e of preparation <MILESTONE N="30"> from <HI>Scotland,</HI> was only to incline the King to the greater conde&s;cen|&s;ions; and that, in truth, they who had pretended the concurrent de&s;ire of the People, as the be&s;t rea&s;on for what&s;oever they had propo&s;ed, and traduced the King with a purpo&s;e of bringing Forreign Forces to awe, and impo&s;e upon his own Subjects, would not now have the hardine&s;s to bring in a &s;tranger Nation to invade their Country, and to compel that People, by who&s;e Affections they would be thought to be guided, to &s;ubmit to Changes they had no mind to receive. And the Arrival of the Count of <HI>Harcourt,</HI> as Extraordinary Emba&s;&s;adour from the Crown <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Conte</HI> d'Harcourt <HI>Arrives Em|ba&s;&s;adour from</HI> France.</NOTE> of <HI>France,</HI> was looked upon as an expedient to u&s;her in &s;ome Treaty, <MILESTONE N="40"> and to remove tho&s;e ceremonies, and preliminary Propo&s;itions, which, by rea&s;on of the mutual Declarations, and Prote&s;tations again&s;t each other, might be thought of greater difficulty, than any real differences between them.</P>
<P>THE King him&s;elf was not without expectation of notable Effects from this Emba&s;&s;y; for the State of <HI>France</HI> &s;eem'd to be much alter'd from what it was, at the beginning of the&s;e Troubles. Cardinal <HI>Riche|lieu,</HI> who, the King well knew, had more than fomented the Troubles both in <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> was now dead; and the King of <HI>France</HI> him&s;elf likewi&s;e; and tho&s;e old Mini&s;ters of State who had been long in the <HI>Ba&s;tile,</HI> or Bani&s;hed, were now &s;et at liberty, and recalled, and in favour; the Queen Mother made Regent; who profe&s;&s;ed great per|&s;onal kindne&s;s to the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o great a &s;en&s;e of the

<P>HIS Reception at <HI>London</HI> was with much &s;olemnity, that he might not find there was any ab&s;ence of Ceremony or State, by the ab&s;ence of the King; yet, when he had a &s;afe Conduct for <HI>Oxford,</HI> his Carriages were &s;topped at the going out of <HI>London,</HI> and his own Coach, as well as all other places, &s;earched with great and unu&s;ual rudene&s;s, upon &s;u&s;pi|cion that he carried Letters; and though he expo&s;tulated the Affront, as a high violation of his Honour, and Priviledge, he receiv'd no man|ner <MILESTONE N="30"> of reparation, or the Officer, that did it, any reprehen&s;ion; which made many believe, that he would have been very keen in the re&s;ent|ment. The King expected that, by this Emba&s;&s;adour, the Crown of <HI>France</HI> would have made a brisk Declaration on his Maje&s;ties behalf; and if the Parliament &s;hould not return to their regular Obedience, that they &s;hould have found no corre&s;pondence, or reception in that King|dom; and that they would really a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty, in &s;uch manner as he &s;hould propo&s;e; which Declaration, he thought, would prove of moment with the City of <HI>London,</HI> in re&s;pect of their Trade; but more with the <HI>Scots,</HI> who were under&s;tood to have an e&s;pecial dependence <MILESTONE N="$0"> upon <HI>France.</HI></P>
<P>WHEN the Emba&s;&s;adour return'd from his Audience at <HI>Oxford,</HI> where he &s;tayed not many days, he &s;ent a paper to the Earl of <HI>Northum|berland,</HI> <Q>by which he de&s;ired his Lord&s;hip, &startq;to impart to the Me&s;&s;ieurs of Parliament, that he had made known to their Maje&s;ties, the Af|fectionate de&s;ire the King his Ma&s;ter, and the Queen his Mi&s;tre&s;s, had to contribute all good Offices, in the procurement of Peace, and Tranquillity in this Kingdom; to which he found the de&s;ires of their Maje&s;ties well di&s;po&s;ed; and therefore he de&s;ired to know, whe|ther his Lord&s;hip thought the two Hou&s;es did corre&s;pond in the &s;ame intention; if they did, after they &s;hould make him under&s;tand the Subject that had obliged them to take up Armes, he would in|terpo&s;e to pacify the differences, by &s;uch expedients, as &s;hould be

&endq; mo&s;t conformable to the ancient Laws, and Cu&s;toms of the Realm.</Q></P>
<P>AFTER the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> had inform'd the Hou&s;e of Peers of this repre&s;entation, it was, at a Conference, imparted to the Hou&s;e of Commons, and an An&s;wer was framed by joynt agreement, to be return'd by the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> to the Emba&s;&s;adour. In the form of it, they gave him the Title of <HI>Prince of Harcourt,</HI> and <HI>Grand E&s;cuier of France;</HI> but omitted that of <HI>Extraordinary Emba&s;|&s;adour in England,</HI> becau&s;e it did not appear to the Parliament, by Let|ters of Credence, or the &s;ight of his In&s;tructions from the King, or Queen Regent of <HI>France,</HI> that he was by them employed Extraordinary Em|ba&s;&s;adour <MILESTONE N="10"> into <HI>England.</HI></P>
<P><Q>THE An&s;wer it &s;elf was, &startq;that the Lords and Commons in Parlia|ment did, with all due Re&s;pects, accept of the Affectionate de&s;ires of the King, and Queen Regent of <HI>France,</HI> to contribute good Offices, towards the procuring a happy Peace; and that, when the &s;aid Mon|&s;ieur <HI>le Prince d'Harcourt</HI> &s;hould make any &s;uch Propo&s;itions to the Parliament, by Authority from their Maje&s;ties of <HI>France,</HI> they would give then &s;uch an An&s;wer to the &s;ame, as might &s;tand with the In|tere&s;t&endq; of both Kingdoms, and their late &s;olemn League and Covenant.</Q> <Q>The Lords propo&s;ed, &startq;that there might be a Committee appointed to&endq; <MILESTONE N="$0"> Treat with the Emba&s;&s;adour:</Q> <Q>But the Commons would by no means con&s;ent to it, &startq;till he &s;hould make it manife&s;t, that he had Authority&endq; from his Ma&s;ter to Treat with the Parliament;</Q> <Q>and withall they de|clared, &startq;that if he had, at any time, any thing farther to offer to them, they would not receive it from any particular Member of either Hou&s;e; but that he &s;hould apply him&s;elf by writing, or otherwi&s;e, to the Speaker of either, or both Hou&s;es of Parliament; otherwi&s;e, they&endq; would hold no corre&s;pondence with him.</Q> The ground of this re&s;olu|tion was, that they might draw from the Emba&s;&s;adour (which they pre|&s;umed could not be without the Privity, and Approbation of the King) <MILESTONE N="$0"> an Addre&s;s, and Acknowledgement that they were a Parliament, again&s;t the Freedom whereof, and con&s;equently the pre&s;ent Being, his Maje&s;ty had, by his late Proclamation, declared. So the Emba&s;&s;adour, after a Journey or two to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and &s;ome perfunctory Adde&s;&s;es to the Hou&s;es, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Returns into</HI> France <HI>with out any good effect to the King.</HI></NOTE> return'd to <HI>France re infecta,</HI> and without the lea&s;t expre&s;&s;ion of di&s;like, on his Ma&s;ter's behalf, of their proceedings.</P>
<P>SOME were &s;crupulous in believing that <HI>France</HI> really intended to repair the mi&s;chief it had done; and ob&s;erv'd, that though there were &s;ome plau&s;ible compliances, in point of Ceremony, with particular Per|&s;ons, after the death of the former Cardinal; yet, that the main Coun|&s;els <MILESTONE N="$0"> were carried on upon the Rules and Directions he had left; and that the Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> a Per&s;on who had been of the highe&s;t tru&s;t with the other, wholely now pre&s;ided over tho&s;e Coun&s;els; and con|&s;ider'd, how much <HI>France</HI> might imagine it would conduce to their In|tere&s;t, that the King of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould not have all his Subjects in per|fect Obedience, le&s;t he might offer to be an Arbiter of their great dif|ferences: I &s;ay, the&s;e Men believ'd Count <HI>Harcourt</HI>'s In&s;tructions pri|vately were no other, than the la&s;t Emba&s;&s;adour's; whom the King had cau&s;ed to be recalled. And it cannot be denied, that they who were in|clined to that jealou&s;y, had arguments enough to encrea&s;e it.</P>
<P>WHEN this Extraordinary Emba&s;&s;adour was appointed to come for <HI>England,</HI> M^r <HI>Mountague</HI> was in the Court of <HI>France,</HI> very much tru&s;ted by both their Maje&s;ties, and by his Quality, and near relation to &s;o great
<PB N="309" REF="3560">
a Tru&s;t, his long conver&s;ation in that Court, and a &s;ingular dexterity in his Nature, adorn'd with excellent Parts, was thought to have a very good place in the favour, and particular e&s;timation of that Queen Regent, and in the opinion of the Cardinal; to whom he had been u&s;eful. With this Gentleman mo&s;t of the conclu&s;ions had been tran&s;acted, which were preparatory to the Emba&s;&s;adour's Journey; and it was thought fit, that He &s;hould at the &s;ame time come into <HI>England;</HI> and, in &s;uch a di&s;gui&s;e, as might ea&s;ily conceal a Man better known in <HI>France</HI> than in his own Country, in the Emba&s;&s;adour's Train find a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age to <HI>Oxford;</HI> which was carried with &s;o much &s;ecrecy, that, be&s;ides to the Emba&s;&s;a|dour <MILESTONE N="10"> him&s;elf, he was known to very few of his Retinue. The Count of <HI>Harcourt</HI> was not Landed four and twenty hours, but in his Journey towards <HI>London,</HI> a Me&s;&s;enger from the Parliament apprehended M^r <HI>Mountague,</HI> and carried him a Pri&s;oner to the Hou&s;es; by whom he was committed to the Tower; and though the Emba&s;&s;adour made a great &s;hew of re&s;enting it, he never claimed him in &s;uch a manner, as to pro|cure his Enlargement; which made Men believe, the Cardinal liked well his confinement, and de&s;ired not he &s;hould be either at <HI>Oxford</HI> or <HI>Paris.</HI></P>
<P><Q>AT the Emba&s;&s;adour's fir&s;t coming to <HI>Oxford,</HI> after ge$eral Overtures, <MILESTONE N="20"> and Declarations of the re&s;olution of that Crown, &startq;to give his Maje&s;ty&endq; all po&s;&s;ible A&s;&s;i&s;tance for his ree&s;tabli&s;hment, he propo&s;ed a League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive with the King.</Q> His Maje&s;ty, that knew well &s;uch an Offer was not to be rejected, le&s;t they &s;hould from thence take an occa&s;ion to refu&s;e tho&s;e things he &s;hould propo&s;e, appointed a Com|mittee of his Council (according to the u&s;ual Cour&s;e) to Treat with the Emba&s;&s;adour, upon all nece&s;&s;ary Articles, which &s;hould attend &s;uch a Treaty; declaring an Inclination to enter into &s;uch a League, as was propo&s;ed; <Q>and thereupon de&s;ired &startq;a pre&s;ent Loan of Money, and a &s;upply of a good proportion of Armes, and Ammunition; and like|wi&s;e <MILESTONE N="30"> that the Crown of <HI>France</HI> would declare again&s;t the Subjects of <HI>England,</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> who &s;hould per&s;i&s;t in Rebellion; according to&endq; an Article ratified in the la&s;t Treaty now in force.</Q></P>
<P>THE Emba&s;&s;adour, who, it &s;eems, expected that there &s;hould have been more pau&s;es in the Overture of the League Offen&s;ive and Defen|&s;ive, for the pre&s;ent declined the Treating with the Committee; <Q>alledg|ing, &startq;that he was, upon the matter, a Mini&s;ter of both their Maje&s;ties; and was to receive Command from them, and wholely to attend their Service; and therefore that he de&s;ired wholely to communicate with&endq; their Maje&s;ties them&s;elves:</Q> and &s;hortly after waved any farther men|tion <MILESTONE N="40"> of the League, <Q>with an affected complement, &startq;that it would not appear a generous thing, to pre&s;s the King to any Act in this his di&s;tre&s;s, which he had made &s;cruple of con&s;enting to heretofore, when the For|tune of both Crowns were equally Pro&s;perous: but that his Ma&s;ter and Mi&s;tre&s;s, would frankly contribute all that could be rea&s;onably expected from them, towards his Maje&s;ties Re&s;toration, and E&s;tabli&s;h|ment; and afterwards expect &s;uch a return of Affection from his Ma|je&s;ty, as the greatne&s;s of the obligation &s;hould merit in his Princely&endq; e&s;timation.</Q> And at the &s;ame time, the Queen Regent and Cardinal po&s;itively denied to the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour Extraordinary then <MILESTONE N="50"> from his Maje&s;ty in <HI>France,</HI> that ever the Count of <HI>Harcourt</HI> had any In&s;truction to mention a League Offen&s;ive and Defen&s;ive. The&s;e parti|cular carriages, and his not re&s;enting the Indignities, offer'd to him by

the Parliament, made many Men believe, that this Emba&s;&s;adour, not|with&s;tanding all the &s;pecious profe&s;&s;ions, was &s;ent rather to foment, than extingui&s;h the fire that was kindled. Certain it is, during his &s;tay in <HI>England,</HI> he did not, in the lea&s;t degree, advance the King's Service; and at his return, left the Parliament more united among&s;t them&s;elves again&s;t the King, and the <HI>Scots</HI> more advanced towards their coming in, than he found them; there being at the &s;ame time likewi&s;e a <HI>French</HI> Agent in <HI>Scotland;</HI> who produced no alteration in the Affections of that People, to the King's Advantage.</P>
<P>THE return of the three Earls, formerly mention'd, to <HI>London</HI> in <MILESTONE N="10"> the Winter, who &s;o &s;olemnly applied them&s;elves to the King in the Spring, contributed exceedingly to the Union of the two Hou&s;es at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter.</HI> The other two &s;tay'd longer; and retired with much more decency, if not with a tacit permi&s;&s;ion. But the Earl of <HI>Holland,</HI> when he &s;aw his place in the Bed-Chamber conferr'd upon the Marquis of <HI>Hertford,</HI> in much di&s;content, found an opportunity, which was not difficult, to remove out of the King's Quarters; and before he was mi&s;s'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> Intelligence was brought that he had render'd him&s;elf to the Parliament at <HI>London;</HI> <Q>and to make his return the more con&s;cientious, he declared, as hath been &s;aid, &startq;that the ground of his de&s;erting them <MILESTONE N="20"> formerly, and going to the King, was a hope to incline his Maje&s;ty to a Treaty of Peace; but that he found he was mi&s;taken in the temper of the <HI>Oxford</HI> Coun&s;els; and that the King had &s;till about him &s;ome Coun&s;ellors, who would never con&s;ent to a &s;afe, and well grounded Peace; and that he heard they had per&s;waded the King, to make a Ce&s;|&s;ation with the Rebels in <HI>Ireland;</HI> which affected his con&s;cience &s;o much, that, though he had been &s;ure to have lo&s;t his life by it, he would&endq; return to the Parliament; profe&s;&s;ing exemplary fidelity to them, if they would again receive him into their favour.</Q></P>
<P>IT may be, his di&s;cour&s;e of <HI>Ireland,</HI> or the King's Aver&s;ne&s;s to Peace, <MILESTONE N="30"> wrought upon very few; but the Evidence of the King's aver&s;ion &s;o far to forgive, and forget former tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, as to receive them into favour and tru&s;t again, made a deep impre&s;&s;ion upon many. For it is undoubted|ly true, that many of the principal and governing Members of both Hou&s;es, that is, of them who had govern'd, and done as much mi&s;chief as any, either out of apprehen&s;ion that the King would prevail, or that They &s;hould not prevail &s;oon enough, or the animo&s;ity again&s;t tho&s;e who had outgrown their Government, and followed new Leaders of their own, and to other ends than had been originally propo&s;ed, or out of &s;ome motions of Con&s;cience, were quite weary of the Parliament, and <MILESTONE N="40"> de&s;irous to obtain a fair admi&s;&s;ion to the King; and looked only upon the footing which tho&s;e Doves, which went fir&s;t out of the Ark, &s;hould find; and &s;urely, if that expedient had been dextrou&s;ly managed, it had been the mo&s;t probable way to have drawn the Parliament into &s;uch contempt, that it mu&s;t have fallen of it &s;elf: A way, that in no Civil War, which is arrived to any vigour and power of contending, ought to be declined. For a Body, that is not form'd by Policy, with any avowed and fixed Principles of Government, but by the di&s;temper'd Affections, Ambition, and Di&s;content of particular Per&s;ons, who rather agree again&s;t a common Adver&s;ary, than are united to one ju&s;t Intere&s;t, cannot &s;o <MILESTONE N="50"> ea&s;ily be di&s;&s;olved, as by Treating with particular Per&s;ons, and rending tho&s;e Branches from the Trunk, who&s;e beauty and advantage con&s;i&s;ts only in the &s;preading.</P>

THE rea&s;ons were unan&s;werable, which the old Con&s;ul <HI>Fabius</HI> in <HI>Livy Lib.</HI> 24. gave, in the Ca&s;e of <HI>Ca&s;&s;ius Altinius,</HI> who, after the De|feat of <HI>Cannae,</HI> de&s;erted the <HI>Romans</HI> and fled to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> by which he got the City of <HI>Arpos;</HI> and when the Condition of the <HI>Romans</HI> was again recover'd and flouri&s;hing, came again to the <HI>Roman</HI> Army, and offer'd to betray that City into their hands. <Q>&startq;Many were of opinion, that he &s;hould be looked upon as a Common Enemy; and bound, and &s;ent to <HI>Hannibal,</HI> as a perfidious Per&s;on, who knew neither how to&endq; be a Friend, nor an Enemy.</Q> <HI>Fabius</HI> reprehended the un&s;ea&s;onable &s;e|verity of tho&s;e who con&s;ider'd, and judged in <HI>medio ardore belli, tan|quam</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>in pace libera,</HI> <Q>and told them, &startq;that their principal care mu&s;t be, that none of their Friends and Allies might for&s;ake them; the next, that they who had for&s;aken them, might return again into their Obe|dience, and Protection: For, <HI>&s;i abire &agrave; Romanis liceat, redire ad eos non liceat,</HI> it could not be, but the State of <HI>Rome,</HI> from which, in&endq; the late misfortunes, many had revolted, mu&s;t become very de&s;perate.</Q></P>
<P>SUCH was the King's condition, the Number of the Guilty being &s;o much &s;uperior to the Innocent, that the latter could rea&s;onably expect only to be pre&s;erved by the conver&s;ion and reduction of the former.

What&s;oever damage his Maje&s;ty &s;u&s;tained, that unfortunate Earl receiv'd no acknowledgement, or en|couragement from the other Party, who had the benefit of his return; but as his E&s;tate was &s;eque&s;ter'd a&s;&s;oon as he left them, &s;o he was now committed to Pri&s;on, and that &s;eque&s;tration continued; neither was it, in a long time after, taken off, nor him&s;elf ever after admitted to his place in their Council, notwith&s;tanding all the interce&s;&s;ion of very power|ful Friends, or to any reputation of doing farther good or hurt. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>

<P>THE Seal then was deliver'd, in the Hou&s;e of Commons, to their Speaker; and by Him, with much &s;olemnity, the Hou&s;e attending him, to the Speaker of the Peers, at the Bar in that Hou&s;e. <Q>The &s;ix Com|mi&s;&s;ioners were then, in the pre&s;ence of both Hou&s;es, &s;olemnly &s;worn &startq;to execute the Office of Keepers of the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> in all things according to the Orders, and Directions of both Hou&s;es of Par|liament.&endq;</Q> And thereupon the Seal was deliver'd by the two Speakers <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Seal deli|ver'd to &s;ix Commi&s;&s;ioners.</NOTE> to them, who carried it, according to Order, to the Hou&s;e of the Clerk of the Parliament, in the old Palace; where it was kept locked up in a <MILESTONE N="$0"> Che&s;t; which could not be open'd but in the pre&s;ence of three of them, and with three &s;everal Keys. This work being over, they appointed, for the fir&s;t exerci&s;e of this kind of Soveraignty, a Patent to be &s;ealed to the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> of Lord High Admiral of <HI>England;</HI> which was done accordingly; by which many concluded, that the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who had been put out of that great Office, for Their &s;akes, was not re&s;tored to their full confidence; others, that he de&s;ired not to wear Their Livery.</P>
<P>ABOUT the &s;ame time, to &s;hew that they would be Ab&s;olute, and not joynt Sharers in the Soveraign Power, they gave an In&s;tance of <MILESTONE N="$0"> boldne&s;s mingled with cruelty, that made them appear very terrible. The King had publi&s;hed &s;everal Proclamations, for the Adjournment of the Term from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Oxford,</HI> which had been hitherto fruitle&s;s, for want of the nece&s;&s;ary Legal form of having the Writs read in Court; &s;o that the Judges at <HI>Oxford,</HI> who were ready to perform their Duty, could not regularly keep the Courts there; which el&s;e they would have done, notwith&s;tanding the Order and Declarations publi&s;hed by the two Hou&s;es to the contrary; they who were learned in the Law, believing that A&s;&s;umption to be unque&s;tionably out of their juri&s;diction. The&s;e Writs of Adjournment had never yet been deliver'd &s;ea&s;onably, to be <MILESTONE N="$0"> read in Court, or into the hands of either of the &s;worn Judges who yet attended at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter:</HI> of which there were three in Number, Ju&s;tice <HI>Bacon</HI> in the King's Bench, Ju&s;tice <HI>Reeve</HI> in the Common Pleas, and

Baron <HI>Trevor</HI> in the Exchequer; who, how timerous &s;oever, and appre|hen&s;ive of the power and &s;everity of the Parliament, knowing the Law and their Dutys, Men believ'd, would not have barefaced declined the execution of tho&s;e Commands they were &s;worn to ob&s;erve. Several Me&s;&s;engers were therefore &s;ent from <HI>Oxford</HI> with tho&s;e Writs; <Q>and ap|pointed, on, or before &s;uch a day (for that circum&s;tance was penal) &startq;to find an opportunity, to deliver the Writs into the hands of the &s;e|veral&endq; Judges.</Q> Two of them perform'd their Charges, and deliver'd the Writs to Ju&s;tice <HI>Reeve,</HI> and Baron <HI>Trevor;</HI> who immediately cau&s;ed the Me&s;&s;engers to be apprehended. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P><Q>THE Hou&s;es, being inform'd of it, gave direction, &startq;that they &s;hould&endq; be tried by a Council of War, as Spies;</Q> which was done at <HI>E&s;&s;ex-</HI>Hou&s;e. <Q>The Me&s;&s;engers alledged, &startq;that they were &s;worn Servants to his Maje&s;ty for the tran&s;action of tho&s;e Services, for which they were now ac|cu&s;ed; and that they had been legally puni&s;hable, if they had refu&s;ed&endq; to do their duties;</Q> the Term being to be adjourn'd by no other way.

The other, after he had &s;tood &s;ome time upon, or under the Gallows, looking for the &s;ame conclu&s;ion, was repreived, and &s;ent to <HI>Bridewell;</HI> where he was kept long after, till he made an E&s;cape, and return'd again to <HI>Oxford.</HI> This Example begot great terror in all the well affected about <HI>London,</HI> and &s;o much the more, becau&s;e, about the &s;ame time, <Q>an Ordinance was made, &startq;that who&s;oever went to <HI>Oxford,</HI> or into any of the King's Quar|ters, <MILESTONE N="30"> without leave from one of the Hou&s;es, or a Pa&s;s from their Ge|neral, or who&s;oever had any corre&s;pondence with any Per&s;on in the King's Quarters, by writing Letters, or receiving Letters from thence, &s;hould be proceeded again&s;t as a Per&s;on di&s;affected to the State; and his Per&s;on committed, and his E&s;tate &s;eque&s;ter'd; and &s;hould be liable, according to the circum&s;tances (of which them&s;elves would be only&endq; Judges) to be tried as Spies.</Q></P>
<P>AS this made them exceeding terrible to tho&s;e who loved them not, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Coll.</HI> Fiennes <HI>tried for Sur|rendering</HI> Bri|&s;tol, <HI>and con|demn'd; but pardon'd by the General.</HI></NOTE> &s;o, about the &s;ame time, they gave another In&s;tance of Severity, which render'd their Government no le&s;s reverenced among&s;t their Friends, <MILESTONE N="40"> and A&s;&s;ociates. The brave Defence of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and the great Succe&s;s that attended it, made the lo&s;s of <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> the more felt by the Parlia|ment; and con&s;equently the delivery, and yeilding it up, the more li|berally &s;poken of, and cen&s;ur'd. <Q>The which Colonel <HI>Fiennes</HI> having not patience to bear, he de&s;ired, being a Member of the Hou&s;e of Commons, and of a &s;waying Intere&s;t there, &startq;that he might be put to give an Ac|count of it, at a Court of War, which was the proper Judicature upon&endq; tre&s;pa&s;&s;es of that Nature.</Q> And in the mean time, he was powerful enough, upon &s;ome collateral, and circum&s;tantial pa&s;&s;ages, to procure &s;ome of the Chief who inveighed again&s;t him, to be impri&s;on'd, and re|prehended. This begot greater Pa&s;&s;ion and Animo&s;ity in the Per&s;ons, that thought they &s;uffer'd unju&s;tly, and only by the Authority, and In|tere&s;t of the Colonel and his Father; which, by degrees, brought Faction

into the Hou&s;e of Commons, and the Army, according to the &s;everal Affections and Tempers of Men.</P>
<P>THERE were but two Pro&s;ecuters appear'd, one M^r <HI>Walker,</HI> a Gen|tleman of <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> of a good Fortune, and, by the lo&s;s of that, the more provoked; who had been in the Town when it was lo&s;t, and had &s;trictly ob&s;erved all that was done, or &s;aid; and the famous M^r <HI>Pryn,</HI> who had at fir&s;t let him&s;elf into the di&s;qui&s;ition of that bu&s;ine&s;s, out of the Activity, and re&s;tle&s;sne&s;s of his Nature, and was afterwards &s;harpen'd by contempt. The&s;e two, under pretence of Zeal to the Kingdom, and that &s;uch an irreparable damage to it might not pa&s;s away without due <MILESTONE N="10"> puni&s;hment, undertook the pro&s;ecution; and boldly charged the Co|lonel with Cowardi&s;e, and Treachery; and gave &s;everal In&s;tances of great and high profe&s;&s;ions, and performances faint, and not an&s;werable; with &s;ome mixtures of pride, and love of Money, throughout the Cour&s;e of his Government. Colonel <HI>Fiennes,</HI> be&s;ides the credit and reputation of his Father, had a very good &s;tock of e&s;timation in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons upon his own &s;core; for truly he had very good parts of Learn|ing, and Nature, and was privy to, and a great Manager in, the mo&s;t &s;ecret de&s;igns from the beginning; and if he had not $$cumber'd him|&s;elf with Command in the Army, to which Men thought his Nature <MILESTONE N="20"> not &s;o well di&s;po&s;ed, he had &s;ure been &s;econd to none in tho&s;e Councils, after M^r <HI>Hambden</HI>'s death. This made him too much de&s;pi&s;e tho&s;e who appear'd his Adver&s;aries, and others whom he knew to be &s;uch, though they appear'd not (for he looked upon S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> as an Enemy, who, by his misfortune at <HI>Roundway-</HI>Down, having brought that &s;torm upon <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> was indu&s;trious to make the &s;econd lo&s;s to be apprehended only as the effect of the other's want of Courage, and Conduct) and be|ing &s;ure, that he was very free from wi&s;hing well to the King, he thought no defect would be farther imputed to him, than might well be an&s;wer'd by the having done his Be&s;t; and that the eminency of his perfect Zeal <MILESTONE N="30"> again&s;t his Maje&s;ty, would weigh down all objections of di&s;&s;ervice to the Parliament.</P>
<P>BUT notwith&s;tanding all this, after a long and &s;olemn hearing before the Court of War, at S^t <HI>Albans,</HI> where the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> then lay, which took up many days, <Q>he was condemn'd to lo&s;e his head, &startq;for not having&endq; defended <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> &s;o well, and &s;o long, as he ought to have done.</Q> And though he had afterwards a pardon for his life, granted to him by the Prerogative of the General, under his Hand and Seal, yet the infamy of the judgement could not be taken off; by which he became unfit to continue an Officer of the Army; and the &s;hame of it per&s;waded him <MILESTONE N="40"> to quit the Kingdom; &s;o that he went for &s;ome time into Forreign Parts, retaining &s;till the &s;ame full di&s;actection to the Government of the Church and State, and only griev'd that he had a le&s;s capacity left to do hurt to either. Many looked upon this Example, as a foundation of great awe, and reverence in the Army, that the Officers might &s;ee, that no Titles or Relations &s;hould be able to break through the &s;trict di&s;cipline of War. For this Gentleman was a Per&s;on of &s;ingular merit, and fide|lity to the Party that he &s;erved, and of extraordinary u&s;e to them in tho&s;e Coun&s;els that required the be&s;t under&s;tandings. Others thought it an Act of unadvi&s;ed &s;everity, to expo&s;e &s;o eminent a Per&s;on, who <MILESTONE N="50"> knew all their Intrigues, upon the importunity of u&s;ele&s;s and incon&s;i|derable Per&s;ons, to infamy; whil&s;t others con&s;ider'd it, as a judgement of Heaven upon a Man who had been &s;o forward in promoting the
<PB N="316" REF="3630">
publick Calamities: and no doubt, it increa&s;ed much the Factions and Animo&s;ities, both in the Parliament, and the Army; and might have done them farther mi&s;chief, if it had not fallen on a Man &s;o throughly engaged, that no Provocations could make him le&s;s of their Party, or le&s;s concern'd in their Confederacy.</P>
<P>AT this time, nothing troubled the King &s;o much, as the Intelli|gence he receiv'd from <HI>Scotland,</HI> that they had already formed their Ar|my, and re&s;olv'd to enter <HI>England</HI> in the Winter Sea&s;on. All his confi|dence, which he had founded there upon the Faith, and mo&s;t &s;olemn Profe&s;&s;ions of particular Men, without whom the Nation could not have <MILESTONE N="10"> been corrupted, had deceiv'd him to a Man; and he found the &s;ame Men mo&s;t engaged again&s;t him, who had, with mo&s;t &s;olemnity, vowed all obedience to him. The circum&s;tance of the time made the danger of the Inva&s;ion the more formidable; for the Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> late|ly created a Marquis, had been compelled with his Army, as much by the murmurs and indi&s;po&s;ition of the Officers, as by the Sea&s;on of the Year, to quit his de&s;ign upon <HI>Hull,</HI> and to retire to <HI>York;</HI> and the Gar|ri&s;on of <HI>Hull</HI> had made many &s;trong infalls into the Country, and De|feated &s;ome of his Troops; &s;o that the <HI>Scots</HI> were like to find a &s;trong Party in that large County. However, the Marquis &s;ent a good Body <MILESTONE N="20"> of Hor&s;e towards the Borders, to wait their motion; and no &s;ooner heard of their march, which begun in <HI>January,</HI> in a great Fro&s;t and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scots <HI>en|ter</HI> England <HI>in</HI> Jan. 1643.</NOTE> Snow, than him&s;elf marched into the Bi&s;hoprick of <HI>Durham</HI> to attend them. The particulars of all that Affair, and the whole Tran&s;action of the Northern parts, where the Writer of this Hi&s;tory was never pre&s;ent, nor had any part in tho&s;e Coun&s;els, are fit for a relation apart; which a more proper Per&s;on will employ him&s;elf in.</P>
<P>IN the&s;e Streights, the King con&s;ider'd two Expedients which were propo&s;ed to him, and which his Maje&s;ty directed &s;hould be both con|&s;ulted in the Council. <Q>The one was, &startq;that all the Peers who were then <MILESTONE N="30"> in <HI>Oxford,</HI> or in the King's Service, might &s;ub&s;cribe a Letter to the Council of State in <HI>Scotland;</HI> whereby it would appear, by the &s;ub|&s;cription, that above five parts of &s;ix of the whole Nobility, and Hou&s;e of Peers, were in the King's Service, and di&s;avowed all tho&s;e Actions which were done again&s;t him, by the pretended Authority of the two Hou&s;es; which po&s;&s;ibly might make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion upon the Na|tion of <HI>Scotland,</HI> though it was well enough known before to their&endq; Seducers.</Q> <Q>A Letter was prepared accordingly, expre&s;&s;ing &startq;the foul|ne&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Letter from the Peers on the King's &s;ide to the Council in</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> of the Rebellion in <HI>England,</HI> under the reputation of the Hou&s;es of Parliament, and the carrying on the &s;ame, when they had driven <MILESTONE N="40"> away, by force, much the Major part of the Members of both Hou&s;es,&endq; and expre&s;sly again&s;t all the Laws of the Land:</Q> <Q>it put them in mind of &startq;&endq; their obligation to the King,</Q> <Q>and pathetically concluded &startq;with con|juring them to defi&s;t from their unju&s;t, and unwarrantable purpo&s;e; &s;ince they could have no excu&s;e for pro&s;ecuting the &s;ame, from the&endq; Authority of Parliament.</Q> The Letter was peru&s;ed, and debated in the Council, and afterwards in the pre&s;ence of all the Peers; and being ge|nerally approv'd, without any di&s;&s;enting Voice, it was order'd to be engro&s;&s;ed, and &s;igned by all tho&s;e Peers, and Privy Coun&s;ellors, who were then in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and to be &s;ent to tho&s;e who were ab&s;ent in any of the Ar|mies, or in the King's Quarters, and to be then &s;ent to the Marquis o$ <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> who, after he had &s;igned it, with tho&s;e Peers who were i$ tho&s;e parts, was to tran&s;mit it into <HI>Scotland</HI> by a Trumpet; all which was done accordingly.</P>

OF all the Peers who followed the King, there was only one who re|fu&s;ed to &s;ign this Letter, the Earl of <HI>Leice&s;ter;</HI> who, after many pau&s;es and delays, whether he had not yet di&s;ge&s;ted his late depo&s;al from the Lieutenancy of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to which the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> was deputed, and thought the di&s;obligation of it not capable of a reparation, or whe|ther he thought the King's Fortune de&s;perate, and re&s;olv'd not to &s;acri|fice him&s;elf to any popular di&s;plea&s;ure, and not to provoke the Parlia|ment farther than by not concurring with them; or whether he had it then in his purpo&s;e to be found in their Quarters, as &s;hortly after he was, did in the end po&s;itively refu&s;e to &s;ub&s;cribe the Letter; and there|by <MILESTONE N="10"> was the occa&s;ion of a mi&s;chief he did not intend. For both their Maje&s;ties, in their &s;ecret purpo&s;e, had de&s;ign'd him to &s;ucceed the Mar|quis of <HI>Hertford</HI> in the Government of the Prince; for which he would have been very proper; but upon this &s;o affected a di&s;covery of a na|ture, and mind, liable to no kind of compliance, the King could not pro|&s;ecute his purpo&s;e; and &s;o the Government of that hopeful and excel|lent Prince, was committed to the Earl of <HI>Berk-&s;hire,</HI> for no other rea|&s;on but becau&s;e he had a mind to it, and his importunity was very trou|ble&s;ome: a Man of any who bore the Name of a Gentleman, the mo&s;t unfit for That Province, or any other that required any proportion of <MILESTONE N="20"> Wi&s;dom and Under&s;tanding for the di&s;charge of it.</P>
<P>BUT it was the unhappy di&s;temper of the Court at that time, to think that it was no matter Who was employed in that Office; for the King nor Queen were not at all deceiv'd, nor was the Earl le&s;s fit than they thought him to be; but they thought his want of parts (his Fide|lity there was no cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect) to be of little importance: <Q>and a Coun&s;ellor, much tru&s;ted, &s;peaking at that time with the Lord <HI>Jermyn,</HI> &startq;how a&s;toni&s;hing a thing it was to all the Nation, to &s;ee the Prince com|mitted&endq; to &s;uch a Governour,</Q> he &s;miled, according to his cu&s;tom, when he could not an&s;wer; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;it was of no moment, Who had the <MILESTONE N="30"> name and &s;tyle of Governour, &s;ince the King and Queen meant to be his Governour, and firmly re&s;olv'd that he &s;hould never be out of&endq; Their pre&s;ence, or of one of them:</Q> when, within little more than a year after, the King found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;ever the Prince from him&s;elf, and lived not to &s;ee him again: and his Maje&s;ty then found, and lamented, that he had deputed &s;uch a Governour over him.</P>
<P><Q>THE other Expedient propo&s;ed, was, &startq;that &s;ince the whole King|dom was mi&s;led by the reverence they had to Parliaments, and be|liev'd that the Laws and Liberties of the People, could not be other|wi&s;e pre&s;erved, than by their &s;ole Authority, and that it appear'd to <MILESTONE N="40"> be to no purpo&s;e to per&s;wade Men that what they did was again&s;t Law, when they were per&s;waded that their very doing it made it Lawful, it would be therefore nece&s;&s;ary, and could be only effectual, to con|vince them, that they who did tho&s;e mon&s;trous things, were not the Parliament, but a handful of de&s;perate Per&s;ons, who, by the help of the tumults rai&s;ed in the City of <HI>London,</HI> had driven away the Major part of the Parliament, and called them&s;elves the Parliament, whil&s;t they were, in truth, much the le&s;s, and the lea&s;t con&s;iderable part of it; which would appear manife&s;tly, if the King would i&s;&s;ue out a Procla|mation, to require all the Members who had left the Parliament at <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> to repair to <HI>Oxford,</HI> by &s;uch a day; where his Maje&s;ty would be willing to advi&s;e with them in matters of the greate&s;t im|portance, concerning the Peace, and Di&s;tractions of the Kingdom: by
<PB N="318" REF="3650">
this means, he might, in many things, &s;erve him&s;elf by their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and it would evidently appear by the number of both Hou&s;es, who&s;e names would be quickly known, and publi&s;hed, how few remained at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> who carried on the devouring War, &s;o grievous to the&endq; whole Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>THE King was at fir&s;t in &s;ome apprehen&s;ion, that &s;uch a conflux of Per&s;ons together of the Parliament, who would look to enjoy the Pri|viledges of it in their Debates, might, in&s;tead of doing him Service, do many things contrary to it, and exceedingly apprehended, that they would immediately enter upon &s;ome Treaty of Peace, which would <MILESTONE N="10"> have no effect; yet, whil&s;t it was in &s;u&s;pence, would hinder his prepa|ration for the War; and though no body more de&s;ired Peace, yet he had no mind, that a Multitude &s;hould be con&s;ulted upon the conditions of it: imagining, that things of the greate&s;t importance, as the giving up Per&s;ons, and other particulars of Honour, would not &s;eem to them of moment enough to continue a War in the Kingdom; which would have been true, if, as hath been &s;aid before, the Governours of the Par|liament had not them&s;elves been too fearful of a Peace, to tru&s;t any to make politick Propo&s;itions, which, upon refu&s;al, might have done good, but being con&s;ented to had undone them, and fru&s;trated all their de|&s;igns. <MILESTONE N="$0"></P>
<P><Q>THE Council &s;eem'd much inclined to the Expedient, and many con|veniences were in View; and it might be rea&s;onably hoped, and pre|&s;umed &startq;that Per&s;ons, who had that Duty to obey his Maje&s;ties &s;um|mons, in coming thither, which would be none but &s;uch as had all|ready ab&s;ented them&s;elves from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and thereby incen&s;ed tho&s;e who remained there, would not bring ill and trouble&s;ome hu|mours with them, to di&s;turb that Service which could only pre&s;erve them: but on the contrary, would unite, and con&s;pire together, to make the King Superior to His and Their Enemies. And as to the ad|vancing <MILESTONE N="30"> any Propo&s;itions of Peace, which there could be no doubt but they would be inclined to, nor would it be fit for his Maje&s;ty to oppo&s;e, there could be no inconvenience; &s;ince their appearing in it would but draw reproach from tho&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> who would never give them any An&s;wer, or look upon them under any Notion, but as private Per&s;ons, and De&s;erters of the Parliament, without any Quali|fication to Treat, or to be Treated with: which would more provoke tho&s;e at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and, by degrees, &s;tir up more Animo&s;ities between&endq; them.</Q> The King di&s;cover'd more of hope than fear from &s;uch a Con|vention; and &s;o, with a very unanimous Con&s;ent and Approbation, a <MILESTONE N="$0"> Proclamation was i&s;&s;ued out, containing the true grounds and motives, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King's Proclamation for A&s;&s;embling the Members of Parliament at</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> and mentioning the League of <HI>Scotland</HI> to invade the Kingdom; which was the mo&s;t univer&s;ally odious, and dete&s;table; and &s;ummon'd all the Members of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, except only &s;uch, as, having Command in his Maje&s;ties Armies in the North, and in the We&s;t, could not be di&s;pen&s;ed with, to be ab&s;ent from their Charges, to attend upon his Maje&s;ty in <HI>Oxford,</HI> upon a day fixed in <HI>January</HI> next.</P>
<P>THE King was not all this while without a due &s;en&s;e of the dangers that threaten'd him in the growth, and improvement of the power and &s;trength of the Enemy, and how impo&s;&s;ible it would be for him, with|out &s;ome more extraordinary a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to re&s;i&s;t that Torrent, which, he fore&s;aw, by the next Spring, would be ready to overwhelm him, if he made not provi&s;ion accordingly. And finding, by degrees, that it was
<PB N="319" REF="3660">
not in his power to compo&s;e the di&s;turbances of <HI>England,</HI> or to prevent tho&s;e of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and abhorring the thought of introducing a Forreign Nation to &s;ubdue his own Subjects, he begun to think of Expedients which might allay the di&s;tempers in <HI>Ireland;</HI> that &s;o, having one of his Kingdoms in Peace, he might apply the Power of that, towards the pro|curing it in his other Dominions. He was not ignorant, how tender an Argument that bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland</HI> was, and how prepared Men were to pervert what&s;oever he &s;aid, or did in it; and therefore he re&s;olv'd to proceed with that caution, that what&s;oever was done in it, &s;hould be by the Coun&s;el of that State, who were under&s;tood to be mo&s;t skilful in <MILESTONE N="10"> tho&s;e Affairs.</P>
<P>THE Lords Ju&s;tices, and Council, had &s;ent a &s;hort Petition to his Maje&s;ty, which was pre&s;ented to them, in the name of his Catholick Subjects, then in Armes again&s;t him; <Q>by which they only de&s;ired, with full expre&s;&s;ions of Duty, and Submi&s;&s;ion to his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that he would appoint &s;ome Per&s;ons to hear what they could &s;ay for them&s;elves;&endq; and to pre&s;ent the &s;ame to his Maje&s;ty.</Q> Hereupon the King Autho|ri&s;ed by his Commi&s;&s;ion the Lord Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and &s;ome others, to receive what they were ready to offer, but without the lea&s;t Autho|rity to conclude any thing with them upon it. And after the receipt of <MILESTONE N="20"> this Commi&s;&s;ion, the Marquis, finding that this Petition was pro&s;ecuted with le&s;s ingenuity than it &s;eem'd to have been pre&s;ented, was &s;o far from being indulgent to them under that Notion, that he even then ad|vanced again&s;t them with his Army, and gave them a very &s;ignal Defeat; which reform'd their application, and made it more &s;ubmi&s;s.</P>
<P>IN the mean time (though in all Actions and Coun&s;els, the Lords Ju&s;tices, and Council there, had yeilded punctual obedience to all di|rections from the Parliament) the Affairs of that Kingdom &s;uffer'd ex|ceedingly for want of Provi&s;ions, Money, and Ammunition, out of <HI>England;</HI> which the two Hou&s;es of Parliament were obliged, and were, <MILESTONE N="30"> to that purpo&s;e, enabled by his Maje&s;ty to &s;end. <Q>In&s;omuch as that Board, by their Letters of the fourth of <HI>April,</HI> this pre&s;ent year, adverti&s;ed the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, &startq;that they had been compelled, for the pre&s;ervation of the Army, to take Money from all who had it, and to wre&s;t their Commodities from the poor Merchants, whom they had now, by the Law of nece&s;&s;ity, utterly undone, and di&s;abled from being hereafter helpful to them, in bringing them in Victuals, or other needful Commodities: And that there were few of them&s;elves, or others, that had not felt their parts in the inforced rigour of their pro|ceedings, &s;o as, what with &s;uch hard dealing, no le&s;s grievous to Them <MILESTONE N="40"> to do, than it was heavy to Others to &s;uffer, and by their de&s;cending, again&s;t their hearts, far below the Honour and Dignity of that Power they repre&s;ented under his Royal Maje&s;ty, they had, with un&s;peakable difficulties, prevailed &s;o as to be able to find bread for the Soldiers for the &s;pace of one Month: That they were then expelling thence all Strangers, and mu&s;t in&s;tantly &s;end away for <HI>England</HI> thou&s;ands of poor di&s;poil'd <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who&s;e very eating was now in&s;upportable to that place; and therefore, they &s;aid, they did again earne&s;tly, and finally de&s;ire (for their confu&s;ions would not now admit the writing of many more Letters, if any) &s;ome Supplies of Victual and Munition might, <MILESTONE N="50"> in pre&s;ent, be ha&s;ten'd thither to keep life, until the re&s;t might follow; there being no Victuals in &s;tore; nor one hundred Barrels of Powder; which, according to the u&s;ual nece&s;&s;ary Expences, be&s;ides extraordinary&endq; Accidents, would not la&s;t above a Month.</Q></P>

A COPY of this Letter they likewi&s;e &s;ent to M^r Secretary <HI>Nicholas,</HI> that his Maje&s;ty might be inform'd of the &s;adne&s;s of their condition, and, with it, a Copy of a paper that morning pre&s;ented to the Board (which was likewi&s;e &s;ent in their Letter to the Speaker) from the Officers of the Army; <Q>who, after &s;harp expre&s;&s;ions of the mi&s;eries they &s;u&s;tain'd, and expo&s;tulations thereupon, concluded, &startq;that if their Lord&s;hips would take them into their timely con&s;iderations, before their urgent wants made them de&s;perate, they would &s;erve them readily and faithfully; but if their Lord&s;hips would not find a way for their pre&s;ervations there, they humbly de&s;ired they might have leave to go where they might have a better being; and if they refu&s;ed to grant That, they <MILESTONE N="10"> them&s;elves mu&s;t then take leave to have recour&s;e to that fir&s;t and pri|mary Law, which God had endued all Men with, the Law of Nature,&endq; which taught all Men to pre&s;erve them&s;elves.</Q></P>
<P>THE King was exceedingly perplexed at the receipt of this Adver|ti&s;ement; apprehending the State of his Prote&s;tant Subjects in that Kingdom to be allmo&s;t de&s;perate, the Rebels receiving daily encourage|ment and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from Forreign parts; and thereupon growing &s;trong and bold; yet he forbore to interpo&s;e his own Soveraign Power, hoping this la&s;t clear repre&s;entation would have made &s;o deep an impre&s;&s;ion in the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, that they would have &s;ent &s;uch a full <MILESTONE N="20"> Supply, that at lea&s;t the Rebels might make no farther Progre&s;s in Vi|ctory, again&s;t his Prote&s;tant Subjects. About the end of <HI>May,</HI> the Lords Ju&s;tices and Council, having receiv'd no probable hope of A&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Parliament, &s;ent an Addre&s;s immediately to his Maje&s;ty, that Him|&s;elf might conclude, in that exigent, what was to be done for pre&s;erva|tion of one of his three Kingdoms. This Letter, Sub&s;cribed by the Lords Ju&s;tices, and every Member of the Council-Board, being the ground and foundation of the Re&s;olutions which his Maje&s;ty afterwards took, I think nece&s;&s;ary to in&s;ert in the terms of which it con&s;i&s;ted; which <MILESTONE N="30"> were the&s;e:</P>

The King well fore&s;aw to what reproaches he &s;hould object him&s;elf, by <MILESTONE N="20"> entering into &s;uch a Treaty with tho&s;e Rebels; and that they who had per&s;waded many to believe, that he had given countenance to, if not fomented the Rebellion, again&s;t all humane Evidence that can be ima|gin'd, would more ea&s;ily gain credit, when they &s;hould be able to &s;ay, that he had made a Peace with them: Be&s;ides that he had bound him|&s;elf not to make a Peace with the Rebels in <HI>Ireland,</HI> without the con|&s;ent of his two Hou&s;es of Parliament in <HI>England.</HI> On the other &s;ide, nothing was more demon&s;trable, than that his Prote&s;tant Subjects there, could not defend the little they had left, without extraordinary aid and <MILESTONE N="$0"> a&s;&s;i&s;tance out of <HI>England;</HI> that it was impo&s;&s;ible for him to &s;end any to them, and as vi&s;ible, that the Parliament Would not, or Could not; &s;o that it &s;eem'd only in his Election, whether he would pre&s;erve the remainder of his Prote&s;tant Subjects there, and that whole Kingdom, in dependence upon his Crown, with the inconvenience of &s;ome per|ver&s;e and unrea&s;onable &s;candal; or &s;uffer them to be rooted out; and undergo the perpetual obloquy of having lo&s;t a Kingdom, when it was in his own power to have retained it within his Subjection: and what|ever he had obliged him&s;elf to, in tho&s;e Acts of Parliament which he had pa&s;&s;ed for relief of <HI>Ireland,</HI> before any Rebellion in <HI>England,</HI> was <MILESTONE N="$0"> not, that there might never be a Peace in <HI>Ireland,</HI> but that the two Hou&s;es might cooperate with him, whereby the Rebels might be re|duced to tho&s;e Streights, that they might be compelled to &s;ubmit to the performance of their Duties: and that, in&s;tead of any &s;uch coopera|tion, the two Hou&s;es refu&s;ed to concur with him in any thing, and had employed tho&s;e Monies, which had been rai&s;ed by tho&s;e very Acts, for the relief of <HI>Ireland,</HI> in the maintenance of the Armies which had given his Maje&s;ty Battle in <HI>England,</HI> expre&s;sly contrary to the words of tho&s;e Acts; and therefore that his Maje&s;ty might be rea&s;onably di&s;engaged from tho&s;e Covenants on His part.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e con&s;iderations, after two Months delay, to &s;ee whethe$ yet the Parliament would take care of them, and having receiv'd fre&s;$ importunities, and advices from thence, about the end of <HI>July,</HI> the Kin$

<P><Q>&startq;THE Lords and Commons in Parliament, have Commanded Us <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Letter con|cerning it, from the two Hou&s;es to the Lords Ju&s;tices</HI> July 4. 1643.</NOTE> to let you know, they have &s;een your Letter of the tenth of <HI>June,</HI> di|rected to the Speaker of the Hou&s;e of Commons, accompanied with an Act of State, in the Preamble whereof is an expre&s;&s;ion to this effect, that your pre&s;ent difficulties are occa&s;ioned through the failure of the Hou&s;es of Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> who undertook the charge of this War. This Letter, and Act of Council, were &s;ent by his Maje&s;ty from <HI>Oxford;</HI> to whom they believe you have &s;ent Copies of both, and have ju&s;t cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect, that there is an impious de&s;ign now on foot, <MILESTONE N="30"> to fell for nought the crying Blood of many hundred thou&s;ands of <HI>Briti&s;h</HI> Prote&s;tants, by a di&s;honourable, un&s;ufferable Peace with the Rebels; and then to lay the blame and &s;hame of this, upon the Par|liament; a Plot &s;uitable to tho&s;e Coun&s;els that have both projected, and fomented this unparallel'd Rebellion: for tho&s;e who contrived the Powder Trea&s;on, intended to lay it on the Puritans. And although they cannot think your Lord&s;hips intended to further this de&s;ign by this expre&s;&s;ion, yet they have cau&s;e to believe, you have forgotten the pre&s;ent condition of this Kingdom; the Supplies they have &s;ent <MILESTONE N="$0"> thither of all &s;orts, even in the mid&s;t of their own wants; what relief going thither hath been taken away by Sea, and Land, and by whom; and what di&s;couragements have been given them in return: &s;o that, as your Lord&s;hips do truly ob&s;erve the Prote&s;tant Party in that City de&s;irous to contribute, in all things, towards pre&s;ervation of that King|dom, and that all the oppo&s;ition therein is from tho&s;e of the Popi&s;h Party, &s;o ought you ju&s;tly to conclude, that the Prote&s;tant Party in this Kingdom have contributed, and are &s;till endeavouring to contri|bute, Monies, Ammunition, Victuals, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, for the &s;aving of that Kingdom: And that the Popi&s;h, and Malignant Party here, now in Armes again&s;t the Parliament and Kingdom, have not a&s;&s;i&s;ted, in the lea&s;t mea&s;ure, this pious work; but, on the contrary, do hinder, and oppo&s;e the &s;ame: Neither &s;hould your Lord&s;hips conceive,

that only the charge of that War was referr'd to, and undertaken by the Parliament, as if Their part was to be Your Bankers, only to pro|vide Money for You to &s;pend, and were not to advi&s;e and direct the managing of the War; although an Act of Parliament hath inve&s;ted them with that Power; which they mu&s;t a&s;&s;ume and vindicate as the means to &s;ave that Kingdom; and &s;hall bring to condigne puni&s;hment tho&s;e there, who, in this conjuncture of Affairs, have advi&s;ed the Com|mi&s;&s;ion to hear what the Rebels can &s;ay, or propound, for their own Advantage; the Letters to dive&s;t their Committee of an Authority given them by both Hou&s;es; and that advi&s;ed the late alteration of Government there; as Enemies to the Weale of both Kingdoms, and <MILESTONE N="10"> Fautors of that Rebellion.

<PB N="326" REF="3730">
from peri&s;hing by Famine, it became nece&s;&s;ary to expre&s;s, in the Act of Council whereby We order'd it, the rea&s;ons inducing Us to &s;et on foot here a thing &s;o unknown to his Maje&s;ties Laws, and gracious Go|vernment, and the difficulties wherewith We contended, which did nece&s;&s;itate that re&s;olution; and in expre&s;&s;ing tho&s;e difficulties, We u&s;ed that expre&s;&s;ion, to &s;hew whence our difficulties were occa&s;ion'd; and that We have therein declared the truth, We crave leave to mind&endq; you of &s;ome particulars.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;IF We &s;hould look &s;o far back as to repeat the Sub&s;tance of many di&s;patches &s;ent from this Board, &s;ince the beginning of this Rebellion; &s;ome, to our very good Lord, the Lord Lieutenant of this Kingdom; <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;ome to the Lords, and others, Members of both Hou&s;es, his Ma|je&s;ties Commi&s;&s;ioners for the Affairs of this Kingdom; and &s;ome, to the Speaker of the Commons Hou&s;e of Parliament there; it would prove a voluminous work; and therefore We forbear to look farther back into tho&s;e di&s;patches, than to the time when the Committee &s;ent thence hither, were here; who, at their Arrival here, in the end of <HI>October</HI> 1642, brought with them &s;ome Money and Provi&s;ions, but far &s;hort of that, which the Nece&s;&s;ities of this Army required; and indeed &s;o incon&s;iderable, in re&s;pect of tho&s;e Nece&s;&s;ities, as even before that Committee departed, they &s;aw the Money they had brought, whole|ly <MILESTONE N="20"> i&s;&s;ued; and the high and unavoidable nece&s;&s;ity of a farther, &s;peedy, and plentiful &s;upply of Money, and other Provi&s;ions. By Letters from this Board of the 20^t^h of <HI>January</HI> 1642, and directed to the Speaker of the Commons Hou&s;e of Parliament there, it was &s;ignified thither, that the Provi&s;ions of Victuals here, were then at the very bottom; that that Committee then here, had certified thither tho&s;e Wants; that if a per&s;onal &s;upply of Victual arrived not here very &s;peedily, the Army could not &s;ub&s;i&s;t, but mu&s;t have been con&s;train'd to disband, to the lo&s;s of this Kingdom, and utter de&s;truction of the few Subjects here: that the want of Trea&s;ure here, to pay the Army, enforced this Board <MILESTONE N="30"> to i&s;&s;ue Victual to the Common Soldier, and others, towards their pay, which did the &s;ooner exhau&s;t the Magazine of Victual; that the Cap|tains, and other Officers, not having relief that way, were reduced to great extremities, as had been formerly often repre&s;ented thither; and therefore this Board, by the &s;aid Letters, then moved, that Trea|&s;ure might be &s;ent us &s;peedily, &s;o to redeem the Officers from the Ca|lamities they &s;uffer'd, and this Board from their un&s;upportable Cla|mours; and to enable the payment, in &s;ome part, in Money to the Common Soldier; &s;o to make the Victual We then expected, to hold&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> out the longer.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;IT was al&s;o by tho&s;e Letters then adverti&s;ed thither, that the ex|tremities of the Officers of the Army had begotten &s;o much di&s;content among&s;t them, as divers Colonels, and others of them, pre&s;ented at this Board a Remon&s;trance, whereof a Copy was then &s;ent inclo&s;ed in the &s;aid Letters; which Remon&s;trance did exceedingly trouble, and perplex Us, le&s;t it might beget &s;uch di&s;tractions among&s;t Us, as might give too much advantage to the Rebels. But, after full Debate thereof at this Board, it was here directed, that in pre&s;ent, to render &s;ome Sub&s;i&s;tence to the Officers, until Trea&s;ure arrived forth of <HI>England,</HI> every Man in this City &s;hould bring in half of his Plate, to be paid for it when Trea&s;ure arrived; whereupon &s;ome Plate was brought in, and applied towards the Army.

<PB N="327" REF="3740">
Letters, that without &s;ome &s;peedy relief forth of <HI>England,</HI> the Bur|then here was become too heavy to be borne; and therefore, in di&s;|charge of our Duty to God, to our Gracious Soveraign, to that King|dom, and to This, We held our &s;elves bound clearly to make known, that unle&s;s We were &s;peedily &s;upplied from thence, with Money, Armes, and Victual, it would be impo&s;&s;ible for Us any farther to pro|&s;ecute this War, or to pre&s;erve from &s;uddain confu&s;ion this State and Government: &s;o highly did the di&s;content of the Officers, and the di&s;|order of the Soldiers, threaten Us, that it might be ea&s;ily apprehended, what, in all humane probability, mu&s;t become of Us, when it was then evident, that here was no Money, nor any po&s;&s;ibility of procuring <MILESTONE N="10"> any in this City; when our Victuals were &s;pent; when a great part of the Army had no Armes; upon which We doubted, and feared, for the rea&s;ons in tho&s;e Letters expre&s;s'd, that the Soldiers would make Prey of Us and this City at la&s;t; and when We &s;aw that the de&s;truction, then threaten'd again&s;t Us, mu&s;t then go farther, even to the lo&s;s of this Crown, and Kingdom; and to the highly endangering of that King|dom al&s;o; which, for the Honour of his Maje&s;ty, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Na|tion, We by our &s;aid Letters de&s;ired might, by the Wi&s;dom of that Honourable Hou&s;e, be &s;peedily prevented, by ha&s;tening away, with&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed, Supply of Money, Armes, and Victuals.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;BY other Letters of this Board, directed to M^r Speaker, and dated the &s;aid twentieth of <HI>January</HI> 1642, it was adverti&s;ed thither, that it was become of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity, that there &s;hould be &s;ent Us from thence, &s;peedily, &s;ix hundred light Geldings for Recruits, to be de|faulked out of the entertainments of tho&s;e who &s;hould receive them. By other Letters from this Board, of the &s;ame date, directed to M^r Speaker, it was &s;ignified thither, that We had contracted an Agreement herewith <HI>Theodore Schout,</HI> and <HI>Jacob Ablin,</HI> Merchants, that <HI>Anthony Tyrenes,</HI> in <HI>London,</HI> or <HI>Daniel Wibrant,</HI> in <HI>Am&s;terdam,</HI> &s;hould re|ceive <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;even thou&s;and eight hundred four&s;core and thirteen pounds three &s;hillings; for which the &s;aid <HI>Theodore</HI> and <HI>Jacob,</HI> had undertaken, by their agreement with Us, to buy in <HI>Holland,</HI> and to Tran&s;port from thence hither, at their own charge and adventure, &s;everal pro|portions of Armes mention'd in a Docquet, then &s;ent inclo&s;ed in our &s;aid Letters; and they undertook &s;o to &s;ecure it by in&s;urance, and provide &s;uch a Ship of force, as We might be a&s;&s;ured to have all tho&s;e Armes arrive here by the tenth of <HI>March</HI> now la&s;t pa&s;t. And We, by our &s;aid Letters, earne&s;tly be&s;ought that the &s;aid Sum of &s;even thou|&s;and eight hundred four&s;core and thirteen pounds three &s;hillings might, <MILESTONE N="40"> by order of that Honourable Hou&s;e, be &s;peedily paid to the &s;aid <HI>Tyrenes,</HI> or <HI>Wibrant,</HI> that tho&s;e Provi&s;ions might arrive here by the tenth of <HI>March;</HI> that we might not lo&s;e the advantage of the then next Spring, for recovering of &s;uch of the Sea Ports, and other places of impor|tance, as the Rebels had gotten; and for proceeding effectually in this War. Tho&s;e Letters al&s;o moved for other provi&s;ions of War, which We conceiv'd might be had in <HI>England</HI> in rea&s;onable time. And We then &s;ent a Docquet of tho&s;e al&s;o; de&s;iring earne&s;tly they might be &s;ent us &s;peedily. And although there was an Agent &s;ent from hence in <HI>November</HI> 1641, to &s;ollicite the di&s;patches &s;ent from hence, who <MILESTONE N="$0"> attended at <HI>London,</HI> when tho&s;e our Letters were &s;ent hence; yet of &s;o great importance was that di&s;patch, requiring in&s;tant and &s;peedy An&s;wer and &s;upply from thence, as We adjudged it nece&s;&s;ary to give

&s;pecial In&s;tructions to the Lord <HI>Conway,</HI> and others (be&s;ides that Agent then there attending) to move his Maje&s;ty, and &s;ollicite the Hou&s;es of Parliament, to ha&s;ten unto Us, with all po&s;&s;ible Speed, the Provi&s;ions in tho&s;e Letters contain'd: And that there might nothing be omitted, that by &s;ollicitation could be obtain'd, there were Agents al&s;o &s;ent thither from the Army to &s;ollicite for them. By Letters from this Board of the twentieth of <HI>February</HI> 1642, directed to M^r Speaker, We again de&s;ired, with all po&s;&s;ible earne&s;tne&s;s, that the Provi&s;ions of all &s;orts, expre&s;&s;ed in tho&s;e three Letters of the twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> and the Docquets therewith &s;ent, might be ha&s;ten'd to Us; and that the &s;aid &s;even thou&s;and eight hundred four&s;core and thirteen pounds <MILESTONE N="10"> three &s;hillings, for Armes to be provided in <HI>Holland,</HI> might be &s;peedily paid. And in tho&s;e la&s;t Letters We again &s;ignified our mi&s;erable, and un&s;peakable want of Victuals, Armes, Munition, Money, Shooes, and other Nece&s;&s;aries; and that if the Supplies We moved for, came not &s;peedily, We were unavoidably in danger, to be as much devour'd by our own wants, as by the Sword of the Rebels; and that our want of Corn was &s;o much the more, in regard that, in confidence to be plen|tifully &s;upplied forth of <HI>England,</HI> We cau&s;ed great de&s;truction to be made of Corn; there being indeed nothing conducing more to the de|&s;truction&endq; of Rebels, than the burning of all Corn.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P><Q>&startq;WE al&s;o then &s;ignified the nece&s;&s;ity of &s;ending a farther &s;upply of Powder, and Match; and We declared, that no words could &s;ufficient|ly expre&s;s the greatne&s;s of the danger We &s;hould incur, if our Sup|plies came not &s;peedily: that the Plate brought in, amounted not to one thou&s;and two hundred pounds; a Sum very incon&s;iderable towards relief of the Officers. By Letters of this Board of the 25^t^h of <HI>February</HI> 1642, directed to M^r Speaker, We &s;ignified, that when our means from thence failed, and our credits could hold out no longer, We were con|&s;train'd, towards relief of the Army, to force from the Prote&s;tant Mer|chants <MILESTONE N="10"> here, as well <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> as Strangers, not only the Commodities they had brought hither, but the Native Commodities al&s;o; under|taking to them that they &s;hould receive Payment at <HI>London;</HI> which failing, that tho&s;e that would &s;upply Us, were di&s;hearten'd, and dur&s;t not come hither with Commodities; wherefore We again, by tho&s;e Letters, be&s;ought &s;peedy &s;upply from thence; declaring that other|wi&s;e, the Army, and We, mu&s;t peri&s;h; and &s;o far We were tran&s;ported with grief, in the con&s;ideration of the high extremities of this. King|dom, and Army, as We did, by tho&s;e Letters, lament for the &s;hame and di&s;honour, which We then fore&s;aw would reflect upon the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, if then, after &s;o long and often forewarnings, given by Us to that Honourable Hou&s;e, this Kingdom were lo&s;t, and that for want of Supplies from thence; wherein We then declared, that all the com|fort left Us, was, that We had done Our parts, and di&s;charged our du|ties to God, to his Maje&s;ty, and to all his Kingdoms, who mu&s;t have&endq; borne their parts with Us in &s;o heavy a lo&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;BY Letters from this Board dated the 23^d of <HI>March</HI> 1642, directed to M^r Speaker, We &s;ignified that our wants enforced Us to di&s;tribute the Soldiers, for their Victuals, in and throughout this City and Suburbs; which, We &s;ignified, could not long hold, con&s;idering the <MILESTONE N="$0"> poverty of this place; and therefore, to avoid utter confu&s;ion, We did again and again be&s;eech mo&s;t earne&s;tly, that, above all things, Victuals and Munition might be &s;ent Us &s;peedily; and that Money, Armes,

Cloaths, Shooes, and other Provi&s;ions might al&s;o be &s;ent; declaring, that if they yet came &s;peedily, the Kingdom, and his Maje&s;ties Forces here, might be thereby redeem'd out of part of their di&s;tre&s;&s;es; and We enabled, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, to give his Maje&s;ty &s;uch an ac|count of this Kingdom, as would be for the Glory of the King our Ma&s;ter, and the Honour of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, in the &s;ubduing this horrid Rebellion; which, by rea&s;on of our wants, and in no other re|&s;pect, was then grown very terrible: and We did again call for the Pro|vi&s;ions, moved for by our &s;everal former Letters of the twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> and twentieth of <HI>February,</HI> and for the payment of the &s;even thou&s;and eight hundred four&s;core and thirteen pounds three &s;hillings, <MILESTONE N="10"> for Armes to be provided in <HI>Holland,</HI> and tho&s;e al&s;o which We expect from <HI>London;</HI> declaring, that unle&s;s tho&s;e Supplies came, We &s;hould be di&s;abled from doing Service on the Rebels the then next Spring, or the then &s;ucceeding Summer; and mu&s;t undoubtedly put the Rebels into a condition of prevailing again&s;t us, which We well believ'd, the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> would never have permitted again&s;t &s;o faithful&endq; Servants and valiant Soldiers, as his Maje&s;ty yet had here.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;BY tho&s;e Letters al&s;o we &s;ignified, that it was nece&s;&s;ary that there &s;hould be here, at this Harbour of <HI>Dublin,</HI> by the middle of <HI>April,</HI> at <MILESTONE N="20"> lea&s;t two Ships of good Strength; and that the Ships de&s;ign'd for guarding the other parts of the Coa&s;ts of this Kingdom, &s;hould be ha&s;ten'd away with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed. By Letters from this Board di|rected to M^r Speaker, dated the fourth of <HI>April</HI> 1643, We repre&s;ented again the un&s;peakable mi&s;eries of the Officers and Soldiers, for want of all things; and all tho&s;e made the more in&s;upportable, in the want of food; and that this City was then apparently found to be unable to help Us, as it had formerly done; and repeated again, in as lively terms as we could, the high extremities fallen, and encrea&s;ing upon Us; declaring, that We were enforced to &s;ee, who had any thing yet <MILESTONE N="$0"> left him not taken from him, to help Us; and that although there were but few &s;uch, and &s;ome poor Merchants, whom We had for|merly, by the Law of nece&s;&s;ity, utterly undone; yet, that We were forced to wre&s;t their Commodities from them: That there were few here, of our &s;elves or others, that had not felt their parts in the in|forced rigour of our proceedings towards pre&s;erving the Army; and We earne&s;tly de&s;ired, that his Maje&s;ty, and the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation, might not &s;uffer &s;o great, if not irrecoverable prejudice and di&s;honour, as mu&s;t unavoidably be the con&s;equence of our not being reliev'd &s;ud|dainly; but that Yet, although it were then even allmo&s;t at the point <MILESTONE N="$0"> to be too late, Supplies of Victuals, and Munition, in pre&s;ent might be ha&s;ten'd hither, to keep life, until the re&s;t might follow: declaring al&s;o, that there was no Victual in the Store, and that there would not be an hundred Barrels of Powder left, when the out Garri&s;ons, as they mu&s;t then in&s;tantly have been, were &s;upplied; and that the re&s;idue of our Provi&s;ions mu&s;t al&s;o come &s;peedily after, or otherwi&s;e that <HI>England</HI> could not hope to &s;ecure <HI>Ireland,</HI> or &s;ecure Them&s;elves again&s;t <HI>Ireland;</HI> but in the lo&s;s of it, mu&s;t look for &s;uch Enemies from hence, as would perpetually di&s;turb the Peace of his Maje&s;ty, and his Kingdom of <HI>England;</HI> and among them, by Sea and Land, as We had often for|merly repre&s;ented thither; which mi&s;chiefs We &s;ignified might yet be prevented, if We were but then forthwith enabled from thence, with&endq; means to overcome this Rebellion.</Q></P>

&startq;WE then al&s;o again renewed our reque&s;ts for the Provi&s;ions, men|tion'd in our Letters of the twentieth of <HI>January,</HI> and for the pay|ment of the &s;even thou&s;and eight hundred four&s;core and thirteen pounds three &s;hillings, for Armes to be provided in <HI>Holland,</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e we expected from <HI>London:</HI> We then al&s;o &s;ent, inclo&s;ed in our Letters to M^r Speaker, a Copy of writing, &s;ign'd by &s;undry Officers of the Army, which was in a Style threatning much danger; whereby appear'd the high nece&s;&s;ity of ha&s;tning Trea&s;ure hither to pay them, and the re&s;t of the Officers, and provide Victual for the Soldiers. On the 10^t^h of <HI>April</HI> 1643, We receiv'd Letters from M^r Speaker, of the 17^t^h of <HI>March,</HI> in An&s;wer to our Letters of the 20^t^h and 25^t^h of <HI>Fe|bruary.</HI> <MILESTONE N="$0"> Tho&s;e Letters from M^r Speaker, advi&s;ed free Trade and Truck to be given to Merchants, by taking our Native Commodities, that cannot be manufactur'd here, for their Corn, and other Victuals, and carrying them into <HI>England,</HI> or other places not prohibited.

By our Letters to M^r Speaker of the 11^t^h of <HI>May</HI> 1643, We &s;ignified, that although by Letters from M^r Speaker dated the 17^t^h day of <HI>March,</HI> it was adverti&s;ed hither, that &s;ix weeks Provi&s;ion of Victuals, for each Province, was in preparing, yet that it was not come, or if it was come, that it was a Supply far below that which was nece&s;&s;ary to be then &s;ent hither. And We then again repeated the mi&s;erable condi|tion of this Army, through want of all things, e&s;pecially Money, Victuals, Cloaths, Armes, and Munition: that there was not above forty Barrels of Powder in the Store (a mean and incon&s;iderable quan|tity for this Army, on whom depends the pre&s;ervation of the King|dom) and We again de&s;ired, in ca&s;e of &s;o high and eminent danger, and that with all po&s;&s;ible importunity, that a cour&s;e might be then in|&s;tantly taken for ha&s;tning away Powder with all &s;peed, and that the other Provi&s;ions al&s;o of all &s;orts, mention'd in our former &s;everal Let|ters of the 20^t^h of <HI>January,</HI> 20^t^h, and 25^t^h of <HI>February,</HI> the 23^d of <HI>March,</HI> and the 4^t^h, and 22^d of <HI>April,</HI> might be al&s;o ha&s;ten'd away; and that the &s;even thou&s;and eight hundred and four&s;core and thirteen pounds three &s;hillings, for Armes to be provided in <HI>Holland,</HI> be&s;ides tho&s;e we&endq; expected from <HI>London,</HI> might be paid.</Q></P>

But We confe&s;s We know not, what relief coming hither hath been taken away, either by Sea or Land, or by whom, or what di&s;couragement hath been given them in return: Only We have heard, that the Shipping, employed by the Rebels at <HI>Wexford,</HI> did give them &s;ome interruption at Sea; and that was occa&s;ion'd by neglect of duty in tho&s;e who Commanded the Ships de&s;ign'd for the Guard of the Coa&s;ts of this Kingdom: And the &s;aid Ship bound hither from <HI>Holland</HI> with Munition, which We had contracted for here, was intercepted at Sea, and carried to <HI>Calais,</HI> and afterwards &s;et free there, by the mediation of his Maje&s;ty and the <MILESTONE N="10"> Hou&s;es of Parliament in <HI>England.</HI> And We find that &s;ome Ships, &s;ent hither it &s;eems at fir&s;t with Provi&s;ions from <HI>London,</HI> and other Ships bound hither with Provi&s;ions on private Mens Adventures, were taken away even from this Harbour, a few days before the Ce&s;&s;ation of Armes here, as they were coming in, and carried to <HI>Leverpool,</HI> by one Cap|tain <HI>Dausk,</HI> a Per&s;on employed by the two Hou&s;es of Parliament there, in the Command of a Ship, and that Ship Commanded by <HI>Dausk,</HI> and other Ships employed at <HI>Leverpool,</HI> do now, and have a long time &s;tay'd on that &s;ide, laden with Provi&s;ion of Victuals, Coales, and other nece&s;&s;ary relief bound from thence hither to be &s;old; which, if they had arrived here, would have brought great relief to this Army, and <MILESTONE N="20"> the Inhabitants in this City, though on the Adventure of the Bringers; which We hold nece&s;&s;ary to repre&s;ent thither, to the end that their uncharitablene&s;s towards tho&s;e poor Men that would Adventure hi|ther to relieve Us, and their inhumanity towards this di&s;tre&s;&s;ed Army, and City, and many of his Maje&s;ties Prote&s;tant Subjects therein, might appear &s;o, as they, or others, may not pre&s;ume hereafter to offend&endq; in that kind.</Q></P>

which, by occa&s;ion of this Rebellion, lay upon his loving Subjects of his Kingdom of <HI>England:</HI> We therefore, by our Letters of the &s;eventh of <HI>June</HI> 1642, directed to tho&s;e his Maje&s;ties Commi&s;&s;ioners, be&s;ought, among other things, pre&s;ent and particular direction for the pro&s;ecu|tion of the War; which yet We have not receiv'd: only We had ad|vice from thence, to &s;end &s;ome Forces into <HI>Connaught;</HI> which was done; and for &s;ending &s;ome Forces into <HI>Mun&s;ter,</HI> which, by Our Let|ters of the thirteenth of <HI>September</HI> 1642 to the Commi&s;&s;ioners there, We &s;ignified was not po&s;&s;ible for Us to do, unle&s;s We were plentifully &s;upplied of tho&s;e things, whereof the wants then certified thither did&endq; then di&s;able Us.</Q> <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P><Q>&startq;CONCERNING the Commi&s;&s;ion in your Letters mention'd, it was not to hear what the Rebels would &s;ay, or propound for their own ad|vantage, as your Letters mention; but his Maje&s;ty having receiv'd an humble Petition, in the name of the Recu&s;ants of <HI>Ireland,</HI> de&s;iring to be heard, his Maje&s;ty thought it not unju&s;t, or inconvenient for him, to receive from them what they could &s;ay unto him; to whom they in&s;inuated that they would yet yeild due obedience. And therefore his Maje&s;ty, by his Commi&s;&s;ion under the Great Seal of <HI>England</HI> (wherein he declared his extreme dete&s;tation of the odious Rebellion, which the <MILESTONE N="20"> Recu&s;ants of <HI>Ireland</HI> have, without any ground or colour, rai&s;ed again&s;t Him, his Crown, and Dignity) Authori&s;ed &s;ome of his Mini&s;ters here, to hear at large what the Petitioners &s;hould &s;ay, or propound; which his Maje&s;ty, by the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion, directed that the Petitioners, or the principal of them, Authori&s;ed by the re&s;t, &s;hould &s;et down in writing under their hands; and the Commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;end the &s;ame to his Ma|je&s;ty; whereupon his Maje&s;ty by the &s;aid Commi&s;&s;ion declared, he would take &s;uch farther con&s;ideration, as &s;hould be ju&s;t, honourable, and fit for his Maje&s;ty: And that that Cour&s;e gave not the lea&s;t interruption to the proceeding of the War, appears by this, that on the eighteenth of <HI>March</HI> (being in the time the Commi&s;&s;ioners, Authori&s;ed by his Maje&s;ty, gave meeting to tho&s;e of the other &s;ide, upon that Commi&s;|&s;ion) the Lord Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> though one of tho&s;e Commi&s;|&s;ioners, in his return from <HI>Ro&s;&s;e</HI> with about two thou&s;and five hun|dred Foot, and five hundred Hor&s;e of his Maje&s;ties Army, fought with the Army of the Rebels, con&s;i&s;ting of about &s;ix thou&s;and Foot, and &s;ix hundred and fifty Hor&s;e, and obtained a happy and glorious Vi|ctory again&s;t them; and the Rebel's Army being Defeated, and whole|ly Routed, and their Baggage and Munition &s;ei&s;ed on, his Maje&s;ties Forces lodged that night where they had gained the Victory, as by former Letters of this Board, of the fourth of <HI>April</HI> 1643, directed to M^r Speaker, We formerly &s;ignified thither: which We thus repeat, to manife&s;t that that Commi&s;&s;ion, or the Meeting thereupon, gave not&endq; any manner of interruption to the proceeding of the War.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;CONCERNING the Letters you mention, to deve&s;t the Committee of both Hou&s;es there of an Authority given them by both Hou&s;es, We remember that his Maje&s;ty, by his Letters of the third of <HI>Fe|bruary</HI> 1642, under&s;tanding that the then Ju&s;tices and Council had admitted, without His order or knowledge, to &s;it in Council with them in this his Kingdom, M^r <HI>Robert Goodwin</HI> and M^r <HI>Reynolds,</HI> and that thereby they were become &s;o bold, as to take upon them to hear, and debate of matters Treated of in Council, his Maje&s;ty, by his &s;aid Letters, &s;ignified by his expre&s;s Command, that they &s;hould not be
<PB N="336" REF="3830">
permitted to &s;it, or be pre&s;ent any more at his Maje&s;ties Council Table here; but if they had any bu&s;ine&s;s, his Maje&s;ty willed, that they &s;hould attend as others of their Quality: which his Maje&s;ties plea&s;ure was humbly obeyed by his &s;aid Ju&s;tices, and Council, with that Duty and Submi&s;&s;ion, which was due from them to his Royal Commands. And as his Maje&s;ty, by his &s;aid Letters required, that, if tho&s;e Per&s;ons had any bu&s;ine&s;s, they &s;hould attend, as others of their Quality; &s;o, if they had afterwards offer'd any bu&s;ine&s;s at this Board, they &s;hould have been heard therein; which was al&s;o &s;ignified to them before their de|parture hence. And now, upon this occa&s;ion, We having peru&s;ed the <MILESTONE N="10"> Copies they deliver'd at this Board, of the Order of both Hou&s;es dated the &s;ixth of <HI>October</HI> 1642, and of their In&s;tructions, do find indeed, that, by the &s;aid Order, the &s;aid <HI>Robert Reynolds,</HI> and <HI>Robert Goodwin,</HI> were to have the Credence, Power, and E&s;teem of a Committee &s;ent hither by the Advice, and Authority of both Hou&s;es of Parliament; and that, by the &s;aid In&s;tructions, they were to be admitted to be pre|&s;ent, and Vote at all Con&s;ultations concerning the War; yet there is nothing in the &s;aid Order, or In&s;tructions, for admitting them to &s;it, or be pre&s;ent at his Maje&s;ties Council Table; which is that which his Maje&s;ty, by his &s;aid Letters, required, &s;hould not be permitted; which <MILESTONE N="10"> cannot be conceiv'd to be a deve&s;ting them of any Authority given&endq; them by both Hou&s;es.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;AND as to the late Alteration of Government here, expre&s;&s;ed in your Letters, although his Maje&s;ty, in his high wi&s;dom, adjudged it fit to alter one of tho&s;e Governours, which he had placed here, which was no more than He, and his Royal Predece&s;&s;ors had u&s;ually done in all Ages, as often as they thought fit, yet that made no alteration in the Government; but it in all times continued, and &s;till continues&endq; the &s;ame, though in other Per&s;ons.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;THAT part of your Letters which declares, that you are forbidden to tell Us what Supplies of Money, Victual, Ammunition, and other Nece&s;&s;aries, were then in a good forwardne&s;s to be &s;ent hither for the &s;upport of the Officers, and Soldiers here, requires no An&s;wer on Our parts, other than this truth, that they are not yet arrived here. Con|cerning <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI>'s Letters to Colonel <HI>Crawford,</HI> We know of no Trea|&s;on to be di&s;cover'd thereby; but for the Sea Captains in your Letters mention'd, it is certain that their neglects and mi&s;deeds de&s;erve pu|ni&s;hment, which We de&s;ire they may find rather to their correction,&endq; than to their ruin.</Q></P>

THE di&s;tractions in <HI>Ireland</HI> being, by means of the Ce&s;&s;ation, in &s;ome degree allayed, and both Parties having time to breath, the King, in the next place, con&s;ider'd how he might apply that Ce&s;&s;ation to the Ad|vancement of his Affairs in <HI>England.</HI> One of the principal Motives that induced that Ce&s;&s;ation, was the mi&s;erable State of the Army there, ready, through extreme wants, to disband; &s;o that there being now le&s;s u&s;e of them there, and an impo&s;&s;ibility to keep them, his Maje&s;ty had it only in his Election, whether he &s;hould &s;uffer them there to disband, and di&s;po&s;e of them&s;elves as they thought fit, which could not be with|out <MILESTONE N="10"> infinite di&s;order, and might probably prove as much to his parti|cular di&s;&s;ervice; or whether he &s;hould draw over &s;uch a Number as might be &s;afely &s;pared, to his own A&s;&s;i&s;tance in <HI>England;</HI> to which he was a&s;&s;ured, that the devotion, and affection of mo&s;t of the principal or con&s;iderable Officers there, chearfully inclined; and of this latter he made little &s;cruple to make choice, when he was not only informed of the preparations and readine&s;s in <HI>Scotland,</HI> to invade this Kingdom; but that they had called over their old General, the Earl of <HI>Leven,</HI> who Commanded the <HI>Scotch</HI> Forces in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and many other Officers and Soldiers out of that Kingdom, to form and conduct their Army into <MILESTONE N="20"> This; and that there were al&s;o Arts and Indu&s;try u&s;ed, by &s;ome Agents for the Parliament, to per&s;wade the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Officers likewi&s;e to bring over their Men for their Service.</P>

<P>THE Court at <HI>Oxford</HI> was much encrea&s;ed by the Queen's Pre&s;ence, and the nece&s;&s;ities were encrea&s;ed with the expence. All corre&s;pondence was ab&s;olutely broken with <HI>London,</HI> in&s;omuch as a &s;worn Me&s;&s;enger of the Chamber, &s;ent to <HI>London</HI> with a Writ, and Proclamation for the Adjournment of the Term to <HI>Oxford,</HI> was apprehended as a Spy (as hath been &s;aid before) and executed by Martial Law; and the two Hou&s;es had cau&s;ed a Great Seal to be made with the King's Image, and In&s;cription, and put the &s;ame into the hands of Commi&s;&s;ioners; and &s;o the Courts were continued in <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter-</HI>Hall, for the di&s;patch of Ju&s;tice (as they call'd it) as had been formerly, notwith&s;tanding the King's Proclamation.

<P>ACCORDING to the King's Proclamation, the Members of both Hou&s;es of Parliament, who had withdrawn out of Con&s;cience and Du|ty <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Members of both Hou&s;es met at</HI> Ox|ford.</NOTE> from tho&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> appear'd at <HI>Oxford</HI> at the day appointed; except &s;uch as could not rea&s;onably be ab&s;ent from their Commands in the Counties, where the Armies were. They were graciou&s;ly, and &s;o|lemnly welcom'd by his Maje&s;ty, with that Ceremony which is u&s;ed at the opening of a Parliament; when his Maje&s;ty told them: <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P><Q>&startq;THAT he had called them to be Witne&s;&s;es of his Actions, and privy <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Sub&s;tance of the King's Speech to them.</NOTE> to his Intentions; and that he de&s;ired to receive any Advice from them, which they thought would be &s;uitable to the mi&s;erable and di|&s;tracted condition of the Kingdom; in pre&s;enting whereof, they &s;hould u&s;e all that Parliamentary freedom which would be due to them if they were with him at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> and which, with all their other Priviledges, they &s;hould enjoy at <HI>Oxford,</HI> though they could not in&endq; the other place;</Q> with many expre&s;&s;ions of grace towards them, and confidence in them. A&s;&s;oon as they had withdrawn to tho&s;e places which were a&s;&s;ign'd to their Coun&s;els, both Lords and Commons enter'd <MILESTONE N="20"> upon the deliberation of all po&s;&s;ible expedients, in order to Peace; mo&s;t Men believing, according to the rea&s;on and con&s;cience of their own hearts, that the difficulty was greater, to di&s;po&s;e tho&s;e at <HI>London</HI> to the hone&s;ty and confidence of a Treaty, than, in that Treaty, to agree on &s;uch Conclu&s;ions as might be &s;atisfactory to all Parties; judging it im|po&s;&s;ible, that Men could de&s;ire to bring ruin and de&s;olation upon their Country, if they were once per&s;waded that it might be prevented with their own pre&s;ervation. But how to advance to any formality, which probably might produce a di&s;po&s;ition to intercour&s;e, appeared very <MILESTONE N="30"> hard. When they thought of advi&s;ing the King to &s;end a gracious Me&s;|&s;age and Overture to the two Hou&s;es, they pre&s;ently remember'd, and con&s;ider'd, what his Maje&s;ty had already done that way, and how ill re|turns of Reverence and Duty, he had receiv'd from them: That to the two la&s;t Me&s;&s;ages he had &s;ent (it being not po&s;&s;ible now to &s;end any more gracious and obliging) they had never return'd An&s;wer, and that they &s;till detain'd his la&s;t Me&s;&s;enger in &s;trict durance, after having ex|po&s;ed him to a Tryal for his Life at a Court of War: That they had prohibited any kind of Addre&s;s to be made to them from his Maje&s;ty, except through the hands of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> their General. From thence tho&s;e at <HI>Oxford</HI> enter'd upon the di&s;qui&s;ition, how they might engage his Lord&s;hip to the &s;ame thoughts and de&s;ires with them; to the which they ea&s;ily believ'd, Experience, Ob&s;ervation, and Intere&s;t, would engage him. They per&s;waded them&s;elves, that the principal ground which had hitherto fru&s;trated all Overtures from his Maje&s;ty towards Peace, was the Con&s;cience tho&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> had of their own guilt, and the jealou&s;y, that proceeded from thence, that no Peace could &s;e|cure them, whil&s;t there was power left in his Maje&s;ty; but that they could not po&s;&s;ibly &s;u&s;pect the performance and exact ob&s;ervation of any agreement, which &s;hould be concluded upon the interce&s;&s;ion of all the King's Party; which mu&s;t be &s;ecurity for the accompli&s;hment of it From the rea&s;onablene&s;s of this A&s;&s;ertion, they entertain'd an A&s;&s;urance that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> would as greedily embrace the opportunity, an$
<PB N="339" REF="3860">
concur with them in promoting the Overture; which was all they de|fired: for that would remove tho&s;e forms, which, as &s;o many Rocks, were in the way. Hereupon the Lords and Commons, the members of both Hou&s;es, re&s;olv'd to write a Letter to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> in their own Names, which, with the King's Con&s;ent, was by Trumpet &s;ent to him, within four days after their meeting.

<P>THIS Letter was Sub&s;cribed by his Highne&s;s the Prince, the Duke of <HI>York,</HI> and three and forty Dukes, Marqui&s;&s;es, Earls, Vi&s;counts, and Barons, and one hundred and eighteen Members of the Hou&s;e of Com|mons; there being &s;uch expedition u&s;ed in the di&s;patch, that it was not thought fit to be deferr'd for a greater Sub&s;cription: Albeit it was known <MILESTONE N="20"> that many Lords and Commoners were upon the way, who came within few days; and there were, at that time, near twenty Peers ab&s;ent with his Maje&s;ties leave, and employed in his Affairs, and Armies, in the Kingdom; and ten at the &s;ame time in the Parts beyond the Seas.

<P>THE Trumpeter found the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> at his Hou&s;e in <HI>London,</HI> where he was detain'd three or four days; during which time, the Com|mittee of both Hou&s;es, that Committee which they called the Com|mittee of Safety for the two Kingdoms (the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners being a part of it) re&s;orted to the Earl for his Advice: and in the end, the Trumpeter return'd with this &s;hort Letter to the Earl of <HI>Forth,</HI> the King's General.</P>

WHAT the Covenant was, being the &s;ame particularly &s;et down be|fore, I need not mention; and the Declarations are as publick, and would be thought too large to be in this place in&s;erted, to the inter|ruption of the thread of this di&s;cour&s;e; yet it cannot be ami&s;s to make a &s;hort Extract of &s;ome particular heads, or conclu&s;ions of them; that the world may &s;ee what kind of rea&s;oning this time had introduced, and that they were as bold with God as with the King.</P>
<P>THAT Declaration of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> alone, was, to ju&s;tify <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Extract of the Decla|ration of the Kingdom of</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> their pre&s;ent expedition into <HI>England;</HI> in which they &s;aid, <Q>&startq;It was mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary, that every one, again&s;t all doubting, &s;hould be per&s;waded in his mind of the lawfulne&s;s of his Undertaking, and of the goodne&s;s <MILESTONE N="10"> of the Cau&s;e maintain'd by him; which they &s;aid was no other, than the good of Religion in <HI>England,</HI> and the deliverance of their Brethren out of the depths of Affliction; the pre&s;ervation of their own Reli|gion, and of Them&s;elves from the extremity of Mi&s;ery, and the Safety of their Native King, and his Kingdoms, from de&s;truction and de&s;ola|tion. Any one of which (they &s;aid) by all Law divine, and humane, was too ju&s;t cau&s;e of taking of Armes; how much more, when all of them were joyn'd in one? And therefore, they wi&s;h'd ar$$ Man, who did withdraw, and hide him&s;elf in &s;uch a Debate and Controver&s;y, to <MILESTONE N="20"> con&s;ider, whether he were not a hater of his Brethren, again&s;t Chri|&s;tian and common Charity; an hater of Him&s;elf and his Po&s;terity, again&s;t the law and light of Nature; an hater of the King, and his Kingdoms, again&s;t Loyalty, and common Duty; and a hater of God,&endq; again&s;t all Religion, and Peace.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEY &s;aid, &startq;the Que&s;tion was not, nor need they di&s;pute, whether they might propagate their Religion by Armes; but whether, accord|ing to their power, they ought to a&s;&s;i&s;t their Brethren in <HI>England,</HI> who were calling for their help, and were &s;hedding their Blood in de|fence of that power without which Religion could neither be defended, nor reform'd; nor unity of Religion with them, and other Reform'd <MILESTONE N="30"> Kirks, be attained. So that, they &s;aid, the que&s;tion was no &s;ooner rightly &s;tated, but it was a&s;&s;oon re&s;olv'd; and concluded, <HI>that the Lord would &s;ave them from the cur&s;e of Meroz, who came not to help the Lord again&s;t the Mighty.</HI> They &s;aid, the Que&s;tion could not be, as their Enemies would make it, whether they &s;hould enter into <HI>England,</HI> and lift Armes again&s;t their own King, who had promi&s;ed and done as much, as might &s;ecure them in their own Religion, and Liberties: but whether again&s;t the Popi&s;h, Prelatical, and Malignant Party, their Adherents prevailing in <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> they were not bound <MILESTONE N="40"> to provide for their own pre&s;ervation. That they might well have known, from their continual experience, ever &s;ince the time of their fir&s;t Reformation, e&s;pecially after the two Kingdoms were united un|der one Head and Monarch, and from the Principles of their own De|clarations, in the time of their late Troubles and Dangers, that they could not long, like <HI>Go&s;hen,</HI> enjoy their light, if darkne&s;s &s;hould cover the face of other Reform'd Kirks: that <HI>Juda</HI> could not long continue in Liberty, if <HI>I&s;rael</HI> were led away in Captivity; and that the condi|tion of the one Kirk and Kingdom, whether in Religion or Peace, mu&s;t&endq; be common to both.</Q></P>
<P><Q>&startq;THEY &s;aid the Que&s;tion was not, whether they &s;hould pre&s;ume to be Arbitrators in the matter, now debated by Fire and Sword, betwixt his Maje&s;ty and the Hou&s;es of Parliament; which might &s;eem to be
<PB N="342" REF="3890">
forreign and extrin&s;ecal to that Nation, and wherein they might be conceiv'd to have no Intere&s;t; but whether, their Mediation and In|terce&s;&s;ion being rejected by the one Side, upon hope of Victory, or &s;up|po&s;e by both &s;ides, upon confidence of their own &s;trength and &s;everal Succe&s;&s;es, it were not their duty, it being in their power, to &s;top or prevent the Effu&s;ion of Chri&s;tian Blood; or whether they ought not to endeavour to re&s;cue their Native King, his Crown, and Po&s;terity, out of the mid&s;t of &s;o many dangers, and to pre&s;erve his People and Kingdom from ruin and de&s;truction. If every private Man were bound in duty to interpo&s;e him&s;elf as a Reconciler, and Seque&s;trator between <MILESTONE N="10"> his Neighbours, arm'd to their mutual de&s;truction; if the Son ought to hazard his own Life for the pre&s;ervation of his Father and Brother, at Variance one again&s;t the other, &s;hould a Kingdom &s;it &s;till, and &s;uffer their King and Neighbouring Kingdom to peri&s;h in an unnatural War? In the time of Animo&s;ity, and appetite of Revenge, &s;uch an Inter|po&s;ing might be an irritation; but afterwards, when the Eyes of the mind, no more blood-run with pa&s;&s;ion, did di&s;cern things right, it would be no grief or offence of heart, but matter of thank&s;giving to God, and to the In&s;truments which had kept from &s;hedding Blood,&endq; and from Revenge.</Q></P>
<P>WITH this kind of Divinity, and this kind of Logic, to &s;hew that <MILESTONE N="20"> they had a clear pro&s;pect of whatever could be &s;aid again&s;t them, they re&s;olv'd to Invade their Neighbour Nation, and to interpo&s;e them&s;elves as Reconcilers, by joyning again&s;t their Native and Natural King, with his Rebellious Subjects, in all the Acts of Animo&s;ity and Blood, which have been ever practiced in the mo&s;t raging, and furious Civil War.</P>
<P>THE other Declaration, mention'd in the Earl's Letter, was a De|claration <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Extract of the Decla|ration of</HI> England <HI>and</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> pa&s;&s;ed, and publi&s;hed in the Name of both Kingdoms, <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland,</HI> after their Marriage by their new League and Covenant, and about the very time that this very Overture for Peace came from <HI>Oxford.</HI> They were now both equally in&s;pired with the <HI>Scoth</HI> Dialect and Spirit; <Q>talk'd, &startq;how clearly the light of the Go&s;pel &s;hined among&s;t them; that they placed not their confidence in their own Coun&s;els and Strength; but their confidence was in God Almighty, the Lord of Ho&s;ts, who would not leave nor for&s;ake his People. It was his own Truth and Cau&s;e, which they maintain'd again&s;t the Here&s;y, Super&s;ti|tion, and Tyranny of Anti-Chri&s;t: the Glory of his Name, the exalta|tion of the Kingdom of his Son, and the pre&s;ervation of his Church was their aime, and the end which they had before their Eyes. It was His Covenant, which they had &s;olemnly in both Nations Sworn, and Sub&s;cribed; which he would not have put in their hearts to do, if he had been minded to de&s;troy them. Upon the&s;e and the like grounds, and con&s;iderations, being confident that this War, wherein both Na|tions were &s;o firmly united, and deeply engaged, was of God, they re|&s;olve with Courage and Con&s;tancy to the end to do their part; and the Lord who had &s;tirred up their Spirits, di&s;played his Banner before&endq; them, and given the Alarm, do that which &s;eemeth him good.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEY gave now &startq;Publick warning to all Men to re&s;t no longer upon their Neutrality, or to plea&s;e them&s;elves with the naughty and &s;loth|ful pretext of indifferency; but that they addre&s;s them&s;elves &s;peedily to take the Covenant, and joyn, with all their power, in the Defence of this Cau&s;e again&s;t the Common Enemy; and by their Zeal, and for|wardne&s;s hereafter, to make up what had been wanting through their
<PB N="343" REF="3900">
lukewarmne&s;s; this they would find to be their greate&s;t wi&s;dom, and &s;afety; otherwi&s;e they did declare them to be Publick Enemies to their Religion, and Country; and that they were to be cen&s;ur'd and&endq; puni&s;h'd, as profe&s;&s;ed Adver&s;aries, and Malignants.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THEN they proclaim'd &startq;a Pardon to all tho&s;e who would before &s;uch&endq; a day de&s;ert the King,</Q> and adhere to them, and take the Covenant; and concluded, <Q>&startq;that they made not that Declaration, from any pre|&s;umption, or vain glorying in the &s;trength of their Armies and Forces, but from the &s;en&s;e of their Duty, which was required and expected from the high Places, and publick Relations, wherein they &s;tood; and from the A&s;&s;urance they had of the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of God, by who&s;e provi|dence, <MILESTONE N="10"> the tru&s;t and &s;afety of tho&s;e Kingdoms was put into their hands at this time; having, after long and grave Con&s;ultation, re&s;olv'd and decreed never to lay down Armes, till Truth and Peace, by the ble&s;&s;ing of God, be &s;ettled in this I&s;land, upon a firm foundation for the pre&s;ent, and future Generations; which, they &s;aid, &s;hould be e&s;teem'd of them&endq; an abundant reward of all that they could do,</Q> or &s;uffer in that Cau&s;e.</P>
<P>THESE were the Declarations which the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> together with the Covenant, &s;ent, as an An&s;wer to that Letter from the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and tho&s;e Lords and Gentlemen; which might have been the foundation of an Hone&s;t, and Honourable Peace to all the King's Domi|nions. <MILESTONE N="20"> And I cannot but ob&s;erve, that after this time that the Earl de|clined this opportunity of declaring him&s;elf, he never did pro&s;perous Act in the remainder of his Life; but whereas before, he had throughout the Cour&s;e of his Command, how unwarrantably &s;oever undertaken, behaved him&s;elf with very &s;ignal Courage and Conduct, and at this time was adorn'd with the Te&s;timony of Friends and Enemies, of a right good General, upon the conclu&s;ion of the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> he never, after his taking this Covenant, and writing this Letter, did one &s;ucce&s;s|ful thing; but proved unfortunate in all he went about, even to his <MILESTONE N="30"> death; of which We &s;hall &s;ay more in it's place.</P>
<P>WE the rather extracted the&s;e &s;hort Clau&s;es of tho&s;e two Declara|tions, that Po&s;terity may ob&s;erve the divine hand of Almighty God upon the People of the&s;e mi&s;erable Kingdoms; that after they had broken loo&s;e from that excellent Form and practice of Religion, which their Ance&s;tors, and Them&s;elves had ob&s;erv'd, and enjoy'd, with a greater mea&s;ure of happine&s;s, than allmo&s;t any Nation lived under, &s;o long a time; and after they had cancelled, and thrown off tho&s;e admirable and incomparable Laws of Government, which was compounded of &s;o much $ exact rea&s;on, that all po&s;&s;ible mi&s;chiefs were fore&s;een, and provided again&s;t by it; they &s;hould be now captivated by a Prophane and Pre|&s;umptuous entitling them&s;elves to God's favour, and u&s;ing his holy Name in that manner, that all &s;ober Chri&s;tians mu&s;t &s;tand &s;candalized, and amazed at; and &s;hould be deluded by &s;uch a kind of rea&s;oning and de|bate, as, one would think, could only impo&s;e upon Men unnurtur'd, and unacquainted with any Knowledge or Science.</P>
<P>THERE wanted not a ju&s;t indignation at the return of this Trumpet; and yet the An&s;wer being &s;o much in that popular road, of &s;aying &s;ome|thing plau&s;ibly to the People, it was thought fit again to make an at|tempt, that at lea&s;t the world might &s;ee, that they did, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> refu&s;e to admit of any Peace. So the Earl of <HI>Forth</HI> was advi&s;ed to write again to the other General, for a &s;afe Conduct for two Gentlemen then named, again&s;t whom no imaginable exception could be taken, to and
<PB N="344" REF="3910">
from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> to be &s;ent by his Maje&s;ty concerning a Treaty of Peace. <Q>To this the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> return'd An&s;wer, &startq;that when&s;oever he &s;hould receive any directions to tho&s;e who had intru&s;ted him, he &s;hould u&s;e his be&s;t Endeavours; and when a &s;afe Conduct &s;hould be de&s;ired for tho&s;e Gentlemen, mention'd in his Letter, from his Ma|je&s;ty to the Hou&s;es of Parliament, his Lord&s;hip would, with all chear|fulne&s;s, &s;hew his willingne&s;s to farther any way that might produce that happine&s;s, which all hone&s;t Men prayed for; which is a true un|der&s;tanding between his Maje&s;ty, and his faithful, and only Council,&endq; the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Expre&s;&s;ion of his re&s;olution of interpo&s;ing, if he had a Letter <MILESTONE N="10"> from his Maje&s;ty to the Hou&s;es of Parliament (together with &s;ome inti|mation in Letters from <HI>London,</HI> which at the&s;e Sea&s;ons never wanted) per&s;waded many, that the Earl wanted only an opportunity to po&s;&s;e&s;s the Hou&s;es with the Overture, and if it were once within the Walls, there were &s;o many well affected to Peace, that the Propo&s;ition would not be rejected; though no particular Per&s;on, or Combination of Men, had the courage, of them&s;elves, to propo&s;e it. And therefore at the &s;ame time, making all po&s;&s;ible preparations for the Field, as the Scene where the differences were like to be decided, his Maje&s;ty&punc; was prevailed with, though he concluded it would be rejected, to &s;end this en&s;uing Me&s;&s;age, <MILESTONE N="20"> which was enclo&s;ed to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to be by him managed.</P>

</LETTER>
<P>THE hope of Peace, by this kind of interpo&s;ition, did not in any de|gree <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Means agreed upon by the Lords and Commons at</HI> Oxford <HI>to rai&s;e Money.</HI></NOTE> make the Coun&s;els remi&s;s for the providing of Money to &s;upply <MILESTONE N="10"> the Army: Upon which they had more hope than from a Treaty. But the Expedients for Money were not ea&s;ily thought on; though there was a con&s;iderable part of the Kingdom within the King's Quarters, the Inhabitants were frequently robbed, and plunder'd by the Incur&s;ions of the Enemy, and not very well &s;ecured again&s;t the Royal Troops, who begun to practice all the Licence of War. The Nobility, and Gentry, who were not Officers of the Army, lived for the mo&s;t part in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and all that they could draw from their E&s;tates, was but enough for their own Sub&s;i&s;tence; they dur&s;t not enter upon charging the People in general, le&s;t they &s;hould be thought to take upon them to be a Par|liament; <MILESTONE N="20"> and their care was, that the Common People might be pre|&s;erv'd from Burthens; and they were as careful not to expo&s;e the King's Honour, or Name, to affronts and refu&s;als; but were willing that the Envy and Clamour, if there &s;hould be any, &s;hould fall upon Them|&s;elves.</P>
<P><Q>THEY appointed all the Members of the Commons, &startq;to bring in the Names of all the Gentlemen of E&s;tate, and other Per&s;ons who were reputed to be rich, within their &s;everal precincts; and what Sum of Money every Body might be well able to &s;upply the King with, in&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> this exigent of the publick State.</Q> And then a form of a Letter was conceiv'd, which &s;hould be &s;ent to every one of them, for &s;uch a Sum; <Q>&startq;the Letter to be Sub&s;cribed by the two Speakers of the Hou&s;es, to the end that the People might know, that it was by the advice of the Members of Parliament a&s;&s;embled there; which was as much the ad|vice&endq; of Parliament, as could be deliver'd at that time in the Kingdom.</Q> When the way and method of this was approv'd by the Lords, and his Maje&s;ty likewi&s;e con&s;ented to it; they begun, the better to encourage others, with Them&s;elves; and cau&s;ed Letters to be &s;ign'd and deliver'd to the &s;everal Members of both Hou&s;es, for &s;uch Sums as they were well di&s;po&s;ed to furni&s;h; which were to that proportion as gave good Encouragement to others; and the like Letters to all Per&s;ons of condi|tion who were in the Town. And by this means, there was a Sum rai&s;ed in ready Money, and Credit, that did &s;upply many nece&s;&s;ary occa&s;ions, near the Sum of one hundred thou&s;and pounds, whereof &s;ome came in every day, to enable the King to provide for the next Campagne; which, the Spring coming on, was to be expected early; the Parliament at <HI>Westminster</HI> having rai&s;ed va&s;t Sums of Money, and being like to bring many Armies into the Field. All, who were to furni&s;h Money upon the&s;e Letters, had liberty to bring, or &s;end it in Plate, if that wa$ for their convenience; the King having called the Officers and Work men of his Mint to <HI>Oxford,</HI> who Coyn'd &s;uch Plate as was brought in his Maje&s;ty likewi&s;e made a Grant of &s;ome Forre&s;ts, Parks, and oth$
<PB N="347" REF="3940">
Lands, to certain Per&s;ons in Tru&s;t, for the &s;ecuring of &s;uch Money as &s;hould be borrowed, or tho&s;e Per&s;ons who &s;hould be bound for the pay|ment of &s;uch Money; and by this means likewi&s;e many con&s;iderable Sums of Money were procured, and Cloath, and Shooes, and Shirts, were provided for the Army.</P>
<P>THE two Hou&s;es at <HI>Westminster,</HI> who called them&s;elves, and they are often called in this di&s;cour&s;e, the Parliament, had at this time by an Ordinance, that is an Order of both Hou&s;es, laid an impo&s;ition, which they called an Exci&s;e, upon Wine, Beer, Ale, and many other <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The two Hou&s;es at</HI> We&s;tmin&s;ter <HI>impo&s;e an Ex|ci&s;e.</HI></NOTE> Commodities, to be paid in the manner very punctually and methodi|cally &s;et down by them, for the carrying on the War. This was the <MILESTONE N="10"> fir&s;t time, that ever the Name of payment of Exci&s;e was heard of, or practiced in <HI>England;</HI> laid on by tho&s;e who pretended to be mo&s;t jea|lous of any exaction upon the People: and this Pattern being then printed, and publi&s;hed at <HI>London,</HI> was thought by the Members at <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> as a good Expedient to be followed by the King; and thereupon <NOTE PLACE="marg">The two Hou&s;es at Oxford $Span$.</NOTE> it was &s;ettled, and to be govern'd, and regulated by Commi&s;&s;ioners, in the &s;ame Method it was done at <HI>London.</HI> And in <HI>Oxford, Bri&s;tol,</HI> and other Garri&s;ons, it did yeild a rea&s;onable &s;upply fo$ the Provi&s;ion of Armes and Ammunition; which, for the mo&s;t part, it was a&s;&s;ign'd <MILESTONE N="20"> to; both &s;ides making ample Declarations, with bitter reproaches up|on the nece&s;&s;ity that drew on this impo&s;ition, <Q>&startq;that it &s;hould be con|tinued no longer than to the end of the War, and then $laid down,&endq; and utterly aboli&s;hed;</Q> which few wi&s;e Men believed it would e|ver be.</P>
<P>THE high and in&s;olent proceedings at <HI>Westminster,</HI> made no im|pre&s;&s;ion at <HI>Oxford</HI> towards the &s;haking the Allegiance, and Courage of tho&s;e whom his Maje&s;ty had called to advi&s;e him. But when they found the temper of the other &s;o much, above belief, aver&s;e to Peace, and intending utter ruin to the King, the Church, and all who &s;hould con|tinue <MILESTONE N="30"> true <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Men and Subjects, they re&s;olv'd as frankly to de|clare their Re&s;olutions, that the People might &s;ee the I&s;&s;ue they were at; and therefore they publi&s;hed a Declaration of the Grounds and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Sub&s;tance of the Decla|ration of the Lords and Commons at</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> Motives which had forced them to leave the Parliament at <HI>Westmin|ster;</HI> <Q>in which they mentioned &startq;all the indirect pa&s;&s;ages, and the Acts of Violence, by which they had been driven thence; and the obliga|tions upon them in Con&s;cience, and Law, to adhere to his Maje&s;ty; and the mi&s;ery which the other Party had already brought upon the Kingdom, and the de&s;olation which mu&s;t inevitably follow tho&s;e con|clu&s;ions:&endq;</Q> and with a greater Unanimity and Con&s;ent, than was ever <MILESTONE N="40"> known in &s;o great a Council, where there were &s;o many Per&s;ons of Ho|nour, and Judges, and others Learned in the Law, among whom there was &s;carce one di&s;&s;enting Voice, they declared,</P>
<P N="1">1. <Q>&startq;THAT all &s;uch Subjects of <HI>Scotland,</HI> as had con&s;ented to the Declaration, entitled the Declaration of the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland</HI> concerning the pre&s;ent expedition into <HI>England,</HI> had thereby de|nounced War again&s;t the Kingdom of <HI>England,</HI> and broke the Act of&endq; Pacification.</Q></P>
<P N="2">2. <Q>&startq;THAT all his Maje&s;ties Subjects of the Kingdom of <HI>England</HI> and Dominion of <HI>Wales,</HI> are both by their Allegiance, and the Act of Pacification, bound to re&s;i&s;t and repre&s;s all tho&s;e of <HI>Scotland</HI> as had, or &s;hould enter upon any part of his Maje&s;ties Realm and Dominions, as Traytors, and Enemies to the State; and that who&s;oever &s;hould

abet, aid, or a&s;&s;i&s;t the <HI>Scots</HI> in their Inva&s;ion, &s;hould be deemed as&endq; Traytors and Enemies to the State.</Q></P>
<P N="3">3. <Q>&startq;THAT the Lords and Commons remaining at <HI>Westminster,</HI> that had given their Votes, or Con&s;ent, to the rai&s;ing of Forces un|der the Command of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> or had been abetting, aiding, or a&s;&s;i&s;ting thereunto, had levied and rai&s;ed War again&s;t the King,&endq; and were therein guilty of High Trea&s;on.</Q></P>
<P N="4">4. <Q>&startq;THAT tho&s;e Lords and Commons remaining at <HI>Westminster,</HI> that had given their Votes and Con&s;ents for the making and u&s;ing a new Great Seal, had thereby Counterfeited the King's Great Seal,&endq; and therein committed High Trea&s;on.</Q> <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P N="5">5. <Q>&startq;THAT the Lords and Commons remaining at <HI>Westminster,</HI> who had given their con&s;ents to the pre&s;ent coming in of the <HI>Scots</HI> in a Warlike manner, had therein committed High Trea&s;on: and that in the&s;e three la&s;t Crimes, they had broken the Tru&s;t repo&s;ed in them by their Country, and ought to be proceeded again&s;t as Traytors to&endq; the King, and Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>SO that the Engagements &s;eem'd fuller of Animo&s;ity on both &s;ides, than ever; and the King exceedingly &s;trengthen'd by the Lords and Commons having more po&s;itively and concernedly wedded his Cau&s;e, <MILESTONE N="20"> than they were before under&s;tood to have done; and in truth, in the Civil Coun&s;els, nothing was left undone to give it all imaginable Ad|vancement.</P>
<P>IT had been very happy for the King, if the Winter had been &s;pent only in tho&s;e Coun&s;els which might have provided Money, and facili|tated the making his Army ready to take the Field in the Spring; when he was &s;ure to have occa&s;ion enough to u&s;e it, and to be in great di|&s;tre&s;s, if it &s;hould not be then in a condition to march; but the Inva|&s;ion, which the <HI>Scots</HI> made in the depth of Winter, and the Courage the Enemy took from thence, deprived his Maje&s;ty even of any re&s;t <MILESTONE N="30"> in that Sea&s;on. Upon the <HI>Scots</HI> unexpected march into <HI>England</HI> in <HI>January,</HI> in a mo&s;t violent Fro&s;t and Snow, hoping to reach <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> before it could be Fortified, and per&s;wading their Common Sol|diers, that it would be deliver'd to them a&s;&s;oon as required; thither the vigilant S^r <HI>Thomas Glemham</HI> had been before &s;ent to attend their coming, and the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle</HI> with his Army, upon the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> New-Ca|&s;tle <HI>marches to oppo&s;e the</HI> Scots.</NOTE> fame of their Inva&s;ion, marched thither with a re&s;olution to Fight with them before they &s;hould be able to joyn with the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Rebels; leaving in the mean time the Command of <HI>York,</HI> and the Forces for the guard of that County, to Colonel <HI>John Bella&s;is,</HI> Son to the Lord <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Falconbridge,</HI> a Per&s;on of great Intere&s;t in the Country, and of exem|plary Indu&s;try and Courage. But by this means&punc; and the remove of the Marquis with his Army &s;o far North, the Enemy grew to a great &s;trength in tho&s;e Parts; and not only able to di&s;quiet <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> but drawing a great Body of Hor&s;e and Foot out of <HI>Derby-&s;hire, Staf|ford-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Lincoln-&s;hire,</HI> &s;at down before his Maje&s;ties Garri&s;on of <HI>Newarke</HI> upon <HI>Trent,</HI> with a full confidence to take it; and &s;o to cut off all corre&s;pondence between his Maje&s;ty, and the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle.</HI> And S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> from <HI>Hull,</HI> in the head of a <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> Thomas Fairfax <HI>De|feats and takes Coll.</HI> Bella&s;is <HI>at</HI> Selby.</NOTE> &s;trong Party, had fallen upon a Quarter not far from <HI>York,</HI> Com|manded by Colonel <HI>John Bella&s;is</HI> at <HI>Selby,</HI> and had totally Defeated it, taken the Cannon, and many Officers Pri&s;oners, and among&s;t tho&s;e the Colonel him&s;elf.

<HI>Fairfax</HI> was taken Notice of; who in a &s;hort time grew the &s;upreme General under the Parliament. This Defeat, which was great in it &s;elf, was made much greater by the terrible apprehen&s;ions the City of <HI>York</HI> had upon it; in&s;omuch that the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> who till then had kept the <HI>Scots</HI> at a Bay, found it nece&s;&s;ary to withdraw his <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Whereupon the Marquis of</HI> New-Ca|&s;tle <HI>retires to</HI> York.</NOTE> Army, and with great part of it to make ha&s;t into <HI>York,</HI> to prevent any farther mi&s;chief there; by which means the <HI>Scots</HI> were at liberty to ad|vance as they plea&s;ed; and <HI>Fairfax</HI> improved his reputation by a &s;peedy, and unlook'd for march into <HI>Che&s;hire.</HI></P>
<P>UPON the Ce&s;&s;ation in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the King made the Marquis of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Marquis of</HI> Ormond <HI>made Lord Lieutenant of</HI> Ireland, <HI>&s;ends the King A&s;|&s;i&s;tance.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Ormond</HI> his Lieutenant of that Kingdom; and appointed him to make <MILESTONE N="10"> u&s;e of the Winter Sea&s;on (when the Parliament Ships could not at|tend that Coa&s;t) to tran&s;port tho&s;e Regiments of Foot which might be well &s;pared during the Ce&s;&s;ation, and which could not be &s;upported there, to <HI>Chester;</HI> from whence his Maje&s;ty could ea&s;ily draw them in the Spring to <HI>Oxford;</HI> and were, in truth, the principal Recruit, upon which he depended to enable him to take the Field. The Lord <HI>Byron</HI> then Commanded <HI>Chester,</HI> and that County; and was appoint|ed to take care for the reception, and accommodation of tho&s;e Troops; which was a right good Body of Foot, and being excellent Men, both Officers and Soldiers, carried great terror with them from the time <MILESTONE N="20"> of their Landing; and quickly freed North <HI>Wales</HI> from the Enemy; who at that time begun to have great power there. It was towards the end of <HI>November</HI> when they Landed, and being a People who had been u&s;ed to little ea&s;e in <HI>Ireland,</HI> the King having given the Lord <HI>Byron</HI> leave to employ them in &s;uch Services as might &s;ecure that Country, the Sea&s;on of the year made little impre&s;&s;ion on them; they were allways ready, and de&s;irous of Action; and in the &s;pace of a Month reduced, by A&s;&s;ault and Storm, many places of notable im|portance, as <HI>Howarden-</HI>Ca&s;tle, <HI>Beeston-</HI>Ca&s;tle, <HI>Crew-</HI>Hou&s;e, and other <MILESTONE N="30"> places of &s;trength; and encountering the whole Body of the Rebels, at <HI>Middlewich</HI> in <HI>Che&s;hire,</HI> Broke and Defeated them with great Slaughter; and drove all that Survived, and were at Liberty, into <HI>Nantwich;</HI> the &s;ingle Garri&s;on they had then left in <HI>Che&s;hire:</HI> into which the whole Party was retired, and which had been Fortified and Garri&s;oned from the begnning of the Troubles, as the only refuge for the di&s;affected in that County, and the Counties adjacent. The Pride of the late Succe&s;s, and the terror the Soldiers believ'd their Names carried with them, carried them at this mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;onable time of the year thither: for it was about the fir&s;t week in <HI>January</HI> when the Lord <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Byron</HI> came with his Army before the Town, and Summon'd it. It cannot be denied the reducing of that place at that time would have been of un&s;peakable importance to the King's Affairs, there being, between that and <HI>Carli&s;le,</HI> no one Town of Moment <HI>(Manchester</HI> only excepted) which declared again&s;t the King; and tho&s;e two po|pulous Counties of <HI>Chester,</HI> and <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> if they had been united again&s;t the Parliament, would have been a &s;trong Bulwark again&s;t the <HI>Scots.</HI></P>
<P>THESE con&s;iderations, and an opinion that the Town would yeild a&s;&s;oon as Summon'd, brought the Army fir&s;t thither; and then a pa&s;|&s;ionate de&s;ire of Honour, and Contempt of the Enemy within, or of any other who could undertake their relief, engaged them to a farther attempt; and &s;o they rai&s;ed Batteries, and undertook a formal Siege
<PB N="350" REF="3980">
again&s;t the Town. The &s;eventeenth day of <HI>January</HI> they made a ge|neral A&s;&s;ault upon five &s;everal Quarters of the Town, &s;omewhat be|fore day-break, but were with equal Courage oppo&s;ed from within, and near three hundred Men lo&s;t, or wounded in the Service; which &s;hould have prevailed with them to have quitted their de&s;ign. But tho&s;e repul&s;es &s;harpen, rather than abate the edge and appetite to dan|ger; and the A&s;&s;ailants, no le&s;s than the Be&s;ieged, de&s;iring an Army would come for their relief, both with equal impatience longed for the &s;ame thing; the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> (for under that name, for di&s;tinction &s;ake, we call that Body of Foot, though there was not an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Man among&s;t them) &s;uppo&s;ing them&s;elves Superior to any that would encounter <MILESTONE N="10"> them in the Field, and the Hor&s;e being &s;uch as might as rea&s;onably un|dervalue tho&s;e who were to oppo&s;e them.</P>
<P>IN this their confidence, &s;upply came too &s;oon to the Town, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Iri&s;h <HI>Forces routed by S^r</HI> Thomas Fairfax <HI>at</HI> Nantwich.</NOTE> confu&s;ion to the King's Forces: For S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> upon his Vi|ctory at <HI>Selby,</HI> brought out of <HI>York-&s;hire</HI> a good Body of Hor&s;e to <HI>Man|chester;</HI> and, out of that place, and the neighbour places, drew near three thou&s;and Foot, with which joyning with S^r <HI>William Bruerton,</HI> and &s;ome other &s;cattered Forces from <HI>Stafford-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Derby,</HI> who had been routed at <HI>Middlewich,</HI> he advanced near <HI>Nantwich,</HI> before he was looked for; the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> being &s;o over confident that he would <MILESTONE N="20"> not pre&s;ume to attack them, that, though they had Adverti&s;ement of their motion, they &s;till believ'd that his utmo&s;t de&s;ign was by Alarms to force them to ri&s;e from the Town, and then to retire without fight|ing with them. This made them keep their Po&s;ts too long; and when they found it nece&s;&s;ary to draw off, a little River, which divided their Forces, on a &s;uddain thaw, &s;o much &s;welled above it's Banks, that the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> with the greate&s;t part of the Hor&s;e, and the Foot which lay on one &s;ide of the Town, were &s;ever'd from the re&s;t, and compelled to march four or five miles, before he could joyn with the <MILESTONE N="30"> other; before which time the other part, being Charged by S^r <HI>Tho|mas Fairfax</HI> on the one &s;ide, and from the Town on the other, were broken; and all the Chief Officers forced to retire to a Church called <HI>Acton</HI> Church, where they were caught as in a Trap, and the Hor&s;e, by rea&s;on of the deep ways with the &s;uddain thaw, and narrow Lanes, and great Hedges, not being able to relieve them, were compelled to yeild them&s;elves Pri&s;oners to tho&s;e whom they &s;o much de&s;pi&s;ed two hours before. There were taken, be&s;ides all the Chief and Con&s;ider|able Officers of Foot, near fifteen hundred Soldiers, and all their Can|non, and Carriages: the Lord <HI>Byron</HI> with his Hor&s;e, and the re&s;t of <MILESTONE N="40"> his Foot, retiring to <HI>Chester.</HI> There cannot be given a better, or it may be another rea&s;on for this Defeat, be&s;ides the Providence of God, which was the effect of the other, than the extreme contempt and di&s;dain this Body had of the Enemy; and the pre&s;umption in their own Strength, Courage, and Conduct; which made them not enough think, and rely upon Him who alone di&s;po&s;es of the event of Battles: though it mu&s;t be acknowledged, mo&s;t of the Officers were Per&s;ons of &s;ignal Virtue, and Sobriety; and, in their own Natures, of great Mode&s;ty and Piety; &s;o hard it is to &s;uppre&s;s tho&s;e motions, which Succe&s;s, Va|lour, and even the Con&s;cience of the Cau&s;e, is apt to produce in Men not overmuch inclined to pre&s;umption.</P>
<P>THERE was another re&s;ult of Council at <HI>Oxford,</HI> in this Winter Sea&s;on, which de&s;erves to be mention'd; and the rather, becau&s;e all
<PB N="351" REF="3990">
the inducements thereunto were not generally under&s;tood, nor known to many; and therefore grew afterwards to be the more cen&s;ured. When the <HI>Scots</HI> were vi&s;ibly Arm'd, and upon their march into <HI>Eng|land,</HI> which the King was the la&s;t Man in believing; and when there was no way to &s;top, or divert them, his Maje&s;ty was the better in|clined to hearken to &s;ome Men of that Nation, who had been long propo&s;ing a way to give them &s;o much trouble at home, that they &s;hould not be at lei&s;ure to infe&s;t or trouble their Neighbours; to which Pro|po&s;itions le&s;s care had been given, out of too much confidence in Per|&s;ons, upon who&s;e integrity or intere&s;t there had been too great a de|pendence.

<P>UPON the beginning of the Parliament at <HI>Edenborough,</HI> and the manife&s;tation that Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> would give no oppo&s;ition to the pro|ceedings thereof (as hath been mention'd before) the Earl privately withdrew out of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and came to the King few days before the Siege was rai&s;ed from <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> and gave his Maje&s;ty the fir&s;t clear information of the carriage and behaviour of Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and of the po&s;ture that Kingdom would &s;peedily be in, and of the re&s;olutions that would be there taken; and made &s;ome &s;mart Propo&s;itions to the King for the remedy; which there was not then time to con&s;ult; but a&s;&s;oon as the King retired to <HI>Oxford,</HI> after the Battle of <HI>Newbury,</HI> and had had fuller Intelligence, by the re&s;ort of others of that Nobility who de&s;erved to be tru&s;ted, how the Affairs &s;tood in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and heard that Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> and his Brother, the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> were upon their way as far as <HI>York</HI> towards <HI>Oxford;</HI> his Maje&s;ty was very willing to hearken to the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> and the re&s;t, what could be done to prevent that mi&s;chief that was like to en&s;ue. But they all unanimou&s;ly declared, <Q>&startq;that they dur&s;t make no Propo&s;itions for the advancement of the King's Service, except they might be fir&s;t a&s;|&s;ured, that no part of it &s;hould be communicated to Duke <HI>Hamil|ton;</HI> nor He &s;uffer'd to have any part or &s;hare in any Action that &s;hould depend upon it; for they were mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured, that he had all|ways betrayed his Maje&s;ty; and that it had been ab&s;olutely in his power, to have prevented this new Combination, if he would re&s;o|lutely have oppo&s;ed it. But if they might be &s;ecure in that particu|lar, they would make &s;ome &s;uch attempt under his Maje&s;ties Com|mi&s;&s;ion in their own Country, as might po&s;&s;ibly make &s;ome di&s;tur|bance&endq; there.</Q> His Maje&s;ty thought he had much le&s;s rea&s;on to be confident of the Duke than formerly; for he had expre&s;sly failed of doing &s;omewhat which he had promi&s;ed to do; yet he thought, he had not ground enough to withdraw all kind of Tru&s;t from him, ex|cept he did, at the &s;ame time, &s;ecure him from being able to do him farther mi&s;chief; towards which kind of &s;everity, he did not think
<PB N="352" REF="4000">
he had evidence enough. Be&s;ides he had a very good opinion of the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> as a Man of much more plainne&s;s and &s;incerity, than his Brother; as in truth he was. That he might bring him&s;elf to a full re&s;olution in this important Affair, his Maje&s;ty appointed the Lord Keeper, his two Secretaries, the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to examine the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Kinnoul,</HI> the Lord <HI>Ogilby,</HI> and &s;ome others, upon Oath, of all things they could accu&s;e Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> or his Brother <HI>Lanrick</HI> of; and to take their Examinations in writing; that &s;o his Maje&s;ty might di&s;cover, whether their Errors proceeded from infidelity, and con&s;ider the better, what Cour&s;e to ob&s;erve in his proceedings with them; and this was carried with as much &s;ecrecy, as an Affair of that Nature could be, wherein &s;o many were tru&s;ted.</P>
<P>UPON their Examination, there appeared too much cau&s;e to con|clude, that the Duke had not behaved him&s;elf with that Loyalty, as he ought to have done. The Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> whil&s;t he had been of that Party, had been privy to much of his Corre&s;pondence, and In|telligence. But mo&s;t of the particulars related to the time when he Commanded the Fleet in the <HI>Frith,</HI> and when he had many Confe|rences with his Mother (who was a Woman mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ionate in tho&s;e contrivances) and with others of that Party; and when he did nothing to hurt, or incommodate the Enemy; all which was expre&s;sly par|doned by the Act of Oblivion, which had been pa&s;&s;ed with all forma|lity and &s;olemnity by the King in the Parliament of both Kingdoms: And, &s;o much as to que&s;tion what was &s;o forgot, might rai&s;e a greater fire, than that which they de&s;ired to quench; though the knowing &s;o many particulars might be a good and proper caution. In the late tran&s;actions of <HI>Scotland,</HI> it was manife&s;t that the Duke had ab&s;olutely oppo&s;ed all Overtures of force, and of &s;ei&s;ing tho&s;e Per&s;ons who could only be able to rai&s;e new Troubles; which had been very ea&s;y to have done; and that he had betrayed the King, and all the Lords, in con|&s;enting to the meeting of the Parliament, called and &s;ummoned again&s;t the King's expre&s;s Plea&s;ure and Command, and without any pretence of Law. And to this, the King's Approbation and Con&s;ent had been &s;hewed to them, by the Duke, under the King's own hand; which they dur&s;t not di&s;obey, though they fore&s;aw the mi&s;chief.</P>
<P>THE Ca&s;e was thus; <Q>the Duke had given the King an account, af|ter he had him&s;elf promi&s;ed him that the Parliament &s;hould never be a&s;&s;embled (which his Maje&s;ty abhorr'd) &startq;that though &s;ome few hot, and pa&s;&s;ionate Men, de&s;ired to put them&s;elves in Armes, to &s;top both Elections of the Members and any meeting together in Parliament; yet, that all &s;ober Men who could bear any con&s;iderable part in the Action, were clearly of the opinion, to take as much pains as they could to cau&s;e good Elections to be made, and then to appear them|&s;elves; and that they had hope to have &s;uch a Major part, that they might more advantageou&s;ly di&s;&s;olve the Meeting a&s;&s;oon as they came together, than prevent it; however, that Then would be the fit time to prote&s;t again&s;t it, and immediately to put them&s;elves into&endq; Armes,</Q> for which they would be well provided at the &s;ame time; and to this he de&s;ired the King's po&s;itive direction. <Q>And his Maje&s;ty, in An&s;wer to it, had &s;aid, &startq;&s;ince it was the opinion of all his Friends, he would not Command them to do that which was again&s;t their

Judgement; but would attend the Succe&s;s; and was content that they&endq; &s;hould all appear in the Parliament at it's fir&s;t meeting:</Q> and the Duke had &s;hewed the Lords tho&s;e words in the King's Letter, with which they acquie&s;ced, without knowing any thing of the ground of &s;uch his permi&s;&s;ion: whereas, in truth, there was no one Per&s;on who was of that opinion, or had given that Coun&s;el, but had &s;till dete&s;ted the Ex|pedient when propo&s;ed.</P>
<P>THEN the Duke's Carriage in the Parliament, and his Brothers, at their fir&s;t coming together, appeared to be as is &s;et down before, by the te&s;timony of tho&s;e who were pre&s;ent; and the Earl of <HI>Lanrick</HI>'s applying the Signet to the Proclamation for that Rendezvous where <MILESTONE N="10"> the Army was to be compounded, was not thought capable of any ex|cu&s;e; and &s;o the clear &s;tate of the Evidence, upon the Depo&s;itions of the Per&s;ons examined, was pre&s;ented to the King for his own deter|mination. His Maje&s;ty had &s;ome thoughts of &s;ending to the Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> to &s;top the Duke and his Brother at <HI>York,</HI> and not &s;uf|fer them to come nearer; but whil&s;t that was in deliberation, they both came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and meant the &s;ame night to have ki&s;&s;ed their Maje&s;ties hands; but a&s;&s;oon as they arrived, they received a Command from the King, <Q>&startq;&endq; to keep their Chambers;</Q> and had a Guard attended them. The King re&s;olv'd to con&s;ult the whole Affair then with the <MILESTONE N="20"> Council Board, whereas, hitherto the Examinations had been taken by a Committee, to the end that he might re&s;olve what way to pro|ceed; and to that purpo&s;e directed that a Tran&s;cript might be pre|pared, of all the Examinations at large; and that the Witne&s;&s;es might be ready to appear before the Board, if it &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary: His Maje&s;ty at that time inclining to have both the Lords pre&s;ent, and the Depo&s;itions read, and the Witne&s;&s;es confronted before them. But whil&s;t this was preparing, the &s;econd morning after their coming to the Town, the Earl of <HI>Lanrick,</HI> either having corrupted or deluded <MILESTONE N="30"> the Guard, found a means to e&s;cape; and by the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of one <HI>Cun|ningham</HI> (a Gentleman of the Privy Chamber, and of that Nation) had Hor&s;es ready; with which the Earl and his Friend fled, and went directly to <HI>London;</HI> where he was very well receiv'd. Hereupon the King inform'd the Board of the whole Affair; and becau&s;e one of them was e&s;caped, and the matters again&s;t the other having been tran&s;acted in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and &s;o, in many re&s;pects, it was not a Sea&s;on to proceed judicially again&s;t him, it was thought enough for the pre&s;ent to prevent his doing farther mi&s;chief, by putting him under a &s;ecure re&s;traint: and &s;o he was &s;ent in Cu&s;tody to the Ca&s;tle at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and from thence <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke</HI> Hamil|ton <HI>made Pri|&s;oner at</HI> Ox|ford.</NOTE> to <HI>Exeter,</HI> and &s;o to the Ca&s;tle at <HI>Pendennis</HI> in <HI>Cornwal;</HI> where We &s;hall at the pre&s;ent leave him.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time the Councils at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter</HI> lo&s;t a principal Sup|porter, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>M^r</HI> Pym<HI>'s death.</HI></NOTE> by the death of <HI>Jo. Pym;</HI> who died with great Torment and Agony of a di&s;ea&s;e unu&s;ual, and therefore the more &s;poken of, <HI>Morbus pediculo&s;us,</HI> as was reported; which render'd him an object very loath|&s;ome to tho&s;e who had been mo&s;t delighted with him. No Man had more to an&s;wer for the mi&s;eries of the Kingdom, or had his Hand, or Head, deeper in their contrivance. And yet, I believe, they grew much higher even in his life, than he de&s;ign'd. He was a Man of a private Quality and Condition of li$e; his Education in the Office of the <HI>Ex|chequer,</HI> where he had been a Clerk; and his parts rather acquired by
<PB N="354" REF="4030">
Indu&s;try, than &s;upplied by Nature, or adorned by Art. He had been well known in former Parliaments; and was one of tho&s;e few, who had &s;ate in many; the long intermi&s;&s;ion of Parliaments having worn out mo&s;t of tho&s;e who had been acquainted with the Rules, and Orders ob|&s;erv'd in tho&s;e Conventions. This gave him &s;ome reputation, and re|verence among&s;t tho&s;e who were but now introduced.</P>
<P>HE had been mo&s;t taken notice of, for being concerned and pa&s;|&s;ionate in the jealou&s;ies of Religion, and much troubled with the coun|tenance which had been given to tho&s;e opinions that had been imputed to <HI>Arminius;</HI> and this gave him great Authority and Intere&s;t with tho&s;e who were not plea&s;ed with the Government of the Church, o$ the growing power of the Clergy: yet him&s;elf indu&s;triou&s;ly took care to be believ'd, and he profe&s;s'd to be very entire to the Doctrine and Di&s;cipline of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> In the &s;hort Parliament before this, he &s;poke much, and appeared to be the mo&s;t leading Man; for be&s;ides the exact knowledge of the Former, and Orders of that Coun|cil, which few Men had, he had a very comely and grave way of ex|pre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, with great volubility of words, natural, and proper&punc; and under&s;tood the Temper and Affections of the Kingdom as well as any Man; and had ob&s;erv'd the errors and mi&s;takes in Government&punc; and knew well how to make them appear greater than they were. Af|ter the unhappy Di&s;&s;olution of that Parliament, he continued for the mo&s;t part about <HI>London,</HI> in Conver&s;ation and great Repute among&s;t tho&s;e Lords who were mo&s;t &s;trangers to the Court, and were believ'd mo&s;t aver&s;e to it; in whom he improved all imaginable jealou&s;ies, and di&s;contents towards the State; and a&s;&s;oon as this Parliament was re|&s;olv'd to be &s;ummon'd, he was as diligent to procure &s;uch Per&s;ons to be elected as he knew to be mo&s;t inclined to the way he meant to take.</P>
<P>AT the fir&s;t opening of this Parliament, he appeared pa&s;&s;ionate and prepared again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Strafford;</HI> and though in private de&s;ign|ing he was much govern'd by M^r <HI>Hambden,</HI> and M^r <HI>Saint John,</HI> yet he &s;eem'd to all Men to have the greate&s;t Influence upon the Hou&s;e of Commons of any Man; and, in truth, I think he was at that time, and &s;ome Months after, the mo&s;t popular Man, and the mo&s;t able to do hurt, that hath lived in any time. Upon the fir&s;t de&s;ign of &s;oftning, and obliging the powerful Per&s;ons in both Hou&s;es, when it was re&s;olv'd to make the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> Lord High Trea&s;urer of <HI>England,</HI> the King likewi&s;e intended to make M^r <HI>Pym</HI> Chancellor of the Exchequer; for which he receiv'd his Maje&s;ties promi&s;e, and made a return of a &s;uitable profe&s;&s;ion of his &s;ervice and devotion; and thereupon, the other being no &s;ecret, &s;omewhat declined from that &s;harpne&s;s in the Hou&s;e, which was more Popular than any Man's, and made &s;ome Overtures to provide for the Glory and Splendor of the Crown; in which he had &s;o ill &s;ucce&s;s, that his Intere&s;t and Reputation there, vi&s;ibly abated; and he found that he was much better able to do Hurt than Good; which wrought very much upon him to Melancholy, and complaint of the violence and di&s;compo&s;ure of the Peoples Affections, and In|clinations. In the end, whether, upon the death of the Earl of <HI>Bed|ford,</HI> he de&s;paired of that preferment, or whether he was guilty of any thing, which, upon his Conver&s;ion to the Court, he thought might be di&s;cover'd to his damage, or for pure want of Courage, he &s;uffer'd him&s;elf to be carried by tho&s;e who would not follow Him, and &s;o con|tinued
<PB N="355" REF="4040">
in the head of tho&s;e who made the mo&s;t de&s;perate Propo&s;itions.</P>
<P>IN the pro&s;ecution of the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> his Carriage and Lan|guage was &s;uch as expre&s;s'd much per&s;onal Animo&s;ity; and he was ac|cu&s;ed of having practiced &s;ome Arts in it not worthy a good Man; as an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Man of very mean and low condition afterwards acknow|ledged, that being brought to him, as an Evidence of one part of the Charge again&s;t the Lord Lieutenant, in a particular of which a Per|&s;on of &s;o vile Quality would not be rea&s;onably thought a competent Informer; M^r <HI>Pym</HI> gave him Money to buy him a Sattin Suite and Cloak; in which Equipage he appear'd at the Tryal, and gave his Evi|dence; which if true, may make many other things which were con|fidently <MILESTONE N="10"> reported afterwards of him, to be believ'd; as that he receiv'd a great Sum of Money from the <HI>French</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour (which hath been before mention'd) to hinder the Tran&s;portation of tho&s;e Regi|ments of <HI>Ireland</HI> into <HI>Flanders,</HI> upon the disbanding that Army there; which had been prepared by the Earl of <HI>Strafford</HI> for the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Scotland;</HI> in which if his Maje&s;ties directions and commands had not been diverted, and contradicted, by the Hou&s;es, man do believe the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland</HI> had not happen'd.</P>
<P>CERTAIN it is, that his power of doing &s;hrewd turns was extra|ordinary, and no le&s;s in doing good Offices for particular Per&s;ons; and <MILESTONE N="20"> that he did pre&s;erve many from cen&s;ure, who were under the &s;evere di&s;plea&s;ure of the Hou&s;es, and looked upon as eminent Delinquents; and the Quality of many of them made it believ'd, that he had &s;old that protection for valuable con&s;iderations. From the time of his be|ing accu&s;ed of High Trea&s;on by the King, with the Lord <HI>Kimbolton,</HI> and the other Members, he never entertain'd thoughts of moderation, but allways oppo&s;ed all Overtures of Peace, and Accommodation; and when the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was di&s;po&s;ed, the la&s;t Summer, by tho&s;e Lords to an inclination towards a Treaty, as is before remember'd, M^r <HI>Pym</HI>'s power and dexterity wholely changed him, and wrought him to that <MILESTONE N="30"> temper, which he afterwards &s;werv'd not from. He was wonderfully &s;ollicitous for the <HI>Scots</HI> coming in to their A&s;&s;i&s;tance, though his in|di&s;po&s;ition of body was &s;o great, that it might well have made another impre&s;&s;ion upon his mind. During his &s;ickne&s;s, he was a very &s;ad Spe|ctacle; but none being admitted to him, who had not concurr'd with him, it is not known what his la&s;t thoughts, and con&s;iderations were. He died towards the end of <HI>December,</HI> before the <HI>Scots</HI> enter'd; and was buried with wonderful Pomp and Magnificence, in that place where the Bones of our <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Kings and Princes are committed to <MILESTONE N="40"> their re&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Arrival of the Prince Elector at <HI>London</HI> was no le&s;s the di&s;|cour&s;e of all Tongues, than the death of M^r <HI>Pym.</HI> He had been in <HI>England</HI> before the Troubles, and was receiv'd and cheri&s;h'd by the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince E|lector Arrives at</HI> London.</NOTE> with great demon&s;tration of grace and kindne&s;s, and &s;upplied with a Pen&s;ion of twelve thou&s;and pounds &s;terling yearly. When the King left <HI>London,</HI> he attended his Maje&s;ty to <HI>York,</HI> and re&s;ided there with him till the differences grew &s;o high, that his Maje&s;ty found it nece&s;&s;ary to re&s;olve to rai&s;e an Army for his Defence. Then, on the &s;uddain, with|out giving the King many days notice of his re&s;olution, that Prince left the Court; and taking the opportunity of an ordinary Ve&s;&s;el, em|barked him&s;elf for <HI>Holland,</HI> to the wonder of all Men; who thought

it an un&s;ea&s;onable Declaration of his fear at lea&s;t of the Parliament, and his de&s;ire of being well e&s;teem'd by them, when it was evident They e&s;teem'd not the King as they &s;hould. And this was the more &s;poken of, when it was afterwards known that the Parliament expre&s;&s;ed a good Sen&s;e of his having de&s;erted the King, and imputed it to his Con&s;cience, <Q>&startq;that he knew of &s;ome &s;uch de&s;igns of his Maje&s;ty, as he could not&endq; comply with.</Q> At this time, after many loud di&s;cour&s;es of his coming (which were derived to <HI>Oxford,</HI> as &s;omewhat that might have an In|fluence upon his Maje&s;ties Coun&s;els, there being then &s;everal whi&s;pers of &s;ome high proceedings they intended again&s;t the King) he arrived at <HI>London,</HI> and was receiv'd with Ceremony; Lodged in <HI>White-Hall,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> and Order taken for the payment of that Pen&s;ion which had been for|merly a&s;&s;ign'd to him by his Maje&s;ty; and a particular direction by both Hou&s;es, <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould be admitted to &s;it in the A&s;&s;embly of&endq; Divines;</Q> where, after he had taken the Covenant, he was contented to be often pre&s;ent: of all which the King took no other notice, than &s;ometimes to expre&s;s, <Q>&startq;that he was &s;orry on his Nephews behalf, that&endq; he thought fit to declare &s;uch a compliance.</Q></P>
<P>THE Defeat of Colonel <HI>John Bella&s;is</HI> at <HI>Selby</HI> by S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> and the de&s;truction of all the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiments under the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> together with the terror of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, had &s;o let loo&s;e all the <MILESTONE N="20"> King's Enemies in the Northern parts, which were lately at the King's Devotion, that his Friends were in great di&s;tre&s;s in all places before the Sea&s;on was ripe to take the Field.

To &s;end a Body from <HI>Oxford</HI> was very hazardous, and the Enemy &s;o &s;trong, as they would quickly follow; &s;o that there was no hope but from <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and <HI>Chester,</HI> where Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had given &s;o much life to tho&s;e parts, and drawn &s;o con&s;iderable a Body together, that the Enemy found little advantage by their late Victory, in the enlargement of their Quarters. His Highne&s;s then re&s;olv'd to try what he could do for <HI>Newark,</HI> and undertook it before he was ready for it, and thereby perform'd it. For the Enemy, who had all|ways excellent Intelligence, was &s;o confident that he had not a &s;trength <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;ufficient to attempt that work, that he was within &s;ix miles of them, before they believ'd he thought of them; and Charging and Routing &s;ome of their Hor&s;e, pur&s;ued them with that expedition, that he Be|&s;ieged them in their own Intrenchment, with his Hor&s;e, before his Foot came within four miles. In that con&s;ternation, they concluding that he mu&s;t have a va&s;t power and &s;trength, to bring them into tho&s;e &s;treights, He, with a Number inferior to the Enemy, and utter$$ unaccommo|dated for an Action of time, brought them to accept of $eave to depart, that is to disband, without their Armes, or any Carriage or Baggage. Thus he reliev'd <HI>Newark,</HI> and took above four thou&s;and Armes, eleven <MILESTONE N="20"> pieces of Bra&s;s Cannon, two Mortar pieces, and above fifty Barrels of Powder; which was as unexpected a Victory, as any happen'd through|out the War.

<P>_AS the Winter had been very unpro&s;perous, and un&s;ucce&s;sful to the King, in the diminution and lo&s;s of tho&s;e Forces, upon which he chiefly depended to &s;u&s;tain the power of the Enemy the year en&s;uing; &s;o the Spring enter'd with no better pre&s;age. When both Armies had en|ter'd into their Winter Quarters, to refre&s;h them&s;elves after &s;o much fatigue, the great preparation that was made at <HI>London,</HI> and the fame of &s;ending S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> into the <MILESTONE N="$0"> We&s;t, put the King upon the re&s;olution of having &s;uch a Body in his way, as might give him interruption, without Prince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s being di&s;turbed in his Siege of <HI>Plymouth;</HI> which was not thought to be able to make long re&s;i&s;tance. To this purpo&s;e, the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> was ap|pointed to Command an Army apart, to be levied out of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and tho&s;e We&s;tern Counties adjacent newly reduced; where his Reputation and Intere&s;t was very great; and by it he had in a &s;hort time rai&s;ed a pretty Body of Foot and Hor&s;e; to which receiving an Addition of two very good Regiments (though not many in Num|ber) out of <HI>Munster,</HI> under the Command of S^r <HI>Charles Vava&s;our,</HI> and S^r <HI>John Pawlet,</HI> and a good Troop of Hor&s;e under the Command of Captain <HI>Bridges,</HI> all which had been tran&s;ported, according to former
<PB N="362" REF="4110">
Orders, out of <HI>Ireland</HI> to <HI>Bristol,</HI> &s;ince the Ce&s;&s;ation, that Lord ad|vanced to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and &s;hortly after to <HI>Winche&s;ter;</HI> whither S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> brought him two Regiments more of Foot, rai&s;ed by him in <HI>Devon-&s;hire;</HI> &s;o that he had in all, at lea&s;t, three thou&s;and Foot, and about fifteen hundred Hor&s;e; which, in &s;o good a Po&s;t as <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> was, would in a &s;hort time have grown to a con&s;iderable Army; and was at pre&s;ent &s;trong enough to have &s;topped, or attended <HI>Waller</HI> in his We&s;tern Expedition; nor did He expect to have found &s;uch an ob|&s;truction in his way. And therefore, when he was upon his March, and was informed of the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s being at <HI>Winchester</HI> with &s;uch a &s;trength, he retired to <HI>Farnham;</HI> and Quarter'd there, till he gave his <MILESTONE N="10"> Ma&s;ters an Account that he wanted other Supplies.</P>
<P>IT was a general misfortune, and mi&s;computation of that time, that the Party, in all places, that wi&s;h'd well to the King (which con&s;i&s;ted of mo&s;t of the Gentry in mo&s;t Counties; and for the pre&s;ent were aw'd, and kept under by the Militia, and the Committees of Parliament) had &s;o good an opinion of their own Reputation and Intere&s;t, that they be|liev'd they were able, upon the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of few Troops, to &s;uppre&s;s their Neighbours who were of the other Party, and who, upon the ad|vantage of the power they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, exerci&s;ed their Authority <MILESTONE N="20"> over them with great rigour, and in&s;olence. And &s;o the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> was no &s;ooner po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Winchester,</HI> where S^r <HI>William Ogle</HI> had like|wi&s;e &s;ei&s;ed upon the Ca&s;tle for the King, and put it into a tenable con|dition, than the Gentlemen of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and of the adjacent parts of <HI>Hamp&s;hire,</HI> &s;ent privately to him, <Q>&startq;that if he would advance into Their Country, they would undertake, in a &s;hort time, to make great Le|vies of Men for the recruit of his Army; and likewi&s;e to po&s;&s;e&s;s them|&s;elves of &s;uch places as they &s;hould be well able to defend; and thereby&endq; keep that part of the Country in the King's Obedience.</Q></P>
<P>S^r <HI>Edward Ford,</HI> a Gentleman of a good Family, and fair Fortune <MILESTONE N="$0"> in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> had then a Regiment of Hor&s;e in the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s Troops, and the King had made him High Sheriff of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> that year, to the end that, if there were occa&s;ion, he might the better make impre&s;&s;ion upon that County. He had with him, in his Regiment, many of the Gentlemen of that County of good Quality: And they all be&s;ought the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> <Q>&startq;that he would, &s;ince <HI>Waller</HI> was not like to advance, at lea&s;t &s;end &s;ome Troops into tho&s;e parts, to give a little Countenance&endq; to the Levies they &s;hould be well able to make;</Q> a&s;&s;uring him, <Q>&startq;that they would, in the fir&s;t place, &s;ei&s;e upon <HI>Arundel-</HI>Ca&s;tle; which, &s;tanding near the Sea, would yeild great advantage to the King's Ser|vice, and keep that rich Corner of the Country at his Maje&s;ties De|votion.&endq;</Q> The&s;e, and many other &s;pecious undertakings, di&s;po&s;ed the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> who had an extraordinary appetite to engage <HI>Waller</HI> in a Battle, upon old accounts, to wi&s;h him&s;elf at Liberty to comply with tho&s;e Gentlemens de&s;ires: of all which, he gave &s;uch an Account to the King, as made it appear, that he liked the de&s;ign, and thought it pra|cticable, if he had an addition of a Regiment or two of Foot, under good Officers; for that Quarter of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> which he meant to vi&s;it, was a fa&s;t and inclo&s;ed Country, and <HI>Arundel-</HI>Ca&s;tle had a Garri&s;on in it, though not numerous, or well provided, as being without apprehen&s;ion of an Enemy.</P>
<P>IT was about Chri&s;tmas, and the King had no farther de&s;ign for the Winter, than to keep <HI>Waller</HI> from vi&s;iting and di&s;turbing the We&s;t, and
<PB N="363" REF="4120">
to recruit his Army to &s;uch a degree as to be able to take the Field early; which he knew the Rebels re&s;olv'd to do: yet the good Po&s;t the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> was already po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of at <HI>Winchester,</HI> and the&s;e po&s;itive undertakings from <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> wrought upon many to think, that this op|portunity &s;hould not be lo&s;t. The King had likewi&s;e great A&s;&s;urance of the general good Affections of the County of <HI>Kent;</HI> in&s;omuch as the People had with difficulty been re&s;train'd from making &s;ome attempt, upon the confidence of their own &s;trength; and if there could be now &s;uch a foundation laid, that there might be a conjunction between that and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> it might produce an A&s;&s;ociation little inferior to that of the Southern Counties under the Earl of <HI>Manchester;</HI> and might, by <MILESTONE N="10"> the Spring, be an occa&s;ion of that di&s;traction to the Parliament, that they &s;hould not well know to what part to di&s;po&s;e their Armies; and the King might apply his own to that part, and purpo&s;e, as &s;hould &s;eem mo&s;t rea&s;onable to him.</P>
<P>THESE, and other rea&s;ons prevailing, the King gave the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> order to pro&s;ecute his de&s;ign upon <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> in &s;uch man$er as he thought fit; provided, that he was well a&s;&s;ured, that <HI>Waller</HI> &s;hould not make advantage, upon that Enterpri&s;e, to find the way open to him to march into the We&s;t. And that he might be the better able to pro&s;ecute the <MILESTONE N="20"> one, and to provide for the other, S^r <HI>Jacob Astley</HI> was likewi&s;e &s;ent to him from <HI>Reading,</HI> with a thou&s;and commanded Men of that Garri&s;on, <HI>Wallingford,</HI> and <HI>Oxford;</HI> which &s;upply no &s;ooner arrived at <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> but the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> re&s;olv'd to vi&s;it <HI>Waller</HI>'s Quarters, if it were po&s;|&s;ible to engage him; however that he might judge by the po&s;ture he was in, whether he were like to pur&s;ue his purpo&s;e for the We&s;t. <HI>Waller</HI> was then Quarter'd at <HI>Farnham,</HI> and the Villages adjacent, from whence he drew out his Men, and faced the Enemy, as if he intended to Fight, but, after &s;ome light Skirmi&s;hes for a day or two, in which he allways receiv'd lo&s;s, he retired him&s;elf into the Ca&s;tle of <HI>Farnham,</HI> a place of &s;ome &s;trength; and drew his Army into the Town; and within three <MILESTONE N="30"> or four days, went him&s;elf to <HI>London,</HI> more effectually to &s;ollicite Re|cruits, than his Letters had been able to do.</P>
<P>WHEN the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> &s;aw that he could attempt no farther upon tho&s;e Troops, and was fully a&s;&s;ured that S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> was him|&s;elf gone to <HI>London,</HI> he concluded, that it was a good time to comply with the importunity of the Gentlemen of <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> and marched thi|ther, with &s;uch a Body of Hor&s;e and Foot, as he thought competent for the Service. The exceeding hard Fro&s;t made his march more ea&s;y through tho&s;e deep dirty ways, than better Weather would have done; and he came to <HI>Arundel</HI> before there was any imagination that he had that place in his pro&s;pect. The place in it's Situation was &s;trong; and though the Fortifications were not regular, but of the old fa&s;hion, yet the Walls were good, and the Graff broad, and deep; and though the Garri&s;on was not numerous enough to have defended all the large cir|cuit again&s;t a powerful Army, yet it was &s;trong enough, in all re&s;pects, to have defied any &s;uddain A&s;&s;ault; and might, without putting them|&s;elves to much trouble, have been very &s;ecure again&s;t the Attempts of tho&s;e without. But the Provi&s;ions of Victual, or Ammunition, was not &s;ufficient to have endured any long Siege; and the Officer who Com|manded, had not been accu&s;tomed to the pro&s;pect of an Enemy. So upon an ea&s;y and &s;hort Summons, that threaten'd his ob&s;tinacy with a very rigorous cha&s;ti&s;ement, if he &s;hould defer the giving it up; either
<PB N="364" REF="4130">
from the effect of his own fear, and want of Courage, or from the good inclinations of &s;ome of the Soldiers, the Ca&s;tle was Surrender'd the third <NOTE PLACE="marg">Arundel<HI>-Ca|&s;tle Surren|der'd to the Lord</HI> Hop|ton:</NOTE> day; and appear'd to be a place worth the keeping, and capable, in a &s;hort time, to be made &s;ecure again&s;t a good Army.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> after he had &s;tayed there five or &s;ix days, and cau&s;ed Provi&s;ions of all kinds to be brought in, committed the Com|mand and Government thereof to S^r <HI>Edward Ford,</HI> High Sheriff of the County, with a Garri&s;on of above two hundred Men; be&s;ides many good Officers; who de&s;ired, or were very willing, to &s;tay there; as a place very favourable for the making Levies of Men, which they all intended. <MILESTONE N="10"> And, it may be, the more remained there, out of the wearine&s;s and &s;a|tigue of their late marches, and that they might &s;pend the remainder of the Winter with better Accommodation.</P>
<P>THE News of S^r <HI>William Waller</HI>'s return to <HI>Farnham</HI> with &s;trong recruits of Hor&s;e and Foot, made it nece&s;&s;ary to the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> to leave <HI>Arundel-</HI>Ca&s;tle before he had put it into the good po&s;ture he in|tended. And, without well con&s;idering the mixture of the Men he left there, whereof many were of Natures not ea&s;y to be govern'd, nor like to conform them&s;elves to &s;uch &s;trict Rules as the condition of the place required, or to u&s;e that indu&s;try, as the exigence, they were like to be <MILESTONE N="20"> in, made nece&s;&s;ary, the principal thing he recommended and enjoyn'd to them was, <Q>&startq;in the fir&s;t place, &s;etting all other things a&s;ide, to draw in &s;tore of Provi&s;ions of all kinds, both for the Numbers they were already, and for &s;uch as would probably in a &s;hort time be added to&endq; them;</Q> all which from the great plenty that Country then abounded in, was very ea&s;y to have been done. And if it had been done, that place would have remain'd long &s;uch a Thorn in the &s;ide of the Parlia|ment, as would have render'd it very unea&s;y to them, at lea&s;t have in|terrupted the current of their pro&s;perity.</P>
<P>WALLER'S Journey to <HI>London</HI> an&s;wer'd his expectation; and his <MILESTONE N="30"> pre&s;ence had an extraordinary operation, to procure any thing de&s;ired. He reported the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s Forces to be much greater than they were, that his own might be made proportionable to encounter them. And the quick progre&s;s that Lord had made in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and his taking <HI>Arundel-</HI>Ca&s;tle, made them thought to be greater than He reported them to be. His &s;o ea&s;ily po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of a place of that &s;trength, which they &s;uppo&s;ed to have been impregnable, and in a County where the King had before no footing, awaken'd all their Jealou&s;ies and Ap|prehen&s;ions of the Affections of <HI>Kent,</HI> and all other places; and looked like a Land-flood, that might roll they knew not how far; &s;o that <MILESTONE N="40"> there needed no importunate &s;ollicitation to provide a remedy again&s;t this growing evil. The ordinary method they had u&s;ed for recruiting their Armies, by Levies of Volunteers, and per&s;wading the Appren|tices of the City to become Soldiers, upon the Priviledge they gave them for their freedom, for the time they fought for them, as if they had remained in their Ma&s;ter's Service, was now too dull and lazy an expedient to re&s;i&s;t this Torrent; they therefore re&s;ort to their inex|hau&s;tible Magazine of Men, their devoted City, to who&s;e Affections the Per&s;on of S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> was mo&s;t acceptable; and per&s;waded them, immediately to cau&s;e two of their &s;tronge&s;t Regiments of Auxiliaries, <MILESTONE N="50"> to march out of the Line to <HI>Farnham;</HI> which they con&s;ented to. Then they appointed the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to give his Orders to S^r <HI>William Bal|four,</HI> with one thou&s;and of the Hor&s;e of his Army, likewi&s;e to ob|&s;erve

<HI>Waller</HI>'s Commands; who, with this great addition of Forces, made ha&s;t to his other Troops at <HI>Farnham;</HI> where he &s;carce re&s;ted, but after he had informed him&s;elf how the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s Troops lay Quar|ter'd, at too great a di&s;tance from each other, he marched, according to his cu&s;tom in tho&s;e occa&s;ions (as beating up of Quarters was his Ma&s;ter-piece) all the night; and, by the break of day, encompa&s;s'd a great Village called <HI>Alton,</HI> where a Troop or two of Hor&s;e, and a Regi|ment of Foot of the King's lay in too much &s;ecurity. However, the Hor&s;e took the Alarm quickly, and, for the mo&s;t part, made their e&s;cape to <HI>Winchester,</HI> the head Quarter; whither the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> was re|turn'd <MILESTONE N="10"> but the night before from <HI>Arundel.</HI> Colonel <HI>Boles,</HI> who Com|manded his own Regiment of Foot there, con&s;i&s;ting of about five hun|dred Men, which had been drawn out of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Wallingford,</HI> when he found him&s;elf encompa&s;s'd by the Enemies Army of Hor&s;e and Foot, &s;aw he could not defend him&s;elf, or make other re&s;i&s;tance than by retiring with his Men into the Church, which he hoped to maintain for &s;o many hours, that relief might be &s;ent to him; but he had not time to Barricadoe the doors; &s;o that the Enemy enter'd all|mo&s;t a&s;&s;oon, and after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance, in which many were killed, the Soldiers, overpower'd, threw down their Armes, and asked Quarter; <MILESTONE N="20"> which was likewi&s;e offer'd to the Colonel; who refu&s;ed it, and valiantly defended him&s;elf, till, with the death of two or three of the A&s;&s;ailants, he was killed in the place; his Enemies giving him a te&s;timony of great Courage and Re&s;olution.</P>
<P>WALLER knew well the impre&s;&s;ion the lo&s;s of this very good Regi|ment would make upon the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s Forces, and that the report which the Troops of Hor&s;e which had e&s;caped, would make, would add nothing of Courage to their fellows; &s;o that there was no probability that they would make ha&s;t to advance; and therefore, with great cele|rity, the hard Fro&s;t continuing, he marched with all his Army to <HI>Arun|del-</HI>Ca&s;tle, <MILESTONE N="$0"> where he found that Garri&s;on as unprovided as he could wi&s;h. For in&s;tead of encrea&s;ing the Magazine of Victual by Supplies from the Country, they had &s;pent much of that &s;tore which the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> had provided. The Governour was a Man of Hone&s;ty and Courage, but unacquainted with that Affair, having no other experience in War, than what he had learn'd &s;ince the&s;e Troubles. The Officers were many without Command, among&s;t whom one Colonel <HI>Bamford,</HI> an <HI>Iri&s;h-</HI>man, though he called him&s;elf <HI>Bamfield,</HI> was one; who, being a Man of wit and parts, applied all his faculties to improve the Faction, to which they were all naturally inclined, with a hope to make him&s;elf Gover|nour. <MILESTONE N="$0"> In this di&s;traction <HI>Waller</HI> found them, and by &s;ome of the Sol|diers running out to him, he found means again to &s;end in to them; by which he &s;o encrea&s;ed their Faction, and Animo&s;ity again&s;t one an|other, that, after he had kept them waking, with continual Alarms, three or four days, near half the Men being &s;ick, and unable to do duty, rather than they would tru&s;t each other longer, they gave the Place and Them&s;elves up, as Pri&s;oners of War upon Quarter; the place being able <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>It is retaken by S^r</HI> William Waller.</NOTE> to have defended it &s;elf again&s;t all that power, for a much longer time. Here the Learned and Eminent M^r <HI>Chillingworth</HI> was taken Pri&s;oner; who, out of kindne&s;s and re&s;pect to the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> had accompanied <MILESTONE N="$0"> him in that ma$ch; and, being indi&s;po&s;ed by the terrible coldne&s;s of the Sea&s;on, cho&s;e to repo&s;e him&s;elf in that Garri&s;on, till the Weather &s;hould mend. A&s;&s;oon as his Per&s;on was known, which would have drawn

reverence from any noble Enemy, the Clergy that attended that Army, pro&s;ecuted him with all the inhumanity imaginable; &s;o that, by their Barbarous u&s;age, he died within few days; to the grief of all that knew him, and of many who knew him not but by his Book, and the Repu|tation he had with Learned Men.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> &s;u&s;tain'd the lo&s;s of that Regiment with extraor|dinary trouble of mind, and as a wound that would bleed inward; and therefore was the more inflamed with de&s;ire of a Battle with <HI>Waller,</HI> to make even all Accounts; and made what ha&s;t he could, upon the fir&s;t adverti&s;ement, to have redeemed that misfortune; and hoped to have come time enough to relieve <HI>Arundel-</HI>Ca&s;tle; which he never &s;u&s;pected <MILESTONE N="10"> would &s;o tamely have given them&s;elves up: But that hope quickly va|ni&s;h'd, upon the undoubted Intelligence of that Surrender, and the News that <HI>Waller</HI> was return'd with a full re&s;olution to pro&s;ecute his de&s;ign upon the We&s;t: to which, be&s;ides the encouragement of his two late &s;ucce&s;&s;es, with which he was marvellou&s;ly elated, he was in &s;ome degree nece&s;&s;itated, out of apprehen&s;ion that the Hor&s;e which belonged to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army, might be &s;peedily recalled; and the time would be quickly expired, that he had promi&s;ed the Auxiliary Regi|ments of <HI>London</HI> to di&s;mi&s;s them.</P>
<P>UPON the News the King receiv'd of the great &s;upply the Parlia|ment <MILESTONE N="$0"> had &s;o &s;uddainly &s;ent to <HI>Waller,</HI> both from the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> his Army, and from the City, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end &s;uch an ad|dition of Foot as he could draw out of <HI>Oxford,</HI> and the neighbour Gar|ri&s;ons. And the Earl of <HI>Brentford,</HI> General of the Army, who had a fa&s;t friend&s;hip with the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> expre&s;&s;ing a good inclination to make him a vi&s;it, rather than to &s;it &s;till in his Winter Quarters, his Ma|je&s;ty was very willing he &s;hould, and cheri&s;hed that di&s;po&s;ition, being de&s;irous that &s;o great an Officer might be pre&s;ent in an Army, upon which &s;o much of his hopes depended; and which did not abound with Officers of great experience. So the General, with &s;uch Volunteers as <MILESTONE N="30"> were ready to accompany him, went to <HI>Winchester;</HI> where he found the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> in trouble for the lo&s;s of the Regiment of Foot at <HI>Alton,</HI> and with the unexpected A&s;&s;urance of the giving up of <HI>Arundel-</HI>Ca&s;tle. He was exceedingly revived with the pre&s;ence of the General, and de&s;ired to receive his Orders, and that he would take upon him the ab&s;olute Command of the Troops; which he as po&s;itively refu&s;ed to do; only offer'd to keep him company in all expeditions, and to give him the be&s;t a&s;&s;i&s;tance he was able; which the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> was compelled to be contented with; nor could there be a greater union and con&s;ent <MILESTONE N="$0"> between two Friends: The General being ready to give his advice upon all particulars; and the other doing nothing without communication with him, and then conforming to his opinion, and giving Orders ac|cordingly.</P>
<P>ASSOON as they were informed that <HI>Waller</HI> had drawn all his Troops together about <HI>Farnham,</HI> and meant to march towards them, they chearfully embraced the occa&s;ion, and went to meet him; and about <HI>Alresford,</HI> near the midway between <HI>Winchester</HI> and <HI>Farnham,</HI> they came to know how near they were to each other; and, being in View, cho&s;e the ground upon which they meant the Battle &s;hould be Fought; <MILESTONE N="$0"> of which <HI>Waller,</HI> being fir&s;t there, got the advantage for the drawing up his Hor&s;e. The King's Army con&s;i&s;ted of about five thou&s;and Foot, and three thou&s;and Hor&s;e; and <HI>Waller</HI> with S^r <HI>William Balfour,</HI> ex|ceeded
<PB N="367" REF="4170">
in Hor&s;e; but they were upon the matter equal in Foot; with this only advantage, that both his Hor&s;e and Foot were, as they were allways, much better Arm'd; no Man wanting any Weapon Offen&s;ive, or Defen&s;ive, that was proper for him; and S^r <HI>Arthur Ha&s;lerig</HI>'s Regi|ment of Cuira&s;&s;iers, called the <HI>Lob&s;ters,</HI> were &s;o formidable, that the King's naked and unarmed Troops, among which few were better arm'd than with Swords, could not bear their impre&s;&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE King's Hor&s;e never behaved them&s;elves &s;o ill, as that day. For <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battle at</HI> Alres&s;ord, <HI>where S^r</HI> Wil|liam Waller <HI>had the ad|vantage over the Lord</HI> Hopton.</NOTE> the main Body of them, after they had &s;u&s;tained one fierce Charge, wheeled about to an unrea&s;onable di&s;tance; and left their principal Of|ficers <MILESTONE N="10"> to &s;hift for them&s;elves. The Foot behaved them&s;elves very gal|lantly, and had not only the better of the other Foot, but bore two or three Charges from the Hor&s;e with notable Courage, and without being broken; whil&s;t tho&s;e Hor&s;e which &s;tood upon the Field, and &s;hould have a&s;&s;i&s;ted them, could be per&s;waded but to &s;tand. When the Even|ing drew near, for the approach whereof neither Part$ was &s;orry, the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> thought it nece&s;&s;ary to leave the Field; and drawing off his Men, and carrying with him many of the wounded, he retired with all his Cannon and Ammunition, whereof he lo&s;t none, that night to <HI>Reading:</HI> the Enemy being &s;o &s;catter'd, that they had no mind to pur|&s;ue; <MILESTONE N="$0"> only <HI>Waller</HI> him&s;elf made ha&s;t to <HI>Winchester,</HI> where he thought, upon this Succe&s;s, to have been immediately admitted into that Ca&s;tle; which was his own Inheritance. But he found that too well defended; and &s;o return'd with taking revenge upon the City, by plundering it with all the in&s;olence and rapine imaginable.</P>
<P>THERE could not then be any other e&s;timate made of the lo&s;s <HI>Waller</HI> &s;u&s;tained, than by the not pur&s;uing the vi&s;ible advantage he had, and by the utter refu&s;al of the Auxiliary Regiments of <HI>London</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> to march farther; who, within three or four days, left him; and return'd to their Habitations, with great Lamentation of their Friends who were <MILESTONE N="$0"> mi&s;&s;ing. On the King's &s;ide, be&s;ides common Men, and many good Of|ficers, there fell that day the Lord <HI>John Stuart,</HI> Brother to the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and General of the Hor&s;e of that Army; and S^r <HI>John Smith,</HI> Brother to the Lord <HI>Carrington,</HI> and Commi&s;&s;ary General of the Hor&s;e. They were both brought off the Field by the few Hor&s;e that &s;tay'd with them, and did their duty; carried to <HI>Reading;</HI> and the next day to <HI>Abingdon,</HI> that they might be nearer to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the be&s;t reme|dies by Phy&s;icians and Surgeons. But they lived only to the &s;econd dre&s;|&s;ing of their wounds; which were very many upon both of them.</P>
<P>THE former was a young Man of extraordinary hope, little more <MILESTONE N="$0"> than one and twenty years of Age; who being of a more cholerick and rough Nature, than the other Branches of that illu&s;trious and princely Family, was not delighted with the &s;oftne&s;&s;es of the Court, but had dedicated him&s;elf to the profe&s;&s;ion of Armes, when he did not think the Scene &s;hould have been in his own Country. His Courage was &s;o &s;ignal that day, that too much could not be expected from it, if he had out lived it; and he was &s;o generally beloved, that he could not but be very generally lamented. The other, S^r <HI>John Smith,</HI> had been train'd up from his youth in the War of <HI>Flanders;</HI> being of an Ancient Ro|man Catholick Family; and had long the Reputation of one of the be&s;t <MILESTONE N="$0"> Officers of Hor&s;e. A&s;&s;oon as the fir&s;t Troubles appear'd in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he betook him&s;elf to the Service of his own Prince; and from the be|ginning of the War to his own end, performed many &s;ignal Actions of
<PB N="368" REF="4180">
Courage. The death of the&s;e two eminent Officers, made the names of many who peri&s;h'd that day, the le&s;s inquired into and mention'd.</P>
<P>THIS Battle was Fought the 29^t^h day of <HI>March;</HI> which was a very doleful entring into the beginning of the year 1644, and broke all the mea&s;ures, and alter'd the whole &s;cheme of the King's Coun&s;els: for whereas before, he hoped to have enter'd the Field early, and to have acted an Offen&s;ive part; he now di&s;cerned, he was wholely to be upon the Defen&s;ive; and that was like to be a very hard part too. For he found, within very few days after, that he was not only deprived of the Men he had lo&s;t at <HI>Alresford,</HI> but that he was not to expect any re|cruit of his Army by a conjunction with Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> who, he be|liev'd, <MILESTONE N="10"> would have return'd in time, after his great Succe&s;s at <HI>Newark,</HI> with a &s;trong Body both of Hor&s;e and Foot, from <HI>Shrop&s;hire, Che&s;hire,</HI> and North <HI>Wales:</HI> all which hopes were &s;oon bla&s;ted; for the Prince had &s;carce put the Garri&s;on of <HI>Newark</HI> in Order, and provided it to endure another Attack, which they might have rea&s;onably expected upon his Highne&s;s's departure (though indeed the &s;hame of the defeat he had given that Party, and the rage among the Officers, and Soldiers, when they &s;aw by what a handful of Men they had been terrified, and &s;ub|dued, broke and di&s;&s;olv'd that whole Body within few days) when he <MILESTONE N="$0"> was earne&s;tly pre&s;s'd from the Earl of <HI>Derby,</HI> to come into <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> to relieve him, who was already Be&s;ieged in his own &s;trong Hou&s;e at <HI>Latham,</HI> by a great Body, with whom he was not able to contend. And to di&s;po&s;e the Prince the more willingly to undertake his relief, the Earl made ample promi&s;es, <Q>&startq;that within &s;o many days after the Siege &s;hould be rai&s;ed, with any defeat to the Enemy, he would advance his Highne&s;s's Levies with two thou&s;and Men, and &s;upply him with&endq; a con&s;iderable Sum of Money.</Q> And the Earl had likewi&s;e, by an Ex|pre&s;s, made the &s;ame in&s;tance to the King at <HI>Oxford;</HI> from whence his Maje&s;ty &s;ent his Permi&s;&s;ion, and Approbation to the Prince, before his <MILESTONE N="$0"> departure from <HI>Newark;</HI> hoping &s;till that his Highne&s;s would be able to di&s;patch that Service in <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and with the more notable re|cruits of Men in tho&s;e parts, be able to return to <HI>Oxford</HI> by the time that it would be nece&s;&s;ary for his Maje&s;ty to take the Field. But within a &s;hort time, he was di&s;appointed of that expectation; for before the Prince could fini&s;h his Expedition into <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> (which he did with wonderful Gallantry; rai&s;ed the Siege at <HI>Latham</HI> with a great execution upon the Enemy; and took two or three of their Garri&s;ons, ob&s;tinately defended; and therefore with the greater &s;laughter) the Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> was compelled to retire, with his whole Army, within the <MILESTONE N="$0"> Walls of <HI>York.</HI> He had been well able to have defended him&s;elf again&s;t the numerous Army of the <HI>Scots,</HI> and would have been glad to have been engaged with them, but he found he had a wor&s;e Enemy to deal with, as will appear.</P>
<P>FROM the time that the ruling Party of the Parliament di&s;cern'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The A&s;&s;ocia|tion of &s;eve|ral Counties form'd under the Earl of</HI> Manche&s;ter.</NOTE> that their General, the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> would never &s;erve their turn, or comply with all their de&s;ires, they re&s;olv'd to have another Army apart, that &s;hould be more at their devotion; in the forming whereof, they would be &s;ure to choo&s;e &s;uch Officers, as would probably not only ob|&s;erve their Orders, but have the &s;ame inclinations with them. Their <MILESTONE N="50"> pretence was, <Q>&startq;that there were &s;o many di&s;affected Per&s;ons of the No|bility, and Principal Gentry, in the Counties of <HI>Norfolk</HI> and <HI>Suffolk,</HI> that, if great care was not taken to prevent it, there might a Body
<PB N="369" REF="4190">
&s;tart up there for the King; which, upon the &s;ucce&s;s of the Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> who&s;e Armes then reached into <HI>Lincoln-&s;hire,</HI> might&endq; grow very formidable.</Q> For prevention whereof, they had formed an A&s;&s;ociation between <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> (a County, upon the influence of the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and the power of his Clergy, they mo&s;t confided in) <HI>Cam|bridge-&s;hire, Suffolk, Norfolk, Bedford,</HI> and <HI>Huntington;</HI> in all which they had many Per&s;ons of who&s;e entire Affections they were well a&s;|&s;ured; and, in mo&s;t of them, there were few con&s;iderable Per&s;ons who wi&s;hed them ill. Of this A&s;&s;ociation they had made the Earl of <HI>Man|che&s;ter</HI> General, to be &s;ubject only to their own Commands, and inde|pendent <MILESTONE N="10"> upon the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> Under Him, they cho&s;e <HI>Oliver Crom|well</HI> to command their Hor&s;e; and many other Officers, who never in|tended to be &s;ubject again to the King, and avowed other Principles in Con&s;cience and Religion, than had been before publickly declared.</P>
<P>TO this General they gave Order, <Q>&startq;to re&s;ide within that A&s;&s;ociation; and to make Levies of Men, &s;ufficient to keep tho&s;e Counties in obe|dience:&endq;</Q> for at fir&s;t they pretended no more. But, in $he &s;ecret Treaty made by S^r <HI>Harry Vane</HI> with the <HI>Scots,</HI> they were bound, a&s;&s;oon as the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould enter into <HI>York-&s;hire</HI> with their Army, that a Body of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e, Foot, and Cannon, &s;hould be ready to a&s;&s;i&s;t them, Com|manded <MILESTONE N="20"> by their own Officers, as a Body apart: The <HI>Scots</HI> not then tru&s;ting their own great Numbers, as equal to fight with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> And from that time they were much more careful to rai&s;e, and libe|rally &s;upply, and provide for that Army under the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> than for the other under the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI> And now, according to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Manche&s;ter <HI>is order'd with his Army to march into the North to joyn the</HI> Scots.</NOTE> their agreement, upon the <HI>Scots</HI> fir&s;t entrance into <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> had likewi&s;e order to march with his whole Body thi|ther; having, for the mo&s;t part, a Committee of the Parliament, where|of S^r <HI>Harry Vane</HI> was one, with him; as there was another Committee of the <HI>Scoti&s;h</HI> Parliament allways in that Army; there being al&s;o now <MILESTONE N="30"> a Committee of both Kingdoms re&s;iding at <HI>London,</HI> for the carrying on the War.</P>
<P>THE Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> being thus pre&s;&s;ed on both &s;ides, was nece&s;&s;itated to draw all his Army of Foot and Cannon into <HI>York,</HI> with &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e; and &s;ent the Body of his Hor&s;e, under the Com|mand of General <HI>Goring,</HI> to remain in tho&s;e places he &s;hould find mo&s;t convenient, and from whence he might be&s;t infe&s;t the Enemy. Then he &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the King, to inform him of the condition he was in; and to let him know, <Q>&startq;that he doubted not to defend him&s;elf in that Po&s;t, for the term of &s;ix Weeks, or two Months; in which time,&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> he hoped,</Q> his Maje&s;ty would find &s;ome way to relieve him. Upon re|ceipt of this Letter, the King &s;ent Orders to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> <Q>that &startq;a&s;|&s;oon as he had reliev'd the Lord <HI>Derby,</HI> and recruited, and refre&s;hed his Men, he &s;hould march, with what expedition he could, to relieve <HI>York;</HI> where being joyn'd with the Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI>'s Army, there was hope they might fight the Enemy: and his Maje&s;ty would put him&s;elf into as good a po&s;ture as he could to take the Field, with|out&endq; expecting the Prince.</Q></P>
<P>ALL the&s;e ill Accidents falling out &s;ucce&s;&s;ively in the Winter, the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen re|tires from</HI> Oxford <HI>to</HI> Exeter.</NOTE> King's condition appear'd very &s;ad; and the Queen being now with <MILESTONE N="50"> Child, it wrought upon her Maje&s;ties mind very much; and di&s;po&s;ed her to &s;o many Fears and Apprehen&s;ions of her &s;afety, that &s;he was very unea&s;y to her &s;elf. <Q>She heard every day &startq;of the great Forces rai&s;ed, and
<PB N="370" REF="4200">
in a readine&s;s, by the Parliament, much greater than they yet ever&endq; had been;</Q> which was very true; <Q>and &startq;that they re&s;olv'd, a&s;&s;oon as&endq; the Sea&s;on was ripe,</Q> to march all to <HI>Oxford.</HI> She could not endure to think of being Be&s;ieged; and, in conclu&s;ion, re&s;olv'd not to &s;tay there, but to go into the We&s;t; from whence, in any di&s;tre&s;s, &s;he might be able to Embark for <HI>France.</HI> Though there &s;eem'd rea&s;ons enough to di&s;&s;wade her from that inclination, and his Maje&s;ty heartily wi&s;hed that &s;he could be diverted, yet the perplexity of her mind was &s;o great, and her fears &s;o vehement, both improved by her indi&s;po&s;ition of Health, that all civility and rea&s;on obliged every Body to &s;ubmit. So, about the be|ginning of <HI>April,</HI> &s;he begun her Journey from <HI>Oxford</HI> to the We&s;t; and, <MILESTONE N="10"> by moderate Journies, came well to <HI>Exeter;</HI> where &s;he intended to &s;tay, till &s;he was deliver'd; for &s;he was within little more than one Month of her time; and, being in a place out of the reach of any Alarm, &s;he recover'd her Spirits to a rea&s;onable convale&s;cence.</P>
<P>IT was now about the middle of <HI>April,</HI> when it concern'd the King with all po&s;&s;ible &s;agacity, to fore&s;ee what probably the Parliament meant to attempt with tho&s;e va&s;t Numbers of Men which they every day le|vied; and thereupon to conclude, what it would be po&s;&s;ible for his Ma|je&s;ty to do, in tho&s;e exigencies to which he was like to be reduced. The Intelligence, that <HI>Waller</HI> was &s;till de&s;ign'd for the We&s;tern expedition, <MILESTONE N="20"> made the King appoint his whole Army to be drawn together to a Ren|dezvous at <HI>Marlborough;</HI> where him&s;elf was pre&s;ent, and, to his great &s;atisfaction, found the Body to con&s;i&s;t, after all the lo&s;&s;es and mi&s;ad|ventures, of no le&s;s than &s;ix thou&s;and Foot, and above four thou&s;and Hor&s;e. There that Body remain'd for &s;ome weeks, to watch, and in|tend <HI>Waller</HI>'s motion, and to Fight with him a&s;&s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible. Many things were there con&s;ulted for the future; and the quitting <HI>Reading,</HI> and &s;ome other Garri&s;ons, propo&s;ed, for the encrea&s;ing the Field Forces: yet nothing was po&s;itively re&s;olv'd, but to expect clearer <MILESTONE N="$0"> evidence what the Parliament Armies would di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves to do.</P>
<P>SO the King return'd to <HI>Oxford,</HI> where, upon the de&s;ire of the Mem|bers <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Parlia|ment at</HI> Ox|ford <HI>Pro|rogued to</HI> October.</NOTE> of Parliament who had been called thither, and done all the Ser|vice they could for the King, they were for the pre&s;ent di&s;mi&s;&s;ed, that they might, in their &s;everal Counties, &s;atisfy the People of the King's importunate de&s;ire of Peace, but how in&s;olently it had been rejected by the Parliament; and thereupon induce them to contribute all they could to his Maje&s;ties A&s;&s;i&s;tance. They were to meet there again in the Month of <HI>October</HI> following.</P>
<P>THEN, that his Maje&s;ty might draw mo&s;t of the Soldiers of that Gar|ri&s;on <MILESTONE N="$0"> with him out of <HI>Oxford,</HI> when he &s;hould take the Field, that City was per&s;waded to compleat the Regiment they had begun to form, un|der the Command of a Colonel whom the King had recommended to them; which they did rai&s;e to the Number of a thou&s;and Men. There were likewi&s;e two other Regiments rai&s;ed of Gentlemen and their Ser|vants, and of the Scholars of the &s;everal Colleges and Halls of the Uni|ver&s;ity; all which Regiments did Duty there punctually, from the time that the King went into the Field, till he return'd again to <HI>Oxford;</HI> and all the Lords declared, <Q>&startq;that, upon any emergent occa&s;ion, they would mount their Servants upon their Hor&s;es, to make a good Troop$&endq; for a &s;uddain Service;</Q> which they made good; and thereby, that Sum|mer, perform'd two or three very con&s;iderable and important Actions.</P>
<P>BY this time there was rea&s;on to believe, by all the Intelligence that
<PB N="371" REF="4210">
could be procured, and by the change of his Quarters, that <HI>Waller</HI> had laid a&s;ide his We&s;tern March; at lea&s;t that it was &s;u&s;pended; and that, on the contrary, all endeavours were u&s;ed to recruit both His, and the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition; and that neither of them &s;hould move upon any Action till they &s;hould be both com|pleat in greater Numbers, than either of them had yet marched with. Hereupon, the King's Army removed from <HI>Marlborough</HI> to <HI>Newbury;</HI> where they remained near a Month, that they might be in a readine&s;s to attend the motion of the Enemy, and to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Reading,</HI> or <HI>Wallingford;</HI> or to draw out either, as there &s;hould be occa&s;ion. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THERE had been &s;everal deliberations in the Council of War, and allways very different opinions, what &s;hould be done with the Garri|&s;ons when the King &s;hould take the Field; and the King him&s;elf was irre&s;olute upon tho&s;e Debates, what to do. He communicated the &s;e|veral rea&s;ons to Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> by Letters, requiring His advice; who, after he had return'd An&s;wers, and receiv'd Replies, made a ha&s;ty jour|ney to <HI>Oxford</HI> from <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> to wait upon his Maje&s;ty. And it was then po&s;itively re&s;olv'd, <Q>&startq;that the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Oxford, Wallingford, Abingdon, Reading,</HI> and <HI>Banbury,</HI> &s;hould be reinforced, and &s;trengthen'd with all the Foot; that a good Body of Hor&s;e &s;hould remain about&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Oxford,</HI></Q> and the re&s;t &s;hould be &s;ent into the We&s;t to Prince <HI>Maurice.</HI> If this Coun&s;el had been pur&s;ued &s;teadily and re&s;olutely, it might pro|bably have been attended with good Succe&s;s: Both Armies of the Ene|my would have been puzled what to have done, and either of them would have been unwilling to have engaged in a Siege again&s;t any place &s;o well provided, and re&s;olved; and it would have been equally un|coun&s;ellable to have marched to any di&s;tance, and have left &s;uch an Enemy at their backs, that could &s;o ea&s;ily and quickly have united, and incommoded any March they could have made. <MILESTONE N="$0"></P>
<P>BUT as it was even impo&s;&s;ible to have admini&s;ter'd &s;uch advice to the King, in the &s;treight he was in, which being pur&s;ued might not have proved inconvenient; &s;o it was the unhappy temper of tho&s;e who were called to tho&s;e Councils, that re&s;olutions, taken upon full Debate, were &s;eldom pro&s;ecuted with equal re&s;olution and &s;teadine&s;s; but changed upon new, &s;horter Debates, and upon objections which had been an&s;wer'd before: Some Men being in their Natures irre&s;olute, and incon&s;tant, and full of objections, even after all was determined accord|ing to their own propo&s;als; others being po&s;itive, and not to be alter'd from what they had once declared, how unrea&s;onably &s;oever, or what alterations &s;oever there were in the Affairs. And the King him&s;elf fre|quently con&s;ider'd more the Per&s;on who &s;poke, as he was in his grace, or his prejudice, than the Coun&s;el it &s;elf that was given; and allways &s;u&s;pected, at lea&s;t tru&s;ted le&s;s to his own judgement than he ought to have done; which rarely deceiv'd him &s;o much as that of other Men.</P>
<P>THE Per&s;ons with whom he only con&s;ulted in his Martial Affairs, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Per&s;ons with whom the King con|&s;ulted in his Military Af|fairs at this time.</NOTE> and how to carry on the War, were (be&s;ides Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who was at this time ab&s;ent) the General, who was made Earl of <HI>Brentford;</HI> the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> who was General of the Hor&s;e; the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> who u&s;ually commanded an Army apart, and was not often with the King's Army, but now pre&s;ent; S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;tley,</HI> who was Major General of the Army; the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who was Secretary of State: and S^r <HI>Johu $olepepper</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Rolls; for none of the Privy Council, tho&s;e
<PB N="372" REF="4220">
two only excepted, were called to tho&s;e Con&s;ultations; though &s;ome of them were &s;till advi&s;ed with, for the better Execution, or Pro&s;ecu|tion, of what was then and there re&s;olv'd.</P>
<P>THE General, though he Had been, without doubt, a very good Officer, and had great Experience, and was &s;till a man of unque&s;tionable Courage and Integrity; yet he was now much decayed in his parts, and, with the long continued cu&s;tom of immoderate drinking, dozed in his Under&s;tanding, which had been never quick and vigorous; he having been allways illiterate to the greate&s;t degree that can be imagined. He was now become very deaf, yet often pretended not to have heard what he did not then contradict, and thought fit afterwards to di&s;claim. He <MILESTONE N="10"> was a Man of few Words, and of great Complyance, and u&s;ually deli|ver'd that as His opinion, which he fore&s;aw would be grateful to the King.</P>
<P>WILMOT was a Man of a haughty and ambitious Nature, of a plea|&s;ant Wit, and an ill Under&s;tanding, as never con&s;idering above one thing at once; but he con&s;ider'd that one thing &s;o impatiently, that he would not admit any thing el&s;e to be worth any Confideration. He had, from the beginning of the War, been very aver&s;e to any advice of the Privy Council, and thought fit that the King's Affairs (which depended upon the Succe&s;s of the War) &s;hould entirely be govern'd and conducted by <MILESTONE N="20"> the Soldiers, and Men of War; and that no other Coun&s;ellors &s;hould have any Credit with his Maje&s;ty. Whil&s;t Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was pre&s;ent, his exceeding great prejudice, or rather Per&s;onal Animo&s;ity again&s;t him, made any thing that <HI>Wilmot</HI> &s;aid or propo&s;ed, enough &s;lghted and con|tradicted: and the King him&s;elf, upon &s;ome former account and ob&s;er|vation, was far from any indulgence to his Per&s;on, or e&s;teem of his Parts. But now, by the Prince's ab&s;ence, and his being the &s;econd Man in the Army, and the Contempt he had of the old General, who was there the only Officer above him, he grew marvellou&s;ly elated, and <MILESTONE N="$0"> looked upon him&s;elf as one who&s;e advice ought to be followed, and &s;ubmitted to in all things. He had, by his exce&s;&s;ive good Fellow&s;hip (in every part whereof he excelled, and was grateful to all the Com|pany) made him&s;elf &s;o popular with all the Officers of the Army, e&s;pe|cially of the Hor&s;e, that he had, in truth, a very great Intere&s;t; which he de&s;ired might appear to the King, that he might have the more In|tere&s;t in Him. He was po&s;itive in all his Advices in Council, and bore Contradiction very impatiently; and becau&s;e he was mo&s;t Contradicted by the two Privy Coun&s;ellors, the Secretary, and the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, who, he &s;aw, had the greate&s;t Influence upon the King, he u&s;ed all the <MILESTONE N="$0"> Artifices he could to render them unacceptable and &s;u&s;pected to the Of|ficers of the Army, by telling them, what they had &s;aid in Council; which he thought would render them the more ungrateful; and, in the Times of Jollity, per&s;waded the old General to believe that they in|vaded his Prerogative, and meddled more in the Bu&s;ine&s;s of the War, than they ought to do; and thereby made him the le&s;s di&s;po&s;ed to con|cur with them in Advice, how rational and &s;ea&s;onable &s;oever it was; which often put the King to the trouble of converting him.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> was a Man Superior to any Temptation, and ab|horred enough the licence, and the levities, with which he &s;aw too many corrupted. He had a good Under&s;tanding, a clear Courage, an Indu&s;try not to be tired, and a Genero&s;ity that was not to be exhau&s;ted; a Virtue that none of the re&s;t had: but in the Debates concerning the

War, was longer in re&s;olving, and more apt to change his mind after he had re&s;olv'd, than is agreeable to the Office of a Commander in Chief; which render'd him rather fit for the Second, than for the Supreme Command in an Army.</P>
<P>S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;tley</HI> was an hone&s;t, brave, plain Man, and as fit for the Office he exerci&s;ed, of Major General of the Foot, as Chri&s;tendom yeild|ed; and was &s;o generally e&s;teem'd; very di&s;cerning and prompt in giving Orders, as the occa&s;ions required, and mo&s;t chearful, and pre&s;ent in any Action. In Council he u&s;ed few, but very pertinent words; and was not at all plea&s;ed with the long Speeches u&s;ually made there; and <MILESTONE N="10"> which rather confounded, than inform'd his Under&s;tanding: &s;o that he rather collected the ends of the Debates, and what he was him&s;elf to Do, than enlarged them by his own Di&s;cour&s;es; though he forbore not to deliver his own mind.</P>
<P>THE two Privy Coun&s;ellors, though they were of the mo&s;t different Natures and Con&s;titutions that can be imagined, allways agreed in their Opinions; and being, in their parts, much Superior to the other, u&s;ually prevailed upon the King's Judgement to like what they approved: yet one of them, who had in tho&s;e Ca&s;es the A&s;cendent over the other, had that Exce&s;s of Fancy, that he too often, upon his own recollecting and revolving the grounds of the Re&s;olutions which had been taken, or upon <MILESTONE N="20"> the Sugge&s;tions of other Men, changed his own mind; and thereupon cau&s;ed Orders to be alter'd, which produced, or were thought to pro|duce, many Inconveniences.</P>
<P>THIS un&s;teadine&s;s in Coun&s;els, and in matters re&s;olv'd upon, made the former Determination concerning the Garri&s;ons, to be little con&s;i|der'd. The King's Army had lain above three Weeks at, and about <HI>New|bury;</HI> in which time their Numbers were nothing improved, beyond what they had been upon their Mu&s;ter near <HI>Marlborough,</HI> when the King was pre&s;ent. When it was known that both the Parliament Ar|mies <MILESTONE N="$0"> were marched out of <HI>London;</HI> That under <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to <HI>Wind&s;or;</HI> and That of <HI>Waller,</HI> to the parts between <HI>Hert&s;ord-</HI>Bridge, and <HI>Ba&s;ing,</HI> with|out any purpo&s;e of going farther We&s;t; the King's Army marched to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Reading <HI>quitted by the King's Forces.</HI></NOTE> <HI>Reading;</HI> and in three days, his Maje&s;ty being pre&s;ent, they &s;lighted and demoli&s;hed all the works of that Garri&s;on: And then, which was about the middle of <HI>May,</HI> with the Addition of tho&s;e Soldiers, which encrea&s;ed the Army five and twenty hundred old Soldiers more, very well Officer'd, the Army retired to the Quarters about <HI>Oxford,</HI> with an opinion, that it would be in their power to Fight with one of the Enemies Armies; which they longed exceedingly to do. <MILESTONE N="$0"></P>
<P>THE King return'd to <HI>Oxford,</HI> and re&s;olv'd to &s;tay there till he could have better Information what the Enemy intended; which was not now &s;o ea&s;y as it had formerly been. For, &s;ince the Conjunction with the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners in one Council, for the carrying on the War, little bu&s;ine&s;s was brought to be Con&s;ulted in either of the Hou&s;es; and there was much greater Secrecy than before; few or none being admitted into any kind of Tru&s;t, but they who&s;e Affections were known to concur to the mo&s;t de&s;perate Coun&s;els. So that the De&s;igns were &s;till entirely form'd, before any part of them were communicated to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> nor was more communicated at a Time than was ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent Execution; of which he was &s;en&s;ible enough, but could not help it. The Intention was, <Q>&startq;that the two Armies, which marched out together, &s;hould afterward be di&s;tinct; and &s;hould only
<PB N="374" REF="4270">
keep together, till it appear'd what Cour&s;e the King meant to take; and if he &s;tayed in <HI>Oxford,</HI> it would be fit for both to be in the Siege; the Circumvallation being very great, and to be divided in many places by the River; which would keep both Armies &s;till a&s;under un|der&endq; their &s;everal Officers.</Q> But, if the King marched out, which they might rea&s;onably pre&s;ume he would, then the purpo&s;e was, <Q>&startq;that the&endq; Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;hould follow the King, wherever he went;</Q> which, they imagined, would be Northward; <Q>&startq;and that <HI>Waller</HI> &s;hould march into&endq; the We&s;t, and &s;ubdue That.</Q> So that, having &s;o &s;ub&s;tantially provided for the North, by the <HI>Scots,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter;</HI> and having an Army under the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> much Superior in Number to any the King could be attended with; and the third, under <HI>Waller,</HI> at Li|berty for the We&s;t; they promi&s;ed them&s;elves, and too rea&s;onably, that they &s;hould make an End of the War that Summer.</P>
<P>IT was about the Tenth of <HI>May,</HI> that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and S^r <HI>Wil|liam Waller</HI> marched out of <HI>London,</HI> with both their Armies; and the very next day after the King's Army had quitted <HI>Reading,</HI> the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> from <HI>Wind&s;or,</HI> &s;ent Forces to po&s;&s;e&s;s it; and recommended it to the City of <HI>London,</HI> to provide both Men, and all other things ne|ce&s;&s;ary for the keeping it; which the Memory of what they had &s;uffer'd for the two pa&s;t years, by being without it, ea&s;ily di&s;po&s;ed them to do. <MILESTONE N="$0"> By this means, the Earl had the Opportunity to joyn with <HI>Waller</HI>'s Ar|my when he &s;hould think fit; which before they could not do with Convenience, or Security. Nor did they ever after joyn in one Body, but kept at a fit Di&s;tance, to be able, if there were Occa&s;ion, to help each other.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army con&s;i&s;ted of all his old Troops, which had Winter'd about S^t <HI>Albans,</HI> and in <HI>Bedford-&s;hire;</HI> and being now encrea&s;ed with four Regiments of the Train'd-bands, and Auxiliaries within the City of <HI>London,</HI> did not amount to le&s;s than ten thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot. <HI>Waller</HI> had likewi&s;e receiv'd a large Recruit from <HI>London, Kent,</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex;</HI> and was little inferior in Numbers to <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and in Reputation above him. When the King's Army retired from <HI>Reading,</HI> the Hor&s;e Quarter'd about <HI>Wantage,</HI> and <HI>Farrington,</HI> and all the Foot were put into <HI>Abingdon,</HI> with a Re&s;olution to quit, or defend that Town, according to the manner of the Enemies Advance towards it; that is, if they came upon the Ea&s;t &s;ide, where, be&s;ides &s;ome indif|ferent Fortifications, they had the advantage of the River, they would maintain and defend it; if they came on the We&s;t &s;ide from <HI>Wantage,</HI> and <HI>Farrington,</HI> they would draw out and Fight, if the Enemy were not by much Superior in Number; and, in that Ca&s;e, they would retire with the whole Army to <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>BEING &s;atisfied with this Re&s;olution, they lay in that quiet Po&s;ture, without making the lea&s;t Impre&s;&s;ion upon the Enemy, by beating up his Quarters; which might ea&s;ily have been done; or re&s;training them from making Incur&s;ions where they had a mind; all which was imputed to the ill Humour, and Negligence of <HI>Wilmot.</HI> The Earl of <HI>E&s;sex</HI> ad|vanced with his Army towards <HI>Abingdon;</HI> and upon the Ea&s;t part of the Town; which was that which they had hoped for, in order to their Defending it. But they were no &s;ooner adverti&s;ed of it, but the Ge|neral, early the next Morning, marched with all the Foot out of <HI>Abingdon,</HI> the Hor&s;e being come thither in the Night to make good <NOTE PLACE="marg">Abingdon <HI>quitted by the King's Forces.</HI></NOTE> the Retreat: and all this was done before his Maje&s;ty had the lea&s;t
<PB N="375" REF="4280">
notice, or &s;u&s;picion of it. A&s;&s;oon as his Maje&s;ty was inform'd of it by S^r <HI>Charles Blunt,</HI> the Scout Ma&s;ter General, whom the General had &s;ent to acquaint the King with the Re&s;olution, he &s;ent S^r <HI>Charles Blunt</HI> back to the General, to let him know the great di&s;like he had of their purpo&s;e to quit the Town, and to command him to &s;tay, and not to advance till his Maje&s;ty came to him; which he made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t to do. But before the Me&s;&s;enger could return, the Army was within &s;ight of <HI>Oxford;</HI> and &s;o the Foot was drawn through the City, and the Hor&s;e Quarter'd in the Villages about the Town.</P>
<P>ABINGDON was in this manner, and to the King's infinite Trouble, quitted; whither a Party of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army came the &s;ame Night; and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Po&s;&s;e&s;s'd by the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"> the next day, him&s;elf with all his Foot enter'd the Town; his Hor&s;e being Quarter'd about it. He then called <HI>Waller</HI> to bring up his Army near him, that they might re&s;olve in what manner to proceed; and he had his head Quarter at <HI>Wantage:</HI> and &s;o, without the &s;triking one Blow, they got the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>Reading, Abingdon;</HI> and were Ma&s;ters of all <HI>Berk-&s;hire;</HI> and forced the King to draw his whole Army of Hor&s;e and Foot on the North &s;ide of <HI>Oxford;</HI> where they were to feed on his own Quarters, and to con&s;ider, how to keep <HI>Oxford</HI> it &s;elf from being Be|&s;ieged, and the King from being inclo&s;ed in it. <MILESTONE N="$0"></P>
<P>THIS was the deplorable Condition to which the King was reduced before the end of the Month of <HI>May;</HI> in&s;omuch that it was generally reported at <HI>London,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq; that <HI>Oxford</HI> was taken,</Q> and the King a Pri&s;oner; and others more Confidently gave it out, <Q>&startq;that his Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd to&endq; come to <HI>London:</HI></Q> of which the Parliament was not without &s;ome Ap|prehen&s;ion, though not &s;o much, as of the King's putting him&s;elf into the hands of the Earl of <HI>E&s;sex,</HI> and into his Protection; which They could not endure to think of; and this troubled them &s;o much, that the Committee of both Kingdoms, who Conducted the War, writ this <MILESTONE N="$0"> Letter to their General.</P>
<LETTER>

<P><Q>&startq;WE are credibly informed, that his Maje&s;ty intends to come for <HI>London.</HI> We de&s;ire you, that you will do your Endeavour to inform your &s;elf of the &s;ame; and if you think that his Maje&s;ty intends at all to come to the Armies, that you acquaint us with the &s;ame; and&endq; do nothing therein, until the Hou&s;es &s;hall give Direction.</Q></P>
</LETTER>
<P>So much Jealou&s;y they had of the Earl, and the more, becau&s;e they &s;aw not el&s;e what the King could do; who could not entertain any rea|&s;onable <MILESTONE N="$0"> Expectation of Encrea&s;e, or Addition of Force from the North, or from the We&s;t; Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> being then in his march into <HI>Lanca|&s;hire,</HI> for the Relief of the Earl of <HI>Derby</HI> (be&s;ieged in his Ca&s;tle of <HI>La|tham)</HI> and Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> being &s;till engaged in the unfortunate Siege of <HI>Lyme</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> a little Fi&s;her Town; which, after he had lain before it a Month, was much more like to hold out, than it was the fir&s;t day he came before it. In this Perplexity, the King &s;ent the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to provide better for the Security of that important City; where he knew <HI>Waller</HI> had many Friends; and him&s;elf re&s;olv'd yet to &s;tay at <HI>Oxford,</HI> till he &s;aw how the two Armies would di&s;po&s;e them&s;elves; that, when they were &s;o divided that they could not pre|&s;ently joyn, he might Fight with one of them; which was the greate&s;t hope he had now left.</P>
<P><PB N="376" REF="4290">
IT was very happy that the two Armies lay &s;o long quiet near each other, without pre&s;&s;ing the Advantages they had, or improving the Confu&s;ion, and Di&s;traction, which the King's Forces were, at that time, too much inclined to. Orders were given &s;o to Quarter the King's Ar|my, that it might keep the Rebels from pa&s;&s;ing over $$ther of the Ri|vers, <HI>Cherwel,</HI> or <HI>I&s;is,</HI> which run on the Ea&s;t and We&s;t &s;ides of the City; the Foot being, for the mo&s;t part, Quarter'd towards the <HI>Cherwel,</HI> and the Hor&s;e, with &s;ome Dragoons, near the <HI>I&s;is.</HI></P>
<P>IN this po&s;ture all the Armies lay quiet, and without Action, for the &s;pace of a day; which &s;omewhat compo&s;ed the minds of tho&s;e with|in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and of the Troops without; which had not yet recover'd their di&s;like of their having quitted <HI>Abingdon,</HI> and thereby of being &s;o &s;treighten'd in their Quarters. Some of <HI>Waller</HI>'s Forces attempted to pa&s;s the <HI>I&s;is</HI> at <HI>Newbridge,</HI> but were repul&s;ed by the King's Dragoons. But the next day <HI>E&s;sex,</HI> with his whole Army, got over the Thames at <HI>Sanford-</HI>Ferry, and marched to <HI>I&s;lip,</HI> where he made his Quarters; and, in his way, made a halt upon <HI>Bullington-</HI>Green, that the City might take a full view of his Army, and he of It. In order to which, him&s;elf, with a &s;mall Party of Hor&s;e, came within Cannon &s;hot; and little Par|ties of Hor&s;e came very near the Ports, and had light Skirmi&s;hes with &s;ome of the King's Hor&s;e, without any great hurt on either &s;ide.</P>
<P>THE next Morning, a &s;trong Party of the Earl's Army endeavour'd to pa&s;s over the <HI>Cherwel,</HI> at <HI>Go&s;worth-</HI>Bridge; but were repul&s;ed by the Mu&s;queteers with very con&s;iderable lo&s;s; and &s;o retired to their Body. And now the Earl, being engaged, with his whole Army, on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the River <HI>Cherwel,</HI> whereby he was di&s;abled to give, or receive any &s;peedy A&s;&s;i&s;tance to, or from <HI>Waller;</HI> the King re&s;olv'd to attempt the repo&s;&s;e&s;&s;ing him&s;elf of <HI>Abingdon,</HI> and to take the Oppor|tunity to Fight with <HI>Waller</HI> &s;ingly, before he could be reliev'd from the other Army. In order to this, all the Foot were in the Evening drawn off from the Guard of the Pa&s;&s;es, and marched through <HI>Oxford</HI> in the Night towards <HI>Abingdon;</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> a Man of &s;ignal Courage, and an excellent Officer upon any bold Enterpri&s;e, advanced, with a Party of one hundred and fifty Hor&s;e, to the Town it &s;elf; where there were a thou&s;and Foot, and four hundred Hor&s;e of <HI>Waller</HI>'s Ar|my; and enter'd the &s;ame, and killed many, and took &s;ome Pri&s;oners: but upon the Alarm, he was &s;o overpower'd, that his Pri&s;oners e&s;caped, though he killed the Chief Commander, and made his Retreat good, with the lo&s;s only of two Officers, and as many Common Soldiers; and &s;o, both the attempt upon <HI>Abingdon</HI> was given over, and the de&s;ign of Fighting <HI>Waller</HI> laid a&s;ide; and the Army return'd again to their old Po&s;t, on the North &s;ide of <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;tley</HI> undertook the Command him&s;elf at <HI>Go&s;worth-</HI>Bridge, where he perceiv'd the Earl intended to force his Pa&s;&s;age; and pre&s;ent|ly ca&s;t up Brea&s;t-works, and made a Redoubt for the Defence of his Men, and Repul&s;ed the Enemy, the &s;econd Time, very much to thei$ Damage and Lo&s;s; who renew'd their A&s;&s;ault two or three days toge|ther, and planted Cannon to facilitate their pa&s;&s;age; which did little hurt; but they &s;till lo&s;t many Men in the Attempt. On the other &s;ide&punc; <HI>Waller</HI>'s Forces from <HI>Abingdon</HI> did not find the new Bridge &s;o wel$ defended; but overpowering tho&s;e Guards, and having got Boats, i$ which they put over their Men, both above and below, they got that Pa&s;&s;age over the River <HI>I&s;is:</HI> by which they might have brought ove$

<P>IT was now high time for the King to provide for his own &s;ecurity, and to e&s;cape the danger he was in, of being &s;hut up in <HI>oxford.

<P>THE King re&s;olv'd, for the Encouragement of the Lords of the Coun|cil, and the Per&s;ons of Quality who were in <HI>Oxford,</HI> to leave his Son the Duke of <HI>York</HI> there; and promi&s;ed, if they &s;hould be Be&s;ieged, <Q>&startq;to do all he could to relieve them, before they &s;hould be reduced to Ex|tremity.&endq;</Q> He appointed then, <Q>&startq;that two thou&s;and and five hundred choice Mu&s;queteers &s;hould be drawn out of the whole Foot, under the Command of S^r <HI>Jacob Astley,</HI> and four experienced Colonels; all which &s;hould, without Colours, repair to the place where the Hor&s;e attended to receive Orders, and that the re&s;t of the Foot &s;hould re|main <MILESTONE N="$0"> together on the North &s;ide, and &s;o be applied to the Defence of&endq; <HI>Oxford,</HI></Q> if it &s;hould be Be&s;ieged.</P>
<P>ALL things being in this order, on <HI>Munday</HI> the third of <HI>June,</HI> about nine of the Clock at Night, the King, with the Prince, and tho&s;e Lords, and others who were appointed to attend him, and many others of Quality who were not appointed, and only thought them&s;elves le&s;s &s;e|cure if they &s;hould &s;tay behind, marched out of the North Port, at|tended by his own Troop, to the place where the Hor&s;e, and commanded Foot, waited to receive them; and from thence, without any halt, marched between the two Armies, and by Day-break were at <HI>Hanbo|rough,</HI> &s;ome miles beyond all their Quarters. But the King re&s;ted not till the Afternoon, when he found him&s;elf at <HI>Burford;</HI> and then con|cluded that he was in no danger to be overtaken by any Army that was to follow with Baggage, and a Train of Artillery: &s;o that he was con|tent to refre&s;h his Men there; and &s;upp'd him&s;elf; yet was not without Apprehen&s;ion that he might be follow'd by a Body of the Enemies Hor&s;e; and therefore, about nine of the Clock, he continued his March from <HI>Burford</HI> over the <HI>Cot&s;wold,</HI> and by Mid-night reached <HI>Burton</HI> upon the Water; where he gave him&s;elf, and his wearied Troops, more re&s;t and refre&s;hment.</P>
<P>THE Morning after the King left <HI>Oxford,</HI> the Foot marched again through <HI>Oxford,</HI> as if they meant to go to <HI>Abingdon,</HI> to continue that
<PB N="378" REF="4310">
Amu&s;ement which the day before had prevailed with <HI>Waller,</HI> to &s;end many of his Men back, and to delay his own Advance; and likewi&s;e, that Quarters might be provided for them again&s;t their return; which they did by Noon. The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had that Morning, from <HI>Blech|ingdon,</HI> &s;ent &s;ome Hor&s;e to take a view of <HI>Oxford;</HI> and to learn what was doing there. And they &s;eeing the Colours &s;tanding, as they had done two days before, made him conclude, that the King was &s;till there, and as much in his power as ever. <HI>Waller</HI> had earlier Intelligence of his Maje&s;ties motion, and &s;ent a good Body of Hor&s;e to follow him, and to retard his March, till he could come up: and his Hor&s;e made &s;uch ha&s;t, that they found in <HI>Burford</HI> &s;ome of the &s;traggling Soldiers, who <MILESTONE N="10"> out of wearine&s;s, or for love of Drink, had &s;tayed behind their Fellows. The Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> follow'd likewi&s;e with his Army, and Quarter'd at <HI>Chippen-Norton;</HI> and <HI>Waller</HI>'s Hor&s;e were as far as <HI>Broadway,</HI> when the King had reached <HI>Eve&s;ham;</HI> where he intended to re&s;t, as in a &s;e|cure place; though his Garri&s;on at <HI>Tewkesbury</HI> had been, the Night before, &s;urpri&s;ed by a &s;trong Party from <HI>Glouce&s;ter;</HI> the Chief Officers being kill'd, and the re&s;t taken Pri&s;oners; mo&s;t of the Common Sol|diers making their E&s;cape, and coming to <HI>Eve&s;ham.</HI> But, upon Intel|ligence that both Armies follow'd by &s;trong marches, and it being po&s;|&s;ible that they might get over the River <HI>Avon</HI> about <HI>Stratford,</HI> or &s;ome <MILESTONE N="20"> other place, and &s;o get between the King and <HI>Worcester,</HI> his Maje&s;ty changed his purpo&s;e of &s;taying at <HI>Eve&s;ham,</HI> and pre&s;ently march'd to <HI>Worcester;</HI> having given order for the breaking of the Bridge at <HI>Par|&s;hore;</HI> which was, unwarily, &s;o near done before all the Troops were pa&s;s'd, that, by the &s;uddain falling of an Arch, Major <HI>Bridges,</HI> of the Prince's Regiment, a Man of good Courage and Conduct, with two or three other Officers of Hor&s;e, and about twenty common Men, fell unfortunately into the <HI>Avon,</HI> and were drown'd.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>E&s;sex,</HI> when he &s;aw the King was got full two days <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>marches towards the We&s;t;</HI></NOTE> March before him, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible &s;o to overtake him, as to bring him into their Power, re&s;olv'd to pur&s;ue him no farther, but to con&s;ult what was el&s;e to be done; and, to that purpo&s;e, called a Council of all the principal Officers of both Armies, to attend him at <HI>Burford;</HI> where it was re&s;olv'd, <Q>&startq;that <HI>Waller,</HI> who had the lighter Ordnance, and the le&s;s Carriages, &s;hould have &s;uch an Addition of Forces, as <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> &s;hould be able to furni&s;h him with; and &s;o &s;hould pur&s;ue and follow the King, where|&s;oever he &s;hould go; and that the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who had the greater Ordnance, and the heavier Carriages, &s;hould pro&s;ecute the other De|&s;ign of relieving <HI>Lyme,</HI> and reducing the We&s;t to the Obedience of&endq; the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>WALLER oppo&s;ed this Re&s;olution all he could; and urged &s;ome Or|der, and Determination of the Committee of both Kingdoms in the point; and, <Q>&startq;that the We&s;t was a&s;&s;ign'd to Him, as His Province, when&endq; the two Armies &s;hould think fit to &s;ever from each other.</Q> However, <HI>E&s;sex</HI> gave him po&s;itive Orders, as his General, <Q>&startq;to march according&endq; to the advice of the Council of War;</Q> which he dur&s;t not di&s;obey, but &s;ent grievous Complaints to the Parliament, of the u&s;age he was forced to &s;ubmit to. And they at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> were &s;o incen&s;ed again&s;t the$ Earl of <HI>E&s;sex,</HI> that they writ a very angry, and imperious Letter to him, in which they reproached him, <Q>&startq;for not &s;ubmitting to the Di|rections&endq; which They had given;</Q> <Q>and required him &startq;to follow their
<PB N="379" REF="4320">
former Directions, and to &s;uffer <HI>Waller</HI> to attend the Service of the&endq; We&s;t.</Q> Which Letter was brought to him before he had marched above two days We&s;tward. But the Earl cho&s;e rather to An&s;wer their Letter, than to Obey their Order; and writ to them, <Q>&startq;that their Directions had been contrary to the Di&s;cipline of War, and to Rea&s;on; and that, if he &s;hould now return, it would be a great Encouragement to the&endq; Enemy in all places;</Q> and Sub&s;cribed his Letter, <Q>&startq;Your innocent,&endq; though &s;u&s;pected Servant,</Q> <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and then pro&s;ecuted his Re&s;olution, and continued his March for the We&s;t.</P>
<P>WHEN <HI>Waller</HI> found there was no remedy, he obeyed his Orders <NOTE PLACE="marg">Waller <HI>to|wards</HI> Wor|ce&s;ter, <HI>after the King.</HI></NOTE> with much Diligence and Vigour; and pro&s;ecuted his March towards <MILESTONE N="$0"> <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> where his Maje&s;ty then was; and, in his way, per&s;waded, rather than forced, the Garri&s;on of <HI>Sudely</HI> Ca&s;tle, the &s;trong Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Chandois,</HI> to deliver up that place to him. The Lord of that Ca&s;tle was a young Man of Spirit and Courage; and had, for two Years, &s;erv'd the King very bravely in the head of a Regiment of Hor&s;e, which him&s;elf had rai&s;ed at his own Charge; but had lately, out of $ure weari|ne&s;s of the Fatigue, and having &s;pent mo&s;t of his Money, and without any Diminution of his Affection, left the King, under pretence of Tra|vel; but making <HI>London</HI> his way, he gave him&s;elf up to the plea&s;ures <MILESTONE N="$0"> of that place; which he enjoy'd, without Con&s;idering the I&s;&s;ue of the War, or &s;hewing any Inclination to the Parliament; nor did he, in any degree, contribute to the delivery of his Hou&s;e; which was at fir&s;t imagined, becau&s;e it was &s;o ill, or not at all, defended. It was under the Government of S^r <HI>William Morton,</HI> a Gentleman of the long Robe; who, in the beginning of the War, ca&s;t off his Gown, as many other gallant Men of that Profe&s;&s;ion of the Law did, and &s;erv'd as Lieutenant Colonel in the Regiment of Hor&s;e under the Lord <HI>Chandois;</HI> and had given &s;o frequent Te&s;timony of &s;ignal Courage in &s;everal Actions, in which he had receiv'd many wounds, both by the Pi&s;tol and the Sword, that his Mettle was never &s;u&s;pected; and his Fidelity as little que&s;tion'd: and after many Years of Impri&s;onment, &s;u&s;tain'd with great Firmne&s;s and Con&s;tancy, he lived to receive the Reward of his Merit, after the Return of the King; who made him fir&s;t a Serjeant at Law, and after|wards a Judge of the King's Bench; where he &s;ate many years, and di&s;|charged the Office with much Gravity and Learning; and was very terrible to tho&s;e who cho&s;e to live by Robbing on the High-way. He was unfortunate, though without Fault, in the giving up that Ca&s;tle in &s;o un&s;ea&s;onable a Conjuncture; which was done by the Faction and Ar|tifice of an Officer within, who had found means to go out to <HI>Waller,</HI> and to acquaint him with the great wants of the Garri&s;on; which in|deed had not plenty of any thing: and &s;o, by the Mutiny of the Sol|diers, it was given up; and the Governour made Pri&s;oner, and &s;ent to the Tower; where he remained &s;ome Years after the end of the War. From hence <HI>Waller,</HI> with great Expedition, marched to <HI>Eve&s;ham;</HI> where the evil Inhabitants receiv'd him willingly; and had, a&s;&s;oon as the King left them, repaired their Bridge over the <HI>Avon,</HI> to facilitate his coming to them; which he could not el&s;e &s;o &s;oon have done.</P>
<P>THE King re&s;ted &s;ome days at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> whereby he very much refre&s;hed his Troops, which were there &s;pared from doing duty; and likewi&s;e, by the Loyalty of that good Town, and the Affection of the Gentry of that County, who retired thither for their Security, he pro|cured both Shoes and Stockings, and Money for his Souldiers: and
<PB N="380" REF="4330">
then, upon good Information, that <HI>Waller</HI> was marched out of <HI>Eve&s;ham</HI> with his whole Army towards <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> which he would probably Be&s;iege, the King re&s;olv'd not to be found there; and therefore, having left that City well provided, and in good heart, his Maje&s;ty removed with his little Army to <HI>Bewdley,</HI> that he might keep the River <HI>Severn</HI> between Him and the Enemy; the Foot being Quarter'd together at <HI>Bewdley,</HI> and the Hor&s;e by the &s;ide of the River towards <HI>Bridgenorth.</HI> The po&s;ture in which the King was, made <HI>Waller</HI> conclude that his Ma|je&s;ty intended his Cour&s;e to <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> and to the more Northern Parts. And it is true, that, without any &s;uch Re&s;olution, Orders were &s;ent to <HI>Shrewsbury, Bridgenorth, Ludlow,</HI> and other Garri&s;ons, <Q>&startq;that <MILESTONE N="10"> they &s;hould make all po&s;&s;ible Provi&s;ions of Corn, and other Victual;&endq; which they &s;hould cau&s;e,</Q> in great Quantities, to be brought thither; which confirm'd <HI>Waller</HI> in his former Conjecture, and made him ad|vance with his Army beyond the King, that he might be nearer <HI>Shrews|bury</HI> than He. But, God knows, the King was without any other De|&s;ign, than to avoid the Enemy; with whom he could not, with &s;uch a handful of Foot, and without Cannon, propo&s;e rea&s;onably to fight a Battle: and he had too many good Rea&s;ons again&s;t going to either of tho&s;e places, or to tho&s;e parts, which <HI>Waller</HI> conceiv'd him inclined to; and his Maje&s;ty might well a&s;&s;ume the Complaint, and Expre&s;&s;ion of <MILESTONE N="20"> King <HI>David,</HI> <Q>&startq;&endq; that he <HI>was hunted as a Partridge upon the Mountains;</HI> and knew not whither to re&s;ort, or to what place to repair for re&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>IN this Perplexity, it looked like the Bounty of Providence, that <HI>Waller</HI> was advanced &s;o far: upon which, the King took a &s;uddain Re|&s;olution, to return with all Expedition to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and to make ha&s;t to <HI>Eve&s;ham;</HI> where, having broke the Bridge, and &s;o left the River of <HI>Avon</HI> at his back, he might be able, by quick Marches, to joyn with that part of his Army, which he had left at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and might thereby be in a Condition to Fight with <HI>Waller,</HI> and to pro&s;ecute any other De&s;ign. Upon this good Re&s;olution, care was taken for all the Boats to come both from <HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI> that the Foot might, with the more &s;peed and ea&s;e, be carried thither; all which &s;ucceeded to wi&s;h. In&s;omuch, that the next day, being embarqued early in the Morning, the Foot arriv'd &s;o &s;oon at <HI>Worcester,</HI> that they might very well have marched that Night to <HI>Eve&s;ham,</HI> but that many of the Hor&s;e, which were Quarter'd beyond <HI>Bewdely</HI> towards <HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> could not po&s;&s;i|bly march at that rate, nor come up &s;oon enough; &s;o that it was ne|ce&s;&s;ary that both Hor&s;e and Foot &s;hould remain that Night together at <HI>Worcester;</HI> which they did accordingly.</P>
<P>THE next Morning, the King found no cau&s;e to alter any thing in his former Re&s;olution; and receiv'd good Intelligence, that <HI>Waller,</HI> without knowing any thing of his Motion, remained &s;till in his old Quar|ters; whereupon he marched very fa&s;t to <HI>Eve&s;ham;</HI> nor would he &s;tay there; but gave order for the Hor&s;e and Foot, without delay, to march through it; after he had provided for the breaking down the Bridge, and made the Inhabitants of the Town pay two hundred Pounds, for their alacrity in the reception of <HI>Waller;</HI> and likewi&s;e compelled them to deliver a thou&s;and pair of Shoes for the u&s;e of the Soldiers; which&punc; without any long pau&s;e, was &s;ubmitted to, and perform'd. Then th$ Army marched that Night to <HI>Broadway,</HI> where they Quarter'd; and very early the next Morning, they mounted the Hills near <HI>Camden$</HI> and there they had time to breath, and to look with plea&s;ure on th$
<PB N="381" REF="4340">
places they had pa&s;&s;ed through; having now left <HI>Waller,</HI> and the ill ways he mu&s;t pa&s;s, far enough behind; for even in that Sea&s;on of the Year, the ways in that Vale were very deep.</P>
<P>NOW the King &s;ent Colonel <HI>Fielding,</HI> and le&s;t he might mi&s;carry (for both from <HI>Gloucester, Tewkesbury,</HI> and <HI>Sudely-</HI>Ca&s;tle, the Enemy had many Scouts abroad) two or three other Me&s;&s;engers, to the Lords of the Council at <HI>Oxford,</HI> <Q>to let them know &startq;of his happy Return; and that he meant to Quarter that Night at <HI>Burford;</HI> and the next, at <HI>Whitney;</HI> where he did expect, that all his Foot, with their Colours&endq; and Cannon,</Q> would meet him; which, with un&s;peakable Joy, they did. So that, on <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the twentieth of <HI>June,</HI> which was within &s;eventeen days after he had left <HI>Oxford</HI> in that di&s;con&s;olate Condition, the King found him&s;elf in the head of his Army, from which he had been &s;o &s;evered, after &s;o many Accidents and melancholick Perplexities, to which Maje&s;ty has been &s;eldom expo&s;ed. Nor can all the Circum|&s;tances of that peregrination be too particularly, and punctually &s;et down. For as they admini&s;ter'd much delight after they were pa&s;&s;ed, a$d gave them great Argument of acknowledging God's good Providenc$ in the pre&s;ervation of the King, and, in a manner, &s;natching him as a Brand out <MILESTONE N="$0"> of the Fire, and redeeming him even out of the hands of the Rebels; &s;o it cannot be ungrateful, or without &s;ome plea&s;ure to po&s;terity, to &s;ee the mo&s;t exact Relation of an Action &s;o full of danger in all re&s;pects, and of an E&s;cape &s;o remarkable. And now the King thought him&s;elf in a po&s;ture not only to abide <HI>Waller,</HI> if he approached towards him, but to follow and find him out, if he had a mind, or did endeavour to decline fighting with his Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>IN the &s;hort time the King had been ab&s;ent, the Garri&s;on at <HI>Oxford</HI> was not idle. When the King in the Spring had prepared for the Field, and in order thereunto had drawn out the Garri&s;on at <HI>Reading,</HI> it was <MILESTONE N="$0"> thought to no purpo&s;e to keep le&s;&s;er Garri&s;ons, at a le&s;s di&s;tance from <HI>Oxford;</HI> and thereupon the Garri&s;on at <HI>Bo&s;tal-</HI>Hou&s;e, reputed a &s;trong place, upon the Edge of <HI>Oxford-&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Buckingham-&s;hire,</HI> was ap|pointed to demoli&s;h the Works and Fortifications, and to retire, and joyn with the Army: which was no &s;ooner done, but the Garri&s;on at <HI>Aylesbury,</HI> that had felt the Effects of the others ill Neighbourhood, po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the place, and put a Garri&s;on into it; which, after the King had left <HI>Oxford,</HI> and both the Armies of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Waller,</HI> were gone from before it, gave little le&s;s Trouble to that City, and ob&s;tructed the Pro|vi&s;ions which &s;hould come thither, allmo&s;t as much as one of the Ar|mies <MILESTONE N="$0"> had done. This brought great complaints and clamour from the Country, and from the Town, to the Lords of the Council; and was ever made an Excu&s;e for their not complying with the Commands they &s;ent out, for Labourers to work upon the Fortifications; which was the principal work in hand; or for any other &s;ervice of the Town. When both Armies were drawn off to &s;uch a di&s;tance in following the King, that there &s;eem'd for the pre&s;ent no rea&s;onable apprehen&s;ion of being be&s;ieged, the Lords con&s;ider'd of a Remedy to apply to this evil from <HI>Bo&s;tal-</HI>Hou&s;e; and receiving encouragement from Colonel <HI>Gage</HI> (of whom they had a great e&s;teem, and of whom we &s;hall &s;peak &s;hortly <MILESTONE N="$0"> more at large) who offer'd to undertake the reducing it, they appointed a Party of commanded Men of the Foot, which the King had left there, with three pieces of Cannon, and a Troop of Hor&s;e of the Town, to obey His Orders, who, by the break of day, appear'd before the place; and
<PB N="382" REF="4350">
in a &s;hort time, with little re&s;i&s;tance, got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Church, and the Out-Hou&s;es, and then batter'd the Hou&s;e it &s;elf with his Cannon; which they within, would not long endure; but de&s;ired a Parley. Upon which the Hou&s;e was render'd, with the Ammunition, one piece of Ordnance, which was all they had; and much good provi&s;ion of Victual, whereof they had plenty for Hor&s;e and Man; and had Liberty given them to go away with their Armes, and Hor&s;es; very ea&s;y Conditions for &s;o &s;trong a Po&s;t; which was obtain'd with the lo&s;s of one Inferior Officer, and two or three Common Men. Here the Colonel left a Gar|ri&s;on, that did not only defend <HI>Oxford</HI> from tho&s;e mi&s;chievous Incur|&s;ions, but did very near &s;upport it &s;elf, by the Contribution it drew <MILESTONE N="10"> from <HI>Buckingham-&s;hire,</HI> be&s;ides the Prey it frequently took from the very neighbourhood of <HI>Aylesbury.</HI></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> by &s;low and ea&s;y Marches, and without any Op|po&s;ition or Trouble, enter'd into <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire;</HI> and by his great Civility, and Affability towards all Men, and the very good Di&s;cipline in his Ar|my, wrought very much upon the People. In&s;omuch that his Forces rather encrea&s;ed, than dimini&s;hed; which had, during his being before <HI>Oxford,</HI> been much le&s;&s;en'd, not only by the Numbers which were kill'd and hurt, but by the running away of many, whil&s;t the &s;harp Encounters continued at <HI>Go&s;worth-</HI>Bridge. It can hardly be imagin'd, how great a <MILESTONE N="20"> Difference there was in the humour, di&s;po&s;ition, and manner of the Ar|my under <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and the other under <HI>Waller,</HI> in their behaviour and hu|manity towards the People; and, con&s;equently, in the Reception they found among them; the demeanour, and carriage of tho&s;e under <HI>Waller</HI> being much more ungentlemanly, and barbarous, than that of the other: be&s;ides that the People, in all places, were not without &s;ome Affection, and even Reverence towards the Earl, who, as well upon his own ac|count, as the memory of his Father, had been allways univer&s;ally po|pular.</P>
<P>WHEN he came to <HI>Blandford,</HI> he had a great mind to make him&s;elf <MILESTONE N="30"> Ma&s;ter of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> if he could compa&s;s it without engaging his Ar|my before it; which he re&s;olv'd Not to do; however it was little out of his way to pa&s;s near it. Colonel <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> then Governour of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> was made choice of for that Command, upon the Opinion of his Courage, and Dexterity; and, to make way for him, S^r <HI>Anthony A&s;hley Cooper</HI> had been, the Year before, removed from that Charge; and was thereby &s;o much di&s;obliged, that he quitted the King's Party, and gave him&s;elf up, Body and Soul, to the Service of the Parliament, with an implacable Animo&s;ity again&s;t the Royal Intere&s;t. The Colonel <MILESTONE N="40"> had been intent upon other things, and not enough &s;ollicitous to fini&s;h the Fortifications, which were not &s;trong enough to defy an Army, yet too &s;trong to be deliver'd upon the Approach of one. I &s;hall &s;ay the le&s;s of this matter, becau&s;e the Governour afterwards pre&s;&s;ed to have the whole examin'd before a Council of War, where he produced a War|rant, under the hand of Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> <Q>&startq;that, the Town being un|tenable, he &s;hould, upon the advance of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> put a &s;uf|ficient&endq; &s;trength into <HI>Portland-</HI>Ca&s;tle,</Q> and retire thither; which he had done; and was, by the Council of War, ab&s;olv'd from any Crime. Yet, the truth is, however ab&s;olv'd, he lo&s;t Reputation by it; and was thought <MILESTONE N="50"> to have left the Town too &s;oon, though he meant to have return'd again, after he had vi&s;ited <HI>Portland.</HI> But in the mean time the Town&s;men <NOTE PLACE="marg">Weymouth <HI>deliver'd to the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex.</NOTE> mutiny'd, and &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> when he was near the Town;
<PB N="383" REF="4360">
whereupon he came thither; which he would not otherwi&s;e have done; and gave the Garri&s;on leave to march with their Armes to Prince <HI>Mau|rice;</HI> and &s;o became Ma&s;ter of <HI>Weymouth;</HI> and leaving Men enough out of the Country to defend it, without any delay, he pro&s;ecuted his march to <HI>Lyme;</HI> from whence Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> upon the news of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Lyme <HI>reliev'd by him.</HI></NOTE> lo&s;s of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> had retired with ha&s;t enough towards <HI>Exeter,</HI> with a Body of full five and twenty hundred Foot, and eighteen hundred Hor&s;e; after he had put a Garri&s;on of five hundred Men into <HI>Wareham,</HI> and with &s;ome lo&s;s of Reputation, for having lain &s;o long with &s;uch a &s;trength before &s;o vile and untenable a place, without reducing it. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>ASSOON as the King had joyn'd his Army at <HI>Whitney,</HI> which now con&s;i&s;ted of full five thou&s;and five hundred Foot, and very near four thou&s;and Hor&s;e, with a convenient Train of Artillery, he re&s;olv'd no longer to live upon his own Quarters, which had been too much wa&s;ted by Friends and Enemies; but to vi&s;it the Enemies Country; and &s;o, the next day, he marched towards <HI>Buckingham;</HI> where he would &s;tay, and expect <HI>Waller</HI> (of who&s;e motion he yet heard nothing) and from whence, if he appear'd not, his Maje&s;ty might enter into the A&s;&s;ociated Counties, and &s;o proceed Northward, if, upon Intellig$nce from thence, he found it rea&s;onable. Whil&s;t the King &s;taid at <HI>Bucking$am,</HI> and thought <MILESTONE N="$0"> him&s;elf now in a good Condition to fight with the Enemy (his Troops, every day bringing in &s;tore of Provi&s;ions, and, being now in a Country where they were not expected, met with many Cart-loads of Wine, Grocery, and Tobacco, which were pa&s;&s;ing, as in &s;ecure roads, from <HI>London</HI> to <HI>Coventry,</HI> and <HI>Warwick;</HI> all which were very welcome to <HI>Buckingham)</HI> a new, and unexpected Trouble fell upon him by the ill humour, and Faction in his own Army. <HI>Wilmot</HI> continued &s;till &s;ullen and perver&s;e, and every day grew more in&s;olent; and had contracted &s;uch an Animo&s;ity again&s;t the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, that he per&s;waded many Officers of the Army, e&s;pecially of the Hor&s;e, <MILESTONE N="30"> where he was mo&s;t entirely obeyed, <Q>to joyn in a Petition to the King, &startq;that tho&s;e two Coun&s;ellors might be excluded, and be no more pre&s;ent&endq; in Councils of War; which they promi&s;ed to do.</Q></P>
<P>WALLER remain'd &s;till in <HI>Worcester-&s;hire;</HI> upon which it was again Con&s;ulted, what the King was to do. <Q>Some propo&s;ed &startq;the marching&endq; pre&s;ently into the A&s;&s;ociated Counties;</Q> <Q>others, &startq;to lo&s;e no time in en|deavouring&endq; to joyn with Prince <HI>Rupert.</HI></Q> <HI>Wilmot,</HI> without ever com|municating it with the King, po&s;itively advi&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that they might pre|&s;ently march towards <HI>London,</HI> and now both their Generals, and Ar|mies were far from them, make tryal what the true affection of the <MILESTONE N="40"> City was; and that, when the Army was marched as far as S^t <HI>Albans,</HI> the King &s;hould &s;end &s;uch a gracious Me&s;&s;age both to the Parliament,&endq; and City,</Q> as was mo&s;t like to prevail upon them; <Q>and concluded, as if he knew &startq;that this way of Proceeding would be very much approv'd&endq; of by the Army.</Q> This extravagant motion, with all the Circum&s;tances of it, troubled the King very much; yet he thought not fit ab&s;olutely to reject it, le&s;t it might promote that Petition, which he knew was $raming among the Officers; but wi&s;hed them, <Q>&startq;that &s;uch a Me&s;&s;age &s;hould be prepared, and then that he would Communicate both that, and what concern'd his march towards <HI>London,</HI> to the Lords of the <MILESTONE N="$0"> Council at <HI>Oxford;</HI> that in &s;o weighty an Arrair he might receive Their&endq; Coun&s;el.</Q> To that purpo&s;e the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and the Ma&s;ter of the Rolls, were &s;ent to <HI>Oxford;</HI> who, after two days, return'd without any Ap|probation
<PB N="384" REF="4370">
of the march, or the Me&s;&s;age by the Lords. But all that In|trigue fell of it &s;elf, upon the &s;ure Intelligence, <Q>&startq;that <HI>Waller</HI> had left <HI>Worcester-&s;hire,</HI> and marched, with what &s;peed he could, to find his&endq; Maje&s;ty;</Q> which gave new Argument of Debate.</P>
<P>WHEN the King had &s;o dextrou&s;ly deceiv'd, and eluded him by his quick march to and from <HI>Worcester, Waller,</HI> who had not timely Infor|mation of it, and le&s;s &s;u&s;pected it, thought it not to the purpo&s;e to tire his Army with long marches in hope to overtake him; but fir&s;t &s;hew'd it at all the Walls of <HI>Worcester,</HI> to terrify that City, which had con|temn'd his power a year before, when it was not &s;o well able to re&s;i&s;t it. But he quickly di&s;cern'd he could do no good there: then he marched <MILESTONE N="10"> towards <HI>Gloucester,</HI> having &s;ent to Colonel <HI>Ma&s;&s;ey</HI> to &s;end him &s;ome Men out of <HI>Gloucester;</HI> which he, being a Creature of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s, refu&s;ed to do. Upon this Denial, he marched into <HI>Warwick-&s;hire;</HI> and appointed his Rendezvous in <HI>Keinton</HI> Field, the place where the fir&s;t Battle was fought. There he receiv'd an addition of &s;even Troops of Hor&s;e, and about &s;ix hundred Foot, from <HI>Warwick</HI> and from <HI>Coventry,</HI> with eleven pieces of Ordnance. With this Recruit he marched confidently towards the King; of which his Maje&s;ty being inform'd, that he might the &s;ooner meet him, he marched with his Army to <HI>Brackley,</HI> when <HI>Waller</HI> was near <HI>Banbury;</HI> and the Armies coming &s;hortly in view of each other, <MILESTONE N="20"> upon a fair Sun-&s;hine in the Afternoon, after a very wet Morning, both endeavour'd to po&s;&s;e&s;s a piece of Ground they well knew to be of Ad|vantage; which being nearer to <HI>Waller,</HI> and the King pa&s;&s;ing his whole Army through the Town of <HI>Banbury,</HI> before he could come to it, <HI>Waller</HI> had fir&s;t his Men upon it in good Order of Battle, before the King could reach thither: &s;o that the King lay that Night in the Field, half a mile Ea&s;t of <HI>Banbury,</HI> the River of <HI>Cherwel</HI> being between the two Armies.</P>
<P>THE King re&s;olv'd to make <HI>Waller</HI> draw off from that Advantage <MILESTONE N="$0"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The fight at</HI> Cropredy<HI>-Bridge.</HI></NOTE> ground, where he had &s;tood two days; and in order thereunto, marched away, as if he would enter further into <HI>Northampton-&s;hire&punc;</HI> and he no &s;ooner moved, but <HI>Waller</HI> likewi&s;e drew off from his ground, and coa&s;ted on the other &s;ide of the River, but at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that it was thought he had no mind to be engaged. The Van of the King's Army was led by the General, and <HI>Wilmot:</HI> in the Body was the King, and the Prince, and the Rear con&s;i&s;ted of one thou&s;and commanded Foot, under Co|lonel <HI>Thelwell,</HI> with the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI>'s and the Earl of <HI>Cleve|land</HI>'s Brigades of Hor&s;e. And, that the Enemy might not be able to take any advantage, a Party of Dragoons was &s;ent to keep <HI>Cropredy-</HI>Bridge, until the Army was pa&s;&s;ed beyond it. The Army marching in this order, Intelligence was brought to the King, <Q>&startq;that there was a Body of three hundred Hor&s;e, within le&s;s than two miles of the Van of the Army, that marched to joyn with <HI>Waller;</HI> and that they might&endq; be ea&s;ily cut off,</Q> if the Army mended their pace. Whereupon, Or|ders were &s;ent to the foremo&s;t Hor&s;e, <Q>&startq;&endq; that they &s;hould move fa&s;ter,</Q> the Van and the middle having the &s;ame Directions, without any notice given to the Rear. <HI>Waller</HI> quickly di&s;cern'd the great di&s;tance that was &s;uddainly grown between the King's Body and his Rear, and pre&s;ently advanced with fifteen hundred Hor&s;e, one thou&s;and Foot, and eleven pieces of Cannon to <HI>Cropredy-</HI>Bridge, which were quickly too &s;trong for the Dragoons that were left to keep it, and which made a very fain$ Re&s;i&s;tance: &s;o that this Party advanced above half a mile, pur&s;uing
<PB N="385" REF="4380">
their De&s;ign of cutting off the King's Rear, before they &s;hould be able to get up to the Body of the Army. To facilitate this Execution, he had &s;ent one thou&s;and Hor&s;e more, to pa&s;s over at a Ford a mile below <HI>Cropredy-</HI>Bridge, and to fall upon the Rear of all. Timely notice being given of this to the Earl of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> who was in the Van of that Di|vi&s;ion, <Q>and &startq;&endq;</Q>of the Enemies having pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Cropredy</HI> (which was con|firm'd by the running of the Hor&s;e, <Q>and &s;catter'd Foot) &startq;and that there&endq; &s;tood two Bodies of Hor&s;e without moving,</Q> and faced the Army: Thereupon the Earl pre&s;ently drew up his Brigade to a ri&s;ing ground that faced that pa&s;s, where he di&s;cern'd a great Body of the Rebels Hor&s;e drawn up, and ready to have fallen upon his Rear. It was no time to <MILESTONE N="10"> expect Orders; but the Earl, led by his own great Spirit, Charged pre|&s;ently that body with great fury, which &s;u&s;tain'd it not with equal Cou|rage; lo&s;ing a Cornet, and many Pri&s;oners.</P>
<P>THIS Alarm had quickly reached the King, who &s;ent to the Van to return, and him&s;elf drew up tho&s;e about him, to a little Hill beyond the Bridge; where he &s;aw the Enemy preparing for a &s;econd Charge upon the Earl of <HI>Cleveland.</HI> The King commanded the $ord <HI>Bernard Stuart,</HI> a valiant young Gentleman, who commanded his own Guards, <Q>&startq;to make ha&s;t to the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Rear; and, in his way, to Charge&endq; tho&s;e two Bodies of Hor&s;e which faced his Maje&s;ty.</Q> He, with above <MILESTONE N="20"> a hundred of gallant and &s;tout Gentlemen, return'd in&s;tantly over the Bridge, and made ha&s;t towards tho&s;e two Bodies of Hor&s;e; who, &s;eeing their fellows Routed by the Earl of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> were then advancing to Charge him in the Flank, as he was following the Execution. But the pre&s;ence of this Troop made them change their mind; and, after a very little &s;tay, accompany their fellows in their Flight; which very much facilitated the Defeat, that quickly en&s;ued.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Cleveland,</HI> after his &s;hort encounter, made a &s;tand un|der a great A&s;h (where the King had but half an hour before &s;tay'd and dined) not under&s;tanding what the Enemy could mean by advancing <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;o fa&s;t, and then flying &s;o &s;oon; when he perceiv'd a Body of their Hor&s;e of &s;ixteen Cornets, and as many Colours of Foot, placed within the Hedges, and all within Mu&s;quet &s;hot of him, and advancing upon him; which He likewi&s;e did upon Them with notable vigour; and having &s;tood their Mu&s;quet and Carabine &s;hot, he Charged them &s;o fu|riou&s;ly, being re&s;olutely &s;econded by all the Officers of his Brigade, that he Routed both Hor&s;e and Foot, and cha&s;ed them with good Execution beyond their Cannon: all which, being eleven pieces, were taken; with two Barricadoes of Wood, which were drawn upon Wheels, and in each &s;even &s;mall Bra&s;s and Leather Guns, charged with Ca&s;e &s;hot; mo&s;t of <MILESTONE N="$0"> their Cannoneers were killed, and the General of their Ordnance taken Pri&s;oner. This Man, one <HI>Weemes,</HI> a <HI>Scotch-</HI>man, had been as much obliged by the King, as a Man of His condition could be, and in a man|ner very unpopular: for he was made Ma&s;ter Gunner of <HI>England,</HI> with a Pen&s;ion of three hundred pounds <HI>per annum</HI> for his life (which was looked upon as &s;ome di&s;re&s;pect to the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation) and having never done the King the lea&s;t Service, he took the fir&s;t opportunity to Di&s;&s;erve him; and having been engaged again&s;t him, from the beginning of the Rebellion, he was now preferr'd by them, for his eminent Di&s;loyalty, to be General of the Ordnance in the Army of S^r <HI>William Waller;</HI> who was very much advi&s;ed by him in all matters of Importance. Be|&s;ides <HI>Weemes,</HI> there was taken Pri&s;oner <HI>Baker,</HI> Lieutenant Colonel
<PB N="386" REF="4390">
to S^r <HI>William Waller</HI>'s own Regiment, and five or &s;ix Lieutenant Co|lonels, and Captains, of as good Names as were among&s;t them; with many Lieutenants, En&s;igns, and Cornets, Quarterma&s;ters; and above one hundred Common Soldiers; many more being &s;lain in the Charge. The Earl pur&s;ued them as far as the Bridge; over which he forced them to retire, in &s;pite of their Dragoons, which were placed there to make good their Retreat: all which fled with them, or before. And &s;o the Earl, having clear'd that &s;ide of the River, and not knowing how far he was from the Army, retired, as he had good rea&s;on to do; having lo&s;t, in this notable Action, two Colonels, S^r <HI>William Boteler,</HI> and S^r <HI>Wil|liam Clarke,</HI> both Gentlemen of <HI>Kent,</HI> of fair Fortunes, who had rai&s;ed, <MILESTONE N="10"> and arm'd their Regiments at their own Charge; who were both kill'd dead upon the place, with one Captain more of another Regiment, and not above fourteen Common Soldiers.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> di&s;cover'd that Party of the Enemies Hor&s;e, which had found a pa&s;&s;age over the River a mile below, to follow him in the Rear; and pre&s;ently faced about with tho&s;e Regiments of his Brigade. Upon which, without enduring the Charge, the whole Body betook them&s;elves to flight, and got over the pa&s;s they had &s;o newly been acquainted with, with little lo&s;s, becau&s;e they pre|vented the Danger; though many of them, when they were got over, <MILESTONE N="20"> continued their flight &s;o far, as if they were &s;till pur&s;ued, that they never return'd again to their Army. The Lord <HI>Bernard,</HI> with the King's Troop, &s;eeing there was no Enemy left on that &s;ide, drew up in a large Field oppo&s;ite to the Bridge; where he &s;tood, whil&s;t the Cannon, on the other &s;ide, play'd upon him, until his Maje&s;ty and the re&s;t of the Ar|my pa&s;&s;ed by them, and drew into a Body upon the Fields near <HI>Wil&s;cot. Waller</HI> in&s;tantly quitted <HI>Cropredy,</HI> and drew up his whole Army upon the high grounds, which are between <HI>Cropredy</HI> and <HI>Hanwell,</HI> oppo&s;ite to the King's Quarters about a mile; the River of <HI>Cherwel,</HI> and &s;ome <MILESTONE N="$0"> low grounds, being between both Armies; which had a full view of each other.</P>
<P>IT was now about three of the Clock in the Afternoon, the Wea|ther very fair, and very warm (it being the 29^t^h day of <HI>June)</HI> and the King's Army being now together, his Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd to pro&s;ecute his good Fortune, and to go to the Enemy, &s;ince They would not come to Him: and to that purpo&s;e, &s;ent two good Parties, to make way for him to pa&s;s both at <HI>Cropredy-</HI>Bridge, and the other pa&s;s a mile below; over which the Enemy had &s;o newly pa&s;&s;ed: both which places were &s;trongly guarded by them. To <HI>Cropredy</HI> they &s;ent &s;uch &s;trong Bodies of Foot, to relieve each other as they &s;hould be pre&s;&s;ed, that tho&s;e &s;ent by the King thither could make no Impre&s;&s;ion upon them; but were repul&s;ed, till the Night came, and &s;evered them; all Parties being tired with the Duty of the Day. But they who were &s;ent to the other pa&s;s, a mile below, after a &s;hort Re&s;i&s;tance, gained it, and a Mill adjoyning&punc; where, after they had kill'd &s;ome, they took the re&s;t Pri&s;oners; an$ from thence, did not only defend them&s;elves, that, and the next Day but did the Enemy much hurt; expecting &s;till that their Fellows &s;houl$ ma&s;ter the other pa&s;s, that &s;o they might advance together.</P>
<P>HERE the King was prevailed with to make trial of another Exp$+dient. Some Men, from the Conference they had with the Pri&s;one$ others from other Intelligence, made no doubt, but that if a Me&s;&s;ag$ were now &s;ent of Grace and Pardon to all the Officers and Soldiers $
<PB N="387" REF="4400">
that Army, they would forthwith lay down their Armes: and it was very notorious, that Multitudes ran every day from thence. How this Me&s;&s;age &s;hould be &s;ent, &s;o that it might be effectually deliver'd, was the only Que&s;tion that remain'd: <Q>and it was agreed, &startq;&endq; that S^r <HI>Edward Walker</HI> (who was both Garter King at Armes,</Q> <Q>and Secretary to the Council of War) &startq;&endq; &s;hould be &s;ent to publi&s;h that his Maje&s;ties Grace.</Q> But he wi&s;ely de&s;ired, <Q>&startq;&endq; that a Trumpet might be fir&s;t &s;ent for a Pa&s;s;</Q> the barbarity of that People being notorious, that they regarded not the Laws of Armes, or of Nations. Whereupon a Trumpet was &s;ent to S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> <Q>to de&s;ire &startq;a &s;afe Conduct for a Gentleman, who&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;hould deliver a gracious Me&s;&s;age from his Maje&s;ty.</Q> After two hours Con&s;ideration, he return'd An&s;wer, <Q>&startq;that he had no power to receive any Me&s;&s;age of Grace, or Favour from his Maje&s;ty, without the Con|&s;ent of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> to whom his&endq; Maje&s;ty,</Q> if he plea&s;ed, might make his addre&s;&s;es. And a&s;&s;oon as the Trumpet was gone, as an Evidence of his Re&s;olution, he cau&s;ed above twenty &s;hot of his greate&s;t Cannon to be made at the King's Army, and as near the place as they could, where his Maje&s;ty u&s;ed t$ be.</P>
<P>WHEN both Armies had &s;tood upon the &s;ame ground, and in the &s;ame Po&s;ture, for the &s;pace of two Days, they both drew off to a greater <MILESTONE N="$0"> Di&s;tance from each other; and, from that time, never &s;aw each other. It then quickly appear'd, by <HI>Waller</HI>'s &s;till keeping more aloof from the King, and his marching up and down from <HI>Buckingham,</HI> &s;ometimes towards <HI>Northampton,</HI> and &s;ometimes towards <HI>Warwick,</HI> that he was without other De&s;ign, than of recruiting his Army; and that the De|feat of that day at <HI>Cropredy</HI> was much greater, than it then appear'd to be; and that it even broke the heart of his Army. And it is very pro|bable, that if the King, after he had re&s;ted and refre&s;hed his Men three or four days, which was very nece&s;&s;ary, in regard they were exceedingly tired with continual Duty, be&s;ides that the Provi&s;ions would not hold <MILESTONE N="30"> longer in the &s;ame Quarters, had followed <HI>Waller,</HI> when it was evident He would not follow the King, he might have de&s;troyed that Army without fighting: for it appear'd afterwards, without it's being pur&s;ued, that within fourteen days after that Action at <HI>Cropredy, Waller</HI>'s Army, that before con&s;i&s;ted of eight thou&s;and, was &s;o much wa&s;ted, that there remain'd not with him half that Number.</P>
<P>BUT the truth is, from the time that the King di&s;cover'd that mu|tinous Spirit in the Officers, govern'd by <HI>Wilmot,</HI> at <HI>Buckingham,</HI> he was un&s;atisfied with the Temper of his own Army, and did not de&s;ire a through Engagement, till he had a little time to reform &s;ome, whom <MILESTONE N="$0"> he re&s;olv'd never more heartily to tru&s;t; and to undeceive others, who, he knew, were mi&s;led without any malice, or evil Intention. But when he now found him&s;elf &s;o much at Liberty from two great Armies, which had &s;o &s;treightly encompa&s;&s;ed him, within little more than a Month; and that he had, upon the matter, defeated one of them, and reduced it to a State, in which it could, for the pre&s;ent, do him little harm; his heart was at no ea&s;e, with apprehen&s;ion of the terrible fright the Queen would be in (who was newly deliver'd of a Daughter, that was afterwards Married to the Duke of <HI>Orleans)</HI> when &s;he &s;aw the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> before the Walls of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and &s;hould be at the &s;ame time in|form'd, that <HI>Waller</HI> was with another Army in pur&s;uit of him&s;elf. His Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd therefore, with all po&s;&s;ible Expedition, to follow the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> in hopes that he &s;hould be able to fight a Battle with him,
<PB N="388" REF="4410">
before <HI>Waller</HI> &s;hould be in a Condition to follow him: and his own &s;trength would be much improv'd, by a Conjunction with Prince <HI>Mau|rice;</HI> who, though he retired before <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> would be well able, by the North of <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> to meet the King, when he &s;hould know that he marched that way.</P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty had no &s;ooner taken this Re&s;olution, than he gave no|tice of it to the Lords of the Council at <HI>Oxford;</HI> and &s;ent an Expre&s;s into the We&s;t, to inform the Queen of it; who, by the way, carried Or|ders to the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> <Q>&startq;to draw what Men he could out of <HI>Mon|mouth-&s;hire,</HI> and South <HI>Wales,</HI> into <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> that him&s;elf might meet <MILESTONE N="10"> his Maje&s;ty with as many as he could po&s;&s;ibly draw out of that Gar|ri&s;on.&endq;</Q> So, without any delay, the whole Army, with what Expedi|tion was po&s;&s;ible, marched towards the We&s;t over the <HI>Cot&s;wold</HI> to <HI>Ci|rence&s;ter;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King marches to|wards the We&s;t.</NOTE> and &s;o to <HI>Bath;</HI> where he arrived on the 15^t^h day of <HI>July,</HI> and &s;tayed there one whole day, to refre&s;h his Army; which &s;tood enough in need of it.</P>
<P>THE King had &s;carce marched two days We&s;tward, when he was &s;urpri&s;ed with ill news from the North; for, after he had, by an Expre&s;s from <HI>Oxford,</HI> receiv'd intelligence, <Q>&startq;that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had not only&endq; reliev'd <HI>York,</HI></Q> but totally defeated the <HI>Scots,</HI> with many particulars to confirm it (all which was &s;o much believ'd there, that they had made <MILESTONE N="20"> publick Fires of Joy for the Victory) he now receiv'd quite contrary In|formation, and was too &s;urely convinced, that his whole Army was defeated. It was very true, that, after many great and noble Actions perform'd by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> in the Relief of <HI>Latham,</HI> and the Reduction of <HI>Bolton,</HI> and all other places in that large County <HI>(Manche&s;ter</HI> only excepted) in which the Rebels lo&s;t very many, much Blood having been &s;hed, in taking places by A&s;&s;ault, which were too ob&s;tinately defended; the Prince had marched out of <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> with &s;o good Reputation, and had given his Orders &s;o effectually to <HI>Goring,</HI> who lay in <HI>Lincoln|&s;hire</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> with that Body of Hor&s;e that belonged to the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle</HI>'s Army, that they happily joyn'd him; and marched together towards <HI>York,</HI> with &s;uch Expedition, that the Enemy was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed, that they found it nece&s;&s;ary to rai&s;e the Siege in Confu&s;ion enough; and leaving one whole &s;ide of the Town free, drew to the other &s;ide, in great Di&s;order and Con&s;ternation; there being irreconcilable differences, and jealou&s;ies, between the Officers, and, indeed, between the Nations: the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> re&s;olving to joyn no more with the <HI>Scots,</HI> and They, on the other &s;ide, as weary of Their Company, and Di&s;cipline; &s;o that the Prince had done his Work; and if he had &s;ate &s;till, the Enemies great <MILESTONE N="40"> Army would have moulder'd to nothing, and been expo&s;ed to any ad|vantage his Highne&s;s would take of them.</P>
<P>BUT the di&s;mal Fate of the Kingdom would not permit &s;o much So|briety <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An Account of the Battle of</HI> Mar&s;ton|moor.</NOTE> of Coun&s;el: One &s;ide of the Town was no &s;ooner free, by which there was an entire Communication with tho&s;e in the Town, and all Provi&s;ion brought in abundantly out of the Country, but the Prince, without con&s;ulting with the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> or any of the Of|ficers within the Town, &s;ent for all the Soldiers to draw out, and put the whole Army in Battalia, on that &s;ide where the Enemy was drawn up; who had no other hope to pre&s;erve them but a pre&s;ent Battle, to prevent the reproaches and mutinies which di&s;tracted them.

<P>THE Marquis him&s;elf, and his brave Brother, S^r <HI>Charles Cavendi&s;h</HI> (who was a Man of the noble&s;t, and large&s;t mind, though the lea&s;t, and mo&s;t inconvenient Body that liv'd) Charged in the head of a Troop of Gentlemen, who came out of the Town with him, with as much gal|lantry and courage, as Men could do. But it was &s;o late i$ the Even|ing before the Battle begun, that the Night quickly fell upon them; and the Generals return'd into the Town, not enough knowing their own lo&s;s, and perform'd very few Complements each to other.

<P>THIS may be &s;aid of it, that the like was never done, or heard, or read of before; that two great Generals, whereof one had &s;till a good Army left, his Hor&s;e, by their not having perform'd their Duty, re|maining upon the matter entire, and much the greater part of his Foot having retired into the Town, the great Execution having faln upon the Northern Foot; and the other, having the ab&s;olute Commi&s;&s;ion over the Northern Counties, and very many Con&s;iderable places in them &s;till remaining under his Obedience, &s;hould both agree in nothing el&s;e, but in leaving that good City, and the whole Country, as a prey to the Enemy; who had not yet the Courage to believe that they had the Vi|ctory; <MILESTONE N="40"> the <HI>Scots</HI> having been &s;o totally routed (as hath been &s;aid before) their General made Pri&s;oner by a Con&s;table, and detained in Cu&s;tody, till mo&s;t part of the next day was pa&s;t; and mo&s;t of the Officers, and Army, having marched, or run above ten miles Northward, before they had News that they might &s;ecurely return: And though the Hor&s;e under <HI>Fairfax</HI> and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> had wone the day, yet they were both much wounded, and many others of the be&s;t Officers kill'd, or &s;o maim'd that they could not, in any &s;hort time, have done more hurt: &s;o that if there had been any Agreement to have concealed their lo&s;s, which might have been done to a good Degree (for the Enemy was not po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed <MILESTONE N="30"> of the Field, but was drawn off at a di&s;tance, not knowing what the Hor&s;e, which had done &s;o little, might do the next Day) there might probably many Advantages have appear'd, which were not at the In|&s;tant
<PB N="390" REF="4440">
in view; however, they might Both have done that as &s;ecurely af|terwards, as they did then un&s;ea&s;onably.</P>
<P>BUT neither of them were Friends to &s;uch Deliberation; but, a&s;&s;oon as they were refre&s;hed with a little &s;leep, they both &s;ent a Me&s;&s;enger to each other, allmo&s;t at the &s;ame time; <Q>the one, &startq;that he was re&s;olv'd, that Morning, to march away with his Hor&s;e, and as many Foot as&endq; he had left;</Q> <Q>and the other, &startq;that he would, in that In&s;tant, repair to&endq; the Sea &s;ide, and tran&s;port him&s;elf beyond the Seas;</Q> both which they immediately perform'd; the Marquis making ha&s;t to <HI>Scarborough,</HI> there embarqued in a poor Ve&s;&s;el, and arriv'd at <HI>Hamburgh:</HI> the Prince, with his Army, begun his March the &s;ame Morning towards <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> And &s;o <HI>York</HI> was left to the di&s;cretion of S^r <HI>Thomas Glemham,</HI> the Governour thereof, to do with it as He thought fit; being in a Condition only to deliver it up with more Decency, not to defend it again&s;t an Enemy that would require it.</P>
<P>WHEREAS, if Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had &s;tayed with the Army he marched away with, at any rea&s;onable Di&s;tance, it would have been long before the Jealou&s;ies, and Breaches, which were between the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> and <HI>Scotch</HI> Armies, would have been enough compo&s;ed to have agreed upon the renewing the Siege; &s;uch great quantities of Provi&s;ion being already <MILESTONE N="2$"> brought into the Town: and the <HI>Scots</HI> talked of nothing but returning into their own Country, where the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> had kindled already a Fire, which the Parliament of <HI>Edenborough</HI> could not quench. <Q>But the certain Intelligence, &startq;that the Prince was marched away with|out thought of returning, and that the Marquis had embarqued him|&s;elf,&endq;</Q> reconciled them &s;o far, (and nothing el&s;e could) that, after two days, they return'd to the Po&s;ts they had before had in the Siege; and &s;o &s;treighten'd the Town, that the Governour, when he had no hope of Relief, within a Fortnight was compelled to deliver it up, upon as good <NOTE PLACE="marg">York <HI>deli|ver'd to the Farliament Forces.</HI></NOTE> Articles for the Town, and the Gentry that were in it, and for Him&s;elf, <MILESTONE N="3$"> and the few Soldiers he had left, as he could propo&s;e: and &s;o he march'd with all his Troops to <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> which he afterwards defended with very remarkable Circum&s;tances of Courage, Indu&s;try, and Patience.</P>
<P>THE Times afterwards grew &s;o bad, and the King's Affairs &s;ucceeded &s;o ill, that there was no Opportunity to call either of tho&s;e two great Per&s;ons to Account for what they had done, or what they had left un|done. Nor did either of them ever think fit to make any particular Re|lation of the Grounds of their Proceeding, or the cau&s;es of their mi&s;|adventures, by way of Excu&s;e to the King, or for their own Vindica|tion. Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> only to his Friends, and after the Murther of the King, produced a Letter in the King's own hand, which he receiv'd when he was upon his March from <HI>Lanca&s;hire</HI> towards <HI>York;</HI> <Q>in which his Maje&s;ty &s;aid, &startq;that his Affairs were in &s;o very ill a State, that it would not be enough, though his Highne&s;s rai&s;ed the Siege from <HI>York,</HI> if he had not likewi&s;e beaten the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army; which he under&s;tood to amount to no le&s;s than a peremptory Order to Fight, upon what&endq; di&s;advantage &s;oever:</Q> and added, <Q>&startq;that the di&s;advantage was &s;o great, the Enemy being &s;o much Superior in number, it was no wonder he&endq; lo&s;t the day.</Q> But as the King's Letter would not bear that &s;ence, &s;o the greate&s;t Cau&s;e of the misfortune was the precipitate entring upon the Battle, a&s;&s;oon as the Enemy drew off; and without con&s;ulting at all with the Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle,</HI> and his Officers; who mu&s;t needs know more of the Enemy, and con&s;equently how they were be&s;t to be
<PB N="391" REF="4450">
dealt with, than his Highne&s;s could do. For he &s;aw not the Marquis, till, upon his Summons, he came into the Field, in the head of a Troop of Gentlemen, as a private Captain, when the Battle was ranged; and which, after a very &s;hort &s;alutation, immediately begun; tho&s;e of the Marquis's Army, who came out of the Town, being placed upon the ground left by the Prince, and a&s;&s;ign'd to them; which much indi&s;po&s;ed both Officers and Soldiers to the work in hand, and towards tho&s;e with whom they were to joyn in it.</P>
<P>THEN it was too late in the day to begin the Fight, if all the other ill circum&s;tances had been away; for it was pa&s;t three in the Afternoon: whereas, if it had been deferr'd till next Morning, in which time a full <MILESTONE N="10"> con&s;ultation might have been had, and the Officers and Soldiers grown a little acquainted with each other, better &s;ucce&s;s might have been rea|&s;onably expected; nor would the confu&s;ion and con&s;ternation the other Armies were then in, which was the only excu&s;e for the pre&s;ent En|gagement, have been the le&s;s; but, on the contrary, very much im|prov'd by the delay; for the bitterne&s;s and animo&s;ity between $$e Chief Commanders was &s;uch, that a great part of the Army was marched &s;ix miles, when it appear'd, by the Princes manner of drawing his Army together to that ground, that his re&s;olution was to Fight: the &s;peedy <MILESTONE N="$0"> Intelligence whereof prevailed, and nothing el&s;e could, with tho&s;e who were gone &s;o far, to return; and with the re&s;t, to unite and concur in an Action, that, in human rea&s;on, could only pre&s;erve them: and if that opportunity had not then been &s;o unhappily offer'd, it was generally believ'd that the <HI>Scots</HI> would, the next morning, have continued their March Northward; and the Earl of <HI>Manchester</HI> would have been ne|ce&s;&s;itated to have made his retreat, as well as he could, into his A&s;&s;o|ciated Counties; and it would have been in the Princes power to have cho&s;en which of them he would have de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>BUT then of all the re&s;t, his going away the next Morning with all <MILESTONE N="$$"> his Troops, in that manner, was mo&s;t unexcu&s;able; becau&s;e mo&s;t pre|judicial, and mo&s;t ruinous to the King's Affairs in tho&s;e parts. Nor did tho&s;e Troops ever after bring any con&s;iderable advantage to the King's Service, but moulder'd away by degrees, and the Officers, whereof many were Gentlemen of Quality and great merit, were kill'd upon beating up of Quarters, and little Actions not worth their pre&s;ence. The truth is, the Prince had &s;ome &s;ecret Intimation of the Marquis's purpo&s;e of immediately leaving the Town, and embarking him&s;elf for the parts beyond the Seas, before the Marquis him&s;elf &s;ent him word of it; upon which, in great pa&s;&s;ion and rage, he &s;ent him notice of his re&s;olution <MILESTONE N="$0"> pre&s;ently to be gone, that he who had the Command of all tho&s;e parts, and thereby an obligation not to de&s;ert his Charge, might be without any imagination, that the Prince would take &s;uch a di&s;tracted Govern|ment upon him, and leave him any Excu&s;e for his departure: and if in this joynt di&s;temper, with which they were both tran&s;ported, any Per&s;ons of di&s;cretion and honour, had interpo&s;ed, they might in all probability, have prevailed with both, for a good under&s;tanding be|tween them, or at lea&s;t for the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion of their pre&s;ent Re&s;olutions, and con&s;idering what might be&s;t be done. But they both re&s;olv'd &s;o &s;oon, and &s;o &s;oon executed what they re&s;olv'd, that very few had the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion of their Intentions, till they were both out of di&s;tance to have their Conver&s;ion attempted.</P>
<P>ALL that can be &s;aid for the Marquis is, that he was &s;o utterly tired
<PB N="392" REF="4460">
with a condition and employment &s;o contrary to his Humour, Nature, and Education, that he did not at all con&s;ider the means, or the way that would let him out of it, and free him for ever from having more to do with it. And it was a greater wonder, that he &s;u&s;tain'd the vexa|tion and fatigue of it &s;o long, than that he broke from it with &s;o little circum&s;pection. He was a very fine Gentleman, active, and full of Cou|rage, and mo&s;t accompli&s;h'd in tho&s;e Qualities of Hor&s;man&s;hip, Dancing, and Fencing, which accompany a good breeding; in which his delight was. Be&s;ides that he was amorous in Poetry, and Mu&s;ick, to which he indulged the greate&s;t part of his time; and nothing could have tempted him out of tho&s;e paths of plea&s;ure, which he enjoy'd in a full and am|ple <MILESTONE N="10"> fortune, but Honour and Ambition to &s;erve the King when he &s;aw him in di&s;tre&s;s, and abandon'd by mo&s;t of tho&s;e who were in the highe&s;t degree obliged to him, and by him. He lov'd Monarchy, as it was the foundation and &s;upport of his own greatne&s;s, and the Church, as it was well con&s;tituted for the &s;plendour and &s;ecurity of the Crown; and Re|ligion, as it cheri&s;hed, and maintain'd that Order and Obedience that was nece&s;&s;ary to Both; without any other pa&s;&s;ion for the particular Opinions which were grown up in it, and di&s;tingui&s;hed it into Parties, than as he dete&s;ted what&s;oever was like to di&s;turb the publick Peace. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>HE had a particular Reverence for the Per&s;on of the King, and the more extraordinary Devotion for that of the Prince, as he had had the honour to be tru&s;ted with his Education as his Governour; for which Office, as he excelled in &s;ome, &s;o he wanted other Qualifications. Though he had retired from his great Tru&s;t, and from the Court, to decline the in&s;upportable Envy which the powerful Faction had contracted again&s;t him, yet the King was no &s;ooner nece&s;&s;itated to po&s;&s;e&s;s him&s;elf of &s;ome place of &s;trength, and to rai&s;e &s;ome Force for his Defence, but the Earl of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle</HI> (he was made Marquis afterwards) obeyed his fir&s;t call; and, with great expedition and dexterity, &s;ei&s;ed upon that Town; when <MILESTONE N="30"> till then there was not one Port Town in <HI>England,</HI> that avow'd their obedience to the King: and he then pre&s;ently rai&s;ed &s;uch Regiments of Hor&s;e and Foot, as were nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ent &s;tate of Affairs; all which was done purely by his own Intere&s;t, and the concurrence of his numerous Allies in tho&s;e Northern Parts; who with all alacrity obeyed his Commands, without any charge to the King; which he was not able to &s;upply.</P>
<P>AND after the Battle of <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> when the Rebels grew &s;o &s;trong in <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> by the influence their Garri&s;on of <HI>Hull</HI> had upon both the Ea&s;t and We&s;t riding there, that it behoved the King pre&s;ently to make <MILESTONE N="$$"> a General, who might unite all tho&s;e Northern Counties in his Service, he could not choo&s;e any Man &s;o fit for it, as the Earl of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> who was not only po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a pre&s;ent Force, and of that important Town, but had a greater Reputation and Intere&s;t in <HI>York-&s;hire</HI> it &s;elf, than, at that pre&s;ent, any other Man had: the Earl of <HI>Cumberland</HI> be|ing at that time, though of entire Affection to the King, much decayed in the vigour of his Body, and his Mind, and unfit for that Activity which the Sea&s;on required. And it cannot be denied, that the Earl of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> by his quick march with his Troops, a&s;&s;oon as he had re|ceiv'd his Commi&s;&s;ion to be General, and in the depth of Winter, re|deem'd, <MILESTONE N="$$"> or re&s;cued the City of <HI>York</HI> from the Rebels, when they look'd upon it as their own, and had it even within their gra&s;p: and a&s;&s;oon as he was Ma&s;ter of it, he rai&s;ed Men apace, and drew an Army together,
<PB REF="4470">
<FIGURE>
</FIGURE>
<PB N="393" REF="4480">
with which he fought many Battles, in which he had allways (this la&s;t only excepted) Succe&s;s and Victory.</P>
<P>HE liked the Pomp, and ab&s;olute Authority of a General well, and pre&s;erv'd the dignity of it to the full; and for the di&s;charge of the out|ward State, and Circum&s;tances of it, in acts of Courte&s;y, Affability, Bounty, and Genero&s;ity, he abounded; which, in the infancy of a War, became him, and made him, for &s;ome time, very acceptable to Men of all conditions. But the &s;ub&s;tantial part, and fatigue of a General, he did not in any degree under&s;tand (being utterly unacquainted with War) nor could &s;ubmit to; but referr'd all matters of that Nature to the di&s;|cretion <MILESTONE N="10"> of his Lieutenant General <HI>King;</HI> who, no doubt, was an Officer of great experience and ability, yet, being a <HI>Scotch-</HI>man, was, in that con|juncture, upon more di&s;advantage than he would have been, if the Ge|neral him&s;elf had been more intent upon his Command. In all Actions of the Field he was &s;till pre&s;ent, and never ab&s;ent in any Battle; in all which he gave In&s;tances of an invincible courage and fearle&s;sne&s;s in dan|ger; in which the expo&s;ing him&s;elf notoriou&s;ly did &s;ometimes change the fortune of the day, when his Troops begun to give ground. Such Articles of Action were no &s;ooner over, than he retired to his delight|ful Company, Mu&s;ick, or his &s;ofter plea&s;ures, to all which he was &s;o <MILESTONE N="20"> indulgent, and to his ea&s;e, that he would not be interrupted upon what occa&s;ion &s;oever; in&s;omuch as he &s;ometimes denied Admi&s;&s;ion to the Chiefe&s;t Officers of the Army, even to General <HI>King</HI> him&s;elf, for two days together; from whence many Inconveniencies fell out.</P>
<P>FROM the beginning, he was without any reverence or regard for the Privy Council, with few of whom he had any acquaintance; but was of the other Soldiers mind, that all the bu&s;ine&s;s ought to be done by Councils of War, and was allways angry when there were any Over|tures of a Treaty; and therefore, e&s;pecially after the Queen had landed in <HI>York-&s;hire</HI> and &s;tayed &s;o long there, he con&s;ider'd any Orders he re|ceiv'd <MILESTONE N="30"> from <HI>Oxford,</HI> though from the King him&s;elf, more negligently than he ought to have done; and when he thought him&s;elf &s;ure of <HI>Hull,</HI> and was &s;ure that he &s;hould be then Ma&s;ter entirely of all the North, he had no mind to march nearer the King (as he had then Orders to march into the A&s;&s;ociated Counties, when, upon the taking of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> his Maje&s;ty had a purpo&s;e to have marched towards <HI>London</HI> on the other &s;ide) out of apprehen&s;ion that he &s;hould be eclip&s;ed by the Court, and his Authority over&s;hadow'd by the Superiority of Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> from whom he de&s;ired to be at di&s;tance: Yet when he found him&s;elf in di&s;tre&s;s, and nece&s;&s;itated to draw his Army within the Walls of <HI>York,</HI> <MILESTONE N="$0"> and &s;aw no way to be reliev'd but by Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who had then done great feats of Armes in the relief of <HI>Newark,</HI> and afterwards in his Ex|pedition into <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> where he was at that time, he writ to the King to <HI>Oxford,</HI> either upon the knowledge that the ab&s;olutene&s;s, and illimitedne&s;s of his Commi&s;&s;ion was generally much &s;poken of, or out of the con&s;cience of &s;ome di&s;cour&s;e of his own to that purpo&s;e; which might have been reported; <Q>&startq;that he hoped his Maje&s;ty did believe, that he would never make the lea&s;t &s;cruple to obey the Grandchild of King&endq; <HI>James:</HI></Q> and a&s;&s;uredly, if the Prince had cultivated the good inclina|tions the Marquis had towards him, with any civil and gracious Con|de&s;cen&s;ions, he would have found him full of duty and regard to his Service, and Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>BUT the &s;trange manner of the Prince's coming, and undeliberated

throwing him&s;elf, and all the King's hopes into that &s;uddain and unne|ce&s;&s;ary Engagement, by which all the force the Marquis had rai&s;ed, and with &s;o many difficulties pre&s;erv'd, was in a moment ca&s;t away and de|&s;troy'd, &s;o tran&s;ported him with pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;pair, that he could not compo&s;e him&s;elf to think of beginning the work again, and involving him&s;elf in the &s;ame undelightful condition of Life, from which he might now be free. He hoped his pa&s;t meritorious Actions, might outweigh his pre&s;ent abandoning the thought of future Action; and &s;o, without farther con&s;ideration, as hath been &s;aid, he tran&s;ported him&s;elf out of the Kingdom, and took with him General <HI>King;</HI> upon whom, they who <MILESTONE N="10"> were content to &s;pare the Marquis, <Q>poured out all the Reproaches of &startq;&endq; Infidelity,</Q> Trea&s;on, and Conjunction with his Country Men; which, without doubt, was the effect of the univer&s;al di&s;content, and the mi|&s;erable condition to which the People of tho&s;e Northern Parts were on the &s;uddain reduced, without the lea&s;t foundation, or ground for any &s;uch reproach: and as he had, throughout the whole Cour&s;e of his Life, been generally reputed a Man of Honour, and had exerci&s;ed the highe&s;t Commands under the King of <HI>Sweden</HI> with extraordinary ability, and &s;ucce&s;s, &s;o he had been pro&s;ecuted by &s;ome of his Country Men with the highe&s;t malice, from his very coming into the King's Service; and <MILESTONE N="20"> the &s;ame malice pur&s;ued him after he had left the Kingdom, even to his death.</P>
<P>THE lo&s;s of <HI>England</HI> came &s;o &s;oon to be lamented, that the lo&s;s of <HI>York,</HI> or the too &s;oon de&s;erting the Northern Parts, were comparatively no more &s;poken of; and the con&s;tant and noble behaviour of the Mar|quis in the change of his fortune, and his chearful &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion to all the &s;treights, nece&s;&s;ities, and di&s;comforts, which are in&s;eparable from ba|ni&s;hment, without the lea&s;t application to the U&s;urpers, who were po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of his whole E&s;tate, and upon which they committed all ima|ginable and irreparable Wa&s;t, in de&s;troying all his Woods of very great <MILESTONE N="30"> Value, and who were &s;till equally abhorr'd, and de&s;pi&s;ed by him; with his readine&s;s and alacrity, again to have embarked him&s;elf in the King's Quarrel, upon the fir&s;t rea&s;onable occa&s;ion, &s;o perfectly reconciled all good Men to him, that they rather ob&s;erv'd, what he had Done, and Suffer'd for the King and for his Country, without farther inquiring what he had Omitted to do, or been over&s;een in doing.</P>
<P>THIS fatal blow, which &s;o much changed the King's condition, that till then was very hopeful, made not &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon his Ma|je&s;ty, but that it made him pur&s;ue his former Re&s;olution, to follow the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> with the more impatience; having now in truth nothing el&s;e to do. But being informed that the Earl had not made any long marches, and that the Queen, upon the fir&s;t News of the Earls draw|ing near, though &s;he had been little more than a fortnight deliver'd, had left <HI>Exeter,</HI> and was removed into <HI>Cornwal;</HI> from whence, in a &s;hort time, &s;he embarked for <HI>France</HI> (the Prince of <HI>Orange</HI> having &s;ent <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Queen retires into</HI> France.</NOTE> &s;ome <HI>Dutch</HI> Ships of War, to attend her Commands in the Harbour of <HI>Falmouth;</HI> and from thence her Maje&s;ty tran&s;ported her &s;elf) his Maje&s;ty march'd more &s;lowly, that he might encrea&s;e his Army from <HI>Bristol,</HI> and other places; making no doubt, but that he &s;hould engage the Army of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who was already near <HI>Exeter,</HI> before he &s;hould be able to return to <HI>London.</HI></P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s good Fortune now begun to decline: he had not proceeded with his accu&s;tom'd warine&s;s, and skill; but run into
<PB N="395" REF="4500">
Labyrinths, from whence he could not disintangle him&s;elf. When he had marched to the length of <HI>Exeter,</HI> which he had &s;ome thought of Be&s;ieging, without any imagination that he could find an Enemy to con|tend with him, having left the King in &s;o ill a condition, and S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> with &s;o good an Army waiting upon him, <Q>he had the News of the &startq;di&s;appointment S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> had receiv'd; and that the King was come with his whole Army into the We&s;t in pur&s;uit of him, with|out being follow'd by <HI>Waller,</HI> or any Troops to di&s;quiet or retard his&endq; March;</Q> which exceedingly &s;urpri&s;ed him, and made him &s;u&s;pect that the Parliament it &s;elf had betrayed him, and con&s;pired his ruin.</P>
<P>THE Jealou&s;ies were now indeed grown very great between them; <MILESTONE N="10"> the Parliament looking upon his march into the We&s;t, and leaving <HI>Waller,</HI> to whom they intended the other Province, to follow the King, but as a Declaration that he would no more fight again&s;t the Per&s;on of the King; and the Earl, on the other &s;ide, had well ob&s;erv'd the dif|ference betwixt the care and affection the Parliament expre&s;&s;ed for, and towards His Army, and the other under the Command of the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter;</HI> which they &s;et &s;o great a price upon, that he though they would not &s;o much care what became of His. Otherwi&s;e, it could not be po&s;&s;ible, that upon &s;o little a bru&s;h as <HI>Waller</HI> had &s;u&s;tain'd, he could not be able to follow, and di&s;turb the King, in a Country &s;o enclo&s;ed, <MILESTONE N="20"> as he mu&s;t pa&s;s through. In this unexpected &s;treight, upon the fir&s;t re|ception of the News, he re&s;olv'd to return back, and meet and fight with the King, either before he enter'd <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> or <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire;</HI> in either of which places he could not be &s;treighten'd in room, or provi&s;ions, or be compelled to fight in a place di&s;advantageous, or when he had no mind to it; and if he had pur&s;ued this Re&s;olution, he had done prudently. But the Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> who was a General Officer in his Army, of an in&s;ociable Nature, and impetuous Di&s;po&s;ition, full of contradiction in his Temper, and of Parts &s;o much &s;uperior to any in the Company, that he could too well maintain and ju&s;tify all tho&s;e con|tradictions, <MILESTONE N="30"> po&s;itively oppo&s;ed the return of the Army; <Q>but pre&s;&s;ed, with His confidence, &startq;that the Army &s;hould continue it's March to&endq; <HI>Cornwal;</HI></Q> where he undertook to have &s;o great Intere&s;t, that he made no que&s;tion, <Q>&startq;but the pre&s;ence of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> with his Army, would &s;o unite that County to the Parliaments Service, that it would be ea&s;y to defend the pa&s;&s;es into the whole County (which are not many) in &s;uch a manner, that the King's Army &s;hould never be able to enter into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> nor to retire out of <HI>Devon-&s;hire</HI> without great lo&s;s, nor before the Parliament would &s;end more Forces upon their&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> backs.</Q></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> though inferior in the Army, had much greater credit in the Parliament than the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and the Earl did not think him very kind to him, he being then in great conjunction with S^r <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> whom of all Men the Earl hated, and look'd upon as an Enemy. He had never been in <HI>Cornwal;</HI> &s;o he knew not the Situa|tion of the Country: &s;ome of the Officers, and &s;ome others of that Country (as there were with him four or five Gentlemen of that Coun|try of Intere&s;t) concurr'd fully with the Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> and promi&s;ed great matters, if the Army marched thither: whereupon the Earl de|parted from his own under&s;tanding, and complied with their advice; and &s;o marched the direct way with all his Army, Hor&s;e, Foot, and Can|non, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>marches into</HI> Cornwal.</NOTE> into that narrow County; and pur&s;ued Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> and tho&s;e

<P>AFTER the King had made a &s;mall &s;tay at <HI>Exeter,</HI> where he found his young Daughter, of whom the Queen had been &s;o lately deliver'd, under the care and Government of the Lady <HI>Dalkeith</HI> (&s;hortly after Counte&s;s of <HI>Morton</HI> by the death of her Husband's Father) who had been long before de&s;ign'd by both their Maje&s;ties to that Charge; and having a little refre&s;h'd, and accommodated his Troops, he marched directly to <HI>Cornwal;</HI> where he found the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> in &s;uch a part <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King fol|lows him thi|ther.</NOTE> of the Country on the Sea &s;ide, that he quickly, by the general Conflux and Concour&s;e of the whole People, upon which the Earl had been per|&s;waded &s;o much to depend, found means, with very little fighting, &s;o to &s;treighten his Quarters, that there &s;eem'd little appearance that he could po&s;&s;ibly march away with his Army, or compel the King to fight. He was, upon the matter, inclo&s;ed in, and about <HI>Foy;</HI> whil&s;t the King lay encamped about <HI>Liskard;</HI> and no day pa&s;&s;ed without &s;ome Skir|mi&s;hes; in which the Earl was more di&s;tre&s;&s;ed, and many of his princi|pal Officers taken Pri&s;oners. Here there happen'd an Accident that might very well have turn'd the King's Fortune, and deprived him of all the Advantages which were then in view. The King being allways in the Army him&s;elf, all matters were &s;till debated before him, in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e Coun&s;ellors who were about him; who, being Men of better under&s;tandings and better expre&s;&s;ions than the Officers, com|monly di&s;po&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to Their opinions, at lea&s;t kept him from concurring in every thing which was propo&s;ed by the Officers. The Coun&s;ellors, as hath been &s;aid before, were the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> Secretary of State, and S^r <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> Ma&s;ter of the Rolls; of who&s;e judge|ment the King had more e&s;teem, even with reference to the War, than of mo&s;t of the Officers of the Army; which rai&s;ed an implacable ani|mo&s;ity in the whole Army again&s;t them.</P>
<P>GENERAL <HI>Ruthen,</HI> who by this time was created Earl of <HI>Brentford,</HI> <MILESTONE N="$$"> was General of the Army; but, as hath been &s;aid, both by rea&s;on of his Age, and his extreme deafne&s;s, was not a Man of Coun&s;el or Words; hardly conceiv'd what was propo&s;ed, and as confu&s;edly and ob&s;curely deliver'd his opinion; and could indeed better judge by his Eye than his Ear; and in the Field well knew what was to be done. <HI>Wilmot</HI> was Lieutenant General of the Hor&s;e, and at this time the &s;econd Officer of the Army, and had much more Credit and Authority in it, than any Man; which he had not employed to the King's advantage, as his Ma|je&s;ty believ'd. He was a Man proud, and ambitious, and incapable of being contented; an ordinary Officer in Marches, and governing his Troops. He drank hard, and had a great power over all who did &s;o, which was a great People. He had a more companiable Wit even than his Rival <HI>Goring,</HI> and &s;way'd more among the good fellows, and could by no means endure that the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and S^r <HI>John Colepepper,</HI> &s;hould have &s;o much credit with the King in Councils of War.</P>
<P>THE King had no kindne&s;s for him upon an old account, as remem|bring the part he had acted again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Strafford:</HI> however, he had been induced, upon the Accidents which happen'd afterwards, to repo&s;e tru&s;t in him. This <HI>Wilmot</HI> knew well enough; and fore&s;aw, that he &s;hould be quickly over&s;hadow'd in the War; and therefore de&s;ired to get out of it, by a &s;ea&s;onable Peace; and &s;o, in all his di&s;cour&s;es, urged the nece&s;&s;ity of it, as he had begun in <HI>Buckingham-&s;hire;</HI> <Q>and,

<P>WHETHER his apprehen&s;ions of this, as his jealous n$$ure had much <MILESTONE N="20"> of &s;agacity in it, or his re&s;tle&s;s and mutinous humour, tran&s;ported him, but he gave not the King time to pro&s;ecute that gracious method; but even forced him to a quicker and a rougher remedy: for during the whole march, he di&s;cour&s;ed, in all places, <Q>&startq;that the King mu&s;t &s;end to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to invite him to a conjunction with him, that &s;o the Parliament might be obliged to con&s;ent to a Peace; and pretended, that he had &s;o good Intelligence in that Army, as to know that &s;uch an Invitation would prove effectual, and be acceptable to the Earl; who, he knew, was un&s;atisfied with the Parliaments behaviour to|wards&endq; him:</Q> and he was &s;o indi&s;creet, as to de&s;ire a Gentleman, with <MILESTONE N="$0"> whom he had no intimacy, and who had a Pa&s;s to go beyond the Seas, and mu&s;t go through the Earl's Quarters, <Q>&startq;that he would remember his Service to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and a&s;&s;ure him, that the Army &s;o much de&s;ired Peace, that it &s;hould not be in the Power of any of tho&s;e Per&s;ons about the King to hinder it, if his Lord&s;hip would treat upon&endq; any rea&s;onable Propo&s;itions.</Q> All which kind of carriage and di&s;cour&s;es were quickly repre&s;ented, in their full magnitude, to the King by the Lord <HI>Digby;</HI> and his Maje&s;ties own aver&s;ion kindled any &s;park into a form'd di&s;tru&s;t. So that after the King came into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and had his whole Army drawn up on the top of the Hill, in view of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who was in the bottom, and a Battle expected every day, upon &s;ome new di&s;cour&s;e <HI>Wilmot</HI> made out of Pride and Vanity (for there was not in all the former, the lea&s;t form'd Act of Sedition in his heart) the Knight Mar&s;hal, with the a&s;&s;i&s;tance of <HI>Tom Elliot,</HI> arre&s;ted him in the King's Name of High Trea&s;on; and di&s;mounted him from his Hor&s;e in the head of all the Troops; putting a Guard upon him. He was pre|&s;ently &s;ent Pri&s;oner to <HI>Exeter,</HI> without any other ill effect, which might very rea&s;onably have been apprehended in &s;uch a conjuncture, when he was indeed generally well beloved, and none of them for who&s;e &s;akes $he was thought to be &s;acrificed, were at all e&s;teem'd: yet, I &s;ay, there were no other ill effects of it than a little murmur, which vani&s;hed away.</P>
<P>THE &s;ame day that <HI>Wilmot</HI> was arre&s;ted, the King remov'd another
<PB N="398" REF="4540">
General Officer of his Army, the Lord <HI>Percy;</HI> who had been made Ge|neral of the Ordnance upon very partial, and not enough deliberated Con&s;iderations; and put into that Office the Lord <HI>Hopton;</HI> who&s;e pro|motion was univer&s;ally approv'd; the one having no friend, and the other being univer&s;ally belov'd. Be&s;ides, the Lord <HI>Percy</HI> (who was the fir&s;t that had been created a Baron at <HI>Oxford</HI> upon the Queen's Inter|ce&s;&s;ion; which obliged the King to be&s;tow the &s;ame honour on more Men) had been as much inclined to mutiny, as the Lord <HI>Wilmot;</HI> and was much a bolder Speaker, and had none of tho&s;e faculties, which the other had, of reconciling Men to him. Yet even His removal added <MILESTONE N="10"> to the ill humour of the Army, too much di&s;po&s;ed to di&s;content, and cen&s;uring all that was done: for though he was generally unlov'd, as a proud and &s;upercilious Per&s;on, yet he had allways three or four Per&s;ons of good credit and reputation, who were e&s;teem'd by him, with whom he liv'd very well; and though he did not draw the good fellows to him by drinking, yet he eat well; which, in the General &s;carcity of that time, drew many Votaries to him; who bore very ill the want of his Table, and &s;o were not without &s;ome inclination to murmur even on His behalf.</P>
<P>THE very next day after the&s;e Removals, Colonel <HI>Goring</HI> appear'd; <MILESTONE N="20"> who had waited upon the King the night before, at his Quarters, with Letters from Prince <HI>Rupert:</HI> and then the Army being drawn up, his Maje&s;ty, attended by the principal Officers of the Army, rode to every Divi&s;ion of the Hor&s;e, and there declared, <Q>&startq;that, at the reque&s;t of his Nephew Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and upon his re&s;ignation, he made M^r <HI>Goring</HI> General of the Hor&s;e; and commanded them all to obey him; and for the Lord <HI>Wilmot,</HI> although he had, for very good rea&s;ons, ju&s;tly re|&s;train'd him for the pre&s;ent, yet he had not taken away from him his&endq; Command in the Army;</Q> which Declaration vi&s;ibly rai&s;ed the coun|tenance of the Body of Hor&s;e, more than the King was plea&s;ed with <MILESTONE N="3$"> ob&s;erving: and the very next day the greate&s;t part of the Officers deli|ver'd a Petition, <Q>&startq;that his Maje&s;ty would give them &s;o much light of the Lord <HI>Wilmot</HI>'s Crimes, that they might &s;ee that Them&s;elves were&endq; not &s;u&s;pected,</Q> who had &s;o long obeyed and executed his Orders; which is manife&s;tation enough of the ill di&s;po&s;ition the Army was in, when they were even in view of the Enemy, and of which the King had &s;o much apprehen&s;ion, in re&s;pect of the pre&s;ent po&s;ture he was in, that he was too ea&s;ily per&s;waded to give them a Draught of the Articles, by which he was charged; which though they contained &s;o many Indi&s;cre|tions, Vanities, and In&s;olencies, that wi&s;e and di&s;pa&s;&s;ionate Men thought he had been proceeded with very ju&s;tly, yet generally they &s;eem'd not to make him &s;o very black, as he had been repre&s;ented to be: and when the Articles were &s;ent to him, he return'd &s;o &s;pecious an An&s;wer to them, that made many Men think he had been pro&s;ecuted with &s;everity enough. Yet <HI>Wilmot</HI> him&s;elf, when he &s;aw his old mortal Enemy <HI>Go|ring</HI> put in the Command over him, thought him&s;elf incapable of re+paration, or a full vindication; and therefore de&s;ired leave to retir$ into <HI>France;</HI> and had pre&s;ently a Pa&s;s &s;ent him to that purpo&s;e; o$ which he made u&s;e a&s;&s;oon as he receiv'd it; and &s;o tran&s;ported him&s;el$ out of the Kingdom; which opened the Mouths of many, and made $$ believ'd, that he had been &s;acrificed to &s;ome Faction and Intrigue of th$ Court, without any &s;uch mi&s;demeanour as de&s;erv'd it.</P>

<P>THE Earl receiv'd his Nephew very kindly; who deliver'd the King's Letter to him; which he receiv'd, and read; and being then told by the <MILESTONE N="$0"> Lord <HI>Beauchamp,</HI> that Mon&s;ieur <HI>Richaute,</HI> who was very well known to him, had &s;omewhat to &s;ay to him from the King; the Earl called him into his Chamber, in the pre&s;ence only of the Lord <HI>Beauchamp,</HI> and asked him, <Q>&startq;if he had any thing to &s;ay to him? <HI>Richaute</HI> told him, that his principal bu&s;ine&s;s was to de&s;ire his Permi&s;&s;ion and Pa&s;s, that M^r <HI>Harding</HI> might come to him, who had many things to offer, which,&endq; he pre&s;umed,</Q> would not be unacceptable to him. <Q>The Earl An&s;wer'd in &s;hort, &startq;that he would not permit M^r <HI>Harding</HI> to come to him, nor would he have any Treaty with the King, having receiv'd no Warrant&endq; for it from the Parliament:</Q> upon which, <HI>Richaute</HI> enlarged him&s;elf <MILESTONE N="40"> upon &s;ome particulars, which M^r <HI>Harding</HI> was to have urged, <Q>&startq;of the King's de&s;ire of Peace, of the concurrence of all the Lords, as well tho&s;e at <HI>Oxford,</HI> as in the Army, in the &s;ame de&s;ire of pre&s;erving the King|dom&endq; from a Conque&s;t by the <HI>Scots;</HI></Q> and other di&s;cour&s;e to that pur|po&s;e; <Q>&startq;and of the King's readine&s;s to give him any &s;ecurity for the per|formance&endq; of all he had promi&s;ed.</Q> To all which the Earl An&s;wer'd &s;ul|lenly, <Q>&startq;that according to the Commi&s;&s;ion he had receiv'd, he would de|fend the King's Per&s;on, and Po&s;terity; and that the be&s;t Coun&s;el he&endq; could give him was, to go to his Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>ASSOON as the King receiv'd this Account of his Letter, and &s;aw <MILESTONE N="$0"> there was nothing to be expected by tho&s;e Addre&s;&s;es, he re&s;olv'd to pu&s;h it on the other way, and to Fight with the Enemy a&s;&s;oon as was po&s;&s;i|ble; and &s;o, the next day, drew up all his Army in &s;ight of the Enemy;
<PB N="400" REF="4560">
and had many Skirmi&s;hes between the Hor&s;e of both Armies, till the Enemy quitted that part of a large Heath upon which they &s;tood, and retired to a Hill near the Park of the Lord <HI>Mohun,</HI> at <HI>Boconnocke;</HI> they having the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Hou&s;e, where they Quarter'd conve|niently. That Night both Armies, after they had well view'd each other, lay in the Field; and many are of opinion, that if the King had that day vigorou&s;ly advanced upon the Enemy, to which his Army was well inclined, though upon &s;ome di&s;advantage of ground, they would have been ea&s;ily defeated: for the King's Army was in good heart, and willing to engage; on the contrary, the Earl's &s;eem'd much &s;urpri&s;ed, and in <MILESTONE N="10"> confu&s;ion, to &s;ee the other Army &s;o near them. But &s;uch cen&s;ures all|ways attend &s;uch Conjunctures, and find fault for what is Not done, as well as with that which is done.</P>
<P>THE next Morning the King called a Council, to con&s;ider whether they &s;hould that day compel the Enemy to Fight; which was concluded not to be rea&s;onable; and that it was better to expect the arrival of S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil;</HI> who was yet in the We&s;t of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and had a Body of eight thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, as was reported, though they were not near that number. It was hereupon order'd, that all the Foot &s;hould be pre&s;ently drawn into the Inclo&s;ures between <HI>Boconnocke</HI> and <MILESTONE N="20"> the Heath; all the Fences to the Grounds of that Country being very good Brea&s;t-works again&s;t the Enemy. The King's head Quarter was made at the Lord <HI>Mohun</HI>'s Hou&s;e, which the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had kindly quitted, when the King's Army advanced the day before. The Hor&s;e were Quarter'd, for the mo&s;t part, between <HI>Liskard</HI> and the Sea; and, every day, compell'd the Earl's Forces to retire, and to lodge clo&s;e to|gether; and in this po&s;ture both Armies lay within view of each other for three or four days. In this time, that inconvenient Spirit that had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed &s;o many of the Hor&s;e Officers, appear'd again; and &s;ome of them, who had conferr'd with the Pri&s;oners, who were every day taken, and &s;ome of them Officers of as good Quality as any they had, were per|&s;waded by them, <Q>&startq;that all the ob&s;tinacy in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> in refu&s;ing to treat with the King, proceeded only from his jealou&s;y that when the King had got him into his hands, he would take revenge upon him, for all the mi&s;chief he had &s;u&s;tain'd by him; and that, if he had any A&s;&s;urance that what was promi&s;ed would be complyed with, he would be quickly&endq; induced to treat.</Q></P>
<P>UPON this excellent Evidence, the&s;e Politick Contrivers pre&s;um'd to prepare a Letter, that &s;hould be &s;ub&s;cribed by the General, and al$ the Superior Officers of the Army; <Q>the beginning of which Letter was &startq;&endq; that they had obtain'd leave of the King to &s;end that Letter to him There they propo&s;ed,</Q> <Q>&startq;that He with &s;ix Officers, whom he &s;hould choo&s;e would the next Morning meet with their General, and &s;ix other Of+ficers, as &s;hould be appointed to attend him; and if he would not him+&s;elf be pre&s;ent, that then &s;ix Officers of the King's Army &s;hould mee with &s;ix &s;uch as He &s;hould appoint, at any place that &s;hould be though fit; and that they, and every of them, who &s;ub&s;cribed the Letter would, upon the honour and reputation of Gentlemen and Soldier with their lives maintain that what&s;oever his Maje&s;ty &s;hould promi&s;$ &s;hould be perform'd; and that it &s;hould not be in the power of a$ private Per&s;on what&s;oever, to interrupt or hinder the executi$$&endq; thereof.</Q> When they had framed this Letter between them&s;elves, a$ &s;hewed it to many others, who&s;e approbation they receiv'd, they re&s;olv$
<PB N="401" REF="4570">
to pre&s;ent it to the King, and humbly to de&s;ire his permi&s;&s;ion that it might be &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex.</HI></P>
<P>How unpardonable &s;oever the pre&s;umption and in&s;olence in con|triving and framing this Letter was, and how penal &s;oever it might ju&s;tly have been to them, yet, when it was pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, many who liked not the manner of it, were per&s;waded by what they were told, that it might do good; and in the end they prevailed with the King to con&s;ent that the Officers &s;hould &s;ign it; and that the Ge|neral &s;hould &s;end a Trumpet with it; his Maje&s;ty at the &s;ame time con|cluding, that it would find no better reception than his own Letter had done; and likewi&s;e believing, that the rejecting of it would purge that unruly &s;pirit out of his Army, and that he &s;hould never more be troubled with tho&s;e vexatious Addre&s;&s;es, and that it might add &s;ome Spirit and Animo&s;ity to the Officers and Soldiers, when they &s;hould &s;ee, with how much neglect and contempt the Earl receiv'd their applica|tion: And &s;o Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> General <HI>Goring,</HI> and all the Superior Of|ficers of the Army, &s;ign'd the Letter; which a Trumpet deliver'd to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> who, the next day, return'd his An&s;wer to them in the&s;e words: <Q>&startq;My Lords, in the beginning of your Letter you expre&s;s by what Authority you &s;end it; I having no Authority from the Par|liament, who have employed me, to treat, cannot give way to it with|out <MILESTONE N="$$"> breach of tru&s;t. My Lords, I am your humble Servant, <HI>E&s;&s;ex.&endq;</HI> <HI>Li&s;tithiel Aug.</HI> 10. 1644.</Q> This &s;hort &s;urly An&s;wer, produced the Effect the King wi&s;h'd and expected; they who had been &s;o over active in contriving the Addre&s;s, were mo&s;t a&s;hamed of their folly; and the whole Army &s;eem'd well compo&s;ed to obtain that by their Swords, which they could not by their Pen.</P>
<P>S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> was now come up to the Po&s;t where he &s;hould be; and, at <HI>Bodmin,</HI> in his March, had fallen upon a Party of the Earl's Hor&s;e, and killed many, and taken others Pri&s;oners, and pre&s;ented him|&s;elf <MILESTONE N="$0"> to the King at <HI>Boconnocke;</HI> giving his Maje&s;ty an account of his pro|ceedings, and a particular of his Forces; which, after all the high di&s;|cour&s;es, amounted really but to eighteen hundred Foot, and &s;ix hundred Hor&s;e; above one hundred of which were of the Queen's Troop (left behind when her Maje&s;ty embarked for <HI>France)</HI> under the Command of Captain <HI>Edward Bret;</HI> who had done very good Service in the We&s;tern parts of that County, from the time of the Queen's departure, and much confirm'd the Train'd-bands of tho&s;e parts. This Troop was pre&s;ently added to the King's Guards under the Lord <HI>Bernard Stuart,</HI> and Captain <HI>Bret</HI> was made Major of that Regiment.</P>
<P>THOUGH the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had but &s;treight and narrow room for his Quarters for &s;o great an Army of Hor&s;e and Foot, yet he had the good Town of <HI>Foy</HI> and the Sea to friend; by which he might rea&s;onably a&s;&s;ure him&s;elf of &s;tore of Provi&s;ions, the Parliament Ships having all the juri&s;diction there; and &s;o, if he pre&s;erv'd his Po&s;t, which was &s;o &s;ituated that he could not be compelled to Fight without giving him great Ad|vantage, he might well conclude, that <HI>Waller,</HI> or &s;ome other force &s;ent from the Parliament, would be &s;hortly upon the King's back, as his Maje&s;ty was upon His: and no que&s;tion, this rational confidence was a great motive to him to neglect all Overtures made to him by the King; be&s;ides the punctuality, and &s;tubborne&s;s of his own Nature; which who|&s;oever was well acquainted with, might ea&s;ily have fore&s;een, what ef|fect all tho&s;e Applications would have produced. It was therefore now
<PB N="402" REF="4580">
re&s;olv'd to make his Quarters yet &s;treighter, and to cut off even his Pro|vi&s;ions by Sea, or a good part thereof. To which purpo&s;e S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> drew his Men from <HI>Bodmin,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of <HI>Lanhe|therick,</HI> a &s;trong Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> two Miles We&s;t of <HI>Bocon|nocke,</HI> and over the River that runs to <HI>Li&s;tithiel,</HI> and thence to <HI>Foy,</HI> and likewi&s;e to <HI>Reprime-</HI>Bridge; by which the Enemy was not only de|prived of that u&s;eful out-let, but a &s;afe Communication made between him and the King's Army, which was before interrupted. And on the other &s;ide, which was of more importance, S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hley,</HI> with a good Party of Hor&s;e and Foot, made him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of <HI>View-</HI>Hall, another Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Mohun</HI>'s, over again&s;t <HI>Foy,</HI> and of <HI>Pernon-</HI>Fort, a <MILESTONE N="10"> mile below it, at the Mouth of the <HI>Haven;</HI> both which places he found &s;o tenable, that he put Captain <HI>Page</HI> into one, and Captain <HI>Garraway</HI> into the other, with two hundred Commanded Men, and two or three pieces of Ordnance; which the&s;e two Captains made good, and defended &s;o well, that they made <HI>Foy</HI> utterly u&s;ele&s;s to <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> &s;ave for the Quar|tering his Men; not &s;uffering any Provi&s;ions to be brought in to him from the Sea that way. And it was exceedingly wonder'd at by all Men, that he, being &s;o long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Foy,</HI> did not put &s;trong Guards into tho&s;e places; by which he might have prevented his Armies being brought into tho&s;e extreme nece&s;&s;ities they &s;hortly after fell into; which <MILESTONE N="20"> might ea&s;ily be fore&s;een, and as ea&s;ily, that way, have been prevented.</P>
<P>NOW the King had lei&s;ure to &s;it &s;till, and warily to expect what in|vention or &s;tratagem the Earl would make u&s;e of, to make &s;ome attempt upon his Army, or to make his own E&s;cape. In this po&s;ture both Ar|mies lay &s;till, without any notable Action, for the &s;pace of eight or ten days; when the King &s;eeing no better fruit from all that was hitherto done, re&s;olv'd to draw his whole Army together, and to make his own Quarters yet much nearer, and either to force <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to Fight, or to be unea&s;y even in his Quarters. And it was high time to do &s;o: for it was now certain, that either <HI>Waller</HI> him&s;elf, or &s;ome other Forces, were already upon their March towards the We&s;t. With this re&s;olution the whole Army advanced in &s;uch a manner, that the Enemy was compell'd &s;till to retire before them, and to quit their Quarters; and, among the re&s;t, a ri&s;ing ground called <HI>Beacon-</HI>Hill; which they no &s;ooner quitted, than the King po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed; and immediately cau&s;ed a &s;quare work to be there rai&s;ed, and a Battery made, upon which &s;ome pieces of Cannon were planted, that &s;hot into their Quarters, and did them great hurt; when Their Cannon, though they return'd twenty &s;hot for one, did very little or no harm.</P>
<P>AND now the King's Forces had a full pro&s;pect over all the others Quarters; &s;aw how all their Foot and Hor&s;e were di&s;po&s;ed, and from whence they receiv'd all their Forage and Provi&s;ions; which when clear|ly view'd and ob&s;erv'd, <HI>Goring</HI> was &s;ent with the greate&s;t part of the Hor&s;e, and fifteen hundred Foot, a little We&s;tward to S^t <HI>Bla&s;e,</HI> to drive the Enemy yet clo&s;er together, and to cut off the Provi&s;ions they re|ceiv'd from thence; which was &s;o well executed, that they did not only po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of S^t <HI>Austel,</HI> and the We&s;terly part of S^t <HI>Bla&s;e</HI> (&s;o that the Enemies Hor&s;e was reduced to that &s;mall extent of Earth that is between the River of <HI>Foy,</HI> and that at <HI>Bla&s;e,</HI> which is not above two Miles in breadth, and little more in length; in which they had for the mo&s;t part fed &s;ince they came to <HI>Li&s;tithiel,</HI> and therefore it could not now long &s;upply them) but likewi&s;e were Ma&s;ters of the <HI>Parr</HI> near
<PB N="403" REF="4590">
S^r <HI>Bla&s;e;</HI> whereby they deprived them of the chief place of Landing the Provi&s;ions which came by Sea. And now the Earl begun to be very &s;en&s;ible of the ill condition he was in, and di&s;cern'd that he &s;hould not be able long to remain in that po&s;ture; be&s;ides he had receiv'd adverti&s;e|ment that the Party which was &s;ent for his relief from <HI>London,</HI> had re|ceiv'd &s;ome bru&s;h in <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> which would much retard their March; and therefore it behoved him to enter upon new Coun&s;els, and to take new Re&s;olutions.</P>
<P>IT is very true the defeat at <HI>Cropredy</HI> (in which there did not ap|pear to be one thou&s;and Men kill'd, or taken Pri&s;oners) had &s;o totally broken <HI>Waller</HI>'s Army, that it could never be brought to Fight after; <MILESTONE N="10"> but when he had marched at a di&s;tance from the King, to recover the broken Spirits of his Men, and heard that his Maje&s;ty was marched di|rectly towards the We&s;t, ob&s;erving likewi&s;e that every Night very ma|ny of his Men run from him, he thought it nece&s;&s;ary to go him&s;elf to <HI>London,</HI> where he made grievous complaints again&s;t the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> as if he had purpo&s;ely expo&s;ed him to be affronted; all which was greedi|ly hearken'd to, and his Per&s;on receiv'd, and treated, as if he had re|turn'd victorious after having defeated the King's Ar$$: which was a Method very contrary to what was u&s;ed in the King's Quarters, where <MILESTONE N="20"> all accidental Misfortunes, how inevitable &s;oever, were &s;till attended with very apparent di&s;countenance.</P>
<P>BUT when he went him&s;elf to <HI>London,</HI> or pre&s;ently upon it, he &s;ent his Lieutenant General <HI>Middleton</HI> (a Per&s;on of whom We &s;hall &s;ay much hereafter, and who liv'd to wipe out the Memory of the ill foot|&s;teps of his youth; for he was but eighteen years of Age, when he was fir&s;t led into Rebellion) with a Body of three thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Dra|goons, to follow the King into the We&s;t, and to wait upon his Rear, with orders to reduce in his way <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle, the Hou&s;e of a pri|vate Gentleman near <HI>Newbury,</HI> in which there were a Company or two <MILESTONE N="30"> of Foot of the Kings; and which they believ'd would be deliver'd up, a&s;&s;oon as demanded; being a place, as They thought, of little &s;trength. But <HI>Middleton</HI> found it &s;o well defended by Colonel <HI>Bois,</HI> who was Go|vernour of it, that after he had lo&s;t at lea&s;t three hundred Officers and Soldiers, in attempting to take it, he was compell'd to recommend it to the Governour of <HI>Abingdon,</HI> to &s;end an Officer and &s;ome Troops to block it up from infe&s;ting that great road into the We&s;t; and him&s;elf pro&s;ecuted his March to follow the King.</P>
<P>IN <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> he heard of great Magazines of all Provi&s;ions, made for the Supply of the King's Army, which were &s;ent every day by &s;trong <MILESTONE N="$0"> Convoys to <HI>Exeter,</HI> there to wait farther Orders. To &s;urpri&s;e the&s;e Provi&s;ions he &s;ent Major <HI>Carr,</HI> with five hundred Hor&s;e; who fell into the Village where the Convoy was, and was very like to have ma&s;ter'd them, when S^r <HI>Francis Doddington,</HI> with a Troop of Hor&s;e, and &s;ome Foot from <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> came &s;ea&s;onably to their relief; and after a very &s;harp conflict, in which two or three good Officers of the King's were killed, and, among them, Major <HI>Killigrew,</HI> a very hopeful young Man, the Son of a gallant and mo&s;t de&s;erving Father, he totally routed the Enemy; killed thirty or forty upon the place; and had the pur&s;uit of them two or three Miles; in which Major <HI>Carr,</HI> who commanded the Party, and many other Officers, were taken; and many others de|&s;perately wounded; and recover'd all that they had taken: which &s;harp Encounters, where allways many more Men are lo&s;t, than are kill'd, or
<PB N="404" REF="4600">
taken Pri&s;oners, put &s;uch a &s;top to <HI>Middleton</HI>'s march, that he was glad to retire back to <HI>Sherborne,</HI> that he might refre&s;h the wearine&s;s, and recover the Spirits of his Men. This was the defeat or ob&s;truction, which the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had Intelligence that the Forces had met with coming to his relief; and which made him de&s;pair of any Succour that way.</P>
<P>WHEN the Earl found him&s;elf in this condition, and that, within very few days, he mu&s;t be without any Provi&s;ions for his Army; he re&s;olv'd, that S^r <HI>William Balfour</HI> &s;hould u&s;e his utmo&s;t endeavour to break through with his whole Body of Hor&s;e, and to &s;ave them the be&s;t he could; and then that he him&s;elf would embark his Foot at <HI>Foy,</HI> and <MILESTONE N="10"> with them e&s;cape by Sea. And two Foot Soldiers of the Army, whereof one was a <HI>French-</HI>man, came over from them, and a&s;&s;ured the King, <Q>&startq;that they intended, that Night, to break through with their Hor&s;e, which were all then drawn on that &s;ide the River, and Town of <HI>Li&s;ti|thiel;</HI> and that the Foot were to march to <HI>Foy,</HI> where they &s;hould be&endq; embarked.</Q> This Intelligence agreed with what they otherwi&s;e receiv'd, and was believ'd as it ought to be; <Q>and thereupon, order was given, &startq;&endq; that both Armies (for that under Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> was looked upon as di&s;tinct,</Q> <Q>and allways &s;o Quarter'd) &startq;&s;hould &s;tand to their Armes all that Night; and if the Hor&s;e attempted an e&s;cape, fall on them from both&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> Quarters;</Q> the pa&s;&s;age between them, through which they mu&s;t go, being but a Mu&s;quet &s;hot over; and they could not avoid going very near a very little Cottage, that was well Fortified; in which fifty Mu&s;|queteers were placed. Adverti&s;ement was &s;ent to <HI>Goring,</HI> and all the Hor&s;e; and the Orders renew'd, which had formerly been given, for the breaking down the Bridges, and cutting down the Trees near the high way, to ob&s;truct their pa&s;&s;age.</P>
<P>THE Effect of all this providence was not &s;uch as was rea&s;onably to <NOTE PLACE="marg">Balfour <HI>with the Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex<HI>'s Hor&s;e e&s;capes thro' the King's Ar|my.</HI></NOTE> be expected. The Night grew dark and mi&s;ty, as the Enemy could <MILESTONE N="3$"> wi&s;h; and about three in the Morning, the whole Body of the Hor&s;e pa&s;&s;ed with great Silence between the Armies, and within Pi&s;tol &s;hot of the Cottage, without &s;o much as one Mu&s;quet di&s;charged at them. At the break of day, the Hor&s;e were di&s;cover'd marching over the Heath, beyond the reach of the Foot; and there was only at hand the Earl of <HI>Cleveland</HI>'s Brigade, the Body of the King's Hor&s;e being at a greater di&s;tance. That Brigade, to which &s;ome other Troops which had taken the Alarm joyn'd, follow'd them in the Rear; and killed &s;ome, and took more Pri&s;oners: but &s;tronger Parties of the Enemy frequently turning upon them, and the whole Body often making a &s;tand, they were often compelled to retire; yet follow'd in that manner, that they killed and took about a hundred; which was the greate&s;t damage they &s;u&s;tain'd in their whole March. The Notice and Orders came to <HI>Goring,</HI> when he was in one of his jovial Exerci&s;es; which he receiv'd with mirth, and &s;lighting tho&s;e who &s;ent them, as Men who took Alarms too warmly; and he continued his delights, till all the Enemies Hor&s;e were pa&s;&s;ed through his Quarters; nor did then pur&s;ue them in any time. So that, excepting &s;uch who, by the tiring of their Hor&s;es, became Pri&s;oners <HI>Balfour</HI> continued his March even to <HI>London,</HI> with le&s;s lo&s;s or trouble than can be imagined, to the infinite reproach of the King's Army, an$ of all his Garri&s;ons in the way. Nor was any Man called in que&s;tion fo$ this &s;upine neglect; it being not thought fit to make &s;evere inqui&s;itio$ into the behaviour of the re&s;t, when it was &s;o notoriou&s;ly known, how th$ Superior Officer had failed in his duty.</P>
<P><PB N="405" REF="4610">
THE next Morning, after the Hor&s;e were gone, the Earl drew all his Foot together, and quitted <HI>Li&s;tithiel,</HI> and marched towards <HI>Foy;</HI> having left order for the breaking down that Bridge. But his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf from his new Fort di&s;cern'd it, and &s;ent a Company of Mu&s;|queteers, who quickly beat tho&s;e that were left; and thereby pre&s;erv'd the Bridge; over which the King pre&s;ently marched to overtake the Rear of the Army, which marched &s;o fa&s;t, yet in good Order, that they left two Demy-Culverins, and two other very good Guns, and &s;ome Ammunition, to be di&s;po&s;ed of by the King. That day was &s;pent in &s;mart Skirmi&s;hes, in which many fell; and if the King's Hor&s;e had been more, whereof he had only two Troops of his Guards (which did good Service) it would have proved a bloody day to the Enemy. The night coming on, the King lay in the Field, his own Quarters being &s;o near the Enemy, that they di&s;charged many Cannot &s;hot, which fell within few yards of him, when he was at Supper. <HI>Sunday</HI> being the next day, and the fir&s;t day of <HI>September,</HI> in the morning, <HI>Butler,</HI> Lieutenant Co|lonel to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who had been taken Pri&s;oner at <HI>Boconnocke,</HI> and was exchanged for an Officer of the Kings, came from the Earl to de&s;ire a Parley. A&s;&s;oon as he was &s;ent away, the Earl embarked him|&s;elf, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>leaves his Army, and e&s;capes to</HI> Ply|mouth <HI>by Sea.</HI></NOTE> with the Lord <HI>Roberts,</HI> and &s;uch other Officers as he had mo&s;t kindne&s;s for, in a Ve&s;&s;el at <HI>Foy;</HI> and &s;o e&s;caped into <HI>Plymouth;</HI> leaving all his Army of Foot, Cannon, and Ammunition, to the care of Major General <HI>Skippon;</HI> who was to make as good conditions for them as he could; and after a very &s;hort &s;tay in <HI>Plymouth,</HI> he went on board a Ship of the Royal Navy, that attended there; and was, within few days, de|liver'd at <HI>London;</HI> where he was receiv'd without any abatement of the re&s;pect they had con&s;tantly paid him; nor was it le&s;s than they could have &s;hew'd to him, if he had not only brought back his own Army, but the King him&s;elf likewi&s;e with him.</P>
<P>THE King con&s;ented to the Parley; upon which a Ce&s;&s;ation was <NOTE PLACE="marg">Skippon <HI>makes Condi|tions for the Foot.</HI></NOTE> concluded; and Ho&s;tages interchangeably deliver'd; and then the Ene|my &s;ent Propo&s;itions, &s;uch as upon delivery of a &s;trong fortified Town, after a hand&s;ome defence, are u&s;ually granted. But they quickly found they were not looked upon as Men in that condition; and &s;o, in the end, they were contented to deliver up all their Cannon; which, with the Four taken two or three days before, were eight and thirty pieces of Cannon; a hundred Barrels of Powder, with Match and Bullets pro|portionable; and about &s;ix thou&s;and Armes; which being done, <Q>&startq;the Officers were to have liberty to wear their Swords, and to Pa&s;s with their own Money, and proper Goods; and to &s;ecure them from plun|der, they were to have a Convoy to <HI>Poole,</HI> or <HI>Southampton;</HI> all their &s;ick and wounded might &s;tay in <HI>Foy</HI> till they were recover'd, and then&endq; have Pa&s;&s;es to <HI>Plymouth.</HI></Q></P>
<P>THIS Agreement was executed accordingly, on <HI>Monday</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>September,</HI> and though it was near the evening before all was fini&s;hed, they would march away that night; and though all care was taken to pre&s;erve them from violence, yet fir&s;t at <HI>Li&s;tithiel,</HI> where they had been $ong Quarter'd, and in other Towns through which they had formerly $a&s;&s;ed, the Inhabitants, e&s;pecially the Women, who pretended to &s;ee their own Cloaths and Goods about them, which they had been plunder'd $f, treated them very rudely, even to &s;tripping of &s;ome of the Soldiers, $nd more of their Wives, who had before behaved them&s;elves with great In&s;olence in the march. That night there came about one hundred

<P>WHILST the King was in the We&s;t, though he had left <HI>Oxford</HI> in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Affairs at</HI> Oxford <HI>during the King's ab|&s;ence.</HI></NOTE> a very ill State in re&s;pect of Provi&s;ions and Fortifications, and Soldiers, and of the different humours of tho&s;e who remain'd there, the Town being full of Lords (be&s;ides tho&s;e of the Council) and of Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Quality, with very many Ladies, who, when not plea&s;ed them&s;elves, <MILESTONE N="1$"> kept others from being &s;o; yet, in his ab&s;ence, they who were &s;ollicitous to carry on his Service, concurr'd and agreed &s;o well together, that they prevailed with the re&s;t to do every thing that was nece&s;&s;ary. They cau&s;ed Provi&s;ions of Corn to be laid in, in great proportions; a&s;&s;igning the publick Schools to that purpo&s;e; and committing the Cu&s;tody of them to the owners of the Corn. They had rai&s;ed &s;o many Voluntiers, that their Guards were well kept, and there was need they &s;hould be &s;o; for when both the Parliament Armies were before the Town, Major General <HI>Brown,</HI> a Citizen of <HI>London</HI> of good reputation, and a &s;tout Man, had been left in <HI>Abingdon</HI> with a &s;trong Garri&s;on; from whence, <MILESTONE N="$$"> being &s;uperior in number, he infe&s;ted <HI>Oxford</HI> very much; which gave them the more rea&s;on to pro&s;ecute the Fortifications; which, in the mo&s;t important places, they brought to a good perfection; and when they had no more apprehen&s;ion of a Siege, <HI>Waller</HI> being at a di&s;tance, and not able to follow the King, and le&s;s able to &s;it down before <HI>Oxford,</HI> they re&s;olv'd to do &s;omewhat to be talked of.</P>
<P>THE King had, before his departure, found they were not &s;atisfied with their Governour, and very apprehen&s;ive of his rudene&s;s, and want of Complacency. Upon the death of S^r <HI>William Penniman,</HI> who had been Governour of <HI>Oxford,</HI> to the great &s;atisfaction of all Men, being a very brave and generous Per&s;on, and who perform'd all manner of Civilities to all &s;orts of People, as having had a good Education, and well under&s;tanding the manners of the Court (the Queen being then in <HI>Oxford)</HI> her Maje&s;ty, who thought her &s;elf the &s;afer for being under the charge, and care of a Roman Catholick, prevailed with the King, to confer that charge upon S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton;</HI> who had been at <HI>Reading,</HI> and had the fortune to be very much e&s;teem'd, where he was Not known; and very much di&s;liked, where he was; and he was by this time too well known at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to be belov'd by any; which the King well un|der&s;tood, and was the more troubled, becau&s;e he &s;aw the prejudice was univer&s;al, and with too much rea&s;on; and therefore his Maje&s;ty had given an extraordinary Commi&s;&s;ion to the Lords of his Council, to who&s;e Authority he was to &s;ubmit, which obliged him to live with a little more re&s;pect towards them, than he de&s;ired to do; being a Man of a rough Nature, and &s;o given up to an immoderate love of Money that he cared not by what unrighteous ways he exacted it. There were likewi&s;e &s;ome Officers of Name, who, having then no charge in the Army, &s;tayed in the Town; and tho&s;e, by the King's direction, the Lord di&s;po&s;ed to a&s;&s;i&s;t the Governour; and particularly, to take care of the &s;everal Quarters of the Town; one whereof was a&s;&s;ign'd to each o$ them: among them, Colonel <HI>Gage</HI> was one; who having the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Regiment in <HI>Flanders,</HI> had got leave there to make offer of his Servic$ to the King; and to that purpo&s;e was newly come from thence to <HI>Oxford</HI></P>

HE was in truth a very extraordinary Man, of a large and very grace|ful Per&s;on, of an Honourable extraction, his Grandfather having been Knight of the Garter; be&s;ides his great experience and abilities as a Sol|dier, which were very eminent, he had very great parts of breeding, being a very good Scholar in the polite parts of Learning, a great Ma|&s;ter in the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> and <HI>Italian</HI> Tongues, be&s;ides the <HI>French</HI> and the <HI>Dutch,</HI> which he &s;poke in great perfection; having &s;carce been in <HI>Eng|land</HI> in twenty years before.

Of this Gentleman, the Lords of the Council had a &s;ingular e&s;teem, and con&s;ulted frequently with him, whil&s;t they look'd to be Be&s;ieged; and thought <HI>Oxford</HI> to be the more &s;ecure for His being in it; which render'd him &s;o ungrateful to the Governour, S^r <HI>Arthur,</HI> that he cro&s;&s;ed him in any thing he propo&s;ed, and hated him perfectly; as they were of Natures, and Manners, $Word$ different as Men can be.</P>
<P>THE Garri&s;on of <HI>Ba&s;ing-</HI>Hou&s;e, the Seat of the Marquis of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Colonel</HI> Gage <HI>relieves</HI> Ba&s;ing <HI>Hou&s;e.</HI></NOTE> in which him&s;elf was and commanded, had been now &s;treightly Be|&s;ieged, <MILESTONE N="20"> for the &s;pace of above three Months, by a conjunction of the Parliament Troops of <HI>Ham&s;hire</HI> and <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> under the Command of <HI>Norton, On&s;low, Jarvis, Whitehead,</HI> and <HI>Morley,</HI> all Colonels of Regi|ments, and now united in this Service under the Command of <HI>Norton;</HI> a Man of Spirit, and of the greate&s;t Fortune of all the re&s;t. It was &s;o clo&s;ely begirt before the King's March into the We&s;t, and was looked upon as a place of &s;uch importance, that when the King &s;ent Notice to <HI>Oxford</HI> of his re&s;olution to march into the We&s;t, the Council hum|bly de&s;ired his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;that he would make <HI>Ba&s;ing</HI> his way, and there|by&endq; relieve it,</Q> which his Maje&s;ty found would have retarded his march too much, and might have invited <HI>Waller</HI> the &s;ooner to follow him; <MILESTONE N="$0"> and therefore declined it. From that time, the Marquis, by frequent expre&s;&s;es, <Q>importuned the Lords of the Council &startq;to provide, in &s;ome manner, for his relief; and not to &s;uffer his Per&s;on, and a place from&endq; whence the Rebels receiv'd &s;o much prejudice,</Q> to fall into their hands. The Lady <HI>Marchione&s;s,</HI> his wife, was then in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and &s;ollicited very diligently the timely pre&s;ervation of her Husband; which made every body de&s;ire to gratify her, being a Lady of great Honour and Al|liance, as Si&s;ter to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and to the Lady <HI>Marchione&s;s</HI> of <HI>Hertford;</HI> who was likewi&s;e in the Town, and engaged her Husband to take this bu&s;ine&s;s to heart: and all the Roman Catholicks, who were numerous in the Town, look'd upon them&s;elves as concern'd to contri|bute all they could to the good work, and &s;o offer'd to li&s;t them&s;elves, and their Servants in the Service.</P>
<P>THE Council, both upon publick and private motives, was very heartily di&s;po&s;ed to effect it; and had &s;everal conferences together, and with the Officers; in all which the Governour too rea&s;onably oppo&s;ed the de&s;ign, <Q>&startq;as full of more difficulties, and liable to greater damages, than any Soldier who under&s;tood Command, would expo&s;e him&s;elf&endq; and the King's Service to;</Q> <Q>and prote&s;ted, &startq;that he would not &s;uffer any of the &s;mall Garri&s;on that was under his charge, to be hazarded&endq; in the attempt.</Q> It was very true, <HI>Ba&s;ing</HI> was near forty Miles from <HI>Oxford,</HI> and, in the way between them, the Enemy had a &s;trong Garri&s;on

of Hor&s;e and Foot at <HI>Abingdon,</HI> and as &s;trong at <HI>Reading,</HI> who&s;e Hor&s;e every day vi&s;ited all the high ways near, be&s;ides a Body of Hor&s;e and Dragoons Quarter'd at <HI>Newbury;</HI> &s;o that it appear'd to mo&s;t Men hard|ly po&s;&s;ible to &s;end a Party to <HI>Ba&s;ing,</HI> and impo&s;&s;ible for that Party to return to <HI>Oxford,</HI> if they &s;hould be able to get to <HI>Ba&s;ing:</HI> yet new im|portunities from the Marquis, with a po&s;itive Declaration, <Q>&startq;that he could not defend it above ten days, and mu&s;t then &s;ubmit to the wor&s;t conditions the Rebels were like to grant to his Per&s;on, and to his Re|ligion;&endq;</Q> and new in&s;tances from his Lady, prevailed with the Lords to enter upon a new con&s;ultation; in which the Governour per&s;i&s;ted in his old re&s;olution, as &s;eeing no cau&s;e to change it. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P><Q>IN this Debate Colonel <HI>Gage</HI> declared, &startq;that though he thought the Service full of hazard, e&s;pecially for the return; yet if the Lords would, by li&s;ting their own Servants, per&s;wade the Gentlemen in the Town to do the like, and engage their own Per&s;ons, whereby a good Troop or two of Hor&s;e might be rai&s;ed (upon which the principal dependence mu&s;t be) he would willingly, if there were no body el&s;e thought fitter for it, undertake the conduct of them him&s;elf; and hoped he &s;hould&endq; give a good account of it:</Q> which being offer'd with great chearfulne&s;s by a Per&s;on, of who&s;e Prudence, as well as Courage, they had a full con|fidence, they all re&s;olv'd to do the utmo&s;t that was in their power to <MILESTONE N="20"> make it effectual.</P>
<P>THERE was about this time, by the &s;urrender of <HI>Greenland-</HI>Hou&s;e (which could not po&s;&s;ibly be longer defended, the whole &s;tructure being beaten down by the Cannon) the Regiment of Colonel <HI>Hawkins</HI> march'd into <HI>Oxford,</HI> amounting to near three Hundred; to which as many others joyn'd as made it up four hundred Men. The Lords mounted their Servants upon their own Hor&s;es; and they, with the Voluntiers, who frankly li&s;ted them&s;elves, amounted to a Body of two hundred and fifty very good Hor&s;e, all put under the Command of Colonel <HI>William</HI> <MILESTONE N="$$"> <HI>Web,</HI> an excellent Officer, bred up in <HI>Flanders</HI> in &s;ome emulation with Colonel <HI>Gage;</HI> and who, upon the Catholick Intere&s;t, was at this time contented to &s;erve under him. With this &s;mall Party for &s;o great an Action, <HI>Gage</HI> marched out of <HI>Oxford</HI> in the beginning of the Night; and, by the Morning, reached the place where he intended to refre&s;h him&s;elf and his Troops; which was a Wood near <HI>Wallingford;</HI> from whence he di&s;patched an Expre&s;s to S^r <HI>William Ogle,</HI> Governour of <HI>Win|che&s;ter;</HI> who had made a promi&s;e to the Lords of the Council, <Q>&startq;that, when&s;oever they would endeavour the rai&s;ing of the Siege before <HI>Ba&s;ing,</HI> he would &s;end one hundred Hor&s;e, and three hundred Foot&endq; out of his Garri&s;on for their A&s;&s;i&s;tance;</Q> and a pre&s;umption upon this aid, was the principal motive for the undertaking: and &s;o he was di|rected, at What hour in the Morning his Party &s;hould fall into <HI>Ba&s;ing</HI> Park, in the Rear of the Rebel's Quarters; whil&s;t <HI>Gage</HI> him&s;elf would fall on the other &s;ide; the Marquis being de&s;ired at the &s;ame time to make frequent Sallies from the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P>AFTER &s;ome hours of refre&s;hment in the Morning, and &s;ending this expre&s;s to <HI>Winchester,</HI> the Troops marched through by Lanes to <HI>Al|derma&s;ton,</HI> a Village out of any great rode; where they intended to take more re&s;t that Night. They had marched, from the time they left <HI>Oxford,</HI> with Orange-Tawny Scarfs and Ribbans, that they might be taken for the Parliament Soldiers; and hoped, by that Artifice, to have pa&s;&s;ed undi&s;cover'd even to the approach upon the Be&s;iegers. But the
<PB N="409" REF="4660">
Party of Hor&s;e which was &s;ent before to <HI>Alderma&s;ton,</HI> found there &s;ome of the Parliament Hor&s;e, and forgetting their Orange-Tawny Scarfs, fell upon them; and killed &s;ome, and took &s;ix or &s;even Pri&s;oners; whereby the &s;ecret was di&s;cover'd, and notice quickly &s;ent to <HI>Ba&s;ing</HI> of the approaching danger; which accident made their &s;tay &s;horter at that Village than was intended, and than the wearine&s;s of the Soldiers re|quired. About eleven of the Clock, they begun their march again; which they continued all that Night; the Hor&s;emen often alighting, that the Foot might ride, and others taking many of them behind them; however they could not but be extremely weary, and &s;urbated.</P>
<P>BETWEEN four and five of the Clock on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> Morning, it <MILESTONE N="10"> having been <HI>Monday</HI> Night that they left <HI>Oxford,</HI> they arriv'd within a mile of <HI>Ba&s;ing;</HI> where an Officer, &s;ent from S^r <HI>William Ogle,</HI> came to them to let them know, <Q>&startq;that he dur&s;t not &s;end his Troops &s;o far, in&endq; regard many of the Enemies Hor&s;e lay between <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> and <HI>Ba&s;ing.</HI></Q> This broke all the Colonels mea&s;ures; and, &s;ince there was no receding, made him change the whole method of his proceedings; and in&s;tead of dividing his Forces, and falling on in &s;everal places, as he meant to have done if the <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> Forces had complied with their obligation, or if his march had been undi&s;cover'd, he re&s;olv'd now to fall on joynt|ly <MILESTONE N="20"> with all his Body in one place; in order to which, he commanded the Men to be ranged in Battalions; and rid to every Squadron, giving them &s;uch words as were proper to the occa&s;ion; which no Man could more pertinently deliver, or with a better grace: he commanded every Man to tye a white tape Ribban, or Handkerchief above the Elbow of their right Arme; and gave them the word <HI>S^t George;</HI> which was the &s;ign and the <HI>word</HI> that he had &s;ent before to the Marquis, le&s;t in his Sallies their Men, for want of di&s;tinction, might fall foul of each other.</P>
<P>THUS they marched towards the Hou&s;e, Colonel <HI>Web</HI> leading the right Wing, and Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Bunkly</HI> the le&s;t of the Hor&s;e; and <MILESTONE N="$0"> <HI>Gage</HI> him&s;elf the Foot: they had not marched far, when at the upper end of a large Campagne Field, upon a little ri&s;ing of an Hill, they di&s;cern'd a Body of five Cornets of Hor&s;e very full, &s;tanding in very good order to receive them. But before any impre&s;&s;ion could be made upon them, the Colonel mu&s;t pa&s;s between two Hedges lined very thick with Mu&s;queteers; from whom the Hor&s;e very couragiou&s;ly bore a &s;mart Volly, and then Charged the Enemies Hor&s;e &s;o gallantly, that, after a &s;horter re&s;i&s;tance than was expected from the known Courage of <HI>Norton,</HI> though many of his Men fell, they gave ground; and at la&s;t plainly run to a &s;afe place, beyond which they could not be pur&s;ued. The Foot di&s;puted the bu&s;ine&s;s much better, and being beaten from hedge to hedge, retired into their Quarters and Works; which they did not abandon in le&s;s than two hours; and then a free entrance into the Hou&s;e was gained on that &s;ide, where the Colonel only &s;tayed to &s;alute the Marquis, and to put in the Ammunition he had brought with him; which was only twelve Barrels of Powder, and twelve hundred weight of Match; and immediately marched with his Hor&s;e and Foot to <HI>Ba&s;ing|&s;toke,</HI> a good Market Town two Miles from the Hou&s;e: leaving one hundred Foot to be led, by &s;ome Officers of the Garri&s;on, to the Town of <HI>Ba&s;ing,</HI> a Village but a Mile di&s;tant. In <HI>Ba&s;ing-stoke,</HI> they found &s;tore of Wheat, Mault, Oats, Salt, Bacon, Chee&s;e and Butter; as much of which, was all that day &s;ent to the Hou&s;e, as they could find Carts or Hor&s;es to tran&s;port, together with fourteen Barrels of Powder, and

&s;ome Mu&s;quets, and forty or fifty head of Cattle, with above one hun|dred Sheep: whil&s;t the other Party, that went to <HI>Ba&s;ing</HI> Town, beat the Enemy that was Quarter'd there, after having kill'd forty or fifty of them; &s;ome fled into the Church, where they were quickly taken Pri|&s;oners; and, among them, two Captains, <HI>Jarvi&s;e</HI> and <HI>Jeph&s;on,</HI> the two elde&s;t Sons of two of the greate&s;t Rebels of that Country, and both Heirs to good Fortunes, who were carried Pri&s;oners to <HI>Ba&s;ing-</HI>Hou&s;e; the re&s;t, who Be&s;ieged that &s;ide, being fled into a &s;trong Fort which they had rai&s;ed in the Park. The Colonel &s;pent that, and the next day, in &s;ending all manner of Provi&s;ions into the Hou&s;e; and then rea&s;onably computing that the Garri&s;on was well provided for two Months, he thought of his retreat to <HI>Oxford;</HI> which it was time to do: for be&s;ides that <HI>Norton</HI> had drawn all his Men together, who had been di&s;mayed, with all the Troops which lay Quarter'd within any di&s;tance, and ap|pear'd within &s;ight of the Hou&s;e more numerous and gay than before, as if he meant to be revenged before they parted, he was likewi&s;e well inform'd by the Per&s;ons he had imployed, that the Enemy from <HI>Abing|don</HI> had lodged them&s;elves at <HI>Alderma&s;ton,</HI> and tho&s;e from <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Newbury,</HI> in two other Villages upon the River <HI>Kennet;</HI> over which he was to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>HEREUPON, that he might take away the Apprehen&s;ion that he meant &s;uddainly to depart, he &s;ent out Orders, which he was &s;ure would come into the Enemies hands, to two or three Villages next the Hou&s;e, <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould, by the next day-noon, &s;end &s;uch proportions of Corn into <HI>Ba&s;ing-</HI>Hou&s;e, as were mention'd in the Warrants; upon pain, if they failed by the time, to have a thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Dragoons &s;ent&endq; to fire the Towns.</Q> This being done, and all his Men drawn together about eleven of the Clock at Night, <HI>Thur&s;day</HI> the &s;econd Night after he came thither, the Marquis giving him two or three Guides who knew the Country exactly, he marched from <HI>Ba&s;ing</HI> without &s;ound of Drum or Trumpet, and pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Kennet,</HI> undi&s;cover'd, by a Ford near a Bridge which the Enemy had broke down; and thereby thought they had &s;ecured that pa&s;&s;age; the Hor&s;e taking the Foot <HI>en Croup;</HI> and then, marching by-ways, in the Morning they likewi&s;e pa&s;&s;ed over the <HI>Thames,</HI> at a Ford little more than a Mile from <HI>Reading;</HI> and &s;o e&s;caped the Enemy, and got before Night to <HI>Wallingford;</HI> where he &s;ecurely re&s;ted, and refre&s;hed his Men that Night; and the next Day arrived &s;afe at <HI>Oxford;</HI> having lo&s;t only two Captains, and two or three other Gentlemen, and Common Men; in all to the number of eleven; and forty or fifty wounded, but not dangerou&s;ly: what number the Enemy lo&s;t could not be known; but it was believ'd, they lo&s;t many, be&s;ides above one hundred Pri&s;oners that were taken; and it was confe&s;s'd, by Enemies as well as Friends, that it was as Soldierly an Action, as had been perform'd in the War on either &s;ide; and redounded very much to the reputation of the Commander.</P>
<P>THE next day after the Army of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was gone, and di&s;&s;olv'd, the King return'd to his Quarters at <HI>Boconnocke,</HI> and &s;tayed there only&punc; day to refre&s;h his Men; having &s;ent, the day before, <HI>Greenvil,</HI> with the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Hor&s;e and Foot, towards <HI>Plymouth,</HI> to joyn with <HI>Goring</HI> i$ the pur&s;uit of <HI>Balfour,</HI> and that Body of Hor&s;e; which, by pa&s;&s;ing ove$ the Bridge near <HI>Salt-a&s;h,</HI> they might ea&s;ily have done.

Wainman,</HI> a young Man of extraordinary parts and ex|pectation, the Son of a very wi&s;e and eminent Father, was lo&s;t, to the irreparable damage of a Noble Family. Thus <HI>Balfour,</HI> by an orderly and well govern'd march, pa&s;s'd above one hundred Miles in the King's Quarters, as hath been &s;aid before, without any con&s;iderable lo&s;s, to a <MILESTONE N="10"> place of &s;afety within their own precincts.</P>
<P>THE fear and apprehen&s;ion of the Enemy was no &s;ooner over, than the murmur begun, <Q>&startq;that the King had been per&s;waded to grant too good conditions to that Body of Foot; and that he might well have forced them to have &s;ubmitted to his mercy, as well as to have laid down their Armes; and &s;o have made both Officers and Soldiers to become Pri&s;oners of War: by which the Enemy would not have been&endq; able &s;o &s;oon to have rai&s;ed another Army.</Q> But they who undertook to cen&s;ure that Action, how great a Number &s;oever they were, did not at all under&s;tand the pre&s;ent temper and con&s;titution of the King's Ar|my; <MILESTONE N="$0"> which then was not near &s;o &s;trong as it was reputed to be: what|ever it might have done by a brisk and vigorous attempt, when it fir&s;t enter'd <HI>Cornwal,</HI> which was in the beginning of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> and when a Party of his Maje&s;ties Hor&s;e &s;urpri&s;ed and &s;ei&s;ed the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s own Lieutenant Colonel, and many other Officers of Name at <HI>Boconnocke,</HI> before his Maje&s;ty was &s;u&s;pected to be in any near di&s;tance: I &s;ay what|ever might have been then done, in that con&s;ternation the Enemy was then in, the ca&s;e was very much alter'd in the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> when the Articles were made; and when the number of the Foot who laid down their Armes, was in truth &s;uperior to tho&s;e of the King's (as <MILESTONE N="$0"> it will appear anon) when his Army marched out of <HI>Cornwal.</HI> The over&s;ight, which was a great one, was on the other &s;ide, when their Hor&s;e broke through. If they had then known, and it was hardly po&s;&s;i|ble they &s;hould not know it, that all the King's Hor&s;e, his Guard only excepted, were at that time Quarter'd behind them, about S^t <HI>Bla&s;e,</HI> their Foot might very well have marched away with their Hor&s;e, their Can|non only being left behind, and having got but four or five hours be|fore, which they might ea&s;ily, and as undi&s;cern'd have done, the King's Army in the condition and &s;tate it was in, naked and un&s;hod, would through tho&s;e inclo&s;ed parts, narrow Lanes, and deep Ditches, in <HI>Devon</HI> <MILESTONE N="$0"> and <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> have been able to have done them little harm: Be&s;ides the King very well knew at the time the Articles were made, that <HI>Mid|dleton,</HI> notwith&s;tanding all his Affronts, was then come to <HI>Tiverton;</HI> and therefore there can be no doubt, that his Maje&s;ty, in tho&s;e con|de&s;cen&s;ions, proceeded with no le&s;s Prudence than Clemency.</P>
<P>AFTER this great Succe&s;s, the King thought fit to renew his offer <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;ends a Me&s;&s;age of Peace.</NOTE> of Peace; and &s;ent a Me&s;&s;age to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament, to de|&s;ire that there might be a Treaty to that purpo&s;e; which Me&s;&s;age was &s;ent by a Trumpet to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> after his repair to <HI>London,</HI> to be deliver'd by him, of which there was no con&s;ideration taken in three Months after the receipt of it. This done, the King was per&s;waded, in his way (as it was not much out of it) to look upon <HI>Plymouth;</HI> for &s;o far it might be pre&s;umed that the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Troops, how impatient &s;oever
<PB N="412" REF="4690">
they were to be at their harve&s;t, would attend him: And if he could, by appearing before it, become Ma&s;ter of it, which was not thought improbable, he might return to <HI>Oxford</HI> in great Triumph, and leave the We&s;t throughly reduced: for then <HI>Lyme</HI> could not hold out, and he might be &s;ure to carry an Army with him &s;trongly recruited; but if it proved not a work of ea&s;e and expedition, he might proceed in his march without farther &s;tay; and he quickly found it nece&s;&s;ary to do &s;o; having &s;ent a Summons to the Town, and receiv'd a rude An&s;wer to it:</P>
<P>FOR the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> had left the Lord <HI>Roberts</HI> Governour in that Town; a Man of a &s;our and &s;urly nature, a great Opini&acirc;tre, and one who mu&s;t be overcome before he would believe that he could be &s;o. <MILESTONE N="1$"> The King, finding no good could be done with him, and that the re|ducing the Town would require &s;ome time, pur&s;ued his former re&s;olu|tion, and marched away; having committed the Blocking up of <HI>Ply|mouth</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King leaves S^r</HI> Ri|chard Green|vil <HI>to Block up</HI> Plymouth.</NOTE> to S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> a Man who had been bred a Soldier, and of great expectation, but of greater promi&s;es; having with all manner of A&s;&s;urance undertaken to take the Town by <HI>Chri&s;tmas,</HI> if &s;uch con|ditions might be perform'd to him, all which were punctually complyed with; whil&s;t he made his Quarters as far as ever they had been formerly from the Town; beginning his War fir&s;t upon his Wife, who had been <MILESTONE N="$$"> long in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of her own Fortune, by virtue of a Decree in <HI>Chan|cery,</HI> many years before the Troubles; and &s;ei&s;ing upon all &s;he had, and then making him&s;elf Ma&s;ter of all Their E&s;tates who were in the Ser|vice of the Parliament, without doing any thing of importance upon the Town; only upon the fir&s;t Me&s;&s;age between the Lord <HI>Roberts</HI> and Him, there aro&s;e &s;o mortal a mi&s;under&s;tanding, that there was never Civility or Quarter ob&s;erv'd between them; but &s;uch as were taken on either &s;ide, were put to the Sword; or which was wor&s;e, to the Hatler.</P>
<P>SINCE there will be often occa&s;ion to mention this Gentleman, S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> in the en&s;uing di&s;cour&s;e, and becau&s;e many Men be|liev'd, that he was hardly dealt with in the next year, where all the proceedings will be &s;et down at large, it will not be unfit, in this place, to &s;ay &s;omewhat of him, and of the manner and merit of his entring into the King's Service &s;ome Months before the time We are now upon. He was of a very ancient and worthy Family in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> which had, in &s;everal Ages, produced Men of great Courage, and very &s;ignal in their Fidelity to, and Service of the Crown; and was Him&s;elf younger Brother (though in his Nature, or Humour, not of Kin to him) to the brave S^r <HI>Bevil Greenvil,</HI> who &s;o couragiou&s;ly lo&s;t his Life in the Battle of <HI>Lan&s;down.</HI> Being a younger Brother, and a very young Man, he went into the Low Countries to learn the profe&s;&s;ion of a Soldier; to which he had dedicated him&s;elf under the greate&s;t General of that Age, Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> in the Regiment of my Lord <HI>Veere,</HI> who was General of all the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> In that Service he was look'd upon as a Man of Cou|rage, and a diligent Officer, in the quality of a Captain, to which he attain'd after few years Service. About this time, in the end of the Reign of King <HI>James,</HI> the War broke out between <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Spain;</HI> and in the expedition to <HI>Cales,</HI> this Gentleman &s;erv'd as a Major to a Regi|ment of Foot, and continued in the &s;ame Command, in the War that &s;oon after follow'd again&s;t <HI>France;</HI> and, at the I&s;le of <HI>Rhee,</HI> in&s;inuate$ him&s;elf into the very good grace of the Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> who was the General in that Inva&s;ion; and after the unfortunate retreat fro$ thence, was made Colonel of a Regiment with general Approbation, an$ as an Officer that well de&s;erv'd it.</P>
<P><PB N="413" REF="4700">
HIS credit every day encrea&s;ed with the Duke; who, out of the ge|nero&s;ity of his Nature, as a mo&s;t generous Per&s;on he was, re&s;olv'd to rai&s;e his Fortune; towards the beginning whereof, by his countenance, and &s;ollicitation, he prevailed with a rich Widow to Marry him, who had been a Lady of extraordinary Beauty, which &s;he had not yet out liv'd; and though &s;he had no great Dower by her Husband, a younger Brother of the Earl of <HI>Suffolk;</HI> yet &s;he inherited a fair Fortune of her own, near <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and was be&s;ides very rich in a per&s;onal E&s;tate, and was look'd upon as the riche&s;t Match of the We&s;t. This Lady, by the Duke's credit, S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> (for he was now made a Knight and <MILESTONE N="10"> Baronet) obtain'd; and was thereby po&s;&s;e&s;s'd of a plentiful E&s;tate upon the Borders of his own Country; where his own Family had great Cre|dit and Authority. The War being quickly at an end, and he depriv'd of his great Patron, had nothing now to depend upon but the Fortune of his Wife; which, though ample enough to have &s;upported the ex|pence a Per&s;on of his Quality ought to have made, was not large enough to &s;atisfy his vanity and ambition; nor &s;o great, $$ He, upon common reports, had promi&s;ed him&s;elf by her. By not $eing enough plea&s;ed with her Fortune, he grew le&s;s plea&s;ed with his Wife; who, being a Woman of a haughty and imperious Nature, and of a Wit &s;uperior to <MILESTONE N="20"> His, quickly re&s;ented the di&s;re&s;pect &s;he receiv'd from him; and in no degree &s;tudied to make her &s;elf ea&s;y to him. After &s;ome years &s;pent to|gether in the&s;e dome&s;tick un&s;ociable Conte&s;tations, in which he po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed him&s;elf of all her E&s;tate, as the Sole Ma&s;ter of it, without allowing her, out of her own, any competency for her &s;elf; and indulged to him&s;elf all tho&s;e Licences in her own Hou&s;e, which to Women are mo&s;t greivous, &s;he found means to withdraw her &s;elf from him; and was with all kind|ne&s;s receiv'd into that Family, in which &s;he had before been Married, and was allways very much re&s;pected.</P>
<P>HER ab&s;ence was not ingrateful to him, till the Tenants refu&s;ed to <MILESTONE N="$0"> pay him any more Rent, and he found him&s;elf on a &s;uddain deprived of her whole E&s;tate, which was all he had to live upon: for it appear'd now, that &s;he had, before her Marriage with him, &s;ettled her entire For|tune &s;o ab&s;olutely upon the Earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> that the pre&s;ent right was in Him, and he requir'd the Rents to be paid to him. This begot a Suit in the Chancery between S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> and the then Earl of <HI>Suffolk,</HI> before the Lord <HI>Coventry,</HI> who found the Conveyances in Law to be &s;o firm, that he could not only not relieve S^r <HI>Richard Green|vil</HI> in Equity, but that in Ju&s;tice he mu&s;t Decree the Land to the Earl; which he did. This very &s;en&s;ible mortification tran&s;ported him &s;o much, that, being a Man who u&s;ed to &s;peak very bitterly of tho&s;e he did not love, after all endeavours to have engaged the Earl in a per&s;onal Con|flict, he reveng'd him&s;elf upon him in &s;uch opprobrious Language, as the Government, and Ju&s;tice of that time would not permit to pa&s;s un|puni&s;hed; and the Earl appeal'd for reparation to the Court of Star-Chamber; where S^r <HI>Richard</HI> was decreed to pay three thou&s;and pounds for damages to him; and was likewi&s;e fined the Sum of three thou&s;and pounds to the King; who gave the fine likewi&s;e to the Earl: &s;o that S^r <HI>Richard</HI> was committed to the Pri&s;on of the Fleet in execution for the whole &s;ix thou&s;and pounds; which at that time was thought by all Men to be a very &s;evere and rigorous Decree, and drew a general compa&s;&s;ion towards the unhappy Gentleman.</P>
<P>AFTER he had endured many years of &s;trict Impri&s;onment, a little
<PB N="414" REF="4710">
before the beginning of the late Troubles, he made his e&s;cape out of the Pri&s;on; and tran&s;porting him&s;elf beyond the Seas, remaind there till the Parliament was call'd that produced &s;o many mi&s;eries to the King|dom; and when he heard that many Decrees which had been made, in that time, by the Court of Star-Chamber, were repealed, and the Per|&s;ons grieved, ab&s;olv'd from tho&s;e penalties, he likewi&s;e returned, and petitioned to have his Cau&s;e heard; for which a Committee was ap|pointed; but before it could be brought to any conclu&s;ion, the Rebel|lion broke out in <HI>Ireland.</HI> Among the fir&s;t Troops that were rais'd, and tran&s;ported for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion thereof, by the Parliament (to whom the King had unhappily committed the pro&s;ecution of it) S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> upon the &s;ame of being a good Officer, was &s;ent over with a very good Troop of Hor&s;e; was Major of the Earl of <HI>Leicester</HI>'s own Regiment of Hor&s;e, and was very much e&s;teem'd by him, and the more by the Parliament, for the &s;ignal Acts of cruelty he did every day com|mit upon the <HI>Iri&s;h;</HI> which were of &s;o many kinds upon both Sexes, young and old, hanging old Men who were bedrid, becau&s;e they would not di&s;cover where their Money was, that he believ'd they had; and old Women, &s;ome of Quality, after he had plundered them, and found le&s;s than he expected; that they can hardly be believ'd, though notoriou&s;ly known to be true. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>AFTER the Ce&s;&s;ation was made in <HI>Ireland,</HI> he pretended that his Con&s;cience would not give him leave to &s;tay there, and was much the more welcome to the Parliament, for declaring &s;o heartily again&s;t that Ce&s;&s;ation; and S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> being in the beginning of this year to make his expedition into the We&s;t, after the Battle of <HI>Arlesford,</HI> S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> was either commended to him, or invited by him, to command the Hor&s;e under him; which he chearfully accepted, not without many in&s;inuations, how much his Intere&s;t in <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> would advance Theirs. He receiv'd from the Parliament a <MILESTONE N="$$"> great Sum of Money, for the making his Equipage; in which he allways affected more than ordinary Lu&s;tre; and S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> communi|cated to him all his de&s;igns, with the ground and foundation of them, as to an entire Friend, and an Officer of that eminence, by who&s;e Ad|vice he meant to govern his own Conduct.</P>
<P>HIS fir&s;t and principal de&s;ign was to &s;urpri&s;e <HI>Ba&s;ing-</HI>Hou&s;e, by a corre&s;pondence with the Lord <HI>Edward Pawlet,</HI> Brother to the Mar|quis of <HI>Winche&s;ter,</HI> and then with him, as un&s;u&s;pected as a Brother ought to be. For the better execution of this, S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> was &s;ent before with a Body of the Hor&s;e, that all things might be well di&s;po&s;ed, and prepared again&s;t the time <HI>Waller</HI> him&s;elf &s;hould come to him. He appointed a Rendezvous for the Hor&s;e at <HI>Bag&s;hot,</HI> and tho &s;ame day marched out of <HI>London</HI> only with his Equipage; which was very Noble; a Coach and &s;ix Hor&s;es, a Waggon and &s;ix Hor&s;es, many led Hor&s;es, and many Servants: with tho&s;e, when he came to <HI>Stanes,</HI> he left the <HI>Bag&s;hot</HI> road, and marched directly to <HI>Reading,</HI> where the King's Garri&s;on then was; and thence, without delay, to <HI>Oxford;</HI> where he was very graciou&s;ly receiv'd by the King, and the more, becau&s;e he was not expected. He communicated then to the King the whole de|&s;ign of the &s;urpri&s;e of <HI>Ba&s;ing;</HI> upon which the King &s;ent an Expre&s;s im|mediately to the Marquis, with all the particular informations; wh$ thereupon &s;ei&s;ed upon his Brother, and the other Con&s;pirators; wh$ confe&s;s'd all, with all the circum&s;tances of the corre&s;pondence and com+bination.
<PB N="415" REF="4720">
The Marquis prevailed with the King, that he might only turn his Brother out of the Garri&s;on, after Ju&s;tice was done upon his Complices. This very happy and &s;ea&s;onable di&s;covery, pre&s;erv'd that important place; which, without it, had infallibly been lo&s;t within few days, and therefore could not but much endear the Per&s;on of the Di&s;co|verer; upon whom the Parliament thunder'd out all tho&s;e reproaches, which his de&s;erting them in &s;uch a manner was liable to; and denounced all tho&s;e judgements upon him of Attainder, Confi&s;cation, and Incapa|city of Pardon, which they u&s;ed to do again&s;t tho&s;e, who, they thought, had done them mo&s;t mi&s;chief, or again&s;t whom they were mo&s;t incen&s;ed: <MILESTONE N="10"> which was all the excu&s;e he could make for his &s;evere proceedings again&s;t tho&s;e of their Party, who fell into his hands afterwards where he com|manded.</P>
<P>FROM <HI>Oxford</HI> he went quickly into the We&s;t, before he had any Command there; declaring that he would a&s;&s;i&s;t Colonel <HI>Digby;</HI> who, upon Prince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s departure from thence with his Army, was left to Block up <HI>Plymouth;</HI> which he did with much courage and Soldierly ability. To Him he had Letters from the King, that he &s;hould put S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> into the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Wifes E&s;tate, that lay within his Quarters, and which was ju&s;tly liable to a Seque&s;tration by her living <MILESTONE N="$0"> in <HI>London,</HI> and being too zealou&s;ly of that Party; which the Colonel punctually did. And &s;o he came, after &s;o many years, to be again po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ed of all that E&s;tate; which was what he mo&s;t &s;et his heart upon.</P>
<P>ONE day he made a Vi&s;it from his Hou&s;e, which he call'd his own, to the Colonel; and dined with him; and the Colonel civilly &s;ent half a dozen Troopers to wait on him home, le$t any of the Garri&s;on, in their u&s;ual Excur&s;ions, might meet with him. In his return home, he &s;aw four or five fellows, coming out of a Neighbour Wood, with Burthens of Wood upon their backs, which they had &s;tolen. He bid the Troopers fetch tho&s;e fellows to him; and finding that they were Soldiers of the Garri&s;on, he made one of them hang all the re&s;t; which, to &s;ave his own Life, he was contented to do: &s;o &s;trong his appetite was to tho&s;e Executions he had been accu&s;tom'd to in <HI>Ireland,</HI> without any kind of Commi&s;&s;ion or pretence of Authority.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after, upon a Salley made with Hor&s;e and Foot from the Town, Colonel <HI>Digby</HI> (who be&s;ides the keenne&s;s of his Courage had a more compo&s;ed under&s;tanding, and le&s;s liable to fumes, than &s;ome of his Family who had &s;harper parts) Charging them with &s;uch vigour as routed, and drove them back, receiv'd him&s;elf in the clo&s;e an unhappy wound, with a Rapier, in the Eye; which pierced near his brain; &s;o that, though he was brought off by his Soldiers, it was very long before he recover'd enough to endure the Air, and never did the Effects of the Wound. Upon this Accident, S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> was placed in that Command, which he executed for &s;ome Months; until, upon the Ad|vance of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> he was compelled to retire into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> where We found him at the King's coming thither.</P>
<P>THIS &s;o large excur&s;ion upon a private Per&s;on may &s;eem very extra|$agant, and to carry in it too much Animo&s;ity again&s;t the memory of a Man who did &s;ome things well, and was not without &s;ome merit in $he King's Service: but they who know the Occurrences of the next year, which will be faithfully related, and con&s;ider the &s;everity that he compelled the Prince to u&s;e towards him, of which he made a great $oi&s;e afterwards in the world, and prevailed with &s;ome good Men to
<PB N="416" REF="4730">
believe that the proceeding again&s;t him was too rigorous, and that the Council then about the Prince had &s;ome per&s;onal di&s;re&s;pect towards him, may rea&s;onably believe, that this enlargement was in &s;ome degree nece&s;&s;ary, that &s;uch a Man's Original, Nature, Manners, and Di&s;po&s;ition, &s;hould be manife&s;t and clearly under&s;tood.</P>
<P>THE King was now mo&s;t intent to return into his Winter Quarters at <HI>Oxford,</HI> which was all he could propo&s;e to him&s;elf; in which he ex|pected to meet with all the ob&s;tructions and difficulties his enraged Ene|mies could lay in his way. He knew well that <HI>Waller</HI> was even ready to come out of <HI>London,</HI> and that <HI>Middleton</HI> was retired from <HI>Tiverton</HI> to joyn with him; that they had &s;ent for the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> to <MILESTONE N="1$"> march towards the We&s;t with his Victorious Army: So that, if he long deferr'd his march, he mu&s;t look to Fight another Battle, before he could reach <HI>Oxford.</HI> Notwith&s;tanding all which, his Army that had been upon hard duty, and had made long marches above &s;ix Months together, required &s;ome re&s;t and refre&s;hment; the Foot were without Cloaths, and Shooes; and the Hor&s;e in &s;uch ill humour, that without Money they would be more di&s;contented. To provide the be&s;t remedy that could be applied to the&s;e evils, the next day after the King marched from <HI>Plymouth,</HI> him&s;elf, attended only by his own Troop, and the prin|cipal Officers of the Court, went to <HI>Exeter;</HI> appointing the Army, by <MILESTONE N="2$"> &s;low marches, to follow, and to be Quarter'd at <HI>Tiverton,</HI> and the other Towns adjacent; where they arriv'd on the 21^&s;^t of <HI>September.</HI></P>
<P>HIS Maje&s;ty now quickly di&s;cern'd how continual hard duty, with little fighting, had le&s;&s;en'd and dimini&s;h'd his Army. His own Body of Foot, which when he enter'd <HI>Cornwal,</HI> were above four thou&s;and, was at this time much fewer; and Prince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s, which con&s;i&s;ted of full four thou&s;and five hundred, when the King fir&s;t view'd them at <HI>Kirton,</HI> was not now half the Number. Of all the Forces under <HI>Greenvil,</HI> which had made &s;o much noi&s;e, and had been thought worthy of the Name of an Army, there were only five hundred Foot, and three hundred Hor&s;e <MILESTONE N="30"> left with him, for the Blocking up <HI>Plymouth;</HI> the re&s;t were dwindled away; or el&s;e, which was his u&s;ual Artifice, he had encouraged them to &s;tay for &s;ome time in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and then to repair to him, as many of them did; for his Forces &s;uddainly encrea&s;ed; and the truth is, few of the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> marched Ea&s;tward with the King. The King's Hor&s;e were harra&s;ed, and many of them dead in the marches; which contributed to the di&s;content of the Riders; &s;o that great Provi&s;ions were to be made before they could begin a new march. By the diligence and acti|vity of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, appointed in <HI>Devon-&s;hire</HI> for tho&s;e Affairs, his Maje&s;ty was within few days &s;upplied with two thou&s;and pounds in <MILESTONE N="4$"> Money, which was pre&s;ently di&s;tributed among the Hor&s;e; and three thou&s;and Suits of Cloaths, with good proportions of Shooes and Stock|ings; which were likewi&s;e deliver'd to the Foot. What remain'd yet wanting for the Hor&s;e and Foot, was promi&s;ed to meet them, upon their fir&s;t entrance into <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire;</HI> where the Commi&s;&s;ioners of that County, had undertaken they &s;hould be ready.</P>
<P>THERE was another thing of equal importance to be provided for, before the King left <HI>Exeter;</HI> which was, the Blocking up the Troops of <HI>Lyme;</HI> which were grown more in&s;olent by the Succe&s;s they had had and made Incur&s;ions &s;ometimes even to the Walls of <HI>Exeter;</HI> and to re&s;train a &s;tronger Garri&s;on in <HI>Taunton.</HI> For when Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> rai&s;ed his Siege from <HI>Lyme,</HI> he had very unhappily drawn out the Garri&s;on o$

<HI>Taunton,</HI> which con&s;i&s;ted of eight hundred Men, under the Command of S^r <HI>John Stawel,</HI> a Per&s;on of that eminent Courage and Fidelity, that he would never have given it up; and left only four&s;core Men in the Ca&s;tle to be kept by a Lieutenant, who ba&s;ely gave it up, a&s;&s;oon as <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> in his pa&s;&s;age demanded it; for which he de&s;ervedly afterwards &s;uffer'd Death. And it was now, by the Garri&s;on the Earl put into it, and the extreme malignity and pride of the Inhabitants, in both which they ex|ceeded, become a &s;harp Thorn in the &s;ides of all that populous County.</P>
<P>To remedy the fir&s;t of the&s;e, &s;ome Troops which depended upon the Garri&s;on of <HI>Exeter,</HI> were a&s;&s;ign'd, and were to receive Orders from S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> Governour thereof; who was the more vacant for that <MILESTONE N="10"> Service by the reduction of <HI>Barn&s;table;</HI> which was done during the King's &s;tay at <HI>Exeter.</HI> The other of <HI>Taunton,</HI> was more unhappily com|mitted to Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Bridgewater;</HI> who, though a Gentleman of known Courage and unque&s;tionable Fidelity, by the Divi&s;ions and Factions in the Country, was not equal to the work. To di&s;patch all this, the King &s;tayed not a $ull week at <HI>Exeter;</HI> but ha&s;ten'd his march to <HI>Chard</HI> in <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> where he &s;tayed lon|ger; for which he paid dear after; for he might otherwi&s;e have reached <HI>Oxford,</HI> before the Enemy was in a conjunction &s;trong enough to &s;top <MILESTONE N="20"> him: yet even that &s;tay could not be prevented, except he would have left the Money and Cloaths (which the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire</HI> promi&s;ed, and did deliver there at la&s;t) behind him; which would not have been grateful to the Army.</P>
<P>IT was the la&s;t of <HI>September,</HI> that the King marched from <HI>Chard;</HI> and Quarter'd that Night at a Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Pawlets,</HI> where Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> met him, and gave him an account of the unhappy Affairs of the North, and that he had left about two thou&s;and Hor&s;e under the Command of S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale;</HI> which he might as well have brought with him, and then the King would have had a glorious end of his We&s;tern Expedition. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> pre&s;ently return'd to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> with Orders, a&s;&s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible, to march, with tho&s;e Northern Hor&s;e under S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> and two thou&s;and Foot, which were in <HI>Wales,</HI> under Colonel <HI>Charles Gerrard,</HI> into <HI>Glouce&s;ter-&s;hire;</HI> by which the Enemy might be obliged to divide their Force, which if they &s;hould &s;till keep united, the Prince from thence would be able to joyn with the King: But the&s;e Orders were not executed in time. The King's Ar|my at this time con&s;i&s;ted in the whole but of five thou&s;and five hundred Foot, and about four thou&s;and Hor&s;e; and <HI>Waller</HI> was already come with his Hor&s;e to <HI>Blanford;</HI> but &s;ome of his Troops being beaten up by tho&s;e of the King's, he retired to <HI>Shaftsbury,</HI> and tho&s;e parts of <HI>Wilt|&s;hire</HI> adjacent. It concern'd the King very much, before he left tho&s;e $arts, to relieve <HI>Portland-</HI>Ca&s;tle, which had been now Be&s;ieged from $he time of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s march that way. To that purpo&s;e, he $arched to <HI>Sherborne;</HI> where he &s;tayed &s;ix days too long, though in that time he rai&s;ed the Siege before <HI>Portland-</HI>Ca&s;tle, if he had not hoped $y that delay that his Nephew Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> would have been well ad|vanced in his march. S^r <HI>Lewis Dives</HI> was left with his own Regiment $f one hundred and fifty old Soldiers, and &s;ome Hor&s;e in <HI>Sherborne-</HI>$a&s;tle, and made Commander in Chief of <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire;</HI> in hope that he $ould be able &s;hortly by his activity and the very good affection of that $ounty, to rai&s;e Men enough to recover <HI>Weymouth:</HI> and he did per|$$rm all that could be rea&s;onably expected from him. His Maje&s;ty had

a great de&s;ire, in his march to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to relieve <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle, and <HI>Ba&s;ing;</HI> which was again Be&s;ieged by allmo&s;t the whole Army of the Enemy; and then to &s;end a good Party to relieve <HI>Banbury,</HI> which had been clo&s;e Be&s;ieged by Colonel <HI>John Fiennes,</HI> another Son of the Lord <HI>Say,</HI> with all the Forces of <HI>Northampton-&s;hire, Warwick,</HI> and <HI>Coventry;</HI> and bravely defended by S^r <HI>William Compton,</HI> full three Months; but by this time reduced to the utmo&s;t extremity.</P>
<P>IN order to pre&s;erve all this, the King came to <HI>Salisbury</HI> upon the fifteenth of <HI>October;</HI> <Q>where he under&s;tood, &startq;that <HI>Waller</HI> lay at <HI>Ando|ver</HI> with his Troops; that <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> was advanced as far as <HI>Reading</HI> with five thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, and four and twenty pieces of <MILESTONE N="10"> Ordnance; and that four Regiments of the Train'd-bands of <HI>London,</HI> were beginning their march to him; and that three thou&s;and of the Hor&s;e and Foot of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Army were near <HI>Port&s;mouth,&endq;</HI> expecting Orders to joyn with the re&s;t.</Q> This might very well have di&s;po&s;ed his Maje&s;ty to have ha&s;ten'd his march to <HI>Oxford,</HI> which would have made a fair conclu&s;ion of the Campagne; and this was the more rea&s;onable, becau&s;e here the King receiv'd Letters from Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> in which he declared, <Q>&startq;that it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to bring up his&endq; Troops &s;o &s;oon as his Maje&s;ty expected;</Q> and indeed as his pre&s;ent con|dition required: and if this had been re&s;olv'd, both <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle, <MILESTONE N="20"> and <HI>Banbury,</HI> might have been &s;ea&s;onably &s;et at liberty; but a great gayety po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Goring,</HI> that he earne&s;tly advi&s;ed the King to march, with &s;ecrecy and expedition, to beat <HI>Waller;</HI> who lay at <HI>Andover,</HI> a good di&s;tance from the re&s;t, with three thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Dragoons; which the King, upon the unanimous con&s;ent of the Council, con|&s;ented to.</P>
<P>HE had left all the Cannon that he had taken from <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> in <HI>Exeter;</HI> and now he &s;ent all his great Cannon to a Garri&s;on he had within two Miles of <HI>Salisbury</HI> at <HI>Langford,</HI> a Hou&s;e of the Lord <HI>Gorges;</HI> where was a Garri&s;on of one hundred Men, commanded by a good Officer. <MILESTONE N="30"> The re&s;t of the Cannon and Carriages were left at <HI>Wilton,</HI> the Hou&s;e of the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> with a Regiment of Foot to guard them; and the King appointed the Rendezvous for the Army to be the next Morn|ing, by &s;even of the Clock, near <HI>Clarendon-</HI>Park; and good Guards were &s;et at all the Avenues of the City, to keep all People from going out, that <HI>Waller</HI> might not have any notice of his purpo&s;e: and if the hour of the Rendezvous had been ob&s;erv'd, as it rarely was (though his Ma|je&s;ty was him&s;elf the mo&s;t punctual, and never ab&s;ent at the preci&s;e time) that de&s;ign had &s;ucceeded to wi&s;h. For though the Foot under <MILESTONE N="4$"> Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> came not up till eleven of the Clock, &s;o that the Army did not begin it's march till twelve, yet they came within four Miles of <HI>Andover,</HI> before <HI>Waller</HI> had any Notice of their Motions; when he drew out his whole Body towards them, as if he meant to Fight; but upon view of their &s;trength, and the good order they were in, he changed his mind, and drew back into the Town; leaving a &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e and Dragoons to make good his Retreat. But the King's Van Charged, and Routed them with good execution, and pur&s;ued them through the Town, and &s;lew many of them in the Rear, until the dark|ne&s;s of the Night &s;ecured them, and hinder'd the others from following farther. But they were all &s;catter'd, and came not quickly together again; and the King Quarter'd that Night at <HI>Andover.</HI> The &s;cattering this great Body under <HI>Waller</HI> in this manner, and the little re&s;i&s;tance

they made, &s;o rai&s;ed the Spirits of the King's Army, that they de&s;ired nothing more than to have a Battle with the whole Army of the Ene|my; which the King meant not to &s;eek out, nor to decline Fighting with them, if they put them&s;elves in his way. And &s;o he re&s;olv'd to rai&s;e the Siege of <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle, which was little out of his way to <HI>Oxford.</HI> To that purpo&s;e, he &s;ent orders for the Cannon which had been left at <HI>Langford,</HI> and <HI>Wilton,</HI> to make all ha&s;t to a place appointed between <HI>Andover,</HI> and <HI>Newbury;</HI> where he &s;tayed with his Army, till they came up to him; and then marched together to <HI>Newbury,</HI> within a Mile of <HI>Donnington.</HI></P>
<P>THE Blockade of <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle had been (when <HI>Middleton</HI> from <MILESTONE N="10"> thence pur&s;ued his march into the We&s;t) left to the care of Colonel <HI>Horton;</HI> who for &s;ome time was contented to Block it up; but then finding his Summons neglected, and that they had &s;tore of Provi&s;ions within, and having an Addition of Forces from <HI>Abingdon</HI> and <HI>Reading,</HI> he re&s;olv'd to Be&s;iege it; which he begun to do the 29^t^h of <HI>September;</HI> and made his Approaches, and rai&s;ed a Battery on the foot of the Hill next <HI>Newbury,</HI> and plyed it &s;o with his great Cannon, that, after twelve days continual &s;hooting, he beat down three Towers and a part of the Wall; which he believ'd had &s;o humbled the Governour and the Garri|&s;on, that they would be no longer &s;o &s;tubborne as they had been; and <MILESTONE N="20"> therefore he &s;ent them another Summons, in which he magnified his own clemency, <Q>&startq;that prevailed with him, now they were even at his mercy, to offer them Quarter for their Lives, if they gave up the Ca&s;tle before <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> at ten of the Clock in the Morning; but if that his favour was not accepted, he declared, in the pre&s;ence of God, that&endq; there &s;hould no Man among&s;t them have his Life &s;pared.</Q> The Go|vernour made him&s;elf merry with his high and threatning Language; and &s;ent him word, <Q>&startq;he would keep the place, and would neither give&endq; nor receive Quarter.</Q> At this time, the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> him&s;elf <MILESTONE N="30"> with his Forces came to <HI>Newbury;</HI> and receiving no better An&s;wer to his own Summons, than <HI>Horton</HI> had done before, he re&s;olv'd to Storm it the next day. But his Soldiers, being well inform'd of the re&s;olution of tho&s;e within, declined that hot Service; and plyed it with their Ar|tillery until the next Night; and then removed their Battery to the other &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle; and begun their Approaches by Saps; when the Governour made a &s;trong Sally, and beat them out of their Trenches, and kill'd a Lieutenant Colonel, who commanded in Chief, with many Soldiers; &s;hot their Chief Cannoneer through the Head, brought away their Cannon Baskets, and many Armes, and retired with very little lo&s;s: yet the next Night they fini&s;hed their Battery: and continued &s;ome days their great &s;hot, till they heard of the Approach of the King's Army; whereupon they drew off their Ordnance, and their Train'd-bands of <HI>London</HI> being not yet come to them, the Earl thought fit to march away to a greater di&s;tance; there having been, in nineteen days, above one thou&s;and great &s;hot &s;pent upon the Walls, without any other damage to the Garri&s;on, than the beating down &s;ome old parts thereof.</P>
<P>WHEN the King came to <HI>Newbury,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Donnington</HI> attended him; and was Knighted for his very good behaviour; and there was then &s;o little apprehen&s;ion of dread of the Enemy, that his Maje&s;ty thought not of pro&s;ecuting his Journey towards <HI>Oxford,</HI> before $e &s;hould Relieve both <HI>Ba&s;ing</HI> and <HI>Banbury.</HI> And now importunities $eing &s;ent from the la&s;t, which was even upon the point of rendering

But two, or three &s;hots, made at them by a Couple of Drakes brought from <HI>Oxford</HI> by Colonel <HI>Gage,</HI> made them &s;tagger, and retire from their ground very di&s;orderly. Their Cannon and Baggage had been &s;ent out of the Town the Night before; and their Foot, being above &s;even hundred, run out of <HI>Banbury</HI> upon the fir&s;t advance of the King's Troops. Colonel <HI>Gage</HI> with the Foot went directly to the Ca&s;tle, that they might be at Liberty; whil&s;t the Earl of <HI>Northampton</HI> follow'd the Hor&s;e &s;o clo&s;ely, that they found it be&s;t to make a &s;tand; where he furiou&s;ly Charged and Routed them; and, notwith&s;tanding they had lined &s;ome Hedges with Mu&s;queteers, pur&s;ued them till they were &s;cat|ter'd, and totally di&s;per&s;ed; their General, young <HI>Fiennes,</HI> continuing <MILESTONE N="2$"> his flight, till he came to <HI>Coventry,</HI> without &s;taying. The Foot, for the mo&s;t part, by di&s;per&s;ing them&s;elves, e&s;caped by the Inclo&s;ures, before Colonel <HI>Gage</HI> could come up. But there were taken, in the Cha&s;e, one Field piece, and three Waggons of Armes and Ammunition; many &s;lain; and two Officers of Hor&s;e, with near one hundred other Pri&s;oners, four Cornets of Hor&s;e, and two hundred Hor&s;es, were taken; and all this with the lo&s;s of one Captain and nine Troopers; &s;ome Officers, and others, being wounded, but not mortally. Thus the Siege was rai&s;ed from <HI>Ban|bury;</HI> which had continued full thirteen Weeks; &s;o notably defended, <MILESTONE N="$$"> that though they had but two Hor&s;es left uneaten, they had never &s;uf|fer'd a Summons to be &s;ent to them; and it was now Reliev'd the very day of the Month upon which both Town and Ca&s;tle had been render'd to the King two years before; being the 26^t^h of <HI>October.</HI></P>
<P>THOUGH the Relief of <HI>Banbury</HI> &s;ucceeded to wi&s;h, yet the King paid dear for it &s;oon after: the very day after that Service was perform'd, Colonel <HI>Hurry,</HI> a <HI>Scotch-</HI>man, who had formely &s;erv'd the Parliament, and is well mention'd, in the tran&s;actions of the la&s;t year, for having quitted them, and perform'd &s;ome &s;ignal Service to the King, had in the We&s;t, about the time the King enter'd into <HI>Cornwal</HI> (in a di&s;contented humour, which was very natural to him) de&s;ired a Pa&s;s to go beyond the Seas; and &s;o quitted the Service: but in&s;tead of embarking him&s;elf, made ha&s;t to <HI>London;</HI> and put him&s;elf now into the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI>'s Army, and made a di&s;covery of all he knew of the King's Army, and a de&s;cription of the Per&s;ons and Cu&s;tomes of tho&s;e who principally com|manded; &s;o that as they well knew the con&s;titution, and weakne&s;s of the King's Army, they had al&s;o Adverti&s;ement of the Earl of <HI>Northam|pton</HI>'s being gone, with three Regiments of Hor&s;e, to the Relief of <HI>Ban|bury.</HI> Whereupon, within two days after, all tho&s;e Forces which had been under <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Waller,</HI> being united with <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> (with whom likewi&s;e the Train'd-bands of <HI>London</HI> were now joyn'd; all which made up a Body of above eight thou&s;and Foot; the number of thei$ Hor&s;e being not Inferior) advanced towards the King, who had not ha$

<P>IT was now too late to hope to make a Safe retreat to <HI>Oxford,</HI> when the whole Body of the Enemies Army, which had receiv'd po&s;itive Or|ders <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The &s;econd Battle of</HI> Newbury.</NOTE> to Fight the King a&s;&s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible, appear'd as near as <HI>Thack|ham;</HI> &s;o that his Maje&s;ty not at all di&s;may'd, re&s;olv'd to &s;tand upon the Defen&s;ive only; hoping that, upon the advantage he had of the Town of <HI>Newbury</HI> and the River, the Enemy would not &s;peedily Advance; and that in the mean time, by being compell'd to lodge in the Field, <MILESTONE N="10"> which grew now to be very Cold, whil&s;t his Army was under cover, they might be forced to retire. The King quarter'd in the Town of <HI>New|bury;</HI> and placed &s;trong Guards on the South of the Town: but the greate&s;t part of the Army was placed towards the Enemies Quarters, in a good Hou&s;e belonging to M^r <HI>Doleman</HI> at <HI>Shaw,</HI> and in a Village near it, defended by the River that runs under <HI>Donnington</HI> Ca&s;tle, and in a Hou&s;e between that Village and <HI>Newbury,</HI> about which a Work was ca&s;t up, and at a Mill upon the River of <HI>Kennet;</HI> all which lay almo&s;t Ea&s;t from the Town. Directly North from thence were two open Fields, where mo&s;t of the Hor&s;e &s;tood with the Train of Artillery, and about half a <MILESTONE N="20"> mile We&s;t, was the Village of <HI>Speen;</HI> and beyond it a &s;mall Heath. In this Village lay all Prince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s Foot, and &s;ome Hor&s;e, and at the Entrance of the Heath a work was ca&s;t up, which clear'd the Heath. In this po&s;ture they had many Skirmi&s;hes with the Enemy for two days, without lo&s;ing any ground; and the Enemy was &s;till beaten off with lo&s;s.</P>
<P>ON <HI>Sunday</HI> Morning, the &s;even and twentieth of <HI>October,</HI> by the break of day, one thou&s;and of the Earl of <HI>Manchester</HI>'s Army, with the Train'd-bands of <HI>London,</HI> came down the Hill; and pa&s;&s;ed the River that way by <HI>Shaw;</HI> and, undi&s;cover'd, forced that Guard which &s;hould have <MILESTONE N="30"> kept the Pa&s;s near the Hou&s;e; that was entrenched where S^r <HI>Bernard Astley</HI> lay; who in&s;tantly, with a good Body of Mu&s;queteers, fell upon the Enemy; and not only routed them, but compell'd them to rout two other Bodies of their own Men, who were coming to &s;econd them. In this pur&s;uit very many of the Enemy were &s;lain, and many drown'd in the River, and above two hundred Arms taken. There continued, all that day, very warm Skirmi&s;hes in &s;everal parts; the Enemies Army having allmo&s;t encompa&s;&s;ed the King's; and with much more lo&s;s to Them, than to the King; till, about three of the Clock in the Afternoon, <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Waller</HI> with his own, and the Forces which had been under <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> fell upon the Quarter at <HI>Speen,</HI> and pa&s;&s;ed the River; which was not well defended by the Officer who was appointed to guard it with Hor&s;e and Foot, very many of them being gone off from their Guards, as never imagining that they would, at that time of day, have attempted a Quar|ter that was thought the &s;tronge&s;t of all. But having thus got the River, they marched in good Order, with very great Bodies of Foot, winged with Hor&s;e, towards the Heath; from whence the Hor&s;e which were left there, with too little re&s;i&s;tance, retir'd; being in truth much over|power'd, by rea&s;on the Major part of them, upon confidence of &s;ecu|rity <MILESTONE N="50"> of the Pa&s;s, were gone to provide Forage for their Hor&s;e.</P>
<P>BY this means, the Enemy po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed them&s;elves of the Ordnance which had been planted there; and of the Village of <HI>Speen;</HI> the Foot
<PB N="422" REF="4790">
which were there, retir'd to the Hedge next the large Field between <HI>Speen</HI> and <HI>Newbury;</HI> which they made good: at the &s;ame time, the right Wing of the Enemies Hor&s;e advanced under the Hill of <HI>Speen,</HI> with one hundred Mu&s;queteers in the Van, and came into the open Field, where a good Body of the Kings Hor&s;e &s;tood; which at fir&s;t receiv'd them in &s;ome di&s;order; but the Queen's Regiment of Hor&s;e, commanded by S^r <HI>John Cansfeild,</HI> charged them with &s;o much Gallantry, that he routed that great Body; which then fled; and he had the execution of them near half a mile; wherein mo&s;t of the Mu&s;queteers were &s;lain, and very many of the Hor&s;e; in&s;omuch that that whole Wing rallied not again that night. The King was at that time with the Prince, and many of the <MILESTONE N="10"> Lords, and other his Servants, in the middle of that Field; and could not, by his own Pre&s;ence, re&s;train tho&s;e Hor&s;e which at the fir&s;t approach of the Enemy were in that di&s;order, from &s;hamefully giving Ground. So that if S^r <HI>John Cansfeild</HI> had not, in that Article of Time, given them that brisk Charge, by which other Troops were ready to charge them in the Flank, the King him&s;elf had been in very great danger.</P>
<P>AT the &s;ame time, the left Wing of the Enemies Hor&s;e advanced to|wards the North-&s;ide of the great Field; but before they got thither, <HI>Goring</HI> with the Earl of <HI>Cleveland</HI>'s Brigade, charg'd them &s;o vigorou&s;|ly, that he forced them back in great confu&s;ion over a Hedge; and follow|ing <MILESTONE N="20"> them, was charged by another fre&s;h Body; which he defeated like|wi&s;e, and &s;lew very many of the Enemy upon the place; having not only routed and beaten them off their ground, but endur'd the Shot of three Bodies of their Foot in their pur&s;uit, and in their retreat, with no con|&s;iderable damage, &s;ave that the Earl of <HI>Cleveland</HI>'s Hor&s;e falling under him, he was taken Pri&s;oner; which was an extraordinary lo&s;s. Whil&s;t this was doing on that &s;ide, twelve hundred Hor&s;e, and three thou&s;and Foot, of tho&s;e under the Earl of <HI>Manchester,</HI> advanced with great Re|&s;olution upon <HI>Shaw-</HI>Hou&s;e, and the Field adjacent; which quarter was <MILESTONE N="30"> defended by S^r <HI>Jacob A&s;hley,</HI> and Colonel <HI>George Li&s;le;</HI> and the Hou&s;e, by Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Page.</HI> They came &s;inging of P&s;alms; and, at fir&s;t, drove forty Mu&s;queteers from a Hedge, who were placed there to &s;top them; but they were pre&s;ently Charg'd by S^r <HI>John Brown</HI> with the Prince's Regiment of Hor&s;e; who did good execution upon them, till he &s;aw another Body of their Hor&s;e ready to charge him, which made him retire to the Foot in M^r <HI>Doleman</HI>'s Garden, which flanked that Field, and give fire upon tho&s;e Hor&s;e, whereof very many &s;ell; and the Hor&s;e there|upon Wheeling about, S^r <HI>John Brown</HI> fell upon their Rear, kill'd many, and kept that Ground all the day; when the Re&s;erve of Foot, command|ed <MILESTONE N="40"> by Colonel <HI>Thelwell,</HI> gall'd their Foot with &s;everal Vollies; and then fell on them with the But-ends of their Mu&s;quets, till they had not only beaten them from the Hedges, but quite out of the Field; leaving two Drakes, &s;ome Colours, and many dead Bodies behind them. At this time, a great Body of their Foot attempted M^r <HI>Doleman</HI>'s Hou&s;e, but were &s;o well entertain'd by Liuetenant Colonel <HI>Page,</HI> that after they had made their fir&s;t effort, they were forced to retire in &s;uch Confu&s;ion, that he pur&s;u'd them from the Hou&s;e with a notable Execution; in&s;omuch that they le&s;t five hundred dead upon a little &s;pot of ground; and they drew off the two Drakes out of the Field to the Hou&s;e, the Enemy being beaten off, and retir'd from all that Quarter.</P>
<P>IT was now night; for which neither Party was &s;orry; and the King, who had been on that &s;ide where the Enemy only had prevail'd, thought
<PB N="423" REF="4800">
that his Army had &s;uffer'd alike in all other places. He &s;aw they were entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Speen,</HI> and had taken all the Ordnance which had been left there; whereby it would be ea&s;y for them, before the next morning, to have compa&s;&s;ed him round; towards which they might have gone far, if they had found them&s;elves in a condition to have pur|&s;ued their fortune.</P>
<P>HEREUPON, a&s;&s;oon as it was night, his Maje&s;ty, with the Prince, and tho&s;e Lords who had been about him all the day, and his Regiment of Guards, retired into the Fields under <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle, and re&s;olv'd to pro&s;ecute the re&s;olution that was taken in the morning, when they &s;aw <MILESTONE N="10"> the great Advantage the Enemy had in numbers, with which he was like to be encompa&s;&s;ed, if his Forces were beaten from either of the Po&s;ts. That re&s;olution was, <Q>&startq;to march away in the night towards <HI>Walling|ford;&endq;</HI></Q> and to that purpo&s;e, all the Carriages, and great Ordnance, had been that Morning drawn under <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle; &s;o he &s;ent Orders to all the Officers, to draw off their Men to the &s;ame Place; and receiv|ing Intelligence at that time that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was come, or would be that night at <HI>Bath,</HI> that he might make no &s;tay there, but pre&s;ently be able to joyn with his Army, his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf, with the Prince, and about three hundred Hor&s;e, made ha&s;t thither; and found Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> there; and thence made what ha&s;t they could back towards <HI>Oxford.</HI> The truth is, the Kings Army was not in &s;o ill a condition, as the King conceiv'd it to have been: that Party which were in the Field near <HI>Speen,</HI> kept their ground very re&s;olutely; and although it was a fair Moon|&s;hine night, the Enemy, that was very near them, and much &s;uperior in Number, thought not fit to a&s;&s;ault or di&s;turb them. That part of the Enemy that had been &s;o roughly treated at <HI>Shaw,</HI> having receiv'd Suc|cour of a &s;trong Body of Hor&s;e, re&s;olv'd once more to make an attempt upon the Foot there; but they were beaten off as before; though they &s;tood not well enough to receive an equal lo&s;s, but retir'd to their Hill, <MILESTONE N="30"> where they &s;tood &s;till. This was the la&s;t Action between the Armies; for about ten of the Clock at night, all the Army, Hor&s;e, Foot, and Cannon, upon the King's Orders, drew forth their &s;everal Guards to the Heath about <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle; in which they left mo&s;t of their wounded Men, with all their Ordnance, Ammunition, and Carriages; then Prince <HI>Mau|rice,</HI> and the other Officers, marched in good Order away to <HI>Walling|ford;</HI> committing the bringing up the Rear to S^r <HI>Humphrey Bennet</HI> (who had behav'd him&s;elf very Signally that day) who with his Brigade of Hor&s;e marched behind, and receiv'd not the lea&s;t di&s;turbance from the <MILESTONE N="$$"> Enemy; who, in &s;o light a Night, could not but know of the Retreat, and were well enough pleas'd to be rid of an Enemy that had handled them &s;o ill. By the Morning, all the Army, Foot as well as Hor&s;e, arriv'd at <HI>Wallingford;</HI> where having Refre&s;hed a little, they marched to <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> without &s;eeing any Party of the Enemy that looked after them.</P>
<P>MANY made a Que&s;tion which Party had the better of the Day; and neither was well enough &s;atisfied with their Succe&s;s. There could be no que&s;tion there were very many more kill'd of the Enemy, than of the King's Army; whereof were mi&s;&s;ing, only S^r <HI>William</HI> S^t <HI>Leger,</HI> Lieute|nant Colonel to the Dukes Regiment of Foot; Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Top|ping,</HI> and Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Leake,</HI> both Officers of Hor&s;e, who were all there &s;lain, with not above one hundred Common Soldiers, in all places. The Earl of <HI>Brentford,</HI> General of the Army, was wounded on the head; S^r <HI>John Cansfeild,</HI> S^r <HI>John Greenvil,</HI> and Lieutenant
<PB N="424" REF="4810">
Colonel <HI>Page,</HI> were wounded; but all recover'd. The Officers of the Enemies &s;ide were never talk'd of, being, for the mo&s;t part, of no better Families than the Common Soldiers. But it was rea&s;onably computed, by tho&s;e who &s;aw the Action in all places, that there could not be &s;o few as one thou&s;and dead upon the place: yet becau&s;e the King's Army quitted the Field, and marched away in the Night, the other &s;ide thought them&s;elves Ma&s;ters; and the Parliament celebrated their Victory with their u&s;ual Triumphs; though, within few days after, they di&s;cern'd that they had little rea&s;on for it. They came to know, by what accident was not imagin'd, that the Earl of <HI>Brentford</HI> remain'd that night in the Ca&s;tle, by rea&s;on of the hurt in his Head, and &s;o &s;ent Colonel <HI>Hurry</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> to him to per&s;wade him to give up the Ca&s;tle, and to make him other large Offers; all which the General rejected with the Indignation that became him. No more &s;hall be &s;aid of the Colonel, becau&s;e, after all his tergiver&s;ations, he cho&s;e at la&s;t to lo&s;e his Life for, and in the King's Service; which ought to expiate for all his tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions, and pre&s;erve his memory from all unkind Reflections.</P>
<P>THE next day, when they knew that the King's Army was retired, and not till then, they made ha&s;t to po&s;&s;e&s;s them&s;elves of <HI>Newbury;</HI> and then drew up their whole Army before <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle, <Q>and &s;um|mon'd the Governour &startq;to deliver it to them, or el&s;e they would not&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> leave one Stone upon another.</Q> To which the Governour made no other reply, <Q>than &startq;that he was not bound to repair it; but however&endq; he would, by God's help, keep the ground afterwards:</Q> &s;eeing his ob&s;ti|nacy, <Q>they offer'd him &startq;to march away with the Armes, and all things&endq; belonging to the Garri&s;on;</Q> <Q>and, when that moved not, &startq;that he &s;hould&endq; carry all the Cannon,</Q> and Ammunition with him; to all which he An|&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;that he wonder'd they would not be &s;atisfied with &s;o many&endq; An&s;wers that he had &s;ent,</Q> <Q>and de&s;ired them &startq;to be a&s;&s;ured, that he&endq; would not go out of the Ca&s;tle,</Q> till the King &s;ent him Order &s;o to do. <MILESTONE N="30"> Offended with the&s;e high An&s;wers, they re&s;olv'd to A&s;&s;ault it; but the Officer who commanded the Party, being kill'd with &s;ome few of the Sol|diers, they retired; and never after made any attempt upon it; but re|main'd quietly at <HI>Newbury</HI> in great Faction among them&s;elves; every Man taking upon him&s;elf to find fault, and cen&s;ure what had been done, and had been left undone, in the whole days Service.</P>
<P>THE King met Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> as he expected, with Colonel <HI>Gerrard,</HI> and S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale;</HI> and made all the ha&s;t he could to joyn tho&s;e Forces with his own Army, that &s;o he might march back to <HI>New|bury,</HI> and di&s;engage his Cannon, and Carriages. By the way he met the <MILESTONE N="40"> Earl of <HI>Northampton,</HI> and tho&s;e Regiments which had Reliev'd <HI>Ban|bury;</HI> and having with marvellous Expedition cau&s;ed a new Train of Artillery to be form'd, he brought his Army again to a Rendezvous on <HI>Bullington-</HI>Green; where, with the Addition of tho&s;e Forces, and &s;ome Foot, which he drew out of <HI>Oxford,</HI> under the Command of Colonel <HI>Gage,</HI> it appear'd to be full &s;ix thou&s;and Foot, and five thou&s;and Hor&s;e; with which he marched to <HI>Wallingford;</HI> and within a day more than a Week after he had left <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle, found him&s;elf there again in <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|lieves</HI> Don|nington<HI>-Ca|&s;tle.</HI></NOTE> &s;o good a po&s;ture, that he re&s;olv'd not to decline Fighting with the Ene|my; but would be fir&s;t po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his Cannon, and put &s;ome Provi&s;ion <MILESTONE N="50"> into the Ca&s;tle; which he accompli&s;hed without any oppo&s;ition.</P>

King's advance, till a Quarter of their Hor&s;e was beaten up. The next Morning, the King put his Army into Battalia; Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who was now declared General, led the Van; and got po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the Heath, on the back &s;ide of the Ca&s;tle; from which a &s;mall Party might have kept him, the entrance into it being very &s;teep, and the way narrower. On that Heath, the King's Army was drawn up about Noon, every one being prepared to Fight; and none of the Enemy appearing, they marched by the Ca&s;tle over the River by a Mill, and two Fords below it, without any oppo&s;ition; and thence drew into the large Field be|tween <HI>Speen</HI> and <HI>Newbury;</HI> which was thought a good place to expect <MILESTONE N="10"> the Enemy; who, in the mean time, had drawn a great Body of their Hor&s;e and Foot into the other Field toward <HI>Shaw,</HI> and had made Brea&s;t|works and Batteries on the back &s;ide of <HI>Newbury;</HI> which Town they re&s;olv'd to keep, and &s;tand upon the defen&s;ive, as the King had done before; pre&s;uming, that they now having the warmer lodging, might better attack the King after his Men had lain a night or two in the Fields; it being now the Month of <HI>November,</HI> but fair for that Sea&s;on. Some light Skirmi&s;hes pa&s;&s;ed between the Hor&s;e, but when the King &s;aw upon what di&s;advantages he mu&s;t force them to Fight, he called his Council together; who were unanimous in opinion, <Q>&startq;that &s;ince he had <MILESTONE N="$0"> reliev'd the Ca&s;tle, and put &s;ufficient Provi&s;ions into it, and that it was in his power to draw off his Ordnance and Ammunition from thence, he had done his bu&s;ine&s;s; and if any honour had been lo&s;t the other day, it was regain'd now, by his having pa&s;&s;ed his Army over the River in the face of Theirs, and offer'd them Battle; which they&endq; dur&s;t not accept.</Q> Upon which the King re&s;olv'd to attempt them no farther, but gave Orders to retire in their view, with Drums Beating and Trumpets Sounding, the &s;ame way he came over the River. So the King lay that night at <HI>Donnington-</HI>Ca&s;tle, and all the Army about him.</P>
<P>THE King had not yet done all he meant to do, before he took up his Winter Quarters; and was willing, that the Enemy &s;hould have an opportunity to Fight with him, if they de&s;ired it: and therefore, on the <HI>Sunday</HI> morning the tenth of <HI>November,</HI> his Maje&s;ty marched with all his Cannon and Ammunition over the Heath from <HI>Donningion,</HI> over a fair Campagne, to <HI>Lamborne;</HI> in which march, &s;ome of the Enemies Hor&s;e attempted his Rear, but were repul&s;ed with lo&s;s; many being $lain, and &s;ome taken Pri&s;oners. There the King Quarter'd that night, and the next day, to refre&s;h his Men, for the ill lodging they had en|dured at <HI>Donnington;</HI> having &s;ent &s;ome Per&s;ons of great Reputation $nd Intere&s;t to <HI>Marlborough,</HI> to make large provi&s;ions for Him, and his Army. And then, &s;ince he heard the Enemy lay &s;till at <HI>Newbury,</HI> he marched to <HI>Marlborough;</HI> where he found all things to his wi&s;h. His $eart was &s;et upon the relief of <HI>Ba&s;ing,</HI> which was now again di&s;tre&s;s'd; $he Enemy having, as is &s;aid before, begirt it clo&s;ely from the time that <HI>$age</HI> had reliev'd it. He had a great mind to do it with his whole Ar|$y; that thereby he might draw the Enemy to a Battle: <Q>but, upon $ll Debate, it was concluded, &startq;&endq;that the &s;afe&s;t way would be to do it by a &s;trong Party;</Q> that one thou&s;and Hor&s;e &s;hould be drawn out, every one of which &s;hould carry before him a Bag of Corn, or other Provi|&s;ions, and march &s;o as to be at <HI>Ba&s;ing-</HI>Hou&s;e the next morning after they parted from the Army; and then every Trooper was to ca&s;t down his Bag, and to make their retreat as well as they might: and Colonel <HI>$age,</HI> who had &s;o good &s;ucce&s;s before, was appointed to Command this

Party; which he chearfully undertook to do. The better to effect it, <HI>Hungerford</HI> was thought the fitter place to Quarter with the Army, and from thence to di&s;patch that Party: &s;o his Maje&s;ty marched back to <HI>Hungerford,</HI> which was half way to <HI>Newbury:</HI> the Enemy was in mean time marched from thence to <HI>Ba&s;ing;</HI> which, they thought, would, upon the &s;ight of their whole Army, pre&s;ently have yielded; but find|ing the Marquis &s;till ob&s;tinate to Defend it, they were weary of the Win|ter War, and &s;o retired all their force from thence, and quitted the Siege the very day before <HI>Gage</HI> came thither; &s;o that he ea&s;ily deliver'd his Provi&s;ions, and retired to the King without any Inconvenience. His Maje&s;ty then marched to <HI>Farrington,</HI> with &s;ome hope to have &s;urpri&s;ed <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>Abingdon</HI> in his way; but he found it too well provided; and &s;o after he had con&s;ider'd where to Quarter his Hor&s;e, which had formerly had their head Quarter at <HI>Abingdon,</HI> and tho&s;e places which were now un|der the power of that Governour, he return'd to <HI>Oxford;</HI> where he ar|riv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|turns to</HI> Ox|ford.</NOTE> to the univer&s;al joy, on the three and twentieth of <HI>November;</HI> a Sea&s;on of the year fit for all the Troops to be in their Winter Quarters.</P>
<P>THE King was exceedingly plea&s;ed, to find how much the Fortifica|tions there had been advanced by the care and diligence of the Lords; and was very gracious in his acknowledgement of it to them. And the <MILESTONE N="20"> Governour S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton,</HI> having, &s;ome Months before, in the Ma|naging his Hor&s;e in the Fields, cau&s;ed him to fall, had in the fall broken his own Leg, and &s;hortly after, been compell'd to cut it off; &s;o that, if he recover'd at all, which was very doubtful, he could not be fit for any active Service; his Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd to confer that Government upon another. Of which re&s;olution, with all the circum&s;tances of grace and favour, and &s;ending him a Warrant for one thou&s;and pounds a year Pen&s;ion for his Life, he gave him notice; and then, to the mo&s;t general &s;atisfaction of all Men, he conferr'd that Government upon Colonel <HI>Gage;</HI> whom he had before Knighted. S^r <HI>Arthur A&s;ton</HI> was &s;o much <MILESTONE N="30"> di&s;plea&s;ed with his Succe&s;&s;or, that he be&s;ought the King to confer that Charge upon any other Per&s;on; and when he found that his Maje&s;ty would not change his purpo&s;e, he &s;ent to &s;ome Lords to come to him, who he thought were mo&s;t Zealous in Religion, and de&s;ired them to tell the King from him, <Q>&startq;that though he was him&s;elf a Roman Catholick, he had been very careful to give no &s;candal to his Maje&s;ties Prote&s;tant Subjects; and could not but inform him, that <HI>Gage</HI> was the mo&s;t Je|&s;uited Papi&s;t alive; that he had a Je&s;uit who liv'd with him; and that he was pre&s;ent at all the Sermons among the Catholicks; which he&endq; believ'd would be very much to his Maje&s;ties di&s;&s;ervice.</Q> So much his Pa&s;&s;ion and Animo&s;ity over-ruled his Con&s;cience. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P><Q>THE King liked the choice he had made; and only advi&s;ed the new Governour, by one of his Friends, &startq;to have &s;o much di&s;cretion in his Carriage, that there might be no notice taken of the Exerci&s;e of his&endq; Religion;</Q> to which animadver&s;ion he An&s;wer'd, <Q>&startq;that he never had di&s;&s;embled his Religion, nor ever would; but that he had been &s;o wary in the Exerci&s;e of it, that he knew there could be no Witne&s;s produced, who had ever &s;een him at Ma&s;s in <HI>Oxford;</HI> though he heard Ma&s;s every day; and that he had never been but once at a Sermon; which was at the Lodging of S^r <HI>Arthur</HI>'s Daughter; to which he had been invited&endq; <MILESTONE N="5$"> with great importunity;</Q> and believ'd now that it was to entrap him.

<P>THOUGH the King's condition was now much better, than, in the be|ginning of the Summer, he had rea&s;on to expect (he had broken, and de|feated two Armies of the Parliament, and return'd into his Winter Quar|ter <MILESTONE N="10"> with advantage, and rather with an encrea&s;e than diminution of his Forces) yet his nece&s;&s;ities were &s;till the &s;ame, and the Fountains dryed up from whence he might expect Relief; his Quarters &s;horten'd, and le&s;&s;en'd by the Lo&s;s of the whole North: for after the Battle of <HI>York,</HI> the <HI>Scots</HI> return'd to Reduce <HI>Newca&s;tle;</HI> which they had already done; and all other Garri&s;ons which had held out for the King and when that Work &s;hould be Throughly and Sufficiently done, it mu&s;t be expected that Army &s;hould again move South-ward, and take &s;uch other Places, as the Parliament &s;hould not be at lei&s;ure to look after them&s;elves. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THE King's Army was le&s;s united than ever; the old General was &s;et <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Temper of the Army, and Court at this time.</NOTE> a&s;ide, and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> put into the Command, which was no popu|lar Change: for the other was known to be an Officer of great Experi|ence, and had committed no Over&s;ights in his Conduct; was willing to hear every thing Debated, and allways concurr'd with the mo&s;t rea&s;onable Opinion; and though he was not of many words, and was not quick in hearing, yet upon any Action he was Sprightly, and Commanded well. The Prince was rough, and pa&s;&s;ionate, and lov'd not Debate; lik'd what was propos'd, as he lik'd the Per&s;ons who propos'd it; and was &s;o great an Enemy to <HI>Digby</HI> and <HI>Colepepper,</HI> who were only pre&s;ent in Debates <MILESTONE N="30"> of the War with the Officers, that he cro&s;&s;ed all they Propos'd. The truth is, all the Army had been di&s;pos'd, from the fir&s;t rai&s;ing it, to a Neglect and Contempt of the Council; and the King him&s;elf had not been Solli|citous enough to pre&s;erve the Re&s;pect due to it; in which he le&s;&s;en'd his own Dignity.</P>
<P>GORING, who was now General of the Hor&s;e, was no more gracious to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> than <HI>Wilmot</HI> had been; had all the others faults, and wanted his regularity, and pre&s;erving his re&s;pect with the Officers. <HI>Wil|mot</HI> lov'd Debauchery, but &s;hut it out from his bu&s;ine&s;s; never neglected That, and rarely mi&s;carried in it. <HI>Goring</HI> had much a better Under&s;tand|ing, <MILESTONE N="$0"> and a &s;harper Wit (except in the very exerci&s;e of Debauchery, and then the other was in&s;pir'd) a much keener Courage, and pre&s;entne&s;s of Mind in danger: <HI>Wilmot</HI> di&s;cern'd it farther off, and becau&s;e he could not behave him&s;elf &s;o well in it, commonly prevented, or warily declin'd it; and never drank when he was within di&s;tance of an Enemy: <HI>Goring</HI> was not able to re&s;i&s;t the temptation, when he was in the middle of them, nor would decline it to obtain a Victory: as, in one of tho&s;e fits, he had &s;uffer'd the Hor&s;e to e&s;cape out of <HI>Cornwal;</HI> and the mo&s;t &s;ignal mi&s;|fortunes of his life in War, had their ri&s;e from that uncontroulable li|cence.

<P>THE Court was not much better di&s;pos'd than the Army; they wh$ had no Preferment, were angry with tho&s;e who had; and thought they had not de&s;erv'd &s;o well as them&s;elves: they who were envied, found no &s;atisfaction or delight in what they were envied for, being poor and nece&s;|&s;itous, and the more &s;en&s;ible of their being &s;o, by the Titles they had receiv'd upon their own violent Importunity. So that the King was without any joy in the Favours he had conferr'd, and yet was not the le&s;s Sollicited to grant more to others of the &s;ame kind; who, he fore|&s;aw, would be no better pleas'd than the re&s;t: and the plea&s;ing one Man this way, di&s;pleas'd one hundred; as his creating the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> at this time, and making him a Baron (who in truth had &s;erv'd him with great abilities; and, though he did imprudently in de&s;iring it, did de|&s;erve it) did much di&s;&s;atisfy both the Court, and the Army; to neither of which he was in any degree gracious, by his having no ornament o$ Education, to make Men the more propitious to his parts of Nature and di&s;pos'd many others to be very importunate to receive the &s;ame obligation.</P>
<P>THERE had been another Coun&s;el enter'd upon, and concluded with great Deliberation and Wi&s;dom, which turn'd at this time to his Ma|je&s;ties di&s;advantage; which was the Ce&s;&s;ation in <HI>Ireland;</HI> enter'd into as hath been &s;aid before, with all the rea&s;on imaginable, and in hope, to have made a good Peace there, and &s;o to have had the Power of that united Kingdom, to have a&s;&s;i&s;ted to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Rebellion in this. But now, as all the Supplies he had receiv'd from thence upon the Ce&s;&s;ation, had been already de&s;troy'd without any benefit to the King &s;o his Maje&s;ty found, that he &s;hould not be able to make a Peace there and then the Government there would be in the wor&s;e condition by be|ing depriv'd of &s;o many good Officers, and Soldiers, upon the conclu&s;ion of the Ce&s;&s;ation. There had been Commi&s;&s;ioners from that time &s;en$ over to the King from the Confederate Roman Catholicks, to treat $ Peace; the Lord Lieutenant, and Council, had &s;ent likewi&s;e Commi&s;+&s;ioners to inform the King of all things nece&s;&s;ary to be con&s;ider'd in the Treaty; and the Parliament which was then &s;itting in <HI>Ireland,</HI> had &s;en$ likewi&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners, in the Name of the Prote&s;tants in that King+dom, to prevent the making any Peace; and with a Petition to di&s;&s;olv$ the Ce&s;&s;ation that had been made.</P>

<P><Q>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners from the Prote&s;tants demanded, &startq;that the Ce&s;|&s;ation might be Di&s;&s;olv'd, and the War carried on with the utmo&s;t Ri|gour, according to the Act of Parliament that had been made in the <MILESTONE N="20"> beginning of the Rebellion; and that no Peace might be made on any&endq; Conditions.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King demanded of the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> &startq;whether they believ'd it could be in his Power, if it were agreeable to his Con&s;cience, to grant them their Demands? and whether he mu&s;t not thereby purcha&s;e <HI>Ireland</HI> with&endq; the lo&s;s of <HI>England</HI> and <HI>Scotland?</HI></Q> There were among them &s;ome &s;o|ber Men, <Q>who confe&s;&s;ed &startq;that as his Maje&s;ties Affairs then &s;tood, they believ'd he could not grant it; and they hoped, that their General A&s;|&s;embly would, when they &s;hould be inform'd of the truth of his Ma|&s;ties <MILESTONE N="30"> condition, which was not known to them, be per&s;waded to depart from &s;ome of their Demands; but that, for the pre&s;ent, they had not&endq; Authority to recede from any one Propo&s;ition.</Q></P>
<P>THE King then asked the Commi&s;&s;ioners who had been &s;ent over by the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> Lieutenant of the Kingdom, <Q>&startq;which Forces they thought to be the &s;tronger, the King's Army, or that of the Re|bels?&endq;</Q> <Q>they confe&s;&s;ed &startq;the Rebels to be much &s;uperior in power, and&endq; that they were po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of more than three parts of the Kingdom.</Q> The King then asked them, <Q>&startq;whether they thought it probable, now they found them&s;elves to be the Stronger, that the Rebels would be per&s;waded to yeild to &s;o di&s;advantagious terms, as they propos'd, and to <MILESTONE N="40"> be &s;o wholely at the Mercy of tho&s;e whom they had &s;o much provoked? and if they could be &s;o di&s;po&s;ed, whether they believ'd that they were able, though they &s;hould be willing, to &s;ell all they have in <HI>Ireland</HI> to&endq; pay the Damages which had been &s;u&s;tain'd by the War?</Q> The Commi&s;|&s;ioners acknowledged, <Q>&startq;that they thought the la&s;t impo&s;&s;ible; and that there might be a mitigation in that particular; but for the former, they dur&s;t not advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty to recede at all; for that there could be no other &s;ecurity for the Prote&s;tants in that Kingdom, but by leaving the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> without any capacity, or ability to trouble them: for their per|fidiou&s;ne&s;s <MILESTONE N="$0"> was &s;uch, that they could not be tru&s;ted; and therefore they mu&s;t be put into &s;uch a condition, by being totally Di&s;arm'd, that they &s;hould not be able to do any mi&s;chief; or that all the Prote&s;tants

<P>THE King then &s;ent for the Commi&s;&s;ioners from the Parliament, on the behalf of the Prote&s;tants, and asked them, <Q>&startq;whether they were ready, if the Ce&s;&s;ation were expir'd, to renew the War, and to pro&s;ecute it&endq; hopefully, to the reduction or &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Iri&s;h?</HI></Q> They an&s;wer'd very clearly, <Q>&startq;that in the State they were in, they could not carry on the War, or defend them&s;elves again&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> who were much Su|perior to them in Power; but if his Maje&s;ty would recruit his Army and &s;end over Money, and Armes, and Ammunition, with Shipping, they made no doubt, but with Gods ble&s;&s;ing, they &s;hould be able &s;hortly t$&endq; reduce them, and drive them out of the Kingdom.</Q> The King then ask+ed them, <Q>&startq;whether they did in truth think, that his Maje&s;ty was able to &s;end them &s;uch &s;upplies, as they &s;tood in need of? or whether they did not, in their Con&s;ciences, know, that he was not able to &s;end the$&endq; any part of it, and &s;tood in want of all for his own &s;upport?</Q> They an+&s;wered, <Q>&startq;that they hoped he would make a Peace with the Parlia+ment, and would then be able to &s;end over &s;uch A&s;&s;i&s;tance to <HI>Ireland&endq;</HI> as would quickly &s;ettle that Kingdom.</Q></P>
<P>BUT after all the&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, his Maje&s;ty prevail'd not with any o$ them to depart from the mo&s;t unrea&s;onable of all their Demands; where upon he di&s;mi&s;&s;ed them; <Q>and told the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> &startq;it had been in their Powe$ &s;o far to have obliged him, that he might hereafter have thought him &s;elf bound to have gratified them in &s;ome particulars, which were no now &s;ea&s;onable to have been done; but they would repent this thei$ &s;en&s;le&s;s perver&s;ne&s;s, when it would be too late, and when they foun$ them&s;elves under a Power that would de&s;troy them, and make then&endq; cea&s;e to be a Nation.</Q></P>
<P>SO they all left <HI>Oxford;</HI> and his Maje&s;ty, notwith&s;tanding all this re+&s;olution, not to depart from any thing, that might in any degree be pre+judicial to the Prote&s;tant Intere&s;t in that Kingdom, found that he &s;uffer'$ under no reproach more in <HI>England,</HI> than by having made that Ce&s;&s;a+tian: &s;o wonderfully unrea&s;onable was the generality of the Nation then by the ab&s;urd imputation of his Maje&s;ties favouring the <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI></P>
<P>THE &s;treights in which the King now was, brought him to &s;ome re|flections he had never made before; and the con&s;iderations of what might probably be the event of the next Summer, di&s;posed him to inclinations which were very contrary to what he had ever before entertain'd. His three younger Children were taken from the Governe&s;s in who&s;e hands he had put them, and were not only in the Parliament Quarters, but ex+pre&s;sly by their Order, put into the Cu&s;tody of One in whom the King could have the le&s;s confidence, becau&s;e it was One in whom the Parlia+ment confided &s;o much. He had with him the Prince, and the Duke o$ <HI>York,</HI> both young; and he had no re&s;olution more fixed in him, than tha$ the Prince &s;hould never be ab&s;ent from him; which, as hath been touch+ed before, made him le&s;s con&s;ider what Governour, or Servants he pu$ about him; re&s;olving to form his Manners by his own Model. <Q>But now he began to &s;ay &startq;that Him&s;elf and the Prince were too much to ventur$ in one bottom; and that it was now time to unboy him, by putting hi$&endq; into &s;ome action and acquaintance with bu&s;ine&s;s,</Q> out of his own &s;ight but communicated the&s;e thoughts only with the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> the Lor$ <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and was thought t$
<PB N="431" REF="4890">
confer more with the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> upon the Subject, than with ei|ther of the other; but had &s;ome particular thoughts upon which he then conferr'd with no body. There was but one Province in which the Prince could re&s;ide, after he was &s;ever'd from the King; and that was the <HI>We&s;t;</HI> which was yet in a wor&s;e condition than it had been, by the Rebels being po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of <HI>Taunton,</HI> one of the chief Towns in <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire;</HI> and though it was an open, and unfortified place, it was very &s;trong again&s;t the King in the natural di&s;affection of the Inhabitants, which were very numerous; and all the places adjacent of the &s;ame ill Principles; and <HI>Waller</HI> had already &s;ent &s;ome Troops thither to confirm <MILESTONE N="$0"> them in their Rebellious Inclinations, and had him&s;elf a re&s;olution &s;peedily to go thither, with a Body &s;ufficient to form an Army for the reduction of the We&s;t: nor was the de&s;ign improbable to &s;ucceed; for the reputation of the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, upon the recovery of all the North, had &s;haken and terrified all the Kingdom; and the King's Army was the la&s;t Enemy the We&s;t had been acquainted with, and had left no good Name behind it.</P>
<P>To prevent this mi&s;chief, <HI>Goring</HI> (who had now $ade a fa&s;t friend&s;hip with the Lord <HI>Digby;</HI> either of them believing he could deceive the other, and &s;o with equal pa&s;&s;ion embracing the Engagement) was &s;ent with &s;ome Troops to <HI>Salisbury,</HI> from whence he might ea&s;ily prevent any motion of <HI>Waller;</HI> without which, <HI>Taunton</HI> would be in a &s;hort time reduced by the Garri&s;ons the King had in the Country: &s;o that this alteration rather confirm'd, than diverted his Maje&s;ty, in his thoughts of &s;ending the Prince thither: and he begun to publi&s;h his purpo&s;e, and named Coun&s;ellors to be with his Highne&s;s, by who&s;e Advice all things &s;hould be done; his Maje&s;ties purpo&s;e being, in truth, only at that time that the Prince &s;hould go no farther We&s;t than <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> and that there might no jealou&s;ies ari&s;e from this Action (which every Body knew was &s;o far from the King's former purpo&s;e; and it might be imagin'd, that his Highne&s;s would be &s;ent to the Queen his Mother into <HI>France;</HI> which many unrea&s;onably apprehended) the King declared what Council he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Council &s;et|tled for the Prince of</HI> Wales.</NOTE> intended &s;hould be about his Son; the Reputation of whom, he thought, would allay all jealou&s;ies of that kind. He named the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, <Q>and appointed them &startq;to meet frequently at the Prince's Lodging, to con&s;ider with his High|ne&s;s, what preparations &s;hould be made for his Journey, and in what&endq; manner his Family &s;hould be e&s;tabli&s;hed.</Q> There was one Per&s;on more, who of nece&s;&s;ity was to wait on the Prince, the Earl of <HI>Berk-&s;hire,</HI> his Governour; and then his Maje&s;ty found, what wrong Mea&s;ures he had taken in the conferring that Tru&s;t; and lamented his own error to tho&s;e he tru&s;ted; but knew not how to prevent the Inconveniences that might en&s;ue, unle&s;s by applying two remedies, which were not natural, and might have been productive of as great Inconveniences. The one was, to le&s;&s;en the Prince's Reverence, and E&s;teem for his Governour; which was very &s;ufficiently provided for. The other, to leave the Governour without any more Authority, than every one of the Council had; and &s;o much le&s;s, as the Prince had a better e&s;teem of every one of Them, than $e had of Him: and &s;o left him without a Governour, which would have $een a little better, if he had been without the Earl of <HI>Berk-&s;hire</HI> too.</P>
<P>WHEN the King was in this Melancholick po&s;ture, it was a great <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Divi&s;ions a|mong&s;t tho&s;e at</HI> We&s;tmin|&s;ter.</NOTE> $efre&s;hment, and &s;ome advantage to him, to hear that the di&s;order the

Parliament was in, was Superior to His. The Cau&s;e of all the Di&s;tra|ctions in his Court, or Army, proceeded from the extreme poverty and nece&s;&s;ity his Maje&s;ty was in; and a very moderate &s;upply of Money would, in a Moment, have extingui&s;hed all tho&s;e di&s;tempers. But all the Wealth of the Kingdom, for they were well nigh po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of all, could not prevent the &s;ame, and greater di&s;tractions and emulations, from breaking into the whole Government of the Parliament: for all the per&s;onal Animo&s;ities imaginable broke out in their Councils, and in their Armies; and the Hou&s;e of Peers found them&s;elves, upon the mat|ter, excluded from all power, or credit, when they did not concur in all the demands which were made by the Commons.</P>
<P>THAT violent Party, which had at fir&s;t cozen'd the re&s;t into the War, and afterwards ob&s;tructed all the Approaches towards Peace, found now that they had fini&s;hed as much of their work, as the tools which they had wrought with, could be applied to; and what remain'd to be done, mu&s;t be di&s;patched by new Workmen. They had been long un&s;atisfied with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and He as much with Them; both being more &s;ollicitous to &s;uppre&s;s the other, than to de&s;troy the King. They bore the lo&s;s and di&s;honour he had &s;u&s;tain'd in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> very well; and would have been glad, that both He and his Army had been quite cut off, in|&s;tead of being di&s;&s;olv'd; for mo&s;t of his Officers and Soldiers, were cor|rupted in their Affections towards them; and de&s;ired nothing but Peace &s;o that they re&s;olv'd never more to tru&s;t, or employ any of them. But that which troubled them more, was, that their beloved Earl of <HI>Man+che&s;ter,</HI> upon whom they depended as a fa&s;t Friend, by whom they might in&s;en&s;ibly have dive&s;ted the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> of all inconvenient Au+thority in the Army, appear'd now as unapplicable to their purpo&s;es a$ the other; and there was a breach fallen out between Him and <HI>Olive Cromwell,</HI> which was irreconcilable, and had brought &s;ome Coun&s;el upon the Stage, before they were ripe.</P>
<P><Q>CROMWELL accu&s;ed the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> &startq;of having betraye$ the Parliament out of Cowardice; for that he might, at the King la&s;t being at <HI>Newbury,</HI> when he drew off his Cannon, very ea&s;ily have defeated his whole Army, if he would have permitted it to have been engaged: that he went to him, and &s;hew'd him evidently how might be done; and de&s;ired him that he would give him leave, wit his own Brigade of Hor&s;e, to Charge the King's Army in their Retrea$ and the Earl, with the re&s;t of his Army, might look on, and do as $ &s;hould think fit; but that the Earl had, notwith&s;tanding all import+nity u&s;ed by him and other Officers, po&s;itively and ob&s;tinately refu&s;$ to permit him; giving no other rea&s;on, but that, he &s;aid, if they d$ engage, and overthrow the King's Army, the King would allways ha$$ another Army to keep up the War; but if that Army which he com+manded, &s;hould be overthrown, before the other under the Earl <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> &s;hould be reinforced, there would be an end of their pretence and they &s;hould be all Rebels, and Traytors, and executed and forfeit&endq; by the Law.</Q></P>
<P>THIS pronunciation what the Law would do again&s;t them, was $e heavily taken by the Parliament, as if the Earl believ'd the Law to again&s;t them, after &s;o many Declarations made by them, <Q>&startq;that the L$$ was on Their &s;ide, and that the King's Armes were taken up agai$$&endq; the Law.</Q> <Q>The Earl confe&s;&s;ed &startq;he had u&s;ed words to that effect, t$ they &s;hould be treated as Traytors, if their Army was defeated, w$$

he did not approve the advice that was given by the Lieutenant Ge|neral; which would have expo&s;ed the Army to greater hazard, than he thought &s;ea&s;onable in that Conjuncture, in the middle of the Win|ter,&endq;</Q> to expo&s;e it to. <Q>He then recriminated <HI>Cromwell,</HI> &startq;that, at an|other time, <HI>Cromwell</HI> di&s;cour&s;ing freely with him of the State of the Kingdom, and propo&s;ing &s;omewhat to be done, the Earl had An&s;wer'd, that the Parliament would never approve it; to which <HI>Cromwell</HI> pre|&s;ently replied, My Lord, if you will &s;tick firm to hone&s;t Men, you &s;hall find your &s;elf in the head of an Army that &s;hall give the Law to King and Parliament; which di&s;cour&s;e, he &s;aid, made great impre&s;&s;ion in him; for he knew the Lieutenant General to be a Man of very deep <MILESTONE N="10"> de&s;igns; and therefore he was the more careful to pre&s;erve an Army,&endq; which he yet thought was very faithful to the Parliament.</Q></P>
<P>THIS di&s;cour&s;e &s;tartled tho&s;e who had allways an aver&s;ion to <HI>Crom|well,</HI> and had ob&s;erv'd the fiercene&s;s of his Nature, and the Language he commonly u&s;ed when there was any mention of Peace; &s;o that they de&s;ired that this matter might be throughly examin'd, and brought to Judgement. But the other &s;ide put all ob&s;tructions i$ the way, and ra|ther cho&s;e to lo&s;e the advantage they had again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> than to have the other matter examin'd; which would unavoidably <MILESTONE N="20"> have made &s;ome di&s;coveries they were not yet ready to produce. How|ever the Animo&s;ities encrea&s;ed, and the Parties appear'd barefaced again&s;t each other; which augmented the di&s;tractions, and divided the City as well as the Parliament; and new opinions &s;tarted up in Religion; which made more &s;ubdivi&s;ions; and new terms and di&s;tinctions were brought into di&s;cour&s;e; and <HI>Fanaticks</HI> were now fir&s;t brought into appellation: which kind of confu&s;ions exceedingly di&s;po&s;ed Men of any &s;ober under|&s;tanding, to wi&s;h for Peace; though none knew how to bring the men|tion of it into the Parliament.</P>
<P>THE <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners were as jealous, and as un&s;atisfied as any <MILESTONE N="$0"> other Party; and found, &s;ince the Battle of <HI>York,</HI> neither their Army, nor Them&s;elves &s;o much con&s;ider'd, as before; nor conditions perform'd towards them with any punctuality. They had long had jealou&s;y of <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and S^r <HI>Henry Vane,</HI> and all that Party; which they &s;aw en|crea&s;ed every day; and grew powerful in the Parliament, in the Coun|cil, and in the City. Their &s;acred Vow and Covenant was mention'd with le&s;s reverence, and re&s;pect, and the Independents, which compre|hended many Sects in Religion, &s;pake publickly again&s;t it; of which Party <HI>Cromwell,</HI> and <HI>Vane,</HI> were the Leaders; with very many of their Clergy Men, who were the mo&s;t popular Preachers, and in the A&s;&s;em|bly of Divines had great Authority: &s;o that the <HI>Scots</HI> plainly perceiv'd, that though they had gone as far towards the de&s;truction of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> as they de&s;ired, they &s;hould never be able to e&s;tabli&s;h their Presbyterian Government; without which they &s;hould lo&s;e all their credit in their own Country, and all their Intere&s;t in <HI>England.</HI> They di&s;cern'd likewi&s;e, that there was a purpo&s;e, if that Party prevail'd, to change the whole Frame of the Government, as well Civil as Eccle&s;ia&s;ti|cal, and to reduce the Monarchy to a Republick; which was as far from the end and purpo&s;e of that Nation, as to re&s;tore Epi&s;copacy. So that they &s;aw no way to prevent the mi&s;chief and confu&s;ion that would fall out, but by a Peace; which they begun heartily to wi&s;h, and to con&s;pire with tho&s;e of that Party which mo&s;t de&s;ired to bring it to pa&s;s; but how to &s;et a Treaty on foot, they knew not.</P>

They who had an inward aver&s;ion from it, and were re|&s;olv'd to prevent it by all po&s;&s;ible means, wrought upon many of the other to believe, <Q>&startq;that they would accept of a Propo&s;ition for a Treaty, if the King de&s;ired it; but that it would be di&s;honourable, and of very pernicious con&s;equence to the Nation, if the Parliament fir&s;t propo&s;ed&endq; it.</Q> So that it &s;eem'd evident, that if any of the Party which did in truth de&s;ire Peace, &s;hould propo&s;e it to the Parliament, it would be re|jected; and rejected upon the point of Honour, by many of tho&s;e who <MILESTONE N="10"> in their hearts prayed for it.</P>
<P>THEY tried their old Friends of the City, who had &s;erv'd their Turns &s;o often, and &s;et &s;ome of them to get hands to a Petition, by which the Parliament &s;hould be moved, <Q>&startq;&endq; to &s;end to the King to Treat of Peace.</Q> But that de&s;ign was no &s;ooner known, but others of an oppo&s;ite Party were appointed to &s;et a counter Petition on foot, <Q>by which they &s;hould &startq;di&s;claim any Con&s;ent to, or Approbation of the other Petition; not&endq; that they did not de&s;ire Peace,</Q> <Q>as much as their Neighbours (no body was yet arriv'd at the impudence to profe&s;s again&s;t Peace) &startq;but that they would not pre&s;ume to move the Parliament in it, becau&s;e they <MILESTONE N="20"> knew, their wi&s;dom knew be&s;t the way to obtain it, and would do&endq; what was nece&s;&s;ary and fit towards it;</Q> to which they wholely left it.</P>
<P>THIS Petition found more Countenance among the Magi&s;trates, the Mayor, and Aldermen; S^r <HI>Henry Vane</HI> having diligently provided, that Men of his own Principles and Inclinations, &s;hould be brought into the Government of the City; of which he &s;aw they &s;hould allways have great need, even in order to keep the Parliament well di&s;po&s;ed. So that they who did in truth de&s;ire any rea&s;onable Peace, found the way to it &s;o difficult, and that it was impo&s;&s;ible to prevail with the two Hou&s;es <MILESTONE N="30"> to propo&s;e it to the King, that they re&s;olv'd, <Q>&startq;it could only ri&s;e from his Maje&s;ty; and to that purpo&s;e they &s;hould all labour with their &s;e|veral Friends at <HI>Oxford,</HI> to incline the King to &s;end a Me&s;&s;age to the Parliament, to offer a Treaty of Peace in any place where they &s;hould appoint; and then they would all run the utmo&s;t hazard before it&endq; &s;hould be rejected.</Q></P>
<P>THE Independent Party (for under that Style and Appellation they now acted, and own'd them&s;elves) which fear'd and abhorr'd all Mo|tions towards Peace, were in as great &s;treights as the other, how to carry on their de&s;igns. They were re&s;olv'd to have no more to do with either <MILESTONE N="4$"> of their Generals, but how to lay them a&s;ide, was the difficulty; e&s;pe|cially the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> who had been &s;o entirely their Founder, that they owed not more to the power and reputation of Parliament, than to His &s;ole Name, and Credit: the being able to rai&s;e an Army, and conducting it to Fight again&s;t the King was purely due to Him, and the effect of His power. And now to put &s;uch an Affront upon him, and to think of another General, mu&s;t appear the highe&s;t Ingratitude, and might provoke the Army it &s;elf, where he was &s;till exceedingly belov'd; and to continue him in that Tru&s;t, was to betray their own de&s;igns, and to render them impracticable. Therefore, till they could find &s;ome ex|pedient to explicate and di&s;intangle them&s;elves out of this Labyrinth, they made no advance towards the recruiting or &s;upplying their Armies, nor to provide for any Winter expedition; only they &s;ent <HI>Waller</HI> out,
<PB N="435" REF="4930">
with &s;uch Troops towards the We&s;t, as they cared not for, and re&s;olv'd to u&s;e their Service no more.</P>
<P>THEY knew not how to propo&s;e the great alterations, they intended, to the Parliament; and of all Men, the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners were not to be tru&s;ted. In the end, they re&s;olv'd to pur&s;ue the Method in which they had been hitherto &s;o &s;ucce&s;sful, and to prepare, and ripen things in the Church, that they might afterwards in due time grow to matu|rity in the Parliament. <Q>They agreed therefore in the Hou&s;es (and in tho&s;e Combinations they were allways unanimous) &startq;that they would&endq; have a &s;olemn Fa&s;t day,</Q> <Q>in which they would <HI>&s;eek God</HI> (which was the new phra&s;e they brought from <HI>Scotland</HI> with their Covenant) &startq;and&endq; <MILESTONE N="$0"> de&s;ire his A&s;&s;i&s;tance,</Q> to lead them out of the perplexities they were in: and they did as readily agree in the nomination of the Preachers who were to perform that exerci&s;e, and who were more tru&s;ted in the deepe&s;t de&s;igns, than mo&s;t of tho&s;e who named them were: for there was now a Schi&s;m among their Clergy, as well as the Laity; and the Indepen|dents were the bolder, and more Political Men.</P>
<P><Q>WHEN the Fa&s;t day came (which was ob&s;erv'd for eight or ten hours together in the Churches) the Preachers prayed &startq;the Parliament might be in&s;pired with tho&s;e thoughts, as might contribute to their Honour and Reputation; and that they might pre&s;erve that opinion the Na|tion <MILESTONE N="$0"> had of their Hone&s;ty and Integrity, and be without any Selfi&s;h&endq; ends, or &s;eeking their own benefit and advantage.</Q> After this prepara|tion by their Prayers, the Preachers, let their Texts be what they would, told them very plainly, <Q>&startq;that it was no wonder there was &s;uch di|vi&s;ion among them in their Coun&s;els, when there was no Union in their hearts: That the Parliament lay under many reproaches, not only among their Enemies, but with their be&s;t Friends; who were the more out of countenance, becau&s;e they found that the a&s;per&s;ions and imputations which their Enemies had laid upon them, were &s;o well <MILESTONE N="$0"> grounded, that they could not wipe them off: That there was as great Pride, as great Ambition, as many private ends, and as little Zeal and Affection for the publick, as they had ever imputed to the Court: That, whil&s;t they pretended, at the publick co&s;t, and out of the Pur&s;es of the poor People, to make a general Reformation, their chief care was to grow great and rich Them&s;elves; and that both the City and Kingdom took notice, with great anxiety of mind, that all the Offices of the Army, and all the profitable Offices of the Kingdom, were in the hands of the Members of the two Hou&s;es of Parliament; who, whil&s;t the Nation grew poor, as it mu&s;t needs do under &s;uch in&s;up|portable <MILESTONE N="$0"> Taxes, grew very rich; and would, in a &s;hort time, get all the Money of the Kingdom into their hands; and that it could not rea&s;onably be expected, that &s;uch Men, who got &s;o much, and en|riched them&s;elves to that degree, by the continuance of the War, would heartily pur&s;ue tho&s;e ways which would put an end to it; the&endq; end whereof mu&s;t put an end to their exorbitant profit.</Q> When they had exaggerated the&s;e reproaches, as pathetically as they could, and the &s;en&s;e the People generally had of the corruption of it, even to a de&s;pair of ever &s;eeing an end of the calamities they &s;u&s;tain'd, or having any pro|&s;pect of that Reformation in Church and State, which they had &s;o often and &s;o &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to effect, <Q>they fell again to their Prayers, &startq;that God would take his own Work into his hand; and if the In&s;tru|ments he had allready imploy'd, were not worthy to bring &s;o glorious

a de&s;ign to a conclu&s;ion, that he would in&s;pire others more fit, who might perfect what was begun, and bring the trouble of the Nation to&endq; a Godly period.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the two Hou&s;es met together, the next day after the&s;e devout <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>After a Fa&s;t day,</HI> Vane <HI>and</HI> Cromwell <HI>propo&s;ed a &s;elf denying Ordi|nance.</HI></NOTE> Animadver&s;ions, there was another Spirit appear'd in the looks of many of them. S^r <HI>Henry Vane</HI> told them, <Q>&startq;if ever God had appear'd to them, it was in the exerci&s;e of Ye&s;terday; and that it appear'd, it proceeded from God, becau&s;e (as he was credibly inform'd by many, who had been Auditors in other Congregations) the &s;ame lamentations, and di|&s;cour&s;es, had been made in all other Churches, as the Godly Preachers had made before Them; which could therefore proceed only from the&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> immediate Spirit of God.</Q> He repeated &s;ome things which had been &s;aid, upon which he was be&s;t prepar'd to enlarge; <Q>and be&s;ought them &startq;to remember their obligations to God, and to their Country; and that they would free them&s;elves from tho&s;e ju&s;t reproaches; which they could do no otherwi&s;e, than by deve&s;ting them&s;elves of all Offices, and Charges, that might bring in the lea&s;t advantage and profit to them|&s;elves; by which only they could make it appear, that they were pub|lick-hearted Men; and as they pay'd all Taxes and Impo&s;itions with the re&s;t of the Nation, &s;o they gave up all their time to their Countries&endq; Service, without any reward or gratuity.</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P><Q>He told them, &startq;that the Reflections of Ye&s;terday, none of which had ever enter'd upon his Spirit before, had rai&s;ed another Reflection in him than had been mention'd; which was, that it had been often taken notice of, and objected by the King Him&s;elf, that the Numbers of the Members of Parliament, who &s;ate in either Hou&s;e, were too few to give reputation to Acts of &s;o great Moment, as were tran&s;acted in their Councils; which, though it was no fault of theirs, who kept their pro|per Stations, but of tho&s;e who had de&s;erted their places, and their tru&s;ts, by being ab&s;ent from the Parliament; yet that, in truth, there <MILESTONE N="3$"> were too many ab&s;ent, though in the Service of the Hou&s;e, and by Their appointment; and if all the Members were obliged to attend the Service of the Parliament, in the Parliament, it would bring great reputation to their Numbers, and the People would pay more reve|rence,&endq;</Q> and yeild a fuller obedience to their Commands: and then con|cluded, <Q>&startq;that he was ready to accu&s;e him&s;elf for one of tho&s;e who gain'd by an Office he had; and though he was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of it before the begin|ning&endq; of the Troubles,</Q> <Q>and owed it not to the favour of the Parliament (for he had been joyn'd with S^r <HI>William Ru&s;&s;el</HI> in the Trea&s;urer-&s;hip of the Navy by the King's Grant) &startq;yet he was ready to lay it down, to be di&s;po&s;ed of by the Parliament; and wi&s;hed, that the profits thereof might&endq; be applied towards the &s;upport of the War.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN the Ice was thus broke, <HI>Oliver Cromwell,</HI> who had not yet ar|rived at the faculty of Speaking with decency and temper, <Q>commend|ed the Preachers &startq;for having dealt plainly and impartially, and told them of their faults, which they had been &s;o unwilling to hear of: that there were many things, upon which he had never reflected before, yet upon revolving what had been &s;aid, he could not but confe&s;s, that all was very true; and till there were a perfect reformation in tho&s;e particulars which had been recommended to them, nothing would pro&s;per that they took in hand: that the Parliament had done very wi&s;ely, in the entrance into the War, to engage many Members of their own in the mo&s;t dangerous parts of it, that the Nation might &s;ee
<PB N="437" REF="4970">
that they did not intend to embark them in perils of War, whil&s;t them|&s;elves &s;ate &s;ecurely at home out of Gun-&s;hot, but would march with them where the danger mo&s;t threatned; and tho&s;e honourable Per&s;ons, who had expo&s;ed them&s;elves this way, had merited &s;o much of their Country, that their memories &s;hould be held in perpetual veneration; and what&s;oever &s;hould be well done after them, would be allways im|puted to their Example: But, that God had &s;o ble&s;&s;ed their Army, that there had grown up with it, and under it, very many excellent Officers, who were fitter for much greater Charges than they were now&endq; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of;</Q> <Q>and de&s;ir'd them &startq;not to be terrifi'd with an imagination, <MILESTONE N="10"> that if the highe&s;t Offices were vacant, they &s;hould not be able to put as fit Men into them; for, be&s;ides that it was not good to put &s;o much tru&s;t in any arm of fle&s;h, as to think &s;uch a Cau&s;e as This depended upon any one Man, he did take upon him to a&s;&s;ure them, that they had Officers in their Army, who were fit to be Generals in any Enter|pri&s;e&endq; in Chri&s;tendom.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE &s;aid &startq;he thought nothing &s;o nece&s;&s;ary as to purge, and vindicate&endq; the Parliament,</Q> from the partiality towards their own Members; and made a proffer to lay down his Commi&s;&s;ion of Command in the Army; and de&s;ir'd, <Q>&startq;that an Ordinance might be prepar'd, by which it might be made unlawfull, for any Member of either Hou&s;e of Parliament, to <MILESTONE N="20"> hold any Office or Command in the Army, or any Place or Employ|ment&endq; in the State;</Q> <Q>and &s;o concluded with an enlargement upon &startq;the Vices, and Corruptions, which were gotten into the Army; the pro|phanene&s;s, and impiety, and ab&s;ence of all Religion; the drinking and gaming, and all manner of Licence, and Lazine&s;s; and &s;aid plainly, that till the whole Army were new Modell'd, and Govern'd under a &s;tricter di&s;cipline, they mu&s;t not expect any notable Succe&s;s in any thing&endq; they went about.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THIS debate ended in appointing a Committee, &startq;to prepare an Or|dinance&endq; for the Exclu&s;ion of all Members from the Tru&s;ts afore&s;aid;</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"> which took up much debate, and depended very long before it was brought to a conclu&s;ion; and in the end was call'd the <HI>Self-denying Ordi|nance;</HI> the driving on of which, exceedingly encrea&s;ed the inclination of the other Party to Peace; which they did now fore&s;ee would only prevent their own ruines, in that of the Kingdom.</P>
<P>ADVICE came from &s;o many &s;everal hands to <HI>Oxford,</HI> that the King &s;hould &s;end a Me&s;&s;age to the Hou&s;es for Peace, with an A&s;&s;urance that it would not be rejected, that his Maje&s;ty (who &s;till apprehended as great a divi&s;ion among his own Friends upon the conditions of Peace, out of the univer&s;al wearine&s;s of the War, as he di&s;cern'd there was among his <MILESTONE N="40"> Enemies upon the Emulation in Command, or differences in Religion) entered upon the con&s;ideration how to bring it to pa&s;s. The Members of Parliament were &s;till &s;itting at <HI>Oxford:</HI> but they at <HI>London</HI> who were mo&s;t de&s;irous of Peace, had given warning to avoid that Rock; and that their Names &s;hould never be mention'd; which would have procured an Union between the mo&s;t irreconcileable Parties, in throwing out &s;uch Overtures. On the other &s;ide the &s;ending a bare Me&s;&s;age, by a Trumpet, was not probably like to produce any other effect, than an in&s;olent An|&s;wer in the &s;ame way, or no an&s;wer at all, as his two or three la&s;t Me&s;|&s;ages had done.</P>
<P>IN conclu&s;ion, the King re&s;olv'd that there &s;hould be a &s;hort Me&s;&s;age drawn; in which, <Q>&startq;the continuance of the War, and the mi&s;chiefs it
<PB N="438" REF="4980">
brought upon the Kingdom, &s;hould be lamented; and his de&s;ire expre&s;s'd, that &s;ome rea&s;onable conditions of Peace might be thought upon; a&s;&s;ur|ing them that his Maje&s;ty would be willing to con&s;ent to any thing, that&endq; could con&s;i&s;t with his Con&s;cience and Honour.</Q> He re&s;olv'd, that he would &s;end this Me&s;&s;age by &s;ome Per&s;ons of Condition; who might, upon conference with their Friends, be able to make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ion; at lea&s;t di&s;cover what might be rea&s;onably expected. And if the Parlia|ment &s;hould refu&s;e to grant a Safe conduct for &s;uch Me&s;&s;engers, it might well be pre&s;um'd, what reception the Me&s;&s;age it &s;elf was like to find. The Per&s;ons he re&s;olv'd to &s;end, were the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton;</HI> both of unblemi&s;hed Honour, and of general Reputa|tion <MILESTONE N="1$"> in the Kingdom. So a Trumpet was &s;ent to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> for a &s;afe-guard, or Pa&s;s, to tho&s;e two Lords; to the end they might deliver a Me&s;&s;age from the King to the two Hou&s;es concerning a Treaty of Peace. To which the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> only an&s;werd, <Q>&startq;that he would ac|quaint&endq; the Hou&s;es with it,</Q> and return their An&s;wer; and &s;o di&s;mi&s;&s;ed the Trumpet.</P>
<P>THE King had now done His part; and the re&s;t was to be perfected there. They, who were re&s;olved never to admit a Peace, though they could not &s;till prevent a Treaty, thought they had advantage enough to&punc; object again&s;t this unu&s;ual Me&s;&s;age: <Q>&startq;If the Me&s;&s;age it &s;elf had been &s;ent, they might have judged, whether it had been like to be attended with good Succe&s;s, and &s;o might have accepted a Treaty, if they had ap|proved of it; but this &s;ending of Me&s;&s;engers before they knew what they would bring, was an invention to begin a Treaty before they ad|mitted it; and to &s;end Enemies into their Quarters, with Authority&endq; to &s;catter their Poy&s;on abroad:</Q> and therefore, with great pa&s;&s;ion, they pre&s;&s;ed, <Q>&startq;&endq; that no &s;uch Pa&s;s &s;hould be &s;ent. On the other hand it was, with equal pa&s;&s;ion, alledged,</Q> <Q>&startq;that the refu&s;al of the Safe conduct was a total rejection of Peace, before they under&s;tood upon what terms it would be offer'd; which the People would take very ill from them; and conclude that the War mu&s;t continue for ever; they therefore wi&s;hed that a Safe-guard might be &s;ent without delay, and that they would have a better opinion of their Friends, than to imagine that the Pre&s;ence, or Power of two Men how con&s;iderable &s;oever, would be&endq; able to corrupt,</Q> or pervert their Affections from the Parliament.</P>
<P>IN this opinion the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners likewi&s;e concurr'd; &s;o that the other party found it nece&s;&s;ary to con&s;ent, and the Safe Conduct, af|ter many debates, was &s;ent accordingly. But that they might not &s;eem to their Friends abroad, to be overpower'd; they revenged them&s;elves in pur&s;uing the di&s;patch of their <HI>Self-denying Ordinance</HI> with great vehe|mence; <Q>and becau&s;e the effect of that was manife&s;tly that they &s;hould be without a General, it was already propo&s;ed &startq;&endq;that S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI></Q> (who had behaved him&s;elf &s;o &s;ignally in their Service, in the defeat of <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> Thomas Fairfax <HI>is pro|po&s;ed in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons to be made their General.</HI></NOTE> Colonel <HI>Bella&s;is,</HI> and taking him Pri&s;oner, which gave them their fir&s;t footing in <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> from their being &s;hut up and be&s;ieged in <HI>Hull;</HI> in the overthrow of the Lord <HI>Byron,</HI> and taking all the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Regiments&punc; and la&s;tly in the late Battle at <HI>York,</HI> where he had turned the fortune of the day, <Q>when the <HI>Scots</HI> Army was routed and their General fled) &startq;might&endq; now be made their General;</Q> for which <HI>Oliver Cromwell</HI> a&s;&s;ured them he was very equal. In the di&s;cour&s;es upon this Subject (which found al oppo&s;ition) as the Service of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> was much magnified, and his merit extolled, by tho&s;e who de&s;ired to have no other General, &s;o i$

was undervalued, and depre&s;&s;ed, with &s;ome bitterne&s;s and contumely, by tho&s;e who believ'd that all they could do would be to no purpo&s;e, if He were not totally excluded from any power.</P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of <HI>December,</HI> the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> and the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Duke of</HI> Richmond <HI>and the Earl of</HI> Southam|pton <HI>&s;ent to</HI> London <HI>with a Me&s;&s;age for a Treaty.</HI></NOTE> Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> upon their Pa&s;s, went from <HI>Oxford</HI> to <HI>London;</HI> where they were advi&s;ed not to go much abroad, le&s;t the People &s;hould be apt to do them injury; and very few had the Courage to come to them, except with great privacy. Only the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, as Men in Soveraign Authority, and Independent upon the Parliament, made no &s;cruple of vi&s;iting them, and being vi&s;ited by them. The Hou&s;es did not pre&s;ently agree upon the manner of their reception, how they &s;hould deliver their Me&s;&s;age; in which there had been before no difficulty, whil&s;t the War was carried on only by the Authority of the Parliament. Heretofore the Me&s;&s;age being deliver'd to either Hou&s;e, was quickly communicated to the other; but now the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners made a third E&s;tate, and the Me&s;&s;age was directed to Them as well as to the Hou&s;es. In the end it was re&s;olved, <Q>&startq;that there &s;hould be a Conference between the two Hou&s;es in the Painted Chamber; at which the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould be pre&s;ent, and &s;it on one &s;ide of the Table; and&endq; that the upper end of it &s;hould be kept for the King's Me&s;&s;engers:</Q> where there was a Seat provided for them, all the re&s;t being bare, and expect|ing that They would be &s;o too: for though the Lords u&s;ed to be cover'd whil&s;t the Commons were bare, yet the Commons would not be bare before the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners; and &s;o None were cover'd. But a&s;&s;oon as the two Lords came thither, they cover'd, to the trouble of the other; but, being pre&s;ently to &s;peak, they were quickly freed from that Eye-&s;ore.</P>
<P>THE two Lords u&s;ed very few words, in letting them know the King's great Inclinations to Peace; and deliver'd and read their Me&s;&s;age to that purpo&s;e; <Q>which was received by the Lords without any other expre&s;|&s;ions than &startq;&endq; that they &s;hould report it to the Hou&s;es;</Q> and &s;o the meet|ing broke up: and then many of the Lords, and &s;ome of the Commons, pa&s;&s;ed &s;ome Compliments and Ceremony to the two Lords, according to the acquaintance they had with them, and found opportunities to &s;ee them in private, or to &s;end confiding Per&s;ons to them. By which means, they found there were great Divi&s;ions among them, and upon Points that would admit no reconciliation: and therefore they believed that there would be a Treaty of Peace; but they could not make any &s;uch Gue&s;s of the moderation of the conditions of the Peace, as to conclude that it would be with effect. For they that mo&s;t de&s;ired the Peace, and would have been glad to have had it upon any Terms, dur&s;t not own that they wi&s;hed it, but upon the highe&s;t terms of honour, and &s;ecurity for the Parliament; which could neither be &s;ecure, nor honourable for the King. They di&s;cover'd, that they who did heartily wi&s;h the Peace, did intend to promote a Treaty between Per&s;ons named by the King, and Per&s;ons named by the Parliament, to meet at &s;ome third Place, and not to &s;end Commi&s;&s;ioners to <HI>Oxford</HI> to Treat with the King him&s;elf; which they had already found to be ineffectual, and not more likely now to produce a better end: whereas they did believe, or &s;eemed to believe, that how unrea&s;onable &s;oever the Propo&s;itions &s;hould be, upon which they Treat|ed, they would, by yeilding to &s;ome things, when they refu&s;ed others, &s;ooner prevail with the Hou&s;es to mollifie their demands, than at fir&s;t to reform them.</P>
<P>THIS Method was not ungrateful to the two Lords; who had the
<PB N="440" REF="5010">
&s;ame conceptions, that, if &s;ober Men were named for Commi&s;&s;ioners, &s;omewhat would re&s;ult from the freedom of their Communication. And the Duke of <HI>Richmond</HI> &s;ent his Secretary <HI>Web</HI> expre&s;sly to <HI>Oxford,</HI> to know the King's plea&s;ure, <Q>&startq;whether, if a third place were propo&s;ed&endq; for Commi&s;&s;ioners on both &s;ides to meet,</Q> they &s;hould con&s;ent to it? which his Maje&s;ty (though he had no mind to tru&s;t others, but where him&s;elf was pre&s;ent) was per&s;waded to approve. But all this was but di&s;cour&s;e, and private wi&s;hes: for it was never brought into Debate; and it was told them very plainly, <Q>&startq;that, as long as they &s;tay'd in Town, the Hou&s;es would never &s;o much as confer upon the Subject of their Me&s;&s;age; becau&s;e they found it would be matter of great Debate, and &s;pend much time; during which they did not de&s;ire their Company,&endq; nor to be troubled with their Infu&s;ions.</Q> And therefore, a&s;&s;oon as they had receiv'd the King's Me&s;&s;age, they proceeded upon their Trial of the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> before both Hou&s;es of Parliament, upon an Impeachment of High Trea&s;on, re&s;olving likewi&s;e to give that evidence to the People, of what inclination they had to make a Peace with the King. The two Lords, ob&s;erving this affected delay in the bu&s;ine&s;s they were &s;ent about, and being advi&s;ed by their Friends not to &s;tay longer, but to expect the determination to be &s;ent to <HI>Oxford,</HI> return'd to the King, with &s;ome confidence that a Treaty would be con&s;ented to; and that it would be at &s;ome third place, and not at <HI>Oxford,</HI> and le&s;s at <HI>London,</HI> by Commi&s;&s;ioners which &s;hould be agreed on by both &s;ides. But they brought an expre&s;s de&s;ire, and even a condition to the King, from all tho&s;e with whom they had conferr'd, and who were the chief Per&s;ons who advanced the Treaty, <Q>&startq;that, if that which they labour'd for, &s;hould be yielded to by the Parliament, his Maje&s;ty would not&endq; Name a Per&s;on (whom they mention'd to the King)</Q> <Q>&startq;for one of his Commi&s;&s;ioners; for that he was &s;o odious, that they would ab&s;olutely decline the Treaty, before they would admit Him to be one of the&endq; Treaters.</Q></P>
<P>IT was, as is &s;aid before, a very &s;ad Omen to the Treaty, that, after <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Trial of the Arch-Bi|&s;hop of</HI> Can|terbury.</NOTE> they had receiv'd the King's Me&s;&s;age by tho&s;e Noble Lords, and before they return'd any An&s;wer to it, they proceeded in the Trial of the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> who had lain Pri&s;oner in the Tower, from the beginning of the Parliament, about four years, without any pro&s;ecution till this time. Now they brought him to the Barrs of both Hou&s;es&punc; charging him with &s;everal Articles of High Trea&s;on; which, if all tha$ was alledged again&s;t him, had been true, could not have made him guilt$ of Trea&s;on. <Q>They accu&s;ed him &startq;of a de&s;ign to bring in Popery, and o$&endq; having corre&s;pondence with the Pope,</Q> and &s;uch like particulars, as th$ Con&s;ciences of his greate&s;t Enemies ab&s;olv'd him from. No Man was&punc; greater, or abler Enemy to Popery; No Man a more re&s;olute and de+vout Son of the Church of <HI>England.</HI> He was pro&s;ecuted by Lawyers a&s;&s;ign'd to that purpo&s;e, out of tho&s;e, who from their own Antipathy t$ the Church and Bi&s;hops, or from &s;ome di&s;obligations receiv'd from hi$ were &s;ure to bring Pa&s;&s;ion, Animo&s;ity, and Malice enough of their own what evidence &s;oever they had from others. And they did treat hi$ with all the rudene&s;s, reproach, and barbarity imaginable; with which his Judges were not di&s;plea&s;ed.</P>

So that though few excellent Men have ever had fewer Friends to their Per&s;ons, yet all rea&s;onable Men ab&s;olv'd him from any foul crime that the Law could take notice of, and puni&s;h. However, when They had &s;aid all they could again&s;t him, and He all for him&s;elf that need to be &s;aid, and no &s;uch crime appearing, as the Lords, as the Supreme Court of Judicatory, would take upon them to judge him to be worthy of death; they re&s;orted to their Legi&s;lative Power, and by Ordinance <NOTE PLACE="marg">He is con|demn'd by an Ordinance.</NOTE> of Parliament, as they called it, that is by a determination of tho&s;e Mem|bers who &s;ate in the Hou&s;es (whereof in the Hou&s;e of Peers there were not above twelve) they appointed him to be put to death as guilty of High Trea&s;on. The fir&s;t time that two Hou&s;es of Parliament had ever a&s;&s;umed that Juri&s;diction, or that ever Ordinance had been made to &s;uch a purpo&s;e; nor could any Rebellion be more again&s;t the Law, than that Murtherous Act.</P>
<P>WHEN the fir&s;t Mention was made of their mon&s;trous purpo&s;e, of bringing the Arch-Bi&s;hop to a Trial for his Life, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who had allways a great Reverence and Affection for him, had &s;poken to the King of it, and propo&s;ed to him, <Q>&startq;that in all events, there might be a pardon prepared, and &s;ent to him, under the great Seal of <HI>England;</HI> to the end, if they proceeded again&s;t him in any form of Law, he might plead the King's pardon; which mu&s;t be allow'd by all who pretended to be govern'd by the Law; but if they proceeded in a Martial, or any other extraordinary way, without any form of Law, his Maje&s;ty &s;hould declare his Ju&s;tice and Affection to an old faithful Servant, whom he much e&s;teem'd, in having done all towards&endq; his pre&s;ervation that was in his power to do.</Q> The King was wonder|fully plea&s;ed with the Propo&s;ition; and took from thence occa&s;ion to commend the Piety and Virtue of the Arch-Bi&s;hop, with extraordinary Affection; and commanded the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to cau&s;e the Pardon to be prepared, and his Maje&s;ty would Sign and Seal it with all po&s;&s;ible &s;ecrecy; which at that time was nece&s;&s;ary. Whereupon the Chancellor &s;ent for S^r <HI>Thomas Gardiner</HI> the King's Sollicitor, and told him the King's plea&s;ure; upon which he pre&s;ently drew the Pardon, which was Sign'd and Seal'd with the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> and care|fully &s;ent, and deliver'd into the Arch-Bi&s;hop's own hand, before he was brought to his Trial; who receiv'd it with great joy, as it was a Te&s;timony of the King's gracious Affection to him, and care of him, without any opinion that they who endeavour'd to take away the King's Life, would pre&s;erve His by his Maje&s;ties Authority.</P>
<P>WHEN the Arch-Bi&s;hop's Council had peru&s;ed the Pardon, and con|&s;ider'd that all po&s;&s;ible Exceptions would be taken to it, though they &s;hould not reject it, they found, that the Impeachment was not &s;o di&s;tinctly &s;et down in the Pardon as it ought to be; which could not be helped at <HI>Oxford,</HI> becau&s;e they had no Copy of it; and therefore had &s;upplied it with all tho&s;e general expre&s;&s;ions, as, in any Court of Law, would make the Pardon valid again&s;t any exceptions the King's own Council could make again&s;t it. Hereupon, the Arch-Bi&s;hop had, by the &s;ame Me&s;&s;enger, return'd the Pardon again to the Chancellor, with &s;uch directions and copies as were nece&s;&s;ary; upon which it was perfected accordingly, and deliver'd &s;afely again to him, and was in his hands during the whole time of his Trial. So when his Trial was over, and the Ordinance pa&s;&s;ed for his Execution, and He called and asked, ac|cording

to cu&s;tom in criminal proceedings, <Q>&startq;what he could &s;ay more,&endq; why he &s;hould not &s;uffer death?</Q> he told them, <Q>&startq;that he had the King's gracious Pardon, which he pleaded, and tender'd to them, and de&s;ired&endq; that it might be allow'd.</Q> Whereupon he was &s;ent to the Tower, and the Pardon read in both Hou&s;es; <Q>where, without any long Debate, it was declared &startq;to be of no effect, and that the King could not Pardon&endq; a Judgement of Parliament.</Q> And &s;o, without troubling them&s;elves <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Arch-Bi|&s;hop beheaded.</NOTE> farther, they gave order for his Beheading; which he underwent with all Chri&s;tian Courage and Magnanimity, to the Admiration of the Be|holders and Confu&s;ion of his Enemies. Much hath been &s;aid of the Per|&s;on of this great Prelate before, of his great Endowments, and natural <MILESTONE N="10"> Infirmities, to which &s;hall be added no more in this place (his memory de&s;erving a particular celebration) than that his Learning, Piety, and Virtue, have been attain'd by very few, and the greate&s;t of his Infir|mities are common to all, even to the be&s;t Men.</P>
<P>WHEN they had di&s;patched this important work, and thereby re|ceiv'd a new In&s;tance of the good Affection and Courage of their Friends, and involv'd the two Hou&s;es in fre&s;h guilt and obloquy (for too many concurr'd in it, without con&s;idering the heinou&s;ne&s;s of it, and only to keep their credit clear and entire, whereby they might with the more Authority advance the Peace that was de&s;ired) they now enter upon <MILESTONE N="20"> the Debate, <Q>&startq;what An&s;wer they &s;hould &s;end the King, concerning a&endq; Treaty for Peace.</Q> They who de&s;ired to advance it, hoped thereby to put an end to all the de&s;igns of new modelling the Army, and to pre|vent the encrea&s;e of tho&s;e Factions in Religion, which every day broke out among them, to the notorious Scandal of Chri&s;tianity. They who had no mind to a Treaty, becau&s;e they had minds aver&s;e from all thoughts of Peace, di&s;cern'd plainly, that they &s;hould not be able to fini&s;h their de&s;ign upon the Army, and &s;et many other devices on foot, which would contribute to their convenience, until this longed for Treaty were at an end; and therefore they all agreed to give &s;ome conclu&s;ion <MILESTONE N="30"> to it; and re&s;olv'd, that there &s;hould be a Treaty, and upon the Method that &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd in the conducting it; from which they who &s;hould be employ'd by them, &s;hould not recede or be diverted.</P>
<P>THEN they nominated &s;ixteen Commi&s;&s;ioners for the two Hou&s;es, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The two Hou&s;es agree to a Treaty at</HI> Ux|bridge.</NOTE> and four for the Parliament of <HI>Scotland,</HI> and named <HI>Uxbridge</HI> for the place where the Treaty &s;hould be; which Treaty &s;hould be limited to be fini&s;hed within twenty days from the time when it &s;hould begin.</P>
<P>UPON this conclu&s;ion, they &s;ent their An&s;wer to the Me&s;&s;age, they had receiv'd from the King by a Trumpet, in a Letter from their General <MILESTONE N="40"> to the King's General; in which they inform'd his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;that, out of their pa&s;&s;ionate de&s;ire of Peace, they had agreed to his Propo&s;ition for a Treaty; and that they had a&s;&s;ign'd <HI>Uxbridge</HI> for the place where it &s;hould be; and had appointed the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Salisbury,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> of the Hou&s;e of Peers; and of the Commons, the Lord <HI>Wainman,</HI> M^r&endq; <HI>Pierpoint,</HI></Q> <Q>M^r <HI>Hollis,</HI> M^r <HI>Saint John</HI> (whom they called the King's Solli|citor General) &startq;S^r <HI>Henry Vane</HI> the younger, M^r <HI>Whitlock,</HI> M^r <HI>Crew,</HI> and M^r <HI>Prideaux;</HI> and for the Kingdom of <HI>Scotland,</HI> the Lord <HI>Lowden,&endq;</HI> Chancellor of <HI>Scotland;</HI></Q> <Q>the Lord <HI>Maitland</HI> (who, by the death of his Father, became Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> by the time of the Treaty) S^t <HI>&startq;Charles Erskin,</HI> and one M^r <HI>Barclay,</HI> to be their Commi&s;&s;ioners; to|gether with M^r <HI>Alexander Hender&s;on,</HI> in matters only which relate

<P>WHEN the Lord Keeper <HI>Littleton</HI> had fled from <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> upon his Maje&s;ties Commands to attend him at <HI>York,</HI> the two Hou&s;es had, in their fury, declared, <Q>&startq;that nothing which &s;hould, from that time, pa&s;s under the Great Seal, &s;hould be good and valid; but void and&endq; null:</Q> this they did to di&s;credit any Commi&s;&s;ion, which they fore&s;aw might i&s;&s;ue out for their Conviction, Trial, and Attainder: and, in &s;ome time after, they had cau&s;ed a Great Seal to be made with the King's Image, for the di&s;patch of the nece&s;&s;ary proce&s;s in Law, and proceed|ings in Courts of Ju&s;tice; which Seal was committed by them to &s;ome of their Members, who had &s;ate in the Chancery, and tran&s;acted the bu&s;ine&s;s of that Court, and applied the Seal to all tho&s;e u&s;es and pur|po&s;es it had been accu&s;tom'd unto. They found this Declaration and Ordinance of theirs, invaded in this Me&s;&s;age they had now receiv'd from the King.

<P>AFTER long Debate, they were contented to in&s;ert their Names in their Safe Conduct, without their Honours, or Offices; and they were &s;o angry with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, that they had no mind

<P>ABOUT the end of <HI>January,</HI> or the beginning of <HI>February,</HI> the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners on both &s;ides met at <HI>Uxbridge;</HI> which being within the Ene|mies <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Treaty at</HI> Uxbridge.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="20"> Quarters, the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners were to have &s;uch Accommoda|tions, as the other thought fit to leave to them; who had been very civil in the di&s;tribution, and left one entire &s;ide of the Town to the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners, one Hou&s;e only excepted, which was given to the Earl of <HI>Pembroke;</HI> &s;o that they had no cau&s;e to complain of their Accom|modation; which was as good as the Town would yeild, and as good as the other had. There was a good Hou&s;e at the end of the Town, which was provided for the Treaty, where was a fair Room in the middle of the Hou&s;e, hand&s;omly dre&s;&s;ed up for the Commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;it in; a large &s;quare Table being placed in the middle with Seats for the Commi&s;&s;io|ners, one &s;ide being &s;ufficient for tho&s;e of either party; and a Rail for others who &s;hould be thought nece&s;&s;ary to be pre&s;ent, which went round. There were many other Rooms on either &s;ide of this great Room, for the Commi&s;&s;ioners on either &s;ide to retire to, when they thought fit to con&s;ult by them&s;elves, and to return again to the publick Debate; and there being good Staires at either end of the Hou&s;e, they never went through each others Quarters; nor met, but in the great Room.</P>
<P>AS SOON as the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners came to the Town, all tho&s;e of the Parliament came to vi&s;it and to welcome them; and, within an hour, tho&s;e of the King's return'd their vi&s;its with u&s;ual Civilities; each profe&s;|&s;ing great de&s;ire and hope, that the Treaty would produce a good Peace. The fir&s;t vi&s;its were altogether, and in one Room; the <HI>Scots</HI> being in the &s;ame Room with the <HI>Engli&s;h.</HI> Each Party eat allways together, there be|ing two great Inns which &s;erv'd very well to that purpo&s;e. The Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> being Steward of his Maje&s;ties Hou&s;e, kept his Table there for all the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners: nor was there any re&s;traint from giv|ing and receiving Vi&s;its apart, as their acquaintance, and inclinations di&s;po&s;ed them; in which tho&s;e of the King's Party u&s;ed their accu&s;tom'd Freedom, as heretofore. But on the other &s;ide, there was great war$+ne&s;s and re&s;ervedne&s;s; and &s;o great a jealou&s;ie of each other, that they had no mind to give, or receive Vi&s;its to, or from their old Friends; who$ they loved better than their New. Nor would any of them be &s;een alo$

It was ob&s;erved by the Town, and the People that flocked thither, that the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners looked as if they were at home and govern'd the Town; and the other as if they were not in their own Quarters; and the truth is, they had not that alacrity and &s;erenity of mind, as Men u&s;e to have who do not believe them&s;elves to be in a fault.</P>
<P>THE King's Commi&s;&s;ioners would willingly have performed their Devotions in the Church, nor was there any re&s;traint upon them from doing &s;o, that is by Inhibition from the Parliament, otherwi&s;e than that <MILESTONE N="10"> by the Parliament's Ordinance (as they call'd it) the Book of Common-Prayer was not permitted to be read, nor the Ve&s;tures, nor Ceremonies of the Church to be u&s;ed.

<P>WHEN the Commi&s;&s;ioners, on both &s;ides, met fir&s;t together in the Room appointed for the Treaty, and had taken their Seats, it being left to the Kings Commi&s;&s;ioners, which &s;ide of the Table they would take; the Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who allways deliver'd any thing that was <MILESTONE N="20"> agreed between them, and read all the Papers (after the Powers of both &s;ides were examined, and peru&s;ed) propos'd &s;ome Rules to be ob&s;erved in the Treaty; <Q>&startq;as of having Nothing binding, unle&s;s All were agreed&endq; upon;</Q> and &s;uch like; to which there was no objection; and offer'd, as a direction they had receiv'd from the Parliament, <Q>that they &s;hould fir&s;t &startq;enter upon the matter of Religion, and Treat three entire days upon that Subject, without entring upon any other; and if all Differences, in that particular, were not adju&s;ted within tho&s;e days, they &s;hould then proceed to the next Point, which was the Militia; and ob&s;erve the &s;ame Method in that, and from thence pa&s;s to the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland;</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> which three Points being well &s;ettled, they believed the other diffe|rences would be with more ea&s;e compo&s;ed: and after tho&s;e Nine days were pa&s;&s;ed, they were to go round again upon the &s;everal Subjects, as long as the time limited would continue: his Maje&s;ty being left at li|berty to propo&s;e what he thought fit, at his own time, and to change&endq; the Method propo&s;ed.</Q> <Q>It was declared, &startq;that the Twenty days, limit|ed for the Treaty, were to be reckon'd of the days which &s;hould be &s;pent in the Treaty, and not the days of coming or returning, or the&endq; days &s;pent in Devotion;</Q> there falling out three Sundays and a Fa&s;t day in tho&s;e Twenty days. The Method was willingly con&s;ented to; the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners conceiving it would be to no purpo&s;e to propo&s;e any thing on the King's behalf, till they di&s;cerned what agreement was like to be made in any one particular; by which they might take their Mea&s;ures, and might propo&s;e any thing of Moment under one of the three Heads mention'd before.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd a very odd Accident, the very fir&s;t Morning they met at the Hou&s;e to agree upon their Method to be ob&s;erv'd in the Treaty. It was a Market day, when they u&s;ed always to have a Sermon, and many of the Per&s;ons who came from <HI>Oxford</HI> in the Commi&s;&s;ioners Train, went to the Church to ob&s;erve the forms. There was one <HI>Love,</HI> a young Man, that came from <HI>London</HI> with the Commi&s;&s;ioners, who preached, and told his Auditory, which con&s;i&s;ted of the People of the Town, and of tho&s;e who came to the Market, the Church being very full,
<Q><PB N="446" REF="5090">
&startq;that they were not to expect any good from the Treaty; for that they came from <HI>Oxford</HI> with hearts full of Blood, and that there was as great di&s;tance between this Treaty and Peace, as between Heaven and Hell; and that they intended only to amu&s;e the People with expecta|tion&endq; of Peace,</Q> till they were able to do &s;ome notable mi&s;chief to them; and inveighed &s;o &s;editiou&s;ly again&s;t all Cavaliers, that is, again&s;t all who followed the King, and again&s;t the Per&s;ons of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that he could be under&s;tood to intend nothing el&s;e, but to &s;tir up the People to mutiny; and in it to do &s;ome Act of Violence upon the Commi&s;&s;io|ners. They were no &s;ooner adverti&s;ed of it, by &s;everal Per&s;ons who had been pre&s;ent in the Church, and who gave very particular Information <MILESTONE N="10"> of the very words which had been &s;poken, than they inform'd the other Commi&s;&s;ioners of it; gave them a Charge in writing again&s;t the Preacher; and demanded publick Ju&s;tice. They &s;eem'd troubled at it, and promi&s;ed to examin it, and cau&s;e &s;ome &s;evere puni&s;hment to be inflicted upon the Man; but afterwards confe&s;&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that they had no Authority to puni&s;h him, but that they had cau&s;ed him to be &s;harply reprehended, and to&endq; be &s;ent out of the Town;</Q> and this was all that could be obtain'd: &s;o unwilling they were to di&s;countenance any Man who was willing to &s;erve them. This is the &s;ame <HI>Love,</HI> who &s;ome years after, by <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s par|ticular pro&s;ecution, had his head cut off, for being in a Plot with the <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Scots</HI> again&s;t the Army, and their Parliament.</P>
<P>IT is not the purpo&s;e of this Di&s;cour&s;e to &s;et down the particular tran&s;actions of this Treaty; which were publi&s;hed by the King's Order, &s;hortly after the conclu&s;ion of it, and all the Papers, which had been de|livered by the Commi&s;&s;ioners on either &s;ide, expo&s;ed to the View of the Kingdom, in the method and manner in which they were delivered. Only &s;uch particulars as fell out in that time, and were never communi|cated, and many of them known to very few, &s;hall be briefly mentioned, that any, who hereafter &s;hall have the peru&s;al of this Hi&s;tory, may know <MILESTONE N="30"> how impo&s;&s;ible it was, that this Treaty could produce &s;uch a Peace as both &s;ides would have been glad of; and that they who govern'd the Par|liament then, had at that time the re&s;olution to Act tho&s;e mon&s;trous things, which they brought afterwards to pa&s;s.</P>
<P>THE fir&s;t bu&s;ine&s;s to be entred upon, being that of Religion, the Di|vines <NOTE PLACE="marg">Fir&s;t of Reli|gion.</NOTE> of both &s;ides were admitted to be pre&s;ent in the places appointed for them, oppo&s;ite to each other; and D^r <HI>Steward,</HI> Clerk of the Clo&s;et to the King, was a Commi&s;&s;ioner, as M^r <HI>Hender&s;on</HI> was on the other &s;ide; and they both &s;ate cover'd without the Bar, at the backs of the Commi&s;|&s;ioners. On the Parliament Part, it was propo&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that all the Bi&s;hops, <MILESTONE N="40"> Deans and Chapters, might be immediately taken away, and aboli&s;hed; and in the room thereof, that there might be another Government erected; &s;uch as &s;hould be mo&s;t agreeable to Gods word, and the Pra|ctice of the be&s;t Churches: That the Book of Common-Prayer might be taken away, and totally &s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and that, in&s;tead thereof, a Di|rectory&endq; might be u&s;ed (in which there was likewi&s;e &s;et down as much of the Government,</Q> which they meant to erect for the future, as was nece&s;&s;ary to be provided for the pre&s;ent, and which &s;upplied all the u&s;e of Articles of Canons, <Q>which they had likewi&s;e aboli&s;hed) and &startq;that the King him&s;elf &s;hould take the Covenant; and con&s;ent to an Act Parlia|ment, whereby all Per&s;ons of the Kingdom &s;hould be likewi&s;e oblig'd&endq; to take it.</Q> And the Copies of the Covenant, and the Directory were deliver'd at the &s;ame time to the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners; which were very

long, and nece&s;&s;ary to be read over, before any An&s;wer could be made to them. So they took that afternoon to peru&s;e them together, and ad|journ'd their Treaty till the next Morning; and though they enter'd up|on the reading them before dinner, the Directory was &s;o very long, that they &s;pent all that Afternoon, and &s;ome part of the Night, before they had fini&s;hed the reading of them. Then, there being many new terms in the Directory, as <HI>Congregational, Cla&s;&s;ical, Provincial,</HI> and <HI>Synodical,</HI> which were not known in practice, and &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions in the Cove|nant, which were ambiguous, and they well knew, were left &s;o, becau&s;e the Per&s;ons who fram'd them, were not all of one mind, nor had the &s;ame <MILESTONE N="10"> Intentions in &s;ome of the other terms mentioned before, the King's Com|mi&s;&s;ioners cau&s;ed many Que&s;tions to be prepared in writing, to be offer'd at the next meeting; wherein they de&s;ired to be inform'd, what their meaning was in &s;uch and &s;uch Expre&s;&s;ions, in which they knew well they had &s;everal meanings, and would hardly concur in one, and the &s;ame An&s;wer.</P>
<P>ABOUT the beginning of the Treaty, or the day before it did begin, the Earl of <HI>Lowden,</HI> Chancellor of <HI>Scotland,</HI> vi&s;ited the Duke of <HI>Rich|mond</HI> privately in his Chamber; and either propo&s;ed, or was very wil|ling, to have private conference there with the Chancellor of the Ex|chequer; <MILESTONE N="20"> upon which the Duke, who knew well $he other would not decline it, &s;ent to him; and He pre&s;ently went to the Duke's Chamber; where he found them both; and after &s;ome &s;hort Compliments, the Earl told him, <Q>&startq;how &s;toutly he had defended his Knighthood; which the Parliament had re&s;olv'd to have denied, if he had not con|vinced&endq; them.</Q> <Q>Thence, he di&s;cour&s;ed of &startq;the great prejudice the Par|liament had again&s;t him, as a Man who more indu&s;triou&s;ly oppos'd Peace than any other of the King's Council; that he had now a good op|portunity to wipe off all tho&s;e jealou&s;ies, by being a good In&s;trument in making this Peace, and by per&s;wading his Maje&s;ty to comply with <MILESTONE N="30"> the de&s;ires and &s;upplications of his Parliament; which he hoped he&endq; would be.</Q></P>
<P>THE Chancellor told him, <Q>&startq;that the King did &s;o much de&s;ire a Peace, that no Man need advi&s;e him to it, or could divert him from it, if fair and honourable conditions of Peace were offer'd to him; but if a Peace could not be had, but upon &s;uch conditions as his Maje&s;ty judged incon&s;i&s;tent with his Honour, or his Con&s;cience, no Man could have credit enough to per&s;wade him to accept it; and that, for His own part, without reflecting upon the good or ill opinion the Parlia|ment&endq; might have of him,</Q> he would di&s;&s;wade him from con&s;enting to it. <MILESTONE N="40"> The other &s;eem'd di&s;appointed in his &s;o po&s;itive An&s;wer; yet, with great freedom, enter'd upon di&s;cour&s;e of the whole matter; and, after &s;ome kind of Apology, <Q>&startq;that <HI>Scotland</HI> was &s;o far engaged in the Quarrel, con|trary&endq; to their former Intentions,</Q> and Profe&s;&s;ions, he did as good as conclude, <Q>&startq;that if the King would &s;atisfie them in the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Church, they would not concern them&s;elves in any of the other De|mands.&endq;</Q> In which propo&s;ition, finding no kind of Compliance from the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but &s;harp prote&s;tations again&s;t the de|mands, as incon&s;i&s;tent with Con&s;cience, Ju&s;tice, or Religion, the con|ference broke off, without inclination in either of them to renew it. But, from that time, there was more contradiction, and quick repartees between them two throughout the Treaty, than between any other of the Commi&s;&s;ioners. And it was manife&s;t enough, by the private Con|ferences
<PB N="448" REF="5120">
with other of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, that the Parliament took none of the points in controver&s;y le&s;s to heart, or were le&s;s united in, than in what concern'd the Church.</P>
<P>WHEN, upon the next meeting of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, the Que&s;tions, which were mention'd before, were read, and deliver'd by the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> who allways perform'd that part on the behalf of the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners, as the Earl of <HI>Northumberland</HI> did on the Parliaments, there was a vi&s;ible di&s;order in their Countenances; <Q>&s;ome of them, &s;miling, &s;aid, We &startq;&endq;looked into Their Game;</Q> but without offering at any An&s;wer, they aro&s;e, and went to their Room of con&s;ultation; where they remain'd in great pa&s;&s;ion, and wrangling, many hours: &s;o that the <MILESTONE N="10"> other Commi&s;&s;ioners, finding that they were not like &s;uddainly to agree, adjourn'd till the Afternoon, and departed to dinner. A&s;&s;oon as they came together in the Afternoon, and were &s;ate, the Earl of <HI>Northum|berland</HI> &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that they wonder'd there &s;hould appear any difficulty in any expre&s;&s;ions, upon which tho&s;e Que&s;tions had been admini&s;ter'd in the Morning; which to Them &s;eem'd very clear and plain; however, to give their Lord&s;hips &s;atisfaction, that they had appointed another noble Lord, there pre&s;ent, who was well acquainted with the &s;ignifi|cation of all tho&s;e words, to explain what the common &s;en&s;e, and&endq; meaning of them was.</Q> Thereupon, the Earl of <HI>Lauderdale</HI> made a <MILESTONE N="20"> di&s;cour&s;e upon the &s;everal Que&s;tions, and what acceptation tho&s;e expre&s;|&s;ions and words had. But, being a young Man, not accu&s;tom'd to an orderly and decent way of &s;peaking, and having no gracious pronoun|ciation, and full of pa&s;&s;ion, he made every thing much more difficult than it was before: So that the Commi&s;&s;ioners de&s;ired, <Q>&startq;that they might receive an An&s;wer in writing; &s;ince it was declared upon the entrance of the Treaty, that though in Debate any Man might &s;ay what he thought nece&s;&s;ary, yet nothing &s;hould be under&s;tood to be the &s;en&s;e of either &s;ide, but what was deliver'd in Writing; and therefore they de&s;ired, that what that Noble Lord had &s;aid, which they pre&s;umed <MILESTONE N="30"> was the &s;en&s;e of all the re&s;t, becau&s;e they had referr'd to Him, and &s;eem'd &s;atisfied with what he had deliver'd, might be given to them in writing; without which they knew not how to proceed, or give an&endq; An&s;wer to what was propo&s;ed to them.</Q> This demand, founded upon a Rule of their own, which they knew not how to decline, put the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners into great pa&s;&s;ion: for all the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> &s;ate &s;till with|out &s;peaking a word, as if they were not concern'd. The Lord <HI>Lauder|dale</HI> repeated what he had &s;aid before, a little more di&s;tinctly; and the Chancellor of <HI>Scotland</HI> &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that the things were &s;o plain, that no Man could choo&s;e but under&s;tand, and remember what was &s;poken; <MILESTONE N="40"> and that the pre&s;&s;ing to put it in writing was only to &s;pend time; which would be quickly out, half the time a&s;&s;ign'd for the bu&s;ine&s;s of&endq; Religion being to expire that night;</Q> and therefore pa&s;&s;ionately de&s;ired them, <Q>&startq;that they would re&s;t &s;atisfied with what had been &s;poken, and&endq; proceed upon the matter.</Q></P>
<P><Q>IT was replied, &startq;that they could not tru&s;t their Memories &s;o far, as to prepare an An&s;wer to their demands concerning the Covenant, or Directory, except they were &s;ure that they under&s;tood the full and de|clared meaning of their demand; which they had le&s;s rea&s;on now to believe they did, than before; &s;ince there was &s;o much difficulty made to &s;atisfy them in writing; and therefore they mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon re|ceiving&endq; an An&s;wer to the Papers they had given:</Q> And two or three
<PB N="449" REF="5130">
of the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners withdrew, and prepared another Paper; in which they &s;et down the rea&s;ons which obliged them not to be &s;ati&s;|fied with the di&s;cour&s;e which had been made, and why they mu&s;t in&s;i&s;t upon the having it in writing; which being communicated to the re&s;t as they &s;ate, was likewi&s;e deliver'd to the others; who could not refu&s;e to receive it, though it was plain enough they never intended to give any An&s;wer in writing; nor they on the King's &s;ide, to de&s;i&s;t from de|manding it: but they declared, <Q>&startq;that as they pre&s;umed, they &s;hould, in the end, receive their An&s;wer in writing, which they &s;hould not depart from, &s;o it was their re&s;olution not to defer their farther pro|ceeding upon the matter; but they were ready to pro&s;ecute that in&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> the method they would de&s;ire;</Q> <Q>and &s;o it was re&s;olv'd, &startq;the next Morn|ing, to hear the Divines, who were of either Party, what they would &s;ay again&s;t or for Epi&s;copacy, and the Government, and Lands of the&endq; Church;</Q> which were equally concern'd in the Debate.</P>
<P>ON the King's part, be&s;ides D^r <HI>Steward,</HI> who was a Commi&s;&s;ioner in matters relating to the Church, there was D^r <HI>Sheldon,</HI> afterwards Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury;</HI> D^r <HI>Lany,</HI> afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Ely;</HI> D^r <HI>Fern,</HI> afterwards Bi&s;hop of <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> D^r <HI>Potter,</HI> then Dean of <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and Provo&s;t of Queens College in <HI>Oxford;</HI> and D^r <HI>Hammond;</HI> all who, be|ing <MILESTONE N="20"> the King's Chaplains, were &s;ent by him to attend the Commi&s;&s;ioners for their Devotions, and for the other Service of the Church, as the management of the Treaty required; which could not be fore&s;een: On the Parliament &s;ide, be&s;ides M^r <HI>Alexander Hender&s;on,</HI> who was the Commi&s;&s;ioner, M^r <HI>Mar&s;hall</HI> a Country Par&s;on in <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and an eminent Preacher of that Party, who was the Chief Chaplain in the Army, M^r <HI>Vines,</HI> a Par&s;on likewi&s;e in <HI>Warwick-&s;hire,</HI> and a Scholar (both of them of the A&s;&s;embly of Divines, and &s;o, very conver&s;ant in tho&s;e points re|lating to the Church, which had been &s;o often di&s;puted there) M^r <HI>Chey|nel,</HI> one who had been Fellow of <HI>Merton</HI> College in <HI>Oxford,</HI> and two <MILESTONE N="30"> or three others; who, bearing no parts in the di&s;putes, had not their names remember'd.</P>
<P>M^r <HI>Hender&s;on</HI> begun rather with Rhetorick, than Logick, <Q>&startq;of the nece&s;&s;ity to change the Government of the Church, for the pre&s;erva|tion of the State; which was &s;o much in danger, that it could be pre|&s;erv'd no other way; and therefore that in con&s;cience it ought to be con&s;ented to; that the Que&s;tion was not about the pre&s;ervation of Both, which, by the Wi&s;doms of the Parliaments of both Nations, was found to be impo&s;&s;ible; but &s;ince there could but one &s;tand, whe|ther they &s;hould be both &s;acrificed, or the Church given up, that the <MILESTONE N="40"> State might be pre&s;erv'd: nor was the Que&s;tion now whether Epi&s;co|pacy was Lawful, and the Government by Bi&s;hops con&s;i&s;tent with Re|ligion, but whether it was &s;o nece&s;&s;ary, that Religion could not be pre&s;erv'd without it; which was to condemn all the Reform'd Churches of <HI>Europe,</HI> where there were no Bi&s;hops, <HI>England</HI> only excepted. It ought therefore to &s;uffice, that the Parliament, which be&s;t under&s;tood what was good for the Nation, had found it to be a very unnece&s;&s;ary, inconvenient, and corrupt Government, that had been productive of great mi&s;chief to the Kingdom from the very time of the Reforma|tion; that the Bi&s;hops had allways favour'd Popery, and pre&s;erv'd, <MILESTONE N="50"> and continued many of the Rights and Cu&s;toms thereof in their Go|vernment, and practice; and had of late introduced many Innovations into the Church, by the example and pattern of the Church of <HI>Rome,</HI>

<P><Q>D^r <HI>Steward,</HI> with a much better countenance, told the Commi&s;|&s;ioners, <MILESTONE N="30"> &startq;that he hoped and knew, that their Lord&s;hips were too well acquainted with the Con&s;titution of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> and the Foundation upon which it &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, to believe it could be &s;haken by any of tho&s;e Arguments which had been made again&s;t it. He &s;aid, that though he did believe, it was impo&s;&s;ible to prove that a Govern|ment, &s;ettled and continued without intermi&s;&s;ion, from the time when Chri&s;tianity was fir&s;t planted in <HI>England,</HI> and under which the Chri|&s;tian Religion had &s;o much flouri&s;hed, was an unlawful and Anti-Chri&s;tian Government, yet that he expected, that they who had &s;worn to aboli&s;h it, and came now to per&s;wade their Lord&s;hips to concur <MILESTONE N="40"> with them, in pre&s;&s;ing the King to joyn in the &s;ame obligation, would not urge a le&s;s argument for &s;uch their Engagement, than the unlaw|fulne&s;s, and wickedne&s;s of that Government, which con&s;cience obliged them to remove.

<P>UPON the&s;e &s;everal points, and what re&s;ulted from thence, the Di|vines on both &s;ides &s;pent all that day, morning and afternoon, till it was very late in the night, and mo&s;t part of the next day; only the Commi&s;&s;ioners on either &s;ide, at the fir&s;t coming together, mornings and afternoons, pre&s;ented &s;uch Papers as they thought fit, upon what had pa&s;&s;ed in Debate: As, the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners de&s;ired to know in writing, <Q>&startq;whether the Parliament Commi&s;&s;ioners did believe that the&endq; Government of the Church by Bi&s;hops was unlawful?</Q> To which they could never obtain a Categorical An&s;wer.</P>
<P>WHEN the la&s;t of the three fir&s;t days was pa&s;t (for it was near twelve of the Clock at night) and the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners ob&s;erv'd that nothing was con&s;ented to which they looked for, the Chancellor of <HI>Scot|land</HI> enter'd into a long di&s;cour&s;e, <Q>with much pa&s;&s;ion, again&s;t Bi&s;hops, &startq;of the mi&s;chief they had done in all Ages, and of their being the &s;ole Cau&s;es of the late Troubles in <HI>Scotland,</HI> and of the pre&s;ent Troubles&endq; in <HI>England:</HI></Q> Remember'd, <Q>&startq;that the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> had pur&s;ued the Introduction of the Liturgy and the Canons into <HI>Scot|land,</HI> with &s;o great vehemence, that, when it was de&s;ired, that the publi&s;hing them might be &s;u&s;pended for one Month, that the People might be the better prepared to &s;ubmit to what they had not been be|fore acquainted with, he would by no means con&s;ent to that delay; but cau&s;ed it to be enter'd upon the next <HI>Sunday,</HI> again&s;t the advice of many of the Bi&s;hops them&s;elves; which put the People into &s;uch a fury, that they could not be appea&s;ed. He lamented and complain'd, that three days had been now &s;pent in fruitle&s;s Debates; and that though their Divines had learnedly made it appear, that Epi&s;copacy had no foundation in Scripture, and that it might be lawfully taken away; and that notwith&s;tanding it was evident, that it had been the&endq; cau&s;e of great mi&s;chief,</Q> and the Wi&s;dom of Parliament had thought

&startq;the utter taking it away to be ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary for the pre&s;ervation of the Kingdom; their Lord&s;hips were &s;till unmoved, and had yeilded in no one particular of importance, to give them &s;atisfaction; from which they could not but conclude, that they did not bring that hearty&endq; inclination to Peace,</Q> which they hoped they would have done; and &s;o concluded with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions more rude and in&s;olent, than were expected.</P>
<P><Q>WHEREUPON the Chancellor of the Exchequer, not without &s;ome commotion, &s;aid, &startq;that he did not wonder, that their Lord&s;hips, who had for &s;ome years been accu&s;tomed to &s;uch Di&s;cour&s;es, and the more <MILESTONE N="10"> inclin'd to &s;uppo&s;e all that was confidently &s;aid to be rea&s;onably prov'd, and &s;o having not been u&s;ed to conver&s;e with any Per&s;ons of a contrary opinion, had been brought to con&s;ent and approve tho&s;e alterations, which they had propo&s;ed; but that it &s;eem'd very admirable to him, that their Lord&s;hips could expect, or imagine it po&s;&s;ible, that they who never had heard &s;uch things &s;aid before, nor could under&s;tand in &s;o little time what had been now &s;aid, &s;hould depart from a Faith, and a form of Wor&s;hip, in which they had been educated from their Cradle; and which, upon &s;o long ob&s;ervation, and experience, they looked upon with all po&s;&s;ible approbation and reverence, upon only hearing it inveighed again&s;t three days; which would have been much too lit|tle <MILESTONE N="20"> time, to have warranted a Conver&s;ion from much le&s;s important opinions, they had &s;o long entertain'd; though their Arguments had&endq; Had as much weight as they Wanted. He &s;aid,</Q> <Q>&startq;they were of opinion, that all tho&s;e mi&s;chiefs and inconveniences which they had mention'd, had in truth proceeded from an over vehement de&s;ire to overthrow Epi&s;copacy, not from the Zeal to &s;upport it: that if the Arch-Bi&s;hop of <HI>Canterbury</HI> had been too precipitate in pre&s;&s;ing the reception of that, which He thought a Reformation, he paid dearly for it; which made him the more wonder, that they &s;hould blame Them, for not &s;ubmit|ting <MILESTONE N="30"> to much greater alterations, than were at that time propo&s;ed, in three days; when they reproached Him, for not having given Them&endq; a whole month to con&s;ider.</Q> He &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he might a&s;&s;ure their Lord&s;hips with great &s;incerity, that they were come thither with all imaginable pa&s;&s;ion and de&s;ire, that the Treaty might conclude in a happy and ble&s;|&s;ed Peace; as he &s;till hoped it would; but if it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e, that they would &s;till believe, their Lord&s;hips brought with them the &s;ame honourable and pious Inclinations, though the In&s;tructions, and Commands from tho&s;e who tru&s;ted them, re&s;trained them from con|&s;enting&endq; to what in their own judgments &s;eem'd rea&s;onable.</Q> And &s;o, without any manner of reply, both &s;ides aro&s;e, and departed, it being near midnight.</P>
<P>THERE happen'd a plea&s;ant Accident on one of the&s;e days, which were a&s;&s;igned for the matter of Religion. The Commi&s;&s;ioners of both &s;ides, either before their &s;itting, or after their ri&s;ing, entertaining them|&s;elves together by the fire &s;ide, as they &s;ometimes did, it being extremely cold, in general and ca&s;ual di&s;cour&s;es, One of the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners asked one of the other with whom he had familiarity, in a low Voice, <Q>&startq;why there was not in their whole Directory, any mention at all of the&endq; Creed, or the Ten Commandments, and &s;o little of the Lords Prayer?</Q> which is only once recommended. The Earl of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> overhearing the di&s;cour&s;e, an&s;wer'd aloud, and with his u&s;ual pa&s;&s;ion, <Q>&startq;that He, and many others, were very &s;orry that they had been left out; that the put|ting
<PB N="453" REF="5170">
them in had taken up many hours debate in the Hou&s;e of Com|mons, and that at la&s;t the leaving them out had been carried by eight or nine Voices; and &s;o they did not think fit to in&s;i&s;t upon the addi|tion of them in the Hou&s;e of Peers; but many were afterwards troubled at i$, and he verily believ'd, if it were to do again, they &s;hould carry it,&endq; for the in&s;erting 'em all;</Q> which made many &s;mile, to hear that the Creed, and the Ten Commandments, had been put to the Que&s;tion, and rejected: and many of the other were troubled, and out of Countenance with the rea&s;on the good Lord had given for the Exclu&s;ion.</P>
<P><Q>THE next Subject of the Treaty was the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Militia; which <NOTE PLACE="marg">Secondly of the Militia.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="10"> their Commi&s;&s;ioners po&s;itively requir'd, &startq;to be entirely ve&s;ted in the Parliament, and in &s;uch Per&s;ons as they thought fit to be confided in. This, they &s;aid, was more nece&s;&s;ary than ever, for the &s;ecuring the People from their Fears and Jealou&s;ies; which were now much en|crea&s;ed,&endq;</Q> and were capable of being a&s;&s;waged by no other means: and delivered a large Paper to that purpo&s;e, which contained no more than had been often &s;aid in their Declarations, and as often an&s;wered in tho&s;e which had been publi&s;hed by the King. And when the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the King, whereof there were four very eminent in the knowledge of the Law, <HI>Lane, Gardiner, Bridgman,</HI> and <HI>Palmer,</HI> made the demand <MILESTONE N="20"> appear to be without any pretence of Law, or Ju&s;tice, and a&s;&s;erted it to be ve&s;ted in the King by the Law, they never offer'd to alledge any other Argument, than the determination of the Parliament, which had de|clared the right of the Militia to be in Them, from which they could not recede; &s;o that the Conferences were very &s;hort upon tho&s;e days, but the Papers very long which were mutually delivered; the preparing whereof took up the time; <Q>they of that &s;ide (even they who mo&s;t de|&s;ired the Peace) both publickly and privately in&s;i&s;ting &startq;upon having the whole Command of the Militia by Sea, and Land, and all the Forts, and Ships of the Kingdom at their di&s;po&s;al; without which they look|ed&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> upon them&s;elves as lo&s;t,</Q> and at the King's mercy; not con&s;idering that He mu&s;t be at Theirs, if &s;uch a power was committed to them. But in this particular, he who was mo&s;t rea&s;onable among them, thought it very unrea&s;onable to deny them that nece&s;&s;ary Security; and believed it could proceed from nothing el&s;e, but a Re&s;olution to take the highe&s;t Vengeance upon their Rebellion.</P>
<P>THEN they entred upon the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland;</HI> in which they <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thirdly of</HI> Ireland.</NOTE> thought they had the King at very great advantage; and that his Com|mi&s;&s;ioners would not be able to an&s;wer the Charges they &s;hould make up|on that particular. And many of the Commi&s;&s;ioners on the King's part, <MILESTONE N="40"> who had not been well acquainted with tho&s;e Tran&s;actions, thought it would be a hard matter to ju&s;tify all that the King had been nece&s;&s;itated to do; and any thing of Grace towards the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebels, was as ungracious at <HI>Oxford,</HI> as it was at <HI>London;</HI> becau&s;e they knew the whole Kingdom had a great dete&s;tation of them. They ripped up all that had been done from the beginning of that Rebellion; <Q>&startq;how the King had voluntarily committed the carrying on that War to the two Hou&s;es of Parliament; that they had levied great Sums of Money upon the Kingdom for that &s;ervice; but finding that it was like to bring a greater Burthen upon the Kingdom than it could bear, that his Maje&s;ty had con&s;ented to an Act of Parliament for the Encouragement of Adventurers to bring in Mo|ney, upon A&s;&s;urance of having Land a&s;&s;igned to them in that Kingdom, out of the forfeitures of the Rebels, a&s;&s;oon as the Rebellion &s;hould be
<PB N="454" REF="5180">
&s;uppre&s;&s;ed; and had likewi&s;e, by the &s;ame Act, put it out of his Power to make any Peace, or Ce&s;&s;ation with tho&s;e Rebels, or to Grant par|don to any of them without con&s;ent of Parliament; and thereupon many of his Maje&s;ties Subjects had brought in very con&s;iderable Sums of Money, by which they had been able to manage that War without putting this Kingdom to farther Charge; and God had &s;o ble&s;&s;ed the Prote&s;tant Forces there, that they had &s;ubdued and vanqui&s;hed the Rebels in all encounters; and probably, by that time, the whole Re|bellion had been extingui&s;hed, if the King had not, contrary to his pro|mi&s;e, and obligation by that Act of Parliament, made a Ce&s;&s;ation with tho&s;e execrable Rebels, when they were not able to continue the War; <MILESTONE N="10"> and had call'd over many of tho&s;e Regiments, which the Parliament had &s;ent over again&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> to return hither to fight again&s;t the Par|liament: by means whereof his Prote&s;tant Subjects of that Kingdom were in great danger to be de&s;troyed, and the Kingdom to be entirely&endq; po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Papi&s;ts.</Q> They enlarged them&s;elves upon this Subject, with all the invidious in&s;inuations they could devi&s;e, to make the People believe, that the King was inclined to, and favoured that Rebellion. They demanded, <Q>&startq;that the King would forthwith declare that Ce&s;&s;ation to be Void; and that he would pro&s;ecute the War again&s;t tho&s;e Rebels with the utmo&s;t fury; and that the Act of Parliament for their reduction,&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> might be executed as it ought to be.</Q></P>
<P>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners of the King prepar'd and deliver'd a very full An|&s;wer in writing to all their demands; at the delivery whereof, they ap|pointed the Chancellor of the Exchequer to enlarge upon any of tho&s;e particulars, which prov'd the Coun&s;els that had been taken, ju&s;t, and ne|ce&s;&s;ary. This he did &s;o particularly and convincingly, that tho&s;e of the Parliament were in much confu&s;ion, and the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners much plea&s;ed. <Q>He put them in mind of &startq;their bringing tho&s;e very Troops, which were levied by the King's Authority for the Suppre&s;&s;ion of the Rebellion in <HI>Ireland,</HI> to fight agai&s;t the King at <HI>Edge-hill,</HI> under the <MILESTONE N="30"> Command of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> of their having given over the pro&s;e|cution of that War, or &s;ending any &s;upply of Arms, Money, or Ammu|nition thither; having imployed tho&s;e Magazins which were provid|ed for that Service, again&s;t his Maje&s;ty; in&s;omuch as the Privy Coun|cil of that Kingdom had &s;ent to his Maje&s;ty, that he would provide &s;ome other way for the pre&s;ervation of that Kingdom, &s;ince they could not be able to &s;upport the War any longer, again&s;t the united Power of the Rebels: That all Overtures, which his Maje&s;ty had made to|wards Peace, had been rejected by the Parliament; and one hundred <MILESTONE N="40"> thou&s;and pounds, brought in by the Adventurers for <HI>Ireland,</HI> had been &s;ent in one entire Sum into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to prepare and di&s;po&s;e that Kingdom to &s;end an Army to invade This; which they had done, and till then his Maje&s;ty had not, in the lea&s;t degree, &s;werved from the ob&s;ervation of that Act of Parliament; but when he &s;aw that the Par|liament, in&s;tead of pro&s;ecuting the end and intention of that Statute, applyed it wholely to the carrying on the War again&s;t Him&s;elf, he thought him&s;elf ab&s;olv'd before God and Man, if he did all he could to re&s;cue and defend him&s;elf again&s;t their Violence, by making a Ce&s;|&s;ation with the Rebels in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and by drawing over &s;ome Regiments <MILESTONE N="50"> of his own Army from thence, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in <HI>England:</HI> which Ce&s;|&s;ation had hitherto pre&s;erved the Prote&s;tants of that Kingdom; who were not able without &s;upplies to pre&s;erve them&s;elves from the &s;trength
<PB N="455" REF="5190">
and power of the Rebels; which &s;upplies his Maje&s;ty could not, and the Parliament would not &s;end; and therefore, if the Prote&s;tants there, &s;hould hereafter be oppre&s;&s;ed by the Rebels, who every day procur'd a&s;&s;i&s;tance from abroad, and &s;o were like to be more powerfull, all the mi&s;chiefs and mi&s;ery that mu&s;t attend them, would, before God and Man, be put to the Account of the Parliament; which had defrauded them of tho&s;e &s;upplies, which, by his Maje&s;ties care, had been rai&s;ed, and provided for them; and not to his Maje&s;ty, who had done nothing but what he was obliged to do for his own pre&s;ervation; and if he had not &s;ent for tho&s;e Soldiers from <HI>Ireland,</HI> they could not have &s;tayed <MILESTONE N="10"> there without a &s;upply of Money, Cloaths, and Provi&s;ions; which the Parliament had not yet &s;ent to that part of the Army which remain'd there, and which could by no other way have &s;ub&s;i&s;ted, but by the be|nefit,&endq; and &s;ecurity of the Ce&s;&s;ation.</Q></P>
<P><Q>HE told them, &startq;that all this unju&s;tifiable way of proceeding, though it had compelled the King to yeild to a Ce&s;&s;ation, yet could not prevail with him to make a Peace with the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebels; from whom he had admitted Commi&s;&s;ioners to attend him with propo&s;itions to that pur|po&s;e; but that, when he found tho&s;e Propo&s;itions and Demands &s;o un|rea&s;onable, that he could not con&s;ent to them in Con&s;cience, and that <MILESTONE N="20"> they were incon&s;i&s;tent with the &s;ecurity of his Prote&s;tant Subjects there, he had totally rejected them, and di&s;mi&s;&s;ed their Commi&s;&s;ioners with &s;evere and &s;harp animadver&s;ions: yet that he had given his Lieute|nant, and Council there, authority to continue the Ce&s;&s;ation longer, in hope that the Rebels there, might be reduced to better temper; or that his Maje&s;ty might be enabl'd by a happy Peace here, which he hoped this Treaty would produce, to cha&s;ti&s;e their odious and ob&s;tinate Rebellion: And if the Parliament would yet give his Maje&s;ty &s;ufficient caution that the War &s;hall be vigorou&s;ly pro&s;ecuted there again&s;t the <HI>Iri&s;h,</HI> by &s;ending over &s;trong Supplies of Men, and Money, he would <MILESTONE N="30"> put an end to that Ce&s;&s;ation without declaring it to be void; which otherwi&s;e he could not in ju&s;tice do, and the doing whereof would be&endq; to no purpo&s;e.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE Commi&s;&s;ioners, vi&s;ibly out of Countenance and Angry, made no other reply, but &startq;that they were &s;orry to find, that odious and de|te&s;table Rebellion had received &s;o much Grace, as that Commi&s;&s;ioners from it had been admitted into the King's Pre&s;ence; and that they wondered, there &s;hould be any &s;cruple made of Declaring that Ce&s;&s;ation void, that was entered into expre&s;sly again&s;t the Letter of an Act of&endq; Parliament.</Q> This reply they gave in writing, with many pathetical expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the Murthers and Crueltys, that had been u&s;ed in the beginning of that Rebellion; which obliged the King's Commi&s;|&s;ioners to a little more &s;harpne&s;s in their returns than they were inclined to; and to tell them, <Q>&startq;that they wi&s;hed it were in the King's power to puni&s;h all Rebellion, with that &s;everity that was due to it; but &s;ince it was not &s;o, he mu&s;t conde&s;cend to Treaties, and to all other Expe|dients which are nece&s;&s;ary to reduce his Subjects who are in Rebellion,&endq; to return to their Duty and Obedience.</Q></P>
<P>THE nine fir&s;t days were now &s;pent upon the three great heads, in which there was little advance made towards giving &s;atisfaction to either Party; for though, in the matter of Religion, the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners had made &s;uch conde&s;cen&s;ions, as would oblige Bi&s;hops to be more di|ligent in Preaching, and to be them&s;elves pre&s;ent in the admini&s;tration
<PB N="456" REF="5200">
of the mo&s;t important parts of their Juri&s;diction; yet no &s;uch reforma|tion was con&s;iderable to tho&s;e who cared for nothing without extirpa|tion; and in neither of the other particulars any ground had been gotten; and they were &s;en&s;ible, that in the matter of <HI>Ireland,</HI> the King's defence would weigh down their Clamour and Calumny. There happen'd &s;ome Accidents in this time of the Treaty, which made impre&s;&s;ion on each Party; the fir&s;t was found in the looks of the Parliament Commi&s;&s;ioners, upon the Adverti&s;ement they receiv'd, that S^r <HI>Lewis Dives,</HI> who was Governour of a &s;mall Garri&s;on in <HI>Sherborne</HI> in <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> had from thence, in a Night, upon Intelligence with the King's Governour of <HI>Port|land-</HI>Ca&s;tle, &s;urpri&s;ed <HI>Weymouth,</HI> a Sea Port po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Parliament; <MILESTONE N="10"> which was like to be attended with great benefit to the King.</P>
<P>BUT whil&s;t the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners entertain'd &s;ome hope that this lo&s;s might have the more di&s;po&s;ed the Parliament to a ju&s;t Peace, they receiv'd Adverti&s;ement of a much greater lo&s;s &s;u&s;tain'd by the King, and which was more like to exalt the other &s;ide: Colonel <HI>Langhorn,</HI> and <HI>Mitton,</HI> two very Active Officers in the Parliament Service, about <HI>Shrop&s;hire</HI> and North <HI>Wales,</HI> by corre&s;pondence with &s;ome Town&s;men, and &s;ome Soldiers in the Garri&s;on of <HI>Shrewsbury,</HI> from whence too many of that Garri&s;on were unhappily drawn out, two or three days before, upon &s;ome expedition, &s;ei&s;ed upon that Town in the Night; <MILESTONE N="20"> and, by the &s;ame Treachery, likewi&s;e enter'd the Ca&s;tle; where S^r <HI>Mi|chael Earnly</HI> the Governour had been long &s;ick, and ri&s;ing, upon the Alarm, out of his Bed, was killed in his Shirt; whil&s;t he behaved him|&s;elf as well as was po&s;&s;ible; and refu&s;ed Quarter; which did not &s;horten his Life many days, he being even at the point of death by a Con&s;um|ption; which kept him from performing all tho&s;e Offices of Vigilance he was accu&s;tom'd to, being a Gallant Gentleman, who under&s;tood the Office and Duty of a Soldier by long experience, and diligent ob&s;er|vation. The lo&s;s of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> was a great blow to the King, and <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;treighten'd his Quarters exceedingly, and broke the &s;ecure Line of Communication with <HI>Che&s;ter,</HI> and expo&s;ed all North <HI>Wales, Hereford,</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> to the daily inroads of the Enemy: and the News of this, recover'd the dejected Spirits of the Parliament Commi&s;&s;ioners at <HI>Uxbridge.</HI></P>
<P>YET there had been an odd Accident which accompanied the Enter|pri&s;e upon <HI>Weymouth,</HI> which gave them afterwards more trouble. S^r <HI>Lewis Dives</HI> had, in his March from <HI>Sherborne,</HI> intercepted a Packet of Letters &s;ent out of <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire</HI> to the Parliament; and among tho&s;e, there was a Letter from <HI>John Pyne,</HI> a Gentleman well known, and of a fair E&s;tate in that Country, to Colonel <HI>Edward Popham,</HI> a principal Officer of the Parliament in their Fleets at Sea, and of a pa&s;|&s;ionate and virulent temper, of the Independent Party. The Subject of the Letter was a bitter invective again&s;t the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and all tho&s;e who advanced the Treaty of Peace, and a great dete&s;tation of the Peace, with very indecent expre&s;&s;ions again&s;t the King him&s;elf, and all who adhered to him.

<P>THE Conver&s;ation that this Letter occa&s;ion'd between &s;ome of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of both &s;ides, who in private u&s;ed their old freedom, made a great di&s;covery of the Faction that was in the Parliament: that there were many who de&s;ired to have Peace, without any alteration in the Government, &s;o they might be &s;ure of Indemnity, and &s;ecurity for what was pa&s;t; that the <HI>Scots</HI> would in&s;i&s;t upon the whole Government of the Church, and in all other Matters would defer to the King; but that there was another Party, that would have no Peace upon what con|ditions &s;oever, who did re&s;olve to change the whole frame of the Go|vernment in State, as well as Church; which made a great Party in the Army: all tho&s;e of the Parliament who de&s;ired to remove the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> from being General of the Army, and to make another General, were of that Party. There was likewi&s;e, among the Commi&s;&s;ioners <MILESTONE N="$$"> them&s;elves, very little tru&s;t, and communication; $$ <HI>Harry Vane, Saint John,</HI> and <HI>Prideaux,</HI> being, upon the matter, but Spies upon the re&s;t; and though mo&s;t of the re&s;t did heartily de&s;ire a Peace, even upon any terms, yet none of them had the Courage to avow the receding from the mo&s;t extravagant demand. Be&s;ides, there was rea&s;on enough to be|lieve, that, if the King had yeilded to all that was then propo&s;ed, they would likewi&s;e have in&s;i&s;ted upon all which they had formerly demanded, and upon the delivery up of all tho&s;e Per&s;ons who had faithfully &s;erv'd the King, and had been by them allways excepted, as Per&s;ons never to be pardon'd.</P>
<P>FOR though they had a&s;&s;ign'd tho&s;e three general heads, of the Church, of the Militia, and of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to be fir&s;t treated upon, which were all plau&s;ible and popular Arguments, and in which they who mo&s;t de&s;ired Peace, would in&s;i&s;t at lea&s;t upon many conde&s;cen&s;ions, yet they had not, in the lea&s;t degree, declined any other of their Propo&s;itions; as the exemption of many of the greate&s;t Quality, or of the mo&s;t de|clared Affections to the King, in the three Nations of <HI>England, Scotland,</HI> and <HI>Ireland,</HI> from Pardon; and the making the E&s;tates of the re&s;t, un|der the Name of Delinquents, liable to pay the Charges of the War; from which, or any of the other very unrea&s;onable demands, the Hou&s;es had not in their In&s;tructions given their Commi&s;&s;ioners Authority, in the lea&s;t particle, to recede: They who de&s;ired Peace, being &s;atisfied, that they had prevail'd to have a Treaty, which they imagin'd would do all the re&s;t, and that the&s;e le&s;&s;er demands, would fall off, of them&s;elves, when &s;atisfaction &s;hould be given in tho&s;e important particulars, which more concern'd the publick; and, on the other &s;ide, they who re&s;olv'd the Treaty &s;hould be ineffectual, were well content, that their Commi&s;|&s;ioners &s;hould be in&s;tructed only to in&s;i&s;t upon tho&s;e three Generals, without power to depart from any one expre&s;&s;ion, in the Propo&s;itions concerning tho&s;e particulars; being &s;atisfied, that in the particular which concern'd the Church, the <HI>Scots</HI> would never depart from a tittle; and as &s;ure, that the King would never yeild to it; and that, in the Militia, they who mo&s;t de&s;ired Peace, would adhere to that which mo&s;t concern'd

their own Security; and in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Ireland,</HI> be&s;ides the oppor|tunity to a&s;per&s;e the King, upon an Argument in which the People ge|nerally concurr'd with them, they were &s;afe enough; except the King &s;hould ab&s;olutely retract, and recant all that he had done, and by de|claring the Ce&s;&s;ation void, expo&s;e all tho&s;e who had a hand in it, to Their cen&s;ure, and judgement; and &s;o di&s;&s;olve all the Authority he had in that Kingdom for the future; which they knew he would never do. So that they were &s;afe enough in tho&s;e three heads of their Treaty, without bringing any of their other demands into Debate; which would have &s;pent much time, and rai&s;ed great difference in opinion among them; yet they <MILESTONE N="10"> had tho&s;e &s;till in re&s;erve, and might rea&s;onably conclude, that if the King &s;atisfied them in the Terms of tho&s;e three Propo&s;itions, he would never in&s;i&s;t upon any of the re&s;t; which could not relate &s;o much to his Con|&s;cience, or his Honour, as the other. Be&s;ides, they knew well, that, if, by the King's Conde&s;cen&s;ions, they had full &s;atisfaction in the former Three, they who had mo&s;t pa&s;&s;ion for Peace, would, for their own &s;hares in the particular revenge upon tho&s;e Men with whom they were angry enough, and in the preferments, which would be then in their di&s;po&s;al, never divide from them in any thing that remain'd to be demanded.</P>
<P>ONE Night, late, the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> came to the Chancellor of <MILESTONE N="20"> the Exchequer's Lodging, to return him a vi&s;it; and &s;ate with him &s;ome hours; all his di&s;cour&s;e being to per&s;wade him, to think it rea&s;onable to con&s;ent to all that the Parliament had demanded. <Q>He told him, &startq;that there was never &s;uch a Pack of Knaves, and Villaines, as they who now govern'd in the Parliament; who would &s;o far prevail, if this Treaty were broke off, as to remove the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> and then they would con&s;titute &s;uch an Army as &s;hould force the Parliament, as well as the King, to con&s;ent to what&s;oever they demanded; which would end in&endq; the Change of the Government into a Common-wealth.</Q> <Q>The Chancellor told him, &startq;if he believ'd That, it was high time for the Lords to look&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> about them, who would be then no le&s;s concern'd than the King.</Q> <Q>He confe&s;&s;ed it, and &startq;that they were now &s;en&s;ible, that they had brought this mi&s;chief upon them&s;elves; and did heartily repent it, though too late; and when they were, in no degree, able to prevent the general de&s;truction, which they fore&s;aw: but, if the King would be &s;o gracious to them, as to pre&s;erve them, by con&s;enting to tho&s;e unrea&s;onable Pro|po&s;itions which were made by the Parliament, the other wicked Per|&s;ons would be di&s;appointed by &s;uch his conce&s;&s;ions; the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> would &s;till keep his power; and they &s;hould be able, in a &s;hort time after the Peace concluded, by adhering to the King, whom they would never for&s;ake hereafter, to recover all for him that he now parted with, and <MILESTONE N="40"> to drive the&s;e wicked Men, who would de&s;troy Monarchy, out of the&endq; Kingdom;</Q> and then his Maje&s;ty would be greater than ever. How ex|travagant &s;oever this di&s;cour&s;e &s;eems to be, the matter of it was the &s;ame, which the wi&s;e&s;t of the re&s;t, and there were Men of very good parts among them, did &s;eriou&s;ly urge to other of the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners, with whom they had the &s;ame confidence: &s;o broken they were in their Spirits, and &s;o corrupted in their Under&s;tanding, even when they had their own ruin in their View.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Northumberland,</HI> who was the proude&s;t Man alive, could not look upon the De&s;truction of Monarchy, and the contempt the No|bility was already reduced to, and which mu&s;t be then encrea&s;ed, with any plea&s;ure: yet the repul&s;e he had formerly receiv'd at <HI>Oxford,</HI> upon

his Addre&s;&s;es thither, and the fair e&s;cape he had made afterwards from the jealou&s;y of the Parliament, had wrought &s;o far upon him, that he re&s;olv'd no more to depend upon the one, or to provoke the other, and was willing to &s;ee the King's Power and Authority &s;o much re&s;train'd, that he might not be able to do him any harm.</P>
<P>THE Earls of <HI>Pembroke,</HI> and <HI>Salisbury,</HI> were &s;o totally without credit, or intere&s;t in the Parliament, or Country, that it was no matter which way Their inclinations or affections di&s;po&s;ed them; and their Fear of the Faction that prevailed, was &s;o much greater than their Hatred towards them, that though they wi&s;hed They might rather be de&s;troy'd than the <MILESTONE N="10"> King, they had rather the King and his Po&s;terity &s;hould be de&s;troy'd, than that <HI>Wilton</HI> &s;hould be taken from the one of them, or <HI>Hatfeild</HI> from the other; the pre&s;ervation of both which from any danger, they both be|liev'd to be the highe&s;t point of prudence, and politick circum&s;pection.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Denbigh</HI> had much greater parts, and &s;aw farther before him into the de&s;perate de&s;igns of that Party that had then the power, than either of the other three, and dete&s;ted tho&s;e de&s;igns as much as any of them; yet the pride of his Nature, not inferior to the proude&s;t, and the con&s;cience of his Ingratitude to the King, in &s;ome re&s;pects &s;uperior to Theirs who had been mo&s;t obliged, kept him from being willing to <MILESTONE N="20"> quit the Company with whom he had conver&s;ed too long. Though he had receiv'd from them mo&s;t &s;ignal Affronts and Indignities, and well knew he &s;hould never more be employ'd by them, yet he thought the King's condition to be utterly de&s;perate, and that he would be at la&s;t compell'd to yeild to wor&s;e conditions than were now offer'd to him. He conferr'd with &s;o much freedom with one of the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners, and &s;pent &s;o much time with him in the vacant hours, there having been formerly a great Friend&s;hip between them, that he drew &s;ome jealou&s;y upon him|&s;elf from &s;ome of his Companions. With Him he lamented his own con|dition, and acknowledged his di&s;loyalty to the King, with expre&s;&s;ions of <MILESTONE N="30"> great compunction; <Q>and prote&s;ted, &startq;that he would mo&s;t willingly redeem his Tran&s;gre&s;&s;ions by any attempt that might &s;erve the King fignally, though he were &s;ure to lo&s;e his Life in it; but that to lo&s;e Him&s;elf, with|out any benefit to the King, would expo&s;e him to all mi&s;ery; which he&endq; would decline, by not &s;eparating from his Party.</Q> He inform'd him more fully of the wicked purpo&s;es of tho&s;e who then govern'd the Parliament, than others apprehended or imagin'd; and had a full pro&s;pect of the vile condition Him&s;elf, and all the Nobility &s;hould be reduced to; yet thought it impo&s;&s;ible to prevent it, by any Authority of their own; <Q>and con|cluded, &startq;that if any conjuncture fell out, in which, by lo&s;ing his Life, <MILESTONE N="40"> he might pre&s;erve the King, he would embrace the Occa&s;ion; other|wi&s;e,&endq; he would &s;hift the be&s;t he could for him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>OF the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the Hou&s;e of Commons, though, the three named before being excepted, the re&s;t did in their hearts de&s;ire a Peace, and upon much hone&s;ter conditions than they dur&s;t own; yet there were not two of them who had entire confidence in each other, or who dur&s;t communicate their thoughts together: &s;o that though they could &s;peak their minds freely enough, &s;everally, to tho&s;e Commi&s;&s;ioners of the King's &s;ide with whom they had former friend&s;hip, they would not, in the pre|&s;ence of any of their own Companions, u&s;e that freedom. The Debate that had been in the Hou&s;e upon the <HI>Self-denying Ordinance,</HI> had rai&s;ed &s;o many Jealou&s;ies, and di&s;compo&s;ed the confidence that had formerly been between many of them, that they knew not what any Man intended to
<PB N="460" REF="5260">
do; many who had, from the beginning of the Troubles, profe&s;&s;ed to have mo&s;t devotion for the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and to abhor all his Enemies, had lately &s;eem'd to concur in that Ordinance, which was contrived principally for his di&s;honour and de&s;truction; and others who &s;eem'd &s;till to adhere to him, did it with &s;o many cautions, that there could be no confidence of their per&s;everance.</P>
<P>HOLLIS, who was the franke&s;t among them in owning his Animo&s;ity and Indignation again&s;t all the Independent Party, and was no otherwi&s;e affected to the Presbyterians, than as they con&s;tituted a Party upon which he depended to oppo&s;e the other, did fore&s;ee that many of tho&s;e who ap|peared <MILESTONE N="10"> mo&s;t re&s;olute to concur with him, would, by degrees, fall from him purely for want of Courage, in which he abounded. <HI>Whitlock,</HI> who, from the beginning, had concurr'd with them without any Inclinations to their Per&s;ons, or their Principles, had the &s;ame rea&s;on &s;till not to &s;e|parate from them. All his E&s;tate was in their Quarters, and he had a Na|ture that could not bear, or &s;ubmit to be undone: though to his Friends, who were Commi&s;&s;ioners for the King, he u&s;ed his old openne&s;s, and pro|fe&s;&s;ed his dete&s;tation of all the proceedings of his Party, yet could not leave them. <HI>Pierpoint,</HI> and <HI>Crew,</HI> who were both Men of great Fortunes, and had allways been of the greate&s;t moderation in their Coun&s;els, and <MILESTONE N="20"> mo&s;t &s;ollicitous upon all opportunities for Peace, appear'd now to have contracted more bitterne&s;s, and &s;ourne&s;s than formerly; and were more re&s;erv'd towards the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners, than was expected; <Q>and in all conferences in&s;i&s;ted peremptorily, &startq;that the King mu&s;t yeild to what|&s;oever&endq; was required in the three Demands, which had been Debated.</Q> <Q>They all valued them&s;elves &startq;upon having induced the Parliament, again&s;t all Oppo&s;ition, to con&s;ent to a Treaty; which producing no effect, they&endq; &s;hould hereafter have no more credit;</Q> and it plainly appear'd, that they had per&s;waded them&s;elves, that, in the Treaty, they &s;hould be able to per&s;wade the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners to concur with them; and that <MILESTONE N="30"> the King would yeild upon the very &s;ame argument, and expectation, that the Earl of <HI>Pembroke</HI> had offer'd to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.</P>
<P>SOME of them, who knew how impo&s;&s;ible it was to prevail with the Commi&s;&s;ioners, or, if They could be corrupted &s;o far in their judgements, how much more impo&s;&s;ible it would be to per&s;wade the King to con&s;ent to what was &s;o diametrically again&s;t his Con&s;cience, and his Honour; <Q>and, in truth, again&s;t his Security, did wi&s;h, &startq;that, to get the time of the Trea|ty prolonged, &s;ome Conce&s;&s;ions might be made in the point of the Mi|litia, in order to their &s;ecurity; which being provided for, might pro|bably take off many Per&s;ons, who, out of that con&s;ideration principally, adhered to tho&s;e who they thought were mo&s;t jealous of it, and mo&s;t&endq; &s;ollicitous for it.</Q> This &s;eem'd &s;uch an Expedient to tho&s;e to whom they propo&s;ed it, that they thought fit to make a Debate among all the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners about it; <Q>&startq;and if it &s;hould produce no other effect, than the getting more days to the Treaty, and making more Divi&s;ions in the Par|liament, both which they might naturally expect from it, the benefit was not &s;mall that would attend it; for, as long as the Treaty la&s;ted, there could be little advance made towards new modelling the Army, the delay whereof would give the King likewi&s;e more time to make His&endq; preparations for the Field;</Q> towards which he was in no forwardne&s;s. This con&s;ideration prevail'd with the Commi&s;&s;ioners to &s;end their opinion to the King, <Q>&startq;that he would give them leave to propo&s;e, when the next day came for the Debate of the point of the Militia, that the whole Mi
<PB N="461" REF="5270">
litia of the Kingdom &s;hould be &s;ettled in &s;uch a Number of Per&s;ons, for &s;even or eight years, who might be all &s;worn to the ob&s;ervation of all the Articles which &s;hould be agreed upon in the Treaty; after the expira|tion of which time, which would be &s;ufficient to extingui&s;h all jealou&s;ies,&endq; it &s;hould be re&s;tored to the King.</Q> And they &s;ent the King a Li&s;t of &s;uch Names, as they wi&s;hed might be in&s;erted in the Propo&s;ition, of Per&s;ons in credit with the Parliament, to which his Maje&s;ty might add the like Number of &s;uch, of who&s;e fidelity he was mo&s;t a&s;&s;ured.</P>
<P>THE Earls of <HI>E&s;&s;ex, Northumberland, Warwick,</HI> and <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> with <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> were among tho&s;e they recommended to be named by the King. With this Me&s;&s;age they &s;ent two of their own Body, who added other rea&s;ons, which they conceiv'd might prevail with him; and it was with great difficulty that his Maje&s;ty was prevailed with to con&s;ent, that &s;uch an Overture &s;hould be made. But being unwilling to di&s;&s;ent from his Commi&s;&s;ioners judgement, and believing it would be re|jected, and in hope that it would gain time by lengthning the Treaty, his Maje&s;ty was contented, that the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;hould make &s;uch an Offer as is mention'd, and name the Per&s;ons they had propo&s;ed of the Par|liament Party; and withall, he &s;ent a Li&s;t of &s;uch Per&s;ons as him&s;elf thought fit to tru&s;t in that Affair; in whom, together with the others, he would have the power of the Militia to be ve&s;ted. But by this time, the Term a&s;&s;ign'd for the Treaty drawing towards an end, they who had fir&s;t advi&s;ed this Expedient, had not the &s;ame opinion of the &s;ucce&s;s; and had plainly di&s;cover'd, that the Parliament would not con&s;ent to add one day more to the Treaty. So the farther pro&s;ecution of the Overture in that manner was laid a&s;ide. <Q>For the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners concluded, &startq;that at this time to offer any particular Names from the King to be tru&s;ted with the Militia, was but to expo&s;e tho&s;e Per&s;ons to reproach, as &s;ome of them were very ungracious and unpopular to them; and to give the other &s;ide an excu&s;e for rejecting the offer, upon exception to&endq; their Per&s;ons.</Q> However, that they might &s;ee a greater conde&s;cen&s;ion from the King in that point, than he had ever yet been induced to, they offer'd, <Q>&startq;that the Militia &s;hould be &s;o &s;ettled for the &s;pace of &s;even years, as they had de&s;ired, in &s;uch a Number of Per&s;ons as &s;hould be agreed upon; a moiety of which Per&s;ons, &s;hould be nominated by the King,&endq; and the other moiety by the Parliament: which was rejected by them with their u&s;ual Neglect.</Q></P>
<P>FROM this time the Commi&s;&s;ioners, on both &s;ides, grew more re&s;erv'd, and colder towards each other; in&s;omuch as in the la&s;t Conferences, the An&s;wers and Replies upon one another, were &s;harper and more reflecting than they had formerly been: and in their Conference upon the la&s;t day, which held mo&s;t part of the night, it was evident, either &s;ide labour'd mo&s;t to make the other &s;eem to be mo&s;t in fault. The King's Commi&s;&s;ioners deliver'd a Paper, which contain'd a Sum of all that had been done in the Treaty, and ob&s;erv'd, <Q>&startq;that after a War of &s;o many years, enter'd into, as was pretended, for the Defence, and Vindication of the Laws of the Land, and the Liberty of the Subject, in a Treaty of twenty days, they had not demanded any one thing, that, by the Law of the Land, they had the lea&s;t Title to demand; but in&s;i&s;ted only on &s;uch particulars as were again&s;t Law, and the e&s;tabli&s;hed Government of the Kingdom; and that much more had been offer'd to them for the obtaining of Peace,&endq; than they could with ju&s;tice or rea&s;on require: with which they were &s;o offended,</Q> that they, for &s;ome time, refu&s;ed to receive the Paper, upon
<PB N="462" REF="5280">
pretence, <Q>&startq;&endq; that the time for the Treaty was expired;</Q> becau&s;e it was then after twelve of the Clock of the Night of the twentieth day: but at la&s;t they were contented to receive it, finding, that it would not be le&s;s publick, and would more reflect upon them, if they rejected it: and &s;o they parted, a little before the break of day.</P>
<P>THE next day, being <HI>Sunday,</HI> they re&s;ted in the Town, that they might, <NOTE PLACE="marg">The end of the Treaty with|out effect.</NOTE> in the afternoon, decently take their leaves of each other; though <HI>Mon|day,</HI> according to the Letter of their Pa&s;s, was the la&s;t day of their free|dom, and at that Sea&s;on of the year their Journey to <HI>Oxford</HI> might require two days, as they had &s;pent two days in coming thither; and the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners <MILESTONE N="10"> for the Parliament, had given them a Paper in which they de|clared, <Q>&startq;that they might &s;afely make u&s;e of another day for their return,&endq; of which no Advantage &s;hould be taken.</Q> But they having on <HI>Sunday,</HI> perform'd their mutual Vi&s;its to each other, parted with &s;uch coolne&s;s towards each other, as if they &s;carce hoped to meet again; and the King's Commi&s;&s;ioners were &s;o unwilling to run any hazard, that they were on the <HI>Monday</HI> morning &s;o early in their Coaches, that they came to <HI>Oxford</HI> that night, and ki&s;s'd the King's hand; who receiv'd them very graciou&s;ly; thanking them for the pains they had taken. Surely the pains they had taken, with how little &s;ucce&s;s &s;oever, was very great; and they who had <MILESTONE N="20"> been mo&s;t inured to bu&s;ine&s;s, had not in their lives ever undergone &s;o great fatigue for twenty days together, as at that Treaty. The Commi&s;|&s;ioners &s;eldom parted, during that whole time, till two or three of the Clock in the morning. Be&s;ides, They were obliged to &s;it up later who were to prepare &s;uch Papers as were directed for the next day, and to write Letters to <HI>Oxford;</HI> &s;o that, if the Treaty had continued much longer, it is very probable many of the Commi&s;&s;ioners mu&s;t have fallen &s;ick for want of &s;leep; which &s;ome of them were not &s;atisfied with in three or four days after their return to <HI>Oxford.</HI> Thus ended the Treaty of <HI>Ux|bridge,</HI> the Particulars whereof were, by the King's Command, &s;hortly af|ter <MILESTONE N="30"> publi&s;hed in print, and never contradicted by the Parliament.</P>
<P>THE King &s;poke to tho&s;e he tru&s;ted mo&s;t at that time, with much more Melancholy of his own condition, and the State of his Affairs, than he had u&s;ed to do. The lo&s;s of <HI>Shrewsbury</HI> was attended with many ill con&s;equences; and that which had &s;eem'd to bring &s;ome kind of recom|pence for it, the Surpri&s;e of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> prov'd but a Dream; for the Enemy had lo&s;t but one part of the Town, which they, in a &s;hort time af|ter, recover'd again by the u&s;ual Negligence of the King's Governours. <Q>So that his Maje&s;ty told them, &startq;he found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to pur&s;ue his former re&s;olution of &s;eparating the Prince his Son from him&s;elf, that <MILESTONE N="$$"> the Enemy might not, upon any Succe&s;s, find them together; which, he &s;aid, would be ruin to them both; whereas, though he &s;hould fall into their hands whil&s;t his Son was at liberty, they would not dare to&endq; do him harm.</Q> He &s;eem'd to have very rea&s;onable Apprehen&s;ions, that upon the lo&s;s of a Battle, he might become a Pri&s;oner; but he never ima|gin'd, that it would enter into their thoughts to take away his Life; not that he believ'd they could be re&s;train'd from that impious Act, by any remor&s;e of Con&s;cience, or that they had not wickedne&s;s enough to de&s;ign and execute it: but he believ'd it again&s;t their Intere&s;t; <Q>and would often in di&s;cour&s;e, &s;ay, &startq;of what moment the pre&s;ervation of his Life was to the Rebels; and how much they were concern'd to pre&s;erve it, in re+gard, that if the Him&s;elf were dead, the Parliament &s;tood di&s;&s;olv'd; $$&endq; that there would be an end of their Government: which, though

were true in Law, would have little &s;haken their Power, of which they were too long po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed to part with it ea&s;ily.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was a &s;peculation of that Nature, that Nobody had rea&s;on to en|deavour to change the King's opinion in that particular; and his Maje&s;ty thought of nothing &s;o much as ha&s;tning the Prince's Journey; and to that purpo&s;e, commanded tho&s;e who were appointed to attend him to be ready by a &s;hort day, re&s;olving that his Highne&s;s &s;hould make his journey di|rectly to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and continue his re&s;idence there, till &s;ome emergent al|teration &s;hould make his remove from thence nece&s;&s;ary. For whatever di&s;cour&s;e was made of rai&s;ing an Army in the We&s;t, the King had no purpo&s;e to put the Prince into the head of any &s;uch Army; and though <HI>Goring</HI> had prevail'd to be &s;ent, with a &s;trong party of Hor&s;e, and &s;ome Foot, into <HI>Ham&s;hire,</HI> upon pretence of &s;ecuring the We&s;t from <HI>Waller</HI>'s Incur&s;ion, and upon &s;ome other de&s;ign; yet the King had not the lea&s;t purpo&s;e, that he &s;hould be where the Prince was; though he was not him&s;elf without that de&s;ign at that pre&s;ent, as &s;hall be made out anon, meaning by that device to withdraw him&s;elf from the Command of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> which the King did not apprehend. But his Maje&s;ty hav|ing no more in his purpo&s;e than is &s;aid before, he &s;ent the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> to <HI>Bristol</HI> to provide a Hou&s;e for his Highne&s;s, and to $ut that City into as good a po&s;ture of Security for the Prince's Re&s;idence, as was nece&s;&s;ary; nor was there any other Strength de&s;igned to attend about his Highne&s;s's Per&s;on, than one Regiment of Hor&s;e, and one Regiment of Foot, for his Guards, both to be under the Command of the Lord <HI>Capel;</HI> who was like|wi&s;e to rai&s;e them upon his own Credit and Intere&s;t; there being, at that time, not one Man rais'd of Hor&s;e or Foot, nor any means in view for the payment of them, when they &s;hould be rai&s;ed; nor, indeed, for the &s;up|port of the Prince's Family, or his Per&s;on. In &s;o great &s;carcity, and po|verty, was the King him&s;elf, and his Court at <HI>Oxford.</HI></P>
<P>THERE happen'd an Accident at this time, that reconcil'd the minds of many to this Journey of the Prince into the We&s;t, and looked like a good Omen that it would produce good effects; though it prov'd after|wards an occa&s;ion of much trouble and inconvenience. When the King return'd through <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> after the defeat of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> there had been a Petition deliver'd to him, in the Names of the Gentry, Clergy, Freeholders, and others his Maje&s;ties Prote&s;tant Subjects of the County of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> in which they de&s;ired, <Q>&startq;that his Maje&s;ty would give them leave to Petition the Parliament, that there might be a Treaty for Peace; and that they might have liberty to wait upon his Maje&s;ty in Per&s;on in his march; and that when they came to a nearer di&s;tance, they might then go before, and deliver their Petition; and if they &s;hould not obtain their &s;o ju&s;t Reque&s;t, they would then a&s;&s;i&s;t his Maje&s;ty to get that by the Sword, which could be obtain'd no other&endq; way.</Q> <Q>To that purpo&s;e, they de&s;ir'd leave &startq;to put them&s;elves in Arms,&endq; to attend his Maje&s;ty in the Journey.</Q> This Petition, how indige&s;ted, or impracticable &s;oever in the manner, and way propo&s;ed, was contriv'd by &s;ome Per&s;ons of unque&s;tionable Fidelity to the King; who thought, that under this &s;pecious Title of Petitioners for Peace, they might draw even that whole populous County to appear for the King; and therefore the King gave them a gracious reception, and liberty to do all that they de|&s;ired; believing it po&s;&s;ible, that he might even from thence recruit his Foot; which he mo&s;t de&s;ired. But his Maje&s;ties &s;peedy march, left that de&s;ign to be better weighed and dige&s;ted.</P>

UPON the fir&s;t Fame of the Prince's being to vi&s;it the We&s;t, and to keep his Court there, &s;ome Gentlemen, of the be&s;t Quality in the We&s;t, came to <HI>Oxford,</HI> as entru&s;ted by the re&s;t to acquaint his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;that they had now form'd the De&s;ign, they had formerly pre&s;ented to him, much better than it was; and that the four We&s;tern Counties, <HI>Dor&s;et, Somer&s;et, Devon,</HI> and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> had re&s;olv'd to enter into an A&s;&s;ocia|tion, and to be joynt Petitioners to the Parliament for Peace; and that their Petition &s;hould be &s;ent by very many thou&s;ands of the mo&s;t &s;ub|&s;tantial Freeholders of the &s;everal Counties, who &s;hould have money enough in their pur&s;es to defray their Charges, going and returning; <MILESTONE N="10"> and who&s;oever refu&s;ed to joyn in the Petition, &s;hould be looked upon as Enemies to Peace and their Country, and accordingly treated; &s;o that this Addre&s;s could not but have great influence upon the Parliament, being under the Style of One and All; and could not but be looked upon&endq; as &s;uch.</Q> <Q>They de&s;ir'd the King, &startq;that the Prince might be made General of this A&s;&s;ociation; in order to which, they would provide for his &s;up|port according to his Dignity; and, in the fir&s;t place, take care for the&endq; rai&s;ing a good Guard of Hor&s;e and Foot, for the &s;afety of his Per&s;on.</Q></P>
<P>THOUGH this de&s;ign, in the Notions thereof, was as unpracticable as the former, yet his Maje&s;ty thought not fit to di&s;countenance, and re|ject <MILESTONE N="20"> it. It was very vehemently pre&s;&s;ed by many Per&s;ons of Quality, in the name of the four We&s;tern Counties, and among tho&s;e who took it mo&s;t to heart, S^r <HI>John Stawel</HI> was the Chief; a Gentelman of one of the large&s;t E&s;tates, that any Man po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed in the We&s;t, who had, from the beginning of the Parliament, &s;hew'd very great Affection to the Per&s;on of the King, and to the Government that was &s;ettled, both in Church and State; and from the beginning of the War had engaged both his own Per&s;on, and his two Sons, in the mo&s;t active part of it, with &s;ingular Courage; and had rendered him&s;elf as odious to the Parliament, as any Man of that condition had done. This Gentleman, was a&s;&s;i&s;ted, and coun|&s;el'd <MILESTONE N="30"> by M^r <HI>Fountain,</HI> a Lawyer of eminency, who had been impri&s;oned, and bani&s;hed <HI>London,</HI> for his declar'd affection to the Crown; and they two had fir&s;t entertain'd and form'd this project in their own thoughts, and then, upon the communication of it with &s;ome Gentlemen, and more of the Farmers, and Freeholders of the County, found &s;uch a general concur|rence with them, that they concluded it could not but have good Suc|ce&s;s, and would bring the Parliament to be glad of Peace. They were both very tenacious of what they had once re&s;olv'd, and believ'd all who objected again&s;t their undertaking to be aver&s;e from Peace; &s;o that the King concluded, that he would &s;o far comply with them, as to make the <MILESTONE N="40"> Prince General of their A&s;&s;ociation; which he was &s;ure could do no harm; and they were &s;o much delighted with the conde&s;cen&s;ion, that they pro|mi&s;ed &s;peedily to make Provi&s;ion for the Prince's &s;upport, and for the rai&s;|ing his Guards of Hor&s;e and Foot; and to that purpo&s;e made ha&s;t to <HI>Bri|&s;tol,</HI> that all things might be ready again&s;t the Prince came thither.</P>
<P>UPON the&s;e rea&s;ons, the Prince had two Commi&s;&s;ions granted to him; one, to be General of the A&s;&s;ociation; and another, to be General <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>made General of the King's Forces, and of the We&s;tern A&s;&s;o|ciation.</HI></NOTE> of all the King's Forces in <HI>England.</HI> For when the King declared his Ne|phew Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> to be General, in the Place of the Earl of <HI>Brentford,</HI> his Highne&s;s de&s;ired, <Q>&startq;that there might be no General in <HI>England</HI> but <MILESTONE N="50"> the Prince of <HI>Wales,</HI> and that he might receive his Commi&s;&s;ion from&endq; Him;</Q> which his Maje&s;ty took well; and &s;o that Commi&s;&s;ion of Ge|nerali&s;&s;imo was likewi&s;e given to the Prince, when in truth it was re&s;olv'd

<P>THE Indi&s;po&s;ition and Melancholy which po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Court at <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> and all the King's Party, was pre&s;erv'd from de&s;pair, only by the ex|traordinary di&s;contents and animo&s;ities in the Parliament; which kept them from pur&s;uing the advantages they had had by united Coun&s;els. A&s;|&s;oon as the Commi&s;&s;ioners were return'd from <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> and that a Trea|ty could be now no farther urged, the Independent Party (for &s;o they were now contented to be call'd, in oppo&s;ition to the other which was &s;tyled Presbyterian) appear'd bare faced, and vigorou&s;ly pre&s;&s;ed on their <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>Self-denying Ordinance,</HI> that &s;o they might proceed towards modelling their new Army, by putting out the old Officers; during the &s;u&s;pen&s;ion whereof, there was no care for providing for the Troops they had, or making recruits, or preparing any of tho&s;e Provi&s;ions, which would be nece&s;&s;ary for taking the Field. They were now enter'd into the Month of <HI>March,</HI> which was u&s;ed as a &s;trong Argument by both Parties, the one urging, <Q>&startq;from the Sea&s;on of the year, the nece&s;&s;ity of expediting their re&s;olution for the pa&s;&s;ing the Ordinance, that the Army might be put&endq; into a po&s;ture of marching;</Q> the other pre&s;&s;ing, <Q>&startq;that &s;o great an Altera|tion ought not to be attempted, when there was &s;o &s;hort a time to make <MILESTONE N="20"> it in: That there would be apparent danger, that the Enemy would&endq; find them, without any Army at all fit to take the Field;</Q> and therefore de&s;ired, <Q>&startq;that all things might &s;tand as they were, till the end of the next&endq; Campagne;</Q> when, if they &s;aw cau&s;e, they might re&s;ume this Expedient. The other Party were loud again&s;t the delay; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;that was the way to make the War la&s;t; for managed as it had been, they &s;hould be found at the end of the next Campagne in the &s;ame po&s;ture they were now in; whereas they made no doubt but, if this Ordinance was pa&s;s'd, they &s;hould proceed &s;o vigorou&s;ly, that the next Campagne &s;hould put an&endq; end to the War.</Q> <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>THE Debate continued many days in the Hou&s;e of Commons, with much pa&s;&s;ion, and &s;harp reflections upon Things, and Per&s;ons; whil&s;t the Hou&s;e of Peers look'd on, and attended the re&s;olution below. Of the Pres|byterian Party, which pa&s;&s;ionately oppo&s;ed the Ordinance, the chief were, <HI>Hollis, Stapleton, Glin, Waller, Long,</HI> and others, who believ'd their Party much Superior in Number; as the Independent Party was led by <HI>Na|thaniel Fiennes, Vane, Cromwell, Ha&s;lerig, Martin,</HI> and others; who &s;poke more and warmer than they that oppo&s;ed them. Of the Hou&s;e of Peers, there was none thought to be of this la&s;t Party, but the Lord <HI>Say;</HI> all the re&s;t were &s;uppo&s;ed to be of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Party; and &s;o, that it <MILESTONE N="40"> was impo&s;&s;ible that the Ordinance &s;hould ever pa&s;s in the Hou&s;e of Peers, though it &s;hould be carried by the Commons: But they were in This, as in many other things, di&s;appointed; for many, who had &s;ate &s;ilent, and been thought to have been of one Party, appear'd to be of the other. They who thought they could never be &s;ecure in any Peace, except the King were fir&s;t at their Mercy, and &s;o obliged to accept the conditions They would give him, were willing to change the hand in carrying on the War&punc; and Many, who thought the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> behaved him&s;elf too im|periou&s;ly, were willing to have the Command in one who was more their equal. Many were willing he &s;hould be anger'd, and humbled, that Him|&s;elf <MILESTONE N="50"> might be more concern'd to advance a Peace, which he had not been forward enough to do, whil&s;t he held the Supreme Command.</P>
<P>WHEN the Debate grew ripe, <HI>Saint John, Pierpoint, Whitlock,</HI> and <HI>Crew,</HI> who had been thought to be of the Party of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> ap|pear'd

<P>AFTER the Battle at <HI>York,</HI> and that the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter</HI> was re|quir'd to march with his Army again&s;t the King, upon the defeat of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army marched Northwards, to re|duce the little Garri&s;ons remaining in tho&s;e parts; which was ea&s;ily done. After which they marched to <HI>New-Ca&s;tle;</HI> which, being defended only by the Town&s;men, and in no degree fortified for a Siege, was given up to <MILESTONE N="20"> them, after as good a re&s;i&s;tance as could be made in &s;uch a place, and by &s;uch People. So that they having no more to do in tho&s;e parts, the Par|liament thought not fit however to di&s;mi&s;s them to return into their own Country, not knowing yet, how far their new modell'd Army would be able to carry on all their de&s;igns. And therefore the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army was again advanced as far as <HI>York,</HI> and was to be applied as there &s;hould be occa&s;ion.</P>
<P>THE King had formerly, towards the end of the year forty three, con|&s;ider'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An account of the Earl of</HI> Mountro&s;e<HI>'s Expedition into</HI> Scotland.</NOTE> how to give &s;uch a di&s;turbance to <HI>Scotland,</HI> as might oblige their Army to &s;tay at home to quench a fire in their own Country; but all the Advance, which had been made towards the execution of that de&s;ign, in <MILESTONE N="30"> the Conferences with the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> and in the Commitment of Duke <HI>Hamilton,</HI> had been check'd for &s;ome time, by the King's not being able to give any Troops to that Earl, by the Protection whereof the loyal Party of that Kingdom might come to his A&s;&s;i&s;tance, and di&s;cover their Affection to his Maje&s;ty. Notwith&s;tanding which, the vigorous &s;pirit of the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> had &s;tirr'd him up to make &s;ome attempt, whether he had any help or no. The Per&s;on whom that Earl mo&s;t hated, and con|temn'd, was the Marquis of <HI>Argyle,</HI> who had then the Chief Government of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and though he was a Man endued with all the faculties of craft and di&s;&s;imulation, that were nece&s;&s;ary to bring great de&s;igns to ef|fect, <MILESTONE N="40"> and had, in re&s;pect of his E&s;tate and Authority, a very great In|tere&s;t in that Kingdom; yet he had no Martial Qualities, nor the repu|tation of more Courage, than in&s;olent and imperious Per&s;ons, whil&s;t they meet with no oppo&s;ition, are u&s;ed to have.</P>
<P>THE Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> believ'd that his getting &s;afely into <HI>Scotland,</HI> was much more difficult than it would be to rai&s;e Men enough there to controul the Authority of <HI>Argyle.</HI> There was, at that time, at <HI>Oxford,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Antrim,</HI> remarkable for nothing, but for having Married the Dowager of the great Duke of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> within few years after the death of that Favourite.

The Earl of <HI>Antrim,</HI> who was a Man of exce&s;&s;ive pride and vanity, and of a very weak and narrow under&s;tanding, was no &s;ooner without the coun&s;el and company of his <MILESTONE N="10"> Wife, than he betook him&s;elf to the Rebels, with an imagination that his Quality and Fortune would give him the &s;upreme power over them; which, probably, he never intended to employ to the prejudice of the King, but de&s;ired to appear &s;o con&s;iderable, that he might be look'd upon as a greater Man than the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> which was &s;o unea&s;y and torturing an Ambition to him, that it led him into &s;everal faults and fol|lies. The Rebels were glad of His pre&s;ence, and to have his Name known to be among them, but had no confidence in his abilities to advi&s;e or com|mand them; but relied much more upon his Brother, <HI>Alexander Mac|donnel,</HI> who was fa&s;t to their Party, and in their mo&s;t &s;ecret Coun&s;els. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>THE Earl, according to his natural un&s;teadine&s;s, did not like his Sta|tion there, but, by di&s;gui&s;e, got him&s;elf into the Prote&s;tant Quarters, and from thence into <HI>England,</HI> and &s;o to <HI>Oxford;</HI> where his Wife then was, and made his pre&s;ence not unacceptable; the King not having then no|tice of his having ever been among the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebels; but he pretended to have great credit and power in <HI>Ireland</HI> to &s;erve the King, and to di&s;po&s;e the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> to a Peace, if he &s;hould have any countenance from the King; which his Maje&s;ty knew him too well to think him capable of.

the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> that he was thought to have credit enough in that part of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to perform a Service for the King, which he never be|fore entertain'd a thought of. <Q>So that he pre&s;ently undertook to the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> &startq;that, if the King would grant him a Commi&s;&s;ion, he would rai&s;e an Army in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and tran&s;port it into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and would him&s;elf be in the head of it; by means whereof he believ'd all the Clan of the <HI>Macdonnels</HI> in the Highlands of <HI>Scotland,</HI> might be per|&s;waded&endq; to follow him.</Q> When the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> had form'd &s;uch a rea&s;onable undertaking, as he believ'd the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> might in truth be able to comply with, he acquainted the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> with it, who was <MILESTONE N="10"> a friend to all difficult de&s;igns, and de&s;ired him <Q>&startq;to propo&s;e it to the King, and to let his Maje&s;ty know, that he was &s;o confident of the Earl of <HI>An|trim</HI>'s being able to perform what &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary (for he would be very well content, if he would &s;end over a Body but of two thou&s;and Men into <HI>Scotland,</HI> which he well knew he could ea&s;ily do) that he would him&s;elf be in the Highlands to receive them; and run his fortune with them; if his Maje&s;ty would give him leave to gather up &s;uch a Number of his Country-men about <HI>Oxford,</HI> as would be willing to accompany him; with whom he would make his way thither; and that, if no time were lo&s;t in pro&s;ecuting this de&s;ign, he did hope that by the time the <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Scotch</HI> Army &s;hould be ready to take the Field, they &s;hould receive &s;uch&endq; an Alarm from their own Country, as &s;hould hinder their advance.</Q></P>
<P>UPON this Overture, the King conferr'd with the two Earls together; and finding the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> forward to undertake the rai&s;ing as ma|ny Men as &s;hould be de&s;ired, if he might have the King's Commi&s;&s;ion to that purpo&s;e; and knowing well, that he had, in that part of the King|dom, Intere&s;t enough to do it; <Q>and the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> as confidently a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that with two thou&s;and Men landed in the High|lands, he would quickly rai&s;e an Army, with which he could di&s;quiet&endq; that Kingdom;</Q> and the de&s;ign being more probable, than any other <MILESTONE N="30"> that could be propo&s;ed to the &s;ame purpo&s;e, his Maje&s;ty re&s;olv'd to en|courage it all he could, that is, to give it countenance; for he had neither Money, nor Armes, nor Ammunition, to contribute to it in any degree. The great objection, <Q>that appear'd at the fir&s;t entrance into it was, &startq;that though the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> had power in <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> and among the Roman Catholicks, he was very odious to the Prote&s;tants, and obnoxious to the State at <HI>Dublin,</HI> many things being di&s;cover'd again&s;t him of his cor|re&s;pondence with the Rebels, which were not known when he came in|to&endq; <HI>England.</HI></Q> But that which gave mo&s;t Umbrage (for no body &s;u&s;pected his conjunction with the Rebels) <Q>&startq;was his declar'd Malice to the Lord <MILESTONE N="40"> Lieutenant, the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> and the contempt the Marquis had of him, who would therefore undervalue any Propo&s;ition &s;hould be made by him, being a Man of &s;o notorious a levity and incon&s;tancy, that he did not u&s;e to intend the &s;ame thing long. There could be no tru&s;ting him with any Commi&s;&s;ion independent upon the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> or allowing him to do any thing in <HI>Ireland</HI> without the Mar|quis's Privity, and &s;uch a limitation would by no means be grateful to him. And though the benefit, the King's Friends in <HI>Scotland</HI> would re|ceive by the carrying away any Body of Men out of <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> would be a great le&s;&s;ening and abatement of the &s;trength of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebels, who had the Command over tho&s;e parts, yet if the Earl of <HI>Antrim,</HI> un|der any Authority from the King, &s;hould indi&s;creetly behave him|&s;elf (as no Man who lov'd him be&s;t, had any confidence in his di&s;cre|tion) all the reproaches ca&s;t upon his Maje&s;ty, of his countenancing
<PB N="469" REF="5360">
&endq; tho&s;e Rebels, would receive the greate&s;t confirmation imaginable.</Q></P>
<P>THE fore&s;ight of the&s;e difficulties gave life to an Intrigue in the Court, which for &s;ome time had not &s;ucceeded. <HI>Daniel O Neile</HI> (who was in &s;ubtlety and under&s;tandingg much &s;uperior to the whole Nation of the old <HI>Iri&s;h)</HI> had long labour'd to be of the Bed-Chamber to the King. He was very well known to the Court, having &s;pent many years between that, and the Low Countries, the Winter Sea&s;on in the one, and the Sum|mer allways in the Army in the other; as good an Education towards advancement in the world, as that Age knew. He had a fair reputation in both Climates, having a competent Fortune of his own, to &s;upport <MILESTONE N="10"> him&s;elf without dependence, and a natural In&s;inuation, and Addre&s;s, which made him acceptable in the be&s;t Company. He was a great ob|&s;erver, and di&s;cerner of Mens Natures and Humours, and was very dex|terous in complyance where he found it u&s;eful. A&s;&s;oon as the Troubles begun in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he had, with the fir&s;t, the Command of a Troop of Hor&s;e; to which he was by all Men held very equal; having had good ex|perience in the mo&s;t Active Armies of that time, and a Courage very no|torious. And though his inclinations were naturally to ea&s;e and luxury, his indu&s;try was indefatigable, when his honour required it, or his parti|cular intere&s;t, which he was never without, and to which he was very <MILESTONE N="20"> indulgent, made it nece&s;&s;ary or convenient.</P>
<P>IN the &s;econd Troubles in <HI>Scotland,</HI> he had a greater Command, and &s;ome part in mo&s;t of the Intrigues of the Court, and was in great con|fidence with tho&s;e who mo&s;t de&s;ign'd the de&s;truction of the Earl of <HI>Straf|ford;</HI> again&s;t whom he had contracted &s;ome prejudice in the behalf of his Nation: yet when the Parliament grew too imperious, he enter'd very frankly into tho&s;e new de&s;igns, which were contrived at Court, with le&s;s circum&s;pection than both the Sea&s;on, and the weight of the Affair required. And in this combination, in which Men were mo&s;t concern'd for them&s;elves, and to receive good recompence for the Adventures they made, he had either been promi&s;ed, or at lea&s;t encouraged by the Queen to hope to be made Groom of the Bed-Chamber, when a vacancy &s;hould happen. When the Civil War begun, he, being then in the Low Coun|tries, having made an e&s;cape out of the Tower, where he &s;tood com|mitted by the Parliament upon a Charge of High Trea&s;on, cho&s;e rather to be Lieutenant Colonel of Hor&s;e to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> than the Name of a greater Officer, which he might well have pretended to; pre&s;uming that, by his dexterity, he &s;hould have &s;uch an Intere&s;t in that young Prince, as might make his relation to him Superior to tho&s;e who had greater Titles. He had the misfortune, at the fir&s;t coming of the Prince, to have credit with him to make &s;ome impre&s;&s;ions, and prejudices, which he would have been glad afterwards to have removed, when he &s;aw others had credit likewi&s;e to build upon tho&s;e foundations, which he hoped to have had the &s;ole Authority to have &s;upervi&s;ed, and directed. When he &s;aw &s;ome of his Fraternity promoted to Offices and Honours, who had not ventur'd, or &s;uffer'd more than He (for if he had not made his e&s;cape out of the Tower very dextrou&s;ly, in a Ladies dre&s;s, he had been in manife&s;t danger of his Life) and who&s;e pretences were not bet|ter founded, than upon the promi&s;es made at the &s;ame time, when he had promi&s;ed him&s;elf to be of the Bed-Chamber, he now pre&s;&s;ed likewi&s;e to be admitted into that attendance; and the Queen had been very &s;olli|citous with the King on his behalf, being con&s;cious to her &s;elf, that he had been encouraged by Her to hope it. But the King could by no means be prevailed with to receive him, having contracted a prejudice again&s;t
<PB N="470" REF="5370">
him with reference to the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> or upon &s;ome other rea&s;on, which could not be removed by all his Friends, or by the Queen her &s;elf; who therefore bid him expect a better conjuncture. This, <HI>O Neile</HI> took very heavily; and the more, becau&s;e his condition in the Army was le&s;s plea&s;ant to him, by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s withdrawing his Graces from him.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ign of the Earls of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> and <HI>Antrim,</HI> which was yet wholely managed with the King by the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who was likewi&s;e of intimate Friend&s;hip with <HI>O Neile,</HI> gave him opportunity to &s;et this pretence again on foot. It was generally known that <HI>O Neile,</HI> whether <MILESTONE N="10"> by Alliance, or Friend&s;hip, or long acquaintance, had more power with the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> than any Man; and that by the a&s;cendent he had in his under&s;tanding, and the dexterity of his Nature, in which he was Su|perior to mo&s;t Men, he could per&s;wade him very much; and it was as notorious, that the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> lov'd <HI>O Neile</HI> very well, and had much e&s;teem for him. <Q>Upon this ground the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> told the King, &startq;that he had thought of an expedient, which he did believe might relieve him in the perplexities he &s;u&s;tain'd concerning the Conduct of the Earl&endq; of <HI>Antrim;</HI></Q> and then propo&s;ed, <Q>&startq;the &s;ending <HI>O Neile</HI> with him; who &s;hould fir&s;t di&s;&s;wade him from affecting to have any Commi&s;&s;ion Him|&s;elf <MILESTONE N="20"> to Act in <HI>Ireland;</HI> and then incline him to depend upon the A&s;|&s;i&s;tance and Authority of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> who &s;hould be re|quired by the King to contribute all he could, for the making tho&s;e Le|vies of Men, and for impre&s;&s;ing of Ships, and other Ve&s;&s;els for their Tran&s;portation into the Highlands; and then, that he &s;hould go over him&s;elf with the Earl, and &s;tay with him during his abode in <HI>Dublin;</HI> by which he might begin, and pre&s;erve a good Intelligence between Him, and the Marquis of <HI>Ormond;</HI> and di&s;po&s;e the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> to gratify him, in all things that might concern &s;o important a Ser|vice; which, be&s;ides the Letters he &s;hould carry with him from the <MILESTONE N="30"> King, his own credit with the Marquis, and his &s;ingular Addre&s;s,&endq; would ea&s;ily bring to pa&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Propo&s;ition was very agreeable to the King, who knew <HI>O Neile</HI> was equal to this bu&s;ine&s;; and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> did not in the lea&s;t in&s;i|nuate any de&s;ign for <HI>O Neile</HI>'s advantage in the Service, which would have diverted the Negotiation: thereupon his Maje&s;ty him&s;elf &s;poke to him of the whole de&s;ign, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> de&s;iring he would do &s;o, pre|tending that he had not communicated any part of it to him, being not &s;ure of his Maje&s;ties Approbation. <Q>He receiv'd it as a thing he had never thought of; and when the King asked him, &startq;whether he thought the <MILESTONE N="40"> Earl had intere&s;t enough in tho&s;e parts of <HI>Ireland,</HI> to Levy and Tran&s;|port&endq; a Body of Men into the Highlands?</Q> he An&s;wer'd readily, <Q>&startq;that he knew well, that there were &s;o many there, where the Earl's E&s;tate lay, who depended ab&s;olutely upon him, that there would be Men enough ready to go whither, or do what he required them; and that the Men were hardy and &s;tout for any Service; but the drawing a Bo|dy of them together, and Tran&s;porting them, would require, he doubt|ed,&endq; more power than the Earl him&s;elf had, or could be Ma&s;ter of.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;there were two Objections in view, and a third, that he was not&endq; willing, for many rea&s;ons, to make.</Q> <Q>The fir&s;t was, that nothing of that <MILESTONE N="50"> &startq;Nature could be done without the Authority and Power of the Mar|quis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> which, no doubt, would be applied to any purpo&s;e his Maje&s;ty &s;hould direct; yet that the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> had behaved him|&s;elf &s;o indi&s;creetly towards the Marquis, and &s;o unhand&s;omly di&s;obliged
<PB N="471" REF="5380">
him, that it could not but be the &s;evere&s;t Command his Maje&s;ty could lay upon the Marquis, to enter into any kind of conjunction, or con|ver&s;ation with that Earl. The &s;econd was, that, though the Earl's In|tere&s;t could make as many Men as he de&s;ired, to enter into any Action or Engagement he would pre&s;cribe, he much doubted the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Com|mander in Chief, who had the Military power of tho&s;e parts, would hardly permit a Body of tho&s;e Men, which they reckon'd their be&s;t Sol|diers,&endq; to be Tran&s;ported;</Q> and thereby their own &s;trength to be le&s;&s;en'd; which was an objection of Weight, and not mention'd before to the King, nor con&s;ider'd by him. <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he was unwilling to make another ob|jection, <MILESTONE N="10"> which reflected upon a Per&s;on &s;o dear to him, and for whom he would at any time lay down his Life; which was, that he much fear'd the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> had not &s;teadine&s;s of mind enough to go through with &s;uch an Undertaking, which otherwi&s;e would be as ea&s;y as ho|nourable.&endq;</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE King, well &s;atisfied with the Di&s;cour&s;e he made, told him, &startq;that he was not Him&s;elf without the &s;ame apprehen&s;ions he had, and knew but one way to &s;ecure the bu&s;ine&s;s, if he would undertake the Journey with him, by which all his fears would be compos'd&punc; His Coun&s;el would govern the Earl in all things, and his credit with the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> which &s;hould be improv'd by his Maje&s;ties recommendation, would&endq; prevent any prejudice in him towards the Earl.</Q> <Q>The King added, &startq;that the Service it&s;elf was of &s;o va&s;t importance, that it might pre&s;erve his Crown, and therefore his conducting it, without which he &s;aw little hope of Succe&s;s, would be a matter of great merit, and could not be&endq; Unrewarded.</Q> <HI>O Neile</HI> &s;eem'd wonderfully &s;urpris'd with the Propo&s;i|tion, and in &s;ome di&s;order (which he could hand&s;omly put on when he would) &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that he would never di&s;obey any Command his Maje&s;ty would po&s;itively lay upon him; but that he &s;hould look upon it as the greate&s;t misfortune that could befall him, to receive &s;uch a Command, <MILESTONE N="30"> as would deprive him of attending uppon his Maje&s;ty in the next Cam|pagne, where he was &s;ure there mu&s;t be a Battle; from which he had&endq; rather lo&s;e his life than be ab&s;ent.</Q> <Q>Then he &s;aid, &startq;though the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> was his Kin&s;man, and his Friend, and one who, he thought, lov'd him better than he did any other Man, yet he was the la&s;t Man in&endq; <HI>England</HI> with whom he would be willing to joyn in any Enterpri&s;e;</Q> mentioning his Pride, and Levity, and Weakne&s;s, and many Infirmities, which made it appear more requi&s;ite, that a Wi&s;er Man &s;hould have the application of his Intere&s;t; which he knew mu&s;t be him&s;elf. The King renew'd his de&s;ire to him to undertake the Service, as the greate&s;t he <MILESTONE N="40"> could perform for him; and commanded him to confer with the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who &s;hould inform him of all particulars, and &s;hould find the be&s;t way to make the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> to communicate the Affair to him, and to wi&s;h his A&s;&s;i&s;tance; which was ea&s;ily brought to pa&s;s, nor was there any thing relating to it that the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> had not before imparted to him; though the King &s;upected it not.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Digby</HI> had now brought the bu&s;ine&s;s to the &s;tate he wi&s;hed; and, within two or three days, <Q>told the King &startq;how glad the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> was, that he had leave to communicate the matter with <HI>O Neile;</HI> and de&s;ired nothing more than that his Maje&s;ty would com|mand <MILESTONE N="50"> him to go over with him; which was an excellent point gained, wherein he had him&s;elf cho&s;en the Per&s;on, who was only fit to be with him, whereas he might have been jealous, if he had been fir&s;t recom|mended to him. The Earl had, upon the fir&s;t mention of him, taken
<PB N="472" REF="5390">
Notice of the difficulty he might find to draw his Men out of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Quarters, by the oppo&s;ition of tho&s;e who commanded there in chief; but, he &s;aid, if the King would make <HI>O Neile</HI> go with him, all that dif|ficulty would be remov'd; for <HI>Owen O Neile</HI> who was Uncle to <HI>Daniel,</HI> was the General of all the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> in <HI>Ul&s;ter,</HI> and incomparably the be&s;t Soldier, and the Wi&s;e&s;t Man that was among the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Rebels, having long &s;erv'd the King of <HI>Spain</HI> in <HI>Flanders</HI> in very eminent Command; and the Earl &s;aid, that he was &s;ure <HI>Daniel</HI> had that credit with his Uncle, that he would not refu&s;e at his reque&s;t, to connive at what was&endq; nece&s;&s;ary for the Earl to do, which was all he de&s;ir'd.</Q> <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Digby</HI> left not this circum&s;tance, which he pretended ne|ver to have thought of before, unob&s;erv'd, to advance the Coun&s;el he had given for employing <HI>O Neile;</HI> whom he took occa&s;ion then to Magnify again; <Q>and told the King, &startq;that he had already convinced the Earl of <HI>Antrim,</HI> of the folly of de&s;iring any other Commi&s;&s;ion, than what the Marquis of <HI>Ormond</HI> &s;hould find nece&s;&s;ary to give him; and how im|po&s;&s;ible it was for him to have any &s;ucce&s;s in that de&s;ign, without the chearful concurrence, and friend&s;hip of the Marquis: which the Earl was now brought to confe&s;s, and &s;olemnly promi&s;ed to do all he &s;hould&endq; be advi&s;ed, to compa&s;s it.</Q> <Q>But after all this, he lamented <HI>&startq;O Neile</HI>'s <MILESTONE N="20"> ob&s;tinate aver&s;ion to undertake the Journey, for many rea&s;ons; who, he &s;aid, had engaged him, under all the obligations of the Friend&s;hip that was between them, to prevail with his Maje&s;ty, that he might not be ab&s;ent from his charge in the Army, in a Sea&s;on when there mu&s;t be &s;o much Action, and when his Maje&s;ties Per&s;on, whom he &s;o dearly lov'd, mu&s;t be in &s;o great danger; and that he had told him freely, that he could not hone&s;tly move his Maje&s;ty to that purpo&s;e, whom he knew to be &s;o po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of the nece&s;&s;itie of his going into <HI>Ireland</HI> with the Earl, that he &s;hould de&s;pair of the whole Enterpri&s;e, which was the mo&s;t hopeful he had in his view, if he did not cheafully &s;ubmit to act <MILESTONE N="30"> his part towards it: but that notwith&s;tanding all he had &s;aid, by which he had &s;hut out all farther importunity towards him&s;elf, his Maje&s;ty mu&s;t expect to be very much &s;truggled with; and that <HI>O Neile</HI> would lay him&s;elf at his feet, and get all his Friends to joyn with him in a &s;up|plication for his Maje&s;ties excu&s;e; and that there was no more to be done, but that his maje&s;ty, with &s;ome warmth, &s;hould command him to de&s;i&s;t from farther importunity, and to comply with what he &s;hould expect from him; which, he &s;aid, he knew would &s;ilence all farther op|po&s;ition: for that <HI>O Neile</HI> had that entire re&s;ignation to his Maje&s;ties&endq; plea&s;ure, that he would rather dye than offend him.</Q> Upon which, and <MILESTONE N="40"> to cut off all farther Mediation, and Interpo&s;ition, the King pre&s;ently &s;ent for him, and graciou&s;ly conjur'd him, with as much pa&s;&s;ion as he could &s;hew, <Q>&startq;to give over all thoughts of excu&s;e, and to provide for his Journey&endq; within three or four days.</Q></P>
<P>ALL things being thus di&s;po&s;ed, and the King expecting every day that the Earl and <HI>O Neile</HI> would take their leaves, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> came to him, and &s;aid, <Q>&startq;M^r <HI>O Neile,</HI> had an humble Sute to his Maje&s;ty at parting; which to him did not &s;eem unrea&s;onable, and therefore he hoped his Maje&s;ty would rai&s;e the Spirits of the poor Man, &s;ince he did believe in his Con&s;cience, that he de&s;ired it more for the advancement&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> of his Maje&s;ties Service, than to &s;atisfy his own Ambition.</Q> <Q>He put him in mind of the &startq;long pretence he had to be Groom of his Bed-Chamber, for the which he could not choo&s;e but &s;ay, that he had the Queen's pro|mi&s;e, at the &s;ame time when <HI>Percy,</HI> and <HI>Wilmot</HI> had the like for Their

<P>HOW much rea&s;on &s;oever this di&s;cour&s;e carried with it, with all the in&s;inuations a very powerful Speaker could add to it in the delivery, the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> found an aver&s;ion, and wearine&s;s in the King all the time he was &s;peaking; and therefore, as his la&s;t effort, and with a Countenance as if he thought his Maje&s;ty much in the wrong, he concluded, <Q>&startq;that he <MILESTONE N="30"> doubted his Maje&s;ty would too late repent his aver&s;ion in this parti|cular; and that Men ought not to be &s;ent upon &s;uch errands, with the &s;harp &s;en&s;e of any di&s;obligation: That if his Maje&s;ty plea&s;ed, he might &s;ettle this Affair in &s;uch a manner as <HI>O Neile</HI> might go away very well plea&s;ed, and his Maje&s;ty enjoy the greate&s;t part of his re&s;olution: That <HI>O Neile</HI> &s;hould not be yet in &s;o near an attendance about his Per&s;on: That the Employment was full of hazard, and would require a great expence of time: That he was a Man of that Nature, as would not leave a bu&s;ine&s;s half done, and would be a&s;hamed to &s;ee his Maje&s;ties face, before there were &s;ome very con&s;iderable effect of his Activity <MILESTONE N="40"> and Indu&s;try; and con&s;idering what was to be done in <HI>Ireland,</HI> and the po&s;ture of Affairs in <HI>England,</HI> it might be a very long time before <HI>O Neile</HI> might find him&s;elf again in the King's pre&s;ence, to enter upon&endq; his Office in the Bed-Chamber;</Q> and therefore propo&s;ed, <Q>&startq;that the hour he was to leave <HI>Oxford,</HI> he might be &s;worn Groom of the Bed-Cham|ber; by which he &s;hould depart only with a Title, the Effect whereof he &s;hould not be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of, before he had very well de&s;erv'd it, and return'd again to his Maje&s;ties pre&s;ence; which, po&s;&s;ibly, might require&endq; more time than the other had to live.</Q> This la&s;t prevail'd more than all the re&s;t, and the imagination that the other might be well &s;atisfied with <MILESTONE N="50"> a place he &s;hould never enjoy, made his Maje&s;ty con&s;ent, that, in the la&s;t Article of time, he &s;hould be &s;worn before his departure; with which the other was well &s;atisfied, making little doubt but that he &s;hould be able to di&s;patch that part of the bu&s;ine&s;s which was incumbent on him,

<P>WHILST this Intrigue was carrying on for M^r <HI>O Neile,</HI> there was an|other, as unacceptable, &s;et on foot on the behalf of the Earl of <HI>Antrim;</HI> for who&s;e Per&s;on the King had as little regard or kindne&s;s, as for any Man of his rank. The Dutche&s;s of <HI>Buckingham,</HI> his Wife, was now in <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> whom the King allways heard with favour; his Maje&s;ty retaining a mo&s;t gracious memory of her former Husband, whom, He thought, &s;he had forgotten too &s;oon. This Lady, being of a great Wit and Spirit, <MILESTONE N="10"> when &s;he found that the King now thought her Husband good for &s;ome|what, which he had never before done, was re&s;olv'd he &s;hould carry with him &s;ome te&s;timony of the King's e&s;teem; which, &s;he thought, would be at lea&s;t &s;ome ju&s;tification of the affection &s;he had manife&s;ted for him. <Q>She told the King, &startq;that her Husband was &s;o eclip&s;ed in <HI>Ireland,</HI> by the no-countenance his Maje&s;ty had ever &s;hew'd towards him, and by his preferring &s;ome who were his equals, to degrees and tru&s;ts above him, and by rai&s;ing others, who were in all re&s;pects much inferior to him, to the &s;ame Title with him, and to Authority above him, that &s;he <MILESTONE N="20"> believ'd he had not credit and intere&s;t enough to do the Service he de|&s;ired to do: That, in that Country, the Lords and Greate&s;t Men had reputation over their Tenants and Va&s;&s;als, as they were known to have Grace from the King; and when they were known to be without That,&endq; they had no more power than to exact their own ju&s;t &s;ervices.</Q> <Q>She la|mented &startq;the misfortune of her Husband, which &s;he had the more rea&s;on to do, becau&s;e it proceeded from Her; and that, whereas he had rea&s;on to have expected, that, by his Marriage with her, he might have been advanced in the Court, and in his Maje&s;ties favour, he had found &s;o little benefit from thence, that he might well believe, as She did, that he &s;uf|fer'd <MILESTONE N="30"> for it: Otherwi&s;e, it would not have been po&s;&s;ible for a Per&s;on of the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI>'s E&s;tate, and Intere&s;t, and &s;o well qualified, as &s;he had rea&s;on to believe him to be in all re&s;pects, after the expence of &s;o much Money in attendance upon the Court, to be without any mark or evidence of his Maje&s;ties favour; and to return now again in the &s;ame forlorne condition into <HI>Ireland,</HI> would but give his Enemies more encouragement to in&s;ult over him, and to cro&s;s any de&s;igns he had to&endq; advance his Maje&s;ties Service.</Q> <Q>In conclu&s;ion &s;he de&s;ired, &startq;that the King&endq; would make her Husband a Marquis;</Q> without which, &s;he did as good as declare, that he &s;hould not undertake that Employment. Though his <MILESTONE N="40"> Maje&s;ty was neither plea&s;ed with the matter, nor the manner, he did not di&s;cern &s;o great an inconvenience in the gratifying him, as might weigh down the benefit he expected with reference to <HI>Scotland;</HI> which the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> every day, with great earne&s;tne&s;s, put him in mind of. Thereupon, he gave Order for a Warrant to make the Earl of <HI>Antrim</HI> a Marquis.</P>
<P>SO He and <HI>O Neile,</HI> being well plea&s;ed, begun their Journey for <HI>Ire|land;</HI> and at the &s;ame time the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> took his leave of the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> Mountro&s;e <HI>goes privately into</HI> Scotland, <HI>and rai&s;es an Army; and has great &s;ucce&s;s.</HI></NOTE> King with &s;everal Gentlemen, as if they meant to make their way toge|ther into <HI>Scotland.</HI> But the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> after he had continued <MILESTONE N="50"> his Journey two or three days in that Equipage, which he knew could be no &s;ecret, and that it would draw the Enemies Troops together for the Guard of all Pa&s;&s;es to meet with him, was found mi&s;&s;ing one morning by his Company; who, after &s;ome &s;tay and enquiry, return'd back to <HI>Oxford,</HI>

whil&s;t that Noble Per&s;on, with incredible Addre&s;s and Fatigue, had not only quitted his Company, and his Servants, but his Hor&s;e al&s;o, and found a &s;afe pa&s;&s;age, for the mo&s;t part, on foot, through all the Enemies Quar|ters, till he came to the very Borders; from whence, by the A&s;&s;i&s;tance of Friends whom he tru&s;ted, he found him&s;elf &s;ecure in the Highlands, where he lay quiet, without undertaking any Action, until the Marquis of <HI>Antrim,</HI> by the Countenance and A&s;&s;i&s;tance of the Marquis of <HI>Ormond,</HI> did make good &s;o much of his undertaking, that he &s;ent over <HI>Alexander Macdonnel,</HI> a &s;tout and an active Officer (whom they call'd by an <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> ap|pellation <HI>Calkito)</HI> with a Regiment of fifteen hundred Soldiers; who <MILESTONE N="10"> landed in the Highlands in <HI>Scotland,</HI> at, or near the place that had been agreed on, and where the Earl of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> was ready to receive them; which he did with great joy; and quickly publi&s;hed his Commi&s;&s;ion of being General for the King over all that Kingdom. With this handful of Men brought together, with tho&s;e circum&s;tances remember'd, he brought in &s;o many of his own Country-men to joyn with him, as were &s;trong enough to Arme them&s;elves at the Charge of their Enemies; whom they fir&s;t defeated; and every day encrea&s;ed in power, till he fought, and pre|vailed in &s;o many &s;everal Battles, that he made him&s;elf, upon the matter, ma&s;ter of the Kingdom; and did all tho&s;e &s;tupen$ous Acts, which de|&s;ervedly <MILESTONE N="20"> are the Subject of a Hi&s;tory by it &s;elf, excellently written in Latin by a Learned Prelate of that Nation. And this preamble to that Hi&s;tory was not improper for this relation, being made up of many &s;e|cret pa&s;&s;ages known to few; in which the Artifices of Court were very notable, and as my&s;terious as the Motions in that Sphere u&s;e to be. There will be hereafter occa&s;ion, before the conclu&s;ion of our Hi&s;tory, to men|tion that Noble Lord again, and his Zeal for the Crown, before he came to his &s;ad Cata&s;trophe.</P>
<P>THE King now found, that, notwith&s;tanding all the divi&s;ions in the Parliament, and the factions in the City, there would be an Army ready <MILESTONE N="30"> to march again&s;t him before he could put him&s;elf into a Po&s;ture ready to receive it; and was therefore the more impatient that the Prince &s;hould leave <HI>Oxford,</HI> and begin his Journey to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> which he did within a fortnight after the expiration of the Treaty at <HI>Uxbridge.</HI> And &s;ince the King did at that time, within him&s;elf (for publickly he was contented that it &s;hould be otherwi&s;e believ'd) re&s;olve that the Prince &s;hould only keep his Court in the We&s;t, that they might be &s;eparated from each other, without engaging him&s;elf in any Martial Action, or being &s;o much as pre&s;ent in any Army, it had been very happy, and, to di&s;cerning Men, &s;eem'd then a thing de&s;irable, if his Maje&s;ty had removed His Court into <MILESTONE N="40"> the We&s;t too, either to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> or, which it may be had been better, to <HI>Exeter.</HI> For, &s;ince <HI>Reading</HI> and <HI>Abingdon</HI> were both po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Par|liament, and thereby <HI>Oxford</HI> become the head Quarter, it was not &s;o fit that the Court &s;hould remain there; which, by the multitude of Ladies, and Per&s;ons of Quality, who re&s;ided there, would not probably endure &s;uch an Attack of the Enemy, as the Situation of the place and the good Fortifications which inclo&s;ed it, might very well bear. Nor would the Enemy have &s;ate down before it, till they had done their bu&s;ine&s;s in all other places, if they had not pre&s;um'd, that the Inhabitants within, would not be willing to &s;ubmit to any notable di&s;tre&s;s. If, at this time, a good <MILESTONE N="50"> Garri&s;on had only been left there, and all the Court, and Per&s;ons of Qua|lity, remov'd into the We&s;t with the Prince, it would probably have been a means &s;peedily to have reduced to the King's obedience tho&s;e &s;mall Garri&s;ons, which &s;tood out; and the King him&s;elf might, by the Spring,

have been able to have carried a good recruit of Men to his Army, and might likewi&s;e have made <HI>Oxford</HI> the place of Rendezvous, at the time when it &s;hould be fit for him to take the Field. But the truth is, not only the Ladys, who were very powerful in &s;uch con&s;ultations of State, but very few of the re&s;t, of what Degree, or Quality &s;oever, who had ex|cellent accommodations in the Colleges, which they could not have found any where el&s;e, would, without extreme murmuring, have been content to have chang'd their Quarters. Be&s;ides, the King had that Royal Affection for the Univer&s;ity, that he thought it well de&s;erv'd the honour of his own Pre&s;ence; and always re&s;olv'd, that it &s;hould be never &s;o expos'd <MILESTONE N="10"> to the extremity of War, as to fall into tho&s;e barbarous hands, without making all nece&s;&s;ary conditions for the pre&s;ervation of &s;o Venerable a place from rapine, &s;acrilege, and de&s;truction.</P>
<P>THUS that con&s;ideration of removing the Court from thence, was only &s;ecretly entred upon, and laid a&s;ide, without making it the &s;ubject of any Publick Debate: and &s;ince the other could not have been effected, it had been well if the whole Council which was a&s;&s;ign'd to attend the Prince, had been obliged to have perform'd that Service. But both the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Southampton,</HI> Men of great reputa|tion and authority, excu&s;ed them&s;elves to the King, for not &s;ubmitting <MILESTONE N="20"> to that his Command, and for de&s;iring to continue &s;till about his Per|&s;on; the one thinking it &s;ome diminution to his greatne&s;s to be at any di&s;tance from his Maje&s;ty, to whom he had adher'd with that &s;ignal Fi|delity and Affection, when &s;o many had de&s;erted him; the other, being newly married, and engaged in a Family, which he could not, without great inconveniencies, have left behind him; nor without more have carried with him. Nor was the King difficult in admitting their excu&s;es, having named them rather to obviate &s;ome jealou&s;ies, which were like to be entertain'd upon the fir&s;t di&s;cour&s;e of &s;ending the Prince into the We&s;t, than that he believed they would be willing to be engaged in the <MILESTONE N="30"> Service. However, it was ea&s;y to be fore&s;een, that, upon any ill accidents, which were like enough to fall out, they who were &s;till oblig'd to that duty, would not have reputation enough to exact that general &s;ubmi&s;|&s;ion, and obedience, which ought to be paid to the Commands of the Prince; of which there was &s;hortly after too manife&s;t evidence.</P>
<P>THERE was an Act of Divine Ju&s;tice about this time executed by <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> John Ho|tham <HI>and his Son tryed at a Court of War: Both are con|demn'd, and beheaded.</HI></NOTE> tho&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter,</HI> which ought not to be forgotten in the relation of the Affairs of this year; and which ought to have cau&s;ed very u&s;eful re|flections to be made by many who were equally engag'd; &s;ome of whom afterwards did undergoe the &s;ame fate. There hath been often mention <MILESTONE N="40"> before of S^r <HI>John Hotham,</HI> who &s;hut the Gates of <HI>Hull</HI> again&s;t the King, and refu&s;ed to give him entrance into that Town, when he came thither attended only by his own Servants, before the beginning of the War; and was, in truth, the immediate cau&s;e of the War. It was the more won|derfull, that a Per&s;on of a full and ample fortune, who was not di&s;turbed by any Fancies in Religion, had unque&s;tion'd duty to the Crown, and re|verence for the Government both of Church and State, &s;hould &s;o fooli&s;h|ly expo&s;e Him&s;elf, and his Family, of great Antiquity, to comply with the humours of tho&s;e Men who&s;e Per&s;ons he did not much e&s;teem, and who&s;e De&s;igns he perfectly dete&s;ted. But, as his particular Animo&s;ity <MILESTONE N="50"> again&s;t the Earl of <HI>Strafford,</HI> fir&s;t engaged him in that Company, &s;o his vanity and ambition, and the Conce&s;&s;ions the King had made to their un|rea&s;onable demands, made him concur farther with them, than his own judgement di&s;po&s;ed him to. He had taken upon him the Government
<PB N="477" REF="5450">
of <HI>Hull,</HI> without any apprehen&s;ion, or imagination, that it would ever make him acce&s;&s;ory to Rebellion; but believ'd, that, when the King and Parliament &s;hould be reconciled, the eminence of that Charge would pro|mote him to &s;ome of tho&s;e rewards and honours, which that Party re&s;olv'd to divide among them&s;elves. When he found him&s;elf more dangerou&s;ly and de&s;perately embarked than he ever intended to be, he bethought him|&s;elf of all po&s;&s;ible ways to di&s;intangle him&s;elf, and to wind him&s;elf out of the Labyrinth he was in. His comportment towards the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and <HI>A&s;hburnham,</HI> and his Inclinations at that time, have been mentioned before at large; and from that time, the entire confidence the Parliament <MILESTONE N="10"> had in his Son, and the vigilance and jealou&s;y that he was known to have towards his Father, was that alone that pre&s;erved him longer in the Go|vernment. Be&s;ides that they had &s;o con&s;tituted the Garri&s;on, that they knew it could never be in the Father's power to do them hurt. But, af|ter this, when they di&s;cover'd &s;ome alteration in the Son's behaviour, and that the pride and &s;tubborne&s;s of his Nature would not &s;uffer him to &s;ub|mit to the Command of the Lord <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and that &s;uperiority over both his Father and Him, with which the Parliament had inve&s;ted that Lord, and had &s;ome inkling of &s;ecret Me&s;&s;ages between the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> and young <HI>Hotham,</HI> they cau&s;ed both Father and Son to be <MILESTONE N="20"> &s;uddainly &s;ei&s;ed upon, and &s;ent up Pri&s;oners to the Parliament; which im|mediately committed them to the Tower, upon a charge of high-trea&s;on.</P>
<P>THOUGH there was Evidence enough again&s;t them, yet they had &s;o many Friends in both Hou&s;es of Parliament, and &s;ome of that Intere&s;t in the Army, that they were pre&s;erv'd from farther pro&s;ecution, and re|main'd long Pri&s;oners in the Tower without being brought to any Trial; &s;o that they believed their puni&s;hment to be at the highe&s;t. But when that Party prevail'd that re&s;olv'd to new Model the Army, and to make as many examples of their rigour and &s;everity, as might terrify all Men from falling from them, they call'd importunately, that the two <HI>Hotham</HI>'s <MILESTONE N="30"> might be tryed at a Court of War, for their Treachery and Trea&s;on; and they who had hitherto pre&s;erv'd them, had now lo&s;t their Intere&s;t; &s;o that they were both brought to their Trial, &s;ome little time before the Treaty at <HI>Uxbridge,</HI> and both condemn'd to lo&s;e their heads. The prin|cipal Charge again&s;t the Father was, his &s;uffering the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> to e&s;cape; and a letter was produced, by the Treachery of a Servant, again&s;t the Son, which he had &s;ent to the Marquis of <HI>New-Ca&s;tle.</HI> The vile ar|tifices that were u&s;ed both before and after their Trial, were &s;o barbarous, and inhuman, as have been rarely practiced among Chri&s;tians.</P>
<P>THE Father was fir&s;t condemn'd to &s;uffer upon a day appointed, and <MILESTONE N="40"> the Son afterwards to be executed in like manner the day following: the Night before, or the very Morning, that S^r <HI>John Hotham</HI> was to dye, a Reprieve was &s;ent from the Hou&s;e of Peers to &s;u&s;pend his execution for three days. <Q>The Commons were highly incen&s;ed at this pre&s;umption in the Lords; and to prevent the like mi&s;chief for the future, they made an Order &startq;to all Mayors, Sheriffs, Bay liffs, and other Mini&s;ters of Ju&s;tice, that no Reprieve &s;hould be granted, or allow'd for any Per&s;on again&s;t whom the &s;entence of Death was pronounced, except the &s;ame had pa&s;&s;ed, and had the con&s;ent of both Hou&s;es of Parliament; and that if it pa&s;&s;ed only by the Hou&s;e of Peers, it &s;hould be looked upon as invalid and void, and&endq; execution &s;hould not be thereupon forborne, or &s;u&s;pended.</Q> By this ac|cident the Son was brought to his Execution before his Father, upon the day on which he was &s;entenced to &s;uffer; <Q>who dyed with Courage, and re|proaching &startq;the ingratitude of the Parliament, and their continuance of

Whether he had yet &s;ome promi&s;e from <HI>Peters,</HI> that he &s;hould only be &s;hew'd to the People, and &s;o return'd &s;afe again to the Tower, which was then gene|rally reported, and believ'd, or whether he was broken with de&s;pair (which is more probable) when he &s;aw that his Enemies prevail'd &s;o far, that he <MILESTONE N="10"> could not be permitted to live tho&s;e two days which the Peers had granted him, certain it is that the poor Man appear'd &s;o di&s;pirited, that he &s;poke but few words after he came upon the Scaffold, and &s;uffer'd his ungodly Confe&s;&s;or <HI>Peters,</HI> to tell the People <Q>&startq;that he had reveal'd him&s;elf to him,&endq; and confe&s;s'd his offences again&s;t the Parliament;</Q> and &s;o he committed his head to the block. This was the woeful Tragedy of the&s;e two unhappy Gentlemen; in which there were &s;o many circum&s;tances of an unu&s;ual Nature, that the immediate hand of Almighty God could not but appear in it to all Men who knew their Natures, Humours, and Tran&s;actions.</P>
<P>SINCE the la&s;t Office of a General, with reference to the King's Quar|ters, <MILESTONE N="20"> which the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> perform'd before he found it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;urrender his Commi&s;&s;ion to the Parliament, was done before the end of this year, it will be proper in this place to mention it, both in re&s;pect of the Nature of the thing it &s;elf, and the Circum&s;tances with which it was conducted, it being a Letter &s;ign'd by the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and &s;ent by a Trumpet to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> but penn'd by a Committee of Parliament, and peru&s;ed by both Hou&s;es before it was &s;ign'd by their General; who u&s;ed, in all di&s;patches made by Him&s;elf, to ob&s;erve all decency in the forms. It was a very in&s;olent Letter, and upon a very in&s;olent occa&s;ion. The Parliament had, &s;ome Months before, made an Ordinance again&s;t <MILESTONE N="30"> giving Quarter to any of the <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Nation which &s;hould be taken Pri|&s;oners, either at Sea or Land; which was not taken notice of, or indeed known to the King, till long after; though the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and the Officers under him at Sea, had as often as he met with any <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Frigats, or &s;uch Freebooters as &s;ailed under their Commi&s;&s;ion, taken all the Sea Men who became Pri&s;oners to them of that Nation, and bound them back to back, and thrown them over board into the Sea, without di&s;tin|ction of their condition, if they were <HI>Iri&s;h.</HI> In this cruel manner very many poor Men peri&s;hed daily; of which, when it was generally known, the King &s;aid nothing, becau&s;e none of tho&s;e Per&s;ons were in his Maje|&s;ties <MILESTONE N="40"> Service; and how barbarous &s;oever the proceedings were, his Ma|je&s;ty could not complain of it, without undergoing the reproach of being concern'd on the behalf, and in favour of the Rebels of <HI>Ireland.</HI></P>
<P>BUT there had been lately, in &s;ome Service at Land, &s;ome Pri&s;oners taken of the King's Troops, and upon pretence, that they were <HI>Iri&s;h</HI> Men, as many as they thought to be of that Nation, were all hanged, to the Number of ten or twelve. Whereupon, Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> having about the time when he heard of that barbarity, taken an equal Number of the Parliament Soldiers, cau&s;ed Them likewi&s;e to be hanged upon the next Tree; which the Parliament declared to be an Act of great inju&s;tice, <MILESTONE N="50"> and cruelty; and appointed the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> to expo&s;tulate it with Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> very rudely, in the Letter they had cau&s;ed to be penn'd for him, and to &s;end a Copy of their Ordinance, enclo&s;ed in the &s;aid Letter, with expre&s;&s;ions full of reproach, for his <Q>&startq;pre&s;umption in making an Or|dinance

of Theirs, the Argument to ju&s;tify an Action of &s;o much inhu|manity;&endq;</Q> which was the fir&s;t knowledge the King had of any &s;uch De|claration, with reference to the War in <HI>England;</HI> nor had there been, from the beginning of it, any &s;uch example made. Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> re|turn'd &s;uch an An&s;wer as was rea&s;onable, and with a &s;harpne&s;s equal to the provocation, and &s;ent it to the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex;</HI> who, the day before he receiv'd it, had given up his Commi&s;&s;ion; but &s;ent it immediately to the two Hou&s;es, who were exceedingly enraged at it; &s;ome of them &s;ay|ing, <Q>&startq;that they wonder'd it was &s;o long on the way, for that certainly it&endq; had been prepared at <HI>Uxbridge.</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>IT was upon the 4^t^h of <HI>March,</HI> that the Prince parted from the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>&s;ent by the King to re&s;ide at</HI> Bri|&s;tol.</NOTE> his Father; and, about a Week after, came to <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> where he was now to act a part by Him&s;elf, as the Affairs &s;hould require, or rather where he was to fit &s;till without acting any thing; the end being, as was &s;aid be|fore, only that the King and the Prince might not be expo&s;ed at the &s;ame time to the &s;ame danger; without any purpo&s;e that he &s;hould rai&s;e any more &s;trength, than was nece&s;&s;ary to the &s;ecurity of his own Per&s;on; or that indeed he &s;hould move farther We&s;tward than that City.

damage towards his Maje&s;ty: A time, in which want of di&s;cretion, and meer folly, produced as much mi&s;chief, as the mo&s;t barefaced Villany could have done; in which the King &s;uffer'd as much, by the irre&s;olu|tion, and un&s;teadine&s;s of his own Coun&s;els, and by the ill humour, and faction of his Coun&s;ellors; by their not fore&s;eeing what was evident to mo&s;t other Men, and by their jealou&s;ies of what was not like to fall out; &s;ometimes by deliberating too long without re&s;olving, and as often re&s;olving without any deliberation, and mo&s;t of all, not exe|cuting Vigorou&s;ly what was deliberated and re&s;olv'd, as by the in|defatigable indu&s;try, and the irre&s;i&s;tible power and &s;trength of his E|nemies. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>ALL the&s;e things mu&s;t be very particularly enlarged upon, and ex|po&s;ed to the naked View, in the Relation of what fell out in this year, 1645, in which we are engaged, except we will &s;werve from that pre|ci&s;e Rule of ingenuity, and integrity, we profe&s;s to ob&s;erve; and there|by leave the Reader more perplexed, to &s;ee the mo&s;t prodigious acci|dents fall out, without di&s;cerning the no le&s;s prodigious cau&s;es which produced them; which would lead him into as wrong an e&s;timate of things, and per&s;wade him to believe, that a univer&s;al corruption of the hearts of the whole Nation had brought forth tho&s;e lamentable effects; <MILESTONE N="20"> whereas they proceeded only from the folly and the frowardne&s;s, from the weakne&s;s and the wilfulne&s;s, the pride and the pa&s;&s;ion of particular Per&s;ons, who&s;e Memories ought to be charged with their own evil Actions, rather than that the Infamy of them &s;hould be laid on the Age wherein they liv'd; which did produce as many Men, eminent for their loyalty and incorrupted fidelity to the Crown, as any that had preceded it. Nor is it po&s;&s;ible to di&s;cour&s;e of all the&s;e particulars, with the clear|ne&s;s that is nece&s;&s;ary to Subject them to Common under&s;tandings, with|out opening a door for &s;uch reflections upon the King him&s;elf, as &s;hall &s;eem to call both his Wi&s;dom, and his Steadine&s;s into que&s;tion, as if he <MILESTONE N="30"> had wanted the one to apprehend and di&s;cover, and the other to pre|vent the Mi&s;chiefs which threaten'd him. All which con&s;iderations might very well di&s;courage, and even terrify me from pro&s;ecuting this part of the Work, with &s;uch a freedom and openne&s;s, as mu&s;t call many things to memory which are forgotten, or were never &s;ufficiently un|der&s;tood; and rather per&s;wade me to &s;atisfy my &s;elf, with a bare rela|tion of what was done, and with the known event of that mi&s;erable year (which, in truth, produced all that follow'd in the &s;ucceeding years) without prying too &s;trictly into the cau&s;es of tho&s;e effects, and &s;o let them &s;eem rather to be the production of Providence, and the in&s;tances <MILESTONE N="40"> of Divine di&s;plea&s;ure, than &s;hew how they proceed from the weakne&s;s and inadvertency of Men, not totally abandon'd by God Almighty to the mo&s;t unruly lu&s;ts of their own appetite, and inventions.</P>
<P>BUT I am too far embarked in this Sea already, and have proceeded with too much &s;implicity and &s;incerity with reference to Things, and Per&s;ons, and in the examinations of the grounds, and over&s;ights of Coun&s;els, to be now frighted with the pro&s;pect of tho&s;e Materials, which mu&s;t be comprehended within the relation of this years tran&s;actions. I know my &s;elf to be very free from any of tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;ions which naturally tran&s;port Men with prejudice towards the Per&s;ons whom they are <MILESTONE N="50"> obliged to mention, and who&s;e Actions they are at liberty to cen&s;ure. There is not a Man who acted the wor&s;t part, in this en&s;uing year, with whom I had ever the lea&s;t difference, or Per&s;onal unkindne&s;s, or towards
<PB N="485" REF="5530">
whom I had not much inclination of kindne&s;s, or from whom I did not receive all invitations of farther endearments. There were many who were not free from very great faults, and over&s;ights in the Coun&s;els of this year, with whom I had great Friend&s;hip, and which I did not di&s;|continue upon tho&s;e unhappy over&s;ights; nor did flatter them when they were pa&s;t, by excu&s;ing what they had done. I knew mo&s;t of the things my &s;elf which I mention, and therefore can An&s;wer for the Truth of them; and other mo&s;t important particulars, which were tran&s;acted in places very di&s;tant from me, were tran&s;mitted to me, by the King's immediate direction and order, even after he was in the hands and power <MILESTONE N="10"> of the Enemy, out of his own Memorials, and Journals. And as he was allways &s;evere to him&s;elf, in cen&s;uring his own over&s;ights, &s;o he could not but well fore&s;ee, that many of the misfortunes of this en&s;uing year, would reflect upon &s;ome want of re&s;olution in Him&s;elf, as well as upon the gro&s;s errors, and over&s;ights, to call them no wor&s;e, of tho&s;e who were tru&s;ted by him. Wherefore as I fir&s;t undertook this difficult work with His approbation, and by His encouragement, and for His vindi|cation, &s;o I enter upon this part of it, principally, that the world may &s;ee (at lea&s;t if there be ever a fit &s;ea&s;on for $Word$ a Communication; which is not like to be in this pre&s;ent Age) $Word$ difficult it was for a <MILESTONE N="20"> Prince, &s;o unworthily reduced to tho&s;e &s;treights his Maje&s;ty was in, to find Mini&s;ters, and In&s;truments, equal to the great Work that was to be done; and how unlikely it was for him to have better &s;ucce&s;s under their conduct whom it was then very proper for him to tru&s;t with it; and then, without my being over &s;ollicitous to ab&s;olve him from tho&s;e mi&s;takes, and weakne&s;&s;es, to which he was in truth &s;ometimes liable, he will be found not only a Prince of admirable Virtue, and Piety, but of great parts of Knowledge and Judgement; and that the mo&s;t &s;ignal of his Misfortunes proceeded chiefly from the mode&s;ty of his Nature, which kept him from tru&s;ting him&s;elf enough, and made him believe, <MILESTONE N="30"> that others di&s;cern'd better, who were much inferior to him in tho&s;e fa|culties; and &s;o to depart often from his own rea&s;on, to follow the opi|nions of more unskilful Men, who&s;e affections he believ'd to be un|que&s;tionable to his Service. And &s;o we proceed in our relation of mat|ter of Fact.</P>
<P>WHAT expectation &s;oever there was, that the <HI>Self-denying Ordinance,</HI> after it had, upon &s;o long deliberation, pa&s;&s;ed the Hou&s;e of Commons, would have been rejected and ca&s;t out by the Peers; whereby the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> would &s;till have remain'd General; it did not take up &s;o long Debate there. The Marquis of <HI>Argyle</HI> was now come from <HI>Scotland,</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> and &s;ate with the Commi&s;&s;ioners of that Kingdom, over whom he had a great a&s;cendent. He was, in matters of Religion, and in relation to the Church, purely Presbyterian; but in matter of State, and with re|ference to the War, perfectly Independent. He abhorr'd all thoughts of Peace, and that the King &s;hould ever more have the Government, towards who&s;e Per&s;on, notwith&s;tanding the infinite obligations he had to him, he had allways an inveterate malice. He had made a fa&s;t Friend|&s;hip with S^r <HI>Harry Vane,</HI> during his late being in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and they both liked each others Principles in Government. From the time of His coming to the Town, the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners were le&s;s vehement <MILESTONE N="50"> in ob&s;tructing the Ordinance, or the new modelling the Army: &s;o that after it came to the Hou&s;e of Peers, though thereby the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Warwick,</HI> and the Earl of <HI>Denbigh</HI>

In the end it was agreed, that, at a conference of both Hou&s;es in the Painted-Chamber, he &s;hould deliver his Commi&s;&s;ion; which he did. And becau&s;e he had no very plau&s;ible faculty in expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf, he <MILESTONE N="20"> cho&s;e to do it in Writing; which he deliver'd to them; <Q>wherein he de|clared, &startq;with what Affection and Fidelity he had &s;erv'd them, and as he had often ventur'd his Life for them, &s;o he would willingly have lo&s;t it in their Service; and &s;ince they believ'd, that what they had more to do would be better perform'd by another Man, he &s;ubmitted to their judgement, and re&s;tored their Commi&s;&s;ion to them; hoping&endq; they would find an abler Servant: concluding with &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions which made it manife&s;t that he did not think he had been well u&s;ed,</Q> or that they would be the better for the change: and &s;o left them, and return'd to his own Hou&s;e; whither both Hou&s;es, the next day, went <MILESTONE N="30"> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Earl of</HI> E&s;&s;ex <HI>re&s;igns his Commi&s;|&s;ion:</HI></NOTE> to attend him, and to return their thanks for the great Service he had done the Kingdom; which they acknowledged with all the Encomiums, and flattering Attributes they could devi&s;e.</P>
<P>BY this Self-denying Ordinance, together with the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the <NOTE PLACE="marg">And Divers other Officers.</NOTE> Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> the Earl of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> Major General <HI>Ma&s;&s;y,</HI> lo&s;t their Commands; as <HI>Cromwell</HI> &s;hould likewi&s;e have done. But a&s;&s;oon as the Ordinance was pa&s;&s;ed, and before the Re&s;igna|tion of the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> the Party that &s;teer'd, had cau&s;ed him to be &s;ent with a Body of Hor&s;e into the We&s;t, to relieve <HI>Taunton,</HI> that he might be ab&s;ent at the time when the other Officers deliver'd their Com|mi&s;&s;ions; <MILESTONE N="40"> which was quickly ob&s;erv'd; and thereupon Orders were given, to require his pre&s;ent Attendance in Parliament, and that their new General &s;hould &s;end &s;ome other Officer to attend that Service; which was pretended to be done; and the very day named, by which, it was averr'd that he would be in the Hou&s;e. A Rendezvous was then appointed, for their new General to take a View of their Troops, that he might appoint Officers to &s;ucceed tho&s;e who had left their Commands by Virtue of the Ordinance; and likewi&s;e in Their places who gave up their Commands, and refu&s;ed to &s;erve in the new Model, who were a great number of their be&s;t Commanders. <Q>From this Rendezvous, the <MILESTONE N="50"> General &s;ent to de&s;ire the Parliament, &startq;that they would give Lieutenant General <HI>Cromwell</HI> leave to &s;tay with him for &s;ome few days, for his better information, without which, he &s;hould not be able to perform
<PB N="487" REF="5550">
&endq; what they expected from him.</Q> The reque&s;t &s;eeming &s;o rea&s;onable, and being for &s;o &s;hort a time, little oppo&s;ition was made to it: and &s;hortly after, by another Letter, <Q>he de&s;ir'd with very much earne&s;tne&s;s, &startq;that&endq; they would allow <HI>Cromwell</HI> to &s;erve for that Campagne.</Q> Thus they compa&s;&s;ed their whole de&s;ign, in being rid of all tho&s;e who&s;e affections they knew were not agreeable to Theirs, and keeping <HI>Cromwell</HI> in Com|mand; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwell <HI>on|ly finds means to keep his Commi&s;&s;ion, and new Mo|dels the Army under</HI> Fairfax.</NOTE> who, in the Name of <HI>Fairfax,</HI> Modell'd the Army, and placed &s;uch Officers as were well known to Him, and to no body el&s;e; and ab&s;olutely govern'd the Whole Martial Affairs; as was quickly known <MILESTONE N="10"> to all Men; many particulars whereof will be mention'd at large here|after.</P>
<P>THOUGH the time &s;pent in pa&s;&s;ing the <HI>Self-denying Ordinance,</HI> and afterwards in new modelling their Army, had exceedingly retarded the preparations the Enemy was to make, before they could take the Field, whereby the King had more breathing time than he had rea&s;on to expect; yet all the hopes he had of Recruits again&s;t that Sea&s;on, de|pended upon the Activity of tho&s;e to who&s;e Care the providing tho&s;e Recruits was committed: &s;o that there will be little Occa&s;ion to men|tion any thing that was done at <HI>Oxford,</HI> till the Sea&s;on of the year oblig'd his Maje&s;ty to leave that place, and to march with his Army into the <MILESTONE N="20"> Field. Of all the Action that was till that time, the We&s;t was the Scene; where the Prince, a&s;&s;oon as he came to <HI>Bristol,</HI> found much more to do (and in which he could not avoid to meddle) than had been fore&s;een. One very great end of the Prince's Journey into the We&s;t, be&s;ides the other of more importance, which has been named before, was, that by His pre&s;ence, direction, and authority, the many Factions and Animo|&s;itys between particular Per&s;ons of Quality, and Intere&s;t in tho&s;e Parts, equal in their affections to the King's Service (yet they mi&s;erably infe&s;ted and di&s;tracted it) might be compo&s;ed, and reconcil'd; and that the en|deavours of all Men who wi&s;hed well, might be united in the advancing <MILESTONE N="30"> and carrying on that publick Service, in which all their joynt happy|ne&s;s and &s;ecurity was concern'd. This Province, be&s;ides the Prince's im|mediate countenance, and interpo&s;ition, requir'd great diligence and dexterity in tho&s;e about him, who were tru&s;ted in tho&s;e Affairs. But his Highne&s;s found quickly another task incumbent on him than had been expected, and a Mi&s;chief much more difficult to be ma&s;tered, and which, if unma&s;ter'd, mu&s;t inevitably produce much wor&s;e effects, than the other could, which was, the ambition, emulation, and conte&s;t, between &s;eve|ral Officers of the Army and Parties, which were then in tho&s;e Coun|tries, whereby their Troops were without any Di&s;cipline, and the Country <MILESTONE N="40"> as much expo&s;ed to rapine and violence, as it could be under an Enemy, and in an Article of time when a Body of the Enemy was every day <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The State of the We&s;tern Countys, when the Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>came to</HI> Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> expected.

General of <HI>Ham&s;hire, Su&s;&s;ex, Surrey,</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> without the lea&s;t purpo&s;e or imagination that he &s;hould ever be near the Prince. Some attempts he made, in the beginning, upon <HI>Christ-Church</HI> in <HI>Ham&s;hire,</HI> a little unfortified Fi&s;her-Town; yet was beaten off with lo&s;s: &s;o that he was forced to retire to <HI>Salisbury;</HI> where his Hor&s;e committed the &s;ame horrid outrages, and barbarities, as they had done in <HI>Ham&s;hire,</HI> without di&s;tinction of Friends or Foes; &s;o that tho&s;e Parts, which be|fore were well devoted to the King, worried by oppre&s;&s;ion, wi&s;hed for the acce&s;s of any Forces to redeem them. Whil&s;t the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> lay fruitle&s;sly in tho&s;e Parts, a Party of Hor&s;e and Dragoons, under the <MILESTONE N="10"> command of <HI>Vandruske</HI> a <HI>German,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed by him without interruption, to the relief of <HI>Taunton,</HI> then blocked up by Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> and re|duced to &s;ome &s;treights; and accordingly effected it. About the &s;ame time, S^r <HI>Walter Ha&s;tings,</HI> Governour of <HI>Portland,</HI> &s;econded by S^r <HI>Lewis Dives</HI> (who had the Command of <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire</HI> as Colonel General) had &s;urpri&s;ed <HI>Weymouth,</HI> and po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed the Forts, and the upper Town, the Rebels having withdrawn them&s;elves into the lower Town, divided from the other by an Arme of the Sea, and of no con&s;iderable &s;trength: &s;o that the &s;peedy reducing that &s;mall place was not looked upon as a matter of difficulty. However, le&s;t tho&s;e Forces which had relieved <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Taunton,</HI> and were conceived to be much greater than in truth they were, &s;hould be able to di&s;turb the work of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> and for the &s;ooner expediting the bu&s;ine&s;s there, the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> now pretending that his Friends in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex</HI> and <HI>Kent</HI> were not ready for him, was by Order from <HI>Oxford,</HI> upon his own de&s;ire, &s;ent thither; whereby it was thought, both the work of <HI>Weymouth,</HI> and <HI>Taunton,</HI> would be &s;peedily effected. Thereupon the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> who&s;e right it was to Command in tho&s;e Countys as Field-Mar&s;hal of the We&s;t, being &s;ent down by the King to compo&s;e the di&s;orders there, upon the relief of <HI>Taunton,</HI> was, by &s;pecial Order, recall'd to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> le&s;t there might be di&s;pute of Command be|tween <MILESTONE N="30"> Him and the Lord <HI>Goring;</HI> the one being General of the Ord|nance, the other General of the Hor&s;e; but the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> was like|wi&s;e Field-Mar&s;hal of the We&s;t, in which the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> had no Com|mi&s;&s;ion to command.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s arrival about <HI>Weymouth,</HI> with his full &s;trength of Hor&s;e, Foot, and Dragoons, and Artillery, con&s;i&s;ting of above three thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and fifteen hundred Foot, be&s;ides what he found in tho&s;e parts, that place of &s;o va&s;t importance, was, by mo&s;t Supine negligence at be&s;t, retaken by that contemptible number of the Enemy, who had been beaten into the lower Town, and who were looked <MILESTONE N="40"> upon as Pri&s;oners at Mercy. The my&s;teries of which fatal lo&s;s were ne|ver enquir'd into; but with great plainne&s;s, by the Vote of the Country, imputed to General <HI>Goring</HI>'s natural want of vigilance; who thereupon retir'd with his whole &s;trength into <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire.</HI> His Highne&s;s, upon his arrival at <HI>Bristol,</HI> found the We&s;t in this condition; All <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire</HI> entirely po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by the Rebels, &s;ave only what S^r <HI>Lewis Dives</HI> could protect by his &s;mall Garri&s;on at <HI>Sherborne,</HI> and the I&s;land of <HI>Portland,</HI> which could not provide for its own Sub&s;i&s;tence: the Garri&s;on of <HI>Taun|ton,</HI> with that Party of Hor&s;e and Dragoons which reliev'd it, command|ing a very large circuit, and di&s;turbing other parts in <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire:</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Devon-&s;hire</HI> intent upon the blocking up of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> at one end, and open to incur&s;ions from <HI>Lyme,</HI> and prejudiced by <HI>Taunton,</HI> at the other end: the King's Garri&s;ons, in all three Counties, being &s;tronger in For|tifications
<PB N="489" REF="5570">
(which yet were not fini&s;hed in any place, and but begun in &s;ome) than in Men, or any Provi&s;ions to endure an Enemy: whil&s;t the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s Forces equally infe&s;ted the borders of <HI>Dor&s;et, Somer|&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Devon,</HI> by unheard of rapine, without applying them&s;elves to any enterprize upon the Rebels. <HI>Cornwal</HI> indeed was entire; but being wholely a&s;&s;ign'd to the blocking up of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> yeilded no &s;upply to any other Service, or to the providing its own Garri&s;ons again&s;t the time that they might be vi&s;ited by an Enemy.</P>
<P>S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> and <HI>Cromwell,</HI> marched together about this time towards the We&s;t, and pa&s;&s;ing through <HI>Wilt-&s;hire,</HI> had routed, and taken <MILESTONE N="10"> the whole Regiment of Hor&s;e of Colonel <HI>Long,</HI> the High Sheriff of that County, by his great defect of courage, and conduct; and &s;eem'd to intend an attempt upon General <HI>Goring;</HI> who was &s;o much &s;tartled with the noi&s;e, at a great di&s;tance, that he drew his Forces &s;o far We&s;t of <HI>Taunton,</HI> that <HI>Vandruske</HI> had an opportunity to retire with that Body of Hor&s;e and Dragoons with which he had relieved <HI>Taunton,</HI> to his fellows; whil&s;t the King's Forces repo&s;ed them&s;elves upon the Borders of <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> him&s;elf, and mo&s;t of his principal Of|ficers, taking that opportunity to refre&s;h at <HI>Exe$er,</HI> where they &s;tay'd three or four days in mo&s;t &s;candalous di&s;order, a $$eat part of his Hor&s;e <MILESTONE N="20"> lying upon free Quarter, and plundering to the Ga$es of the City; which, in the beginning of the year, was an ill pre&s;age to that people, what they were to expect. But finding that S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> made not that ha&s;t he apprehended, having borrow'd &s;uch Hor&s;e and Foot as he could pro|cure from <HI>Exeter,</HI> he return'd again towards <HI>Taunton,</HI> and gave his Highne&s;s an account of his condition.</P>
<P>THE Prince, being attended at <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> found no one thing provided, or one promi&s;e complied with, which had been made by them at <HI>Oxford:</HI> Of his Guards of Hor&s;e and Foot, which they a&s;&s;ur'd him, for the proportion of that County, &s;hould <MILESTONE N="30"> be ready again&s;t his coming, not one Man or Hor&s;e provided: Of the hundred pound a Week, to be allow'd by them towards his Highne&s;s's &s;upport, not one penny ready, nor like to be. So that he was forc'd to borrow from the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s own private &s;tore, to buy bread. And, which was wor&s;e than all this, we found plainly, that, what had been &s;o particularly, and po&s;itively undertaken at <HI>Oxford,</HI> was upon the confidence only of three or four Men, who were govern'd by S^r <HI>John Stawel,</HI> and M^r <HI>Fountain,</HI> without any concurrence from the re&s;t of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of that, or the other three a&s;&s;ociated Counties; and that they who had been &s;o confident, in&s;tead of forming and pur&s;uing any <MILESTONE N="40"> de&s;ign for rai&s;ing of Men or Money, were only bu&s;y in making Objections, and preparing Complaints, and pur&s;uing their private quarrels, and ani|mo&s;ities again&s;t others. So they brought, every day, complaints again&s;t this and that Governour of Garri&s;ons, for the riots and in&s;olences of the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s Soldiers, and, <Q>&startq;that tho&s;e parts of the Country which were adjacent to <HI>Sherborne,</HI> and <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> were compell'd&endq; to work at tho&s;e Fortifications;</Q> with other particulars, mo&s;t of which, they well knew, in that conjuncture of time, could not be prevented; and &s;ome of which were in them&s;elves very nece&s;&s;ary. Yet the Prince endeavoured to give them all encouragement; told them, <Q>&startq;that he was <MILESTONE N="50"> very &s;en&s;ible of all tho&s;e di&s;orders, of which they complain'd; and would redre&s;s them, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould di&s;cern it to be in his power: that the Forces under the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> were an Army by them&s;elves,

come down into tho&s;e Parts, before his Highne&s;s; and &s;tayed then there for their Protection again&s;t the power of <HI>Waller</HI> (which was ready to invade them) and the Garri&s;on of <HI>Taunton,</HI> which they con|fe&s;&s;ed infe&s;ted their whole County; that he was very de&s;irous that Army might move Ea&s;tward, a&s;&s;oon as they &s;hould put them&s;elves in &s;uch a po&s;ture, as might render them &s;ecure again&s;t their Enemies; wi&s;hed them to propo&s;e any Expedients, how the Fortifications of the Garri|&s;ons might be fini&s;hed, without &s;ome extraordinary help; or to pro|po&s;e the mo&s;t convenient one; and he would joyne with them; and de&s;ired them to proceed in their levies of Men, and Money, in the <MILESTONE N="10"> ways agreed on by Them&s;elves; and they &s;hould find all concurrence&endq; and a&s;&s;i&s;tance from him.</Q> But notwith&s;tanding all he could &s;ay or do, nothing was rea&s;onably propo&s;ed, or admitted by them, for the advance|ment of the publick Service.</P>
<P>BY this time, towards the end of March, S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> having advanced with his Hor&s;e and Dragoons, by <HI>Bath</HI> towards <HI>Bristol,</HI> in hope, as hath been &s;aid before, to have &s;urpri&s;ed that City by &s;ome treachery within, and being di&s;appointed there, retired towards <HI>Dor&s;et|&s;hire,</HI> and the edge of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> adjoyning to that County; where <HI>Crom|well</HI> expected him; the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> having, in the mean while, fallen <MILESTONE N="20"> into &s;ome of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s Quarters about <HI>Dorchester,</HI> and taken &s;ome Pri&s;oners, and Hor&s;es, and di&s;ordered the re&s;t. Upon a di&s;pute be|tween them&s;elves, or &s;ome other Orders, <HI>Cromwell</HI> retir'd to joyn with S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> towards <HI>Reading;</HI> S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> &s;tay'd in tho&s;e Parts, to intend the bu&s;ine&s;s of the We&s;t, but made no ha&s;t to advance, expecting &s;ome &s;upplies of Foot by Sea at <HI>Weymouth.</HI> <Q>So that the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> drew back to <HI>Bruton,</HI> and &s;ent to the Prince to de&s;ire, &startq;that two of his Council might meet him at <HI>Wells</HI> the next day, to con&s;ider what&endq; cour&s;e was be&s;t to be taken: accordingly the Lords <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Cole|pepper,</HI> the next day, met his Lord&s;hip at <HI>Wells.</HI></Q> Where, after long <MILESTONE N="30"> con&s;ideration of the whole State of the We&s;t, and of the great impor|tance of reducing <HI>Taunton,</HI> without which no great matter could be expected from <HI>Somer&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> propo&s;ed, and put the de&s;ign in Writing under his own hand, for the whole method and man|ner of his proceeding, <Q>&startq;that he would leave the gro&s;s of his Hor&s;e, and two hundred Foot mounted, in &s;uch convenient place, upon the skirts of <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Wilt-&s;hire,</HI> as they might be able to retire to their Body, if the Enemy advanced powerfully; and that he would him|&s;elf, with all his Foot, and Cannon, and &s;uch Hor&s;e as were nece&s;&s;ary,&endq; attempt the taking, or burning of <HI>Taunton:</HI> and to that purpo&s;e,</Q> de|&s;ired his Highne&s;s, <Q>&startq;&endq; to &s;end po&s;itive Orders to S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> (who, notwith&s;tanding his Highne&s;s's Commands formerly &s;ent to him,</Q> and &s;ome Orders from the King him&s;elf, made not that ha&s;t as might rea&s;onably be expected) <Q>&startq;to advance, and to direct the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Somer&s;et</HI> to give their Per&s;onal attendance upon that Service; and in the mean time to take care that &s;ufficient Magazines of Victual, and&endq; Provi&s;ions, were made for the Soldiers: all which was exactly per|form'd by his Highne&s;s, the next day after he receiv'd the de&s;ires of Ge|neral <HI>Goring.</HI></Q></P>
<P>BUT, within three or four days, and before the de&s;ign upon <HI>Taunton</HI> was ready for Execution, it appear'd by con&s;tant Intelligence, that <HI>Waller</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> was advancing with a great Body of Hor&s;e, and Dragoons, and &s;ome Foot; and therefore the attempt upon <HI>Taunton</HI> was for the pre&s;ent to
<PB N="491" REF="5590">
be laid a&s;ide; and the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> very earne&s;tly de&s;ired the Prince to command S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> who was now drawn near to <HI>Taunton,</HI> with eight hundred Hor&s;e, and above two thou&s;and Foot, be&s;ides Pio|neers, with all po&s;&s;ible &s;peed to march to him, that &s;o he might be able to abide the Enemy, if they came upon him; or, otherwi&s;e, to compel them to Fight, if they &s;tayed in tho&s;e fa&s;t Quarters, where they then were; which was about <HI>Shaftsbury, Gillingham,</HI> and tho&s;e places. The Prince accordingly &s;ent his commands po&s;itively to S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> <Q>&startq;to advance towards the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> and to obey all &s;uch Orders, as&endq; he &s;hould receive from his Lord&s;hip.</Q> But he as po&s;itively &s;ent his <MILESTONE N="10"> Highne&s;s word, <Q>&startq;that his Men would not &s;tir a foot; and that he had promi&s;ed the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Devon,</HI> and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> that he would not advance beyond <HI>Taunton,</HI> till <HI>Taunton</HI> were reduced; but that he made no que&s;tion, if he were not di&s;turbed, &s;peedily to give a good&endq; account of that place.</Q> In the mean time, the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> very gal|lantly and &s;ucce&s;sfully, by night, fell upon S^r <HI>William Waller</HI>'s Quarters twice, in le&s;s than a Week; and kill'd and took &s;o good a Number, that it was generally believ'd, S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> was le&s;&s;en'd near a thou&s;and Men by tho&s;e Rencounters; the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> &s;till declaring, <Q>&startq;that he could neither pur&s;ue his advantages upon a Part, nor engage the main&endq; <MILESTONE N="20"> of the Rebels, without the addition of <HI>Greenvil</HI>'s Foot;</Q> and he, not|with&s;tanding all Orders, as peremptorily refu&s;ing to &s;tir, but profe&s;&s;ing, <Q>&startq;that, if he had an Addition of &s;ix hundred Men, he would be in the&endq; Town within &s;ix days.</Q></P>
<P>WHILST things &s;tood thus, S^r <HI>William Waller,</HI> much weaken'd with the&s;e di&s;a&s;ters, and the time of his Command being near expired, drew back Ea&s;tward; and was, by night marches, retired as far as <HI>Salisbury,</HI> before the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> had notice of his Motion. Whereupon his High|ne&s;s, upon con&s;ideration how impo&s;&s;ible it was to overtake him, which General <HI>Goring</HI> him&s;elf confe&s;&s;ed by his Letters, or to engage the Forces <MILESTONE N="30"> under the Command of <HI>Greenvil,</HI> and the other Forces of tho&s;e parts, in any Action, before the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Taunton</HI> &s;hould be over (which indeed di&s;appointed all our hopes both of Men, and Money, in that great County) and on the other &s;ide, con&s;idering, if that place were reduced (as S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> undertook it &s;hould be in &s;ix days, and others, who had viewed it, thought it not a work of time) be&s;ides the terror it would &s;trike into their Neighbours, there would be an Army of four thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and five thou&s;and Foot, ready to be applied to any &s;er|vice they &s;hould be directed to, and that then the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> might pro&s;ecute his Commi&s;&s;ion in <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and <HI>Kent,</HI> with &s;uch a rea&s;onable <MILESTONE N="40"> Recruit of Foot as &s;hould be nece&s;&s;ary, and yet his Highne&s;s enabled, in a &s;hort time, to be in the head of a very good Army, rai&s;ed out of the four A&s;&s;ociated Counties, either for the reducing the few other places which were Garri&s;on'd by the Rebels, or to march toward his Maje&s;ty: I &s;ay, upon the&s;e con&s;iderations, the Prince (with the privity and advice of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who was then at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and pre&s;ent at the whole con&s;ultation, and the principal advi&s;er in it) writ, upon the eleventh of <HI>April,</HI> to the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> being then about <HI>Wells,</HI> <Q>&startq;that his opinion was, that the Hor&s;e and Dragoons under his Lord&s;hip's Command, &s;hould advance from the Quarters where they then were, <MILESTONE N="50"> much to the prejudice of that County, into <HI>Dor&s;et&s;hire,</HI> or <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> or into both of them; and that the Foot and Cannon &s;hould march directly towards <HI>Taunton,</HI> according to the de&s;ign formerly propo&s;ed
<PB N="492" REF="5600">
by his Lord&s;hip; and referr'd it to him&s;elf, whether his Lord&s;hip in Per&s;on would &s;tay with the Hor&s;e, or go with the Foot; and de&s;ired&endq; to receive his opinion, and re&s;olution upon the whole;</Q> there being nothing propo&s;ed to be acted in two days. This Letter was &s;ent by Co|lonel <HI>Windham,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> who came that day, from before <HI>Taunton,</HI> from S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil;</HI> and could be&s;t inform him of the &s;trength of the Town, and the condition of S^r <HI>Richard Green|vil</HI>'s Forces.</P>
<P><Q>THE next day Colonel <HI>Windham</HI> return'd, with a &s;hort &s;ullen Let|ter from the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> to the Prince, &startq;that he had, according to his <MILESTONE N="10"> command, &s;ent the Foot and Cannon to <HI>Taunton;</HI> and the Hor&s;e, to the other places; and that, &s;ince there was now nothing for him to do,&endq; he was gone to <HI>Bath</HI> to intend his Health: where he complain'd pri|vately,</Q> <Q>&startq;that his Forces were taken from him at a time when he meant&endq; to pur&s;ue <HI>Waller,</HI> and could utterly defeat him;</Q> and much inveighed again&s;t the Prince's Council, for &s;ending Orders to him &s;o prejudicial to the King's Service: whereas it was only an Opinion, and not Orders, grounded upon what him&s;elf had formerly propo&s;ed, and to which he was de&s;ired to return his pre&s;ent judgement, being within half a days Journey of the Prince, upon whom he ought to have attended in Per|&s;on, <MILESTONE N="20"> or have &s;ent his advice to him, if what was then offer'd &s;eem'd not convenient. But, after &s;ome days frolickly &s;pent at <HI>Bath,</HI> he return'd to his former temper, and waiting on the Prince at <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> was con|tented to be told, <Q>&startq;that he had been more apprehen&s;ive of Di&s;courte&s;ies&endq; than he had cau&s;e;</Q> and &s;o all mi&s;under&s;tandings &s;eem'd to be fairly made up.</P>
<P>THE Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s Foot and Cannon being thus &s;uddainly &s;ent to <HI>Taunton,</HI> under the Command of S^r <HI>Jo&s;eph Wagstaffe;</HI> for the better preventing any Mi&s;takes, and Conte&s;ts about Command, the Prince &s;ent the Lords <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Colepepper</HI> to <HI>Taunton,</HI> to &s;ettle all di&s;putes that <MILESTONE N="30"> might ari&s;e, and to di&s;po&s;e the Country to a&s;&s;i&s;t that work in the be&s;t manner; which prov'd very fortunate; for the &s;ame day they came thither, S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> having brought his Forces within Mu&s;|quet-&s;hot, on one &s;ide of <HI>Taunton,</HI> went him&s;elf to view <HI>Wellington-</HI>Hou&s;e, five miles di&s;tant, in which the Rebels had a Garri&s;on, and was, out of a Window, &s;hot in the thigh; with which he fell, the wound be|ing then conceiv'd to be Mortal: &s;o that there was no Per&s;on who would pretend to Command; tho&s;e under <HI>Greenvil,</HI> having no expe|rienced Officer of reputation equal to that charge, yet being Superior in number to the other, would not be commanded by S^r <HI>Jo&s;eph Wag|&s;taffe;</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;o that if the Lords had not very happily been pre&s;ent, it is pro|bable, both tho&s;e Bodies of Foot, each being too weak for the attempt by it &s;elf, would, if not disbanded, at be&s;t have retired to their former Po&s;ts, and left tho&s;e of <HI>Taunton</HI> at liberty to have done what they thought be&s;t. But they being there, and S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> being in that in&s;tant come thither to meet them, with an Account of the State of <HI>Devon|&s;hire,</HI> they per&s;waded him to undertake the pre&s;ent charge of the Whole (all the Officers of both Bodies having formerly receiv'd Orders from him) and to pro&s;ecute the former de&s;ign upon the Town; all Per&s;ons &s;ubmitting till the Prince's Plea&s;ure &s;hould be farther known; tho&s;e Of|ficers <MILESTONE N="50"> under S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> pre&s;ently &s;ending away an expre&s;s to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to de&s;ire the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> to take the Command of them. But his Lord&s;hip had no mind to enter upon any particular Action with di&s;|joynted
<PB N="493" REF="5610">
Forces, till, upon the withdrawing of the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> the whole Command might be Executed according to former e&s;tabli&s;hment. And &s;o a &s;pecial direction was &s;ent to all the Officers, and Soldiers, to obey S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> according to what had been formerly &s;ettled by the Lords. He, in few days, put the bu&s;ine&s;s in very good Order, and by Storm took <HI>Wellington-</HI>Hou&s;e, where <HI>Greenvil</HI> had been hurt.

<P>THE Prince, finding the publick Service in no degree advanced by the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and that though there was no progre&s;s made in the A&s;&s;ociation affected, and undertaken by them, yet it &s;erv'd <MILESTONE N="20"> to cro&s;s, and oppo&s;e all other attempts what&s;oever; tho&s;e who had no mind to do any thing, &s;atisfying them&s;elves with the vi&s;ible impo&s;&s;ibi|lity of that de&s;ign, and yet the other, who had fir&s;t propo&s;ed it, think|ing them&s;elves engaged to con&s;ent to no alteration; and his Highne&s;s being inform'd by a Gentleman (&s;ent by him, at his fir&s;t coming to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> to the two farthe&s;t We&s;tern Counties, to pre&s;s the execution of what&s;oever was promi&s;ed in order to the A&s;&s;ociation) <Q>&startq;that tho&s;e two Counties of <HI>Devon,</HI> and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> were entirely devoted to &s;erve the&endq; Prince, in what manner &s;oever he &s;hould propo&s;e,</Q> he thought fit, to &s;ummon the Commi&s;&s;ioners of all the A&s;&s;ociated Counties, to attend upon him in &s;ome convenient place, where, upon full con&s;ideration, &s;uch conclu&s;ions might be made, as might be&s;t advance the work in hand, both for the reduction of <HI>Taunton,</HI> and rai&s;ing a marching Army; which Coun&s;el had been &s;ooner given, and had in truth been fit to be put in practice upon his fir&s;t coming to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> when he di&s;cern'd the flatne&s;s, peremptorine&s;s, and unactivity of the Gentlemen of <HI>Somer&s;et;</HI> from whom it was evident nothing was to be expected, till, by the unanimity and &s;trength of the two We&s;tern Counties, that County could be driven and compelled to do what was nece&s;&s;ary, and to recede from their own &s;ullen and po&s;itive determinations; which had been ea&s;y to do, but that &s;hortly after his Highne&s;s came to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> upon what ap|prehen&s;ions no Man knew, there was great jealou&s;y at <HI>Oxford</HI> of his going farther We&s;t; <Q>and thereupon direction given, &startq;that he &s;hould not remove from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> but upon weighty rea&s;ons, and with which his&endq; Maje&s;ty was to be fir&s;t acquainted.</Q> <Q>Whereas, by his in&s;tructions, &startq;he was to make his re&s;idence in &s;uch a place, as by the Council &s;hould be&endq; thought mo&s;t conducing to his Affairs.</Q> However, &s;uch a Meeting with all the Commi&s;&s;ioners being demon&s;trably nece&s;&s;ary, and <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> thought at too great a di&s;tance from the We&s;t, be&s;ides that the Plague begun to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince &s;ummons the Commi&s;&s;ioners of the four A&s;&s;ociated We&s;tern Coun|ties to</HI> Bridge|water.</NOTE> break out there very much, for the time of the year, his Highne&s;s re|&s;olv'd to go to <HI>Bridgewater</HI> for a few days, and to &s;ummon thither the Commi&s;&s;ioners, the rather to give &s;ome countenance to the bu&s;ine&s;s

of <HI>Taunton,</HI> then clo&s;ely Be&s;ieged by S^r <HI>John Berkley;</HI> and to that pur|po&s;e, directed his Letters to the &s;everal Commi&s;&s;ioners to attend him there, on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the three and twentieth of <HI>April;</HI> the King being then at <HI>Oxford,</HI> preparing for the Field, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> at <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> levying Men, and the Rebels at <HI>London</HI> in &s;ome di&s;order and confu&s;ion about their new Model, having newly removed the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> and Earl of <HI>Manche&s;ter,</HI> Earl of <HI>Denbigh,</HI> and S^r <HI>William Waller</HI> from any Command, and Sub&s;tituted S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> General; who was, out of the other broken and allmo&s;t di&s;&s;olv'd Forces, to mould a new Ar|my, which was then in no very hopeful forwardne&s;s. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>UPON the day, the Prince came to <HI>Bridgewater;</HI> and was attended by a great body of the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> that place being near the center of that great County; there appear'd for <HI>Dor&s;et-&s;hire,</HI> as &s;ent from the re&s;t, S^r <HI>John Strangwaies,</HI> M^r <HI>Anchetil Grey,</HI> and M^r <HI>Ryves;</HI> for <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> S^r <HI>Peter Ball,</HI> S^r <HI>George Parry,</HI> M^r <HI>Saint Hill,</HI> and M^r <HI>Muddyford;</HI> and for <HI>Cornwal,</HI> S^r <HI>Henry Killegrew,</HI> M^r <HI>Coriton,</HI> M^r <HI>Scawen,</HI> and M^r <HI>Ro&s;corroth.</HI> The whole Body waited on the Prince the next morning; <Q>and were then told, &startq;that his coming thither was to receive Their Advice, and to give His A&s;&s;i&s;tance, in what might concern the peace and welfare of each particular County; and might <MILESTONE N="20"> be&s;t advance the General &s;ervice of the King; that if the A&s;&s;ociation which had been propo&s;ed, &s;eem'd to them, by the accidents and mu|tations&endq;</Q> which had happen'd &s;ince the time of that fir&s;t propo&s;al (as in truth very notable ones had happen'd) <Q>&startq;not fit now to be further pro&s;e|cuted, he was ready to con&s;ent to any alteration they &s;hould propo&s;e, and to joyn with them in any other expedient; and wi&s;hed them there|fore to confer together, what was be&s;t to be done; and when they were ready to propo&s;e any thing to him, he would be ready to receive&endq; it.</Q> After two or three days con&s;ultation among&s;t them&s;elves, they were unanimou&s;ly of opinion (except S^r <HI>John Stawel,</HI> who, again&s;t all <MILESTONE N="30"> the re&s;t, and again&s;t all that could be &s;aid to him, continued po&s;itive for the general ri&s;ing of One and All, and for that alone) <Q>&startq;that That de&s;ign was for the pre&s;ent to be laid a&s;ide; and that, in&s;tead thereof, tho&s;e Counties, according to their &s;everal known proportions, would in a&endq; very &s;hort time</Q> (as I remember a Month was the utmo&s;t) <Q>&startq;rai&s;e, and Arme, &s;ix thou&s;and Foot, be&s;ides the Prince's Guards, which would be full two thou&s;and more; not reckoning tho&s;e of the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s which were fifteen hundred, but including the Foot of S^r <HI>John Berkley,&endq;</HI> and S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> then before <HI>Taunton;</HI></Q> which all Men con|cluded, would be reduced in le&s;s then a Month. This Propo&s;ition be|ing <MILESTONE N="40"> approv'd by the Prince, all particulars were agreed upon: the &s;e|veral days for the Rendezvous of the new levies, and the Officers to whom the Men were to be deliver'd, named; and Warrants i&s;&s;ued out accordingly: all things requi&s;ite for the &s;peedy reduction of <HI>Taunton</HI> order'd, and directed; &s;o that, towards the taking that place, and the rai&s;ing an Army &s;peedily, all things &s;tood &s;o fair, that more could not be wi&s;hed.</P>
<P>AS this Journey to <HI>Bridgewater</HI> wrought this good effect, &s;o it pro|duced one notable inconvenience, and di&s;cover'd another. The Prince, having before his coming from <HI>Oxford</HI> been very little conver&s;ant with <MILESTONE N="50"> bu&s;ine&s;s, had been per&s;waded, from his coming out, to &s;it frequently, if not con&s;tantly, in Council, to mark, and con&s;ider the &s;tate of Affairs, and to accu&s;tom him&s;elf to a habit of &s;peaking, and judging upon what
<PB N="495" REF="5630">
was &s;aid; to the which he had with great ingenuity applied him&s;elf; but coming to <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> and having an extraordinary kindne&s;s for M^r^s <HI>Windham,</HI> who had been his Nur&s;e, he was not only diverted by her folly, and petulancy, from applying him&s;elf to the &s;erious con&s;idera|tion of his bu&s;ine&s;s, but accu&s;tom'd to hear her &s;peak negligently and &s;cornfully of the Council; which, though at fir&s;t it made no impre&s;&s;ion in Him of di&s;re&s;pect towards them, encouraged other People who heard it, to the like liberty; and from thence grew an irreverence towards them; which reflected upon him&s;elf, and &s;erv'd to bring prejudice to their Coun&s;els throughout the whole cour&s;e. She had many private de|&s;igns <MILESTONE N="10"> of benefit and advantage to her &s;elf, and her Children, and the qualifying her Husband to do all Acts of power without controul upon his Neighbours, and labour'd to procure Grants, or Promi&s;es of Rever|&s;ions of Lands from the Prince; and finding that the Prince was not to tran&s;act any &s;uch thing, without the Advice of the Council, and that They were not like to comply in tho&s;e enterprizes, &s;he contriv'd to rai&s;e jealou&s;ies and di&s;likes between them, and kindled &s;uch a faction in the Prince's Family, as produced many inconveniences. For from hence S^r <HI>Charles Berkley,</HI> who had a promi&s;e to be made Controller of the Prince's Hou&s;ehold, and M^r <HI>Long,</HI> who had the $$ke promi&s;e to be his <MILESTONE N="20"> Secretary, when he &s;hould be Created Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> (till which time tho&s;e Officers were never made) began to think they had injury done them, that they were not pre&s;ently of the Prince's Council, to which the places they were to have, gave them Title; though they knew well, that the Lords who then attended upon the Prince, were of the King's Privy Council, and in that capacity only, waited upon his Highne&s;s; and that the other were only of the Prince's own Council for his Reve|nue, and for the admini&s;tration of the Dutchy of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> for which his Highne&s;s had now his livery.</P>
<P>HOWEVER, the&s;e Fancies, thus weakly grounded, and entertain'd, <MILESTONE N="30"> made &s;uch an impre&s;&s;ion upon tho&s;e Per&s;ons, that they united them|&s;elves into a Faction, and prevail'd over the weakne&s;s of the Earl of <HI>Berk-&s;hire</HI> to joyn with them; and, by degrees, all of them joyn'd with all other di&s;contented Per&s;ons, to render the Council to be much neg|lected and undervalued. La&s;tly, &s;he being a Woman of no good breed|ing, and of a Country pride, <HI>Nihil muliebre praeter corpus gerens,</HI> va|lued her &s;elf much upon the power, and familiarity, which her Neigh|bours might &s;ee &s;he had with the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> and therefore, upon all occa&s;ions, in company, and when the Concour&s;e of the People was greate&s;t, would u&s;e great boldne&s;s towards him; and, which was wor&s;e <MILESTONE N="40"> than all this, &s;he affected in all Companies, where &s;he let her &s;elf out to any freedom, a very negligent and di&s;dainful mention of the Per&s;on of the King; the knowledge of which humour of hers, was one rea&s;on that made his Maje&s;ty unwilling his Son &s;hould go farther We&s;t than <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> &s;ince he knew <HI>Bridgewater</HI> mu&s;t be a Stage in that motion. This her ill di&s;po&s;ition was no &s;ooner known to the Lords, who were all ab&s;olute &s;trangers to her before, than they took care that his Highne&s;s &s;hould make no long re&s;idence in that Garri&s;on.</P>
<P>THE other inconvenience, that it di&s;cover'd, was the de&s;ign of the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> to have the command of the We&s;t. For then it grew very <MILESTONE N="50"> apparent, that, whatever had been pretended for <HI>Kent,</HI> or <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> he had, from the beginning, affected that charge; and, I fear, had &s;ome other encouragement for it, than was then avowed. And therefore,
<PB N="496" REF="5640">
from his fir&s;t coming into tho&s;e Parts, he had with great indu&s;try ca|re&s;&s;ed the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Devon,</HI> and e&s;pecially tho&s;e, whom he thought not well inclin'd to the Lord <HI>Hopton;</HI> whom, by all ill arts, he endeavour'd to undervalue; <Q>inveighing again&s;t &startq;the too great Contribution, a&s;&s;ign'd to the Garri&s;on of <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> and that any&endq; &s;hould be allowed to the Unnece&s;&s;ary Garri&s;on</Q> (as he call'd it) <Q>&startq;at&endq; <HI>Lamport;</HI></Q> which had been lately &s;etled by the Lord <HI>Hopton;</HI> and, as appear'd afterwards, was of va&s;t importance: tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es being mo&s;t popular to the Country, though mo&s;t pernicious to the King: and pro|mi&s;ed <Q>&startq;great &s;trictne&s;s and &s;everity of Di&s;cipline, if that Power under&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> the Prince might be devolved to him.</Q> To <HI>Bridgewater</HI> he came at the &s;ame time from <HI>Bath,</HI> <Q>upon pretence of &startq;vi&s;iting <HI>Taunton,</HI> and &s;ee|ing whether the work were like to be &s;oon done, that it might be&endq; worth the intending it.</Q> But, in truth, to drive on his Project for Com|mand with the Commi&s;&s;ioners; <Q>who were invited by S^r <HI>Peter Ball</HI> to make it one of their Propo&s;itions to the Prince, &startq;that the Lord <HI>Goring&endq;</HI> might be con&s;tituted his Lieutenant-General;</Q> which he him&s;elf had &s;o ab&s;olutely dige&s;ted, that, as if the matter it &s;elf had been out of que|&s;tion, he propo&s;ed privately to mo&s;t of the Prince's Council, the Rules that &s;hould be ob&s;erv'd between them in the Government of the Army, <MILESTONE N="20"> and the Admini&s;tration of the Civil part. Some, of no extraordinary kindne&s;s to <HI>Goring,</HI> wi&s;hed the agreement made, and Him &s;etled in the command, as the be&s;t, if not the only Expedient, for advancement of the King's Service, and for the &s;peedy forming an Army worthy of the Prince's own Per&s;on in the head of it; apprehending, that the dividing his Forces from the New levies, would leave a good body of Foot with|out an equal power of Hor&s;e, and without a Train, except a longer time were given for the making it, than the &s;tate of Affairs promi&s;ed to permit. But when <HI>Goring</HI> di&s;cover'd by his di&s;cour&s;e with &s;everal of the Council (with whom he communicated upon the Argument very <MILESTONE N="30"> freely, and expre&s;&s;ed in plain Engli&s;h, <Q>&startq;that except he might be &s;ati&s;|fied in the particulars he propo&s;ed, he &s;hould have no heart to pro|ceed&endq; in the publick Service,) that they would not con&s;ent to any Act that might reflect upon the Lord <HI>Hopton;</HI></Q> and that &s;ome of them had &s;uch a prejudice to his Per&s;on, that they would make no conjunction with him, he re&s;olv'd to compa&s;s his ends &s;ome other way; and &s;o pre&s;|&s;ed it no farther in any publick addre&s;s to the Prince at that time. <Q>It is not to be omitted, that he was then offer'd, and a&s;&s;ur'd, &startq;that, a&s;&s;oon as the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Taunton</HI> &s;hould be over, he &s;hould have &s;uch a Re|cruit out of the New levies, as would make up his own Foot three&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> thou&s;and Men, be&s;ides Officers;</Q> with which he might well pro&s;ecute his former de&s;ign; and, in the mean time, he had the ab&s;olute Com|mand; the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> not at all interpo&s;ing, or medling with the Army.</P>
<P>IT was now concluded by All Men who had well con&s;idered his car|riage and behaviour from his fir&s;t coming into the We&s;t, that, as he had form'd that de&s;ign in his own thoughts from the fir&s;t, of being about the Prince, and re&s;olv'd never to march with the Army under Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> (who&s;e nature was not agreeable to him) &s;o that he had pur|po&s;ely and willingly &s;uffered <HI>Vandruske</HI> to relieve <HI>Taunton,</HI> and even <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Weymouth</HI> to be again recover'd by that handful of Men who had been beaten out of it, le&s;t the bu&s;ine&s;s of the We&s;t might be done without him, by other Men; and that his pre&s;ence there might not be thought ne|ce&s;&s;ary.

For if <HI>Taunton</HI> had been reduced, as it mu&s;t have been if that &s;mall Party had not reliev'd it even in the la&s;t Article, he could have had no pretence to have &s;tayed in tho&s;e parts, but mu&s;t immediately have pur&s;ued his former de&s;ign upon <HI>Su&s;&s;ex,</HI> and tho&s;e other Counties, for which he had never any rea&s;onable foundation; or have continued his march to the King; which he had le&s;s mind to do.

But, at the &s;ame time, and whil&s;t that matter was in con&s;ideration, Letters came from his Maje&s;ty to his Highne&s;s and the Lords, expre&s;sly inhibit|ing his going farther We&s;tward; upon what rea&s;ons I cannot imagine; and thereupon the Prince him&s;elf return'd to <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> the thirtieth of <HI>April,</HI> having &s;tay'd at <HI>Bridgewater</HI> only &s;even days; and <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;ent the Lords <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exche|quer, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Upon which the Prince &s;ends three Commi&s;&s;ioners of his own to</HI> Exeter, <HI>and &s;o to return to</HI> Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> to <HI>Exeter,</HI> with in&s;tructions <Q>&startq;to examine all the complaints, and allegations of the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and to &s;ettle the bu&s;ine&s;s of the Con|tribution; and upon view of the &s;everal Commi&s;&s;ions of S^r <HI>John Berk|ley,</HI> and S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> &s;o to agree the matter of juri&s;diction,&endq; that the publick Service might not be ob&s;tructed.</Q></P>
<P>ASSOON as the Lords appointed by his Highne&s;s to go to <HI>Exeter,</HI> came thither, they went the &s;ame hour to vi&s;it S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> who was &s;till bedrid of his hurt. They intended it only as a Vi&s;it, and &s;o would not reply, at that time, to many very &s;harp, and bitter com|plaints <MILESTONE N="40"> and invectives he made again&s;t S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> (who was then at the Leaguer before <HI>Taunton)</HI> but told him, <Q>&startq;that they would come to&endq; him again the next day, and con&s;ider of all bu&s;ine&s;&s;es.</Q> Accordingly they came, when, with great bitterne&s;s, he again complain'd of the Go|vernour, and &s;ome di&s;re&s;pects from his Lieutenant Governour: but when he was pre&s;&s;ed to particulars, he mention'd principally &s;ome high and di&s;dainful Speeches, the mo&s;t of which were denied by the other, and the withholding &s;ome Pri&s;oners from him, which he had &s;ent his Mar&s;hal for near <HI>Taunton.</HI> The truth of which, was this; whil&s;t S^r <HI>Richard</HI> was before <HI>Taunton,</HI> he had &s;ent for one M^r <HI>Syms,</HI> a Ju&s;tice of <MILESTONE N="50"> Peace of the County, a rich and decrepit Man, who liv'd within three miles of that Town. He charged him with &s;ome inclinations to the Re|bels, and of favouring their proceedings. The Gentleman &s;tood upon
<PB N="499" REF="5670">
his ju&s;tification, and innocency, and de&s;ired to be put upon any Trial. <Q>However, S^r <HI>Richard</HI> told him, &startq;he was a Traytor, and &s;hould redeem&endq; him&s;elf at a thou&s;and pound, or el&s;e he would proceed in another way;</Q> and gave him three days to provide the Money. Before the time ex|pired, S^r <HI>Richard</HI> was hurt, and carried to <HI>Exeter;</HI> whither he no &s;ooner came, but he di&s;patched his Mar&s;hal to fetch M^r <HI>Syms</HI> to him; who ap|peal'd to S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> (who had then the Command) and de&s;ired to be put upon any Trial; and (be&s;ides that he was of a very infirm body, and unfit for Travel) many Gentlemen of the be&s;t quality gave him a very good te&s;timony, and undertook for his appearance, when ever he <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;hould be called upon. Upon this, S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> di&s;charged the Mar|&s;hal, and writ a very civil Letter to S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> of the whole matter; <Q>&startq;and that he would &s;ee the Gentleman forth coming upon the lea&s;t warning; but that it would be an Act of great cruelty, to carry&endq; him a Pri&s;oner, in that indi&s;po&s;ition of health, from his Hou&s;e.</Q> S^r <HI>Richard</HI> look'd upon this as the robbing him of a thou&s;and pounds, and writ &s;uch a Letter to S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> &s;o full of ill Language, and re|proach, as I have never &s;een the like From, and To a Gentleman; and complain'd to us of the Injury. <Q>We told him, &startq;&endq; that neither He, nor S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI></Q> had any Authority to meddle with M^r <HI>Syms,</HI> or any <MILESTONE N="20"> <Q>&startq;Per&s;ons of that Quality; who could not be look'd upon as Pri&s;oners of War; but if in truth he &s;hould prove to be a Delinquent, and guilty of tho&s;e crimes objected again&s;t him, his Fyne and compo&s;ition was due to the King, who had a&s;&s;ign'd the &s;ame to the Prince for the publick Service; and that there were Commi&s;&s;ioners, before whom he&endq; was regularly to be tried, and with whom he might only compound.</Q> <Q>He would not under&s;tand the rea&s;on of this, but in&s;i&s;ted upon &startq;S^r <HI>John&endq;</HI> <HI>Berkley</HI>'s protecting <HI>Syms,</HI> as a great indignity to him&s;elf.</Q> On the other hand, <Q>S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> complain'd by his Letters, &startq;that tho&s;e Sol|diers brought to <HI>Taunton</HI> by <HI>Greenvil,</HI> every day moulder'd away, and <MILESTONE N="30"> he had rea&s;on to believe it was by His direction; for that tho&s;e that &s;tay'd, and the Officers, were very backward in performing their du|ties; and that, after the taking of <HI>Wellington-</HI>Hou&s;e, he had com|manded that nothing &s;hould be done towards the defacing it, becau&s;e it might po&s;&s;ibly be fit to put a Garri&s;on into it, if the Siege &s;hould be rai&s;ed from <HI>Taunton;</HI> but that the Officer, who was under <HI>Green|vil,</HI> had, notwith&s;tanding &s;uch Command, burn'd it: That he proceed|ed in the levying Moneys, and &s;ending out extravagant Warrants&endq; throughout the County; and many other particulars.</Q></P>
<P><Q>S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> denied, &startq;that the Soldiers left the Leaguer, or <MILESTONE N="40"> that <HI>Wellington-</HI>Hou&s;e was burn'd by any direction of His: though it&endq; appear'd, that all &s;uch Soldiers as left their Colours and came to him,</Q> were kindly u&s;ed, and had Money given to them by him; and that Lieutenant Colonel <HI>Robin&s;on,</HI> after he had receiv'd Orders from S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> not to &s;light <HI>Wellington-</HI>Hou&s;e, rode to <HI>Exeter</HI> to S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> and immediately, upon his return from him, cau&s;ed it to be burnt. <Q><HI>Greenvil</HI> &s;aid, &startq;that he levyed no Monies, nor i&s;&s;ued out any&endq; Warrants, but what he had Authority to do by his Commi&s;&s;ion.</Q> <Q>In the end they &s;hewed him their In&s;tructions from the Prince, &startq;throughly to examine all differences between them; and, upon view of both their&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> Commi&s;&s;ions, to agree what limits each of them &s;hould ob&s;erve.</Q> Thereupon, he &s;hewed them his Commi&s;&s;ion in Paper, under his Ma|je&s;ties Sign Manual, atte&s;ted by the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> by which he was au|thorized

&startq;&endq; to Command the Forces before <HI>Plymouth;</HI></Q> and in order thereunto, with &s;uch clau&s;es of latitude and power, as he might both rai&s;e the <HI>po&s;&s;e,</HI> and Command the Train'd-bands, and indeed the whole Forces of both Counties; and was to receive Orders from his Maje&s;ty, and his Lieutenant General; and was likewi&s;e at that time&punc; High Sheriff of <HI>Devon.</HI> <Q>S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI>'s Commi&s;&s;ion was precedent, and more for|mal, being under the Great Seal of <HI>England,</HI> &startq;of Colonel General of the Counties of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and to Command the whole Forces&endq; of both Counties, as well Train'd-bands, as others;</Q> &s;o that, though their Commi&s;&s;ions were not in intention all one, yet they included <MILESTONE N="10"> clau&s;es, and powers, &s;o much the &s;ame, that either of them had Autho|rity enough to di&s;turb the other; and he that only &s;aw his own, might rea&s;onably think he had power over the other: which, between per&s;ons &s;o di&s;inclined one to the other as They were grown to be, might have proved very fatal, if the remedy had not been &s;o near by his Highne&s;s's Authority.</P>
<P>AFTER the peru&s;al of their Commi&s;&s;ions, they &s;hew'd him their In|&s;tructions, concerning the regulating the Contributions, in proportio|nable a&s;&s;ignments for the &s;everal Services; <Q>and de&s;ired his opinion, &startq;what Forces were now nece&s;&s;ary for the blocking up of <HI>Plymouth,</HI> &s;ince <MILESTONE N="20"> any attempt for the taking it was to be laid a&s;ide, at lea&s;t for a time? and that thereupon, &s;uch a&s;&s;ignation might be made to that purpo&s;e, as was &s;ufficient, and the re&s;t otherwi&s;e di&s;po&s;ed of. He told them, that the Forces then there (being about fifteen hundred Foot and four&endq; hundred Hor&s;e, of the <HI>Devon-&s;hire</HI> &s;ide) were &s;ufficient;</Q> and propo&s;ed allowance little enough for the Service; <Q>and then &s;aid, &startq;that it troubled him to be confined to &s;uch an employment, as the blocking up a place, whil&s;t there was like to be &s;o much Action in the Field; and therefore he hoped, his Highne&s;s would give him leave to wait on him in the&endq; Army;</Q> where he thought he might do him much better Service. <Q>They <MILESTONE N="30"> told him, &startq;&endq; they had Authority from the Prince</Q> (for &s;ome of his Friends had mention'd the &s;ame, &s;oon after he had receiv'd his Wound) <Q>&startq;if they found his health able to bear it, and his inclination led him that way, to let him know, that his Highne&s;s would be glad of his Service, in the moulding that Army which was then rai&s;ing; which, allowing two thou&s;and Foot to the recruiting the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> would be in view &s;ix thou&s;and Foot, and above two thou&s;and Hor&s;e with the Guards;&endq; in which he had de&s;ign'd Him the &s;econd place of Command.</Q> <Q>But then, they &s;aid, &startq;they knew not where to place the Command before&endq; <HI>Plymouth.</HI></Q> S^r <HI>Richard</HI> very chearfully receiv'd the Propo&s;ition for <MILESTONE N="40"> Him&s;elf in the Army; and for <HI>Plymouth,</HI> <Q>he &s;aid, &startq;no Man was fit to undertake the work There, but S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> who had the Com|mand of both Counties: that it was vi&s;ible by the differences and breaches that had been between Them, how inconvenient it would be to have that Charge independent; whereas, if it were in one hand, the unanimous con&s;ent of both Counties, and all the Forces in them,&endq; would more ea&s;ily do the bu&s;ine&s;s.</Q></P>
<P>ALL things being thus agreed upon, as far as they could be without S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI>'s con&s;ent, who was then before <HI>Taunton;</HI> the Lords re|&s;olv'd to return to the Prince, and in their way to di&s;po&s;e S^r <HI>John Berk|ley</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> to what had been propo&s;ed; and left the Chancellor of the Exche|quer at <HI>Exeter,</HI> to agree with the Commi&s;&s;ioners, upon the &s;ettlement of the Contributions, and to &s;ettle &s;ome other particulars which they
<PB N="501" REF="5690">
had re&s;olv'd upon. The whole Contribution of the County of <HI>Devon</HI> amounted to two thou&s;and pound Weekly; whereof &s;o many hundreds were a&s;&s;ign'd by the Commi&s;&s;ioners, for the maintenance of the Forces before <HI>Plymouth,</HI> as amounted to the ju&s;t proportion and e&s;tabli&s;hment propo&s;ed by S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> him&s;elf; and then &s;o many to the Gar|ri&s;ons of <HI>Exeter, Dartmouth, Barn&s;table,</HI> and <HI>Tiverton,</HI> as amounted to the payment of &s;uch Forces, as, on all hands, were agreed to be ab&s;o|lutely nece&s;&s;ary for their defence, at the lowe&s;t e&s;tabli&s;hment. All which being done, upon &s;uppo&s;ition that the whole Contribution, being two thou&s;and pound Weekly, would be, according to the A&s;&s;ignments, exact|ly <MILESTONE N="10"> paid, there remained not a penny overplus, for the buying Ammuni|tion and Arms, for the fini&s;hing Fortifications, for victualling the Gar|ri&s;ons, or for blocking up of <HI>Lyme;</HI> which if it were not done, all that part of the Country would be liable to that pre&s;&s;ure; and &s;o, unable to pay Contribution where it was a&s;&s;ign'd: But it was &s;uppo&s;ed, the la&s;t might be done by drawing out &s;ome Numbers from the &s;everal Gar|ri&s;ons, if there were no di&s;turbance from abroad; and the re&s;t mu&s;t be &s;upplied out of the Exci&s;e (the major part whereof was by the King a&s;&s;igned for the Support of the Prince&s;s <HI>Henrie$$a</HI> left at <HI>Exeter)</HI> and &s;ome other extraordinary ways to be thought of; the Letter Money <MILESTONE N="20"> and Sub&s;cription Money being almo&s;t exhau&s;ted.</P>
<P>HIS Highne&s;s was no &s;ooner return'd to <HI>Bristol</HI> from <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Goring <HI>joyns the King at</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> which was on the la&s;t day of <HI>April,</HI> than General <HI>Goring</HI> was &s;ent for by the King, to draw his Hor&s;e and Dragoons towards <HI>Oxford;</HI> that there|by his Maje&s;ty might free him&s;elf from <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who, with a very &s;trong Party of Hor&s;e and Dragoons, lay in wait, to interrupt his joyn|ing with Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> about <HI>Worcester.</HI> How unwelcome &s;oever the&s;e Orders were to the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> yet there was no remedy but he mu&s;t obey them: and it was now hoped, that the We&s;t &s;hould be hereafter freed from him, where he was at that time very ungracious. He march|ed <MILESTONE N="30"> with that expedition towards the King, who was then at <HI>Woodstock,</HI> that he fell upon a Hor&s;e Quarter of <HI>Cromwell</HI>'s, and another Party of <HI>Fairfax</HI>'s Hor&s;e, as they were attempting a pa&s;&s;age over the River of <HI>I&s;is,</HI> &s;o pro&s;perou&s;ly (the very Evening before he came to the King) that he broke and defeated them with a great &s;laughter, which gave him great Reputation, and made him exceedingly Welcome: and it was indeed a very &s;ea&s;onable Action, to di&s;countenance, and break &s;uch a Party, in the Infancy of their new model; and did break their pre&s;ent Mea&s;ures, and made <HI>Fairfax</HI> to appoint a new place of Rendezvous for his new Army, at a greater di&s;tance from the King's Forces. <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>PRINCE <HI>Rupert,</HI> who now met with very little oppo&s;ition in Coun|cil, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Re&s;olutions taken at</HI> Ox|ford.</NOTE> had, throughout the Winter, di&s;po&s;ed the King to re&s;olve <Q>&startq;to march Northwards, and to fall upon the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army in <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> before <HI>Fairfax</HI> &s;hould be able to perfect his new Model to that degree, as to&endq; take the field.</Q> This de&s;ign was not unrea&s;onable; nor the Prince to blame for de&s;iring to take revenge on them for what pa&s;&s;ed the la&s;t year; which, now they were &s;eparated from the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> who had in|deed defeated him, he believed was ea&s;ie to be done. That purpo&s;e of marching Northward was now the more ha&s;tned, that in the way, <HI>Che|ster</HI> might be relieved; which was clo&s;ely be&s;ieg'd; and then they might <MILESTONE N="50"> come &s;oon enough to <HI>Pontefract-</HI>Ca&s;tle, before which the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army then was; and if they could defeat That, the King would be again, up|on the matter, Ma&s;ter of the North: which, by the in&s;olence of the

<HI>Scots,</HI> and the di&s;like they had of the new Model, was conceiv'd to be better affected than ever. The next day after <HI>Goring</HI> came to the King, the Army was drawn to a Rendezvous, and con&s;i&s;ted then of five thou|&s;and Foot, and above &s;ix thou&s;and Hor&s;e; an Army not to be rea&s;onably le&s;&s;ened in the beginning of a Campagne, when the King was to expect he &s;hould have &s;o much to do; and if it had been kept together, it is very probable, that the Summer might have been crown'd with bet|ter &s;ucce&s;s.</P>
<P>FAIRFAX was then about <HI>Newbury,</HI> not in readine&s;s to march; yet reported to be much more unready than he was. It was &s;aid, that his <MILESTONE N="10"> de&s;ign was to carry his whole Army to the relief of <HI>Taunton,</HI> brought almo&s;t to extremity; which if he could bring to pa&s;s, would give him great reputation, and would make the Parliament near Sharers with the King in the intere&s;t of the We&s;t. <Q>Upon this pro&s;pect, it was thought rea&s;onable, and accordingly propo&s;ed, &startq;that the King him&s;elf would march with his Army into the We&s;t; and thereby, not only prevent the relief of <HI>Taunton,</HI> but compel <HI>Fairfax</HI> to fight, before he &s;hould be able to joyn with <HI>Cromwell;</HI> who had not yet gathered his Troops&endq; together.</Q> This was the concurrent advice of the whole Council with which the King u&s;ed to con&s;ult, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> only excepted, and <MILESTONE N="20"> S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> who commanded the Northern Hor&s;e; which were impatient to be in their own Country. Now the very contrary Affections towards each other, between Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> and the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> began to cooperate to one and the &s;ame end. The Prince found that <HI>Goring,</HI> as a Man of a ready Wit, and an excellent Speaker, was like to have mo&s;t credit with the King in all debates; and was jealous, that, by his Friend&s;hip with the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> he would quickly get &s;uch an Intere&s;t with his Maje&s;ty, that his own credit would be much Eclip&s;ed. Hereupon, he did no le&s;s de&s;ire that <HI>Goring</HI> &s;hould return again into the We&s;t, than <HI>Goring</HI> did, not to remain where Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> command|ed. <MILESTONE N="30"> This produced a great Confidence and Friend&s;hip between them, and the Prince told him all that any of the Council had &s;poken freely to him, when his Highne&s;s abhorred nothing more than that <HI>Goring</HI> &s;hould be near the Prince of <HI>Wales;</HI> and <HI>Goring</HI> &s;aid all of the Council, which he believ'd would mo&s;t irreconcile him to them. So they both agreed to do all they could, to le&s;&s;en the Credit and Authority of the Council. The King was de&s;ir'd to receive the Information, and State of the We&s;t, from <HI>Goring;</HI> who, upon the late good Fortune he had, and by the Ar|tifices of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> was too ea&s;ily believ'd. <Q>He inform'd the King with all imaginable confidence, &startq;that if, by the po&s;itive Command of <MILESTONE N="40"> the Prince, contrary to his opinion and advice, his Forces had not been taken from him, and applied to the Siege of <HI>Taunton,</HI> he had doubt|le&s;s totally ruined all <HI>Waller</HI>'s Forces, and prevented the coming of tho&s;e Parties who had given his Maje&s;ty &s;o much trouble at <HI>Oxford:</HI> that he had been always u&s;ed, upon his re&s;ort to the Prince, with great di&s;re&s;pect, being not call'd into the Council, but put to an attendance&endq; without, among&s;t inferior Suiters;</Q> and then told many particular pa&s;|&s;ages at <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> of which he rai&s;ed advantage to him&s;elf, upon the prejudice he begot to others.</P>
<P>WHEREAS the truth of the de&s;ign upon <HI>Taunton</HI> is before &s;et down, <MILESTONE N="50"> with all the circum&s;tances; and <HI>Waller</HI> was marched beyond <HI>Salisbury,</HI> before the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> knew where he was; and confe&s;&s;ed, there was no overtaking him; and he had always receiv'd as much re&s;pect from

<P>WHEN <HI>Goring</HI> was thus &s;eparated from the King's Army, his Ma|je&s;ty marched to <HI>Eve&s;ham;</HI> and in his way, drew out his Garri&s;on from <HI>Cambden-</HI>Hou&s;e; which had brought no other benefit to the Publick, than the enriching the licentious Governour thereof; who exerci&s;ed an illimited Tyranny over the whole Country, and took his leave of it, in wantonly burning the Noble Structure, where he had too long inha|bited, and which, not many years before, had co&s;t above thirty thou&s;and pounds the building.

<P>THEY had no Town &s;o con&s;iderable near the place where the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King Storms, and takes</HI> Leice|&s;ter.</NOTE> then was, as <HI>Leice&s;ter;</HI> in which there was a good Garri&s;on, under the Command of S^r <HI>Robert Pye;</HI> and Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> who was allways plea&s;ed with any brisk attempt, chearfully entertain'd the fir&s;t motion, and &s;ent S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> forthwith to &s;urround it (which was of great extent) with his Hor&s;e; and the next day, being the la&s;t of <HI>May,</HI> the whole Army was drawn about the Town, and the Prince, having taken a view of it, commanded a Battery to be forthwith rai&s;ed again&s;t an old high &s;tone Wall, on the South &s;ide of the Town; which, by his own <MILESTONE N="20"> continued pre&s;ence, was fini&s;hed with admirable diligence: which done, he &s;ent a Summons to the Governour; who return'd not &s;uch an An&s;wer as was required. Thereupon, the Battery began to play; and, in the &s;pace of four hours, made &s;uch a Breach, that it was thought Coun|&s;elable, the &s;ame night to make a general A&s;&s;ault with the whole Army, in &s;everal places; but principally at the Breach; which was defended with great courage, and re&s;olution; in&s;omuch, that the King's Forces were twice repul&s;ed with great lo&s;s, and &s;laughter; and were even ready to draw off in de&s;pair: when another Party, on the other &s;ide of the Town, under the Command of Colonel <HI>Page,</HI> &s;econded by a Body of <MILESTONE N="30"> Hor&s;e that came but that day from <HI>Newarke,</HI> and, putting them&s;elves on Foot, advanced, with their Swords and Pi&s;tols, with the other, enter'd the Town; and made way for their fellows to follow them: &s;o that, by the break of day, the A&s;&s;ault having continued all the night, all the King's Army enter'd the Line. Then the Governour, and all the Officers and Soldiers, to the Number of twelve hundred, threw down their Armes, and became Pri&s;oners of War: whil&s;t the Conquerors pur&s;ued their advantage, with the u&s;ual Licence of rapine, and plunder, and mi&s;erably &s;acked the whole Town, without any di&s;tinction of Per&s;ons, or Places; Churches, and Ho&s;pitals, as well as other Hou&s;es, were made <MILESTONE N="40"> a Prey to the enraged, and greedy Soldier, to the exceeding regret of the King; who well knew, that, how di&s;affected &s;oever that Town was generally, there were yet many who had faithful hearts to him, and who he heartily wi&s;hed might be di&s;tingui&s;hed from the re&s;t: but tho&s;e Sea&s;ons admit no difference of Per&s;ons. Though the place was well gotten, becau&s;e &s;o little time had been &s;pent in the getting it, yet it was not without very con&s;iderable lo&s;s on the King's &s;ide; there being near two hundred Soldiers dead upon the places of A&s;&s;ault, with many Of|ficers; Colonel <HI>Saint George,</HI> and others of Name; be&s;ides many more wounded, and maimed. The King pre&s;ently made the Lord <HI>Lough|borough,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> a younger Son of the Earl of <HI>Huntington,</HI> and one who had &s;erv'd him eminently from the beginning of the War, Governour of <HI>Leice&s;ter;</HI> and S^r <HI>Mathew Appleyard,</HI> a Soldier of known courage and experience, his Lieutenant Governour.</P>

THE taking of <HI>Leice&s;ter,</HI> the chief Town of that Province, even as &s;oon as he came before it, and in that manner, purely by an Act of great courage, gave the King's Army great reputation, and made a wonder|ful impre&s;&s;ion of terror upon the hearts of tho&s;e at <HI>We&s;tmin&s;ter;</HI> who now revolv'd the conditions, which were offered at <HI>Uxbridge;</HI> which they had refus'd. <Q>They began to cur&s;e their new model; and to reproach tho&s;e who had per&s;waded them &startq;&s;o ingratefully to throw off their old General, who was ready to foment all their di&s;contents. It was not above twenty days, that the King's Army had been in the Field, and in that &s;hort time, it had reduced two &s;trong Garri&s;ons of Theirs, <MILESTONE N="10"> without giving the Soldiers any conditions, <HI>Hawke&s;ly-</HI>Hou&s;e in <HI>Wor|ce&s;ter-&s;hire,</HI> and the Town of <HI>Leicester:</HI> whil&s;t their new General <HI>Fair|fax</HI> had only faced <HI>Oxford</HI> at a di&s;tance, to try whether the Ladies would prevail for the giving up of the Town, to pacify their fears; and had attempted to take a poor hou&s;e that lay near, <HI>Bor&s;tall-</HI>Hou&s;e, and had been beaten from thence with con&s;iderable lo&s;s, and had drawn off&endq; from both, very little to his honour.</Q> The&s;e di&s;cour&s;es were &s;o pub|lick in the City, and had &s;o much credit in both Hou&s;es of Parliament, that they exceedingly de&s;ir'd Peace, and exerci&s;ed their thoughts only how they might revive the old Treaty, or &s;et a new one on foot; when <MILESTONE N="20"> the evil Genius of the Kingdom in a moment &s;hifted the whole Scene.</P>
<P>LEICESTER was a Po&s;t, where the King might, with all po&s;&s;ible Convenience and Honour, have &s;ate &s;till, till his Army might have been recruited, as well as throughly refre&s;hed. Colonel <HI>Gerrard</HI> was upon his march towards him from <HI>Wales,</HI> with a body of three thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot: and he had rea&s;on to expect, that the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> would be very &s;hortly with him with His Hor&s;e; for he was not de|parted from the King above four or five days, with tho&s;e Orders which are mention'd before (and with which he was &s;o well pleas'd) but that the King &s;aw cau&s;e to repent his &s;eparation, and &s;ent other Orders to <MILESTONE N="30"> recall him as &s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible. But the King's fate, and the natural un&s;teadine&s;s, and irre&s;olution of tho&s;e about him, hurried him into Coun&s;els very di&s;agreeable to the po&s;ture he was in. He knew not that <HI>Fairfax</HI> was gone from <HI>Oxford;</HI> <Q>and the Intelligence which &s;ome Men pretended to have receiv'd from thence, was, &startq;&endq; that it was in di&s;tre&s;s. The Duke of <HI>York</HI> remain'd there;</Q> the Council, many Lords and Ladies, who &s;ent Intelligence to their Friends, and all the Magazines were there; and if all the&s;e &s;hould fall into the Enemies hands, <HI>Leicester</HI> would ap|pear a very poor recompence. The&s;e particulars being unskilfully, yet warmly pre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e who could not be under&s;tood to mean ami&s;s, <MILESTONE N="40"> the King re&s;olved to march directly for <HI>Oxford;</HI> and in order thereun|to, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King marches back towards</HI> Ox|ford.</NOTE> within five days after the taking of <HI>Leicester,</HI> he appointed the Ren|dezvous for his Army; where he might yet very rea&s;onably have been di&s;couraged from pro&s;ecuting that intention; for it then appear'd evi|dently, how very much it was weakened by, and &s;ince that Action, by the lo&s;s of tho&s;e who were killed and wounded in the Storm; by the ab|&s;ence of tho&s;e who were left behind in the Garri&s;on; and by the running away of very many with their Plunder, who would in few days have re|turned.</P>
<P>THE number of the King's Foot which remain'd, did not amount to <MILESTONE N="50"> above three thou&s;and five hundred; which was not a body &s;ufficient to fight a Battle for a Crown.

THE Army, thus di&s;po&s;ed in good order, made a &s;tand on that ground to expect the Enemy. About eight of the Clock in the Morning, it began to be doubted, whether the Intelligence they had receiv'd of the Enemy was true. Upon which the Scoutma&s;ter was &s;ent to make far|ther di&s;covery; who, it &s;eems, went not far enough; <Q>but return'd and averr'd, &startq;&endq;that he had been three or four Miles forward, and could nei|ther di&s;cover, nor hear any thing of them:</Q> pre&s;ently, <Q>a report was rai&s;ed in the Army, &startq;&endq;that the Enemy was retired.</Q> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> there|upon drew out a Party of Hor&s;e and Mu&s;queteers, both to di&s;cover, and engage them, the Army remaining &s;till in the &s;ame place, and po|&s;ture <MILESTONE N="10"> they had been in. His Highne&s;s had not marched above a mile, when he receiv'd certain Intelligence of Their advance, and in a &s;hort time after, he &s;aw the Van of their Army, but it &s;eems not &s;o di&s;tinctly, but that he conceiv'd they were retiring. Whereupon, he advanced nearer with his Hor&s;e, and &s;ent back, <Q>&startq;that the Army &s;hould march&endq; up to him;</Q> <Q>and the Me&s;&s;enger who brought the Order, &s;aid, &startq;that the&endq; Prince de&s;ired they &s;hould make ha&s;t.</Q> Hereupon the advantage ground was quitted, and the excellent order they were in, and an advance made towards the Enemy, as well as might be. By that time they had marched about a mile and an half, the Hor&s;e of the Enemy was di&s;cern'd to &s;tand <MILESTONE N="20"> upon a high ground about <HI>Na&s;eby;</HI> whence, &s;eeing the manner of the King's march, in a full Campagne, they had lei&s;ure and opportunity to place them&s;elves, with all the advantages they could de&s;ire. The Prince's natural heat, and impatience, could never endure an Enemy long in his view; nor let him believe that they had the courage to endure his Charge. Thus the Army was engaged before the Cannon was turn'd, or the ground made choice of upon which they were to Fight: &s;o that Courage was only to be relied upon, where all Conduct failed &s;o much.</P>
<P>IT was about ten of the Clock, when the Battle began: The fir&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Battle of</HI> Na&s;eby.</NOTE> Charge was given by Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> who, with his own, and his Bro|ther <MILESTONE N="30"> Prince <HI>Maurice</HI>'s Troop, perform'd it with his u&s;ual vigour; and was &s;o well &s;econded, that he bore down all before him, and was Ma&s;ter of &s;ix pieces of the Rebels be&s;t Cannon. The Lord <HI>A&s;tley,</HI> with His Foot, though again&s;t the Hill, advanced upon Their Foot; who di&s;|charged their Cannon at them, but over-&s;hot them, and &s;o did their Mu&s;queteers too. For the Foot on either &s;ide hardly &s;aw each other till they were within Carabine &s;hot, and &s;o only gave one Volly; the King's Foot, according to their u&s;ual cu&s;tom, falling in with their Swords, and the But-ends of their Mu&s;quets; with which they did very notable execution, and put the Enemy into great di&s;order and confu&s;ion. The <MILESTONE N="40"> right Wing of Hor&s;e and Foot being thus fortunately engaged and ad|vanced, the left Wing, under S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> in five Bodies, advanced with equal re&s;olution; and was encounter'd by <HI>Cromwell,</HI> who Commanded the right Wing of the Enemies Hor&s;e, with &s;even Bo|dies greater, and more numerous than either of the other; and had, be|&s;ides the Odds in number, the advantage of the ground; for the King's Hor&s;e were obliged to march up the Hill, before they could Charge them: yet they did their duty, as well as the place, and great inequality of Numbers would enable them to do. But being flanked on both &s;ides by the Enemies Hor&s;e, and pre&s;&s;ed hard, before they could get to the <MILESTONE N="50"> top of the Hill, they gave back, and fled farther and fa&s;ter than became them. Four of the Enemies Bodies, clo&s;e, and in good order, &s;ollow'd them, that they might not rally again; which they never thought of
<PB N="508" REF="5780">
doing; and the re&s;t Charged the King's Foot, who had till then &s;o much the advantage over Theirs; whil&s;t Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> with the right Wing, pur&s;ued tho&s;e Hor&s;e which he had broken and defeated.</P>
<P>THE King's Re&s;erve of Hor&s;e, which was his own Guards, with Him|&s;elf in the head of them, were even ready to Charge tho&s;e Hor&s;e who pur&s;ued his left Wing, when, on a &s;uddain, &s;uch a Pannick fear &s;ei&s;ed upon them, that they all run near a quarter of a mile without &s;topping; which happen'd upon an extraordinary accident, that hath &s;eldom fallen out, and might well di&s;turb and di&s;order very re&s;olute Troops, as tho&s;e were, and the be&s;t Hor&s;e in the Army. The King, as was &s;aid before, <MILESTONE N="10"> was even upon the point of Charging the Enemy, in the head of his Guards, when the Earl of <HI>Carnewarth,</HI> who rode next to him (a Man never &s;u&s;pected for infidelity, nor yet one from whom the King would have receiv'd coun&s;el in &s;uch a ca&s;e) on a &s;uddain, laid his hand on the bridle of the King's Hor&s;e, and &s;wearing two or three full Mouthed <HI>Scotch</HI> Oaths (for of that Nation he was) &s;aid, <Q>&startq;will you go upon your&endq; death in an in&s;tant?</Q> and before his Maje&s;ty under&s;tood what he would have, turn'd his Hor&s;e round; <Q>upon which a word run through the Troops, &startq;&endq; that they &s;hould <HI>march</HI> to the right hand; which led them both from Charging the Enemy, and a&s;&s;i&s;ting their own Men: Upon <MILESTONE N="20"> this they all turn'd their Hor&s;es, and rode upon the Spur, as if they were every Man to &s;hift for him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P>IT is very true, that, upon the more Soldierly word, <HI>&s;tand,</HI> which was &s;ent after them, many of them return'd to the King; though the former unlucky word carried more from him. By this time, Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was return'd with a good Body of tho&s;e Hor&s;e, which had at|tended him in his pro&s;perous Charge on the right Wing; but they having, as they thought, acted their parts, could never be brought to rally them&s;elves again in order, or to Charge the Enemy. That difference was ob&s;erv'd all along, in the di&s;cipline of the King's Troops, and of <MILESTONE N="30"> tho&s;e which marched under the Command of <HI>Fairfax,</HI> and <HI>Cromwell</HI> (for it was only under Them, and had never been remarkable under <HI>E&s;&s;ex,</HI> or <HI>Waller)</HI> that, though the King's Troops prevail'd in the Charge, and routed tho&s;e they Charged, they &s;eldom rallied them&s;elves again in order, nor could be brought to make a &s;econd Charge again the &s;ame day: which was the rea&s;on, that they had not an entire Victory at <HI>Edge-hill:</HI> Whereas the others Troops, if they prevail'd, or though they were beaten, and routed, pre&s;ently rallied again, and &s;tood in good or|der, till they receiv'd new Orders. All that the King and Prince could do, could not rally their broken Troops, which &s;tood in &s;ufficient Num|bers <MILESTONE N="40"> upon the Field, though they often endeavour'd it, with the mani|fe&s;t hazard of their own Per&s;ons. So that, in the end, the King was compell'd to quit the Field; and to leave <HI>Fairfax</HI> Ma&s;ter of all his Foot, Cannon, and Baggage; among&s;t which was his own Cabinet, where his mo&s;t &s;ecret Papers were, and Letters between the Queen and Him; of which, they &s;hortly after made that barbarous u&s;e as was agreeable to their Natures, and publi&s;hed them in Print; that is, &s;o much of them, as they thought would a&s;per&s;e either of their Maje&s;ties, and improve the prejudice they had rai&s;ed again&s;t them; and conceal'd other parts, which would have vindicated them from many particulars with which <MILESTONE N="50"> they had a&s;per&s;ed them.</P>
<P>I SHALL not &s;tay, in this place, to mention the Names of tho&s;e Noble Per&s;ons who were lo&s;t in this Battle; when the King, and the

Kingdom were lo&s;t in it; though there were above one hundred and fifty Officers, and Gentlemen of prime Quality, dead upon the &s;pot; who&s;e Memories ought to be pre&s;erv'd. The Enemy left no manner of cruelty unexerci&s;ed that day; and in the pur&s;uit kill'd above one hundred Women, whereof &s;ome were the Wives of Officers of Quality.

Nothing can be here more wonder'd at, than that the King &s;hould amu&s;e him&s;elf about forming a new Army in Counties which had been vexed, and worn out with the oppre&s;&s;ions of his own Troops, and the Licence <MILESTONE N="20"> of tho&s;e Governours, whom he had put over them; and not have im|mediately repaired into the We&s;t, where he had an Army already form'd, and a People, generally, well devoted to his Service; whither all his broken Troops, and General <HI>Gerrard,</HI> might have tran&s;ported them|&s;elves, before <HI>Fairfax</HI> could have given them any interruption; who had &s;omewhat to do, before he could bend his cour&s;e that way: of which unhappy omi&s;&s;ion we &s;hall have too much occa&s;ion to take more notice, after we have again vi&s;ited the We&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Sickne&s;s which infe&s;ted <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and which was thought to be <NOTE PLACE="marg">The Affairs of the We&s;t in the mean time.</NOTE> the Plague, had made it nece&s;&s;ary for the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> to remove <MILESTONE N="30"> from thence: and no place was thought &s;o convenient for his re&s;idence as <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> a plea&s;ant Town in the North part of <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> well Fortified, with a good Garri&s;on in it, under the Command of S^r <HI>Allen Ap&s;ley.</HI> And as his Highne&s;s was upon his way thither, he receiv'd the Orders which the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> who was now return'd, had procured from the King; which he carefully tran&s;mitted to his Highne&s;s, a&s;&s;oon as he arrived. At the &s;ame time, the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> receiv'd another Letter from the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> dated four days after the former Orders, by which he &s;ignified <Q>&startq;the King's expre&s;s plea&s;ure, that the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> &s;hould Command tho&s;e Forces in Chief; that S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;hould be Major General of the whole Army; that S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> as Colonel General of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> &s;hould intend the work before <HI>Plymouth;</HI> and that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> would &s;end his Ratification of all the&s;e; that the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> &s;hould attend his charge at the&endq; Army, as General of the Artillery.</Q> To which purpo&s;e, his Maje&s;ty with his own hand writ to the Lord <HI>Hopton;</HI> <Q>&startq;and that the Prince &s;hould not be in the Army, but keep his re&s;idence in a &s;afe Garri&s;on; and There, by the advice of his Council, manage and improve the bu&s;ine&s;s of the We&s;t, and provide re&s;erves, and reinforcements for the&endq; Army: with an Intimation,</Q> <Q>&startq;that M^r <HI>Smith</HI>'s Hou&s;e, near <HI>Bri&s;tol,&endq;</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> would be a convenient place for his re&s;idence.</Q></P>
<P>THE Prince and Council were much amazed at the&s;e orders and re|&s;olutions, &s;o different from tho&s;e which had been made; and therefore
<PB N="510" REF="5800">
they thought it fit to conceal them, till they might repre&s;ent faithfully to his Maje&s;ty the &s;tate and condition of tho&s;e parts, and their advice thereupon: well knowing, that if it were believ'd in the County, that the Prince's Authority was in the lea&s;t manner &s;uper&s;eded, or dimini&s;hed, be&s;ides other inconveniences, the hopeful levies, upon the agreement at <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> would be in a moment determined; <Q>the Gentlemen who were to rai&s;e Regiments, proce&s;&s;ing, &startq;that they would receive no&endq; Commi&s;&s;ions but from his Highne&s;s.</Q> But whatever care They u&s;ed to conceal the matters of tho&s;e Letters, and to ha&s;ten away a di&s;patch to the King concerning them, the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> took as much care to <MILESTONE N="10"> publi&s;h them; and from that time expre&s;&s;ed all po&s;&s;ible contempt at lea&s;t, of the Council attending the Prince. However, within three days, there was another change; for the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> (&s;ending at the &s;ame time expre&s;s Orders from the King to the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> to that purpo&s;e) by his Letters to the Lords of the Council, of the nineteenth of <HI>May,</HI> within five days after the former, &s;ignified <Q>&startq;his Maje&s;ties plea&s;ure, that the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> &s;hould march forthwith towards <HI>Northampton-&s;hire</HI> with all the Forces could be &s;pared; and that the Prince him&s;elf &s;hould&endq; &s;tay at <HI>Dun&s;tar-</HI>Ca&s;tle, and encourage the new Levies: it being</Q> (I pre&s;ume) not known at Court, that the Plague, which had driven him <MILESTONE N="20"> from <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> was as hot in <HI>Dunstar</HI> Town, ju&s;t under the Walls of the Ca&s;tle. <Q>At the &s;ame time, a Letter to the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> from the King, order'd him &startq;&endq; to Command the Forces under the Prince.</Q> The Prince was then, as was &s;aid before, in his way to <HI>Barnstable;</HI> having left five hundred of his Guards to keep the Fort in <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> the Garri&s;on being then very thin there, by rea&s;on of &s;o many drawn from thence for the Service before <HI>Taunton.</HI></P>
<P>GENERAL <HI>Goring,</HI> upon his return from the King, found <HI>Taunton</HI> reliev'd by a &s;trong Party of two thou&s;and Hor&s;e, and three thou&s;and Foot, which unhappily arriv'd in the very Article of reducing the Town, <MILESTONE N="30"> and after their Line was enter'd, and a third part of the Town was burned. But this Supply rai&s;ed the Siege, the Be&s;iegers drawing off with|out any lo&s;s; and the Party that reliev'd them, having done their work, and left &s;ome of their Foot in the Town, made what ha&s;t they could, to make their Retreat Ea&s;tward; when <HI>Goring</HI> fell &s;o opportunely upon their Quarters, that he did them great mi&s;chief; and believ'd that, in that di&s;order, he had &s;o &s;hut them up between narrow pa&s;&s;es, that they could neither retire to <HI>Taunton,</HI> nor march Ea&s;tward: and doubtle&s;s he had them then at a great advantage, by the opinion of all Men that knew the Country. But, by the extreme ill di&s;po&s;ing his Parties, and for want <MILESTONE N="40"> of particular Orders (of which many Men &s;poke with great licence) his two Parties &s;ent out, &s;everal ways, to fall upon the Enemy at <HI>Pe|therton-</HI>Bridge, the one Commanded by Colonel <HI>Thornill,</HI> the other by S^r <HI>William Courtney</HI> (both diligent, and &s;ober Officers) they fell foul on each other, to the lo&s;s of many of their Men; both the chief Officers being dangerou&s;ly hurt, and one of them taken, before they knew their Error; through which the Enemy with no more lo&s;s got into, and about <HI>Taunton;</HI> notwith&s;tanding which untoward accident, General <HI>Goring</HI> was, or &s;eem'd, very confident that he &s;hould &s;peedily &s;o di&s;tre&s;s them, that the place would be the &s;ooner reduced, by the relief that <MILESTONE N="50"> had been put into it, and that in few days they would be at his Mercy.</P>
<P>THIS was before the latter end of <HI>May;</HI> when, upon the confidence of &s;peedily di&s;patching that work, all po&s;&s;ible and effectual care was
<PB N="511" REF="5810">
taken to &s;upply him with Provi&s;ions, and to &s;end all the new levied Men, and his Highne&s;s's own Guards thither. In&s;omuch, as he had within few days a Body of full five thou&s;and Foot, and four thou&s;and Hor&s;e; which he Quarter'd at the mo&s;t convenient places; rather for ea&s;e, than duty; having publi&s;hed Orders, under pretence of pre&s;erving the Country from plunder, and with a promi&s;e of mo&s;t exemplary Di&s;ci|pline, <Q>&startq;that &s;ix pence a day &s;hould be collected for the payment of each&endq; Trooper;</Q> to which he got the Commi&s;&s;ioners con&s;ent; by virtue whereof, he rai&s;ed great Sums of Money, without the lea&s;t abatement of the former di&s;orders: yet he proceeded with &s;uch Popular circum|&s;tances, <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;ending mo&s;t &s;pecious Warrants out, and Declarations for Re|formation; <Q>&s;ometimes de&s;iring, &startq;that &s;olemn Prayers might be &s;aid in all Churches for him; and to de&s;ire God to ble&s;s &s;ome attempt he had&endq; then in hand;</Q> allways u&s;ing extreme Court&s;hip to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, (whom he barefaced inform'd, <Q>&startq;that he was to have, or rather, that he had the ab&s;olute Command of the We&s;t under the Prince, without&endq; reference to his Council) that with his Promi&s;es, Proclamations, and Court&s;hip, together with laughing at tho&s;e Per&s;ons they were angry at, he had wrought him&s;elf into very Popular con&s;ideration;</Q> till they found, that he promi&s;ed and publi&s;hed Orders, to no other purpo&s;e than to de|ceive <MILESTONE N="20"> them; and that, whil&s;t he &s;eem'd with them to laugh at other Men, he made them Properties only to his own ends.</P>
<P><Q>IN this conjuncture, the King's Letter came to the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> &startq;&endq; to march towards <HI>Northampton-&s;hire;</HI></Q> to which he return'd an An&s;wer by an Expre&s;s, before he de&s;ired the Prince's directions; though he was diligent enough to procure his Highne&s;s's opinion for the re&s;pit of his march. The truth is, the a&s;&s;urance that he gave of his reducing tho&s;e Forces within very few days; the leaving all the We&s;t to the Mercy of the Rebels, if he went before they were reduced; the danger of their marching in his Rear, and carrying as great an addition of &s;trength to <MILESTONE N="30"> the Enemy, as General <HI>Goring</HI> could carry to the King, except he car|ried with him the Forces of the &s;everal Garri&s;ons, which were then joyn'd to him, made it very Coun&s;elable to &s;u&s;pend a pre&s;ent Obedience to tho&s;e Orders, till his Maje&s;ty might receive the full and true State of his Affairs in tho&s;e parts; to which purpo&s;e, an expre&s;s was &s;ent like|wi&s;e by his Highne&s;s to the King. In the mean time, General <HI>Goring</HI> was &s;o far from making any advance upon <HI>Taunton,</HI> that he grew much more negligent in it, than he had been; &s;uffer'd Provi&s;ions, in great quantities, to be carried into the Town, through the mid&s;t of his Men; neglected, and di&s;couraged his own Foot &s;o much, that they ran away <MILESTONE N="40"> fa&s;ter than they could be &s;ent up to him; and gave him&s;elf wholely to Licence: in&s;omuch that &s;ome times he was not &s;een abroad, in three or four days together. At this time came the news of the fatal blow at <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> which freed him from any fear of being drawn out of the We&s;t; yet he u&s;ed no expedition to attempt any thing upon the Enemy, who were exceedingly di&s;hearten'd; but &s;uffer'd the Guards to be more negligently kept; in&s;omuch that his Quarters were often beaten up, even in the day time; whil&s;t &s;ome principal Officers of his Army, as Lieutenant General <HI>Porter,</HI> and others, with His leave, had &s;everal Parleys with the Officers of the Rebels, to the very great &s;candal of the <MILESTONE N="50"> re&s;t; who knew not what interpretation to make of it, at a time that he u&s;ed to mention the Per&s;on of the King with great contempt, and avow'd in all places a virulent di&s;like of the Prince's Council. Thus,
<PB N="512" REF="5820">
after about &s;ix Weeks lying about <HI>Taunton,</HI> the Forces whereof he pro|mi&s;ed to confound (I mean tho&s;e that marched to the relief of it) within few days, he was forced him&s;elf to retire, and &s;uffer them to joyn with S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax;</HI> who in the beginning of <HI>July</HI> marched towards tho&s;e parts.</P>
<P>AFTER the Prince came to <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> though he very &s;eldom re|ceiv'd <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince of</HI> Wales <HI>comes to</HI> Barn&s;table.</NOTE> any account from the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> of what happen'd, he was in|form'd by &s;everal Per&s;ons of Credit, <Q>&startq;that he was much di&s;contented; and expre&s;&s;ed a great &s;en&s;e of di&s;re&s;pect, and unkindne&s;&s;es that he&endq; had receiv'd.</Q> <Q>Therefore it was wi&s;hed by them, &startq;that &s;ome means <MILESTONE N="10"> might be found out, to &s;ettle a good under&s;tanding with him, where|by&endq; he might be encouraged to an Alacrity in &s;o important a Sea&s;on: and he having appointed to be at <HI>Tiverton</HI> on &s;uch a day,</Q> the Prince &s;ent thither S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> S^r <HI>Hugh Pollard,</HI> and Colonel <HI>A&s;hburn|ham,</HI> to confer with him, and to know what he de&s;ired; the Prince having never denied to a&s;&s;i&s;t him, in any one particular, he had ever pro|po&s;ed, or to grant him any thing he had expre&s;&s;ed a de&s;ire of. Upon their meeting there, he carried him&s;elf very high; <Q>&startq;talked only of gene|ral neglects put upon him by the Prince's Council; that he had been promi&s;ed by the King to have the Command of the We&s;t, but that <MILESTONE N="20"> They had hindered it; which affront he requir'd to have repaired, be|fore&endq; he would do any Service upon the Enemy;</Q> with many bitter invectives again&s;t particular Per&s;ons; <Q>&startq;whereof, he &s;aid, Prince <HI>Rupert&endq;</HI> had told him that &s;ome thought him not a Man fit to be tru&s;ted.</Q> They had indeed &s;poken freely to his Highne&s;s to that purpo&s;e, upon His very franckly di&s;cour&s;ing of him. In the end, the&s;e three Per&s;ons pre&s;|&s;ing him as Friends to deal particularly with them, what would &s;atisfy him; <Q>he told them, &startq;if he might be pre&s;ently made Lieutenant-General to the Prince, and admitted of his Council, and be promi&s;ed to be Sworn of the Privy Council, a&s;&s;oon as might be, and to be Gentleman <MILESTONE N="30"> of the Prince's Bedchamber, he would then proceed roundly and chear|fully in the bu&s;ine&s;s; otherwi&s;e, the Prince's Council &s;hould do the&endq; work Them&s;elves for Him.</Q> All this being &s;o extravagant, it cannot be thought any an&s;wer could be given to it, e&s;pecially it being &s;aid to them as Friends, and not expre&s;sly &s;ent to the Prince.</P>
<P>WHEN the Prince fir&s;t apprehended the advance of S^r <HI>Thomas Fair|fax</HI> to the We&s;t, he very earne&s;tly recommended to the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> the &s;tate of the Garri&s;ons about <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> e&s;pecially the Garri&s;on of <HI>Lamport,</HI> which was of &s;o great importance, that, being well &s;upplied it had &s;ecur'd <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> and all that part of the Country. This Gar|ri&s;on <MILESTONE N="40"> had been &s;etled by the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> upon his fir&s;t coming down to <HI>Taunton,</HI> after <HI>Vandruske</HI> had rai&s;ed the Blockade that Colonel <HI>Wind|ham</HI> had laid to it; and S^r <HI>Francis Mackworth</HI> (who, having been for|merly Major-General to the Marqui&s;s of <HI>New-Castle,</HI> was now, that Army being di&s;&s;olved, returning to his Command in the Low Coun|trys by his Maje&s;ties leave) was engaged by him, to take the Command of it till, upon the Prince's coming into tho&s;e Parts, a Worthier com|mand could be provided for him; and before the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s coming to <HI>Taunton,</HI> he had Fortify'd it to a good degree. This Garri&s;on, from the fir&s;t E&s;tabli&s;hment, had been much maligned by Colonel <HI>Windham,</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> who de&s;ir'd not to have another Governour &s;o near him, who was to receive &s;ome of the fruit that he had before looked on as his own, though never a&s;&s;ign'd to him: and then, upon &s;ome differences between S^r <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="513" REF="5830">
<HI>Stawel,</HI> and S^r <HI>Francis Mackworth,</HI> it was more inveighed again&s;t: in|&s;omuch as at the fir&s;t coming down of the Prince to <HI>Bristol,</HI> mo&s;t of the time was &s;pent in complaints from S^r <HI>John Stawel</HI> of this Garri&s;on, and of the forcing the Country to work, and contribute to tho&s;e For|tifications. After the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s coming to <HI>Taunton,</HI> he had, as a compliment to <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> and to all the Gentlemen, who were grown angry with my Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> upon their own fancies, be&s;ides the for|mer unkindne&s;&s;es he had to S^r <HI>Francis Mackworth</HI> upon &s;ome di&s;putes they had had in the North (where they were both General Officers) very much neglected, and oppre&s;&s;ed that Garri&s;on; not only by coun|tenancing <MILESTONE N="10"> all complaints again&s;t it, but by taking away all the Contri|bution a&s;&s;ign'd for the &s;upport of it, for the &s;upplying his own Army; and expre&s;sly inhibiting him by force to Levy tho&s;e Rates, which the Prince him&s;elf had a&s;&s;ign'd to him. In&s;omuch as when the Club-men of the County a&s;&s;embled together in great Numbers, and, having taken &s;ome Officers and Soldiers of that Garri&s;on Pri&s;oners, for requiring their ju&s;t Contributions in Money, or Provi&s;ions, came up to the Walls of <HI>Lamport,</HI> and di&s;charged their Mu&s;quets upon the Works, and S^r <HI>Francis Mackworth</HI> thereupon with his Hor&s;e Charged them, and killing one or two of them, forced the re&s;t to run away, the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> &s;ent him <MILESTONE N="20"> a very &s;trict reprehen&s;ion for &s;o doing, and po&s;itively commanded him <Q>&startq;&endq; to do &s;o no more; nor in any ca&s;e to di&s;turb or injure tho&s;e People.</Q> This brought that Garri&s;on &s;o low, that when it might have pre&s;erv'd that Army, it had not two days Provi&s;ions in it; S^r <HI>Francis Mackworth,</HI> having been called to wait on the Prince's Per&s;on, as well by his own choice (when he &s;aw the carriage towards him, believing that &s;ome pre|judice to his Per&s;on brought a di&s;advantage to the place) as by Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s advice; who promi&s;ed, when he left the Prince at <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> and vi&s;ited <HI>Goring,</HI> and <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> <Q>&startq;to &s;ettle that Garri&s;on of <HI>Lam|port,&endq;</HI> and make Colonel <HI>Windham</HI> Governour of it.</Q></P>
<P>HERE I cannot but &s;ay &s;omewhat of the Club-men; who began then <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Of the Club|men in</HI> So|mer&s;et <HI>and</HI> Dor&s;et-&s;hire.</NOTE> to ri&s;e, in great Numbers, in &s;everal parts of the Country, about the time that the Prince went from <HI>Bath</HI> to <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> in his Journey to <HI>Barn&s;table;</HI> and that night his Highne&s;s lay at <HI>Wells,</HI> which was the &s;econd of <HI>June,</HI> a Petition was deliver'd to him, which had been agreed upon that day at <HI>Mar&s;hals Elme,</HI> where there had then a&s;&s;embled five or &s;ix thou&s;and Men, mo&s;t in Armes; and the Petitioners were appointed to attend the next day at <HI>Bridgewater</HI> for an An&s;wer. It was evident, though the avow'd ground for the ri&s;ing was the intolerable oppre&s;&s;ion, rapine, and violence, exerci&s;ed by the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s Hor&s;e, that, in <MILESTONE N="40"> truth, they receiv'd encouragement from many Gentlemen of the Coun|try; &s;ome of them thinking, it would be a good Expedient to nece&s;&s;i|tate a Reformation of the Army; others believing it would be a pro|fitable Ri&s;ing for the King, and would grow into the matter of the fir&s;t A&s;&s;ociation, One and All. Therefore &s;ome principal Agents of S^r <HI>John Stawel</HI>'s were very active in tho&s;e Meetings; and he him&s;elf was very &s;ollicitous, that a very gracious An&s;wer might be return'd to their Pe|tition; which was follow'd by &s;ome Farmerly Men, and others of the Clergy, both which had good reputations of affection, and integrity to the King's Service. The Prince expre&s;&s;ed a great &s;en&s;e of the Oppre&s;|&s;ions <MILESTONE N="50"> they &s;uffer'd, by the di&s;order of the Army, which he promi&s;ed to do his be&s;t to reform; to which end, he writ many earne&s;t Letters to the Lord <HI>Goring.</HI> <Q>But his Highne&s;s told them, &startq;that this unwarrantable
<PB N="514" REF="5840">
cour&s;e of a&s;&s;embling together, and being their own Judges, would prove very pernicious: for though many of them might mean well, yet &s;ome active Mini&s;ters would mingle with them, on the behalf of the Rebels, and having once brought them to a kind of neutrality, and unconcernedne&s;s for the King, would, in a moment, be able, again&s;t all their good wi&s;hes, to apply them again&s;t him; and therefore &s;treightly inhibited them to meet any more in that manner, except they fir&s;t li&s;ted them&s;elves in Regiments, and cho&s;e Gentlemen of the&endq; Country to command them;</Q> to whom his Highne&s;s offer'd to grant Commi&s;&s;ions to that purpo&s;e. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THIS An&s;wer &s;eem'd to &s;atisfy tho&s;e who attended on the behalf of the Petitioners, until they were per&s;waded by &s;ome Gentlemen not to &s;ubmit to it; and &s;o they continued their meetings; many inferior Officers of the Army quitting their Charges, and living among&s;t them, and improving their di&s;contents. <Q>When the Prince went to <HI>Barnstable,</HI> he gave General <HI>Goring</HI> Adverti&s;ements &startq;of the great danger that might&endq; ari&s;e out of the licence that People took to them&s;elves;</Q> and therefore advi&s;ed him, <Q>&startq;as on the one hand, to &s;uppre&s;s and reform the crying Di&s;orders of the Army by good Di&s;cipline, and &s;everity upon enormous tran&s;gre&s;&s;ours; &s;o on the other, &s;ea&s;onably to di&s;countenance, and <MILESTONE N="20"> puni&s;h tho&s;e A&s;&s;emblies of Club-men; which would otherwi&s;e, in time,&endq; prove as dangerous to him, as any other &s;trength of the Rebels.</Q> But, whether it were to &s;hew his greatne&s;s, and &s;o, Popularly to comply with what the Prince had di&s;countenanced, or whether in truth he be|liev'd he &s;hould be able to make u&s;e of them, and per&s;wade them to be|come a part of his Army, he did u&s;e all po&s;&s;ible compliance with them, and would not &s;uffer any force to be u&s;ed again&s;t them. So that they grew to be &s;o powerful, that they kept Provi&s;ions from the Army, and the Garri&s;ons; and when he moved from <HI>Taunton,</HI> upon the coming down of S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax,</HI> they kill'd many of his Soldiers; and did <MILESTONE N="30"> him more mi&s;chief, than all the power of the Rebels.</P>
<P>WHEN the Prince came to <HI>Barnstable,</HI> he receiv'd the fatal news of the Battle of <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> by the noi&s;e and triumphs which the Rebels made in tho&s;e parts for their Victory, without any particular information, or account from <HI>Oxford,</HI> or any credible Per&s;ons; which left &s;ome hope that it might not be true, at lea&s;t not to that degree that di&s;affected People reported it to be. However, at the wor&s;t, it concern'd him the more to be &s;ollicitous to put the We&s;t into &s;uch a Po&s;ture, that it might be able to repair any lo&s;s the King had receiv'd; which he might have done, if the Jealou&s;ies and Animo&s;ities between particular Per&s;ons could <MILESTONE N="40"> have been reconciled, and a Union been made among&s;t all Men, who pretended to wi&s;h, and really did wi&s;h, pro&s;perity to the King's Affairs; which were di&s;turbed, and even render'd de&s;perate, by the intolerable pride of incorrigible Faction.

<P>THERE hath been too much &s;aid already, to di&s;cover the nature and the temper of this Gentleman, if the current of this di&s;cour&s;e did not make it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to mention many particulars, with which the Prince was troubled allmo&s;t in all places, and which exceedingly di&s;|order'd the whole bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Cornwal;</HI> and, indeed, thereby the whole We&s;t.

<P>THE Prince was very unwilling to enter &s;o far, and &s;o particularly upon the pa&s;&s;ionate complaint of either County, as thereby to be com|pell'd to cen&s;ure, or to di&s;countenance S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil;</HI> who, he thought, might be applied very u&s;efully to the Publick Service. There|fore his Highne&s;s re&s;olv'd, according to the former de&s;ign, to commit the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Plymouth</HI> to S^r <HI>John Berkley;</HI> who might, without any reproach to the other, di&s;charge &s;uch from Impri&s;onment as had lain long enough there, and who made no other pretence to the Contribu|tion, <MILESTONE N="40"> than according to the A&s;&s;ignments made by the Commi&s;&s;ioners; and to di&s;po&s;e S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> to the Field, according to his own Propo&s;ition; for which there was now the more &s;ea&s;onable opportunity, the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> having then written to the Prince, <Q>&startq;to de&s;ire him, that, in regard very many of S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI>'s Soldiers before <HI>Taunton</HI> were run away, in&s;omuch that of the two thou&s;and two hun|dred brought thither by him, there were not &s;ix hundred left, and that there could be no &s;uch expedient to bring them back, or to en|courage the new Levies, as by his pre&s;ence in that Army, that he would &s;end S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> thither; where he &s;hould Command&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> as Field-Mar&s;hal: to which purpo&s;e he had likewi&s;e written to S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI></Q> per&s;wading him, <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould fix a Quarter to|wards&endq; <HI>Lyme,</HI> and have the whole managing of that Province: and &s;o
<PB N="517" REF="5870">
a very good corre&s;pondence was begun between them.</Q> Thereupon, his Commi&s;&s;ion of Field-Mar&s;hal of the A&s;&s;ociated Army was deliver'd to him, with direction, <Q>&startq;&endq; in the mean time to abide with the Lord <HI>Goring;</HI></Q> who deputed him to Command in the &s;ame place. <Q>It is true that he then de&s;ired, &startq;to continue the Command before <HI>Plymouth</HI> in <HI>Commen|dam,</HI> and to execute the &s;ame by his Major General; but, he was told, that it was otherwi&s;e &s;ettled by his own Propo&s;ition, and Advice, and&endq; therefore that it could not be alter'd: and indeed would have pre|vented the &s;atisfaction, which was to be given to the two Counties.</Q> Then he in&s;i&s;ted very much upon &s;ome A&s;&s;ignment of Contribution for <MILESTONE N="10"> the Army; for, <Q>he &s;aid, &startq;he neither would, nor could Command Men&endq; who were not paid.</Q> But after &s;ome &s;harp invectives again&s;t the exce&s;s, and lazine&s;s of Governours, and the needle&s;s Contribution a&s;&s;ign'd to Garri&s;ons, finding that the &s;ub&s;i&s;tence for the Army mu&s;t be provided out of <HI>Somer&s;et,</HI> and <HI>Dor&s;et,</HI> he took his leave of the Prince; and with his Commi&s;&s;ion of Field Mar&s;hal, went to the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> before <HI>Taun|ton;</HI> S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> being at the &s;ame time di&s;patched to <HI>Plymouth.</HI></P>

He had been there very few days, when the Enemy, at Noon day, fell into his Quarters, upon a Party of Hor&s;e of above a thou&s;and, commanded by Lieutenant General <HI>Porter;</HI> who were &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed, that though they were in a bottom, and could not but di&s;cern the Enemy coming down the Hill, half a mile at the lea&s;t, yet the Enemy was upon <MILESTONE N="30"> them, before the Men could get upon their Hor&s;es; they being then feeding in a Meadow; &s;o that this Body was entirely routed, and very many taken; and, the next day, notwith&s;tanding all the Advantages of Pa&s;&s;es, and Places of Advantage, another Party of the Enemies Hor&s;e and Dragoons fell upon the whole Army; routed it; took two peices <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Beats</HI> Goring <HI>near</HI> Lamport</NOTE> of Cannon; and pur&s;ued <HI>Goring</HI>'s Men through <HI>Lamport</HI> (a place, which if it had not been with great indu&s;try di&s;countenanced, and oppre&s;&s;ed, as is &s;aid before, might well have &s;ecur'd His, and re&s;i&s;ted Their Army) and drove them to the Walls of <HI>Bridgewater;</HI> whither the Lord <HI>Gor|ing</HI> in great di&s;order retir'd; and &s;pending that Night there, and leaving <MILESTONE N="40"> with them the Cannon, Ammunition, and Carriages, and &s;uch Soldiers as were de&s;ired, in equal di&s;order, the next day, he retir'd into <HI>Devon|&s;hire;</HI> the Club-men and Country people infe&s;ting his march, and knock|ing all Straglers, or wearied Soldiers, on the head. Upon that rout, which was no le&s;s than a defeat of the whole Army, the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> retir'd to <HI>Barnstable;</HI> from whence (the Prince being gone &s;ome days before to <HI>Launceston</HI> in <HI>Cornwal)</HI> he writ to the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> <Q>&startq;that there was &s;o great a terror, and di&s;traction among his Men, that he was con|fident, at that pre&s;ent, they could not be brought to fight again&s;t half&endq; their number.</Q> <Q>In the Letter he writ, &startq;&endq; that he had then</Q> (being with|in <MILESTONE N="50"> three days after their rout, when very many &s;traglers were not come up) <Q>&startq;&endq; between three and four thou&s;and Foot</Q> (Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Regiment being left in <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> con&s;i&s;ting of above five hundred Men, and

two hundred in <HI>Burrow,</HI> and five and twenty hundred Hor&s;e, be&s;ides S^r <HI>Lewis Dives</HI>'s Regiment, and all the We&s;tern Hor&s;e) &s;o that, by his Ac|count, con&s;idering that there were not le&s;s than one thou&s;and Men kill'd, and taken Pri&s;oners, in tho&s;e two unlucky days, and that very many were run to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and others not come to him, it appears, that, when he ro&s;e from <HI>Taunton,</HI> he had a &s;trength little inferior to the Enemy.</P>
<P>S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> then no more pur&s;ued them, after this running away, but left them time enough to refre&s;h, and recover them&s;elves; whil&s;t he him&s;elf intended the recovery of <HI>Bridgewater;</HI> which was exceedingly wonder'd at; though it was quickly di&s;cern'd, he had good <MILESTONE N="10"> rea&s;on to &s;top there. In the mean time General <HI>Goring</HI> &s;pent his time at <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> and tho&s;e parts adjacent; his Army Quartering at <HI>Tor|rington,</HI> and over the whole North of <HI>Devon,</HI> and his Hor&s;e commit|ing &s;uch intolerable in&s;olences and di&s;orders, as alienated the hearts of tho&s;e who were be&s;t affected to the King's Service. In&s;tead of endeavour|ing to recruit his Army, or to put him&s;elf in a readine&s;s and po&s;ture to receive the Enemy, he &s;uffer'd all, who had a mind, to depart; in&s;o|much, as he writ to the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> on the 27^t^h of <HI>July,</HI> <Q>&startq;that he&endq; had not above thirteen hundred Foot left.</Q> When he was at <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> he gave him&s;elf his u&s;ual Licence of drinking; and then, inveighing <MILESTONE N="20"> again&s;t the Prince's Council, &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he would ju&s;tify that They had been&endq; the cau&s;e of the lo&s;s of the We&s;t;</Q> inveighing likewi&s;e in an unpar|donable dialect again&s;t the Per&s;on of the King, and di&s;cour&s;ing much of the revenge he would take upon tho&s;e who had affronted him: and in this manner he entertain'd him&s;elf to the end of <HI>July,</HI> writing Letters of di&s;content to the Prince, and the Lords; one day complaining for want of Money, and de&s;iring the Prince to &s;upply that want, when he well knew he wanted Supply for his own Table; and never receiv'd penny of the publick Collections, or Contributions: Another day, de|&s;iring, <Q>&startq;that all &s;tragling Soldiers might be &s;ent out of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> drawn from the Garri&s;ons, that he might advance upon the Enemy;</Q> and the next day propo&s;ing, <Q>&startq;that all the Foot might be put into Gar|ri&s;ons,&endq; for that they could not be fit for the Field;</Q> &s;o that before an An&s;wer could be &s;ent to his la&s;t Letter, another commonly arriv'd of a different temper.</P>
<P>S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> grew again no le&s;s trouble&s;ome and inconvenient, than the Lord <HI>Goring.</HI> He had left the Prince at <HI>Barnstable,</HI> well plea&s;ed with his Commi&s;&s;ion of Field-Mar&s;hal, and more that he &s;hould Com|mand alone the blocking up of <HI>Lyme;</HI> which, he re&s;olv'd, &s;hould bring him in plenty of Money; and in order to that, it was agreed, that, on <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;uch a day appointed, <Q>&startq;&s;o many Men from the Garri&s;ons of <HI>Dartmouth, Exeter,</HI> and <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> &s;hould be drawn to <HI>Tiverton;</HI> where they &s;hould receive Orders from S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> and joyn with &s;uch as he &s;hould bring from the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> for making a Quarter to|wards&endq; <HI>Lyme;</HI></Q> and Orders i&s;&s;ued from his Highne&s;s accordingly. Tho&s;e from <HI>Exeter,</HI> according to order, appear'd at the time; and tho&s;e from <HI>Barnstable</HI> and <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> marched a days journey and more, towards <HI>Tiverton;</HI> but then, hearing that the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> was ri&s;en from <HI>Taun|ton,</HI> made a halt; and &s;ent back to the Prince for Orders; who con|ceiv'd that, upon the ri&s;ing of the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> the de&s;ign of fixing a <MILESTONE N="50"> Quarter upon <HI>Lyme,</HI> would be di&s;appointed, and that it would be ne|ce&s;&s;ary to &s;trengthen <HI>Barnstable,</HI> where his own Per&s;on was; and re|call'd tho&s;e Men back thither; having di&s;patched Letters to S^r <HI>Richard</HI>

<P>S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> took an occa&s;ion, from the Soldiers failing to meet, at the day appointed, at <HI>Tiverton</HI> (though if they had met, there could have been no progre&s;s in the former de&s;ign) to exclaim again&s;t the Prince's Council; and, the next day, in a Cover directed to M^r <HI>Fan|&s;haw,</HI> who was Secretary of the Council, without any Letter, return'd the Commi&s;&s;ion of Field-Mar&s;hal, formerly given him by the Prince; <MILESTONE N="10"> and within two or three days after, on the fifth of <HI>July,</HI> he &s;ent a very in&s;olent Letter to the Lords of the Council, complaining of <Q>&startq;many&endq; unde&s;erv'd abu&s;es offer'd to him;</Q> implying, <Q>&startq;that the &s;ame were fa&s;ten'd on him by Them, on the behalf of S^r <HI>John Berkley;</HI> told them, that when they moved him to give over the Command of the Forces before <HI>Plymouth</HI> to S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> they had promi&s;ed him the Prin|cipal&endq; Command of the Army under the Prince: whereas the truth is before &s;et down, that the Propo&s;ition was made by Him&s;elf, both of quitting that Charge, and of S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI>'s taking it, as the only fit Per&s;on.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he had hitherto &s;erv'd the King upon his own Charge, <MILESTONE N="20"> and upon his own E&s;tate, without any allowance; and that, when he went from <HI>Bran&s;table,</HI> he was promi&s;ed a Protection for his Hou&s;e and E&s;tate; but when, after he was gone, his Servant brought a Pro|tection ready drawn, all the Clau&s;es that comprehended any thing of favour, were left out; and &s;uch a Protection &s;ent to him as he cared&endq; not for.</Q> <Q>He concluded, &startq;that he would &s;erve as a Voluntier, till he&endq; might have opportunity to acquaint his Maje&s;ty with his Sufferings.</Q> Here it will be nece&s;&s;ary, upon the mention of this Protection (which he took &s;o ill to be denied) and the mention of &s;erving the King, with|out allowance, upon his own E&s;tate, which he very often, and very in|&s;olently <MILESTONE N="30"> objected both in his Letters, and in his di&s;cour&s;e to the Prince him&s;elf, to &s;ay &s;omewhat of his E&s;tate, and what &s;mall allowance, as he pretended, he had from the King for his Service.</P>
<P>WHEN he came fir&s;t into that Country, he had no Command at all; armed only with a Commi&s;&s;ion to rai&s;e a Regiment of Hor&s;e, and a Re|giment of Foot; of which, he never rai&s;ed Hor&s;e or Man, till long af|ter, that he came to the Command about <HI>Plymouth.</HI> E&s;tate he had none, either there, or, that I have heard, any where el&s;e. It is true, his Wife had an E&s;tate, of about five hundred pounds a year, about <HI>Ta|vistock</HI> and other parts of <HI>Devon;</HI> but it is as true, that it was conveyed <MILESTONE N="40"> before Marriage, as hath been &s;aid, in &s;uch a manner, to Friends in tru&s;t, that upon long Suits in Chancery, and in other Courts, in the time of Peace, there were &s;everal Judgements and Decrees in Chancery again&s;t him. So that he had never, &s;ince the difference with his Wife, which was many years before, receiv'd the lea&s;t benefit, or advantage from it. The fir&s;t thing the King granted to him, was the Seque&s;tration of all his Wife's E&s;tate to his own u&s;e (&s;he living then in the Rebels Quarters) upon which Title he &s;ettled him&s;elf in her Hou&s;e near <HI>Ta|vi&s;tock;</HI> and, by virtue of that Grant, took all the Stock upon the Ground; and compell'd the Tenants to pay to him all the Arrears of Rent, or as <MILESTONE N="50"> much as he &s;aid was in Arrear; which amounted to a very con&s;iderable value. When Colonel <HI>Digby</HI> receiv'd his unfortunate hurt, which ren|der'd him for that time uncapable to exerci&s;e his Command, S^r <HI>John</HI>
<PB N="520" REF="5910">
<HI>Berkley</HI> very earne&s;tly, and He only, moved Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> to confer that Charge upon S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil;</HI> and, though it was within a County, of which he him&s;elf had the principal Charge as Colonel Ge|neral, procur'd a full Commi&s;&s;ion for the other to Command tho&s;e Forces in Chief; and deliver'd, or &s;ent the &s;ame to him; having, from the time of his fir&s;t coming down, u&s;ed him with much kindne&s;s. He had not then commanded long, when the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> came into tho&s;e Parts; whereupon he was compelled to ri&s;e; and after joyn'd with the King.</P>
<P>WHEN the Earl of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI>'s Forces were di&s;&s;olv'd, he was again de|&s;ign'd <MILESTONE N="10"> for that Service; and before the King left the Country, he grant|ed him the Seque&s;tration of all the E&s;tate of the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI> in <HI>Devon-&s;hire,</HI> all the E&s;tate of S^r <HI>Francis Drake</HI> (by which he had <HI>Buck|land Monachorum,</HI> which was his Quarter whil&s;t he blocked up <HI>Ply|mouth;</HI> and <HI>Worrington</HI> by <HI>Launceston)</HI> in <HI>Devon,</HI> and the Lord <HI>Roberts</HI> his E&s;tate in <HI>Cornwal;</HI> all which, and his Wife's E&s;tate, he enjoy'd by the Seque&s;tration granted from his Maje&s;ty, and of which he made a greater Revenue than ever the owners did in time of Peace. For, be|&s;ides that he &s;uffered no part of the&s;e E&s;tates to pay Contribution (where|by the Tenants very willingly paid their full Rents) he kept very much <MILESTONE N="20"> ground, about all the Hou&s;es, in his own hands; which he &s;tocked with &s;uch Cattle as he took from Delinquents: for though he &s;uffered not his Soldiers to plunder, yet he was, in truth, him&s;elf the greate&s;t plun|derer of this War; for whenever any Per&s;on had di&s;obeyed, or neglect|ed any of his Warrants, or when any Man fail'd to appear at the <HI>Po&s;&s;e</HI> (which he &s;ummoned very frequently after he was Sheriff of <HI>Devon,</HI> and for no other end but the penalty of Defaulters) he &s;ent pre&s;ently a Party of Hor&s;e to apprehend their Per&s;ons, and to drive their Grounds. If the Per&s;ons were taken, they were very well content to remit their Stock to redeem their Per&s;ons. For the better di&s;po&s;ing them thereto, <MILESTONE N="30"> he would now and then hang a Con&s;table, or &s;ome other poor fellow, for tho&s;e faults of which a hundred were as guilty: and if, out of the terror of this kind of Ju&s;tice, Men hid them&s;elves from being appre|hended, they dur&s;t not &s;end to require their Stock; which was from thence quietly enjoy'd: &s;o that he had a greater Stock of Cattle, of all &s;orts, upon his Grounds, than any Per&s;on what&s;oever in the We&s;t of <HI>England.</HI> Be&s;ides this, the ordering of Delinquents E&s;tates in tho&s;e Parts being before that time not well looked to, by virtue of the&s;e Seque&s;tra|tions, he &s;ei&s;ed upon all the Stock upon the Grounds, upon all the Fur|niture in the &s;everal Hou&s;es, and compelled the Tenants to pay to him <MILESTONE N="40"> all the Rents due from the beginning of the Rebellion. By the&s;e, and &s;uch like means, he had not only a va&s;t Stock, but receiv'd great &s;ums of Money, and had as great &s;tore of good Hou&s;ehold-Stuff, as would Fur|ni&s;h well tho&s;e Hou&s;es he looked upon as his own. This was his own E&s;tate, upon which, he &s;aid, he had maintained him&s;elf, without any allowance from the King; which, I am confident, be&s;ides what he got by his Contributions, which would allways pay double the Men he had, and were &s;trictly levied, and by his other arts, and extortions of &s;everal kinds, was more, and more worth in Money to him, than his Maje&s;ty be&s;towed upon all his General Commanders of Armies, and upon all his <MILESTONE N="50"> Officers of State, &s;ince the beginning of the Rebellion to that time. This computation would &s;eem too enviou&s;ly made, if I &s;hould proceed here to take any view of the Services he ever did; and therefore (though
<PB N="521" REF="5920">
they that are very good Witne&s;&s;es, &s;ay, that notwith&s;tanding all the bold promi&s;es of taking <HI>Plymouth</HI> within few days, <Q>&startq;his farthe&s;t Guards were never nearer the Town, than the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI>'s head Quarter was the&endq; fir&s;t day that he came thither)</Q> I &s;hall leave that to other Men to make the particular E&s;timate.</P>
<P>NOW when S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> de&s;ir'd at <HI>Barnstable</HI> a Protection for his Hou&s;es and E&s;tates, it was conceived, that he apprehended there might, under pretence of Claim, &s;ome attempt be made upon his Stock by the Owners; or that he feared, that there might be too &s;trict an en|quiry, by him that &s;ucceeded, for &s;uch things as being de&s;ign'd for the <MILESTONE N="10"> Publick Service, had been applied to his particular private U&s;e; as having, with great importunity (as a thing upon which the Service de|pended) gotten from the Commi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Devon</HI> above a thou&s;and Deal-boards, to make huts for the Soldiers, he employed them all in the building a great riding Hou&s;e at <HI>Buckland,</HI> for his own Plea&s;ure. However, &s;o &s;evere and terrible a Per&s;on might ea&s;ily be thought lyable to many tre&s;pa&s;&s;es, when he &s;hould be remov'd from the place where he Govern'd &s;o ab&s;olutely. The Protection was no &s;ooner asked by him, than promi&s;ed by the Prince; but, after his departure, his Ser|vant bringing &s;uch a Protection drawn, as exempted all tho&s;e E&s;tates <MILESTONE N="20"> which the King had Granted to him in Seque&s;tration, from the payment of any Contributions (the which had been already &s;o &s;candalous, that mo&s;t of the principal Per&s;ons of <HI>Cornwal</HI> had by that example, and with indignation at it, for born to pay their Rates; and he was told the ill con&s;equence of it; <Q>and, &startq;that no Per&s;on there in Council, whereof &s;ome had had very much greater Commands in Armies than He, and though others thought their Services de&s;erved any rea&s;onable Privi|ledge,&endq; had been ever freed from Contribution) thereupon tho&s;e clau&s;es were &s;truck out,</Q> and the Protection, in a fuller manner &s;till than ordina|ry, &s;ign'd by the Prince; and S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> then pre&s;ent, declared (of <MILESTONE N="30"> which his Servant was adverti&s;ed, though it was not fit, for the Example, to put it in writing) <Q>&startq;that he would not require any Contribution for that E&s;tate which was his Wife's, and enjoy'd by him only by virtue&endq; of the Seque&s;tration;</Q> and the denying of this Protection was his great grievance. And yet he did not only never pay a penny Contribution before, or after, for all the&s;e E&s;tates, but refus'd to pay the Fee-farm Rent, due to the King out of the Earl of <HI>Bedford</HI>'s E&s;tate, being two hundred Marks <HI>per annum,</HI> though the Auditor was &s;ent to him to de|mand it; but this was meerly an Act of his own Soveraignty.</P>
<P>AFTER this Angry Letter to the Lords, and the throwing up his <MILESTONE N="40"> Commi&s;&s;ion without a Letter, and &s;o having no Commi&s;&s;ion at all to meddle in Martial Affairs, he fixed a Quarter, with his own Hor&s;e and Foot, at S^t <HI>Mary Ottree,</HI> within nine or ten Miles of <HI>Exeter;</HI> where he govern'd as imperiou&s;ly as ever; rai&s;ed what Money he would, and impri&s;on'd what Per&s;ons he plea&s;ed. In the end, S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI> having appointed the Con&s;tables of tho&s;e hundreds which were a&s;&s;igned for <HI>Ply|mouth,</HI> to bring in their Accounts of what Money they had paid to S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> (which, he prote&s;ted, he did only that thereby he might &s;tate the Arrears, without the lea&s;t thought of reproach to the other) he caus'd a Warrant to be read in all Churches in the County <MILESTONE N="50"> (that is, ordered it to be read in all, and in &s;ome it was read) <Q>&startq;that all Per&s;ons &s;hould bring him an Account of what Monies, or Goods had&endq; been plundered from them by S^r <HI>John Berkley,</HI></Q> or any under him; with
<PB N="522" REF="5930">
&s;everal Clau&s;es very derogatory to his reputation. This, as it could not otherwi&s;e, begot great re&s;entments; in&s;omuch as the Commi&s;&s;io|ners of <HI>Devon</HI> &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the Prince, who was then in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> be&s;eeching him <Q>&startq;to call S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> from thence, and to take &s;ome Order for the &s;uppre&s;&s;ing the Furious inclinations of both &s;ides, or el&s;e they apprehended, the Enemy would quickly take an advan|tage of tho&s;e Di&s;&s;entions, and invade the Country before they other|wi&s;e&endq; intended;</Q> and, in their Letter, &s;ent one of the Warrants that S^r <HI>Richard</HI> had cau&s;ed to be read in the Churches; which indeed was the &s;trange&s;t I ever &s;aw. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>HEREUPON, the Prince &s;ent for S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> to attend him; who accordingly came to him at <HI>Liskard;</HI> <Q>where his Highne&s;s told him &startq;the &s;en&s;e he had of his di&s;re&s;pect towards him, in the &s;ending back his&endq; Commi&s;&s;ion in that manner;</Q> and of his carriage after; <Q>and asked him, &startq;what Authority he now had either to Command Men, or to&endq; publi&s;h &s;uch Warrants?</Q> <Q>He an&s;wer'd, &startq;that he was High Sheriff of <HI>Devon,</HI> and by virtue of that Office he might &s;uppre&s;s any Force, or enquire into any grievance his County &s;uffer'd; and, as far as in Him&endq; lay, give them remedy.</Q> <Q>He was told, &startq;as Sheriff he had no power to rai&s;e or head Men, otherwi&s;e than by the <HI>Po&s;&s;e Comitatus;</HI> which he <MILESTONE N="20"> could not neither upon his own head rai&s;e, without Warrant from the Ju&s;tices of Peace: that, in times of War, he was to receive Orders, upon occa&s;ions, from the Commander in Chief of the King's Forces;&endq; who had Authority to Command him by his Commi&s;&s;ion.</Q> <Q>He was asked, &startq;what he him&s;elf would have done, if when he Commanded be|fore <HI>Plymouth,</HI> the High Sheriff of <HI>Cornwal</HI> &s;hould have cau&s;ed &s;uch&endq; a Warrant concerning Him, to be read in Churches?</Q> He an&s;wered lit|tle to the Que&s;tions, but &s;ullenly extolled his Services, and enlarged his Sufferings. Afterwards, being reprehended with more Sharpne&s;s than ever before, and being told, <Q>&startq;that, whatever di&s;cour&s;es he made of <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;pending his E&s;tate, it was well under&s;tood, that he had no E&s;tate by any other Title than the meer bounty of the King; that he had been courted by the Prince more than he had rea&s;on to expect; and that he had not made tho&s;e returns on His part which became him; In &s;hort, if he had inclination to &s;erve his Highne&s;s, he &s;hould do it in that manner he &s;hould be directed; if Not, he &s;hould not, under the&endq; Title of being Sheriff, &s;atisfy his own Pride, and Pa&s;&s;ion</Q> (Upon which reprehen&s;ion being become much gentler, than upon all the gracious Addre&s;&s;es which had been made to him) he an&s;wered, <Q>&startq;he would &s;erve&endq; the Prince in &s;uch manner, as he &s;hould command;</Q> and thereupon <MILESTONE N="40"> he was di&s;charged, and return'd to his Hou&s;e to <HI>Worrington,</HI> one of tho&s;e places he had by Seque&s;tration (It belonged to S^r <HI>Francis Drake)</HI> where he liv'd privately, for the &s;pace of a fortnight, or thereabouts, without interpo&s;ing in the Publick bu&s;ine&s;s. Let us now &s;ee how this Tragedy was acted in other places.</P>
<P>WE left the King at <HI>Hereford,</HI> not re&s;olv'd what cour&s;e to &s;teer; Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> gone to <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> from whence he had made a &s;hort vi&s;it to the Prince at <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> to give him an account of the ill po&s;ture he had left the King in, and from thence went to <HI>Goring</HI> to con&s;ult with Him: and it was exceedingly wondered at, that when he &s;aw in what <MILESTONE N="50"> condition he was (for he was then before <HI>Taunton)</HI> and the Number of his Hor&s;e and Foot (which every body then thought had been his bu&s;ine&s;s to be inform'd of) he did not then ha&s;ten advice to the King, for
<PB N="523" REF="5940">
his &s;peedy repair thither; but his chief care was to &s;ecure <HI>Bristol;</HI> which, &s;ure, at that time he made not the lea&s;t que&s;tion of doing; and believ'd the Winter would come &s;ea&s;onably for future Coun&s;els.</P>
<P>THE King quickly left <HI>Hereford,</HI> and went to meet the Commi&s;|&s;ioners <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes to</HI> Abergave|ny <HI>to meet the Commi&s;&s;ioners of South</HI> Wales.</NOTE> for South <HI>Wales</HI> at <HI>Abergaveny,</HI> the Chief Town in <HI>Monmouth|&s;hire.</HI> As they were for the mo&s;t part Per&s;ons of the be&s;t Quality, and the large&s;t Fortunes of tho&s;e Counties, &s;o they had manife&s;ted great Loy|alty and Affection, from the beginning of the War, by &s;ending many good Regiments to the Army, and with their Sons, and Brothers, and neare&s;t Kindred; many of whom had lo&s;t their lives Bravely in the Feild: <MILESTONE N="10"> They now made as large and ample Profe&s;&s;ions as ever, and &s;eem'd to believe, that they &s;hould be able, in a very &s;hort time, to rai&s;e a good Army of Foot, with which the King might again look upon the Enemy; and accordingly agreed what Numbers &s;hould be levied upon each of the Counties. From thence his Maje&s;ty went to <HI>Ragland</HI>-Ca&s;tle, the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Ragland<HI>-Ca&s;tle:</HI></NOTE> Noble Hou&s;e of the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Worcester;</HI> which was well Fortify'd, and Garri&s;on'd by him; who remain'd then in it. There he re&s;olv'd to &s;tay, till he &s;hould &s;ee the effect of the Commi&s;&s;ioners mighty promi|&s;es. But he found in a &s;hort time, that, either by the continued &s;ucce&s;|&s;es of the Parliament Armies in all places, the particular information <MILESTONE N="20"> whereof was every day brought to them, by Intelligence from their Friends, or the Triumphs of their Enemies in <HI>Monmouth</HI> and <HI>Glouce&s;ter,</HI> or by the renewed troubles, which the pre&s;ence of their Governour, Ge|neral <HI>Gerrard,</HI> gave them (who had been, and continued to be, a pa&s;|&s;ionate, and unskilful manager of the Affections of the People; as hav|ing govern'd them with extraordinary rigour, and with as little cour|te&s;ie and civility towards the Gentry, as towards the Common People) there was little probability of rai&s;ing an Army in tho&s;e parts: where all Men grew le&s;s affected, or more firghted, which produced one and the &s;ame effect. <Q>The King &s;tay'd at <HI>Ragland,</HI> till the News came &startq;that <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>Fairfax,</HI> after he had taken <HI>Leicester</HI> (which could not hold out longer&endq; than to make honourable conditions)</Q> <Q>&startq;was marched into the We&s;t, and had defeated <HI>Goring</HI>'s Troops at <HI>Lamport;</HI> and at the &s;ame time, that the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army was upon its march towards <HI>Worcester,</HI> having taken a little Garri&s;on that lay between <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> by&endq; Sorm; and put all within it to the Sword.</Q> And Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> &s;ent for all tho&s;e Foot which were levied towards a new Army, and part of tho&s;e which belonged to General <HI>Gerrard,</HI> to &s;upply the Garri&s;on of <HI>Bristol:</HI> &s;o that his Maje&s;ty &s;eemed now to have nothing in his Choice, but to tran&s;port him&s;elf over the <HI>Severn</HI> to <HI>Bristol,</HI> and thence to have <MILESTONE N="40"> repair'd to his Army in the We&s;t; which would have been much bet|ter done Before, yet had been well done Then; and the King re&s;olv'd to do &s;o; and that the Hor&s;e under <HI>Gerrard,</HI> and <HI>Langdale,</HI> &s;hould find a tran&s;portation over <HI>Severn</HI> (which might have been done) and then find the way to him, wherever he &s;hould be.</P>
<P>THIS was &s;o fully re&s;olv'd, that his Maje&s;ty went to the Water &s;ide near <HI>Chep&s;tow;</HI> where Ve&s;&s;els were ready to tran&s;port him, and where <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Chep&s;tow&punc;</NOTE> Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> from <HI>Bri&s;tol</HI> met him, very well plea&s;ed with the Re&s;o|lution he had taken, though he had not been Privy to the coun&s;el. Here again the unhappy di&s;cord in the Court, rai&s;ed new ob&s;tructions; they <MILESTONE N="50"> who did not love Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> nor were lov'd by him, could not en|dure to think that the King &s;hould be &s;o wholely within his power; and he him&s;elf was far from being importunate that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould pro|&s;ecute
<PB N="524" REF="5950">
his purpo&s;e, which he had not advi&s;ed, though he liked it well enough; and &s;o would not be an&s;werable for any &s;ucce&s;s. His Maje&s;ty him&s;elf being too irre&s;olute, the coun&s;el was again changed, and the King marched to <HI>Cardiff;</HI> where he had been very little time, when he <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Cardiff.</NOTE> was inform'd, that <HI>Bridgewater</HI> was lo&s;t: and then they, who had di&s;|&s;waded the King's embarkation for <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> were much exalted, and thought them&s;elves good Coun&s;ellors; though, in truth, the former re&s;olution had been even Then much better pur&s;ued; for nothing could have hinder'd his Maje&s;ty from going to <HI>Exeter,</HI> and joyning all his Forces; which would have put him in a po&s;ture much better than he <MILESTONE N="10"> was ever afterwards. Indeed the taking <HI>Bridgewater,</HI> which the King <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>S^r</HI> T. Fairfax <HI>takes</HI> Bridge|water.</NOTE> had been per&s;waded to believe a place impregnable, could not but make great impre&s;&s;ions upon him, to think that he was betrayed, and con|&s;equently not to know whom to tru&s;t. It was in truth matter of amaze|ment to all Men, nor was it any excu&s;e, that it was not of &s;trength enough again&s;t &s;o &s;trong an Army; for it was &s;o &s;trongly &s;ituated, and it might well have had all tho&s;e Additions which were nece&s;&s;ary, by For|tifications, that it was inexcu&s;able in a Governour <Q>(who had enjoyed that Charge above three years, with all allowances he had him&s;elf de|&s;ired, and had often a&s;&s;ured the King, &startq;&endq;that it was not to be taken)</Q> <MILESTONE N="20"> that it did not re&s;i&s;t any the greate&s;t &s;trength that could come before it for one Week; and within le&s;s than that time, it was &s;urrender'd, and put into <HI>Fairfax</HI>'s hands.</P>
<P>THAT this prodigious &s;ucce&s;s on the Enemies &s;ide, &s;hould break the Spirits of mo&s;t Men, and even ca&s;t them into de&s;pair, is not at all to be wonder'd at; but that it &s;hould rai&s;e the hopes of any that it would produce a Peace, is very &s;trange; yet this imagination did &s;o much harm, that Men generally neglected to make that preparation again&s;t a power|ful and in&s;ulting Enemy, that was in their power to have made, out of confidence that the offer of a Treaty would now prevail, and pro|duce <MILESTONE N="30"> a Peace; and every Man abounded &s;o much in his own &s;en&s;e on this point, that they were not capable of any rea&s;on that contradicted it. The Commi&s;&s;ioners of all Counties, which were the be&s;t Gentlemen, and of be&s;t Affections, upon whom the King depended to apply the Common People to his Service, were &s;o fully of this opinion, that they made Cabals with the principal Officers of the Army, to concur with them in this judgement, and to contrive &s;ome way how it might be brought to pa&s;s; and too many of them were weary of doing their duty, or &s;o much a&s;hamed of not having done it, that they profe&s;&s;ed them|&s;elves to de&s;ire it, at lea&s;t as much as the re&s;t. This temper &s;pread it <MILESTONE N="40"> &s;elf &s;o univer&s;ally, that it reached to Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> Him&s;elf; who writ his Advice to that purpo&s;e to the Duke of <HI>Richmond,</HI> to be pre&s;ented to the King; who took that occa&s;ion, to write the en&s;uing Letter to the Prince, with his own hand; which was &s;o lively an expre&s;&s;ion of his own Soul, that no Pen el&s;e could have written it, and de&s;erves to be tran&s;mitted to Po&s;terity, as a part of the Portraiture of that excellent Per&s;on, which hath been di&s;gui&s;ed by fal&s;e, or erroneous Copies from the true Original; and follows in the&s;e words.</P>

<P><Q>WHEN the King came to <HI>Cardiff,</HI> he was entertain'd with the News, &startq;that the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army was &s;et down before <HI>Hereford,</HI> and that, if it&endq; were not reliev'd within a Month, it mu&s;t fall into their hands.</Q> To provide for this, there could be no better way found out, than to di|rect <MILESTONE N="50"> the Sheriffs of tho&s;e <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> Counties to Summon their <HI>po&s;&s;e Comi|tatus,</HI> whereby the King was per&s;waded to hope, that there would be Men enough to wait upon him in that expedition; who with the Hor&s;e
<PB N="526" REF="5980">
he had, would have been equal to any attempt they could make upon the <HI>Scots.</HI> But it was quickly di&s;cover'd, that this Expedient had rai&s;ed an unruly Spirit, that could not ea&s;ily be &s;uppre&s;s'd again; for the di&s;|contented Gentlemen of tho&s;e Counties, now they had gotten the Peo|ple legally together, put them in mind of <Q>&startq;the Injuries they had re|ceiv'd from General <HI>Gerrard,</HI> and the intolerable exactions they lay under, which would undoubtedly be increa&s;ed, if he continued in that&endq; Government.</Q> So that, in&s;tead of providing Men to march with the King, they provided a long li&s;t of Grievances; from all which they de|&s;ired to be reliev'd before they would apply them&s;elves towards the re|lief <MILESTONE N="10"> of <HI>Hereford.</HI> All this was &s;o &s;turdily urged, that a Body of no le&s;s than four thou&s;and Men, of tho&s;e who were thus called together, con|tinued together many days, and would not be &s;eparated, till the King was even compell'd to give them &s;atisfaction in the particular they mo&s;t in&s;i&s;ted upon; which was the removal of General <HI>Gerrard</HI> from having any command over them; and that Charge was pre&s;ently conferr'd upon the Lord <HI>A&s;tley,</HI> the Major General of the Army; who was mo&s;t ac|ceptable to them; and they afterwards conform'd them&s;elves as much to his directions, as from the di&s;traction of the time, and the continual ill &s;ucce&s;&s;es, could be expected by him. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>BUT it was the hard fate of the King, that he could not provide what was fit for his own Service, except he provided likewi&s;e for the &s;ati&s;|faction of other Mens humours and appetites. <HI>Gerrard</HI> had now, upon the matter, the Command of all the Forces the King had to tru&s;t to in tho&s;e parts; and he was of too impetuous a nature, to &s;ubmit to any thing for Con&s;cience, or Di&s;cretion, or Duty; &s;o that the King was com|pell'd to &s;atisfy his ambition for this pre&s;ent degradation, by making him a Baron; and, which was an odd and a very fanta&s;tical circum&s;tance that attended it, for no other rea&s;on, than becau&s;e there was once an Eminent Per&s;on, called <HI>Charles Brandon,</HI> who was afterwards made a <MILESTONE N="30"> Duke, he would be Created Baron of <HI>Brandon,</HI> that there might be an|other <HI>Charles Brandon,</HI> who had no le&s;s a&s;piring thoughts than the former; when he had no pretence to the Lands of <HI>Brandon;</HI> which be|longed to, and were, at that time, in the po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of a gallant and wor|thy Gentleman, S^r <HI>Thomas Glemham;</HI> who at the &s;ame time (very un|luckily upon that account) came to the King at <HI>Cardiff,</HI> with about two hundred Foot, which he had brought with him out of the Garri&s;on of <HI>Carli&s;le;</HI> which place he had defended for the &s;pace of eleven Months again&s;t <HI>David Le&s;ley,</HI> and till all the Hor&s;es of the Garri&s;on were eaten, and then had render'd, upon as honourable conditions, as had been given <MILESTONE N="40"> upon any Surrender; <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> him&s;elf conveyed him to <HI>Hereford;</HI> where he joyn'd with the other part of that Army, and from thence S^r <HI>Thomas Glemham</HI> (who was by his conditions to march to the King wherever he was) came to his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Cardiff,</HI> at the time when the Title of his own Land, which came to him by inheritance, was con|ferr'd upon a Gentleman of another Family; who, how well extracted &s;oever, was of le&s;s Fortune, and, as many thought, of no greater Qua|lity, or Merit. This un&s;ea&s;onable preferment more irritated the Coun|try, from which the King then expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance, that when they be|liev'd they had accu&s;ed him of crimes which de&s;erv'd the highe&s;t cen&s;ure, <MILESTONE N="50"> they &s;aw him pretend to, and rewarded in, an higher degree than he could ever probably have arrived to, but for that Accu&s;ation. Here the King, after all his endeavours were render'd fruitle&s;s, entertain'd a new
<PB N="527" REF="5990">
imagination, that he might get into <HI>Scotland</HI> to the Marquis of <HI>Moun|tro&s;e,</HI> who had done wonders there; and thereupon left <HI>Cardiff;</HI> and, over the Mountains of <HI>Brecknock,</HI> and <HI>Radnor,</HI> pa&s;&s;ed the <HI>Scotch</HI> Quar|ters, and came to <HI>Ludlow,</HI> before that Army had any Notice of his march.</P>
<P>WHEN the King came fir&s;t to <HI>Ragland,</HI> he had &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the Prince, by which he wi&s;hed <Q>&startq;that the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, might, a&s;&s;oon as was po&s;&s;ible, attend his&endq; Maje&s;ty.</Q> The danger of the way was &s;uch, and the pa&s;&s;age &s;o difficult, that the Me&s;&s;enger came not quickly to his Highne&s;s. The Chancellor <MILESTONE N="10"> being then unfit to travel by rea&s;on of the Gout, the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> made all po&s;&s;ible ha&s;t out of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> where the Prince then was, and found his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Cardiff,</HI> when he was departing from thence; and waited on him to <HI>Brecknock;</HI> from whence he was again di&s;patched with this Letter to the Prince; which, being the fir&s;t direction the King gave of that Nature, is nece&s;&s;ary to be here in&s;erted in &s;o many words.</P>

<P>THIS Letter being pre&s;ented to his Highne&s;s, then at <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Which the Prince grant|ed.</NOTE> found &s;o gracious a reception, that the next day, being the &s;econd of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> the Prince return'd him an an&s;wer of full con&s;ent; and the &s;ame day Sign'd all the particulars propo&s;ed by him; <Q>expre&s;&s;ing a further re|&s;olution &startq;to add whatever el&s;e &s;hould be propos'd to him, and within&endq; his Power to grant;</Q> &s;o that there was once more a hope of looking the <MILESTONE N="10"> Enemy in the face, and having a fair day for the We&s;t. The next day, or thereabouts, S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> him&s;elf attended the Prince, in a &s;eeming good humour; all the Propo&s;itions were immediately confirm'd; <Q>&s;ome of which were, &startq;that S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> &s;hould receive &s;uch a proportion of the Contributions of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and five thou&s;and pounds of the Arrears, for the payment of the Officers of the Army; and thereupon S^r <HI>Richard</HI> would gather up all the &s;traglers, who were re|turned into <HI>Cornwal</HI> from their Colours; who, he &s;aid, would amount to three thou&s;and Foot; and he would rai&s;e three thou&s;and Foot more&endq; in <HI>Devon-&s;hire.</HI></Q> So he betook him&s;elf again to Action, &s;ending out <MILESTONE N="20"> his Warrants, and levying Men and Money; having lent two hundred pounds to the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> at their fir&s;t meeting, and calling the <HI>Po&s;&s;e</HI> of <HI>Devon</HI> to meet at &s;everal places, where him&s;elf was &s;till pre&s;ent; by which, he pretended, he &s;hould &s;peedily recruit the Army. But before the end of <HI>August,</HI> that Friend&s;hip grew colder; S^r <HI>Richard</HI> ob&s;erving a better corre&s;pondence between the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> and S^r <HI>John Berkely,</HI> than he hoped would have been, and hearing that the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> u&s;ed to mention him very &s;lightly (which was true) he writ a very &s;harp Letter to him, in which he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he would have no more to do with&endq; him.</Q> However he continued as Active as before, being now in <HI>Devon,</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> and then in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> where he Commanded ab&s;olutely without any Commi&s;&s;ion, and very &s;ea&s;onably Suppre&s;&s;ed an In&s;urrection about S^$ <HI>Ives,</HI> which might el&s;e have grown to a head; and hanged two or three fellows, who, I believe, were guilty enough, by his own order without any Council of War; and rai&s;ed what Money he plea&s;ed upon others; then return'd to his Hou&s;e at <HI>Worrington.</HI> All the Vivacity that had &s;o lately appear'd in the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> upon the news of the lo&s;s of <HI>Sher|borne,</HI> declin'd; and then there was nothing, but complaint of want of Money, and a Propo&s;ition to put the Army into Garri&s;ons; although the Enemy gave them the &s;ame lei&s;ure, to pur&s;ue the former de&s;ign, <MILESTONE N="40"> <HI>Fairfax</HI> being then engaged with his Army before <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>ASSOON as the Prince, who was then at <HI>Launceston,</HI> had read the Letter, which the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> brought to him from the King, he return'd it to the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> to keep, and to communicate it to the Lords <HI>Capel, Hopton,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer; for it was a misfortune, that there was not &s;o good Corre&s;pondence with the Earl of <HI>Berk-&s;hire</HI> (through &s;ome jealou&s;ies that were infu&s;ed into him) as might have been wi&s;hed; and from the Prince's fir&s;t coming into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> &s;ome of his Servants of the be&s;t Quality, who had from the be|ginning been di&s;contented, and upon &s;trange pretences thought them|&s;elves <MILESTONE N="50"> undervalued that they were not of the Council, and, &s;ince the King's misfortune at <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> expre&s;&s;ed their indi&s;po&s;itions with more Licence, <Q>and whi&s;pered abroad &startq;that there was a purpo&s;e of carrying&endq;
<PB N="529" REF="6010">
the Prince into <HI>France,</HI></Q> not that they believed it, but thereby thought to render the Council odious, and &s;u&s;pected, had wrought &s;o far upon the Earl of <HI>Berk-&s;hire,</HI> that He &s;eem'd to believe it too, whereby they got &s;o much intere&s;t in him, that he allways communicated what&s;o|ever pa&s;&s;ed in Council to them; &s;o that a Letter of &s;o great importance was not thought fit to be communicated to him, nor to the Earl of <HI>Brentford,</HI> who (though he was very kind, and ju&s;t to the other four) was not without his jealou&s;ies, and was an ill trea&s;urer of Secrets. They were very much troubled at the &s;ight of the Letter, not at the com|mand of leaving the Kingdom, for, though they had never communi|cated <MILESTONE N="10"> their thoughts to each other upon that &s;ubject before, they found them&s;elves unanimous in the re&s;olution, <Q>&startq;that rather than he &s;hould be taken by the Rebels, they would carry him into any part of the Chri&s;tian&endq; World.</Q> For the better doing whereof, from that Minute, they took care that there was allways a Ship ready in the Harbour of <HI>Falmouth.</HI> <Q>But it troubled them, &startq;that the King's Command was &s;o po&s;itive for <HI>France,</HI> again&s;t which they could make to them&s;elves many Obje|ctions.&endq;</Q> Be&s;ides that, one of the Prince's Bedchamber, who was new|ly return'd from Paris, brought a Letter from the Earl of <HI>Norwich,</HI> then the Kings Emba&s;&s;adour there, to one of the Council; in which <MILESTONE N="20"> taking notice of a report there of the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI>'s coming thither, <Q>he pa&s;&s;ionately declared again&s;t it, &startq;&endq; as a certain Ruin to the Prince;</Q> of which the Me&s;&s;enger, by His direction, gave many in&s;tances of mo|ment. <Q>And they were the more troubled, becau&s;e the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> who brought that Letter from the King, averred, &startq;that he had had no conference with the King upon the Argument, but had wholely de|clin'd&endq; it, as a matter too great for him: &s;o that they had nothing be|fore them but that Letter.</Q> <Q>After two or three Sad debates between them&s;elves, they agreed upon &startq;a Letter to be prepared in Cipher, pre|&s;enting their rea&s;ons, and what they had been informed concerning <MILESTONE N="30"> <HI>France;</HI> and therefore offered it to his Maje&s;ty, whether he would not leave the choice of the place to Them, or nominate &s;ome other, again&s;t which &s;o many exceptions might not be made; and propo&s;ed <HI>Ireland</HI> (if the Peace were made there) or <HI>Scotland,</HI> if the Marqui&s;s of <HI>Moun|tro&s;e</HI> was as victorious as he was reported to be; withal a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty, that, in ca&s;e of danger, they would run any hazard, or into any Country, before the Prince &s;hould fall into the hands of the Re|bels.&endq;</Q> This Letter after it was communicated with the Prince, as the debates had been, was forthwith &s;ent by an Expre&s;s.</P>
<P>TOWARDS the end of <HI>August,</HI> the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> after he had, in all <MILESTONE N="40"> his &s;ecret di&s;cour&s;es, and in the hours of his jollity, &s;poken very bitterly of the Council about the Prince, as the Authors of all the Mi&s;carriages, &s;ent the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> to <HI>Launceston</HI> to his Highne&s;s, with certain demands, as he call'd them, on his behalf; <Q>but with direction, &startq;that before he pre&s;ented them to the Prince, he &s;hould communicate them to the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> or to the Chancellor, and be advi&s;ed by them,&endq; in what manner to pre&s;ent them.</Q></P>
<P>HIS Demands were, and &s;o he &s;tyled them (1) To have a Commi&s;|&s;ion to be Lieutenant-General of all the We&s;t, and to Command im|mediately under the Prince, Garri&s;ons as well as the Army, and to be <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;worn of the Council a&s;&s;oon as might be.

Of this di&s;cour&s;e General <HI>Goring</HI> had made great u&s;e, to the di&s;advantage of all tho&s;e whom he de&s;ired to di&s;credit, which was indeed one of the Motives of his Highne&s;s's Journey to <HI>Exeter,</HI> that he might di&s;countenance that Report; which had wrought &s;o far among&s;t the Gentlemen of the &s;everal We&s;tern Counties, who were re|tired thither for &s;afety, <Q>that there was a Re&s;olution among them &startq;to Petition the Prince to interpo&s;e between the King, and the Parliament;&endq; and to &s;end a Me&s;&s;age to the latter with Overtures of Peace: and to that purpo&s;e, meetings had been among&s;t tho&s;e Gentlemen, to agree upon what Articles the Prince &s;hould propo&s;e a Peace;</Q> every Man de|claring <MILESTONE N="30"> his opinion, what conde&s;cen&s;ion &s;hould be in the matter of the Church, of the Militia, and of <HI>Ireland,</HI> upon con&s;ideration of what had pa&s;&s;ed at <HI>Uxbridge.</HI> When my Lords of the Council heard of the&s;e con|&s;ultations, they apprehended great inconveniences might ari&s;e from thence to the King's Service, and to the Prince; who, by being pre&s;&s;ed by their de&s;ires, and importunities, would lo&s;e the honour and thanks of the good Succe&s;s that might attend it: Be&s;ides that, if he &s;hould &s;end any Me&s;&s;age upon their motion, they would quickly make Them&s;elves judges of the matter of it, and Coun&s;ellors of what was to be done upon it: therefore they were of opinion, <Q>&startq;that all endeavours were to be <MILESTONE N="40"> u&s;ed to divert, and prevent any Petition of &s;uch a nature from being&endq; pre&s;ented to his Highne&s;s;</Q> which, with great difficulty, was at la&s;t effected.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after the Prince's coming to <HI>Exeter,</HI> the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> be|ing <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Conference between the Lord</HI> Goring <HI>and one of the Prince's Coun|cil.</HI></NOTE> not then well, but engaged in a cour&s;e of Phy&s;ick, de&s;ired that he might have a free conference with one of the Council in private; in which, he profe&s;&s;ed he would di&s;cover his heart, and whatever had &s;tuck with him. Whereupon, according to appointment, the Per&s;on he had de&s;ired, went to him one Morning to his Lodging; when he cau&s;ed all Per&s;ons to withdraw; and bid his Servant not to &s;uffer any Man to <MILESTONE N="50"> di&s;turb them. <Q>When they were by them&s;elves, he began with the di&s;|cour&s;e of &startq;unkindne&s;&s;es he had apprehended from the Council, and from&endq; that Per&s;on in particular;</Q> but confe&s;&s;ed he had been deceiv'd, and
<Q><PB N="532" REF="6040">
&startq;abu&s;ed by wrong information: that he was now very &s;en&s;ible of the damage that had befallen the Publick by tho&s;e private Jealou&s;ies and Mi&s;takes; and de&s;ired, that if any thing had indi&s;creetly or pa&s;&s;ionate|ly fallen from him, it might be forgotten; and that they might all proceed vigorou&s;ly in what concern'd the King's Service; in which he could not receive a better encouragement, than by an a&s;&s;urance of&endq; that Per&s;on's Friend&s;hip.</Q> <Q>From this, he di&s;cour&s;ed at large &startq;his ap|prehen&s;ions of his Brother <HI>Porter,</HI> of his Cowardice, and of his Trea|chery,&endq; with very great freedom in many particular in&s;tances;</Q> and concluded, <Q>&startq;&endq; that he re&s;olv'd to quit him&s;elf of him;</Q> and after two hours <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;pent in tho&s;e di&s;cour&s;es, and in &s;omewhat that concern'd his Father, in which he &s;aid, <Q>&startq;he was to receive this Per&s;on's advice by his Fathers&endq; direction</Q> (it being about the Government of <HI>Pendennis)</HI> as if he had &s;aid all he meant to &s;ay, he asked the other negligently, <Q>&startq;what he thought&endq; of the Demands he had &s;ent by the Lord <HI>Wentworth?</HI> prote&s;ting,</Q> <Q>&startq;he had no Private thoughts, but only an eye to the Publick Service; towards the doing whereof, as the exigents of affairs then &s;tood, he&endq; did not think him&s;elf &s;ufficiently qualified.</Q> <Q>The other told him, &startq;that whatever He thought of them would not &s;ignify much, being but a &s;ingle voice in Council; by the concurrent advice whereof, he pre|&s;umed, <MILESTONE N="20"> the Prince would govern him&s;elf. However, if he would have him tell him his opinion as a Friend, he would &s;hew him&s;elf &s;o ill a Courtier, as to tell it him frankly; which, except he reform'd him in his judgement, he &s;hould declare where it &s;hould be propo&s;ed, and, he believ'd, it would be the opinion of mo&s;t of the Lords, if it were&endq; not His.</Q> <Q>Thereupon he told him very freely and plainly, &startq;that he thought his demands not fit for the Prince to grant, nor &s;ea&s;onable for Him to ask; his Authority being the &s;ame, as to the Publick, all his Orders being obeyed, and the Prince giving him the &s;ame a&s;&s;i&s;tance, as if he were his Lieutenant General: that the Prince had not hitherto <MILESTONE N="30"> interpo&s;ed his Authority in the governing that Army; and therefore, that he conceiv'd it un&s;ea&s;onable, at that time, for his Highne&s;s to in|tere&s;t him&s;elf in the command thereof; which he &s;hould do by making him Lieutenant General: that the King having directed the Prince to make the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> his Lieutenant General, it would not become Them to advi&s;e the Prince to alter that de&s;ignation, without receiving&endq; his Maje&s;ties Command:</Q> <Q>therefore he advi&s;ed him, &startq;&s;ince the altera|tion was no way nece&s;&s;ary, and would inevitably beget much trouble, that he would defer the pre&s;&s;ing it, till the King's Affairs &s;hould be in&endq; a better po&s;ture.</Q> Satisfied he was not, yet he forbore to importune <MILESTONE N="40"> the Prince to that purpo&s;e at this time.</P>
<P>ABOUT the middle of <HI>September,</HI> the Prince being &s;till at <HI>Exeter,</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Prince</HI> Ru|pert <HI>delivers up</HI> Bri&s;tol.</NOTE> the News came of the fatal lo&s;s of <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> which, as all ill accidents at that time did, ca&s;t all Men on their faces, and damped all the former Vigour and Activity for a march. However the former re&s;olution con|tinued of drawing to <HI>Tiverton,</HI> and at lea&s;t of defending tho&s;e Pa&s;&s;es, and keeping the Enemy from invading <HI>Devon:</HI> for the better doing whereof, and enabling them to Fight, if <HI>Fairfax</HI> &s;hould advance, the Prince return'd to <HI>Launce&s;ton;</HI> whither he Summon'd all the Train'd-bands of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and an appearance of the whole Country; which ap|pear'd <MILESTONE N="50"> very chearfully, and &s;eem'd well inclined to march to <HI>Tiverton.</HI> In the mean time the &s;ame negligence and di&s;order continued in the Army, and the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> with the &s;ame Licence and Unconcerned|ne&s;s,

remain'd at <HI>Exeter,</HI> to the great Scandal of the Country, and di&s;heartning of the Army. About the latter end of <HI>September,</HI> his Lord|&s;hip writ a Letter to the Lord <HI>Colepepper;</HI> in which he remember'd him of the Propo&s;itions formerly &s;ent by the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> to <HI>Laun|ce&s;ton;</HI> and recounted at large, but very unju&s;tly, the di&s;cour&s;e which had pa&s;&s;ed between the other Coun&s;ellor and Him, at <HI>Exeter,</HI> upon that Subject; in which he charged the other with An&s;wers very far from tho&s;e he had receiv'd from him; <Q>and de&s;ired his Lord&s;hip, &startq;that, by&endq; His means, he might know po&s;itively what he was to tru&s;t to;</Q> con|cluding, <Q>&startq;that without &s;uch a Commi&s;&s;ion as he de&s;ired, he could not&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> be an&s;werable for the mutinies and di&s;orders of the Army.</Q> Where|upon his Highne&s;s, upon full con&s;ideration of the mi&s;chiefs that would attend his Service, if he &s;hould con&s;ent to the Matter of tho&s;e demands, or comply with the Manner of the demanding, <Q>&s;ent him word, &startq;that&endq; he would not, for the pre&s;ent, grant any &s;uch Commi&s;&s;ion;</Q> and wi&s;hed him <Q>&startq;to pur&s;ue the former Coun&s;els and Re&s;olutions, in advancing to|wards the Enemy; all things being in a good forwardne&s;s in <HI>Cornwal&endq;</HI> to &s;econd him. And &s;o there was no further pre&s;&s;ing that Overture;</Q> however, he pre&s;umed to &s;tyle him&s;elf, in all his Warrants, and Trea|ties with the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and in &s;ome Orders which he Printed, <MILESTONE N="20"> <Q>&startq;&endq;General of the We&s;t.</Q></P>
<P>THE &s;uddain and unexpected lo&s;s of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> was a new Earthquake in all the little Quarters the King had left, and no le&s;s broke all the Mea&s;ures which had been taken, and the de&s;igns which had been con|trived, than the lo&s;s of the Battle of <HI>Na&s;eby</HI> had done. The King had made ha&s;t from <HI>Ludlow,</HI> that the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army might no more be able to interrupt him; and with very little re&s;t pa&s;&s;ed through <HI>Shrop&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Derby&s;hire,</HI> till he came to <HI>Wellbeck,</HI> a Hou&s;e of the Marquis of <HI>New-Castle</HI> in <HI>Nottingham-&s;hire,</HI> then a Garri&s;on for his Maje&s;ty; where he refre&s;hed Him&s;elf, and his Troops, two days; and, as far as any re&s;o|lution <MILESTONE N="30"> was fixed in tho&s;e days, <Q>the purpo&s;e was, &startq;to march directly&endq; into <HI>Scotland,</HI> to joyn with the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e;</HI></Q> who had, upon the matter, reduced that whole Kingdom. During his Maje&s;ties &s;hort &s;tay at <HI>Wellbeck,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Newark,</HI> with the Commi&s;&s;ioners for <HI>Nottingham</HI> and <HI>Lincoln,</HI> repaired to him, as likewi&s;e all tho&s;e Gen|tlemen of <HI>York-&s;hire</HI> who had been in <HI>Pontefract-</HI>Ca&s;tle (which, after a long and worthy defence, was lately, for meer want of all kind of Pro|vi&s;ions, Surrender'd upon good conditions; <Q>whereby, &startq;all the Soldiers&endq; had liberty to repair to their own Hou&s;es, and might live quietly there)</Q> whereupon the Gentlemen a&s;&s;ured the King, <Q>&startq;they were as ready as&endq; <MILESTONE N="40"> ever to &s;erve him, when they &s;hould be required.</Q> Whether the wonted irre&s;olution of tho&s;e about the King, or the imagination, upon this re|port of the Gentlemen, that a body of Foot might be &s;peedily gather'd together in tho&s;e parts (which was enough encouraged by the chearful|ne&s;s of all the Gentlemen of the &s;everal Counties) prevailed, or not, &s;o it was, that the King was per&s;waded, <Q>&startq;that it was not be&s;t to continue his march, with that &s;peed he intended, towards <HI>Mountro&s;e;</HI> but that it would be better to &s;end an Expre&s;s to him, to agree upon a fit place for their meeting; and in the mean time, his Maje&s;ty might be able to refre&s;h his wearied Troops, and to rai&s;e a Body of Foot in tho&s;e&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> parts.</Q> To which purpo&s;e, <HI>Doncaster</HI> was propo&s;ed as a fit place to begin in: and to <HI>Doncaster,</HI> thereupon the King went; and the Gen|tlemen <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes to</HI> Donca&s;ter.</NOTE> &s;o well perform'd their undertaking, that, within three days,
<PB N="534" REF="6060">
there was an appearance of full three thou&s;and Foot; who undertook, within four and twenty hours, to appear well armed, and ready to march with his Maje&s;ty, what way &s;oever he would go.</P>
<P>HERE again the King's froward Fortune, deprived him of this op|portunity to put him&s;elf into a po&s;ture of War. <Q>That very night, they receiv'd Intelligence, &startq;that <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> was come to <HI>Rotheram</HI> with&endq; all the <HI>Scotch</HI> Hor&s;e; which was within ten miles of <HI>Doncaster.</HI></Q> The News whereof &s;o confounded them (as beaten and baffled Troops do not naturally, in a &s;hort time, recover courage enough to endure the &s;ight of an Enemy) that they concluded <Q>&startq;he came in pur&s;uit of the King, <MILESTONE N="10"> and therefore that it was now too late to proceed upon their Northern Expedition, and that the King mu&s;t &s;peedily remove to a greater di|&s;tance&endq; for his own &s;ecurity.</Q> Whereupon, he made ha&s;t (without ex|pecting that recruit of Foot) from <HI>Doncaster,</HI> back again to <HI>Newark;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Newark.</NOTE> Re&s;olving then to go directly to <HI>Oxford:</HI> whereas, in truth, <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> knew nothing of the King's being in tho&s;e parts; but, upon &s;ud|dain Orders from <HI>Scotland,</HI> was required to march, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, with the Hor&s;e, to relieve his own Country from being to|tally overrun and &s;ubdued by the Marquis of <HI>Mountro&s;e;</HI> who had then actually taken <HI>Edenborough.</HI> The Orders had no &s;ooner come to the <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Scotch</HI> Army before <HI>Hereford,</HI> but he begun his march, without the lea&s;t apprehen&s;ion of any Enemy in his way, till he &s;hould come into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and &s;o, as he had made a very long march that day, he came tired and wearied with his Troops that night into <HI>Rotheram.</HI> <Q>And he confe&s;&s;ed afterwards, &startq;if the King had then fallen upon him, as he might ea&s;ily have done, he had found him in a very ill po&s;ture to have&endq; made re&s;i&s;tance, and had ab&s;olutely pre&s;erv'd <HI>Mountro&s;e.</HI></Q> But by his &s;o &s;uddain retreat, <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> was at liberty to pur&s;ue his march for <HI>Scotland,</HI> and came upon <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> before he expected &s;uch an Ene|my; <NOTE PLACE="marg">Mountro&s;e <HI>defeated by</HI> David Le&s;ley</NOTE> and &s;o prevented his future triumph, that he was compell'd with <MILESTONE N="30"> great lo&s;s to retire again into the Highlands; and <HI>Le&s;ley</HI> return'd time enough to relieve and &s;upport the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, after they were com|pell'd to ri&s;e from <HI>Hereford.</HI></P>
<P>THE King now, with great expedition, pro&s;ecuted his Journey to <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King goes to</HI> Oxford:</NOTE> <HI>Oxford,</HI> though not without making &s;ome Starts out of the way; by which he had opportunity, to beat up &s;ome Quarters of new levied Hor&s;e for the Service of the Parliament; and, before the end of <HI>Augu&s;t,</HI> he arrived at <HI>Oxford;</HI> where he did not &s;tay more than two days, but de|parted from thence again to <HI>Worcester,</HI> with a re&s;olution to attempt the relief of <HI>Hereford;</HI> which had defended it &s;elf bravely, and very much <MILESTONE N="40"> weaken'd the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army by frequent Sallies. They had only a Body of eight hundred tired Hor&s;e remaining, which <HI>David Le&s;ley</HI> left be|hind him when he marched with the re&s;t into <HI>Scotland;</HI> and therefore the rai&s;ing that Siege was thought the le&s;s difficult; and with this re&s;o|lution his Maje&s;ty left <HI>Oxford</HI> the third day after he came thither. <Q>Upon <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Ragland.</NOTE> his arrival at <HI>Ragland,</HI> he was certainly inform'd, &startq;that <HI>Fairfax</HI> had Be|&s;ieged&endq; <HI>Bristol;</HI></Q> for which no body underwent any trouble; for all Men looked upon that place as well Fortified, Manned, and Victualled; and the King even then receiv'd a very chearful Letter from Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> in which, <Q>&startq;&endq; he undertook to defend it full four Months.</Q> So that the <MILESTONE N="50"> Siege being begun &s;o late in the year, as the beginning of <HI>September,</HI> there was rea&s;onable hope that the Army might be ruined, before the Town taken. Therefore the King pro&s;ecuted his former re&s;olution, at
<PB N="535" REF="6070">
lea&s;t to endeavour the relief of <HI>Hereford.</HI> <Q>And as he was upon his march thither, he receiv'd Intelligence, &startq;that the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, upon the no|tice of his Purpo&s;e, was that Morning ri&s;en in great di&s;order and con|fu&s;ion, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The</HI> Scotch <HI>ri&s;e from be|fore</HI> Hereford <HI>and march in|to the North</HI></NOTE> and re&s;olv'd to make their retreat on the <HI>Wel&s;h</HI> &s;ide of the Ri|ver,&endq; and &s;o to pa&s;s through <HI>Gloucester.</HI></Q> This news was &s;o welcome, and his Maje&s;ty was receiv'd with &s;o full joy into the City of <HI>Hereford,</HI> that he &s;lipp'd the opportunity he then had of di&s;commoding at lea&s;t, if not ruining the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army; which now pa&s;&s;ed through a &s;trange Coun|try, where they had never been, and where the whole Nation was ex|tremely odious to the People. <Q>Nor would the Governour of <HI>Gloucester</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;uffer them to pa&s;s through his Garri&s;on, till they &s;ent him word plainly &startq;that if they might not pa&s;s through that Town, they knew they &s;hould&endq; be very welcome to pa&s;s through <HI>Worcester;</HI></Q> by which Argument he was convinced; &s;o that he permitted them to go through that Town, from whence they pro&s;ecuted their march into the North. If, in all this time, they had been pur&s;ued by the King's Hor&s;e, con&s;idering the &s;mall Body they had of their own, there is little doubt to be made, very ma|ny, if not the greater part of that Army, had been de&s;troyed.</P>
<P>BUT the King's heart was now &s;o wholely &s;et upon the relief of <HI>Bri|stol,</HI> that nothing el&s;e was thought upon, which might in any degree <MILESTONE N="20"> delay it. <Q>And &s;o the King, from <HI>Hereford,</HI> adverti&s;ed Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> &startq;that he had rai&s;ed the Siege of <HI>Hereford,</HI> and that the <HI>Scots</HI> were marched Northward; that he intended &s;peedily to relieve him; and in order to it, that he had then commanded General <HI>Goring,</HI> to draw what force he could out of the We&s;t; and to march to the <HI>Somer&s;et|&s;hire</HI> &s;ide of <HI>Bristol;</HI> and that his Maje&s;ty would him&s;elf have a Body of three thou&s;and Foot, drawn out of the &s;everal Garri&s;ons of tho&s;e parts, which &s;hould pa&s;s over the <HI>Severn,</HI> about <HI>Berkley-</HI>Ca&s;tle on <HI>Glou|cester-&s;hire</HI> &s;ide; and that his Hor&s;e, which were then above three thou&s;and, &s;hould at the &s;ame time Ford the <HI>Severn</HI> not far from <HI>Glou|cester&endq;</HI></Q> <MILESTONE N="30"> (as they might have done) <Q>&startq;and &s;o joyn with his Foot; and by this means, all things being well concerted, they might hopefully fall&endq; on <HI>Fairfax</HI> his Quarters on both &s;ides.</Q> And the better to bring all this to pa&s;s, the King him&s;elf went the &s;econd time to <HI>Ragland,</HI> the Hou&s;e of the Marquis of <HI>Worcester;</HI> &s;ending the Hor&s;e to tho&s;e &s;everal places, as might be&s;t facilitate the execution of the de&s;ign that was form'd for the relief of <HI>Bristol.</HI></P>
<P>BUT when the King came to <HI>Ragland,</HI> he receiv'd the terrible infor|mation of the &s;urrender of <HI>Bristol,</HI> which he &s;o little apprehended, that if the evidence thereof had not been unque&s;tionable, it could not have <MILESTONE N="40"> been believ'd. With what indignation, and dejection of mind, the King re|ceiv'd this adverti&s;ment, needs no other de&s;oription and enlargement, than the &s;etting down, in the very words of it, the Letter which the King writ thereupon to Prince <HI>Rupert;</HI> which, con&s;idering the un&s;peak|able indulgence his Maje&s;ty had ever &s;hewed towards that Prince, is &s;uf|ficient evidence, how highly he was offended and incen&s;ed by that Act; which yet he took &s;ome time &s;adly to think of, and con&s;ider, before he would allow him&s;elf to a bate &s;o much of his natural candour towards him. A&s;&s;oon as he receiv'd that &s;urpri&s;ing Intelligence, he pre&s;ently remov'd from <HI>Ragland,</HI> and return'd to <HI>Hereford,</HI> the Po&s;t he cho&s;e wherein to <MILESTONE N="50"> con&s;ider the de&s;peratene&s;s of the condition he was in, and to enter upon new con&s;ultations. <Q>To that purpo&s;e, he &s;ent Orders &startq;for all the Officers, and their Troopes, which had been &s;ent into <HI>Shrop-&s;hire, Worcester|&s;hire,</HI>

<P>WITH this Letter, the King &s;ent a Revocation of all Commi&s;|&s;ions formerly granted to Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and &s;ignified his Plea&s;ure to the Lords of the Council at <HI>Oxford,</HI> whither Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was retir'd <MILESTONE N="30"> with his Troops from <HI>Bristol,</HI> <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould require Prince <HI>Rupert&endq;</HI> to deliver into their hands his Commi&s;&s;ion.</Q> And whether the King had really &s;ome apprehen&s;ion that he might make &s;ome difficulty in giving it up, and make &s;ome di&s;order in <HI>Oxford,</HI> or whether it was the effect of other Men's Coun&s;els, his Maje&s;ty, at the &s;ame time, &s;ent a Warrant likewi&s;e for the pre&s;ent impri&s;onment of Colonel <HI>Leg</HI> (who was Governour of <HI>Oxford)</HI> as a Per&s;on much in the Prince's favour, and therefore like to be &s;ub&s;ervient to any of his Commands. <Q>But this cir|cum&s;tance of rigour, made the other judgement upon the Prince thought to be over &s;uddain, &startq;that He &s;hould be made the fir&s;t Example of the <MILESTONE N="40"> King's Severity, when &s;o many high enormities, and mi&s;carriages of&endq; others had pa&s;&s;ed without being call'd in que&s;tion.</Q> And as no body &s;u&s;pected the Prince's want of Duty in Submitting to the King's Plea|&s;ure, &s;o Colonel <HI>Leg</HI> was generally believed to be a Man of that entire Loyalty to the King, that he was above all temptations: this circum|&s;tance of committing the Governour, made the other to be likewi&s;e &s;u&s;pected to be more the effect of the power of &s;ome Potent adver&s;a|ries, than of the King's own Severity.</P>
<P>WHEN the Prince of <HI>Wales</HI> came to <HI>Launceston</HI> from <HI>Exeter,</HI> (which was about the middle of <HI>September)</HI> after the lo&s;s of <HI>Bristol,</HI> and the <MILESTONE N="50"> motion of the Enemy inclined We&s;tward, it was then thought fit to draw all the Train'd-bands of <HI>Cornwal</HI> to <HI>Launceston,</HI> and as many of them as could be per&s;waded, to march Ea&s;tward; it being agreed at
<PB N="537" REF="6090">
<HI>Exeter,</HI> <Q>&startq;that, if the Enemy gave time, the force of both Counties (&s;ave what was nece&s;&s;ary to be continued at <HI>Plymouth)</HI> &s;hould be drawn&endq; to <HI>Tiverton,</HI> and, upon that Pa&s;s, to fight with the Rebels;</Q> for the better compa&s;&s;ing whereof, it was Ordered, <Q>&startq;that S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> &s;hould command all the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Train'd-bands, whereunto &s;hould be added his own three Regiments, which he had formerly carried to&endq; <HI>Taunton;</HI></Q> who took them&s;elves to be &s;o di&s;obliged, both Officers and Soldiers (as in truth they were) by the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> that they were ab|&s;olutely disbanded, and could by no other means be gotten together, but upon a&s;&s;urance that they &s;hould be Commanded by S^r <HI>Richard</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>Greenvil.</HI> Things being thus &s;ettled, <HI>Greenvil</HI> &s;eem'd well &s;atisfied, having all the re&s;pect, and encouragement from the Prince that was de|&s;ired, or could be given; and without any other indi&s;po&s;ition, than that, once in two or three days, he would write a Letter either to the Prince him&s;elf, the Lords, or M^r <HI>Fan&s;haw,</HI> extolling him&s;elf, and re|proaching the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s plundering Hor&s;e, and &s;ometimes S^r <HI>John Berkley;</HI> in all which he u&s;ed a very extraordinary Licence.</P>
<P><Q>DURING the Prince's being at <HI>Exeter,</HI> S^r <HI>John Berkley</HI> had de&s;ired, &startq;that, in re&s;pect his continual pre&s;ence would be nece&s;&s;ary at <HI>Exeter,</HI> &s;ince the Enemy apparently looked that way, his Highne&s;s would <MILESTONE N="20"> di&s;po&s;e the Command of the Forces before <HI>Plymouth,</HI> to &s;uch a Per|&s;on&endq; as He thought fit; who might diligently attend that Service.</Q> There was a general inclination to have &s;ent back S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> to that Charge, which it was vi&s;ible he looked for; but there were three great points to be con&s;ider'd; the fir&s;t, the pretence that General <HI>Digby</HI> had to that Command; to whom it Originally belonged; and both He, and the Earl of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> expected it upon this alteration; he being at that time &s;o well recover'd in his health, that he was well able to execute the Command: the next, that if it &s;hould be offer'd to <HI>Greenvil,</HI> he would in&s;i&s;t upon &s;uch a&s;&s;ignations of Contributions, as would make the <MILESTONE N="30"> &s;ub&s;i&s;tence of the Army, and of the Garri&s;ons impo&s;&s;ible; the la&s;t and the greate&s;t, was, that the whole de&s;ign being now to draw &s;uch a Body together, as might give the Rebel's Battle, this could not be without the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Train'd-bands, and tho&s;e other Soldiers, who had run from their Colours; neither of which, would march without S^r <HI>Richard Green|vil;</HI> and it was apparent, if he went to <HI>Plymouth,</HI> tho&s;e old Soldiers would go to him. Be&s;ides, his experience and activity was then thought mo&s;t nece&s;&s;ary to the marching Army; where there was a great dearth of good Officers. Hereupon, it was re&s;olv'd that General <HI>Digby</HI> &s;hould again re&s;ume the Charge about <HI>Plymouth,</HI> but upon any extraordinary <MILESTONE N="40"> occa&s;ion, and advance of the Enemy, he was to receive Orders from S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil;</HI> and accordingly, upon S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI>'s ad|vancing into <HI>Devon,</HI> and fixing a Quarter at <HI>Okington, Digby</HI> was or|der'd &s;o to do; which he ob&s;erv'd accordingly.</P>
<P>IN the beginning of <HI>October,</HI> the Lord <HI>Goring</HI> per&s;waded the Com|mi&s;&s;ioners of <HI>Devon,</HI> upon his promi&s;e to puni&s;h and &s;uppre&s;s all di&s;or|ders in the Soldiery, <Q>and that the Markets &s;hould be free, &startq;to double the Contribution of the County for &s;ix Weeks, and to a&s;&s;ign half there|of&endq; to his Army;</Q> by vertue whereof he rai&s;ed va&s;t Sums of Money; but abated nothing of the former di&s;orders, and pre&s;&s;ures: and the Mo|ney <MILESTONE N="50"> &s;o rai&s;ed, in&s;tead of being regularly di&s;tributed among&s;t the Soldiers, was di&s;po&s;ed to &s;uch Per&s;ons as he thought fit by his Warrants to direct.

<P>THE King's having been in that perpetual motion, as hath been men|tion'd before, kept the Expre&s;s that had been &s;ent to him from the Coun&s;ellors, upon the fir&s;t &s;ignification of his plea&s;ure concerning the Prince's Tran&s;portation into <HI>France,</HI> from delivering that Letter for &s;ome time.

<P><Q>UPON the whole matter, comparing his Words, and his Actions, laying his Doing, and his Not doing together, they concluded, &startq;that if he had been confederate with the Enemy, and been corrupted to betray the We&s;t, he could not have taken a more effectual way to do it; &s;ince he had not intere&s;t enough by any Overt Act to have&endq; put it into their power;</Q> and therefore they who had a greater opinion <MILESTONE N="20"> of his Wit, Courage, and Conduct, than of his Con&s;cience, and Inte|grity, pre&s;um'd the failing was in the latter; <Q>towards which opinion they were the more inclined, by many di&s;cour&s;es negligently let fall by the Enemy in their Quarters, &startq;&endq;that they were Sure enough of <HI>Goring;</HI></Q> and by S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI>'s applying him&s;elf to the taking tho&s;e Strong places after the rout at <HI>Lamport,</HI> without ever con&s;idering or looking after the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s Army; which, he could not but know, con|&s;i&s;ted of a body of Hor&s;e, equal in Number to his own; and had rea&s;on to apprehend tho&s;e two populous Counties of <HI>Devon</HI> and <HI>Cornwal,</HI> could quickly recruit the Foot; <Q>&startq;which negligence (&s;aid they) <HI>Fairfax</HI> <MILESTONE N="30"> could never be guilty of, if he had not been well a&s;&s;ured, that tho&s;e&endq; Forces &s;hould work them no inconvenience;</Q> be&s;ides that, being un|pur&s;ued, <HI>Goring</HI> might ea&s;ily have made an e&s;cape, and joyned with the King, and &s;o have diverted all the Enemies de&s;igns upon the We&s;t.</P>
<P>OTHERS, who were not enough in Love with the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> to de&s;ire to be joyn'd with him in any tru&s;t, yet in their opinions clearly ab&s;olved him from any Combination with the Enemy, or de&s;ign of treachery, and imputed the &s;low managing the bu&s;ine&s;s, at his fir&s;t com|ing into the We&s;t, and over&s;lipping &s;ome opportunities of advantage, to his de&s;ire of being &s;etled in that Command, and &s;o not making ha&s;t, <MILESTONE N="40"> le&s;t, the work being done, he might be nece&s;&s;itated to leave tho&s;e Parts, and be call'd to the King; for without doubt, though there was a re|conciliation made between Him and Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> to that degree, that all the Countenance General <HI>Goring</HI> receiv'd from Court in prejudice of the Prince's Authority, and of his Council, was procur'd for him purely by that Prince; who in one of his Letters to him, at &s;uch time as he was before <HI>Taunton,</HI> u&s;ed the&s;e words; <Q>&startq;what you de&s;ire in your Letter, on the 22^d of <HI>May,</HI> &s;hall be ob&s;erv'd; and a&s;&s;ure your &s;elf that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> &s;hall maintain General <HI>Goring</HI>'s honour and power, and &s;hall lo&s;e his life, rather than General <HI>Goring</HI> &s;hall &s;uffer for Prince&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> <HI>Rupert;</HI></Q> which Letter (as he did any others, which he receiv'd from his Maje&s;ty, or the Secretaries, in Cipher) he communicated to the Company in all his Acts of good fellow&s;hip; yet, I &s;ay, it was very evi|dent,
<PB N="542" REF="6150">
he was re&s;olv'd never to be in the &s;ame Army with Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> under his Command; and all his loo&s;e and &s;candalous Speeches, they imputed to an Innate licence he had always given him&s;elf; and his gro&s;s and unfortunate Over&s;ights, to the Lazyne&s;s, and Unactivity of his Nature; which could better pur&s;ue, and make advantages upon good Succe&s;&s;es, than &s;truggle and contend with difficulties and &s;treights. And they who had been neare&s;t the Ob&s;ervation, found a great difference be|tween the pre&s;entne&s;s of his Mind and Vivacity in a &s;uddain Attempt, though never &s;o full of Danger, and an enterpri&s;e that requir'd more deliberation, and mu&s;t be attended with patience, and a &s;teady circum|&s;pection; <MILESTONE N="10"> as if his mind could not be long bent. And therefore he had been ob&s;erv'd to give over a Game, &s;ooner than Game&s;ters that have been thought to have le&s;s fire. Many other pa&s;&s;ages mu&s;t be attributed to his perfect hatred of all the Per&s;ons of the Council, after he found they would not comply with his de&s;ires, and to his particular ambition; and both tho&s;e pa&s;&s;ions of ambition, and revenge, might tran&s;port his Nature beyond any limits. But what he meant by his di&s;cour&s;e at part|ing to the Officers, for the keeping the Hor&s;e for the Service of &s;ome forreign Prince, was never under&s;tood, except he did really believe, that he &s;hould &s;hortly return with a Body of Foot; and &s;o that they &s;hould <MILESTONE N="20"> not be forward to engage with the Enemy, or el&s;e to keep &s;uch a depen|dence upon him from the Officers, that they &s;hould allways hope for em|ployment under him.</P>
<P>WHILST S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> &s;tay'd at <HI>Okington,</HI> he had &s;everal &s;trange de&s;igns; which he always communicated to the Prince, or Lords, in Writing, one of which was, <Q>&startq;to cut a deep Trench from <HI>Barn&s;table</HI> to the South Sea, for the &s;pace of near forty miles; by which he &s;aid,&endq; he would defend all <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and &s;o much of <HI>Devon,</HI> again&s;t the World;</Q> and many &s;uch impo&s;&s;ible undertakings; at which they who under&s;tood matters of that Nature, thought him be&s;ides him&s;elf. Notwith&s;tand|ing <MILESTONE N="30"> the Train'd-bands of <HI>Cornwal</HI> return'd to their homes (having &s;tay'd out their Month; which was their fir&s;t contract) S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> &s;tay'd &s;till at <HI>Okington,</HI> with his three Regiments of old Soldiers, having barricadoed the Town; the Pa&s;s being of very great importance to hin|der the Enemy from any Communication with <HI>Plymouth.</HI> And indeed the reputation of his being there with a greater Strength than intruth he had at any time, was a great means of keeping the Rebels on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of <HI>Exeter;</HI> as appears by their &s;uddain advance, a&s;&s;oon as he removed from that Po&s;t; which he did about the end of <HI>November,</HI> without giving the lea&s;t advice to the Prince of &s;uch his purpo&s;e, and <MILESTONE N="40"> contrary to the expre&s;s de&s;ire of the Lords <HI>Capel,</HI> and <HI>Colepepper,</HI> who were then at <HI>Exeter,</HI> and, hearing of his re&s;olution, <Q>had written to him very earne&s;tly &startq;&endq;not to remove.</Q> He &s;uddainly retir'd with his three Re|giments from <HI>Okington</HI> into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and mu&s;tered his Men upon the River <HI>Tamar,</HI> that divides <HI>Cornwal</HI> from <HI>Devon,</HI> with expre&s;s com|mand <Q>&startq;to guard the Pa&s;&s;es, and not to &s;uffer any of the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s&endq; Men, upon what pretence or warrant &s;oever, to come into <HI>Cornwal.</HI></Q> For the better doing whereof, he cau&s;ed the Country to come in to work at their Bridges, and Pa&s;&s;es, as he had done before, mo&s;t unrea|&s;onably, for the fortifying of <HI>Launceston;</HI> and cau&s;ed Proclamations, <MILESTONE N="50"> and Orders of his own, to be read throughout <HI>Cornwal,</HI> in the Churches, <Q>&startq;&endq; that if any of the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s Forces</Q> (whom in tho&s;e Writings he charged with all the odious reproaches for plundering) <Q>&startq;&s;hould offer to

come into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> they &s;hould ring the Bells; and thereupon the&endq; whole County &s;hould ri&s;e, and beat them out;</Q> by the&s;e unheard of, and unwarrantable means, preparing the Country to &s;uch a hatred of the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> and his Forces, that they rather de&s;ired the Company of the Rebels; &s;o alienating all Mens Spirits from re&s;i&s;ting of the Enemy; and all this without &s;o much as communication with the Prince, till it was executed.</P>
<P>ABOUT the la&s;t week of <HI>November,</HI> he came him&s;elf to <HI>Truro</HI> to the Prince, on the &s;ame day that his Highne&s;s had receiv'd Letters from the Lords at <HI>Exeter,</HI> of the extreme ill con&s;equence of S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI>'s <MILESTONE N="10"> drawing off from <HI>Okington;</HI> upon encouragement whereof, a &s;trong party of the Enemy was come to <HI>Kirton.</HI> Whereupon his Highne&s;s &s;ent for S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil;</HI> and, in Council, acquainted him with tho&s;e Letters, and other Intelligence that he had received of the Enemy, and de&s;ired him to con&s;ider what was now to be done. The next day, without attending his Highne&s;s any more, but returning to his Hou&s;e at <HI>Worrington,</HI> he writ a long Letter to M^r <HI>Fan&s;haw</HI> of his Ad|vice, which he de&s;ired might be communicated to the Lords; <Q>which was, &startq;that his Highne&s;s &s;hould &s;end to the Parliament for a Treaty, and &s;hould offer, if he might enjoy the Revenue of the Dutchy of <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and that they would not advance to di&s;turb him in that Coun|ty, that he would not attempt any thing upon them, but that they &s;hould enjoy the freedom of all their Ports in <HI>Cornwal</HI> for Trade, with|out&endq; any di&s;turbance by his Maje&s;ties Ships: and &s;o, in plain <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI></Q> to &s;it &s;till a Neuter between the King, and the Parliament, at a time when there was a Body of Hor&s;e Superior to the Enemy in tho&s;e parts; and when an equal proportion of Foot might have been gotten toge|ther; and when his Maje&s;ty had not the face of an Army in any other part of <HI>England.</HI> The Prince was very much troubled at this Letter, and the more, becau&s;e he found, S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> had contracted a <MILESTONE N="30"> great friend&s;hip with &s;uch of his Highne&s;s's Servants, as, he had rea&s;on to believe, le&s;s zealous and intent upon the honour, and pro&s;perity of the King; and becau&s;e he had di&s;cover'd he laboured very much to in|fu&s;e a jealou&s;y into the Governour of <HI>Pendennis-</HI>Ca&s;tle, <Q>&startq;that the Prince intended to remove him from that command, and to confer it upon&endq; the Lord <HI>Hopton;</HI> to which purpo&s;e he had written to the Governour from <HI>Okington</HI></Q> (when the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> and the Chancellor, were &s;ent down thither to a&s;&s;i&s;t him in the fortifying and &s;upplying that Ca&s;tle; which if they had not done, it would not have held out, as it did after|wards) <Q>&startq;that the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> had a Commi&s;&s;ion to take that charge <MILESTONE N="40"> from him; but that he &s;hould not &s;uffer &s;uch an affront to be put&endq; upon him;</Q> for He, and all his Friends, would &s;tick to him in it: Whereas there was never the lea&s;t thought or intention to make any al|teration in that Government.</P>
<P>SHORTLY after that Letter of the 27^t^h, S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> writ again to M^r <HI>Fan&s;haw,</HI> to know how his Propo&s;itions were approved; <Q>to which, by direction, he return'd, &startq;that the Council had not been yet together &s;ince the receipt of them; the Lords <HI>Capel,</HI> and <HI>Cole|pepper,</HI> being not then return'd from <HI>Exeter;</HI> and that therefore his&endq; Propo&s;itions had not been yet Debated.</Q> He proceeded in the mean <MILESTONE N="50"> time in his Fortifications there, and, about the middle of <HI>December,</HI> the Prince continuing at <HI>Truro,</HI> <Q>he &s;ent &s;everal Letters to the Gentlemen of the County &startq;&endq;to meet him at <HI>Launce&s;ton:</HI></Q> One of which Letters I &s;aw,

to Colonel <HI>Richard Arundel;</HI> <Q>in which, &startq;he de&s;ired him to bring as many Gentlemen, and others of Ability, as he could, as well the di&s;|affected, as well-affected; for that he intended to communicate to them &s;ome Propo&s;itions, which he had formerly preferr'd to the Prince, and though they were not hearken'd to There, he believ'd would be very&endq; acceptable to his Country-men of <HI>Cornwal:</HI> but the Prince's &s;uddain going to <HI>Tavi&s;tock</HI> di&s;appointed that meeting.</Q></P>
<P>SHORTLY after the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s going into <HI>France,</HI> the Prince, being inform'd from <HI>Exeter,</HI> <Q>&startq;that the Enemy, at the &s;ame time having fini&s;hed their works, which kept the City from any relief on the Ea&s;t <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;ide, were now drawing their Forces to the We&s;t &s;ide, whereby that&endq; City would be &s;peedily di&s;tre&s;&s;ed;</Q> thought it nece&s;&s;ary to &s;end the Lords <HI>Brentford, Capel, Hopton,</HI> and <HI>Colepepper,</HI> to confer with the Lord <HI>Wentworth;</HI> who lay then at <HI>A&s;h Burton,</HI> &s;ix Miles from <HI>Totne&s;s,</HI> and with S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> who was ready to draw &s;ome Foot into <HI>Devon,</HI> to the end that &s;uch an under&s;tanding might be &s;ettled between them two, that the Service might proceed: their Lord&s;hips being di|rected, by In&s;tructions under his Highne&s;s's hand, upon con&s;ideration of the &s;tate of the Forces, and conference with the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> and S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> to advi&s;e what &s;peedy cour&s;e &s;hould be taken for <MILESTONE N="20"> the relief of <HI>Exeter</HI> (the Prince having at the &s;ame time disbur&s;ed a thou&s;and pound ready Money to two Merchants of <HI>Exeter,</HI> for Provi|&s;ion of <HI>Corn</HI> for that City) pre&s;uming that both the one and the other would have been very ready to have receiv'd, and followed the advice which their Lord&s;hips &s;hould give.</P>
<P>THE place of meeting was appointed to be <HI>Tavi&s;tock;</HI> where every body was, &s;ave the Lord <HI>Wentworth;</HI> but He failing, the Lords, having directed S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> how to di&s;po&s;e of him&s;elf, went them&s;elves to <HI>A&s;h Burton,</HI> near twenty miles further to the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Quarter; where they &s;pent a day or two, but found not that re&s;pect <MILESTONE N="30"> from him they had rea&s;on to have expected. His Lord&s;hip was very jealous of diminution in his Command, which General <HI>Goring</HI> had de|volv'd to him, and expre&s;&s;ing him&s;elf oftentimes to them very unne|ce&s;&s;arily, <Q>&startq;that he would receive Orders from none but the Prince Him|&s;elf;&endq;</Q> whereupon, and upon the importunate calling for relief from <HI>Exeter,</HI> their Lord&s;hips <Q>&startq;thought it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, that the Prince him&s;elf &s;hould advance in Per&s;on, as well to bring up as great a Body of the <HI>Corni&s;h,</HI> as was po&s;&s;ible (which without his pre&s;ence was not to be hoped for) as to di&s;po&s;e the Command of the whole Forces in &s;uch manner, as might probably be for the be&s;t advantage; the be&s;t that <MILESTONE N="40"> was to be hoped for being to bring the Enemy to Fight a Battle; and that they might be enabled to that purpo&s;e, by joyning with the Foot&endq; that were in <HI>Exeter;</HI></Q> which was a con&s;iderable Body. For the con|ducting &s;o great a de&s;ign, upon which no le&s;s than three Crowns de|pended, the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> could not be thought of intere&s;t, expe|rience, or reputation enough; and yet there was &s;o great regard, that he &s;hould not &s;uffer in his honour, or the imaginary Tru&s;t devolv'd to him by General <HI>Goring,</HI> or rather indeed that no notable hazard might be run, by any unnece&s;&s;ary mutation in Commands, at a time when the Soldier was to be led to Fight, that it was re&s;olv'd, <Q>&startq;that he &s;hould be <MILESTONE N="50"> rather Advi&s;ed, than Commanded; and that if he comported him&s;elf with that temper and mode&s;ty, as was expected, all re&s;olutions &s;hould&endq; be form'd in Council, and all Orders thereupon &s;hould i&s;&s;ue in His Name.</Q></P>

THE next day after <HI>Chri&s;tmas</HI> day, the weather being very &s;harp, the Prince went from <HI>Truro</HI> to <HI>Bodmin;</HI> and the next day to <HI>Tavi&s;tock;</HI> where the Lords of the Council attended; the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> con|tinuing at <HI>A&s;h Burton,</HI> and his Hor&s;e &s;pread over that part of the Coun|try which was at any di&s;tance from the Enemy. S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> who attended likewi&s;e at <HI>Tavi&s;tock,</HI> had &s;ent three Regiments of Foot to <HI>Okington,</HI> under the Command of Major General <HI>Mole&s;worth;</HI> which were &s;ecured by the Brigade of Hor&s;e under Major General <HI>Web,</HI> who was Quarter'd near tho&s;e parts, and the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Train'd-bands were to come up within a week; the Blockade before <HI>Plymouth</HI> was mantain'd <MILESTONE N="10"> by General <HI>Digby,</HI> with about twelve or thirteen hundred Foot, and &s;ix hundred Hor&s;e; but the whole Contribution a&s;&s;ign'd for the &s;upport of tho&s;e Forces, was taken by the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Hor&s;e; &s;o that the Prince was compell'd to &s;upply tho&s;e Men, out of the Magazines of Victual which he had provided in <HI>Cornwal</HI> for the Army when it &s;hould march; and to leave his own Guard of Hor&s;e upon the skirts of <HI>Corn|wal;</HI> there being no Quarter to be had for them nearer his own Per&s;on.</P>
<P>ABOUT this time, S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> Quarter'd at a Hou&s;e about two miles Ea&s;t of <HI>Exeter,</HI> S^r <HI>Hardre&s;s Waller</HI> with a Brigade of his Ar|my at <HI>Kirton,</HI> and another part of the Army had po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed <HI>Powdram-</HI>Hou&s;e, <MILESTONE N="20"> and the Church, <HI>Hulford-</HI>Hou&s;e, and &s;ome other Holds on the We&s;t &s;ide; &s;o that no Provi&s;ions went in, and it hath been &s;aid before, how long the Army under <HI>Goring</HI> had &s;ub&s;i&s;ted upon the Provi&s;ions within, and kept all &s;upply from entring: the advice taken at <HI>Tavi&s;tock,</HI> upon the Prince's coming thither, was, <Q>&startq;that a&s;&s;oon as the <HI>Corni&s;h</HI> Foot &s;hould be come up, his Highne&s;s &s;hould march with tho&s;e, his own Guards, and as many Foot as might conveniently be taken from be|fore <HI>Plymouth,</HI> by leaving Hor&s;e in their place, to <HI>Totne&s;s;</HI> where a Magazine &s;hould be made of Provi&s;ions for the whole Army, both by Money (for which the County would yield great &s;tore of Provi&s;ions)&endq; and by Victuals brought out of <HI>Cornwal</HI> by Sea;</Q> for which likewi&s;e <MILESTONE N="30"> directions were given: <Q>&startq;From that place it was concluded, that the Prince might joyn with the Forces in <HI>Exeter,</HI> except the Rebels &s;hould draw their whole Body between them; and then that Garri&s;on would be able both to relieve it &s;elf, and to infe&s;t the Enemy in the Rear; and the Prince might retire, or Fight, as he found it mo&s;t convenient&endq; and advantageous to him.</Q> Re&s;olutions being thus fixed, and the <HI>Cor|ni&s;h</HI> being not expected in full Numbers till the Week following, the Prince cho&s;e to go to <HI>Totne&s;s;</HI> where all things nece&s;&s;ary might be agreed with the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who might conveniently attend there, his <MILESTONE N="40"> Quarters being within &s;ix miles; and where directions might be given for making the Magazine, towards which Money had been return'd out of <HI>Cornwal.</HI></P>
<P>THE next day after the Prince came thither, the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> attended him, and was inform'd in Council, what had been thought rea|&s;onable at <HI>Tavi&s;tock;</HI> the which he approv'd of; the Prince then call'd to &s;ee a Li&s;t of the Quarters, that thereupon it might be agreed how the whole Army &s;hould be Quarter'd when they came together; to which end, the next day, the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> brought the Quarter-Ma&s;ter General <HI>Pinkney,</HI> who indeed govern'd him. <Q>At the fir&s;t Council, <MILESTONE N="50"> the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> told the Prince, &startq;that he was to declare one thing to him, at the entrance into bu&s;ine&s;s, and for the prevention of any mi&s;takes, that he could receive no Orders from any Per&s;on but his

The time was not conceiv'd &s;ea&s;onable for the Prince to declare how the Army &s;hould be commanded, till he had brought it together, and till he had his own Guards about him; and &s;o the Prince, though he was nothing &s;atisfied in the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s carriage, on|ly told him <Q>&startq;that he would take the Command of the Army upon Him|&s;elf,&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> and i&s;&s;ue out Orders as he &s;hould think fit;</Q> and having vi&s;ited the Port and Garri&s;on of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> and taken &s;ufficient cour&s;e for the providing the Magazines, and &s;ettled the differences about quartering, he return'd to <HI>Tavi&s;tock;</HI> re&s;olving, with all po&s;&s;ible expedition, to march with the whole Body of Foot to <HI>Totne&s;s,</HI> according to former appointment.</P>

<P>HIS Highne&s;s, as he u&s;ed to do, a&s;&s;oon as he had peru&s;ed the Letter, which, as the re&s;t, was written in the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI>'s Cipher, and by him decipher'd, deliver'd it again to his Lord&s;hip, <Q>&startq;to be &s;ecretly kept,&endq; and communicated to the other three;</Q> for it was by no means yet &s;afe to tru&s;t it farther. They were much troubled at the receipt of this Let|ter; for, be&s;ides that it found them in the Article of the mo&s;t probable <MILESTONE N="30"> de&s;ign had been on foot &s;ince the late di&s;a&s;ters, to pre&s;erve the We&s;t; if they &s;hould have attempted to have given obedience to that Com|mand, the &s;uddain, unexpected, and unrea&s;onable leaving the Army, would vi&s;ibly have declared what the intent had been, and would pro|bably have engaged the People, and the Soldiers (who would have want|ed neither Intelligence, nor In&s;tigation from the Prince's own Servants; of whom the Lords could not rely upon three Men) they being full of hope in the enterpri&s;e they were upon, and full of di&s;like of the other they were to choo&s;e, to have prevented it; in which, they might rea|&s;onably have expected a&s;&s;i&s;tance from the Garri&s;on of <HI>Pendennis;</HI> from <MILESTONE N="40"> which place his Highne&s;s was nece&s;&s;arily to remove him&s;elf. So that if the Prince &s;hould attempt to go, and &s;ucceed, the Army, upon that di&s;countenance, mu&s;t di&s;&s;olve; and if he &s;ucceeded not, there might be a fatal con&s;equence of the endeavour and di&s;appointment. Then, though they had long kept a Ship in the Harbour in readine&s;s, and had at that time another Frigat of M^r <HI>Ha&s;duncks,</HI> yet by its having been carried with &s;o much &s;ecrecy that very few had taken notice of it, they could not be provided for &s;o long a Voyage as to <HI>Denmark,</HI> which, with &s;o important a charge, would require two Months Victual at lea&s;t. But that which troubled them mo&s;t, was the very Argument which his Ma|je&s;ty <MILESTONE N="50"> was plea&s;ed to u&s;e for his &s;o po&s;itive command; which, to their under&s;tanding, &s;eem'd to conclude rather, that his Highne&s;s's Tran&s;por|tation (at lea&s;t without an immediate ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity) was at that
<PB N="548" REF="6210">
time mo&s;t un&s;ea&s;onable: for if, in expectation of a Treaty, his Maje&s;ty &s;hould venture his Royal Per&s;on in <HI>London,</HI> and &s;hould be receiv'd there, and at the &s;ame time his Highne&s;s's Per&s;on &s;hould be Tran&s;ported out of the Kingdom, by his Maje&s;ties own Commands (which could not then have been concealed) it was rea&s;onable to believe, that not only the Rebels would make great advantage of it, as an Argument again&s;t his Maje&s;ties &s;incere intentions, and thereby draw un&s;peakable and ir|reparable prejudice upon him; but that his own Council, by which he was di&s;po&s;ed to that Overture, and who&s;e A&s;&s;i&s;tance he mu&s;t con&s;tantly u&s;e, would take them&s;elves to be highly di&s;obliged by that Act; and <MILESTONE N="10"> they would lo&s;e all confidence in their future Coun&s;els.</P>
<P><Q>UPON the whole Matter, the Lords were unanimou&s;ly of opinion, &startq;that the relief of <HI>Exeter</HI> was to proceed in the manner formerly agreed,&endq; and that the Prince's Per&s;on was to be pre&s;ent at it: and thereupon they &s;ent an Expre&s;s to the King,</Q> with a di&s;patch &s;ign'd by the Four who were tru&s;ted, a Duplicate whereof was &s;ent by another Expre&s;s the next day, in which they pre&s;ented a clear &s;tate to his Maje&s;ty of his Forces, and the hopes they then had of improving their condition by the Prince's pre&s;ence; of the condition of <HI>Exeter,</HI> and of the &s;trength, as they conceiv'd, of the Enemy; and of the inconveniency, if not the <MILESTONE N="20"> impo&s;&s;ibility of obeying his Maje&s;ty at that time. <Q>They farther inform'd his Maje&s;ty of &startq;the great indi&s;po&s;ition, that they perceiv'd in all the Servants towards his Highne&s;s leaving the Kingdom; and that the jea|lou&s;y was &s;o great of his going into <HI>France,</HI> that they had rea&s;on to be|lieve that many who were very faithful, and tender of his &s;afety, would rather wi&s;h him in the hands of the Enemy, than in that Kingdom; and therefore, when the time of Nece&s;&s;ity &s;hould come (which they a&s;&s;ured his Maje&s;ty they would with any hazard watch and ob&s;erve) they mu&s;t prefer the continuing him &s;till within his Maje&s;ties own Do|minions, and &s;o to waft him to <HI>Silly,</HI> or <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> and from thence con|clude&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> what was to be done farther.</Q> They pre&s;ented likewi&s;e their hum|ble opinion to him, <Q>&startq;that in ca&s;e he &s;hould be engaged in a Per&s;onal Treaty at <HI>London</HI> (which they conceiv'd the Rebels would never ad|mit, without &s;uch Acts fir&s;t obtain'd from his Maje&s;ty, as might in|validate His Power, and confirm Theirs) how inconvenient it might be, without the Privity of tho&s;e Coun&s;ellors, whom he was then to tru&s;t, to Tran&s;port the Prince, except in danger of &s;urpri&s;al, before&endq; the i&s;&s;ue of that Treaty might be di&s;cerned:</Q> <Q>a&s;&s;uring his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that nothing &s;hould put his Highne&s;s's Per&s;on into the hands of the Parlia|ment, but his Maje&s;ties own commands; which they &s;hould not re&s;i&s;t <MILESTONE N="40"> in his own Dominions, nor, they conceiv'd, any body el&s;e, if he were&endq; out of them.</Q></P>
<P>THE appearance at <HI>Tavi&s;tock</HI> an&s;wer'd the expectation; there being <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Wentworth<HI>'s Hor&s;e beaten at</HI> A&s;h Burton.</NOTE> full two thou&s;and four hundred of the Train'd-bands, very chearful, and ready to march; at <HI>Okington</HI> were eight hundred old Soldiers, under Major General <HI>Mole&s;worth;</HI> the Foot with the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> were given out to be eight hundred, with the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s Guards which were in <HI>Dartmouth;</HI> and to be drawn thence, upon the advance to the Army: from <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> the Governour had promi&s;ed to &s;end five hun|dred Men; and out of <HI>Exeter,</HI> at the lea&s;t, a thou&s;and five hundred Men <MILESTONE N="50"> were promi&s;ed: all which, with his Highne&s;s's Guards, might well be depended upon for &s;ix thou&s;and Foot. The Hor&s;e was very little fewer than five thou&s;and; whereof his Highne&s;s's Guards made near &s;even
<PB N="549" REF="6220">
hundred; &s;o that, if all the&s;e could have been brought to Fight, the day &s;eem'd not de&s;perate. <Q>The Foot were appointed to have marched the morrow, when the News came, &startq;that the Enemy was advanced, and&endq; had beaten up the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI>'s Quarters in two-&s;everal places;</Q> and &s;hortly after the News, the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> him&s;elf came in, in great di&s;order, not inform'd of the particular of his lo&s;s, but conceiv'd it to be greater than in truth it was, though many Men, and more Hor&s;es, were taken in both places. The Prince was very de&s;irous to pur&s;ue the former re&s;olution, and to have advanced with the whole Body to <HI>Tot|ne&s;s;</HI> <Q>but the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> did not only alledge, &startq;that probably <MILESTONE N="10"> the Enemy was po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed by that time of <HI>Totne&s;s,</HI> but that he had in truth no hope to rally his Hor&s;e together, in any Numbers, till they&endq; might be allowed three or four days re&s;t.</Q> Whereas all that rout had been occa&s;ion'd by &s;mall Parties of the Enemy, who, at day time, came into their Quarters, and found no Guards, but all the Hor&s;e in the Sta|bles; and their whole Body moved not in two or three days after; en|couraged, it was thought, by the great di&s;order they found tho&s;e Troops to be in. Matters &s;tanding thus, and it being ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, by rea&s;on of this di&s;orderly retreat of the Hor&s;e, to draw off the Blockade from <HI>Plymouth, Tavi&s;tock</HI> was no longer thought a place for the Prince's <MILESTONE N="20"> re&s;idence; his Highne&s;s by the Advice of a Council of War removed to <HI>Launceston;</HI> whither all the Foot were drawn, and the Hor&s;e appointed to keep the <HI>Devon-&s;hire</HI> &s;ide of the River; and from thence he hoped he &s;hould be &s;peedily able to advance towards <HI>Exete$&punc;</HI></P>
<P>THE King had &s;tayed at <HI>Hereford,</HI> as hath been &s;aid, in great per|plexity, and irre&s;olution; not knowing which way to take, but mo&s;t inclined to go to <HI>Worcester;</HI> <Q>till he was a&s;&s;ured, &startq;that the whole &s;trength of the Parliament in the North was gather'd together under the Com|mand of <HI>Pointz;</HI> and that he was already come between <HI>Hereford</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI> with a Body of above three thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Dragoons;&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> with which he was appointed allways to attend the King's motion: &s;o that it would be very hard for his Maje&s;ty to get to <HI>Worcester,</HI></Q> whi|ther his purpo&s;e of going was, upon the new re&s;olution he had taken again to march into <HI>Scotland</HI> to joyn with <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> who was yet under&s;tood to be pro&s;perous. <Q>This being the only de&s;ign, it was not thought rea&s;onable &startq;to pro&s;ecute that march by <HI>Worcester,</HI> and there|by to run the hazard of an engagement with <HI>Pointz;</HI> but rather to take a more &s;ecure pa&s;&s;age through North <HI>Wales</HI> to <HI>Chester;</HI> and thence, through <HI>Lanca&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Cumberland,</HI> to find a way into <HI>Scotland,&endq;</HI> unob&s;tructed by any Enemy that could oppo&s;e them.</Q> This Coun&s;el <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King marches to</HI> Che&s;ter, <HI>where his Hor&s;e are routed by</HI> Pointz.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"> plea&s;ed; and within four days, though through very unplea&s;ant ways, the King came within half a days Journey of <HI>Chester;</HI> which he found in more danger than he &s;u&s;pected; for within three days before, the Enemy, out of their Neighbour Garri&s;ons, had &s;urpri&s;ed both the out|works, and Suburbs of <HI>Che&s;ter;</HI> and had made &s;ome attempt upon the City, to the great terror, and con&s;ternation of tho&s;e within; who had no apprehen&s;ion of &s;uch a &s;urpri&s;e. So that this unexpected coming of his Maje&s;ty, looked like a de&s;ignation of Providence for the pre&s;erva|tion of &s;o important a place: and the Be&s;iegers were no le&s;s amazed, looking upon them&s;elves as lo&s;t, and the King's Troops believ'd them <MILESTONE N="50"> to be in their power.</P>
<P>S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> was &s;ent with mo&s;t of the Hor&s;e over <HI>Holt-</HI>Bridge, that he might be on the Ea&s;t &s;ide of the River <HI>Dee;</HI> and the
<PB N="550" REF="6230">
King, with his Guards, the Lord <HI>Gerrard,</HI> and the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e, marched directly into <HI>Chester,</HI> with a re&s;olution, <Q>&startq;that, early the day following, S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> &s;hould have fallen upon the back&endq; of the Enemy, when all the force of the Town &s;hould have Sallied out, and &s;o inclo&s;ed them.</Q> But S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> being that Night drawn on a Heath two miles from <HI>Chester,</HI> had intercepted a Letter from <HI>Pointz</HI> (who had marched a much &s;horter way, after he was in|form'd which way the King was bound) to the Commander that was before <HI>Chester,</HI> telling him, <Q>&startq;that he was come to their re&s;cue, and de&s;iring to have &s;ome Foot &s;ent to him, to a&s;&s;i&s;t him again&s;t the King's&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> Hor&s;e: and the next morning he appear'd, and was Charged by S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> and forced to retire with lo&s;s;</Q> but kept &s;till at &s;uch a di&s;tance, that the Foot from before <HI>Chester</HI> might come to him. The Be&s;iegers begun to draw out of the Suburbs in &s;uch ha&s;t, that it was believ'd in <HI>Chester,</HI> they were upon their flight; and &s;o mo&s;t of the Hor&s;e and Foot in the Town, had order to pur&s;ue them. But the others ha&s;t was to joyn with <HI>Pointz;</HI> which they quickly did; and then they Charged S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale;</HI> who, being overpower'd, was routed, and put to flight; and pur&s;ued by <HI>Pointz</HI> even to the Walls of <HI>Che&s;ter.</HI> There the Earl of <HI>Lichfield</HI> with the King's Guards, and the Lord <HI>Ger|rard</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> with the re&s;t of the Hor&s;e, were drawn up, and Charged <HI>Pointz,</HI> and forced him to retire. But the di&s;order of tho&s;e Hor&s;e which fir&s;t fled, had &s;o filled the narrow ways, which were unfit for Hor&s;e to fight in, that at la&s;t the Enemies Mu&s;queteers compelled the King's Hor&s;e to turn, and to rout one another, and to overbear their own Officers, who would have re&s;train'd them. Here fell many Gentlemen, and Officers, of Name, with the brave Earl of <HI>Lichfield;</HI> who was the third Brother of that illu&s;trious Family, that &s;acrificed their lives in this quarrel. He was a very faultle&s;s young Man, of a mo&s;t gentle, courteous, and affa|ble nature, and of a &s;pirit and courage invincible; who&s;e lo&s;s all Men <MILESTONE N="30"> exceedingly lamented, and the King bore it with extraordinary grief. There were many Per&s;ons of Quality taken Pri&s;oners, among&s;t whom S^r <HI>Philip Mu&s;grave,</HI> a Gentleman of a noble extraction, and ample For|tune in <HI>Cumberland</HI> and <HI>Westmoreland;</HI> who lived to engage him&s;elf again in the &s;ame Service, and with the &s;ame Affection, and, after very great Sufferings, to &s;ee the King Re&s;tored. This defeat broke all the Body of Hor&s;e, which had attended the King from the Battle of <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> and which now fled over all the Country to &s;ave them&s;elves; and were as much di&s;per&s;ed, as the greate&s;t Rout could produce.</P>
<P>THE de&s;ign of marching Northward, was now at an end; and it <MILESTONE N="40"> was well it was &s;o; for about this very time <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> was defeated by <HI>David Le&s;ley;</HI> &s;o that if the King had advanced farther, as he re|&s;olv'd to have done, the very next day after he came to <HI>Chester,</HI> he could never have been able to have retreated. He &s;tay'd in <HI>Che&s;ter</HI> only one Night after this blow, but returned, by the &s;ame way by which he had come, to <HI>Denbigh-</HI>Ca&s;tle in North <HI>Wales,</HI> being attended only <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King re|tires to</HI> Den|bigh <HI>to rally his Hor&s;e.</HI></NOTE> with five hundred Hor&s;e; and there he &s;tay'd three days to refre&s;h him|&s;elf, and to rally &s;uch of his Troops as had &s;topped within any di&s;tance. So that, in a &s;hort time, he had in view four and twenty hundred Hor&s;e; but whither to go with them was &s;till the difficult que&s;tion. <Q>Some <MILESTONE N="50"> propo&s;ed &startq;the I&s;le of <HI>Angle&s;ey,</HI> as a place of Safety, and an I&s;land Fruitful enough to &s;upport his Forces; which would defend it &s;elf again&s;t any Winter attempt, and from whence he might be ea&s;ily&endq;

tran&s;ported into <HI>Ireland</HI> or <HI>Scotland.</HI></Q> They who objected again&s;t this, as very many objections might well be made, propo&s;ed <Q>&startq;that his Ma|je&s;ty might commodiou&s;ly make his winter Quarters at <HI>Worcester,</HI> and by Quartering his Troops upon the <HI>Severn,</HI> between <HI>Bridgenorth</HI> and <HI>Worcester,</HI> &s;tand there upon his Guard; and by the acce&s;s of &s;ome&endq; other Forces, might be able to Fight with <HI>Pointz;</HI></Q> who, by this time, that he might both be able the more to &s;treighten <HI>Chester,</HI> and to watch the King's motion, had drawn his Troops over the River <HI>Dee</HI> into <HI>Den|bigh-&s;hire;</HI> &s;o that he was now nearer the King, and made the march la&s;t propo&s;ed, much the more difficult; but there was &s;o little choice, <MILESTONE N="10"> that it was pro&s;ecuted, and with good Succe&s;s; and there being another Bridge to pa&s;s the <HI>Dee</HI> &s;ome miles further, and through as ill ways as any tho&s;e Countries have, his Maje&s;ty went over without any oppo&s;i|tion; and had, by this means, left <HI>Pointz</HI> a full days Journey behind. Here Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> waited on his Maje&s;ty with eight hundred Hor&s;e, part whereof was of Prince <HI>Rupert</HI>'s Regiment that came out of <HI>Bri|&s;tol.</HI> And now being thus &s;trengthened, they le&s;s apprehended the Enemy; yet continued their march without re&s;ting, till, by Fording the <HI>Severn,</HI> they came to <HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> the place de&s;ign'd. Now every body <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Bridgenorth.</NOTE> expected, that they &s;hould forthwith go to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and take up their <MILESTONE N="20"> winter Quarters; but upon the news of the &s;urrender of <HI>Berkley-</HI>Ca&s;tle in <HI>Glouce&s;ter-&s;hire,</HI> and of the <HI>Devizes</HI> in <HI>Wilt&s;hire,</HI> two &s;trong Garri|&s;ons of the King's, it was urged, <Q>&startq;that <HI>Worcester</HI> would not be a good place for the King's Winter re&s;idence, and <HI>Newark</HI> was propo&s;ed as&endq; a place of more &s;ecurity.</Q> This advice was the more like to be em|braced, becau&s;e it was vehemently pur&s;ued upon a private, and par|ticular Intere&s;t.</P>
<P>THOUGH Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> had Submitted to the King's plea&s;ure, in re&s;igning his Commi&s;&s;ion, yet he re&s;olv'd not to make u&s;e of his Pa&s;s, and to quit the Kingdom, till he might fir&s;t &s;ee his Maje&s;ty, and give an <MILESTONE N="30"> account of the Rea&s;ons which oblig'd him to deliver up <HI>Bri&s;tol;</HI> and was ready to begin his Journey towards him, a&s;&s;oon as he could be inform'd where the King intended to re&s;t. The Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who had then the chief influence upon his Maje&s;ties Councils, and was generally be|liev'd to be the &s;ole cau&s;e of revoking the Prince's Commi&s;&s;ion, and of the Order &s;ent to him to leave the Kingdom, without being heard what he could &s;ay for him&s;elf, found that the odium of all this proceed|ing fell upon Him; and therefore, to prevent the breaking of that cloud upon him, which threatned his ruin (for he had not only the indignation of Prince <HI>Rupert,</HI> and all His Party to contend with, but the extreme <MILESTONE N="40"> malice of the Lord <HI>Gerrard;</HI> who u&s;ed to hate heartily upon a Suddain accident, without knowing why; over and above this, as Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> would have an ea&s;y Journey to <HI>Worcester,</HI> &s;o Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> was Go|vernour there, who had a very tender &s;en&s;e of the &s;everity his Brother had undergon, and was ready to revenge it; whereas if the King went to <HI>Newark,</HI> the Journey from <HI>Oxford</HI> thither would be much more difficult, and Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> would be without any Authority there) the&s;e rea&s;ons were motives enough to the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> to be very Solli|citous to divert the King from <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> and to incline him to <HI>Newark;</HI> and his credit was &s;o great, that again&s;t the opinion of every other Man, <MILESTONE N="50"> the King re&s;olv'd to take that cour&s;e; &s;o having &s;tay'd only one day at <HI>Bridgenorth,</HI> and from thence &s;ent S^r <HI>Thomas Glemham</HI> to receive the Government of <HI>Oxford,</HI> he made ha&s;t to <HI>Lichfield;</HI> and then pa&s;&s;ed with
<PB N="552" REF="6260">
that &s;peed to <HI>Newark,</HI> that he was there a&s;&s;oon as the Governour had <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence to</HI> Newark.</NOTE> notice of his purpo&s;e. In this manner, in the greate&s;t perplexity of his own affairs, was his Maje&s;ty compell'd to conde&s;cend to the particular, and private pa&s;&s;ions of other Men.</P>
<P>WHEN the King came to <HI>Newark,</HI> he betook him&s;elf to the re|gulating <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The condition of the Garri|&s;on of</HI> New|ark <HI>at this time.</HI></NOTE> the di&s;orders of that Garri&s;on; which, by their great luxury and exce&s;&s;es, in a time of &s;o general calamity, had given ju&s;t &s;candal to the Commi&s;&s;ioners, and to all the Country. The Garri&s;on con&s;i&s;ted of about two thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot; and to tho&s;e there were about four and twenty Colonels and general Officers, who had all liberal A&s;|&s;ignments <MILESTONE N="10"> out of the Contributions, according to their Qualities; &s;o that though that &s;mall County paid more Contribution than any other of that bigne&s;s in <HI>England,</HI> there was very little left to pay the com|mon Soldiers, or to provide for any other expences. This made &s;o great a noi&s;e, that the King found it ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary to reform it; and reduced &s;ome of the Officers entirely, and le&s;&s;ened the Pay of others; which added to the number of the Di&s;contented; which was very much too numerous before. Now reports were &s;pread abroad with great confidence, and the adverti&s;ement &s;ent from &s;everal places, though no Author named, <Q>&startq;that <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> after his defeat, by an acce&s;s of <MILESTONE N="20"> tho&s;e Troops which were then ab&s;ent, had Fought again with <HI>David Le&s;ley;</HI> and totally defeated him; and that he was marched towards&endq; the Borders with a &s;trong Army.</Q> This News, how groundle&s;s &s;oever, was &s;o very good that it was ea&s;ily believed, and believed to that degree, that the King him&s;elf declared a re&s;olution, the third time, <Q>&startq;to advance,&endq; and joyn with <HI>Mountro&s;e;</HI></Q> and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> (who knew that Prince <HI>Rupert</HI> was already upon his way from <HI>Oxford,</HI> and that Prince <HI>Maurice</HI> had met him at <HI>Banbury)</HI> prevail'd &s;o far, that the King re|&s;olv'd, without delay, or expecting any confirmation of the Report, <Q>&startq;to move Northward to meet the News, and if it fell not out to&endq; <MILESTONE N="30"> his Wi&s;h he would return to <HI>Newark.</HI></Q> In this re&s;olution, after a Weeks &s;tay at <HI>Newark,</HI> he marched to <HI>Tuxford;</HI> and, the next day, to <HI>Wellbeck,</HI> having, in his way, met with the &s;ame General Reports of <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI>'s Victories; which were interpreted as &s;o many confirma|tions; and therefore, though the King a&s;&s;embled his Council to con|&s;ult at <HI>Wellbeck,</HI> <Q>he declared &startq;that he would not have it debated, whether he &s;hould advance or retire; but concerning the manner of his advancing; &s;ince he was re&s;olv'd not to retire; which he was &s;ure would be attended with more mi&s;chief than could accompany his&endq; advancing.</Q> <MILESTONE N="40"></P>
<P>THIS Declaration, how di&s;agreeable &s;oever it was to the &s;en&s;e of much the Major part, left very little to be con&s;ulted upon; for &s;ince they mu&s;t advance, it was ea&s;ily agreed <Q>&startq;that they &s;hould march the next day to <HI>Rotheram;</HI> and that the Troops &s;hould be drawn to a&endq; Rendezvous, the next Morning, at &s;uch an hour;</Q> and &s;o the Officers were ri&s;ing to give Orders out for the execution of what was re&s;olved; when, in the in&s;tant, one knocked at the door; who, being call'd in, was found to be the Trumpeter formerly &s;ent from <HI>Cardiff</HI> to the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, with a Letter to the Earl of <HI>Leven,</HI> General thereof; who had taken him with him as far as <HI>Berwick,</HI> before he would &s;uffer him to be <MILESTONE N="50"> di&s;charged. <Q>The King asked him, &startq;what he had heard of the Marqui&s;s of&endq; <HI>Mountro&s;e?</HI></Q> <Q>he an&s;wered, &startq;that the la&s;t news he had heard of him, was, that he was about <HI>Sterling,</HI> retiring farther North; and that <HI>David</HI>
<PB N="553" REF="6270">
<HI>Le&s;ley</HI> was in <HI>Lothian,</HI> on this &s;ide <HI>Edenborough;</HI> and that the <HI>Scotch&endq;</HI> Army lay between North <HI>Allerton</HI> and <HI>New-Castle.</HI></Q> This &s;o unexpected Relation, da&s;hed the former purpo&s;e; <Q>and the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> him&s;elf de|clared, &startq;that it was by no means fit for his Maje&s;ty to advance; but&endq; to retire pre&s;ently to <HI>Newark;</HI></Q> which was, by every body, agreed to; and the Rendezvous of the Army for the next Morning to continue. When they were at the Rendezvous, the King declar'd, <Q>&startq;that though it was not judged fit for Him&s;elf to advance Northward, yet he thought it very nece&s;&s;ary, that S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> &s;hould, with the Hor&s;e under his command, march that way; and endeavour to joyn with&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> <HI>Mountro&s;e.</HI></Q> And, having &s;aid &s;o, his Maje&s;ty looked upon S^r <HI>Marma|duke;</HI> who very chearfully &s;ubmitted to his Maje&s;tie's plea&s;ure; <Q>and &s;aid, &startq;he had only one Suit to make to his Maje&s;ty; which was that the&endq; Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> might command in Chief, and He under him.</Q> All who pre&s;ent, &s;tood amazed at what was now &s;aid; of which, no word had pa&s;&s;ed in Council; but when the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> as frankly accepted of the Command, they concluded, that it had been concerted before between the King, and the other Two.</P>
<P>NO Man contradicted any thing that had been propo&s;ed; and &s;o immediately, upon the place, a &s;hort Commi&s;&s;ion was prepar'd, and <MILESTONE N="20"> Sign'd by the King, to con&s;titute the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> Lieutenant General of all the Forces rai&s;ed, or to be rai&s;ed for the King on the other &s;ide of <HI>Trent;</HI> and with this Commi&s;&s;ion he immediately departed from the King, taking with him from the Rendezvous all the Northern Hor&s;e, with S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> and S^r <HI>Richard Hutton,</HI> High Sheriff of <HI>York-&s;hire,</HI> together with the Earls of <HI>Carnewarth,</HI> and <HI>Niddi&s;dale,</HI> and &s;everal other <HI>Scotch</HI> Gentlemen: he marched in the head of fifteen hun|dred Hor&s;e; and &s;o in a moment became a General, as well as a Secre|tary of State; and marched pre&s;ently to <HI>Doncaster.</HI></P>
<P>BECAUSE this Expedition was in a &s;hort time at an end, it will <MILESTONE N="30"> not be ami&s;s to fini&s;h the relation in this place; there being no occa|&s;ion to re&s;ume it hereafter. The Lord <HI>Digby</HI> was inform'd at his being at <HI>Doncaster,</HI> <Q>&startq;that there was, in a Town two or three miles di&s;tant, and little out of the way of the next days march, one thou&s;and Foo$&endq; newly rais'd for the Parliament;</Q> which he re&s;olv'd, the next Morning, to fall upon; and did it &s;o well, that they all threw down their Arms, and di&s;per&s;ed; whereupon he pro&s;ecuted his march to a Town called <HI>Sherborne,</HI> where he &s;tay'd to refre&s;h his Troops; and whil&s;t he &s;tayed there, he had notice of the advance of &s;ome Troops of Hor&s;e towards him, under the command of Colonel <HI>Copley: Digby</HI> pre&s;ently Sounded <MILESTONE N="40"> to Hor&s;e, and having gotten &s;ome few Troops ready, marched with them out of the Town; and finding <HI>Copley</HI> &s;tanding upon a convenient ground, he would not &s;tay for his other Companies, but immediately charg'd them with that Courage, that he routed mo&s;t of their Bodies; which, after a &s;hort re&s;i&s;tance, Fled, and were pur&s;ued by his Hor&s;e through <HI>Sherborne;</HI> where the other Troops were refre&s;hing them|&s;elves; who di&s;cerning the Flight of Hor&s;e, in great con&s;ternation, con|cluded, that they were their own Fellows, who had been Routed by the <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Digby <HI>routed at</HI> Sherborne <HI>in</HI> York-&s;hire.</NOTE> Enemy; and &s;o with equal confu&s;ion they mounted their Hor&s;es, and fled as fa&s;t as the other, &s;uch ways, as they &s;everally conceiv'd to be mo&s;t <MILESTONE N="50"> for their &s;afety. By this means, a Troop that remain'd upon the Field unbroken, fell upon the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> and tho&s;e Officers, and Gentle|men, who remain'd about him; who were compell'd to make their re|treat

to <HI>Skipton;</HI> which they did with the lo&s;s of S^r <HI>Richard Hutton</HI> (a gallant and worthy Gentleman, and the Son and Heir of a very ve|nerable Judge, a Man famous in his Generation) and two or three other per&s;ons; and with the lo&s;s of the Lord <HI>Digby</HI>'s Baggage; in which was his Cabinet of Papers; which, being publi&s;hed by the Parliament, ad|mini&s;tred afterwards &s;o much occa&s;ion of di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>AT <HI>Skipton,</HI> mo&s;t of the &s;cattered Troops came together again, with which he marched, without any other mi&s;adventures, through <HI>Cumber|land</HI> and <HI>Westmoreland,</HI> as far as <HI>Dumfreeze</HI> in <HI>Scotland;</HI> and then, neither receiving directions which way to march, nor where <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> was, and le&s;s knowing how to retire without falling into the hands of <MILESTONE N="10"> the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army upon the Borders; in the highe&s;t de&s;pair, that Lord, S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale,</HI> the two Earls, and mo&s;t of the other Offi|cers, embarked them&s;elves for the I&s;le of <HI>Man;</HI> and, &s;hortly after, for <HI>Ireland;</HI> where we &s;hall leave them, all the Troops being left by them, to &s;hift for them&s;elves. Thus tho&s;e fifteen hundred Hor&s;e which march|ed Northward, within very few days were brought to nothing; and the General&s;hip of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> to an end. But if it had not been for that extraordinary accident of the flying of his own Troops, becau&s;e the Enemy fled (as the greate&s;t misfortunes which befell that noble Per&s;on, <MILESTONE N="20"> throughout the whole cour&s;e of his life, u&s;ually fell out in a conjuncture when he had near attain'd to what he could wi&s;h) he had without doubt been Ma&s;ter of <HI>York,</HI> and of the whole North; the Parliament having no other Forces in all tho&s;e parts, their Garri&s;ons excepted, than tho&s;e Foot, which he fir&s;t defeated, and tho&s;e Hor&s;e which he had &s;o near broken. The temper, and compo&s;ition of his Mind was &s;o admi|rable, that he was allways more plea&s;ed and delighted that he had ad|vanced &s;o far, which he imputed to his own Virtue and Conduct, than broken or dejected that his Succe&s;s was not An&s;werable, which he &s;till charg'd upon &s;econd cau&s;es, for which he thought him&s;elf not account|able. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
<P>WHEN the Lord <HI>Digby</HI> and S^r <HI>Marmaduke Langdale</HI> left the King, his Maje&s;ty marched back to <HI>Newark</HI> with eight hundred Hor&s;e of his own Guards, and the Troops belonging to the Lord <HI>Gerrard;</HI> and quick|ly heard of the misfortune that befell the Northern Adventurers; upon which he concluded that it would not be &s;afe for him to &s;tay longer in the place where he was, for by this time <HI>Pointz</HI> was come with all his Troops to <HI>Nottingham,</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;&s;iter</HI> with all the Force of <HI>Lincoln-&s;hire</HI> to <HI>Grantham;</HI> and all the power his Maje&s;ty had, was not in any degree &s;trong enough to oppo&s;e either of them; &s;o that he was only <MILESTONE N="40"> to watch an opportunity by the Darkne&s;s of the Nights, and good Guides, to &s;teal from thence to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> or <HI>Oxford;</HI> in either of which he could only expect a little more time, and lei&s;ure to con&s;ider what was next to be done.</P>
<P>BUT before his Maje&s;ty can leave <HI>Newark,</HI> he mu&s;t undergo a new <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>An account of the Di&s;con|tents of &s;ome of his Chief Commanders again&s;t the King at</HI> New|ark.</NOTE> kind of mortification from his Friends, much &s;harper than any he had undergone from his Enemies; which, without doubt, he &s;uffered with much more grief, and perplexity of mind.

Order;</Q> and reprehended him <Q>&startq;for not having given obedience to his&endq; former Commands.</Q> Notwith&s;tanding this Command, he came the next day to <HI>Newark,</HI> and was met by the Lord <HI>Gerrard,</HI> and S^r <HI>Ri|chard Willis,</HI> Governour of the Town, with one hundred Hor&s;e, two miles in his way. About an hour after, with this Train, he came to the Court; and found the King in the pre&s;ence; and, without Ceremony, told his Maje&s;ty, <Q>&startq;that he was come to render an account of the lo&s;s of <HI>Bri&s;tol,</HI> and to clear him&s;elf from tho&s;e imputations which had been&endq; ca&s;t upon him.</Q> The King &s;aid very little to him; but, meat being brought up, went to Supper; and, during that time, asked &s;ome que|&s;tions <MILESTONE N="10"> of Prince <HI>Maurice,</HI> without &s;aying any thing to the other. After he had Supped, he retir'd to his Chamber, without admitting any far|ther di&s;cour&s;e; and the Prince return'd to the Governour's Hou&s;e, where he was well treated and lodged.

So that matter was &s;etled; upon which the King expected the Prince &s;hould have departed, as him&s;elf re&s;olv'd to pro&s;ecute the means for his own e&s;cape, without communicating it to him.</P>
<P>THE change of the po&s;ture of the Enemy, and <HI>Pointz</HI>'s coming to the North&s;ide of <HI>Trent,</HI> made his Maje&s;ty re&s;olve to begin his march <MILESTONE N="30"> on the Sunday-Night, being the twentieth of <HI>October;</HI> which he im|parted to none but two or three of the neare&s;t tru&s;t. But the differences were grown &s;o high between the Governour and the Commi&s;&s;ioners (who were all the principal Gentlemen of the Country, and Who had with Courage and Fidelity adher'd to the King from the beginning, and who&s;e intere&s;t alone had pre&s;erv'd that place) and had been &s;o much in|crea&s;ed by the mutual Conte&s;ts which had been between them in the pre|&s;ence of the King, that there was no po&s;&s;ibility of reconciling them, and very little of pre&s;erving the Garri&s;on, but by the removal of the Go|vernour; which was &s;o evident to the King, that he re&s;olv'd on that ex|pedient; <MILESTONE N="40"> and, on the Sunday Morning, &s;ent for S^r <HI>Richard Willis</HI> into his Bedchamber; <Q>and after many gracious expre&s;&s;ions of &startq;the Satisfaction he had receiv'd in his Service, and of the great abilities he had to Serve&endq; him,</Q> he told him, <Q>&startq;his own de&s;ign to be gone that Night; and that he re&s;olv'd to take him with him, and to make him Captain of his Hor&s;e Guards, in the place of the Earl of <HI>Lichfield,</HI> who had been lately&endq; kill'd before <HI>Che&s;ter</HI></Q> (which was a Command fit for any Subject) <Q>&startq;and that he would leave the Lord <HI>Bella&s;is</HI> Governour of <HI>Newark,</HI> who be|ing allied to mo&s;t of the Gentlemen of the adjacent Counties, and hav|ing&endq; a good E&s;tate there, would be more acceptable to them.</Q> His Ma|je&s;ty <MILESTONE N="50"> conde&s;cended &s;o far, <Q>as to tell him, &startq;that he did not hereby give a judgement on the Commi&s;&s;ioners &s;ide, who he declared, had been to blame in many particulars; and that he him&s;elf could not have an

ampler vindication, than by the honour and tru&s;t he now conferred upon him; but he found it would be much ea&s;ier to remove Him, than to reform the Commi&s;&s;ioners; who, being many, could not be any&endq; otherway united in his Service.</Q></P>
<P><Q>S^r <HI>Richard Willis</HI> appeared very much troubled; and excu&s;ed the not taking the other command, &startq;as a place of too great Honour, and that his Fortune could not maintain him in that employment; he &s;aid, that his Enemies would triumph at his removal, and he &s;hould be&endq; looked upon as ca&s;t out, and di&s;graced.</Q> <Q>The King replied, &startq;that he would take care, and provide for his Support; and that a man could <MILESTONE N="10"> not be looked upon as di&s;graced, who was placed &s;o near his Per&s;on; which, he told him, he would find to be true, when he had thought&endq; a little of it.</Q> So his Maje&s;ty went out of his Chamber, and pre&s;ently to the Church. When he return'd from thence, he &s;at down to dinner; the Lords, and other of his Servants, retiring likewi&s;e to their Lodgings. Before the King had din'd, S^r <HI>Richard Willis,</HI> with both the Princes, the Lord <HI>Gerrard,</HI> and about twenty Officers of the Garri&s;on, entred into the pre&s;ence Chamber: <HI>Willis</HI> addre&s;&s;ed him&s;elf to the King, and told him, <Q>&startq;that what his Maje&s;ty had &s;aid to him in private, was now the&endq; publick Talk of the Town,</Q> and very much to his Di&s;honour: Prince <MILESTONE N="20"> <HI>Rupert</HI> &s;aid, <Q>&startq;that S^r <HI>Richard Willis</HI> was to be remov'd from his Govern|ment, for no Fault that he had committed, but for being His Friend:&endq;</Q> the Lord <HI>Gerrard</HI> added, <Q>&startq;that it was the Plot of the Lord <HI>Digby,</HI> who&endq; was a Traytor, and he would prove him to be &s;o.</Q> The King was &s;o &s;urpri&s;ed with this manner of behaviour, that he ro&s;e in &s;ome di&s;or|der from the Table, and would have gone into his Bedchanber; <Q>calling S^r <HI>Richard Willis</HI> to follow him; who an&s;wered aloud, &startq;that he had re|ceiv'd a Publick injury, and therefore that he expected a Publick &s;ati&s;|faction.&endq;</Q> This, with what had pa&s;&s;ed before, So provoked his Maje&s;ty, that, with greater indignation than he was ever &s;een po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed with, he <MILESTONE N="30"> commanded them <Q>&startq;to depart from his Pre&s;ence, and to come no more&endq; into it;</Q> and this with &s;uch circum&s;tances in his looks and ge&s;ture, as well as words, that They appear'd no le&s;s confounded; and departed the room, a&s;ham'd of what they had done; yet a&s;&s;oon as they came to the Governours hou&s;e, they Sounded to Hor&s;e, intending to be pre&s;ent|ly gone.</P>
<P>THE noi&s;e of this unheard of in&s;olence, quickly brought the Lords who were ab&s;ent, and all the Gentlemen in the Town, to the King, with expre&s;&s;ions full of Duty, and a very tender &s;en&s;e of the u&s;age he had endured. There is no doubt, he could have proceeded in what <MILESTONE N="40"> manner he would again&s;t the Offenders. But his Maje&s;ty thought it be&s;t, on many con&s;iderations, to leave them to them&s;elves, and to be pu|ni&s;hed by their own reflections; and pre&s;ently declared the Lord <HI>Bel|la&s;is</HI> to be Governour; who immediately betook him&s;elf to his charge, and placed the Guards in &s;uch a manner as he thought rea&s;onable. In the afternoon, a Petition and Remon&s;trance was brought to the King, &s;ign'd by the two Princes, and about four and twenty Officers; in which they de&s;ired, <Q>&startq;that S^r <HI>Richard Willis</HI> might receive a Trial by a Court of War; and if they found him faulty, then to be di&s;mi&s;&s;ed from his charge; and that, if this might not be granted, they de&s;ired Pa&s;&s;es for&endq; <MILESTONE N="50"> them&s;elves, and as many Hor&s;e as de&s;ired to go with them.</Q> <Q>Withall, they &s;aid, &startq;they hoped, that his Maje&s;ty would not look upon this&endq; Action of theirs as a Mutiny.</Q> <Q>To the la&s;t, the King &s;aid, &startq;he would

not now Chri&s;ten it, but it looked very like one: As for the Court of War, he would not make that a judge of His Actions; but for the Pa&s;&s;es, they &s;hould be immediately prepared for as many as de&s;ired to&endq; have them.</Q> The next morning the Pa&s;&s;es were &s;ent to them; and in the afternoon they left the Town; being in all about two hundred Hor&s;e; and went to <HI>Wyverton,</HI> a &s;mall Garri&s;on depending upon <HI>Newark;</HI> where they &s;tayed &s;ome days; and from thence went to <HI>Belvoir-</HI>Ca&s;tle; <Q>from whence they &s;ent one of their Number to the Parliament, &startq;to de&s;ire&endq; leave, and Pa&s;&s;es, to go beyond the Seas.</Q></P>
<P>BESIDES the exceeding trouble and vexation that this Action of his <MILESTONE N="10"> Nephews, towards whom he had allways expre&s;&s;ed &s;uch tenderne&s;s and indulgence, gave the King, it had well nigh broke the de&s;ign he had for his pre&s;ent e&s;cape; which was not po&s;&s;ible to be executed in that time: and <HI>Pointz</HI> and <HI>Ro&s;&s;iter</HI> drew every day nearer, believing they had &s;o encompa&s;&s;ed him round, that it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to get out of their hands. They had now Be&s;ieged <HI>Shetford-</HI>Hou&s;e, a Garri&s;on belong|ing to <HI>Newark,</HI> and kept &s;trong Guards between that and <HI>Belvoir,</HI> and &s;tronger towards <HI>Lichfield;</HI> which was the way they mo&s;t &s;u&s;pected his Maje&s;ty would incline to take; &s;o that the truth is, nothing but Provi|dence could conduct him out of that Labyrinth; but the King gave not <MILESTONE N="20"> him&s;elf over.

another; that it was ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary, his Highne&s;s &s;hould con|&s;titute one Superior Officer, from whom all tho&s;e independent Officers might receive Orders; without which, it would not be po&s;&s;ible for that Army to be kept together, or do Service; that for His own part, he knew his Severity and Di&s;cipline had rendered him &s;o odious to the Lord <HI>Goring</HI>'s Hor&s;e, that they would &s;ooner choo&s;e to &s;erve the&endq; Enemy, than receive Orders from Him;</Q> therefore he de&s;ired his High|ne&s;s to con&s;titute <Q>&startq;the Earl of <HI>Brentford,</HI> or the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> to com|mand in Chief, and then he hoped, &s;ome good might be done again&s;t&endq; the Enemy.</Q> <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE mi&s;chief was more vi&s;ible by much than a remedy; it was evi|dent &s;ome Action mu&s;t be with the Enemy within few days, and what inconvenience would flow from any alteration, at &s;uch a conjuncture of time, was not hard to gue&s;s, when both Officer and Soldier were de&s;i|rous to take any occa&s;ion, and to find any excu&s;e to lay down their Armes; and it was plain, though there was very few who could do good, there were enough that could do hurt; be&s;ides, whoever was fit to un|dertake &s;o great a tru&s;t and charge, would be very hardly entreated to take upon him the Command of a di&s;&s;olute, undi&s;ciplin'd, wicked, beaten Army, upon which he mu&s;t engage his Honour, and the hope of what <MILESTONE N="20"> was left, without having time to reform, or in&s;truct them. That which made the re&s;olution nece&s;&s;ary, was, that though there was little hope of doing good by any alteration in Command, the$e was evident and demon&s;trable ruin attended No alteration; and they who were tru&s;ted might be accountable to the World, for not advi&s;ing the Prince to do that, which, how hopele&s;s &s;oever, only remain'd to be done.</P>

Of all the Train'd-bands of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> there were not three hundred left; and tho&s;e, by &s;ome infu&s;ions from <HI>Greenvil</HI> and others, not &s;o devoted to him as might have been expected. The re&s;t of the Foot (be&s;ides tho&s;e who belonged to the Lord <HI>Goring,</HI> which were two Regiments of about four hundred) were the three Regiments of about &s;ix hundred; which belong'd to S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> and the Officers <MILESTONE N="40"> of them entirely His Creatures; and tho&s;e belonging to General <HI>Digby,</HI> which were not above five hundred; To the&s;e were added (and were indeed the only Men, but a &s;mall Troop of his own of Hor&s;e and &s;ome Foot, upon who&s;e affection, courage, and duty he could Rely; except &s;ome particular Gentlemen, who could only undertake for them&s;elves) about two hundred and fifty Foot, and eight hundred Hor&s;e of the Guards; who were Commanded by the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> and entirely to re|ceive Orders from his Lord&s;hip.</P>
<P><Q>THE Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> very generou&s;ly told the Prince, &startq;that it was a cu&s;tom now, when Men were not willing to &s;ubmit to what they were <MILESTONE N="50"> enjoyn'd, to &s;ay, that it was again&s;t their Honour; that their Honour would not &s;uffer them to do this or that; for His part, he could not obey his Highne&s;s at this time, without re&s;olving to lo&s;e his Honour,

which he knew he mu&s;t, but &s;ince his Highne&s;s thought it nece&s;&s;ary to Command him, he was ready to obey him with the lo&s;s of his Ho|nour.&endq;</Q> Since the making of this Order was concluded an Act of ab&s;o|lute nece&s;&s;ity, and the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> had &s;o worthily Submitted to it, it was po&s;itively re&s;olv'd by his Highne&s;s, <Q>&startq;that it &s;hould be dutifully Submitted to by all other Men; or that the refu&s;ers &s;hould be exem|plarily&endq; puni&s;hed.</Q> There was not the lea&s;t &s;u&s;picion that S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> would not willingly have Submitted to it, but it was believ'd that the Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> who had carried him&s;elf &s;o high, and more in&s;olently &s;ince his di&s;orderly retreat than before, would have refus'd, <MILESTONE N="10"> which if he had done, it was re&s;olv'd by the Prince pre&s;ently to have committed him, and to have de&s;ired the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> to have taken the charge of the Hor&s;e.</P>
<P><Q>HIS Highne&s;s &s;ent S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> a Letter of thanks, &startq;for the advice which he had given; and which, he &s;aid, he had followed, as by the inclo&s;ed Order he might perceive; by which his Highne&s;s had committed the care and charge of the whole Army to the Lord <HI>Hop|ton,</HI> appointing that the Lord <HI>Wentworth</HI> &s;hould command all the Hor&s;e, and S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> all the Foot, and both to receive Or|ders&endq; from the Lord <HI>Hopton:</HI> no Man imagining it po&s;&s;ible that, be|&s;ides <MILESTONE N="20"> that he had given the advice,</Q> he could have refu&s;ed that Charge, by which he was to have a greater command than ever he had before, and was to be commanded by none but by whom he had often been formerly commanded. But the next day after he receiv'd that Letter and Order, contrary to all expectation, <Q>he writ to his Highne&s;s &startq;to de|&s;ire to be excu&s;ed, in re&s;pect of his indi&s;po&s;ition of health; expre&s;&s;ing, that he could do him better &s;ervice in getting up the Soldiers who&endq; &s;tragled in the Country, and in &s;uppre&s;&s;ing Malignants;</Q> and at the &s;ame time, <Q>writ to the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> &startq;that he could not con&s;ent to&endq; be commanded by the Lord <HI>Hopton.</HI></Q> It plainly appeared now, that <MILESTONE N="30"> his drift was to &s;tay behind, and Command <HI>Cornwal;</HI> with which, con|&s;idering the premi&s;es, the Prince thought he had no rea&s;on to tru&s;t him.

<P>WHAT &s;hould the Prince have done? for be&s;ides the ill con&s;equence of &s;uffering him&s;elf to be in that manner contemned, at a time when that Army was &s;o indi&s;po&s;ed, it was very evident, if <HI>Greenvil</HI> were at liberty, and the Army once marched out of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> he would have put him&s;elf in the head of all the di&s;contented Party, and at lea&s;t en|deavour'd to have hindred their retreat back into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> upon what occa&s;ion &s;oever; and for the pre&s;ent that he would under hand have kept many from marching with the Army, upon the &s;en&s;ele&s;s pretence of defending their own Country.

<P><Q>THE Lord <HI>Wentworth,</HI> though he &s;eem'd much &s;urpri&s;ed with the Order when he heard it read at the Board, and de&s;ired &startq;time to con|&s;ider&endq; of it till the next day, that he might confer with his Officers;</Q> yet, <Q>when the Prince told him, &startq;that he would not refer his Acts to be &s;canned by the Officers; but that he &s;hould give his po&s;itive An|&s;wer, whether he would &s;ubmit to it, or no; and then his Highne&s;s&endq; knew what he had to do;</Q> <Q>he only de&s;ired &startq;to con&s;ider till the Af|ternoon;&endq;</Q> when he &s;ubmitted; and went that Night out of Town to <MILESTONE N="10"> his Quarters; of which mo&s;t Men were not glad, but rather wi&s;hed (&s;ince they knew he would never obey chearfully) that he would have put the Prince to have made further alterations; which yet would have been accompanied with hazard enough. By this time the Intel|ligence was certain of the lo&s;s of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> which added neither courage, nor numbers to our Men; and the importunity was &s;uch from <HI>Exeter</HI> for pre&s;ent relief, that there &s;eem'd even a nece&s;&s;ity of attempting &s;omewhat towards it, upon how great di&s;advantage &s;oever; and therefore the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> re&s;olv'd to march by the way of <HI>Chim|ley;</HI> that &s;o, being between the Enemy and <HI>Barn&s;table,</HI> he might bor|row <MILESTONE N="20"> as many Men out of the Garri&s;on, as could be &s;pared; and by &s;trong Parties at lea&s;t to attempt upon their Quarters. <Q>But it was like|wi&s;e re&s;olv'd, &startq;that in re&s;pect of the &s;mallne&s;s of the numbers, and the general indi&s;po&s;ition, to &s;ay no wor&s;e, both in Officer and Sol|dier, it would not be fit for his Highne&s;s to venture his own Per&s;on&endq; with the Army; but that he &s;hould retire to <HI>Truro,</HI> and re&s;ide there;</Q> again&s;t which there were objections enough in view, which were how|ever weighed down by greater.</P>
<P>WHOEVER had ob&s;erv'd the temper of the Gentry of that County towards S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil,</HI> or the clamour of the common People <MILESTONE N="30"> again&s;t his oppre&s;&s;ion, and tyranny, would not have believ'd, that &s;uch a nece&s;&s;ary proceeding again&s;t him, at that time, could have been any Unpopular Act; there being &s;carce a day, in which &s;ome Petition was not pre&s;ented again&s;t him.

THERE were in the Goal at <HI>Launce&s;ton,</HI> at this time when him|&s;elf was committed, at lea&s;t thirty Per&s;ons, Con&s;tables and other Men, whom he had committed, and impo&s;ed Fines upon, &s;ome of three, four, and five hundred pounds, upon pretence of Delinquency (of which he was in no ca&s;e a proper judge) for the payment whereof they were detain'd in Pri&s;on.

<P>THE Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> having this Intelligence of the Strength, and <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Hopton<HI>'s Forces routed at</HI> Torrington <HI>by S^r</HI> Thomas Fairfax.</NOTE> Neighbourhood of the Enemy, had his election of two things, either <MILESTONE N="10"> to retire into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> or to abide them where he was; the fir&s;t, be|&s;ides the di&s;heartning of his Men, &s;eem'd rather a deferring, than a preventing of any mi&s;chief that could befall him; for he fore&s;aw, if he brought that great Body of Hor&s;e into <HI>Cornwal,</HI> the few that remain'd of the Train'd-bands, would immediately di&s;&s;olve, and run to their Hou&s;es; and the remainder of Hor&s;e and Foot, in a &s;hort time, be de&s;troyed without an Enemy. Therefore he rather cho&s;e, notwith&s;tand|ing the great di&s;advantage of Number in Foot, to abide them in that place; where, if the Enemy &s;hould attempt him in &s;o fa&s;t a Quarter, he might defend him&s;elf with more advantage, than he could in any <MILESTONE N="20"> other place. So he placed his Guards, and appointed all Men to their Po&s;ts, having drawn as many Hor&s;e (&s;uch as on the &s;uddain he could get) into the Town, as he thought nece&s;&s;ary; the re&s;t being Ordered to &s;tand on a Common, at the Ea&s;t end of the Town. But the Enemy forced the Barricado in one place by the ba&s;ene&s;s of the Foot; with which the Hor&s;e in the Town more ba&s;ely receiv'd &s;uch a Fright, that they could neither be made to charge, nor &s;tand; but, in perfect con|fu&s;ion, run away; who&s;e example all the Foot upon the Line, and at their other Po&s;ts, followed; leaving their General (who was hurt in the Face with a Pike, and his Hor&s;e kill'd under him) with two or three <MILESTONE N="30"> Gentlemen, to &s;hift for them&s;elves; one of the Officers publickly re|porting, le&s;t the Soldiers &s;hould not make ha&s;t enough in running away, <Q>&startq;&endq; that he &s;aw their General run through the Body with a Pike.</Q> The Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> recovering a fre&s;h Hor&s;e, was compell'd (being thus de|&s;erted by his Men) to retire; which he did, to the borders of <HI>Corn|wal;</HI> and &s;tay'd at <HI>Stratton</HI> two or three days, till about a thou&s;and or twelve hundred of his Foot came up to him. It was then in con|&s;ultation, &s;ince there was no likelyhood of making any &s;tand again&s;t the Enemy with &s;uch Foot, and that it was vi&s;ible that Body of Hor&s;e could not long Sub&s;i&s;t in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> whether the Hor&s;e might not break <MILESTONE N="40"> through to <HI>Oxford;</HI> which, in re&s;pect of their great wearyne&s;s, having &s;tood two or three days and nights in the Field, and the Enemies &s;trength being drawn up within two miles of them, was concluded to be impo&s;&s;ible. Be&s;ides (that there was at that time a confident a&s;|&s;urance, by an Expre&s;s (S^r <HI>D.

all the &s;trict Orders, very negligently performing their duty; in&s;omuch as the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> prote&s;ted, <Q>&startq;that, from the time he undertook the charge, to the hour of their di&s;&s;olving, &s;carce a par|ty or guard appeared with half the Number appointed, or within&endq; two hours of the time;</Q> and <HI>Goring</HI>'s Brigade, having the Guard up|on a Down near <HI>Bodmin,</HI> drew off without Orders, and without &s;end|ing out a Scout; in&s;omuch as the whole gro&s;s of the Rebels, were at day time marched within three miles, before the Foot in <HI>Bodmin</HI> had any Notice. So that the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> was in&s;tantly forced to draw off his Foot and Carriages We&s;tward; and kept the Field that <MILESTONE N="10"> cold Night, being the fir&s;t of <HI>March;</HI> but could not, by all his Or|ders diligently &s;ent out, draw any con&s;iderable Body of Hor&s;e to him by the end of the next day; they having quartered them&s;elves at plea&s;ure over the Country, many above twenty miles from <HI>Bod|min,</HI> and many running to the Enemy; and others purpo&s;ely &s;taying in their Quarters, till the Enemy came to di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s them.</P>
<P>WHEN, by the di&s;orders and di&s;tractions of the Army, which are before &s;et down, his Highne&s;s was per&s;waded to make his own Re&s;i|dence in <HI>Cornwal,</HI> he came to <HI>Truro</HI> on the 12^t^h day of <HI>February;</HI> where he received a Letter from the King, directed to tho&s;e four of <MILESTONE N="20"> the Council who had Signed that to his Maje&s;ty at <HI>Tavistock.</HI> This Letter was dated at <HI>Oxford</HI> the fifth of <HI>February,</HI> and contained the&s;e words;</P>
<P><Q>&startq;Yours from <HI>Tavi&s;tock</HI> hath fully &s;atisfied me, why my Commands concerning Prince <HI>Charles</HI> his going beyond Sea were not obeyed.

But withall, I reiterate my Com|mands to you for the Prince's going over, when&s;oever there &s;hall <MILESTONE N="30"> be a vi&s;ible hazard of his falling into the Rebels hands. In the mean time, I like very well that he &s;hould be at the head of the Army; and &s;o much the rather, for what I &s;hall now impart to you of my&endq; re&s;olution, <HI>&amp;c.</HI></Q> And &s;o proceeded in the comunication of his own de&s;ign of taking the Field; which was afterwards fru&s;trated by the defeat of my Lord <HI>Astley,</HI> and the ill &s;ucce&s;s in the We&s;t.</P>
<P>THE Prince having &s;tay'd &s;ome days at <HI>Truro,</HI> went to <HI>Penden|nis;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Prince goes to</HI> Pen|dennis.</NOTE> intending only to recreate him&s;elf for two or three days; and to quicken the Works, which were well advanced; his Highne&s;s hav|ing i&s;&s;ued all the Money he could procure, towards the fini&s;hing of <MILESTONE N="40"> them. But, in the very morning that he meant to return to <HI>Truro,</HI> his Army being then retired, and <HI>Fairfax</HI> at the edge of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> and the Lord <HI>Capel</HI> &s;ent adverti&s;ements, <Q>&startq;that they had &s;everally received Intelligence of a de&s;ign to &s;ei&s;e the Per|&s;on of the Prince; and that many Per&s;ons of Quality of the Coun|try&endq; were privy to it.</Q> Hereupon the Prince thought it mo&s;t con|venient to &s;tay where he was, and &s;o returned no more to <HI>Truro.</HI> The time of apparent danger was now in view, and if there were in truth any de&s;ign of &s;ei&s;ing the Prince's Per&s;on, they had rea&s;on to believe that &s;ome of his own Servants were not &s;trangers to it. The <MILESTONE N="50"> Lords <HI>Capel</HI> and <HI>Hopton</HI> being at the Army; only the Prince, the
<PB N="565" REF="6400">
Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> and the Chancellor of the Exchequer knew the King's plea&s;ure, and what was to be done. And they two had no confi|dence, that they &s;hould have reputation enough to go through with it; the Earl of <HI>Berk-&s;hire</HI> continuing very jealous of the de&s;ign of going into <HI>France,</HI> whatever they &s;aid to the contrary: the Gover|nour of the Ca&s;tle was Old and Fearful, and not re&s;olute enough to be tru&s;ted; and his Son, though a gallant Gentleman, and worthy of any Tru&s;t, had little credit with his Father.</P>
<P>THERE was no Letter from the King (though they had long before de&s;ired &s;uch a one, and propo&s;ed the Form) fit to be pub|lickly <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;hewed, in which there were not &s;ome clau&s;es which would have been apply'd to his Maje&s;ty's di&s;&s;ervice; e&s;pecially if he &s;hould have been at <HI>London,</HI> which was then confidently averred by &s;ome, who &s;wore <Q>&startq;&endq; they met him at <HI>Uxbridge.</HI></Q> Therefore the&s;e two Coun|&s;ellors concluded, <Q>&startq;that the Prince's going away mu&s;t &s;eem to be the effect of Coun&s;el upon nece&s;&s;ity, and the appearance of danger&endq; to his Per&s;on, without any mention of the King's command.</Q> But how to procure this Re&s;olution from the Council was the difficulty. They very well knew the Lords minds who were ab&s;ent, but dur&s;t not own that knowledge, le&s;t the de&s;ign might be more &s;u&s;pected: <MILESTONE N="20"> In the end, having advi&s;ed <HI>Baldwin Wake,</HI> to cau&s;e the Frigat be|longing to <HI>Ha&s;dunck,</HI> and the other Ships, to be ready upon an hours warning; they propo&s;ed in Council, when the Lords <HI>Berk-&s;hire,</HI> and <HI>Brentford</HI> were pre&s;ent, <Q>&startq;to &s;end M^r <HI>Fan&s;haw</HI> to the Army, to re|ceive opinion and advice of the Lords that were there, what was be&s;t to be done with reference to the Per&s;on of the Prince, and&endq; whether it were fit to hazard him in <HI>Pendennis;</HI></Q> which was ac|cordingly done. Their Lord&s;hips, according to the former agree|ment between them, return'd their advice, <Q>&startq;that it was not fit to adventure his Highne&s;s in that Ca&s;tle (which would not only not <MILESTONE N="30"> pre&s;erve his Per&s;on, but probably, by his &s;tay there, might be lo&s;t; but by his ab&s;ence might defend it &s;elf) and that he &s;hould remove&endq; to <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> or <HI>Silly.</HI></Q> This, upon M^r <HI>Fan&s;haw</HI>'s report, was unanimou&s;|ly con&s;ented to by the whole Council.</P>
<P>BUT becau&s;e <HI>Jer&s;ey</HI> was &s;o near to <HI>France,</HI> and &s;o might give the greater umbrage, and that <HI>Silly</HI> was a part of <HI>Cornwal,</HI> and was by them all conceiv'd a place of unque&s;tionable &s;trength, the publick re&s;olution was for <HI>Silly,</HI> it being in their power, when they were at Sea, to go for <HI>Jer&s;ey,</HI> if the Wind was fair for one, and cro&s;s to the other. So the re&s;olution being imparted to no more that Night, <MILESTONE N="40"> than was of ab&s;olute nece&s;&s;ity (for we apprehended clamour from the Army, from the Country, and from that Garri&s;on in who&s;e Power the Prince was) the next Morning, being <HI>Monday,</HI> the &s;econd of <HI>March,</HI> after the News was come that the Army was retiring from <HI>Bodmin,</HI> and the Enemy marching furiou&s;ly after, and thereby Men were &s;ufficiently awaken'd with the apprehen&s;ion of the Prince's Safety; the Governour and his Son were call'd into the Council, and made acquainted with the Prince's re&s;olution, <Q>&startq;that Night to em|bark him&s;elf for <HI>Silly,</HI> being a part of <HI>Cornwal;</HI> from whence, by &s;uch aids and relief, as he hoped he &s;hould procure from <HI>France&endq;</HI> <MILESTONE N="50"> and Forreign parts, he &s;hould be be&s;t able to relieve them.</Q> And accordingly, that Night, about ten of the Clock, he put him&s;elf on

Board; and on <HI>Wedne&s;day</HI> in the afternoon, arrived &s;afe in <HI>Silly;</HI> <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Thence by Sea to</HI> Silly.</NOTE> from whence, within two days, the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> was &s;ent into <HI>France,</HI> <Q>to acquaint the Queen &startq;with his Highne&s;s's being at <HI>Silly,</HI> with the Wants and Incommodities of that place; and to de&s;ire &s;up|ply of Men and Monies for the Defence thereof, and the Support&endq; of his own Per&s;on;</Q> it being agreed in Council, before the Lord <Q><HI>Colepepper</HI>'s going from <HI>Silly,</HI> &startq;that if, upon advancement of the Par|liament Fleet, or any other apparent danger, his Highne&s;s &s;hould&endq; have cau&s;e to &s;u&s;pect the &s;ecurity of his Per&s;on there</Q> (the Strength of the place in no degree an&s;wering expectation, or the fame of it) <MILESTONE N="10"> <Q>&startq;&endq; he would immediately embark him&s;elf in the &s;ame Frigat</Q> (which attended there) <Q>&startq;&endq; and go to <HI>Jer&s;ey.</HI></Q></P>
<P>WHEN the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> found that he could put no re&s;traint to the Licence of the Soldiers, he called a Council of War to con&s;ider what was to be done. The principal Officers of Hor&s;e were &s;o far from con&s;idering any Means to put their Men in order, and heart to face the Enemy, that they declared, <Q>in plain Engli&s;h, &startq;that their&endq; Men would never be brought to Fight;</Q> <Q>and therefore propo&s;ed po|&s;itively, &startq;&endq; to &s;end for a Treaty: From which not one Officer di&s;&s;ent|ed, except only Major General <HI>Web,</HI> who allways profe&s;&s;ed again&s;t <MILESTONE N="20"> it.</Q> <Q>The Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> told them, &startq;it was a thing he could not con|&s;ent to without expre&s;s leave from the Prince (who was then at <HI>Pen|dennis-</HI>Ca&s;tle) to whom he would immediately di&s;patch away an Ex|pre&s;s;&endq; hoping, that, by that delay, he &s;hould be able to recover the Officers to a better re&s;olution;</Q> or that, by the advance of the Ene|my, they would be compelled to Fight. But they continued their im|portunity, and at la&s;t (no doubt by the advice of our own Men; for many, both Officers and Soldiers, went every day in to them) a Trum|pet arrived from S^r <HI>Thomas Fairfax</HI> with a Letter to the Lord <HI>Hop|ton,</HI> offering a Treaty, and making &s;ome Propo&s;itions to the Officers <MILESTONE N="30"> and Soldiers. His Lord&s;hip communicated not this Letter to above one or two, of principal tru&s;t; conceiving it not fit, in that di&s;order and dejectedne&s;s, to make it publick. Hereupon, all the principal Officers a&s;&s;emble together (except the Major General, <HI>Web)</HI> <Q>and ex|pre&s;&s;ing much di&s;content that they might not &s;ee the Letter, declare peremptorily to the Lord <HI>Hopton,</HI> &startq;that if he would not con&s;ent to&endq; it, they were re&s;olv'd to treat Them&s;elves.</Q> And from this time they neither kept Guards, nor perform'd any Duty; Their Hor&s;e every day mingling with tho&s;e of the Enemy, without any Act of Ho&s;tility. In this &s;treight, the Lord <HI>Hopton</HI> having &s;ent his Ammunition and Foot <MILESTONE N="40"> into <HI>Pendennis,</HI> and the Mount, and declared, <Q>&startq;that he would neither&endq; Treat for him&s;elf nor the Garri&s;ons, he gave the Hor&s;e leave to Treat;</Q> and thereupon tho&s;e Articles were concluded, by which that Body of Hor&s;e was di&s;&s;olv'd; and Him&s;elf and the Lord <HI>Capel,</HI> with the fir&s;t <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The Lord</HI> Hopton<HI>'s Ar|my di&s;&s;olv'd.</HI></NOTE> Wind, went from the Mount to <HI>Silly,</HI> to attend his Highne&s;s; who, as is &s;aid, was gone thither from <HI>Pendennis-</HI>Ca&s;tle, after the Enemies whole Army was enter'd <HI>Cornwal.</HI></P>

Without doubt, what he Did afterwards, and what he Suffered, ought, in great mea&s;ure, to free his Memory from any reproaches for the errours, or weakne&s;s, of which he had before been guilty. What were the mo|tives, and inducements of his commitment, have been at large &s;et down before in the proper place. It remains now, only to &s;et down <MILESTONE N="20"> how he came at la&s;t to be po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ed of his Liberty, and why he ob|tain'd it no &s;ooner, by other more gracious ways from the King; which might have been an obligation upon him; when it might ea&s;ily have been fore&s;een, that he mu&s;t be, in a &s;hort time, at liberty, notwith|&s;tanding any oppo&s;ition.</P>
<P>WHEN the Prince fir&s;t vi&s;ited <HI>Cornwal,</HI> to &s;ettle his own Revenue of that Dutchy; which was the only &s;upport he had, and out of which he provided for the carrying on the King's Service, upon many emer|gent occa&s;ions; he &s;pent &s;ome days at <HI>Truro,</HI> to &s;ettle his duty upon the Tinn, by Virtue of his ancient Priviledge of Preemption. And in that <MILESTONE N="30"> time, which was about the end of <HI>July,</HI> the Governour of <HI>Penden|nis-</HI>Ca&s;tle invited him to dine there; which his Highne&s;s willingly ac|cepted, that he might take a full View of the &s;ituation and &s;trength thereof; having it then in his view, that he might probably be com|pelled to re&s;ort thither. Every Man knew well that Duke <HI>Hamilton</HI> was then a Pri&s;oner there, and therefore it was to be con&s;ider'd, what the Prince was to do, if the Duke &s;hould de&s;ire, as without doubt he would, to ki&s;s his hand. <Q>And it was re&s;olv'd without di&s;pute, &startq;that the Prince was not to admit &s;uch a Per&s;on into his Pre&s;ence, who &s;tood &s;o much in his Fathers di&s;plea&s;ure, and was committed to Pri|&s;on <MILESTONE N="40"> by him; and that none of the Council, or of his Highne&s;s's Ser|vants, &s;hould vi&s;it, or enter into any kind of corre&s;pondence with&endq; him.</Q> <Q>Thereupon the Governour was advi&s;ed, in regard the accom|modations in the Ca&s;tle, were very narrow, &startq;that, during the time the Prince was in the Ca&s;tle, the Duke &s;hould be removed out of his&endq; Chamber into one of the Soldier's Hou&s;es;</Q> which was done accord|ingly. <Q>This the Duke took very heavily, lamenting &startq;that he might&endq; not be admitted to &s;ee the Prince;</Q> and had a de&s;ire to have con|ferred with the Lord <HI>Colepepper,</HI> or the Chancellor, which they were not then at liberty to have &s;atisfied him in. He afterwards renewed <MILESTONE N="50"> the &s;ame de&s;ire to them both, by his Servant M^r <HI>Hamilton.</HI> Here|upon, when the Chancellor was &s;hortly after &s;ent to vi&s;it the Ports of

<P><Q>WHEN the Duke, after &s;ome civilities to him whom he had long known, and &s;ome reproaches to the Governour, who was pre&s;ent, &startq;of his very &s;trict u&s;age and carriage towards him; which, he &s;aid he&endq; believ'd he could not ju&s;tify</Q> (whereas the Chancellor well knew, that the Governour was ab&s;olutely govern'd by him) <Q>&s;poke to him of <MILESTONE N="20"> his own condition, and of &startq;his misfortune to fall into his Maje&s;ties di&s;plea&s;ure, without having given him any offence. He told him, that he had very much de&s;ired to &s;peak with him, that he might make a Propo&s;ition to him, which he thought for the King's Service; and he de&s;ired, if it &s;eem'd &s;o to Him, that he would find means to&endq; recommend it to his Maje&s;ty, and to procure his acceptance of it.</Q> <Q>Then he told him, &startq;that he was an ab&s;olute Stranger to the Affairs of both Kingdoms, having no other Intelligence, than what he re|ceiv'd from Gentlemen whom he met in the next Room at Dinner; but he believ'd, by his Maje&s;ties late lo&s;s at <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> that his condi|tion <MILESTONE N="30"> in <HI>England</HI> was very much wor&s;e than his Servants hoped it would have been; and therefore, that it might concern him to tran&s;|act his bu&s;ine&s;s in <HI>Scotland</HI> a&s;&s;oon as might be: that he knew not in what &s;tate the Lord <HI>Mountro&s;e</HI> was in that Kingdom, but he was&endq; per&s;waded that he was not without oppo&s;ition.</Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he was confident that if he him&s;elf had his liberty, he could do the King con&s;iderable Service, and either incline that Nation powerfully to mediate a Peace in <HI>England,</HI> or po&s;itively to declare for the King,&endq; and joyn with <HI>Mountro&s;e.</HI></Q> <Q>He &s;aid, &startq;he knew, it was believ'd by many, that the animo&s;ity was &s;o great from him to <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> who <MILESTONE N="40"> indeed had done him very cau&s;ele&s;s injuries, that he would rather meditate revenge than concur with him in any Action; but, he &s;aid, he too well under&s;tood his own danger, if the King and Monarchy were de&s;troyed in this Kingdom, to think of private contention and matters of revenge, when the Publick was &s;o much at Stake.

and would engage his Honour, that if he found he could not be able to do his Maje&s;ty that acceptable Service, which he de&s;ired (of which he had not the lea&s;t doubt) he would &s;peedily return, and render&endq; him&s;elf a Pri&s;oner again in the place where he then was.</Q> In this di&s;cour&s;e he made very great profe&s;&s;ions, and expre&s;&s;ions of his De|votion to the King's Service, of his obligations to him, and of the great confidence he had in this particular, of being u&s;eful to his Ma|je&s;ty.</P>
<P><Q>AFTER he made &s;ome pau&s;e, in expectation of what the Chancel|lor would &s;ay, the Chancellor told him, he doubted not but he was <MILESTONE N="10"> &startq;very able to &s;erve the King both in that and in this Kingdom; there being very many in both who had a principal dependence upon him: that he heard the King was making &s;ome Propo&s;itions to the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army in <HI>England,</HI> and that it would be a great in&s;tance of his Affe|ction and Fidelity to the King, if by any Me&s;&s;age from him to his Friends, and Dependents in the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army then before <HI>Hereford,</HI> or to his Friends in <HI>Scotland,</HI> his Brother being the head or prime Per&s;on of Power there that oppo&s;ed <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> they &s;hould declare for the King, or appear willing to do him Service; and that he having free liberty to &s;end, through the Parliament's Army, to <HI>London,</HI> or <MILESTONE N="20"> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> he might a&s;&s;oon do the King this Service, as receive a Warrant for his enlargement; which, he pre&s;umed, he knew could&endq; not be granted but by the King him&s;elf.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE Duke replied, &startq;that he expected that An&s;wer, but that it was not po&s;&s;ible for him to do any thing by Me&s;&s;age or Letter, or any way but by his Pre&s;ence: Fir&s;t, that they, in whom he had intere&s;t, would look upon any thing he &s;hould write, or any Me&s;&s;age he &s;hould &s;end, as the re&s;ult of di&s;tre&s;s and compul&s;ion, not of his af|fection or judgement. Be&s;ides, he &s;aid, he looked upon him&s;elf as very odious to that Nation, which was irreconciled to him for his <MILESTONE N="30"> zeal to the King, and thought this a ju&s;t judgement of God upon him for not adhering to them. And, he &s;aid, for his own Brother, who he heard indeed had the greate&s;t influence upon their Coun&s;els, he had no rea&s;on to be confident in him, at that di&s;tance; for, be|&s;ides the extreme injury he had done him, in making an e&s;cape from <HI>Oxford,</HI> by which both their innocencies were made to be &s;u&s;pected, and for which he &s;hould never forgive him, he was the Heir of the Hou&s;e and Family; and he believ'd, would be content that him&s;elf &s;hould grow old and dye in Pri&s;on: whereas, if he were at liberty, and among&s;t them, he was confident &s;ome for love, and others for <MILESTONE N="40"> fear, would &s;tick to him; and he &s;hould ea&s;ily make it appear to tho&s;e who were fierce&s;t again&s;t the King, that it concern'd their own&endq; intere&s;t to &s;upport the King in his ju&s;t power.</Q> <Q>However, he con|cluded, &startq;that the wor&s;t that could come was his returning to Pri|&s;on,&endq; which he would not fail to do.</Q> So the di&s;cour&s;e ended for that Night.</P>
<P>THE next day the Duke enter'd again into the &s;ame Argument, with much earne&s;tne&s;s, that the Chancellor would interpo&s;e, upon that ground, for his liberty; <Q>who told him, &startq;that he was &s;o ill a Courtier, that he could not di&s;&s;emble to him: that he was not &s;atisfied with his Rea|&s;ons; <MILESTONE N="50"> and could not but believe, he had intere&s;t enough, at that di|&s;tance, to make &s;ome real demon&s;tration of his Affection to the King,
<PB N="570" REF="6450">
by the impre&s;&s;ion he might make upon his Dependents, and Allies: and therefore that he could not offer any advice to the King, to the&endq; purpo&s;e he de&s;ired.</Q> <Q>He told him, &startq;that he had been pre&s;ent at the Council Table when the King communicated that bu&s;ine&s;s, which concern'd him, to the Board; and that he gave his opinion fully, and earne&s;tly, for his commitment; being &s;atisfied, upon the information that was given concerning him, that his Affection to the King was very que&s;tionable; and that it appear'd, that he had been earne&s;tly pre&s;&s;ed by tho&s;e Per&s;ons of Honour in that Kingdom, upon whom his Maje&s;ty relied, to declare him&s;elf; and that if he could have been <MILESTONE N="10"> induced &s;o to do, having promi&s;ed the King he would, and having Authority to that purpo&s;e from him, they might very ea&s;ily have &s;uppre&s;&s;ed that Rebellion in the bud: but that his Lord&s;hip and his Brother, were &s;o far from oppo&s;ing it, that the very Proclamation which had i&s;&s;ued out there for the general In&s;urrection (which Pro|clamation was peru&s;ed at Council Table, when he was committed) was not only &s;et forth in his Maje&s;ties own Name, but Sealed with his Signet; which was then in the Cu&s;tody of the Earl of <HI>Lanrick</HI> his Brother, he being Secretary of State in that Kingdom. That tho&s;e who were the principal Informers again&s;t him, and who profe&s;&s;ed <MILESTONE N="20"> that they could do no Service, if he were at liberty, now &s;ince his re|&s;traint, being armed with no more Authority than he had, at his la&s;t being there, when the Kingdom was in Peace, had, upon all di&s;ad|vantages imaginable, when that Kingdom was totally lo&s;t to the King, reduced the greate&s;t part of it again to his obedience: and therefore, whether it was his Lord&s;hip's Misfortune, or his Fault, &s;ince things pro&s;per'd &s;o well in his ab&s;ence, he could not, as a Coun&s;ellor, advi&s;e the King, without the privity and con&s;ent of the Lord <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> or without &s;ome &s;uch Te&s;timony of his Service, as he had before pro|po&s;ed, to give him his Liberty: and that any ill &s;ucce&s;s, which po&s;|&s;ibly <MILESTONE N="30"> might have no relation to that Act, would yet be imputed to that Coun&s;el; and the Lord <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> have at lea&s;t a ju&s;t, or pro|bable&endq; excu&s;e, for any thing that &s;hould happen ami&s;s.</Q></P>
<P><Q>THE Duke thanked him for the freedom he had u&s;ed towards him; and &s;aid, &startq;upon the information which was given again&s;t him, he mu&s;t acknowledge the proceedings to be very ju&s;t; but he was confident, whenever he &s;hould be admitted to a fair hearing, he &s;hould appear very innocent from the Allegations which had been given. He &s;aid, he had never made the lea&s;t promi&s;e to the King, which he had not exactly perform'd; that he had not Authority or Power to cro&s;s any <MILESTONE N="40"> thing that was done to the prejudice of the King; and therefore to have made any &s;uch Attempt, or Declaration, as &s;ome Lords had de|&s;ired, in that conjuncture of time, had been to have de&s;troyed them|&s;elves to no purpo&s;e: and therefore, he made ha&s;t to the King with &s;uch Propo&s;itions, and Overtures, that he was confident, if he had been admitted to have &s;poken with his Maje&s;ty, at his coming to <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> he &s;hould have given good &s;atisfaction in them; and then in|tended immediately to have return'd into <HI>Scotland,</HI> with &s;uch au|thority and countenance, as the King could well have given him; and doubted not but to have prevented any inconveniences from <MILESTONE N="50"> that Kingdom: but that by his Impri&s;onment (which he could have prevented, for he had notice upon his Journey, what was intended,
<PB N="571" REF="6460">
and tru&s;ted &s;o much in his innocence, that he would not avoid it) all tho&s;e de&s;igns failed. For his Brother, he could &s;ay nothing; but he believ'd him an hone&s;t Man; and for the proceedings of the Lord <HI>Mountro&s;e,</HI> though he had receiv'd good a&s;&s;i&s;tance from <HI>Ireland,</HI> which was a good foundation, he could not but &s;ay, it had been lit|tle le&s;s than miraculous: However, he pre&s;umed the work was not&endq; &s;o near done there, but that His A&s;&s;i&s;tance might be very &s;ea&s;onable.</Q> After this they &s;poken often together; but this was the &s;ub&s;tance and re&s;ult of all; he in&s;i&s;ting upon his pre&s;ent liberty, and the other as pre&s;&s;ing, that he would write to his Friends. <Q>Yet the Chancellor pro|mi&s;ed <MILESTONE N="10"> him &startq;to pre&s;ent, by the fir&s;t convenience, his Suit and Propo|&s;ition&endq; to the King; which he &s;hortly after did in a Letter to the Lord <HI>Digby.</HI></Q></P>
<P>UPON the fir&s;t news of the lo&s;s of the Battle of <HI>Na&s;eby,</HI> it was enough fore&s;een, that the Prince him&s;elf might be put to a retreat to <HI>Pendennis-</HI>Ca&s;tle. <Q>Therefore they wi&s;hed, &startq;that it might be in the Prince's power, upon an emergent occa&s;ion, to remove the Duke from&endq; that place.</Q> Which con&s;ideration the Lord <HI>Colepepper</HI> pre&s;ented to the King, at his being with him in <HI>Wales;</HI> and thereupon a Warrant was &s;ent from the King, for the removal of the Duke to <HI>Silly;</HI> which <MILESTONE N="20"> was likewi&s;e fore&s;een that the Prince might repair to. As the Enemy drew nearer the We&s;t, many good Men were very &s;ollicitous, that the Duke &s;hould be removed from <HI>Pendennis,</HI> having a great jealou&s;y of the intere&s;t he had in the Governour; of which there was &s;o univer|&s;al a &s;u&s;picion, <Q>that many Letters were writ to the Council, &startq;that if he were not &s;peedily di&s;po&s;ed to &s;ome other place, they feared the&endq; Ca&s;tle would be betrayed: and S^r <HI>Richard Greenvil</HI> writ earne&s;tly to the Prince about it, as did S^r <HI>Harry Killigrew</HI></Q> (a Per&s;on of entire Affections to the King, and a true Friend of the Governour) very im|portunately. So that about the Month of <HI>November,</HI> the King's War|rant <MILESTONE N="30"> for his removal was &s;ent to S^r <HI>Arthur Ba&s;&s;et</HI> Governour of the Mount; who went to <HI>Pendennis</HI> in the Morning, and took him with him to the Mount, in order to remove him to <HI>Silly,</HI> when the time <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>Duke</HI> Hamil|ton <HI>is remov'd to the Mount.</HI></NOTE> &s;hould require it; the Duke expre&s;&s;ing great trouble and di&s;content that he &s;hould be removed, and pretending, <Q>&startq;that he could not ride&endq; for the Stone</Q> (of which he complain'd &s;o much, that he had Peti|tion'd the King for leave to go into <HI>France</HI> to be cut) and the Go|vernour, and all that Family and Garri&s;on, made &s;hew of no le&s;s grief to part with him, he having begotten a great opinion in that People of his integrity and innocence. But when the Duke &s;aw there was no <MILESTONE N="40"> Remedy, he mounted a Hor&s;e that was provided for him, and pa&s;&s;ed the Journey very well.</P>
<P>AFTER the lo&s;s of <HI>Dartmouth,</HI> &s;ome Per&s;ons of near tru&s;t about the Prince re&s;umed the di&s;cour&s;e again of enlarging the Duke, and believ'd that he would be able to do the King great Service in the bu&s;ine&s;s of <HI>Scotland;</HI> and this prevailed &s;o far with one of the Lords of the Council, that, upon the confidence of D^r <HI>Frazier,</HI> the Prince's Phy&s;ician, he made a Journey with the D^r to the Mount; <Q>and did think, that he had &s;o much prevailed with the Duke, that he had con&s;ented &startq;to &s;end a Servant &s;peedily to the <HI>Scoth</HI> Army in <HI>England</HI> (who &s;hould <MILESTONE N="50"> likewi&s;e pa&s;s by the King, and carry any Letters to his Maje&s;ty from the Prince) to per&s;wade them to comply with the King; and
<PB N="572" REF="6470">
that he would likewi&s;e di&s;ptch <HI>Charles Murry</HI> into <HI>Scotland,</HI> in|&s;tructed to his Brother <HI>Lanrick,</HI> and that Party, to oblige them to joyne with <HI>Mountro&s;e.</HI> But D^r <HI>Frazier</HI> confe&s;&s;ed to tho&s;e he tru&s;ted, that the Duke rather con&s;ented to it to &s;atisfy that Lord's vehe|mence and importunity, than that he had any great hope of &s;ucce&s;s&endq; by it;</Q> in&s;i&s;ting &s;till, that nothing but his own Liberty would do it: for which he gave a rea&s;on, that before had never been heard of, and was very contrary to what the Duke had &s;aid to the Chancellor, <Q>which was, &startq;that the State of <HI>Scotland</HI> was &s;o &s;en&s;ible of the injury done&endq; to the Duke by his impri&s;onment</Q> (which he had &s;aid before that they were very glad of) <Q>&startq;that they had made an Order, that there <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;hould never be Treaty with the King, or agreeing with <HI>Mountro&s;e,&endq;</HI> till he was at Liberty, or brought to a legal Trial.</Q> And when <HI>Charles Murry</HI> went to him for his in&s;tructions, though he &s;aid much for him to &s;ay again to his Friends, and his Brother, towards their declaring for the King, he di&s;couraged him much as to the Journey, repre&s;ent|ing to him <Q>&startq;his own danger, and the &s;trict Orders that were in <HI>Scot|land</HI> again&s;t divi&s;ive Motions; of which, he &s;aid, he feared this would&endq; be taken for one.</Q></P>
<P>THIS made the Council to have no mind to be engaged in any <MILESTONE N="20"> Treaty with him, and le&s;s in propo&s;ing or con&s;enting to his liberty; not only upon the former knowledge they had of his di&s;po&s;ition and nature, but al&s;o that they believ'd, if he were not &s;incere, he would do much mi&s;chief; and the more for being in any degree tru&s;ted; if he were &s;incere, that he would be able to do more good for the King, by being redeem'd out of Pri&s;on by the Enemy, than by be|ing relea&s;ed by the King or Prince. And therefore, when the Prince remov'd in that ha&s;t and di&s;order from <HI>Pendennis</HI> to <HI>Silly,</HI> there was no po&s;&s;ibility of removing him; &s;o that, at the &s;urrender of the <NOTE PLACE="marg">Upon the Sur|render of the Mount he ob|tain'd his Li|berty.</NOTE> Mount, which was, by his advice, much &s;ooner than they had rea|&s;on <MILESTONE N="30"> to do it, when they were able to defend them&s;elves for many Months, he was enlarged, and remov'd him&s;elf to <HI>London</HI> by &s;peedy Journeys on Hor&s;e-back; and did never after complain of the Stone; <Q>which he before prote&s;ted &startq;would kill him, if he were not cut with|in&endq; a year.</Q></P>
<P>WE left the King in <HI>Oxford,</HI> free from the trouble and unea&s;i|ne&s;s <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The King</HI>'s <HI>tran&s;actions at</HI> Oxford.</NOTE> of tho&s;e perpetual and wandering Marches, in which he had been &s;o many Months exerci&s;ed; and quiet from all rude and in&s;o|lent provocations. He was now among&s;t his true and faithful Councel|lors and Servants, who&s;e Affection and Loyalty had fir&s;t engaged <MILESTONE N="40"> them in his Service, and made them &s;tick to him to the end; and who, if they were not able to give him a&s;&s;i&s;tance, to &s;tem that mighty torrent that overbore both Him and Them, paid him &s;till the Duty that was due to him, and gave him no vexation when they could not give him comfort. There were yet &s;ome Garri&s;ons remaining in his obedience, which were like, during the winter Sea&s;on, to be pre|&s;erv'd from any attempt of the Enemy. But upon the approach of Spring, if the King &s;hould be without an Army in the Field, the fate of tho&s;e few places was ea&s;ie to be di&s;cern'd. And which way an Army could po&s;&s;ibly be brought together, or where it &s;hould be rai&s;ed, was <MILESTONE N="50"> not within the compa&s;s of the wi&s;e&s;t Man's comprehen&s;ion. However, the more difficult it was, the more vigour was to be applied in the
<PB REF="6480">

<PB N="573" REF="6490">
attempt. <HI>Worcester,</HI> as it was Neighbouring to <HI>Wales,</HI> had the great|e&s;t outlet and elbow-room; and the Parliament party that had gotten any footing there, behaved them&s;elves with that in&s;olence and Ty|ranny, that even they who had called them thither, were weary of them, and ready to enter into any combination to de&s;troy them. Up|on this pro&s;pect, and &s;ome invitation, the King &s;ent the Lord <HI>A&s;tley</HI> (whom he had before, at his being at <HI>Cardiff,</HI> con&s;tituted Governour of tho&s;e parts, in the place of the Lord <HI>Gerrard)</HI> <Q>to <HI>Worce&s;ter,</HI> with order &startq;to proceed, as he &s;hould find him&s;elf able, towards the ga|thering a Body of Hor&s;e together, again&s;t the Spring, from tho&s;e&endq; <MILESTONE N="10"> Garri&s;ons which were left, and from <HI>Wales:</HI> and what progre&s;s he made towards it will be &s;oon known.</Q></P>
<P>WHEN a full pro&s;pect, upon the mo&s;t mature deliberation, was taken of all the hopes which might with any colour of rea&s;on be en|tertain'd; all that occurred, appeared &s;o hopele&s;s and de&s;perate, that it was thought fit to re&s;ort to an old expedient, that had been found as de|&s;perate as any; which was a new Overture for a Treaty of Peace: for which, they who advi&s;ed it, had no other rea&s;on, but that they could not tell what el&s;e to do. <HI>Cromwel</HI> had left <HI>Fairfax</HI> in the We&s;t, and with a party Selected had &s;et down before <HI>Ba&s;ing,</HI> and his im|perious <MILESTONE N="20"> <NOTE PLACE="marg">Cromwel <HI>takes</HI> Win|che&s;ter <HI>und</HI> Ba&s;ing.</NOTE> Summons having been rejected, he Storm'd the Place and took it, and put mo&s;t of the Garri&s;on to the Sword: and a little be|fore <HI>Winche&s;ter</HI> had &s;urrendered upon ea&s;y conditions. The le&s;&s;er Gar|ri&s;ons in the North, which had &s;tood out till now, were render'd every day; and the <HI>Scotch</HI> Army, which had marched as far as their own Borders, was called back, and required to be&s;iege <HI>Newark.</HI> So that whoever thought the &s;ending to the Parliament (puffed up and &s;woln with &s;o many Succe&s;&s;es) for a Peace, would prove to no purpo&s;e, was not yet able to tell, what was like to prove to better purpo&s;e. This reflection alone prevail'd with the King, who had enough experiment|ed <MILESTONE N="30"> tho&s;e inclinations, <Q>to refer entirely to the Council, &startq;to choo&s;e any expedient, they thought mo&s;t probable to &s;ucceed, and to prepare any me&s;&s;age they would advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty to &s;end to the Parlia|ment.&endq;</Q> And when they had con&s;idered it, the Overtures he had al|ready made, by two &s;everal Me&s;&s;ages, to which he had received no An&s;wer, were &s;o ample, that they knew not what addition to make to them; but concluded, <Q>&startq;that this Me&s;&s;age &s;hould contain nothing but a re&s;entment of That, and a demand of an An&s;wer to the Me&s;|&s;ages&endq; his Maje&s;ty had formerly &s;ent for a Treaty of Peace.</Q></P>
<P>THIS Me&s;&s;age had the &s;ame entertainment which the former had <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King &s;ends another Me&s;&s;age for Peace; which was laid a&s;ide by the Hou&s;es.</NOTE> <MILESTONE N="40"> receiv'd. It was receiv'd, read, and then laid a&s;ide without any de|bate; which they who wi&s;hed well to it, had not credit or courage to advance; <Q>yet &s;till found means to convey their advice to <HI>Oxford,</HI> &startq;that&endq; the King &s;hould not give over that importunity: and they who had little hopes of better effects from it, were yet of opinion,</Q> <Q>&startq;that the neglecting tho&s;e gracious invitations, made by his Maje&s;ty for Peace, would &s;hortly make the Parliament &s;o odious, that they would not&endq; dare long to continue in the &s;ame ob&s;tinacy.</Q> The <HI>Scots</HI> were griev'd and enraged, to &s;ee their Idol Presbytery &s;o undervalued, and &s;light|ed, that be&s;ides the Independents power in the City, their very A&s;|&s;embly <MILESTONE N="50"> of Divines every day lo&s;t credit and authority to &s;upport it; and de&s;ired nothing more than a Treaty for Peace: and many others
<PB N="574" REF="6500">
who had contributed mo&s;t to the &s;uppre&s;&s;ion of the King's power, were now much more afraid of their own Army, than ever they had been of His Authority; and believ'd, that if a Treaty were once &s;et on foot, it would not be in the power of the mo&s;t violent to render it ineffectual: or whatever they believ'd them&s;elves, they conveyed this to &s;ome about the King, as the concurrent advice of all who pretended to wi&s;h well: and &s;ome Men took upon them to &s;end the Subject of what Me&s;&s;age the King &s;hould &s;end, and cloathed in &s;uch expre&s;&s;ions, as they con|ceived were like to gain ground; which his Maje&s;ty could not but graciou&s;ly accept; though he very &s;eldom imitated their Style. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>

<P>WHEN all hopes, as I &s;aid, were de&s;perate of any Treaty with the <NOTE PLACE="marg">The King tries to deal with the Indepen|dents:</NOTE> Parliament, and con&s;equently many hazards were to be run, in the contriving a Peace any other way; the &s;u&s;taining the War, with any probability of Succe&s;s, was the next de&s;irable thing to a Peace, and pre|&s;erable before any &s;uch Peace, as was probably to be hoped for from <MILESTONE N="50"> the Party that govern'd the Army, which govern'd the Parliament. The King therefore u&s;ed all the means which occurr'd to him, or which were advi&s;ed and propo&s;ed by others, to divide the Independent Party;
<PB N="576" REF="6520">
and to prevail with &s;ome principal Per&s;ons of them, to find their con|tent and &s;atisfaction in advancing His Intere&s;t. That Party compre|hended many, who were not &s;o much Enemies to the State, or to the Church, as not to de&s;ire heartily that a Peace might be e&s;tabli&s;hed upon the foundations of both, &s;o their own particular ambitions might be complied with. To them the King thought he might be able to propo&s;e very valuable compen&s;ations for any Service they could do him; and the power of the Presbyterians, as they were in conjunction with the <HI>Scots,</HI> &s;eem'd no unnatural Argument to work upon tho&s;e, who profe&s;&s;ed to be &s;wayed by matter of Liberty of Con&s;cience in Re|ligion: <MILESTONE N="10"> &s;ince it was out of all que&s;tion, that they &s;hould never find the lea&s;t &s;atisfaction to their Scruples, and their Principles in Church Government, from tho&s;e who pretended to erect the Kingdom of <HI>Je&s;us Chri&s;t.</HI> And it was thought to be no ill pre&s;age towards the repairing of the Fabrick of the Church of <HI>England,</HI> that it's two mortal Ene|mies, who had expo&s;ed it to &s;o much per&s;ecution and oppre&s;&s;ion, hated each other as mortally, and labour'd each others de&s;truction, with the &s;ame fury and zeal, they had both practiced towards Her. This rea|&s;onable imagination very much di&s;po&s;ed the King, who was well ac|quainted with the unruly &s;pirit and malice of the Presbyrerians, to <MILESTONE N="20"> think it po&s;&s;ible that he might receive &s;ome benefit from the Indepen|dents; a Faction newly grown up, and with which he was utterly un|acquainted: and his Maje&s;ties extraordinary Affection for the Church made him the le&s;s weigh, and con&s;ider the incompatibility, and irre|concilablene&s;s of that Faction with the Government of the State; of which, it may be, he was the le&s;s &s;en&s;ible, becau&s;e he thought nothing more impo&s;&s;ible, than that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation &s;hould &s;ubmit to any other than Monarchical Government. There were be&s;ides an over|active and bu&s;y kind of Men, who &s;till undertook to make Overtures as agreeable to the wi&s;h of &s;ome principal Leaders of that Party, and <MILESTONE N="30"> as with their Authority, and &s;o prevailed with the King, to &s;uffer &s;ome Per&s;ons of credit near him, to make &s;ome Propo&s;itions, in his Name, to particular Per&s;ons. And it is very probable, that as the &s;ame Men, made the expectations of tho&s;e People appear to the King much more rea&s;onable and moderate, than in truth they were, &s;o they per&s;waded the others to believe, that his Maje&s;ty would yield to many more im|portant conce&s;&s;ions, than he would ever be induced to grant. So either <NOTE PLACE="marg">But in vain.</NOTE> &s;ide had, in a &s;hort time, a clear view into each others intentions, and quickly gave over any expectation of benefit That way; &s;ave that the Independents were willing, that the King &s;hould cheri&s;h the hopes <MILESTONE N="40"> of their complyance, and the King as willing that they &s;hould believe that his Maje&s;ty might be prevailed with to grant more, than at fir&s;t he appear'd re&s;olv'd to do.</P>
<P>THE truth is, though that Party was mo&s;t prevalent in the Parlia|ment, and comprehended all the Superior Officers of the Army (the General only excepted; who thought him&s;elf a Presbyterian) yet there were only three Men, <HI>Vane, Cromwell,</HI> and <HI>Ireton,</HI> who govern'd and di&s;po&s;ed all the re&s;t according to their Sentiments; and without doubt they had not yet publi&s;hed their dark de&s;igns to many of their own Party, nor would their Party, at that time, have been &s;o numerous and <MILESTONE N="50"> con&s;iderable, if they had known, or but imagin'd, that they had enter|tain'd tho&s;e thoughts of heart, which they grew every day le&s;s tender to conceal, and forward enough to di&s;cover.</P>
<P><PB N="577" REF="6530">
THERE was another intrigue now &s;et on foot, with much more pro|bability <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>A Treaty be|tween the King and the</HI> Scots, <HI>&s;et on foot by the in|terpo&s;ition of</HI> France: <HI>And</HI> Montre|vil <HI>is &s;ent for that purpo&s;e.</HI></NOTE> of Succe&s;s, both in re&s;pect of the thing it &s;elf, and the circum|&s;tances with which it came accompanied; and that was a Treaty with the <HI>Scots,</HI> by the interpo&s;ition and mediation of the Crown of <HI>France;</HI> which, to that purpo&s;e at this time, &s;ent an Envoy, one <HI>Montrevil,</HI> to <HI>London,</HI> with &s;ome formal Addre&s;s to the Parliament, but intentionally to Negotiate between the King and the <HI>Scots;</HI> who&s;e Agent at <HI>Paris</HI> had given encouragement to the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> then there, to hope that that Nation would return to their duty; and the Queen Regent, in the great genero&s;ity of her heart, did really de&s;ire to contribute all <MILESTONE N="10"> that was in Her power to the King's recovery.

<P>THIS was the fir&s;t in&s;tance, and it will appear a very &s;orry one, that a Forreign Soveraign Prince gave, of wi&s;hing a reconciliation, or to put a period to the Civil War in his Maje&s;ties Dominions; towards the contrivance whereof, and the frequent fomenting it, too many of them <MILESTONE N="20"> contributed too much. <Q>The old Maxim, &startq;that the Crown of <HI>England</HI> could ballance the differences which fell out between the Princes of&endq; <HI>Europe,</HI> by it's inclining to either Party, had made the Mini&s;ters of our State too negligent in cultivating the Affections of their Neighbours by any real obligations;</Q> as if they were to be Arbiters only in the diffe|rences which fell out between others, without being them&s;elves liable to any impre&s;&s;ion of adver&s;e Fortune. This made the unexpected cala|mity that befell this Kingdom, not ingrateful to it's Neighbours on all &s;ides; who were willing to &s;ee it weaken'd and cha&s;ti&s;ed by it's own &s;trokes.</P>
<P>CARDINAL <HI>Richelieu,</HI> out of the haughtine&s;s of his own nature, and <MILESTONE N="30"> immoderate appetite of revenge, under the di&s;gui&s;e of being jealous of the Honour of his Ma&s;ter, had di&s;cover'd an implacable hatred again&s;t the <HI>Engli&s;h,</HI> ever &s;ince that unhappy provocation by the Inva&s;ion of the I&s;le of <HI>Ree,</HI> and the declared Protection of <HI>Rochel;</HI> and took the fir&s;t opportunity from the indi&s;po&s;ition and murmurs of <HI>Scotland,</HI> to warm that People into Rebellion, and &s;aw the poy&s;on thereof pro&s;per, and &s;pread to his own wi&s;h; which he fomented by the <HI>French</HI> Em|ba&s;&s;adour in the Parliament, with all the Venome of his Heart; as hath been mention'd before.

<P>BUT that great Cardinal being now dead, and the King him&s;elf dying within a &s;hort time after, the Admini&s;tration of the Affairs of that King|dom, <MILESTONE N="50"> in the infancy of the King, and under his Mother, the Queen Regent, was committed to Cardinal <HI>Mazarin,</HI> an <HI>Italian</HI> by birth, and rai&s;ed by <HI>Richelieu</HI> to the degree of a Cardinal, for his great dexterity in
<PB N="578" REF="6540">
putting <HI>Ca&s;al</HI> into the hands of <HI>France,</HI> when the <HI>Spaniard</HI> had given it up to him, as the Nuntio of the Pope, and in tru&s;t that it &s;hould remain in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of his Holine&s;s, till the Title of the Duke of <HI>Mantua</HI> &s;hould be determined. This Cardinal was a Man rather of different, than contrary parts from his Predece&s;&s;or; and fitter to build upon the Foun|dations which he had laid, than to have laid tho&s;e Foundations; and to cultivate, by Artifice, Dexterity, and Di&s;&s;imulation (in which his Nature and Parts excell'd) what the other had begun with great re&s;olution and vigour, and even gone through with invincible con&s;tancy and courage. So that, the one having broken the heart of all oppo&s;ition and contra|diction <MILESTONE N="10"> to the Crown, by the cutting off the head of the Duke of <HI>Mont|morancy,</HI> and reducing Mon&s;ieur, the Brother of the King, to the mo&s;t tame &s;ubmi&s;&s;ion, and incapacity of fomenting another Rebellion, it was very ea&s;y for the other, to find a complyance from all Men, now &s;uffi|ciently terrified from any contradiction. And how great things &s;oever this la&s;t Mini&s;ter perform'd for the Service of that Crown, during the Mino|rity of the King, they may all, in ju&s;tice, be imputed to the prudence and providence of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu;</HI> who had reduced and di&s;po&s;ed the whole Nation to an entire Subjection and Submi&s;&s;ion to what &s;hould be impo&s;ed upon them. <MILESTONE N="20"></P>
<P>CARDINAL <HI>Mazarin,</HI> when he came fir&s;t to that great Mini&s;try, was without any Per&s;onal Animo&s;ity again&s;t our King, or the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation; and was no otherwi&s;e delighted with the di&s;traction and con|fu&s;ion they were both involv'd in, than as it di&s;abled the whole People from making &s;uch a conjunction with the <HI>Spaniard,</HI> as might make the pro&s;ecution of that War (upon which his whole Heart was &s;et) the more difficult to him: which he had the more rea&s;on to apprehend&punc; by the Re&s;idence of <HI>Don Alon&s;o de Cardenas,</HI> Emba&s;&s;adour from the King of <HI>Spain,</HI> &s;till at <HI>London,</HI> making all addre&s;&s;es to the Parliament. When the Queen had been compell'd in the la&s;t year, upon the advance of the Earl <MILESTONE N="30"> of <HI>E&s;&s;ex</HI> into the We&s;t, to Tran&s;port her &s;elf out of <HI>Cornwal</HI> into <HI>France,</HI> &s;he had found there as good a reception, as &s;he could expect; and receiv'd as many expre&s;&s;ions of kindne&s;s from the Queen Regent, and as ample promi&s;es from the Cardinal, as &s;he could wi&s;h. So that &s;he promi&s;ed her &s;elf a very good effect from her Journey; and did procure from him &s;uch a pre&s;ent &s;upply of Armes and Ammunition, as, though of no great value in it &s;elf, &s;he was willing to interpret, as a good evidence of the reality of his intentions. But the Cardinal did not yet think the King's condition low enough; and rather de&s;ired, by admini&s;tring little and ordinary Sup|plies, to enable him to continue the &s;truggle, than to &s;ee him victorious <MILESTONE N="40"> over his Enemies; when he might more remember, how &s;lender Aid he had receiv'd, than that he had been a&s;&s;i&s;ted; and might hereafter make him&s;elf Arbiter of the Peace between the two Crowns. Wherefore he was more &s;ollicitous to keep a good corre&s;pondence with the Parliament, and to profe&s;s a Neutrality between the King and them, than inclined to give them any jealou&s;y, by appearing much concern'd for the King.</P>
<P>BUT after the Battle of <HI>Na&s;eby</HI> was lo&s;t, and that the King &s;eem'd &s;o totally defeated, that he had very little hope of appearing again in the head of an Army, that might be able to re&s;i&s;t the Enemy, the Car|dinal was awakened to new apprehen&s;ions; and &s;aw more cau&s;e to fear <MILESTONE N="50"> the Mon&s;trous power of the Parliament, after they had totally &s;ubdued the King, than ever he had to apprehend the exce&s;s of greatne&s;s in the Crown: and therefore, be&s;ides the frequent incitements he receiv'd from
<PB N="579" REF="6550">
the genero&s;ity of the Queen Regent, who really de&s;ired to &s;upply &s;ome Sub&s;tantial relief to the King, he was him&s;elf willing to receive any Pro|po&s;itions from the Queen of <HI>England,</HI> by which She thought that the King her Husband's Service might be advanced; and had allways the dex|terity and artifice, by letting things fall in di&s;cour&s;e, in the pre&s;ence of tho&s;e, who, he knew, would ob&s;erve and report what they heard or con|ceiv'd, to cau&s;e that to be propo&s;ed to him, which he had mo&s;t mind to do, or to engage him&s;elf in. So he had application enough from the Covenanting Party of <HI>Scotland</HI> (who from the beginning had depended upon <HI>France,</HI> by the encouragement and promi&s;es of Cardinal <HI>Richelieu)</HI> <MILESTONE N="10"> to know how to direct them, to apply them&s;elves to the Queen of <HI>Eng|land,</HI> that they might come recommended by her Maje&s;ty to him, as a good Expedient for the King's Service. For they were not now re&s;erv'd in their complaints of the treatment they receiv'd from the Parliament, and of the terrible apprehen&s;ion they had of being di&s;appointed of all their hopes, by the prevalence of the Independent Army, and of their Faction in both Hou&s;es; and therefore wi&s;hed nothing more, than a good opportunity to make a firm conjunction with the King; towards which they had all encouragement from the Cardinal, if they made their addre&s;s to the Queen, and if her Maje&s;ty would de&s;ire the Cardinal to conduct it. <MILESTONE N="20"> And becau&s;e many things mu&s;t be promi&s;ed, on the King's behalf, to the <HI>Scots</HI> upon this their engagement, <Q>&startq;the Crown of <HI>France</HI> &s;hould give credit and engage, as well that the <HI>Scots</HI> &s;hould perform all that they &s;hould promi&s;e, as that the King &s;hould make good what&s;oever &s;hould&endq; be undertaken by Him, or by the Queen on his behalf.</Q></P>
<P>THIS was the occa&s;ion and ground of &s;ending Mon&s;ieur <HI>Montrevil</HI> into <HI>England,</HI> as is mention'd before. He arriv'd there in <HI>January,</HI> with <NOTE PLACE="marg">Montrevil<HI>'s Negotiation with the King.</HI></NOTE> as much credit as the Queen Regent could give him to the <HI>Scots,</HI> and as the Queen of <HI>England</HI> could give him to the King; who likewi&s;e per|&s;waded his Maje&s;ty, to believe, <Q>&startq;that <HI>France</HI> was now become really kind <MILESTONE N="30"> to him, and would engage all it's power to &s;erve him; and that the Car|dinal was well a&s;&s;ured, that the <HI>Scots</HI> would behave them&s;elves hence|forwards&endq; very hone&s;tly: which his Maje&s;ty was willing to believe, when all other hopes had failed;</Q> and all the Overtures made by him for a Treaty had been rejected. But it was not long before he was undeceiv'd; and di&s;|cern'd that this Treaty was not like to produce better fruit, than his for|mer Overtures had done. For the fir&s;t information he receiv'd from <HI>Mon|trevil,</HI> after his arrival in <HI>England,</HI> and after he had conferr'd with the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, was, <Q>&startq;that they peremptorily in&s;i&s;ted upon his Maje&s;ties conde&s;cen&s;ion, and promi&s;e, for the e&s;tabli&s;hment of the Pres|byterian <MILESTONE N="40"> Government in <HI>England,</HI> as it was in <HI>Scotland;</HI> without which,&endq; he &s;aid, there was no hope, that they would ever joyn with his Maje&s;ty;</Q> <Q>and therefore the Envoy pre&s;&s;ed his Maje&s;ty &startq;to give them &s;atisfaction therein, as the advice of the Queen Regent and the Cardinal, and likewi&s;e&endq; of the Queen his Wife; which exceedingly troubled the King.</Q> <Q>And the <HI>Scots</HI> alledged confidently, &startq;&endq; that the Queen had expre&s;sly promi&s;ed to S^r <HI>Robert Moray</HI></Q> (a cunning and a dextrous Man, who had been employed by them to her Maje&s;ty) <Q>&startq;&endq; that his Maje&s;ty &s;hould con&s;ent thereunto.

Nor could all the Importunity or Arguments, u&s;ed by <HI>Montrevil,</HI> prevail with his Maje&s;ty to enlarge tho&s;e conce&s;&s;ions, or in the <MILESTONE N="20"> lea&s;t to recede from the con&s;tancy of his re&s;olution;</Q> <Q>though he inform'd him of &startq;the di&s;&s;atisfaction both the <HI>Scotch</HI> Commi&s;&s;ioners, and the Pres|byterians in <HI>London</HI> had in his Maje&s;ties re&s;olution, and aver&s;ene&s;s from gratifying them in that, which they allways had, and allways would in&s;i&s;t upon; and that the <HI>Scots</HI> were re&s;olv'd to have no more to do with his Maje&s;ty; but to agree with the Independents; from whom they could have better conditions than from Him; and he fear'd &s;uch&endq; an Agreement was too far advanced already.</Q></P>
<P>MANY An&s;wers and Replies pa&s;&s;ed between the King and <HI>Montrevil</HI> in Cipher, and with all imaginable Secrecy; in which, whatever re|proaches <MILESTONE N="30"> were ca&s;t upon him afterwards, he allways gave the King very clear and impartial information of the temper, and of the di&s;cour&s;es of tho&s;e People with whom he was to tran&s;act. And though he did, upon all occa&s;ions, with much earne&s;tne&s;s, advi&s;e his Maje&s;ty to con&s;ent to the unrea&s;onable demands of the <HI>Scots,</HI> which, he did believe, he would be at la&s;t compell'd to do, yet it is as certain, that he did u&s;e all the Arguments the talent of his under&s;tanding, which was a very good one, could &s;ugge&s;t to him, to per&s;wade the <HI>Scots</HI> to be contented with what the King had &s;o frankly offer'd and granted to them; and did all he could to per&s;wade and convince them, that their own pre&s;ervation, and that of their Nation de|pended <MILESTONE N="40"> upon the pre&s;ervation of the King, and the &s;upport of his Regal Authority. And it is very memorable, that, in An&s;wer to a Letter which <HI>Montrevil</HI> writ to the King, and in which he per&s;waded his Maje&s;ty, to agree with the <HI>Scots</HI> upon their own demands, and among&s;t other Argu|ments, <Q>a&s;&s;ured his Maje&s;ty, &startq;that the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Presbyterians were fully agreed with the <HI>Scots</HI> (which his Maje&s;ty believ'd they would never be) the <HI>Scots</HI> having declared, that they would never in&s;i&s;t upon the &s;ettling&endq; any other Government than was at that time practiced in <HI>London;</HI></Q> urg|ing many other &s;ucce&s;&s;es, which they had at that time obtain'd; the King, after &s;ome expre&s;&s;ions of his adhering to what he had formerly declared, <MILESTONE N="50"> u&s;ed the&s;e words in his Letter of the 21^&s;^t of <HI>January</HI> to Mon&s;ieur <HI>Mon|trevil,</HI> <Q>&startq;Let them never flatter them&s;elves &s;o with their good &s;ucce&s;&s;es: without pretending to Prophecy, I will foretel their ruin, except they
<PB N="581" REF="6570">
&endq; agree with Me; however it &s;hall plea&s;e God to di&s;po&s;e of Me; which they had great rea&s;on to remember after.</Q></P>
<P>BUT becau&s;e, though this Treaty was begun, and proceeded &s;o far as is recited, before the end of the pre&s;ent year, yet it was carried on, and did not conclude, till &s;ome Months after the next year was begun, we &s;hall put an end to our Relation of it at pre&s;ent, and re&s;ume what re|mains, in it's place of the year en&s;uing: Only, before we fini&s;h our Ac|count of the Actions of this unfortunate year forty five, we mu&s;t men|tion one more, which happen'd on the two and twentieth of <HI>March,</HI> ju&s;t as the year was expiring. <MILESTONE N="10"></P>
<P>THE King had hoped to draw out of the few Garri&s;ons &s;till in his po&s;|&s;e&s;&s;ion, <NOTE PLACE="marg"><HI>The year</HI> 1645 <HI>concludes with the Defeat of the Lord</HI> A&s;t|ley<HI>'s Forces.</HI></NOTE> &s;uch a Body of Hor&s;e and Foot, as might enable him to take the Field early in the Spring, though without any fixed de&s;ign. But this was da&s;h'd in the very beginning, by the total Rout and Defeat, the Lord <HI>A&s;t|ley</HI> underwent; who being upon his March from <HI>Worce&s;ter</HI> towards <HI>Ox|ford,</HI> with two thou&s;and Hor&s;e and Foot, and the King having appointed to meet him, with another Body of fifteen hundred Hor&s;e and Foot, Let|ters and Orders mi&s;carried, and were intercepted; whereby the Enemy came to have notice of the re&s;olution, and drew a much greater &s;trength from their &s;everal Garri&s;ons of <HI>Glouce&s;ter, Warwick, Coventry,</HI> and <HI>Eve|&s;ham.</HI> <MILESTONE N="20"> So that the Lord <HI>A&s;tley</HI> was no &s;ooner upon his march, but they follow'd him; and the &s;econd day, after he had marched all night, when he thought he had e&s;caped all their Quarters, they fell upon his wearied Troops; which, though a bold and &s;tout re&s;i&s;tance was made, were at la&s;t totally defeated; and the Lord <HI>A&s;tley</HI> him&s;elf, S^r <HI>Charles Lucas,</HI> who was Lieutenant General of the Hor&s;e, and mo&s;t of the other Officers, who were not kill'd, were taken Pri&s;oners. The few who e&s;caped, were &s;o &s;catter'd and di&s;per&s;ed, that they never came together again; nor did there remain, from that time, any po&s;&s;ibility for the King to draw any other Troops together in the Field. <MILESTONE N="30"></P>
