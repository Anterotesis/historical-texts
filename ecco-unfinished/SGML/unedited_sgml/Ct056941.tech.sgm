KING.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>SIR,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>'TIS not the lea&s;t of the Extraordinaries of Your
Maje&s;ty's Character, That as you are King of
Your People, &s;o You are the Peoples King.</P>
<P>This Title, as it is the Mo&s;t Glorious, &s;o is it the
Mo&s;t Indi&s;putable in the World.</P>
<P>God him&s;elf appointed, the Prophet proclaim'd, but
the Peoples a&s;&s;ent was the fini&s;hing the Royal Authority
of the fir&s;t King of <HI>I&s;rael.</HI></P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty, among all the Ble&s;&s;ings of Your Reign,
has re&s;tor'd this, as the be&s;t of all our Enjoyments, the full
Liberty of Original Right in its Actings and Exerci&s;e.</P>
<P>Former Reigns have Invaded it, and the la&s;t thought
it totally &s;uppre&s;t, but as Liberty revived under Your
Maje&s;ty's ju&s;t Authority, this was the fir&s;t Flower &s;he
brought forth.</P>
<P>The Author of the&s;e Sheets humbly hopes, That what
Your Maje&s;ty has &s;o Gloriou&s;ly Re&s;tor'd, what our
Laws and Con&s;titution have Declared and Setled, and
what Truth and Ju&s;tice openly appears for, he may be
allow'd to Vindicate.</P>
<P>Your Maje&s;ty knows too well the Nature of Govern|ment,
to think it at all the le&s;s Honourable, or the more
Precarious, for being Devolv'd from and Center'd in
the Con&s;ent of your People.</P>
<P><PB REF="4">
The pretence of Patriarchal Authority, had it really
an uninterrupted Succe&s;&s;ion, can never be &s;upported
again&s;t the demon&s;trated Practice of all Nations; but
being al&s;o Deve&s;ted of the chief Support it might have
had, if that Succe&s;&s;ion could have been prov'd. The Au|thority
of Governours <HI>Jure Divino</HI> has &s;unk Ignomini|ou&s;ly
to the Ground, as a prepo&s;terous and incon&s;i&s;tent
Forgery.</P>
<P>And yet, if <HI>Vox Populi</HI> be, as 'tis generally allow'd,
<HI>Vox Dei,</HI> Your Maje&s;ty's Right to the&s;e Kingdoms <HI>Jure
Divino,</HI> is more plain than any of Your Predece&s;&s;ors.</P>
<P>How happy are the&s;e Nations, after all the Oppre&s;|&s;ions
and Tyranny of Arbitrary Rulers, to obtain a King
who Reigns by the univer&s;al Voice of the People, and
has the greate&s;t &s;hare in their Affections that ever any
Prince enjoy'd, Queen <HI>Elizabeth</HI> only excepted.</P>
<P>And how vain are the Attempts of a Neighbouring
Prince, to Nur&s;e up a <HI>Contemptible Impo&s;tor,</HI> upon the
pretence of Forming a Claim on the Foundation of but
a pretended Succe&s;&s;ion, again&s;t the Con&s;ent of the general
Suffrage of the Nation.</P>
<P>To what purpo&s;e &s;hall all the Proofs of his Legitimacy
be, <HI>&s;uppo&s;ing it could be made out,</HI> when the univer&s;al
Voice of the People, already expre&s;s'd in enacted Laws,
&s;hall an&s;wer, <HI>We will not have this Man to Reign over us.</HI></P>
<P>May this Affection of Your Subjects continue to the
late&s;t Hour of Your Life, and may Your Satisfaction be
&s;uch as may convince the World, <HI>That the Chiefest Fe|licity
of a Crown con&s;i&s;ts in the Affections, as the fir&s;t Autho|rity
of it derives from the Con&s;ent of the People.</HI></P>

<HEAD>TO THE
Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
AND THE
Commons of England.</HEAD>
<OPENER><SALUTE>My Lords and Gentlemen,</SALUTE></OPENER>
<P>THE vindication of the Original Right of all Men
to the Government of them&s;elves, is &s;o far from a
Derogation from, that it is a Confirmation of your
Legal Authority.</P>
<P>Your Lord&s;hips, who are of the Nobility have your Original
Right, your Titles and Dignities from the Greatne&s;s of your
Shares in the Freeholds of the Nation: If Merit has rai&s;ed
any of your Ancestors to di&s;tingui&s;hing Honours; or, if the
Royal Favours of Princes has Dignified Families, it has always
been thought fit to bestow or to enable them to Purcha&s;e &s;ome
Portion of the Freehold of <HI>England</HI> to be annexed to the &s;aid
Titles, to make &s;uch Dignity rational, as well as to &s;upport the
Succe&s;&s;ion of Honour.</P>
<P>From hence you are Ve&s;ted with Sovereign Judicature, a$
being the properest to be tru&s;ted with the Di&s;tribution of Justice
in that Country, of which you were &s;uppo&s;ed to have, and once
had, the principal Propriety.</P>
<P>From hence you &s;it in Parliament as a Branch of our Con|&s;titution,
being part of the Collective Body, repre&s;enting no
Body but your &s;elves; and as a Te&s;timony that the Original of
all Power Centers in the whole.</P>
<P><PB REF="6">
The re&s;t of the Freeholders have Originally a Right to &s;it
there with you, but being too numerous a Body, they have long
&s;ince agreed that whenever the King thinks fit to advi&s;e with
his People, they will chu&s;e a certain few out of their Great Body
to meet together with your Lord&s;hips.</P>
<P>Here, in &s;hort, is the Original of Parliaments; and here,
if Power at any time meet with a Cest of Government, Bi|&s;hops
and Thrones become Vacant to this Original, all Power of
Cour&s;e returns. This is the happy Center in the great Circle
of Politick Order.</P>
<P>From hence at the late Revolution, when the King de&s;erted
the Administration, and His pre&s;ent Majesty was in Arms
in <HI>England,</HI> Nature directed the People to have Recour&s;e to
your Lord&s;hips, and to de&s;ire your Appearance as the Heads of
the great Collective Body; and all the Champions for the great
Arguments of Divine Right could not in that Exigence have
Recour&s;e to one Pre&s;ident, nor to One Rule of Proceeding,
but what Nature would have Dictated to the Meanest Judg|ment,
<HI>viz. That the Nation being left without a Gover|nour,
the Proprietors &s;hould meet to con&s;ider of ano|ther.</HI></P>
<P>And you <HI>Gentlemen of the Hou&s;e of Commons,</HI> who
are the Repre&s;entatives of your Country, you are this great
Collective Body in Minature, you are an Abridgment of the
many Volumes of the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Nation.</P>
<P>To you they have trusted jointly with the King and the
Lords, the Power of making Laws, rai&s;ing Taxes, and Im|peaching
Criminals: But how? 'Tis in the Name of all the
<HI>Commons of England,</HI> who&s;e Repre&s;enata$ives you are.</P>
<P>All your Power is yours, as you are a Full and Free Re|pre&s;entative.
I no where attempt to prove what <HI>Powers</HI> you
have not, po&s;&s;ibly the Extent of your Legal Authority was
never fully under&s;tood, nor have you ever thought fit to Explain
<PB REF="7">
it. But this I may be bold to advance, That whatever
<HI>Powers</HI> you have, or may have, you cannot Exerci&s;e but in the
Name of the <HI>Commons of England,</HI> and you enjoy them as
their Repre&s;entative, and for their V&s;e.</P>
<P>All this is not &s;aid to le&s;&s;en your Authority; Nor can it be
the Interest of any <HI>Engli&s;h Freeholder</HI> to le&s;&s;en the Authority
of the <HI>Commons</HI> a&s;&s;embled in <HI>Parliament.</HI></P>
<P>You are the Con&s;ervators of our Liberties, the Expo&s;itors of
our Laws, the Levyers of our Taxes, and the Redre&s;&s;ors of
our Grievances, the King's best Councellors, and the Peoples
last Refuge.</P>
<P>But if you are Di&s;&s;olved, for you are not Immortal; or if
you are Deceived, for you are not Infallible; twas never yet
&s;uppo&s;ed, till very lately, that all <HI>Power</HI> dies with you.</P>
<P>You may Die, but the People remain; you may be Di&s;&s;olved,
and all immediate Right may cea&s;e; Power may have its In|tervals,
and Crowns their <HI>Interregnum;</HI> but Original Power
cndures to the &s;ame Eternity the World endures to: And while
there is People, there may be a Legal Authority Delegated,
though all Succe&s;&s;ion of Sub&s;tituted Power were at an End.</P>
<P>Nor have I advanced any new Doctrine, nothing but what
is as ancient as Nature, and born into the World with our
Rea&s;on: And I think it would be a Sin again&s;t the <HI>Parlia|ment
of England,</HI> to &s;uggest that they would be offended either
with the Doctrine or with the Author, &s;ince 'tis what their own
Authority is built upon, and what the <HI>Laws of England</HI> have
given their a&s;&s;ent unto by confirming the Acts of the la&s;t
<HI>Collective Body of the People,</HI> from whencethe pre&s;ent Settle|ment
of the Nation does derive.</P>
<P>Wherefore I make no Apology for Protection or Favour as
$word$ the Fact; as to Errors of Language I am ready to ask
P$rdon $f I offend, declaring my Intention is neither for nor
<PB REF="8">
again&s;t either Per&s;on or Party. As there is but <HI>One Intere&s;t</HI>
in the Nation, I wi&s;h there were but <HI>One Party,</HI> and that
Party would adhere to Vnbyas'd Justice, and pur&s;ue the Ho|nour
and Inter&s;t of the <HI>Prote&s;tant Religion,</HI> and the <HI>Eng|li&s;h
Liberty.</HI></P>

<HEAD>The Original
RIGHT
OF THE
People of England,
Examined and A&s;&s;erted.</HEAD>
<P>I Have ob&s;erv'd, when Intere&s;t obliges any Per&s;on or Party to
defend the Cau&s;e they have E&s;pous'd, they plea&s;e them&s;elves
with fancying they conceal their Private De&s;igns, by cover|ing
their Di&s;cour&s;es with Gay Titles.</P>
<P>Like a late Act of Parliament, which in the Preamble calls it
&s;elf, <HI>An Act for the Relief of Creditors,</HI> but in its Effect was really
<HI>an Act for the Relief of Debtors.</HI></P>
<P>Thus &s;ome Gentlemen place fine &s;pecious Titles on their Books,
as <HI>Jure Populi Anglicani, A Vindication of the Rights of the Com|mons
of</HI> England, and a <HI>Vindication of the Rights of the Lords,</HI>
and the like; and with large and high Encomiums upon the
Excellency of our Con&s;titution, treat the levity of &s;ome Peoples
Judgments with fine Notions; whereas the true End and De&s;ign
is de&s;ending the Intere&s;t and Party they have E&s;pous'd.</P>
<P>The Defence of the Rights of the Repre&s;entative Body of the
People, under&s;tood by the Name of the Commons of <HI>England</HI> in
Parliament, <HI>is a great Point;</HI> and &s;o plain are their Rights, that
'tis no extraordinary Task to defend them: But for any Man to
advance, that they are &s;o Augu&s;t an A&s;&s;embly that no Objection
<PB N="2" REF="10">
ought to be made to their Actions, nor no Reflection upon their
Conduct, though the Fact be true; and that it is not to be exa|min'd
whether the Thing &s;aid be true, but what Authority the
Per&s;on &s;peaking has to &s;ay it, <HI>is a Doctrine wholly new,</HI> and &s;eems
to me to be a Badge of more Slavery to our own Repre&s;entative
than ever the People of <HI>England</HI> owes them, or than ever they
them&s;elves expected.</P>
<P>This therefore, together with &s;ome Inva&s;ions of the Peoples
Rights made publick by &s;everal Modern Authors, are the Rea&s;ons
why I have adventur'd, <HI>being wholly Di&s;inter&s;ted and Vnconcerned
either for Per&s;ons or Parties,</HI> to make a &s;hort E&s;&s;ay at declaring
the Rights of the People of <HI>England,</HI> not Repre&s;entatively but Col|lectively
con&s;idered.</P>
<P>And with due Defference to the Repre&s;entative Body of the
Nation, I hope I may &s;ay, <HI>it can be no Dimination of their Rights,</HI>
to a&s;&s;ert the Rights of that Body from whom they derive the
Powers and Priviledges of their Hou&s;e, and which are the very
Foundation of their Being. For if the Original Right of the People
be overthrown, the Power of the Repre&s;entative, which is &s;ub&s;e|quent
and &s;ubordinate, mu&s;t dye of it &s;elf.</P>
<P>And becau&s;e I have to do rather with Rea&s;on and the Nature
of the Thing, than with Laws and Precedents, I &s;hall make but
very little u&s;e of Authors, and Quotations of Statutes, &s;ince Fun|damentals
and Principles both in Law and Argument, are &s;uperiour
to Laws or Examples.</P>
<P>To come directly to what I de&s;ign in the following Papers, 'tis
nece&s;&s;ary to lay down &s;ome Maxims, other than what a late<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> Vindication of the Commons.</NOTE> Au|thor
has furni&s;h'd us with.</P>
<P>1. That <HI>Salas Populi &s;uprema Lex,</HI> all Government, and con&s;e|quently
our whole Con&s;titution, was originally de&s;ign'd, and is
maintain'd, for the Support of the Peoples Property, who are
the Governed.</P>
<P>2. That all the Members of Government, whether King, Lords
or Commons, if they Invert the Great End of their In&s;titution,
the Publick Good cea&s;e to be in the &s;ame Publick Capacity,
<Q><P>&startq;And Power retreats to its Original.&endq;</P>
<P>True Engli&s;hman, P. 28.</P></Q></P>
<P><PB N="3" REF="11">
3. That no Collective or Repre&s;entative Body of Men what &s;o|ever,
in Matters of Politicks any more than Religion, <HI>are or ever
have been Infallible.</HI></P>
<P>4. That Rea&s;on is the Te&s;t and Touch-&s;tone of Laws, and that
all Law or Power that is Contradictory to Rea&s;on, is <HI>ip&s;o facto</HI> void
in it &s;elf, and ought not to be obeyed.</P>
<P>The&s;e four Generals run through the whole following Di&s;cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Some other Maxims le&s;s General are the Con&s;equence of the&s;e; as,</P>
<P><HI>First,</HI> That &s;uch Laws as are agreeable to Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice
being once made, are binding both to King, Lords and Com|mons,
either &s;eparately, or conjunctively, till they are actually Re|pealed
in due Form.</P>
<P>That if either of the Three Powers do Di&s;pen&s;e with, Su&s;pend, or
otherwi&s;e Break any of the known Laws &s;o made, they Injure the
Con&s;titution; and the Power &s;o acting ought to be re&s;trained by the
other Powers not concurring according to what is lately allowed,<NOTE PLACE="marg">Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> Vindication of the Commons.</NOTE>
<HI>That every Branch of Power is de&s;igned as a Check upon each other.</HI></P>
<P>But if all the Three Powers &s;hould joyn in &s;uch an Irregular
Action, the Con&s;titution &s;uffers a Convul&s;ion, Dies, and is Di&s;|&s;olved
of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Nor does it &s;uffice to &s;ay, That King, Lords and Commons can
do no Wrong, &s;ince <HI>the mutual Con&s;ent of Parties,</HI> on which that
fooli&s;h Maxim is grounded, does not extend to every Action King,
Lords and Commons are capable of doing.</P>
<P>There are Laws which re&s;pect the Common Rights of the People,
as they are the Parties to be Governed, and with re&s;pect to the&s;e the
King can do no Wrong, but all is laid upon his Mini&s;ters&mdash;-who
are accountable.</P>
<P>And there are Laws which particularly re&s;pect the Con&s;titution;
the King, Lords and Commons, as they are the Parties governing$$
In this regard each Branch, may Wrong and Oppre&s;s the other,
or all together, may do Wrong to the People they are made to
Govern.</P>
<P>The King may Invade the Peoples Properties, and if the Lords
and Commons omit to defend and protect them, <HI>they all do Wrong</HI> by
a tacit approving tho&s;e Abu&s;es they ought to oppo&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="4" REF="12">
The Commons may extend their Power to an exorbitant Degree,
in Impri&s;oning the Subjects, Di&s;pen&s;ing with the <HI>Habaeus Corpus</HI>
Act, giving unlimited Power to their Sergeant to Oppre&s;s the People
in his Cu&s;tody, withholding Writs of Election from Burroughs and
Towns, and &s;everal other ways; which if they are not Check'd
$ither by the King or the Lords, <HI>they are altogether Parties to the
Wrong,</HI> and the Subject is apparently injured.</P>
<P>The Lords may Err in Judicature, and deny Ju&s;tice to the Com|mons,
or delay it upon Punctillioes and &s;tudied Occa&s;ions, and if
neither the King nor the Commons take care to prevent it, Delin|quents
are excu&s;ed, and Criminals encouraged, <HI>and all are Guilty of
the Breach of Common Ju&s;tice.</HI></P>
<P>That to prevent this, it is ab&s;olutely nece&s;&s;ary that in Matters of
di&s;pute the Single Powers &s;hould be Governed by the Joint, and that
nothing &s;hould &s;o be in&s;i&s;ted upon as to break the Corre&s;pondence.</P>
<P>And that the Three &s;hould be directed by the Law; and where
that is &s;ilent, by Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>That every Per&s;on concern'd in the Law is in his Mea&s;ure a judge
of the Rea&s;on, and therefore in his proper place ought <HI>to be allowed
to give his Rea&s;on in Ca&s;e of Di&s;&s;ent.</HI></P>
<P>That every Single Power has an ab&s;olute Negative upon the Acts
of the Other; and if the People, who are without Doors, find Rea|&s;on
to Object, <HI>they may do it by Petition.</HI></P>
<P>But becau&s;e under pretence of Petitioning, Seditious and Turbu|lent
People may &s;oment Di&s;turbances, Tumults and Di&s;orders:
The Subjects Right of Petitioning being yet recogniz'd and pre|ferv'd,
the Circum&s;tances of &s;uch Petitions are regulated by Laws,
as to the Numbers and Qualities of the Per&s;ons Petitioning.</P>
<P>But the Laws have no where pre&s;crib'd the Petitioners to any
Form of Words, and therefore no pre$ence of Indecency of Expre&s;|&s;ion
can be &s;o Criminal as to be de&s;tructive of t$$ Con&s;titution; be|cau&s;e,
though it may de&s;erve the Re&s;entment of the Petitioned, yet
it is not an illegal Act, nor a Breach of any Law.</P>
<P>And yet the Repre&s;entative Body of the People ought not to be
Banter'd or Affronted neither, at the Will and Plea&s;ure of any pri|$yate
Per&s;on without Doors, who-finds Cau&s;e to Petition them.</P>
<P><PB N="5" REF="13">
But if any Expre&s;&s;ion be offen&s;ive to the Hou&s;e, it &s;eems Rea|&s;onable
that the Per&s;ons who are concerned therein &s;hould be
requir'd to explain them&s;elves And if upon &s;uch Explanation
the Hou&s;e find no Satisfaction as to the particular Affront, they
are at Liberty to proceed as the Law directs; but no otherwi&s;e.</P>
<P>And to me, the Silence of the Law in that Ca&s;e &s;eems to imply,
that rejecting the Petition is a Contempt due to any Indecency
of that Nature, and as much Re&s;entment as the Nature of the
Thing requires: But as to breaking in upon Per&s;onal Liberty,
which is a Thing the Law is &s;o tender of, and has made &s;o &s;trong
a Fence about, I dare not affirm 'tis a ju&s;tifiable Procedure; no,
not in the Hou&s;e of Commons.</P>
<P>It is alledged, That it has been practiced by all Parliaments;
which is to me far from an Argument to prove the Legality of it.</P>
<P>I think it may pa&s;s for a Maxim, That a Man cannot be Legally
puni&s;h'd for a Crime which there is no Law to pro&s;ecute. Now
&s;ince there is no Law to pro&s;ecute a Man for Indecency of Ex|pre&s;&s;ion
in a Petition to the Hou&s;e of Commons, it remains a
Doubt with me how they can be Legally puni&s;h'd.</P>
<P>Precedents are of U&s;e to the Hou&s;es of Parliament where the
Laws are &s;ilent, in Things relating to them&s;elves, and are doubt|le&s;s
a &s;ufficient Authority to act from. But whether any Prece|dent,
U&s;age or Cu&s;tom, of any Body of Men whatever, can
make a Thing Lawful which the Laws have expre&s;ly forbid, re|mains
a Doubt with me.</P>
<P>It were to be wi&s;h'd &s;ome of our Parliaments would think fit,
at one Time or another, to clear up the Point of the Authority
of the Hou&s;e of Commons, in Ca&s;e of Impri&s;oning &s;uch as are
not of their Hou&s;e, that having the Matter &s;tated by tho&s;e who
are the onely Expo&s;itors of our Laws, we might be troubled with
no more <HI>Legion Libels,</HI> to tell them what is, or is not, Legal in
their Proceedings.</P>
<P>The Good of the People Governed is the End of all Govern|ment,
and the Rea&s;on and Original of Governours; and upon
this Foundation it is that it has been the Practice of all Nations,
and of this in particular, That if the Male-Admini&s;tration of
Governours have extended to Tyranny and Oppre&s;&s;ion, to De|&s;truction
of Right and Ju&s;tice, overtlirowing the Con&s;titution,
and abu&s;ing the People, the People have thought it Lawful to
<PB N="6" REF="14">
Rea&s;&s;ume the Right of Government into their own Hands, and
to reduce their Governours to Rea&s;on.</P>
<P>The pre&s;ent Happy Re&s;toring of our Liberty and Con&s;titution
is owing to this Fundamental Maxim, according to a late Author,
<Q><L>&startq;That Kings when they de&s;cend to Tyranny,</L>
<L>Di&s;&s;olve the Bond, and leave the Subject free.&endq;</L>
<L>True born Engli&s;hman, P.</L></Q></P>
<P>If the People are Ju&s;tifiable in this Procedure again&s;t the King,
I hope I &s;mall not be Cen&s;ur'd if I &s;ay, That if any one &s;hould ask
me, whether they have not the &s;ame Right, in the &s;ame Ca&s;es, again&s;t
any of the Three Heads of the Con&s;titution, I dare not an&s;wer in
the Negative.</P>
<P>I may be allow'd to &s;uppo&s;e any Thing which is po&s;&s;ible; and I
will therefore venture to &s;uppo&s;e, That in the late King's Reign
the Hou&s;e of Commons, then fitting, had Voted the Re&s;toration
of Popery in <HI>England,</HI> in Compliance with the King's Inclination.</P>
<P>I doubt not but it had been Lawful for the <HI>Grand Juries, Ju|&s;tices
of the Peace,</HI> and <HI>Free-holders of any County,</HI> or of every
County, to have Petition'd the Hou&s;e of Commons not to pro|ceed
in giving up their Religion and Laws.</P>
<P>And in Ca&s;e of Refu&s;al there, they might Petition the Hou&s;e of
Lords not to have Pa&s;s'd &s;uch a Bill.</P>
<P>And in Ca&s;e of Refu&s;al there, they might Petition the King,
and put Him in Mind of His Coronation Engagement.</P>
<P>And in Ca&s;e of Refu&s;al to that Petition, they might Petition
the King again to Di&s;&s;olve the Parliament, or otherwi&s;e to protect
their Liberties and Religion.</P>
<P>And if all the&s;e Peaceable Applications fail'd, I doubt not but
they might A&s;&s;ociate for their Mutual Defence again&s;t any Inva|&s;ion
of their Liberties and Religion, and apply them&s;elves to any
Neighbouring Power or Potentate for A&s;&s;i&s;tance and Protection.</P>

<P><HI>Thirdly;</HI> This is Arguing from the Inferiour Court to the Parlia|ment

<HI>Fol.</HI> 4. where he had, as I &s;uppo&s;e, forgot that he had laid us down
this Rule.</P>
<P>&startq;When there is Occa&s;ion to Debate concerning the&s;e Superiour Powers
of King, Lords and Commons, we ma&s;t not argue like Lawyers in

<P><HI>Fourthly,</HI> But I am al&s;o informed, that the Ca&s;e is wrong too,

<P>And what has been the Engine that has led the Nation to it?
The Rea&s;on and Nature of the Thing. Rea&s;on governs Men when
they are Ma&s;ters of their Sences, as naturally as Fire flies upwards,
or Water de&s;cends.</P>
<P>For what is it that King, Lords and Commons a&s;&s;emble? 'Tis

<P>I grant 'tis rea&s;onable that every Branch &s;hould be ve&s;ted with

<P>But if they mu&s;t be ve&s;ted with Power, &s;ome Body mu&s;t re&s;t

di&s;tribute them. So that</P>
<P>There mu&s;t be &s;ome Power <HI>Prior</HI> to the Power of King, Lords
and Commons, from which, as the Streams from the Fountain, the
Power of King, Lords and Commons is derived.</P>
<P>And what are all the different Terms which State&s;men turn &s;o
often into fine Words to &s;erve their Ends; as, <HI>Rea&s;on of State, Pub|lick

Particulars had a Being.</HI> And from this Con&s;ideration it is, that &s;ome
who yet would be Oppo&s;ers of this Doctrine, &s;ay, <HI>when it &s;erves
their turn,</HI> that all the Great Offices which have the Title of <HI>Eng|land</HI>
annexed to them, ought to be Nominated and Approved by

That Power which is Original, is Superior; <HI>God is the Foun|tain

a Prior and Original of the Divine Power, <HI>that Original would
be God,</HI> and be Superiour; for all &s;ub&s;equent Power mu&s;t be &s;ub|ject
and inferiour to the precedent.</P>
<P>The Power ve&s;ted in the Three Heads of our Con&s;titution is
ve&s;ted in them by the People of <HI>England,</HI> who were a People before
there was &s;uch a thing as a Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>And the Nature of the Thing, is the Rea&s;on of the Thing: It was
ve&s;ted in them by the People, becau&s;e the People were the only Original
of their Power, being the only Power Prior to the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>For the publick Good of the&s;e People, a Con&s;titution and Govern|ment
was Originally Formed; from the mutual Con&s;ent of the&s;e
people the Powers and Authorities of this Con&s;titution are derived:
And for the pre&s;ervation of this Con&s;titution, and enabling it to an|&s;wer
the Ends of its In&s;titution in the be&s;t manner po&s;&s;ible, tho&s;e
Powers were divided.</P>
<P>The Second Maxim is a Rational Natural Con&s;equence of the
former, That at the <HI>final, Ca&s;ual, or any other</HI> Determination of
this Con&s;titution, the Powers are Di&s;&s;olv'd, and all Authority
mu&s;t derive <HI>de novo</HI> from the fir&s;t Fountain, Original and Cau&s;e
of all Con&s;titutions, <HI>the Governed.</HI></P>
<P>Now it cannot be &s;uppos'd this Original Fountain &s;hould give
up all its Waters, but that it re&s;erves a Power of &s;upplying the
Streams: Nor has the Streams any power to turn back upon the
Fountain, and invert its own Original. All &s;uch Motions are Ex|centrick
and Unnatural.</P>
<P>There mu&s;t always remain a Supream Power in the Original to
&s;upply, in Ca&s;e of the Di&s;&s;olution of Delegated Power.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>England</HI> have Delegated all the Executive Power
<HI>in the King,</HI> the Legi&s;lative in the <HI>King, Lords and Commons,</HI> the
Soveraign Judicature <HI>in the Lords,</HI> the Remainder is re&s;erv'd in them|&s;elves,
and not committed, no not to their Repre&s;entatives: All
Powers Delegated are to one Great End and Purpo&s;e, and no
other, and that is <HI>the Publick Good.</HI> If either or all the Branches
to whom this Power is Delegated invert the De&s;ign, the End of
their Power, the Right they have to that Power cea&s;es; and
they become Tyrants and U&s;urpers of a Power they have no
Right to.</P>

<P>But in <HI>England,</HI> the late Revolution is a particular In&s;tance of
the Exerci&s;e of this Power.</P>
<P>King <HI>James</HI> on the Approach of a Foreign Army, and the ge|neral
recour&s;e of the People to Arms, fled out of the Kingdom.
What mu&s;t the People of <HI>England</HI> do? They had no Rea&s;on to
run after him to be Govern'd there; there was no Body to call a
Parliament, &s;o the Con&s;titution was entirely Di&s;&s;olved.</P>
<P>The Original of Power, <HI>the People,</HI> A&s;&s;embled in Convention,
to con&s;ider of Delegating New Powers for their future Govern|ment,
and accordingly made a New Settlement of the Crown, a
New Declaration of Right, and a New Repre&s;entative of the
People; <HI>and &s;ome have thought they ought to have given a New
Sanction to all precedent Laws.</HI></P>
<P>It remains to argue from hence, But what Cour&s;e mu&s;t the
People of <HI>England</HI> take, if their Repre&s;entatives exerci&s;e the Power
intru&s;ted with them, to the Ruine of the Con&s;titution?</P>
<P>It has been advanced, That every Man mu&s;t &s;ubmit, and not
pre&s;ume to argue again&s;t it upon any Suppo&s;ition of Mi&s;manage|ment.</P>
<P>I
can &s;ee no Rea&s;on given to confirm &s;uch a Po&s;ition; for unle&s;s

not in the per&s;ons Repre&s;ented, it cannot be made out that there
ought to be no Complaint upon the &s;core of Mi&s;management.
It is not the De&s;ign of this Di&s;cour&s;e to le&s;&s;en the Authority of
Parliament: But all Power mu&s;t Centre &s;ome where. If it is in the
Three Branches of the Conftitution, 'tis there inherently and origi|nally,
or it is there by Deputation. If it be there by Deputation,
then there mu&s;t be a Power Deputing, and that mu&s;t be both <HI>Prtor,</HI>
and con&s;equently Superiour to the Deputed, <HI>as before.</HI></P>
<P>If we will come off of this, we mu&s;t fly to the old weak Re&s;uge
of a Power <HI>Jure Divino,</HI> a Doctrine which the mo&s;t &s;amed Pre|tenders

that which has been may be, &s;o that may be which never has been before.</HI></P>
<P>We have &s;een Parliaments comply with Kings to the Ruine of the
Nation; and we have &s;een Parliaments Quarrel with Kings, to the
Overturning of the Con&s;titution, Di&s;&s;olving the Hou&s;e of Lords, and
Suppre&s;&s;ing the Monarchy.</P>
<P>We have &s;een Parliaments concur &s;o with the Fate and Fortunes

Reinthroning alternately two Kings as often as Victory put power
into their Hands, I mean <HI>Henry</HI> the Sixth, and <HI>Edward</HI> the Fourth,
who were Kings and Pri&s;oners five or &s;ix times, and always the
Parliament complied with the Conquerors.</P>
<P>We have &s;een a Parliament of <HI>England</HI> confirm the U&s;urpation
of <HI>Richard</HI> the Third, the greate&s;t Tyrant and mo&s;t bloody Man
that ever <HI>England</HI> brought forth.</P>

a <HI>Popi&s;h Parliament</HI> pull down the Supremacy of <HI>Rome,</HI> and &s;et up
the King's; and afterwards &s;uppre&s;s all the Religious Hou&s;es in the

&s;uppre&s;s'd all the proceedings of Popery; and <HI>all was by Authority

than the Kingly.</P>
<P>Had Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> gone on to have Recogniz'd the Peoples Right,
to pre&s;erve their own Liberties in ca&s;e of faiulure in any, or in all the
Branches of the Con&s;tituted Power, he had compleated his <HI>Vindi|cation
of the Commons of England,</HI> which no Man could have done
better than him&s;elf.</P>
<P>If then upon the Subver&s;ion of the Laws, and Interruption of
Common Ju&s;tice, the Center of Power is in the People, <HI>a Fortiori.</HI>
The People are al&s;o concerned in every Degree of &s;uch a Subver&s;ion.</P>
<P>And 'tis the mo&s;t rea&s;onable thing in the World, that tho&s;e who
upon a total Subver&s;ion are the Sufferers, and have a Right to the
Re-e&s;tabli&s;hment, &s;hould have a Right to take Cognifance of any
Degree of Inva&s;ion made upon their Right, and which tends to that
general Subver&s;ion.</P>
<P>'Twould be Non&s;ence to &s;uppo&s;e, that which has all the Greater

<P><PB N="13" REF="21">
But I chu&s;e rather to put the Argument upon total Subver&s;ions of

again&s;t that Bug-bear, which &s;o many pretend to be frighted at <HI>a
Commonwealth.</HI></P>
<P>The <HI>Genius</HI> of this Nation has always appear'd to tend to a Mo|narchy,
a legal limited Monarchy; and having had in the late Re|volution
a full and uninterrupted Liberty, to Ca&s;t them&s;elves into
what Form of Government they pleas'd: There was not di&s;cover|ed
the lea&s;t Inclination in any Party towards a <HI>Commonwealth,</HI> tho'
the Treatment they met with from their la&s;t two Kings, had all in
it that could be, to put them out of Love with Monarchy.</P>
<P>A Commonwealth can never be introduc'd, but by &s;uch Inva&s;ions
of Right as mu&s;t make our pre&s;ent Con&s;tituted Government impra|cticable:
The Rea&s;on is, becau&s;e Men never willingly change for the
Wor&s;t; and the People of <HI>England</HI> enjoy more Freedom in our Regal,
than any People in the World can do ina Popular Government.</P>
<P>The People of <HI>England</HI>' can never chu&s;e a Commonwealth Go|vernment,
till they come to de&s;ire le&s;s Liberty than they now enjoy;
that is, till they come to be blind to their own Intere&s;t. 'Tis true,
Example is no Argument; but I might freely Appeal to the Friends
of the La&s;t Republick in <HI>England</HI> to an&s;wer this Que&s;tion.</P>
<P>Whether the People of <HI>England,</HI> during the &s;hort Government of
Parliament in <HI>England,</HI> which was erroneou&s;ly called a Common|wealth,
did, or whether they can under any Commonwealth Go|vernment,

than under the pre&s;ent Con&s;titution in its full and free Ex|erci&s;e,
uninterrupted by the Exce&s;&s;es of Kings evil Councellors, Par|ties
and Pa&s;&s;ions.</P>
<P>If any &s;hall pretend that the late Parliament is aimed at in this, I
hope I may have as much liberty to &s;uppo&s;e they are Mi&s;taken; <HI>for
the Days of Judging by</HI> Inuendo <HI>are at an end.</HI></P>
<P>If any thing &s;eem to lie that way, the Error mu&s;t be theirs who

<HI>if it does, they are welcome to wear it.</HI> For my part, I declare my

&s;aying, that What Power they have they receive from the People they
repre&s;ent; and, That &s;ome Powers do &s;till remain with the People, which

<P>Nor can I be &s;en&s;ible of offending if I &s;ay, that '<HI>Tis po&s;&s;ible for
even a Hou&s;e of Commons to be in the Wrong.</HI> 'Tis po&s;&s;ible for a

the&s;e Extreams to betray their Tru&s;t, and abu&s;e the People who en|tru&s;t
them: And if the People &s;hould have no Redre&s;s in &s;uch a
Ca&s;e, then were the Nation in the hazard of being ruined by their

Commons can Injure the People who intru&s;t them.</HI> There can be no
better way to demon&s;trate the po&s;&s;ibility of a thing, than by proving
that it has been already.</P>
<P>And we need go no farther back than to the Reign of King <HI>Charles</HI>
the Second, in which we have &s;een Li&s;ts of 180 Members who re|ceived
private Pen&s;ions from the Court; and if any Body &s;hall ask
whether that Parliament pre&s;erv'd the Ballance of Power in the
three Branches of our Con&s;titution, in the due di&s;tribution &s;ome have
mentioned, <HI>I am not afraid to an&s;wer in the Negative.</HI></P>
<P>And why even to this day are Gentlemen &s;o fond of &s;pending their
E&s;tates to &s;it in that Hou&s;e, that Ten thou&s;and Pounds has been
&s;pent at a time to be Cho&s;en, and now that way of procuring Ele|ctions
is at an end, <HI>private Briberies</HI> and Clande&s;tine Contrivances

<P>If then the&s;e things are po&s;&s;ible, it &s;eems to me not &s;o improper
for the People, who are the Original and End of the Con&s;titution, and

is &s;o great, as it drowns the Complaints of the People; but I dare
&s;ay none of the People of <HI>England</HI> would be again&s;t having due Re|&s;entments
&s;hown, and legal Puni&s;hments inflicted with impartial Ju|&s;tice,
where the Per&s;ons appear Guilty: But if Enquity after Di&s;|orders
at Home &s;hould delay taking care of our Safety Abroad; if
private Cla&s;hings and Di&s;putes between Parties and Intere&s;ts &s;hould
take up the Hours which are due to the Emergency of Foreign
Affairs, the People of <HI>England</HI> will be very ill &s;erv'd; and the Per|&s;ons,
whoever they are concerned, will be able to give but a &s;orry
account to the Country that employ'd them of the Tru&s;t they had
committed to them: Not that Delinquents &s;hould not be Puni&s;h'd,
or Evil Mini&s;ters Impeach'd, but, as our Saviour &s;ays in another
Ca&s;e, <HI>The&s;e things ye ought to have done, and not have the other left
undone.</HI></P>
<P>What &s;hall we then &s;ay to the manner of fixing Guilt upon a
Per&s;on or a Party by Vote. That the Lords denying a free Con|ference
was a Delay of Ju&s;tice, and tended to de&s;troy the good Cor|re&s;pondence,
<HI>&amp;c.</HI> and refu&s;ing to proceed to the Tryal of one Im|peach'd
Lord, becau&s;e another Lord, not Impeach'd, had affronted
the Hou&s;e.</P>
<P><PB N="16" REF="24">
Truly I &s;hall venture to &s;ay nothing of it but this, That the Cla&s;h|ings
and Di&s;agreement between the two Hou&s;es are things our Ene|mies
rejoyc'd at, and the People of <HI>England</HI> were very &s;orry for.
Who are in the right of it Sir <HI>H. M.</HI> mu&s;t an&s;wer for me, who &s;ays,
<HI>It is not to be imagin'd that a Majority of &s;o numerous a Body of Gen|tlemen

morrow Morning at <HI>Traro</HI> in <HI>Cornwall.</HI></P>
<P>If he means that it is not probable, I readily allow it; but if he
means that 'tis not po&s;&s;ible, I cannot agree, for the Rea&s;ons and Ex|amples
afore&s;aid: And if it be but po&s;&s;ible, 'tis not rea&s;onable the
Liberty and Safety of <HI>England</HI> &s;hould be expo&s;ed even to a po&s;&s;ibi|lity
of a Di&s;a&s;ter; and therefore Rea&s;on and Ju&s;tice allows, that
when all Delegated Powers fail or expire, when Governours de|vour
the People they &s;hould protect; And when Parliaments, <HI>if
ever that unhappy time &s;hall come again,</HI> &s;hould be either de&s;troy'd,
or, which is as bad, be Corrupted, and betray the People they Re|pre&s;ent,
the People them&s;elves, who are the Original of all Dele|gated
Power, have an undoubted Right to defend their Lives, Li|berties,
Properties, Religion and Laws, again&s;t all manner of In|va&s;ion
or Treachery, be it Foreign or Dome&s;tick; the Con&s;titution
is Di&s;&s;olv'd, and the Laws of Nature and Rea&s;on act of Cour&s;e, ac|cording
to the late Author quoted before.</P>
<Q><L>&startq;The Government's ungirt when Ju&s;tice dies,</L>
<L>And Con&s;titutions are <HI>non Entities:</HI></L>
<L>The Nation's all a Mob; there's no &s;uch thing</L>
<L>As Lords and Commons, Parliament or King.</L>
<L>A great promi&s;cuous Croud the <HI>Hydra</HI> lies,</L>
<L>Till Laws revive and mutual Contract ties,</L>
<L>A <HI>Chaos</HI> free to chu&s;e for their own &s;hare</L>
<L>What Ca&s;e of Government they plea&s;e to wear.</L>
<L>If to a King they do the Reins commit,</L>
<L>All Men are bound in Con&s;cience to &s;ubmit.</L>
<L>But then that King mu&s;t by his Oath a&s;&s;ent</L>
<L>To Po&s;talata's of the Government:</L>
<L>Which if he breaks he cuts off the Intail,</L>
<L>And Power retreats to its Original.&mdash;&endq;</L></Q>
<Q>True Engli&s;h-Man, p. 47.</Q>
<P>It may be Objected; But who are the&s;e People to whom Power mu&s;t
thus Retreat? And who have the Original Right in their Hands? It
mu&s;t be the whole People. If there be one Negative, every one having
an equal Right, the real Claim of Power is Imperfect: And &s;ince there
can be no general Collective Meeting of the whole Community, there can
<PB N="17" REF="25">
be no Execution of their Power; and therefore this does not ju&s;tifie a
few of that Body in the name of the re&s;t, to Execute any part of
that Power.</P>
<P>This may be An&s;wered; though upon a Di&s;&s;olution of Govern|ment
all the People collectively cannot be enquired of as to what
they will have done, yet one Negative ought not to Interrupt the
whole.</P>
<P>I'll &s;uppo&s;e a general Di&s;&s;olution of Government in any Country,
&s;uch as was &s;een in this Nation at the la&s;t Revolution.</P>
<P>The People a&s;&s;embled in a Univer&s;al Mob to take the Right of Go|vernment
upon them&s;elves, are not to be &s;uppo&s;ed to give their
per&s;onal Suffrages to every Article, but they may agree to a Con|vention
of &s;uch Per&s;ons as they think fit to Intru&s;t, to Con&s;titute <HI>de
Novo,</HI> and may Delegate their Power, or part of it to &s;uch a Con|vention;
and in &s;uch Ca&s;e a general Concurrence is to be &s;uppos'd,
unle&s;s there be a publick Di&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>Now &s;uppo&s;e the general Collective Body of the People &s;hould
not unanimou&s;ly agree, 'tis own'd the Power could not be univer|&s;ally
Delegated, and there a Divi&s;ion would follow; but in &s;uch
Ca&s;e, tho&s;e who Di&s;&s;ented from &s;uch an Agreement, mu&s;t declare
their Di&s;&s;ent, and agree to any other Form of Government for them|&s;elves,
and &s;o divide from the other Body, and if they do not divide,
they in effect do not Di&s;&s;ent.</P>
<P>But then this Divi&s;ion mu&s;t be before any Members are Delegated
by them to Convene.</P>
<P>For Example:</P>
<P>Suppo&s;e the Freeholders in <HI>Cornwall</HI> in &s;uch a Ca&s;e &s;hould &s;ay,
We do not approve of your deputing Men to meet and con&s;ult of a
new Government and Con&s;titution, we are re&s;olved to be govern'd
by <HI>&s;uch a Man</HI> of our own Country.</P>
<P>This Re&s;olution being again&s;t no Law, and that County having
&s;ent no Members to repre&s;ent them, and to join with the re&s;t of the
Body, they cannot be legally di&s;turb'd, or puni&s;h'd, or forc'd to
Unite with the re&s;t of the Nation.</P>
<P>Such a Divi&s;ion might be look'd upon as a Misfortune to the
General Body, and unkind in the County or part dividing from the
re&s;t, but in the nature of the thing it could not be Unju&s;t.</P>
<P><PB N="18" REF="26">
For as much as any Body of Men are at Liberty, upon the Di&s;&s;o|lution
of former Contracts, to be Governed by &s;uch Laws and Per|&s;ons,
and in &s;uch manner as they &s;hall think fit.</P>
<P>Yet is there no fear of &s;uch a Divi&s;ion in a Country &s;o depending
on its &s;everal Parts as this is, becau&s;e the re&s;t would render them &s;o
unea&s;ie, that Intere&s;t would compel them to comply.</P>
<P>I do not place this Right upon the Inhabitants, but upon the
<HI>Freeholders;</HI> the <HI>Freeholders</HI> are the proper Owners of the Country:
It is their own, and the other Inhabitants are but Sojourners, like
Lodgers in a Hou&s;e, and ought to be &s;ubject to &s;uch Laws as the
Freeholders impo&s;e upon them, or el&s;e they mu&s;t remove; becau&s;e
the Freeholders having a Right to the Land, the other have no right
to live there but upon &s;ufferance.</P>
<P>In former Days the Freehold gave a Right of Government to
the Freeholder, and Va&s;&s;alage and Villinage was deriv'd from this
Right, that every Man who will live in my Land &s;hall be my Ser|vant;
if he wont, let him go about his Bu&s;ine&s;s, and live &s;ome|where
el&s;e: And 'tis the &s;ame &s;till in right rea&s;oning.</P>
<P>And I make no que&s;tion but that Property of Land is the be&s;t
Title to Government in the World; and if the King was univer&s;al
Landlord, he ought to be Univer&s;al Governour of Right, and the
People &s;o living on his Lands ought to obey him, or go off of his
Premi&s;es.</P>
<P>And if any &s;ingle Man in <HI>England</HI> &s;hould at any time come to be
Landlord of the whole Freehold of <HI>England,</HI> he could indeed have
no Right to Di&s;po&s;&s;e&s;s the King, till the pre&s;ent Legal Settlement of
the Crown fail'd, becau&s;e it was &s;ettled by tho&s;e that had then a
Right to &s;ettle it.</P>
<P>But he would immediately be the full Repre&s;entative of all the
Counties in <HI>England,</HI> and might Elect him&s;elf Knight of the Shire
for every County, and the Sheriff of every County mu&s;t Return
him accordingly.</P>
<P>He would have all the Baronies and Titles of Honour which are
entail'd upon E&s;tates devolv'd upon him, and upon any Expiration
of the Settlement would be King by natural Right.</P>
<P>And he would be King upon larger Terms than ever any Man
was legally King of <HI>England;</HI> for he would be King by inherent
Right of Property.</P>
<P><PB N="19" REF="27">
When therefore I am &s;peaking of the Right of the People, I
would be under&s;tood of the Freeholders, for all the other Inhabitants,
live upon Sufferance, and either are the Freeholders Servants, or having
Money to pay Rent live upon Conditions, and have no Title to
their living in <HI>England,</HI> other than as Servants, but what they mu&s;t
pay for.</P>
<P>Upon this foot it is that to this Day our Law &s;uffers not a Fo|reigner
to Purcha&s;e any of the Freeholds of <HI>England:</HI> For if a Fo|reigner
might Purcha&s;e, your Neighbours (having Money to &s;pare)
might come and buy you out of your own Country, and take Po&s;&s;e&s;|&s;ion
by a legal and indi&s;putable Right.</P>
<P>This Original Right was the fir&s;t Foundation of the &s;everal Te|nures
of Land in <HI>England;</HI> &s;ome held of the King, &s;ome of the
Lord, &s;ome by Knight Service, Soccage, and the like, and &s;ome
were called Freeholds. The Lords of Mannors had their Homages
and their Services from their Tenants, as an Acknowledgment that
the Right of the Land gave a certain Right of Government to the
Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or over all the Tenants and Inhabitants.</P>
<P>And as a thing which will put this Argument out of all que&s;tion.
The Right to Lands, Mannors, and Lord&s;hips was not Originally
a Right granted by Patents from Kings or Acts of Parliament, but
a natural Right of Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion handed down by Cu&s;tom and ancient
U&s;age, as the Inheritance from the &s;till more ancient Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors,
and Pre&s;cription, as the Lawyers call it, or U&s;age time out of mind,
is to this Day allow'd to be a &s;ufficient Title in &s;everal Ca&s;es, where
Conveyances, Deeds, Charters, and Writings of E&s;tates are &s;ilent,
e&s;pecially as to Buttings and Boundings of Land, Highways, Foot|paths,
Water Cour&s;es, Bridges, and the like.</P>
<P>This Right, as all Right Originally, is Founded upon Rea&s;on:
For it would be highly Unrea&s;onable, that tho&s;e People who have no
&s;hare of the Hou&s;e &s;hould live in it whether he that built it will or
no. No Per&s;on has any Right to live in <HI>England,</HI> but they to whom
<HI>England</HI> belongs; the Freeholders of <HI>England</HI> have it in po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion;
<HI>England</HI> is their own, and no Body has any thing to do here but
them&s;elves.</P>
<P>If they permit other People to live here, well and good, but no
Man but a Freeholder lives here upon any Terms but <HI>permi&s;&s;es Supe|riorum,</HI>
and he pays Rent for his Licence to live here.</P>
<P>Thus the Liberties and Privileges of Towns and Corporations are
founded upon Acts of Parliament to confirm Charters or Grants from
the Crown, by which the Freeholders give their Con&s;ent that &s;uch
<PB N="20" REF="28">
and &s;uch Bodies of Men living in &s;uch Towns, &s;hall enjoy certain
Privileges in Con&s;ideration of their being &s;o con&s;iderably &s;erviceable
to the Nation, by paying Taxes, maintaining the poor, by Manu|factures,
Trade, and the like, notwith&s;tanding they are not po&s;&s;e&s;s'd
of any part of the Freehold.</P>
<P>And 'tis ob&s;ervable, the King cannot give this Privilege, &s;o as to
enable any of the&s;e Corporations to &s;end Repre&s;entatives to Parlia|ment.
None but the Freeholders of <HI>England</HI> (and &s;uch Towns in
Conjunction) to whom the Freeholders have already granted &s;uch
Privilege, can give a Qualification of &s;uch a Nature, as is a receiving
them into an equal &s;tate of Privilege with a Freeholder.</P>
<P>Every Man's Land is his own Property; and 'tis a Tre&s;pa&s;s in
the Law for another Man to come upon his Ground without his
Con&s;ent. If the Freeholders &s;hould all agree, That &s;uch a Man &s;hall
not come upon their Land; That they will not Lett him a Hou&s;e for
his Money; That who&s;e Land &s;oever he &s;ets his Foot on, the Owner
&s;hall Indict him for a Tre&s;pa&s;s, as by Law he may, the Man mu&s;t
fly the Nation of Cour&s;e.</P>
<P>Thus the Freeholders having a Right to the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of <HI>England,</HI>
the Rea&s;on mu&s;t be good that they mu&s;t have the &s;ame Right to the
Government of them&s;elves, that they have to the Government of the
re&s;t of the Inhabitants; and <HI>that there can be no Legal Poter in</HI>
England, <HI>but what has its Original in the Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ors; for Property is the
Foundation of Power.</HI></P>
<P>I am not undertaking to find fault with our Con&s;titutions, tho'
I do not grant neither, that it is capable of no Amendment; but I
would endeavour to make way, by retreating to Originals, for every
Member to perform its proper Function, in order to put the general
Body into its regular Motion.</P>
<P>For as in the natural Body, if any Member, either by Contraction
of the Organ, Di&s;location, or other Accident, fails in the perfor|mance
of its proper Duty, the Locomotive Faculty is either inter|rupted,
and the Body di&s;torted, or at lea&s;t the regularity of Natural
Motion is invaded: So in the Body Politick, if one Branch of the ge|neral
Union err, and that Error is not Corrected, the whole Con|&s;titution
&s;uffers a &s;hock, and there is an In&s;raction of the general
Order.</P>
<P>The Excellency of our Con&s;titution con&s;i&s;ts of the <HI>Symitry of
Parts; and the Ballance of Power;</HI> and if this Ballance be broken,
one Part grows too great for the other, and the whole is put into
Confu&s;ion.</P>
<P><PB N="21" REF="29">
To give &s;ome In&s;tances of this, 'twill be needful to enter a little
into Hi&s;tory, and we need not go far to inform our &s;elves, that
there has been a Time when the weakne&s;s of our Con&s;titution has
appeared.</P>
<P>Our Con&s;titution, when all the fine things in the World have been
&s;aid of it, is not impregnable, when Power has been thrown wholly
into one Scale, the other has always been trampled under Foot, and
overthrown by it.</P>
<P>The Regal Power under King <HI>Charles</HI> the Fir&s;t, over-Ballanc'd the
Lords and Commons, to the invading the Right of Levying Taxes
ve&s;ted wholly in the Parliament, and to the di&s;continuing Parlia|ments
for fourteen Years, and the many Convul&s;ions the Con&s;titution
felt in that time, is too melancholy a Subject to reflect upon.</P>
<P>The Hou&s;e of Commons in the next Settlement over-Ballanc'd
the Lords, and Power being added to one &s;ide, to&s;s'd the Upper
Hou&s;e quite out of the Scale, ab&s;olutely Annihilated the very being
of the Peers <HI>as a Hou&s;e,</HI> and voted them out of the Con&s;titution.</P>
<P>By the Re&s;toration the Con&s;titution return'd to its Original, and
the Ballance was pois'd again: What attempts have &s;ince been made
to overthrow it, are needle&s;s to be in&s;i&s;ted upon, but the nature of
the thing leads me to make one Remark, That if the King can do no
Wrong, nor is not puni&s;hable or blamable by our Con&s;titution, but
the Mini&s;tery, as a late Author has very clearly &s;et down. Then
we have acted &s;trangely in the late Revolution; That the Mini|&s;tery
of the late Reign, <HI>for who&s;e Misbehaviour we thought we had a
ju&s;t Right to call in Foreign Aid, and to &s;uppre&s;s who&s;e exorbitant Power
we took up Arms again&s;t our Prince,</HI> &s;hould not only not be puni&s;h'd
as they de&s;erv'd, but be &s;till capable of acting in the Mini&s;tery again,
and of repre&s;enting in Parliament that very People they had Betray'd.</P>
<P>Not that I am of &s;ome Peoples Opinion neither, who think the
late King had hard mea&s;ure in being Depos'd, when he was
really not accountable. For I pre&s;ume I may affirm, That the De|po&s;ing
King <HI>James</HI> was founded upon his De&s;erting the Nation, not
his Male-admini&s;tration; for had he continued in <HI>England</HI> you might
po&s;&s;ibly have &s;ubdu'd him, and took him Pri&s;oner, but there had been
no room for Tran&s;po&s;ing the Crown while he had been alive.</P>
<P>And 'tis allow'd by all, that tho&s;e Per&s;ons who advi&s;ed him to
quit the Kingdom by flying out of it, either wilfully betray'd him,
or very ignorantly gave him the only Council which could com|pleat
his Ruine.</P>
<P>How then it comes to pa&s;s that tho&s;e evil Mini&s;ters have arriv'd
to Impunity for what was pa&s;t, and again to be tru&s;ted both in the
<PB N="22" REF="30">
Court and in the Parliament with the Peoples Liberties, <HI>is a My&s;tery
pa&s;t our reaches.</HI></P>
<P>If I had no Name my &s;elf, I would &s;et down theirs; or if I had a
Pre&s;s in the Clouds to Print their Practices, the World &s;hould not be
Ignorant; but &s;ince 'tis not &s;o, I &s;hall only &s;ay as our Saviour &s;aid of
&s;ome Body el&s;e, <HI>By their Works ye &s;hall know them.</HI></P>
<P>The&s;e are the Men who Cry loude&s;t again&s;t the pre&s;ent Mini&s;tery,
and on all Occations make u&s;e of the pretence of <HI>Liberty</HI> to animate
the Nation again&s;t not only the pre&s;ent, but again&s;t every Mini|&s;tery
by which the publick Affairs &s;hall be manag'd, and again&s;t
the King him&s;elf. The &s;ame Men who in former Days Cried up a
Popi&s;h Army in a profound Peace, the very &s;ame now Cried down
a Prote&s;tant Army in time of Danger. The very &s;ame Men who
could dige&s;t the ab&s;olute Power of ruining our Liberty and Religion,
being ve&s;ted in a Popi&s;h King, were the fir&s;t and forwarde&s;t that
dur&s;t not tru&s;t a Prote&s;tant King with Forces enough to defend us till
Peace was better E&s;tabli&s;h'd, but have by that means, according to
their Hearts de&s;ire, laid us and all <HI>Europe</HI> under a nece&s;&s;ity of Arming
again to maintain that Peace, which 'twas then in our power to
have maintain'd.</P>
<P>For I am free to &s;ay 'twas not the Treaty of Partition which &s;o
much run the <HI>Spaniards</HI> upon giving them&s;elves up to the <HI>French,</HI> as
$t was the de&s;picable Figure the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Forces were reduced to,
which made the <HI>French</HI> King bold to take po&s;&s;e&s;&s;ion of the <HI>Spani&s;h</HI> Mo|narchy,
which had &s;ome, I do not &s;ay all our Forces been continued
but a year or two longer, he would not have ventur'd to have done.</P>
<P>And yet all the&s;e Forces might have been &s;ubjected &s;o ab&s;olutely to
Parliamentary Power, as if they had been their own; for the King
never denied them any Security they de&s;ired, and &s;o they might
have been Disbanded as ea&s;ily now as then.</P>
<P>Nor do I think that in this Di&s;cour&s;e I can be &s;uppo&s;ed to favour
that Party, <HI>if there be &s;uch a Party, which indeed I que&s;tion,</HI> who
would Govern this Nation by the help of a Standing Army; but I
mu&s;t be allowed to lay down this for a Maxim, That any Force as
&s;hall be agreed to by Con&s;ent of Parliament is Legal, and &s;ome Force
may at &s;ome particular times be nece&s;&s;ary, of which the Parliament
are the only Judges.</P>
<P>Still I allow that of this Power &s;o derived from Property, the <HI>Hou&s;e
of Commons</HI> are the Abridgment; they are <HI>the Freeholders of</HI> England
<HI>in M$nature;</HI> to them all needful Powers and Privileges are commit|ted,
to make them capable of acting for the People they Repre&s;ent;
<HI>and, Extremities excepted, they are our la&s;t Re&s;ort:</HI> But if they employ
<PB N="23" REF="31">
tho&s;e Privileges and Powers again&s;t the People, the rea&s;on of the&s;e
Powers is de&s;troy'd, the End is inverted, and the Power cea&s;e of cour&s;e.</P>
<P>From hence 'tis rea&s;onable to give them In&s;tructions; and though
they are not conditionally Cho&s;en as to their In&s;tructions. Yet they
ought in Honour to think them&s;elves under equal Obligation to
&s;tand by tho&s;e In&s;tructions.</P>
<P>In&s;tructions to Members are like the Power given to an Arbitrator,
in which though he is le&s;t fully and freely to act, yet 'tis in Confidence
of his Honour that he will think him&s;elf bound by the Directions he
receives from the Person for whom he acts.</P>
<P>If an Arbitrator Inverts the De&s;ign of his Principal, he de&s;troys
the end of his Election, and is &s;ure never to be entru&s;ted again.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> are our Sanctuary again&s;t, the Oppr&s;&s;ion of
Princes, the Nations Trea&s;ures, and the Defenders of their Liber|ties;
but all the&s;e Titles &s;ignifie, that at the &s;ame time they are the
Nations Servants.</P>
<P>The <HI>Hou&s;e of Commons</HI> al&s;o are Mortal, as a Hou&s;e; a King may
Di&s;&s;olve them, they may die and be extinct; but the Power of the
People has a kind of Eternity with re&s;pect to Politick Duration: Par|liaments
may cea&s;e, but the People remain; for them they were
originally made, by them they are continued and renewed, from
them they receive their Power, and to them in rea&s;on they ought to
be accountable.</P>

<HEAD>The Conclu&s;ion.</HEAD>
<P>THE Di&s;&s;olution of the la&s;t Parliament has been &s;ub&s;equent to
the Writing the&s;e Sheets, and two Ob&s;ervations fall our &s;o
naturally on this occa&s;ion, that I cannot but conclude this Subject
with them.</P>
<P>That both His Maje&s;ty and the whole Nation have very happily
given their Approbation to the Po&s;itions here laid down.</P>
<P>It cannot be doubted but that the Language of the Addre&s;&s;es of the
People pre&s;ented to his Maje&s;ty, upon the Indignity offer'd him
by the <HI>French</HI> King has in general a Di&s;like included in them of
the Management of their late Repre&s;entatives; and tho' it is a new
thing, yet it is plain that their Proceedings in general have been
D$&s;obliging to the Nation.</P>
<P>There was no need to expre&s;s in words at length, <HI>before al&s;o
His Maje&s;ty's Intentions were known,</HI> that they de&s;ire him to Di&s;|&s;olve
the pre&s;ent Parliament. Good Manners required, that
they &s;hould not &s;o plainly lead His Maje&s;ty in what he was
<PB N="24" REF="32">
to be the Author of; be&s;ides, the Parliament was in Being, and
the illegal Arbitiary U&s;age of the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Gentlemen fre&s;h in the
Memory of the People. But what is the meaning of the following
Expre&s;&s; $word$ the Addre&s;&s;es? <HI>If Your Maje&s;ty plea&s;e to entru&s;t us with
$span$ Parliament; When Your Maje&s;ty &s;hall be graciou&s;ly
$span$ Parliament; In Conjunction with a Parliament;</HI> and
$span$ would the Addre&s;&s;ors, have us, or have the King to
$span$ Expre&s;&s;ions, but that the People finding them|$$$$
$word$ by the Proceedings of their Repre&s;entatives, and the
Nation in $word$ of being abu&s;ed and betray'd to the Inva&s;ions of the
<HI>French,</HI> by the Illegal and Arbitrary De&s;igns of a Party in the
Hou&s;e, have recour&s;e to his Maje&s;ty, to depo&s;e <HI>for them</HI> a Power
which they &s;aw going to be mi&s;applied to the Ruine of tho&s;e from
whom and for whom it was appointed.</P>
<P>Nor was this any thing but what was &s;een and known before; all
the&s;e Addre&s;&s;es are the Legitimate Off-&s;pring of the <HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Peti|tion;
and had not the Freeholders been aw'd by the ill u&s;age of the
<HI>Kenti&s;h</HI> Gentlemen, the whole Nation had then as unanimou&s;ly Pe|tion'd
the Hou&s;e, as they have now Addre&s;s'd His Maje&s;ty.</P>
<P>This is evident from the Tenour, and yet undi&s;covered Original
of the <HI>Legion Paper;</HI> the Contents of which had &s;o much plain Truth
of Fact, and Truth of Law, that the Hou&s;e &s;tood Convicted in the
plain Con&s;ternation the Contents of it threw them in; <HI>and which
I could give a better Hi&s;tory of, if it were needful,</HI> by which they
gave a full a&s;&s;ent to the Right of the People.</P>
<P>But beyond all this is His Maje&s;ty's Proclamation, wherein, ac|cording
to Truth, Rea&s;on, and the Nature of the Thing, His Ma|je&s;ty
has graciou&s;ly given a Sanction to the natural Right of his
People, proclaiming from the <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Throne, of which he is the
mo&s;t Rightful Po&s;&s;e&s;&s;or by the Voice of the People, that ever &s;at
on it.</P>
<P>That when the People of <HI>England</HI> do univer&s;ally expre&s;s their
Re&s;olution to do what &s;hould or ought to be de&s;ired of good <HI>Engli&s;h-Men</HI>
and Prote&s;tants,<NOTE N="&ast;" PLACE="marg">See his Ma|je&s;ty's Procla|mation for Di&s;|&s;olving the Parliament.</NOTE> <HI>It is rea&s;onable to give them an Opportunity to
cho&s;e &s;uch Per&s;ons to repre&s;ent them in Parliament, as they may judge mo&s;t
likely to bring to effect their ju&s;t and pious Purposes.</HI></P>
<P>The Words need no Comment, they contain in them a glorious
Recognition from the Re&s;torer of <HI>Engli&s;h</HI> Liberty, and unexampled
Te&s;timony to the rea&s;onablene&s;s of tho&s;e ju&s;t Rights which, <HI>though
former Kings, blinded by Ambition, have endeavour'd to &s;uppre&s;s,</HI>
His pre&s;ent Maje&s;ty, according to his fir&s;t Declaration and continued
Practice, has accounted it his Chief Honour to pre&s;erve, and which
we doubt not he will hand down unbroken to our Po&s;terity.</P>
