<HEAD>PROLOGUE.</HEAD>
<LG>
<L>DEEP in a labyrinth, remote from view,</L>
<L>Fame's temple &s;tands, and Fa&s;hion holds the clue:</L>
<L>Before the entrance rang'd, a &s;uppliant band</L>
<L>Of candidates invoke her guiding hand:</L>
<L>In bur&s;ts the throng, a thou&s;and different ways</L>
<L>They &s;pread, wind, double thro' the puzzling maze:</L>
<L>Vain labor his who on him&s;elf relies,</L>
<L>Where none but Fa&s;hion's favorites gain the prize!</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Sad omen for our poet! who has cho&s;e</L>
<L>The narrow groveling path of humble pro&s;e;</L>
<L>A path indeed, which Moore and Lillo trode,</L>
<L>And reach'd Parna&s;&s;us by the bridle road:</L>
<L>Brambles and thorns oppo&s;e, and at our &s;ide</L>
<L>Nature alone, and &s;he a naked guide.</L>
<L>Patrons of nature, from your tears impart</L>
<L>Balm to her wounds, and heal her at your heart.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Now parody has vented all its &s;pite,</L>
<L>Let tragedy re&s;ume her antient right:</L>
<L>When Britain's lion roars in martial mood,</L>
<L>Throw to the kingly bea&s;t a &s;op of blood;</L>
<L>Loud in his ear your tragic thunders roll,</L>
<L>And rou&s;e the mighty terrors of his &s;oul:</L>
<L>When peace, with every liberal &s;cience join'd,</L>
<L>Decrees a joyful &s;abbath to mankind,</L>
<L>Let comedy re&s;tore the court of wit,</L>
<L>And open-a new &s;e&s;&s;ions in the pit.</L>
</LG>
<LG>
<L>Pageants and pantomimes have &s;pent their rage,</L>
<L>And emptied the whole wardrobe on the &s;tage:</L>
<L>Lord Mayors of London clubb'd with Gods of Greece,</L>
<L>And Bi&s;hop Blaize comb'd Ja&s;on's golden fleece;</L>
<L>Whil&s;t &s;lip&s;hod taylors on their tre&s;&s;el boards,</L>
<L>Of the Nine Mu&s;es &s;ate the cro&s;s-legg'd lords;</L>
<L>Let a plain bard, in &s;pite of Fa&s;hion, aim</L>
<L>By Nature's aid to find his way to fame:</L>
<L>To his dome&s;tic tale incline your ear,</L>

<P>DID ever man mi&s;take his happi|ne&s;s as I have done? am I by na|ture fitted for a hu&s;band? am I by temper qua|lified to be a game&s;ter? and yet (a plague upon my folly!) I am both: in both I've doubled &s;takes, and play'd the lo&s;ing game; married a wife for money, and a wife for love; and now nor love nor money will get rid of either: upon my right hand and my left a plague; over|head ruin impends; under-foot lurks di&s;covery. A &s;ituation that admits no choice, but choice of mi&s;eries. As to my Lady Davenant here, if
<PB N="2" REF="5">
ever man was puni&s;h'd in a faultle&s;s wife, it is my fate to be that man; with beauty to attract, affections to a&s;&s;i&s;t temptation, &s;till &s;he &s;tands upon a rock of virtue; nor can I, by the narrowe&s;t &s;earch, explore a crack or cranny, where the &s;lighte&s;t levity might enter, to throw down her barriers, and make way for my e&s;cape:&mdash;when a wife's indi&s;cretion will not &s;ave me, well may I rail at fortune; 'tis hard to lo&s;e upon a ca&s;t, where every chance was in my favour.&mdash;Now, Paget, before I talk to you, &s;hut the door.</P>
<STAGE><HI>Enter</HI> Paget, <HI>and &s;huts the door.</HI></STAGE>
<P>What have you di&s;cover'd in Lady Davenant &s;ince we la&s;t conferr'd?</P>

<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Where has &s;he been? whom has &s;he &s;een? what has &s;he done?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>The journal of one day is the journal of her life: if I had the eyes of a hawk (and mine are none of the dulle&s;t) I could not &s;py a flaw in Lady Davenant.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Incredible! Are not you an at|torney, and is not &s;he a woman? have not I &s;et you as a &s;py upon her per&s;on; cas'd the body of a lawyer in the livery of a &s;ervant; and, after three months pa&s;t and more, will you per&s;uade me, that you have di&s;covered, what the world never knew, a wife without a flaw? I'll not believe if.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="3" REF="6">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Why then, my Lord, you mu&s;t ev'n &s;trip my livery off my back, and di&s;mi&s;s me to my parchments.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>You will find flaws enough in them: of this I'm &s;ure, if any thing can outwit a law|yer, it mu&s;t be the devil; therefore, Paget, I conclude again&s;t her Lady&s;hip's &s;anctity. What do you tell me? has this great city lo&s;t its temp|tations, or reform'd its morals? There are a hundred fine men of the town, who &s;ay &s;he is the fine&s;t woman in it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes; and &s;wear it too: but &s;he won't believe 'em.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>She was credulous enough, when I told her &s;o.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twas a great weakne&s;s; but &s;he is wi&s;er than &s;he was.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Does Sir Harry Harlow make no way? He is a fa&s;hionable man, and came on with all the gallantry of a Frenchman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, and went off like a Frenchman; he'll not rally any more; we have orders never to admit him&mdash;&s;he is in frequent conver&s;ation with your &s;on.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I have remark'd it, and &s;hall &s;top their interviews.</P>

<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>She has been collecting a &s;um&mdash;</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>What is that for?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>That's more than I can tell: I &s;old &s;ome trinkets for her of her uncle's giving, and exchanged &s;ome money into notes this morning.</P>
</SP>
<PB N="4" REF="7">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I paid her quarter's pin-money but ye&s;terday:&mdash;this mu&s;t be look'd into.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>Yes, we may look; but it is &s;eeking for day-light with a dark-lanthorn: malice can|not &s;py a fault in her; mi&s;chief cannot make one; and if I might offer my advice, it &s;hould be to de&s;i&s;t from any further pains in the at|tempt: 'tis merely lo&s;s of labour, take my word for it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>To &s;ay the truth, I begin to be of your opinion; but till a better plan can be &s;truck out, we mu&s;t per&s;i&s;t in this: you know my rea&s;ons, Paget; you alone, of all mankind, are in the &s;ecret of that fatal &s;tep, which trains me on in infamy and error. If Lady Davenant was in fact, as &s;he is in law, my only wife, I would not act as now; but whil&s;t that &s;econd marriage in Flanders with Mi&s;s Dormer draws off my heart, and keeps me under terror of di&s;covery, if I can't find occa&s;ion for a divorce, I mu&s;t make it.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Tis plain your pa&s;&s;ion for Mi&s;s Dor|mer &s;till &s;ub&s;i&s;ts, el&s;e her per&s;ua&s;ion of your death, her ignorance of your name and &s;tation, and the precautions we have taken to prevent di&s;covery, make the&s;e mea&s;ures needle&s;s.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I wi&s;h I &s;aw it in that light; but what &s;ecurity have I again&s;t Mi&s;s Dormer's coming over? what again&s;t her marrying again, believing, as &s;he does, that I am dead?&mdash;that were a &s;troke that I &s;hould doubly feel. Another danger threatens me; her brother Dormer may
<PB N="5" REF="8">
return from &s;ea: his former pa&s;&s;ion for my Lady Davenant, and gratitude for my &s;ervices in getting him a &s;hip, will expo&s;e me to his vi&s;its: and I would &s;ooner meet the devil than the man I've wrong'd &s;o deeply.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Paget.</SPEAKER>
<P>'Twou'd not be plea&s;ant, I confe&s;s; but &s;urely 'twas reported he was kill'd in action with an enemy's &s;hip in the Ea&s;t Indies.</P>
</SP>

<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Ay, then you arm at every point for conque&s;t: but this &s;tranger&mdash;tell me, who is he?</P>
</SP>
<SP>

<P>Who is a greater &s;tranger than your Lord&s;hip? If I'm arm'd for conque&s;t, here's the heart I aim at.</P>

<PB N="6" REF="9">
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>P&s;haw! this is trifling; the&s;e are words in cour&s;e. If man and wife keep forms, 'tis all that is requir'd; but to pretend a pa&s;&s;ion, and talk of love to a hu&s;band&mdash;'tis an affecta|tion that lowers your under&s;tanding, but cannot impo&s;e upon mine. In the name of rea&s;on, Lady Davenant, make your&s;elf an agreeable wife, but do not &s;ink into that mo&s;t in&s;ipid of all charac|ters, a good &s;ort of woman.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>And what is your de&s;cription of a good &s;ort of woman?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>She is one that keeps the command|ments, hears &s;ermons, talks a little innocent &s;candal, and &s;colds the &s;ervants.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Now tell me your receipt for an agreeable wife.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>An agreeable wife to a man of the world is a woman of the world; one who fol|lows her own pur&s;uits, and does not cro&s;s tho&s;e of her hu&s;band. Let me &s;peak to you with &s;in|cerity&mdash;we married for convenience; there is a di&s;parity in our ages; I was a widower, with a &s;on as old as your&s;elf; you an orphan girl of fortune, a &s;lave to the humours of your uncle: you purcha&s;ed liberty by the &s;acrifice of incli|nation.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>How does that appear, my Lord?</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Beyond a doubt; you know your heart was never mine; you know you was in love with Dormer; would have married him; was thwarted in your fir&s;t affection, and took me
<PB N="7" REF="10">
upon duty&mdash;I might have &s;aid upon compul|&s;ion; for I was your uncle's choice, not your's.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>Hold there, whil&s;t I declare to you, in truth of heart, if Dormer had not given me up,&mdash;unkindly given me up&mdash;it was not duty, no, nor yet compul&s;ion, &s;hould have forced me to renounce him.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lord D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I give you credit for a fair confe&s;|&s;ion, and I draw this natural conclu&s;ion from it:&mdash;The woman who has loved, will love again&mdash;I am content. Let me &s;peak plainly to you: you are young, hand&s;ome, &s;en&s;ible, &s;u&s;ceptible: I am declining from the prime of life, a lover of my ea&s;e, and, I confe&s;s to you, not over uxo|rious. Why &s;hould we re&s;train each other? Why &s;hould marriage, that &s;trikes off other women's fetters, put on your's? live as women of your rank live; let your life be neither that of a town libertine, nor this, which you now lead, of a matrimonial mope.</P>
</SP>
<SP>
<SPEAKER>Lady D.</SPEAKER>
<P>I under&s;tand you, my Lord: but if I am better plea&s;ed to &s;ubmit to the chagrin of your neglect, than to the reproaches of my own con&s;cience, you will &s;uffer me to pur&s;ue a dull choice, and be the object of your contempt, ra|ther than of my own. I'll not di&s;gui&s;e from you that my heart is made for love, &s;oft and &s;ubject to temptation; therefore I avoid it: it once be|longed to Dormer; he returned it wounded, bleeding to its owner; 'twas healed, made whole, and offered to Lord Davenant; if you
<PB N="8" REF="11">
will not receive it, you may &s;end it back to me, as Dormer did; but you &s;hall never make it common property, a&s;&s;ure your&s;elf.</P>

<SP>

Her uncle's op|po&s;ition, and her better de&s;tiny, traver&s;ed my too ambitious hopes, and re&s;erved her to a worthier choice. Though there was &s;omething harder than I could have expected in her manner of di&s;mi&s;&s;ing me, &s;till, upon reflection, I cannot condemn the lady, who had prudence to reject an in&s;olent pretender with the &s;corn he merited: nay, I am vain enough to flatter my&s;elf, her uncle dictated expre&s;&s;ions that did not originate with her:&mdash;be that as it may, I have bequeathed my fortune to her upon failure of my &s;i&s;ter and her heirs.</P>

My &s;i&s;ter's marriage in Flanders I mu&s;t con&s;ider as precipitate and ra&s;h; the evidence of Brooke's decea&s;e at Paris was too readily ad|mitted;
<PB N="59" REF="62">

<L>TO-night two &s;ketches we've held up to view,</L>
<L>One of the old &s;chool, t'other of the new.</L>
<L>As for my Lady's portrait, I can't boa&s;t</L>
<L>Its likene&s;s, for the original is lo&s;t:</L>
<L>In times foregone the colouring might be good,</L>
<L>But now it &s;carce re&s;embles fle&s;h and blood:</L>
<L>The pencil's cha&s;te&mdash;but where, I wou'd demand,</L>
<L>Are the &s;oft touches of a modern hand?</L>
<L>Where the fond langui&s;h that our ma&s;ters &s;teal?</L>
<L>The tempting bo&s;om that our dames reveal?</L>
<L>Where the high plume that &s;peaks the towering &s;oul?</L>
<L>Where the bright glo&s;s that varni&s;hes the whole?</L>
<L>The habit regimental, &s;mart cockade,</L>
<L>And the neat ankle rogui&s;hly di&s;play'd?</L>
<L>None, none of the&s;e&mdash;a piece of mere &s;till life,</L>
<L>Where not one feature marks the modern wife.</L>

<L>Lay the good dame a&s;ide&mdash;and now behold</L>
<L>My Lord appears!&mdash;The&s;e tints are fre&s;h and bold;</L>
<L>This is the life it&s;elf. Mark! what a grace</L>
<L>Beams in his high-born tyranny of face!</L>
<L>He breathes; he &s;peaks. Cards, harlots, hor&s;es, dice</L>
<L>Croud the back-ground with attributes of vice:</L>
<L>This, this is &s;omething like; the&s;e colours give</L>
<L>Some &s;emblance of a man: <HI>'Tis &s;o we live,</HI></L>

<L>But one word more on <HI>Lady Davenant</HI>'s part,</L>
