<HEAD>LESSONS
FOR CHILDREN,
OF THREE YEARS OLD.</HEAD>
<P>GOOD morrow, little
boy! how do you do?
Bring your little &s;tool, and
&s;it down by me, for I have
a great deal to tell you.</P>
<PB N="4" REF="4">
<P>I hope you have been a good
boy, and read all the pretty
words I wrote for you before.
You have, you &s;ay; You
have read them till you are
tired, and you want &s;ome
more new le&s;&s;ons. Come
then, &s;it down. Now you
and I will tell &s;tories.</P>
<PB N="5" REF="5">
<P>What is to day, Charles?</P>
<P>To day is Sunday.</P>
<P>And what is to morrow?</P>
<P>To morrow will be Mon|day.</P>
<P>And what will the next
day be?</P>
<P>The next day will be Tue&s;|day.</P>
<PB N="6" REF="6">
<P>And the next day?</P>
<P>Wedne&s;day.</P>
<P>And the next?</P>
<P>Thur&s;day.</P>
<P>And the next?</P>
<P>Friday.</P>
<P>And the next?</P>
<P>Saturday.</P>
<P>And what will come after
Saturday?</P>
<PB N="7" REF="7">
<P>Why then, Sunday will
come again.</P>
<P>Sunday, Monday, Tue&s;day,
Wedne&s;day, Thur&s;day, Fri|day,
Saturday. That makes
&s;even days, and &s;even days
make</P>
<P>A week.</P>
<P>And do you know how
much four weeks make?</P>
<PB N="8" REF="8">
<P>How much?</P>
<P>A month. And twelve
months make a year&mdash;Janua|ry,
February, March, April,
May, June, July, Augu&s;t,
September, October, Novem|ber,
December.</P>
<PB N="9" REF="9">
<P>It is January. It is very
cold. It &s;nows. It freezes.
There are no leaves upon the
trees. The oil is frozen, and
the milk is frozen, and the
river is frozen, and every
thing.</P>
<P>All the boys are &s;liding.
You mu&s;t learn to &s;lide. There
<PB N="10" REF="10">
is a man &s;kaiting. How fa&s;t
he goes! You &s;hall have a
pair of &s;kates. Take care!
there is a hole in the ice.
Come in. It is four o'clock.
It is dark. Light the can|dles;
and Ralph! get &s;ome
wood from the wood-hou&s;e,
and get &s;ome coals, and make
a very good fire.</P>
<PB N="11" REF="11">
<P>February is very cold too,
but the days are longer, and
there is a yellow crocus com|ing
up, and the mezereon
tree is in blo&s;&s;om, and there
are &s;ome white &s;now-drops
peeping up their little heads.
Pretty white &s;now-drop, with
<PB N="12" REF="12">
a green &s;talk! May I ga|ther
it? Yes, you may,
but you mu&s;t always a&s;k leave
before you gather a flower.
What a noi&s;e the rooks make!
Caw, caw, caw; and how
bu&s;y they are! They are
going to build their ne&s;ts.
There is a man ploughing the
field.</P>
<PB N="13" REF="13">
<P>It is March. Now the
wind blows! It will blow
&s;uch a little fellow as you
away, almo&s;t. There is a
tree blown down.</P>
<P>Here are &s;ome young lambs.
Poor things! how they creep
under the hedge. What is
this flower? A primro&s;e.</P>
<PB N="14" REF="14">
<P>April is come, and the
birds &s;ing, and the trees are
in blo&s;&s;om, and flowers are
coming out, and butterflies,
and the &s;un &s;hines. Now
it rains. It rains and the
&s;un &s;hines. There is a rain-bow.
<PB N="15" REF="15">
O what fine colours!
Pretty bright rain-bow! No,
you cannot catch it, it is in
the &s;ky. It is going away.
It fades. it is quite gone.
I hear the cuckow. He &s;ays,
cuckow! cuckow! He is
come to tell us it is &s;pring.</P>
<PB N="16" REF="16">
<P>It is May. O plea&s;ant
May! Let us walk out in
the fields. The hawthorn
is in blo&s;&s;om. Let us go and
get &s;ome out of the hedges.
And here are dai&s;ies, and
cow&s;lips, and crow-flowers.
We will make a no&s;egay.
Here is a bit of thread to tie
<PB N="17" REF="17">
it with. Smell! It is very
&s;weet. What has Billy got?
He has got a ne&s;t of young
birds. He has been climb|ing
a high tree for them.
Poor little birds! they have
no feathers. Keep them
warm. You mu&s;t feed them
with a quill. You mu&s;t give
them bread and milk. They
<PB N="18" REF="18">
are young goldfinches. They
will be very pretty, when
they have got their red head
and yellow wings. Do not
let them die. The little
birds, papa and mamma will
be very &s;orry if they come
to die. O do not eat green
goo&s;e-berries! they will make
you ill.</P>
<PB N="19" REF="19">
<P>June is come. Get up!
you mu&s;t not lie &s;o long in
bed now; you mu&s;t get up,
and walk before breakfa&s;t.
What noi&s;e is that? It is
the mower &s;harpening his
&s;cythe. He is going to cut
down the gra&s;s. And will
<PB N="20" REF="20">
he cut down all the flowers
too? Yes, every thing. The
&s;cythe is very &s;harp. Do
not come near it; you will
have your legs cut off. Now
we mu&s;t make hay. Where
is your fork, and rake?
Spread the hay. Now make
it up in cocks. Now tum|ble
on the hay cock. There!
<PB N="21" REF="21">
cover him up with hay.
How &s;weet the hay &s;mells!
O, it is very hot! No mat|ter;
you mu&s;t make hay
while the &s;un &s;hines. You
mu&s;t work well. See, all
the lads and la&s;&s;es are at work.
They mu&s;t have &s;ome beer,
and bread, and chee&s;e. Now
put the hay in the cart. Will
<PB N="22" REF="22">
you ride in the cart? Huz|za!
Hay is for papa's hor&s;e
to eat in winter, when there
is no gra&s;s.</P>
<P>Do you love &s;trawberries
and cream? Let us go then,
and gather &s;ome &s;trawberries.
They are ripe now. Here
is a very large one. It is
almo&s;t too big to go into
<PB N="23" REF="23">
your mouth. Get me a
bunch of currants. Strip
them from the &s;talk. The
birds have pecked all the
cherries. Where is Charles?
He is &s;itting under a ro&s;e-bu&s;h.</P>
<PB N="24" REF="24">
<P>July is very hot indeed,
and the gra&s;s and flowers are
all burnt, for it has not rain|ed
a great while. You mu&s;t
water your garden, el&s;e the
plants will die. Where is
the watering-pot? Let us
go under the trees. It is
<PB N="25" REF="25">
&s;hady there, it is not &s;o hot.
Come into the arbour. There
is a bee upon the honey&s;uc|kle.
He is getting honey.
He will carry it to the hive.
Will you go and bathe in
the water? Here is water.
It is not deep. Pull off your
cloaths. Jump in. Do not
be afraid. Pop your head in.</P>
<PB N="26" REF="26">
<P>Now you have been
long enough. Come out, and
let me dry you with this
towel.</P>
<PB N="27" REF="27">
<P>It is Augu&s;t. Let us go
into the corn fields to &s;ee if
the corn is almo&s;t ripe. Yes,
it is quite brown: it is ripe.
Farmer Diggory! you mu&s;t
bring a &s;harp &s;ickle and cut
down the corn; it is ripe.
Eat &s;ome, Charles; rub it
<PB N="28" REF="28">
in your hands. This is a
grain of corn; this is an ear
of corn; this &s;talk makes
&s;traw. Now it mu&s;t be tied
up in &s;heaves. Now put a
great many &s;heaves together,
and make a &s;hock. Put it
in the cart, farmer Diggory!
carry it to your barn to make
bread. Sing harve&s;t home!
<PB N="29" REF="29">
harve&s;t home! There is a
poor old woman, picking up
&s;ome ears of corn; and a
poor little girl that has no
cloaths, hardly. They are
gleaning. Give them your
handful, Charles. Take it,
poor woman! it will help to
make you a loaf. Poor wo|man!
&s;he is very old, &s;he
<PB N="30" REF="30">
cannot run; &s;he is &s;adly tired
with &s;tooping.</P>
<P>It is Sptember. Hark!
&s;omebody is letting off a gun.
They are &s;hooting the poor
birds. Here is a bird dropped
down ju&s;t at your feet. It is
all bloody. Poor thing! how
<PB N="31" REF="31">
it flutters. Its wing is broke.
It cannot fly any further. It
is going to die. What bird is
it? It is a partridge. Are
you not &s;orry, Charles? it
was alive a little while ago.</P>
<P>Bring the ladder, and &s;et
it again&s;t the tree. Now
bring a ba&s;ket. We mu&s;t
gather apples. No, you
<PB N="32" REF="32">
cannot go up the ladder;
you mu&s;t have a little ba&s;ket,
and pick up apples under the
tree. Shake the tree. Down
they come. How many have
you got? We will have an
apple dumpling. Come, you
mu&s;t help to carry the apples
into the apple chamber. Ap|ples
make cyder. You &s;hall
<PB N="33" REF="33">
have &s;ome baked pears and
bread for &s;upper. Are the&s;e
apples? No, they are quin|ces,
they will make mar|malade.</P>
<PB N="34" REF="34">
<P>October is come, Charles;
and the leaves are falling off
the trees; and the flowers
are all gone. No, here is an
African marygold, and a
China-after, and a Michael|mas
dai&s;y. Will you have
any nuts? Fetch the nut-crackers.
Peel this walnut.
<PB N="35" REF="35">
I will make you a little boat
of the walnut-&s;hell. We mu&s;t
get the grapes, or el&s;e the
birds will eat them all. Here
is a bunch of black grapes.
Here is a bunch of white
ones. Which will you have?
Grapes make wine.</P>
<P>What bird have you got
there? It is dead, but it is
<PB N="36" REF="36">
very pretty. It has a &s;carlet
eye, and red, and green
and purple feathers. It is
very large. It is a phea&s;ant.
He is very good to eat. We
will pull off his feathers and
tell Betty Cook to roa&s;t him.
Here is a hare too. Poor
pu&s;s! The hounds did catch
her.</P>
<PB N="37" REF="37">
<P>Dark di&s;mal November is
come. No more flowers!
no more hay-making! The
&s;ky is very black; the rain
pours down. Well, never
mind it. We will &s;it by the
fire, and read, and tell
<PB N="38" REF="38">
&s;tories, and look at pictures.
Where is Billy, and Harry,
and little Bet&s;y? Now tell
me who can &s;pell be&s;t. Good
boy! There is a clever
fellow! Now you &s;hall all
have &s;ome cake.</P>
<PB N="39" REF="39">
<P>It is December, and
Chri&s;tmas is coming, and
Betty is very bu&s;y. What
is &s;he doing? She is paring
apples, and chopping meat,
and beating &s;pice. What
for, I wonder! It is to
<PB N="40" REF="40">
make mince-pies. Do you
love mince-pies? O they
are very good! Little boys
come from &s;chool at Chri&s;t|mas.
Pray wrap them up
warm, for it is very cold.
Well, Spring will come a|gain
&s;ometime.</P>
<PB N="41" REF="41">
<P>How many fingers have
you got, little boy?</P>
<P>Here are four fingers on
this hand; and what is this?
Thumb. Four fingers and
thumb, that makes five.
And how many on the other
hand?</P>
<PB N="42" REF="42">
<P>There are five too.</P>
<P>What hand is this?</P>
<P>This is the right hand.</P>
<P>And this? This is the
left hand.</P>
<P>And how many toes have
you got? Let us count.</P>
<P>Five upon this foot, and
five upon this foot.</P>
<P>Five and five makes ten:
<PB N="43" REF="43">
ten fingers and ten toes.</P>
<P>How many legs have you?</P>
<P>Here is one, and here is a|nother.
Charles has two legs.</P>
<P>How many legs has a hor&s;e?</P>
<P>A hor&s;e has four legs.</P>
<P>And how many has a dog?</P>
<P>Four: and a cow has
four; and a &s;heep has four;
and pu&s;s has four legs.</P>
<PB N="44" REF="44">
<P>And how many legs have
the chickens?</P>
<P>Go and look.</P>
<P>The chickens have only
two legs.</P>
<P>And the linnets, and the
robins, and all the birds,
have only two legs.</P>
<P>But I will tell you what
birds have got; they have
<PB N="45" REF="45">
got wings to fly with, and
they fly very high in the air.</P>
<P>Charles has no wings.</P>
<P>No, becau&s;e Charles is not
a bird.</P>
<P>Charles has got hands.
Cows have no hands, and
birds have no hands.</P>
<P>Have birds teeth? No,
they have no teeth.</P>
<PB N="46" REF="46">
<P>How do they eat their
victuals then?</P>
<P>Birds have got a bill. Look
at the chickens, they pick
up the corn in their little
bills. See how fa&s;t they
pick it up.</P>
<P>Charles's mouth is &s;oft;
the chicken's bill is hard
like bone.</P>
<PB N="47" REF="47">
<P>How many legs have
fi&s;hes?</P>
<P>Fi&s;hes have no legs at all.
How do they walk then?
They do not walk; they
&s;wim about in the water;
they live always in the water.</P>
<P>Charles could not live un|der
the water.</P>
<PB N="48" REF="48">
<P>No, becau&s;e Charles is not
a fi&s;h.</P>
<P>Here is a fi&s;h that &s;ome|body
has caught. Poor little
fi&s;h! throw it on the gra&s;s.
See how it flounces about!
It has a hook in its gills.
Take it by the tail. it is
&s;lippery, you cannot hold it.
<PB N="49" REF="49">
See, the&s;e are fins. It has
got fins to &s;wim with; and
it has got &s;cales, and &s;harp
teeth. It will be dead &s;oon.
It is going to die. It can|not
&s;tir any more. Now it
is quite dead. The fi&s;h dies
becau&s;e it is out of the water,
and Charles would die if he
was in the water.</P>
<PB N="50" REF="50">
<P>What has Charles got to
keep him warm?</P>
<P>Charles has got a frock
and warm petticoats.</P>
<P>And what have the poor
&s;heep got; have they petti|coats?</P>
<P>The &s;heep have got wool,
<PB N="51" REF="51">
thick warm wool. Feel it.
O, it is very comfortable!
That is their petticoat.</P>
<P>And what have hor&s;es got?</P>
<P>Hor&s;es have got long hair;
and cows have hair.</P>
<P>And what have birds got?</P>
<P>Birds have got feathers;
&s;oft, clean, &s;hining feathers.</P>
<PB N="52" REF="52">
<P>Birds build ne&s;ts in trees;
that is their hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The wolf has a den; that
is his hou&s;e.</P>
<P>The dog has a kennel.</P>
<P>The bees live in a hive.</P>
<P>The pigs live in a &s;tye.</P>
<P>Can you climb a tree?</P>
<P>No.</P>
<P>But you mu&s;t learn then.</P>
<PB N="53" REF="53">
<P>As &s;oon as you have breeches
you mu&s;t learn to climb
trees.</P>
<P>A&s;k pu&s;s to teach you; &s;he
can climb. See, how fa&s;t
&s;he climbs! She is at the
top. She wants to catch
birds. Pray pu&s;s do not take
the little birds that &s;ing &s;o
merrily! She has got a
<PB N="54" REF="54">
&s;parrow in her mouth. She
has eat it all up. No, here
are two or three feathers on
the ground all bloody. Poor
&s;parrow.</P>
<P>The dog barks. The hog
grunts. The pig &s;queaks.
The hor&s;e neighs. The cock
<PB N="55" REF="55">
crows. The a&s;s brays. The cat
purrs. The kitten mews. The
bull bellows. The cow lows.
The calf bleats. Sheep bleat.
The lion roars. The wolf
howls. The tyger growls.
The fox barks. Mice &s;queak.
The Frog croaks. The &s;par|row
chirps. The &s;wallow
twitters. The rook caws.
<PB N="56" REF="56">
The bittern booms. The pi|geon
coos. The turkey gob|bles.
The peacock &s;creams.
The beetle hums. The
gra&s;shopper chirps. The
duck quacks. The goo&s;e
cackles. Monkeys chatter.
The owl hoots. The &s;creech-owl
&s;hrieks. The &s;nake
hi&s;&s;es. Charles talks.</P>
<PB N="57" REF="57">
<P>Kites and hawks eat chick|ens.</P>
<P>Spiders make cobwebs;
they catch flies in them and
eat them up.</P>
<P>Owls fly in the night.</P>
<P>Butchers kill &s;heep.</P>
<P>The carpenter makes ta|bles
and boxes.</P>
<PB N="58" REF="58">
<P>You &s;hall have a box, with
a lock and a key to it.</P>
<P>The carpenter has a &s;aw,
and a chi&s;el, and a plane,
and an adze, and a gimblet,
and a turn-&s;crew, and a hatch|et,
and a file, and a vice,
and pincers, and a hammer,
and nails, and a mallet.</P>
<PB N="59" REF="59">
<P>Charles's wooden hor&s;e is
broke.</P>
<P>Well, take it to the car|penter's;
let him mend it.</P>
<P>Charles has fallen down
and broke his head.</P>
<P>Shall I take it to the car|penter's.</P>
<P>No, &s;illy boy! Carpenters
do not mend heads.</P>
<PB N="60" REF="60">
<P>Shoe-makers make &s;hoes.</P>
<P>Old people wear &s;pecta|cles.</P>
<P>Good boys love to read.</P>
<P>The barber &s;haves.</P>
<P>Come papa! &s;it down;
you mu&s;t have your beard
&s;haved.</P>
<PB N="61" REF="61">
<P>Here is the &s;oap, and the
ba&s;on, and the razor.</P>
<P>Barber, do not cut papa.</P>
<P>Shall we go into the garden,
and &s;ee the flowers, and the
apple trees, and run about in
the gravel walk?</P>
<PB N="62" REF="62">
<P>Where is your roller?
Come roll the walk.</P>
<P>Work well, and perhaps
I may give you a halfpenny
a day. Every body works,
but little babies; they cannot
work.</P>
<P>If you are a good boy, you
&s;hall have a little garden of
your own, and a &s;pade to
<PB N="63" REF="63">
dig with, and a hoe, and a
rake, and a little wheelbar|row;
and pray do not let
me &s;ee any weeds in your
garden; pull them all up.
And you mu&s;t make a little
hedge about it, el&s;e the pigs
will get in and &s;poil it. And
you mu&s;t go to the gardener,
and &s;ay, pray give me &s;ome
<PB N="64" REF="64">
&s;eeds; and you mu&s;t &s;ow
them. You mu&s;t make a
little hole in the ground, and
put them in, and cover them
up with mould, and they
will grow. Here is &s;ome
cre&s;s and mu&s;tard &s;eed. Sow
it, and we will have a &s;allad.
Water your garden. Charles,
look at this goo&s;eberry bu&s;h;
<PB N="65" REF="65">
it was but &s;o high when we
put it in the ground, and now
it is a great deal taller; it is
&s;o high.</P>
<P>The goo&s;eberry bu&s;h grows.</P>
<P>Does Charles grow?</P>
<P>Yes; Charles could not
reach the table once, and
now he can reach higher a
great deal.</P>
<PB N="66" REF="66">
<P>Is the table taller than it
was a great while ago?</P>
<P>No; the table does not
grow.</P>
<P>Why does not the table
grow, Charles?</P>
<PB N="67" REF="67">
<P>Here is a lady-bird upon
a leaf. It is red and has
black &s;pots. Ah! it has
wings. It is flown away.
There is a black beetle.
Catch it. How fa&s;t it runs!
Where is it gone? Into the
ground. It makes a little
<PB N="68" REF="68">
hole and runs into the
ground. Worms live in the
ground.</P>
<P>It is cold, Charles, very
cold! Pray what do they
call it when it is &s;o cold?
They call it winter, you
<PB N="69" REF="69">
know. I wonder what poor
little boys do, that have no
fire to go to, and no &s;hoes
and &s;tockings to keep them
warm, and no good papas
and mammas to take care
of them and give them vic|tuals.
Poor little boys!
Do not cry, Charles, for
here is a halfpenny, and when
<PB N="70" REF="70">
you &s;ee one of tho&s;e poor
little boys you &s;hall give it
him: he will go and buy a
roll with it, for he is very
hungry; and he will &s;ay,
Thank you Charles, you are
very good to me!</P>
<P>I will tell you what,
Charles; it will be a great
deal colder &s;oon, and &s;now
<PB N="71" REF="71">
will come down. Then the
pretty little robins will
come and fly again&s;t the
windows. Open the win|dow.
Well, what do you
want, little robin? Only a
few crumbs of bread. Give
him &s;ome crumbs and he
will hop, hop, about the
parlour, and &s;it upon the
<PB N="72" REF="72">
top of the &s;creen, and &s;ing;
O he will &s;ing all day long!
Now pray do not let that
wicked cat take him. No,
pu&s;s! you mu&s;t go and catch
mice, you &s;hall not eat poor
robin. There was a cruel
naughty boy once&mdash;I will
tell you a &s;tory about him.</P>
<PB N="73" REF="73">
<P>There was a naughty boy;
I do not know what his
name was, but it was not
Charles, nor George, nor
Arthur, for tho&s;e are all ve|ry
pretty names: but there
was a robin came in at his
window one very cold morn|ing
<PB N="74" REF="74">
&mdash;&s;hiver&mdash;&s;hiver, and its
poor little heart was almo&s;t
frozen to death. And he
would not give it the lea&s;t
little crumb of bread in the
world, but pulled it about by
the tail, and hurt it &s;adly, and
it died. Now a little while
after the naughty boy's papa
and mamma went away and
<PB N="75" REF="75">
left him; and then he could
get no victuals at all, for you
know he could not take
care of him&s;elf. So he went
about to every body&mdash;Pray
give me &s;omething to eat,
I am very hungry. And
every body &s;aid, No, we
&s;hall give you none, for we
do not love cruel naughty
<PB N="76" REF="76">
boys. So he went about from
one place to another, till
at la&s;t he got into a thick
wood of trees, for he did
not know how to find his
way any where; and then it
grew dark, quite dark night.
So he &s;at down and cried
&s;adly; and he could not get
out of the wood; and I believe
<PB N="77" REF="77">
the bears came and eat him
up in the wood, for I never
heard any thing about him
afterwards.</P>
<P>I will tell you another
&s;tory.</P>
<PB N="78" REF="78">
<P>There was a little boy;
he was not a big boy, for if
he had been a big boy I &s;up|po&s;e
he would have been
wi&s;er; but this was a little
boy, not higher than the
table, and his papa and
mamma &s;ent him to &s;chool:
It was a very plea&s;ant morning;
<PB N="79" REF="79">
the &s;un &s;hone, and the birds
&s;ung in the trees. Now this
little boy did not much love
his book, for he was but
a &s;illy little boy as I told
you; and he had a great
mind to play in&s;tead of going
to &s;chool. And he &s;aw a
bee flying about, fir&s;t upon
one flower and then upon
<PB N="80" REF="80">
another; &s;o he &s;aid, Pretty
bee! will you come and play
with me? But the bee &s;aid,
No, I mu&s;t not be idle, I
mu&s;t go and gather honey.
Then the little boy met a
dog, and he &s;aid, Dog! will
you play with me? But
the dog &s;aid, No, I mu&s;t not
be idle, I am going to catch
<PB N="81" REF="81">
a hare for my ma&s;ter's dinner,
I mu&s;t make ha&s;te and catch
it. Then the little boy went
by a hay-rick, and he &s;aw
a bird pulling &s;ome hay out
of the hay-rick, and he &s;aid
Bird! will you come and
play with me? But the bird
&s;aid, No, I mu&s;t not be idle,
I mu&s;t get &s;ome hay to build
<PB N="82" REF="82">
my ne&s;t with, and &s;ome
mo&s;s, and &s;ome wool. So
the bird flew away. Then
the little boy &s;aw a hor&s;e,
and he &s;aid, Hor&s;e! will you
play with me? But the
hor&s;e &s;aid, No, I mu&s;t not
be idle, I mu&s;t go and plough,
or el&s;e there will be no corn
to make bread of. Then the
<PB N="83" REF="83">
little boy thought with him|&s;elf,
what, is no body idle?
then little boys mu&s;t not be
idle neither. So he made
ha&s;te, and went to &s;chool,
and learned his le&s;&s;on very
well, and the ma&s;ter &s;aid he
was a very good boy.</P>
<P>Farewell! good night.</P>
